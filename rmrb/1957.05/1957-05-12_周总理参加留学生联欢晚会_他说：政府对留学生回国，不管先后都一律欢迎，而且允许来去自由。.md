Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Beijing Returned Overseas Students Families Association held a grand soiree at the Beijing Hotel on the 10th. Over a thousand returned overseas students, their families, and Premier Zhou Enlai spent this spring evening together.

Before the soiree even began, the hall of the Beijing Hotel was filled with chatter and laughter, as people happily discussed their work and lives. In a corner of the hall, Dr. Xu Guanren and chemical expert Zhou Guangyu shook hands tightly. Xu Guanren specializes in the application of atomic energy in agriculture. Since returning to China from the United States a year ago, he had been wanting to meet his old classmate Zhou Guangyu. Zhou Guangyu's specialty, chromatography, is relevant to the specialized course Xu Guanren teaches at the Beijing Agricultural University. He invited Zhou Guangyu to give a lecture at the university. Dr. Wang Dezhao, a French returnee who once studied under the great French physicist Paul Langevin, met with Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education. They were classmates more than twenty years ago, and Wang Dezhao joked, "Back then, you were much taller than me, and I had to look up to see you."

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, President Guo Moruo, Minister of Health Li Dequan, Director of the State Technological Commission Huang Jing, and others, who were also invited to the soiree, happily chatted with the returned students.

At 8:40 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai arrived, and the entire venue immediately came to life, with applause erupting.

Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to speak at the soiree. He said that he was very happy to attend this soiree. "We not only welcome friends who have returned to the country in the past eight years, but also welcome the relatives of friends who are still abroad."

Premier Zhou spoke about the rectification movement in relation to correctly handling contradictions among the people. When discussing the issue of intellectuals, he analyzed in detail the characteristics of Chinese intellectuals, highly valuing their strengths and their role in revolution and construction, while also earnestly pointing out the weaknesses that Chinese intellectuals should overcome and the directions in which they should strive.

Premier Zhou Enlai once again expressed his welcome to returned overseas students. He said that returned overseas students since the founding of the People’s Republic have played a significant role in various work positions. However, they have also encountered some difficulties. For example, what they have learned may not be fully applicable after returning to China, the equipment may not be complete, and the assistants may not be sufficient. Moreover, these work-related contradictions may also be linked to academic contradictions, perhaps slowing down their academic progress. He encouraged returned overseas students to overcome difficulties and resolve contradictions. But he pointed out that even if old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise.

Premier Zhou said: "China's economy and culture have been lagging behind for a long time, and the material base is underdeveloped, so there are many difficulties in conducting scientific research. The Chinese people have now stood up and have greatly improved compared to the past, but it is not easy to replace ragged clothes with a brand-new set. The great development of productivity takes time, and it cannot be done without time." He said that the living standards of the Chinese people have improved a lot, but they are still low, and it is impossible to improve them quickly all at once. He encouraged everyone to be hardworking, enduring, and to build socialism through arduous struggle.

The Premier then said: "We welcome overseas students who are still abroad and have not yet returned to China to come back. But we must also understand the difficulties in their lives and circumstances, and we should not add to their difficulties."

Premier Zhou said: "The government welcomes returned students regardless of when they return. We treat everyone equally and allow them to come and go freely. Now, overseas students who want to come back and take a look before going out again are allowed to do so, and those who have already returned are also allowed to go out if they wish." He said, "Today, we have no 'iron curtain' or 'bamboo curtain.' The 'iron curtain' is on the side of imperialism, and they dare not let people out. Our socialist mass base is solid, so we dare to do this."

As soon as the Premier left the podium, he was surrounded by people. Wu Keqi, who returned from France in 1953 and now works at the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, hurried forward to shake hands with the Premier and said, "When I was in France, I met some of your former classmates. They all talked about your time as a student and your stories of participating in the revolution." After Premier Zhou shook hands with scientists Wu Zhonghua and Li Minhua, the people next to him introduced them as a couple who had won the Chinese Academy of Sciences Award. The Premier then said, "You are both very young!" Yao Yongli, a professor at the Foreign Affairs College, told the Premier that he is now teaching but is very interested in many issues in international relations. The Premier said, "Research on international affairs is very necessary, and we should strive to catch up."

It was twelve o'clock, but the Premier had not yet left. He watched dance and acrobatic performances with everyone and danced together.

    周总理参加留学生联欢晚会
    他说：政府对留学生回国，不管先后都一律欢迎，而且允许来去自由。
    据新华社11日讯　北京市留美学生家属联谊会，10日在北京饭店举行了盛大的联欢晚会。一千多位归国留学生、留学生家属和周恩来总理欢度了这个春天的夜晚。
    晚会还未开始，北京饭店的大厅里就是一片谈笑声，人们愉快地谈论着工作和生活。大厅的一角，徐冠仁博士和化学专家周光宇紧紧地握着手。徐冠仁是专门研究原子能在农业中应用的。他从美国回国一年来，总想和老同学周光宇见见面。周光宇的专长——色层分析法，对徐冠仁在北京农业大学讲的专业课有关系。他约了周光宇到学校去讲课。曾经向法国大物理学家郎之万学习过的法国留学生汪德昭博士同高等教育部部长杨秀峰会见了，二十多年前他们是同学，汪德昭开玩笑地说，那时你比我高得多，我要仰起头来才能见到你。
    应邀参加这个晚会的聂荣臻副总理，郭沫若院长，卫生部长李德全，国家技术委员会主任黄敬等也和归国的学生们欢乐地交谈。
    八点四十分，周恩来总理来了，全场立刻活跃起来，鼓掌声四起。
    周恩来总理应邀在会上讲了话。他说，今天参加这个晚会很高兴。我们不但欢迎八年来归国的朋友们，而且欢迎还在国外的朋友们的亲属。
    周总理从正确处理人民内部矛盾谈到整风运动。在谈到知识分子问题时，他详细地分析了中国知识分子的特点，对知识分子的长处和他们在革命和建设中的作用作了很高的估价，同时也恳切地指出了中国知识分子所应该克服的弱点和努力方向。
    周恩来总理再次表示欢迎归国的留学生。他说，开国以来陆续回国的留学生在各种工作岗位上发挥了很大的作用。但是也遇到了一些困难。譬如回国后他所学到的东西不一定能够全部用上，设备也不见得全，帮手也可能不够。不仅如此，这些工作上的矛盾也就会联系到学术上的矛盾，也许因此使自己的学术进步缓慢起来。他鼓励归国留学生们克服困难，解决矛盾。但是他指出：旧的矛盾解决了，也还有新的矛盾产生。
    周总理说：中国经济、文化长期落后，物质基础不发展，因而进行科学研究是有很多困难的。中国人民现在翻了身，比过去有了很大改善，但要把破烂衣服换成全新的一套是不容易的。生产力的大发展需要时间，没有时间不行。他说目前我国人民的生活水平已经有了不少提高，但还是很低，而且也不可能一下子很快提高。他勉励大家要吃苦耐劳，要艰苦奋斗地建设社会主义。
    总理接着说：我们欢迎仍在海外的未回国的留学生回国。但是我们也要谅解他们的生活和处境的困难，我们更不应该去增加他们的困难。
    周总理说：政府对于留学生回国，不管先后我们都一律欢迎，一视同仁，而且允许来去自由。现在国外的留学生想回来看看再出去，是可以的，已经回国的愿意出去，也可以。他说，今天我们没有什么“铁幕”、“竹幕”。“铁幕”是在帝国主义那一边，他们不敢放人出来。我们社会主义的群众基础是巩固的，所以敢于这样做。
    总理刚离开了讲台，就被人们包围起来。1953年归国的法国留学生吴克祺现在科学院经济研究所工作，他见到总理后赶紧跑上去握手，并且对总理说：我在法国时曾遇到过一些你过去的同学，他们都谈起了你求学时代的情况，并谈到了你参加革命的故事。周总理同科学家吴仲华、李敏华夫妇握手后，旁边的人介绍说他们即是获得科学院奖金的一对夫妇，总理接着说：你们都很年青啊！外交学院教授姚永励告诉总理他现在担任教学任务，但对国际关系上的许多问题很感兴趣。总理说：国际方面的研究很需要，应该努力赶上去。
    十二时了，总理还没有离开，他和大家一同看了舞蹈和杂技节目，并且一齐跳了舞。
