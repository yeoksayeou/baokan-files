Qian Weichang Earnestly Discusses Contradictions
"I am an old Tsinghua member, but in recent years, the feeling of being the master of our own house has become increasingly thin."
When a reporter asked Professor Qian Weichang to talk about the internal contradictions at Tsinghua University, Mr. Qian said on the phone: "I have said enough, people have a lot of opinions about me, let's find another professor!" After the reporter's explanation and request, he agreed. On the morning of the 11th, when I stepped into a reception room in Zhaolan Courtyard, Mr. Qian unexpectedly said, "How much time do you have!" I said, "Time is not limited." And so the conversation began.

"Universities and colleges should mainly rely on old professors"

"I am an old Tsinghua member, and I have always dared to speak and act, but in recent years, the feeling of being the master of our own house has become increasingly thin. I really want to get involved in many things, but I can't make decisions, because there is another line (referring to the Party's work) that always moves faster than you." Qian Weichang was previously the Dean of Studies at the school and is now the Vice President. The reporter then asked, "Does this involve the issue of having position, power, and responsibility!" "Of course, it is not entirely true that there is no power," he analyzed this thought-provoking situation. Qian Weichang said that the Party's power is great, and it is easy to implement an intention, but our work is completely different. I only participate in two ends of the work: giving advice before a decision is made, and ensuring implementation after the decision is made, let's call it "import" and "export." I am completely ignorant of how it was discussed, arranged, and decided in between, these crucial issues. He also cited the example of the School Affairs Committee, saying that whenever a meeting is held to decide on a major issue in the school, the Party's responsible cadre always introduces the situation, the problem is analyzed very comprehensively, and no one will vote against it, so it is smoothly passed. We don't know a lot of the Party's internal information, and we professors have less knowledge of the situation, and some of our views may be one-sided, so it is difficult to speak in some situations. He said that the School Affairs Committee is actually a formality and does not play the role of non-Party members.

"Who should universities and colleges rely on? They should mainly rely on old professors," Qian Weichang said in an affirmative tone. He believes that not only is this the case at Tsinghua, but the underestimation of the role and enthusiasm of old professors in universities and colleges across the country is a widespread and serious problem. He said that the current situation is that people are first divided into two categories, and the advantages of one category are always looked at first, while the disadvantages of the other category are looked at first. Looking at people with such a "preconceived" view creates a wall. Tsinghua always views old professors with suspicion. He gave the following example: A young man in the Foundry Teaching and Research Group made a study plan to solve twelve major scientific problems within three years. The plan was shown to Soviet experts, who severely criticized it, because each problem could be at the level of a doctoral dissertation if solved. We have no reason to blame the young man for being overly ambitious, but the director of the teaching and research group is aware of the situation, so why didn't he intervene? He was afraid that any intervention would be labeled as suppressing new forces. Qian Weichang said, how can they be asked to do a good job of leadership in such an atmosphere? According to him, most department and teaching and research group directors at Tsinghua do not truly run the show, and are at most stuck in administrative work. He also said that Professor Liang Sicheng, the director of the Architecture Department, has been holding an empty title for the past few years and has never been involved in the department's teaching. Moreover, it is sad that such a prestigious and talented professor does not even have a disciple. Qian Weichang took a puff of his cigarette and asked: If we don't learn from experienced and specialized old professors, who should we learn from? If we don't turn this around, a crisis will come.

"I don't agree with President Jiang's statement"

"President Jiang Nanxiang mentioned in the Guangming Daily that there are probably five formulations regarding the school leadership system, what are Mr. Qian's opinions?" Initially, he did not directly answer the reporter's question, but said bluntly that he did not agree with President Jiang's statement: "We should pay attention to ensuring that everyone gets what they deserve, pay attention to the role of old professors, and also pay attention to cultivating young teachers." Qian Weichang believes that this statement seems comprehensive on the surface, but in essence, this comprehensiveness serves a one-sided purpose. Putting old professors on an equal footing with young professors is simply the "old trick" of disrespecting old professors! Then, he paced back and forth away from the sofa, turned around and asked: "Why are so many old professors unwilling to stay in schools with a long history and want to go to the Academy of Sciences? Is it simply for research work? No, in recent years, the quiet and solemn atmosphere in schools has really made people uncomfortable." He cited many examples, saying that some people who old professors think are not promising are allowed to enter the teaching and research office as teaching assistants. Major issues such as selecting students to study abroad and promoting teachers have not been solicited from the professors at all, and only the Party and administrative lines are followed. He said that in the Soviet Union, a professor or director of a teaching and research group is greatly respected by the school and the people. In the Soviet Union, a professor can arbitrarily choose a teaching assistant as his assistant, and if the professor believes that his assistant is not qualified, he can immediately dismiss him, and the school authorities are very respectful.

Therefore, Qian Weichang's view is that the Party's work must continue to be strengthened without a doubt. Under the premise of fully relying on old professors, the Party mainly strengthens the education and leadership of professors. Important academic and teaching issues should be led by old professors, old professors should stand in an authoritative position in a certain major, and old professors should be given absolute decisive power in promoting teaching assistants to lecturers and lecturers to professors.

"Tense atmosphere, thin human feelings"

Mr. Qian became more and more enthusiastic as he spoke, and he made the following assessment of the internal contradictions at Tsinghua University: Tsinghua has many problems, but there is nothing remarkable compared to other schools. First of all, an objective reason is that the Party's leadership is relatively strong. Another reason, he said meaningfully, is that Tsinghua can also be said to be a "children's school," with many teacher-student and classmate relationships. Sometimes, if work cannot be carried out smoothly, the qualifications of a teacher or classmate can be used to solve some problems.

The past seems to be something worth cherishing. Mr. Qian said that in the past, our professors' homes were always full of people coming and going, so some problems were solved invisibly without having to hold meetings. Now, everyone "plays by the rules" and handles official business with a straight face, especially the relationship between teachers and students is not harmonious. He said excitedly: "If you want to help him academically, he will study with a skeptical and critical attitude, and even struggle against you. How can you teach in this way? And how can you learn?" He also cited the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns as examples, saying that it is important for intellectuals to transform their thinking, but some young people only focus on people's shortcomings, and even reveal some problems in their private lives, which damages the self-esteem of older people. Afterwards, they become cautious, and the atmosphere becomes very tense whenever a meeting is held. They even record all their own and others' speeches in order to have a record to check and prevent being caught by the pigtails.

Qian Weichang said that a teacher with expertise always hopes to train his disciples to become talents, just like the ancients said, "hoping that one's son will become a dragon." In the past, he studied with Mr. Wu Youxun (the current Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences). In recent years, he has also cultivated some very promising talents. He said that the growth of Hu Haichang and Ye Kaiyuan (who won the Academy of Sciences Award) only took four or five years. They are humble and active in learning, and I am happy to guide them. What is wrong with unity and friendship between teachers and students? I heard that someone is criticizing the "Hu Haichang Line," but I really don't know where to start. He also talked about the fact that seven or eight young people from outside the school came to him to study without any organizational relationship, becoming his private disciples, and he gladly accepted them.

He also mentioned that the excessive demands in the entire educational ideology are the reason for the tense atmosphere in the school and the heavy mental burden on teachers and students. Currently, a surprising phenomenon has emerged in the school: it has happened more than once that students will cry when they get a "four points" on an exam. Qian Weichang said that our old Tsinghua students' homework was no easier than it is now, but the learning mood was relaxed and happy. Sometimes, if you failed an exam and got a "pistol," you just let it go and started learning from scratch. He believes that work and study should be tense, but mental burdens should never be artificially created.

"There is too little academic atmosphere at present"

As an old professor with decades of teaching and scientific research experience, it is impossible for him not to have his own views on some major teaching issues, and this is especially true for Professor Qian. Qian Weichang said: "There is too little academic atmosphere at present."

He has reservations about the statement of "teaching first, then scientific research." In the past, the quality of teaching was not high, and we always emphasized technical issues such as teaching methods and lesson preparation, which was also wrong. He said that the key to quality lies in the continuous improvement of teachers' academic level through scientific research. At this point, he went to get a clipping for the reporter to see, which contained his opinions that he had published in the People's Daily several times, but had not received leadership attention.

Qian Weichang also talked to the reporter about an unpleasant matter. A few months ago, he published articles on training objectives in the Guangming Daily and the People's Daily one after another. Soon after, he heard from the leadership that his articles had caused a bad influence among students and shaken everyone's learning mood, saying that they wanted to organize everyone to discuss it. He said with a smile that the name was "discussion," but in reality, it was "criticism." The leadership believed that his articles caused the following bad consequences: First, they negated learning from the Soviet Union; second, they doubted the achievements of socialist teaching; and third, they caused ideological confusion among students. Therefore, the nature of the original problem was transformed.

Qian Weichang said that I still want to talk about my views. I am against the statement that university graduates are engineers. University study is just laying a foundation, and true learning starts from production practice. Some professional knowledge that can be obtained through production practice should be streamlined to enrich basic training. He said that my views may not be 100% correct, but they can also be discussed or experimented with. More than a decade ago, there were as many as seven methods for separating the atomic energy isotope uranium, and no one convinced anyone. As a result, everyone went their own way, and everyone succeeded. Therefore, natural science will not develop without contention.

He also said that in the Soviet Union, a university also has two majors with the same name, which are trained by two factions of scholars using different methods that they consider most effective. Therefore, he said that we do not have to force mechanical unity, and in terms of professional settings and even the management of various schools, we can adopt a variety of methods to try, and it is possible that they will all work, or some will succeed and some will fail, so that we can eliminate the dross and extract the essence and learn from experience.

The conversation lasted for more than three hours. Finally, Qian Weichang told the reporter that the central government's instructions on rectification are timely. In the past, opinions had been held back for too long and too much, so we had to carry out a large-scale movement. He hopes that after this vigorous movement, it can be turned into a regular practice. Specifically, for Tsinghua, he believes that the leadership's policy of loosening up is affirmative, but the current situation is not a question of whether it is loose enough, but that it has not been released at all!

### 钱伟长语重心长谈矛盾  “我是老清华了，但是这些年来，当家作主的味道越来越稀薄了。”

专栏：

    钱伟长语重心长谈矛盾
   “我是老清华了，但是这些年来，当家作主的味道越来越稀薄了。”
    记者要求钱伟长教授谈谈清华大学内部矛盾的问题，钱先生在电话中说：“我说的话够多了，人家对我很有意见，还是找旁的教授吧！”经过记者的一番解释和请求，他同意了。11日上午，当我踏进照澜院的一间会客室时，钱先生出人意料地这么讲：“你能有多长时间啊！”我说：“不限时间吧。”话匣子就揭开了。
   “高等学校应该主要依靠老教授”
   “我是老清华了，一向是敢说敢做的，但是这些年来，当家作主的味道越来越稀薄了。许多事情很想插手，但是做不了主，因为另外有一条线（指党的工作）总是比你走得快。”钱伟长以前是学校的教务长，现在是副校长。记者就问：“这是否牵涉到有职、有权、有责的问题呢！”“当然完全无权也不符事实”他分析了这种值得令人深思的情况。钱伟长说，党的力量大，一个意图贯彻起来很容易，我们作事就完全不一样。我只参加了两头工作：事情还未作出决定前提提意见，决定以后就保证执行，姑且称它谓“进口”和“出口”。究竟其间是怎样讨论的、布置的和决定的，这些关键性的问题就茫然无知了。他还举校务委员会的例子说，每当开会决定学校里的一个重大问题时，总是由党内负责干部介绍一下情况，问题分析得很全面，谁也不会投反对票，就这样顺利通过了。党内有好多资料我们不知道，我们这些作教授的掌握情况少，有的看法很可能是片面的，所以有些场合就很难发言。他说，校务委员会实际是形式主义的东西，并没有发挥党外人士的作用。
   “在高等学校究竟依靠谁呢？应该主要依靠老教授。”钱伟长以肯定的语气说。他认为，不仅清华如此，目前全国高等学校对老教授的作用和积极性的估计不足是个普遍、严重的问题。他说，现在的情况是首先把人分成了两类，对一类人总先看他的优点，对另一类人先看他的缺点，这样老用“先入为主”的眼光看人，一堵墙就造成了。清华对老教授总是抱着怀疑的态度。他举了这样一个例子：铸工教研组有位青年人订了个学习计划，三年内要解决十二个科学上的重大问题。计划送给苏联专家看了，结果给专家狠狠地批评了一顿，因为每个问题如果解决都能够得上博士论文的水平。我们没有理由去埋怨青年人好高骛远，但是教研组主任是了解情况的，为什么不予过问呢？唯恐一加干涉就会被人们扣上压制新生力量的帽子。钱伟长说，在这样的气氛下，如何叫他们能作好领导工作呢？根据他的说法，清华大多数系和教研组主任没有真正地当家作主，最多也是陷在事务工作里。他还说，建筑系主任梁思成教授这几年来就是挂个空名，从未过问系的教学。而且像这样一位有声望、有才学的教授竟然连一个徒弟也没有，是令人悲哀的。钱伟长猛抽了一口烟问道：不向有经验、专长的老教授学习，向谁学习呢，再不扭转过来，危机就到了。
   “我不赞成蒋校长的说法”
   “蒋南翔校长在光明日报上谈到学校领导体制问题时说大概有五种提法，钱先生的意见呢？”开始，他没有正面回答记者的提问，却率直地说，我不赞成蒋校长的说法：“要注意使大家各得其所，要注意发挥老教授的作用，也要注意培养年青教师”。钱伟长认为这话表面上看起来似乎很全面，实质上这个全面是为片面而服务的。如果把老教授同青年教授搁在同等地位上，即是不尊重老教授的“老把戏”！接着，他离开沙发踱来踱去，反转身来问道：“为什么许多老教授不愿呆在具有悠久历史的学校，而要到科学院去呢？是单纯地为了研究工作么？不，近年来学校里一种寂静穆肃的空气实在使人难受极了”。他举了许多实例说，老教授们认为没有出息的一些人，偏让他进教研室当助教，选拔学生出国、教师提级等重大问题也都没有征求过教授们的一点意见，走的尽是党和行政路线。他说，在苏联，一个教授、教研组主任是受学校和人们莫大的尊敬的。在苏联作教授的可以任意挑选助教作为他的助手，如果教授认为他的助手不够称职，也可立即除名辞掉，学校当局是十分尊重的。
    由此，钱伟长的看法是党的工作要继续加强是不容怀疑的。在全面依靠老教授的前提下，党主要是加强对教授的教育和领导工作。而学术、教学上的重要问题应该由老教授来领导，老教授在某门专业上应该站在权威的地位，助教升讲师、讲师升教授也给老教授以绝对的决定性权力。
   “空气紧张人情薄”
    钱先生越谈越有劲，他对清华大学的内部矛盾问题作了这样的估计：清华的问题是不少，但与其他学校比也没有什么了不起的问题。首先一个客观原因是党的领导较强。另外还有个原因，他意味深长地说，清华也可说是“子弟学校”，师生关系、同学关系多，有时候工作搞不通，还可摆出老师的资格来，或者是同学的资格来，这样也稍能解决一些问题。
    往事，似乎是值得人们留恋的，钱先生说，过去我们这些教授家里总是有川流不息的人来来往往，所以有些问题不用开会就在无形中解决了。现在呢，大家“板板六十四”绷起脸孔来办公事，特别是师徒间的关系不融洽。他激动地说：“你要在学术上帮助他，他却抱着怀疑、批判的态度来学习，甚至还要斗争你，试问这样如何教？又如何学呢？”他又以“三反”和“肃反”为例说，知识分子改造思想是重要的，但是有些青年人光抓人的缺点，甚至一些私生活中的问题也揭开了，这就使老年人损伤了自尊心。以后就谨小慎微，一到开会空气就十分紧张，还把自己和人家的发言统统纪录下来，以便有案可查，防备抓小辫子。
    钱伟长说，一个有专长的教师总是希望把徒弟培育成才的，犹之乎古人所云“望子成龙”。过去他向吴有训（现任中国科学院副院长）老师学习过。近年来，自己也培养出一些很有作为的人才。他说，胡海昌、叶开沅（曾得科学院奖金）的成长不过是四、五年的事，他们学习虚心、积极，我也乐于指导，师生间团结友爱有什么不好呢？听说有人在批判什么“胡海昌路线”，真不知从何说起。他还谈起，校外有七、八个青年人没有通过什么组织关系，“走私”来向他学习，成为他的私淑，他也欣然地接受了。
  　他还谈到，整个教育思想中要求过高是造成学校空气紧张、师生精神负担沉重的原因。目前学校里出现了一种令人惊奇的现象，不止一次发生过学生考试得个“四分”竟然会哭闹的事情。钱伟长说，我们老清华学生功课也不比现在轻松，但学习情绪则是轻松愉快的，有时偶而考试不及格拿个“手枪”也就算了，再从头学起。他认为工作、学习应该是紧张的，但决不可人为地促成精神上的负担。
   “目前学术空气太少了”
    作为一个有几十年教学、科学研究经验的老教授，不可能在一些重大的教学问题上没有他自己的看法，对钱教授来说更其如此。钱伟长说：“目前学术空气太少了。”
    他对“先教学后科研”的提法是有意见的。过去教学质量不高，老是强调教学法、备课等技术性问题，也是不对的。他说，质量的关键问题在于教师通过科学研究在学术水平上的不断提高。说到这里，他去拿了一本剪报给记者看，上面是他在人民日报上几次发表过的意见，但是并未获得领导重视。
    钱伟长还与记者谈到一件不愉快的事情，几个月前他先后在光明日报、人民日报上发表了有关培养目标的文章。不久就听到领导上说他的文章在学生中引起了不良的影响，动摇了大家的学习情绪，说是要组织大伙讨论讨论。他笑着说，名曰“讨论”，其实是要“批判”。领导上认为，他的文章引起了：一、否定了向苏联学习，二、怀疑社会主义教学成果，三、使学生思想混乱等等不良后果。因之，把原来的问题性质转化了。
    钱伟长说，我还是要谈我的看法。我反对大学毕业生就是工程师的提法，大学学习不过是打下个基础，真正的学习是从生产实际中开始的。有些专业知识可以通过生产实践获得的就该精简，以充实基本训练。他说，我的看法也不可能百分之一百是对的，但也可以展开讨论或实验。十多年前，原子能同位素——铀的分离方法共有七种之多，谁也不服谁，结果各走各的道路，大家都获得成功了。所以自然科学不争鸣，是不会发展的。
    他还说，在苏联一个高等学校也有两个名词相同的专业，由两派学者用各自认为最有效的不同方法来培养。所以，他说我们也不必强求机械统一，在专业设置上，甚至各个学校的管理上都可以采取多种方式尝试，也可能都行得通，也可能有的成功，有的失败，这样就可以去芜存精、吸取经验了。
    谈话持续了三个多小时，最后钱伟长向记者表示，中央整风的指示是及时的，过去意见憋得太久太多了，所以不得不用运动方式大规模地搞一下，他希望从这次轰轰烈烈的运动以后，能够转入经常化。具体以清华而言，他认为领导上对放的政策是肯定的，但是现在的状况还不是放得够不够的问题，而是基本上还没有放出来！
