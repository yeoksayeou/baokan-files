    Our newspaper reports that nursery work in factories and mines is developing rapidly. According to statistics from the end of 1956, there were 8,246 nurseries run by enterprise administrations, taking in more than 222,000 children; 281 kindergartens, taking in more than 23,300 children; and 1,774 nursery stations and kindergartens run by employee dormitory residents, taking in more than 91,800 children. In addition, there are various forms of organizations such as children's clubs, children's teams, children's groups, good kid groups, elementary school student study groups, tutoring groups, and summer children's paradises, which provide preschool education and extracurricular tutoring for children.
    These many nurseries and nursery stations have all implemented the principle of "spending less and doing more." The Shanghai Sanmin Canvas Factory used employee dormitory rooms, whitewashed the walls, and added some simple equipment, spending only a little more than one hundred yuan to establish a small nursery. Many nursery stations and kindergartens run by residents started from scratch. For example, the family members of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company staff and workers in the Gonghewei area built five brand new houses by collecting bricks and donating bricks themselves; the Tianjin Hengyuan Yarn Factory had employees give up spare rooms to establish a nursery station. Some children's teams, children's clubs, and other organizations carry out activities in the open spaces around the dormitories, seeking the sun in cold weather and shade in summer, and going to the tutor's home or the family committee office on rainy days.
    Many staff members of nurseries and nursery stations pay great attention to careful calculation and saving expenses. The staff of the Dalian Crane Factory nursery made more than 300 toys themselves in one month, saving more than 180 yuan. The cots in the nursery jointly run by the Shanghai Linkang Socks Factory and the Dazhong Socks Factory are made of old wood. Many nurseries in Shanghai wipe the floors with boiling water used for disinfecting utensils in order to save water. Many nurseries and nursery stations also try to make various foods such as milk cakes, soy milk, and biscuits, which are inexpensive and nutritious, the children like to eat them, and they also reduce food costs.
    In order to improve the professional level of children's work in factories and mines, in 1956, the All-China Women's Federation and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly held two training classes for nursery directors of factory and mine enterprises, and local health departments also carried out various forms of training for childcare workers.
    Many nurseries and nursery stations do their best to meet the needs of the masses and provide great help to employees. For example, the Harbin Local Garment Factory had 33 female workers who had suspended their jobs without pay because their children could not be sent to the nursery. After the staff of the nursery found a way to expand the facilities using waste materials and accommodated these children, these female workers returned to their jobs. They also try to provide convenience to the masses in terms of pick-up times and admission systems. In order to enable female workers to participate in cultural and technical studies with peace of mind, some nurseries have extended the time their children are cared for. The Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant Nursery Station in Changzhou, according to the needs of parents, divides all the children in the station into 14 classes, including full-day classes, half-day classes, and every other day half-day classes. The Shanghai Railway Hongxia Nursery Station helps to pick up and drop off children whose homes have no one to take care of them. Some nurseries and stations have also set up some full-time boarding beds, so that when female workers are on business trips, sick, or male employees' family members are hospitalized and no one is available to take care of the children, the children can be temporarily boarded full-time. The Shanghai State-owned No. 3 Wool Textile Factory Nursery provides temporary full-time care for children when their mothers are working the middle shift or in special circumstances such as wind and rain. After the children of the employees' dormitories of the Zhengzhou State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill are sent to the nursery station, the night shift employees get adequate rest. Jiao Huifang of the cylinder shaking workshop said: "In the past, the children made it difficult to sleep well, and I couldn't complete the plan of watching forty yarn cylinders on the night shift. Since the children entered the nursery station, I can complete the plan of watching eighty yarn cylinders every day. Others say that I have improved, but I say that it is not that I have improved, but that the nursery station has helped me solve my difficulties." (Fan Rong)

    厂矿托儿组织收托了三十多万职工子女
    贯彻少花钱多办事的原则是托儿工作发展很快的重要原因
    本报讯　厂矿企业的托儿工作开展很快。1956年底统计，企业行政举办的托儿所有八千二百四十六处，收托儿童二十二万二千多人，幼儿园二百八十一处，收托儿童二万三千三百多人，职工宿舍家属群众举办的托儿站、幼儿园共有一千七百七十四处，收托儿童九万一千八百多人，此外还有许多儿童会、儿童队、儿童组、好孩子组、小学生自习组、辅导组、暑期儿童乐园等各种各样形式的组织，对儿童进行着学龄前教育和课余活动的辅导。
    这许多托儿所和托儿站都贯彻执行了“少花钱、多办事”的原则。上海三民帆布厂利用职工宿舍的房子，粉刷一下墙壁，添置一些简单的设备，只花一百多元钱便建立了一个小型托儿所。有许多家属群众举办的托儿站、幼儿园更是白手起家。如鞍山市共和卫职工家属自己动手捡砖、献砖，盖起了五间崭新的房子；天津恒源纱厂，职工让出空闲房屋成立了托儿站。有些儿童队，儿童会等组织，都是在宿舍周围的空地上，冷天找太阳，夏天找荫凉，雨天到辅导员的家里或家属委员会办公室去活动。
    许多托儿所、托儿站的工作人员，十分注意精打细算，节约开支。大连起重机厂托儿所的。工作人员在一个月内，自己制作了三百多件玩具，节省了一百八十多元。上海林康袜厂和大中袜厂联合举办的托儿所的小床，是用旧木料作的，上海有许多托儿所为了节约用水，把消毒用具的开水来擦地板。许多托儿所、托儿站还在花钱少、营养价值高的原则下设法自制奶糕、豆浆、饼干等多种多样的食品，孩子们喜欢吃，也降低了伙食费用。
    为了提高厂矿企业儿童工作的业务水平，1956年全国妇联与全国总工会共同举办了两期厂矿企业托儿所所长训练班，各地卫生部门也开展了多种多样方式培训保育人员的工作。
    许多托儿所、托儿站尽力满足群众的需要，给了职工很大的帮助。如哈尔滨地方服装厂曾有三十三名女工因孩子送不进托儿所停薪留职，经过该所工作人员想办法利用废料扩充设备，收容了这些儿童，使这些女工又回到了工作岗位。在收托时间及收托制度上也尽量给群众方便，为了使女工能安心地参加文化，技术学习，有些托儿所延长了孩子受托时间。常州戚墅堰车辆厂托儿站，根据家长的需要，把全站儿童分别编成整日班、半日班、隔日半天班等十四个班。上海铁路红厦托儿站帮助接送家里没人照管的儿童。有些托儿所、站还设立了一部分全托床位，女工出差、生病或男职工家属住院无人照顾孩子，均可把孩子临时全托。上海国营毛纺织三厂托儿所，遇到母亲上中班或刮风下雨等特殊情况时，孩子可得到临时全托。郑州国棉一厂职工宿舍的孩子送入托儿站以后，夜班职工得到充分休息。筒摇车间焦蕙芳说：“过去孩子闹得睡不好觉，上夜班看四十个纱筒还完不成计划，自孩子入托儿站后看八十个纱筒都能按日完成计划，别人说我进步了，我说不是我进步，而是托儿站帮我解决困难啦”。　（范蓉）
