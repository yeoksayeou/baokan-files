    Czechoslovakia’s industrial production has developed rapidly and the agricultural collectivization movement is steadily progressing in the twelve years since its liberation.

    In 1956, Czechoslovakia's industrial production reached 2.7 times the pre-war level. The annual output of major heavy industrial products reached the following scale: coal - 23.4 million tons, electricity generation - 16.6 billion kilowatt-hours, pig iron - 3.3 million tons, steel - 4.9 million tons, steel products - 3.3 million tons. Compared with the pre-war year of 1937, the total electricity generation in 1937 could be reached in just 90 days in 1956; brown coal in 122 days, coal in 219 days, steel products in 172 days, and cement in 148 days. In 1957, Czechoslovak machine manufacturing plants produced the entire year's output of tractors of 1937 in less than four days; the entire year’s output of trucks of 1937 in six hours; the entire year’s output of motorcycles of 1937 in thirty-nine days; the entire year’s output of freight cars of 1937 in seventy-five days; and the entire year’s output of cars of 1937 in half a year.

    A comparison with major capitalist countries further illustrates the rapid development of Czechoslovak industry. From 1937 to 1955, Czechoslovakia's electricity generation increased more than threefold, while France and Italy only increased by a little more than double. From 1948 to 1956, Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing output increased by 320% per capita, while from 1948 to 1955, Belgium's machine manufacturing output increased by only 22%, and the United States by only 59%. The strong industrial base, rapidly changing industrial technology, and such rapid development enable Czechoslovakia today to propose new economic tasks, namely, to strive to catch up with and surpass developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output of major industrial products in the shortest possible time.

    In terms of the agricultural collectivization movement, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives has increased by nearly a quarter in the past two years. In the first four months of this year, 440 new agricultural cooperatives were established. According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, to date, the number of unified agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia has increased to more than 8,450, owning approximately one-third of the country's cultivated land, accounting for 48% together with state-owned farms. Over the past three years, the level of mechanization in socialist agriculture has increased from 88% to 92%. The number of tractors used by agricultural cooperatives has increased by 41%.

    社会主义农业机械化程度已提高到92％
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克解放十二年来，工业获得了迅速的发展，农业合作化运动也在稳步前进。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业生产量1956年已经达到了战前水平的二点七倍，主要重工业产品的年产量达到了这样的规模：煤——二千三百四十万吨，发电量——一百六十六亿度，生铁——三百三十万吨，钢——四百九十万吨，钢材——三百三十万吨。如果同战前1937年比较，1937年全年的总发电量在1956年只要九十天就达到了，褐煤只要一百二十二天，煤只要二百十九天，钢材只要一百七十二天，水泥只要一百四十八天。1957年，捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造厂在不到四天的时间内就生产了1937年全年生产的拖拉机；在六小时内生产了1937年全年的载重汽车；在三十九天内生产了1937年全年的摩托车；在七十五天内生产了1937年全年的运货车厢；在半年内生产了1937年全年的小汽车。
    假如同主要的资本主义国家比较，更可以清楚地看出捷克斯洛伐克工业发展的迅速。从1937—1955年，捷克斯洛伐克的发电量增加了三倍多，而法国和意大利只增加了一倍多一点。从1948年到1956年，捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造业产量按人口计算增加了320％，而从1948年到1955年，比利时的机器制造业产量只增加22％，美国也只增加59％。雄厚的工业基础，日新月异的工业技术，和这样快的发展速度，使捷克斯洛伐克今天有可能提出新的经济任务，即争取在最短期间内，在按人口平均计算的主要工业产量方面赶上并超过发达的资本主义国家。
    在农业合作化运动方面，过去两年，农业生产合作社的数目几乎增加了四分之一，今年头四个月，新成立的农业社就有四百四十个。据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，到目前为止，捷克斯洛伐克全国的统一农业合作社已增加到八千四百五十多个，它们拥有的耕地约占全国耕地的三分之一左右，连同国营农场在内共占48％。过去三年来，社会主义农业的耕作机械化程度已从88％提高到92％。农业社使用的拖拉机增加了41％。
