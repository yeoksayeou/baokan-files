Hypocrite	Li Budiao

In London, the British Information Service has a Mr. Guy Wint. The British official propaganda organ publishes commentaries on China issues, all signed by this gentleman. This gentleman, posing as a "China expert," has for years been trying to prove to Asia, through his bombastic and malicious articles, that China's socialist construction cannot be completed and that China does not want peaceful coexistence. Facts have already given the best answer to these articles, and we can ignore them.

However, Mr. Wint's recent masterpiece, entitled "Incitement to the Middle East," has aroused people's interest.

Mr. Wint probably slept soundly through the Suez Canal crisis, and now, waking up, he suddenly sees the situation in the Middle East as "perilous." Relying on his "China expert" instinct, he immediately discovered that this situation is "made more dangerous by China's meddling."

Someone with a little geographical knowledge might be worried for Mr. Wint, wondering where he could even start his article. However, Mr. Wint is indeed an "old hand." Look how well he can find suspicious "clues" and write articles based on them, warning Arab countries to be wary of China's "political aims."

The "clues" that Mr. Wint found are three: first, various professional groups between China and Arab countries are conducting mutual visits and exchanges; second, China has developed trade relations with some Arab countries; and third, Chinese Muslims have had contact with Muslims in Arab countries.

Just these? Just these! For Mr. Wint, one is enough to constitute the crime of China's "meddling" in the Middle East, let alone the fact that he actually found three.

It is not necessary to waste much ink on these three ridiculous "charges" made by Mr. Wint. However, it would probably be appropriate to provide Mr. Wint with a genuine piece of evidence of China's "meddling" in the Middle East. This evidence is that the Chinese people have resolutely supported the Egyptian people in their struggle against British aggression against Egypt, and are still resolutely supporting the Arab people in their struggle against colonialism. How could Mr. Wint have forgotten this? We can only hope that he did not forget it on purpose.

Starting from the very generous assumption that Mr. Wint's memory is too poor, in addition to reminding Mr. Wint that an event of aggression against Egypt occurred in the Middle East, it is also necessary to remind him that the situation in the Middle East is indeed "perilous" for Britain, and that it is not due to China's "meddling," but is "made more dangerous" by the meddling of Britain's "ally," the United States. Mr. Wint's failure to aim his pen at the United States, which is sweeping away British interests in the Middle East, but instead aiming it at China, which has no interests to speak of in the Middle East, is, in any case, an act lacking gentlemanly demeanor.

Needless to say, Mr. Wint's article is written for the Arab people as a friend. However, the Arab people have already seen this British "friend" who likes to use planes and cannons to attack friends. Even if Mr. Wint did not deliberately forget the kind of "friendship" that Britain has shown to the Arab people, the Arab people will not forget it. They know what Mr. Wint's "concern" for the Arab people in this article is for.

Of course, we have no intention of blaming Mr. Wint; he may just be carrying out orders to write "Far East reviews." However, the hypocritical attitude expressed in this article is a very typical thing.

    伪君子	李不雕
    伦敦的英国新闻处有一位盖·温特先生。这个英国官方宣传机关发表的有关中国问题的评论，都是由这位先生署名的。这位先生摆着一副“中国通”的面孔，几年来一直用他大言不惭、充满恶意的文章，企图向亚洲证明中国的社会主义建设是完成不了的，证明中国是不要和平共处的。对于这些文章，事实已经作了最好的答复，我们可以不去管它。
    不过，温特先生最近的一篇题目叫做“对中东的煽动”的杰作，却引起了人们的兴趣。
    温特先生在苏伊士运河危机时期大概睡了大觉，现在一觉醒来，忽然看到中东的局势“岌岌可危”，并且凭着他那种“中国通”的本能，立刻发现这种局势“正由于中国的插足其间而更形险恶”。
    有点地理知识的人也许要替温特先生捏一把汗，不知道他的文章能从哪里做起。可是，温特先生不愧是个“老手”，你看他多么会找可疑的“蛛丝马迹”，并且根据它们而写出了文章，向阿拉伯国家提出了当心中国的“政治上的目的”的警告。
    温特先生找到的“蛛丝马迹”有三样，一是中国和阿拉伯国家之间的各种职业团体之间在互相进行访问和交流，二是中国同一些阿拉伯国家发展了贸易关系，三是中国的穆斯林同阿拉伯国家的穆斯林有了接触。
    就是这么一些吗？就是这么一些！而对于温特先生来说，要构成中国“插足”中东的罪状，有一样就够了，何况他居然找到了三样。
    对于温特先生提出的这三种可笑的“罪状”，可以不必去多费笔墨。不过，向温特先生提供一个中国“插足”中东的真实材料，大概是应该的。这个材料就是：中国人民曾经坚决支持埃及人民反对英国侵略埃及的斗争，并且现在还在坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义的斗争。温特先生怎么偏偏忘记了这件事情呢？我们只能希望，他不是故意忘记的。
    从温特先生的记忆力太差这样一个十分宽宏大量的假定出发，除了已经提醒温特先生在中东发生过侵略埃及的事件以外，还需要提醒他：中东局势对英国来说，的确“岌岌可危”，而且，并不是由于中国“插足”其间，而是由于英国的“盟友”美国插足其间而“更形险恶”了。温特先生不把他的笔去对着正在中东扫荡英国利益的美国，却来对着在中东毫无利益可言的中国，这无论如何也是有失绅士风度的行为。
    温特先生的文章，用不着说，是以阿拉伯人民的朋友的身份写给他们看的。不过，喜欢用飞机大炮去进攻朋友的这位英国“朋友”，阿拉伯人民已经见识过了。纵使温特先生并非故意地忘记了英国对阿拉伯人民表示过的这种“友谊”，阿拉伯人民却不会忘记。他们知道温特先生这篇文章里对阿拉伯人民的“关心”是为了什么。
    当然，我们无意指责温特先生，他可能只是照例奉命撰写“远东评论”而已。不过，这篇文章所表达出来的这种伪君子的态度，倒是一种很典型的东西。
