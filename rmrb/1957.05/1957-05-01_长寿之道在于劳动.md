    Longevity Lies in Labor
    Soviet Meritorious Scientist Sarkisov-Serazini, who has long studied longevity, said that physical labor plays a decisive role in prolonging life. It is the most important factor in maintaining youthfulness.

    He said that labor created mankind, and it is inseparable from human life, and it is the support of the elderly. Many people believe that the elderly should move less, thinking that labor is harmful to the body. This view is completely wrong.

    The meritorious scientist also said that people who completely stop all labor in their old age often suddenly become weak and sick, and die quickly. Therefore, it is best for the elderly to maintain some light labor or some personal hobbies, such as cultivating flowers and plants or doing gymnastics.

    He also said that alcohol and nicotine are extremely harmful to the human body.

    长寿之道在于劳动
    长期研究长寿问题的苏联功勋科学家萨尔基佐夫—塞拉齐尼说，体力劳动在延长寿命方面起着决定性的作用。它是保持人体具有青春活力的最重要的因素。
    他说，劳动创造了人类，它和人类的生命是不可分割的，它是老年人的支持力量。许多人认为，老年人应该少走动，认为劳动对有机体是有害的。这种看法是大错特错的。
    这位功勋科学家还说，凡是在老年的时候完全停止一切劳动的人往往会突然变得虚弱多病，很快就会死去。因此，老年人最好是能保持作一些比较轻松的劳动或是某种个人特别癖好的活动，如栽培花草或是作体操等。
    他还说，酒精和尼古丁对人体有极大的损害。
