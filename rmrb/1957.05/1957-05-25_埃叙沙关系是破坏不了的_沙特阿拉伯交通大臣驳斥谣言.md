Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 24th: Saudi Arabian Minister of Transport Sultan bin Abdul Aziz told reporters from the Middle East News Agency on May 23rd that rumors spread by certain parties regarding the relations between Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria are purely fabricated. He said that no means can undermine the relations between these three countries.

Aziz came to Cairo last week on official business and has since been in contact with senior Egyptian authorities.

He said that the enemies of Arab nationalism are conducting large-scale activities to create discord among the liberated Arab countries, making it seem as if they have differences of opinion.

Aziz denied reports that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon would conclude a treaty, and that Saudi Arabia would join the Baghdad Pact.

    埃叙沙关系是破坏不了的
    沙特阿拉伯交通大臣驳斥谣言
    据新华社开罗24日电　沙特阿拉伯交通大臣苏丹·本·阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹5月23日对中东通讯社记者说，某方面散播的关于沙特阿拉伯、埃及和叙利亚之间的关系的谣言纯粹是捏造的。他说，任何手段都不能破坏这三个国家之间的关系。
    阿齐兹是在上星期因公前来开罗的，随后他一直在同埃及的高级当局进行接触。
    他说，阿拉伯民族主义的敌人正在进行大规模活动，在获得解放的阿拉伯国家之间制造不和，使它们显得好像是意见分歧似的。
    阿齐兹否认了关于沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、约旦和黎巴嫩要缔结一项条约以及沙特阿拉伯将参加巴格达条约的消息。
