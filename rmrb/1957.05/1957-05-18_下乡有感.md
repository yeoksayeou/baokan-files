Reflections on Going to the Countryside	Liu Baiyu

Recently, I lived in the countryside for a short time. Although the time was short, two impressions were particularly clear.

From Beijing to the provincial capital, I felt that the living conditions were a bit different. When I left the railway line for the county town, I took a truck. From the county town to the countryside, I took a horse-drawn cart. When traveling between villages, the best means of transportation was a bicycle. If the previous modes of transport relied on the vehicle pulling me, in the end, I had to "rely on my own efforts." Of course, I am not just talking about transportation, but also the surrounding material conditions that naturally changed along with it. If we look at this change in reverse, when we return, we find the third-class carriage quite comfortable, and riding in a car in the provincial capital is a bit uneasy. I think this up-and-down comparison is like the up-and-down lines on a graph, illustrating how much distance has developed between people like us (I am not referring to ordinary workers, citizens, and ordinary cadres in the city) and the people. Thinking carefully about this, isn't this problem serious? This time, I went to an old revolutionary base area where the enemy's mopping-up operations were most brutal during the Anti-Japanese War. I rode my bicycle to a village to visit an old Party member, who sharply criticized our current cadres for being divorced from the masses. I know that this old farmer, during the war, gritted his teeth and sacrificed the life of his own son; I know that this old farmer, last winter, trudged thirty *li* to the county Party committee, only to be coldly treated by a person in the reception room who asked him, "What are you doing here?!" He said, "I'm here to see my home." However, they are still closely connected with the masses, so they can keenly see the bureaucracy of our current cadres who are divorced from the masses. I sat in front of him, silent for a long time. I thought of the past, when we lived and struggled with the people every day, sharing weal and woe, and sharing our fate. On snowy days, when we arrived at the campsite, didn't they give us their little heated *kang* to sleep on, and save us a bite of their own grain to cook? Of course, I am by no means saying that we should not build cities and prosper our lives, and that everyone should abandon material civilization and move back to the mountains. But I think the problem is that some of us are gradually becoming spiritually alienated from the people. We live in tall cities, some agencies are getting bigger and bigger, more and more cadres are gathering, qualifications are getting older and older, and levels are getting higher and higher. As a result, houses chase after personnel increases, and cars rush after level increases. Over time, some people even openly regard competing for levels and demanding treatment as reasonable phenomena, and are not ashamed to say so. But I don’t know, if we don’t closely connect with the masses and just keep going up like this, it’s really worrying. It’s like flying a kite, only letting it go and not reeling it in. One day, the string will break and it will fly to the clouds. The people still welcome us, love us, and respect us, and are happy that we come to their villages. Because the people still remember how the Party led them through the storms of history, how they stepped onto the broad road and moved towards a brand-new socialist society, and improved the lives of the vast number of poor farmers. They also remember how we used to walk with them on that difficult road. In this respect, the people's affection for us is deep. But at the same time, the people are also watching us, examining us, criticizing us, urging us, and this is also a severe reality. I think how good it would be if we could shorten that up-and-down distance, let us restore our original traditions, go deep among the people, become familiar with the people's pulse and breath, and be as free and comfortable as "ducks know when the spring river warms."

Another impression is that the broad masses of the people are advancing very quickly. If the previous paragraph talked about the contrast between the upper and lower levels, now let's talk about the contrast between the past and the present. Some people with some education, regardless of their class origin, always feel that the people are backward and they are clever. But after the people achieved a great victory, in the past few years, the Party led the socialist upsurge in the countryside, which caused fundamental and huge changes among the farmers. This change is from individual to collective. Take a look, this step is really big, this step has overturned thousands of years of history and changed the entire social relationship. This trip to the countryside coincided with the busiest time of spring wheat management. People go to the fields during the day, but gather in the "livestock sheds" of various production teams at night (the houses where the production team raises livestock, naturally forming public places where the team members gather, and the loudspeakers are also installed in this place). Think about what is the meaning of the change from the old rural livestock shed full of sorrow and poverty to today's brand-new "livestock shed"? And how lively, free, harmonious and happy are their night meetings! After dinner, people arrive one after another, first listening to their favorite news broadcasts, and then the women come, and then it gets lively: "You men are all sitting on the *kang*!?" Everyone laughs, so the younger ones give up their places on the *kang*. Regarding the ongoing work and how the work points should be evaluated, a young work point recorder first raised the issue, and the discussion began. When the male team members spoke enthusiastically, several women gathered to discuss. After a while, the women spoke, criticizing the male team members for underestimating the work points for hoeing wheat assigned to the female team members, and a dispute occurred. Finally, the old farmers gently said a few fair words, and the work points for hoeing wheat were fairly increased by half. The male team members laughed and said, "The work points are set, but you can't be careless!" The female team members replied: "You can check!" Think about it, how can this be compared to the kind of dull meeting we often have? Are the people not smarter than us in some ways? Can you say that they will not enjoy democratic life in collective life? People may ask: Are you talking about an advanced cooperative! You must know that there are still shortcomings and darkness in the countryside, and didn't you say earlier that there is bureaucracy? That's right, there is, but the mainstream is a vigorous and irresistible vigor. I also visited the most backward "white spot" village in this county. Even here, life is quite difficult, but what people are planning from the bottom of their hearts is how to actively catch up and improve production, instead of a scene of dejection. In short, the progress of the vast number of farmers in the socialist upsurge is rapid and inspiring. But when I ask myself, how are we compared to this kind of vigor? After entering the city, are we completely unpolluted, with our eyes open, walking in the front? The Party is always leading the way, the Central Committee is like this, and most comrades are like this. But if we are divorced from the masses, complacent with the enjoyment of life, carrying burdens, and putting on airs, I dare not say that we are advancing quickly, and in contrast, we appear slow, stagnant, and even backward. At least we are not taking steps as open and large as the people. In this way, we must be careful that the people who are striding forward will one day look back and laugh at you.

Finally, sticking to my profession, on the way back from the countryside, I kept thinking: What is the situation in our literature? We often say: Literature cannot meet the needs of the people, and literature has failed to deeply reflect the changes in people's lives. Isn't this contradiction also a reflection of being divorced from the masses and lagging behind the masses? Now is the time to solve this problem. The new era has put forward new tasks, facing social changes that have not occurred in thousands of years, and a broad road of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is unfolding before us. The sunshine is shining in our lives, and fresh air is rushing into our lungs. This is a good time for us to closely integrate with the people and move forward together.

    下乡有感	刘白羽
    最近到乡下去住了短短的一个时间，时间虽短，有两点印象却特别鲜明。
    从北京到了省会，就觉得生活条件有点不一样了，等到离开铁路线到县城去，坐的是卡车，由县城到农村去坐的是大车，等到在农村之间来往，最好的代步工具就是自行车了，如果说前面的几种都是靠车拉着自己，最后却是不得不“自食其力”了。在这儿讲的当然不只是交通工具，就是周围的一切物质条件自然也都跟随着发生了变化。把这变化再倒过来看一下呢？等到往回走，坐上三等车厢便觉得太舒适了，到省会坐上小汽车已经有些忐忑不安起来。我觉得这一上一下的对比，正像指标图上一上一下的线条，说明现在像我们这样的人（我指的当然不是城市里一般的工人、市民和普通干部）和人民之间发生了多么悬殊的距离。仔细思索一下，这问题是不是不严重呢？这次去的是抗日战争时期敌人扫荡最残酷的老根据地。我骑着自行车到一个村里，去拜访了一个老党员，他深刻地批评了我们现在的干部脱离群众。我知道，就是这个老农民，在战争时，咬咬牙，付出了自己亲生儿子的生命；我知道，就是这个老农民，去冬，跋踄三十里到县党委会去，被一个收发室的人冷待，问他：“干什么的！？”他说：“我是来看看我的家的。”可是，他们到现在紧密地联系着群众，因此他们能敏锐地看出我们现在干部脱离群众的官僚主义。我坐在他面前，很久没作声。我想到从前，我们不是天天同人民在一道生活，一道斗争，共甘苦、共命运吗？大风雪的日子，到了宿营地，不是他们把自己的一点热炕头腾给我们睡觉，把自己的一口粮食省给我们煮饭吗？当然，我绝不是说我们现在不应当建设城市，繁荣生活，要大家都摒弃物质文明，都搬回山沟里去。但是我觉得问题是我们中间一些人，从精神上离人民渐渐疏远了。我们住在高高的大城市里，有些机关愈闹愈大，干部愈聚愈多，资格愈来愈老，级别愈来愈高，于是房子追着人员上涨，小汽车赶着级别飞奔，久而久之，甚至在一部分人头脑里公然把争级别，闹待遇都当成合理现象，而不耻于出口了。但不知道，如果不密切联系群众，一味这样向上升，真令人担心，像放风筝，只放不收，有一天终会断了线，飞到九霄云外去。人民现在还欢迎我们，热爱我们，尊重我们，因我们到他们乡村里来而高兴。因为人民还记得党怎样领导他们穿过历史的风暴、怎样迈入康庄大道，向崭新的社会主义社会前进，提高了广大贫苦农民的生活。他们也还记得我们这些人曾经怎样跟他们一道走过那患难的道路。在这一点上，人民对我们的情谊是深的。但是同时人民也在拿眼睛望着我们，考察着我们，在批评我们，要求我们，督促我们，这也是严峻的现实。我觉得如果缩短那一上一下的距离，让我们恢复我们身上原有的传统，深入人民中间，熟悉人民的脉搏呼吸，真正像“春江水暖鸭先知”那样自如自在，该多么好。
    另外一点印象，就是广大人民前进得很快。如果前边一段说的是上与下的对比，现在再来讲讲前与后的对比。有了些文化的人，不管自己出身阶级怎样，却总觉得人民落后，自己高明。可是在人民取得了伟大胜利之后，这几年，党领导了农村社会主义高潮，就在农民中间引起根本的、巨大的变化。这变化就是由个体走向集体。你去看一看，这一步跨得可真大，这一步踏翻了几千年历史，改变了整个社会关系。这回下乡正赶上春麦管理最忙时期，人们白天都下地，夜间却聚集到各个生产队的“牲口棚”（生产队养牲口的屋子，自然地形成队员们集聚的公共场所，广播喇叭筒也就安装在这地方）。你想想从那充满忧伤、贫困的古老农村牲口棚到今天这崭新的“牲口棚”之间的变化是什么意思？而且他们的夜会进行得又多么活泼自由，和谐愉快啊！晚饭后，人们陆续到来，先听了一阵他们最爱听的新闻广播，而后，妇女们来了，于是乎热闹起来：“你们老爷们都坐在炕头上了！？”大家笑起来，于是年青些的从炕上让了地盘。关于目前正在进行的几项劳作、工分应该怎么评的问题，先由一个青年记工员提了出来，讨论便开始了。男队员热烈发言时，几个妇女聚到一处去商议。一会，妇女发言了，批评了男队员对分给女队员耪麦子的活儿评分过低，于是发生了争论。最后，老农们轻轻地说了几句公正的话，耪麦地的工分公允地提高了一半。男队员们哈哈笑起来说：“工分定了，你们可不能粗枝大叶呀！”女队员答话：“你们检查吧！”你想想看，这岂是我们常开的那种沉闷的会议所能比？人民那一点不比我们聪明，你能说他们不会在集体生活中享受着民主生活吗？人们也许要问：你讲的这是先进的社呀！你要知道农村中还有缺点，还有黑暗，你前面不也说过有官僚主义吗？不错，是有，但主流却是一派蓬蓬勃勃，锐不可当的朝气。我也曾访问过这一县最落后的一个“白点”村，就是在这里，生活相当困难，但人们从心缝里打算的也是怎样积极赶上去，闹好生产，而不是一片垂头丧气景象。总之，广大农民在社会主义高潮中的前进是快的，是令人振奋的。但扪心自问，如果拿这种锐气来对照一下我们又怎样呢？进城之后，是否全然一尘不染，两眼睁明，走在前面呢？党是永远带着头走在前面的，中央是这样，多数同志也是这样。但如果脱离群众，安于生活享受，背着包袱，扛着架子，我不敢说前进得快，而且相形之下，却显得迟缓、停滞、以致落后。起码也是没有人民那一步跨得开、迈得大。这样就得当心脚步奔放的人民，有一天，会回过头来笑你。
    最后，三句话不离本行，从乡下回来，我一路上想着：我们文学方面的情况怎样呢？我们常常说：文学不能适应人民的需要，文学未能深刻地反映人民生活的变化，这个矛盾，不也是脱离群众，落后于群众的一种反映吗？现在到了解决这个问题的时候了。新时代提出了新任务，面临着几千年未有的社会大变革，眼前展开了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的广阔道路，阳光照临在我们生活之中，清新的空气冲进我们的肺腑，这正是我们和人民紧密结合、一同前进的好时候。
