Xinhua News Agency, May 28th. Wheat in the major wheat-producing areas across the country is now flowering and heading, with some areas turning yellow and ripening, and beginning to be harvested; wheat in the earlier seasons of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Yunnan provinces has already been harvested.

The more than 200 million mu of wheat in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces, which account for a large proportion of the country's wheat production, are mostly growing well. It is understood that the yield per mu of more than 60 million mu of wheat in Shandong Province can reach 125 jin, and the production increase plan is expected to be realized. More than 50 million mu of wheat in Jiangsu Province is growing vigorously, and if the weather is normal in the future, there is also confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. More than 90% of the 38 million mu of wheat in Hebei Province is growing well, and it is estimated that most areas can achieve their original production plans. The Huaibei Plain in Anhui also presents a scene of bumper harvest, with more than 30 million mu of barley and wheat already filling, and broad beans and pea pods laden with flowers.

The wheat in Sichuan and Hubei provinces is also good this year. It is a foregone conclusion that the 20 million mu of wheat and rapeseed in Sichuan Province will increase production compared to last year. It is estimated that wheat production in Hubei Province can increase by about 10% compared to last year. More than 10 million mu of winter wheat in Gansu Province has also begun to mature, and a bumper harvest is also expected if there are no unexpected disasters.

In addition, the wheat in the Qin Chuan area of Shaanxi is slightly worse than last year. Wheat production in Zhejiang Province will be reduced by about 13% compared to last year due to continuous rain and insufficient sunshine during the flowering and fruiting period. Wheat in Fujian, Yunnan and other provinces has long been harvested, and although the output has also increased, it has not completed this year's production plan.

Last year, the wheat sowing work in various places was done relatively roughly. However, since the beginning of spring this year, farmers in various places have put in a lot of labor to strive for a bumper wheat harvest. The wheat in many areas has generally been hoed and harrowed once to three times, and in many areas, the amount and area of fertilizer applied to wheat fields has exceeded last year. During the period when ice and snow melted and wheat seedlings developed, many agricultural cooperatives strengthened field inspections and processing and cultivation work. In areas that were hit by cold waves and frost in early April, millions of farmers carried out large-scale smoke prevention work, effectively avoiding or reducing the disasters of frost.

Now, agricultural cooperatives in major wheat-producing provinces and regions are actively organizing labor and preparing agricultural tools to welcome the wheat harvest.

### 产麦区小麦丰收有望

    产麦区小麦丰收有望
    新华社28日讯　全国各主要产麦地区的小麦目前都已经扬花抽穗，部分已转黄熟，开始收割；季节较早的广东、广西、福建和云南等省的小麦已经收割完毕。
    占全国小麦生产比重很大的河南、山东、安徽、江苏、河北五省的两亿多亩小麦，大部都长得较好。据了解，山东省六千多万亩小麦每亩产量可以达到一百二十五斤，增产计划可望实现。江苏省五千多万亩小麦生长得比较旺盛，如果往后天气正常，也有把握争取丰收。河北省三千八百多万亩小麦有90％以上都长得较好，估计大部分地区可以实现原来的生产计划。安徽淮北平原也呈现丰收景象，三千多万亩大麦、小麦都已经灌浆，蚕豆、豌豆花夹累累。
    四川、湖北等省的小麦今年也不错。四川省两千万亩小麦、油菜比去年增产已成定局。湖北省的小麦预计可以比去年增产一成左右。甘肃省一千多万亩冬小麦也开始成熟，如果没有意外灾害，也可望丰收。
    此外，陕西秦川地区小麦比去年略差些。浙江省小麦由于在开花结实期间阴雨连绵，日照不足，将比去年减产13％左右。福建、云南等省的小麦早就收了，产量虽然也都有增加，但是却没有完成今年的生产计划。
    去年各地小麦播种工作做得比较粗糙。但是，今年开春以后，各地农民为争取小麦丰收付出了很大的劳动。许多地区的小麦一般都锄、耙了一遍到三遍，有不少地区麦地追肥的施肥量和面积都超过了去年。在冰雪解冻、麦苗发育时节，许多农业社都加强了田间检查和加工培育工作。在四月上旬受到寒潮袭击和出现霜冻的地区，成百万农民展开了大规模的熏烟防冻工作，有效地避免或者减少了霜冻的灾害。
    现在，各主要产麦省区的农业社正在积极组织劳动力和准备农具，迎接麦收。
