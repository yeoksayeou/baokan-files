Symposium on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People"
Beijing Medical Experts Raise Some Sharp Questions

This newspaper reports that on the 5th, at an expanded meeting of the Standing Council of the Chinese Medical Association, more than 20 medical experts from various disciplines in Beijing discussed the issue of "correctly handling contradictions among the people" in light of the actual work of the Medical Association.

Several experts pointed out that academic research work in the Beijing medical community was not as active as in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places because some experts were burdened with too much other work. Hu ChuanKui, Dean of Beijing Medical College, said that some work should leverage the strength of young people, or adopt methods such as division of labor and rotation to solve the time problem. Zhou Zezhao, Director of Beijing Hospital, also suggested that experts should be given more time to engage in academic work.

Jin Baoshan, Director of the Department of Public Health at Beijing Medical College, said that medical scientists should carry out work in conjunction with the needs of workers and peasants. In the past, academic symposiums on hypertension and diabetes had been organized, but he believed that these diseases were not the most important diseases in China today.

When talking about the issue of traditional Chinese medicine, Jin Baoshan said that there are definitely many essences in the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. Today, we should study and learn it as a cultural heritage, and we cannot accept it as modern medical science, and we cannot say that efficacy is science. He said that the Ministry of Health had stated that the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating epidemic encephalitis B was over 90%, and this conclusion was a bit premature. Jin Baoshan and Huang Zhuzhai, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, both suggested that Chinese and Western medicine should learn from each other.

Several experts mentioned the Ministry of Health's procrastination and bureaucracy. Hu ChuanKui said that the number of beds in the affiliated hospital, the clinical teaching base of the medical college, was small and insufficient. He had repeatedly approached the Ministry of Health to request a solution, but the Ministry of Health had been procrastinating, which affected the quality of student learning. Wang Shaoxun, Director of the Department of Radiology at the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Hospital Branch, said that opinions on the health care of radiology personnel had also been raised many times. The Chinese Medical Association forwarded them to the Ministry of Health, but the Ministry of Health ignored them. Jin Baoshan suggested that medical science experts should participate in the work of the Ministry of Health so that problems can be solved meticulously and in-depth, and that experts should not only be asked to attend meetings when there are problems.

The experts also pointed out that the Chinese Medical Association's guidelines and tasks were not clear enough, and it did not put its main strength on academic work. In the future, it should take academic activities as its central work to promote national medical scientific research. Zhang Xiaoqian, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at the China Union Medical College, said that the quality of medical work in the country is currently very low, and there is no unified medical system. The Chinese Medical Association should establish a hospital management society to strengthen research in this area.

The meeting was chaired by Fu Lianzhang, President of the Chinese Medical Association. At the end of the discussion, he said that such discussions should continue to be held.

### 座谈“正确地处理人民内部矛盾”  北京医学家提出了一些尖锐的问题

    座谈“正确地处理人民内部矛盾”
    北京医学家提出了一些尖锐的问题
    本报讯　5日，在中华医学会常务理事扩大会议上，北京的二十多位各科医学专家结合医学会的实际工作讨论了“正确地处理人民内部矛盾”的问题。
    有几位专家提出北京医学界学术研究工作不如上海、天津等地活跃，是因为有些专家担负其他工作过多。北京医学院院长胡传揆说，有些工作要发挥青年人的力量，或采取分工、轮流等办法解决时间问题。北京医院院长周泽昭也提出应多给专家时间从事学术工作。
    北京医学院公共卫生系主任金宝善说，医学科学工作者应结合工人、农民的需要开展工作。过去组织过关于高血压病、糖尿病的学术座谈，他认为这些病并不是我国当前最重要的疾病。
    金宝善在谈到中医问题的时候说，祖国医学遗产中肯定地有许多精华，今天我们应把它作为文化遗产来研究、学习，不能作为现代医学科学来接受，不能讲有疗效就是科学。他说，卫生部提出过中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的疗效在90％以上，这个定论太早了些。金宝善和中医研究院中医师黄竹斋都提出中西医应互相学习。
    有几位专家都提到了卫生部的拖拉作风和官僚主义。胡传揆说，医学院临床教学基地——附属医院的床位少，不够用。他曾多次找卫生部要求解决，卫生部一直拖延，这就影响了学生学习质量。北京中苏友谊医院分院放射科主任汪绍训说，关于放射人员的保健问题也曾提出多次意见。由中华医学会转给卫生部，卫生部却置之不理。金宝善提出医学科学专家应参加卫生部工作，这样解决问题才能细致、深入，不要只是有问题才找专家开开会。
    专家们还提出中华医学会的方针任务不够明确，没有把主要力量放在学术工作上，今后应以学术活动作为中心工作，推动全国医学科学研究工作。中国协和医学院内科学系主任张孝骞说，目前全国医疗工作质量很低，没有统一的医疗制度。中华医学会应设医院管理学会，加强这方面的研究工作。
    这个会是由中华医学会会长傅连暲主持的，他在讨论会结束时说，还要继续召开这类讨论会。
