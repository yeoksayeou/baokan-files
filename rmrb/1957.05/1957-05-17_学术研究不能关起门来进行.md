Since the Party put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," a preliminary breakthrough has been made in the past stagnant situation in literature, art, and academic research, and a lively new atmosphere has emerged. However, although it is now May, the spring chill is still heavy. It should be a time of warm spring and blooming flowers, but the hundred flowers have not yet fully bloomed. The academic community has not yet seen the grand occasion of a hundred schools of thought contending, and the publishing industry still suffers from frost. What exactly is hindering "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend"?

In my opinion, the main reason why the grand occasion of a hundred schools of thought contending has not yet appeared in academic research is that sectarianism is obstructing it; its harmfulness sometimes even exceeds that of dogmatism.

It is true that in academic research, there have recently been some scenes of debate, such as the periodization of slave society and feudal society in Chinese history, the issue of the sprouts of capitalist factors; the issue of old and new poetry in literature, the issue of understanding socialist realism, the issue of the study and analysis of characters' thoughts in "Dream of the Red Chamber," the issue of the evaluation of Li Houzhu's lyrics; the issue of the basic economic laws of the transition period in economics; the issue of the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in philosophy... However, on the whole, our academic debates are still far from sufficient. Some debates have begun, but conclusions are drawn prematurely; some newspapers have organized debates, but ended them prematurely, with authoritative figures speaking and the matter being hastily concluded.

In the field of historical science, the sectarian style is particularly serious. Let's take the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example to illustrate this problem.

Originally, academic research cannot be conducted behind closed doors; and the collection of historical materials must especially follow the mass line, give play to everyone's enthusiasm, and unite all forces that can be united. However, the Third Institute of the Institute of History has been conducting research behind closed doors for the past few years. Not only is it unwilling to actively unite with people across the country who are engaged in historical research, and unwilling to actively and enthusiastically collect valuable historical materials scattered throughout the country, but it also rejects those who take the initiative to submit articles and make contact. In the winter of 1951, I went to Woyang County in Anhui Province to participate in two land reforms, and went to the north bank of the Wo River to visit Zhang Lehang's hometown—the Zhang Lao family—the leader of the Nian Army. I conducted an in-depth investigation and study of some of the deeds of Zhang Lehang and Zhang Zongyu, collected family documents preserved by Zhang's descendants, visited Zhang Gengcai, the great-great-grandson of Zhang Lehang, and investigated the two ancestral tombs of the Zhang family and the tombs of Zhang Weizu and Zhang Zhuo's cenotaph. Afterwards, based on the on-site investigation, I wrote an "Investigation Record of the Deeds of Zhang Lehang, Leader of the Nian Army." At that time, Mr. Luo Ergang was compiling historical materials on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Nanjing. Because the Nian Army uprising was related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, I took it to him for advice. After reading it, he believed that the investigation was very thorough and detailed, and there were many materials that had never been recorded before, which were worth publishing, and suggested submitting it to the "Historical Research" sponsored by the Institute of History. I hesitated at the time, thinking that I had no connection with "Historical Research" and that it might not be published after submission. Mr. Luo was very enthusiastic and suggested that Wang Kefeng, a comrade from the Third Institute of History stationed in Nanjing to sort out archives, introduce the manuscript. Comrade Wang read it and thought it should be published, so he sent it to "Historical Research" on my behalf. After four or five months, the original manuscript was returned without any criticism, but a few words were lightly written:

"The submission does not conform to the style of this journal, and the original manuscript is returned."

I submitted it to "Historical Teaching" again; "Historical Teaching" replied: "We have received your opinions on Nian Army leaders Zhang Lehang and Zhang Zhuo. Our journal plans to make some deletions, and if you agree, we plan to find a way to publish it." I had to agree. A portion of the article was shortened and published in "Historical Teaching." Afterwards, I received several letters from readers forwarded by the journal, expressing great interest in the article and requesting more introduction to the deeds of Zhang Lehang and Zhang Zhuo. Finally, I published another article on the Nian Army in the historical science supplement of Guangming Daily, supplementing some materials. However, the full text of the "Investigation Record" has not been fully published to this day.

An interesting contrast to this is that I recently received a letter from the Third Institute of History, which read: "In order to provide researchers with reference, we plan to select and print various journals of the Tongmenghui system. It has now been decided to reprint the entire 'Min Bao' in full, and it is being filmed. However, the bottom covers and advertising pages of issues 25 and 26 are missing, and we have not been able to borrow them anywhere. It is said that you have a full copy of 'Min Bao' in your collection. We wonder if you can provide the missing pages. In addition, 'Min Bao' is attached with a 'Tian Tao Supplement' and a sheet of issue 3 extra. We have now found them all. Is there any other supplement or extra issue?" This letter powerfully proves that the collection of materials cannot be done without following the mass line. However, the closed-door style of the institute in the past cannot but make people feel somewhat unfair. I am willing to state here: academic materials should be contributed to academic institutions as much as possible. I am prepared to contribute the full copy of "Min Bao," but I also request that academic institutions be more humble, open their doors, and follow the mass line, so that historical research can be done better. In fact, there are many materials on modern history that the Third Institute has not seen at all, nor has it investigated at all. It is necessary to contact a wider range of people to undertake this important task.

In a word, it is necessary to oppose sectarianism and eliminate all obstacles to academic research in order to truly achieve "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."

### 学术研究不能关起门来进行

    学术研究不能关起门来进行	江苏省文化局副局长  朱契
    自从党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以后，在文艺和学术研究方面，已经初步打开了过去沉闷的局面，产生了一种活跃的新气象。但是，现在虽已到了5月时节，然而春寒犹重。应该是春暖花开的时候了，但是百花犹未盛开。学术界还没有出现百家争鸣的盛况，出版界还存在着霜冻的现象。究竟是什么东西障碍着“百花齐放”、“百家争鸣”呢？
    我认为，在学术研究方面，所以还不能出现百家争鸣的盛况，主要是由于宗派主义在障碍着百家争鸣；它的危害性，有时还要超过教条主义。
    不错，在学术研究方面，最近一些时候也出现一些论争的场面，例如我国历史上奴隶社会时代和封建社会时代的分期问题，资本主义因素萌芽的问题；文学上旧诗和新诗的问题，对于社会主义现实主义的理解问题，对于红楼梦人物思想的研究分析问题，对于李后主词的评价问题；经济学上关于过渡时期的基本经济规律问题；哲学上关于无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾性质问题，……但是，整个说起来，我们的学术争鸣还是很不够的。有的争论展开了，但是过早地下了结论；有的报纸组织了争论，但是过早地收了兵，由权威人士出来讲了话，便草草了事。
    在历史科学方面，宗派主义的作风尤为严重。下面举中国科学院历史研究所第三所为例，来说明这个问题。
    本来学术的研究，是不能关起门来进行的；而史料的搜集，尤其必须走群众路线，发挥大家的积极性，团结一切可能团结的力量。但是历史研究所第三所这几年来，却一直是在关起大门来进行研究的。不但对于全国研究历史的人们，不肯去主动团结，对于全国散在各处的珍贵史料，不肯去主动地积极地搜集，相反地对于主动前来投稿、前来联系的人们，还要拒人于千里之外。在1951年冬天，我到安徽的涡阳县参加两次土改，并到涡河的北岸，访问了捻军领袖张乐行的故乡——张老家，深入地调查研究了张乐行、张宗禹的一些事迹，搜集了张家后代保存的家藏文献，访问了张乐行的从曾孙张羹材，并且调查了张氏的两处祖墓和张慰祖墓及张琢的衣冠冢。回来以后，我根据实地调查所得，写了一篇“捻军领袖张乐行事迹调查记”。当时罗尔纲先生正在南京编纂太平天国史料，因为捻军起义和太平天国革命有关，我拿去向他请教。他看了以后，认为调查得很深入详细，有许多材料，是从来不见记载的，值得加以发表，并建议向历史研究所主办的“历史研究”投稿。我当时犹疑了一下，认为和“历史研究”向无联系，投去以后未必登载。罗先生十分热心，又建议由历史研究所第三所派驻南京整理档案的王可风同志介绍投稿。当由王同志看了一遍，认为应该可以刊载，便代为寄投“历史研究”。过了四、五个月以后，原稿退回来了，没有加以任何批评，但轻轻写了几个字：
   “来稿与本刊体例不合，原稿退还。”
    我再投“历史教学”；“历史教学”回信说：“尊稿对捻军领袖张乐行和张琢的意见已收到，我刊拟稍加删节，如你同意，即拟设法刊出”。我只好同意了。该篇被缩去了一部分，在“历史教学”发表。事后我接到了该刊转来好几个读者的来信，对这篇文章表示很大的兴趣，并要求更多地介绍张乐行、张琢的事迹。最后我在光明日报史学副刊上，又补充了一些材料，发表了另一篇关于捻军的文字。但是“调查记”全文，至今还没有能够完全发表。
    与此成一个有趣的对照：最近却接到了历史研究所第三所的一封信，里面写道：“我们为了供研究者参考，计划选印同盟会系统的各杂志，现已决定将民报全份影印，正在摄制中。惟其中二十五、二十六两期缺底封面及广告各页，各处访问迄未借到。闻你处藏有民报全份，不知所缺各页，在你处能否补全。又民报附有天讨增刊一册，及三号外一张，现已觅齐，此外不知尚有其他增刊及号外否？”这一封信，有力地证明搜集资料是非走群众路线不可的。但是该所过去关门的作风，却不能不使人情绪上有些不平。我愿意在这里表示：学术资料应该尽量贡献给学术机关，我准备把全份民报贡献出来，但是也要求学术机关虚心一些，开放大门，走群众路线，才可以把历史研究工作做得更好。实际上有许多近代史资料，第三所还根本没有看到，也根本没有调查到，必须要联系更广泛的群众，才可以担负起这个重大的任务。
    一句话，必须要反对宗派主义，扫除学术研究上的一切障碍，才可以真正做到百家争鸣。
