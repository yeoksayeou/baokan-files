Helping the Communist Party Rectify and Improve Oneself Through Self-Remolding
Zhao Zukang, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

The convening of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's propaganda work conference this time, studying Chairman Mao's spirit and methods, and inviting non-Party figures to participate, is of great significance. This is a conference to lay the ideological foundation and create conditions in terms of measures for correctly handling contradictions among the people and asking non-Party figures to launch criticisms and expand democratic life. We non-Party figures should, at the meeting, help the Party and government-led departments expose contradictions, analyze problems, put forward criticisms, opinions, and suggestions, and thereby improve ourselves and remold ourselves.

I have studied Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on the rectification movement, and other relevant rectification documents, and realized that our country is in a period of great social change. The socialist transformation of hundreds of millions of people has achieved basic victory, and socialist construction is also proceeding victoriously. The relations between various classes have undergone fundamental changes, and thus contradictions among the people have become prominent. In order to correctly handle contradictions among the people, it is very important to carry out a rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism within the Communist Party. Bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, in fact, exist not only within the Communist Party, but also among non-Party intellectuals. Therefore, I have come to realize that the rectification of this ethos is not merely a matter within the Party, but a major event of epochal significance on a national scale to transform customs and habits that has never happened before in China or abroad, for all leading cadres and working cadres in agencies, schools, and enterprises across the country. The Communist Party's doing so is a great and brilliant measure.

The following are some immature opinions and suggestions I have for the Party:

First, regarding the issue of strengthening the relationship of cooperation and working together between the Party and non-Party figures. Intellectuals have an important role to play in the country's socialist construction, and it is necessary for the Party to be able to cooperate and work well with them. In the past, the Party has done a lot of political and ideological work among intellectuals and has achieved results, but there are still shortcomings and problems. Therefore, the contradictions between the Party and non-Party intellectuals are generally still relatively numerous. The reason for this, I believe, is primarily that many Party organizations and members do not have a sufficient understanding of the characteristics of intellectuals (especially the more prominent characteristics of senior intellectuals), and have not been able to know people well and assign them jobs commensurate with their abilities, allowing everyone to give full play to their strengths, according to these characteristics. These senior intellectuals have the following common characteristics, in the good aspects: (1) They are patriots; (2) They are relatively rich in a sense of purpose and are sincerely willing to serve socialism; (3) Over the past few years, they have received the Party's education and seen the proof of the facts, and they firmly believe that the Party's line is correct and that the Party has solutions in any situation. In addition, they also commonly possess weaknesses of varying degrees: such as considering themselves superior and arrogant, which I will not discuss much here. Among them, there are also varying degrees of political awareness and specific demands: such as their understanding of the Party's policies and principles; their understanding and views on the strengths and weaknesses of Party members' ideology and work style; their expectations for the country's socialist construction and production development, and their requirements for their own and their families' lives. These requirements vary: some are deep, some are shallow, some are "left," some are right, some have many, some have few. Secondly, on the Communist Party members' side, Comrade Ke Qingshi pointed out that the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism within the Shanghai Party are mainly manifested in five aspects. I would like to add three points of explanation here:

1.  The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class and masters the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method. Many Party members therefore take pride in this and believe that their standpoints and views are more correct than those of the masses. They generally look down on or do not pay enough attention to intellectuals from petty-bourgeois, bourgeois, or landlord class backgrounds. Some believe that intellectuals only care about their personal interests and do not care about the interests of the broad masses of the people; sometimes they are suspicious of them, provide little help, and do not trust them enough.

2.  The vast majority of Party members are very active and their work is very busy. They believe that their work methods have a set of old revolutionary experiences from the past. Often, they have not been able to achieve truly extensive democracy on the basis of democracy, and they have simplified democracy. Many people are still seriously studying and delving into their professional work, but they are generally unfamiliar with construction undertakings and lack experience, which makes their work even busier and more passive.

3.  Party members are rich in discipline and can abide by the Party's principle of "the lower level obeys the higher level." Whenever they receive instructions from higher levels, even if the instructions do not conform to the circumstances of the time and place, they still mechanically copy them and subjectively implement them, causing difficulties and ending up making efforts that are not appreciated.

The above-mentioned characteristics of intellectuals and some of the situations of Party members can be summarized as the pride and complacency of Party members and the arrogance of intellectuals, coupled with mutual "politeness," which has formed "walls" and "ditches" between the Party and intellectuals in many units, hindering cooperation and working together.

Now, I will talk about some examples of the ideological situations reflected by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

A member of a certain university said: The contradiction between Party members and non-Party members is mainly due to Party members believing that they are progressive, having a cold attitude, and being unwilling to contact non-Party intellectuals. Young teachers are very active before joining the Party, but after joining the Party, they become arrogant and do not pay attention to others. Someone from a certain bureau said: "Party members always like to handle things behind closed doors." A member said: "Some old cadres have the style of the military and treat construction undertakings with orders." Some also believe that they see more of the shortcomings of technicians and less of the positive side, placing technicians in purely technical work so that they are not linked to political and ideological work, or placing them in the circle of affairs, failing to give full play to their role. What is particularly serious is that some Party members have a rigid and superior style, do not respect non-Party intellectuals enough, and make them feel depressed and make it difficult to carry out their work. One member said: "In the agency, the Communist Party is the mother-in-law, League members and trade union members are the daughters, and I am the daughter-in-law. Returning to the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is like returning to my mother's house, where I can complain and talk about my inner thoughts." It reflects the serious problems that exist in the relationship between the Party and the masses in some departments. Therefore, I suggest that in order to strengthen the relationship of socialist cooperation, the Party should first overcome sectarianism in the organization and give more trust, use, authority, education, and assistance to senior intellectuals and general intellectuals in political life, in leadership and organizational work, ideological education work in agencies, schools, etc., and in other aspects. Only by being able to trust, respect, care for, learn from, take the strengths of others to make up for one's own shortcomings, help each other, criticize each other, discuss matters, and stipulate some necessary systems of division of labor and cooperation can we truly achieve having a position, power, and responsibility, and cooperate and work together well, which is conducive to the cause of socialism.

Regarding the issue of close relations between the Party and intellectuals, it is also necessary to specifically point out that more contact and communication outside of the eight-hour working day and more common life are one of the important keys to strengthening unity and enhancing the relationship of cooperation and working together between the Party and intellectuals. Comrade Ke Qingshi advocated that each unit should not hold meetings on Thursdays, so that everyone can go to factories or the front line to closely contact the masses and talk about their inner thoughts, which is very necessary. Therefore, it is suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China should gradually establish a system of Party-masses contact outside of work through the Municipal People's Committee, so that Party members and non-Party intellectuals can have the opportunity to "have heart-to-heart talks and have tea around the stove," and truly achieve "saying everything they know and saying everything without reservation."

Second, regarding the issue of the Party increasing trust in members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in agencies, schools, and enterprises and giving full play to their work enthusiasm. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is a democratic party in the Chinese People's Democratic United Front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Over the past few years since liberation, our Shanghai local organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has gradually expanded its contacts with the masses, strengthened its ranks, improved its ideological understanding, participated in the consultation of state affairs, and played a certain role in various political movements and various work positions under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our Central Committee. Our members are all intellectuals, among whom senior intellectuals account for a considerable proportion, accounting for about 70% of the total number of members. Among them, many people have a certain degree of attainment in the traditional culture of the motherland (for example, the Shanghai Museum of Literature and History has more than 90 members), and many others hold certain positions in agencies, schools (colleges or middle schools), and enterprises, and many people hold relatively important positions. They generally have relatively rich scientific, technological, or administrative management experience. Due to historical conditions, they are particularly eager to learn and remold themselves in order to better become close friends and assistants of the Party. However, also due to historical conditions, some of them have not been trusted for a long time, and some have suffered some grievances in the social transformation movement, feeling inferior, unable to raise their heads, and not giving full play to their work enthusiasm. Moreover, some CPC organizations and members do not recognize the characteristics of the nature of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, underestimate or do not understand the history and its role, so that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang cannot play a role in these units. Therefore, some members said: "There is no wall between me and the Communist Party. If there is a wall, it is built by the Party." This is a loss to the construction of socialism. Therefore, it is suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pay more attention to the education of the united front policy in agencies, schools, and enterprises, give more trust and assistance to members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and educate the grass-roots organizations of the Communist Party of China to give due attention and assistance to the grass-roots organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in order to tear down this wall.

Third, regarding the ideological education work of democratic parties. In this regard, the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee has provided a lot of help in the past, but the Propaganda Department lacks contact and specific help. We must strengthen ideological and political education within and outside the Party, and we must ask the Propaganda Department to provide more support. We have heard that Fujian Province has a relatively good experience. The propaganda offices of various parties in Fujian are linked to the Propaganda Department of the CPC Provincial and Municipal Committees. The Propaganda Department holds at least one meeting every month to arrange the work below, and various parties can obtain the information of the meeting decisions and arrange the work at the grass-roots level in advance, so that the pace is consistent. We ask the Propaganda Department to pay attention to the guidance and assistance of the propaganda and education work of democratic parties, and consider the method of Fujian Province.

Fourth, regarding the employment and relief issues of members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the masses they contact. All those who joined the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang before 1955 have basically been employed with the great help of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Municipal Committee and relevant departments, except for a few people. The number of people who joined the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang after 1956 and have not been employed is relatively large. For these people, we must first conduct education, encourage them to think of various ways to engage in service-oriented or productive labor under the permission of national plans and policies to overcome temporary difficulties. At the same time, we hope that the Party and the government will give more care and arrange jobs for those who have the ability to work and are needed by society as soon as possible. The Party and the government have done a lot of work for some people who need relief, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should continue to handle this matter in cooperation with the government in the future. In addition, Shanghai has a large population, and it is relatively difficult to solve it by relying solely on Shanghai. It is suggested that the Party and the government study and mobilize intellectuals who are suitable to go to other places to go to the countryside. Now the countryside needs intellectuals, but most of them are unwilling to go to the countryside. A member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang raised the issue that the physical strength of intellectuals going to the countryside is not as good as that of farmers, and the work points earned by labor are few. He suggested that the government consider appropriate handling and provide care to encourage them to go to the countryside.

The above four points of opinions, because they only talk about criticisms and suggestions to the Party, are inevitably one-sided, and some are only based on the reflections of some people, which may deviate from the facts. They are put forward only for the Party to conduct inspection work and improve its style, to help the Party rectify its style, and to assist the Party and the government in correctly handling contradictions among the people.

    帮助共产党整风　提高自己改造自己
    民革上海市委副主任委员　赵祖康
    这次中共上海市委召开宣传工作会议，学习毛主席的精神和方法，邀请党外人士参加，是具有重大意义的。这是一个为了正确处理人民内部矛盾，要求党外人士展开批评、扩大民主生活在思想上打下基础、在措施上创造条件的会议。我们党外人士应当在会议中帮助党和政府所领导的各个部门揭露矛盾，分析问题，提出批评、意见和建议，并从而提高自己，改造自己。
    我学习了毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话，和中共中央关于整风运动的指示，以及其他有关整风文件，认识到我们国家处在社会大变动时期，几万万人的社会主义改造得到基本上的胜利，社会主义建设也正在胜利进行，各个阶级的关系发生了根本性的变化，因而人民内部之间的矛盾显得突出了。为了正确处理人民内部矛盾，在共产党内进行一次反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的整风运动就十分重要了。官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义事实上不仅是在中共党内存在着，在党外知识分子中间同样存在着。因此，我体会到这一个风气的整顿，不仅仅是党内的事情，也是全国在机关、学校、企业内领导与工作干部大家的事情，是中外古今从未有过的全国规模移风易俗的一件天大的事情。共产党这样做，是一个伟大英明的措施。
    以下是我向党提出的一些不成熟的意见和建议：
    第一，关于加强党和党外人士合作共事的关系问题。国家进行社会主义建设，知识分子有它重要的作用，需要党能够同他们很好地合作共事。党在以往对知识分子做了不少政治思想工作，取得了成绩，但还存在着缺点和问题。因此，党和党外知识分子的矛盾一般的还是比较多的。它的原因，我认为首先由于不少党的组织和党员对知识分子的特点（尤其是高级知识分子比较显著的特点），认识不够，没有能根据特点，知人善任，各尽所长。这些高级知识分子有以下几个共同特点，在好的方面：（一）是爱国主义者；（二）比较富有事业观念，诚诚恳恳地愿意为社会主义服务；（三）几年来受到党的教育以及眼看事实的证明，深信党的路线是正确的，党在任何情况下是有办法的。此外，他们也每每共同地存在着不同程度的弱点：如自命清高，自高自大，这里不多谈。他们中间还各有不同程度的政治觉悟和具体要求：例如对于党的方针政策的体会；对于党员的思想方法、工作作风的优缺点方面的理解和看法；对于国家社会主义建设、生产发展的期望和对他们自己及家庭生活的要求。这些要求都各有不同：有深有浅，有“左”有右，人有多有少。其次，在共产党员一方面，柯庆施同志指出上海党内的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义主要表现在五个方面，我想在这里补充三点说明：
    1、共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，掌握马克思主义的立场、观点、方法；不少党员因此引以自豪，认为自己的立场、观点都比群众来得正确，对小资产阶级、资产阶级、地主阶级出身的知识分子一般是看不起或者是不够重视的。有的认为知识分子只顾个人利益，不顾广大人民的利益；有时对他们有疑虑，帮助少，信任不够。
    2、绝大多数的党员是很积极的，他们的工作都很忙，他们的工作方法自以为有以往革命老经验的一套，对于民主基础之上的集中，往往没能做到真正广泛的民主，把民主简单化了。很多人还认真学习钻研业务，但对于建设事业一般的比较生疏，缺乏经验，使工作更加忙而被动。
    3、党员都富有纪律性，都能遵照党的“下级服从上级”的原则办事，每逢接到上级指示，即使指示有不符合此时此地情况，也还是生硬地照搬，主观地执行，造成困难，结果弄得吃力不讨好。
    以上知识分子的若干特点同党员的一些情况，可归纳为党员的骄傲自满、知识分子的自高自大两点，加以彼此“客气”，使在不少单位中党与知识分子中间形成了“墙”和“沟”，妨碍了合作共事。
    现在就民革所反映出来的思想情况的一些例子谈谈。
    某一高等学校的成员说：党与非党的矛盾，主要由于党员自以为自己是进步的，态度冷淡，不愿接触党外知识分子，年青的教师在未入党之前很活泼，一入党就两眼朝天，不把别人放在眼里。某一局有人说：“党员总喜欢关了门处理事情。”某一成员说：“老干部有些军队作风，以命令来对待建设事业。”也有认为对技术人员缺点看得多，积极的一面看得少，把技术人员放在单纯技术工作上，使他们不与政治思想工作联系起来，或者把他们放在事务圈子里，没有充分发挥作用。特别严重的是有些党员作风生硬，高人一等，对非党知识分子不够尊重，使他们情绪低落，工作不易展开。有一位成员说：“在机关里共产党是婆婆，团员和工会会员是姑娘，自己是媳妇，回到民革来像回娘家，可以诉诉苦，谈谈心里话。”它反映了党群关系在有些部门存在严重的问题。因此，我建议：为了加强社会主义的共事合作关系，党应该首先克服组织上的宗派主义，对高级知识分子和一般知识分子，在政治生活上，在机关、学校等领导组织工作、思想教育工作以及在其他方面，都要予以更多的信任，更多的使用，更多的职权，更多的教育和帮助。唯有能相互信任，相互尊重、关心，相互学习，取长补短，相互帮助，相互批评，商量办事，并且规定一些必要的分工合作制度，才能切实做到有职、有权、有责，很好地合作共事，有利于社会主义事业。
    关于密切党和知识分子的关系方面，还要特别提出：在工作时间八小时以外多接触联系，多过共同生活，是加强团结、增进党和知识分子合作共事关系的重要关键之一。柯庆施同志主张每个单位每星期四不要开会，使大家能下厂或下现场来密切联系群众，讲讲知心话，这是很需要的。因此，建议中共上海市委通过市人民委员会逐步建立起工作以外的党群联系制度，从而使党员与党外知识分子能有机会“促膝谈心，围炉茶话”，真正做到“知无不言，言无不尽”。
    第二，关于党对在机关、学校、企业中民革成员增加信任，充分发挥其工作积极性问题。中国国民党革命委员会是在中国共产党领导之下的中国人民民主统一战线中的一个民主党派。解放几年来，我们民革上海市地方组织在中共和我党中央的领导下，逐步地扩大了与群众的联系，壮大了队伍，提高了思想认识，参加了国家事务的协商，并且在各项政治运动中和各种不同的工作岗位上发挥了一定的作用。我们的成员都是知识分子，其中高级知识分子占相当大的比重，约占成员总数的70％左右。他们中间有不少人在祖国的传统文化方面有一定的素养（例如上海文史馆有成员九十多人），另有不少人在机关、学校（大专或中学）企业里担任一定的工作，有许多人担任比较重要的工作。他们一般都具有比较丰富的科学技术或行政管理的经验，由于历史条件，他们要求学习要求改造以更好地成为党的亲密朋友和助手特别殷切。但也由于历史条件，他们之中的一部分人长期得不到信任，更有些人在社会改造运动中受了一些委屈，感到自卑，抬不起头，没有充分发挥其工作积极性。更加以有部分中共党组织和党员没有认识民革性质的特点，轻视或不了解民革历史和它的作用，使民革在这些单位中也不能发挥作用。因而，有的成员说：“我对共产党之间是没有墙的，假使有墙的话，那是党方面搭起来的。”这是建设社会主义的一个损失。因此，建议中共上海市委对机关、学校、企业中的统战政策教育予以更多的注意，给民革成员以更多的信任与帮助，并教育中共各基层组织给民革基层组织以应有的重视与帮助，以拆掉这一垛墙。
    第三，关于民主党派思想教育工作问题。就这方面，市委统战部以往帮助得不少，但宣传部很缺乏联系和具体帮助。我们要加强对党内外的思想政治教育，必须要求宣传部多加支持。我们听说福建省有一个比较好的经验。福建各党派宣传处是与中共省市委宣传部挂钩的，宣传部每月至少开一次会，布置下面工作，各党派能够得到会议决定的资料，预先对基层布置工作，步调就取得一致了。我们要求宣传部能够重视对民主党派的宣传教育工作的指导与帮助，并考虑福建省这个办法。
    第四，关于民革成员及联系群众的就业救济问题。凡是在1955年之前参加民革的，承中共市委统战部及有关方面大力帮助，除少数几个人外，基本上都已就了业。1956年以后参加民革而没有就业的人数比较多。对这些人，我们首先要进行教育，鼓励他们自己想各种办法，在国家计划和政策许可下，从事服务性的劳动，或生产性的劳动，以克服暂时的困难。同时，我们希望党和政府给予更多的关心，在对有工作能力而社会又需要的情况下，及早予以安排工作。对于有些需要进行救济的，党和政府已做了不少工作，今后在这方面，民革自应协助政府继续办理。此外，上海人口众多，单靠上海解决是比较困难的，建议党和政府研究动员适合到外埠去的知识分子下乡。现在农村方面需要知识分子，但他们大多不愿意下乡。民革有一成员提出知识分子下乡体力不及农民，劳动所得的工分少的问题，建议政府考虑适当处理，予以照顾，鼓励他们下乡。
    以上四点意见，因为只就对党的批评和建议谈，不免是片面的，有些也只是根据一部分人的反映，可能与事实有出入，提出来仅供党进行检查工作、改进作风的参考，以帮助党整风，以协助党和政府正确地处理人民内部矛盾。
