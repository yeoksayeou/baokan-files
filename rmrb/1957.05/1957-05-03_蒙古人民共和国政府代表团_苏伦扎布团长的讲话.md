Dear Comrades,

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, I would like to extend my fraternal and sincere congratulations to all the participants in this celebration and, through you, to all the working people of Inner Mongolia, on behalf of all the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, our government, and the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

May 1, 1947, marked an unprecedented and magnificent era in the history of the people of Inner Mongolia.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the direct assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the people of Inner Mongolia were liberated from the dark rule of Japanese imperialism in 1945 and established the autonomous region on May 1, 1947. The People's Army of the Mongolian People's Republic also contributed to the just struggle of the fraternal people of Inner Mongolia to rid themselves of Japanese imperialist rule.

The founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, liberated all the Chinese people and the people of Inner Mongolia from imperialism and domestic reactionary rule, eliminated centuries of backwardness, and led them to the path of socialist construction, the most beautiful and happy in human history. Therefore, the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is not only a joyous event for the people of Inner Mongolia and the Chinese people but also a major joyous event for the people of all countries in the socialist camp.

The people of the Mongolian People's Republic and the people of Inner Mongolia have always been of the same ethnicity and have shared joys and sorrows as brothers and sisters since ancient times.

We celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with unparalleled sincerity and joy.

The common struggle of the people of the Mongolian People's Republic and the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China has a long history, and our two peoples have jointly experienced the dark rule of the Qing Dynasty.

After shaking off the rule of the Qing Dynasty, the people of Inner Mongolia were ravaged by warlords instigated by imperialist countries around the world. Then, they were subjected to the cruel oppression of Japanese militarism, the public enemy of the people of all Asian countries. At that time, we, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, regarded the suffering of our fraternal people of Inner Mongolia as our own and felt deep sympathy and great indignation.

After the end of World War II, hundreds of millions of Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, were liberated, and the people of Inner Mongolia were able to enjoy such a happy and beautiful life today.

The people, who had been enslaved for hundreds of years, took power into their own hands, realized the national equality they had longed for for many years, broke the feudal shackles, and the vast number of farmers and herdsmen gained the freedom to cultivate and graze.

In the past ten years, the people of Inner Mongolia have changed the old relations of production and established new socialist relations of production.

In the past ten years, the hardworking and brave people of Inner Mongolia, with the direct concern and help of hundreds of millions of Han compatriots, and working together with one heart, have achieved brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. That is: the cultivated area of agriculture, which occupies a major position in the economy, has been expanded, and the output has been increased. The number of livestock in animal husbandry, which occupies an important part of the economy, has increased from 8 million in 1947 to the current 25 million, and the vast number of farmers and herdsmen have participated in seasonal or year-round mutual aid teams on a voluntary basis, building a happy life with collective strength, which is a concrete symbol of the realization of socialist principles.

In the past ten years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established more than 800 large and small industries. The total output value of industry accounts for about 23% of the entire economy, which shows the great achievements made in the industrial field.

The Baotou Iron and Steel Complex and the Greater Khingan Range forest industry, which are currently under construction, are also large-scale industries that occupy an important position in the whole of China. Industries such as leather, condensed milk and sugar making, and agricultural tool manufacturing for the processing of animal husbandry products are newly developed socialist economic sectors. The newly built industries complete their tasks according to their own monthly or quarterly plans, which plays a major role in improving the material life of the people. With the development of industry, the working class is also growing day by day. Herdsmen and farmers who had no skills in the past have mastered new technologies and new operating methods, which is commendable. In the past seven years, the number of Mongolian workers and staff members has increased tenfold, which proves that there are already technical talents of their own nationality.

In the past ten years, the cultural level of the people of Inner Mongolia has been greatly improved. The number of Mongolian students has now reached more than 120,000, which means that one in nine Mongolians is studying in school. There are now three universities, 105 secondary schools, and 930 primary schools, with a total of 932,000 students of all nationalities. Inner Mongolia University will open this year, which is a major event in the cultural history of Inner Mongolia.

With the improvement of the economic and cultural life of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the people's political consciousness and enthusiasm have also been unprecedentedly high, so they have participated more actively in the socialist construction of the motherland. The great achievements that the people of Inner Mongolia have made in the past ten years are primarily the result of the correct application and implementation of the Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalist national policy by the Communist Party of China, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the vigorous socialist construction that is currently underway are a powerful blow to the malicious conspiracy of imperialism to drag Asian countries into a new vortex of war and undermine world peace.

The fraternal People's Republic of China is providing us, the Mongolian People's Republic, with great assistance in terms of manpower and material resources, which plays a major role in our construction cause, for which we express our deep respect and gratitude.

Great China is a reliable pillar for our independent survival and the consolidation of national security, and it is also a reliable force for our socialist construction cause. Dear comrades, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic and the people of Inner Mongolia have both experienced a long period of arduous years.

As a result of the heroic struggle waged by the Chinese people and the people of Inner and Outer Mongolia side by side in 1911-1912, the rule of the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. In that revolutionary wave, the Mongolian people launched a national liberation movement and began the struggle for national independence. However, because there was no strong and effective party to give correct guidance and no reliable support, the people's struggle was exploited by internal feudal forces, and a double oppression regime manipulated by the internal and external reactionary factions of the so-called "Outer Mongolia Autonomous Region" was established.

Under the influence of the new era in human history—the October Socialist Revolution—the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, led by the outstanding sons of the Mongolian people, Sukhe Bator and Choibalsan, with the direct assistance of the great Soviet people, led the Outer Mongolian people in revolutionary struggle, gaining liberation and freedom in 1921, eliminating historical backwardness, and advancing for the socialist construction of their motherland. In the revolutionary era, our people have made great achievements in consolidating their completely independent and autonomous state power and in developing the national economy and culture. Therefore, national industries have been established, and a new working class and national intellectuals have emerged; our construction cause is accelerating year by year. In the revolutionary era, the number of our livestock has increased 2.5 times, and it has increased 7.3 times in the last four years alone. In recent years, active work has been done to mechanize agriculture and animal husbandry and to develop various departments.

The sown area in 1956 increased by 44.9% compared with the past, and the harvest of grain crops increased by 1.5 times.

An important reform that has taken place in agriculture and animal husbandry is the development of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural and animal husbandry production.

The number of agricultural and animal husbandry production cooperatives has increased from 198 in 1954 to more than 600 now, an increase of two times. Thus, our party has put forward the policy of realizing the collectivization of more than 50% of individual households in the national economy by 1960.

Our industry has successfully completed the targets of the two five-year plans, with the total industrial output value increasing by an average of 10.3% per year, and it has increased by 40% in the last four years, thus overfulfilling the plan. The investment in the national economy in the last four years has increased by two times compared with the first five-year plan.

In the revolutionary era, the people's material and cultural life has been greatly improved.

Now, all adults in our country have learned the national writing, and we have also established our own national university and many higher, secondary, and vocational and technical schools. In the last four years alone, the actual wages of workers and staff members have increased by 40%, and the actual income of herdsmen has increased by 58%.

In order to improve the people's material and cultural life, our party and government have always attached importance to this and have taken many effective measures.

Workers and staff members of the Mongolian People's Republic, in addition to festivals and holidays, have 14-30 days of paid leave per year; pregnant women have three months of rest during the maternity period. The Fourth Session of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, which was recently held, adopted the awarding of the title of "Mother Hero" to mothers with many children and awarded them first- and second-class medals, while increasing their bonuses; and stipulated a system of working six hours on the day before festivals and holidays and on Saturdays, which has encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people in building socialism.

The increasingly developing achievements of our country are inseparable from the active efforts of the independent Mongolian working people who are creating their glorious history to build socialism, and they are also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. A concrete fact is: the joint transport railway of the three fraternal countries of Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union. This railway is of great significance for the development of the economy and culture of the three countries. Therefore, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic affectionately call this railway the "Road of Friendship." Our country has entered socialism, the people are living a happy life, and we have made contributions to the cause of world peace.

Now, in addition to establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, we have also established diplomatic relations with 15 countries in Asia, including the great power of India and Indonesia, which account for more than half of the world's population. During World War II, our country firmly stood on the side of the Allied countries and constantly provided material and spiritual assistance to the anti-fascist struggle. We contributed our strength to stopping the scourge of war.

The basis of our country's foreign policy is to adhere to the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with all countries on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Now imperialism is carrying out conspiracies to sabotage and disintegrate the socialist countries of the peace camp from within. The Hungarian incident that occurred last year is a concrete example of this. Therefore, while the socialist countries are on high alert, they are resolutely fighting against the conspiracies they are carrying out. In the era of foreign aggressors' rule in the past, they provoked the relationship between the Han nationality and the Inner and Outer Mongolian nationalities, causing them to fight each other. Now we are living a free and equal life in the socialist family, and we are advancing together for the construction of socialism, which gives our people infinite encouragement. There is no problem that cannot be resolved through consultation among the socialist camp.

Chinese Comrades! The people of Inner Mongolia and the thousands upon thousands of people of the great People's Republic of China have made great achievements in building socialism on their own soil in the past few years, which excites us, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the peace-loving people of the world very much.

The great achievements made by the thousands upon thousands of people of the People's Republic of China are consolidating the cause of peace in the socialist camp in Asia and the Far East, and at the same time, they are encouraging the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, who are working hard to build socialism on their own soil. On this historically significant tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic heartily congratulate the fraternal people of Inner Mongolia on achieving greater achievements in the cause of developing the autonomous region.

May the friendship between the people of the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China further develop and be consolidated.

Dear comrades, please accept the gifts and commemorative banners presented by the government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic to congratulate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    蒙古人民共和国政府代表团
    苏伦扎布团长的讲话
    亲爱的同志们：
    在此庆祝内蒙古自治区成立十周年之际，我谨代表蒙古人民共和国全体人民和我国政府以及蒙古人民革命党中央委员会，向参加这次庆祝大会的全体人员并通过你们向内蒙古全体劳动人民致以兄弟般的诚挚的祝贺。
    1947年5月1日在内蒙古人民的历史上出现了前所未有的宏伟时期。
    内蒙古人民在中国共产党领导下，在苏联红军的直接帮助下，于1945年从日本帝国主义的黑暗统治下被解放出来，在1947年5月1日成立了自治区。在兄弟的内蒙古人民为摆脱日本帝国主义的统治而进行的正义斗争中，蒙古人民共和国人民军也贡献了自己的一份力量。
    1949年10月1日中华人民共和国的成立，把全中国人民和内蒙古人民从帝国主义及国内反动统治下解放了出来，消除了几百年来的落后状态，并引向了人类最美好幸福的社会主义建设的道路。所以庆祝内蒙古自治区成立十周年不仅是内蒙古人民和中国人民的喜事，同时也是社会主义阵营各国人民的大喜事。
    蒙古人民共和国人民与内蒙古人民从来就是同一民族，并自古以来就是同甘共苦，骨肉相连的兄弟。
    我们以无比诚挚的和愉快的心情来庆祝内蒙古自治区成立十周年。
    蒙古人民共和国人民和中华人民共和国内蒙古自治区人民的共同斗争是有着悠久的历史，并且我们两国人民共同经历过清朝黑暗统治的年代。
    内蒙古人民在摆脱了清朝统治后，又受到被世界各帝国主义国家所唆使的军阀的蹂躏。接着又遭到了亚洲各国人民的公敌日本军国主义残酷的压榨，在那个时候我们蒙古人民共和国人民，把兄弟的内蒙古人民所受到的痛苦，看作是自己的痛苦，并怀着深切的同情和极大的愤慨。
    世界第二次大战结束后，中国几亿人民在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，获得了解放，于是内蒙古人民才得到今天这样幸福美好的生活。
    几百年来被奴役的人民把政权掌握在自己的手里，实现了多年以来所渴望着的民族平等，截断了封建枷锁，广大农牧民得到了耕种和放牧的自由。
    在这十年当中内蒙古人民改变了旧的生产关系，建立了社会主义的新的生产关系。
    过去的十年内，勤劳勇敢的内蒙古人民，在几亿汉族同胞的直接关怀和帮助下，与他们同心协力的进行建设，在政治、经济、文化等各方面都得到了光辉的成就。这就是：在经济中占主要地位的农业的耕地面积扩大，提高了产量。在经济中占重要一部分的牧业牲畜的头数，由1947年的八百万头，增到了现在的二千五百万头，并且广大农牧民按自愿原则参加了季节性的或常年的互助组，以集体的力量建设着幸福的生活，这是实现着社会主义原则的具体象征。
    过去的十年内，内蒙古自治区建立了八百多个大小型的工业，在整个经济中，工业的总产值占23％左右，这表明了在工业方面所获得的巨大成就。
    现在正在兴建的包头钢铁联合企业以及大兴安岭森林工业是在全中国来说也是占重要地位的大型工业。在牧业产品加工方面有皮革、炼乳和制糖、制造农具等工业，都是新发展起来的社会主义经济部门。新建的工业，按照自己所订的月份或季度计划完成任务，这在提高人民的物质生活上起着重大的作用。随着工业的发展工人阶级也是日益增长，过去没有一技之长的牧民、农民已经掌握了新技术和新操作方法，这是值得赞扬的事情。近七年来，蒙古族职工的人数增加了十倍，这证明已经有了自己民族的技术人才。
    在过去十年内，内蒙古人民的文化水平得到了很大提高。现在蒙古族学生人数已达到了十二万多名，也就是说九个蒙古人中就有一个人在学校学习。现在有高等学校三所，中等学校一百零五所，初等学校九百三十所，计有各民族学生九十三万二千余名。在今年内蒙古大学即将开学，这在内蒙古文化历史上来说，是一件重大的事情。
    随着内蒙古自治区的经济文化生活提高的同时，人民的政治觉悟和积极性也空前高涨，从而更加积极参加了祖国的社会主义建设事业，在过去的十年中，内蒙古人民所以获得这些巨大的成就，首先是由于中国共产党和人民政府及毛泽东主席正确的运用和执行马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义的民族政策的结果。
    1949年中华人民共和国成立，目前正在大力进行着社会主义建设，这对帝国主义企图把亚洲各国拖入新的战争漩涡和破坏世界和平的恶毒阴谋来说是一个有力的打击。
    兄弟的中华人民共和国对我们蒙古人民共和国在人力物力等方面正在大力帮助，这对我国建设事业上是起着重大的作用，对此我们表示深切的敬意和感激。
    伟大的中国对我国独立生存和巩固国家安全上是一个可靠的支柱，并对我国建设社会主义的事业上也是可靠的力量。亲爱的同志们：蒙古人民共和国人民和内蒙古人民同样经历过长时期艰苦的岁月。
    中国人民和内外蒙古人民于1911—1912年并肩进行英勇斗争的结果，推翻了清朝统治，在那个革命风浪里，蒙古人民掀起了民族解放运动，开始了争取民族独立的斗争。但是由于没有坚强有力的给予正确指导的政党领导，也得不到可靠的支援，因而人民所进行的斗争被内部封建势力所利用，建立了所谓“外蒙古自治区”的内外反动派所操纵的双重压迫政权。
    人类历史的新纪元——十月社会主义革命影响下，蒙古人民的优秀儿子苏和巴托、乔巴山所领导的蒙古人民革命党在伟大的苏联人民的直接援助下，领导外蒙古人民进行革命斗争，于1921年获得了解放与自由，消除了历史上的落后状态，并正在为自己祖国的社会主义建设前进。在革命的年代里，我国人民在巩固自己的完全独立、自主的国家政权，在发展民族的经济、文化方面取得了很大成绩。因此，建立了民族工业，出现了新的工人阶级和民族的知识分子；我们的建设事业一年比一年不断地加快着速度。在革命的年代里我们的牲畜头数增长了二点五倍，仅仅在近四年中增长了七点三倍。近年来为使农牧业机械化，并为各部门的发展而作了积极的工作。
    1956年播种面积比以前增加了44.9％，粮食作物收获量增加了一点五倍。
    在农牧业中所发生的重要改革，就是农牧业生产的互助合作事业的发展。
    农牧业生产合作社由1954年的一百九十八，现在发展到六百多，增长了二倍，从而我们的党提出了使国民经济中50％以上的个体户在1960年实现合作化的方针。
    我们的工业顺利地完成了两个五年计划的目标，工业总产值每年平均增长10.3％，近四年增长了40％，从而超额完成了计划，近四年的国民经济投资比第一个五年计划增加了两倍。
    在革命的年代里，人民的物质、文化生活有了很大的提高。
    现在我国成年人都学会了民族文字，还建立了自己民族的大学及许多高等、中等学校、专业技术学校。仅四年来，职工的实际工资提高了40％，牧民的实际收入提高了58％。
    为了提高人民的物质、文化生活，我们的党和政府经常予以重视并采取了许多有效措施。
    蒙古人民共和国的工人、职员，除了节、假日外每年保留工资的休假14—30天；孕妇在产期休息三个月。最近召开的蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔第四次会议所通过的奖给多子女的母亲以“母亲英雄”的称号，并给予一、二等奖章，同时增加了她们的奖金；规定了工人、职员的节、假日前一天和星期六工作六小时的制度，从而鼓舞了广大人民群众的建设社会主义积极性。
    我国日益发展的成就是与创造自己光荣历史的独立的蒙古劳动人民建设社会主义的积极努力分不开的，也是与以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义各国的无私援助分不开的。其具体事实是：蒙—中—苏三个兄弟国家的联运铁路。这个铁路对发展三国的经济、文化方面具有重大的意义。因此，蒙古人民共和国人民亲切地称这条铁路为“友谊之路”。我国已经进入社会主义，人民过着幸福的生活，为世界和平事业作出了贡献。
    现在我国除和苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家建立了外交关系外，并与亚洲的大国——印度共和国、印度尼西亚等占世界人口半数以上的十五个国家建立了外交关系。在第二次世界大战期间，我国坚决站在同盟国方面，对反法西斯斗争，经常给与物质与精神上援助，为了制止战争的灾祸，我们贡献了自己的力量。
    我国外交政策的依据是坚持在互相尊重领土完整和主权的互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利和和平共处五项原则的基础上同一切国家建立正常的外交关系。现在帝国主义对和平阵营的社会主义国家进行从内部破坏瓦解的阴谋活动。去年发生的匈牙利事件就是其具体事例。因此社会主义阵营各国在引起高度警惕的同时，对他们所进行的阴谋活动进行了坚决的斗争。过去在外国侵略者统治的年代里，他们挑拨汉族与内外蒙民族之间的关系，使之互相斗争。现在我们在社会主义大家庭中过着自由平等的生活，共同为建设社会主义前进，这给我国人民以无限的鼓舞。在社会主义阵营之间没有任何一个问题不可能通过协商来取得解决的。
    中国同志们！内蒙古人民和伟大的中华人民共和国的千千万万人民，在自己国土上建立社会主义方面过去几年中取得了巨大的成就，这使我们蒙古人民共和国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民非常兴奋。
    中华人民共和国的千千万万人民所取得的伟大成就，巩固着亚洲和远东的社会主义阵营的和平事业，同时鼓舞着在自己的土地上为建设社会主义而努力着的蒙古人民共和国的人民。具有历史意义的内蒙古自治区成立十周年的今天，蒙古人民共和国的人民衷心的祝贺兄弟般的内蒙古人民在发展自治区的事业中取得更大的成就。
    祝蒙古人民共和国，中华人民共和国的人民之间的友好进一步发展和巩固。
    敬爱的同志们：请接受蒙古人民共和国政府和人民为祝贺内蒙古自治区成立十周年而赠送的礼物和纪念锦旗。
