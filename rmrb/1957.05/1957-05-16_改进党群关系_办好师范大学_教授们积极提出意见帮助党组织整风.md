Professors Actively Offer Opinions to Help the Party Organization Rectify

    (Our Dispatch) The Beijing Normal University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited professors and associate professors from the Chinese, Education, Russian, and History departments for discussions on the 10th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, respectively. The professors put forward criticisms and suggestions regarding the Party's leadership work at the university.

    Hu Ming said that Party members have a special sense of superiority, and individual Party members adopt crude methods to maintain "prestige."

    What is the relationship between the Party and the masses at Beijing Normal University? Many professors are concerned about this issue. Hu Ming, Director of the Russian Department, said: "The main contradiction in our school now is the poor relationship between the Party and the masses, and the main aspect of the main contradiction is the Party members and the Party organization. Some Party members have a special sense of superiority and look down on the general masses, thus becoming detached from the masses. Some people always say that the masses are inferior, but in fact, the masses are not inferior. It is because Party members have a special sense of superiority, exaggerating their own role and contributions, which makes the masses relatively inferior. More seriously, individual Party members adopt crude methods to maintain 'prestige,' which has a very bad influence among the masses."

    Li Changzhi, a professor in the Chinese Department, said: "The wall between the Party organization and the masses in Normal University is very thick, as solid as reinforced concrete. If this wall is not demolished, there is a risk of it becoming thicker and thicker." "True friendship values understanding the heart." Originally, the masses are very willing to be close friends with Party members, but Party members do not show this. The work style of Party members does affect the relationship between the Party and the masses, but the masses often establish feelings with the Party through individual Party members. Many young Communist Party members in Normal University have not undergone the training of sharing hardships with the masses. After joining the Party, many senior intellectuals become detached from the masses and become power-holders, unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses and like to put on an educational posture, which easily makes people feel disgusted.

    He Tingjie, a professor of Political Education, said: "Now everyone says there is a wall between the Party and the masses. This statement is problematic. It is not that there is a wall between the Party and the masses, but that there is a wall between some grassroots Party organizations, Party members, and the masses. It doesn't matter if a few individuals remain outside the wall, but it is not conducive to socialist construction if there are too many people outside the wall. Who built this wall? Some say it is a two-way street: on the one hand, it is a sense of inferiority, which can be broken with a single touch; on the other hand, it is a sense of superiority, which is a wall made of cement mixed with electrical wiring and carrying current. Fortunately, it is not yet connected as a whole, otherwise it would be too dangerous."

    Professor Zhu Zhixian said: "The problem of Party-masses relations is mainly the problem of the relationship between the Party and veteran teachers. Administrative leaders seem more important than teaching staff. In schools, the idea that teaching should rely on teaching staff, especially the thinking of relying on veteran teachers, is not clear. After liberation, a trend formed of overemphasizing new teachers, and the Party's support for veteran teachers is insufficient. There is an unhealthy trend among young comrades. Some are very obedient to leaders and Party members, which is of course very good, but they do not respect or value veteran teachers and the masses enough. Some young comrades were very humble before joining the Party, but after joining the Party, they became different. 'If you raise them without teaching them, it is the father's fault.' The Party should give them education."

    Shao Heting said: "I hope the Party organization carefully considers various new ways to connect with the masses." He suggested that, in addition to contacting the masses through democratic parties, the Party should fully utilize trade union organizations, open up all issues to the masses, treat the masses as their own people, fill the gap between the Party and the masses, and enable everyone to have a sense of ownership.

    Tai Shuangqiu said that professors are situated below four layers of floors and outside four walls.

    How can the school widely absorb the opinions of professors? How to expand the contacts of professors with all parties? Professor Tai Shuangqiu said: "In the school, professors are situated below four layers of floors and outside four walls. The top layer of these four floors is the president, followed by the dean of academic affairs, the director of the research department, etc. The next layer is the department head, and there is also a layer of teaching and research section heads. Below the four floors are the professors, and the professors are further divided into six grades, actually having ten layers in total. The four walls are: the first is the Party Committee, the second is the School Committee, the third is the departmental affairs meeting, and the fourth is the core meeting of the teaching and research section. These four walls are kept secret layer by layer, and no information leaks out. As a professor, unless he or she also holds an administrative position, he or she knows nothing. How can this be called for opinions, how can this be called love for the school? Adopting such a confidentiality system and such working methods actually affects unity. These walls must be torn down and these floors must be broken through."

    Zhang Huai said that leaders are high above, middle-level cadres are busy with affairs, and we have nowhere to speak.

    Professor Zhang Huai said: "We professors have no opportunity to express our opinions. Leaders are high above, middle-level cadres are busy with affairs, and we have nowhere to speak. The school held a tea party in the North Campus last year, which was very good, not for the tea and snacks, but for the opportunity to talk about our own opinions. The president issued a notice stipulating the time to receive professors, which is well-intentioned, but still a formality. He has not yet understood the psychology of senior intellectuals. Most senior intellectuals inevitably have some old scholarly habits. It is okay to talk to friends, but they are unwilling to talk to leaders. To be honest, I am unwilling to wait in line for a reception. I hope the leaders will approach the masses in various ways. Vice-President He only talked to me once when he came to Normal University. I am not unconcerned about the school, it is not that I have no opinions, but I have no way to convey them."

    Hu Ming, Director of the Russian Department, said: "The bureaucracy of the school leaders is quite serious. The division of responsibilities between the school and the Party Committee is not clear. Since liberation, the school has been in a state of chaos. When a problem arises, it is pushed forward, pushed backward, pushed to the left, and pushed to the right, and no one is really responsible, and the problem cannot be solved. Many problems are handled by the school leaders by relying on reports, and if they cannot be solved, they resort to commandism. Sectarianism in the school is quite serious, which is manifested in the use and promotion of cadres, grading, salary assessment, and other issues." Yu Min, Associate Professor of the Chinese Department, said: "There are two contradictions between the leaders and the led in Normal University: 1. Lack of trust in the masses. 2. Leaders control the led too much. I have been studying ancient Chinese for twenty years, and I am willing to teach this course. Even if I cannot teach it, I am willing to study related issues in this field. However, the leadership insists that I am good at phonetics and wants me to conduct research in this field. Phonetics is a tool for studying ancient Chinese, just as mathematics is a tool for studying physics. To tell someone who studies physics that his mathematics is very good, he will feel insulted."

    Liao Taichu said that non-Party professors have four difficulties: difficulty in meeting leaders, difficulty in confiding, difficulty in understanding Party members, and difficulty in getting things done.

    Liao Taichu, a professor in the Education Department, talked about four difficulties that non-Party professors have in handling daily work: (1) Difficulty in meeting leaders. It often takes a lot of time to ask the leader for instructions on something. Once, he wanted to discuss a problem with Dean Ding Haochuan, but he didn't see him after three appointments. It wasn't until the fourth time that he saw him, but the meeting lasted less than ten minutes. This made him feel very cold. He said that until now, he has not found a chance to talk to President He and Dean Huang. He believes that he needs to talk to the leading comrades. The so-called "busy" on the leadership's part is worth a big question mark. (2) Difficulty in confiding. In the past, I always liked to chat with old friends about my sweet and sour feelings. However, now everyone has improved, and they are afraid that what they say will be bad and that people will put labels on them. With this worry, they dare not find someone to talk to. Sometimes I find Party members to confide in, but in the process of talking, I sincerely talk about my problems, while the other party only helps you analyze the problems and never talks about his problems. I talk ten sentences, and the other party cannot talk one sentence. (3) Difficulty in understanding Party members. Among the Party members, there are certainly those who are approachable with a spring breeze, but there are also those who are cold as frost and difficult to approach. You can't figure out the temper of such comrades, and you have concerns when talking to them. For example, some Party members like to give orders, insist on their own opinions, and are not willing to discuss problems with others. It seems that these Party members believe that they are the ones who educate and transform people; while non-Party people are the ones who are educated and transformed. He felt that this was a kind of sectarianism of Party members, because the Party did not educate Party members to detach themselves from the masses. (4) Difficulty in getting things done. It takes a lot of time to spend on requests and writing reports, and it is delayed for a long time without being resolved.

    Ye Cangcen said that the leadership has two attitudes toward Party members and the masses in the rating problem.

    In their speeches, the professors raised many opinions on the issue of rating and salary assessment. Why are professors divided into six grades? What exactly is the basis for the level of grades? Many professors have opinions on these issues, and they believe that dividing them into so many grades is not good, but affects the unity among professors, and even good friends have hurt feelings over the grade issue. Due to the division of professors into many levels, there are many opinions. Ye Cangcen, a professor in the Chinese Department, believes that in the issue of rating, the leadership has two attitudes toward Party members and the masses. For example, a Party member professor who was sent to Hungary to study was promoted every time he was rated, and even promoted two grades; while some professors who have done a very good job were rated very low and were not noticed for promotion. He had raised several opinions about a professor surnamed Gao whose grade was rated too low, but they were not adopted. Some professors believe that the rating should be done openly, and should not be kept secret from some people. For example, some first- and second-level professors are said to have been designated by the Ministry of Education. Since they have already been designated, why bother to rate them again.

    Yin Zuying said that the masses reach out, but the Party members do not take it.

    Party members should integrate with the masses in all aspects of thought, work, and life. Many professors have this opinion. Fang Sihao, director of the Physics Department, said that in general, it looks good on the surface, but there is indeed an invisible wall. Many things are not done by soliciting the opinions of teachers in advance, but by making decisions within the Party first, and then taking them out. Party member teaching assistants speak very seriously with veteran teachers. Some people say, "I have to be silent for a period of time before I can transform." Some people, when they meet, say, "The weather is good today" or "How are these two editorials." Zhang Herui, director of the Mathematics Department, said: "I feel that young Party members are becoming more and more serious. The original lively ones have also become serious. I don't know why the increase in Party members' party membership will make them more and more serious." Chen Zhaoxi, Associate Professor of the Biology Department, said: "Party members' attitudes are too cautious. Party members' speeches do not add or detract from some issues, which will make the masses suspect that there is something wrong with them. Originally, there was no contradiction, but a contradiction was formed." Professor Dong Weichuan said: "The Party and the leaders only grasp some specific things, which results in the separation of Party and government. The leaders are busy with affairs and become hard-working bureaucrats." In the school, I hear the title of "school leader" and have to build a "leader's residential area" and "senior cadre dormitory," which is very offensive to hear. What will the masses think when they live there? Professor Mao Lirui said that doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and the masses can mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction. Yin Zuying, Professor of the Geography Department, said: "It is not easy to do a good job in unity, and now it is tending to unite. It is impossible for Party members to take the initiative to reach out, but the masses do not take it. It is often the masses who reach out, but the Party members do not take it."

    Zhao Qinghuan said that the Ministry of Education does things that are laughable and absurd.

    In their speeches, some professors criticized the bureaucratic work style of the Ministry of Education. Zhao Qinghuan, a professor of Cartography, said that the Ministry of Education cannot but bear certain responsibilities for the problems in the school today. Many things done by the Ministry of Education are really laughable and absurd. For example, the cartography class can be said to be a stroke of genius. A lot of people were mobilized, and some flew to Beijing to study for a month, but as soon as everyone went back, they received a notice from the Ministry of Education saying that the cartography class would not be offered. However, the director had said at the meeting that "the cartography class is currently needed, and the future is promising." Such a change is not laughable and absurd! Zuo Xueli, a professor in the Education Department, also revealed another incident. In the past, the Ministry of Education had asked her to translate an English book on psychology. At that time, the Ministry of Education limited her to complete the translation in three months. It would have taken half a year to translate, but she worked overtime and completed it on schedule. However, after the translation was sent to the Ministry of Education, there was no news for a long time. Later, it was learned that the Ministry of Education had lost the translation. In her speech, she said that the Ministry of Education must find the translation and return it to her.

    Chen Jingpan said that the official atmosphere is strong, and the academic atmosphere is thin.

    Some professors believe that Normal University has a tendency for the official atmosphere to overwhelm the academic atmosphere. The official atmosphere in the school is strong, while the academic atmosphere is weak. Chen Jingpan, a professor in the Education Department, said: "Normal University is an academic institution and should have an atmosphere of academic research, but on the contrary, judging from the articles published by professors, it makes people feel that there is less academic air and more official air. Comrades in charge of administrative leadership put administration first. Calculating their working hours, you can see that they spend very little time in teaching. Taking scientific research as an example, it seems that scientific research is to serve administration, not administration to serve scientific research. The Ministry of Education focuses on filling out forms, and professors also conduct scientific research in order to catch up with tasks and fill out forms. I am also in this situation. I have not seized the opportunity to conduct research on dissenting opinions in scientific research." Qi Gong, a professor in the Chinese Department, also believes that the academic atmosphere in Normal University is not strong. He suggested strengthening the leadership in this area. He said that the books in the library should be opened and not left there unused, otherwise it will affect the scientific advance.

### 改进党群关系　办好师范大学  教授们积极提出意见帮助党组织整风

    改进党群关系　办好师范大学
    教授们积极提出意见帮助党组织整风
    本报讯　中共北京师范大学委员会于10、13、14、15四日内，分别邀请中文、教育、俄语、历史等系的教授、副教授座谈。教授们对于学校党的领导工作提出了批评和建议。
    胡明说，党员有特殊的优越感，个别党员采取粗暴方式维持“威信”。
    北京师范大学的党和群众的关系怎样呢？许多教授对这个问题很关心。俄语系主任胡明教授说：现在我校的主要矛盾是党和群众的关系不好，而主要矛盾的主要方面是党员和党的组织。有的党员有特殊的优越感，看不起一般群众，因而脱离群众。有人总说群众自卑，其实群众并不自卑，是因为党员有特殊的优越感，夸大自己的作用、功劳，使群众相对的自卑了。更严重的是个别党员采取粗暴的方式维持“威信”，在群众中影响极坏。
    中文系李长之教授说：“师大的党组织和群众之间的墙是很厚的，像钢骨水泥一样坚固，这个墙如果不拆，有愈来愈厚的危险。”“人之相知，贵相知心”，本来群众很愿意和党员作知心朋友，可是党员没有这种表示。党员的作风确实影响党群关系，但群众往往通过个别党员与党建立感情，师大很多青年共产党员没有经过同群众共甘苦的锻炼，不少高级知识分子入党后反而脱离群众，成了当权派，不虚心听取群众的意见，喜欢摆出教育人的姿态，容易使人产生反感。
    政教专业何廷杰教授说：现在都说党群间有墙，这种提法有问题，不是党与群众间有墙，而是一些基层党组织、党员和群众间有墙。个别人留在墙外不要紧，墙外人多了对社会主义建设不利。这墙是谁造成？有人说是双方面：一方面是自卑感，这个墙一碰就破，另一方面是优越感，这是三合土加上电网，还通上电流的墙，好在现在是没连成一片，否则就太危险了。
    朱智贤教授说：党群关系问题主要是党和老教师的关系问题，行政负责人看起来比教学人员重要。在学校里，教学要依靠教学人员，特别是依靠老教师的思想是不明确的。解放后形成一种风气，太看重新教师，党对老教师支持不够，青年同志中有一股歪风，有些对领导、对党员很服从，这当然很好，但对老教师、对群众都不够尊敬重视。有些年青同志入党前很谦虚，入党后就不同了，“养不教，父之过”，党应给他们以教育。
    邵鹤亭教授说：希望党组织慎重考虑各种联系群众的新方式。他建议党除掉通过民主党派联系群众外，应当充分通过工会组织，把一切问题向群众开门，把群众当作自己人看待，填平党与群众间的鸿沟，使每个人都有主人翁的态度。
    邰爽秋说，教授是处在四层楼板下面和四道围墙外面。
    学校如何广泛吸收教授的意见？怎样扩大教授同各方面的联系？邰爽秋教授说：教授在学校里，是处在四层楼板下面和四道围墙外面，这四层楼的最顶层是校长，其次是教务长、研究部主任等，再下一层是系主任，还有一层是教研组主任，四层楼下才是教授，而教授又分六级，实际上有十层之多；四道围墙：第一道是党委会，第二道是校委会，第三道是系务会议，第四道是教研组的核心会，这四道城墙层层保密，水泄不通。作为一个教授除非兼任行政职务，什么事情都不知道，这叫人怎么能提出意见，怎么能对学校热爱呢？采取这样保密制度和这样的工作方法，实际上却是影响了团结。必须拆掉这些墙，打通这些楼板。
    张怀说，领导高高在上，中层干部忙于事务，我们有话无处说。
    张怀教授说：我们教授的意见没有发表的机会，领导高高在上，中层干部忙于事务，我们有话无处说。去年学校在北校举行过茶话会，这很好，倒不是为了吃茶点，而是有机会谈出自己的意见。校长出布告规定接见教授时间，用心固然好，但仍然是形式，还没有了解到高级知识分子的心理，高级知识分子大多数都难免有些旧的书生脾气，找朋友谈天可以，找领导就不愿意。老实说我就不愿意排队等接见。希望领导通过各种方式接近群众。何副校长只在到师大来时找我谈过一次话。我对学校不是不关心，不是没有意见，是有意见无从上达。
    俄语系胡明主任说：学校领导的官僚主义相当严重。学校、党委各部门职责分工不明确，自解放至今学校还是混乱状态。一个问题来了推前、推后、推左、推右无人真正负责，问题不能解决。许多问题校领导都是以耳代目，凭听汇报办事，办不通就命令主义。学校宗派主义相当严重，在使用、提拔干部、评级评薪等问题上都表现出来。中文系副教授俞敏说：师大领导者与被领导者的矛盾有二：一、不信任群众。二、领导对被领导管的太多。我研究古汉语二十年，我愿意教这门课，即使不能教我也愿意研究有关这方面的问题，但领导上硬说我擅长语音，要我在这方面进行研究。语音是研究古汉语的工具，正如数学是研究物理的工具一样，对一个学物理的人说他数学很好，他会感到受了侮辱。
    廖泰初说，非党教授有四个难处：会见领导难，谈心难，对党员了解难，办事难。
    教育系教授廖泰初谈到非党教授在处理日常工作中有四个难处：（一）会见领导难。向领导请示一件事往往要花费很多时间，有一次他想和丁浩川教务长商量一个问题，约了三次都没见到，直到第四次才见到，但见面谈话却不到十分钟。这件事使他很寒心。他说，直到现在，他连和何校长、黄教务长谈一次话的机会都没找到。他认为，需要和领导同志谈谈。领导上的所谓“忙”，值得打个大问号。（二）谈心难。过去自己有些甜酸苦辣的心事总喜欢找老朋友们扯扯。但是，现在大家都提高了，怕自己谈出的东西不好，人家会不会扣帽子，有了这种顾虑，就不敢找人谈。有时找到党员同志谈心，但在谈的过程中，自己倒是诚心谈自己的问题，而对方只是帮助你分析分析问题，从不谈他的问题。自己谈十句话，对方谈不了一句话。（三）对党员了解难。党员中春风满面的比较好接近的固然有，但冷若冰霜，不好接近的也不少，这样的同志摸不着他的脾气，和他谈话就有顾虑。例如，党员中有个别同志好下命令、坚持己见，不大愿意和人商量问题。看来这些党员认为他们就是教育人、改造人的；而非党人士则是被教育、被改造的。他觉得这是党员的一种宗派主义情绪，因为党并没有教育党员去脱离群众。（四）办事难。办个事情要花费很多时间用在请求、写报告上面，而且拖拖拉拉，长期之内得不到解决。
    叶苍岑说，领导上在评级问题中对待党员和群众有两种态度
    教授们在发言中，对评级评薪问题提出了很多意见。为什么把教授分成六个级？级别的高低到底根据什么？对这些问题，不少教授有意见，并且认为分成这么多的级没有好处，反而影响了教授之间的团结，甚至连好朋友也为了级别问题，伤了感情。由于教授中分成很多等级，意见很多。中文系教授叶苍岑认为在评级问题上，领导上对待党员和群众有两种态度，如一个派去匈牙利学习的党员教授每次评级都提升，甚至还提升两级；而对某些工作成绩很好的教授却评得很低，不注意提拔。他就曾经为一个姓高的教授的级别评得太低而提过几次意见，但都未被采纳。有些教授认为评级就应公开地评，不应对某些人保密。如有些一、二级的教授据说是教育部指定的，既然已经指定，何必再评。
    殷祖英说，群众伸出手来党员不接
    党员应该在思想、工作、生活各个方面和群众打成一片，许多教授都有这样意见。物理系主任方嗣?教授说，一般从表面上看还好，但确实有一堵无形的墙，有许多事情不是事先征求教师的意见，而是先在党内作决定，而后再拿出来。党员助教和老教师谈话很严肃。有的人说“我得沉默一个时期，才能转变过来。”有的人见面不是说“今天天气好”就是“这两篇社论如何如何”。数学系主任张禾瑞说：我感觉青年党员越来越严肃了，原来活泼的也变严肃了，我不知道为什么党员党龄的增长，会使他们越来越严肃。生物系陈昭熙副教授说：党员的态度过于谨慎，党员说话对一些问题不加可否，就会使群众怀疑其中有什么问题。本来无矛盾，也就形成了矛盾。董渭川教授说：党和领导只抓些具体事情，结果使党政不分，领导忙于事务，成了辛辛苦苦的官僚主义。在学校听到有“校首长”的称呼，还要盖什么“首长住宅区”、“高级干部宿舍”等，听了叫人多刺耳，住到那里群众会怎么看呢？毛礼锐教授说，搞好党群关系，可以调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务。地理系殷祖英教授说：搞好团结不容易，现在趋向团结了。党员主动伸出手来，群众不接是没有的，往往是群众伸出手来党员不接。
    赵擎寰说，教育部办事令人啼笑皆非
    有些教授在发言中对教育部的官僚主义作风提出批评。制图专业教授赵擎寰说，学校今天有问题，教育部不能不负一定责任。教育部办的许多事，真令人啼笑皆非。例如对制图课，可说是灵机一动，调集了许多人，有的坐飞机赶到北京学了一个月，但大家刚回去，却又接到教育部的通知说不开制图课了。而司长曾在会上对大家说过 “制图课目前是需要的，前途是大有可为的”，这样变化多端，可不令人啼笑皆非！教育系教授左学礼还揭发了另一件事情。过去教育部曾经要她翻译一本有关心理学的英文著作。当时教育部限定她三个月译完，本来需要半年时间才能译出，她加班加点如期完成了。但这本译著送到教育部之后，长期没有音讯。后来知道教育部将这本译著丢失了。她在发言中表示，教育部一定要将译稿找到退给她。
    陈景盘说，官僚气浓，学术气薄
    有的教授认为师范大学有官僚气压倒学术气的倾向，校内官僚气氛浓厚，而学术气氛淡薄。教育系陈景盘教授说：师大是个学术机关，应该有研究学术的空气，但相反，从教授发表的文章来看，使人感到学气少，官气大。负责行政领导的同志就是把行政放在第一位，替他们计算一下工作时间，就可看到他们在教学方面花费时间很少。拿科学研究来说，似乎科学研究是为行政服务，而不是行政为科学研究服务。教育部注重的是填表，教授进行科学研究也是为了赶任务、填表，我自己也是这种情况，对于科学研究方面的分歧意见却没有抓紧进行研究。中文系启功教授也认为师大的学术空气不浓，他建议加强对这方面的领导。他说图书馆的书应打开箱子，不要搁在那里不利用，否则影响科学进军。
