　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: Soviet authorities are mobilizing the strength of the broad masses to collect materials about the October Revolution.

　　The Moscow Revolution Museum recently organized a committee composed entirely of old revolutionaries. This committee is establishing contact with participants of the October Revolution and compiling and reviewing various memoirs.

　　The practice of mobilizing the broad masses to collect materials about the October Revolution was put forward by some old Bolsheviks in an open letter recently written to "Literary Gazette." They also suggested establishing a committee to compile the history of the October Revolution and the Civil War.

　　This proposal has received widespread attention in various localities. "Literary Gazette" has published a batch of writers' opinions, who proposed that the Writers Association should take on this work first. At the same time, old Bolsheviks in some regions have held special meetings to discuss how to assist in this work. Old Bolsheviks in Western Ukraine have already begun to write a substantial memoir.

    回忆当年事　编纂革命史
    苏联老革命者组成委员会
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联有关机关正在发动广大群众的力量来搜集关于十月革命的资料。
    莫斯科革命博物馆最近组织了一个完全由老革命者参加的委员会，这个委员会正在和十月革命的参加者建立联系，编纂和审订各种回忆录。
    发动广大群众搜集关于十月革命的资料的作法，是一些老布尔什维克在最近写给“文学报”的一封公开信里提出来的。他们还建议成立编纂十月革命和内战史的委员会。
    这项提议得到了各地的普遍重视。“文学报”曾经刊载了一批作家的意见，他们提出作家协会应该首先担负这项工作。和这同时，一些地区的老布尔什维克们举行了专门会议，讨论如何协助这项工作。西乌克兰的老布尔什维克们已经着手编写一部内容充实的回忆录。
