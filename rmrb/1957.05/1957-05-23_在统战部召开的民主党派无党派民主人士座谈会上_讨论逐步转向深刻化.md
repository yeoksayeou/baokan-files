At Symposium of Democratic Parties and Non-Party Democratic Personages Held by the United Front Work Department
    Discussion Gradually Turns Deeper

    (Our dispatch) The symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, inviting responsible persons from the central committees of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, has been held nine times up to the 22nd, with a total of fifty-two people making speeches and written statements. These statements, from different positions and viewpoints, put forward various different opinions and suggestions on the work of the Party and the state. On some issues, debates also unfolded at the meeting. In these opinions, a considerable portion touches on issues of principle in the work of the state. Studying, analyzing, and discussing these opinions seriously, and treating them correctly, in order to improve our work and raise our ideological awareness, is extremely important for every Communist Party member and reader.

    The meeting adjourned on the 23rd. Those who spoke at the meeting on the 22nd included Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Chen Shaoxian and Wang Kunlun, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Wang Shaoxiao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Ye Duyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Yan Jingyao, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League; and Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    Zhou Jianren Agrees that "Dismantling the Wall" Must Be Done from Both Sides

    He Believes that the Ingenious Method of "Dismantling the Wall" is for Democratic Personages to Strive to Study and Understand Ideology

    Deficiencies Should Be Estimated Objectively and Realistically

    Exaggerating Deficiencies Easily Leads to Ideological Confusion

    Zhou Jianren, the first to speak today, first expressed his views on achievements and shortcomings. He said that since the liberation of China, in just a few years, the Communist Party of China has done many things, and shortcomings are certainly present; it is unimaginable to have only achievements and no shortcomings. Shortcomings need to be exposed in order to find ways to correct them, but they should not be exaggerated excessively. I very much agree with what Comrade Li Yi said yesterday: Deficiencies should be estimated objectively and realistically; exaggerating deficiencies easily leads to ideological confusion.

    Next, he talked about the working methods of Party organizations in government agencies. He said that the Communist Party is the leading party, and the construction of socialism must have the leadership of a Marxist party, which the people of the whole country already know very clearly today. However, some Party organizations in government agencies are managing too many things. Because the Party manages too much, the opportunity for non-Party cadres to give play to their initiative and wisdom will be reduced somewhat, which is not conducive to work. If they manage less and let go more, it will be beneficial and can enable non-Party cadres to study hard and be responsible for doing their work well, which is beneficial to socialist construction. This does not mean that the leadership of the Party is not needed, or that what must be managed is not managed; the leadership of the Party is definitely necessary, and no one doubts that.

    Of course, subjectivism will exist in government agency work. Considering and deciding on a matter will of course contain some degree of subjectivism; pure objectivity without any subjective component is rarely possible. However, if one does not think carefully and is too one-sided or unsuitable for the current reality, it becomes a subjective view, which is also very damaging to work, so it should be overcome.

    Regarding united front work, Zhou Jianren said: There are now two popular phrases: "Unite the left but not the right" and "Unite the top but not the bottom." I don't see "uniting the left but not the right," because whether at the central or local level, it is clear that people who are relatively old and somewhat right-leaning in their thinking are also united; I don't feel that there is a matter of not uniting the right. As for "uniting the top but not the bottom," it appears to exist to some extent. For example, when the United Front Work Department has something to discuss with democratic parties, it generally always seeks out the responsible persons of the democratic parties to talk to, and never seeks out grassroots members, which seems to be somewhat "uniting the top but not the bottom." However, it is also impossible in reality to bring all the members of grassroots organizations together. I believe that this phenomenon is also related to the fact that the internal work of the democratic parties is not done well. For example, responsible persons within the CAPD rarely communicate with the grassroots, and I myself rarely contact members of grassroots organizations, so there is some separation. Because the responsible persons of the democratic parties do not communicate much with the grassroots, there is some separation, and the bottom will think that the United Front Work Department is "uniting the top but not the bottom." If the democratic parties have very good internal communication, this situation can be reduced somewhat.

    He Believes it is Acceptable to Describe the Thorough Transformation of Bourgeois Elements as "Rebirth"

    Speaking of ideological education, Zhou Jianren said, I feel that everyone, regardless of their class of birth, family circumstances, and experiences in life, the quality of their work is always related to the thoughts in their minds. All actions can be traced back to an ideological source. Any action, whether it is done or not done, or how it is done, must go through thought and be determined by thought. Therefore, learning is very necessary. The scope of learning is very broad, and ideological learning refers to ideological education. The purpose is to transform thought. Transforming thought can be called brainwashing or changing the brain, and it is also acceptable to call it rebirth. We come from the old society and inevitably carry the old ideological system. It is not strange to carry the old ideological system; it would be very strange if we didn't bring any of it. Intellectuals from the petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie must undergo arduous ideological transformation to become intellectuals with proletarian consciousness. The petty bourgeoisie belongs to the category of the bourgeoisie, but the ideology of the former class differs from the ideology of the latter class. The desire for enjoyment of the petty bourgeoisie is smaller than that of the bourgeoisie, and the idea of exploitation is less or even non-existent. Because bourgeois elements originally have the characteristics of the idea of exploitation, and the desire for enjoyment is also great, the transformation is a larger project than that of the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, I think that is the reason why the thorough transformation of bourgeois elements is likened to "rebirth."

    Regarding the question of how to dismantle the wall, Zhou Jianren said that Mr. Wang Shao'ao believes that dismantling the wall must be done from both sides. I agree with his view. I think that for a member of a democratic party, striving to study and understand ideology is the ingenious method of dismantling the wall. I believe that without good unity in thought, unity will always be superficial. He also said that studying and transforming is not the only or omnipotent method. For example, getting close to the worker-peasant masses, participating in physical labor, etc., can all influence thought and cause it to change. However, it must be said that learning has a very great effect. However, the magnitude of the effect depends on the learner's degree of willingness. Furthermore, even under voluntary circumstances, transforming thought is still an arduous task. However, although the work is arduous, its usefulness is extremely great. For example, if a cadre managing general affairs or financial work has already transformed his thinking into that of the working class, already understands Marxism-Leninism, and already has a considerable understanding of the socialist future, compared with someone who has not been transformed and is accustomed to being a bookkeeper for wealthy families in the old society, the work style and work results will definitely be very different. To build socialism rapidly and smoothly, I think transforming thought is very necessary!

    He Explained that the Issue of Writing Reform Has a Long History and that Opinions Have Been Widely Solicited from the Masses Since Liberation

    Finally, Zhou Jianren talked about the issue of writing reform, which was hotly debated at the meeting the day before. He said that hearing everyone talk about the issue of writing reform, I am very interested in it and would like to explain some of the situation. Many people raised the issue of writing reform before liberation. After liberation, Beijing held a conference of the literary world (the name of the conference has been forgotten) and put forward a suggestion. Later, a committee for the study of writing reform was established, chaired by Elder Wu (Wu Yuzhang), and I also signed it. And I heard that Elder Ma (Ma Xulun), Elder Guo (Guo Moruo), and Minister Shen Yanbing all discussed this issue with Chairman Mao. When the simplified Chinese character scheme came out, I was working at the Publishing Administration. I heard that 200,000 copies were distributed to solicit opinions from all over the country in 1955. Last year, it was also submitted to local CPPCCs for discussion. In fact, the issue of simplified Chinese characters has long existed in the minds of the people. I remember when I was working at the Commercial Press, someone raised it.

    As for the pinyin scheme, Elder Wu made a report, which was only for phonetic notation, for promoting Mandarin and facilitating literacy, and did not propose replacing Chinese characters. The requirement for phonetic notation has also existed for a long time, and some people proposed it in the early years of the Republic of China. Whether pinyin letters will become a universal script in the future is a matter for the future. However, Mr. Lu Xun had advocated using pinyin script early on, because it could promote cultural development. No one opposed him at the time, because Lu Xun himself had read many ancient books, and others could not seize on this point to criticize him (others had raised it and been opposed). Today, there are certainly people among the masses who support the use of pinyin script, and I am one of them. However, it is not to abolish Chinese characters. Chinese characters can still be learned, ancient books can still be read, and Chinese characters will not be abolished. I think this is possible in the future, because pinyin script is really very convenient. Finally, I would like to explain one more sentence, but Elder Wu's report did not propose this.

    Chen Shaoxian Hopes that the Communist Party Will Help Democratic Parties Transform Their Thinking

    He Says: Since We Want Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision, We Cannot Use Old Ideas and Backward Ideas to Supervise New and Progressive Ideas, Nor Can We Use Capitalism to Supervise Socialism.

    What exactly was the relationship between the Central United Front Work Department and the democratic parties in the past? Is the assistance to the democratic parties sufficient? Chen Shaoxian first answered these two questions in his speech. He said that there were no mistakes in the relationship between the United Front Work Department and the democratic parties in the past. The consolidation and development of the democratic parties and the progress of the members of the democratic parties are inseparable from the assistance of the United Front Work Department. In the past few years, the United Front Work Department invited the leaders of the RCCK to study and discuss all issues related to the RCCK, which was of great help to the RCCK. Comrades from the United Front Work Department also often went to the RCCK and had personal contact with us, talking about our opinions on work and life. These practices were all very good. However, in the past year, in order to avoid interfering in the internal affairs of the democratic parties, the United Front Work Department has provided less assistance to us, and the relationship has become more distant. I believe that asking the United Front Work Department for assistance and instructions when there are problems within the democratic parties is not equivalent to interfering in internal affairs. Therefore, today I want to make a few suggestions to the United Front Work Department. First of all, I hope that the United Front Work Department will still guide and help with the ideological transformation work of the democratic parties. Because since we want "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," we cannot use old ideas and backward ideas to supervise new and progressive ideas, nor can we use capitalism to supervise socialism. Only when ideological transformation is done well can we achieve "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Of course, to achieve this, the Communist Party must also overcome the three major styles.

    Chen Shaoxian also hopes that the United Front Work Department can help solve problems that the democratic parties cannot solve, such as housing problems and personnel problems.

    Chen Shaoxian's third hope for the United Front Work Department is that, to the extent possible, the United Front Work Department can solicit the opinions of the democratic parties in advance before formulating important policies and measures of the Party and the government. He said that the democratic parties often only know about some things after they are published in the newspaper. How can we supervise if we don't understand the situation in advance? Soliciting opinions in advance will enable the democratic parties to play a supervisory role. Of course, issues belonging to the confidential aspects are another matter.

    Finally, Chen Shaoxian hopes that the United Front Work Department can maintain close contact with the democratic parties (including personal contact), have more contact and communication with everyone, and not become increasingly distant due to fear of interfering in internal affairs.

    In addition to the four hopes for the United Front Work Department, Chen Shaoxian also talked about the three major styles. He said that the three major styles are interrelated, but the most harmful is bureaucracy. Because bureaucracy involves the widest scope and is related to the people of the whole country. If bureaucracy is serious in factories and rural areas, it will arouse dissatisfaction among workers and farmers. The same is true in other aspects. To do our work well and prevent the expansion of contradictions among the people, we must expand democratic life and overcome bureaucracy. Overcoming bureaucracy will enable our regime to be constantly consolidated.

    Next, he talked about sectarianism. He said that the harm of sectarianism is also not small. Although the Communist Party has always hated sectarianism and opposed it in Yan'an, it is still opposing it today, but sectarian emotions among cadres are still not uncommon. Some people look down on democratic personages and act arbitrarily, which easily leads to bureaucracy and subjectivism. Many of the problems that occurred last year were caused by bureaucracy. If the relevant departments could have carefully studied the situation in advance and studied it with the democratic parties, much loss could have been avoided.

    Not only do we not understand some of the things that have been revealed in the newspapers recently, but I think the CPC Central Committee may not know about them either. Now that they are being revealed, it will help resolve the contradictions, and we should all contribute our strength to correctly handling the contradictions among the people.

    Wang Kunlun Proposes Three Hopes

    Support Democratic Parties in Fully Participating in National Affairs

    The Communist Party Should Continue to Help the RCCK Unite and Make Progress

    Cross-Party Members in the RCCK Should Actively Play a Role

    Wang Kunlun put forward three hopes in his speech, saying: These are his personal opinions, but they also reflect the opinions of some members of the RCCK.

    The first hope is to support democratic parties in fully participating in national affairs. In the past, the RCCK and various democratic parties participated in national affairs, but it was not sufficient. I hope that in the future, for all major national plans within the scope of the Constitution, not only should we make suggestions in advance and criticize afterwards, but we should also participate in the decision-making, implementation, and inspection within their own powers. Most of the members of the RCCK are military and political personnel, and most of them are now doing political work in state organs. Perhaps they cannot release many beautiful flowers in literature and art, and perhaps they cannot make a splash in academics, but they should give more play to their strength in political work, jointly take responsibility, be masters of their own affairs, and build a socialist country together.

    On this issue, Wang Kunlun stated: Although we put forward many opinions and point out many shortcomings, the purpose is to demand the expansion of socialist democracy. An old comrade of the RCCK said: "If the idea of confrontation is developed excessively, or even shakes the understanding of the Communist Party as the core of leadership, it is by no means a blessing for the country." This sentence shows that although we more or less retain the bourgeois democratic political thought, we are determined to take the socialist road. Although we want to sing a duet, we do not want the parliamentary politics of capitalist countries. We are a multi-party coalition government led by the Communist Party, and the democratic parties are not opposition parties in opposition. We also have some responsibility for the shortcomings in the work of the country. Only with such a position and viewpoint can we fully participate in national affairs, supervise and criticize the leading party.

    Speaking of this, Wang Kunlun incidentally raised several specific issues. The first issue is that those in office can achieve having a position, power, and responsibility, and play a role. The second issue is that military and political personnel and general social figures without positions can be appropriately arranged and employed and given relief according to their respective circumstances. The third issue is that the cadres of the RCCK's own organs should first of all be given more care and training so that they can give play to their strength and work with peace of mind. However, if the material conditions are insufficient, we still hope that the government will provide possible assistance in the future. The fourth issue is that, on the one hand, we adhere to the principle of investigating and dealing with all counter-revolutionaries in the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries, and on the other hand, we adhere to the principle of correcting all mistakes. I hope to conduct in-depth inspection. Wherever someone has been wrongly dealt with, after clarifying the situation, we will publicly restore his reputation there. However, in terms of organization and ideology, we must of course adhere to the principle of drawing a clear distinction between ourselves and the enemy. If they are indeed counter-revolutionaries, we will never call for them, and we will never ask for their rehabilitation.

    The second hope is that the Communist Party will continue to help the RCCK unite and make progress, and help the RCCK play a leading role among the masses it is connected with. Many of the comrades of the RCCK accepted the leadership and influence of the Communist Party before liberation, and only then could they concentrate their strength from long-term dispersion and failure and move towards victory. After liberation, the RCCK, the Democratic League, the CAPD, and the four aspects of the Fourth Front Army merged into today's RCCK. In recent years, the organization has become increasingly consolidated and developed. In the past year alone, the number of people has more than doubled, and the number of social figures connected with them has reached more than 25,000. Internally, they have almost forgotten the historical traces of the past four aspects, and they are united. Basically, it is almost impossible to find sectarianism and opposition. He said that the development and consolidation of the RCCK over the past few years are inseparable from the consistent assistance of the United Front Work Department. We cannot forget how the United Front Work Department created conditions for the development of the RCCK in the past few years and how it assisted our unity and progress from the sidelines. I hope that in the future, the United Front Work Department will strengthen political leadership over the RCCK as much as possible under the principle of not interfering in the internal affairs of the RCCK.

    However, Wang Kunlun said: Of course, we cannot ignore our own efforts. For example, there are still some individual cases of disunity in our local organizations in recent years, which mainly rely on our own criticism and self-criticism, and mainly rely on the RCCK Central Committee to help them adjust their relationships. It is useless to simply blame the local United Front Work Department. In the future, the RCCK, as an organization of a democratic party, should still take the lead among the masses it is connected with, and always play a leading role, representing the interests of the masses it is connected with, and helping them transform their thinking. Only in this way can we create conditions for long-term coexistence. In this way, we can naturally prolong our lives and have an optimistic future. It will not be warm and cold, and the flowers will bloom and fall again, but it will be a breeze and a long day, with fragrant grass connecting the sky.

    The third hope is that the cross-party members in the RCCK organization will actively play a role. He said: The number of Communist Party members and Youth League members who have joined the RCCK is very small, but there are many in the central government and in many places. Among them, there are also some individuals who show some different shortcomings, but on the whole, they are conscientious and diligent, and have played an active role in unity. Wang Kunlun believes that since these Party and League members have joined the RCCK organization, before withdrawing from the RCCK, on the one hand, they must of course abide by the principles and discipline of the Party and League, not get involved in personnel disputes, and not be superior to others just because they are Party and League members, but on the other hand, they should not be too cautious and shrink back. They should be open-minded and give play to their active role as members of the RCCK. Communist Party members and League members should be good at cooperating and working with RCCK comrades, and RCCK members should learn from Party members and League members and improve the cooperative working relationship.

    Wang Shao'ao believes that the wall was built on both sides and should also be dismantled on both sides, helping the Communist Party to rectify its work is to consolidate the country's leadership core.

    Wang Shao'ao said in his speech: I said in my last speech that the wall was built on both sides and should also be dismantled by both sides. For example, I myself have this problem. We intellectuals who come from the old society often think highly of ourselves and emphasize "a scholar dies for his confidant," which is one of the sources of the wall. When I was working in the Ministry of Finance, I was not very willing to look for Minister Bo Yibo, and I did not pay him a New Year's visit during the New Year's and other festivals, so there was a gap between us, and this gap deepened. We should take the initiative to remove this kind of lofty thinking. "A scholar dies for his confidant" is the thought of feudal society.

    He said that now the treatment of senior intellectuals has been improved and their wages have increased, but this does not mean that senior intellectuals have become active. If they are not trusted, their enthusiasm will still not be aroused. As far as I know, nine out of ten old engineers in various factories and mines have this situation: if you don't trust me, why should I work hard?

    He said that our walls are of all kinds, there are walls of subjectivism, walls of bureaucracy, and especially serious walls of sectarianism, and these walls all have their own ways of being dismantled. Sectarianism is not balanced in all places, some places are heavier, and some places are lighter.

    According to the comrades of the Tianjin China Association for Promoting Democracy, our members there are very worried about "speaking out" and "letting go." I told the comrades of the Tianjin China Association for Promoting Democracy to rest assured that it is good to speak out and let go, as long as you stand firm on the socialist position and proceed from the desire for unity. We are doing this to help the Communist Party of China rectify its work, to consolidate our leadership core, so that the Communist Party of China will not make mistakes, or make fewer mistakes. I said last time that the democratic parties should also rectify their work, which had a great impact. Some people said that this is not allowing us to "speak out" and "let go." This shows that I am high above and do not understand the psychology of the masses.

    Some people say that the Soviet Union is a one-party dictatorship. I say no, the Soviet Union is a dictatorship of the proletariat. China is a people's democratic dictatorship, not a one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party. I want to contend, and I cannot agree with some people's proposal to abolish the Party committee system in schools. But the Party organization should not replace the administration. The system itself is not bad, but someone has undermined the system.

    Building socialism must have the leadership of the Communist Party, and all democratic parties must also be politically led by the Communist Party. This is a matter of course.

    Ye Duyi Hopes Not to Call
    Democratic Personages "Friends"

    Ye Duyi said that he wanted to talk about the issue of "dismantling the wall" from a small matter. He said that when Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou spoke, they often said "Comrades, friends," whether they were giving reports at the CPPCC or speaking to government agency cadres. Obviously, comrades refer to the Communist Party members present, and friends refer to the non-Party members present. He believes that the three words "friends" can be cancelled, because the members of the CPPCC are all within the united front, and the government agency cadres are all subordinates of Premier Zhou, so calling them friends is inaccurate. He said that the word "comrade" has two interpretations. One is within a party; without the same organizational relationship, they are not comrades. Another interpretation is that comrades are people with the same goals. He said, "The United States calls us fellow travelers of the Communist Party." I think that is very correct, because people in the united front all support the Communist Party and socialism. He said that a year ago, when the China Democratic League held its Second National Congress, Minister Li Weihan talked about calling the members of the China National Democratic Construction Association comrades, and the members of the China National Democratic Construction Association were very happy. Calling them comrades is because the enterprises were jointly operated by public and private sectors and there was a foundation. After a year, there have been greater changes in society. If the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee cancel the three words "friends" when they speak, it will be a great encouragement to non-Party members.

    Yan Jingyao Suggests: Merging Four Parties
    to Establish a "Socialist League"

    Yan Jingyao put forward three opinions in his speech. First, he hopes to strengthen the united front education for Party members. He said: Many grassroots comrades reflect that the two words "united front" of the United Front Work Department are split into "the top unites, the bottom fights." He said that some professors below are still afraid to speak out and let go because they have concerns. Some people reflect: universities speak out loudly, middle schools speak out moderately, and primary schools speak out softly. Some people also say: "We dare to contend in academics, but we dare not contend in ideology." Some middle school teachers reflect: "The 'big' ones and the 'small' ones are all managed, but we 'middle' ones are not." In Shanghai, someone said three sentences: "More implementation, less research; more orders, less consultation; more demands, less assistance." Speaking of this, Yan Jingyao gave an example: In one school, the Communist Party member vice-principal went on a business trip, and the school issued such a notice: "The vice-principal is away on official business, and the principal will act as his agent in all matters within the school." Based on the above situation, Yan Jingyao suggested that it is necessary to strengthen united front education below. In addition, Yan Jingyao also talked about: the united front work of some units below is done very well, because the Communist Party branches can discuss matters with the branches of the democratic parties, and play the role of the democratic parties.

    Yan Jingyao said: I am a member of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and I very much agree with Ye Duyi's opinion to combine the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Jiusan Society, and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Party. These four parties all do the work of intellectuals, and there are often crossovers, which makes it difficult for the masses to cope with, and they don't know which organization to join. Combining them is very beneficial to uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and it can also free up many people to do other things. If they can be merged, they can be called the "Socialist League."

    The second opinion is that the full-time cadres of the democratic parties do not belong to government agencies or enterprises, nor do they belong to the Party. There is no fixed system for their treatment, promotion, and training, and many people feel that the future is uncertain and they are not at ease. This deserves attention.

    The third opinion, he talked about measures to expand the democratic system. He said that the inspection work of the deputies to the National People's Congress and the members of the CPPCC has played a supervisory and promotive role in the work of the government, but it is not enough. Because the scope, time, and region of their inspection are limited. He suggested that various standing committees be established in the Central and local people's congresses at all levels, such as economic, health, and other committees, and that democratic party members, non-party members, experts, etc. be absorbed to participate in supervising the work of various departments.

    Luo Longji Doubts Whether Existing Party and Government Agencies Can Prevent and Correctly Handle Retaliation Incidents, He Advocates Establishing Another Self-Contained Committee

    Luo Longji said in his speech that recently two foreign reporters came to his home and asked him to talk about his impressions of "speaking out" and "letting go," especially his opinions on the speeches of Ma Yinchu and Zhang Xiruo. He said that he believes that this contention is very healthy. Although everyone has put forward many opinions, no one opposes Marxism and socialism. This is one. Second, "speaking out" and "letting go" are carried out under the leadership of the Party, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's instructions on rectification, focusing on criticizing the three styles. At the same time, he also told foreign reporters that he believed that Mr. Ma Yinchu had too many concerns. He disagreed with Ma Yinchu's opinion. He said that in the early days of liberation, many old professors could not teach, but after studying and improving, they can now teach. Ma Yinchu said that after the rectification movement, many young teaching assistants could not teach because they had too much dogmatism. But what is so scary about this! After the young teachers go through rectification, get rid of dogmatism, and improve themselves, they will make greater contributions to the country in the future. This is precisely the dialectical development, and this is precisely the role of rectification. He also did not fully agree with Zhang Xiruo's opinion.

    He said that the day before, Mr. Chen Shutong told him that the current atmosphere of contention is like "Spring sleep oblivious to the dawn, everywhere hearing birds sing." He added two sentences: "A piece of rectification sound, how much are the three evils removed?" He said that through this rectification, "the Party has been strengthened, and the democratic parties have also been improved."

    Second, he said that some people have proposed that the Party provide guarantees that they will not be retaliated against in the future after they criticize the Party. He believes that it is a joke to ask Chairman Mao to come out and guarantee this. But he put forward a specific plan to solve this problem, that is, the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference should establish a committee. This committee should not only check the deviations in the past Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Anti-Counter-Revolutionary movements, but it will also publicly declare that it encourages everyone to come and complain if they have any grievances. This committee includes the leading party, as well as democratic parties and people from all walks of life. He believes that there are three benefits to doing this: first, it can encourage everyone to put forward opinions, and intellectuals in various places will not worry that there is no place to speak, but that all roads lead to Beijing; second, although the past "Five-Anti," "Three-Anti," and "Anti-Counter-Revolutionary" movements have achieved great results, they have also had side effects, making people afraid to speak. Some people worry that after this "letting go" and "speaking out," there will be "tightening up" and "rectification." Those who have been wronged in past movements should be "rehabilitated," which can reduce their estrangement from the Party and the government. He also advocated that the "rehabilitation" agency must be separated from the original leadership agencies of the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Anti-Counter-Revolutionary" movements. Because he believes that these movements were led by the Communist Party in the past. In addition to the leading party, each democratic party and non-party member should also participate in the "rehabilitation" to explain the achievements of the movement and solve problems for those who have been wronged. Not only do the democratic parties have people who have been wronged, but in fact, there are also people within the Communist Party. Third, now no one can guarantee that there will be no retaliation incidents in lower-level agencies. With this agency, those who dare to retaliate will know what to fear; those who have been retaliated against will have a way to go, and they can file a complaint. He believes that this not only checks the legacy of the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign, but also cooperates with the rectification. Therefore, he also advocated that local people's congresses and CPPCCs should also establish committees of this nature to make it a system.

    He believes that the Communist Party organization has developed too fast

    Third, he believes that it is worth considering by the leading party whether the Communist Party has developed its organization too fast, especially in developing intellectuals. In the few years since liberation, the number of party members has quickly grown to 12 million. In his view, in the early days of liberation, there were some people among the intellectuals who often "attacked others and raised themselves," and such people, he said, were regarded by the Party as activists, that is, progressive elements, and were absorbed into the Party. Most of these people have not undergone years of revolutionary training, and lack the knowledge to fight against nature. "Once they have power in their hands, they issue orders," and non-Party intellectuals feel dissatisfied, which not only affects the Party's prestige, but also creates a gap between the Party and non-Party members.

    He believes that there are too many superiors, and the Ministry of Forestry Industry "has no way to have power"

    Fourth, regarding the issue of having a position without power. He believes that Party members certainly have responsibilities, but the organization also has problems. He said that he has a position and power in the Ministry of Forestry Industry, but there are eight offices of the State Council above the ministry, as well as the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission, and there are also various departments of the Party Central Committee, so your ministry has no way to have power. Many things are implemented from top to bottom, and tasks are assigned down. The figures and tasks that the Economic Commission and the Planning Commission ask the ministry for can only be subjective. The entire plan is built on the basis of closed-door subjectivism. He believes that the leaders of the Economic Commission and the Planning Commission and the various offices of the State Council are mostly Party members, which also shows that the Party does not trust old intellectuals very much. He believes that "although Party members have strong political skills, their technical knowledge and experience in economic planning are not necessarily rich," and old intellectuals should be allowed to participate in management work with confidence.

    1956 was "all-out rash advance"

    Fifth, regarding the current main bias in work, is it "conservatism" or "rash advance"? He believes that since 1956, it has mainly been rash advance, not conservatism. This is not the problem of that person, nor the problem of that department, but the problem of all-out rash advance. Mr. Zhang Xiruo's remarks about "being fond of the great and desiring success" and "being eager for quick success and instant benefits" are all talking about its manifestations. This is the result of forgetting Chairman Mao's words about "steady progress."

    Cai Tingkai Makes a Written Statement on Simplified Characters

    Cai Tingkai said in a written statement that today's newspaper reported that several comrades at yesterday's symposium talked a lot about the issue of writing reform, but I agree with 99% of the simplified characters that have been announced, and I have some small opinions. For example, in terms of semantic analysis, the word "葉" (leaf) is an appendage of a tree, so "葉" is changed to "叶". The word "簫" (Xiao) is a musical instrument, changed to the character "肖". I have received letters from many friends who have opinions, but the Writing Reform Committee has not clearly explained the words "叶" and "箫". I think that the masses have opinions, and I hope that the Writing Reform Committee will publicly explain them.

    在统战部召开的民主党派无党派民主人士座谈会上
    讨论逐步转向深刻化
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部邀请各民主党派中央负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会，到22日为止，已经开了九次，前后共有五十二人作了发言和书面发言。这些发言，从不同的立场和观点，对党和国家的工作提出了各种不同的见解和意见。对某些问题，会上还展开了争论。在这些意见里面，有不少一部分涉及到国家工作中带有原则性的问题。我们认真地研究、分析和讨论这些意见，加以正确地对待，以便改进我们的工作，提高我们的思想觉悟，这对于每一个共产党员和读者，都是十分重要的。
    会议23日休会。在22日会议上发言的有中国民主促进会副主席周建人，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员陈劭先、王昆仑，中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊，中国民主同盟中央副秘书长叶笃义，中国民主促进会中央常务委员严景耀，中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基，中国国民党革命委员会副主席蔡廷锴。
    周建人同意“拆墙”须从两面来拆
    他觉得民主人士努力学习搞通思想就是“拆墙”妙法
    应该实事求是地估计缺点
    夸大缺点易引起思想混乱
    周建人今天第一个发言，首先他表示了对成绩和缺点的看法。他说，中国解放以来，短短的几年中，中国共产党做了很多事情，缺点当然也是有的，光有成绩毫无缺点是不可想像的事情。缺点需要把他暴露出来，才能设法纠正，但也不宜过分夸大。我很赞成昨天李毅同志的话，应该实事求是地估计缺点，夸大缺点容易引起思想混乱。
    接着，他谈到机关党组织的工作方法问题。他说，共产党是领导党，建设社会主义必须有马克思主义的党作领导，今天全国人民已经知道得很清楚。不过，有些机关里的党组织事情管得过多了。因为党管得太多，党外干部发挥积极性和智慧的机会就会减少一些，对于工作不利。如果管得少些，放手一些，有好处，可以使党外干部努力学习，负责把工作做好，于社会主义建设才有利。这并不是不需要党的领导，并不是必须管的也不管，党的领导肯定要，谁也不怀疑。
    机关工作中主观主义当然会有的，考虑和决断一件事情，当然多少含有主观主义成份，毫无主观成份的纯客观是很少可能的。但如不细细思考，过于片面或不适合当前实际，就成为主观主义的看法，这在工作上的损害也是很大的，所以应该克服。
    关于统战工作方面，周建人说：现在流行着“统左不统右”和“统上不统下”二句话。统左不统右，我却看不出来，因为无论中央或地方，分明把年纪比较老的、思想多少有点右的人也团结在一起，我不觉得有不统右的事。至于统上不统下，表面上是有一些的，例如统战部有事与民主党派商量时，一般总是找民主党派的负责人来谈，从不找基层成员来谈，这好像有些统上不统下了。不过要把基层组织的成员都找来，事实上也不可能。我以为造成这种现象与民主党派内部工作做得不好也有关系。如民进内部负责人很少与基层通气，我自己就很少和基层组织成员联系，多少有些隔膜。因为民主党派负责人和基层不大通气，有些隔膜，下面就会以为是统战部“统上不统下”了。如果民主党派内部很通气，这种情况就可以减少些。
    把资产阶级分子的彻底改造说成“脱胎换骨”，他认为也无不可
    讲到思想教育的问题，周建人说，我感到每个人除出生的阶级、家庭情况及生活过程中的遭遇不论外，工作的好坏总与头脑里的思想有关联。各种行动都可以追溯出一个思想根源来。任何行动，做或不做，或怎么做，都须经过思想，由思想来决定。因此，学习就十分必要了。学习范围很广，思想上的学习就是指思想教育。目的就是改造思想。改造思想可称为洗脑筋或称为换脑筋，说脱胎换骨也无不可。我们是从旧社会来的，不免带有旧的思想体系。带有旧的思想体系倒没有什么奇怪，如果一点不带来倒是很奇怪了。出身于小资产阶级和资产阶级的知识分子，必须经过艰苦的思想改造，才能成为具有无产阶级意识的知识分子。小资产阶级是属于资产阶级的范畴，但前一阶级的思想与后一阶级的思想有差异。小资产阶级的享受欲比资产阶级小些，剥削思想也较少或竟无有。因为资产阶级分子本来具有剥削思想的特点，享受的欲望又大，所以改造起来，工程比小资产阶级要大些，因此，把资产阶级分子的彻底改造比喻为“脱胎换骨”，我想原因就在此。
    对于如何拆墙问题，周建人说，王绍鏊老先生认为，拆墙须从两面来拆，我同意他的看法，我觉得作为一个民主党派的成员来说，努力学习、搞通思想就是拆墙的妙法。我相信不从思想上来搞好团结，团结总是表面的。他又说，学习改造不是唯一的、万能的。例如接近工农群众、参加体力劳动等等都能影响思想，使之发生变化。但学习也不得不说有极大的作用。不过，作用的大小又须看学习者自愿的程度如何而定。进一步说起来，就是在自愿的情况下，改造思想也还是一件艰苦的工作。不过，工作虽然艰苦，用处却是极大。比方说，一个管理总务或是财务工作的干部，如果他的思想已经改造成为工人阶级，已经懂得马列主义，已经相当地了解社会主义前途，与一个未经过改造，习惯于旧社会里给富家当账房先生的人比较，其工作作风与工作效果，肯定是大不相同的。要把社会主义迅速顺利地建设起来，我觉得改造思想非常必要！
    他说明文字改革问题由来已久，解放后又曾广泛征求群众意见
    最后，周建人谈到前天会上争论得很热烈的文字改革问题。他说，听到大家谈到文字改革的问题，我对它很有兴趣，愿意说明一些情况。解放前许多人就提起过文字改革的问题；解放后，北京曾开过一个文学界的大会（会名已忘记）就提出过一个建议。后来又成立了一个研究文字改革的委员会，是由吴老（吴玉章）主持的，我也签了名。并且听说马老（马叙伦）、郭老（郭沫若）、沈雁冰部长，都曾同毛主席商量过这个问题。简化汉字方案出来时，我正在出版总署工作。听说1955年曾分发二十万份向全国各地征求意见。去年又交地方政协讨论过。其实，汉字简化问题在人民心目中早已存在。记得我在商务印书馆工作时，就有人提出过。
    至于拼音方案，吴老曾作过报告，仅仅是注音，为推广普通话并便利扫盲之用，并未提出代替汉字。注音的要求也由来已久，在民国初年就有人提出过。拼音字母将来是否将成为通用文字，这是将来的事情。不过早先鲁迅先生是曾主张用拼音文字的，因为可以促进文化的发展。当时没有人反对他，因为鲁迅自己读了许多古书，别人不能抓住这一点批评（别人提过曾遭反对）。今日在人民群众里面，赞成用拼音文字的当然有，我便是其中一个。不过，并不是要废除汉字。汉字要学还是可以学，古书还是可以读，汉字不会废除。我以为将来是有此可能的，因为拼音文字实在大有便利。最后我再说明一句，可是吴老的报告中却并不曾提出过这话。
    陈劭先希望共产党帮助民主党派改造思想
    他说：既然要长期共存、互相监督，就不能拿旧思想、落后思想去监督新的进步的思想，也不能拿资本主义去监督社会主义。
    中央统战部与各民主党派过去的关系到底怎样？对民主党派的帮助够不够？陈劭先在发言时，首先回答了这样两个问题。他说，统战部与各民主党派的关系，过去没有什么错误。民主党派的巩固和发展，民主党派成员的进步，都是同统战部的帮助分不开的。前几年，凡是有关民革的问题，统战部都邀请民革的负责人去研究、商量，对民革帮助很大。统战部的同志也常去民革和我们作个人接触，谈谈对工作、生活的意见。这些做法都很好。但是，近一年来，统战部为了怕干涉民主党派的内政，对我们的帮助也少了，关系也疏远了。我认为民主党派内部有了问题请统战部帮助、指示，并不等于干涉内政。因此，今天我要对统战部提出几点意见。首先希望统战部对民主党派的思想改造工作还是要指导、帮助。因为既然要“长期共存，互相监督”，就不能拿旧思想、落后思想去监督新的进步的思想，也不能拿资本主义去监督社会主义。只有思想改造好了，才能“长期共存，互相监督”。当然要做到这一点，在共产党方面也必须要克服三大主义。
    对于民主党派确实不能解决的问题，如房子问题，人事问题等，陈劭先也希望统战部能帮助解决。
    陈劭先对统战部的第三个希望是：希望统战部在可能范围内能在党政方面的重要政策、措施制定之前，事先征求民主党派的意见。他说，有些事情民主党派往往在登出报来后才晓得。事先不了解情况，如何进行监督？事先征求意见，民主党派才能起到监督作用。当然，属于机密方面的问题，又当别论。
    最后，陈劭先希望统战部能够同民主党派保持密切联系（包括私人接触在内），和大家多来往，多联系，不能因为怕干涉内政而不来往，越来越疏远。
    除了对统战部的四点希望以外，陈劭先还谈到三大主义的问题。他说，三大主义是互相关联的，但危害最大的是官僚主义。因为官僚主义牵涉的面最广，与全国人民有关。如果在工厂、农村官僚主义严重，就会引起工人农民的不满。在其他方面也是如此。我们要做好工作，防止人民内部矛盾扩大，就要扩大民主生活，克服官僚主义。克服官僚主义就能使我们的政权不断巩固。
    接着，他又谈到宗派主义。他说，宗派主义的危害也不小。虽然共产党一贯痛恨宗派主义，在延安就反过，今天还在反，但是干部中的宗派情绪仍然不少。有些人看不起民主人士，独断独行，就易犯官僚主义、主观主义的毛病。去年发生的许多问题，都是由官僚主义造成的，如果有关部门能够事先细心研究，和民主党派研究，就可避免许多损失。
    近来报纸上所揭露出来的事，不仅有些事情我们不了解，我想中共中央也不一定都知道。现在揭露出来，有助于矛盾的解决，我们人人都应该为正确处理人民内部矛盾而贡献自己的力量。
    王昆仑提出三点希望
    支持民主党派充分参加国家事务
    共产党要继续帮助民革团结进步
    在民革中的交叉党员要积极发挥作用
    王昆仑在发言中，提出了三点希望，他说：这是他个人的意见，但也反映了民革若干成员的意见。
    第一点希望是支持民主党派充分参加国家事务。过去民革和各民主党派一起，曾参加了国家事务，可是，还不够充分，希望今后凡是宪法范围以内的国家大计，不仅事前建议，事后批评，而且要做到参与他们自己职权内的决策、执行和检查。民革成员大多数是军政人员，现在大多数在国家机关做政治工作，在文艺方面也许放不出多少美丽的花朵，在学术方面也许不能一鸣惊人，可是应当在政治工作上多发挥力量，共同负责，当家作主，大家一起来建设社会主义的国家。
    在这个问题上，王昆仑声明说：尽管我们提出许多意见，指出许多缺点，其目的是在于要求扩大社会主义民主，民革有一位老同志说：“如果过分发展了分庭抗礼的思想，甚至动摇了以共产党为领导核心的认识，也决非国家之福”，这句话说明了我们尽管或多或少残存着资产阶级民主政治思想，可是坚决要走社会主义道路；尽管我们要唱对台戏，可是并不要资本主义国家的议会政治。我们是以共产党为领导的多党联合政府，民主党派不是在野的反对派，国家工作有缺点，我们也有一部分责任。只有是这样的立场观点，才能够充分参加国家事务，才能够向领导党进行监督和批评。
    谈到这里，王昆仑附带提出几个具体问题。第一个问题是在职的能做到有职、有权、有责，发挥作用。第二个问题是：无职的军政人员和一般社会人士能分别情况得到适当安排和就业与救济。第三个问题是：民革自己机关的干部首先应当自己多加关怀、培养，使他们发挥力量，安心工作。但是，物质条件不足，今后仍望政府予以可能的帮助。第四个问题是：对肃反，一方面坚持有反必肃的原则，一方面坚持有错必纠的原则。希望深入进行检查。凡是某些人在那里受到错误的处理的，在弄清楚以后，就在那里为他公开恢复名誉。但是在组织上、在思想上我们当然还要坚持划清敌我，如果的确是反革命分子，决不替他呼冤，决不替他要求平反。
    第二个希望是：共产党要继续帮助民革团结进步，帮助民革在所联系的群众中起带头作用。民革同志不少的人在解放前由于或先或后接受了共产党的领导和影响，才能从长期的分散和失败中把力量集中起来走向胜利。解放后，民革、民联、民促和第四方面四个方面合成一个今日的民革，几年来组织日趋巩固而且发展，去年一年，人数增加了一倍以上，联系社会人士，人数达到两万五千多，在内部差不多都忘记了过去四个方面的历史痕迹，团结一致，基本上几乎找不到宗派和对立。他说，几年来民革的发展、巩固，和统战部一贯的帮助分不开的，我们不能忘记过去几年中统战部怎样为民革创造发展条件，怎样从旁协助我们的团结、进步。希望今后统战部在不干涉民革内部事务的原则下，尽可能加强对民革的政治领导。
    但是，王昆仑说：当然，我们也不能忽视自己的努力。例如我们近年来在地方组织中也还有个别的不很团结的情况，就主要靠我们自己展开批评与自我批评，主要靠民革中央来帮助他们调整关系，一味责备当地的统战部是无用的。今后，民革作为民主党派的组织来看，仍然应当在自己所联系的群众中，先行一步，经常起带头作用，代表自己所联系群众的利益，帮助他们改造思想，这样才能创造长期共存的条件，这样自然能延年益寿，前途乐观，不会乍暖还寒，花开又落，而是风和日永，芳草连天。
    第三个希望是在民革组织中的交叉党员要积极发挥作用。他说：加入民革的共产党员和团员人数很少，但在中央不少地方都有，其中也有个别的人表现出某些不同的缺点，总的说来是兢兢业业，努力工作，在团结上起了积极作用。王昆仑认为：这些党、团员既加入民革的组织，在未退出民革以前，一方面固然要遵守党团的原则和纪律，不卷入人事纠纷，不要因为是党、团员就高人一等，但，另一方面也不应该过于战战兢兢，缩手缩脚，应当心胸坦荡，本着民革成员的身份，发挥积极作用。共产党员和团员要能善于和民革同志合作共事，民革成员更应当向党、团员学习，搞好合作共事关系。
    王绍鏊认为，墙是两方面砌的，也应两方面来拆，帮助共产党整风是为了巩固国家的领导核心
    王绍鏊发言说：我在上次发言中讲过，墙是两方面砌起来的，也应该由两方面动手拆。比如我自己就有这种毛病，我们从旧社会出身的知识分子，往往自鸣清高，强调“士为知己者死”，这就是墙的来源之一。我在财政部工作的时候，就不大愿意找薄一波部长，新旧年节，也不去拜年，结果在我们之间就有了隔阂，这种隔阂越来越深。我们应该主动地把这种清高思想去掉。“士为知己者死”这是封建社会的思想。
    他说，现在高级知识分子的待遇提高了，工资增多了，但这并不等于就使高级知识分子积极起来了。如果不信任他们，他们的积极性还是提高不起来的。据我了解，各厂矿旧的工程师十分之九都有此情况：你不信任我，我何必卖力气呢？
    他说，我们的墙是各式各样的，有主观主义的墙、有官僚主义的墙，尤其厉害的是宗派主义的墙，这些墙都各有各的拆法。宗派主义在各个地方也不是平衡的，有的地方重一些，有的地方就比较轻一些。
    据天津民主促进会的同志反映，我们那里的成员对“鸣”和“放”顾虑很大。我对天津民主促进会的同志讲，你们放心鸣放心放好了，只要站稳社会主义立场，从团结的愿望出发是可以大鸣大放的。我们这是为了帮助中国共产党整风，是为了巩固我们的领导核心，使得中国共产党不犯错误，或者少犯错误。我上次讲话说民主党派也要整风，影响很大，有人说，这是不要我们“鸣”和“放”了。这说明我高高在上，不了解群众的心理。
    有人说，苏联是一党专政，我说不是，苏联是无产阶级专政。中国是人民民主专政，而不是共产党一党专政。我要争鸣，我不能同意有些人提出的在学校中取消党委制的说法。但是党组织不应该代替行政。制度本身是不坏的，而是有人破坏了制度。
    建设社会主义一定要有共产党的领导，各个民主党派在政治上也要受共产党的领导，这是天经地义的。
    叶笃义希望不要称呼
    民主人士为“朋友们”
    叶笃义说，他要从一件小事情来谈“拆墙”的问题。他说，毛主席、周总理讲话的时候，常说“同志们，朋友们”，不论是在政协作报告还是对机关干部讲话都是这样。很明显，同志们，是指在座的共产党员；朋友们，是指在座的党外人士。他认为可以把“朋友们”三个字取消，因为政协成员都是统一战线以内的人，机关干部又都是周总理的部下，称朋友，不确切。他说，“同志”二字，有两种解释。一是一个党之内的；没有相同的组织关系的，不是同志。另一种解释，同志是志同道合的人。他说，“美国把我们称为共产党的同路人”，我认为很对，因为在统一战线里的人，都是拥护共产党、社会主义的。他说，一年前，民主同盟举行第二次代表大会时，李维汉部长谈到，对民建会员称同志，民建会员很高兴；称同志，这是因为企业公私合营了，有了基础了。经过一年，社会有了更大的变化，党中央负责同志讲话的时候，如果取消“朋友们”三个字，对党外人士会是很大的鼓舞。
    严景耀建议：合并四个党派
    成立“社会主义同盟”
    严景耀发言中，提了三点意见，第一，希望加强对党员的统一战线教育。他说：好些基层同志反映：把统战部的“统战”二字拆开看是“上统下战”。他说，下面有些教授因为有顾虑，还是不敢鸣、放。有人反映：大学大鸣，中学中鸣，小学小鸣。还有人说：“在学术上敢争鸣，但是在思想上不敢争鸣。”有些中学教师反映：“大的”“小的”都有人管了，就是我们“中的”还没有人管。在上海有人说了三句话：“贯彻多，研究少；命令多，商量少；要求多，帮助少。”谈到这里，严景耀举例说：有一个学校，共产党员的副校长因事出差，学校出了这样的布告：“副校长因公出差，校内一切事务均由校长代理。”根据以上情况，严景耀建议必须对下面加强统一战线的教育。另外，严景耀也谈到：下面有些单位的统战工作搞得很好，因为共产党的支部能够和民主党派支部遇事商量，发挥了民主党派的作用。
    严景耀说：我是民进的一分子，我很同意叶笃义的意见，把民盟、民进、九三学社、农工民主党合并起来。这四个党派都是做知识分子工作的，常常发生交叉，弄得群众很难应付，不知加入那个组织好。合起来，对团结、教育、改造知识分子大有好处，还可以让许多人解放出来做别的事。如果能够合并，可以叫“社会主义同盟”。
    第二个意见是：民主党派的专职干部，不属于政府机关和企业，也不属于党，对他们的待遇、提拔、培养，没有一定制度，许多人感到前途茫茫，不安心。值得注意。
    第三个意见，他谈的是关于扩大民主制度的措施。他说，人大代表、政协委员视察工作，对政府的工作起了监督和推动作用，但还不够。因为他们视察的范围、时间、地区都有限。他建议在中央和各级地方人代会设立各种常设委员会，比如经济、卫生等委员会，吸收民主党派、无党派人士、专家等参加，对各部的工作进行监督。
    罗隆基怀疑现有的党政机构能够防止和正确处理打击报复事件，他主张另外成立一个自成系统的委员会
    罗隆基发言说，最近有两位外国记者到他家去，请他谈谈对于“鸣”和“放”的印象，特别是对于马寅初、张奚若发言的意见。他说，他认为这次的争鸣是很健康的。大家虽然提了不少意见，但并没有人反对马克思主义和社会主义。这是一。第二、“鸣”和“放”是在党的领导下进行的，根据党中央的整风指示，集中批判三个主义。同时他还对外国记者说，他认为马寅初老先生顾虑太多。他不同意马寅初的意见，他说，在解放初期，许多老教授不能上课，经过学习提高，现在可以上课了。马寅初说，整风运动以后，许多青年助教因为教条主义太多，上不了课。其实这又有什么可怕呢！青年教师经过整风，抛掉教条主义，提高自己，将来就对国家有更大的贡献。这正是辩证的发展，这正是整风的作用。也不完全同意张奚若的意见。
    他说，前一天，陈叔通老先生对他说，现在的争鸣气候好像是“春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟”。他又续上两句“一片整风声，三害除多少。”他说，通过这次整风，“党加强了，民主党派也提高了”。
    第二，他说，有人提出要党提出保证，在他们对党进行批评以后，不致在将来受到打击报复。他认为要毛主席出来讲话保证，那是笑话。但他提出解决这个问题的一个具体方案，这就是要由人民代表大会，和政治协商委员会成立一个委员会，这个委员会不但要检查过去三反、五反、肃反运动中的偏差，它还将公开声明，鼓励大家有什么委屈都来申诉。这个委员会包括领导党，也包括民主党派和各方面的人士。他以为这样作有三个好处：一、可以鼓励大家提意见，各地知识分子就不会顾虑有话无处说，而是条条大路通北京了；二、过去的“五反”、“三反”、“肃反”虽然有很大的成绩，但是也发生了副作用，使人不敢讲话。有人担心在这次的“放”和“鸣”以后，还有“收”和“整”。在过去运动中受了委屈的，要给他们“平反”，就可以使他们减少同党和政府的隔膜。他还主张，“平反”的机构一定要同“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”的原领导机构分开。因为他认为这几个运动过去是共产党领导着搞的。“平反”时，除了领导党以外，还应该由各民主党派和无党派人士参加，说明运动有成绩，也为受了委屈的人解决问题。受委屈的人，不只各民主党派有，其实共产党内也有。三、现在谁都不能保证在下级机关里不发生打击报复事件，有这个机构，敢于打击报复的人，知所畏惧；受到打击报复的人就有路可走，他们可以提出控告。他以为，这样既检查了肃反中的遗留问题，又配合了整风。因此，他还主张地方人代会和政协也应该成立这样性质的委员会，使它成为一个系统。
    他认为共产党组织是否发展太快了
    第三，他认为共产党在发展组织方面，特别是在发展知识分子方面是否有些太快了，是值得领导党考虑的。在解放后这几年里，党员很快地发展到一千二百万。在他看来，在解放初期在知识分子中，有这样一些人，他们常是“打击别人，抬高自己”，而这样的人，他说却被党看成是积极分子，也就是进步分子，吸收进党。这些人多半没有经过多年的革命锻炼，也缺乏同自然作斗争的知识，他们“一朝权在手，便把令来行”，非党知识分子感到不服气，既影响了党的威信，又造成了党和非党的隔膜。
    他认为上司太多，森工部“没法子有权”
    第四、关于有职无权的问题。他认为，党员固然有责任，机构也有问题。他说，他在森林工业部里面是有职有权的，但是部以上有国务院的八个办公室，有国家计划委员会和国家经济委员会，另外还有党中央的各部，你这个部没有法子有权。很多事情都是从上往下贯彻，往下交任务。经委和计委向部里要的数字任务，也只能是主观主义的。计划整个地建筑在关起门来的主观主义的基础上。他认为经委和计委和国务院各办公室的领导人员多是党员，这也正说明党对旧知识分子很不信任。他以为“党员的政治虽强，技术知识和对经济计划工作的经验不一定都丰富”，应该放心地让旧知识分子参加管理工作。
    1956年是“全部的冒进”
    第五、关于当前工作中的主要偏向是“保守”还是“冒进”的问题。他认为从1956年以来主要是冒进，而不是保守。这不是那个人的问题，也不是那个部的问题，而是全部的冒进。张奚若先生说的“好大喜功”、“急功近利”，都是说的它的表现。这是把毛主席所说的“稳步前进”忘了的结果。
    蔡廷锴对简化字作书面发言
    蔡廷锴书面发言说，今天报载，昨天座谈会有几位同志关于文字改革问题谈了很多，但所公布的简化文字99％我赞同，还有些小意见。例如，“葉”、“箫”二字以字义分析来说，“葉”乃树木附属品，那“葉”改为“叶”；“箫”是乐器改为“肖”字。我接很多朋友来信均有意见，但文字改革委员会未将“叶”、“箫”二字解释清楚。我以为，群众有意见，希望文改会公开解释。
