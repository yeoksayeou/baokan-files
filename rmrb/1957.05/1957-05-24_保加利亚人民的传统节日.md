    Traditional Festivals of the Bulgarian People
    Today is the Day of People's Culture, Education, and Slavic Script in Bulgaria. Since 1857, for a century, this day has consistently been one of the most solemn national festivals for the Bulgarian people. Because the Bulgarian people commemorate the two Slavic brothers, Cyril and Methodius, who created the Slavic script on this day, it is also called Cyril and Methodius Day.
    Cyril and Methodius were two highly cultured missionaries of the 9th century AD and were the enlighteners of Slavic culture. They created the Slavic script and advocated the use of the Slavic language to spread religion, thereby countering the policy of annihilation and assimilation of the Slavs by the Byzantine and Germanic feudal empires, and laying the foundation for a cultural revolution in the lives of the Slavic people.
    During the dark ages of Turkish rule (1396-1878), the Bulgarian people, regardless of any coercion, always used this day to promote the cause of these two brothers; all schools held memorial services and summarized students' academic achievements; people's reading rooms (a special form of social education in Bulgaria similar to cultural centers) organized theatrical performances or other cultural activities. At that time, the commemorative activities of Slavic Script Day played a huge role in consolidating the national consciousness of the Bulgarian people.
    During the fascist rule, Slavic Script Day became a festival for the Slavic people to unite and fight against fascism and the Hitler gang. The Bulgarian people shattered the German fascists' conspiracy to alienate Bulgaria from other Slavic peoples, especially the friendship and cultural ties with the Russian people.
    After liberation, the Bulgarian people reviewed the achievements of the thriving people's education and new culture every year on this day. Students, staff of cultural institutions, and people in cultural and artistic circles all over the country organized parades on this day, holding giant statues of Cyril and Methodius, singing revolutionary songs, dancing folk dances, and spending their festival happily. On this day, they especially cherished the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the freedom and culture of the Bulgarian people and were inspired by their heroic deeds to more resolutely seize the positions of culture and science.
    This year, the Bulgarian people decided to expand the commemoration of this festival. A central action committee was established, and it was announced that the period from May 5 to May 24 would be the Month of People's Culture, Education, and Slavic Script, and academic institutions held report meetings. Various places also decided to hold commemorative meetings on May 23 and parades on May 24. In addition, preparations are being made to publish a special collection of materials on the education and culture of the Bulgarian people since 1857 within the year. Yan Jie

    保加利亚人民的传统节日
    今天是保加利亚的人民文化教育和斯拉夫文字节。从1857年起，一百年来，这一天始终是保加利亚人民最隆重的全民节日之一。因为保加利亚人民在这一天纪念创造斯拉夫文字的两位斯拉夫兄弟——基里尔和麦托迪，所以这一天也称基里尔和麦托迪节。
    基里尔和麦托迪是公元九世纪的两位有很高文化修养的传教士，是斯拉夫文化的启蒙者。他们创造了斯拉夫文字，主张用斯拉夫语言传播宗教，从而反击了拜占庭和日耳曼封建帝国对斯拉夫人的灭亡和同化政策，并且在斯拉夫民族的生活中奠定了文化革命的基础。
    在土耳其统治的黑暗年代（1396—1878年）的后期，保加利亚人民不顾任何逼迫，总要在这一天宣传这两位兄弟的事业；所有的学校都举行纪念会，并且总结学生的学习成绩；各人民读书室（保加利亚的类似文化馆的一种特殊的社会教育形式）都组织戏剧演出或其它文化活动。当时的斯拉夫文字节的纪念活动，对巩固保加利亚人民的民族意识起了巨大的作用。
    在法西斯统治时期，斯拉夫文字节成了斯拉夫人民为反对法西斯主义、反对希特勒匪帮而团结斗争的节日。保加利亚人民粉碎了德国法西斯分子离间保加利亚同其它斯拉夫人民，首先是同俄罗斯人民的友谊和文化联系的阴谋。
    解放以后，保加利亚人民每年都在这一天检阅正在蓬勃发展中的人民教育事业和新文化的成就。全国各地的学生、文化机关的工作人员和文化艺术界人士，在这一天组织游行，举着基里尔和麦托迪的巨像，唱着革命歌曲，跳着民间舞蹈，欢天喜地地度过自己的节日。他们在这一天特别怀念为保加利亚人民的自由和文化而牺牲的革命先烈，并且从他们的英勇事迹中得到鼓舞，更顽强地攻占文化和科学的阵地。
    今年，保加利亚人民决定扩大纪念这个节日。成立了中央行动委员会，宣布自5月5日到5月24日为人民文化教育和斯拉夫文字月，各学术机关举办了报告会。各地还决定在5月23日举行纪念大会，在5月24日举行游行。此外，还准备在年内出版自1857年以来有关保加利亚人民教育和文化的资料的专集。　燕杰
