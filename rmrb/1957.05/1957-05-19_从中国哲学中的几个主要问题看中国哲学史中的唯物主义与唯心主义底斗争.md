    From the Struggle Between Materialism and Idealism in the History of Chinese Philosophy from Several Major Issues in Chinese Philosophy
                                Feng Youlan
    The history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism. Materialism and idealism are two opposing aspects of the unity of philosophy. There is struggle and unity in their relationship, and they can also transform into each other. Of course, just like the opposing aspects of other unities, the struggle between them is absolute, and the unity is relative.
    The purpose of this article is to illustrate that these situations do exist by examining the development and changes of several major issues in Chinese philosophy. As for the epistemological and class roots of these situations, as well as the specific historical conditions of the development and changes of these issues, they will be discussed separately.
    The major issues in Chinese philosophy discussed in this article are:
    (1) The question of "Heaven"
    (2) The question of "Qi"
    (3) The question of "Mind"
    (4) The question of "Li"
    1. The Question of "Heaven"
    Traditional religious thought since the Yin Dynasty held that there was a supreme god who ruled the world. This supreme ruler was called Di, or Shangdi, and also called Heaven. This meaning of Heaven is what we call the Heaven of Sovereignty.
    With the development of science and materialist thought, the influence of religion gradually diminished to a certain extent. In the Yin Dynasty, the authority of "Heaven" was unlimited. The people of the Western Zhou Dynasty said: "August Heaven has no favorites, it only assists virtue." The meaning of this sentence, on the one hand, is to think that "August Heaven" is upright, giving it a moral character and elevating it; on the other hand, it also gives the authority of "August Heaven" a restriction, thinking that it cannot act arbitrarily, but can only bless the virtuous. The people of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty questioned whether Heaven was upright. The Book of Songs preserves the questions raised by these doubters. By the time of Confucius, the authority of Heaven had a tendency to gradually decline.
    Confucius's thought was influenced by this trend. It is very obvious that he was skeptical about the existence of ghosts and gods. The "Heaven" he spoke of also had the meaning of sovereignty, but it was different from traditional religion. This can be seen by comparing it with Mozi. Mozi said: "Heaven's love for the people is great," "It made the sun, moon, and stars to illuminate the way. It established the four seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer to govern them, and thunder, rain, snow, frost, and dew to nourish the five grains and hemp so that the people can obtain wealth and benefit. It established mountains, rivers, streams, and valleys, and distributed all things to supervise the good and bad of the people" ("Mozi" "The Will of Heaven, Part 2"). This is the "Heaven" of traditional religion. The "Heaven" that Confucius spoke of was not so vivid. He said: "Does Heaven speak? The four seasons proceed and all things grow. Does Heaven speak?" Some historians of philosophy believe that the "Heaven" Confucius spoke of is the four seasons and all things, which is nature. This is not entirely appropriate. However, this passage can prove that the religious meaning of the "Heaven" Confucius spoke of is relatively weak; therefore, the Mohists said that the Confucians "consider Heaven to be unclear; and ghosts to be not spiritual" ("Gongmeng").
    The Mohists raised the question of "effort" and "fate". They believed that the success of human behavior is not due to a predetermined destiny (fate), but mainly due to individual effort (effort). The Mohists valued human subjective initiative, believing that the Confucians emphasized the authority of fate, valuing fate and not effort, using this as a reason to "oppose Confucianism". This criticism of Confucianism by the Mohists is not very appropriate, because the Confucians also valued human subjective initiative.
    In Confucian thought, "fate" is a concept related to "Heaven". "Fate" is also called "Heaven's Mandate", its meaning being either God's command or a natural or social force that is beyond human control. Confucius acknowledged the existence of "Heaven" and "Fate". "Heaven" and "Fate" determine the success or failure of human behavior. But at the same time, he also believed that no matter how "Heaven" and "Fate" determine, people themselves can, and should, still do what they think they should do with their own strength, without having to worry about whether the result is success or failure. He himself was one who "knows it is impossible, yet does it" ("Analects" "Xianwen"). He also believed that a person's moral character can be completely accomplished by relying on one's own efforts, without being limited by Heaven's Mandate. He said, "Is benevolence far away? If I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives" ("Analects" "Shuer"). This is a recognition of human subjective initiative, and also a restriction on the authority of "Heaven" and "Fate". Confucius believed that, at least in the realm of morality, human subjective initiative can be fully and freely expressed.
    In the Confucian system, "Heaven" occupies the highest position. In the Daoist system, the position of Heaven is lowered, and there is Dao above Heaven. The Laozi book says, "I do not know whose child it is, it seems to have been before God" (Chapter 4). This God is Shangdi. He said that Dao "does not know whose child it is," that is to say, it is the earliest thing, "before God," that is, before Shangdi. Of course, Laozi did not admit the existence of God. He clearly denied the existence of a Heaven of Sovereignty. This sentence only means that, if there is God, Dao is also before him. Of course, if there is something before him, he cannot be God. The Laozi book also says, "Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows Dao, Dao follows nature" (Chapter 25). This also means that Dao is higher in position than Heaven. Regarding the meaning of Dao as Laozi said, everyone has different interpretations recently. According to the view that Dao is a material thing, Laozi said: "There is a thing mixed and formed, born before Heaven and Earth." This "mixed and formed" "thing" is probably the "Qi" or "essence" that we will talk about below. The "Heaven" mentioned in the Zhuangzi book sometimes means nature. "Zhuangzi" "Autumn Waters" says: "The four feet of cattle and horses are called Heaven," "Tying a horse's head and piercing a cow's nose is called man." This so-called Heaven means nature. This is very clear. However, this so-called Heaven is not a thing, but only a quality.
    Under this materialist attack, in the Mencius thought system, "Heaven" was transformed from a religious meaning to an idealist meaning, obtaining a more detailed form. In Mencius's thought, "Heaven" became the moral principle of the world, and sometimes also had the meaning of sovereignty. Mencius's idealism added the moral principles of society to the natural world, believing that the world is a moral world, its highest principle is "Heaven", and its expression in man is "nature". Therefore, "nature is inherently good", so "knowing nature" can also "know Heaven" ("Mencius" "Jinxin, Part 1").
    Mencius elaborated on the human subjective initiative advocated by Confucius. He said, "What arrives without being brought is fate" (Mencius "Wanzhang, Part 1"), and also said, "There is nothing that is not fate; accept it correctly. Therefore, those who know fate do not stand under dangerous walls. Those who die after exhausting their way are dying justly. Those who die in shackles are not dying justly" (Mencius "Jinxin, Part 1"). The meaning is that a person must have exhausted all that he can do, and only then can the encounter that follows be "what arrives without being brought." If there is something that has not been done to the best of one's ability, then any encounter cannot be attributed to fate. Suppose there is a dangerous wall about to collapse, and a person who believes that "life and death are determined by fate" deliberately stands under it, resulting in being crushed to death. In Mencius's view, this does not count as knowing fate. In addition, Mencius also emphasized that a person's moral character is "obtained by seeking it, lost by abandoning it" (ibid.), which has nothing to do with fate.
    In the late Warring States period, the development of materialism reached a climax. Some of the Confucians had to turn to materialism. In Xunzi's system, Heaven still occupies the highest position, but the Heaven he speaks of is actually nature, the natural world independent of human will. He called the operation of the natural world "the course of Heaven". He believed that the operation of the natural world has its objective laws, which do not depend on human will. He said: "The course of Heaven is constant, it does not exist for Yao, nor does it perish for Jie" ("Xunzi" "On Heaven"). This is the influence that Xunzi accepted from the above-mentioned Daoist thought.
    The Daoist view of nature is materialistic, but in their system, human subjective initiative has no place. According to them, the laws of the natural world are objective and inevitable. In the face of these laws, people can only obey and surrender, passively accept and wait for the arrangement of fate. Zhuangzi said: "To know what cannot be helped and to be at peace with it as if it were fate is the height of virtue" ("Zhuangzi" "Ren Jian Shi"). This should be considered a great shortcoming of Daoist thought.
    Xunzi elaborated on the human subjective initiative emphasized in Confucian thought. He pointed out that the task of man is not to praise nature, but to control nature and make it serve mankind. He said, "To magnify Heaven and think of it, is it better than to domesticate and control it; to follow Heaven and praise it, is it better than to control Heaven's Mandate and use it" ("Xunzi" "On Heaven"). This spirit of fighting against nature is not found in Daoist thought.
    2. The Question of "Qi"
    The question of Heaven will be discussed further below, but let's first talk about the question of Qi.
    In the Daoist and Yin-Yang schools, Qi is a material entity. How do we know that it is a material entity? Because generally speaking, philosophers who talk about Qi believe that Qi has two kinds: light and clear, and heavy and turbid. The light and clear is called Yang, and the heavy and turbid is called Yin. Since Qi has the attributes of lightness, heaviness, clearness, and turbidity, it is of course a material thing. Qi has these two kinds: the light and clear rises up to become Heaven, and the heavy and turbid congeals to become Earth. By extension, everything is formed by the combination of Yin and Yang Qi. The Five Elements originally referred to the five things that are closely related to human life. Later, they referred to the five properties of matter or the five forces of the natural world, called "Five Virtues", and also referred to Qi with five properties, called "Five Qi". The Yin-Yang and Five Elements schools of the pre-Qin period established a materialist view of nature centered on the concepts of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, using the operation of Yin-Yang and "Five Virtues" or "Five Qi" to explain the changes of the four seasons in the natural world and the succession of dynasties in history.
    The Daoists also believed that there is a subtle kind of Qi, called "essence". The so-called essence may be the light and clear Yang Qi. "Guanzi" "Neiye" says: "When a person is born, Heaven produces his essence, and Earth produces his form. Combine these to make a person. Harmony produces life, disharmony does not produce life." Essence is produced by Heaven, and form is produced by Earth. "Lüshi Chunqiu" says that all things have essence and Qi, and have form and Qi ("Jinshu"). Laozi said: "All things carry Yin and embrace Yang, blending Qi to achieve harmony" (Chapter 42). From these words, they all seem to believe that a person's body is composed of heavy and turbid Qi, and the spirit is composed of light and clear Qi.
    The Daoists believed that this essence and Qi circulate in the world, and noble things are composed of essence and Qi. "Neiye" says: "The essence of all things, this is life. Below, it produces the five grains, and above, it becomes the stars. Flowing between Heaven and Earth, it is called ghosts and gods. Stored in the chest, it is called a sage." This essence and Qi exists in the human body and can freely enter and exit. It is the source of human life and wisdom. The more "essence" stored in a person's body, the more active his vitality and the greater his wisdom. If the "essence" completely leaves, the person dies. (For a detailed discussion on this aspect, see my article "The Materiality of Dao as Defined by Pre-Qin Daoists." "Guangming Daily" "Philosophical Research" special issue No. 13. September 9, 1954).
    Mencius talked about "Qi" in many places. He talked about "vast Qi," "morning Qi," and "night Qi." The "Neiye" quoted above says that essence and Qi are "stored in the chest, called a sage." It also says: "Internally stored as a source, vast and peaceful, as a Qi abyss." It seems that the "essence and Qi" that the Daoists call can also be called "vast Qi." The Chu Ci "Yuanyou" chapter says, "The One Qi is extremely spiritual, existing in the middle of the night." Mencius also said: "Night Qi is not enough to store" ("Gaozi"). Presumably, the so-called "essence and Qi" likes tranquility. People have fewer thoughts at night, so more essence and Qi comes. It seems that the essence and Qi mentioned by the Daoists can also be called "night Qi." Therefore, it can also be called "morning Qi." Mencius's so-called "vast Qi" was later called "righteous Qi." The "Yuanyou" chapter says, "Introspect with upright conduct, seek the source of righteous Qi." The Daoists also call essence and Qi righteous Qi. Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteous Qi" says: "Heaven and Earth have righteous Qi, mixed and endowed to flow in form, above it becomes rivers and mountains, below it becomes sun and stars. In man it is called vast, filling the vast sky." The meaning of these words corresponds exactly to the passage from Neiye quoted above ("Yuanyou" chapter, whether it was written by Qu Yuan or not, its thought is Daoist thought).
    From these titles, the "Qi" that Mencius speaks of is related to the "Qi" or "essence and Qi" that the Daoists speak of. Mr. Guo Moruo determined that the four chapters of "Guanzi" are the Daoist doctrines of Jixia in the State of Qi. Mencius also lectured in the State of Qi, and his philosophical thought was influenced by Daoism. In his system, he used some Daoist ideas and terms, which is also very natural, but these ideas and terms were originally all materialistic. Mencius took them over, distorted them, and made them serve his own views, making them part of his system.
    Therefore, although the "Qi" mentioned by Mencius is related to the "Qi" mentioned by the Daoists, there is a significant difference between the "Qi" mentioned by the two schools. This can be seen from two points.
    (1) The "Qi" or "essence and Qi" mentioned by the Daoists is a material thing and has no moral significance. The "Qi" mentioned by Mencius has moral significance, such as "night Qi" and "morning Qi," which all have moral significance. His so-called "vast Qi" is "cultivated" by the method of "matching righteousness with the Dao"; it is "accumulating righteousness," that is, gathering many moral behaviors, and over time, "producing" it. Although this is called "Qi," it is actually a mystical spiritual state. Mencius called this "Qi," "filling between Heaven and Earth," exaggerating a subjective spiritual state as if it objectively exists. It should be pointed out that this is a consistent practice of idealists.
    (2) In the Daoist system, the position of Qi is higher than the position of the mind. Laozi said: "Using the mind to control Qi is called strong... This is called not following the Dao, and not following the Dao will end early" (Chapter 55). The Daoists believe that the function of the mind is thinking, and "essence and Qi" is precisely afraid of the disturbance of thinking. Laozi advocated "less thinking and fewer desires," "concentrating Qi to achieve gentleness." Therefore, using the "mind" to control "Qi" is not in accordance with the "Dao." Things that are not in accordance with the Dao cannot exist for long.
    Zhuangzi said, "Do not listen with the ear, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with the Qi" ("Ren Jian Shi"). He believed that the mind cannot obtain the "Dao," only Qi can obtain the "Dao."
    In Mencius's thought system, the position of Qi is lower than the position of the mind (except for vast Qi). Mencius talked about several methods of keeping the mind unmoved. One method is a low-level method, which is the method used by Beigong You and Meng Shishe. The key point is to "guard the Qi." The "Qi" that Mencius speaks of in this place may be material and refers to the physiological aspects of the human body. These two warriors, Beigong You and Meng Shishe, relied on the so-called "blood Qi courage" to achieve unmovedness of the mind. In Mencius's view, this is a low-level method of achieving unmovedness of the mind. As Mencius said, Gaozi used a more advanced method. His method was to "hold his will, do not abuse his Qi" (previous annotations said that this was Mencius's method, which may not be correct. Mencius's method was to cultivate "vast Qi"). Gaozi's method was based on "Will is the commander of Qi; Qi is the filling of the body," "When the will arrives, the Qi is second" (previous annotations also believed that this was Mencius's opinion), which means that the position of "will" is higher than the position of "Qi." Mencius's own method was to cultivate "vast Qi." In his view, this was the highest method (for Mencius's discussion on the method of "unmovedness of the mind," see "Mencius" "Gongsun Chou").
    The Daoists demanded to keep all the "essence and Qi" that people have and not let it be lost. They can be said to be "seeking to release Qi." Mencius advocated "seeking to release the mind." The so-called "night Qi" and "morning Qi" are only conditions for "preserving the mind."
    From this, in Mencius's thought system, the position of the mind is higher than the position of Qi. Although "vast Qi" is called "Qi," it is actually not a material thing, so it is not the Qi that the Daoists speak of.
    In this way, in Mencius's thought, "Qi" was transformed from a materialistic concept into an idealistic concept.
    Yin and Yang are also two main concepts in the "Book of Changes" system. However, in this system, Yin and Yang are not two kinds of Qi, but two categories. These two categories represent the two properties of strength and gentleness. It believes that things with strength, such as Heaven, ruler, father, husband, etc., are all considered Yang; gentle things, such as Earth, subject, son, wife, etc., are all considered Yin. "One Yin and one Yang is called Dao." According to its saying, Heaven and Earth are the Yin and Yang of the natural world; ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife are the Yin and Yang in society. It abstracts Yin and Yang. The two concepts of Yin and Yang are transformed from concrete material Qi into two abstract concepts.
    However, we cannot say from this that the Book of Changes system is idealistic thought. Because it did not objectify these two concepts, the properties of Yin and Yang can only be expressed in concrete things. According to its system, in the natural world, Heaven and Earth express these two properties, and in society, ruler and subject, etc., express these two properties. The Heaven and Earth it speaks of are the material Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the view of nature in the Book of Changes is still materialistic.
    The Book of Changes believes that its sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred and eighty-four lines all represent a kind of "Dao," that is to say, they all represent a law followed by the changes of things. The laws of things in nature and society have all been completely included by it, with no omissions. Therefore, a Book of Changes can "encompass the transformations of Heaven and Earth without going beyond, and perfectly form all things without leaving anything out" (Appended Remarks, Part 1). Although it says that it can know these laws because it "looks up to observe the celestial phenomena and looks down to examine the geographical patterns" (ibid.), in fact, this system of laws is a fictional system, and it is even more of a illusory thought to believe that this system can include all laws. These are the idealistic elements of the Book of Changes.
    In the late Warring States period, the development of materialism reached a climax. Idealists in the Han Dynasty had to use the achievements already obtained by materialism in the Warring States period, adding to and distorting them to match their own idealistic system. Dong Zhongshu did this work.
    He absorbed the doctrines of the Yin-Yang and Five Elements schools, and also absorbed the Daoist doctrines about Qi and essence in the "Neiye" and "Baixin" chapters of Guanzi ("Chunqiu Fanlu" "Tong Guoshen"). He synthesized these doctrines to establish a view of nature centered on Qi. He said: "The change of one in the Spring and Autumn Annals is called Yuan, and Yuan is like origin," "Yuan is the root of all things," "Wang Ying." He did not explain whether "Yuan" is material or spiritual. However, later the Gongyang school believed that Yuan is "Qi." He Xiu's "Commentary on the Gongyang Zhuan" said, "The change of one is Yuan, and Yuan is Qi. It arises without form and divides with form, creating Heaven and Earth, and is the beginning of Heaven and Earth." Dong Zhongshu also has the term "Yuan Qi," "The Qi of Heaven and Earth combines into one, divides into Yin and Yang, separates into four seasons, and arranges into five elements" ("Five Elements Generate Each Other"). He used the operation of Yin-Yang and Five Elements to explain the changes of the four seasons. He believed that people live in Qi. He said: "Between Heaven and Earth, there is Yin and Yang Qi, which constantly permeates people, just as water constantly permeates fish. The difference from water is whether it can be seen or not" ("Like Heaven's Action"). He advocated "Heaven-Human Interaction." For the explanation of "Heaven-Human Interaction," he sometimes adopted a mechanistic view. "Heaven-Human Interaction," "Beautiful things summon beautiful kinds, and bad things summon bad kinds," "Things summon each other according to their kind." This is like "the five tones compare and sound themselves, not because there is a god, but because of their number" ("Same Kind Move Each Other").
    Dong Zhongshu synthesized the materialistic doctrines about "Qi" in the pre-Qin period to establish his own view of nature, but at the same time, he also distorted these doctrines. He believed that "Heaven... is compatible with man, and combines with him by kind, and Heaven and man are one" ("Yin-Yang Meaning"). Man has will and purpose, and Heaven also has will and purpose. Man has joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, and Heaven also has joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. Qi also has joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, "The four Qi are the same for Heaven and man" ("Wang Dao Tong San"), which becomes mysticism.
    The "Heaven" that Dong Zhongshu speaks of is the mystification of nature. He distorted the Heaven of nature, making it also have the meaning of the Heaven of Sovereignty, becoming a kind of animism.
    His "Heaven-Human Interaction" theory is also the result of over-exaggerating the human subjective initiative emphasized by the Confucians, believing that man can move Heaven. What Xunzi said about human subjective initiative towards nature is correct and is a manifestation of scientific spirit; what Dong Zhongshu said is absurd and is a manifestation of religious thought.
    The Prince of Huainan, who presided over the writing of the "Book of Huainan," was a representative figure of the anti-centralization faction at that time. He opposed Dong Zhongshu's policy of advocating centralization and unified thought. In these aspects, he was the opposite of Dong Zhongshu. The "Book of Huainan" also takes "Qi" as the center to establish a theory of world generation, but he also advocated "Heaven-Human Interaction." It says, "The emotions of the ruler communicate with Heaven above, so executing the violent will cause many gales, distorting laws and decrees will cause many insect pests, killing the innocent will cause the country to turn red, and orders that are not collected will cause much excessive rain" ("Astronomy Training"). Not only can the behavior of the ruler move Heaven, but according to it, the behavior of ordinary individuals can also have similar results. It cited the legends of Shi Kuang making music and the Qi woman complaining of injustice, and concluded that even if they were "blind musicians and common women," as long as they "concentrated their minds, delegated their affairs, and accumulated their spirits," they could also "communicate with the nine heavens and stimulate the most refined essence" (Lan Ming Training).
    Dong Zhongshu accepted some ideas of pre-Qin materialism, but distorted them into mysticism. For the materialistic tradition of the pre-Qin period, this is a negation.
    During this period, materialistic thought launched a fierce struggle against Dong Zhongshu and the mystical thought of the "Apocryphal Texts" that followed, and the most systematic work was Wang Chong's "Lunheng."
    There have been many treatises on Wang Chong's materialistic thought recently, so there is no need to talk much about it now. It only needs to be pointed out that Wang Chong's main achievement lies in refuting Dong Zhongshu and the later "Apocryphal Texts"' distortion of Qi and their mystical doctrine of "Heaven-Human Interaction." As for Dong Zhongshu's doctrine about Qi, he basically accepted it. He said: "When the original Qi has not yet divided, the chaos is one. The Confucian books also say, the vast and murky Qi has not yet divided." "The words of the Confucian books probably have something to see" ("Lunheng" "Talking about Heaven"), "The birth of all things is endowed with the original Qi" ("Words of Poison"), "Before a person is born, he is in the original Qi, and after death he returns to the original Qi" ("On Death"), "Heaven and Earth combine Qi, and all things are born naturally, just as husband and wife combine Qi, and children are born naturally" ("Nature"). Wang Chong also used the operation of Yin and Yang to explain the changes of the four seasons. "The Way of Heaven is inaction, so spring does not work to give birth, and summer does not work to grow, autumn does not work to complete, and winter does not work to store. The Yang Qi comes out naturally, and things grow naturally. The Yin Qi rises naturally, and things complete and store naturally" ("Nature").
    Wang Chong also highly admired Dong Zhongshu. He said: "Dong Zhongshu's way of saying the art is wonderful" ("Case Books"), "Dong Zhongshu's words on morality and politics are commendable" (ibid.).
    For the materialistic thought of the pre-Qin period, Dong Zhongshu's thought is a negation. Wang Chong negated Dong Zhongshu, which is the negation of the negation. But he also accepted some of Dong Zhongshu. He refuted Dong Zhongshu's distortion of "Qi" and accepted the rational parts of it. After this clarification, there were very few distortions among those who spoke of Qi later.
    Wang Chong also refuted the "Heaven-Human Interaction" theory, believing that people cannot move Heaven, and Heaven has no purpose or will. He said: "Is Heaven Qi? If it is Qi, it is like clouds and smoke. If it is a body, it is the same as Earth" ("Talking about Heaven"). "Why do we say that Heaven is natural and inaction? It is Qi, which is tranquil and without desires, and without action and without affairs" ("Nature"). From this, Wang Chong re-established the meaning of the Heaven of nature in philosophy. After Wang Chong, there were still many discussions about the question of "Heaven," but this question no longer occupied a major position in later philosophical thought. That is to say, regarding this question, after the negation of the negation, a basic solution has been obtained.
    3. The Question of "Mind"
    In the history of philosophy, the most important difficulty concerning the question of the "mind" is to correctly recognize the qualitative difference between "mind" and "matter." Engels said in "Anti-Dühring": "Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy was primitive and spontaneous materialism. As spontaneous materialism, it could not explain the relationship between thinking and matter" (Chinese edition, People's Publishing House, p. 142). The materialistic thought of China before the Qin and Han dynasties also encountered difficulties on this issue. The religions since the Yin and Zhou dynasties all said that a person has a ghost that continues to exist after death, which is of course a superstition. This superstition arose from the question of the relationship between thinking and matter. The materialists of the pre-Qin period denied the existence of ghosts and broke this superstition, but they did not completely and correctly solve the problem of the relationship between thinking and matter. Most of the Daoists believed that "essence" is the source of intelligence and wisdom, and we have already discussed this idea above. On the one hand, this idea has a materialistic meaning, but its mistake is to regard thinking as a material thing and to confuse the spirit with matter.
    This question of the relationship between spirit and body has been an important issue in philosophy in the following centuries, called the problem of "form" and "spirit." Huan Tan and Wang Chong both discussed this issue. Huan Tan said: "The spirit dwells in the form, just as fire burns a candle" ("New Treatise on Form and Spirit," "Hongmingji" vol. 5). Wang Chong said, "The spirit of man is hidden within the body, just as millet is in a bag" ("Lunheng" "On Death"). Wang Chong believed that the spirit cannot leave the body, which was a step forward compared to the previous Daoist statement; but he still believed that the spirit is essence and Qi, which is material.
    After Buddhism arrived in China, the problem of form and spirit became one of the most intense issues of struggle between thinkers who supported Buddhism and those who opposed Buddhism. Zong Bing's "Mingfo Lun" (also known as "On the Non-Extinction of the Spirit") summarized the main ideas of Buddhism as: "The spirit does not perish, people can become Buddhas, the mind creates all things, all dharmas are empty, predestined relationships are long-lasting, and retribution comes after billions of kalpas" ("Hongmingji" vol. 2). The spirit mentioned here is the mind. All things, including the material world, are created by the mind. The spirit of a person does not perish after death, so he can receive retribution in the next life. The law of cause and effect and the cycle of retribution in Buddhism are all built on the assertion that "the spirit does not perish." The "spirit" or "mind" they speak of is non-material. From this point alone, they had a relatively clear understanding of the relationship between thinking and matter on the one hand, but on the other hand, they made even greater mistakes. They exaggerated the mind and made it absolute, and in turn, they said that material things are also spiritual things, thus becoming idealism.
    Huan Tan originally advocated the theory of the extinction of the spirit, but his metaphor became the basis for the theory of the non-extinction of the spirit in the eyes of Buddhism. Sengyou said, "Lord Junshan had not heard the teachings of Shakya, but the analogy of firewood and fire was secretly agreed upon by later speakers" ("Hongmingji" vol. 5). Huiyuan's "A Monk Does Not Reverence the King" discussed "the form ends but the spirit does not perish" saying: "The transmission of fire to firewood is like the transmission of spirit to form. The transmission of fire to different firewood is like the transmission of spirit to different forms," "Those who are confused see the form decay in one lifetime, and then think that the spirit and emotions are both lost, just as they see the fire exhausted in one piece of wood and think that the end is completely exhausted" ("Hongmingji" vol. 5).
    Fan Zhen's "Theory of the Extinction of the Spirit" believed that the spirit is the function generated by the body, "Form is the substance of the spirit, and the spirit is the function of the form." "The spirit is to the substance as sharpness is to the blade, and the form is to the function as the blade is to the sharpness," and specifically pointed out, "Considerations of right and wrong are the responsibility of the mind" ("Hongmingji" vol. 5). On the one hand, this view believes that the spirit is the function of the body, and on the other hand, it recognizes that the spirit is not just a kind of matter. Thus, the relationship between thinking and matter was correctly understood. This understanding absorbed part of the Buddhist understanding of the mind, and on this basis, it negated the Buddhist theory of form and spirit.
    The Buddhist idea that thinking and spirit are the foundation of the world, "the mind creates all things," is a negation of the doctrines on the spirit from the pre-Qin Daoists to Wang Chong. Fan Zhen's thought is the negation of the negation of Buddhism.
    Fan Zhen's correct view ended the debate on the issue of "form and spirit," and there was little discussion on this issue later. However, the question of the mind continued to be a major issue in Chinese philosophy. The exaggeration and distortion of the mind by idealism has deep epistemological roots and class roots. When encountering a materialistic blow on one issue, it manifests itself on another issue.
    4. The Question of "Li"
    After the end of the Tang Dynasty, the dominant philosophical thought was Daoxue. The main question in Daoxue was which is the first nature, "Li," "Qi," or "Mind."
    "Li" is also an important concept in Chinese philosophy, but its meaning has gradually become richer. Mencius said: "The pleasure of Li and righteousness to my heart is like the pleasure of fodder to my mouth" ("Gaozi, Part 1"). The "Li" Mencius speaks of is mainly moral principles. "Han Feizi" "Explanation of Laozi" says: "Li is the pattern of forming things, and all things have different Li." The "Li" that Han Fei speaks of mainly refers to the nature and laws of things in the natural world. Later, the Huayan sect of Buddhism spoke of four realms of Dharma: first, the realm of Li Dharma; second, the realm of event Dharma; third, the realm of unobstructed Li and event Dharma; and fourth, the realm of unobstructed event and event Dharma. The Li they spoke of is the essence of the so-called mind, and the event is the phenomenon expressed by the mind. The Li spoken of by the Daoxue of the Song and Ming dynasties included the various meanings mentioned above. However, the Cheng-Zhu school of thought emphasized the moral principles and the meaning of natural laws, while the Lu-Wang school of thought emphasized the meaning of the essence of the mind.
    The ideas about "Qi" and "essence and Qi" spoken of by the Daoists were preserved in Taoism. The main idea of Taoism is still that there is essence and Qi in the human body, and if one can preserve the essence and Qi, one can live forever. Therefore, Taoism also requires people to become monks and cultivate themselves in order to achieve the goal of immortality. The Daoxue of the Song and Ming dynasties opposed Buddhism and Taoism, which they called the "Two Schools." However, many of their ideas were absorbed from the "Two Schools." It can be said that they were able to learn from the enemy and also draw a clear line of demarcation between themselves and the enemy. Their main position was to affirm real life and affirm human life. On this point, they engaged in an irreconcilable struggle with

    从中国哲学中的几个主要问题看中国哲学史中的唯物主义与唯心主义底斗争
                                冯友兰
    哲学史是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争底历史。唯物主义与唯心主义是哲学这个统一物底两个对立面。他们之间的关系有斗争，也有统一，也可以互相转化。当然也正如其它统一物底对立面一样，它们之间的斗争是绝对的，统一是相对的。
    本文底目的，在于从中国哲学中的几个主要问题底发展变化，说明这些情况是确实存在的。至于这些情况底认识论的和阶级的根源，以及这些问题底发展变化底具体历史条件，当另行讨论。
    本文主要讨论的几个中国哲学中的主要问题是：
    （一）关于“天”的问题
    （二）关于“气”的问题
    （三）关于“心”的问题
    （四）关于“理”的问题
    一、关于“天”的问题
    从殷朝以来的传统宗教思想，认为有一个至上神主宰世界，这个最高的主宰称为帝，或上帝，也称为天。这样意义的天，我们称为主宰之天。
    随着科学和唯物主义思想底发展，宗教底影响在一定程度上逐渐缩小。在殷朝时代，“天”底权威是不受任何限制的。西周人说：“皇天无亲，唯德是辅”。这句话底意义，在一方面说，是认为“皇天”是正直的，给予他一种道德底性质，把它抬高了；在又一方面说，也是给“皇天”底权威一种限制，认为它不能随便行事，而只能保佑有德的人。东周人对于天是否正直发生了疑问。诗经中保存了这些怀疑者所提出的疑问。到了孔子底时代，天底权威更有逐渐降低的趋势。
    孔子底思想是受这种趋势底影响的。他对于鬼神底存在，持怀疑态度，这是很明显的。他所说的“天”也是有主宰底意义，但与传统的宗教已有不同。这一点，跟墨子比较，就可以看出来。墨子说：“天之爱民之厚”，“以磨（?）为日月星辰以昭道之。制为四时春秋冬夏以纪纲之，雷（霣）降雪霜雨露以长遂五谷麻丝，使民得而财利之。列为山川溪谷，播赋百事，以临司民之善否”（“墨子”“天志中”）。这是传统宗教中的“天”。孔子所说的“天”没有这样活灵活现。他说：“天何言哉，四时行焉，百物生焉，天何言哉”。有哲学史家根据这段话，认为孔子所说的“天”就是四时万物，就是自然，这是不十分恰当的。但是这段话可以证明孔子所说的“天”底宗教的意味比较淡薄；所以墨家说儒家“以天为不明；以鬼为不神”（“公孟”）。
    墨家提出“力”与“命”底问题，它认为人底行为底成功，并不是由于预先决定的命运（命），而主要地是由于个人底努力（力）。墨家重视人底主观能动性，认为儒家强调命运底权威，重命而不重力，以此作为“非儒”底一个理由。墨家对儒家的批判底这一点，并不很恰当，因为儒家也是很重视人底主观能动性的。
    在儒家思想中“命”是一个与“天”有关的概念。“命”也称“天命”，其意义或者就是上帝底命令，或者是人力所无可奈何的一种自然界中的或社会中的势力。孔子承认有“天”有“命”。 “天”“命”决定人底行为底成功或失败。但同时他又认为无论“天”和“命”怎样决定，人自己依然可以，而且应该，尽自己底力量，作自己所认为应该作的事情，不必去管结果是成功或是失败。他自己就是，“知其不可而为之”（“论语”“宪问”）。他又认为人底道德品质是完全可以依靠人自己底努力而完成，不受天命底限制。他说，“仁远乎哉，我欲仁，斯仁至矣”（“论语”“述而”），这是对于人底主观能动性的认识，也是对于“天”和“命”底权威的一种限制。孔子认为，至少在道德范围内，人底主观能动性是完全可以自由发挥的。
    在儒家底体系里，“天”占最高的地位。在道家的体系中，天底地位被压低了，天之上还有道。老子书中说，“吾不知谁之子，象帝之先”，（四章）这个帝就是上帝。他说道“不知谁之子”，那就是说它是最初的东西，“在帝之先”即在上帝之先。当然老子并不承认有上帝，他是明确地否认有主宰之天的。这句话只是说，假使有上帝的话，道也是在他之先的。当然，如果有一物在他之先，他也就不成其为上帝了。老子书中又说，“人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然”（二十五章），这也是说，道比天底地位高。关于老子所谓道底意义，近来大家有不同的解释。照同意道是一种物质性的东西底看法，老子说过：“有物混成先天地生”，这个“混成”的“物”大概就是我们于下文所讲的“气”或“精”。庄子书中所说到的“天”，有时就是自然底意思。“庄子”“秋水篇”说：“牛马四足是谓天”，“络马首穿牛鼻是谓人。”这所谓的天即自然底意思。这是很清楚的。不过此所谓天，不是一个东西，而只是一种性质。
    在这种唯物主义底攻击下，在孟子思想体系中，“天”由宗教底意义转化为唯心主义底意义，得到了一种比较细致的形式。在孟子思想中，“天”成为世界底道德原则，有时也有主宰底意义。孟子底唯心主义把社会底道德原则加于自然界，认为世界是一个道德的世界，其最高的原则就是“天”，其表现于人的即是“性”。所以“性无不善”，因此“知性”也就能“知天”（“孟子”“尽心上”）。
    孟子发挥了孔子所提倡的人底主观能动性。他说，“莫之致而至者命也”（孟子“万章上”），又说，“莫非命也，顺受其正。是故知命者不立乎岩墙之下。尽其道而死者，正命也。桎梏死者，非正命也”（孟子“尽心上”）。意思就是说，人必须已经尽其力之所能为，以后的遭遇才是“莫之致而至者”。如果力有所未尽，则任何遭遇，都不能归之于命。假如有一个将要倒坍危险的墙，认为“死生有命”的人，故意地站在它底下面，以至于被压死。这在孟子看来，并不算是知命。此外，孟子还强调人底道德品质，是“求则得之，舍则失之”（同上），与命完全无关。
    在战国末年，唯物主义底发展达到一个高潮。儒家底人，也不得不有一部分转向唯物主义。在荀子底体系中，天仍然占最高的地位，但是他所讲的天实际上就是自然，是独立于人底意志之外的自然界。自然界底运行，他称为“天行”。他认为，自然界底运行有其客观规律，不依人底意志为转移。他说：“天行有常，不为尧存，不为桀亡”（“荀子”“天论”）。这是荀子从上述道家思想中接受过来的影响。
    道家底自然观是唯物主义的，但是在他们底体系中，人底主观能动性是没有地位的。照他们看来，自然界底规律是客观的，必然的。人在这些规律面前只有顺从和屈服，消极地接受和等待命运底安排。庄子说：“知其不可奈何而安之若命，德之至也”（“庄子”“人间世”）。这应该认为是道家思想底一个很大的缺点。
    荀子发挥了儒家思想中所强调的人底主观能动性。他指出，人底任务不在于歌颂自然，而在于控制自然，使其为人服务。他说，“大天而思之，孰与物畜而制之；从天而颂之，孰与制天命而用之”（“荀子”“天论”）。这种向自然作斗争底精神，是道家思想所没有的。
    二、关于“气”的问题
    关于天的问题，以下还要再谈，现在先谈关于气的问题。
    在道家和阴阳家底体系中，气是一种物质性的实体，何以知其为一种物质性的实体呢？因为一般讲气的哲学家都认为气有轻清和重浊两种：轻而清者名为阳，重而浊者名为阴。气既有轻重与清浊这些属性，当然是物质性的东西。气有这两种：其轻清者上浮而为天，其重浊者凝结而为地，推至一切东西都是阴阳之气结合而成的。五行本来指与人底生活有密切关系的五种东西，后来指物质底五种性质或五种自然界底势力，称为 “五德”，也指有五种性质的气，称为“五气”。先秦的阴阳五行家，以阴阳及五行的观念为中心；建立一个唯物主义的自然观系统，以阴阳和“五德”或“五气”底运行，说明自然界中的四时底变化和历史中朝代底更替。
    道家又认为气有细微的一种，称为“精”，所谓精也许就是轻清的阳气。“管子”“内业篇”说：“人之生也，天出其精，地出其形，合此以为人。和乃生，不和不生。”精是由天生出来的，形是由地出来的。“吕氏春秋”说，万物皆有精气，有形气（“尽数”）。老子说，“万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和”（四十二章）。从这些话看起来，他们都认为人底身体是由重浊之气构成的，精神是由轻清之气构成的。
    道家认为这种精气流行于世界之中，高贵的东西都是由精气构成的。“内业篇”说：“凡物之精，此则为生。下生五谷，上为列星。流于天地之间，谓之鬼神。藏于胸中，谓之圣人。”这种精气存在人底身体中，可以自由出入，这是人底生命和智慧底源泉。一个人底身体中，保存的“精”越多，他底生命力就越活跃，智慧也就越大。若“精”完全离开，这个人就死了。（关于这方面的讨论，详见我底“先秦道家所谓道底物质性”一文。“光明日报”“哲学研究”专刊第十三期。1954年9月9日）。
    孟子讲到“气”的地方很多，他讲到“浩然之气”，“平旦之气”，和“夜气”，上文已引“内业篇”说精气“藏于胸中，谓之圣人”。又说：“内藏以为泉源，浩然和平，以为气渊”。似乎道家所谓的“精气”也可称为“浩然之气”。楚辞“远游”篇，“壹气孔神兮，于中夜存”。孟子也说：“夜气不足存”（“告子”）。大概他们所谓“精气”，喜欢清净，人在夜间思虑比较少，所以精气来得多，似乎道家所说的精气，也可以称为“夜气”。因此，也可以称为“平旦之气。”孟子所谓“浩然之气”后来称为“正气”。“远游”篇说，“内省以端操兮，求正气之所由。”是道家也称精气为正气。文天祥“正气歌”说：“天地有正气，杂然赋流形，上则为河岳，下则为日星。于人曰浩然，沛乎塞苍冥。”这些话底意义，跟上所引内业篇底一段正相符合（“远游”篇无论是否屈原所作，其思想是道家思想）。
    由这些称谓看起来，孟子所讲的“气”跟道家所讲的“气”或“精气”是有关系的。郭沫若先生考定“管子”四篇是齐国稷下的道家底学说。孟子也在齐国讲过学，他底哲学思想，受道家底影响。在他底体系里，他用了些道家思想和术语，这也是很自然的，但是这些思想和术语，本来都是唯物主义的。孟子把它拿过来，加以歪曲，使它们为自己的观点服务，使它们成为自己体系里的一部分。
    因此，孟子说的“气”虽然与道家说的“气”有关系，但是，两家所说的“气”有显著的不同。这可以从两点上看出来。
    （1）道家所说的“气”或“精气”是物质性的东西，没有道德的意义。孟子所说的“气”则有道德的意义，例如“夜气”“平旦之气”，都有道德的意义。他所谓“浩然之气”是用“配义与道”底方法“养”出来的；是“集义”，也就是聚许多的道德行为，久而久之，“生”出来的。这虽称为“气”，实际上是一种神秘主义的精神状态。孟子称这种“气”，“塞于天地之间”，把一主观的精神状态夸大为好像客观地存在的东西，应该指出，这是唯心主义者底一贯的作法。
    （2）在道家底体系里，“气”底地位比心底地位高，老子说：“心使气曰强……是谓不道，不道早已”（五十五章）。道家认为“心”底作用是思虑，而“精气”正是怕思虑底烦扰，老子主张，“少思寡欲”，“专气致柔”，因此，用“心”来使“气”是不合乎“道”的。不合乎道的东西，是不能长久存在的。
    庄子说，“勿听之以耳，而听之以心，勿听之以心，而听之以气”（“人间世”），他认为心不能得“道”，只有气才能得“道”。
    在孟子底思想体系里，气底地位比心的地位低（浩然之气除外）。孟子讲不动心底方法有几种，一种是低级的方法，这就是北宫黝、孟施舍所用的方法，其要点是“守气”。孟子在这个地方所说的“气”，可能是物质性的，是指人底生理方面的东西。北宫黝、孟施舍这二位勇士，是凭所谓“血气之勇”，以得到不动心。在孟子看来，这乃是一种低级的得到不动心的方法。如孟子所说的，告子用的是一种比较高级的方法。他的方法是“持其志，无暴其气”（以前的注解说这是孟子底方法，恐怕不对。孟子底方法是养“浩然之气”）。告子底方法根据，是“志，气之帅也；气，体之充也”，“志至焉，气次焉”（以前的注解也认为这是孟子的意见），就是说，“志”比“气”底地位高。孟子自己底方法是养“浩然之气”，照他看来，这是最高的一种方法（关于孟子所论“不动心”底方法，见 “孟子”“公孙丑”）。
    道家要求保持着人所有的“精气”，不让它散失。他们可以说是“求放气”。而孟子则主张 “求放心”。所谓“夜气”和“平旦之气”，只是“存心”底一种条件。
    照此看起来，在孟子底思想体系里，心底地位比气底地位高。“浩然之气”虽称为“气”，而实在并不是物质性的东西，因此就不是道家所说的气了。
    就这样，在孟子思想里，“气”由唯物主义的概念转化为一个唯心主义的概念。
    阴阳也是“易传”底体系中的两个主要概念。但是在这个体系中，阴阳不是两种气，而是两个范畴。这两个范畴表示刚健和柔顺两种性质。它认为有刚健性质的东西，如天、君、父、夫之类都算是阳；柔顺的东西，如地、臣、子、妻之类都算是阴。“一阴一阳之谓道”。照它底说法，天地是自然界底阴阳；君臣、父子、夫妇是社会中的阴阳。它把阴阳抽象化了。阴阳这两个概念，由具体的物质性的气，转化为两个抽象的概念。
    但是我们不能由此就说，易传底体系是唯心主义思想。因为它并没有把这两个概念客观化，阴阳底性质都只能在具体事物中表现出来。照它底体系，在自然界中表现这两种性质的有天地，在社会中表现这两种性质的有君、臣等。它所说的天地就是物质的天地。所以易传底自然观还是唯物主义的。
    易传认为它底六十四卦和三百八十四爻，都代表一种“道”，就是说，都代表一种事物变化所遵循的规律。自然和社会中的事物底规律，都已由它完全包括，更无遗漏，因此一部易经，可以 “范围天地之化而不过，曲成万物而不遗”（系辞上）。它虽然说，它所以能知道这些规律，是由于“仰以观于天文，俯以察于地理”（同上），但是实际上这个规律底体系，是一个虚构的体系，而认为这个体系能包括一切规律，更是一个虚幻思想。这些是易传底唯心主义成分。
    在战国末年，唯物主义底发展，达到了一个高潮。汉代的唯心主义者不得不利用战国时代唯物主义所已得到的成果，加以傅会和歪曲，以配合他底唯心主义的体系。董仲舒就做了这个工作。
    他吸收了阴阳五行家的学说，也吸收了管子“内业”、“白心”等篇中道家关于气和精气的学说（“春秋繁露”“通国身”），他把这些学说综合起来，建立起以气为中心的自然观。他说：“春秋变一谓之元，元犹原也”，“元者为万物之本”，“王英”。他没有说明“元”是物质性的或精神性的。但是后来公羊家认为元就是“气”。何休“公羊传注”说，“变一为元，元者气也。无形以起，有形以分，造起天地，天地之始也”。董仲舒也有元气之称，“天地之气，合而为一，分为阴阳，判为四时，列为五行”（“五行相生”）。他用阴阳五行底运行说明四时底变化。他认为人生活于气中，他说：“天地之间，有阴阳之气，常渐人者，若水常渐鱼也。所以异于水者可见与不可见耳。”（“如天之为”）他是主张“天人感应”的，对于“天人感应”的解释，他有时也采取机械论的观点。“天人感应”，“美事召美类，恶事召恶类”，“物故以类相召”。这犹如“五音比而自鸣，非有神，其数然也”（“同类相动”）。
    董仲舒把先秦关于“气”的唯物主义的学说加以综合，建立起自己的自然观，但是他同时又把这些学说歪曲了，他认为“天……与人相副，以类合之，天人一也”（“阴阳义”），人是有意志有目的的，天亦是有意志有目的的，人有喜怒哀乐，天亦有喜怒哀乐，气亦有喜怒哀乐，“四气者天与人所同有也”（“王道通三”），这就成为神秘主义了。
    董仲舒所说的“天”是自然底神秘化。他把自然之天歪曲了，使他也有主宰之天底意义，成为一种物活论。
    他底“天人感应”说，也是把儒家所强调的人底主观能动性过分夸张底结果，认为人能动天。关于人对于自然的主观能动性，荀子所说是正确的，是科学精神底表现；董仲舒所说是荒谬的，是宗教思想底表现。
    主持作“淮南王书”的淮南王，是当时反对中央集权派底一个代表人物。他反对董仲舒所提倡的中央集权，和统一思想底政策。在这些方面，他都是跟董仲舒相反的。“淮南王书”也是以“气”为中心，建立一世界发生论，但是他也主张“天人感应”。它说，“人主之情，上通于天，故诛暴则多飘风，枉法令则多虫螟，杀不辜则国赤地，令不收则多淫雨”（“天文训”）。不仅君主底行为可以感动上天，照它底说法，即一般个人底行为，也能有类似的结果。它引证师旷作乐，和齐女呼冤底传说，作出结论说：虽“瞽师庶女”，只要“专精厉意，委务积神”，也可以“上通九天激厉至精”（览冥训）。
    董仲舒接受了先秦唯物主义底一些思想，但把它歪曲成为神秘主义。对于先秦的唯物主义底传统来说，这是一种否定。
    这一时期唯物主义思想对于董仲舒及其以后的“谶纬”底神秘主义思想展开了激烈的斗争，其中最有系统的著作是王充底“论衡”。
    王充底唯物主义思想，近来，已有不少的论著，现不需要多谈。现只须指出，王充底主要功绩，在于驳斥了董仲舒及其以后的“谶纬”对于气的歪曲，及其“天人感应”底神秘主义学说。至于董仲舒关于气的学说，他基本上是接受的。他说：“元气未分，浑沌为一，儒书又言，溟涬蒙澒，气未分之类也。”“儒书之言殆有所见”（“论衡”“谈天”），“万物之生皆禀元气”（“言毒篇”），“人未生，在元气之中，既死复归元气”（“论死篇”），“天地合气，万物自生，犹夫妇合气，子自生矣。”（“自然篇”）王充也用阴阳底运行，解释四时底变化。“天道无为，故春不为生，而夏不为长，秋不为成，冬不为藏，阳气自出，物自生长，阴气自起，物自成藏”（“自然篇”）。
    王充对于董仲舒也是很推崇的。他说：“董仲舒说道术奇矣”（“案书篇”），“仲舒之言道德政治，可嘉美也”（同上）。
    对于先秦唯物主义思想，董仲舒底思想是一个否定。王充否定了董仲舒，是否定之否定。但是他对于董仲舒也有所接受。他把董仲舒对于“气”的歪曲驳斥了，接受了其中合理的部分。经过这一廓清，以后讲气的人，就很少再有这种歪曲。
    王充也驳斥了“天人感应”说，认为人不能动天，天也没有目的意志。他说：“夫天，气耶，如气乎，若云烟，如体乎，与地同”（“谈天篇”）。 “谓天自然无为者何？气也，恬淡无欲，无为无事者也”（“自然篇”）。王充由此重新建立哲学中的自然之天底意义。王充以后关于“天”底问题，仍然有不少的讨论，但是这个问题，在以后的哲学思想中，已经不占主要地位了。这就是说，关于这个问题，经过否定之否定，已得到基本上的解决。
    三、关于“心”的问题
    在哲学史中，关于“心”的问题底最主要的困难，是正确认识“心”与“物”底质的分别，恩格斯在“反杜林论”中说：“古希腊罗马哲学是原始的自发的唯物主义。作为自发的唯物主义，它不能阐明思维对物质的关系”（中文本，人民出版社版，第142页）。中国秦汉以前的唯物主义思想，也正是在这个问题上遇见了困难。从殷周以来的宗教都说，一个人死后有它底鬼魂继续存在，这当然是一种迷信。这种迷信是从思维对物质的关系这个问题所引起的，先秦的唯物主义者否认有鬼，打破了这种迷信，但是对于思维和物质的关系这个问题，还没有完全正确的解决。大部分的道家认为“精”是聪明智慧底泉源，这种思想，我们在上面已经讲过。这种思想按一方面说，有唯物主义的意义，但它底错误是把思维认为是物质性的东西，把精神同物质混淆起来。
    这种精神与身体底关系底问题，在后来的几个世纪里，一直成为哲学中的一个重要问题，称为 “形”、“神”问题。桓谭和王充都讨论过这个问题。桓谭说：“精神居形体，犹火之燃烛矣”（“新论形神”“弘明集”卷五）。王充说，“人之精神藏于形体之内，犹粟米在囊槖之中也”（“论衡”“论死篇”）。王充认为精神不能离开形体，这比以前道家的说法，前进了一步；但他仍然认为精神就是精气，是物质性的。
    佛教到了中国以后，形神问题成为拥护佛教的和反对佛教的思想家们中间斗争最激烈的一个问题。宗炳的“明佛论”（一名“神不灭论”）归纳佛教底主要思想为：“精神不灭，人可成佛，心作万有，诸法皆空，宿缘绵邈，亿劫乃报”（“弘明集”卷二）。这里所谓精神就是心。一切东西，包括物质世界，都是心之所作，人死精神不灭，所以能受来世的报应。佛教所讲的因果律和轮回报应，都建筑在“神不灭”这个主张上，他们所谓“神”或“心”是非物质的。专就这一点上说，他们对于思维与物质的关系在一方面，有了比较明确的认识，但是他们在另一方面又犯了更大的错误。他们把心夸大，使其绝对化，反过来把物质性的东西也说成是精神性的东西，由此成为唯心主义。
    桓谭本是主张神灭论的，可是他底比喻在佛教看来，反而成为神不灭论底根据。僧佑说，“君山未闻释氏之教，至薪火之譬，后之言者，乃暗与之会”（“弘明集”卷五）。慧远“沙门不敬王者论”，论“形尽神不灭”说：“火之传于薪，犹神之传于形，火之传异薪，犹神之传异形”，“惑者见形朽于一生，便以谓神情俱丧，犹睹火穷于一木，谓终期都尽耳”（“弘明集”卷五）。
    范缜底“神灭论”认为，精神是身体所发生的作用，“形者神之质，神者形之用”。“神之于质，犹利之于刃，形之于用，犹刃之于利”，又特别指明，“是非之虑，心器所主”（“弘明集”卷五）。他底这种见解，一方面认为精神是身体底作用，一方面又认识到精神并不就是一种物质。于是思维与物质底关系，得到了正确的认识。这种认识是吸收了佛教对于心的一部分认识，在这个基础上，又否定了佛教底关于形神的理论。
    佛教底思想，认为思维和精神是世界底根本，“心作万有”，对于先秦道家至王充的关于精神的学说，是一种否定。范缜底思想对于佛教是否定之否定。
    范缜底正确的见解，结束了关于“形神”问题的辩论，以后谈这个问题的很少。但是关于心的问题，仍然继续是中国哲学中的主要问题。唯心主义对于心的夸大和曲解，是有深厚的认识论的根源和阶级根源。在一个问题上遇到了唯物主义的打击，它就在另一问题上表现出来。
    四、关于“理”的问题
    唐末以后，占统治地位的哲学思想是道学。道学中的主要问题是“理”、“气”、“心”那个是第一性底问题。
   “理”也是中国哲学中的一个重要概念，可是它底意义也是逐渐丰富起来的。孟子说：“理义之悦我心，犹刍豢之悦我口”（“告子上”），孟子所说的理主要是道德原则”。“韩非子”“解老”说：“理者成物之文，万物皆异理。”韩非所说的“理”，主要是指自然界中的东西底性质和法则，后来佛教华严宗讲四个法界，一是理法界，二是事法界，三是理事无碍法界，四是事事无碍法界。他们所谓理，就是所谓心底本体，事就是心所表现的现象。后来宋、明道学所说的理，包括了上面所说的各种意义，不过程、朱这一派所讲的理，是注重道德原则和自然法则底意义，陆、王一派所讲的理，是注重心底本体底意义。
    道家所讲的关于“气”和“精气”的思想，在道教中保存起来。道教底主要思想还是认为人底身体中有精气，能保住精气，人就可以长生不死。因此道教也要求人出家修炼，以达到长生不死底目的。宋明道学反对佛家和道家，即他们所说的“二氏”。可是他们中间有很多思想是从“二氏”中吸收过来的。他们可以说是，能向敌人学习又能划清敌我底界限。他们底主要立场是肯定现实的生活，肯定人生。在这点上，他们和“二氏”展开了不调和的斗争。
    宋明道学在开始时是用一种唯物主义思想反对佛家底唯心主义思想。周敦颐从道教中得到太极图，并且给它一个新的解释。张载也用气底聚散解释物底生灭。他底哲学思想基本上是唯物主义的。
    不过他还有未回答的问题。他认为物都是气之聚，但对于事物底千差万别，没有解释。例如桌子、树都是气之聚，但是桌子和树为什么不同呢？张载没有明确的回答。这个还没有明确地回答的问题，程、朱一派给回答了。他们也认为万物是气之聚，但只有气还不能说明事物底千差万别；还必须有理。理就是法则和规律，气之聚并不是乱七八糟地聚，而是按着一定规律聚起来的。气按着一定规律聚起来是一种事物，气按着另一种规律聚起来便是另一种事物。他们就这样回答了张载所遗留下来的问题。
    程、朱派也是反对佛教的，他们不仅认为客观世界是独立于人的意志而存在的，而且也认为客观世界底规律也是客观存在的。这是正确的，并没有超出唯物主义底范围。程、朱之所以倒向唯心主义是在于他们认为理可以先于具体的事物而存在。有人认为程、朱是理气二元论，这是不恰当的。因为在程、朱，理气并不是平等的，而是有主从。按程、朱底看法，理是主，气是从。这里有两个问题，一是理气先后问题，一为理事先后问题。理与事底关系是一般与特殊底关系，也是规律与事物底关系。理是一般，是一类东西底规律和本质，事是指那一类中的特殊事物。规律存在于事物之中，一般存在特殊之中。但程、朱却把理底重要性加以夸张，认为“理在事先”或“理在事上”。关于理气先后底问题，程、朱并没有肯定理在气先，程、朱认为理是永恒的，气是无始无终的。因此不能说理气两者哪个在先，哪个在后。不过程、朱认为按道理讲理是在先的，实际上他们把理看做主要的，因此他们就倒向客观唯心主义。
    王夫之又回复到张载，继承他底唯物主义，但他并不是简单地回复。他批判了程、朱，但也接受了程、朱体系中的合理部分。他主张“理在气中”“道在器中”，其意义就是，一般在特殊之中，不能离开特殊而单独存在，规律在物质之中，不能离开物质而单独存在。
    程、朱在关于“理”的这个问题上，倒向唯心主义，否定了周张底唯物主义。王夫之又在这个问题上否定了程、朱。王夫之底思想，在这个问题底发展中，是否定之否定。
    在程、朱底系统中，心不占主要地位，他们认为心也是一种具体的东西，是理和气结合所生的东西。照他们底说法，有知觉灵明之理，气和这种理结合起来就成为心，所以同理和气比较起来，心不是基本的，而是派生的东西。我们现在说，心是一定组织的物质所发生的作用，程、朱对于心的看法与我们底看法比较接近，可是他们底这种看法受到陆王这一派的主观唯心主义者底反对。陆、王一派认为心是最基本的，他们称为“本心”，即本来最先存在的，他们在关于理气的问题上，认为理不能离开气而独立存在，但是在关于心的问题上，他们认为心是第一性的。例如黄宗羲认为理总是气之理，不能离开气单独存在，就这个问题上说，他底思想是接近唯物主义的。近来有人认为黄宗羲底思想是唯物主义的，大概就是根据这一点说的。但是，他又说：“盈天地皆心也”（“明儒学案”序），就这一点说，他底思想又是唯心主义的。但是，他对于“心”有一种新的看法。
    程、朱对于心，有比较正确的看法，认为如同其它特殊事物一样，心也是理与气配合底产物。但是他们在另一方面对心的看法，也还是错误的。他们也还是认为，有一个似乎本来就是全知全能的心。朱熹说，心是“具众理而应万事”，“人人有一太极，物物有一太极”。照他底系统，太极就是一切理底全体，人所具的太极就在人底心中。朱熹一方面认为“天下之物莫不有理”。人心可以知道这些理，知道得多了，可以“一旦豁然贯通”（“大学”格物补传），在这时候，一切理都可以明白了，其所以能为此，就是因为照他底说法，心中本来有一太极，本来“具众理而应万事”。
    陆、王派对程、朱关于心的这一方面的看法，不会有太不相同的意见。他们同程、朱的主要不同，在于他们不承认理是第一性的，而认为心是第一性的。这个第一性的心，本来是全知全能的，本来就是无可增损，这个心他们称为本心，或本体。
    黄宗羲对于心的新的看法在于他认为：“心无本体，工夫所至，即其本体”（“明儒学案”序）。这就是说，心是发展的，没有一个原来就是全知全能的心。这种对于心的看法是发源于刘宗周和陈确，但是到黄宗羲才这样明确地表示出来。所谓“工夫”是道德修养底工夫，因此这个命题在自然观方面的意义，为其在道德修养方面的意义所掩盖了。其实在宋明道学底系统中，他们所谓“本体”在自然观方面的意义和其在道德修养方面的意义，是紧密地联系在一起的。如果他们在道德修养方面所说的心“无本体”是发展的，其涵义也就是，在自然观方面的心，也是“无本体”，是发展的。这种对于心的见解，其实就是对于唯心主义在一定程度上的否定。
    在道学关于理的问题上，王船山作了否定之否定。在关于心的问题上，黄宗羲作了否定之否定，不过在黄宗羲底系统中，唯心主义的成分还是很大的，他所作的否定之否定，没有王船山明确，也没有王船山显著。
    结束语
    以上略论中国哲学底几个主要问题底发展和变化。从这些过程中，我们可以看出来，中国哲学史底主要内容，是唯物主义和唯心主义底斗争。这本是我们近来常说的一句话。但是，至少就我个人说，这句话是从日丹诺夫底哲学史底定义演绎出来的，其内容比较空洞。因此也有人对于这句话表示怀疑。经过上面的讨论，这句话就不是一句空话，而是有其确实的内容。
    恩格斯说：“辩证法是关于普遍联系的科学。主要的规律：量和质的转化——两极对立物的相互渗透和它们达到极端时的相互转化，——由矛盾所引起的发展，或否定之否定，——发展的螺旋形式。”（“自然辩证法”中文本，人民出版社版，第一页）上面所作的分析，证实了恩格斯底这段名言。中国哲学史底发展，是辩证的。在其中唯物主义与唯心主义这两个两极对立物确实是相互渗透，相互转化。经过否定之否定，作螺旋形式的发展。把唯物主义和唯心主义看成是两条直线平行地发展，认为其中只有“两军对垒”的斗争，没有统一底一面，这是把哲学史简单化，不合乎事实。当然，过分强调这一面，把它放在主要的地位，也是不合事实的。
    黑格尔把哲学史比做圆圈，他说：“这个圆圈的边沿又是许多圆圈”。列宁说，这是“一个非常深刻而确切的比喻”。（“哲学笔记”中文本，人民出版社版，第249页）在“谈谈辩证法问题”中，列宁也谈到西方哲学史上的“圆圈”（同上第364页）。
    上面所说的中国哲学史中的几个否定之否定底过程，也就是中国哲学史中的圆圈。这个所谓圆圈，是螺旋式的圆圈，否定之否定并不是又回到原来地位，不是又把原来的东西原封不动地拿回来，而是比原来又升高了一级。
