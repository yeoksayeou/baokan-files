Arriving at Tiananmen with New Achievements
By Our Reporter

Today – May 1st, 1957 – the capital's most outstanding workers, farmers, intellectuals, students, industrialists and businessmen, and government officials gather at Tiananmen Square, bringing with them their tremendous work achievements of the past year, to be reviewed by Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov.

Since April 22nd, many news items have appeared in Beijing newspapers: "Mentougou Coal Mine Completes April Coal Production Plan 11 Days Ahead of Schedule and Exceeding Target" and "Casting Workers at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Create Highest Daily Casting Output Since Factory's Founding on the 25th."

The employees of the Beijing Trolleybus Company have prepared two large charts to participate in this year's May Day parade. One depicts the new routes for 1957. The other shows the numbers the company plans to achieve this year. Comrade Zhao Zengshan from the company said, "We will definitely be able to complete this plan because it was carefully formulated by the masses after thorough discussion."

The engineering and technical personnel of the Beijing Radio Management Office will report their work achievements to everyone at Tiananmen. They have proposed twenty-five major technical improvements in this year's campaign to increase production and practice thrift. These improvements alone will save the state 310,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 32,000 yuan in foreign exchange in the last three quarters of this year!

The engineering and technical personnel of the First Automobile Accessories Factory have never been so happy; they are about to successfully test a carburetor that can be installed on more than twenty types of cars produced in different countries. They will tell everyone the good news on May Day.

Beijing State-owned Cotton Mills No. 1 and No. 2 also have good results. They are using cotton rationally and making use of cotton scraps, which can save 180,000 kilograms of cotton a year!

In the first quarter of this year, Beijing's total industrial output value increased by 20.3% compared to the same period last year.

The ranks of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing will be even larger than in previous years. They are full of confidence in completing the 1957 production increase plan, and they are determined to increase the average grain yield per mu by more than 50 jin compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952. Before May Day, more than 400 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs were busy with spring planting, taking this as a gift to the May Day festival. The members of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative have already finished planting cotton, and they have selected the most outstanding workers to participate in the May Day parade. Vegetables in the cold frames and greenhouses of the Sijiqing Agricultural Cooperative are ripening in large quantities before May Day. They are transporting carts of cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach, and other vegetables to Beijing every day to meet the needs of citizens during the May Day holiday.

A production competition is underway in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative. This competition was launched "to celebrate the May Day International Labor Day and to welcome Chairman Voroshilov." When they thought that this year on May Day, standing on Tiananmen to review them would not only be their beloved Chairman Mao, but also Chairman Voroshilov, representing the great Soviet people, they were sincerely grateful and willing to express with practical actions that they were worthy of being members of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative. A few days before May Day, they held a meeting of cooperative member representatives and decided that the entire cooperative would launch a planting high tide on May Day. More than thirty cooperative cadres who had been detached from production went deep into the production teams to produce together with the members.

Many people from industrial and commercial circles, walking in the parade, are determined to "become truly self-reliant laborers in the near future and join the ranks of the working class as soon as possible." The industrial and commercial circles have been one of the most changed classes in the past year or so. In 1956, 8,097 private individuals in the city's industrial sectors participated in socialist competitions, accounting for 82.84% of all private individuals in this sector; among them, 3,054 people received various awards, and 573 people received the glorious title of advanced worker or advanced producer. Many people have contributed their years of accumulated production management experience and technical skills to the country and the people. Xue Yong, the deputy director of the jointly owned Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory, had only researched and manufactured three new products in the more than ten years he had been managing medical equipment before the joint ownership. After the joint ownership, he researched and manufactured nine new products that had not been produced in China together with the workers in the socialist competition movement and won a second-class award.

Students happily participated in the parade as in previous years. They received labor production education in schools and have a more comprehensive view of learning, further education, and production. A student named Zhang Fu from the No. 20 Boys' Middle School said that he would graduate from junior high school this year and would go to the countryside to produce if he could not go to a higher school.

The 4,000 actors participating in the art and literature contingent implemented the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, and the performances they rehearsed were far more rich and colorful than in previous years. The "Hundred-Leaf Dragon" from Zhejiang folk art resembles a beautiful lotus flower when resting, and when flying, it is a strong and vigorous dragon. The "Flower Cymbal Drum," which has been circulating in Beijing folk art for more than twenty years, is lively and powerful. The "Umbrella and Fan Dance" is like a lake of spring water, rippling with blooming flowers.

Fewer government officials participated in this year's May Day parade than last year. Due to the implementation of "cadre transfer to lower levels," many people went to other cities and villages to celebrate May Day. Only a few dozen people from the Central Committee of the CCP National Government participated in the parade. In accordance with the spirit of the central government's streamlining of institutions, this agency reduced its staff by 39.7% this year. Due to changes in working methods and simplified work procedures, 91 people took over the work of more than 150 people before, and they did a very good job. The transferred personnel included senior cadres and odd-job workers, and they are now happily producing in Gansu, Heilongjiang, and other places. (Attached picture)

    带着新成就来到天安门
    本报记者
    今天——1957年的“五一”，首都最优秀的工人、农民、知识分子、学生、工商业者、机关干部齐集天安门广场，带着自己一年来巨大的工作成绩，接受毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席的检阅。
    从4月22日开始，北京的报上就出现了许多新闻：“门头沟煤矿提前十一天超额完成4月份原煤计划”“石景山钢铁厂的铸造工人在25日创造了建厂以来铸管产量的最高纪录”。
    北京市电车公司的职工准备了两个大图表，参加今年的“五一”游行。一个画着1957年的新路线。一个上面写着今年公司计划完成的数字。公司的赵增山同志说，这计划我们一定能完成，因为这计划是群众仔细讨论后订出来的。
    北京无线电管理处的工程技术人员要在天安门向大家报告他们的工作成绩。他们在今年的增产节约运动中提了二十五项重大技术改进。这些改进，光今年后三个季度就可给国家省三十一万度电！省三万二千元的外汇！
    第一汽车附件厂的工程技术人员从来没有这么高兴过，他们就要试验成功一种化油器，这种化油器可以安装在二十几种不同国家出产的汽车上。他们要在“五一”那天把这个好消息告诉大家。
    北京国棉一、二厂的成绩也不错。他们合理使用棉花，利用下脚棉，一年就可省十八万公斤棉花！
    今年第一季度，北京工业总产值比去年同期增加了20.3％。
    北京郊区农民的队伍将比往年更加壮大。他们对完成1957年的增产计划充满信心，他们决心把每亩土地的粮食平均产量比大丰收的1952年提高五十多斤。“五一”前夕，郊区四百多个农业社紧张进行春季播种，拿这个作为向“五一”节的献礼。和平农业社的社员们已经把棉花播种完了，他们选出劳动最出色的人来参加“五一”游行。四季青农业社今年的冷床和温室里的蔬菜都在“五一”前大量成熟。他们每天把成车成车的黄瓜、蕃茄、菠菜等蔬菜运进北京市，在“五一”节市民的需要。
    在中苏友好农业社里，正在开展着生产竞赛。这个竞赛是“为了庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，为了欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席而发起的。当他们想到今年“五一”站在天安门上检阅自己的，不仅有敬爱的毛主席，而且有代表伟大的苏联人民的伏罗希洛夫主席的时候，他们衷心感激，愿意用实际行动来表示自己无愧于“中苏友好”农业社的社员。“五一”前几天，他们召开了社员代表会议，决定全社在“五一”掀起一个播种高潮。三十多个脱离生产的社干部，都深入到生产队里和社员一起生产去了。
    走在游行队伍中的许多工商界人士，决心要在不久的将来，“变成真正自食其力的劳动者，早日到工人阶级队伍中来。”这一年多来，工商界是变化最大的阶层之一。1956年，全市工业行业中有八千零九十七个私方人员参加社会主义竞赛，占这个行业全体私方人员的82.84％；其中三千零五十四人获得了各种不同的奖励，五百七十三人获得了先进工作者或先进生产者的光荣称号。许多人把自己多年积累的生产管理经验和技术才能贡献给国家和人民。公私合营五华医疗器械厂副厂长薛涌，合营前经营医疗器械十几年，只研究、制造过三种新产品。合营以后，他在社会主义竞赛运动中，和工人一起研究，制造了九种国内没有生产过的新产品，获得了乙等奖。
    学生们像往年一样高兴地参加游行。他们在学校中接受了劳动生产的教育，对学习、升学、生产的看法更全面了。男二十中一位名叫张怫的同学说，今年他在初三毕业，要是升不了学，就要去农村生产。
    参加文艺大队的四千名演员贯彻执行“百花齐放”的方针，排演的节目远比往年丰富多彩，浙江民间的“百叶龙”在休息的时候像一朵秀丽的荷花，飞舞起来就是一条矫健的长龙。流传在北京民间二十多年的“花钹大鼓”，活泼而有力。“伞扇舞”仿佛一湖春水，荡起朵朵鲜花。
    今年参加“五一”游行的机关干部比去年少。由于实行“干部下放”，许多人到别的城乡庆祝“五一”去了。中共中央国家机关委员会参加游行的只有几十人。这个机关根据中央精简机构的精神，今年减少39.7％的人员，由于改变了工作方法，简化了工作手续，九十一个人把以前一百五十多人的工作全包下来，而且作的很好。下调的人员有高级干部，也有勤杂人员，他们现在正在甘肃、黑龙江等地愉快地生产。（附图片）
