This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, May 2nd: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on the afternoon of May 2nd, deciding to immediately launch a rectification movement throughout the province, starting with the Provincial Committee and provincial-level agencies. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the meeting decided that it is essential to conduct rectification while simultaneously improving work style and delving into the masses to resolve internal contradictions among the people.

The meeting initially decided that the secretaries of the Provincial Committee Secretariat and the heads of various departments and commissions should dedicate two days per week to rectification study and go into factories and rural grassroots units to deliver reports to the masses, understanding and assisting in handling the contradictions among the people. While engaging in rectification study, the Provincial Committee and Party committees at all levels should continue to convene forums attended by workers, peasants, soldiers, students, intellectuals, democratic parties, and minority nationalities to listen to the opinions of the masses, discover various contradictions, and strengthen ties with the masses.

The attending committee members enthusiastically discussed the issue of key Party and government cadres participating in physical labor. They unanimously agreed that this is a new characteristic of this rectification movement. Whether this rectification movement can thoroughly change the phenomenon of leaders being detached from the masses depends on whether the leading cadres are determined to change their current lifestyles, integrate with the workers and peasants, and continue to maintain and promote the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    一面进行整风  一面改进工作
    本报南京2日电  2日下午，中共江苏省委召开了常委扩大会议，决定立即在全省，首先是在省委和省级机关开展整风运动。根据中共中央的指示，会议决定必须一面整风，一面改进工作作风，深入群众解决人民内部矛盾。
    会议初步决定：省委书记处和各部委的负责人，每星期以两天时间进行整风学习，并深入到工厂、农村基层单位向群众作报告，了解和帮助处理人民内部的矛盾。省委和各级党委在进行整风学习的同时，要继续分别召开有工人、农民、战士、学生、知识分子、民主党派、少数民族人士参加的座谈会，倾听群众意见，发现各种矛盾，加强同群众的联系。
    到会委员热烈讨论了关于党政主要干部参加体力劳动的问题。一致认为，这是这一次整风运动新的特征。这次整风运动能否彻底改变领导人员脱离群众的现象，就看领导干部是否有决心改变目前的生活习惯，同工农群众打成一片，继续保持和发扬同工农兵群众共甘苦的优良传统。
