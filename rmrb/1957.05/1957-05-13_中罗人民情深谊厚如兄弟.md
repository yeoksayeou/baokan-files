The Profound Friendship Between the Chinese and Romanian People is as Deep as Brothers
At the Romanian Ambassador's Reception

Chairman Parvulescu's Speech: Dear Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrade Peng Zhen, Dear Comrades:

	Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest People's Council, to express our deepest gratitude for your gracious invitation and warm reception. We see this as a manifestation of the fraternal friendship of the great Chinese people towards our people.

	We have come to the People's Republic of China with the friendship and fraternal affection of all the working people of the Romanian People's Republic, in order to understand the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people and to learn from your valuable experience in all aspects of socialist construction. The friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people is robust and flourishing, because the spring of humanity—socialism—is deeply rooted in the fertile land of our two countries and unites us in the socialist camp, guiding us to adhere to the principle of "all for one, one for all."

	During our visit, we have had the opportunity to understand the great achievements of the Chinese people. Your progress in industry, agriculture, culture, and improving living standards is remarkable. Your victories in the cause of peaceful construction, like the victories of all countries in the socialist camp, further inspire our people to strive for a new life.

	We have visited important construction projects and institutions in cities such as Beijing, Shenyang, Anshan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Wuhan with great interest, such as the large steel complex, textile factories, shipyards, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, agricultural producers' cooperatives, exhibition halls, universities, historical sites, relics of the revolutionary struggle. At the same time, we have also appreciated your country's beautiful scenery. We have felt the sincere support of the entire Chinese people for the people's democratic government, and their increasingly close unity around the Communist Party and the People's Government.

	In the process of implementing the general line for the transition period, you have put forward many important methods to solve the problems of socialist construction. During this period, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was an event of particular significance. We especially remember your creativity in solving the socialist transformation of agriculture, the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and cooperation with democratic parties. At the same time, we also remember the unique methods you used to resolve contradictions among the people in the struggle to raise the unity of the entire Chinese people to a higher level. These are creative applications of Marxism-Leninism to the conditions of the Chinese revolution.

	The People's Republic of China is a powerful country in the world, enjoying high international prestige. Its firm policy of peace and international cooperation is a powerful factor in ensuring the stability and security of Asia and the world.

	The People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union, has put forward a series of important initiatives to ensure the consolidation of world peace and peaceful cooperation.

	The imperialist groups that pursue a hostile policy towards People's China will never bring any benefit to their own countries or the cause of peace, because without the participation of a country as powerful as China, the serious resolution of any important international issue is unimaginable. Our country, together with all peace-loving countries and forces, has consistently supported China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations and the liberation of China's territory, Taiwan.

	Socialism—the ideal upon which the working people of the world place their hopes—has triumphed in the Soviet Union; in the People's Republic of China, and in the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia, it is advancing victoriously along this path. The imperialist reactionary groups' attempts to split this world that is building and consolidating socialism every day and every hour are in vain. Despite the imperialists' intentions, the unity of the countries in the socialist camp is constantly increasing and consolidating.

	The Romanian people are advancing along the victorious bright road of socialism. In a relatively short period of time, our country has transformed from a backward country into a country with constantly developing socialist industry, agriculture, and flourishing science and culture. Our people are working selflessly to eliminate the difficulties on the road of socialist construction, difficulties that are inherent in progress. At present, our people are joyfully working to implement the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party. Internationally, our government pursues a positive policy of peace and international cooperation. Our people believe that it is their highest task to contribute with all their might to the continuous consolidation of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

	Please allow me to raise my glass
	To the increasing prosperity of the People's Republic of China,
	To the hardworking and talented Chinese people,
	To the fraternal and eternal friendship and fruitful cooperation between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China,
	To the heroic Communist Party of China,
	To the wise leaders of People's China,
	To Chairman Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese people,
	To the health of our beloved Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, and to the health of all of you comrades!

Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech: Dear Ambassador, Dear Comrade Constantin Parvulescu, Comrades and Friends:

	Today, we once again have the opportunity to gather with all the comrades of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest People's Council delegation, and we feel particularly cordial. In a short period of time, the comrades of the delegation visited some of our cities, villages, factories, and schools, and had extensive contacts and cordial talks with people from all walks of life in our country. We thank you for bringing the fraternal friendship of the great Romanian people to the Chinese people. At the same time, we believe that during the visit of the comrades of the delegation, they will personally see the Chinese people's deep fraternal affection for the Romanian people.

	We, the Chinese people, cherish the close friendship and unity with the Romanian people. This friendship and unity is in the interest of the people of China and Romania and the people of all countries in the world. The deeper our friendship and the stronger our unity, the more it will help to promote the socialist construction of our two countries, the more it will strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the more it will safeguard the cause of world peace.

	Dear comrades, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people, I sincerely congratulate the Romanian people on achieving greater and more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Comrades and friends,

	Let us raise our glasses:
	To the unbreakable fraternal friendship and unity between the people of China and Romania,
	To the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,
	To world peace,
	To the health of Comrade Constantin Parvulescu and all the comrades of the delegation,
	To the health of the leading comrades of the Romanian Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej,
	To the health of Comrade Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of Romania!

### 中罗人民情深谊厚如兄弟

    中罗人民情深谊厚如兄弟
    在罗大使的招待会上
    帕伏列斯库主席的讲话亲爱的刘少奇和周恩来同志，亲爱的彭真同志，亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表罗马尼亚国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团的全体同志对你们盛情的邀请和热情的接待表示深深的谢意，我们把它看作是伟大的中国人民对我国人民兄弟友谊的表现。
    我们这次是带着罗马尼亚人民共和国全体劳动人民的友好和兄弟般的情意，为了了解兄弟的中国人民所取得的成就，并学习你们在社会主义建设的各方面的宝贵经验而来到中华人民共和国的。罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的友谊是健壮的、是日益繁荣的，因为人类的春天——社会主义——在我们两国肥沃的土地上是根深蒂固的，并把我们团结在社会主义阵营中，指导我们遵守“人人为我，我为人人”的原则。
    在我们的访问期间，使我们有机会了解中国人民的伟大成就。你们在工业、农业、文化和提高生活水平方面的进步是很显著的。你们在和平的建设事业中所获得的胜利，像社会主义阵营的所有国家的胜利一样，更鼓舞了我国人民为建设新生活而进行斗争。
    我们怀着极大的兴趣参观了北京、沈阳、鞍山、上海、杭州、广州、武汉等城市的重要建设项目和机关，如庞大的钢铁联合厂，纺织工厂、造船厂、武汉的长江大桥、农业生产合作社、展览馆、大学、名胜古迹、革命斗争的遗迹，同时我们也欣赏了贵国的优美风景，我们体会到全体中国人民对人民民主政权的真诚拥护，他们越来越紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围。
    在过渡时期总路线的执行过程中，你们提出了许多重要的办法来解决社会主义建设的问题。在这个时期里，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会是一个具有特殊意义的事件。我们特别牢记着你们在解决农业社会主义改造、资本主义工商业的和平改造，以及与民主党派的合作问题方面的创造性。同时，我们也牢记着你们在为了把全体中国人民的团结一致提到更高的水平所进行的斗争中，解决人民内部矛盾的特有的办法。这些都是创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用到中国革命的条件中。
    中华人民共和国是世界上的强国，享有高度的国际威信，它所奉行的和平和国际合作的坚定政策是保障亚洲和全世界的稳定形势和安全的有力因素。
    中华人民共和国同苏联一道提出了一系列的重要创议来保证全世界和平与和平合作的巩固。
    对人民中国执行敌视政策的帝国主义集团是绝不会给本国与和平事业带来任何好处的，因为没有像中国这样强大的国家参加，任何重要的国际问题的认真解决是不可想像的。我国同所有爱好和平的国家和力量一道，过去和现在都一直支持中国恢复它在联合国的合法地位和解放中国的领土台湾。
    社会主义——全世界劳动人民把自己的希望都寄托在这个理想之上，在苏联获得了胜利；在中华人民共和国，以及在欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家中正在沿着这条道路胜利地前进。帝国主义反动集团妄想分裂这个每日每时都在建设和巩固社会主义的世界的企图是枉然的。尽管帝国主义这样打算，但是社会主义阵营各国的团结一致是在不断地增进和巩固着。
    罗马尼亚人民沿着胜利的社会主义的光明大道前进，在较短的时期内，我国从一个落后的国家变为具有不断发展着的社会主义工业、农业，以及繁荣的科学和文化的国家。我国人民以忘我的劳动来消除在社会主义建设道路上的困难，这些困难是前进中的困难。目前，我国人民欢欣鼓舞地为实现罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会的决议而劳动着。在国际上，我国政府执行和平和国际合作的积极政策。我国人民认为用一切力量为了以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的伟大社会主义阵营的不断巩固作出贡献是他们的最高任务。
    请允许我举杯
    为了中华人民共和国日益繁荣，
    为了勤劳而天才的中国人民，
    为了罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间的兄弟般的、永恒的友谊和富有成果的合作，
    为了英勇的中国共产党，
    为了人民中国的英明领袖，
    为了中国人民久经考验的领袖毛泽东主席，
    为了我们敬爱的刘少奇和周恩来同志，以及你们全体同志的健康而干杯！
    刘少奇委员长的讲话亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的康·帕伏列斯库同志，同志们、朋友们：
    今天，我们又有机会和罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团的全体同志欢聚一堂，感到特别亲切。代表团同志们在短短的时间里，参观访问了我们的一些城市、农村、工厂、学校，同我国各界人士进行了广泛的接触和亲切的交谈，我们感谢你们给中国人民带来了伟大的罗马尼亚人民的兄弟友谊，同时我们相信，在代表团同志们访问的过程中也会亲身看到中国人民对罗马尼亚人民所怀的兄弟的深情厚谊。
    我们中国人民十分珍视同罗马尼亚人民的亲密友谊和团结。这种友谊和团结是符合中、罗两国人民和世界各国人民利益的。我们的友谊越深厚，我们的团结越坚强，就越有利于推进我们两国的社会主义建设，就越会加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结和维护世界和平事业。
    亲爱的同志们，我谨代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和全中国人民衷心地祝贺罗马尼亚人民在社会主义建设事业中获得更大的更光辉的成就。同志们、朋友们，
    让我们举杯：
    为中、罗两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊和团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为康·帕伏列斯库同志和代表团的全体同志们的健康，
    为以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党的领导同志们的健康，
    为罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查同志的健康干杯！
                          （新华社讯）
