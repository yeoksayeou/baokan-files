Xinhua News Agency, 27th: National People's Congress deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) are conducting extensive inspections of various fields of work across the country.

The deputies and members began their inspection activities in twenty-four provinces and cities, as well as the Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions, in mid-April. The scope of the inspections is very broad, and some deputies and members are also conducting special investigations into certain issues based on letters from the people.

NPC deputies Lei Tianjue and Chu Yinghuang inspected the living and working conditions of workers in Harbin and Qiqihar. They believe that the most pressing issues in these two cities are workers' marriage problems and the relationship between the Party and the masses. Because there are more male workers than female workers in these areas, some workers have been living alone for a long time and are unable to marry even at the age of thirty or forty. Lei Tianjue hopes that the government can treat this problem as a contradiction among the people. They also believe that the relationship between the Party and the masses in the factories in these two cities is not normal enough, mainly because many technical leadership positions are held by Party members who do not understand or do not fully understand technology, resulting in incompetence. The personnel selected by various factories to study in the Soviet Union are also Party members and Youth League members who do not understand technology very well. It is difficult for them to learn anything after arriving in the Soviet Union, and they cannot solve problems after returning to China because of their low technical level. In addition, the phenomenon of non-Party leading cadres having positions without power is also very common. Some Party member leading cadres have a rough style and should improve.

After inspecting Qingdao, deputies Wang Jifan, Xian Ying, and member Wang Zhenxin put forward opinions on local aquaculture and the management of sanatorium areas. They believe that kelp cultivation in Qingdao is a new undertaking. The people of the whole country are in great need of this food with special nutritional value, and all parties should support the development of this undertaking. For example, there is an extreme shortage of bamboo poles and palm ropes used for kelp cultivation, and there is a lack of drying equipment and places to dry kelp when a large amount of kelp is harvested. It is suggested that relevant departments study and solve this problem in a timely manner. They also pointed out that some sanatoriums in the Qingdao sanatorium area have extremely low utilization rates, resulting in great waste. Qingdao is currently short of houses, and hospital beds are even more insufficient, but some sanatoriums with complete medical equipment have been idle for a long time, and some only have convalescents in the summer. These sanatoriums are generally managed vertically by central government agencies, industrial trade unions, and military systems, making it difficult for local authorities to unify them. They suggest that relevant central departments establish a unified agency to manage and coordinate them to improve the utilization rate of sanatoriums.

Deputies Huang Changshui and Hong Sisi inspected the education of children of returned overseas Chinese in the Jinjiang Special Zone of Fujian Province. This year, there are more than 58,000 graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools in Jinjiang Special Zone, which is more than any previous year. In addition to a portion entering regular middle schools, a large number of students cannot enter regular middle schools. Local relevant departments are actively taking various measures to solve the problem of schooling for children of returned overseas Chinese. For example, nine middle schools run by overseas Chinese will expand their enrollment, and the number of new students this year will increase by two to three times compared with graduates. The counties are also preparing to increase the number of secondary cultural refresher courses, senior primary school graduation refresher courses, and organize self-study groups. Huang Changshui and Hong Sisi expressed satisfaction with the active measures taken by local relevant departments to solve the schooling problem of children of returned overseas Chinese. They believe that they can also run some refresher courses such as English, accounting, and abacus calculation. Primary schools in key areas with the necessary conditions can be merged to run middle schools, and it is suggested that middle schools in overseas Chinese towns with concentrated populations can try to run a two-shift system to solve the problem of more students entering schools.

Deputy, Lieutenant General Zeng Zesheng, and former Deputy Dean of Northeast Institute of Geology Yu Deyuan conducted an inspection in the Qaidam Basin. They had cordial conversations with workers on the well sites and in the mines, and learned about their production and living conditions. During the inspection, Zeng Zesheng met some of the demobilized officers and soldiers he used to lead. Yu Deyuan met many of his students from the Northeast Institute of Geology. They believe that the relatively clear impression here is that the workers and Party and government leaders are relatively hard-working. Under the conditions of poor climate and relatively monotonous cultural life, they have overcome many difficulties and are working with full spirit, making the desolate appearance of Qaidam change day by day. Zeng Zesheng and Yu Deyuan collected many opinions and suggestions in various places. Some have been reported to relevant departments for processing, and some will be brought back to Beijing to be submitted to relevant central departments.

    全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员
    深入各地广泛视察各方面工作
    据新华社27日讯　全国人民代表大会代表、政协全国委员会委员正在全国各地广泛地视察各方面的工作。
    代表和委员们是4月中旬分别在二十四个省、市以及新疆、内蒙古两个自治区开始视察活动的。视察的范围非常广泛，有些代表和委员还带着人民来信对某些问题进行专门的调查。
    全国人民代表大会代表雷天觉和褚应璜在哈尔滨和齐齐哈尔视察了职工的生活和工作情况。他们认为这两个市最尖锐的问题是工人的婚姻问题和党群关系问题。这些地区因为男工多、女工少，一些工人长期过着独身生活，到了三、四十岁还无法结婚。雷天觉希望政府能把这问题作为一项人民内部矛盾来处理。他们还认为，这两个市工厂中的党群关系还不够正常，主要表现在许多技术领导岗位由不懂或不太懂技术的党员担任，结果力不胜任。各工厂选派留苏学习的人员也都是一些不太懂技术的党员和团员，到苏联后难于学到东西，回国后因为技术水平低，不能解决问题。此外，非党领导干部有职无权现象也很普遍。有些党员领导干部作风粗暴，应该改进。
    代表王季范、鲜英和委员王枕心在青岛视察后，对当地的水产养殖和疗养区的管理等问题提出了意见。他们认为，青岛市的海带养殖是个新事业，全国人民非常需要这种有特殊营养价值的食品，各方面都应该支持这个事业的发展。如现在养殖海带用的竹竿、棕绳极感缺乏，大批海带收获时又缺少烘干设备和晒的地方，建议各有关部门及时研究解决。他们还指出青岛疗养区有些疗养院利用率极低，浪费很大。青岛目前房子紧张，医院床位更感不足，但一些医疗设备完善的疗养院却长期空闲，有的只到夏季才有休养员。这些疗养院一般都属中央机关、各产业工会和军队系统垂直管理，地方难以统一。他们建议中央有关部门成立一个统一的机构来管理，统一调剂，以提高疗养院的利用率。
    代表黄长水、洪丝丝在福建省晋江专区侨乡视察了侨眷子女的教育问题。今年晋江专区高小、初中应届毕业生共有五万八千多人，比以往任何一年都多。除一部分升入正规中学外，有很大部分学生不能升入正规中学。当地有关部门正在积极采取各种措施来解决侨眷子女就学问题，例如有九所侨办中学将扩大招生数，今年的新生将比毕业生增加两倍到三倍。各县还准备增办中等文化补习班、高小毕业补习班和组织自学小组等。黄长水、洪丝丝对当地有关部门积极采取各种措施解决侨眷子女就学问题表示满意。他们认为还可以办一些如英文、会计、珠算补习班，有条件的基点地区小学可以合并办中学，并建议人口集中的侨乡的中学可试办二部制，解决更多的学生升学问题。
    代表、陆军中将曾泽生和原东北地质学院副院长喻德渊在柴达木盆地进行了视察。他们在井场上、在矿洞里和职工们作了亲切的交谈，了解了生产和生活方面的情况。曾泽生在视察中会见了他原来所领导的一些已转业官兵。喻德渊会见了他在东北地质学院的许多学生。他们认为，这里给人一个较为鲜明的印象是职工们和党政负责人都比较艰苦。他们在气候条件较差、文化生活比较枯燥的情况下，克服了许多困难，精神饱满地进行工作，使柴达木的荒凉面貌一天天地有了改变。曾泽生和喻德渊在各地搜集了许多意见和建议，有些已反映给有关部门处理，有些将带回北京向中央有关部门提出。
