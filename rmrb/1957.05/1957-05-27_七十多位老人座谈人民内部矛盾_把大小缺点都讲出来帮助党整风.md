    Over Seventy Elderly People Discuss Internal Contradictions Among the People
    Presenting Both Major and Minor Shortcomings to Help the Party Rectify its Work
    (Our Newspaper's Report) Yesterday morning (26th) at 8:30 AM, over seventy elderly people from the State Council Research Institute of Culture and History held a forum at the CPPCC Auditorium to discuss the issue of internal contradictions among the people. The forum was presided over by Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council. The elderly gentlemen who participated in yesterday's meeting were all members of the State Council Research Institute of Culture and History. Although many of them are over seventy years old, their enthusiasm to speak was no less than that of young people.
    Many people in their speeches expressed excitement and admiration for the unprecedented prosperity of our country, and expressed great gratitude for the care and arrangements made by the state and the Party for the elderly. They made a comparison between the shortcomings and achievements that exist today. Li Peiji, the first to speak, said that he saw the situation of socialist transformation in industry and agriculture in Fujian Province as very good, but not enough attention was paid to the development of handicrafts, and agricultural production cooperatives were too large, with too many cadres detached from production. Yan Youfu particularly emphasized: The Chinese Communist Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is to encourage everyone to take action and speak their minds without reservation. This proves that the revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party has been successful and has the conditions and strength to enable everyone to speak their minds. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the achievements of national construction over the past seven years are all there for everyone to see. Therefore, if we only talk about the bad things about the Communist Party and not the good things, it would be unfair. Now we are helping the Party rectify its work, raising all shortcomings, big or small, in order to correctly handle problems, to turn big problems into small ones, small problems into nothing, and to make everyone progress. We are just like "relying on parents at home and friends when away from home." The new society is our home, and the government and the Party are our parents. But our parents are young and do not have much experience in managing the household. We, as older children, should understand the difficulties of our parents and help them do things well.
    Kang Tongbi particularly mentioned that the Party and the government are very respectful and caring for the elderly, but there are still many phenomena of disrespect and even abuse of the elderly in society. They called on the Party and the government to pay attention to the propaganda and education of ethics and morality. Chen Banding also raised the issue of attention to "strengthening the people," believing that strengthening the ideological education of the general workers, peasants, and young people is a very urgent and important issue. Yan Youfu, Li Guanglian, and Chao Gongchang also called on the Party and the League to strengthen the political and ideological education of young people.
    Wen Chenglie said that it is right for us to pay attention to correctly handling internal contradictions in organs, schools, etc., but we cannot ignore the contradictions that exist among the masses of society. He said that the best way to correctly handle such internal contradictions among the people is to help the masses learn, but the current form of street mass organizations is too large to play a role in educating the masses. He suggested replacing the current street mass activity forms that cannot play a significant role with the form of "courtyard neighborhood groups." He believes that "courtyard neighborhood groups" are small in scope, easy to hold meetings, and conducive to detailed study and discussion of issues.
    Feng Fuguang, Luo Jieqiu, and others raised many specific requirements and suggestions on how the Research Institute of Culture and History should improve its work and contribute to society. Huang Youchang and Li Guanglian also put forward opinions on the work of language reform. Liu Zuozhi criticized the bureaucratic work style of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Forests and other organs at the meeting.
    Due to time constraints, many people did not have time to speak at the meeting, and some people submitted written opinions. The forum was temporarily adjourned at 12:00 noon, and the forum will continue.

    七十多位老人座谈人民内部矛盾
    把大小缺点都讲出来帮助党整风
    本报讯　昨（26）日上午八时半，国务院文史研究馆七十余位老人在政协礼堂座谈人民内部矛盾问题。这个座谈会是由国务院副秘书长齐燕铭主持的。参加昨日会议的老先生，都是国务院文史研究馆的馆员。他们好多人虽然已年逾古稀，但要求发言的踊跃之情并不减于青年。
    不少人在发言中对我国呈现了历史上未有的繁荣景象表示兴奋和赞美，对于国家和党对老年人的照顾和安排表示十分感激。对于我们今天存在的缺点和成绩，他们是作了一番比较的。第一个发言的李培基说，他这次在福建省看到工农业社会主义改造的情况很好，只是对手工业发展注意不够，而且农业生产合作社太大，脱产干部太多。阎幼甫特别强调说：中国共产党提出百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，就是要大家行动起来，没有忌讳地把心里话说出来。这证明中国共产党领导的革命已经成功，有条件有力量可以使人人将心里的话都说出来。在中国共产党的领导下，七年来建国的成绩都摆在那里，谁都是看见的，因此，如果我们只说共产党的坏话，不说好话，那是不公平的。现在我们帮助党整风，不管大小缺点都提出来，是为了正确处理问题，为了使大事化小，小事化无，使大家进步。我们正如“在家靠父母，出外靠朋友”，新社会就是家，政府和党就是我们的父母。但是我们的父母年纪轻，当家的经验还不多，我们做大子女的，就应该体谅做父母的苦衷，帮助他把事情做好。
    康同璧特别提到党和政府对老年人是非常尊敬、非常照顾的，但目前社会上不尊敬老年人，甚至虐待老年人的现象仍然不少。他们要求党和政府注意伦理道德的宣传教育工作。陈半丁还提出注意“民强”的问题，他认为加强对一般工农群众青年的思想教育是很迫切的大问题。阎幼甫、李广濂、巢功常也都要求党和团加强对青年的政治思想教育。
    闻承烈说，我们注意正确处理机关、学校等内部矛盾是对的，但是也不能忽视社会群众中存在的矛盾。他说，正确处理这种人民内部矛盾的问题，最好的办法是帮助群众学习，但目前的街道群众组织形式太庞大，不能起教育群众的作用，他建议用“院邻小组”的形式来代替目前存在的不能发挥很大作用的街道群众活动形式，他认为“院邻小组”范围小，开会容易，便于细密学习、讨论问题。
    冯复光、罗介丘等对于文史研究馆应当如何改进工作，为社会贡献出力量来的问题，提出了不少具体的要求和建议。黄右昌、李广濂对文字改革工作也提出了意见。刘?园在会上批评了北京市林园局等机关的官僚主义作风。
    由于时间的限制，许多人未及在会上发言，有一些人提出了书面意见。座谈会到中午十二时暂时宣布结束，座谈仍将继续进行。
