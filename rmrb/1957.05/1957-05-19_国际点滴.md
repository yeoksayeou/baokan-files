	The British Prime Minister's Retirement Pension
	According to British newspapers, after the "Daily Mail" reported that Sir Eden was being treated in an American hospital and could not afford the medical expenses, some British Conservatives blamed the British government, saying that the provision that the Prime Minister's retirement pension was only 2,000 pounds was "undignified." Some even suggested that the Prime Minister's retirement pension should be increased to at least 5,000 pounds. However, would increasing the British Prime Minister's retirement pension really restore the "dignity" of the empire?
		Protecting Murderers
	Not long ago, an American airman stationed in the United Kingdom stabbed a British citizen to death and was sentenced to death by a British military court. However, the American military authorities defended the murderer, arguing that the deceased did not die "from injuries" but died from "improper treatment." As a result, the murderer was only sentenced to one month in prison for "carrying a knife that was too long."

    英国首相的退休年金
    据英国报纸报道，自从“每日邮报”报道了艾登爵士在美国一家医院里治病而付不起医药费之后，英国有些保守党人责备英国政府说，首相的退休年金只有二千英镑的规定是“有失尊严”的。有人还建议应该把首相退休年金至少增加到五千英镑。可是，英国首相退休年金提高，是否就能够恢复帝国的“尊严”了呢？
        庇护杀人犯
    不久以前，驻在英国的一个美国空军刺死了一个英国公民，被英国军事法庭判处死刑。但是美国军事当局却替凶手辩护，理由是死者并非“因伤致死”，而是死于“治疗不当”。结果，凶手只被判了一个月徒刑，罪名是“带了一把太长的小刀”。
