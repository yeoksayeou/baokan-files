Xinhua News Agency report: The state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill officially began production on the 25th.

This is a modern cotton textile mill with both spinning and weaving capabilities, boasting over 86,900 spindles and over 3,600 looms. With the exception of experimental equipment, all machinery was manufactured domestically. According to its designed capacity, this factory can produce over 100 million meters of cotton cloth annually.

The scale of this factory is larger than the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, but its investment amount only accounts for 63.41% of the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill’s investment. Compared to the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, its scale is more than double that of the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, but the investment amount is still less than the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill.

    北京国棉三厂投入生产
    据新华社讯　国营北京第三棉纺织厂25日正式开工生产。
    这是一个自纺自织的现代化棉纺织厂，有八万六千九百多个纱锭，三千六百多台布机；机器设备除试验性的以外，都是我国自制的。按照设计能力，这个厂一年可以生产棉布一亿多公尺。
    这个厂的规模比国棉二厂大，但是投资额只占国棉二厂投资额的63.41％；同国棉一厂相比，规模比国棉一厂大一倍以上，但投资额仍比国棉一厂少。（附图片）
