    The editorial department of the "Drama News" invited Kunqu opera artists and enthusiasts from Beijing for a symposium on the afternoon of the 16th. Comrade Kang Sheng also attended the meeting.

    Since the performance of the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Kunqu opera has attracted attention from all sides, but for more than a year, this flower of Kunqu opera has still been subjected to undue indifference from the cultural leadership departments. Bai Yunsheng said: "Some people always feel that Kunqu opera is something of the literati and the declining classes. I have mentioned the importance of Kunqu opera on many occasions, and I am considered to have bad thoughts, be a restorationist, and nostalgic for the old society. After the symposium on 'Fifteen Strings of Cash,' it was said that a Kunqu Opera Theater would be established, but so far it is only the Northern Kunqu Opera Delegation that went to the Shanghai Performance. We requested that the delegation be changed to a theater, and the leadership said it would consider it. I went to the Ministry of Culture to cry, but it still has not been established." Han Shichang said: "The Ministry of Culture is not actively supporting our establishment of a theater. The staff size has been reduced from 120 to 70, but the Opera House has 70 people in the orchestra alone and it is not reduced. Funding has also been repeatedly reduced, and now we don't even have a place to live or a house. The lack of manpower makes it impossible for Kunqu opera to meet the audience for a long time, and the Northern Kunqu's traditional repertoire 'The Story of a Hundred Flowers' cannot be rehearsed." Hou Yongkui said: "The supporting roles are not complete. I can only perform 'Night Flight' now, and I can't perform any other plays. The leadership said that if big plays can't be performed, perform small plays, and if small plays can't be performed, study and research. This is such a great loss to the art."
    The lack of talent in the Kunqu opera orchestra and the lack of successors are very serious. Flute player Gao Jingchi said: "We only have five people doing music in Northern Kunqu now, four of whom are over sixty years old. We haven't taken a single apprentice. It is more difficult to train a musician than an actor, it takes ten or eight years. We originally planned to take some apprentices to train them, but the leadership said, no, this is the system." Young actors Liang Shou Xuan and Kong Zhao said that they would study hard and inherit all the heritage of the old Kunqu opera artists. However, many artists, such as Shen Pansheng and Xu Huiru, work in the China Pingju Opera House, etc. Although the work is not suitable for them, they cannot be transferred, so they cannot learn better. At the meeting, others such as Yu Pingbo, Zhang Boju, Fu Xueyi, Liu Changyi, Ye Yangyi, Ma Xianglin, Ikexian, Qian Yiyu, and Zhang Qixiang put forward their own views and suggestions on the genre and development of Kunqu opera art, and the care of veteran artists.
    Finally, Comrade Kang Sheng made a speech and put forward three points: He said that first of all, everyone should have confidence, and the future of Kunqu opera is optimistic. Although there are many difficulties now, they can certainly be overcome. Young actors should have more confidence in learning Kunqu opera and persevere. Secondly, the Kunqu opera circles should be closely united, regardless of north and south, region, occupation, or amateur status, and unite all people who love Kunqu opera in fraternal opera troupes, cultural groups, and schools to work together to promote the art of Kunqu opera. Third, it is necessary to win the support of the broad masses of people. In the future, we must perform more and meet with the masses more often. Amateur actors should also perform more. Drama and art publications and newspapers should also publicize more. There are too few such articles now.

### 昆曲界要求扶植  文化部冷若冰霜

    昆曲界要求扶植  文化部冷若冰霜
    本报讯　16日下午，戏剧报编辑部邀请了北京一些昆曲艺人和昆曲爱好者举行座谈。康生同志也参加了这个会。
    自从昆曲“十五贯”演出以来，昆曲已引起了各方面的重视，但一年多来昆曲这朵花仍然受到文化领导部门不应有的冷淡。白云生说：“有人总觉得昆曲是士大夫、没落阶级的东西。我在很多场合提到要重视昆曲，被人认为思想不良，复古主义，留恋旧社会等。‘十五贯’的座谈会后，就说要成立昆曲剧院，可是至今却还只是个去上海会演的北方昆曲代表团。我们要求把团改为剧院，领导上说要考虑，我曾去文化部哭诉，但还是迟迟不能成立。”韩世昌说：“文化部对我们要成立剧院不积极支持，编制从一百二十人一直减到七十人，歌剧院光乐队就有七十人但不减少。经费也一再削减，到现在我们连住的地方、房子也没有。人力没有配备，使昆曲长期不能和观众见面，北昆的传统剧目‘百花记’也无法排演。”侯永奎说：“配角不齐，我现在只能演‘夜奔’，别的戏都不能演。领导上说大戏不能演就演小戏，小戏不能演就学习、研究。这对艺术事业是多么大的损失。”
    昆曲乐队人材的缺乏和后继无人的情况是十分严重的。笛师高景池说：“我们北昆现在只有五个搞音乐的，其中四人都已六十多岁了，没有收一个徒弟，培养一个乐师比演员更难，非十年、八年不可。本来准备收一些徒弟来培养，但领导上说，不行，这是制度。”青年演员梁寿萱、孔昭等都表示要好好学习，把昆曲老艺人的遗产全部继承下来，但很多艺人如沈盘生、徐惠如等在中国评剧院等工作，虽然工作对他们并不适合，但就是调不来，使他们也不能更好的学习。会上，其他如俞平伯、张伯驹、傅雪漪、刘厂一、叶仰仪、马祥麟、伊克贤、钱一羽、张琦翔等对昆曲的流派和发展昆曲艺术、照顾老艺人等问题都提出了自己的看法和建议。
    最后，康生同志发言，提出了三点意见：他说首先大家要有信心，昆曲的前途是乐观的。现在困难虽然多，一定可以克服。青年演员学习昆曲更要有信心，要坚持下去。其次，昆剧界应该不分南北，不分地域，不分职业的和业余的，都亲密地团结起来，并团结兄弟剧种、文化团体、学校中一切爱好昆剧的人士，共同为发扬昆剧艺术而努力。再次，要争取广大群众的支持，以后就一定要多演出、多和群众见面，业余演员也要多多演出，戏剧文艺的刊物和报纸，更要多作宣传，现在这样的文章太少了。
