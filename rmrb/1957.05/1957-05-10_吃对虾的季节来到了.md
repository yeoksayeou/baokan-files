The season for eating prawns has arrived.
Prawns are on the market. In Beijing, the average daily market volume of prawns has reached 30,000 jin. This year, the climate has been abnormal, resulting in reduced production and a larger export volume (taking Shandong, the main producing area, as an example, exports reached nearly 1,000 tons by the end of April this year, accounting for slightly less than half of the production), so the price is somewhat higher than the same period last year.

A large number of prawns can be caught along the coasts of Shandong, Hebei, Tianjin, and Liaoning every spring and autumn. The shrimp schools appear earliest in the eastern coastal area in spring. Shrimp fishing begins around mid-to-late March near Shidao. Weihai, Yantai, Longkou, and Laizhou Bay are all famous producing areas, and the fishing season lasts until around June every year. Hebei, Tianjin, and Liaoning have producing areas such as Qikou, Tanggu, Yanghekou, Fuxian, and Zhuanghe. The fishing season is delayed from south to north in turn, and the autumn fishing season in various places shows a reverse change. After autumn, prawns migrate to the central Yellow Sea to overwinter.

Prawns are a specialty of China and are only produced in the northern coastal areas of China. Its annual output can reach 8,000 to 9,000 tons. The highest catch of prawns in one haul by the aquatic product company's fishing boats can reach 24,000 jin. Prawns enjoy a high reputation in the international market. Exporting one ton of fresh prawns can be exchanged for six tons of steel, which is more than twice the value of exporting egg products.

    吃对虾的季节来到了
    对虾上市了。在北京，对虾上市量每天平均达到三万斤。今年气候不够正常，产量减少，出口数量也较多（以主要产区山东来说，截至今年4月底出口将近一千吨，约为产量的一半弱）因此价格较去年同时期高了一些。
    山东、河北、天津、辽宁沿海，每年春、秋季均可捕获大量对虾。春季的东海沿出现虾群最早，石岛附近3月中、下旬即开始虾汛，威海、烟台、龙口、莱州湾均是著名的产地，每年捕获期到6月前后才结束。河北、天津、辽宁有歧口、塘沽、洋河口、复县、庄河等产区。汛期由南向北，依次推迟，各地秋季汛期又呈逆向变化，秋后，对虾游至黄海中部越冬。
    对虾是我国的特产，而且仅产于我国北部沿海地区，它年产量可达八、九千吨，水产公司的渔轮最高一网可捕对虾二万四千斤。对虾在国际市场上享有盛誉，出口鲜对虾一吨，可换回钢材六吨，比出口蛋品价值要高出一倍。
