    Old But Vigorous
    In Cheshire, England, there is a football team composed of elderly people. The total age of the eleven players is seven hundred years. The players are all surrounded by children and grandchildren. Not long ago, this football team invited a youth football team to hold a friendly match, and they insisted on playing the full ninety minutes according to the rules. In the past three months, they have been constantly practicing on weekends and two or three afternoons each week.
