Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th dispatch from TASS: The law on further improving the organization of industrial and construction management, passed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet at its Seventh Session on the 10th, states that the outstanding achievements in the development of the Soviet socialist economy convincingly confirm the correctness of the policies pursued by the Party and the government, and prove the great vitality of Lenin's principles of socialist economic management. On the other hand, in view of the vigorous development of the national economies of the Union and Autonomous Republics, territories and many states, the establishment of large-scale socialist industries, and the unprecedented scale of industrial construction, and in view of the countless professional cadres and scientists who are well-versed in business at the local level, there is an increasingly urgent need to further improve the organizational forms of industrial and construction management, to bring leadership closer to production, and to make leadership more specific and practically effective. Now, it has become necessary to further expand the powers of the Union Republics in economic construction, and to shift the focus of practical leadership over enterprises and construction projects to the local level, to the economic administrative regions. The new management forms can eliminate the localism barriers that hinder the further development of specialization and collaboration in industry, and hinder the fuller utilization of existing potential. The National Economic Councils, organized according to economic administrative regions, should be the basic organizational form for managing industry and construction.
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting approved the measures proposed by the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, and unanimously supported in the national discussion, on further improving the organization of industrial and construction management.
    The law stipulates that the management of industry and construction should be implemented on the basis of economic administrative regions and according to the principle of regions. The economic administrative regions are defined by the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics. In each economic administrative region, a National Economic Council is formed to manage industry and construction.
    The National Economic Councils of the Economic Administrative Regions are composed of the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics and are led by them. The Soviet Council of Ministers leads the National Economic Councils through the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics. The National Economic Council has a Technical and Economic Committee attached to it, which serves as an advisory body.
    The law points out that due to the change in the management of industry and construction, some all-Union ministries should be abolished, including: the Ministry of Automobile Industry, Machine Building, Instrument Making and Automation Tools, Machine Tool Manufacturing and Tool Industry, Construction Machinery and Road Construction Machinery Manufacturing, Construction of Petroleum Industry Enterprises, Tractor and Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing, Transportation Machinery, Heavy Machinery, and Electrical Equipment Industry.
    The Soviet Ministry of Power Stations and the Soviet Ministry of Power Station Construction are merged into the All-Union Ministry of Power Stations. The Soviet Ministry of Defense Industry and the Soviet Ministry of General Machine Building are merged into the All-Union Ministry of Defense Industry.
    The law also stipulates the abolition of some Union-Republic ministries, including: the Ministry of Paper and Wood Processing Industry, the Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Forestry Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the Ministry of Fisheries, the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Construction of Metallurgical and Chemical Industry Enterprises, the Ministry of Construction of Coal Industry Enterprises, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry, and the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry. The relevant ministries of the Union Republics are also abolished accordingly.
    The law stipulates that the enterprises and organizations managed by the abolished ministries shall be transferred to the direct management of the relevant National Economic Councils of the Economic Administrative Regions.
    The following enterprises and organizations of the All-Union Ministries are also transferred to the direct management of the National Economic Councils of the Economic Administrative Regions: the Ministry of Aviation Industry, the Ministry of Defense Industry, the Ministry of Radio Industry, the Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Power Stations. However, these ministries have the power to be responsible for the planning of the relevant industrial sectors and to ensure a high level of technology in the development of production. They shall exercise this power through the National Economic Councils of the Economic Administrative Regions.
    The enterprises managed by the Soviet non-industrial ministries are transferred to the direct management of the relevant National Economic Councils.
    The law stipulates that the State Committee for Long-Term National Economic Planning of the Soviet Council of Ministers shall be reorganized into the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers. The Soviet State Planning Committee shall be the national economic planning agency of the state science. It will comprehensively study the needs of the national economy and formulate current and long-term plans for the development of the national economy; implement a unified and centralized policy in the most important sectors of the development of the national economy, and on this basis ensure the correct arrangement of the country's productive forces and the proportional development of the various sectors of the national economy, as well as formulate plans for the supply of materials and technical equipment for the national economy and ensure supervision over strict compliance with state discipline in the supply of industrial products.
    The law also stipulates that the State Economic Committee for Annual National Economic Plans of the Soviet Council of Ministers (its functions will be performed by the Soviet State Planning Committee and the State Planning Committees of the Union Republics) will be abolished, and the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Soviet Council of Ministers will be established (its task is to study the scientific and technological achievements at home and abroad, as well as advanced production experience, widely publicize these achievements, publish scientific and technological books, and supervise the development and application of new technologies in the national economy), and the State Committee for New Technologies of the Soviet Council of Ministers will be abolished.
    The law deems it appropriate to establish Scientific and Technological Committees of the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics, as well as Scientific and Technological Committees under the National Economic Councils of the Economic Administrative Regions where necessary.
    The law stipulates that the following members shall be added to the Soviet Council of Ministers: the Chairmen of the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics, the Chairman of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and the Director of the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers.
    The various reorganizations stipulated by the law shall be completed before July 1 this year.

    使领导接近生产、更加具体和切实有效
    苏联工业管理改组七月以前完成
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第七次会议在10日通过的关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的法律中说，苏联社会主义经济发展方面的杰出成就十分令人信服地证实了党和政府所执行的政策的正确性，证明了列宁的社会主义经济管理原则的伟大生命力。另一方面，鉴于各加盟和自治共和国、边疆区和许多州的国民经济的蓬勃发展，大规模社会主义工业的建立和工业建设的空前规模，鉴于地方上有无数精通业务的专业干部和科学家，人们越来越感到迫切地需要进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织形式，使领导接近生产，使领导更加具体和切实有效。现在，已经有必要更加扩大加盟共和国在经济建设方面的权力，把对企业和建筑工程的实际领导的重心转移到地方上，转到经济行政区去。新的管理形式可以消除阻碍进一步发展工业中的专业化和协作、阻碍更充分地利用现有潜力的本位主义壁垒。按经济行政区组成的国民经济委员会应当是管理工业和建设的基本组织形式。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议批准苏共中央和部长会议所拟定的、并且在全民讨论中获得一致支持的关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的措施。
    法律规定，工业和建设的管理应在经济行政区的基础上，根据地区的原则来实行。经济行政区由各加盟共和国最高苏维埃划定。在每一个经济行政区内组成国民经济委员会来管理工业和建设。
    经济行政区国民经济委员会由各加盟共和国部长会议组成，并归它们领导。苏联部长会议通过加盟共和国部长会议实行对各国民经济委员会的领导。国民经济委员会之下附设有技术经济委员会，起咨询机关的作用。
    法律指出，由于工业和建设的管理工作的改变，一些全联盟的部应予撤销，其中包括：汽车工业、机器制造、仪器制造和自动化工具、母机制造和工具工业、建筑机器和筑路机器制造、石油工业企业建设、拖拉机和农业机器制造、运输机器、重型机器、电工器材工业等部。
    苏联电站部和苏联电站建设部合并为苏联全联盟电站部。苏联国防工业部和苏联普通机器制造部合并为苏联全联盟国防工业部。
    法律还规定撤销一些联盟兼共和国的部，其中有：造纸和木材加工工业部，城乡建设部、轻工业部、森林工业部、石油工业部、肉乳制品工业部、食品工业部、建筑材料工业部、渔业部、建造部、冶金和化学工业企业建造部，采煤工业企业建设部、采煤工业部、有色金属工业部、钢铁工业部。各加盟共和国的有关的部也相应撤销。
    法律规定，被撤销的部所管理的企业和组织，移交给各有关的经济行政区国民经济委员会直接管理。
    移交给经济行政区国民经济委员会直接管理的还有下列全联盟部的企业和组织：航空工业部、国防工业部、无线电工业部、造船工业部、化学工业部和电站部。但是，这些部拥有负责有关工业部门的计划工作的职权，并且要保证发展生产的高度技术水平。它们应通过经济行政区国民经济委员会实现这种职权。
    苏联各非工业部所管理的企业移交给有关的国民经济委员会直接管理。
    法律规定，把苏联部长会议国民经济长期计划国家委员会改组为苏联部长会议国家计划委员会。苏联国家计划委员会应当是国家科学的国民经济计划机关。它将全面研究国民经济的需求和制定发展国民经济的当前计划和长期计划；在发展国民经济最重要的部门方面执行统一集中的政策，并且在这个基础上保证正确安排国家的生产力和按比例地发展国民经济各部门，以及制定供应国民经济的物资和技术设备的计划和保证实行在供应工业品方面严格遵守国家纪律的监督。
    法律还规定，撤销苏联部长会议国民经济年度计划国家经济委员会（它的职能将由苏联国家计划委员会和各加盟共和国国家计划委员会执行），成立苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会（它的任务是研究国内外科学技术成就以及先进生产经验，广泛宣传这些成就，出版科学技术书籍，监督国民经济中新技术的发展和运用），撤销苏联部长会议国家新技术委员会。
    法律认为，成立各加盟共和国部长会议科学技术委员会，以及在必要的情况下在经济行政区国民经济委员会下设立科学技术委员会是适宜的。
    法律规定，苏联部长会议增添下列成员：各加盟共和国部长会议主席、苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会主席和苏联部长会议中央统计局局长。
    法律所规定的各项改组应在今年7月1日以前完成。
