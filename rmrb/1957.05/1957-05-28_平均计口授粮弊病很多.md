Averaging Grain Distribution by Headcount Has Many Drawbacks
Chen Zhao

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are preparing for the summer harvest distribution. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of grain distribution within cooperatives, for everyone's study and reference.

Last year, the majority of agricultural cooperatives distributed rations to members based on the average headcount of their families. I believe this egalitarian "grain distribution by headcount" method is detrimental to consolidating cooperatives and developing production.

The method of distributing grain equally does not suit the actual needs of people of different ages and labor situations. It is obviously unreasonable to give a strong adult laborer the same amount of grain as a child of only a few years old (or an infant). Currently, the level of agricultural production in our country is still very low. Except for the southern regions of the Yangtze River and the rural areas north of the Great Wall, where grain reserves (i.e., grain remaining in rural areas after state purchase and agricultural taxes) are relatively abundant, grain reserves in other rural areas are still insufficient. The prescribed rural grain standards in these areas are mostly 400 to 500 jin of raw grain, and in some cases only 360 jin. Converted into finished grain, that averages out to a little over one jin per person per day, or even less than one jin. How can a young, strong farmer be satisfied with such a small amount of grain? If the cooperative has a lot of surplus grain besides rations, and the surplus grain is distributed according to more work, more pay, then the young and strong members can also get a portion of grain from the surplus distribution to supplement their insufficient rations. But what if the cooperative has no surplus grain, or very little? In this situation, these members have to buy grain at high prices in the grain market (or even on the black market). According to Ma Conggui, a worker at Shanghai State No. 13 Cotton Mill, the Sisut Agricultural Cooperative in Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, where his family lives, distributes 450 jin of rice per person regardless of age. After husking, each person only gets 27 or 28 jin of rice per month, which is not enough for those who do heavy labor. His family has a 68-year-old father, a 56-year-old mother, and a 22-year-old younger brother. They can only eat a meal of dry rice every five or six days, but even that is not enough, and they still have to buy some grain from families with more children at a price one-third higher than the official price. The more and stronger the labor force in a family, the more watery the food they have to eat. Can this be said to be in accordance with the principle of distribution according to work? Can this encourage the labor enthusiasm of the members?

On the other hand, the method of distributing grain equally greatly benefits families with many children. These people get a lot of grain without much effort. Even if they don't have enough work points, they can get back a dan of grain by paying a few yuan, because they have the "right" to eat that much. Moreover, because children can get the same amount of grain as adults, young couples will rush to have children. When their sons grow up, parents will urge them to get married and have children quickly. When the children are all grown up and it's not enough to eat, they will rush to have more children. It can be seen that the egalitarian grain distribution, in effect, encourages blind increases in births, which runs counter to our advocacy of planned birth control.

Not only that, but the equal distribution of grain also creates and deepens contradictions within the cooperative. It is understood that since last year's distribution, "overspending households" have appeared in cooperatives everywhere. One of the main reasons for overspending is the equal distribution of grain. Because some members with many mouths and few workdays cannot afford to pay for the grain they receive. This has caused difficulties for some cooperatives in lacking working capital, and it has also prevented those members who have done more workdays from receiving all the labor remuneration they deserve, thus becoming so-called "empty distribution households." In this way, rather sharp contradictions have arisen between "overspending households" and "empty distribution households," between "overspending households" and the cooperative, and between "empty distribution households" and the cooperative.

It can be seen that no matter from which aspect, the egalitarian "grain distribution by headcount" method is harmful and not beneficial.

So, how should grain be distributed to be reasonable? A reasonable method is to distribute different amounts of grain to different people according to differences in age and labor situation: those with strong labor and who work well get more grain, and those with weak labor or no labor get less grain. This is called fair and reasonable. According to a survey conducted by the Rural Work Department of the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee in Henan Province in several agricultural cooperatives in Meng County, Hui County, Yanjin County, and Xinxiang County, the members are dissatisfied with the uniform grain standard of 360 jin or 380 jin per person per year. Some people said: "The amount of grain prescribed by the state is enough to eat, but the method of dividing the same amount of grain between young adults and newborns is unreasonable." When the investigators discussed with the members, everyone agreed that, on the premise that it does not exceed the local grain retention and supply standards stipulated by the state, implementing a distribution method of "rationing by person" according to age can guarantee the actual needs of all types of people. The investigators also learned from the masses about the grain needs of people of various ages in the local area: children under two years old need about ten jin per month; those between two and five years old need about fifteen jin per month; those between five and ten years old need about twenty jin per month; and those over ten years old need about thirty-five to forty jin per month. Of course, this number is not necessarily very accurate and can only be used as a reference. The types of grain used and the grain consumption habits of residents in different regions are different, and the amount of grain needed for various people should be determined according to local conditions. In fact, some cooperatives have already done so.

This method of distributing grain "rationing by person" does not contradict the state's "Three Fixes" policy. Because the grain standard stipulated when implementing the "Three Fixes" policy is the average grain standard for the entire population of a rural area, and the government does not stipulate that everyone should receive the same grain ration. At the same time, after implementing the "rationing by person" method of distributing grain, the amount of grain left in the agricultural cooperative will not decrease. However, it should be noted that when adopting this method, attention should be paid to determining the needs of all types of people realistically, so as to avoid the phenomenon of some people not having enough grain and requesting the government to increase the supply.

I am also not absolutely opposed to the method of distributing grain equally by headcount. In those high-yield grain areas, in areas that have achieved bumper harvests, if people see that there is a particularly large surplus of grain and do not care about the small difference in grain distribution, they can avoid the trouble of calculating and distributing grain according to age and labor situation. For example, Hubei Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, and every household in the countryside has abundant grain. It is said that the farmers in this province are not very interested in whether they can get more of this year's summer harvest of wheat (which is also related to the fact that farmers in this region do not like to eat noodles very much). However, such areas with particularly abundant grain are, after all, a minority in the country at present. In most areas, it is more appropriate to implement the method of distributing grain in different grades according to age and labor situation at present.

### 平均计口授粮弊病很多

    平均计口授粮弊病很多
    陈昭
    现在各地农业生产合作社都在准备进行夏收分配。我想借这个机会就合作社内口粮分配的问题谈一点意见，供大家研究参考。
    去年绝大多数农业社的社员口粮，都是按社员家庭人口平均分配的。我认为这种平均主义的“计口授粮”的办法，对于巩固合作社和发展生产是不利的。
    平均分配口粮的办法，不适合各种不同年龄、不同劳动情况的人们的实际需要。让一个劳动力很强的成年人同一个只有几岁的小孩
  （或婴儿）分一般多的口粮，显然不合理。目前我国农业生产水平还很低，除江南地区和长城以北地区农村留粮（即除去统购粮和公粮以后留在农村的粮食）较多以外，其他地区农村的留粮还是不充裕的，这些地区规定的农村口粮标准多的是原粮四百至五百斤，少的只有三百六十斤。折成成品粮，平均每人每天只有一斤多一点，或者不足一斤。一个年轻力壮的农民，只给他这样一点粮食，怎么能够呢？如果合作社除口粮以外还有很多余粮，而余粮又是实行多劳多分的话，那末，年轻力壮的社员还可以从余粮分配中获得一部分粮食，以补口粮之不足。可是，如果合作社没有余粮，或者余粮很少，那怎么办呢？在这种情况下，这部分社员只好出高价到粮食市场上（有的甚至到黑市上）去买一点粮食。据上海国营第十三棉纺厂工人马从贵反映：他家所在的江苏建湖县四树农业社，分配口粮不分大小口，每人都是四百五十斤稻谷。去壳以后，每人每月只有二十七、八斤米，干重劳动的人根本不够吃。他家有六十八岁的父亲和五十六岁的母亲和二十二岁的弟弟，隔五、六天才能吃一顿干饭，但就是这样也还不够，还得以高出牌价三分之一的价格去向小孩多的人家买点粮食。劳动力越多越强的人家，越要吃稀的，这能说是符合按劳取酬的原则吗？这能鼓励社员的劳动积极性吗？
    另一方面，平均分配口粮的办法，使那些小孩多的人家占了很大的便宜。这些人不费力气就得到很多粮食。即使工分不够，他们只要出几元钱，就可以拿回一石粮。因为他们有“权”吃这样多。而且，因为有小孩能和大人一样分粮，所以年纪轻轻的小两口，会赶快生孩子。儿子大了，父母会催他们赶快结婚生孩子。孩子都成人了，不够吃，他们也会赶着再生孩子。可见，平均主义的口粮分配，在客观上起了鼓励盲目地增加生育的作用，而这正与我们提倡有计划地节制生育的精神背道而驰。
    不光是这样，平均分配口粮也制造和加深了合作社内部的矛盾。据了解，去年分配以来，各地合作社普遍出现了“超支户”。超支的主要原因之一，正是口粮的平均分配。因为有些人口多而做劳动日少的社员分得口粮以后，拿不出钱来抵补。这就造成了某些合作社缺少流动资金的困难，也使得那些多做了劳动日的社员拿不到他们应得的全部劳动报酬，因而成了所谓“分空户”。这样，“超支户”和“分空户”、“超支户”和合作社、“分空户”和合作社之间，就发生了相当尖锐的矛盾。
    由此可见，不论从哪方面看，平均主义的“计口授粮”的分配办法是有弊无利的。
    那末，口粮究竟怎样分配才算合理？合理的办法，就是按年龄和劳动情况的差别，对不同的人分给不同数量的口粮：劳动力强、劳动得好的人多分粮，劳动力弱或没有劳动力的人少分一点粮。这才叫做公平合理。据中共河南新乡地委农村工作部在孟县、辉县、延津、新乡等县几个农业社的调查，社员们都对于每人每年三百六十斤或三百八十斤的统一口粮标准不满意。有人说：“国家规定的粮食数量是够吃了，就是让青壮年和刚出生的小孩分一样多的办法不合理。”调查者在同社员们商量的时候，大家都同意：在总算起来不超过国家规定的当地的粮食留量和供应标准的情况下，实行按年龄“以人定量”的分配办法，可以保证各类人的实际需要。调查者也在群众中了解了当地各种年龄的人粮食的需要情况：不满两周岁的小孩，每月十斤左右；二至五岁的，每月十五斤左右；五至十岁的，每月二十斤左右；十岁以上的，每月三十五斤到四十斤。当然，这个数字也不一定就很准确，只能作为参考。各个地区的居民用粮种类、用粮习惯是各不相同的，各地对于各种人的粮食需要量应该因地制宜地加以规定。实际上有些合作社已经这样做了。
    这种“以人定量”的分配口粮的办法，同国家“三定”政策并不抵触。因为在实行“三定”政策时规定的口粮标准，是一个农村地区的全部人口的平均口粮标准，政府并没有规定要所有的人都分得同样的口粮。同时，实行“以人定量”的分配口粮办法以后，农业社留下的粮食也不会减少。不过，需要注意的是，在采用这个办法的时候，要注意把各类人的需要量核定得切合实际，以免发生部分人粮食不足和要求政府增加供应的现象。
    我也不是绝对反对按人口平均分配口粮的办法。在那些粮食高产地区，在获得大丰收的地区，如果人们看到余粮特别多而并不计较口粮分配上的那一点差别的话，就可以免去按年龄和劳动情况计算和分配口粮的麻烦。比如，湖北省去年获得空前大丰收，农村里家家粮食充裕，听说这个省的农民对于能不能多分到今年夏收的小麦就并不十分感兴趣（这也与这个地区农民不大爱吃面有关）。但是，这样粮食特别丰裕的地区，目前在全国来说，毕竟是少数。在大多数地区，目前实行按年龄和劳动情况分等分配口粮的办法是比较妥当的。
