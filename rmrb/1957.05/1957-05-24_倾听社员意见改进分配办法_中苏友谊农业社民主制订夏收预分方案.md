Listening to Members' Opinions to Improve Distribution Methods
    Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative Democratically Formulates Summer Harvest Pre-distribution Plan

    (Our dispatch) Zhengzhou, May 23rd - The Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan, formulated this year's summer pre-distribution plan based on the opinions and demands of its members.

    When the pre-distribution plan was first being formulated, some cooperative cadres believed that the cooperative's income distribution had been done for three or four years, and the method was still the same old routine, so they told the accountant to take care of it! However, the members did not agree with this approach. They urgently demanded improvements to the distribution method and a democratic formulation of the pre-distribution plan.

    After discovering the above contradiction, the cooperative's Party branch immediately convened a meeting of branch committee members and the cooperative's management committee. After discussion, everyone realized that in order to do a good job in distribution, it was necessary to listen to the opinions of the members. Based on this, in addition to holding separate members' representative meetings and members' meetings, various types of members' forums were also held.

    At the meetings, members raised ten suggestions and requirements for improving this year's summer pre-distribution work, in response to the shortcomings of last year's distribution work. For example, in calculating the standard for rations, last year the hard-working members were not well taken care of, so many members had opinions. They demanded that this year, when calculating the standard for rations, in addition to first distributing the retained rations at thirty catties per person per month, the remainder should be distributed according to the actual work points earned by each household's members, and this should be called "more labor, more grain." Another example was the accountant's calculations. Last year, because the accountant's calculation work could not keep up, the distribution often started when the sun set and did not finish until late at night. The members demanded that during this year's wheat season distribution, the accountant should calculate the amount of grain each household member should receive that day before each day's distribution, so that members could get their grain as soon as they arrived, so as not to affect their rest.

    The leaders of this cooperative studied the members' opinions one by one, deemed them to be correct, and formulated the summer pre-distribution plan accordingly. When the pre-distribution plan was announced at the members' meeting, the members were all overjoyed. They said: Our opinions have been accepted by the cooperative. From then on, the members' enthusiasm for production was even higher.

    倾听社员意见改进分配办法
    中苏友谊农业社民主制订夏收预分方案
    本报讯　河南鲁山县中苏友谊农业社，根据社员的意见和要求制订今年夏季预分方案。
    在开始制订预分方案的时候，部分社干部认为，社内收益分配搞过三、四年了，办法还不是老一套，叫会计办办算啦！可是社员们却不同意这样作，他们迫切要求改进分配办法，民主制订预分方案。
    社的党支部发现上述矛盾后，当即召开了支部委员和社的管理委员会议。经过讨论，大家认识到：要想搞好分配工作，必须倾听社员的意见。在这基础上，除分别召开了社员代表大会和社员大会外，还召开了各种类型的社员座谈会。
    会上，社员们针对去年分配工作中的缺点提出了十条改进今年夏季预分工作的意见和要求。例如：在计算口粮的标准上，去年没有很好照顾劳动积极的社员，因此很多社员有意见。他们要求今年在计算口粮标准的时候，除把应留的口粮每人每月先按三十斤分配外，其余的再按各户社员实做工分分配，并把它叫做“劳动多加粮”。再如会计的计算问题，去年由于会计计算工作赶不上，往往从太阳落开始分配到二更天还分配不完。社员们要求在今年麦季分配的时候，会计要在每天分配前就计算好各户社员当天应分的粮食数，社员到场就给他称粮食，免得影响社员休息。
    这个社的领导人员，对社员们的意见逐条作了研究，认为是正确的，并据此制订出夏季预分方案。当预分方案在社员大会上公布的时候，社员们无不兴高采烈，他们说：咱的意见被社里接受了。从此，社员们的生产积极性更高了。
