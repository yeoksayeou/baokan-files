The Central United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China held another round of discussions with leaders of various democratic parties and non-partisan democratic personages after a seven-day hiatus. The discussions resumed yesterday. The morning session featured speeches from Yang Dongcun, Secretary-General of the China Democratic Promotion Association, Ning Wu, Standing Committee Member of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Chen Yuan, a non-partisan democratic personage, Zhang Yunchuan, Executive Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Long Yun, Vice Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and Zhu Shanshan, Standing Committee Member of the China National Democratic Construction Association. The afternoon session included speeches from Liu Wenhui, Liu Fei, and Zhu Shanshan, Standing Committee Members of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Wu Yan, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic Promotion Association, Chen Shaokuan, Vice Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Xu Chubo, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic Promotion Association, Li Junlong, Standing Committee Member of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Luo Zhiwei, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, and Mao Yisheng, Standing Committee Member of the September Third Society. Chen Qiyou and Mao Yisheng also submitted written speeches.

Yang Dongcun believed that one of the reasons why united front work is not done well in many places is that the policy is not understood. He suggested summarizing the history of united front work over the past thirty years and conducting a systematic education on united front policies within the party.

In his speech, Yang Dongcun proposed several suggestions on how to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." He said that democratic parties should be recognized and respected by society and the party, but at the same time, propaganda and education on united front policies should be carried out to remove ideological obstacles and help people understand the role of democratic parties in state affairs, thereby better implementing this policy. Yang Dongcun believed that the reason why united front work is not done well in many places is that the policy is not understood. For example, what is the target of the China Democratic National Construction Association? Many people say it is medical and health workers. What is the target of the China Democratic Promotion Association? Many people also say it is primary and secondary school teachers. Some people even think that the September Third Society is a joint state-private enterprise. For example, when democratic parties try to develop organizations in some units, they are rejected with the excuse, "We already have a democratic party here." Therefore, Yang Dongcun believed that ideological education is crucial for implementing this policy. He proposed four suggestions on how to conduct united front education:

First, he said that the experience of united front work over the past thirty years should be summarized, including the experience of transforming intellectuals and private industrial and commercial enterprises. This is the fundamental solution. Comrade Hu Qiaomu mentioned in the book "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" that united front work is one of the three magic weapons of the revolution. This book has been published for more than six years, and there have been great changes in six years. It is necessary to further summarize and analyze. This summary and analysis is scientific research, and it is Marxist-Leninist scientific research, which includes theory, facts, history, and art. To do a good job in summarizing, the party and democratic parties and non-partisan democratic personages must work together to explain the necessity of united front work, the development and role of democratic parties in various historical periods, and future tasks, etc. Some people say we are eating a meal of unity, and eating a meal of unity is not bad. Do we have to eat a meal of division? Now some people have cut off history and looked at the present in isolation. I think the history of united front work over the past thirty years cannot be cut off. With this summary, the ideological resistance to implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" will be reduced.

Second, Yang Dongcun said that he would not talk about middle schools, but in recent years, political courses in universities have played a certain role, but it is undeniable that there are also many shortcomings. This is dry and dogmatic and has nothing to do with real politics and economics. Moreover, good lectures are written and read word for word, and notes are taken word for word. There is little mention of real life. For example, the Constitution is the fundamental law of our country, but if you ask university students to distinguish between the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference, I think there will not be many who pass. Of course, they know even less about the united front policy. Now the Ministry of Higher Education is drafting a new teaching outline for political courses. Can we consider linking political courses with real politics and economics and giving the united front policy a certain position? I think this will be beneficial for uniting intellectuals and implementing the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

Third, Yang Dongcun talked about the problem of the forum for democratic parties. He said that there is one, and it is the Guangming Daily. In addition, the People's Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Wen Hui Bao have published many articles related to democratic parties. Now everything is published without review, which is good, but it should be strengthened. How to strengthen it? I think that during the current period of free speech, Guangming Daily should publish six editions, not four, so that during the rectification period, everyone can be more active on the forum. Yang Dongcun also suggested that various agencies and schools could set up forums for democratic parties, giving democratic parties the opportunity to speak, especially during the education on united front policies. For example, if a comrade in a certain school misunderstands the united front policy, the matter is not big and does not need to be reported in the newspaper. It can be publicly explained in that school, and once it is explained, it is an education on the united front policy. Of course, I do not advocate bourgeois democracy. Today, the masses' level has been raised, and they can distinguish right from wrong. If someone wants to stir up trouble, they cannot stir up trouble, and they cannot gain favor. How to perform this counter-performance? Yang Dongcun gave a very vivid example. He said that this counter-performance is like the performance of Wu Tieyuan and Tan Xianpei. Wu is learning from Tan, and they are both of the Tan school. Whatever Tan performs, Wu also performs. Today, although we have a forum, it is to learn Marxism-Leninism and take Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology. This is completely different from the bourgeois opposition party and the ruling party's performance of counter-performance. Perhaps someone will make a mistake on the forum, but it doesn't matter. If someone makes a mistake, they can debate, and after debating, right and wrong will come out. In this way, democratic life can be more active.

Fourth, Yang Dongcun suggested that the party should first conduct a systematic education on united front policies. He believed that if this work is done well, it will be very beneficial for implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision."

Finally, to implement this policy, Yang Dongcun proposed three specific suggestions: First, he said that the United Front Work Department requires us to reflect the opinions of the social personages we are in contact with, but after reflecting, there is rarely any follow-up. He hoped that the problems reflected would be solved if they could be solved, and if they could not be solved, there should at least be some follow-up. Second, he suggested that from the central to the local and down to each unit, a series of systems should be established between the party and democratic parties, such as meetings or seminars, personnel, etc. Third, there are many complaints from the cadres of democratic parties at the grassroots level about political treatment. For example, who can read the Reference News? If a certain place stipulates that only those of the 16th rank can read it, while the 18th-rank Secretary-General cannot, is this reasonable? It is worth considering.

Ning Wu said that democratic personages should be "honest friends" of the Communist Party.

In his speech, Ning Wu believed that since the purpose is to help the party rectify its style, individual party members who have made mistakes should be criticized in the attitude of an "honest friend" rather than being protected. He said that only in this way can it meet the party's expectations.

He said that all party members who have made mistakes of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism are manifestations of impure party spirit. Some party members' personalities have completely surpassed their party spirit. Therefore, he suggested that the party central should strengthen the education of party spirit among party members.

He said that from his observations, party members who joined the party before 1949 have stronger party spirit, while those who joined after 1949 have weaker party spirit. He believed that there are currently more than 12 million party members in the country, and there are great differences in the cultivation and tempering of party members. In the past, party members participated in the revolution, risking their lives, while party members after national liberation are not the same. They joined the party happily and gloriously, only with a sense of honor, and they have undergone less hard tempering. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen their education and transformation. He also expressed great surprise at Wang Ming's election as a Central Committee member at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He said that Wang Ming had made very serious mistakes in the past, but as far as he knew, he had not made any self-criticism. He believed that this was a typical case of personality surpassing party spirit.

He also talked about the problem of sectarianism in the work of dealing with intellectuals. He said that currently, there is a fairly widespread phenomenon of discriminating against intellectuals, especially older intellectuals. In colleges and universities, this is particularly serious. Some party cadres have a fixed view of older intellectuals, thinking that they come from the old society, have a dirty history, and have ideological problems. Therefore, they are left there, neither helped to improve nor given appropriate work. As far as I know, those old intellectuals between the ages of 50 and 70, as long as the party and the state understand and care for them, the vast majority of them have high spirits, knowing that they come from the old society and bring a lot of old thoughts and old styles, and are willing to transform themselves and contribute their talents in their later years. When they cannot realize their wishes and feel that they are "eating without working," they are very frustrated. This is also a contradiction: on the one hand, the construction of socialism needs talents and feels a lack of talents; on the other hand, some people cannot fully play their roles. This contradiction is mainly caused by sectarianism. Therefore, he hoped that this problem would be solved through this rectification movement.

Chen Yuan proposed that cadres should be used with confidence and trust to mobilize their enthusiasm.

Chen Yuan first talked about the leadership problem of the Ministry of Education. He said that Beijing Normal University is a higher education institution and is also related to general education. We are directly led by the Ministry of Education and are also related to the Ministry of Higher Education, but due to the lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education, many things are arranged by the Ministry of Higher Education for higher education institutions, sometimes we are not included, which has a bad influence, as if we are both a university and not a university. Some professors say: We are the head of middle schools and the tail of universities, living in the gap. Therefore, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education must coordinate well and pay attention to the special nature of normal universities. Chen Yuan also said that the setting and proportion of courses are not very appropriate. The Ministry of Education sometimes overly believes in educational theories and does not consider practical aspects enough.

Regarding the problem of sectarianism, Chen Yuan believed that the party must pay special attention to it. He believed that the reason why the Communist Party has sectarianism is that in the past, due to the situation of fighting against the enemy, it was necessary to be vigilant at all times, which gradually became a habit. After the founding of the country, the party did not know the situation of cadres nationwide and naturally relied more on politically reliable people, which was completely necessary. However, the main contradiction at present is the contradiction within the people. If sectarianism continues, it will greatly affect the enthusiasm of the masses outside the party, which is equivalent to gradually abandoning various active forces, and the masses will turn from active to passive to bystanders. Chen Yuan believed that under the current situation, cadres must be used with confidence and trust to make bystanders roll up their sleeves and actively participate in construction.

Regarding the trust problem of old teachers, Chen Yuan said that due to the past, many people felt a tendency of distrust, and in the future, more work should be done in this regard. Old intellectuals all have some arrogant temperament and strong self-esteem, "a scholar can be killed but not humiliated." Old professors who have studied for many years, in public, repeatedly make self-criticisms, or in a strong firepower mass meeting, are criticized, sometimes people who originally loved the country, but were pointed at and scolded as counter-revolutionaries, that is certainly to make people feel endless grievances, and emotional wounds are not easily healed. This is understandable. This is about the person involved, but what about other masses? Due to the fact that someone grabbed a few words, even jokes with friends, they were often grabbed and said to have ideological problems, even to the point of questioning their motives. After the movement, everyone dared not speak freely, and when speaking to party and league members, they were even more cautious, and close friends did not come to visit. There was a situation of "saying only three words to a person, not revealing one's heart," forming a situation of outward unity but inward division, sleeping together but dreaming differently. The wall between the party and intellectuals was built in this way in some places.

Learning from past lessons, learning how to correctly handle contradictions within the people.

Chen Yuan then talked about the problem of rectification. He said that generally speaking, the achievements of rectification are still great. The vice-principal of a certain school was mistakenly taken as an object during rectification. The other day he told me: "I was really sad at that time, and my health was also poor. But now, I think calmly, after this movement, the counter-revolutionaries in the country have been basically eliminated, and we can build with peace of mind. This is the greatest achievement. Although I suffered some hardships at that time, from the result, the problem has been clarified, and I have not been wronged." His words moved me very much. I think that during the movement, the masses were mobilized, and many people were injured in the great movement. If we only say that it is unavoidable, it is also a convenient excuse. However, if we think of the country as a whole, these knots can be slightly loosened. Today, learning from past lessons and learning how to correctly handle contradictions within the people, there will no longer be the mistake of mistaking friends for enemies.

The spirit of reforming while inspecting of the Ministry of Higher Education is welcomed by the masses.

Regarding the rectification movement, Chen Yuan believed that although the movement has just begun, many opinions and contradictions have been raised from all aspects. Party leaders at all levels have repeatedly expressed that everyone should speak out freely, and they welcome and support everyone helping the party rectify its style, listening to the opinions of the masses with an open mind. Yesterday, the People's Daily reported that the Ministry of Higher Education accepted correct criticisms and suggestions and decided to adopt a free examination method for sending students abroad. This spirit of reforming while inspecting is welcomed by the masses. This movement itself is unprecedented in ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign history.

Regarding teaching, Chen Yuan believed that some problems should be paid attention to. Some young teachers, who have graduated for only two or three years, read from the book when teaching, which is not good. This situation occurs in our country's cultural undertakings, which are developing rapidly, but the actual number of teachers cannot be immediately filled, and cannot keep up with the situation. These young teachers bravely undertake the heavy burden of teaching with their strength, which is not easy. However, at the same time, there are indeed some people who, due to their political progress, are party members or league members, and their courses are also opened. If they are added with sectarianism in the organization, they will become arrogant and self-satisfied, and old teachers will not be looked at. They think that old teachers teach idealistic things, and only they are the ones who truly grasp Marxism-Leninism, so naturally they will not humbly learn from old teachers. The relationship between the new and the old will gradually deteriorate.

Chen Yuan also talked about the problem of the "wall" between the party and the masses. He said that although there is a "wall," I think it is not the Great Wall of history. First, because the city inside and outside is not the enemy, second, it is also not a continuous wall for thousands of miles, but intermittent, high and low, thick and thin, and in some places, there is no "wall." I think since everyone's situation is different, their views are different, and the styles of the party members they come into contact with are also different, they should say high if it is high, say low if it is low, say it if it exists, and say it does not exist if it does not exist. They should not follow the crowd and seek uniformity.

In previous movements, some people's hearts were left with some impressions, thinking that the more they speak eloquently, the more they can show their activism. It is said that during the rectification movement, some units did not speak at the meeting and were considered unable to stand firmly and draw a clear line. I think this is an individual case. However, some people mistakenly think that speaking three times as much and making thin things thick can show their mistakes. Although this is a very small number of people, there is indeed such a phenomenon.

Chen Yuan believed that criticism should be factual and forceful. Regarding the party's rectification, correcting mistakes, strengthening unity, and improving work, it is beneficial. Sometimes, because of love for the party and maintaining the party's cause, when talking about serious mistakes and shortcomings in work, it is natural to be stern and hate evil like a comrade. This is understandable. But if it is only cursing and ridicule, or fabricating things, and cannot convince people with reason, it will not achieve the expected effect of improving work. If there is nothing to say, how can you correct it? Therefore, when criticizing, you should strive to make the facts solid and the opinions sharp, so that the improvement of work can truly be helpful. Chen Yuan finally talked about united front work. He said that party members, league members, and members of democratic parties all have organizational relationships, but how should united front work be done for non-partisan people in the future? It is also worth noting. Sometimes, a certain problem is separately conveyed within the party and democratic parties, while non-partisan personages feel that they know very little. Currently, there are still many non-partisan people, and it is likely that this will remain the case in the future. Since we want to mobilize all forces to build socialism, we should not only pay attention to giving play to the strength of democratic parties but also pay attention to strengthening contact with non-partisan people.

Long Yun said that he hoped that the participants in the discussion would have the courage to grasp the key points and speak out boldly.

Long Yun said in his speech that this rectification movement is mainly to oppose sectarianism, bureaucratism, and subjectivism, including dogmatism. He said that he admired the speeches of Mr. Zhang Delin, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Mr. Chen Chutong, Mr. Zhang Boju, and other gentlemen at the discussion meeting. He believed that these speeches were completely about the matter and not the person, truly "speaking without reservation." If every discussion meeting can uphold this spirit, he believed that the Communist Party would definitely get great help in this rectification. He also said that, however, some people's speeches still have reservations, even great reservations. Why is there reservation? He believed that the reason is that the previous few movements made them afraid. He said that this psychology is understandable. However, he believed that this movement is to help the Communist Party rectify its style, which is completely different from the previous movements. First of all, we must trust the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. With this confidence, there is no need to have any reservations. If there are reservations, it means not trusting the Communist Party. Therefore, he hoped that the participants in the discussion would have the courage to grasp the key points and speak out boldly, and less irrelevant and unnecessary words. He believed that the more shortcomings and mistakes are exposed, the fewer shortcomings and mistakes there will be in the future. On the contrary, if the shortcomings and mistakes are covered up, there will still be many shortcomings and mistakes in the future.

Then, Long Yun analyzed the root causes of the mistakes and shortcomings of the Communist Party and put forward his views. He believed that the mistakes and shortcomings pointed out in these few discussion meetings are mostly at the grassroots level, while the root causes are mostly at the top level. He believed that in national administration, there is no division of responsibilities at different levels, but the State Council issues an instruction, which is equivalent to vertical leadership, directly reaching the grassroots level. The party has party instructions, which become dual-track operations. The authority of business departments is not paid attention to, and business departments also have no way to help the grassroots level, and many mistakes and disorders are produced from this. Problems are not considered and studied. He hoped that the State Council would pay more attention to supervision and evaluation in the future. All business, whether specialized or general, should be fully responsible for the person in charge. He also believed that before issuing instructions, the top level often does not fully and deeply consider, thinking that everything is easy. In terms of the country, it is eager to govern and wants to start everything at once, but it does not know that the personnel at the grassroots level lack experience and are not familiar with the business. The matters are complex and heavy, so they cannot adapt to local conditions and cope with them easily. They can only follow the orders and cause disorder. This also produces bureaucratism. He gave an example, saying that in previous years, the education industry was continuously expanding, but this year, the education industry suddenly needs to be compressed, resulting in difficulties for the country, difficulties for the competent departments, and difficulties for society and families. This is rashness and also lightness. Again, for example, last year, it was advocated to wear flowery clothes, but this year, it was advocated to wear patched clothes, making the grassroots level at a loss and not knowing what to do. This propaganda is also a kind of lightness.

He highly approved of the spirit of inspecting and improving at the same time in this rectification movement. He said that in the past, our country's method of selecting students to study abroad was not fair, but recently, many people have criticized it, and yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Higher Education accepted everyone's criticism and immediately improved it, which made people's impression refreshed. He believed that if this spirit can be carried out in the future rectification movement, he believed that the work style of our party and country will definitely be renewed.

He also criticized the problem of cultivating the children of cadres. He said that he heard that Beijing Normal University has an affiliated middle school, which is now changed to the 101st Middle School, and all the students are the children of high-level cadres. Other students are not admitted. This is not fair. For the students, the students trained in such a school will definitely feel superior and have a sense of privilege, which is not good for the students. The capitalist monarchical countries are said to have noble schools and aristocratic schools, and commoners are not admitted. Why does our socialist country also set up such similar noble schools? I think this is also a result of not fully considering.

Finally, he proposed opinions on the problem of ethnic cadres. He said that in ethnic areas, Han cadres do not respect the authority of ethnic cadres and have the phenomenon of taking over and replacing. After ethnic autonomy, the lack of cadres is a fact, so at the beginning, autonomous regions cannot do without Han cadres. This is unavoidable, but now ethnic cadres have been gradually cultivated, and they should be given full opportunities for tempering and improvement, making Han cadres gradually reduce and ethnic cadres gradually increase, and truly take charge of their own affairs, achieving genuine autonomy.

Xu Baojun said that personnel cadres are too serious, and the personnel system is very mysterious, which is a relatively thick wall.

Xu Baojun said in his speech that the general public all feel that personnel cadres are too serious, and they feel very mysterious about the personnel system, making people feel afraid and producing a sense of estrangement. If this is called a wall, it can be said to be a relatively thick wall. How to remove this estrangement is worth paying attention to. He also said that many agency heads, in order to understand the situation and listen to the reports of a part of the people, is completely necessary, but it often raises people's doubts. For example, "Is the report comprehensive and correct?" This makes people suspicious. Here, he cited the example of a young man who was wrongly detained in Nanchang City to say that these things are easy to make people associate with whether someone reported incorrect materials to the leadership at that time, whether there is a problem of retaliation. Therefore, the attitude of the leader in listening to the report is worth studying.

Zhang Yunchuan believed that the wall and ditch are caused by the party members' sense of superiority; active elements are the "volunteer corps" of digging ditches and building walls.

Zhang Yunchuan first talked about his liking to give opinions and criticize because he often starts speaking by pointing out shortcomings. In the past, he was considered backward in thought, anti-party, and was given many hats. Some friends who cared about him advised him to stop talking, and even if he talked, he should not forget the formula: first affirm the achievements and then talk about the shortcomings. He said, is it that I only see shortcomings and do not see advantages? No, it's just that I think the advantages have long existed and are obvious to all, so there is no need for me to say. Pointing out the shortcomings and correcting them can make the achievements more solid, which is good for the party and the country. However, some democratic party comrades only talk about achievements and do not talk about shortcomings, and even praise shortcomings as achievements, which is like seeing a person falling into the mud and not reminding them, which is not good, and this is not loving the Communist Party. Now those who used to think everything was good also point out shortcomings, which proves that they saw shortcomings in the past but did not say, whether they considered personal gains and losses? Whether they were insincere in the past? I think it's better to say the truth than to say lies, although the truth is a bit harsh, and lies are pleasant to hear.

Then, Zhang Yunchuan put forward opinions and criticisms on some of the shortcomings he saw and felt.

Regarding the problem of the wall and ditch, he said that he also agreed with some people's views that there is a wall and ditch between the party and non-party. The reason for the wall and ditch is that some people analyze that party members have a sense of superiority. He said that this sense of superiority was beneficial in the past when fighting against the enemy, but after the revolution's victory, it changed its position in the minds of party members. In the past, during the revolutionary struggle, party members were among the masses leading the revolution, but after the revolution's victory, some party members stood above the masses and were alienated from the masses. Some even felt that they had the privilege of revolution, feeling that others were not revolutionary or not worthy of revolution, and only they were truly revolutionary, the most revolutionary. In daily life, there are often such manifestations. For example, in the office, there are party members and non-party members, but no matter eating or entertainment, party members always sit together, and non-party members sit together. If party members do not first reach out their hands, non-party masses will not easily reach out their hands, fearing that the other side will not shake hands. There may also be such concerns among party members, but the party often educates party members to unite with the masses, so the main responsibility still lies with the party members.

Zhang Yunchuan believed that in work, treatment, and wages, it is shown that Communist Party members are not suffering first and enjoying later, but the opposite, forming privileges, forming walls. In this situation, although it is emphasized that non-party personnel should establish a sense of ownership, it is still natural to have a sense of being a guest and an employed thought.

He said that in addition to these party members who should bear the main responsibility for the wall and ditch, there are also some "volunteer corps" who dig ditches and build walls, which have played a great role. Who are the volunteer corps? He believed that they are active elements. He said that after liberation, all kinds of people gathered around the Communist Party like a storm, and the party has the responsibility to understand everyone. If they can widely solicit opinions and mutually quote, it may be better. But this is not done, only a few people are believed, and they are called active elements and relied on to speak nonsense, and then the queue of who is progressive and who is backward is sorted out, making the party and the masses separated. These people then use the party's prestige to intimidate people, and unconsciously, a wall is built and a ditch is dug between the party and the masses. In fact, these people who have not been transformed or are being transformed should be despised, but the party trusts and encourages them, saying that they are active, progressive, and close to the party. Thus, this group of people struts around in the masses, acting arrogantly, and not only do the masses fear them a little, but even the heads of democratic parties also fear what they say and accommodate them. Seeing a play because of the makeup, it is easy to distinguish, but some people's style is not upright, and they invert right and wrong, and they do not wear makeup, so it is not easy to distinguish. This situation is better now, but it still exists, and it is suggested that the United Front Work Department pay attention to it.

The second issue, Zhang Yunchuan talked about the problem of cadres serving the people. He said that since liberation, it has been emphasized that cadres should serve the people, but some people do not seem to feel that they are serving the people, the people's servants, but in their minds, they think they are officials. "Official" is a person who stands above the masses. We have more than a million cadres, if they are all officials standing above the masses, how can the masses bear it. I used to see "Night Unending," which left a deep impression on me, similar to "True and False Inspector." Officials are layered, no matter big officials or small officials, all stand above the masses. I have a kind of anarchist thought, I think our cadres can only have job differences, but should not have high and low, noble and humble differences because of job differences. Now, with the mentality of an official, the situation of big officials not wanting to talk to small officials is universal. If this is not corrected, the consequences will be bad. Why in performances, meals, and other occasions, there must be strict official ranks and official airs? It is worth considering. The higher up, the more difficult it is to make the lower not imitate. Because of the strict official ranks, official airs, and life differences, it is natural to make people quarrel over positions.

Zhang Yunchuan said that he thought that in united front work, the fame and status of the old society should be distinguished.

The third is the united front issue. Zhang Yunchuan said that he likes to watch "Water Margin," but he does not understand some of the actions of Liangshan Marsh. For example, Yu Qide Lu Junyi originally had no much relationship with Liangshan Marsh, but he does not know why Song Jiang valued him so much and insisted on pulling him up the mountain to sit in the second seat, is this united front work? While Hei Xuanfeng Li Kui and even Cai Guorong Cai Jin were not valued. He thought that in united front work, the fame and status of the old society should also be distinguished. Some people indeed have real talents and learning; some people are good at climbing the dragon, which is not glorious; some people's fame and status are obtained by blowing and flattering, should their political status be considered? He thought that united front work, if a person is correctly united, will have a good effect, if a person is wrongly united, will still have a side effect.

Zhang Yunchuan quoted the evaluation of the story of Si Ma Xiangru and Zhao Jun after saying: Today, many things are like this: someone does it right, and someone does it wrong.

Title: Discussions on the Rectification Movement and United Front Work

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th.

	Zhang Yunchuan suggested that the roles of various democratic parties in different historical periods should be evaluated, rather than focusing solely on the history of the Communist Party. In addition to the above criticisms, Zhang Yunchuan also suggested that in the history of the Chinese revolution, the roles of democratic parties in various historical periods should also be given due evaluation, not just the history of the Communist Party. Although the Communist Party is the mainstream of the revolution, democratic parties are also tributaries and minor streams, playing a certain role.

	Regarding the work of the personnel department, Zhang Yunchuan also made two suggestions: First, it would be better to have some older cadres with more social experience do personnel work, because young people do not understand the situation of the old society and may cut off history when reviewing others' backgrounds, unable to make a comprehensive judgment. Second, whether the personnel department can open another channel. Currently, some people in society directly petition the government to solve employment problems. These people rarely have the opportunity to reflect on the situation, and even if they do, it is not taken seriously. The personnel department should consider this.

	Finally, Zhang Yunchuan suggested that the achievements and side effects of the ideological reform and rectification work on high-level intellectuals should be reviewed, compared, and summarized.

	Zhu Yunshan said: Demolishing walls and filling ditches is not about the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The issue is to strengthen leadership, not weaken it.

	During my inspection in Nanjing, I encountered provincial and municipal party officials who were conducting a rectification movement, asking various democratic parties to help with the rectification. Currently, offices, schools, and enterprises are all actively speaking out, and many opinions have been raised. At the Nanjing meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I heard Chen Jiazheng, a section chief of the Finance Bureau, say that the party committee of provincial and municipal organs generally pays little attention to united front education. For example, the director of the Construction Engineering Department, Zhang, mentioned democratic parties three times in a cadre meeting, referring to the China Democratic National Construction Association as the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and was given feedback. He still referred to the China Democratic National Construction Association as the Chinese Revolutionary Party in the second meeting. Generally, party members and youth league members always mention democratic personages alongside the elderly, weak, and disabled. Chen also said that the party committee promotes cadres who are mostly party members and youth league members. A leading cadre who was found to be corrupt was asked to make a self-criticism at a party small group meeting, and that was it. When the masses had opinions, he replied that he was afraid of losing authority and that work would be difficult to do afterward. Wang Liangjun, deputy director of the Jiangsu Postal Management Bureau, said that members of the China Democratic National Construction Association are hesitant to speak out. He said that Jiangsu has more than seventy postal bureaus, with 85% of the directors being young party members who do not understand the business, and not even one non-party vice-director who understands the business.

	The united front education in local areas is uneven, with some places not paying attention and others paying a lot of attention. For example, Suzhou is an ancient city where party members and non-party members get along very well because the united front department is very enthusiastic in helping. Many elderly intellectuals and people with classical literary and artistic accomplishments regard the Political Consultative Conference as a home for the elderly. They are close to the party, and their learning is also very enthusiastic. This shows that as long as any place or unit can implement the party's united front education, democratic parties will not be disregarded, and the work of unity will be done well.

	Why did the Party Central Committee launch the rectification movement? I think the Chinese Communist Party has made many mistakes in the past. The Zunyi Conference, led by Chairman Mao, turned things around. By 1942, the rectification movement unified the party's ideological understanding, corrected bad practices, and made more friends. From then on, the working class grew stronger, leading the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establishing the People's Republic. In the past eight years, the party has carried out a series of socialist transformations and has completed the transition from the new democratic revolution to the new stage of socialism. Today, the ruling party has become the highest leadership core of a country with six hundred million people. The party's prestige has reached its peak. If some party members cannot execute the party's policies or if their thinking is rigid, remaining in the stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the past eight years of socialist transformation, they will not be able to adapt to the new political tasks. Rusty iron cannot be used without being re-forged. Therefore, a rectification movement must be launched. This rectification movement is a great, timely, and wise measure. Its purpose is to take out the sacred weapon of Marxism-Leninism to handle people's internal contradictions and march towards socialism. Through this movement, the expected result will definitely be very healthy. It will unite six hundred million people, except for a few counter-revolutionaries, around the party, moving from socialism directly to the path of communism. This is beyond doubt.

	Why should democratic parties help with the rectification? I feel that various democratic parties have gone through hardships with the Communist Party, either earlier or later, all have their historical factors, and long-term coexistence is not accidental. Our help in the party's rectification is also helping ourselves. We have gone through a tortuous and winding road, and either earlier or later, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have all joined the new democratic revolution. Now we are further advancing to the new historical stage of socialism. On the one hand, we help the party's rectification, and on the other hand, we combine our own ideological reform work. In this great movement of gentle rain, we learn Marxism-Leninism to handle people's internal contradictions, the sacred weapon. We learn while helping, and our thinking can be improved. Our work in all aspects can also be promoted and improved. As for the issue of walls and ditches between the party and non-party, I once said in Nanjing that I always feel that walls and ditches are built by both sides. I think the requirements for party members should be higher, and their responsibilities should be greater. Some walls and ditches are man-made, and some may be caused by work systems. In any case, everyone needs to work together, speak out more, and dare to speak out. Problems should be laid out together. Even if there are strong fortresses, they can be demolished while being rectified. When demolishing walls and filling ditches, everyone's views and expressions may be different, but that's okay. The purpose is only one: to improve work and promote socialist construction. Some offices, schools, and enterprise departments have many walls and ditches. Should the party committee be withdrawn from offices, schools, and enterprises, and public representatives be withdrawn from enterprise departments? That would be demolishing walls and filling ditches. I think demolishing walls and filling ditches is not about the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The issue is to strengthen leadership, not weaken it. The socialist cause cannot be successful without the Communist Party as the leadership core. Someone proposed that the party should replace the government or the party should replace the school. There are some problems worth studying in the work system. I personally think that no matter how the system is studied, it is only from adjusting relationships and improving leadership methods that we should focus. The party is the leadership core of socialist construction. This rectification movement is precisely to strengthen this leadership core and promote our great socialist cause to advance. I have a few suggestions for the United Front Work Department to consider:

	(1) The rectification movement has achievements. In the past, the mass line was used to rectify, which was correct. It is also undeniable to follow the policy of rectifying errors and correcting mistakes. The problem is that in the implementation of the work, some parts have expanded the scope of rectification. I suggest that after the National People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Conference should immediately hold a joint meeting based on Chairman Mao's instructions at the highest state council meeting, quickly organize a temporary inspection agency, and work with relevant departments to go to various places to seriously inspect the so-called rectification legacy issues. In my opinion, there are not more than four situations: (1) Those who were completely wrong should be completely rectified, and apologies should be made. If someone was announced as guilty in a mass meeting, they should also be announced as not guilty in a similar mass meeting to comfort those who were wrongly struggled against. (2) Those who were not wrong but handled improperly should be corrected according to the rectification policy. (3) Those who only have suspicions but no concrete evidence, or those who only have unclear histories and cause doubts, should be concluded early and not drag on. (4) Those who were not wrong but were given lenient treatment should be told clearly that they should not shout "rectification" or overturn cases. In the process of correcting errors, the rectification movement, including Communist Party members, should also be inspected. I think we should not pour cold water on the cadres who led the rectification.

	(2) Some party committees do not pay enough attention to democratic parties. I suggest that the Party Central Committee issue a decision to clearly instruct central and local party committees at all levels to seriously and responsibly hold regular party meetings, strengthen leadership, and ensure the implementation of the united front education policy, and help various democratic parties do their work well.

	(3) The salary standards and welfare of democratic party cadres are lower than those of government agencies, and promotion is also more difficult. Taking the China Democratic National Construction Association as an example, there is no first-level setting in the system, and the organizations below the department are only equivalent to the section level of government agencies. This greatly restricts their promotion and promotion. Generally, democratic party cadres are also somewhat disregarded, so many cadres easily become discontented with democratic party work and have moods. This is no wonder. I suggest that the Political Consultative Conference and the United Front Work Department help various democratic parties jointly discuss and formulate democratic party management methods in comparison with the national agency personnel system.

	Additionally, the China Democratic National Construction Association has helped many social figures and unemployed members in various places with employment and arrangements, which we are very grateful for. Recently, some places have reflected that through organizational queues, they have solved many problems, but some have been solved through private channels first, causing imbalances and putting local responsible persons in a passive position. They hope that in the future, more connections will be made.

	Liu Fei said: The party should not replace the government, just as the operator of a machine cannot replace the machine.

	Liu Fei said in his speech that in the party-government relationship, there are some who are divided at the top but not at the bottom, divided early but not late, divided here but not there. Especially at the county level and below, only the party is seen, and the government is not seen. The people's congresses at the lower levels are also held very abnormally. The main reason for the emergence of this situation is that soon after the founding of the country, the legal system is not yet perfect, and some high-level cadres and many middle and lower-level cadres have weak legal awareness, as well as a lack of democratic style, which has an impact. The Party Central Committee's attention to this aspect is also not enough. To change these situations, in addition to carrying out ideological rectification, it is also necessary to strengthen legal awareness education among general party cadres, quickly formulate necessary laws, and improve various necessary systems, especially the personnel system, to clarify the party-government relationship. Moreover, party members should set an example and respect the authority of state agencies. Otherwise, although rectification can have a short-term effect, it lacks a constant legal guarantee.

	He said that the party and the government are two systems with different natures. The party is the core of leading national affairs, but the party's leadership must be realized through the state machine. The party should not replace the government, just as the operator of a machine cannot replace the machine. However, some party members do not understand this relationship and want to control everything, even ranking and salary evaluations must be higher than others. They think that this is how the party's leadership is realized and the party's prestige is enhanced. This is a way to make the state agencies rusty and will also breed the "three evils" and deepen people's internal contradictions.

	Liu Fei also mentioned in his speech that many problems in grassroots organizations are related to the fact that our cause is developing too fast and the tasks are too heavy. He said that leading agencies often pile up many tasks and policies on the grassroots, which they cannot digest or accept, and problems are bound to arise.

	Liu Fei also mentioned some problems and opinions on the party's work in uniting, transforming, and using intellectuals.

	He said that in the past, some places did not properly implement the policy on intellectuals, causing some people to suffer grievances, and the work of unity was not done well afterwards. They have opinions. To change this situation, on the one hand, mistakes must be corrected, and the grievances of those who suffered must be restored. On the other hand, party members must be educated to change their hard attitude towards intellectuals. These people will then eliminate their prejudices and understand the inevitability of past errors.

	Chen Shaokuan said: Party members outside Fujian Province actively expose contradictions and help the party with rectification.

	Chen Shaokuan said that he was summoned to Beijing to participate in the national budget meeting, and the United Front Work Department also gave him this opportunity to participate in the symposium. I feel very honored.

	I am from Fujian. Please let me talk about the relevant situation in Fujian. Fujian, like other places in the country, is also studying Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling people's internal contradictions to prepare for the ongoing rectification movement. The provincial United Front Work Department has also held several symposiums to discuss internal contradictions and help with rectification. The fourth session of the provincial people's congress was held just a few days ago, and this session further promoted democracy. People's representatives and attendees actively exposed contradictions, analyzed contradictions, solved contradictions, and helped the party promote the rectification movement, and also proposed opinions to promote national socialist construction. In Fujian, party members and non-party members get along very well in their daily interactions. The provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee leaders are modest in their attitudes and often consider the democratic parties. Through the Political Consultative Conference, united front work is done well. The chairman of the provincial Political Consultative Conference is the provincial party committee secretary, the vice-chairman of the standing committee is the director of the United Front Work Department, and the secretary-general is a deputy director of the United Front Work Department. The leaders of democratic parties are also vice-chairmen of the provincial Political Consultative Conference. They meet every week to work and participate in collective work meetings. This shows that party members and non-party members often meet and discuss matters. The leaders of democratic parties can often meet with the leaders of the United Front Work Department and discuss matters, so there is no estrangement. In addition, party members are also very close to intellectuals and democratic personages. Because the provincial Political Consultative Conference has collective work every Saturday afternoon, followed by organized education, cultural, health, and business discussions, after which they have dinner and entertainment. Chinese people feel intimate after three cups of yellow wine, and they can talk about their inner difficulties. The party and the government can immediately solve those that can be solved, and those that are more difficult are also studied and solved. This not only eliminates estrangement but also solves difficulties, making the party, government, and the masses communicate. Usually, when there is a problem, it is spoken out, and speaking out and criticizing are done habitually. Party members have no contradictions or estrangement with me, and they also value and trust me. Many important matters are first discussed with me, and I am also closely cared for and considered. Many meetings that do not need to be attended by non-party members, sometimes I am also invited to attend. In daily interactions, we are very intimate, like a family, with no formality. I also do not feel alienated. When I was seriously ill at the beginning of the year, the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee leaders and responsible comrades were even more closely concerned about me. They held several meetings of famous doctors to discuss treatment, specially invited famous experts from Shanghai to Fujian, and the health minister personally guided and helped with the treatment, allowing me to recover. This made me feel the noble qualities and morals of Communist Party members, and I am very grateful. This matter is known to all democratic party members in the province and has greatly moved social figures. Party members are also very close and friendly to other democratic party members in their daily interactions, especially the provincial United Front Work Department, which has helped democratic parties a lot, solved difficulties, and solved problems. In the provincial people's congress and the provincial Political Consultative Conference, democracy is also promoted, and matters are discussed and considered. The united front work in Fujian is really well done.

	Xu Chubo said: Various aspects criticize primary and secondary school teachers more and encourage them less.

	Xu Chubo said in his speech that various aspects criticize primary and secondary school teachers more and encourage them less, causing the teachers' morale to be low and their confidence to be insufficient. He said this is because the importance of primary and secondary school teachers is not fully appreciated and not valued enough. He mentioned that in Beijing, some schools ask teachers to apologize to students, and the "72 very powerful points" published in the China Youth Daily have also affected the teachers' morale. "People's Education" and "Teacher's Report" do not understand the teachers' pain and often criticize teachers, so many teachers do not want to read "Teacher's Report". He also mentioned that teachers are used a lot but cared for little. For example, in some places, physical education teachers have many tasks on weekdays and cannot rest on Sundays, but when there are sports events like ball games, buying tickets is difficult, and relevant departments do not give any consideration. He mentioned that party and state leaders and representatives from all walks of life have been received, but primary and secondary school teachers have not been received. In terms of welfare and treatment, teachers are also relatively low. He said that in Sichuan, some places have very poor teachers' dormitories, while the workers' dormitories of nearby factories are high-rise buildings, truly a world of difference. The salary of primary school teachers is also not as high as that of workers, so teachers want to go to factories to work but do not want to stay in schools. He said that salary treatment, political treatment, plus the general public's lack of respect for primary and secondary school teachers, makes many primary and secondary students not want to study education.

	He also mentioned that the united front work in schools is not balanced. In some schools, party members and non-party members get along well, while in some schools, party members have cliquism. He said that in places with cliquism, party secretaries and party branch secretaries are mostly young people who do not understand the business well and do not get along well with old teachers. They think old teachers are backward, and old teachers think they do not understand the business, and they look down on each other. When upper-level cadres promote cadres, they often emphasize virtue over talent, and party members and youth league members are enough. After promotion, they are sent to various schools to serve as principals, directors of education, etc. These young people do not humbly get along with old teachers and learn from them. While the education administrative department understands the work situation, it only listens to their reports. He said that when he inspected Sichuan, the local education bureau introduced him to a school to inspect, which was considered a school with good party-non-party relations. However, the actual situation was not like that. Teachers raised many serious opinions, even some that are rarely seen in general schools. He also mentioned that in Beijing, there is a school where the principal and the party branch secretary have cliquism, causing old teachers to be dissatisfied. The education bureau went to investigate and understood the situation from the party branch and the personnel department, but the problem was not solved. Teachers wrote to him, and he forwarded the letter to the education bureau, but there has been no response for more than a year. Wu Yanren believes that the title "Zhou Jianren agrees that 'demolishing walls' should be done from both sides" in this newspaper is "suggesting that non-party members should not speak out."

	Wu Yanren said in his speech: We did not attend the ninth (June 22nd) symposium, but I still paid attention to the symposium's speeches. I first noticed the People's Daily's record. On June 23rd, the People's Daily's record of the symposium used a large, bold title to highlight "the discussion gradually deepens." So, I carefully looked at everyone's speeches to see how deep they were. Later, I saw the small title in bold type, "Zhou Jianren agrees that 'demolishing walls' should be done from both sides," and I suddenly realized that the People's Daily's so-called deepening is an appreciation of Zhou Jianren's speech, which emphasizes agreeing that democratic parties should also demolish walls, which is to undergo ideological reform. We have never denied ideological reform. Helping the party with rectification is also a learning process, which is also ideological reform. However, in the current stage, we should only emphasize party rectification, demolishing walls, and demolishing the walls of the "three evils." Because in the current stage, the walls of the "three evils" are just starting to be demolished, and they are far from being demolished to the lower levels. For example, the primary and secondary school teacher members of the China Democratic League are eagerly looking forward to having the opportunity to help demolish walls when demolishing walls at the lower levels. As a leader of the China Democratic League, not representing primary and secondary school teachers to speak, but emphasizing the need for ideological reform, seems to want to sing a counterpoint when the party is demolishing walls, which is to demolish walls by oneself and not help the party demolish walls, with a strong intention of passive resistance. Chairman Mao, in the highest state council meeting on April 30th, gave instructions on the rectification movement, saying that now the party is rectifying, and democratic parties should help the party rectify, and not that democratic parties should rectify. He also said that theoretical learning can be stopped, otherwise it will dilute the rectification movement. I think Zhou Jianren's words, at least, will dilute the rectification movement. Therefore, I disagree, and many comrades in the China Democratic League also disagree.

	I am not satisfied with Zhou Jianren's speech, but I do not want to speak out to refute it, because Zhou Jianren has his own freedom of speech, and we disagree with it, but we do not need to refute it. However, the People's Daily actually appreciates Zhou Jianren's speech, considering it deepening, which makes me wonder what the People's Daily's intention is. Is it afraid that others will help the party demolish walls, demolishing too much, suggesting that non-party members should not speak out, and should go back to their rooms to reflect on their thoughts, demolishing the walls of their thoughts. In other words, "go away, you should go back to your room to reflect on your thoughts, and do not come to interfere."

	Because the People's Daily's attitude is like this, I wrote a short article and gave it to the Light Daily reporter to pass on to the People's Daily. The meaning of that article, although it was written in response to Zhou Jianren's speech, was actually aimed at the People's Daily. I have opinions about the People's Daily. That article was written on June 24th and sent on June 25th, but it has not been published yet. This may be because the People's Daily has too many manuscripts, or it may be because it does not agree with the People's Daily's meaning. In any case, I do not understand what the People's Daily means by deepening, is it what I understand?

	Finally, I declare: That article sent to the People's Daily is not necessarily to be published by the People's Daily. At that time, I thought the United Front Work Department would not hold a meeting anymore, so I wrote a written opinion. If I had known that the United Front Work Department would still hold a meeting today, I might have spoken out in the meeting and would not have written that article.

	Liu Wenhui raised the issue of protecting citizens' rights.

	Liu Wenhui talked about the issue of protecting citizens' rights. He said that in the past, cadres at all levels generally could not well distinguish between enemy contradictions and people's internal contradictions. From the facts revealed in the recent rectification, it can be seen that bureaucratism, cliquism, and subjectivism are quite common throughout the country. These cannot but infringe on citizens' rights. Because the grassroots cadres need too many people, the general cultural and political levels of middle and lower-level cadres are not as high as those of upper-level cadres, and it is easy to treat people's internal contradictions as enemy contradictions. If some people are arrogant and satisfied with themselves, and their style is rude, to the extent of violating laws and regulations, then the infringement on citizens' rights will be even more serious. He said that this issue has been noticed by the party and the state for a long time, so in the Constitution, Article 97 clearly stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to make written or oral complaints to various levels of state agencies about any state agency work that violates laws and regulations. Citizens who suffer losses due to the infringement of their rights by state agency workers have the right to compensation." This article provides effective guarantees for citizens' rights and can also be said to grant citizens a right to protect their rights. However, ordinary citizens are under the coercive orders of some grassroots cadres, can they effectively exercise the right of complaint granted by the Constitution? Do state agencies compensate for the losses suffered by citizens due to the infringement of their rights by cadres? He thinks there are still problems. Especially for the compensation for the infringement of citizens' rights, many agencies do not pay enough attention.

	He said that in history, the ruling class's government was extremely cruel in exploiting and oppressing the people, and it was impossible to talk about protecting citizens' rights. But their power was fragile, and their strength was scattered, and their orders were not always implemented. Good times were rare, and the government's orders could not even leave the door. In addition, the organization of society was not strict, so many people could think of various ways to avoid it in times of emergency. He said that today, not only is the people's government different in nature from the old government, but the country has also achieved unprecedented unity, and the people's power shows unprecedented strength. The government's orders are always fully implemented, and the leadership's decisions are always thoroughly executed, which is unparalleled in any era. Only in this way can the realization of a happy socialist society and a perfect communist society be guaranteed, which is the greatest advantage of our political system. He said that, however, Chairman Mao teaches us to look at problems from two sides. In this situation, if the cadres who implement state policies, to say nothing of violating laws and regulations, to say nothing of treating people's internal contradictions as enemy contradictions, just because they do not fully understand the spirit of the policy and make relatively large deviations, the masses will not be able to bear it; and because the organization of society is very strict, there is no possibility of avoiding it today. What should the masses do at this time? They can only exercise their right of complaint according to law. As for exercising the right of complaint, I am afraid that some masses still do not know about it, even if they know, they are not without concerns. They are concerned that if they complain and lose, what should they do? They are concerned that if they complain and win, the other party will only make a self-criticism, and in the future, they will find an opportunity to take revenge, what should they do? To complain is difficult and has concerns, and it is even more difficult to talk about exercising the right of compensation for damages. He said that there is an old saying in our country: "Fear not the officials, but fear the managers." Grassroots cadres often come into contact with the masses, and they directly control the interests and misfortunes of the whole family of the masses. Therefore, the masses have many concerns, so they cannot actively exercise the right of complaint and the right of compensation for damages granted by the Constitution, which is not difficult to understand. In this way, people's internal contradictions may be deepened.

	He believes that the party must pay full attention to this aspect in the future. He also made three suggestions: (1) Strengthen the political and ideological education of grassroots cadres, and carry out the rectification movement to the grassroots, solving problems from the ideological level, which is the fundamental way. (2) Strictly implement the provisions of Article 97 of the Constitution, ensuring that citizens can fully exercise their right of complaint and the right of compensation for damages. In the past, when a cadre infringed on the people's rights, it was often just a matter of making a self-criticism, but in the future, if the responsibility of compensation for damages is added, the educational significance for cadres will be much greater. (3) Strengthen the supervisory role of people's representatives and state supervisory agencies. The ancients said: "Laws alone cannot be enforced." The Constitution has been promulgated for three years, but citizens' right of complaint and the right of compensation for damages have not been fully exercised, and the lack of effective supervision is also an important reason. People's representatives have the obligation to protect the rights of voters, and state supervisory agencies have the responsibility to implement revolutionary legal systems. The party and the government should strengthen their responsibilities and make them effectively play a supervisory role in protecting people's rights. He believes that if various aspects can think of ways to protect citizens' rights, it will greatly help in solving the problem of people's internal contradictions.

	Li Junlong, based on his inspection of Northeast and other regions, raised issues in the united front work of colleges and universities and factories and enterprises.

	Li Junlong, in his speech, based on his inspection of sixteen colleges and universities, two scientific research institutions, and several factories and enterprises in the Northeast and other regions, raised issues in the united front work of colleges and universities and factories and enterprises. He discussed this issue from seven aspects:

	1. Strengthen the united front work in factories, enterprises, and colleges and universities. He said that in Fularki, a district head also serves as the head of the United Front Work Department, and many engineering and technical personnel rarely see him. Fularki is a new industrial area with heavy tasks of urban construction and supply, and it is obvious that the district head serving as the head of the United Front Work Department can only manage one thing and neglect the other. He said that the political and ideological education work in many colleges and universities is not done well. However, the masses have urgent needs in this regard. Therefore, he hopes that in the future, more reports on current affairs and politics will be made to the masses, especially academic reports, and not limited to party members, but should try to give full play to the role of democratic party members. The party committee should better use the strength of democratic party organizations in the future.

	2. The political and ideological work in some new industrial cities is poor, and non-party technical personnel are not paid enough attention.

	3. The work of the trade union is weak and done very poorly. He said that the trade union of the Northeast Friendship Farm only collects dues and does not do other work, and there is no one to manage cultural and entertainment activities.

	4. The evaluation of ranks and salaries has solved many unfair phenomena, but it has also brought many new problems. He said that in the past, some places emphasized virtue more in the evaluation of ranks, and did not pay enough attention to business and seniority. Some old professors' salaries are not as high as those of university graduates who graduated not long ago. One of the reasons is that some young people doing personnel work are very hardworking, but they know little about the old society and have inappropriate views on old intellectuals and old personnel. He thinks that personnel work can be done by non-party members.

	5. The hierarchy in schools is too strict. He said that in Northeast Normal University, some professors have to register two days in advance to see the principal. When holding evening parties, they first have the directors (including section chiefs) and then the professors, which makes the professors dissatisfied. He thinks this situation should be changed.

	6. New party members and new youth league members should be given united front education, education on the old society, and education on revolutionary traditions. He said that many new party members know little about the old society and know little about the hardships of the revolution. With the prestige of the party and Chairman Mao, they use it as a capital for arrogance. He also thinks that now the Communist Party has 12 million members, and in the future, there is no need to accept intellectuals into the party so quickly. Some new party members, after joining the party, feel that they are party members, and their attitude towards old professors changes.

	7. He suggested that the party committee of colleges and universities consider being led by the provincial party committee, rather than the municipal party committee. At the same time, he hopes that in the future, the provincial party committee secretary, deputy secretary, and minister of education will pay more attention to schools and inspect more united front work, so that the relationship between the party and non-party may be better. (Note: The speeches of Luo Ziyu at the symposium and the written speeches of Chen Qiyu and Mao Yisheng will be continued to be published tomorrow.)

    中央统战部继续邀民主人士座谈
    十六个人发言对各方面工作提出意见
    本报讯　中共中央统一战线工作部邀请各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会，在休会七天后，于昨日继续举行。上午在会上发言的有：中国民主促进会秘书长杨东莼，中国国民党革命委员会常务委员宁武，无党派民主人士陈垣，中国农工民主党中央执行局委员张云川，中国国民党革命委员会副主席龙云、常务委员朱蕴山。下午在会上发言的有：民革中央常务委员刘文辉、刘斐，中国民主促进会常务委员吴研因，民革中央副主席陈绍宽，民革中央常务委员许宝驹，中国民主促进会中央常务委员徐楚波，民革中央常务委员李俊龙，民盟中央副秘书长罗子为；中国致公党主席陈其尤，九三学社中央常务委员茅以升也在昨天的会上作了书面发言。
    杨东莼认为：许多地方统战工作作得不好的原因之一是不懂得这个政策，希望总结中央统战部继续邀民主人士座谈十六个人发言对各方面工作提出意见三十多年统战工作的历史，建议党内进行一次系统的统战政策教育
      杨东莼在发言中，对如何贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出了意见。他说：民主党派要得到社会重视和党内重视，毫无问题，应该自己从工作中争取，但是，另一方面，必须做好统战政策的宣传教育工作，从思想上解除障碍，使大家了解民主党派在国家事务中的作用，才能更好地贯彻这个方针。杨东莼认为：许多地方统战工作所以做得不好，原因虽多，但有一个原因就是不懂得统战政策，如农工民主党的对象是什么？好多人就说是医药卫生工作者，民主促进会的对象是什么？好多人也说是中、小学教员，有人甚至以为九三学社是公私合营的什么企业。再比如：民主党派在有些单位发展组织时，竟然遭到拒绝，说：“我们这里已有一个民主党派了”。因此，杨东莼认为：要贯彻这一方针，思想教育实属重要。如何进行统战教育呢？杨东莼提了四点意见：
    第一，他说：总结一下三十多年的统战工作经验，其中包括知识分子改造问题和私营工商业改造的经验，这是根本之图。胡乔木同志在“中国共产党的三十年”一书
  中，说到了统战工作是革命的三大法宝之一，这本书发行到现在已经六年多了，六年中变化很大，应该进一步总结和分析。这个总结分析是科学研究，而且是马列主义的科学研究，其中有理论、有事实、有历史，还有艺术。要总结得好，必须党和民主党派、无党派民主人士通力合作，从各个历史时期的发展上，来说明统战工作的必要性，民主党派在各个历史时期的发展和作用，以及今后的任务等等。有人说我们是吃团结饭的，吃团结饭不坏，
    难道要叫我们吃分裂饭？现在有人把历史割断了，孤立起来看现在，我看这三十多年来统战工作的历史还是不能割断的。有了这个总结，贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，思想上的阻力就会减少一些。
      第二个问题，杨东莼说：中学我不谈，几年来大学的政治课，起了一定作用，但无庸讳言，也有很大缺点，这就是干巴巴的教条主义和现实的政治、经济生活毫不相干，而且写好讲稿，逐字逐句念，下面逐字逐句记，对现实生活很少谈到。如宪法是我们国家的根本大法，但是如果给大学生考考人民代表大会和政治协商会议有什么区别，我想，及格的人恐怕不会太多。对统一战线政策当然更不知道了。现在高教部正在重新草拟政治课程教学大纲，是否可以考虑一下，把政治课同现实的政治生活和经济生活联系起来，并把统一战线政策放在一定的地位。我想这样做，对团结知识分子会有好处，对贯彻长期共存，互相监督的方针也会有好处。
    第三个问题，杨东莼谈到民主党派有无论坛的问题。他说：有，光明日报就是，另外人民日报、大公报、文汇报都登了许多有关民主党派的文章，现在什么都登也无人审查，这很好，但是还应该加强。如何加强呢？我觉得：光明日报在当前大放大鸣的时候，应该出六版，不应出四版，以便在整风期间，让大家在论坛上活跃些。杨东莼还建议各机关、学校可设民主党派讲坛，让民主党派有机会讲话，尤其在进行统战政策教育的时候更有必要。如某学校一个同志对统战政策统错了，事情不大，不需要拿到报纸上去，就可以在那个学校里公开说清楚，讲清楚了，也就是进行了统战政策教育。当然，我并不主张资产阶级的民主，今天群众水平提高了，可以明辨是非，有人要想哗众取宠，既不能哗众，也不能取宠。这个对台戏怎样唱呢？杨东莼举了一个很生动的例子，他说：这个对台戏是吴铁庵和谭鑫培那样的对台戏，吴就是学谭，同样是谭派，谭唱什么戏，吴也唱什么戏，我们今天虽然有个论坛，则是学习马克思列宁主义，以马克思列宁主义为指导思想。这跟资产阶级的在野党同执政党的唱对戏是完全不同的。也许讲坛上讲错了，但是，不要紧，讲错了，可以辩论，经过辩论，是非就出来了，这样民主生活就可以更活跃起来。
  第四个问题，杨东莼建议在党内首先进行一次有系统的统战政策教育，他认为这个工作如果做得好，对于贯彻“长期共存，互相监督”的方针会大有好处。
    最后，为了贯彻这个方针，杨东莼还提出三个具体意见：第一、他说：统战部要求我们反映所联系的社会人士的意见，但是，反映以后很少有下文，他希望反映上去的问题能解决的一定要解决，不能解决的，也该有个下文。第二、他建议从中央到地方直到各个单位，党与民主党派的关系要建立一系列的制度，如会议或座谈会、人事等等，都需要有个制度。第三、下面民主党派的干部对政治待遇很有意见，如参考消息，究竟什么人才能看呢？如某一地方规定十六级的才可以看，而十八级的秘书长反而不能看，这样做，是否合理，值得考虑。
    宁武说：民主人士要作共产党的“诤友”
    宁武发言中认为，既然是帮助党整风，对于个别有错误的党员，就应该以“诤友”的态度进行批评，而不应该对他们维护。他说，只有这样，才符合党的期望。
    他说，一切犯了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义错误的党员，都是党性不纯的表现。有些党员的个性完全超过了它的党性。因此，他建议党中央要加强对党员的党性教育。
    他说，据我的观察，凡是1949年以前入党的党员，党性就比较强。而1949年以后的党员，党性就比较差。他认为，现在全国党员有一千二百多万，其中党员的修养和锻炼大有差别。过去的党员参加革命，冒着生命的危险，而全国解放以后的党员则不是这样，他们是愉快而光荣的参加党，只是抱着荣誉感，他们经过的艰苦锻炼比较少，因此，必须对他们加强教育和改造。他还对王明在中共第八次代表大会上当选为中央委员表示很大的诧异。他说，王明过去犯过十分严重的错误，但是，据他知道并未作过什么检讨，他认为这是个性超过党性的典型。
    他还谈到在对待知识分子工作中的宗派主义问题。他说，目前歧视知识分子，特别是年岁较大的知识分子，是一种相当普遍的现象。在大专学校中，就尤其严重。有些党员干部，对年老的知识分子，有一种一成不变的看法，认为他们来自旧社会，历史不干净，思想有问题，于是摆在那里，既不帮助提高，又不给适当的工作。据我知道，那些年纪从五十岁到七十岁的旧知识分子，只要党和国家了解和关怀他们，绝大多数人的情绪是很高的，知道自己是从旧社会来，带来了不少的旧思想、旧作风，愿意改造自己，愿意在晚年献出自己的所长。当他们不能如愿，而感到自己是在“尸位素餐”时，心情十分苦恼。这也是一种矛盾：一方面，建设社会主义需要人材，感到人材缺乏；另一方面，又有些人不能充分发挥他们的才能。这种矛盾主要是由宗派主义造成的。因此，他希望通过这次整风运动一定要解决这个问题。
    陈垣提出：今后使用干部必须放手放心，才能调动他们的积极性
    陈垣首先谈到教育部的领导问题，他说：我们北京师范大学，是高等学校，又与普通教育有关，我们由教育部直接领导，又与高教部有关，但由于教育部和高教部工作上联系不够，很多事情是高教部布置给高等学校的，有时就没我们的份，造成很不好的影响，好像我们又是大学，又不是大学。有的教授说：我们是中学头，大学尾，在夹缝里讨生活。因此，教育部与高教部必须很好的配合，注意到师大的特殊性质。陈垣还说：关于课程的设置、比重，有的不很恰当。教育部有时过分相信教育理论的教条，从实际考虑得不够。
    关于宗派主义问题，陈垣认为：党必须特别加以注意。他认为共产党所以有宗派主义，是因为过去对敌斗争情况随时提高警惕，已逐渐成为习惯，建国以后，对全国干部情况还心中无数，自然要多依靠政治上可靠的人，那是完全必要的。但是，目前主要矛盾是人民内部的矛盾，如果再有宗派主义就会大大影响党外群众的积极性，等于逐渐放弃各种积极力量，群众会由积极而消极而袖手旁观了。陈垣认为：在目前情况下，在使用干部上必须放手放心，才能使袖手旁观的人，卷起袖子来积极参加建设。
    对于老教师的信任问题，陈垣说：由于过去使很多人感到有不信任的倾向，今后要多在这方面作工作。旧知识分子都有一些高傲的气质，自尊心很强，“士可杀，不可辱”，多年治学的老教授，在大庭广众之中，一次次检讨，或在火力很强的群众大会上被斗争，有时人家原是热爱国家的，但却指着脸骂人家是反革命，那当然会使人感到无限委曲，抑郁难平，感情的创伤一时不易弥补，这是十分可以理解的。这是说当事的人，而其他群众呢？由于当时有人抓住一两句话，甚至和朋友说的开玩笑的话，就往往被人抓住，说是思想如何，甚至追其动机。运动过后，大家都不敢随便说话了，和党、团员说话时尤有戒心，知心朋友也不来往了，大有“逢人只说三分话，不可全掏一片心”的状态，形成貌合神离，同床异梦，党和知识分子中间的墙，有的地方就是这样筑起来的。
    吸收过去的教训，学会正确处理人民内部的矛盾
    陈垣接着谈到肃反问题，他说：总的来说，肃反成绩还是很大的，某校的副院长，肃反时被误作为对象，前天他和我说：“我当时确是难过得很，身体健康也差了。但是，今天平心细想，经过这次运动，全国反革命基本肃清，可以安心的建设了，这就是最大的成绩，我当时虽然吃些苦头，但从结果来看，问题还是弄清楚了，也并没有冤枉我。”他的话使我很感动，我想运动当中，群众发动起来，很多人在大运动里受了伤，如果仅仅说是“在所难免”，未免也是说便宜话，不过能从全国着想，总可稍稍解开这些症结。今天吸取过去的教训，学会如何正确的处理人民内部矛盾，也不会再有误友为敌的错误作法了。
    高教部边整边改的精神是得到广大群众欢迎的
    关于整风运动，陈垣认为：目前运动虽然刚刚开始不久，各方面已提出了许多许多意见，揭露了不少矛盾。党的各级领导干部一再表示让大家大鸣大放，对大家帮助党整风一再表示欢迎与支持，虚心倾听群众意见，昨天人民日报登载的高教部接受正确的批评和建议，选派留学生将采取自由报考方式，这种边整边改的精神，是得到广大群众欢迎的。这次运动的本身，就是古今中外，史无前例的。
    谈到教学，陈垣认为：有些问题要注意，有些年青教师，毕业不过二、三年，上课去按本宣读，就很不好。这样的情况在我们国家文化事业迅速发展，实际的教师队伍人数还不能马上充实起来，还不能跟上形势的时候，这些青年教师，勇敢的担负起以他们的力量还不能担负的重担，担负起繁重的教学任务，是很不容易的。但是与这同时，也确实有些人，由于自己政治上进步，是党员或团员，课程也开出来了，如果再加上组织上有宗派主义情绪，他们就骄傲自满起来，老教师也看不在眼里了，觉得他们落后，认为老教师教的东西是唯心主义，只有自己才是最掌握马列主义的人，自然就不会很好的虚心的向老教师学习，所谓新老关系也逐渐不好起来。
    党群之间虽有墙但不是万里长城
    陈垣还谈到党群之间的“墙”的问题，他说：虽然有“墙”，但我看不是历史上的万里长城，第一因为城里城外不是敌对的双方，第二也并不是蜿蜒万里不断，而是断断续续，有高有低，有厚有薄，而且有些地方是没有“墙”的。我觉得既然各人处境不同，看法不同，接触的党员的作风也不同，是高就说高，是低就说低，有就说有，没有就说没有，不应人云亦云，强求一致。
    历次运动，在有些人心里留下一些印象，以为越说得头头是道，越能表示自己积极，据说在肃反运动时，有的单位开会时不说话，就被认为不能站稳立场，不能划清界限，我想这是个别的情况。但是有人却误以为有一说三，有薄说厚，就足以表现自己的错误。这纵然是极少极少的人如此，但也确实不能说没有这种现象。
    批评应该是：事实力求确凿，意见力求尖锐
    陈垣认为：批评时实事求是，对于党的整风，纠正错误，加强团结，改进工作，是有利的。有时因为爱护党，维护党的事业，谈到工作上严重的错误和缺点时，自然不免声色俱厉，“疾恶如仇”，是很可理解的。但如果只是漫骂和讥讽，或者无中生有，不能以理服人，对于工作的改进，反不能达到预期的效果。言之无物，持之无理，你让人改正什么呢？所以批评时应作到：事实力求确凿，意见力求尖锐，对工作的改进才能真正有帮助。陈垣最后谈到统战工作，他说：党、团员、民主党派成员，都有组织关系，而统战工作对无党派的人应当如何作工作，今后也值得注意。有时某一问题，党内和民主党派分别传达，而无党派人士，感到知道得很少。目前还是无党派的人数较多，恐怕将来也仍然如此，既然要调动一切力量，建设社会主义，则不但要注意发挥民主党派力量，对无党派的人注意加强连系，也应注意。
    龙云说：希望参加座谈会的人拿出勇气抓住重点放胆批评
    龙云发言中说：此次整风运动，主要反对宗派主义，官僚主义，主观主义，所谓“三害”，包括教条主义在内。他说，他对张奚若先生、章乃器先生、陈叔通先生、章伯钧先生及其他的先生在座谈会上的发言非常钦佩。他认为这些发言完全是对事不对人，真正所谓“知无不言，言无不尽”。如果每次座谈会能够贯彻这一精神的话，他相信共产党在这次整风中一定会得到很大的帮助。他又说，不过还有一些人的发言仍有顾虑，甚至顾虑很大。为什么会有顾虑呢？他认为原因就在于过去的几次运动使他们害怕了。他说这种心理是可以理解的。但是，他认为这次运动是帮助共产党整风，同以往的历次运动完全不同。首先要信任共产党，信任毛主席。有此信心，就用不着有什么顾虑，如有顾虑，就是不信任共产党了。因此，他希望参加座谈会的人拿出勇气、抓住重点、放胆批评，无关的话，用不着的话少说。他认为，缺点和错误揭露得越多，将来缺点和错误减少得也就会越多，相反，如果把缺点和错误掩饰起来的话，将来缺点和错误还会是很多的。
    接着，龙云对共产党的错误和缺点产生的根源作了分析并提出他的看法。他认为这几次的座谈会，大家所指出的错误和缺点，多半是在下面，而其根源多半是在上面。他认为在国家的行政上没有作到分层负责，而是国务院指示一发，等于垂直领导，就一直贯彻到基层，党有党的指示，就成为双轨并行，没有注意业务部门的职权，业务部门也就无法帮助下面，置于可有可无之地，很多错误和混乱便由此产生，对问题不暇再加考虑和研究。希望国务院以后多注意监督与考核，凡属业务无论专门与普通，都要主管负其全责。他还认为，上面发布指示之前往往没有全面地深刻地考虑，把天下事看得太易。在国家来说是求治心切，企图百废俱举，殊不知下面办事的人员经验不足，业务不熟，事体复杂而繁重，以致不能因地制宜、应付裕如，只能按令而行，造成紊乱，这也就产生了官僚主义。他举例说，比如往年的教育事业一直在扩大，今年的教育事业突然要压缩，结果使得国家感到困难、主管部门感到困难、社会和家庭都感到困难。这是冒进，也是轻率。又比如去年提倡穿花衣服，今年又提倡穿补钉衣服，使得下面无所适从，莫明其妙，这种宣传同样说明是一种轻率。
    他对这次整风运动中准备贯彻边检查边改进的精神十分赞成。他说，过去我们国家考取留学生的办法不公道，最近不少人提出批评，昨天报纸上登载了高等教育部接受大家的批评立即加以改进，这使人们的观感为之一新。他认为，今后整风运动如果能够贯彻这种精神，他相信我们党和国家的工作面貌一定会焕然一新。
    他对干部子弟的培养问题也提出了批评。他说，听说北京师范大学有个附中，现在改为一○一中学，学生完全是高级干部的子弟，其他的学生就不收。这样是不公道的，以学生来说，像这种学校培养出来的学生一定会感到高人一等，一定会有特权思想，于学生也是不利的，资本主义的君主国家听说有贵胄学校、贵族学校，平民一概不收。为什么我们社会主义的国家，也要设这种类似的贵族学校呢？我想来这也是一时高兴，缺乏全面考虑的结果。
    最后，他对民族干部问题提了意见。他说，在民族地区工作的汉族干部，不尊重少数民族干部的职权，有包办代替的现象。少数民族实行自治之后，干部缺乏是事实，因此，成立之初，自治区的干部不能不用汉族。这是在所难免，但是现在少数民族的干部陆续培养起来了，应该使少数民族干部有充分锻炼和提高的机会，使汉族干部逐步减少，少数民族干部逐步增加，而且有职有权，真正自己当起家来，达到名副其实的自治。许宝驹说：人事干部太严肃，人事机构很神秘，这是一道较厚的墙。
    许宝驹发言说，一般群众，都觉得做人事工作的人太严肃，对于人事机构，感到很神秘，使人发生畏惧心理，产生一种隔膜。假定说这是墙，可以说是比较厚的墙。如何消除这种隔膜，是应该注意的。他还说，很多机关首长，为了了解情况，听取一部分人的汇报，是完全必要的，但是却常引起人们一些疑虑。比如，“汇报全面与否？正确与否？”使人疑神疑鬼。在这里，他举南昌市某被错关过的青年为例说，这些事情很容易使人联想到，当时是否有人向领导上汇报了不正确的材料，其中是否有打击报复问题。因此，首长以什么态度听取汇报，很值得研究。
    张云川认为：墙和沟是党员的特权思想造成的；积极分子是挖沟打墙的“义勇队”
    张云川在发言中，首先谈到他很喜欢提意见，而且很爱批评，因为他经常说话一开头就提缺点，过去曾被人认为思想落后，反党，扣了很多帽子。有些关心他的朋友曾劝他最好不要说话了，说了不见得有好处；要说也不要忘了那个公式：先肯定成绩，然后再谈缺点。他说，是不是我只看到缺点而看不到优点呢？不是的。只是觉得优点早已存在，有目共睹，用不着我再来说。把缺点说出，改正过来，使成绩可以更加巩固，对党和国家都有好处。不过，有些民主党派的同志只谈成绩不谈缺点，甚至把缺点也当成绩来加以颂扬，这种做法好像看见一个人要陷进泥中也不提醒一样，是很不好的，这也不是爱护共产党。现在那些过去认为一切都好的人也提缺点了，证明他们过去是看到了缺点但没有说，是否考虑到个人的利害得失？是否从前言不由衷？我觉得说真话比说假话好，虽然真话难听一些，假话好听一些。
    接着，张云川就他所看到和感到的一些缺点提出了意见和批评。
    关于墙和沟的问题，他说，我也同意有些人的看法，党和非党之间是有墙和沟的。造成墙和沟的原因，有人分析是由于党员有优越感、特殊感。他说，这种优越感过去对敌斗争有好处，但革命胜利以后就在党员思想上变换了位置。过去在革命斗争中，党员是站在群众中领导革命，革命胜利后，有些党员就站在群众头上脱离群众了。甚至有的人觉得自己有革命的特权，觉得别人是不革命或不配革命，只有自己是真革命、最革命。在日常生活中常有这种表现。比如在机关里有党员也有非党员，可是不管吃饭、娱乐，总是党员坐在一起，非党员坐在一起。拆墙填沟如果党员不先伸出手来，非党群众就不好先伸手，怕对方不握没意思。可能党员也有这种顾虑，但党经常教育党员团结群众，因此，主要责任还要党员负。
    张云川认为：在工作上、待遇上、工资上都表现了共产党员不是吃苦在前，享福在后，而是相反。
    另外，在工作上、待遇上、工资上，都表现了党员不是吃苦在前，享福在后，而是相反，形成特权，形成了墙。在这种情况下，尽管强调非党人员要建立主人翁感，但是仍会很自然地有作客思想雇佣思想。
    他说，造成墙沟，除了这些党员要负主要责任外，还有一些挖沟打墙的“义勇队”也起了很大作用。谁是义勇队呢？他认为就是积极分子。他说，解放后，各方面人士风起云涌都集中在共产党的周围，党有责任了解大家，如能广征博采，互相引证，可能要好一些。可是不这样作，只相信少数的人，把他们当做积极分子，依靠他们信口雌黄，就把谁进步谁落后排了队，使党和群众隔离开来。而这些人就假借党的威信吓唬人，无形间就在党群之间打起了墙，挖起了沟。其实，应该瞧不起这些没有改造或正在改造的小资产阶级分子的这种做作，但是党却信任他们、鼓励他们，说他们积极、进步、靠拢党。于是这般人就在群众中趾高气扬、盛气凌人，不但群众怕他们三分，就是民主党派的头儿脑儿也怕他们说什么而迁就他们。看戏因为抹了脸，很易辨别，而有些人作风不正，颠倒是非，又未抹脸，不好辨别。这种情形现在已好一些了，但还是存在，建议统战部注意一下。
    第二个问题，张云川谈到干部为人民服务的问题。他说，解放以来，一直强调为人民服务，但有些人好像并不觉得自己是为人民服务、当人民的勤务员，而在意识深处觉得自己是做官。“官”就是站在群众头上的人。我们有一千多万干部，如果都是官都站在群众头上，群众怎么受得了。我过去看过“夜未央”，印象很深，跟“真假巡按”差不多，官一层一层的，不管大官小官都站在群众头上。我有一种无政府主义思想，我觉得我们的干部只能有职务之别，而不应该因职务不同有高低贵贱之分。现在以官自居，大官不愿和小官谈话的情况是普遍存在，如不进行思想教育后果很不好。为什么在看戏、吃饭等场合也要官阶森严、官气十足呢？很值得考虑。上行就很难叫下不效。因为官气十足、官阶森严、生活悬殊，就很自然地会使人闹地位。
    张云川说：我觉得对旧社会的声名地位，在统战工作上应加以区别。
    第三是统战问题。张云川说，我很喜欢看水浒，但对梁水泊有些做法搞不通。比如玉麒麟卢俊义，原来和梁山泊并没有多大关系，但不晓得宋江为什么这么重视他，一定要把他拉上山坐第二把交椅，不知是否统战工作？而黑旋风李逵甚至柴大官人柴进也不受重视。我觉得对旧社会的声名地位，在统战工作上也应加以区别。有些人确实是有真才实学；有些人则是登龙有术，这并不光彩；有些人的声名地位是靠吹牛拍马得来的，对这些人的政治地位是否要照顾？我觉得统战工作统对了一个人会起好作用，统错了还要起副作用。
    张云川引用了对司马相如和卓文君的故事的评价以后说：今天很多事情都是如此：某人做是对的，某人做就不对。
    我思想上还有些未解决的问题。像司马相如与卓文君的故事，因为司马相如是名人、学者，别人就捧为才子风流，如果是没知识的人，就会说他是拐骗人口。张君瑞与崔莺莺的恋爱也是如此，因为张是才子，崔是佳人，就被认为是风流韵事；如果是贩夫走卒，就认为是和奸通奸。这是不是证明我们每个人思想上还有些不公道的想法？今天很多事情都是如此，某人做是对的，某人做就不对，很值得考虑。
    张云川建议：应该评价各民主党派在各个历史时期的作用，不要只讲共产党的历史。
    除了以上几点批评意见以外，张云川还建议在中国革命史中，对民主党派在各个历史时期的作用也给予应有的评价，不要只讲共产党的历史。因为虽然共产党是革命的主流，但民主党派也是支流、细流，也起了一定作用。
    对于人事部门的工作，张云川也提出了二点建议：一是最好有些年纪较大、社会知识较丰富的干部做人事工作，因为青年对旧社会情况不了解，在审查别人历史时容易割断历史，不能全面判断。二是人事部门能否另开一条路。现在社会上还有些人直接向政府请求解决工作问题。这些人很难得有反映情况的机会，反映了也不重视，人事部门是否能考虑一下。
    最后，张云川建议把对高级知识分子的思想改造、肃反工作的成绩和副作用，摸一摸，比较和总结一下。
    朱蕴山说：拆墙平沟不是东风压倒西风，问题是
    要加强领导不是削弱领导。
    我在南京视察，碰到省市党的方面，正在开展整风运动，要各民主党派帮助整风，现在机关学校企业各方面，均在纷纷鸣放，已经提出很多意见。我在南京民革座谈会上听到财政局科长陈家振说省市级机关党委对统战教育一般很差，例如建筑工程部庄部长在干部会上三次提到民主党派，把民革叫做中华革命党，曾给他提意见。他第二次会议还称民革为中华革命党。往下一般党团员总是把民主人士与老弱残疾并提。陈又说党委提拔干部尽是党团员，有一领导干部贪污被揭发，党委叫他在党小组会上检讨一下了事，群众有意见，他答复是怕失威信以后工作不好做。江苏邮电管理局副局长王良骏说，民革成员提意见有顾虑，他说江苏各县有七十多个邮电局长，85％以上是青年党员不懂业务，连一个懂业务的非党的副局长都没有。
    地方统战教育是不平衡的，有的不重视，有的也很重视，类如苏州是个古老城市，党与非党同志团结很好，因为统战部很热心帮助，很多老知识分子古典文艺较有修养的人士视政协为老人之家，他们靠拢党，学习亦很起劲。这说明任何地方任何单位能把党的统战教育能够贯彻下去，对于民主党派就不至于轻视，团结工作就可以做得好的。
    为什么党中央发动整风运动呢，我想中国共产党过去也曾犯了好多次的错误，遵义会议由于毛主席领导，扭转过来，到了1942年整风统一了党内思想认识，纠正了歪风，朋友越来越多，得道多助，从此工人阶级壮大起来，因而领导抗日战争解放战争，推翻了国民党反动统治，建立人民共和国，近八年来，党又进行社会主义一系列的改造，已完成新民主主义革命进到社会主义新的阶段了，今天执政的党，成为六亿人口的大国最高领导核心，党的威信，达到最高峰，如果有部分党员，不能执行党的政策，或者思想硬化，仍停留在抗日战争或解放战争和近八年来社会主义改造那些阶段，那就不能够适应新的政治任务。钢铁锈了，不重新锻炼是不好用的。因此必须来一次整风运动，这一次整风运动，是个伟大的及时的英明措施，其目的是把马克思列宁主义处理人民内部矛盾神圣的武器拿出来向社会主义进军，透过这一次运动，预期结果一定是很健康的，他把六亿人民除开极少数反革命分子一致的团结在党的周围，将由社会主义直达共产主义之路，这是毫无疑义的。
    民主党派为什么要帮助整风呢？我觉得各民主党派过去与共产党患难相处，或先或后都有他历史因素，长期共存也不是偶然的，我们帮助党的整风亦即是帮助我们自己。我们经过了曲折迂回道路，然或先或后在共产党领导下多已投入新民主主义革命，现更进一步踏上社会主义新的历史阶段了，我们一方面帮助党的整风，同时结合我们自己思想改造工作，在这一次和风细雨伟大的运动中，我们学习马列主义处理人民内部矛盾的神圣的武器，我们边帮边学思想是可以得到提高，我们各方面工作也可以推进一步得到改善。讲到党与非党之间墙和沟问题，我在南京曾经讲过，我总觉得墙与沟是双方建筑起来的，我想对党员要求应该高些，他们的责任应较重些。有些墙沟是人为的，有些墙沟可能因工作制度产生的，无论如何，需要大家一齐动手，多鸣、多放，大胆的鸣，大胆的放，将问题一齐摆出来，就是碰到坚固堡垒，边整边改那是不难拆除的。在拆墙平沟的时候，各人看法不同，提法不同，都不要紧，目的只有一个，为了改进工作，为了社会主义建设，有些机关学校企业部门发生墙沟很多，是不是把党委从机关学校一齐退出，把公方代表一齐从企业部门退出，那就是拆墙平沟呢？我认为拆墙平沟不是东风压倒西风，问题是要加强领导不是削弱领导，社会主义事业没有共产党领导核心那是搞不成功的，有人提出以党代政、或以党代校，工作制度上有些不合倒是值得研究的问题。我个人认为不管在制度如何研究，亦只有从调整关系，改进领导方法上着眼，党是建设社会主义领导核心，这次整风运动正是为了加强这个领导核心，推动我们伟大的社会主义事业向前迈进。我对统战部还有几点意见提供出来请予考虑：
    （一）肃反运动是有成绩的，过去通过群众路线来肃反，也是正确的，要根据有反必肃有错必纠的方针，那是更无可疑义的。问题是在执行工作方面部分的发生偏差，把肃反面扩大化了。我建议在本年人大代表会议后，人大常委会和政协常委会应即召开联席会议根据毛主席在最高国务会议的指示，迅即组织一个临时检查机构，会同有关机关方面分往各地认真检查，所谓肃反遗留问题，依我看来不外四种情况，要根据四种情况分别处理：（1）根本搞错了的，应彻底平反，并赔礼道歉。曾经在什么样规模的群众会上宣布有罪，现在也应该在同样规模的会上宣布无罪，使被错斗了的人，在精神上得到安慰。（2）没有搞错，但处理不适当，应根据肃反政策纠正。（3）仅有嫌疑而无确凿证据、或仅因历史不清而发生怀疑者，均应早作结论不拖尾巴。（4）没有搞错而予以宽大处理的，应该向他说明白不能跟着嚷“平反”，不许翻案。在纠正错误过程中，肃反运动，包括共产党员在内，有人说是不是需要检查呢？我想，也不应对领导肃反的干部泼冷水。
    （二）有些机关党委对于民主党派不够重视，建议党中央做出决定，明确指示中央机关及各地方各基层党委，认真负责定期召开党派座谈，加强领导，务须贯彻统一战线教育方针，并帮助各民主党派做好工作。
      （三）民主党派机关干部工资标准比政府机关为低，福利也较差，升迁也较困难，拿民革中央机关来说，在体制上没有处一级的设置，直属部以下的组织，只相当于政府机关的科级，这在调级和提升受到较大的限制，一般的对于民主党派干部也有些轻视，因而很多干部容易产生不安心于党派机关工作，常闹情绪，这也无怪其然，建议由政协和统战部帮助各民主党派共同协商，比照国家机关的人事制度，拟定民主党派管理办法。
    另外民革在各地联系的社会人士和失业成员，很多在就业和安排方面承统战部大力帮助，解决了不少问题，我们是很感谢的，最近个别地方反映，通过组织排队分别缓急急需解决，请有关方面解决的尚未解决，而有些通过私人路线却先解决，发生不平衡现象，使地方负责人陷于被动。他们希望以后多予联系。
    刘斐说：党不应该代政，就像开机器的人不能代替机器一样。
    刘斐发言说，现在在党政关系中，有些上分下不分，早分晚不分，此分彼不分，而且越到下级，特别是县以下，就只看见党，看不见政的现象。下面的人民代表大会也开得很不正常。这种情况的产生，主要是建国不久，法制尚不完备，某些高级干部和许多中下级干部法制观念薄弱，以及缺乏民主作风等原因所造成的。党中央对这方面的情况注意不够，也不无影响。要改变这些情况，除开进行思想整风之外，还必须在一般党员干部之间加强法制思想教育，迅速制定必要的法律，健全各种必要的制度，尤其是人事制度，以划清党政关系。而且党员应以身作则，尊重国家机关的职权。不然，整风虽然能收一时之效，但却缺乏经常的法制保证。
    他说，党和政是两个性质不同的系统，党是领导国家事业的核心，但是，党的领导要通过国家机器去实现，党不应该代政，就像开机器的人，不能代替机器一样。但是，有些党员，不了解这种关系，而要把一切都抓在手里，连评级评薪也要高人一等。以为这样才是实现了党的领导，提高了党的威信。这是让国家机关生锈的作法，而且会滋长“三害”，加深人民内部矛盾。
    刘斐在发言中，还曾谈到，在基层组织中发生的很多问题，是同我们的事业发展太快，任务太重有关系的。他说，领导机关时常把很多任务、很多政策，一起往基层堆，他们消化不了、接受不了，发生问题是必然的。
    刘斐还曾谈到党在团结、改造和使用知识分子方面的一些问题和意见。
    他说，过去有些地方没有很好地执行知识分子政策，使一些人受了委屈，以后团结工作也没有作好，他们有意见。要改变这种状况，一方面要有错必纠，为受了委屈的人恢复名誉，另方面要加强对党员的教育，使他们改变对知识分子的强硬态度。这些人也就会消除成见，体谅过去产生错误之难免。
    陈绍宽说：福建省党外人士踊跃揭露矛盾，帮助党进行整风。
    陈绍宽说，我是奉调来京参加国家预算会议的，统战部也给我这机会来参加座谈会，我觉得很荣幸。
    我是从福建来的，请让我谈一点福建的有关情况。福建同全国各地一样，也是正在学习毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，以备投入正在展开的整风运动，省统战部也曾召开过几次座谈会，讨论内部矛盾，帮助整风，省人民代表大会第四次会议前几天才开过，这次会议更加发扬了民主，人民代表和列席人员都踊跃揭露矛盾，分析矛盾，解决矛盾，帮助党推行整风运动，并提出意见促进国家的社会主义建设。在福建党的同志与非党人士平时相处很好，中共省委和省人委领导同志态度谦和，对民主党派人士时多照顾，通过政协，统战工作做得很好，省政协的主席就是省委书记，政协常务副主席就是统战部长，政协秘书长是一位统战部副部长，民主党派负责人也都是省政协的副主席，每星期均到会办公，又参加集体办公会议，这说明党的同志与非党人士时相见面，协商事情，民主党派负责人能与统战部负责人常常见面，遇事商量，彼此就不隔阂。此外，党员对知识分子、民主人士等也很接近，因为省政协每星期六下午集体办公之后，就有组织教育、文化、卫生、工商业等各部门人士轮流交谈，谈后留餐且有文娱，中国人习惯三杯黄酒就感觉亲密起来，他们的心内困难的话就谈出来了，党和政府能立即解决的，就为解决，较难的亦设法研究解决，这样既可消除隔阂，又能够解决困难，使党、政府与群众上下通气。平时有事就讲，放和鸣都做惯了。党的同志对我更没有什么矛盾和隔阂，并且对我很重视，也很信任，许多重要事情先期都和我协商，对我密切关怀和照顾，不少会议不必党外人士参加的，有时我也被请参加，平时交往，更是亲密，如一家人一样，没有见外，我也没有自外，当我年初患了重病的时候，中共省委和省人委领导和负责同志们对我更是十分密切关怀，他们为我好几次召集名医会商诊治，特由上海延请名医专家到福建来，卫生厅长亲自指导和帮同救治，使我得以回苏，这更使我体会到共产党员的品质道德是这样高贵，我万分感激，这个事情所有在省民主党派人士都普遍知道的，非常感动了社会人士。党的同志们平时对其他民主党派人士也是很接近，很和蔼的，特别是省统战部对民主党派很多的帮助，解决困难，解决问题，在省人民代表大会和省政协也都发扬民主，遇事协商，省统战工作实在做得好。
    徐楚波说：各方面对中小学教师指责多，鼓励少。
    徐楚波发言说，各方面对中小学教师是指责多，鼓励少，以致使中小学教师情绪低落，信心不足。他说这是因为对中小学教师重要性估计不足、重视不够。他谈到北京有的学校要教师给孩子道歉，中国青年报发表的“好厉害的七十二条”，都曾使中小学教师情绪受到影响。“人民教育”、“教师报”也不了解教师的痛苦，对教师多所指责，因此许多教师不愿意看“教师报”。他还谈到对教师的使用多，照顾少。如有的地方体育教师平时工作任务很多，星期日都不能休息，但有球类等比赛的时候，买票困难，有关方面也不予照顾。他谈到，党和国家的领导人，其他各界代表都接见过，却没有接见过中小学教师。在福利待遇方面，教师也是较低的。他说四川有的地方的教师的宿舍很简陋，而附近工厂职工宿舍却是高楼，真有天渊之别。小学教师的工资也不如工人，因此教师愿去工厂工作而不愿留在学校。他说，工资待遇，政治待遇，再加上社会上一般人对中小学教师不够尊重的看法，使很多中小学生不愿意考师范。
    他还谈到，各地学校的统战工作作得是不平衡的。有的学校里，党与非党人士处得好，有的学校里，党员有宗派主义。他说，有宗派主义的地方，党员校长和党支部书记多半都是青年人，不大懂业务，和老教师闹不团结。他们认为老教师落后，老教师认为他们不懂业务，彼此看不起。上级在提拔干部时，多是重德不重才，党员团员就行。提拔以后，就派到各个学校担任校长、教导主任等职务。这些年青人又不虚心和老教师相处，向老教师学习。而教育行政部门了解工作情况，又是只听他们的汇报。他说，他在四川视察的时候，当地教育局介绍他到一个学校去视察，这个学校是被认为党与非党关系不错的学校，校长是优秀校长。可是实际情况并不如此，教师提出的很多严重意见，甚至是一般学校少见的。他还谈到，北京有一个学校校长和党支部书记有宗派主义，引起老教师不满。教育局去调查，向学校党支部了解情况，没有解决问题；教师又向北京日报写信，北京日报去人调查，也是向党支部和人事部门了解，也没有解决问题。最后教师给他写了信，他把信转给教育局，到现在一年多了，也没有下落。吴研因认为：本报的“周建人同意‘拆墙’须从两面来拆”的标题是“暗示党外人士不必多嘴”。他认为这等于向党外人士说：“去你的吧，你还是回去闭门思过。”
    吴研因发言中说：我们的座谈会在第九次（22日）座谈时，我没有列席，可是我对座谈会的发言，仍很注意。我首先注意人民日报的记载。23日人民日报对座谈会的记载，用特号大字标题，标出“讨论逐步转向深刻化”。于是，我就细心地找了一下大家的发言是怎样的深刻。后来看到用二号字排印的小标题，“周建人同意‘拆墙’要从两面来拆”，才恍然大悟人民日报所谓深刻化是对周建老发言的赏识，他的发言，是强调同意民主党派也要拆墙，就是要思想改造。我们没有谁否认过思想改造。帮助党整风，也是学习，也就是思想改造的过程。不过在现阶段，只能强调整党整风，拆墙，拆“三害之墙”。因为现阶段三害之墙只是在开始拆，而且远远没有拆到下层的墙。比如民进的中小学教师会员就在喁喁向望，希望在下层拆墙时，他们也有机会帮拆。身为民进领导，不代表中小学教师讲话，却强调要思想改造，这好像要在党拆墙时，我们来唱对台戏，就是要自行拆墙，不必帮党拆墙，大有消极怠工之意。毛主席在4月30日的最高国务会议上，对整风运动提出了指示，他说现在是党要整风，要民主党派帮助党整风，并不是要民主党派整风；还说理论学习也可以停下来，否则会冲淡整风运动。我认为周建老的话，至少是会冲淡整风运动的。因此，我不同意，民进有不少同志也不同意。
    我对周建老的发言固然不满意，但并不想发言反驳，因为周建老有他自己的言论自由，我们虽然不同意，也用不着加以反驳。可是人民日报却竟赏识周建老的发言，认为深刻化，人民日报是甚么用意？是不是怕别人帮党拆墙，拆得太厉害了，暗示党外人士不必多嘴，还是自己去改造思想，拆思想之墙，换句话说，“去你的吧，你还是回去闭门思过，不必来插手了”。
    因为人民日报的态度是如此，所以写了一篇短文，给光明日报记者转给人民日报。那文的意思虽然是针对周建老的发言而发的，但实际是“项庄舞剑，志在沛公”，实际是对人民日报有意见。这篇文章是24日写的，25日送去的，到今天没有见登出来。这或者是因为人民日报的稿件太多，或者因为不合于人民日报的意思。总之我不理解人民日报所谓的深刻化是什么意思，是不是我所理解的那样？
    最后声明：那篇短文送人民日报，不是一定要人民日报发表。当时认为统战部不再开会了，所以写了书面的意见。如果早知道统战部今天还要开会，那我就可能在会上讲，不必写那文了。
    刘文辉提出保护公民权利的问题
    刘文辉谈的是有关保护公民权利的问题。他说，在过去，各级干部一般都不能很好地区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，又据近来整风中揭露的事实来看，在全国范围内，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义相当普遍。这些不能不侵犯到公民权利。因为基层干部需要的人太多，一般的文化水平和政治水平不及上层和中层干部，很容易把人民内部矛盾作为敌我矛盾来处理，如果再加上有些人的骄傲自满，作风粗暴，以至于违法乱纪，那末，公民权利遭到严重的损害就更不待说。他说，关于这个问题，本来党和国家早就注意到了，因此在宪法第九十七条明文规定：“中华人民共和国公民对于任何违法失职的国家机关工作人员，有向各级国家机关提出书面控告或者口头控告的权利。由于国家机关工作人员侵犯公民权利而受到损失的人，有取得赔偿的权利。”这条给公民权利提出了有效的保证，也可以说是赋予公民以一种保护权利的权利。但是普通公民处在有些基层干部强迫命令的作风之下，是否都能有效地行使了宪法赋予的控告权呢？国家机关对公民权利因干部违法侵犯而受到的损失，是否都依照宪法给予了赔偿呢？他认为事实上还有问题。特别是对公民权利被侵犯的损害赔偿，好些机关都没有给以应有的重视。
    他说，历史上剥削阶级的政府，对人民的剥削压迫极为残酷，根本说不上保护公民权利的问题。但他们的政权毕竟是脆弱的，他们的力量毕竟是分散的，他们的命令不是经常都能贯彻的，好些时间都是政令不出都门，加以社会的组织不严密，因此好些人民在紧急关头可以想出种种办法去躲避。他说，今天，不仅是人民政权和旧政权的性质有着根本的区别，而且国家出现了空前的统一，人民的政权表现出无比的坚强，政府的法令随时都得到充分的贯彻，领导的决定每样都做到彻底的执行，也是历史上任何时代都不能相比的。只有这样，才能为实现幸福的社会主义社会和美满的共产主义社会提供保证，这是我们政治制度的最大优越性。他说，但是，毛主席教导我们看问题要看两面，在这种情况之下，如果遇到国家执行政策的干部，不用说他是违法乱纪，不用说他把人民的内部矛盾作为敌我矛盾来处理，就是他体会政策的精神不够，发生了较大的偏差，老百姓也就吃不消；又因社会的组织十分严密，今天就没有躲避的可能。这时候老百姓应当怎样办呢？只有依法行使控告权了。说到行使控告权，恐怕有些老百姓到现在还不知道，纵然知道，也不是没有顾虑的。顾虑他控告不胜怎么办？顾虑他控告胜了，对方也不过检讨一番，将来借故报复，又怎么办？要控告都还有困难和顾虑，更说不上行使损害赔偿权了。他说，我国民间流传一句老话：“不怕官，就怕管。”基层干部经常和老百姓接触，他们直接左右老百姓全家的利害祸福。因此老百姓的顾虑重重，以致不能主动地行使宪法所赋予的控告权和损害赔偿权，就不是什么难于理解的事情，这样，人民内部的矛盾可能由此越是加深了。
    他认为党今后必须充分注意到这一方面。他并提出三点建议：（一）加强基层干部的政治思想教育，把整风运动贯彻到基层去，从思想认识上来解决问题，这是根本办法。（二）厉行革命法制，首先是严格执行宪法第九十七条的规定，保障公民都能充分地行使控告权和损害赔偿权。过去一个干部损害人民权利，往往是检讨一番就算了事，今后如果给他加上损害赔偿的责任，对干部的教育意义将会深刻得多。（三）加强人民代表和国家监察机关的监督作用。古语说：“徒法不能以自行”。宪法已经公布三年了，公民的控告权和损害赔偿权到今还没有得到充分的行使，缺乏有效的监督也是一个重要的原因。人民代表有保护选民权利的义务，国家监察机关有贯彻革命法制的职责，党和政府应当加强他们的责任，使他们为保障人民权利而有效地发挥监督作用。他认为如果能够从多方面想办法来保护公民权利，将大大地有助于人民内部矛盾问题的解决。
    李俊龙根据在东北等地区的视察情况，提出高等院校和厂矿企业统战工作中存在的问题。
    李俊龙在发言中，根据他在东北等地区视察十六个院校、两个科学研究机构以及若干厂矿企业的情况，提出了高等院校和厂矿中统战工作存在的问题。这个问题他分七个方面来谈：
    一、加强厂矿企业、院校中的统战工作。他说，富拉尔基的一位区长兼作统战部长，很多工程技术人员难得见他一面。富拉尔基是新兴工业地区，城市建设和供应任务很重，很显然，区长兼作统战工作，只能顾此失彼。他说，很多院校的政治思想教育工作，都作得不够好。但是，群众在这方面的要求很迫切。因此他希望今后向群众作一些时事政治报告，特别是学术报告，不要非限定党员去作，而应该设法多发挥民主党派成员作用。党委今后应该更好地运用民主党派组织的力量。
    二、若干新兴工业城市的政治思想工作很差，对非党的技术人员注意不够。
    三、工会工作不强，工作作得太不好。他说，东北友谊农场的工会只收会费，不作别的工作，文娱活动也没有人管。
    四、评级评薪解决了许多不公平现象，但也带来许多新问题。他说，过去，有些地方在评级时重德多，对业务、资历重视不够。有的老教授，工资评得不如毕业不久的大学生多。原因之一是有些做人事工作的青年人，工作很努力，但对旧中国情况了解得少，对旧知识分子、旧人员的看法不适当。他认为人事工作是可以让党外人士参加的。
    五、学校中的等级制度太森严。他说，东北师范大学有的教授见校长要两天以前登记。开晚会的时候，先长（包括科长）后教授，引起教授的不满。他认为这种情况应当改变。
  六、对新党员、新团员要进行统战教育、旧中国知识的教育和革命传统的教育。他说，很多新党员对旧中国的知识不多，对革命艰苦也了解不多，以党和毛主席的威信，作为骄傲资本。他还认为，现在共产党有一千二百万党员，今后接受知识分子入党不必那样快。有的新党员入党以后，觉得自己是党员，对老教授的态度就变了。
    七、他建议高等院校的党委，可考虑由省委领导，而不要由市委领导。同时，他希望今后省委书记、副书记、文教部长多管一管学校，多检查一些统战工作，那样党与非党关系可能会好一些。（编者注：在座谈会上罗子为的发言和陈其尤、茅以升的书面发言明日续登）
