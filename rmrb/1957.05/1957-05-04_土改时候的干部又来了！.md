"The cadres of the land reform era are back!"
By our reporter Gu Lei

This year, a new atmosphere has emerged in the rural areas of Gansu Province: some county party secretaries, ministers, district party secretaries, district heads, township party branch secretaries, township heads, and work team members are buying iron shovels and carrying baskets to help farmers repair canals, carry sand, dig wells, collect manure, and water the land; they are sharing weal and woe with the masses and leading production in production. The peasants have seen the change in the work style of the cadres and praise them, saying: "The cadres of the land reform era are back!"

Where has the fine tradition gone?

The peasants clearly remember what the work style of the cadres was like during the land reform period: for the benefit of the vast number of peasants, they rarely considered personal gains or losses. The dirty thatched huts of the poor peasants were their dormitories, offices, and classrooms for political and ideological education; beside a small table on the kang, they ate with the peasants, called each other brothers, recalled the painful years of the past, and yearned for the beautiful prospects of the future; they slept with the peasants, patiently taught them the methods of struggle, and tried every means to encourage the peasants' courage to struggle; in order to enable all the poor peasants to turn over economically completely, they repeatedly investigated the economic life of each peasant household, fearing that there would be uneven distribution of suffering and happiness during the distribution of land; they regarded going deep into the masses and becoming one with the peasants as an important method of transforming their own thinking. They were honored that the peasants regarded them as relatives and that the peasants could always tell them what was on their minds.

However, in recent years, many cadres have become accustomed to squatting in offices to hold meetings and issue instructions. Sometimes when they go down, they only summon township and commune cadres to report, give general instructions, and make a cursory inspection, rarely understanding specific problems. Some cadres dress impeccably and go to the countryside with good food, looking like "officials," disdaining to sit with the peasants to eat and talk. Some county and district cadres are like this, and township cadres have learned it too. Some township people's committees have also become bureaucratic. In addition to relaying instructions from higher levels, township cadres also pull commune cadres together for meetings and listen to reports.

It is difficult to move an inch when separated from the masses

The work style of being divorced from the masses will never work, especially when rural problems become more complex after the realization of cooperation. For example, some townships in Gansu Province had a bumper harvest last year but failed to complete tasks such as grain purchase and public bonds. On the contrary, some townships, although not increasing production much, were able to complete their tasks smoothly. Why is this? The peasants of Gansu Province have always had experience in overcoming drought. Last year they had an unprecedented harvest, but this spring, with a slight drought, some peasants lost confidence in increasing production. Why is this? The living standards of the peasants in Gansu Province have generally risen. Last year they received more grain, but this year some people are not actively building water conservancy projects to strive for more grain, and some even think of going to the city as workers. Why is this? Everyone says that running communes democratically is good, but within the cooperatives, it is often not easy to implement. Why is this? In short, there are many problems in the countryside that cannot be thought of while sitting in the office. Since the beginning of spring, Gansu Province has only had two light rains, and drought still threatens agricultural production. Therefore, overcoming drought and striving for another bumper harvest on the basis of last year's bumper harvest has become the primary task of rural work. So, how can we ensure the smooth completion of this task? The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and some situations in the province, is determined to change the leadership style from top to bottom: on the one hand, it will transfer cadres to lower levels to strengthen grassroots leadership, and at the same time call on every cadre to go deep into the countryside, eat, live, and work with the masses, and specifically lead production.

Unable to sit still in the house

People with strong party spirit lead the way, and most of the cadres in the province's rural areas responded to the call of the provincial party committee. From then on, county and district-level cadres carrying sand, carrying soil, digging canals, digging wells, collecting manure, and watering the land appeared in the countryside. They went to the peasants' homes to eat and talk. The upper levels set an example, and the lower levels followed. The township cadres, seeing this, silently walked out of the office and went to the fields; the commune cadres, seeing this, also picked up a tool and went to the production team. Liu Kunxia, a broadcaster from the Shidong Township Broadcasting Station in Gaolan County, couldn't sit still in the house when she saw this situation, and also took two or three hours every day to help the agricultural cooperative carry soil. The director of the cooperative was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth and used this as a slogan to mobilize women to actively build water conservancy projects: "The little girl from Beijing is working, are you still squatting at home!" From then on, the peasants also became affectionate when they saw the cadres, pulling them to their homes for dinner. They no longer called them "chiefs," but called them by their first names. According to a rough calculation by Gaolan County, and according to the results of ideological investigation, among the two hundred and sixty-four cadres who went to the countryside, those who lived with the peasants and could specifically solve problems in production by participating in production accounted for more than 90%.

Much more effective than issuing instructions

Cadres participating in production and using exemplary actions to influence peasants not only improved the peasants' enthusiasm for production but also smoothly dispelled some of the peasants' concerns. For example, when Wang Zuoxian, secretary of the Yuantai District Party Committee in Gaolan County, and Yan Zhanxiao, the district head, were stationed in Daheng Township to lead the fight against drought, many people said that they could not get water and were unwilling to take action, fearing that they would waste their labor. They led the peasants to dig wells. At first, not many people participated. The two of them took the lead in digging, and the more they dug, the more people there were, expanding from a few people to more than five hundred people. They dug thirty wells in three days, and all of them saw water. One day it snowed, and most of the peasants participating in the well digging said they would not do it anymore. Wang Zuoxian and Yan Zhanxiao said: "This is a battle, no difficulty can stop us!" After saying that, the two continued to work. The others were happy and said: "What are we afraid of!" Everyone braved the wind and snow to dig wells. After the wells were dug, three hundred and ten mu of land were watered within ten days, forming a surge in water conservancy. Li Shijun, the district head of Shidong District in Gaolan County, Yang Renming, the secretary of the District Communist Youth League Committee, Duan Lianyun, a cadre of the District Women's Federation, and others worked in the Zhuangziping Cooperative. The peasants here originally had no habit of applying fertilizer. There were no toilets in their homes, and they all went to the hillside to defecate. Li Shijun and others mobilized everyone to collect manure, but no one went, and they said: "Call us to pick up manure? You don't even dare to smell it!" When Li Shijun and others heard this, they went to pick up manure early the next morning; after a few days, many peasants also picked up manure. If there was no water, the cadres took the lead in digging water; if the masses did not have the habit of applying manure, the cadres took the lead in sending manure. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was naturally encouraged, and their confidence in fighting drought was strengthened, which was much more effective than sitting in the office and issuing instructions.

Because the cadres participated in production and established a sincere relationship with the masses, the masses were willing to listen when they spoke. Of course, it is not right if the cadres cannot discover problems from the labor process and only appear as ordinary laborers. The cadres here paid attention to this problem and clarified that the purpose of participating in production was to lead production more specifically. Therefore, they discovered and solved many specific problems in the labor process. An Jikang, the secretary of the Yachuan District Party Committee in Gaolan County, bought an iron shovel this spring, went to the fields to work with the peasants, and got along very well with the peasants. He learned about and solved many problems that he could not have known in the past, which greatly facilitated the spring sowing work. An Jikang taught this method to all the cadres in the district, and everyone carried an iron shovel to the production team, saving many meetings, solving problems quickly, and making the masses happy.

Walking out of the quagmire of bureaucracy

Now, in Gansu Province, many cadres have walked out of the office, out of the piles of documents, and out of the quagmire of generalized leadership, and have gone to the cooperatives, production teams, water conservancy construction sites, the bottom of well shafts, and the kangs of peasants. How can this not make the peasants happy? How can this not make the peasants recall the image of the cadres during the land reform era! This change in the work style of the cadres will be a guarantee for increased production in the province. It is a huge ideological transformation movement because it is the most practical method to eliminate bureaucracy, overcome contempt for labor, overcome being divorced from the masses, and curb the development of hedonistic ideas. Turning it into a regular and conscious action will prepare very favorable conditions for rural construction and accelerate the process of rural prosperity.

### “土改时候的干部又来了！”

    “土改时候的干部又来了！”
    本报记者　顾雷
    今年，在甘肃省的农村里，出现了一种新气象：一些县委书记、部长、区委书记、区长、乡支部书记、乡长、工作组员，有的买铁锨，有的买背斗，去帮助农民修渠道、背沙、打井、捡粪、浇地；与群众同甘共苦，在生产中领导生产。农民看出了干部作风的转变，啧啧地称赞道：“土改时候的干部又来了！”
    优良传统哪里去了？
    农民都清楚的记得，土地改革时期，干部的作风是什么样子：为了广大农民的利益，很少考虑个人得失。贫苦农民肮脏的茅屋，是他们的宿舍、办公室、进行政治思想教育的课堂；在炕上一张矮脚小桌的旁边，同农民一起吃饭，称兄道弟，回忆过去痛苦的岁月，向往未来美好的远景；和农民睡在一起，耐心地教给他们斗争的方法，千方百计去鼓舞农民的斗争勇气；为了使所有的贫苦农民经济上彻底翻身，反复调查每户农民的经济生活状况，生怕分地时苦乐不均；把深入群众，和农民打成一片，当作改造自己思想的重要方法。他们为了农民把自己当亲人一样看待，为了农民能时刻向自己讲心里话而感到光荣。
    但是，近几年来很多干部只习惯于蹲在机关里开会发指示。有时下去，也只是召集乡、社干部汇报，作原则性的指示，蹓蹓地边子，很少去了解具体问题。有些干部打扮得一表非凡，带着好吃的东西下乡，很像个“官”样子，不屑与农民坐在一起吃饭、谈心。有些县、区干部如此，乡干部也学会了。有些乡人民委员会也机关化了。乡干部除了照转上级的指示外，就是拉社干部开会，听汇报。
    脱离群众寸步难行
    脱离群众的工作作风永远是行不通的，特别是在实现合作化以后农村的问题更复杂的时候。例如，甘肃省有的乡去年大丰收，却没有完成购粮、公债等任务，相反的有些乡虽增产不多，任务却能顺利完成。这是为什么呢？甘肃省的农民素有战胜干旱的经验，去年获得了空前的丰收，今年春天略有干旱现象，部分农民却失去了增产的信心，这是为什么呢？甘肃省农民的生活普遍地上升了，去年分得更多的粮食，今年有的人却不积极兴修水利争取打更多的粮食，甚至有人想到城市当工人，这是为什么呢？大家都说民主办社好，到了合作社内部，常常不容易贯彻，这是因为什么呢？总之，在农村中有许许多多是坐在办公室里想不到的问题在发生着。开春以来，甘肃省只落了两场小雨，干旱仍然威胁着农业生产。因此，战胜干旱，争取在去年丰收的基础上再来个丰收，成了农村工作的首要任务。那末，如何保证顺利完成这个任务呢？中共甘肃省委员会，根据中央的指示和本省的一些情况，决心从上至下转变领导作风：一方面抽调干部下放，加强基层领导，同时号召每一个干部深入农村，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，具体领导生产。
    在屋子里坐不住了
    党性强的人走在前面，全省农村中的大部分干部响应了省委的号召。从此，在农村里出现了背沙的、抬土的、挖渠的、打井的、捡粪的、浇地的县、区级干部，他们到农民家里吃饭，谈心。上行下效，乡干部一看，也不声不响地走出办公室下地了；社干部一看，也顺手拿起一样家伙下了生产队。皋兰县石洞乡广播站的广播员刘昆霞，一看这形势，在屋子里坐不住了，每天也抽出两三个钟头去帮助农业合作社抬土。合作社主任看到了，乐得合不上嘴，把这件事当成动员妇女积极修水利的口号：“北京来的小姑娘都干上了，你们还蹲在家里呀！”从此，农民见到干部也亲热了，拉着到自己家去吃饭。也不喊什么“长”了，直呼其名。根据皋兰县粗略的统计，又根据思想摸底的结果，在二百六十四名下乡的干部中，同农民生活在一起、并且能通过参加生产具体解决生产中的问题的干部占90％以上。
    比发指示有效得多
    干部参加生产，用模范行动去影响农民，不仅提高了农民的生产积极性，而且顺利地解除了农民的某些顾虑。例如，皋兰县源泰区区委书记王作贤、区长颜占崤在大横乡坐镇领导抗旱时，许多人都说打不出水来，不愿动手，怕白搭工。他们便带领农民去打井。开始，参加的人不多，他们俩带头去挖，愈挖人愈多，由几个人扩大到五百多人，三天打井三十眼，都见了水。一天下雪，大部分参加打井的农民都说不干了。王作贤、颜占崤说：“这是战斗，什么困难都挡不住我们！”说罢，两人继续干。其他人高兴了，说：“咱们还怕啥！”大家冒风雪打井。打好了井，十天内浇了三百一十亩地，形成了兴水利的热潮。皋兰县石洞区区长李世俊、区团委书记杨仁名、区妇联干部段莲云等，在庄子坪合作社工作。这里的农民原没有施肥的习惯，家里没有厕所，都到山坡上去大便。李世俊等动员大家去捡粪，谁也不去，还说：“叫我们去拾粪？你们连闻都不敢闻呢！”李世俊等一听，第二天一早便去捡粪；过了几天，不少农民也捡粪了。没有水，干部带头打出了水；群众没有上粪的习惯，干部带头去送粪。这样，自然鼓舞了群众的生产热情，坚定了抗旱的信心，比起坐在机关里发指示有效的多了。
    由于干部参加生产，同群众建立了真挚的感情，说起话来群众也愿意听。当然，干部如果不能从劳动过程中发现问题，只是以一个普通的劳动者的身分出现，那是不对的。这里的干部注意了这个问题，明确了参加生产的目的是为了更具体地领导生产，因而在劳动过程中发现和解决了不少具体问题。中共皋兰县崖川区委书记安吉康今春买了一把铁锨，走到地里去同农民一起劳动，同农民处得很亲热，知道了并解决了许多过去无法知道的问题，大大便利了春播工作。安吉康把这个方法教给全区的干部，大家都扛铁锨下生产队，省去许多会议，解决问题又快，群众还高兴。
    走出官僚主义的泥坑
    现在，在甘肃省，许多干部走出了办公室，走出了文件堆，走出了一般化领导的泥坑，到了合作社、生产队、兴修水利的现场、井筒底下、农民炕头上。这怎么能不使农民高兴呢，怎么能不使农民回忆起土地改革时候的干部形象呢！干部作风的这个转变，将是全省增产的保证。是一个巨大的思想改造运动，因为它是消除官僚主义、克服轻视劳动、克服脱离群众、遏止享乐思想发展的最切实的方法。把它变成经常的、自觉的行动，就会给农村的建设准备十分优越的条件，加快农村繁荣的进程。
