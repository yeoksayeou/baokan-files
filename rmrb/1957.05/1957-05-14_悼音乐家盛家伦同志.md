	In Memory of Musician Comrade Sheng Jialun
	As I write, Brother Sheng Jialun has already left us for two days. He was an outstanding and diligent music worker. He understood Western music and had a deep understanding of the vocal music of traditional opera. He had composed music for many dramas and film works. From his singing of "Song at Midnight," we know that he was also an excellent vocalist with rich emotions. But beyond all this, Jialun was a patriot who loved the motherland, loved the people, and hated aggressors and traitors! From the age of seventeen, he participated in the anti-imperialist struggle to reclaim the British concession. Later, in Shanghai, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Guilin and other places, he sang against Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's feudal fascism.
	Jialun was also a person who loved friends and was enthusiastic about helping them. But because his love and hatred were clear, he would sing loudly with good friends, talk intimately until midnight without getting tired, but would give a cold shoulder to those who were not suitable and would not say a word throughout the session. This attitude was most acute before liberation. Therefore, some people called him the "Hunchback of Notre Dame," but in fact he was a very understandable person.
	Jialun's research interests were very broad. He often sought to thoroughly find the answer to a question, going from this to that, persevering unremittingly. He was about to express his opinions on the creation of national music. His posthumous works have been discovered.
	He was a man of rich talent, but unfortunately his talent was not fully developed before his great aspirations were destroyed by sudden illness. At the beginning of his illness, he greatly regretted not paying attention to nutrition and a normal life order on weekdays. He wanted to correct these shortcomings after he recovered so that he could devote his strength to serve the people for a long time. But it was too late! This is worth our vigilance.
	I wrote a few poems to mourn Jialun.
	I
	With passion and a cold face I knew Jialun,
	Not all hunchbacks are weirdos?
	He never spared the young scoundrels a cold look,
	His red heart was always for the people;
	His youthful roar startled the Yangtze and Han rivers,
	His prime-age songs moved ghosts and gods.
	I still remember a boat in the wind and rain,
	The raging waves entered Tianjin.
	?When Jialun was seventeen years old, he participated in the movement to recover the British concession in Hankou in 1927. In the winter of 1948, Jialun sent me from Shanghai by boat to Tianjin and then to the liberated area. The journey was full of wind and rain and quite bumpy. When we arrived in Tianjin, we stayed in a hotel near Jin'gang Bridge. The Kuomintang rulers were conducting a major inspection. We had no identity cards and had to hire a car to find a relative's place to stay late at night.
	II
	The sound of drums is joyful under Tiananmen,
	He vomited his lungs and liver for peace.
	It was as if Zhou Yu knew the mistakes in the music,
	He always regretted the difficulty of Nie Er's talent.
	He searched widely for maps and history to fill the building,
	He carefully studied palace music until late at night;
	Even if his bones turn to ashes, his heart will not die,
	Even when critically ill, he still wanted to eat more.
	?Jialun cooperated with Guang Weiran on the "Anti-Japanese Guerrilla" song, and also composed music for film and drama works such as "Defend Our Land", "Fight for Freedom and Peace", "Frontline Storms", "Long Live the Nation", "Little Man's Fantasia", "The Person Who Gets Slapped", "The Spring and Autumn of Drama" and "Resurrection". Recently, he also composed music for "Tears of Desolation".
	?Although Jialun was a new musician, he had a great understanding of the vocal music of traditional opera.
	?Jialun usually did not pay much attention to his life, sometimes hungry and sometimes full. The doctor found that there was very little subcutaneous fat. Jialun said that after he recovered, he would hire a nanny to increase his nutrition.
	III
	Jingzi's distant travels of death,
	The taste of good friends is most pitiful.
	Fine tobacco can add fantasy,
	Good books are enough to accompany a good sleep.
	The song is playing the music of that time,
	The musical theory still exists in an unfinished form;
	I'll call myself an "old bachelor" for life,
	I won't let red tears fall before you.
	?Jialun lived with Comrades Yu Jingzi and Song Zhidi in Qifeng Building, Guanyin Temple.
	?Jialun loved to smoke and had fine tobacco pipes.
	?The old work "Song at Midnight" was sung by Jialun. This film has recently been re-screened in various places.
	?Among Jialun's belongings were two manuscripts: "A Casual Discussion on the Guqin" (approximately 21,000 words) and "Preliminary Study of Indian Music and India's Oldest Musical Book" (approximately 22,000 words).
	?Jialun was not married at forty-seven, and people called him an "old bachelor," to which he responded with a smile.

    悼音乐家盛家伦同志	            田汉
    当我执笔的时候，盛家伦兄已经离开我们两天了。他是一位卓越精勤的音乐工作者，他懂西洋音乐，而对传统戏曲的声腔有很深的研究，他曾为许多戏剧电影作品配曲，从他所唱的“夜半歌声”，可知他还是一位情感丰富的优秀的声乐家，但超乎这一切，家伦是一位热爱祖国，热爱人民，痛恨侵略者和卖国贼的爱国者！他从十七岁起就参加收回英租界的反帝斗争，后来在上海，在重庆，在香港，在桂林各地为反日本帝国主义反蒋介石封建法西斯而歌唱。
    家伦又是极爱朋友，热心帮助朋友的人。但由于他爱憎分明，对好朋友们解衣高歌，促膝深谈，直到午夜不倦，而对那些不太合适的人便报以白眼，终席不发一言。这一态度在解放以前最为尖锐。因此曾有人称他为“钟楼怪人”，其实他是极可理解的人。
    家伦的研究趣味非常广博，常常为彻底追寻一个问题的解答，由此及彼，锲而不舍。他正想对创造民族音乐问题发表意见。他的遗著已有所发现。
    他是一个有富赡的才能的人，可惜他的才能还没有充分发挥就被突然的疾病摧毁了他的宏愿。在初发病的时候，他十分后悔平日不注意营养和正常的生活秩序。他想在病愈之后改正这些缺点，以便能把他的力量长期报效人民。但是迟了！这很值得我们警惕。
    写了几首诗哭家伦。	一
    热情冷面识家伦，
    未必钟楼尽怪人？
    白眼不曾饶竖子，
    赤心常是对人民；
    英年怒吼惊江汉，?
    壮岁高歌动鬼神。
    犹忆一舟风雨里，
    狂涛骇浪入天津。?
    ?家伦十七岁时在汉口读书就曾参加1927年收回英租界运动。?1948年冬家伦送我由上海乘船到天津转入解放区，一路风雨不止，颠簸颇苦，抵天津住金刚桥边一旅馆，国民党统治者正举行大检查，我们没有身份证，只得雇一汽车深夜找亲友处安身。	二
    天安门下鼓声欢，
    更为和平呕肺肝。?
    直似周郎知曲误，?
    每因聂耳惜才难。
    广搜图史充楼栋，
    精究宫商到夜阑；
    骨纵成灰心未死，
    病危犹愿再加餐。?
    ?家伦曾与光未然合作“抗日游击队”歌，又为“保卫我们的土地”、 “为自由和平而战”、“塞上风云”、“民族万岁”、“小人物狂想曲”、“吃耳光的人”、“戏剧春秋”、“复活”等电影和戏剧作品配曲。最近又为“荒山泪”配曲。
    ?家伦虽是新音乐家，却对传统戏曲声腔极有研究。
    ?家伦平时不甚注意生活，饥一顿，饱一顿。医生发现皮下脂肪甚少。家伦表示病好后一定雇一保姆，增加营养。	三
    静子远游之的死，?
    良朋况味最堪怜。
    佳斗差能添幻想，?
    好书真足伴高眠。
    歌声正奏当时曲，?
    乐论犹存未竟篇；?
    拼着一生称“处老”，?
    不教红泪落君前。
    ?家伦与虞静子宋之的同志同住观音寺栖凤楼。
    ?家伦爱吸烟，蓄有佳斗。
    ?旧作“夜半歌声”系家伦所唱，最近各地重映此片。
    ?家伦遗物中发现“漫谈古琴”（约二万一千字）与“印度音乐的初步研究与印度最古乐书”（约二万二千字）二稿。
    ?家伦四七未娶，人们称他为“处老”，他微笑应之。
          五月十一日
