Reading Newspaper Reference

    "Uncle Sam"
    According to the Encyclopedia Americana, in 1812, there was an official in Troy, USA, who specialized in inspecting government military orders. His name was Samuel Wilson, but his relatives and acquaintances called him Uncle Sam. At that time, all boxes containing government-ordered goods were marked with the initials U.S. (short for United States), and the initials of Sam and Uncle were also u and s. Therefore, people in Troy joked that these boxes belonged to Uncle Sam. Later, it gradually spread, and Uncle Sam became a code name for the United States. Uncle Sam's image is a slender old man with a goatee.
    "John Bull"
    This term first appeared in five political satire essays titled "The History of John Bull" written by Dr. John Arbuthnot in 1712. The word "Bull" also means "cow" in English. Later, this term was widely adopted as a nickname for Britain or the British. John Bull's image is a short, fat, stout gentleman dressed in 18th-century British clothing.

    “山姆大叔”
    据美国百科全书说，1812年，美国特罗城有一位专门检查政府军事订货的官员，名叫山姆尔·威尔逊，但是他的亲友和熟人都称他为山姆大叔。当时凡是政府订购货物的箱子，外面都标上U．S．两个英文字母（美国的简写），而山姆和大叔这两个英文字的开头字母也是u和s。因此，特罗城的人开玩笑说，这些箱子都是山姆大叔的。以后逐渐流传开了，山姆大叔便成了美国的一个代号。山姆大叔的形象是一个有着山羊胡子的瘦长老人。
    “约翰牛”
    这个辞最初出现在1712年约翰·阿尔布纳博士所写的“约翰·布尔的历史”的五篇政治讽刺论文里。布尔这个字在英文里也就是牛的意思。以后这个名辞被广泛采用为英国或英国人的绰号。约翰牛的形象，是一个矮肥粗壮穿着十八世纪英国服装的绅士。
