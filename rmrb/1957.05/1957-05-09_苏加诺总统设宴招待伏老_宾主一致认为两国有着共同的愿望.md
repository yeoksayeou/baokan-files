Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. President Sukarno hosted a banquet on the evening of the 7th to welcome Chairman Voroshilov. The two heads of state delivered speeches at the banquet.

    Sukarno mentioned the warm welcome he received during his visit to the Soviet Union. He said, "I am deeply convinced that my visit to the Soviet Union has successfully strengthened the friendship between the Soviet people and the Indonesian people." He said that all the Indonesian people hoped that Voroshilov, as a representative of the Soviet people, would personally see how deep the Indonesian people's friendship and brotherhood towards the Soviet people and Voroshilov himself was. He said he believed that although Voroshilov had only arrived for a day and a night, he "already believed that the Indonesian people are truly friendly to the Soviet people" and love Voroshilov himself. Sukarno said that there are many common aspirations between the Indonesian and Soviet peoples, and he believed that based on these common points, the friendship between the two peoples would become closer and more lasting.

    Voroshilov said that the Soviet people are closely concerned about the lives and destinies of the Indonesian people, that there is good understanding between the Soviet and Indonesian peoples, and that they hope to consolidate and develop the existing friendship between us. He said that our country and people truly sympathize with the Indonesian people's struggle to completely eliminate the remnants of colonialism. The Soviet Union has always supported the just demand of the Indonesian people to incorporate West Irian, Indonesian territory, into the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.

    Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union and Indonesia, like other peace-loving countries, are actively striving for peace. Our two countries oppose aggressive blocs, advocate the establishment of a collective security system, demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and demand universal disarmament. We are pleased to see that the Indonesian-Soviet relationship, based on the famous principles of international cooperation, is constantly strengthening, and we believe that for the common interests of the two countries and mutual friendship, the relationship between the two countries will further develop and consolidate.

    The Indonesian Prime Minister, First Deputy Prime Minister, Third Deputy Prime Minister, Speaker of Parliament, Speaker of the Constitutional Assembly, cabinet ministers, and foreign diplomatic envoys to Indonesia were invited to attend the banquet.

    After the banquet, Sukarno accompanied Voroshilov to the State Palace to watch a wonderful Indonesian art performance.
