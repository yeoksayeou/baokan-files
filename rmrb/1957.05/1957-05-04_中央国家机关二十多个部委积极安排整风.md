More Than Twenty Central Government Ministries and Commissions Actively Arrange Rectification

    (Our report) Central government agencies are actively studying and formulating rectification plans. The reporter initially learned about the situation of more than twenty ministries and commissions. A few units have already made specific plans, determined the main content of the rectification, and organized leading groups. The party groups of most units have begun to formulate plans after holding meetings. Some units will hold party group meetings in the next few days to study the matter.

    Determining the Main Content of Rectification

    After receiving the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, the party group and the party committee of the National Planning Commission determined to make the issue of planning work being divorced from reality the main content of this rectification. In this rectification, leading cadres in this department are required to focus on examining the following five issues: 1. The issue of comprehensive consideration and overall arrangement of various economic matters; 2. The issue of implementing the central government's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift; 3. The issue of the centralization, unity, and flexibility of planning work; 4. The issue of how planning work follows the mass line; 5. Issues such as leaders promoting democracy and putting down airs. The requirements for general cadres are: in addition to establishing a correct work attitude and wholeheartedly serving the people, this rectification should also enable everyone to further recognize the importance of planning workers being realistic, conducting investigations and research, and establishing a scientific work attitude.

    The Ministry of Light Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building held enlarged party group meetings and party group meetings respectively before May Day, and formulated plans to carry out the rectification movement. The Ministry of Light Industry has already formed a leading group, headed by Song Naide, the party group secretary. The responsible comrades of the party group of the First Ministry of Machine Building have already made arrangements for the bureau and division-level party member cadres to carry out the rectification movement.

    Rectification and Work Should Not Hinder Each Other

    The National Planning Commission studied the issue of ensuring that rectification work and work do not hinder each other. Based on the experience of previous movements, at the beginning of a movement, there is often an emphasis on work and a neglect of the movement; once this deviation is criticized, there is a tendency to focus on the movement and lose sight of the work. To solve this problem, the primary task is to establish a rectification leading group with members from all aspects. Because the members of the group come from all aspects, they will consider both work and the movement, and the possibility of deviations will be smaller. In addition to this, there should be specific arrangements for work and rectification study within a certain period, and the rectification leading group should adjust them at any time.

    In some units, there are many contradictions between leaders and the masses, and the problems are more complicated. They also recognize the necessity of carrying out a rectification movement. However, they still feel difficult about how to ensure that the rectification movement and the handling of current problems do not hinder each other. The leaders of individual units even plan to quickly deploy the rectification movement and then go down to solve the problems. In these units, there are also different opinions. They feel that without rectifying the work style and learning the correct method of handling contradictions among the people, going down will not necessarily solve the problems well, and may even make things worse. Individual units have also asked the leading organs what to do with the ongoing increase production and practice economy movement and the inspection of united front work. It seems that how to implement the policy of ensuring that rectification and work do not hinder each other and that rectification is combined with improving work is not clear enough in some units.

    Rectification Plans Should Not Be Pushed to Secretaries

    The Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement pointed out that the first secretary of the Party committee must personally take charge of the rectification movement and grasp the leadership firmly. The responsible comrades of the party groups of some units proposed the main content of this rectification study to the cadres under their jurisdiction half a month ago. However, according to the reporter's understanding, the responsible comrade of the party group of one unit entrusted the major task of formulating a rectification plan to the party group's secretary and the general cadres of the party committee, and only gave them extremely simple instructions, asking them to put forward a preliminary plan, and then the party group would hold a meeting to discuss it. After accepting such a task, these comrades felt at a loss and very embarrassed. This approach is obviously not very appropriate.

    What are the Departments Considering?

    Various departments have raised some solutions to certain problems, such as how to determine the main content of the rectification in their respective departments according to the characteristics of their departments, how to ensure that work and rectification do not hinder each other, and so on. Some issues are still under study.

    In the past month, all departments have studied Chairman Mao's two reports. Some units have studied them more thoroughly, raised many problems in their units, and initially studied what the main contradictions are; some units have not studied well and have not yet touched on specific problems. How to shift from study to rectification in these two types of units is one of the issues being considered by the leaders of each unit.

    Many units are considering how to ensure that leading cadres can rectify their work style well. In the previous stage of studying Chairman Mao's two reports, many cadres above the division and bureau level did not study well. This is because their thinking could not keep up with the development of the situation, and also because they did not pay attention to unifying the arrangement of work and study. If leading cadres do not rectify their work style well during the rectification, it will not only be detrimental to the work of their department, but also to the rectification of their unit.

    Originally, the general cadres thought that the rectification would not take place until next year, and did not expect that the situation would develop so quickly and that the rectification would begin immediately. The general cadres also lack ideological preparation for taking the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the theme. The leaders of each unit are considering how to quickly guide the thinking of the cadres to the aspect of rectification and quickly delve into it. In addition, how to eliminate the concerns of some cadres about the rectification is also an issue being considered by each unit.

### 中央国家机关二十多个部委积极安排整风

    中央国家机关二十多个部委积极安排整风
    本报讯　中央国家机关正积极研究和制定整风计划。记者初步了解了二十几个部、委的情况，有少数单位已经作出具体计划，确定了整风的主要内容，组织了领导小组。大多数单位的党组在召开会议之后，已着手制定计划。有些单位明、后天就要召开党组会议进行研究。
    确定整风主要内容
    国家计划委员会党组和机关党委在接到中央关于整风运动的指示以后，即确定以计划工作脱离实际的问题，作为这次整风的主要内容。在这次整风中，要求本部门的领导干部着重检查下列五个问题：一、各种经济统筹兼顾、全面安排的问题；二、贯彻中央勤俭建国的方针问题；三、计划工作的集中性、统一性和灵活性的问题；四、计划工作如何走群众路线的问题；五、领导者发扬民主、放下架子等问题。对一般干部的要求是：除了树立正确的工作态度，全心全意为人民服务等思想外，还要求通过这次整风，使大家进一步认识到计划工作者必须实事求是，进行调查研究，树立科学的工作态度的重要性。
    轻工业部和第一机械工业部在五一节前已经分别举行了党组扩大会议和党组会议，制定了开展整风运动的计划。轻工业部已经组成了领导小组，由党组书记宋乃德负责。第一机械工业部的党组负责同志已经向局、司长一级党员干部作了开展整风运动的布置。
    整风和工作两不误
    国家计划委员会研究了整风工作两不误的问题。根据以往历次运动的经验，运动开始，往往是重工作轻运动；一旦批判了这个偏差以后，又发生抓了运动丢了工作的偏向。要解决这个问题，首要的是成立有各方面成员参加的整风领导小组，由于小组成员是来自各个方面，既会考虑工作，又会考虑运动，发生偏差的可能性就会小一些。除此以外，对一定时期内的工作和整风学习，要有具体的安排，整风领导小组随时加以调整。
    有些单位，领导和群众之间的矛盾较多，问题比较复杂。他们也认识到进行整风运动的必要性，但是，对于如何保证整风运动和处理当前问题两不误，还感到困难。个别单位的领导者甚至打算把整风运动赶快部署一下，然后就下去解决问题。在这些单位中，也有不同的意见，他们觉得不整好风，不学会处理人民内部矛盾的正确办法，下去了也不一定会把问题解决好，甚至会把事情弄坏。个别单位还向领导机关提出，目前正在进行的增产节约运动和对统一战线工作的检查等，应该怎么办。看来，整风和工作两不误、整风和改进工作相结合的方针究竟如何贯彻，在有些单位还不够明确。
    整风计划不该推给秘书
    党中央关于整风运动的指示中指出，党委的第一书记对整风运动必须亲自负责，抓紧领导。有些单位的党组负责同志在半个月以前，就向所属干部提出了这次整风学习的主要内容。可是，据记者了解，有一个单位的党组负责同志却把制定整风计划这样的大事，委托给党组的秘书和党委会的一般干部去做，而且仅只给了他们极其简单的指示，要他们提出初步方案后，党组再开会讨论。这些同志接受了这样的任务后，感到摸不着底，非常为难，这种作法显然是不大妥当的。
    各部门在考虑些什么？
    各部门对某些问题，例如怎样根据本部门的特点，确定本部门整风的主要内容；怎样保证工作、整风两不误，等等，都提出了一些解决办法，有些问题还在研究。
    各部门在最近一个月当中，都学习了毛主席的两个报告，有的单位学习得比较深入，提出了本单位的许多问题，也初步研究了主要矛盾是什么；有的单位学习得不好，还没有接触到具体问题。这两种单位，怎样从学习转入整风，是各单位领导方面考虑的问题之一。
    许多单位都在考虑怎样保证领导干部整风整得好。在前一阶段学习毛主席的两个报告的时候，司、局长以上的干部，许多人都学习得不好，这是因为思想赶不上形势的发展，也是因为没有注意统一安排工作和学习。整风中间，领导干部如果整不好，不仅不利于本部门的工作，而且不利于本部的整风。
    本来，一般干部都以为明年才整风的，没有料想到形势发展得很快，整风马上就要开始了。以正确地解决人民内部矛盾为主题，一般干部也是缺少思想准备的。各单位的领导人都在考虑怎样很快地把干部的思想引导到整风方面，并且很快地钻进去。另外，怎样消除某些干部对整风的顾虑，也是各单位考虑的一个问题。
