Late at night, the stars in the sky showed some weariness, and how many people in the world were sound asleep...

At 3:25 in the morning, Elder Statesman 伏老 arrived in the front hall of his residence. He was wearing a gray suit, and his silvery-white hair was neatly combed. The old man first greeted the comrades on both sides with a "Good morning," then put his hand in his pocket, stood for a while, and took two steps forward. He didn't say anything, just smiled. Two minutes passed... The front hall was very quiet, and everyone could hear footsteps coming from outside. A comrade who came in first said to Elder Statesman 伏老, "He's here!" The old man seemed to be waiting for his closest relative and took two more steps forward, his right hand still touching his tie. Chairman Mao quickly entered. The hands of our most respected two chairmen were tightly clasped together. Chairman Mao knew that Elder Statesman 伏老 was leaving this morning to visit Indonesia and came to see him off. Chairman Mao asked Elder Statesman 伏老 how he had slept and if he had rested well. Elder Statesman 伏老 said, "Very well. I feel a bit bad about disturbing you so late. You should have rested earlier." Chairman Mao said, "I should come and see you." It only takes half a minute to walk from here to the reception room. In that half minute, Elder Statesman 伏老 wanted to hold Chairman Mao's hand and walk, and also wanted to hold his arm. Their close feelings were difficult to express in words. At the entrance to the reception room, the two chairmen politely yielded to each other. Elder Statesman 伏老 said, "You are a guest here, please go first." Chairman Mao smiled and said to Elder Statesman 伏老, "Let's go in together!"

The room was furnished with purple-red sofas, with three small tea tables in the middle. The bookcase against the right wall was filled with books that Chairman Mao had read. Large pots of plum blossoms were placed in the four corners of the room. Everything in the room made people feel simple and unique. Chairman Mao and Elder Statesman 伏老 sat down. Elder Statesman 伏老 knew that Chairman Mao was a smoker. He got up from the tea table, took the ashtray, and placed it on the armrest of the sofa, saying to Chairman Mao, "This will be more convenient for you. You don't have to get up to tap the ashes, as the tea table is a bit far from you." The old man himself was going to move the tea table closer, but Chairman Mao repeatedly said, "No need, no need, I can reach it." Elder Statesman 伏老 seemed a little doubtful and asked, "Really? Don't be polite!"

Chairman Mao, without bothering to smoke, said to Elder Statesman 伏老, "Have you been tired these past twenty days? The schedule might have been a bit tight. Have you not rested well?" While speaking, Chairman Mao held Elder Statesman 伏老's hand, his voice warm and sincere, as if talking to a brother at home. Elder Statesman 伏老 gently patted Chairman Mao's hand and said excitedly, "My dearest friend, Comrade Mao Zedong, I am not tired at all, everything is excellent. Occasionally, I felt a little dizzy from the sun. I ate some snake meat in Guangzhou, maybe there was a 'dragon-tiger fight' unfolding in my stomach. When I returned to Beijing, I felt slightly uncomfortable, but it quickly passed. Whenever I think of the moving welcome and hospitality of the warm and hospitable Chinese people towards us, even a little fatigue is forgotten."

Chairman Mao asked again about Elder Statesman 伏老's health, and said that he still had to make a long flight and that if he did not rest well, it would increase his fatigue. Elder Statesman 伏老 did not continue on this topic. He held Chairman Mao's hand even tighter and said with great concern, "I heard that you stay up late every day. My heart truly aches! You must not stay up late. I used to work through the night, and as a result, my body suffered a lot. I hope you do this: when the sun rises, you greet it, and when the sun sets, you bid it farewell and go to rest." Chairman Mao smiled and said, "Okay, I will follow the sun's schedule." He added, "It's okay, I'm already used to working at night..." Elder Statesman 伏老 shook his head and said, "No, no, you can't do that!" Neither chairman convinced the other, and the topic turned to smoking. Elder Statesman 伏老 asked Chairman Mao how many cigarettes he smoked each day. Chairman Mao said, "Not many. Sometimes I hold the cigarette in my hand without smoking it, or I light it but don't smoke it, just watching it smoke. It feels like I've smoked in spirit." Elder Statesman 伏老 shook his head again, clearly not fully agreeing, but he couldn't find a better reason to persuade him at the moment. At this time, the two old men's eyes met in a straight line, and they couldn't help but laugh. Elder Statesman 伏老 seemed to have remembered something. He first gave Chairman Mao a cup of Longjing tea, then said, "My dear Comrade Mao Zedong, if you want to rest, you can go to our place anytime. You can go wherever you want, such as Sochi in Southern Russia and Crimea on the Black Sea coast..." The old man described these natural environments so vividly, as if he were already standing on the Black Sea coast and in the Sochi resort, the silver waves rolling, the birds singing leisurely, the forests, the springs, the happy and joyful scenes of the lives of workers, farmers, and intellectuals who were working and resting were all presented before your eyes. Chairman Mao said to Elder Statesman 伏老, "I deeply thank you, you have very good intentions..." He was about to say more when Comrades Shaoqi and Enlai entered.

The time to depart was approaching. The silver wings of the Tu-104 airliner were already prepared to break through the 10,000-meter altitude, sending this 76-year-old outstanding peace fighter to Indonesia to meet the long-awaited Indonesian people.

Chairman Mao accompanied Elder Statesman 伏老 out. The two chairmen walked in unison, as if one person was walking. The car door was opened, and the waist support that Elder Statesman 伏老 always liked to sit on was also raised, but the two great hands were still tightly clasped together. On these two hands was displayed the strength of all peace-loving people in the world, and on these two hands shone the light of happiness for all mankind.

As the car was about to drive to the airport, Chairman Mao said to Elder Statesman 伏老, "I will not say goodbye to you, I will only say goodbye temporarily. I wish you a safe journey!"

    毛主席深夜送别伏老
    李越然
    夜深了，天空中的星辰露出了一些倦意，世界上有多少人在甜睡着。……
    清晨三点二十五分，伏老就来到了寓所的前厅里。他身着灰色西服，银丝般的白发梳得整整齐齐的。老人家先向两旁的几位同志问了早安，随即把手放在衣兜里，站了一会儿，向前走了两步，他没有说什么，只是微笑着。两分钟过去了……前厅里十分静寂，大家都听到了外面传来的脚步声。先进来的一位同志对伏老说：“来了！”老人家好像在等待最亲近的人，又向前走了两步，右手还摸了摸领带。毛主席很快就进来了。我们最敬爱的两位主席的手紧紧地握在一起了。毛主席知道伏老今晨动身去印度尼西亚访问，特来看看他。毛主席问伏老觉睡得怎么样，休息好了没有。伏老说：“很好，这么晚了还打搅你，真有些过意不去，你早应该休息了。”毛主席说：“我应该来看看你。”从这儿走到会客室只要半分钟，就在这半分钟内，伏老又想同毛主席拉着手走，又想挽着臂走，他们亲近的心情是很难用言语来表达的。走到会客室门前，两位主席互相谦让。伏老说：“你到我这里来是客人，请你先走。”毛主席笑着对伏老说：“咱俩一块儿进去吧！”
    屋里陈设着紫红色沙发，中间有三张小茶桌，靠右墙的书柜里摆着毛主席曾看过的书籍，屋内四个角上摆着大盆梅花。屋内的一切使人感到朴素别致。毛主席和伏老坐下来。伏老知道毛主席是吸烟的人，他起来从茶桌上把烟碟拿给毛主席，放在沙发的靠手上，对毛主席说：“这样你就方便了，不用再起来去搕烟灰，茶桌离你远了一些。”老人家自己要去把茶桌往近处搬一搬，毛主席连说：“不用，不用，我能够得着。”伏老好像有些怀疑，问道：“真的吗？你不要客气呵！”
    毛主席没有顾得吸烟，对伏老说：“二十天来你累了吧？节目可能紧了一些，你是不是没有休息好。”说话时，毛主席握着伏老的手，他的声音亲切诚挚，像在自己家里同兄弟谈话一样。伏老轻轻地拍着毛主席的手兴奋地说：“我最亲近的朋友，毛泽东同志，我一点也没累，一切都好极了。偶尔由于太阳晒有些头昏，在广州吃了点蛇肉，也许肚子里展开了龙虎斗，刚回北京稍稍感到不舒适，很快就过去了。每当我想到热情好客的中国人民对我们的动人的欢迎和款待，就是有点疲劳也都忘了。”
    毛主席又问伏老的健康，并且说，还要作长途飞行，如果休息得不好会增加疲劳。伏老没有就这个题目谈下去。他把毛主席的手握得更紧了，很关心地说：“我听说你每天熬夜，我真心痛啊！你无论如何也别熬夜了。过去我也曾通宵地工作，结果身体受了不少损失。希望你这样做：太阳一出来你就向它问好，太阳一落你就向它告别，去休息。”毛主席笑着说：“好，要按太阳的规律办事。”又说：“不要紧，我已经习惯了夜里工作……。”伏老摇摇头说：“不行不行，你不能这样做！”两位主席谁也没有说服谁，话题转到吸烟问题上去了。伏老问毛主席每天吸几支烟，毛主席说：“不多，有时把烟拿在手里不抽，或者是燃着了不吸，看着它冒烟，在精神上也好像是吸了。”伏老又是摇头，显然是不完全赞同，可是一时又找不出更好的理由来说服。这时两位老人家的目光连成了一条直线，不由地都笑起来了。伏老好像想起了什么事情，先把一杯龙井茶拿给毛主席，随即说：“我亲爱的毛泽东同志，你如果想休息，随时都可以到我们那儿去，你想到哪儿就到哪儿，如像南俄的索奇和黑海岸上的克里米亚等地……。”老人家把这些自然环境描述得那样动人，真好像他已站在黑海边上和置身于索奇的休养所里，那银浪滚滚的海水，那悠然歌唱的鸟儿，那森林，那泉水，那劳动着和休息着的工人、农民、知识分子生活的幸福和愉快的情景，都一一地呈现在你的眼前。毛主席对伏老说：“我深深地感谢你，你这是很好的意思……”正要再说下去，少奇同志和恩来同志进来了。
    动身的时刻快到了。图—104客机的银翼早已准备好了威力去冲破一万公尺的高空，把这位七十六高龄的卓越的和平战士送到印度尼西亚去，同等候已久的印度尼西亚人民见面。
    毛主席陪同伏老走出来，两位主席的步伐一致，好像一个人走路。汽车门打开了，伏老一向喜欢坐的腰座也拉起来了，可是两只伟大的手还是紧紧地握在一起。在这两只手上显示出全世界一切爱好和平人们的力量，在这两只手上闪耀出全人类幸福的光芒。
    在汽车就要开往机场的时候，毛主席对伏老说：“我不同你告别，我只暂时同你说再见。祝你一路平安！”
