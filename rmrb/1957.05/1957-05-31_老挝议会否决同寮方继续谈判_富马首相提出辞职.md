    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: Vientiane dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma submitted his resignation today after the National Assembly refused to hold a vote of confidence in him.

    The Lao National Assembly continued its heated debate on the issue of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units on the 29th. According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio, a motion on whether the National Assembly approved of continuing negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units based on the government's report was rejected in a vote with thirteen votes against and eleven votes in favor. This vote was conducted in secret.

    Two other motions were voted on publicly at the meeting on the 29th. The results of the vote indicated that the National Assembly approved of the various agreements and joint statements already signed by the Royal Government and the Lao side; however, the National Assembly did not believe that the implementation of these agreements and joint statements had been effective.

    A total of thirty-six deputies attended the meeting on the 29th, and three were absent. When voting, the twelve deputies holding government positions did not vote, so the actual number of voters was twenty-four.

    A prominent event at the National Assembly on the 29th was the fierce criticism of Deputy Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith by Vientiane Deputy and former National Assembly Chairman Phoui Sananikone. Sananikone accused Sasorith of opposing the efforts made by the Royal Government to resolve the Lao issue. He said that under these circumstances, Sasorith was no longer standing on the government's side.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: Vientiane dispatch: According to a recent report in the Lao "Peace" Weekly, Phoui Sananikone, Chairman of the Lao Committee for Upholding Peace and Neutrality, spoke at a grand rally of more than 5,000 people in Vientiane on the 20th, calling on the people of all strata in Laos to actively support the Phouma government, so that the implementation of the policy of peace and neutrality and negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units can achieve good results.

    Phoui Sananikone repeatedly emphasized the correctness and importance of the policy of peace and neutrality. He said that implementing this policy would save Laos from the scourge of war and bring great benefits to the people.

    老挝议会否决同寮方继续谈判
    富马首相提出辞职
    据新华社河内30日电　万象消息：老挝首相富马亲王在国民议会拒绝对他进行信任投票之后，今天提出辞职。
    老挝国民议会在29日继续对寮国战斗部队的问题进行了激烈的辩论。据万象电台广播，一项关于国民议会是否赞成依照政府的报告继续同寮国战斗部队进行谈判的动议，在表决中以十三票反对、十一票赞成遭到否决。这一项表决是秘密进行的。
    29日的会议上还对另外两个动议进行了公开投票，表决的结果表明国民议会赞成王国政府和寮国方面已经签订的各项协议和联合声明；但是，国民议会并不认为双方执行这些协议和联合声明已经获得成效。
    出席29日会议的议员共三十六人，三人缺席。表决的时候，十二名兼政府职务的议员不投票，因此实际投票人数是二十四人。
    29日国民议会上突出的事件是万象的议员、前国民大会主席彭·苏发那冯猛烈抨击副首相萨索里特。苏发那冯指责萨索里特反对王国政府在解决寮国问题方面所作的努力。他说，在这种情况下，萨索里特已经不再站在政府的立场。
    据新华社河内30日电　万象消息：据老挝“和平”周刊最近报道，老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会主席彭·苏发那冯20日在万象五千多群众的盛大集会上讲话，号召老挝各阶层人民积极拥护富马政府，使和平中立政策的执行以及同寮国战斗部队的谈判取得良好结果。
    彭·苏发那冯一再强调和平中立政策的正确和重要。他说，执行这种政策将使老挝免遭战祸，给人民带来很大的利益。
