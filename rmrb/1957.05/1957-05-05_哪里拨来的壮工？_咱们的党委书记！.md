    "Where did these strong laborers come from?" "Our Party Committee Secretary!"
    (By our newspaper) This newspaper reports: Fifteen leading cadres from the Tianjin Municipal Construction Committee, the Bureau of Construction Engineering, and the Construction Trade Union went to construction sites separately on the 3rd to sieve soil, carry bricks, and mix cement together with the workers.
    On the afternoon of the 3rd, Hu Yukun, Deputy Secretary of the Construction Party Committee, and Ren Boyu, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Third Construction Engineering Company, went to the construction site of the Ministry of Railways school of the Third Construction Engineering Company, and silently dug and carried soil alongside the workers. At first, some workers thought that the work zone leaders had transferred in some strong laborers. Worker Lin Shusen asked the old worker Liu San: "Where did these people come from?" Liu San said with a smile: "Isn't that the secretary of our Construction Party Committee?! He's here to help us work!" When the workers heard that there were leading cadres working on the construction site, they felt it was a very meaningful thing, and their work enthusiasm soared. In the past, the workers in Wang Dianyi's group only filled the core soil for six rooms a day, but in less than two hours one afternoon, they filled three rooms, completing the work that used to take half a day. During breaks, the leading cadres took the initiative to chat with the workers, and the workers also freely reflected some problems and opinions about the labor quotas and competitions. They explained some of the problems to the workers, and wrote down some of the problems and opinions. Hu Yukun said: I hope everyone will provide more feedback. In the future, the leaders will actively rely on everyone to overcome difficulties in their work.

    “哪里拨来的壮工？”“咱们的党委书记！”
    本报讯：中共天津市建设委员会、建筑工程局和建筑工会的十五名领导干部，在3日分头到建筑工地去，和工人一起筛土、搬砖、打水泥。
    3日下午，建设党委副书记胡玉坤和第三建筑工程公司党委书记任伯余等到第三建筑工程公司铁道部学校工地，不声不响地和工人一同挖土、抬土。起初，有些工人还以为是工区领导上给调来了几名壮工。工人林树森问老工人刘三：“这些人是哪儿拨来的？”刘三笑着说：“这不是咱们建设党委的书记?！帮咱一起干活来啦！”工人们听说有领导干部在工地上干活，觉得是件很有意义的事，工作情绪高涨起来。过去，王殿义领导的小组工人一天只填六间房子的房心土，一天下午不到两个小时就填了三间，干了过去需要半天才做完的活。在休息的时候，领导干部主动地和工人们谈天，工人们也无拘无束地向他们反映了劳动定额和竞赛中的一些问题和意见。有一些问题，他们对工人们作了解释；有些问题和意见记了下来。胡玉坤表示：希望大家多反映意见，今后领导还要积极地依靠大家克服工作中的困难。
