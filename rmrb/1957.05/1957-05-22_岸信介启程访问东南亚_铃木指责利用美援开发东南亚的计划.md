Xinhua News Agency Report: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi departed from Tokyo's Haneda Airport on the evening of May 20th to visit Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thailand, and Taiwan. Before his departure, Kishi stated that the purpose of his visit was to further enhance the friendly and amicable relations between Japan and these countries.

The Japanese cabinet meeting that day had already appointed State Minister Mitsujiro Ishii as Deputy Prime Minister to act as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister during Kishi's absence.

Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, commenting on Kishi's visit to Southeast Asia, pointed out that the Japanese government's policy of using American funds and Japanese technology to develop the economy of Southeast Asia would "isolate Japan in Asia" because many countries in Asia do not welcome American "aid." He also pointed out that if Kishi wants the United States to invest in Southeast Asia, he will find himself to be "quite ignorant" of reality.

According to a London dispatch: The British magazine "The Economist" said that Kishi's visit to Southeast Asia was to seek "Asian goodwill" and to restore the "face" Japan lost in Asia due to its defeat in the war. "The Economist" pointed out that Japan's desire to play a leading role in the "non-Communist Asian region" with the support of the United States is not something that other Asians can easily accept.

    岸信介启程访问东南亚
    铃木指责利用美援开发东南亚的计划
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本首相岸信介5月20日晚上从东京羽田机场动身，到缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、泰国和台湾进行访问。岸信介在行前发表声明说，他这次访问的目的，是希望进一步增进日本同这些国家的友好亲善关系。
    日本内阁会议当天已经指定国务相石井光次郎为副首相，在岸信介出国期间代行首相和外务相的职务。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在评论岸信介到东南亚访问时指出，日本政府主张用美国的资金和日本的技术来发展东南亚的经济的政策将“使日本在亚洲孤立”，因为亚洲有许多国家不欢迎美国的“援助”。他并且指出，如果岸信介想让美国投资于东南亚，那么他自己就会发现他对现实是“十分无知的”。
    另据伦敦消息：英国“经济学家”杂志说，岸信介访问东南亚是为了寻找“亚洲的好感”，并且恢复日本因为战败而在亚洲丧失了的“面子”。“经济学家”指出，日本想在美国支持下在“非共产党亚洲地区”起领导作用的愿望，并不是能够很容易就让其他亚洲人接受的东西。
