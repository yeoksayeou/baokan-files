    Matters Requiring Attention in Current Agricultural Production
    Listen to the Opinions of the Masses and Do a Good Job in Wheat Harvesting
    Yesterday was already "Xiaoman" (Grain Full). In most winter wheat producing areas, the winter wheat grown through hard work will be harvested after this solar term.
    China's winter wheat area is 370 million mu, which accounts for almost one-quarter of China's cultivated land area. The total output of winter wheat in China is more than 50 billion jin. All these indicate that wheat is an important agricultural resource for us, and it is a very important thing to harvest this crop well.
    This matter was not handled well in some areas last year. In Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces alone, about 4.5 billion jin of wheat were lost. Last year, the rainy season came earlier, and most of the newly established agricultural cooperatives lacked collective production experience. This is part of the reason for the large loss of wheat last year. The subjective and bureaucratic work styles of the cadres leading agricultural production also brought great harm to last year's wheat harvest. Last year, some agricultural cooperative cadres in southern Shanxi Province, disregarding the actual situation, emphasized centralized harvesting and did not allow the early cutting of wheat that had already matured, or they did not allow threshing on small fields, but insisted on threshing in large fields. The three production teams of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County lost 27,900 jin of wheat because they did not accept the opinions of the masses and use small fields rationally. An agricultural cooperative in Taotang Township, Linyi County, suffered 80% of its wheat ruined due to the constraint of the cadres' "cut it all down and transport it all together."
    Remembering the lessons of last year well is the only way to improve this year's wheat harvest work. Many areas in Shaanxi Province have studied the shortcomings of last year's wheat harvest and deployed this year's wheat harvest work before the wheat harvest. Weinan County's summer harvest work this year is not only prepared early, but also carefully organized the labor force and formulated new leadership methods. In order to welcome the wheat harvest, the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Yanliang Township, Lintong County, prepared 15 wheat threshing fields and hired experienced farmers as consultants for wheat threshing. The wheat is about to ripen, and all wheat-producing areas should immediately prepare for this year's wheat harvest.
    Many areas have a larger wheat harvest area this year than last year, but many areas have less and weaker livestock this year than last year, and there is still a possibility of abnormal weather this year. The comrades who lead the wheat harvest work should pay attention to these new situations while remembering the lessons of last year.
    In the year since last year's wheat harvest, there have been many improvements in the leadership of agricultural production; however, it is still very necessary to prevent subjectivism and bureaucracy in the leadership of wheat harvest work. The most effective prescription for preventing these problems is to go deep into the production process and listen to the opinions of the masses.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    倾听群众意见，做好麦收工作
    昨天已是“小满”。在大部分冬小麦产区，经过辛勤劳动长成的冬小麦，要在这个节令以后收割。
    我国冬小麦的面积有三亿七千万亩，几乎占到我国耕地面积的四分之一。我国冬小麦的总产量在五百亿斤以上。这些都说明：小麦是我们的重要农业资源，收好这项作物是一项十分重要的事情。
    这件事情，去年有些地区是作得不好的。仅安徽、河南、江苏、陕西四省，就损失小麦四十五亿斤左右。去年雨季来得早些，绝大部分新建的农业社又缺乏集体生产的经验，这是去年损失大量小麦的一部分原因；领导农业生产的干部的主观主义和官僚主义作风，也给去年麦收带来很大的危害。去年山西晋南一些农业社的干部不看实际情况，强调集中收获，不让先割已经成熟了的小麦；或是不准在小场上随收随碾，非集中在大场上脱粒不行。洪赵县常丰农业社的三个生产队，因为没有接受群众意见，合理地使用小场，损失了小麦二万七千九百斤。临猗县陶唐乡一个农业社，就由于受了干部的“一齐割倒一齐运”的约束，使社的麦子霉坏了80％。
    很好地记取去年的教训，才能改进今年的麦收工作。陕西省不少地区已在麦收以前研究了去年麦收的缺点，部署了今年的麦收工作。渭南县今年的夏收工作不但准备的早，而且认真组织了劳动力，订出了新的领导方法。临潼县阎良乡胜利农业社，为了迎接麦收，准备了十五个打麦的场，聘请了老农当打麦的参谋长。麦子眼看就要熟了，各产麦地区都应该立即为今年的麦收工作做好准备。
    不少地区今年的收麦面积比去年大，可是，不少地区今年的畜力比去年少而弱，今年的气象还有不正常的可能。领导麦收工作的同志，在记取去年教训的同时，还要注意到这些新的情况。
    去年麦收以来的一年中，农业生产的领导工作有不少改进；但是，在领导麦收工作中，防范主观主义、官僚主义依然是很必要的。防范这些毛病的最有效的药方，还是深入到生产过程中去，倾听群众意见。
