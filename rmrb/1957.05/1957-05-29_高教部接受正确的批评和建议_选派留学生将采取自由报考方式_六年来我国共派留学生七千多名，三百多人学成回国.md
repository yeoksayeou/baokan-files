Xinhua News Agency, May 28th. With the approval of the State Council, the Ministry of Higher Education's work on selecting students to study abroad will, starting this year, adopt a method of announcing majors and allowing free application.

The target applicants for studying abroad are cadres with more than two years of practical work experience after graduating from university. The Ministry of Higher Education will announce the majors for application at that time, allowing applicants to choose freely. This differs from the previous method of assigning selection by major proportion in key schools, and it can select the most outstanding talents to study abroad on a broader national scale.

In the future, the Ministry of Higher Education will send students abroad, ensuring quality as a prerequisite, and fully consider the educational strengths and possible conditions of the Soviet Union and other countries, as well as China's actual needs, to achieve careful selection, fewer but better. In addition to professional level and practical work ability, applicants are also required to have a foreign language proficiency that enables them to understand lectures, read professional books, and express basic meanings in conversation.

Starting this year, the Ministry of Higher Education has decided to no longer send high school graduates to study abroad, because the educational reform of domestic universities has been basically completed, and general university students can be trained domestically. Sending students abroad will mainly focus on training scientific research cadres. In the past few years, due to lack of experience, the majors of students sent abroad generally favored current needs more and long-term needs less, resulting in some majors being too concentrated and some key majors being sent too few or not at all. In order to overcome this blindness and adapt to the requirements of the country's scientific research work, preparations are being made to establish a special team for sending students abroad, under the leadership of the Science Planning Commission, with the participation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Higher Education and other departments, to be responsible for determining the long-term and annual plans for sending students abroad. This year, necessary professional adjustments will be made for university students (mainly first and second year students) who are currently studying abroad. University students in general majors that can be trained domestically should be changed to majors that are lacking or weak domestically as much as possible.

Recently, many teachers and students in universities have criticized the selection of students studying abroad. They believe that the selection of students in the past showed a bias towards politics and neglecting professional skills, the quality of students was not high, and did not meet the requirements for studying abroad. For example, students' basic knowledge and professional knowledge levels were not high, and their language proficiency could not meet the requirements for studying abroad; most postgraduate students lacked practical work experience and had poor independent research abilities. Therefore, after research, the Ministry of Higher Education decided to adopt the above-mentioned improvement measures.

From the start of sending students abroad in 1950 to 1956, China had sent 7,075 students to fourteen countries. Among them, 1,331 were postgraduate students and 5,744 were university students. By November 1956, 354 students had graduated and returned to China. Among the graduate students who graduated from the Soviet Union, two obtained doctoral degrees and one hundred and eleven obtained associate doctoral degrees. They have all been assigned to work in factories, schools, scientific research and other units according to national needs, and some have also assumed leadership positions.

### 高教部接受正确的批评和建议  选派留学生将采取自由报考方式  六年来我国共派留学生七千多名，三百多人学成回国

    高教部接受正确的批评和建议
    选派留学生将采取自由报考方式
    六年来我国共派留学生七千多名，三百多人学成回国
    新华社28日讯　高等教育部选派出国留学生的工作，经国务院同意，从今年起将采取公布专业、自由报考的方式。
    招考留学生的对象是大学毕业后具有两年以上实际工作经验的干部。高等教育部到时候将公布招考的专业，由报考学生自由选择。这和往年所采取的按专业比例在重点学校布置选拔的办法不同，它可以更广泛地在全国范围内选拔出最优秀的人出国留学。
      高等教育部今后派遣留学生，将在保证质量的前提下，充分考虑苏联和其他各国的教育特长和可能条件，我国的实际需要，做到慎重选择，少而精。对应考的学生，除了业务水平和实际工作能力以外，还要求有关外国语达到能听课、能读专业书籍和会话能表达基本意思的水平。
      从今年起，高等教育部决定不再选派高中毕业生出国留学。因为国内高等学校教育改革已经基本完成，一般大学生可以在国内培养。派遣留学生以培养科学研究干部为主。过去几年由于缺乏经验，派遣留学生的专业一般照顾当前需要多，照顾长远需要不够，因而造成有些专业过于集中，有些重点专业派得过少或者没有派。为了克服这种盲目性，适应国家开展科学研究工作的要求，准备在科学规划委员会的领导下，成立由中国科学院、国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、高等教育部等部门参加的派遣留学生专门小组，负责确定派遣留学生的长远计划和年度计划。今年，对于正在国外学习的大学生（主要是一、二年级）将进行必要的专业调整。凡是国内能培养的、一般专业的大学生，尽可能改学国内的缺门或薄弱的专业。
    对于出国留学生的选派工作，近来有很多高等学校的师生提出了批评。他们认为，过去留学生的选拔工作表现出重政治、轻业务的偏向，留学生质量不高，不符合在国外学习的要求。如留学生的基础知识和专业知识水平不高，语文水平也不能适应出国学习的要求；留学研究生大多缺乏实际工作经验，独立研究的能力较差。因此，高等教育部经过研究，决定采取上述改进办法。
    从1950年开始派遣留学生到1956年，我国留学生所到的国家有十四个，共七千零七十五名。其中研究生一千三百三十一名，大学生五千七百四十四名。到1956年11月止，已经毕业回国的留学生有三百五十四人。留苏毕业研究生中有两人获得博士学位，一百十一人获得副博士学位。他们都根据国家需要分配到工厂、学校和科学研究等单位工作，有的还担任了领导职务。
