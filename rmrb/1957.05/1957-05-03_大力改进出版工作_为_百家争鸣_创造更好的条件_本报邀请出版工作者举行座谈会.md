    This Newspaper Invites Publishing Workers to Hold a Symposium
    (Our newspaper) News: In order to improve publishing and distribution work and implement the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom," this newspaper recently invited responsible comrades from the People's Publishing House, Science Publishing House, Workers' Publishing House, China Youth Publishing House, World Knowledge Publishing House, Commercial Press, Popular Reading Publishing House, and relevant主管机关 (supervisory authorities) to hold a symposium. At the meeting, everyone put forward many opinions on this issue and had a lively discussion.

    Take Various Measures to Expand the Garden of Contention

    Everyone unanimously agreed that publications are the main garden for "contention." In the future, the publishing industry must further implement the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" and open the doors of publishing houses. We must "let it go," "let it go big," and everyone agreed on this. Moreover, in order to create better conditions for contention, many publishing houses have already taken and will take some new measures. Zhao Zhongchi, Deputy Director of the Science Publishing House, said: Academic journals are the most suitable ground for contention. The Science Publishing House has added as many as twelve new journals in the past nine months. Of the forty journals originally published last year, eighteen have officially decided to expand their size, and fifteen have increased their frequency. However, at present, there are still many scientific departments that do not have journals, and some journals should be published by branches of science due to the development of various branches of science, which requires scientists to work together to create new journals. At present, some publishing houses are unwilling to publish journals, and some printing factories are unwilling to undertake printing journals, and this situation must be changed. In addition to publishing journals, the Science Publishing House has also relaxed the scope of soliciting contributions and expanded the scope of publication, and has organized some manuscripts with various viewpoints, some of which have been published or are about to be published. In addition, in terms of translating foreign masterpieces and providing research materials, the Science Publishing House's initial draft of topics on basic sciences of natural sciences has begun, and the organization of translation has begun.

    Guo Jing, Deputy Director of the Commercial Press, said: In order to implement the policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, the Commercial Press has decided to do more work for universities and academic circles. In the past, some university lecture notes with different opinions have been published, and will continue to be published in the future, and internal distribution will be changed to public distribution. Recently, a working group was also sent to various universities to solicit opinions on the lecture notes and to understand the works that can be published by the universities. Now, many manuscripts have been received and are planned to be included in next year's publishing plan. Letters have also been sent to authors who have published works. Now, some have revised their old works, and some have sent new manuscripts.

    Liang Chunfu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the World Knowledge Publishing House, said: International issues involve foreign policy, and some are not suitable for contention. However, the World Knowledge Publishing House will also further open up. In the past, the World Knowledge Semi-Monthly has carried out some discussions, which were very popular with readers, and will continue in the future. The World Knowledge Publishing House will also publish more books from capitalist countries with valuable information.

    Many comrades also felt that there are still some difficulties in implementing this policy.

    Master the Review Standards, Create Fellow Publications

    Many comrades believe that this policy is difficult to grasp. Gu Junzheng, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the China Youth Publishing House, said: As soon as contention is launched, there will be more manuscripts, which requires a standard for selection. For example, for the issue of historical periodization, books from various schools of thought can be published, but "poisonous weeds" should not be published too much. It is said that as long as the arguments are reasonable, they can be published, but this is also relatively abstract. At the same time, if too many books are published, manpower and material resources will become a problem first. Gu Junzheng also said: In order to solve this difficulty, many people have suggested running fellow publications and publishing companies in the past. These methods can also be considered.

    Regarding the issue of whether international issues can be contended, Liang Chunfu said that it is generally believed that academic issues can be contended, but whether policy issues can be contended needs to be studied. The World Knowledge Publishing House has published a book by Chen Hansheng, "American Monopoly Capital," in which some of the arguments are new, and it has also been published, which is contention. However, at present, there are too few academic manuscripts on international issues, and academic circles need to work together to provide more.

    Regarding the issue of whether contention can be carried out in popular reading materials, Lan Yu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Popular Reading Publishing House, said: There are some restrictions on contention in popular reading materials, but there is also flexibility. Within a certain range, contention is also possible, such as introducing some issues in contention. However, criticism must be made when introducing them.

    Eliminate Dogmatism, Determine Editorial Responsibility

    Dogmatism is an important obstacle to implementing the policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, which involves the issue of editorial responsibility. Gu Junzheng said: In the past, it was not clear what responsibilities editors should bear for manuscripts. Readers have high requirements for books, and many book reviews criticize books with dogmatism. In this way, in order to avoid being criticized harshly, editors have to review manuscripts according to dogmatism, so a large number of dogmatic books have come out. In the future, the issue of editorial responsibility must be resolved. Academic views are best the responsibility of the author, the editor can be partially responsible for the writing, and the editor should not be responsible for quotations, etc. Liang Chunfu also said: The dogmatic atmosphere in society has affected the editorial work, and the dogmatism in editorial work has affected the social atmosphere. In the past, the dogmatism in editorial work was serious. For example, Li Chunqing wrote a book "An Overview of the Japanese Question," and some editors gave him a lot of opinions based on a few pamphlets, which made the author feel difficult. This is a dogmatic method of reviewing manuscripts.

    In response to the current situation of shortage and abuse of publications, Zeng Yanxiu, Deputy Director of the People's Publishing House, said: The situation of shortage and abuse of publications is serious. In addition, there is also "slow." For example, the publishing work lacks an overall policy, and dogmatism has existed for a long time. Publishing houses regard publishing books as a technical problem and pursue publishing indicators. Editors only pay attention to checking quotations and other trivial issues, and do not pay attention to the content of manuscripts. Therefore, the quality of many books is not high, they are all generalities, and they have a strong dogmatic flavor. Book reviews play a great role in publishing work. However, many book reviews are very superficial, bland, and rarely talk about academic issues. In the future, the responsibilities of publishing houses must be clarified, and they can be less responsible for writing quotations and other aspects, and pay more attention to the overall aspects such as organizing manuscripts.

    Publishing Needs to Be Serious, Writing Needs to Be Careful

    Some comrades also put forward opinions on the publishing industry's atmosphere and made requests to the writing community. Zeng Yanxiu said that the current publishing of books is too casual, and this atmosphere is not good. Many authors are unwilling to painstakingly write valuable academic papers, but instead piece together books. An article that has just been published in a magazine will be submitted to the publishing house for publication in a few days. This situation is particularly serious in Shanghai. This is actually a waste of paper and encourages authors to produce rough and shoddy works. Moreover, the publication of translations is not serious. Too many dogmatic translations without academic value have been published, and the Shanghai People's Publishing House has a big shortcoming in this regard. It is hoped that the publishing industry will not advocate superficiality in the future, and the writing and translation communities should also pay attention to improving quality.

    Solve Institutional Problems, Improve the Royalty System

    Some comrades also specifically raised the issue of the publishing industry's system and criticized the leading organs. Zeng Yanxiu said that the system issue is related to the editing, printing, and distribution systems. At present, there is a lot of confusion in these aspects, and the leading organs have not considered it for a long time, which is a manifestation of bureaucratism. Lan Yu and Wu Congyun, Deputy Director of the Workers' Publishing House, basically agreed with this view, believing that it would be difficult to implement Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom if this issue is not considered. They hoped that the leaders would quickly convene a meeting to discuss it.

    Regarding the issue of insufficient paper, many comrades believed that this issue is serious, but it can be appropriately resolved as long as it is well regulated. Guo Jing said that some publishing houses currently feel that there is not enough paper, while some books are heavily stockpiled, and it should be distributed more rationally in the future.

    In addition, some comrades believe that the current royalties are too high (especially for some newspapers and periodicals), and they are very inconsistent, which is also a problem worth studying.

### 大力改进出版工作  为“百家争鸣”创造更好的条件  本报邀请出版工作者举行座谈会

    大力改进出版工作
    为“百家争鸣”创造更好的条件
    本报邀请出版工作者举行座谈会
    本报讯  为了改进出版发行工作，贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，本报最近邀请人民出版社、科学出版社、工人出版社、中国青年出版社、世界知识出版社、商务印书馆、通俗读物出版社和有关主管机关的负责同志举行座谈会。会上，大家就这个问题提出了许多意见，并进行了热烈的讨论。
    采取各种措施，扩大争鸣园地
    大家一致认为，出版物是“争鸣”的主要园地。今后，出版界必须进一步贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，敞开出版社的大门。要放，要大放，这是大家都没有异议的。并且，为使争鸣有更好的条件，许多出版社都已经和将要采取一些新的措施。科学出版社副社长赵仲池说：学术期刊是争鸣的最适宜的地盘，科学出版社在最近九个月内就增出了十二种之多，去年原已出刊的四十种中也有十八种正式决定扩充篇幅，十五种增加刊期。但是，目前还有许多科学部门没有期刊，有的期刊由于本科学部门各分支学科的发展也应以分支学科出刊，这就需要科学家们共同努力，创办新的期刊。目前，有些出版社不愿出版期刊，有些印刷厂不愿承印期刊，这种情况要加以改变。除出版期刊外，科学出版社还放宽了采稿面，扩大了出版范围，并已组织到了一些各种见解的书稿，有的已经出版或即将出版。此外，在翻译外国名著、提供研究资料方面，科学出版社关于自然科学的基础科学的选题初稿已经着手草拟，并已开始组织翻译。
    商务印书馆副社长郭敬说：为了贯彻百家争鸣的方针，商务印书馆决定为高等学校和学术界多做一些工作。过去已出版了一些有不同见解的大学讲义，今后还要继续出版，并把内部发行改为公开发行。最近，还派了一个工作组到各大学征求对讲义的意见，并了解各大学可以出版的著作。现在，已收到不少书稿，打算订入明年出版计划。对于出过著作的作者，也已去信联系。现在，有的已对旧作作了修改，有的还寄来了新的书稿。
    世界知识出版社副总编辑梁纯夫说：国际问题涉及外交政策，有的不便争鸣。但是，世界知识出版社也要进一步开放。过去世界知识半月刊开展过一些讨论，很受读者欢迎，今后还要继续下去。世界知识出版社还要多出一些资本主义国家的有资料价值的书籍。
    许多同志在贯彻这一方针时，也都感到还有一些困难。
    掌握审稿标准，创办同人刊物
    许多同志认为这个方针不好掌握。中国青年出版社副总编辑顾均正说：争鸣一开展，书稿就多了，这就需要有个取舍标准。比如历史分期问题，各个学派的书籍都可出，但是“毒草”就不能出得过多。说是争鸣只要言之成理，但是这也比较抽象。同时，要是书籍出得太多，人力物力首先就成问题。顾均正还说：为了解决这个困难，过去不少人提议办同人刊物，办出版公司。这些办法也可以考虑。
    关于国际问题是不是可以争鸣的问题，梁纯夫说，一般认为学术问题可以争鸣，而政策问题可否争鸣却需要研究。世界知识出版社出版过一本陈翰笙的“美国垄断资本”，其中有些论点较新，也出版了，这就是争鸣。不过，目前国际问题的学术性书稿太少，需要学术界共同努力，多多供给。
    关于在通俗读物中是不是可以争鸣的问题，通俗读物出版社副总编辑蓝钰说：在通俗读物中争鸣有些限制，但是也有弹性。在一定范围内，争鸣也是可以的，比如介绍一些争鸣中的问题。不过，介绍时一定要作批判。
    清除教条主义，确定编辑责任
    教条主义是贯彻百家争鸣方针的一个重要障碍，这就牵涉到编辑责任的问题。顾均正说：过去，编辑对书稿应负哪些责任一直不够明确。读者对书籍的要求很高，许多书评又以教条主义批评书籍，这样，编辑为了避免受到苛责，就只得按教条主义审稿，于是教条主义的书也就大量出来了。今后，编辑的责任问题必须解决。学术观点最好由著作人负责，文字方面可由编辑负一部分责任，至于引文等等也不应由编辑负责。梁纯夫也说：社会上的教条主义风气影响了编辑工作，编辑工作中的教条主义又影响了社会风气。过去，编辑工作中的教条主义是严重的。比如，李纯青写了一本“日本问题概论”，有的编辑就根据几本小册子给他提了一大堆意见，使作者感到困难。这就是教条主义的审稿方法。
    针对目前出版物又缺又滥的情况，人民出版社副社长曾彦修说：出版物又缺又滥的情况是严重的，除此之外还有“慢”。比如，出版工作缺乏整个方针，而让教条主义长期存在。出版社把出书看成技术问题，追逐出书指标。编辑光注意查对引文等枝节问题，而不注意书稿内容。因此，很多书籍质量不高，都是泛泛而谈，教条主义气味浓厚。书评对出版工作有很大作用。但是，目前很多书评十分肤浅，淡而无味，很少谈学术问题。今后，出版社的工作责任必须明确，可以少负文字引文等方面的责任，而多注意组稿等总的方面。
    出版需要严肃，写作需要认真
    有的同志还对出版界风气提出意见，并对著作界提出要求。曾彦修说，目前出书过于随便，这种风气是不好的。不少作者不愿意艰苦地写有价值的学术论文，而去拼拼凑凑地写书。杂志上刚刚发表了一篇文章，过了几天就交出版社出版，这种情况在上海特别严重。这在实际上就是浪费纸张，鼓励作者粗制滥造。并且，出版译本也不严肃。没有学术价值的教条主义的译本出得太多，上海人民出版社在这方面有很大的缺点。希望今后出版界不要提倡浅薄，著作界翻译界也要注意提高质量。
    解决体制问题，改进稿费制度
    有些同志还特别提出出版事业的体制问题，并对领导机关提出一些批评。曾彦修说，体制问题关系到编辑、印刷和发行等制度，目前关于这些方面十分混乱，领导机关长期不作考虑，这是官僚主义的表现。蓝钰和工人出版社副社长吴从云在基本上同意这个意见，认为如不考虑这个问题，贯彻百家争鸣是有困难的。他们希望领导上迅速召开会议研究讨论。
    关于纸张不足问题，许多同志认为这个问题是严重的，但是只要调节得好，也可以得到适当解决。郭敬说，目前有的出版社感到纸张不足，而有的书却大量积压，今后应该更合理地进行分配。
    此外，有的同志认为，目前稿费过高（特别是一部分报刊），而且很不统一，这也是一个值得研究的问题。
