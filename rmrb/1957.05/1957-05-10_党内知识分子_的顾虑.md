The Concerns of "Intellectuals Within the Party"
    Lǐ Yuè

After reading the "Beijing Letter" published in the "Wenhui Daily" on May 3rd, I felt quite moved.

I think striving for democracy is not easy, and enjoying democracy is not simple either. Many comrades had the courage to strive for democracy in the undemocratic old days, and even if they "fought" until their heads were broken, they had no concerns. But today, after winning democracy, they lack the courage to enjoy democracy, worrying about this and worrying about that. Of course, "enjoying" democracy does not mean sleeping soundly on a democratic soft bed, but includes developing democracy and seeking more complete and advanced democracy. For example, criticism and self-criticism are important contents of today's democratic life, and also a struggle within the people. Compared with the struggle against the enemy, this kind of struggle is often more complex, more delicate, and sometimes even more difficult. Some comrades who dared to brave the enemy's artillery fire hesitate at the threshold of criticism and self-criticism.

The "Beijing Letter" talks about "intellectuals within the Party," and even "fairly responsible comrades," which is even more noteworthy. This comrade clearly saw "the seriousness of dogmatism and bureaucracy in his department," and in someone else's office "listed many facts" and "talked滔滔地 for an hour and a half, as if he hadn't finished yet," but he was unwilling to publicly express his opinion. Why? First, because he "deals with the ministry every day" and is afraid of damaging the "relationship" between superiors and subordinates. Second, "the dogmatic practices in the ministry were all implemented through my hands... In the eyes of the masses, am I not a dogmatist!" As far as I know, this "concern" is quite representative of "intellectuals within the Party."

Why do they have such "concerns"? Why can't the "dogmatists" of the past openly criticize dogmatism after recognizing the errors of dogmatism? Using today's new self to criticize yesterday's old self, a "rebellion," isn't it even more effective in killing dogmatism? But in this case, criticism will inevitably be self-criticism in nature, and he has "concerns"!

Many "intellectuals within the Party," when faced with criticism and self-criticism, often first think of their own "face," "prestige," and so on, forgetting the interests of the Party and the people. They are often unwilling to honestly and openly admit their shortcomings and mistakes, and discuss with the masses how to overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes, striving for a genuine face and genuine prestige without brackets. Some even hide behind the prestige of the Party to subtly cover up their shortcomings and mistakes, and when they can no longer cover them up, they "keep their mouths shut"!

A person who doesn't have the courage to criticize himself certainly doesn't have the courage to criticize others, fearing that he will "damage relationships." In fact, it would be better to "damage" the kind of superior-subordinate "relationship" reflected in the "Beijing Letter." You see, the "ministry" "completely avoids talking about dogmatism, as if there is no dogmatism at all here," while the "fairly responsible comrade" who "deals with the ministry every day" "lists many facts" proving that there is serious dogmatism and bureaucracy in his department, but for the sake of "relationships," he can only talk about it quietly. One is afraid of democracy, and the other is afraid of not having democracy, and the "commonality" between the two is the fear of criticism and self-criticism. If this kind of "relationship" is not "damaged," how can a normal superior-subordinate relationship be established, how can a normal Party democratic life be carried out, and how can they take the lead in implementing the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend"?

The various concerns of "intellectuals within the Party" reflect the abnormal Party democratic life in some departments and units. The more "concerns" there are, the less courage there is for criticism and self-criticism, and the concerns of "intellectuals within the Party" can easily cause concerns among intellectuals outside the Party. This is a problem that deserves serious attention at present.

    “党内知识分子”的顾虑
    李跃
    5月3日“文汇报”发表了一篇“北京书简”，读后颇有感触。
    我想，争取民主，固不容易，享受民主也不简单。不少同志在不民主的旧时代有争取民主的勇气，即使“争”得头破血流，也没有什么顾虑；可是在争得了民主的今天，他们反而缺乏享受民主的勇气，“顾虑”这，“顾虑”那。自然，“享受”民主不等于在民主的软床上睡大觉，而是包括发展民主，求得更充分、更高级的民主在内。举例说，批评和自我批评是今天民主生活的重要内容之一，同时也是人民内部的斗争。这种斗争，跟对敌斗争比较起来，往往更复杂，更细致，有时甚至更艰难。有些敢于冒着敌人的炮火的同志，却在批评和自我批评这个关口面前却步了。
    “北京书简”说的是“党内知识分子”，而且是“相当负责的同志”，这就更值得注意了。这位同志明明看出了“他这个业务部门里教条主义和官僚主义的严重性”，在别人的办公室里“列举了许多事实”，“滔滔地讲了一个半钟头，仿佛还没有讲完似的”，可是他无论如何不愿公开发表他的意见。为什么呢？第一，因为他“每天和部里打交道”，怕搞坏了上下级“关系”；第二，“部里那些教条主义的做法，都是通过我的手贯彻下去的。……在群众眼中我何尝不是个教条主义者呢！”据我所知，在“党内知识分子”中，这确是有相当代表性的“顾虑”。
    为什么有这种“顾虑”呢？为什么过去的“教条主义者”在认识教条主义的错误之后，不能公开批评教条主义呢？以今天的新我来批判昨天的旧我，“反戈一击”，不是更能制教条主义于死命吗？可是这么一来，批评就必然带有自我批评的性质，他有“顾虑”！
    不少“党内知识分子”在接触批评和自我批评的时候，往往首先想到自己的“面子”、“威信”之类，而忘记了党和人民的利益。他们往往不肯老老实实地公开承认自己的缺点和错误，同群众一起来商讨克服缺点、改正错误的办法，争取不加括弧的真面子、真威信，有的甚至躲在党的威信后边转弯抹角地掩饰自己的缺点和错误，而到了掩饰不了的时候，便“守口如瓶”！
    没有勇气批评自己的人，一定也没有勇气批评别人，生怕“搞坏了关系”。其实，像“北京书简”所反映的那种上下级“关系”，还是“搞坏”了好。你瞧，“部里”“完全撇开教条主义不谈，好像我们这儿压根儿没有教条主义似的”，而那个“每天和部里打交道”的“相当负责的同志”，却“列举了许多事实”，证明他这个业务部门存在着严重的教条主义和官僚主义，但为了“关系”，只能悄悄地谈。一个怕民主，一个怕不民主，而双方的“共性”便是怕批评和自我批评。这种“关系”不“搞坏”，怎能建立正常的上下级关系，怎能开展正常的党内民主生活，怎能带头贯彻执行党的“齐放”、“争鸣”的方针？
    “党内知识分子”的这样那样的顾虑，反映了有些部门、有些单位的党内民主生活不正常。“顾虑”越多，批评和自我批评的勇气越少，而“党内知识分子”的顾虑，又很容易引起党外知识分子的顾虑。这是当前很值得注意的一个问题。
