U.S. Military Runs Amok in South Korea
Robbery in Broad Daylight, Killing for Pleasure

This newspaper reports comprehensively: On April 16th, eighty U.S. invading army military police attacked over three hundred South Korean households, looting property and kidnapping over seventy Koreans. This incident has aroused great anger among the Korean people and condemnation from international public opinion. According to South Korean newspapers, it is not the first time that the U.S. military has openly robbed and arbitrarily slaughtered peaceful residents in South Korea.

In July of last year, a U.S. soldier stationed at Gimpo Airport tricked South Korean boy Sun Shi-yun out of 56 U.S. dollars by claiming he would sell him some foreign goods. A few days later, when Sun Shi-yun went to demand his money back, the American soldier fired three shots, killing him on the spot. In the autumn of last year, three American soldiers forced the owner of the "Culture Sound Society" in Yeongdeungpo to buy their stolen goods—a radio. After receiving 110 U.S. dollars from the owner, Jin Xuan-xiang, they not only didn't give him the radio, but also beat him severely. Cases of American soldiers robbing taxi drivers of their money are also common.

American soldiers often use South Koreans as targets, killing for pleasure. In February of this year, when a U.S. military train passed through 67 Wanseok-dong, Incheon, U.S. military police on the train opened fire for no reason, and a passing girl, Li Fangpei, was brutally killed. In September of last year, an American soldier stationed in Daeryeong-dong, Busan, killed a Korean youth, Jin Zhongqiu, with a pistol, on the grounds that Jin Zhongqiu had argued with him. Even more cruel, on July 27th of last year, American soldiers stationed in Incheon falsely accused Zhang Chengquan's wife from Chongyi-dong of stealing gasoline, and set her house on fire with gasoline, burning her entire family of six alive.

### 美军在南朝鲜胡作非为  白昼抢劫　杀人取乐

    美军在南朝鲜胡作非为
    白昼抢劫　杀人取乐
    本报综合报道　4月16日，美国侵略军八十名宪兵袭击南朝鲜的三百多户居民，抢劫财物，绑架七十多个朝鲜人的事件，引起朝鲜人民的极大愤怒和国际舆论的谴责。据南朝鲜报刊透露，美军在南朝鲜公开抢劫，任意屠杀和平居民的事件，这并不是第一次。
    去年7月间，驻金浦飞机场美军一个士兵，说要卖给南朝鲜少年孙世云一些洋货，骗取了他五十六块美元。过几天，孙世云去要钱，那个美国兵就连开三枪，当场把他打死。去年秋天，有三个美国兵强迫永登浦“文化之音社”的店主收买他们的脏物——一架收音机，但他们从店主金铉尚手里拿到一百一十块美元之后，不但不给收音机，反将店主痛打一顿。美国兵乘坐出租汽车抢劫司机钱财的事，也屡见不鲜。
    美国兵时常拿南朝鲜人当靶子，杀人取乐。今年2月间，美军列车通过仁川市万石洞六十七番地时，车上美军宪兵无故开枪，过路的女孩李芳培惨遭杀害。去年9月，驻釜山市大灵洞的一个美国兵，用手枪杀死了朝鲜青年金钟逑，理由是金钟逑和他吵了嘴。更残酷的是，去年7月27日，驻仁川的美国兵诬赖崇义洞张成权的妻子偷了汽油，就用汽油点燃了她的房子，全家六口活活被烧死。（附图片）
