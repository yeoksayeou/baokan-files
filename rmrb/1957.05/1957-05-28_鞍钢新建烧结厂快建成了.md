    Anshan Iron and Steel's New Sintering Plant is Nearing Completion
    (Our Dispatch) The construction and installation of China's largest artificial rich ore factory—Anshan Iron and Steel's new sintering plant—is nearing completion.
    The construction of this plant is divided into two phases. The first phase was completed and put into production last October. Immediately afterwards, the second phase of the project began, and by mid-May, all of the more than 200 sets of mechanical equipment in the plant's more than 20 workshops had been installed. Now, the last giant sintering machine—Sintering Machine No. 4—has also been installed.
    This plant is a mechanized and automated factory. Once fully operational, its output will be about one and a half times larger than the total output of Anshan Iron and Steel's two existing sintering plants. (Hong Sanli) (Attached picture)

    鞍钢新建烧结厂快建成了
    本报讯　我国最大的人造富矿工厂——鞍钢新建烧结厂的建筑安装工程已经接近竣工。
    这个厂的建厂工程分两期进行。去年10月第一期工程竣工并且投入了生产。紧接着就开始进行第二期工程，到5月中旬，全厂二十多个车间的二百多台机械设备全部安装完毕。现在，最后一台巨大的烧结机——四号烧结机也安装好了。
    这个厂是一座机械化自动化的工厂，全部投入生产以后，它的生产量比鞍钢现有的两座烧结厂的总量要大一倍半左右。　（洪三礼）（附图片）
