Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch: Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, clamored on the 25th that the United States must "take action against those responsible" for the anti-American incidents in Taiwan, "no matter how high a position any of them may hold."

Bridges, a key Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services Committee, argued that the U.S. government should make it clear to the Chiang Kai-shek group that if incidents of so-called infringement of U.S. sovereignty continue, "it will absolutely not be tolerated."

Bridges made no mention of the Reynolds' shooting of Liu Ziran, but instead, demanded "immediate and full compensation for losses" and that "satisfactory guarantees must be obtained" to ensure that such incidents "do not recur," revealing his overbearing attitude.

While U.S. officials have expressed shock at the scale and intensity of the anti-American demonstrations, they also fear that this incident will fuel the movement in the United States to cut the defense budget and foreign aid.

Senator Willis Robertson has asked the U.S. Army to consider withdrawing some of its troops stationed in seventy-two countries. Robertson admitted that the large number of U.S. soldiers and airmen stationed abroad are constantly causing friction with its allies.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 25th that it would reduce the number of U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan. The Pentagon said that approximately six hundred people, mostly members of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, would be transferred elsewhere.

Many American newspapers carried news of the anti-American incidents in Taipei with headline banners on the front page. "The Washington Post" said that the Taipei incident was one of the most alarming anti-American incidents in a decade.

    "The World Telegram and Sun's" editorial on the 25th said, "It is shocking that such a violent anti-American disturbance has erupted in Taiwan." The editorial admitted: The United States is at a disadvantage in this matter. First, there are too many American personnel in Taiwan, which is bound to bring unpleasant things to mind; second, the U.S. authorities condoned the murderer and used an army-chartered plane to help him escape, which was a rash and provocative act.

    "The Washington Star" expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation given by Dong Xian Guang, the Chiang Kai-shek group's "ambassador" to the United States, regarding the Taipei incident. The newspaper said in an editorial: "One hopes his words are correct, but the persistence and destructiveness of this riot give rise to concern and questions."

    "The New York Times" commented on the 25th: It is the responsibility of the United States to reduce the possibility of friction to a minimum. In this respect, the situation in Taiwan is clearly a failure. Corrective measures must be taken. It said: "Nationalist China cannot withstand this, and neither can we. Restoring mutual understanding is necessary."

### 美国报纸纷纷发出惊呼  布里奇斯威吓蒋介石集团

    美国报纸纷纷发出惊呼
    布里奇斯威吓蒋介石集团
    本报综合报道　据新华社26日消息：参议院共和党政策委员会主席布里奇斯25日叫嚣，美国必须要对台湾的反美事件“负有责任的人采取行动”，“不管其中任何人可能占有多么高的地位”。
    布里奇斯是参议院拨款委员会和军事委员会的主要共和党委员，他主张美国政府向蒋介石集团表明，如果继续发生所谓侵犯美国主权的事件，“那就绝对不能容忍”。
    布里奇斯绝口不谈雷诺枪杀刘自然的事情，却蛮横地要求“立即完全赔偿损失”，“必须获得满意保证”，使这种事件“不再重新发生”。
    美国官员们在明白表示对这次反美示威的规模和激烈程度感到震惊的同时，也担心这一事件将会给美国国内削减国防预算和援外费用的运动火上加油。
    参议员威利斯·罗伯逊要求美国陆军考虑把它的驻在七十二个国家的军队撤回一部分。罗伯逊承认美国的驻在国外的大量士兵和空军人员和它的盟国之间不断发生磨擦。
    美国国防部25日宣布，它将减少驻在台湾的美国军事人员。国防部说，大约有六百人将被调到别处去，他们大多是军事援助顾问团的人员。
    许多美国报纸都以首页通栏大标题刊载台北反美事件的消息。“华盛顿邮报”说，台北事件是十年来最惊人的反美事件之一。
      “世界电讯与太阳报”25日的社论说，“这样猛烈的反美纷乱竟然在台湾爆发，这是令人震惊的事。”社论承认：美国在这一件事上是处于不利地位的。首先是美国在台湾的人员太多，这必会使人想起不愉快的事情，其次是美国当局纵容杀人犯并且用陆军包租的飞机放他逃走，是轻率的、刺激人的行为。
      “华盛顿明星晚报”对蒋介石集团驻美“大使”董显光就台北事件的解释表示不满。这家报纸在社论中说：“人们希望他的话是对的，但是这次骚动的持久性和破坏性却引起忧虑和疑问。”
      “纽约时报”25日的评论说：把发生磨擦的可能性减少到最低限度，是美国的责任。在这一方面，在台湾的情况显然是失败的。必须采取纠正措施。它说：“国民党中国经不起这点，我们也经不起。恢复相互谅解是必要的。”
