    Morning
    The stars in the sky are still twinkling, and people are still lingering in dreams. We step on the morning frost on the road, the sound of brooms and fallen leaves gently echoing under our feet. A long whistle cuts through the sky, and the first tram leaves the depot. The morning sun shines on our faces, and beads of sweat glisten on our foreheads. The wide and straight road extends to the unseen distance. We feel an unspeakable pride as we sweep the streets for people to admire. I wish I could get up even earlier tomorrow and make it even more beautiful than today. I wish I could forever wave my broom and sing with it in the morning breeze.

    早晨
    云海天上的星星还在眨眼，人们还留恋在梦乡，我们踏着马路上的晨霜，笤帚和落叶在我们脚下轻响。长长的笛声划过长空，第一辆电车开出了库房，朝阳照射在我们脸上，汗珠在我们额前闪光。宽广笔直的马路，伸展到看不清的远方，我们怀着说不出的骄傲，把街道扫得任人欣赏。我愿明天起得更早，把它打扮得比今天还漂亮，我愿永远挥动着笤帚，在晨风中随着它歌唱。
