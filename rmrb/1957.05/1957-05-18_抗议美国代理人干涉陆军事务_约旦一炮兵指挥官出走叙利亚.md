Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: According to a Middle East News Agency dispatch from Damascus, a Jordanian army artillery commander, Major Ehsan Halawani, recently defected to Syria seeking political asylum. He wrote a letter of resignation from Syria to the King of Jordan, stating that his reason for resigning was to protest against foreign-bought elements interfering in Jordanian army affairs for the benefit of American imperialism. Halawani had been under house arrest before fleeing Jordan.

The Middle East News Agency also reported that the Jordanian government intends to dissolve all municipal or local councils that include nationalists. King Hussein of Jordan has already authorized the Council of Ministers on May 15 to dissolve any municipal or local council based on the advice of the Minister of Interior and to appoint new municipal or local councils.

The Jordanian authorities are continuing to implement repressive measures. According to the Jordanian "Al Jihad" newspaper on May 16, Jordanian public security forces arrested a number of parliamentarians, including Hadi, the former Minister of National Economy in the Nabulsi cabinet, and Salih, the Minister of Agriculture. Other people were also arrested in Nablus and Zerqa.

The Jordanian military governor issued an order on May 16 declaring that anyone who disseminates words or pictures that damage the government's prestige or the King's dignity will be sentenced to imprisonment.

Meanwhile, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has decided to dismiss one hundred and sixty-two Jordanian staff members and school teachers because they were associated with political parties dissolved after the recent Jordanian events.

Some Jordanian newspapers and radio stations have launched a propaganda campaign hostile to Egypt and Syria. The Lebanese "Al-Sharq" newspaper said that, according to reliable sources, this propaganda campaign was carried out at the instigation of the American Embassy in Amman, and that the staff of the American Embassy maintains close contact with the current Jordanian government.

King Hussein of Jordan's decision not to go to Baghdad to attend the meeting of the Kings of Iraq and Saudi Arabia has aroused speculation in various quarters. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Beirut, this is because he wants to avoid giving Egypt and Syria the impression that he is severing the ties of Arab solidarity.

The report pointed out that the difficult situation in Jordan is also one of the reasons why Hussein is unwilling to leave the country at this time. It said that the imposition of military martial law, a series of purges that have disintegrated the highest administrative bodies, and the arrest or house arrest of political party leaders, have silenced most of the parliamentarians elected in the last general election, all of which explain why Hussein is unwilling to be far from his capital.

The report said that Jordan does not intend to appear to be joining the Baghdad Pact. Hussein's remaining in the country hopes that both his friends and enemies will appreciate his cautious reservation.

### 抗议美国代理人干涉陆军事务  约旦一炮兵指挥官出走叙利亚

    抗议美国代理人干涉陆军事务
    约旦一炮兵指挥官出走叙利亚
    新华社17日讯　据中东通讯社大马士革消息，约旦陆军的一个炮兵指挥官埃赫桑·哈拉瓦尼少校最近出走到叙利亚要求政治避难。他从叙利亚写了一封辞职信给约旦国王，声明他所以辞职是为了抗议被外国收买的分子为了美帝国主义的利益干涉约旦陆军事务。哈拉瓦尼在逃离约旦以前曾经被软禁。
    中东通讯社还报道，约旦政府打算解散一切有民族主义者在内的市议会或者地方议会。约旦国王侯赛因已经在5月15日授权大臣会议可以根据内政大臣的建议解散任何市议会或地方议会，并且可以任命新的市议会或地方议会。
    约旦当局正在继续执行镇压措施。据约旦“圣战报”5月16日报道，约旦公安部队又逮捕了一些议员，其中包括前纳布西内阁的国民经济大臣哈迪和农业大臣萨勒。在纳布鲁斯和泽林还逮捕了其他一些人。
    约旦军事长官在5月16日颁布命令，宣布任何人如果散布文字或图画损害政府威信或国王尊严，都将被判处徒刑。
    同时，联合国巴勒斯坦难民救济及就业局决定开除一百六十二个约旦籍职员和学校教师，因为他们同最近的约旦事变以后被解散的政党有关。
    约旦一些报纸和电台曾经发动了敌视埃及和叙利亚的宣传运动。黎巴嫩“东方报”说，据可靠消息，这一宣传运动是在美国驻安曼大使馆的怂恿下进行的，美国大使馆的工作人员同目前的约旦政府保持着密切的联系。
    约旦国王侯赛因决定不去巴格达参加伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯国王的会谈，引起各方面的推测。据法新社贝鲁特消息说，这是由于他要避免给埃及和叙利亚这样一种印象，那就是他切断了阿拉伯国家的团结关系。
    消息指出，约旦国内的困难局势也是侯赛因不愿在这个时候出国的原因之一。它说，实行军事戒严制度，一系列的清洗瓦解了最高行政机构，逮捕政党领袖或加以软禁，使得上次大选产生的大部分议员默不作声，这种种情况说明侯赛因为什么不愿远离他的京城。
    消息说，约旦无意显出它似乎将加入巴格达集团。侯赛因留在国内不出去，希望他的朋友和敌人都体会到他的谨慎的保留态度。
