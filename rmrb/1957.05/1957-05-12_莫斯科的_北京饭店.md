    Moscow's "Beijing Hotel"

    The "Beijing Hotel" on Mayakovsky Square in Moscow is a seven-story building with a total of 359 rooms. Currently, all the rooms are full of guests, some of whom are visitors from China.

    The Chinese-style "Beijing Restaurant" in the hotel will soon open. Guests will be able to enjoy Chinese cuisine here. The large restaurant has two rows of neat, large vermilion columns, and the ceiling is blue. The materials used to decorate this restaurant, especially the various paints, were shipped from China, and the decorations were carried out under the leadership of Chinese technicians. There is a snack bar in the corner of the upper part of the building. The snack bar is connected to a terrace for summer relaxation, from which you can overlook the beautiful scenery of Moscow's central streets. (Huang)

    莫斯科的“北京饭店”
    在莫斯科的马雅科夫斯基广场上的“北京饭店”是一幢七层楼的大厦，它共有三百五十九个房间。目前全部房间都住满了旅客，其中有些是从中国去的客人。
    旅馆里的中国式的“北京餐厅”不久就要开幕。客人们可以在这里吃到中国风味的饭菜。大餐厅里有两列整整齐齐的朱红色的大圆柱，天花板是蓝色的。装饰这个餐厅的材料，特别是各色油漆是从中国运去的，这些装饰也是由中国技工领导着进行的。在大厦上部的拐角地方设有小吃部。小吃部紧连着夏天乘凉用的凉台，从这里可以眺望莫斯科中心街道的美丽景色。（黄）
