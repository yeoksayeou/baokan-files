Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting last night to discuss the launch of a rectification campaign within Party organizations across Guangdong province, based on the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions regarding the rectification movement.

At the meeting, the Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to immediately begin formulating a plan for conducting rectification throughout the Party organizations in the province. Before the plan is finalized, Party organizations at all levels across the province must first properly convey and study Chairman Mao Zedong's two reports on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, as well as the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. The meeting decided that Provincial Committee Secretaries and members Feng Baiju, Qu Mengjue, Li Jianzhen, Zhao Ziyang, Wen Minsheng, He Ximing, and Zhang Gensheng would go to various regional and prefectural Party committees to strengthen guidance in this work.

Prior to this, the Guangdong Provincial Committee had already held several standing committee meetings and various specialized meetings to study the contradictions among the people existing within the province. The Guangdong Provincial Committee believes that due to the complexity of Guangdong's social strata and its relatively complex environment, there have been many shortcomings in our work over the past few years, and problems exist in our leadership style. Furthermore, considering the state of the Party organization, those who joined the Party after liberation account for 90% of the total membership, and ideological education for them has been insufficient. Even among some Party members who joined earlier, some comrades have developed unhealthy ideological styles. Therefore, the various contradictions reflected among the people in Guangdong are also relatively complex. In light of this situation, the Provincial Committee believes that the Central Committee's decision to launch a rectification campaign, opposing bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, to improve the Marxist ideological level of Party members, improve our work, and correctly handle contradictions among the people, is very urgent and necessary for Guangdong Province. At the meeting convened by the Provincial Committee yesterday, the Provincial Committee, based on the situation within the province, listed thirteen issues related to contradictions among the people, and assigned relevant departments to conduct further research in preparation for reviewing and summarizing work during the rectification campaign.

    研究十三项人民内部矛盾问题
    新华社广州2日电  中共广东省委员会昨天晚上举行会议，根据中共中央关于整风运动的指示，讨论在广东全省党组织内开展整风运动的问题。
    会议上，广东省委决定立即着手制定在全省党组织内进行整风的计划。在计划定出以前，全省各地党组织首先要做好对于毛泽东主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的两个报告以及党中央关于整风运动指示的传达和学习工作。会议决定由省委书记和委员冯白驹、区梦觉、李坚真、赵紫阳、文敏生、贺希明、张根生分别到各区党委、地委加强这项工作的指导。
    在此以前，广东省委已经开了几次常委会议和各种专门的会议，研究省内存在的人民内部矛盾。广东省委认为：由于广东的社会阶层很复杂，所处的环境也比较复杂，几年来在工作中有不少缺点，领导作风也存有毛病；再从党的组织状况来看，解放以后入党的占党员总数90％，而对他们的思想教育又做得很不够；即使在一些入党较早的党员当中，有些同志也滋长了不良的思想作风；因此，广东人民内部所反映出的各种矛盾也是比较复杂的。根据这种情况，省委认为，这次中共中央决定开展整风运动，反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，来提高党员的马克思主义的思想水平，改进工作，正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，对于广东省来说是非常迫切的、必要的。在昨天省委召开的会议上，省委已根据省内的情况列出了十三项有关人民内部矛盾的问题，分别指定有关部门作进一步的研究，为整风时检查总结工作做准备。
