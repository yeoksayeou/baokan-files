Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 10th: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a plenary meeting on the 8th, deciding that the rectification movement in organizations above the county level should commence immediately.

The meeting held that the focus of the province's rectification movement is to resolve the contradictions between Party and government leading organs at all levels and the masses of workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals. As for the contradictions between leaders and the led within the organizations, they should be fully exposed without any constraints. At the same time, cadres who are led should be encouraged to offer suggestions focusing on the contradictions between the leadership and the broad masses, rather than dwelling on details such as living welfare. The main aspect of the contradiction lies with the leadership, and the key to resolving the contradiction lies in overcoming bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in leadership, raising ideological awareness, changing work styles, and achieving the goal of uniting all the people to build socialism.

Ye Fei analyzed the current ideological situation of Party and government leading cadres above the county level in the province at the meeting. He believed that the pride, complacency, lack of democracy, and resistance to criticism that are widespread among leading cadres are the main obstacles to the rectification movement. These obstacles must be broken down to ensure the smooth progress of the rectification movement. Ye Fei said that the people are very excited about our rectification and are willing to offer criticism to help us rectify; the key problem is that some leading cadres are unwilling to listen to criticism and do not actively seek it. He called on leading organs and leading cadres at all levels to put down their official airs, eliminate the bad habit of vanity and arrogance, and actively solicit criticism from all sides to create conditions conducive to rectification, rather than conducting rectification behind closed doors. He also pointed out that the current abnormal phenomenon of some Party organizations' first secretaries not personally leading this movement must be changed immediately.

    戒除虚骄习气主动征求批评
    叶飞谈必须打破整风运动的障碍
    据新华社福州10日电　中共福建省委在8日召开全体会议，决定县以上机关的整风运动要从现在起立即行动起来。
    会议认为全省整风运动的重点是解决各级党政领导机关同工人、农民、学生、知识分子群众的矛盾。至于机关内部领导和被领导的矛盾既要充分揭露，不加任何约束，又要鼓励被领导的干部多从领导和广大群众的矛盾着眼来提意见，不要纠缠于生活福利之类的细节。矛盾的主要方面在于领导，解决矛盾的关键在于克服领导上的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，提高思想，改变作风，达到团结全体人民建设社会主义的目的。
    叶飞在会上分析了全省县以上党政领导干部当前的思想情况，认为领导干部中普遍存在的骄傲自满、缺乏民主、批评不得的思想是整风运动的主要障碍，必须打破这种障碍，使整风运动顺利开展起来。叶飞说，人民群众对我们进行整风都很兴奋，愿意提出批评帮助我们整风；问题关键在于一些领导干部听不进批评，不主动去征求批评。他号召各级领导机关和领导干部把官架子放下来，戒除虚骄之气，主动地去征求各方面的批评意见，创造有利于整风的条件，不要关起门来整风。他还指出，当前有些部门党组织的第一书记还没有亲自动手领导这个运动的不正常现象，必须立即改变。
