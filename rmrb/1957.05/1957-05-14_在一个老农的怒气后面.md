    Behind an Old Peasant's Anger
        Our Correspondent Lü Jianzhong
    Li Shiduo toiled as a manual laborer in the Northeast for most of his life. Two of his children died before they were five years old. Poverty and anxiety left him with a stubborn, irritable personality and a deep hatred for evil forces. In 1935, he and his wife returned to their hometown of Haiyang, Shandong, to rebuild their lives and had one last son, but just as they had raised him to the point where he could call "Papa," he suddenly died of measles. From then on, the couple sighed deeply and began their lonely, bleak old age.

    When I returned to my hometown this time, I went to see Li Shiduo, who was lying alone in bed, already a man with graying temples. We talked about our experiences since we last met; later, when we talked about the village's agricultural producers' cooperative, his mood changed somewhat. He sized me up from head to toe with a probing look, and then asked in a light but forceful tone, like a teacher questioning a student: "I heard that the People's Daily is the central newspaper, so where does the material in it come from?"

    For a moment, I couldn't figure out what he was getting at with this sudden question, so I could only give him a general answer: "The People's Daily is also a newspaper of the masses, and the material comes from the masses." "Is it heard directly from the mouths of the masses? Hmm?" He fixed his gaze on me again.

    Li Shiduo had served as the chairman of the village peasants' association during the land reform. He was very resolute in the struggle against class enemies, standing at the head of the masses, pointing at the nose of the big-headed, evil landlord in the village, and scolding him so vehemently that the evil landlord bowed his head and collapsed at his feet. Later, when the village organized mutual aid teams and cooperatives, he participated in all of them, and his wife also became a women's cadre in the village. The sparks of socialism shone brightly in their lonely twilight years, and they no longer felt like isolated and helpless people. But I didn't understand, now that he and I had reunited after a long separation, where did this anger come from? So I said calmly: "Shiduo, you are a straightforward person, you can just say whatever is on your mind directly."

    He sneered a few times and said: "Several of us old people often squat by the base of the wall in winter to bask in the sun and read the newspaper. Today, when I opened the newspaper, it said there was a bumper harvest here; tomorrow, when I opened the newspaper, it said that work was being carried out on a large scale there. I remember only once, it criticized a county magistrate for not going down to the countryside. Everyone said, it's strange, even ten fingers have their lengths, how come the newspaper is full of good news? Where does this material come from? Doesn't the newspaper office have anyone come to our village to take a look?"

    Then, he said a whole string of harsh words, such as "cooperativization is absurd," "the lower levels are messing around, and the upper levels are bureaucratic," and so on.

    I listened silently, secretly laughing to myself: You old fellow, your old habits haven't changed! So I used facts to reason with him: "Shiduo, you are quick-tempered and look at problems from only one side. Last year, the first year of advanced cooperativization, the country increased grain production by 20 billion jin; our Jiaodong's dozen or so counties also increased grain production by 800 million jin and peanut production by 100 million jin last year. These are all facts, can you say that cooperativization is absurd? Your village suffered a flood and reduced production, that is also a fact. But in the whole country and the whole county, this is just a small black spot. Besides..."
   “Alright, there is no use for you to say more, we will not agree anyway.” He cut me off with a light of anger in his eyes. “You are a reporter, you run a lot of places. I eat here, wear here, I can only see my own village. Chairman Mao has never taught you to only see the whole nation and not a single village, to forget the shortcoming when you see achievements...

   “Um, wait a moment, I have not finished yet! It is true that we suffered from a flood last year, but the village leadership told the higher ups, ah, we reduced the output, there is nothing we can do, it is natural disaster! And then the matter is finished. Is that the truth? Is it true that they can push all the reasons for the decrease in output on the natural disaster? You think about it, when the flood came last year, our village had a lot of labor force, some villagers had nothing to do and their hands were itchy, the village leadership did not take the time to organize them to drain the water; after the water drained, they did not hurry to organize the labor force to weed the land, the grass grows suddenly, so they had to panic. And also the land was not properly hoed, the young

  People do their job sloppily, like a swarm of bees, when they hoe one mu of sweet potatoes, they would cut off about 10 roots of seedlings. But I, when I see a small grass under the roots of the seedlings, I would use my fingers carefully to pull it out. The young people hoe ten ridges, the old people hoe eight ridges. But in the evening when we record the work points, the young people record ten points and the old people record six points. Others do not dare to raise opinions, but I insist on raising, I criticize the young people for doing their work without quality and without skills, but the young people retort that old people’s minds are getting rusty. You see, is that the mind work points that are recorded here, or is that the job work points? Ah! No wonder when old people meet in the market, they shake their heads and sigh that now the old people are worthless, and the old skills do not count!”

    At this moment, I started to understand, I was able to see what was hidden behind the annoyed gaze of his eyes. So I said, “Did you report these suggestions to the upper level?”
   “Report to the upper level? Last year, I never saw any official from the upper level. Um! True, last autumn after the harvest, some officer with the last name Liu, I don’t remember his name, who had a dark spot at the corner of his eyes, came and stayed for a few days. In the meeting, he started to talk about profit sharing, and then he mobilized the villagers to invest. I raised those ideas to them, and I thought, since it is an official from the higher level, they might be proper. Ha! You are wishful thinking, there is no use at all. He rolled his eyes, and said coldly: old man, rest assured, you will not be starved, there are five guarantees in the cooperative, what are you afraid of? You hear it, is that the word of a higher level official? If the cooperative is not doing well, and you do not harvest grain, you are going to use Northwest wind to ensure me? Forget it, nobody will take care of my opinions when I raise them, I cannot rely on the cooperative, you want me to invest? Ha! No way, it will make a sound when I throw my money in the cold water!”

    His wife came back, he asked in a nonchalant way: “What kind of meeting did you have? Why are you coming back so late? You should hurry to make dinner!”
   “The expanding cadre meeting! Revising the output increasing plan, mobilizing the villagers to invest.” The wife said as she washed her hands and prepared to cut the vegetables.
   “I knew that it would be this!” Shi Duo was still impatient.
   “I knew that you would be like this; but you are wrong this time.” The wife intercepted his words, and stated matter-of-factly: “No matter what it is, there will always be a turn, but your mind never turns. A few days ago, the village leadership went to the county to convene a meeting, and summarized the work of last year, and discussed how to run the village in a democratic way, the village leadership did a self-examination on the issues in the village. In the meeting today, they decided to convene the villagers’ meeting, to let everyone raise suggestions, to accept the lessons from last year, to execute contract work and contract product, and to make the labor organization and work point recording reasonable. Comrade Liu said that the county is going to organize the people to dig a river!”
   “Comrade Liu? Which comrade Liu?” Shi Duo’s tone softened.
   “It is comrade Liu who came here last autumn, he convened a meeting on the top, learned from the instructions of the higher level, saying that we did not have enough experience in running high-level cooperatives in the first year, and we are going to correct the shortcoming from last year. Comrade Liu said that in a few days, he will organize the elder villagers to have a discussion, and research production techniques, and please also join. Comrade Liu will come and see you after a while!”

    Shi Duo was stunned for a while, without saying anything. But he was obviously relieved. He stood up, opened the layer of paper windows inside the glass window, and the room was brightened up immediately. Then, he got off the ground, put his hands behind his back and looked at his wife cutting the vegetables, walked around the yard, walked in again and asked his wife in a soft voice: “What, what are you making for dinner?”
   “Boil tofu and cabbage!” The wife looked up at him and then looked down and continued cutting the vegetables.
   “Well, isn’t there some fish in the cupboard, why don’t we keep it for comrade Liu when he comes and ask him to eat dinner, um?”
    The wife laughed. When Shi Duo was happy, she asked: “The village is mobilizing for investment, you think, how can we produce without funding, the money in the drawer, I think we should not buy the coffin board right now, what do you think?”
   “Um, frankly to tell you, I never planned to buy it this year. But investment, um! Don’t rush, let’s wait and see if what they are doing is just like what they are saying!”

    在一个老农的怒气后面
        本报记者　吕建中
    李时铎在东北做过多半辈子苦力，两个孩子都不满五岁就死了。贫困和焦心的日子，给他留下来的是倔强、暴躁的性格，和一颗对恶势力深恶痛绝的心。1935年，他和妻子回到山东海阳故乡重新安了家，又生了最后一个儿子，不料刚刚抚养到会喊“爸爸”，突然又生麻疹死了。从此，夫妻俩长叹一声，开始了他们孤独的、惨淡的晚年生活。
    这次我回到故乡，去看李时铎的时候，他一个人躺在床上，已经是鬓发斑白的人了。我们谈了些别后的经历；后来，谈到村里的农业生产合作社，他的情绪有些不一样了。他用一种试探的眼光从头到脚打量我一番，然后用轻而有力的、像是老师考问学生的口气问道：“听说人民日报是中央的报纸，那上面的材料都是从哪儿来的？”
    我一时摸不清他突然提出这个问题的用意何在，就只好给他一个笼统的回答：“人民日报也是群众的报纸，材料是从群众中来的。”“是直接从群众口里听来的？嗯？”他又把眼光逼向我了。
    李时铎在土地改革的时候，曾做过村农会主席，他对阶级敌人斗争非常坚决，站在群众前头，指着村上那个大脑袋壳恶霸地主的鼻子顿足大骂，骂得那恶霸地主低头瘫痪在他的脚下；后来村里组织互助组、合作社，他都参加了，妻子也做了村里的妇女干部。社会主义的火花在他们的寂寞的暮年生活中闪出了光亮，他们不再觉得自己是孤苦无依的人了。可是我不明白，此刻他和我久别重逢，这怒意是缘何而来？于是我便平心静气地说道：“时铎，您是爽直人，您心里有什么话就直接了当地说好了。”
    他冷笑几声，说：“我们几个老年人冬天没事常蹲在墙根下晒太阳，看报纸。今天打开报一看，这里大丰收；明天打开报纸一看，那里工作大开展。记得只有一回，批评过一个县长不下乡。大伙儿就说，真怪，连十个指头还有长有短，怎么报纸上净是喜事？这材料都是从哪儿来的？报社就没一个人到咱村来看看？”
    接着，他就说了一大串刺耳的话，什么“合作化不像话”啦，“下边胡闹，上边官僚”啦，等等。
    我默默地听着，心里暗笑道：您这家伙，老毛病还没改掉呀！于是我便拿事实向他讲道理：“时铎，您这人脾气暴躁，看问题光往一边偏。去年高级合作化第一年，全国就增产了二百亿斤粮食；咱胶东十几个县去年也增产了八亿斤粮食和一亿斤花生。这都是事实，您能说合作化不像话吗？您这村受了水灾，减了产，这也是事实。可是这在全国和全县来说，也只不过是个小黑点。再说……”
   “好了，您不用说了，横竖咱俩说不到一块儿。”他打断了我的话，眼睛里闪着怒光。“您是记者，跑的地方多。我吃在这里，穿在这里，我只能看见我这个村。毛主席从来也没教您只看全国不管一村，看见成绩就忘了缺点。……
   “唔，您等一会，我还没说完呢！去年受水灾，这不假，社干部会跑到上级面前说，啊呀，减产，这没法子，天灾嘛！事情就过去了。难道这是真实的吗？难道能把减产的原因都推在水灾身上吗？您想想看，去年发大水，我们社里劳动力不算少，有些社员闲得手心发痒，社干部不抓紧时间组织他们排水；水退了，又不赶快好好安排劳力锄地，地里草忽的长起来了，这才手忙脚乱。地也没锄好，那些年轻
  人干活呼呼隆隆，像一窝蜂子，锄一亩地瓜就要割掉十来棵苗，而我，看见苗儿根下有一棵小草也小心用手指头把它拔掉。年轻人锄十垅，老年人锄八垅。可是，晚上记工分，年轻人记十分，老年人记六分。别人不敢提意见我偏提，我批评年轻人干活不顾质量，不讲技术，年轻人却反过来说老年人思想发死。您看，难道这记的是思想分，不是工分？唉！难怪老年人赶集碰到一块就摇头叹气，说如今老年人一钱不值，老本事算吃不开了！”
    此刻，我开始明白了，我觉察出他那恼怒的眼光后面藏着的是什么东西。便说：“您这些意见向上级反映过没有呢？”
   “向上级反映？去年一年我没看见过上级什么样儿。唔！不错，去年收罢秋，上面一个什么干部来住过几天，姓刘，名子记不清了，眼角上有块黑斑。开会先讲分红，接着就动员社员投资。我又把上面那些意见给提出来，我想，这是上级的干部，兴许差不多。咳！您妄想，一点用也没有。他翻翻眼皮，冷言冷语地说：老头，您放心好了，饿不着您，合作社有五保，怕什么？您听听，这像上级干部说的话吗？合作社办不好，不收粮食，您拿西北风保我？算了，提意见没人理，想靠合作社又靠不住，要我投资？哼！休想，我把钱扔在凉水里还有个响儿听听！”
    他的妻子回来了，他像是不甚在意地问：“开的什么会？这晚才回来。还不赶快做晚饭！”
   “扩大干部会呗！修改增产计划，动员社员投资。”妻子一边说，一边洗手，准备切菜。
   “我早就知道又是这一套！”时铎还是不大耐烦。
   “我也早就知道您又是这一套；可是这回您错了。”妻子截住他的话，理直气壮地说：“不论什么事情总会有个转变，可您的思想老是不拐弯。前些日子社干部到县上开了会，总结去年的工作，讨论民主办社，社干部在县上都对社里的事情做过检查。今天会上还决定要开社员大会，让大家提意见，接受去年的教训，实行包工包产，把劳动组织和记工分都弄得合理。听刘同志说，县上还要组织老百姓挖河呢！”
   “刘同志？哪个刘同志？”时铎的语气有些软了。
   “就是去年秋天来的那个刘同志，人家也在上面开过会，学习了上级的指示，说第一年办高级社没经验，今年要把去年的缺点纠正过来。刘同志说过几天要组织老农座谈会，研究生产技术，请您也参加。过一会刘同志还要来看您呢！”
    时铎楞了一阵，没有再说什么。不过他显然轻松多了。他站起来，把玻璃窗里面那层纸窗扇打开，屋子里豁然亮起来了。然后，他走下地，背着手看一会妻子切菜，到院子里转个圈儿，又走进来，轻声问妻子：“您，做什么饭？”
   “熬豆腐白菜呗！”妻子抬眼望望他，又低头切着菜。
   “那，那橱子里不是还有点鱼吗，一会刘同志来了留下他吃晚饭吧，嗯？”
    妻子笑了。她趁时铎高兴的时候，便又问道：“社里动员投资，您想，没资金咋生产，柜抽屉那钱，我看，时下还是别买棺材板啦，您说呢？”
   “嗯，棺材板，实对您说，我心里压根就没打谱今年买。不过投资嘛，唔！别忙，等等再说吧，我还得看看他们做的是不是真像那么回事哩！”
