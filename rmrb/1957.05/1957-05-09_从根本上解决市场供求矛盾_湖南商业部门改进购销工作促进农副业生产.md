Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 8th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Houren reports: Hunan Province's commercial departments are vigorously organizing farmers to develop agricultural and sideline production through rural purchasing and marketing work, in order to fundamentally resolve the contradiction between market supply and demand.

After studying how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, many commercial workers in Hunan Province have deeply realized that the most fundamental way to solve the contradiction between market supply and demand is to improve rural purchasing and marketing work and correct the tendency to only care about market needs and not production. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, cadres and farmers lack experience in organizing collective production. Commercial departments are directly facing production and consumers, are familiar with the laws of market supply and demand, and are in a position to assist production departments in doing a good job in agricultural and sideline production. However, in the past, some commercial departments did not have a sufficient understanding of the point that commercial work should serve production. Therefore, the purely business viewpoint of only caring about market needs and not production was relatively common in purchasing and marketing work. For example, last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Ningxiang, Wangcheng, Changsha and other counties saw that brown coir fiber products sold well in the market and had high profits, so they purchased large quantities at high prices. As a result, some agricultural cooperative members abandoned agricultural production and specialized in making brown coir fiber products. Some even dismantled rain capes to make brown coir fiber products, and many palm trees were stripped to death. In order to over fulfill the tea purchase task, some blindly mobilized farmers to pick autumn tea in large quantities, resulting in excessive picking of tea trees and affecting this year's tea production with the risk of decline. Some native and special products such as gallnuts, white chrysanthemums and other Chinese medicinal materials and other products, because the purchase price was too low or the grade was suppressed, resulted in reduced production and income.

In order to implement the spirit of commercial work serving production, Hunan Province's commercial departments are further promoting farmers to develop production through purchasing and marketing activities. The Provincial Service Department has made a plan to develop non-staple food production, decided to establish pig breeding bases near large cities and along transportation lines, and allocated an additional 5 million yuan to pre-purchase live pigs, citrus, and native sugar to help farmers solve the financial difficulties in non-staple food production. The provincial supply and marketing cooperative system has also sent a large number of cadres to rural areas to help agricultural cooperatives in various places to develop diversified operations.

In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also appropriately adjusted the purchase prices of some agricultural and sideline products, and according to contracts, organized 21,854 peddlers to go to the countryside during the spring plowing season to deliver the means of production and livelihood needed by farmers, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers.

With the specific assistance of supply and marketing cooperatives, various agricultural cooperatives have become active in various agricultural and sideline production activities. In the hilly areas of Changsha, Wangcheng, and Liling, more than 2,600 mu of jute, ramie, and Atractylodes macrocephala, which the state needs most, have been expanded through contracts, 100,000 palm trees have been planted, and the production of mulberry trees and native paper has also been developed. In the mountainous areas of Wugang, Shaoyang, and Shaodong, more than 140,000 lacquer trees and palm trees, as well as tung trees, paulownia trees, and yams, have been planted according to local production characteristics. Xiangtan and Qianyang special districts have also established hatching rooms in various places. The Xiangtan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to incubate 2.5 million ducklings and goslings to supply to farmers. It is estimated that after these ducks and geese grow up, they can increase the income of farmers by more than 2 million yuan.

    从根本上解决市场供求矛盾
    湖南商业部门改进购销工作促进农副业生产
    据新华社长沙8日电　新华社记者罗厚仁报道：湖南省商业部门正通过农村购销工作大力组织农民发展农副业生产，以便从根本上解决市场供求的矛盾。
    湖南省许多商业工作人员在学习了如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题以后，深刻地体会到要解决市场供求矛盾，最根本的办法是要改进农村购销工作，纠正只顾市场需要、不管生产的偏向。特别是农业合作化以后，干部和农民都缺乏组织集体生产的经验，商业部门是直接和生产、消费者见面的，熟悉市场供求规律，有条件协助生产部门搞好农副业生产。但是，过去有些商业部门由于对商业工作应为生产服务这一点认识不足，因而在购销工作中比较普遍地存在着只顾市场需要、不管生产的单纯业务观点。例如去年宁乡、望城、长沙等县供销合作部门见市场棕棚销路好、利润大，就高价大量收购，结果使得有些农业社员放弃农业生产专门做棕棚去了，有的甚至把蓑衣拆掉来做棕棚，许多棕树也被剥死了。有的为了超额完成茶叶收购任务，盲目发动农民大量采摘秋茶，以致茶树采摘过度，影响到今年茶叶有减产的危险。有些土特产如五棓子、白菊等中药材和其他产品，因收购价格太低或压级压价，结果减产减收。
    为了贯彻商业工作为生产服务的精神，目前湖南省商业部门正在进一步通过购销活动，大力扶植农民发展生产。省服务厅已经作出发展副食品生产的规划，决定在大城市附近和交通沿线建立养猪基地，并且增拨五百万元预购生猪、柑橘、土糖，以帮助农民解决副食品生产的资金困难。省供销合作系统也派出大批干部深入农村，帮助各地农业社开展多种经营。
    此外，各地供销合作社还适当调整了一些农副产品的收购价格，并根据合同在春耕农忙时期组织了二万一千八百五十四副货郎担下乡，把农民需要的生产生活资料送上门去，受到农民热烈欢迎。
    各地农业社在供销合作部门的具体帮助下，各项农副业生产已经活跃起来。在长沙、望城、醴陵等丘陵地区，就通过合同扩种了国家最需要的黄麻、苧麻、白术二千六百多亩，栽植棕树十万株，还发展了桑树、土纸等生产。在武冈、邵阳、邵东等山区，也根据当地生产特点种植了漆树、棕树十四万多株，以及油桐、梧桐、山药等品种。湘潭、黔阳专区还在各地普遍建立孵房。湘潭专区供销社计划孵育小鸭、小鹅二百五十万只供应农民，预计这批鸭鹅长大后，可以为农民增加收入二百多万元。
