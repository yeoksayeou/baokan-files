Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 5th: More than one hundred public figures from various ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province's four border ethnic autonomous prefectures (districts) gathered in Kunming to enthusiastically discuss Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, in light of the specific conditions of their local areas.

During the discussion, everyone analyzed the internal contradictions among the people in the border ethnic areas and prepared some proposals for resolving these contradictions. Some pointed out that after the completion of peaceful consultation on land reform in the border areas, most ethnic upper-class figures have been properly arranged for, and some have participated in the work of autonomous organs or consultative organs. The majority of them agree with the Party's policies and are willing to serve the people of all ethnic groups. However, another situation that currently exists is that some upper-class figures feel that they have nothing to do or very little to do in their positions, and some even feel that they have the title but no power, making it difficult to play their role. In each autonomous prefecture (district), some upper-class figures who participate in work spend most of their time at home except for attending meetings. Everyone believes that in most cases, this is because the local Party committees do not provide enough help to them, so that these upper-class figures lack the ability to act in accordance with the Party's policies and do not know how to start their work. Another situation is that certain Party cadres do not show enough respect and support for some upper-class figures who hold leadership positions, and do not consult them enough on matters, resulting in some people having the title but no power. Some also believe that the difficulties in work are partly due to the insufficient subjective efforts of some upper-class figures themselves and the lack of a spirit of hard work in going deep into the masses, which prevents them from gaining the full support of the broad masses. Everyone believes that in the future, they should not only actively fight against bureaucracy and sectarianism, but also strive to transform their thinking and improve their ability to handle affairs with the help of the Party, so as to eliminate their feelings of frustration in their work and play a greater role in future work.

Everyone also criticized some shortcomings in the work of various autonomous prefectures (districts) based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech. Religious figures in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture hope to strengthen education on religious policies for young cadres in order to eliminate phenomena that intentionally or unintentionally interfere with freedom of religious belief. Some representatives from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture believe that the achievements made in the agricultural cooperativization movement in the border areas are significant. This is reflected in the fact that most agricultural cooperatives have increased production. However, the insufficient attention to ethnic characteristics in running cooperatives is one of the main shortcomings at present. The fact that a small number of agricultural cooperative members have requested to withdraw from the cooperatives despite a significant increase in income should be given special attention.

    云南少数民族领袖人物分析边疆内部矛盾
    批评少数党员尊重和支持上层人士不够
    据新华社昆明5日电　云南省四个边疆民族自治州（区）的一百多名各民族公众领袖人物齐集昆明，结合当地具体情况热烈讨论了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话。
    在讨论中，大家对于边疆民族地区的人民内部矛盾作了分析，并为解决这些矛盾问题准备了一些提案。有人指出，边疆地区在完成和平协商土地改革以后，绝大部分民族上层人士已经得到适当的安排，有些已参加自治机关或协商机关的工作，其中多数人赞成党的政策，愿意为各族人民服务。但是，目前存在的另一情况是，部分上层人士在工作岗位上感到无事可做或事情很少，有的甚至感到有职无权，难以发挥自己的作用。在各自治州（区）都有一些参加工作的上层人士除参加会议外，多数时间住在自己家里。大家认为在多数情况下是因为当地党委对他们的帮助不够，以致这些上层人士缺乏按照党的政策办事的能力，在工作中不知如何着手。另一种情况是，某些党员干部对一些担任领导职务的上层人士尊重和支持不够，遇事商量不够，形成一些人有职无权。还有人认为，由于某些上层人士自己的主观努力不够，缺乏深入群众的艰苦精神，因而得不到广大群众的充分支持，也是造成工作困难的原因之一。大家认为，今后应该一面积极同那些官僚主义，宗派主义作风作斗争，一面在党的帮助下努力进行思想改造，提高办事能力，才能消除自己工作中的苦闷情绪，在今后工作中发挥更大的作用。
    大家还根据毛主席讲话的精神，对各自治州（区）工作中的一些缺点提出批评。怒江傈僳族自治区的宗教界人士希望加强对青年干部宗教政策的教育，以消除那些有意无意地干涉了信仰自由的现象。德宏傣族景颇族自治州和西双版纳傣族自治州的一些代表们认为，边疆地区的农业合作化运动取得的成绩是显著的。这表现在绝大部分农业社增加了生产。但是，办社中注意民族特点不够，是当前的主要缺点之一。有少数农业社社员在显著增加收入的情况下要求退社，这一情况应该引起特别注意。
