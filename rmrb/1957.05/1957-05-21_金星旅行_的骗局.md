    The "Venus Trip" Scam
    Not long ago, a con man appeared in Washington who swindled Miss Boning Garber, an old maid, out of $40,000 under the pretext of raising funds for a trip to Venus.
    This con man's name was Harold Barney. He once told Miss Boning that he would travel to Venus for two weeks in a flying saucer, and upon his return, he would ask her to transcribe his "Venus Travelogue." Under numerous sweet words, he ran away with all of Miss Boning's savings and "went to Venus." Shortly after, a small package was supposedly sent from Venus to Harold Barney's wife. Inside the package was a "letter from a Venusian," saying that Harold Barney had died while traveling on Venus. The package contained his personal effects: a camera, wallet, letters, etc. These arrangements were intended to make Miss Boning despair. However, because this con man never left Earth, he was finally exposed.

    “金星旅行”的骗局
    不久前，华盛顿曾出现一个骗子，用筹集到金星旅行资金的名义，骗取了老处女包宁·高蓓小姐四万美金。
    这个骗子名叫哈劳德·巴尼，他曾经告诉包宁小姐说要乘飞碟到金星去作两个星期的旅行，回来后将请她誊写他的“金星见闻录”。在许许多多的甜言蜜语之下，他卷走了包宁小姐的一切积蓄而“前往金星”去了。不久之后，据说是从金星上寄来了一个给哈劳德·巴尼妻子的小包裹，包裹里面有一封“金星人的信”，说哈劳德·巴尼已经在金星上旅行中死亡了。包裹寄来了他的遗物照相机、钱包、信件等等，这些安排是企图使包宁小姐绝望。可是，由于这位骗子根本就没有离开地球，终于被人揭发了。
