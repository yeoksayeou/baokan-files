Since the formal restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, cultural exchanges and friendly interactions between the two countries are actively unfolding.

According to Japanese newspaper reports: A Soviet friendly delegation of economic, scientific, and cultural circles, headed by M. Nesterov, Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce, will arrive in Japan soon at the invitation of the Japan Asia Solidarity Committee. Members of the delegation include academicians of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, professors of industry and agriculture, economists, poets, etc. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan established a welcoming committee headed by former Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on May 8 and are actively preparing for the welcome.

The Soviet government announced on May 4 that the ballet troupe of the Bolshoi Theatre of the Soviet Union has accepted Japan’s invitation and will perform in Tokyo and Osaka for a month starting August 28. The troupe consists of approximately 50 people, including Soviet People’s Artist Lepeshinskaya and other ballet experts. They are scheduled to perform Swan Lake, The Fountain of Bakhchisarai, and other repertoires in Japan.

The famous Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg concluded his friendly visit to Japan and returned to his country on May 4. During his nearly one-month stay, he visited several cities in Japan, held discussions with local Japanese writers, and delivered lectures at universities and literary organizations.

The Soviet trade union delegation, which arrived in Tokyo on April 7 at the invitation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, paid a friendly visit to Japan for about three weeks. They visited the industrial zone in Hokkaido and visited factories and mines in Osaka, Kobe, Niigata, and many other cities. They were warmly and cordially welcomed by the working people in various parts of Japan. On April 27, the Soviet trade union delegation and representatives of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan signed a joint communiqué in Tokyo. The communiqué emphasized the need to develop mutual visits of trade union delegations and expand the exchange of books and films. Both sides agreed that it is necessary to comprehensively promote the development of trade relations and economic cooperation between the two countries and resolved to jointly fight for peaceful coexistence between countries with different socio-economic systems and for the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet Puppet Theater is scheduled to perform in Japan in October. Soviet composer Shostakovich and pianist Gilels will also visit Japan successively. The Japanese "Kabuki-za" has been invited to perform in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev around September. Japanese dance troupes and Japanese puppet theaters are also scheduled to perform in the Soviet Union this autumn. The Japanese Fine Arts and Crafts Exhibition and the Japanese Book Exhibition will be exhibited in major cities such as Moscow in July.

In addition, the Soviet film "Ivan Susanin" and the ballet film "Bright Stream," which were released in Japan in March, were warmly welcomed by Japanese audiences. Soviet films recently released in Japan also include "The Fall of Berlin," "Romeo and Juliet," "The Stone Flower," "Othello," "Swan Lake," etc., which have been highly praised by Japanese audiences.

With the growing desire to understand the Soviet Union, the Japanese people's interest in learning Russian is increasing. The Russian Department of the National Tokyo University of Foreign Studies only enrolled 40 new students last year, but more than 600 people applied for the examination. Currently, the number of people studying Russian in various universities and colleges is more than 2,200. There are also short-term Russian language classes in various cities, and more than 1,000 people study in such classes run by the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association every year.

Many newly published Soviet books have been quickly translated into Japanese and introduced to Japan. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also translating Japanese literary masterpieces, both ancient and modern, such as The Tale of Genji, Complete Works of Saikaku, Selected Works of Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Collection of Takuboku Poems, Short Stories of Ryunosuke Akutagawa and Yuriko Miyamoto, Ito Sei's "The Phoenix," Ishikawa Tatsuzo's "Wandering Reeds," and others.

The direct telephone line between Tokyo and Moscow, which began operating on the 22nd of last month, has created new and favorable conditions for friendly ties between the Soviet Union and Japan in the future.

    苏日两国正式恢复邦交以来  友好往来频繁文化交流活跃
    本报讯　据日本报纸消息：苏日正式恢复邦交以来，两国间的文化交流和友好往来正在积极展开。
    由苏联商会主席米·涅斯捷罗夫担任团长的苏联经济、科学、文化界的友好访日代表团，应日本亚洲团结委员会的邀请，即将在最近到达日本。参加代表团的成员有苏联科学院院士、工业和农业教授、经济学者、诗人等。日本各界著名人士已经在本月8日成立了以前首相鸠山一郎为主席的欢迎委员会，积极准备欢迎。
    苏联政府本月4日宣布，苏联大剧院的巴蕾舞蹈团已经接受了日本的邀请，将从8月28日起在东京和大阪作为期一个月的访问演出。剧团约五十人，其中包括苏联人民演员列别辛斯卡娅等巴蕾舞专家，预定在日本演出天鹅湖、巴赫切莎拉伊宫的水泉等等剧目。
    苏联名作家爱伦堡已经结束了他在日本的友好访问，于5月4日返国。他在近一个月期间，先后在日本好几个城市进行了访问，和当地的日本作家举行了座谈，在大学和文学团体等处发表了讲演。
    应日本工会总评议会的邀请于4月7日到达东京的苏联工会代表团，在日本进行了为时约三周的友好访问。他们参观了北海道的工业区、访问了大阪、神户、新澙和其他许多城市的工厂和矿山。他们受到了日本各地劳动人民非常热情和亲切的欢迎。4月27日，苏联工会代表团和日本工会总评议会代表在东京签署了联合公报。公报强调了发展工会代表团的互相访问、扩大书籍和影片的交换的必要，双方一致认为必须全面促进两国贸易关系和经济合作的发展，决心为不同社会经济制度国家的和平共处和完全禁止原子武器、氢武器而共同斗争。
    苏联木偶剧团预定在10月间到日本公演。苏联作曲家萧斯塔柯维奇、钢琴家基列尔斯也将先后访问日本。日本“歌舞伎座”应邀在9月前后去莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅作访问演出。日本舞蹈团、日本傀儡剧团也预定在今年秋天到苏联演出。日本美术工艺展览会、日本书籍展览会将于7月间在莫斯科等大城市展出。
    此外，3月间在日本上映的苏联影片“伊凡·苏萨宁”和巴蕾舞影片“光明”，受到了日本观众热烈欢迎。不久前在日本上映的苏联影片还有“攻克柏林”、“罗密欧与幽丽叶”、“宝石花”、“奥赛罗”、“天鹅湖”等等，日本观众给予这些影片极高的评价。
    随着要求了解苏联意愿的增长，日本人民学习俄语的兴趣日趋浓厚。日本国立东京外语大学俄语科去年只招收四十名新生，而报名投考的竟有六百多人。现在在各大学和高等学校学习俄语的人数在二千二百人以上。各城市还设有短期的俄语学习班，在日苏亲善协会所办的这种学习班中学习的每年有一千多人。
    许多苏联新出版的书籍被迅速译成了日文介绍到日本。同时，苏联也正在翻译日本的源氏物语、西鹤全集、近松门左卫门选集、啄木诗集、芥川龙之介和宫本百合子的短篇集、伊藤整的“不死鸟”、石川达三的“随风飘荡的芦苇”等古今文学名作。
    东京和莫斯科之间在上月22日开始直通电话后，更为今后苏日两国的友好联系创造了新的优越条件。
