Comrades, Friends, Honored Guests:

Today, we gather here to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

On behalf of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the people of all nationalities in the region, I extend a warm welcome and high respect to Vice Premier Li Xiannian, the representative of the Central Government, and the representatives of relevant departments of the State Council, to the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Comrade Sürenjav and all members of the art and sports troupe, to the Soviet and other fraternal countries' experts who are helping us with construction, and to the representatives of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and various provinces, cities, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties.

We express our utmost gratitude for the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Mongolian people and all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have, after ten years of struggle, shaken off national and class oppression; ended the three-hundred-year state of division, and formed a unified autonomous region; the economic and cultural undertakings have made great progress, and the region is transitioning from an economically and culturally backward nation to a socialist modern nation. The tragic situation of long-term oppression and division of the Inner Mongolian nation, economic decline, widespread illiteracy, and population decline will never return.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely uniting with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, especially the Han nationality, jointly opposing common enemies, overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule; adhering to the policy of national regional autonomy of the Chinese Communist Party; gradually carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformation within the nation; restoring and developing economic and cultural undertakings, and gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of developing production. This is the only correct path for the liberation, development, and prosperity of the Mongolian people of Inner Mongolia. This is the victory of the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party.

The unity of the Mongolian, Han, and other fraternal nationalities in Inner Mongolia is an important condition for the victory of the people's revolution in Inner Mongolia and the great achievements in the socialist construction of the autonomous region. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the motherland. The Mongolians, Hans, and other fraternal nationalities have jointly created and developed Inner Mongolia's political economy and culture, jointly carried out revolutionary struggles, and are jointly carrying out socialist construction. Their common ideals and interests have formed a close alliance and brotherly friendship. It is precisely because of the unity among the people of all nationalities that the common and powerful enemy was eliminated, national oppression was eliminated, and the realization of unified regional autonomy and all other achievements were possible. The tasks of socialist construction and safeguarding the motherland require continuous strengthening of unity among nationalities. In order to further develop unity among nationalities, it is necessary to further strengthen patriotic education and internationalist education among the people of all nationalities, and further overcome the remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and first of all, overcome the remnants of Han chauvinism. In order to further develop national unity, it is necessary to always pay attention to the characteristics and specific requirements of all nationalities, and to develop their economic and cultural undertakings based on these characteristics and requirements. We welcome the Han people to give the Mongolian people multifaceted assistance; we will also help the minority nationalities in the region to develop their economic and cultural undertakings in the same way that the Han people help the Mongolian people. All fraternal nationalities in the region will further play their due role in the socialist construction of the autonomous region.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that the continuous consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front is an important condition for achieving various achievements in the autonomous region. People from all strata have made beneficial contributions to various undertakings in the autonomous region. After the decisive victory of socialist transformation, the unity of people from all strata has been further consolidated and developed on a new basis. The tasks of socialist construction require this unity to be further consolidated and developed, and require people from all strata to further display their enthusiasm and creativity. In order to further strengthen the unity of the people internally, it is necessary to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Only in the process of correctly and continuously resolving these contradictions can the level of awareness of people from all strata be continuously improved, can the unity of the people be continuously consolidated and developed, and can the tremendous potential for building socialism hidden among people from all strata be brought into play. In order to correctly resolve contradictions among the people and further strengthen the unity of the people, it is necessary to implement the policy of starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism or struggle, and reaching new unity on a new basis, it is necessary to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in leadership work, it is necessary to adhere to the style of seeking truth from facts, conducting investigations and research, sharing weal and woe with the masses, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work among the people, it is necessary to be good at using persuasive education methods to solve ideological problems among the people, and it is necessary to correctly implement various policies and earnestly solve practical problems among the masses.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that, under the guidance of the national unified policies and guidelines, formulating specific policies and working methods based on the national characteristics and regional characteristics of the autonomous region is an important condition for ensuring the realization of unified policies and guidelines and ensuring the smooth progress of various undertakings. In this regard, we have successful experiences and lessons of failure. Today, our understanding of the characteristics of the autonomous region in socialist construction is still incomplete and not deep enough. The task of socialist construction requires us to be good at further combining the laws of socialist construction and the national unified policies and guidelines with the characteristics of the autonomous region, and requires us to continuously overcome subjectivism and dogmatism.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that cultivating cadres of the Mongolian nationality and various nationalities is an important condition for ensuring the development of various tasks. In order to meet the needs of socialist construction, especially modern industrial construction, it has become an important task of the autonomous region's construction to cultivate technical talents and enterprise management cadres of the Mongolian nationality and various nationalities in a planned way.

The ten years of autonomy in Inner Mongolia have been ten years of profound changes in the face of the Mongolian nationality in Inner Mongolia. However, this change is only the beginning for a backward nation to develop towards a nation with a high level of economic culture. This change has provided us with the social and material conditions for planned economic and cultural development; however, at present, the economy and culture are still backward. To fundamentally change this situation requires long-term and arduous efforts.

This year is the last year of the first five-year plan. In socialist construction, we have made tremendous achievements, but there are also many shortcomings and errors. Most of these shortcomings and errors are caused by lack of experience. We should summarize the experiences and lessons in various aspects of socialist construction in the autonomous region. Both successful experiences and lessons of failure are our valuable assets and valuable materials for our study, and we must summarize and study them well. Learning these experiences and lessons well will enable us to carry out socialist construction work more effectively. We want to study, study, and study again. We must study the central government's instructions well; we must study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in building socialism; we must study the advanced experience of fraternal provinces and regions; we must be good at combining these advanced experiences with the actual situation in the autonomous region; we must be good at learning from the broad masses of the people. As long as we correctly grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, are modest and prudent, study diligently, and are good at learning, we will surely be able to accumulate relatively mature experience. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we will surely be able to successfully build a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Long live the great unity of the working people of the world!

Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people!

Long live the great family of nationalities in China—the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live Marxism-Leninism!

    乌兰夫主席的讲话
    敬爱的来宾们、朋友们、同志们：
    今天，我们大家来庆祝“五一”国际劳动节和内蒙古自治区成立十周年。
    我代表内蒙古自治区人民委员会和全区各民族人民向以中央代表李先念副总理和国务院有关部门的代表们，向以苏伦扎布同志为首的蒙古人民共和国代表们及艺术体育团全体团员，向帮助我们建设的苏联和其他兄弟国家的专家们，向新疆维吾尔自治区、西藏自治区筹备委员会、各省、市、自治州、自治县的代表，表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    对中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛泽东主席的正确领导，表示万分的感谢。
    内蒙古自治区蒙古民族和区内各民族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，经过了十年的斗争，摆脱了民族压迫和阶级压迫；结束了三百年来的分割状态，形成了统一的自治区；经济文化事业有了巨大的发展，正由一个经济文化落后的民族向着社会主义的现代民族过渡。内蒙古民族长期被压迫被分割、经济衰弱、文盲众多、人口下降的悲惨景象一去不复返了。
    在中国共产党的领导下，与祖国各兄弟民族特别是汉族紧密团结，共同反对共同的敌人，推翻国民党反动统治；坚持执行中国共产党的民族区域自治政策；逐步进行民族内部的民主改革和社会主义改造；恢复和发展经济文化事业，在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民的物质文化生活水平。这是内蒙古蒙古民族取得解放、发展、繁荣的唯一正确的道路。这是中国共产党伟大民族政策的胜利。
    内蒙古蒙古民族和汉族及其它各兄弟民族的团结，是内蒙古人民革命取得胜利和自治区社会主义建设取得伟大成就的重要条件。内蒙古自治区是祖国不可分割的一部分。蒙汉及其他兄弟民族共同缔造和发展了内蒙古政治经济文化，共同进行革命斗争，共同进行着社会主义建设。他们共同的理想和利益使他们结成了亲密的同盟和兄弟般的友谊。正是有了各民族人民间的团结，才消灭了共同的强大的敌人，消灭了民族压迫，才有统一的区域自治的实现和其他一切成就。社会主义建设的任务，保卫祖国的任务，要求民族间的团结不断增强。为了进一步发展民族间的团结，必须在各民族人民间进一步加强爱国主义教育和国际主义教育，进一步克服大民族主义和地方民族主义的残余，首先克服大民族主义的残余。为了进一步发展民族团结，必须经常注意各民族的特点和具体要求，并根据这些特点和要求来发展他们的经济文化事业。我们欢迎汉族人民给蒙古人民以多方面的帮助；我们也像汉族人民帮助蒙古人民一样，来帮助区内各少数民族来发展他们的经济文化事业。区内各兄弟民族将在自治区的社会主义建设中进一步发挥他们应有的作用。
    内蒙古自治区蒙古民族人民所走过的道路表明：人民民主统一战线的不断巩固与发展是取得自治区各项成就的重要条件。各阶层人民在自治区的各项事业中都做了有益的贡献。在社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利之后，各阶层人民的团结又在新的基础上进一步巩固和发展起来。社会主义建设的任务，要求这种团结更加巩固和发展，要求各阶层人民进一步发挥他们的积极性与创造性。为了进一步加强人民内部的团结，必须正确处理人民内部的矛盾。只有在正确地不断地解决这种矛盾的过程中，才能使各阶层人民的觉悟程度不断提高，才能使人民团结不断巩固和发展，才能把隐藏在各阶层人民中建设社会主义的巨大潜力发挥出来。为了正确解决人民内部矛盾，进一步加强人民团结，必须执行从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结的方针，必须克服领导工作中的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，必须坚持实事求是调查研究，与群众同甘共苦的作风，必须加强人民群众中的政治思想工作，必须善于用说服教育的方法来解决人民中间的思想问题，必须正确地执行各项政策，认真地解决群众中的实际问题。
    内蒙古自治区蒙古民族人民所走过的道路表明：在国家统一的方针政策的指导下，根据自治区民族特点和地区特点规定一些具体政策和工作方法，是保证统一的方针政策的实现，保证各种事业顺利进行的重要条件，在这方面，我们有成功经验，也有失败教训。今天我们对社会主义建设中的自治区的特点还了解得不全不深。社会主义建设任务，要求我们善于把社会主义建设规律，把国家统一方针政策与自治区的特点进一步结合起来，要求我们不断地克服主观主义、教条主义。
    内蒙古自治区蒙古民族人民所走过的道路表明：培养蒙古民族和各民族干部是保证各种工作发展的重要条件。为了适应社会主义建设特别是现代工业建设的要求，有计划地培养蒙古民族及各民族的技术人才和企业管理干部，就成为自治区建设的一项重要任务。
    内蒙古自治的十年，是内蒙古蒙古民族面貌发生深刻变化的十年。但是，这个变化，对一个落后民族向着有高度经济文化水平的民族发展来说还是事情的开始。这个变化使我们具备了有计划地发展经济文化的社会条件和物质条件；但是目前，经济文化还仍然是落后的。要根本改变这种情况，还要作长期的艰苦的努力。
    今年是第一个五年计划的最后一年。在社会主义建设中，我们取得了巨大成就，但也有许多缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误，绝大部分是因为没有经验所造成的。我们应该总结自治区进行社会主义建设各方面的经验教训，无论是成功的经验和失败的教训，都是我们的宝贵财产，都是我们学习的宝贵资料，要很好地总结它、研究它。学习好这些经验教训，就会使我们更有效地进行社会主义建设工作。我们要学习，学习，再学习。我们要很好地学习中央的指示；我们要学习苏联和其他兄弟国家建设社会主义的先进经验；要学习各兄弟省、区的先进经验；我们要善于把这些先进经验与自治区实际结合起来；我们要善于向广大人民群众学习。只要我们正确掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，谦虚谨慎，刻苦钻研，善于学习，我们一定能够积累起比较成熟的经验。在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，我们一定能够顺利建成社会主义的内蒙古自治区。
    全世界劳动人民大团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大团结万岁！
    中蒙两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国各民族大家庭——中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
