Comrades, Friends, Honored Guests:

Today, we gather here to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

On behalf of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the people of all nationalities in the region, I extend a warm welcome and high respect to Vice Premier Li Xiannian, the representative of the Central Government, and the representatives of relevant departments of the State Council, to the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic headed by Comrade SÃ¼renjav and all members of the art and sports troupe, to the Soviet and other fraternal countries' experts who are helping us with construction, and to the representatives of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and various provinces, cities, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties.

We express our utmost gratitude for the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Mongolian people and all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have, after ten years of struggle, shaken off national and class oppression; ended the three-hundred-year state of division, and formed a unified autonomous region; the economic and cultural undertakings have made great progress, and the region is transitioning from an economically and culturally backward nation to a socialist modern nation. The tragic situation of long-term oppression and division of the Inner Mongolian nation, economic decline, widespread illiteracy, and population decline will never return.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely uniting with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, especially the Han nationality, jointly opposing common enemies, overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule; adhering to the policy of national regional autonomy of the Chinese Communist Party; gradually carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformation within the nation; restoring and developing economic and cultural undertakings, and gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of developing production. This is the only correct path for the liberation, development, and prosperity of the Mongolian people of Inner Mongolia. This is the victory of the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party.

The unity of the Mongolian, Han, and other fraternal nationalities in Inner Mongolia is an important condition for the victory of the people's revolution in Inner Mongolia and the great achievements in the socialist construction of the autonomous region. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the motherland. The Mongolians, Hans, and other fraternal nationalities have jointly created and developed Inner Mongolia's political economy and culture, jointly carried out revolutionary struggles, and are jointly carrying out socialist construction. Their common ideals and interests have formed a close alliance and brotherly friendship. It is precisely because of the unity among the people of all nationalities that the common and powerful enemy was eliminated, national oppression was eliminated, and the realization of unified regional autonomy and all other achievements were possible. The tasks of socialist construction and safeguarding the motherland require continuous strengthening of unity among nationalities. In order to further develop unity among nationalities, it is necessary to further strengthen patriotic education and internationalist education among the people of all nationalities, and further overcome the remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and first of all, overcome the remnants of Han chauvinism. In order to further develop national unity, it is necessary to always pay attention to the characteristics and specific requirements of all nationalities, and to develop their economic and cultural undertakings based on these characteristics and requirements. We welcome the Han people to give the Mongolian people multifaceted assistance; we will also help the minority nationalities in the region to develop their economic and cultural undertakings in the same way that the Han people help the Mongolian people. All fraternal nationalities in the region will further play their due role in the socialist construction of the autonomous region.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that the continuous consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front is an important condition for achieving various achievements in the autonomous region. People from all strata have made beneficial contributions to various undertakings in the autonomous region. After the decisive victory of socialist transformation, the unity of people from all strata has been further consolidated and developed on a new basis. The tasks of socialist construction require this unity to be further consolidated and developed, and require people from all strata to further display their enthusiasm and creativity. In order to further strengthen the unity of the people internally, it is necessary to correctly handle contradictions among the people. Only in the process of correctly and continuously resolving these contradictions can the level of awareness of people from all strata be continuously improved, can the unity of the people be continuously consolidated and developed, and can the tremendous potential for building socialism hidden among people from all strata be brought into play. In order to correctly resolve contradictions among the people and further strengthen the unity of the people, it is necessary to implement the policy of starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism or struggle, and reaching new unity on a new basis, it is necessary to overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in leadership work, it is necessary to adhere to the style of seeking truth from facts, conducting investigations and research, sharing weal and woe with the masses, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work among the people, it is necessary to be good at using persuasive education methods to solve ideological problems among the people, and it is necessary to correctly implement various policies and earnestly solve practical problems among the masses.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that, under the guidance of the national unified policies and guidelines, formulating specific policies and working methods based on the national characteristics and regional characteristics of the autonomous region is an important condition for ensuring the realization of unified policies and guidelines and ensuring the smooth progress of various undertakings. In this regard, we have successful experiences and lessons of failure. Today, our understanding of the characteristics of the autonomous region in socialist construction is still incomplete and not deep enough. The task of socialist construction requires us to be good at further combining the laws of socialist construction and the national unified policies and guidelines with the characteristics of the autonomous region, and requires us to continuously overcome subjectivism and dogmatism.

The path taken by the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shows that cultivating cadres of the Mongolian nationality and various nationalities is an important condition for ensuring the development of various tasks. In order to meet the needs of socialist construction, especially modern industrial construction, it has become an important task of the autonomous region's construction to cultivate technical talents and enterprise management cadres of the Mongolian nationality and various nationalities in a planned way.

The ten years of autonomy in Inner Mongolia have been ten years of profound changes in the face of the Mongolian nationality in Inner Mongolia. However, this change is only the beginning for a backward nation to develop towards a nation with a high level of economic culture. This change has provided us with the social and material conditions for planned economic and cultural development; however, at present, the economy and culture are still backward. To fundamentally change this situation requires long-term and arduous efforts.

This year is the last year of the first five-year plan. In socialist construction, we have made tremendous achievements, but there are also many shortcomings and errors. Most of these shortcomings and errors are caused by lack of experience. We should summarize the experiences and lessons in various aspects of socialist construction in the autonomous region. Both successful experiences and lessons of failure are our valuable assets and valuable materials for our study, and we must summarize and study them well. Learning these experiences and lessons well will enable us to carry out socialist construction work more effectively. We want to study, study, and study again. We must study the central government's instructions well; we must study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in building socialism; we must study the advanced experience of fraternal provinces and regions; we must be good at combining these advanced experiences with the actual situation in the autonomous region; we must be good at learning from the broad masses of the people. As long as we correctly grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, are modest and prudent, study diligently, and are good at learning, we will surely be able to accumulate relatively mature experience. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we will surely be able to successfully build a socialist Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Long live the great unity of the working people of the world!

Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people!

Long live the great family of nationalities in Chinaâthe People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live Marxism-Leninism!
