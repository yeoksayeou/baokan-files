    First Day of Physical Labor
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang, 7th) Today, the factory director, Party Secretary, and 19 other leading comrades from the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant joined the workers in starting their first day of physical labor for this year. For the main workshops, such as the iron casting and forging shops, today was a day for rectifying the working environment. As soon as these leading comrades entered the workshops, they joined various worker groups and worked under the direction of the worker group leaders.

    Factory Director Tian Guang was a farmer before 1938 and has not engaged in physical labor for more than ten years since joining the revolution. Today, he took off his coat and dug soil alongside the workers. Deputy Party Secretary Guo Xiuye displayed the energy he had during the Great Production Movement in Yan'an, carrying sand and soil with the workers. Chief Designer Dong Liangchen and Technology Section Chief Ding Fuchen, one a college graduate and the other a milling worker, immediately started assembling the gas generator distributor themselves upon meeting the workers. The relatively younger among these leading comrades was Zhao Xiting, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, who used to be a foundry worker but has been working as a leader away from physical labor for four years. The one who had been away from physical labor for the longest time was Deputy Factory Director and Chief Engineer Zhi Bingyuan, who is already sixty-one years old this year and has gray hair. However, he organized the sand molds very seriously, which greatly moved many workers. The workers repeatedly suggested that the leading comrades do lighter work and expressed that they would put in more effort in production in the future.

    The workday ended. Some leading comrades felt a bit tired because they hadn't engaged in physical labor for a long time. But they all excitedly stated that today was their first day participating in physical labor, and in the future, they would establish the practice of going deep into the workshops to participate in physical labor as a regular system, integrate with the workers, and ensure that everyone is not constrained when meeting each other and speaks truthfully.

    第一个体力劳动日
    本报沈阳7日电　今天沈阳矿山机器厂的厂长、党委书记等十九名领导同志，和工人们在一起，开始了今年第一次的体力劳动日。铸铁锻工等主要车间，今天是整顿作业环境的一天。这些领导同志一进车间，就分别参加到各个工人小组中去，由工人组长领导着干活。
    厂长田光1938年前是个农民，参加革命后已有十几年没有从事体力劳动。今天他把衣服脱了，和工人一道刨土。党委副书记郭修业拿出了在延安参加大生产时的劲头，和工人们一道搬运砂土。总设计师董亮忱和工艺科长丁福忱，过去一个是大学生、一个是铣工。今天他们和工人一见面，就自己动手，要把煤气发生炉的分配器装配好。这些领导同志中比较年轻的要算铸铁工人出身的团委书记赵熙亭，但他脱产担任领导工作也有四年了。脱离体力劳动最久的要算副厂长兼总工程师支秉渊，今年他已六十一岁，头发斑白了。可是他整理起砂型来，十分认真，使许多工人很受感动。工人们一再建议领导同志干轻活，并表示今后要在生产中再加一把劲。
    下班了。有的领导同志因为长久没有进行体力劳动，已感到有点累。但他们都兴奋地表示，今天是他们参加体力劳动的第一天，以后要把深入车间参加体力劳动作为经常制度固定下来，要和工人打成一片，做到互相见面不拘束，大家讲真心话。　（文）
