    Explaining the Three Principles of Grain Purchase and Sale to Farmers
    During the spring plowing season last year, some regions, based on the then agricultural production plan, announced to agricultural cooperatives and their members an increase in the grain consumption standards stipulated in the grain "Three Fixes." After the wheat harvest, some regions, in guiding agricultural cooperatives to pre-distribute grain, did not well implement the grain "Three Fixes" policy, one-sidedly emphasizing "more work, more gain," with the result that some agricultural cooperatives pre-distributed too much grain to their members, and in some cooperatives the amount of grain pre-distributed to each household varied greatly. After the autumn harvest, those agricultural cooperatives that did not increase grain production or increased it very little had to lower the consumption standards that they had announced earlier; and they had to use great effort to organize grain adjustments between members of cooperatives who had pre-distributed too much or too little grain. This not only aroused the dissatisfaction of the members and increased the working difficulties of the agricultural cooperatives, but also affected the balance of the state's grain revenue and expenditure, causing passivity in many aspects. This is an extremely important lesson. In the next grain year, in order to avoid repeating this shortcoming, it is now necessary, in conjunction with spring plowing production, to re-propagate the grain "Three Fixes" policy to the broad masses of farmers.
    Based on the new situation after agricultural cooperativization, the current re-propagation of the grain "Three Fixes" policy should focus on explaining three principles.
    The first principle: This year, the agricultural cooperative grain purchase and sale figures will still be determined according to the grain consumption standards stipulated in the "Three Fixes." Although the "Three Fixes" grain consumption standards were determined in 1955 when the small-scale peasant economy still dominated the agricultural economy, they are still largely compatible with China's current grain production and consumption level, and can still guarantee the basic needs of farmers in grain consumption. After agricultural cooperativization, the broad masses of farmers joined agricultural cooperatives, and their labor volume is generally greater than when they were working individually; the number of pigs and other livestock has also increased somewhat; and agricultural cooperatives also want to keep more grain to manage sideline businesses in order to develop the economy in many ways. The farmers' desire to develop the economy is completely understandable. However, because China's current grain production level is still relatively low, large-scale land reclamation cannot be carried out in the short term, and water and drought disasters cannot be eradicated quickly, the rate of production growth is slow, so it is not possible to quickly and fully meet the growing needs of all aspects in grain consumption. Therefore, the improvement of farmers' grain consumption should not be pinned on the state reducing grain purchases or increasing grain sales, which is detrimental to the development of the national economy and the construction of socialist industrialization; rather, it should rely on the agricultural cooperatives themselves to strive to increase grain production. That is to say, the grain consumption standards stipulated by the state during the "Three Fixes" are an important boundary of the state's grain distribution policy, but they are not entirely the actual consumption level of farmers. As long as they are agricultural cooperatives that have increased grain production, the grain they have increased, in addition to completing the state's prescribed increased purchase tasks, can be used to develop production and improve their lives; agricultural cooperatives that have not increased production or have increased it very little will have to temporarily control grain consumption. Only in this way can the imbalance between grain production and consumption be fundamentally prevented, the basic needs of the state and all farmers be guaranteed, and grain production be promoted at the same time.
    The second principle: If the actual grain output of an agricultural cooperative (household) is greater than the fixed output determined during the "Three Fixes," the increased part can be appropriately increased for purchase or correspondingly reduced for sale. Because agricultural production is greatly affected by natural conditions, the abundance or shortage of grain harvests is usually unbalanced between regions and between years. For example, in a bumper year like 1955, there were still some places in the country that suffered from disasters and reduced production. In disaster areas, the state must reduce grain purchases and increase grain sales. At the same time, due to the increase in the urban population, the state's need for commodity grain is also increasing year by year. Therefore, in order to regulate the grain production and demand relationship between regions and between years, and to ensure that socialist construction and industrial and agricultural production can proceed normally even in years of severe disasters, it is necessary to appropriately increase the purchase or reduce the sale of a portion of grain from all agricultural cooperatives (households) that have increased grain production on the basis of the "Three Fixes." As long as the amount of grain purchased does not exceed 40% of the increased part, all cooperatives (households) with a relatively large increase in production will be able to improve their grain consumption to a greater extent. Practice has proved that this principle is completely acceptable to farmers.
    The third principle: When distributing grain, surplus grain cooperatives should "put the state first and the members second." Putting the state first means that the state's assessed grain purchase task must be completed first. Putting the members second means that the grain consumption of the cooperative and its members can only be improved after this task is completed. The basic spirit of "putting the state first and the members second" is to guarantee the basic needs of the state, the agricultural cooperative, and all its members for grain. It must be pointed out that under the condition that the basis of the "Three Fixes" remains unchanged, there is no contradiction between completing the state's assessed grain purchase task and ensuring the basic needs of the agricultural cooperative and all its members for grain consumption. The order of priority referred to in "putting the state first and the members second" is essentially based on ensuring the basic needs of the agricultural cooperative and all its members for grain consumption. According to this principle, the specific order of grain distribution in an agricultural cooperative is: first, retain enough seeds and feed for draft animals, and distribute basic rations and pig feed to all members according to the grain consumption standards stipulated in the "Three Fixes." Second, complete the state's assessed grain purchase task. Finally, according to the cooperative's surplus grain situation, make every effort to take care of other needs. It should be repeatedly explained that if an agricultural cooperative increases grain production a lot, it is completely reasonable to distribute more grain to ordinary members, to distribute more grain to those members who are strong in labor and work more, or to use more grain to manage sideline businesses. However, the above order must be strictly observed in the actual distribution of grain.
    The above three principles embody the spirit of the grain "Three Fixes" policy. They are several important key issues in continuing to implement the grain "Three Fixes" policy after agricultural cooperativization, and they are also the issues that the broad masses of farmers are most concerned about. All localities must carry out in-depth publicity during spring plowing production.

    向农民说明购销粮食的三条原则
    去年春耕期间，有些地区根据当时的农业生产规划，向农业社和社员宣布提高粮食“三定”时规定的用粮标准。麦收以后，有些地区指导农业社预分粮食，没有很好地贯彻执行粮食“三定”政策，片面地强调“多劳多得”，以致有的农业社预分给社员的粮食过多，有的社各户社员预分的粮食多寡悬殊。秋收以后，那些粮食没有增产或增产很少的农业社，又不得不把早先宣布提高的用粮标准再降下来；并且要用很大力量，在预分粮食过多过少的社员之间组织粮食调剂。结果不仅引起了社员的不满，增加了农业社的工作困难，而且影响了国家粮食收支的平衡，造成了多方面的被动。这是一条极其重要的教训。在下一粮食年度中，为了避免重复这一缺点，现在必须结合春耕生产，向广大农民进行粮食“三定”政策的再宣传。
    根据农业合作化以后的新情况，当前进行粮食“三定”政策的再宣传应当着重说明三条原则。
    第一条原则：今年仍旧按照“三定”时规定的用粮标准，核定农业社粮食购销数字。“三定”用粮标准虽然是在1955年小农经济还在农业经济中占优势的时候确定的，但大体上仍是与我国现时粮食生产和消费水平相适应的，还是可以保证农民在粮食消费上的基本需要的。农业合作化以后，广大农民加入了农业合作社，劳动量一般要比单干时大些，生猪和其他家畜也要发展一些，农业社为了多方面发展经济，也想多留些粮食去经营副业。农民这种发展经济的愿望是完全可以理解的。但是由于现时我国的粮食生产水平还比较低，在短期内还不能大规模垦荒，水、旱灾害也还不能迅速根治，生产增长的速度是缓慢的，所以还不可能迅速地充分满足各方面在粮食消费上日益增长的需要。因此，农民粮食消费状况的改善，不能够寄托在国家减少粮食购量或增加粮食销量，这对国家经济的发展和社会主义工业化的建设是不利的；而是应当依靠农业社自己努力增加粮食生产。这就是说，粮食“三定”时国家规定的用粮标准，是国家粮食分配政策的重要界限，但并不完全是农民的实际消费水平。只要是粮食增产的农业社，他们所增产的粮食，除了完成国家规定的增购任务外，多余的粮食都可以用来发展生产和改善生活；没有增产或者增产很少的农业社，就只好暂时节制粮食的消费。只有这样，才能从根本上防止粮食产消关系的失调，保证国家和全体农民的基本需要，同时促进粮食的增产。
    第二条原则：农业社（户）的实际粮食产量多于“三定”时核定的定产产量的，增产部分可以适当增购，或者相应减销。由于农业生产受自然条件的影响很大，粮食的收成丰歉，在地区之间和年度之间通常是不平衡的。例如像1955年那样的丰收年头，全国也还有些地方受灾减产。在灾区，国家必须减少粮食购量和增加粮食销量。同时由于城市人口的增加，国家对于商品粮食的需要也逐年增长。因此，为了调节地区之间和年度之间的粮食产需关系，保障社会主义建设事业和工农业生产在遭受严重灾荒的年头也能正常进行，必须在粮食“三定”的基础上，对一切粮食增产的农业社（户）适当增购或减销一部分粮食。只要增购的粮食数量不超过增产部分的40％，一切增产较多的社（户）就都有可能在较大程度上改善自己的粮食消费状况。实践证明，这一原则是完全能为农民接受的。
    第三条原则：余粮社分配粮食，应当“先国家后社员”。先国家，是指必须首先完成国家核定的粮食征购任务。后社员，是指在完成这一任务以后，才能改善社和社员的粮食消费状况。“先国家后社员”的基本精神，是保证国家和农业社及全体社员对粮食的基本需要。必须指出，在粮食“三定”基础不变的条件下，完成国家核定的粮食征购任务同保证农业社和全体社员在粮食消费上的基本需要之间，并无矛盾。“先国家后社员”所指的先后顺序，实质上是以保证农业社和全体社员在粮食消费上的基本需要为基础的。根据这一原则，农业社分配粮食的具体顺序是：首先，留足种子和耕畜饲料，并按照“三定”时规定的用粮标准分给全体社员基本口粮和生猪饲料。其次，完成国家核定的粮食征购任务。最后，再根据本社的余粮情况，去量力照顾其他需要。应当反复说明，农业社如果增产粮食很多，多分些粮食给一般社员，较多地分些粮食给那些劳动强、出工多的社员，或多用些粮食去经营副业，都是完全合理的。但是，在粮食的实际分配中必须严格遵守上述顺序。
    以上三条原则，集中地体现了粮食“三定”政策的精神。它们是农业合作化以后继续贯彻执行粮食“三定”政策的几个重要关键问题，也是广大农民最关心的问题。各地在春耕生产中必须深入宣传。
