Generals on the Farm
　　By Our Correspondent Gao Liang
　　The West Suburb Farm has been exceptionally lively these past few days. More than 160 high-ranking officers from the Beijing Garrison, led by General Yang Chengwu and General Zhu Liangcai, are there performing voluntary labor.

　　At dawn on the 7th, the generals, wearing old military uniforms and cloth shoes, brought their own dry rations, and arrived at the West Suburb Farm on time in transport trucks. At this time, dust and sand swirled, blurring the eyes, but they still acted as if in battle, dividing into six groups according to the farm's plan and heading to the work areas with the workers.

　　Look! What a magnificent scene! These heroes, who have fought on many battlefields, have returned to their youthful hometown trades. The first row setting up cucumber trellises included General Yang Chengwu and General Zhu Liangcai, with the farm's union chairman, Wang Zhiguang, working alongside them. During the intense labor, General Yang Chengwu got two bamboo splinters in his hand and couldn't pull them out himself for a moment. A comrade standing behind him called out, "Commander Yang, let me help you pull them out..." Chairman Wang Zhiguang didn't initially recognize General Yang Chengwu, but when he looked up sharply, he realized, "So this is Commander Yang!" Chairman Wang Zhiguang is from Lingxi Village in Yi County, Hebei Province, which was the old base area of the First Military Sub-district of the Jinchaji Military Region during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, he was a hired laborer in his hometown, and General Yang Chengwu's troops had won many victories in their village. In 1944, when the troops engaged in a production campaign, the largest pumpkin and eight-jin eggplant presented to the sub-district leaders were grown in Nanzhuang, Lingxi Village. At that time, he really wanted to see Commander Yang. Later, when studying the history of the Long March at the farm, he learned that Commander Yang Chengwu was also the one who personally commanded the daring crossing of the Luding Bridge and the breakthrough of the treacherous Lazikou Pass. He wanted to meet him even more. Now his wish has been fulfilled. He saw Yang Chengwu and was working with him.

　　Political Commissar Zhu Liangcai, who has been in poor health due to injuries sustained during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, is now assisting General Yang Chengwu, but his spirit is high, and he doesn't forget to do his political mobilization work wherever he goes. Listen, he's shouting, "Comrade Suo Libo, sing an opera excerpt!" Mongolian officer Major General Suo Libo is a Peking opera enthusiast, but at this time he is covered in sweat from exhaustion, so how can he care about singing a bass role?

　　On this side, digging the ground and tying tomato vines are Lieutenant General Zhang Nansheng, director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, who recently left the hospital but voluntarily came to participate. He is over fifty years old, but he brings out the skills he learned as a child working on the farm, and still looks like an old farmer. In front of him is Corps Commander Qiu Wei, who is also undergoing treatment but voluntarily came. A cadre from the farm asked Corps Commander Qiu, "Are you tired? Can you handle this work?" He nodded and said, "I can handle it. If I have the opportunity to work often, my body will be healthier." He said that this is his second time going to the field to produce. In Yan'an in 1943, the task for one person was to not only be self-sufficient but also to hand over five dou of millet and 20,000 yuan in border currency. At that time, in addition to farming, I also learned to spin thread, and I could spin four liang of cotton a day. A section chief nearby interjected, "It's not his second time working. In 1950, when the entire army was digging the Chaobai River, Corps Commander Qiu was the first to break ground. Look! This patient has already run ahead of us."

　　The task of improving the solar greenhouse by removing the tops was assigned to officers from the Armored Corps, Artillery Corps, and Ordnance and Logistics Departments. Major General Xu Shaohua of the Armored Corps joked, "The task of attacking fortifications is entrusted to us." The artillery officers echoed, "Attacking fortifications is our specialty." They worked very enthusiastically. Leading the way with a large crowbar to pry open the greenhouse roof was Zhang Xifan, Minister of Ordnance, an officer from an intellectual background. He usually likes to grow vegetables and flowers himself. He said that the Party teaches us to participate in labor, and only in this way can we completely change a person's ideology.

　　Falling behind was Major Wang Zhihui, a student at the Logistics Academy, who specifically came to participate in the labor during his holiday. An intern from the Agricultural University always wanted to help him, teaching him that he should use both elbows simultaneously when covering the cucumber seedlings with soil. He did as he was told, but his right hand always seemed slower and clumsier. When the intern took his hand to teach him again, he gently said, "Comrade, please forgive me! My right hand is disabled."

　　At noon, as the farm bell rang, the comrades rested. Walking in the fields filled with the fragrance of blooming rapeseed flowers, General Yang Chengwu took the lead in singing the "Production Chorus," and the song "In the second month of the year, the spring is beautiful, every household is busy farming" echoed throughout the West Suburb Farm.

    将军们在农场上
  　本报记者　高粮
    西郊农场，这两天特别热闹。以杨成武上将和朱良才上将为首的驻京部队一百六十多名高级军官，正在那里进行义务劳动。
    7日的早晨天刚亮，将军们就穿上旧的军装踏着土布鞋，自带干粮，坐着运输卡车按时到达了西郊农场。这时风沙滚滚，迷人眼脸，但他们仍然像作战一样按农场计划分成六个箭头同工人一起奔向作业区。
    看吧！这是一幅多么壮观的场面啊！这些久战沙场的英雄们又回到年青时代故乡的本行了。扎黄瓜架的第一行人是杨成武上将和朱良才上将，农场的工会主席王志光就在旁边同他们一起劳动。在紧张的劳动中，杨成武上将的手上扎了两根竹刺，自己一时拔不出来，站在后面的一位同志叫着“杨司令员，我来帮你拔……”工会主席本来不认识杨成武上将，这时猛抬头注视起来，原来这就是杨司令员呀！王志光主席是河北省易县岭西村人，那是抗战时期晋察冀军区第一军分区的老根据地，那时他在家乡当雇工，而杨成武将军的部队就在他们村打了许多次胜仗，1944年部队搞生产运动，向分区首长献礼的最大的南瓜和八斤重的茄子就是在岭西村的南庄上种植出来的。那时他就很想看看杨司令，后来在农场学习长征历史时，他又知道亲自指挥飞渡泸定桥和突破天险腊子口的也是杨成武司令员，他更想见他一面了，现在他的愿望达到了，他看到了杨成武，而且正和他在一起劳动。
    由于第二次国内革命战争负伤残废而一直身体多病的朱良才政委现在给杨成武上将打下手，但是他的精神焕发，他随地不忘作他的政治鼓动工作。你听，他喊起来了，“索李波同志，唱段戏吧！”蒙古族军官索李波少将是一个京剧爱好者，但这时他累得满身大汗，那还顾得上唱黑头呢？
    这边扒地和绑西红柿蔓的是刚出医院不久而自动赶来参加的志愿军政治部主任张南生中将，他是五十多岁的人了，但拿出幼年干庄稼的本事来依然像个老农，在他前面的是正在疗养中的丘蔚军长，他也是自动赶来的，农场的一位干部问丘军长“累不累？这个活干得来吗？”他点点头说：“干得来，如果总有机会干活我的身体会更好些”，他说这是我第二次下地生产了，1943年在延安搞生产时，一个人的任务是除自给自足外还要上交五斗小米和两万元的边币，那时我除了种地外还学会了纺线，一天能纺四两棉花。旁边的一位处长插口说：他不是第二次劳动，1950年全军挖潮白河时，丘军长是第一个破土开工的人，你看！他这病号已经跑到我们前头去了。
    改良阳畦拆顶的工作分给了装甲兵、炮兵部和军械、后勤部的军官们，装甲兵部的徐绍华少将打趣的说：“攻坚任务交给我们了”。炮兵军官们附和着说，“攻坚是咱们的拿手戏哩。”他们干的非常起劲，为首的一个用大杠子撬棚顶的是军械部长张西凡，这是一位知识分子出身的军官，他平时喜欢亲自种菜、养花，他说，党教育我们要参加劳动，只有这样，才能彻底改变一个人的思想意识。
    掉到最后的就是王志慧少校了，他现在是后勤学院的学员，利用假日专门赶来参加劳动的。农业大学的一位实习生总想帮助他，教给他盖黄瓜幼苗浮土时应该两肘同时用力，他照做了，但总显得右手迟慢和笨些，当实习生拿着他的手再次教时，他才轻轻的说，“同志请原谅！我的右手是残废。”
    中午随着农场的铃声同志们休息了，走在芬芳四射菜花遍开的田野上，杨成武上将带头唱起“生产大合唱”，“二月里来好春光，家家户户种田忙”的歌声响遍了西郊农场。（附图片）
