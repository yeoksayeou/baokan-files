    According to a TASS report from Montevideo on the 4th, the Central Committee Plenum of the Brazilian Communist Party issued a resolution on celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in Brazil.
    
    The resolution, published in "Workers' Voice," pointed out that the Great October Socialist Revolution was a decisive factor in the formation of the Brazilian Communist Party. Founded on Leninist principles and loyal to Marxism-Leninism, the Brazilian Communist Party has, for the thirty-five years since its establishment, always held high the banner of proletarian internationalism and firmly stood on the side of the mighty bulwark of world peace, the Soviet Union.
    
    Considering the enormous historical significance of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Central Committee decided to begin preparations to celebrate this great day. In Brazil, preparations and celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution will be carried out under the banner of unity in the world communist movement and under the slogan of fighting for peace, national independence, and the welfare of the people. The resolution emphasized that the Communist Party should widely disseminate the great achievements of socialist countries and propagate socialist ideas among the masses.

    巴西共产党决议广泛传播社会主义思想
    据塔斯社蒙得维的亚4日讯：巴西共产党中央委员会全体会议发表关于在巴西庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的决议。
    “工人呼声报”上所登载的决议指出，伟大的十月社会主义革命是形成巴西共产党的决定因素。建立在列宁主义原则基础上、忠于马克思列宁主义的巴西共产党，在成立以来的三十五年中始终高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜、坚定地站在世界和平的强大堡垒、苏联的一边。
    中央委员会考虑到伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年巨大的历史意义，决定开始筹备庆祝这个伟大的日子。在巴西，人们将在世界共产主义运动团结一致的旗帜下，为和平、民族独立、人民福利而斗争的口号下进行筹备和庆祝十月革命四十周年。决议着重指出，共产党应当广泛传播社会主义国家的伟大成就和在群众中间宣传社会主义思想。
