    Street Talk and Alleyway Discussions
    Department Heads of the Provincial Party Committee Buying Greens
    I don't know if it's the effect of the recent regulations on frugality in government offices, or because the central government's rectification instructions have reached here, but in the past few days, I've run into several department heads from the provincial party committee taking the public bus with us. The public canteen also has a few more distinguished guests, and the wives of the department heads have left the small kitchen specially set up for provincial party committee members and come to eat in the ordinary canteen. Our relationship seems to have become much closer all of a sudden, and some of the past barriers seem to have disappeared a lot.
    The day before yesterday, I ran into another department head coming back from the market, holding a large bunch of greens in his hand, and said with a smile, "The greens are very good, but they're in short supply." At that time, I was stunned, moved, and congratulated him endlessly.
    I firmly believe that as long as they often understand the people's conditions, they will always live among us. (Hu Xiayuan, Changsha, Hunan)
    Cadres Go to the Fields
    You ask about the situation of county and township cadres going to the fields? Let me tell you about last year first. Last year, production suffered some losses because the cadres insisted on planting cotton, sweet potatoes, and grain in the low-lying areas, and they were all flooded. Just when we were hoeing the second time, the commune took all the able-bodied young men to patrol the river embankment, and the land was left uncultivated, with weeds as tall as seedlings. At that time, there was a saying: "If you want to find grass, run to the commune; if the commune doesn't have enough, gather it from the team." To be fair, the leadership also intended to improve production, but they didn't get close to the masses and made a mess of good things without discussing it with everyone. In the past, the commune cadres didn't go to the fields to work, and the commune members had opinions about this in their hearts. They didn't say it, but they didn't work hard. This year, from the beginning, it's different. The commune cadres have all gone to the fields, and the township and county cadres have also gone to the fields. Not only have they gone to the fields, but they're really working! Everyone is happy to see it and is working very happily. Do you think production will still not be good this year?

    Dialogue Between Two Readers
    A: So-and-so has written a lot of articles recently. Have you read them?
    B: It's still the same old stuff. I never read them.
    A: Why?
    B: Because his articles are "made" up. He teaches young people to connect with the masses, to be hardworking and simple, this and that, but in our office, he is the most detached from the masses and the least hardworking and simple. (Tian Jia)

    省委的部长买青菜
    不知是新近机关节约的规定发生了效果，还是因为中央的整风指示下达到这里的缘故，这几天，我有好几次碰到省委的一些部长和我们一起坐公共汽车。公共食堂里也多了几位嘉宾，部长夫人们从专为省委委员办的小灶食堂里，走到普通的食堂来吃饭了。大家的关系，好像一下子就亲近了起来，过去的一些隔阂也好像消除了许多。
    前天，我又碰到一位部长从菜场回来，手里拿着一大把青菜，笑着对我说：“青菜很好，就是缺货。”我当时为之愕然，为之感动，为之祝贺不已。
    我深信，只要他们经常地了解了民情，他们就会永远生活在我们中间。（湖南长沙胡遐元）
    干部下地了
    你问县乡干部下地以后的情况么？我先告诉你去年的事。去年生产上受到一些损失，就是因为干部硬叫在洼地里种棉花、红薯、谷子，结果都淹了；正当铲二遍地，社里就把青壮年都抽去巡河坝，把地荒了，草苗一般高。当时有个顺口溜：“要想找草，社里去跑，社里不够，小组里凑。”要说，领导上也是存心想把生产搞好，可是不接近群众，办事不和大伙儿商量就把好事办糟了。过去社干部就不下地干活，社员心里对这有意见，口上不说，可是干活不起劲。今年一开头，就不一样，社干部都下地了，乡干部、县干部也下地了，下地不算，真是干活！大伙儿看着高兴，都干的挺欢，你说今年生产还会搞不好吗？

    两个读者的对话
    甲：某某近来写的文章真不少，拜读过吗？
    乙：还不是老一套，我从来就不看。
    甲：为什么？
    乙：因为他的文章是“做”出来的。他教训青年说，要联系群众呀，要艰苦朴素呀，这样呀，那样呀，可是他在我们机关里却是最脱离群众和最不艰苦朴素的。（天假）
