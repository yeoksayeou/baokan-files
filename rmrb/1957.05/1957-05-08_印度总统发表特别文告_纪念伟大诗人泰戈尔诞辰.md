Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th May. The President of India, Prasad, issued a special message to commemorate the 96th anniversary of the birth of the great Indian poet Tagore on May 7th.

The message stated, "The birth of Rabindranath Tagore reminds us of the great epoch-making events in the modern history of Indian literature, culture and politics. On the one hand, the poet Tagore was not unaffected by Western knowledge; on the other hand, he was one of the most advanced Indians of this century who expressed India's thoughts, aspirations and desires to the West. Tagore made India aware of itself and made others aware of India, therefore, he can be said to have bridged the gap between East and West with his literary genius. On the occasion of his birth, I extend my sincere congratulations to all people in India and abroad who may be celebrating this anniversary." (Attached picture)

    印度总统发表特别文告
    纪念伟大诗人泰戈尔诞辰
    新华社新德里7日电　印度总统普拉沙德为纪念5月7日印度伟大诗人泰戈尔九十六周年诞辰发表了一篇特别文告。
    文告说，“拉宾德拉·纳特·泰戈尔的诞辰使我们回想起现代印度文学、文化和政治史上伟大的划时代事件。一方面，诗人泰戈尔不是没有受到西方知识的影响；另一方面，他又是把印度的思想、志趣和热望表达给西方人的本世纪最先进的印度人之一。泰戈尔使印度认识到它自己并且使别人认识了印度，因此，他可以说是用他的文学天才把东西方之间的鸿沟填平了。在他的诞辰的时候，我向印度和国外可能在庆祝这个诞辰纪念的一切人谨致贺意”。（附图片）
