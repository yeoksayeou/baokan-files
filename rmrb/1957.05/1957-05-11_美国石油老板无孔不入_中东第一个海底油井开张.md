American Oil Barons Are Ubiquitous
The Middle East's First Offshore Oil Well Opens

(Reported in this paper) The first offshore oil well in the Middle East went into production last month. The oil well is located in the Persian Gulf, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, and was invested in and developed by the American-operated Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO).

Western oil companies believe that there are vast reserves of oil under the Persian Gulf seabed. In order to plunder Middle Eastern oil resources on a larger scale, they are fiercely competing for offshore oil drilling rights in Middle Eastern countries. In addition to American oil companies, British, French, and Italian oil companies are actively operating in the Persian Gulf. The British Shell Oil Company was originally drilling in eighty feet of water off the coast of Qatar, but the equipment was destroyed by a storm last year and is currently being re-installed. Off the coast of Trucial Oman, British and French capital are preparing to jointly develop an oil well. In addition, Italian oil companies are also actively seeking to obtain offshore oil drilling rights in the Persian Gulf.

    美国石油老板无孔不入
    中东第一个海底油井开张
    本报讯　中东地区第一个海底油井上月份开始投入生产。这个油井位于波斯湾内，靠沙特阿拉伯海岸，是由美国人经营的阿美石油公司投资开采的。
    西方各国石油公司认为波斯湾海底藏有巨量石油。它们为了更大规模地掠夺中东石油资源，正对中东国家海底石油采掘权进行激烈争夺。除美国石油公司外，英、法以及意大利的石油公司都在波斯湾内积极活动。英国的壳牌石油公司原在卡塔尔海外八十英尺深水下进行钻探，去年设备为风暴摧毁，目前正重新进行装置。在特鲁西尔海外，英法资本正准备共同开采一个油井。此外，意大利的石油公司也在活动取得波斯湾海底石油的开采权。
