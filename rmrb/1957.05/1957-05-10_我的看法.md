    My Opinion
    Huang Yaomian

    The intellectuals of the older generation come from the old world. They have all traveled a long journey in the old world. However, because everyone has experienced different journeys, their clothes are stained with different wine stains and different dust. For this reason, their views on today's new era inevitably come from their past experiences for measurement and comparison.

    Comrade Fei Xiaotong said that now is the early spring for intellectuals. I think this statement has some truth and also represents the views of some people. But in my personal opinion, it has been spring since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is not to contradict anyone intentionally. It can only be said that I have my own experiences. When the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, I was only half a vagrant and half an intellectual. Life was like being hung in the air by a thread. Unfamiliar faces often appeared at the door, and someone often peeked over the short wall outside the window. When walking, I often worried about being followed. As for writing, I could not become a literary giant. Wandering outside the walls of the university, I could only be a passerby outside the wall, yearning for the beauties inside. When the whole country was liberated, seeing that the people of the whole country were liberated, the reactionary Kuomintang rule was overthrown, and the imperialist forces that had been rampant in China for more than a hundred years were driven out of mainland China, I couldn't help but rejoice. And I personally had the opportunity to follow many experts and scholars as a small intellectual, with the opportunity to touch books. This was indeed much warmer than when I used to wander the streets on cold, windy nights. So I said, from that time on, it was spring.

    Of course, spring still inevitably has one or two cold spells, or an easterly wind blows away many fallen petals overnight, or even an individual may still have a period of "spring sadness," but spring is still spring. It is only regrettable that I cannot be like the plum blossom, the first to convey the message of spring.

    As for the problems that intellectuals are currently troubled by, I think they are also diverse. From the perspective of the vast majority of people, five-sixths of the research time is guaranteed. Some of these people are indeed immersed in research, while others are preparing lessons very nervously. Today's students are more independent in their thinking, and they raise many questions. Contention is of course good, but contention also requires capital. The spirit of delving into professional work has been improved. However, their social activities are very few. Some people, because they have not received any political treatment, especially some who had a certain position in academia in the past, or who were active for a time, feel a little lonely when they look back on the past. For both of these types of people, the problem is not how to guarantee five-sixths of the time, but how to better use five-sixths of the time to do a good job in research and teaching, and how to better use one-sixth of the time to carry out political study and do some social activities. That is to say, the problem is not that there is too much politics, but that there is too little politics.

    Indeed, some people have too many social activities, which encroach on their five-sixths of academic research time. This kind of person is actually not many, but they are the easiest to complain, and their complaints are the easiest to be heard. Among these people, some can indeed do more research work, and they themselves are willing to calm down and do some research work. But some people just complain, but in fact they are "happy to do so." If they are really asked to come out less, they will be alarmed. But we cannot say that their complaints are all false. No, it still has some sincerity. However, this is just occasional lyricism, or an occasional expression of nostalgia for the old profession that has been indulged in for many days in front of old friends. If we regard these complaints as their guiding ideology, it may be a little too naive. A young person who works with intellectuals once said to me, "You intellectuals are really not easy to deal with. If we put your name on the list and invite you to a meeting, you say, 'How can I have time to accompany you to the meeting?' If we don't put your name on the list, one day, when the list is published in the newspaper, you will see that your name is not on the list and you will complain, 'So-and-so has a name, who removed my name?' In short, it's like a twisted firewood, it's hard to figure out its grain." I think these words are also true. Although these two types of people have many social activities, can we say that they have too much politics? I don't think so. Because do they really have a deep understanding of political science? Do they have a good cultivation of political art? Do they have a very concerned feeling for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and a good connection with the masses? I don't think so yet. Some of them seem to be precious flowers, carefully protected by others. Over time, they also feel that they are really precious flowers, and they become a little bit arrogant. I think it is also necessary for them to study later.

    In general, the potential of intellectuals' current political enthusiasm has not been fully realized. In the future, with the increasing enrichment of democratic life, everyone will have more opportunities to speak, and the situation will get better day by day. The problem is that we need leadership and help. Guide people to look forward. In addition, if we can make appropriate adjustments to those who have too few social activities and those who have too many social activities, so that the violin has the opportunity to sound, the roaring drum can also have the opportunity to sound, and the elegant harp also has the opportunity to play a few notes, that would be even better.

    Intellectuals must have knowledge. It is difficult to find intellectuals without knowledge in the world, or intellectuals who are willing to be without knowledge. It is very natural for intellectuals to love knowledge and their own profession. It is also understandable for intellectuals to hope to have a study, with a few books in it. Therefore, assisting and promoting them to do a good job in their profession is a very important task. But if someone wants to hide in the study and not come out, I am afraid it is impossible in reality. Even if you want to "turn a deaf ear to the affairs of the world and devote yourself to the books of sages," the times will come to knock on your door, and it will give you many invitations. And today's intellectuals, who really want to go into the study and not care about the world, are probably very few. If someone really says that, it is probably out of a temporary feeling. Why? Because he always has to match what he has learned with the needs of the people. Applying what you learn, this is our old Chinese tradition. Could it be that today's intellectuals do not want to contribute their knowledge to the country and use it for the world? I don't think so. No one does not want his knowledge to play a role. If he can make a suggestion, and this suggestion is accepted and implemented by the government, he will feel a great spiritual comfort.

    In recent years, the main reason why intellectuals are not willing to talk about politics is that they have concerns. They worry that others will say that their position is unstable, or that they have idealism. But now the situation is different, and intellectuals have more opportunities to express their opinions. Are intellectuals willing to take out the valuable knowledge that they have gained through years of hard work and let everyone comment on it, or are they willing to bury it deep in their hearts and let time send it into the kingdom of oblivion?

    Chinese intellectuals inherit the tradition of scholar-officials, and their attitude is relatively reserved. They hope that others will have more respect for them, and take more euphemistic methods when criticizing them. These estimates are all correct. But I don't agree to compare today's intellectuals to Zhuge Liang. Of course, any metaphor is lame, but this comparison is too lame. Because after all, today's Chinese intellectuals no longer have the possibility of becoming Zhuge Liang, who lies high in Longzhong. He can neither collect rent, nor can he really roll up his sleeves and make a living by "cultivating the fields." And if he doesn't read many magazines and newspapers, and doesn't often listen to reports and contact people from all walks of life, even if he has a wealth of knowledge, how can he understand the general trend of the world? Therefore, others can have the heart to visit intellectuals three times, but intellectuals must not have the intention of letting others visit their thatched cottage three times. It is good for intellectuals to ask others to respect them, but intellectuals should also respect others, respect others' labor, and respect others' experiences and history of struggle. I think some intellectuals sometimes do not respect others enough. It's as if he was born to be Zhuge Liang, or he came down to earth in response to some star in the sky, and he was destined to shake his goose feather fan and command as he wished! We still have to learn more humility.

    Now let's talk about the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending." To really contend, we must first require the leadership to really dare to let go, and not let go and then take back, or want to let go but still take back. On the other hand, intellectuals must have confidence and courage in the implementation of this policy. Many problems that were thought to have been solved long ago, in fact, have not been solved after further research, and can still be brought up for debate. And if you don't bring it up for debate, the young students will have already brought it up for debate. So if you don't want to contend, it is impossible. In order to cultivate the courage to contend and improve the quality of contention, I think we can organize more small reading groups and small discussion groups. In small discussion groups, we can discuss certain important papers; someone can write an article and invite a few friends to give their opinions on his article; on some important academic issues, a few people can exchange opinions or start a debate. From small-scale seminars to large-scale seminars, to debates on the forum and debates in newspapers and periodicals.

    After the policy of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" was put forward, what a small intellectual like me worried about was what I could come up with to contend. But after thinking about it, contention is also a learning process. If I bring out immature opinions or even wrong opinions, and thus elicit endless insights, that would be a great pleasure for me. Because does truth have to be obtained through my hands? Does truth have to be placed in my pocket to be considered happiness? No matter who unearths the truth, the truth is the common property of mankind. Since it is common property, of course I can also share a bit of glory. Because I have figured this out, my courage has grown.

    我的看法
    黄药眠
    旧一代的知识分子是从旧世界来的。他们在旧世界里都曾经走过一长段的旅程。但是由于各人所经历的旅程不同，所以他们的衣襟上都染上有不同的酒痕和不同的尘土。也因为这个缘故，所以他们对于今天新时代的看法也就不免各人从其所已经经历过的旅程去加以衡量和比较。
    费孝通同志说现在正是知识分子的早春天气。这个说法，我认为也是有一部分理由，而且也代表了一部分人的见解。但在我个人看来，从中华人民共和国成立之日起就已经是春天，这并不是我有意要来唱反调。这只能说我有我的一番经历。当国民党反动派统治的时候，我只是半个流浪汉半个知识分子，生活像是被一条丝线悬在空中，门口时常有不尴不尬的生面孔出现，窗口的短墙外，时常有人露出一个头来在探视，走路的时候，也时常提防着后面有什么人跟踪。至于摇笔为文，既不能成为文豪，徘徊在大学的门墙外边，也只能作一个墙外的行人，向往于墙内的佳人的唉声。到了全国解放，眼看全国人民都获得解放，反动的国民党统治被推翻，在中国飞扬跋扈百多年的帝国主义势力从中国大陆被赶走，我就不禁大乐。而我个人则竟然有机会追随在许多专家学者后面做一名小小的知识分子，有机会摸摸书本，这比我过去有时在寒风割面的深夜里踯躅在街头的情况，的确是温暖得多了。所以我说，从那时起，就是春天。
    当然，春天也还不免有一、二次的春寒，或者是一夜东风不知吹散了落红多少，或者甚至个人也还不免有一个时期的“伤春”的情绪，但春天究竟还是春天。可惋惜的只是我不能像梅花最先传达出春天的消息。
    至于目前知识分子所苦恼的问题我认为也是多种多样的。从绝大多数的人看来，六分之五的研究时间是得到了保证了。这些人当中有些人的确是在埋头研究，有些人则在很紧张地备课。今天的学生，更能独立思考了，提出来的问题是很多的。争鸣当然很好，但争鸣也得有资本。钻研业务的精神是提高了。可是他们的社会活动都是很少的。有些人则又因为没有得到什么政治待遇，特别是一些过去曾经在学术上有一定地位的，或在过去曾经活跃过一时的人物，抚今追昔，又未免有点寂寞之感。以上两种人，问题都不是在于如何保证六分之五的时间，而是如何更好地利用六分之五的时间来搞好研究和教学的工作，和如何更好利用六分之一的时间来进行政治学习和做些社会活动。也就是说，问题不是政治太多，而是政治太少了。
    的确也有些人，社会活动太多，侵犯了他的六分之五的学术研究的时间。这种人，其实并不多，但也最容易嚷，而且他们的嚷也最容易被人听见。这些人当中，有一部分人的确可以多做一些研究工作，而他自己也是愿意沉下心来做些研究工作的。但也有些人不过口里嚷嚷，而其实正是“乐此不疲”，真的要他少出来活动，他可要皇皇然起来了。但也不能说，他们这种嚷就都是假的，不，它还是有几分真情。不过这只是偶尔抒情，或者老朋友面前，偶然表示一下对于过去摩娑过许多时日的旧业的怀恋。如果把这些嚷就看成是他们的主导思想，这也许未免太天真一些。有一位做知识分子工作的青年，曾和我说过，你们这些知识分子真的不容易搞，把你们的名字放上去请你来开会吧，你又说，我那有时间来陪你们开会？如果不把你的名字放上去吧，有朝一日，名单在报上发表出来，你一看见大名没有在报上登出，又会大发牢骚，说某某都有名，我的名字谁给除去的？总之像是绞纹柴，很难摸清它的纹路。这些话，我认为也是真的。以上两种人，尽管社会活动很多，但是不是可以说，他们的政治太多了呢？我看还不是。因为他们是不是真的对于政治科学有深刻的研究呢？对于政治艺术有很好的修养呢？对国计民生有十分关切的心情、对群众有很好的联系呢？我看还没有。他们有些人，好像是名贵的花，被人十分小心地保护着。久而久之，也就自己觉得真是名贵的花，而有些儿飘飘然起来了。我看以后也有必要让他们学习学习。
    总的说来，知识分子目前的政治积极性的潜力还远没有充分发挥。今后随着民主生活的日益充实，大家有更多机会说话，情况是会一天天好起来的。问题是需要领导和帮助。诱导人们向前看。此外，如果能再把社会活动过少的和社会活动过多的人加以适当的调整，使小提琴固然有机会鸣，就是轰然作响的大鼓也可以有机会响，典雅的竖琴也有机会来丁冬的几声，那就更好了。
    知识分子总得要有知识。天下总很难找到没有知识的知识分子，或者是知识分子自甘于没有知识。知识分子，喜爱知识，喜爱自己的专业，那是很自然的事情。知识分子希望有一个书斋，书斋里有几本书，那也是很可以理解的。所以协助和推动他们搞好业务，是很重要的工作。但是如果说，有人想躲进书斋里去就不出来了，那恐怕事实上也不可能。即使你想“两耳不闻天下事，一心专向圣贤书”，但是时代会来敲你的门，它会给你许多邀请。而且今天的知识分子，真的想钻进书斋里去，不出来过问天下大事的人，恐怕是很少的。如果真的有人这样说，那恐怕也是出自一时的感慨。为什么？因为他总得把他所学的东西，和人民的需要对对口径。学以致用，这是我们中国的老传统。莫非今天的知识分子，不想把他的知识贡献给国家，为世所用？我想不是的。没有不愿意他的知识发挥作用的。如果他能作出建议，而这个建议又为政府所接纳见诸实行，他一定会感到精神上莫大的安慰。
    近年来知识分子之所以不大肯谈政治，主要就是有顾虑。顾虑别人说他立场不稳，说他有唯心主义。可是现在情形不同了，知识分子多发表意见的机会来了。难道知识分子不愿意把花了多年的劳动获得来的宝贵的知识，拿出来让大家品题，而甘于把它埋在心灵深处让时光送入遗忘的王国？
    中国知识分子继承士大夫的传统，态度比较矜持，希望别人对他有更多的尊重，批评起来采取更委婉一些的办法，这些估计都是对的。但我不同意把今天的知识分子比成诸葛亮。当然任何比喻都是跛脚的，但这个打比，却跛得太厉害一些。因为究竟今天的中国知识分子已经没有成为高卧隆中的诸葛亮的可能了。他既不能收租，又不能真的卷起袖子来以“躬耕”为活，而且如果他不读许多杂志报章，如果不经常听报告，和社会各方面的人士接触，即使他有满腹经纶，又如何能了解天下大势？所以别人对于知识分子尽可以有三顾茅庐之心，而知识分子可切不要存让别人来三顾茅庐之意。知识分子要求别人尊重，这是好的，但知识分子，也应该尊重别人，尊重别人的劳动，尊重别人的奋斗经验和历史。我觉得有些知识分子有时候就不够尊重别人。好像他就是天生成的诸葛亮，或者是应着天上的什么星宿下凡，命定的摇摇鹅毛扇就可以指挥如意！我们还得更多学习谦虚。
    现在再就百家争鸣来谈罢。要真的争起来，就首先要求领导方面真的敢放，而且不要一放一收，或欲放还收。另外一方面，则知识分子要对于这个政策的贯彻有信心，有勇气。有许多问题过去认为早已经解决了的，实际再研究一下，还是没有解决，还可以提出来争论。而且你不提出来争论，青年同学们早就提出来争论了。所以你想不争鸣，也就不可能。为了培养争鸣的勇气，提高争鸣的质量，我认为可以多组织一些小型的读书会，小型的讨论会。小型讨论会中，就可以某些重要论文提出讨论；可以由某一个人写好文章，约几个朋友来对他的文章提提意见，可以就某些重要的学术问题，先由几个人交换意见或展开争辩。由小型的座谈会到大型的座谈会，到讲坛上的争鸣和报纸刊物上的争鸣。
    “百家争鸣”的方针提出来以后，像我这样的小知识分子，所担忧的就是，我能够拿出什么东西来争鸣。但过后一想，争鸣也就是学习的过程，如果我把幼稚的意见或甚至错误的意见拿出来，因而引出了层出不穷的真知灼见，那对我也是莫大的快乐。因为真理难道一定要通过我的手里获得么？真理难道一定要放在自己的荷包里才算是快乐么？无论谁把真理挖掘出来，真理都是人类共有的财产。既然是共有的财产，当然我也就能分享得一分光荣了。因为想通了这一点，所以我的胆子也就大起来了。
