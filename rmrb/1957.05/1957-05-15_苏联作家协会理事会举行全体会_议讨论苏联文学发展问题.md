    Soviet Writers' Union Board Holds Plenary Session to Discuss the Development of Soviet Literature

    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, May 14th: The plenary session of the Soviet Writers' Union Board began today in Moscow. This session will discuss the development of Soviet literature since the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The plenary session was originally scheduled for March but was later postponed. At that time, a reporter interviewed the First Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union, Surkov, about the state of Soviet literature and the content of the plenary session. Surkov said: The 20th Congress of the CPSU raised new questions for literature. In the past year, there have been sharp and heated debates at writers' meetings on the main issues of the development of Soviet literature, primarily regarding the essence and progressive role of socialist realism, and how literature should participate in the people's efforts to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Naturally, these issues also include the elimination of the cult of personality, as some literary authors had made the mistake of exaggerating the individual role of historical figures. The meetings of writers also sharply discussed the issues of the style of embellishment and the theory of no conflict in literature. Recently, many works have emerged that sharply criticize the dark sides and shortcomings of social development. In the debates evaluating these works, it was believed that Ovechkin's feature "Difficult Spring," Tendryakov's "Novels and Stories," etc., are in line with the principles of socialist realism, because the force of criticizing shortcomings in these works is tantamount to affirming the force of the Soviet social system. There were different criticisms in evaluating Dudintsev's novel "Not by Bread Alone," Granin's short story "Personal Opinion," Yashen's short story "Lever," etc. Many people believe that in these works, the shortcomings that do exist in society become the basic appeal of the works, so these authors intentionally or unintentionally distort the picture of Soviet reality. The above-mentioned issues that have caused controversy will be brought up for discussion at the May plenary session.

    苏联作家协会理事会举行全体会
    议讨论苏联文学发展问题
    本报莫斯科14日电　苏联作家协会理事会全会今天在莫斯科开始举行，这次全会将讨论从苏共第二十次代表大会以来的苏联文学发展问题。这次全会原定3月间举行，后来延期。当时记者曾经访问苏联作家协会第一书记苏尔科夫关于苏联文学的情况和全会的内容。苏尔科夫说：苏共第二十次代表大会向文学提出了新的问题。过去一年中，在作家的会议上，对于苏联文学发展的主要问题，举行了尖锐和热烈的辩论。首先是关于社会主义的现实主义底本质和进步作用，关于文学应如何参加人民实现第六个五年计划的建设工作中去。在这些问题中，自然也有消除个人崇拜问题，因为一部分文学作者曾经犯了夸大历史人物的个人作用的错误。在作家的会议上还尖锐地讨论了文学中粉饰作风和无冲突论调问题。最近一年来出现了许多作品，它们尖锐地批评社会发展的阴暗面和缺点。在评价这些作品的辩论中，人们认为：奥维奇金的特写“困难的春天”，邓德里雅科夫的“小说和故事”等等是符合社会主义的现实主义原则的，因为在这些作品中批评缺点的力量无异于肯定苏联社会制度的力量。在评价杜津采夫的小说“不只是为了面包”，葛兰宁的短篇小说“个人的意见”，雅申的短篇小说“杠杆”等等时候，有不同的批评。许多人认为：在这些作品中，社会中确实存在的缺点成为作品的基本的感召力，因此这些作者有意或者无意地歪曲了苏联现实的情景。以上引起争论的问题，将提到5月全会上讨论。
