    From "Exhausted Mountains and Rivers" to "A New Horizon"
    — An Interview with Mr. Li Jinghan —

    On a day graced by the spring breeze, I visited Mr. Li Jinghan, professor at Renmin University and a renowned expert in social survey research. He used the changes in his personal life over the past few years to illustrate his views on the issues of "blooming" and "contending." With Mr. Li's consent, the reporter has compiled his conversation and published it here.

      Our conversation began with his research. He said that, due to the training of his profession, he has long believed in facts, and in the truth contained in ancient sayings such as "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." He often uses this standard to test the authenticity of theories or propaganda. This was the case in the past, and this time his views on the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and correctly handling contradictions among the people are still the same. He said: "The Communist Party is now a ruling party. It is natural for them to see themselves as privileged. At the same time, they have always been the ones who rectify and transform others, as seen in the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries movements. But now, suddenly there is a movement asking the former transformers, the rulers, to accept the opinions of those who were rectified, to accept criticism. This is really abnormal. Looking at the past and present, both in China and abroad, which ruler would do this?" It was precisely the shining light of the Party's greatness that enabled him, after a long period of silence, to rekindle the unique and firm perseverance of a scientist and work diligently day and night. The reporter gave him an analogy, calling it "a withered tree blooming." He said that if it really is a withered tree blooming, then the process of "blooming" is a very painful memory.

    Two and a Half Years, Five Job Changes

    When Beijing was liberated, Mr. Li Jinghan was the head of the Sociology Department at Fu Jen Catholic University. Not long after the ideological remolding movement, with the adjustment of departments and colleges, the Sociology Department was abolished, and all the professors and scholars who engaged in sociology were collected in the Labor Training Department of the Central University of Finance and Economics. Later, the Central University of Finance and Economics was abolished, and some of them were transferred to Renmin University along with the Labor Training Department. During the Central University of Finance and Economics period, Mr. Li was initially assigned to be an assistant under a part-time teacher who taught mechanics. The course was mechanics, but Mr. Li's specialty was social survey. Since he was an assistant, students had to ask him for tutoring. There was no way around it, so he had to borrow mechanics books and use the method of looking at pictures to learn the characters. After a period of rote memorization, he was actually able to recite many terms, such as multi-cutter multi-blade, high-speed cutting, shaper... He could recite them all, and because he only memorized this one subject, his grades were even better than the students'. After a semester, he had just memorized this new set of things, but in the next semester, he was assigned to be an assistant to a textile teacher. He started again to understand how cotton becomes yarn, how coarse yarn becomes fine yarn, how it becomes cloth, how the shuttle moves, and so on. Because the assistant had the responsibility of tutoring, he also had to actively go to the students to tutor them. The students happily lay in their dormitories listening to tutoring, and the assistant had to visit them. The teacher was an engineer from a professional department, and he couldn't come to review the lessons at the end of the semester. So, the students all came to the assistant again, and the assistant didn't dare not find a way, so he had to rack his brains to find shortcuts for them. Mr. Li smiled wryly and said: "After some effort, I was actually able to compile something like a review outline!" A year later, he was transferred to Renmin University, and he was assigned to be an assistant to a teacher who taught "Labor Insurance," helping to prepare some lecture notes, with the hope of teaching the course. He thought that this was somewhat similar to what he had studied before, so he worked hard to learn the new theory. But just when he was able to compile some lecture notes, the leadership said that the labor insurance work had been transferred from the Ministry of Labor to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the school would not offer this course, so it was over again. He was then assigned to prepare teaching materials for the course "Labor Force Allocation," but when the semester started, the leadership again believed that this course would only take two or three weeks to teach, which was not worth offering as a special course, so it was no longer needed. Later, he was assigned to work on "Labor Protection," but this course was not easy to handle, as different types of work had different labor protection requirements, with many categories and a wide range of knowledge required. Finally, he heard that he had done worker surveys before, so they wanted him to investigate the protection of female workers. He worked on it for eight months with great interest. However, after submitting the investigation report to the leadership, there was no further response.

    Just to "Put on These Glasses"

    The reason why the school leaders tossed him around arbitrarily was because they had a fixed view. Mr. Li became very agitated when he spoke of this. He said that when he was first assigned to the Central University of Finance and Economics, a Party cadre lectured him, saying that if you find that a specific new thing, policy, or problem is different from your own views, then there must be something wrong with your own thinking. He thought this made sense at first, but gradually he realized that this was actually telling him to his face that they thought he didn't understand Marxism-Leninism. Without understanding Marxism-Leninism, he was not qualified to teach at all.

    Not only did Party cadres "educate" him in this way, but even students helped to "remold" him. During the ideological remolding at Fu Jen Catholic University, a student asked him if he was still confident in teaching the course well. When he was "passing the test," a student directly lectured him, saying: "When you go to the countryside to collect materials, you should accept the facts without any prejudice, like a blank sheet of paper, objectively, and without any preconceived notions." He said, "In other words, don't wear colored glasses." This was originally a calm and peaceful sentence, but he didn't expect the student to immediately loudly lecture him, saying: "Don't wear colored glasses! If you have another chance to do a survey, please remember to wear the glasses of Marxism-Leninism, Mr. Li!" He secretly resolved to himself, "Yes, I must put on these glasses." These painful stimuli made him humble on the one hand and nervous on the other, fearing that he really couldn't teach. Such stimuli urged him to eagerly study theoretical courses and also learn Russian.

    He recalled that at that time, he was very enthusiastic about learning. He never missed a class, no matter if it was windy or snowy. In order to get a good seat in the front row, he would always go five minutes early for each class. He never missed taking notes. If he didn't clearly record a few words, he would definitely ask others after class and make them up. Once, he fell while riding his bike at night, and half of his body was completely injured. But when he looked at his watch, he remembered that today was a class discussion, and the location had been temporarily changed to Haiyuncang. There was only a quarter of an hour left. He gritted his teeth and endured the pain to pedal his bike. When he arrived, it hadn't started yet, and he was very happy.

    Mr. Li's grades in the theoretical courses were very good, but he was not satisfied. He said, "Memorizing by rote before the exam didn't use independent thinking to digest it. I don't think this is a learning method that encourages independent thinking, right?" He laughed. He said, "But anyway, I have put on these glasses!"

    "You've Been in Our School for So Many Years, and We Haven't Discovered You!"

    Mr. Li said that in the face of the indifferent reality in the past few years, he couldn't help but feel depressed. He didn't write articles, nor did he express many opinions. When the time came to oppose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, his health suddenly deteriorated, and he had the idea of retiring. He didn't want to be a burden to the people, nor did he want the leadership to be embarrassed by his job assignment. He felt that he had been a scholar all his life, but today he was eating idle rice while watching people's faces. It was truly a situation of "exhausted mountains and rivers with no way out." He thought to himself that he was sixty years old and should retire, letting the young people do it. But who would have thought that there would be a policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom later?

    After the Hundred Flowers Campaign, the director of the Statistics Teaching and Research Office began to ask to transfer him to the Statistics Teaching and Research Office, because the director had known him before. After he went there, the director thought of him in every way and cared for him in every way. He felt that he was also beginning to receive the Party's care, and he felt very warm in his heart. This warmth gradually changed his outlook on life.

    At this time, the People's Daily asked him to write an article, asking him to once again investigate the changes in the rural areas around Beijing. After obtaining the school's consent, he went to the countryside. This time, he investigated for more than three months. With the help of the school, his work went smoothly. After the article was published in the People's Daily, it aroused great interest and attention in society. People's China magazine asked him to write an article, and the English version of the Chinese Women magazine also asked him to write "The Past and Present of Chinese Women." Some places, such as radio stations and Soviet experts, also invited him to give lectures on "The Past and Present." Around the May Day Labor Day this year, several foreign guests, such as Cuban parliamentarians, also came to visit him. The leaders of Renmin University saw this situation and felt that there was some meaning to it. A leader said to him in surprise, "Mr. Li, the People's Daily discovered you, but you've been in our school for so many years, and we haven't discovered you!"

    Recently, the school leaders have been gradually caring about him. Vice President Zou Lufeng has personally visited his home several times, asking about everything. Once, he even accompanied him to farmers' homes for investigations and visits, talking until after 10:00 PM. Recently, a social survey research office was established in the research department, and it was decided that he would be responsible for presiding over it. Mr. Li's eyes were filled with a happy and satisfied light as he spoke of this. He said: "The research office is under my responsibility, and there are more than a dozen cadres. This is something I never dared to imagine! You think, for the past few years, I have always been ignored, but now I am suddenly given more responsibility. I never dared to think of this day. This turn should really be the second line of the couplet, 'A new horizon opens up.' Ah, there is still a beautiful view in front of me!"

    After his article comparing the past and present was published in the People's Daily, it also aroused the interest of the State Statistical Bureau in his many large-scale surveys in the past. A few weeks ago, Comrade Xue Muqiao discussed with him and invited him to participate in a preparatory meeting. The State Statistical Bureau, the Academy of Sciences, and Renmin University would jointly form a social survey team to conduct key surveys in Wuxi and Baoding first. After gaining experience, the survey would be promoted elsewhere. This team also plans to have him lead the cadres of the Social Survey Research Office of Renmin University to participate. He said: "You think, how can I not contribute my strength wholeheartedly?"

    Where are the "Walls" and "Trenches"?

    The reporter asked him, "What is the problem, after all?" He thought for a moment, and then asked the reporter in return: "What do you say?" But he still answered the question himself.

    He believes that in the past, when some Party comrades treated non-Party members or senior intellectuals, they first made an assumption about them, at least assuming that they were unreliable or possibly unreliable, and then guarded against them everywhere with the mentality of treating a thief. But this kind of precaution cannot but be felt by the other party. In this case, can you ask the other party to be sincere to you? It is conceivable that when their personality is damaged, can they easily give play to any initiative? "As for the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and ideological remolding movements at the time, some things were even more difficult to understand. At that time, I was simply not allowed to speak. Every time I was rectified, it was only 'correct if there is a mistake,' and 'be encouraged if there is no mistake.'" Speaking of this, Mr. Li recalled that when the leadership asked him to make his first self-criticism, he suffered a great blow because of his defense. From then on, he realized that as long as he accepted it, he could pass the test. When he encountered such an occasion for the second time, he accepted the experience of the last time and took it all upon himself and admitted it at the meeting. He said that this prescription was indeed effective. Not only was he not continue to be rectified, but he was elected as a member of the Savings Committee to rectify others. At this time, he suddenly realized, "Oh, so that's what it's all about!"

    In fact, according to Mr. Li's speculation, after the earth-shattering changes, after many movements, and after ideological remolding, the Chinese scholars' positions and viewpoints have changed, and they are all patriots and Marxists with new positions and viewpoints. They are all willing to contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. If Party comrades, especially leading comrades, can assume that everyone is one family, where would there be any "walls" and "trenches"? But some people in the Party cannot see the problem in this way, but only feel that they are the rulers, putting on the airs of rulers. Of course, things will not be good.

    Mr. Li believes that it is right for the ruling party to enjoy privileges and status. This has been the case throughout history, both in China and abroad. But the ruling party should also take the correct attitude towards the little brothers. He believes that if there is a new unity on the basis of a new understanding, then it will be even better.

    To Let Go, Let Go Completely Like Natural Feet

    Regarding the experience of intellectuals, Mr. Li made a very interesting analogy. He said that before the blooming and contending, all the pressure on them was like bound feet and sealed mouths. If they opened their mouths, they had to echo what others said. The current "letting go" is like unbinding feet. Of course, walking will not be very natural at first, so it is inevitable that there will be some deviations in the blooming and contending. Some people think that they can't see the achievements of the blooming and contending yet, which is too impatient. But some Party comrades, like Chen Qitong, are very afraid of letting go. They think that once they let go, the Party's prestige will be gone. But in Mr. Li's view, it is just the opposite. He believes that if you unbind feet, you should unbind them completely like natural feet. Only in this way can you advance China's science to the world level, and it will greatly enhance the Party's prestige.

    He believes that the key to solving contradictions among the people is to hope that all Party comrades can do what Chairman Mao said. Only then can everyone freely speak out and promote the new, so that the academic community can flourish. Because these old scholars have old knowledge, and at least they have understood the outline of Marxism-Leninism, then the combination of new and old knowledge, the combination of new and old people, will definitely achieve something. He said with great confidence that he is excitedly planning the new historical materialist social survey he wants to do, so that scholars in capitalist countries can see which one is more superior. Mr. Li particularly emphasized that it will be a brand-new social survey that combines Marxism-Leninism with practice.

    从“山穷水尽”到“柳暗花明”
    ——访问李景汉先生——
    在一个春风拂面的日子里，我访问了人民大学教授、著名的社会调查学专家李景汉先生，他以这几年来个人生活的变化来说明他对“鸣”和“放”问题的看法。征得李先生的同意，记者把他的谈话整理出来发表在这里。
      我们的谈话还是从他的调查研究开始的。他说，由于本行的锻炼，长期以来，他只相信事实，相信“千闻不如一见”等古语中所存在的真理。他常常用这个标准来检验理论或宣传的真实性。从前是这样，这一次对于我们党的百家争鸣、正确处理人民内部矛盾问题等方针问题的看法，也还是这样。他说：“共产党今天是个执政党，他们把自己看成为特权者，这是当然的事。同时，他们一向又是整人的、改造别人的人，这无论从三反、五反和肃反运动看，都是这样。但是现在，忽然要来一个运动，要从前的改造者、执政者来接受被整人的意见，接受批评，这实在是反常的事，从中外古今看，哪一个执政者会这样做呢？”正是由于事实上的党的伟大的光辉的照耀，使他能在长期的沉默之后，重新唤起科学家特有的坚定的毅力来夜以继日的辛勤地劳动着。记者给他打了一个比喻，叫做“枯树开花”，他说，如果这真是枯树开花的话，那末，这“开花”的过程就是一段很痛苦的回忆了。
    二年半的时间，工作换了五次
    北京解放时，李景汉先生在辅仁大学社会学系当主任。思想改造运动过后不久，随着院系调整，社会学系被取消了，原来搞社会学的这些教授学者们，一古脑儿收集在中央财经学院的劳动专修科。后来中央财经学院取消，他们一部分人就随着劳动专修科拨给人民大学。在中央财经学院时期，最初，李景汉先生被分配在一位教机械学的兼职教员手下勉强当一名助手。课程是机械学，李先生专长的却是社会调查，既然是助手，学生就得找你辅导，没法子，只好借来机械学的书，用看图识字的方法去学习。经过一段时间的强记，居然也能背诵出许多名堂，什么多刀多刃啦，高速切削啦，牛头刨床啦……都能背得出来，而且，因为只背这一门，所以比学生的成绩还好。经过一学期，这一套新玩艺儿刚背熟，但到了下学期，他又被分配为纺织教员的助手，他又从头了解棉花如何变成线，粗线又如何变成细线，变成布，梭是如何飞动，等等。因为助手有辅导责任，所以他还得主动找学生去辅导，学生高兴躺在寝室里听辅导，助手也得去登门拜访。教员是专业部门的工程师，到学期终了复习功课时，他是来不了的，这样，学生又一齐来找助手，而助手又不敢不想办法，只好费尽心血替他们找窍门。李先生苦笑了一下说：“经过一番努力，我居然也能编出一套复习大纲之类的东西哩！”过了一年，调到人民大学来了，又把他分配给一位教“劳动保险”的教员当助手，帮助搞点讲义，可能有教课的希望。他想，这倒和他从前研究的东西有些相近了，努力学习新理论吧。但是待他刚能编出一点讲义的时候，领导上说，劳动保险工作从劳动部移转到全国总工会去了，学校里不开这门课，又完了。又把他分配从事准备“劳动力调配”这门课的教材工作，但等到开学时，领导上又认为这门课程只讲二、三个星期就够了，不值得开专课，又不要了。后来，又分配他搞“劳动保护”，可是这门课程又谈何容易，不同的工种就有不同的劳动保护，门类多，要求的学问要广。最后又听说他从前搞过工人调查，于是又要他去调查女工的保护。搞了八个月，很有兴趣。但是，把调查报告送给领导之后，连下文都没有了。
    就为了“配上这副眼镜”
    学校领导上所以把他随便地抛来掷去，原来是有一个固定看法的。李先生谈到这里，很激动，他说，当他刚分配去中央财经学院时，一个党员干部教训他说，如果你发觉某一个具体的新事物、政策或问题同自己的看法有不同的时候，那一定是你自己思想上有毛病。他乍一听这话，颇有道理，但渐渐明白了，其实，这是当面告诉他，认为他们不懂马列主义，不懂马列主义，根本就没有资格教书。
    不但党员干部这样来“教育”他，就连学生也来帮助“改造”他。在辅仁大学思想改造的时候，有一个学生问他，还有把握教好课吗？当他正在“过关”中，一个学生直截了当地教训他说：“你下乡搜集材料时，应当无成见地、如白纸一样地、客观地、不存任何成见地去接受事实。”他说，“换句话说，不要带有色眼镜就是了。”这本来是平心静气的一句话，但是没想到那个学生立刻大声教训他说：“不带有色眼镜！再有机会做调查的话，请李先生记着一定要戴上马列主义的眼镜！”他暗自向自己下决心说：“对，我必须配上这副眼镜。”这些沉痛的刺激，使他一方面虚心，另方面心虚，怕自己真的教不了书。这样的刺激使他急切地鞭策自己学了理论课程，还学了俄文。
    他回忆说，那时学习劲头真大，刮风下雪，从不缺课；为了坐前排好座位，每次上课都早去五分钟；笔记从来不缺，如果有几个字没有记清楚，下课后一定向别人问清楚，补上。有一次，晚间骑车出门，摔了一跤，半边身子完全摔伤了，但是一看表，才想起今天是课堂讨论，地点又临时改在海运仓。时间只差刻把钟了，狠心忍着痛蹬车，赶到之后，还没有开始，很高兴。
    李景汉先生的理论课，考试成绩都很好，但是，他并不满意。他说：“考试前死背强记，并没有用独立思考去消化它，我想，这也不是鼓励独立思考的学习方法吧？”说着，他哈哈大笑了。他说：“但是，不管怎样，我已经配这副眼镜了！”
    “你在咱们学校呆了好几年，都没有发现你！”
    李先生说，前几年他在冷淡的现实面前，心情不免沉寂，不写文章，也不多发表意见。到反对胡风反革命集团那个时期，身体突然衰弱下来，有过退休的念头。他不愿做人民的累赘，不愿领导上为他的工作分配为难。他觉得自己做了一辈子学问，今天看人脸色吃闲饭，真所谓到了“山穷水尽疑无路”的地步了。自己想想，六十岁的人了，也该退休了，让那些青年人去干吧。但是，谁又想到后来还有个百家争鸣的方针出来呢？
    百家争鸣之后，统计教研室主任开始要求把他调到统计教研室，因为这位主任从前还知道他。去后，这位主任处处替他着想，处处关心他，他觉得他也开始受到党的关心了，心里感到非常温暖。这种温暖，渐渐地把他的人生观也改变了。
    正在这时，人民日报向他约稿，要他再一次调查京郊乡村的变化。得到学校的同意后，他就下乡了。这一次一共调查了三个多月，由于学校的帮助，他的工作进行得很顺利。那篇文章在人民日报发表后，在社会上引起了很大的兴趣和注意。人民中国杂志向他约稿，英文版的中国妇女杂志也要求他写“中国妇女的今昔”，有些地方如广播电台、苏联专家也请他去作“今昔”讲演，今年五一劳动节前后，有几位外宾如古巴议员等也来访问他。人民大学的领导同志看到这种情况，觉得还有点意思。有位领导同志就很惊讶地对他说，“李先生，人民日报发现了你，可是你在咱们学校里呆了好几年，我们都没发现你！”
    最近一个时期，学校的领导上倒是在逐渐地关心他了。邹鲁风副校长亲自登门造访有好几次，问长问短。有一次还陪他到农民家庭去调查访问，一直谈到晚上十点多钟。最近在研究部成立社会调查研究室，决定由他来负责主持。李先生说到这里，眼睛里充满了一种愉快而满意的光芒。他说：“研究室，由我负责，还有十几个干部，这是我从来不敢想像的事啊！你想，过去好几年，我一直是被人漠视，现在突然让我比较负责了，我哪里敢想过这一天。这一转，真该是下联‘柳暗花明又一村’了。啊呀，原来我的面前还有一片美景呢！”
    他在人民日报发表今昔对比的文章之后，也引起了国家统计局对他过去许多大规模调查的兴趣。前几个星期，薛暮桥同志和他商量，请他去参加一个筹备会议，由国家统计局、科学院和人民大学合组一个社会调查团，先在无锡和保定二地作重点调查，取得经验后，再往别处去推行调查。这个团体，也准备让他带领人民大学社会调查研究室的干部去参加。他说：“你想，我哪能不全心全意地贡献自己的力量呢。”
    “墙”和“沟”在哪里
    记者问他，究竟问题在哪里呢？他稍稍一想，然后又反问记者：“你说呢？”但是，还是他自己回答了这个问题。
    他认为，从前，有些党员同志对待党外人士或高级知识分子时，先对他们来一个假定，至少假定他们是不可靠或者可能是不可靠的，然后，以对待贼的心理来处处提防。但是，这种提防不能不让对方感觉到，在这种情况下，你要求对方还对你真诚，可能吗？可以想像得到，当他们的人格受到损伤时，他还能容易发挥出什么积极性呢？“至于三反、五反、思想改造运动的当时，有些事情更是难于理解的，当时简直就不让我说话，每次挨整都只有‘有则改之’，‘无则加勉’”。谈到这里，李先生回忆到领导要他第一次检讨时，他因为辩白，曾招来很大的打击。从此，他就意识到，只要接受，就能过关。赶到第二次遇到这样的场合时，他就接受了上次的经验，在会上首先一一包下来承认了。他说，这个单方，果然生效，他不但没有继续被整，反而被选为节约委员会委员来整人了。到这时候，他才恍然大悟，“哦，原来是这末一回事啊！”
    其实，照李先生推想，中国的学者经过翻天复地的变革，经过不少的运动，经过思想改造，他们的立场、观点都已经改变了，都已是有新的立场、观点的马克思主义者爱国者了。他们没有不愿把自己的力量贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业。如果党员同志，特别是领导同志，能够把大家假定成一家人，哪里还会有什么“墙”和“沟”呢？但是党内还有些人并不能这样来看问题，只是觉得自己是执政者，摆起执政者的架子，事情当然就不好了。
    李先生认为，执政党享有特权和地位，也是应该的，中外古今都是这样，原不稀奇。但是，执政党对待小兄弟也应该拿出对小兄弟的正确态度来。他相信，如果在新的认识基础上，有了新的团结，那就更好了。
    要放就要放成天足
    对于知识分子的遭遇，李先生打了一个很有趣的比喻，他说，在争鸣前，一切压力对他们来说，好比是缠了足、封了口，如果开口，就要人云亦云。现在的“放”是放足，刚一放足，走路当然是不很自然的，所以，在争鸣中有一点偏差是不可避免的。有人认为现在还看不见争鸣的成绩，那是太性急了。但也有一些党员同志像陈其通等很害怕放，他们认为一放，好像党的威信就没有了。但在李先生看来恰恰相反。他认为，如果放足，就彻底把它放成天足，这样才可以把我国的科学推进到世界水平，也正大大提高了党的威信。
    他认为，解决人民内部矛盾的重大关键，是要希望所有的党内同志都能像毛主席说的做的一样，那才能使得大家大鸣特鸣，推陈出新，使学术界开花。因为这些老学者们有旧的学问，且至少也领会了马列主义的轮廓吧，那末新旧学问合起来，新旧的人合起来，一定能做出一番成绩来。他非常自信地说，他正在兴奋地计划他要做的新的历史唯物主义的社会调查，将来让资本主义国家的学者们看一看，到底哪一种是更优越的。李先生特别强调说，那将是马列主义结合实际的、崭新的社会调查。
