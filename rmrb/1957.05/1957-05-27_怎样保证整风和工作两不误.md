The Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement require that the rectification in each unit be carried out under the principle of not delaying work. The purpose of the rectification movement is to improve work. By overcoming the unhealthy tendencies of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism within the Party, and by enabling the entire Party to understand how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and strengthening the unity between the Party and the broad masses outside the Party, the work of the Party and the country in all aspects will inevitably take on a new look. The Central Committee's instructions require integrating the rectification movement with the improvement of work and with the handling of contradictions among the people. Therefore, in the process of the rectification movement, work in all aspects needs to be continuously improved. However, the rectification movement is essentially a Marxist ideological education movement, and is different from general work inspections and improvements. Therefore, in the rectification movement, it is necessary to prevent both the tendency of "closed-door rectification" that is divorced from reality and does not combine with improving work, and the practice of equating the rectification movement with the daily work of solving various specific problems.

Closed-door rectification not only hinders work and increases contradictions between leaders and the masses, but also affects the rectification movement itself. It is very harmful to only abstractly talk about opposing bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism without improving certain work that can be improved immediately. This will disappoint the broad masses of Party members and the people. But on the other hand, if the rectification movement is simply reduced to solving some problems in the current work, it will not be possible to achieve the Central Committee's goal of "raising the entire Party's Marxist ideological level and improving its work style." In the future implementation of the Party's policies, the shortcomings and errors of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism will still be unavoidable. Even in solving current problems, if the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people is not truly grasped, it is possible to make the contradictions more complex and acute.

No matter how closely the rectification movement and the improvement of work are combined, there are still contradictions between the two. Carrying out the rectification movement inevitably takes a considerable amount of time. At present, economic, cultural, and educational work in all areas are very busy and intense, and some departments are facing many contradictions that must be dealt with immediately. Therefore, if the time arrangement for rectification and work is not appropriate, it is easy to focus on one at the expense of the other, or even to mishandle both.

How to properly arrange rectification and work? Most leading organs have considered this issue when formulating rectification plans. First, according to the Central Committee's instructions, rectification in various regions generally starts with the Party organizations of senior organs and universities, with the remaining units being placed in a later stage. In order to concentrate efforts and achieve the goal of systematically and thoroughly solving problems (including ideological problems and specific work problems), it is entirely necessary and entirely correct to proceed in batches in this way. Second, in the units undergoing rectification, many rectification leading groups have proposed to arrange work, distinguishing between the important and the urgent. For the main tasks that must be done well, they are pre-arranged and efforts are concentrated to ensure they are done well; for the secondary tasks, those that can be postponed are postponed, and those that can be dispensed with are dispensed with; for those that must be done, the working methods should also be improved to reduce meetings and reports, in order to reduce everyone's burden. This arrangement is also very necessary. Not only should arrangements be made when starting to formulate the plan, but also throughout the entire movement, the leading group needs to constantly adjust and deploy work. Units with seasonal work should pay attention to concentrating rectification in the seasons with less work; in the leading cadres, some units have also made appropriate divisions of labor between those who focus on leading rectification and those who focus on leading business. These measures have a positive effect on ensuring both rectification and improving work.

In addition to the measures that many units have already taken, we believe that in order to better combine rectification and work, the following two issues need to be paid attention to.

First, the duration of the rectification movement should not be too short. The content of this rectification movement is very rich, and it is required to use a serious and earnest, gentle and persuasive method to truly distinguish right from wrong, convince people with reason, clarify thoughts, and unite comrades. Without sufficient time, it is difficult to achieve these requirements. And the rectification movement cannot take up too much working time. No matter how it is arranged, almost every system has many urgent and major tasks that require a great deal of effort, such as summarizing the first Five-Year Plan, the increase production and practice economy movement, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest, and so on. Relaxing these tasks would be a big mistake, and would increase contradictions among the people. Therefore, to ensure that both rectification and work are not neglected, the process of the rectification movement must be appropriately lengthened. This will ensure that there is sufficient time for rectification, and that each week's rectification study does not take up too much working time. Some units do not seem to have noticed this issue yet. For example, in the system of central state organs, there are individual units that plan to complete the rectification movement in two or three months. We believe that this approach is worth considering. If, according to most units, two afternoons a week are used for rectification study, there will only be sixteen afternoons in total in two months. It is obviously unlikely that the rectification movement can be carried out well in such a short period of time. If too much working time is taken up, and three or four afternoons or even more are spent on rectification each week, although the rectification time may be longer, it is difficult to sustain it. No matter which unit's work, it is difficult to compress it to this extent. When the work is affected, and then adjustments are made, the rectification movement will inevitably be affected, and the result will still be a failure in both. The leading comrades of these units may be afraid that prolonging the rectification time will affect the work, but in reality, doing so will hinder both the work and the rectification. It is hoped that the leading comrades of these units can consider this issue.

Second, the rectification movement can and even inevitably will advance in a wave-like manner. Since the process of the rectification movement cannot be too short, during this period, many units will inevitably encounter some urgent and major tasks that require full effort. At this time, the rectification movement needs to be paused slightly or reduced in time. For example, if the flood situation is tense, the water conservancy department must make every effort to prevent floods. Moreover, since rectification requires serious resolution of complex ideological issues and specific work issues, it is impossible to imagine that the entire process will be a smooth and even linear progression. It is even more impossible to require that equal attention be given to all related issues throughout the movement from beginning to end. On the contrary, the actual movement will inevitably encounter this focus at one time and that focus at another time, thereby forming this or that paragraph. The Party organization responsible for leading the rectification should not force its subordinate units to maintain the same progress, nor should it force each unit to complete the rectification movement in one go without interruption. Therefore, for the rectification movement, it is necessary to prevent generalized and formulaic leadership, and to require specific and realistic leadership in accordance with the time, place, and event. Only in this way can the rectification movement develop vigorously.

### 怎样保证整风和工作两不误

    怎样保证整风和工作两不误
    党中央关于整风运动的指示要求各单位的整风在不耽误工作的原则下进行。整风运动的目的是为了改进工作。克服了党内的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义等不良倾向，全党懂得了如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，加强了党和党外广大群众的团结，党和国家的各方面的工作必然面貌一新。中央的指示要求把整风运动同改进工作结合起来，同处理人民内部矛盾结合起来。因此，在整风运动的过程中，各方面的工作需要不断地有所改进。但是，整风运动究竟是马克思主义的思想教育运动，而不同于一般的检查工作和改进工作。因此，在整风运动中，既需要防止脱离实际不同改进工作相结合的关门整风的偏向，也需要防止把整风运动和解决各种具体问题的日常工作混为一谈的作法。
    关门整风，不但要妨害工作，增加领导和群众之间的矛盾，而且整风运动本身也会受到影响。只是抽象地谈论反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，而不改进某些可以立即改进的工作，那是非常有害的。这将会使广大的党员和人民失望。但是在另一方面，如果把整风运动仅只简单化为解决当前工作中的一些问题，那也不可能达到中央所要求的“提高全党的马克思主义的思想水平，改进作风”的目的，在今后贯彻执行党的方针政策中，将仍然不能避免官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的缺点和错误。就是解决当前问题，如果不真正掌握正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，也有可能使矛盾更加复杂和尖锐起来。
    不管整风运动和改进工作结合得多么密切，二者之间还是有矛盾的。进行整风运动必然要花费相当多的时间。而目前，经济、文教各个方面的工作都十分繁忙和紧张，有些部门还面对着许多必须立即着手处理的矛盾。因此，如果整风和工作的时间安排得不够妥当，就很容易顾此失彼，甚至两头都误，一样也搞不好。
    怎样恰当地安排整风和工作呢？大多数领导机关在制定整风计划的时候已经考虑到这个问题。首先，根据中央的指示，各地区的整风一般地先从高级机关和大专学校的党组织开始，其余的单位都放在后一步。为了集中力量，达到有系统地透彻地解决问题（包括思想问题和具体工作问题）的目的，这样分批进行是完全必要和完全正确的。其次，在整风的单位中，很多整风领导小组提出要对工作进行安排，分别轻重缓急，对主要的必须做好的工作，就预先安排，集中力量保证一定做好；次要的工作中，可缓做的就缓做，可不做的就不做；必须要做的，工作方法也要力求改进，减少会议，减少表报，以减轻大家的负担。这种安排也是十分必要的。不仅开始定计划的时候要进行安排，而且在整个运动期间，领导小组都需要不断地对工作进行调整和部署。工作有季节性的单位，要注意把整风集中在工作较少的季节中；在领导干部中间，哪些人着重领导整风，哪些人着重领导业务，有些单位也都做了适当的分工。这些措施，对于保证整风和改进工作都有积极作用。
    除了许多单位所已经采取的措施以外，我们觉得，为了使整风与工作更好地结合，还需要注意以下两个问题。
    第一，整风运动的时间不宜太短。这次整风运动的内容十分丰富，又要求用严肃认真、和风细雨的方法，真正做到明辨是非，以理服人，弄清思想，团结同志。没有充分的时间就很难达到这些要求。而整风运动又不可能过多地占用工作时间。不管怎样安排，差不多每一个系统都有许多急迫的重大的任务需要投入很大的力量，比如总结第一个五年计划、增产节约运动、争取农业大丰收等等。放松这些工作，我们就要犯大错误，就会增加人民内部的矛盾。因此，要保证整风和工作两不误，只有把整风运动的过程适当放长一些，这样既保证有比较充裕的时间进行整风，每周整风学习又不致太多占用工作时间。有些单位目前似乎还没有注意到这个问题。比如，在中央国家机关系统中，就有个别单位计划用两个月或三个月的时间结束整风运动，我们觉得这种作法是值得考虑的。如果按照多数单位每周用两个下午的时间进行整风学习，两个月中总共才有十六个下午的时间，在这样短的时间内要把整风运动搞好，显然是不大可能的。如果过多的占用工作时间，每周拿出三四个下午甚至更多的时间进行整风，虽然整风的时间可以多一点，只是很难持久，不管那个单位的工作，都很难压缩到这个程度。等到工作受了影响，回头再来重新调整的时候，整风运动也就不可避免地要受到影响，其结果仍然是两误。这些单位的领导同志也可能是害怕整风时间拖久了会影响工作，实际上这样做却会既妨害工作又影响整风。希望这些单位的领导同志能考虑到这个问题。
    第二，整风运动可以甚至必然会波浪式地起伏前进。整风运动的过程既然不可能太短，在这一期间，很多单位都难免会遇到一些紧迫的重大的需要全力以赴的任务。这个时候，整风运动就需要稍稍停顿一下或者减少一些时间。比如，汛情紧张了，水利部门就必须全力进行防汛。而且整风既然需要认真地解决复杂的思想问题和具体工作问题，就不可能设想整个过程都是平铺直叙地等速度地直线前进。更不可能要求对于有关的一切问题在运动中自始至终都平均地给予相等的注意。相反，实际的运动将不可避免地一时遇到这个重点，一时遇到那个重点，从而形成这样那样的段落。负责领导整风的党组织，不要强求所属单位都保持同一的进度，也不要强求各个单位都毫无间歇地一鼓劲把整风运动搞完。因之，对于整风运动，要防止一般化和公式化的领导，要求因时、因地、因事制宜，进行具体的实事求是的领导。只有这样，整风运动才能生动活泼地向前发展。
