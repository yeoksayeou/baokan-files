    Different Standpoints
      Shen Tongheng
    Passengers who haven't squeezed onto the bus, even knowing it's packed, often complain at the door as if feeling wronged: "Move in! Move in! There's plenty of space inside!"
    Passengers who have already boarded the bus, settled comfortably in their seats, even knowing the bus isn't too crowded, often put on an air of fairness and politeness, saying: "Don't get on, it's completely full inside. Wait for the next bus!"
    Even the same passenger, when they haven't gotten on the bus, tends to act like the former type of person, but when they get on the bus, they tend to become like the latter. Due to different needs arising from different standpoints and circumstances, people will one-sidedly emphasize, or even deliberately contradict the facts, uttering different or completely opposite words, as if each has its own reason. But no matter how different they are, one thing remains completely the same: disregarding the facts, only caring about their own convenience, and not thinking about others.
    Facts are always facts; they are the objective and most impartial witnesses. As long as both sides are willing to respect them, and in addition to considering their own convenience, can also think a little for the other party, then perhaps all internal contradictions among the people will be much easier to resolve.

    立场不同
      沈同衡
    没有挤上公共汽车的乘客，明知车里挤得满满的了，也往往要在车门外抱不平似地嚷：“往里走！往里走啊！里面空得很哩！”
    已经上了公共汽车的乘客，自己坐稳在座位上了，明知车里并不太挤，也往往要装出公正有礼的样子，说：“别上啦，里面挤得满满的了，等后面的车吧！”
    即使是同一个乘客，没有挤上车的时候，他就往往要像前一种人那样，而当他上了车的时候，却也就往往会变成后一种人的样子。由于不同立场和不同处境的不同需要，人们会片面强调、甚至故意违背事实，说出各各不同或是完全相反的话来，而像煞各有道理。但是不管他们怎样不同，有一点却总是完全一样的，那就是不顾事实，只顾自己方便，不为别人设想。
    事实总是事实，它是客观的最公正的证人，只要双方肯尊重它，并在顾到自己方便之外，也能稍稍为对方设想设想，这样，一切人民内部的矛盾大概就容易解决得多了。
