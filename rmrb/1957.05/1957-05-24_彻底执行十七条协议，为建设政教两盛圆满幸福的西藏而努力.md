    Thoroughly Implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and Strive to Build a Theocratically Prosperous, Complete, and Happy Tibet
    Dalai Lama, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
    Today, May 23, 1957, marks the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet by representatives of the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government on May 23, 1951. Just as people from all walks of life in the Tibetan region are holding grand celebrations, I also want to commemorate and congratulate it on this day. Today, we not only need to commemorate and celebrate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the agreement, but also need to commemorate the achievements made in our work over the past six years. Over the past six years, thanks to the correct leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, the leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, the assistance of the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet, and the joint efforts of Tibetan cadres and people, Tibet has made much progress and positive development in its political, economic, and cultural aspects. For example, the unity, trust, and understanding between the Han and Tibetan nationalities have improved. Due to the opening of thousands of kilometers of air routes and highways, a large number of cadres and young people in the Tibetan region have been able to smoothly visit and study in the interior of the motherland, which has enhanced their patriotic ideology. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region last year not only firmly laid the foundation for Tibetans to enjoy the rights of being masters of their own affairs and national equality, but also carried out some industrial and other enterprise construction, and put them into production. In short, great achievements favorable to Tibet have been made in all aspects. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, with the help of Han cadres stationed in Tibet, and relying on the close unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet, we must develop past achievements, thoroughly implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and strive to build a theocratically prosperous, complete, and happy Tibet.

    彻底执行十七条协议，为建设政教两盛圆满幸福的西藏而努力
    西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员　达赖喇嘛
    今天，1957年5月23日，是1951年5月23日中央人民政府和西藏地方政府双方代表们签订关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的六周年。像西藏地区各界人民都在盛大地举行庆祝一样，在这个日子里，我也要对它进行纪念和祝贺。今天，不但要纪念和庆祝协议签订六周年，还需要纪念一下六年以来工作方面所取得的成就。六年来，由于中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导和帮助，中共西藏工委的领导，进藏人民解放军和工作人员的帮助，西藏干部和人民的共同努力，西藏地方的政治、经济和文化各方面都取得了许多进步和向上发展的成绩，其中如像汉藏民族之间的团结、信任和了解有了进步；由于数千公里的航线和公路的开辟，大批西藏地区的干部和青年能够顺利地前往祖国内地去参观学习，使爱国主义思想得以提高；去年西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不但坚固地奠定了藏族享受当家作主和民族平等权利的基础，又进行了一些工业等企业建设，并且还投入了生产。总之，在各方面都取得了有利于西藏的伟大成就。今后大家要在中国共产党、伟大的毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，进藏汉族干部的帮助下，依靠汉藏民族之间和西藏内部的亲密团结，发展过去的成绩，彻底执行十七条协议，为建设政教两盛圆满幸福的西藏而努力。
