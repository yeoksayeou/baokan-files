    Exposing and Resolving Contradictions in Shaanxi Universities
    Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Invites University Professors to Symposium
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) On the afternoon of May 18th, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited some heads and professors of higher education institutions to a symposium. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.

    Yuan Yaoting said: Ideological work in schools is too poor, and non-Party members are not trusted enough.
    Yuan Yaoting, a professor at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, said: In the past, democratic parties played a role at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, but now their role is very small. While this is partly due to excessive politeness, an important reason is also the Party committee's practice of monopolizing and substituting for the work of democratic parties. He said that the Northwestern Polytechnical University was a very good school during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the early days of liberation. However, now, its teaching and research work cannot compare with Northwestern University and Northwestern Agricultural College. In the past, people at the Northwestern Polytechnical University had deep feelings for the institute. However, in the past two years, the situation has changed. Those who have been transferred away do not have good feelings for the institute, and those within the school are also disaffected and want to leave as soon as possible. What is the reason? The ideological work in the school is too poor, especially during each movement, there are people who are wrongly criticized, and after the movement, the leadership does not conduct ideological work on the comrades who have been wronged, but instead pushes the responsibility onto those who have suffered injustice. He said that school leaders also do not respect older teachers enough. There are also many problems in the relationship between the Party and the masses at the Northwestern Polytechnical University. Everyone feels that Party members have too many privileges, which is reflected in grading, further studies, etc. For example, it is very difficult to solve the employment problems of family members of non-Party members, but it is not difficult for the family members of leaders to find jobs. A young teacher (a member of the Communist Youth League) who had just graduated was given a higher salary than some older teachers during the salary evaluation. The Party organization and leadership of the Northwestern Polytechnical University do not trust non-Party members enough. They do not consult with non-Party responsible comrades on matters, but are willing to listen to the opinions of Party and League members. In the past, there was also little consultation with professors on the issue of departmental adjustments. Some more upright people are often labeled as "backward elements" because of their poor speaking attitude.

    He said that central-level institutions are too closed, such as the Ministry of Geology, which does not pay attention to giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm, and uses the word "secret" to close the door everywhere. They have materials but do not let others see them. The Ministry of Geology and the Academy of Sciences invite experts to give lectures and hold professional meetings, but do not allow us to participate. The most serious thing is the stealing of other people's achievements. Some geology teachers from the Northwestern Polytechnical University and Northwestern University discovered an important mineral deposit in a certain area in Shanxi, and the Ministry of Geology has been exploring it for two years, but they do not let us know. The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Higher Education is also very serious, especially the Department of Industrial Education. When discussing problems, they always talk about a lot of other people's faults first, and as a result, the work of departmental adjustments is a complete mess.

    Zhou Yao said: There are many social activities, and research time is not guaranteed.
    Zhou Yao, a professor at the Northwestern Agricultural College, said: Over the past few years, I have wanted to engage in scientific research, but I still cannot conduct scientific research very well today. There are still many social activities. Six-fifths of the time for business and research is not guaranteed. I can only do research on Saturday nights and Sundays. The conditions for conducting scientific research are also very poor. The main thing is that there is a lack of books and reference materials. The books on entomology in the school library are even fewer than my personal collection. The Academy of Sciences only pays attention to strengthening its internal work and forgets to lead and organize scientific workers outside the academy to conduct research.

    There are also some problems in teaching reform. For example, China has a vast territory, and the agricultural production situation is complex, with serious diseases and insect pests. The research on diseases and insects is carried out on different foundations, and China's tradition is also to divide diseases and insects into two specialties. However, the Ministry of Higher Education rigidly learns from the Soviet unified teaching plan, requiring the training of all-round talents who can handle both diseases and insects. As a result, the students trained are not suitable for China's needs.

    The school leaders have sectarianism in the trust and training of cadres. For example, for further studies abroad, some Party members with poor qualifications are sent out even if they fail the exam once or twice, while some non-Party and League members with very good qualifications are not sent out. Those who attend international academic conferences are always experts from Beijing, and scientific workers from other regions do not have the opportunity to go out to study.

    Wang Huanchu said: There are contradictions between teaching and scientific research.
    Wang Huanchu, a professor at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, said: At present, there are contradictions between the teaching and scientific research work of basic course teachers in higher industrial schools. Either scientific research cannot be carried out, or the purpose of scientific research is not clear. How to solve this contradiction? A few days ago, Mr. Hua Luogeng raised the question of whether "science" is closer to "engineering" or closer to "literature" and "law." It is obvious that "science" is closer to "engineering" because "engineering" is a direct application of "science." However, it may not be entirely appropriate to merge the science departments in comprehensive universities into higher industrial schools. I think the science departments of comprehensive universities should focus on pure theoretical research; in higher industrial schools, applied science majors should be gradually established. Of course, it is difficult to set up many majors at once, but in some places with teachers and other conditions, they can be set up gradually in a simple way. Taking the Northwestern Polytechnical University as an example, there is no problem with teachers for setting up an applied mathematics major now, and no money needs to be spent, as long as a few dozen students are enrolled each year. Setting up this major will not only be beneficial to other engineering courses, but also solve the contradiction between the teaching and scientific research of basic course teachers. But I heard that the Ministry of Higher Education does not agree.

    Jiang Sichang said: Party committee governance and professor governance are not in conflict.
    Jiang Sichang, a professor at the Xi'an Military Medical University, said: I have also had the experience of having a position without power. In the past, I was a leader in a hospital. In the beginning, there was no Party committee in this unit. I had a position and power. Later, a Party committee was established, and many things were decided by the Party committee, and my opinion was rarely sought. Now I am the director of a teaching and research section at the Military Medical University, and I have also encountered similar situations. There is also sectarianism at the Military Medical University. For example, in promoting cadres and sending teachers to study abroad, there is a bias towards Party and League members.

    He said: Party and government leaders do not accept the opinions of non-Party members enough. In science, there are many problems because Party and government leaders are limited by their professional level and cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and do not accept other people's opinions. Party leaders who lead scientific workers should strive to study science.

    Regarding the issue of Party committee governance versus professor governance, I don't think there is any conflict. The Party committee is responsible for implementing the Party's policies, and professors specifically do the teaching work. Neither can replace the other. Professors can actively participate in governing the school in the school affairs committee, and the Party committee should give full play to the role of the school affairs committee.

    When talking about the quality of talent training, he said: It is problematic to send students to factories and clinics immediately after graduation. Students should intern in hospitals for three to five years after graduation before being sent to factories or clinics so that they can be of great use.

    Zeng Zhenwu said: The Party and government are indistinguishable in many matters.
    Zeng Zhenwu, the president of the Xi'an Institute of Physical Education, talked about the powers of non-Party leaders and the relationship between the Party and non-Party members at the symposium, and criticized the leadership of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. He said: The current situation in schools is that the leadership of the Party organization and the administrative leadership are confused. In many cases, the Party makes decisions and arrangements. From my own perspective, sometimes when I make a decision that suits the intentions of Party members, it is implemented smoothly, which also shows that I have a position and power. Otherwise, I have no power. I think this problem should have a process of understanding and development, and it needs to be waited for and cannot be forced. I want to exert as much strength as I have. If I can't exert my strength, I won't force it.

    He said: The Xi'an Institute of Physical Education has been established for three years, and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has not yet announced my appointment as president. This can also be said to be bureaucracy of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. Sometimes I think, you transfer me, I will leave, I can't be a president with a bad reputation forever.

    Bi Zhonghan said: Both sides are responsible for the formation of walls and ditches.
    Bi Zhonghan, the vice president of the Xi'an Institute of Power Engineering, said: There is a gap and distance between the Party and intellectuals. The reasons for the formation of walls and ditches: 1. Side effects of various major movements such as the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, ideological reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Many intellectuals are unwilling to speak, and even doubt whether socialism has democracy and freedom. 2. Because some Party cadres are accustomed to the methods of class struggle, they are prone to take a rough attitude and use force to subdue people when dealing with problems, and give you a big label at every turn, which makes some non-Party members even more unwilling to speak. 3. Unequal treatment inside and outside the Party, not treating everyone equally. 4. Not giving intellectuals enough trust and respect. 5. Having a position without power. Both sides are responsible for this. On the one hand, non-Party members themselves believe that their level is low and they dare not take on the responsibilities they should bear. On the other hand, Party comrades do not respect the powers of non-Party members and do not create conditions for non-Party members to work, so they cannot be responsible even if they want to. He also put forward two suggestions: 1. Collect the opinions of non-Party members published in the recent newspapers and organize Party members to read them. Although these opinions are the speeches of a few people, they can represent the opinions of many people. Because Party members must first know what contradictions exist in order to resolve internal contradictions among the people. 2. Educate Party members to correctly understand and earnestly implement the Party's policies in today's implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and to educate and deal with Party members who violate principles in a timely manner.

    揭露和解决陕西高等学校的矛盾
    中共陕西省委邀请高等学校教授座谈
    本报讯　18日下午，中共陕西省委邀请了一部分高等院校的负责人和教授举行座谈。会议由省委第一书记张德生主持。
    袁耀庭说：学校思想工作太差对非党人士不够信任
    西北工学院教授袁耀庭说：过去，民主党派在西北工学院里曾起过一些作用，但是，现在民主党派的作用却很小，这固然是因为相互过于客气；但党委对民主党派工作包办代替的作风也是重要的原因。他说：西北工学院在抗日战争、解放初期是很不错的学校，但是现在无论教学、研究工作都赶不上西北大学和西北农学院，过去，西北工学院的人员都对工学院有深厚的感情。但是，近两年来，情况变了，调走的人员对工学院没有好感，校内的人员也离心离德，都想一走为妙。什么原因？学校思想工作太差，特别是每次运动，都有整错的人，而在运动过后，领导上也不对整错的同志从思想上进行工作，反而把责任推到蒙受冤屈的人身上。他说，学校领导人尊重老教师也是不够的。西北工学院的党群关系上也有很多问题，大家感到党员的特权太多，这表现在评级、进修等方面，例如，非党人员家属的工作问题是很不容易解决的，而领导人员的家属找工作就没有什么困难。一个刚毕业不久的青年教师（团员）在评薪时，评的工资比年老的教师有的还要高。西北工学院党组织和领导上对非党人士是不够信任的。有事情不同非党负责同志商谈，而愿意听党、团员的意见。有关院系调整问题，已往也很少与教授们商量。有一些比较正直的人，往往由于说话态度不好，就被扣上个“落后分子”的帽子。
    他说，中央一级机构关门太紧，如地质部，不注意发挥大家的积极性，处处都用秘密二字关住大门，他们有材料也不让别人看。地质部、科学院请专家讲学，开专业会议，都不准我们参加。最严重的事情是窃夺别人的成果，西北工学院、西北大学有一部分地质教师在山西某地发现一重要矿藏，地质部已勘探两年了，却不让我们知道。高教部的官僚主义也是十分严重的，特别是工业教育司，谈问题时总是先谈别人一大堆不是，而结果在院系调整工作上，弄得一塌糊涂。
    周尧说：社会活动很多，研究时间没保证
    西北农学院教授周尧说：几年来，我很想搞科学研究，但到今天还不能很好地进行科学研究。社会活动还很多。六分之五的从事业务、研究的时间没有保证。只有在星期六晚上和星期天研究。进行科学研究工作的条件也很差。主要是缺少书和参考资料，学校图书馆昆虫学方面的书比我私人的还少。科学院只注意加强自己内部的工作，忘记了领导和组织院外的科学工作者进行研究工作。
    教学改革中也存在一些问题。例如中国地区广大，农业生产的情况复杂，病虫害严重。病和虫的研究是在不同的基础上进行的，我国的传统也是病虫分为二个专业。但高教部却生硬地学习苏联的统一教学计划，要求培养病虫兼顾的全材，结果培养出来的学生不适合我国的需要。
    学校领导对干部的信任、培养，有宗派主义。例如出国进修，有的党员程度差，一次两次考不取，也要想办法送出去，有些程度很好的非党、团员却没有送出去。出席国际间学术会议的永远是北京一些专家，其他地区的科学工作者却没有出去学习的机会。
    王焕初说：教学和科学研究有矛盾
    西北工学院教授王焕初说：现在，高等工业学校基础课教师的教学和科学研究工作有矛盾，不是展不开科学研究，就是科学研究的目的性不明确。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？前几天，华罗庚先生提出“理”近“工”还是近“文”“法”的问题。很明显，“理”是近于“工”的，因为“工”是“理”的直接应用。但是如果把综合大学中的理学院并到高等工业学校中去，也未必完全合适。我认为综合大学的理科，应该偏重于纯理论的研究；在高等工业学校中，则应逐渐设立理科的应用专业。当然一下子设置许多专业是有困难的，但是在一些有师资等条件的地方，便可以因陋就简，逐步设置，拿西北工学院来说，现在设置一个应用数学专业，师资没问题，钱也不用花，只要每年招几十个学生就可以了。设了这个专业以后，不但对其他工科教学有好处，而且可以解决基础课教师教学和科学研究的矛盾。但是听说高教部不同意。
    姜泗长说：党委治校和教授治校并不冲突
    西安军医大学教授姜泗长说：我对有职无权的问题也是有过体会的。过去，我在一个医院里担任领导，开始这个单位里没有党委会，我有职有权，后来成立了党委会，许多事情都由党委会决定了，很少征求我的意见。现在我在军医大学担任教研室主任，也遇到过类似情况。军医大学也有宗派主义。例如提拔干部，派教师留学，都偏重于党团员。
    他说：党政领导对党外人士的意见接受不够。在科学方面，有许多问题因为党政领导受业务水平的限制，不能辨清是非，而没有接受别人的意见。党领导科学的工作人员应该努力学习科学。
    关于党委治校还是教授治校的问题，我认为并不冲突。党委会负责贯彻党的政策，教授具体作教学工作，两者谁也不能代替谁；教授可以在校务委员会里积极参加治校，党委会应该发挥校务委员会的作用。
    在谈到培养人才的质量问题时，他说：现在学生一毕业就派到工厂和医务所去，这做法有问题。学生毕业后应在医院实习三、五年再派到工厂或医务所去，这样才能顶大用。
    曾震五说：很多事情党政不分
    西安体育学院院长曾震五在座谈会上，谈到非党领导人员的职权和党与非党的关系问题，并且对中央体育运动委员会领导上提出了批评意见。他说：现在学校的情况是党组织领导和行政领导混淆了，很多事情党政不分，而多是党来做决定和布置。从我本身来说，有时作了决定，适合党员同志的意图，就执行通了，也就表现了我有职有权，反之，就没有权。我想这个问题应有一个认识的发展过程，需要等待，不能勉强去争。我想，我有多少力量就发挥多少力量。用不上力，也就不勉强。
    他说：西安体育学院成立三年了，到现在中央体委还没有公布我担任院长的职务，这也可以说是中央体委官僚主义。有时我想，你们调我，我就走，我不能老当一个黑名的院长。
    毕仲翰说：形成墙和沟两方面都有责任
    西安动力学院副院长毕仲翰说：党和知识分子之间是有隔膜有距离的。形成墙和沟的原因：一、三反、五反、思想改造、肃反等各项大运动的副作用，很多知识分子不愿说话，甚至怀疑到社会主义是否有民主和自由的问题。二、由于某些党内干部习惯于敌我斗争的方式方法，这样就使他们处理问题易于采取粗暴的态度和以力服人的手段，动辄给你扣上一顶大帽子，这就使一些党外人士更加不愿说话了。三、党内外待遇不平等，不是一视同仁。四、对知识分子未给予足够的信任和尊重。五、有职无权。这固然两方面都有责任。一方面是党外人士自己认为水平低，不敢担负起应负的责任来。另一方面就是党内同志不尊重党外人士的职权，不给党外人士创造工作的条件，因此，想负责任也负不起来。他还提出两项建议：一、把最近报上发表的党外人士的意见集中起来，组织党员阅读，这些意见虽然是一部分人的发言，但是，可以代表很多人的意见。因为党员要解决人民内部矛盾首先要知道存在着那些矛盾。二、教育党员在今天贯彻鸣放方针中，要正确认识和认真执行党的政策，对违反原则的党员要及时教育、处理。
