    Welcome Non-Party Comrades to Help Us Rectify
            By Our Commentator

    Since the start of the rectification movement, some units have adopted some less appropriate methods to mobilize non-Party comrades to participate in the rectification movement. For example, some units asked non-Party members to sign individually to indicate whether they would participate in the rectification; some units' leading cadres repeatedly sought the opinions of non-Party comrades face-to-face, asking them whether they were willing to participate in the rectification, and even mobilized them to participate; some Party member cadres, in front of non-Party comrades, talked about how those who wanted to make progress would definitely participate in the rectification, and that not participating meant being backward, and so on. Although these units did not rigidly stipulate that all non-Party comrades must participate in the rectification, using this method and saying such things would make non-Party comrades feel a kind of pressure, and even if they still had many concerns, or were simply unwilling to participate in the rectification, they would have to reluctantly sign up to participate. This, of course, is not in line with the spirit of the central government's instructions. Regarding these comrades, what we require of non-Party comrades in the rectification movement does not seem very clear.

    The rectification movement is to rectify the Party's ideology and work style. During the rectification movement, what we require of non-Party comrades is to boldly, sharply, and without reservation expose our shortcomings and mistakes in all aspects, and to help Party members carry out rectification. Non-Party comrades can help us rectify by participating in the rectification movement; they can also help us carry out rectification by not participating in the rectification movement. At present, many central government agencies and some local Party organizations are inviting non-Party comrades from all fields to hold various forums to listen to their criticisms of the Party. In fact, this is a very good way to absorb non-Party comrades to participate in the rectification movement. Party organizations can use this form more extensively. Departments can hold forums, and bureaus, divisions, sections, and offices can also hold forums; they can invite responsible persons of democratic parties, senior intellectuals, and non-Party comrades who hold leadership positions to hold forums, and they can also invite ordinary non-Party cadres in the organs to hold forums; the scale of the forums can be large or small, and one can also hear many opinions on the Party by using individual visits and heart-to-heart talks instead of meetings... Therefore, we have no need to force or subtly force non-Party comrades to participate in the rectification. For non-Party comrades who voluntarily participate in the rectification movement, we also first require them to help Party members carry out rectification, rather than first rectifying them. Once this is clarified, we will neither force non-Party comrades to participate in the rectification movement, nor can we promptly dispel the concerns of some non-Party comrades about whether to participate in the rectification, and mobilize them to help us rectify.

    欢迎非党同志帮助我们整风
            本报评论员
    整风运动开始以后，有些单位采取了一些不大恰当的办法去动员非党同志参加整风运动。比如，有些单位让非党员逐个签名表示是否参加整风；有些单位的领导干部再三去当面征求非党同志的意见，问他们是否愿意参加整风，甚至动员他们参加；有些党员干部在非党同志面前，谈论什么要求进步的一定会参加整风，不参加整就是落后等等。虽然，这些单位并没有硬性规定要非党同志一律参加整风，但是，用这种方式，说这样的话，就会使非党同志感受到一种压力，虽然自己还有不少顾虑，或者根本不愿意参加整风，也不得不勉强报名参加。这，当然是不符合中央指示精神的。对于这些同志，在整风运动中，我们所要求于非党同志的是什么，看来还不十分明确。
    整风运动是要整顿党的思想作风。在整风运动期间，我们所要求于非党同志的，是大胆尖锐毫无保留地揭发我们各方面的缺点和错误，帮助党员进行整风。非党同志参加整风运动，可以帮助我们整风；不参加整风运动，也可以帮助我们进行整风。目前，许多中央机关以及一部分地方党组织，都正在邀请各方面的非党同志举行各种座谈会，倾听他们对党的批评。实际上，这就是吸收非党同志参加整风运动的一种很好的形式。党组织可以更广泛地运用这种形式。部可以召开座谈会，局、司、处、科也可以召开座谈会；可以邀请民主党派的负责人、高级知识分子、担任领导工作的非党同志进行座谈，也可以邀请机关中一般的非党干部进行座谈；座谈会的规模可大可小，不用会议形式而用个别的访问谈心也可以听到很多对党的意见……。因此，我们完全没有必要去强迫或变相强迫非党同志参加整风。对于自愿参加整风运动的非党同志，我们也是首先要求他帮助党员进行整风，而不是首先去整他们。弄清楚了这一点，就既不会去强迫非党同志参加整风运动，又可以及时地解除某些非党同志对是否参加整风的顾虑，动员他们帮助我们整风。
