Heavenly Moat Turns into Thoroughfare
——Remembering the "Joining" of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Xu Chi

	These days, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site is experiencing its most joyous festival.

	Festival, sometimes rainy, sometimes sunny. The Yangtze River Bridge stands like a permanent rainbow spanning the city of Wuhan.

	Festival, the city, streets, flowers and trees are clean and spotless, draped in sunlight and sparkling waves. Festival, the beautiful ships on the river are covered with flags; the whole city is flagged; even the rainbow bridge is covered. The radiant crowd is dressed in festive attire.

	Festival, welcoming a state guest. Festival, celebrating International Labor Day. Festival, announcing good news: a great bridge project has been "joined."

	On April 19th, the 40th direct express train from Nanning arrived at Wuchang North Station. A ferry had just left. People from South China had to wait for the next one at the Yuehan Wharf, for as long as an hour.

	In the future, trains will cross the Yangtze River in just one minute via the bridge.

	On the vast river surface, the bridge stands tall. On both banks are a series of arched approach bridges, with the thousand-meter-long X-shaped structured main bridge steel beams in the middle. Within the steel beams, there is still a narrow gap, but it only lacks the "米米米米米" (mi mi mi mi mi) five characters. Each "米" (mi) character is sixteen meters long. This means that on this day, the distance between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River is only eighty meters.

	On the 20th, the director of the bridge project told me that the joining date would be in mid-May.

	On the 21st, the engineer of the First Bridge Section told me: the workers below are requesting that the joining be completed before Labor Day. The request has been sent to the bureau.

	Climbing the approach bridge, looking from this end to that end, just like someone visiting the Summer Palace for the first time admiring the Long Corridor, all the steel beams are like a perspective drawing. One nested within another, extremely deep, it is an astonishing and magnificent view.

	Now, people only see the bridge above the river, not knowing that under each pier there are more than thirty huge pipe piles. All eight piers of the bridge, with three hundred pipe piles, stand like giants under the deep water, rooted on the bedrock, loyal to the heavy responsibility they bear. The weight of tens of thousands of tons of the entire bridge rests on the muscular shoulders of these giants.

	But these giants were not summoned by magic; it was science and technology that created this advanced method of bridge construction, the crystallization of the hard work of Chinese and Soviet bridge builders.

	On the 22nd, at night, a meeting was held in the captain's room on the brightly lit bridge. Gan, the captain of the riveting squad, said that the bureau had agreed to complete the joining around May Day.

	Engineer Luo of the squad then began to calculate: there are still twenty-five shifts until the end of the month, which is enough to assemble and rivet four and a half "米" (mi) characters (half a "米" (mi) character has been assembled these past two days). How to solve the shortage of rivets; how to adjust the cranes; how to ensure quality and safety, etc., he said excitedly, "I'm just afraid that the workers will get too enthusiastic, which will be difficult to handle."

	I asked, "What do you mean by getting too enthusiastic?"

	He said, "I can't describe it," once they get enthusiastic, they just focus wholeheartedly on their work, never resting for a minute, not willing to come down even in a storm, still riding on the steel beams when it's time to stop, losing their temper.

	That's exactly how it was, on the 23rd, only four "米" (mi) characters were left.

	On the 25th, only three "米" (mi) characters were left, the distance between the two banks of the Yangtze River was no more than forty-eight meters.

	On the 27th, only two "米" (mi) characters were left, people could talk to each other across the river.

	On the 28th, a bracket extended from Pier No. 6 on the opposite side. The steel structure bracket, also like a giant, stood with its feet on the lower part of the pier, its body lunging outward, one hand grasping the top of the pier, the other hand extended to meet the steel beam coming from the opposite side.

	The agile and nimble assembly workers, without panic, filled the gap in the high rainbow above the great river.

	At 6:00 PM, one of the lower chords on this side was placed on the bracket on the other side.

	Technically speaking, at this point the steel beam had safely reached the opposite bank. The main project of the entire bridge was successful at the moment it was placed on the bracket.

	Of course, it was still a single piece of material high in the air, suspended, like a single-log bridge, one misstep and you would fall straight to the bottom of the river. But the assembly workers were walking back and forth between the two banks on this lower chord.

	The joyous festival began. On the 29th, at the construction site, on the approach bridge, at the steel beam joining point, workers welcomed the Soviet head of state, applauding and cheering. May 1st, the grand parade. They also have a festival within a festival – the joining day. That in itself is a festival.

	This is the last "米" (mi) character. It is waiting, waiting for a bright sunny day, for the film crews from Beijing and Shanghai film studios to send their teams. The color film will invite audiences across the country to watch the assembly of this last "米" (mi) character.

	"Joining" is the end of the steel beam project. But after that, there are countless other projects: elevators, trolleybus lines, marble halls, sculptures, railings for viewing the great river; and also the railway hub station; and others. The entire bridge will be open to traffic in another six months, but it has been advanced by more than a year. And before that, how much engineering and labor there was! The preliminary design began in the spring of 1950, and geological drilling continued until after the 1954 flood season; the foundation work was once as tense and intense as a battle; the steel beam project also encountered worrying difficulties. Only at this moment can everyone relax, can everyone's heart bloom.

	Congratulations on reaching the summit, the bridge has been "joined"! Congratulations on a festival for our country's construction cause!

	Congratulations to the bridge builders, when you climb to the top of the bridge, you have reached a peak of world bridge technology. Of course, you will climb even higher peaks!

	Congratulations to all those who travel across the bridge, the vehicles that travel across the bridge, and the ships that travel under the bridge. The beautiful bridge makes all who see it feel happy! The magnificent bridge makes all who breathe the fresh air of the river feel heroic and filled with confidence!

	Congratulations, to the bridge that symbolizes Sino-Soviet friendship. This is a bridge to socialism! This is a triumphal arch, the triumphal arch of the first Five-Year Plan of the new China!

	Congratulations! (Attached picture)

    天堑变通途
    ——记武汉长江大桥的“合龙”
    本报特约记者　徐迟
    这些日子，在武汉长江大桥工地上，过的是最欢乐的节日。
    节日，时雨、时晴。长江大桥像永久的虹霓，跨在武汉市上空。
    节日，城市、街道、花木都清洁无垢，披着阳光和闪闪的波光。节日，江上的漂亮的船舰上挂满了旗帜；满城旗帜；虹霓上也挂满了。容光焕发的人群都穿上节日的盛装。
    节日，欢迎一位国宾。节日，庆祝国际劳动节。节日，报喜讯：一个伟大的桥梁工程“合龙”了。
    4月19日，从南宁开来的第四十次直快列车到达武昌北站。一班轮渡刚开走。从南中国来的人全得在粤汉码头上等候上一班，达一小时之久。
    将来列车从桥上通过长江只要一分钟。
    在苍茫的江面，桥挺立着。两岸各有一系列的圆穹形引桥，中间是千多公尺长的米字形结构的正桥钢梁。钢梁中，还有一狭隘缺口，却只缺“米米米米米”五个字了。每个米字之长十六公尺。这就是说，这一天，长江南北两岸的距离，只不过八十公尺。
    20日，大桥工程局长告诉我，合龙日期是5月中旬。
    21日，第一桥梁处的工程师告诉我：下面的工人要求在五一节以前合龙。要求已经送到局里去了。
    登引桥，从这头，望那头，正像第一次游颐和园的人见到长廊要赞叹不已，全部钢梁像一幅透视图。一个套一个，进深极了，是惊人的宏伟景色。
    现在，人们只见江水之上的桥，不知道每个桥墩下有三十多根巨大的管柱。全桥八个桥墩，三百来个管柱，像巨人一样，屹立在深水底下，它们生根在岩盘上，忠心于它们担负的重任。全桥几万吨重量都压在这些巨人的肌肉发达的肩膀上。
    却不是魔法召来了这些巨人，是科学技术创造了这建筑桥梁的先进方法，是中苏桥梁建设者的心血结晶。
    22日，夜晚，在灯火辉煌的桥上，队长室里开了一个会。拼铆中队甘队长说，局里面已同意在五一前后合龙。
    中队的罗工程师便计算起来：到月底还有二十五个班，是来得及拼铆四个半米字的（这两天又拼装好半个米字了）。缺铆钉如何解决；吊车如何调动；质量和安全如何保证等等，说得他兴奋起来，“只怕工人们劲头来了，不好办。”
    我问：“劲头来了，是怎么的？”
    他说：“我不会描写”，劲头一来，反正一心一意干，一分一秒不歇，有风暴也不肯下，到了点还骑在钢梁上，出了性子。
    正是这样的，23日，只差四个米字了。
    25日，只差三个米字，长江两岸不过四十八公尺的距离了。
    27日，只差二个米字，人们隔江对话。
    28日，从对面六号墩上，伸出了一个托架来。钢结构的托架，也像一个巨人，足踏在桥墩下部，身子往外扑出来，一手攀住桥墩顶部，另一手伸出来，迎接对面架过来的钢梁。
    拼装工人有矫健灵活的身段，不慌不忙在大江之上，把高高霓虹中的一个缺口补上了。
    下午六时，这边的一根下弦杆放到了那边的托架上。
    从技术上来讲，这时钢梁已安全到达对岸。在它放托架的一瞬间，全桥的主要工程已告成功。
    当然，它还是高空中单独一根杆件，是凌空的，是独木桥，一个不踏实就直下江底去了。但拼装工人在这下弦杆上，两岸之间来来往往。
    欢乐的节日开始了。29日，工地上，引桥上，钢梁的接龙处，工人们迎接苏联元首，鼓掌欢呼。5月1日，大游行。他们还有一个节日中的节日——合龙日。那本身就是一个节日。
    这是最后的一个米字。它在等待着，等待个阳光明丽的日子，从北京和上海的电影厂送来了摄影队。彩色胶卷上，将邀请全国观众前来观赏这最后一个米字的拼装。
    “合龙”是钢梁工程的结束。但后面，还有无数工程，电梯、无轨电车线、大理石大厅、雕塑、眺望大江的恁栏处；还有铁路枢纽站；还有别的。全桥通车，还得半年光景，但已提前一年多。而前面是多少工程和多少劳动啊！初步设计是1950年春就开始的，地质钻探直到1954年汛期后；基础工程，曾经像战斗一样的紧张，激烈；钢梁工程也发生过令人焦灼的困难。只在此刻，才人人放了心，才人人心花怒放。
    祝贺，顶点的到达，大桥“合龙”了！祝贺，我国建设事业的一个节日！
    祝贺，桥梁建设者，当你们登上大桥顶，你们登上了世界桥梁技术的一个高峰。当然，你们还会攀登更高的峰顶的！
    祝贺，所有行经桥上的人，行经桥上的车辆和行经桥下的船只。美丽的桥，使所有看到它的眼睛感到了幸福！宏伟的桥，使所有呼吸着江上清风的心胸感到了豪迈，充塞了信心！
    祝贺，象征中苏友谊的桥。这是通往社会主义的桥！这是一座凯旋门，新中国第一个五年计划的凯旋门！
    祝贺！（附图片）
