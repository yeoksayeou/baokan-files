Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 12th: Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, further exposed the acts of betrayal of the people's democratic system by the former Nagy Imre government during the October events last year at a meeting of the National Assembly on the 9th.

In his summary report on the work of the Presidium of the People's Republic since the parliamentary recess in August last year, Dobi said that before October last year, the Hungarian Working People's Party had already taken significant steps to correct errors and accelerate the democratization of socialism. After the National Assembly meeting in August, the Presidium worked according to the good suggestions put forward by the Party, and we were preparing to convene a parliamentary meeting on October 29th, but it could not be realized due to the counter-revolutionary events.

According to the Constitution, the Presidium elected Nagy as Chairman of the Council of Ministers on October 24th last year, and on the 25th, it elected a Council of Ministers composed of twenty-four people, and later supplemented it with two Ministers of State. At that time, it could already be seen that the government leaders wanted to handle state affairs in a smaller circle. Later, they abolished the ministers of various ministries and the vice-chairmen of the Council of Ministers, leaving only the chairman and three ministers of state. In addition, representatives of six newly established parties were appointed as ministers of state, and Maléter was appointed as Minister of Defense. Maléter did not want to maintain the People's Government, and Nagy knew this very well.

At the same time that Nagy was elected Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the country still had the army, police, and security forces. If Nagy had really intended to defend the people's power, he could have made most of the military and police persist, but he took measures to disintegrate the military and police.

Dobi said that Kádár repeatedly demanded opposition to the white terror, but Nagy and his ilk did not mention this at all. When Kádár saw that he could not count on the Nagy government to defeat the counter-revolution, he took action. He and several loyal political friends visited the Soviet army and requested assistance. They did not do this for themselves, but for the Hungarian people. Therefore, Hungary now has a people's government.

Socialism can also be built under a multi-party system, and there are precedents for this, but there must be the intention to build socialism, and Nagy and his ilk did not require this guarantee.

How did the Nagy government's turn to the right occur? First, the Communist professional ministers were excluded, and anti-Soviet activities were further carried out; second, a military dictatorship headed by Maléter was planned; and third, it was also reflected in the handling of various parties, paying special attention to Mindszenty's party and wanting to invite them to join the government. Nagy wanted to befriend the right wing through Mindszenty, and finally, in a radio speech, he demanded that land rights be returned to the landlords.

An important anti-Soviet step was the declaration of neutrality. Nagy and his ilk were well prepared. After making the decision at the meeting, they immediately distributed the leaflets that had already been printed. Another important step was to ask the United Nations to guarantee Hungarian neutrality and withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. The Nagy government was based on counter-revolution, so it was bound to fail in the end. After I returned to the office, I was never invited to attend Nagy's cabinet meetings again. I saw people I didn't recognize in the parliament. I repeatedly heard that some people advocated getting rid of me. Before dawn on November 4th, I was taken to a basement by a Horthy officer. Before it was clear why I was taken here, the Soviet army appeared. Nagy had already gone to the Yugoslav embassy, and the counter-revolution ended in the parliament building.

The Nagy government had clearly endangered the national and social system of the Hungarian People's Republic. Therefore, on November 4th, the Presidium withdrew its trust in the Nagy government, dissolved the government, and appointed Kádár as Prime Minister and Münnich as Deputy Prime Minister in accordance with the Constitution.

Dobi said that based on my experience of working with the leaders of the Socialist Workers' Party since November 4th last year, I believe that they are determined to learn from the achievements and mistakes of the past and formulate policies. The establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has opened a new page in Hungarian history.

    道比揭发前纳吉政府背叛人民的罪行
    据新华社布达佩斯12日电　匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比9日在国民议会会议上进一步揭发了前纳吉·伊姆雷政府在去年十月事件中的背叛人民民主制度的行为。
    道比在人民共和国主席团自去年8月议会休会以来的工作总结报告中说，在去年十月以前，匈牙利劳动人民党内已经采取了重大步骤来纠正错误，加速社会主义的民主化。在8月国民议会会议以后，主席团便根据党提出的好的建议进行工作，我们准备在10月29日召开国会会议，但是由于反革命事件而未能实现。
    主席团根据宪法，于去年10月24日选举纳吉为部长会议主席，25日又选举了由二十四人组成的部长会议，后来补选了两个国务部长。那时，已经可以看出政府领导人想在较小的圈子里处理国家事务，后来，他们又取消了各部部长和部长会议副主席，只剩下了主席和三个国务部长。此外，又任命了六个新成立的党派的代表为国务部长，并任命马勒特为国防部长。马勒特并不希望保持人民政府，这一点纳吉知道得很清楚。
    与纳吉当选为部长会议主席的同时，国家还有军队、警察和保安队，如果纳吉当真有心要保卫人民政权的话，他也可以让大部分军警坚持下来，但是他采取了瓦解军警的措施。
    道比说，卡达尔一再要求反对白色恐怖，而纳吉之流却根本不提这回事，当卡达尔看到根本不能指望纳吉政府打败反革命时，他采取了行动，他同几个忠实的政治朋友去访问苏军，请求援助。他们不是为了自己，而是为了匈牙利人民，因此，现在匈牙利才有了人民政权。
    在多党制下，也可以建设社会主义，这是有先例可援的，但是必须有建设社会主义的意图，而纳吉之流并不要求有这个保证。
    纳吉政府向右转是怎样出现的呢？首先是排斥共产党的专业部长，进一步地进行反苏活动；其次是筹划建立以马勒特为首的军事专政；再次还表现在对各种党派的处理上，特别注意明曾蒂的党，想请他们参加政府。纳吉想通过明曾蒂来与右派交朋友，最后他在广播演说里要求把土地权还给地主。
    反苏的重要步骤是宣布中立，纳吉之流准备得很好，在会议上作了决定之后，立即就分发原先已经印刷好了的传单。另一个重要步骤是，要求联合国保证匈牙利中立，退出华沙条约。纳吉政府是以反革命为基础的，所以最后必然要走到失败地步。我回到了办公室以后，再也没有请我去参加纳吉内阁会议，国会中出现了不认识的人，我一再听说，有人主张摆脱我。在11月4日天亮以前，我被一个霍尔蒂军官带进了一间地下室。还没有弄清究竟为什么把我带到这里来，苏军就出现了，纳吉已经走到南斯拉夫大使馆去了，反革命在国会大厦中结束了。
    纳吉政府显然已经危害了匈牙利人民共和国国家和社会制度，主席团于是在11月4日撤销了对纳吉政府的信任，解散了这个政府，并且根据宪法任命了卡达尔为总理、明尼赫为副总理。
    道比说，根据我在去年11月4日以来和社会主义工人党领导人一起工作的体会，我相信他们有决心从过去的成就和错误中吸取教训而订出政策。工农革命政府的成立，在匈牙利历史上揭开了新的一页。
