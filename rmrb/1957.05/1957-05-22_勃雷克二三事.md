    Two or Three Things About Blake
    Yuan Kejia
    Blake lived a life of poverty, yet he excelled in both poetry and painting. However, he did not believe that poetry necessarily requires poverty to be great. In a note about "The Vision of the Last Judgment" in 1810, he said: "Some people and many artists assert that if a painter received proper encouragement, he would not paint so well. People who hold this view should consider the poverty and lack of artistic talent in some countries. Although art is not limited by both, it is better to ask for abundance than to ask for poverty; although a person will not become a greater artist because of wealth, he can produce greater works commensurate with his wealth." In a letter to painter Thomas Cumberland on December 23, 1795, he also expressed the same view: "Peace, affluence, and domestic happiness are the source of noble art; the food of reason is 'enjoyment' rather than 'asceticism.'"
    Blake firmly believed that art has great educational significance. He painted historical paintings not to imitate the past, but to use the past to reflect on the present. He believed that a painting depicting the death of a wicked person should not only serve as a decoration, but also as a warning to other wicked people. In his words, it must be "a decoration and a warning."
    Blake also had a similarly high estimation of the role of poets. He believed that the social and moral power aroused by poets through their works was enough to overwhelm all evil tyrants. He collectively referred to those poems expressing his sympathy for the American Revolution and the French Revolution, and opposing wars of aggression and autocratic persecution, as "Prophetic Books," which indicates that poems not only have a reflective effect on the development of real life, but also have a guiding significance. The so-called "prophet" here, of course, cannot be used in the mystical sense. Blake had already made it clear: "Every honest man is a prophet, he expresses his opinions on public and private affairs." More than a hundred years later, many of his prophecies are especially profound in meaning when read today. For example, he said at the end of the poem "America": "The empire is ended, and jackals and tigers will disappear..." Isn't this a wonderful elegy for the decline of imperialism today?
    Blake liked to make marginal notes while reading, and sometimes a few short words could express his feelings. He wrote in the "Essays of Bacon": "Everyone hates the tyrant, because he is the worst disease, the root of all evil." The earliest of his poems against tyrants was the ballad "King Gwin of Norway," written before he was twenty. After describing the cruel rule of the tyrant Gwin and the exploitation of the poor by the nobles, the poet issued a resounding call:
    The land is desolate, wives and children,
    Cry for bread;
    Arise, let Gwin be disgraced,
    Overthrow the tyrant.
    This idea of opposing autocratic oppression is often linked to the idea of opposing wars of aggression and demanding human equality, and runs through many of Blake's poems and paintings. His early dramatic poem "Edward III" used the story of a tyrant in history to satirize George III, who was ruling England at the time. His ridicule of Queen Marie Antoinette of France is also excellent. Because the reactionary political commentator Edmund Burke once described the queen as an unparalleled beauty, saying she was: "The loveliest thing I ever saw on earth. I thought she was not made of human flesh". Blake counterattacked in an unfinished ballad. He said:
    The French Queen touched this globe,
    The plague spread under her dragon robe.
    And also said:
    Lafayette saw the Queen smile,
        Her charming eyes flashed;
    He immediately saw the plague rushing
        Rampant on every street.
    It is said that this queen once advised poor people who could not afford bread to eat snacks to satisfy their hunger. Let's listen to Blake's comments:
    Let the brothels of Paris open,
        Dance a charming dance,
    Let the plague spread throughout the city,
        Said the beautiful Queen of France.
    (Note) Lafayette, a leading figure in the new "National Guard" during the French Revolution, initially sympathized with the revolution, but later defected to the royal family.
    This refers to his defection to the royal family.

    勃雷克二三事
  　袁可嘉
    勃雷克一生清寒，而诗画双绝。但他并不认为诗必穷而后工。1810年他在关于“末日审判的幻景”一则笔记中说：“有一部分人和不少艺术家断言某个画家如果获得适当的鼓励，他就不会画得那样出色了。抱有这种见解的人应当想一想某些国家贫困和缺乏艺术人才的情况。虽然艺术不受两者的限制，但要求富足总比要求贫困好；虽然一个人不会由于富有而成为一个更为伟大的艺术家，他却能产生与他财富相当的较为伟大的作品。”1795年12月23日他给画家汤李斯·肯伯兰的信中也表示了同样的见解：“和平，富足和天伦之乐是崇高的艺术之源；理智的粮食是‘享受’而不是‘禁欲’。”
    勃雷克确信艺术有巨大的教育意义。他绘历史画，目的不在复古，而在以古喻今。他认为一张描写恶人之死的画，一方面固然要起艺术品的装饰作用，一方面也要成为对其它恶人的警告。用他的话说：必须是“一种装饰和一个警告。”
    勃雷克对于诗人的作用也有同样崇高的估价。他认为诗人通过作品所激起的社会上和道德上的力量足以压倒万恶的暴君。他把表达自己对于美国革命和法国大革命同情，反对侵略战争和专制迫害的那些诗篇总称为“先知书”（或“预言书”），这就表示诗篇对现实生活的发展不仅有反映的作用，而且有指导的意义。这里所谓“先知”当然不能沿用神秘主义的说法，勃雷克早已说得一清二楚：“每个诚实人都是先知，他对公私事务发表他的意见。”事隔一百多年，他的许多预言在今天读来尤其具有深刻的意义。例如他在“美国”一诗的结尾中说道：“帝国完蛋了，豺狼虎豹就要绝迹……”。这话在今天不也正是帝国主义日暮途穷的绝妙的挽歌吗？
    勃雷克生平读书，好作旁批，有时虽短短数语，却颇能道出他的心情。他在“培根论文集”中批道：“人人憎恨暴君，因为他是最坏的疾病，是一切的祸根。”他反对暴君的诗作最早一篇当推二十岁前写的“挪威王格温”那首歌谣。在描述了暴君格温的残酷统治，贵族剥削穷人的情况以后，诗人发出了响亮的号召：
    土地荒了，妻儿，
    为面包哀号；
    起来，让格温受辱，
    把暴君打倒。
    这种反对专制压迫的思想常常和反对侵略战争要求人类平等的思想联系在一起，贯串在勃雷克许多诗作和画品之中。他早年的诗剧“爱德华三世”就借历史上一位暴君的故事来讽刺当时统治英国的乔治三世。他对法国路易十六皇后的挖苦也很出色。因为当时反动的政论家勃克（E·Burke）曾经把那位皇后形容为绝代佳人，说她是：“人世从未见过的美人，仿佛不食人间烟火”。勃雷克便在一首没有完成的歌谣中予以反击。他说：
    法国皇后一碰这个地球，
    龙袍之下瘟疫不胫而走。又说：
    法叶特（注）瞧见皇后一笑，
        她那媚眼飞盼；
    他马上看到瘟疫飞奔
        满街满巷泛滥。据说这位皇后曾经劝过没钱买面包的穷人改吃点心充饥。我们且听勃雷克的评论：
    让巴黎的窑子敞开，
        跳起迷人的舞蹈，
    让瘟疫流行全市，
        法国的美皇后说道。
    （注）法叶特，法国大革命期间曾是新“国民警卫军”的领导人物，起初同情革命，后来投靠皇室。
    此处系指他投靠皇室以后而言。
