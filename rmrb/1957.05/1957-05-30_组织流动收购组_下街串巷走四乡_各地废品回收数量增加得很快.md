    Organize Mobile Purchasing Groups: Going Door-to-Door in Cities and Countryside
    The Amount of Waste Product Recycling Increases Rapidly

    (By our reporter) Since this spring, all parts of the country have widely publicized the recycling and utilization of waste products, actively organized social forces, and adopted various methods convenient to the masses to carry out waste product purchasing work. Beijing organized 500 waste product stall merchants from March onwards, dispatched 180 mobile purchasing vehicles, and went door-to-door to purchase waste products. By April 15th, a total of 2 million catties of waste metal, rags, waste paper, waste rubber, broken glass, and broken shoes had been purchased. In Zhejiang Province, many counties have increased the variety of recycled items to varying degrees this year. For example, Shangyu County added 18 kinds, and Putuo County expanded from the original 29 kinds to 130 kinds. The purchasing volume of Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other cities in March increased by 1.5 to 4 times compared to February. The purchasing volume of Jiangsu Province in March increased by 91.5% compared to February. Wuxian and other places have also expanded the purchasing and processing of old wooden furniture and used clothing. The Yuxi County No. 2 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yunnan Province achieved good results by exhibiting samples for door-to-door purchasing. For example, the wife of Xie Jianing had one kilogram of shell casings stored away, but she was afraid to sell them. After seeing that the samples brought by the purchasing agent also included shell casings, she brought them out to sell. In addition to having 71 local stores and 116 local agricultural cooperative cadres responsible for purchasing waste products, the Guan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shandong Province also organized 75 mobile purchasing and supply groups to go to the countryside, and used 637 sales agents, part-time sales agents, and temporary seasonal peddlers to go door-to-door in the countryside to purchase and supply goods. The variety of purchased items increased from 65 in January to 125 in March.

    The waste products recycled in various places have played an important role in supporting production, increasing people's income, and supporting farmers in disaster areas to overcome famine. However, the purchasing of some important industrial raw materials such as scrap copper and tin-lead has not been good enough during this period, and it is necessary to further strengthen this work.

    组织流动收购组　下街串巷走四乡
    各地废品回收数量增加得很快
    本报讯　今年春季以来，全国各地广泛地开展了回收利用废品的宣传，积极组织社会力量，采用各种便利群众的方法开展了废品收购工作。北京市从3月份起，组织废品业座摊商五百人，派出流动收购车一百八十辆，下街串巷收购废品。到4月15日止，共收购了废五金、破布、烂纸、废胶、破玻璃、破鞋等二百万斤。浙江省很多县今年回收品种都有了不同程度的增加。如上虞县增加了十八种，普陀县由原来的二十九种扩大为一百三十种。嘉兴、湖州等市3月份的收购额比2月份增加了一倍半到四倍。江苏省3月份的收购额较2月份增加91.5％。吴县等地还扩大了旧木器、估衣等品种的收购和加工。云南省玉溪县二区供销社通过展览样品的方法，上门收购，效果很好。如谢家宁之妻存有一公斤弹壳，不敢拿出来卖，看到收购员带的样品中也有弹壳后，才拿出来卖了。山东省冠县供销社除了通过全县七十一个下店和一百一十六个下社（农业社）的干部负责收购废品，还组织了七十五个下乡流动收购供应小组，并利用六百三十七名经销、代销和临时季节性收购小贩，下乡串户收购和供应，收购品种由1月份六十五种到3月份增为一百二十五种。
    各地回收的废品对支援生产，增加人民收入，支援灾区农民生产度荒，都起了重要作用。但是这一时期有些重要的工业原料如杂铜、锡铅等的收购情况还不够好，需要进一步加强这方面的工作。（李怀瑞）
