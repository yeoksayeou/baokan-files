    Chinese Philosophy History Work Conference Closes
    Yesterday's Discussion Focused on Data Compilation and Publication Issues
    (Our report) The Chinese Philosophy History Work Conference closed yesterday afternoon. Yesterday's meeting focused on discussing how to compile and publish materials on the history of Chinese philosophy.
    Attendees generally criticized the erroneous idea of ​​disregarding data work. Wang Weiting, Wu Ziyu, Zhou Fucheng, and others believed that data work is part of research work, with its own independent scientific value and scientific status, not simply serving the purpose of writing philosophy history. Xiao Shewen, a student representative from the Peking University Philosophy Department, said that data work is not only the foundation of research work but also a good way to prevent dogmatism and simplification.
    Most of the speeches made at the meeting put forward many suggestions on the scope, types, and bibliography of future work on compiling and publishing ancient books. In order to promote this work, some people suggested establishing a Chinese Philosophy History Society and an Ancient Books Compilation Committee, which was supported by many people. Wang Ming, Rong Zhaozu, Zhou Fucheng, and others believed that there was a lot of work to be done, and there were also many difficulties involved. Therefore, it should not be done solely by the state, nor could it be done by a few people. The nation's efforts should be organized to do it, and priorities should be given to the more important and urgent tasks. Wang Ming suggested finding out the base of human resources, considering the possible manpower, assigning clear tasks, and stipulating completion deadlines, so as not to let the plan fail. He also suggested running a "Chinese Philosophy History Research Newsletter" as a tool for academic communication and a forum for debate, in order to change the current harmful situation of mutual isolation between regions and research units.
    Xu Diaofu of the Ancient Books Publishing House introduced the work of the publishing house at the meeting and listened to everyone's opinions.
    Feng Youlan finally spoke, saying that this meeting had achieved its intended purpose and provided favorable conditions for future, larger-scale discussions. Regarding the specific methods of future work, he announced that they would be specifically discussed and decided by some members of the three convening units and several comrades from other places.

    中国哲学史工作会议闭幕
    昨日讨论资料整理出版问题
    本报讯　中国哲学史工作会议昨日下午闭幕。昨日会议集中讨论了如何整理出版中国哲学史资料的问题。
    与会者普遍对于目前存在的轻视资料工作的错误思想提出了批评。王维亭、吴则虞、周辅成等都认为资料工作是研究工作的一部分，本身有其独立的科学价值和科学地位，不是单纯为编写哲学史服务的。北大哲学系学生代表萧箑文说，资料工作不但是研究工作的基础，而且是防止教条主义和简单化毛病的好办法。
    会上绝大部分的发言，对今后进行古籍资料整理出版工作的范围、种类、书目等提出了不少的建议。为了推进这一工作，有人建议成立中国哲学史学会和古籍整理委员会，得到了很多人的赞同。王明、容肇祖、周辅成等认为需要做的工作是很多的，其间也有很多的困难，因此既不能单纯依靠国家来做，也不是指靠少数人能办得了的，应该组织全国的力量来做，而且要分别轻重缓急。王明建议要摸清人力的底子，考虑可能的人力，分配明确的任务，规定完成的期限，这样才不致会使计划落空。他并建议办一个“中国哲学史研究通讯”刊物，作为学术上联系的工具和争鸣的园地，以改变目前这种各地区、各研究单位之间互不通气的有害情况。
    古籍出版社的徐调孚在会上介绍了该社的工作情况，并听取大家的意见。
    冯友兰最后发言，表示这次会达到了预期的目的，对将来更大型的讨论会提供了有利条件。关于今后工作的具体办法，他宣布将由三个召集单位的部分人员和外地来的几位同志具体商讨决定。
