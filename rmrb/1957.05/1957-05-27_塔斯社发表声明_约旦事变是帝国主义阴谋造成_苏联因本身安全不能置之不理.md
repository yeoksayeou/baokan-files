Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 26th: TASS issued a statement on May 25th regarding the situation in Jordan, saying that Soviet leaders have declared that the Soviet Union deeply hopes for peace and security in the Middle East. It was also stated some time ago that the Soviet Union cannot ignore the situation in Jordan, which has been formed due to imperialist conspiracies, because the situation in the Middle East, which borders the Soviet Union, cannot but affect the security of the Soviet Union.

The statement said that a constant stream of facts are emerging daily, proving that the Jordanian incident is the product of a colonialist conspiracy. They are relying on extremely reactionary forces within Jordan, determined to break the resistance of the Jordanian people and impose new colonial shackles on them in the form of the infamous "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine."

The statement said that the interview with King Hussein of Jordan disseminated by the United Press International a few days ago cannot be ignored. This interview attempts to shield the real culprits of the Jordanian incident while slandering the Soviet Union's policy towards Middle Eastern countries. The interview portrays the Jordanian incident as a result of "Soviet Communist" activities, or as a "state of chaos" caused by some Soviet actions. Naturally, King Hussein is well aware that everything he said about the Soviet Union has nothing in common with reality.

The statement said that everyone knows that the Soviet Union strictly adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries in its foreign policy. The Soviet Union believes that the Jordanian people, like the people of all other countries, have the right to decide on their own internal affairs. However, the Jordanian incident is not a product of internal development in that country, but a result of foreign brutal interference.

The Soviet Union only hopes that the Jordanian people will have smooth sailing and success on their path of independent national development. The Soviet Union was, and still is, a consistent and faithful friend of the Arab people. When the independence of the Arab people and world peace were seriously threatened by the Suez Canal incident, the Soviet Union practically proved that it was such a friend.

The statement said that, as for the Soviet Union's economic relations with Arab countries, no matter what King Hussein said in his interview with reporters, the fact is that the Soviet Union treats the needs of Arab countries, including Jordan, with full understanding. The Soviet Union has provided and is willing to provide as much assistance as possible to the people of the East who have freed themselves from the oppression of colonialism - assistance based on equality, respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. Everyone is clearly aware that Jordan has not requested economic assistance from the Soviet Union. This shows that attempts to cast doubt on the motives of the Soviet Union in providing economic assistance to Middle Eastern countries are unfounded.

The statement said that the instigators of the Jordanian incident clearly dislike the Soviet Union's peaceful and friendly policy towards Arab countries, because this policy is a stumbling block in the path of colonialists and certain groups in Arab countries who are prepared to arbitrarily sell out the interests of their own countries to please American millionaires.

The statement said that every honest person cannot fail to see that the true intention of the recent Jordanian incident is to turn Jordanian territory into a nest for new sabotage and adventures against the freedom and independence of Arab countries, and to try to drag Jordan and other Arab countries into aggressive military blocs that are completely contrary to the national interests of these countries.

The statement said that an open reactionary dictatorship has been established in Jordan, the purpose of which is to suppress all patriotic forces and everything progressive. In all these events, American imperialist groups are operating behind the scenes, and here, as everywhere else, they are the backers of colonial tyranny and reactionaries.

### 塔斯社发表声明  约旦事变是帝国主义阴谋造成  苏联因本身安全不能置之不理

    塔斯社发表声明
    约旦事变是帝国主义阴谋造成
    苏联因本身安全不能置之不理
    据新华社莫斯科26日电　塔斯社5月25日发表关于约旦局势的声明说，苏联领导人声明，苏联深切地期望中近东地区能得到和平和安全。前些时也曾经声明过，苏联对由于帝国主义阴谋而形成的约旦局势不能置之不理，因为，同苏联接壤的中近东地区的局势不能不影响苏联的安全。
    声明说，层出不穷的事实每天传来，证明约旦事变是殖民主义者阴谋的产物，他们依靠着约旦内部极端反动的势力，决心打破约旦人民的反抗，并且以臭名远扬的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的形式，给约旦人民戴上新的殖民主义枷锁。
    声明说，不能忽视美国合众社在前几天所散布的约旦国王侯赛因的谈话。这次谈话企图庇护约旦事件的真正祸首，同时诽谤苏联对中近东国家的政策。谈话中把约旦事件描绘成“苏联共产主义”活动的结果，或者又是什么苏联的行动所引起的“混乱状态”的结果。自然，侯赛因国王十分清楚，他所说的关于苏联的一切是同实际情况毫无共同之处的。
    声明说，大家都知道，苏联在自己的外交政策方面严格遵守不干涉别国内政的原则。苏联认为，约旦人民和其他各国人民一样，有权自己决定自己国家的内政。但是，约旦事件不是这个国家内部发展的产物，而是外国粗暴干涉的结果。
    苏联只是希望约旦人民在他们的独立的民族发展的道路上一帆风顺和获得成功。苏联过去是，现在仍然是阿拉伯人民始终如一的和忠实的朋友，当阿拉伯人民的独立和世界和平由于苏伊士运河事件而遭到严重威胁的时候，苏联就实际证明了它是这样的朋友。
    声明说，至于谈到苏联同阿拉伯各国的经济关系，无论侯赛因国王在答记者问时怎样说，事实是苏联本着充分体谅的态度对待阿拉伯国家的需要，其中包括约旦的需要。苏联已经对推翻殖民主义压迫求得解放的东方人民给予尽可能的帮助——在平等、尊重主权、互不干涉内政和互利的基础上的帮助，今后还愿意给予这种帮助。大家清楚知道，约旦并没有要求苏联给予经济援助。这说明，打算对苏联给予中近东国家经济援助的动机散播怀疑的企图是毫无根据的。
    声明说，约旦事件的煽动者显然不喜欢苏联对阿拉伯国家的和平友好政策，因为这种政策是横在殖民主义者和阿拉伯国家中有些准备任意出卖本国利益以讨好于美国亿万富翁的集团的道路上的绊脚石。
    声明说，每一个正直的人都不能不看到，不久前发生的约旦事件的真正用意是想把约旦领土变为对阿拉伯国家的自由和独立进行新的破坏和冒险的窠穴，是力图把约旦和其他阿拉伯国家拉入完全违反这些国家的民族利益的侵略性军事集团。
    声明说，在约旦已经建立了公开的反动独裁，它的宗旨就是镇压一切爱国力量和一切进步的东西。在所有这些事件中，都有美国帝国主义集团在幕后活动，他们在这里也如同在所有地方一样，是殖民暴政和反动派的靠山。
