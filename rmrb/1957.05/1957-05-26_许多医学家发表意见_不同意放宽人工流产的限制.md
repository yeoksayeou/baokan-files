Many Medical Experts Express Opinions
Disagreeing with Relaxing Restrictions on Induced Abortion

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) At the group meetings of the Biology Department of the Second Academic Assembly of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the 24th and 25th, many medical experts expressed their opinions on the Ministry of Health's May 15th notice regarding relaxing restrictions on induced abortion.

    Lin Qiaozhi, Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Peking Union Medical College, believes that induced abortion is unscientific and cannot solve the problem of excessive population growth, because one can become pregnant again soon after an abortion, and such operations are extremely prone to accidents. She said, "Doctors, especially obstetricians and gynecologists, find it difficult to raise such opinions; if they do, people will say that doctors are ideologically conservative, unwilling to accept new things, and so on. But when accidents happen, doctors will be blamed for their poor surgical skills. This really puts doctors in a difficult position." She then added, "Even if the surgery is without problems, the current equipment conditions make it difficult to perform a large number of induced abortions. If we calculate based on 1% of the 160,000 pregnant women in Beijing each year requesting abortions, we would need 1,600 beds; even opening a specialized abortion hospital would not be enough." She said: If the Ministry of Health believes that induced abortion is a correct measure, then please let the leaders of the Ministry of Health explain to the doctors what the benefits of induced abortion are, and calculate the costs clearly. Only in this way will doctors dare to perform a large number of abortion operations. She emphasized: "The way to solve the problem of excessive population growth is to promote contraception, not induced abortion."

    Zhang Xiaoqian, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Peking Union Medical College, said that induced abortion is a surgery that can easily lead to fatalities. He asked, "Why didn't the Ministry of Health consult the medical community more before making this decision to relax restrictions on induced abortion?"

    Zhu Futang, President of Beijing Children's Hospital, also believes that induced abortion is not a method of preventing childbirth, cannot solve the problem of excessive population growth, and the percentage of accidents is quite high. Hu Jingfu, a researcher at the Academy of Medical Sciences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: "This decision is a manifestation of the leaders of the Ministry of Health not respecting and trusting the opinions of scientists."

### 许多医学家发表意见  不同意放宽人工流产的限制

    许多医学家发表意见
    不同意放宽人工流产的限制
    本报讯　在中国科学院第二次学部大会生物学部24日和25日的分组会议上，许多医学家对卫生部5月15日发出的关于放宽人工流产的限制的通知提出了意见。
    中国协和医学院妇产科主任林巧稚认为，人工流产是不科学的，人工流产也不能解决人口增加过多的问题，因为做了人工流产以后不久又可以怀孕，况且做这种手术极容易发生事故。她说：“这样的意见，医生们、特别是妇产科的医生们难于提出；提了，人们就会说医生们是思想保守，不接受新鲜事物，等等。可是当出了事故以后，医生们又会被责备手术水平不高。这真叫医生们为难。”接着她又说：“就算手术没有问题，目前的设备条件也难于大量做人工流产。以北京市每年十六万孕妇的1％要求做人工流产来计算，就需要一千六百个床位，即使专门开办一个人工流产医院也不够用。”她说：假若卫生部认为人工流产这一措施是正确的，那么请卫生部的领导人向医生们讲清人工流产的好处究竟在哪里，并且算清账。只有这样，医生们才敢于大量地进行人工流产的手术。她强调说：“解决人口增加过多问题的办法，是提倡避孕，而不是人工流产。”
    中国协和医学院内科学系主任张孝骞说，人工流产是一种很容易发生人命事故的手术。他问：“为什么卫生部在作出这个放宽人工流产的限制的决定以前，不多征求医学界的意见？”
    北京儿童医院院长诸福棠也认为，人工流产不是预防生育的方法，不能解决人口增加过多的问题，而且发生事故的百分率相当大。中国人民解放军医学科学院研究员胡经甫说：“这个决定是卫生部的领导人不尊重和不信任科学家的意见的表现。”
