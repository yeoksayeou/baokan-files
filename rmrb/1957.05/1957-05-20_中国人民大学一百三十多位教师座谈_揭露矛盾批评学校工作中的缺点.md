More Than 130 Teachers at Renmin University of China Hold Symposium
Exposing Contradictions and Criticizing Shortcomings in School Work

    This newspaper reports that on the afternoon of the 18th, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Renmin University of China invited more than 130 professors, associate professors, and lecturers to a symposium. At the meeting, Vice Presidents Nie Zhen and Zou Lufeng again asked everyone to offer criticisms of all aspects of the school's work and thoroughly expose the contradictions in the work.

    Shi Wanxian and Li Zhou, professors in the Physical Education Research Office, criticized the school for not paying enough attention to students' health. Professor Li Zhou said that Chairman Mao called on young people to be "three-good" (good in health, study, and work), but Renmin University is running a "three minus one" education. School leaders rarely inquire about the students' health.

Old Teachers Not Being Reused, Good Experience Not Being Absorbed

    Lecturer Xing Zongjiang said that after the old teachers who originally served as deans and department heads came to Renmin University, they were not given any leadership positions. This means that the good experience of the school in the past cannot be absorbed. The efficiency of the school's administrative affairs work is far inferior to that of other schools. After the issue of intellectuals was raised, many old teachers requested to join the Party. Although it cannot be said that the president ignored them, it can at least be said that they were given very little attention, which made people feel cold. It is possible that not a single old teacher in our school has joined the Party.

    Associate Professor Chen Yunming said that the relationship between leaders at all levels is not smooth. The president rarely asks the directors of the teaching and research offices to understand the situation. Some directors of teaching and research offices said that they have not spoken individually with the president for several years. The connection between the department heads and the directors of the teaching and research offices is also disconnected. The school does not consult with the masses on some major events. By the time the masses know about it, the leadership has already made a decision, and raising opinions is useless. At best, the leadership will explain it to you. Teachers do not understand the school's current central tasks and have no choice but to "ignore" school matters and "do whatever is given to them." They are not allowing the masses to establish a sense of responsibility as masters of the house, and of course, there is no way to give play to the wisdom of the masses. Because the leadership does not rely on the masses, problems that could have been solved have not been resolved for a long time, such as the problem of curriculum duplication, which has not been resolved for a long time. In this way, on the one hand, the teaching effect is not good, and on the other hand, it increases the ideological burden on the students. If the school leaders contacted the masses and relied on the teachers, the problem could be solved smoothly.

Teaching and Research Offices Should Undertake Less Administrative Affairs, Schools Should Respect People With Academic Achievements

    Associate Professor Zhao Li said that the newspaper said that Peking University is like a yamen (government office), but I think Renmin University is even worse. The teaching and research office is not an academic collective, but an administrative unit similar to a section. The teaching and research office undertakes as many administrative affairs as a department-level unit in other schools. A considerable number of teaching and research offices have one-third of their personnel holding administrative positions. Some directors of teaching and research offices have to spend half of their time doing administrative work. Above the teaching and research office are the department, the faculty, and the president. Below are the teaching groups. Teachers have direct contact with the teaching group leaders and rarely contact the directors of the teaching and research offices. It goes without saying that they have even less contact with the president and the faculty members. I attended the school's meeting on scientific research, etc. last time, and there were plans first, and everyone discussed them. Although the speeches at the meeting were very good, the conclusion of the meeting had already been prepared before the meeting. The result is that the resolutions become a mere formality. The school does not look at people from an academic point of view, but from an administrative position. When teachers become directors of teaching and research offices, everyone sees this as a promotion. I think the director of the teaching and research office does not necessarily have to be the best person academically, but should choose someone with the ability to handle affairs and organize. In the past, we had some teachers who had just shown some promise academically, and we let them be the directors of the teaching and research offices, which resulted in delays in their professional work. The school should respect people with academic achievements and absorb more of their opinions.

The Main Problem Currently Is to Cultivate Independent Thinking Among Teachers

    Associate Professor Lin Wanhe said: The school leadership says that the achievements of Renmin University in the past few years have been basic. I don't see it that way. I say that the current shortcomings are basic. The key to the failure, I think, is that we have treated running Renmin University as a task, not as a new China's education cause. Our guidelines have not been fixed. In terms of scientific research, we have not paid enough attention to regular research work. Our basic administrative system has not been established, and we cannot guarantee that everyone will put their main energy into scientific research. I think the work of the school Party committee has also basically failed. Many teachers cannot think independently, they only know how to obey. We say whatever the higher-ups say, and our ability to judge independently is very insufficient. Of course, it should also be affirmed that the Party has made great achievements in cultivating us in the past few years. I think the main problem we currently have is cultivating independent thinking among teachers.

    Lecturer Tang Shiru said: In the past seven or eight years, I have felt that our school leadership has had a few more and a few less. More self-assertion, less consultation; more orders, less inspection; more calls, less concrete help; more criticism, less praise. The leadership work is generally handled. The leadership only knows how to issue orders to various professional departments, regardless of the characteristics of each department. This is inseparable from the overlapping of institutions. The Academic Affairs Department and the Research Department do not know what positive role they play in teaching? They only played a formalistic role, and they only played the role of preventing the president from directly contacting the departments and teaching and research offices.

### 中国人民大学一百三十多位教师座谈  揭露矛盾批评学校工作中的缺点

    中国人民大学一百三十多位教师座谈
    揭露矛盾批评学校工作中的缺点
    本报讯　18日下午，中共中国人民大学委员会邀请一百三十多位教授、副教授、讲师举行座谈会。会上，副校长聂真、邹鲁风再次要求大家对学校各方面工作提出批评，彻底揭露工作中的矛盾。
    体育教研室教授时万咸、李洲批评学校不重视同学的健康。李洲教授说，毛主席号召青年“三好”，人民大学办的却是三缺一的教育。学校的领导人很少过问同学的身体。老教师未被重用好经验不能吸收
    邢宗江讲师说，老教师中原来担任院长、系主任的人来人大后，没有担任任何领导工作，这就不能吸收学校中过去好的经验。学校行政事务工作的效率远不及其它学校。知识分子问题提出后，许多老教师要求入党，虽不能说校长是置之不理，但起码可说是理的很少，使人感到冷淡，我校老教师可能一个也没有入党的。
    陈允明副教授说，各级领导者之间，关系不通畅，校长很少找教研室主任了解情况，有的教研室主任说，几年没有同校长个别谈过话，系主任同教研室主任联系也脱节，学校一些重大事件不和群众商量，等群众知道了以后，领导上已经决定了，再提意见也不起作用，至多是领导上向你解释解释。教员不了解学校当前的工作中心，只好对学校事情“不闻不问”，“给什么做什么”不让群众树立主人翁的责任感，当然也就谈不上发挥群众的智慧。由于领导不依靠群众，使得本来能够解决的问题一直得不到解决，例如课程重复问题，时间很久，还没有解决。这样一方面教学效果不好，另一方面也增加了同学们的思想负担，校领导如果和群众接触，依靠教员，问题是能得到顺利解决的。
    教研室要少担任行政事务学校应尊重学术上有成就的人
    赵澧副教授说，报上说北大像衙门，我看人大是有过之无不及，教研室不是个学术集体，而像科似的一个行政单位，教研室担任相当其它学校系一级所担任的那样多的行政事务，不少教研室有三分之一的人担任行政职务，有的教研室主任要拿出一半的时间去做行政工作，教研室上面有系、部、校长，下面有教学小组，教员直接和教学小组长发生关系，同教研室主任都很少接触，同校长、部长接触那更是不用说了。我参加上次学校召集的讨论学校科学研究等会议，都是先有方案，大家讨论，会上的发言虽然很好，但大会的结论早已是会前做好了的，结果是决议流于形式。学校不是从学术方面来看人，而是从行政职位来看人，教师当教研室主任，大家都看成这是提拔。我看教研室主任不一定非要学术上最好的人，而是要选有办事能力和组织能力的人去担任。我们过去有些教师，学术上刚显出一些起色，就让他做教研室主任，在业务上结果是耽误了。学校应当尊重学术上有成就的人，要多吸收他们的意见。
    当前主要问题是培养教师的独立思考
    林万和副教授说：学校领导上说几年来人民大学的成绩是基本的，我不是这样看法。我说目前缺点是基本的。失败的关键，我认为是我们把办人民大学当成一种任务，不是当成新中国的教育事业去办。我们的方针问题一直定不下来，在科学研究方面，对经常的研究工作注意不够。我们的基本行政制度，也未建立起来，还不能保证让大家把主要精力都放到科学研究上去。对校党委工作我认为基本上也是失败的。许多教师不会独立思考，只知道服从，上级说什么，我们说什么，独立判断能力非常不够。自然，还应该肯定，几年来党对我们的培养是有了很大成绩。我认为我们当前主要的问题是培养教师的独立思考。
    唐世儒讲师说：七八年来，我感到我校领导上有几多几少。自作主张多，商量少；命令多，检查少；号召多，具体帮助少；批评多，表扬少。领导工作一般化，对各专业系，不顾各系特点，只知发布命令，这与机构重叠是分不开的。教务部、研究部不知对教学起什么积极作用？只起了形式主义的作用，起了个校长不能直接同系、教研室接触的作用。
