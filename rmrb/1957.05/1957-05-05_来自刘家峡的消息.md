    News from Liujiaxia
    Footprints Left in Gorges and on Cliffs

    Spring has come to Liujiaxia. Surveying teams have spent three years in Liujiaxia. Their glorious footprints are left all over the nearly 300 square kilometers of the Liujiaxia construction area. In the turbulent gorges and on the precipitous cliffs, they have carried out extensive drilling, excavation, geological and surveying work. Now, a large number of surveying team members are concentrating their efforts on completing the second stage of the preliminary design survey work ahead of schedule—selecting the dam axis, dam type, and the structural form of the powerhouse and other hydraulic structures. News has it that the report is expected to be submitted in mid-July. After that, the surveying work for some of the technical design stage will begin.

    Red and white flags flutter on the mountain tops, and work sheds stand among the mountains. On the river, drilling rigs roar in response to the river's roar. The river drilling work is expected to be completed one month ahead of schedule during the dry season. In this way, the timber released from the Tao River to Lanzhou can pass through here smoothly.

    Protecting the Bingling Temple Grottoes

    The famous Bingling Temple Grottoes are located in the Liujiaxia Reservoir area, and the state has decided to take measures to protect them.

    This grotto, built during the Northern Wei Dynasty, is a treasure house of art. Bingling Temple means "Ten Thousand Buddhas" in Tibetan. This grotto, which is at least 1,400 years old, was recorded in ancient Chinese books as early as the 5th century. The famous Chinese scholar Zheng Zhenduo once researched that this place was historically a "transportation hub" and a "gathering place for merchants," and believed that "the Bingling Temple Grottoes will radiate even more brilliant light in the hands of the people."

    Since last year, geological surveyors have been conducting preliminary reconnaissance and surveying work here. Relevant parties believe that it is possible to prevent the grotto from being submerged or suffering other losses. The preliminary design is to build a river dam and two drainage tunnels here. This year, more detailed geological drilling work will be carried out here, including soil drilling, adits, and trench projects, and a 1:1,000 topographic map will be drawn. These projects will start one after another. Geologists and surveyors have set off.

    Geological Home

    The people surveying Liujiaxia have built their own happy home in the mountain gorges more than 1,600 meters above sea level.

    Hundreds and thousands of surveyors live on platforms, mountainsides, and gorge mouths. On the doors of simple houses are written "Geological Home" and "Dedicate Youth to Electrification." Comrades working in the reservoir area also live in farmers' homes. Comrades in the other seven work areas live in their own tents and simple houses. Nearly 6,000 square meters of simple housing have been built here. There are seven construction site canteens here. People can choose their favorite steamed buns, noodles, stir-fried dishes, and dumplings for each meal. Buying food is very convenient and does not require prior registration. People drink Yellow River water, and bitter water is only used for washing faces. The river water is drawn up the steep cliffs by pumps. On the banks of the Yellow River, fishing enthusiasts often laugh with their companions when a fish is caught.

    Movie nights and dances are often held on weekends and holidays. In terms of cultural learning, there are three classes: junior primary, senior primary, and junior high school. The construction site is the classroom, and more than 200 people participate in cultural learning. (Attached picture)

    来自刘家峡的消息
    足迹留在峡谷和悬崖上
    春天来到刘家峡。勘测队员在刘家峡已经度过了三个年头。刘家峡工区近三百平方公里的面积上，都留下了他们光荣的脚印。在水流湍急的峡谷里，在峭壁直挺的悬崖上，他们进行了巨大的钻探、开挖、地质和测量工作。现在，大批的勘测队员正集中力量争取提前完成初步设计第二阶段的勘测工作——选定坝轴线、坝型和厂房及其他水工建筑物的结构形式。有消息说，报告书可望在7月中旬交出。在那以后，部分技术设计阶段的勘测工作就要开始了。
    山头上飘扬着红白小旗，山间矗立一座座的工棚。在河上，一台台的钻机应着河水的咆哮发出巨响。河心钻探工作可望提前一月在枯水期内完成。这样，洮河流放到兰州的木材就可顺利地通过这里了。
    保护炳灵寺石窟
    著名的炳灵寺石窟，位于刘家峡水库区，国家决定设法保护。
    这座远在北魏年间建筑的石窟，是一座艺术宝库。炳灵寺，藏语是“十万佛”的意思。这座至少有一千四百多年历史的石窟，远在五世纪，我国古代的书籍里就有过许多关于它的记载。我国著名学者郑振铎曾考证这里在历史上曾是“交通要道”和“商贾集中”之地，并且认为“炳灵寺石窟，在人民的手中，将会放射出更辉煌的光芒”。
    从去年开始，地质勘测人员就在这里进行初步的踏勘和测量工作。有关方面认为，设法使这座石窟不被淹没或受到其他损失，是可能的。初步设计是在这里修一座顺河坝和两个排水洞。今年在这里还要进行比较细致的地质钻探工作，包括土钻、平洞、槽坑等项目，并测绘出千分之一的地形图。这些工程就要陆续开始。地质和测量人员都出发了。
    地质之家
    勘测刘家峡的人们，在拔海一千六百多公尺的山巅峡谷里，建立了自己的快乐家园。
    成百上千个勘测队员，分别居住在台地上、山腰上和峡口旁。朴素的房屋门上，写有“地质之家”和“青春献给电气化”的字样。在水库区活动的同志，还住在农民家里。其他七处工作地区的同志们都住在自己搭建的帐篷和简易房屋里。这里共兴建了简易房屋面积近六千平方公尺。这里设有七处工地食堂。人们每顿饭都可以选择自己喜爱的馒头、面条、炒菜和包子。买饭很方便，不需事先登记。人们吃的都是黄河水，苦水只是用来洗脸。河水是由抽水机引上陡崖的。在黄河岸边，钓鱼的爱好者不时向同伴发出笑声，鱼儿上钩了。
    周末和假日经常举行电影晚会和舞会。在文化学习方面，设有初小、高小和初中三班，工地就是课堂，参加文化学习的有二百多人。（附图片）
