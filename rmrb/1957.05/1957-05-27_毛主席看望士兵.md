    Chairman Mao Visits Soldiers
    Shi Licheng

    On April 3rd of this year, the weather was exceptionally fine. Magnolias, azaleas, camellias, and peach blossoms covered the hillsides. Birds chirped merrily in the green treetops.

    Stationed in the suburbs of Hangzhou, the soldiers, bathed in sunlight, returned from the training grounds, happily heading to the canteen for lunch.

    At that moment, two covered jeeps drove into the barracks. Which leader was here to inspect the work? Which comrades were here to visit? Captain Wang Baoshan ran forward to greet them. Before he even reached the vehicles, several leaders walked towards him.

    The leader walking in front was tall and robust, with a ruddy complexion, wearing a silver-gray uniform and black cloth shoes. Ah, wasn't that Chairman Mao? Wang Baoshan’s heart skipped a beat, and he felt a warmth spread through his body. He rubbed his eyes and looked again: it was indeed our beloved Chairman Mao, the Chairman Mao we thought of every moment!

    Wang Baoshan saluted Chairman Mao, wanting to report something, but his mouth and brain seemed to be out of his control. He opened his mouth but couldn’t utter a word.

    Chairman Mao grasped Wang Baoshan’s hand and said, "Are you the leader here?"

    "I am the political instructor here." Wang Baoshan raised his head to look at Chairman Mao’s kind face, and his somewhat flustered heart immediately calmed down.

    "The comrades are having a meal, is that right?"

    "Yes, they just started lunch." Wang Baoshan answered at attention.

    Chairman Mao asked him to lead the way to the canteen for a look.

    As Chairman Mao and Captain Wang Baoshan walked shoulder to shoulder across a stone slab bridge over a small stream, and through a small patch of green bamboo forest, Chairman Mao asked Wang Baoshan again:

    "What work are you mainly engaged in now?"

    "Mainly training. And also demobilization education."

    "Are the veterans willing to demobilize?"

    "The veterans are very attached to the army. When they first heard they were to demobilize, they were unwilling to leave. But after education, they are now happy to return to the countryside to participate in production."

    Chairman Mao nodded and said with a smile, "That's very good."

    Chairman Mao walked down a difficult stone slope and went into a soldier’s dormitory. He attentively looked at the soldiers’ beds and the quilts they were using. Just as Chairman Mao walked out of the soldiers’ dormitory, he ran into a new recruit, Chen Xiangjun, who had just come off duty. Chen Xiangjun looked up and saw that it was Chairman Mao. He wanted to quickly step aside to make way, but Chairman Mao had already warmly taken his hand:

      "Comrade, you've worked hard!"

    Chen Xiangjun just grinned at Chairman Mao, unable to say a word.

    "How old are you this year? Where are you from?"

    "I’m from Pingyang, Zhejiang, twenty-one years old this year."

    Chairman Mao said with a smile, "You look very strong!"

    The soldiers eating in the canteen, hearing "Chairman Mao is here!" happily surged to the canteen entrance. Some were holding half a bowl of rice, others still had chopsticks in their hands. Chairman Mao waved to the soldiers, who stared at Chairman Mao without blinking, their faces revealing an irrepressible inner joy. They felt that seeing Chairman Mao was the greatest happiness of their lives.

    Chairman Mao walked into the soldiers’ canteen, picked up a plate of vegetables from the table, looked at it, weighed it in his hand, and asked the soldier beside him:

    "Is there enough food at each meal?"

    The soldiers said in unison, "Yes, there’s enough!"

    "How much does the food cost per day? Is it 42 cents?"

    "It is 42 cents." Sergeant Yu Jinshan replied, thinking: Chairman Mao is busy with national affairs every day, yet he still knows how much our food costs each day, truly caring for us soldiers!

    Chairman Mao looked at the canteen’s equipment and the food and vegetables the soldiers were eating, then stood up and smiled, waving to the soldiers again:

    "Comrades, eat your meal, eat your meal."

    In such a happy moment, everyone was filled with excitement, who could still bother eating?

    Chairman Mao walked out of the canteen, and the soldiers, smiling, squeezed out of the canteen to see Chairman Mao off. Chairman Mao walked to a place not far from the kitchen door, and the cook, Gu Binfu, happened to run over to see Chairman Mao, meeting him face to face.

    Chairman Mao grasped Gu Binfu’s greasy hand and said very warmly:

      "Ah, Master Cook, you’ve worked hard!"

    Forty-six-year-old Gu Binfu had been a cook for thirty years. In the old society, Kuomintang officials saw him,嫌了他脏，嫌他笨，叫他闪的远远的，叫他滚到别处去。可是今天， he saw the great leader Chairman Mao, who shook his hand and called him "Master Cook". A current of warmth surged to his eyes, and he smiled through tears.

    It was past twelve o’clock. Chairman Mao shook hands with the soldiers to say goodbye, and the soldiers applauded to see him off. Chairman Mao walked away, but turned back and stood on the mountain road, waving to the soldiers.

    毛主席看望士兵
    史立成
    今年4月3日，天气格外的好。玉兰花、映山红、茶花和桃花开满了山坡。鸟儿在绿树枝头啾啾地叫。
    驻在杭州市郊的士兵们，披着阳光，从训练场回来，欢欢乐乐地到食堂去吃午饭。
    这时，两辆带篷小汽车开进了营房。是哪位首长来检查工作？是哪儿的同志来参观？王宝善上尉跑向前去迎接。还没到汽车跟前，几位首长向他走来了。
    走在前面的一位首长，身材魁梧，满面红光，身着银灰色制服，脚穿黑色布鞋。啊，这不是毛主席吗？王宝善心里猛地一跳，全身热烘烘的。他揉揉眼睛，再仔细一看：是亲爱的毛主席，是我们时时刻刻想念的毛主席！
    王宝善向毛主席敬了礼，想报告两句什么，可是嘴巴和脑子好像不听使唤了。他张了张嘴，却没有说出话来。
    毛主席握住王宝善的手，说：“你是这儿的首长吗？”
    “我是这儿的指导员。”王宝善仰起头望望毛主席慈祥的面容，有点慌的心马上镇静了。
    “同志们正在开饭，是吗？”
    “是，刚刚开午饭。”王宝善立正回答。
    毛主席请他领着到食堂去看看。
    毛主席和王宝善上尉并肩跨过一条小溪上的石板桥，穿过一小片青竹林的时候，毛主席又问王宝善：
    “现在正忙些什么工作？”
    “主要是搞训练。再就是复员教育工作。”
    “老兵愿意复员吗？”
    “老兵们很留恋部队，一听说叫复员，开始不愿意走；经过教育，现在都乐意回农村去参加生产了。”
    毛主席点点头，微笑着说：“这样很好。”
    毛主席顺石阶走下一段难走的石坡，到一间士兵宿舍里。他关切地看了士兵们的床铺，盖的被子。毛主席刚刚走出士兵宿舍，迎面碰见了刚下岗的新兵陈相均。陈相均抬头一看是毛主席，想很快地让开路；毛主席已经亲热地把他的手握住了：
      “小同志，辛苦啦！”
    陈相均光咧着嘴朝着毛主席笑，回答不出话来。
    “你今年多大啦？哪儿的人？”
    “浙江平阳人，今年二十一岁。”
    毛主席笑着说：“你长得很壮实啊！”
    正在食堂吃饭的士兵，听说“毛主席来啦！”高兴地涌到食堂门口。有的端着半碗饭，有的还拿着筷子。毛主席向士兵们招手，士兵们眼一眨不眨地望着毛主席，脸上露出抑止不住的内心的欢笑。他们觉得见到毛主席，是一生最大的幸福。
    毛主席走进士兵食堂，托起桌子上的一盘菜，看了看，掂了掂，问身旁的士兵：
    “每顿的菜够吃吗？”
    士兵们不约而同地说：“够吃了！”
    “每天的菜金多少钱？是四角二吗？”
    “是四角二。”余金山中士一面回答，一面想：毛主席每天忙国家大事，还知道我们每天菜金是多少，真关心我们士兵啊！
    毛主席看看食堂的设备和战士们吃的饭和菜，然后站起身，微笑着向士兵们又招招手说：
    “同志们吃饭，吃饭吧。”
    在这样幸福的时刻，人人怀着激动的心，谁还顾得上吃饭。
    毛主席走出食堂，士兵们欢笑着挤出食堂送毛主席。毛主席走到伙房门口不远的地方，正巧炊事员顾彬甫跑来看望毛主席，和毛主席碰个对面。
    毛主席握住顾彬甫油腻的手，非常亲热地说：
      “啊，大师傅，辛苦啦！”
    四十六岁的顾彬甫，做了整整三十年炊事活儿，在旧社会，国民党的官见了他，嫌他脏，嫌他笨，叫他闪的远远的，叫他滚到别处去。可是今天，他见到了伟大的领袖毛主席，毛主席和他握手，又称他“大师傅”。心里的一股热流涌到了眼上，他含着热泪笑了。
    十二点多了。毛主席和士兵们握手告别，士兵们鼓掌欢送毛主席。毛主席走远了，还回过身来站在山路上向士兵们招手。
