Unforgettable Friendship
Chen Quanbi

We are very grateful to the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for their invitation, which gave us, a group of Chinese journalists, the opportunity to visit our great ally, the Soviet Union, which we have long admired, for the first time. Although there have been many exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, with delegations of journalists and news workers, the Soviet Union, for those of us visiting for the first time, left an impression that was so fresh and so profound. We spent forty-two days as guests in the Soviet Union, flying nearly 16,000 kilometers over the great Soviet land. We visited Estonia and Latvia on the Baltic coast, the Soviet coal capital of Donbass, the heroic city of Stalingrad, the famous Soviet oil-producing region of Baku, and the famous summer resort of Sochi. From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, we had extensive contact with the Soviet people of all nationalities who are engaged in the great cause of communist construction. We met with workers, collective farmers, government staff, soldiers, and young students. We also met everywhere those Soviet people who had participated in our War of Resistance Against Japan and helped us liberate Northeast China, and who had participated in our socialist construction. Wherever we went, we were met with their kind concern and warm reception. Whether in practical contact or in simple conversations, we deeply understood the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards us. They sincerely sympathized with our past experiences and admired the arduous struggle we had made in the past. They hoped that we would make more rapid progress in all aspects and that our socialist construction would achieve greater success.

We will never forget the four days we spent as guests in Estonia. Although the climate in this coastal country was still snowy and rainy in early April, I found that the enthusiasm of the Estonian people for the Chinese people was hotter than the sweltering heat. Their journalists and cultural circles mobilized almost all the forces they could to receive us. This republic had only been visited by Chinese delegations twice, once by our delegation and once by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe led by Zhou Xinfang. They told us about the performances of the Peking Opera Troupe in Tallinn. In just a few days, nearly 200,000 people watched Chinese Peking Opera. However, Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has a total population of just over 270,000 people today. Comrade Shale Mingge, the editor-in-chief of the Estonian Party Central Committee's newspaper "People's Voice," accompanied us throughout. His kind and amiable face, sincere and earnest attitude as a comrade, and down-to-earth working style will never be forgotten by us in this lifetime. Comrade Shale Mingge often told us: "Estonia has suffered a lot in the past, and the Chinese people have also suffered a lot in the past. We have long been brothers in adversity, so we especially sympathize with the Chinese people and especially hope that China will be strong and achieve success in socialist construction."

In Estonia, Comrade Gabe, the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, received us in his busy schedule. Among the gifts he gave each of us was an Estonian flag. He said: "When you see the Estonian flag, may you always think of your Baltic friends in Estonia."

We will also never forget the half-day we spent as guests on the Guards warship in Tallinn Bay. Although the time was so short, we were immersed in warm friendship from beginning to end. This first warship, built in the Tsarist era sixty-four years ago, has its own glorious history in the era of the Soviet regime. During the Great Patriotic War, this warship was responsible for the defense of the Baltic Sea. It shot down six German fascist aircraft and sank twenty enemy warships. All the officers and soldiers on board also participated in the land defense of Leningrad. In April 1942, this mine-laying ship with a glorious history was awarded the honorary title of Guards. It was in the lower deck of this warship that we were welcomed by all the officers and soldiers of the ship. Although according to the custom of the Soviet Navy, no alcohol can be used to entertain guests in warships, the raging flames of Sino-Soviet friendship burned strongly in our hearts. So many people applauded until their hands ached, and so many people cheered for Sino-Soviet friendship until their voices were hoarse! They recounted the scene of the welcome given to the Soviet Pacific Fleet warships "Savvy" and "Enlightenment" by the people of Shanghai during their visit to China in June 1956. They clearly remembered the story of a young couple in Shanghai who named their twins born on the day of the warship's visit "Savvy" and "Enlightenment." They praised and missed the Chinese comrades who had interned on this warship. Comrade Glukhov, an old soldier on the ship, delivered a passionate and moving speech that touched the hearts of each of us. He said: "We hope that the Chinese Navy will grow quickly. We love peace, but if imperialism really provokes a war, the Chinese Navy will certainly be able to fight alongside the Soviet Navy. We congratulate the Chinese Navy on achieving greater success in combat training, and we extend our greetings to the Chinese people and the Chinese Navy." The interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union are always combined together. Having such a strong and reliable friend as the Soviet Union is the best guarantee for our cause.

On the afternoon of April 11, we visited the ancient and famous University of Tartu, about 180 kilometers from Tallinn, with a history of 150 years. Comrade Klimont, the President of the University, is a member of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party. His hair was completely white. This university has a group of students who automatically organized themselves to study Chinese. They had contacted the editorial department of the "People's Daily" a year earlier. They had written to us asking about methods of learning Chinese and raised difficult issues in learning Chinese that needed to be resolved. Interestingly, there is not a single Chinese teacher at this university. The only Estonian teacher learned Chinese from a native of Qingtian, Zhejiang, in Paris twenty or thirty years ago. Compared with our modern Chinese, it has completely changed. But these twenty-four young people who organized themselves with their own enthusiasm, their love for New China, and their spirit of hard work and fearlessness of difficulties, were already able to converse with me in Chinese that I could understand, asking about the process of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, the situation of socialist construction, and the lives of Chinese university students. Although I only stayed at the University of Tartu for an hour, they still asked me to give them Chinese names. They are all science students. They repeatedly stated that they hoped to learn Chinese well and come to China to help us with socialist construction. They hoped that we would send some simplified character tables, dictionaries, the Chinese flag, and portraits of Comrade Mao Zedong. When we shook hands and said goodbye, the tears of the young people could not help but burst out. I sincerely thank the Estonian youth for their deep love for New China.

If the weather on the Baltic coast in April was still chilly, then the climate in Azerbaijan, south of the Caucasus, was already summery with lush trees. We were deeply impressed by the beauty and grandeur of this republic bordering the Caspian Sea. Before the October Revolution, Azerbaijan was a desolate and barren region, but now it has been built into a happy paradise for the Azerbaijani people. Take Baku, the capital of this republic, as an example. There was once a story that Gorky had visited this city three times, twice before the revolution, when he tried to find a patch of green shade in the city, but found none. Baku left Gorky with the impression of a most terrible hell. Workers lived in mud houses, and the conditions were unimaginably bad. It was not until Gorky's third visit to Baku in 1927 that he greatly praised the city. He said that Baku's beauty could be compared to Milan, Italy. Now every district of Baku has its own patch of green shade. Large tracts of trees have covered the entire city.

During our visit to Azerbaijan, we especially felt the love of the Azerbaijani people for the Chinese people and their kind care for us. The moment we got off the plane, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan gave us a grand welcome. Almost all the ministers of the republic attended, and the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet warmly said to us: "China is our brother, our ideological friend and comrade. China is a great country, and the Chinese people are a great people. The enthusiasm and friendship of the Chinese people for the Soviet people can be fully demonstrated by the welcome given to Chairman Voroshilov by the Chinese people this time." Despite the Azerbaijani people's huge contributions and outstanding talents in building their own country, the Chairman still modestly praised the Chinese people. He said: "Azerbaijan has a proverb that a tree that bears many fruits always droops. A person who knows a lot is also more modest. We are very pleased with the Chinese people's wisdom and modesty."

At the song and dance evening held in Baku especially for our visit, we heard and saw the moving songs and dances of Azerbaijani artists. We found that the rhythm of their music and the melody of their songs were very similar to the songs and dances of our Xinjiang Uyghur people. Even the "Dombra" and hand drums they used were almost exactly the same as those of the Uyghur people. We can guess that many years ago there was always a pulse relationship between the Azerbaijani and Uyghur peoples in culture. When we heard the 75-year-old artist Polimov play a piece called "You Are Dressed So Beautifully" with a zither and the female singer Mikhalaliyeva sing "Smile" and "No, No," we felt as if we were sitting at home listening to the songs of our own brothers and sisters.

We will never forget our visit to the Kuba region of Azerbaijan, which is the most scenic area of Azerbaijan. The snow on the Kuba Mountains sparkled in the sunlight, and the sides of the flat asphalt road were full of blooming white apple blossoms. This is Azerbaijan's most famous white apple producing area. Comrade Voluchi, the First Secretary of the District Committee, and Comrade Popova, the Second Secretary, warmly came to greet us from dozens of kilometers away and accompanied us all day to visit the No. 12 State Horticultural Farm, the Communist Road Collective Farm, and the Orjonikidze Collective Farm, which have 2,000 hectares of orchards. At the luncheon held for us, the people of Kuba brought out their most precious wines and white apples to entertain us. We ate their specially made local Bekmans (a kind of cake made of rice flour, sugar, and cream) and listened to the enthusiastic words of each host. The Vice Chairman of the Azerbaijan Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, who accompanied us on our visit, told us a story on the spot. He said: "Many years ago, a group of very intelligent people lived in the Kuba region. They argued with each other about who was the happiest in the world. These intelligent people represented various schools of thought. Some said that the happiest people were those who were healthy. Obviously, these were people in the medical field. Some said that the happiest people were those who had mastered an art or could sing. Some said that the richest people were the happiest people. Finally, someone said that the happiest people were those with the most friends. So it can be said that the happiest people are the Soviet people, because they have so many people like the Chinese people as our friends. Yes, the Chinese people are also the happiest people, because they have the Soviet people and all peace-loving people in the world as their friends."

In the Soviet Union, we also visited various large-scale factories. We visited the Moscow Small Car Factory, the Putilov Factory in Leningrad, the Ganilt Tarajärve Oil Shale Processing Factory in Estonia, the Riga National Electrical Technology Factory, the Baku Oil Refinery, and the Moscow Film Studio. We visited the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station and the Volga-Don Canal. Often when we were amazed by the scale of the Soviet communist construction and its speed of development, all the heads of factories and enterprises—factory directors, managers, or chief engineers—would immediately tell you: "You will have it in the future, and you will have it soon." When visiting the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, the construction site director told me with confidence: "You will be able to build such a large hydroelectric power station in your second five-year plan." When we visited the Putilov Factory in Leningrad, Comrade Chindorov, the head of the factory's Party Committee Propaganda Department, told me: "China will certainly be able to manufacture its own large turbine engines soon." When we visited Minister of Culture Mikhailov and praised Soviet widescreen movies, he told us: "If China wants to establish widescreen movies, we are very happy to help." Even when we participated in the May Day Red Square parade and saw the latest Soviet jet planes flying overhead, the Soviet comrades next to us would tell you: "This plane is ours, and it is also yours. It belongs to all of us." Yes, with the selfless and brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union and the diligent efforts of the Chinese people, China's socialist industrialization will develop rapidly. We will be able to gradually build the factories we need and gradually produce the various products we need. We deeply thank the Soviet people for their sincere intentions towards the Chinese people.

In the Soviet Union, you can meet touching things everywhere. When you walk on the streets or in the park, you will meet enthusiastic Soviet people who put their commemorative badges on your chest. You will meet smiling Soviet people who come to shake hands with you warmly, praise the socialist construction of New China, and greet Mao Zedong and the Chinese people. Young Pioneers will take off their red scarves and put them around your neck, and little girls will quietly stuff a bouquet of flowers into your arms. Is there any other example that can be more vivid than this kind of extremely natural and extremely simple feeling between the Chinese and Soviet people?

On the afternoon of May 8, the day we were about to return to China, Comrade Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, received us in his busy schedule, which was a great honor for us in our lifetime. Although Comrade Khrushchev has been working hard for a long time to improve the Soviet economic management system, he looks very strong and full of energy. In a half-hour conversation, he talked about the improvement of the Soviet economic management system, the current international situation, and Sino-Soviet relations. Comrade Khrushchev cherished and cared so much about the development of friendship between China and the Soviet Union. He was very satisfied with the achievements we had made in this regard in the past few years. He said: "We Soviet people love the Chinese people. This friendship did not begin when the People's Republic of China was founded, but began during our revolutionary period. During the years when our people were engaged in revolutionary struggles, many Chinese comrades participated in the Red Guards and fought against the White Guards. The Chinese people have won. We regard the Chinese people as our dearest brothers, and the Chinese Communist Party as our dearest brother party. We are willing to do everything we can to help China. In terms of industry, we will do our best to help whatever China needs. This is our responsibility. Helping China is also helping ourselves. This will make the socialist camp even stronger." Comrade Khrushchev finally jokingly said that if the words I said about Sino-Soviet friendship still cannot satisfy your requirements, it is because I cannot find more appropriate words to describe our friendship. Comrade Khrushchev's assessment of Sino-Soviet friendship is actually a comprehensive summary of the Soviet people's deep friendship for the Chinese people that we have seen in the Soviet Union for more than a month.

Now, we have returned to our motherland for almost half a month. In the past month or so, our country has undergone tremendous changes, and we have thrown ourselves into the great rectification movement called for by our party. However, all the scenes in the Soviet Union and the brotherly friendship for more than a month still remain in my mind as clearly as yesterday. We will never forget the kind concern and warm reception of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union for us, and we will never forget the Soviet people's deep friendship for the Chinese people. We will definitely tell the Chinese people about the enthusiasm of the Soviet people. The Sino-Soviet friendship, which was firmly established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism in times of adversity, will only become more consolidated and more developed with the passage of time. May our motherland be more prosperous and stronger. Goodbye, all dear Soviet friends! May we advance together in our common cause!

    难忘的友情
    陈泉璧
    我们非常感谢苏联外交部新闻司和苏联对外文化协会对我们的邀请，使我们这批中国的新闻工作者能有机会第一次访问我们久已向往的我们伟大的盟邦苏联。虽然，中苏之间，新闻界人士和新闻工作者代表团的交往已不止一次，但苏联，对于我们这批初次访问的人来说，印象是那么新鲜和那么深刻。我们在苏联作客四十二天，在伟大的苏维埃国土上飞行将达一万六千公里，我们曾到过波罗的海沿岸的爱沙尼亚和拉脱维亚，到过苏联的煤都顿巴斯，也到过英雄的城市斯大林格勒，苏联著名的石油产地巴库和著名的夏季休养地索契。我们从波罗的海到黑海，从黑海到里海，我们与正在从事着伟大的共产主义建设的苏联各族人民有着广泛的接触。我们曾会见了工人、集体农民、政府工作人员、战士和青年学生。我们也到处遇到那些曾经参加过我国抗日战争和帮助我们解放东北的、曾经参加过我国社会主义建设的苏联人。我们所到之处，都受到他们亲切的关怀和热情的接待，无论在实际的接触中，简单的谈吐中，都使我们深刻地领会到苏联人民对我们的深厚的友情。他们真诚地同情我们过去的遭遇，钦佩我们过去所作的艰苦的斗争。他们希望我们在各方面更迅速地进步，希望我国的社会主义建设获得更大的成就。
    我们永远不能忘记在爱沙尼亚作客的四天。虽然这个近海的国家，4月初的气候还是时雪时雨，但我发现爱沙尼亚人民对中国人民的热情比盛暑还要酷热，他们的新闻界和文化界几乎动员了一切可以动员的力量来接待我们。这个共和国，中国代表团一共才到过两次，一次是我们这个代表团，一次是周信芳领导的上海京剧团。他们告诉我们这个京剧团在塔林演出的情景，几天之中，差不多有二十多万人看了中国的京戏。但是塔林，这个爱沙尼亚的首都，今天全部人口还不过二十七万多人。爱沙尼亚党中央机关报“人民之声报”总编辑沙烈明格同志始终陪同着我们，他那副和蔼可亲的面孔，诚诚恳恳的同志的态度，脚踏实地的工作作风，使我们在这一生中永远也不会忘记他。沙烈明格同志经常和我们讲：“爱沙尼亚过去受过很多苦难，中国人民过去也受过很多苦难，我们在患难中早已结成了兄弟，所以我们特别同情中国人民，特别希望中国强大和社会主义建设获得成就。”
    在爱沙尼亚，党中央的第一书记加贝同志曾在百忙中接见了我们，在他送给我们每人一份的礼品中，有一面是爱沙尼亚的国旗。他说：“愿你们在看到爱沙尼亚的国旗的时候，永远想到你们这个波罗的海海滨的朋友爱沙尼亚。”
    我们也永远不能忘记在塔林湾近卫军军舰上作客的那半天，虽然时间是那么短促，但自始至终我们都沉浸在热烈的友情中。这艘已有六十四年舰龄的沙皇时代建造的第一艘军舰，在苏维埃政权的年代中有它自己光荣的历史。在卫国战争时期，这艘军舰担负了波罗的海的防卫，它曾打下了六架德国法西斯飞机，打沉二十艘敌人的军舰。舰上的全体官兵还参加了列宁格勒的陆上保卫战。1942年4月，这艘具有光荣历史的布雷舰获得了光荣的近卫军的称号。就在这艘军舰的底层，我们受到了这艘军舰全体官兵的欢迎。虽然按照苏联海军的习惯，在军舰中不能用酒招待，但中苏友谊的烈焰，却强烈地燃烧着我们的心胸。多少人为我们的来到鼓掌得两手发痛，多少人为中苏的友谊欢呼得嗓音嘶哑！他们述说着1956年6月苏联太平洋舰队“智谋”与“启蒙”两艘军舰访问我国受到上海人民欢迎的情景，他们清楚地记得上海的一对青年夫妇，为军舰访问那天所生的双胞胎取名为“智谋”与“启蒙”的故事。他们称誉和怀念曾经在这艘军舰上实习过的中国同志。舰上老战士格鲁霍夫同志那一篇激昂动人的演说，打动着我们每一个人的心弦。他说：“我们希望中国的海军很快的成长，我们热爱和平，但帝国主义真要挑起战争，中国的海军一定能和苏联的海军并肩作战。我们祝贺中国海军在战斗训练中获得更大的成就，我们向中国人民和中国海军问候。”中苏两国人民的利益是始终结合在一起的，我们有苏联这样强大可靠的朋友，就是我们事业的最好的保证。
    4月11日下午，我们访问了离塔林约有一百八十公里、具有一百五十年历史的古老而著名的塔尔都大学，大学的校长克里蒙特同志是爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员。他的头发已经全白了。这所大学有一批自动组织起来学习中文的学生，早在一年以前就和“人民日报”编辑部有过联系，他们曾写信问过我们学习中文的方法，提出了在学习中文中的困难问题要求解决。有趣的是这个大学并无一个中国教员，仅有的一个爱沙尼亚教员，也还是二三十年以前在巴黎向浙江青田人学的中文，听起来和我们现代的中国话比起来，已完全走了样。但是这二十四个自动组织起来的青年，他们凭着自己的热情，凭着对于新中国的热爱，凭着自己刻苦学习、不怕困难的精神，在两年半的期间中，已经能够用我听得懂的中文和我交谈，问我们中国革命斗争的经过，社会主义建设的情况，中国大学生生活的情况。虽然我在塔尔都大学仅有一小时的停留，但他们还是要求我为他们取个中国名字。他们都是学理科的，他们再三表示，希望把中文学好后，一定到中国来帮助我们进行社会主义建设。他们希望我们寄一些简体字表、字典、中国国旗和毛泽东同志的像去。当我们握手告别时，青年人的热泪都情不自禁的夺眶而出。我衷心感谢爱沙尼亚青年对新中国的深深的热爱。
    假使说在波罗的海沿岸4月的天气还是春寒陡峭的话，那么高加索以南的阿塞拜疆的气候已经是夏意浓重、绿树成荫了。这个依临着里海的共和国，我们深深地为它的美丽和壮观而倾倒。阿塞拜疆在十月革命以前是一片荒凉贫瘠的地区，但现在已建成为阿塞拜疆人民幸福的乐园。就以这个共和国的首都巴库来说，曾经有这样一个故事，说高尔基曾经三次来过这个城市，两次是在革命以前，那时他试图在这个城市中找一块绿荫，但结果一点都没有找到。巴库当时留给高尔基的印象是一个最可怕的地狱，工人住在泥房子中，条件之坏不可想像。直到高尔基在1927年第三次到巴库时，他才大大赞赏了这个城市。他说巴库的美丽可与意大利的米兰相比。现在巴库每个区都已有自己的一块绿荫。成片的树木已把整个城市遮掩起来了。
    我们在阿塞拜疆作客的时候，特别感到阿塞拜疆人民对中国人民的热爱和对我们亲切的照顾。我们刚下飞机的顷刻，阿塞拜疆最高苏维埃主席团就对我们作了隆重的欢迎，共和国的部长同志几乎全部都出席了，最高苏维埃主席同志热情地对我们说：“中国是我们的兄弟，是我们思想上的朋友与同志，中国是一个伟大的国家，中国人民是伟大的人民，中国人民对苏联人民的热情和友谊，完全可以从这次中国人民欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席得到证明。”尽管阿塞拜疆人民在建设自己祖国的业绩中有着巨大的贡献和卓越的天才，但是主席同志还是那样谦逊地不断地赞扬中国人民。他说：“阿塞拜疆有这样一个谚语，一棵树果实结得很多，它永远是下垂的。一个人如果懂得多的话，也是更加谦虚的，我们为中国人民的英明谦虚而感到很大高兴。”
    在巴库专为我们的来到举行的歌舞晚会上，我们听到和看到了阿塞拜疆艺术家们的动人的歌唱与舞蹈。我们发现他们音乐的节奏与歌唱的旋律和我们新疆维吾尔族的歌唱与舞蹈颇多类似，甚至他们所使用的“东不拉”与手鼓也和维吾尔族的几乎完全一样。我们可以猜想到多少年以前阿塞拜疆人民与维吾尔族人民在文化上总有一种脉膊的关系。我们听到七十五岁的老艺人泼利莫夫用古琴演奏一曲“你打扮得真漂亮”和女歌唱家密哈拉里也娃唱“笑”和“不能，不能”的时候，我们完全好像坐在我们自己的家里听我们自己的兄弟民族的歌唱一样。
    我们将永远难忘在阿塞拜疆谷巴区的访问，那里是阿塞拜疆风景最为优美的地区，谷巴山的积雪在阳光下闪着银光，平坦的柏油路两侧尽是盛开着的白色的苹果花，这里是阿塞拜疆最著名的白苹果产地。区委第一书记渥路契同志、第二书记波波也娃同志那样热情地从几十公里以外来迎接我们，并整天陪同我们参观了拥有二千公顷土地果园的十二号国营园艺农庄、共产主义之路集体农庄和奥尔忠尼启则集体农庄。在为我们举行的午宴上，谷巴人民拿出了他们最名贵的葡萄酒、白苹果来招待我们。我们吃着他们特为我们精制的当地的土产贝克曼（一种用米面、糖和奶油做成的饼子），听着一个个主人所讲的热情的话。陪我们去访问的阿塞拜疆对外文协副主席即席和我们讲一个故事，他说：“多少年以前，谷巴区住着一群很聪明的人，他们互相争论世界上谁最幸福，这些聪明人代表各种学派。有人说最幸福的人是身体健康的人，显然这是医学界人士；有人说最幸福的人是掌握一门艺术或者能唱歌的人；有人说最富有的人是最幸福的人；最后有人说，最幸福的人是朋友最多的人。这样就可以说最幸福的人是苏联人，因为他有中国人民这样多的人作我们的朋友。是的，中国人民也是最幸福的人民，因为他有苏联人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民作我们的朋友。
    在苏联，我们也参观过各种规模巨大的工厂。我们曾访问过莫斯科小型汽车厂、列宁格勒的普梯洛夫工厂、爱沙尼亚的干里特拉雅尔费油母岩加工工厂、里加的国家电力技术工厂、巴库炼油厂、莫斯科电影制片厂。参观过斯大林格勒水电站的建设和伏尔加河—顿河运河。常常当我们为苏联共产主义建设的规模和它的发展速度而惊叹不已时，所有工厂企业的负责人——厂长、经理或者总工程师都会紧接着向你说：“你们将来一定会有，而且很快会有。”在斯大林格勒水电站参观时，工地主任那样有信心地告诉我说：“你们第二个五年计划就能建筑这样大的水电站。”我们访问列宁格勒普梯洛夫工厂时，工厂党委宣传部长清得洛夫同志告诉我：“中国将来一定能够很快制造自己的大型透平机。”我们在访问文化部长米哈伊洛夫同志并称赞苏联的宽银幕电影时，他告诉我们：“假使中国愿意建立宽银幕电影，我们是非常乐意帮助。”甚至我们参加五一节红场观礼看见苏联最新式的喷气机掠空而过时，旁边的苏联同志也告诉你：“这飞机是我们的，也是你们的，是我们大家的。”是的，在苏联无私的兄弟般的援助下，在中国人民勤劳的努力下，中国的社会主义工业化将有一日千里的发展，我们将能逐步建设起我们自己所需要的工厂，逐步生产出我们自己所需要的各种产品。我们深深地感谢苏联人民对中国人民一片赤忱的心意。
    在苏联，你到处可以遇到一些感动人心的事，当你漫步在街头或公园，你会遇到一些热情的苏联人把自己的纪念章佩带在你胸前；会遇到一些笑容满面的苏联人来和你热烈握手，赞美新中国的社会主义建设，并问候毛泽东和中国人民。少先队员们会把红领巾解下来围在你的脖子上，小姑娘会把一束鲜花悄悄地塞到你的怀里。中苏人民间的这种极其自然、极其纯朴的感情，难道还有其他的例子比这还更生动吗？
      5月8日，在我们将要回国的那天下午，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在百忙中接见了我们，这是我们一生中莫大的荣幸。虽然赫鲁晓夫同志好久以来就为改进苏联的经济管理制度费尽各种心机，但看起来身体却十分强壮，精神非常焕发。在一个半小时的谈话中，他从苏联的经济管理制度的改进谈到当前的国际形势，谈到中苏关系。赫鲁晓夫同志那样珍视和那样关怀着中苏两国友谊的发展，他非常满意过去几年来我们在这方面已经获得的成绩。他说：“我们苏联人民热爱中国人民，这种友谊不是从中华人民共和国成立的时候才开始的，而是从我国革命时期就开始了。在我国人民进行革命斗争的岁月里，曾有许多中国同志参加了赤卫队，向白卫军作战。中国人民胜利了，我们把中国人民看做最亲爱的兄弟，把中国共产党看成最亲爱的兄弟党。我们愿意尽一切努力帮助中国。在工业方面，凡是中国所需要的我们一定尽力帮助，这是我们的责任，我们帮助中国，也是帮助我们自己，这将使社会主义阵营更加有力量。”赫鲁晓夫同志最后诙谐地说，我讲的中苏友谊的话，如果还不能满足你们要求的话，那是因为我找不到更适当的言语来形容我们的友谊。赫鲁晓夫同志对中苏友谊的估计，实际上就是我们一个多月来在苏联实地看到的苏联人民对中国人民深厚友谊的一次全面性的总结。
    现在，我们已回到自己的祖国快半个月了。一个多月来，我们的国家已有了巨大的变化，我们已投入了我们党所号召的伟大的整风运动中。但是，一个多月来在苏联的一切情景，兄弟般的情谊，还像是昨天一样那样清晰地留在我的脑海中，我们永远不会忘记苏联各族人民对我们亲切的关怀和热情的接待，永远不会忘记苏联人民对中国人民那样深厚的友谊。我们一定把苏联人民的热情告诉给中国人民。在患难中，在马克思列宁主义基础上牢固地建立起来的中苏友谊，只会随着日月的消逝而更加巩固和更加发展。愿我们的祖国更加繁荣更加富强。一切亲爱的苏联朋友，再见！愿我们在共同的事业中共同前进！
