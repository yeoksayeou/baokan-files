Interpreting Ancient Steles Today	Yu Baile

History cannot be replayed. However, if modern people do not pay attention to learning from the experiences and lessons of historical events, they may inevitably repeat the mistakes of the ancients. Or, because of a lack of comparison, it becomes difficult to understand the laws of development and the trajectory of progress.

Recently, I saw two steles from the old Pear Garden Guild in Suzhou, and I was deeply moved. After reading these two ancient steles, I felt even more strongly that the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy we are currently adopting has tremendous historical significance.

In 1798 AD, i.e., the third year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese folk drama, after undergoing a huge development, caused serious unease among the feudal government of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Qing Emperor Yongyan issued an edict prohibiting the performance of "luantan," "bangzi," "Qin腔 [Qínqiāng]," and other dramas. This ban included the capital city and areas such as Jiangsu and Anhui. The two steles preserved by the old Pear Garden Guild in Suzhou record the details of this event. On the stele erected on the fourth day of the third month of the third year of Jiaqing, the notice of the Jiangning Governor was engraved. It reads:

“According to the imperial edict: The scripts circulating since the Yuan and Ming dynasties are all Kun弋 [Kūnyì] tunes, which are no longer the correct sounds of ancient music, but their rhythm and tunes still retain the meaning of the five tones; even the stories they portray still talk about loyalty and filial piety, which are still enough to inspire and admonish. However, recently, there have been 'luantan,' 'bangzi,' 'string music,' 'Qin腔 [Qínqiāng]' and other operas, whose sounds are lewd, and whose portrayals are either narrow and obscene or bizarre and rebellious, which have a great impact on customs and people's hearts. Although these tunes originated in Qin and Anhui, they have spread from place to place, and people are competing to imitate them. Even Suzhou and Yangzhou, which have always been accustomed to Kun腔 [Kūnqiāng], are now tired of the old and fond of the new, and regard 'luantan' and other tunes as novel and pleasing, and abandon the Kun腔 [Kūnqiāng] they are used to. This trend is deteriorating and must be strictly prohibited. In the future, except for Kun弋 [Kūnyì] tunes, which are still allowed to be performed as before, 'luantan,' 'bangzi,' 'string music,' 'Qin腔 [Qínqiāng]' and other operas are not allowed to be performed again. As for the capital city, let Heshen strictly investigate and prohibit them; and Jiangsu and Anhui governors, the Suzhou Weaving Department, and the Lianghuai Salt Administration are ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit them. If anyone still performs them as before, only the governor, salt commissioner, and weaving department will be held accountable. This is the imperial order.”

The above is a quote from the original imperial edict. Then, this governor stipulated many vicious methods, which are:

“They should first order the people to abandon them completely and not perform them again, so that these opera troupes will have no skills to use, so as not to spread from place to place and compete to imitate them. In addition to instructing the departments to investigate and prohibit them, if they are foreign troupes, they should be ordered to return to their hometowns as soon as possible and not allowed to stay in the territory; if they are troupes from this province, if they can change to Kun弋 [Kūnyì] tunes, they will still be allowed to perform. Therefore, a notice is hereby issued to inform all the military and civilians of the prefecture and all the opera houses: In the future, the people are only allowed to perform Kun弋 [Kūnyì] tunes in operas. Those who perform 'luantan' and other operas will be punished according to the law of violating the system, and no leniency will be granted. Everyone should abide by this order.”

This stele was jointly erected by nineteen opera troupes in the entire prefecture at that time. However, despite the strict prohibitions at the time, these folk dramas did not stop being performed. Therefore, more than two months later, on the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month of the third year of Jiaqing, the newly appointed Suzhou Weaving Department official issued another notice. It more severely declared:

“It has been found that Suzhou Prefecture has always only had Kun弋 [Kūnyì] tunes, and the stories they portray are all about loyalty and filial piety, which are enough to inspire and admonish. The 'luantan' and other operas are all foreign troupes, and the performances are obscene and bizarre, which are most harmful to customs and people's hearts. This official was ordered to take office, and from the beginning, I am afraid that there will be hypocrisy and malfeasance. Therefore, a notice is hereby issued again to prohibit them. If there are foreign 'luantan' and other troupes secretly residing in the prefecture city, and officials, gentry, scholars, and merchants who violate the prohibition and perform them, in addition to secretly investigating and handling them, the local officials will be instructed to strictly investigate and arrest them. Once exposed, the head of the troupe will be punished according to the example of violating the system, and the remaining actors will be punished with shackles and sent back to their original hometowns for custody, and will not be easily let go. The Kun腔 [Kūnqiāng] troupes in this place have always practiced new operas every year. In the future, they must also choose stories from historical facts that are loyal, filial, virtuous, and righteous, enough to persuade people to do good and punish evil, before they are allowed to be performed, and must not involve obscenity. Before the performance, the manuscripts of each legend should be submitted for approval. If any obscene and bizarre new dramas are privately performed, they will be severely punished once discovered. This official's words will be followed by the law, and no leniency will be granted.”

The end of this stele is engraved with the names of more than seventy troupe leaders in the entire prefecture at that time. It can be seen that the previous prohibition was not effective, so this prohibition specifically targeted the troupe leaders in order to investigate and handle them. However, these prohibitions of the feudal government of the Qing Dynasty failed to eliminate folk dramas such as "luantan," "bangzi," and "Qin腔 [Qínqiāng]"; instead, these folk dramas were tempered to be more vital and loved by the people in an oppressed environment.

The feudal rulers certainly did not understand the objective laws of the development of folk drama art, and thought that they could stifle them with tyrannical prohibitions. Historical facts have given the greatest mockery to feudal prohibitions. All folk drama arts, like other superstructures of society, change with the changes in the social foundation. To this day, whether it is "luantan," "bangzi," "string music," "Qin腔 [Qínqiāng]," or Kunqu Opera, Yiyang腔 [Yìyángqiāng], etc., have all released new artistic flowers.

However, not every worker in our country clearly understands the laws of the development of folk drama art and other superstructures. Although no one is advocating banning any kind of opera now, and even some operas that were banned in the past have now been opened up, some cadres are still uneasy about the full opening of folk operas and repertoires. They are afraid that all kinds of demons and monsters will appear and have a bad influence on the audience. This shows that these comrades still do not believe that the masses have the ability to discern and criticize, and do not understand that drama art, as one of the social ideologies, has its own special laws of development. I have seen some cadres who once firmly advocated banning certain repertoires, and even some comrades had various taboos about good operas recognized by the public. For example, the "Killing in the Temple" scene in the Qin Xianglian play and the "Ascension to Heaven" scene at the end of the Heavenly Match play were deleted during a certain broadcast, saying that the former did not conform to the spirit of unity, and the latter had too heavy a tragic atmosphere. This is simply baffling.

I hope that similar phenomena will never happen again in the future, and that this phenomenon will forever become a historical relic. At the same time, I hope that the steles from the early Jiaqing years mentioned above will be quickly collected into the exhibition hall of the historical museum, for people to use as historical criticism materials.

    古碑今解	于百了
    历史是不可能重演的。但是，现代人对于历史上的许多事情，如果不注意去吸取它们的经验教训，有时却不免要重蹈古人的复辙；或者对于许多事情因为缺乏比较，也就很难了解它们的发展规律和进步的轨迹。
    最近，我看到了苏州旧日梨园公所的两块碑刻，大有所感。读了这两块古碑，我更加觉得我们现在所采取的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是具有巨大历史意义的。
    公元1798年，即清朝嘉庆三年，我国民间戏剧，在经过了一个巨大的发展之后，引起了清朝封建政府的严重不安。当时清朝的皇帝颙琰下了一道谕旨，禁止乱弹、梆子、秦腔等戏剧的演唱。这个禁令包括京城地方以及江苏、安徽等地。苏州旧日梨园公所保存的两块碑刻，详细地记载了这件事情的始末。在嘉庆三年三月初四日立的那块碑上，刻了当时江宁巡抚的告示，它写道：
    照得钦奉谕旨：元明以来流传剧本，皆系昆弋两腔，已非古乐正音，但其节奏腔调，犹有五音遗意；即扮演故事，亦有谈忠说孝，尚足以观感劝惩。乃近日倡有乱弹、梆子、弦索、秦腔等戏，声音既属淫靡，其所扮演者，非狭邪媟亵，即怪诞悖乱之事，于风俗人心殊有关系。此等腔调，虽起自秦皖，而各处辗转流传，竞相仿效，即苏州、扬州向习昆腔，近有厌旧喜新，皆以乱弹等腔为新奇可喜，转将素习昆腔抛弃，流风日下，不可不严行禁止。嗣后除昆弋两腔仍照旧准其演唱外，其乱弹、梆子、弦索、秦腔等戏，概不准再行唱演。所有京城地方，着交和珅严查饬禁；并着传谕江苏、安徽巡抚，苏州织造，两淮盐政，一体严行查禁。如再有仍前唱演者，惟该巡抚、盐政、织造是问，钦此。”
    这一段引的是皇帝的谕旨原文，然后这位巡抚大人就规定了许多毒辣的办法，这就是：
    “即应先令民间概行摈弃，不复演唱，则此种戏班无技可施，庶不致辗转流传，竞相仿效。除行司转饬查禁，如系外来之班，谕令作速回籍，母许在境逗留；其原系本省之班，如能改习昆弋两腔，仍准演唱外，合亟出示晓谕阖属军民人等及各戏馆知悉：嗣后民间演唱戏剧，止许扮演昆弋两腔，其有演乱弹等戏者，定将演戏之家及在班人等均照违制律一体治罪，断不宽贷，各宜凛遵母违。”
    这块碑是当时全郡梨园十九个班会共同建立的。但是，尽管当时的禁令森严，这些民间戏剧仍然没有停止演唱。因此，两个多月以后，即嘉庆三年五月二十五日，新任的苏州织造部堂又出了一个告示。它更严厉地宣称：
     “查向来苏郡止有昆弋两腔，其扮演故事亦皆谈忠说孝，足以观感劝惩，其乱弹等戏俱系外来之班，所演淫亵怪诞，最为风俗人心之害。本部堂钦承简命，莅任伊始，恐有阳奉阴违情弊，合再通行示禁。如有外来乱弹等班潜住郡城，及官、绅、士、商违禁唱演等事，除密访查办外，并转行地方官严密查拿。一经败露，即将起班头人照违制例定罪，其余在班脚色各予枷责，仍行递解原籍收管，断不轻纵。其本处昆腔诸班，向例每年演习新戏，嗣后亦必按照史传实事，择其中忠孝节义，足以劝善惩恶者，方准扮演，母得稍涉淫靡；仍于开演之前，将各传奇缮本呈送，以凭去取。如有将淫亵怪诞新剧私演，一经查出，定当严办。本部堂言出法随，断不姑贷。”
    这一块碑的末尾刻了当时全郡梨园七十多个起班头人的姓名。可见前一个禁令没有生效，所以这一个禁令要特别抓住起班头人，以便查办。然而，清朝封建政府的这些禁令，并没有能够消灭乱弹、梆子、秦腔等民间戏剧；反而使这些民间戏剧在被压迫的环境下锻炼得更加富有生命力，更加为人民群众所爱护。
    封建的统治者当然不会懂得民间戏剧艺术发展的客观规律，而以为用暴虐的禁令就可以扼杀它们。历史的事实已经给了封建的禁令以最大的嘲笑。所有的民间戏剧艺术同社会的其他上层建筑一样，随着社会基础的变革而变革。直到今天，无论是乱弹、梆子、弦索、秦腔，或者是昆曲、弋阳腔等等，都放出了新的艺术之花。
    可是，对于民间的戏剧艺术和其他上层建筑发展的规律，在今天，还不是我们国家的每一个工作人员都认识清楚的。虽然现在谁也没有主张禁止任何一个剧种，而且就是过去曾被禁止的一些剧目现在也都开放了，但是，仍然有些干部对于民间的剧种和剧目的全部开放表示放心不下。他们害怕牛鬼蛇神一齐出现，给观众恶劣的影响。这说明这些同志还不相信群众有鉴别和批判的能力，还不了解作为社会意识形态之一的戏剧艺术有它的特殊发展规律。我见过有些干部曾经坚决主张禁演某些剧目，甚至有的同志曾经对于公认的好戏也有各种禁忌。比如，秦香莲剧中的杀庙一场、天仙配末尾的上天一场，在某次广播的时候就被删去，说是因为前者不合团结的精神，后者悲剧气氛太重。这简直叫人莫名其妙。
    我希望从今以后再不发生类似的现象，而让这种现象永远成为历史的陈迹。同时，我希望上面所举的嘉庆初年的碑刻，赶快被收进历史博物馆的陈列室中去，供人们作为历史批判的资料。
