Editor's Note: The rational revision of construction plans by thirteen state-owned machine manufacturing plants in the Shaanxi area and the re-examination and revision of design blueprints for new and rebuilt enterprises by the design personnel of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have both saved the state a significant amount of investment and ensured that these factories can be built faster and better. These two events once again illustrate that as long as we earnestly follow the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, we can achieve good construction at a lower cost and in a shorter time. The theme of this rectification campaign is to correctly handle contradictions among the people. In fact, many major contradictions among the people are often concentrated in the country's economic construction. On the one hand, we need to rapidly develop industry; on the other hand, we are a poor country with limited funds, leading to many new contradictions in the lives of the state and the people. To resolve these contradictions, we must build the country diligently and thriftily. However, not all cadres in many industrial departments, regions, and enterprises understand this principle. Therefore, in this rectification movement, a serious examination of the implementation of the "building the country diligently and thriftily" policy is of great significance for correctly handling contradictions among the people, for formulating the Second Five-Year Plan, and for promoting a spirit of hard struggle.

    Shaanxi's Thirteen Factories Revise Construction Plans
    Saving Over 240 Million Yuan in Construction Funds
    
    Xi'an Dispatch, May 7th: Recently, relevant departments inspected and summarized the construction work of thirteen state-owned machine manufacturing plants built in the Shaanxi area during the First Five-Year Plan and rationally revised the construction plans, saving the state over 240 million yuan in basic construction investment.
    The original design standards of these factories were generally too high, seeking perfection in everything. Now, based on the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, they have formulated cost-saving measures. One of the measures is to strengthen coordination and cooperation between factories. The factory sites of these plants are generally relatively close to each other, some separated only by a road. However, each factory was originally designed with machine repair workshops, carpentry workshops, foundry and forging workshops, oxygen stations, and fire truck garages. This wasted a large amount of construction funds, and in the future, after production begins, it will inevitably lead to low equipment utilization rates and large personnel establishments. According to calculations by relevant departments, if each factory builds a machine repair workshop according to the original design, the utilization rate of large equipment in each factory's machine repair workshop will be very low, some only reaching about 4%, and these large pieces of equipment are all ones that our country cannot produce. For example, if two factories very close to each other each build a fire truck garage, and then each has to equip a set of fire-fighting equipment and personnel, it is also completely unnecessary. Therefore, relevant departments have decided to follow the principle of coordination and cooperation, with some two factories sharing a carpentry workshop or machine repair workshop, and some three or four factories sharing an auxiliary workshop. Auxiliary workshops that have already been built but are no longer needed after cooperation will be converted for use as other workshops, and machinery and equipment will be transferred to other places where they are needed. Three factories in the suburbs of Xi'an sharing a carpentry workshop saves over 7,000 square meters of building area and more than 1.83 million yuan in investment. Some new factories are also striving to cooperate with local factories. For example, factories that originally planned to build oxygen stations have decided to ask local oxygen plants to supply oxygen; factories that originally planned to build fire truck garages are also striving to share one with nearby local state-owned factories.
    The design quotas for these new factories are generally very low, so there seems to be too much of various machinery and equipment and manpower. For example, two newly built machine manufacturing plants in the Xi'an area, shortly after starting production and while workers' skills are not yet very proficient, have already reached the designed production capacity. In the future, if they fully exploit the potential of the equipment, they will exceed the original design capacity by one to two times. In order to fully exploit the production potential of these factories, relevant departments have decided to stop building two similar factories that were planned to be built in the Second Five-Year Plan, so as to use the state's limited construction funds in more needed places. For example, in the Shaanxi area, there is a machinery factory that has been under construction for more than a year, and the welfare area, dormitories, and some small factory buildings have already been built. Now the state has decided to stop building this factory and place its planned production tasks in similar factories that have already started production. Its buildings and factory site will be given to a factory that urgently needs construction. This utilizes the original buildings and can also speed up the construction progress of another new factory.
    The architectural design standards of these factories are also too high, such as foundations being too deep and walls and cold-proof layers being too thick. According to the climate conditions in the Xi'an area, a cold-proof layer of six to eight centimeters is sufficient, but the cold-proof layer of some factories is as thick as sixteen to twenty centimeters. Therefore, relevant departments have decided to appropriately lower the construction standards. In addition, some unnecessary machinery and equipment have also been reduced. For example, some factories have automatic cranes in every workshop, but the cranes in some workshops are only used once a year. Removing these automated devices will not affect production at all.
    Relevant departments have also decided to appropriately reduce the construction scale of these factories or carry out construction in phases, so as to have more time to train and exercise technical forces and improve management levels.

### 陕西十三个工厂修改建厂方案  节约两亿四千多万元建设资金

专栏：

    编者按　陕西地区十三个国营机器制造厂合理修改了建厂方案，冶金工业部设计人员重新审查和修改了新建和改建企业的设计图纸，都给国家节省了大量投资，并且能保证这些工厂建设得更快更好。这两件事情再次说明：只要认真按照勤俭建国的方针办事，是能够花更小的代价，用更短的时间，搞好建设的。这次整风的主题是正确处理人民内部矛盾，事实上，人民内部很多主要矛盾，常常集中表现在国家的经济建设上。一方面，我们需要迅速地发展工业，另一方面，我们又是一个穷国，资金有限，以致在国家和人民的生活中，出现了许多新的矛盾。要解决这些矛盾，就必须勤俭建国。但是，在许多工业部门、许多地区和企业的干部中，并不是人人都懂得这个道理的。因之，在这次整风运动中，认真检查执行“勤俭建国”方针的情况，对于正确处理人民内部矛盾，对于制定第二个五年计划，对于发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，都是有重大意义的。
    陕西十三个工厂修改建厂方案
    节约两亿四千多万元建设资金
    本报西安7日电　最近，有关部门检查和总结了陕西地区在第一个五年计划内兴建的十三个国营机器制造厂的建设工作，并合理修改了建厂方案，为国家节约两亿四千多万元的基本建设投资。
    这些工厂原来的设计标准普遍过高，事事求全。现在他们根据勤俭建国的原则，制订了节约措施。措施之一是加强各厂之间的配合协作。这些厂的厂址距离一般都比较近，有的只隔一条马路，但是每个厂原来都设计有机修车间、木工车间、铸锻车间、氧气站和消防车库等。这就浪费了大量的建设资金，而且将来投入生产以后，势必出现设备利用率低和人员编制多等缺点。据有关部门计算，如果按原来设计，每个厂建设一个机修车间，每厂机修车间的大型设备利用率都很低，有的只能达到4％左右，而这些大型设备又都是我国不能生产的。又如两个相距很近的工厂都各建一个消防车库，将来又都要配备一套消防设备和人员，也是完全没有必要的。因此，有关部门已经决定按照配合协作的原则，有的两个厂合用一个木工车间或机修车间，也有的三个厂或四个厂合用一个辅助车间。对那些已经建成而协作后又用不上的辅助车间，将改作其他车间利用，机器设备则调到其他需要的地方去。西安郊区三个工厂合用一个木工车间，就节省了七千多平方公尺的建筑面积和一百八十三万多元的投资。有的新建厂还争取和地方工厂协作，如原来计划建设氧气站的工厂已经决定请地方上的氧气厂供应氧气；原来计划建设消防车库的工厂，也争取和临近的地方国营工厂合用一个。
    这些新建工厂的设计定额一般都很低，因而各种机器设备和人力就显得太多。如西安地区新建成的两个机器制造厂，开始生产不久，工人技术还不很熟练，就达到设计的生产能力，将来如果充分发挥设备潜力，将超过原设计能力的一倍到两倍。为了充分发挥这些工厂的生产潜力，有关部门已决定停建两个准备在第二个五年计划中建设的同类型的工厂，以便把国家有限的建设资金用到更需要的地方去。又如陕西地区有一个机器厂，已开始建设一年多，福利区、宿舍和部分小厂房已经建起来，现在国家决定停建这个工厂，把它的计划生产任务放在已经开始生产的同类型的工厂去。它的建筑物厂址，改给一个迫切需要建筑的工厂。这样，既利用了原有的建筑物，又可以加快另一个新厂的建设进度。
    这些工厂的建筑设计标准也过高，如地基过深，墙和防寒层过厚。按照西安地区的气候情况，防寒层六至八公分就可以了，而有些厂的防寒层竟厚达十六至二十公分。因此有关部门已决定适当降低建筑标准。此外，还削减了一些不必要的机器设备，如有些厂每个车间都有自动化吊车，而有些车间的吊车一年只能用上一次，把这些自动化设备去掉，根本不会影响生产。
    有关部门还决定适当缩小这些工厂的建设规模或者分期进行建设，以便有更多的时间来培养和锻炼技术力量，提高管理水平。
