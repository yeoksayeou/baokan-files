This Newspaper Report: The Editorial Department of this newspaper invited sports workers from Beijing to hold a symposium on the 18th. Attendees included Shi Renzhu (Female No. 12 Middle School), Su Shibin (No. 41 Middle School), Professor Li Heding, Associate Professor Zhang Wenguang (Beijing Institute of Physical Education), Professor Lin Qiwu (Peking University), Lecturer Fan Zhengtao, Lecturer Gao Chun (Renmin University), Associate Professor Li Heyun (Tsinghua University), An Jingyu (Locomotive Sports Association), and Chen Chaozheng (Power Sports Association). At the meeting, everyone exposed some of the contradictions existing in current sports work.

    State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) Emphasizes Competition, Neglecting Grassroots
    Promoting the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) Faces Numerous Difficulties
    Professor Li Heding of Beijing Institute of Physical Education said: The central State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) only pays attention to competition work and does not value the development of grassroots mass sports activities. This is putting the cart before the horse. It's true that having leaders of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) take sports teams to various countries has political influence, but State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) Mass Sports Department Director Chen Xian also led a table tennis team abroad while many grassroots sports associations domestically are on the verge of collapse and there are tons of problems with the Labor Defense System (劳卫制). I don't know what the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) is thinking. Lecturer Gao Chun of Renmin University also said: The central State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) doesn't emphasize popularization, but puts a lot of effort into competitions, only paying attention to selecting people who can jump two meters in the high jump. Newspapers and magazines also only promote competitions in a big way. Currently, there is no connection between physical education in primary, middle, and high schools, and there are no successors to excellent athletes. This is the result of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) not combining competition work with popularization work, unilaterally emphasizing competition. Some old sports workers raised this issue several years ago, but the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) ignored it. The Beijing State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) does not delve into grassroots levels, does not understand the situation below, and does not dare to manage the Labor Defense System (劳卫制), only issuing orders and organizing competitions. Lecturer Fan Zhengtao of Renmin University said: The standards and test methods of the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) do not conform to the actual situation and are unworkable, placing a heavy burden on those below. The teaching syllabus must be based on the Labor Defense System (劳卫制), and the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) is constantly changing, making teaching difficult. Associate Professor Li Heyun of Tsinghua University said: Last year, someone died during the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) test at the Russian Language Institute. The matter was not investigated clearly, and some leading departments concluded that the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) could not be promoted. At that time, more than 95% of the students at Tsinghua University were participating in Labor Defense System (劳卫制) exercises, but suddenly they became discouraged. Later, they were told to resume, but so far it has not recovered to 60%. This loss is significant.

    School Leaders
    Should Not Disregard Sports
    At the meeting, almost all physical education teachers pointed out the school leaders' disregard for sports and the discrimination they faced. Some people said that in addition to teaching, physical education teachers also have to tutor students' extracurricular activities, guide school representative teams, and prepare teaching plans and materials, as well as study, so they are always busy from Monday to Sunday. Despite such hard work, old physical education teachers in universities who have been teaching for thirty or forty years are still only associate professors. However, their students and their students' students have become professors in the same school. There are also many physical education teachers in Beijing's middle schools who have twenty or thirty years of teaching experience, but not a single physical education teacher is among the city's top-level teachers, and even second-level teachers are few and far between.

    Someone said that the physical education research group at Peking University asked the leadership to strengthen their leadership, so the leadership sent a young Party member to be the secretary of the research group. Because that Party member didn't understand the work, sometimes the orders they gave were simply laughable. Someone pointed out that a "Three Good" student in a certain middle school was preparing to apply to the Institute of Physical Education after graduation. When he discussed it with the physical education teacher, the teacher encouraged him, but when the class teacher found out, he angrily questioned the physical education teacher, saying, "He is a 'Three Good' student, why should he go to the Institute of Physical Education?"

    Shi Renzhu, a teacher at Female No. 12 Middle School, specifically mentioned the suffering of female physical education teachers and older teachers. She said: According to regulations, physical education teachers' maternity leave is the same as other teachers, but after five months of pregnancy, they can no longer teach students various movements on the sports field, and they cannot teach classes in the short term after giving birth. Older teachers have rich educational experience, but they can no longer demonstrate movements to students on the sports field. What do they do?

    Some teachers said sadly that due to these reasons, some physical education teachers are preparing to change careers, and young students see the situation of their teachers in school and are unwilling to engage in sports work in the future. The old grow old and die, and there are no successors. Who will realize Chairman Mao's "Three Good" in the future? How can we have more and more sports fields and fewer and fewer hospitals in communist society?

    State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) Must Overcome Bureaucracy
    Some people sharply criticized the bureaucracy and sectarianism of the National Sports Commission and the Beijing Sports Commission. Some said that the leading departments of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) are full of officialdom and rarely adopt the opinions of those below. They often assign more tasks than they inspect, use more than they cultivate, and criticize more than they praise. Contact with physical education teachers is limited to refereeing work. Even if physical education teachers are asked to serve as referees, it is considered a "gift or promotion." Therefore, "they are called upon when needed and dismissed when not." When organizing competitions, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) only pays attention to completing tasks and not to the safety of athletes. During the National Cycling Competition held in April of this year, athletes were racing on muddy roads, resulting in someone falling and being carried back, and even several referees overturned. When the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) holds training classes and notifies various units to send people to study, the criteria is Party members first, then League members, and finally the masses. They never consider whether those Party and League members meet the requirements.

    Martial Arts is a Cultural Heritage
    That Should Be Inherited and Promoted
    Zhang Wenguang, Associate Professor of Beijing Institute of Physical Education, said that the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) once proposed the slogan of "sorting out and researching" martial arts, but they said it but did not do it. Where are the people and institutions that are sorting out and researching? It's just shouting empty slogans. In 1953, a martial arts team was established, but it was later disbanded. Not long after, some people advocated for the "internationalization" of sports and wanted to abolish martial arts. Last year, someone proposed promoting martial arts at the CPPCC, and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) became flustered again, hurriedly transferring the head of the martial arts section, who had just been transferred to Beijing Institute of Physical Education to do administrative work, back to his original post. However, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) has never taken any effective measures to promote martial arts. Beijing Institute of Physical Education also violated the principle of "sorting out and researching" and once took very crude measures towards martial arts. President Zhong Shitong publicly announced at a staff meeting: Martial arts is feudal, superstitious, and something that reactionary secret societies and thieves do. We don't want this course, not even the tail end of it. Although many teachers and sports theory experts advocated that Chinese sports should have its own national characteristics, martial arts was arbitrarily cancelled. I believe that martial arts is part of the national cultural heritage and is beneficial to the body, but we who teach martial arts are afraid of being labeled with "counter-revolutionary thoughts" and "feudal secret societies" again, and we dare not speak out even if we have opinions. Now martial arts is going to be offered again at the Institute of Physical Education, but what to teach? How to teach? The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) and school leaders have never given any instructions. It seems that the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) is still not determined to promote martial arts. I hope that the direction and tasks of martial arts will be clarified as soon as possible. Recently, I went to the Nadaam conference in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and saw that the athletes there were very strong and powerful. Last year's champion, Sengge, only won third place this year. The first two athletes were incredibly strong. They grabbed the horns of a large bull with both hands and pushed it down. Developing sports such as weightlifting and boxing in Inner Mongolia can compensate for our lack of heavyweight athletes in these sports and cultivate more and better athletes.

    Associate Professor Li Heyun of Tsinghua University said that seeing martial arts as theft is forgetting one's ancestors. Martial arts is a good cultural heritage. Even Soviet experts believe that Taijiquan has great value in medical treatment.

    Organizing Competitions Requires Considering
    The Characteristics of Industrial Systems
    An Jingyu of the Locomotive Sports Association said that the leaders of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) are subjective and do not understand the situation below. Last year, they ordered all factories and mines with more than 100 people to establish sports associations within seven days and required the Locomotive Sports Association to have 70% of its members participate in Labor Defense System (劳卫制) exercises and 40% to meet the Labor Defense System (劳卫制) standards by the end of the year. As a result, we were making long-distance calls every day, and more than two thousand grassroots sports associations sprang up like a gust of wind. However, the grassroots sports associations did not understand the nature and purpose of the association at all. Among the projects they sent up asking us to help develop were "playing mahjong and playing cards." Once the sports associations were established, the masses needed guidance, venues, and equipment, but the sports associations couldn't solve these problems, and the leaders of the grassroots units thought that the establishment of the sports associations was "wasteful and detrimental to the people." As a result, the sports association cadres had to "kowtow" everywhere. Even if they were busy from Monday to Sunday, they still had to write self-criticisms at the end of each year. Chen Chaozheng of the Power Sports Association said that when the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (体委) organizes competitions, it does not consider the characteristics of the industrial system at all. The national football league is all divided into regions. Each competition drags on for several months, and a game is held every week or two. As a result, we are traveling everywhere, wasting manpower and money, causing dissatisfaction among leaders, employees, and athletes.

    Finally, everyone made some criticisms about the promotion of sports activities. Professor Lin Qiwu of Peking University said that the People's Daily's sports coverage is symbolic, only embellishing the page. He hoped that the newspaper would strengthen sports promotion in the future. Others suggested that the newspaper should hold such symposiums regularly.

    体育工作中的矛盾在哪里
    本报编辑部邀请北京市体育界座谈
    本报讯　18日，本报编辑部邀请北京市体育工作者举行座谈会。到会的有石纫珠（女十二中）、苏士斌（四十一中）、李鹤鼎教授、张文广副教授（北京体育学院）、林启武教授（北京大学）、范政涛讲师、高椿讲师（人民大学）、李鹤云副教授（清华大学）、安景玉（火车头体育协会）、陈朝正（动力体育协会）。会上，大家揭露了当前体育工作中存在的一些矛盾。
    体委抓竞赛忽视基层
    推行劳卫制困难重重
    北京体育学院教授李鹤鼎说：中央体委只注意竞赛工作，不重视发展基层的群众体育运动工作，这是本末倒置。体委的领导者带着运动队到各国走走，是会有政治影响的，但是国家体委群众体育司司长陈先也率领乒乓球队出国，而国内许多基层体协即将垮台，劳卫制问题一大堆，国家体委不知怎样考虑的。人民大学讲师高椿也说：中央体委不重视普及，单在竞赛上下很大功夫，只注意挑选跳高能跳二公尺的人物。报纸杂志也只是轰轰烈烈的宣传竞赛。目前大中小学体育教学不衔接，优秀的运动员后继无人，就是体委没有把竞赛工作和普及工作结合起来，片面强调竞赛的恶果，有些老的体育工作者早在几年前便提出了这个问题，但国家体委却置之不理。北京体委不深入基层，不了解下情，不敢管劳卫制，只是发号施令，搞竞赛。人民大学讲师范政涛说：劳卫制标准、测验办法都和实际情况不符合，行不通，下面负担很重。教学大纲要根据劳卫制，劳卫制又多变，使教学工作不好作。清华大学李鹤云副教授说：去年俄语学院在劳卫制测验中死了人，事情没有调查清楚，有些领导部门就认为劳卫制不能推行。当时清华大学95％以上的同学都参加了劳卫制锻炼，一下子就消沉下来，后来又叫恢复，但是至今还没有恢复到60％，这个损失是很大的。
    学校领导上
    不应轻视体育
    在会上，几乎所有的体育教师都指出了学校领导上对体育的不重视和他们受到的歧视。有的人说，体育教师除了要教课外，还要辅导学生课外活动，指导校代表队，再加上备教案材料、学习，总是从星期一忙到星期七，即使是这样辛勤的工作，在大学里从事三、四十年的体育老教师现在还是一个副教授。但是，他的学生、二代学生都在同校中成了教授。在北京的中学体育教师，也有不少是二、三十年教龄的教师，但是在全市的一级教师中，却没有一个是体育教师，即使是二级教师也是寥寥无几。
    有人说，北京大学体育教研组要求领导上加强对他们的领导，领导上便派来了一个年轻的党员来当教研组的秘书，由于那个党员不懂业务，因此有时发号施令简直令人啼笑皆非。有人指出，某中学一个“三好”学生准备毕业后投考体育学院，当他同体育教师商量时，教师鼓励了他，但班主任知道后怒气冲冲地质问体育教师说，他是“三好”学生，为什么要他去考体育学院？
    女十二中教师石纫珠，特别提到了女体育教师和老年教师的疾苦。她说：按照规定体育教师的产假与其他教师一般，但怀孕五个月以后就不能再在运动场上教学生各种动作了，产后短时期内又不能上课。老年教师虽然有丰富的教育经验，但不能再在运动场上做动作给同学看，她们怎么办呢？
    有些教师沉痛地说，由于这些原因，有的体育教师已准备改行了，年轻的学生在学校中看到了老师的情况，也不愿意将来从事体育工作。年老的老了、死了，后继无人，将来毛主席提出的“三好”谁来实现呢？到共产主义社会时怎么能使运动场越来越多，医院越来越少呢？
      体委要克服官僚主义
    有些人对国家体委和北京市体委的官僚主义和宗派主义提出了尖锐的批评。有的人说，体委领导部门官气十足，很少采纳下面的意见，经常是布置多，检查少；使用多、培养少；打击多、表扬少。对体育教师的联系仅仅是裁判工作，即使是要体育教师出来担任裁判也认为是一种“恩赐、提拔”，因此“呼之即来，挥之即去”。在组织竞赛时，国家体委只注意完成任务，而不注意运动员的安全。在今年4月份举行全国自行车比赛时，运动员就在泥泞的公路上赛车，结果有人跌伤抬了回来，连几个裁判员也翻了车。国家体委举办一些训练班通知各单位派人来学习时，条件是先党员、后团员，最后是群众，他们从不考虑那些党、团员是否符合条件。
    武术是文化遗产
    应该继承和推广
    北京体育学院副教授张文广说，国家体委对武术曾经提出“整理研究”的口号，但是说了不做，整理研究的人和机构在哪里呢？只不过是把空话来喊喊而已。1953年成立了一个武术队，后来解散了。隔了不久又有人主张运动项目“国际化”，要把武术取消。去年有人在政协上提出要推广武术，国家体委又忙乱起来，急急把刚调到北京体育学院作事务工作的武术科科长重新调了回来。但是体委在推广武术这方面始终没有作出什么有效措施来。北京体育学院也违背了“整理研究”的原则，对武术曾经采取了非常粗暴的手段，钟师统院长在一次全院教职员大会上公开宣布：武术是封建的、迷信的，是反动会道门分子、偷盗分子干的事，我们不要这门课，连尾巴也不要。尽管有许多教员和体育理论专家主张中国体育要有自己的民族特色，但是武术这门课还是被武断地取消了。我认为武术是民族文化遗产的一部分，对身体有益处，可是我们教武术的生怕再被扣上“反革命思想”“封建会道门”的帽子，有意见也不敢作声了。现在武术又要在体育学院开课，可是教什么？怎么教？体委和学校领导从来没有过指示。看来，国家体委对推广武术还是没有决心。我希望尽快把武术的方针任务明确起来。最近我到内蒙古自治区参加那达慕大会，看到那里的运动员体格非常强壮，力气很大，去年的冠军僧格今年只得了第三名，前二名的运动员力气惊人，双手把住一头大牛的角一压就压倒了。在内蒙古开展举重、拳击等运动，便能弥补我们在这些项目中最缺少重量级选手的缺陷，培养出更多更优秀的运动员。
    清华大学副教授李鹤云说，把武术看作偷盗行为是把祖宗都忘记了。武术是一项好的文化遗产，太极拳连苏联专家都认为在医疗上有很大的价值。
    组织竞赛要考虑
    产业系统的特点
    火车头体协安景玉说，体委领导上有主观主义，不了解下情，去年限令百人以上的工矿、企业都要在七天内建立体育协会，要求火车头体协在年底有70％的会员参加劳卫制锻炼，40％要达到劳卫制标准。结果我们天天打长途电话，一阵风轰起了二千多个基层体协，但基层体协对体协的性质、目的根本不了解，在送上来要求我们帮助展开的项目中，有“打麻将、打扑克”。体协建立了，群众要指导、要场地设备，体协解决不了，基层单位的领导又认为体协的建立是“劳民伤财”，结果体协干部的工作不得不到处“叩头”，即使是经常从星期一忙到星期七，每年年终时还得写检讨。动力体育协会陈朝正说，国家体委组织竞赛时，根本不考虑产业系统的特点，全国足球联赛都是分区进行，一比赛便拖几个月，而且是每隔一、二星期进行一场比赛，结果我们是到处走，往返旅途，劳民伤财，造成领导、职工和运动员的三不满。
    最后，大家对体育运动的宣传方面提出了一些批评。北京大学林启武教授说，人民日报的体育报道是象征性的报道，只点缀一下版面，希望报纸今后加强体育的宣传。还有人提出希望报社能定期召开这样的座谈会。
