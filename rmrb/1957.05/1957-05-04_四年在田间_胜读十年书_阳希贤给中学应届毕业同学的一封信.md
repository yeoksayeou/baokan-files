Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd. Is it a waste for middle school graduates to participate in agricultural production? Yang Xixian, a model farm tool innovator and youth member of the Yutang Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, published an open letter in the Yuanjiang Daily on April 28, answering this question through his experiences of participating in agricultural production for four years after leaving middle school.

The letter begins with his experience of leaving advanced normal school in 1953 to participate in agricultural production. He said: "At that time, I had the same thoughts as my classmates, feeling that it was a waste of talent for a senior normal student to participate in agricultural production, and that ten years of study were in vain. Weren't my original wishes to go to university and become an expert just bubbles? At the beginning, I couldn't figure out many things." Later, he personally participated in field production and deeply felt that many backward farm tools needed to be improved. From 1953, he began to design and improve farm tools, carrying out calculations, drawings, and other work. At this time, the scientific knowledge of trigonometry, geometry, physics, etc., learned in school, came into use. He used the principle of atmospheric pressure in physics to modify the dragon-bone waterwheel into a closed waterwheel, increasing efficiency by half and saving one-fifth of the cost, which was very popular among the masses. Over the past four years, he has used his book knowledge to frequently work with local farmers and carpenters to jointly study and improve backward farm tools. With the support of the government, a total of sixteen kinds of improved farm tools have been successfully trial-produced, and some improved farm tools have been promoted for use throughout the province. He also participated in rural literacy work. He said: "If I hadn't studied for ten years and didn't have some basic scientific knowledge, there would be no talk of improving farm tools. Is this a waste of knowledge?" He also introduced that in the past few years of rural production, he has learned a lot of production knowledge from the old farmers, and many book knowledge that he did not understand in the past has also been basically understood in these few years of production practice. He said: "This is better than reading for ten years."

The letter also describes the immense honor given to him by the Party, the government, and the broad masses of the people in recent years. He has been repeatedly named a labor model and outstanding member of the Communist Youth League in the county and province, and has twice been to Beijing, where he was honored to meet Chairman Mao. He said, "This is something I never dreamed of before." He said: "The facts of the past few years have educated me that participating in agricultural production, like any other work, has a bright future."

    四年在田间  胜读十年书
    阳希贤给中学应届毕业同学的一封信
    据新华社长沙3日电　中学毕业生参加农业生产是不是浪费？农具改良模范、湖南省沅江县鱼塘农业社青年社员阳希贤4月28日在沅江报上发表了一封写给中学毕业同学的公开信，通过他离开中学参加农业生产四年来的体会，回答了这个问题。
    这封信从1953年他离开高级师范学校参加农业生产的经过写起。他说：“当时也和同学们一样的想法，觉得一个高师学生参加农业生产是大材小用，白读十年书。想起自己原先在学校里计划升大学、做专家的愿望，不是都成了泡影吗？开始时在许多问题上也想不通。”后来，他亲身参加了田间生产，深切感到许多落后的农具需要改良，而且从1953年起就着手设计改良农具，进行计算、制图等工作，这时，在学校里学习过的三角、几何、物理等科学知识，都应用上了。他运用物理学上的大气压力的原理，把龙骨水车改装成密闭式水车，提高工效一半，节省成本五分之一，很受群众欢迎。四年来，他运用书本知识，经常和当地农民、木工共同研究改良落后农具，在政府的支持下，共试制成功十六种改良农具，有些改良农具已在全省推广使用。他还参加了农村扫盲工作。他说：“要是我不读十年书，没有一些基本的科学知识，就谈不到改良农具。这算知识浪费了吗？”他还介绍了几年来在农村生产中，向老农学习不少的生产知识，许多过去没有理解的书本知识，也在这几年的生产实践中基本上弄明白了。他说：“这样胜读十年书。”
    信中还叙述了几年来党和政府、广大群众给予他莫大的荣誉。他先后几次被评为全县和全省的劳动模范和优秀青年团员、并且两次上北京，都荣幸地会见了毛主席。他说：“这是我以前做梦也想不到的事。”他说：“几年来的事实教育了我，参加农业生产和其他任何工作一样，前途是远大的。”
