Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: According to a TASS report, the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences recently sent many investigation teams to various parts of the republic to investigate and study the longevity of residents. The investigation teams will investigate and study the situation of long-lived citizens in various places, collect information about their daily life and nutritional conditions, and formulate a table of longevity of residents of the Azerbaijan Republic.

According to existing data, Azerbaijan currently has 420 elderly people over the age of 90. Some of them are close to or even over 150 years old.

Academician Karayev of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences told a TASS reporter that the investigation teams sent by the Republic Academy of Sciences to various places will study the external conditions and daily life characteristics that promote the longevity of these people, so that in the future, they can systematically synthesize the collected information and draw scientifically based conclusions on how to extend human life. Initial investigations have already shown that longevity has nothing to do with geographical conditions.

    长寿和地理条件没有关系
    阿塞拜疆科学院研究长寿问题的初步结论
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社报道：阿塞拜疆科学院最近派出许多考察团，到共和国各地考察和研究居民的长寿问题。考察团将要调查和研究各地长寿公民的情况，收集有关他们日常生活和营养等条件的资料，并且制定出阿塞拜疆共和国居民的长寿情况表。
    根据现有的资料，阿塞拜疆现在有四百二十位年龄在九十岁以上的老人。其中有些人的年龄接近或甚至超过一百五十岁。
    阿塞拜疆科学院院士卡拉耶夫对塔斯社记者说，共和国科学院派往各地的考察团，要研究促使这些人长寿的外界条件和日常生活的特点，以便今后能够系统地综合所搜集到的资料，并且从中得出如何延长人的寿命的有科学根据的结论。从初步调查中已经可以看出，长寿跟地理条件并没有任何关系。
