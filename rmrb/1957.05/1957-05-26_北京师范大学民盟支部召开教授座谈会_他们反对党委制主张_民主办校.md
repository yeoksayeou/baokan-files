Beijing Normal University Min盟 Branch Holds Professor Forum
They Oppose the Party Committee System and Advocate "Democratic School Management"

(Our Newspaper News) The Min盟 branch of Beijing Normal University held a forum on the 20th for some professors in the school. The attendees included: Lu Zongda, Dong Weichuan, Mao Lirui, Liao Taichu, Hu Ming, Tao Dayong, Tai Shuangqiu, Chen Yousong, Zhang Herui, Luo Zhibu, Zhu Qixian, Xie Sijun, Zhong Jingwen, and Bai Shouyi.

The meeting discussed the school management policy. They believed that implementing "democratic school management" is more appropriate for universities.

Tao Dayong believed that professors should have the right to make decisions on teaching and scientific research. The academic committee does not necessarily have to follow the opinions of the Party committee.

Tao Dayong spoke first, summarizing the content of the previous forum. He said: Although the current Party committee system has its advantages, it still has shortcomings when viewed from past work. This is because there are not many Communist Party members in universities who understand the rules of universities, and it is not easy to run universities well. Some people now advocate "professors governing the school," while others advocate "democratic school management," but we support "democratic school management." The general spirit is that professors should have the right to make decisions on teaching and scientific research in universities in the future. We believe it is feasible to separate the two types of work, with administrative work handled by the administrative meeting, and teaching and scientific research work handled by the academic committee. Matters related to academics and teaching, such as the hiring of professors, promotion of associate professors to professors, promotion of lecturers to associate professors, retention of teaching assistants, and admission of graduate students, should all be the responsibility of the academic committee. The administrative meeting members should report on financial work to the academic meeting. The academic committee should be composed of representatives of professors, associate professors, and lecturers. The Party committee can send representatives to participate and make suggestions at the academic committee meeting, but the academic committee does not necessarily have to follow the opinions of the Party committee. Each department should also establish a departmental academic committee, composed of all professors and associate professors in the department, with representatives of lecturers and teaching assistants participating. It is the highest authority in the department. The department head will of course participate because the department head is elected by professors and associate professors and must be approved by the school academic committee. The department secretary (most of whom are currently Party and League members), who is qualified for this role, and their tasks and powers need to be further studied and resolved.

Zhu Qixian said: Our ultimate goal is for the president to be elected by the academic committee.

Zhu Qixian and Hu Ming explained their reasons for advocating "democratic school management," saying: Democratic school management is intended to change the undemocratic situation. The widespread problem now is that those in charge are not experts. They also said: We must consider reality. The reason we want to use the name "academic committee" is that Moscow University has such a name, and its members are basically professors and associate professors (at this point, Mao Lirui interjected, saying that this is the democratic tradition of the Lomonosov era). Regarding the selection of candidates for the academic committee, they suggested that the president could be the chairman of the academic committee, and the department head could be the chairman of the departmental academic committee. Zhu Qixian also said: We have an ultimate goal and a minimum goal. The ultimate goal is for the president to be democratically elected by the academic committee, and the minimum goal is for the president to be appointed by the State Council. After the academic committee is established, the role of the Party committee is to play an exemplary role among the masses in the school, not just to issue orders.

Zhong Jingwen said: I agree that it is not necessary for the Party committee to lead.

In addition to agreeing with the above opinions, Zhong Jingwen also offered supplementary opinions and criticized the school leadership. He said: Now everyone has opinions about the Party committee system. This does not mean that the Party cannot lead universities, but the question is how to lead. At Normal University, the "three tigers" (referring to the three isms) are very powerful. I have suggested to the Party committee several times that they should invite people to hold forums and publish articles to start a debate, but all have sunk without a trace. Until now, I still do not know the list of the Party committee, presumably they are people who have contributed to the Party and have long Party membership. However, they are unfamiliar with the situation and thinking of teachers, the nature of higher education, university teaching, and the training of graduate students. Therefore, the Party committee's leadership in the past has not achieved the expected results. In this situation, I agree that it is not necessary for the Party committee to lead, and we can think of better ways. But this does not mean that the Party committee should withdraw from the school, but rather that it should play the role it can play. There is still much that the Party committee can do. It should also learn more about professional work, engage in the study and research of a discipline, and slowly become capable of teaching and conducting scientific research. He believes that the original administrative meeting and school affairs committee can still be retained. In addition, an academic committee should be established. Professors can participate in the above three meetings separately to avoid concentrating them on a few professors, which would affect their teaching and research work.

Mao Lirui suggested that the position of department head should be rotated among everyone.

Mao Lirui expressed support for the principles and methods of "democratic school management," but also made some suggestions to prevent professor representatives from becoming detached from the masses and to prevent the shortcomings of the old universities—the emergence of "bosses." It should be stipulated by the system that the president and department heads should have a term of office and oppose long terms of office, which easily lead to bureaucracy. He suggested that the term of office for department heads should be shorter, allowing everyone to take turns. Of course, they can be re-elected. Without a system, democracy is not guaranteed.

Luo Zhibu said: Whether the Party and League reporting system is necessary is worth considering.

Luo Zhibu said: It is impossible and unreasonable for the Party committee system to manage the school. His reasoning is: The reason why the Party member president has not been able to play a role today is because they do not understand the business. Political workers in the army must understand military technology, and the Party committee in the factory must understand production. Why are people who do not engage in business sent to universities? Political work cannot be led well without professional expertise. He said: The Party and League reporting system in schools was necessary in the early days of liberation, but it is worth considering whether it is necessary now. The personnel system of Normal University is controlled by "children," and this situation must also be changed.

Hu Ming advocated the establishment of a professors' association.

At the meeting, Tai Shuangqiu introduced the organizational forms of universities in the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Hu Ming also suggested establishing a professors' association, like the writers' association. Provinces and cities can have branches. This is a mass organization, and it can make suggestions to relevant parties.

Zhang Herui, Chen Yousong, Dong Weichuan, and Bai Shouyi also spoke at the meeting. They basically agreed with democratic school management.

### 北京师范大学民盟支部召开教授座谈会  他们反对党委制主张“民主办校”

    北京师范大学民盟支部召开教授座谈会
    他们反对党委制主张“民主办校”
    本报讯　北京师范大学民盟支部，于20日召开校内部分教授座谈会。参加会议的有：陆宗达、董渭川、毛礼锐、廖泰初、胡明、陶大镛、邰爽秋、陈友松、张禾瑞、罗志甫、朱启贤、谢斯骏、钟敬文、白寿彝。
    会上对治校方针进行了讨论。他们认为在高等学校里实行“民主办校”，是较为合适的。
    陶大镛认为，教学和科学研究工作，教授有决定权。学术委员会不一定尊照党委意见执行。
    陶大镛首先发言，综合介绍了上次座谈的内容。他说：现行的党委制虽有好处，但如从过去的工作上看，还是有缺陷的。因为在高等学校中的共产党员现在了解高等学校的规律的人还不多，要办好高等学校是不容易的。现在有人主张“教授治校”，有人主张“民主办校”，但我们赞成“民主办校”。总的精神是：将来在高等学校中的教学和科学研究工作，教授有决定权。我们认为可行的是要把两类型的工作分开，把行政工作交由行政会议处理；关于教学和科学研究工作由学术委员会处理。如教授聘请、副教授升教授、讲师升副教授，留助教、收研究生等与学术、教学有关的事项，均由学术委员会负责。关于财务工作，要由行政会议的成员向学术会议报告。学术委员会的组成，由教授、副教授、讲师代表组成。党委可派代表参加，在学术委员会议上可提出建议，但学术委员会不一定遵照党委的意见执行。系也要成立系学术委员会，由全系教授、副教授组成，有讲师和助教代表参加。它是系的最高权力机构。系主任当然参加；因为系主任是由教授和副教授选出的；选出后，还要由校学术委员会通过。系的秘书（现在绝大部分是党团员），究竟什么人可以胜任，它的任务、职权还有待进一步研究解决。
    朱启贤说：我们的最高纲领是校长由学术委员会选举。
    朱启贤和胡明解释他们主张“民主办校”的理由时说：民主办校是为了把不民主的情况改变一下。现在普遍存在的问题是：当家的不内行。并说：要照顾到现实，我们之所以要采用学术委员会的名称，是因为莫斯科大学有这样的名称，它的成员基本上也是教授、副教授组成的（这时，毛礼锐插上一句说，这是罗蒙洛索夫时代的民主传统）。关于学术委员会的人选问题，他们提议校长可做学术委员会主席，系主任可做系学术委员会主席。朱启贤还说：我们有最高纲领和最低纲领，最高纲领是校长由学术委员会民主选举产生，最低纲领是校长由国务院任命。学术委员会产生后，党委会的作用，是在校内群众当中发挥模范作用，不能只发号施令。
    钟敬文说：我同意不一定要党委领导。
    钟敬文除同意以上意见外，还提出了补充意见和对校方领导提出批评。他说：现在大家对党委制有意见，这不是说，党不能领导高等学校，问题在于如何领导。在师大，三条老虎（指三个主义）很厉害。我曾向党委提过数次，应请人开座谈会，发表文章争鸣起来，但都石沉大海。直到现在，我还不知道党委的名单，想必是对党有贡献、党龄长的人。但他们对教师的情况、思想，高教的性质，大学教学，培养研究生等都是陌生的。所以过去党委领导不能起到人所期望的效果。在这种情况下，我同意不一定要党委领导，还可以想出更好的办法。但这并不意味着党委退出学校，而是要发挥它能发挥的作用。党委可作的事还很多，还应多学点业务，从事一门学问的学习、研究，慢慢地做到能教学和进行科学研究。他认为，原来的行政会议和校务委员会这两个机构仍可保存，另外，再设立一个学术委员会。以上三个会教授可以分别参加，以免集中在少数教授身上，影响他们的教学和研究工作。
    毛礼锐建议，系主任让大家轮流做。
    毛礼锐对“民主办校”的原则、办法表示赞成，但又提出一些建议，要防止教授代表脱离群众、防止旧大学的毛病——把头的出现。要用制度规定下来：校长、系主任应有任期，反对任期过久，过久了容易产生官僚主义。他建议系主任任期短些，让大家轮流做，当然连选得连任。没有制度，民主就没有保证。
    罗志甫说：党团汇报制度是否必要，值得考虑。
    罗志甫说：党委制管学校是不可能的，也是不合理的。他的理由是：党员校长今天所以未能发挥作用，就是不懂业务，党在军队中的政治工作人员要懂军事技术，工厂党委要懂生产，为什么高等学校都派些不搞业务的人呢？政治工作不通过业务是领导不好的。他说：在学校中的党、团汇报制度，在解放初期是需要的，现在是否必要，值得考虑。师范大学的人事制度是娃娃们在掌握，这种情况也必须改变。
    胡明主张成立教授协会
    在会上，邰爽秋介绍了苏联、美国、英国、法国高等学校的组织形式；胡明还建议成立教授协会，像作家协会一样。省、市可设有分机构，这是群众团体，有意见可向有关方面建议。
    会上发言的还有张禾瑞、陈友松、董渭川、白寿彝，他们基本上赞成民主办校。
