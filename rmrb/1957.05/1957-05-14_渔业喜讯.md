Fishery Good News

　　Famous Hubei Fish Fry Reports First Harvest

　　In recent days, good news of fish fry harvests have been constantly coming from the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province. From April 25th to now, more than 510 million fish fry have been caught. The Han River, which was previously thought not to produce fish fry, has turned out to be a rich fish fry ground, according to the netting situation this year.

　　The fish fry caught during this period are commonly known as "Rapeseed," referring to the fish fry hatched during the rapeseed flowering season. According to aquatic experts, these fish fry are of the same quality as those hatched after "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer). (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Freshwater Fish Development in the Hangjiahu Area

　　The Hangjiahu area of Zhejiang, known as the "Land of Fish and Rice," has seen great development in freshwater fish this year. The total number of fish fry stocked in the area is more than 59 million, an increase of 70.3% compared to last year. According to the person in charge of the local aquatic department, it is entirely possible that the Hangjiahu area will increase its production of freshwater fish by 5,000 tons this year if there are no special disasters.

　　Increased Income for Fishery Cooperative Members in Dongtou County

　　Since the spring and summer fishing season began in late March, Dongtou County, Zhejiang Province, has achieved an unprecedented harvest. According to statistics, from late March to April 23rd, 165,000 dan of fish have been caught, completing 68% of the spring and summer production target, an increase of more than three times compared to the same period last year. The average value per dan is 12 yuan, totaling 1.98 million yuan, which is 50% higher than the total value of the spring and summer production in the four months of last year. With the good harvest of the fishery cooperatives, the income of the members has also greatly increased. The average income of each member in the county has reached more than 150 yuan. Liang Donghe and his son, members of the First Fishery Cooperative in Nantang Township, received more than 80 yuan for the four months of the spring and summer fishing season last year, but this year they have received more than 400 yuan in just over a month.

    渔业喜讯
  著名的湖北鱼苗初报丰收
    这几天，湖北省长江、汉水两岸不断传出鱼苗丰收的喜讯。从4月25日到现在，已经捞捕到五亿一千多万尾鱼苗。一向只认为不产鱼苗的汉水，从今年下网的情况来看，原来是个丰盛的鱼苗场。
    这一段打捞的鱼苗俗名“菜花籽”，就是指油菜扬花时期孵化的鱼苗。据水产专家说，这种鱼苗和“立夏”后的鱼苗比较，质量一样好。（新华社）
    杭嘉湖地区淡水鱼发展
    素称“鱼米之乡”的浙江杭嘉湖地区，今年淡水鱼有了很大的发展。全区放养的鱼秧计有五千九百多万尾，比去年增加了70.3％。据当地水产部门负责人谈，如没有特殊灾害，今年杭嘉湖地区增产十万担淡水鱼是完全可能的。（傅刚实）
    洞头县渔业社社员收入增多
    浙江洞头县的春夏汛渔业生产，自3月下旬开始以来，已获得空前丰收。据统计，自3月下旬到4月23日止，已捕鱼十六万五千担，完成春夏汛生产指标的68％，比去年同期增产三倍多；每担平均价值是十二元，共计一百九十八万元，比去年春夏汛四个月生产的总值还高出五成。随着渔业社的丰收，社员们的收入也大大增加了。全县每个社员的收入，平均达一百五十元之多。南塘乡第一渔业社社员梁东和父子，去年春夏汛四个月分到八十多元，今年仅一个多月的时间就分到四百多元。（吕玉珊）
