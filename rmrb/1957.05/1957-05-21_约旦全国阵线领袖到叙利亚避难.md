Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 20th: The Syrian newspaper "Al-Jumhur" reported on the 18th that the leader of the Jordanian National Front, Dr. Abdul Rahman Shukeir, had arrived in Damascus and requested to be treated as a political refugee.

The newspaper also reported that the head of the Jordanian transportation agency, Ghazi Arabiyat, also arrived in Damascus on the same day and requested political asylum.

Upon arriving in Damascus, Shukeir told reporters that the U.S. Embassy in Jordan was doing everything possible to alienate Jordan from Syria and Egypt, forcing Jordan to abandon its policy of an independent Arab nation. To achieve this goal, the U.S. Embassy first exploited the current Jordanian Foreign Minister, Samir Rifai.

Shukeir said that Jordan has now essentially accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He pointed out that members of the National Socialist Party and the reactionary "Muslim Brotherhood," which have been banned in Syria, participated in the Jordanian conspiracy.

    约旦全国阵线领袖到叙利亚避难
    据新华社20日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚“群众报”18日报道，约旦全国阵线的领袖阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·舒凯尔博士已经到达大马士革，要求把他当作政治避难者。
    这家报纸还报道，约旦交通机关的领导人加齐·阿拉比特也在同一天到达大马士革，要求给予政治避难。
    舒凯尔在到达大马士革以后对记者说，美国驻约旦大使馆竭尽全力离间约旦同叙利亚和埃及的关系，迫使约旦放弃阿拉伯独立国家的政策。为了达到这个目的，美国大使馆首先就利用了约旦现任外交大臣萨米尔·里法伊。
    舒凯尔说，约旦现在实质上已经接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”。他指出，在叙利亚已经被禁止的国家社会党和反动的“穆斯林兄弟会”的成员参加了约旦阴谋。
