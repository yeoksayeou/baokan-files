Seeking Teachers and Friends Among Non-Party Members Chen Mingshu

I.
The People's Daily published my speech at the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 8th of this month on the 9th, but it happened to omit the section where I said, "Party members should seek teachers and friends among non-Party members." This is a pity. Is this sentence offensive? I don't think so. As long as non-Party members remember the source of their blessings, they should not forget their roots. Everyone should remember that without the People's Liberation Army who risked their lives to establish the country, where would our current regime be? Without the wise decisions and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in a series of socio-political reform movements, such as Land Reform, Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, the Elimination of Counter-Revolutionaries Campaign as well as the extensive Marxist-Leninist ideological education, where would our current broadest socialist democratic life be? Since liberation, non-Party members have accepted the ideological education of the Communist Party and have humbly learned from Party members, which is, in effect, taking Party members as teachers. If we did not go through this training, who could guarantee that we would not make serious mistakes? Maintaining a firm stance and distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy are the main subjects in our political life. The ideological foundation of non-Party members in the past can easily "lead a wolf into the house" or "negotiate with a tiger for its skin" without realizing it, which is harmful and terrible for socialist construction. In the past few years, the Party's education and our self-transformation have basically reached a certain level, and we should all be grateful. Party members have also been very helpful to us. Based on my personal experience in the past few years, their teachings have been of great help to me. Not only senior leaders but also middle and lower-level Party members have been of great help to me. It is truly "stored in my heart, never to be forgotten."

From this, it is not difficult to think about what we can do to repay the Party. What help can we provide to Party members? How can we feel at ease if we only receive without giving back? I am writing this article with this sincere intention. From this perspective, I think the Party Central Committee's instruction that democratic parties should not engage in their own rectification campaigns for the time being means that we should devote ourselves to the Party's rectification movement to help Party members.

II.

Chairman Mao said at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference: "Marxism is developing." This sentence left a deep impression on me. In fact, nature, society, and thinking are constantly developing, and people's knowledge of the objective world is endless. Marxism is universally applicable because it is a universal truth. It never treats objective things as immutable but recognizes and analyzes problems specifically and historically based on the movement and development of objective things themselves. The Communist Party has used this weapon to formulate a program of struggle, unite and lead millions of people to advance the wheels of history. Marxism is indestructible and always accurate because it can correctly utilize all principles and never stick to conventions, so it can always maintain its lively vitality. Without this, all classic sayings become dead things. The significance of our opposition to dogmatism today is important. Viewing Marxism from a developmental perspective is the true Marxism. Chairman Mao's instructions are absolutely correct.

The progress of history always relies on people's past and present experiences and lessons. People's research on nature extends infinitely as the sun expands in space, and research on social development is always based on all developments in time and space. All developments in nature and society that evolve human history are nutrients that Marxists must constantly absorb. We are in a limited time and space, and our knowledge is indeed too small. Some Party members, complacent with their past meritorious achievements and class superiority, believe that they have reached the pinnacle of knowledge once they join the Party, arbitrarily despising everything and thinking that "all the beauty in the world is within themselves." Their complacency has increased their arrogance, and of course, they will look down on non-Party members. In this way, it is natural to easily regard the Party organization as a sectarian clique and coat Marxism-Leninism with a mysterious color.

At present, the era is evolving rapidly and amazingly. The Communist Party members, who bear the responsibility of liberating all mankind, still have a long way to go in the future and must broaden their minds and elevate their vision. How can they isolate themselves, confine themselves to sectarianism, make subjective judgments, and engage in bureaucracy? With Premier Zhou Enlai's talent and beauty, he was able to compromise on the international stage and be humble, even his enemies cannot deny his virtues. During his visit to eleven countries, large and small, he also held a sincere attitude of seeking friends and knowledge. All the people of the country should learn this virtue. How can ordinary Party members say that they should not seek teachers and friends in the big family of the motherland?

Today, the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are shrinking, and the contradictions within the people have been revealed. This is a good sign of our country's unity and prosperity! Those who only believe in weapons, use their hydrogen weapons and missiles to create international tension, not knowing that the development of this kind of weapon science is enough to eliminate war. This is the inevitable result of the dialectic of weapons themselves. The development of progressive mankind's demand for peace, happiness, culture, and knowledge is like rivers rushing to the sea, unstoppable.

With China's size, long history, rich and colorful cultural relics, and outstanding talents in various places, the country has attached importance to talents since liberation, giving them preferential treatment and adding courtesy. Although most of them have found their places, there are still many who have not been fully utilized or used properly, and there are still many who are scattered at home and abroad and have not been discovered. If Party members, especially leading comrades, can humbly seek teachers and friends among non-Party members, it can break the bad habits of sectarianism, broaden the horizons of Party members, and enable Marxism to achieve greater development and promotion under China's special cultural and historical conditions. This is why I sincerely and earnestly advise Party members to seek teachers and friends. It is also my humble devotion to the Party.

III.

The above are all suggestions to Party members, and now I want to say a few words to non-Party members. How should we respond to the call to "help the Party rectify its style of work"? I believe that in addition to maintaining a firm stance and clarifying the Party's rectification policy, we must first solve a thought problem: in the past movements, when the big storms came, some good people were indeed wronged. Their experiences should be sympathized with, and the Party should quickly do a good job of handling the aftermath. Today, everything has become a thing of the past, and everyone should no longer have any grudges. I have an analogy: all the past movements, for the 600 million people of the country, were like "hoping for clouds and rain in a great drought." When the wind and rain were mixed, if someone happened not to bring rain gear, or if someone's house was not strong, they would of course be soaked, or their lives might be injured due to the collapse of the house. This is the reason, and there is no reason to blame heaven and earth. As long as everyone thinks from the big picture, personal grievances are insignificant. I believe that with the level of awareness of non-Party members today, they will not mix personal emotions to take revenge, and I also believe that Party members can estimate the ideological development of non-Party members, humbly accept opinions from all parties, dare to admit mistakes, and seriously check and improve their work.

IV.

Confucius said: "When three men are walking together, there is sure to be one who can act as my teacher." Xunzi said: "Those who agree with me and are right are my friends, and those who disagree with me and are right are my teachers." This is a valuable legacy left by ancient Chinese philosophers, and it also reflects the good virtues of our ancestors. We should all engrave it in our minds. As for our mentors, such as Marx's admiration for Hegel and Feuerbach, Lenin once warned Communist Party members to learn civilized business practices from capitalists. These are all examples of the Party learning from non-Party members.

All criticisms that are made in good faith should be welcomed, and critics should be regarded as teachers and friends, especially those who can "point out" their faults face-to-face, as Xunzi said, "those who disagree with me and are right" are simply teachers. For example, what Comrade Zhang Naiqi criticized in the editorial of the People's Daily at the symposium that day was correct on the matter. If there are some inaccuracies, it is definitely not out of good intentions, and well-intentioned criticism is always good. The ancients also said: "Good medicine tastes bitter but is good for the disease," which is a well-known saying. I would like to offer this to the comrades of the People's Daily, and also to all the comrades of the leading Party that I respect the most.

### 向非党人士求师求友

    向非党人士求师求友	　陈铭枢	一
    本月9日人民日报登载我8日在中共中央统战部座谈会上的发言，恰好把我讲的“党员应向非党人士求师求友”一段话漏掉了。这很可惜。难道这句话刺耳吗？我想未必。非党人士只要饮水思源，都应当不忘本。人人都应记着，如果没有出生入死、打江山的人民解放军，哪里有我们今天的政权呢？如果没有党中央和毛主席的英明决策，正确领导了——土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、三反、五反、肃反——一系列的社会政治改革运动，以及广泛的马克思列宁主义思想教育，哪里有我们今天的最广泛的社会主义的民主生活呢？解放以来，党外人士都接受了共产党的思想教育，并虚心向党员同志学习，实际上也就是以党员为师。如果不经过这一番锻炼，谁还能保证不犯严重的错误呢？站稳立场，分清敌我界限，是我们政治生活中的主要课题。党外人士过去的思想基础，很容易“引狼入室”、“与虎谋皮”而不自觉，这对于社会主义建设是有危害性的、可怕的。几年来，党对于我们的教育以及我们的自我改造，基本上已达到了一定的程度，我们都应当知所感激。党员同志也大有助于我们，就我几年来的切身经历来说，他们的教益对我的帮助很大，不只高级领导同志，就是中下级的党员同志，对我也有很大的帮助。真是“中心藏之，何日忘之”。
    由此，不难想到，我们之报答于党者是什么？我们对于党员同志的帮助又是什么？有施无报，何能心安理得！我撰本文，就是本此一片赤忱，并由此出发，我想党中央所指示的，民主党派暂不搞本身的整风，就是要我们投身于党的整风运动中来帮助党员同志。	二
    毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上讲到：“马克思主义是发展的。”我对于这句话的印象极深。实际上，自然，社会和思维是无时无刻不在发展中，人们对于客观世界的知识是永无止境的。马克思主义之所以放诸四海而皆准，因为它是普遍真理，始终没有把客观事物当成一成不变的东西，而是根据客观事物本身的运动发展，具体地、历史地来认识问题，分析问题。共产党就是掌握了这个武器来制定斗争纲领，团结与领导了千百万人来推动历史车轮的前进。马克思主义之所以无坚不摧，百发百中，就在于它能正确地活用一切原理原则，决不墨守陈规，所以能始终保持其活泼泼的生命力量。不如此，一切经典名言，都成为死的东西。我们今天之所以要反对教条主义，意义是重要的。从发展来看马克思主义，才是马克思主义。毛主席的指示，绝对正确。
    历史的前进，总是依靠于人们过去、现在的经验和教训。人们对于自然界的研究，随着太阳在空间的扩延而探究于无穷无际，对社会发展的研究，也总是根据时间、空间的一切发展来进行探究。演进着人类历史的自然和社会的一切发展的东西，都是马克思主义者时刻必须吸取的养料。我们虱处于有限的时间和空间中，具有的知识确太渺小了。一些党员同志们，狃于以往的汗马功勋和阶级的优越感，一经入党，便以为攀登了知识的顶峰，任意鄙夷一切，自以为“天下之美，为尽在己。”其故步自封，增长了自己的骄气，当然会瞧不起党外人士。这样，自然容易把党组织目为宗派小集团，把马克思列宁主义涂上了一层神秘的色彩。
    目前，时代演进急剧，大足惊人，负有解放全人类责任的共产党员，今后仍任重道远，必须开拓胸襟，高翥视域，岂能自封山头，囿于宗派，主观臆断，徙倚官僚？以周恩来总理之才之美，在国际舞台上，樽俎折衷，虚己下人，即敌人亦不能抹煞其美德。他在访问十一个大小国家中，同样抱着嘤鸣求友、求知识的诚挚。全国人民均应学习这种美德。一般党员怎能说不应在祖国大家庭中求师求友呢？
    今天，敌我矛盾，日益缩小，人民内部矛盾，已显露出来，这是我们国家团结、兴盛的好景象！彼唯武器论者，挟其氢武器、导弹来制造国际紧张，不知此种武器科学的发展，适足以消灭战争，这是武器本身辩证法的必然结果。进步人类要求和平幸福与文化知识的发展，正如江河之赴大海，莫之能御。
    以中国之大，历史之悠久，文物之丰富多采，卓越之士，各地有之。解放来国家重视人材，优予延纳，礼遇有加，虽大半各得其所，但仍多未尽其用、用不得其当，至于流散在海内外而未被发现者，仍不在少数。苟党员同志，特别是领导同志，能够虚心在党外求师求友，一则可破宗派主义的陋习，再则可以使党员同志开拓眼界，使马克思主义在我国特殊的文化历史条件下，得到更大的发展、发扬。我所以一往情深，殷殷以求师求友忠告于党员同志者在此，也是我对党的区区之忱。	三
    以上所述，均在对党员同志建议，现要对非党人士略申一二。我们应怎样响应“帮助党整风”的号召呢？我认为除了站稳立场与明确党的整风方针外，必须首先解决一个思想问题——在以往各个运动中，大风暴来到的时候，确有一些好人受了委屈。他们的遭遇，应予同情，党应该迅速做好善后工作。到了今天，一切都成过眼云烟，大家都不应再有什么芥蒂了。我有一个比喻：过去所有运动，对全国六亿人民说来，都是一个“若大旱之望云霓”。在风雨交加的时候，恰巧谁没有带雨具，或谁的房屋本身根本就不牢实，他们当然要淋着一身雨，或者由于房屋的倾倒，也可能伤害生命。事理乃尔，没有理由值得怨天尤人。只要大家从大处着想，个人的委屈，是微不足道的。我相信，以党外人士今天的觉悟水平来看，都不会渗杂个人情绪来借端报复，也相信党员同志也能估计到党外人士的思想发展，虚心接受来自各方的意见，勇于承认错误，认真地检查工作，改进工作。	四
    孔子说：“三人行，必有我师焉”。荀子说：“是吾而当者，吾友也，非吾而当者，吾师也”。这是我国古代哲学家留下的一分宝贵遗产，也反映了我国祖先的优良美德。我们均应把它铭诸座右。以我们的导师而论，如马克思之服膺黑格尔和费尔巴哈，列宁曾告诫共产党员要学习资本家的文明经商。这都是党向非党学习的范例。
    凡是出于善意的批评，都应当欢迎，批评者都应被视为师与友，特别是能“面剌”其过者，如荀子所说的“非吾而当者”那简直是老师了。如那天在座谈会上，章乃器同志批评人民日报社论的话，就事论事，是正确的。假如有不完全正确之处，也决不是不出于善意，善意的批评，总是好的。古人又说：“良药苦口利于病”，这是至理名言。谨以此贡献于人民日报的同志们，并以贡献于我最敬爱的领导党的全体同志们。
