Chairman Mao Zedong's Speech

    Respected Comrade Voroshilov,
    Dear Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today, after Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage have completed their friendly visits to various parts of China, we are gathered together with them again, feeling particularly close and happy.

    Chairman Voroshilov, with great enthusiasm and tireless energy, visited many places in our country for nearly twenty days, had cordial meetings with the broad masses of workers, farmers, students, and people from all walks of life in our country, and conveyed the fraternal feelings of the Soviet people to millions of Chinese people. All this is a tremendous encouragement to the Chinese people and has left a deep and unforgettable impression on the Chinese people.

    During these days, the whole world has once again witnessed the rock-solid unity and close friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. This unity and friendship are not only beneficial factors in the socialist and communist construction of our two countries, but also an important part of the unity of socialist countries and a reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, will continue to do everything in their power to constantly consolidate and develop the unity, friendship, and cooperative relations between our two countries.

    Chairman Voroshilov will soon conclude his friendly visit to China. I would like to take this opportunity to express once again on behalf of the Chinese people our deep gratitude to him, and sincerely ask him to convey the most sincere friendship of the Chinese people to all the Soviet people.

    Let us raise our glasses:

    To the increasing prosperity and strength of

    毛泽东主席的讲话
    亲爱的伏罗希洛夫同志，
    亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，当伏罗希洛夫主席和他的随行人员在中国各地进行了友好访问以后，我们又同他们欢聚在一起，感到特别亲切和愉快。
    伏罗希洛夫主席以巨大的热情和不倦的精力，在将近二十天的时间内，访问了我国许多地方，同我国广大的工人、农民、学生和各界人士作了亲切的会见，把苏联人民的兄弟感情转达给千百万的中国人民。这一切，对中国人民是一个极大的鼓舞，并且给中国人民留下了深刻难忘的印象。
    在这些日子里，全世界再一次看到中苏两国人民坚如磐石的团结一致和亲密无间的深厚友谊。这种团结和友谊，不仅是我们两国社会主义和共产主义建设事业中的有利因素，而且也是社会主义各国团结的重要部分，也是世界和平和人类进步事业的可靠保证。中国人民和苏联人民一样，将继续尽一切力量，为不断巩固和发展我们两国的团结友好和合作关系而努力。
    伏罗希洛夫主席不久就要结束他在中国的友好访问了。我愿意借此机会代表中国人民再一次向他表示深深的感谢，并且衷心地请他把中国人民最诚挚的友情带给全体苏联人民。
    让我们举杯：
    为我们伟大的盟邦苏联的日益繁荣和富强，
    为伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义和维护世界和平的事业中获得新的成就，
    为苏联政府和苏联共产党的领导同志们的健康，
    为中苏两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为伏罗希洛夫同志的健康和长寿，
    干杯！
