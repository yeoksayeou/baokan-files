Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 12th: The session of the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic concluded on the 11th. The proceedings of this National Assembly session, the first since the October events of last year, demonstrated that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government enjoyed widespread support and trust from the parliamentary representatives.

The session, which began on May 10th, discussed the work summary report of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government presented by Prime Minister Kádár at the opening meeting on May 9th. More than ten representatives who spoke during the discussion expressed their support for the policies and measures of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and expressed satisfaction with the achievements made in various fields since the establishment of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. In addition, the vast majority of representatives pointed out the counter-revolutionary nature of the October events of last year and expressed gratitude to the leaders of the Party and the Government for saving the Hungarian people's democratic system from the threat of the restoration of the capitalist system. Kish, Executive Member of the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, and Antos, Minister of Finance of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, also spoke about the Party and Government's cultural and artistic policies and the current economic situation of the country. In discussing the Party and Government's cultural and artistic policies, Kish said that Hungary would also implement China's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," but it must be ensured that the enemies of the people have no possibility of using this policy to influence the development of Hungarian culture.

At the end of the discussion, Prime Minister Kádár spoke. He said that the representatives attending the meeting had reached a consensus on the main issues. The fact that the representatives put forward different opinions on some specific issues is a healthy phenomenon, and reaching a consensus after discussing different opinions must become the basis of Hungary's domestic policy.

Prime Minister Kádár pointed out that the unanimous support of the government's measures by the representatives who spoke shows that the Hungarian state is developing on a healthy basis. The trust of the broad masses of the people is the highest reward for the government. He asked the representatives to work hard to help the government achieve the main tasks currently facing the country, and called on them and all Hungarian working people to continue to heighten revolutionary vigilance against enemies at home and abroad.

Prime Minister Kádár also talked about the issue of enlivening the work of the Patriotic People's Front, the attitude that should be taken towards the participants in the October counter-revolutionary events, and issues such as the price increase of certain commodities.

The meeting unanimously adopted Kádár's report and approved the work of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government since its establishment.

Finally, after a brief discussion, the meeting unanimously adopted a bill to amend individual chapters of the Republic's constitution. According to the bill, the highest administrative body of the state is the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic (the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government). The meeting approved the new national emblem and the red-white-green tricolor flag, and resolved to extend the term of office of the current National Assembly representatives by two years.

    匈牙利国民议会会议闭幕
    代表一致赞成工农革命政府工作  通过新的国徽及红白绿三色国旗
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　匈牙利人民共和国国民议会会议已经在11日闭幕。去年十月事件后第一次举行的这次国民议会会议进行的情况表明，匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利工农革命政府受到了议会代表们普遍的拥护和信任。
    会议从5月10日起开始讨论卡达尔总理在5月9日开幕会议上所作的关于工农革命政府的工作总结报告。讨论时发言的十多位代表都表示拥护社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的政策和措施，并且对工农革命政府成立后在各方面所取得的成就表示满意。此外，绝大多数代表还指出了去年十月事件的反革命性质，并且对从资本主义制度复辟的威胁下拯救了匈牙利人民民主制度的党和政府的领导人表示感谢。社会主义工人党临时中央委员会执行委员基什和工农革命政府财政部长安托什在发言中还分别谈到了党和政府的文化艺术政策和目前国家的经济情况。基什在谈到党和政府的文化艺术政策时说，匈牙利也将实行中国那样的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，但是，必须保证人民敌人没有任何可能利用这个政策来影响匈牙利文化的发展。
    在讨论结束的时候，卡达尔总理发了言。他说，出席这次会议的代表们在主要问题上都取得了一致的认识。代表们在有些具体问题上提出了不同的意见，这是一种健康的现象，不同的意见经过讨论后达到一致，这必须成为匈牙利国内政策的基础。
    卡达尔总理指出，发言的代表们对政府的措施的一致拥护表明，匈牙利国家是在健康的基础上发展着。广大人民群众的信任是对政府的最高奖赏。他要求代表们努力帮助政府实现国家当前面临的主要任务，并且号召他们和全体匈牙利劳动人民继续对国内外敌人提高革命警惕性。
    卡达尔总理还谈到了活跃爱国人民阵线的工作的问题以及对待十月反革命事件的参加者所应采取的态度和关于某些商品涨价等问题。
    会议一致通过了卡达尔的报告，赞成工农革命政府成立以来的工作。
    最后，会议经过简短的讨论以后，一致通过了修改共和国宪法的个别章节的法案。根据法案，国家最高行政机构为匈牙利人民共和国部长会议（匈牙利工农革命政府）。会议通过了新的国徽及红白绿三色国旗，并且决议把本届国民议会代表任期延长两年。
