Senior Researchers Zhang Dajun and Others Criticize
"The Academy of Sciences Doesn't Seem Like an Academic Research Institution"

    (Our Newspaper) The Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Academy of Sciences invited senior researchers from various social science institutes to a forum at 3:00 PM on the 16th to discuss issues of internal contradictions among the people. Speakers at the meeting included researchers Zhang Dajun, Chen Mengjia, Yu Yuan'an, Zhang Zunxun, Xu Bingchang, and Huang Wenbi. They respectively criticized bureaucracy and other problems in the leadership work of the Academy of Sciences and the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department.

    Many speakers believed that the Academy of Sciences did not resemble an academic research institution but rather an yamen (government office). The Academy's administrative structure was bloated, with administrative staff outnumbering researchers by a factor of one, which they saw as the root cause of bureaucracy in leadership work. Mr. Yu Yuan'an said that the Academy of Sciences had six bureaus and many cars. However, the focus of leadership was not on academic leadership but on arranging cadres. When the Academy of Sciences summarized its work, it did not summarize the research results of each year but rather said how many people had been added and how many institutes had been established this year. In reality, many institutes were just empty shells with few researchers. Because there were too many administrative personnel, expenditures on scientific research were reduced, affecting dormitory allocation, book purchases, and other areas. Therefore, he suggested vigorously reducing the administrative structure.

    Speakers criticized the work of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department. Mr. Zhang Dajun said that the department had rarely sent people to the various institutes to understand the situation in the two years since its establishment. Mr. Huang Wenbi said that there were only sixty-odd members of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department, which was not commensurate with the development of social science undertakings nationwide. Moreover, many of these sixty-odd people held concurrent positions, and few were dedicated to research. The allocation of seats for department members also did not take into account all regions of the country, with some regions, such as the Northwest and Northeast, having too few people. All of this prevented the department from effectively undertaking leadership work. Mr. Zhang Zunxun said that the Academy of Sciences did not pay enough attention to social science research work and was not as well-equipped in terms of manpower as other universities. For example, the problem of supplementing researchers for the Institute of History I and II has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the Academy of Sciences cannot participate in some international academic activities and must instead organize the strength of universities to participate.

    When mentioning Party-masses relations, Mr. Chen Mengjia said that the Party-masses relations in the Academy of Sciences were relatively distant. Some Party cadres in charge only emphasized the unity of non-Party researchers and did not pay attention to the unity between the Party and the masses. At present, the contradiction between the Party and the masses is the main contradiction. He also criticized the phenomenon of the leadership of the Institute of Archeology not trusting older researchers. Mr. Huang Wenbi also believed that older researchers should be respected more, and only with mutual trust could their initiative be brought into play.

    In addition, Mr. Yu Yuan'an also mentioned that he believed that the current practice of dividing the Institute of History into three institutes was not appropriate. This made it difficult to transfer researchers and allocate book funds. At the same time, these three institutes all study Chinese history, have common characteristics, and need to be interconnected. He suggested unifying the scheduling of the three institutes. He also criticized the current phenomenon of the Academy of Sciences emphasizing science and engineering while neglecting humanities, which was reflected in the allocation of book funds, with too little funding for humanities. In recent years, it had only relied on old collections, with few new books purchased. He hoped to change this unreasonable phenomenon and establish a social science library. Mr. Zhang Zunxun mentioned that after Tsinghua University was converted into a university of science and engineering, the school refused to hand over all the liberal arts books collected by the old Tsinghua University to other research institutions, but instead purchased a large number of liberal arts books. He believed that this was a manifestation of departmentalism.

    Some comrades also criticized the slow action of the Academy of Sciences in this rectification movement. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM and will continue to be held in the future.

### 高级研究人员张达钧等人提出批评  “科学院不像个学术研究机关”

    高级研究人员张达钧等人提出批评
    “科学院不像个学术研究机关”
    本报讯　科学院哲学社会科学学部在16日下午三时，邀请社会科学各研究所高级研究人员，座谈人民内部矛盾问题。在会上发言的有研究员张达钧、陈梦家、余元盦、张遵骝、徐炳昶、黄文弼等人。他们分别就科学院和哲学社会科学学部领导工作中的官僚主义等问题提出批评。
    不少发言者认为，科学院不像一个学术研究机关，而像一个衙门。科学院行政机构臃肿，行政人员超过研究人员一倍，这是领导工作中官僚主义的根源。余元盦先生说，科学院有六个局，汽车很多。但领导工作的重点不在学术领导，而在安排干部。科学院作工作总结时，不是总结每年研究的成果，而是说今年又添了多少人，设了多少所。实际上好多所还是空架子，研究人员不多。由于行政人员过多，就减少了科学研究经费的开支，使宿舍分配、图书购置等都受到影响。因此他建议大力削减行政机构。
    发言者对哲学社会科学学部的工作提出批评。张达钧先生说，学部成立两年来，很少派人深入各研究所了解情况。黄文弼先生说，哲学社会科学学部委员只有六十多人，这和全国社会科学事业发展的情况不相适应。而且这六十多人中好多人是兼职，专心作研究的不多。学部委员的名额的分配，也没有照顾全国各个地区，有的地区如西北、东北人数太少。这一切使学部不能很好的担负领导工作。张遵骝先生说，科学院对社会科学的研究工作重视不够，在人力配备上也不如其他大学。例如历史一、二所补充研究人员的问题至今没有解决。因此有些国外的学术活动，科学院参加不了，反而要组织大学的力量去参加。
    在提到党群关系时，陈梦家先生说科学院的党群关系比较隔膜，有些党员负责干部只强调非党研究人员的团结，而不注意党群间的团结，目前党群关系间的矛盾是主要的矛盾。他还批评了考古所领导对老的研究人员信任不够的现象。黄文弼先生也认为应该多尊重老研究人员，只有彼此信赖，才会发挥他们的积极作用。
    此外，余元盦先生还提到他认为目前历史研究所分为一、二、三所的作法不太合适。这样对调配研究人员，分配图书经费都有困难，同时这三个所研究的都是中国历史，有共同的性质，需要相互联系。他建议，将三个所统一调度。他又批评目前科学院有重理轻文的现象，这表现在图书经费的分配上文科方面的经费太少，这几年来只依靠旧有的藏书，新买的书不多。他希望改变这种不合理的现象，设立社会科学图书馆。张遵骝先生提到清华大学改为工科大学以后，该校所有旧清华所藏文科书籍，不肯交给其他研究机关，反而还大量采购文科书籍，他认为这是本位主义的现象。
    有些同志还批评了科学院在这次整风运动中行动迟缓的现象。会议在六时结束，以后还将继续举行。
