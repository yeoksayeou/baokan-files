Xinhua News Agency Report: Former President of the National Association of Women Lawyers of the United States, Springer, said in a speech in Los Angeles recently that women in the United States now account for more than half of the voters and more than one-third of the American labor force, but they are relatively underrepresented in government leadership positions.

Springer's speech was published in the recently published magazine "Important Speeches of the Day." She said: The words "Equality Before the Law" are engraved at the entrance of the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. However, there has never been a female judge on the Supreme Court, which has the power to make final judicial decisions. In terms of legislation, only sixteen of the five hundred and thirty-one members of the newly elected 85th Congress are women - one less than last year's record high. In the executive branch: the U.S. President's cabinet is still entirely composed of men.

She went on to say that the situation in state governments is not much better. There is currently not a single female governor or territorial governor in the United States. Some state legislatures do not even have a single woman. Moreover, some states still exclude women from serving on court juries, in the same way as they do with lunatics and criminals. Most states do not even have a single female judge. There are approximately fifty female judges in total in the United States, but they all work in lower courts.

    “在法律面前一律平等”是空谈
    美国妇女政治地位可怜
    据新华社讯　美国全国女律师协会前主席斯普林格最近在洛杉矶发表演说时说，美国的妇女现在占选民的一半以上，并且占美国劳动力的三分之一以上，但是她们在政府领导工作中却相对地没有地位。
    斯普林格的演说发表在不久前出版的“当今重要演说”杂志上。她说：在美国国会和最高法院的进口处刻了这样的话：“在法律面前一律平等”。但是，在有权作出最后的司法决定的最高法院中从来不曾有过一个女法官。在立法方面，新任第八十五届国会的五百三十一名议员中只有十六个人是妇女——比去年的最高纪录少一个人。在行政方面：美国总统的内阁现在仍然是清一色的男人。
    她接着说，州政府的情况也并不好一些。美国目前没有一个州的州长或者领地的总督是妇女。某些州议会中连一个妇女也没有。而且有一些州仍然把妇女同疯子和罪犯一样排斥她们在法院的陪审团中工作。大多数的州连一个女法官都没有。在美国总共大约有五十位女法官，但是她们全部都在下级法院中工作。
