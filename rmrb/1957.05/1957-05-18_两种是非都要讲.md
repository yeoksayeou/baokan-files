    Speak of Both Kinds of Right and Wrong
        Ren Yan
    When there is a contradiction, it is necessary to distinguish between right and wrong. Since it is a contradiction, there must be two sides, and distinguishing between right and wrong must be done on both sides. If only one side of right and wrong is discussed, right and wrong cannot be clearly distinguished. If a contradiction occurs between the masses and the leadership, it is necessary to distinguish between the right and wrong of the masses and the right and wrong of the leaders.
    However, some comrades, when dealing with contradictions between the masses and the leadership, often only talk about one side of right and wrong, and mostly only talk about the wrong of the masses, not the wrong of the leaders. Since the wrong of the leaders is not discussed, it is difficult to clarify the right and wrong of the masses. Because, the right of the masses is often the wrong of the leaders. Therefore, when talking about the right and wrong of the masses, in reality, it is only talking about the wrong of the masses and not the right of the masses. These comrades should be reminded not to think that this can put the leaders in a justified and proactive position. In fact, it is just the opposite. As the saying goes, justice resides in the hearts of the people, and everyone knows whether right and wrong are clearly distinguished. When the masses feel that the leaders are not reasoning with them fairly, they will naturally not be convinced. This is only temporary suppression, and the problem is not solved. Therefore, to seriously resolve the contradiction between the leadership and the masses, it is important to first distinguish between the right and wrong of the leadership, and then distinguish between the right and wrong of the masses; after the right and wrong of the leaders are clarified, admitting mistakes to the masses, and correcting shortcomings, then, when going to distinguish between the right and wrong of the masses, the masses will naturally be more willing to accept correct opinions and change unreasonable demands.

    两种是非都要讲
        任严
    有了矛盾，就要分清是非。既是矛盾，必有两个方面，分是非也就得两面都分。只论一方面的是非，是非就不能分明。如果矛盾发生在群众和领导之间，就需要既分清群众的是非又分清领导的是非。
    可是，有些同志在处理群众和领导之间的矛盾的时候，却常常是只讲一方面的是非，而且大多是只讲群众的是非，不讲领导者的是非。既然不讲领导者的是非，也就很难讲清群众的是非。因为，群众的是，往往就是领导者的非。因此，在讲群众的是非的时候，实际上是只讲群众的非而不讲群众的是。应该提醒这些同志，不要以为这样就可以使领导者处于有理的主动的地位，其实，恰恰相反。俗话说，公道自在人心，是非是不是分清了，大家心里自然清楚。当群众感到领导者不和他们公平说理的时候，自然不会心服口服，这只是暂时的压服，问题并没有解决。所以，要认真解决领导同群众之间的矛盾，重要的还是，先分清领导的是非，再去分群众的是非；领导者的是非分清了，向群众承认了错误，纠正了缺点，这时候，再去分群众的是非，群众自然就比较容易接受正确的意见，改变不合理的要求。
