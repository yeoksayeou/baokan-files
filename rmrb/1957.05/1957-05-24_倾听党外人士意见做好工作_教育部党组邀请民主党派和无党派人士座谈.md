Listening to the Opinions of Non-Party Members to Improve Work
The Ministry of Education Party Group Invites Democratic Parties and Non-Party Figures to a Discussion

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, Yesterday morning, the Chinese Communist Party's Ministry of Education Party Group invited representatives from various democratic parties within the ministry and non-party figures to a discussion, to hear their criticisms and opinions of the Ministry of Education's Party organization. Twenty people from the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Jiusan Society, and non-party figures participated in the discussion.

    Wang Xiaoshan, a non-party figure in his seventies, said with excitement that after the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement in 1942, the People's Republic of China was established seven years later in 1949. Now, another rectification movement is underway this year, and he believes that even greater achievements will be made in seven years. He said that bureaucracy is very serious in the leadership of the Ministry of Education, and work is passive. He believes that the Ministry of Education should strengthen ideological and political education in schools at present. He suggested revising this year's literacy plan to fully utilize the strength of middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education this year to do a good job in literacy work. When talking about textbooks, he said that it is too difficult for high school students to study classical literature, and they cannot learn it, and some teachers cannot teach it either. He believes that this approach is misleading young people. He suggested that students can study an outline of Chinese literary history, and the classical literature course in high school should be suspended. There are also many problems with the textbooks for junior high and primary schools, and the Ministry of Education should also consider rewriting textbooks that are in line with China's actual situation.

    In his speech, Pu Yuancheng first criticized the Party leadership of the Ministry of Education for its detachment from reality, bureaucracy, and subjectivism in teaching plans and courses. He said that in the implementation of comprehensive technical education, due to the lack of investigation and research on this aspect by the ministry, the work was fully launched at the beginning, but it did not work out later. He said that since last year, middle schools have squeezed out the political class because other courses have increased, which is not right. Talking about the lack of political class textbooks, he said that the original political class textbooks in various places could have been appropriately revised and used, but the ministry insisted that all places rewrite them. As a result, it is impossible to compile all the political class textbooks for all six grades of middle school together in all places.

    Regarding the problem of too many course categories in middle schools, he said that the reduction of several courses from the excessive number of courses in middle schools could have been studied and resolved from the publishing house to the Ministry of Education. However, it has not yet been determined, and some places dare not print textbooks. The textbooks for the next semester cannot be guaranteed to be supplied in time. This issue should immediately attract the attention of the ministry's leadership. He criticized the sectarianism of the Party organization within the ministry, saying that non-Party cadres have positions and responsibilities, but no power, and there is a great gap between the Party and non-Party members. Party members are more special than the non-Party masses. The Party does not trust us enough, and Party member directors do not talk to us on weekdays, and sometimes they lose their temper with us.

    Zhang Jiyu said that there are many problems in the leadership of the Ministry of Education, but this rectification is limited to general calls and has not taken action. He said, "After I came to the Ministry of Education, I felt that the boundary between Party and non-Party members was very deep. The work managed by non-Party ministers is also interfered with by Party member ministers, resulting in positions without power and the inability to give full play to the enthusiasm of non-Party cadres." He said that the hierarchy of the Ministry of Education is very strict. During my time at the Ministry of Education, I have never seen a minister come to the department once, and it is very difficult for the director to talk to the minister about work. In feudal society, there was also a system of visiting the virtuous. Why can't the minister come down and talk to the lower-level cadres? He said that the Party group of the Ministry of Education is the core of the leadership of the Ministry of Education, but in my opinion, it has not played a core role. He said, "I am a Bai nationality. Please consider whether there is great Han chauvinism in the leadership of the Ministry of Education. The minister rarely manages the work of the National Education Department. Does this mean that the Ministry of Education is only the Ministry of Education of the Han nationality?"

    Yang Zhaojun said that before 1949, I worked in the Northwest Liberated Area. At that time, I received a lot of help and encouragement from the Party, and I did not feel like a non-Party member. Since I was transferred to the Ministry of Education in 1953, my feelings are completely different from the past. The opinions I put forward for my work are not only not valued, but also often hit, and there is no follow-up to any opinions I put forward. Some meetings that are related to my work and that I can and should participate in, I am not allowed to participate in. He also suggested that the Party should treat democratic parties and intellectuals with a correct attitude in the future, give non-Party members positions and powers, and not engage in small circles.

    Dong Chuncai, Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Education, said that the criticisms and suggestions everyone has put forward today are of great help to our rectification. In order to hear more criticisms and suggestions from everyone, the discussion will continue to be held.

    倾听党外人士意见做好工作
    教育部党组邀请民主党派和无党派人士座谈
    本报讯　昨日上午，中共教育部党组邀请部内各民主党派代表及无党派人士座谈，听取他们对教育部党组织的批评和意见。参加座谈的有民盟、民进、九三学社及无党派人士二十人。
    七十多岁的无党派人士王肖山怀着激动的心情说，中国共产党经过1942年的整风，在七年以后的1949年，建立了中华人民共和国，今年又进行整风了，相信在七年后，将会取得更伟大的成就。他说，教育部领导上的官僚主义是很严重的，工作被动。他认为教育部在目前应加强学校的思想政治教育。他建议修改今年的扫盲计划，充分运用今年不能升学的中、小学毕业生的力量，做好扫盲工作。谈到教材问题时，他说，高中学生学习古典文学，太深，学不了，有些教师也教不了。他认为这样的做法是误人子弟。他建议，可以让学生学习中国文学史概要，高中的古典文学课暂停。初中、小学的教材也有很多问题，教育部也应考虑重新编写切合中国实际的教材。
    濮源澄在发言中，首先批评教育部党领导上在教学计划、课程等方面有脱离实际的官僚主义、主观主义。他说，在实施综合技术教育方面，由于部里对这方面的情况调查研究不够，一开始就把这工作全面展开，后来行不通。他说，自去年以来，中学因为别的课程增加了，挤掉了政治课，这是不对的。谈到政治课教材的缺乏问题，他说，各地原有的政治课教材，本可以进行适当的修改使用，而部里一定要各地重新编写，结果，中学六个年级的全部政治课教材要各地一起编写，是不可能编起来的。
    对于中学课程门类过多的问题，他说，对中学过多的课程，把它减去几门，从出版社到教育部，本来是可以研究解决的。但是至今还未确定下来，有些地方不敢印课本。下学期的教科书是不能保证及时供应的。这问题应立即引起部领导上的重视。他批评部内党组织的宗派主义说，党外干部是有职、有责，但是无权，党与非党的隔阂很大。党员比党外群众特殊。党对我们不够信任，党员司长平日不与我们谈话，有时还会对我们发脾气。
    张纪域说，教育部领导上所存在的问题很多，而这次整风只限于一般号召，没有行动起来。他说，我到教育部以后，感觉党与非党人士这个界线划得很深。非党部长管的工作，党员部长也要插进来管，因而造成有职无权，不能发挥非党干部的积极作用。他说，教育部的等级森严。我在教育部的期间，没见部长到司里来过一次，司长想找部长谈工作都很困难。在封建社会里，还有访贤制度。部长为什么不能下来和下级干部谈谈呢？他说，教育部的党组是教育部的领导核心，在我看来还没起到核心的作用。他说，我是白族，请教育部领导上考虑教育部是否存在着大民族主义思想，部长很少管民族教育司的工作，难道说教育部就是汉族的教育部？
    杨兆钧说，1949年以前，我在西北解放区工作。那时我得到党的很多帮助和鼓励，自己并不感到是党外人士。自1953年调来教育部以后，我的感觉完全与过去不同。我对工作所提的意见，不但得不到重视，而且经常受到打击，提什么意见都没有下文。有些与我工作有关，可以而且应该参加的会，也不给我参加。他并建议党在今后应以正确态度对待民主党派人士和知识分子，要给党外人士有职有权，不要搞小圈子。
    教育部党组书记董纯才说，今天大家提出的批评和建议，对我们整风有很大的帮助。为了听取大家更多的批评和意见，座谈会将继续举行。
