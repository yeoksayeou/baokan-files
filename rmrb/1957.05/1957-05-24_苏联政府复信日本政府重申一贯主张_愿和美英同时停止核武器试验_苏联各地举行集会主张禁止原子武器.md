Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd dispatch - TASS, Moscow dispatch: On May 22nd, Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Tevosian, delivered the Soviet government's reply to the Japanese government's memorandum of May 10th, 1957. In its reply, the Soviet government expressed regret that the Japanese government did not respond affirmatively to its suggestion that Japan jointly appeal to the US and UK governments to reach an agreement on stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

In its memorandum, the Japanese government believed that, given the Soviet Union's continued unannounced testing of atomic weapons, it would be inappropriate for Japan to immediately jointly propose to the UK and US to halt testing. The Japanese government also requested the Soviet Union to support its opinion of prior registration of nuclear weapons tests and requested that countries possessing nuclear weapons should, on their own initiative, cease testing as early as possible before an effective international agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing could be reached.

In its reply, the Soviet government pointed out that it could not agree with the statement that it was inappropriate for the Soviet Union and Japan to jointly appeal to the US and UK, nor could it agree with the proposal to require the Soviet Union to unilaterally stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons while allowing the US and UK to continue doing so.

　　If the Soviet Union stopped testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, it would place the Soviet Union in an unequal position with other major powers testing such weapons, which would harm the security of the Soviet Union.

The reply said that the Soviet government had stated that it was willing to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons as long as the other major powers manufacturing atomic and hydrogen weapons, namely the United States and Britain, also simultaneously stopped testing such weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd dispatch: Scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research near Moscow firmly advocated banning atomic weapons in a resolution, demanding that countries quickly reach an agreement on stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

On the 20th, scientists from the institute and local residents held a mass meeting. Institute Director Blokhintsev, Chinese physicist Wang Ganchang, and physicists from other countries spoke at the meeting, supporting the demand to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution calling for a halt to the testing of weapons of mass destruction.

Many enterprises in Moscow held mass rallies after work on May 21st, responding to the statement issued by the Soviet Peace Committee in support of the demand to stop the testing of nuclear and hydrogen weapons. The "Sickle and Hammer" steel factory held a mass rally of thousands of workers, firmly demanding an unconditional ban on the testing of atomic weapons. (Attached picture)

    苏联政府复信日本政府重申一贯主张
    愿和美英同时停止核武器试验
    苏联各地举行集会主张禁止原子武器
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联驻日本大使捷沃西安在5月22日把苏联政府回答日本政府1957年5月10日的备忘录的回信交给日本政府。苏联政府在回信中遗憾地表示，它建议日本共同向美国和英国政府呼吁，建议在停止试验原子武器和氢武器方面达成协议，日本政府对这个建议没有表示肯定态度。
    日本政府在它的备忘录中认为，在苏联继续不经预告地试验原子武器的情况下，日本立即同苏联联合向英国和美国提出关于停止试验的建议是不合时宜的。日本政府还要求苏联支持它的事先登记核武器试验的意见，并且要求拥有核武器的国家能在禁止试验核武器的问题达成有效的国际协定以前，就自己主动地尽早停止试验。
    苏联政府在回信中指出，苏联政府不能同意说苏联和日本共同向美国和英国呼吁是不合时宜的这样一种说法，也不能同意要求苏联单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器而让美国和英国继续做这种试验的建议。 
    苏联停止试验原子武器和氢武器就会使苏联同其他在试验这类武器的大国处于不平等的地位，这就会损害到苏联的安全。
    回信说，苏联政府曾声明它愿意停止试验原子武器和氢武器，只要制造原子武器和氢武器的其他大国即美国和英国也同时停止试验这种武器。
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　莫斯科附近的联合原子核研究所的科学家们在一项决议中坚决主张禁止原子武器，要求各国就停止试验原子弹和氢弹迅速达成协议。
    这个研究所的科学家20日和当地居民举行了群众大会，研究所所长勃洛欣采夫、中国物理学家王淦昌和其他国家的物理学家在会上讲了话，支持停止试验原子武器和氢武器的要求。大会一致通过了关于要求停止试验大规模毁灭性武器的决议。
    莫斯科许多企业在5月21日工作完毕后举行群众大会，响应苏联保卫和平委员会为支持关于停止试验核武器和氢武器的要求而发表的声明。“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂举行了数千工人的群众集会，坚决要求无条件禁止试验原子武器。（附图片）
