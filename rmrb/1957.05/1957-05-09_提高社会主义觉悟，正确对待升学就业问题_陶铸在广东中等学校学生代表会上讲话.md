Raise Socialist Awareness, Correctly Handle the Issues of Schooling and Employment
Tao Zhu's Speech at the Guangdong Secondary School Student Representative Conference

(Our Newspaper) Guangzhou – The Guangdong Province held a Secondary School Student Representative Conference in Guangzhou from April 22nd to 27th. The main purpose of this conference was to discuss how to enhance the socialist awareness of students throughout the province and how to correctly approach the issues of graduation, further education, and employment. More than 600 representatives attended the conference.

The conference was personally overseen by Tao Zhu, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and leading comrades from the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education also participated. They studied together with the student representatives the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production" and jointly discussed the Party's educational policy. Tao Zhu, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretary Qu Mengjue also held separate discussions with representatives from urban areas, rural areas, and female students, patiently explaining and answering the questions, difficulties, and opinions raised by the representatives, fundamentally dispelling many ideological doubts they had about further education and employment.

At the end of the conference, Comrade Tao Zhu gave a summary based on the opinions discussed by the representatives. He first explained the educational policy. He said that since liberation, the education sector in Guangdong Province has developed greatly. In 1953, middle schools enrolled 70,000 students, and this year it is planned to enroll 150,000. According to Guangdong's financial resources, the average annual development of secondary schools is about 20,000, which is a normal phenomenon and cannot be increased further. Secondary education is general education, and its main purpose is to improve the cultural level of all people. Therefore, secondary school education is not exclusively for further education, but to train more students with a secondary education level to participate in production. This is the correct direction. Young people must have foresight. Graduates who cannot go on to further education should prepare to go to the most difficult places to become farmers or workers. Comrade Tao Zhu said that some students say it is a waste of talent for middle school graduates to participate in agricultural production, which is incorrect. Many of our national government cadres are junior and senior high school graduates, and their biggest shortcoming is that they become cadres as soon as they leave school, lacking practical experience, so it is easy for them to become detached from the masses. To remedy this shortcoming, cadres will be selected from workers and peasants in the future. Graduates participating in production, improving production, and being supported by the masses will be elected as their representatives. You are the successors of socialism.

Regarding overseas Chinese students, Comrade Tao Zhu said that overseas Chinese love their country, and many overseas Chinese students have returned to the motherland after many hardships. Schools should help them do well in their studies and strive for more people to be admitted to schools. But if they fail the exam, those with money at home can go to remedial schools or study on their own. Those who do not have these conditions are also hoped to go to the countryside. Overseas Chinese who cannot continue their studies, do not want to participate in production, and want to go abroad, of course we have no reason not to let them go abroad, but we must make it clear to them: foreign countries are not better than domestic, and we still hope that they will participate in production like domestic youth. Domestic youth can endure hardship, and overseas Chinese have a tradition of labor and can also endure hardship.

Regarding how to go to the countryside, Comrade Tao Zhu said that all localities should establish special organizations to do a good job in investigation and unified arrangement. Generally, graduates from the county should return to the countryside of their own county and township. Those who have more graduates can go to places with fewer graduates. All agricultural cooperatives should make plans for how many people are needed and be prepared to welcome them. Comrade Tao Zhu especially emphasized the importance of doing a good job in propaganda. Propaganda should be carried out among the whole Party, all cadres, and the people of the whole province to create a social atmosphere where labor is glorious and not laboring is shameful. He said: The current social atmosphere is not good, which puts a lot of pressure on graduates, especially female students. Currently, many female students are eager to find someone to marry, wanting to find a place to settle down, unwilling to return to their hometown to participate in production and be subjected to cold words. Some start dating when they are only fifteen or sixteen years old, which is not good. Young women should have revolutionary heroism, study hard in school, and after graduation, if they cannot go on to further education, they should participate in production with young men and build a career. It is not too late for men to marry at thirty and women at twenty-five. Comrade Tao Zhu said that young people should have ideals. Young people in an era cannot only think about themselves but should do things that are beneficial to the majority of people. Being afraid of hardship, greedy for petty advantages, and wanting comfort are not ideals and have no future.

### 提高社会主义觉悟，正确对待升学就业问题  陶铸在广东中等学校学生代表会上讲话

    提高社会主义觉悟，正确对待升学就业问题
    陶铸在广东中等学校学生代表会上讲话
    本报讯　广东省于4月22日至27日在广州举行中等学校学生代表会议。这次会议主要是讨论如何提高全省学生社会主义觉悟和如何正确对待毕业生升学、就业问题。参加这次会议的代表有六百多人。
    会议由中共省委第一书记陶铸同志亲自掌握，中共省委文教部、青年团广东省委、广东省教育厅的领导同志也都参加了这次会议。他们同学生代表一起学习人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论，共同讨论党的教育方针。省委第一书记陶铸同志和书记区梦觉同志还分别同城市、农村、女学生的代表举行座谈，根据代表们提出的疑问、困难和意见，耐心地作了解释、答复，基本上解除了代表对升学、就业问题存在的许多思想疑虑。
    会议最后由陶铸同志根据代表讨论的意见作了总结。他首先对教育方针做了说明。他说，解放以后，广东省教育事业有了很大发展，1953年中等学校招生七万人，今年准备招生十五万，根据广东省财力，中等学校平均每年发展二万人左右，是正常的现象，不能再多了。中等教育是普通教育，主要目的是提高全体人民的文化水平，因此中等学校教育不是专为升学，而是培养更多的具有中等文化水平的学生参加生产，这是正确的方向。青年人要有远见，不能升学的毕业学生就准备到最困难的地方去当农民或工人。陶铸同志说，有的同学说中学毕业生参加农业生产是大材小用，这是不对的。现在我们国家机关干部，很多是初中、高中毕业生，他们最大的缺点就是从学校出来就当干部，缺乏实际锻炼，因此，很容易脱离群众。为了补救这个缺点，今后补充机关干部，要从工人、农民中提拔。毕业生参加生产，把生产搞好了，群众拥护你们，就会把你们选做他们的代表，你们是社会主义的接班人。
    关于华侨学生，陶铸同志说，华侨是热爱祖国的，许多华侨学生都是经过千辛万苦才回到祖国，学校应当很好地帮助他们搞好功课，争取更多的人考取学校。但是如果考不上，家里有钱可以进补习学校或自修，没有这些条件的，希望也到农村去。有家在海外的，不能升学，又不愿参加生产而想出国的，当然我们没有理由不让他们出国，但是要向他们说清楚：国外不比国内好，还是希望他们和国内青年一样参加生产，国内青年可以吃苦，华侨有劳动传统，也一样可以吃苦。
    关于怎样去农村的问题，陶铸同志说，各地要成立专门机构，做好调查，统一安排，一般的是本县的毕业生回到本县本乡的农村去，有多的可以到毕业生少的地方去。城市不能升学的毕业生，又不能自学，本市容纳不下的，就分配到毕业生少的县去。各地农业社需要多少人，要做好计划，并且准备欢迎。陶铸同志特别强调要做好宣传工作，要在全党、全体干部、全省人民中展开宣传，造成劳动光荣、不劳动可耻的社会舆论。他说：现在社会舆论不好，给毕业生的压力很大，特别是对女学生。目前有许多女学生急于找对象，想找个落脚的地方，不愿回乡生产受人冷言冷语，有的只有十五六岁就开始谈恋爱，这是不好的。女青年要有革命的英雄主义，在学校努力学习；毕业后不能升学，就和男青年一起参加生产，搞番事业，不要马上结婚，男子三十岁，女子二十五岁结婚都不迟。陶铸同志说，青年人应当有理想，一个时代青年不能仅仅为个人设想，要做对大多数人有好处的事情，怕吃苦，贪便宜，想舒服不是理想，是没有前途的。
