    Night Fog
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    (I)
    At a little past seven in the evening, Qu Yuanhua, the tall auto team leader, was driving a truckload of concrete out of the mixing station when he ran into heavy fog. White fog, like puffs of thick smoke, rushed in with the wind and quickly dispersed. In a short time, the construction site was a blur of white, and the streetlights along the way became fiery red balls. The newly built highway’s loose soil and ice, having been crushed all day by the endless stream of trucks, had turned into many muddy pits. The road was difficult to travel.
    “Little Qu, I can’t see anything on the road, we have to stop the trucks,” drivers on the empty trucks returning to the mixing station all said this to Qu Yuanhua.
    Qu Yuanhua became anxious when he heard this. He knew very well that the fog had started during the day. The large smokestack of the thermal power plant, which was usually used as a landmark for identifying directions, was obscured. Many people were getting lost in this vast Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation construction site. However, to welcome the start of construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel main plant, the overpass bridge on the factory area avenue began pouring the main beams this afternoon. Was the concrete finished being transported? The construction of the overpass bridge must not be affected! He shouted to the empty trucks returning to the station:
      “You must wait for me at the station, don’t rush home!”
    As soon as his truck arrived at the construction site, the construction site director greeted him: “Driver comrade, what should we do? The mixing station called and said that the driver comrades are unwilling to drive. We only need three more truckloads of concrete to build these two main beams for this bridge. If the concrete is not delivered, the main beams will have to be scrapped and reworked, resulting in a loss of more than four thousand yuan. We will also have to send people to dig out the poured concrete before we can redo it!”
    Qu Yuanhua had been a truck driver at the construction site since 1955 and understood the properties of concrete: if its surface solidifies, and then more is poured on top, the new and old concrete will not stick together, which will cause cracks, leading to scrapping and reworking. After considering it, this Communist Youth League member said, "I will go back and mobilize them to come. If they don't come, I will work all night to deliver these three trucks of concrete.”
    On the way back to the station, Qu Yuanhua was worried that the others would not be able to wait and would drain the water from their trucks and go home to eat, which would be impossible to fix. So he drove back as fast as he could in fifth gear.
    Who knew that the more urgent things were, the more obstacles there would be. Just as he drove to the front of a culvert, he encountered a truck full of goods that was stuck in a mud pit, blocking the way. The drivers who regularly ran this road knew very well that this culvert was the most difficult place to pass. Qu Yuanhua, who wished he could fly back to the station, saw that the truck in front of him could not move, so he pushed open the door and shouted, "I'll pull you out!" "Great, but there's no iron rope." "Then I'll borrow one."
    (II)
    At this time, the dispatch room of the mixing station was also very tense. Dispatcher Old Li repeatedly pleaded with the drivers: "If just any three comrades would make one more trip, the problem would be solved." But the drivers kept shouting: "In this kind of weather, on these roads, if the truck falls into the ditch and is damaged, who will take responsibility?" The dispatchers Old Ma from the transportation company and the deputy director of the construction site also rushed over, but the drivers were still determined not to drive. That day, the word had spread around the construction site: in the afternoon, a ferry had departed from the city, but because it could not see the waterway clearly in the fog, it lingered on the Yangtze River for two hours without being able to dock. Finally, a group of boatmen familiar with the waterway were sent out in small boats to bring the passengers ashore. The fog was even thicker now than it had been in the afternoon, and it was also at night. Dispatcher Old Ma was an experienced driver and understood that driving in such a situation was risky. It depended entirely on the drivers' voluntary actions and could not be forced. However, the drivers were unwilling to go, but the construction site was short just three truckloads of concrete! They pinned their last hope on Qu Yuanhua.
    Qu Yuanhua's truck horn sounded. The three men hurried out the door. Before Qu Yuanhua got out of the truck, they shouted:
      "Little Qu, what should we do? They are all unwilling to go."
      "Then I can work all night if necessary."
      "Don't do that, Little Qu. One person's strength is small, you have to get them to go too. Three trucks can pull it all at once."
      "I couldn't convince those three. Can I do it?" Little Qu was a little hesitant in his heart. But he thought to himself: "It's for the sake of work, can I be afraid of being rejected?"
    He followed the three men into the dispatch room and saw several drivers huddled around the stove, heads down, smoking and warming themselves. He immediately shouted, "If these three trucks of concrete are not transported, we will lose more than four thousand yuan!" But everyone looked up, looked at each other, and then lowered their heads again without speaking. "Which comrade will pull one truck? I will solve it myself by pulling two trucks." Still no one made a sound.
    It was at this time that Little Qu thought: such things must rely on Party and League members!
    However, none of these people was a Party member. He immediately looked for League member Zhang Jintang, who lived in Group Two, and had worked on the same truck with him in the past. But this League member said: "I'm timid. I can't see anything on the road. I just came back in third gear at a slow speed." Little Qu became anxious and rebuked him, "You have to consider our responsibility. If we Party and League members don't do this, who will?"
    These words startled Zhang Jintang. But he retorted: "What if I fall into the ditch?" "I'll pull you up." Zhang Jintang hesitated for a while before saying, "Okay, I'll go with one truck."
    Little Qu immediately went to find League member Li Zunsan, who lived in Group One and was a demobilized soldier. Li Zunsan replied with a sad face: "No, my truck is underpowered. When climbing steep slopes, I almost can't climb up even in first gear." "My truck is new, if you can't climb up, I'll tow you."
    The three Communist Youth League members decided to drive! Immediately, Old Li was so happy that he immediately called the mixing platform and told them to mix three trucks of concrete at once. The deputy director of the construction site also took out a notebook from his pocket and recorded the names of the three of them while asking. Little Qu knew what he wanted to do, so he waved his hand and said, "Forget it, don't write it down, everyone is doing it for work." "No, no. Overcoming difficulties like this should be commended."
    (III)
    After loading the concrete, as soon as the truck hit the road, they discovered that the weather was even worse. The streetlights, which had already become like red fireballs, were now even dimmer. When the headlights were turned on, the light was reflected back by the fog, a blinding white expanse that made people dizzy. The fierce cold wind poured in from the front window, stinging people's noses and eyes, and making their faces ache. The numb hands could not very deftly grasp the steering wheel, which was made slippery by the frost and fog. At this time, Little Qu paid even more attention to holding the steering wheel, staring straight ahead, not daring to blink.
    When the truck reached the most difficult culvert, a thought flashed through his mind: what if all three trucks fall into the mud pit? He immediately flashed the red light on the back of his truck, honked the horn, stopped the truck, and greeted the two trucks behind him:
    "Let me go first. If I get through, I will use a flashlight to shine on the ground. When you see this signal, follow me. If I get stuck in the pit, I will shake the flashlight randomly on both sides, and you should not come."
    After speaking, Little Qu put the truck in first gear and leaned out of the door, staring intently at the two front wheels. The truck rumbled for a while, then lunged forward. The two wheels landed right on the edge of the removable road panel. Little Qu was happy in his heart: "Ah, this is great." After the truck passed the culvert, he stepped on the mud and walked back, using a flashlight to illuminate the road panel for the two trucks behind, beckoning and retreating, leading the two trucks over.
    However, there was still a very narrow one-way road ahead, with steep slopes to climb, sharp turns to make, and the road was also very bad. The low-lying areas on both sides were densely lined with a long row of workers' sheds. Even during the day, cars fell off the road here and had to be pulled up by tractors. Little Qu greeted the two trucks behind again: "It's very dangerous there!" "Okay, everyone be careful."
    A cluster of dense red fireballs appeared in front of them. They had arrived at the construction site!
    As soon as they heard the truck horn, a dark crowd of people gathered around. At this time, Little Qu noticed that his upper body and the driver's cab were covered with a layer of white frost. All the way, he felt like something was blocking his eyes, and only then did he realize that it was because his eyelashes were covered in frost.
    As soon as he got out of the truck, the construction site director grabbed his hand tightly and said:
      "You have worked hard!"
    "It's nothing. The drivers in the front are also driving in the dark at night!"

    夜雾
    本报记者  曹葆铭
    （一）
    晚上七点多钟，高个子的汽车组长曲元华刚从搅拌站运着一车混凝土出来，就碰上大雾了。白雾，像一团团浓烟随风扑来，马上又散开去。不多时刻，工地上就白茫茫的什么也看不清楚，沿途的路灯也成了一颗颗红火球。新筑的公路上的松土和冰雪，被川流不息的汽车群碾压了一天，成了许多烂泥坑。路很难走。
    “小曲，路上啥也看不清，我们要收车了。”沿途回搅拌站的空车上的司机，都向曲元华这样说。
    曲元华一听这话就有些着急。他很清楚，今天白天就起雾了。平日被人当做识别方向标志的热电站的大烟囱被遮没了。许多人都在这辽阔的武钢工地迷了路。但是，为了迎接武钢主厂房开工，厂区大道的跨线桥今天下午开始浇灌大梁了。混凝土运完了吗？不能影响跨线桥施工啊！他便向回站的空车喊道：
      “你们千万在站上等着我，不忙回家！”
    他的车子刚到工地，工地主任就迎上来了：“司机同志，这咋整呀？搅拌站打电话来说，司机同志们都不肯出车了。我们这座桥还差三车混凝土就可以把两根大梁筑成了。要是混凝土不运来，这大梁就得报废返工，损失四千多元。我们还得派人把这灌好的混凝土挖掉，才能重作！”
    曲元华从1955年起就在工地作汽车司机，懂得混凝土的特性：如果它的表面凝固了，再往上浇灌，新旧混凝土粘不在一块，就会形成裂缝，报废返工。这个青年团员考虑了一下，便说：“我回去动员他们来。要是他们不来，我搞一宿也要把这三车混凝土送来。”
    在回站的路上，曲元华直耽心大伙等不过，会把车放了水，回家去吃饭，那就没法治了。他于是一股劲儿地开着五排挡快车往回赶。
    谁知道事急偏偏阻碍多。他刚开到一个涵洞前面，就碰到一辆满载货物的汽车陷到泥坑里面，挡住了去路。经常跑这条道儿的司机们都很清楚，这个涵洞是这条路上最难走的地方。恨不得一下飞回站去的曲元华，见前面那辆车怎么也不能动弹，便推开车门喊道：“我替你拉出来！”“好呀，就是没铁绳。”“那我借去。”
    （二）
    这时候，搅拌站的调度室里也很紧张。调度员老李一再恳请司机们：“随便那三位同志再出一次车，就把问题解决了。”但司机们直嚷：“这样的天气，这样的路，车要掉到沟里，搞坏了，谁负得起这责任？”运输公司的调度员老马和工地副主任也赶来了，但是司机们还是坚决不出车。这天，工地上早就传开了一件事：下午，市里开出了一只轮渡，就因为在迷雾中看不清航道，在长江上徘徊了两个钟头都靠不了岸，最后派了一批熟悉航道的船家驾了好些小划子去，才将过江的乘客接上了岸。现时的雾比下午更大，又在黑夜。调度员老马是个老司机，很了解在这样的时刻出车是件冒险的事，全靠司机自觉自愿，不能强迫。但是，司机们不愿去，工地上却就差这么三车混凝土！他们把一线希望寄托在曲元华身上。
    曲元华的汽车喇叭响了。三个人连忙赶出门去，没等曲元华下车，就叫道：
      “小曲，这咋整呀？他们都不愿意去。”
      “那我一个人搞一宿也行。”
      “不要这样，小曲。一个人力量小，得叫他们也去。三个车一次就拉完了。”
      “他们三个人都没说通，我能行吗？”小曲心下有些迟疑。但他回转一想：“为了工作嘛，还能怕碰壁？”
    他随着三人跨进调度室去，见几个司机正围在炉子边上低着头抽烟烤火。他马上叫道：“这三车混凝土不运去，就损失四千多块呀！”但是大家抬起头来，互相望了望，又低下头去不说话。“哪个同志去拉一车？我自己拉两车就解决了。”仍然没有人吱声。
    小曲这时候才想到：这样的事情得抓党团员才行！
    但是，这几个人中没有一个党员。他马上找住二组的团员张金堂，他俩过去在一辆车上工作过。谁知这个团员说：“我胆小。路上一点看不清，我刚才还是开三挡慢车回来的。”小曲这下急了，便责备他说：“你得考虑考虑咱们的责任。这样的事情，不靠咱们党团员，靠谁去？”
    这话使张金堂惊了一下。但他反问道：“要掉到沟里了，咋整？”“我拉你起来。”张金堂又犹豫了一回，才说道：“好吧，我去一车。”
    小曲马上又找住一组的团员李尊三，他是一个转业军人。李尊三愁眉苦脸地回答说：“不行呀，我这车子力量小。爬陡坡的时候，挂一排挡都差点爬不上去。”“我的车子是新的，你要爬不上去，我来拖”。
    三个青年团员决定出车了！顿时乐得老李马上就挂电话通知搅拌台，一次拌出三车混凝土来。工地副主任也从兜里掏出笔记本来，边问边记他们三人的名字。小曲知道他想干啥，便将手一挥，说道：“算啦，你别记了，大家都是为了工作。”“不，不。这样克服困难，应该表扬。”
    （三）
    装完混凝土，车刚一上路，就发现天气更坏了。原先就变得像红火球的路灯，现在更黯淡了。把车前大灯一打开，灯光就被迷雾反射过来，白花花的一片，照的人眼花缭乱。猛烈的寒风从窗前灌进来，刺的人鼻子、眼睛发酸，脸上发痛。麻木的双手，也不能很灵活地掌握被霜雾弄的直打滑的方向盘了。这时候，小曲加倍用心地把住方向盘，两眼直瞪着前方，眨也不敢眨。
    车刚到那个最难走的涵洞前面，一个思想就在他脑子里闪过：要是三辆车都掉进泥坑里，咋办？他立刻闪了闪车尾的红灯，按了下喇叭，停下车来，向后边两个车招呼道：
    “让我先过。要是过去了，我就用手电往地下照，你们见了这样的信号就跟着过来。我要是陷进坑里了，就用手电两边乱摇幌，你们就不要来了。”
    说完，小曲将车挂上一排挡，探出车门去死死盯着两个前轮。车子鼓嘟嘟响了一阵，便向前一冲，两个轮子正好压在活动路面板的边缘上，小曲心里一乐：“唉呀，这下好了。”车过了涵洞，他又踏着烂泥走回去，用手电替后面两个车子照着路面板，边招呼，边后退，把这两个车引了过来。
    但是，前面还有一段很窄很窄的单行道，要上下陡坡，转急弯，路也很烂，两旁的低地里还密密地排着一长串工棚。在这里，白天也有汽车掉下道去，用拖拉机才拉起来。小曲又向后边两个车招呼道：“那里很危险呀！”“行呀，大家注意点。”
    一群密集的红火球出现在眼前，他们到达工地了！
    一听见汽车喇叭响，黑糊糊的一群人便围过来了。这时候，小曲才注意到自己的上身和司机台里都结了一层白霜。一路上，他老觉得两眼有什么东西遮住，这时候才发现是睫毛上结了霜的缘故。
    一下车，工地主任就紧紧拉住他的手说：
      “你们辛苦了！”
    “没什么。人家前方的司机还专门在夜里摸黑开车哩！”
