A Profile of Mollet

Guy Mollet, the French Prime Minister who resigned due to taking responsibility for a certain matter, is fifty-two years old. He joined the French Socialist Party in 1921. During World War II, he was drafted into the army and soon became a prisoner of war of the Hitler's forces. He was released in 1942. In September 1946, he became the General Secretary of the French Socialist Party, and in 1953, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Socialist Party. From December 1946 to July 1951, Mollet successively served as Minister of State in the Blum cabinet, Minister of State in the Pleven cabinet, and Deputy Speaker of the Parliament during the Queuille cabinet. On February 31, 1956, Mollet was ordered to form the twenty-first cabinet of France after the war, lasting fifteen months and twenty days until May 21, 1957.

After taking office, Mollet expressed his willingness to improve East-West relations and was invited to the Soviet Union for a friendly visit in May 1956. However, the Mollet government pursued a policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, conducting colonial wars, and intensifying extortion from the French people. Shortly after taking office, he expanded the dirty war in Algeria. In November 1956, the Mollet government, together with Britain and Israel, launched the war of aggression against Egypt, causing serious difficulties in domestic finance and economy. After the failure of the war of aggression against Egypt, the Mollet government did not learn its lesson and continued the colonial war against Algeria, and attempted to maintain military spending by increasing taxes and other so-called "thrift" measures. This policy further aroused the opposition of the broad masses of the French people, and eventually led to his resignation.

    摩勒其人
    引咎辞职的法国总理居伊·摩勒现年五十二岁。1921年参加法国社会党。第二次世界大战时，他被征入伍，不久便作了希特勒军队的俘虏，1942年获释。1946年9月担任法国社会党总书记，1953年又被选为社会党副主席。从1946年12月到1951年7月，摩勒曾先后任布鲁姆内阁的国务部长和普利文内阁的国务部长及葛义内阁期间的议会副议长。1956年2月31日，摩勒受命组成了战后法国的第二十一届内阁，到1957年5月21日为止，共历时十五个月零二十天。
    摩勒上台后，曾经表示愿意改善东西方关系，并曾于1956年5月应邀到苏联进行友好访问。但是，摩勒政府奉行扩军备战，进行殖民战争和加紧向法国人民勒索的政策。他上台后不久，便扩大了在阿尔及利亚的肮脏战争。1956年11月，摩勒政府又同英国和以色列发动了侵埃战争，使国内财政经济造成严重困难。侵埃战争失败后，摩勒政府并未接受教训，仍继续进行对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，并企图用增加赋税等所谓“节约”措施来维持军费，这个政策更加激起了法国广大人民的反对，而终于辞职。
