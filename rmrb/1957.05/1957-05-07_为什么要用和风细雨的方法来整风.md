The Party Central Committee recently decided to launch another widespread and in-depth rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism throughout the Party. This is yet another movement for self-education and self-reform for our Party. Through this rectification movement, the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of all our Party comrades will be further enhanced, so as to adapt to the current situation of China's tremendous development and undertake the new historical tasks facing our Party, thereby uniting the whole Party and the people of the whole country more closely, and achieving new and greater victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction.

It is precisely based on the nature and purpose of this movement that the Party Central Committee's instructions on rectification stipulate that this rectification movement should adopt the method of ideological education that is both serious and earnest and like a gentle breeze and mild rain, and the method of appropriate criticism and self-criticism. For those who are found to have made mistakes in the rectification movement, regardless of the size of the mistake, except for those who seriously violate laws and discipline, no organizational punishment will be given, and active and patient assistance should be given to achieve the purpose of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient."

Why should we adopt such a policy and method for rectification? There are two reasons for this. On the one hand, if our Party turns a blind eye to the unhealthy tendencies within the Party that have arisen in the new situation, namely, the bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist styles of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and does not rectify them in a timely and serious manner, it will not only be impossible to educate the Party members who have been infected with these styles, and impossible to rescue them from the quagmire of mistakes; but it will also seriously damage our Party's ties with the people, and make it impossible for our Party to effectively shoulder the arduous task of leading the people in building the country in the new historical period. This is naturally very dangerous for a working-class party that regards serving the people as its bounden duty. But on the other hand, if our Party, in order to rectify its style, one-sidedly emphasizes giving disciplinary punishments to all comrades who have made mistakes, or even replaces ideological education with disciplinary punishments, forming a punitive approach, this is also extremely dangerous for our Party.

Our Party is already the ruling party in the whole country. Whether we can correctly handle the mistakes within the Party is not only an internal Party issue, but also a major issue that will affect the life of the country. If we do not use the method of persuasion and education, but use the method of coercion to rectify the style within the Party and to treat Party members who have made mistakes, then the work will suffer losses. As everyone knows, during the period of feudal imperial rule, it was often the case that "a new emperor means a new court," and either the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevails over the East Wind. This is the inevitable result of the mutual struggle and exclusion among factions and groups with different interests within the reactionary class. Our Party is the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class. There are no and should be no mutually opposed factions and groups with different interests within the Party. Of course, we should not follow the path taken by the reactionary classes, but are fully capable of handling the mistakes within the Party according to correct principles.

For many years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, whether in the rectification movement or in the daily handling of Party errors, our Party has resolutely rejected the above-mentioned erroneous practices and adhered to the correct policy. This is to adopt a differentiated approach to Party errors, that is, to distinguish between different situations of Party errors and adopt different handling methods. For all counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the Party, class alien elements who insist on carrying out splitting activities within the Party, and other incorrigibly corrupt and degenerate elements, the Party has adopted a firm attitude to remove them from the Party. And for comrades who have made mistakes, as long as the mistakes they have made are of the nature of Party errors, as long as the mistakes they have made can still be corrected within the Party, and they themselves are willing to correct them, then the Party has resolutely implemented "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "both clarifying ideology and uniting comrades," emphasizing ideological education and not easily resorting to disciplinary action.

Why should our Party adopt such a principle in handling Party errors? This is because the contradiction between correct and incorrect opinions within the Party, under normal circumstances, belongs to the issue of right and wrong, which is a contradiction among the people and not an antagonistic contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. The purpose of our Party in handling Party errors is to prevent mistakes from being repeated as much as possible. In order to educate comrades who have made mistakes, and also to educate other comrades, so that everyone can learn from past mistakes, improve their ideological understanding, and no longer repeat the mistakes that have been made. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to adopt the principle of focusing on education, conduct realistic criticism of comrades who have made mistakes, conduct specific analysis of the causes of mistakes, and find ways and means to correct mistakes. Otherwise, new mistakes will be created. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "It is easy to severely punish comrades who have made mistakes, even to expel them from the Party. But if the ideological problem of why the mistakes were made is not solved, then severe punishment will not only not guarantee that the Party will not repeat the same mistakes, but will even cause greater mistakes."

When dealing with Party errors, we should certainly see that comrades who have made mistakes in their work have negative factors in their thinking, but at the same time, we must not ignore the fact that these comrades also have positive factors in their thinking, and we must never adopt an attitude of completely negating them. Pointing this out is very important for correctly handling contradictions among the people and handling Party errors. The vast majority of our Party comrades have the fine qualities of serving the people and have done a lot of useful work for the Party and the people; the reason why some of them have made mistakes in their work is mainly because there are still some erroneous things in their ideological understanding, especially because they are not good at consciously using the dialectics of the objective world to guide their thinking and guide their actions. Their motives are often good, but because their ideology and work methods are not right (the so-called not right means that they do not conform to the laws of motion of the objective world, that is, they violate materialist dialectics), they have ruined things and made mistakes. Therefore, after receiving appropriate criticism and education from the Party, they are generally willing and able to correct their mistakes. However, improving ideological understanding is a long process, and being willing to correct mistakes does not mean that mistakes will not be made again. This requires constant re-practice and re-education. Anyone can only gradually approach the truth in the comparison of right and wrong, success and failure; it is impossible for anyone not to make any mistakes. It is precisely from this situation that the Party, for Party members who have made mistakes, should not only promptly point out and deal with their mistakes, but more importantly, analyze the ideological roots of the mistakes, turn the mistakes into their opposites—the prescription for curing the mistakes, and enthusiastically and patiently help them correct the mistakes. As long as they are willing to correct their mistakes, there is generally no need to give organizational punishments, especially not to give excessively heavy organizational punishments. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of educating comrades to correct their mistakes and continuing to unite comrades to work together. Only in this way will the Party not weaken its unity because it has dealt with the mistakes of Party members, but will instead consolidate its unity. On the contrary, if we think that comrades who have made mistakes have nothing to offer, and completely deny their revolutionary aspirations and work achievements, "killing them with one blow," this will not only fail to educate comrades who have made mistakes to correct their mistakes; but will also arouse their dissatisfaction, and even seriously undermine the unity of the Party, making the Party organization stagnant and alienated.

Facts have proved that our Party's practice of emphasizing ideological education and not easily taking disciplinary action against comrades who have made mistakes is correct. Over the years, some comrades in our Party have made various mistakes, and only a few have been disciplined. However, because the Party's handling of them is realistic and proceeds from the desire to unite and educate comrades, in most cases, it has not only not dampened their enthusiasm, but has prompted them to quickly correct their mistakes and continue to work hard for the Party.

It should be explained that due to the nature of our Party and the tasks it undertakes, there needs to be a high degree of centralism and necessary strict discipline within the Party. But it is equally clear that centralism within the Party must be built on the basis of democracy, and Party discipline must be built on the basis of the conscious action of Party members. Therefore, whether in peacetime or in the rectification movement, leading the development of democracy, developing criticism and self-criticism, and advocating the use of gentle and persuasive educational methods to solve ideological problems within the Party will not only not hinder but will strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership, and will not only not weaken but will strengthen the Party's discipline. Of course, it is entirely appropriate to give necessary disciplinary action to a very small number of Party members who have made serious mistakes due to violating laws and discipline. But the purpose of doing so is not simply to punish them, but to help them better understand and correct their mistakes. As long as the handling of them is correct, their mistakes have not been exaggerated, and their punishments have not been increased, they will also be willing to accept them and will strive to correct their mistakes. This is fundamentally different from the punitive approach.

The Party Central Committee's handling of comrades who have made mistakes of the "Left" opportunist line has set a good example for us to correctly treat Party errors, which everyone is familiar with. Since the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, our Party has established a correct policy for dealing with Party errors. In the more than twenty years since then, it has been continuously supplemented with new experiences. In particular, the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the recent instructions of the Central Committee on the rectification movement have made further and more perfect provisions on this policy, emphasizing the necessity and importance of focusing on education in handling Party errors. However, this does not mean that every Party organization in the past has correctly implemented this policy of the Party. In addition to the fact that some Party organizations have liberalist sentiments of appeasement and connivance towards Party members who have made mistakes, especially Party members who hold leading positions and have made mistakes, what is more worthy of attention is that some Party organizations often give too many and too heavy punishments to Party members who have made mistakes. This is mainly manifested in: First, not strictly distinguishing the nature of the mistakes, treating general mistakes as major mistakes in principle, and treating mistakes in ideological style as mistakes in political stand. Second, exaggerating the circumstances and degree of the mistakes, describing minor mistakes as serious mistakes, describing individual and local mistakes as systematic and comprehensive mistakes, and describing occasional mistakes as consistent mistakes. In this way, some Party organizations have increased the punishments for comrades who have made mistakes, and even punished those who should not have been punished, and expelled those who should not have been expelled from the Party. The occurrence of these phenomena is partly due to the Party organizations' lack of deep understanding of the Party's policy of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient," and their sectarian and punitive sentiments; but many are also due to the Party organizations' failure to strictly follow the Party Constitution, their failure to respect the democratic rights of Party members, and their mistakes in the facts of the mistakes made by Party members.

The rectification movement is a movement of criticism and self-criticism to raise ideological awareness, and it is especially necessary to focus on relying on the method of education and persuasion, and especially to limit the use of organizational punishment methods. Therefore, in its instructions on the rectification movement, the Central Committee stipulates that only a small number of forums and group meetings should be held, or the method of individual heart-to-heart talks between comrades should be adopted. Everyone should humbly listen to the opinions of others and actively give opinions to others, but should not force the criticized to accept criticisms they do not agree with. For some principled disputes, necessary conclusions should be made when possible, but different opinions must be allowed to be reserved. All this is the content of the so-called gentle breeze and mild rain method. Only by adopting such a method of rectification can comrades open up their minds without any worries, calmly analyze problems, conduct full reasoning and careful criticism, and truly persuade people with reason, rather than with power. On the contrary, if the method of criticism meetings or struggle meetings is adopted, if it is permissible to force the criticized to accept criticisms they do not agree with, then even if the purpose and motivation of the critic are good, they often cannot fully and clearly explain the truth, and it is very easy to produce excessive actions, even violating the principle of raising awareness and curing the sickness to save the patient. For those who are found in the rectification to have made mistakes in violating laws and discipline and need to be given organizational punishment, they should also be handled cautiously in accordance with the Party Constitution. That is, to thoroughly investigate and research and check with the person who made the mistake to thoroughly clarify the causes and specific circumstances of the mistake; to listen to the opinions of the person who made the mistake at the group meeting or branch meeting, and allow him to defend his mistakes; to make an appropriate conclusion and punishment decision based on the facts of the mistakes he made, and report it to a certain leading authority for approval. If the person who made the mistake has different opinions on the conclusion and punishment, he should be allowed to file an appeal and should not treat it as a manifestation of dishonesty, thereby increasing his punishment.

Giving warm care and sincere help to comrades who have made mistakes is an essential aspect of implementing the Party's principle of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient." It will make comrades who have made mistakes feel the warmth of the Party, thereby working harder to overcome their mistakes and better serve the Party and the people. In the past, many Party organizations did this, thereby helping comrades who had made mistakes to quickly correct their mistakes. In this rectification movement, we should do this even more. For comrades who have made mistakes, whether or not they have been given organizational punishment, they should be given active and patient help, trusted politically, and helped in their work, so that they can correct their mistakes as soon as possible and make achievements. In the past, some Party organizations treated comrades who had made mistakes with cold eyes, even discriminated against and attacked them, or adopted a passive wait-and-see attitude towards them, failing to actively help them dispel their doubts. All these are wrong and should be resolutely avoided in this rectification movement.

Over a long period in the past, our Party has established a completely correct policy in rectifying the style within the Party and treating Party errors, and has accumulated rich experience in this regard. In this rectification movement, we must cherish the Party's experience in this area, fully develop it, and enrich it with new and better experiences. As long as we adopt this correct attitude, we will surely be able to constantly correct the Party's style, constantly correct mistakes, always maintain and strengthen the unity of the whole Party, and smoothly complete the new tasks facing our Party in the new historical period—learning to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

### 为什么要用和风细雨的方法来整风

    为什么要用和风细雨的方法来整风
    我们的党中央最近决定在全党重新进行一次普遍的深入的反对官僚主义、反对宗派主义、反对主观主义的整风运动，这是我们党又一次进行自我教育和自我改造的运动。通过这次整风运动，我们全党同志的马克思列宁主义的思想水平将得到进一步的提高，以便能够适应当前我国巨大发展的形势，承当我们的党所面临的新的历史任务，从而把全党和全国人民更加紧密地团结在一起，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中取得新的更加伟大的胜利。
    正是基于运动的这种性质和目的，所以党中央关于整风的指示中规定：这次整风运动应当采取既严肃认真又和风细雨的思想教育方法，恰如其分的批评和自我批评的方法；对于在整风运动中检查出来犯了错误的人，不论错误大小，除严重违法乱纪者外，一概不给以组织上的处分，并且要给以积极的、耐心的帮助，这样来达到“惩前毖后，治病救人”的目的。
    为什么要采取这样的方针和方法来整风呢？这有两方面的原因。一方面，如果我们党对于在新的形势下产生的党内不良作风，也就是脱离群众和脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的作风熟视无睹，不及时地、严肃认真地加以整顿，这就不但不可能使沾染了这些作风的党员受到教育，不可能把他们从错误的泥坑中挽救出来；而且会严重地损害我们党同人民群众的联系，会使我们党不可能在新的历史时期中有效地担负起领导人民建设国家的艰巨任务。这对于一个以服务于人民为自己的天职的工人阶级政党来说，自然是非常危险的。但是另一方面，如果我们的党为要整顿自己的作风，就片面地强调给予所有犯错误的同志以纪律处分，甚至用纪律处分代替了思想教育，形成了惩办主义，这对于我们党也是极其危险的。
    我们的党已经是全国范围的执政党，我们能不能正确地处理党内的错误，这不仅仅是党内的问题，而且是会影响国家生活的重大问题。如果我们不是用说服教育的方法，而是用压服的方法来整顿党内的作风，来对待犯了错误的党员，那就会使工作遭受损失。大家知道，在封建帝王统治的时期，经常是所谓一朝天子一朝臣，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，这是反动阶级内部利害不同的派别、集团互相倾轧和排斥所必然造成的结果。我们党是工人阶级的马克思列宁主义的政党，党内没有也不容许有利害不同的互相对立的派别和集团，当然不应该走反动阶级所走过的道路，而完全有可能按照正确的原则来处理党内的错误。
    许多年来，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的领导之下，不论是在整风运动中或者在日常处理党内错误中，我们的党都坚决地排斥了上述的错误的做法，而坚持了正确的方针。这就是在对待党内错误上采取分别对待的方针，也就是区别党内错误的不同情况，采取不同的处理方法。对于凡属混进党内的反革命分子，在党内坚持进行分裂活动的阶级异己分子和其他不可救药的腐化堕落分子，党都采取了坚决的态度把他们清除出党。而对于犯了错误的同志，只要他所犯的错误属于党内错误的性质，只要他所犯的错误还可以留在党内改正，并且本人也愿意改正的话，那末，党都坚决地执行了“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”的原则，着重思想的教育，而不轻易采取纪律处分。
    为什么我们党对于党内错误要采取这样的处理原则呢？这是因为党内的正确意见和错误意见的矛盾，在一般情况下属于通常所说的是非问题，是人民内部矛盾而不是敌我之间的对抗性的矛盾。我们党处理党内错误的目的，是要尽可能使错误不至重犯。为了教育犯错误的同志，也为了教育其他的同志，使大家都从过去的错误中吸取教训，提高思想认识水平，不再重复已经犯过的错误。而要达到这样的目的，就必须采取以教育为主的原则，对于犯错误的同志进行实事求是的批评，对于犯错误的原因进行具体的分析，并且找出改正错误的方法和途径。否则，就会造成新的错误。刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上所做的政治报告中说道：“对于犯错误的同志给以严厉的处罚，以至把他们驱逐出党，这是很容易的。但是如果没有解决为什么造成错误的思想问题，那末，严厉的处罚不但不能保证党不再重犯同样的错误，甚至还会造成更大的错误。”
    我们在处理党内错误的时候，固然应该看到在工作中犯了错误的同志在思想上有消极的因素，但同时不能忽视这样的同志在思想上也还有积极的因素，绝不应当采取一概抹杀的态度。指出这一点，对于正确地处理人民内部的矛盾和处理党内错误都是很重要的。我们党的绝大多数同志都具有为人民服务的优良品质，为党和为人民作了许多有益的工作；他们中间的一些人所以在工作中犯了错误，主要是由于他们的思想认识上还有一部分错误的东西，特别是由于他们还不善于把客观世界的辩证法自觉地用来指导自己的思想，指导自己的行动。他们的动机往往是好的，只是由于思想方法和工作方法不对头（所谓不对头，就是同客观世界的运动规律不符合，就是违反了唯物辩证法），才把事情办坏了，发生了错误。因此，在受到党的适当的批评和教育以后，他们一般地是愿意改正、也能够改正错误的。但是思想认识的提高是一个长时间的过程，愿意改正错误不等于不再犯错误。这就需要不断的再实践，再教育。任何人也只能在正确和错误、成功和失败的比较中逐步地接近真理，不犯任何错误的人是不可能有的。正是从这样的情况出发，党对于犯了错误的党员，不仅要及时地指出和处理他们的错误，更重要的还是要分析错误的思想根源，使错误变为它的对立物——医治错误的药方，并且热情地、耐心地帮助他们改正错误。只要他们愿意改正错误，一般就不需要给予组织处分，尤其不应该给以过重的组织处分。只有这样，才能达到教育同志改正错误并且继续团结同志在一起工作的目的。只有这样，才不会因为党处理了党员的错误而削弱了党的团结，反而会更加巩固党的团结。反之，如果以为犯错误的同志一无可取，对他们的革命愿望和工作成就一笔抹杀，“一棍子打死”，这就不但不能教育犯错误的同志改正错误；而且会引起他们的不满，甚至严重地破坏党的团结，使党的组织处于死气沉沉、离心离德的状态。
    事实证明，我们党对犯错误的同志着重思想的教育，而不轻易采取纪律处分的做法，是正确的。历年来，我们党内有一部分同志犯了各种各样的错误，其中只有少数人受到纪律处分。但是由于党对他们的处理是实事求是的，是从团结和教育同志的愿望出发的，因而在大多数情况下，不仅没有打击了他们的积极性，反而促使他们迅速地改正错误，继续为党努力工作。
    应当说明，由于我们党的性质和它所担负的任务，党内是需要有高度的集中，需要有必要的严格的纪律的。但同样清楚的是，党内的集中必须建立在民主的基础之上，党的纪律必须建立在党员自觉的基础之上。因此，不论在平时或者在整风运动中，有领导地发扬民主，发展批评和自我批评，提倡用和风细雨的说服教育的方法来解决党内的思想问题，这不但不会妨害而且会加强党的集中统一的领导，不但不会削弱而且会加强党的纪律。当然，对于极少数由于违法乱纪而犯了严重错误的党员，给他们以必要的纪律处分，这是完全应当的。但是这样作的目的，也不是单纯地为了惩罚他们，而是为了帮助他们更好地认识和改正错误。只要对他们的处理是正确的，没有夸大了他们的错误，没有加重对他们的处分，他们也会愿意接受，并且会努力改正错误。这就和惩办主义有原则上的不同。
    党中央对于犯过左倾机会主义路线错误的同志的处理，就为我们正确地对待党内错误树立了一个良好的典范，这是大家都熟悉的。我们党从1935年1月遵义会议以后，就确立了对待党内错误的正确方针。在这以后的二十多年间，又不断地用新的经验加以补充。特别是党的第八次全国代表大会和最近中央关于整风运动的指示，又对这个方针作了进一步的和更加完善的规定，强调地说明了处理党内错误以教育为主的必要性和重要性。但是，这并不等于说过去每个党的组织都正确地执行了党的这个方针。除了一些党的组织对于犯错误的党员、特别是对于担负领导职务的犯错误的党员有姑息迁就的自由主义情绪以外，更加值得注意的是部分党的组织，往往对于犯错误的党员处分过多和过重。这主要表现在：第一，不严格区别错误的性质，把一般性的错误当成原则性的重大错误，把思想作风上的错误当成政治立场上的错误。第二，夸大了犯错误的情节和程度，把不严重的错误说成严重的错误，把个别的和局部的错误说成系统的全面的错误，把偶然的错误说成一贯的错误。这样，有些党组织就加重了对犯错误同志的处分，甚至不该处分的也处分了，不该开除党籍的也开除了。这些现象的发生，有的是由于党组织对党的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针缺乏深刻的了解，有宗派主义和惩办主义的情绪；但也有许多是由于党组织不严格按照党章办事，不尊重党员的民主权利，弄错了党员所犯错误的事实而造成的。
    整风运动是一个提高思想觉悟的批评和自我批评的运动，尤其需要着重依靠教育说服的方法，尤其需要限制使用组织处分的方法。因此，中央在关于整风运动的指示中，规定只开人数不多的座谈会和小组会，或者采取同志间个别谈心的方式。每个人都应该虚心地听取别人的意见，积极地向别人提意见，但是不得强迫被批评者接受他所不同意的批评。对于一些带原则性的争论，可能的时候应该作出必要的结论，但是必须容许保留不同的意见。这一切，也就是所谓和风细雨的方法的内容。只有采取这样的方式方法来整风，才能使同志们毫无顾虑地敞开思想，冷静地分析问题，进行充分的说理和细致的批判，真正作到以理服人，而不是以势压人。反之，如果采取批评大会或者斗争大会的方式，如果许可强迫被批评者接受他所不同意的批评，那末，即令批评者的目的和动机是好的，也常常不能把道理说得很充分、很清楚，并且非常容易产生过火的行动，以至违反提高觉悟、治病救人的原则。对于在整风中检查出来犯了违法乱纪错误、需要给以组织处分的人，也应该按照党章慎重地加以处理。这就是要通过深入的调查研究并且同犯错误的本人进行核对，切实弄清发生错误的原因和具体情节；要在小组会或者支部大会上听取犯错误的本人的意见，容许他对自己的错误进行辩护；要根据他所犯错误的事实，对他作出恰如其分的结论和处分决定，并且报经一定的领导机关批准。如果犯错误的本人对结论和处分有不同意见，应该容许他提出申诉，不应该把它当做不老实的表现，因而加重对他的处分。
    给予犯错误的同志热情的关怀和诚恳的帮助，这是贯彻党的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的原则的一个重要方面，它会使犯错误的同志感到党的温暖，从而更加努力克服自己的错误，更好地为党为人民工作。过去，许多党的组织是这样作的，因而帮助了犯错误的同志迅速改正错误。在这次整风运动中，更应当这样作。对于犯了错误的同志，不论他们是否受到组织上的处分，都应给以积极的、耐心的帮助，在政治上信任他们，在工作上帮助他们，使他们能够尽快地改正错误，作出成绩。过去，有些党的组织对犯错误的同志冷眼相待，甚至加以歧视和打击，或者对他们采取消极旁观的态度，不积极地帮助他们解除疑虑。所有这些都是错误的，在这次整风运动中应当坚决避免。
    在过去一个长时期中，我们党在整顿党内的作风、对待党内的错误上，已经确立了一条完全正确的方针，在这方面积累了丰富的经验。在这次整风运动中，我们要十分珍视党在这方面的经验，充分地发扬它，并且用新的更好的经验来丰富它。只要采取这种正确的态度，我们就一定能够不断地端正党的作风，不断地修正错误，经常保持和加强全党的团结，顺利地完成我们党在新的历史时期所面临的新的任务——学会正确地处理人民内部的矛盾。
