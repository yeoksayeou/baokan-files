    Re-emphasizing the Issue of Economical Land Use in Basic Construction
    Regarding the issue of economical land use in basic construction, we published an editorial on March 31st. Recently, some units have begun to inspect the phenomenon of land waste in construction, or have returned the excess land occupied to farmers for cultivation. This is necessary and correct. However, there are still many construction units that have not carried out this work. Moreover, some new construction units are still enclosing large amounts of farmland from farmers, requisitioning more than they use, or requisitioning and not using at all, forming a serious waste of land.
    According to the recent inspection by comrades from the Second Ministry of Machine Building, if the land use for construction of the ministry in the Xi'an area is calculated according to the original design, about half of it is wasted. Now they have saved 269 hectares from the land already requisitioned and purchased, returning it to farmers for cultivation, and are preparing to continue to return land that can be saved. We believe that this inspection by the Second Ministry of Machine Building is not overly strict. Moreover, the construction land of the ministry in the Xi'an area accounts for only 18% of the total construction land in the area. It is conceivable that the phenomenon of wasting construction land in other construction departments, including industrial and mining enterprises, education, public services, culture, commerce, and other departments, is also very serious. Sichuan Province recently inspected the land use of fourteen construction units and found the same problem. These units requisitioned a total of 4,486 mu of land, of which 46% was occupied without the approval of the local government, and another 37% was requisitioned but not used, left to lie barren. The 788 Factory requisitioned 182.3 mu of farmland from farmers, and because of delayed construction, all of it was left barren. The Longchang Natural Gas Mine requisitioned 336.3 mu of farmland from farmers, but only used 4%, with the rest left barren. Not only industrial and mining enterprises are like this, but construction units in other departments also have similar problems. For example, the Chengdu Central Meteorological Observatory requisitioned 110.36 mu of construction land, but it was abandoned because construction was not carried out; in the construction land requisitioned by the Petroleum Company, more than 85% was not utilized and left barren.
    The waste phenomenon is also very serious in the construction land that has already been occupied. In Xi'an, the distances between factories, and between factories and residential areas, are generally too far. The land occupied by factory buildings generally accounts for only one-fifth, and the rest are green belts and so-called reserved "room for development." Some factories have reserved not only room for short-term development, but also room for long-term development; not only the entire factory has reserved room for development, but also many workshops have reserved room for development. Therefore, not only are factories spaced very far apart, but workshops are also spaced very far apart. In the construction of schools, a lot of land has also been wasted. For example, a specialized school in Chongqing with only 1,000 students occupied more than 240 mu of land. In terms of residential construction land, according to the quota adopted in the Xi'an urban vision plan, the average construction area per person reaches 9 square meters, and the average land use area per person reaches 76 square meters, of which the green area reaches 15 square meters. Such construction land standards, in a country like ours with little arable land and a large population, are not appropriate now, and will not be appropriate in the future.
    Of course, in order to realize socialist industrialization and carry out basic construction, it is necessary to requisition some farmland from farmers. As long as the construction units use the land reasonably, the farmers support and actively support it. However, if they requisition more than they use, requisition early and use late, requisition and not use, and leave the land barren, then that is completely wrong and unforgivable by everyone. Because construction land is generally in the suburbs and plains, and the land in these areas is mostly fertile farmland that is "worth its weight in gold." Wasting construction land not only makes it difficult for some farmers who rely on land for a living in terms of production and life, but also reduces the source of food and clothing for the Chinese people. This is a major event related to the lives of thousands of masses, which must be taken seriously and properly handled. That is to say, it is necessary to eradicate any phenomenon of wasting land in construction.
    As for forcibly seizing farmland from farmers in construction, or using deceptive means to seize farmland from farmers, that is even more wrong and illegal behavior. For example, some construction units forcibly occupy construction land without the approval of the local government or the consent of the farmers; some construction units, in the name of allowing farmers to accumulate manure, fraudulently occupy farmers' farmland, but after occupying it, they do not allow farmers to use the accumulated manure; some construction units even threaten and beat farmers in order to seize land. The farmers angrily said: "The land is like tofu, and you are like kitchen knives, cutting wherever you want!" It can be seen to what extent the staff of individual units have gone in the matter of construction land! These units, as criticized in the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, have been infected with the Kuomintang style of the old society, forming a kind of privilege mentality, and treating the masses with the method of attacking and oppressing them. In this way, it should of course arouse the legitimate opposition of the farmers.
    It can be seen that the waste of construction land, from an economic point of view, not only wastes a large amount of arable land, affects agricultural production, and makes it difficult for some farmers in terms of production and life; but also increases the investment in sewers, roads, and other public utilities inside and outside the factory, inside and outside the school, and in the city, increases the cost of future production and management, and brings various inconveniences to the production and life of urban residents. From a political point of view, it causes particularly serious losses, causing dissatisfaction among farmers with the government, and expanding contradictions among the people.
    In order to thoroughly correct the phenomenon of wasting land in construction, and to correctly resolve the contradiction between farmers and construction units in construction land, it is necessary to strengthen the education of economical land use among all construction cadres, and criticize all kinds of phenomena of wasting land and ideological styles that are divorced from the masses. Whether in urban planning, architectural design, or construction land management, we must cherish every inch of land. We must improve urban planning based on the actual situation of our country with little land and a large population, rationally arrange the layout of buildings, appropriately increase building density, and appropriately compress the use of land for greening, flower beds, roads, and squares. The various construction land quotas stipulated by the relevant central units in the past should be revised or even abolished immediately.
    The land that has been over-occupied and occupied but not used by various construction units must be immediately returned to farmers for cultivation; the reserved "room for development" that can be transferred to farmers should also be returned to farmers for use; land occupied without the approval of the local government should be withdrawn and handled by the local government; illegally seizing farmers' land is a serious illegal act and should be punished by law.
    In view of the fact that the urban planning drafts currently prepared by various cities generally have the shortcomings of being too large in scale and too high in standards, they must first be revised before new basic construction land can be allocated. Before the new urban plan is finalized, if some construction units urgently need land, the local people's committee can allocate it from the existing vacant construction land. However, these land-using units must formulate specific land-use plans according to actual needs, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and submit them to the local people's committee for review along with the approval documents from relevant superiors. When submitting land-use plans, construction units must, in accordance with the principle of economy, requisition as much as is needed, and never requisition land that can be used or not used; do not requisition land that will not be constructed temporarily; and requisition land in stages and batches for construction in stages and batches. The farmers whose land is requisitioned should be given full explanations and persuasion, and proper arrangements should be made for their lives and work. Only in this way can we eliminate all kinds of waste in land use in our construction undertakings, save national construction investment, and resolve the contradictions between construction units and farmers, so that the construction undertakings can obtain the active support of the broad masses of farmers.

### 再论基本建设中节约用地的问题

    再论基本建设中节约用地的问题
    关于在基本建设中节约用地的问题，我们在3月31日已经发表过一篇社论。近来，有些单位，已经开始检查建设中浪费土地的现象，或者已经把多占的土地退还给农民耕种。这是必要的和正确的。但是，现在还有不少的建设单位，还没有进行这项工作。而且有些新的建设单位，还在大量圈用农民的耕地，多征少用，征而不用，形成严重地浪费土地的现象。
    根据第二机械工业部的同志们最近的检查，该部在西安地区的建设用地，如果按原定设计计算，约有一半是浪费的。现在他们从已经征购的土地中节约出二百六十九公顷，退还给农民耕种，并且准备继续退还那些可以节约的土地。第二机械工业部的这种检查，我们认为并不是过严的。而且该部在西安地区的建设用地，仅占该地区全部建设用地的18％。可以想见，其它建设部门，包括工矿企业、教育、事业、文化、商业等部门在内，浪费建设用地的现象，也是很严重的。四川省最近检查了十四个建设单位用地的情况，发现了同样的问题。这些单位共征购土地四千四百八十六亩，其中，未经当地政府审批，擅自占用的即达46％；征而不用，任其荒芜的又达37％。七八八厂征购农民耕地一百八十二点三亩，因推迟建设，全部荒芜。隆昌天然气矿征购农民耕地三百三十六点三亩，只用4％，其余全部荒芜。不仅工矿企业是如此，其它部门的建设单位，也有类似的问题。如成都中心气象台征购的建设用地一百一十点三六亩，因为没有进行建设而荒废；石油公司征购的建设用地中，也有85％以上没有利用，任其荒芜。
    在已经占用的建设用地中，浪费现象也很严重。在西安工厂同工厂之间的距离，工厂同住宅区之间的距离，一般失之过远。厂区建筑物所占的土地，一般只有五分之一，其它都是绿化地带和所谓预留“发展余地”。有些工厂不仅预留了近期发展余地，而且预留了远期发展余地；不仅整个工厂预留了发展余地，而且许多车间也预留了发展余地。所以，不但工厂同工厂之间摆得很稀，而且车间同车间之间也摆得很稀。在学校的建设中，也浪费了很多土地。例如重庆的一个专科学校，学生只有一千人，就占用了二百四十多亩土地。在住宅建设用地方面，按照西安城市远景规划采用的定额，每人的建筑面积平均达九平方公尺，每人用地面积平均达七十六平方公尺，其中绿化面积即达十五平方公尺。这样的建设用地标准，在我国这样一个耕地很少、人口很多的国家，不仅现在是不适当的，就是在将来也是不适当的。
    当然，为了实现社会主义工业化，为了进行基本建设，必须征购农民的一部分耕地。只要建设单位合理地使用土地，农民是拥护的和积极支持的。但是，如果多征少用，早征迟用，征而不用，荒芜土地，那就是完全错误的和人人所不能原谅的了。因为建设用地一般都在城市郊区和平原地区，而这些地区的土地，又多是“寸土称金”的肥沃耕地。浪费建设用地，不仅使一些依靠土地为生的农民，在生产上和生活上发生困难，而且将缩小我国人民的衣食之源。这是一个关系着千千万万群众生活的大事，必须认真地加以妥善处理。这就是说，必须根绝在建设中任何浪费土地的现象。
    至于在建设中强征强占农民的耕地，或者以欺骗的手段夺取农民的耕地，那更是错误的和违法的行为了。例如，有的建设单位，不经当地政府批准，不经农民同意，强占建设用地；有的建设单位，以让农民积肥为名，骗占农民的耕地，但占用之后，又不许农民使用积肥；有的建设单位，为了抢占土地，甚至威吓和殴打农民。农民气愤地说：“土地像豆腐，你们像菜刀，想切哪块，就切哪块！”可见，个别单位的工作人员，在建设用地问题上，已经走到何种脱离群众的地步！这些单位，正如党中央关于整风运动的指示中所批评的那样：他们沾染了旧社会的国民党的作风，形成一种特权思想，以打击压迫的方法对待群众。这样，当然应该引起农民的正当的反对。
    由此可见，在建设用地上的浪费，从经济上说，既荒芜大量耕地，影响农业减产，并使一些农民在生产上和生活上发生困难；又增加厂内厂外、校内校外上下水道、道路以及城市其它公用事业的投资，增加将来生产和管理的费用，并且给城市居民的生产和生活带来种种不便。而从政治上说，尤其造成严重损失，引起农民对政府的不满，扩大了人民内部的矛盾。
    为了彻底纠正在建设中浪费土地的现象，并正确解决在建设用地方面农民和建设单位之间的矛盾，必须在全体建设干部中加强节约用地的教育，批判各种各样的浪费土地的现象和脱离群众的思想作风。无论在城市规划、建筑设计和建筑用地管理等方面，都要珍惜每一寸土地。必须根据我国地少人多的实际情况，改善城市规划，合理地安排建筑物的布置，适当地提高建筑密度，适当地压缩绿化、花圃、道路、广场的用地。过去中央有关单位所规定的各种建筑用地定额，应该立即加以修改，甚至取消。
    各建设单位多占的和占而不用的土地，必须立即退还农民耕种；预留的“发展余地”，凡能转交农民使用的，也应该一律退还给农民使用；未经当地政府批准擅自占用的土地，应该一律退出，由当地政府处理；非法强占农民土地是严重的违法行为，应该受到法律的制裁。
    鉴于目前各城市所拟的城市规划草案普遍存在规模过大和标准过高的缺点，因此，必须首先加以修订，才好再拨新的基本建设用地。在新的城市规划未定之前，某些建设单位如果急需用地，可以由当地人民委员会在现有的建筑空地中拨出。但是这些用地单位必须按照实际需要，分别轻重缓急，拟定具体的用地计划，连同有关上级的批准文件，送交当地人民委员会审核。建设单位在提出用地计划的时候，必须根据节约的原则，用多少征多少，可用可不用的决不征用；暂时不施工的，就不要征用；分期分批施工的，就分期分批征用。对于被征用土地的农民，要进行充分的解释说服工作，并且在生活和工作上给以妥善的安置。只有这样，在我们的建设事业中，才能杜绝用地上的种种浪费，节约国家建设投资；而且才能解决建设单位同农民之间的矛盾，从而使建设事业获得广大农民群众的积极支持。
