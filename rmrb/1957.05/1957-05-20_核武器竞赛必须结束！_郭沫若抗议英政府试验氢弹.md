Xinhua News Agency, 19th – Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, issued a statement today protesting the British government's hydrogen bomb explosion test. The full text is as follows:

    The British government, disregarding the resolute opposition of peace-loving people around the world, has flagrantly conducted a hydrogen bomb explosion test in the Central Pacific. This tyrannical act has aroused the anger and strong protest of the Chinese people.

    The intensification of the nuclear arms race and the continuation of hydrogen bomb tests increasingly and seriously threaten world peace and human security. The impact will be detrimental to future generations. However, the governments of the United States and Britain stubbornly rejected all the suggestions of the Soviet government regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The US government has consistently violated the wishes of people of all countries and is still trying to pursue a dangerous policy of expanding its atomic military preparations, expanding atomic bases in the East and the West. Recently, it has blatantly deployed its missile forces to Taiwan, our territory, to intensify tensions and endanger peace in Asia and the world. This is intolerable to the Chinese people and the people of all countries.

    The Chinese people fully support the heroic struggle of the people of all countries, especially the Japanese people who have suffered from atomic bomb disasters, against atomic and hydrogen bombs. We are pleased to see that the movement to ban nuclear weapons and stop hydrogen bomb tests is rising higher and higher around the world. We believe that as long as all good and peace-loving people in the world strengthen unity and cooperation in the common goal of opposing war and defending peace, and make unremitting efforts in the struggle against atomic war and nuclear weapons testing, the powerful forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war.

    Hydrogen bomb tests must be stopped immediately!
    The nuclear arms race must end!

    核武器竞赛必须结束！
    郭沫若抗议英政府试验氢弹
    新华社19日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若今天发表谈话抗议英国政府进行氢弹爆炸试验。全文如下：
    英国政府不顾全世界爱好和平人民大声疾呼的坚决反对，悍然在中太平洋进行了氢弹爆炸试验，这一横暴行为激起了中国人民的愤怒和强烈抗议。
    核武器竞赛的加紧和氢弹试验的继续，愈来愈严重地威胁着世界和平与人类安全，其影响所及，并将为害于人类后代。但美、英两国政府顽固地拒绝了苏联政府关于停止试验核武器的一切建议。美国政府更始终违背世界各国人民的愿望，还在竭力推行扩张原子军备的危险政策，在东西方扩建原子基地，最近又公然把它的导弹部队派驻我国领土台湾，以加剧紧张局势和危害亚洲和世界和平。这是中国人民和世界各国人民所决不能容忍的。
    中国人民完全支持世界各国人民，特别是身受原子弹灾害的日本人民反原子弹、氢弹的英勇斗争。我们高兴地看到，在世界各地，要求禁止核武器和停止试验氢弹的运动越来越高涨。我们相信，只要世界各国一切善良的和平人们在反对战争、保卫和平的共同目标下，在反对原子战争、反对核武器试验的斗争中加强团结合作，进行不懈的努力，强大的和平力量是一定能够战胜好战势力的。
    氢弹试验必须立即中止！
    核武器竞赛必须结束！
