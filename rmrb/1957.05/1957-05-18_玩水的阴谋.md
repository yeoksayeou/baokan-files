A while ago, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its Coast and Geodetic Survey would send a team to Ethiopia to survey the Blue Nile River basin. It is said that this is to develop the Blue Nile River basin and "benefit" Ethiopia.

The United States is clearly becoming more and more interested in the Nile River. In October 1956, while Dulles refused to help Egypt build the Aswan High Dam, he declared to the United Nations Security Council that the United States was "prepared, at an appropriate time and at the request of the riparian states, to consider what steps could be taken to use the water resources of the Nile River more effectively for the benefit of the people of the region." In early January of this year, the Washington Evening Star revealed that the U.S. government was brewing "a large-scale plan to develop the Nile River" and included this plan in the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for carrying out aggression and expansion in the Near and Middle East. During his visits to African countries in February and March of this year, Nixon held key negotiations with the authorities of Uganda and Ethiopia on the issue of "developing" the Nile River. In his report after returning home, he specifically talked about the importance of "developing" the Nile River and suggested that the authorities "support collective efforts to develop rivers that are in the common interest of all relevant countries when the political situation permits."

The United States is so interested in "developing" the Nile River, supposedly because it very much hopes to "benefit" the riparian countries. However, the "New York Times" on April 2 did not say these words for no reason: "The Blue Nile River, which supplies 84% of the water to the Lower Nile (referring to the section of the Nile River within Egypt), originates in Ethiopia. This greatly increases Ethiopia's strategic importance."

What aspect of Ethiopia's "strategic importance" is the United States looking at?

The Nile River is one of the largest rivers in the world, with a drainage area of 2,867,000 square kilometers. It has two main tributaries. One is the White Nile River, which originates in Lake Victoria in Uganda. The other is the Blue Nile River, which originates in Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The White Nile and the Blue Nile converge in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, to become the mainstream of the Nile River, flowing north through Egypt into the Mediterranean Sea. And four-fifths of the water source of this section of the Nile River within Egypt comes from the Blue Nile River.

The Nile River is the mother of the Egyptian people and the "lifeline" of the Egyptian people. Of Egypt's nearly one million square kilometers of land area, only about 3.1% is arable land. Two-thirds of this arable land is in the Nile River Delta. More than 23 million Egyptian people are concentrated in a narrow, fertile strip along the Nile River basin. The population density there is about 1,600 people per square mile, which is one of the highest population densities in the world. Egypt has very little annual rainfall, and farming depends entirely on the water of the Nile River. Egypt's main crop, cotton, is even more closely related to the rise and fall of the Nile River. Egypt needs more water to expand its arable land. However, Egypt is downstream of the Nile River, and the water source is not within its own territory.

Therefore, the so-called "strategic importance" of Ethiopia is that as long as the water source of the Blue Nile River originating in Ethiopia is controlled, Egypt can be placed in a difficult situation. Egypt will be greatly affected in terms of supplying normal water volume, flood storage, and flood prevention. The reason why the United States is so interested in the Blue Nile River is that by controlling the water source, it can exert enormous pressure on Egypt to force Egypt to succumb to the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The United States' use of controlling the Nile River's water source to exert pressure on Egypt is supported by Britain. Because British East Africa's Uganda, Kenya, and Tanganyika are all around Lake Victoria, the source of the White Nile River. Britain has even issued news that it will use the method of cutting off the water source of the White Nile River to suppress Egypt. Nixon's visit to Uganda was clearly related to this matter.

The "New York Times" reported not long ago that after Nixon's visits to Uganda and Ethiopia, the Ugandan colonial authorities' interest in "developing" the Nile River has increased even more. In addition to the Owen Falls hydroelectric project built in 1954, Uganda also plans to build a large dam this year. When the power plant is completed in 1965, it will have a power generation capacity of 150,000 kilowatts. The news also said that Uganda, Kenya, and Tanganyika in British East Africa around the lake all demanded to get a "reasonable share" in the use of Lake Victoria's water. In 1929, Egypt signed the "Nile River Water Agreement" with Sudan, stipulating that Egypt has priority in using river water. According to the "New York Times," Britain intends to "review" this agreement. Because Sudan had not yet become independent when the agreement was signed, it was signed by Britain on behalf of Sudan. Britain is now trying to use this position to infringe upon Egypt's rights.

This imperialist conspiracy to strangle the Nile River is worthy of attention, but it is not so easy for them to realize this conspiracy. Because the water volume in the upper reaches of the Nile River is very large and cannot be completely controlled. Moreover, the African people are becoming increasingly aware, and time is not on the side of the imperialists. In addition, when the imperialists unite to deal with the Egyptian people, dog-eat-dog situations will usually occur among them. An editorial in the "Times" on April 8, entitled "America in Africa," mentioned Nixon's proposal to "develop" the Nile River, and at the same time said meaningfully: "If Africa is to remain a part of the free world, the most necessary thing is for Britain and the United States to understand what each intends to do there, in order to avoid misunderstandings."

Those who play with fire are bound to get burned, and those who play with water are bound to drown. The United States is not only playing with fire in the Middle East, but also wants to play with water. Water and fire are merciless, and the American aggressors are bound to be unlucky.

    玩水的阴谋	万峰
    不久以前，美国商务部宣布：它的海岸和测量勘察部门将派一队人到埃塞俄比亚去测绘青尼罗河流域。据说，这是为了开发青尼罗河流域和给埃塞俄比亚“造福”。
    美国对于尼罗河显然越来越有兴趣了。1956年10月，杜勒斯一面拒绝帮助埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝，一面向联合国安全理事会声明说，美国“准备在一个适当的时候，并且根据各沿河国家的要求，考虑能够采取什么步骤来为了这个地区的各国人民的利益更有效地使用尼罗河的水力资源”。今年1月初，华盛顿晚报“明星报”曾透露，美国政府在酝酿“一个大规模开发尼罗河的计划”，并把这个计划列入在中近东实行侵略扩张的“艾森豪威尔主义”之中。尼克松在今年2、3月间访问非洲国家时，曾和乌干达、埃塞俄比亚两国当局着重谈判了“开发”尼罗河问题。他在回国后的报告中，又专门谈到“开发”尼罗河的重要性，并建议当局“在政治局势允许的时候，支持符合一切有关国家的共同利益的开发河流的集体努力”。
    美国对“开发”尼罗河这样有兴趣，据说是因为它非常希望“造福”沿河国家。可是，4月2日的“纽约时报”并不是平白无故地说这样的话的：“供给下尼罗河（指埃及境内的一段尼罗河） 84％的水量的青尼罗河发源在埃塞俄比亚境内。这一点大大增加了埃塞俄比亚在战略上的重要性。”
    美国眼中的埃塞俄比亚的“战略重要性”指的是哪一方面？
    尼罗河是世界上最大的河流之一，流域面积达二百八十六万七千平方公里。它有两条主要的支流。一条是白尼罗河，发源于乌干达境内的维多利亚湖。一条是青尼罗河，发源于埃塞俄比亚境内的塔纳湖。白尼罗河和青尼罗河在苏丹的首都喀土穆相汇合，成为尼罗河的主流，往北经埃及入地中海。而埃及境内这一段尼罗河，五分之四的水源来自青尼罗河。
    尼罗河是埃及人民的母亲，是埃及人民的“命根子”。在埃及全国将近一百万平方公里的土地面积中，只有3.1％左右是耕地。这些耕地的三分之二在尼罗河三角洲。二千三百多万的埃及人民，都集中在沿尼罗河流域的一条狭长的沃土地带。那里的人口密度每平方哩约为一千六百人，为世界上有数的人口密度。埃及每年降雨量很少，种地全靠尼罗河的水。埃及的主要农作物棉花，同尼罗河的涨落更有密切的关系。埃及要扩大耕地，就需要有更多的水。但是，埃及在尼罗河的下游，水源不在自己的境内。
    因此，所谓埃塞俄比亚的“战略上的重要性”，就是只要控制了发源于埃塞俄比亚的青尼罗河的水源，就可以制埃及于困难的境地，在供应正常水量、蓄洪、防洪等方面，埃及都将受到很大的影响。美国之所以对青尼罗河有这么大的兴趣，就是因为通过控制水源，可以对埃及施加巨大的压力，来迫使埃及向“艾森豪威尔主义”屈服。
    美国利用控制尼罗河水源来对埃及施加压力，是得到英国的支持的。因为英属东非的乌干达、怯尼亚和坦噶尼喀都在白尼罗河发源地维多利亚湖周围。英国就曾经发出过要用切断白尼罗河水源的办法来压制埃及的消息。尼克松访问乌干达、显然同这事有关。
   “纽约时报”不久以前报道说，在尼克松访问过乌干达、埃塞俄比亚以后，乌干达殖民当局对“开发”尼罗河的兴趣更加增大了。除了在1954年兴建的欧温瀑布的水电工程以外，乌干达今年还计划建立一个大水坝，到1965年发电厂建成时可拥有十五万瓩的发电能力。这条消息还说，环湖的英属东非的乌干达、怯尼亚和坦噶尼喀，都要求在利用维多利亚湖水方面得到“合理的一份”。1929年，埃及曾经和苏丹签订“尼罗河河水协定”，规定埃及在使用河水方面有优先权。据“纽约时报”说，英国打算再“审查”这项协定。因为协定签订时苏丹尚未独立，所以是由英国代苏丹签字的。英国现在就企图利用这个地位，来侵犯埃及的权利。
    帝国主义这个扼杀尼罗河的阴谋是值得注意的，但是它们要实现这个阴谋，却并不那么容易。因为尼罗河上游的水量很大，不可能完全控制。而且，非洲人民日益觉醒，时间对帝国主义者们是不利的。此外，帝国主义者们在一起对付埃及人民的时候，它们之间照例要发生狗咬狗的情形。4月8日“泰晤士报”的一篇以“美国在非洲”为题的社论，提到了尼克松关于“开发”尼罗河的建议，同时还意味深长地说：“如果非洲要保持为自由世界的一部分的话，最必要的是英国和美国要了解彼此打算在那里做什么，以避免彼此误解”。
    玩火的人免不了要引火烧身，玩水的人免不了要淹死。美国在中东不仅玩火，而且还想玩水。水火无情，美国侵略者肯定是要倒霉的。
