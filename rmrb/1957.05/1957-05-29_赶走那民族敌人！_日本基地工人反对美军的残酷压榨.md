    “Drive Out the National Enemy!”
    —Japanese Base Workers Oppose Cruel Exploitation by the U.S. Military
    Pei Da
    The "Japan Garrison Labor Union" has decided to hold a strike in the period from late May to late June to oppose the new exploitation measures of the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan. This is a new and powerful action in the Japanese people's movement against U.S. enslavement and for national independence.

    There are approximately 177,000 Japanese workers working at U.S. military bases, of whom approximately 90,000 are members of the "All Garrison Forces Labor Union" (participating in the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and more than 11,000 are members of the "Japan Garrison Labor Union" (participating in the All-Japan Trade Union Conference). Under the leadership of the labor unions, the base workers have continuously launched struggles against the cruel oppression of the U.S. military authorities in recent years, demonstrating a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit. On August 27 last year, 158,000 base workers held a 24-hour general strike to oppose the "new sanction regulations." On this day, the transportation of military supplies, the distribution of letters, hospital operations, and the work of the cooking departments at U.S. military bases were paralyzed. Thousands of workers, hand in hand, sang the "Song of the National Independence Action Team" and demonstrated in front of the U.S. military base gates. The worker picketers who appeared in front of the U.S. Far East Command headquarters shouted: "Hey! Hey! Yankees go home!" During this year's spring struggle of Japanese workers, 107,000 base workers held two-hour strikes to demand wage increases. Female workers at the Tachikawa base persisted in a strike for a month to protest disguised dismissals.

    Japanese workers working at U.S. military bases are directly subjected to the oppression of the U.S. military authorities and have been living a humiliating life. They are regarded as thieves by the Americans, and all fingerprints of both hands must be pressed on the worker's ID card. When going to work, they must take an entrance card written in English, and under the supervision of tall U.S. military police holding pistols, they enter the base with a sign that says "Japanese Forbidden." When they get off work, they are even subjected to personal inspections. Female workers have to untie their underwear, and even their lunch boxes have to be opened for American soldiers to see. A base worker in Osaka wrote in his diary: "In my own country, it's like working as a laborer in a foreign country!"

    Female base workers are subjected to all kinds of insults by the Americans. American soldiers often ask female workers to light cigarettes for them, taking the opportunity to kiss them. Female workers who refuse to sell their chastity are fired. Female workers are subjected to physiological examinations during their "menstrual period." Many female workers say: The U.S. military regards female base workers as "panpan" girls.

    Base workers have no freedom of speech or thought. At U.S. military bases, in addition to talking about baseball, they are not allowed to say "oppose atomic war," they are not allowed to say "recognize New China," and they are not allowed to sing "La Marseillaise." Anyone who does this will be punished. Once, a worker said, "Britain has labor insurance, which is better than the United States," and was later fired.

    In the worker's sheds at U.S. military bases, there are not even toilets. Workers eat on the ground when they are hungry and drink raw water when they are thirsty. The U.S. military authorities stipulate that dismissal will result after three days of absence. Even if they are sick, the diagnosis of Japanese doctors is useless, so workers have to go to work even if they are seriously ill. Some workers who are seriously injured do not even receive a penny of medical expenses. At the end of the Korean War, base workers were forced to donate blood for the U.S. military regardless of their own wishes, and they did not get enough rest time after the blood donation. Some workers fell ill because of blood donation.

    Japanese workers working at the base are not protected by Japanese law, and American soldiers can shoot them at will. In July 1954, a Japanese worker was shot and killed by a U.S. military policeman while on duty. The two workers who witnessed this incident were also transferred and were not allowed to talk about it.

    However, Japanese base workers are increasingly united in order to defend their right to life and strive for freedom. They have erected the banner of national independence in front of American guns; the singing of the "Song of the National Independence Action Team" is earth-shattering, summoning the Japanese working people to advance bravely:

    To the bloody rule of the enemy,
    Fight back with the blood of justice;
    Severely strike the traitors,
    Drive out the national enemy! (Attached picture)

    “赶走那民族敌人！”
    ——日本基地工人反对美军的残酷压榨
    裴达
    “日本驻军工会”为反对驻日美军当局新的剥削措施，决定在5月下旬至6月下旬的期间内举行罢工。这是日本人民反对美国的奴役、争取民族独立运动中的一个新的有力行动。
    在美军基地工作的日本工人约有十七万七千多人，其中约有九万人组成了“全驻军工会”（参加日本工会总评议会），有一万一千多人组成了“日本驻军工会”（参加全日本工会会议）。基地工人在工会领导下，几年来不断地对美军当局的残酷压榨展开斗争，表现了英勇顽强的战斗精神。去年8月27日，十五万八千名基地工人为反对“新制裁规定”，举行了二十四小时总罢工。这一天，美军基地的军需品的输送、信件的分发、医院的业务、炊事部门的工作等，都陷于瘫痪状态。成千上万的工人手挽着手，高唱“民族独立行动队之歌”，在美军基地门前示威游行。出现在美国远东军司令部大门前的工人纠察队员们高呼：“嘿！嘿！美国佬滚回去！”在今年日本工人春季斗争中，为要求增加工资，十万七千名基地工人分别举行了两小时的罢工。立川基地女工为反对变相解雇，坚持罢工达一个月之久。
    在美军基地工作的日本工人，直接遭受着美军当局的压榨，一直过着屈辱的日子。他们被美国佬看作小偷一样，在工人身份证上要按上两手的全部指纹。上班的时候，他们必须拿上写着英文的入门证，在高大的拿着手枪的美国宪兵监视下走进挂着“日本人禁止入内”的牌子的基地里去。下班的时候，他们更受到人身检查，女工要解开内衣，甚至连饭盒子都得翻开让美国兵看看。大阪一个基地工人在他的日记上写道：“在自己的祖国，好像在外国作劳工一样！”
    基地女工遭到美国佬的百般侮辱。美国兵常常要女工给他们点香烟，借这机会去吻她们。拒绝出卖贞操的女工，就遭到解雇。女工“例假”时，要受生理检验。许多女工都说：美军把基地女工都看成是“乓乓”女郎。
    基地工人没有言论、思想的自由。在美军基地，除了谈论棒球以外，不许说“反对原子战争”，不许说“承认新中国”，不许唱“马赛曲”。谁要这样作，就会遭到惩罚。有次，一个工人说，“英国有劳动保险，比美国好”，后来就被解雇了。
    在美军基地的工棚里，连厕所都没有。工人饿了就在地上吃饭，渴了喝生水。美军当局规定，三日缺勤就要退职。即使生了病，日本医生的诊断书也不中用，因此工人得了重病也得上班。有的工人受了重伤，甚至连一文医疗费也得不到。在朝鲜战争结束时，基地工人不论自己愿不愿意，都要被迫为美军输血，输血之后还得不到充分的休息时间。有些工人因为输血而病倒了。
    在基地作工的日本工人，是得不到日本法律的保障的，美国兵可以随意枪杀他们。1954年7月，一个日本工人在值班时被美国宪兵杀死了。亲眼看见这件事情的两个工人，也被调换了工作，并且不准他们谈论这件事。
    但是，日本基地工人为保卫生活权利，争取自由，他们日益紧密地团结起来了。他们在美军枪口之前，树起了民族独立的旗帜；“民族独立行动队之歌”的歌声，惊天动地，召唤着日本劳动人民英勇前进：
    对敌人的血腥统治，
    要以正义的鲜血去抗争；
    狠狠打击卖国贼，
    赶走那民族敌人！（附图片）
    （1956年秋天，日本全国学联的代表在立川美军基地飞机跑道前面集会，宣布反对美军扩充基地的斗争决心。）
