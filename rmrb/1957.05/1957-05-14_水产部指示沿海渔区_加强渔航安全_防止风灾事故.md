Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The Ministry of Aquatic Products recently issued instructions requiring all coastal fishing areas to earnestly prevent wind disasters and ensure safe production.

The instructions stated that since the beginning of spring, serious wind disasters have occurred continuously in coastal fishing areas of Hebei, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and other provinces. The causes of these accidents are mainly insufficient safety education for fishermen and fishing navigation in some areas, a lack of strong sense of responsibility among some cadres, and serious complacency among some fishermen. To this end, all localities should conscientiously do the following:

    I. Continue to conduct in-depth education on safe production, and earnestly implement the principle of safety first.

    II. Strengthen the leadership of typhoon warning stations and the political and ideological education of their staff.

    III. Do a good job of safety preparations before going to sea. Before ships go to sea, safety inspections must be carried out, and necessary life-saving and wind-proofing equipment should be added and carried where possible. Ships at sea should have dedicated personnel to pay attention to weather forecasts. When strong wind warnings are received, they should be promptly conveyed, and ships should be organized to return to port. No one should make independent decisions to continue production. Once ships at sea encounter disaster, local authorities should promptly find ways to rescue them.

    IV. Properly handle the aftermath of wind disasters: extend condolences to the families of the victims and fishing cooperatives, and provide appropriate relief. Every accident should be carefully investigated, the causes analyzed, and effective measures proposed to prevent them in the future. Those responsible for accidents should be given appropriate treatment according to the size of the accident and the severity of the circumstances.

    水产部指示沿海渔区
    加强渔航安全　防止风灾事故
    据新华社13日讯　水产部最近发出指示，要求沿海各渔区切实防止风灾事故，做好安全生产。
    指示说，入春以来，河北、广东、福建、山东等省的沿海渔区都连续发生了严重的风灾事故。造成事故的原因，主要是一些地区对渔民渔航安全教育不够，某些干部责任心不强，以及部分渔民存有严重的麻痹思想。为此，各地应当认真做好以下几项工作：
    一、继续深入进行安全生产的教育，认真贯彻安全第一的原则。
    二、加强对暴风警报站的领导及其工作人员的政治思想教育。
    三、出海前做好安全准备工作。船只出海，必须进行安全检查，在可能的条件下增添和携带必要的救生和防风设备。出海船只应有专人注意收听气象预报，收到大风消息时应及时传达，组织回港，不得擅自决定继续生产。船只在海上一旦遇难，当地应及时设法抢救。
    四、妥善处理风灾事故的善后工作：向受灾的家属和渔业社进行慰问，并且予以适当的救济，对每一次事故都应该认真检查，分析发生的原因，提出今后防止的有效措施。对事故的责任者，应根据事故大小、情节轻重，给予适当处理。
