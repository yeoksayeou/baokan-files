Xinhua News Agency, Amman, May 15th: The Jordanian Royal Palace announced on May 14th that King Hussein of Jordan has decided not to go to Baghdad to meet with the Kings of Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

A statement issued by the Jordanian Royal Palace stated that King Hussein had received an "invitation from the Kings of Iraq and Saudi Arabia to hold talks during the Saudi King's current visit to Baghdad." It said, "However, current conditions prevent the King from making such a visit at this time."

Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai said at a press conference on May 14th that the Jordanian government is now committed to improving the overall situation in the country. He stated that Jordan's "Arab national policy will never change, nor will it deviate from the direction of the Arab nation."

Rifai said that Jordan is prepared to accept any foreign aid, as long as such aid does not have conditions attached and does not affect its sovereignty and independence.

Rifai also said that the Arab Solidarity Agreement between Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan has not yet come into effect. Therefore, the financial assistance from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to Jordan is not legally due for payment. He said, however, that the Saudi Arabian government has made a special arrangement with the Arab Bank in Amman, according to which Jordan can withdraw the Saudi Arabian share of five million pounds before the Arab Solidarity Agreement comes into effect. He said that Jordan is urging Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to approve the agreement as soon as possible.

The Jordanian cabinet decided on the evening of May 13th to merge the Jordanian police with the army. On the same day, another twenty-six patriots were arrested, most of whom were teachers.

    侯赛因决定不去巴格达会谈
    里法伊表示约旦不脱离阿拉伯民族方向
    据新华社15日讯　安曼消息：约旦王宫5月14日宣布，约旦国王侯赛因已经决定不去巴格达同伊拉克国王和沙特阿拉伯国王会谈。
    约旦王宫发表的一项声明说，侯赛因国王已经接到“伊拉克国王和沙特阿拉伯国王在沙特国王目前在巴格达访问期间举行会谈的邀请”。它说：“但是，目前的条件使国王无法在此时进行这种访问。”
    约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊5月14日在记者招待会上说，约旦政府现在致力于改善国内总的局势。他作这样的表示：约旦的“阿拉伯民族政策决不改变，也决不脱离阿拉伯民族的方向”。
    里法伊说，约旦准备接受任何外国援助，只要这种援助没有附带条件并且不影响它的主权和独立。
    里法伊还说，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四国的阿拉伯团结协定还没有生效，因此，埃、叙、沙三国对约旦的财政援助在法律上说还不到付款的时候。他说，但是沙特阿拉伯政府同安曼的阿拉伯银行进行了特别安排，根据这种安排，在阿拉伯团结协定生效以前，约旦能够支取沙特阿拉伯分担的五百万英镑。他说，约旦要求埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯赶快批准这项协定。
    约旦内阁在5月13日晚间决定把约旦警察同军队合并。同一天，又有二十六个爱国人士被逮捕，其中大部分是教师。
