    Thoughts
  　Xu Gan
    "Live and learn," is a very good motto. Some even add, "Learn until you die," which fully illustrates the importance of tireless learning.
    But if, while saying this, the situation is allowed to develop like this: eight years ago, you were a lathe operator's apprentice, and eight years later, you are still a lathe operator's apprentice; if another eight years pass, you still can't do without your master, then something is not right. This example is a bit exaggerated, but in the work posts of many business departments, young people who have been learning while doing for three or five years have made little progress, still can't do much, and can only continue learning; as for those who call themselves young authors, writing bad poems for five years and painting Venuses for seven years, and still show no signs of improvement, there are also many. If this were in the hands of the older generation, they would raise their beards and scold you for "fiddling and fiddling until the eel turns into mud."
    No matter what objective conditions are, everything is better than it was ten or twenty years ago, so how can some people still not learn? Is it perhaps precisely because the objective conditions are too good? This is probably one of the reasons. In addition, there may be many other reasons, among which what is particularly worrying is that some people seem to think that not learning is okay, anyway, the word "expel" has almost been expelled from the dictionary, and if you don't get promoted for three years, you can still raise opinions to the leadership; it seems that some people have learned another set of empty skills, which are: you call, I respond, give tasks, make sweeping guarantees, fail to complete, fortunately the inspection is not careful, if the inspection is really serious, self-criticism can block it for a while, forgive the young age. – If you learn like this, I am afraid you will really have to "learn" until you are old, but you will lack the "doing" until you are old mentioned above.
    The words are spoken in a "old and mature" way, which is very unpleasant to hear, but in fact, it is not only blaming others, but also blaming myself, and asking the youth's mentors.

    “做到老，学到老”，这是一句很好的格言。有人还续上一句“学到死”，更是充分地说明了好学不倦的重要性儿。
    但如果一面这么说，一面把情形搞成这样：八年前是旋工的徒弟，八年后仍然是学徒的旋工，再放八年下去，还是寸步离不了师傅，那可有点不妙了。这个例子有点夸张，不过在好些业务部门的工作岗位上，边做边学了三年五年，很少进步，依然做不了什么，只好一路学下去的小伙子，见到听到的不少；至于自称青年作者，写了五年歪诗，画了七年维娜斯，始终看不出苗头来的，也不少。这要是在老辈手里，就会胡须翘起，骂你“修修修，修得黄鳝变泥鳅”了。
    无论什么客观条件，一条条一件件都比十年二十年前好，怎么还会有人如此学不进去呢？难道正因为客观条件太好了的缘故？这恐怕确是缘故之一。此外还可以有许多缘故，其中特别教人担心的是，似乎有人觉得不学也行，反正“开除”这个词几乎已经开除出词典了，三年不升级还能向领导提意见；似乎还有人另外学了一套空头本领，这一套是：你号召、我响应，交任务、海阔天空提保证，完不成、好在检查不认真，万一检查认了真，自我批评挡一阵，原谅小的年纪轻。——这样学下去，恐怕是真的要“学”到老的，却缺少了上面的“做”到老。
    话说得“老气横秋”的很难听，其实不单责人，也责自己，并借问青年的导师们。
