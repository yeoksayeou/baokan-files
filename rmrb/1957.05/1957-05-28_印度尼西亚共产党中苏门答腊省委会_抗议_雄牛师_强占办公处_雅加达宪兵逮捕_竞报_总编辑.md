Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th. "Dongxing Bao" of Jakarta reported today that the office of the Central Sumatra Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia in Bukittinggi was unreasonably seized by the "Banteng Division Committee". The Provincial Committee has therefore protested to the "Banteng Division Committee."

The protest letter stated that the "Banteng Division Committee" used the military curfew to seize the Provincial Committee's office on the 13th, claiming it was to be used as an office for the assistant to the military commander of Agam Regency, while there were actually surplus government buildings in the area that were not being used.

The protest letter stated that the purpose of the "Banteng Division Committee" was to suppress the struggle against them. The "Banteng Division Committee" had previously arrested cadres of the Communist Party of Indonesia and leaders of mass organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 26th. The Jakarta military police arrested Yang Mingyue, the editor-in-chief of "Keng Po". A military spokesman said that this action was taken because "Keng Po" had several times confused facts with opinions in the news it published, thereby creating tension on the "Army issue."

Jakarta Garrison Commander Dahyar issued a statement, once again urging the press to comply with the requirements of the Army Chief of Staff. Army Chief of Staff Nasution had requested the press at the end of April: not to report sensational news that has not been verified and does not come from authoritative sources, not to mix facts and opinions, and not to report news that is detrimental to national prestige and military discipline.

    印度尼西亚共产党中苏门答腊省委会
    抗议“雄牛师”强占办公处
    雅加达宪兵逮捕“竞报”总编辑
    据新华社雅加达27日电　雅加达“东星报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党中苏门答腊省委员会在武吉丁宜的办公处被“雄牛师委员会”无理强占。省委会因此向“雄牛师委员会”提出了抗议。
    抗议书说，“雄牛师委员会”利用军事戒严令在13日强占了省委会的办公处，说是要给阿甘县的军事长官的助理作办公室，实际上当地还有多余的政府房屋没有利用。
    抗议书说，“雄牛师委员会”的目的是镇压反对他们的斗争。“雄牛师委员会”以前曾经逮捕印度尼西亚共产党的干部和群众团体的领导人。
    据新华社雅加达26日电　雅加达的宪兵逮捕了“竞报”总编辑杨明月。军方发言人说，采取这一行动是因为“竞报”有几次在发表的消息中用意见来混淆事实，从而就“陆军问题”制造紧张空气。
    雅加达卫戍司令达赫亚尔发表了一项声明，再一次促使新闻界遵从陆军参谋长的要求。陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安曾经在4月底要求新闻界：不要报道还未得到证实的、不是来自权威方面的耸人听闻的消息，不要把事实和意见混在一起，不要报道有损于国家威信和军人纪律的消息。
