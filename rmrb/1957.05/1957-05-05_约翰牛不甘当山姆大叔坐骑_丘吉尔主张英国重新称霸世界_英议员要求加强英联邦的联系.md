Xinhua News Agency, London, May 4th: John Bull Refuses to be Uncle Sam's Steed
Churchill Advocates for Britain to Reclaim World Domination
British Parliamentarians Demand Strengthened Ties within the Commonwealth

    London dispatch: Former British Prime Minister Churchill broke his silence of nearly a year and delivered a speech on the 3rd at an organization of the Conservative Party, demanding that Britain continue to "shoulder the leadership responsibility of the world."
    He said that the world is changing rapidly, and in the sharp international competition, Britain must "continue to run ahead where it leads" and "catch up where it lags behind."
    Speaking of the United Nations' condemnation of Eden on the Suez issue, Churchill expressed deep dissatisfaction. He also said meaningfully: "Those who once attacked him (Eden) at home and abroad for taking resolute action with our French allies last autumn may now have to reconsider their opinions."
    It is believed that Churchill's words were directed at the Americans. Recently, British public opinion has been complaining about the American "ally" who pretended to be peaceful on the Suez issue but took military threats against Jordan.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 4th: American infiltration is threatening the foundations of the British Empire, causing unease among British parliamentarians.
    Labor MP Emanuel Shinwell expressed concern in the House of Commons yesterday about the danger of the Commonwealth becoming an economic satellite of the United States. He warned that "unless we can unite with the Commonwealth countries and make ourselves less dependent on the United States, Britain's independence will be undermined in secret, and undoubtedly soon."
    Conservative MP Lanford-Holt also warned that Britain should beware of letting American aid turn it into a dollar empire and a dollar lifestyle.

    丘吉尔主张英国重新称霸世界
    英议员要求加强英联邦的联系
    本报讯　伦敦消息：前英国首相丘吉尔打破了将近一年的沉默，他于3日在保守党的一个组织里发表演说，要求英国继续“担负起世界的领导责任”。
    他说，世界在迅速变化着，在尖锐的国际竞赛中，英国必须在它“领先的地方继续跑在前面”，在它“落后的地方迎头赶上”。
    说到联合国在苏伊士问题上对艾登的谴责，丘吉尔深表不平。他还意味深长地说：“曾经在国内外攻击过他（艾登）在去年秋天同我们的法国盟友一起采取坚决行动的那些人也许现在应该重新考虑一下他们的意见了。”
    人们认为，丘吉尔的这些话是说给美国人听的。最近以来，英国舆论界对于在苏伊士问题上装作和平姿态而对约旦采取军事威胁的美国“盟友”已经啧有烦言了。
    据新华社伦敦4日电　美国的渗入正在威胁英帝国的基础，使英国议员们感到不安。
    工党议员伊曼纽尔·辛威尔昨天在下院表示担心英联邦有变成美国的经济卫星国的危险。他警告说，“除非我们能够同英联邦国家联合，并且使自己不那么依靠美国，否则，英国的独立将在暗中遭到破坏，而且无疑是很快的事。”
    保守党议员兰弗德—霍尔特也提出警告，英国应当提防让美援把它变成美元帝国和美元生活方式。
