    Publish the Accounts to the Commune Members Soon
    Since the establishment of the Guangming First Cooperative of Fuwen Township, Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, at the beginning of last year, the cooperative has not disclosed any of its accounts to the members, and the final distribution of profits has been delayed. The members composed a flower lantern song called "The Twelve Months," vividly expressing their urgent desire for distribution and the disclosure of accounts. I have excerpted a few sections below:
    In the first month of the year, the first month is here,
    Singing about the distribution of sideline income for you to hear,
    Many members are having conflicts,
    Unsure if sideline income will be distributed.
    In the second month, the spring equinox arrives,
    Sideline income could be distributed sooner,
    It's not the leaders delaying you,
    The accountant hasn't finished calculating.
    In the third month, busy with spring plowing,
    Unsure when the sideline income will be distributed,
    Distribute some so we can buy farming tools,
    So we can engage in spring plowing.
    …………
    In the seventh month, the Ghost Festival arrives,
    Raising ducks for sideline income is profitable,
    All the ducks have been sold,
    But the accounts haven't been settled with the members.
    …………
    In the ninth month, the Double Ninth Festival arrives,
    Several accountants can't manage it (can't calculate clearly),
    Asking when the sideline income will be distributed,
    Waiting until the twenty-ninth of the twelfth month.
    In the tenth month, Indian summer arrives,
    The accountant is not attentive,
    The calculations for green manure and fertilizer are wrong,
    Two thousand work points are incorrect.
    …………
    In the twelfth month, another year arrives,
    Diligent work earns more money,
    Grain and sideline income in hand,
    To celebrate a lively new year.
    The flower lantern song begins,
    A lot of trouble for the accountants,
    Regardless of the amount,
    Hoping the accountants will distribute it soon!
    This "flower lantern" song was first sung among the masses, then to the township people's committee, and finally to the district government. Despite causing such a large stir, the final distribution of profits has not yet taken place, and the district and township leaders have not supervised or assisted. Some time ago, the members questioned the cooperative cadres again, and the reply was "It is being finalized," but it continues to be delayed. This has greatly affected the members' enthusiasm for production. When the cooperative arranges work, some members ignore it. If this problem is not resolved, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. It is hoped that the leaders of Suiyang County will quickly send people to help resolve it.

### 快些向社员公布账目吧

    快些向社员公布账目吧
    贵州绥阳县富文乡光明一分社去年年初建社以后，社里所有账目一直未向社员公布过，分配决算迟迟不做。社员们曾编了一首花灯“十二月”，生动地唱出了他们对分配和账目公开的迫切心情。我把它摘录几段在下面：
    正月里来正月正，
    唱分副业与你听，
    很多社员闹矛盾，
    不知副业分不分。
    二月里来是春分，
    副业可以早点分，
    不是领导拖累你，
    会计没有算得清。
    三月里来忙春耕，
    不知副业哪阵分，
    分点我们置农具，
    我们好去搞春耕。
    …………
    七月里来七月半，
    鸭子副业有钱赚，
    全部鸭子卖光了，
    未跟社员把账算。
    …………
    九月里来九月九，
    几个会计搞不走（算不清），
    问他副业哪阵分，
    等到腊月二十九。
    十月里来小阳春，
    会计办事不用心，
  　干肥青肥算错了，
    工分错了两千分。
    …………
    腊月里来又一年，
    勤快出工多分钱，
    粮食副业分到手，
    拿去过个热闹年。
    花灯唱起要起身，
    几位会计费了心，
    多多少少都不论，
    希望会计早些分！
    这首“花灯”先演唱在群众中，后来演唱到乡人民委员会，最后又演唱到区政府。虽然起了这样大的风波，但分配决算仍未进行，区乡领导方面也没有去督促和帮助。前些日子社员们又向社干提出质问，回答是“正在决算中”，但还是一拖再拖。这大大地影响了社员们的生产积极性。社里布置工作，有些社员就不理睬。如果这问题再不解决，其影响是不难想像的。希望绥阳县领导方面赶快派人去帮助解决。
