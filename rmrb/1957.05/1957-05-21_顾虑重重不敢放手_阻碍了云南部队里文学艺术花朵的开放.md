Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 20th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Changzong reports: From May 15th to 18th, literary, artistic, medical, propaganda, and cultural workers stationed with the People's Liberation Army in Yunnan enthusiastically discussed what was hindering the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in the troops.

Participants in the discussion believed that while various regions are now boldly implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, many people in the troops are eager to try, but many departments remain silent. This is mainly because the leadership of the troops has not fully understood the Party's policy, harbors excessive concerns, and is afraid to let go.

Literary and artistic workers participating in the discussion pointed out that commandism and simplistic work styles exist in the leadership of literary and artistic work in the troops. If these are not corrected, the flowers of literature and art will be difficult to bloom well. Some people mentioned that the leadership does not lead literary and artistic work based on its characteristics, but instead uses the methods of commanding a company, relying on orders and discipline. A member of a song and dance troupe said that a responsible comrade from the General Political Department's Cultural Department once said that things are easy to handle in our troops; there is no need to discuss what to perform back and forth like local art groups; just issue an order. The leaders below are even more serious in their commandism. Some actors in the performing arts troupe mentioned that it is unreasonable for the party branch to lead the troupe's professional work. Of their seven party branch members, four do not understand the profession at all. They suggested organizing an art guidance committee, composed of party members and non-party members with high professional skills, to lead the troupe's professional work.

Some people, in their speeches, pointed out that the troop leadership has sectarian sentiments in their attitude towards intellectuals. Teachers at the quick-course middle school mentioned that intellectuals in the troops have much more difficulty than cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds in joining the Party and getting promoted. Writer Peng Jingfeng said that a young intellectual in a certain unit, who has been in the army for eight years and has published three collections of novels, is still a deputy platoon-level cadre. Someone said that a pharmacist was unable to engage in professional research for a long time and was transferred to odd jobs during the construction of barracks, working as a foreman and doing cost accounting; a university student majoring in English was not assigned a job as an English teacher, but was instead made to manage stationery. A teacher at the quick-course middle school said: "One of our teachers criticized the school-level military officer students, and a political leader actually said to the teacher: 'When they were climbing snow mountains and crossing grasslands, you were not even born yet; when they came to liberate you, you were still singing reactionary songs!'"

Some people in their speeches revealed the crude and arrogant attitude of certain leading cadres towards literary and artistic work. A member of a song and dance troupe said: "Our army commander once watched the song and dance troupe dance, and because the performance was not good, the commander cursed the actors as hooligans on the spot." Zhang Huarui, head of the Peking Opera troupe, said: "The leaders always pre-select the repertoire and actors when they watch a play, but if the leader's interest changes midway, the repertoire and actors have to be greatly changed, which makes the entire troupe flustered."

Many people also talked about the troop's rigid rules and regulations, which restricted "voicing" and "letting go." Someone said: "Our troops are managed too strictly, with too many 'golden hoops.'" The head of the propaganda section of the infantry school criticized the phenomenon of a skit satirizing the poor service attitude of a certain department being reviewed for more than a month. A teacher from the quick-course middle school reflected: "One of the leading cadres in our school stipulated that any manuscripts that were praising could be published after being read by the teacher's group, but critical manuscripts had to be reviewed by him before they could be published."

### 顾虑重重不敢放手  阻碍了云南部队里文学艺术花朵的开放

    顾虑重重不敢放手
    阻碍了云南部队里文学艺术花朵的开放
    据新华社昆明20日电　新华社记者周长宗报道：解放军驻云南部队的文艺、医务、宣传、文教工作者等，15日到18日热烈讨论了什么东西阻碍部队贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的问题。
    参加讨论的人认为，现在各地都在放手贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，部队中许多人都跃跃欲试，但是也有不少部门，仍是一片沉寂。这主要是因为部队领导上没有很好地理解党的这一方针，顾虑重重，不敢放手。
    参加讨论的文学艺术工作者提出，部队中对文艺工作的领导，存在着命令主义和简单化的作风，如不纠正，文学艺术的花朵就难以开放得好。有人谈到，领导上不是根据文艺工作的特点领导文艺工作，而是用指挥连队的那套方法，靠命令、纪律办事。歌舞团的一个团员说，总政治部文化部一个负责同志就说过，我们部队里好办事，对于演什么，用不着像地方文艺团体那样讨论过来、讨论过去，只要下个命令就行了。下边的领导同志，命令主义就更严重。文工团的一些演员谈到，部队文工团业务领导归党支部，很不合理。他们的党支部中，七个支部委员有四个根本不懂业务。他们建议组织艺术指导委员会，由业务水平高的党员和非党员组成，来领导文工团的业务。
    一些人在发言中，指出在对待知识分子的态度上，部队领导方面有宗派主义情绪。速成中学的教员谈到，部队中的知识分子在入党、提级方面，都比工农出身的干部困难得多。作家彭荆风说，某单位一个搞创作的知识青年，参军八年了，出版了三部小说集，至今仍是个副排级干部。有人说，有一个药剂师，长期得不到从事业务研究的条件，在建筑营房时调去打杂，当工头，搞经济核算；一个英文系的大学生，有英文教员的差事不派他干，却让他去管理文具。速成中学的一个教员说：“我们学校中一个教员，对校级军官学员提出了批评，有一个政治领导干部对教员讲话时竟说：他们爬雪山过草地的时候，你们还没有出世；当他们来解放你们的时候，你们那时还唱反动歌呢！”
    有些人在发言中揭露了某些领导干部对文学艺术工作的粗暴和蛮横态度。歌舞团的一个团员说：“我们军的军长有一回看歌舞团跳舞，由于演得不好，军长竟当场破口大骂演员是流氓。”京剧团团长张化锐说：“首长看戏都是先把剧目和演员点好，可是中途首长的兴趣变了，剧目和演员就得大变动，弄得整个剧团手忙脚乱。
    不少人还谈到了部队的清规戒律，束缚了“鸣”和“放”。有人说：“我们部队统得太严，‘金箍咒’太多。”步兵学校的宣传科长对一篇讽刺某部门服务态度不好的小品文竟被审稿审了一个多月的现象，提出批评。速成中学的一位教员反映：“我们学校的一位领导干部规定，凡是表扬的稿子，教员组看过以后就可以发表，批评性的稿子，必须经过他审查以后才能发表。”
