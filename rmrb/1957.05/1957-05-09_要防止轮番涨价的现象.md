Title: Prevent the Phenomenon of Successive Price Increases

    The price increases of some commodities in Jiujiang City are unreasonable. For example, last year in April and May, a dan (approximately 50kg) of pine firewood cost 8 jiao, but now it has risen to 1 yuan and 8 jiao. Charcoal originally cost about 2 yuan per dan, but now it is 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Vegetables used to be 3 or 4 fen per jin (approximately 0.5kg), but now ordinary vegetables are generally about 1 jiao per jin. A haircut used to cost 2 jiao, but now it costs 3 jiao. A bathtub bath has increased from 3 jiao to 4 jiao; a public bath has increased from 1 jiao 5 fen to 2 jiao.

    With so many things having risen in price, it seems that the price of grain should also increase, otherwise it will harm farmers because of low grain prices. This will inevitably lead to successive price increases, which is a major problem. It is hoped that relevant departments will strengthen the management of market prices. Wang Boping

    要防止轮番涨价的现象
    九江市的有些物价上涨，是不合理的。例如去年4、5月份，每担松柴价八角，现在涨到一元八角；木炭原来每担二元左右，现在是四元八角；青菜原来是三、四分钱一斤，现在一般青菜都是一角左右一斤。理发，过去一次是二角，现在是三角。洗澡盆浴，由原来的三角涨到四角；池浴由一角五分涨到二角。
    这么多东西都涨了价，似乎粮食也应该涨价，否则将会造成谷贱伤农。这样势必造成轮番涨价，这就是大问题了。希望有关部门加强对市场物价的管理。　王伯平
