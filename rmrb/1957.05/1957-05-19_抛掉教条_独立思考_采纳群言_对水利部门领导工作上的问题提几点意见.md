Throw Away Dogma, Think Independently, Adopt Collective Wisdom
    ——Some Suggestions on the Work of Leaders in the Water Conservancy Department
                        Zhang Hanying
    The Party's rectification movement has already begun. I would like to offer some suggestions on some issues in water conservancy work that I can think of at the moment.
    I believe the following aspects of water conservancy construction work should be studied and improved:

    Summarizing Mass Experience and Historical Experience Cannot Just Stay at the Level of Slogans
    First, we should earnestly, and not just at the level of slogans, summarize mass experience, historical experience, and the experience gained in practice in recent years.
    Our people have rich experience in fighting floods and droughts, but we have neglected this in the past, believing that past hydraulic structures were not as tall and large as they are now, the hydrology was not recorded and calculated in detail, the methods were not scientific enough, and the technology was backward. Therefore, we do not value our country's historical experience and the creations of the working people. We mostly move foreign experiences and find solutions from foreign books. Of course, this is necessary, but it is not comprehensive.
    In recent years, China's water conservancy cause has made great progress. Whether in hydraulic structures or water control strategies, as well as the actual benefits obtained, there have been achievements. This is the main aspect. Of course, there are also shortcomings in the work. These experiences have all grown out of China's actual situation and are very valuable to us. We should summarize and promote them in a timely manner. However, very little has been done. Every year, only administrative work summaries are made, and there are few scientific and technological summaries, as well as few scientific and technological discussions. It is often thought that there is a shortage of technical personnel, and it is urgent to do the next job, treating summarizing experience as something that can be done when "there is surplus energy." Therefore, although exchanging experience is regarded as one of the tasks, it only stays at the level of slogans because the summary of experience is not done enough. This is very detrimental to the training of technical personnel, the promotion of scientific research, and the popularization of advanced experience, resulting in losses in work.
    In terms of water disasters, there are floods and waterlogging disasters. Farmers know this. "Waterlogging" and "internal flooding" are not new terms. However, our technical cadres have not learned about them in the past. When talking about water disasters, they think of rivers and always start with river management. In the second year after the completion of the Xin沂 River in the Huaiyin area of Jiangsu, a bumper harvest was achieved in an area with tens of millions of mu of water disasters every year, and it was believed that this was the effect of the Yi River management. In fact, this is only half correct. In recent years, the river channels in this area have not breached, but there are still several million mu of waterlogging every year. That year's bumper harvest was due to the relatively dry weather and not much waterlogging. This is just one example. The lessons of serious facts in various places have made us understand the threat of waterlogging. If we can go deep into the masses and analyze the causes of water disasters, wouldn't we be able to manage them earlier and reduce losses? History has long recorded the system of ditches. At that time, the economic and cultural center was still in the Yellow River basin. What exactly was the ancient ditch system like, and what was its role? Have we, who are engaged in water conservancy work, considered it?
    Our larger construction sites often have teachers from schools leading students to practice and stay for a long time, which is good. Can these textbooks be moved to the classroom? What is now taught in the classroom are unfamiliar place names, unfamiliar natural conditions, and descriptions that are relatively far from their own lives. A large number of personnel from other engineering units often come to the major construction sites to learn on the spot, which is also good. If systematic summaries are transmitted to various places in a timely manner, wouldn't the effect be better! The exchange of experience in some construction sites is relatively good. However, some regions are using relatively backward design experience and construction methods at the same time. Therefore, summarizing the experience of China's current engineering measures is important and of great significance.

    Moving Foreign Dogmas at Every Turn Lacks the Spirit of Independent Thinking
    Secondly, we should analyze problems specifically based on China's actual situation and move less dogma. Because China's science and technology are relatively backward, scientific and technological personnel are mostly directly or indirectly influenced by some foreign countries. It is good to learn advanced experience. However, there is often a tendency to move dogma. This also affects water control strategies and plans.
    Our design standards for hydraulic structures have not been finalized. China's rainfall situation has its own characteristics, which affects the characteristics of water flow changes. Our hydrological observation data is also relatively lacking, and the components that rely on estimation and calculation are relatively large. The design of our important buildings is based on foreign standards, with a once-in-a-thousand-year flood as the defense object and a once-in-ten-thousand-year flood as the check. The water flow changes in China's general rivers are very large. The difference between a once-in-a-hundred-year flood and a once-in-a-thousand-year or once-in-ten-thousand-year flood is very large. If it is possible to take defending against a once-in-a-hundred-year flood as the standard, but due to lack of in-depth research, a once-in-a-thousand-year flood is adopted, the investment will increase a lot. This is one aspect.
    Because our hydrological data is lacking, we often rely on estimation. According to the calculation methods currently used, the accuracy is not high. For example, a difference of 10%-20% is considered very approximate. Everyone knows that due to such a difference, the investment is not small. This is another aspect.
    The solution to this problem is naturally not easy. There should be a thorough and detailed research work, or a considerable amount of manpower and time should be invested. However, opposing dogma must also have a foundation, and these problems are often related to the safety of national construction and investment. The matter is very important and should be promoted as an important issue to formulate design standards suitable for China's situation and study the laws of water flow in China.
    This is just one example. There are many similar examples. Due to the needs of work development, we often only seek to have a tool or method to complete the task in a hurry, moving foreign books or quoting someone's remarks at every turn, and lacking the spirit of independent thinking and analyzing specific situations. The particularity of the problems of eliminating water hazards and developing water conservancy is very large, and the requirements for specific analysis of individual problems are also high. Although we have made some achievements in water conservancy, there are many problems. This is mainly due to the lack of in-depth research in all aspects. We cannot only look at the achievements. These achievements are also often something that many water conservancy workers are proud of. We should deeply examine the shortcomings of moving dogma. Our situation in this regard is serious. I believe that this examination can improve work, save funds, and create conditions for scientific research to catch up with the world's advanced level.

    Strong Bureaucratic Atmosphere and Weak Academic Atmosphere The Water Conservancy Department Does Not Hear "鳴" (Ming) Sounds
    Third, the water conservancy department has a strong bureaucratic atmosphere and a weak academic atmosphere. No voices are heard. Water conservancy is a department of economic construction, but it involves a wide range and complex content. Therefore, there are many scientific research problems. We are in a time of transition, and we are also in a period of rapid development. We have old experience, new experience, and foreign experience, but we have not yet formed a set of experience suitable for the modern situation. Due to the rapid development of the cause, new problems are constantly being raised. Therefore, our disputes should be many, but they are very quiet. Since there are these problems, how are they handled? They are mostly handled by administrative methods. Although there are different opinions, a conclusion is reached in one or several administrative meetings after the different opinions are raised. Due to the urgent needs of the work, it is sometimes necessary to make a decision first. But the problem is that research and debate are not encouraged. For example, after determining which year's flood type or what frequency should be used as the standard for the management of a certain river, everything is fine. In fact, the problem has not been solved, and the designers are still in doubt. But when planning the management of another river, the same method is still used until a problem occurs or someone suggests a new method, and then they think about it again and make another decision. Although they also repeatedly ask for research, they have not actually advocated research in their leadership methods. A few years ago, the Ministry of Water Conservancy had a publication called "People's Water Conservancy." They were always afraid of problems in their remarks and restricted it very tightly. The leadership seemed to regard it as a burden and discontinued it during a newspaper rectification opportunity.
    The situation has changed somewhat now, and attention has been paid to academic discussions. However, it can only be said that attention has been paid, and there is still a distance from expanding it. A spirit of contention has not yet been developed. This aspect should be worked hard by scientific and technological personnel. On the one hand, it should also be improved from the leadership aspect and vigorously advocated.

    Why Are You So Unconcerned About Political Study in the Senior Group?
    Fourth, we should pay more attention to the political study of cadres, especially the political study of the senior group within the Ministry of Water Conservancy. It is difficult to understand why they are so unconcerned about the political study of senior cadres. We have a senior group, and after the central government has set a study plan, we send a copy of it. But it only stops there. In recent years, the senior group has not studied collectively, nor has it held meetings to discuss, nor has it checked the learning situation of each person. They have not even asked a question with concern, nor have they organized an inspirational report. Several opinions have been raised, but there has been no improvement, nor has there been an explanation. In recent years, it has become worse than in previous years. But when they encounter a movement, they are still relatively serious. Although the time is still the same time for study, they can still hold meetings as usual. This shows that the order for a task can be followed. However, they are not concerned enough about regular and very important study, which is related to the ideological transformation and progress of cadres.
    It is still the same for political study that is set as a system, and other matters about study need not be said.
    But this does not mean that the progress of water conservancy scientific and technological workers is very poor. Generally, they can accept the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and study hard, learn in vivid practical activities, and study theoretical books, and their ideological level has been improved. The problem lies in the speed of improvement and whether they can adapt to the requirements of social development. This depends on the Party's constant concern and education. Whether the potential and enthusiasm of water conservancy workers can be brought into play is closely related to their political consciousness and ideological methods. Everyone knows this, and everyone knows that their enthusiasm is good for work. Although they often call for doing a good job and bringing into play their enthusiasm, they are not concerned enough about the political study of cadres.
    My accusations here may be a bit excessive, because various movements are learning, and participating in production practice is also learning. I seem to attach too much importance to the form of learning. I think that if there is this form, it should play its role, otherwise, change this form.

    We should Listen to Opinions from All Sides on the Issue of the Water Conservancy Organization System
    In addition, I think there are two points that should be considered in the system. The first is the central leadership organization for soil and water conservation. The importance and complexity of soil and water conservation work have been reported and discussed a lot in the newspapers. This work is related to agricultural production in mountainous and hilly areas, and it is related to river management. This is a comprehensive work related to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy projects. After discovering the comprehensive nature of this work in 1953, it was suggested that the central government set up a management agency, which was adopted in principle, and the form of establishment was considered. Although I often hear news, "I only hear the sound of footsteps upstairs, but I don't see anyone coming down."
    The situation reflected in the work and the newspapers shows that this unified organization is still very necessary. Soil and water conservation is a mass work that must rely on the local area, it is a comprehensive work that must involve the participation of relevant departments, it is a scientific research work, and the guiding principles and methods of the work are still being explored, and more unified leadership is needed to exchange experience. Due to historical reasons and also due to needs, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has done some work and is also interested. Therefore, this work was first noticed by the water conservancy department. In fact, this work is almost presided over by the water conservancy department. The water conservancy department has also requested other business departments to preside over it, but no agreement has been reached. At the same time, the cooperation of various business departments has also been insufficient in recent years. Due to the importance of the matter, several provinces in the Yellow River basin have respectively established soil and water conservation bureaus, which shows the importance of the matter and the importance attached by the local government. The provinces have promoted some work and have also achieved some results. But it is said that recently some soil and water conservation bureaus are going to be abolished or have been abolished. I don't think this means that the matter is not important, it may be that the development of the work is abnormal. The newspaper has caused a debate on whether to treat gullies first or surfaces first, whether to treat biological first or engineering first, or how to combine them. Some said that the work in recent years has achieved results, and some said that there are no results. Some are dissatisfied with the leadership of the engineering department, but other departments are unwilling to take the lead. Now the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub has started construction, but there is still no unified opinion on the issue of reservoir siltation. Soil and water conservation work is not only important in the Loess Plateau, but all regions have problems of varying degrees. This is a new work and a comprehensive work. The leadership of it should be considered and resolved as soon as possible.
    The second is the division of labor of water conservancy work under the State Council. Water conservancy work belongs to the nature of capital construction and serves flood control, irrigation, power, shipping, and other departments. In terms of the departments served, it can be managed separately by various economic departments. China has done this before, and foreign countries still do this. However, due to the development of modern water conservancy and the changes in the social system, the comprehensive utilization of water flow has become the guiding ideology of water management. The comprehensive utilization of water flow is to serve various economic departments after the water flow is controlled to achieve the highest comprehensive benefits. This is one aspect. In order to control water flow, there must be large buildings, such as dams or sluice gates. The flood control department needs this type of construction, and other departments also need this type of construction. If they are managed separately, each department must have a set of such research forces, design forces, and construction forces. When designing buildings, each department must consider comprehensive utilization, so they must conduct consultations, but this is an important link in the "internal contradiction" and often causes disputes. If this type of work is managed by one department, there may be benefits in terms of manpower saving and work coordination.
    If it is believed that hydropower management should be led by the industrial department, irrigation management should be led by the agricultural department, and flood defense should be led by another department, I think it is also appropriate for a department to be in charge of water conservancy capital construction, that is, large-scale hydraulic engineering construction and comprehensive utilization of water sources should be led by one department.
    There may be different opinions on this issue. I think we should listen to opinions from all sides, consider this issue, and seek a more reasonable solution.

    抛掉教条　独立思考　采纳群言
    ——对水利部门领导工作上的问题提几点意见
                        张含英
    党的整风运动已经开始，就我一时想起的水利工作上的一些问题提一些意见。
    我认为在水利建设工作方面应当研究改进的有以下几点：
    总结群众经验历史经验  不能只是停留在口号上
    首先，应当认真地、而不是停留在口号上，总结群众经验、历史经验、最近几年在实践中的经验。
    我国人民有同水旱灾害斗争的丰富经验，可是我们过去却忽视了这一点，认为过去的水工建筑物没有现在的高大，水文没有详细的记载和计算，方法不够科学，技术落后，因之不重视我国历史的经验和劳动人民的创造。我们现在大都搬运外来的经验，从外国书本里找办法。当然这是必要的，但不是全面的。
    几年来，我国的水利事业有很大的发展，无论在水工建筑物上或治水方略上，以及实际所得的效益都是有成绩的。这是主要的。当然在工作上也有错误的一面。这些经验都是在我国实际生长起来的，对我们说是很宝贵的，应当及时地总结推广。但是作的很少，每年只作些行政工作的总结，很少有科学技术总结，也少有科学技术讨论。常认为技术干部缺少，赶做下一个工作要紧，把总结经验看作是“行有余力”的事情。所以虽然把交流经验当为工作的一项，但是由于总结经验做的不够，所以交流经验也只停留在口号上。因而对于技术干部的训练，对于促进科学的研究，对于先进经验的推广都很不利，在工作上造成了损失。
    就水灾说，有洪水灾害和沥水灾害之分，农民都是知道的。“沥水”和“内涝”并不是新名词。可是我们技术干部过去没学过，谈到水灾就想到河道，总是先从河道治理下手。江苏淮阴专区在新沂河修成的次年，在每年有上千万亩水灾的地区得到了丰收，便认为这是沂河治理的效果，其实这只对了一半。近年来这一地区河道没有决口，但每年却仍有涝灾几百万亩。那年的丰收是由于比较旱，沥水不多的缘故。这只是一个例子。各地严重事实的教训，才使我们了解涝灾的威胁。设若我们能深入群众，分析水灾的原因，不是可以早些治理，减轻损失么？历史上早就记载着沟洫的制度，那时的经济文化中心还在黄河流域，古代沟洫制度究竟怎样，什么作用，我们从事水利工作的人考虑过么？
    我们较大的工地经常有学校的教师率领着学生实习，住较久的时间，这是好的。这些教材是否可以搬到教室上去呢？而现在在教室上所教的都是不熟悉的地名，生疏的自然情况，和自己生活比较远的描写。各大工地也常有大批的其他工程单位的人员实地学习，这也是好的。设若有有系统的总结及时地传达到各处，效果岂不更好！有些工地的经验交流是比较好的，但是，也有些地区却在同时采用着较落后的设计经验和施工方法。所以总结我国当前的工程措施的经验是重要的，意义很大。
    动辄搬运外国教条  缺少独立思考精神
    其次，应当根据我国实际情况，具体分析问题，少搬教条。由于我国的科学技术比较落后，科学技术人员大都直接或间接受到一些外国的影响。学习先进经验，这是好的。但却常常产生了搬运教条的趋向。因而也就影响到治水的方略和计划。
    我们水工建筑物的设计标准一直没定下来。我国的降雨情况有它的特点，因而影响到水流变化的特点。我们的水文观测资料也比较缺少，依赖估计推算的成分比较多。我们的重要建筑物的设计就按国外的标准，以千年一遇的洪水为防御对象，用万年一遇的洪水为校核。我国一般河道的水流变化是很大的，百年一遇的洪水与千年或万年一遇的洪水相差很大，设若是可以以防御百年一遇的洪水为标准，由于没深入研究，而采用了千年一遇的，就要增加投资很多。这是一面。
    由于我们的水文资料缺少，常依赖推算。按现在所用的计算方法，准确性不高。例如相差10％—20％，就算很近似了。大家知道由于这样的差别，投资是不小的。这又是一面。
    这个问题的解决自然不是容易的，应当有一番周密详尽的研究工作，或需要投入相当多的人力和时间，但是反对教条也必须有基础，而这些问题又常是关系国家建设的安全和投资，事情很重要，应该当作一个重要问题来推进，制定出适合我国情况的设计标准，研究出我国水流的规律。
    这只是一个例子，同类的例子很多。由于工作发展的需要，我们常常只求得有个工具或方法，匆忙地来完成任务，动辄搬运外国书本或引用某人言论，而缺少独立思考、分析具体情况的精神。除水害、兴水利问题中的特殊性很大，个别问题要作具体分析的要求也高。我们水利事业上虽有些成就，而问题却很多。主要由于对于各方面的研究不深不透。我们不能只看成绩，这些成绩也是许多水利工作者常引以自豪的，我们应该深刻地检查搬运教条的缺点，我们在这方面的情况是严重的。我认为从这个检查可以改善工作，节约资金，也为科学研究赶上世界先进水平创造条件。
    机关味浓，学术味淡  水利部门不闻“鸣”声
    第三，水利部门的机关气息很浓，学术味道淡薄，听不到鸣声。水利是经济建设的一个部门，但是它牵扯的面很广，内容复杂，所以科学研究的问题也很多。我们正在青黄不接的时间，也正在迅速发展的时期，我们有老经验、有新经验、有外国经验，但是还没有形成一套适合于现代形势的经验，又由于事业的发展迅速，新问题又不断提出。因此，我们的争论应该是很多的，但却很沉寂。既然有这些问题，是怎样处理的呢？大都用行政的方法处理。虽然有不同意见，但在不同意见提出以后，在一次或几次行政性的会议上就得出结论了。由于工作的迫切需要，先拿个主意有时也是需要的。但问题在于并不提倡研究和争论。例如，某河的治理应该以那年洪水型或什么频率为标准，定了以后就万事大吉。实际上问题并没解决，设计的人仍在怀疑。但是在计划另一个河道的治理时，却仍然采用同一种方法，一直到发生了问题，或者有人建议新方法，才又思考一番，另作一个决定。虽然也口口声声要求研究，实际在领导方法上却没有提倡研究。几年前水利部曾有“人民水利”一个刊物，总怕言论上出问题，限制的很紧，领导上似乎看作一个包袱，在一个整顿报刊的机会，就停刊了。
    现在情况有些转变，注意了学术的讨论。但是也只能说注意了，离展开还有距离，还没有养成争鸣的风气。这一方面应由科学技术人员努力，一方面还应从领导方面改进，并大力倡导。
    对高级组政治学习为什么这样不关心？
    第四，应当更关心干部的政治学习，我说的特别是水利部内的高级组的政治学习。很难理解为什么对于高级干部的政治学习这样不关心。我们有个高级组，在中央定了学习计划以后，照转一份。但是仅止于此。近几年高级组没有集体学习过，也没有开会讨论过，没有检查过各人学习的情况，连关心地问一问都没有，也没组织过启发报告。提过几次意见，没有改善，也没有说明。近几年反而比前几年更差。但是遇到一个运动还是比较认真的，时间虽然还是学习的同一时间，但能照常开会。这说明对于一项任务的命令是能遵守的。但是对于经常的、很重要的学习，也就是关系着干部们思想改造和进步的事，却不够关心。
    对于定为制度的政治学习还是这样，其他关于学习的事就更不必说了。
    但是这不等于说水利科学技术工作者的进步很差。一般地能接受马克思列宁主义的思想，而且努力地学习，在活生生的实际活动里学习，在研读着理论的书籍，思想水平有所提高。问题在于提高的快慢，在于是否能适应社会发展的要求。这就有待于党的经常关心和教育。能否发挥水利工作者的潜力和积极性，这同他们的政治觉悟和思想方法有密切关系，这是谁都知道的，他们的积极性对于工作有好处，也是谁都知道的。虽然经常号召把工作作好，要发挥积极性，但是对于干部的政治学习却是不够关心的。
    我这里的指责可能过火了一些，因为各项运动是学习，参加生产实践也是学习，我似乎太重视学习的形式了。我认为有这个形式就应当发挥它的作用，否则就改变这种形式。
    关于水利机构体制问题应该倾听各方面的意见
    另外，我认为在体制上还有应考虑的两点。第一是关于水土保持的中央领导机构。水土保持工作的重要性和复杂性报纸上有过很多报道和讨论。这一工作关系着山区、丘陵区的农业生产，关系着河道的治理；这是一个关系着农业、林业、畜牧业、水利工程的综合性的工作。在1953年发现这个工作的综合性以后，就建议中央设立一个管理机构，原则上受到采纳，并且考虑设立的形式。虽然时常听到风声雨声，但是“只听楼梯响，不见人下来。”
    从工作中和报纸上所反映的情况，可见这个统筹机构仍是很需要的。水土保持是一个群众性的工作，必须依靠地方，是一个综合性的工作，必须有关各部门的参予，是一个科学研究工作，对于工作的方针和方法还在摸索，更需要统一的领导，以便交流经验。这一工作由于历史的关系，也是由于需要的关系，黄河水利委员曾作了一些工作，也有兴致。因之这一工作首先受到水利部门的注意，实际上这一工作几乎由水利部门主持了。水利部门也曾请求其他业务部门主持，没有得到协议。同时，这几年各业务部门的配合也是不够的。由于事情的重要，黄河流域的几个省曾分别成立了水土保持局，可见事情的重要和地方的重视。各省曾推动了一些工作，也有些成绩。但是据说，最近有的水土保持局要撤销或已撤销了。我认为这并不是表示事情不重要，可能是工作发展的不正常。报上对于应当先治沟或是先治面，先生物或先工程，或是怎样结合，曾引起争论。有的说这几年的工作有成绩，有的说没成绩。有的不满意于工程部门的领导，但其他部门又不愿出来承担领导。现在三门峡水利枢纽开工了，但对于水库的淤积问题仍没有统一的意见。水土保持工作不仅在黄土高原重要，各地区都轻重不同地有问题。这是一项新工作，又是综合性的工作，对于它的领导应当及早考虑解决。
    第二是国务院下水利工作的分工问题。水利工作属于基本建设性质，为防洪、灌溉、电力、航运及其他部门服务。就所服务的部门说，可以由各经济部门分别管理，我国从前这样作过，外国现在也还有这样作的。不过由于近代水利事业的发展，由于社会制度的改变，水流的综合利用已经成为治水的指导思想。水流的综合利用是在水流被控制以后，为各经济部门服务，以达到最高的综合效益。这是一面。为了控制水流常须有大建筑物，或是大坝，或是大闸。防洪部门需要这类建筑，其他部门也需要这类建筑。如若各别管理，各部门都须有一套这样的研究力量、设计力量、施工力量。各部门在设计建筑物时必需要考虑综合利用，因之就须要进行协商，但这却又是“内部矛盾”的一个重要环节，常常引起争执。如若这类工作由一个部主管，在人力节约上，工作配合上可能都有好处。
    如果认为水电管理应由工业部门领导，灌溉管理应由农业部门领导，水灾防御应由另一部门领导，我认为有一个部主管水利基本建设也是适当的，就是大型水工建筑和水源综合利用应由一个部门领导。
    关于这个问题可能有不同的意见。我认为应该倾听各方面的意见，应该考虑这个问题，求得更合理的解决。
