　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th Dispatch: In a reply to Ogata Shoji, a permanent director of the Japanese Peace Committee, on the issue of banning nuclear weapons tests, Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said that the Soviet government is ready to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons as soon as the United States and Britain agree to undertake similar obligations.

　　Bulganin assured Ogata Shoji that the Soviet government will continue to take all possible measures to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to take striving for the cessation of tests of such weapons as the first step in this regard.

　　Moscow newspapers today published Ogata Shoji's letter and Bulganin's reply of May 7.

　　In his letter, Ogata Shoji expressed that the Japanese people cannot agree that the British are justified in conducting nuclear weapons tests near Christmas Island under the pretext of defending against "the threat of attack."

　　The Japanese Peace Committee has requested the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee in London to conclude an agreement on the prohibition of testing atomic explosions, and demanded that nuclear weapons tests be stopped before the conclusion of this agreement. Ogata Shoji believes that the conclusion of such an agreement will open the way for the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons, and therefore requests the Soviet government to continue to take effective measures to strive for the conclusion of such an international agreement.

　　The Japanese Peace Committee has sent letters with the same content to Macmillan and Eisenhower respectively.

　　Bulganin's reply also reviewed the Soviet government's past proposals on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which were not only not supported by the governments of countries possessing atomic weapons and certain other countries, but were not even supported by Japan at the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly. Bulganin expressed regret about this.

　　Bulganin's letter went on to say that, as a result, the Western countries' refusal to support the Soviet proposal has become the reason why no agreement has been reached to this day on the immediate prohibition of testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th Dispatch: In a speech at the Disarmament Committee Subcommittee meeting on May 8, the Soviet representative Zorin critically analyzed the British proposal on the issue of nuclear tests, and once again insisted on immediately resolving the issue of completely stopping or temporarily suspending the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　The Soviet representative pointed out that the British memorandum did not put forward any proposals conducive to resolving the cessation or temporary suspension of nuclear weapons tests. The British suggestion is that countries possessing atomic weapons - the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain - now set about formulating a system for pre-registering atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons tests. Britain also suggested establishing a committee of experts to study the possibility of limiting the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

　　Finally, the proposal put forward by Noble mentioned that experimental nuclear explosions could only be stopped after the production of military fissionable materials was prohibited as part of a general disarmament agreement. Zorin pointed out that, therefore, the main content of the new British proposal is no different from the proposals put forward by Canada, Japan, and Norway at the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, namely, it is limited to pre-announcing the registration of nuclear explosion tests.

　　Zorin said that registering tests and exchanging observers actually legalizes testing and the atomic arms race.

　　The proposal to register explosions and observe explosions can only create an illusion in international public opinion, as if steps are already being taken to solve the problem according to the line of the Disarmament Subcommittee.

　　Zorin said that the Soviet delegation cannot participate in steps that can only mislead international public opinion and cannot promote the solution of this problem in the slightest. We believe that the Disarmament Subcommittee, first and foremost the countries possessing nuclear weapons, must make every effort to solve the problem of stopping or temporarily suspending nuclear tests without delay.

### 苏联主张坚决禁止核武器  布尔加宁告诉尾形昭二苏联准备随时停止试验  佐林在裁军小组会议上指出英国建议混淆视听

    苏联主张坚决禁止核武器
    布尔加宁告诉尾形昭二苏联准备随时停止试验
    佐林在裁军小组会议上指出英国建议混淆视听
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，在就禁止试验核武器问题给日本和平委员会常任理事尾形昭二的复信中说，一俟美国和英国同意承担类似义务的时候，苏联政府准备停止原子武器和氢武器的试验。
    布尔加宁向尾形昭二保证，苏联政府将继续采取它所能做到的一切措施争取禁止原子武器，并且以争取停止这类武器的试验作为这方面的第一步。
    莫斯科各报今天刊载了尾形昭二的来信和布尔加宁5月7日的复信。
    尾形昭二在他的来信中表示，日本人民不能同意英国人借口防御“进攻的威胁”而在圣诞岛附近进行核武器试验是正当的。
    日本和平委员会已经请求伦敦的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会就禁止试验原子核爆炸的问题缔结协定，并且要求在这个协定缔结以前停止试验核武器。尾形昭二认为，缔结这样的协定将为全面禁止核武器打开道路，因此请求苏联政府继续采取有效措施来争取缔结这样的国际协定。
    日本和平委员会已经将同样内容的信件分别寄给麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔。
    布尔加宁的复信还回溯了苏联政府过去提出的关于禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议，这些建议不但没有得到持有原子武器国家和某些其它国家的政府的支持，甚至在第十一届联合国大会上也没有得到日本的支持。布尔加宁对此表示遗憾。
    布尔加宁的信接着说，这样一来，西方国家拒绝支持苏联的建议，就成了直到今天还没有能在立即禁止试验原子武器和氢武器方面达成协议的原因。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社伦敦9日讯：苏联代表佐林5月8日在裁军委员会小组委员会会议的发言中批判地分析了英国关于原子核试验问题的建议，并且再次坚持立即解决完全停止或者暂时中止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。
    苏联代表指出，英国的备忘录没有提出任何有利于解决停止或者暂时中止核武器试验的主张。英国的建议是，拥有原子武器的国家——美国、苏联和英国——现在着手制定一个预先登记原子武器和氢武器试验的制度。英国还建议建立一个专家委员会，以研究限制试验原子武器和氢武器的可能性的问题。
    最后，诺布尔所提出的建议中说到只有在禁止生产军用分裂物质以作为普遍裁军协定中的组成部分以后，才能停止试验性的原子核爆炸。佐林指出，因此，英国新建议的主要内容同加拿大、日本和挪威在联合国大会第十一届会议上提出的建议没有两样，即仅限于预告登记原子核爆炸试验而已。
    佐林说，登记试验和交换观察员实际上就是使试验和原子军备竞赛合法化。
    登记爆炸和观察爆炸的建议只能在国际舆论间造成一种错觉，仿佛已经根据裁军小组委员会的路线在采取步骤来解决问题了。
    佐林说，苏联代表团不能参与这种只能把国际舆论引入迷途而丝毫不能促进这个问题的解决的步骤。我们认为，裁军小组委员会，首先是拥有核武器的国家，必须尽一切努力，刻不容缓地解决停止或暂时停止原子核试验的问题。
