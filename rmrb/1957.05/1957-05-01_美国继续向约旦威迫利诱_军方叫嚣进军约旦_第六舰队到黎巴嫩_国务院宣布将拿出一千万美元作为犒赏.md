Combined reports from our newspaper: The United States is further exerting military threats and economic bait on Jordan, in order to support the conspirators and intimidate the Jordanian people.

According to Washington reports: U.S. Army Secretary Bruck stated on television on the evening of April 29th that the United States is "watching and waiting" for "any development" in the Near East and that, "if necessary," the United States can move troops into Jordan in "a matter of days."

According to Beirut reports: Six warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet arrived off the coast of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on the morning of the 30th. Two more destroyers are scheduled to arrive in Beirut on May 2nd.

On the same day that Bruck clamored for marching into Jordan, U.S. State Department spokesman White announced that the United States was "ready soon" to give Jordan $10 million in "aid" for "economic development and political stability." He said this was a "reward" for the King of Jordan's suppression of leftists.

White said the money was requested by Jordan last week. Jordan can use it "very freely," including to maintain the Jordanian army.

White also said that "if necessary," the United States is prepared to provide "aid" in addition to this $10 million "aid."

Egyptian newspapers continue to condemn U.S. interference in Jordan's internal affairs. The newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial on April 29 regarding the activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, stating that imperialists believe they can use intervention to force the Jordanian people to agree to put on handcuffs again, even though the Jordanian people have already thwarted similar attempts by Templer and Glubb. The Jordanian people will never agree to be tied to the chariot of imperialism by others.

"Al-Ahram" protested the upcoming discussion of the Middle East issue by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, led by the United States. The newspaper said, "We want to tell American politicians and the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Arab affairs should only be handled by Arabs."

    美国继续向约旦威迫利诱
    军方叫嚣进军约旦  第六舰队到黎巴嫩
    国务院宣布将拿出一千万美元作为犒赏
    本报综合报道  美国又进一步对约旦施行军事威胁和经济诱饵，以支持阴谋分子而恐吓约旦人民。
    据华盛顿消息：美国陆军部长布鲁克4月29日晚上在电视广播中说，美国对中近东的“任何局势发展都在注视着和等待着”，“如果需要的话”，美国能够在“几天中”就把军队开进约旦。
    另据贝鲁特消息：美国第六舰队的六艘军舰已经在30日上午到达黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特海面。另外两艘驱逐舰预定在5月2日到达贝鲁特。
    在布鲁克叫嚣进军约旦的同一天，美国国务院发言人怀特宣布，美国“准备很快”就给约旦一千万美元的“援助”，供“发展经济和稳定政治”之用。他说，这是对约旦国王镇压左翼分子的“酬答”。
    怀特说，这笔钱是约旦在上星期要求给予的。约旦可以“非常自由地”使用，包括用来维持约旦军队在内。
    怀特还说，“如果有必要”，美国准备在这一千万美元“援助”以外再提供“援助”。
    埃及报纸继续谴责美国干涉约旦内政。“人民报”4月29日就美国第六舰队的活动发表社论说，帝国主义者认为，他们可以靠干涉来迫使约旦人民同意重新戴上手铐，尽管约旦人民已经挫败了田普勒和格拉布的类似的企图。约旦人民决不会同意让别人把他们束缚在帝国主义的战车上。
    “金字塔报”对以美国为首的北大西洋公约组织理事会即将讨论中东问题一事提出抗议。这家报纸说，“我们希望告诉美国政治家和北大西洋公约组织的领袖们，阿拉伯事务只应该由阿拉伯人处理”。
