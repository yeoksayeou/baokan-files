Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, at a meeting held on the 3rd and 4th, made a plan to launch a rectification movement within all levels of Party organizations in the city.

The Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee decided that this rectification movement should first start with studying documents. A certain amount of time should be used to further study and discuss Chairman Mao's speeches and the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement within all levels of Party organizations in the city. Then, in light of the actual situation, work should be reviewed. In the study, it is advocated to boldly expose thoughts,展开争论(zhǎnkāi zhēnglùn), enhance understanding, and solve problems. In order to facilitate discussion, various departments should be divided into groups according to different levels. Non-Party members can participate freely. The Standing Committee believes that the success of the rectification of the Standing Committee members of the Municipal Party Committee and the leading Party cadres of municipal-level organs, large factories, and universities is the key to the success of the rectification of Party organizations throughout the city.

The rectification plan made by the Standing Committee requires the Municipal Party Committee and relevant departments to investigate, study, and analyze the contradictions in factories, enterprises, schools, rural areas, and other aspects in combination with daily work during the rectification, and summarize some specific experiences in handling contradictions among the people. For problems that have already been raised, in accordance with the spirit of checking and solving simultaneously, those that can be solved should be solved immediately and should not be waited for or delayed. At the same time, the secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee and the leading Party cadres of various departments should take concrete measures to immediately expand contact with the masses, and take the initiative to contact Party members, non-Party cadres, and the broad masses of workers and peasants. The Municipal Party Committee is preparing to hold various forms of symposiums or take individual heart-to-heart talks to listen to the opinions of Party members, non-Party cadres, and the masses.

The Standing Committee also studied the issue of main leaders participating in physical labor for part of their time, such as participating in voluntary labor for urban construction, participating in cleaning and sanitation work in streets, offices, and dormitories, and participating in afforestation work. Then, the system and methods of participating in industrial and agricultural production will be further studied.

The meeting decided to establish a leading group headed by the secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat to lead the city's rectification movement. At the same time, it was decided that various departments should establish leading groups and lists of group members to be responsible for leading the rectification of their respective departments.

    北京市委要求在整风中
    大胆暴露思想展开争论
    新华社5日讯　中共北京市委常委会在3、4两日召开的会议上，作出了在全市各级党组织内开展整风运动的计划。
    市委常委会决定这次整风运动首先从学习文件入手，用一定的时间，在全市各级党组织内进一步深入地学习和讨论毛主席的讲话和中央关于整风运动的指示，然后结合实际，检查工作。在学习中，提倡大胆暴露思想，展开争论，提高认识，解决问题。为了便于讨论，各部门要按不同水平，分别编组。党外人士可以自由参加。　　常委会认为，市委常委会成员和市级机关、大工厂、高等学校的党员领导干部的整风进行得好坏，是全市党组织整风进行得好坏的关键。
    常委会作出的整风计划中，要求市委和各有关部门，在整风中结合日常工作，调查、研究和分析工厂、企业、学校、农村等各方面的矛盾，总结一些处理人民内部矛盾的具体经验；对于已经提出来的问题，根据边检查边解决的精神，能够解决的就立即解决，不应该等待和拖延。同时，市委书记处和各部门的党员领导干部，都要采取具体措施，立即扩大同群众的联系，主动地接触党内外的干部和广大工农群众。市委最近准备召开各种形式的座谈会或采取个别谈心方式，听取党内外干部和群众的意见。
    常委会还研究了主要领导人员以一部分时间参加体力劳动的问题。如参加城市建设的义务劳动，参加街道、机关、宿舍的清洁卫生工作，参加植树造林工作等。然后，进一步研究参加工农业生产的制度和办法。
    会议决定成立以市委书记处书记为主的领导小组，领导全市的整风运动；同时决定了各部门分别成立领导小组和小组成员名单，负责本部门整风的领导。
