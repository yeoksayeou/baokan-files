    Niannu Jiao
    Celebrating May Day
    Hundreds of flowers bloom, and we joyfully meet the glorious festival of the working class. In this spring breeze-kissed gathering, we all look up to the great figures of China and the Soviet Union! Our minds are in harmony with Engels and firmly adhere to Marxism-Leninism, taking leadership as our guiding principle. Promoting friendship and international solidarity among the people. Over the years, massive support and advanced construction have fundamentally driven industrialization, creating limitless new models and unprecedented miracles. Penetrating the sun with sincerity, our array pierces through the clouds, and cheers resound through the heavens: Celebrating the world, the invincible power of peace!
