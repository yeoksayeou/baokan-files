	We Must Work Harder
	(Our report) Tianjin's First Public-Private Joint Aluminum Products Factory's leading cadres led over twenty section chiefs and management personnel out of their offices to participate in labor alongside the workers.
	In April, due to the factory changing raw materials, the workers could not grasp the properties of the new materials, and the rejection rate of aluminum pots was very high. By April 15th, only 20% of the planned output had been completed. At this time, Yao Yuwen, the deputy secretary of the Party branch who understood production technology, and Wang Baochen, the deputy section chief of the production section, went deep into the workshop and convened meetings with workers according to the work flow, informing them of the production situation and mobilizing them to come up with solutions. They also worked with the workers to test and find the appropriate smoldering temperature, which reduced the occurrence of pitting and cracking in the aluminum pots. During this period, to avoid work stoppages due to lack of materials, Deputy Factory Director Li Hongquan, Deputy Manager Zhao Yuming, and others led section chiefs and management personnel to the raw material storage area, where they divided the work with the workers. Some sorted aluminum sheets and wooden boxes, some loaded vehicles, and some transported materials. The cadres' labor alongside the workers greatly moved the workers. The workers said, "Section chiefs and cadres are carrying and delivering materials, we must work even harder." As a result, the timely supply of raw materials was ensured, and the April production plan was fulfilled.

    我们更得加油了
    本报讯　天津市公私合营第一铝品制造厂领导干部，带领二十多个科长及管理人员走出办公室，去和工人一起参加劳动。
    4月间，这个厂因为更换原料，工人掌握不住原料的性能，铝锅的报废率很高，到4月15日，只完成计划的20％多。这时，懂得生产技术的党支部副书记姚玉文和生产科副科长王宝臣便深入车间，按工序召集工人开会，把生产情况告诉工人，发动大家想办法；他们还动手和工人一起试制，找出焖火的温度，使铝锅出麻点、裂纹的现象减少了。在这个期间，为了不停工待料，副厂长李鸿泉、副经理赵玉铭等带领科长和管理人员到存放原料的地方去，和工人分工合作，有的整理铝片、木箱，有的装车，有的运料。干部和工人在一起劳动使工人很受感动。工人说：“科长、干部都抬料、送料，我们更得加油干了。”因此，保证了原料的及时供应，完成了4月份的产量计划。
