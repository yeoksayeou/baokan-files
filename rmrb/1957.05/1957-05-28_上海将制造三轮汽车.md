Shanghai is preparing to utilize existing equipment to produce three-wheeled vehicles. If the problem of installation space can be solved and some key equipment is slightly increased, it can produce 5,000 three-wheeled vehicles per year. This type of three-wheeled vehicle can carry one to one and a half tons of cargo. The vehicle body is small, making it easy to drive on narrow roads, and driving is also very simple.

The production of three-wheeled vehicles will be mainly undertaken by the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory and the Shanghai Automobile Chassis Factory. These two factories and many other factories will establish cooperative relationships. This production method is completely different from the production of the Liberation truck. In order to shorten the trial production time, the three-wheeled vehicles manufactured in Shanghai will be designed based on generally produced automobile parts in Shanghai. It is expected that the three-wheeled vehicles will be able to meet the public during the "May Day" parade next year.

    上海将制造三轮汽车
    本报讯　上海市正在筹备利用现有设备生产三轮汽车，如果能解决安装场地问题，并且稍微增加一些关键性设备，就可年产三轮汽车五千辆。这种三轮汽车，可以载重一吨到一吨半的货物。车身小，便于在狭窄的道路上行驶，驾驶也很简便。
    三轮汽车的生产将主要由上海内燃机配件厂和上海汽车底盘厂负责，并由这两个厂和其他许多厂建立协作关系，这种生产的方式，是和解放牌汽车的生产完全不同的。为缩短试制时间，上海制造的三轮汽车将要根据上海一般生产的汽车配件来设计。预计在明年“五一”节游行的时候，三轮汽车就可以和群众见面。
