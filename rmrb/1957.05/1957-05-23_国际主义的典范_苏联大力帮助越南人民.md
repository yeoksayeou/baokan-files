    A Model of Internationalism
    The Soviet Union Vigorously Helps the Vietnamese People
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the tremendous and selfless assistance given by the Soviet people to the Vietnamese people has played a significant role in the economic recovery and construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    During the eight years of arduous resistance war and at the end of the war in 1954, the French army severely damaged various sectors of the Vietnamese economy, placing Vietnam in an extremely difficult situation. On July 18, 1955, the Soviet Union signed a friendly aid agreement with Vietnam aimed at helping Vietnam develop its economy and culture, providing the Vietnamese people with 400 million rubles in gratuitous aid. In 1956, the Soviet Union also granted the Democratic Republic of Vietnam a long-term loan of 30 million rubles.
    In the early days of peace restoration, in order to ensure the normal operation of Vietnam's transportation, to prevent the Nam Dinh textile factory from ceasing production, and to provide essential equipment for the Hong Gai coal mine and other industrial and mining enterprises, the Soviet people shipped large quantities of gasoline, cotton, and various machinery. Thanks to Soviet assistance, in the past two years, factories and enterprises that have been built or are about to be built on the land of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam include: the Phu Tho tea factory, the Hai Phong fish cannery, the Hanoi machine factory, the Thien Ke tin mine, the Lao Cai apatite mine, as well as power plants and water plants distributed throughout the country. The Soviet Union has also helped the Vietnamese people establish meteorological stations, radio stations, oil storage depots, and equipped state-owned construction companies and medical universities, among many other units. In addition, the Soviet Union has sent the Vietnamese people 170,000 tons of rice, 9 million meters of cloth, 5,000 tons of cotton, 1,900 tons of cotton yarn, 35 tons of paper, 50,000 tons of gasoline and kerosene, 26,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, and many medicines and small machines. These materials are worth approximately 200 million rubles.
    Between 1955 and 1956, the Soviet government and people dispatched 658 experts of various kinds to Vietnam to help the Vietnamese people carry out economic recovery and develop cultural work.

    国际主义的典范
    苏联大力帮助越南人民
    本报讯　自从印度支那和平恢复以来，苏联人民给予越南人民的巨大无私的援助，对于越南民主共和国的经济恢复和建设工作已经起了巨大的作用。
    在八年艰苦抗战过程中和在1954年战争结束时，法军曾对越南经济各部门进行了严重的破坏，使越南处于极端困难的情况。1955年7月18日，苏联即与越南签订一个目的在于帮助越南发展经济和文化的友好援助协定，给越南人民以四亿卢布的无偿援助。1956年，苏联又以长期贷款的形式贷给越南民主共和国三千万卢布。
    在和平恢复初期，为了使越南的交通得以正常运转，使南定纱厂的生产免于停顿，使鸿基煤矿等工矿企业获得必需的装备，苏联人民运来了大批汽油、棉花和各种机械。由于苏联的援助，两年来，在越南民主共和国的土地上，相继建成和即将建成的工厂企业有：富寿茶叶厂、海防鱼罐头厂、河内机器制造厂、天竺锡矿、老街磷灰石矿以及分布在各地的发电厂、自来水厂等等。苏联还帮助越南人民建立了气象台、广播电台、贮油库，装备了国营建筑公司和医科大学等许多单位。此外，苏联还给越南人民送来了十七万吨大米、九百万公尺布、五千吨棉花、一千九百吨棉纱、三十五吨纸张、五万吨汽油和煤油、二万六千吨化学肥料以及许多药品和小型机器等。这些物资约值二亿卢布。
    在1955年到1956年间，苏联政府和人民派出了六百五十八位各种专家到越南，帮助越南人民进行经济恢复和发展文化工作。
