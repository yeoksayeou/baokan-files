Medical Education and Medical Science Research Problems
——Opinions from Over Sixty Professors and Experts in the Medical Field
    (Reported by our newspaper) On the mornings of May 13th and 15th, the Ministry of Health invited over sixty professors and experts from units such as Beijing Medical College, China Union Medical College, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Medical Science Committee to a forum to discuss medical education and medical science research. The professors and experts said: The Ministry of Health has held quite a few meetings like this, and we hope that this time it will not be like the past, where the meeting is just a meeting, and after the meeting, everything remains the same. Professor Zhang Changying of Beijing Medical College said: I hope this wind can blow for a longer time. Even if it can't be like a big whirlwind that uproots trees, at least it should bend them over.
    The fundamental cause of the serious contradiction between quality and quantity in medical education lies in the subjectivism and bureaucratism of the Ministry of Health.
    Professors believe that the current serious problem in medical education is the contradiction between quality and quantity. The fundamental reasons are: First, the students entering the school have poor foundations and low quality. This is caused by the Ministry of Health's emphasis on quantity over quality. The Ministry of Health sets very high enrollment numbers for medical colleges every year, but in recent years, the source of students has been insufficient. In order to make up the numbers, those who do not meet the standards are also admitted. Bai Beiwu, Director of the People's Health Publishing House, said: Some of the new students admitted to medical colleges in 1954 had an average score of only twenty. Second, the number of students has increased, but the teaching staff, equipment, teaching bases, etc., have not kept up. The Ministry of Health rarely considers solving these problems. Professor Liu Sizhi of Beijing Medical College said: According to the current human and material resources of Beijing Medical College, the number of students should be reduced by half. Third, the academic system is short, but the courses are numerous, so that many courses cannot be taught in depth or thoroughly. Fourth, students have few opportunities to contact reality, and there are few experiments and clinical internships. What students learn in class lacks practical verification. Professor Zhang Yun of Union Medical College said: In the past, students who studied anatomy had to dissect half of a body, but now students can only dissect a little bit. Physiological internships are also done by teaching assistants, allowing students to take a look. As for clinical internships, students also have few opportunities to contact patients. Professors believe that students are not interested in "trivial" experimental operations and clinical tests, and only want to engage in theory and run to the library, which also affects quality. Fifth, leaders do not pay attention to scientific research work and do not pay attention to improving the quality of teachers. Professor Wang Zhijun of Beijing Medical College said that my past scientific research work was like "running a private business." He said that a university that does not engage in scientific research can only be regarded as a middle school. Sixth, overly detailed professional settings and premature specialization also affect quality.
    Professors believe that these are all caused by the Ministry of Health's past failure to listen to the opinions of Chinese experts, and there is serious subjectivism and bureaucratism in its work. Xu Songming said that the Ministry of Health did not grasp the business well and did not follow the mass line. Many people felt the same way.
    Professors call for extending the academic system, streamlining the curriculum, allowing students to learn to think independently, and ensuring that medical education has successors.
    Professors believe that in addition to raising the admission standards for entering students, enriching equipment, increasing teaching bases, reducing professional settings, and strengthening scientific research, the first thing to consider is extending the academic system. Zhang Yun, Liu Sizhi, and other professors called at the meeting, asking medical education to quickly restore the six-year system. They said: In the past, the academic system of medical colleges in our country was six or seven years, and the Soviet Union was also six years. Why do we now only stipulate five years for the medical department and four years for the dental department? Professor Wang Zhijun of Beijing Medical College said: The academic system is short, and there are many courses. The lectures in each subject are as concise as concentrated cod liver oil essence, with only a few points and lines, so that students' understanding of problems is very limited and their thinking ability is low. Professor Lin Qiaozhi of Union Medical College said: To cultivate talents, we must first lay the foundation. Postgraduate specialization is just building a building, not laying the foundation. If the foundation is not good, the building cannot be built. Many professors believe that traditional Chinese medicine courses are offered too early. Unsorted traditional Chinese medicine experience makes it difficult for students to distinguish the essence from the dross. It takes time, and the effect is not good. Professor Zhang Yun believes that it is necessary to teach students traditional Chinese medicine as historical knowledge, but students do not necessarily have to study Chinese medicine classics such as Neijing. As for the effective experiences summarized, they can be discussed in different subjects. Professors believe that if the extension of the academic system cannot be changed nationwide at present, it can be changed first in a few schools to cultivate a group of research talents and teachers first, otherwise, as the members of the Australian medical delegation said, China's medical education will have no successors in the future. Professors said that the extension of the academic system mainly increases the time for basic science, basic medicine, internships, and experiments. It is best to study a year or two of preparatory courses before entering the undergraduate program. The preparatory courses are best set up in the science department.
    Assign outstanding graduates to be teaching assistants and give teachers the opportunity to pursue further studies.
    Secondly, we should vigorously carry out work to improve the quality of teachers. Professor Liu Sizhi of Beijing Medical College said that in recent years, teaching methods have been improved, but the teaching content has not been improved. This is because young teachers do not have enough capital. Some excellent graduates with the potential for cultivation should be selected to work in the school. Now, good students are assigned to various places, and those with intermediate levels or those who are taken care of for health or love relationships are left behind. At the same time, those who stay in the school only focus on politics and not on business. How can the quality of teachers be good? Professor Zhang Yun also believes that we should attach importance to the work of cultivating teaching assistants. This is the source of new teachers. Professor Fang Liang of Beijing Medical College said that in the past, the Ministry of Health rarely considered the issue of further studies for lecturers and above. These people do not have time to pursue further studies, and the quality of teaching also becomes a problem. The Ministry of Health is very imprudent in preparing for and merging schools
    Professors criticized the imprudent preparation and merging of schools in the past. Xu Songming said: Four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine were established last year. I am not clear about the other three. The school buildings and equipment in Beijing are borrowed, and the teachers are pieced together. Why is a university established so hastily? May I ask what is the purpose of establishing colleges of traditional Chinese medicine? If it is said to impart traditional Chinese medicine experience, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner can take apprentices. If it is said to summarize, research, and sort out traditional Chinese medicine experience, high school students may not be able to do it. His speech was agreed upon by many people. He also said: In the past, some colleges and universities were reorganized and merged, which was obviously not well thought out. For example, the dental department of Zhejiang Medical College was one of the earliest dental departments in China, with relatively complete teachers and equipment and a long history. I don't know why these teachers were divided into various places in Northeast China and Sichuan. The dental department of Shanghai First Medical College has a shorter history than Zhejiang Medical College, and its conditions are far inferior to Zhejiang Medical College, but it was not touched. For example, the Department of Public Health of Shanxi Medical College has only one teacher, and Jiangsu Medical College has several. I don't know why Jiangsu's was merged into Shanxi. Zhu Xitao of Beijing Medical College said that the Ministry of Health should not lay eggs everywhere too early. Laying eggs everywhere will not necessarily hatch chickens. It is better to let the current chickens grow healthier. Managing only miscellaneous affairs is not enough to lead scientific research work
    Professors believe that the Ministry of Health does not pay much attention to scientific research work. The professors of Beijing Medical College said that the total scientific research funding of Beijing Medical College for the whole year is only 70,000 yuan, which is said to be the second-highest. Zhang Zhaoli, Deputy Secretary-General of the Medical Science Committee, said: The Ministry of Health's allocation of scientific research funds suffers from both scarcity and unevenness. Taking 1956 as an example, more than 40 central issues were researched in more than 30 colleges and universities across the country throughout the year, and 1 million yuan was given first. After several struggles, there was a slight increase, while the Institute of Biological Products only studied one central issue, but was allocated 700,000 yuan (it is said that it was later reduced). Zhang Zhaoli also said that the business department of the Ministry of Health rarely notified the Scientific Research Committee when holding professional meetings. Wang Dejin of the Institute of Occupational Health said: When the Ministry of Health established the Institute of Occupational Health, it said how important it was, but it often transferred researchers to rush to other tasks. Liu Peinan of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said: The Ministry of Health and the Party organization of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences should understand what scientific research work is all about. It is impossible to lead scientific research work by only managing miscellaneous affairs. Yang Enfu of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said: How did the Ministry of Health attach importance to scientific research work in the past? To study something, first hang a sign, and then build a house, but often everything is ready, but there are no researchers. It should be that there are people before considering building a house and other issues. He also said: The Ministry of Health does not have enough trust in senior personnel and interferes too much in specific work. Yang Enfu believes that scientists should devote all their time to work. If leaders do not cherish the time of researchers and do not pay attention to the continuity of research work, work cannot be carried out. He said that it is rare for me to have an hour without someone looking for me or not answering a phone. Regarding scientific researchers, professors said that good ones should be sent to research units, but now some with average grades and illnesses are assigned here, and they ask for leave as soon as they arrive. Yang Enfu said: There should be metabolism in research units. People who do well in medical treatment and teaching are not necessarily suitable for research work. Unified allocation is certainly not good, and those who want to come themselves must also be tested for one or two years to see if they are suitable. Professors all believe that we should attach importance to the scientific research work of higher medical colleges, because many experts with research experience are in schools rather than research institutions. If the research work of higher medical colleges is not done well, good students will not be taught, and research institutions cannot supplement good research workers, and research work will naturally not be done well. Wu Zhaoren said: Now is the time to strengthen the research work of medical colleges and universities, rather than being busy establishing many research institutes. If the hen is not healthy, it will not lay eggs, and the chickens hatched from the eggs will not be raised. Liu Peinan of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said: The Ministry of Health should re-understand what scientific research work is, under what conditions it works, and what the significance of this work is. If the understanding is not clear, it is still impossible to lead scientific research work well. Many professors and experts believe that the confidentiality of information hinders scientific research work. Wang Dejin of the Institute of Occupational Health said: When I go to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other units to find materials, others welcome me with open arms and give me whatever I want, but when I come to the Ministry of Health to find information, everything is confidential. It takes several hours to copy materials at a time.

    医学教育和医学科学研究工作中的问题
    ——医学界六十多位教授、专家发表意见
    本报讯　5月13日和15日的上午，卫生部邀请了北京医学院、中国协和医学院、中国医学科学院、医学科学委员会等单位的六十几位教授、专家们座谈医学教育和医学科学研究工作。教授和专家们说：卫生部召开这样的会，次数已经不少了，希望这次不再像过去一样，开会时开会，开完了会是开完了会。北京医学院张昌颖教授说：但愿这次风能刮得长一点，虽不能像大旋风一样把树连根都拔起来，至少也应当把树吹弯过来。
    医学教育中存在严重的质和量的矛盾的原因，在于卫生部的主观主义、官僚主义。
    教授们认为医学教育当前的严重问题是质和量的矛盾。根本原因：第一、入学学生基础差、质量低。这是卫生部重量不重质的思想造成的。医学院每年的招生数字卫生部订得很大，而几年来学生来源不足，为了凑数，把不合标准的也收进来。人民卫生出版社社长白备伍说：1954年医学院录取的新生，有的平均只有二十分。第二、学生增多了，师资、设备、教学基地等等又都跟不上来，卫生部又很少考虑解决这些问题。北京医学院刘思职教授说：按北京医学院现有的人力、物力，学生要减去一半。第三、学制短，而课程多，以致许多课程无法讲得深，讲得透。第四、学生接触实际的机会少，实验和临床实习也少，学生课堂所学缺乏实践的印证。协和医学院张鋆教授说：过去学生学解剖必须要解剖半个身体，而现在学生只能解剖一点点，生理实习也都是由助教做好了，让学生看一看，至于临床实习，学生也少有机会接触病人。教授们认为学生对“琐碎”的实验操作、临床化验不感兴趣，只想搞理论、跑图书馆，这也是影响质量的原因。第五、领导不重视科学研究工作，不注意提高教师质量，北京医学院教授王志钧说，我过去搞一点科学研究工作好像“办私货”。他说大学不搞科学研究就只能算是个中学。第六、专业设置过细、专业化过早，也影响质量。
    教授认为这些都是由于卫生部过去很少听中国专家的意见，工作中存在严重的主观主义、官僚主义造成的。徐诵明说卫生部没有很好地抓业务，又不走群众路线。许多人有同感。
    教授呼吁延长学制、精简课程，让学生学会独立思考，让医学教育后继有人。
    教授们认为提高质量除了提高入学学生录取标准，充实设备，增加教学基地，减少专业设置，加强科学研究以外，首先应当考虑延长学制。张鋆、刘思职和教授们在会上呼吁，要求医学教育赶快恢复六年制，他们说：我国过去医学院的学制就是六年、七年，苏联也是六年，而现在，我们为什么只规定医疗系五年，口腔系四年呢？北京医学院教授王志钧说：学制短、课程多，各科讲义精简得像浓缩的鱼肝油精一样，只有几点几条，以致学生认识问题很局限，思考能力低。协和医学院林巧稚教授说：培养人才首先要打基础，毕业后的专科进修那只是盖楼房而不是打基础，基础不好，楼就盖不成。许多教授认为中医课开得太早，未经整理的中医经验，学生难分精华糟粕，费了时间，效果并不好。张鋆教授认为把祖国医学作为历史知识教给学生是必需的，但中医内经等著作不一定要学生去学。至于总结出来的有效经验可以摆在不同科目里讲。教授们认为延长学制，如果目前不能全国一起改，可以先在少数学校先改，先培养一批研究人才和师资，否则会如澳大利亚医学代表团团员说的，将来中国医学教育会后继无人。教授们说延长学制主要是增加基础科学，基础医学，实习、实验的时间。最好先学一两年预科，再入本科。预科最好设在理学院。
    把优秀的毕业生分配去当助教，给教师以进修的机会。
    其次应当大力进行提高师资质量的工作。北京医学院刘思职教授说，近几年来教学法有了改进，但教学内容没有提高，这是因为年轻的教师没有足够的本钱。应当选一些优秀的、有培养前途的毕业生在学校工作，现在是把好的学生分到各地，中等水平的或者是为了照顾身体或爱人关系的留了下来，同时留校的也只重政治不重业务，这样做，教师质量怎能好呢。张鋆教授也认为应当重视培养助教的工作。这是新的师资的来源。北京医学院方亮教授说，过去卫生部很少考虑讲师以上干部的进修问题，这些人没有时间进修，教学质量也成问题。卫生部筹建和调并学校很不慎重
    教授们批评过去筹建和调并学校不慎重。徐诵明说：去年办了四个中医学院，别的三个我不清楚，北京的校舍设备都是借用的，教师又是东拼西凑，一个大学为什么这样匆忙地办起来呢？试问办中医学院的目的是什么？假若说为了传授中医经验，由中医带徒就可以了，假若说为了总结、研究、整理中医经验，高中学生未必能行。他的发言得到许多人的同意。他又说：过去整顿归并了一些院校，这显然是考虑不周的，如浙江医学院牙科，是中国最早的一个牙科，师资设备较齐全，历史悠久，不知为什么把这些师资分在东北、四川各地，上海第一医学院的牙科，历史比浙医短，条件远不如浙医却不去动它。又如山西医学院公共卫生系只有一个教师，江苏医学院有几个，不知为什么把江苏的并入山西。北京医学院朱希涛说，卫生部不要过早地到处下蛋，四处下蛋不一定会孵出鸡来，还是让现在的鸡长得更健康一些。只管杂务是无法领导科学研究工作的
    教授们认为卫生部非常不重视科学研究工作。北京医学院的教授们说，北京医学院全年的科学研究经费只有七万元，据说还为第二位。医学科学委员会副秘书长张查理说：卫生部安排科学研究经费既患寡又患不均。拿1956年来说，全国三十多个院校全年研究四十多个中心问题，先给一百万元，几经争取才有了一点增加，而生物制品所只研究一项中心问题，却拨给七十万元（据说后来有了减少），张查理还说，卫生部业务司开专业会从来就很少通知科学研究委员会。劳动卫生研究所汪德晋说：卫生部在建立劳动卫生研究所时说如何如何重要，可是又常常调研究人员去突击别的工作。中国医学科学院刘培楠说：卫生部和医学科学院党组织应当了解科学研究工作究竟是什么一回事，只管杂务是领导不好科学研究工作的。中国医学科学院杨恩孚说：过去卫生部是怎样重视科学研究工作的呢？要研究什么就先挂招牌，接着盖房子，可是常常是一切就绪了，却没有研究人员。应当是有了人再考虑盖房子等问题。他还说：卫生部对高级人员的信任是不够的，对具体工作干涉过多。杨恩孚认为应当让科学家把所有时间用于工作。领导不爱惜研究人员的时间，不重视研究工作的连续性，工作是无法进行的。他说，我一个小时没有人找，或是不接一个电话那是罕有的事。关于科学研究人员，教授们说，要把好的送到研究单位，现在却是一些成绩中等，有病的分配来了，一来就请假。杨恩孚说：在研究单位应有新陈代谢，医疗和教学做得好的人不一定适宜做研究工作。统一分配固然不好，自己要来的，也得经过一、二年的考验是否合适。教授们都认为应当重视高等医学院校的科学研究工作，因为许多有研究工作经验的专家都在学校而不在研究机构，高等医学院校的研究工作做得不好，不会教出好的学生，研究机关也不可能补充好的研究工作人员，研究工作自然做不好。吴朝仁说：现在是加强医学院校的研究工作，而不是忙于建立许多研究所，母鸡不健康，不会下蛋，下的蛋孵的鸡也养不大的。中国医学科学院刘培楠说：卫生部应当重新认识一下什么叫科学研究工作，在什么条件下工作，这工作有什么意义，认识不清，还是领导不好科学研究工作的。许多教授、专家认为资料保密妨碍了科学研究工作，劳动卫生研究所汪德晋说：在总工会等单位去找材料，别人双手欢迎，要什么给什么，可是来卫生部找资料，东也保密，西也保密。为抄资料一次抄几个钟头。
