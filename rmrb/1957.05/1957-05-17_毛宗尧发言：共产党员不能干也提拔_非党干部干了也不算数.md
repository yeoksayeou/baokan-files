Mao Zongyao Speaks:
    Communist Party Members Who Can't Do the Job Are Still Promoted; Non-Party Cadres’ Work Doesn't Count
    The Party member leading cadres of the Machinery Import Company have all three "-isms," with sectarianism being particularly prominent. Subjectivism and bureaucracy stem from sectarianism.

    Time Brings Promotions for Party Members; Non-Party Cadres Don't Get a Raise for Years
    There is sectarianism in the use, training, and promotion of cadres. Non-Party cadres are used more, trained less, and promoted even less. Communist Party member cadres receive more training and promotion. Of the fifteen division-level cadres in the Machinery Import Company, not one is a non-Party member. In fact, the Commercial Intelligence Division, Administrative Division, and Planning Division often lack directors, and the work of the director is often done by first-class clerks. Some of these first-class clerks do the director's work very well. But because they are not Communist Party members, they are not promoted. The Commercial Intelligence Division has been without a director for a long time. Later, someone who studied theory was transferred from the Northeast to serve as deputy director. He himself was emotional, and the people below were dissatisfied. Later, he was transferred away, and another Communist Party member was transferred in. It seems that Communist Party members can do any job, and even if non-Party members do the work of a director, they cannot become a director. These non-Party members are classified as having "ideological problems." They are said to have "ideological problems" and cannot be directors; because they cannot be directors, they have ideological problems, and so on and so forth....
    There was a Party member who was a deputy section chief in 1951 and became a full division chief in 1955. But non-Party members haven't been promoted even one grade in six years. If this continues, the enthusiasm of both Party members and non-Party members will be affected. Party members think that as long as time passes, they can be promoted. Therefore, they do not pay attention to learning foreign languages or professional skills, and there is a lack of supervision and motivation.

    Unable to Work Like Masters; What's the Use of Talking About "Cultivating Attitude"?
    After several social movements, the masses have also made progress. Non-Party cadres are also conscientious in their work and respect Party members. However, the fact for several years has been: the heavy work is done by non-Party comrades; they do the work, but they are not promoted. Of course, promotion is not just about giving fame and status, but about affirming their achievements and their loyalty. In this case, everyone has to seek no merit but seek no fault, as long as they don't get on the stage during the "movement." Take myself as an example. I have been the manager's secretary for four years, from drafting the first contract clauses to giving lectures at the Foreign Trade Institute. All of this has been my work. I have also received several awards over the years. However, I have only been promoted one grade in six years, and I am not convinced. I am the manager's secretary, and the Party trusts me. However, I cannot attend the manager's meetings; instead, Party and Youth League member secretaries and confidential clerks take notes. Recently, they have all taken leave, and the recording work is still done by people who help out. This situation shows that I am trusted and not trusted at the same time. Of course, the vast majority trust me.
    Since the Party member cadres in the divisions are weak in professional skills, only "cultivating the master attitude of non-Party members" is discussed. In fact, this is not a matter of cultivating attitude, but of allowing people to truly work like masters. For example, we are masters in our own homes, but if we cannot lie on our own beds, cannot talk to our family members, and cannot ask our children to do anything, then what kind of master are we?
    If the division chief is not good, they create various titles, such as division secretary or division engineer, to do the actual work. In fact, they are doing the work of a division chief, but without the position of division chief. Therefore, they cannot convince people.

    Personnel System Lacks Standard; Fate of Cadres Determined by Impression
    Overcoming sectarianism is not only an ideological problem, but also involves institutional problems. For example, the personnel system lacks a standard. We often say "both virtue and talent," but what is virtue? What standard should talent reach? What conditions should division chiefs and section chiefs have? There are no definite standards. Generally, the personnel unit nominates, and the matter is discussed at the administrative meeting. Everyone just casually says "this person is not bad" and promotes them; "this person is proud" and does not promote them. All those who attend the administrative meeting are pure Party members. As long as they say something, they can decide a person's fate.
    Of course, Party members understand Party members. As for the shortcomings of non-Party members, they should be clearly pointed out to help them improve together. Walls should be torn down on both sides. Some non-Party cadres also lack respect for Party members because Party members do not respect and trust them enough. Non-Party cadres say, "You are nothing more than that!" "You lead me politically, but I am better than you in business." If sectarianism is not overcome, non-Party cadres cannot view problems calmly. In this election of the fifteen members of the Business Committee, apart from the manager and the person in charge of personnel, the other thirteen are non-Party cadres. It can be seen that the business level of non-Party cadres is not low. However, many comrades who have won awards over the years have not moved up one grade in seven years, while Party members have been promoted three or four grades in a row. In this way, Party members certainly do not need to study hard or delve into their work.

    Manager's Nanny Has a Room to Herself; Ordinary Cadres Live Cramped
    In terms of living conditions, the treatment of cadres is also very different. The blackboard newspaper once revealed that the area of the manager's dormitory and that of ordinary cadres was in an eight-to-one ratio. The manager's nanny has a room to herself, while ordinary cadres have three generations living together. My family of ten lives in a 33-square-meter house. During the day, we put our clothes on the bed, and at night, we put them on the table. The house is also damp, and my wife has had rheumatism for two years. The houses of Party member cadres of my rank are the best in our courtyard; some live in the Western Suburbs Building. I have been raising this issue for two or three years, but it has not been resolved. The empty room across the street has been empty for several months, but I am not allowed to move in. Party member families have overflowing cabinets, but I don't have a single one. Party member cadres who are first-class clerks sit in swivel chairs, while non-Party cadres sit on hard benches. The same clerks, but different butts. These are all stipulated by the person in charge, not by the Party, but the Party has not paid attention. As the saying goes, "How are the Bodhisattvas in the temple ruined? They are ruined by being praised." This is very worthy of vigilance.

    Focusing Only on Politics Does Not Do the Job Well; Politics and Business Should Be Equally Emphasized
    In terms of going abroad, the treatment of Party members and non-Party members is different and is very prominent. Going abroad has become a political treatment. Some people don't understand anything and haven't even joined the company, but they are considered company personnel and sent abroad. Because a Party member cadre was emotional before joining the company, the leadership sent him abroad to comfort him. However, he still didn't do anything after going abroad and was eventually transferred away. They go abroad, and we stay at home to "clean up their messes." Politics is important, but it should be combined with business. In the past, we criticized focusing on business and neglecting politics. I say that focusing on politics and neglecting business is also wrong; both should be equally emphasized. Otherwise, politics is abstract and in the air. Those with high political levels should do their work better.
    The foreign trade business is new, but it has not improved much in the past few years. There is no system for ordering goods, and we suffer losses on the price issue every year. The management methods have always been to win by quantity rather than quality. The Machinery Import Company has more than 300 employees, which is too many. Our company's business is mainly with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries, and the transactions are the simplest. Why do we need so many people?

    Civil Construction Letters Not Delivered by Mail Room; Party Notices Delivered Several Times a Day
    In the past year or two, the Party has supported the Civil Construction Association a lot, but in general, it still doesn't pay enough attention. A member of the Civil Construction Association had problems in the anti-espionage campaign, later suffered from a mental illness and was sent to a hospital, but we didn't know. Later, we found out by chance and I asked the Party committee what the problem was. The Party committee only said that he had been sent to a mental hospital. I don't know what the problem is.
    Some meetings are open to the union in the office, but I am the head of the Civil Construction Association in the office and cannot attend.
    Incoming and outgoing letters of the Civil Construction Association are not delivered by the company's mail room at all. The Communist Party notices, however, are delivered by the mail room several times a day. When the Civil Construction Association sends out notices, I have to put stamps on them and mail them. Sometimes, when I have materials for developing new members, it is inconvenient to mail them, so I have to deliver them myself.

    Many Opinions Have Been Raised Over the Years; They Are All Fleeting and Do Not Bear Fruit
    Finally, I want to talk about the issue of "flowering and bearing fruit." Many opinions have been raised over the years, but they are only fleeting and do not bear fruit. I used to edit the blackboard newspaper, and it was difficult to reject submissions because there were so many. Now it is difficult to get submissions because the masses say that there is no follow-up to the opinions raised, so they don't write. Otherwise, the fruit that bears after flowering is not a response to the opinions of the masses, but the masses eat their own fruit—they are punished.

### 毛宗尧发言：共产党员不能干也提拔  非党干部干了也不算数

    毛宗尧发言：
    共产党员不能干也提拔  非党干部干了也不算数
    机械进口公司的党员领导干部，三个主义都有，宗派主义特别突出，主观主义、官僚主义是由宗派主义而来。
    时间会给党员带来升级  非党干部几年不提一级
    在干部的使用、培养和提拔上，有宗派主义。对非党干部使用多、培养少，提拔更少。对共产党员干部是培养和提拔多。机械进口公司十五个处级干部，没有一个非党干部。其实，商情处、行政处、计划处经常无处长，处长的工作常由一等科员作。这些一等科员有的作处长工作还作得很好。但是因为不是共产党员，所以不提拔。商情处一直没有处长，后来从东北调来一个学理论的人来作副处长，他本人闹情绪，下面也不满意。后来调走了，又调了一个共产党员来。好像共产党员可以做一切工作，非党员即使做了处长的工作也不能当处长。这些非党员，被归为“思想问题”类。说他们有“思想问题”，不能作处长；因为不能作处长就闹思想问题，如此循环……。
    有一个党员，1951年还是副科长，1955年就成了正处长。但非党员呢，有六年没提过一级的。这样下去，党员与非党员的积极性都要受到影响。党员认为只要时光过去，自己就可以升级。因此他们不注意学外文、学业务，也缺乏督促和鞭策的力量。
    没法像主人翁一样做事空谈“培养态度”有何用
    经过几次社会运动，群众也都有了进步。非党干部在工作中也都兢兢业业，对党员也很尊敬。可是，几年来的事实是：重的工作由非党同志作；作了工作，却不被提拔。当然，提拔不等于是给名誉地位，而是肯定他的成绩，他的忠诚。在这种情况下，大家只好不求有功、但求无过，只要在“运动”中不上台就行了。以我为例，作了四年经理秘书，从草拟第一个合同条文开始，直到去外贸学院讲课，都是我的工作。数年来我也得过几次奖。可是，六年来才提了一级，我就是不服气。我作经理秘书，党是相信我的。但是，经理碰头会我不能参加，而是由党、团员秘书和机要员去作记录。最近他们都请了假，记录工作还是由帮忙的人来作。这种情况，表现了对我似信不信。当然，绝大部分是对我信任的。
    既然处的党员干部业务能力薄弱，只有“培养非党人士的主人翁态度”。其实，这不是培养态度的问题，而是要让人真正能够像主人翁一样地去干。比如我们在自己家里，是家里的主人，可是如果我们不能躺在自己的床上，不能同家里的人说话，不能叫自己的小孩去作什么事，那还叫什么主人呢？
    处长不行，就巧立名目，叫什么处秘书呀、处工程师呀，去做实际工作。其实，他们做的工作都是处长的工作，而没有处长职位。这样，他们也就不能说服人。
    人事制度没有一定标准  凭印象决定干部的命运
    克服宗派主义，不仅是思想问题，还牵涉到制度问题。如人事制度，没有一个标准。我们常说“德才兼备”，德是什么德？才要达到什么标准？如处长、科长，要有什么条件？都没有一定标准。一般由人事单位提名，在行政会议上讨论。大家凭印象随便说说“这人不坏”，就提；“这人骄傲”，就不提。参加行政会议的，都是清一色的党员。只要他们说一说，就可以决定一个人的命运。
    当然，党员对党员是了解的。至于非党员的缺点，应该明确指出，帮助他们共同提高。拆墙要两面拆。非党干部中也有些人由于党员对他们尊重和相信不够，所以他们对党员也尊重不够。非党干部说：“你也不过如此！”“政治你领导我，业务我比你行。”如果宗派主义不克服，非党干部看问题也不能冷静。这次选举业务委员会的十五位委员，除经理和管人事的以外，其余十三位都是非党干部。可见非党干部业务水平不低。但是，不少历年得奖的同志，七年未动一级，党员则连升三级、四级。这样，党员当然就不需要苦学、苦钻研了。
    经理的保姆一人一间房  一般干部住得拥挤不堪
    生活上，干部的待遇也很不一样。黑板报上就曾揭发经理和一般干部所住宿舍的面积是八比一。经理的保姆一人一间房，而一般干部是三代同堂。我是十口之家，只住了三十三平方公尺的屋子，白天把衣服放在床上，晚上放在桌子上。房子又潮湿，爱人生了两年风湿病。与我同级的党员干部住的房子，是我们院里最好的；也有的是住在西郊大楼里。我提了两三年的意见，也不给我解决。对面的空房空了几个月也不让我住进去。党员家里柜满为患，我一个柜也没有。一等科员的党员干部坐转椅，非党干部坐硬板凳。一样的科员，但是屁股不一样。这些都是主管人规定的，不是党作的，但是党没注意。常言说：“菩萨庙里的菩萨怎么坏的，就是被捧坏的。”这很值得警惕。
    光重政治做不好工作  政治和业务应该并重
    在出国问题上，党员与非党员的待遇不一样，也表现得非常突出。出国成为政治待遇了，有些人什么都不懂甚至还没进公司，就算作公司的人出国。因为有个党员干部没到公司就闹情绪，领导上就以派出国去安慰他。可是他出国后还是不干，最后调走了事。他们出国，我们就在家里“擦屁股”。政治是重要的，但是应该同业务结合起来看。过去批判重业务、轻政治。我说，重政治、轻业务也不对，应该并重。否则，政治是抽象的、悬空的。政治水平高的，工作应该作得更好。
    外贸业务是新的，但是，几年来改进不多。订货没有制度，在价格问题上也年年吃亏。经营管理的方法，一直是以量胜质。机械进口公司有三百多个工作人员，实在太多。我们这个公司的业务主要是同苏联和人民民主国家交易，交易最简单，为什么要这么多人？
    民建信件收发室不送  党的通知一天送几回
    近一两年来，党对民建支持不少，但是总的来说，还是重视不够。民建一个会员在肃反中有问题，后来得了神经病送进了病院，我们也不知道。后来碰巧知道了，我去问党委是什么问题，党委只说已送精神病院。此人问题究竟如何，我也不得而知。
    有些会，机关里的工会都可以列席，而我是机关里的民建负责人却不能参加。
    民建往来信件，公司收发室一概不送。而共产党的通知，收发室一天送几回。民建发通知，我只好贴邮票寄。有时要发展新会员的材料，不便邮寄，只好自己送。
    几年来意见提了不少  都是昙花一现不结果
    最后要谈谈“开花结果”的问题。几年来，意见提了不少，但只是昙花一现，不结果。我编黑板报，过去是退稿困难，因为稿子多；现在是要稿困难，群众说，提了意见没有下文，不写了。不然开花以后结的果，并不是答复群众的意见，而是群众自食其果——被整。
