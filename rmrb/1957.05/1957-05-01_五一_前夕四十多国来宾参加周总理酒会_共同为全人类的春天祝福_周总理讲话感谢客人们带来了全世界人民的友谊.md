Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand reception this evening to entertain over one thousand guests from more than forty countries.

The Beijing Hotel, where the reception was held, was unprecedentedly lively this evening. An hour before the reception began, two thousand Chinese and foreign guests began to arrive. Premier Zhou Enlai and the Vice Premiers warmly greeted the guests at the entrance.

All the Vice Chairmen and Vice Premiers in Beijing today, as well as leading staff members from other fields, attended the reception and mingled with the guests, drinking and chatting.

As the grand reception began, Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the platform and, standing among flowers and palm trees, delivered a speech, saying: Comrades, friends:

Tomorrow is International Labor Day, May 1st. On the eve of this great festival, we are extremely honored and pleased to be able to celebrate this holiday together with Comrade Rakhidov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, who is visiting our country with Chairman Voroshilov, the head of our great ally, the Soviet Union; with Comrade Yelyutin, Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union; Comrade Fedrin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union; Comrade Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to our country; together with Sao Hkun Hkio, Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities of our friendly neighbor, the Union of Burma; together with the delegation from our fraternal nation of Romania, the Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council, headed by Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu; and together with distinguished friends from more than forty countries. You have brought to us the profound friendship of the people of all countries towards the Chinese people from all regions of the world, making the spring here even warmer and this great festival even more radiant.

The Chinese people are engaged in diligent labor, striving to build our country into an advanced, socialist industrialized nation in a not-too-distant future. We need peace and friendship. During my recent visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe, I personally witnessed that, despite considerable differences in many aspects, including political views and religious beliefs, the people of all countries are willing to live in peace with each other and are willing to be friends. Our gathering today has made me feel this even more strongly on a larger scale. The more than one thousand foreign friends present here belong to different countries and nationalities, are engaged in different professions, and hold different political views, but we all hope to unite in the great cause of safeguarding world peace, and we all hope to develop friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries through economic ties, cultural exchanges, and friendly visits. Comrades and friends, we sincerely and warmly welcome you. In the cause of safeguarding international peace and promoting friendly cooperation, we, the six hundred million Chinese people, will steadfastly continue to shoulder our due responsibility.

During your visit to our country, you will see some of the achievements that the people of New China have made in peaceful labor over the past few years. However, our country is still very backward in many aspects, and our work still has many shortcomings. At present, we are working hard to correct the shortcomings in our work and paying attention to resolving the various contradictions that constantly arise on our path forward. We are also determined to continue to learn wisdom and experience from the people of all countries. We hope that the comrades and friends from all countries present here will be able to offer criticisms and suggestions on our work based on what you have seen and heard, so that we can benefit from them.

Comrades and friends, on the eve of the great International Labor Day, let us:

    For peaceful labor,
    For international peace and the friendship and unity of the people of the world,
    For the spring of all mankind,
    Drink a toast.

When Premier Zhou Enlai finally asked everyone to raise their glasses for a toast, more than a thousand guests from various countries raised their glasses and repeatedly cheered "Ganbei!" in newly learned Chinese.

After Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, he stepped down from the stage to meet with guests from various countries one by one.

Premier Zhou first toasted with Rakhidov, Yelyutin, Fedrin, Yudin, and others who accompanied Chairman Voroshilov on his visit to China.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai met with the delegation from the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council. Premier Zhou Enlai said to them: "We are currently conducting rectification. Please offer more suggestions to help us." Constantin Pârvulescu, head of the delegation and Chairman of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, conveyed Chairman Groza's greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong to Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou Enlai also asked Constantin Pârvulescu to convey his regards to Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Comrade Groza.

Zhou Enlai cordially chatted with Sao Hkun Hkio, Speaker of the Burmese Chamber of Nationalities, and his wife, saying, "We are old friends. Our two countries are indeed like compatriots." He also invited Sao Hkun Hkio and his wife to visit his home.

When Zhou Enlai met with the Moroccan National Consultative Assembly delegation visiting China, he raised his glass to them and said, "Welcome!"

Premier Zhou Enlai walked among the representatives of trade unions from various countries. He raised his glass to welcome the first group of nine Thai representatives to visit China and toasted Singapore's independence and China-Singapore friendship with Lee Tzu-Lin and other trade union representatives from Singapore. When Premier Zhou walked in front of the representatives of Arab trade unions, the representatives raised their glasses and cheered, "Zhou Enlai, Nasser." The Premier raised his glass in response, saying, "For the unity of the Arab people, for the health of the leaders of the Arab countries, for the unity of Asia and Africa." Premier Zhou Enlai also accepted a painted bottle from the Greek trade union representatives and toasted for socialism together with trade union representatives from the People's Democratic countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai met with members of the Japanese trade, women's, trade union, drama, and archaeology delegations visiting China. He raised his glass to wish for peaceful coexistence, friendly cooperation, and unity between China and Japan in the struggle for world peace. Members of the Japanese Tokai Local Government Delegation to China expressed their hope that Premier Zhou would visit Japan. Premier Zhou said: I visited Japan forty years ago. I hope to have the opportunity to visit Japan again in the future. Japanese friends said: We will work hard to make this visit happen as soon as possible.

Premier Zhou Enlai then toasted friends from the art and sports delegations visiting China from various countries. Premier Zhou raised his glass with Thai film queen Suphan Buranaphim and said to all the Thai artists, "Welcome!"

When meeting with the Cambodian football team, Premier Zhou hoped that they would win in the competition with the Chinese athletes.

Premier Zhou also warmly shook hands with the leader, instructor, and members of the Soviet Kazakh National Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra. Soprano soloist Bibigul came forward to toast Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou said to her: I will see your performance soon, cheers to your beautiful singing! She also said to Premier Zhou: Cheers to the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and to your health!

Premier Zhou also met with returned overseas Chinese and representatives of various ethnic groups.

The reception proceeded very enthusiastically, and many friends from various countries who did not know each other became acquainted at first sight. Romanian Metropolitan of Moldavia (Greek Orthodox) Justin Moisescu, a member of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council, met with members of the Greek trade union delegation and warmly embraced, kissed, and talked for a long time. A member of the Japanese Fukuoka Prefecture Friendship Delegation to China took a photo with members of the Soviet Kazakh National Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra.

As the reception was coming to an end, Premier Zhou once again raised his glass to wish all the guests good health and world peace. At this time, the audience burst into thunderous applause, and people spoke "friendship" and "peace" in various languages. (Picture attached)

    “五一”前夕四十多国来宾参加周总理酒会
    共同为全人类的春天祝福
    周总理讲话感谢客人们带来了全世界人民的友谊
    新华社30日讯  周恩来总理今晚举行盛大酒会，招待来自四十多个国家的一千多位来宾。
    作为酒会会场的北京饭店，今晚空前热闹。在酒会开始一小时前，两千位中外人士就开始来到这里。周恩来总理和副总理们在门口热情地迎接客人。
    今天，在京的所有副委员长和副总理和其他方面的领导工作人员都参加了酒会，他们同来宾们在一起饮酒交谈。
    这个盛大的酒会开始的时候，周恩来总理登上主席台，站在鲜花和棕树丛中讲话说：同志们，朋友们：
    明天是五一国际劳动节。在这个伟大节日的前夕，我们能够同随同我们伟大盟邦苏联元首伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国的乌兹别克加盟共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席拉希多夫、苏联高等教育部部长叶留金、苏联外交部副部长费德林、苏联驻我国大使尤金一起，同我们的友好邻邦缅甸联邦的民族院议长萧恢塔一起，同以康·帕伏列斯库主席为首的我们兄弟之邦罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团一起，以及同来自四十多个国家的尊贵的朋友们一起，欢度这个节日，感到十分荣幸和高兴。你们从全世界的各个地区带来了各国人民对中国人民的崇高友谊，使我们这里的春天更加温暖，使这个伟大的节日更加光辉。
    中国人民正在进行辛勤的劳动，争取在一个不太长的时期内，把我们的国家建设成为先进的、社会主义工业化的国家。我们需要和平和友谊。在前不久我到亚洲和欧洲的十一个国家去访问的时候，我亲眼看到各国人民尽管在许多方面，包括政治见解和宗教信仰在内，有相当大的不同，但是，他们是愿意彼此和平相处的，是愿意成为朋友的。我们今天的聚会又在更大的规模上使我强烈地感觉到这一点。在座的一千多位外国朋友属于不同的国家和民族，从事于不同的职业，抱着不同的政治见解，但是我们都希望在维护世界和平的伟大事业中团结起来，我们都希望通过经济联系、文化交流和友好访问来发展各国人民之间的友谊和合作。同志们和朋友们，我们真诚地、热烈地欢迎你们。在维护国际和平和促进友好合作的事业中，我们六亿中国人民将坚定不移地继续担负起我们应尽的责任。
    在你们访问我国期间，你们将会看到新中国的人民这几年来的和平劳动已经取得了一些成就。但是，我们这个国家在许多方面还是很落后的，我们的工作还存在着不少缺点。目前我们正在努力改正我们工作中的缺点，注意解决在我们前进的道路上所不断出现的各种矛盾。我们也决心要继续向各国人民吸取智慧和经验。我们希望，在座的各国同志和朋友将能够就你们的所见所闻对我们的工作提出批评，提出意见，使我们能够得到教益。
    同志们和朋友们，在伟大的五一国际劳动节的前夕，让我们：
    为和平的劳动，
    为国际和平和全世界人民的友谊和团结，
    为我们全人类的春天，
    干一杯。
    当周恩来总理最后请大家干杯的时候，来自各国的一千多宾客都举起了酒杯，一再用刚学会的中国话欢呼“干杯！”
    周恩来总理讲话后，即走下台同各国来宾一一见面。
    周总理首先同随同伏罗希洛夫主席访问中国的拉希多夫、叶留金、费德林、尤金等一起干杯。
    随后，周恩来总理会见了罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团。周恩来总理对他们说：“我们正在整风，请你们多提意见，帮助我们。”代表团团长、罗马尼亚大国民议会主席康·帕伏列斯库向周恩来转致了格罗查主席向毛泽东主席的问候。周恩来总理也请康·帕伏列斯库主席代为向乔治乌—德治同志和格罗查同志问好。
    周恩来同缅甸民族院议长萧恢塔和他的夫人亲切地叙谈，他说：“我们已是老朋友了。我们两国的确像同胞一样。”他还邀请萧恢塔夫妇到他家中作客。
    周恩来在会见马格里勃（摩洛哥）国民协商议会访华代表团时，举杯对他们说：“欢迎你们！”
    周恩来总理走到各国工会代表中间。他举杯欢迎第一批来中国访问的九位泰国代表，又同新加坡的工会代表李树林等一起举杯祝新加坡独立，祝中国新加坡友好。在周总理走到阿拉伯各国工会代表面前的时候，代表们举杯向他欢呼：“周恩来、纳赛尔”，总理举杯回答说，为阿拉伯人民的团结，为阿拉伯各国领袖的健康，为亚洲、非洲的团结。周恩来总理还接受了希腊工会代表们送给他的一个彩绘的瓶子，又同来自人民民主国家的工会代表在一起为社会主义干了杯。
    周恩来总理同日本贸易、妇女、工会、戏剧、考古界等访华代表团的人员们见了面。他举杯祝中日两国和平相处，友好合作，团结起来为世界和平奋斗。日本东海地方自治体访华代表团的团员们表示，希望周总理去日本访问。周总理说：四十年前我曾到过日本，我希望将来有机会再一次去日本访问。日本朋友们说：我们要努力促使这个访问早日实现。
    周恩来总理接着向各国文艺、体育界访华团的朋友们敬酒。周总理同泰国电影皇后素攀·武拉那屏女士碰了杯，并且对全体泰国艺术家说：“欢迎你们！”
    在同柬埔寨足球队会见时，周总理希望他们在同中国运动员比赛中获得胜利。
    周总理还同苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队领队、指导以及队员们亲切地握手。女高音独唱家比比古里前来向周总理敬酒，周总理对她说：不久我就会看到你们的演出，为你美丽的歌唱干杯！她也对周总理说：为中苏两国人民的友谊和你的健康干杯！
    周总理还同归国华侨以及各兄弟民族的代表们见了面。
    酒会进行的很热烈，许多互不相识的各国朋友们也都一见如故。罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团团员、罗马尼亚摩尔达维亚大主教（希腊正教）尤·莫伊谢斯库同希腊工会代表团团员见了面，并且亲热地拥抱、亲吻和长时间地交谈。日本福冈县友好访华团的一位团员同苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队的队员们在一起摄影留念。
    在酒会快结束的时候，周总理又一次地举杯祝全体来宾身体健康，祝世界和平。这时，全场掌声雷动，人们用各种语言说着“友好”和“和平”。（附图片）
