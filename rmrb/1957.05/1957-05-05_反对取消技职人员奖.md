    Opposing the Cancellation of Bonuses for Technical and Professional Personnel
    I believe that staff and technical personnel in factories and mines, regardless of their position or type of work, should receive production task bonuses as long as they achieve results. Firstly, these people are not sitting idle, but are busy all day serving the production in the workshops. If the work of the departments cannot keep up, such as delays in supplying materials or disputes in production scheduling, it will be difficult to complete the production tasks in the workshops. Secondly, our factory's technical and professional personnel do not receive overtime pay for working extra hours; however, taking an hour of personal leave will result in a deduction of wages, and taking sick leave will also result in a deduction of wages. On the other hand, workers receive overtime pay for working extra hours and receive bonuses every month. Therefore, it is inappropriate to cancel the bonuses for technical and professional personnel.　　　Li Qiushui

    反对取消技职人员奖
    我认为厂矿企业里的职员和技术人员，不论职务高低，工作种类，只要有成绩，都应该得完成生产任务奖金。因为第一，这些人并没有坐享其成，而是整天忙碌，为车间生产服务；如果科室人员的工作跟不上去，例如停工待料、生产调度扯皮等，车间生产任务也难以完成。第二，我厂技术人员和职员加班加点没有加班费；但是请一小时事假也要扣工资，请病假也要扣工资。而工人加班加点就有加班费，月月都得奖。因此，取消技职人员的奖金是不应该的。　　　李秋水
