Going Directly to Production Posts
Soviet Central Engineering and Technical Cadres Request Transfer to Lower Levels

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 22nd. In the process of restructuring industrial and construction management in the Soviet Union, many responsible cadres and engineering technicians who originally worked in central ministries and leading organs have requested to work directly in production posts.

Many technical cadres from the Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry have already submitted applications requesting to work in Central Asia, the Far East, and other regions. Some have already departed. Some engineers from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have requested to be sent to oil-producing areas such as Baku, Sakhalin, and Molotov Oblast. Many leaders from departments in the Ukrainian, Belorussian, Uzbek, and other republics are also preparing to work in enterprises.

Many senior technicians from the Soviet Ministry of Heavy Machine Building have also applied to work in enterprises. The chief engineer of the General Administration of Metallurgical Machinery under this ministry, Harin, who had previously served as the chief technician in the Ural Machinery Factory, has now decided to work in a factory below. Kobzeva, an engineer from this administration, is preparing to return to a factory in Donbass where she previously worked.

More than twenty people from the Soviet Ministry of Fisheries and the Russian Federation Ministry of Fisheries have requested to work in production. The Deputy Minister of Fisheries of the Russian Federation, Streletsky, who previously worked as a fishing boat captain, has expressed his willingness to work in any fishing area.

Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd. According to TASS: In the first four months of this year, the Soviet light industry produced 5.2% more daily necessities for residents than in the same period last year. Among them, silk fabrics increased by 6%, leather shoes increased by 9.8%, and the output of man-made fibers widely used in light industry increased by almost a quarter.

According to statistics from the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry, the industrial enterprises under its jurisdiction overfulfilled the production plan for the first four months of this year, producing a total of nearly two billion rubles worth of products more than originally planned. The excess production of textiles alone amounted to more than 30 million meters, and leather shoes exceeded 1.5 million pairs.
