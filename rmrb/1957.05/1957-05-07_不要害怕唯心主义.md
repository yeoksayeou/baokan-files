    Don't Be Afraid of Idealism
    Hong Qian
    The author believes there is no need to overemphasize Marxist leadership, as this may cause non-Marxists to "develop an ideological concern."
    Since the Party and the government proposed the academic policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," many people have feared that an "adverse current" of idealism will once again create waves in the academic and ideological circles, thereby affecting the leading position of Marxism in the ideological field.
    This argument was most prevalent when this academic policy was first implemented, and we still hear it today. We also remember that the comrades who advocated this view in the past and present still painstakingly tell us: "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is fundamentally different from the contention of a hundred schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, and from the free academic style of the European Renaissance. This contention must be carried out under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought.
    This view of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is completely correct. However, is it necessary to emphasize it so excessively in the process of advocating "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend?" Because such excessive emphasis seems completely unnecessary for Marxists; can they still be called Marxists if they do not understand this point? For non-Marxists, it will create an ideological concern, that is: on the one hand, the Party leadership wants us to contend, but on the other hand, it is afraid that we will contend without any reservations; therefore, those who originally wanted to "bloom" loudly become "blooming" quietly, and those who originally wanted to "bloom" quietly become not "blooming" at all.
    Although idealist thought is an "adverse current," it is not as terrible as people imagine. All terrible things in the world are those whose forms are unclear. Ghosts and monsters are frightening because they are formless and shadowless, so we can add all the most terrifying images to them, making people more and more afraid the more they think about it. If the original form of ghosts and monsters could be fully revealed, we would all be accustomed to them. The fear of idealist thought is also the same (not to mention that idealism is not a ghost or monster). If a certain idealist thought is exposed, we will not be so worried.
    In the past year, Peking University has offered several courses on idealism. Mr. Jin Yuelin's course on Russell's philosophy is a good example. When Mr. Jin first started teaching this course, the classroom was packed. The number of people auditing the course exceeded the number of people who registered for it. It is said that some came from far away. The appeal of idealist philosophy is indeed a bit pressing.
    One day, the leading comrades of the Philosophy Department of Peking University talked to me about the teaching situation of this course. I said that the prosperous situation of idealist courses would not last long. The "sophisticated theories" of modern bourgeois philosophy will not penetrate deeply into the minds of people who do not have a philosophical foundation in this area. Some arguments in modern bourgeois philosophy have their own theoretical significance from the perspective of its entire system (for example, in Russell's philosophy, the argument that "the King of France is fat"), but when viewed in isolation, they are absurd and ridiculous. However, these absurd and ridiculous arguments are the main points of a certain theory, so people who listen to this type of course for the first time will become tired and unable to persevere if they do not have a high degree of patience.
    The facts were as I expected; the prosperous state of this Russell's philosophy course soon became a thing of the past. Some people's previous fantasies about Russell's philosophy were not realized. On the contrary, I heard some people say: Russell spent so much effort and used so many mathematical logic theories to prove whether the proposition that the King of France is fat. What kind of philosophy is this? Isn't this philosophy "indulging in petty things and losing one's lofty aspirations?"
    Several weeks ago, I gave two lectures on Mach's philosophical thought for the Philosophy Department of Peking University and the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences. The leading comrades of the Philosophy Department of Peking University and the Institute of Philosophy had asked me to give a report on Mach a long time ago. I always declined repeatedly. The reason I did this was because I had not properly studied Mach in the past, and I was afraid that I would not be able to say anything. But the main reason was that I had some ideological concerns. I thought that publicly talking about Mach's philosophical thought and promoting his idealist philosophy would not be beneficial to the current ideological circles.
    But according to what I learned later, no one thought that Mach's philosophical thought was superior to materialism, and that Mach's philosophy was "scientific philosophy." Most people believe that through more understanding of Mach, they will feel more correct and powerful about Lenin's criticism of Machism philosophy in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." As for myself: in the past, I was influenced by Professor Frank (that is, Professor Frank, whom Lenin criticized in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism"), and my evaluation of Lenin's book was not so correct. Now, through the process of preparing the lecture notes, I have a better understanding of Mach's philosophical thought, and therefore I feel more and more that Lenin's points in that book on Mach's element theory, the principle of economic thinking, and voluntarism are all deeply related to the essentials of Mach's philosophy; I feel more and more that Lenin's book is not only a work of political struggle, but also a work rich in high academic value.
    I think we don't need to be afraid of the "adverse current" of idealism; because the facts tell us that since the academic policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was proposed more than half a year ago, this "adverse current" of idealism has not shaken the materialist foundation of academic thought, and the leading position of Marxism in the ideological field has not become a problem at all. This is a fact. Facts are stronger than any eloquence.
    I also believe that there were, are, and will be non-Marxists in the past, present and future. Through "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," non-Marxists can gradually approach Marxism, and the number of people who believe in Marxism will gradually increase. But this requires Marxists and non-Marxists to be open and honest with each other in thought and theory, and it can never be achieved by any political power or administrative order.
    I believe that true Marxists will not be afraid of idealism, just as our socialist peace camp is not afraid of the atomic bombs and missiles of imperialist countries. Fear means being timid and cowardly; materialism has no reason to be afraid of idealism.
    In short: continuing to let go and implement the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is the only way to save the academic atmosphere that has been suffocated by dogmatism, subjectivism, and non-Marxism in the past few years, and to pave the way and lay the foundation for the future brilliant socialist ideology and culture.
    We should sincerely support the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by the Party and the government, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to continue to let go and implement "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

### 不要害怕唯心主义

    不要害怕唯心主义
    洪谦
    作者认为不需要过分强调马克思主义领导，因为这样会使非马克思主义者“产生一种思想上的顾虑”。
    自从党和政府提出“百家争鸣”的学术方针之后，许多人都害怕唯心主义的“逆流”行将在学术思想界重新掀波作浪，因而影响到马克思主义在思想领域中的领导地位。
    这种论调在这个学术方针开始实行的时候，最为普遍，一直到今天也还有听到它的机会。我们还记得主张这种看法的同志们过去和现在还是苦口婆心地告诉我们：“百家争鸣”与春秋战国时代的诸子百家争鸣，与西欧文艺复兴时代的自由学风根本不同，这个争鸣要在马克思列宁主义思想指导之下进行的。
    这种对于“百家争鸣”的看法是完全正确的。不过是不是有需要在这个提倡“百家争鸣”的过程中那样过分强调地提出来呢？因为这样过分地强调对于马克思主义者，似乎根本不需要；他们不了解这一点还可以说是马克思主义者么？对于非马克思主义者则会产生一种思想上的顾虑，就是说：党领导上一方面要我们争鸣，一方面又害怕我们毫无顾虑地争鸣；因此原想大鸣的，则变为小鸣，原想小鸣的，则变为不鸣了。
    唯心主义思想虽然是一种“逆流”，但并不如人所想像的那样可怕。世界上凡是可怕的东西就是形影不明的东西，鬼怪之所以令人害怕乃是因为它无形无影，因而我们可以将一切最可怕的形象加在它的身上，所以令人愈想愈怕，如果鬼怪的原形能够毕露出来，我们大家都能见怪不怪，对于唯心主义思想的害怕也是如此（何况唯心主义并不是鬼怪），如果将某种唯心主义思想加以揭露，我们也会不那样杞人忧天了。
    在北京大学这一年来开设了若干关于唯心主义方面的课程。金岳霖先生主讲的罗素哲学就是一个很好的例子。当金先生这门课初开讲的时候，课堂都挤得满满的。旁听的人超过选课的人，听说还有来自远地的。唯心主义哲学的吸引力实在是有点逼人了。
    有一天北京大学哲学系的领导同志和我谈到这门课的教学情况，我说唯心主义课程这样繁荣的情况是不会久的。现代资产阶级哲学的一套“细致的理论”对于一般没有这一方面的哲学基础的人，是不会一下就深入进去的。现代资产阶级哲学中一些论点从它的整个体系来说，自有它的理论上的意义（例如在罗素哲学中所谓“法国皇帝是个胖子”这个论点），但是孤立地来看则是荒唐可笑的。然而这种荒唐可笑的论点正是某个理论主要之点，因此对于初听这种课程的人如果没有高度的忍耐性是会生厌而不能坚持下去。
    事实果不出我所料；这门罗素哲学课程的繁荣状态不久就成为过去了，有些人以前对于罗素哲学所抱的幻想并没有得到实现，相反的，我听到个别人说：罗素费了那些大的力量，用了那么多的数理逻辑的理论来证明法国皇帝是不是一个胖子这个命题，这是什么哲学呢？这种哲学不是“玩物丧志”又是什么呢？
    我在数周前为北京大学哲学系和科学院哲学研究所讲了二次关于马赫的哲学思想。北京大学哲学系和哲学研究所的领导同志们很久以前就要我作关于马赫的报告。我总是再三地推辞。我所以这样做的原因，是因为我对于马赫过去没有好好地研究过，恐怕讲不出什么东西来，但主要的原因，还是我思想上有些顾虑，我认为这样公开地讲马赫的哲学思想，宣传他的唯心主义哲学对于当前思想界没有什么好处。
    但是以我事后所了解的情况来说，并没有人认为马赫的哲学思想有比唯物主义优越的地方，马赫的哲学才是“科学的哲学”。多数的人都认为，通过对马赫的更多了解，对于列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”中批判马赫主义哲学之点就会感到愈加正确而有力。就以我个人来说：自过去受了佛兰克教授（即列宁在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”中批评过的佛兰克教授）的影响，对于列宁这本书的估价不是那样正确的，现在我通过准备讲演稿的过程，对于马赫的哲学思想比较了解多了一些，因而愈觉得列宁在该书内对于马赫的要素学说、思维经济原则以及唯意志论诸点，都是深中了马赫哲学的要害；愈觉得列宁这部书不仅是具有政治斗争的著作，而且是富于高度学术性的著作。
    我认为我们对于唯心主义的“逆流”似乎用不着害怕；因为事实告诉我们：“百家争鸣”的学术方针提出后这半年多时间以来，唯心主义这个“逆流”并没有动摇学术思想的唯物主义基础，马克思主义在思想领域中的领导地位更没有半点成为问题，这是事实。事实胜于任何的雄辩。
    我也认为非马克思主义者，过去有，现在有，将来还会有的。经过“百家争鸣”可以将非马克思主义者与马克思主义渐渐地接近，使相信马克思主义的人渐渐地增多。但是这要经过马克思主义者与非马克思主义者在思想上和理论上的开诚相见，绝不是任何政治力量或行政命令可以达到目的。
    我认为真正的马克思主义者是不会害怕唯心主义的，正如我们社会主义和平阵营之不害怕帝国主义国家的原子弹导弹一样。畏惧就是表示心虚胆怯；唯物主义是无任何理由害怕唯心主义的。
    总而言之：继续放手，贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，才能将过去几年来为教条主义，主观主义，非马克思主义所窒息的学术空气挽救过来，才能为未来的灿烂光辉的社会主义思想文化开辟道路和奠定基础。
    我们应该真诚地拥护党和政府所提出的这个“百家争鸣”的政策，坚决地响应毛主席所指出的继续放手，贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的伟大号召。
