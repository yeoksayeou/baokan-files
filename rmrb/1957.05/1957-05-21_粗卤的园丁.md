    The Clumsy Gardener
  　Bulgaria, Lazhafusi Ji. By whose decree it was, an elephant was appointed as the gardener of a flower garden. This boor, who had never smelled the fragrance of flowers, drew up a complex plan for taking care of the blossoms. It immediately began to work in the fragrant garden, intending to labor earnestly: it was determined to figure out what method was most suitable to till this garden more quickly. It gazed at the flowerbeds, considering how to begin—
  Should it water first? Or fertilize first? How could those tangled weeds be pulled out completely?
  (The entire garden's flourishing weeds displayed a riot of color.) The elephant, as usual, used its clumsy feet to crush the fragrant, delicate flowers, stuffing them into the soil—beneath its feet, the beautiful radiance of the flowers was buried. Afterward, it determined that the flowerbeds needed moisture, so it poured water incessantly from its thick trunk. For the sake of the garden's benefit, it drew such a large stream of water from the pond; before the thunder and hail arrived, the petals began to wither, and the flowers ended their lives. It eliminated everything in the garden:
  Either by trampling it to death,
  Or by destroying it with a great flood… When it once again entered the garden it managed, it looked out from a high vantage point and still couldn't definitively say whether it had watered the flowers enough. Because this garden looked like a sports field, everyone would doubt that flowers had ever grown here… The elephant, however, was pleased with itself: it inspected the work it had completed, breathed a sigh of relief, and rejoiced in its victory. It expected roses and peonies to bloom together in a month or two. However, the matter was clear, there were no flowers in the garden, not even a trace of grass. This desolate scene made our gardener burst with anger, -- this truly stung its heart! It was certain: There had been… sabotage! It didn't think to look for the reason within itself at all…

    粗卤的园丁
  　保加利亚　拉杰夫斯基不知是谁的旨意，委派大象去做花园的园丁。这位从未闻过花香的莽汉，制订了一个复杂的照料百花的计划。它马上就在芳香的花园里开始工作，打算认真地劳动一番：它决心弄清楚甚么方法最适宜更快地把这座花园翻耕一遍。它注视着花坛，考虑怎样开始——
  先浇水？还是先施肥？那缠绕着的杂草怎样才能拔个干净？
  （整个花园繁茂的莠草呈现五光十色。）大象依照惯例，用笨重的脚掌压倒芬芳、娇嫩的花儿，把它们塞进土里——在它的脚下，埋葬了花儿美丽的光辉。以后，它断定花圃需要水分，就用粗大的鼻管浇个不停。为了花园的利益，它从池子里抽出这样一股大水；等不到雷雨和冰雹，花瓣儿开始雕零，花儿结束了自己的生命。它消灭了花园里的一切：
  不是用脚踏死，
  就是用大水冲毁……当它再度走进自己管理的花园，登高一望，它还不敢最后肯定，是否给花儿浇足了水。由于这种关心花园像运动场了，要说这儿生长过花卉，每个人都会怀疑……大象却洋洋得意：巡视了自己完成的工作，轻松地吐了一口气，为胜利而欣喜。它期望一两个月后玫瑰和牡丹将要齐放。可是，事情明明白白，花园里没有花，连草儿也没影踪，这一片荒凉景色，我们的园丁禁不住怒气冲冲，——这真刺痛了它的心它肯定：这儿发生了……怠工！它丝毫没有想到在自己身上找寻原因……
