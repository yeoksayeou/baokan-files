Title: Adjusting the Actor Lineups of State-Owned and Private Theatrical Troupes

    I feel that there are still many contradictions in our Peking Opera circles that urgently need to be resolved. Otherwise, the new policy of “greatly loosening restrictions and opening up repertoire” will not be implemented well.

    Private professional troupes now have a contradiction between "lineup" and "repertoire." The most prominent issue is that the incomplete actor lineup affects the quality of performances and prevents the "release" of more traditional plays. Currently, the actor lineups of private professional troupes are generally very weak. Some troupes rely on only one or two principal actors to maintain the situation. In the opera world, these troupes are called "lone peony." Some troupes have principal actors with a solid foundation and a large repertoire, but the roles are incomplete, and the supporting cast is insufficient. "One person cannot perform the Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity," and many signature plays are put aside unused. Some troupes perform many traditional plays, but because the performance level is not high, they do not have a deep impact on the masses.

    State-owned troupes are a different situation. Their actor lineup is unprecedentedly strong, concentrating many of the best actors, with strong administrative and artistic leadership, and abundant material resources. In theory, they should be able to perform any play, but this is not the case. Although they have made great achievements in sorting out traditional repertoire, I must say that compared to the strong power they possess, what they have done is far from enough.

    Take the China Peking Opera Theatre as an example. Audiences are asking: Why can't we see Li Shaochun, Yuan Shihai, and Ye Shengzhang performing "The Chain Scheme" together? Why isn't the "Battle of Red Cliffs" performed by the Peking Opera Theatre with Ye Shenglan as Zhou Yu, Yuan Shihai as Cao Cao, Li Shaochun as Lu Su, Li Hezeng as Kong Ming, and Sun Shengwu and Xiao Shengxuan as Jiang Gan? Traditional old plays such as "The Meeting at Linjiang," "Inspiring Quan and Yu," "Taking Nan Commandery," and "Pacifying Chanzhou," given the actor lineup and conditions of the Peking Opera Theatre, would certainly play a demonstrative role if performed. Why are they not performed? It is said that there are many difficulties in assigning plays and transferring personnel in the first, second, third, and fourth troupes of the Peking Opera Theatre. As for the actors, they won't perform this play, or that role; actor A won't perform unless actor B is his partner, and actor C refuses to cooperate with actor D. In the past, famous actors in the Peking Opera world often collaborated to perform good plays. After liberation, and under state ownership, this kind of cooperation has become impossible. How can this phenomenon be explained to the audience? There are also many actors who are idle. Some have not been assigned a play for a year, some have been sick and have not performed for a long time, and some are not sick but have not performed for a long time. It is said that there is a state-owned troupe with four famous Dan roles but only one Xiaosheng. As a result, these Dan roles also became idle after joining the state-owned troupe. In this light, the contradiction of state-owned troupes is that they have a strong actor lineup but cannot "release" good repertoire.

    The actor lineup of private professional troupes needs to be enriched urgently. We must persuade those principal actors who have a "desire to lead a troupe" to put down their airs and cooperate with fraternal troupes that have the conditions to do so; at the same time, cultural leading departments should actively think of ways to make some adjustments.

    The audience has very high expectations for state-owned troupes. They hope that state-owned troupes will play a leading and demonstrative role in the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign. They hope to see more collaborations of famous actors performing good plays. It is suggested that state-owned troupes improve their systems and break down the boundaries that affect cooperative performances. Currently, some leaders of state-owned troupes are overly accommodating to famous actors and abandon political and ideological education, which is also not conducive to the "Hundred Flowers Bloom." State-owned troupes have a surplus of actors and should not let them be idle. Adjustments should be made. For us actors, there is nothing more painful than having no plays to perform. In your troupe, an actor can only play Zhao Yun in "The Empty City Stratagem," but elsewhere he can play Wang Ping. It is suggested that appropriate adjustments be made to the actors of state-owned troupes, which will both enhance the lineup of private professional troupes and enable more actors to develop. It is said that some state-owned troupes still require a lot of state subsidies every year. All walks of life across the country are accumulating funds for the country's socialist construction, and it is shameful for our literary and art circles to still be losing money.

### 调整国营剧团和民营剧团的演员阵容

    调整国营剧团和民营剧团的演员阵容
                  裘盛戎
    我觉得，我们京剧界还存在着不少矛盾，急待解决。否则，“大放手开放剧目”这个新方针是贯彻不好的。
    民间职业剧团现在存在着“阵容”和“剧目”的矛盾。最突出的是，因为演员阵容不齐整，影响了演出质量，也“放”不出更多的传统剧目。现在民间职业剧团，演员阵容一般是很薄弱的。有些剧团就凭一、二个主要演员在支撑局面。戏曲界称这种剧团叫“光杆牡丹”。有些剧团的主要演员底子很厚，能戏很多，可是角色不齐，班底不全，“一个人唱不了八仙庆寿”，许多拿手好戏干瞪着眼排不出来。有些剧团演出了不少传统剧目，因为演出水平不高，在群众中影响不深。
    国营剧团是另一种情况。他们的演员阵容是空前的强大，集中了许多最好的演员，行政领导、艺术领导都强，物质力量雄厚。按说该是什么戏都能演了，事实却不是如此。虽然他们在整理传统剧目方面很有成绩，可是我要说，比起他们拥有的雄厚力量来，却是做的很不够。
    拿中国京剧院来说。观众在问：为什么看不到李少春、袁世海、叶盛章合演的“连环套”？为什么京剧院演的“群英会”，不是叶盛兰的周瑜、袁世海的曹操、李少春的鲁肃、李和曾的孔明、孙盛武、萧盛萱的蒋干？像“临江会”“激权激瑜”“取南郡”“镇澶州”这些传统老戏，拿京剧院的演员阵容和条件，演出来一定能起到示范作用。为什么不见演出呢？据说，京剧团一、二、三、四团，派戏调人有很多困难。演员方面，这个戏不演，那个角色不演；甲演员非乙演员配戏不演，丙演员又决不同丁演员合作。京剧界著名演员过去经常珠联璧合地同台演出好戏，解放了，国营了，这种合作反而不可能了，该怎么向观众解释这种现象呢？窝工的演员也不少。有一年派不上戏的，有生病而长期不演出的，也有不生病而长期不演戏的。据说，有个国营剧团，有四位著名旦角，只有一名小生。于是这些旦角一加入国营剧团也闲起来了。这样看来，国营剧团的矛盾竟是演员阵容坚强，却又“放”不出好剧目。
    民间职业剧团的演员阵容，迫不及待地要加以充实。我们要说服那些有“挑班欲”的主要演员，放下架子，同有条件合作的剧团兄弟似的携手合作；同时文化领导部门也要积极想法作些调整工作。
    观众对于国营剧团的要求是很高的。他们希望国营剧团在“百花齐放”中起带头、示范作用。他们希望多看到著名演员合作演出好戏。建议国营剧团改进制度，打破影响合作演出的界限。现在有些国营剧团的领导方面，对于著名演员过于迁就，放弃政治思想教育，也是不利于“百花齐放”的。国营剧团演员有敷余，不应让他们窝工，应当进行调整。对于我们演员，没有比无戏可演更为痛苦的事了。在你们那里，一个演员在“失空斩”里只能演赵云，到外地去就能演王平。建议对国营剧团的演员作适当调整，这既增强了民间职业剧团的阵容，又能使更多演员得到发展。听说现在有些国营剧团每年还是要国家补贴很多。全国各行各业都在为国家积累社会主义建设的资金，我们文艺界还要赔钱是丢人的。
