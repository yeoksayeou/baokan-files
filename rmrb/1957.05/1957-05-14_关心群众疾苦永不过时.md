    Concern for the Suffering of the Masses is Never Outdated
	By Our Reporter Jin Yukun
    According to trade union reports from the Liaoning area, recently some units, under the guise of increasing production and practicing economy, have arbitrarily cut back on necessary welfare services for the workers and masses.
    Even from some scattered materials, it can be seen that this problem has become quite widespread. The Benxi Coal Mine, according to instructions from higher authorities, is to completely abolish the wages of canteen and nursery staff, which were originally paid from administrative expenses, and instead pay them from welfare subsidies. This abolition has created great difficulties in maintaining and running necessary welfare services. This is because the mine's total welfare subsidy for this year is only 400,000 yuan, while the wages of the aforementioned staff alone require 460,000 yuan, which is not enough even if the entire subsidy is used for wages. Some units regard reducing worker welfare as the main means of increasing production and practicing economy. According to a report from the chairman of a trade union in a certain unit, the administrative leaders, under the banners of "the trade union has committed serious economic errors" and last year's losses were due to "excessive improvements in living standards," plan to reduce wages by 5% by increasing quotas, while also reducing medical and labor protection expenses. This unit plans to increase production and save 940,000 yuan, a large part of which comes from reducing worker welfare. Of course, if worker welfare was indeed excessive last year, it can be discussed and revised with the masses, but it must never be used as the main aspect of increasing production and practicing economy, otherwise it will inevitably cause chaos. Some places have arbitrarily stopped or reduced welfare services that should be provided and are necessary. The Wafangdian Textile Factory originally had two canteens, one for the cloth factory, which at most had seven or eight hundred people eating, and one for the yarn factory, which had over a thousand people eating. In order to streamline personnel, the factory cancelled the cloth factory's canteen, and the food for the cloth factory workers had to be delivered by cart from the yarn factory canteen, which was more than a mile away. As a result, the cloth factory workers could only eat cold food every day, and at the same time, the crowding increased, which made the workers extremely dissatisfied. At the Dahuo Fang Reservoir construction site, which has over ten thousand workers, in order to save money, the original five large kettles in the main residential area, the workers' village, were reduced to three, making it impossible for single workers to get hot water. Some units have excessively reduced safety and labor protection facilities, making it impossible to ensure even the most basic working conditions. The sintering workshop of a certain steel plant plans to reduce twenty-one major safety facilities. This workshop has a large amount of dust every day, but this time they even want to remove the dust collectors and ventilation equipment that solve the dust problem.
    At present, in some places, the above situation is forming a trend, and many of these trends have come from Beijing. Some of the examples mentioned above are directly related to the leading organs in Beijing. This also reflects that the leading personnel of some enterprises often only follow the trend. Last year, they saw that the higher authorities emphasized caring for the lives of the workers, so they were ordered to "improve the lives of the workers," and some places even turned good things into stupid things. This year, they believed that the wind direction had "changed," so they made a 180-degree turn, and "increasing production and practicing economy" and "hard work and simplicity" became their shields for ignoring the lives of the masses. The so-called "living standards have improved too much," "good things have been done too centrally," "economic tendencies," "excessive demands," "affecting the worker-peasant alliance," and so on, have become popular again.
    These statements should be analyzed realistically. Improvements in the lives of the workers can only be gradual, especially given the country's financial and material resources, it is impossible to do all the good things at once. Last year, these good things were indeed done more centrally, such as wage increases, adjustments to public utility and rent charges and the prices of daily necessities, and providing relief and helping to pay off debts for some workers with financial difficulties. However, not doing things centrally does not mean not doing them at all. Not doing them at all will seriously detach us from the masses. If we do not do anything at all this year because we did too many good things last year, then we will be making another mistake. It is also true that some workers have excessive demands for living welfare. However, as long as we conduct good ideological education for them, the problem is not difficult to solve. As far as I know, when some factories in Shenyang hand over the issue of living welfare to the workers' representative assembly for discussion, everyone can handle it rationally in the spirit of thrift. In fact, many of the problems that have not been solved at present can be solved but have not been solved.
    Therefore, I believe that the problem that deserves attention and prevention at present is mainly not the economic tendencies and excessive demands of the masses (of course, education in this area is still necessary); but the bureaucratic tendencies of some people who do not care about the suffering of the masses have grown again. However, the focus of current propaganda and education work is often aimed at the former and rarely at the latter. Not long ago, comrades from the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions who returned from Fushun said that, according to their investigations, most of the things related to living welfare that have not been done at present are not due to objective conditions not permitting them. For example, the toilets in some enterprises are not managed, and they are frozen layer upon layer in winter. To defecate, one can only stand and cannot squat, and even have to queue. In some places, men and women use the same toilet, and women need someone to stand guard when they go to the toilet. These problems have not been solved for a long time, and now the workers are demanding a solution. Can it be said that the demands are too high? It is a basic requirement for workers to ask for a little hot water, especially in places with high-temperature operations. However, some enterprises have been dragging their feet for a long time without solving it. When comrades from the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions were in the steelmaking workshop of Fushun Steel Plant, the workers dragged them to taste the hot water in the workshop. After they tasted it, they realized that the water was full of dust, grease, and a fishy iron smell. How can such dirty water be drinkable for the workers? Is it also due to the issue of state investment that it is impossible to drink clean hot water? Furthermore, eating, everyone has to eat, and everyone has to eat every day, but many enterprise workers cannot eat well. In some canteens, rice is sold at one window, vegetables are sold at another window, and soup is sold at another window. Workers have to queue three times to eat a meal. As for workers eating cold rice and cold dishes, that is even more common. Is queuing and eating cold food also an insurmountable difficulty? Must everyone endure it for a long time to submit to long-term interests? Why can't these basic and solvable problems be solved? This is because some leaders rarely go deep among the masses, know very little about the suffering of the masses, and they themselves do not eat cold rice, do not have to queue to defecate, and have well-equipped toilets; they drink not only not dirty water, but clean tap water with a little tea added. Therefore, although they have also heard the workers' voices and seen the existing problems, they still turn a blind eye and muddle along, pushing it from this month to the next month, and are indifferent to the suffering of the masses to the point of numbness. As leading personnel who are Communist Party members, what could be more dangerous and terrifying than this tendency to be ideologically detached from the masses?
    We often educate workers and the masses to treat the factory as their home, but the factory's leading personnel themselves do not first treat the workers and the masses as their own family, and do not care about their food, clothing, housing, transportation, oil, rice, sauce, vinegar. Since they are them, and we are us, why must the masses regard you as one family? Why must they regard such a factory as their own home? Of course, because our workers and the masses have a very high level of awareness, they have not become passive because of the bureaucracy of some leading personnel, and they are still working and producing actively. However, if we can better care for the lives and suffering of the masses, then, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, we will definitely be able to more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers and create more achievements. This naturally does not mean that welfare services that require large investments should be carried out regardless of conditions, but that things that are possible and must be done well should be done well. This will link the movement to increase production and practice economy with the vital interests of the masses, and will make the movement more in-depth and more lasting.
    Finally, I hope that some of our leading organs, especially the leading organs in Beijing, can come down more often to see and understand the living conditions of the masses, and have a deeper experience of the joys and sorrows of the masses. If we can do this, then we may be more active in considering and solving the problems of the vital interests of the masses, and the bureaucracy that disregards the suffering of the masses may be eliminated more quickly in enterprises.

    关心群众疾苦永不过时	本报记者　金雨困
    据辽宁地区工会反映，最近有一些单位，在增产节约的借口下，随便斧削职工群众必要的福利事业。
    仅从一些零星的材料，也可以看出这个问题已具有相当的普遍性。本溪煤矿根据上级指示，要全部取消原来由行政费开支的食堂和托儿所工作人员的工资，改由福利补助金中开支。这一取消，对维持和举办必要的福利事业造成了极大困难。因为今年全矿的福利补助金仅有四十万元，而上述人员的工资就需四十六万，全部作工资开支也还不够。有的单位把削减职工福利作为增产节约的主要手段。据某单位工会主席汇报：这个单位的行政领导在“工会犯了严重的经济主义错误”和去年赔钱是由于“生活改善过多”的帽子下，计划用提高定额的办法降低工资5％，同时降低医药和劳保费用。这个单位计划增产节约九十四万元，其中很大部分是削减职工福利所得。当然，如果去年职工福利确有过高之处，也可以和群众商量修正，但是绝不能以此为增产节约的主要方面，否则必然会引起混乱。有的地方把应该办又必需办的福利也随便停办和收缩了。瓦房店纺织厂原有两个食堂，一个是布厂的，最多时有七八百人吃饭；一个是纱厂的，有千余人吃饭。为了精简人员，这个厂将布厂的食堂取消了，布厂职工要吃的饭菜，就由一里多地外的纱厂食堂用推车送去，结果布厂的职工只能天天吃凉饭凉菜，同时又增加了拥挤程度，职工极为不满。有万余职工的大伙房水库工地，为了节约，把主要住宅区工人村原有的五个大水壶减至三个，弄得单身工人喝不上开水。有的单位过多地削减安全劳保设施，弄得起码的劳动条件都不能保障。某钢厂烧结车间打算削减二十一大项安全设施，这个车间每天跑大量粉尘，可是这次竟要把解决粉尘的除尘器和通风设备都削去。
    目前，在某些地方，上述的情况正在形成一股风，而且这股风又有许多是从北京吹来的。前边所举的例子有些就与北京的领导机关有直接关系。从这里也反映了某些企业的领导人员往往只是看风办事，去年看到上边强调关心职工生活，于是就奉命“改善职工生活”，有的地方甚至把好事做成了傻事。今年认为风向已“变”，就来了个一百八十度的大转弯，“增产节约”“艰苦朴素”又成了他们忽视群众生活的挡箭牌。所谓“生活改善太多”啦“好事办得太集中”啦，“经济主义倾向”啦，“要求过高”“影响工农联盟”啦等等说法又流行起来了。
    对于这种种说法，应该加以实事求是的分析。职工生活的改善只能是渐进的，特别是限于国家的财力物力，不可能把好事一下子都办起来。去年这里的好事确实办得集中了一些，如工资增长、公用事业和房租收费及日用品价格的调整、对部分生活困难的职工进行救济和帮助还债等等。但是，不集中办并不等于不办。完全不办就会严重地脱离群众。如果因为去年好事办得太集中，今年就一律不办了，那就要犯另一方面的错误。部分职工对生活福利要求过高也是有的。但是，只要很好地对他们进行思想教育，问题是不难解决的。就我所知，沈阳一些工厂将生活福利问题交给职工代表大会讨论时，大家都能本着节约精神来合理的处理。而实际上，目前许多没有解决的问题是能够办到而没有办到的。
    因此我认为目前值得注意防止的问题，主要倒不是群众的经济主义倾向和过高的要求（当然，这方面的教育仍然是需要的）；而是某些不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义又有了滋长。但是，目前宣传教育工作的锋芒往往都是针对前者而很少是后者。不久前从抚顺回来的辽宁省工会的同志谈，据他们调查，目前许多没有办到的有关生活福利的事情，绝大部分并不是由于客观条件不容许。譬如，有的企业的厕所无人管理，冬天冻得一层又一层，要拉屎只能站着不能蹲着，甚至还要排队。有的地方男女合用一个厕所，女同志上厕所要有人放哨。这些问题长期不能解决，现在工人要求解决，难道能认为要求过高吗？职工要求喝点开水，这是最起码的要求吧，特别是在高温作业的地方。但是，有的企业偏偏长期拖着不给解决。辽宁省工会的同志在抚顺钢厂炼钢车间时，工人拉着要他们尝尝车间里的开水，他们一尝，才知道水里都是灰尘、油腻和一股铁腥味。这样的脏水怎么能叫工人喝得下去呢？要喝点干净开水，难道也是由于国家投资问题而不能解决吗？再说吃饭，人人要吃饭，天天要吃饭，但是有很多企业的职工却吃不好饭。有的食堂在这个窗口卖饭，在那个窗口卖菜，在另一个窗口卖汤，工人吃顿饭得排三次队。至于工人吃冷饭冷菜那就更为普遍了。难道排队、吃冷饭也是不可克服的困难吗？也必须让大家长期忍受以服从长远利益吗？为什么这些起码而又可能解决的问题不能解决？这是由于有些领导人员很少深入到群众中去，对群众的疾苦知道得很少，而他们自己吃的不是冷饭，拉屎不仅不用排队，而且有设备良好的厕所；喝的不仅不是脏水，而是干净的自来水还要加点茶叶。所以，他们虽然也听到了工人的呼声，看到存在的问题，但仍然熟视无睹，得过且过，这个月推到下个月，对群众的疾苦漠不关心到了麻木的程度。作为共产党员的领导人员，还有什么比这种思想上脱离群众的倾向更危险和更可怕的呢？
    我们经常教育职工群众要以厂为家，但是工厂的领导人员自己首先没有把职工群众当成自家人，不关心他们的衣食住行、油米酱醋。既然他们是他们，我们是我们，为什么群众一定要把你看成一家人呢？为什么一定要把这样的工厂当作自己的家呢？当然，由于我们的职工群众具有很高的觉悟，并没有因为某些领导人员的官僚主义而消极起来，他们仍然积极地工作和生产着。但是，如果我们能够更好地关心群众的生活疾苦，那么，在增产节约运动中，就一定能够更充分地把职工的积极性调动起来，创造出更多的成绩。这自然不是说应该不顾条件去举办需要大量投资的福利事业，而是应该把可能而必须办好的事情办好。这样使增产节约运动同群众的切身利益联系起来，便会使运动开展得更深入更持久。
    最后，希望我们的一些领导机关，特别是北京的领导机关的人，能够多下来看看，了解了解群众的生活状况，对群众的苦乐有更深的体验。如果能够这样，那么在考虑解决群众切身利益问题时就可能更积极些，那些漠视群众疾苦的官僚主义也许就会更快地在企业中消除。
