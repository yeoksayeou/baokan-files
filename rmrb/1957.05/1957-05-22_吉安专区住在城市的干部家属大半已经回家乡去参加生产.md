Xinhua News Agency Report:
    Most of the family members of cadres in the Jian Special District, Jiangxi, who lived in cities, have returned to their hometowns to participate in labor production after being mobilized. The Jian District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jian Special Commissioner's Office have a total of 160 cadre families returning to the countryside for production, accounting for 64% of the total number of cadre households in the offices. In all twelve counties and Jian City, the percentage of cadre family members returning to the countryside is above 60%.

    Most of these returning cadre family members are middle-aged women and landlords and rich peasants with labor ability who originally engaged in production in the local rural areas, and they had no jobs in the cities and government offices. In the past, farmers had many opinions about these cadre family members entering cities and living in government offices, saying that "being a cadre means having money, marrying a cadre means enjoying a good life." Some farmers said: "Cadres preach to us that labor is glorious, but they just don't teach their own family members to labor." The parents, brothers, or sisters-in-law of cadre family members in the countryside were also dissatisfied with them leaving their families and abandoning production. Now that these people have returned to participate in production, the masses and families have responded very well. After the wife of Liu Fengzhao, a cadre of the Yongxin County Grain Bureau, returned home, she immediately raised two pigs and picked manure with the women in the agricultural cooperative. The wife of Liu Tianhua, a cadre of the Yongxin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, participated in field labor after returning home, and earned eighty-eight work points in eleven days. Some cadre family members in Jian County who returned home to participate in production have achieved success in production and have been elected as cooperative cadres by the members. Some cadre family members who have no home in the local rural areas or have difficulty returning home to participate in production have also joined the labor production of nearby agricultural cooperatives, or grow their own vegetables and raise pigs. Now the masses say: The government's mobilization of cadre family members to return home for production is really a triple win: one is conducive to the production of cooperatives, the second is to reduce the economic burden on cadres, and the third is to increase family income.

    After these cadre family members returned home to participate in production, those cadre family members who had originally planned to enter the city have now changed their minds and decided to work diligently in the countryside.

    吉安专区住在城市的干部家属
    大半已经回家乡去参加生产
    新华社讯　江西吉安专区住在城市的机关干部家属，经过动员后，已大部分回家参加劳动生产。中共吉安地委和吉安专署回乡生产的干部家属共一百六十户，占机关干部总户数的64％。全区十二个县和吉安市回乡的干部家属在60％以上。
    这些回家的干部家属，大多数是原来在当地农村从事生产的中年妇女和有劳动能力的地主、富农，他们在城市和机关里没有工作。过去，农民对这部分干部家属进城市住机关很有意见，说“当干部有钱，嫁干部享福”。有的农民说：“干部对我们宣传劳动光荣，可是偏偏不教自己的家属劳动”。干部家属们在农村的父母、兄弟或妯娌，对她（他）们离开家庭、脱离生产也不满意。现在这些人重新回家参加生产，群众和家庭反映都很好。永新县粮食局干部刘凤兆的妻子回家后，立即喂养了两头猪，并且和农业社里的妇女一起拣粪。中共永新县委会干部刘天华的妻子回家参加田间劳动，十一天便做了八十八个工分。吉安县回家生产的干部家属，有的在生产中做出成绩，被社员选为社干部。有些在当地农村无家或回家生产有困难的干部家属，也就地参加了附近农业社的劳动生产，或者自己种菜、养猪。现在群众说：政府动员干部家属回家生产，真是一举三得，一有利于合作社的生产，二可以减轻干部经济负担，三可以增加家庭收入。
    这些干部家属回家生产后，原来准备进城的干部家属现在都改变主意，决定安心在农村劳动。
