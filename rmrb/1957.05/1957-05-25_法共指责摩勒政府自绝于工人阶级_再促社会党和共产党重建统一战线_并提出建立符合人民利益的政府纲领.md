Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: According to TASS, Paris, May 23rd: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the current government crisis, saying that adhering to the promises made during the election campaign is the main condition for establishing a stable government. However, the Mollet government intensified the Algerian war, abandoning the program supported by the people.

The French Communist Party said: "The government's policy is the same as that of the reactionary parties defeated in the election in the main aspects, and it has further strengthened this policy. The government temporarily obtained the support of the reactionary parties, and isolated itself from the working class and its party, and isolated itself from the people's forces and progressive forces. ... The ruling authorities have torn up the agreement reached with the people, which is the main and profound cause of the crisis."

The French Communist Party proposed a program for establishing a government in line with national interests: a ceasefire in Algeria, a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue, a struggle against isolating France internationally, increased wages and pensions, curbing inflation, suppressing fascist bandits, and respecting democratic freedoms and the secular nature of the state.

The French Communist Party reiterated that the common action of the working class, the united front of socialists and communists, and the unity of all democratic and national forces are the means by which the people can have their will respected.

The French Communist Party believes that the current government crisis can be resolved by acting in accordance with the wishes expressed by the people on January 2, 1956. It solemnly declares that it will actively act now and in the future to promote the emergence of a government in France that can implement a program of peace and progress according to the wishes of the people.

    法共指责摩勒政府自绝于工人阶级
    再促社会党和共产党重建统一战线
    并提出建立符合人民利益的政府纲领
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社巴黎23日讯：法国共产党中央委员会政治局就目前的政府危机发表声明说，信守竞选时提出的诺言是建立一个稳定的政府的主要条件。而摩勒政府变本加厉地进行阿尔及利亚战争，是抛弃了为人民所拥护的纲领。
    法国共产党说：“政府的政策在主要的方面同在选举中被击败的反动党派的政策一样，而且更加加强了这种政策。政府暂时地得到反动党派的支持，而自绝于工人阶级及其政党，自绝于人民力量和进步力量。……当权者撕毁了同人民达成的协议，这是造成危机的主要的和深刻的原因。”
    法国共产党提出建立一个符合民族利益的政府的纲领：在阿尔及利亚停火，和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，为反对使法国在国际上趋于孤立而斗争，提高工资和年金，制止通货膨胀，镇压法西斯匪徒，尊重民主自由和国家的非宗教性质。
    法国共产党再一次声明：工人阶级的共同行动，社会党人和共产党人的统一战线，一切民主力量和民族力量的团结：就是人民能够使他们的意志得到尊重的手段。
    法国共产党认为，按照1956年1月2日人民所表达的愿望行事，今天的政府危机是能够解决的。它郑重声明：现在和将来都将积极行动，促使法国产生一个能够根据人民的愿望实现和平和进步的纲领的政府。
