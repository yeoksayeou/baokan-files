Business and Industry Continue to Discuss Class Relations

(Reported by this newspaper) The joint symposium of business representatives convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Eighth Office of the State Council held its fifth session yesterday morning. The meeting continued discussions on the duality of the bourgeoisie and the question of whether class relations exist within the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC).

Su Keqin Believes Ma Chunlin's Criticism Is Not Comprehensive

Su Keqin, Secretary-General of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, continued his previous speech, expressing his feeling that the strength of the business and industrial community has not been fully utilized. He said that currently, some upper-level members of the business community in Wuhan have a sense of pride and complacency, which makes the masses of the business community reluctant to approach them; business families have many opinions among themselves; there are also rifts between capitalists and their agents, with capitalists feeling that their agents cannot represent their interests, and agents also having opinions about the capitalists; different types of enterprises are organized together, personnel arrangements are unfair, and they look down on each other; some elderly business people feel that the new society has nothing to do with them and are not active in matters; and a small number of business people with technical skills have not yet been mobilized. The existence of these phenomena illustrates the continued duality of the bourgeoisie itself and also indicates that the work of the ACFIC has not been done well and should be examined. At the same time, these phenomena are related to the "unification of the large but not the small, the left but not the right" in united front work, the lack of in-depth work, the narrow scope of contact, the failure to grasp the complexity of the bourgeoisie, and the failure to communicate the situation from below to above. He gave an example: some business people are good at observing facial expressions and acting according to the situation; some business people are more focused on hard work and are not good at superficial flattery; if one does not go deep, one cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood. He said: glass inherently refracts light, and if it is painted black, obscuring the light, people will not be able to enjoy the sunshine and warmth. He suggested that this kind of darkened glass should be cleaned first so that the masses of the business community can see the sunlight.

Then, he argued that Ma Chunlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, did not present a comprehensive criticism of Bi Mingqi last Saturday. He said that Bi Mingqi did not want the public side to withdraw from the enterprise, nor did he propose to break away from the leadership of the Party. He felt that the headline "Ma Chunlin disagrees with Bi Mingqi's opinion; the bourgeoisie is powerless without the leadership of the Party," used when People's Daily published Ma Chunlin's speech on May 19, was inappropriate. This label is too big and will discourage everyone from speaking out. He believes that helping the Party to rectify its work, all statements are sincere and out of love for the Party. If one takes things out of context, one will be either on the left or on the right.

Shou Moqing said:

The Personnel Department Should Become the Focus of Rectification

Class Relations Still Exist Within the ACFIC

Shou Moqing, Deputy Director of the General Office of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, spoke next, believing that the high walls and deep trenches between the Party and the masses are closely related to the national personnel system and the work style of cadres. To dismantle the walls and fill the trenches, it is necessary to change the national personnel system and the work style of personnel cadres. He said: those who do personnel work now are Party and League members, and most of them are young cadres. They are young, have cold faces, and are far away from the masses. They have learned a set of mature and prudent appearances but do not understand human relationships. I think these young people are not suitable for doing personnel work. Personnel work should be openly placed under the supervision of the masses, but the current personnel department has become a confidential department of government agencies and enterprises, becoming a "special" department that the masses cannot supervise. The personnel department should contact the masses, care for the masses, and integrate with the masses, but the current personnel department only cares about investigating history and does not care about the lives of the masses. Some people are "all-powerful and violate laws and regulations," making people fearful. In this way, the personnel department has become a "grievance office" for the masses and a wall and ditch between the Party and the masses. The personnel department of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is no exception.

Therefore, he believes that the personnel department should undergo necessary reforms in terms of organization, tasks, and working methods. First, the personnel system of government agencies and enterprises where the general anti-espionage work has ended should be completely open, so that "the virtuous are in position and the capable are in office," and Party members, League members, or the masses should be treated equally. Second, the appointment, removal, and transfer of personnel should have a system of requesting instructions and approvals. Third, non-Party cadres should participate in personnel work, and the masses should be able to supervise it; otherwise, bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism will inevitably arise. This rectification should focus on the personnel department in every government agency. The personnel work of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce also has problems; don't think that "everything is fine."

At this time, Minister Li Weihan asked Huang Jieran, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce: "Are the personnel departments there also all Party and League members?" Deputy Secretary-General Huang said: "Probably! I don't know much about it." Minister Li Weihan said: "Go back and find out. Give everyone an explanation." Then he said: "Why do Party and League members have to do personnel work? I don't think it's necessary."

When talking about how the working class views the bourgeoisie, Shou Moqing expressed a bit of disagreement with Bi Mingqi's view that "whoever tied the bell must untie it." He said: in the past, there was hatred between classes, which is a fact. This hatred was caused by the capitalist exploitation system, not fabricated by the working class and the Communist Party. Since the capitalist system, that is, the capitalists themselves, tied the bell in the past, the key to changing the working class's perception of the bourgeoisie still lies with the capitalists themselves. He believes that there has been more encouragement and less criticism of capitalists since the high tide.

Finally, he talked about the issue of class relations. He affirmed that class relations still exist within the ACFIC. He said: since the socialist revolution has achieved great victories, the class relations in our country have undergone fundamental changes, and the "antagonistic" relationship has become a "non-antagonistic" relationship. In the future, the distance between classes will gradually shorten, the differences between classes will gradually decrease, and the bourgeoisie will gradually be eliminated. However, before classes are eliminated, class relations will continue to exist. Even after classes are eliminated, the differences in people's positions, viewpoints, and ideological consciousness will remain for a long time.

He disagrees with some people who believe that there are no class relations within the ACFIC. He said: first, the ACFIC is not a people's organization of a single class but a people's organization jointly composed of various business people. Here, there are both the working class and the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. That is to say, there is not only the relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie but also the relationship between the working class and the petty bourgeoisie. The so-called public-private relationship, the so-called large, medium, and small relationships, are the specific manifestations of this class relationship. Second, the leadership structure of the ACFIC includes members of various class components. Third, a basic task of the ACFIC is to represent the legitimate interests of business people, which in essence represents the legitimate interests of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. This interest can be unified with the interests of the working class under the principle of socialist unity, but some issues not only involve the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class but also the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. Currently, employees do not understand the redemption policy enough, and small and medium-sized business people also have opinions on the "both fame and profit" of large households, while some capitalist business people believe that fixed interest should be extended to twenty years. These are all specific manifestations of class relations in politics and economics. It can be seen that class relations within the ACFIC are objectively existent, and adjusting class relations is the special task of the ACFIC. Otherwise, its nature and tasks will undergo fundamental changes.

Deng Jixing Suggests That the "Redemption Money" Be Paid by the State Treasury, Which She Believes Can Solve Internal Contradictions in Joint Ventures

The third speaker was Deng Jixing, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Women's Work Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association. She believes that the current contradictions between public and private, employee and private, and private and private in joint ventures, especially the deep trenches and high walls between public and private and employee and private, are mainly caused by the "fixed interest" system as redemption money. Because the private side of the joint venture still holds shares in their own enterprises and still receives "fixed interest" every three months based on the shares in their own enterprises, even if class relations are no longer emphasized, class relations are obviously existent. She said: since the "fixed interest" is an expenditure as the state's redemption of private enterprises and for the purpose of carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction, and this expenditure must be paid regardless of whether the enterprise has a surplus, why can't it be paid by the state treasury in a one-time redemption? In this way, business people can participate in work purely as staff members, and the many contradictions within the enterprise can be resolved. Based on the above reasons, she referred to the Czechoslovakian Nationalization of Industrial and Mining Enterprises Ordinance promulgated in 1945 and suggested that the government issue "Nationalization Bonds of Joint Public-Private Enterprises" to recover all the shares of joint ventures that have been fixed in value, and then convert the joint ventures into state-owned enterprises or local state-owned enterprises. The total amount of bonds issued can be set at 600 to 800 million yuan based on the state's financial resources, with no interest and no income tax. The bonds can be redeemed every six months and repaid in five or seven years. She disagreed with Li Kangnian's suggestion of a fixed interest of twenty years, saying that the redemption price is of a preferential nature, the state's financial resources are limited, and paying 2.2 billion is unreasonable. Moreover, dragging the fixed interest for another twenty years is not good for anyone, and small and medium-sized households are unwilling to do so. However, she believes that the spirit of Li Kangnian's suggestion can be adopted. She believes that using nationalization bonds has the following four benefits. First, the term "private side" no longer exists, and business people work in state-owned enterprises entirely as public officials, and their enthusiasm and creativity can be fully exerted. The internal contradictions of the enterprise are simplified, which is conducive to unity. Second, the procedures for paying "fixed interest" once every three months can be eliminated, which can greatly save manpower, and it is also convenient for bondholders. Third, it can simplify the economic accounting methods of enterprises. The economic accounting methods of joint ventures are different from those of state-owned enterprises because of the expenditure of fixed interest, and the percentages of welfare funds and bonus funds are also different. After the conversion to state-owned enterprises, the private side no longer receives fixed interest from the enterprise, and the economic accounting methods of the enterprise are the same as those of state-owned enterprises, which facilitates unified leadership. Fourth, it is more conducive to the transformation of business people. For example, small and medium-sized households can choose not to take it if they don't want it, or give it to others, or give it to the ACFIC as a mutual aid fund, thereby removing the label of "capitalist." Large households can cut off their tails and no longer have the hope of extending the fixed interest. Finally, she said: of course, the completion of economic transformation does not mean that ideological transformation is also completed; that is another matter.

Huang Yingmin Believes:

Bi Mingqi Overestimates the Progressiveness of the Bourgeoisie

Huang Yingmin, Secretary-General of the Guizhou Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, focused on expressing different views on Bi Mingqi's speech on May 17. He believes that Bi Mingqi overestimated the progressiveness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and underestimated the backwardness of the national bourgeoisie, seeing more of the positive aspects and not seeing or seeing less of the negative aspects.

He believes that the national bourgeoisie currently exists vividly in Chinese society. Many of the people present are members of the national bourgeoisie. Since the national bourgeoisie exists, class relations also exist in joint ventures. Since the national bourgeoisie exists, its duality also exists.

He believes that mentioning the duality of the national bourgeoisie now refers to the attitude of the Chinese national bourgeoisie toward the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and its performance in various historical periods. Xu Dixing pointed out those positive and negative manifestations in his speech at the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Those are all facts, not simply imposing negative things on the national bourgeoisie. Those factual behaviors, whether positive or negative, are all governed by people's thoughts. He said that the positive aspects are currently the mainstream and are growing. This is the result of the Party's education and training over the years, as well as the self-efforts of the bourgeoisie members, accepting socialist things in their thinking and excluding some capitalist things. He gave an example, saying that some members of the national bourgeoisie are currently causing disunity, competing for fame and profit, being proud and complacent, and refusing to accept each other. What are these if not reflections of bourgeois ideology? Do these reflections play a positive or negative role in work? Do they promote work or hinder it? For example, in joint ventures, some public and private parties have poor relations. Does the private side have no responsibility at all? He believes that it is unfair to put the responsibility for the poor relationship between the public and private parties entirely on the public side. Problems in the relationship between the public and private parties reflect the struggle between socialist and capitalist ideologies. Some people say that there are also negative things such as competition for fame and profit and even corruption among workers, but this is not the essence of the working class but a reflection of being influenced by the bourgeoisie. These are two different things and should not be equated.

Some people say that the Chinese national bourgeoisie entered socialism with gongs and drums, which is a manifestation of the progressiveness of the national bourgeoisie. This is a fact. He specifically cited the example of the Guiyang area, saying that this performance is precisely the result of the Party's implementation of the policy of unity and transformation toward the national bourgeoisie.

After the speech of Huang Yingmin, Secretary-General of the Guizhou Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department welcomed everyone's criticisms of the united front work. He said that the Communist Party members in the business community should open their doors, check some problems, and immediately improve what should be changed.

Finally, Minister Li Weihan proposed: some people mentioned in their speeches that there are still progressive, intermediate, and backward, left, middle, and right people in the business community. Is this the case? If so, how should we view it and how should we analyze it? These all need further discussion. Whether there are class relations within the ACFIC is also a very meaningful debate. I hope everyone will freely express their opinions.

This symposium will continue today.

### 工商界继续讨论阶级关系

    工商界继续讨论阶级关系
    本报讯　昨天上午，中共中央统战部和国务院第八办公室联合召开的工商界座谈会，举行第五次座谈。会上继续就资产阶级两面性和工商联内部有没有阶级关系问题展开了讨论。苏克勤认为马春霖的批评不全面
    武汉市工商联秘书长苏克勤继续上次发言，他感到工商界的力量还没有全部发挥出来。他说，目前，在武汉有部分工商界上层分子有骄傲自满情绪，使工商界群众不愿接近；工商界家属互相之间有不少意见；资方和资方代理人之间也有隔阂，资方认为资方代理人不能代表自己的利益，资方代理人对资方也有意见；不同性质的企业组织在一起，人员安排不平摆，互相瞧不起；有些老年工商业者认为新社会与自己无关，遇事也不积极；少数工商业者中有技术的人员，也还未发动起来。这些现象的存在，说明了资产阶级本身仍存在两面性，也说明了工商联的工作没有作好，应该进行检查。同时，这种现象和统战工作中的统大不统小、统左不统右、工作不够深入、接触面太窄、没有掌握资产阶级的复杂性、下情没有上达等有关。他举例说：有些工商业者善于察颜观色，看风驶船；有些工商业者就比较埋头苦干，不善于表面迎合；如果不深入，就辨别不了真伪。他说：玻璃本来就有折光，如果再涂上黑颜色，把光线遮掩起来，就会使人享受不到阳光和温暖。他建议把这种黑影玻璃先刷干净，使广大工商界的群众都能看到阳光。
    接着，他认为沈阳工商联副秘书长马春霖在上星期六对毕鸣岐的批评不够全面，他说，毕鸣岐并没有要公方退出企业，更没有提出脱离党的领导。5月19日人民日报上刊载马春霖的发言时用“马春霖不同意毕鸣岐的意见，资产阶级离开了党的领导是无能为力的”的标题，是不妥当的，这帽子太大了，会使大家不敢鸣。他认为帮助党整风，发言都是真诚的，是出于对党的爱护，如果断章取义，就会非左即右。寿墨卿说：
    人事部门应该成为整风的重点
    工商联内部仍有阶级关系存在
    接着发言的是全国工商联办公室副主任寿墨卿，他认为党群之间的高墙深沟同国家人事制度以及干部作风有极重要的关系，要拆墙填沟，就要改变国家的人事制度和人事干部的工作作风。他说：现在做人事工作的都是党团员，而且多数是青年干部，他们年纪轻轻的，面孔冷冷的，同群众离得远远的，他们学会一套老成持重的样子，却不懂人情世故，我认为这些年青人做人事工作是不适宜的。人事工作应该公开的放在群众监督之下，而现在的人事部门却成为机关企业的保密部门，成为一种“特殊”的部门，群众无从监督。人事部门应该联系群众、关心群众，同群众打成一片，而现在的人事部门只管追查历史，却不关心群众生活，有的人“权大无边，违法乱纪”，使人望而生畏。这样，人事部门就成为群众的“怨府”，成为党和群众之间的墙和沟。全国工商联的人事部门也不能例外。
    因此，他认为人事部门应从组织上、任务上以及工作方法上进行必要的改革。第一、一般肃反工作已经结束的机关企业人事制度完全公开，使“贤者在位，能者在职”，不管党员、团员或群众都要平等看待。第二、人事任免调动要有请示批核制度。第三、人事工作应该让非党干部参加，而且应该让群众有可能进行监督，否则，必然要产生官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义。这次整风，人事部门应该是每个机关的重点。全国工商联的人事工作也是有问题的，不要以为“太平无事”。
    这时，李维汉部长问全国工商联合会副秘书长黄玠然：“你们那里人事部门是不是也都是党团员哪”？黄副秘书长说：“差不多吧！我不太了解。”李维汉部长说：“回去了解了解。向大家作个交代，”接着又说：“为什么非要党团员来做人事工作呢？我看没有必要。”
    谈到工人阶级怎样看待资产阶级问题的时候，寿墨卿表示对毕鸣岐提到解铃还是系铃人的看法有一点意见。他说：过去阶级之间有仇恨，是事实，这个仇恨是资本主义剥削制度造成的，并不是工人阶级和共产党捏造出来的。既然过去系铃人是资本主义制度，也就是资本家自己，那么现在要改变工人阶级对资产阶级的观感，主要还在于资本家自己。他认为高潮以来各方面对资本家鼓励多了，而对资本家的批评少了。
    最后，他谈到阶级关系问题，他肯定地认为在工商联内部仍有阶级关系存在。他说：从社会主义革命取得了伟大的胜利以后，我国阶级关系发生了根本的变化，“对立”的关系已经变为“非对立”的关系，今后阶级之间的距离将逐渐缩短，阶级之间的差别将逐渐减少，资产阶级将逐步消灭，但是，在阶级没有消灭以前，阶级关系仍将继续存在，即使在阶级消灭以后，人们在立场、观点以及思想意识上的差别，也还会长期保留着。
    他不同意某些人认为工商联内部没有阶级关系的说法。他说：第一、工商联不是单一阶级人民团体，而是各类工商业者联合组成的人民团体。这里，既有工人阶级，也有资产阶级和小资产阶级。这就是说，这里不仅有工人阶级同资产阶级的关系，还有工人阶级同小资产阶级的关系，所谓公私关系，所谓大、中小关系，就是这种阶级关系的具体表现。第二、在工商联的领导机构中包含着各种阶级成分的成员。第三、工商联的一项基本任务是代表工商业者的合法利益，实质上代表资产阶级与小资产阶级的合法利益，这种利益，在社会主义一致的原则下可以同工人阶级利益统一起来，但在有些问题上不仅涉及到资产阶级同工人阶级之间的关系，而且还涉及到资产阶级同小资产阶级的关系。目前，职工对赎买政策不够了解，中小工商业者对于大户的“名利双收”也有意见，而某些资本主义工商业者认为定息应该延长到二十年，这些都是阶级关系在政治上经济上的具体表现。可见，工商联内部阶级关系是客观存在，调节阶级关系是工商联的特殊任务，否则，它的性质和任务就要发生根本的变化。邓季惺建议由国库支付“赎买金”她认为这样可以解决合营企业内部矛盾
    第三个发言的是中国民主建国会中央委员、妇女工作委员会主任委员邓季惺。她认为现在合营企业的公私、职私、私私之间的矛盾，特别是公私之间、职私之间存在着深沟高垒的情况，主要是由于作为赎买金的“定息”制度造成的。因为现在合营企业的私方还持有本企业的股票，每三个月还要凭股票在本企业里领取“定息”，这样，纵使不再强调阶级关系，阶级关系也是显然存在的。她说：“定息”既然是作为国家赎买私营企业和为了进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设而支出的一笔费用，而且这笔费用又不管企业是否有盈余都要支付，那么，为什么不可以由国库支出，一次赎买呢？这样，可以使工商业者单纯以工作人员的身份参加工作，企业内部重重矛盾也就可以得到解决。根据以上理由，她参考了捷克斯洛伐克1945年颁布的工矿企业国有化条例，建议政府发行“公私合营企业国有化公债”，用这种公债把所有已经定股的合营企业股票收回，然后将合营企业改为国营企业或地方国营企业。公债发行的总额可根据国家的财力，订为六亿至八亿元，不给利息，不上所得税。公债可每半年兑换一次，分为五年或七年还清。她不同意李康年提的定息二十年的建议，她说，赎买给价是照顾性质的，国家财力有限，付给二十二亿是不合理的。而且定息再拖二十年，对各方面都没有好处，中小户也不愿意。但是，她认为李康年的建议精神是可以吸取的。她认为采用国有化公债有以下四个好处。一、“私方”一词不存在了，工商业者在国营企业中工作完全以公家人身份出现，积极性、创造性可以充分发挥，企业内部矛盾简化，有利于团结；二、免除现在三个月支付一次“定息”的手续，可以大大节省人力，持票人也便利；三、可以简化企业经济核算方法。现在合营企业的经济核算办法因有定息的支出，和国营企业不一样，福利金、奖励金的提成也不一样，改为国营后，私方不再由企业领取定息，企业经济核算办法和国营一样，便于统一领导；四、更利于工商业者的改造。如中、小户不愿意要的可不要，或送给旁人，或交给工商联作互助基金，从而摘掉“资本家”的帽子；大户可以割掉尾巴，对定息不再存有延长的希望。最后，她说：当然，经济上的改造完毕并不等于思想也改造好了，那是另一回事。黄英民认为：
    毕鸣岐对资产阶级进步性估价太高
    贵州省工商联秘书长黄英民着重对毕鸣岐在5月17日的发言提出了不同的看法。他认为毕鸣岐对中国民族资产阶级的进步性估计过高了，对民族资产阶级的落后性估计过低了，积极方面看得多了一些，消极方面没有看到或者看少了一些。
    他认为当前民族资产阶级在中国社会里是活生生地存在着的。在座的很多人都是民族资产阶级分子，民族资产阶级既然存在，在合营企业里阶级关系也就存在，民族资产阶级存在，它的两面性也就存在。
    他认为现在提民族资产阶级的两面性，是指中国民族资产阶级对中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命的态度，和在各个历史时期的表现说的。许涤新在全国工商联合会发言中就曾指出那些积极和消极面的表现。那些都是事实，并不是把消极的东西硬套在民族资产阶级身上。那些事实行为无论是积极的消极的都是通过人们的思想来支配的。他说当前积极方面是主流，而且正在上长。这是多年来党的教育培养，和资产阶级分子的自我努力，在思想上接受了社会主义的东西，排除了一些资本主义的东西，才取得的。他举例说，当前民族资产阶级分子中有些人闹不团结，争名夺利，骄傲自满，互不服气，这些不是资产阶级思想的反映又是什么呢？这些反映在工作中起积极作用还是起消极作用呢？是推动了工作呢，还是阻碍了工作呢？又如合营企业中，有些公私双方关系不好，难道私方一点责任都没有吗？他认为把公私共事关系搞得不好的责任，完全推到公方身上是不公平的。公私共事关系存在问题，正反映了社会主义思想与资本主义思想的斗争。有人说在工人中也有争名争利甚至贪污腐化等消极的东西，但不是工人阶级的本质，这也是受了资产阶级影响的反映。这是两回事，不应等同看待。
    有人说中国民族资产阶级敲锣打鼓进入社会主义，是民族资产阶级进步性的表现，这是事实。他特地举出贵阳地区的例子说，所以有这种表现，正是党对民族资产阶级贯彻了团结改造政策的结果。
    在贵州省工商联秘书长黄英民发言以后，统战部李维汉部长对大家在统战工作方面提出的批评表示欢迎，他表示，工商界的中共党员，应把大门敞开，有些问题要进行检查，应该改的立即改进。
    最后，李维汉部长提出：有些人在发言中提到目前工商界仍存在着进步的、中间的、落后的，左的、中的、右的。是不是这样？如果是这样，应该怎样看，怎样分析？这都需要进一步讨论。工商联内部有无阶级关系，对这个问题争论也很有意义，希望大家自由发表意见。
    这个座谈会，今天将继续进行。
