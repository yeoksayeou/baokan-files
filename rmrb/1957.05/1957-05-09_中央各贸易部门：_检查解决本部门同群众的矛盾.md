Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The Party organizations of the central trade departments will take the examination and resolution of contradictions between their departments and the broad masses of people—producers and consumers—as the main content of this rectification movement.

According to the analysis of the Party Group of the Ministry of Commerce of the CPC, the contradictions between the Ministry of Commerce and the outside world are manifested in four aspects: the contradiction between commodity supply and consumer needs, the contradiction between the central government and local governments in the distribution of materials, the contradiction between commerce and industry, and the contradiction between commerce and transportation and other departments. The exposure and resolution of these contradictions will become the main content of this rectification of the Party organization of the Ministry of Commerce.

The Party organization of the Urban Service Department will focus on examining the contradictions between the department and the broad masses—producers and consumers—as the center of the rectification. The rectification plan formulated by the Party Group of the Urban Service Department of the CPC focuses on examining the following points: In terms of relations with the masses, it is not only necessary to examine those measures that hinder the development of production, but also to examine whether active measures are taken to promote production from all aspects, cultivate sources of goods, increase farmers' income, and support and consolidate agricultural cooperativization; whether the work of the Urban Service Department implements the mass line, especially in the problems in formulating and implementing various procurement and supply price policies; whether the formulated policies, systems, and assigned tasks conform to objective reality and whether democracy has been promoted; whether there is sectarianism in mobilizing and organizing all positive factors; whether there are phenomena in business management that unilaterally emphasize the interests of the unit and harm the interests of the people and the state.

The initial focus of the rectification proposed by the Party organization of the Ministry of Food is: to examine whether the formulation and implementation of various grain policies are correct, the contradictions caused by systemic problems in grain management; whether the mass line is implemented in grain work; whether the business management of grain enterprises conforms to the policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, and so on.

The Party Group of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of the CPC believes that at present, there are many contradictions between the supply and marketing cooperative system and farmers in terms of the quantity, price, and methods of purchasing agricultural products, and these contradictions need to be basically resolved in this rectification.

The Party organization of the Ministry of Foreign Trade plans to take the contradiction between domestic sales and foreign sales as the focus of the rectification.
