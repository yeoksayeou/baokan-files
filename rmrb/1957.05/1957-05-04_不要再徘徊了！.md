Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jianwei reports: During the current busy spring ploughing and sowing season, six high school graduates in the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative of Yuci County, Shanxi Province, who call themselves "wanderers," are not participating in production in their hometowns. Since September of last year, they have not participated in a single day of agricultural production, and are still wandering the streets of Taiyuan and Yuci, or staying at home quietly.

Why don't they return to their hometowns to produce and why are they unwilling to see people? According to a recent investigation by the reporter, it turns out that after graduating in the summer of 1955, they all returned to work in the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative. Most of them took on important tasks such as accountants, work point recorders, librarians, and kindergarten teachers, and made certain achievements, earning praise from leading cadres and members. However, last year, they felt that there was no "future" in the countryside, and that staying there for a long time would delay their youth. Some openly said that they were not earning enough money, and successively went to the city to take school exams or look for work. Unfortunately, none of their wishes were fulfilled. As a result, some wandered the streets doing odd jobs, some lived off relatives and friends, and some relied on remittances from their parents for a long time.

Now, some of them have been educated by the call of the Party and the government, and some have deeply felt that they have taken the wrong path from the painful experience of long-term wandering, and expressed their willingness to return to their hometowns to produce. However, many social obstacles and difficulties in front of them have put them in a dilemma. This urgently needs to attract the attention of relevant parties.

The reporter recently visited Zhou Bao'ai, who has already returned home. She is a strong nineteen-year-old youth. She told the reporter in detail about her concerns about returning home to produce: First, she was afraid that the villagers would stab her in the back (criticize and satirize her behind her back). Second, she was afraid of the indifference and exclusion of the leaders of the agricultural cooperative. Third, if her companions who went out did not return to their hometowns, she would be embarrassed to return alone. Fourth, her father said that if she couldn't find a job, she should find a partner in the city and get married. Zhou Bao'ai tried her best to conceal her inner anxiety in the conversation.

The reporter also visited Jiao Fuxing, the secretary of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative branch of the Communist Party of China. According to him, they have recently announced that they welcome them to return to the cooperative to participate in production as soon as possible. And try to make good placement preparations to clear obstacles for them to return home to produce.

    不要再徘徊了！
    新华社太原3日电　新华社记者冯建伟报道：在目前繁忙的春耕播种时期，山西省榆次县曙光农业社有六位自称“流浪者”的高小毕业生，却不在乡里参加生产。他们从去年9月以来，没有参加一天农业生产，至今仍流浪在太原、榆次街头，或者呆在家里悄悄坐着。
    他们究竟为什么不回乡生产和不愿见人呢？据记者最近调查，原来他们在1955年暑期毕业后，都回到曙光农业社工作。其中大部分担任了会计、记工员、图书管理员、幼儿园教师等重要任务，并且作出一定成绩，获得领导干部和社员们的赞扬。但是在去年，他们却感到农村没有“前途”，认为长久呆下去会贻误青春，有的公开说赚钱太少，陆续到城里去考学校或找工作去了。不巧，他们的愿望都没有实现。于是，有的流浪街头当短工作零活，有的寄食在亲友家，有的长期靠父母汇款养活。
    现在，他们之中有的已经从党和政府的号召中受到教育，有的从长期流浪的痛苦体验中深感自己走了错路，表示愿意回乡生产。只是摆在他们面前的许多社会障碍和困难，才使他们陷于进退维谷的境地。这一点亟需引起有关方面的注意。
    记者日前访问了已经回家的周宝爱，她是一个体格健壮的十九岁的青年。她向记者详述了回家生产的顾虑：第一是怕村里人背后挖脊梁骨（背后指着说讽刺话）。第二是怕农业社领导干部的冷淡和排斥。第三是外出同伴不回乡，她一人不好意思回来。第四是她的父亲说找不到工作就在城里找对象，要她出嫁。周宝爱在谈话中极力掩饰她内心的焦急。
    记者又访问了中共曙光农业社支部书记焦福星。据他说，他们最近已经宣布欢迎他们尽快地回社参加生产。并且设法作好安置准备，为他们回家生产扫清障碍。
