    Preventing Potential Extraordinary Floods
      Jiang Huaiyu, Deputy Director of the Engineering Administration Bureau, Ministry of Water Resources
    According to predictions and analysis from relevant departments, there is still a possibility of extraordinary floods occurring in various regions this year. Currently, rainfall has been widespread in several southern provinces, with some areas experiencing heavy rainfall exceeding that of the same period last year. Flood control efforts in certain rivers are already quite strained. To ensure a bumper harvest this year, all regions need to heighten their vigilance and swiftly implement flood control measures.
    What aspects should be emphasized in this year's flood control work? We believe:
    I. It is necessary to prepare for the worst-case scenario and make preparations for defending against extraordinary floods. At present, many fundamental river management projects have not yet been completed and cannot prevent extraordinary floods. To avoid dike breaches and expanded disasters, all regions must proactively consider countermeasures and make preparations based on existing projects. Dike repair and reinforcement, as well as inspection and maintenance of culverts and sluices, should be carried out promptly according to plan before the flood season. If flood control organizations have not yet been established, they should be established immediately to ensure centralized leadership in this work. The organization of flood control teams should be combined with agricultural production, and labor should be allocated in a planned manner. Flood control materials should also be adequately stocked to prevent being caught off guard.
    II. Our country has already built some large reservoirs, flood storage areas, and sea-bound diversion channels, which can intercept and divert a portion of floodwaters during the flood season. However, the released floodwaters still need to be defended against by dikes. However, most dikes were repaired and reinforced based on the original dilapidated state before liberation, and pest hazards have not been completely eliminated, making them prone to accidents when resisting higher floods. Therefore, strengthening dike defense is extremely important. All regions should conduct pre-flood season inspections, mobilize the masses, strive to eliminate hidden dangers in the dike body, and strengthen the dike body to improve its quality. In the event of an emergency, the cause should be identified first, advanced rescue techniques should be used, and rescue efforts should be carried out decisively. Efforts should also be made to seize the gaps between flood peaks to carry out consolidation and reinforcement work.
    III. Every year during the flood season, the area inundated by continuous rainfall or concentrated heavy rainfall is larger than the area inundated by floods. To ensure a bumper harvest, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and strengthen drainage and waterlogging removal efforts. In drainage work, disputes often arise due to upstream and downstream competition. This year, the spirit of "considering both upstream and downstream interests, subordinating small interests to large interests, and taking care of small interests with large interests" should be followed. Problems should be resolved through unity, mutual concession, and sincere consultation, and active and close contact with each other. Only in this way can regional drainage work be carried out effectively and internal waterlogging disasters be reduced or avoided.
    IV. In the flood disasters of past years, mountain floods have caused significant losses to people, livestock, and property. In 1955, a single mountain flood in Xixia County, Henan Province, resulted in more than 180 deaths, which was a very serious loss. In areas susceptible to mountain floods, forecasts and transmissions of rainfall and water conditions should be carried out, and arrangements should be made for the relocation and resettlement of the masses. In late June 1956, Hubei Province experienced a rare mountain flood in history, affecting thirty-one counties. However, due to the sound flood control organizations in those areas and the timely transmission of heavy rainfall information, no major losses occurred. For example, after receiving rainfall information from the province, Enshi Prefecture transmitted the information to the townships in one and a half hours. At the same time, emergency instructions were given to various places to transfer the elderly, weak, women, children, grain, and property to safe areas in advance, so people, livestock, and property were not lost. This example powerfully illustrates that it is entirely possible to reduce mountain flood disasters by actively taking defensive measures.
    V. Propaganda and education work should also be strengthened in flood control work to overcome complacency. We need to explain to the broad masses of cadres and people that the existing projects on various rivers in our country cannot fundamentally eliminate the threat of floods. Artificial efforts must be added to have the conditions to overcome flood disasters, and we cannot harbor a sense of complacency.
    VI. Finally, it is important to do a good job in engineering management and maintenance. Good routine management and maintenance can ensure the integrity of the projects and give full play to the flood control functions of existing projects. There are still serious phenomena of no one being responsible for many small culverts and sluices and some dikes; some are not used according to the design, damaging the buildings or causing losses to farmland. This should attract the attention of various regions and be improved immediately.

    预防可能出现的特大洪水
      水利部工程管理局副局长　蒋怀玉
    据有关方面的预测和分析，今年各地仍有可能出现特大洪水。现在，南方好几个省份已经普遍下雨，有些地区雨量很大，超过去年同期的雨量，某些河流的防汛工作已经相当紧张。为保证今年农业大丰收，各地都需要提高警惕，迅速作好防汛工作。
    今年的防汛工作应该注意哪些事呢？我们认为：
    一、要从最坏的情况出发，作好防御特大洪水的准备工作。目前，许多河道治本工程尚未完成，还不能御防特大洪水。为了避免堤防溃决，扩大灾害，各地必须在现有工程基础上预先考虑对策，作好准备。堤防的整修加固，涵闸的检查维修，要抓紧时机、按计划于汛前完成；尚未建立防汛机构的，要立即建立，使这个工作有集中的领导；防汛队伍的组织，要结合农业生产，有计划地调配劳力；防汛器材也要作适当的储备，以防措手不及。
    二、目前我国已经兴建了一些大的水库、蓄洪区和入海减河工程，在汛期可以拦蓄及分泄一部分洪水。但下泄的洪水还需要用堤防来防御。但大多数堤防是在解放以前原有的残破基础上培修的，而且害兽隐患尚未完全清除，在抗御较高洪水时容易发生险情。因此，加强堤防的防守工作是十分重要的。各地应当在这期间普遍进行汛前检查，发动群众，努力消灭堤身隐患，并加固堤身，提高堤防质量。如遇险情，应先判明发生原因，运用先进的抢险技术，果断地抢救。并且要抓紧洪峰间隙，进行整险加固工作。
    三、每年汛期由于雨水连绵或暴雨集中，被淹面积比洪水所淹面积还大。为了保障农业丰收，需要充分发动群众，加强排水除涝工作。在排水工作中，往往由于上下游你扒我堵，引起纠纷。今年应该本着“上下游兼顾，小利服从大利，大利照顾小利”的精神，本着团结互让，诚恳协商的态度，主动的相互密切联系去解决，只有这样才能作好地区间的排水工作，减免内涝灾害。
    四、在历年的洪水灾害中，山洪造成对人畜财产的损失是很大的。1955年河南省西峡县一次山洪死亡一百八十多人，损失是很严重的。在易受山洪冲刷的地区，应做好雨情、水情的预报和传递，并做好对群众的迁移安置工作。1956年6月下旬，湖北省发生了历史上少有的山洪，波及三十一个县，但由于那些地方健全了防汛机构，暴雨情报传递及时，没有发生重大损失。如恩施专区在接到省的降雨情报后，在一小时半的时间内就把情报传达到乡，同时紧急指示各地将老弱妇孺粮食财物等事先转移到安全地区，因此人畜财产未受损失。这一事例有力地说明，只要积极采取防御措施，减轻山洪灾害是完全可能的。
    五、在防汛工作中还应当加强宣传教育工作，克服麻痹思想。我们需要向广大干部和群众说明，我国各河流现有的工程还是不能根本解除洪水威胁的。还必须再加上人为的努力，才有条件战胜洪水灾害，不能存高枕无忧的心理。
    六、最后是要做好工程管理养护工作。经常性的管理养护工作做的好，就能够保证工程的完整，充分发挥已有工程的防洪作用。有不少的小型涵闸和有些堤防还严重地存在着无人负责现象；有的不按设计使用，损坏了建筑物，或使农田遭到损失。这应引起各地注意，立即改进。
