Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 30th: According to TASS reports from Paris, France is preparing to celebrate International Workers' Solidarity Day, "May Day," throughout the country. French workers, responding to the call of the French Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, and other progressive groups, are preparing to hold many mass rallies and gatherings to express their will to fight for improved economic conditions and protect democratic freedoms.
    "L'Humanité" published the French Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau's "May Day" message on April 29th. The Political Bureau pointed out that the Mollet government's policies are "clearing the way for fascism," and therefore it is dangerous for Socialists to even passively sympathize with the government's current policies.
    The Political Bureau called on all Communist Party members, all Party organizations, and all workers to actively participate in the "May Day" parade, with slogans such as raising wages, pensions, and allowances, improving working conditions, resisting the threats to freedom from reactionaries and fascists, striving to stop the Algerian War and recognize the Algerian people's right to independence, protecting peace, and striving to ban atomic weapons.

    响应法共和总工会号召
    法劳动人民筹庆“五一”
    新华社30日讯  据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国全国各地正在准备庆祝劳动者国际团结的日子“五一”节。法国劳动者响应法国共产党、总工会和其他进步团体的号召，准备举行许多群众大会和集会，来表示自己争取改善经济状况和保护民主自由的意志。
    “人道报”4月29日刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局的“五一”节文告。政治局指出摩勒政府的政策是“为法西斯主义扫清道路”，因此社会党员即使是消极地同情政府的现行政策也是危险的。
    政治局号召全体共产党员、所有党组织、全体劳动者积极参加“五一”节游行，口号是提高工资、抚恤金和津贴，改善劳动条件，抗击反动派和法西斯对自由的威胁，争取停止阿尔及利亚战争和承认阿尔及利亚人民独立的权利，保护和平和争取禁止原子武器。
