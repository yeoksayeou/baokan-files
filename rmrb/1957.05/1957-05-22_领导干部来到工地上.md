    Leading Cadres Arrive at the Construction Site

    That day, the sun was blazing, and the construction site was in the midst of intense work. We saw a group of people walking towards our construction site, including the bureau chief, manager, director, and the Party committee secretary.

    Everyone guessed: What are these "big shots" doing here?

    Some said: "No one goes to the temple without a reason. I bet someone got hurt or injured again."

    Some said: "If there was a major safety accident, would we not have heard about it? I'm sure some project is going to have major rework."

    Some disagreed: "Then – why didn't any technical cadres come with them? I think they're probably just going to some meeting."...

    Five minutes later, the truth came out.

    At the place where they were shoveling dirt, behind the carts pulling dirt, in the rows carrying dirt, there were a few more faces that especially attracted attention. The "big shots" were all sweating and working alongside everyone.

    One worker smiled and said to everyone: "This time, no one guessed right!"

    领导干部来到工地上
    那天，太阳晒着，现场正紧张施工。我们看见有一群人朝我们工地这儿走来，其中有局长、经理、主任，还有党委书记。
    大家就猜测：这些“头儿”们来干什么呢？
    有的说：“无事不登三宝殿。保险，又是哪单位摔坏人、砸伤人了。”
    有的说：“有啥大的安全事故，咱还能不透风的？没错，准是有工程又要大返工了。”
    有的不同意说：“那——为啥没跟来技术干部呢？我看，多半又是到哪儿去开会。”…………
    五分钟后，真相大白了。
    在铲土的地方，拉土的架子车后边，抬土的行列里，多了几张脸，格外吸引人的注意。“头儿”们都在流着汗跟大伙一块干活。
    有个工人笑着对大家说：“这回呀，谁都没有猜对！”
