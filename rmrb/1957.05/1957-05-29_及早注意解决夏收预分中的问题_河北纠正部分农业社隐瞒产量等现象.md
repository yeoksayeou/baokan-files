Pay Attention to Solving Problems in Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution Early
Hebei Corrects Phenomena Such as Some Agricultural Cooperatives Concealing Yields

Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 28th – In the process of implementing summer harvest pre-distribution work, some areas in Hebei Province experienced phenomena such as concealing and underestimating yields. For example, agricultural cooperatives in Qingyuan County reported only 400,000 mu of wheat planted this year, while last year they had 800,000 mu. In Fangshan County, the Nanzhuang and two other agricultural cooperatives also underreported 300 mu of cultivated land, and Xiacun falsely reported that 300 mu of wheat had been affected by disaster. It is understood that these cooperatives concealed land and underestimated yields with the consent of the cooperative cadres. They said: Concealing land can gain the support of the members; if we don't conceal land, the members will oppose us, so why offend the masses! Agricultural cooperatives such as Xiaonanzhuang in Jinghai County even planned to divide the cooperative's wheat fields in advance according to the population, allowing members to take some secretly, saying "If it's taken secretly, the government can't correct it back!" In addition, some agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly emphasized reducing deductions and distributing more, or deducting more and distributing less. Many linked-village cooperatives with more wheat planted insisted that the cooperative should not uniformly distribute grain, nor should it allow grain to be transferred out, while villages with less wheat planted insisted on unified distribution and payment according to labor.

After discovering the above situation, the local work teams promptly conducted careful analysis and research and came up with many solutions. For example, the issue of concealing and underestimating yields was due, on the one hand, to the fact that the psychological anxiety of the masses in disaster areas about food shortages had not yet been reversed, and on the other hand, some cooperatives had not yet taken appropriate action against those who concealed production, stole, and took advantage of others last year. The solution is to strengthen political and ideological education for cooperative cadres and members and to realistically resolve the legacy issues from last year. As for the economic contradictions between villages in linked-village cooperatives, the solution is unified distribution within the three-fixed quotas and village-level distribution outside the three-fixed quotas. In order to reduce the trouble of grain transfer, measures were also taken to deduct more public accumulation funds and public welfare funds from villages with more wheat fields, or to mobilize grain-deficient villages to buy grain from villages with surplus grain.

    及早注意解决夏收预分中的问题
    河北纠正部分农业社隐瞒产量等现象
    本报保定28日电　河北省部分地区在贯彻夏收预分工作中，曾经发生了隐瞒和低估产量等现象。如清苑县各农业社，去年种麦是八十万亩，现在却只报了四十万亩。房山县南庄等三个农业社，亦少报表田三百来亩，夏村还虚报了三百亩小麦受灾。据了解，这些社瞒田和低估产量，都是经过社干部同意的。他们说：瞒田能受到社员拥护，不瞒田社员就要反对，何必得罪群众呢！静海县小南庄等农业社，甚至计划把社里的麦田，根据人口多少，事先分好，让社员明抢暗收，并说什么“暗收了，政府纠也纠不回去”！此外，还有些农业社片面强调少扣多分或多扣少分；不少联村社种麦多的村，主张不让社里统一分配，也不让外调粮食，种麦少的村则坚持统一分配，按劳取酬。
    当地工作组发现上述情况后，都及时地进行了细致的分析研究，并想出许多办法进行解决。如隐瞒和低估产量的问题，一方面是由于灾区群众对粮食紧张的心理还未扭转过来，另一方面则是有些社对去年瞒产、偷盗和占了便宜的人，至今还未作适当的处理。解决办法是：加强对社干部和社员进行政治思想教育，并实事求是地解决去年的遗留问题。再如联村社村与村经济矛盾的问题，解决办法是：三定以内统一分配，三定以外归村分配。为减少调粮麻烦，还采取了从麦田多的村多扣公积金、公益金，或发动缺粮村到余粮村买粮等办法。
