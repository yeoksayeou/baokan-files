Professors at Hebei Higher Education Institutions
Criticize Educational Leadership

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, our reporter visited professors from some higher education institutions in Hebei, soliciting their opinions on the Ministry of Higher Education and school leadership, and discussing the contradictions in educational work.

    Liu Xuchu, a professor at Hebei Agricultural College, advocated restoring the credit system and percentage grading system in higher education institutions. He said that higher education institutions have made many changes in the teaching system in recent years, with significant side effects, mainly because the Ministry of Higher Education has serious dogmatism. They ignore the past traditions of Chinese education and mechanically apply some systems and methods. Of course, advanced Soviet experiences should be learned, and some have played a positive role in teaching. The problem is that when learning, one cannot ignore China's actual situation and forcibly promote them. For example, the teaching syllabus is designed for five years of study in the Soviet Union, but it is moved to China for four years of graduation. This in itself is a contradiction, leading to excessive burdens on students.

    For example, student grades were mostly based on the percentage system in the past, but after liberation, it was changed to a five-point system. This is suitable for the Soviet Union, but not for China.

    Also, Chinese universities mostly used the credit system in the past, and students graduated after completing the credits. In this way, outstanding students can graduate early, and slow students can extend their study time. This adapts to the different intellectual abilities of students and requires students to reach a certain level of graduation. Since liberation, the credit system has been abolished, and students graduate together regardless of their abilities. Even those who are clearly unqualified are reluctantly sent out, resulting in uneven quality.

    Of course, the percentage system and credit system are both systems of capitalist countries, but they have been transplanted to China for decades and have adapted to China's national conditions. Professor Liu Xuchu especially mentioned that he did not dare to say this before, fearing that he would be labeled with the "bourgeois ideology" hat.

    Elderly Teachers Have Made Progress
  Leaders Still View People with Old Eyes

    Hu Sidu, a lecturer at Tangshan Railway College, talked about subjectivism and sectarianism in higher education leadership. He said that before the Three-Anti Campaign, the bourgeois ideology of some older teachers was definitely very serious. The contradictions were exposed during the Three-Anti Campaign, and after several years of political movements, the thinking of many old teachers has progressed. However, the school leaders still view people with old eyes. The school promotes the line of young teachers, while alienating experienced teachers, and separating from the basic masses. These young teachers lack experience but shoulder the important responsibility of teaching reform, which is truly frightening. A teacher in the Mechanical Engineering Department once compressed and modified the Soviet teaching syllabus issued by the ministry. He handed it over to the young comrade in charge of academic affairs and said that it exceeded the students' load capacity by one-sixth, hoping that he would strive to reduce it at the ministry. As a result, this young comrade, unaware of the hardships of teaching, not only did not reduce one-sixth after attending a meeting at the ministry, but increased it by 8%. As a result, courses have been simplified every year since 1953, and many students have become ill.

    Tao Xueyu, a lecturer at Hebei Agricultural College, believes that their school also has this phenomenon. No matter what happens in the teaching and research group, old teachers must always seek the opinions of young comrades first. They are the leaders in every movement, which makes these young comrades grow arrogant and complacent, believing that the old teachers have nothing to offer, while making the old teachers feel more inferior, creating an abnormal relationship between new and old teachers.

    This is, in fact, a reflection of sectarianism, because these young comrades are mostly Party and League members. Hu Sidu also mentioned that all four presidents and vice presidents of Tangshan Railway College are Party members, and they are all Party members sent by the Ministry of Railways. The teachers had proposed that a professor be the president, but it has not been approved for two years. Hu Sidu believes that the leaders of the Ministry of Railways do not understand the temperament of intellectuals. They hope that a professor will be the president, just as ethnic minorities have their own people as the chairman of the autonomous region. In addition, at Tangshan Railway College, a non-Party academic affairs director had a dispute with the president. The Party member president said sternly, "If you insist, you have to be responsible!" May I ask how can such a non-Party professor be responsible? One sentence made him unable to hold his head up for more than a year.

    Hope to Understand the Situation in Depth
    Truly Resolve Existing Contradictions

    Hu Sidu also raised the issue of the role of Party member teachers in higher education institutions. He said that Communist Party members should play a leading role in all work positions, but the leading role of general Party member teachers in higher education is not good enough. Their professional level is not high, how can they play a backbone role in teaching work? He also pointed out that scientific research work in higher education institutions is stuck at the stage of shouting slogans, with more calls than actual work, which is related to too many meetings. Recently, the trade union of their school investigated the time spent by a professor who undertakes social work and other situations: social activities account for one-fourth, teaching and scientific research work account for one-fourth, and various meetings and administrative work account for one-half. This proves that he spends three-quarters of his time "not doing his job," and only one-quarter of his time is spent on the work he should be doing. Hu Sidu suggested that higher education institutions should have "three meeting-free days."

    Hu Sidu also believes that the leadership of Tangshan Railway College has a vague understanding of the teachers' situation, and many problems cannot be solved because of this. The president (also the Party committee secretary) rarely goes to the departments and teaching and research groups to talk to the teachers, and rarely seeks the teachers' opinions. There is a lot of blindness in teaching work. He hopes that this time the school can rectify while going down to conduct arduous investigation and research work, to find out what problems exist in teaching work and what contradictions there are in the teachers' thinking. He said that since they owed this debt in the past, the sooner they pay it off, the better. He hopes that the Party committee secretary will do it himself, and not just rely on the comrades of the branch. The general comrades of the branch are mostly young people, lack experience, and cannot grasp the complexity of senior intellectuals, and have no practical experience in teaching work.

### 河北高等学校教授  针对教育领导工作提出批评

    河北高等学校教授
    针对教育领导工作提出批评
    本报讯　最近记者访问了河北一些高等学校的教授，征求他们对于高等教育部和学校领导的意见，谈谈教育工作中的矛盾。
    河北农学院教授刘旭初主张在高等学校恢复学分制和百分制。他说，高等学校几年来在教学制度上更改很多，副作用很大，主要是高等教育部有严重的教条主义。他们忽视中国教育过去的传统，生搬硬套一些制度和办法。当然，苏联先进经验是要学习的，也有些在教学上起了良好作用。问题在于学习的时候，不能不顾中国实际情况，硬来推行。譬如教学大纲，在苏联是五年学完，搬到中国来是四年毕业，这本身就是矛盾，形成学生负担过重。
    譬如学生成绩的记分，过去多是百分制，解放以来改了五分制。这在苏联是合适的，在中国就不合适。
    又如中国大学过去多是学分制，学分学完就毕业。这样，优秀学生可以提早毕业，迟钝的学生可以延长学习时间，这适应学生智力不同的情况，同时要求学生达到一定的毕业水平。解放以来废除了学分制，学生不管资质高低一起毕业，甚至明明不合格的也勉强送出门去，形成质量不齐。
    当然，百分制和学分制都是资本主义国家的制度，但移植到中国数十年，已适合中国国情。刘旭初教授特别谈到在以前他是不敢这样说的，怕被扣上“资产阶级思想”的帽子。
    老年教师有了进步
  领导上还用旧眼光看人
    唐山铁道学院讲师胡思杜谈到高等学校领导中的主观主义和宗派主义。他说，三反以前，一些年长教师的资产阶级思想肯定是十分严重的，三反中矛盾暴露了，几年来经过许多政治运动，许多老教师的思想是进步了，而学校领导还是以老眼光看人。学校中盛行青年教师路线，而对有经验的教师疏远，脱离了基本群众。而这些青年教师经验不足，却担负教学改革的重责，后果实在可怕。曾经有一位机械系的教师根据部里发下的苏联教学大纲压缩修改了，交给管教务的青年同志说，这已超过学生负荷能力六分之一，希望他到部里去力争缩减。结果这位青年同志不知教学甘苦，到部里开会的结果，不仅没有减少六分之一，倒增加了8％，以致从1953年到现在年年精简课程，多少学生闹病。
    河北农学院讲师陶学郁认为他们学校也有这种现象。教研组不管什么事，老教师总先要征求青年同志意见。什么运动都是他们担任组长，这使这些青年同志滋长骄傲自满情绪，认为老教师一无可取，而使老教师更感自卑，造成新老教师之间关系的不正常。
    这事实上是一种宗派主义的反映，因为这些青年同志多半是党、团员。胡思杜还谈到唐山铁道学院四个院长、副院长都是党员，而且都是铁道部派来的党员。教师们曾提出一个教授当院长，提了两年未批准。胡思杜认为铁道部领导不了解知识分子的脾气。他们希望有一个教授当院长，就如少数民族有他们自己人当自治区主席一样。另外，在唐山铁道学院中有一个非党教务长与院长发生争论，党员院长就声色俱厉地说：“你坚持，你得负责！”请问这样一位非党教授如何负责？一句话害得他一年多抬不起头来。
    希望深入了解情况
    确实解决现存矛盾
    胡思杜还提出党员教师在高等学校中的作用问题。他说共产党员在一切工作岗位上要起带头作用，而高等学校一般党员教师在业务中的带头作用是不够好的。他们业务水平不高，怎么在教学工作中起得了骨干作用。他又指出科学研究工作在高等学校停于呼口号阶段，号召多，做得少，这与会议过多有关。最近他们学校工会调查了一位担负社会工作等情况的教授的时间：社会活动占四分之一，教学、科学研究工作占四分之一，各种会议及行政工作占二分之一。这证明他有四分之三的时间“不务正业”，只有四分之一时间放在他应有的工作上面。胡思杜建议高等学校应有 “三天无会日”。
    胡思杜还认为唐山铁道学院领导上对教师的情况若明若暗，了解不清楚，因之许多问题解决不了。院长（兼党委书记）很少下到系里和教研组和教师谈谈心，也很少征求教师的意见，教学工作盲目性很大。他希望这次学校中能边整风，边下去，作艰苦的调查研究工作，摸摸教学工作究竟存在什么问题，教师思想有什么矛盾。他说过去既然欠了这笔账，愈早还愈好。他希望党委书记亲自动手，不要仅仅依赖支部同志搞。一般支部同志多是年轻人，经验少，对高级知识分子的复杂性掌握不了，在教学工作上又无实际体会。
