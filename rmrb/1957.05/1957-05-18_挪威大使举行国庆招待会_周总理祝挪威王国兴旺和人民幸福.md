Xinhua News Agency, May 17th. Premier Zhou Enlai, at the National Day reception held by Norwegian Ambassador Mr. Klogh-Hanssen this afternoon, raised his glass to wish prosperity to the Kingdom of Norway and happiness to the Norwegian people.

    The reception was held in a garden full of flowers and trees. When Premier Zhou Enlai delivered his speech in the decorated pavilion, he also proposed a toast to the health of His Majesty King Haakon VII of Norway.

    Afterwards, Premier Zhou went among the Chinese and foreign guests to shake hands and converse with them. Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, also chatted with the heads of diplomatic missions.

    Li Xiufu, Commercial Attaché of the Norwegian Embassy, expressed to Premier Zhou his hope for the development of trade between the two countries. Premier Zhou Enlai introduced him to Lu Xuzhang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade. The Premier said that trade between our two countries will certainly develop, although our people are still very poor and our culture is still backward, it will take some time for economic prosperity and cultural development, but the general trend of trade between our two countries is forward.

    Ambassador Klogh-Hanssen introduced Mrs. Schiøtt, the reporter from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation responsible for Far East coverage, to the Premier. Mrs. Schiøtt spoke fluent Chinese. She told Premier Zhou that she was born in Yiyang, Hunan Province, China, lived in China for fifteen years, and returned to Norway in 1924. Coming to China again this time, she felt an indescribable sense of warmth, and she hoped to stay in China for a few more days. The Premier welcomed her.

    The Chargé d'affaires of the Netherlands, Mr. Sman, and his wife are leaving Beijing tomorrow to return home. At today's reception, they bid farewell to Premier Zhou. They told Premier Zhou that they would take many Chinese local products, records, and handicrafts back home. They said, "Many people will like the Chinese gifts we bring back."

    Premier Zhou Enlai talked with Swiss Ambassador Mr. Béguin about the issue of foreign envoys visiting various parts of China. He said that it was originally planned to invite the envoys to travel and visit various places recently, but because Chairman Voroshilov will soon return to Beijing, and the National People's Congress is expected to be held in early June, the ambassadors' visits will have to take place after the National People's Congress. Premier Zhou then smiled and said to the ambassador, "Staying in Beijing all the time, the city walls will surround us. It seems that there are too few gates in the Beijing city walls, and more gates need to be opened."

    挪威大使举行国庆招待会
    周总理祝挪威王国兴旺和人民幸福
    新华社17日讯　周恩来总理今天下午在挪威大使克洛格—亨生举行的国庆招待会上，举杯祝挪威王国的兴旺和人民幸福。
    招待会是在一座花木繁茂的花园内举行的。周恩来总理站在彩饰的凉亭里致词的时候，还提议为挪威国王哈康七世陛下的健康干杯。
    接着，周总理就走到中外人士中间同他们握手，并同他们交谈。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真，国务院副总理聂荣臻，政协全国委员会副主席章伯钧，外交部副部长章汉夫等也同各国使节在一起谈心。
    挪威大使馆商务专员李秀夫向周总理表示了希望发展两国贸易的愿望，周恩来总理介绍他同对外贸易部副部长卢绪章会见。总理说，我们两国的贸易一定会得到发展，尽管我国人民还很贫困，文化还很落后，要使经济繁荣和文化发达还需要一个时间，但是，我们两国贸易的总趋势是向前发展的。
    克洛格—亨生大使介绍挪威广播公司负责远东方面报道的记者修迪夫人同总理认识。修迪夫人汉话讲得很流利。她告诉周总理，她出生在中国湖南省的益阳，在中国住了十五年，1924年回到挪威的。这次再到中国来，怀着一种说不出的亲切的感情，她希望能在中国多留几天，总理表示欢迎。
    荷兰代办司曼和夫人明天就要离开北京回国，在今天的招待会上他们向周总理辞行。他们告诉周总理，他们将带许多中国的土特产、唱片、手工艺品回国。他们说：“许多人都会喜欢我们所带回去的中国礼物。”
    周总理同瑞士大使贝努义谈到了各国使节到中国各地参观的问题。他说，原来准备邀请使节们在最近到各地旅行参观，但因为伏罗希洛夫主席不久就要回北京，全国人民代表大会会议预计也将在6月初召开，所以大使们参观的事情要在人民代表大会开过以后才行。周总理又笑着对大使说：“老呆在北京，城墙就把我们围住了，看来，北京城墙的门太少了，需要多开几个门。”
