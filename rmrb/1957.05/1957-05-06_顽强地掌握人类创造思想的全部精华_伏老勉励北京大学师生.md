Dear teachers and professors!
Dear students!

Your warm reception has deeply moved us. In this reception, we see the sincerest brotherly friendship of Chinese intellectuals, youth, and all the Chinese people towards our people. Today, we have come to your excellent university to take this opportunity to extend, in our own name and on behalf of all Soviet people, brotherly greetings to you and, through you, to all intellectuals and youth of great China. The Soviet people harbor the purest and deepest friendship for the Chinese people.

We have spent twenty days in your beautiful and prosperous country. During this time, we have visited many cities, factories, and institutions, and have met with people from all walks of life in China, including workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, intellectuals, and youth, and have seen the great achievements made by the free Chinese people under the leadership of their wise Communist Party.

In all the outstanding socialist transformations, Chinese intellectuals—scientists, engineers, and other experts—are playing a tremendous role.

The great Lenin said after the victory of our October Socialist Revolution that now all technical miracles and all cultural achievements would become the wealth of the entire people, and that from now on, the wisdom and genius of people would no longer become tools of oppression or means of exploitation. To realize Lenin's legacy, intellectuals in socialist countries are working selflessly.

The Communist Party of China has turned the achievements of culture and the achievements of human wisdom into the property of the entire people. The People's Republic of China has, in a short period of time, established a system for training cadres—engineers, agronomists, teachers, doctors, and other specialists. In just seven years after the establishment of the people's government, China has opened dozens of universities and hundreds of secondary technical schools, which have opened their doors to the outstanding sons and daughters of the working people. Young men and women constantly grasp revolutionary Marxist-Leninist theory and modern scientific and technological knowledge, broaden their socio-political horizons, and prepare to become, and will inevitably become, true builders of socialist society and inheritors of the Communist Party's glorious revolutionary principles.

During our visit to China, we have seen with our own eyes that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the outstanding activist Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms, have embarked on the broad road of technological, scientific, and cultural progress in the cultural revolution. We Soviet people are happy for these achievements of our Chinese brothers, because we ourselves have experienced this difficult, but glorious road of socialist cultural construction.

The Soviet people are studying the long-standing culture of the fraternal Chinese people with great interest. The outstanding representatives of Russia have always valued and carefully studied the rich treasure house of Chinese culture.

Dear young friends! The Communist Party and the people place great hopes on you. Naturally, we believe that you will tenaciously grasp all the essence created by human creative thought. After you leave the gates of the university, you will be high-level experts and builders of a new society.

We believe that you will gloriously repay the trust and hope of the Communist Party and all the Chinese people.

Dear professors and teachers!

We sincerely congratulate you on your achievements in training glorious Chinese youth to actively and creatively participate in the construction of a new socialist society. We wish you great achievements in the development of science that serves the people and is of great significance for building socialism and improving the material and cultural level of the people.

We tell you that the Soviet intellectuals, all Soviet youth students, and all the Soviet people will always be with Chinese friends, advancing side by side along the path pointed out by the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine in our common struggle to achieve the happiness of mankind.

Students and teachers, we wish you outstanding achievements in labor and mastering knowledge, and in teaching and scientific research work.

May China's science and culture continue to develop and prosper under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!
Long live the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism!

    顽强地掌握人类创造思想的全部精华
    ·伏老勉励北京大学师生·
    亲爱的教师和教授同志们！
    亲爱的学生同志们！
    您们热情的接待深深地激动了我们，我们在这种接待中看到了中国知识分子、青年和全体中国人民对我国人民最真挚的兄弟友谊。今天我们到你们这所出色的大学里来，是想趁此机会以我们自己的名义，以及代表全体苏联人向你们、并且通过你们向伟大中国所有的知识分子和青年致兄弟的敬礼，苏联人民对中国人民怀着最纯挚、最深厚的友情。
    我们在你们美好繁荣的国家里已经度过了二十天。在这段时间里我们访问了许多城市、工厂、机关，多次会见了各阶层的中国人民，有工人，也有农业合作社社员、知识分子和青年，并且看到了自由的中国人民在自己英明的共产党领导下取得了何等巨大的成就。
    在各项卓越的社会主义改造中，中国的知识分子——科学家、工程师以及其他专家起着巨大的作用。
    伟大的列宁在我国十月社会主义革命胜利之后说过，现在一切技术奇迹、全部文化成果都将成为全民的财富，从今以后人们的智慧、天才再不会成为压迫的工具、剥削的手段了。为了实现列宁这个遗训，社会主义阵营国家的知识分子都在忘我地劳动着。
    中国共产党使文化的成果、人类智慧的成就变成了全民的财产。中华人民共和国在短短的时期内建立了培养干部——工程师，农艺师，教师，医生和其他的专家的系统。仅仅在人民政权建立后的七年之内，中国就开办了几十所高等学校和几百所中等技术学校，这些学校向劳动人民的优秀儿女敞开了大门。青年男女们不断掌握革命的马克思列宁主义理论和现代科学技术知识，扩大了自己的社会政治眼界，准备成为、而且必然会成为名副其实的社会主义社会的建设者，成为共产党光辉的革命原则的继承人。
    我们在访问中国期间亲眼看到，中国人民在以杰出的活动家——毛泽东同志和他的战友为首的中国共产党的领导下进行的文化革命中，踏上了技术、科学和文化进步的康庄大道。我们苏联人为我们的中国兄弟的这些成就而感到高兴，因为我们自己也经历过这条艰巨的、然而是光荣的社会主义文化建设的道路。
    苏联人在以极大的兴趣研究兄弟中国人民的悠久文化。俄国的优秀代表人物一向重视、并且仔细深入地研究过中国文化的丰富宝库。
    亲爱的年青朋友们！共产党和人民对你们寄予很大的希望，自然，我们相信，你们会顽强地掌握人类的创造思想所造成的全部精华，你们走出高等学校之门以后就是具有高度水平的专家，新社会的建设者。
    我们相信，你们将光荣地报答共产党和全体中国人民的信任和希望。
    亲爱的教授和教师同志们！
    我们衷心祝贺你们在培养光荣的中国青年去积极和有创造性地参加社会主义新社会建设的工作中获得成就，祝你们在发展为人民服务的，对建设社会主义、对提高人民物质和文化水平具有重大意义的科学方面获得巨大的成就。
    我们告诉你们，苏联的知识分子、全体苏联青年学生以及全体苏联人民将永远跟中国朋友们一起，在我们为实现人类的幸福的共同斗争中沿着伟大的马克思列宁主义学说所指出的道路并肩前进。
    学生和教师同志们，祝你们在劳动和掌握知识方面、在教学和科学研究工作方面获得卓越的成就。
    祝中国的科学和文化在光荣的中国共产党领导下不断发展，不断繁荣！
    苏中两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说万岁！
