Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: Amman Dispatch: The Jordanian government ordered the dissolution of Jordanian labor unions and employee associations on May 1st. The work of purging "left-leaning personnel" from lower-level government agencies has also begun.

The government continues to arrest patriots. Sources say that a member of parliament elected in Ramallah and the principal of a teachers' college in Ramallah were recently arrested, and the school has also been closed.

According to Reuters, Jordanian security personnel closed the Cairo-based Middle East News Agency's offices in Amman and Jerusalem on April 30 and arrested the Middle East News Agency's chief correspondent in Jerusalem.

On April 30, an official Jordanian spokesman commented on the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the Jordanian issue, insisting that the statement did not apply to the current situation. In its statement on April 29, the Soviet Foreign Ministry pointed out that the Jordanian events and the resulting aggravation of the situation in the Near and Middle East were a practical manifestation of the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine."

According to a UPI reporter, some Jordanian officials believe that U.S. Army Secretary Brucker's remarks on April 29 were the most unfortunate thing to happen at this critical moment. Brucker had said that U.S. troops were prepared to enter Jordan if necessary.

On May 1, King Hussein of Jordan received in succession army officers loyal to the royal family, Bedouin tribal leaders, hundreds of political and religious figures, and foreign ambassadors to Jordan. The first diplomat to visit the King was U.S. Ambassador Mallory, accompanied by U.S. Army Attaché Colonel Sweeney, who was accused by former Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Nawar and others of interfering in Jordan's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: Washington Dispatch: U.S. State Department officials said on May 1 that some of King Hussein of Jordan's current approaches to handling the situation in Jordan are consistent with the substance of the Eisenhower Doctrine, although he feels he cannot accept "the form," especially inviting U.S. President's Special Envoy Richards to visit Amman.

Officials said: "Hussein has tried his best to eliminate communist propaganda in his country, has imprisoned overt communists, and has refused to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union as planned by the former Nabulsi government." They said that these are the goals of the Eisenhower Doctrine, and according to the situation, these are also Hussein's goals.

The above remarks by State Department officials are considered a response to the repeated statements by Jordanian officials that they are not prepared to invite Richards to visit Amman. These people said that Hussein cannot do so "due to the indignation of Jordanian public opinion, which is highly nationalistic and strongly opposes any action that appears to link Jordan too closely with the United States."

    约旦政府继续迫害进步力量
    美官员说侯赛因政策符合艾森豪威尔主义
    据新华社2日讯  安曼消息：约旦政府在5月1日下令解散约旦的工会和雇员协会。在政府的下级机构中清除“左倾人员”的工作也已经开始。
    政府继续逮捕爱国人士。有消息说，一个在拉马拉选出的议员和拉马拉一所师范学校的校长最近被逮捕，这所学校也已经被封闭。
    据路透社消息说，约旦公安人员在4月30日封闭了埃及中东通讯社在安曼和耶路撒冷的办事处，并且逮捕了中东通讯社驻耶路撒冷的首席记者。
    约旦官方发言人在4月30日评论苏联外交部发表的关于约旦问题的声明时，硬说这个声明不适用于目前局势。苏联外交部在4月29日发表的声明中指出，约旦事件和由此引起的中近东局势的尖锐化是“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的实际表现。
    据合众社记者报道，某些约旦官员认为，美国陆军部长布鲁克4月29日的谈话是在这个危急的时刻发生的最不幸的事情。布鲁克曾经说，美国军队准备在必要时进入约旦。
    约旦国王侯赛因在5月1日先后接见了忠于王室的陆军军官、贝都印族首脑、几百个政界和宗教人士以及外国驻约旦使节。第一个访问国王的外交官是美国大使马洛里，他由被约旦前陆军参谋长诺瓦尔等指责为干涉约旦内政的美国陆军武官史维尼上校陪同前往。
    新华社2日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务院官员1日说，约旦国王侯赛因目前处理约旦局势的一些做法同艾森豪威尔主义的实质是一致的，虽然他觉得不能接受“这个形式”，尤其不能邀请美国总统特使理查兹访问安曼。
    官员们说：“侯赛因已经尽量取消了共产党在他国家里的宣传，已经把公开的共产党人关进监狱，并且拒绝如前纳布西首相的政府所计划的那样与苏联建立外交关系。”他们说，艾森豪威尔主义的目的就是这些，而根据情况看来，这也是侯赛因的目的。
    国务院官员的上述谈话被认为是对于约旦官方一再声明不准备邀请理查兹访问安曼的反应。这些人士说，侯赛因不能这样做是“由于约旦舆论的愤慨情绪，约旦舆论是高度民族主义的，并且强烈地反对看来要把约旦同美国联系得太密切的任何行动”。
