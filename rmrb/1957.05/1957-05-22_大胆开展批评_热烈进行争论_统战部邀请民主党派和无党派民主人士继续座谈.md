(Our Dispatch) The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited responsible persons from the central committees of various democratic parties and non-party democrats to a symposium. After a four-day recess, the eighth meeting was held on the afternoon of the 21st. Speakers at this meeting included Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League; Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League; Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Lin Handa; Li Dequan, a non-party democrat; and Li Yi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jiusan Society. Fan Yaofeng, a Central Committee member of the China National Democratic Construction Association who had just arrived in Beijing from Zhejiang for the meeting, delivered a written statement at today's symposium. Zhang Bojun said:

    Now there are design institutes for industry, but there is no design institute for politics.

    "The Communist Party's democratic spirit has achieved great results."

Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said that today he would like to talk about his personal opinions: First, in the past twenty-odd days, people all over the country have been discussing internal contradictions among the people, helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style, and putting forward many opinions, which seems to be very normal. The Communist Party's leadership, the Communist Party's policies, the Communist Party's spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and its democratic spirit have achieved great results. This is a new thing in Chinese political history and the history of the socialist movement. The fraternal countries attach great importance to it. The imperialist countries want to find our faults, but they can't. For example, the issue of the Party committee leadership system in schools, which has been raised in the past two weeks, has aroused a lot of discussion. As far as the friends I have contacted are concerned, everyone's views are basically similar, and they all believe that the leadership of the Communist Party is indispensable, and the Party can lead science politically. However, on the other hand, everyone also feels that this system has shortcomings and has led to the shortcomings of sectarianism, dogmatism, and bureaucracy. Therefore, everyone believes that more opinions from professors and students should be listened to. This proves that "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" does not affect the leadership of the Communist Party, but enhances the prestige of the Communist Party.

Now, further demands should be put forward. Recently, I attended some symposiums in Beijing and felt that some people still did not finish their words. At a symposium of senior technicians, someone asked me what I thought after speaking. There may be more concerns below. Therefore, in the future, we should thoroughly broaden the channels of speech. Now, the opinions of only the middle and upper-level figures can reflect many aspects of the situation, but it should also be popularized to the lower levels. The lower-level cadres have made great contributions to the country in the past few years, and their contributions are not small, but they have made many mistakes. Therefore, I hope that this rectification can listen to the opinions of the grassroots people.

    "It is impossible to achieve the expected goals if the Party makes a decision and goes ahead with it."

Secondly, let’s talk about a few issues: In the past few years, especially since the CPPCC meeting last year, the state leadership has attached great importance to the opinions of all parties, and democratic life has become increasingly rich. In the future, we can listen to the opinions of all parties on major national policies and guidelines. For example, this rectification, combined with checking and improving work, is of course good. In the past, many vigorous good deeds were done, but some things also brought losses to the country. If, at the beginning of the work, we listened more to the opinions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the CPPCC, and the democratic parties, we could avoid detours. For example, in the anti-illiteracy campaign, the five-year consistent system, and the promotion of double-wheeled, double-shared plows, if the ministers of the State Council, based on the materials, discussed them in many ways, or discussed them by the democratic parties, senior intellectuals, and experts, the losses would be reduced. If the Party makes a decision and goes ahead with it, it is impossible to achieve the expected goals. Another example is the system issue, the issue of decentralization between the central and local governments. Last year, it was only given to the local Party committee secretaries and a few senior non-Party cadres for discussion. It was mainly discussed within the Party. We should use the CPPCC, the various committees of the National People's Congress, and the democratic parties to discuss it. These people have considerable understanding and experience. Another example is language reform. I think it is neither a national defense secret nor a class struggle issue. It is a contradiction among the people, but only a few enthusiastic people have discussed it. In this way, is everyone getting through it? I think there is a big problem, quite a confusion, including some comrades within the Party. If language reform is equal to socialism and communism, I have no objection, I cannot oppose it; if it is a cultural issue, it should be discussed within and outside the Party, and should be discussed more from academic, political, and rational perspectives.

I partially agree with Chen Mengjia's opinion in the Wenhui Daily.

    "The CPPCC, the National People's Congress, the democratic parties, and the people's organizations should be political design institutes."

Now there are many design institutes in the industrial field, but many facilities in the political field do not have a design institute. I think the CPPCC, the National People's Congress, the democratic parties, and the people's organizations should be four political design institutes. We should give more play to the role of these design institutes. Some political basic construction should be handed over to them for discussion in advance. Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. Now the universities are very dissatisfied with the Party committee system, and a wide-ranging discussion should be launched. The system can be supplemented because everyone is taking the socialist road. Doing so will enrich the content of democratic life.

The CPPCC and the National People's Congress should not wait until the expiration date. This year, we can discuss the major events to be done next year. We cannot rely entirely on the inspection system. We must have regular discussions on what the country is preparing to do.

Recently, CPPCC members have gone to work below to inspect the work, and the work has increased. But we cannot stop at inspecting the work. We must further allow everyone to regularly discuss major national issues.

    "State Council meetings often come up with finished products. This kind of formalistic meeting can be held less often."

Most professors reflect that there are many meetings, which depends on what kind of meeting. If it is a uniform report meeting, a formalistic meeting, it is best to hold less of it. For example, State Council meetings often come up with finished products and ask us to express our opinions. This kind of formalistic meeting can be held less often. But if we can raise questions, put forward materials for serious discussion, have rich content, and give play to everyone's opinions, everyone will not feel that there are many meetings. Regarding the system issue, how to do it, everyone can discuss it deeply, and the language reform issue can also be discussed by everyone.

In the CPPCC and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Central Committee of the Communist Party should consider placing a group of capable Communist Party members. Many leading comrades of the Communist Party have knowledge and energy. Can a part of them be assigned to participate in the above-mentioned institutions under the principle of unified arrangement, and exchange opinions with people from all walks of life regularly, instead of just looking at what you are saying like some Communist Party comrades do now? In the future, when the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the CPPCC discuss issues, the standing ministers of each department should attend to represent the departments and explain the policies. This is not parliamentary politics in capitalist countries.

In the past year or two, the government has made arrangements for elderly intellectuals, which has achieved great results. However, there are still some social intellectuals with less reputation whose thinking has undergone great changes and who have difficulties in life. The government should have appropriate policies to gradually solve their problems.

The remaining issues in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and the "Supress hidden Counterrevolutionaries" campaign have been discussed repeatedly. The Party and the government should be determined to check them. The inspection should be prepared and done well.

The united front policy of the Chinese Communist Party played a huge role in the revolution. The experience in this area should be summarized. It is necessary to find theoretical basis from Marx and Lenin to educate Communist Party members; but it is better to make a summary from the actual life, from the cooperation between Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Communist Party until now on the united front work. It will have a greater educational effect on party members. When making a summary of a certain department, relevant democratic parties can also be invited to participate, which can also reduce a little bit of subjectivism.

    A debate among Shao Lizi, Luo Longji, and Zhang Bojun

    Shao Lizi said: Language reform has been discussed in the National Committee of the CPPCC two or three times, and it has also been handed over to local CPPCCs for discussion. It was not done behind closed doors by a few people.

Shao Lizi said, I don't want to argue with Mr. Zhang Bojun. Of course, in the period of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, debate is also possible. However, my intention is not here. I just want to explain a situation to waste less time in future discussions. I participated in the work of the Language Reform Committee. Mr. Bojun said that language reform was done behind closed doors by a few people, which is too wrong. In fact, every time a plan was put forward, the Language Reform Committee solicited opinions from all sectors of society, and people from the publishing and printing industries held many symposiums. The National Committee of the CPPCC also discussed it two or three times, and it was also handed over to the local CPPCCs for discussion. Mr. Bojun, as the vice chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, put forward such an opinion, which is quite serious. It is not good to say that the CPPCC did not discuss it. When soliciting opinions in the past, Mr. Bojun did not pay attention. He is a leading comrade and is very busy. When the CPPCC held a meeting to discuss, he either did not come, or did not pay attention to listening, or did not express his opinions after listening. There are shortcomings in the work of language reform, and of course it can be criticized, but the arrow must be aimed accurately, and it must be targeted, not randomly. It is a random arrow to say that the issue of language reform has not solicited the opinions of the masses.

Luo Longji continued, I am also a member of the China Democratic League. I am not engaging in sectarianism to defend Mr. Bojun, but I want to add some information. The issue of language reform has been discussed. At that time, the discussion was about the Pinyin scheme, not about whether Chinese characters should be Pinyin. When it comes to simplification of Chinese characters, there was no discussion about the direction of simplification of Chinese characters. What was brought out for discussion was simplified characters. Moreover, when it was brought out for discussion, it was said that the Party had already decided. In this way, if the discussion is launched, it will be said that it is opposing the Party's policy. At that time, many people did not dare to speak.

Zhang Bojun continued, Mr. Shao Lizi's criticism of me is correct. Some people used to say that I was the tail of the Communist Party, and followed everything. However, I doubt that Chinese characters will be changed to Pinyin. When the CPPCC discussed it, Chen Yi asked me to speak, but I did not speak. But everyone agreed to pass it, and I did not object. Now it is not a discussion from the legal procedure, but it is proposed as a fundamental issue for discussion.

Luo Longji said, Chairman Mao is in favor of Pinyinization, so it is difficult for everyone to express their opinions when discussing this.

Shao Lizi asked in reply, Since you have opinions, why didn't you speak at that time? It is too wrong to push everything to the Communist Party now.

Zhang Bojun replied, I said it today. Xu Guangping said:

    Leading Party and social figures do not pay attention to the China Association for Promoting Democracy

Xu Guangping, in her speech, first criticized the leading Party and social figures for not paying attention to the China Association for Promoting Democracy. She said that the CAPD is a small party and is also responsible for the work of primary and secondary school teachers. The two "small" added together naturally fail to arouse the attention of the leading Party and the general public. For example, once we wanted to hold a meeting and notified the United Front Work Department in advance to seek the help of the leading Party, but the answer we got was: a certain big party is going to hold a meeting and has no time to take care of you. In this way, we had to postpone it. She asked the Communist Party to treat large and small parties equally.

Because the members of the CAPD are primary and secondary school teachers, the local governments do not pay much attention to it, and even have doubts about what the CAPD is doing. The Guangming Daily also publishes the least amount of news about the CAPD. Therefore, we have encountered many difficulties in our work. For example, the housing problem is even more prominent in the CAPD. The CAPD headquarters and the Beijing branch are squeezed together, and there is not even a place to eat. The staffing is also not keeping up with the development of the situation, and the cadres are too busy to carry out their work well. The funds are also being reduced again and again. In fact, we have already used a narrow budget when making the budget, and after repeated cuts, we feel that even the necessary funds are difficult.

Then, she said, some people think that the CAPD is a small party and is relatively simple, and probably has no problems. In fact, the CAPD is a party of intellectuals, and it cannot be said that there are no problems. How democratic parties can give play to their creativity and independence is a problem. Of course, democratic parties need the leadership of the Communist Party, but if the things done by democratic parties are beneficial to the people and do not violate policies, they should give play to the creativity and independence of democratic parties. For example, in the past, when we, the CAPD, went to the grassroots to mobilize the masses to sign petitions for peace, we often encountered cadres saying: The Party has not arranged it yet, so let's do it later. So we had to put it away and not do it. I think that democratic parties should be allowed to do more of this kind of thing that does not violate policies.

Regarding the problem of "unity at the top but not at the bottom", Xu Guangping said that this phenomenon does exist. The grassroots units really do not understand the democratic parties and have not recognized their role. When our CAPD Wuhan branch was established, we hoped that the newspaper would send a reporter to participate. The newspaper staff said: What kind of meeting are you holding? We don't have time to participate. After repeated contacts, there was no result. Finally, our secretary-general went to the newspaper to find the person in charge, and then sent a reporter to participate. Another example is that when a school in Beijing held a Respect for the Elderly Meeting, the Party, the Youth League, the trade union, the administration, the student union, and the class representatives all spoke, and finally it was the CAPD's turn. Therefore, CAPD members have a sense of inferiority and are uncomfortable. Members do not want to compete for precedence, but also need to be properly arranged.

Xu Guangping also said that in the past few years, the Party has done a lot of work for senior intellectuals, but it has done very little for ordinary intellectuals. Not only do they have positions without power, but they also feel that their positions are inappropriate. The promotion of cadres in primary and secondary schools focuses on Party and Youth League members, and some are even all Party members. Some people who cannot teach are promoted to cadres. No matter how experienced the old teachers are, they cannot be promoted. Some teachers who do not perform well in teaching can be promoted immediately after being approved to join the Party. The general public does not respect primary and secondary school teachers enough. Most of the undisciplined students in a school in Beijing are children of senior cadres. When students have problems, these cadres blame the teachers. A student's parent in a school even grabbed a teacher's collar and rebuked him. A teacher in Shenyang was even handcuffed for this reason. Many young people are unwilling to be primary and secondary school teachers. More importantly, primary and secondary school teachers should be respected, trusted, and cultivated politically. Of course, they should be given certain material encouragement and living security, but not calculated on a cent-by-cent basis, and everything should be given money. Some places have marking fees for marking papers and observation teaching fees for observing teaching. This is a capitalist business management idea. Xu Guangping also talked about: Senior intellectuals require a guarantee of six-fifths of their time to engage in research work, while middle school teachers have no guarantee and no specific plan. Many primary and secondary school teachers have excessively heavy tasks, and female teachers have no time to manage housework. People who educate others cannot educate their own children. General teachers, especially Chinese language teachers, are very busy, which not only affects their health and teaching quality, but also does not have time to pay attention to the moral education of students, so that theft occurs in some schools. Lin Handa said:

    The entire Ministry of Education has a position but no power.

    The Ministry of Education sends a notice down, and it doesn't work. Even if the State Council is added, it still doesn't work. A joint instruction from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council is required.

Lin Handa said, I just came back from an inspection and will reflect the sentiments below. Now, senior intellectuals in Beijing, Shanghai and other places are "blooming and contending" very lively, but primary and secondary school teachers and literacy teachers dare not "bloom and contend". The main reason is that they have concerns. Someone reflected: I have old people above me and young people below me. Although I believe that I will not be retaliated against, I will always suffer losses. It is now the time for streamlining, and who knows if I will be streamlined out.

Teachers have no status in society and are not valued. This situation is very common. Some people say that primary school teachers seem to be inferior, and unexpectedly, there are even lower-level ones than primary school teachers, and adult education teachers are two levels lower. A literacy teacher does not dare to let his wife know that he is a literacy teacher, fearing that she will divorce him. This time I ran several factories in Shanghai and found that Party members and Youth League members do not pay attention to adult education. This can be seen from their learning situation. Some people reflect: "The masses are excellent students, the Youth League members are remedial students, and the Party members are repeat students." Why is this so? Is there a contradiction between adult education and production? No, it is mainly a problem of arrangement. The leadership does not pay attention to it, and the study time is not guaranteed.

The United Front Work Department is biased towards large parties and does not pay attention to small parties. Some people in the Communist Party still do not know what the CAPD does. If you test the United Front Work Policy of “long-term coexistence and mutual supervision,” I think the democratic parties will pass, but the Communist Party members may not pass.

The China Association for Promoting Democracy held a symposium of two provinces and one city in Shanghai, which lasted eight days and was very successful. However, only the Liberation Daily reported it, and Guangming Daily and other newspapers did not publish it. We dare not hope for the People's Daily at all. The China Democratic League held a three-day meeting, and all the newspapers went there. Large parties hold meetings for three days, and it is widely reported. Small parties are "blooming and contending," but no one cares.

Regarding the issue of having a position and power, Lin Handa said, I am not saying that I personally have a position without power, but that the entire Ministry of Education has a position without power. The Ministry of Education does not know about many things. The Ministry of Education sends a notice down, and it doesn't work. Even if the State Council is added, it still doesn't work. A joint instruction from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council is required. What is the use of government departments? If you affirm that you have achievements, then you have achievements. If you say there are deviations, then there are deviations. For example, in 1952, Qi Jianhua was praised to the sky, like Cangjie the second and Confucius the second. The next year, he was defeated and everything was negated.

The literacy work was done better in 1954-1955, and there was adventurism in 1956. Adventurism is mainly reflected in the planning. The tasks that were supposed to be completed in seven years were said to be completed in three or five years, which is actually just empty talk. When the spring plowing came, the literacy work was already declining, and the People's Daily published an editorial to correct blind adventurism. Where did the People's Daily editorial come from? The Minister of Education does not know. Who can command the Ministry of Education? It is said that 9 million people were eliminated from illiteracy in 1956. In fact, this is the result of 1954-1955. The results of 1956 will not be seen until 1958.

Lin Handa talked about here, and Ma Yin-chu interjected and said: The People's Daily will not publish anything without evidence.

Then Lin Handa talked about the textbooks and teaching materials for adult education. He said that adult education for workers and peasants requires guaranteeing six or eight hours per week. It is obviously impossible to use textbooks from regular schools. People with educational common sense would not do this. I did not know about this decision in advance, but I have to make a review because I am responsible for adult education, so I have to review bureaucratism. Textbooks and reference books are all problems. Why? Because the fate is in the hands of the Xinhua Bookstore. The Xinhua Bookstore only supplies primary and secondary schools, not adult schools. They give as much as they give, and they don't give as much as they don't give. If there was not only one Xinhua Bookstore, but also a "Huaxin Bookstore," it would be better.

The cultural and educational assistants in the districts, people say that they are "文教不理" [wén jiào bù lǐ] (literally, “culture and education unmanaging”), and the education section is an "不务正业科" [bù wù zhèng yè kē] (literally, “a department that doesn't attend to its proper duties”), because the local leading cadres do not pay attention to the cultural and educational work. There are also phenomena of discrimination and insult against adult education teachers locally. Someone said, "Instead of giving food to adult education teachers, I would rather give it to dogs." Someone in Shanghai reported that adult education teachers are "三不管工作人员" [sān bù guǎn gōng zuò rényuán] ("three-no-management personnel," meaning they are not taken care of by anyone). This is the result of not paying attention to adult education from the central government, including the Ministry of Education, to the local governments. However, adult schools bear a very heavy responsibility. There are 890,000 adult school students in Shanghai alone. We not only call for primary and secondary school teachers, but also for adult education teachers. Now the newspapers in Shanghai are already speaking for adult education teachers, but Beijing is not yet. If this situation of not paying attention to adult education is not changed, it will have a great impact on the socialist cause. Li Dequan said:

    Health work is related to everyone. I hope all parties will help solve the existing problems.

Li Dequan said that health work is related to 600 million people and even those who have not yet been born in the womb. It is inevitable that everyone will have opinions on the shortcomings in this area. On the other hand, the Ministry of Health also has three isms. In terms of living welfare and the use of cadres, there are shortcomings of sectarianism; public medical care is subjectivism. It was developed on the basis of the supply system. At that time, we did not measure human and material resources, nor did we consider that some people still have non-socialist ideological consciousness and do not cherish state property. Therefore, implementing this system too early would bring losses to the country and generate waste. At the same time, this is also a system that exceeds socialism. It is said that staff in the Soviet Union still have to pay for their own medicine when they see a doctor. He said that this mistake is first of all a mistake of the health department. Then Li Dequan criticized dogmatism and bureaucracy in health work. He said: The dogmatism in health work is manifested in the fact that some good things in the Soviet Union are not necessarily practical for us, but we also rigidly move them and learn them. Bureaucratism is manifested in the fact that we do not have enough contact with senior intellectuals. In our work, we did not consult them more and often made decisions from a subjective point of view. For example, the organization and system of hospitals should be discussed with people who run hospitals; running medical education should be discussed with medical education experts, but what we have done in the past is not enough. From the perspective of our ministry, some cadres below reflect that the minister does not have enough contact with them. From this point of view, I think that the Party's proposal to solve the problem of internal contradictions among the people is timely. Everyone has raised the problem, and also has the desire to improve. But whether all can be solved depends on the objective conditions.

Based on the above points, she hopes that all parties will help the Ministry of Health: First, solve the problems in the public medical system. Second, can the length of study in medical schools be changed to six years? Please also consider it. Third, how to arrange the study of traditional Chinese medicine appropriately? Now because our arrangements are not appropriate enough. Some Chinese medicine practitioners say that they are just a beautiful paper flower.

Finally, she raised two questions. She said that women in capitalist countries are educated but have few opportunities to participate in political activities. Our situation is completely different, but there are still problems. Some people have such an idea about those female cadres who have contributed their strength in the revolution but do not have time to improve their cultural literacy: You should go home. She hopes to give these female comrades an opportunity to improve their culture so that they can work well.

Regarding the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, she said that the Soviet Union helped us during the War of Resistance Against Japan, which I saw with my own eyes. After liberation, the Soviet Union's help was even greater. From the perspective of health work alone, in 1947, the plague broke out in the Northeast. How many people were ill! When people mentioned the plague, they turned pale and did not recognize their relatives. In the early days of liberation, the plague broke out in the Chahar and Inner Mongolia regions. Fearing that it would spread, railway traffic was cut off. At that time, at the request of our government, the Soviet Union immediately sent an expert team, and the plague was eradicated within two weeks. This shows that the Soviet Union has always been helping us, and there are many things in the Soviet Union that are worth learning. It is correct for us to learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union obviously also has some shortcomings in its progress, but the direction is correct. We cannot get rid of him all at once because some things we used to move and use were inappropriate. Speaking here, Li Dequan said more clearly: We should have a correct understanding of learning from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is our good friend and we should learn from him, but when learning, we should conform to our objective situation and not treat one leg as a tree. Fan Yaofeng's written statement criticized the United Front Work Department:

    "Unity at the top but not at the bottom, unity with the old but not with the young, unity with the new but not with the old, unity with men but not with women"

I came to Beijing from Zhejiang for a meeting. Seeing the political atmosphere in Beijing, it is truly a scene of bright spring and a hundred flowers blooming. I see that a high tide of socialist democracy has appeared. After working at the grassroots level for two years, once I arrived in Beijing, I felt that the sun in Beijing was much warmer than below. Therefore, I am willing to participate in the symposium in writing on my own initiative as a member of the Central Committee of a democratic party to fulfill my responsibility without considering my ignorance. I put forward three suggestions:

1.  The Central United Front Work Department should look down more. Everyone knows how important the united front work is. Everyone has said that the United Front Work Department used to have the shortcomings of "unity at the top but not in the middle" and "unity at the top but not at the bottom." I want to add three more, and there are also the problems of "unity with the old but not with the young," "unity with the new but not with the old," and "unity with men but not with women." This is the reflection of the general public. I suggest that in the future, we should comprehensively unite the upper, middle, lower, old, young, new, old, men, and women. Because the middle and lower levels are the broadest and have the greatest potential, middle-aged and young people are the years to be promising, and old comrades have deep relationships. It will not be strange if they are not united. Uniting everything will be of great benefit to the work. At present, the general public does have such a feeling: "The seventh-rank official in front of the Prime Minister's mansion," "The Hou family is as deep as the sea," and it is really not easy to see the leading comrades. I think there are two reasons: one is the leadership itself, and the other is the walls created by the atmosphere below. For example, I have been in Zhejiang for two years, and I have not formally met the provincial leading comrades (only seen remotely at reports and meetings). I suggest that the leading comrades of the Central United Front Work Department visit the grassroots level more and convene such symposiums.

    A comrade made an analogy, saying that Party members treat non-Party members "like a bird, pinching it in their hands, fearing to pinch it to death if they pinch it too hard, and fearing to fly away if they relax."

2.  Let democratic party members take on more responsibility in various tasks as much as possible. My view is that democratic people generally have "positions," and the problem lies in the words "position" and "power." The situation is very complicated, and the root of the problem lies in the unity of "position, responsibility, and power." The key to this is to let them take on responsibility in their work like Party members. If they take on responsibility, how can they have no power? The current problem is that some Party organizations and Party members are not willing to let non-Party members take on more responsibility, as if only Party members can be responsible for doing things, and non-Party members cannot take on responsibility. A comrade made an analogy, as if treating us like a bird, pinching it in their hands, fearing to pinch it to death if they pinch it too hard, and fearing to fly away if they relax. Without responsibility, there will be no power. Therefore, in order to build socialism, I advocate letting people who can take on as much responsibility do as much as they can, and people who can take on as much responsibility exercise as much power. This is the personnel system of a socialist society.

3.  The handling of internal contradictions in democratic parties must rely on mobilizing the masses. There are many internal contradictions in democratic parties, and they are very complicated. The handling of internal contradictions in democratic parties plays a great role in the handling of internal contradictions among the people. For example, Comrade Zhang Naiqi mentioned the internal contradictions of the China National Democratic Construction Association, which is even more complicated. When I passed through Shanghai this time, I heard several members of the Central Committee say that the entire work of the Shanghai China National Democratic Construction Association can be represented by the two words "蹋班" [tà bān]: (meaning that everything lags behind the objective situation and requirements). Shanghai is the focus of the work of the China National Democratic Construction Association. Why is everything "蹋班"? I think the internal contradictions have not yet attracted enough attention. Only by relying on the masses can we correctly handle internal contradictions. I hope that the United Front Work Department will help the China National Democratic Construction Association handle internal contradictions, which will be of great help to the China National Democratic Construction Association in assisting the Party and the government in handling internal contradictions among the people.

    Li Yi has opinions on the speeches of Zhang Naiqi and Huang Shaohong.

    He said: The wall is built by both sides, and both sides need to take the initiative to push it down.

    He also said: Emphasizing achievements makes people proud, but emphasizing shortcomings will also make people lose their way.

    Li Yi reflected that many people are worried about carrying out criticism.

    He believes that measures should be formulated to prohibit retaliation.

Li Yi said: Now, non-Party members are helping the Party to rectify its work style and have put forward many opinions. The high tide of "blooming and contending" is forming. Some people have doubts, but I think it is very healthy. It is not too bad, it is very good. It is not letting it go too much, but it is not letting it go enough. Some people say: At present, it is only a level four or five wind. Why? He said: Although the thunder is rumbling in the newspapers, many institutions are still cold and clear; Beijing and Shanghai are rumbling in the thunder, but many cities are still cold and clear. Li Yi believes that even in Beijing, there are still many people who have many concerns. In the final analysis, they are all afraid of retaliation. They say: The three-part symphony of "blooming and contending" is: First, let it go; second, take it back; third, rectify. "Lure the enemy in deep and annihilate them in one fell swoop." The leaders of the Party are not all Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou. Monks are not Bodhisattvas, and Bodhisattvas have undergone hard cultivation. They are pure blue, and monks have not cultivated for a long time. What's more, there are many ways of retaliation, and many are covered up with the coat of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, several comrades in our Socialist Academy now cannot sleep at night, and their hearts are drumming. They dare not let it go, and it is uncomfortable to be bored in their hearts if they do not let it go. Some people say that the leadership should make further guarantees politically and organizationally. Some people hope that Chairman Mao will support them and publicly talk about not allowing retaliation. Some people say: Can we formulate measures to prohibit retaliation? Li Yi believes that if this problem is not solved, the atmosphere of "blooming and contending" will be difficult to form. We must oppose retaliation. We must create a "rats crossing the street, everyone shouting to kill" atmosphere for those who retaliate.

Li Yi also talked about who to rely on to run universities well. He said: The members of the Jiusan Society are all teachers in universities. According to the recent survey at Tsinghua University and the opinions recently raised by non-Party members in universities across the country, this problem has not been solved in many schools. He believes that this problem is very important, it is a policy and line problem, and it is the root cause of all contradictions in universities. Li Yi said that some people say that the leading thought of a certain president is: Old cadres plus Soviet experts can run universities well. Looking at the newspapers recently, many universities have prominent youth lines, that is to say, relying on young Party members, Youth League members, and activists to run universities well. This can be said to be a simple "political point of view." In the past few years, the main task was to transform old universities of a capitalist nature into new universities, with class struggle as the main focus, not production struggle. This approach made sense. Now the main thing is to turn a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, that is, the main problem is production struggle. It is wrong to emphasize relying on young people, and it is a mistake in the political line. Li Yi believes that today, it is abnormal for experts and scholars with higher scientific levels and more experience in running schools to have no say in running schools, and only see a few young people gesticulating, mobilizing troops and generals. Who should we rely on to run universities well? Li Yi clearly said that to run universities well, we must rely on the Party, rely on experts and scholars, and on this basis, mobilize all positive factors. Without the leadership of the Party, we cannot guarantee the socialist direction in universities. Without the participation of experts

    大胆开展批评　热烈进行争论
    统战部邀请民主党派和无党派民主人士继续座谈
    本报讯　中共中央统战部邀请各民主党派中央的负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会，休会四天后，于21日下午举行第八次会议。在这次会议上发言的有：中国民主同盟副主席章伯钧、中国国民党革命委员会常务委员邵力子、中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基、中国民主促进会副主席许广平、林汉达、无党派民主人士李德全、九三学社副秘书长李毅。刚从浙江来北京开会的中国民主建国会中央委员范尧峰，在今天的座谈会上作了书面发言。章伯钧说：
    现在工业方面有设计院  可是政治上没有设计院
    “共产党的民主精神已经得到了极大的效果。”
    民盟副主席章伯钧说，今天他谈个人的意见：第一点，近二十多天来，全国各地都在谈论人民内部矛盾，帮助共产党整风，提出了很多意见，看来是很正常的。共产党的领导，共产党的政策，共产党的批评和自我批评精神，民主精神，已经得到了极大的效果。这在中国政治史上和社会主义运动史上，都是一件新的事情。兄弟国家很重视。帝国主义国家想找我们的毛病，但找不到。比如近两周来提出的学校中的党委治校的问题，引起了很多的讨论。就我接触到的朋友来说，大家的看法基本接近，都认为共产党的领导是不可缺少的，党是可以从政治上领导科学的。但是，另一方面，大家也都感到这种制度有缺点，发生了宗派主义、教条主义和官僚主义的缺点。因此，大家认为应该更多地听取教授和学生的意见。这证明，鸣，放，并不影响共产党的领导，而是愈益提高了共产党的威信。
    现在应该提出进一步的要求。最近我参加了北京的一些座谈会，感到仍有人没有把话说完。在一次高级技术人员座谈会上，有人发言后问我到底怎样，下边可能顾虑更多。因此，今后应该彻底地广开言路。现在光是中上层人物的意见，固然能够反映很多方面的意见，但是，还应该普及到下层才好。下层干部在几年来对国家贡献很大，其功不小；但是犯了不少错误。因此希望这次整风能听一听基层人民的意见。
    “党内一决定就那么干下去是不能达到预期目的的。”
    其次，谈几个问题：几年来，特别是从去年政协会议以后，国家领导方面很重视各方面的意见，民主生活日渐丰富。今后有关国家的政策、方针性的重大问题，可以多听一听各方面的意见。如这次整风，结合检查改进工作，当然是好的。过去，作了许多轰轰烈烈的好事，但是，有些事情也给国家带来了损失。如果在工作进行之初，就多听听人大常委会、政协、民主党派的意见，就可以少走弯路。如扫盲运动、五年一贯制、推广双轮双铧犁等问题，如果事先经过国务院的部长们，根据材料，多方面地进行讨论，或经过民主党派、高级知识分子、专家的讨论，就会减少损失。如果党内一决定，就那么干下去，是不能达到预期的目的的。又如体制问题、中央和地方的分权问题，去年只交地方党委书记和少数党外高级干部进行讨论。主要是党内讨论。应该利用政协、人大的各种委员会、民主党派去讨论，这些人都有相当的认识和经验。再如文字改革，我认为既不是国防机密，又不是阶级斗争问题，是一个人民内部的矛盾问题，却只由少数热心分子作了讨论。这样，是不是人人都搞通了呢？我看包括党内的一些同志，大有问题，相当混乱。如果文字改革问题，等于社会主义、共产主义，我没有意见，我不能反对；如果是文化问题，就应该在党内外展开讨论，应该多从学术、政治、道理上进行讨论。
    陈梦家在文汇报上的意见，我部分地同意。
   “政协、人大、民主党派和人民团体，应该是政治上的设计院。”
    现在工业方面有许多设计院，可是政治上的许多设施，就没有一个设计院。我看政协、人大、民主党派、人民团体，应该是政治上的四个设计院。应该多发挥这些设计院的作用。一些政治上的基本建设，要事先交他们讨论，三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮。现在大学里对党委制很不满，应该展开广泛的讨论，制度是可以补充的，因为大家都是走社会主义的路。这样搞，民主生活的内容就会丰富起来。
    政协、人大不要等到期满，今年就可以进行明年所要作的大事的讨论，不能全靠视察制度，对国家准备作的事情要有经常的讨论。
    近来，政协委员到下面视察工作，工作是增多了。但还不能停留于视察工作，要进一步让大家经常讨论国家的重大问题。
    “国务院开会常拿出成品，这种形式主义的会议可以少开。”
    大多数教授都反映说会多，这要看什么样的会。假使是千篇一律的报告会，形式主义的会，最好是少开一点。比如国务院开会常是拿出成品要我们表示意见，这样的形式主义的会，是可以少开的，但如果能够提出问题，拿出材料认真讨论，有丰富的内容，能够发挥各个人的见解，这种会大家不会感到多的。关于体制问题，如何搞，大家可以深刻讨论，文字改革问题也可以由大家讨论。
    在政协、人大常委会里面，共产党中央要考虑放上一批能干的共产党员。共产党的许多领导同志，有知识，有精力，可否在统一安排的原则下，分配一部分参加到上述机构里面，经常同各方面的人士交换意见，而不要像现在的一些共产党的同志那样，只是看看你们怎么讲，今后人大常委会、政协讨论问题，各部应该有常务部长出席代表各部说明政策。这不是资本主义国家议会政治。
    近一两年来，政府对于老年的知识分子，有所安排，收到了极大的效果。但是，还有些名望较小的社会知识分子，思想已经起了很大变化，生活也有困难，政府应当有适当的政策，逐步地解决他们的问题。
    镇反、三反、肃反中的遗留问题，一再讨论，党和政府应该下决心，检查一下。检查要有准备，要好好作。
    中国共产党的统一战线政策，在革命中发生了极大的作用。这方面的经验还得总结一下。从马克思、列宁那里找理论根据教育共产党员，那固然必要；但是还不如从实际生活中，从孙中山同中国共产党合作开始直到现在的统一战线工作，作一个总结，对党员的教育作用更大。在作某一部门的总结的时候，也可以请有关的民主党派参加，这也可以少发生一点主观主义的毛病。
    邵力子、罗隆基、章伯钧一场争论
    邵力子说：文字改革在全国政协讨论过两三次，也交给地方政协讨论过，不是少数几个人关起门来搞的。
    邵力子说，我并不是想同章伯钧先生辩论。当然，在百家争鸣的时期，争辩也是可以的。不过，我的用意并不在这里。我只是想说明一个情况，使今后的讨论少浪费时间。我是参加了文字改革委员会工作的，伯钧先生说文字改革只是几个人关起门来搞的，这样说是太冤枉了。事实上，每个方案提出时，文字改革委员会都征求了社会各方面的意见，出版、印刷界的人士都曾举行过多次的座谈会。全国政协也讨论过两三次，并且也交地方政协讨论过。伯钧先生以全国政协副主席的身份，提出这样的意见就相当严重了。说政协没有讨论，不好这样讲。在过去征求意见时，伯钧先生没有注意到，他是领导同志，工作很忙，政协开会讨论时，或者没有来，或者来了没有注意听，或者听了没有发表意见。文字改革工作有缺点，当然可以批评，但是，放箭要放准，要有的放矢，不要乱放。说文字改革问题没有征求群众意见，是乱箭。
    罗隆基接着说，我也是民盟的，我不是闹宗派替伯钧先生辩护，但我要补充说明一些情况。文字改革问题，是讨论过的。当时讨论的是拼音文字方案，而不是讨论中国文字是不是要拼音。说到汉字简化，也没有讨论汉字简化的方向问题，拿出来讨论的是简化字。而且拿出来讨论时，说是党已经决定了，这样，如果展开讨论，就会说是反对党的政策。当时很多人是不敢讲话的。
    章伯钧接着说，邵力子先生对我的批评是对的。以前有些人说我是共产党的尾巴，百依百顺。但是，将汉字改为拼音文字，我是怀疑的，政协讨论时，陈毅叫我讲话，我不讲话。但是大家赞成通过，我也不反对。现在不是从法律程序上提出讨论，而是把它作为根本性的问题提出来讨论。
    罗隆基说，毛主席是赞成拼音化的，这样让大家讨论就很难发表意见了。
    邵力子反问说，既然你有意见，当时为什么不讲？现在把事情都推到共产党身上，太冤枉人。
    章伯钧回答说，今天就讲了嘛。许广平说：
    领导党和社会人士对民主促进会不重视
    许广平在发言中，首先批评领导党和社会人士对民主促进会不重视。她说，民进是个小党派，又是分工做中小学教师的工作，两“小”加起来，就很自然的引不起领导党和社会上一般人士的重视。如有一次我们要开会，事先通知统战部，争取领导党的帮助，但得到的回答是：某大党要开会，没工夫照顾你们。这样，我们就只好延期。她要求共产党对大小党派一视同仁。
    由于民进的成员是中小学教师，地方上很不重视，甚至对民进究竟是搞什么的也发生了疑问。光明日报登民进的消息也最少。因此，使我们在工作上遭受到不少困难。如房子问题，在民进就更为突出。民进总部和北京分会挤在一起，甚至连吃饭的地方都没有。人员编制也赶不上形势的发展，干部忙不过来，不能很好的开展工作。经费也是一减再减，其实我们在造预算时已是窄打窄用，一再削减以后就使得我们连必需的经费也感到困难。
    接着，她又说，有人认为民进是个小党，比较简单，大概没有什么问题。其实，民进是个知识分子的党派，不能说没有问题。民主党派如何发挥创造性独立性就是一个问题。当然，民主党派需要有共产党的领导，但是，如果民主党派做的事情于人民有利，不违犯政策，就应该发挥民主党派的创造性独立性。如过去我们民进到基层去发动群众和平签名，常常碰到干部说：党还没有布置，慢点作。我们也就只好收起来不作了。我以为像这类不违犯政策的事情，可以让民主党派多作一些。
    统上不统下的问题，许广平说，这种现象确实存在。基层单位对民主党派确实不了解，没有认识到它的作用。我们民进武汉分会成立时，很希望报馆派记者去参加。报馆工作人员说：你们开什么会？我们没有时间参加，再三联系无结果。最后经过我们的秘书长亲去报馆找负责人，才派了记者去参加。又如在北京某校开敬老会时，党、团、工会、行政、学生会、班代表都讲了话，最后才轮到民进。因此，民进成员有自卑感，也不舒服。会员并不是要争先后，但是也要适当安排。
    许广平还说：几年来，党对高级知识分子工作是做得不少，但是，对一般知识分子则很差。不仅有职无权，还感到职位不恰当。中小学校提拔干部偏重于党、团员，有些甚至是清一色的党员，有些教书教不了，才提升为干部。老教师不管经验多么丰富，也不能提拔。有些教师教学成绩不好，批准入党后马上可以被提拔。一般人士对中、小学教师尊重不够。北京某校不守纪律的学生多半是高级干部的子弟，等到学生发生问题了，这些干部就责备教师，有个学校的学生家长甚至到学校里抓住教师的衣领斥责，沈阳有一个教师甚至因此被带上手铐。很多青年不愿当中、小学教员，中、小学教员更重要的是要求多从政治上尊重他们、信任他们、培养他们。当然应该给予一定的物质鼓励和生活上的保障，但不是一分一毫的算，什么都给钱。有些地方改卷子有改卷子费，观摩教学有观摩教学费，这是资本主义的经营管理思想。许广平还谈到：高级知识分子要求保证有六分之五的时间从事研究工作，中学教师则无保证，也无具体方案。许多中小学教师任务过分繁重，女教师无暇管理家务，教育别人的人，无法教育自己的孩子。一般教师特别是语文教师忙乱不堪，这不但会影响健康，影响教学质量，而且对学生的品德教育也无暇顾及，以致有些学校发生偷窃现象。林汉达说：
    整个教育部都是有职无权
    教育部发通知下去，不灵，加上国务院，还不行，非得中共中央、国务院发联合指示才行。
    林汉达说，我刚视察回来，把下面的情绪反映一下。现在北京、上海等地高级知识分子鸣、放得很热闹，但是中小学教师、扫盲教师却不敢鸣、放。主要是有顾虑。有人反映：我上有老下有小，虽然我相信不会遭到打击报复，但总会吃亏的。现在正当精简，谁知道会不会被精简出去。
    教师在社会上没有地位，不被重视，这种情况很普遍。有人说小学教师好像低人一等，想不到比小学教师更低的还有业余教师，业余教师是低人二等。有个扫盲教师不敢让他的老婆知道他是扫盲教师，害怕她要离婚。这次我在上海跑了好几个厂，发现党团员也不重视业余教育，从他们的学习情况就可以看出来。有人反映：“群众是优秀生，团员是补课生，党员是留级生。”为什么会如此，是不是业余学习同生产有矛盾？不是，主要是安排问题，领导上不重视，学习时间就没有保证。
    统战部门偏重大党，对小党不重视。共产党内至今有些人不知道民进是作什么的。如果考一考“长期共存，互相监督”的统战政策，我看民主党派会及格，共产党员未必能及格。
    这次民主促进会在上海开了二省一市的座谈会，一共开了八天，而且开得很好。但是只有解放日报报道了，光明日报和其他报纸都没有登，人民日报我们根本不敢希望。民盟开了三天会，各报都去了。大党开会三天，大登特登，小党大鸣大放也不管。
    关于有职有权问题，林汉达说，我不是讲我个人有职无权，而是说整个教育部都是有职无权。很多事情，教育部不知道。教育部发通知下去，不灵，加上国务院，还不行，非得中共中央、国务院发联合指示才行。政府部门有什么用？肯定你有成绩，就有成绩，说有偏差，就有偏差。比如1952年把祁建华一捧捧到天上，好像仓颉第二，孔夫子第二，第二年就打下去了，统统否定了。
    扫盲工作，1954—1955年做得比较好，1956年有冒进。冒进主要表现在规划上，把七年完成的任务说成三年五年，实际上是纸上谈兵。到春耕的时候扫盲工作本来已是在走下坡路了，人民日报还发表了一篇社论，纠正盲目冒进。人民日报社论那里来的？教育部的部长都不知道。谁能够指挥教育部呢？说1956年扫除文盲九百万人，其实这是1954—1955年的成绩，1956年的要到1958年才能看到成绩。
    林汉达谈到这里，马寅初插了一句说：人民日报没有根据是不会登的。
    接着林汉达谈到业余教育的课本和教材问题。他说，工农业余学习，每周要保证六小时、八小时，采用正规学校的课本，显然是不可能的，有教育常识的人，都不会这么办。这个决定事先我并不知道，但是检讨还得我作，因为我是业余教育方面的负责人，就得检讨官僚主义。课本、参考书都成问题，为什么？因为命运掌握在新华书店手里。新华书店只供应中小学，而不供应业余学校，给那里多少就是多少，不给就是不给。如果不只有一个新华书店，而且有一个“华新书店”，那会好一些。
    区里的文教助理，人家都说他们是文教不理，教育科是不务正业科，原因在于地方上的领导干部不重视文教工作。地方上还有歧视和侮辱业余教师的现象。有人说：“有饭给扫盲教师吃，宁可给狗吃。”上海市有人反映业余教师是三不管的工作人员。这是从中央、包括教育部到地方都不重视的结果。但是业余学校肩负的责任是很重的，单是上海就有八十九万业余学校的学生。我们不光替中小学教师呼吁，还要替业余教师呼吁。现在上海的报纸已经在替业余教师说话了，北京还没有。这种不重视业余教育的情况如果不转变，对社会主义事业会有很大的影响。李德全说：
    卫生工作与每个人都有关系希望各方面帮助解决现存问题
    李德全发言说，卫生工作同六亿人民甚至在肚子里还没有出生的人都有关系，大家对这方面的缺点有意见是必然的。另一方面，卫生部也有三个主义。在生活福利和使用干部方面，有宗派主义的缺点；公费医疗是主观主义的。它是在供给制的基础上发展起来的。当时，我们没有量量人力、物力，也没有考虑在一些人的头脑中，还有非社会主义思想意识，不爱惜国家财产，因此，过早实行这个制度，会给国家带来损失，产生浪费现象。同时，这也是个超过了社会主义的制度。据说，苏联的工作人员现在看病还要自己花钱买药。他说这个错误首先是卫生部门的错误。接着李德全批评了卫生工作中的教条主义和官僚主义。他说：卫生工作中的教条主义表现在，苏联有些好的东西，对我们并不一定实用的，但也硬搬、硬学。官僚主义表现在：我们同高级知识分子联系不够，在工作中，没有更多地请教他们，常是从主观出发地决定问题。如医院的组织、制度，应该同办医院的人商量；办医学教育，就应该同医学教育的专家商讨，但是我们过去作的都不够。从我们部来看，下面有干部反映：部长和他们联系不够，从这里看，我认为党提出解决人民内部矛盾问题，是适时的。大家都把问题提出来了，也有改进的愿望。但是能否都解决，还要看客观条件。
    根据以上各点，她希望各方面帮助卫生部：一、解决公费医疗制度中的问题。二、医学院学习年限，可否改为六年制？也请大家考虑。三、在学习中医的问题上，怎样安排得适当？现在因为我们安排得不够合适。有的中医说，他们只是一朵好看的纸花。
    最后她提出两个问题。她说，资本主义国家的妇女受到教育而很少有参加政治活动的机会，我们情况完全不同，但是仍有问题。有人对于那些在革命中贡献过自己的力量，而没有时间去提高自己的文化素养的女干部，有那么一种想法：你们回家去吧。她希望给予这些女同志一个提高文化的机会，使她们好好工作。
    关于学习苏联的问题。她说，在抗日战争期间，苏联帮助过我们，这是我亲自看到的。解放以后，苏联的帮助就更多了。单从卫生工作方面来看，1947年，东北发生鼠疫，多少人患病！人们一提鼠疫，谈虎色变，六亲不认。解放初期，察、蒙地区发生鼠疫，怕传染开来，铁路交通断绝。当时苏联应我国政府之请，立刻派了专家工作队，在两个星期内就扑灭了鼠疫。这说明，苏联一直是帮助我们的，苏联也有很多东西值得我们学习。我们学习苏联是正确的。苏联显然也有些前进中的缺点，但是方向是正确的。不能因为我们过去有些东西搬用不当，而一下子把他脱出去。说到这里，李德全更加明确地说：我们对于学习苏联应该有正确的认识，苏联是我们的好朋友，应该向他学习，但是在学习时，要合乎我们的客观情况，不要把一条腿当成一棵树。范尧峰书面发言批评统战部：
    “统上不统下，统老不统少，统新不统旧，统男不统女”
    我从浙江来到北京开会，看到北京的政治空气，真是一片春光明媚，百花齐放的景象。我看到社会主义民主高潮出现了。在下面工作了两年，一到北京，觉得北京的太阳比下面温暖多了。因此我愿以一个民主党派中央委员的身分，不揣固陋，主动地以书面参加座谈，以尽我的责任。提出三点建议：
    一、中央统战部的眼睛要多多往下看。统战工作何等重要，尽人皆知。大家说过，统战部过去有“统上不统中”、“统上不统下”的缺点，我要补充三条，还有“统老不统少”、“统新不统旧”、“统男不统女”的毛病。这是社会上一般人的反映。建议今后上中下老少新旧男女全面地统起来。因为中下面最广，潜力最大，中年壮年正是有为之年，旧同志关系深，不统不会见怪，统统对工作大有好处，目前一般人确有这样的感觉：“相府门前七品官”、“侯门深似海”，要见领导同志真不容易，其原因我想有二：一是领导本身，一是下面的风气造成的围墙。如我到浙江二年，还没有正式见过省领导同志（仅是听报告开会的遥见），建议中央统战部领导同志多多到下面视察，召开这样的座谈会。
    有个同志打比喻，说党员把非党员“当做一只鸟，捏在手里，捏紧了怕捏死，放松了怕飞了。
    二、让民主党派人士在各项工作上尽量多负起责来。我的看法民主人士一般都有了“职”，问题便出在“职”、“权”两字上，情况很复杂，问题的根本在于“职、责、权”三者的统一。而其中的关键则是让他们在工作上像党员一样都负起责来，负了责，怎会无权？目前的问题是有些党组织和党员不大肯让非党人士多负责，好像只有党员才会负责做事，非党人士负不起责，有个同志打比喻，好像把我们当做一只鸟，捏在手里，捏紧了怕捏死，放松了怕飞了。没有责，是不会有权的。因此，为了建设社会主义，我主张让能负多少责任的人做多少事情，能负多少责任的人便行使多少权力，这就是社会主义社会的人事制度。
    三、民主党派的内部矛盾的处理要依靠发动群众。民主党派的内部矛盾很多，而且很复杂。民主党派内部矛盾的处理对于人民内部矛盾的处理作用很大。譬如章乃器同志提到民建会的内部矛盾，那就更复杂了。这次路过上海，听到几位中委同志说起，上海民建会整个工作可以用两个字“蹋班”代表：（意思是一切落后于客观形势与要求）。上海是民建工作的重点，为什么会一切“蹋班”呢？我认为是内部矛盾还未引起足够的认识。只有依靠群众才能正确处理内部矛盾，希望统战部帮助民建会处理内部矛盾，这对民建会协助党和政府处理人民内部矛盾的作用是很大的。
    李毅对章乃器和黄绍竑的发言有意见
    他说：墙是双方砌的，需要双方主动，才能推倒
    又说：强调成绩使人骄傲，但强调缺点也会使人迷失方向
    李毅反映许多人对开展批评顾虑重重
    他认为应该制定禁止打击报复的办法
    李毅说：现在，非党人士帮助党整风，提了很多意见，鸣、放的高潮正在形成，有人有怀疑，我看很健康，不是糟得很，是好得很，不是放得太多，是放得还不够。有人说：目前还只有四、五级风。为什么呢？他说：报纸上虽然雷声震耳，可是，很多机关还是冷冷清清；北京、上海雷声震耳，很多城市还是冷冷清清。李毅认为：就是北京，也还有许多人顾虑重重，归根结底，都是怕打击报复，他们说：鸣、放三部曲，一放；二收；三整。“诱敌深入，聚而歼之”。党的领导人不都是毛主席、周总理，和尚不是菩萨，菩萨是经过苦修苦炼的，炉火纯青，和尚修炼时间不长。何况打击的方式是多种多样的，有许多是用马列主义的外衣掩盖起来的。所以我们社会主义学院现在就有好几个同志夜里睡不着觉，心里打鼓，放吧不敢，不放吧，闷在心里又难受。有人说：领导上应该从政治上、组织上作出进一步的保障，有人希望毛主席撑腰，公开讲讲不准打击报复。有人说：能不能制定禁止打击报复的办法。李毅认为：这个问题如果不解决，鸣、放的空气很难形成。一定要反对打击报复，对于打击报复者要造成“老鼠过街、人人喊打”的风气。
    李毅还谈到：依靠谁办好高等学校。他说：九三学社的成员都是高等学校的教师，根据最近在清华大学的调查和最近各地高等学校非党人士提的意见，这个问题在许多学校里没有解决。他认为这个问题很重要，是政策路线问题，是高等学校一切矛盾的根源。李毅说：有人说：某院长的领导思想是：老干部加苏联专家就可以办好高等学校。从最近的报纸上看，很多高等学校都存在着突出的青年路线，就是说：依靠青年党、团员、积极分子办好高等学校。这可以说是一种单纯的“政治观点”。在过去几年中，主要的任务是把资本主义性质的旧大学改造成为新大学，以阶级斗争为主，不是以生产斗争为主，这种作法是有一定的道理的。现在主要是变落后的农业国为先进的工业国，即主要是生产斗争的问题，如果再强调依靠青年，就是错误的，而且是政治路线上的错误。李毅认为：在今天，有较高的科学水平和较多的办学经验的专家学者们在办学中没有发言权，只看见少数小伙子指手划脚、调兵遣将的局面是不正常的。究竟应该依靠谁办好高等学校呢？李毅明确地说：办好高等学校，必须依靠党、依靠专家学者，并且在这个基础上，调动一切积极因素。没有党的领导，就不能保证高等学校中的社会主义方向，没有专家、学者参加领导，就不能提高学术水平，提高教学质量。目前，在高等学校中，尊重专家、学者的空气很稀薄。他建议：在依靠党、依靠专家、学者办好高等学校，并在此基础上调动一切积极因素的指导思想下，来考虑修改目前高等学校的领导体制。
    李毅还说他和章乃器先生有一点争鸣，他说：章先生在人民日报发表了一篇文章——“墙”和“沟”的思想基础是什么？章先生认为：“墙”和“沟”的思想基础是斯大林说的，“我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人，我们是由特殊材料制成的”。因此，“不少非党人士便以特殊的眼光看待党员，某些修养不够的党员，也就不免以特殊自居了。”我认为章先生只说明了问题的一个方面，从党的方面来说，这样说很具体，也相当深刻；但是，忽略了问题的另一方面，即非党方面。事实上，墙是双方砌的，沟是双方挖的，需要双方主动，才能推倒墙，填平沟。“墙”和“沟”并不是今天才有的，在阶级斗争消灭以前，墙更厚，沟更宽，可以说是铜墙铁壁，深沟高垒。几年来，从全国范围来看，党与非党的墙不是更高更厚了，而是薄了，低了，沟不是更宽更深了，而是窄了，浅了。从局部看，由于在几次运动中的偏差，和部分党员特殊思想的发展，使一部分非党人士和党的距离不是近了，而是远了。我认为还是应该从总的情况来看。党员的不健康的思想作风和工作上的缺点，是造成墙和沟的重要因素。解放以来，我个人的经验，也证明了这一点。解放初期，我和一位党员共事，这位同志有点特殊感，不到半年，关系就弄得有点紧张，有“墙”和“沟”。以后，我和另外二位党员共事，这两位同志很虚心，彼此关系搞得很好，工作也愉快，就不感到有“墙”、“沟”存在。以后又和另一位同志共事，这位同志的特殊感更重，“墙”、“沟”又有了。但是，李毅认为：这仅是问题的一方面，另一方面，非党人士学习、改造情况，和“墙”“沟”的存在与否也有很大关系，我自己回忆了一下，七、八年来，起初，我同党员共事，意见很多。以后，领导上派我下乡调查，自己思想进步了，有了改变。回来后，双方关系就有了改善。再如北京某公私合营企业，原来一位姓倪的经理和工人之间关系很坏，工人叫他“赤佬”。后来他经过学习，工人就叫他“资本家”。后来，他主动争取合营，当了经理，更有进步，工人叫他“倪经理”。高潮以后，他又经过学习，放下架子，联系群众，积极搞好企业，工人感到他和公方代表区别不大，叫他“老倪”。从这个例子，李毅得出结论说：可以肯定：企业的改造和个人思想的改造对于消除“墙”和“沟”很有关系。所以，我认为：目前“墙”和“沟”的思想基础是党员和非党员的资产阶级思想，因此，解决问题的办法应该是：党和非党双方的思想改造，并在此基础上，建立必要的制度加以保障。
    李毅还说：和黄绍竑先生也有一点争鸣。对于如何估计成绩和缺点的问题，黄绍竑先生认为成绩是主要的，偏差错误是难免的，这已成为公式。我认为黄先生指出掩盖缺点、夸大成绩的偏向是对的；但是，因为要纠正这个偏向，就把缺点放在前面，也是不对的。我认为应该恰如其分，实事求是，既不夸大成绩，也不夸大缺点，有一分成绩，就说一分成绩，有一分缺点，就说一分缺点。强调成绩，会使人自满，强调缺点也会使人迷失方向，丧失信心，造成是非不分，影响干部的团结，可以回忆一下，去年波匈事件闹得很厉害，其中有一个原因就是对成绩和缺点的估计有问题，所以还是实事求是为好。
    黄绍竑声明说：我并没有夸大缺点的意思，我是主张把缺点放在显著的地位，目的是在于引起注意，不要忽视缺点。
