Youth League Congress Delegates and Foreign Guests
Participate in Voluntary Labor at the Temple of Heaven

    (Our Newspaper) News: On the morning of May 19th, three vibrant youth teams, waving red flags and singing songs, set off towards the Tian Tan (Temple of Heaven) Park's garden field. These were more than 1,400 youth representatives attending the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League, who, together with cadres from the Central Committee of the League, went there to participate in voluntary labor, including digging ditches, carrying manure, turning soil, weeding, and leveling the land.
    When the presidium of the congress proposed that the delegates participate in physical labor on the afternoon of the 17th, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. They wanted to use this physical labor to practically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and set an example for cadres and educated youth of the Communist Youth League throughout the country. Guan Huiming, secretary of the Communist Youth League Shaoguan Prefectural Committee in Guangdong, only has one hand and is not in good health. The head of the Guangdong delegation advised him not to participate, but he insisted on going, saying, "I have one hand, and I can do the work of one hand."
    At 7:50 a.m., the delegates arrived at the work site. Hu Yaobang, the general commander, briefly explained the significance of the voluntary labor to the delegates, and then the delegates from each province headed to their respective labor sites according to the predetermined goals.
    The foreign guests from fifteen countries who came to attend the meeting also canceled their planned visit to Tianjin and joined in the labor.
    A fierce labor competition began. The Xinjiang delegation first proposed a competition with the Tibet and Guizhou delegations in turning soil. After the competition began, the Tibet delegation completed the task of turning soil in one hour and five minutes. The Xinjiang and Guizhou delegates did not show weakness either, and after completing the task of turning soil in one hour and thirty minutes, they immediately went to support the Qinghai Province delegates in carrying manure. Wang Zhanxian (Miao nationality), Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Guizhou Provincial Committee, carried more than 30 loads of manure in a row, each weighing over 100 catties.
    The delegates from the northeastern provinces were assigned to work in the third work area. The task of the third work area was to dig ditches, more than 50 meters long and about one meter deep. The soil there was hard and there were many stones, making the project quite arduous. Zhang Youcheng, Director of the Youth and Agriculture Department of the Communist Youth League Jilin Provincial Committee, regardless of difficulties, first led a group of vanguards to dig out large stones with picks, and transported them one by one to the outside of the ditch, and then carried out digging soil. He could dig more than ten centimeters with one pick on the hard soil, and he worked for two hours without resting. The Secretary of the Communist Youth League Jilin Provincial Committee exclaimed: "Look at how strong Zhang Youcheng, who comes from a peasant family, is. I, who come from a student background, am far behind him in labor. I must step up my training!"
    Ouyang Yunlian, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Tiandong County Committee in Guangxi, who was leading students from Beijing No. 58 Middle School in weeding in the garden field, was spoken to by Comrade Shaoqi when the responsible comrades of the CPC Central Committee met with the delegates on the afternoon of the 15th. Because she was too excited, she had not slept well for two consecutive nights. She told reporters: "Comrade Shaoqi said that you are a grassroots cadre of the Communist Youth League, and you need to participate in physical labor and production more often! Only by learning production and being familiar with production can you do a good job in the work of the Communist Youth League among the working youth." After writing down these words that Comrade Shaoqi had told her in her diary, Ouyang Yunlian continued: I am determined to devote a quarter of my time to physical labor every year from this year on, and respond to the call of the Party with my practical actions, and guide the other five student-born Communist Youth League cadres in the county to participate in physical labor.
    By 10:30 a.m., the entire project was successfully completed. In two and a half hours, they excavated 3,400 cubic meters of earth, turned soil and weeded more than 120 mu, and carried more than 2,400 loads of manure, completing the workload of 400 labor days in two and a half hours.

    青年团代表大会的代表和外宾
    在天坛参加义务劳动
    本报讯　5月19日早晨，有三支生气勃勃的青年队伍，打着红旗，唱着歌，向着天坛公园的园林场进发。这就是出席青年团第三次全国代表大会的一千四百多名青年代表，他们和团中央的干部们一起，到那里去参加挖水沟、担大粪、翻土、锄草和平整园地的义务劳动。
    当17日的下午大会主席团提议与会代表参加一次体力劳动的时候，整个会场响起了震耳欲聋的掌声和欢呼声。他们要用这次体力劳动来实际响应党中央的号召，在全国青年团的干部和知识青年中树立一个榜样。广东韶关团地委书记关惠明只有一只手，身体也不好，广东代表团团长劝他不要参加，他仍坚决地去了，并说：“我有一只手，就能干一只手的活”。
    七时五十分代表们来到了工作现场，大队总指挥胡耀邦同志对代表们简要地讲解了这次义务劳动的意义之后，各省代表按照预定目标各自奔向自己的劳动场地。
    前来出席会议的十五个国家的外宾们，也取消了预定到天津参观的计划，一齐参加了劳动。
    激烈的劳动竞赛开始了。新疆代表团首先提出同西藏、贵州的代表展开翻土竞赛，竞赛开始后，西藏代表团以一小时零五分的时间完成了翻土任务。新疆、贵州的代表也不示弱，他们以一小时三十分的时间完成了翻土任务之后，随即去支援青海省的代表担大粪。贵州省团省委副书记王占先（苗族），一连担了三十多担大粪，每担都在百斤以上。
    东北各省的代表被分配在第三工区工作。三工区的任务是挖水沟，沟长五十多公尺，约一公尺深。那里土坚石多，工程相当艰巨。吉林省团省委青农部长张有成，不怕困难，首先带领一部分尖兵用镐把大石头掘出，一个一个地运到沟外，然后再进行挖土。他在坚硬的土地上一镐下去就能掘十多公分，他一直劳动了两个小时还没有休息。团吉林省委书记感叹地说：你看那位农民出身的张有成多有力，我这个学生出身的人劳动起来比他可差的太远了，不加紧锻炼可不行啊！”
    正带领着北京五十八中的学生在园地上拔草的广西田东县团委书记欧阳云连，15日下午中共中央负责同志和代表们见面时，少奇同志曾和她谈过话，她由于心情过于兴奋，曾一连两天晚上没睡好觉，她告诉记者说：“少奇同志说，你是团的基层干部，更需要经常参加体力劳动，参加生产啊！只有学习生产，熟悉生产，才能在劳动青年中做好团的工作。”欧阳云连同志在自己的日记上记述了少奇同志嘱咐她的这些话之后，接着写道：我下决心从今年起每年抽出四分之一的时间参加体力劳动，用自己的实际行动响应党的号召，并引导县里其他五个学生出身的团干部参加体力劳动。
    到十点三十分，全部工程胜利完成了，他们在两个半小时内就挖土方三千四百个立方，翻地、锄草一百二十多亩，担大粪两千四百多担，两个半小时之内完成了四百个劳动日的工作量。（附图片）
