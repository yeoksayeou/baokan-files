The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has encouraged every scientist. We have not spoken out enough. This is certainly because scientific research must have a fairly long process, but it is not entirely because we have no worries. Chairman Mao instructed us to continue to boldly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and said not to be afraid of poisonous weeds but to seek truth in struggle, which has eliminated many of our concerns.

I think that the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend has three types of applications in scientific work. First,展开 (zhǎnkāi) criticism and discussion in academics. A lot of work has been done in this category, but the disadvantage is that the scope is not wide enough and not deep enough. Second, boldly publish monographs and offer special lectures such as history lectures. The achievements of this category are also certain, but there are fewer of them. Third, scientific preparation work, that is, laying a solid foundation for various sciences, so that those who cannot speak can speak, and those who can speak can speak better. From a long-term perspective, the third type of work is more important than the first two, but precisely this type of work is not done enough. At present, there is a tendency to think that the method of promoting scientific research is only to ask people to choose topics and write papers; thus, we often see reports of a certain unit setting hundreds or dozens of topics. It seems that the twelve-year scientific plan will be completed six years ahead of schedule. However, papers and monographs are only the results of scientific research. We require the sound of research results, not "the thunder of earthenware pots." If we do not prepare conditions for people in advance and do not let people study diligently, but only know to work overtime to write papers for the sake of discussion, it is undoubtedly forcing growth. For sciences that cannot speak or do not speak well, we must especially do the work of preparing conditions. We are now neglecting this type of work.

The policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend will naturally make every intellectual think of the science he is engaged in. Therefore, I want to talk about issues related to world history. I think that the science of world history is not currently receiving the attention it deserves. Before liberation, it was only a science with semi-colonial nature that peddled Western knowledge; because our country got rid of its semi-colonial status, it got rid of its semi-colonial nature. We have cultivated some native-born world history experts, we have been carrying out world history research work, and we already have our own views on certain historical issues. However, these achievements are still very small. Because its original foundation is too weak, the quality of world history teachers in institutions of higher learning is not high enough, and the quantity is even further from objective needs. The most serious thing is that there is a lack of successors. Young people are unwilling to study world history. The reason is not that they are afraid of difficulties, but that this science has not received enough attention, so they feel that there is no future in studying it.

Have our leaders neglected world history? No! World history already has its due position in the twelve-year scientific plan, and the educational leadership department also takes considerable care of the development of world history. However, some comrades who directly lead scientific research work obviously adopt a neglecting, or even rejecting, attitude towards world history. We believe that as far as world history is concerned, its main contradiction is also the contradiction between the requirements of advanced scientific levels and the backward scientific reality. The current main task is to solve this contradiction. At present, what is urgently needed is a series of preparatory work, such as expanding the team, compiling specialized books and historical materials, purchasing and organizing materials, compiling reference books, and understanding the bottom line of advanced levels. We have made specific suggestions on how to promote these tasks and how to organize the forces scattered across the country to avoid the wasteful phenomenon of each doing their own thing and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. These suggestions have not received the support they deserve. Regarding the issue of books and materials, we have raised it more than once in symposiums, and also to the relevant responsible comrades, but the result is that it is ignored. We urgently request to run a magazine related to world history, hoping that in addition to using it to publish papers, we can also use it to introduce advanced achievements and scientific developments, exchange and discuss the experience of various tasks, and publish a large number of historical materials and book reviews. These are not things that general history journals can accommodate. We also hope to connect the forces scattered across the country through this magazine. We cannot imagine that in today's world, when every science has one or several publications, world history cannot have a place to contend. University journals cannot meet this requirement, because academic publications should be as specialized as possible. The reason why university journals are not valued is that they are a hodgepodge. Our suggestion was not opposed by the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but was stopped by administrative orders. World history does not have first-class scholars, so it has no say in the department. We can only retreat in the face of difficulties. After repeated efforts to run into walls, we not only have concerns, but also feel somewhat depressed; we are wondering: is the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend not necessary to be implemented in world history? After listening to Chairman Mao's speech, we know that our suspicions are wrong. However, world history requires leadership but has no leadership, and a magazine should be run but is not allowed to be run. If it is not sectarianism at work, is there a problem of leadership lagging behind the masses?

Our science is backward, and of course it is impossible to ask all sciences to advance at the same pace. We should line up, and it may be okay to put world history at the end, as long as we don't throw it out of the line. I originally agreed to establish the World History Institute in 1958, but now I am a little shaken, because I am afraid that it will be somewhat unworthy of its name after it is established. It is better to first establish some small scientific strongholds in various universities. In order to organize the forces, we suggest that a World History Society be established first, and it will carry out all the work related to preparing conditions, with the publication of a world history magazine as the center. With the organization of the society, we can determine the direction of our efforts through it. We are now generally distressed because the direction is not clear. During the period of boldly implementing the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, the comrades responsible for promoting this work may find it difficult to lead. Then, please consider the words of Vice Minister Zhou Yang: "Rely on scientists and artists, cooperate well with them, trust them, and consult with them more when things happen." We urgently need leadership.

Finally, I must add a statement: the world history mentioned above is actually only Western history; it was only because of the dogmatic arbitrariness that it was misappropriated for so many years. The dogmatists used big labels such as "the West is brought by imperialists," "Western history is Western European centrism," and "opposing the name of world history is not being humble in learning from advanced experience" to subdue people; they never paid attention to the fact that we already had the saying "Zheng He's voyages to the West," and that "east" and "west" are only relative terms. How immodest it is to force Western history, which does not include Chinese history and Asian history, to encompass the world! Science requires that names match reality. I suggest that we should still consider using the name Western history, unless we can come up with a more appropriate name.

    要重视世界史这门科学
    杨人楩
    百家争鸣的方针鼓舞了每一个科学工作者。我们鸣得还不够，这固然是由于科学研究必须有一个相当长的过程，然而也并非不是由于完全没有顾虑。毛主席指示要继续放手贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，并且说不要怕毒草而要在斗争中求真理，这就消除了我们不少的顾虑。
    百家争鸣的方针具体应用到科学工作上，我以为有三类形式。第一、在学术上展开批评与讨论，这一类工作做得已经很多，缺点在于面不够宽，不够深入。第二、放手出版专著和开设专题讲座如历史讲座之类，这一类的成绩也是肯定的，只是嫌少了一些。第三、科学的准备工作，即替各门科学打一个结实的基础，使不能鸣者能鸣，能鸣者鸣得更好。从长远来看，第三类的工作比前两类是更重要些，但是，恰恰是这一类工作做得很不够。目下有这样一种倾向：认为推动科学研究的方法只是叫人选定题目，写出论文；于是我们时常看见某单位定出几百几十个题目的报道。看样子，十二年科学规划要提前六年完成。可是，论文与专著只是科学研究的结果。我们要求有研究成果的鸣，不是“瓦釜雷鸣”。事先不给人准备条件，不让人踏踏实实去钻研，只知为讨论而加班加点地写论文，无疑是拔苗助长。对于不能鸣或鸣得不好的科学，尤其要做准备条件的工作。我们现在正忽略了这一类工作。
    百家争鸣的方针自然会使每一个知识分子想到他所从事的那一门科学，因此，我要谈谈有关世界史的问题。我认为，目前世界史这门科学是没有受到它所应有的重视的。在解放以前，它只是一门贩卖西洋知识的具有半殖民地性质的科学；由于我们的国家摆脱了半殖民地的地位，它才摆脱了半殖民地的性质。我们已培养了一些土生土长的世界史专家，我们已在进行世界史的研究工作，对于某些历史问题我们已有我们自己的看法。然而这些成绩仍是非常微小的。由于它的原有基础太薄弱，所以高等院校世界史教师的质量还不够高，量则离客观需要更远。最严重的是继起乏人，青年人不愿学世界史，原因不在于怕困难而在于这门科学没有受到足够的重视，因而觉得学了也没有前途。
    我们的领导是否忽视了世界史呢？没有！在十二年科学规划中世界史已有其应有的地位，教育领导部门也相当照顾到世界史的发展。可是，直接领导科学研究工作的某些同志们，对于世界史显然采取了忽视、甚至是排斥的态度。我们认为就世界史而论，它的主要矛盾也正是先进的科学水平的要求与落后的科学现实之间的矛盾，当前的主要任务就是要解决这一矛盾。目前急需着手的是一系列的准备条件的工作，如扩大队伍、编译专书和史料、购置及整理资料，编纂工具书，摸先进水平的底等等。我们曾具体建议如何推动这些工作，如何组织分散在全国的力量以免各搞一套的浪费现象而收分工合作之效，这些建议都得不到应有的支持。关于图书资料的问题，我们不止一次在座谈会上提出，也不止一次向有关负责同志提出，结果是不予理睬。我们迫切要求办一个有关世界史的杂志，希望除利用它来发表论文外，还可用它来介绍先进成果与科学动态，交流并讨论各种工作的经验，大量刊登史料与书评，这些都不是一般史学刊物所能容纳的。我们也希望通过这个杂志来联系分散在全国的力量。我们不可能想像在各门科学都有一个或几个刊物的今日，而世界史不能有一个争鸣的场合。学报不能满足这一要求，因为学术性的刊物应当是愈专门愈好，学报之所以不能受到重视就在于它是一个杂烩。我们这一建议没有遭到科学院哲学社会科学学部的反对，却遭到了行政命令的制止。世界史没有第一流的学者，所以在学部里没有发言权，我们只有知难而退。在一再努力都遭到碰壁以后，我们不但有顾虑，而且有些消沉；我们在怀疑：百家争鸣的方针是不是不须贯彻到世界史呢？听了毛主席的讲话以后，我们知道我们的怀疑是错误的。可是，世界史要求有领导而没有领导，应当办杂志而不让办杂志，假使不是宗派主义作祟的话，是否存在有领导落后于群众的问题呢？
    我们的科学落后，当然不可能叫各门科学都齐头并进。应当排排队，不妨把世界史排在末尾，只要不把它抛在队外。我原是赞成在1958年设立世界史研究所的，现在有些动摇了，因为怕成立了以后会有些名不副实，还不如先在各大学设立一些小型科学据点为好。为了要把力量组织起来，我们建议先成立一个世界史学会，由它来进行一切有关准备条件的工作，目前以出版世界史杂志为中心。有了学会的组织，我们就可透过它来决定我们努力的方向，我们现在就因为方向不明确而普遍感到苦恼。在放手贯彻百家争鸣的时期中，负责推动这一工作的同志可能会感到难于领导，那么，请考虑一下周扬副部长的话：“依靠科学家、艺术家，要很好地和他们合作，信赖他们，遇事多和他们商量”。我们迫切需要领导。
    最后，我必须附带声明一点：以上所指的世界史其实只是西洋史；只因教条主义者的武断才让它张冠李戴地搞了这么几年。教条主义者曾用“西洋是帝国主义者带来的东西”、“西洋史是西欧本位主义”、“反对世界史的名称就是不虚心学习先进经验”等大帽子来压服人；就不曾理会我们早就有“三宝太监下西洋”之说，东西只是相对的字样，硬把不包括中国史和亚洲史的西洋史来囊括世界是何等不谦虚！科学是要求名实相副的，我建议还是应当考虑用西洋史这一名称，除非我们能够想出更恰当的名称。
