Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 20th. Antara News Agency reported that Hatta is scheduled to return to Jakarta today. Yesterday, at a mass rally in Central Sumatra, he expressed admiration for the "achievements" of the "Banteng Division Committee," which has betrayed the central government.

At this rally and at another earlier conference, Hussein, the chairman of the so-called "Banteng Division Committee," and Simbolon, who failed in his military secession, also spoke. Like Hatta, they denied that their actions of betraying the central government were separatist activities. Simbolon also said that he was very fortunate to "have such a loyal leader as Hatta."

    哈达在中苏门答腊讲话
    表示敬佩“雄牛师”集团
    新华社雅加达20日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，哈达今天将要回到雅加达。昨天他在中苏门答腊的一个群众集会上讲话，对背叛中央的“雄牛师委员会”的“成就”表示敬佩。
    在这次集会和早些时候举行的另一次大会上，所谓“雄牛师委员会”的主席侯赛尼和进行军事割据失败的西姆波朗也都讲了话。他们同哈达一样，否认他们背叛中央的行动是分裂主义的活动。西姆波朗还说，“有哈达这样忠实的领袖”，他很庆幸。
