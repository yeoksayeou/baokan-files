Shanghai Old Workers Discuss Current Internal Contradictions Among the People
Oppose Withdrawal of Public Representatives and Twenty Years of Fixed Interest

(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 21st dispatch) What are the views of workers regarding the current heated discussions on internal contradictions among the people? Some veteran workers in Shanghai expressed many opinions at a symposium held yesterday by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.

Many veteran workers said in their speeches that, based on their own personal experiences, the achievements of the Party and the government in their work should be the main aspect. The current atmosphere in the newspapers, which is full of criticism of shortcomings, seems to give the impression that our work is full of shortcomings and has no achievements. Chen Chanan of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration’s Line Management Office said: Newspapers are full of criticism now. Criticism is necessary. It is good to resolve internal contradictions among the people by criticizing shortcomings. However, it is not good to only criticize without self-criticism. It is a bit unclear about right and wrong to only talk about one side. To resolve contradictions, it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong. Xu Hegen, a veteran worker at the Shanghai Railway Administration’s Electrical Affairs Section, said: Some people currently say that the Party and the government are managing things too tightly and too much, and that the enthusiasm of the people has been completely controlled. I don't think this is appropriate. I want to say that under the leadership of the Party and the government, the enthusiasm and creativity of our working class have been greatly brought into play. Lin Huitang of Xinmin Machine Factory said: Our factory originally developed by employing dozens of child laborers. Before the joint venture, the factory was in great difficulty. The capitalist wanted to get rid of the burden and asked the government to send someone to manage it as soon as possible. After the joint venture, the factory's production developed rapidly, and both output and quality have improved a lot. Pan Qizhuo of Shanghai No. 1 Construction Engineering Company also said: In the old society, we construction workers were the most despised. People called us "sloppy mud and smelly paint craftsmen." Our lives were simply not human lives, so-called "eating salty soup, sleeping without a bed." We suffered enough. Now, our situation is very different. Last "May Day," our construction workers also enjoyed the labor insurance regulations. We no longer have to worry about birth, old age, sickness, and death. Every year, we build dormitories, schools, and factories for workers, students, and intellectuals. Isn't this an achievement under the leadership of our Party and government!

Regarding some private sector personnel's proposal to withdraw public representatives from joint public-private enterprises, veteran workers unanimously expressed different opinions. Yang Yongkang of Minfu Textile and Dyeing Factory said: Public representatives are the representatives of our working class, and they represent the Party and the working class in leading the enterprise. If we don’t want public representatives and let the private sector lead again, and call us to return to the capitalist road, none of us workers will agree. Zeng Shuren of Sanyi Printing Factory said: Our factory lost more than 20,000 yuan before the joint venture. After the joint venture, the public representative led us to engage in production. The enthusiasm and creativity of our workers were greatly brought into play. What used to be done by four people is now done by three. Since the second quarter of last year, our factory has overfulfilled its tasks every quarter. Not only have we received rewards, but we have also had a surplus of more than 40,000 yuan for the whole year. He asked, "Without the leadership of public representatives, could this be achieved?" Xu Hegen of the Railway Bureau's Electrical Affairs Section said: A few public representatives may have some shortcomings in some places after going to the factory, but that is a matter of criticism and correction. It is absolutely impossible to say that we do not want public representatives.

Veteran workers expressed their support for the Party's fixed interest policy, but disagreed with the view of a few private sector personnel who proposed a fixed interest rate of twenty years. Many veteran workers believe that "the country will build a socialist society in three five-year plans; a fixed interest rate of twenty years means that exploitation will still be preserved in socialist society." Yang Yongkang of Minfu Textile and Dyeing Factory said: "The workers in our factory and I believe that this is dragging socialism back." Chu Shiliang of Shanghai Post Office said: "Some capitalists should know the exploitative nature of fixed interest after studying. It is unreasonable for them to want a fixed interest rate for twenty years. On the contrary, this shows that they still lack the determination to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers."

There were representatives of veteran workers from more than thirty units attending this symposium. Chen Chanan of Shanghai Highway Management Office said: "If capitalists want to 'speak out,' our working class must also 'speak out.' I hope the newspaper publishes the opinions everyone talked about today, so that everyone can see which are fragrant flowers and which are poisonous weeds." His opinion was unanimously approved by the veteran workers present.

    上海老工人座谈当前人民内部矛盾
    反对撤出公方代表和定息二十年
    本报上海21日电　工人们对于目前人民内部矛盾的热烈讨论有些什么看法，上海一些老年工人昨天在上海工会联合会举行的一次老工人座谈会上发表了许多意见。
    许多老工人在发言中都说，从自己的切身体验来看，党和政府在工作中的成绩应该是主要的一面，目前报纸上充满着批评缺点的气氛，好像给人一个印象，似乎我们的工作尽是缺点，没有成绩。上海电业管理局线路管理所的陈蟾安说：现在报纸上到处是批评。批评是应当的，解决人民内部矛盾，有缺点，就批评，这是好的。但是，光批评，没有自我批评，也不好。光讲一面有点是非不清。要解决矛盾，一定要分清是非。上海铁路管理局电务段的老工人许和根说：目前有些人说党和政府管得太紧、太多，把人民的积极性都管光了。我认为这样说是不妥当的。我要说，在党和政府的领导下，我们工人阶级的积极性和创造性是大大地发挥了。新民机器厂的林惠堂说：我们厂原先是雇用几十个童工发展起来的。合营前厂里很困难，资本家一心想丢掉包袱，要求政府早点派人来管。合营后，厂里的生产飞跃发展，无论产量质量都提高很多。上海市第一建筑工程公司的潘其灼也说：我们建筑工人在旧社会里是最被人看不起的。人们叫我们“邋遢泥水臭漆匠”，我们的生活简直不像人的生活，所谓“吃咸水汤，困无脚床”，苦头吃够了。现在，我们的情况就大不同了。去年“五一”，我们建筑工人也享受了劳保条例，生老病死再也不用担忧。每年，我们为工人、学生、知识分子盖宿舍、砌学堂、造厂房，这难道不是我们党和政府领导的成绩吗！
    对有些私方人员主张从公私合营企业中撤出公方代表，老工人一致提出不同的意见。民孚染织厂的仰永康说：公方代表就是我们工人阶级的代表，是代表党和工人阶级来领导企业的。不要公方代表，还让私方来领导，叫我们再回到资本主义道路上去，那我们工人谁也不会同意的。三一印刷厂的曾树人说：我们厂合营前亏损达二万多元，合营后，公方代表领导我们搞生产，我们工人的积极性、创造性大大发挥了，从前四个人干的活，现在三个人就担当起来了。从去年第二季度起，我厂每季都超额完成任务，不但得到了奖励，全年还盈余了四万多元。他问道：“如果没有公方代表领导，能做到这样吗？”铁路局电务段许和根说：少数公方代表下厂后，可能有一些地方有缺点，但那是批评改正的问题，决不能说不要公方代表。
    老工人对党的定息政策表示拥护，但对少数私方人员提出定息二十年的看法表示不同意。不少老工人都认为：“国家三个五年计划就建成社会主义社会了；定息二十年，就是说到了社会主义社会还要保存剥削。”民孚染织厂仰永康说：“我们厂的工人和我，都认为这是拖社会主义的后腿。”上海市邮局的褚士良说：“某些资本家经过学习，应该知道定息的剥削性质。他们要定息二十年，是不合理的。相反的，这正说明他们还缺乏把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者的决心。”
    出席这次座谈会的共有三十多个单位的老年工人的代表。上海公路管理所陈蟾安说：“资本家要‘鸣’，我们工人阶级也要‘鸣’。今天大家谈的意见，希望报纸发表，让大家看看哪是鲜花，哪是毒草。”他这个意见得到到会的老工人一致的赞同。
