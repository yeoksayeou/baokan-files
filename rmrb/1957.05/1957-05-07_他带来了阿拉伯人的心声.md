    He Brought the Voice of the Arab People
    By Our Correspondent Feng Zhidan
    "We are very happy, we have come to China. The Chinese people are very good people, and they have a rich and long cultural tradition." This was the first sentence spoken by Mr. Mohammed Khair al-Din Ibrahim, head of the delegation of the Arab Confederation of Trade Unions, who came to China at the invitation of the Chinese trade unions to attend the "May Day" celebrations, when he received reporters.
    Mr. Khair al-Din comes from the land of the pyramids on the banks of the Nile, and he brings the voice of the Egyptian and Arab people. Now spring is in full bloom on the Nile, and the people on both banks are engaged in diligent peaceful labor.
    Our conversation quickly turned to the current tense situation in the Middle East. Mr. Khair al-Din said:
    "Imperialism is trying to restore its rule over Arab countries in the Middle East, and they are trying to tie Arab countries to the chariot of aggressive blocs. The so-called 'joint defense,' 'Baghdad Pact,' 'Eisenhower Doctrine,' and other terms all contain imperialist purposes. As our President Nasser once said: they are imperialism in very good disguise, but no matter what mask they wear, they are still the same as old-fashioned colonialism."
    "The Jordan incident is a good example," Mr. Khair al-Din paused for a moment, "We can see very clearly that the Jordan incident is the result of imperialist intervention. Now in Egypt, almost everyone has learned to sniff out the smell of imperialism with their noses. When the news of the dismissal of the Nabulsi cabinet came out, in our country, whether workers, farmers, or anyone else, everyone immediately knew what was going on."
    "However," Mr. Khair al-Din continued, "no matter how insidious the imperialist tricks are, we believe that the Jordanian people's desire for independence will eventually be realized. These days I have also read news that the King of Jordan and the current government have expressed their intention to follow the guidelines established by the Arab Four-Power Summit, which shows that the will of the Jordanian people cannot be ignored."
    "The Arab people have awakened, this is the most important issue." Mr. Khair al-Din easily turned his topic from the Jordan incident to the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He said: "The Arab people do not want the 'Eisenhower Doctrine,' and a large number of Arab newspapers and radio stations are issuing calls against the Eisenhower Doctrine every day."
    Speaking of this, Mr. Khair al-Din gave an example. The Secretary-General of the Arab Confederation of Trade Unions, Kamel, recently wrote a book called "Oh, No, Eisenhower!" This book shows that the Arab people, the Arab workers, do not want the stinking "Eisenhower Doctrine." Mr. Khair al-Din said that he did not remember the detailed content of the book, but from a cartoon printed on the cover of the book, one could know everything that the author wanted to explain. The picture shows an old truck loaded with broken bottles, broken cans, old shoes, smelly socks, faded clothes... The peddler pushing the cart is selling these collected old goods along the street, but few people are interested. The old junk dealer in this cartoon is US President Eisenhower. Mr. Khair al-Din said with a smile: "This cartoon shows that people have long thrown away the tattered colonialism, and no one wants any 'doctrine' peddled by Eisenhower!"
    Speaking of the struggle for the Suez Canal, Mr. Khair al-Din said: "The just struggle of the Egyptian people has won a major victory, and this victory is also of great significance to the anti-colonialist cause around the world. But our struggle against imperialism is not over, and the Egyptian people remain vigilant today to defeat the conspiracies of imperialism at any time."
    Indeed, the Egyptian people's defense of the sovereignty of the Suez Canal was a great struggle, and their heroic deeds will constitute a glorious page to be recorded by historians of later generations. At the same time, from this great struggle, people can draw many valuable experiences and lessons. Mr. Khair al-Din especially emphasized the unity of the Arab peoples and the Arab workers in the common struggle against imperialism. He said that in the struggle for the Suez Canal, Arab workers demonstrated this noble spirit of unity. Workers in Syria, workers in Jordan, and workers in Kuwait all took action to prevent oil from flowing to the West. Workers at Khartoum Airport banned the landing of British and French aircraft.
    People clearly remember what happened on August 16, 1956, when workers from Arab countries showed great solidarity. This was the opening day of the first London Conference, when the US, British and French imperialists launched an international conspiracy to seize the Suez Canal. On this day, demonstrations in support of Egypt broke out in the capitals of Arab countries to show the power of the unity of the Arab people. In Tripoli, workers demonstrated in the streets in support of their Egyptian brothers. In Amman, people held up large flags and shouted slogans against imperialism. In Damascus, thousands of Syrians demonstrated and observed a five-minute silence to mourn the "freedom strangled by the London Conference"! Around Algiers, Algerian heroic guerrillas launched seven attacks against the French colonial army in the 48 hours before and after August 16th...
    Unity, in the face of their common enemy - colonialism, the Arab peoples today need to strengthen and cherish their unity a hundredfold, which is the conclusion that can be drawn from Mr. Khair al-Din's conversation.
    The scheduled time has arrived. Before parting, Mr. Khair al-Din said:
    "We wish the Chinese people a victorious realization of the first and second five-year plans. We have seen the bright future of the Chinese people from the 'May Day' celebrations."

    他带来了阿拉伯人的心声
    本报记者  冯之丹
    “我们非常高兴，我们到了中国。中国人民是很好的人民，他们有着丰富和久远的文化传统。”这是应中国工会的邀请前来我国参加“五一”观礼的阿拉伯国际工会联合会代表团团长穆罕默德·海尔米·伊布拉罕在接见记者时的第一句话。
    海尔米先生来自尼罗河畔金字塔的国度，他带来了埃及和阿拉伯人民的心声。现在尼罗河上春意正浓，两岸的人们正在从事着辛勤的和平劳动。
    我们的谈话很快就转到目前中东的紧张局势。海尔米先生说：
    “帝国主义正在中东企图恢复它们对阿拉伯国家的统治，它们力图把阿拉伯各国绑到侵略集团的战车上去。所谓‘共同防御’‘巴格达条约’‘艾森豪威尔主义’等等这些名词，都包含着帝国主义目的。正如我们的纳赛尔总统曾经说过的：它们是伪装得很好的帝国主义，但是不论它们戴着什么面具，它们仍然是同老牌的殖民主义一模一样的。”
    “约旦事件就是一个很好的例子，”海尔米先生停顿了一下，“我们看得很清楚，约旦事件是帝国主义干涉的结果。现在在埃及，差不多人人都已经学会用鼻子嗅出帝国主义的气味来了。当纳布西内阁被解职的消息一传出，在我们的国家，无论是工人，农民，任何人都立刻知道这是怎么一回事。”
    “但是，”海尔米先生继续说：“不论帝国主义的诡计是如何阴险，我们相信，约旦人民的独立愿望终究是要实现的。这几天我还读到这样的消息，约旦国王和现政府都表示要遵行阿拉伯四国首脑会议所确立的方针，这说明约旦人民的意志是不能忽视的。”
    “阿拉伯人民觉醒起来了，这是最最重要的问题。”海尔米先生把他的话题从约旦事件很容易地转到了“艾森豪威尔主义”。他说：“阿拉伯人民不要‘艾森豪威尔主义’，阿拉伯各国的大量的书报和电台，每天都在发出反对艾森豪威尔主义的呼声。”
    说到这里，海尔米先生举了一个例子。阿拉伯国际工会联合会的总书记卡迈勒最近就写了一本书，名字叫做“噢，不，艾森豪威尔！”这本书表明了阿拉伯人民、阿拉伯的劳动者不要臭气横溢的“艾森豪威尔主义”。海尔米先生说，他不记得这本书的详细内容了，但是从这本书的封面上印着的一张漫画便能够知道作者所要说明的一切。画上有一辆载着破瓶、破罐、旧皮鞋、臭袜子、褪了色的衣衫……的旧货车。推车的小贩把这些收罗来的旧货沿街叫卖，但很少有人问津。这张漫画上的旧货贩子就是美国总统艾森豪威尔。海尔米先生笑着说：“这张漫画说明，人们早就把破烂的殖民主义给扔掉了，谁都不要艾森豪威尔贩卖的什么‘主义’！”
    在谈到苏伊士运河的斗争时，海尔米先生说：“埃及人民的正义斗争已经获得了重大的胜利，这个胜利对于全世界反殖民主义的事业也是有很大的意义的。但是我们反对帝国主义的斗争还没有结束，埃及人民今天仍然保持着警惕，以随时击败帝国主义的阴谋诡计。”
    的确，埃及人民保卫苏伊士运河的主权是一场伟大的斗争，他们的英勇的事迹将要构成后代的历史家们所要记述的光辉的一页。同时，从这个伟大的斗争中，人们是可以吸取许多宝贵的经验教训的。海尔米先生特别强调阿拉伯各国人民和阿拉伯各国工人在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中的团结一致。他说，在苏伊士运河的斗争中，阿拉伯各国工人表现了这种团结的高贵的精神。叙利亚的工人、约旦的工人、科威特的工人都曾行动起来，阻止石油流向西方。喀土穆机场上的工人禁止英法飞机的降落。
    人们清楚地记得1956年8月16日所发生的事情，阿拉伯各国工人表现了伟大的团结。这是美、英、法帝国主义发动夺取苏伊士运河国际阴谋的第一次伦敦会议开幕的日子。就在这一天，阿拉伯各国首都爆发了声援埃及的示威游行，以显示阿拉伯人民的团结的威力。在的黎波里，工人们在街头示威声援他们的埃及兄弟。在安曼，人们举着大旗，高呼反对帝国主义的口号。在大马士革，数以千计的叙利亚人举行示威，并作了五分钟的默念以悼念“伦敦会议所扼杀的自由”！在阿尔及尔的周围，阿尔及利亚的英勇的游击健儿在8月16日前后的48小时内向法国殖民军发动了七次进攻……。
    团结，在他们的共同敌人——殖民主义面前，阿拉伯各国人民今天需要百倍地加强和珍视他们的团结，这就是从海尔米先生谈话中所能得出的结论。
    预定的时间已经到了。临别时，海尔米先生说：
    “我们祝福中国人民胜利地实现第一个和第二个五年计划。我们已经从‘五一’节的庆典中看到了中国人民光辉的未来。”
