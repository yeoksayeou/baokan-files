Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 14th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti pointed out at the closing meeting of the Italian Communist Party Southern Regions Committee Representative Meeting held in Naples on May 13th that the real reason for the current Italian government crisis lies in the fact that the Segni government, like other governments since the 1953 parliamentary elections, is unable to solve the most pressing domestic political, economic, and social problems, nor can it implement a foreign policy that conforms to Italy's interests.

He said that Communists should mobilize their strength and awaken all democratic strata to oppose the political dictatorship of the Christian Democratic Party. Togliatti proposed some main tasks for the moment: industrial institutions must be reformed according to the constitution; land reform must be implemented and the economic problems of Southern Italy and the islands must be solved; state institutions must be democratized and everything stipulated in the constitution must be strictly implemented; the policy aimed at easing international tension, disarmament, and peaceful relations must be restored, and economic cooperation and mutual understanding between countries, especially the major powers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, must be restored; Italy should demand that all countries stop testing atomic weapons and not establish military bases on our territory that could be used by foreign countries. Italy should refuse to equip the Italian army with atomic and thermonuclear weapons.

Togliatti then pointed out that the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Social Democratic Party had decided to merge. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party deepened the division of the workers' movement on an anti-communist basis. Togliatti emphasized that if the Socialist Party refuses to cooperate with the Communist Party and a split occurs, it will bring losses to the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, and the entire workers' movement and democratic movement.

The Communist Party Southern Regions Committee Representative Meeting opened on May 11th. More than 900 people attended the meeting, including party representatives from Rome, Milan, Turin, Bologna, Venice, and Florence. Many members of the Central Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Italian Communist Party also attended the meeting.

Giorgio Amendola, a member of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee, made a report on the 12th entitled "Communists Fight for the Revival of Southern Italy." He mentioned that the only correct principle for solving the serious economic and social problems of the underdeveloped regions of Southern Italy is for the working class of Northern Italy and the residents of Southern Italy to form an alliance in the struggle against the common enemies—big business owners and big landlords.

The representatives attending the meeting discussed the economic, social, and political situation in the southern regions, and formulated plans to strive for land reform and industrialization in the south, and to improve the living standards of the masses in the south.

    在意共南部地区党委代表会议上
    陶里亚蒂号召唤醒民主阶层反对政治独裁
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂5月13日在那不勒斯举行的意大利南部各区共产党委员会代表会议闭幕会议上指出，目前意大利政府危机的真正原因在于塞尼政府像1953年议会选举后的其他历届政府一样，没有能力解决国内最迫切的政治、经济和社会问题，也不能实行符合意大利利益的外交政策。
    他说，共产党员应该动员自己的力量，唤醒一切民主阶层，反对天主教民主党的政治独裁。陶里亚蒂提出当前的一些主要任务是：必须根据宪法改革工业机构；实行土地改革和解决南意大利以及各岛屿的经济问题；必须使国家机构民主化，严格实施宪法所规定的一切；必须恢复旨在缓和国际紧张局势、裁军、和平关系的政策，恢复各国间、首先是美国、英国、法国和苏联几个大国间的经济合作和相互了解；意大利应该要求一切国家停止试验原子武器，不要在我国领土上建立可能被外国利用的军事基地。意大利应该拒绝用原子武器和热核武器装备意大利军队。
    陶里亚蒂接着指出，意大利社会党和意大利社会民主党曾经决定要合并。可是社会民主党的领导人却在反共的基础上加深工人运动的分裂。陶里亚蒂强调说，如果社会党拒绝同共产党合作而产生了分裂，这对意大利共产党、对意大利社会党以及整个工人运动和民主运动都会带来损失。
    共产党南部各区委员会代表会议是在5月11日开幕的。参加会议的九百多人中有来自罗马、米兰、都灵、波伦亚、威尼斯和佛罗伦萨等地的党代表。意大利共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会的许多委员也出席了会议。
    意共中央书记处委员乔治·阿门多拉在12日的会议上作了题为“共产党员为复兴南意大利而斗争”的报告。他提到解决意大利南部不大发达地区严重的经济问题和社会问题的唯一正确的原则就是要意大利北部的工人阶级和意大利南部的居民在反对共同的敌人——大企业主和大地主的斗争中结成联盟。
    参加会议的代表们讨论了南部地区的经济、社会和政治情况问题，并且拟定了争取在南部实行土地改革和工业化以及提高南部人民群众生活水平的计划。
