    Rescue the Electrodes!
    In 1950, our China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company's Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station imported more than 2,000 tons of graphite electrodes and carbon electrodes from Poland, worth 3.34 million yuan. Now, these electrodes are suffocating in the warehouse, and are about to deteriorate.
    Last November, we sent a letter to the State Council through the People's Daily, requesting a solution to the backlog problem. The General Office of the State Council forwarded the letter to the State Economic Commission, the State Economic Commission forwarded it to the Fifth Office of the State Council, the Fifth Office forwarded it to the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce forwarded it to the Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, and this company forwarded it back to the State Council. The State Council then approved and forwarded it to the State Economic Commission, and the State Economic Commission approved and forwarded it to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry then forwarded it back to the State Economic Commission. After all this back and forth, the State Economic Commission finally convened a meeting of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Commerce in February of this year to discuss the matter jointly, but the discussion remained inconclusive. Later, we found Director Cao of the Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and he proposed three solutions: First, because the supply plan for this year has already been set, we'll talk about it next year; second, the State Economic Commission should use administrative orders to allocate them to various ministries; third, the Ministry of Commerce should sell them to various ministries on credit. After research by the Ministry of Commerce and the Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, it was considered that the first and third solutions were not feasible. After research with the State Economic Commission, the Commission also believed that it was not appropriate to use administrative orders to solve the problem. So how exactly should it be solved? Who will take responsibility and come up with a solution? According to the supply station's inspection, in the past period, seventy tons of carbon electrodes have already been completely scrapped, and the rest are also on the verge of perishing. Is this property really going to be completely scrapped? Please, Economic Commission, find a way to rescue this property!

    抢救电极！
    1950年，我们中国交通电业器材公司天津采购供应站从波兰进口了两千多吨石墨电极和炭精电极，价值三百三十四万元。现在，这电极闷在仓库里，马上就要变质了。
    去年11月，我们经过人民日报转给国务院一封信，请求解决积压问题。国务院办公厅将信转给国家经济委员会，国家经济委员会又转给国务院第五办公室，第五办公室又将信转给商业部，商业部又转给交通电业器材公司，这个公司又转回给国务院，国务院又批转国家经济委员会，国家经济委员会批转冶金部，冶金部又转回国家经济委员会。转来转去，到今年2月份，国家经济委员会才召集冶金部和商业部开会，共同商议，但是，仍然是议而不决。后来我们找到冶金部销售局曹局长，他提出了三个处理方案：一、因为今年供应计划已定，明年再说；二、由国家经济委员会用行政命令分配给各部；三、由商业部赊销给各部使用。经商业部和交通电业器材公司研究，认为一、三两个方案行不通；同经委研究，经委又认为不宜用行政命令方法解决。究竟怎么解决呢？谁来负个责任，想个办法呢？据供应站检查，在过去这一段时间里，已经有七十吨炭精电极完全报废了，其余的也命在旦夕。难道真的要这笔财产完全报废吗？请经济委员会设法抢救这笔财产吧！
