Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 1st: Cairo newspapers on April 30th published detailed summaries of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the Jordan issue on April 29th. Many newspapers pointed out that the Soviet statement was a serious warning to the United States and other Western countries, as well as to the aggressive blocs of Israel and Iraq, which threatened the territorial integrity and independence of Jordan.

The newspapers also emphasized the Soviet Union's desire to ensure peace and security in the Middle East and focused on the Soviet Union's proposal that the four major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, jointly issue a statement of non-interference in the internal affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries.

"Al Shaab" published the Soviet statement under a prominent headline. The newspaper said: "The statements by the US authorities against the Arab liberation front, their open incitement of the reactionary forces in Jordan, the provision of aid to Jordan, and the threatening deployment of the Sixth Fleet, all expose the imperialists' determination to destroy this front."

"Al Shaab" pointed out: The Arab people are fully determined to fight for their complete liberation and defend their freedom and independence.

"Al Gomhuria" wrote in an editorial that the cause of the current tension in the Near and Middle East is the interference of Western countries in the internal affairs of the countries in this region. The newspaper said, "If the West does not disturb the Arab East, then this region will be filled with an atmosphere of peace and tranquility."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 2nd: Hussein Fahmy, editor-in-chief of "Al Shaab" and chairman of the Egyptian Journalists Association, said in an article entitled "Lessons from the Jordan Incident" that the purpose of the imperialists' conspiracy in Jordan was to: attack Arab nationalism, suppress the Arab countries' desire for freedom, and force them to form alliances with the West.

Fahmy wrote that all Arabs now see that, under the pretext of "fighting communism," all patriotic people in Jordan who yearn for true Arab unity and defend a policy of positive neutrality are being arrested. All Arabs now see that the United States is providing "US aid" as a reward for suppressing the Jordanian national liberation forces.

Fahmy pointed out that the basis of the US conspiracy is to organize internal coups in free Arab countries to extinguish the liberation movement and eliminate the policy of positive neutrality in the Middle East and Africa.

Hussain Heikal, editor-in-chief of "Akher Sa'a" magazine, pointed out in an article published in this magazine on May 1st that the United States is trying to pave the way for Jordan to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine.

Heikal said: "It is natural to ask, what kind of doctrine is being promoted through putting the entire Jordanian nation in prison, destroying the unity of the Jordanian army, declaring martial law in Jordan, imposing a curfew in Jordan, throwing thousands of hostages into prison, and expelling all nationalist ideas from Jordan?"

Heikal said that the US inside men in Jordan are "some men and women in the court who sell their rights, rely on whoever pays them, and even sell drugs without hesitation."

    埃报欢迎苏联关于约旦问题声明
    指责美帝国主义制造中东紧张局势
    新华社开罗1日电  开罗各报4月30日刊载了苏联外交部4月29日关于约旦问题的声明的详细摘要。许多报纸指出，苏联的声明对美国和其他西方国家，以及对威胁约旦领土的完整和独立的以色列和伊拉克的侵略集团是一个严重的警告。
    各报还强调指出苏联对保障中东和平和安全的愿望，并且着重报道了苏联曾经建议苏、美、英、法四大国共同发表不干涉中近东国家内政的声明。
    “人民报”在头号标题下刊载了苏联声明。这家报纸说：“美国当局反对阿拉伯解放阵线的声明、它们对约旦反动势力的公开煽动、向约旦提供援助、威胁性地调动第六舰队，这一切暴露了帝国主义破坏这个阵线的决心。”
    “人民报”指出：阿拉伯人民有充分的决心来争取自己的完全解放和保卫自己的自由和独立。
    “共和国报”在社论中写道，造成中近东目前紧张局面的原因，是西方国家干涉这个地区的国家的内政。这家报纸说，“如果西方不来打扰阿拉伯东方，那么这个地区就会充满和平和安宁的气氛。”
    新华社开罗2日电  “人民报”总编辑和埃及新闻工作者协会主席侯赛尼·法米在一篇题为“约旦事件的教训”的文章中说，帝国主义者在约旦制造阴谋的目的是：打击阿拉伯人的民族主义，压制阿拉伯国家要求自由的意愿，迫使它们同西方结成联盟。
    法米写道，全体阿拉伯人现在看到，在“同共产主义作斗争”的借口下，约旦国内一切渴望真正的阿拉伯团结和捍卫积极中立政策的爱国人士遭到逮捕。全体阿拉伯人现在都看到，美国提供“美援”作为镇压约旦民族解放力量的报酬。
    法米指出，美国阴谋的基础是在自由的阿拉伯国家组织国内政变，以扑灭解放运动，铲除中东和非洲的积极中立政策。
    “最后一点钟”周刊主编侯赛尼·海卡尔5月1日在这家周刊上发表的一篇文章中指出，美国正在设法给约旦铺平接受艾森豪威尔主义的道路。
    海卡尔说：“自然要问，这个用置整个约旦民族于囹圄、破坏约旦军队团结、宣布约旦戒严、在约旦实行宵禁、把成千上万的人质投入监狱、把一切民族主义观念驱逐出约旦这种种勾当来准备推行的主义是一种什么主义呢？”
    海卡尔说，美国在约旦的内应是“宫廷中一些出卖利权，谁出钱就投靠谁，甚至就是贩卖毒品也在所不惜的男女”。
