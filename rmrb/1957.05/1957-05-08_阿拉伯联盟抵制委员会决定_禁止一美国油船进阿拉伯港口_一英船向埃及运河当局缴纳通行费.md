    Arab League Boycott Committee Decides
    To Ban American Oil Tanker from Arab Ports
    British Ship Pays Toll to Egyptian Suez Canal Authority
    (Via this newspaper's report) Damascus news: The Arab League Boycott Committee decided on the 6th to boycott the American oil tanker "Kern Hills." According to this decision, this 10,441-ton oil tanker will be prohibited from entering the ports of all Arab countries.
    It is reported that this decision will be urgently notified to the governments of nine Arab League countries: Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Sudan, and Libya.
    On April 6th, the "Kern Hills" transported Iranian oil through the Strait of Tiran to the Israeli port of Eilat.
    Various Arab countries have separately protested to the United States. The Iranian government has also stated its decision to prohibit the sale and transportation of Iranian-controlled oil (accounting for 12.5% of total production) to Israel. However, the United States has consistently ignored the protests from Arab countries. According to an Amman dispatch from the Associated Press, a second American oil tanker, having loaded oil from Abadan, Iran, arrived in Eilat at midnight on May 4th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 7th: The British ship "Maria Victoria" passed through the Suez Canal on the 6th after paying the canal tolls to the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority. This British ship had been staying in Port Suez since April 2nd, awaiting instructions from the London shipping company regarding the payment of tolls.
    May 6th was the day with the most ships passing through the canal since its reopening, with twenty-four ships from thirteen countries passing through the canal on this day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo: Cairo Radio reported that thirteen ships, including two American ships, passed through the Suez Canal on May 3rd.
    The radio station said that some American shipping companies that have recently used the canal have notified the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority through their agents in Egypt that they will pay canal tolls without any reservations.
    The head of the United Nations' assistance in clearing the canal, former American Lieutenant General Wheeler, said before leaving Egypt to return to the United States on May 3rd: "Egyptians are technically capable of handling everything related to the operation of the canal. I hope Egypt manages the canal successfully, satisfying everyone."
    Wheeler also said, "I am certain that Egypt is eager to maintain the full and normal navigation of the Suez Canal."

    阿拉伯联盟抵制委员会决定
    禁止一美国油船进阿拉伯港口
    一英船向埃及运河当局缴纳通行费
    本报讯　大马士革消息：阿拉伯联盟抵制委员会6日决定，对美国油船“克恩·希尔斯号”进行抵制。根据这一决定，这艘一万零四百四十一吨的油船将被禁止进入一切阿拉伯国家的港口。
    据讯，这个决定将紧急通知叙利亚、埃及、黎巴嫩、约旦、沙特阿拉伯、也门、伊拉克、苏丹和利比亚九个阿拉伯联盟国家的政府。
    上月6日，“克恩·希尔斯号”曾经运载伊朗石油，通过蒂朗海峡进入以色列埃拉特港。
    各个阿拉伯国家曾分别向美国提出抗议。伊朗政府也曾表示决定禁止出售和运送伊朗本国所控制的石油（占总产量12.5％）给以色列。但是，美国对阿拉伯国家的抗议，一直采取不理的态度。据美联社安曼消息，第二艘美国油船已在5月4日午夜从伊朗的阿巴丹载运石油开抵埃拉特。
    新华社开罗7日电　英国轮船“玛丽亚·维多利亚”号在向埃及苏伊士运河当局缴纳了运河通行费后已经在6日通过运河。这艘英国船因为等待伦敦轮船总公司关于缴纳通行费的指令，从4月2日起就停留在苏伊士港内。
    5月6日是运河恢复通航以来通过船只最多的一天，包括十三个国家的二十四艘轮船在这一天通过了运河。
    据新华社开罗电　开罗电台报道，包括两艘美国船在内的十三艘船只在5月3日通过了苏伊士运河。
    电台说，最近使用了运河的一些美国航运公司已经通过它们在埃及的代理人通知埃及苏伊士运河当局：它们将缴纳运河通行费而不作任何保留。
    联合国协助清理运河的负责人、美国前中将惠勒5月3日在离开埃及回美国的前夕发表谈话说：“埃及人在技术方面有能力处理一切有关运河经营的事情。我希望埃及经营运河成功，使人人都满意。”
    惠勒还说，“我确信埃及是急于保持苏伊士运河的充分而正常的通航的。”
