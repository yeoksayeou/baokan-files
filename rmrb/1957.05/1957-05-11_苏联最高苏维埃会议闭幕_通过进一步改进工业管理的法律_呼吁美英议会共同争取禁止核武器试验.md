(Dispatch from our newspaper in Moscow, May 10th) The Soviet Supreme Soviet session closed today after a joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. At the meeting, the Chairman of the Council of the Union, Lobanov, read a congratulatory telegram from the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic. The telegram stated: The Hungarian people warmly thank the Communist Party, government, and people of the Soviet Union for their selfless assistance in quelling the counter-revolution, support the Soviet Union's proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing, and will strengthen the ties of the entire socialist camp in the future, carrying the cause of socialist construction to victory, and wish the Soviet Supreme Soviet session a successful outcome.

Today, discussions were concluded after speeches by thirty-two representatives. Khrushchev made a concluding speech. He said that the discussion showed that the representatives unanimously approved the draft law proposed by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government; speakers unanimously stated that the reorganization of industrial management would cause a surge in production and achieve new achievements; many suggestions from the representatives have been reflected in the draft, and other suggestions should be carefully studied by the Council of Ministers and the State Planning Commission, border regions, and state organizations.

Subsequently, the two houses separately passed the law on further improving the organizational work of managing industry and construction by a show of hands, and unanimously passed the law on constitutional changes related to this. At this time, thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue. Subsequently, the meeting approved some decrees promulgated recently.

Then, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the meeting about the Soviet government's efforts to stop nuclear weapons testing. Gromyko said that the Soviet government has consistently adhered to the position that atomic and hydrogen weapons must be completely and unconditionally prohibited, and that such weapons must be eliminated from armaments. The Soviet government hopes that the United States and the United Kingdom will change their current attitude and first conclude an agreement on stopping the testing of such weapons. Then, representatives Korneichuk, Ellison, Omanova, and Popova spoke in support of the government's measures in this regard. The meeting passed a resolution supporting the government's policies and measures in this regard. The meeting decided to send letters to the United States Congress and the British Parliament, calling for a ban on nuclear weapons testing. Finally, a reply telegram to the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic was read at the meeting. The telegram stated that the victory and achievements of the Hungarian people are an important guarantee for world peace.
