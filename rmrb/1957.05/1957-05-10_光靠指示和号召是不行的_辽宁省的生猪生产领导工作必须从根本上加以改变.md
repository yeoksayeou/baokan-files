Mere Instructions and Appeals Are Not Enough
The Leadership of Liaoning Province's Hog Production Must Be Fundamentally Changed
By Our Reporter Lu Hao

Originally, there was generally enough pork to eat; but now, many people in Shenyang and other places have not been able to eat pork for more than half a year.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, in Shenyang City, except for hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, the catering industry, and certain units or individuals who must be supplied with pork who can usually get some pork allocated, pork has not been available for purchase in stores selling pork throughout the city for a long time. Not only is this the case in Shenyang, but in cities such as Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin, and Jinzhou in Liaoning Province, many people have not been able to eat pork for several months in a row.

Some people say that the reason why pork supply is particularly tight in Liaoning Province compared to other provinces is mainly because there are too many large and medium-sized cities with concentrated industry and mining in the province, so the province's rural hog production cannot meet the needs of so many cities. Therefore, some people say: If you want to meet the pork supply needs of these cities, unless the central government allocates some pork from other places, it will be difficult to improve the situation. What is the actual situation? Not to mention the distant past, just taking 1955 as an example, the province raised 3.91 million hogs, and the number of hogs purchased was 1,037,000. In addition, 262,900 hogs were shipped out of the province. This means that not only was the province generally self-sufficient, but it could also export. In 1956, the number of hogs raised in the province dropped to 3.37 million, but the number of hogs purchased still maintained 1.03 million, and 103,800 hogs were shipped out of the province in the first half of the year. However, by February of this year, the province had only 2.95 million hogs, and the annual purchase of hogs decreased to 800,000. In order to take care of the pork supply for the people of Liaoning Province, the central government decided this year to allocate 141,600 hogs to Liaoning from Inner Mongolia, Henan, and other places. Even so, it seems that the tense situation of pork supply will still not be alleviated. It can be seen that Liaoning Province originally had generally enough pork to eat, but now it cannot be eaten mainly because the production of hogs has declined, the number of hogs purchased by the state has decreased, and the people's need for pork supply has been increasing day by day, so the contradiction appears particularly acute.

According to statistics from the commercial departments of Liaoning Province, there are currently 2.95 million hogs in the province, a decrease of 27.9% compared to 1952 and a decrease of 12.4% compared to 1956. According to the plan of the Provincial People's Committee, the province originally planned to purchase 1.15 million head of fattened hogs this year. Later, after consultation with various parties, it was changed to 1.1 million. By January of this year, it was finally decided to purchase 900,000. However, the current Urban Service Hall believes that it is not very confident to purchase 800,000 this year. The Provincial Food Company, which is directly engaged in hog purchasing, originally estimated that it could only purchase 650,000. After repeated calculations at the recent city and county manager meetings, it was also believed that it could only purchase 750,000. Even with the purchase of 750,000, many county food companies still believe that it is difficult to complete the task. In this way, people cannot help but ask with concern: Why has the hog production in Liaoning Province been declining year by year? What difficulties are there in the hog production itself?

There are many factors that dampen farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, but not much work has been done to specifically help farmers solve the difficulties in raising pigs.

Judging from the hog raising situation in Liaoning Province, the difficulties in hog production are multifaceted. In various regions, the reasons and extent of the difficulties are not entirely the same. For example, the lack of pig feed in some areas is one of the serious difficulties hindering the development of hog production, especially in areas with special crops and areas with poor harvests. Many places adopted the method of "retaining grain upon seeing pigs" in September last year, that is, retaining 100 catties of grain for each pig; but for piglets raised after September, there was no way to solve the feed problem. Pig diseases are rampant in Liaoning Province, so the mortality rate of pigs is also very high, which is also a big threat to farmers raising pigs. According to the Provincial Bureau of Statistics' survey of farmers' household accounts in eight spots, it is estimated that the mortality rate of pigs accounted for 23.1% of the total number of pigs raised in 1956. The work style of some hog purchasing staff being divorced from the masses has also brought adverse effects to hog production to a certain extent. Some places are very picky when purchasing fattened hogs. A provincial governor asked the county party secretary of Liaoyang County: "Why can't you purchase your pigs?" The county party secretary sighed and said: "Governor! The food company's purchasing staff have more difficulty buying pigs than picking a lover!" The farmers' resentment can be imagined.

Another important reason for the slow development of hog production in Liaoning Province is the lack of pig sources. At the end of 1956, there were only 370,000 to 380,000 sows in the province. If each sow produces 15 piglets, the province can produce 5.7 million piglets throughout the year. After deducting 25% of the piglet mortality rate, plus the number of fattened pigs throughout the year, there are only 4.65 million hogs, which is more than 800,000 hogs short of the province's plan to raise 5.5 million hogs. The small number of sows has resulted in the current shortage of piglets. Since the central government instructed all localities to increase the purchase and sale prices of hogs, farmers can earn about 10 to 20 yuan per pig, which is of great benefit to encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs; but what deserves attention now is that the price of piglets in some places has already doubled. As a result of the high price of piglets, farmers will naturally relatively reduce the real benefits of increased hog prices, which is of course also unfavorable to the development of hog production. In short, looking at the overall situation, in the past period of time, there have been many factors that have dampened farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs. As for how to specifically lead and help farmers solve the difficulties in raising pigs, although Liaoning Province has also done a lot of work, it is still not enough compared to the arduous task of raising 5.5 million hogs this year.

Although the development of hog production has attracted the attention of the leadership, the relevant person in charge still has no idea about it

Since the second half of last year, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have begun to pay attention to the issue of developing hog production. In order to support the development of hog production, not long ago, the province's leading organs resolutely allocated 20,000 tons of grain and 50,000 catties of bran originally intended for making liquor as pig feed. Especially since the central government issued the decision on developing hog production and increasing the purchase and sale prices of pork, from the overall trend, farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs has increased. Despite the high price of piglets, farmers are still vying to buy them, and the number of pigs raised is developing day by day. The number of hogs purchased recently has also increased somewhat, and the purchase number in March has more than doubled compared to the previous two months. Despite this, the distance between the development of hog production and the needs of the people has not been significantly shortened. Of course, the development of hog production requires a certain process. It takes about thirteen months for a piglet to grow into a fattened hog. People cannot expect such a thing as hog production to achieve great success in a very short period of time. However, the abnormal situation of pork supply has continued for more than half a year, and people cannot help but ask with concern: When will the development of hog production make the supply of pork tend to be normal? When will the situation that people have not been able to eat pork for a long time be changed?

Here, no relevant person in charge can give a relatively close and affirmative answer to this question. People just say vaguely: Hog production is developing, the number of purchases is increasing, and it may be better in the fourth quarter of this year. Will it definitely be better than now in the fourth quarter of this year? People shook their heads and said: I really have no idea about this. This is the crux of the problem.

The Agricultural Department of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee is the leading department responsible for the daily work of hog production, but there are only three people in this department specifically responsible for hog work, and at one time there was even only one person, which is actually difficult to shoulder the current heavy task of hog production. The Grain Department is in charge of pig feed, but because it is not clear about the specific situation of hog production, as a result, some cities and counties have allocated a lot of feed, but there are very few pigs there; some cities and counties that are indeed very short of feed cannot get feed in time. The commercial departments only manage the purchase of hogs, and of course they cannot manage raising pigs, so they naturally know very little about the hog production situation. These departments of the provincial-level organs rarely contact each other on the issue of hog production on a regular basis, and they also lack frequent joint research. They have their own systems, perform their own duties, and the cooperation between them is very poor. When it comes to the county level, this situation becomes even more serious. Many counties, on the surface, have issued instructions and held meetings, but in reality, there are many appeals and few concrete actions. The issue of hog production has not been regularly put on the agenda of the county-level leading organs, and it is only handed over to the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau to manage, but the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau often gives full power to the livestock husbandry section, which has a small number of people and weak strength. In many counties, hog production is basically still left to its own devices. From the county to the district, from the district to the township, and even to the agricultural cooperatives, what measures should be taken to ensure how many pigs are raised? What specific difficulties are there for those who are already raising pigs and those who are preparing to raise pigs? How can problems such as feed, piglets, pig sources, and the prevention and control of pig diseases be specifically and gradually resolved? How can agricultural cooperatives help pig farmers solve specific difficulties in terms of manure prices, pen lining, and pulling soil? These questions are still rarely studied and considered as a whole. As everyone knows, our hog production is based on the principle of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance." If there is a lack of concrete and strong "public assistance," "private ownership and private raising" becomes very difficult to "have" and also very difficult to "raise."

Because of the lack of specific leadership, the situation is not good even in areas where the difficulties in hog production are less.

Due to the lack of specific leadership, even if the difficulties in hog production are less in some areas, the current situation is not good. Liaoning Province had a bumper harvest for the sixth consecutive year last year, and most areas harvested more grain than in previous years. For example, Xinmin County, where every agricultural cooperative has surplus grain, purchased 41,337 fattened hogs last year, and this year it is estimated that it can only purchase 30,000. This is more than a quarter less than last year. Tai'an County, where only six agricultural cooperatives lack grain, purchased 7,060 hogs in the first quarter of last year, but only purchased more than 1,500 hogs in the same period this year. Some members of agricultural cooperatives received a lot of grain last year because of the bumper harvest, such as the Baiqi District and Dabu District of Fengcheng County, where each person received 700 to 1,000 catties of grain. There is a lot of grain, and it should be said that there is no shortage of pig feed, but the number of pigs raised is still lower than last year. For example, Dabu District raised 15,728 hogs last year, but now there are only 6,455 hogs. In Renmin Township, which has 768 households in the county, farmers received an extra 180,000 catties of grain this year, but the current number of pigs raised is only 65% of last year. It can be seen that if hog raising lacks leadership, even if the feed is sufficient, hog production will still lag behind. The serious pig diseases certainly affect farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, but if there is a lack of leadership, even in places where the diseases are relatively mild, the situation of hog production is not satisfactory. Fuxian, Xinjin, Gaiping, and Jin County are the joint prevention zone for the prevention of pig diseases in Liaoning Province, where the incidence of pig diseases is decreasing year by year. For example, pig diseases in Xinjin County in 1956 decreased by 66.6% compared to 1955. The pig diseases have decreased, but the number of pigs raised has not increased as a result. According to a census by the commercial departments of the county, Xinjin had 69,665 hogs in June last year, but the number of pigs in February this year dropped to 52,261. This year is down 24.9% from last year. The lack of pig sources and the shortage of piglets have not been given unified consideration and deployment until now. A material from the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics said that according to the breeding of piglets by the sows that can reproduce in the province, by the end of 1957, there will be a shortage of 810,000 hogs from the annual hog raising plan. Increasing 810,000 hogs is such a huge task that it is necessary to strive to breed 1.08 million piglets this year (according to the 25% mortality rate of piglets, only 810,000 will actually survive). To breed 1.08 million piglets, it is necessary to add 220,000 sows. That is to say, if you want to complete the plan to develop 5.5 million hogs by the end of 1957, you must keep 220,000 small sows in the first quarter of this year. It should be said that the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics has calculated this account very scientifically, and it has provided important opinions for carrying out the province's hog production. But now the first quarter has passed, and you want to know how many small sows have been kept more now? What difficulties are there in keeping these extra small sows? No department or person in the province can specifically tell you these situations.

Only by organizing the existing forces into a strong team can the situation of hog production fundamentally improve.

Is the lack of leadership in hog production in Liaoning Province because there are no forces to rely on in this regard? No. There is power, but it is dispersed, and the power has not been organized and used effectively. For example, the Liaoning Provincial Food Company has its own staff in various counties, districts, and townships, and there are a total of more than 4,400 staff members in the food company throughout the province. However, currently only 800 pigs are purchased a day, with an average of six people purchasing one pig. Because the food company's staff only manage the purchase of pigs and do not ask about raising pigs, their work is in a very isolated state. In the rural areas of Liaoning Province, there are also livestock and veterinary work stations under the leadership of the agricultural departments. Although it does not have as many staff members as the food company, its institutions also cover every district. They only give pigs injections and treat diseases, and they do not care about raising pigs. If the leading organs of Liaoning Province can concentrate these forces and organize this force into a strong team to lead hog production at the grassroots level, then in the vast rural areas of the province, there will be a group of people who regularly consider how to strengthen the development of hog production? How many pigs should be raised? What difficulties need to be solved? If there is a shortage of feed, how can more green feed be used to replace grain? How can pig diseases be reduced to lower the mortality rate of pigs? How can more sows be kept? How can more piglets be supplied? Without these specific and arduous tasks, it is impossible to effectively promote the development of hog production by relying solely on appeals and instructions. I think this is the important key to changing the hog production situation in Liaoning Province.

If someone asks when the pork supply in Shenyang will become normal day by day? My answer is: Only by truly strengthening the leadership of hog production throughout the province can the pork supply situation be gradually improved with certainty. Otherwise, although the situation will gradually improve, it will improve very slowly, and even if it improves, it will not be consolidated. The people are obviously very unhappy with this situation, and we must strive to fundamentally change it.

    光靠指示和号召是不行的
    辽宁省的生猪生产领导工作必须从根本上加以改变
    本报记者　陆灏
    猪肉本来是大体够吃的；但现在沈阳等地很多人已经半年多吃不到猪肉了。
    自从去年第四季度以来，沈阳市除了医院、疗养院、托儿所、饮食业和某些必须供应猪肉的单位或个人平常能分配到一些猪肉外，在全市出售猪肉的商店长期买不到猪肉。不但在沈阳是如此，在辽宁省的大连、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、阜新、锦州等城市，很多人一连好几个月吃不到猪肉。
    有人说，辽宁省的猪肉供应之所以比别的省份格外紧张，主要是因为本省工矿集中的大、中城市太多，因此全省农村的生猪无法满足这样多的城市的需要。于是有人就说：要想满足这些城市猪肉供应的需要，除非中央从别的地方调拨一些猪肉来，否则情况是很难改善的。实际的情况是怎样呢？远的不说，就说1955年，全省养猪三百九十一万头，收购生猪的数字是一百零三万七千头，另外，还外调了二十六万二千九百头。这就是说，不但本省大体够吃，而且还能外销。在1956年，全省养猪降到三百三十七万头，收购生猪还保持了一百零三万头，上半年还外调了十万三千八百头。可是到了今年2月，全省养猪只有二百九十五万头，全年收购生猪下降到八十万头。中央为了照顾辽宁省人民的猪肉供应，今年决定从内蒙古、河南等地调拨十四万一千六百头生猪给辽宁。就是这样，现在看来猪肉供应的紧张状况还是得不到缓和。可见辽宁省的猪肉本来是大体够吃的，现在吃不到，主要是生猪的生产下降了，是国家收购生猪的数量减少了，加以人民对于猪肉供应的需要日益增涨，矛盾就显得格外尖锐。
    据辽宁省商业部门的统计，全省现有猪二百九十五万头，猪的总数比1952年下降27.9％；比1956年少12.4％。按照省人民委员会的计划，全省今年准备收购肥猪一百十五万头。后来与各方磋商，改为收购一百一十万头。到了今年1月，最后决定收购九十万头。但是，目前城市服务厅认为今年要收购八十万头信心也不大。直接从事生猪收购的省食品公司，原来估计只能收购六十五万头。经过最近市县经理会议的再三核计，也认为只能收购七十五万头。就是收购七十五万头，很多县的食品公司还是认为难以完成任务。这样，人们不能不关心地问：辽宁省的生猪生产究竟为什么这样逐年下降？生猪生产本身到底有些什么困难？
    挫伤农民养猪积极性的因素很多，具体帮助农民解决养猪困难的工作却做得不多。
    从辽宁省的养猪情况来看，养猪生产的困难是多方面的。而在各个地区，困难的原因和程度也不是完全相同的。譬如某些地区缺乏猪饲料便是阻碍生猪生产发展的严重困难之一，在特产作物地区和歉收地区更是如此。很多地方在去年9月采取了“见猪留粮”的办法，即是见一口猪留粮一百斤；但9月以后喂养的仔猪，饲料问题就没有办法解决了。辽宁省猪的疫病很猖獗，因而猪的死亡率也很高，这对于农民养猪也是一个很大的威胁。据省统计局对于八个点的农民家计调查推算，1956年猪的死亡率占养猪总数23.1％。某些收购生猪的工作人员的脱离群众的工作作风在一定程度上也给养猪生产带来了不利的影响，有些地方收购肥猪百般挑剔，有一位省长问辽阳县的县委书记：“你们的猪怎么收购不上来？”县委书记叹息地说：“省长啊！食品公司的收购人员买猪比挑爱人还困难呢！”农民们的反感便可想而知了。
    辽宁省生猪生产发展缓慢的另外一个重要原因就是猪源不足。全省在1956年年底只有母猪三十七万到三十八万头，如以每头母猪下仔猪十五头计算，全年可生仔猪五百七十万头，扣去25％的小猪死亡数，加上全年育肥数，只有生猪四百六十五万头，比省计划养猪五百五十万头还差八十多万头。母猪很少就造成了目前仔猪奇缺的情况，自从中央指示各地提高生猪购销价格以来，农民们养一头猪大约可赚一、二十元，这对于鼓舞农民的养猪积极性有着很大好处；但现在值得注意的是有的地方仔猪的价钱已经高了一倍多，仔猪价钱昂贵的结果，农民们自然就相对地减少了生猪价格提高的实惠，这对于发展养猪生产当然也是不利的。总之，就整个情况来看，在已往这一段时间，挫伤农民养猪积极性的因素是很多的，至于如何具体地领导和帮助农民解决养猪问题中的困难，虽然辽宁省已经也做了不少工作，但和今年养猪五百五十万头的艰巨任务相比，还是做得不够的。
    发展生猪生产虽然已经引起了领导上的重视，但有关的负责人至今仍然心中无数
    中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会自从去年下半年开始，对于发展生猪生产的问题已经开始重视。为了支持生猪生产的发展，不久之前省的领导机关还坚决拨出了二万吨粮食和本来打算烧酒用的五万斤糠麸作为饲猪的料。特别是从中央发布了关于发展生猪生产的决定和提高猪肉的购销价格以后，从总的趋势来看，农民的养猪积极性是增长了，尽管仔猪的价格很高，农民还是争相购买，养猪的数字日有发展。近来收购生猪的数字也有了一些提高，3月份的收购数字也比前两个月增加了一倍还多。尽管如此，生猪生产的发展和人民需要的距离并未因此显著地有所缩短。当然发展生猪生产是需要一定的过程的。从一只仔猪长成肥猪，大约需要十三个月的时间，人们不能够希望生猪生产这种事情在一个很短的时间里就大有成就。但是，猪肉供应不正常的状况已经延续了半年多，人们不能不关心地问：究竟在什么时候生猪生产的发展才能使猪肉的供应趋于正常？人们长期吃不到猪肉的情况究竟到什么时候才能够得到改变？
    这里没有一个有关的负责人可以对于这个问题作出比较接近肯定的回答。人们只是含含糊糊地说：生猪生产有发展，收购数字有增长，可能到今年的第四季度会好一些。是不是到今年的第四季度一定会比现在好一些？人们摇摇头说：这个我心里也实在没有数。这就是问题的所在。
    辽宁省人民委员会农业厅是负责生猪生产日常工作的领导部门，但是这个厅具体负责生猪工作的人只有三个，有一个时期甚至只有一个人，实际上难以担负起目前繁重的生猪生产的任务。粮食厅掌管猪的饲料，但由于对生猪生产具体情况不清楚，结果有的市、县拨了很多饲料，但那里的猪数很少；有些确实很缺饲料的市、县却不能及时得到饲料。商业部门只管收购生猪，他们当然更管不着养猪，生猪生产情况自然也就了解得很少。省级机关的这些部门，它们平常对于生猪生产的问题彼此之间既很少联系，也缺乏常常在一起进行通盘地研究。他们各有系统，各司其职，相互间的配合也很差。到了县里，这种情况就更加严重。不少县从表面上看来，既发过指示，也开过会，但实际上是号召多，具体工作做得少。生猪生产的问题还没有被经常提到县级领导机关的日程上来，它只是被交给农林局来管，但农林局，也往往全权交给人数既少力量又弱的畜牧股办理。在很多县份里，生猪生产基本上还是自流的。从县到区，从区到乡直到农业社，究竟要采取些什么措施才能保证养活多少猪？已经养猪和准备养猪的究竟有些什么具体的困难？像饲料、仔猪、猪源以及防治猪的病疫等问题究竟怎样才能具体地逐渐予以解决？农业社在粪价、垫圈、拉土等问题上又如何帮助养猪户解决具体困难？这些问题还是很少有人来通盘研究，通盘考虑。大家知道，我们养猪生产是采取“私有、私养、公助”的方针的，如果缺少具体而有力的“公助”，“私有、私养”就变成很难“有”，也很难“养”了。
    因为缺乏具体领导，所以在生猪生产困难较少的地区情况也是不妙的。
    由于缺乏具体的领导，所以，纵然某些地区生猪生产的困难要少一些；但目前的状况也是不妙的。辽宁省去年是连续第六年的大丰收，绝大多数地区的粮食都比往年多收。像社社有余粮的新民县，去年收购肥猪四万一千三百三十七头，今年估计只能收购三万头。比去年少收四分之一还多。只有六个农业社缺粮的台安县，去年第一季度收购生猪七千零六十头，今年同期只收购了一千五百多头。有些农业社的社员，去年因为大丰收多分了很多粮食，如凤城县的白旗区、大卜区，每人分到了七百斤到一千斤粮食。粮食很多，应该说不缺猪饲料，但养猪数却比去年还低，如大卜区去年养猪一万五千七百二十八头，但现在只有猪六千四百五十五头。该县七百六十八户的人民乡，农民们今年多分十八万斤粮食，但现在的养猪数只有去年的65％。可见如果养猪缺乏领导，虽然饲料充足，生猪生产还是会落后的。生猪的严重的疫病固然影响着农民的养猪积极性，但如果缺乏领导，就是疫病较轻的地方，生猪生产的情况也并不是令人满意的。复县、新金、盖平、金县四个县，是辽宁省预防生猪病疫的联防区，那里生猪的发病率是逐年减少的。如新金县1956年的生猪病疫比1955年减少了66.6％。生猪的病疫是减少了，但养猪数却并未因此增加。据该县商业部门的普查，去年6月新金有猪六万九千六百六十五头，但今年2月的猪数下降为五万二千二百六十一头。今年比去年下降了24.9％。猪源不足，仔猪奇缺，这些问题直到现在也没有统一的考虑和部署。辽宁省统计局的一个材料说，按照全省现在能生殖的母猪繁殖小猪，到1957年底，离全年的养猪计划数还缺生猪八十一万头。增加八十一万头生猪，是一桩多么巨大的工作，这就必须在今年争取能生殖一百零八万头仔猪（按仔猪25％的死亡率，实际成活只八十一万头）。要想生殖一百零八万头仔猪，就必须新增二十二万头母猪。这就是说，要想完成在1957年底发展五百五十万头生猪的计划，就必须在今年第一季度内多留二十二万头小母猪。应该说，辽宁省统计局这笔账是算得很科学的，它对于开展本省的生猪生产提供了重要的意见。但现在第一季度已经过去了，你想知道现在究竟多留了多少小母猪？在多留这些小母猪的问题上有些什么困难？这些情况，在省里没有一个部门，也没有一个人可以具体地告诉你。
    只有把现有的力量组织成一支有力的队伍，生猪生产的情况才能从根本上好转。
    辽宁省在生猪生产上缺乏领导，是不是因为在这方面没有什么力量可以依靠呢？不是的。力量是有的，但是是分散的，力量没有被组织起来有效地使用。像辽宁省的食品公司，它在各县、区、乡都有自己的工作人员，全省食品公司的工作人员共有四千四百多人。但是，目前一天只收购猪八百头，平均六个人收购一头猪。由于食品公司的工作人员只管收猪，不问养猪，因此他们的工作处于十分孤立的状态。辽宁省的农村里，还有属于农业部门领导的畜牧兽医工作站，它的工作人员虽然没有食品公司那样多，但它的机构也遍及每一个区。他们只管给猪打针治病，养猪的事情也是不管的。辽宁省的领导机关如果能把这些力量集中起来，并把这支力量组织成为基层领导生猪生产的一支有力的队伍，这样，在全省广大的农村里，就有一批人经常考虑到如何加强生猪生产的发展？要养多少猪？要解决些什么困难？假若饲料不足，如何更多地利用青饲料来代替粮食？如何减少猪的病疫以降低猪的死亡率？如何多留一些母猪？如何才能更多地供应仔猪？没有这些具体的艰苦的工作，光靠号召和指示是不可能有力地推动生猪生产的发展的，我以为这就是改变辽宁省生猪生产状况的重要关键。
    如果有人问究竟在什么时候沈阳猪肉供应能够日趋正常？我的回答是：只有切切实实地加强了在全省范围内的生猪生产的领导，猪肉供应的情况才能有把握地逐步改善。否则，情况虽然会逐渐好一些，但好得很慢，即使好一些，它也是不巩固的。人民显然非常不欢喜这样的情况，我们必须努力从根本上加以改变。
