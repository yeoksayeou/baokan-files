Xinhua News Agency, May 24th—According to Associated Press and United Press International reports: over five thousand people in Taipei smashed the American Embassy today, protesting the release by the U.S. military authorities in Taiwan of an American soldier who killed a Chinese person.

The angry crowd threw stones at the embassy's two-story building, smashing every window. Several people climbed the embassy wall, tore down the American flag, trampled it underfoot, and then tore it to pieces. At this moment, cheers and applause erupted from the crowd.

A large number of people rushed into the American Embassy, smashing two jeeps, four sedans, and one truck in the yard. They then rushed upstairs and threw furniture, telephones, books, documents, and everything movable out of the window.

The report said that some people even attempted to burn down the American Embassy.

Since the Chiang Kai-shek clique fled to Taiwan, this has been the most violent anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people.

The report said that the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities sent armored vehicles, fire engines, and about one hundred police officers to the scene, but they could not stop the crowd's protest. These police officers were cursed by the crowd.

The report said that Sergeant Reynolds, of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, who shot and killed the Chinese man Liu Ziran, was declared not guilty by the Taipei U.S. military court yesterday at noon. Reynolds and his wife and daughter have already taken a plane to return to the United States via Manila today.
