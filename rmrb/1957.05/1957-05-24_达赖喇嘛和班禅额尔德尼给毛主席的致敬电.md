Telegrams of Greetings from the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni to Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao:

	On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and as Lhasa and major cities in Tibet hold enthusiastic celebrations, I, on behalf of all Han and Tibetan staff working in Tibet and all monks and lay people in Tibet, extend warm congratulations and high respect to you and the State Council.

	In the six years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, you, and the State Council, all Han and Tibetan staff and all monks and lay people have worked hard to implement the agreement, and have achieved considerable success in various tasks.

	In the future, we will continue to strengthen the unity between all nationalities in China and within the Tibetan nationality in the spirit of the agreement, and strive unremittingly to build the motherland and a new Tibet!

		Dalai Lama
			May 23, 1957

Respected Chairman Mao:

	On the happy occasion of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, with utmost joy, I, on behalf of the monks and lay people of Tibet, extend heartfelt gratitude and respect to you – our great leader.

	In the six years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the Peaceful Agreement is being gradually and thoroughly implemented in Tibet, and the people are enjoying the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief. The unity within Tibet and between the fraternal nationalities of the motherland has reached an unprecedented level of intimacy; significant achievements have been made in various tasks, developments have taken place in various constructions, and people's lives have been improved. We know that this is due to your meticulous care, and therefore all the monks and lay people of Tibet are praying day and night for your longevity.

	Chairman Mao, we vow: to forever unite closely around you, further consolidate unity, and strengthen the forces of anti-imperialism and patriotism; actively do a good job in the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and work together to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

		Panchen Erdeni May 23
