    A House for Less Than Two Hundred Yuan
    (Our report) To solve the problem of employee housing, the Yipinglang Coal Mine in Yunnan plans to build 260 houses this year using a self-build, publicly-assisted method. The first batch of ninety houses will be completed before May. Type A houses are 29.6 square meters per unit and cost 192.5 yuan; Type B houses are 26.5 square meters and cost 172 yuan. Because of the low cost, the masses are very satisfied.
    The funds for building the houses are borrowed by the administration from the Construction Bank, and then loaned to individual self-building households. It is stipulated that each household must pay a minimum of 50 yuan in advance. Those who cannot pay can use their spare time to contract self-building work to offset part of the advance payment. The loan term generally does not exceed three years, and the administration deducts repayments on a monthly basis.

    一幢房子不到二百元
    本报讯　为解决职工宿舍问题，云南一平浪煤矿今年准备采用自建公助的办法，建造二百六十户住宅。第一批九十户5月以前竣工。甲种住宅每户二十九点六平方公尺，造价一百九十二元五角；乙种住宅二十六点五平方公尺，造价一百七十二元。因为造价低廉，群众很满意。
    建房的资金，统由行政方面向建设银行贷款，然后再分别贷给自建户个人，同时规定每户最低限度要预缴五十元。交不出的人，可以用业余时间承包自建工作来抵偿一部分预交资金。贷款期限，一般不超过三年，由行政上按月扣还。
