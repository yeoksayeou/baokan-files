    Manufacturing Pneumatic Tool Parts with Domestically Produced New Steel Grades
    Deputy Chief Engineer of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory Sun Zhonghe
    Manufacturing pneumatic tools requires a large amount of low-carbon nickel-chromium and low-carbon chromium alloy structural steel. In the past, nickel and chromium elements have always relied on foreign imports. In the first quarter of this year, the state required a reduction in the percentage of nickel-chromium alloy elements in alloy steel in order to save foreign exchange. In the second and third quarters, the supply of this type of alloy element may even be completely stopped. However, China's mining industry is developing rapidly, and the supply of rock drills and other equipment must be increased accordingly. This poses the following problem for our factory: should we actively and proactively overcome all difficulties and strive to meet the needs of the state in a timely manner? Or should we allow a large shortage of much-needed pneumatic tools?

    Obviously, we must not bow our heads in the face of difficulties, but must proactively take all measures to ensure a large supply of pneumatic tools. The key to the problem is whether we can find ways to use less or no chromium steel and nickel-chromium steel, and instead use domestically produced alloy steel and carbon steel, etc. to replace them. Therefore, the substitution of steel materials has become one of the major problems that our factory urgently needs to solve this year.

    Actively realizing the conversion to using domestic resources to manufacture pneumatic tools is an arduous and urgent task. Starting in December last year, all the engineering and technical personnel in our factory, under the leadership of the Chief Engineer's Office, began a broad effort to collect data and conduct analysis and research. After a month of hard work, everyone put forward more than fifty suggestions and measures for material substitution. After further consolidation and research by relevant departments, a steel material substitution plan was formulated. According to this plan, thirty-three types of parts were quickly changed. This not only alleviated the tense situation of nickel-chromium alloy supply, but also greatly reduced product costs, saving the country about 160,000 yuan for the whole year.

    At the same time, systematic experimental research work was also started on thirteen representative important parts, changing them to use domestically sourced alloy steel (manganese-molybdenum steel, molybdenum steel, chromium-manganese-molybdenum steel) or other metallic materials (carbon steel, ductile iron). This is the most important part of the plan. Preliminary experiments have shown that, with the exception of a few parts, there is a high probability that other nickel-chromium steel and chromium steel parts can be substituted.

    As early as April and May 1956, we had already started some experimental research work on material substitution. Due to a lack of planning, dispersed work, unclear steps, and unsystematic methods, the results were not significant. This year's experimental work began by learning from past lessons, ensuring that the experiments were conducted in an organized and planned manner.

    To conduct systematic substitution research, we must first understand the supply conditions of domestic resources and the possible extent of future imports of relevant materials. China is rich in molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, and other resources. The supply of ferrochrome is relatively stable. The metallurgical system has already provided molybdenum steel and silicon-manganese steel, and will provide other new alloy steel grades. This is the material basis for us to formulate the above-mentioned experimental research plan for thirteen important parts.

    Mechanical manufacturing is our specialty, but our research capabilities on metal properties are insufficient. We are not familiar enough with the smelting of new steel grades. We do not have sufficient understanding of the conditions for conducting industrial experiments in mines. Therefore, the entire experimental research process would be difficult to carry out without the active assistance of relevant units.

    Recognizing our own weaknesses, after our draft experimental plan was proposed, we went to consult the Shenyang Metal Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Benxi Steel Plant, a certain mine, and Harbin Institute of Technology, who all provided very valuable opinions and gave us a lot of help. Mr. Zhang Peilin of the Metal Research Institute helped us to review the experimental plan in detail. He not only provided directional suggestions, but also helped us revise the plan to substitute carbon steel for valve plates, greatly strengthening the bearing capacity of the parts. The party and government leaders of Benxi Steel Plant, in order to assist us in entering the experiment as soon as possible, mobilized workers to specially trial-produce a furnace of manganese-molybdenum steel for us, and sent technical cadres to discuss continued cooperation methods. A certain mine also quickly reached an agreement with us. In order to meet the requirements of the experiment, they also changed the usage system of rock drills. The teachers and students of Harbin Institute of Technology who were interning at the factory, together with the workers of our factory, carried out the determination of critical points of manganese-molybdenum steel. During the experiment, the Metal Research Institute is conducting more detailed and accurate performance tests for us. In early March, when we held a report meeting on the performance test results of manganese-molybdenum steel and molybdenum steel, comrades from these units enthusiastically participated in the discussion. This gave us more confidence, both theoretically and practically, to affirm the results of certain experiments and determine the next steps to take.

    The alloy steel parts needed by our pneumatic tool factory will all be manufactured using new steel grades.

### 用国产新钢种制造风动工具的零件

    用国产新钢种制造风动工具的零件
    沈阳风动工具厂副总工程师　孙钟和
    制造风动工具，需要大量的低碳镍铬和低碳铬合金结构钢。镍铬元素过去一向依靠外国进口；在今年第一季度内，国家要求降低镍铬合金元素在合金钢中的百分比，以节省外汇。而在二、三季度以后，这种合金元素甚至很有停止供应的可能。但是，我国采掘工业却在迅速发展，凿岩机等的供应又必须相应的增加，这就在我厂面前摆着这样一个问题：是积极主动克服一切困难，争取及时满足国家需要呢？还是使各方急需的风动工具大量脱销？
    很显然，我们决不能在困难面前低头，必须主动采取一切措施来保证风动工具大量供应；而问题的关键就是我们能否设法不用或少用铬钢和镍铬钢，而利用国内资源冶炼的合金钢和炭素钢等来代替它。因此钢材的代用便成为我厂今年迫切需要解决的重大问题之一。
    积极实现改用国内资源制造风动工具，这是一件繁重而急迫的任务。我们全厂的工程技术人员从去年12月开始，在总工程师室领导下，一个广泛的收集资料、进行分析研究的工作开始了。经过一个月的努力，大家提出了五十多项材料代用的建议与措施。又经过有关科室人员的进一步归并研究，拟定了钢材代用方案。根据这个方案，有三十三种部件很快进行了更改。这样不仅缓和了镍铬合金供应的紧张局面，而且也使产品成本大大降低，全年可为国家节约十六万元左右。
    与此同时，对十三种有代表性的重要部件，也开始进行了系统的改用国家资源冶炼的合金钢（锰钼钢、钼钢、铬锰钼钢）或其他金属材料（炭素钢，球墨铸铁）的试验研究工作。这是方案中最重要的一项。初步试验证明，除少数部件外，其它镍铬钢和铬钢部件都有很大可能被代用。
    远在1956年4、5月间，我们就已开始做了一些材料代用的试验研究工作，由于缺乏计划，工作分散，步骤不明确，方法不系统等原因，收效不大。今年的试验工作，一开始便吸取了以往的教训，做到了有组织有计划的进行试验。
    要进行系统的代用研究，就必须首先摸清国内资源的供应条件和今后有关资材进口的可能程度。我国钼、钨、锰等资源十分丰富；铬铁供应比较稳定；冶金系统已经提供了钼钢和矽锰钢，并将提供其他新的合金钢种。这就是我们能够制定出上述十三种重要部件试验研究计划的物质基础。
    机械制造是我们的本行，对于金属性能的研究力量我们是不够的；新钢种的冶炼我们是不够熟悉的；在矿山进行工业试验的条件我们是不够了解的。因而整个试验研究过程，如果离开有关单位的积极帮助，是很难进行的。
    认识到我们自己的弱点，当我们的试验计划草案提出后，即分头去请教科学院沈阳金属研究所、本溪钢厂、某矿山和哈尔滨工业大学，他们都提出了非常宝贵的意见，给了我们很多帮助。金属研究所张沛霖先生，帮助我们详细审查试验计划，他不仅提出了方向性的建议，而且帮助我们修改了阀片以炭素钢代用的计划，使零件的承受能力大大加强。本溪钢厂的党政领导，为了协助我们尽速进入试验，他们发动职工专门为我们试炼了一炉锰钼钢，并派来技术干部商定继续协作的办法。某矿山也很快地和我们达成了协议，为了符合试验的要求，他们还改变了凿岩机的使用制度。哈尔滨工业大学在厂实习的师生，同我厂职工一道进行了锰钼钢的临界点等测定。在试验过程中，金属研究所正在为我们进行更为细致、准确的性能试验。3月初旬我们举行锰钼钢和钼钢性能试验结果报告会时，这些单位的同志们又都热情参与了讨论。使我们从理论上、实践上更有把握地肯定某些试验的结果，决定了下一步要走的路子。
    我们风动工具厂需要用合金钢制造的零部件，将全部用新的钢种制造。
