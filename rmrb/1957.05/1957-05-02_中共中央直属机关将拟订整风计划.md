The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Direct Organs to Draft Rectification Plan

(Our newspaper report) The Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting on April 30 to convey the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the rectification movement; and discussed the issue of immediately launching a rectification movement in the Party organizations of the directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The meeting held that the current enthusiastic discussion and study of Chairman Mao Zedong's two reports on the issue of the correct handling of contradictions among the people, etc., in the directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is precisely what the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out: "In fact, this is the beginning of the rectification movement." Therefore, the meeting requested that all Party members in the directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee must earnestly and deeply study the two reports of Chairman Mao Zedong at the Supreme State Council and the National Propaganda Work Conference, as well as the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the rectification movement before the rectification plan is determined.

The speeches at the meeting pointed out that during the study process, Party members must deeply understand that this rectification movement must adopt new methods, that is, "an ideological education movement that is both serious and earnest, yet gentle and mild," and "a movement of appropriate criticism and self-criticism," not holding large criticism meetings or large struggle sessions, but holding small forums or group meetings, or taking the form of heart-to-heart talks among comrades. The Party members of the directly subordinate organs have the experience of the 1942 rectification movement, as well as the experience of the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952 and the ideological criticism in 1955; these experiences may have a good side that makes this rectification movement develop smoothly, but also a difficult side. That is: on the one hand, some comrades may have ideological concerns and dare not carry out criticism and self-criticism, or think that they may be "attacked"; on the other hand, some comrades still have impatient emotions and may not be accustomed to or good at mastering the new methods to be adopted now. Therefore, during the study process, as well as during the process of inspecting, summarizing, and improving work, we must pay attention to breaking down ideological concerns, focusing on creating an atmosphere of free criticism, both boldly encouraging criticism and avoiding one-sided and excessive criticism.

The meeting studied the specific issues of the steps, methods, and timing of carrying out the rectification movement, and decided to immediately draft a specific work plan for carrying out the rectification movement in the directly subordinate organs. The meeting also exchanged views on how to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on advocating the combination of mental and physical labor. The meeting also decided to convene the Second Congress of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in mid-May to mobilize and arrange for the launch of the rectification movement. On May 4, an enlarged meeting of the Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will continue to be held to discuss the specific work plan for the rectification.

### 中共中央直属机关将拟订整风计划

    中共中央直属机关将拟订整风计划
    本报讯　中国共产党中央直属机关委员会在4月30日举行会议，传达了中共中央关于整风运动的指示；并且讨论了立即在中共中央直属各机关党组织中开展整风运动的问题。
    会议认为，目前在中共中央直属各机关对毛泽东主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题等两个报告的热烈讨论和学习，正是中共中央指示中指出的：“实际上，这就是整风运动的开始。”因此，会议要求中直各机关的党员同志们，在整风计划确定以前，必须认真地深入地学习毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上和全国宣传工作会议上的两个报告，以及中共中央关于整风运动的指示。
    会议发言中指出：在学习过程中，要求党员同志们必须深刻地理解到这次整风运动必须采用新的方法，就是“既严肃认真又和风细雨的思想教育运动”，“恰如其分的批评和自我批评的运动”，不是开大批评会或大斗争会，而是开小座谈会或小组会，或是多采取同志间的谈心方式。中直机关的党员同志，对于整风运动，有1942年的整风经验，也有1952年的
  “三反”和1955年的思想批判的经验；这些经验，有可能使这次整风运动顺利开展的好的一面，也有着困难的一面。这就是：一方面，可能有些同志有思想顾虑，不敢开展批评和自我批评，或者以为可能要受到“打击”；另一方面，有些同志却还有急躁情绪，可能不习惯或不善于掌握现在所要采取的新方法。因此，必须在学习过程中，以及在检查、总结和改进工作的过程中，注意打破思想顾虑，注重造成自由批评的风气，既能放手鼓励批评，又能避免片面的过火的批评。
    会议研究了开展整风运动的步骤、方法和时间等具体问题，决定立即拟订在中直各机关开展整风运动的具体工作计划。会议并交换了如何贯彻执行中共中央提倡脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合指示的意见。会议并决定在5月中旬召开中共中央直属机关第二次代表大会，动员和布置开展整风运动。5月4日，将继续召开中共中央直属机关委员会扩大会议讨论整风的具体工作计划。
