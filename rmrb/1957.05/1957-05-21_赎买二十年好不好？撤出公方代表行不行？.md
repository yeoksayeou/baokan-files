Is Twenty Years of Redemption Good?
Is it Okay to Withdraw Public Representatives? Chen Yuze said:

    Li Kangnian is mainly speaking for middle-level capitalists

Xu Zisu, Standing Committee Member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and Deputy Manager of the Pharmaceutical Industry Company, and Ni Shuping, Member of the Tianjin Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Deputy Manager of the Chemical Pharmaceutical Industry Company, said that the number of years for fixed interest is not a major issue. The current seven-year regulation is already satisfactory, and even a few less years would be acceptable. Chen Yuze, Deputy Director of the No. 2 Factory of the Tianjin Dyestuff Chemical Industry Company's joint state-private enterprise, believes that Li Kangnian's proposal is mainly speaking for middle-level capitalists. Meng Naiquan, Executive Committee Member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and of the joint state-private enterprise Hengyuan Textile Factory, believes that after capitalists receive their redemption bonds and withdraw their capital on schedule, it is not "no exploitation," because the capital they receive is still money from exploiting workers. Only when capitalists live entirely on their own labor income can they be transformed into genuine self-reliant laborers and change their class composition. Twenty years of fixed interest is too long, which will slow down the transformation of the bourgeoisie. Wu Zhichao said:

    Don't send public representatives

Wu Zhichao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and General Manager of Tianchu MSG Factory, believes that public representatives should not be sent to joint venture enterprises. He recently attended a forum with private sector personnel from 30 factories in the chemical raw materials industry, where 29 factory owners advocated abolishing public representatives. One factory advocated maintaining the status quo because the relationship between the private sector and workers was very tense, and the presence of public representatives could ease the conflict between the two. Huang Shenglin and others believe:

    Give power to the private sector, and the Party branch secretary can only supervise

Huang Shenglin, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Dazhonghua Rubber Factory, Li Zhengwu, Deputy Manager of Hengyuan, and Xu Zhenguo, Deputy Director of the Bicycle Frame Factory, all advocated withdrawing public representatives and believed that if the public representatives continued to work under the leadership of the Party branch secretary after their withdrawal, it would be the same wine in a new bottle, because many factory public representatives also served as Party branch secretaries, which would lead to the Party replacing the government and the Party and government not being separated. They believe that power should be handed over to the private sector, and the Party branch secretary should only supervise them. Liu Jingji believes:

    Try letting the private sector be independently responsible

Liu Jingji, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and General Manager of Anda Textile Factory, believes that in factories that are larger in scale, have sound Party and trade union organizations, and where private sector personnel have definite prospects for cultivation, it may be possible to try withdrawing public representatives. Letting the private sector be independently responsible to the state shows the state's trust in them. "A scholar dies for his confidant," and the private sector will definitely work hard to run the enterprise well. It is possible that the private sector will not do well at the beginning, but taking on the burden may lead to training, which may enable them to be cultivated into genuine state cadres. There have already been such examples in Shanghai. For example, the private sector deputy director of the Dalong Machinery Factory had to take on all administrative responsibilities because the public sector director was ill for a long time. Things that he didn't know how to do before, such as arranging production, summarizing work, and giving mobilization reports, etc., he could now do. As a result, the masses' perception of him also changed, and he himself felt that he was no longer like a private sector person. Lü Luyuan and others believe:

    Private sector personnel are not capable of managing new enterprises

Lü Luyuan, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Beiyang Yarn Factory, and Zhai Zhihong, Director of the Dazhonghua Rubber Factory, and others believe that the public representative is not just a personal matter, but represents the state. It is necessary to consider: the views of the workers on the private sector and the views of the private sector personnel on each other; the private sector still receives interest, and class relations still exist; the private sector personnel used to manage old enterprises, and the management was patriarchal. Today, we must rely on the workers to democratically manage new enterprises, and the private sector personnel are not capable of this; the private sector itself still has shortcomings and must undergo self-transformation, etc. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 赎买二十年好不好？撤出公方代表行不行？

    赎买二十年好不好？
    撤出公方代表行不行？陈毓曾说：
    李康年主要是替中户资本家说话
    天津市工商业联合会常务委员、制药工业公司副经理许子素，民主建国会天津市委员会委员、化学制药工业公司副经理倪叔平等人说，定息多少年不是一个主要问题，现在规定七年，已经满意，就是少几年也是可以的。天津市染料化学工业公司公私合营第二厂副厂长陈毓曾认为李康年的建议主要是替中户资本家说话。天津市工商联执行委员、公私合营恒源纺织厂孟乃全认为资本家领了赎买存单之后，按期取回资本，并不是“没有剥削”了，因为所领的资本，还是剥削工人来的钱。资本家只有到了完全凭着自己劳动收入生活时，才能改造成为名副其实的自食其力的劳动者，才能改变阶级成份。定息二十年，时间太长了，这会使资产阶级的改造进行得更慢。吴志超说：
    不要派公方代表
    上海市工商联副秘书长、天厨味精厂总经理吴志超认为在合营企业里不要派公方代表。他最近参加化学原料工业中三十个厂的私方人员座谈会，有二十九个厂主张取消公方代表，其中一家主张维持现状，原因是私方和工人关系很紧张，有了公方代表，可以缓和两者间的矛盾。黄胜林等认为：
    把权力交给私方，党支书只能监督
    天津大中华橡胶厂副厂长黄胜林、恒源副经理李征吾和自行车架子厂副厂长徐振国三人主张撤出公方代表，并认为公方代表撤出后如果还在党支部书记领导下工作将是换汤不换药，因为许多厂公方代表就兼党支部书记，而且那样会导致以党代政、党政不分。他们认为，把权力交给私方，党支书只要对他进行监督就行了。刘靖基认为：
    试由私方独立负责
    上海市工商联常委、安达纺织厂总经理刘靖基认为，在那些规模较大、党和工会组织健全、而私方人员确有培养前途的工厂，可以试行撤出公方代表。由私方独立对国家负责，表示国家对他的信任。“士为知己者死”，私方一定拼命搞好企业。可能一开始私方做得不好，但担子挑起来，可能得到锻炼，而使他们可能培养成为真正的国家干部。这样的例子在上海已经有了。像大隆机器厂的私方副厂长，因为公方厂长长期生病，不得不担起全部行政责任。原来不会做的事，像布置生产、总结工作、动员报告等等也会做了。由此群众对他的看法也有不同，他自己也感觉得不再像是个私方人员。吕露园等认为：
    管理新企业，私方人员不行
    天津北洋纱厂副厂长吕露园、大中华橡胶厂厂长翟志宏等人认为公方代表不单单是他一个人的问题，而是代表国家。必须考虑到：职工对私方的观感和私方人员之间的观感；私方还拿利息，阶级关系还存在；私方人员过去经营的是旧企业，管理是家长式，今天要依靠工人群众民主管理新企业，私方人员不行；私方本身还有缺点，还要自我改造等等。　（据新华社讯）
