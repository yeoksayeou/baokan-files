May snow fell in the Rhine River valley. Mr. Macmillan arrived in Bonn on the Rhine under this rare climate. This is the first time in twelve years since the war that a British Prime Minister has visited West Germany.

People are talking about it: in two days, he and Adenauer reached the first "Anglo-German compromise" since the "Chamberlain era." Washington is closely watching this "compromise" activity to see if it will endanger American interests, because politicians in Britain and West Germany have long been talking about the possibility of the two countries taking some form of "cooperation" to deal with the United States.

What is the background of this "compromise"?

West Germany is a major member of the so-called "Little Europe" plan. Behind this plan is the intention of the United States to control Western Europe. Recently, the press has been spreading the news that Macmillan is planning a "Greater Europe" composed of a dozen or so countries in Northern and Western Europe to counter this "Little Europe."

Furthermore, West Germany is participating in the "Common Market"; while Britain is stepping up the implementation of the "Free Trade Area" plan. West Germany hopes to economically dominate Western Europe through the former, while Britain wants to use the latter to maintain and strengthen its economic position in Western Europe.

Britain is actively developing nuclear weapons and wants to reduce the number of conventional troops and reduce military spending. Britain's "arms revolution" makes Adenauer uneasy, because the Bonn authorities are vigorously advocating accelerating the establishment of the West German army and are planning to start catching up with Britain in this area through a joint venture of atomic energy.

At the same time, the press also rumored that the Macmillan government is considering re-proposing the "Eden Plan" with the "neutralization" and "unification" of Germany as its content. This added another concern to the pro-American faction in West Germany.

It was these multiple contradictions that prompted the leaders of these two "allied" countries, who were constantly scheming against each other, to come together to try to find some compromise that would be beneficial to both sides.

The result of the talks was: West Germany expressed its support for Britain's "Free Trade Area" plan, and both sides believed that it could become a "supplement" to the "Common Market." Adenauer also expressed his approval of Macmillan's plan to "adjust" and "simplify" European institutions. In exchange, the British Prime Minister promised to support the "Common Market" plan and put the implementation of the "Free Trade Area" plan after the "Common Market" treaty. Britain also expressed its support for Adenauer's policies on the German unification issue.

The differences between the two sides on the issue of British troop reductions have not been resolved. Britain is unwilling to postpone the implementation of its plan to withdraw some troops from West Germany. West German Defense Minister Strauss will go to London soon to continue negotiations.

It seems that Adenauer's focus is to struggle through the general election in September this year, and strive to reduce the resistance that is unfavorable to his election, so he is happy to get Britain's "understanding" and support. And Macmillan is simply trying to safeguard the interests of the British Empire. Especially after the news about the "US-West German axis" came out, Britain was extremely eager to reach some kind of compromise and understanding with West Germany.

It is still difficult to say that Macmillan's trip was worthwhile. Local, temporary compromises cannot eliminate the fundamental contradictions between two imperialist enemies. But for West Germany, which is accustomed to obeying the United States and lacks independent steps after the war, and Britain, which has suffered a lot but still clings to the United States, this is indeed a new sign in diplomacy.

    伦敦和波恩间的“妥协”
    何疆
    莱因河流域下着五月雪。麦克米伦先生在这种罕见的气候中到了莱因河畔的波恩。这是战后十二年来英国首相第一次访问西德。
    人们谈论着：他和阿登纳在两天里达成了“张伯伦时代”以后的第一次“英德妥协”。华盛顿方面密切注视这种“妥协”的活动，看它是否会危及美国的利益，因为英国和西德政界很久以来就有人在谈论着两国采取某种方式的“合作”来对付美国的可能性问题。
    这次“妥协”的背景是什么呢？
    西德是所谓“小欧洲”计划中的主要成员。而在这个计划的背后，是美国控制西欧的意图。近来，报界盛传：麦克米伦正在筹划一个由北欧和西欧十几国组成的“大欧洲”来对抗这个“小欧洲”。
    再者，西德参加“共同市场”；而英国则在加紧推行“自由贸易区”方案。西德指望通过前者在经济上称霸西欧，而英国要用后者来保持和加强它在西欧的经济地位。
    英国正在积极发展原子核武器，并且要裁减常规军队人数和减少军费开支。英国这种“军备革命”使阿登纳感到不安，因为波恩当局正在大力鼓吹加紧建立西德军队，并策划通过原子能的联营来开始在这方面赶上英国。
    同时报界还传说：麦克米伦政府正在考虑重新提出以德国“中立化”和“统一”为内容的“艾登计划”。这又给西德亲美派添了一桩心事。
    就是这重重矛盾，促使这两个相互勾心斗角的“盟国”的领袖，聚到一起来试图找到某种双方都有利可图的妥协。
    会谈的结果是：西德表示支持英国的“自由贸易区”方案，双方认为它可以成为“共同市场”的“补充”。阿登纳还表示赞同麦克米伦的欧洲机构“调整”和“简化”计划。作为交换条件，英国首相答应支持“共同市场”计划，并把“自由贸易区”计划的实行放在“共同市场”条约之后。英国还在德国统一问题上表示支持阿登纳的政策。
    双方在英国裁减军队问题上的分歧却没有解决。英国不愿延期执行它的从西德撤出部分军队的计划。西德国防部长施特劳斯不久还要到伦敦去继续谈判。
    看来，阿登纳的着眼点是要勉力度过今年9月的大选，力图减少不利自己当选的阻力，因此乐于得到英国的“谅解”和支持。而麦克米伦则无非是设法要维护英帝国的利益。特别是在关于“美国—西德轴心”的消息传出之后，英国极想能够同西德获致某种妥协和默契。
    要说麦克米伦此行不虚，那还是很难的。局部的、暂时的妥协不能消除两个帝国主义世仇之间的根本矛盾。但是对于战后惯于顺从美国和缺乏独立步骤的西德以及虽然受尽了气但仍然把住美国大腿的英国说来，这倒不失为外交上的一点新迹象。
