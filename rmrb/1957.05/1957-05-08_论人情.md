All good literary and artistic works conform to and accord with human sentiment. Literature and art express human emotions and thoughts, and everyone possesses common human sentiments, so works can move people's hearts. Those poems, operas, and novels can depict the human sentiments of hundreds or thousands of years ago, and we still feel the same way today, moved to tears or cheering in unison; those poems, operas, and novels that depict modern life, if they cannot express human sentiment appropriately, can make people laugh or cry inappropriately, or remain indifferent. We are often familiar with the plots of operas, but the thoroughness of the performance of human sentiment can make people know the ending but still want to watch it to the end. In the play Qin Xianglian, Bao Gong must chop off Chen Shimei's head to accord with human sentiment and natural justice; otherwise, he would not be Bao Gong. In the Qin Xianglian performed by Little White Jade Frost, the audience clearly knows that she will achieve the final victory, but they still want to see her succeed before they can feel relieved and cheer. That depends on the art of performance.

We admire those stone carvings, clay sculptures, and bronze statues of Buddha, admiring the expression in their eyes, the interest in their fingertips, and the demeanor in the folds of their clothes, not because they are deities, and not only focusing on the exquisite gold decoration and carving or the bright and harmonious colors, but because they express human sentiment beyond the lines. Those solemnity, smiles, and endurance of suffering reflect the author's hope for the human world. Buddha is human, and Buddha statues are nothing more than the embodiment of human images. These should be things of the past, and their materials and methods cannot be mechanically imitated again. We today's people have our own solemnity, smiles, and beautiful prospects for the future, so we should express the human sentiment of the new era from real materials. Ancient art has many aspects that are still worth admiring and using today, but we must develop these long-standing artistic traditions and make them useful for our modern art today.

Modern literary and artistic works must not mechanically imitate the ancients, because human sentiment also changes with the times. Modern people should not use today's human sentiment as a yardstick to measure ancient literary and artistic works, but should look at the common sense of human sentiment of the ancients historically. Literary criticism, especially classical literary criticism, requires historical research first. Even those who are engaged in creation, if they are used to living in the city, must first be familiar with the feelings of the peasants and understand their human sentiment if they want to write about the countryside. It is not enough to only see the scenery of the countryside and how happily the peasants work. How to trace the pain and hard work of the peasants in history from the mood of today's peasants still requires studying history. However, it is not enough to only study the peasants in a scholarly and historical way without truly understanding their human sentiment and without developing genuine feelings with the peasants. Why do some authors often analyze the psychology of peasants with the feelings of intellectuals? Because they have never understood their human sentiment.

Suzhou Pingtan's storytelling is wonderful and moving because it analyzes and depicts the human sentiments and worldly conditions of ancient talented scholars, beautiful women, and all kinds of people with concise words and limited actions. When Yang Zhenxiong tells the story of the West Chamber, he often spends half an hour introducing a sentence from the West Chamber and exposing the complete human sentiment of Yingying or Zhang Sheng. How delicate and wonderful, although detailed but not complicated, although meticulous but pertinent. This kind of personalized analysis is worth savoring. They have recently told some new people and new things (such as Wang Xiahe and Liu Lianying), using traditional old methods, and their depiction of human sentiment is exciting and moving. Their brilliance is something that people engaged in spoken drama, film, and novel writing should observe and learn from.

We have recently seen some French and Indian films, which have an enlightening effect on our films in expressing human sentiment. These human sentiments are sometimes expressed in small programs, but in fact, they have profound moving points. It is not the right way to add some lively and interesting small programs to our relatively dry works. I think we should all learn from Lu Xun, who clearly expressed his deep understanding of human sentiment in his novels and essays. All those who paint or sculpt Mr. Lu Xun should first understand how Mr. Lu Xun understood the deep human sentiment of his contemporaries before they can paint or sculpt Mr. Lu Xun's image well, rather than merely haggling over his clothing and posture.

We who study history often try to find "historical shadows" from ancient myths and legends, not only do not regard myths and legends as absurd and unreliable, but also consider them to be the most precious. For those engaged in literature and art, I think the value of myths, fairy tales, and supernatural stories lies in the human sentiment and rich imagination in them, not all nonsense or random thoughts. Ancient jokes and ballads are the same. The book Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio is all about ghosts and monsters, but in fact, it is all about human sentiment. If they are truly of profound significance, then even if they appear in the form of ghosts and monsters, it is not strange and not bad. In the past, some people believed in ghosts and monsters, but most people who read Strange Tales at that time read it as a human story. Now, few people believe in ghosts and monsters, so the appearance of these ghost novels or mythological dramas should not be doubted because they appear in the form of ghosts and gods.

Great literary and artistic works of ancient and modern times often express the dignity of human nature: pursuing light in the darkness, finding a way out in difficulties, struggling and fighting under oppression, and showing indomitable courage and wisdom in times of crisis. However, in some works, it is often expressed as humorous, witty, and lighthearted joy. These are also common human sentiments: the need for short-term laughter in fatigue, the need for entrusted happiness in despair, and the need to relax after tense work. On the stage, we need clowns; good clowns can make solemn plays more solemn, tragedies more tragic, and comedies more joyful.

We often encounter some people who do not understand humor, and think that other people's jokes and witticisms are not serious. These people do not know how to laugh, do not know the benefits of laughing, and do not appreciate the wisdom of banter. Some seemingly upright moralists in ancient times were not necessarily upright; on the contrary, the "actors" in Taishi Gong's Biography of Jesters were not lacking in serious inner hearts and quick eloquence, although they "were good at joking, but it was in line with the great way." I used to have some doubts about Beijing's crosstalk. But after all, many people love to listen to it, and there must be a reason for it. I occasionally listened to it, and it does have a long historical tradition. It can sharply reflect reality. Some segments are meaningful jokes, and some have the effect of satire and education. Even if some are purely laughable, they can make people laugh, which is needed by all hard-working workers.

When people get along with each other, whether making friends or talking about serious matters, there must be some human sentiment. In the past, we Chinese had some unnecessary human sentiments, which were hypocritical, affected, and devoid of a sense of right and wrong. But talking to people we get along with every day in a serious manner all day long can also hinder the progress of work. Understanding the other person's human sentiment, having human sentiment in conversations, and handling people's affairs with human sentiment, I think things will be easier to handle. We do not welcome people who "do not visit the temple unless there is something urgent" and "cling to Buddha's feet only when in imminent danger". People should have some laughing and talking contact with each other in ordinary times. At a symposium attended by many elderly people, I heard an eighty-year-old man say that his understanding of socialism is "life is better and people get along better." These old gentlemen all advocated having a tea house for colleagues, where they can gather, chat, and perhaps solve some problems in free conversation. Serious meetings and free tea parties are both needed. I believe that life in the big family of socialism should be richer.

    论人情
    陈梦家
    一切好的文学艺术品总是顺乎人情合乎人情的。文学艺术既是表现人类的情感思想的，而人人具人情之所常，所以作品可以感动人心。那些诗歌、戏曲、小说可以表现几百年或上千年以前的人情，我们今日读之犹有同感，为之感慨落泪或同声称快；那些表现现代生活的诗歌、戏曲、小说倘使不能合乎人情的表现出来，可以使人啼笑皆非或漠然无动于中。我们对于戏文的剧情往往是熟悉的，但是表演人情的透彻，可以使人明知其结束而一定不放松地要看到底。秦香莲一剧中的包公一定要铡了陈世美才合乎人情天理，否则不成其为包公。小白玉霜所演的秦香莲，观众明明知道她要得到最后的胜利的，但毫不放松地一定要看到她的成功才放心称快而去。那就靠表演的艺术了。
    我们欣赏那些石刻的泥塑的铜铸的佛像，欣赏他们眉目间的神情、手指尖的意趣、衣折间的风度，并不因为他们是神道，并不仅仅着眼于金装和雕镂之精工或色彩的鲜丽和谐，而由于在线条以外表达了人情。那些庄严、微笑和苦难的忍受反映了作者对于人世间的希望。佛就是人，佛像无异是人像的化身而已。这些应该是过去的事，其取材取法是不可以再刻板模拟的了。我们今天的人，有他的庄严、微笑和对于未来的美境，就应该另外从真实的材料中表现新时代的人情。古代艺术，有许多地方值得我们今天依然欣赏和取用的，但必须发展这些久远的艺术传统而且使之有用于我们今天的现代艺术。
    现代的文艺作品，一定不能刻板地模拟古人，因为人情也是随时而变的。现代的人，衡量古代的文艺作品，也不可以用今天的人情作尺度，而应该历史地去看古人的人情常理。文艺的批评工作，尤其是古典的文艺评批工作，最需要先作历史的研究。就是从事创作的人们，若是住惯了城市的，要写农村就首先要熟悉农民的感情，了解他们的人情。若是仅仅看到农村的景色，看到农民如何高兴地工作，还是不够的。如何从今天农民的心情中去追溯历史上农民的痛苦和勤劳，还是需要研究历史。但是，光是学究式地历史地去研究农民，而不真懂得农民的人情，不使自己和农民发生真正的情感，那还是不成的。为什么有些作者常常用知识分子的心情去分析农民的心理，就因为他不曾懂得他们的人情。
    苏州评弹说旧书的精彩动人，在于以简练的言词和有限的动作分析出刻绘出古代才子佳人和各色人等的人情世态。杨振雄在说西厢记时，常常用半小时工夫引出一句西厢记而对莺莺或张生作了全面的人情的暴露。何其细致美妙，虽详而不繁，虽细而中肯。这种个性的分析，值得玩味。他们最近说了一些新人新事（如王孝和和刘莲英），用的是传统的老办法，而其刻绘人情激动人心，其高明处是从事话剧电影和写小说的人应该观摩的。
    我们最近看到了一些法国的和印度的电影，在表达人情一点上对我们的电影有启发的作用。这些人情，有时虽表现在小节目上，而实际上有着深刻的动人之处。我们若在比较枯燥的作品中加入一些生动有趣的小节目，那并不是正确的办法。我想我们大家应该学习鲁迅，在他的小说和杂文中十分明显地表现出他对于人情的深刻的体会。一切为鲁迅先生画像或作塑像的人们，最应该首先体会鲁迅先生如何了解他的同时代人们的人情的深刻，然后才能画好塑好鲁迅先生的像，而不是仅仅斤斤计较他的服饰和姿态。
    我们研究历史的，常常企图从古代神话传说中去寻找“历史的影子”，不但不以神话传说为荒诞不经，而且认为是最可珍贵的。对于从事文艺的人，我想神话、童话和神怪故事的可贵，就在于其中的人情和丰富的想像，并不全是胡说或乱想出来的。古代的笑话和谣谚，也是同样的。聊斋志异一书，说的全是鬼怪，其实全是人情。若是它们真正是有深刻的意义的，那末即使以鬼怪的形式出现，并不足怪，也并不不好。从前还有人相信鬼怪，但当时读聊斋的人大多数是当做人间的故事读的。现在很少人相信鬼怪了，这些鬼怪小说或神话戏剧的出现，是不必因其以鬼神的形式出现而有所怀疑的。
    古今伟大的文艺作品，往往表现人性的庄严：在黑暗中追求光明，在困难中找出路，在压迫下挣扎而斗争，在危亡中表现不屈的勇敢和急切中的智慧。但是，在有些作品中，也常常表现为滑稽、诙谐和轻松的愉快。这些也是人情之常：在疲劳中需要短时间的欢笑，在绝望中需要寄托的快乐，在紧张的工作后需要放松一下胸怀。在戏台上，我们需要丑角，好的丑角可以使庄严的戏更庄严，悲剧更悲，喜剧更乐。
    我们常碰见一些不解风趣的人们，对于人家的笑话和诙谐以为是不严肃。这些人不知道笑，也不知道笑的好处，更不会欣赏打诨的智慧。古代有些道貌岸然的道学先生，并不一定是正经的；反之，太史公滑稽列传中的“倡优”人物，不乏有严肃的内心和敏捷的口辩之才，虽“善为笑言，然合于大道。”我从前对于北京的相声有些怀疑。但到底有许多人爱听，其中必有道理。我偶而也听了，确乎是有悠久的历史传统的。它能尖锐地反映现实。有些段子，是有意义的笑料，有些是有讽谏和教育作用的。即使有些纯属于可笑的，能引人发笑，也是一切勤劳的工作人员所需要的。
    人与人相处，无论是做朋友也好，谈正经事也好，也不可没有一点人情。我们中国人，过去有些不必要的人情，流于虚伪、矫作和无是非之感。但是对于我们日常相处的人，一天到晚一本正经地谈话，对于进行工作也有妨害。了解对方的人情，谈话中有人情，处理人的事有人的情，我想事情会更好办的。我们不欢迎“无事不登三宝殿”和“临时抱佛脚”的人，人与人之间应该在平时间有些说说笑笑的接触。在一次有好些老人家参加的座谈会上，我听到一位八十岁老人说他所理解的社会主义是“生活过得更好、人处得更好。”这些老先生们都主张有个同行的茶馆，可以聚会聚会，谈谈天，或许在自由谈天之中可以解决一些问题。严肃的开会，自由的茶座，都是需要的。我相信社会主义的大家庭里的生活应该更丰富些。
