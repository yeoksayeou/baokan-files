    Foot Doctor
    Zong Yu

    Some time ago, the big toe on my right foot was red, swollen, and festering, making it painful to walk. I went to the hospital to seek treatment for my foot, but the hospital had internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, dentistry, otolaryngology… many departments, but no podiatry department.

    I thought the problem with my foot might be closer to surgery, so I looked for a surgeon. The doctor looked at my red and swollen toe and said that it was already inflamed and festering inside, and I needed to have a few penicillin injections to reduce the inflammation. After three injections, it was not effective at all. I complained to the doctor, and the doctor said that the only option was surgery. First, I was afraid of surgery, and second, I didn't have much trust in this doctor, so I decided to seek medical treatment elsewhere.

    I went to a famous traditional Chinese medicine surgeon. This was an old gentleman who looked at my condition and said with certainty, "This problem can be solved by going to the bathhouse and finding a foot repairman. I guarantee you'll be fine immediately."

    What? Go to the bathhouse to get my feet fixed? I used to have minor foot problems that were cured by foot repairmen. This time it was so serious that I couldn't walk, and I was in so much pain that I couldn't sit or lie down. Could it really be fixed? I was a little skeptical. The old gentleman explained, "Foot repairmen can treat foot problems. They are very capable. I go to them when I have foot problems too." The old gentleman spoke very sincerely. Although I was still a little doubtful, I finally followed the old gentleman's instructions and went.

    I arrived at the bathhouse, took a quick shower, and asked for foot repair. Then, a middle-aged man with a bare back, broad chest, and sweat all over his face, dragging wooden clogs and carrying a small stool, walked towards me. Before I could speak, he sat down in front of me. He looked at my red and swollen toe and said with some complaint, "Why didn't you come sooner? It's gotten so bad." I told him that I had been to the hospital, had injections, and the doctor even wanted to operate on me, and asked him if he could cure it. He didn't say that the doctor was meddling, nor did he show that he was an expert. He said very kindly, "I can cure it." He pointed to the red and swollen toe and said, "This is because the nail is growing into the flesh." As he spoke, he unwrapped a cloth bundle and took out a small leather box, with more than a dozen small knives of different thicknesses inserted in it. This was his only tool. He gently picked up my foot and first trimmed the non-painful nails. I only focused on the red and swollen toe, hoping that he could really cure it with his skill.

    After he finished trimming the other nails, he changed to a thin knife and concentrated on slowly piercing the nail that was growing into the flesh. I was very nervous and asked him to go slower and slower. He comforted me and said, "It's too deep. Just bear with the pain and it will be fine." I held my breath and gritted my teeth. In less than a minute, he said with satisfaction, "Okay!" I couldn't believe it. He tried to pinch the painful spot with his hand and asked, "Does it still hurt?" I only felt relieved, but I still didn't trust my own senses. I pinched it myself, and it really didn't hurt! I stood on the ground and deliberately took a few steps. My foot was completely healed! At this moment, I couldn't help but feel grateful. I didn't know what to say, so I just exclaimed, "You are really a good doctor!"

    He smiled with satisfaction. While putting away the knives, he said, "It's enough that you don't hurt. I don't deserve to be called a doctor." His humble and honest demeanor made me feel somewhat inferior and uncomfortable. I hoped that he could completely forget the trauma of being demeaned as the lowest profession in the old society and talk about the situation of this profession.

    I wanted to know the origin of this profession because I had never seen any written records about it, but they themselves couldn't explain it clearly either. There was only a vague legend passed down orally that many years ago, there was a Taoist priest who walked every day, and his feet were worn out. He would use his iron staff to repair them, and then walk again. When they were worn out, he would repair them again. It was said that this was the origin of foot repair. Later generations called this Taoist priest the ancestor of foot repair, calling him "Cure Ancestor." As proof, there is a staff-shaped knife in every foot repair knife set. They became a family with the Taoist priest, helping each other in life.

    This was a matter of feudal society, a legend. The middle-aged man's foot repair knife set no longer had that staff-shaped knife. Foot problems and technological developments could no longer be solved by an iron staff. Instead, he was using more than a dozen good steel knives of different shapes and with different uses.

    Technically, it is said that foot repair is more difficult to learn than haircutting because there is skin on the head, while there is only an invisible thin membrane between the nail and the flesh. To be able to remove the nail without hurting the membrane and without bleeding at all is considered a good skill. This is truly no less than the skill of "the man of Ying wielding the axe," nor is it weaker than the accuracy and meticulousness required for Western medicine to perform abdominal surgery.

    However, what are some common foot problems, and can all of them be treated? He said, "There are many foot problems - ingrown nails, overlapping toes, hammer toes, extra toes, corns, calluses… Your nail growing into the flesh is called 'ingrown nail'. There are several types of 'corns' and 'calluses'. Foot repairmen can cure them all."

    Who has the most foot problems? He said: People who wear small shoes, leather shoes, women who wear high heels, people who walk a lot, and ballet dancers have the most foot problems. The year before last, when the Moscow Grand Theatre came to Beijing to perform, our colleagues repaired the feet of many of their famous actors.

    Speaking of ballet, the light and graceful dance姿态, especially the soft and rippling feet like flower buds, bring so much happiness and joy to people. I never thought that those flower-bud-like feet would have any problems, let alone that they would have anything to do with foot repair. So, this aroused my interest in further inquiry.

    I learned that the person who repaired the feet of the Soviet ballet dancers was Lu Heng from the Xisi Bathhouse. It is said that in the winter of 1954, when the Moscow Musical Theatre of the Soviet Union came to Beijing to perform famous plays such as "Swan Lake" and "Notre Dame de Paris," many calluses and blisters had formed on the tips of those flower-bud-like toes. They invited Lu Heng to their residence. At first, Lu Heng didn't understand why the problems were all on the toes. When asked why, they immediately danced and rippled in front of Lu Heng as an answer. Lu Heng was pleasantly surprised, rolled up his sleeves, and took the knife to carefully repair their feet. In a moment, he made their feet even softer and lighter. Later, Lu Heng watched their formal performance and admired the wonderful and light feet that he had personally repaired even more. From then on, Lu Heng became the foot doctor repeatedly invited by the actors and also became a friend. A few hours before they returned to their country by train, two more actors asked Lu Heng to repair their feet one last time. They greatly praised Lu Heng's skill in foot repair.

    After hearing these stories, I felt that I had been too ignorant in the past. It is said that there are more than three hundred foot repairmen in the nearly eighty bathhouses in Beijing, and they treat tens of thousands of people for foot diseases every year. Who can say that this profession is not important? It is a pity that no apprentices have been recruited in recent years, and it is a pity that this skill has not been valued. They only charge 26 cents for each successful repair of a diseased foot, regardless of the severity of the disease, while a regular registration at the hospital costs 30 cents, which is a bit unfair.

    修脚医生
    宗禹
    前些时，我右脚拇指红肿会脓，疼得寸步难行。我到医院，请求医脚，但是医院里有的是内科、外科、眼科、牙科、耳鼻喉科……许多科门，却没有脚科。
    我想脚上的毛病，也许比较接近外科，便找了外科医生。医生看了看我红肿的脚指，说里面已经发炎会脓，需要打几针盘尼西林消消炎。打过三针，丝毫无效。我向医生诉苦，医生说那只有开刀了。我一来怕开刀，二来对这位医生已不大信任，决定另行求医。
    我去找有名的中医外科医生，这是一位老先生，看看我的病情，肯定地说：“这毛病去澡堂找到修脚的同志，保证你立刻就好。”
    怎么？要我去澡堂修脚？从前我脚上有过小毛病是找修脚的治好的。这次是严重到不能走路，已疼得坐卧不安，难道还能修好吗？我有些怀疑。老先生解释说：“脚上的病修脚的同志都能治，他们很有本领，我脚上有病也是找到他们的。”老先生说得非常诚恳，我虽然还有一点半信半疑，终于遵照老先生的指点去了。
    来到澡堂，简单洗个澡，要求修脚。接着，一位赤背宽胸、汗流满面的中年人，拖着木履，带着小凳，向我走来。没等我开口，便在我面前坐下。看看我红肿的脚指，有些埋怨似地说：“怎么不早来，弄得这样厉害了。”我告诉他去过医院，打过针，医生还想给我开刀，问他能治不能治。他既不说那位医生多事，也没有显露出他是能手的神情，很和善地说：“能治。”他点着那个红肿的脚指说：“这是指甲弯进肉里了。”一边说一边解布包，取出一个小皮匣，上面插着十多把粗细不同的小裁刀。这就是他唯一的工具。他温和地拿起我的脚，先照着不疼的指甲修，我只注视着那个红肿的脚指，祈望他能以真的手到病除。
    他修完别的指甲，换了把细刀，聚精会神地照着弯进肉里的指甲慢慢刺去，我十分紧张，要求慢点再慢点。他安慰我说：“太深了，忍一下疼就好了。”我闭住气、咬住牙，不到一分钟工夫，他满意地说：“好了！”我有点不相信，他试着用手照疼处一捏，问道：“还疼吗？”我只觉得轻松，但还不相信自己的知觉，自己用手去捏，确实不疼了！立在地上，故意踏了几步，完全成了好脚！这时，我不禁涌上一阵感激心情，不知说什么是好，只叫了声：“你真是好医生！”
    他满意地微笑着。一边收拾刀子，一边说：“使你不疼就行了，称不上医生。”他那谦逊忠厚的神态，使我感到带有自卑，不大舒服。我希望他能完全忘记被旧社会贬为最低下职业的创伤，谈谈这门职业的情况。
    我想知道这门职业的来历，因为从来没有看到过文字记载，可是他们自己也说不清楚。只是口头上有一个模糊的传说，许多年前，有位道士，每天走路，脚磨坏，便用自己的铁禅修一修，修好了再走，走坏了又修，说这便是修脚的起源。后人把这位道士称为修脚的祖师——称作“治祖”。以后的修脚刀中都有一把禅形刀为证。与道士成了一家人，生活上互相帮助。
    这是封建社会的事情，是传说，中年人使用的修脚刀中，已没有那把禅形刀了。脚上的毛病和技术上的发展，早不是铁禅所能解决了，而是使用着十多把形状不同各有用处的好钢刀。
    在技术上，据说，修脚比理发还要难学一些，因为头上有皮，指甲和肉之间只有一层无形的薄膜，要能去掉指甲不刺伤薄膜，不流一点血，才算好本领。这真不亚于“郢人运斧”的本领，也不弱于西医开肠破肚所需要的准确与细心。
    但是，脚上都有一些什么毛病，是否都能治脚呢？他说：“脚上的毛病很多——嵌指、顶指、盖指、加指、脚垫、鸡眼……你这指甲弯进肉里就叫做‘嵌指’，‘鸡眼’、‘脚垫’都有好几种，修脚的全都能治。”
    哪些人脚上毛病最多呢？他说：穿小鞋、穿皮鞋、妇女穿高跟鞋、走路多的和跳巴蕾舞的人脚上毛病最多。前年莫斯科大剧院来北京演出时，我们的同行就修过她们许多名演员的脚。
    提起巴蕾舞，那轻妙如飞的舞姿，特别是那柔和荡漾犹如花苞似的双脚，给人们带来多少幸福和愉快。我万万没有想到那花苞似的双脚会有什么毛病，更不会想到她和修脚的有什么关系。所以引起我进一步探问的兴趣。
    我打听到给苏联巴蕾舞演员修脚的是西四浴池的鲁亨。据说：1954年的冬天，苏联莫斯科音乐剧院来北京演出“天鹅湖”、“巴黎圣母院”等名剧时，那一朵朵花苞似的脚尖上，磨了许多茧泡。她们把鲁亨请到寓所。最初鲁亨不懂毛病为什么全在脚尖上。问起来由，她们立刻在鲁亨面前飞舞荡漾了一番，作为解答。鲁亨惊喜，卷袖拿刀，为她们精心修理。片刻，使得她们的双脚更加柔和轻快了。后来，鲁亨看了她们的正式演出，对他亲手修理的美妙如飞的双脚更加爱慕。从此，鲁亨成了演员们多次邀请的修脚医生，也成了朋友。当她们回国上火车前几小时，还有两位演员请鲁亨修了一次脚。她们对鲁亨修脚的本领大为赞扬。
    我听了这些故事，觉得自己过去太孤陋寡闻了。据说北京市的近八十家澡堂里，有三百多个修脚医生，一年中总要为好几万人医治脚病，谁能说这行职业不重要吗？可惜近几年来没有收过一个学徒，可惜这门技术还没有得到重视。他们每修好一次病脚，不管病的轻重只收二角六分钱，而医院挂一个普通号就得三角，未免有些不公平吧。
