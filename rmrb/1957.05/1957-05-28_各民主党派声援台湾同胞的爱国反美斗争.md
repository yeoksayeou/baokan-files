Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Responsible figures from various democratic parties made speeches or published written statements on Central People's Broadcasting Station tonight, unanimously expressing support for the patriotic anti-American struggle of Taiwan compatriots.

Those who made speeches or published written statements on Central People's Broadcasting Station included Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman; Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member; Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League; Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Huang Qixiang, Executive Bureau Member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party; Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party; and Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society.

In her speech, Xie Xuehong first expressed her deep sympathy, condolences, and support to the Taiwan compatriots on behalf of the Taiwanese people on the mainland. She expressed particular condolences to the families of the victims. She said that the incident of American soldiers killing Liu Ziran was just one of the thousands of crimes committed by the American aggressors who run rampant and do all kinds of evil in Taiwan. The Taiwan people have every reason to rise up and resist for their own survival. This is just and patriotic, and the people of the whole country admire the heroic struggle of the Taiwan people.

Xie Xuehong pointed out that for several years, American aggressors have been occupying China's territory of Taiwan by force, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and oppressing and bullying the Taiwan people, making their lives even more miserable than those of cattle and horses. Recently, the US government, in order to further invade China and permanently occupy Taiwan, announced the deployment of air force units equipped with missiles in China's territory of Taiwan. The people of the whole country are extremely indignant at the recklessness of the United States, and our government has also lodged strong protests.

Xie Xuehong also said that the Taiwan people, like the people of the whole country, have a revolutionary tradition of opposing imperialist aggression and a glorious history of fighting against imperialist aggression for decades. We will never tolerate imperialist aggression. We must unite and drive out the American aggressors. I am determined to work with the Taiwan compatriots to fight to the end to drive out the American aggressors.

Li Jishen pointed out in his speech that the Taiwan compatriots' anger in destroying the American "Embassy" in Taiwan shows the world that the Taiwan compatriots have reached the point of being unable to tolerate the American aggressors' heinous crimes of obstructing Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland and wantonly trampling on the Taiwan people.

Li Jishen called on compatriots at home and abroad and fair-minded people all over the world to unanimously support the just struggle of our Taiwan compatriots and resolutely stop the American aggressors from further persecuting our Taiwan compatriots. He said that the flame of patriotism can never be extinguished. The anti-American demonstration by patriotic masses in Taipei is only the beginning of the Taiwan people's practical actions. Any suppression or allowing American imperialism to continue to occupy Taiwan will only arouse greater anger among the Taiwan people and lead to more intense actions. All conscientious military and political personnel in Taiwan will also share the same hatred and rise up to resist. If the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities are unwilling to continue to be foreign lackeys and massacre their own compatriots, they should avenge the Taiwan people and drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan!

Zhang Zhizhong said that the patriotic actions of the Taiwan people embody the national self-esteem and sense of justice that Chinese people should have and are not accidental. The Taiwan people's hatred of Americans to the bone is the inevitable result of all the crimes committed by the United States after its occupation of Taiwan. In his speech, Zhang Zhizhong also warned all Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan that through this incident, you should, on the one hand, recognize the conspiracies and extreme wickedness of American imperialism, and on the other hand, you should also see the inner psychology and grievances of the Taiwan people. The US conspiracy to create two Chinas, to place Taiwan under trusteeship, and to strengthen its direct control over Taiwan will not stop. And the anti-American resistance force of the Taiwan people cannot be suppressed. In the future, you can only resolve to get rid of American shackles, realize the aspirations of the Taiwan people, and act together for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the reunification of the motherland.

Shao Lizi said that American imperialism has occupied China's Taiwan and enslaved the compatriots in Taiwan for eight years! There have been countless acts of robbery like the killing of Liu Ziran. The Taiwan compatriots have run out of tears, their blood has dried up, and now they can no longer tolerate it! In front of the American missile troops who killed people, a struggle of resistance to the death broke out, showing steel-like strength! He also said that the people of the motherland are the most peace-loving, but when it comes to being unbearable, they will resolutely fight the aggressors to the death. Peace-loving people all over the world stand with us, and in order to defend our territory, defend our people, and defend peace in the Far East and the world, we will demand the aggressors to pay their blood debts!

Luo Longji said that the incident of American soldier Reynolds shooting and killing Liu Ziran is by no means an accidental or coincidental event. It is commonplace for imperialists in colonial and semi-colonial countries to kill without paying for their lives and rape without committing crimes. In the eyes of imperialists, this is the law of slave owners dealing with slaves. He also said that after the US military court declared Reynolds himself innocent, Ye Gongchao of the Chiang Kai-shek group actually requested the US military court to retry the case, thinking that this act of begging the United States could quell the anti-American anger of the Taiwan compatriots. Ye Gongchao should know that requesting a foreign court to exercise judicial power on Chinese territory is itself an act of treason. After the Taiwan compatriots, out of righteous indignation, destroyed the US Embassy in Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek group immediately sent Dong XianGuang to the US State Department to "apologize" ..., what a shameful thing, what a disgrace to our great Chinese nation!

Huang Yanpei, on behalf of the 25,000 members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, most of whom are industrialists and businessmen, and some are overseas Chinese, expressed support for the patriotic anti-American struggle of the Taiwan compatriots. He said that in the eight years since liberation, our motherland has made unprecedented progress in politics, economy, and culture, and is now marching on the glorious socialist road. However, Taiwan, a part of our country's sacred territory, is still under American occupation today, in darkness, and simply a hell on earth. And the devil of this hell is American imperialism. He also said that we must solemnly tell American imperialism: the Chinese people cannot tolerate this atrocity, and we must demand that they hand over the murderer to be punished according to the law. We must also warn American imperialism: blood debts must be repaid in blood. We must also solemnly tell the Taiwan local authorities that they should recognize the distinction between the enemy and us on this major issue and fully support the just actions of the Taiwan people. If they act as accomplices and help American imperialism, they will be isolating themselves from the people.

Xu Guangping, on behalf of all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, expressed strong protest against the American aggressors' atrocities of invading our territory Taiwan and massacring our people, and expressed firm support for the patriotic actions of the Taiwan compatriots. She said that the American aggressors' massacre of Chinese people is the deepest memory of the Chinese people. Before liberation, the Shen Chong incident occurred in Beijing, and Zang Daerzi in Shanghai was also killed by the US military. These are also the inevitable results of the Chiang Kai-shek group's kowtowing to the American aggressors. Today, we can no longer see imperious imperialists on the mainland. Anyone who violates our laws will be punished by our laws. Now, the American aggressors are still repeating the crimes before liberation on our territory Taiwan. Every compatriot on the mainland is extremely angry!

Huang Qixiang said that the era when imperialism could arbitrarily run amok in China is over. The people of Taiwan are indomitable. Taiwan and China are inseparable. All of us Chinese people care about the fate of our Taiwan compatriots, and we will use all means to support their just struggle against aggression.

In his speech, Chen Qiyou warned the American aggressors: disregarding the opposition of the people of our country and the peace-loving people of the world, you have occupied our territory of Taiwan by force, treated our compatriots in Taiwan as worthless cattle and horses, and wantonly trampled on them; recently, you have also dispatched missile troops to be stationed there, and conspired to make Taiwan implement so-called trusteeship, in order to turn Taiwan into an atomic base for aggression in Asia. This not only hinders the integrity and reunification of our country's territory, threatens our country's security, but also seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world. If the American aggressors do not get out of Taiwan for one day, our Taiwan compatriots and the people of the whole of China will not give up for one day. In the future, those who will suffer the consequences will still be the American aggressors themselves.

Xu Deheng said that he believes that the heroic and patriotic eight million Taiwan compatriots, under the intimidating power of American imperialism, will surely be able to unite and drive the American imperialist forces out of Taiwan, and work together with the 600 million compatriots across the country to liberate Taiwan and realize the complete reunification of the country!

    各民主党派声援台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争
    新华社27日讯　各民主党派负责人今晚分别在中央人民广播电台发表谈话或发表书面谈话，一致声援台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争。
    在中央人民广播电台发表谈话或发表书面谈话的，有台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红，中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、副主席张治中、常务委员邵力子，中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培，中国民主促进会副主席许广平，中国农工民主党中央执行局委员黄琪翔，中国致公党主席陈其尤，九三学社主席许德珩。
    谢雪红在谈话中首先代表在大陆上的台湾人民向台湾同胞表示万分的同情、慰问和支持。特别对被害的家属表示慰问。她说，美国军人杀害刘自然的事件不过是美国侵略者在台湾横行霸道、无恶不作的千万罪行中的一件，台湾人民为了自己的生存，完全有理由起来进行反抗，这是正义的、爱国的，全国人民都对台湾人民的英勇斗争表示敬佩。
    谢雪红指出，几年来美国侵略者武装占领中国的领土台湾，阻碍中国人民解放台湾，压迫欺负台湾人民，使台湾人民一直到现在还在过着比牛马更凄惨的生活。最近美国政府为进一步侵略中国，永远霸占台湾，宣布在中国领土台湾驻扎装备导弹的空军部队，全国人民都对美国的乱来极其愤慨，我国政府也已经提出了强烈的抗议。
    谢雪红又说，台湾人民同全国人民一样有着反对帝国主义侵略的革命传统，并且有着几十年同帝国主义进行反侵略斗争的光荣历史。我们决不容忍帝国主义的侵略，我们大家要团结起来，把美国侵略者赶出去。我决心同台湾同胞一起，为赶走美国侵略者而共同奋斗到底。
    李济深在谈话中指出，台湾同胞愤怒捣毁美国驻台“大使馆”，向全世界表明我台湾同胞对美国侵略者阻挠台湾归回祖国怀抱、任意蹂躏台湾人民的滔天罪行，已经到了忍无可忍的地步。
    李济深要求国内外同胞和全世界公正人士一致声援我台湾同胞的正义斗争，坚决制止美国侵略者对我台湾同胞作任何进一步的迫害。他说，爱国的火焰是永远扑灭不了的。台北爱国群众反美大示威，不过是台湾人民实际行动的开始，采取任何镇压手段或者让美帝国主义继续霸占台湾，只能激起台湾人民更大的愤怒，采取更激烈的行动。台湾所有有良心的军政人员，也必然会和爱国同胞敌忾同仇，一齐起来反抗。台湾国民党当局如果不愿继续充当异族鹰犬、屠杀自己同胞，就应当为台湾人民报仇雪恨，把美国侵略者赶出台湾去！
    张治中说，台湾人民的爱国行动体现了中国人应有的民族自尊心和正义感，不是偶然的。台湾人民对美国恨入骨髓的情绪，是美国侵占台湾以后所有一切罪行的必然结果。张治中在谈话中还正告台湾全体国民党军政人员说，通过这一次事件，你们应该一方面认清楚美帝国主义的阴谋诡计与穷凶极恶，另一方面还应该看到台湾人民的内在心理与怨愤呼声。美国的阴谋如想搞两个中国，又想托管台湾，加强对台湾的直接控制，是不会停止的。而台湾人民恨美仇美的反抗力量是不可压制的。你们今后只有决心摆脱美国的束缚，实现台湾人民的愿望，为和平解放台湾，完成祖国的统一而共同行动。
    邵力子说，美帝国主义霸占中国的台湾，奴役台湾的同胞已经八年了！像杀死刘自然的强盗行为，不知多少。台湾同胞们泪干了，血枯了，现在忍无可忍了！就在美国杀人的导弹部队面前，爆发了誓死反抗的斗争，显示了钢铁一般的力量！他又说，祖国人民是最爱好和平的，但是到了无可忍耐的时候，就会毅然决然和侵略者一拚生死。全世界爱好和平的人民都站在我们一起，为着保卫领土，保卫人民，保卫远东和世界和平，我们会要向侵略者讨还血债的！
    罗隆基说，美国士兵雷诺枪杀刘自然这样的事件绝对不是意外的或者偶然的事件，帝国主义者在殖民地和半殖民地国家杀人不抵命、强奸不犯罪，这是帝国主义者在殖民地和半殖民地国家习以为常的事情。在帝国主义者看来，这就是奴隶主对待奴隶的法律。他又说，在美国军事法庭宣判雷诺本人无罪以后，蒋介石集团的叶公超居然请求美国军事法庭重审，他以为这种向美国乞怜的行为可以平息台湾同胞反美的愤怒情绪。叶公超应该知道，在中国的领土上请求外国的法庭来行使司法权，这本身就是卖国的罪行。台湾同胞激于义愤把美国驻台湾大使馆捣毁以后，蒋介石集团竟然立即派董显光到美国国务院去“请罪”“道歉”……，这是多么可耻的事情，这是多么玷辱我堂堂中华民族的事情！
    黄炎培代表中国民主建国会两万五千位会员，他们大部分是工商业家，一部分是侨胞，对台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争表示支持。他说，解放八年，我们的祖国无论在政治、经济和文化上，都有了史无前例的发展，现在，正在光辉灿烂的社会主义大道上迈进。而我们国家神圣领土的一部分——台湾，到今天还在美国霸占之下，暗无天日，简直是人间地狱。而这座地狱的魔王就是美帝国主义。他又说，我们要严正地告诉美帝国主义：中国人民不能忍受这种暴行，我们必须要求他们交出杀人犯依法处罪。我们还要警告美帝国主义：血债必须用血来偿还。我们也要正告台湾地方当局，在这种大关大节上应当认清敌我界限，全力支持台湾人民的正义行动。如果为虎作伥，做美帝国主义的帮凶，那就是自绝于人民。
    许广平代表中国民主促进会全体会员对美国侵略者侵占我国领土台湾和屠杀我国人民的暴行提出强烈的抗议，对台湾同胞的爱国行动表示坚决的支持。她说，美国侵略者屠杀中国人民，在中国人民中记忆最深。解放前，北京曾发生过沈崇事件，上海的臧大二子也是美军杀死的。这些也都是蒋介石集团对美国侵略者奴颜婢膝的必然结果。今天在大陆上再也看不到为所欲为的帝国主义分子了，违反我国法律的任何人，都要受我国法律的制裁。现在美国侵略者竟然还在我国的领土台湾重犯解放前的罪行，我们在大陆上的每一个同胞无不愤慨万分！
    黄琪翔说，帝国主义可以任意在中国横行的时代已经过去了。台湾人民是不可屈的。台湾和中国是不可分的。我们全中国人民关怀着台湾同胞的命运，我们将用尽一切方法支援他们反抗侵略的正义的斗争。
    陈其尤在谈话中警告美国侵略者：你们不顾我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的反对，以武力霸占我国的领土台湾，对我们台湾的同胞视如草芥牛马，随意加以蹂躏；最近还派遣了导弹部队驻在那里，并阴谋使台湾实行所谓托管，以便把台湾变为侵略亚洲的原子基地。这不仅妨碍着我国领土的完整和统一，威胁着我国的安全，而且也严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。美国侵略者一日不滚出台湾，我们台湾同胞和全中国人民即一日不干休，将来食其恶果者还是美国侵略者自己。
    许德珩说，相信英勇的、爱国的八百万台湾同胞，在美帝的侵略淫威之下，一定能够团结起来，把美帝侵略势力从台湾驱逐出去，和全国六万万同胞一起，为解放台湾，实现全国的完全统一而奋斗！
