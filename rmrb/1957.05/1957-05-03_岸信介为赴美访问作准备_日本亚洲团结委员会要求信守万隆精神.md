Xinhua News Agency report: The Japanese Committee for Asian Solidarity passed an appeal at its Standing Committee meeting on April 30, requesting Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to consult with leaders of Asian countries based on the Bandung Spirit to enhance mutual understanding, friendship, and academic and cultural exchanges.

The committee also requested that Nobusuke Kishi, who will be visiting Asian countries and the United States, make the greatest effort to enhance mutual understanding and cooperation with countries that hold different positions from Japan. It also hopes that Nobusuke Kishi can reach a consensus with Asian leaders on the issue of restoring China's representation in the United Nations and the issue of collective security guarantees in the Pacific region. At the same time, it hopes that when Nobusuke Kishi visits the United States, he should use the conclusions reached through consultations with Asian leaders as his attitude when discussing various issues with the United States.

Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said at a meeting of Liberal Democratic Party leaders on the 2nd that he is preparing to reorganize the cabinet and replace the leadership of the ruling party after visiting the United States. He said that he intends to adopt new policies and establish new institutions by integrating what he has learned from his visits to various countries.

The various factions within the Japanese ruling party have differences regarding the cabinet reshuffle. It is expected that Nobusuke Kishi will consolidate the position of the Kishi faction by reorganizing the government and the party.

The Japanese "National Defense Council" held a meeting on the 2nd to discuss the basic policy of Japan's national defense in order to prepare for the meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and US leaders in June.

According to Kyodo News, this highest military decision-making body emphasized in its discussion that Japan's "defense" cannot rely solely on Japan's strength, and in principle agreed to cooperate more closely with "free countries," especially with the United States, under the United Nations' "collective security system." It also agreed in principle that the Japanese army should "defend against direct or indirect aggression" and can be dispatched to "maintain public order" when necessary. On the issue of expanding the military, the "National Defense Council" agreed in principle to expand the military according to Japan's strength and conditions.

    岸信介为赴美访问作准备
    日本亚洲团结委员会要求信守万隆精神
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：日本亚洲团结委员会在4月30日举行的常任理事会会议上通过了一封呼吁书，要求日本首相岸信介根据万隆精神同亚洲各国领袖商谈增进相互间的了解、友好和学术文化等方面的交流问题。
    委员会还要求将到亚洲各国和美国访问的岸信介尽最大努力增进同日本立场不同的国家的相互了解和合作。并且希望岸信介在中国恢复在联合国中的代表权问题和太平洋地区的集体安全保障问题上，也能同亚洲各国的领袖取得一致意见。同时希望岸信介访问美国时，应当以同亚洲各国领袖进行商谈而取得的结论作为自己的态度，同美国进行各种问题的商谈。
    日本首相岸信介2日在自由民主党的首脑会议上说，他准备在访问美国以后改组内阁和更换执政党的领导干部。他说，他打算结合到各国访问学到的东西采取新的政策和建立新的机构。
    日本执政党内部各派系对于改组内阁问题存有分歧。预料岸信介将通过改组政府和党来巩固岸派的地位。
    日本“国防会议”2日开会讨论了日本国防的基本方针，以便为日本首相岸信介6月间同美国首脑举行的会谈进行准备。
    据共同社透露，这个最高的军事决策机构在讨论中强调日本的“防御”光依靠日本的力量不行，而在原则上同意要在联合国的“集体安全体系”下同“自由国家”特别是同美国更紧密地合作，并且还在原则上同意，日本军队要“防御直接或者间接的侵略”，在必要时可以出动“维持公共秩序”。在扩军问题上，“国防会议”原则上同意要根据日本的力量和条件来扩充军队。
