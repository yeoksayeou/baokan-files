    Writers Association Party Group Listens to Criticism from Non-Party Writers
    (Our Newspaper) In order to hear criticisms and opinions from non-Party writers regarding the China Writers Association and the leadership of literary work, the Writers Association Party Group held its first symposium on the afternoon of the 22nd. Non-Party writers Ye Shengtao, Chen Mengjia, Huang Yaomian, Zhong Jingwen, Zhang Henshui, Zang Kejia, Wang Jingzhi, and Mao Dun attended and spoke at the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Shao Quanlin, Secretary of the Writers Association Party Group, and Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Xiao San, Liu Baiyu, Guo Xiaochuan, and others attended the meeting.
    The comrades who spoke discussed the relationship between the Writers Association and writers. Ye Shengtao believed that the Writers Association is a people's organization, and its purpose should be to unite writers, connect feelings, and discuss issues (such as creation and business), but this aspect has not been done well enough. He disagreed with the Writers Association having a leadership relationship with writers. Chen Mengjia felt that joining the association was not easy, and the Writers Association's bureaucracy was strong. It should be a people's organization in name and reality, which would facilitate exchanges between writers. Some other speakers also felt that the Writers Association had an air of officialdom. Mao Dun said that the Writers Association is composed of freelance writers, but it is different from general trade associations. Trade associations are open to anyone in the same industry, but joining the Writers Association requires introduction and approval, and one must be recognized as a writer. He said that it is impossible to find a Writers Association like a trade association in the world; it can be said that the Writers Association has the nature of both a trade association and a learned society. He believed that the task of the Writers Association should be to assist the government in carrying out literary movements and implementing literary policies under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past, the Writers Association has done this work, but it has neglected another task, namely, seeking welfare for writers. Therefore, it seems that the Writers Association is like a government office, and a few leaders of the Writers Association have become the rulers of the writers, while the members have become "ordinary writer citizens." To change this situation, it is necessary to change the working methods of the Writers Association.
    The most heatedly discussed issue was the relationship between Party member writers and non-Party member writers. Zhong Jingwen compared the wall between the two to a glass wall, where they can see each other, but it is out of reach. He said that as a director of the Writers Association, and even a standing director for a period of time, he still had no effect. After the Writers Association elected the directors at the meeting, he became "a stranger ever after," just a name without substance. He said that some Party member writers were as close as family to non-Party writers and called each other brothers before liberation, but now they avoid non-Party writers as if they were lepers. He hoped that the contradictions between the Party and the masses in the Writers Association should be like the contradictions between members of the same family, and not be regarded as outsiders, which would make it easier to solve. Huang Yaomian said that some Party members regard intellectuals as petty bourgeois, a pitch-black mass, and avoid them, which is not good. Avoiding is not the solution, and it can be said that it is a lack of Party spirit. In the Investiture of the Gods, only the gods with low magic power dare not touch the demons. Those with a demon-revealing mirror are not afraid. He said that in the past, some Party members really lacked Party spirit and were domineering. It seems that being a Party member is like being an official, and Party members do everything themselves without letting go. In their work, they repeatedly promote young Party members, which is not good for young Party members or old non-Party writers. Zang Kejia also felt that Party member writers used to be much closer to him, but now they are distant. However, this is not entirely the case. He said that he still has a deep friendship with some Party member writers, such as Guo Xiaochuan, and they talk about everything.
    When talking about the sectarianism and bureaucratism of the Writers Association, Wang Jingzhi excitedly criticized some comrades in the People's Literature Publishing House for suppressing him, which led to his departure from the publishing house, based on his personal experience. He said that fortunately, he received the help of the Writers Association, which enabled him to live and write. He believed that the Writers Association's loan method is good, but the method still needs to be improved, and he hoped to take more care of writers with fewer works and lower royalties, such as poets. Zhang Henshui spoke on behalf of the writers of episodic novels, asking for attention to be paid to episodic novels. He said that in the past, writing episodic novels was considered indecent. Now it is slightly more valued, but apart from him, no other episodic novelist is a member of the Writers Association. Mr. Chen Shenyan, who is seventy years old and very knowledgeable, is still not a member, which is worth considering. Chen Mengjia was very grateful to the Writers Association for rediscovering him like a cultural relic, but what was unpleasant was that he was still labeled with the hat of the "Crescent Moon Society." He said that he was still a teenager at the time and did not understand any factions. He was close to both the Crescent Moon Society poets and the left-wing writers.
    When talking about the Writers Association's ideological work on literature and art, Huang Yaomian believed that the Writers Association had not clarified the characteristics of the literary cause. In the past, it one-sidedly emphasized class nature and ignored individuality, feeling, and style. The Writers Association's leadership work also had the shortcomings of lacking political sensitivity and not closely connecting with the masses. The Writers Association only took care of the front-end work and ignored the back-end work. Ye Shengtao said that in the past, the Writers Association talked too much about theory in creation, and these theories were divorced from life and practice. As a result, it created the illusion that some young people thought that they must learn theory before they can create, and even elementary school teachers must analyze the theme and typical characters of the works before teaching, in order to show progress.
    Shao Quanlin finally expressed his gratitude to everyone on behalf of the Party Group of the Association. He especially apologized to Wang Jingzhi, saying that he did not know about this matter at all, which is another example of bureaucratism.
    This symposium will continue to be held.

### 作家协会党组听取非党作家的批评

    作家协会党组听取非党作家的批评
    本报讯　为了听取党外作家对中国作家协会和文艺工作领导方面的批评和意见，作协党组在22日下午召开了第一次的座谈会。到会的党外作家叶圣陶、陈梦家、黄药眠、钟敬文、张恨水、臧克家、汪静之、茅盾，他们在会上都发了言。会议由作协党组书记邵荃麟主持，周扬、丁玲、萧三、刘白羽、郭小川等都出席了这次会议。
    发言的同志讨论了作协和作家的关系问题。叶圣陶认为作协是人民团体，宗旨应该是团结作家、联络感情、商量问题（创作、业务方面等），但这一方面做得不够。他不同意作协对作家是领导关系。陈梦家感到入会不易，作协机关气浓厚，应该名副其实地是一个人民团体，才便于作家与作家之间的交往。另外一些发言者也觉得作协有衙门气。茅盾说，作协是自由职业者的作家组成的，但和一般同业公会不同。同业公会是凡同一行业者都可加入，而加入作协却要经过介绍和批准，被承认是作家才行。他说，世上还找不出一个像同业公会那样的作协；可以说，作协既带有同业公会的性质，又具有学会的性质。他认为作协的任务应该是在共产党领导下，辅助政府开展文学运动，贯彻文艺政策。过去作协是做了这一方面的工作，但忽略了另一方面的任务，即为作家谋福利。因此看起来作协像个衙门，作协少数领导者成为作家的统治者，而会员成为“作家老百姓”了。要改变这种状况，就要改变作协的工作方法。
    谈得热烈的问题是党员作家和非党员作家的关系。钟敬文把两者之间的一道墙比作玻璃墙，彼此看得见，却可望而不可即。他说，他身为作协理事之一，有个时期还是常务理事，但照样不起作用，自作协开会选出理事后，从此“萧郎成陌路”，有名无实了。他说，有些党员作家在解放前作地下工作时同党外作家亲如家人，称兄道弟；现在避开党外作家好像避开麻疯病人似的。他希望作协党群之间的矛盾要像同一家庭里的成员之间的矛盾一样，不要看作是外人，就易于解决。黄药眠说，有些党员把知识分子一概看作是小资产阶级，是漆黑一团，远而避之，这不好。避开不是办法，可以说是党性不足。封神榜里只有自己法术不高的神仙才不敢接触妖怪。有照妖镜的，是不害怕的。他说，过去有些党员实在是党性不足，而党气凌人。好像做党员就是做官一样，什么都党员自己搞，不放手。在工作中把年青的党员一再加以提拔，这对青年党员和非党老作家都没有好处。臧克家也认为党员作家从前和他亲密得多，现在见外了。不过也不全如此，他说他和某些党员作家如郭小川，现在仍是交谊深厚，无话不谈。
    在谈到作协有宗派主义、官僚主义问题时，汪静之以亲身经历激动地批评人民文学出版社有的同志打击他以致使他离开出版社的情况。他说，幸而得到作协的帮助，使他能够生活和写作。他认为作协贷款办法是好，但办法还要改进，希望多照顾作品少稿费少的作家，例如写诗的人。张恨水在发言中替章回小说家呼吁，要求重视章回小说，他说过去写章回小说被认为是下流的事，现在稍稍重视了，但除他之外，没有第二个章回小说家是作协会员，年纪七十很有学问的陈慎言先生也还不是，实在值得考虑。陈梦家很感谢作协把他像文物似的重新发掘了出来，但不愉快的是还给他戴着“新月派”的帽子。他说其实他当时还是少年，不懂什么派别，既和新月派诗人接近，也和左翼作家接近的。
    谈到作协的文艺思想工作，黄药眠认为作协对文学事业的特点没有弄清，过去片面地强调了阶级性，而忽略了个性、感觉和风格等。作协的领导工作也有缺乏政治敏感性和联系群众不密切的缺点。作协只管做前台工作，忽视后台工作。叶圣陶说，作协在创作上过去讲理论多了些，而这些理论又是脱离生活脱离实践的东西。结果使人造成错觉，有些青年人以为必须先学理论才能创作，甚至小学教师教课也要先分析作品主题思想、典型人物，以示进步。
    邵荃麟最后代表协会党组向大家表示感谢。他特别向汪静之致歉，他说，他根本不知道这件事，这是官僚主义的又一例。
    这个座谈会将继续举行。
