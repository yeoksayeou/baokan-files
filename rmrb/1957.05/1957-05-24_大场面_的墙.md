    The Wall of "Grand Occasions"
    Lao Yunong

    In early 1943, as a minor cadre, I went to the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army to discuss a transfer of work. One morning, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng invited me to eat with him. The dishes were simple: a plate of scrambled eggs, two vegetarian dishes, and a small hot pot of vermicelli soup. After I finished eating and put down my chopsticks, Commander Peng solemnly said, "Comrade, have some more soup, this is chicken soup!"

    In the evening, we talked about work in his small bedroom. After extremely serious inquiries and instructions, he said, "Don't leave yet, I want to treat you to something extremely precious"; he took an iron box from a wooden chest, "This is cocoa, which Zuo Quan seized from the Japanese devils and gave to me two years ago." Then, without addressing me directly, he murmured: "Alas, seeing your relics makes me sad…!" It was an extremely sentimental tone.

    Comrade Zuo Quan was the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. In June 1942, he heroically sacrificed his life in a battle against the enemy's "Great Sweep."

    I had long been aware of Commander Peng's hard work and simplicity, so I wasn't surprised by his emphasis on chicken soup; what was strange was the very deep human touch he revealed in the matter of chicken soup and cocoa. Because of this human touch, I felt infinite warmth in his extremely serious instructions.

    I often pay attention to the many noble qualities of the leaders, but I am hindered by my own bad habits, and although my heart aspires to them, I cannot actually achieve them. I only have some confidence in enduring hardship and poverty, and I have not been intimidated by difficult environments for twenty years.

    After the national liberation, I worked as a leader in a small unit for several years. I made many mistakes in my work and finally collapsed, giving way to the worthy. Later people, in view of my mistakes, went the opposite way, which is naturally correct. But there is one thing that I cannot accept. When I was there, I lived in a second-rate house and learned from old Commander Peng by treating guests simply. The later leaders, however, built themselves the most beautiful houses, surrounded by bamboo fences; when entertaining guests, they were very particular about appearances, often personally composing the menu and instructing the logistics staff on how to arrange flowers, and criticizing me, saying: "That man is a country bumpkin, he has never seen a grand occasion, so he often offends people!"

    "Country bumpkin, never seen a grand occasion" is indeed a major shortcoming of mine. But I doubt whether "grand occasions" must be manifested in the specialization of one's own housing and the appearances of entertaining guests. Because I know that the lives of most of the masses in that unit are still very difficult.

    In recent years, I have gradually come to know what "grand occasions" are, but I find them very frightening. Last year, a comrade of the eleventh grade told me that he hired a nanny for his child, but he was very upset. Because that nanny had worked for a provincial party secretary and had seen "grand occasions," so when she arrived at his house, she was dissatisfied with everything: the housing and food were too bad, there was no small stroller to take the child to the park, she couldn't occupy the front row when watching a play, and she had to register to see a doctor at the clinic... She criticized endlessly!

    Another section-level cadre told me that in his organization, it was very difficult for section-level cadres with large families to live in two or three rooms; if they did, they would be charged ten yuan or so in rent per month, which is naturally reasonable. However, senior cadres above the section level, even if they only had three people, plus a guard and a nanny, lived in a large house with twenty or so rooms, equipped with several sets of sofas, and the rent was only a dozen yuan. "Once," this section-level cadre continued, "a minister said that he disliked his place because there were too many rooms and too few people, and he was too lonely, and he wanted me to move in with him. But I didn't want to move in, I couldn't stand that kind of grand occasion!"

    Today, there are many "walls" between people, and "grand occasions" are also a wall. Where this wall exists, it not only isolates cadres from the people, isolates leading cadres from general cadres, and isolates ministers from section chiefs, but also puts a nanny in the position of a provincial party secretary and isolates her from an eleventh-grade cadre. So, it's really scary!

    In the rectification campaign, this wall of "grand occasions" should probably also be torn down. But I do not advocate egalitarianism, nor do I advocate returning to the living standards of the Anti-Japanese War or the Jiangxi Soviet period; I believe that in the matter of life, according to the current level of productive forces, appropriately drawing some lines between various people based on work needs, distribution according to labor, and other reasonable principles would be good.

    Stalin's exposition of the Marxist view of equality in the report of the Seventeenth Party Congress is still meaningful today. But the inequality in life in some places now is actually an unconsciously imposed class society's distribution relationship on the socialist public ownership of the means of production, which must be reformed.

    If the "wall of grand occasions" of some individuals is not torn down, the result will be two: one is opposition from the masses, which will tend towards egalitarianism; the other is the corruption of the thinking of some of the masses. I heard a young man say: I originally thought that the special nature of the lives of some leading cadres was shameful; but over time, they did not change, they got used to it, and my thinking changed, I became envious, and then I wanted to climb up...

    “大场面”的墙
    劳于农
    1943年初，我以一个小小的干部，到八路军总司令部去谈调动工作的问题。一天早晨，彭副总司令约我在一起吃饭，菜很简单，一盘炒鸡蛋，两个素菜，还有一小火锅的粉条汤。我吃完饭，已经放下筷子了，彭总郑重其事地说：“同志，再喝一点汤，这是鸡汤啊！”
    晚上，在他的小小的卧室里谈工作。在极严肃的征询和指示之后，他说：“慢一点走，我要请你吃极名贵的东西”；他从一个木箱子里取出一个铁盒子来，“这是可可，是前年左权从日本鬼子手里夺来送给我的。”接着，他并不对着我地低吟道：“唉，见君遗物使人哀……！”是一种极感伤的调子。
    左权同志是八路军总部的副总参谋长，1942年6月，在反敌人的“大扫荡”的作战中，英勇牺牲了。
    彭总的艰苦朴素，我是早就闻名的，所以他对鸡汤的重视，我倒不以为奇；奇怪的是，他在鸡汤和可可问题上所流露出来的那种非常深刻的人情味。由于这种人情味，使我在他的极严肃的指示中感到无限的亲切。
    对于领袖们的许多崇高品质，我是经常留心的，但为自己的坏的积习所妨，虽然心向往之而实际上做不到。只在吃得苦，耐得穷的方面，还有些把握，二十年来怎样艰苦的环境也吓不倒我。
    全国解放以后，我曾在一个小小的单位里做领导工作，做了几年，工作上出了许多错误，终于垮台了，让位于贤。后来的人们，鉴于我的错误，就反其道而行之，这自然是对的。但有一点，却使我不能心服。我在的时候，自己住的房子是次等的，也学学彭老总，对来宾的招待很简单。后来的领导人，却给自己新盖起最漂亮的房子，四周还筑起了竹篱；在招待来宾的时候，他非常讲究体面，常常亲自开菜单，还指导总务人员，怎样摆花，还对他们批评我道：“那人是个乡巴佬，没有见过大场面，所以常常得罪人！”
    “乡巴佬，没有见过大场面”，的确是我的重大的缺点。但“大场面”，一定要表现在自己住房子的特殊化，招待来宾的体面上，我是有怀疑的。因为，我知道，那个单位的群众的生活，大多数至今也还很艰苦。
    近几年来，我也渐渐地知道什么是“大场面”了，但觉得这很可怕。去年，一位十一级的同志告诉我，他为孩子雇了一个保姆，却呕了许多的气。因为那保姆，是在一个省委书记那里做过，见过“大场面”的，所以一到他家里，处处不满意：住房、伙食太坏了，带孩子上公园没有小包车坐，看戏不能占头排，到医务所看病还要挂号……批评个没完没结！
    又一位处级干部告诉我，他所在的机关里，家庭人口多的处级干部，要住两三间房子，是很困难的；要到了，每月收房租十来元，这自然是合理的。但是，处级以上的大干部，即使只有三口人，加上警卫员和保姆，也住上一栋二十来间的大房子，配上好几套的沙发，而房租，也只收十几元。“有一次”，这位处级干部接着说：“一位部长说，他嫌自己那里房多人少，太寂寞，要我搬到他那里去住。可是，我才不想搬进去呢，我看不惯那种大场面！”
    在今天，人与人之间的“墙”是很多的，“大场面”也是一堵墙。这墙存在的地方，不但使干部与人民隔离，使领导干部与一般干部隔离，使部长与处长也隔离起来，而且，使一个保姆，也处在省委书记的地位与十一级干部隔离起来。所以，真是可怕！
    在整风中，这一堵“大场面”的墙，恐怕也是应该拆除的。但我并不提倡平均主义，也不主张恢复到抗日战争或江西苏区时期的那种生活水平；我以为，在生活问题上，根据现在的生产力水平，在各色人等之间，依照工作需要、按劳分配和其他合理的原则，适当地划些线，也就好了。
    斯大林在十七次党代表大会的报告中所阐述的马克思主义的平等观，现在仍然是有意义的。但现在某些地方生活上的不平等，却实在是不自觉地强加于生产资料社会主义公有制的一种阶级社会的分配关系，这是必须改革的。
    某些个人的“大场面”的墙不拆除，其结果是两个：一个是群众反对，这反对会从正确的趋向平均主义去；一个是一部分群众的思想的败坏，我听到一个青年说：我对于某些领导干部的生活的特殊化，本来是认为可耻的；但久而久之，他们不改，习以为常，我的思想也就起了变化，羡慕起来了，于是就想往上爬……。
