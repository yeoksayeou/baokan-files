    我国家领导人
    电贺捷克斯洛伐克国庆
    新华社8日讯　毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理今天致电捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统安·萨波托斯基、国民议会主席兹·费林格和总理威·西罗基，祝贺捷克斯洛伐克共和国国庆。
    贺电说，当捷克斯洛伐克共和国国庆纪念的时候，请允许我们代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向你们，并且通过你们向捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民高兴地看到，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在建设社会主义的事业中取得了巨大的成就，并且为这些成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    不久以前，以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团来我国进行了友好访问，我们两国签订了友好合作条约、文化合作协定和保健合作协定。这不但对进一步发展和加强中捷两国人民的友好合作关系作出了重要的贡献，而且也有利于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结和维护世界和平的事业。
