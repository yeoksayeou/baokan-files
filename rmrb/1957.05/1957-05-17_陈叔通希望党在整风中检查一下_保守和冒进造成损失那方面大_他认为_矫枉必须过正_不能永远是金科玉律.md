Chen Shutong Hopes the Party Will Examine During the Rectification Campaign Which Caused Greater Losses: Conservatism or Rash Advance
He Believes "To Correct a Wrong, One Must Overcorrect" Cannot Always Be a Golden Rule

Why is there a wall and a ditch between the Party and the masses? Chen Shutong believes that, from the perspective of Party members, it is due to feelings of resentment, contempt, and untouchability towards non-Party members. Chen Shutong said: Despite repeated education by the Party for its members, explaining that Party members only have the obligation to serve the people and should not consider themselves meritorious, some Party members always believe that they were the ones who won the country, and that non-Party members are eating ready-made meals and enjoying ready-made blessings after the revolution, and are also in high positions, which is naturally resented. Party members also believe that non-Party members do not understand politics, and even if they have other strengths, they are useless without understanding politics, and these strengths contain toxins. Therefore, they look down on non-Party members. What does it mean to be untouchable? Some Party members believe that the working class, the industrial and commercial sectors, and the petty bourgeoisie have class issues, and getting involved with them will be eroded. They are afraid of being infected, so it's better to keep a distance from them. In this way, a wall and a ditch unknowingly appear between the Party and the masses. Therefore, in order to tear down the wall and fill the ditch, Party members should first extend their hands, and then non-Party members will find it easier to extend their hands.

Chen Shutong proposed the hope that the Party can examine two issues during the rectification campaign. One is to examine whether the losses caused by conservatism and the losses caused by rash advance in the work of the past eight years, which is greater. The other is to examine the issue of comprehensiveness and individuality, whether there is a situation of neglecting individual issues. He believes that, in general, non-Party members are more conservative, and Party members are more radical; non-Party members tend to exaggerate individual issues and obliterate the overall situation, while Party members tend to neglect individual issues and emphasize the overall view of issues. He believes that if there are similar individual issues, then they are no longer individual; and some individual issues may develop into overall issues. Even if it is only an individual issue, if it is of a serious nature, it should not be ignored. Moreover, these individual issues, when they fall on one person, one village, or one township, are unbearable. Of course, non-Party members should not exaggerate individual issues and obliterate the overall situation; on the other hand, Party members should not ignore individual issues.

Chen Shutong believes that non-Party members should learn more about new things, and Party members should also learn more about old things, so that they can understand the things and social conditions of the old historical period. Today's Party members are too unfamiliar with the old society and cannot understand some of the facts that did exist at that time.

Chen Shutong also said that some maxims have become golden rules in the past few years since liberation. Some things, I think, are worth questioning. For example, "To correct a wrong, one must overcorrect." It was correct to propose this in the early days of liberation, because large-scale movements such as land reform, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns could not have been carried out without it. But is it always a golden rule, or are there any problems with it? Can the leadership consider it?

Also, "overcoming difficulties." Of course, we should overcome difficulties. If we don't overcome difficulties, our country wouldn't be where it is today, and we will still need to overcome difficulties in the future. Because our country is a large, backward country with a population of 600 million, there are still many difficulties, whether from the perspective of people's needs or the international situation. What else can we do if we don't overcome them? But we can't bring up these four words for every problem and ask people to overcome difficulties. Three people eating the food for five people, this difficulty can be overcome; but if three people's food has to feed ten people, this difficulty is very difficult to overcome. Broad principles cannot be eaten as food. You can talk about broad principles after eating, but you can't talk about broad principles on an empty stomach. We can't make "overcoming difficulties" a catchphrase and tell people for every problem: Go and overcome the difficulties!

Chen Shutong finally mentioned the relationship between the Party and the administration. He said, "When I first saw the joint directive issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I didn't understand why it was done this way. Of course, the country is led by the Party, and the Party can decide on principles and policies. But the State Council is the highest administrative organ. In my opinion, issues related to administration should be instructed by the State Council. Because joint directives easily create the impression among the people that directives issued jointly by the Party and the government are important, while those issued by the State Council alone are not important. This is tantamount to weakening the power of the State Council."

    陈叔通希望党在整风中检查一下
    保守和冒进造成损失那方面大
    他认为“矫枉必须过正”不能永远是金科玉律
    在党群关系之间，为什么会有墙有沟？陈叔通认为，从党员方面来说，由于对非党员有气不过、看不起和惹不得的情绪。陈叔通说：尽管党对党员一再进行了教育，说明党员只有为人民服务的义务，不能以功臣自居，但是有些党员总以为天下是自己打下来的，非党人士在革命胜利以后，吃现成饭，享现成福，而且高高在上，当然气不过。党员还认为非党人士不懂政治，即使有其他长处，不懂政治，也没有用处，并且在这些长处之中，都含有毒素。因之，看不起非党人士。怎么叫惹不得呢？有些党员认为工人阶级同工商界、小资产阶级是阶级问题，搞在一起，就会受侵蚀，他们怕受传染，因此惹不得，还是同他们生疏些好。这样，不知不觉地就在党群之间有了墙和沟。因之，为了推翻墙，填平沟，要请党员先伸出手来，那样，非党员就比较容易伸出手来。
    陈叔通提出希望党在整风中能检查两个问题。一个是检查一下，八年以来的工作中，由于保守所造成的损失和由于冒进所造成的损失，究竟那一方面大。另一个是检查一下全面和个别两个方面的问题，是不是有忽视个别问题的情况。他认为，一般说，非党员多是比较保守，党员多是比较激进；非党员往往扩大个别问题，抹煞全面，而党员却容易忽视个别问题，强调全面看问题。他认为，对于个别问题，如果还有类似的个别问题，就不是个别的了；并且有的个别问题，可能发展成全面的问题。就是以个别问题而论，要是性质严重的，也不应忽视。何况这些个别的问题，落在一个人、一个村、一个乡上，就受不了。诚然，非党员不应该扩大个别问题抹煞全面，另一方面，党员也不应该忽视个别问题。
    陈叔通认为非党员要多了解些新东西，党员也要多了解些旧东西，就可以晓得旧的历史时期的事物和社会情况。现在的党员对旧社会太生疏了，不能理解那时确实存在的一些事实。
    陈叔通又说，解放几年来有些格言，成了金科玉律。有些东西我看值得怀疑。比如“矫枉必须过正”，在解放初期这样提是正确的，因为土地改革、“三反”、“五反”等大运动不如此是搞不起来的。但是是不是永远都是金科玉律，有没有毛病？领导上能不能加以考虑。
    还有“克服困难”，当然，应该克服困难。如果不克服困难，我们的国家不会有今天，今后也仍然要克服困难。因为我们的国家是个拥有六亿人口的落后的大国，无论从人民需要或国际情况来看，都还有很多困难，不克服如何办？但是不能任何问题都抬出这四个字，都叫人克服困难。三个人的饭五个人吃，这个困难可以克服；如果三个人的饭要十个人吃这个困难就很难克服了。讲大道理不能当饭吃，吃了饭讲大道理可以，但饿着肚子讲大道理就不行。不能把“克服困难”当成口头禅，什么问题都叫人：你去克服困难吧！
    陈叔通最后提到党和行政的关系问题。他说，我开始看到中共中央和国务院联合发布指示，我不懂为什么要这样作。当然，国家是由党领导的，党可以抉择方针政策问题。但国务院是最高行政机关，我以为，有关行政方面的问题应由国务院发指示。因为联合发指示容易在人民中造成一种印象：党和政府一道发的指示就是重要的，国务院单独发就不重要，这样，就无异削弱了国务院的权力。
