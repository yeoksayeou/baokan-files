National Musicians Say "We Seem to be Orphans"

    (Our report) The music community's lack of attention to national music was exposed by national music workers at a forum on national music issues jointly held by the Chinese Musicians Association and the National Music Research Institute of the Central Conservatory of Music on the afternoon of the 17th.

Neglecting While Alive, Anxious After Death

    Everyone felt that the work of inheriting the legacy had not been noticed. Wang Shixiang said with great emotion: Sheng Jialun died before he could leave behind his wealth of valuable legacy, and people only sighed about this at the memorial service. But have the national musicians who are alive been valued? No. He said, "Mr. Guan Pinghu is sixty years old this year. He had a high fever for a few days some time ago, but fortunately recovered soon. If something really happened to him, our loss would be too great. How can we face the people?" Mr. Guan Pinghu is a famous guqin player who has worked hard to collect and study ancient tunes and has a lot of insights, and is willing to contribute them. However, only one record of his performance of the guqin piece "Guangling San" was recorded last year.
    Guan Pinghu and Yang Dajun proposed to quickly record the tunes of folk wind and percussion performers in Beijing. It is said that wind and percussion music was passed down from the performance methods in Tang and Song dynasty music and continuously enriched by folk popular tunes. These scores have never been recorded in writing, and are entirely remembered in the minds of wind and percussion performers. Each performer can play three or fifty tunes, and some used to know more than one hundred and eighty tunes. Unfortunately, people rarely invite wind and percussion performers for weddings, funerals, and celebrations these days, so the performers have gradually forgotten many of the tunes. If we don't record them now, there is a real danger of them being lost.

Accepting Members in Four Classes
    Many People Despair at the Threshold

    From the Musicians Association's acceptance of members, we can also see the sectarianism that does not value national music. Wang Shixiang said that people feel that the Musicians Association divides members into four classes: the easiest to be absorbed are politicians who are also musicians; for music workers of the same level, the Musicians Association always develops or only develops party members first; the second class is those who engage in Western music; the third class is those who engage in national music; and the last class is artists. As for those who study national music theory, it is even more difficult to join. For example, Mr. Wang Mengshu, a leading guqin player in China who has been studying for more than 40 years, is still not a member.
    Wang Fandi and Chen Yonglu of the national orchestra of the Central Film Documentary Studio especially emphasized the situation that various aspects do not pay attention to cultivating and using young national music performers. They are mostly young men from the Shanghai Orchestra, full of energy, but have nowhere to use it. The studio only gives them very few tasks, and they hope to perform and practice more in society, but they don't get the opportunity. Wang Fandi gave an example: once, a music team accompanying an art troupe abroad initially said that they only wanted Western music, but then said that national music was better, but they didn't let those who engaged in national music go, but temporarily let those who engaged in Western music change their profession, as if our national music was very easy to play, and the result was of course not good.

Before the Tune is Finished, the String Breaks

    Everyone believes that reforming musical instruments is an important issue in national music. It is art, not technology, and must not rely solely on industrial departments. The strings used on the qin are getting lower and lower in quality, and often break before the tune is finished when playing. Some flutes produced recently also have inaccurate tones, making people laugh and cry when playing. This is the result of industrial departments using the worst raw materials to make up the numbers and producing shoddy products. Therefore, national music departments must actively intervene and participate in the reform of musical instruments.
    National music performers receive very low royalties for recording records. Mr. Guan Pinghu's "Guangling San" has a high royalty rate, but he can only get 2.5% (that is, the manufacturer sells one hundred yuan, and the performer gets two yuan and five cents). This unreasonable and excessively low treatment affects the lives and emotions of national music performers.

    "We seem to be orphans!" Many national musicians who attended the meeting said this. They suggested establishing a National Music Academy and publishing a national music journal.

### 民族音乐家们说“我们好像没娘的孩子”

    民族音乐家们说“我们好像没娘的孩子”
    本报讯　音乐界不重视民族音乐的问题，被民族音乐工作者们在17日下午中国音乐界协会、中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所联合召开的关于民族音乐问题的座谈会上纷纷揭露出来了。活着不重视死了干着急
    大家都感到继承遗产的工作没被注意。王世襄十分感慨地谈到：盛家伦没来得及留下他一肚子宝贵遗产就死了，人们只是在追悼会上叹息这点；可是活着的一些民族音乐家们被重视没有呢？没有。他说：“管平湖老先生今年六十岁了，前些日子发了几天高烧，幸而不久痊愈，要是真有三长两短，我们的损失就太大了，怎么对得起人？”管平湖老先生是著名的古琴家，搜集、研究古曲很努力很有心得，也愿意贡献出来，可是只在去年才灌下他演奏的古琴“广陵散”一张唱片。
    管平湖、杨大钧提出要赶快把北京民间吹鼓艺人的曲调记录下来。据说，吹鼓乐是从唐宋大乐中的演奏法传下来并且不断由民间通俗曲调加以丰富而成的。这种曲谱从来没有文字记录，全凭吹鼓艺人脑子记，每个艺人大都会三、五十曲，从前有人会一百八十多曲。可惜现在民间婚、丧、喜、庆不大请吹鼓艺人了，艺人们也就渐渐忘了许多曲谱。再不去记录，真有失传之虞。
    接受会员分四等
    许多人望门兴叹
    从音协接受会员看，也可见得不重视民族音乐的宗派主义现象。王世襄说，人们感到音协收会员分四等：最易被吸收的是政治家兼音乐家，对一样水平的音乐工作者，音协总是先发展或只发展党员；第二等是搞西洋音乐者；第三等才是搞民族音乐者；最后一等则是艺人。至于研究民族音乐理论的人，则更是入会无门。如汪孟舒老先生，是国内有数的名古琴家，研究四十余年了，还不是会员。
    中央电影纪录制片厂民族乐队的王范地、陈永禄特别着重谈到各方面不重视培养、使用青年民族音乐演奏者的情况。他们大都是从上海乐队来的小伙子，精力充沛，但是没处发挥。厂里只给他们很少任务，他们盼望能在社会上多演出多锻炼，可是得不到机会。王范地举了一个例子：一次随艺术团出国一队音乐队，先说只要西乐的，后来说还是民族音乐好，可又不让搞民族音乐的去，却临时让搞西乐的改行，仿佛我们民族音乐是很容易演奏似的，结果影响当然不好。
    未成曲调先断弦
    大家认为，改革乐器是民族音乐中的重要问题，是艺术不是技术，决不能单纯依靠工业部门。现在琴上用的弦，质量越来越低，演奏时，常常未成曲调先断弦。最近出产的一些笛子，也音色不准，吹起来令人啼笑皆非。这都是工业部门以最劣原料充数和粗制滥造的结果，因此民族音乐部门必须积极过问和参与乐器的改革工作。
    民族音乐演奏家灌了唱片，拿的版税也极低。管平湖先生的“广陵散”，版税算是高的了，也只能拿到2.5％（即厂方卖掉一百元，演奏者得二点五元）。这种不合理的过低的待遇，使民族音乐演奏家的生活和情绪受到影响。
   “我们好像没娘的孩子！”好多到会的民族音乐家说了这句话。他们建议成立民族音乐院，出版民族音乐刊物。
