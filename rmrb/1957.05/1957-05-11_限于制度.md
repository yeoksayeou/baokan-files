    Limited by Regulations	
    I went to the department store to buy one and a quarter *jin* of silk floss. The salesclerk said, "Our silk floss is packaged in half-*jin* units. Four *liang* is hard to sell." I said, "Then I'll buy one and a half *jin*." "That won't work either. You have to buy it one *jin* at a time, or two packages at a time. If you buy one and a half *jin*, it's hard for us to sell!" "Why is that?" "That's the regulation set by our superiors!"

    I went to the ticket office to buy a train ticket. The ticket seller said, "We sell tickets by phone. Please call us to buy one." So I asked for the phone number and used the public telephone next to him to call. He asked me what kind of ticket I wanted, where I was going, and my address, etc., which I told him over the phone. Then I hung up and walked back over, ready to pay and get my ticket. But he said, "No, someone will deliver the ticket to your home tomorrow and collect the money at the same time. However, there will be a small service fee." "Why can't I buy it in person right now?" "That's the regulation set by our superiors!"

    Regulations, regulations! These comrades can truly be considered models of strict adherence to regulations. However, why are regulations made? By whom are regulations made? Since regulations are made by people, when regulations are unreasonable, why can't people change them, instead of rigidly letting dead regulations play tricks on living people?

    限于制度	沈同衡
    到百货公司去买一斤四两丝绵。售货员说：“我们的丝绵是每半斤一包的，四两不好卖。”我说：“那么买一斤半吧。”“也不行，必须一斤一斤就是两包两包买。你要末买一斤，要末买两斤。一斤半，我们不好卖！”“这是为什么？”“这是我们上级规定的制度！”
    到售票所去买张火车票。售票员说：“我们是电话售票，请你打电话来买。”我就问明电话号码，在他旁边借用公用电话，打电话给他。他问我买什么票、到哪里去，以及住址等等，我都在电话里说了。然后挂上电话，又走过去，准备交款取票。但是他说：“不行，明天会有人把车票送到你家里去，同时收款。不过，得稍收一点手续费。”“为什么现在当面不能买呢？”“这是我们上级规定的制度！”
    制度，制度！这些同志倒真正可算是严格遵守制度的模范了。可是，制度是为什么而规定的？为什么人规定的？制度既是人规定的，制度不合理的时候，人为什么就不能改变它，而硬要让死制度跟活人开玩笑呢？
