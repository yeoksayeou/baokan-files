    In the Places Where Marx Lived
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    In London, Clerkenwell Green is just a small square, but it is a place of historical significance. In 1381, the English people's uprising stretched from here all the way to St. Paul's Cathedral; in 1848, the Chartist movement organized the May 15th march here; and in 1864, it became the center of the First International's activities.

    Low buildings surround the square like a fence. Nearby, a church peeks out its tall white spire from behind a two-story building. This ancient two-story building is the place where the First International frequently gathered – now the Marx Memorial Library.

    The Marx Memorial Library was founded in 1933. Before that, it was a printing house and later a coffee shop. British workers launched a fundraising campaign to create the Marx Memorial Library to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Marx's death. They raised enough money to purchase the building.

    The current Marx Memorial Library consists of three rooms upstairs. The largest of these is a library with over 12,000 books. The facilities in the room, especially the lighting, are not very good. One can imagine that the funding to maintain this memorial hall is not very generous. However, almost all of Marx's works can be found here. The person in charge of the memorial proudly introduced to us that it also contains important documents of the Chinese Communist Party.

    In another larger room, there are about a few dozen chairs. This is where workers often come to receive socialist education. It was here that Marx was once an active speaker and listener. His works "Wage Labour and Capital," "The Civil War in France," and "The Poverty of Philosophy" were first printed here in English. A framed photograph of Marx's passport is a precious memento in this room. This is the passport Marx used to flee to England in 1849 after being expelled from Germany and notified to leave Paris. The passport reads: Karl Marx, thirty-two years old, profession: Doctor of Philosophy. There is no photo on the passport, but to its left are marked the features of Marx's face.

    In this room, there are also some old newspapers and leaflets. The oldest newspaper is the May 24, 1871, issue of Le Vengeur, which was the last issue of the Paris Commune newspaper. On May 25th, the Paris Commune was suppressed. On the first page of the 24th issue, the Commune's appeal was published in almost half a page, calling on French workers and people to hold their positions and persevere in the struggle, "to fight to the end for the Commune, for France, and for humanity."

    The smallest room here is also the most commemorative. The interior is arranged as Lenin described: with only a small desk, a bookshelf, and a chair. It would be quite difficult to squeeze in another chair. This is Marx's study. From 1902 to 1903, Lenin sat here and edited "Iskra" (The Spark). The last issue of "Neue Rheinische Zeitung" (1849, 3, 29) edited by Marx, the "Justice Newspaper" of the Social Democratic Party on May 2, 1903, and "Iskra" are now hanging in this room.

    We saw the earliest edition of "Das Kapital" treasured by the memorial hall—the German text published in 1883. Engels's autograph is still clearly visible. Many blank spaces in the book have Engels's pencil annotations. The origin of this book is quite interesting: Six years ago, a member of the British Communist Party was browsing an old bookstore and asked the bookstore owner if he had any socialist books. The owner replied casually, "There are a few German books downstairs, go and find them yourself." He found this copy of Das Kapital in a pile of old books. The owner asked for fifteen shillings, but he bought it for ten shillings and immediately donated it to the memorial hall.

    The great Marx spent most of his life in London. During his thirty-four years in London, he moved several times and experienced the hardships of exile, poverty, and the torment of illness.

    With a feeling of mourning for this great revolutionary teacher, we visited each of the places where he lived. 4 Anderson Street was his first residence after coming to London and is the most well-preserved one. It is a three-story building, and from the outside, it is the most basic residence in West London. Marx edited three issues of the "Neue Rheinische Zeitung" here. It is said that for this reason, coupled with his inability to pay the rent, he was driven out into the street by the landlord after six months.

    When we tried to go inside to visit, we were refused by an old woman. She said categorically, "This is a private residence, there is nothing for you to visit." Later we learned that the current residents are Conservatives. No wonder the owner refused us and emphasized "private residence" in this way.

    Marx first moved to 64 Dean Street near Soho Square. This house was destroyed during the war and is now a ruin. It is said that Marx only lived here for a little over a year before moving to 28 Dean Street. The Marx family lived in two small rooms on the top floor of this three-story building for more than six years. Below it was the Gwatkin Hotel. When Marx lived in Soho, it was after the split of the Communist League, and he devoted himself to scientific research here. His "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," "Herr Vogt," "The Eastern Question," and "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" were all written here. When he was writing "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," he was ill and had no money, so he had to borrow money from the workers to maintain the most basic life. Marx described his situation at the time as: "My situation has now reached such an interesting point that I can no longer go out, because my clothes are all in the pawnshop; I can no longer eat meat, because no one will give me credit."

    For the next twenty years, the Marx family lived at 9 Grafton Terrace (now 46) and 41 Maitland Park Road in the northwestern suburbs of London. These two residences are no more than half a mile apart, and they are both in disrepair. It is said that the London municipal authorities plan to demolish them. 9 Grafton Terrace was where Marx was surrounded by creditors. It was in this situation that he completed the first volume of "Das Kapital." From here to the British Museum is about four or five miles. Marx would go there at nine in the morning, sit in the reading room of the museum until seven in the evening, and collect a large amount of information for his "Das Kapital." Now, people who visit the British Museum must go and see desk D2 in the reading room, because this is where Marx worked. Returning from here, Marx continued to work until late at night. This is how he worked tirelessly for humanity until he stopped breathing at 41 Maitland Park Road.

    The British workers will not forget this outstanding leader of the proletariat. Last May, they raised funds again to rebuild Marx's tomb in Highgate Cemetery. A huge bust of Marx stands on the granite tombstone. The front of the tombstone is engraved with Marx's famous saying: "Workers of all countries, unite!" (Image attached)

    在马克思生活过的地方
    本报记者　苏蓝
    在伦敦，克勒肯韦尔·格林只不过是一个很小的广场，但却是一个具有历史意义的地方。1381年英国人民的起义队伍从这里一直排到了圣保罗大殿；1848年，大宪章运动者在这里组织了5月15日的大游行；到了1864年，它又成为第一国际活动的中心。
    矮小的建筑物好像篱笆一样团团地把广场围住。附近的一座教堂，在一幢二层楼房的后面探出它那高大的白色尖顶。这座古老的二层楼建筑，就是当年第一国际经常集会的场所——也就是现在的马克思纪念馆。
    马克思纪念馆成立于1933年。在这以前，它是一个印刷所，后来又成为一座咖啡店。英国的工人为了纪念马克思逝世五十周年，发起了创立马克思纪念馆的募捐。他们凑够了购买这座房屋的款项。
    现在的马克思纪念馆，是由楼上的三间房子组成的。其中最大的一间，是一个拥有一万二千多册书籍的图书馆。屋中的设备，特别是光线，都不很好。可以想像得到，维持这个纪念馆的经费，是并不十分宽裕的。但是，在这里几乎可以找到马克思主义的所有著作。纪念馆的负责人骄傲地向我们介绍：它也藏有中国共产党的重要文件。
    在另外一间较大的房子里，摆着约几十张椅子。这是工人经常来这里接受社会主义教育的课堂。就在这里，马克思曾经是积极的讲演者和听众之一。他的著作“雇佣劳动与资本”、“法兰西内战”、“哲学底贫困”等最早的英文版，都是在这里印刷的。一张装在镜框内的马克思的护照，是现在这间房子里一件珍贵的纪念物。这是1849年马克思被德国驱逐并被通知离开巴黎后，流亡英国的护照。护照上写着：卡尔·马克思，三十二岁，职业：哲学博士。护照上没有照片，但在它的左面，标志着马克思的面貌的特征。
    在这间屋子里，还陈列着一些年代久远的报纸和传单。最老的一张报纸，是1871年5月24日的拉文热尔报，它是巴黎公社所出的最后一期报纸。5月25日，巴黎公社被镇压。在24日的报纸的第一版上，以大半版篇幅登载了公社的呼吁书，它号召法国工人和人民保持阵地，坚持斗争，“为公社、为法兰西、为人类而战斗到底。”
    这里最小的一间房子，也是最有纪念意义的一间房子。屋内陈设犹如当年列宁所说的：只有一个很小的写字台，一个书架和一把椅子。要想再塞进一把椅子，恐怕是相当困难的了。这是马克思的工作室。1902年到1903年，列宁就坐在这里编辑“火星报”。马克思编辑的最后一期“新莱因报”（1849，3、29）、社会民主党的1903年5月2日的“正义报”以及“火星报”现在都挂在这间房子里。
    我们看到了纪念馆珍藏的一部“资本论”的最早版本——1883年出版的德文本。恩格斯的亲笔签名，仍清晰可见。书中的许多空白处，都有恩格斯的铅笔注解。这本书的来历是颇有趣味的：六年以前，有一位英共党员逛旧书铺的时候，问书店老板有没有社会主义的书籍。老板漫不经心地回答：“楼下有几本德文书，你自己去找吧。”他在旧书堆中，发现了这部资本论。老板讨价十五先令，他花了十先令就买到了手，并且立刻把它献给了纪念馆。
    伟大的马克思在伦敦渡过了他的大半生。他在伦敦生活的三十四个年头中，曾数度移居，尝尽了流亡的艰难、贫困的滋味和疾病的折磨。
    我们怀着对这位伟大革命导师的悼念心情，一一走访了他所居住过的地方。安顿逊街第四号，是他来伦敦后的第一个住所，也是目前保存得最完整的一个住所。这是一所三层楼房，从外表看，它是西伦敦最起码的住宅。马克思在这儿编辑过三期“新莱因报”。据说由于这个原故，加之他无力付清房租，在六个月之后，他即被房东驱于街头。
    当我们试图进去参观时，被一个老妇人拒绝了。她斩钉截铁地说：“这儿是私人的住宅，没有什么可供你们参观的。”事后我们知道，现在住在这儿的是保守党人。难怪主人把我们拒之门外并且这样强调“私人的住宅”。
    马克思第一次迁居到索荷广场附近的第恩街六十四号。这幢房子在战争期间被炸毁，现在是一片废墟。据说，马克思在这里只住了一年多一点，然后才移到同条街上的二十八号住宅。马克思一家在这栋三层楼上的两间小房子中生活了六年多。在它的下面，是格瓦底斯饭店。马克思住在索荷的时候，是在共产主义者同盟分裂后，他在这里埋头科学研究。他的“拿破仑第三政变记”、“福格特先生”、“东方问题”和“政治经济学批判”都是在这里写成的。当他写“拿破仑第三政变记”的时候，他正害着病，手中又无分文，他不得不向工人们借些钱来维持最起码的生活。马克思是这样叙述自己当时的处境的：“我的状况现在已经到了这种有趣的地步，我不能再出门，因为衣服都在当铺里；我不能再吃肉，因为没有人肯赊了。”
    往后的二十多年，马克思一家是在伦敦西北郊区的格来弗顿街九号（现在的四十六号）和美特兰公园路四十一号度过的。这两幢住宅相距不过半里，它们都已破烂不堪。据说，伦敦市政当局打算把它们拆掉。格来弗顿街九号，就是马克思被债主们包围的地方。就在这种情况下，他完成了“资本论”的第一卷。从这里到大英博物馆，大约有四、五英里的路程。马克思早上九点就到那里去，坐在博物馆的图书室中，直到晚上七点钟，为他的“资本论”搜集大量的资料。现在，去参观大英博物馆的人，都要去看看图书室中的D行第二号桌子，因为这是马克思工作过的座位。从这里回来，马克思继续工作至深夜。他就是这样奋发不懈的为人类工作着。直到他在美特兰公园路四十一号停止了呼吸为止。
    英国的工人，是不会忘记这位杰出的无产阶级的领袖的。去年5月，他们又集资重建了在海格特公墓的马克思墓。在花岗石的墓碑上，树立着马克思的巨大头像。墓碑的正面镌刻着马克思的名言：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”（附图片）
