    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th, Tokyo dispatch: Representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party's Special Committee on Military Base Countermeasures visited the US Embassy in Japan and the Far East US Military Headquarters this morning to protest the US Department of Defense's order to the Far East US military authorities not to hand over the American soldier, Girard, who murdered a Japanese farmer in Somagahara, to Japan for trial, and demanded that the US withdraw this order.
    The Japan-US Joint Committee had made a decision on May 16th to hand Girard over to the Japanese side for trial, but the US Department of Defense issued an order the following day that violated this decision.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th, Yokohama dispatch: The Japanese Garrison Workers' Union, with more than 11,800 members, has decided to hold a strike in the period from late May to late June to oppose the new exploitative measures of the US military authorities stationed in Japan.
    The US military authorities stationed in Japan put forward a new Japan-US Labor Basic Contract on April 2nd this year, which in essence is to reduce wages and worsen working conditions.
    The Japanese Garrison Workers' Union made the decision to strike at an extraordinary national congress held in Yokohama on the 19th, and authorized the union headquarters to lead the strike. The specific plan for the strike will be decided by the Central Struggle Committee.

    日社会党抗议美国包庇凶犯
    日本驻军工会决定发动罢工反对美军剥削
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本社会党军事基地对策特别委员会的代表，今天上午访问了美国驻日本大使馆和远东美军司令部，抗议美国国防部命令远东美军当局不把在相马原杀害日本农妇的美国兵哲腊德交给日本审判，并且要求美国收回这项命令。
    日美联合委员会曾经在5月16日作出决定，要把哲腊德交给日本方面审判，但是美国国防部次日就发出了违背这项决定的命令。
    新华社20日讯　横滨消息：拥有一万一千八百多名会员的日本驻军工会，为了反对驻日美军当局新的剥削措施，决定在5月下旬到6月下旬的期间内举行罢工。
    驻日美军当局在今年4月2日提出了新的日美劳务基本合同，这个合同实质上是要降低工资，并且使劳动条件恶化。
    日本驻军工会19日在横滨举行的临时全国代表大会作出了罢工的决定，并且授权工会总部领导这次罢工，罢工的具体计划将由中央斗争委员会决定。
