Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The congratulatory speech by Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrade Delegates:

It has been eight years since the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in 1949 to the convening of this Third National Congress. During these eight years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Youth League has actively participated in our country's struggle for democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and has actively participated in the great socialist construction. The Youth League, in its work, has proved worthy of being the banner of the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, and worthy of being a strong assistant to the Party on all fronts. Now, our motherland, due to the basic completion of socialist transformation, has entered a new historical period, and our youth movement will also enter a new historical period accordingly. As a symbol of this great historical transformation, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will be renamed the Chinese Communist Youth League at the Third Congress now being held. I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Using the name Communist Youth League to refer to our advanced youth force not only brings great glory to all Youth League members, but also places more arduous tasks on the shoulders of Chinese youth. This task is to educate the younger generation with the spirit of communism under the leadership of the Party, to unite all youth to actively participate in socialist construction, so as to build our country into a great socialist industrial power as soon as possible, and to prepare conditions for the future realization of communism. Comrades, this is our task for a long period to come. This task is by no means easier or more relaxed than the revolutionary tasks of the past. It must be understood that our country's original economic backwardness, the poverty of the broad masses of the people, and the encirclement of imperialism mean that we still face many difficulties. If we cannot unite all the people of the country and give full play to their enthusiasm, working diligently and frugally, and struggling arduously, then our socialist construction cannot achieve victory. In the face of this arduous task, our Communist Youth League members must, with infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people, stand together with the Party at the forefront of this great struggle, closely connect with the broad masses of the people and youth, and carry out long-term arduous struggle in different posts.

Comrades, to create a happy socialist life, extremely hard work is indispensable. We must participate in labor, especially physical labor in industrial and agricultural production, because physical labor is the foundation of social existence and development, and a glorious obligation to be borne by the vast majority of the people. The remnants of the exploiting class's ideology of despising physical labor are obstacles to the progress of our new society. Our Youth League members, to be worthy of being advanced communist fighters, must fight against the idea of despising labor, especially physical labor, and lead the broad masses of youth to the front line of physical labor with their own exemplary behavior. We must become a shock force on the labor front of socialist construction worthy of the people's trust.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China expresses its respect to all young men and women on the industrial and agricultural production front. They are the vanguards of our country's socialist construction and the creators of the people's happy life. We hope that they will make greater efforts to increase production and practice economy, and that they will complete their tasks even more outstandingly. We hope that young students across the country will study hard and actively prepare to participate in the productive labor of building the motherland, first and foremost physical labor. Young people engaged in mental labor should also go through a period of physical labor, which is necessary for their comprehensive development of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Youth League cadres should not be separated from production if it is not necessary; if it is necessary to be separated from production, they should also take some time to participate in physical labor, which is of great benefit for contacting the masses and exercising themselves.

In order to better complete the task of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party, all members of the Chinese Communist Youth League need to constantly strive to learn. We must combine the practice of building the motherland with the effort to study Marxism-Leninism, improve our communist consciousness, and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology and other erroneous ideas. We must strive to learn various labor skills and continuously improve our cultural, scientific and technological levels. Youth League members must lead the broad masses of youth to respect the older generation and learn various useful skills from them.

As a close assistant of the Communist Party of China, Communist Youth League members must also learn how to unite the broadest masses of youth to move forward together. We must not only be good at uniting advanced youth, but also be good at uniting all patriotic youth, including patriotic youth who do not yet approve of the communist worldview, to jointly strive for the socialist cause of the motherland. The Communist Youth League should overcome any sectarian tendencies that deviate from the masses within its own ranks, and strive to become the intimate friend and core force of all patriotic youth in China. And in order to achieve this goal, we must especially advocate humility, oppose arrogance and complacency, and require every Youth League member to strive to help others, and not be afraid of suffering losses. Suffering first, enjoying later, this is our slogan.

Comrades, although the tasks before us are very arduous, the Communist Party of China firmly believes that the Youth League members and all the youth of China will surely be able to overcome various difficulties on their path and outstandingly complete their glorious tasks. This is because the Chinese youth not only have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the care of the democratic parties and non-party patriotic people, but also have their own glorious revolutionary traditions. In the long revolutionary struggle of the past and the construction work in recent years, the Chinese youth have already had good performance. They are not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hardship, love labor, and abide by discipline. Our Communist Youth League members must not only inherit this glorious tradition, but also greatly develop it under new historical conditions. It should be pointed out that the generation that has grown up in the favorable environment after the victory of the revolution is vigorous, but also has weaknesses. That is, many of them often see things as very easy, often fear difficulties, are unwilling to endure hardship and hard work, or make excessive and impatient demands in improving material conditions. However, this cannot be blamed on the youth, but on the fact that the Party and the League have not done enough in their work for them. As long as we further improve the ideological education work for the youth in the future, clearly tell them the true situation of the country and the inevitable path to a bright future, promote the spirit of hard struggle among all the youth, oppose the unhealthy trend of selfishness and self-interest, and strive to correct the mistakes of bureaucracy, sectarianism and subjectivism in our work, then we will surely be able to help the broad masses of youth consciously overcome their weaknesses and bravely and happily welcome their combat tasks.

Comrades, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." In this extremely glorious and great cause, the exemplary actions and creative spirit of the Youth League members will play a major role. We must write a glorious page of the youth in the victorious history of socialist construction, we must be honest and diligent, refrain from arrogance and rashness, be diligent and frugal, unite all the forces that can be united, and create our happy life with hard labor. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and we must learn from the strengths of the people of all countries in the world. We must unite with the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and we must unite with all peace-loving people in the world.

Build our motherland with hard labor!

Strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, learn science and culture!

Long live the great unity of the youth of all China!

Long live the great unity of the peace-loving youth of the world!

    在青年团第三次全国代表大会上
    邓小平同志代表中共中央致祝词
    新华社15日讯　中国共产党中央委员会总书记邓小平在中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会上的祝词。全文如下：亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国新民主主义青年团从1949年成立以来，到这次第三次全国代表大会的召开，已经八年了。这八年当中，青年团在中国共产党的领导下，积极参加了我国的民主革命和社会主义革命的斗争，积极参加了伟大的社会主义建设。青年团在自己的工作中，表现得不愧为祖国的优秀儿女的旗帜，不愧为党在各个战线上的有力的助手。现在，我们的祖国，由于社会主义改造的基本完成，已经进入了一个新的历史时期，我们的青年运动也将随之进入一个新的历史时期。作为这个伟大的历史性转变的一项标志，就是中国新民主主义青年团将要在现在召开的第三次代表大会上，改名为中国共产主义青年团。我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会向你们致以最热烈的祝贺。
    用共产主义青年团来作为我们这支青年先进队伍的名称，不只是给全体青年团员带来了巨大的光荣，而且，也在中国青年的肩上放上了更为繁重的任务。这个任务，就是在党的领导下，用共产主义的精神教育青年一代，团结全体青年积极参加建设社会主义的劳动，以便尽快地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国，为将来实现共产主义准备条件。同志们，这就是我们今后一个长时期的任务。这个任务绝不比过去的革命任务来得容易和轻松一些。必须了解，我们国家原来的经济落后，广大人民的生活还是贫苦的，而帝国主义还在包围着我们，我们的困难还是很多的。我们如果不能把全国人民都团结起来，把他们的积极性最充分地发挥起来，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，那么，我们的社会主义建设就不可能取得胜利。在这个艰巨的任务面前，我们的共产主义青年团员，一定要以对祖国、对人民的无限忠忱，同党一起站在这个伟大斗争的最前列，密切联系全体人民群众和青年群众，在不同的岗位上进行长时期的艰苦的奋斗。
    同志们，为了创造社会主义的幸福生活，没有极艰苦的劳动，是不可能的。我们要参加劳动，特别要积极参加工农业生产的体力劳动，因为体力劳动是社会存在和发展的基础，是最大多数人民都要担负的光荣义务。轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级思想的残余，是我们的新社会前进的障碍物。我们的青年团员要不愧成为共产主义的先进战士，就一定要向轻视劳动、特别是轻视体力劳动的思想作斗争，而且要以自己的模范行为带动广大青年群众投身到体力劳动的战线上去。我们要成为建设社会主义的劳动战线上一支值得人民信任的突击力量。
    中国共产党中央委员会在这里向工农业生产战线上的全体青年男女表示敬意。他们是我国社会主义建设事业的急先锋、是人民幸福生活的创造者。我们希望他们用更大的努力增产节约，希望他们更出色地完成自己的任务。我们希望全国的青年学生努力学习，积极准备参加建设祖国的生产劳动，首先是体力劳动。从事脑力劳动的青年，也应该经过一段时间的体力劳动，这对于他们的德育、智育、体育的全面发展是必要的。青年团的干部如果没有必要脱离生产，就应该不脱离生产；如果是必须脱离生产的，也应该抽出一部分时间参加体力劳动，这对于联系群众和锻炼自己，都有很大的利益。
    为了在党的领导下更好地完成社会主义建设的任务，中国共产主义青年团的全体团员，就需要不断地努力学习。我们要结合建设祖国的实践，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的共产主义觉悟，克服资产阶级思想以及其他各种错误思想的影响。我们要努力学习各种劳动的本领，不断提高自己的文化、科学技术水平。青年团员必须带动广大青年，尊敬年长的一代，从他们那里学会各种有用的本领。
    作为中国共产党的亲密助手，共产主义青年团员还必须学会怎样把最广大青年群众团结起来一道前进。我们不只是要善于团结先进的青年，而且，还要善于把一切爱国的青年、包括还不赞成共产主义世界观的爱国青年，都团结起来，共同为祖国的社会主义事业奋斗。共产主义青年团应该克服自己队伍中任何脱离群众的宗派主义的倾向，努力使自己成为中国全体爱国青年的知心朋友和核心力量。而为了达到这个目的，就要特别提倡谦虚，反对骄傲自大，就要要求每一个青年团员努力去帮助别人，而不要怕自己吃亏。吃苦在前，享受在后，这就是我们的口号。
    同志们，摆在我们面前的任务，虽然是十分艰巨的，但是，中国共产党深信，青年团员和中国全体青年必然能够克服自己道路上的各种困难，出色地完成自己的光荣任务。这是因为，中国青年不仅有中国共产党的领导，有各民主党派和无党派的爱国人士的关怀，而且有自己的光荣的革命传统。在过去长期的革命斗争和近年来的建设工作中，中国青年已经有了良好的表现。他们不怕牺牲，不怕困难，不怕吃苦，热爱劳动，遵守纪律。我们共产主义青年团员不仅要把这个光荣传统继承下来，而且要在新的历史条件下把它大大地加以发扬。应该指出，在革命胜利以后的顺利环境中生长起来的一代，是朝气勃勃的，但是也有弱点。这就是他们中间不少人往往把事情看得很容易，往往害怕困难，不愿吃苦耐劳，或者在改善物质条件方面提出过高过急的要求。但是，这不能责备青年，而在于党和团对他们的工作还做得不充分。只要我们在今后进一步改善对青年的思想教育工作，把国家的真实情况和达到美好的将来的必由之路清楚地告诉他们，在全体青年中间发扬艰苦奋斗的正气，反对自私自利的歪风，并且努力纠正我们工作中的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的错误，那么，我们就一定能够帮助广大的青年自觉地克服自己的弱点，勇敢地、愉快地迎接自己的战斗任务。
    同志们，毛泽东同志说过，“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。在这个极其光荣伟大的事业中，青年团员的模范行动和创造精神将起重大的作用。我们要在社会主义建设的胜利史上写下青年们的光辉的一页，我们就一定要老老实实，勤勤恳恳，戒骄戒躁，克勤克俭，把一切可以团结的力量团结起来，用艰苦的劳动来创造我们的幸福生活。我们要学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验，我们要学习世界各国人民的长处。我们要同以苏联为首的社会主义各国的人民团结在一起，我们要同世界上一切爱好和平的人们团结在一起。
    用艰苦的劳动建设我们的祖国！
    努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习科学和文化！
    全中国的青年大团结万岁！
    全世界爱好和平的青年大团结万岁！
