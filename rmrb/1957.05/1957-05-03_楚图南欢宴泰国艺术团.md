Chu Tunan said at the banquet that China and Thailand are close neighbors and relatives. The Chinese people not only love their own culture and art, but also love the excellent cultures of all countries. Thai art, with its distinct national characteristics, has many aspects that are worth learning from by Chinese artists.

Nai Suwan Wararit said that there is a Thai folk saying: "The people of China and Thailand are not outsiders, but brothers." The warm reception he received in China made him even more convinced that this saying is a fact. During the banquet, famous Chinese Peking Opera actors Du Jinfang and Ye ShengLan, and famous Chinese singers performed wonderful programs. Ms. Suphan Buranaphin, the Thai film queen, and Ms. Pingxi Gonchushi, the Thai queen of song, and other Thai artists also spontaneously performed classical Thai dances and songs.
