    Hungary's New National Emblem
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    During the counter-revolutionary riots of last October, the counter-revolutionaries not only burned the red flag and destroyed the red star, but also destroyed the national emblem symbolizing the worker-peasant regime everywhere. Until December of last year, the tricolor national flag with a hole in the middle was still flying in the streets of Budapest. At that time, a group of opportunistic small vendors appeared on the streets, shouting to buy a Kossuth national emblem, saying that it was the national emblem of every Hungarian. The Kossuth national emblem became a popular decoration for the people of Budapest, some pinned it on their hats, and some stuck it on their lapels.
    The Hungarian national emblem has undergone many changes. The Hungarian national emblem during the Austro-Hungarian Empire era depicted a crown, four white lines, a double cross, and three mountains on a warrior's shield. The four white lines represented the four rivers of the Danube, Tisza, Drava, and Sava, the three mountains represented the three mountains of Tatra, Mátra, and Fatra, and the double cross symbolized serfdom and religion. Kossuth led the bourgeois revolution of 1848, overthrew the empire, and established the republic. Therefore, the crown was removed from the national emblem at that time. After the failure of the Kossuth revolution, a crown was put back on the national emblem. Hungary's liberation in 1945 finally threw off this crown for the last time. In 1949, the political life of the Hungarian state had undergone fundamental changes, and the Kossuth national emblem without a crown was no longer suitable for the political ideology of the Hungarian People's Republic. In the promulgated new constitution, a national emblem representing the new era was formulated.
    What Hungarian chauvinists miss about the Kossuth national emblem is not the crown, but the four rivers and three mountains of the Austro-Hungarian Empire era. Now Hungary only has two rivers and one mountain left. Chauvinistic history teachers often tell their students that a divided Hungary is not a country, and a complete Hungary is paradise. "Radio Free Europe" constantly conducts inflammatory broadcasts to the Hungarian people: why has your Hungary become poor? Because it has lost those two rivers and two mountains. The Nagy group also put forward the slogan of a unified nation. Imperialists also want to use the national sentiments and the remnants of chauvinism of the Hungarian people, especially young students, to provoke the relationship between Hungary and its surrounding brotherly countries in order to benefit and thereby undermine the unity of the socialist camp through Hungary. The Hungarian People's Republic has made a solemn declaration in the past, and now Hungary's borders are determined borders. Hungary does not make any territorial claims to neighboring countries, thereby ending all the conspiracies of imperialists to instigate discord between the various nationalities of Hungary. This has created a reliable foundation for peace in Central Europe, and for fraternal friendship between brotherly countries, especially with Czechoslovakia and Romania.
    One of the important agenda items of the first National Assembly held after the October incident was to discuss the new national emblem. This new national emblem fully demonstrates the harmonious unity of the Hungarian people's patriotism and internationalism. Its form is surrounded by wheat ears, with two red ribbons on the right and two tricolor ribbons on the left, and the red and tricolor ribbons are knotted together at the bottom. The middle is a shield composed of red, white, and green colors. This is a shield with national characteristics, symbolizing the Hungarian people's patriotic feelings of respecting national traditions. At the top of the shield is a five-pointed red star, symbolizing the idea of the international solidarity of the working people. This red star shines brightly on a light blue background.
    When the National Assembly discussed the above draft submitted by the Presidium of the Assembly, there were no objections to its substance or spirit. At that time, a peasant representative said that the awns of the wheat ears were a bit too long, and it looked like two bundles of barley. Another representative said that the wheat ears only symbolize the fruits of labor, and it seems necessary to mark the tools of labor, such as adding a gear. A third representative said that a gear cannot represent all industries! Adding another gear or hammer will disrupt the coordination of the composition. The power of the working class has been fully expressed in the red star. There were non-party members, writers, and religious representatives among the deputies, but no one talked about the mountains and crosses on the old national emblem anymore. They unanimously supported socialism and the unity of the socialist camp. The meeting unanimously approved the new national emblem. At the end of the meeting, every people's representative wore a delicate new national emblem commemorative badge on their lapel, and everyone left the venue with victory and joy.

    匈牙利的新国徽
    本报记者　胡济邦
    去年十月暴乱期间，反革命分子除了焚烧红旗，捣毁红星外，对于象征工农政权的国徽也到处加以摧毁，直到去年12月，布达佩斯的大街上，还飘扬着中间被挖掉一块的三色国旗。那时街头上出现了一批应时的小商贩，叫喊着请买一个科苏特国徽，说这是每一个匈牙利人的国徽。科苏特国徽成了布达佩斯人的流行装饰品，有的别在帽子上，有的插在前襟上。
    匈牙利国徽曾经经过多次的改变。奥匈帝国时代的匈牙利国徽，是在一个勇士的盾牌上画着一个皇冠、四条白线、一个双十字架和三座山。那四条白线代表多瑙、蒂萨、德特拉瓦和沙瓦四条河流，三个山头代表特拉、马特拉和法特拉三座山，双十字架象征农奴和宗教。科苏特领导1848年的资产阶级革命，推翻帝制，建立了共和国，于是当时的国徽上去掉了那个皇冠。科苏特革命失败后，国徽上又重新扣上一个皇冠。1945年匈牙利解放，才最后一次抛去这个皇冠。1949年匈牙利国家的政治生活已起了根本的变化，不带皇冠的科苏特国徽也不再适合匈牙利人民共和国的政治思想。在颁布的新宪法中，制定了一个代表新时代的国徽。
    匈牙利沙文主义者对科苏特国徽所留恋的倒不是那个皇冠而是奥匈帝国时代的那四条河和三座山。现在匈牙利只剩下二条河和一座山。沙文主义的历史教员常对他们的学生说，分割的匈牙利不是国家，完整的匈牙利是天堂。“自由欧洲”电台不断地对匈牙利人民进行煽动性的广播：你们匈牙利为什么变穷了，因为失去了那二条河和二座山。纳吉集团也曾提出过统一的民族的口号。帝国主义者还想利用匈牙利人民，特别是青年学生的民族情绪和沙文主义的残余，来挑拨匈牙利和周围兄弟国家的关系，以便渔利，从而通过匈牙利来搞垮社会主义阵营的团结。匈牙利人民共和国过去曾作了庄严的声明，现在匈牙利的国界是确定的国界，匈牙利不向邻国提出任何的领土要求，从而结束了帝国主义者唆使匈牙利各民族之间不和的一切阴谋。这就为中欧的和平、为兄弟国家之间，首先是同捷、罗之间的兄弟友谊创造了可靠的基础。
    十月事件后第一次举行的国民议会的重要议程之一是讨论新国徽。在这个新国徽中充分表现出匈牙利人民的爱国主义和国际主义的协调一致。它的形式是周围环绕着麦穗，右边绕着两道红带，左边绕着两道三色带，底下把红色和三色的带子结成一个纽结，中间是红、白、绿三色构成的盾。这是一个具有民族色彩的盾，它象征着匈牙利人民尊重民族传统的爱国感情。盾的上端有一颗五角红星，象征劳动人民的国际团结的思想。这颗红星在浅蓝色的大地上发射着光芒。
    国民议会在讨论议会主席团提出的上述草图的时候，对于它的实质、精神都没有意见。当时有一位农民代表说，只是麦穗的芒太长了些，它像二束大麦。另一位代表说，麦穗只是象征劳动的成果，似乎还需要标志出劳动的工具，比如说增加一个齿轮。第三个代表说，齿轮也不能代表一切工业呀！我们再加一个齿轮或锤子，会破坏构图的协调。工人阶级的力量已充分表达在红星中。议员中有非党人士，有作家，有宗教代表，可是再没有人去谈论旧国徽上的山头和十字架，他们一致拥护社会主义和社会主义阵营的团结，会议一致通过了新国徽。在大会结束的时候，每位人民代表的衣襟上都别上了一枚精致的新国徽纪念章，每人都带着胜利和愉快的心情走出会场。　　（5月11日寄自布达佩斯）（附图片）
