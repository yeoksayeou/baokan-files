Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 19th: A joint communiqué was issued on the evening of May 18th by Egyptian President Nasser and Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, stating that both countries adhere to the policy of active neutrality and the principles of the Bandung Conference to devote themselves to consolidating world peace.

Prime Minister Daoud left Cairo on May 18th after a five-day visit to Egypt. During this period, Prime Minister Daoud held talks with President Nasser to study the international situation, especially the situation in the Middle East.

The joint communiqué stated that the two leaders unanimously agreed on the following:

1.  To work hard to consolidate world peace, and to promote world peace by adhering to the policy of active neutrality and the principles of the Bandung Conference.

2.  Peace cannot be achieved through division and the establishment of blocs, but only through the establishment of collective security on a global basis and the ending of one country's rule over another.

3.  All forms of imperialism are evil and must be ended as soon as possible. Enslaving people, imposing external control, and foreign exploitation are violations of basic human rights, violations of the United Nations Charter, and obstacles to the development of international peace and cooperation.

4.  Believing that all countries have the right to complete sovereignty and independence, and respecting equality between large and small countries.

5.  Supporting the struggles of people of all countries for freedom and independence.

6.  Believing that the act of depriving Palestinian Arabs of their rights has intensified the tension in the Middle East and constitutes a constant threat to world security.

7.  To promote cooperation between the two countries, and strengthen economic ties and cultural exchanges, in order to achieve prosperity and common welfare for both Afghanistan and Egypt.

During his visit to Cairo, Prime Minister Daoud told a reporter from "Al-Masaa" that "Afghanistan is not a member of any treaty, and will always remain neutral, because participating in foreign treaties is contrary to the interests of Afghanistan."

Daoud said that Afghanistan strives to be friendly with all countries. He said, "Our relations with the Soviet Union are based on the principles of friendship, good neighborliness, and mutual respect."

    坚持积极中立政策和万隆会议原则  必须结束外国统治并建立集体安全
    新华社开罗19日电　埃及总统纳赛尔和阿富汗首相达乌德在5月18日晚上发表联合公报，声明两国坚持积极中立的政策和万隆会议的原则，以致力于巩固世界和平。

    联合公报说，两位领袖一致同意：
    一、努力巩固世界和平，并且以坚持积极中立政策和万隆会议原则来促进世界和平。
    二、和平不能通过分裂和建立集团的办法来实现，而只有通过在全世界的基础上建立集体安全并且结束一国对另一国的统治来实现。
    三、一切形式的帝国主义都是一种罪恶，必须早日结束它。对人民进行奴役、施加外来的控制和外国的剥削，都是侵犯基本人权、违反联合国宪章的行为，并且障碍国际和平和合作的发展。
    四、相信各国有权利得到完整的主权和独立，并且尊重大国和小国之间的平等。
    五、支持各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争。
    六、认为剥夺巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人权利的行为加剧了中东的紧张局势，并且构成对于世界安全的经常威胁。
    七、促进两国之间的合作，并且加强经济联系和文化交流，以求得阿富汗和埃及两国的繁荣和共同福利。
    达乌德首相在开罗访问期间对“晚报”记者说：“阿富汗不是任何条约的成员国，并且将永远保持中立，因为参加外国条约是同阿富汗的利益相抵触的。”
    达乌德说，阿富汗力图同一切国家友好。他说：“我们同苏联的关系是以友好、睦邻和互相尊重的原则为基础的。”
