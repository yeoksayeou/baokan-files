Explaining the Truth and Reasoning Clearly
Nanjing Commodity Sales Trend Towards Normalcy

(Our Dispatch) Nanjing city launched a large-scale economic propaganda campaign to clearly explain the truth about prices, material supply, and other aspects of greatest concern to the people.

Since the second half of last year, the number of commodities in short supply in the Nanjing market has increased significantly compared to the past, causing some inconvenience to people's lives. After adjusting the prices of salt, wool, and high-end cigarettes, coupled with the relatively large increase in commodity prices in the free market, many people began to doubt the government's policy of stabilizing prices. In particular, after the state promulgated the new measure on April 20 to halve the use of the second phase of cloth coupons, some dissatisfaction arose among the people. This is precisely the contradiction between the immediate personal interests of the masses and the long-term interests of the state and the collective. In order to correctly resolve this contradiction, the Municipal Party Committee decided to conduct large-scale economic propaganda to the masses throughout the city.

In units and regions where report meetings have already been held, the dissatisfaction of the masses is gradually being eliminated. They said: If the reasoning is explained clearly, we will not have any objections. Residents of Gongyuan Street expressed after discussion that they will not rush to buy things in the future.

At present, commodity sales in the Nanjing market have tended to normalize. The phenomenon of rushing to buy undershirts and white sugar that once occurred has disappeared.

    讲明真相　说清道理
    南京商品销售趋向正常
    本报讯　南京市开展了大规模的经济宣传运动，把当前人民最关心的物价、物资供应等方面的真相，向人民群众说清楚。
    自去年下半年以来，南京市场上的供不应求的商品，比过去显著增加，使群众感到了某些生活上的不方便。调整食盐、呢绒、高档香烟价格后，加以自由市场上商品价格有较多的上涨，不少群众对政府稳定物价政策发生了怀疑。特别是4月20日国家对第二期布票决定对折使用的新措施颁布后，群众中也产生了一些不满情绪。这正是群众个人眼前利益和国家集体长远利益的矛盾。为了正确解决这一矛盾，市委决定在全市范围内大规模地向群众进行经济宣传。
    在已经举行过报告会的单位和地区，群众的不满已在逐渐消除。他们说：把道理说清楚，我们就不会有什么意见了。贡院街居民在讨论后表示，今后不去争购了。
    目前南京市场商品销售已趋正常。一度发生的争购汗衫和白糖的现象已经消失。
