Xinhua News Agency, Xining, May 20th: The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's Rectification Leadership Group Office has, since May 13th, dispatched cadres to various units to inspect the progress of the rectification campaign.

    The results of the inspections over the past few days indicate that most units have conveyed the Provincial Party Committee's instructions regarding the launch of the rectification campaign and have begun to study and formulate rectification plans. Many units have already formulated their plans. However, generally speaking, the momentum of the campaign is not strong. The main problem is that most units' Party member leading cadres have not taken action personally but have entrusted such important work to secretaries or branch secretaries. A few units' leading cadres have not even read the Provincial Party Committee's rectification instructions. Therefore, most of the rectification plans that have been formulated focus on principles and lack specific methods and clear priorities for examination. Some units simply modified the instructions from the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee and considered them their own plans. Some units' plans were even more general than the Provincial Party Committee's plans. Because most units' leading cadres have not taken action personally or have not clearly expressed their attitude, many cadres, including some mid-level leading cadres, still have certain reservations about the rectification and lack confidence. Regarding the targets of rectification, some units are also not clear enough. A few units have not fully ensured the voluntary participation of non-Party cadres in the rectification.

    In response to the above situation, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's Rectification Leadership Group has recently held meetings and issued notices, requiring Party member leading cadres in all units to seriously study the instructions from the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee regarding the rectification campaign, to personally formulate rectification plans for their own units, to conduct specific analysis based on the actual conditions of their units, and to determine the priorities for examination. At the same time, they must repeatedly mobilize, first express their own attitude and determination, dispel everyone's concerns, encourage everyone to boldly expose problems, and calmly study and solve problems in order to achieve the goal of improving work and strengthening unity. Regarding the issue of non-Party cadres participating in the rectification, it is imperative to ensure voluntary participation and allow free withdrawal at any time.

    Starting from the 20th, the First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, Gao Feng, will also rotate daily to convene the leaders of the rectification groups from various units, according to the industrial transportation, financial and trade, political and legal, and cultural and educational systems, to report and study the rectification problems of each unit.

    青海省委检查各单位整风运动开展情况
    要求党员领导干部亲自动手
    新华社西宁20日电　中共青海省委员会整风领导小组办公室从5月13日起，抽派干部分别深入各单位检查整风运动的开展情况。
    几天来检查的结果说明，大部分单位都传达了省委关于开展整风运动的指示，并着手研究制定整风计划，不少单位的整风计划已经制定出来。但是，总的说来，运动开展的劲头是不大的。主要问题是多数单位的党员领导干部没有亲自动手，而把这样重要的工作交给秘书或支部书记去做；个别单位的领导干部连省委的整风指示都没有看。因此，在已经制定出来的整风计划中，大多是道理讲的多，具体办法少，检查重点不明确；有些单位只是将中央和省委的指示稍加修改就算做本单位的计划，有的单位订的计划比省委的计划还原则。由于多数单位的领导干部没有亲自动手或没有明确表示态度，很多干部甚至包括一部分中级领导干部，对整风都还存在着一定顾虑，信心不足。在整风对象方面，有些单位也不够明确。个别单位在非党干部参加整风这一问题上，还没有完全做到自愿。
    针对以上情况，中共青海省委整风领导小组最近已经先后召开会议和发出通知，要求各单位的党员领导干部，必须认真研究中央和省委关于整风运动的指示，亲自动手制定本单位的整风计划，要根据本单位的实际情况，具体分析，确定检查重点；同时要反复动员，首先表明自己的态度和决心，解除大家的顾虑，启发大家大胆揭发问题，并心平气和地研究解决问题，以达到改进工作、更加团结的目的。关于非党干部参加整风问题，一定要做到自愿参加，并且允许随时自由退出。
    从20日开始，中共青海省委第一书记高峰并将按照工业交通、财经贸易、政法、文教等系统，轮流每日召集各单位整风小组的领导人汇报和研究各单位的整风问题。
