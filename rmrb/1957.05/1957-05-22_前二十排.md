    The First Twenty Rows
    In our organization, whenever we hold evening events, the first twenty rows are always designated as seating for cadres at the division chief level and above. But in reality? When the event begins, these twenty rows are always sparsely occupied, mostly by the wives, children, old ladies, and nannies of these division chief-level cadres and above. And those of us ordinary cadres who arrived early can only sit behind them, "sighing at the stage from afar." It's especially hard on me with my nearsightedness; I rushed here only to get a seat in the twenty-first row.
    Alas! Why can't the leading cadres in an organization sit together with the ordinary cadres for some "mingling with the people"? Why can't we have "advanced comrades sit in the front of the auditorium, and those lagging behind humbly sit in the back"? It seems this bad practice really needs to be changed. (Wang Li, Xi'an)

    前二十排
    我们机关里每次举办晚会，总是前二十排划成处长级以上干部的座位。其实呢？到晚会开始时，这二十排总是稀稀拉拉的坐了一些人，其中多半是些处长以上干部的爱人，娃娃，老太太，还有保姆。而我们这些早已到会的一般干部只好坐到他们后面“望台兴叹”，特别苦了我这个近视眼，急急忙忙赶来也不过坐个二十一排。
    唉！为啥一个机关里的领导干部就不能和一般干部坐在一起来个“与民同乐”呢？为啥不能来个“先进礼堂坐前面，后进礼堂屈尊坐后方”呢？看来这个陋规大有改改的必要了。　（西安王力）
