Comprehensive report from this newspaper: Many party and government leaders in Beijing, Shanxi, Yunnan, Hubei, and other provinces and cities are engaged in physical labor alongside workers.

Beijing

Many responsible comrades from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee participated in physical labor yesterday. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, went to Zhushikou Street to repair the road; Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, also went to repair the road despite having just recovered from a major illness. As soon as Comrade Peng Zhen arrived at the road construction site, he took off his coat and began transporting stones, loading, pushing, and unloading as quickly as a young person. Peng Zhen told people that he was very familiar with physical labor, having worked in agriculture for more than ten years since he was a child. In Yan'an, many central responsible comrades and cadres went to the fields to work, and we should continue to promote this good tradition now. While working, Peng Zhen noticed that the stone pile was relatively far away and immediately discussed improvement methods with the foreman and workers. He said to Wang Shigong, the foreman of the stone section, "This is just a rationalization proposal, you can study it!" Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu and the secretaries and directors of the Municipal People's Committee were busy tidying up the site at the Post and Telecommunications Building construction site. Comrades from the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department did rough and miscellaneous work in the workshop of the No. 2 State Cotton Mill. Song Rufen, Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee's Local Industry Department, worked with the workers in the preparation workshop of the Qinghe Woolen Mill to remove impurities from the wool.

Shanxi

Dozens of responsible cadres from the Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan Municipal Party and government organs worked alongside workers for four hours on the afternoon of the 7th. At the construction site of the Workers' Cultural Palace, Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Secretary Chi Biqing were seen filling and ramming the foundation for a house that was about to be completed.

During the break, the provincial party secretaries received a letter from an employee named Zhang Yanji at the construction company, stating his opinions on the company's wage reform. Tao Lujia immediately talked to him, encouraged him to continue helping the leading cadres of the construction company overcome bureaucracy, and promised to study and deal with the opinions he raised.

Yunnan

Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, Secretaries Yu Yichuan and Ma Jikong, and responsible cadres from various departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee participated in voluntary labor to dredge the Cuihu Lake in Kunming. Driven by the secretaries, many cadres, presidents and professors of universities, and writers in Kunming also joined this labor force.

Hubei

Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Zhang Pinghua and Zhao Xinchu led more than eighty cadres, including the ministers of various departments of the Provincial Party Committee, to the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant construction site on the afternoon of the 8th to participate in physical labor such as carrying earth with the construction workers. They were very energetic during the work, and their faces were covered with sweat. Meng Futang, 62-year-old Vice Governor of Hubei Province and Minister of Culture and Education of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered bricks to bricklayers on a factory building dozens of meters above the ground, sweating profusely. The workers repeatedly asked him to rest, but he insisted on refusing, and said to the workers: It is a great honor for you to participate in the construction of China's first heavy machine tool plant, and it is nothing for us to do this little work. The leading cadres also took advantage of this physical labor opportunity to have extensive contact with the workers.

Comprehensive report from this newspaper: Party and government leaders in Shandong, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Guizhou provinces went to nearby agricultural cooperatives to help farmers with agricultural production. They mingled with the farmers, gained an in-depth understanding of the situation in the agricultural cooperatives, and promptly solved the problems that arose in their work.

Shandong

On the morning of the 5th, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Secretariat, and more than 30 other cadres led the team to the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Shili Township, Jinan Suburbs, to participate in physical labor. Within two hours, they hoeed ten mu of wheat fields on the hillside. During the break, the secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee inquired about the situation in the cooperative from the cooperative cadres and asked the cooperative to regularly assign some work to the cadres of the Provincial Party Committee organs. The cooperative cadres and members were very satisfied with the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee for leading the cadres to help them with their work. A cooperative cadre said that last year, cooperative cadres did not participate in any field labor. This year, it is stipulated that cooperative cadres only participate in three days of labor per month. It seems that the stipulated time is too short, and they are preparing to study and improve it.

Henan

Pan Fusheng, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor, Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary, Bi Zhanyun, Commander of the Henan Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and more than 40 responsible cadres from the provincial Party, government, and military organs went to the Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanzhuang Township, Zhengzhou Suburbs, to participate in physical labor together with the cooperative members. During the break, Comrade Pan Fusheng chatted with the cooperative members, and the cooperative members told him many heartfelt words, and raised many opinions on the lack of democracy of the cooperative cadres and the lack of transparency in the cooperative's economy. The Provincial Party Committee plans that from now until the wheat harvest, more than 40 cadres from provincial-level organs will go to the cooperative every day to work with the cooperative members.

Heilongjiang

Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, and others used the holiday on Sunday, the 5th, to participate in physical labor in the Guangrong Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Qiqihar City, and to investigate and study the internal contradictions of the cooperative. They talked with the cooperative cadres and members while working. Comrade Ouyang Qin also helped the cooperative cadres summarize the benefits of participating in production and leading production, and encouraged the cooperative cadres to maintain closer ties with the cooperative members. He also instructed the cooperative to vigorously develop production, strengthen political and ideological work, and improve distribution work to adjust the contradictions in various aspects within the cooperative.

Jilin

On the morning of the 8th, Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, Li Youwen, Governor of the province, Shu Xing, Deputy Commander of the Jilin Military Region, and 18 others went to the Xinglongshan Worker-Peasant Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Changchun City to sow sorghum and corn with the farmers. The directors and deputy directors of various departments of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee formed two groups and went to the Si Ji Qing and Changqing vegetable cooperatives in the suburbs to dig vegetable ponds, rake weeds, and plant seedlings.

Twelve people, including the secretary and ministers of the Changchun Municipal Party Committee and the mayor of Changchun, also participated in production at the Jinxing Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs today. While participating in production, they had cordial conversations with the cooperative director, production team leader, and cooperative members to understand the situation and problems of the agricultural cooperative. Wang Bingwen, the director of the Worker-Peasant Friendship Cooperative, told Comrade Wu De that their cooperative promoted the advanced experience of "double seedlings per hole and a handful of manure" when planting corn last year, but the effect was not very good. Some land experienced reduced production, and only one-third of the land saw increased production. Comrade Wu De asked him if he himself had participated in production and what difficulties he faced. He said that he had already participated in production this year, and it would not be a problem to work fifty labor days a year. The cooperative members of the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative also raised some opinions to the cadres participating in the labor. Some cooperative members pointed out that some workers in the city go home and pretend to be something, saying how good the workers' lives are and how bad the countryside is. They hope that the leaders will strengthen education. Some people pointed out that after the opening of the free market in the city, some cooperative members who used to be small vendors went to do business and were not at ease to work, and they hoped that they would also be managed. The comrades who participated in this labor also planned to set aside a certain amount of time in the future, with each person fixed to go to a cooperative or a factory to participate in physical labor.

Guizhou

Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, Miao Chunting and Chang Song, Secretaries of the Secretariat, Wu Jiamo, First Secretary of the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee, and leading personnel from various departments and offices of the provincial and municipal party committees, along with more than 200 cadres, went to the Nan Yue Cooperative in the suburbs of Guiyang City on the morning of the 8th to participate in labor production with the cooperative members. The secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee and others also went to the home of Wang Shengrong, the director of the cooperative, to understand the production situation in the cooperative. Miao Chunting, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said that this is just the beginning of leading cadres participating in physical labor, and it is necessary to persist in it and form a system.

Xinjiang

On the 8th, Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Saifuding, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, Aisihaiti, Vice Chairman, along with more than 180 leading cadres of all ethnic groups from various prefectural (state) committees and municipal party committees who attended the enlarged meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, came to various agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Urumqi City and worked in the fields with farmers of all ethnic groups for the whole day. Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary, chatted and laughed with the cooperative members of the Qi Dao Wan Agricultural Cooperative while waving a long-handled hoe to weed the wheat fields. He hoeed particularly carefully, and even the very small fennel weeds hiding in the wheat bushes could not escape his eyes. Comrade Wang Enmao told Yin Keqin, the township Party branch secretary next to him, "When the summer harvest comes, we will come again to help you harvest wheat." (Picture attached)

Yesterday, more than 40 cadres above the bureau and department level of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee went to the construction site of the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Building for voluntary labor. This is Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu doing the work of clearing wood.

    休息时，省委书记们接到了工地上一位名叫张延吉的职员的来信，申述他对所在的建筑公司的工资改革的意见，陶鲁笳立刻和他谈了话，鼓励他继续帮助建筑公司的领导干部克服官僚主义，还答应他将研究和处理他所提出来的意见。
