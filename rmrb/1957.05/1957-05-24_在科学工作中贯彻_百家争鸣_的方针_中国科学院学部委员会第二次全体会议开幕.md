Implementing the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" Policy in Scientific Work
The Second Plenary Session of the Academic Divisions Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Opens

(Our Newspaper) Beijing – The second plenary session of the Academic Divisions Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences opened yesterday morning at the Beijing Hotel. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening address. Guo Moruo pointed out that this meeting should fully implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," conduct criticism and self-criticism on our common scientific endeavors, and put forward constructive and specific suggestions to improve our work. He analyzed the basic tasks of the Academy of Sciences and its various academic divisions, ultimately summarizing them into four key points: First, face the whole country and strengthen academic leadership; second, promote democracy and implement the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy; third, strengthen coordination and unite scientific forces; and fourth, learn from advanced experiences and strengthen international cooperation. He also emphasized that the Party is capable of leading science. The Party's leadership in scientific administration is carried out through the concerted efforts of scientists. Regarding academic leadership, the Party will rely even more on scientists, allowing them to lead the advancement of scientific research work themselves. (Full text on page seven)

Vice President Tao Menghe then delivered a report to the meeting on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: The main work situation in the past two years and suggestions for future work. The report detailed the academic activities and scientific achievements made in the past two years. The report then pointed out that the Academy of Sciences is both an organization that actually engages in research work and an organization that unites scientists and serves as the national academic leadership center. The Academy of Sciences can strengthen its academic leadership role facing the whole country based on past experience through the following ways: First, through academic divisions, leveraging the academic leadership role of the academicians on various scientific fronts; second, through various academic societies, widely connecting the activities of the scientific community; third, relying on the research achievements and various academic activities of the research units within the Academy. Due to the current situation of China's scientific undertakings, where talent is lacking but the tasks are arduous and urgent, the report suggested that while strengthening academic leadership nationwide, it is also necessary to pay attention to strengthening close cooperation with universities and industrial sectors. The report also pointed out the importance of vigorously striving for and developing international cooperation. The report stated that in the past two years, we organized 290 scientists from various departments to visit, inspect, and study in more than 20 countries, and participated in 78 academic conferences and international academic conferences held in various countries. At the same time, we also received 268 scientists from more than 20 countries to carry out various scientific activities in our country. The report described the cooperation between the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries and China in science and the help they provided for the development of China's scientific undertakings, and said that humbly learning from the strengths of all countries in science and technology, especially learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, is always important for us. Regarding the issue of the development direction and scale of the Academy of Sciences, the report pointed out that the main development directions of the research work of the Academy of Sciences' research institutions include the following three aspects: first, major fundamental theoretical issues; second, new technical scientific fields; and third, comprehensive major research tasks. For the existing research institutions of the Academy of Sciences, adopt the principle of "strengthening key areas and providing appropriate consideration to others." The report proposed to promote the spirit of "running science diligently and thriftily," and to make appropriate arrangements for the development of various disciplines according to the country's financial and material resources, distinguishing between priorities and urgency. The report believes that: first, it is appropriate to invest more effort in the natural sciences than in the social sciences, but a certain proportion of allocation must also be maintained for the social sciences. Second, whether in the natural sciences or the social sciences, urgent needs should be strengthened, and those that are not urgently needed at present but should be prepared for early should also be given appropriate consideration. Third, emerging disciplines that have a weak foundation and are urgently needed should be strengthened; units that have laid a solid foundation and can carry out work relatively smoothly should also be given appropriate consideration. In order to promote the development of science and technology, adjust and resolve the contradictions in the development of scientific undertakings, the report finally believes that the formula of "unity – criticism – unity" should be followed, criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, and academic democracy should be promoted. This requires establishing a good atmosphere for academic criticism and academic discussion. Scientists must also conscientiously learn more about Marxism-Leninism on a voluntary basis, connect more with reality and with workers and peasants, so that they can become conscious socialist fighters. We must neither be afraid of revisionism and dare not boldly promote "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," nor be afraid of the rampant spread of dogmatism and avoid studying Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, the report believes that academic administration should also further promote democracy.

At the meeting yesterday morning, the heads of the various academic divisions reported on the work situation of each division over the past two years.

In the afternoon, the academic divisions held separate meetings. In addition to the Technical Sciences Division and the Philosophy and Social Sciences Division discussing the work of the academic divisions, the other three academic divisions read and discussed scientific papers.

More than 900 people attended the opening ceremony yesterday morning, including academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and heads of research units and administrative units of the Academy of Sciences.

Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and president of the China Political Science and Law Society, Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission, and representatives of relevant government departments also attended the opening ceremony in the morning.

    在科学工作中贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针
    中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议开幕
    本报讯　中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议昨日上午在北京饭店开幕。会议首先由中国科学院院长郭沫若致开幕词。郭沫若指出，这次会议要充分贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对于我们所共同从事的科学事业，展开批评和自我批评，提出建设性的具体建议，以便改进我们的工作。他分析了科学院和各学部的基本任务，最后把它归纳为四项要点：第一、面向全国，加强学术领导；第二、发扬民主，贯彻百家争鸣；第三、加强协调，团结科学力量；第四、学习先进，加强国际合作。他还强调指出：党是能够领导科学的。党在科学行政方面的领导是通过科学家们的通力合作来进行的，关于学术方面的领导，党将更要依靠科学家，让科学家们自己领导着科学研究工作的前进。（全文见第七版）
    陶孟和副院长接着宣读了中国科学院向会议提出的报告：二年来主要工作情况和对今后工作的建议。报告详细叙述了两年来的学术活动情况和所取得的科学成就。报告接着指出：科学院是实际从事研究工作的组织，同时又是团结科学家的组织和全国的学术领导中心。科学院可以根据以往的经验，通过以下方式来加强面向全国的学术领导作用：一、通过学部组织，发挥学部委员在各个科学战线上的学术领导作用；二、通过各学会组织，广泛联系科学界的活动；三、依靠院内各研究单位的研究成绩和各种学术活动。由于中国科学事业的现状是人才缺乏而任务却繁重紧急，所以报告建议在加强对全国学术领导的同时，还必须注意加强同高等院校和产业部门的密切合作。报告还指出了大力争取和发展国际合作的重要意义。报告说，两年来我们组织了包括各部门的二百九十位科学家先后去二十几个国家参观、访问、考察，并参加了七十八次各国召开的学术会议和国际性学术会议。同时我们也接待了二十几个国家的二百六十八位科学家来我国进行各种科学活动。报告叙述了苏联和其它兄弟国家同我国在科学方面的合作情况以及对我国科学事业发展的帮助，并说，虚心地学习一切国家科学技术上的长处，特别是学习苏联和兄弟国家的先进经验，对于我们永远是重要的。关于科学院的发展方向和规模的问题，报告指出，科学院研究机构的研究工作着重的发展方向主要有以下三方面：一、较大的基本理论问题；二、新的技术科学领域；三、综合性的重大研究任务。对于科学院已有的研究机构，采取“重点加强，相应照顾”的方针。报告提出要发扬“勤俭办科学”的精神，要根据国家的财力、物力，分别先后缓急，对各门学科的发展作适当的安排。报告认为：一、在自然科学和社会科学之间，向自然科学方面多投些力是应该的，对社会科学也必须保持一定的分配比例。二、不论自然科学还是社会科学，对于紧急的应当加强，对于眼前虽不急需、而应及早准备的，也须相应照顾。三、新兴的学科，基础薄弱、又属急需部门，应当加强；已经打好基础可以比较顺利开展工作的单位，也要相应照顾。为了促进科学技术的发展，调整和解决科学事业发展过程中的矛盾，报告最后认为应遵守“团结——批评——团结”的公式，开展批评与自我批评，发扬学术民主。这就需要树立良好的学术批评和学术讨论的风气。科学家还要在自愿的基础上认真地多学一点马克思列宁主义，多多联系实际、联系工农群众，使自己成为自觉的社会主义战士。既不要因为怕修正主义出现，就不敢放手百家争鸣，也不要怕教条主义泛滥，就回避马克思列宁主义的学习。同时，报告认为在学术行政方面也要进一步发扬民主。
    在昨日上午的会议上，各学部的负责人先后报告了各学部两年来的工作情况。
    下午，各学部分别开会，除技术科学学部和哲学社会科学学部讨论学部的工作外，其他三个学部都宣读和讨论科学论文。
    出席昨天上午开幕式的有中国科学院学部委员和科学院各研究单位和行政单位负责人等共九百多人。
    中共中央政治局委员、中国政治法律学会会长董必武，国务院副总理、科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻和政府有关部门的代表等，也出席了上午的开幕式。
