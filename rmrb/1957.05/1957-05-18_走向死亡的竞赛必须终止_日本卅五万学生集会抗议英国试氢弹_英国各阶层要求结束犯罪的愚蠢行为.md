Xinhua News Agency reports: Britain's hydrogen bomb explosion on Christmas Island and the United States' preparations for hydrogen bomb explosions in Nevada continue to be met with indignant protests and condemnations from the public and public opinion in various countries.

    Tokyo News: On the 17th, 350,000 students across Japan held rallies and demonstrations simultaneously in sixty-three cities, angrily protesting Britain's forced hydrogen bomb tests.

    In Tokyo, approximately 10,000 students from about fifty universities held a "Central Rally for the General Uprising Against the Preparation of Atomic Warfare." Representatives from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Teachers' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party participated in the rally.

    The rally passed a resolution expressing protest to the British government. The rally also passed a declaration stating that we protest the British hydrogen bomb test and demand an immediate end to such tests. We hope that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will quickly sign an agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing, and we protest a series of policies such as the United States' attempt to make Okinawa Island a permanent atomic bomb base and the dispatch of atomic mobile forces to Japan. At the same time, we firmly oppose the Japanese government possessing atomic weapons.

    After the rally, participants held protest demonstrations in front of the British Embassy and the Japanese "Defense Agency."

    Today, national and local Japanese newspapers unanimously published editorials condemning the British hydrogen bomb test and pointing out that this is a contempt for Japan's demands and world opinion.

    On the same day, the Japanese government lodged a protest with the British government regarding Britain's hydrogen bomb explosion test on Christmas Island, and demanded an immediate cessation of further tests. The Japanese government wants the British government to take full responsibility for the losses suffered by the Japanese people due to the hydrogen bomb tests, and stated that Japan reserves the right to demand compensation for such losses.

    London News: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 16th saying, "This criminal stupidity is further poisoning the air, which will bring disease to many living people and disability and death to the unborn generation."
    "Every man and woman in the country must shout louder than before and demand an immediate end to these tests. The expensive race to death must be stopped."

    The statement called for immediate and effective measures to force the government to agree to the Soviet Union's proposal to stop nuclear explosion tests together with Britain and the United States.

    The Independent Labor Party issued a statement on the same day criticizing the government's hydrogen bomb explosion and demanded that such explosion tests no longer be carried out.

    The British Women's Conference condemned the government's actions as "a crazy act" in a strong statement on the 16th. London women telegraphed the British Prime Minister saying, "Mothers cannot forgive you."

    In the House of Commons, many members of parliament demanded that the Prime Minister stop further tests.

    News of the British hydrogen bomb test caused anger and serious unease in New Delhi. On the evening of the 16th, a public meeting was held at which several Congress Party members spoke. Brahm Prakash called for public opinion to develop faster, because he believed that only organized world opinion could stop nuclear weapons testing. Congress Party member Anup Singh demanded in the Federal Assembly that Nehru convene an Asian-African conference to oppose nuclear testing and nuclear weapons. Communist Party member Raji Bahal Lal Gode, while expressing support for the proposal, also condemned the United States for arming the Taiwan Kuomintang group and Japan with nuclear weapons.

    The "Times of India" and the "Hindustan Times" and other newspapers emphasized the need for major powers to reach an international agreement to ban such tests and weapons.

    Jakarta's "Republic Daily" published an editorial on the 17th, condemning Britain for dropping the first hydrogen bomb on Christmas Island, ignoring the opposition of people around the world. The editorial also accused the United States of testing hydrogen bombs in Nevada, stockpiling atomic weapons, and supplying missiles to NATO and Chiang Kai-shek. The editorial pointed out that these actions are in preparation for an atomic war.

    The "People's Daily" also published an editorial saying that Britain's action directly threatens the lives of human beings. The editorial said that in this situation, the people of Indonesia and the world can only strengthen the struggle to demand a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs and to demand gradual disarmament.

    Canberra News: Australian Labor Party leader Evatt, when commenting on the British hydrogen bomb test on the 17th, once again called for a worldwide ban on atomic and hydrogen bomb testing.

    Evatt said that Britain did not consult with Australia and New Zealand about the timing of its hydrogen bomb test, which was a "shocking thing." He believes that "this means that Australia's international status is gradually being weakened to the point of insignificance." (Attached picture)

    日本卅五万学生集会抗议英国试氢弹  英国各阶层要求结束犯罪的愚蠢行为
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国在圣诞岛和美国准备在内华达州举行的氢弹爆炸，继续受到各国公众和舆论的愤慨的抗议谴责。
    东京消息：日本全国三十五万名学生17日在六十三个城市一齐举行了大会和示威游行，愤怒地抗议英国强行试验氢弹。
    在东京，约有五十所大学的约计一万个学生举行了“反对准备原子战争总奋起大会中央集会”。日本工会总评议会、日本教职员工会、国营铁道工会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、社会党、共产党都派代表参加了大会。
    大会通过了对英国政府表示抗议的决议。大会还通过宣言说，我们对英国试验氢弹的行为表示抗议，要求立即停止这种试验。我们希望英、美、苏三国迅速签订禁止试验核武器的协定，并且对美国企图使冲绳岛成为永久性原子弹基地和派遣原子机动部队到日本等一系列的准备原子战争的政策，表示抗议。同时，我们也坚决反对日本政府拥有原子武器。
    会后，参加大会的人们到英国大使馆和日本“防卫厅”前面举行了抗议示威。
    日本全国性的和地方性的报纸今天一致发表社论谴责英国试验氢弹，并且指出这是对日本的要求和世界舆论的一种蔑视。
    同一天，日本政府就英国在圣诞岛氢弹爆炸试验向英国提出抗议，并且要求立即停止进一步试验。日本政府要英国政府对日本人民由于氢弹试验所受到的损失负完全的责任，并且表示日本将保留要求赔偿这种损失的权利。
    伦敦消息：英国共产党政治委员会16日发表声明说，“这种犯罪的愚蠢行为更进一步地毒化了空气，这种空气将给许多现在活着的人带来疾病，给尚未出生的一代带来残废和死亡。”
   “全国每一个男女必须比以前更响亮地大声疾呼和要求立即停止这些试验。昂贵的走向死亡的竞赛必须终止。”
    声明号召立刻采取有效措施来迫使政府同意苏联的同英国和美国一起停止核爆炸试验的建议。
    独立工党同日发表声明指责政府爆炸氢弹的行动，并且要求不再进行这种爆炸试验。
    英国妇女大会16日在一篇强硬的声明中谴责政府的作法是“一个疯狂的行动”。伦敦妇女打电报给英国首相说，“母亲们不能宽恕你”。
    在下院，有许多议员要求首相停止进一步的试验。
    英国进行氢弹试验的消息在新德里引起了愤怒和严重的不安。16日晚上，人们举行了公众大会，有几个国大党议员在会上讲了话。布腊姆·普腊卡什要求舆论发展得更快，因为他认为只有有组织的世界舆论才能制止原子核武器试验。国大党议员阿纽普·辛格在联邦院里要求尼赫鲁召开亚非会议来反对原子核试验和原子核武器。印度共产党议员拉志·巴哈拉尔·戈德在表示支持这项建议的时候，还谴责美国用核武器来武装台湾国民党集团和日本。
   “印度时报”和“印度斯坦时报”以及其他报纸都强调各大国有必要达成国际协议以禁止这种试验和武器。
    雅加达“共和国报”17日发表社论，谴责英国不顾全世界人民反对，在圣诞岛投下了第一颗氢弹。社论也指责美国将在内华达试验氢弹，囤积原子武器，并且以导弹供给北大西洋公约组织和蒋介石。社论指出，这些行动是在准备原子战争。
   “人民日报”也发表社论说，英国的这一行动直接威胁了人类的生活。社论说，在这种情况下，印度尼西亚和全世界人民只有加强要求完全禁止原子弹和氢弹和要求逐步裁军的斗争。
    堪培拉消息：澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特17日在评论英国试验氢弹事情的时候，再次呼吁在世界范围内禁止原子弹和氢弹试验。
    伊瓦特说，英国没有同澳大利亚和新西兰商量过它举行氢弹试验的时间，这是一件“令人震惊的事”。他认为，“这意味着实际上澳大利亚的国际地位逐渐地削弱到无足轻重。”（附图片）
