Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th: The key project on the Nanping-Fuzhou railway line—the large iron bridge across the Min River—was fully completed on May 18th.

　　This large iron bridge, more than 480 meters long, is the largest bridge engineering project on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway. The soldiers of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army overcame various construction difficulties during the two rainy seasons and flood periods in the south, creating favorable conditions for the continued laying of tracks on the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway.

　　By the end of this year, this railway will be completed to Eyang Station, about 70 kilometers away from Nanping. Eyang is an important wharf on the main stream of the Min River. After the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway is connected here, it can be connected with the night navigation channel of the main stream of the Min River and the highway leading to the Gutian mountainous area, forming a land-water transportation line.

    横跨闽江的大铁桥建成
    新华社福州26日电　南平—福州铁路上的关键工程——横跨闽江的大铁桥，在5月18日全部建成。
    这座四百八十多公尺长的大铁桥是鹰厦铁路和南福铁路上最大的桥梁工程。中国人民解放军铁道兵的战士们曾战胜了南方两个雨季洪水期的各项施工困难，为南福铁路继续向前铺轨造成了有利条件。
    今年年底，这条铁路将修通到距离南平约七十公里的莪洋车站。莪洋是闽江干流上的一个重要码头，南福铁路通到这里后，就可以和闽江干流的夜航航道和通向古田山区一带的公路相衔接，形成一道水陆运输线。
