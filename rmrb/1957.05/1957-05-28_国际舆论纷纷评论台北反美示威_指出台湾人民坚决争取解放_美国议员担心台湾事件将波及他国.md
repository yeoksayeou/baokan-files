(Xinhua News Agency Report) News from Xinhua: The Taipei incident has become the focus of international attention. Newspapers from various countries have published comments supporting the anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" said on the 27th that the uprising of the Taiwanese people was the result of the masses being unable to tolerate the atrocities of the American aggressors and an outburst of mass resentment towards the American aggressors. This clearly demonstrates the determination of the Taiwanese people to strive for national liberation from humiliation. This is also a head-on blow to the American aggressors.

The commentary said that the uprising proves that the Taiwanese people have deeply felt the consequences of American aggression and that only by uniting against the American aggressors and returning Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland can they embark on the road to freedom and happiness.

The Romanian "Scînteia" pointed out on the 26th that the Taiwanese people's attack on the U.S. Embassy was not a simple act against the atrocities of the American occupiers. This action proves that the people of Taiwan—an inseparable part of Chinese territory—are determined to get rid of American rule and enslavement. The greater significance of this incident lies in the fact that it occurred when the American aggressor bloc was creating tension in the Far East and sending missile units to Taiwan. Facts have proved that even in places where imperialism considers itself most secure, there is instability. This land is burning under the feet of the American aggressors.

The commentary believes that the strong desire of the Taiwanese people to break free from American enslavement and the determination of all Chinese people to liberate Taiwan are indestructible.

The Cairo "Al-Shaab" said in an editorial on the 27th that the Taiwanese masses "know that People's China has made great progress and demand to rejoin the motherland." It also said: "Nine million Taiwanese cannot be indefinitely isolated from their 600 million compatriots. The Taiwanese have been waiting since 1950, and now they have begun to take action, and sooner or later they will be victorious."

The Jakarta "Dong Xing Daily" said on the 27th that it has long been known that American occupation forces are unpopular everywhere. The Taiwan incident tells the Indonesian people that they must adhere to independence and autonomy.

The Bangkok "Universal Daily" warned the Thai government about the danger of allowing more American troops to enter Thailand when commenting on the anti-American incident in Taiwan on the 27th.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, Washington: U.S. congressmen continue to discuss the Taiwan incident. Two Democratic leaders believe that this large-scale anti-American demonstration may be a "prelude to anti-American sentiment" breaking out in many other parts of the world.

Senate Democratic Deputy Leader and Foreign Affairs Committee member Mansfield said, "The events in Taipei and Japan may well foreshadow similar events occurring in other parts of the world where U.S. troops are stationed."

Representative Zablocki, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Far Eastern Affairs and a Democrat, also said he firmly believes that the demonstration was by no means accidental. Zablocki said that one of the factors that has caused trouble for the United States is that the anger in many countries stems from locals feeling that Americans are extravagant and disregard local culture.

Senator George Smathers cited the Taiwan incident to support his demand to cut the government's proposed foreign aid funds. Smathers said that the United States has given Taiwan 2.5 billion US dollars in military aid and 775 million US dollars in economic aid, yet "they still hate the United States." He said that Congress now realizes that our large sums of money in various parts of the world "may be being spent incorrectly."

    国际舆论纷纷评论台北反美示威
    指出台湾人民坚决争取解放
    美国议员担心台湾事件将波及他国
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：台北事件已成为国际舆论注意的中心。各国报纸纷纷发表评论，支持台湾人民的反美斗争。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”27日说，台湾人民的这次起义，是群众对于美国侵略者的暴行不能再忍受下去了，是群众对美国侵略者积愤的爆发。这清楚地表现了台湾人民争取民族解放不受屈辱的决心。这也是对美国侵略者的当头棒喝。
    评论说，这次起义证明，台湾人民已经痛切地感到美国侵略的后果，感到只有一致起来反对美国侵略者，使台湾迅速地回到祖国的怀抱，才能走上自由幸福的道路。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”26日指出，台湾人民对美国大使馆的攻击并不是一个简单地反对美国占领者的暴行的行动，这个行动证明台湾——中国领土的不可分割的一部分——的人民坚决要求摆脱美国的统治和奴役。这次事件更大的意义在于它是在美国侵略集团为制造远东的紧张局势、把导弹部队派到台湾的情况下发生的。事实证明，即使在帝国主义认为最有把握的地方也是不稳定的。这块土地在美国侵略者的脚下燃烧起来了。
    评论认为，台湾人民要挣脱美国奴役的强烈愿望，和全中国人民要求解放台湾的决心是不可摧毁的。
    开罗“人民报”27日在社论中说，台湾群众“知道人民中国已经取得了巨大的进步，并且要求重新归属于祖国”。又说：“九百万台湾人不能够无限期地被置于同他们六亿同胞隔离的境地，台湾人从1950年以来一直在等待，现在他们已经开始行动起来了，他们迟早会胜利的。”
    雅加达“东星报”27日说，美国占领军到处不得人心是久已闻名的。台湾事件告诉印度尼西亚人民一定要坚持独立自主。
    曼谷“永恒报”27日在评论台湾发生的反美事件的时候，对于允许更多的美国军队进入泰国的危险性向泰国政府提出警告。
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会议员们继续对台湾事件议论纷纷。两个民主党议员领袖认为，这次反美大示威可能是世界其他许多地区爆发“反美情绪的预兆”。
    参议院民主党副领袖和外交委员会委员曼斯菲尔德说，“台北和日本的事件很可能预示驻有美国军队的世界其他地区可能发生类似事件。”
    众议院关于远东事务的外交小组委员会主席、民主党人扎布洛基也说，他坚信，这次示威事件决不是任何一个意外的结果。扎布洛基说，美国遭到麻烦的因素之一是，许多国家的愤怒出于当地人觉得美国人穷奢极欲和无视当地文化。
    参议员乔治·斯马特斯引证台湾事件来支持他要求削减政府提出的援外经费的主张。斯马特斯说，美国给了台湾二十五亿美元的军事援助和七亿七千五百万美元的经济援助，然而“他们仍然憎恨美国”。他说，国会现在认识到，我们在世界各处付出大笔款子“可能是作得不对的”。
