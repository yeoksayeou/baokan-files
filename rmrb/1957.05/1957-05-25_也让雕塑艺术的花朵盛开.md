Let the Flowers of Sculpture Art Bloom Too
    The editorial department of this newspaper has received several submissions from sculptors, who have raised some issues regarding the current state of sculpture work and requested that cultural leaders pay attention to them. Now, we are publishing excerpts from these submissions as follows:

    There Should Be a Plan
    Lin Jiachang:
    Our sculpture work is encountering many urgent problems on its path of development. The first is the lack of comprehensive planning by relevant departments. Of course, we cannot build many monuments at the same time, but it is necessary to formulate a general plan. For example, which monuments to revolutionary martyrs and ancient scholars should be built in the first batch, the second batch, the third batch...? Publishing this would allow sculptors to design monument models around the plan and hold creative competitions, which would improve the quality of art.

    The Ministry of Culture lacks the necessary support for the nascent seedling of sculpture. For example, the "China Sculpture Factory" led by the Ministry of Culture has been under preparation for three years, and even a factory building of 800 square meters has not been built yet. A group of young sculptors have to work under makeshift tarpaulin sheds, which are as stuffy as steamers in summer and freezing cold in winter. Comrades have to comfort themselves with "it's always good to have work to do." Isn't it? Many sculptors are still idle!

    Is there no need for sculptors at present? Anhui Province wanted to sculpt a four-foot-high statue of Comrade Peng Xuefeng, but could not find a sculptor, so they had to ask a folk artist who sculpts Buddhist statues to do it. As a result, the proportions were not correct, it didn't look like him at all, and it collapsed before it was completed, also killing a worker, causing loss of life and economic damage. In this way, on the one hand, the sculptors trained by the state are idle and have nothing to do, and on the other hand, sculptors cannot be found. This situation should be changed.

    Secondly, our sculpture is still considered a waste, so architects and gardeners dare not use sculpture to beautify urban buildings and parks, and the general construction budget does not include a budget for sculpture. For example, the auditorium of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League originally planned to set up a group sculpture of young people "marching towards socialism" on the roof during the design, but the leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League said that there was no funding, and said: "You are all members of the League, so do volunteer work." But even the cost of sculpture materials was not available, so it had to be abandoned.

    Forgotten by Architects
    Ding Jiejin, Gao Yunlong:
    The tasks facing sculptors at present are arduous and complex. All sectors of society do not understand sculpture art, the general public is not familiar with it, the leading departments do not pay attention to it, and the sculpture circle itself is not strong. Therefore, the development of sculpture art has been greatly hindered.

    In ancient China, sculpture art was very developed. The ancient grottoes and statues, as well as the many excellent Buddhist statues in temples, all show how rich our sculpture heritage is. At the same time, the combination of sculpture art and architecture in our country in the past was also very common and very developed. Taking the Forbidden City and the Thirteen Tombs as examples, the decorative sculptures that match the architecture are so beautiful and attractive. Unfortunately, our sculpture art has declined and can be said to have been interrupted for a long time. Our current architects have also forgotten the decorative value of applying sculpture art to architecture. Why not use sculpture to make some of our buildings more magnificent? Why not use sculpture to make our parks more beautiful and majestic? Why not use sculpture to establish cultural and artistic embellishments on our city's roads and squares?

    Sculpture is a kind of decoration that can produce great results without spending a lot of money. Especially commemorative sculpture, it is the most educational and the most commemorative permanent art. Sculpture art is often an important symbol of measuring a country's prosperity and cultural level. Under our superior social system, it is very necessary to revive our country's sculpture art.

    Working for Free and Losing Money
    Wang Bingzhao:
    Since liberation, the Party and the government have raised the sculpture cause to its proper position and demanded that the sculpture cause move forward by leaps and bounds. But it still cannot change people's old views of underestimating sculpture art. Even some leaders of units regard sculpture works as inferior to ordinary objects. Because of this incorrect thinking, they are often very rushed when commissioning sculpture work. "Only caring about the harvest, not asking about the cultivation" is their portrayal. Now, I will only talk about some examples I have come into contact with:

    Around 1952, the teachers of the sculpture department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts were entrusted by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Literature and Art to create many statues of leaders, which ended without results. The Beijing Film Studio also mobilized the teachers of the entire department to create a group sculpture of "workers, peasants and soldiers" for the opening of films. Everyone actively participated, and finally one was selected, and only the material costs were paid (Editor's note: Recently, the factory has given the author appropriate remuneration). During the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, a relevant unit commissioned several teachers of the sculpture department to create a sculpture group of "Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting side by side" more than two meters high. When most of it was completed, the unit suddenly said it didn't want it anymore, and even the labor and material costs were not paid. Before the opening of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in order to decorate the venue, a relevant unit entrusted a teacher of the sculpture department to create two large reliefs with the theme of workers, peasants and soldiers, and said that they would send some gifts to the author as a souvenir, but later it disappeared. Also, we can see various reproduced statues of leaders everywhere in the market (almost all craft shops in the country have these statues), but according to one writer who created the most statues of leaders, he has never received any remuneration.

    I myself have personally experienced some similar things: The Beijing People's Art Theatre invited me to create a bust of Lenin, larger than life, for the performance of "Moscow Character". Afterwards, I was given a ticket in the last row of the balcony, which was considered polite in comparison. Once, a unit of the State Council asked the Central Academy of Fine Arts to make a circular relief of Mr. Li Xijiu with a diameter of 30 centimeters. At that time, the leader of the sculpture department of the Academy of Fine Arts, in order to take care of my financial difficulties, specially assigned me to do this work, but as a result, I lost the labor and material costs. Later, I saw this statue at the Babaoshan Cemetery, which had been cast in bronze and installed in front of Mr. Li Xijiu's tomb. In 1953, the Miscellaneous Goods Export Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade accepted a batch of commemorative badge orders from the Mongolian People's Republic and asked me to rush to make two relief images of Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan as blueprints. I sacrificed rest, shortened sleep, and completed this task. They made tens of thousands of commemorative badges based on my work, and I lost the labor and materials again. The year before last, I replicated a half-length statue of General Fan Zhuxian, larger than life, for a historical museum in Shandong Province. I helped them pack and ship it, and the freight was reimbursed. The technician and material costs were also reimbursed for dozens of yuan. As for myself, I didn't get any remuneration, but I was criticized in a letter from them, saying that they didn't need these material costs.

    It is too difficult to be a sculptor. I hope that the leading departments will take concrete measures, formulate a remuneration system for sculpture creation, and build several simple and practical personal studios to rent to them for a long time to ensure the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in the sculpture cause.

    The Threat of Changing Careers
    Ying Zhenhua:
    I have been threatened with changing careers for more than two years since graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts. In recent years, a considerable number of students who graduated from the sculpture departments of art colleges in various places have indeed changed careers and semi-changed careers. It is understood that out of the eighteen graduates of the Northwest Art College in recent years, fifteen have changed careers or semi-changed careers. It is also estimated that about half of the only 160 or so sculptors in the country have changed careers or semi-changed careers. Several sculpture students who graduated from the Central South Academy of Fine Arts last year have not yet been assigned work. The leading comrades in the fine arts department of the Ministry of Culture said: In the absence of sculpture work, it is still necessary to change careers. Some leading comrades blindly emphasize that there is not much sculpture work, and ask everyone to make more models and coat racks, while also blindly criticizing young sculptors for underestimating folk sculpture and small sculpture and other "popularization work", but it is rare to hear encouragement. It is said that the Ministry of Culture wants to decentralize the newly organized Shanghai Sculpture Team, but the Shanghai Cultural Bureau is unwilling to accept it. Like kicking a ball, the work team has been in a state of no leadership for more than half a year, causing many difficulties. It can be seen that the development direction of sculpture art and the training policy for young sculptors are very unclear.

    Find a Way Out for Sculpture
    Wang Hongwen:
    Sculpture works have to go through the author's hard work and spend money (material costs, etc.) to complete. After completion, in addition to participating in exhibitions, there are very few other uses, at most a photo is published in newspapers and periodicals. Of course, there are also a few that are displayed in memorial halls and other places, but most of them have to be collected in basements or storage rooms. Over time, it becomes too crowded to store them, so they are simply taken out and destroyed. Some authors, because the only way out for sculpture is to publish photos in newspapers and periodicals, can get some royalties and make round sculptures on only one side. After the photo is taken, the photo is published, and the work is destroyed. How can we talk about the prosperity of creation when sculptors are in such a situation?

    Therefore, I think it is necessary to solve the problem of the way out for sculpture.

    We must open up places where sculpture works can often meet with the masses. For example, in cultural palaces, parks, etc., build several pedestals for displaying works, display sculptures, let the masses appreciate and criticize them, and gradually make sculpture art a part of the masses' cultural life.

    We must establish a national acquisition system to acquire good sculpture works, keep them in custody and display them, which is also accumulating cultural wealth for the country.

    We must formulate a reasonable remuneration system to encourage sculptors to actively and wholeheartedly create better works.

    We must rationally arrange and use sculpture talents and organize them to meet the requirements of the country. The work assigned to graduates of the sculpture departments of various art colleges has cases of using what they have not learned and failing to make the best use of their talents, which should be corrected immediately.

    Hold a National Sculpture Conference
    Zhang Youmin, Zhang Xinzheng:
    The sculpture team is still very weak. But the problem now is that even this weak team cannot fully play its role. The current situation is: sculptors are needed when sculpture is needed, but no one cares when sculptors can't find work. People engaged in sculpture have nothing to study. No one organizes them if they want to go to various places to see ancient and folk sculptures; no one convenes a national sculptor's conference. China, with a population of 600 million, does not have a sculpture magazine. Many sculptors do not have the opportunity to create or the conditions to create. Their tools are rusty. If this continues, even the level that everyone thinks is "not enough" today will decline day by day.

    Some people advise sculptors to wait before changing careers because there is no place to use their talents, saying that the work in the future will never be finished. But we don't understand why the work that will never be finished should be left to the future? What is the crux of the matter that sculpture flowers cannot bloom in today's Hundred Flowers Bloom?

    It is hoped that the Ministry of Culture can convene a "National Sculpture Work Conference" in the near future, widely gathering sculptors, folk sculptors, architects and representatives of relevant departments from all departments of the country to discuss the existing problems in sculpture art together. This will not only solve some problems, but also strengthen the cooperation and contact between all parties in order to clarify the principles and tasks of sculpture work and formulate a specific plan for the sculpture cause.

    Let This Flower Also Bloom
    Lü Xitang, Wang Dajin:
    In order to make sculpture art get the due development, we believe that:

    First, there should be a plan for developing the sculpture cause, first of all, a plan for commemorative sculpture. Secondly, the plan should also include indoor easel sculpture, small sculpture, and decorative sculpture. To develop easel sculpture and small sculpture, it is necessary to establish institutions for reproduction, publication and distribution. The main task is to reproduce and promote sculptures. At the same time, it is necessary to solve the difficulties in creation and the problem of the way out for works, such as giving authors creative loans, works purchased by the state, etc. As for decorative sculpture, the main problem is that the units in charge of construction should allocate a certain percentage of the construction costs for decorative sculpture and require architects to cooperate with sculptors.

    Second, is the problem of people. On the one hand, the working conditions of sculptors are very poor, and some sculptors with considerable talent do not have studios; some sculptors have too many social activities and do not have enough time to create. On the other hand, some people who used to be engaged in sculpture and are now doing other work should be allowed to return to the team. At the same time, the work of graduates of the sculpture departments of art schools should be properly assigned.

    Third, we must expand the social influence of sculpture art, such as holding exhibitions, running publications, reproducing and publishing sculpture works, etc. In addition, sculpture works should be displayed in cultural palaces, clubs, etc., and specialized art exhibition halls can be considered in large cities.

    Let this bright and magnificent flower of sculpture art also bloom under the sunshine of the Party's literary and artistic policy!

### 也让雕塑艺术的花朵盛开

专栏：

    也让雕塑艺术的花朵盛开
    本报编辑部先后收到好几位雕塑工作者的来稿，他们对当前雕塑工作中存在的问题提出了一些意见，要求文化领导部门加以重视。现在，我们把来稿摘要发表如下：
    应该有个规划林家长：
    我们雕塑在发展的道路上，碰到了许多急待解决的问题。首先是有关部门缺乏全面的规划。当然，我们不可能在同一时期建立许多纪念碑，但是拟定一个大体的规划是必要的。例如第一批要建立哪些烈士纪念碑和古代学者纪念碑，第二批、第三批……把它公布出来，这样可使雕塑家围绕着计划，设计纪念碑模型，进行创作竞赛，这样可以提高艺术质量。
    文化部对雕塑这新生的幼苗缺乏应有的扶植。例如文化部领导的“中国雕塑工厂”，已经筹建了三年，至今连八百平方公尺的一个厂房都还没盖成，一群青年雕塑家只好在搭起的油布棚下工作，夏天闷得像蒸笼，冬天冷得要命。同志们只好用“有工作做总是幸福的”来安慰自己。可不是吗？许多雕塑工作者还闲着哩！
    目前不需要雕塑工作者吗？安徽省要塑一座彭雪枫同志的四尺高的雕像，找不到雕塑家，只好请一位塑造佛像的民间艺人来做，结果做得不合人体比例，根本不像，而且尚未完成就垮了，还砸死了一个工人，造成生命和经济的损失。这样，一方面国家培养出来的雕塑人材闲着没事做，一方面却又找不到雕塑工作者，这种情况是应该加以改变了。
    其次，我们的雕塑还被认为是一种浪费，因此，建筑师和园艺家们不敢采用雕塑来美化城市建筑和公园，一般的建筑费预算中也都没有雕塑的预算。例如团中央的礼堂，在设计时原拟在屋顶上设置一座“向社会主义迈进”的青年群像，但团中央领导同志说没有经费，并说：“你们都是团员，就义务劳动吧。”可是连雕塑材料费也没有，结果只好落空。
    被建筑家们忘记了丁洁因　高云龙：
    目前摆在雕刻工作者面前的任务是艰巨复杂的。对于雕刻艺术，社会各界不了解，人民大众不熟悉，领导部门不重视，雕刻界本身力量也不雄厚。因此，雕刻艺术的发展，遭到了很大的阻碍。
    在我国古代，雕刻艺术是很发达的。我们看到古代留下来的一些石窟和石像，以及庙宇中很多优秀的佛像，都可以说明我们有多么丰富的雕刻遗产。同时，我国过去以雕刻艺术配合建筑，也是很普遍和很发达的，就以故宫、十三陵来说，其配合建筑的装饰雕刻是多么的美丽引人。可惜，我们的雕刻艺术后来却衰落了，也可说长期中断了。我们现在的建筑家们，也都忘记了在建筑上应用雕刻艺术的装饰价值，你看，为什么不用雕刻来使我们某些建筑变得更辉煌壮丽呢？为什么不用雕刻来使我们的公园变得更优美雄伟呢？为什么不用雕刻来使我们城市的马路、广场建立起文化艺术的点缀呢？
    雕刻是不费大钱而能出大效果的一种装饰，尤其是纪念性的雕刻，是最富有教育意义和最富有纪念性的永久性的艺术。雕刻艺术往往是衡量一个国家繁荣富裕和文化水平的重要标志，在我们优越的社会制度下，复兴我国的雕刻艺术是非常必要了。
    白尽义务还赔钱王丙召：
    解放以来，党和政府已经把雕刻事业提到应有的地位，要求雕刻事业大踏步前进。但仍改变不了人们轻视雕刻艺术的旧观点，甚至有些单位的领导人，把雕刻作品看得连一件普通器物都不如。因为有这种不正确的思想在作祟，他们委托雕刻工作时，往往是很急促的，“只事收获，不问耕耘”，正是他们的写照。现在仅就我个人接触到的一些例子来谈谈：
    约在1952年间，中央美术学院雕塑系的先生们，曾应北京市文艺处之托，创作领袖像多座，无结果而终。北京电影制片厂也发动过全系的先生们创作电影片头“工农兵”群像，大家都积极参加了，最后当选了一座，仅付了材料费（编者按：最近该厂已补给作者以适当报酬）。抗美援朝运动中，某有关单位托雕塑系的几位先生创作“中朝战士并肩作战”的两米多高的雕刻群像，到大部完成时，这个单位忽然说不要了，而且连工料费都不给。全国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议开幕前，为了装饰会场，有关单位曾托雕塑系一位先生创作两块以工农兵为题的大浮雕，并表示将送点礼物给作者留个纪念，后来也烟消云散。还有，在市面上我们到处可见各种翻制的领袖雕像（这种雕像全国的工艺商店几乎都有），但据创作这些领袖像最多的一位作家说，他从没有得到过什么报酬。
    我本人也亲历过一些类似的事情：北京人民艺术剧院为演出“莫斯科的性格”，曾邀我创作一座比真人还大的列宁胸像，事后给了一张楼座最后排的戏票，比较起来这总算彬彬有礼了。有一次，政务院某单位要中央美术学院给李锡九先生作一个直径三十公分的圆浮雕像，当时美术学院雕塑系领导，为照顾我生活困难，特把这项工作交我担任，可是结果我反赔了工料费，后来我在八宝山公墓看到这个像已翻铜安装在李锡九先生的墓前。1953年吧，对外贸易部杂品出口公司接受了蒙古人民共和国的一批纪念章定货，托我赶制苏赫巴特和乔巴山的两个浮雕像作蓝本，我牺牲了休息，缩短了睡眠，完成了这个任务，他们根据我的作品制作了上万枚纪念章，而我又赔上工料。前年给山东省某历史博物馆复制了一座大于真人的范筑先将军半身像，我帮他们包装托运，运费是实报实销，技工和材料费也报销了几十元，至于我个人呢，没有得报酬，反被他们来信责难，说用不了这些材料费。
    作雕刻家太难了，希望领导部门采取具体措施，制定雕刻创作的稿酬制度，盖几间简朴适用的个人工作室，长期租给他们，以保证“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策在雕刻事业中实现。
    改行的威胁应真华：
    从美术学院毕业到现在两年多，一直受着改行的威胁。几年来，各地美术院校雕塑系毕业的同学，的确有相当一部分改行和半改行了。据了解，西北艺专几年来十八个毕业同学就有十五个改行或半改行。又据估计，全国仅有的一百六十个左右的雕塑工作者，改行和半改行的约有半数。中南美专去年毕业的几个雕塑同学，至今还未分配工作。文化部美术方面的领导同志说：在没有雕塑工作可做的情况下，还是要改行。一些领导同志一味强调雕塑工作不多，叫大家多搞些模型、衣架子，同时还一味批判青年雕塑工作者轻视民间雕塑、小雕塑等“普及工作”，却难得听到鼓励。据说文化部要把刚组织不久的上海雕塑工作队下放，但上海文化局却不愿接受，就像踢皮球一样，半年多来工作队就一直处于无领导的三不管状态下，造成很多困难。可见雕塑艺术的发展方向和对雕塑青年的培养方针都是很不明确的。
  给雕塑找找出路王鸿文：
  雕塑作品要经过作者辛苦劳动并花钱（材料费等）才能完成，完成后，除参加展览会之外，极少有别的用处，至多在报刊上发表一张照片。当然也有少数被陈列在纪念馆等地方，但大部分却只好收藏到地下室或储藏室里去了。日久天长，挤放不下了，便干脆拿出来打掉。有的作者，因为雕塑的出路只有报刊上发表照片这一条，还可以稍得些稿费，作圆雕就只作一面，拍下照片来，照片发表了，就把作品打掉。雕塑家处在这样的情况下，如何谈得上创作的繁荣呢？
    因此，我认为必须解决雕塑的出路问题。
    要为雕塑作品开辟经常与群众见面的场所。例如在文化宫、公园等处，修几个陈列作品的座台，陈列雕塑，让群众欣赏、批评，使雕刻艺术逐渐成为群众文化生活中的一部分。
    要建立国家收购制度，收购好的雕塑作品，加以保管和陈列，这也是为国家积累文化财富。
    要制定合理的稿酬制度，以鼓励雕塑家积极安心地创作更好的作品。
    要合理地安排和使用雕塑人材，把他们组织起来，以适应国家的要求。各美术院校雕塑系毕业生被分配的工作，有用非所学和不能人尽其材的情况，应即纠正。
    召开全国雕塑会议张友民　张心正：
    雕塑的队伍现在还很薄弱。但现在的问题是，连这支薄弱的队伍都还不能充分发挥他们的作用。目前的情况是：需要雕刻的时候要雕刻家，雕刻家找不到工作却没有人过问。搞雕塑的人没有东西研究，愿意到各地看看古代的和民间的雕刻，也没有人组织；全国雕塑家的会议没人召开。六亿人口的中国却没有一本雕塑杂志。许多雕塑工作者没有创作的机会和进行创作的条件，他们的工具都长了锈，长此以往，连今天大家认为“不够”的水平也将每况愈下了。
    有人劝告雕塑家且慢因用武无地而改行，将来的活儿是做不完的。可是我们不明白，为什么做不完的活儿却要留待将来呢？不能在百花齐放的今天让雕塑之花也开放起来的症结究竟在哪里？
    希望文化部能在最近召开一次“全国雕塑工作会议”，广泛地将全国各部门的雕塑工作者、民间雕塑艺人、建筑师和有关部门的代表会集一堂，把雕塑艺术方面存在的问题提出来共同商讨，这样，不仅可以解决一些问题，而且可以加强各方面的配合和联系，以明确雕塑工作的方针任务，具体地订出雕塑事业的规划来。
    让这朵花也能盛开吕希棠　王大进：
    要使雕刻艺术得到应有的发展，我们认为：
    第一，要有一个发展雕刻事业的规划，首先是纪念性雕刻的规划。其次，规划中也应该包括室内的架上雕刻、小型雕刻，以及装饰性雕刻。发展架上雕刻和小型雕刻，须建立翻制出版和发行的机构，主要的任务是将雕刻品复制推广。这里同时要解决在创作时的困难，以及作品的出路问题，例如给作者以创作贷金，作品由国家收买等等。至于装饰性雕刻，主要问题是：主持建筑的单位应在建筑费用中划出一定的比例数作为装饰雕塑之用，并要求建筑家与雕刻家合作。
    第二，是人的问题。一方面，目前雕刻工作者工作条件都很差，某些具有相当才能的雕刻家都没有工作室；有些雕刻家社会活动过多，没有足够的创作时间。另一方面，一些过去曾经从事雕刻而现在在干旁的工作的人，应使之归队。同时，美术学校雕塑系毕业生的工作应妥善分配。
    第三，必须扩大雕塑艺术的社会影响。如开展览会，办刊物，翻制、出版雕刻作品等等。此外，在文化宫、俱乐部等处应陈列雕塑作品，在大城市可考虑设立专门的美术陈列馆。
    让雕塑艺术这朵鲜艳壮丽的花，也能在党的文艺方针的阳光普照下盛开！
