Beijing News Circles "Contend"!

    This newspaper reports that Beijing's news circles began yesterday to "contend" on urgent issues in news work. The news work forum, jointly convened by the Research Department of the All-China Journalists Association, the Journalism Department of Peking University, and the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, was held in Beijing on the morning of the 16th. More than 200 news workers from Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Shanxi and other places attended the meeting.

    Zhang Liqun said: Now newspapers actually bear the responsibility of bulletin boards, gramophones, pirated books and "stirring up troubles."

    Zhang Liqun, editor-in-chief of China Youth Daily, talked about the question of who the newspaper is responsible to, and how newspaper workers realize their responsibility. He believes that the current newspapers actually bear the responsibilities of bulletin boards, gramophones, pirated books and "stirring up troubles," which makes the subordination of news workers very large and unable to think independently. He then talked about the issue of newspaper criticism. He said that China Youth Daily published a lot of critical articles, and many people disagreed. They said that Youth Daily only needs to educate young people well, and should not meddle in other people's affairs. This makes the comrades of the newspaper shrink back.

    Zhang Liqun advocated that newspaper news should be first. For example, China Youth Daily issued earlier some explanations of current affairs policies and news of national construction. Others accused us of saying that this is a bourgeois style. In fact, the quality of news is first reflected in time.

    He said that reporters of China Youth Daily encountered great difficulties in interviews. Young readers' demands are diverse, and reporters should conduct interviews in many aspects. However, reporters run into snags everywhere they go, and many places cannot enter the door.

    Zhang Liqun talked about the art of newspaper propaganda. He said that China Youth Daily sometimes pays attention to the color of the layout, and sometimes does not pay attention to art, and is not attractive. Someone advised them not to turn the newspaper into an embroidered pillow, which looks good on the outside but is a bag of grass inside. However, they believe that paying attention to being lively is always very important.

    Wang Zhong said: We are still like during the Anti-Japanese War, treating newspapers as weapons of class struggle.

    Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University in Shanghai, introduced the situation of "contending" and "letting bloom" in the Shanghai news circles at the meeting. Then he expressed his personal opinions on news work. He said that the students of the Journalism Department of Fudan University once discussed the contradiction between Party spirit and authenticity, mass character, interest and ideology. Wang Zhong said: "I don't see any contradiction between interest and ideology, interest only contradicts dogmatism."

    Wang Zhong believes that some Party committees now regard newspapers as tools for issuing their own orders and opinions, forgetting that newspapers are still things for people to obtain knowledge and news. He said that a newspaper wanted to run a literary supplement, but the Party committee disagreed, saying that it had no ideology; what is the actual situation? The Party committee said this in the office, but they still read it when they go home. Because he is an individual. Wang Zhong believes that with the changes in society, the nature and function of newspapers should also change. However, we are still like during the Anti-Japanese War, treating newspapers as weapons of class struggle. He said: "Newspapers are for people to read. If people find them boring and uninteresting and cannot read them, then what kind of class character is there?"

    He said that generally speaking, the interview conditions for reporters after liberation are much better than before liberation, but the interview ability of reporters is lower. Reporters should try every means to interview things that others cannot get.

    Mo Rujian said: Newspapers should have political and ideological nature on the one hand, and commodity and comfort on the other.

    The third speaker was Mo Rujian, a teacher in the Journalism Department of Renmin University. He said that the nature and function of newspapers have not been resolved yet. The Party committee believes that the newspaper represents the Party and the government, so it talks about Party spirit and excessively emphasizes that the newspaper is a textbook, always conveying orders from top to bottom. He said that Lenin said that "a newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer." But that was said in 1901, when the class struggle was very sharp, and it was right to put forward this slogan. Now, mechanically executing it like this will suppress everyone's enthusiasm.

    Mo Rujian said that the bourgeois newspapers have already solved the contradictions in their newspapers. Their newspapers are commodities, which make people feel comfortable to read, and also tell readers some strange things, satisfying people's curiosity and increasing knowledge.

    He believes that newspapers should have political and ideological nature on the one hand, and commodity and comfort on the other.

    Zheng Baitao, a reporter from China News Agency, said that news should serve society universally. He said that news is objectively happening, and not everything is related to class. Reporters can be allowed to publish their own opinions freely.

    Gu Zhizhong said: Some people reflect that reporters of People's Daily are arrogant and never ask old reporters for advice.

    The old journalist Gu Zhizhong sharply criticized sectarianism in news work. He said: Many old reporters from Shanghai's Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao have nothing to do with Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government and imperialism, but they were all fired after liberation. A new news library was established, which became a nursing home for these people, and of course they have a lot of opinions. Now people do not respect old reporters. Some people reflect that reporters of People's Daily are arrogant and never ask old reporters for advice.

    Gu Zhizhong believes that there are theories in all subjects now, but there is no news theory. Many people say that news has class character, but there is nothing to refer to. He said: "News content has class character, news arrangement does not have class character." Think about it, "Why can bourgeois newspapers be run lively, but socialist newspapers cannot?"

    Gu Zhizhong advocated that reporters should grab news. "Grabbing news is definitely not a bourgeois thing." Any news, as long as it is not a military secret or a diplomatic secret, can be grabbed. Now many important things are published after a few days, making readers' thoughts paralyzed.

    Yang Chongye said: If reporters are always criticized, how can they work actively? Many reporters did not write news after liberation because Xinhua News Agency uniformly issued manuscripts.

    Yang Chongye, a reporter from Wenhui Daily, mainly expressed his opinions on the phenomenon that news reporters do not write news. He said: Now there is very little news in the newspapers, and it is very boring. Some people then said that our country's news reporters have lost their news sensitivity.

    "In the era of Kuomintang rule, of course there was no freedom of the press. But reporters drilled very vigorously. Now many people do not understand the tasks of reporters and do not support the work of reporters." "If reporters are always afraid of being criticized, how can they work actively?" Yang Chongye said that many reporters did not write news after liberation because Xinhua News Agency uniformly issued manuscripts. With such a unified system of Xinhua News Agency, reporters from various newspapers have nothing to do; the writing style has also changed, and the writing of news is all old-fashioned.

    Yang Chongye believes that sectarianism in news work is serious. The Party regards Party newspapers as its own sons, and non-Party newspapers are at most adopted sons.

    Yang Chongye criticized the Journalists Association, saying that it is the Head Association of Journalists, and there is not a single ordinary editor or reporter among the responsible persons.

    Zou Zhen said: Freedom of the press has been deprived by bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism.

    When Zou Zhen, a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, spoke, he began by saying: "Freedom of the press has been deprived by bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism." "Now there is still no contending in the news field, and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee should open a green light."

    Zou Zhen believes that the formulaic phenomenon in the news issued by Xinhua News Agency is very serious. "Various newspapers first rejected, then did not use, this should be regarded as a good phenomenon."

    Now many news units are becoming bureaucratic, with many levels and overlapping institutions. Editors and reporters who can write and edit have become "officials," and work efficiency cannot be seen here.

    The old journalist Zhang Henshui spoke last at the forum on the 16th. He emphasized that news should be new and fast. Now many news begins with "since a few months," this is not news, it is history.

    "We often see that a reporter does not write a piece of news for a month. But he is very busy, what is he busy with?"

    The forum will continue today.

### 北京新闻界“鸣”起来了

专栏：

    北京新闻界“鸣”起来了
    本报讯　北京新闻界昨天开始就新闻工作中的迫切问题“争鸣”。中华全国新闻工作者协会研究部、北京大学新闻学专业和中国人民大学新闻系联合召开的新闻工作座谈会，16日上午在北京举行。参加会议的有北京和上海、辽宁、山西等地新闻工作者二百多人。
    张黎群说：现在报纸实际上担任了布告牌、留声机、翻版书和“惹事生非”的责任。
    中国青年报总编辑张黎群谈到了报纸对谁负责，报纸工作者如何实现它的责任的问题。他认为现在的报纸实际上担任了布告牌、留声机、翻版书和“惹事生非”的责任，使得新闻工作者的从属性很大，没法独立思考。他接着谈到报纸的批评问题。他说，中国青年报登了不少批评稿件，许多人很不以为然。他们说，青年报只要把青年教育好了就行了，不要多管闲事。这就弄得报馆的同志们缩手缩脚。
    张黎群主张报纸的新闻应该抢先。比如，对一些时事政策的解释和国家建设的消息，青年报过去发的早了些。别人责难我们说，这是资产阶级作风。其实新闻质量高低，首先表现在时间上。
    他说，青年报的记者在采访中遇到很大的困难。青年读者的要求是多方面的，记者就应该进行多方面的采访。可是，记者出去到处碰钉子，好多地方进不了门。
    张黎群谈到报纸的宣传艺术。他说，青年报有时注意版面的色彩，有时又不讲究艺术，不吸引人。有人劝他们不要把报纸搞成绣花枕头，外面好看，里面是一包草。可是，他们认为，讲究生动活泼总是很重要的。
    王中说：我们现在还像抗战时期一样，把报纸当作阶级斗争的武器。
    上海复旦大学新闻系主任王中在会上介绍了上海新闻界开座谈会“鸣”“放”的情形。接着发表个人对新闻工作的意见。他说，复旦大学新闻系的同学曾经讨论党性和真实性、群众性，趣味性和思想性的矛盾问题。王中说：“我看趣味性和思想性中间没矛盾，趣味性只和教条主义有矛盾。”
    王中认为，现在有些党委把报纸看成下达自己的命令和意见的工具，忘记了报纸还是人民获得知识和消息的东西。他说，有一个报纸要办个文艺副刊，党委不同意，说这没有思想性；实际上怎么样呢？党委在办公室这样说，回到家去还是要看。因为他是个人。王中认为，随着社会的变化，报纸的性质和作用也要变化。可是，我们现在还是像抗战时候一样，把报纸当成阶级斗争的武器。他说：“报纸是为了叫人看的，如果人家觉得没意思，没兴趣，看不进去，那还有什么阶级性呢？”
    他说，总的讲来，解放后，记者的采访条件比解放以前好多了，但记者的采访能力却低了。记者应想尽方法采访人家搞不到的东西。
    莫如俭说：报纸一方面应有政治性、思想性，一方面还应有商品性、舒服性。
    第三个发言的是人民大学新闻系教员莫如俭。他说，报纸的性质和作用到现在还没有解决。党委认为报纸是代表党和政府的，所以讲党性，过分强调报纸是教科书，总是自上而下地传达命令。他说，列宁说过“报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且还是集体的组织者”。但那是在1901年时候说的，那时候阶级斗争很尖锐，提这个口号是对的。现在再这样机械地执行那就压制了大家的积极性。
    莫如俭说，资产阶级的报纸已经解决了他们报纸的矛盾问题。他们的报纸是商品，叫人看起来舒服，还告诉读者一些奇怪的东西，满足了人们的好奇心，增加了知识。
    他认为报纸一方面应有政治性、思想性，一方面还应有商品性、舒服性。
    中国新闻社记者郑白涛说，消息要为社会普遍服务。他说，消息是客观发生的，不是每一件事都与阶级有关。可以放手叫记者发表自己的意见。
    顾执中说：有人反映，人民日报记者自高自大，从不向老记者请教。
    老报人顾执中尖锐地批评新闻工作中的宗派主义。他说：上海申报、新闻报许多老记者，同蒋介石反动政府和帝国主义并无关系，可是在解放以后全被辞掉了。新设立了一个新闻图书馆，成为这些人的养老院，他们当然很有意见。现在人们都不尊重老记者。有人反映，人民日报记者自高自大，从不向老记者请教。
    顾执中认为现在各科都有了理论，可是新闻学还没有。许多人都说新闻有阶级性，可是没有东西可以参考。他说：“新闻内容有阶级性，新闻编排没有阶级性”。想想看，“为什么资产阶级的报纸能够办的生动活泼，社会主义的报纸却作不到呢？”
    顾执中主张记者要抢消息。“抢消息绝对不是资产阶级的东西”。任何消息，只要不是军事秘密和外交秘密，都可以抢。现在许多重要事情要隔几天才发表，弄得读者的思想也麻痹了。
    杨重野说：记者如果总是挨整，怎么能够积极工作呢？解放后许多记者不写新闻，是因为新华社统一发稿。
    文汇报记者杨重野主要针对新闻记者不写新闻的现象发表意见。他说：现在报纸上新闻很少，又很枯燥。有人于是就说，我国的新闻记者已经失去新闻敏感性了。
   “在国民党统治时代，当然没有新闻自由。可是记者钻的很起劲儿。现在许多人对记者的任务不了解，对记者的工作不支持。”“记者如果总是怕挨整，怎么能够积极工作呢？”杨重野说，解放后许多记者不写新闻，是因为新华社统一发稿。新华社这么一统，各报记者就没事作了；文风也变了，新闻的写法都是老一套。
    杨重野认为新闻工作中的宗派主义是严重的。党把党报看成亲生儿子，非党报纸顶多是螟蛉义子。
    杨重野批评新闻记者协会，说那是新闻记者首长协会，在负责人中间没有一个普通的编辑、记者。
    邹震说：新闻自由被官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义剥夺了。
    新华社记者邹震发言的时候，开头就说：“新闻自由被官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义剥夺了。”“现在新闻方面还没有鸣，中宣部应该开放绿灯。”
    邹震认为：新华社发的新闻，公式化的现象很严重。“各个报纸先是拒绝，后是不用，这应该看作是一种好现象。”
    现在许多新闻单位衙门化，层次很多，机构重叠。能写能编的编辑、记者都做了“官”，在这里看不到工作效率。
    老报人张恨水在16日的座谈会上最后发言。他强调新闻要新、要快。现在许多新闻开头就是“几月以来”，这不是新闻，是历史。
   “我们经常看到，一个记者一个月不写一条新闻。可是他又很忙，到底忙些什么呢？”
    座谈会将在今天继续举行。
