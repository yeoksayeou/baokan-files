Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Ministry of Culture and the Publishing Administration Bureau, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, invited the heads of several publishing houses in Beijing to discuss the current problems in publishing work. At the meeting, they criticized some of the shortcomings of the Ministry of Culture's leadership in publishing work.

Currently, there is widespread criticism that publications are both scarce and of poor quality, and that the quantity and quality of publications do not meet readers' needs. The heads of these publishing houses pointed out that the main reason for this phenomenon lies in the system, that is, the "grand unification" approach of printing, publishing, and distribution is no longer suitable for the new situation of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." This kind of "unification," on the one hand, exercises excessive control and rigid management over publishing affairs, and on the other hand, it cannot truly "unify" in terms of coordination, thus constantly breeding bureaucracy and causing many chaotic phenomena. Feng Xuefeng, the director of the People's Literature Publishing House, said that the current publishing leadership work has created typical bureaucracy in this typical environment.

Feng Xuefeng said:

	Publishing Houses Seem Like Government Offices

Feng Xuefeng believes that it is necessary to study the essence of the current problems in the publishing industry, study the publishing work's guidelines and tasks based on China's specific conditions, and fundamentally change the current publishing work's system and institutions. He said that according to normal logic, printing and distribution should serve publishing. However, the current printing, publishing, and distribution are unified into separate systems, which in fact has formed a situation of "distribution leading publishing and printing controlling publishing." "Publishing houses are neither like publishing houses nor like business units, but seem like government offices."

Zeng Yansou said:

	Some Leaders in the Ministry of Culture Have "Too Little Culture and Too Much Martialism"

Zeng Yansou, the deputy director of the People's Publishing House, also advocated actively and thoroughly changing the publishing system and institutions in his speech. He criticized the Ministry of Culture for lacking effective guiding leadership in publishing work in recent years. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee rarely expresses systematic opinions on publishing work, and he has not seen the People's Daily and Guangming Daily publish editorials on publishing guidelines. He said: "The Publishing Administration Bureau is busy allocating paper and circling around figures and indicators, but it rarely manages the basic guidelines and main business of developing the publishing industry." Some leaders in the Ministry of Culture have "too little culture" and "too much martialism." They do not provide enough leadership to the lower levels, but always ask subordinates to conduct self-criticism, using "martial" methods to lead publishing work.

Zeng Yansou also criticized the People's Daily for only publishing some of his minor opinions when it published a report on the publishing work symposium not long ago, and not publishing his opinions on the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the Ministry of Culture. Feng Xuefeng also pointed out that the report on the publishing symposium published in the People's Daily did not reveal the essence of the problems in publishing work.

Wang Renshu said:

	Publishing Houses Frequently Change, Merging Soon After Dividing and Dividing Soon After Merging

Wang Renshu, the deputy director of the People's Literature Publishing House, and Chang Zizhong, the deputy director of the Finance and Economics Publishing House, both emphasized that developing the publishing industry must attach importance to the beneficial experiences of China's publishing industry tradition. Wang Renshu pointed out that the current "grand unification" system in the publishing industry actually neglected the excellent traditions of the past in the process of transforming the old publishing houses. Chang Zizhong pointed out that the Ministry of Culture's policy was not clear enough and hesitant when reorganizing the original Zhonghua Book Company. For example, the Zhonghua Book Company was first changed into the Finance and Economics Publishing House, and then the Zhonghua Book Company was separated out again because the central government pointed out that the tradition of the Zhonghua Book Company should be valued. Now it is merged with the Ancient Books Publishing House again. As a result, one unit hangs three signs, the original advantages of the Zhonghua Book Company have been neglected, many experienced old publishing workers have not been able to fully play their role, and many chaotic phenomena have appeared in the work. Chang Zizhong said: "The old saying goes, 'After a long period of division, there must be unity; after a long period of unity, there must be division.' There is also the word 'long.' Our publishing houses merge soon after dividing, and divide soon after merging."

Lan Yu said:

	It's Not About Changing Without Chaos
	But About Chaos Without Change

Lan Yu, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Popular Reading Publishing House, believes that the current situation is that on the one hand, the Ministry of Culture controls publishing work too rigidly; on the other hand, it is "unified without being unified." The Ministry of Culture can only unify a few directly affiliated publishing houses, and it actually cannot "unify" the national publishing houses. Due to unified printing, publishing houses do not have their own printing plants, so it takes two or three months for the Popular Reading Publishing House to print a cover in Beijing, while a local publishing house in Shandong Province that is not "unified" only takes more than 20 days to print a popular booklet. He also pointed out that the current practice of publishing houses dividing work according to specialties is also worth studying. Doing so results in manuscripts being kicked around, writers being pulled around, and the quality of publications being reduced. Lan Yu also disagreed with some leaders' saying that they should "change without chaos" when discussing improving publishing work. Lan Yu said that the actual situation in the publishing industry is chaotic, and the problem is not "changing without chaos," but "chaos without change." Of course, the spirit of "bold exploration and careful action" should be grasped in the process of change.

Lan Yu also put forward suggestions for improving publishing work. He suggested thoroughly rectifying and strengthening state-owned publishing houses, opening up some private publishing houses, and thoroughly changing the current publishing business management institutions to make them more efficient and truly grasp the publishing work's guidelines and policies, and adjust the relationship between publishing houses. The internal system of publishing houses should be determined according to the characteristics of cultural work. In addition, an organization like an association jointly composed of various publishing houses should be established to manage the specific affairs in publishing work.

The heads of publishing houses who attended the meeting also criticized the Ministry of Culture for being too strict in managing the personnel work of publishing houses, valuing seniority but neglecting virtue and talent, so that people could not be used to their full potential. The负责人of Xinhua Bookstore also criticized the Ministry of Culture for its subjectivism in formulating book publishing plans. Due to blind planning, the Xinhua Bookstore had a total of 170 million yuan worth of books and periodicals in stock last year, and it is estimated that the value of the overstocked books and periodicals accounts for one-third of this. Last year, the Ministry of Culture specifically stipulated that the Xinhua Bookstore should print more than 50 million copies of five kinds of books, such as pamphlets on publicizing agricultural cooperation. However, about half of them are now overstocked in warehouses.

This symposium was held in Beijing from the 9th to the 11th. The Ministry of Culture will also invite writers and experienced old publishing workers to discuss the problems in the publishing industry and solicit opinions.

### 对出版事务“统的过多”“管的过死”  各出版社负责人座谈出版工作中的问题

    对出版事务“统的过多”“管的过死”
    各出版社负责人座谈出版工作中的问题
    本报特约新华社专稿　文化部和出版事业管理局结合整风，邀请北京的几个出版社的负责人座谈目前出版工作中的问题，他们在会上对文化部领导出版工作的一些缺点提出了批评。
    目前社会上都指责出版物又缺又滥，认为出版物的数量、质量都不能满足读者需要。这些出版社负责人指出，形成这种现象的主要原因在于体制，也就是印刷、出版、发行“大一统”的办法已经不适合于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”新形势的需要。这种“统一”，一方面对出版事务统的过多、管的过死，另一方面在关系协调上又不能真正 “统”起来，因而不断滋生着官僚主义，造成许多混乱现象。人民文学出版社社长冯雪峰说，目前的出版领导工作，就是在这种典型环境中造成了典型的官僚主义。
    冯雪峰说：
    出版社好像是衙门
    冯雪峰认为，必须研究当前出版界问题的实质，根据我国的具体情况，研究出版工作的方针任务，从根本上改变目前出版工作的制度和机构。他说，按着正常的道理，印刷和发行都应当为出版服务。但目前印刷、出版、发行各成系统地统一起来，事实上形成了“发行领导出版，印刷控制出版”的局面，“出版社既不像出版社，又不像企业单位，好像似衙门”。
    曾彦修说：
    文化部有的领导人“文化太少武化太多”
    人民出版社副社长曾彦修在发言中，也主张积极、彻底地改变出版的体制和机构。他批评几年来文化部对出版工作缺少切实的方针性的领导。中宣部也很少对出版工作表示系统的意见，没看到人民日报和光明日报发表过关于出版方针的社论。他说：“出版事业管理局忙于分配纸张，围着数字、指标打圈圈，但对发展出版事业的基本方针和主要业务却很少管”。文化部有的领导人“文化”太少、“武化”太多，对下边领导不够，却总要下级检讨，用“武化”办法来领导出版工作。
    曾彦修还批评人民日报不久以前发表关于出版工作座谈会的稿件时，只登了他提的一些次要意见，没有把他对中宣部及文化部的意见登出来。冯雪峰也指出，人民日报刊登的出版座谈会的稿件，并没有揭露出出版工作问题的实质。
    王任叔说：
    出版社经常变动合不久就分分不久又合
    人民文学出版社副社长王任叔、财经出版社副社长常紫钟都强调发展出版事业必须重视我国出版界传统的有益经验。王任叔指出，目前出版界“大一统”的体制实际上是在改造旧的出版社过程中忽视了过去的优秀传统。常紫钟指出，文化部在改组原中华书局时，方针不够明确，举棋不定。如先把中华书局改成财经出版社，后因中央指出应重视中华书局传统，又把中华书局单独分出。现在又同古籍出版社合并，结果一个单位挂了三个招牌，中华书局原有的优点被忽视了，许多有经验的老出版工作者没有能充分发挥作用，工作中呈现出不少混乱现象。常紫钟说：“古语说‘分久必合，合久必分’，还有一个‘久’字。我们的出版社则是合不久就分，分不久又合。”
    蓝钰说：
    不在于变而不乱
    而在于乱而不变
    通俗读物出版社副总编辑蓝钰认为现在的情况，一方面是文化部对出版工作统的太死；一方面又是“统而不统”。文化部只能统几个直属出版社，对于全国的出版社，实际上“统”不起来。由于统一印刷，出版社没有自己的印刷厂，以致通俗读物出版社在北京印一个封面要两三个月，而山东省没有被 “统”的一个地方出版社印一本通俗小册子却只要二十多天。他还指出，目前出版社按专业分工的做法也值得研究，这样做，稿子踢来踢去，作家被拉来拉去，刊物的质量降低了。蓝钰还不同意有些领导人在讨论改进出版工作时提出应该“变而不乱”的说法。蓝钰说，目前出版界的实际情况就是混乱的，问题不在于“变而不乱”，而是“乱而不变”。当然，在改变中应掌握“大胆探讨，慎重从事”的精神。
    蓝钰还提出了改进出版工作的建议。他建议彻底整顿和加强国营出版社，开放一些私营出版社，彻底改变现在的出版事业管理机构，使它更有效率，真能掌握出版工作的方针政策，调整出版社间的关系。应按文化工作的特点来确定出版社内部的体制。此外，还应建立一个由各出版社联合组成的协会之类的组织，管理出版工作中的具体事务。
    到会的出版社负责人还批评了文化部对出版社的人事工作管的过严，重资历而轻德才，以致不能人尽其用。新华书店的负责人也批评了文化部在制定出书计划上的主观主义。由于盲目计划，去年新华书店积存的书刊共值一亿七千万元，估计积压的书刊的价值占其中的三分之一。文化部去年具体规定新华书店对宣传农业合作化的小册子等五种书籍印五千多万册。但是现在有半数左右积压在仓库里。
    这次座谈会是9日到11日在北京举行的，文化部还将分别邀请作家以及有经验的老出版工作者座谈出版界的问题，征求意见。
