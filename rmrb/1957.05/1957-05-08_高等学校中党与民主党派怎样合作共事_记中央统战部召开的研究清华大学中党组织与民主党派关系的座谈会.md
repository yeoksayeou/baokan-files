How the Party and Democratic Parties Should Work Together in Universities
-- A Record of the Symposium Held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee to Study the Relationship Between the Party Organization and Democratic Parties at Tsinghua University
　　This reporter
    Based on Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," what should be the position and tasks of the grassroots organizations of democratic parties in universities, under the general premise of mobilizing all positive factors to run schools well? Based on the principle of respecting the independence and equality of democratic parties, what should be the relationship between the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party and the grassroots organizations of democratic parties in universities? In order to study this series of questions, starting in late April, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, together with the Tsinghua University Committee of the CPC, the Central Committee and municipal organizations of the China Democratic League, the Central Committee and municipal organizations of the Jiusan Society, and other parties, formed a ten-person investigation team to conduct an investigation at Tsinghua University for approximately two weeks. During this period, the members of the investigation team widely contacted people from all walks of life, especially members of democratic parties and non-party professors, to listen to and exchange opinions. After the investigation, on the 6th and 7th of this month, Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee presided over a symposium attended by all relevant parties. The participants included Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University and Secretary of the Tsinghua University Party Committee; Min Ganghou, Deputy Director of the Organization Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Li Yi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society; Chen Shihua, Head of the Tsinghua Branch of the China Democratic League and Vice President of Tsinghua University; Zhang Shouyi, Head of the Tsinghua Branch of the Jiusan Society; and responsible persons and representatives from the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Higher Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, the Central Committees of various democratic parties, and the Ministry of Higher Education.

    The results of this investigation and the speeches at the symposium proved that the cooperative relationship between the Party and the democratic parties at Tsinghua University is basically normal. The Party-Party Joint Conference in the school has played a certain role in discussing and studying some major issues in the school. In the adjustment of departments, teaching reform, ideological remolding, and the anti-reactionary movement, the democratic parties have done some work, gradually establishing prestige among the masses, and their organizations have also developed. In recent years, the relationship between Party members and non-Party members has improved. After the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, members of democratic parties were greatly encouraged, and the idea that "democratic parties should be abolished" was dispelled. Moreover, recently, the Party and the democratic parties are further developing towards a closer cooperative relationship.

    However, the results of the investigation and the speeches at the symposium also proved that at Tsinghua University, there are still many problems, large and small, in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members in the past and even now.

    Three of the Five Lines Are Not Properly Placed
    Some people call the five organizational systems in the school the "five-line staff," comparing them to five lines. These five lines are: the Communist Party, administration, democratic parties, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. Of the five lines, three are not properly placed. The Party committee system has played a significant role in various tasks, but it has managed too much. Some Party members have also thickened this line. A deputy department head said: Some young Party members do not show enough respect to others. The decisions of the department cannot be implemented unless they are arranged through the Party system. Many things are studied well within the Party, then handed down to be done, emphasizing understanding the "leadership's intentions" rather than studying them together with the masses. If more consultation and discussion with democratic parties could be done on many tasks, they would feel that it is their own thing, have a sense of political responsibility, and it would be more conducive to the work.

    The administrative system, from the president down, is described as a dotted line by some. In the past, many things were decided by the Party committee and passed down to the Party branch through the Party general branch, and the Party branch then instructed the department head through the department secretary (mostly young Party members), forming a situation where the department secretary led the department head. Some people feel that this working method is inappropriate. Some issues could be known by the department heads one step earlier, and they could know more.

    The situation of the democratic party system is: from the perspective of individuals, each member plays a role, but from the perspective of organizational role, it is vague, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing. Some people mentioned that in the Department of Power for several years, the shadow of the democratic parties was not seen on the blackboard newspaper or in other aspects. The Party's leadership of the democratic parties is not enough. For example, the Department of Architecture has older teachers, and the Party hopes that the organization of the Democratic League will do some work for these older teachers, but rarely studies the work with the members of the League. In the department and the teaching and research section, it is not clear what role the democratic parties should play. Some members of the Jiusan Society said: Ordinary members have no tasks and feel that joining the society is about the same as not joining. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will do a good job in the group work and be given some tasks.

    Regarding the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League systems at Tsinghua University, some people say that they are relatively normal.

    Not Only Participate in "Construction" but Also Participate in "Design"
    The problem is laid out: the positions of the five lines are not correct. How to correct them? That is to say, how can the leadership of the Party be implemented in the work, and at the same time, the administrative and democratic party organizations can play a greater role? At the symposium, the Party's responsible comrades at Tsinghua University put forward some preliminary opinions. They quoted a member of a democratic party, which is: "Open the door, equal rights, compete fairly, keep if good, discard if not." That is what another member of a democratic party said, "Rest assured" and "Let go." In the past, the opinions of members of democratic parties were solicited on some major issues of the school, but members of democratic parties only participated in "construction" but not in "design," only participated in "performance" but not in "rehearsal." This is because the importance of the work of the democratic parties has not been thoroughly recognized. Some Party members used to think that the relationship with the democratic parties was no longer a problem, and the members of the democratic parties had all been properly arranged, but they did not or rarely considered what kind of working relationship should be adopted with the democratic parties in the work. What specific measures will be taken in the future to change this situation? This is: 1. Strengthen the role of the Party-Party Joint Conference. Major issues of the school are not discussed by the Party in advance, but are directly submitted to the Party-Party Joint Conference for discussion, allowing everyone to fully express their opinions. Each department can also consider establishing a department-level Party-Party Joint Conference according to the specific situation and needs. The leadership system of the school can also be based on the Party committee leadership system in the future, absorbing all parties to participate together. 2. Strengthen the role of the administrative system. Major issues of the school are discussed and decided by the school affairs committee, and major issues of each department are discussed and decided by the department affairs committee, and implemented. 3. Require department secretaries and Party members who do other administrative work to overcome the simplistic style of work. 4. Request support from democratic parties in various tasks.

    How Can Democratic Parties Play an Organizational Role?
    To adjust the relationship between the Party, administration, and democratic parties, it is also necessary to solve the issue of the position and tasks of the grassroots organizations of democratic parties in universities. Is the relationship between the Party and non-Party members an independent and equal relationship? Or is it a relationship of leadership and being led? On this issue, many people believe that, except for accepting the ideological leadership of the Communist Party, democratic parties are equal to the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party in other aspects; its basic task in the school is the same as that of the grassroots organizations of the Communist Party, which is to mobilize all positive factors to run the school well. However, this involves the following question: How can the organization of the democratic parties play its organizational role?

    Some people believe that it is necessary to first strengthen the self-ideological remolding of members of democratic parties. Only with good ideological remolding can one's own organization be in an equal position with the Communist Party in terms of theory and ideological level, and the role played will be greater. For example, some people have always had a sense of inferiority, thinking that Communist Party members are politically stronger than themselves, and do not believe that they can play any role; some people are afraid of being criticized for wrong supervision and dare not supervise; some people are accustomed to relying on the help of the Communist Party in everything, lacking the spirit of independent thinking and independent responsibility, and even have to ask the Party committee for instructions on where to hang a banner. Obviously, these problems need to be solved through ideological remolding. Some people also believe that to strengthen the organizational role, it is necessary to strengthen the role of leadership, hoping that the leading institutions of democratic parties can put forward specific requirements to their members at any time based on the central issues in the school. Still others believe that if the grassroots organizations of democratic parties are to play a role, the leaders of the Party must be given time to study Party affairs leadership work. Now, the persons in charge of the grassroots organizations of democratic parties mostly bear great responsibilities in education administration and teaching and research. They originally have very little time to study Party affairs work, and some routine work in Party affairs takes up the little time they may be able to spare. Therefore, it is hoped that the school can help them solve these problems, or consider reducing the other work tasks of comrades who are engaged in Party affairs work. Some people also believe that members of democratic parties should participate more in various administrative organizations and mass organizations in the future, so as to play a role in more aspects and embody the rights and obligations of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the Communist Party.

    Making Friends Heart to Heart
    Regarding the relationship between Party members and non-Party comrades, it was mentioned that in the past at Tsinghua University, it was not normal enough. Party members do not or rarely go to the homes of non-Party comrades, and non-Party comrades also do not or rarely go to the homes of Party members. Everyone has concerns. What are the concerns? When Party members go to the homes of non-Party comrades, they are afraid of being suspected of checking their actions; when non-Party comrades go to the homes of Party members, they are afraid of being said to be "flattering." Between each other, it can be said that there is only political connection but no emotional connection. Even among non-Party comrades, there is little interaction. During the Spring Festival, no New Year's greetings are ever made. The school calls for group visits, but many people do not go, because they feel that there is little contact at ordinary times, and a large group visit during the New Year is too formal. Some people mentioned that some Party members are too serious in their style, making people feel out of place.

  "Party members only come to talk when there is something to do." Some old professors are willing to talk about everything with Party members who were once his students, but are unwilling to talk deeply with ordinary Party members. Therefore, many people hope that Party members and non-Party comrades should have more contact; "A thousand cups of wine are not enough when you meet a confidant, and half a sentence is too much when you don't hit it off," "friendship issues" are very important, and friends should talk heart to heart and have the feelings of friends, so that they can truly achieve close cooperation. Recently, this situation has improved.

    Some Opinions of Comrade Li Weihan
    At the symposium, Minister Li Weihan made a speech in response to some of the issues raised in the investigation materials and everyone's talks. He mentioned that the cooperative relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is a very common relationship. The issue of members of democratic parties having duties, powers, and responsibilities in their work was raised by the Party a long time ago. After the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward last year, all democratic parties demanded to play a greater role. The issue of "from design to construction and inspection" mentioned in this investigation at Tsinghua University is a manifestation of this desire. This is correct and should be affirmed.

    Some of our Party member comrades do not have a correct estimate of the role of the democratic parties. The democratic parties have generally had a long-term cooperative relationship with us, and the path they have taken is developing forward according to the laws of social development, and they have played a leading role in the class and stratum they represent.

    Democratic parties are now basically political groups of senior intellectuals. Senior intellectuals are very important in our country. They are teachers for future generations, and they are a strong force in the current construction projects. They should combine with workers, and workers must also combine with them. Therefore, we should attach importance to democratic parties and trust them politically. Ideologically and academically, we should allow contention and release, relieve some pressure, and overcome sectarianism within the Party. Only on this basis can we remove the gap between Party members and members of democratic parties.

    In order to implement this political line, organizational work should obey its requirements. There are many issues worth considering in the relationship between Party groups and administration in institutions and schools, as well as confidentiality systems and personnel systems.

    The Tsinghua issue we are talking about now is only one aspect of the relationship with senior intellectuals. The decisions made by the school affairs committee may be inconsistent with the opinions of the Party committee. The Communist Party can propose a plan at the school affairs committee, the democratic parties can also propose a plan, and individuals can also propose it. In short, we must act according to the opinions of the majority. Will this eliminate the Party's leading role? I think, on the contrary, by listening to the opinions of the masses more, the leading role will be more substantial.

    Working only in the school affairs committee is not enough. The Communist Party must also do United Front work, and through various contacts, communicate the relations of all parties and solve the obstacles in the cooperation.

    After these problems are solved, we must also solve the issue of the attitude of Communist Party members. There are many young people among the Communist Party members in the faculty and staff of Tsinghua University. They should "worship teachers, make friends, be open and honest, and learn with humility" from the old professors.

    Comrade Li Weihan finally said that his opinions are proposed for everyone's reference and are not a conclusion. He also suggested that the leaders of Tsinghua University and all parties jointly study some solutions to the problems, formulate some systems, and gradually solve the existing problems.

    高等学校中党与民主党派怎样合作共事
    ——记中央统战部召开的研究清华大学中党组织与民主党派关系的座谈会
  　本报记者
    根据毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，以及“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，在调动一切积极因素办好学校的总前提下，民主党派基层组织在高等学校中的地位和任务应该怎样？根据尊重民主党派独立平等的方针，高等学校中共产党的基层组织和民主党派的基层组织的关系应该怎样？为了研究这一系列的问题，从4月下旬开始，中共中央统战部联合中共清华大学委员会、中国民主同盟中央和市级组织、九三学社中央和市级组织以及其他方面人士共同组成十人调查组，在清华大学进行了为时约两周的调查。在这期间，调查组成员曾经广泛地和各方面人士特别是民主党派成员和无党派教授们接触，听取和交换意见。调查结束后，本月6日和7日，由中共中央统战部李维汉部长主持，召集各有关方面举行座谈。参加座谈会的有清华大学校长、清华大学党委书记蒋南翔，民主同盟中央组织委员会副主任委员闵刚侯，九三学社中央委员会副秘书长李毅，民主同盟清华支部负责人、清华大学副校长陈士骅，九三学社清华支社负责人张守仪，以及中共中央宣传部、北京市委高校党委会、各民主党派中央委员会、高等教育部负责人和代表等多人。
    这次调查结果和座谈会发言证明，在清华大学，党与各民主党派的合作共事关系，基本上是正常的。学校中的党派联席会议，在讨论研究学校中的一些重大问题中，发挥过一定的作用。在调整院系、教学改革、思想改造和肃反运动中，民主党派做了一些工作，在群众中逐渐树立威信，组织也有了发展。几年来，党与非党关系有了改进。“长期共存、互相监督”方针提出后，民主党派成员受到很大鼓舞，“民主党派要取消”的思想得到解除。而且近来，党与各民主党派正进一步向亲密合作共事的关系方面发展。
    但是，调查结果和座谈会发言同时证明，在清华大学，党与非党关系过去以至现在也还有着大大小小许多问题。
    五条线有三条线摆得不正
    有人把学校中的五种组织系统称作“五线谱”，比做五条线。这五条线是：共产党，行政，民主党派，工会和青年团。五条线，三条摆得不妥当。党委系统在各项工作中起了很大作用，但是，管得多了些。有些党员也加粗了这根线。一位副系主任谈到：有些年青的党员，对别人尊重不够。系的决定不通过党的系统布置就行不通。许多事情，党内研究好，交下来就做，让着重体会“领导意图”，而不是和群众一起研究。如果许多工作能多同民主党派商量讨论，就能使他们感到是自己的东西，有一种政治责任感，更有利于工作。
    行政系统，从校长以下，有人形容为虚线。过去，许多事情，是由党委将决定经由党总支下达到党支部，党支部再通过系秘书（多是年青的党员），向系主任布置，形成系秘书领导系主任。有人觉得，这种工作方法是不合适的。有些问题完全可以让系的负责人先知道一步，多知道一些。
    民主党派系统的情况是：从个人来看，每个成员都起着作用，但从组织作用来看，是若有若无，时隐时现。有人谈到，在动力系几年，黑板报上和其他方面，连民主党派的影子也看不到。党对民主党派的领导作得不够。如建筑系有年长的教师，党希望民主同盟的组织对这些年长教师做些工作，但很少和盟员研究工作。在系里和教研室里，看不出民主党派要起甚么作用。九三学社有的社员说：普通社员，没有甚么任务，感到入社和不入社差不多。因此希望大家做好小组工作，和交给一些任务。
    在清华大学，工会和青年团系统的工作，有人说他们是比较正常的。
    不仅要参加“施工”也应当参加“设计”
    问题摆出来了：五条线的位置不正。怎样摆正呢？也就是说，怎样在工作中既能贯彻党的领导，又能使行政和民主党派组织发挥更大的作用？在座谈会上，清华大学党的负责同志提出了一些初步意见。他们引用了一位民主党派成员的话，这就是：“门户开放，权利平等，力竞公择，是存非去”。也就是另一位民主党派成员所说的“放心”和“放手”。在过去，学校的一些重大问题，都是征求过民主党派成员的意见的，但是，民主党派成员只参加“施工”，没有参加“设计”，只参加“演出”，没有参加“排练”。这是因为还没有彻底认识民主党派工作的重要性。过去曾经有的党员认为，和民主党派的关系已经没有问题了，民主党派的成员已都作了适当安排，却没有或很少考虑到，同民主党派在工作中应该采取甚么样的共事关系。今后采取一些甚么具体措施改变这种状况呢？这就是：一、加强党派联席会的作用。学校的重大问题，不是事先由党讨论，而是直接交由党派联席会讨论，让每个人都充分发表意见。各系也可以根据具体情况和需要，考虑成立系的党派联席会。学校的领导体制，今后也可以以党委领导制为基础，吸收各个方面共同参加为好。二、加强行政系统作用。学校的重大问题由校务委员会、各系的重大问题由系务委员会讨论，决定，并且贯彻执行。三、要求系秘书和做其他行政工作的党员，克服工作中简单化的作风。四、在各种工作中，向民主党派请求支援。
    民主党派如何发挥组织作用？
    要想把党、行政、民主党派的关系调整好，还必须解决民主党派基层组织在高等学校中的地位和任务的问题。党和非党的关系，是独立、平等的关系呢？还是领导和被领导的关系？在这个问题上，不少人都认为，民主党派除接受共产党的思想领导以外，在其他方面都是与共产党的基层组织平等的；它在学校的基本任务，同共产党的基层组织是一致的，这就是调动一切积极因素，办好学校。但是，这里就涉及到了这样一个问题：民主党派的组织如何发挥它的组织作用？
    有人认为必须首先加强民主党派成员的自我思想改造。思想改造得好，才能使自己的组织在理论上和思想水平上，同共产党处于平等的地位，发挥的作用才会更大。比如，有些人一直存在着一种自卑感，认为共产党员在政治上都比自己强，不相信自己会起什么作用；有些人怕监督错了受批评，不敢监督；有些人习惯于事事依赖共产党的帮助，缺乏独立思考和独立负责的精神，甚至在甚么地方挂一个锦旗的事情，都要向党委请示。显然，这些问题都是需要通过思想改造来求得解决。也有人认为，要加强组织作用，就必须加强领导的作用，希望民主党派的领导机构，能够根据学校中的中心问题，随时对自己的成员提出具体要求，还有人认为。要想民主党派的基层组织发挥作用，必须给党派的领导人以研究党务领导工作的时间。现在，民主党派基层组织的负责人，多半在教育行政、教学研究方面负着很大的责任，他们本来就很少有时间研究党务工作，而党务中的一些事务性的工作，又占去了他们仅有一点可能抽出来的时间。因此，希望学校方面帮助他们解决这些问题，或是考虑减轻担任党务工作的同志的其他工作任务。也有人认为，民主党派的成员，今后应该更多地参加各种行政组织和群众组织，以便在更多的方面发挥作用，体现与共产党“长期共存、互相监督”的权利和义务。
    推心置腹交朋友
    关于党员与非党同志之间的关系，有人提到，过去在清华大学，是不够正常的。党员不去或很少去非党同志家里，非党同志也不去或很少去党员家里。彼此都有顾虑。甚么顾虑呢？党员去非党同志家里，怕被怀疑是去检查他们的行动；而非党同志去党员家里，又怕被别人说是“拍马屁”。彼此之间，可以说只有政治联系没有感情联系。就是非党同志之间，也多是互不来往。过春节，从来不拜年。学校号召团拜，就有许多人不去，因为觉得平时少联系，过年来个大团拜，太形式了。有人谈到，有些党员作风太严肃，使人感到格格不入。
  “党员来谈话，是有事才来”。有的老教授，对曾经是他的学生的党员，无话不谈，而对一般党员，就不愿深谈。因此，不少人希望，党员与非党同志，要多接触；“酒逢知己千杯少，话不投机半句多”，“交情问题”是很重要的，朋友之间要推心置腹讲知心话，要有朋友的感情，这样才能真正做到亲密的合作共事。近来，这种情况已有改进。
    李维汉同志的一些意见
    李维汉部长在座谈会上，曾针对调查材料和大家谈话中所提出的一些问题作了发言。他谈到，共产党和各民主党派合作共事关系，是一个很普遍的关系。民主党派成员应该在工作中有职有权有责的问题，党在很早以前就提了出来。去年提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针以后，各民主党派都要求发挥更多的作用，清华大学这次调查中所提到的“从设计到施工、检查”的问题，就是这个愿望的表现。这是对的，应该肯定。
    我们有些党员同志，对民主党派的作用还没有正确的估计。民主党派一般都同我们有过很长时间的合作关系，他们走的道路是根据社会发展的规律向前发展的，在他们所代表的阶级、阶层中起了带头作用。
    民主党派，现在基本上是高级知识分子的政治集团。高级知识分子在我们国家是很重要的，他们对于后代是老师，在现在的各项建设中，是一支强有力的力量。他们应当同工人结合，工人也必须同他们结合。因此，应该重视民主党派，应该在政治上信任他们。在思想、学术上允许争、放，解除某些压力，克服党内的宗派主义，在这个基础上才能去掉党员与民主党派成员之间的鸿沟。
    为了贯彻这个政治路线，组织工作就应该服从它的要求。机关学校中党组与行政的关系以及保密制度、人事制度等方面，都有许多值得考虑的问题的。
    现在谈的清华的问题，只是同高级知识分子的关系一个方面的问题。校务委员会所作的决定，可以同党委的意见不一致。共产党可以在校务委员会上提出方案，民主党派也可以提出方案，个人也可以提出，总之要按多数人的意见办事，这样是不是会取消党的领导作用呢？我以为相反，更多地听取群众意见，领导作用就会更充实。
    单是在校务委员会作工作还是不够的，共产党还要作统战工作，通过各种接触，沟通各方面的关系，解决合作共事中的障碍。
    这些问题解决了，还要解决共产党员的态度问题。清华大学教职员中的共产党员有很多青年人，他们对老教授们，应该“拜老师，交朋友，开诚相见，虚心学习”。
    李维汉同志最后谈到，他的意见是提出供大家参考的，不是定论。他还建议清华大学领导上和各个方面共同研究出一些解决问题的办法，订出些制度，逐步解决现存的问题。
