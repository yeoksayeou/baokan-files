    The National Industrial and Commercial Circles Symposium, convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, held its eleventh session yesterday. Speakers at the session included Wang Genzhong, Central Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA); Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the CDNCA Central Committee; Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC); Huang Changshui, Vice Chairman of the ACFIC; Gong Tianmin, Vice Chairman of the ACFIC; Li Zuo'an, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Liu Yongye, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. Zi Yaohua, Member of the CDNCA Central Committee and Director of the Propaganda and Education Department, submitted written comments.

    Wang Genzhong spoke about the relationship between Party members and non-Party members, drawing on his experiences in the process of self-transformation. He first stated that he was a member of both the bourgeoisie and the landlord class, had served as a legislator for the Kuomintang, but had also participated in democratic movements, rescued revolutionary cadres, and was wanted by Chiang Kai-shek. After liberation he participated in the land reform. During this period, he had feelings of pride and also feelings of inferiority. After the land reform, he had a "rather left than right" mentality. These manifestations had a certain impact on the relationship between Party and non-Party members. Based on his own experience: when ideologically distancing himself from former bourgeois friends or Party member friends, walls appeared where there were none before; when his own ideology discarded these prejudices, the walls also came down. He believes that dismantling the wall means dismantling the class, which is to break capitalism and establish socialism. If it is said that the bourgeoisie can avoid transformation by handing over their enterprises, it is tantamount to bringing capitalism into socialist society, which is unacceptable.

    He believes that there are two aspects hindering the relationship between Party and non-Party members. On the one hand, some Party members have insufficient understanding of the new situation and discriminate against the industrial and commercial circles, exhibiting dogmatism and sectarianism; but on the other hand, some members of the industrial and commercial circles cling to their old ways and are unwilling to continue their transformation. Therefore, dismantling the wall must be done from both sides. On the one hand, Party members must be educated to overcome sectarianism, and on the other hand, the bourgeoisie must recognize their dual nature, take control of their own destiny, and strive to become self-reliant laborers.

    He proposed that a distinction should be made between sectarianism and sectarian activities. Sectarianism is a matter of uniting the masses and belongs to ideological style; while sectarian activities are a matter of forming small cliques within the organization and are not permitted by discipline. Secondly, opposing sectarianism should not be opposed to the core leadership of the Party. The core is not a sect, and it is unimaginable to build socialism without the leadership of the Communist Party as the core.

    Hu Juewen believes that the joint public-private management of enterprises is the best system, as long as the public and private sectors learn from each other. After a year or two, the public sector can become an expert organizer in the enterprise, and the private sector can also learn the management methods of socialist enterprises and change their style. He said that our internal cooperation is not the same as dealing with enemies, and mutual deception is not suitable for a cooperative relationship. He believes that the current public-private cooperation involves class relations, but this cooperative relationship should be directed at the matter, not at the person, let alone at the class. He said that anything that benefits the socialist cause is right, regardless of class. Running the enterprise well is the common desire of both the public and private sectors, so why can't they get along better? At present, the poor relationship between the public and private sectors is nothing more than a lack of mutual trust, arrogance, contempt for each other, and infringement of duties. In this situation, the public sector should bear more responsibility. He advocates mutual respect between the public and private sectors, starting with formality and further developing into openness. It is normal for couples to quarrel, and some quarrels make them better. If they "divorce" immediately after a quarrel and the public representative is no longer needed, it is not good either. Finally, he believes that the industrial and commercial circles should take this opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style, and see if they have the "three isms" during the "big blooming and contending." Every industrialist and businessman should seize the opportunity in the movement to train themselves and become a veritable asset to the country.

    Huang Changshui first raised some similar and different opinions on Bi Mingqi's speech this morning. He believes that it is inappropriate for Qian Jiaju to use a satirical poem in his speech as a type of bourgeois thought to criticize. He said: "Before joint ownership, a small kingdom; after joint ownership, a minister in a big country; after merger, a citizen of a lost country." I have not encountered this kind of thinking among the people I have contacted. He said that industrialists and businessmen themselves demanded joint ownership as a result of the Party's cultivation and education over the years and the improvement of their own awareness. After joint ownership, they received good political arrangements and more care economically than workers and peasants. How could they have the feeling of being "citizens of a lost country"?

    He disagreed with Bi Mingqi's assertion that "the public and private sectors should negotiate on an equal footing." He said: The cooperative relationship in enterprises is not a matter of equal negotiation, but a matter of leadership and being led. According to the spirit of the Constitution, the country is led by the working class, which is reflected in the enterprise as the public sector leading the private sector. Therefore, the current problems in enterprises are the issues of trust, support, authority and responsibility for the private sector.

    Gong Tianmin said: The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the national bourgeoisie is implemented through the United Front Work Department. In the past, the United Front Work Departments at the central and local levels have implemented the Party's united front policy in this work, played a significant role in the socialist transformation, and achieved certain successes, which is generally recognized. However, on the other hand, there are shortcomings. The main manifestation is that they pay more attention to the democratic parties and the upper-level figures in the industrial and commercial circles, and provide less specific help in terms of their work style and ideological transformation. They have not given appropriate criticism and help through specific matters. To be honest, the representative figures in the industrial and commercial circles at the central and local levels generally lag behind the masses. In applying the principle of "unity, criticism, unity," they can only talk about unity and cannot criticize among the upper-level figures. Sometimes when criticism is used, it cannot achieve new unity. And the united front work often uses the members of the democratic parties and industrialists and businessmen in joint ventures more and cares less. For example, there are early instructions from the State Council regarding medical expenses and sick pay for private sector personnel, but they have not been implemented below. Therefore, some people reflect that the United Front Work Department "unites those above" and "fights those below." In order to correctly implement the united front policy and strengthen the united front work, he suggested that the United Front Work Department should seriously examine and summarize the united front work.

    In his speech, Li Zuo'an reflected that there are some opinions at the local level regarding the united front work. They believe that the united front work is not thorough, that it unites those above but not those below, that it unites the big but not the small, and that the solicitation of opinions is limited to the upper levels; and because the upper levels have a large economic share and have many concerns, they do not understand the situation of the middle and lower levels, and the problems they reflect will not be comprehensive, and many problems that are reflected have no follow-up. The United Front Work Department sometimes manages the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association too tightly, with insufficient democracy; and sometimes it manages it too loosely, forming a situation of non-management. He reflected that there is still not enough "blooming" and "contending" in the industrial and commercial circles, mainly because they are worried that where there is "blooming" there must be "收" (tightening), and where there is "收" there must be "整" (rectification). In addition, they see that the leaders of the industrial and commercial circles only talk about the good things, or only talk about the old problems of the past, and have not reflected the true ideological situation, so the lower levels follow suit and dare not boldly "bloom" and "contend." They believe that if there is to be a big blooming and contending, the leaders of the industrial and commercial circles must truly play a leading role.

    Liu Yongye also reflected that the industrial and commercial circles are still worried about the rectification campaign and are afraid of retaliation. He believes that the transformation of the industrial and commercial circles should be based on the method of treating the illness to save the patient and prescribing the right medicine, but this is not done well. He said that we are here to help the Communist Party rectify its work style, but now it feels as if we are helping the industrial and commercial circles rectify their work style, such as the criticism of "fixed interest for twenty years" and "withdrawal of public representatives."

    In his written statement, Zi Yaohua first affirmed that the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie and the class relations in the public-private cooperation relationship are objective problems; that there is no need for a twenty-year fixed interest; and that in joint public-private enterprises, the public sector needs to lead politically and economically. If the public representative's style is not upright, the attitude is bad, the enterprise and the public-private cooperation relationship cannot be done well, or even production is hindered, the competent department can be asked to replace them.

    Then, based on his recent inspections in various places and what he has seen and heard, he talked about the united front policy towards capitalist industrialists and businessmen, the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, and how to break capitalism and establish socialism, how to break it and how to establish it.

    Regarding the united front policy towards capitalist industrialists and businessmen, he said that the Party Central Committee attaches importance to it, but the small and basic levels do not attach importance to it, and the enterprise departments and other departments do not attach importance to it even more. Some places even do not know what the meaning of the united front policy is. As a result, some rather serious deviations have occurred in some joint public-private enterprises. For example, some public representatives, because they do not understand the united front policy, not only fail to handle the public-private relationship well, but even intentionally create contradictions between the private sectors. After the joint venture of the entire industry, in many enterprises in the private sector, the public sector praises those who are superficially obedient and accommodating, and suppresses those who are serious, honest, and like to make suggestions. He hopes that the Central United Front Work Department will implement the policy to the grass-roots level and to various enterprises, and conduct inspections at any time.

    Regarding the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, he said that some Party members represent the Party with their personal will, not only replacing the government with the Party, but also replacing the government with individuals, wanting the Party's signboard, using the Party's prestige, and distorting the Party's policies to suppress non-Party members. How can we talk about mutual supervision? He hopes that the Party will do more publicity and education work in this regard, so that Party members can correctly implement the Party's policies.

    Regarding the issue of breaking capitalism and establishing socialism. He said that capitalism must be broken, and it must be broken thoroughly, and socialism must be established, and it must be established solidly. But what to break? How to break it? This is a question that industrialists and businessmen in various places hope to have something to follow. Because sometimes when talking about breaking capitalism, it is almost always a complete negation, thinking that everything in the past of capitalist industrialists and businessmen is undesirable. Too much negation will lead to looking down on the capitalists, and thus the industrialists and businessmen themselves will feel that they are useless and inferior, lose their self-confidence, which will hinder transformation and progress and prevent them from exerting their initiative and potential. He believes that the capitalist private ownership system, the bourgeois position, viewpoints, thoughts, and style should all be completely eradicated. However, some very good business management methods and technical expertise could serve capitalism in the past, can serve socialism now, and can serve communism in the future. The Party Central Committee and the government have long said that capitalist industrialists and businessmen are not a burden on the country, but a wealth of the country. What does this wealth refer to? Of course, it does not refer to the meager 2 billion yuan worth of means of production, but rather to the management and technology expertise of hundreds of thousands of industrialists and businessmen in the past in enterprises, factories, management, technology, experience, and other knowledge. This knowledge has been gained by them over decades of survival and competition in the capitalist economy, in resisting the oppression of bureaucratic capitalism, and in the struggle against imperialist economic aggression. In the past, a factory or an enterprise was able to survive and develop from small to large in the stormy waves, which was neither accidental nor simple. Because in the past, private capital had to go bankrupt if it neglected business management, and would be eliminated if it did not seek improvement in technical knowledge, and would be deserted if it did not improve its service methods to facilitate residents day by day. If these positive factors are all wiped out without critical affirmation, then hundreds of thousands of large and small industrialists and businessmen are not the wealth of the country, but truly a burden on the country. Therefore, it is hoped that all parties responsible for uniting, educating, and transforming capitalists will break what should be broken when it comes to "breaking capitalism," and not break what does not need to be broken, let alone what should not be broken. Do not negate everything or destroy everything, so that we can mobilize all possible forces and give play to all possible positive factors.

### 全国工商界座谈会继续举行  讨论公私关系和批评统战工作的缺点

    全国工商界座谈会继续举行
    讨论公私关系和批评统战工作的缺点
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会，昨天举行第十一次座谈。在会上发言的有民主建国会中央委员王艮仲、民主建国会中央副主任委员胡厥文、全国工商联副主任委员毕鸣岐、全国工商联副主任委员黄长水、全国工商联副主任委员巩天民、云南省工商联主任委员李琢庵、福建省工商联副主任委员刘永业。民建中央委员兼宣教处长资耀华发表书面意见。
    王艮仲从自己改造过程中的一些体会谈到关于党与非党人士的关系问题。他首先申明自己是资产阶级兼地主阶级分子，当过国民党的立法委员，同时也参加过民主运动，营救过革命干部，遭到蒋介石的通缉，解放后参加过土地改革。在这段过程中，曾经产生过骄傲情绪，也出现过自卑感，在土改以后，有宁左勿右的思想。这些表现，在党和非党的关系上受到了一定的影响。根据他自己的经验：当思想上远离资产阶级故旧朋友或党员朋友的时候，原来没有墙的也有了墙，当自己的思想上丢掉了这些成见时，墙也就拆掉了。他认为拆墙就是拆阶级，就是要破资本主义，立社会主义，如果说资产阶级交出了企业就可以不要改造了，这就是等于把资本主义带到社会主义社会去，这是不可以的。
    他认为障碍着党与非党关系的有两个方面，一方面有些党员对新形势认识不足，对工商界歧视，有教条主义和宗派主义；但工商界有些人抱着原来的东西不放，不愿意继续改造。因此，拆墙要从两方面拆，一方面要教育党员克服宗派主义，另一方面资产阶级要承认两面性，掌握自己的命运，努力成为自食其力的劳动者。
    他提出对宗派主义和宗派活动需要加以区分，宗派主义是团结群众问题，是属于思想作风问题；而宗派活动，则属于组织上闹小圈子的问题，是纪律不容许的。其次反对宗派主义不能同党的核心领导对立起来，核心不是宗派，没有以共产党为核心的领导，要建设社会主义是不可想像的。
    胡厥文认为公私合营企业的公私共事是一个最好的制度，只要公私双方互相学习，一两年后，公方就可以成为企业中内行的组织者，私方也可以学会社会主义企业的管理方法，改变自己的作风。他说，我们人民内部的合作共事，不等于对待敌人，尔诈我虞是不适于共事关系的。他认为目前公私共事是有阶级关系的，但这种共事关系应该对事，不应当对人，更不应当对阶级。他说凡是做对社会主义事业有利的事，不管他是什么阶级都是对的。把企业办好，是公私双方的共同愿望，为什么不能相处得更好呢？目前，公私双方关系搞不好，不外乎是相互间信任不够，自高自大，鄙视对方，侵犯职责。这种情况，公方要多负些责任。他主张公私双方要互相尊重，开始相敬如宾，进一步发展到开诚相见。夫妻之间吵架原是平常的事，有的越吵越好，如果一吵架就马上“离婚”，公方代表就不要了，这也不好。最后他认为工商界这次帮助党整风，在大放大鸣中间，也要看看自己有没有三个主义？程度怎样？每个工商业者都要在运动中抓紧机会，锻炼自己，使自己成为国家名副其实的财富。
    黄长水首先对今天上午毕鸣岐的发言提了一些相同的意见和不同的意见。他认为千家驹在发言中引用一首打油诗作为资产阶级思想类型来批判是不适当的。他说：“合营前小国之君，合营后大国之臣，合并后亡国之民”这些话，在我接触的人当中还没有这种思想。他说，工商业者自己要求合营，是受到党几年来的培养教育，和本身觉悟提高的结果。合营以后，政治上得到很好的安排，经济上也得到比工人农民更多的照顾，又如何会产生“亡国之民”的感慨呢？
    他不同意毕鸣岐提出“公私双方应该平等协商”的说法，他说：企业中共事关系，不是平等协商的问题，而是领导与被领导的问题。根据宪法精神，国家是以工人阶级为领导，反映在企业中就是公方领导私方。因此目前在企业中存在的问题，是对私方的信任支持和有职有权问题。
    巩天民说：党的团结教育改造民族资产阶级分子政策，是通过统战部贯彻的。过去中央和地方各级统战部门，在这项工作中是贯彻了党的统战政策，对社会主义改造工作，起了很大作用，获得了一定成就，这是大家公认的。但另一方面是存在着缺点的。主要表现在对各民主党派和工商界上层人物照顾的多，而对他们的工作作风、思想改造方面具体帮助少。没有通过具体事物，适当的给予批评和帮助。老实说目前中央和地方工商界的代表人物普遍存在着领导落后于群众的现象。在运用团结、批评、团结的方针上，在上层人物中，只能讲团结，不能批评，有时运用了批评，又不能达到新的团结。而统战工作对合营企业中的民主党派成员和工商业者往往使用多、关心少，例如私方人员的医疗费用、病假工资，国务院早有指示，但下边到现在多未贯彻实行。因此有人反映：统战部是“统上”、“战下”。为了正确贯彻统战政策，加强统战工作，他建议统战部应认真检查总结一下统战工作。
    李琢庵发言中反映地方上对于统战工作有一些意见，认为统战工作不深入，统上不统下，统大不统小，征求意见只限于上层；而上层由于经济比重大，顾虑多，对于中下层的情况不了解，反映的问题也就不会全面，很多问题反映上去也没有下文。统战部对工商联、民建会的工作，有时管得太紧，民主不够；有时又管得太松，形成不管。他反映目前在工商界还“鸣”“放”得不够，主要顾虑是认为有放必有收，有收必有整，另外看到工商界的领导人物只讲好的，或只谈过去的老问题，还没有把真实思想情况反映出来，因此下面也就马首是瞻，不敢大胆“鸣”“放”。他们认为要大鸣大放，还得工商界的领导人物真正起带头作用。
    刘永业也反映工商界对整风还有顾虑，怕报复。他认为对工商界的改造，应该本着治病救人的办法，对症下药，但这方面做的不好。他说，我们是来帮助共产党整风的，但现在感到好像是反过来帮助工商界整风了，例如对“定息二十年”、“撤出公方代表”等等的批判。
    资耀华在书面发言中，首先肯定民族资产阶级的两面性和公私共事关系中的阶级关系，是客观存在的问题；二十年定息也没有必要；在公私合营企业中，在政治上需要有公方的领导，在经济上也需要是公方的领导。如果公方代表作风不正派，态度恶劣，不能搞好企业和公私共事关系，甚至妨碍开展生产时，可以请主管部门调换。
    接着，他就最近在各地视察及原来所见所闻，谈关于对资本主义工商业者的统战政策、关于党与非党的关系和关于破资本主义立社会主义，如何破如何立的问题。
    关于对资本主义工商业者的统战政策，他说党中央重视，中小基层不重视，企业机关等部门更不重视。甚至有些地方根本不知道统战政策是什么意义。因而在有些公私合营企业中，发生了好些相当严重的偏差。例如有些公方代表因为不懂统战政策，不但公私关系搞不好，甚至有意造成私私之间的矛盾，在全行业合营后在私方很多的企业中，公方抬举那些表面唯唯诺诺，遇事逢迎一方，压制那些认真老实，爱提意见的一方。他希望中央统战部要将政策贯彻到基层和各企业中去，并随时进行检查。
    关于党与非党的关系问题，他说，有些党员以个人的意志代表党，不但以党代政，且以个人代政，要党的招牌，假党的威信，曲解党的政策，来压制非党人士。这怎能谈得上互相监督呢？他希望党在这方面多做些宣传教育工作，使党员正确地贯彻党的政策。
    关于破资本主义立社会主义的问题。他说资本主义要破，要破得彻底，社会主义要立，要立得巩固。但破什么？如何破？这是各地工商业者希望有所适从的一个问题。因为有时一谈到破资本主义，差不多总是全盘否定，认为资本主义工商业者过去一切的一切，都是要不得的东西。否定得太多了，就会看不起资方，因而使工商业者自己也感觉到一无是处，低人一等，失去了自信心，这就妨碍了改造和进步，不能发挥积极性和潜在力。他认为资本主义私人所有制，资产阶级的立场、观点、思想和作风，都应当彻底铲除。但有一些很好的经营管理方法和经验技术，过去可以为资本主义服务，现在也可以为社会主义服务，将来还可以为共产主义服务。党中央和政府早已说过，资本主义工商业者不是国家的包袱，而是国家的财富。这个财富是指什么呢？当然不是指那小得可怜的二十几亿的生产资料，而是指的经营、几十万工商业者过去对企业、工厂管理、技术、经验等等知识。这些知识，是他们几十年来在资本主义经济生存竞争中得来的，是在抵抗官僚资本主义的压迫中获得的，是在反对帝国主义经济侵略斗争中所积累下来的。过去一个工厂，一个企业，其所以能在惊涛骇浪中，由小到大，生存发展，既不是偶然的，也不是简单的。因为私人资本过去对于经营管理，稍一疏忽，就要倾家破产；对于技术知识，不求改进，就要被淘汰；对于服务方式，不日新月异地便利居民，就要门可罗雀。这些积极因素，若一概抹杀，而不加以批判地来肯定，则几十万大小工商业者就不是国家的财富，而真是国家的包袱了。所以希望负团结教育改造资本家职责的各方面，对于“破资本主义”，要破其所当破，不要破其所不必破，更不要破其所不当破，既不要全盘否定，更不要玉石俱焚，才可以动员一切可能动员的力量，才可以发挥一切可能发挥的积极因素。
