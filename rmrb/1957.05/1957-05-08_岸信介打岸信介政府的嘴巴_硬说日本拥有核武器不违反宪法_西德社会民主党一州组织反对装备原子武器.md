Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated in the Diet today, "It does not violate the constitution if (Japan) possesses atomic weapons for the purpose of self-defense."

Answering questions from Socialist Party members in the House of Councillors Cabinet Committee meeting, Nobusuke Kishi also said, "For self-defense, (Japan) must possess the power to effectively conduct modern warfare." However, he also said that he had no intention of arming the Japanese military with nuclear weapons.

Kyodo News pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's response marked a clear change from the Japanese government's past attitude toward the issue of Japan possessing nuclear weapons. In the past, the Japanese government's unified view was: "Currently, nuclear weapons are offensive weapons, so possessing nuclear weapons violates the constitution." Japanese Defense Agency Director-General Akira Kotaki stated on April 25 in the same committee of the House of Councillors: "Under the current circumstances, (Japan) possessing nuclear weapons violates the constitution."

The Socialist Party attaches great importance to Nobusuke Kishi's statement and has decided to further investigate and fiercely criticize it in the future.

According to a comprehensive report in this newspaper, Xinhua News Agency reports: The Schleswig-Holstein State Congress of the Social Democratic Party in West Germany, held in Flensburg on the 5th, unanimously passed a resolution opposing the equipping of the West German army with atomic weapons.

After the congress concluded, Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said at a press conference, "If I become the head of government, I will not only prevent the Federal Republic of (West Germany) from being equipped with atomic weapons, but also prevent the storage of American atomic weapons within the Federal Republic." At the same time, Ollenhauer also stated that his party still agrees with the "military obligations" that West Germany has undertaken to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Eckardt, the press officer of the West German Chancellor, told reporters on the 6th that Adenauer "could not" "abandon atomic weapons" according to the Soviet Union's suggestion.

Eckardt also said that even if the German Democratic Republic does not equip its army with atomic weapons, West Germany would not consider this a "bargaining chip" for West Germany to abandon atomic weapons.

Eckardt announced that Adenauer is prepared to reply later this month to the Soviet Union's letter warning of the danger of West German atomic armament, and the Soviet Union's conditions for restoring German unification put forward last October. West Germany and the Soviet Union will hold trade negotiations later this month.

Speaking of Britain's new defense policy, Eckardt accused Britain of making the decision to withdraw its army from Europe without consulting with its NATO allies in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: TASS reports: 60,000 British miners held their annual miners' festival on May 6 in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh.

Attendees passed a resolution calling for a halt to hydrogen bomb testing and a ban on nuclear weapons. The resolution also called for parliamentary elections and called for the election of a Labour government.

    岸信介打岸信介政府的嘴巴
    硬说日本拥有核武器不违反宪法
    西德社会民主党一州组织反对装备原子武器
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在国会里说：“如果在自卫的范围内（日本）拥有原子武器是不违反宪法的。”
    岸信介在参议院内阁委员会会议上答复社会党议员的质询时还说：“为了自卫，（日本）必须拥有有效地进行现代战争的力量。”不过他又说，他毫无意思要用核武器武装日本军队。
    共同社指出，岸信介的答复同过去日本政府对于日本拥有核武器问题的态度有了明显的改变。过去日本政府的统一的见解是：“目前，核武器是带有攻击性质的武器，所以拥有核武器是违反宪法的”。日本防卫厅长官小泷彬4月25日曾经在参议院的同一个委员会上说：“按照目前情况（日本）拥有核武器是违反宪法的”。
    社会党很重视岸信介的这个发言，并且决定今后要进一步追究和猛烈抨击岸信介的这个发言。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在西德弗伦斯堡举行的社会民主党石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州代表大会5日一致通过决议，反对西德军队装备原子武器。
    社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在大会结束以后在记者招待会上说，“如果我成为政府首脑，我不仅要阻止（西德）联邦共和国进行原子武器装备，而且要阻止在联邦共和国境内储存美国原子武器”。同时，奥伦豪尔又表示它的党仍然赞同西德对北大西洋公约组织所承担的“军事义务”。
    西德总理的新闻发布官埃卡特6日对记者说，阿登纳“不可能”按照苏联的建议“放弃原子武器”。
    埃卡特还说，如果德意志民主共和国不用原子武器装备它的军队，西德也不认为这是使西德放弃原子武器的一个“交换条件”。
    埃卡特宣布，阿登纳准备在本月下旬答复苏联关于警告西德进行原子军备的危险的函件和去年10月苏联对恢复德国统一问题所提条件的函件。西德和苏联将在本月下旬举行贸易谈判。
    在谈到英国的新国防政策时，埃卡特指责英国事先不和北大西洋的盟国协商就做出从欧洲撤出陆军的决定。
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国六万矿工5月6日在爱丁堡霍利鲁德公园举行每年一次的矿工节。
    到会者通过一项决议，号召停止试验氢弹和禁止核武器。决议还要求进行议会选举，并号召选举工党政府。
