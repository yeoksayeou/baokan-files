Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd dispatch from Paris: The French National Assembly, on the evening of May 21st, rejected a vote of confidence in the Mollet government by 250 votes to 213. This has forced the government to resign after fifteen months and twenty days in power.

According to the French constitution, a vote of no confidence in the government by the National Assembly must exceed more than half of the total 595 seats in the National Assembly for the government to be required to resign. However, it is reported that Mollet has firmly stated that his government will resign.

Mollet immediately met with President Coty after the parliamentary vote to submit the government's resignation. Coty said that he would consult with the leaders of various political parties before announcing whether he would accept the Mollet government's request to resign.

Mollet was defeated on the issue of the government's request to increase new taxes and reduce budget expenditures. He anticipated that the government's proposals would be criticized by members of parliament from all sides, so he gambled with the life of the government and demanded that parliament hold a vote of confidence. In this, the thirty-fourth vote of confidence he has requested since taking office, leftists and right-wingers alike voted against.

Those who voted against included 150 communists and their supporters, the majority of 102 conservatives, and 37 Brachard supporters. Those who voted in favor of the government included 100 socialists, social republicans (former Gaullists), and centrist groups such as the Christian Democrats. Many members of Mendes-France's Radical Socialist Party abstained.

Agence France-Presse's report emphasized the fact that the majority of members of the "Independent Party," which holds 100 seats in parliament, voted against. The report said that this party had saved the Mollet government in the last vote of confidence by abstaining.

Another noteworthy point is that, although the debate was about the financial plan, many members of parliament made many criticisms of the government's Algerian policy and its "useless and untimely" appeal to the United Nations Security Council on the Suez issue.

At the morning session on May 21st, André Maurice, a Radical Party member who supported the government, and Guy Mollet, a Socialist Party member, asked for support for the government and threatened members with the serious consequences that could arise from a crisis.

Communist Party member Waldeck Rochet emphasized at the afternoon meeting that the imposition of new taxes would worsen the situation of the working people, and that the government's austerity budget expenditures were related to civilian rather than military expenditures.

Rochet said that we are voting to express our no confidence in the government, and we believe that we reflect the feelings of the working people who condemn the government's reactionary policies and demand the restoration of peace in Algeria.

Among the speculations about Mollet's possible successors, the names mentioned include former Prime Minister and Independent Party member Antoine Pinay, former Minister and Popular Republican Party member Pierre Pflimlin, and Mollet government's Minister of Education and Radical Party member René Billères. In addition, François Mitterrand, Minister of Justice in the Mollet government, who is close to the Radical Socialist Party, and former Prime Minister René Pleven, were also mentioned.

### 内外政策失尽人心  法国摩勒政府辞职

    内外政策失尽人心
    法国摩勒政府辞职
    据新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会21日晚间以二百五十票对二百一十三票拒绝对摩勒政府表示信任，这就使得这个政府在执政十五个月零二十天以后不得不提出辞职。
    按照法国宪法规定，国民议会对政府的不信任投票必须要达到超过国民议会总数五百九十五个议席的半数以上，这个政府才必须辞职。但是，有消息说，摩勒坚决表示他的政府要辞职。
    摩勒在议会表决之后立刻谒见总统戈蒂提出政府的辞呈。戈蒂说他将同各政党领袖进行磋商，然后再宣布他是否接受摩勒政府的辞职要求。
    摩勒是在政府要求增收新税和削减预算开支的问题上被击败的。他预计政府的提案将受到议员们多方责难，于是用政府生命作赌注，要求议会举行信任投票。就在这一次从他执政以来要求的第三十四次信任投票中，左派人士和右翼分子一起投了反对票。
    投反对票的有一百五十名共产党人和支持他们的人、一百零二名保守分子中的大多数和三十七名布热德分子。投票支持政府的有一百名社会党人、社会共和党人（前戴高乐分子）和像天主教民主党这样的中间集团。弃权的有孟戴斯—弗朗斯的激进社会党的许多议员。
    法新社的报道着重指出了在议会中拥有一百个席位的“独立党”的多数议员投反对票这件事。消息说，这个党在上次信任投票中曾经因弃权而挽救了摩勒政府。
    值得注意的另一件事是：虽然辩论的是财政计划，但是好多议员对政府的阿尔及利亚政策和它目前就苏伊士问题向联合国安理会提出的“无用的、不合时宜的”申诉进行了许多批评。
    在21日上午会议上，支持政府的激进党议员安德烈·摩里斯和社会党议员纪恩要求支持政府，并且用可能产生危机的严重后果来威胁议员们。
    共产党议员瓦德克·罗歇在下午的会议上强调指出，规定新税会使劳动人民状况恶化，而政府紧缩的预算开支都是有关民用的而不是军事开支。
    罗歇说，我们投票表示不信任政府，我们相信，我们反映着谴责政府反动政策和要求恢复阿尔及利亚和平的劳动人民的感情。
    在摩勒的可能继任人的猜测中，有人提出了前总理、独立党人安托万·比内、前部长、人民共和党人比埃尔·弗林姆兰和摩勒政府的教育部长、激进党人雷纳·毕埃尔。此外，还提出了接近激进社会党人的摩勒政府的司法部长弗朗索瓦·密特朗和前总理雷纳·普利文。
