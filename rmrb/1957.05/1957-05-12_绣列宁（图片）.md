    Embroidering Lenin
    "Lenin in Exile"
    This period in the life of the revolutionary teacher,
    Has been written into poems by countless poets,
    And painted into pictures by countless painters.
    The embroidery girls of Suzhou,
    Also thought day and night, with thousands upon thousands of stitches,
    Using yarn to embroider their own paintings and poems.
    Look, how happy Lu Qiaoyun is,
    She seems to be saying:
    "Dear Comrade Lenin,
    Please sit for a little longer,
    Only a few more stitches and it will be finished."	  Wu Mingwen, Xinhua News Agency reporter, Photo by Xu Bihua

    绣列宁
    “列宁在流放中”
    革命导师的这段生活，
    曾有多少诗人写成诗篇，
    有多少画家画成画。
    苏州的刺绣姑娘们，
    也日思夜想，千针万针，
    用绒线绣成了自己的画和诗。
    看，陆巧云多么快乐，
    她仿佛在说：
    “亲爱的列宁同志，
    请你再坐一会儿，
    还有不多几针就绣好了。”	  吴鸣文　新华社记者　许必华摄
