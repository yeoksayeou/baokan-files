	Tokyo Residents Line Up to Sell Blood
	According to the Philippine "Manila Chronicle," no fewer than two thousand people in Tokyo, Japan, make a living by selling their blood. According to the current market in Tokyo, a pint of fresh blood can only be sold for five yen. At the blood transfusion stations in Tokyo, in front of the blood banks, there are queues of men and women in rags, with hungry faces (including mothers holding babies), waiting to have their blood drawn every day.
		
	Please Send the Honorable Members to the Front Line
	The Mayor of Kansas City, USA, recently said: If war breaks out again, he advocates sending members of the US Congress to the front line. This mayor once advocated sending people over the age of fifty-five to fight, because this would ensure that the war would not last more than two weeks.

    东京人民排队卖血
    据菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”报道，在日本东京靠出卖自己的血液为生的人，不下两千名之多。照目前东京的行情，每品脱鲜血只能卖到五日元。在东京的输血站，血库前面，每天都有衣衫褴褛，面有饥色的男女（其中也有怀抱婴儿的母亲）在那里排队，等候抽血。
      请议员先生上火线
    美国堪萨斯市市长最近说：如果战争再度爆发，他主张派遣美国国会议员上火线。这位市长曾经主张让五十五岁以上的人去打仗，因为这样使战争的时间不致于超过两个星期。
