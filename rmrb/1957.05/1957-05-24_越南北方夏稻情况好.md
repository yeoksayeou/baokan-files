The summer rice crop in northern Vietnam is growing well this year. In the Vinh Linh area, near the 17th parallel, 8,800 mu of early rice has ripened and harvesting has begun. Further north, in the Red River Delta's Third Interzone, two-thirds of the rice has headed. In many places, the early rice is growing even better than last year. People in Ha Nam, Ninh Binh, Ha Dong, and Nam Dinh provinces are actively preparing for the harvest. Responsible parties estimate that many areas will enter the main harvest stage by the end of May.

    越南北方夏稻情况好
    本报讯　越南北方今年夏稻生长情况良好。十七度线附近的永灵区的八千八百亩早稻已经成熟并且开始收割了。再往北，红河三角洲的第三联区已经有三分之二的稻子出穗了。有许多地方的早稻比去年长得还要好。河南、宁平、河东、南定等省人民正积极为收割工作进行准备。据负责方面估计，许多地区到5月底，就要进入大收割阶段。
