    柯庆施, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, requested at an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee today that Party member bureau chiefs and ministers actively and proactively participate in the rectification movement.
    While the broad masses of cadres in Shanghai are studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, beginning on April 18, successively convened fourteen symposiums with intellectuals. The Municipal Party Secretaries personally listened to the opinions of scientists, professors, engineers, writers, actors, doctors, and journalists regarding the handling of contradictions among the people. This kind of cordial exchange greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the intellectual community, who bravely exposed the shortcomings and problems existing in their work, and also put forward many beneficial suggestions.
    Today, 柯庆施 reported the opinions put forward by the intellectual community at these symposiums to the Party member bureau chiefs and ministers. He pointed out that although the general cadre's understanding of the new situation and new tasks has improved, it is still necessary to further educate them. In particular, the point that we ourselves need to transform ourselves even more in socialist construction must be repeatedly explained to the cadres, so that every cadre has a full understanding. At present, the old ways of working are still very serious in various tasks. Many cadres look upwards to the intentions of the leaders, use administrative orders downwards, and do not use their brains. The relationship between the Party and the masses is generally not harmonious enough. Many Party members think they are superior to others and lack consultation with the masses when doing things.
    柯庆施 said that learning a new set of working methods must have a process, but checking and overcoming the serious bureaucratic style of work, putting down the airs of officials, and leading cadres going deep into the students and workers are all immediately feasible. He urged everyone to mobilize urgently, consciously and voluntarily carry out rectification, and not to wait.
    魏文伯 and 许建国, Secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, have also gone deep into factories and schools to help resolve the current acute contradictions.

### 在社会主义建设中更加需要改造自己  领导干部应主动投入整风

    在社会主义建设中更加需要改造自己
    领导干部应主动投入整风
    据新华社上海4日电　中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施今天在市委常委扩大会议上，要求党员局长和部长们，主动地积极地投入整风运动。
    在上海广大干部学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话同时，中共上海市委员会从4月18日开始，连续召开了十四个知识界座谈会，市委书记们亲自倾听了科学家、教授、工程师、作家、演员、医师和记者编辑对处理人民内部矛盾问题的意见。这种亲切的交谈大大地鼓舞了知识界的积极性，他们勇敢地揭发了工作中存在的缺点和问题，也提出不少有益的建议。
    今天柯庆施把知识界在这些座谈会上提出的意见，向党员局长和部长们作了报告。他指出，目前一般干部对新形势、新任务的认识虽有提高，但还必须进一步进行教育。尤其对于在社会主义建设中我们自己更加需要改造这一点，需要向干部们反复说明，要使每一个干部都有充分的认识。目前各项工作中老一套的工作方法还很严重，不少干部对上看领导意图，对下用行政命令，不动脑筋。党和群众的关系一般也不够融洽。不少党员自以为高人一头，做事缺乏和群众商量。
    柯庆施说，要学会一套新的工作方法必须有一个过程，但是检查与克服工作中的严重的官僚主义作风，放下官架子，领导干部深入到学生、工人群众中去，这些都是立即可行的。他要求大家紧急动员起来，主动自觉地进行整风，不要等待。
    市委书记处书记魏文伯、许建国也已经深入工厂、学校去帮助解决当前尖锐的矛盾问题。
