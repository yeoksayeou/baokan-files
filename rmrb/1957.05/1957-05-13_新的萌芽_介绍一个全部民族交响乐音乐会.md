    New Sprouts
    ——Introducing an All-National Symphony Orchestra Concert	Li Ling
    It's been quite a while since I last watched the symphony orchestra rehearse. I know they are enthusiastically arranging a new and wonderful performance for the people; this is also a concert of entirely Chinese symphonic works, presented on a ticketed basis, unprecedented in Beijing.
    In my youth, I often fantasized: how wonderful it would be if one day we could have a symphony orchestra? And how wonderful it would be if we could present our own symphonic works to the people and international friends!
    This aspiration has always occupied the minds of many, constantly giving them a source of encouragement.
    The road is so rugged and difficult. The Shanghai Municipal Council (later changed to the Municipal Government) orchestra before liberation was initially composed of foreigners; around 1940, Ma Sicong and others, with the support of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, established the "China Symphony Orchestra" (later transferred to the puppet Ministry of Education). These groups also sowed some seeds on barren soil and began their own national symphony composition. However, how arduous it was! How painful were those friends who worked under pressure and poverty! A young man playing the violin in the orchestra once posted a few lines of poetry on the wall to describe the mood at the time: "Here, even the stones will weep..."
    Only after liberation could we freely, grandly, and bravely think about this issue.
    So one or two, three or five... as many as sixteen or seventeen. People heard selections from world-famous operas and symphonies, and also some of our own musical pieces. Now, it is about to appear in the form of introducing an all-national symphony concert.
    I don't want to comment on the merits and demerits of these new works; I just want to report such a good news to everyone. There are more than ten works in total. The authors of these works are all meeting us for the first time; they are so young, so numerous, and so sincerely cultivating, planting, developing, and growing in the garden of national art. This alone will make people rejoice!
    I once described the world of symphony as an ocean of music. Perhaps our new ocean is not wide or deep enough yet, but every listener who cares about these new seedlings is also a great driving force in urging and encouraging this nascent undertaking forward.

    新的萌芽
    ——介绍一个全部民族交响乐音乐会	李凌
    好些日子我没有去看交响乐队排练了。我知道，他们正兴致勃勃地为人们安排一次新的、美好的演出；这也是北京前所未有的、采取卖座形式演出全部中国交响乐作品的音乐会。
    年轻时候，常常幻想：如果有一天我们能有一个交响乐队多好？如果能有自己的交响乐作品呈献于人民和国际朋友面前又是多好呢！
    这种愿望，一直占据了好些人的心头；常常给人一种鼓舞力量。
    路是如此崎岖，艰难。解放前的上海工部局（后改为市政府）乐队最初是外国人的；马思聪等人于1940年左右在中苏友协的赞助下成立了“中华交响乐团”（后改隶伪教育部），这些团体也曾在荒芜的土壤上播下了一些种子，开始了自己民族的交响曲创作。然而，那是多么艰辛呢！那些辗转于高压和贫困之下工作的朋友，是多么痛苦！一个在乐队拉小提琴的青年，曾在墙上贴了几句诗句来描写当时的心境：“在这里，就连石头也会哭泣的。……”
    只是解放以后，我们才能自由地，壮阔地，勇敢地来思考这个问题。
    于是一个两个，三个五个……多到十六、七个。人们听到了世界著名的歌剧选曲、交响乐曲，也听到了一些我们自己的乐曲。而今，要开始以介绍全部民族交响乐的形式出现了。
    我不想评述这些新作品的得失，我只想向大家报道这样的一个喜讯，它一共有十多个作品。这些作品的作者都是第一次和我们见面；他们是如此年轻，如此众多，如此真诚地在民族艺术的园圃里垦植播种、发育、滋长，仅仅这一点就会使人欢笑了！
    我曾描写过那交响乐的天地是音乐的海洋，也许我们这个新的海洋还不够宽阔、深远，然而每一个关心这些新苗的听众，也常是督促和鼓励这萌芽的事业向前的极大动力。
