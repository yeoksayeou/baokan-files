Protecting Historical Buildings
		Pan Xiezhi

During my four months in Poland and Czechoslovakia, I visited many cities, and the most profound impression was the care these two countries took in protecting ancient buildings. The Old Town and New Town of Warsaw were restored to their original appearance from a pile of rubble after the war. The old city of Gdańsk in northern Poland, a street that could be described as magnificent, was also rebuilt from ruins. Many monumental buildings severely damaged during the war, such as the statues of Mickiewicz and Copernicus, were carefully repaired by artists to restore their original appearance. In Czechoslovakia, more than thirty cities are listed as cultural heritage conservation units, and these cities completely preserve the medieval style; new construction can only be carried out in designated areas, and any changes to a single tree or stone in the old city must be approved by the cultural heritage preservation authorities. In Prague, despite many people clamoring that traffic conditions were bad, the narrow medieval streets and alleys throughout the city were carefully preserved, and even the streetlights still used gas. The same is true of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. As for the tens of thousands of ancient palaces, churches, etc. throughout the country, they have been renovated; even commemorative buildings that had disappeared before the war, such as the Vyšehrad Monski Church in Prague (where Jan Hus spread revolutionary ideas in the fifteenth century), have been restored based on documents and underground archaeological materials.

It is very touching that the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia are vigorously protecting and restoring various ancient buildings, and even entire cities, in their socialist construction. This should not be interpreted as conservatism or restorationism, but as a manifestation of a high degree of patriotism in respecting their own national history. These ancient buildings evoke people's historical feelings, remind people of the arduous struggles of past eras and foreign invaders, and allow them to understand the lifestyles of their ancestors and their achievements in various cultural and artistic fields.

Moreover, while preserving ancient buildings, the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia have also excellently resolved the contradiction between them and the incompatibility with the lives of today's people. For example, opening up indoor corridors to solve traffic problems; modifying the interior so that residents of the old city can still enjoy full modern amenities, etc.; in short, it demonstrates the consistency of respecting historical heritage and caring for people's lives, without taking brutal measures against either side.

From this, I am saddened by the scene of our city builders demolishing ancient buildings one by one in a bold and sweeping manner. In fact, many of them could have been avoided, such as going underground, detouring on both sides, etc., and some solutions could always be found. The Dong'anmen, Xi'anmen, Di'anmen, and Sanzuomen gates of Beijing have all disappeared, and not a single archway has been left on the streets. As for those old and beautiful shop buildings that have been demolished and replaced by houses with no style, they are even more eye-catching. All of this has diminished the splendor of Beijing, a historical city that shines with ancient culture everywhere. This situation is still quite common throughout the country, so I cannot help but appeal to our city builders to cherish our architectural heritage and handle it with great caution. We cannot be spendthrifts who arbitrarily squander our heritage.

I also think that some of our cities with distinctive characteristics, such as Suzhou, Shaoxing, etc., should also be listed as cultural heritage conservation units. New construction can be planned outside the scope of the old city. Of course, it is also possible to preserve a village, a town, or a street in a planned way in certain areas. I think it is necessary to do so. I hope everyone will pay attention to this work.

    保护历史建筑物
            潘絜兹
    在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克四个月中，参观了许多城市，观感中印象最深的是这两个国家对古代建筑物的爱护。华沙的旧城和新城，是在战后一片瓦砾堆上按照原样恢复起来的。波兰北方革但斯克旧城、一条可以称得起金碧辉煌的大街，也是在废墟上重建的。战争中遭到严重破坏的许多纪念性建筑物如密茨凯维支和哥白尼的雕像等，都经艺术家细心修复，恢复旧观。在捷克斯洛伐克，列为文物保护单位的城市有三十多个，这些城市完全保存了中世纪的风貌；新的建设只能在指定的地区进行，旧城中一木一石的变动都要得到文物保管机关的许可。在布拉格，尽管有许多人叫嚷交通条件不好，但全城狭窄的中世纪的街道、胡同，仍被小心地保存着，甚至路灯都还用煤气。斯洛伐克首府布拉迪斯拉发也是如此。至于全国数以万计的古代宫堡、教堂等等，更是修整一新；连战前就已湮灭无存的纪念性建筑物，如布拉格的维弗列耶蒙斯基教堂（十五世纪杨·胡司曾在此传播革命思想），也根据文献和地下发掘材料恢复起来了。
    波、捷人民在社会主义建设中大力保护和修复各种古代建筑物，乃至整座整座的城市，是十分令人感动的。这决不能意味是保守或复古思想，乃是尊重自己民族历史的高度的爱国主义精神的表现。这些古代建筑物唤起了人们的历史感情，使人们缅怀过去时代和外国侵略者的艰苦斗争，了解先代人民的生活方式和他们在文化艺术各方面的成就。
    而且波、捷人民在保存古代建筑物的同时，还出色地解决了它和今日人民生活不相适应的矛盾。如开辟室内通廊，解决交通问题；改装内部，使古城居民仍能得到充分的现代化享受等等；总之是表现了尊重历史遗产和关心人民生活的一致性，不对任何一方采取粗暴的措施。
    由此我想到我们的城市建设者，大刀阔斧地将古代建筑物一座座地拆除的情形，感到十分难过。其实有许多是可以避免的，如穿越地下、绕行两旁等等，总可以想出一些办法。北京的东安门、西安门、地安门、三座门都消失了，街道上的牌楼也没有留下一座。至于那些古老美丽的商店建筑，被拆除而代替以毫无风格的房子，更是触目皆是。这一切都促使北京这座到处闪发着古代文化光辉的历史名城为之减色。这种情形在全国还是相当普遍的，因此我不能不向我们的城市建设者发出呼吁，请他们珍惜建筑遗产，要十分慎重地处理。我们不能做一个任意挥霍遗产的败家子。
    我还想到我国有一些具有鲜明特色的城市，如苏州、绍兴等等，也应该列为文物保护单位了。新的建设可以划在旧城范围以外。当然更可以有计划地在某些地区，保存一个村镇、一条街巷。这样做我想是有必要的。希望大家把这个工作重视起来。
