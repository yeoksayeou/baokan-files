The anti-American demonstrations triggered by the U.S. aggressors' abuse of extraterritoriality and the release of the murderer Reynolds in Taiwan are a stern warning to U.S. imperialism from the Taiwanese compatriots: Although the United States occupies Taiwan with its military power, it can never occupy the hearts of the Taiwanese compatriots. The Taiwanese compatriots will not allow the U.S. aggressors to turn our beautiful land into a U.S. colony, nor will they allow the U.S. aggressors to arbitrarily enslave and kill the Chinese people. In this incident, the Taiwanese compatriots demonstrated the patriotic tradition of the Chinese people. We extend our deep sympathy and greatest respect to the Taiwanese compatriots who are fighting against the brutal and shameless U.S. aggressors.

The acquittal of Reynolds, a U.S. military personnel who killed Liu Ziran in Taiwan, reminds us of many similar cases in China's nearly century-long history. During the period from the Opium War until the liberation of the Chinese people, our motherland became a paradise for imperialist adventurers. At that time, the imperialists arbitrarily killed and trampled on the Chinese people, invaded China, and demanded that China apologize to them and give them "compensation." At that time, we Chinese people, at the cost of sacrifice and bloodshed, rose up to oppose imperialist aggression and defend the glory of our motherland.

The blood of the martyrs who fought and fell one after another for nearly a century to oppose imperialist aggression was not shed in vain. Today, on the mainland of China, the Chinese people have become their own masters, and the forces of imperialist aggression have been driven away. Only Taiwan is still under the occupation of U.S. imperialism, and only the Taiwanese compatriots are still living in darkness. U.S. imperialism treats Taiwan as its colony, and it uses all the despicable means that colonialists have ever used, acting arrogantly and interfering in all aspects of Taiwan's affairs. The U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan beat and kill Taiwanese residents, rape women, and cause disturbances while drunk. They simply do not take the Chinese people of Taiwan seriously. In the eyes of the U.S. aggressors, the Taiwanese compatriots are nothing more than slaves at the disposal of the United States and cannon fodder needed for aggressive wars. Therefore, they can arbitrarily kill people without paying the price by relying on so-called "extraterritoriality."

The Taiwanese compatriots' indignation at the U.S. aggressors is entirely justified. All people with national self-esteem and patriotism cannot but feel indignant at the U.S. aggressors' shameless behavior of treating Taiwan as a colony, disregarding human life, and releasing murderers. The Taiwan media, and even some officials of the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities and many members of the Legislative Yuan, have expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' abuse of so-called "extraterritoriality" to release the murderer and demanded a retrial. This shows that they have the conscience that a Chinese person should have.

This patriotic struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots is also part of the worldwide struggle against U.S. aggression and expansion. Therefore, it is not only firmly supported by the six hundred million Chinese people on our mainland, but also by many righteous people in Asia and Africa who oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

Now, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, has secretly transported the murderer out of Taiwan, and on the other hand, it wants the Chiang Kai-shek clique to apologize and compensate it. However, Ye Gongchao, the "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and Dong Xian Guang, the "Ambassador" to the United States, not only did not argue with the United States on the basis of reason and demand that the murderer Reynolds be given the punishment he deserves, but instead, under the pressure of the United States, begged for mercy in a servile manner, showing no national integrity. However, these people cannot represent the Taiwanese compatriots at all. All patriotic people in Taiwan will never bow their heads to the U.S. aggressors. They are increasingly aware that there is no other way for them to avoid being arbitrarily abused and enslaved by the U.S. aggressors except to rise up and fight against the U.S. aggressors.

All patriotic forces in Taiwan, unite! Let us, under the banner of patriotism, work together to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Taiwan and peacefully reunify our great motherland!

    台湾的一切爱国力量团结起来
    美国侵略者在台湾滥用治外法权、释放杀人凶犯雷诺所引起的反美大示威，是台湾同胞对美帝国主义的一个严厉警告：美国虽然用它的军事力量占领了台湾，但是它绝对占领不了台湾同胞们的心。台湾同胞不容许美国侵略者把我们的锦绣河山变成美国的殖民地，不容许美国侵略者任意奴役和杀害中国人民。台湾同胞们在这一次事件中，表现出了中国人民的爱国主义的传统。我们向为反对残暴无耻的美国侵略者而斗争的台湾同胞们致以深切的同情和最大的敬意。
    侵占台湾的美军人员雷诺杀害刘自然以后，竟被宣告无罪释放，这件事使我们想起了中国近百年史上许多类似的案件。在从鸦片战争一直到中国人民获得解放前这一段时间里，我们的祖国变成了帝国主义冒险家的乐园。那时候，帝国主义者任意杀害和蹂躏了中国人，侵略了中国，还要中国向它们道歉，给它们“赔偿”。那时候，我们中国人民曾经不惜牺牲流血，奋起反对帝国主义的侵略，保卫我们祖国的光荣。
    近百年来前仆后继地为反对帝国主义侵略而斗争的先烈们的血没有白流。今天，在中国的大陆上，中国人民作了自己的主人，帝国主义侵略势力已经被赶走。只有台湾还在美帝国主义的侵占之下，只有台湾同胞还在过着暗无天日的日子。美帝国主义把台湾当成是它的殖民地，它袭用了一切殖民主义者曾经用过的卑鄙手段，骄横恣肆，干涉台湾各方面的事务。驻在台湾的美国军事人员，殴打和残杀台湾居民，奸淫妇女，酗酒闹事。他们根本不把台湾的中国人民放在眼里。在美国侵略者看来，台湾同胞不过是美国任意驱策的奴隶和进行侵略战争所需要的炮灰。因此他们可以凭着所谓“治外法权”，任意杀人而不必偿命。
    台湾同胞对美国侵略者的愤慨，是完全正当的。一切有民族自尊心和爱国的人，对美国侵略者把台湾当作殖民地、草菅人命、释放杀人凶犯的无耻行为都不能不感到愤慨。台湾的舆论界，甚至台湾国民党当局的一些官员和立法院的许多委员们，都对美国滥用所谓“治外法权”释放凶手表示不满，要求重新审理。这表明他们是有作为一个中国人应有的良心的。
    台湾同胞们的这个爱国主义的斗争，也是全世界反对美国侵略扩张的斗争的一部分。因此，它不但受到我们大陆上的六亿中国人民的坚决支持，而且受到了亚洲和非洲许多有正义感的、反对美帝国主义侵略的人民的支持。
    现在，美帝国主义一面把这个杀人凶手偷运出了台湾，一面还要蒋介石集团向它道歉、赔偿。而蒋介石集团的“外交部长”叶公超和驻美“大使”董显光，却不但不向美国据理力争，要求给凶手雷诺以应得的刑罚，反而在美国的压力之下，奴颜婢膝地请罪求饶，显得毫无民族气节。但是，这些人根本就不能代表台湾同胞。台湾的一切爱国人士们是决不会向美国侵略者低头的。他们越来越觉悟到，除了起来同美国侵略者进行斗争以外，没有别的道路可以使他们避免被美国侵略者任意虐杀、奴役的命运。
    台湾的一切爱国力量，团结起来！让我们在爱国主义的旗帜下，为把美国侵略者赶出台湾、和平统一我们伟大祖国而共同努力！
