    Unity
    Chen Bochui
    The school implemented a "two-shift system," and the three children only attended school for half a day, coincidentally all in the afternoon at home.

    The days stretched like years, and the children were really unable to stay still. Arguing, fighting, crying, laughing, and even fighting became a daily routine in the family.

    One afternoon, this bad lesson began again.

    The mother couldn't persuade them, they wouldn't listen, and she was at her wit's end. Suddenly, she heard someone outside calling out to sell chicks, so she took the children, who had only been arguing for half the time, to see.

    The chicks were so cute. They chirped, "Cheep, cheep!" and took small steps, running around, hopping and skipping, looking for food.

    The mother said, "Look, the chicks are all together, harmonious and friendly, how wonderful!"

    The youngest sister pouted and said, "We can be harmonious too." A tear hanging on her cheek fell down.

    The younger brother followed up earnestly, "We won't quarrel anymore in the future."

    The children watched for half an hour and were still unwilling to leave. They looked at the chicks, then raised their heads to look at their mother.

    The mother took out money from her pocket and bought three pairs.

    The youngest sister scrambled to say, "I want two yellow ones. I want them."

    "Give me the two black ones." The younger brother certainly didn't want to be left behind.

    This time the older brother was very generous. "Then, the remaining two spotted ones can be mine."

    "That won't do," the mother said, "Chicks like to play together, eat together, and sleep together."

    "Then we'll raise them together, don't separate them," the younger brother said, looking at his older brother.

    The older brother didn't say anything.

    "That won't do either," the mother said again. "You will argue, fight, and quarrel."

    "No, we'll be as harmonious as the chicks," the youngest sister said innocently, with wide eyes. She stretched out one hand to hold her older brother and one hand to hold her younger brother.

    The mother was really happy in her heart. The six chicks were six saviors, who had rescued her from the noisy world.

    She smiled and said, "Okay, you volunteered, you raise them yourselves."

    "We'll raise them," the younger brother agreed immediately.

    "When they grow up and lay eggs, give one to Mom, one to Dad, and one to Grandma." In the youngest sister's eyes, it seemed that the six chicks were six round, moving eggs.

    The older brother also spoke up. "If there are too many eggs, we can't finish them, we'll sell them to the cooperative."

    The mother then asked them, "Where are you going to raise the chicks? They also need a home."

    The youngest sister and younger brother were both stunned, blinking their eyes, looking at each other.

    This time, the older brother was willing to help again. He ran into the room and brought out his beloved large cardboard box, squinting one eye, and asked with a smile, "Is this okay? It's just a paper house."

    "Okay." The mother carefully picked up the chicks one by one and gently put them into the large cardboard box.

    The children squatted down, widened their eyes, and counted in unison: "One, two, three, four,..."

    The youngest sister suddenly clapped her hands, jumped up and down, and said to her mother, "Mom, are you holding a baby?"

    "That's right, they are children! You take good care of them."

    The older brother joked, "Then, the youngest sister will be a little mom."

    The youngest sister turned her head, stretched out her little foot, and kicked the cardboard box. "Go away!" She hid shyly in her mother's arms.

    The chicks were startled, "Cheep, cheep!" they gathered together, crowding each other.

    "They are having a meeting!" the younger brother shouted loudly.

    The older brother shook his head. "No. They think there's a big earthquake, they're scared!"

    The mother smiled. "Look, when they encounter danger, they take care of each other."

    "Um—" The older brother nodded. "They are united."

    The mother stood up, walking and looking back, saying, "I'll get the food for the chicks. You watch them. Be careful of Ah Hua (the cat)!"

    The room was very quiet.

    The chicks were chirping again, "Cheep, cheep!" taking small steps, hopping and skipping, looking very happy. The disaster had not happened, and the world was peaceful again.

    The mother, carrying a handful of bran and rice husks, ran back from the kitchen, but the children were gone, which was very strange. Suddenly, she heard a sound of laughter. Looking, she saw the three children in the corner of the room, opening their arms, embracing each other.

    "What's wrong, don't you like the chicks anymore?"

    The younger brother raised his small voice and replied, "We are also united!"

    团结
    陈伯吹
    学校里实行“二部制”，三个孩子只上半天学，凑巧都是下半天在家里。
    日长如小年，孩子们实在闲不住。吵嘴，争夺，哭，笑，甚至于要打架，竟成为家庭里的日常功课了。
    这一天下午，这门不好的功课又开始了。
    妈妈劝不理，喊不应，正愁得没办法。忽听得门外叫卖小鸡的，就带着才吵了半场的孩子们看去。
    小鸡们真可爱。“啾啾！啾啾！”地叫，迈着小步子，奔来奔去，还一跳一跳的，找东西吃。
    妈妈说：“你们看，小鸡们大伙儿在一起，和和气气的，多棒！”
    小妹噘着嘴说：“我们也会和气。”她腮帮上挂着的一颗眼泪掉了下来。
    小弟接着认真地说：“以后咱们就不吵架。”
    孩子们看了半个钟头，还不肯走。他们望望小鸡，又抬起头来望望妈妈。
    妈妈从衣袋里掏出钱来，买了三对。
    小妹抢着说：“我爱两只黄的。我要。”
      “两只黑的给我。”小弟弟当然不肯落后。
    这一回小哥可大方了。“那么，剩下来两只花的就算归我。”
      “不成，”妈妈说：“小鸡爱在一块儿玩，一块儿吃，一块儿睡觉。”
      “那我们就养在一块儿，不要分了。”小弟说着，看了看小哥。
    小哥没吱声。
    “也不成，”妈妈又说。“你们会吵嘴、争夺、打架的。”
      “不会。我们也像小鸡一样和和气气。”小妹瞪着大眼睛，天真地说。她伸出一只手拉着小哥，一只手拉着小弟。
    妈妈心里头真高兴，六只小鸡是六颗救星，可把她从吵吵闹闹的世界里救驾出来了。
    她笑眯眯地，“好，你们自愿的，你们自己养。”
      “我们养。”小弟一口答应下来。
      “养大了下蛋，给妈妈一个，给爸爸一个，给奶奶一个。”小妹眼睛里，仿佛六只小鸡就是六个滚圆的活动的蛋。
    小哥也开口了。“蛋下多了，咱们自己吃不完，卖给合作社。”
    妈妈就问他们：“你们把小鸡养在哪儿？它们也要有个家。”
    小妹和小弟都楞住了，眨眨眼睛，你看看我，我看看你。
    这一回又是小哥挺肯出力。他跑到房间里去，把自己一只心爱的大纸匣捧了出来，眯缝着一只眼睛，笑嘻嘻地问：“这个可行？不过是一幢纸头房子啰。”
      “行。”妈妈小心地把小鸡一只又一只地捉起来，轻轻地放到大纸匣里头去。
    孩子们蹲下身来，睁大了眼睛，齐声数着：“一，二，三，四，……”
    小妹忽地拍拍手，跳跳脚，对妈妈说：“妈妈，你在抱小孩不是？”
      “就是，它们是小孩子呀！你们好好养它们。”
    小哥开起玩笑来。“那，小妹要当小妈妈啦。”
    小妹头一扭，伸着小脚踢了踢纸匣。“去！”害臊得躲到妈妈怀里。
    小鸡们吃了一惊，“啾啾！啾啾！”地奔拢来，挤在一块儿。
      “它们在开会啦！”小弟大声叫出来。
    是小哥摇了摇头。“不的。它们以为大地震了，害怕！”
    妈妈微笑着。“你们看，它们遇到危险，就互相爱护。”
      “嗯——”小哥点了点头。“他们团结。”
    妈妈站起身来，边走边回头说：“我拿小鸡吃的食来。你们看着它们。留心阿花（猫）！”
    屋子里很安静。
    小鸡又在“啾啾！啾啾！”地叫，迈着小步子，还一跳一跳的，十分快活的样子。灾难没有发生，世界又和平了。
    妈妈兜着一把糠粞，从厨房里跑回来，却不见了孩子们，真奇怪。忽听得有个声音笑出来，一看，三个孩子在屋角落里，张开手臂，抱做一团。
    “怎么啦，不喜欢小鸡了？”
    小弟提高小嗓子回答说：“我们也团结！”
