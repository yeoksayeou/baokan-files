Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 9th. Indonesian Minister of Justice Maengkom issued an emergency decree on the 8th regarding the establishment of the National Council proposed by President Sukarno.

The emergency decree, signed by the President and the Prime Minister, states that in order to best arrange the affairs of the country, it is necessary to establish a National Council. The task of the National Council is to provide the government with advice on major national affairs – including political, military, economic, financial and social issues. This advice will be conveyed to the government through the President.

The council will be led by the President, with a Vice-Chairman assisting the President. Its members will be appointed by the President and will include: (a) representatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, national entrepreneurs, Muslim scholars, Catholics, Christians, women, youth, and "participants in the 1945 Revolution"; (b) leaders from various regions; (c) military and civilian authorities deemed necessary to participate in the council; and (d) relevant cabinet ministers. Other ministers may attend council meetings to provide necessary explanations on certain matters.

The council will be located in Jakarta, and it may convene meetings when deemed necessary by the President, the Vice-Chairman of the Council, or at least five members.

The annotation to the decree states that Indonesia's political system is parliamentary democracy. However, the development of national life has proven that there is a need for other efforts to absorb the developing forces within society, forces that have not yet been satisfactorily absorbed into existing institutions. The government's aim is to effectively utilize these forces in order to smoothly administer the country by absorbing these forces into the National Council.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 9th. A spokesman for the Jakarta Garrison Command announced today that Izhar, the Jakarta commissioner of the "Wild Bull Division Committee" of Central Sumatra, was arrested by the Jakarta military yesterday morning. An army captain named Syamsuddin was arrested along with Izhar.

The spokesman said that this action was taken to maintain law and order in Jakarta because signs of possible endangerment to national security and unity had been discovered.

It is said that in recent searches launched by the military in some parts of the city, a number of soldiers and civilians have been detained, including Shaf, the editor-in-chief of the "Observer" newspaper, who is close to the Masyumi Party.

    印度尼西亚颁令建立民族委员会
    委员会任务是向政府提供有关国家主要事务的建议
    雅加达军方逮捕“雄牛师委员会”代表
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚司法部长马恩科姆8日颁布了关于建立苏加诺总统所建议的民族委员会的紧急法令。
    由总统和总理签署的这个紧急法令说，为了能够最好地安排国家的事务，有必要成立民族委员会。民族委员会的任务是向政府提供关于国家主要事务——包括政治、军事、经济、财政和社会问题在内——的建议。这种建议将通过总统转达给政府。
    委员会将由总统领导，有一位副主席协助总统工作。它的委员将由总统任命，委员包括：（甲）工人、农民、知识分子、民族企业家、穆斯林学者、天主教徒、基督教徒、妇女、青年、“1945年革命参加者”等的代表；（乙）各地区领导人；（丙）认为有必要参加委员会的军事和民政当局；（丁）有关的几位内阁部长。其他的部长可以参加委员会的会议，在会议上对一些事情进行一些必要的解释。
    委员会将设在雅加达，它可以在总统、委员会的副主席或者至少五名委员认为必要时召开会议。
    法令的注释说，印度尼西亚的政体是议会民主。但是国家生活的发展证明，还有必要进行其他努力，以便吸收社会范围内不断发展的力量，这些力量目前还没有令人满意地吸收到现有的各种机构中去。政府的目的是要有效地利用这些力量，以便顺利地管理这个国家，方法是把这些力量吸收到民族委员会中去。
    新华社雅加达9日电　雅加达卫戍司令部发言人今天说，中苏门答腊“雄牛师委员会”驻雅加达的专员伊兹哈尔昨天早上已经被雅加达军方逮捕。和伊兹哈尔一起被捕的还有一个叫做夏姆苏丁的上尉。
    发言人说，采取这个行动是为了维护雅加达的治安和秩序，因为发现了可能危及国家的安全和统一的迹象。
    据说，最近军方在市内一些地方发动的搜查中，已经扣押了一批军人和平民，其中包括接近马斯友美党的“观察报”的总编辑沙夫。
