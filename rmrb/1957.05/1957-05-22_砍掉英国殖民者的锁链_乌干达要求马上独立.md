Break the Chains of British Colonialists
Uganda Demands Immediate Independence

    This newspaper reports that the movement for independence among the people of Uganda, a British protectorate in East Africa, has made new progress.
    The Uganda National Congress held a week-long conference in Kampala (the location of the Buganda provincial government and a commercial center) starting on May 13th. Simultaneously, a series of mass rallies were held throughout Uganda, launching a massive "Immediate Independence Struggle" week.
    In a declaration issued before the meeting, the Uganda National Congress summarized the party's practical program. The declaration stated that the Uganda National Congress demands the realization of Uganda's complete independence and becoming a formal member of the British Commonwealth. To this end, the Uganda National Congress put forward the following four immediate goals: to hold direct elections nationwide on the basis of universal suffrage; to unify the various tribes of Uganda into a unified African nation, with each tribe retaining its original system; to fully "Africanize" Uganda and create conditions for Africans to fully participate in various activities in the industrial and commercial fields.
    Since World War II, the people of Uganda have widely launched struggles for independence and against British colonial rule. The Uganda National Congress was founded in 1952. It is Uganda's largest political organization, with a reported membership of approximately 100,000. Its task is to unite the various ethnic groups of Uganda to fight for autonomy, universal suffrage, and popular control of the economy. In June 1955, it sent a delegation to London to submit a memorandum to Britain demanding political independence. Subsequently, in April 1956, the people of Uganda once again launched a mass movement demanding autonomy.

    砍掉英国殖民者的锁链
    乌干达要求马上独立
    本报讯　英属东非的保护国乌干达人民要求独立的运动，有了新的进展。
    乌干达国大党从5月13日起，在坎帕拉（布干达省政府所在地和商业中心）举行了为期一周的会议。同时，乌干达各地也举行了一系列的群众集会，掀起了声势浩大的争取“马上独立斗争”周。
    乌干达国大党在会前发表的一项宣言中，概括地阐述了这个党的实际纲领。宣言说，乌干达国大党要求实现乌干达的完全独立和成为英联邦的一个正式成员。为此目的，乌干达国大党提出当前的四点奋斗目标：在普遍有选举权的基础上在全国进行直接选举；乌干达各部落在各保留其原有制度的条件下统一成为一个统一的非洲国家；乌干达充分“非洲化”和创造条件使非洲人充分参加工商业领域内的各项活动。
    乌干达人民在第二次世界大战以后，广泛地展开了要求独立和反对英国殖民统治的斗争。乌干达国大党成立于1952年。这是乌干达最大的政治组织，据说有党员约十万人。它的任务是联合乌干达各族人民为争取自治、普选权利和由人民掌握经济而斗争。1955年6月，它曾派代表团到伦敦，向英国提出一份要求政治独立的备忘录。之后，1956年4月，乌干达人民再次展开了要求自治的群众运动。
