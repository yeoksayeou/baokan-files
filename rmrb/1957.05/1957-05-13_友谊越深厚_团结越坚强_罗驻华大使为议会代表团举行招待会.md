Xinhua News Agency, May 12th. Romanian Ambassador to China, Teodor Rudenco, held a reception this evening to welcome all members of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and Bucharest City People's Council delegation headed by Constantin Pârvulescu.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

Chairman Pârvulescu spoke at the reception (see page 3). He said that the friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people is robust and increasingly prosperous, because the spring of mankind—socialism—is deeply rooted in the fertile land of our two countries and unites us in the socialist camp, guiding us to abide by the principle of "one for all, all for one."

Pârvulescu said that the Romanian people believe that contributing all their strength to the continuous consolidation of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is their highest task.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke (see page 3). He said that we, the Chinese people, highly cherish the close friendship and unity with the Romanian people. This friendship and unity is in line with the interests of the Chinese and Romanian people and the people of all countries in the world. The deeper our friendship and the stronger our unity, the more conducive it will be to promoting the socialist construction of our two countries, the more it will strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the more it will safeguard the cause of world peace.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi congratulated the Romanian people on their greater achievements in socialist construction.

Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast at the reception to the success of Romania's peaceful foreign policy and socialist construction, to the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people, to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to world peace, and to the health of Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica and his wife.

Delegation member An. Flredoiu and Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen proposed toasts to the friendship between Bucharest and Beijing.

Ambassador Teodor Rudenco delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception. He said that the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations between China and Romania have contributed to strengthening the friendship between our two peoples, to understanding the achievements we have made in socialist construction, and to developing the relations between our two countries on the basis of the Leninist principle of equality of all nations and on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

The Ambassador proposed a toast to the health of those present at this gathering, to the great friendship between the two peoples, to the continued strengthening of the friendship between the two countries, and to the great Chinese people.

Also present at the reception tonight were Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Vice-Premier Nie Rongzhen, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and heads of various departments of the government and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.
