Less Money, More Work

    Fewer Repair Shops Can Be Built
    By Our Correspondent Gu Lei
    Recently, with the help of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this reporter invited comrades from the repair shops of several factories to discuss the construction of repair shops. Those who participated in the discussion included Zhou Zhongming from the Lanzhou Refinery, Yan Zhenchang from the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, Zhao Zhiqin from the Lanzhou Waterworks, and Wang Zhigeng from the Xigu Thermal Power Plant. At the meeting, they all said that the repair shops were built too large, resulting in significant waste.
    The scale of the repair shops in each factory is as follows:
    Fertilizer Plant: Building area of 4,500 square meters; investment of over 4.8 million yuan; 139 employees; mechanical processing capacity of 985 tons, riveting and welding capacity of 950 tons, casting capacity of 445 tons.
    Refinery: Building area of 5,000 square meters; investment of 5.96 million yuan; 529 employees; processing capacity of 9,500 tons (including the weight of the parts being repaired).
    Waterworks: Building area of 3,400 square meters; investment of 1.2 million yuan; 150 employees; capable of repairing motors and water meters, and can produce water meters for sale in large quantities.
    Xigu Thermal Power Plant: Building area of 1,250 square meters; investment of 251,000 yuan; approximately 20 employees; processing capacity just sufficient to meet the needs of repair work.
    In addition, according to reports, the repair shop of the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant has a building area of 1,353 square meters; an investment of 2.83 million yuan; and 226 employees. The repair shop of the Refining and Chemical Equipment Plant has a building area of 1,834 square meters; an investment of 1.28 million yuan; and 115 employees. The processing capacity of both workshops is over 200 tons.
    In addition to having repair shops, each of the above factories also has several machines installed in each production workshop to repair minor issues at any time.
    Why did these factories build such large workshops with complete processing capabilities? According to the comrades who participated in the discussion, there are two main reasons: one is to calculate the percentage of wear and tear of the factory's production equipment each year to determine the processing capacity of the repair shop; the other is to use the workload of major, medium, and minor repairs, especially the workload during major repairs, as the basis for determining the maximum processing capacity of the repair shop. As for the ideological roots, they are nothing more than these: a desire for formality, comprehensiveness, and completeness; a desire to "not have to ask anyone for anything"; and a lack of a sense of thrift, etc.
    Regardless of who should be responsible, the waste caused by this approach is significant.
    The first waste: New factories are equipped with new equipment, which cannot be severely worn in one or two years and does not need to be overhauled immediately. This means that the repair shop's repair capacity cannot be fully utilized in the first two or three years of production. Moreover, even after two or three years when the equipment needs major repairs, it is impossible to overhaul it every month or every quarter, and the repair shop's tasks will still not be fully scheduled.
    The second waste: Each repair shop is "small but complete," with all kinds of equipment, but some equipment is often idle. For example, the repair shop of the fertilizer plant has a large rolling mill that can press 30 mm thick and 3-meter wide iron plates, but in reality, there is very little such work in a year, and the machine often has to be idled. This workshop also has 750 kg and 300 kg steam hammers, each of which is only used a few times a year. The refinery repair shop has many precision machine tools, which are also not used much in a year.
    The third waste: Although each factory has prepared for major repairs, in reality, there are many tasks that they cannot do themselves during major repairs. For example, the repair shop of the fertilizer plant is relatively large and well-equipped, but it still cannot make the cylinders, cylinder liners, large ring gears, or large castings of large compressors during major repairs, and it still needs to ask outside factories for help. Since the repair shop is prepared according to the needs of major repairs, but it cannot handle all the work of major repairs, this is naturally not an economical approach.
    The fourth waste: Each factory establishes its own repair shop, which is equally uneconomical in terms of land use, allocation of management personnel, technical personnel, and workers.
    The comrades who participated in the discussion also put forward suggestions to avoid this waste.
    One suggestion is: It is absolutely necessary for any large factory to have a repair shop. It can inspect and repair equipment in a timely manner, eliminate equipment accidents at any time, and ensure smooth production. However, the scale of this repair shop should be very small, the production capacity should be greatly reduced, and the equipment should be simplified. In any case, it should not be built according to the workload during major repairs. The production capacity of the repair shop should at least be controlled below the medium repair capacity. When calculating the medium repair capacity, it is also necessary to fully estimate the work that may be sent to outside factories for processing.
    Another suggestion is: To establish a relatively large-scale central mechanical repair plant in the center of an industrial area to undertake the equipment processing tasks required for major or medium repairs of various factories in the area. After meeting the needs of major repairs of each factory, this central mechanical repair plant can also use its surplus production capacity to produce regional or national standard parts or products for export.
    Another suggestion is: Factories that have already built larger repair shops should take on some work from outside factories when they have surplus capacity. A better way is to request the state to assign certain production tasks to produce a simpler product. Most people prefer the latter approach.
    During the discussion, everyone also estimated the possible difficulties in establishing a central mechanical repair plant, which are roughly as follows: An industrial area has factories from various ministries. Who should design and build this central mechanical repair plant? The nature of each factory is different, and the requirements are also different. How should such a factory be designed? After the central mechanical repair plant is built, how can the needs of each factory be met through planning, and how can it be guaranteed that it will not affect production? The central repair plant will serve various types of enterprises. What kind of equipment and technical strength should it have? Because everyone has no experience, they are just raising the questions. However, everyone believes that this is a way to save a lot of construction funds, and as long as the relevant departments pay attention to this matter, these problems can be solved and the difficulties can be overcome.

    可以少建修理车间
    本报记者　顾雷
    最近，记者在中共兰州市委的帮助下，约了几个工厂的修理车间的同志，座谈建设修理车间的问题。参加座谈的有兰州炼油厂的周钟明、兰州肥料厂的严振常、兰州自来水厂的赵志勤、西崮热电站的王志耕。会上，他们都说修理车间盖大了，造成了很大的浪费。
    各厂修理车间的规模是这样的：
    肥料厂：建筑面积四千五百平方公尺；投资四百八十余万元；职工一百三十九人；机械加工能力九百八十五吨、铆焊能力九百五十吨、铸造能力四百四十五吨。
    炼油厂：建筑面积五千平方公尺；投资五百九十六万元；职工五百二十九人；加工能力九千五百吨（包括被修理部件的重量在内）。
    自来水厂：建筑面积三千四百平方公尺；投资一百二十万元；职工一百五十人；可以修理电动机、水表，而且可以大量生产水表外销。
    西崮热电站：建筑面积一千二百五十平方公尺；投资二十五万一千元；职工约二十人；加工能力刚能够满足修理工作的需要。
    此外，据了解，兰州石油机械厂的修理车间，建筑面积有一千三百五十三平方公尺；投资二百八十三万元；职工有二百二十六人。炼油化工设备厂的修理车间建筑面积一千八百三十四平方公尺；投资一百二十八万元；职工有一百十五人。这两个车间的加工能力都有二百多吨。
    上述这些工厂，除了有修理车间外，各生产车间里也都装上几台机器，随时修理些零活。
    这些工厂为什么要建设这样大的有完整加工能力的车间呢？据参加座谈的同志们说，主要根据有两个：一个是按照本厂生产设备每年磨损的情况，计算出百分比来，确定修理车间的加工能力；另一个是把设备的大修、中修、小修的工作量，特别是把大修时的工作量，当作确定修理车间最高加工能力的依据。至于思想上的根源，则不外乎这样几个：愿意正规、全套、完整；希望“万事不求人”；缺乏节约观念，等等。
    不管责任应当由谁来负，但是，这种做法所造成的浪费是很大的。
    第一个浪费：新工厂装的是新设备，不可能在一两年内磨损得很严重，不需要马上进行大修。这就是说，在开始生产的两三年内，修理车间的修理能力不可能充分发挥。而且，在两三年后，设备需要大修了，也不可能月月、季季大修，修理车间的任务仍然排不满。
    第二个浪费：各个修理车间“麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”，什么样的设备都有，而有些设备是经常没有活干的。例如，肥料厂修理车间有一台大滚床，可以压三十公厘厚、三公尺宽的铁板，实际上在一年里面这样的活很少，机器不得不时常闲置起来。这个车间还有七百五十公斤和三百公斤的汽锤各一台，一年也用不了几次。炼油厂修理车间有许多精密的机床，也是一年里开动不了几回。
    第三个浪费：各厂虽然准备了大修的能力，实际上在进行大修的时候，又有许多活是自己不能干的。如肥料厂的修理车间比较大，设备也较好，大修时仍然不能做大压缩机的汽缸、汽缸套、大牙轮、大的铸件，仍然要请外厂帮助。既然修理车间是按照大修的需要准备的，又不能把大修的活全部包下来，这自然不能算作经济的做法。
    第四个浪费：各厂都建立自己的修理车间，在使用土地、配置管理人员、技术人员和工人方面，当然同样的不经济。
    参加座谈的同志们也提出了避免这种浪费的意见。
    一个意见是：任何一个大工厂，有一个修理车间是完全必要的。它可以及时检修设备，随时排除设备事故，保证顺利进行生产。但是，这个修理车间的规模要很小，生产能力要大大压缩，设备要简化，无论如何不宜依照大修时的工作量进行建筑。修理车间的生产能力，起码要控制在中修能力之下。而计算中修的能力时，还应当充分估计到可能送到外厂加工的活。
    另一个意见是：在一个工业区的中心，建立一个相当规模的中心机械修理厂，担任这个地区各个工厂的大修或中修所需要的设备加工任务。这个中心机械修理厂在满足各厂大修理所需要的产品之后，还可以用富余的生产能力，生产地区性的或全国性的标准件或外销产品。
    再一个意见是：现在已经建起了较大的修理车间的工厂，应当在能力有剩余的时候，到外厂揽一部分活做。更好的办法是请求国家分配给一定的生产任务，生产某一种较简单的产品。多数人都更赞成后一种做法。
    座谈中，大家对建立中心机械修理厂可能遇到的困难也估计了一下，大概有这样几个：一个工业区有各个部的工厂，这个中心机械修理厂由谁来设计、建设？各个工厂的性质不一样，要求也各不相同，设计这样的工厂应当怎样？中心机械修理厂建成以后，如何通过计划，满足各厂的需要，而且保证不影响生产？中心修理厂要为各种类型的企业服务，它应当拥有怎样的设备同技术力量？因为大家都没有经验，只是把问题提出来了。但是，大家都相信：这是一个能够大量节省建设资金的做法，只要有关部门重视这件事，这些问题是可以解决的，困难是可以克服的。
