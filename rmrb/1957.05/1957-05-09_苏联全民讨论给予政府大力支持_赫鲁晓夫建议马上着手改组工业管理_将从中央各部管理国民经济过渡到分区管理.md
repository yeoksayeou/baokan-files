Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th dispatch: According to TASS, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a report on further improving the organization of industrial and construction management at the joint session of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 7th.

Khrushchev said that during the preparation for this meeting, the discussion of this issue was truly nationwide in nature. From March 30th to May 4th, 514,000 meetings were organized across the country with the participation of 40,082,000 workers, of whom more than 2.3 million people put forward opinions and suggestions on improving the leadership of industrial and construction work. The central and local newspapers widely reported on the discussion of this issue. More than 68,000 people published their suggestions, opinions and supplements in newspapers.

The Soviet People Unanimously and Enthusiastically Support the Measures to Further Improve the Organization of Industrial and Construction Management

Khrushchev said that this discussion is another vivid manifestation of Soviet democracy. It convincingly proves that the Soviet Union guarantees the broadest participation of millions of working people in deciding the fundamental issues of national economic development, not just in words but in actual deeds. Conducting nationwide discussions on such important issues is a concrete example of realizing Lenin's principle of collective leadership and the close connection between the leadership and the people. This close connection means that the Party and the government consult with the people when studying the important tasks in communist construction, and the collective wisdom of the people can help find the most correct solutions.

Khrushchev continued that the Soviet people unanimously and enthusiastically support the measures proposed by the Party and the government to further improve the organization of industrial and construction management. They believe that these measures are very timely and in line with Lenin's principles of socialist economic management.

Khrushchev pointed out that many valuable suggestions were put forward in the discussion, suggesting how to better organize the management of industrial and construction work taking into account the specific conditions and characteristics of various economic regions and sectors of the national economy. Many correct criticisms were raised in the discussion, exposing serious shortcomings in the work of various ministries and competent authorities, planning agencies, Soviets, Party and trade union organizations. These suggestions and criticisms enable us to lead economic construction work more perfectly and flexibly, and at the same time help to promote more and more talented organizers and specialized personnel to the posts in various sectors of economic construction.

Khrushchev said that the experience accumulated in developing the national economy during the years of Soviet power has confirmed that Lenin's principles of managing socialist construction have great vitality. As early as the beginning of Soviet power, Lenin said that the principle of democratic centralism should become the basic principle of socialist economy, because it can correctly combine the centralized leadership of the state over the economy with the highly developed creative initiative of the working masses. Centralization in the truly democratic sense presupposes a historically unprecedented condition, namely, the full and unrestricted development not only of local characteristics, but also of local initiative and enterprise, and of the variety of ways, methods and means of attaining the common goal.

Rapid Industrial Development and Large-Scale Construction Make it Necessary to Further Improve the Forms and Methods of Management

Khrushchev said, why reorganize the management structure? Our industry is very good and has made great achievements. This is undeniable. However, precisely because of the extremely rapid industrial development and the unprecedented scale of construction, it is necessary to further improve the forms and methods of management.

Khrushchev went on to point out that the reorganization of industrial and construction management structures that we plan to implement will help overcome many of the shortcomings we are now finding, bring leadership closer to production, and more effectively combat bureaucracy. However, the reorganization itself will not eliminate bureaucracy, because bureaucrats will not disappear from the ground. Therefore, do not slack off, but redouble your efforts to combat all kinds of bureaucratic phenomena. The broader the masses of working people and all our social organizations are involved in this important work, the smoother the struggle will be.

Khrushchev said that the national economy at the current stage of development requires further upsurge, and it is necessary to shift the focus of effective leadership of industry and construction to the local level, so that it is closer to enterprises and construction sites. To achieve this, it is necessary to transition from the form of central ministries and competent authorities managing the national economy to the form of zonal management.

The Reorganization of Management Must be Carried out in May and June of this Year, and Confusion Should be Avoided During the Transition Period

Khrushchev announced that the proposals on the establishment of national economic committees and the proposals on the abolition or reorganization of the existing all-Union and republic industrial ministries, construction ministries and competent authorities will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review.

Khrushchev said that for the industrial ministries and construction ministries, it is recommended to retain the following all-Union ministries: Ministry of Aviation Industry, Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry, Ministry of Radio Industry, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Medium Machine Building Industry, and Ministry of Transport Construction. And it is recommended that the Ministry of Defense Industries be merged with the Ministry of General Machine Building, and the Ministry of Power Stations be merged with the Ministry of Power Station Construction. However, these ministries must be fundamentally reorganized. They must get rid of the work of directly managing the corresponding enterprises and only retain the power of planning and overall technical leadership of the enterprises. There is no need to set up all-Union ministries for the coal mining industry and the petroleum industry, as well as the iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metallurgy industry, because their enterprises are mainly distributed in the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian Republic, the Kazakh Republic and the Azerbaijani Republic. It is appropriate to establish republican ministries. The Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry, the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Industry and the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry can be established in the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry and the Ministry of Coal Mining Industry can be established in the Ukrainian Republic, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry can be established in the Russian Federation and the Azerbaijani Republic. It is more appropriate for the republican ministries to be located closer to production.

The industrial enterprises and construction sites of the ministries that are retained and the industrial enterprises and construction sites of the ministries that are abolished will be transferred to the management of the National Economic Committees, which will implement the direct leadership of these enterprises through the corresponding regional management agencies.

Khrushchev believes that the work of reorganization management should not be delayed, and this work must be carried out in May and June of this year.

Khrushchev continued that many border areas and states have highly developed industries and constitute quite large economic zones in themselves, not to mention the various allied republics. But it is not necessary to establish national economic committees in every state. In some places, it seems appropriate for several states to unite. But we should not be enthusiastic about this now, so as to avoid confusion during the transition to new forms of management.

Khrushchev said that an economic and administrative regional table was submitted to the meeting for study. He said that it is planned to establish ninety-two national economic committees, including sixty-eight in the Russian Federation, eleven in the Ukrainian Republic, and one in each of the other allied republics.

The current industrial division into all-Union, allied republic, republic and local industries must be changed to two forms of affiliation in the future: allied republic industries managed by the national economic committees and local industries directly subordinate to the Soviet of Working People's Representatives.

During the discussion of the outline, some comrades suggested that the National Economic Committees should be subordinate to the executive committees of the Soviets of Working People's Representatives of the border areas and states. Khrushchev believes that this is not appropriate at present.

The Development of Industrial Specialization and Collaboration and the Strengthening of Planning Work Will Help Give Play to the Strong Potential in the National Economy

Khrushchev spoke in particular about the development of industrial specialization and collaboration. He pointed out that the collaboration of production now has a particularly internal nature, and it is still far from perfect. The production collaboration between enterprises of various ministries according to economic regions is actually poorly implemented, which of course hinders the fullest utilization of the production capacity of various enterprises. Many staff members of the ministries are afraid of specialization and extensive collaboration, because this involves certain changes to the established forms of production organization. They try to keep everything in the existing factories intact and work in the old way.

With the establishment of economic zones and the organization of national economic committees, and with the abolition of many specialized departments and bureaus, we will soon have the opportunity to implement specialization and collaboration of production on the widest scale. Rationally organizing the specialization and collaboration of production through the national economic committees will help to give fuller play to the existing strong potential in the national economy.

Khrushchev then talked about the issue of planning work. He emphasized that the Party and the government attach special importance to further strengthening the planning basis for national economic development. The Soviet State Planning Committee should become the Soviet national economy's scientific economic planning agency. Its task is to deeply and comprehensively study the needs of the national economy, collate scientific and technological achievements, and on this basis formulate proposals for the development of various sectors of the national economy (the proposals must carefully consider the possibility of comprehensive economic development) and rationally utilize resources according to national interests. Under the new circumstances, national economic plans should be compiled from the perspective of the allied republics and economic administrative regions. The Soviet State Planning Committee should ensure the correct proportional development of various sectors of the Soviet national economy and examine the plans of various allied republics and regions from this position.

Khrushchev emphasized that it is necessary to greatly improve long-term planning work. In addition to annual plans and five-year plans, the State Planning Committee should also formulate longer-term perspective plans for the entire country and various sectors.

When formulating national economic plans, local experience must be taken into account as much as possible. Therefore, the formulation of plans should start from the enterprises, and then be carried out sequentially by economic joint ventures, national economic committees and republic state planning committees, and finally formulated by the Soviet State Planning Committee.

The Reorganization of Management Forms Has Huge Economic and Political Significance, Which Is a New Stage in the Further Development of the Soviet Socialist Economy

Khrushchev said that the reorganization of industrial and construction management forms is of great significance for further expanding the rights of the allied republics and leading economic construction. In addition to its huge economic significance, the proposed measures also have extremely important political significance, because these measures mark a new step in adhering to Lenin's national policy, and are a new step prepared by the entire socialist construction process.

Khrushchev emphasized that the reorganization of industrial and construction management forms requires the reorganization of trade unions and the fundamental improvement of trade union work.

Khrushchev emphasized that when reorganizing the leadership of industry and construction, it should be constantly remembered that in order to promote the rapid upsurge of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's welfare, it is necessary to implement the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Only with the comprehensive and highly developed heavy industry can we create the necessary conditions for the development of light industry and various sectors of agriculture. Without the further upsurge of heavy industry, we cannot successfully solve the main economic task that the Party re-emphasized at the 20th National Congress - to catch up with and surpass the highly developed capitalist countries in the production of industrial products per capita in the shortest historical period.

When talking about foreign reactions to the Soviet plan to improve industrial and construction management, Khrushchev pointed out that the newspapers of the socialist camp and the progressive newspapers of capitalist countries believe that this plan is a new stage in the further development of the Soviet socialist economy and a sign of the superiority of the socialist economic system. Some remarks also appeared in the bourgeois newspapers, attempting to force the proposed measures in the Soviet Union into the crisis of the Soviet planned economic system. Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet economy has not experienced a crisis, nor will it experience a crisis, because it is a socialist planned economy, which does not have the kind of antagonistic contradictions that lead the capitalist economy to collapse.

    苏联全民讨论给予政府大力支持
    赫鲁晓夫建议马上着手改组工业管理
    将从中央各部管理国民经济过渡到分区管理
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫7日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上作了关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的报告。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在这次会议筹备期间，对这个问题的讨论是真正具有全民性质的。从3月30日到5月4日，全国各地组织了有四千零八十二万名劳动者参加的五十一万四千次会议，其中有二百三十多万人对改进工业和建设的领导工作提出了意见和建议。中央和地方的报刊广泛地报道了对这个问题的讨论。有六万八千多人在报纸上发表了自己的建议、意见和补充。
    苏联人民一致热烈支持关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的措施
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次讨论是苏维埃民主的又一次鲜明的表现。它令人信服地证实了：苏联不是口头上而是在实际行动上保证千百万劳动群众最广泛地参加决定国民经济发展的根本问题。对如此重要的问题进行全民讨论，是实现列宁集体领导原则和领导与人民紧密联系的具体范例，领导与人民的密切联系就是指党和政府在研究共产主义建设中的紧要任务时同人民商量，人民的集体智慧可以帮助找到最正确的解决办法。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联人民一致热烈支持党和政府提出的关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的措施，他们认为，这些措施十分及时，符合列宁主义的社会主义经济管理原则。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，讨论中提出了许多宝贵的建议，建议在考虑到各个经济地区和国民经济各个部门的具体条件和特征的情况下如何更好地组织管理工业和建设的工作。讨论中提出了许多正确的批评，揭露了各部和主管机关、计划机关、苏维埃、党和工会组织工作中的严重缺点。提了这些建议和批评，就使我们能更完善地、更灵活地来领导经济建设工作，同时有助于把越来越多的成千上万的有才能的组织工作者和专门人材提拔到经济建设各部门的岗位上来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在苏维埃政权的年代里积累下的发展国民经济的经验，证实了列宁主义的管理社会主义建设的原则有着伟大的生命力。远在苏维埃政权建立之初，列宁就说过，民主集中制的原则应该成为社会主义经济的基本原则，因为它能够使国家对经济的集中领导与高度发挥劳动群众的创造积极性正确结合起来。真正民主意义的集中要有一个历史上首创的前提，即不仅要完全无限制地发展地方的特点，而且要完全无限制地发展地方的首创精神和主动性，要有达到共同目标的各种方式、方法和手段。
    工业发展迅速，建设规模宏大，有必要进一步改进管理的形式和方法
    赫鲁晓夫说，为什么要改组管理机构呢？我们的工业很不错，有着很大的成就。这是无可争辩的。但是，正是因为工业发展极其迅速、建设规模空前宏大，才有必要进一步改进管理的形式和方法。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，我们所计划实行的改组工业和建设管理机构的工作，有助于克服我们现在所发现的许多缺点，能使领导接近生产，能更有效地同官僚主义进行斗争。但是，改组工作本身并不能消灭官僚主义，因为官僚主义者不会从地面上消失。因此不要松懈，而要加倍努力反对形形色色的官僚主义现象。广大的劳动群众和我们所有的社会组织越是投身到这一重大的工作中去，这个斗争就越顺利。
    赫鲁晓夫说，发展到现阶段的国民经济要求得到进一步的高涨，就必须把有效领导工业和建设的重心移到地方上去，使其接近企业和建筑工地。要做到这一点，只有从各部和主管机关管理国民经济的形式过渡到分区管理的形式。
    改组管理的工作必须在今年五、六月里进行，并且应该在过渡时期避免造成混乱
    赫鲁晓夫宣布，关于成立各国民经济委员会的建议，关于撤消或改组全苏和加盟共和国现有各工业部、各建造部和主管机关的建议将提交苏联最高苏维埃会议审查。
    赫鲁晓夫说，对于各工业部和建造部，建议保留下列全联盟性的部：航空工业部、造船工业部、无线电工业部、化学工业部、中型机器制造工业部和运输建设部。并且建议国防工业部同普通机器制造部合并，电站部同电站建设部合并。但是，这些部必须根本改组。它们必须摆脱直接管理相应企业的工作，只保留对企业的计划和整个技术领导的职权。采煤工业和石油工业以及钢铁工业和有色冶金工业这些部门，没有必要设立全联盟的部，因为它们的企业主要分布在俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰共和国、哈萨克共和国和阿塞拜疆共和国。建立共和国的部是适宜的，可以在俄罗斯联邦建立钢铁工业部、有色冶金工业部和采煤工业部，在乌克兰共和国建立钢铁工业部和采煤工业部，在俄罗斯联邦和阿塞拜疆共和国建立石油工业部。共和国的部设立在靠近生产的地方更为适宜。
    保留下来的各部的工业企业和建筑工地和被取消的各部的工业企业和建筑工地一样，将转交给国民经济委员会管理，国民经济委员会将通过相应的地区管理机构来实现对这些企业的直接领导。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，改组管理的工作不应当拖延，这项工作必须要在今年5、6月里进行。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，许多边疆区和州具有高度发达的工业，本身就构成相当庞大的经济区域，各加盟共和国就更不用说了。但是不一定要在每个州都建立国民经济委员会。在某些地方，似乎宜于几个州联合起来搞。但是现在不应该热衷于这一点，以免在向新的管理形式过渡时期造成混乱。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次会议上提出了一份经济行政区域表册，供大家研究。他说，打算成立九十二个国民经济委员会，其中俄罗斯联邦有六十八个，乌克兰共和国十一个，其他各加盟共和国各一个。
    现在的工业划分为全联盟、加盟共和国、共和国和地方的工业，今后必须改为两种隶属形式：归国民经济委员会管理的加盟共和国工业和直接属于劳动人民代表苏维埃的地方工业。
    在讨论提纲的时候，一些同志建议国民经济委员会应隶属于边疆区和州劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会。赫鲁晓夫认为这一点在目前是不适宜的。
    发展工业的专业化和协作、加强计划工作将有助于发挥国民经济中的雄厚潜力
    赫鲁晓夫特别谈到了发展工业的专业化和协作的问题。他指出，生产的协作化现在特别具有部门内部的性质，它还是远不完善的。各部的企业之间按经济地区进行的生产协作实际上实行得很差，当然，这就阻碍了最充分地利用各企业的生产能力。许多部的工作人员都害怕专业化和广泛的协作，因为这牵联到对已经确立了的生产组织形式进行某些变革。他们企图原封不动地保持现有工厂里的一切，按照老一套的方式工作。
    随着建立经济区和组织国民经济委员会，随着取消许多专业部和局，我们很快就会有可能在最广大的范围内实行生产的专业化和协作。通过国民经济委员会合理地组织生产的专业化和协作将有助于更充分地发挥国民经济中现有的雄厚潜力。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到计划工作问题，他强调指出，党和政府特别重视进一步加强国民经济发展的计划基础。苏联国家计划委员会应当成为苏联国民经济的、科学的经济计划机关。它的任务是深入地和全面地研究国民经济的需求，整理科学和技术上的成就，并且在这个基础上制定发展国民经济各部门的建议（建议中必须缜密地考虑综合发展经济的可能性）和根据全国利益合理地利用资源。在新的情况下，国民经济计划应当从加盟共和国和经济行政区着眼进行编制。苏联国家计划委员会应当保证苏联国民经济各部门正确的按比例的发展，并且以这种立场来检查各个加盟共和国和区的计划。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出必须大大改进远景计划工作。除了年度计划和五年计划之外，国家计划委员会还应制定全国性的和各部门的为期更长的远景计划。
    在制定国民经济计划时，必须尽量地考虑地方经验。因此制定计划应从各企业开始，而后由经济联合企业、国民经济委员会和共和国国家计划委员会依次进行，最后由苏联国家计划委员会制定。
    改组管理形式有巨大的经济和政治意义，这是苏联社会主义经济进一步发展的新阶段
    赫鲁晓夫说，改组工业和建设的管理形式，对于进一步扩大加盟共和国的权利和领导经济建设，都有巨大的意义。除了巨大的经济意义外，所拟定的措施还有极其重要的政治意义，因为这些措施标志着在奉行列宁的民族政策中新的一大步，是整个社会主义建设过程准备好的新的一大步。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，改组工业和建设的管理形式要求改组工会和根本上改进工会的工作。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，在改组工业和建设的领导的时候，应该经常记住，为了国民经济的迅速高涨和人民福利的不断提高，必须贯彻执行优先发展重工业的方针。只有在重工业全面和高度发展的情况下，才能给轻工业和农业各个部门的发展创造必需的条件。没有重工业的进一步高涨，我们就不可能顺利解决党在二十次代表大会的决议中再一次特别强调的主要经济任务——在最短的历史时期内、在按人口平均的工业产品的生产上赶上并超过高度发展的资本主义国家的任务。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到国外对苏联改进工业和建设管理工作计划的反应时指出，社会主义阵营的报纸和资本主义国家的进步报纸认为，这种计划是苏联社会主义经济进一步发展的新阶段，是社会主义经济体系优越性的标志。资产阶级报刊上也出现了一些言论，企图把苏联所拟定的措施硬说成是苏联的计划经济制度发生了危机。赫鲁晓夫就这点指出，苏联经济没有发生过危机，也不会发生危机，因为它是社会主义计划经济，这种经济没有像使资本主义经济走向崩溃的那种对抗性的矛盾。
