Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 30th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos warned at a press conference here on the 29th that militarism has been revived in West Germany. Its danger is no less than that of the Hitler era. He said: "We and the comrades of the German Socialist Unity Party are in complete agreement on this situation."

In this regard, Duclos pointed out that Adenauer has inherited Hitler's mantle, banned the German Communist Party, is now demanding the equipment and manufacture of atomic weapons, and has reinstated the Nazi general Speidel. West German militarists are gradually becoming rampant.

Duclos also pointed out that West Germany's practice of re-establishing military hegemony in Europe is parallel to its struggle for economic hegemony. As a result of the "free flow of capital" under the "Common Market" treaty of Little Europe, West German capital will flow into various small countries, thereby creating greater capital concentration in Western Europe. This treaty is also an anti-worker alliance established between capitalists of various countries. Therefore, the French Communist Party firmly opposes the "Common Market" treaty. He said: "We call on the working class to act in unison, and especially to issue this call to the Social Democrats."

### 杜克洛发出警告  军国主义已在西德复活

    杜克洛发出警告
    军国主义已在西德复活
    据新华社柏林30日电　法国共产党书记杜克洛29日在这里举行的记者招待会上警告说：军国主义已经在西德复活。它的危险性并不下于希特勒时代。他说：“对于这种情况我们和德国统一社会党的同志们的看法是完全一致的。”
    在这方面，杜克洛指出，阿登纳继承了希特勒的衣钵，禁止了德国共产党，现在又要求装备和制造原子武器，并且重新起用了纳粹将军斯派达尔。西德军国主义者正在逐步地飞扬跋扈起来。
    杜克洛还指出，西德在欧洲重新攫取军事霸权的做法是同它的争夺经济霸权相并行的。按照小欧洲“共同市场”条约实行“资本自由流通”的结果，西德资本将流入各小国，从而造成西欧更大的资本集中。这个条约又是各国资本家之间建立的反工人联盟。因此，法国共产党坚决反对“共同市场”条约。他说：“我们号召工人阶级一致行动，特别要向社会党人发出这种号召。”
