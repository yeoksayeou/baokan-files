Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Ministry of Geology has more than 26,000 surplus personnel this year. These people include skilled workers, on-the-job cadres, and cadre school students awaiting job assignments. This year, the Ministry of Geology will organize a group of skilled workers to do the work of temporary workers. In the past, temporary workers were needed during drilling operations to mix, carry, and lift mud and load and lift core samples. This year, it is planned to equip each drilling rig with more skilled workers, who will take turns doing these relatively rough tasks. In this way, on the one hand, workers can avoid being idle, and on the other hand, workers will not waste their skills.

This year, the Ministry of Geology also plans to organize a group of workers with lower skills to learn a second skill at work. In addition, in areas with better mining conditions, a portion of employees will be organized to mine ore, provided that it does not compete with local interests and does not damage underground resources.

Cadre school students who were originally scheduled to be assigned work this year will either apply to secondary-level geological technical schools and schools in other departments, or they will concentrate on studying to improve their professional level.

    技术工人做粗活
    据新华社3日讯　地质部今年多余两万六千多人。这些人包括技术工人、在职干部和待分配工作的干部学校的学生。地质部今年将组织一批技术工人做临时工人的工作。过去，在钻机工作期间，要有临时工人搅拌、挑抬泥浆和装抬岩心等，今年计划每台钻机多配备技术工人，由技术工人轮流做这些比较粗的工作。这样，一方面可以避免工人窝工，另方面又不会使工人荒废自己的技术。
    地质部今年还计划组织一批技术较低的工人在工作中学习第二种技术。另外，在开采条件较好的地区，在不与地方争利和不破坏地下资源的条件下，组织一部分职工开采矿石。
    原计划今年分配工作的干部学校的学生，有的将投考中等地质技术学校和其他部门的学校，有的将集中学习，以便提高业务水平。
