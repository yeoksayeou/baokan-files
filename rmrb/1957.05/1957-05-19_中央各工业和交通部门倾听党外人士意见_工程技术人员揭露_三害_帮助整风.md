Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: Recently, the CCP party organizations in the central industrial and transportation departments are inviting non-Party engineering and technical personnel to criticize the leadership work of the departments through symposiums and other methods, exposing errors of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism to help the Party carry out rectification.

**Unstable Technical Policies, Difficulty in Utilizing Technical Strength**

Many engineering and technical personnel pointed out in their speeches that while the state is carrying out large-scale industrial construction, it is entirely timely and necessary to set up scientific research and technical leadership institutions for various industries, and to transfer and concentrate technical personnel from all aspects to engage in industrial construction and industrial science and technology research. However, there are currently too many scientific research and technical leadership institutions set up, and they are too large. In particular, because the development plans and technical development directions of many industries have not been determined for a long time, and even those that have been determined are frequently changed, many institutions that have already been set up are in a state of unclear direction, and it is difficult to fully utilize technical strength. Some technical personnel of the First Ministry of Machine Building criticized the ministry's leadership for deciding to establish three scientific research institutes for machinery, tools, and technology without careful discussion and research. After these institutions were established, due to the unclear research direction and the small number of research topics, the gathered technical personnel were at a loss. Some technical personnel of the Railway Science Research Institute pointed out that the long-term and current research directions of the Science Research Institute have not been confirmed until now, so a large number of technical personnel have little work to do, and even individual plans for scientific and technological research are difficult to formulate due to the lack of direction.

**Insufficient Coordination, "Passing the Buck" in Collaboration**

Many engineering and technical personnel hope that the government and relevant departments will determine the development plans and technical development policies of various industries as soon as possible, and tell these plans and policies to the relevant engineering and technical personnel, so as to enable them to contribute their technical talents more consciously.

Many engineering and technical personnel pointed out that at present, many scientific research and industrial technology departments lack contact with each other, lack coordination and cooperation, and have overlapping work content, which not only affects the full utilization of technical strength, but also causes losses to industrial construction. For example, some research units study and promote the use of dry hard concrete without communication, resulting in a waste of research resources. Some technical personnel also pointed out that at present, there is a bad trend in the cooperation and coordination of many scientific research and technical work departments, that is, when carrying out a work together, they are afraid of suffering losses, and often get entangled in unprincipled disputes and "passing the buck."

**Setting Up Stalls and Seeking Formality, Unwilling to Go Deep into Reality**

Engineering and technical personnel from many departments cited many specific examples to criticize the leading cadres of the competent departments for neglecting technical leadership, and exposed the bureaucratic and subjective errors of the leading personnel in leading scientific and technological work. Some technical personnel of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry said that the ministry still does not have a special organization to manage design work. The ministry's Design Appraisal Division only manages design appraisal, and the Capital Construction Division only manages administration. When problems occur in design work, they don't know who to turn to for solutions. Some technical personnel of the Railway Science Research Institute said that the main leading cadres of the ministry rarely manage the work of the Academy of Sciences, and even the discussion of major technical issues is rarely attended by the main leading cadres of the ministry. Some technical personnel pointed out that many Party responsible cadres who lead scientific and technological work like to set up stalls and pursue the form of work, but are unwilling to go deep into reality to study and solve specific technical problems.

**Leadership of Technology Often Uses Administrative Means**

Many engineering and technical personnel also criticized some Party responsible cadres for not understanding the complexity of technical work, leading technical work or solving technical problems, often using simple administrative means, and sometimes even replacing technical conclusions with policies, and treating disputes on technical issues with a vote. An engineer from the Ministry of Food Industry pointed out that in 1955, the ministry stipulated that the methanol content of white wine should not exceed 4%, and some people suggested that the standard was too high and unrealistic, but the leadership did not listen to this opinion, so that the factory could not meet the standard and was forced to stop production. An engineer from the Sugar Bureau of this ministry said that some advanced experiences in the past were not very mature in theory and practice, because the leadership did not give technical personnel more convenient conditions for research, and often adopted an attitude of eagerness for success, using administrative orders to promote it, so many difficulties occurred in the implementation. Many technical personnel believe that in order to improve the level of industrial technology in our country faster and give full play to the talents of technical personnel, the leading personnel of the competent departments must manage and lead technical work in accordance with the characteristics of technical work and technical personnel.

**Some Non-Party Technical Personnel Have Titles but No Power**

Non-Party engineering and technical personnel in various industrial departments have made the most criticisms to the leadership of the departments for their inability to rationally use their technical talents. Some senior engineering and technical personnel who hold technical leadership positions believe that because they are often in a position of having a title but no power, they are cautious in their work and their enthusiasm is restricted. Xuan Guifen, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Paper Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, cited an example, saying that he was once designated to convene a meeting to study wage issues. Halfway through the meeting, the deputy director arrived and overturned all the opinions that had been discussed, which made him feel extremely embarrassed at the time. Even the meetings he chaired to deal with daily work, even if resolutions were made, could not be implemented in some departments due to lack of support.

Many engineering and technical personnel who are engaged in general technical work reflect that the Party organizations and administrative leaders of their departments often emphasize political conditions when assigning work, but rarely care about and help them improve their political and ideological level; some emphasize the importance of technical work, but dare not boldly use them. An engineer from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry analyzed the reason why the thinking of design personnel lags behind reality, saying that the leadership does not allow the design personnel to understand the position of what they design in the national economy, often emphasizes confidentiality, and does not allow the design personnel to understand the overall situation, but requires them to consider the problem comprehensively. This is difficult. How can one be comprehensive if one only understands one side?

**Many Departments Waste Technical Strength**

Many engineering and technical personnel also exposed the phenomenon of accumulation and waste of technical strength in many departments. They pointed out that in the past, some departments blindly searched for and gathered a large number of technical personnel before the work tasks and work scope were determined, and many engineering and technical personnel had nothing to do; some units had many technical talents who were not needed in their work, and they would rather accumulate them than transfer them to units that needed these talents. Many engineering and technical personnel hope that the government will uniformly investigate various categories of technical talents, plan and allocate and use technical strength, and transfer many technical personnel accumulated at the upper levels to enterprises that directly produce.

**Technical Research is Subject to Many Restrictions**

The engineering and technical personnel of these departments also cited many examples to illustrate the various difficulties they encountered in their scientific and technological work. They pointed out that the current confidentiality system in many departments is too strict and rigid, and the implementation of the confidentiality system is extremely unreasonable, which not only hinders the learning and improvement of technical personnel, but also seriously affects the work. Some designers said that design work is a creative labor, which requires not only accumulating rich knowledge, but also studying the materials of various practical work, but at present it is extremely difficult to collect scientific and technological data, and many departments keep all data confidential without distinction, and they also encounter various restrictions when collecting data in factories and mines. Because design personnel cannot obtain a large amount of data for research, the quality of design cannot be guaranteed. Some technical personnel pointed out that many leading departments and leading cadres do not understand the characteristics of scientific research and technical work, and sometimes not only do not encourage technical personnel to go deep into the front line to combine technical theory with practice, but also set out clear rules and regulations to restrict technical personnel from going deep into reality. They hope that the competent departments should attach importance to the learning and improvement of technical personnel and give them more convenient conditions for technical research.

    中央各工业和交通部门倾听党外人士意见
    工程技术人员揭露“三害”帮助整风
    据新华社18日讯　最近中央各工业和交通部门的中共党组织，正在通过召开座谈会等方式，邀请非党的工程技术人员，对部的领导工作提出批评意见，揭发官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的错误，帮助党进行整风。技术政策摇摆不定，技术力量难以发挥
    许多工程技术人员在发言中指出，国家在进行大规模工业建设的同时，相应地设置各类工业的科学研究和领导技术工作的机构，并且抽调和集中各个方面的技术人员，从事工业建设和工业科学技术的研究工作，是完全适时的和必要的。但目前设置的科学研究和领导技术工作的机构过多，过于庞大，特别是由于许多工业的发展规划和技术发展方向，长期不能确定下来，即使确定了的也是经常变更，这样就使得已经设置起来的许多机构，长期处于方向不明，技术力量难以充分发挥。第一机械工业部的一些技术人员，批评部的领导上没有经过慎重的讨论研究，就决定建立机械、工具和工艺等三个科学研究院。这些机构建立后，由于研究的方针不明确，研究的题目很少，调集来的技术人员彷徨无策。铁道科学研究院的一些技术人员，指出这个科学研究院长远的和当前的研究方向，直到现在还没有肯定下来，因而大批技术人员平时工作很少，甚至个人研究科学技术的规划，也因缺少方向而难以制定。
    配合不够，在协作中互相“扯皮”
    许多工程技术人员，希望政府和各有关的部门，及早确定各类工业的发展规划和技术发展的政策，并且把这些规划和政策告诉有关的工程技术人员，以便使他们更自觉地贡献自己的技术才能。
    许多工程技术人员指出，目前许多科学研究和工业技术部门，相互之间缺乏联系，协作配合不够，工作内容重复，不仅影响到技术力量的充分发挥，而且使工业建设受到损失。例如，有些研究单位研究推广使用干硬性混凝土互不通气，造成研究力量的浪费。有些技术人员还指出，目前许多科学研究和技术工作部门，在协作配合中滋长着一种不良的倾向，即是在共同进行一项工作时，唯恐自己吃亏，常常纠缠在无原则的争论和“扯皮”中。
    摆摊子求形式，不肯深入实际
    许多部门的工程技术人员，列举出许多具体事例，批评主管部门的领导干部忽视技术领导，并且揭发了领导人员在领导科学技术工作中官僚主义和主观主义的错误。电力工业部的一些技术人员说，部里至今还没有专门的机构管理设计工作，部的设计鉴定司只管设计鉴定，基本建设司只管行政，设计工作中发生了问题，不知找谁去解决。铁道科学研究院的一些技术人员说，部的主要领导干部，很少管科学院的工作，甚至重大技术问题的讨论，部的主要领导干部也很少参加。有些技术人员指出，许多领导科学技术工作的党员负责干部，喜欢摆摊子，追求工作的形式，却不肯深入实际，研究和解决技术方面的具体问题。
    领导技术往往用行政手段
    不少工程技术人员还批评有些党员负责干部，不了解技术工作的复杂性，领导技术工作或解决技术问题，往往运用简单的行政手段，甚至有时以政策代替技术结论，以表决的方式对待技术问题上的争论。食品工业部一位工程师指出，1955年部规定白酒含甲醇量不得超过4％，当时有人提出标准过高，不切实际，可是领导上不听取这个意见，以致工厂达不到这个标准，被迫停产。这个部制糖局一位工程师说，过去有些先进经验，并不都是在理论上和作法上很成熟，这是因为领导上没有给技术人员较多的便利条件去研究，往往采取急于求成的态度，用行政命令去推广，因此执行中发生不少困难。许多技术人员认为，要想更快地提高我国工业技术的水平，充分发挥技术人员的才能，主管部门的领导人员必须按照技术工作和技术人员的特点，来管理和领导技术工作。
    有的非党技术人员有职无权
    各工业部门的非党工程技术人员，对于不能合理地使用他们的技术才能，向部的领导上提出的批评意见最多。有些担任技术领导职务的高级工程技术人员认为，由于他们经常处在有职无权的地位，工作中缩手缩脚，积极性受到限制。轻工业部造纸设计院副总工程师宣桂芬举例说，有一次指定由他召集一次会议研究工资问题，会议开了一半，副院长一到会把已经讨论的意见全部推翻，当时使他感到极为难。就是由他主持召开的处理日常工作的会议，纵然作了决议，由于得不到支持，在有些科室也贯彻不下去。
    许多担任一般技术工作的工程技术人员，反映他们部门的党组织和行政领导上，分配工作时常常强调政治条件，而平时又很少关心和帮助他们提高政治思想水平；有的强调技术工作重要，却又不敢大胆放手地使用他们。冶金工业部一位工程师分析设计人员思想落后于实际的原因说，领导上不让设计人员了解他们所设计的东西在国民经济中所占的地位，常常强调保密，不让设计人员了解全面情况，而又要求他们全面考虑问题。这就难了，了解片面，怎能全面？
    许多部门浪费技术力量
    许多工程技术人员，还揭发了许多部门积压和浪费技术力量的现象。他们指出，过去有些部门，工作任务和工作范围还没有确定，就盲目地搜罗和聚集大批技术人员，许多工程技术人员无事可作；有些单位，有许多本来在工作上不需要的技术人才，他们宁愿积压起来，也不肯调给那些需要这些人才的单位去。许多工程技术人员，希望政府统一调查各种类别的技术人才，有计划地调配和使用技术力量，把积压在上层的许多技术人员，下放到直接生产的企业中去。
    技术研究受到很多限制
    这些部门的工程技术人员们，还举出许多事例，说明他们在进行科学技术工作中遇到的种种困难。他们提出，目前许多部门的保密制度规定的过严过死，保密制度的执行也极不合理，不仅妨碍了技术人员的学习和提高，还严重地影响了工作。有些设计人员说，设计工作本是一项创造性的劳动，既需要积累丰富的知识，也要钻研各项实际工作的材料，但目前搜集科学技术资料极为困难，许多部门对一切资料毫无区别地保密，下厂下矿搜集资料也遇到种种限制。由于设计人员得不到大量的资料进行研究，设计质量也就无法保证。有些技术人员指出，不少领导部门和领导干部，不大了解科学研究和技术工作的特点，有时不仅不去鼓励技术人员深入现场，使技术理论和实际结合起来，反而订出条条清规戒律，限制技术人员深入实际。他们希望，主管部门应该重视技术人员的学习和提高，更多地给予他们进行技术研究的便利条件。
