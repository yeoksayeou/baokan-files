    Promoting Further Understanding and Closeness Between the Polish and Chinese People
    Preparatory Committee for Polish-Chinese Friendship Association Established
    Warsaw dispatch from our newspaper, May 22nd: The secretariat of the preparatory committee for the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association has been established in Warsaw. The main tasks of the preparatory stage are to draft the charter, prepare for a general meeting to adopt the charter, and formally establish the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association.
    It is understood that the initial idea for establishing the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association came from the readers of "People's Tribune," the central organ of the Polish United Workers' Party. Many readers wrote to the "People's Tribune" editorial department proposing this initiative. A letter written in the name of a group of comrades from the Warsaw Industrial Building Standard Design and Research Bureau, after mentioning the increasing contacts between Poland and China in economic and cultural fields, stated: "There is currently no mass social organization that can serve the purpose of further understanding and closeness between the two peoples. This cannot be achieved through government channels. Therefore, we suggest establishing the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association as soon as possible. We are willing to actively participate in the preparatory work of this association." The letter was signed by engineer Kabe Linski. Under the initiative of the readers, with the enthusiastic support of the Polish United Workers' Party and various social organizations, and under the organization of the "People's Tribune," the preparatory committee for the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association was born.

    促进波中人民进一步的了解和接近
    波中友协筹委会成立
    本报华沙22日电　波中友协筹备委员会书记处已经在华沙成立了。目前筹备阶段的主要工作是起草章程，准备开大会通过章程并正式成立波中友协。
    据了解，成立波中友协的最先创议者是波兰统一工人党中央机关报“人民论坛报”的读者。不少读者写信给“人民论坛报”编辑部，提出这个倡议。一封以华沙工业建筑标准设计和研究局一批同志的名义写的信中，在提到波中两国的来往、经济和文化方面的日渐增多的接触后，写道：“现在还没有群众性的社会团体，这种团体能够服务于两国人民进一步了解和接近的目的。这是通过政府的途径所不能达到的。因此，我们建议尽快地建立波中友协。我们愿意积极参加这个协会的筹备工作。”这封信是由工程师卡贝林斯基签名的。在读者的首创下，在波兰统一工人党和各社会团体的热烈支持下，在“人民论坛报”的组织下，波中友协筹委会就诞生了。
