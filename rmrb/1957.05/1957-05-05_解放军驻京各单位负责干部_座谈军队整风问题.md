Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd—The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army convened a meeting today of responsible cadres from units stationed in Beijing to discuss launching a rectification movement within the army.

    Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, pointed out at the meeting that in this new historical period, the various contradictions within the army are mainly manifested in the relationships between officers and soldiers, between the General Headquarters of the PLA and the troops, and between the army and the people. The focus of the rectification should be on leadership cadres at the regiment level and above. Each unit must specifically analyze the ideological trends of the cadres and determine the key areas of rectification.

    General Xiao Hua also pointed out that the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" must be implemented in the army. He said that although the army has the characteristics of centralization and unity, this does not hinder "letting go" and "contending." On the contrary, precisely because the army is centralized and unified, it should "let go" and "contend" boldly. According to the historical experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the more democracy is promoted, the more soldiers will obey orders, and the more leadership will be strengthened. He also criticized the erroneous practices of some leading cadres and cultural work departments in the past who interfered with literary and artistic creation using simple and crude methods.

    During the discussion, the responsible cadres of the troops stationed in Beijing unanimously agreed that it is very necessary to carry out a rectification movement in the army. They also expressed warm support for the decision of senior cadres to participate in physical labor. The meeting studied the main contradictions within the army and their specific manifestations, and also conducted a full discussion on the methods and steps of rectification.

    After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the rectification movement, the General Political Department convened a meeting on April 30 to discuss the issue of carrying out the rectification movement in the army.

    解放军驻京各单位负责干部
    座谈军队整风问题
    新华社3日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部今天召集驻北京各单位负责干部举行座谈会，讨论在军队中开展整风运动问题。
    总政治部副主任萧华上将在座谈会上指出，在新的历史时期中，军队内部的各种矛盾，主要表现在官兵之间，解放军各总部同部队之间，以及军队和人民之间的关系方面。整风的重点应该是团以上领导干部。各单位必须具体分析干部的思想动态，确定整风重点。
    萧华上将还指出，在军队中必须贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。他说，军队虽然具有集中统一的特点，但这并不妨碍“放”和“鸣”，而且正由于军队集中统一，更应该大胆地“放”，大胆地“鸣”。根据中国人民解放军的历史经验，发扬了民主，士兵更会听指挥，领导也更为加强。他还对过去军队的若干领导干部和文化工作部门用简单、粗暴的方法干涉文艺创作的错误做法提出了批评。
    在讨论中，驻北京各部队的负责干部一致认为，在军队中开展整风运动是十分必要的。对高级干部参加体力劳动的决定也都表示热烈拥护。会议研究了军队内部有那些主要矛盾及其具体表现，还对整风的方法、步骤等展开了充分讨论。
    总政治部在中共中央发出关于整风运动的指示以后，4月30日就开会讨论了在军队中开展整风运动问题。
