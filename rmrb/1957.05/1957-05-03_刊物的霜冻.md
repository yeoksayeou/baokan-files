    Frost on Publications
    Zigang
    In our lives, we often describe things that start out intense but then fizzle out as "much thunder, little rain." But conversely, are there things that are "little thunder, much rain"?
    I say there are. Let me give an example.
    In our compound, there are the offices of three magazines: "Middle School Student," "Rural Youth," and "Traveler." These days, the editors are also suffering from the whims of the early spring weather, just like the farmers: fearing spring snow, fearing frost; we fear the sharp decline in magazine circulation. April is the beginning of the second quarter and also the beginning of saving paper and controlling circulation. But who would have known that it was also the beginning of a sharp decline in circulation. The publishing authorities' decision to control circulation was originally just to avoid exceeding last year's total circulation, and not to greatly shrink circulation.
    But what's happening now? A message before printing: "Middle School Student" has fallen by 40,000 to 50,000; another message: "Rural Youth" has fallen by 40,000 to 50,000; and yet another message: "Traveler" has fallen by more than 20,000...
    These messages leave us speechless and dumbfounded. The thunder wasn't loud, but the rain is heavy. The editor-in-chief of "Middle School Student" said: "Let's not get emotional. In the past, how much a publication sold was an indicator of how good it was edited, but now, it's not necessarily the case...". What he said makes some sense; finding internal reasons is really difficult. "Middle School Student" has recently been edited in a lively and engaging way. With the hot topic of middle school graduates participating in labor production, sales should be rising. "Rural Youth" is also facing the spring plowing season and the theme of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. The content and printing of "Traveler" are also striving for improvement. What's more, with the warmth of spring and blooming flowers, it should be its peak sales season, but now it has fallen by more than 20,000. Such volatility has never happened before.
    Upon further inquiry, it's not just our compound that has suffered frost. It turns out that "China Youth" has also fallen by 200,000. "People's Literature" also fell by 60,000 from a base of more than 190,000, so the April issue didn't even print the circulation figures on the publication.
    Recently, many magazine editorial departments have received letters from readers complaining that they cannot subscribe to magazines. Some long-term subscribers can no longer subscribe, breaking their habit of preserving complete sets of a certain publication from beginning to end. The "China Youth Daily" on April 9 also published a reader's letter saying that they could not subscribe to the newspapers and magazines they wanted on the construction site in Lanzhou. He advocated that they should be treated differently, so that people on construction sites would not lack spiritual food.
    This situation should be said to be worthy of attention. It is right for us to save paper, but in implementing the measures, we lacked careful consideration. Therefore, the goal achieved is not that each publication does not exceed last year's total circulation, but rather a sudden and drastic drop, as if a cultural low tide has arrived.
    Behind the decision to control circulation, orders from post offices and bookstores were sent to local areas: "Save paper, don't order more than before." In fact, the numbers "ordered" by various regions will always fluctuate. Usually there is some adjustment, so that it rises and falls slowly. But now, the places that want to increase can't increase, but the drop is arbitrary, so the result is naturally a universal decline.
    I can't help but think of the propaganda work conference held not long ago. In the publishing group, many people spoke out, pointing out how ridiculous and unreasonable it is that the circulation of books and periodicals is determined by the number "ordered" by post offices and bookstores. Between the editors and the layers of salespeople, who can better estimate the quality of books and periodicals and the readers' appetite for them? However, it is not the editors who are now deciding the fate of books and periodicals. The partial reason for overstocking and out-of-stock situations lies here.
    Therefore, in the publishing group of the conference, someone shouted: "Let the editors' petty subjectivism replace the salespeople's grand subjectivism," although it is difficult to completely avoid petty subjectivism. Regarding the sudden and drastic drop in circulation of various publications, how can we know that there isn't such a situation: that the people who "order" the number of publications overinterpreted the policy, thinking that the more they save, the more they complete the task.
    I support the idea that the circulation of books and periodicals should be controlled by the publishers and editors themselves. We should carefully study many ways to save paper, and then take measures to control the circulation of publications. We should also conduct a general study of the current quality and needs of various publications.
    The weather forecast has predicted that the climate will warm up. Old farmers even have methods to resist frost, and the frost period for publications should also pass quickly!

    刊物的霜冻
    子冈
    在我们生活里，常把某些先紧后松的事叫作雷声大雨点小，但是反过来说，雷声小雨点大的事有没有呢？
    我说是有的，这里且举一个例吧。
    在我们这个院子里，是三个杂志的办公室：中学生、农村青年、旅行家。这些天来，编辑同志们也像农民一样，受着早春天气的播弄：怕春雪啦，怕霜冻啦；我们怕的是刊物印数猛跌。4月份是第二季度的开始，又是为了节约纸张、控制印数的开始，却哪里晓得，也是印数猛跌的开始。出版当局控制印数的决定，原不过是想不超过去年的总印数，而并没想大大收缩印数。
    现在呢？付印前一个消息：中学生跌了四、五万；再一个消息：农村青年跌了四、五万，又一个消息：旅行家跌了两万多……
    这些消息使我们张目结舌，使我们无话可说。雷声不大，雨点却不小。中学生的主编说：别动感情吧，从前一个刊物销得多少，是一个刊物编得好坏的指标，如今呢，却未必……。他这话有些道理，找内在原因，实在不大。中学生最近编得生动活泼，中学毕业生参加劳动生产的热题目当前，销路应涨；农村青年也是面对春耕和勤俭办社的时际；旅行家的内容和印刷也正力求改进，更何况春暖花开、正应该是它的销行旺季，现在却一跌两万多，这样的波动从未有过。
    再一打听，并非仅仅我们一个院子里遭了霜冻，原来中国青年也一跌二十万。人民文学也在十九万多的基础上一跌六万，因此四月号都没往刊物上印印数。
    最近许多刊物编辑部接到读者来信，抱怨订不到刊物，有的老订户也订不到了，以致打破了他们自始至终保存一种全份刊物的习惯。4月9日“中国青年报”也刊登了一封读者来信，说在兰州工地上订不到想订的报刊，他主张应该分别对待，免得在建设工地上的人缺少精神食粮。
    这种情况应该说是值得注意的。我们节约纸张是应该的，但是在实行措施的时候欠思考，因此达到的目的不是每个刊物不超过去年的总印数，而是唏哩哗啦地猛跌，好像文化的低潮来了。
    在控制印数的决定后面，跟着是邮局和书店的命令发到地方上去：要节约纸张呀，别比以前多要。事实上是各地“要”的数字总会有此起彼落的情况，平时有个调剂，才缓涨缓跌。但是现在呢，想涨的地方涨不上去，跌却随意，结果自然普遍下跌。
    我不能不联想到不久以前举行的宣传工作会议来。在出版小组里，多少人曾经发言，指出书刊由邮局和书店“要”数目决定印数的可笑和不合理，究竟在编辑人和层层售货员之间，谁更估计得出书刊的质量和读者的消纳胃口呢？然而现在决定书刊命运的却不是编辑人。积压与脱销的部分原因在这里。
    因此在会议的出版小组里有人呐喊：让编辑人的小主观主义代替售货员的大主观主义吧，虽然很难全然避免小主观主义。对于各种刊物的突然大大跌落印数，焉知不有这样一种情况：“要”刊物数目的人体会政策过了头，以为越节约，越完成任务。
    我是拥护书刊印数应由出版者和编辑人自己掌握的。应该审慎研究许多节约用纸的办法，然后再采取手段控制刊物印数，也应该普遍研究一下目前各刊物的质量和需要。
    气候回暖，已由气象台预告。老农且有抗御霜冻的方法，刊物的霜冻期也应赶快过去才好！
