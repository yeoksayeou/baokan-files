Editor's Note: This is the full text of Bi Mingqi's speech. The title and subheadings were added by the editor.

I agree with Comrade Qian Jiaju's speech criticizing someone's statement "What is there to learn from the working class?" and the erroneous views on two-sidedness and the redemption policy. Qian is our teacher and has given us great help in the years of reform. I offer these differing opinions as an exchange.

He believes that the reason why some so-called negative thoughts and work styles of private personnel have not been criticized is mainly to help the Party's rectification campaign first.

On May 17, I published my views under the title "How the Working Class Views the National Bourgeoisie." This is how I personally see it, and it is also a reflection and requirement of some industrial and commercial masses that I have heard in my work. Even though some of these views may be too high and one-sided, we should affirm that the main thing is to demand rapid progress into socialism. The occurrence of these ideological contradictions is for the sake of rapidly entering socialist society. Reflecting it is very necessary and also a very crucial issue for correctly handling contradictions among the people. I believe that an important aspect of the poor relationship between the public and private sectors in some enterprises is that the public sector does not adequately understand the feelings of the private personnel and underestimates our desire for progress. My presentation of this ideological reflection starts from a positive point of view, aiming to make our industrial and commercial circles work and reform with peace of mind, and to enable the public sector to have a clear direction in ideological reform. Of course, when I spoke, there were shortcomings because I only mentioned giving due evaluation to the national bourgeoisie after the fundamental change in the relations of production (it should be stated that full evaluation has already been given through overall arrangements, assigning jobs according to ability, and appropriate care. For example, the saying that the national bourgeoisie is a wealth and not a burden is an evaluation given to us by the Party and the government based on the positive performance of private personnel after the overall joint state-private ownership, which is a great encouragement to private personnel. However, having positions and power, and being respected, is not enough), while simultaneously criticizing some of the so-called negative thoughts and work styles that still exist among private personnel in their work. Therefore, some comrades feel that my talk is one-sided. My view is to mainly help the Party in its rectification campaign, reflecting to the Party the three major evils of some Party members in their work, and not putting forward a self-criticism for our industrial and commercial circles themselves. After the Party's rectification movement is successfully completed soon, we will also ask the Party to strengthen education for us in order to improve the relationship between the public and private sectors and change the views of employees, and to give us a gentle breeze and light rain for a rectification campaign. The spirit of offering criticisms to some Party members this time is also what Chairman Mao taught: "Those who educate others must first be educated." We will first assist the Party in its rectification campaign and then educate ourselves.

After I presented the views of the working class on the national bourgeoisie, some comrades said that I had given the national bourgeoisie too high an evaluation. In particular, I did not analyze and criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the national bourgeoisie in the current stage in enterprises, which made it seem too high and inappropriate in comparison. In short, it gave me great enlightenment and help in terms of position, viewpoint, and method.

He believes that Qian Jiaju treats the individual and minority as comprehensive, which is not the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

I agree with Comrade Qian Jiaju's statement on the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and the correct understanding of the redemption policy. However, I disagree with him quoting what I said and not explaining it clearly, thereby labeling me. For example, he said that Comrade Bi Mingqi said, "It is not a simple matter for the national bourgeoisie to hand over their enterprises. The ideological struggle and ideological changes involved are not appreciated by many Party members." After quoting this statement, Comrade Qian Jiaju went on to say, "Indeed, it is after a difficult ideological struggle that the national bourgeoisie handed over their enterprises. This is clear evidence that they have accepted reform. Precisely because of this, we cannot imagine that after giving up their enterprises, especially when encountering some difficulties in their work, they no longer have a lingering sense of yearning for the old days. Isn't the so-called 'small kingdom before joint ownership, minister of a large country after joint ownership, and citizen of a conquered nation after the merger' a manifestation of this feeling?"

What we feel in practice is that after a hard-won victory, socialist ideology triumphs over capitalist ideology, and the main thing is to raise socialist consciousness and confidence in taking the socialist road. For example, since liberation, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, taxation work, public bonds, etc., have been important because of the education received. As for the doggerel we discovered written by a few individuals, "small kingdom before joint ownership, minister of a large country after joint ownership, and citizen of a conquered nation after the merger," we put forward in the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association to use this to conduct education, to be vigilant against the bourgeois ideology, and to strengthen ideological reform. We report to the Party without reservation on the situation we can understand in the industrial and commercial circles, whether it is the thinking of a few or the thinking of individuals, and ask the Party to better understand and strengthen our socialist transformation. Can it be said that this is not a concrete manifestation of our sincerely and honestly accepting socialism from the Party? We must not regard the individual or the minority as the general, and we must not regard the individual or the minority as the comprehensive. This method of analysis is not the spirit of seeking truth from facts in Marxism-Leninism.

He said, "It is more glorious for the national bourgeoisie to give up the means of production without any nostalgia than it is for the workers who have nothing," a statement I have neither said nor heard of.

I strongly disagree with Comrade Qian Jiaju's statement that "At the same time, we cannot agree that it is more glorious for the national bourgeoisie to give up the means of production without any nostalgia than it is for the workers who have nothing." Not only have I not said this, but it is not in my mind either, and I have not heard any national capitalists say it. Anyone with a little socialist thought understands that no matter what social system, labor creates the world. What is deeply rooted in our hearts is that since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class, the Chinese Communist Party, the working class has achieved great victories in socialist construction with their powerful hands and wisdom. Our understanding is that all the great creations in the world belong to the working class and belong to the working people. I don't know where Comrade Qian Jiaju's saying "more glorious than the workers who have nothing" came from. At the same time, it is better to take off this big hat if there is no one under it. The best way to educate people is to convince them with reason. Using pressure to solve problems will not solve the problem. Ideological reform does not rely on labeling. We must be made to recognize the future from the depths of our minds and wholeheartedly take the socialist road. We have deeply realized this from the eight years of socialist transformation.

Dogmatists say that the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce into overall joint state-private ownership is only due to external causes, and the external causes they understand are not the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but the "pressure". The conscious side of the national bourgeoisie who have accepted education, recognized the laws of development, and grasped their own destiny simply does not exist. For example, before the overall joint state-private ownership, joint state-private ownership was done household by household. We once suggested to the Party and the government that if it were done this way, it would take 10 to 20 years. Later, applications for developing industry and commerce were done in batches. At the executive committee meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at the end of 1955, we listened to Chairman Mao's teachings, recognized the laws of social development, recognized the future, and grasped our own destiny. Therefore, in the beginning of 1956, a nationwide upsurge was set off. This kind of upsurge cannot be created or formulated by anyone. The Party and the government did not prepare for an upsurge in advance. I believe that this upsurge is a combination of external and internal causes, and it is a natural development. Can it be said that such an upsurge should be said to be "relations of production must be adapted to the development of the productive forces, and backward modes of production must be replaced by advanced modes of production, and capitalism will inevitably be replaced by socialism? This is the law of social development. If our industrialists and businessmen do not recognize or admit this law, we will not be able to grasp our own destiny. Our changes cannot come to today either. Anyone who wants to deny that we already have progressive ideas and demands to take the socialist road is also violating the laws of social development (of course, it should be stated that this does not mean that the transformation of the national bourgeoisie is complete, even after the bourgeoisie is eliminated, the ideological transformation of the bourgeoisie is a long-term process)." No industrialist or businessman can deny this.

In my last speech, I said, "Under such a change in ideological transformation in our industrial and commercial circles, we are still labeled, saying that we are nostalgic for capitalism and are taking the road of regression, etc. Such education and transformation methods are not in line with reality." Our concept of being nostalgic for capitalism and taking the road of regression refers to "greed for the capitalist system, nostalgia for exploitation, engaging in underground factories, unwilling to engage in production in joint state-private ownership, and preferring to work independently, although this is a very small number, but it has been constantly discovered in industrial and commercial circles.

Comrade Qian Jiaju said, "The so-called capitalist side refers to the capitalist ideology, work style, work methods, etc. When we say that they are still nostalgic for capitalism, we are referring to the ideological situation, not that they still want to take the capitalist road." I very much agree with this explanation, and it has also relieved the ideological burden on the industrial and commercial circles. This is exactly what the masses of the industrial and commercial circles think about the capitalist side, and there has been a big difference in concepts in the past.

He believes that after the overall joint state-private ownership, the class contradiction has basically ended, and it is not convincing to simply say that class exists and two-sidedness exists without analysis. This dogmatic approach is not convincing.

Comrade Qian Jiaju said, "Regarding the question of whether the bourgeoisie's two-sidedness exists and how the two-sidedness should be explained, we should first ask whether the bourgeoisie has been completely eliminated today." I agree with the above statement. This is a key issue in solving ideology. After several years of ideological transformation education given to us by the Party and the government, our national bourgeoisie has mostly recognized that even if the bourgeoisie is eliminated, the ideological transformation of the bourgeoisie is still a long-term process. No one imagines that the bourgeois ideology will be eliminated before the class is eliminated. Where there is class, there is two-sidedness, and there are class relations. This is what most industrialists and businessmen understand, but the main problem is not here. We should recall what the class education work was like in the years before the overall joint state-private ownership? We said that the national bourgeoisie has two sides, the positive side being beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the negative side being the five poisons such as tax evasion and theft of state property. This impression is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Since the overall joint state-private ownership, the national bourgeoisie has handed over their enterprises, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the class contradiction has basically ended. Our class education still says that class still exists, class relations exist, and two-sidedness also exists, without analyzing to what extent the class is in the process of being eliminated? Are class relations the main thing in the enterprise? What is the degree of change in the two-sidedness? It is not convincing to simply say that class exists and two-sidedness exists without analysis using such a dogmatic approach. There may be two kinds of attitudes among industrialists and businessmen towards this issue: one is verbal agreement but internal disagreement, saying whatever you say, and the other is neither verbal agreement nor internal disagreement. Some even say that two-sidedness is gone, mainly meaning that the negative side is gone because there is no ownership of the means of production anymore. Why would they commit the five poisons! What they mean by gone is that the negative side of national capitalists holding the ownership of the means of production to carry out the five poisons is gone. If we make it clear that class exists and bourgeois ideology also exists, such as capitalist ideology, work style, work methods, etc., which belong to the scope of ideological transformation, I believe that the industrial and commercial circles will agree. Such a concept will make us more confident in accepting transformation.

Comrade Qian Jiaju said, "The bourgeoisie is in the process of being eliminated. It is not in line with the facts to think that it has been eliminated." He presented the following objective facts as proof, saying, "The fact is that the state still has to pay more than 100 million yuan in fixed interest every year, and the state has various arrangements and care for bourgeois elements in terms of life and politics. There are still contradictions and problems between public and private, and between workers and private personnel. These are all objective facts, not the product of anyone's subjectivity." I have great disagreements with the above explanation. I agree that class exists because of the existence of fixed interest and that the state has care for bourgeois elements in life because they are different from the general working people. As for various arrangements and care in politics, and the existence of contradictions and problems between public and private, and between workers and private personnel, and therefore proving that class exists, I disagree. Does that mean that all the arrangements and care for us after the overall joint state-private ownership are due to the existence of class, and will it all be washed away when class is eliminated? I express doubt? The fact is that the Party and the government will not do this.

Comrade Qian Jiaju also said, "After the overall joint state-private ownership, on the one hand, the capitalists hand over the means of production to the state and basically become state workers and state cadres. In this sense, they are already working people." The above statement seems to mean that class is eliminated. He then said, "But on the other hand, they are still different from the general working people. They take fixed interest and have various kinds of care in life (such as high salaries not being reduced, 50-70% of wages being paid during sick leave, etc.), thus retaining the identity of the bourgeoisie." I have different views on the above analysis. I have no objection to retaining the identity of the bourgeoisie because of taking fixed interest and high salaries. As for 50-70% of sick leave wages, because some private personnel are unfortunate enough to get sick and only receive 30% of their monthly salary, making it difficult to make a living, and they cannot enjoy any labor insurance benefits, they agreed to follow this sick leave wage method after reflection. Moreover, it has not yet been fully implemented. Even if it is implemented, it cannot be used as a reason to retain the identity of the bourgeoisie. In addition, there are quite a few people in the industrial and commercial circles who do not have fixed interest to take, and some of their wages are even lower than those of workers. Should these people be declared to be already members of the working class?

Finally, I would like to raise a question for everyone to explore together. Let us study it calmly and peacefully, without labeling and speaking the truth and reasoning. The policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce is a new creation in our country. There are no classic works to follow, and the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries have no experience to refer to.

He believes that the class contradiction has basically ended. Should the class also basically end? Why do we still cling to class relations and class two-sidedness unchanged?

After the overall joint state-private ownership, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the class contradiction has basically ended. The components of class existence should also change greatly because the contradiction has basically ended. Should the class also basically end, and should the class relations become very weak? It should be stated that whether class exists or will not exist in the future, ideological transformation is a long-term process. To what extent can the class be eliminated? Does that mean that it will be limited to the six years of fixed interest? Is this time long or short in light of social development? I always think that the time is quite long because we are now in a period of highly revolutionary change, and it is difficult to estimate. Is it appropriate to rigidly stipulate that there are still six years to conform to the laws of social development? Now, we are merely saying that there is fixed interest, so there is class. If there is class, there are class relations, and if there is class, there is two-sidedness. What is the standard for this progress? Is it measured by the ideological progress of people? Or is it necessary to stipulate that there are still six years? Or is it to pick the melons when they are ripe? I think it is worth studying today. What is the standard for the completion of ideological transformation? How can we see whether the transformation is completed or not? If we say that once the class is eliminated, the two-sidedness will be eliminated immediately, it is also very unrealistic. University graduates have university courses. It is difficult to have a course for ideological transformation. Even if there are still six years, we should make a six-year transformation plan. Representatives of the national bourgeoisie have cooperated in the past in certain situations to jointly oppose imperialism, bureaucracy, and feudalism. After the founding of the country, they accepted utilization, restriction, transformation, responded to various patriotic movements, supported the general line, and realized the overall joint state-private ownership. They have made certain contributions to economic construction in the past few years. Why do we still cling to this class relationship and class two-sidedness unchanged? What are the benefits to production and construction? Now the people of the whole country are moving towards socialism in big strides, but our national bourgeoisie are still bound by foot, unable to take big steps and run fast. We ask to let go of our feet and move forward bravely to contribute more to socialism.

He believes that now capitalists cannot possess the means of production and products. There is no difference between its position and that of workers in the social production system. The only difference is fixed interest, but fixed interest is ultimately not the possession of the means of production and the exploitation of doing whatever one wants.

Class! In a class society, everyone belongs to a certain group. What do we use to divide these groups? We divide them according to their position in the social production system. In other words, we divide them according to whether they possess or do not possess the means of production, whether they possess or do not possess the products produced, and whether they have the right to distribute the products. Each group is a class. The position of capitalists in the social production system is to possess the means of production, possess the products produced, and have the right to arbitrarily dispose of these products, while the position of workers in the social production system is to not possess the means of production, and the products they produce do not belong to them, so there is no question of distributing these products. These two different groups are two different classes. This is the concept of class. If we look at it from this definition, do the national bourgeoisie of today still possess the means of production? If we say that they still possess the means of production, it is not in line with reality, because now capitalists can no longer control the means of production we possessed in the past. At the same time, many capitalists no longer work in their original enterprises. Today, capitalists cannot possess products or control products. From these two aspects, there is no difference between the position of capitalists and workers in the social production system today. The only difference is that workers do not have fixed interest, and capitalists have fixed interest. Of course, conceptually speaking, the amount of fixed interest comes from the assessment of fixed assets, so it is said to be exploitation, and it is said to be unearned income, so it is also said to be exploitation, but the means is ultimately not to control the means of production and exploit as one pleases. Regarding this ideological issue, it exists in industrial and commercial circles, and it is an objective fact. Whether you agree with it or not, it exists, and this is a problem that will be solved sooner or later.

He said: Capitalists leaped into socialism like a fish leaping over the dragon gate. They did not expect that this class hat was still on their heads, class relations were still so emphasized, and two-sidedness was still so serious and unchanged. This is really puzzling.

I remember that on January 15, 1956, the people of Beijing, the first city in our great motherland to enter socialist society, held a celebration rally in Tiananmen Square to celebrate the victory of socialist transformation. Our great leader Chairman Mao and other responsible comrades of the Central Committee attended the rally. Mayor Peng Zhen solemnly announced that our capital had entered socialist society. At that time, the People's Daily published that "distant ideals have begun to become reality. In our country, the first socialist city has appeared. Later, on January 18, Tianjin and Xi'an also announced their entry into socialism, followed by Shanghai. I was very surprised, but soon after, this statement of entering socialist society was changed. At that time, the industrial and commercial circles were very excited and said, "Look, we have entered socialism without any pain. The class is really eliminated, and everyone is happy." It did not take many days of happiness for it to change. On the People's Daily on this day, it wrote, "In the past, many people in industrial and commercial circles imagined socialism to be a terrible thing, feeling that there was no future for them in socialist society. Now, they have accepted socialist transformation and have the same bright future." Many people in the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing like to use "fish leaping over the dragon gate" to describe the change in their status. As a result, are capitalists still "leaping over the dragon gate" but have not leaped over it? Or is the dragon gate closed? That newspaper also recorded that "Xu Chunlin, the young son of Xu Shiqing, the manager of Yihe Machine Factory, used to ask him: "The teacher at school said that the worker uncle is the best. Are you a worker?" Xu Shiqing had never answered this question because he did not want his young son to be an exploiter. But when he heard the news of the approval of joint state-private ownership, he happily told his son, "Your father is about to become a worker." The newspaper also said that "Under the control of this emotion, in just a few days, the valuation of over 17,000 industrial and commercial households in the city that had newly approved joint state-private ownership was working intensively from morning to night, and the work had basically been completed." This action is the first active manifestation of capitalists entering socialism. Tianjin, Shanghai, and all industrial and commercial cities across the country cannot deny this hot upsurge. Capitalists leaped into socialism like agile carp leaping over the dragon gate, but they did not expect that this class hat was still on their heads, class relations were still so emphasized, and two-sidedness was still so serious and unchanged. This is really puzzling. In the beginning, we reported the good news to Chairman Mao on behalf of the whole country at the CPPCC meeting. My opinion is that we should face up to the national bourgeoisie in the new situation and have a proper view of them, that is, how the working class should view the national bourgeoisie today. Because the national bourgeoisie has undergone such a fundamental change, the means of production have been returned to the working class. In order to better transform the national bourgeoisie into the working class and become new fighters in the working class ranks, the working class, the elder brother, should extend its hand and pull the younger brother who has turned back (of course, the working class has already been doing this), eliminate or reduce the past class hatred to a very small extent, and emphasize doing a good job in working relationships in the enterprise, without emphasizing class contradictions or class relations, so that we can negotiate affairs with each other on an equal working relationship (of course, under the leadership of the working class).

In short, I obey any interests that are beneficial to socialism. If wearing the hat of the national bourgeoisie can still play a certain role, then wear it for a few more years to better facilitate transformation.

### 为什么还要把阶级关系和两面性抓住不变？  毕鸣岐不同意千家驹的意见

专栏：

    为什么还要把阶级关系和两面性抓住不变？
    毕鸣岐不同意千家驹的意见
    编者注：这是毕鸣岐发言稿全文。标题和小插题是编者加的。
    千家驹同志的发言批判了某人所说的向工人阶级学习什么？
    批判了两面性和赎买政策的错误看法我是同意的，千是我们的老师，在几年改造中是给我们了很大帮助。如果不同意见作为交换意见。
    他认为：对私方人员某些所谓消极思想和作风没有批判，主要是为了先帮助党整风。
    在5月17日我曾以工人阶级怎样看民族资产阶级为题发表了我的看法，这是我个人这样看，同时也是我在工作中所听到一些工商界群众的反映和要求。尽管其中的一些看法高了些片面了些，我们应当肯定一点，其主要的是要求进步迅速的走入社会主义。这些思想矛盾的发生是为了迅速走入社会主义社会。把它反映出来为了正确处理人民内部矛盾是非常必要的，而且也是非常关键的问题。我认为有些企业的公私共事关系不好有一个很重要的一面是公方对于私方人员的心情体会不够，对于我们的进步要求还估计不足，我提出这个思想反映是从积极出发的是为了我们工商界更好的安心工作安心改造，在思想改造中使公方对私方能做到有底放矢。当然是在我谈的时候有缺点因为只提出了在生产关系起了根本变化之后对于民族资产阶级给予应有的评价（应当声明从全面安排量材录用适当照顾已经是给了充足的评价，例如说民族资产阶级是财富不是包袱，这是党和政府根据全业合营后私方人员有了积极表现给了我们这样一个评价，这是给私方人员很大的鼓励。但是，有职有权，受到尊重还不够），而对于私方人员在工作中尚存在着的某些所谓消极思想和作风就没有同时批判，因而使有的同志对于我的谈话有片面性，我的看法是主要帮助党整风，向党反映一部分党员同志在工作上的三大害，而对于我们工商界本身未提出检讨。俟党将整风运动不久胜利完成后，我们还要使工商界在公私共事关系上和职工改变观感上要求党对于我们加强教育也给我们以和风细两的来个整风，这次向一部分党员同志提出批评，这种精神也就是毛主席所教导的“教育人者首先受教育”我们先携助党整风然后再教育我们。
    当着我提出了工人阶级怎样看民族资产阶级的看法之后，有的同志说我给民族资产阶级评价过高了些。特别是我没把民族资产阶级在现阶段在企业中所存在的缺点和错误没有加以分析批判相对之下显的过高了和不适当了。总之在立场观点和方法上是给我了很大的启发和帮助。
    他认为：千家驹把个别的少数的当成全面，这不是马列主义的精神。
    对于千家驹同志的发言所提出的资产阶级的两面性和正确认识赎买政策我是一致的。至于他把我说讲的说加以引证之后，而没有交待清楚给扣帽子我是不同意的。例如他说毕鸣岐同志说“民族资产阶级把自己的企业交出来，不是简单的问题，这种思想斗争，思想变化的情况，是很多党员同志体会不到的。”千家驹同志引证了这个话之后接着说“的确，民族资产阶级交出企业是经过艰苦的思想斗争，这是他们接受改造的明证，也正因为如此，我们不能设想放弃之后，特别是当遇到一些工作上的困难时，不再存有不堪回首话当年的留恋之感，所谓“合营前小国之君，合营后大国之臣，合并后亡国之民”，不是这种心情的表现吗？
    我们在实践中所感觉的是经过艰苦斗争胜利之后那就是社会主义思想战胜资本主义思想主要的是提高了社会主义的觉悟和走社会主义的信心。例如自解放来抗美援朝、税收工作、公债等、受了教育之后内因是很重要的。至于我们所发现的个别人所作的打游诗“合营前小国之君，合营后大国之臣，合并后亡国之民”，在我们工商联和民建会提出以此进行教育，要警惕资产阶级的思想，加强思想改造，我们对于工商界中所能了解到的情况不管是少数的想法或者是个别人的想法，我们是毫无保留的向党反映，要求党更好的深入了解对我们加强进行社会主义改造，难道说这不是我们向党诚诚恳恳老老实实接受社会主义的具体表现吗？不能把个别的或少数的看成一般不能把个别的或少数的当做全面，这种分析法不是马列主义的实事求是的精神。
    他说：“民族资产阶级放弃生产资料而毫无留恋，比那赤手空拳的工人更加光荣”，这句话我没有说过，也没有听说过。
    我非常不同意千家驹同志说“同时，我们更不能同意认为民族资产阶级放弃生产资料而毫无留恋，比那赤手空拳的工人更加光荣”这句话我不仅是没有说过在我的思想深处也没有，我也没有听说民族资本家说过，凡是稍有一点社会主义思想的人们都懂得不管是什么社会制度是劳动创造世界，我们都深入人心的是自建国以来在工人阶级先锋队中国共产党的领导下工人阶级以他们有力的双手和智慧在社会主义建设上是取得了伟大胜利。我们的认识世界上的一切伟大创造是属于工人阶级的是属于劳动人民的。我不知道千家驹同志说的“比那赤手空拳的工人更加光荣”是从那里来的。同时这个大帽子的底下没有人还是摘下去好，教育人最好是以理服人采取用压力办法是不解决问题思想改造不是靠用扣帽子必须使我们从思想深处认清前途，一心一意的走社会主义。我们从八年来的社会主义改造中深深体会了这一点。
    教条主义者说资本主义工商业改造走上全业合营只说成是外因而他们体会的外因并不是说中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导而是说“外因”是“压力”。把民族资产阶级接受了教育认清发展规律掌握自己命运的自觉性的一面，就根本不存在。例如在全业合营前公私合营是一户一户的搞，我们曾经向党和政府提出意见，如果这样搞得搞一二十年，后来发展工商业申请的是一批一批，在1955年底全联执委会议听了毛主席的教导认识社会发展规律，认清前途掌握自己的命运，于是在56年初就掀起了一个全国性的高潮，这样的高潮不是谁要它来它就可以来，人们不能创造也不能制定在党和政府在事先也没准备来个高潮，我认为这个高潮是外因和内因相结合的，是瓜熟蒂落水到渠成。难道说这样一个高潮在全国范围内掀起来应当说这是“生产关系一定要适合生产力的发展，落后的生产方式，一定要被先进的生产方式所代替，资本主义必然为社会主义所代替，这是个社会发展规律。如果我们工商业者不认识或不承认这个规律，我们就掌握不了自己的命运。我们变化也不能到了今天。谁想不承认我们已经有了走社会主义的进步思想和要求那是同样违反社会发展的规律的，（当然应当声明不等于民族资产阶级改造完成，即便资产阶级消灭之后，资产阶级思想改造是长期的）。工商业者谁也不能否认。
    在我上次发言中说“在我们工商界思想改造有着如此变化的情况下，还给我们扣帽子，说我们留恋资本主义，走回头路等等。这样的教育，改造方法是与实际不符的”。我们的概念留恋资本主义，走回头路是指的“贪恋资本主义制度，留恋剥削，搞地下工厂，不愿在公私合营搞生产，而喜欢出来单干，虽然这是很少数的，但在工商界曾经不断发现过。
      千家驹同志所谈的“所谓资本主义一面，即指资本主义的思想意识，工作作风，工作方法等等。我们指他们还留恋资本主义是指思想情况，不是指他们还要走资本主义道路”。这个解释非常同意，也是给工商界解除了思想包袱。工商界的群众对于资本主义一面的想法正是如此，在过去在概念上有很大差别。
    他认为：全业合营后，阶级矛盾基本结束，还不加分析地说阶级存在两面性就存在，这种教条主义的方式是不能说服人的。
    千家驹同志说“关于资产阶级面性是否存在以及两面性应作怎样解释的问题。首先应问资产阶级今天是否已经全消灭”。我同意以上这个提法，这是个解决思想关键的问题，我们民族资产阶级经过几年以来党和政府所给我们的思想改造教育多般都认清即便使资产阶级消灭，资产阶级的思想改造还是长期的。没有人设想资产阶级的思想意识在阶级消灭之前而先消灭。有阶级就有两面性，就有阶级关系。这是多数工商业者所懂得的事，不过主要问题不在这里，我们应当回忆全业合营前几年来阶级教育工作是什么呢？我们说民族资产阶级有两面性，有积极的一面就是有利于国计民生的一面，有消极的一面如偷税漏税盗窃国家资财等五毒行为。这个印象深入人心自全业合营后民族资产阶级交出了企业，生产关系起了根本变化，阶级矛盾基本结束，我们的阶级教育还是说阶级仍然存在阶级关系存在，两面性也存在，并没有把阶级正在消灭过程到了什么程度？阶级关系在企业中是否是主要的？两面性的变化的程度如何？都未加分析就简单的说阶级存在两面性就存在，我们用这样一个教条主义的方式是不能说服人的。对于这个问题的态度工商界可能分两种一种是口服心不服，你说怎样就怎样，一种是口不服心也不服，甚至于他们说两面性没有了，主要是说的消极一面没有了，因为生产资料所有权都没了，使用什么还去犯五毒行为啊！他们说的没有是指的民族资本家还掌握着生产资料所有权来进行五毒行为的这种消极一面没有了。如果把道理讲清楚阶级存在资产阶级思想也存在，例如资本主义的思想意识，工作作风，工作方法等等这些属于思想改造的范畴，我相信工商界是会同意的，这样的概念是会使我们接受改造更有信心。
    千家驹同志说“资产阶级处在消灭过程之中，如认为已经消灭是不符合事实的。”他提出以下客观存在的事实作为证明，他说“事实是，国家每年还要付出一亿多元的定息，国家对资产阶级分子有生活
  上和政治上的各种安排和照顾，公私，工私之间还有矛盾，还存在着问题，这些都是客观存在的事实，非任何人主观的产物”。对于以上这个解释其中我有很大的不同看法，从定息存在阶级就存在国家对资产阶级分子有生活上的照顾因为和一般劳动人民不同，因而阶级也存在我也同意。至于说政治上的各种安排和照顾，公私，工私之间还有矛盾，还存在着问题，因而证明这是阶级存在我不同意，那么说在全业合营后对于我们的一切安排和照顾是由于阶级存在，俟到阶级消灭了是否全涮，我表示怀疑？事实党和政府不会这样做。
    千家驹同志又说“全业合营后，一方面资本家把生产资料交给国家基本上他已成为国家工作人员，是国家干部，就这一意义说，他已经是个劳动人民了”，以上这个说法好像是阶级消灭了。他又提出“但另一方面，他与一般劳动人民还有所不同，他拿定息，还有生活上的种种照顾（如高薪不减，病假期工资发50—70％等等，因而还保留资产阶级的身份”。对于以上这个分析我有不同看法，对于拿定息，高薪因而保留资产阶级身份我没意见，对于50—70％病假工资，因为有些私方人员不幸得病只拿到月工资的30％生活实在困难，他们享受不到什么劳保福利，因而经过反映才同意照此病假工资办法，何况至今尚未全面实行，即便实行了也不能以此就作为保留资产阶级身份，此外在工商界中有相当多的人没有定息可拿，工资还有的较工人为低，是否这些人应当宣布他们已经是工人阶级呢？
    最后再提出一个问题，使我们大家共同探讨，平心静气的来研究，不要扣帽子要实事求是讲道理，对于资本主义工商业改造的政策是我国新的创造，既无经典著作可以依据，苏联和其它兄弟国家也无有经验可供参考。
    他认为：阶级矛盾基本结束了，阶级是否也要基本结束。为什么现在还要把阶级关系，阶级两面性抓住不变？
    全业合营后生产关系起了根本变化，阶级矛盾基本结束了，阶级存在的成分也应当大大起变化，因为矛盾基本结束了，而阶级是否也要到基本结束，阶级关系是否就很淡薄了。应当说明不管是阶级存在或将来不存在思想改造是长期的。究竟阶级在什么程度下可以消灭，那么说就以定息还有六年为限了，这个时间照社会发展情况看时间是长呢还是短呢？我总认为时间相当长，因为现在是在一个高度的革命变化时期，很难估计，这样死板板的规定下来还有六年是否能适合社会发展规律，啊，现在是仅仅以定息扯着有定息就有阶级，有阶级就有阶级关系，有阶级就有两面性，这个进度究竟以什么为标准呢？以人的思想进步衡量呢？还是一定要规定还有六年呢？还是瓜熟蒂落随时摘瓜呢？我认在今天是很值得研究的问题。思想改造完成的标准是什么，怎样看出来改造完成或改造未完成。如果说阶级一旦消灭两面性也马上消灭了，也是很不现实。大学毕业有大学课程，对于思想改造能否有个课程是很困难，即便是还有六年也应当做出六年改造规划。民族资产阶级的代表人物在解放前在某一种情况下有过合作曾共同反帝反官僚反封建，建国以后就接受了利用限制改造响应各项爱国运动拥护总路线实现全业合营，几年来在经济建设上是有它一定的贡献，为什么现在还把这个阶级关系阶级两面性抓住不变，这在生产建设上有什么好处。现在全国人民正在以大踏步的向社会主义迈进，但是我们民族资产阶级还在缚着足，迈不开步，跑不快，要求放开足，勇往直前为社会主义贡献更大的力量。
    他认为：现在资本家已不能占有生产资料和产品，它和工人在社会生产体系中的地位是没有区别的，唯一的区别就是定息，但定息终究不是占有生产资料、为所欲为的剥削。
    阶级！在阶级社会里每一个人都是属于一定的集团的。拿什么来划分这些集团呢？那就以在社会生产体系中所处什么地位来划分。换句话说，就是对生产资料的占有与不占有，生产出来的产品的占有与不占有，有无对产品的分配权，从这几方面来划分出集团与集团的区别。每一个集团，就是一个阶级。资本家们在社会生产体系中的地位就是占有生产资料，占有生产出来的产品，并且有权来任意支配这些产品，而工人们在社会生产体系中的地位是不占有生产资料，自己生产出来的产品不归自己所有，也就谈不到来分配这产品。这两个不同的集团就是两个不同的阶级，这就是阶级的概念。如果从这个定义来看，今天的民族资产阶级还占有生产资料吗？若是说仍占有生产料，就与实际不相符了，因为现在资本家已不能再支配我们过去所占有的生产资料了，同时有许多资本家都不在他原企业工作了。今天资本家也不能占有产品了，也不能支配产品了。从这个两方面来看资本家和工人今天在社会生产体系中的地位是没有什么区别的，惟一的区别就是工人没有定息，资本家有定息。当然定息从概念上说，定息的大小是从定产核资来的，因此说是剥削，是不劳而获的因此说也是剥削，但其手段终究不是自己掌握生产料，而为所欲为的剥削。关于这个思想问题，是在工商界中存在着，它是个客观事实，你同意它它也存在，你不同意它也是存在着，这是早晚要解决的问题。
    他说：资本家鱼跳龙门式地跳入社会主义，没有想到这顶阶级帽子还带着，阶级关系还那样强调着，两面性还那样原封不动的严重，实令人难解。
    我记得1956年1月15日，我们伟大祖国的第一个进入社会主义社会的城市——北京市的人民，在天安门广场庆祝社会主义改造胜利联欢大会，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和中央其他负责同志出席了这个大会，彭真市长庄严地宣布：我们的首都已经进入了社会主义社会。那时人民日报上登载说“远大的理想，已经开始变成了现实，在我们的国家里，已经出现了第一个社会主义的城市，以后于1月18日天津西安也宣布进入了社会主义，连着又来了个上海，我很奇怪，可是没有不久，这个进入社会主义社会的说法就改了。那时工商界非常兴奋的说“看那，我们没有什么痛苦已经进入了社会主义了，真是阶级消灭个人愉快，没有愉快几天就变了。在这天的人民日报上写着“过去，不少的工商界人士把社会主义想像成是很可怕的东西，觉得在社会主义社会里没有自己的前途。现在他们接受了社会主义改造，同样有了美好的前途。北京市工商界的许多人都喜欢用“鱼跃龙门来形容自己地位的变化。结果又是资本家鱼跃龙门”没有跃过去呢？还是龙门关上了呢？那个报上还有记载“义合机器厂经理徐世清小儿子徐春林，过去常问他：“学校老师说工人叔叔最好，你是不是工人？”徐世清为了不愿意使幼小的儿子自己是个剥削者，一直没有回答这个问题。可是当他听到批准公私合营的消息以后，很很高兴的告诉他儿子“你爸爸快要变成工人了。”在报上还说“就是在这种情绪的支配下，在短短的几天内，全市新批准公私合营的一万七千多家工商户的清产估价工作，从早晨到深夜紧张工作着，而工作已经基本完成了。这一行动，就是资本家们跨入社会主义后的第一个积极表现。天津上海和全国工商城市谁也不能否认这个热火朝天的高潮。资本家们以矫健的鲤鱼跳龙门式跳入社会主义，没有想到这顶阶级帽子还带着，阶级关系还那样强调着，两面性还那样原封不动的严重，实令人难解。当初我们代表全国在政协大会上向毛主席报喜。我的意见是应当正视新形势下的民族资产阶级应当有其恰如其分的看法，那就是说工人阶级在今天应当怎样来看民族资产阶级，由于民族资产阶级有了这样一个根本变化，生产资料交还了工人阶级，为了更好的改造民族资产阶级变成工人阶级思想，成为工人阶级队伍中的新战士就应当把老大哥的手伸出来拉回头是岸的小弟弟一把（当然工人阶级早已在做着），把过去的阶级仇恨勾消，或者减少到很小限度上去，在企业岗位上强调搞好共事关系，不要再强调什么阶级矛盾，什么阶级关系，这样就可彼此以平等的工作关系来协商办事。（当然是在工人阶级领导下）
    总之凡是为社会主义有好处的我是服从这个利益的，所带着民族资产阶级的帽子还能起一定作用，那就多带几年。以便更好利于改造。
