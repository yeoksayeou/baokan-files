    Support the Patriotic Struggle of the Korean People
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The American occupation troops in South Korea are becoming increasingly lawless. On April 16th, eighty military police from the 24th U.S. Infantry Division, under the pretext of a "search," raided 305 Korean households in Yeonpung-ri, Paju County, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, looting 2,324 items of property and abducting more than seventy Koreans. This is outright banditry and robbery. It cannot but fill every Korean with national self-respect with righteous indignation.
    The Yeonpung-ri incident is a new sign of the Korean nation's disaster. The occurrence of such incidents is not accidental. From the day the American army occupied South Korea, its purpose has been to turn South Korea into an American barracks and colony, in order to enslave, trample upon, and plunder the South Korean people at will, and to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the American aggressors. Therefore, under the iron heel of the U.S. military, incidents of South Korean residents being shot, robbed, and humiliated have emerged one after another, and they have not had a single good day. It can be asserted that as long as there are American troops stationed in South Korea, this disaster for South Korean residents will not end.
    Not only that, but the American military occupation of South Korea, using force to support the Syngman Rhee clique, and the long-term division of Korea, has brought profound disasters to the entire Korean nation. This is fundamentally incompatible with the national and peaceful interests of all the Korean people.
    Therefore, the Yeonpung-ri incident tells the Korean people a truth: that all patriotic Koreans should unite and fight for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, for the peaceful reunification of Korea, and for national freedom. Currently, South Korean public opinion has expressed angry condemnation of the Yeonpung-ri incident. On April 27th, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea issued the slogan "American troops get out of Korean territory," calling on members of patriotic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea to fight for the realization of this slogan. This is the common voice and common will of the patriotic people of Korea.
    All those who are concerned about the cause of peace support this patriotic struggle of the Korean people. Our government and people have repeatedly advocated that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea at the same time, allowing the Korean people to solve their own problems, but the United States has stubbornly refused to do so. This attitude of the United States has always been the main obstacle to consolidating peace in Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, no matter how arrogant the United States is, it will not be the United States that ultimately decides the fate of the Korean nation, but the Korean people themselves.

    支持朝鲜人民的爱国斗争
    本报评论员
    南朝鲜的美国占领军越来越无法无天了。4月16日，美军第二十四师的八十名宪兵竟以“搜查”为名，袭击了南朝鲜京畿道坡州郡延丰里的三百零五户朝鲜居民，抢劫了两千三百二十四件财物，并且绑架去七十多个朝鲜人。这是十足的土匪和强盗行为。它不能不使每一个有民族自尊心的朝鲜人感到义愤填膺。
    延丰里事件是朝鲜民族灾难的一个新标志。这种事件的发生并不是偶然的。自从美国军队占领南朝鲜的一天起，它的目的就是要把南朝鲜变为美国的一个兵营和殖民地，以便为所欲为地奴役、蹂躏和掠夺南朝鲜人民，并驱使他们充当美国侵略者的炮灰。因此，在美军的铁蹄之下，南朝鲜居民被枪杀、被抢劫、被凌辱的事件层出不穷，他们就没有过过一天好日子。可以断定，只要有美国军队驻在南朝鲜，南朝鲜居民的这种灾难就不会终止。
    不仅这样。美国军队占领南朝鲜，用武力支持李承晚集团，长期分裂朝鲜，更给整个朝鲜民族带来了深重的灾难。这是同全体朝鲜人民的民族利益和和平利益根本不相容的。
    因此，延丰里事件告诉朝鲜人民一个真理，那就是一切爱国的朝鲜人民应该团结起来，为要求美军撤出南朝鲜、为争取朝鲜的和平统一和民族自由而斗争。现在，南朝鲜舆论界已对延丰里事件提出愤怒的指责。4月27日，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会更发出“美国军队从朝鲜的领土上滚出去”的口号，号召南北朝鲜各爱国政党和社会团体的成员，为实现这个口号而斗争。这就是朝鲜爱国人民的共同的声音和共同的意志。
    一切关心和平事业的人们都支持朝鲜人民的这一爱国的斗争。我国政府和人民曾一再主张一切外国军队应该同时撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题，然而美国却始终顽固地加以拒绝。美国的这种态度一直就是巩固朝鲜和平和实现朝鲜和平统一的主要障碍。但是，不论美国如何蛮横，最后决定朝鲜民族命运的不会是美国，而是朝鲜人民自己。
