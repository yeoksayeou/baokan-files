The People's Daily report: The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee invited leaders of various democratic parties and non-party democrats to continue holding a symposium on the 11th. The speakers at the meeting included Wang Yifan, member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party; Xiong Kewu, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Qian Jiaju, deputy secretary-general of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and member of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association; Huang Dingchen, standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party; Yang Yitang, deputy director of the Organization department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party; Cai Tingkai, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Feng Binfu, standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; and Huang Yaomian, standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. In addition, Li Chunqing, vice chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, made a written statement.

    Wang Yifan:
    Soliciting opinions guarantees improved work
    But then, things are thrown to the winds
    Wang Yifan said in his first speech that since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao further clarified the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," he believed that not only had the democratic parties taken on greater responsibilities, but the United Front Work Department had as well. However, the guiding ideology of the United Front Work Department overemphasized respecting the independence, freedom, and equality of the democratic parties, to the extent that what should have been managed was not, and what should have been done was not.
    In the past year, the leading party and the United Front Work Department have taken many measures to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," but there are still many problems. I think this is because the United Front Work Department's working methods are not correct. It hasn't worked well based on the characteristics of each democratic party, and there are still many things that don't meet the needs in practical work, and the work isn't thorough enough. For example, the long-term coexistence policy has not been well discussed with the leaders of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Of course, we ourselves were not proactive either. In addition, he also hoped that the United Front Work Department would help solve the problems of housing and funding.
    Wang Yifan also criticized the situation where some agencies did not attach importance to United Front Work. He said that the part-time United Front Work members in some units do not pay attention to or are not enthusiastic about United Front Work. Seriously, it is simply a formality and does not play a role. Some agencies pay more attention to United Front Work when studying the documents of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the speeches of central leaders on United Front Work. They mobilize non-Party members to put forward opinions, and the leaders also guarantee to improve the work. However, after some time, those opinions and guarantees are thrown to the winds. Does the United Front Work Department know about these situations?
    Finally, he said that Chairman Mao said that 90% of the people in the party did not understand the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision." If the ideological level of the Communist Party members is like this, then more members and masses of the democratic parties will not understand it. He believes that strengthening publicity and education, further expanding the democratic life of the masses, and strengthening the work of democratic parties should raise everyone's awareness and do a good job in the work of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. He hoped that there would be more cross-relationships between CPC members and democratic party members, and that CPC members should not only gradually withdraw from democratic parties, but also cultivate and develop party objects in the members of democratic parties to change everyone's views.

    Xiong Kewu:
    Let non-Party members "in their positions, plan their administration"
    Xiong Kewu spoke about the issue of having positions, power, and responsibility, saying that this is a matter of defining responsibilities and establishing relevant systems. A reasonable system of division of labor and responsibility should be established. It should be recognized that the phenomenon of power and responsibility being transferred by people will foster and develop factionalism. He said that in fact, we already have the best system, which is the system of combining division of labor and responsibility with collective leadership. Why hasn't the system been strictly implemented? This needs to be checked. He said that position and power are closely linked to play a role. Since he has a position, what reason is there not to give him power and responsibility? If it is due to political trust, then not only should power and responsibility be considered, but making him have a position should also be carefully considered. He also talked about the fact that people without considerable working ability should not be put in their positions, and those with superior talents, if they are in their positions, should not be allowed to "not plan their administration." This is a matter of whether the personnel system is sound and whether the personnel arrangements are appropriate, especially whether the national institutions can normally play a positive role. He said that to improve the relationship between the party and non-party cooperation, it is imperative to solve these problems.
    Xiong Kewu said that solving the issue of having positions, power, and responsibility is also one of the tasks of "dismantling walls" and "filling ditches." Since the policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" was proposed, and recently through the inspection of United Front Work, the estrangement between the party and non-party has been greatly eliminated, but it is still not completely harmonious and requires further efforts. He also cited two examples of uncoordinated relations between party members and democratic party members in Chongqing. He believes that the estrangement comes from both sides. Because their thinking is not in line and there are problems with their work style, they should correct their thinking, improve their work style, and correct them. He said that this rectification campaign will also guide non-party members to strengthen their studies. He also suggested that democratic parties should encourage members to actively participate in the rectification movement on a voluntary basis.
    He also put forward opinions on improving the legal system. He said that this is not only related to the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, but also has important significance for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Due to the current incompleteness of the legal system and insufficient publicity of policies and guidelines, not only are the people confused about certain matters, but some leaders sometimes inevitably show a lack of direction. He cited an example, saying that a person was arrested during the Three-Anti Campaign and has not yet been clearly announced the outcome of the handling. He said that this case has caused confusion among the people. If the legal system is complete and there is a legal basis, not only will it not cause such confusion, but it can also educate them to distinguish right from wrong and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves.

    Qian Jiaju:
    Party committees and Party groups replace the administration
    Qian Jiaju talked about several issues.
    One is the issue of having positions and power. He said that various agencies have varying degrees of the phenomenon of democratic figures having positions without power; there are also those with positions and power, but they are in the minority. Generally speaking, if the party members who hold leadership positions have a high level and a democratic style, then non-party members will have more power; if the party members have a narrow style and serious sectarianism, the phenomenon of non-party members having positions without power will be prominent. The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education live in the same yard, and it is said that the situation is different. In recent years, the Party Central Committee and the United Front Work Department have repeatedly emphasized that democratic figures should have positions, power, and responsibility. Although it cannot be said that there has been no improvement, why does the problem still exist? He believes that in addition to the fact that the policy and ideology of United Front Work have not been implemented, there is also a system problem, that is, there is no good system to ensure that democratic figures have positions and power, and to restrict the absolute power of party members. The Communist Party is the leading party, and party members should take on more responsibilities in their work, and the party group should ensure the completion of the tasks of the agency. This should be affirmed and no one opposes it. But in fact, now the party committee or the party group replaces the administration, and the decisions of the party group are sometimes issued without going through the administration. Some decisions are known to party members who work as clerks and secretaries, but non-party leading cadres do not know. The party system should be a thick line, but the administrative system should not be a dotted line. The party committee or party group should arrange work through the administration rather than directly. He said that the situation in his agency is relatively good because he attends party group meetings as a non-voting delegate.
    In addition, he talked about the fact that many non-party members working in agencies cannot grasp the overall situation, cannot attend many meetings, and cannot see many documents, so they cannot exert their strength. Non-party members should not read or participate in party documents and party meetings, and no one has made such requests. The problem is that some meetings in the administrative system also often restrict non-party members from participating, and the same is true for documents, always "rather strict than lenient." In fact, some meetings are not party meetings, but party members have the opportunity to participate, while non-party members do not. This has become a habit. This is also a system problem.
    The second is about the issue of promoting cadres. He said that the current situation is that the progressiveness of non-party intellectuals is underestimated. Non-party members who are strong in working ability and high in level are rarely able to give full play to their strengths, and even less are promoted (with the exception of senior democratic figures who are taken care of). Party member cadres have higher quality and are politically reliable, which is certainly true, but overemphasizing this point without looking at working ability is also unfair. Some individual party members even have low cultural and professional abilities. Relying on being politically good does not solve the problem and will cause losses to the work. This kind of personnel use is not using people according to their abilities or virtues. This situation is more serious in agencies and better in the scientific and technological community. Then he said that people with complex political situations should not be reused, but most of them are politically progressive, but they are not reused simply because they are not party members.
    The third problem is that he hopes to understand the ideological situation of senior intellectuals in depth, rather than just listening to the one-sided reports of party members. He said that Chinese senior intellectuals have a high degree of self-esteem, obey the truth and are not intimidated by authority, and "scholars can be killed but not humiliated," which is a good tradition and should not be attacked. It is not good to ingratiate oneself with the party after liberation.
    Fourth, Qian Jiaju believes that those who were wrongly criticized in the "Three-Anti" "Ideological Remoulding" or "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries" campaigns should be clearly explained to him, and this is not settling old scores. Chinese senior intellectuals are self-respecting, and if their self-esteem is hurt, their enthusiasm will not recover in the long run. Qian Jiaju cited specific examples to illustrate this situation.
    Finally, Qian Jiaju criticized the serious sectarianism of individual party members in the economics field, believing that this style should be changed to unite the vast number of Chinese economists.

    Huang Dingchen:
    When selecting experts to go abroad, the scope should be widened
    Huang Dingchen first asked the United Front Work Department for more help with the work of the Zhi Gong Party. He said that the Zhi Gong Party's working targets are overseas Chinese, and there are special difficulties in the work, because it involves many policy issues in diplomacy, overseas Chinese affairs, finance, culture, and education. Without the help of the United Front Work Department, it is difficult to do the work well. He hoped that the government could consider selecting some suitable people from the Zhi Gong Party to participate in the trade and cultural delegations sent to foreign countries so that they could carry out work among the overseas Chinese. He also said that the Zhi Gong Party is a small party, and the number of people participating in the leadership work of state organs is very small, so they cannot understand the country's policies in a timely manner. Many overseas Chinese have raised this issue after returning to China, and many overseas Chinese measure the Zhi Gong Party's position in the democratic parties by the number of people participating in the leadership work of state organs. Some Zhi Gong Party members who have participated in the work of state organs now also feel great pressure and do not have time to participate in the activities and work of the Zhi Gong Party.
    Huang Dingchen also put forward opinions on the relationship between the party and the administration in the organs. He said that the party group or party committee has played a great role in ensuring the completion of the tasks of the organs, which no one will deny. However, in the past, the party group often directly replaced the administration in arranging work, which made non-party leaders feel that they had positions without power. Although the situation has changed somewhat now, members of democratic parties can also participate in certain party group meetings to jointly study and decide on issues. However, after the discussion, the party group still directly arranges the work, so only party members can see it, and the non-party cadres below do not know. I think that in the future, the administrative work should be ordered by the administration, rather than by the party group.
    Finally, Huang Dingchen mentioned the issue of experts participating in international activities. He believes that in the past, the relevant departments selected experts to participate in international activities, always limited to a few people. This has a very bad impact. Although the subjective intention of the relevant leaders is to start from work, objectively it has formed sectarianism, which has caused many experts who cannot participate in international activities to have opinions. He advocated widening the scope.

    Yang Yitang:
    Some heads of party committees in government organs have an unclear understanding of democratic parties
    In his speech, Yang Yitang mentioned that not only do some ordinary party members have an unclear understanding of the role of democratic parties, but also some heads of party committees in government organs. He cited a fact. In Hunan, there was a member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party whose husband was a Communist Party member. After she joined the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, her husband proposed a divorce, saying: Why have you fallen to this point! Democratic parties are bourgeois political parties, and you have been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie! Later, the matter went to the party committee secretary of the agency, but who knew that the party committee secretary said: You are all in your twenties and thirties, so you should handle the matter yourselves!
    From this, he concluded that the main problem with the issue of democratic party members having positions and power in their work is still the problem of understanding democratic parties. Although Communist Party members and democratic party members may both be responsible, the main responsibility still lies with the leading party, "because it is the leading party!"
    Yang Yitang also mentioned that the organizational development of the democratic parties mainly targets intellectuals. This creates a contradiction of competing for targets. This phenomenon has occurred in Shanghai, Chongqing, Changsha... and other places. He suggested that the United Front Work Department should help consider the key points of the development targets of the democratic parties to resolve this contradiction.

    Cai Tingkai:
    Willing to provide materials to help the Communist Party rectify its work style
    Cai Tingkai said that he is willing to provide materials to help the Communist Party rectify its work style. He said that the United Front Work is done well in the central government. However, when he went to the countryside for inspection, he saw that the situation in the county and township levels was different from that in the central government. Some township cadres have no culture, do not know the United Front Work policy, and do not know how many democratic parties there are in our country. In some places, sectarianism is very strong, and the cadres are all Communist Party members, while knowledgeable and cultured people are left aside. He also said that in the county, power is concentrated in the CPC county committee, while the power of the county people's committee is very small.
    Cai Tingkai also talked about the difficulties of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in contacting people in society, as well as the internal contradictions of the democratic parties.

    Feng Binfu:
    Exploring above and below to find a confidant
    Encountering coldness
    Feng Binfu said that the China Association for Promoting Democracy is a party mainly composed of middle school teachers. From the perspective of most members, their status has undergone fundamental changes, but they seem to still require some spiritual and inner sustenance, and the traditional concept of "a scholar dies for his confidant" is still very deep in the minds of many members. They explore above and below to find a "confidant" to settle their souls. He said that in my opinion, many of these people are willing to regard the Communist Party as their "confidant." Therefore, they are particularly sensitive to the rigid style and cold attitude of some party members. He hoped that helping them with these characteristics of intellectuals would yield greater gains. He also hoped that the United Front Work Department would help the China Association for Promoting Democracy do a good job in grass-roots organization work. He said that recently, some members felt that after joining the China Association for Promoting Democracy, there was no difference from before joining the association, and they did not receive more help; individual members reflected that if this continues, they would withdraw from the association. He hoped that the United Front Work Department would help the China Association for Promoting Democracy solve this problem.

    Huang Yaomian:
    If a party member is wrong, it is also right
    If a non-party member is right, it is also wrong
    When talking about the relationship between the party and non-party members, Huang Yaomian said that the most important shortcoming at present is that the relationship between the party and non-party members is not good. He believes that in some things, even if a party member is wrong, he is considered to be right, and even if a non-party member is right, he is considered to be wrong. A party member can be promoted three levels in a year, but a non-party member cannot be promoted even one level in three or five years despite working diligently. If a party member makes a mistake, he conducts a self-criticism within the party behind closed doors, and as long as he is not subject to organizational punishment, he still has power in his hands. If a non-party member makes a mistake, the party organization rarely educates and helps him, allowing him to fend for himself on the one hand and starting to take organizational action against him on the other hand.
    He said that some school leaders are afraid to meet with teachers and masses, and specialize in sitting in the office to listen to reports from party and league members, creating a situation where some masses are afraid to contact party and league members. Some party members are also complacent and arrogant, have privileged thinking, do not read much, rely on the party for food, talk about Marxism-Leninism, but are unwilling to study hard. He said that this rectification campaign is really very necessary.
    Huang Yaomian also criticized the work of the United Front Work Department. He said that the United Front Work Department does not have a wide range of contacts. Everyone has criticized the United Front Work Department in the past, and the United Front Work Department has also made self-criticism, but it has not changed after the criticism, with a rather "sincerely accept, resolutely do not change" spirit. Secondly, the United Front Work policy is difficult to promote at the provincial level. Some party members simply do not understand or understand the United Front Work policy very vulgarly. Thirdly, the United Front Work Department lacks concern for the full-time cadres of the democratic parties and lacks a complete plan for education, training, and promotion, and has not given them a certain status. Huang Yaomian suggested: (1) The current situation has changed, and many past practices should be reconsidered; (2) The Communist Party should strengthen the publicity and study of the United Front Work policy, and at the same time, a set of systems and methods should be formulated to guarantee the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"; (3) Some government agencies, such as cultural and educational departments, should put administrative leadership in the hands of administrative meetings composed of Communist Party and non-Party leaders; (4) The grass-roots organizations of the democratic parties should have a certain status in each government agency; (5) Under the guidance of the policies indicated by the Party, the Party and non-Party members should stand on an equal footing, compete with each other, reward those who are meritorious, and punish those who are at fault. Those who are capable should be promoted, and those who are incompetent and unqualified should be demoted.

    Li Chunqing:
    Hope that the United Front Work Department will not look down on the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    Li Chunqing made several hopes in his written statement. He said that recently we decided to develop our organization. We plan to establish new institutions in Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Fujian. We hope to get the help of the relevant local United Front Work Departments. He also said that in recent years, thousands of overseas Chinese have returned from Japan, more than half of whom are Taiwanese compatriots. Their families, relatives, and friends are all in Taiwan. It is a manifestation of loving the motherland to return to the mainland instead of returning to Taiwan. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League is preparing to develop its organization and carry out work among Taiwanese overseas Chinese. We hope to get the help of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Since last year, some Taiwanese youths have fled back to the mainland, and there may be more and more in the future. We hope that the relevant parties will treat this matter as a special issue, arrange their work, and give them warm care.
    Li Chunqing finally said that in the past, when the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League mentioned issues to the United Front Work Department, they were often delayed again and again and could not be put on the agenda. I dare not say that the United Front Work Department has bureaucracy, because the affairs of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League are too small. However, it is a small matter in the eyes of the United Front Work Department, but it is a big matter in the eyes of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. I hope that the comrades of the United Front Work Department will not look down on the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League in their thinking.
    The symposium will continue.

### 各民主党派负责人在统战部的座谈会上继续发表意见  批评共产党以党代政　要求民主人士有职有权

    各民主党派负责人在统战部的座谈会上继续发表意见
    批评共产党以党代政　要求民主人士有职有权
    本报讯　中共中央统战部邀集各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士在11日继续举行座谈会。会上发言的有中国农工民主党中央执行局委员王一帆，中国国民党革命委员会副主席熊克武，中国民主同盟中央副秘书长、中国民主建国会中央委员千家驹，中国致公党中央常务委员黄鼎臣，中国农工民主党中央委员会组织部副部长杨逸棠，中国国民党革命委员会副主席蔡廷锴，中国民主促进会中央常务委员冯宾符，中国民主同盟中央常务委员黄药眠。另外，台湾民主自治同盟副主席李纯青作了书面发言。
      王一帆：
    征求意见保证改进工作
    事过境迁抛到九霄云外
    王一帆首先发言说，自从党中央和毛主席进一步明确提出“长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，我认为不仅是民主党派加重了责任，而且统战部同样加重了责任。但统战部的指导思想，过于强调了尊重民主党派的独立、自由、平等，以致应该管的未管，应该做的未做。
    一年来，领导党和统战部都采取了不少措施来贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，但是还有不少问题。我以为这是由于统战部的工作方法不对头，没有很好根据各民主党派的特点进行工作，在实际工作上还有很多不符合需要，工作不深入。如长期共存方针，就未很好地和农工民主党负责人商量。当然我们自己也未主动。另外他还希望统战部帮助解决房屋和经费问题。
    对于某些机关不重视统战工作的情况，王一帆也提出了批评。他说，有些单位的兼职统战委员，对统战工作不重视、不热心，严重的简直形同虚设，没有起作用。有些机关，当学习人民代表大会、政治协商会议的文件和中央负责同志关于统战工作的讲话的时候，对统战工作就比较重视，发动党外人士提意见，领导上也保证要改进工作，但事过境迁，又把那些意见和保证都抛到九霄云外去了。这些情况不知道统战部了解不了解？
    最后他说，毛主席说党内有90％的人对“长期共存、互相监督”的方针思想不通。以共产党员的思想水平，尚且如此，民主党派的成员和群众就会有更多的人思想不通。他认为应该通过加强宣传教育工作，进一步扩大群众的民主生活和加强民主党派的工作，来提高大家的认识，搞好长期共存，互相监督的工作。他希望中共党员和民主党派党员有更多的交叉关系，共产党员不但不应该从民主党派中逐步撤退，而且更要在民主党派成员中多多培养发展党的对象，以改变大家的看法。
      熊克武：
    让非党人士“在其位谋其政”
    熊克武谈到有职有权有责的问题的时候说，这是职责划分和有关制度建立的问题。应该确立合理地分工负责的制度。应该看到那种以人为转移而有权责和无权责的现象，会使宗派主义滋长和发展。他说，其实我们已经有最好的制度，这就是分工负责与集体领导相结合的制度。为什么没有严格执行制度呢？这需要检查。他谈到，职和权密切联系在一起，才能发挥作用。既然使他有职，有什么理由不使他有权、有责呢？如果是由于政治信任的关系，那末不但有权有责需要考虑，就是使其有职也应慎重。他还谈到，没有相当工作能力的人，就不应使他在其位，具有优越才能的，使其在其位，就不应使他“不谋其政”。这是关系人事制度是否健全、人事安排是否妥当的问题，尤其关系国家机构能否正常地发挥积极作用的问题。他说，搞好党与非党合作共事关系，解决上面这些问题是不容或缓的。
    熊克武说，解决有职有权有责问题，也是“拆墙”、“填沟”的工作之一。“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出以后，近来又通过对统战工作的检查，党与非党之间的隔阂已经大大消除，但还不是融洽无间，仍然要作进一步努力。他还举出了重庆市党员与民主党派成员在工作中关系不协调的两个例子。他认为隔阂是来自双方。因为彼此间思想不对头，作风有问题，因此应端正思想，改进作风，加以纠正。他说，这次整风也会引导党外人士加强自己的学习。他还建议民主党派尽量鼓励成员在自愿原则下积极参加整风运动。
    他还提出了关于健全法制的意见。他说这不仅有关肃反工作，对于正确处理人民内部矛盾也有重要意义。由于目前法制不完备，政策方针的宣传不够深入，不但人民群众对某些事务感到模糊，就是有些领导人有时也免不了表现出无所适从。他举例说，有一个人在三反时被捕了，至今还没有明确宣示处理情况。他说，这个案件使人民群众发生了模糊的认识。假如法制完备，有了法律依据，不但不会使人发生这样模糊的认识，并且能教育他们辨明是非，分清敌我。
    千家驹：
    党委和党组代替了行政
    千家驹谈了几个问题。
    一是有职有权问题。他说，各机关存在程度不同的民主人士有职无权现象；有职有权的也有，但是少数。一般说，如果担任领导工作的党员水平高，有民主作风，非党人士权就多一些；如果党员作风偏狭，宗派主义情绪严重，非党人士有职无权的现象就突出。高教部和教育部住在一个院子里，据说情况就不同。几年来，党中央和统战部一再强调民主人士有职有权有责，虽不能说没有改进，但为什么问题仍然存在？他认为，除去统一战线工作的政策思想没有贯彻以外，还有制度问题，就是没有好的制度来保证民主人士有职有权，来制约党员的大权独揽。共产党是领导党，党员要在工作中多负些责任，党组要保证机关工作任务的完成，这是应该肯定的，没有人反对。但事实上，现在党委或党组代替行政，党组的决定有时不通过行政而下达，有些决定，担任科员、秘书工作的党员都知道了，而非党的领导干部还不知道。党的系统应该是一条粗线，但是行政系统不应当是虚线。党委或党组应该通过行政而不是直接布置工作。他说他所在的机关情况比较好，因为他列席参加党组会。
    另外，他谈到，在机关工作的许多非党人士，不能掌握全面情况，许多会不能参加，许多文件看不到，因而无从发挥力量。党内文件、党内会议，非党员自不应阅读、参加，也没有人提出这种要求。问题是有些行政系统的会议也常限制非党员参加，文件也是如此，总是“宁严毋宽”。其实有些会议并非党内会议，但党员有机会参加，而非党员就没有机会。这已经形成了一种习惯。这也是制度问题。
    第二是关于提拔干部的问题。他说，现在存在的情况是，对非党知识分子进步性估计不足。非党员工作能力强，水平高，很少能发挥所长，更少提升（高级民主人士受到照顾者例外）。党员干部品质较高，政治可靠，这是肯定的，但过于着重这一条，不看工作能力，也不公平。甚至有个别党员文化水平低，业务能力低。靠政治好，不解决问题，会给工作造成损失。这样用人不是用人唯能，或用人唯贤。这种情况，机关里较严重，科学技术界较好。接着他说，对政治情况复杂的人，自不应重用，但一般的都是政治进步，只因为不是党员而不受重用。
    第三个问题是，他希望能够深入地了解高级知识分子的思想情况，而不要专听党员的片面汇报。他说，中国高级知识分子有高度自尊心，服从真理而不慑于权威，“士可杀不可辱”，这是优良传统，不应该打击。解放后唯唯诺诺靠拢党，这是不好的。
    第四，千家驹认为在“三反” “思想改造”或“肃反”中斗错了的人，应向他解释清楚，这不是算老账。中国高级知识分子是有自尊心的，伤了他的自尊心，积极性在长期内不能恢复。千家驹举出具体的事例，说明这种情况。
    最后，千家驹批评了经济学界中个别党员同志的严重的宗派主义作风，认为这种作风应加改变，以团结广大的中国经济学者。
      黄鼎臣：
    选派专家出国  要把面放宽一些
    黄鼎臣在发言中，首先要求统战部对致公党的工作作更多的帮助。他说，致公党的工作对象是海外华侨，工作上有特殊困难，因为涉及到外交、侨务、财务、文教等方面的方针政策问题很多，没有统战部的帮助，工作很难做好。他希望政府在派出国的贸易、文化代表团时，能考虑选派一些致公党中条件适合的人参加，以便他们在华侨中开展工作。他还说，致公党是小党，参加国家机关领导工作的人数很少，不能及时了解国家的方针政策。很多华侨回国后都提出这个问题，而且很多海外华侨都以参加国家机关领导工作的人数多少来衡量致公党在民主党派中的地位。有些参加了国家机关工作的致公党成员，现在也感到压力很大，没有时间参加致公党的活动和工作。
    对于机关中的党和行政的关系问题，黄鼎臣也提出了意见。他说，党组或党委对保证机关任务的完成起了很大的作用，这是谁也不会否认的。但是，过去党组常常直接代替行政布置工作，使非党领导人员感到有职无权。现在情况虽然有些改变，民主党派成员也可以参加某些党组会议，共同研究决定问题。但是，讨论以后仍由党组直接向下布置，这样仍然只有党员可以看到，下面的非党干部就不知道。我以为今后行政方面的工作，还是由行政上下达命令较好，而不要由党组出面。
    最后，黄鼎臣提到专家参加国际活动的问题。他认为过去有关部门选派专家参加国际活动，老是限于少数几个人。这样做影响很不好。虽然有关领导上主观意图是从工作出发的，但客观上却形成了宗派主义，使许多不能参加国际活动的专家有意见。他主张把面放宽一些。
      杨逸棠：
    一些机关党委负责人对民主党派认识不清
    杨逸棠发言中谈到，对民主党派的作用，不仅一些一般党员认识不清，就是一些机关的党委负责人也认识不清。他举了一件事实。在湖南，有一个农工民主党党员，她的丈夫是共产党员。她参加农工民主党以后，她丈夫就提出要离婚，并且说：你为什么堕落到这种地步！民主党派是资产阶级政党，你中了资产阶级的糖衣炮弹！后来事情闹到机关的党委书记那里，谁知党委书记却说：你们都是二、三十岁的人了，问题还是由你们自己去处理吧！
    由此他得出结论说，民主党派成员在工作中有职有权问题，主要还是对民主党派的认识问题。虽然共产党员和民主党派成员双方可能都有责任，但主要还是领导党的问题，“因为是领导党嘛！”
    杨逸棠还谈到，各民主党派发展组织，对象多是知识分子。这样就发生了互相争取对象的矛盾。上海、重庆、长沙……等地都出现过这种现象。他提出，统战部应该帮助考虑各民主党派发展对象的重点，以便解决这种矛盾。
      蔡廷锴：
    愿意提供材料  帮助共产党整风
    蔡廷锴说，他愿意提供材料，帮助共产党整风。他说，在中央，统一战线工作做得好。但是，他下乡视察时，看到在县里和乡里同中央不一样。有的乡干部没有文化，不知道统一战线政策，也不知道我国有多少民主党派。有的地方宗派主义非常浓厚，干部都是共产党员，有知识有文化的人却被放在一边。他还说，在县里，权力集中在中共县委，而县人民委员会的权却很小。
    蔡廷锴还谈到了民革联系社会人士工作中的困难，以及关于民主党派内部矛盾的问题。
      冯宾符：
    上下探索知己
    遇到冷冷冰冰
    冯宾符说，民主促进会是一个以中学教师为重点的党派，从大多数成员的情况来看，他们的地位已经起了根本的变化，但他们在精神上和内心里似乎还要求有所寄托，“士为知己者死”的传统观念在许多成员的思想中还很深。他们上下探索“知己”使自己的魂魄有所安。他说，据我看来，这些人有很多愿意引共产党为“知己”的，因此，对于某些党员生硬的作风，冷冰冰的态度是特别敏感的。他希望针对知识分子的这些特点来帮助他们会有更大的收获。他还希望统战部帮助民进做好基层组织工作。他说，近来有些会员感到加入民进组织以后，与入会前好像没有什么区别，没有得到更多的帮助；个别会员反映，长此下去要退会了。他希望统战部帮助民进解决这个问题。
      黄药眠：
    党员不对也对
    非党员对也不对
    黄药眠在谈到党与非党的关系时说，当前最重要的缺点是党与非党的关系搞得很不好。他认为，有些事党员不对也认为是对的，非党员对的也认为是不对的。党员可以一年提升三级，非党员尽管勤勤恳恳工作，三、五年也不能升一级。党员犯错误关起门来在党内检讨，只要不受组织处分，依然有权在手。非党员犯错误，党组织对他很少教育、帮助，一方面任其自流，另一方面就开始对这个人作组织处理。
    他说，有些学校领导人怕和教师群众见面，专门坐在办公室听党、团员的汇报，造成部分群众怕和党、团员接触。还有部分党员恃功骄傲，有特权思想，不甚读书，靠党吃饭，口谈马列主义，而不肯刻苦钻研。他说这次整风实在是十分必要的。
    黄药眠还对统战部的工作提出了批评。他说，统战部接触面不广，过去大家对统战部批评过，统战部自己也作了自我批评，但批评以后依然未改，颇有“诚恳接受，坚决不改”的神气。其次，统战政策到了省级就很难推动。有些党员对于统战政策根本不了解或者了解得很庸俗。第三、统战部对民主党派的专职干部缺少关心，缺乏教育、培养、提升的整套计划，没有给予他们一定的地位。黄药眠建议：（一）现在形势改变了，许多过去的做法都应该加以重新考虑；（二）共产党内要加强对统战政策的宣传和学习，同时对“长期共存、互相监督”方针应订出一套制度和办法加以保证；（三）有些机关单位，如文化教育部门应把行政领导放在共产党的与非党的负责人组成的行政会议上；（四）各民主党派的基层组织在各机关单位应有一定的地位；（五）在党所指示的方针下，党与非党应站在平等的基础上，互相竞赛，有功则赏，有过则罚。有能力的应升迁，无能力的、不称职的应降级。
      李纯青：
    希望统战部不要看不起台盟
    李纯青在书面发言中提出了几点希望。他说，最近我们决定要发展组织。打算在天津、南京、武汉、福建四个地方建立新机构。希望得到有关地方统战部的帮助。他又说，几年来，从日本回国的华侨有几千人，其中一半以上是台湾同胞。他们的家庭、亲戚、朋友都在台湾，不回台湾而回大陆，这是热爱祖国的表现。台盟准备在台湾籍华侨中发展组织，进行工作。希望得到侨委会的帮助。从去年开始，有些台湾青年逃回大陆来，今后可能会越来越多。希望有关方面把这件事情作为一个特殊问题，安排他们的工作，给予温暖的照顾。
    李纯青最后说，过去台盟提到统战部的问题，往往一拖再拖，排不上日程。我不敢说统战部有官僚主义，因为台盟的事太小了。不过，在统战部看是小事，在台盟可是大事。希望统战部同志思想上不要看不起台盟。
    座谈会将继续举行。
