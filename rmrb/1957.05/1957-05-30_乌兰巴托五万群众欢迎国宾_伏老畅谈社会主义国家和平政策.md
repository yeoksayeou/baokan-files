Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 29th: More than 50,000 people in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, gathered at Sukhbaatar Square on the afternoon of the 29th to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.

Voroshilov delivered a long speech to the crowd filling the square. He said that the meeting with the working masses of Ulaanbaatar was unforgettable. Talking about his visits to China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, he said that they had personally witnessed the heroic labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people, who are successfully completing the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan. He expressed his belief that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will soon build a country with strong industry and highly developed agriculture.

He said that the people in the countries they visited all loved the Soviet people, and it was clear how much the people love peace.

He said that the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have made great efforts to ease international tensions, and their peace policy has been welcomed and supported by the people of the world. As long as the people of all countries cooperate in friendship and jointly struggle to ease international tensions, peace will surely prevail. He believes that Mongolia has made many contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

He said that the socialist camp, built on the principles of proletarian internationalism, is a powerful force for striving for the happiness of the people of all countries and world peace. The people of all countries must be vigilant and smash the sabotage plots of imperialism.

Prime Minister Tsedenbal thanked the Soviet Union for its assistance to Mongolia on behalf of the Mongolian people and thanked Voroshilov for his guidance.

Batdzargal, Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the Ulaanbaatar City Labor People's Hural, announced at the meeting that, according to the demands of the people, the Presidium of the Executive Bureau had decided to make Voroshilov an honorary citizen of Ulaanbaatar. At this moment, the whole audience cheered. Voroshilov said that he would guarantee to be a good citizen and do everything possible to safeguard world peace.

In the evening, Voroshilov held a banquet to entertain Mongolian party and government leaders and foreign diplomatic envoys.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 29th: On May 28th, Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Sambu, Tsedenbal, Damba, and others, visited the pastoral production cooperative, state-owned farm, and stud farm in the Central Province of Mongolia. Dozens of male and female herders from the cooperative rode horses to welcome Voroshilov three miles away from the cooperative.

That morning, the sky was clear and the air was fresh. Voroshilov and his entourage arrived at the Zamut Pastoral Cooperative at about eleven o'clock. Representatives of the cooperative members presented Voroshilov with hada and offered milk. Voroshilov said to the herders gathered on the lawn that he extended brotherly greetings to the herders on behalf of the Soviet people. He said that he had said that the Chinese people are heroic and hardworking people, and so are the Mongolian people.

Voroshilov said that it was very good for you to take the road of collectivization, and you are the workers in Mongolia's main economic sector, and you should better demonstrate to the individual herders. He said that the socialist people must work well in order to live well; and when life is good, labor will be more enjoyable.

The cooperative members gave Voroshilov a pair of newborn camels as souvenirs. Voroshilov said that he accepted the gift, but the little camels still need their mother to raise them, and he will come to get them when they grow up.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 29th: Chairman Voroshilov visited Choibalsan University today and spoke to more than two thousand students.

The university students lined up to welcome Voroshilov. Voroshilov told the students that before the victory of the revolution, Mongolia had no schools, but now it has trained senior technicians and experts. He said that because you have your own national intellectuals, it is of great significance to promote the development of Mongolian culture.

In his speech, Voroshilov said that Mongolia has abundant mineral resources, and pastoral production needs water sources, so he asked the students to study geology and water conservancy in order to better develop Mongolia's economy. He also encouraged the students to study Marxist-Leninist theory and serve the motherland.

Voroshilov donated two thousand books to the university.

Zevigmied, President of Choibalsan University, welcomed Voroshilov on behalf of the teachers and students of Mongolian universities. He said that Choibalsan University was established with the help of the Soviet Union, and has trained more than 1,000 people in the past fifteen years. The development of Mongolian culture is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union.

Voroshilov visited the laboratories and classrooms. He was very interested in the displayed biological specimens.

Voroshilov also met with Soviet experts at the Lenin Club today. Voroshilov asked the experts to help Mongolia train technical personnel, and also asked the experts to learn from the Mongolian people.

Voroshilov asked the Soviet children who presented flowers to him if they understood Mongolian. He told the Soviet children to learn Mongolian.
