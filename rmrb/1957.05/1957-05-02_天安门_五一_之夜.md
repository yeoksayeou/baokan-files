Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Millions of lights illuminated Tiananmen Square, and thousands of people crowded in front of the Jinshui Bridge, their eyes fixed on the center of Tiananmen Gate where red lanterns hung. Someone, overcome with excitement, jumped up and shouted, "Chairman Mao and Elder Fu are here to celebrate with us!" Immediately, applause thundered, and people became animated.

Dozens of searchlights pierced the dark night with their powerful beams. In front of Tiananmen Gate, fireworks and strings of firecrackers soared into the sky. Some "old Beijingers" pointed to the beautiful fireworks in the sky and said to their companions: This is "Peacocks Spreading Their Tails," that is "Butterflies Playing with Stars"... The joyous crowd stretched for four or five *li* from Tiananmen Square to East and West Chang'an Avenue. On this area of more than 130,000 square meters, people rubbed shoulders, dancing and leaping to the music from the loudspeakers.

Looking down from the tall buildings on Tiananmen Square, strings of carp lanterns swam back and forth in the sea of people. After a while, folk red lantern dances and lion dances appeared, and the surging tide of joy rose one after another.

Guests from dozens of countries watched the fireworks from the viewing platform tonight. Seeing the beautiful Beijing festive night sky and the jubilant crowd, they were so excited that they cheered constantly.

Late into the night, people were still immersed in the joy of the "May Day" night.

    天安门“五一”之夜
    据新华社1日讯　千万盏灯光照耀着天安门广场，成千上万的人挤向金水桥前，眼睛望着天安门上挂红灯的正中间。不知是谁激动得跳起来高喊：“毛主席陪着伏老也来和我们一起狂欢啦！”顿时，掌声响成一片，人们活跃起来。
    几十支探照灯的巨大光柱揭开了漆黑的夜幕。在天安门前，礼花弹和连珠花腾空而起。一些“老北京”指着空中美丽的礼花对伙伴说：这是“孔雀开屏”，那是“群蝶闹星”……。欢乐的人流从天安门广场向东、西长安街延伸了四、五华里。在这十三万多平方公尺的地面上，人们肩擦着肩，随着扩音器送出的乐曲，跳跃起舞。
    从天安门广场的高大建筑物上望去，成串的鲤鱼灯，在人的海洋中游来游去。一会儿，又出现了民间的红灯舞、狮子舞，欢腾的浪潮此起彼伏。
    来自好几十个国家的客人们今晚在观礼台上观赏礼花。他们看到美丽的北京节日夜空和狂欢的人群，激动得不断欢呼。
    夜深了，人们依然沉浸在“五一”之夜的欢乐中。
