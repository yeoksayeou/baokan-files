Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 19th: Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage left Jakarta at 8:15 this morning on a Tu-104 jet.

At Jakarta Airport, Chairman Voroshilov delivered a farewell speech to President Sukarno and the Indonesian people, saying that during his visit to Indonesia, he saw that the Indonesian people loved their motherland and were ready to fight to defend their national independence and freedom. He said he believed that the friendship between the Indonesian and Soviet people was solid and unbreakable. He thanked President Sukarno and the Indonesian people for their warm hospitality towards him and the delegation members.

President Sukarno said in an emotional tone that, based on common ideals, the friendly and fraternal feelings of the Indonesian people towards the Soviet people would not change. He said that due to scientific achievements and the invention of jet aircraft, the distance between the two countries had been shortened, but the common thoughts and feelings of mankind would bring the two countries even closer. The Indonesian people would think of the ideals and feelings of the Soviet people, as well as their struggle for a happy life, every moment, every minute, every second. Sukarno wished Voroshilov good health, a safe journey for him and his entourage, and a prosperous and happy life for the Soviet people.

Voroshilov shook hands with the Indonesian military and political leaders present to bid farewell. The crowd waved the flags of both countries and shouted, "Long live peace and friendship!" "Long live Voroshilov!"

Before boarding the plane, Voroshilov and Sukarno repeatedly shook hands warmly, hugged tightly, and reluctantly parted.

After a 21-gun salute, Voroshilov's plane sped down the runway. Voroshilov and his party, full of friendship, left Indonesia after a thirteen-day stay.
