    The more than five thousand people of Taipei yesterday, in a surge of anger, destroyed the embassy of the American aggressors stationed in Taipei. Upon hearing this news, the people of the entire nation felt admiration for the national integrity displayed by the people of Taiwan, and at the same time expressed deep concern for their plight in the dire straits under the oppression of the US-Chiang regime.
    The American aggressors forcibly occupy our territory of Taiwan with military force, treating the people of Taiwan as if they were mere grass, livestock, and horses, and trampling on them at will. The case of Sergeant Reynolds of the US Military Advisory Group in Taiwan shooting and killing Liu Ziran is only one of the countless crimes committed by the American military in Taiwan. The American military court in Taipei, after Reynolds killed the man, actually announced his acquittal and release. This all the more clearly exposes the brutality and arrogance of the American aggressors, as well as their face as slave owners in Taiwan. The people of Taiwan, with their national self-esteem and glorious tradition of opposing foreign aggression, cannot tolerate this life of slavery. They rose up to destroy the aggressors' embassy, which shows that they have reached the end of their forbearance and cannot but resist. The patriotic people of Taiwan are unyielding.
    The reason why the American aggressors are able to run rampant and defy the law in Taiwan, turning this beautiful land of our country into a dark and bleak world, is due to the traitorous actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In order to prolong their lives in a corner of the motherland, this clique does not hesitate to lead wolves into the house, allowing the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan and run rampant there. Now, the American aggressors have gradually deepened their presence in Taiwan, and recently dispatched missile units to be stationed there in order to turn Taiwan into their atomic base. At the same time, the United States is constantly spreading news of implementing "trusteeship" over Taiwan. This means that the American aggressors want to nakedly turn Taiwan into their own territory.
    Every patriot in Taiwan should see that under the oppression of the United States, even a life worse than that of livestock is not guaranteed; even the fate of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which attempts to preserve itself by betraying the country, is precarious. If the people of Taiwan want to see the light of day again and live a free and happy life again, the only way is to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. The people of Taiwan should join the people of the whole country, make persistent efforts, and work together to liberate Taiwan.

### 台湾人民不可屈

    台湾人民不可屈
    台北五千多名群众昨日在激愤之下，捣毁了驻在台北的美国侵略者的大使馆。消息传来，全国人民都对台湾人民所表现的民族正气感到敬佩，同时对他们在美蒋压迫下的水深火热的处境表示深切的关怀。
    美国侵略者用武力霸占着我国的领土台湾，把台湾人民视如草芥牛马，随意加以蹂躏。驻在台湾的美国军事顾问团的上士雷诺枪杀刘自然事件，只不过是美国军队在台湾所犯下的无数罪行中的一件而已。台北的美国军事法庭在雷诺杀人后竟宣布把他无罪开释。这就更加清楚地暴露了美国侵略者的残暴和跋扈，以及他们在台湾以奴隶主自居的面目。有着民族自尊心和反对外国侵略的光荣传统的台湾人民，是不能忍受这种奴隶生活的。他们群起捣毁侵略者的大使馆，这表明他们已忍无可忍，不能不进行反抗了。爱国的台湾人民是不可屈服的。
    美国侵略者所以能够在台湾如此横行不法，把我国的这一块美丽国土变成暗无天日的世界，这是蒋介石集团的卖国行为所招来的。这个集团为了要在祖国的一隅苟延残喘，不惜引狼入室，让美国侵略者侵占着台湾，并在那里横行不法。现在，美国侵略者在台湾已一步步深入，最近并派遣了导弹部队驻在那里，以便把台湾变成它的原子基地。与此同时，美国还不断传出要对台湾实行“托管”的消息。这就是说，美国侵略者要赤裸裸地把台湾变成自己的属地。
    在台湾的每一个爱国者都应当看出，在美国的压迫下就连牛马不如的生活也是毫无保障的；甚至那些企图卖国自保的蒋介石集团的命运也是朝不保夕的。台湾人民要重见天日，重过自由幸福的生活，只有使台湾重新回到祖国的怀抱。台湾人民应当同全国人民在一道，再接再厉，为解放台湾而共同努力。
