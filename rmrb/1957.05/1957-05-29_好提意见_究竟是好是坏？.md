Is “Being Good at Giving Opinions” Actually Good or Bad?
Special Invited Member of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Zhengfei

Correctly handling contradictions among the people is everyone's business, the business of 600 million people across the country. Not only should everyone speak up, but everyone has a responsibility. Therefore, today I want to raise two conflicting issues for discussion at this conference:

        First, the contradictory issue of unity and attitude.

The Party's policy is to "unite all forces that can be united." In dealing with ideological issues, we are required to adopt an attitude of "curing the sickness to save the patient, and being kind to others." However, some places have problems in their attitude towards old intellectuals, former military and political personnel, capitalists, and former landlords and rich peasants who have already reformed. I summarize it as having two attitudes: One type of person adopts an attitude of "inviting them, but also rejecting them." The manifestations of this attitude are coldness, suspicion, incompatibility, turning a blind eye, unnatural conversations, and unpleasantness. Another type of person adopts an attitude of "wanting to give to them, but first hitting them." Some say, "This is the Party testing him." I say, this is like Person A insisting on slapping Person B in the face today before being willing to give him four ounces of pork tomorrow; or, giving a slap in the face today as a test, and then deciding whether to give Person B four ounces of pork tomorrow. I believe that if a slap in the face is not given today, and only one and a half ounces of pork are given tomorrow, would Person B feel happier than receiving four ounces of pork? There is also a classic example, the so-called "kicking it and giving it, a beggar will not take it." Naturally, if you kick someone first and then give them something, even a beggar will not want it.

Therefore, I believe that at the very least, we should adopt an attitude of "since they have come, let them be at ease." But strictly speaking, even this attitude is passive. It is better to adopt an attitude of "since we are close to them, hold them tight." As long as leading comrades at all levels of the Party can do this when actively uniting the masses.

      Second, is "being good at giving opinions" actually good or bad?

Here, I am not discussing the issue of "whether the content of the opinion is correct," but specifically discussing whether "being good at giving opinions" as a personality, habit, and style is a shortcoming or an advantage.

In the winter of 1953, at a gathering in the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, I heard the head of the Personnel Section of the General Office announce: "Many demobilized soldiers have been transferred to Taiyuan. Some units in Taiyuan believe that soldiers are good at giving opinions and don't want them. Now we must correct this mistake." I was shocked at the time. I thought, "Glorious soldiers are not wanted because they are good at giving opinions; I am a former soldier, and I am also good at giving opinions, so what future do I have?" Then, I thought, "If being good at giving opinions is a shortcoming, I should discard it; if being good at giving opinions is an advantage, I should insist on it."

Now, I will present my research and analysis of this issue over the past three or four years:

First, let me state: "Not being good at giving opinions" is not necessarily a shortcoming. Don't simply label it as "individualism."

      "Opinions" are the product of mental labor. Only through arduous mental labor is it possible to produce relatively good opinions.

      The theoretical basis of "being good at giving opinions" is fundamentally the mass line from bottom to top. It is a relatively concentrated form with guiding and pioneering effects in the mass line. The fundamental spirit of the Party's policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is to ask everyone to offer more opinions.

      The psychological basis of "being good at giving opinions" is courage and a sense of responsibility. This is a concrete manifestation of paying attention to and caring about the human world, national affairs, and social issues in all aspects. Being upright, frank, sensitive, thoughtful, expressing opinions whenever one has them, and saying what one thinks are personality reflections of "being good at giving opinions." Speaking frankly and honestly, disregarding personal gains and losses, and putting personal praise and criticism aside are the style of "being good at giving opinions."

      "Being good at giving opinions" should be said to be the objective requirement of the laws of social development. Transforming society and transforming the world both require "being good at giving opinions." Everyone who wants to progress also needs "being good at giving opinions" to help them. Therefore, the essence of "being good at giving opinions" is to love helping others overcome shortcomings and progress faster, and to love promoting society to move away from backwardness and towards progress.

      The development history and practical significance of "being good at giving opinions." The regimes of past dynasties and today's people's regime are essentially different, and I don't want to say more about that here. However, they have something in common in terms of opening up channels for speech. In our country, since the Zhou Dynasty, the officials of various dynasties, such as imperial historians, observation historians, remonstrating officials, poetry collecting officials, remonstrating grand masters, grand censors, supervisors, and supervisory committee members and supervisors, were generally those who dared to give opinions or were "good at giving opinions." Today, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led the people of the whole country into a new era of democracy, further opening up channels for speech and trying every possible means to encourage people to break their concerns and offer more opinions.

      What is the relationship between "being good at giving opinions" and "virtue" and "talent"? I believe that as long as one stands on the people's stand, "being good at giving opinions" is "virtue," because one pays attention to and cares about the people's cause in all aspects. As long as one is good at analyzing problems and putting forward opinions that are beneficial to the people, "being good at giving opinions" is "talent." Sima Qian said: "The 'yes' of a thousand men is not as good as the 'no' of one scholar." This sentence, although it exaggerates somewhat by comparing a thousand to one, as long as it is not said in reverse, as long as it is not a one-to-one comparison, then the talent of a scholar who says "no" must be a little higher than the talent of those who say "yes." Mencius said: "If a state has no legalists and counselors at home, and no enemy states abroad, it will perish." "Legalists and counselors" are internal conditions, and "enemy states" are external conditions. Therefore, "legalists and counselors" should be more important than "enemy states." In today's words, a country's internal affairs should especially value those cadres who "abide by the law without wavering" and "dare to speak out without yielding," and the more the better. Wei Zheng bravely dared to remonstrate with Tang Taizong, and submitted more than two hundred memorials, so that Taizong could not help but respect and fear him. Today, the evaluation of Tang Taizong is very high, which also reflects the objective value of Wei Zheng's more than two hundred criticisms and suggestions from the bottom up.

Chairman Mao said: "Those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should take warning." Some people say: "Those who speak should be rewarded." But in reality, some units do not want people who are "good at giving opinions." It is said that some leading comrades are afraid of opinions and therefore do not welcome people who are "good at giving opinions." Doesn't this prove that "those who speak are guilty"?

Therefore, I hope that the leadership will clearly affirm whether this personality, habit, and style of "being good at giving opinions" is a shortcoming or an advantage. If it is finally determined to be a "shortcoming," then let those who are "good at giving opinions" quickly discard it; if, on the other hand, it is finally determined that "being good at giving opinions" is an "advantage," then let those who are "good at giving opinions" get rid of the unfortunate situation of "those who speak are guilty" as soon as possible.

### “好提意见”究竟是好是坏？

    “好提意见”究竟是好是坏？
    政协山西省委员会特邀委员　张正非
    正确处理人民内部的矛盾，是大家的事情，是全国六万万人民的事情，不仅是人人要说话，而且是人人有责任。因此，我今天要提出两个矛盾问题，在大会上来讨论：
        第一，关于团结态度的矛盾问题
    党的政策方针，是要“团结一切可能团结的力量”。在对待思想问题上，要求采取“治病救人、与人为善”的态度。但是，有些地方在对待已经转变了的旧知识分子、旧军政人员、资本家以及过去的地主和富农的态度上有问题。我把它归纳起来，有过这样两种态度：有一种人，是采取“既招之，又拒之”的态度。这种态度的表现形式，是冷淡，怀疑，格格不入，转头而过，交谈不自然，触目不顺眼。另有一种人，是采取“欲与之，先殴之”的态度。有人说，“这是党对他的考验。”我说，这好比是甲要乙今天先接受一个耳光，明天才肯给他吃四两猪肉；或者是，今天先打一个耳光来考验考验，然后决定明天是否给乙四两猪肉吃。我认为，如果今天不打一个耳光，明天只给乙一两半猪肉吃，乙是否会感到比吃四两猪肉更加愉快呢。还有一个古典的例子，就是所谓“蹴而与之，乞人有所不取”。自然，如果先踢他一脚，再给他东西，就是要饭的人也是不会要的。
    因此，我认为，起码应该采取“既来之，使安之”的态度。但严格分析起来，像这样的态度还是消极的，不如采取“既亲之，紧抱之”的态度。只要各级党的领导同志，在主动团结群众时，就可以这样做。
      第二，“好提意见”究竟是好是坏？
    这里，不讨论“意见内容是否正确”的问题，专门讨论“好提意见”这一种性格、习惯和作风，究竟是缺点，还是优点的问题。
    1953年冬季，我在山西省人民政府里一个集会上，听到办公厅人事科科长宣布说：“有很多复员军人转业到太原来，太原市有些单位认为军人好提意见，不要。现在要纠正这种错误。”我在当时就大吃一惊。认为：“光荣的军人因好提意见，别人不要；我是一个旧军人，又好提意见，还有什么前途呢？”随后，我又想：“如果好提意见是缺点，我就应该把它丢掉；如果好提意见是优点，我就应该坚持不放。”
    现在，把我三、四年来对这一问题的研究分析，提出来谈一谈：
    首先声明：“不好提意见”不一定是缺点。不要简单地把它扣上“个人主义”的帽子。
      “意见”是脑力劳动的产物。只有经过脑力的艰苦劳动，才有可能产生比较好的意见。
      “好提意见”的理论基础，基本上是由下而上的群众路线。它是群众路线中比较集中的带有主导和先锋作用的形态。党提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“长期共存、互相监督”的方针的根本精神，就是要求大家多提意见。
      “好提意见”的心理基础是勇敢和责任感。这是对人类世界和国家大事以及社会问题处处留意，事事关心的具体表现。正直、坦率、敏感、好思，有见必发，有啥说啥，是“好提意见”的性格反映。谠论直言，不计利害，置个人的褒贬于度外，是“好提意见”的风格。
    “好提意见”应该说是社会发展规律的客观要求。改造社会和改造世界都需要“好提意见”。每一个人想进步，也需要“好提意见”来帮助。因此，“好提意见”的本质，就是喜爱帮助别人克服缺点，快些进步，就是喜爱推动社会离开落后，走向进步。
      “好提意见”的发展历史及其现实意义。过去各个朝代的政权与今天人民的政权，有本质上的不同，在此不想多说。但在开放言路这一点上，却有共同之处。我国自周朝起，历代先后出现的御史、观风史、谏官、采诗官、谏议大夫、都御史、肃政史及监察委员、监察史之类，一般说就是那些敢于提意见或“好提意见”的人充任的。今天中国共产党和毛主席把全国人民引入崭新的民主时代，更是大开言路，并想尽一切办法，鼓励人们打破顾虑，多提意见。
      “好提意见”和“德”与“才”的关系是怎样的呢？我认为：只要站在人民的立场上，“好提意见”就是“德”；因为他对人民的事业，处处留意，事事关心。只要能善于分析问题，提出与人民有利的意见，“好提意见”就是“才”。司马迁说：“千人之诺诺，不如一士之谔谔”。这一句话，尽管是以千比一，扩大了一些，只要不是说反了，只要不是一比一，那末，谔谔之士的才，总要比那些诺诺之人的才高一点吧。孟轲说：“入则无法家拂士，出则无敌国外患者国恒亡。”“法家拂士”是内在的条件，“敌国外患”是外在的条件，因此，“法家拂士”应该比“敌国外患”重要得多。拿今天的话来说，就是一个国家的内部，应该特别重视那些“守法不移”和“谏诤不屈”的干部，而且是越多越好。魏征勇于对唐太宗犯颜敢谏，而且凡上二百余奏，使太宗不能不敬惮。今天对唐太宗的评价很高，也反映出魏征先后提出二百多次自下而上的批评和建议的客观价值。
    毛主席说：“言者无罪，闻者足戒”。有些人说：“言者有赏”。可是在实际上，“好提意见”的人，有些单位不要。据说有些领导同志害怕提意见，因而不欢迎“好提意见”的人。这不是都证明“言者有罪”了吗？
    因此，我希望领导上把“好提意见”这一种性格、习惯和作风，究竟是缺点，还是优点，明确肯定起来。如果，最后判定这是“缺点”，那末，可以让“好提意见”的人赶快把它丢掉；倘使，最后判定“好提意见”是“优点”，那末，也可以让“好提意见”的人早日摆脱“言者有罪”的不幸遭遇。
