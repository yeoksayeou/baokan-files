U.S. Troops Get Out of Taiwan!
The Entire Class 2, Grade 3, Political Education Program, Beijing Normal University

After reading the People's Daily's report on the patriotic anti-American struggle bravely waged by our compatriots in Taiwan, we were filled with excitement. U.S. imperialism has forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, plunging eight million compatriots into a pit of suffering. Their atrocities over the years have been countless, and recently they have unjustly murdered our compatriot Liu Ziran. We are infinitely indignant about this! The suffering of our Taiwan compatriots is the suffering of all Chinese people. We firmly support the heroic patriotic anti-American struggle launched by our Taiwan compatriots. Our Taiwan compatriots, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, cannot be bullied, and the will of all Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will never waver.

We also strongly protest the Taiwan authorities' use of military suppression against their own compatriots' patriotic struggle. We believe that this practice of turning against relatives to side with the enemy is not so much a means of protecting their own interests as it is a means of burying themselves. The Central People's Government has long issued a call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Chiang's officers and soldiers should clear their heads, return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, and jointly build an independent and prosperous new China.

Finally, we shout: U.S. troops get out of Taiwan! We fully support the heroic patriotic anti-American struggle of our Taiwan compatriots!

    美军从台湾滚出去！
    北京师范大学政治教育专业三年级二班全体同学
    我们看了人民日报关于台湾同胞奋起进行爱国反美斗争的报道以后，热血沸腾了。美帝国主义武力强占我国领土台湾，使八百万同胞陷于水深火热之中，几年来暴行累累，最近又无辜杀害我同胞刘自然，对此我们无限愤慨！台湾同胞的苦难，就是全中国人民的苦难，台湾同胞所掀起的英勇的爱国反美斗争，我们坚决的支持。有着光荣革命传统的台湾同胞是不可欺侮的，全中国人民解放台湾的意志是决不会动摇的。
    我们也强烈地抗议台湾当局对于自己同胞这种爱国斗争所采取的军事镇压手段。我们认为这种背亲向敌的做法，与其说是保护自己的利益，不如说是埋葬自己的手段。中央人民政府早就发出和平解放台湾的号召，蒋方官兵应该清醒头脑，早日回到祖国怀抱，共同建设独立、富强的新中国。
    最后我们高呼：美军从台湾滚出去！我们全力支持台湾同胞爱国反美的英勇斗争！
