The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions on the participation of leading cadres at all levels in physical labor. It requires cadres at the county, district, and township levels, the main leading cadres of Party committees at and above the county level, and the main Party cadres working in government and people's organizations, including members of the Party Central Committee, to devote a portion of their time each year to participate in some physical labor, provided they are capable of doing so. It also calls for minimizing the number of personnel detached from production in grassroots organizations wherever possible. This is an important method for carrying forward our Party's tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and hard work, and for rectifying the Party's ideological style. Whether or not this instruction of the Party Central Committee can be thoroughly implemented is a major test of whether communists can strive for the Party's general task under new historical conditions.

Everyone knows that our country has now entered a period of socialist construction. What we have done and are doing is a world-shaking event in human history. We have overthrown the rule of the exploiting classes. We cannot allow any restoration of the exploiting classes, nor can we allow the ideology of the exploiting classes to corrode our working class and other laboring people and its members.

All exploiting classes throughout history have regarded labor as a lowly thing and laborers as inferior people. We communists are fundamentally opposed to all exploiters. We regard labor as the noblest and most glorious thing, and laborers as the most meritorious and most worthy of respect in human society. Engels once wrote: "Labor is indeed, next to nature, the source of all wealth. Nature provides labor with materials, which it transforms into wealth; but labor is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that labor created man himself." This is the communist's fundamental evaluation of labor. The broad masses of the people now understand clearly that only labor creates mankind, human history, and culture. The entire history of mankind is mainly the history of the direct producers of material wealth.

In the years since the victory of the revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of our country have displayed high labor enthusiasm and initiative, rapidly restored and developed the national economy, and achieved significant accomplishments in various construction undertakings. However, the exploiting classes have not been completely eliminated, and the ideology of the exploiting classes still remains in the minds of many people. Therefore, the bad habit of looking down on physical labor from the old society has not been completely eradicated. Many people always think that mental labor is superior to physical labor, and they treat these two types of labor as opposing each other, thinking that those who have learned culture should no longer do physical labor, and those who do physical labor do not need to learn culture. Some young men and women who have learned a little culture feel that they are superior to ordinary laborers and should enjoy much higher treatment than laborers. Many young students still receive very little education about labor, training through labor, and inspiration from the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people. Some students are very unhappy when they hear that they will participate in physical labor after graduation, and even think that participating in labor has no "future." Many of their parents also hold the same attitude and view towards physical labor.

In our revolutionary ranks, there are also some comrades who, as pointed out in the Central Committee's instructions, have been influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes of the old society, have forgotten the glorious tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and working hard, and have developed a bad mentality of greed for fame, profit, and position. They used to live among the laboring people during the revolutionary war period and helped the masses with plowing, weeding, harvesting, fetching water, and chopping firewood, but now they rarely do so. They often live among piles of documents and become detached from the masses and from reality. Some comrades do not strive for progress in their work, do not strive to get close to the masses, but haggle over wage grading, and strive to be "high-class" in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, becoming more and more distant from the living standards of workers and peasants. Some comrades are even unwilling for their children to participate in productive labor.

The Central Committee's instructions point out that all communists, regardless of their position or seniority, should, in principle, place themselves in the same and equal position as ordinary laborers. This Marxist viewpoint has nothing in common with the decadent viewpoint of the exploiting classes in the old society that despised physical labor. All communists must completely break with that decadent ideology of the exploiting classes. Otherwise, we cannot be regarded as thorough Marxists and true communists. And judging from the many phenomena mentioned earlier, we cannot but admit that the ideological viewpoints of the exploiting classes are still eroding and poisoning us. This situation must be resolutely changed.

The participation of leading cadres in physical labor will help fundamentally reverse people's wrong attitudes and views towards physical labor, help develop the class consciousness of the laboring people and a sense of "labor is glorious," a sense of pride, and will help change social customs. Our next generation will be cultivated into completely new types of people by new social customs. And as long as leading cadres who are capable of engaging in physical labor devote a portion of their time to participate in physical labor, forming a new social atmosphere, then the current phenomenon of a large number of personnel unnecessarily detached from production will also be fundamentally changed. In grassroots production units, construction units, and grassroots organizations of Party committees, governments, and people's organizations throughout the country, it is entirely possible to reduce the number of personnel detached from production, and many units and organizations may even be able to achieve no personnel detached from production. All personnel in these units who are unnecessarily detached from production and have already become detached from production should strive to return to production. This will not only reduce the burden on the people, but also strengthen the forces on the production front, which is of great benefit to our entire cause.

After leading cadres participate in physical labor, they will naturally be able to communicate with the laboring people because they are in constant contact with them. The problems that exist among the laboring people can therefore be more easily and regularly reflected to the leading organs and be resolved in a timely manner. This will greatly reduce bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and effectively improve leadership. The broad masses will trust the leading cadres more, and the contradictions between the leaders and the led will be likely to be handled more quickly and correctly. The cheer of "The land reform cadres are back again!" is a concentrated expression of this sentiment of the masses.

The fact that leading personnel of Party, government, and military departments in many places have recently begun to participate in physical labor has already proven the benefits of doing so. Several secretaries of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and other Party and government leaders participated in vegetable growing labor in agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Baoding City, and the cooperative members quickly told them about the hardship of low vegetable prices and the loss of money in growing vegetables. Party and government leaders in Shanxi Province participated in labor on construction sites in Taiyuan City and immediately heard the opinions of employees of construction companies on wage reform. Leading cadres in Henan Province participated in agricultural cooperative labor in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City and immediately heard the "heartfelt words" of cooperative members about the lack of transparency in the cooperative's economy and the undemocratic style of the cadres. Party and government leaders and senior military officers in other provinces and cities have all received similar effects from participating in physical labor.

All of these indicate that the participation of leading cadres in physical labor is not a trivial matter that is dispensable or optional, as some comrades think, but a major event that will have a positive effect on the socialist cause, and is of extremely important political significance. Of course, this activity must have a realistic and sustained arrangement and plan. Experience must be summarized at any time so that the organization of labor can be gradually rationalized. All formalism and "just a gust of wind" practices are wrong and must be avoided. We believe that all comrades in the Party will surely respond positively to the call of the Party Central Committee and prove their loyalty to the cause of the Party and the people with their own practical actions.

    领导人员参加体力劳动的重大意义
    中共中央发布的关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示，要求县区乡的干部，县级以上各级党委的主要领导人员，在政府和人民团体中工作的党的主要干部，包括党的中央委员在内，凡是能够参加体力劳动的，都应该每年抽出一部分时间参加一部分体力劳动；并且要求在基层组织中尽可能地减少脱离生产的人员。这是发扬我们党联系群众、艰苦奋斗的传统和整顿党的思想作风的一个重要的办法。能否彻底执行党中央的这个指示，这是在新的历史条件下共产党员能否为党的总任务而奋斗的一种重大的考验。
    谁都知道，我们的国家现在已经走进了社会主义建设的时期，我们已经做的和正在做的事情是人类历史上翻天复地的大事。我们已经推翻了剥削阶级的统治。我们不能容许任何剥削阶级的复辟，也不能容许剥削阶级的思想意识侵蚀我们的工人阶级和其他劳动人民的队伍和它的成员。
    从来的一切剥削阶级，都是把劳动看成下贱的事情，把劳动者看成下等人。我们共产党人同一切剥削者根本相反，我们把劳动看成最高尚最光荣的事情，把劳动者看成人类社会中功劳最大和最值得尊敬的人。恩格斯曾经写道：“劳动确实跟自然界一起是一切财富的源泉。自然界提供劳动以材料，而劳动把材料变成财富：但是劳动的意义还远不止于此。它是整个人类生活的第一个基本条件，并且是重要到如此地步，以至我们在某种意义上应该说：劳动创造了人本身。”这就是共产党人对劳动的根本估价。广大的人民现在都确切地了解，只有劳动才创造了人类，才创造了人类的历史和文化。整个人类的历史主要是物质财富的直接生产者的历史。
    我国人民在革命胜利以后的几年来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，发挥了高度的劳动热情和积极性，很快地恢复和发展了国民经济，并且在各种建设事业中取得了重大的成就。但是，剥削阶级还没有完全消灭，剥削阶级的意识还残留在许多人的头脑里，所以旧社会轻视体力劳动的恶劣风气，也还没有扫除干净。有不少人总以为体力劳动不如脑力劳动，并且把这两种劳动对立起来看待，以为学了文化就不应该再做体力劳动，做体力劳动的就不必学文化。有些青年男女多少学了一点文化，就觉得自己比一般劳动者高出一头，应当享受比劳动者高出很多的待遇。许多青年学生还很少受到劳动的教育、劳动的锻炼和劳动人民的思想感情的熏陶。有一些学生一听说毕了业要参加体力劳动，就非常不高兴，甚至认为参加劳动就没有了“前途”。他们的家长，也有许多对待体力劳动抱着同样的态度和看法。
    在我们革命的队伍中，也有一部分同志，如中央的指示所指出的，受了旧社会剥削阶级的思想影响，忘记了过去密切联系群众和艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，滋长了一种贪图名利地位的坏思想。他们过去在革命战争时期经常生活在劳动人民中间，并且帮助群众耕地、锄苗、收割、挑水和砍柴，现在却很少这样作了。他们经常生活在大堆文牍之中，而脱离群众，脱离实际。有些同志不在工作上力求进步，力求接近群众，却对于工资评级斤斤计较，并且在吃、穿、住、用等方面极力讲究“高级”，和工人、农民的生活水平越离越远。有的同志甚至也不愿意自己的子女参加生产劳动。
    中央的指示指出，一切共产党员，不论职位高低，资格新老，从原则上说，都应当把自己放在同普通劳动者一样的、同等的地位。这个马克思主义的观点，同旧社会剥削阶级鄙视体力劳动的腐朽观点没有任何可以调和之处。一切共产党员，都必须同那种腐朽的剥削阶级思想完全决裂。否则，我们就不能算作彻底的马克思主义者和真正的共产党人。而从前面的许多现象看来，我们却不能不承认剥削阶级的思想观点还在侵蚀着、毒害着我们。这种情形必须坚决改变。
    领导人员参加体力劳动将有助于从根本上扭转人们对体力劳动的错误态度和错误看法，有助于发展劳动人民的阶级自觉和“劳动光荣”感、自豪感，将有助于社会风尚的改变。我们的下一代人将由新的社会风尚陶冶成完全新型的人。而只要凡是能够从事体力劳动的领导人员抽出一部分时间参加体力劳动，形成一种新的社会风气，那末，目前大批人员不必要地脱离生产的现象，也将从根本上得到改变。在全国的基层生产单位、建设单位和党委、政府、人民团体的基层组织中，完全有可能减少脱离生产的人员，有许多单位和组织也有可能做到没有脱离生产的人员。在这些单位中的一切不必要脱离生产而已经脱离生产的人员应当争取回到生产中去。这样不但可以减轻人民负担，更可以增强生产战线上的力量，对我们的整个事业是大有好处的。
    领导人员参加体力劳动以后，经常同劳动人民保持接触，他们自然容易同劳动人民息息相通。劳动人民中所存在的问题，因此就能够比较容易经常地反映到领导机关中来，求得及时的解决。这就可以使我们大大减少官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，有效地改善领导。广大群众对领导人员将更加信任，领导和被领导之间的矛盾将有可能得到较迅速的和正确的处理。“土改干部又来了”的欢呼，就是群众的这种心情的集中表现。
    最近许多地方党、政、军的领导人员开始参加体力劳动的事实，已经证明了这样做的好处。河北省委的几位书记和其他党、政领导人员在保定市郊参加农业社的种菜劳动，社员们很快就把菜价偏低、种菜亏本的苦闷告诉了他们。山西省的党、政领导人员在太原市的工地上参加劳动，马上就听到了建筑公司职工对工资改革的意见。河南省的领导干部在郑州市郊参加农业社劳动，马上也就听到了社员们对于社内经济不公开和干部作风不民主的“知心话”。其他各省、市的党、政领导人员和部队的高级军官参加体力劳动都收到了类似的效果。
    所有这些，都说明领导人员参加体力劳动，并不像某些同志所想的那样是可有可无、可做可不做的小事，而是对于社会主义事业将发生积极作用的大事，是具有极其重大的政治意义的。当然，这种活动必须有实事求是和持久的安排和计划。必须随时总结经验，使劳动的组织逐步合理化。一切形式主义和“只是一阵风”的做法，都是不对的，都是必须避免的。我们相信全党同志一定能够积极响应党中央的号召，用自己的实际行动来证明自己对于党和人民的事业的忠诚。
