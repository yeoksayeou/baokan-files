The Fairyland of Penglai Exists on Earth

　　The season in Beijing is nearing the end of spring, but the spring atmosphere has been particularly strong these days. Yesterday was the 38th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. Over ten thousand youths from all walks of life in the capital held a garden party in Zhongshan Park to celebrate their glorious fighting festival with the heads of state of China and the Soviet Union.

　　Last night, Zhongshan Park transformed into a fairyland of Penglai. Amidst the green lawns, hundreds of flowers bloomed, vying for beauty. Deep yellow marigolds, colorful butterfly flowers, pink daisies, and various exotic flowers and plants wove together into vivid and beautiful floral carpets. Countless colored electric lights adorned the tall, verdant pines and cypresses, and the tender green branches of weeping willows and maple trees: red, blue, orange-yellow, green... When the evening breeze blew, these colored lights flickered and disappeared with the swaying of the branches. Many pavilions and towers in the park were also decorated with "outline bulbs," resembling crowns inlaid with pearls. On the Lingxing Gates surrounding the Altar of Land and Grain, four neon peace doves flapped their wings as if ready to fly into the transparent night sky. Young men and women wore their finest attire, some dressed as celestial fairies, others disguised as brothers and sisters from the border regions. Everything here was so magnificent and colorful!

　　At 8:10 PM, Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other national leaders, arrived at the garden party. Applause and cheers immediately erupted. The dense crowds, stretching from the entrance to the Altar of Land and Grain, were in a frenzy.

　　After the Soviet guests entered the park, the park's fantastical scenery immediately captivated them. Rashidov excitedly said to Yelyutin: "This park is decorated like a fairyland today." Voroshilov's son, arm in arm with his wife, also happily said, "It's just like a fairy tale; I really don't know what to look at, I can't bear to miss anything."

　　Chairman Mao accompanied the white-haired, silver-bearded, and energetic Voroshilov, walking slowly in front of the crowd, frequently waving to the masses. Thunderous applause and excited cheers shook the entire park. People were so joyful and excited because everyone knew that it was he, this old Soviet marshal, who had dedicated his entire youth to the cause of building and defending the Soviet motherland, and to the cause of defending world peace. Today, on this Chinese youth's fighting festival, he was able to come among us, share this happy evening with us, and sing and dance with us amidst this beautiful scenery and rare grand occasion. How could people not be excited and thrilled!

Unexpected Happiness

　　Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao returned to the central square of the Altar of Land and Grain from the west gate of the altar and entered the large circle of students from Tsinghua University. The students, full of dancing spirit, all surged forward. Chairman Mao said to Xu Yongxian, a female student in the third grade of the Department of Civil Engineering, "Dance with Comrade Voroshilov!" Xu Yongxian ran over, and Comrade Voroshilov immediately took her hand and started dancing. While dancing with her, Comrade Voroshilov asked something, and Xu Yongxian only understood one sentence: "Good?" She immediately replied, "Good!" After finishing a section, Xu Yongxian stepped back, jumping and hopping, and told the reporter: "I'm so happy, my heart is about to jump out."

　　After Comrade Voroshilov went out to dance, Ma Yuancai, a student from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, ran to Chairman Mao and said "Hello!" Chairman Mao also said "Hello!" and led her, following the rhythm of the music, to spin around in the crowded crowd. How much had Ma Yuancai dreamed of seeing Chairman Mao in the past? Today, not only did she see Chairman Mao, but she also had the happiness of dancing with her beloved leader. Taking advantage of this opportunity, she danced while carefully examining the radiant Chairman Mao, wanting to forever engrave the Chairman's image in her heart.

　　Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao left the square and went to the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to rest. The students were all very envious of Xu Yongxian and Ma Yuancai. Xie Tingyu, a student from the Department of Civil Engineering, and Yu Guoning, a student from the Department of Power Engineering, ran over to Comrade Liu Shaoqi and asked, "Can we go in and ask Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao to dance again?" Comrade Shaoqi said, "Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao are here to have fun with you young friends, go ahead!" With that, Comrade Shaoqi led them into the Zhongshan Hall. Chairman Mao said to them, "We'll rest for a while and come back soon." After a short while, Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao appeared in the square again. Xie Tingyu immediately went up to them, and Chairman Mao said to her with a smile, "We really came, didn't we!" So they danced with Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao again. Before leaving, Chairman Mao also asked Xie Tingyu, "Are you satisfied?" Xie Tingyu told the reporter: "We are all graduating this year, and we plan to respond to the Party's call and go to serve in the border areas. We will soon be far away from Chairman Mao. We never dreamed that we would have the opportunity to dance with Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao today. We are so happy!"

The Joyful "Children's World"

　　More than six hundred Chinese and Soviet children waited and waited in the western woods, waiting for the distinguished guests. Seeing that it was almost ten o'clock and the two Chairmen had not yet arrived, the children sent out "Hehe Erxian" (Two Immortals of Harmony and Union) to welcome them. The two little "fairies" said to the two Chairmen: "Two Chairmen, we are the Hehe Erxian sent by the Children's World. Would you please come and play with us?" These words invited the two Chairmen over!

　　As the distinguished guests approached the children's stage, a "little bird" chirped on a large cypress tree to the left of the road: "The distinguished guests are here!" A "little squirrel" next to it quickly followed up, waving its big tail and saying: "Hello, Chairman!" The "Tree Grandpa" on the big tree to the right of the road stroked his white beard that reached his feet and said: "The distinguished guests are here, children, quickly greet the distinguished guests!" At this time, two Young Pioneers - Soviet girl Galia and Chinese boy Shi Dinghuan presented flowers. The children jumped, rejoiced, and applauded, truly extremely happy!

　　Little announcers Wang Guangru and Sasha reported the program in Chinese and Russian, respectively. Comrade Voroshilov said to Chairman Mao: This pair of little announcers is arranged really well, look how well they cooperate! The wonderful and interesting "Pulling the Radish" made both Chairmen laugh. At this time, Comrade Peng Zhen suggested going to see other places, but Comrade Voroshilov said with a smile, "Don't go, let's watch a little longer." Comrade Voroshilov was attracted by the children's performance. Next up was the hoop dance performed by five Soviet girls. The five girls, holding white hoops and wearing pink satin dance costumes, danced gracefully and skillfully. Shi Dinghuan, who had presented flowers to the Chairman, sat next to Chairman Voroshilov all the time, while Galia sat on Comrade Peng Zhen's lap. Their happy, excited, and joyful little faces attracted the envious eyes of many children. The Chairmen also watched "Free Exercise" and the "Marzuka" dance before reluctantly leaving the children.

An Unforgettable Evening

　　Comrade Voroshilov was very interested in the arrangement and programs of the garden party. Whether it was the songs sung in Chinese and Russian by the university students at the Altar of Land and Grain, or Tong Shuwang's unique skills in playing the altar, or the Chinese classical dance performed in the western woods, or the puppet show "Little Cowherd" in the South Altar Gate area, all repeatedly won Comrade Voroshilov's applause and praise. While resting in the Zhongshan Hall, Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, paid tribute to Comrade Voroshilov on behalf of the students and youth of the capital. Comrade Voroshilov praised this wonderful evening to Hu Qili, saying: He had never seen such a good evening party in his life. It was not only rich and colorful but also orderly. He asked Yelyutin, the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, who was beside him, "Have you ever seen such an evening party in Moscow in the past?" Yelyutin said "No." Then, Comrade Voroshilov encouraged Chinese youth to study hard. Hu Qili said to Comrade Voroshilov: The great Soviet Union has always been a model for us to learn from.

　　At 10:30 PM, Comrade Voroshilov and Chairman Mao, etc., left Zhongshan Park amidst the cheers of the people. At this time, songs and dances continued in the park. Many people still thought that the two Chairmen had not left and were still waiting for them to return.

    友谊万岁！青春万岁！
    ——5月4日首都各界青年欢迎伏老游园大会侧记
    蓬莱仙境在人间
　　北京的时令已近暮春，但是这些天春意却特别浓郁。昨天是“五四”三十八周年。首都各界万余青年在中山公园举行游园晚会，同中苏两国元首一起欢度自己的这个光荣的战斗节日。
　　中山公园昨晚变成了蓬莱仙境。在茵绿的草地中间，百花盛开，争红斗妍。深黄的金盏，彩色缤纷的蝴蝶花，粉红的草菊和各种奇花异草，织成了一幅幅鲜艳美丽的花毯。在高挺的苍松翠柏上，在嫩绿满枝的龙爪槐和元宝枫树上，缀着数不清的彩色电灯：红的、蓝的、橙黄的、绿的……当晚风吹来的时候，这些彩灯随着树枝的摇动而若隐若现。园里的许多亭台楼阁，也按上了“勾边灯泡”，装饰得像一顶顶镶满了珍珠的皇冠。社稷坛四周的棂星门上，四只霓虹和平鸽，在透明的夜空中，振翅欲飞。男女青年们穿着最漂亮的衣装，有的打扮得像天上的仙女，有的化装成来自边疆的兄弟民族。这里的一切是多么绚丽多采啊！
    八时十分，伏罗希洛夫主席在毛主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理等国家领导人的陪同下来到游园晚会。掌声和欢呼声立即一起迸发出来。从大门口一直排到社稷坛的密密层层的人群沸腾起来了。
    苏联贵宾们进园以后，园中的奇幻的景色立刻吸引住了他们。拉希多夫向叶留金兴奋地说：今天这个公园布置的有如仙境。伏老的儿子挽着他爱人的臂，也高兴地说：“简直像神话一样，真不知道看什么好，什么也舍不得不看。”
    毛主席陪着白发银须、神采奕奕的伏老，在群众队伍前面，慢步走着，频频向群众招手。雷动的掌声，兴奋的欢呼声，震动着整个公园。人们这样欢乐、激动，是因为大家都知道，就是他，这位苏联老元帅，曾经把自己的全部青春，献给缔造和保卫苏维埃祖国的事业，献给保卫世界和平的事业。今天，在这中国青年的战斗的节日里，他能来到我们中间，和我们共同欢度这个幸福的夜晚，和我们一齐欢歌乐舞，对此良辰美景，对此难逢的盛会，人们怎能不兴奋和激动呢！
    意外的幸福
    伏老和毛主席从坛西门回到社稷坛的中央广场，走进清华大学学生的大圈子，舞兴正浓的同学们都涌过来。毛主席对土木系三年级的女同学徐永贤说：“跟伏老跳吧！”徐永贤跑过去，伏老马上拉着她的手跳起来。伏老一面跟她跳，一面问一些什么，徐永贤只听懂一句：“好不好？”她马上回答说：“好！”跳完了一节，徐永贤退下来，跳着蹦着，对记者说：“真高兴，我的心都快要跳出来了。”
    伏老出去跳舞之后，水利系同学马媛才就跑到毛主席跟前，说一声“您好！”毛主席也说“你好！”就带着她，跟着音乐的节奏，在拥挤的人群中旋转起来。马媛才过去曾经多么梦想见见毛主席啊，今天不但看到了毛主席，而且幸福地和亲爱的领袖在一起跳舞了。她趁着这个机会一面跳，一面仔细地端祥着容光焕发的毛主席，要把主席的印象永远铭刻在自己的心头。
    伏老和毛主席离开广场，进中山纪念堂休息去了。同学们都十分羡慕徐永贤和马媛才。土木系同学谢庭雩和动力系同学俞国宁跑过去问刘少奇同志：“我们可以进去请伏老和毛主席再跳一次舞么？”少奇同志说：“伏老和毛主席就是来和你们青年朋友玩的，去吧！”说着，少奇同志就带她们进中山堂。毛主席对她们说：“我们休息一下马上就来。”不多一会，伏老和毛主席又在广场出现了。谢庭雩立即迎上去，毛主席微笑着对她说：“我们真的来了吧！”于是她们又跟伏老和毛主席跳起舞来。临走的时候，毛主席还向谢庭雩说：“你们满足了吗？”谢庭雩告诉记者：“今年我们都要毕业了，我们打算响应党的号召，到边疆去服务，快要远离毛主席了，做梦也没有想到，今天能够有机会跟伏老和毛主席跳舞。我们真幸福！”
    欢乐的“儿童世界”
    六百多个中苏儿童在西边树林里等呀、等呀，等候着贵宾。眼看都快十点钟了还不见两位主席的到来。于是孩子们派出“和合二仙”前去迎接。两位小“仙女”向两位主席说：“两位主席，我们是儿童世界派来的和合二仙，请你们到我们那里去玩玩好吗？”一番话把两位主席请来了！
    贵宾们走近孩子们的舞台时，路旁左边的一棵大柏树上，一只“小鸟”叫起来了：“贵宾来了！”旁边的一只“小松鼠”甩着大尾巴赶紧接着说：“主席您好！”路右旁大树上的“树公公”摸着长到脚面的白胡子说：“贵宾们来了，孩子们，快向贵宾问好！”这时两个少先队员——苏联小姑娘珈莉亚和中国男孩子石定寰献了花。孩子们跳呀，乐呀，鼓掌呀，真是高兴极了！
    小报幕员王光如和萨沙分别用中文和俄文报告了节目。伏老向毛主席说：这一对小报幕员安排的真好，你看他们配合的多好啊！精彩有趣的拔萝卜把两位主席都逗笑了。这时彭真同志建议到别的地方再去看一看，伏老笑着说，别走，再看一会儿吧。伏老已被孩子们的表演吸引住了。紧接着是五个苏联小姑娘跳的藤圈舞。五个手拿白藤圈、身穿粉红色缎舞衣的小姑娘优美而熟练地跳着。给主席献过花的石定寰一直坐在伏罗希洛夫主席身边，而珈莉亚则坐在彭真同志的膝头上。他们幸福的、激动的、高兴的小脸，吸引着好多小朋友的羡慕的眼光。主席们又看了“自由体操”和“马茹卡”舞，才依依不舍地离开了孩子们。
    难忘的晚会
    伏老对游园晚会的布置、节目，都感到很大的兴趣。无论是社稷坛上大学生们用中俄文演唱的歌曲，或佟树旺的耍坛绝技，还是西树林中演出的中国古典舞或坛南门区的木偶剧“小放牛”，都一再地博得了伏老的掌声和赞赏。在中山堂休息的时候，全国学联主席胡启立代表首都的学生和青年向伏老致敬。伏老对胡启立赞誉了这个精采的晚会，他说：像今天这样好的晚会，他有生以来还是第一次见到。不但丰富多采，而且秩序井然。他问身旁的苏联高教部长叶留金：“你过去在莫斯科见过这样的晚会吗？”叶留金说“没有”。接着，伏老勉励中国青年好好学习。胡启立向伏老说：伟大的苏联始终是我们学习的榜样。
    十点半钟，伏老和毛主席等，在人们的欢呼声中离开了中山公园。这时，园中依然歌声不绝，舞影翩翩。很多人还以为两位主席并没有走，还等着他们再回来。　　　　　本报记者（附图片）
