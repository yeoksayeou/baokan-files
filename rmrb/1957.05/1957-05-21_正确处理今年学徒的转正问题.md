    Correctly Handle the Issue of Apprentices' Transition to Formal Worker Status This Year
    Last year, all departments and regions recruited a large number of apprentices (trainees). Some of them studied in enterprises and public institutions, while others studied in technical schools or technical training classes. According to the original plan, most of them were to be transferred to formal worker status this year. However, due to the slowdown in the pace of national construction this year, the number of new workers needed by various departments has been greatly reduced compared with the original plan, and the current apprentice system is not entirely reasonable. Therefore, the State Council recently issued a notice requiring all departments and provinces and cities to consider the issue of apprentices' transition to formal worker status based on production needs and the overall personnel balance of the departments and regions. If there is no need to supplement new workers, the existing apprentices should have their study period extended. Therefore, with the exception of a few industrial sectors, most apprentices will have their study period extended this year, but once the extended period expires, they will all be transferred to formal worker status after passing the skills test, with no further extensions.
    1956 was a year of unprecedented and enormous development in China's economic construction. However, under the situation of victorious development, there were also deviations of excessively large plans, and the scale and speed of construction actually exceeded the country's capabilities. Personnel training plans are an integral part of the overall construction plan. If the overall construction plan is too large, the personnel training plan will naturally be too large as well. The large-scale recruitment of apprentices last year was carried out under the guidance of such a plan. Taking the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry as an example, the enterprises under this ministry had only 8,000 apprentices in total in 1954 and 1955, but last year alone, this increased to 40,000, which is four times more than in the previous two years, which is obviously excessive.
    After a year of production and construction practice, and especially after the serious natural disasters last year, the agricultural production plan was not completed, which affected the state's financial revenue and the purchase of materials. Therefore, this year, the state had to adjust the plan in a timely manner and slow down the pace of construction; at the same time, a series of measures were taken to reverse the deviations of excessively large plans caused last year. Many enterprises that were planned to be built were suspended; some newly built enterprises that were originally scheduled to go into production this year also had to be slowed down or have their completion dates postponed due to investment cuts; and the production of existing enterprises also had to be reduced due to restrictions on the supply of raw materials. Our Party Central Committee has put forward the call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice thrift, requiring all departments to establish the spirit of "building the country through diligence and thrift," "running enterprises through diligence and thrift," and "running all undertakings through diligence and thrift," to greatly reduce administrative expenses, strictly limit the increase of personnel, and thoroughly eliminate all kinds of extravagance and waste. For the staff of state organs, enterprises, and public institutions, it is also clearly stipulated that, except for individual adjustments this year, wages will generally not be increased, nor will ranks be raised; and those with excessively high wages should be appropriately reduced. Since the pace of construction has slowed down, there is a surplus of existing employees. Therefore, this year, departments generally do not need to add new workers. Based on this situation, the State Council decided to stop recruiting apprentices and extend the study period of existing apprentices.
    It should be admitted that it is not good that the state had an excessively large plan in its construction plan last year. The reason for this situation is mainly because we have little experience in carrying out large-scale construction in a large country with a population of 600 million, and we do not know how strong the country's capabilities are. In particular, we have not found the law of how to carry out construction in a backward agricultural country to truly achieve the fastest speed. A large part of the state's construction funds must be accumulated through agriculture, and China is still a country where agricultural production occupies a major position; and the agricultural population is large, the arable land is small, and the part that can provide accumulation in agricultural production is not large. Therefore, practicing strict economy and implementing the policy of "building the country through diligence and thrift" is a fundamental policy for economically backward countries to strive for the fastest speed of construction. Since we want to "build the country through diligence and thrift," then the number of personnel in management departments and production departments should not be too large, and the living standards of employees should not be raised too quickly, especially considering that it should not differ too much from the lives of farmers. This is the fundamental reason why the state has proposed an appropriate contraction policy for wage increases and rank promotions for employees this year. The excessively large plan last year was a shortcoming; however, if measures are not taken this year to reverse the various deviations caused by the excessively large plan last year, a bigger mistake will be made. Therefore, it should be said that the various measures taken by the state at present, including the extension of the study period for apprentices, are completely necessary and are in line with the long-term interests of national construction and the people.
    Of course, for a group of apprentices who cannot be transferred to formal worker status according to the original plan, their hopes cannot be realized, some of their original plans will be affected, and their income may be less than after the transfer to formal worker status, which can be said to be a loss. However, this loss has little impact on the lives of apprentices. If we look at the living conditions of the people across the country, we cannot fail to see that the current living conditions of apprentices are better than those of some farmers; they are much better than those in cities who have not yet had the opportunity to find employment. Apprentices are all young people, with no family burden or very little family burden. If compared with workers with heavy burdens, the lives of apprentices are also much better. Therefore, extending the study period of apprentices has little impact on the lives of the vast majority of apprentices. As for the few apprentices whose original treatment was too low compared with other units and who have heavy family burdens and therefore have real difficulties, after the extension of the study period, the administration and trade union should provide appropriate solutions from the relief projects based on specific circumstances.
    It is beneficial for apprentices who cannot be transferred to formal worker status according to the original plan to study for some more time and learn some more things. In the past few years, due to the rapid development of national construction and the very weak original technical force, various departments generally adopted rapid methods to train apprentices, often transferring apprentices to formal worker status in just one year, or even half a year or three months. Under the circumstances at the time, this played a certain positive role in national economic construction. However, this method of seeking rapid results by narrowing the scope of study and shortening the study time is not a normal method after all, and it can only be regarded as an emergency measure. Facts have proved that the new workers trained by this method, due to the short time and the few things learned, have a relatively poor degree of technical proficiency, often only knowing this operation but not that operation, and having difficulties in changing products or replacing equipment. At the same time, due to the short time of practical training in production for apprentices, they cannot use the equipment freely, and their technology is not skilled enough, so there are more accidents. From the accident statistics of factories, there are relatively few old skilled workers, and the most are second- and third-level workers, the reason for which lies here.
    With the gradual normal development of national construction, the current apprentice system must be fundamentally reformed. In the future, the recruitment of apprentices must stipulate a longer training period and appropriate treatment, so that they can learn more technology, not only understanding and knowing, but also having a certain degree of proficiency; not only learning the technology of one type of work and one process, but also learning multiple technologies, in order to adapt to the country's requirements for enterprises to produce multiple varieties, which is of particular importance to mechanical and electrical enterprises. Therefore, the extension of the study period for apprentices this year is in line with the country's requirements for considering the fundamental reform of the apprentice system. Apprentices who cannot be transferred to formal worker status temporarily, after understanding the specific situation and difficulties of national construction and development, should, on the one hand, understand the country's difficulties, and on the other hand, seize the opportunity to extend their studies, better train themselves, and learn more skills, preparing to be able to take on their jobs pleasantly and competently soon.
    When apprentices do not understand the above situations, once they hear that the study period is to be extended, it is inevitable that there will be emotional fluctuations. Some people may say strange things, and some people may even cause trouble. Therefore, the leaders of enterprises and public institutions should explain the above principles to the apprentices and discuss with the apprentices how to deal with the country's difficulties. It should be affirmed that the vast majority of apprentices, after more than a year of training by the state and receiving education from the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union in many aspects, generally have patriotism and enthusiasm for building socialism, and are able to accept this decision. The experience of many places in implementing this decision has also proved that as long as the leaders earnestly reveal the situation of the country and explain the principles clearly, the young apprentices are generally able to treat this issue with a correct attitude. The Beijing People's Machine Factory originally planned to conduct a skills test and transfer a group of apprentices to formal worker status in March this year. At that time, upon receiving the notice from the higher authorities to suspend the transfer to formal worker status, it revealed the difficulties to the apprentices and explained the principles clearly, which eliminated the apprentices' dissatisfaction and various doubts. The apprentices said: "The country has great difficulties, and individuals have small difficulties. Small difficulties should be subordinate to great difficulties." The Party and government organs in Shanghai conducted explanations to apprentices throughout the city, which was also supported by the apprentices. These all show that by explaining the situation and explaining the principles, the vast number of apprentices who are looking forward to being transferred to formal worker status can obey the long-term interests and support the state's measures. However, it must be noted that extending the study period is, after all, related to the apprentices' vital interests, and it must not be simply suppressed with grand principles. Therefore, in addition to conducting meticulous political education, the leaders of various departments, enterprises, and public institutions should also make proper arrangements for the learning issues during the extended period, such as what new types of work to learn, how to formulate new apprenticeship contracts, etc., and pay attention to the individual special difficulties among them, and actively solve their reasonable and feasible requirements in life and study, creating favorable conditions for them to study with peace of mind.
    We also hope that the parents of apprentices can treat this issue with a correct attitude and encourage their children to obey the country's decision and continue to study hard.
    The issue of apprentices' delayed graduation is one of the contradictions among the people that currently exists. Whether this contradiction can be handled well depends on the leadership. Therefore, we hope that the Party committees and People's Committees in areas with more apprentices can directly intervene in this work, so that the State Council's notice can be smoothly implemented.

### 正确处理今年学徒的转正问题

    正确处理今年学徒的转正问题
    去年各部门、各地区都招收了大量的学徒（练习生）。其中一部分人在企业和事业单位中学习，一部分人在技工学校或技工训练班学习。按照原来的计划，大部分要在今年内转为正式工人。但是，由于今年国家建设速度放慢，各部门需要补充的新工人比原计划大大减少，而且现行的学徒制度也不尽合理，因此，最近国务院发出通知，要求各部门、各省市根据生产需要、整个部门和地区人员平衡的情况，考虑学徒的转正问题。如果不需要补充新的工人，现有学徒就延长学习期限。因此，除个别产业部门以外，大部分学徒今年都将延长学习期限，但延长期满，经过考工合格以后，就一律转正，不再延长。
    1956年是我国经济建设空前巨大发展的一年。但是，在胜利发展的形势下，也产生了计划过大的偏差，建设的规模和速度实际上超过了国家的实力。人员培训计划是整个建设计划的一个组成部分，整个建设计划过大了，人员培训的计划自然也就过大了。去年大量招收徒工，就是在这样的计划指导下进行的。以第一机械工业部为例，这个部所属企业1954年和1955年全部徒工都只有八千名，而去年一年就增加到四万名，比前两年多了四倍，显然是过多了。
    国家经过去年一年生产和建设的实践，更加去年自然灾害严重，农业生产计划没有完成，影响了国家财政收入和物资的收购，因而今年国家不能不及时调整计划，放慢建设速度；同时采取一系列措施，来扭转去年造成的计划过大的偏向，不少计划兴建的企业停建了；一些原定今年投入生产的新建企业，也因为投资削减而不能不缓建或推迟建成期限；现有企业的生产也因为原材料供应的限制，而不得不压缩生产计划。我们的党中央提出了开展增产节约运动的号召，要求各部门树立“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办企业”、“勤俭办一切事业”的精神，大量节减行政费用，严格限制人员的增加，并且彻底消灭各种铺张浪费现象。对于国家机关工作人员、企业单位和事业单位的职工，也明确地规定，在今年除个别调整以外，一般地不增加工资，也不提高级别；部分工资过高的人应适当予以降低。建设速度既然放缓，现有职工就有了多余，因此，今年各部门一般都不需要增加新的工人。根据这个情况，国务院决定停止招收学徒，并延长已有学徒的学习期限。
    应该承认，国家在建设计划上出现去年计划过大的情况，是不好的。产生这种情况的原因，主要是由于我们在一个六亿人口的大国进行大规模建设，经验还很少，对国家的实力究竟有多大还不摸底，特别是对于一个落后的农业国如何进行建设，才能真正达到最快的速度，还没有找到规律。国家建设资金的很大部分要靠农业来积累，我国目前还是一个农业生产占主要地位的国家；而农业人口多，耕地少，农业生产中能够提供积累的部分是不大的。因此，厉行节约，执行“勤俭建国”的方针，是经济落后的国家争取以最快速度来建设的一个根本方针。既然要“勤俭建国”，那末，在管理部门、生产部门的人员就不能过多，职工的生活水平也不能提高过快，特别是要考虑到和农民生活不能相差过大。这就是为什么国家在今年对职工的增资、晋级要提出适当收缩方针的根本原因。去年计划过大了，是一个缺点；但是，如果今年不采取措施，扭转因为去年计划过大而产生的各种偏差，就要犯更大的错误。因此，应当说，国家现时采取的各项措施，包括延长学徒学习期限在内，是完全必要的，是符合国家建设和人民长远利益的。
    当然，对于一批不能按照原计划转为正式工人的学徒来说，他们的希望不能实现，他们原来的一些打算会受到影响，他们的收入比转正以后有的可能要少些，这都可以说是一种损失。但是，这种损失对学徒的生活影响是不大的。如果从全国人民的生活情况来看，也不能不看到目前学徒的生活待遇要比一部分农民好；要比城市中还未得到就业机会的人民好得多。学徒全是青年，没有什么家庭负担或者家庭负担很少，如果同负担重的工人来比，学徒的生活也好得多。因此，延长学徒的学习期限，对绝大多数学徒的生活影响是不大的。至于学徒之中，少数原有待遇比其他单位过低，家庭负担又重，因而确有困难的，在延长学习期限之后，应当由行政和工会根据具体情况，从救济项目中予以适当解决。
    学徒不能按原计划转为正式工人，多学一些时间，多学一些东西，倒是有好处的。过去几年，由于国家建设发展的速度较快，而原有技术力量又非常薄弱，各部门一般都采取了速成的办法来培训徒工，往往只用一年，甚至半年或三个月的时间，就把学徒转为正式工人。这在当时情况下，对国家经济建设起了一定的积极作用。但是，这种用缩小学习范围、缩短学习时间，来求得速成的办法，毕竟不是一种正常的办法，它只能算是一种救急的措施。事实证明，用这种办法培训出来的新工人，由于时间短，学的东西少，技术的熟练程度是较差的，往往只会这种操作，不会那种操作，一旦变更产品或调换设备就有困难。同时，由于徒工生产实践的锻炼时间短，对于设备也就不能运用自如，技术也不够熟练，因而各种事故也比较多。从工厂的事故统计来看，老技工都比较少，最多的是二、三级工，其原因就在这里。
    随着国家建设逐步正常的发展，目前的学徒制度是必须从根本上加以改革的。今后招收学徒，必须规定较长的培养期限和适当的待遇，要使他们多学一点技术，不仅要懂、要会，还要有一定的熟练程度；不仅要学会一个工种、一个工序的技术，还要学会多种技术，以适应国家对企业多品种生产的要求，这一点对于机电企业来说，有着特别重要的意义。因此，今年学徒延长学习期限，和国家考虑根本改革学徒制度的要求是一致的。暂时不能转正的学徒，在认识了国家建设发展的具体情况和困难之后，一方面应当体谅国家的困难，一方面还应当抓住延长学习的时机，更好地锻炼自己，多学一些本领，准备不久之后能够胜任愉快地走上工作岗位。
    当学徒们还不了解以上这些情况的时候，一旦听到要延长学习期限，在情绪上是难免要发生波动的。有的人也许会说些怪话，有的人甚至还要闹事。因此，企业和事业单位的领导人员应当向学徒们讲清以上道理，同学徒们一起讨论应当如何对待国家的困难。应当肯定，绝大多数的学徒，经过国家一年多的培养，接受了党、团、工会多方面的教育，一般都是有爱国心，有建设社会主义热情的，是能够接受这一个决定的。很多地方执行这一个决定的经验也证明：只要领导人员认真地把国家的情况摊开来，把道理讲清楚，青年学徒们一般是能够做到以正确态度来对待这个问题的。北京人民机器厂原来计划在今年3月要进行一批学徒的考工转正，当时接到上级暂停转正的通知，就向学徒们揭开困难，说清道理，也就消除了学徒们的不满和各种疑虑。学徒们表示：“国家有大困难，个人有小困难，小困难应该服从大困难。”上海市由党、政机关向全市学徒进行了说明和解释，也得到了学徒们的拥护。这些都说明，通过讲明情况，讲通道理，广大期待转正的学徒们是能够服从长远利益，拥护国家措施的。然而，必须注意，延长学习期限，毕竟关系着学徒们的切身利益，绝不能简单地用大道理来压服。因此，除了进行细致的政治教育以外，各部门、各企业和事业单位的领导人员，还应该对于延长期间的学习问题，比如学习什么新的工种，怎样订立新的师徒合同等进行妥善安排，要注意他们之中个别特殊的困难，要积极解决他们在生活上、学习上合理而又可能办到的要求，为他们创造安心学习的有利条件。
    我们还希望学徒的家长们，也能够以正确的态度对待这个问题，鼓励自己的子弟服从国家的决定，继续努力学习。
    学徒延期出师问题，是当前存在的人民内部矛盾中的一个问题。这个矛盾能否处理得好，关键在于领导。因此，我们希望学徒较多的地区的党委和人民委员会，能够直接过问这项工作，使得国务院的通知能够顺利地贯彻执行。
