Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 17th.

    Zhang Yu, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Youth League, stated in his speech that the education of young people should be based on an attitude of care and enthusiastic assistance. The resolution of an ideological problem often goes through a continuous and repeated process. Patience and long-term efforts are required in the education of young people, and one should not demand too much too quickly.

    Ruan Ming, Secretary of the Tsinghua University Committee of the Youth League, said that in order to help students combine politics and professional work, the Youth League organization must strengthen ideological work. At the same time, it must help League cadres and activists closely connect with League members and students, be close friends with students, and use exemplary actions to motivate students to move forward.

    Tian Xin, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Youth League, pointed out in his speech that when educating middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to go to the countryside to engage in agricultural labor, it is not only necessary to educate them on the great principle of the glory of labor, but also to connect with their actual thinking.

    Lin Ping, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Youth League, pointed out in her speech that the example of advanced figures should be used to mobilize and organize young people. This is a mass line working method.

    Zha Bo Ping, a representative from the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, reported to the Congress on behalf of all League members and young people of the Chinese People's Volunteers about the mutual assistance and support between the Volunteer Army youth and the Korean people and Korean youth.

    Representatives who spoke at the meeting today also included Zhang Tingchao, Deputy Secretary of the Xifeng County Committee of the Youth League in Guizhou Province; Ding Shilian, Deputy Secretary of the Dingxi District Working Committee of the Youth League in Gansu Province; Wang Taigao, Secretary of the Jiangjin District Working Committee of the Youth League in Sichuan Province; Wang Buli, Secretary of the Sile Township General Branch of the Youth League in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province; Hong Shunli, Deputy Secretary of the Xiaodeng Township General Branch of the Youth League in Fujian Province; and Chi Minghai, Secretary of the Jining Railway Sub-bureau Committee of the Youth League.

    The representatives warmly welcomed the speeches of the youth representatives from Czechoslovakia, North Korea, East Germany, and Albania, as well as the representatives from the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Association of China. When they spoke at the meeting, enthusiastic applause repeatedly resounded throughout the venue.
