Saluting the Great Teachers of the Proletarian Revolution
Today marks the 139th anniversary of the birth of the great teacher of the proletarian revolution, Karl Marx. Every year on this day, many working people come to Marx's grave in London to offer flowers in tribute. The picture shows Nie Rongzhen, our special envoy to the Ghana Independence Day celebrations, paying his respects at the tomb during his stopover in London.
