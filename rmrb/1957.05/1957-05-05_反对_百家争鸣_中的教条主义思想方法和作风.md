    Opposing Doctrinaire Ideological Methods and Styles in the "Hundred Schools of Thought"
    Ding Hongfan
    Since the Party Central Committee put forward the academic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," some people have indeed been afraid of "letting go," while others have had concerns about not daring to "contend." In order to further implement this important policy of the Party, the People's Daily has not only devoted a lot of space to discussing this issue in recent weeks, but also invited ten professors in Tianjin to hold a forum. Although they represent a part of the opinion, they are welcomed and valued by Tianjin intellectuals. Among them, Professor Lei Haizong talked about Marxism "basically remaining at 1895. Doctrinaires are like this" (see the April 22nd report). The editor's note disagrees with this view and hopes to arouse everyone's discussion.
    First of all, at a time when some older intellectuals still have concerns about "luring the enemy in order to wipe them out" regarding the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, Professor Lei boldly expresses his own views, which we should welcome. As for his view of "remaining," if it is limited to the doctrinaires he mentioned, we should also agree. However, he also said that "in reality, it has stopped developing and is still stuck at 1895, when Engels died. After 1895, Lenin and Stalin had new ideas on individual issues, but they mainly talked about current revolutionary issues." The meaning of the context here is somewhat unclear. Judging from the literal meaning, we greatly disagree. The problem is: in fact, Marxism is constantly developing, but doctrinaires subjectively regard it as a dead dogma that cannot be developed (although they also say it is developing verbally).
    Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao and other Marxists have developed Marxism in many aspects of basic theory, which is a well-known fact. I don't intend to elaborate on it here. Because Marxism has suffered too much from the disguised Marxism of doctrinairism, I would like to talk about the ideological methods and styles of doctrinaires and their harm to scientific development.
    Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao and other Marxists never said "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words (or God's words) will by no means pass away" (Jesus and other religious leaders said something similar), but only doctrinaires make the "words of God" they have compiled into eternal dogmas to force others to obey. The old doctrinaires of the Middle Ages killed many scientists and ruled the entire dark age. At that time, the doctrinairism of various countries in the East and the West was indeed the most vicious enemy of science. The current new doctrinairism appears in another posture, but its harm to science and the revolutionary cause is no less than that of the old doctrinairism in the Middle Ages.
    The difference between doctrinaires and scientists or Marxists does not lie in their verbal expressions, but in their ideological methods and styles. The reason why a scientist becomes a scientist is because he has a correct materialistic viewpoint and dialectical logical method, that is, he has the attitude of "seeking truth from facts" as Chairman Mao said, which is the Marxist world view. In this way, when a scientist studies things, he never presupposes that a certain statement is correct and must be supported, and another is wrong and must be suppressed, but starts from objective and specific facts, conducts careful analysis, and then puts forward sufficient reasons to make a judgment. Such a scientific attitude and method are persuasive. Doctrinaires do not understand how to do this. They first look for a "subtle word" (the word of God or Confucius's "The Master said") in the classics, and then subjectively extend its "great meaning" to distort the facts, claiming to be the protector (orthodox Marxist) who "speaks for God" or "speaks for the sage." If they cannot find a subtle word like "The Master said" for a specific fact, they will be at a loss and complain, "If the Master does not speak, then what can the younger generation say!" Stalin vividly satirized the ugly state and harm of doctrinaires. He told the story of the Crimean naval mutiny, when revolutionary soldiers asked the Social Democrats for instructions. The latter searched all the classics of Marx and Engels but could not find anything about the Crimean mutiny, so they could not give any instructions. As a result, the mutiny failed. In their work style, doctrinaires hold a dogma in one hand and a sword in the other. Whoever does not accept their dogma will be given a sword. The most common thing is to use the simplest and crudest means to put a big hat on comrades who disagree with them, causing them all kinds of spiritual and material blows.
    Marxism is scientific truth. Once scientific workers who seek truth understand Marxism, they will sincerely support it. Because of this, Marxism is not afraid of "contention." However, when planning the "Hundred Schools of Thought" and scientific research methods, it is impossible to predetermine Marxism as the guiding ideology or standard. If we affirm one family's words first and then conduct research or discussion, this is precisely the anti-Marxist doctrinaire ideological method, which will inevitably lead to a doctrinaire arbitrary style. Chairman Mao and other Marxist classic authors told us that the only criterion for truth is practice, not the words of one family. Doctrinaires say that they take Marxism-Leninism as their guiding ideology, but in fact they secretly take the dogmas they have concocted as their guiding ideology. This has always been the behavior of doctrinaires. The reason why doctrinaires are so fierce is because they use this method to impersonate orthodoxy and can rely on their official position to act conveniently. If this is not exposed, a back door will be left for doctrinaires, which is very dangerous for the development of science. All true Marxists who are convinced that Marxism is the truth will inevitably support the展开研究和争论用正规的scientific methods to conduct research and debates, because only in this way can truth be obtained and people convinced. After all, there is only one truth, and after arguing, it will naturally come down to Marxism. Only those doctrinaires who have no confidence in Marxism are afraid of "letting go" and insist on affirming it in advance. Therefore, in order to better carry out the "contention" and scientific research work, those kind-hearted leading comrades who repeatedly insist that the "Hundred Schools of Thought" should be guided by Marxism-Leninism (for example, a leading comrade repeatedly made such remarks during the forum) can still carefully consider this issue.
    As far as the current situation is concerned, there is still the phenomenon of "turning pale at the mention of the tiger" regarding doctrinairism. In order to welcome the high tide of cultural construction and catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in eleven years, there is a trend of "if you don't block it, it won't flow; if you don't stop it, it won't work" for this monster that hinders "contention" and opposes science.

    反对“百家争鸣”中的教条主义思想方法和作风
    丁洪范
    从党中央提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的学术方针以来，确有一部分人害怕“放”，而另有一部分人却有不敢“鸣”的顾虑。人民日报为了进一步贯彻党的这个重要方针，近旬以来除划出很多篇幅讨论这个问题外，并在天津邀请了十位教授座谈。虽然他们代表一部分意见，但却为天津知识分子所欢迎并重视的。其中雷海宗教授谈出了马克思主义“基本上停留在1895年。教条主义者就是这样”（见4月22日报）。编者按、注对这样看法不能同意，希望引起大家的讨论。
    首先，在一部分年长知识分子中间对“百家争鸣”方针还存在着“诱敌聚歼”的顾虑的时候，雷教授大胆地谈出自己的看法，这是我们所应该欢迎的。至于他所谈的“停留”看法如果只限于他所提到的教条主义者，我们也应同意。可是他也谈到“实际上是停止了发展，还停留在恩格斯死时1895年的地方。1895年以后，列宁，斯大林在个别问题上有新的提法，但他们主要谈当前革命问题”。这里上下文义有些不明，就字面看来，我们是大大不能同意的。问题是：事实上马克思主义是在不断发展着，而教条主义者却主观地把它看成死的教条不能发展的了（虽然口头上也说是发展的）。
    列宁，斯大林，毛主席及其他马克思主义者在基本理论的许多方面发展了马克思主义，这是人所共知的事实，我这里不拟缕述。因为马克思主义吃了伪装马克思主义的教条主义的亏太大了，我这里倒想谈一谈教条主义者的思想方法和作风及其对科学发展的危害性。
    马克思，恩格斯，列宁，斯大林，毛主席及其他马克思主义者从未说过“天地都要废去，我的话（或神的话）一点一划也不能废去”（耶稣及其他教主类似地说了），而只是教条主义者把自己所编出来的“神的话”作成千古不移的教条来强制别人遵守。中世纪的旧教条主义者杀害了多少科学家，统治着整个黑暗时代。当时东西各国的教条主义确是科学的最凶恶的敌人。目前的新教条主义则以另一种姿态出现，但其对科学和革命事业的危害性实不下于中世纪的旧教条主义。
    教条主义者与科学家或马克思主义者的区别不在他们的口头表白，而在他们的思想方法和作风。科学家之所以成为科学家是因为他有正确的唯物观点和辩证的逻辑方法，也就是有毛主席所说的“实事求是”的态度，这也就是马克思主义的世界观。就这样，科学家研究事物决不预先肯定某一种言论是对的必须拥护，另一种是错的必须压制，而是从客观的具体事实出发加以缜密的分析，然后提出充足的理由作成判断。这样的科学态度和方法才有说服力。教条主义者不会懂得这样做，他先从经典中去找一句“微言”（神的话或儒教的“子曰”），然后主观地引伸其“大义”去曲解事实，自命是“代神立言”或“代圣立言”的护道者（正统马克思主义者）。万一对于某一具体事实找不到“子曰”一类的微言，则皇皇然无所措手足而埋怨说，“子如不言，则小子何述焉！”斯大林生动地讽刺了教条主义者的丑态和危害。他讲述了克里米海军暴动时，革命士兵向社会民主党人请示的故事，后者找遍了马—恩经典而没能找到涉及克里米暴动的话，因此不能作出任何指示。结果这次暴动失败了。在工作作风上教条主义者一只手拿教条，一只手拿宝剑，谁不接受他的教条，就给谁一剑。其最常见的是用最简单粗暴的手段扣上一个大帽子压制意见异己的同志，使受精神上和物质上的种种打击。
    马克思主义是科学的真理，凡求真理的科学工作者一旦了解了马克思主义，无不诚心拥护的。正因为如此，马克思主义才不畏惧“争鸣”。可是在规划“百家争鸣”和科学研究的方法时却不能预先规定以马克思主义作为指导思想或标准。如果这样先肯定一家之言然后进行研究或讨论，这正是反马克思主义的教条主义思想方法，由此也必然会产生教条主义的武断作风。毛主席及其他马克思主义经典作者告诉我们真理的唯一标准是实践，不是某家之言。教条主义者口里说以马克思列宁主义为指导思想，其实偷偷地是以他自己所杜撰的教条为指导思想，自古教条主义者的行径都是如此。教条主义者之所以凶狠，就是因为他以这种手法来冒名正统，可以倚官托势，便宜行事。这一点若不揭穿，就会给教条主义者留个后门，那对科学的发展是很危险的。凡确信马克思主义是真理的真正马克思主义者必然会拥护用正规的科学方法展开研究和争论，因为只有这样才能得出真理，使人信服。毕竟真理只有一个，争来争去自然而然会归结到马克思主义的。只有那些对马克思主义无信心的教条主义者才害怕“放”而坚持预先加以肯定。因此为了更好地展开“争鸣”和科学研究工作，那些善良的领导同志中再三坚持“百家争鸣”应以马克思列宁主义为指导思想者（例如座谈中一位领导同志曾屡次发表这样的谈话）对于这个问题还可加以慎重的考虑。
    就目前的情况而论，对于教条主义还有“谈虎色变”的景象。为迎接文化建设的高潮，要在十一年内赶上世界先进科学的水平，对于这个阻碍“争鸣”反科学的怪物实有“不塞不流，不止不行”之势。
