    The Voice of a British Mother
    Urges Macmillan to Visit the Soviet Union for Peace
    (Reported by this newspaper) Serious consultations with the Soviet Union and a swift agreement to ban nuclear weapons have become the urgent demands of the broad masses of the British people. Reprinted here is a letter from an ordinary British woman published in the British "Daily Worker" on May 4th. It expresses the common feelings of mothers. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Mr. Macmillan:
    Please allow me, as a mother of three children, to implore you to negotiate with the Soviet Union immediately to reach an agreement to stop hydrogen bomb testing and eliminate the threat of war.
    I am no longer prepared to remain silent if the actions of politicians mean that our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren will be crippled and suffer from painful diseases.
    We are not reassured by having these weapons. Hydrogen bomb testing will bring untold suffering to mothers and unborn babies.
    I was born in the First World War; my daughter was born in the Second World War; we must take action to stop war, otherwise humanity will be hopeless.
    Mr. Macmillan, please go to the Soviet Union, visit the Soviet people, and return with an agreement that truly signifies "peace in our time." Mrs. May Hill

    英国母亲的声音
    敦促麦克米伦访苏求和平
    本报讯　同苏联进行认真的协商、迅速达成禁止核武器的协议，已成为英国广大群众的迫切要求。这里转载的是一封发表在5月4日的英国“工人日报”上的一位普通英国妇女的信。它表达了母亲们的共同的感情。信的全文如下：亲爱的麦克米伦先生：
    请允许我以三个孩子的母亲的身份请求你立即与苏联谈判，达成停止氢弹试验的协议，免除战争威胁。
    如果政治家们的行动意味着我们的孩子、孙子、曾孙将成为残废和遭受痛苦的疾病的话，我就不准备再沉默了。
    我们有了这些武器并不能使我感到放心些。氢弹的试验会给母亲们和将诞生的婴孩招致说不尽的痛苦的遭遇。
    我生于第一次世界大战；我的女儿生在第二次世界大战；我们必须采取行动制止战争，否则人类似将无希望。
    麦克米伦先生，请到苏联去，访问苏联人民，并且带着一项真正意味着“我们时代和平”的协议回来。　梅·希尔夫人
