    The situation reflected at the symposium of senior engineering and technical personnel of the Ministry of Geology indicates that insufficient trust, improper use, insufficient care, and inadequate support are the unanimous calls of the majority of engineering and technical personnel, and also the main reasons for the lack of coordination between the current Party and government leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel in enterprises.

    Some people pointed out in the symposium that in the past few years, the relationship between Party and government leading cadres at all levels of the Ministry of Geology and engineering and technical personnel has improved. Many engineering and technical personnel have made great progress and achieved remarkable results in their work. However, the relationship between Party and government leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel is still not coordinated enough.

    Having Title Without Power Leads to Hesitation

    Many people said in the symposium that some units do not have enough trust in engineering and technical personnel. Some engineering and technical personnel in field prospecting and exploration teams have a title without real power. When the team leader in charge of administrative work makes decisions, they often do not solicit the opinions of the technical负责人 (technical lead). Assigning students to study abroad places too much emphasis on politics and ignores technology. One unit wanted to send four technical personnel to study abroad, but the Ministry of Geology's Cadre Department designated the candidates, resulting in low-quality personnel being sent, while those with considerable skill and practical work experience were not sent. An engineer who used to work in the Northeast Geological Bureau said with emotion: Although some of us cannot yet be called "red experts," after several years of cultivation and education by the Party, we are at least worthy of being called "pink experts"; however, some leading cadres there do not see it that way. Some people mentioned: Due to insufficient trust and not being allowed to use their abilities freely, many technical personnel hesitate in their work, and their enthusiasm has not been well utilized.

    Studying One Thing, Using Another, Frequent Transfers

    Some people believe that the improper use of engineering and technical personnel is still quite serious. Some graduates from universities and specialized schools are often assigned to do office work instead of being allowed to come into contact with practical work first, preventing them from improving quickly. The current organizational structure in some cases is inappropriate, and technical personnel have nothing to do, which is very depressing. Some cadres have them looking for coal this year, manganese next year, and petroleum the year after, resulting in them becoming "jacks-of-all-trades" who are not specialized in anything. At present, geological exploration work has entered a stage of planned development, and technical cadres should be fixed in certain mineral types and regions to facilitate their improvement.

    Scientific Research Encounters Many Difficulties

    Some people say that the slogan of marching towards science was very loud last year, but now it is somewhat diminished. Some young technical personnel feel that their theoretical level is low and urgently need to study, but so far the leadership has not helped to solve this problem. Some older engineering and technical personnel feel that there is a lack of data, insufficient books, and poor research conditions, and the leadership has not helped to solve these problems in a timely manner. Some people believe that the Ministry of Geology's training of middle-level technical cadres is particularly inadequate. An engineer said: We have old predecessors (old technical personnel) above us and Party members and Youth League members (referring to young technical personnel who have joined the Party and the League) below us. The young get to go abroad for visits, and the old get to study abroad, but we get stuck in the middle, becoming "card-level cadres" who cannot improve. Some people feel that their old knowledge is increasingly insufficient, and they are very depressed.

    Some people pointed out that geological work is a scientific and technological endeavor, and there are many things to "contend" about, such as there are many schools of thought in tectonic geology, leaving young people at a loss. However, due to a lack of support, promotion, and organization, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" has not been well implemented in the Ministry of Geology. Some older technical personnel take on too much administrative work or spend too much time in meetings, becoming "unoccupied with their proper duties." The confidentiality system is too strict, and some data cannot be accessed. This also greatly affects scientific research work. Some units are also doing a poor job in caring for engineering and technical personnel politically and in their studies.

    Some Cadres Have Crude Work Styles

    Some people have raised that some Party and administrative cadres have crude work styles and simplistic working methods, are unable to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and even engage in suppression and retaliation. In one unit, a Party member technician put forward his views on a certain job, and as a result, he was criticized for having "anti-Party thoughts." Some cadres, upon seeing shortcomings in technical personnel, do not adopt a critical and uniting attitude but instead adopt tough methods of struggle, making those who have made mistakes unable to hold their heads up. Furthermore, some Party and administrative leading cadres do not provide timely assistance to engineering and technical personnel with shortcomings but only nitpick about their backwardness in this and that, thereby deepening the gap between technical personnel and Party and government cadres.

    Technical Personnel Also Have Shortcomings

    Some people mentioned that some engineering and technical personnel are not humble enough and have complacent emotions. Some young technical personnel are unwilling to humbly learn from old technical personnel. Some engineering and technical personnel overemphasize personal interests in scientific research work, and their research topics deviate from practical needs. There are also some people who are unwilling to start with small-scale, step-by-step research but instead always want to pursue big projects, resulting in poor results. There are also those who are afraid of taking responsibility and are not bold in their work.

    Meeting of Minds Eliminates Barriers

    Everyone believes that the existence of these problems has caused bad consequences for production work and scientific research and should be addressed with measures. Many people propose that criticism and self-criticism should be carried out between Party and government cadres and engineering and technical personnel. As long as they can meet minds with each other, many barriers can be eliminated.

    The symposium of senior engineering and technical personnel of the Ministry of Geology was convened by the Party Group of the Ministry of Geology of the CPC. It was held four times from April 30 to May 6. During the symposium, more than 30 senior engineering and technical personnel in Beijing participated. At the end of the symposium, He Changgong, Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Geology of the CPC, on behalf of the Party Group of the Ministry of Geology, expressed his gratitude for the many criticisms and suggestions put forward by everyone and stated that he would carefully study these criticisms and suggestions and improve them in future work. He also hoped that engineering and technical personnel would put forward more criticisms and suggestions on leadership work in the future.

### 信任不足　使用不当　关心不够　支持不力  地质部高级技术人员坦率批评领导缺点

    信任不足　使用不当　关心不够　支持不力
    地质部高级技术人员坦率批评领导缺点
    本报特约新华社专稿　地质部高级工程技术人员座谈会反映的情况表明，信任不足、使用不当、关心不够、支持不力，是大多数工程技术人员的一致呼声，也是目前企业党、政领导干部跟工程技术人员之间关系不够协调的主要原因。
    在座谈中有些人指出，过去几年来，地质部各级党、政领导干部同工程技术人员的关系是有改进的。许多工程技术人员有了很大进步，并且在工作中做出了显著成绩。但是，党、政领导干部同工程技术人员之间关系还不够协调。
    有职无权缩手缩脚
    不少人在座谈当中，说有些单位对工程技术人员不够信任。有些野外普查勘探队的工程技术人员有职无权，担任行政工作的队长做决定时，往往不征求技术负责人的意见。派留学生偏重政治，忽视技术。有一个单位要派四名技术人员到国外学习，可是由地质部干部司指名，结果派出的人质量很低，而有相当水平和实际工作经验的人却没有派去。一位原来在东北地质局工作的工程师感慨地说：我们有些人虽然还不能称为“红色专家”，但是经过党几年来的培养教育，至少也够得上“水红色的专家”了；可是那里的一些领导干部却不这样看。有些人谈到：由于信任不够、使用不放手，不少技术人员工作中缩手缩脚，积极性没有很好发挥。
    学非所用调动频繁
    有些人认为，对工程技术人员使用不当的情况，还相当严重。有些大学和专科学校的毕业生，往往被分配做机关工作，而不让他们先去接触实际，使他们不能很快提高。目前有的机构设置不当，技术人员没有事可做，很苦闷。有些干部今年让他们找煤，明年又让他们找锰，后年又让他们找石油，结果成了“万金油”，哪样也不专。目前地质勘探工作已经进入有计划发展阶段，应该让技术干部固定在一定的矿种、地区，以便于他们的提高。
    科学研究困难重重
    有人说，向科学进军的口号，去年喊得很响，现在却有些消沉。有些年轻的技术人员感到理论水平低，迫切要求学习，可是至今领导上还没有帮助解决这个问题。有些老的工程技术人员感到资料少、图书不足、研究条件差，领导上也没有及时帮助解决。有些人认为地质部对中等技术干部的培养尤其不够。一位工程师说：我们上有老前辈（老的技术人员）、下有党团员（指入党入团的青年技术人员），出国参观年纪轻、留学年纪大，都轮不到，被卡在中间，成了“卡级干部”，老不能提高。有些人感到老本越来越不够用，心里很苦闷。
    有的人指出：地质工作是一项科学技术工作，要“鸣”的东西很多，如大地构造学说就有许多学派，青年人无所适从，但是由于没有人支持、推动和组织，“百家争鸣”的方针在地质部还没有很好贯彻。有些老的技术人员担任行政工作过多，或者开会时间过多，“不务正业”；保密制度过严，有些资料看不到。这也大大影响了科学研究工作，有些单位在政治上、学习上关心工程技术人员也做得很差。
    有些干部作风粗暴
    有些人提出有些党和行政干部作风粗暴、工作方法简单化，不能虚心听取群众意见，甚至打击报复。有一个单位一位党员技术人员对某项工作提出了自己的看法，结果被批评为“反党思想”。有的干部看到技术人员有缺点，不是采取批评团结的态度，而是采取强硬的斗争办法，使有错误的人抬不起头来。还有的党和行政领导干部对有缺点的工程技术人员，不及时帮助，而只是挑剔这也落后那也落后，从而加深了技术人员跟党、政干部之间的隔阂。
    技术人员也有缺点
    有些人谈到有些工程技术人员不够虚心，有骄傲自满情绪；有些年轻的技术人员不愿向老技术人员虚心学习。有些工程技术人员在科学研究工作中过分强调个人兴趣，研究题目脱离实际需要。还有些技术人员不愿从小处着手一点一滴地研究起，而是处处想抓大的，效果不好。还有的人怕负责任，工作不大胆。
    思想见面消除隔膜
    大家认为这些问题的存在，对生产工作和科学研究都造成了不好的后果，应该采取措施加以解决。很多人提出在党、政干部同工程技术人员之间要开展批评和自我批评，只要相互间能思想见面，许多隔膜是可以消除的。
    地质部高级工程技术人员座谈会是由中共地质部党组召开的，从4月30日到5月6日，先后开了四次。座谈期间，参加座谈的有三十多位在京的高级工程技术人员。在座谈会结束时，中共地质部党组书记何长工代表地质部党组，对大家提出的许多批评建议表示感谢，并且表示将很好地研究这些批评和建议，在今后工作中加以改进。他还希望工程技术人员今后对领导工作提出更多的批评和建议。
