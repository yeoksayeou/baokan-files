Professors Running Schools Good, or Party Committee System Good?
    The Jiusan Society Holds a Symposium to Initially Discuss Issues of Improving the Higher Education System

    (Our Newspaper News) The Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society convened a symposium on the evening of the 10th with some of its members working in higher education institutions and other units to discuss issues related to improving the higher education system and further promoting democracy in higher education institutions. Huang Ziqing, professor of the Department of Chemistry at Peking University, Pan Shu, director of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lou Bangyan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, and Qi Kaizhi, deputy director of academic affairs at Beijing Normal University, among others, expressed their opinions on the two issues of professors running schools and the party committee system in higher education institutions.

    At the meeting, there were several views on professors running schools and the party committee system:

    One view was that implementing professors running schools in higher education institutions, with the faculty council and evaluation committee primarily leading teaching and other professional work, could prevent undesirable phenomena such as personnel infighting, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of professors, and be conducive to improving the school's teaching work. The party committee system could also exist simultaneously, participating in leading the school's work, but the focus should be on general administrative work and ideological education.

    Another view was that, because today's situation is very different from that before liberation, whether or not to implement the method of professors running schools is still worth considering. Those holding this view believe that the many shortcomings existing in today's higher education institutions are not due to the party committee system being bad, but rather due to ideological and working style problems of many party members, who have committed the errors of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Many communists working in higher education institutions have good motives and are wholeheartedly trying to run the schools well; however, because they are generally younger, have less experience, or are not sufficiently familiar with the work, they often interfere too much in teaching work, do not respect teachers' opinions enough, and have too little contact with non-party faculty and staff, resulting in insufficient understanding between them. Therefore, the main problem in higher education institutions today is not to restore the past method of professors running schools, but to further promote democracy and improve leadership style and methods. Before making major decisions or resolutions, the school's administrative leadership or party committee should widely solicit opinions from all sides; they should listen to the opinions of professors, as well as the opinions of general faculty and staff. After thorough discussion, decisions should be made so that the school's leadership truly becomes democratic and centralized leadership based on the mass line. To achieve this, the power of the school affairs committee can be appropriately expanded, and more professors and other representative figures can be absorbed to participate, so that it truly undertakes the task of leading school affairs work, rather than being a mere formality. At the same time, professor symposiums should be held frequently, where people can chat casually to enhance understanding between party members and non-party members and establish close, comradely relationships. Speakers referred to this approach as democratic school management.

    Another opinion was to advocate for emulating the methods of the Central People's Government by turning the school affairs committee into a power organ like the People's Congress, with the president of the university as the chairman of the school affairs committee. Major policy issues related to the school's work would be discussed and approved by it before implementation.

    The speaking professors and scholars unanimously agreed that the leadership methods and work style of higher education institutions need to be improved, which is certain; but which method is more suitable for the current situation of school work and can more fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of professors and other employees, thereby improving teaching work, needs further careful study. Xu Deheng, chairman of the Jiusan Society, hoped that the comrades present would solicit more opinions after returning to their original units so that further discussions could be held soon.

### 教授治校好，还是党委制好？  九三学社召开座谈会初步讨论改进高等学校制度问题

    教授治校好，还是党委制好？
    九三学社召开座谈会初步讨论改进高等学校制度问题
    本报讯　九三学社中央常务委员会，十日晚召集部分在高等院校等单位工作的社员举行座谈会，讨论有关改进高等学校的制度，在高等学校中进一步发扬民主等问题。北京大学化学系教授黄子卿、科学院心理研究所所长潘菽、北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦、北京师范大学副教务长祁开智等人，就高等学校中实行教授治校和党委制两个问题发表了意见。
    会上，对教授治校和党委制有这样几种看法：
    一种看法是认为在高等学校中实行教授治校，由教授会和评议会来主要领导教学等业务工作，可以防止人事倾轧等不良现象，充分发挥教授的积极性，有利于搞好学校的教学工作。党委制也可以同时存在，参与领导学校的工作，但重点应放在一般的行政工作和思想教育工作方面。
    另一种看法是，由于今天的情况同解放前有了很大的不同，是否要实行教授治校的办法，还值得考虑。持有这种看法的人认为，今天高等学校的工作中所以存在着许多缺点，并不是由于党委制不好，而是许多党员的思想作风上有毛病，犯了官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的错误。许多在高等院校工作的共产党员的动机是好的，一心一意想把学校办好；但是由于他们一般都比较年轻，经验不多，或者业务不够熟悉，因而往往对教学工作干涉过多，对老师的意见尊重不够，同非党的教职员工的接触也比较少，彼此间了解很不够。因此，今天高等学校中的主要问题，不是要恢复过去教授治校的办法，而是要进一步发扬民主，改进领导作风和领导方法。学校的行政领导或党委会，在作出重大的决定或决议以前，应当广泛地听取各方面的意见；要听教授们的意见，也要听一般教职员工的意见。在经过充分的讨论以后，才作出决定，使学校的领导真正成为民主集中的群众路线的领导。为了作到这一点，可以适当地扩大校务委员会的权力，吸收更多的教授和其他有代表性的人士参加，使它真正担负起领导校务工作的任务，而不是一种形式。同时还应该经常召开一些教授座谈会，彼此随便谈谈心，以增进党员与非党人士之间的了解，建立起亲密的同志式的关系。发言的人把这种做法称之为民主办校。
    再一种意见是主张仿照中央人民政府的办法，把校务委员会变成像人民代表大会一样的权力机关，校长就是校务委员会的主席，有关学校工作中的大政方针问题由它讨论通过后执行。
    发言的教授学者们一致认为，高等学校的领导方法和工作作风需要改进，这是肯定的；但是究竟采取那一种办法更适合当前学校工作的情况，能够更加充分地发挥教授和其他员工的积极性主动性，从而把教学工作作得更好，则需要进一步地仔细研究。九三学社主席许德珩希望到会的同志们，回到原单位后多征求意见，以便最近再作进一步的讨论。
