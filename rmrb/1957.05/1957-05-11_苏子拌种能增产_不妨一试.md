Using Perilla Seeds for Seed Coating Can Increase Production – Worth a Try
	Lin Xi

　　In early 1956, an old worker in Shenyang told me that more than twenty years ago, when he was farming in the countryside, an old man told him a way to increase grain production. This method involved mixing steamed perilla seeds (an oilseed, about the size of millet, black in color) with the seeds before planting. According to him, even without fertilizer, the crops would grow well (if it was millet, the ears would be a foot long, and the grains would be full); also, crops grown from seeds coated with perilla would be protected from pests.

　　The specific method is: steam the perilla seeds, dry them in the sun, and then mix them with the seeds before sowing, generally two liters of millet seeds mixed with one liter of perilla seeds; three liters of sorghum or bean seeds mixed with one liter of perilla seeds; other crops such as corn can also be mixed according to appropriate proportions. Seeds mixed with perilla should not be fertilized.

　　The worker also said that one year, the pest infestation was severe in their hometown area (Dongshe Village, Wulong District, Fushun, Liaoning), and the crops in the surrounding areas were eaten by insects, but his crops grown from seeds coated with perilla were not eaten by insects at all.

　　He said that he had tested this method for eight years, and the results were good every year. After the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization emerged nationwide, he told the Party branch about this method. This worker is Wang Guishan, the section chief of the second processing workshop of the air compressor factory, and he is a Communist Party member.

　　The scientific rationale behind this agricultural production increase method is not yet clear. I entrusted the Dongjiao District Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Beijing to conduct experiments during the spring plowing season last year. Not long ago, Comrade Xiao Chunjiu of this Agricultural Technology Extension Station wrote to us saying:

　　“Last year, we accepted your commission and tested the method of mixing cooked perilla seeds with corn seeds for sowing at the ‘Shiyi’ Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Dongjiao District of Beijing. The results showed that corn grown with cooked perilla seeds increased production by an average of 16.5% compared to the control plots without cooked perilla seeds. From the growth situation, the seedlings mixed with cooked perilla seeds were significantly stronger and had darker green leaves during the seedling stage. There was no significant difference in the later growth stages, and the pest infestation was almost the same. Local farmers were very interested in this experiment because they could get 47.8 jin of corn more for every mu of land by using only one and a half jin of perilla seeds. However, we have not yet been able to analyze why it can increase production. We plan to experiment again this year."

　　It should be noted here that the experiment conducted by the Agricultural Technology Extension Station was not carried out exactly as the worker described (for example, the perilla seeds used were not steamed, but stir-fried). The experimental results also did not show a pest prevention effect.

　　The contrast between using perilla seeds for seed coating and not using perilla seeds for seed coating, in fact, showed an increase in production. What is going on? We hope that agricultural science research institutions and agricultural workers can further experiment with this method. If this method truly has a production-increasing effect, then it will have a significant meaning for our country's agricultural production.

### 苏子拌种能增产  不妨一试

    苏子拌种能增产
    不妨一试	林晰
    1956年初，沈阳的一个老工人告诉我：他二十多年前在农村种地时，一位老头告诉他一个增产粮食的办法。就是把苏子（一种油料，如小米粒大，色黑）蒸熟以后拌在播种的种子里。据他说，不用上肥料，就可以长好庄稼（如果是谷子，穗长一尺，谷粒饱满）；同时，用苏子拌种长出的庄稼，可以防虫害。
    具体的作法是：把苏子蒸后晒干，然后拌在种子里播下去，一般是二升谷种拌一升苏子；三升高粱或豆子拌一升苏子，其他玉米等作物也可按适当比例拌种。拌苏子的种不要施肥。
    这位工人还说：有一年，他们家乡一带（辽宁抚顺五龙区东社村）虫害严重，附近的庄稼都被虫吃光了，但是他用苏子拌种的庄稼一点也没有被虫吃。
    这个办法，他说已试验了八年，每年的效果都很好。全国出现农业合作化高潮以后，他把这个办法告诉了党支部。这个工人是空气压缩机厂第二加工车间的工段长王贵山，是共产党员。
    这项农业增产方法一时还说不出科学道理来。我委托北京市东郊区农业技术推广站在去年春耕季节作了试验。不久以前，这个农业技术推广站的萧春久同志给我们来信说：
   “去年我们接受你们的委托，在北京市东郊区‘十一’农业生产合作社试行了用熟苏子和玉米种混合播种方法的结果是：用熟苏子的玉米比没使熟苏子的对照地平均增产16.5％。从生长情况看，在苗期混播熟苏子的幼苗显着茁壮一些，叶色较浓绿。后期生长无大差异，虫害也几乎一样。这一试验当地农民很感兴趣，因为每亩地多用一斤半苏子就换来四十七点八斤玉米。但是，到底为什么能够增产，我们还分析不出来。今年我们准备再试验一年。”
    这里应该说明，农业技术推广站的试验并未完全按照那位工人所说的进行（例如使用的苏子不是蒸熟的，而是炒熟的）。试验结果也没有防虫害的作用。
    利用苏子拌种和不用苏子拌种的对比，事实上是增产了。这是怎么一会事？希望农业科学研究机构和农业工作者能够再加以试验。如果这种办法真有增产效果，那么对我们国家的农业生产将有重大的意义。
