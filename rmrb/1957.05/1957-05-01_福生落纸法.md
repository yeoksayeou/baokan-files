    Fu Sheng's Paper-Dropping Method
    Huang Yan's right hand deftly sways to the left, his left hand nimbly lifts to the right; white paper flutters forward in the wind, the paper lip swallows the paper whole. People say paper-dropping is hard to master, but Fu Sheng rarely drops them crookedly; people say paper-dropping makes your arms ache and your back sore, but Fu Sheng drops paper freely and easily.
    Note: Chen Fu Sheng is a machine printing technician at the Guangzhou People's Printing Factory. His paper-dropping method is the best: light, nimble, and accurate. His advanced method is now being promoted.

    福生落纸法
    黄炎右手轻巧向左摇，左手利落朝右抬；白纸迎风往前飘，纸唇将纸吞没了。人说落纸难寻窍，福生落纸歪的少；人说落纸痛臂酸腰，福生落纸自在逍遥。
    注：陈福生是广州人民印刷厂机印技工，他的落纸法最好：轻巧、准确。现正推广他的先进方法。
