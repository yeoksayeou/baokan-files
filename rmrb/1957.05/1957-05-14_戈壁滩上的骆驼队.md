    Camel Team on the Gobi Desert

    In the late winter and early spring, the landscape of the Yanqi Reclamation Area in Xinjiang still presents a monotonous tone. Everywhere is withered grass, and the earth seems to be covered by a huge piece of coarse yellow canvas. The sky seems to be covered with a thin layer of tulle, appearing so dim that even birds rarely fly.

    I came to this desolate grassland to visit the camel team led by Zhu Genniu. I bent over, walking laboriously through the thick, taller-than-a-person cogon grass, vaguely seeing the wriggling camel humps, the long whiskers of camel hair on the humps swaying in the wind. I thought: Almost there. Sure enough, before long, the round top of the yurt appeared in front of me.

    Zhu Genniu is tall and broad, his skin turned a deep purplish-black from years of wind and sun, with light-colored ripples floating on his wide face. He had just returned to the yurt after completing a transportation task, and we sat on the rolled-up bedding and started talking.

    This camel team is the only transportation force of the old state-owned Yanqi Stud Farm. The busiest season for transportation tasks is every spring. At that time, they have to transport grain, oil, salt, and other daily necessities, as well as yurts and other supplies, to the mountains for about 150 people, and transport feed for the studs and breeding sheep. The spring weather on the Gobi Desert is unpredictable. When the branches of the trees in the Yanqi Basin have already sprouted light green buds, the snow layer on the Yuldus Grassland in the northern Tianshan Mountains has not completely melted. Once, when the camel team reached the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, the weather was gloomy, and the wind and snow blocked the road. The camels had to bypass the snowdrifts; if they were careless, the camels would sink into the snow and risk freezing to death. When the camels could not bypass the snowdrifts along the way, they had to dig them open with their hands and flatten them with their feet. They finally overcame the wind and snow and safely crossed the Tianshan Mountains into the grassland.

    After entering the grassland, there were still more than seventy *li* to the destination, and they needed to spend the night on the way. How could they sleep with a foot-thick layer of snow everywhere? They unloaded the pack saddles, placed the camels in a ditch to shelter from the wind, ate some dry food themselves, opened the bedding, crawled into the quilt, and slept with their heads covered. When it dawned, the snow had buried everyone. Zhu Genniu crawled out of the snowdrift, feeling a little dizzy and his limbs feeling very tired, but he still persevered and followed the camel team straight to the destination to unload the goods.

    All year round, they are constantly transporting like this. Last year, they walked more than 20,000 *li*, transported 200,000 kilograms of materials, and turned over a net profit of more than 13,000 yuan to the state.

    I looked at the simple bedding rolls in the yurt, the thin felt spread on the grass, and the pot supported by an iron frame, and asked them, "Are you married?" They replied, "Not yet, the stud farm has just been established and we are busy! In a few years, when the work is more relaxed, we'll talk about it!" (Xu Tan) (Attached picture)

    戈壁滩上的骆驼队
    冬末春初，新疆焉耆垦区草原上，景物仍然呈现着单一的色调，到处是枯草，大地好像被一块粗黄的巨大的帆布复盖着似的。天空上好像被遮盖着一层薄薄的乌纱，显得那样昏暗，连鸟雀也很少飞翔。
    我来到这荒漠了的草原上，是为了访问朱根牛领导的骆驼队。我弯着腰，在一人多深的芨芨草丛中艰难地朝前走着，隐隐约约地看见了蠕动着的骆驼的峰顶，峰顶上驼毛的长须在迎风摆动。我想：快到了。果然，不多时，前面就露出了毡房的圆顶。
    朱根牛身高体阔，皮肤因经年风吹日晒变得深紫黝黑，宽大的脸膛上浮起一道道淡色的波纹。他刚完成了一趟运输任务回到毡房，我们就坐在卷起的铺盖上谈开了。
    这个骆驼队是旧国营焉耆种马场唯一的运输力量。运输任务最忙的季节是每年开春的时候。那时，要往山里为一百五十来人运粮食、油盐等生活日用品和毡房等用物，为种马、种羊运饲料。戈壁滩的春天气候变幻无常。当焉耆盆地树枝已经吐出了淡绿色的枝芽的时候，北部天山的尤鲁都斯草原遍地雪层还没有化完。有一次，骆驼队走到天山山麓，天气阴沉，风雪封锁道路，骆驼必须绕过雪窝行走；如果一时不慎，骆驼陷进雪里去，就有冻死的危险。在途中，骆驼绕不过雪窝的时候，他们就得用手把雪窝扒开用脚踩平，他们终于战胜了风雪，平安地翻过天山进入了草原。
    进入草原离目的地还有七十多里路，需要在途中宿夜。遍地一尺来厚的雪，怎么睡呢？他们卸下驮子，给骆驼放在沟道避风的地方，自己吃些干粮，打开铺盖，钻进被窝，蒙起头来就睡。天亮了，雪把人都埋上了。朱根牛从雪窝爬起来，头有些昏沉，四肢也显得很乏困，但是，他仍支持着跟着骆驼队直走到目的地把东西卸完。
    一年四季，他们总是这样不停地运输。去年，他们徒步走了两万里路以上，运输了二十万公斤的物资，上缴给国家的纯利润一万三千多元。
    我望着毡房内简陋的铺盖卷，铺在草地上的薄毡片，用铁架支起的架锅，问他们：“你们结婚没有？”他们回答说：“还没有，种马场刚建立工作忙呵！在停几年工作松缓些，再说吧！”（徐坦）（附图片）
