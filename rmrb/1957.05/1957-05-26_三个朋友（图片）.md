Three Friends

Zhang Fenglan, He Shulan, and Ding Jinglin were classmates at the No. 2 Xiaoguan Street Elementary School in Tianjin, graduating in 1952. After graduation, they went on to different jobs. Zhang Fenglan works as a waitress at the Tianjin Hotel, He Shulan is a nursery teacher at the Weiping Nursery, and Ding Jinglin is a bus conductor in Tianjin.

Initially, they all shared a common view, feeling that doing these jobs was "not glorious" and "had no future," fearing embarrassment if they ran into acquaintances at work. Coupled with unfamiliarity with the work, they felt it wasn't as good as doing something else. However, in practice, each of them refuted their past views and recognized the significance of their work. Now, they are performing very actively in their different positions and have also entered part-time middle school, soon to become junior high school graduates.

One day, they were invited back to their alma mater to talk with their former teachers about their situations after leaving school.

Zhang Fenglan, due to her willingness to delve into her work, is now a relatively skilled waitress and has developed an interest in her job. This is her serving dishes.

In her spare time, Zhang Fenglan doesn't slack off in her studies. She (center) often reviews her lessons with her comrades.

Ding Jinglin always helps passengers carrying children. Because their team works well, they were rated as an advanced team in the first quarter of this year.

He Shulan was also named a youth activist in her unit last year. She feels the greatest joy being with the children. This is her saying to a child: "Come and decorate this little family!" (All photos on this page are taken by reporters Yuan Yiping and Wang Zhiyuan of this newspaper)

    三个朋友
    张凤兰、何淑兰和丁景林是天津市小关大街第二小学1952年同班的高小毕业生。毕业以后，他们先后走上了不同的工作岗位。张凤兰在天津饭店做服务员，何淑兰在卫平托儿所当教养员，丁景林是天津市公共汽车售票员。
    当初，他们都有一个共同的看法，觉得干这种工作“不光荣”、“没前途”，怕在工作的时候碰上熟人丢丑，再加上业务生疏，使他们感到不如干别的工作强。可是，在实践中他们每个人都否定了过去的看法，认识了自己工作的意义。现在，他们在不同的工作岗位上表现得挺积极，又都进了业余中学，不久就将成为初中毕业生了。
    一天，他们应邀回到母校，和以前教过他们课的老师畅谈离校后的情况。

    张凤兰由于肯钻研业务，现在已经是一个比较熟练的服务员了，并且对自己的工作也发生了兴趣。这是她在上菜的情形。
    在业余时间里，张凤兰对学习也一点不放松。她（中）经常和同志们一起复习功课。
    丁景林每当遇到携带小孩的乘客，他总是来帮忙。由于他们车组同志工作好，今年第一季度被评为先进车组。
    何淑兰在去年也被评为本单位的青年积极分子。他感到和孩子们在一起是最大的愉快。这是她正对一个孩子说：“你来布置一下这个小家庭吧！”（本版照片都是本报记者袁毅平、王志渊摄）
