    [Chen Shizeng (1876-1923) was a famous Chinese painter. He lived in Beijing for many years and had a deep understanding of Beijing life. The Beijing Customs Picture Collection depicts the lives of many old Beijing laborers. It was rare for traditional Chinese painters to choose such life subjects for painting in the 1930s and 1940s.]

    〔陈师曾（1876—1923）是我国著名画家。他住北京多年，对北京生活有深刻体验。北京风俗图画集，描绘了许多老北京劳动人的生活。在三四十年前，选取这样的生活题材作画，在国画家中是少有的。〕
