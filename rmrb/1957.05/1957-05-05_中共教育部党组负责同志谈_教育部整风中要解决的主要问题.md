    (Dispatch by this newspaper) A responsible comrade of the CCP Ministry of Education Party Group met with reporters on the 4th of this month to discuss the main problems to be solved in the rectification movement of the Ministry of Education.

    The responsible comrade of the Ministry of Education Party Group said that many problems related to internal contradictions among the people are reflected in the work of general education. The following three aspects are more prominent:

    First, in recent years, primary and secondary schools have developed greatly in number. However, due to the annual sharp increase in the number of school-age children and primary school graduates, primary and secondary schools are far from meeting the needs of the people. The people demand that more schools be established, but the state is limited by economic and human resources, and it is not possible to establish so many in reality. This creates a contradiction between the needs of the people and what is possible.

    Second, the teaching quality of schools is not high, which cannot meet the requirements of students, creating conflicts between teaching and learning. At present, 50% of secondary school teachers and 37% of primary school teachers have not reached the required level; neglecting ideological and political education, too many courses, too heavy workload, inappropriate selection of materials, and too deep texts that students cannot accept are all important reasons for the low teaching quality.

    Third, the number of primary and secondary school graduates is increasing year by year. Except for a small number of people who can continue their studies, most people need to participate in agricultural production. However, many of them have incorrect views on participating in agricultural production. There is a contradiction between the thinking of graduates and the needs of the country.

    The emergence of the above contradictions is, in addition to objective reasons, inseparable from the serious bureaucracy and dogmatism of the Ministry of Education's leadership. For example, vacillation in the policy of mass collective education, insufficient attention to vocational and amateur education; relaxation of leadership over textbook compilation and review, which is crucial to improving teaching quality, and insufficient efforts to improve teachers; neglect of ideological and political education and labor education in schools; and mechanical application of foreign experience in running schools.

    The reason why the above three aspects of contradictions have not been properly handled is primarily because the leading cadres of the Ministry of Education have serious bureaucracy, being divorced from reality and the masses. In recent years, the leadership has been busy with administrative affairs, relaxing and neglecting ideological and political education, failing to conduct timely investigations and research, and failing to seriously consult with teachers and students on many major issues such as the school system, curriculum, and teaching materials. The connection with local education departments is also insufficient. Many teachers with teaching experience have not been well helped to summarize their experience. The teaching plans, textbooks, and teaching methods are either created behind closed doors based on subjective imagination, or mechanically copied from foreign experience, demonstrating serious dogmatism.

    Sectarianism also exists in the Ministry of Education. This is manifested in not letting go enough of non-Party members and not giving full play to their role in the people's education cause.

    Because the leadership of the Ministry of Education had many shortcomings in the past, problems could not be solved in a timely manner, and they accumulated. Within the Ministry of Education, there was a lack of ideological leadership in the past, ideological understanding was not unified, and there were many problems in the relationship between leaders and those being led, so that current work tasks cannot be smoothly implemented.

    The responsible comrade of the Party Group said: Since the beginning of this year, the problems existing in the work of the Ministry of Education have been exposed obviously, and we have also actively carried out the struggle against bureaucracy, trying to change our work style, but because we have not raised the problem to the height of contradictions among the people, we still cannot solve the problem fundamentally. Therefore, the Ministry of Education especially needs rectification. Only through rectification, seeking to solve problems ideologically, can we improve our work and correctly handle contradictions in education work. Although there are still difficulties in this rectification movement, thanks to the clear instructions from the Central Committee, the increased ideological awareness of cadres within the ministry, and the active and serious criticism of the ministry's shortcomings from relevant parties outside the ministry, we believe that our working conditions will be fundamentally changed.

    The responsible comrade of the Party Group said: The rectification movement of the Ministry of Education plans to proceed in four steps, namely, studying documents; examining and summarizing work; leading cadres examining their ideological style; and summarizing. It is expected to end before the end of the year. During the period of studying documents, Party members are required to understand the historical background and important significance of Chairman Mao's proposal of contradictions among the people, understand the principles of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and, on the basis of this ideology, combined with the actual situation of the Ministry of Education, understand what internal contradictions among the people exist in the work of the Ministry of Education, and how to correctly handle these contradictions. When summarizing the work of the past few years and examining the ideological style of the leadership, in addition to mobilizing all cadres within the ministry to offer opinions, we will also mobilize school teachers and relevant parties outside the ministry to offer criticisms of the work of the ministry.

### 中共教育部党组负责同志谈  教育部整风中要解决的主要问题

    中共教育部党组负责同志谈
    教育部整风中要解决的主要问题
    本报讯　本月4日，中共教育部党组负责同志接见记者，谈教育部在整风中要解决的主要问题。
    教育部党组负责同志说，人民内部矛盾反映到普通教育工作方面有很多问题，表现比较突出的有以下三个方面：
    第一，几年来，中小学在数量上有很大的发展；但由于学龄儿童入学数量和小学毕业生数量的逐年剧增，中小学远不能满足人民的要求。人民要求多多增办学校，而国家受着经济和人力的限制，事实上不可能增办那么多，这就产生了人民的需要同可能之间的矛盾。
    第二，学校的教学质量不高，不能满足学生的要求，教与学发生矛盾。现在，中学有50％、小学有37％的师资没有达到应有的水平；忽视思想政治教育，课程门类过多，分量过重，选材不恰当，课文过深，学生接受不了，这都是造成教学质量不高的重要原因。
    第三，中小学毕业生逐年增多，除一小部分人能够升学外，绝大部分人需要参加农业生产；但他们当中的很多人对参加农业生产有不正确的看法，毕业生的思想同国家的需要之间存在着矛盾。
    以上各种矛盾的产生，除了有客观原因以外，同教育部领导方面的严重的官僚主义、教条主义是分不开的。如对群众集体办学的方针摇摆、对职工业余教育不够重视；对有关提高教学质量带关键性的教材编审工作放松领导，对教师的提高抓得不紧；对学校思想政治教育与劳动教育忽视；在办学中机械搬运外国经验。
    以上三方面的矛盾所以没有得到正确的处理，首先是由于教育部领导干部有严重的官僚主义，脱离实际，脱离群众。几年来，领导上忙于行政事务，放松和忽视了思想政治教育，没有及时地进行调查研究，对于有关学制、课程及教材等许多重大问题，没有认真同教师和学生商量，同地方教育部门的联系也不够。对于很多有教学经验的教师，也没有很好地帮助他们总结经验。对于教学计划、教材以及教学方法等，不是闭门造车、凭主观想像办事，就是机械地搬运外国经验，表现了严重的教条主义。
    宗派主义在教育部也是存在的。这表现在对党外人士不够放手，没有很好地发挥他们在人民教育事业中的作用。
    由于教育部领导方面过去有很多毛病，问题不能及时解决，以致积累成堆。在教育部内部，过去缺乏思想领导，思想认识不统一，领导与被领导的关系也有很多问题，以致当前的工作任务不能顺利贯彻。
    党组负责同志说：今年以来，教育部工作中所存在的问题暴露得明显了，我们也积极开展了反官僚主义的斗争，想办法改变我们的工作面貌，但因为没有把问题提高到人民内部矛盾这样的高度来认识，仍不能从根本上解决问题。因此，教育部就特别需要整风。只有通过整风，求得从思想上解决问题，才能改进工作和正确处理教育工作中的矛盾。在这次整风中，虽然还有困难存在，但由于有中央明确的指示，部内干部思想认识的提高，部外有关方面对部的工作缺点积极的严肃的批评，相信会从根本上改变我们的工作状况的。
    党组负责同志说：教育部的整风运动打算分四个步骤进行，即学习文件；检查和总结工作；领导干部检查思想作风；总结。预计在年底以前结束。在学习文件期间，要求党员认识毛主席提出人民内部矛盾的历史背景和重要意义，明白正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，并在这一思想基础上，联系教育部的实际情况，认识在教育部工作中有哪些人民内部矛盾，应该如何正确地处理这些矛盾。在总结几年来工作和检查领导思想作风时，除发动部内全体干部提意见以外，还发动学校教师及部外有关方面对部的工作提出批评。
