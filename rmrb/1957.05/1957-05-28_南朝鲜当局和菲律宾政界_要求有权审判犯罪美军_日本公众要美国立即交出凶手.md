Xinhua News Agency, May 27th - Philippine politicians and Manila newspapers unanimously stated on the 25th that the United States must quickly resolve the issue of its jurisdiction in incidents involving American military personnel, or it will risk losing its friends among its allies in Southeast Asia.

They cited the Taipei demonstrations, the case of American soldier Girard's shooting of a Japanese woman in Japan, and the deadlocked dispute between the Philippines and the United States over the issue of jurisdiction as reasons why this issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible.

"The Manila Chronicle," referring to the Taipei demonstrations, said: "We Filipinos cannot help but see in this incident some of the factors that could cause something similar to happen here, if the Philippine government and the United States government allow the current deadlock on this fundamental issue related to the relations between the two countries to continue unresolved."

The newspaper said that the Taipei incident "should emphasize that, merely to prevent the possibility of the occurrence of such an indecent incident as in Taipei, it is necessary to definitively resolve all outstanding issues and differences in Philippine-American relations in the shortest possible time."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 27th - Seoul News: South Korean authorities are demanding that the United States sign an administrative agreement with them so that South Korea has the right to try American soldiers who commit crimes when they are off duty.

South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Jeong-hwan said that officials from both sides are discussing this issue, but the United States, on the grounds that Korea is still in a state of "temporary armistice," does not allow South Korean courts to try American soldiers in South Korea.

Cho Jeong-hwan revealed in April that the South Korean authorities have no jurisdiction over the foreign troops stationed in South Korea who are acting recklessly. Recently, the atrocities of American military police looting more than 300 residents in a village in Paju County, as well as frequent incidents of American soldiers insulting, beating, and shooting South Korean residents, are all matters over which the South Korean authorities have no power to intervene.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th - Tokyo News: The Japanese Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan today sent representatives to the American Embassy, demanding that the United States immediately hand over American soldier Girard, who shot and killed a Japanese woman, to Japan for trial.

Xinhua News Agency, May 26th - Tokyo News: Japanese Acting Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii said in Ise today that regardless of the opposition within the United States, Japan definitely has jurisdiction over the case of American soldier Girard shooting and killing a Japanese woman. He said that Japan will try this case and will not transfer it to the American authorities.

Japanese Defense Agency Director General Akira Kotaki also said in a speech in Tokushima City today that, according to the provisions of the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, the jurisdiction over the Girard case clearly belongs to the Japanese side.

### 南朝鲜当局和菲律宾政界  要求有权审判犯罪美军  日本公众要美国立即交出凶手

    南朝鲜当局和菲律宾政界
    要求有权审判犯罪美军
    日本公众要美国立即交出凶手
    据新华社27日讯　菲律宾政界人士和马尼拉报纸在25日一致认为，美国必须迅速解决它在牵连到美国军事人员的事件中的审判权问题，否则它将面临失去它在东南亚盟国中的朋友的危险。
    他们举出台北示威、日本美军哲腊德枪杀日本妇女案件和美菲关于裁判权问题的陷于僵局争执等等作为是有必要及早解决这个问题的理由。
      “菲律宾先驱报”在提到台北示威时说：“我们菲律宾人不禁在这一事件里看到了促成也可能在这里发生的事情的一些因素，如果菲律宾政府和美国政府让目前这一关系到两国关系的基本问题的僵局继续得不到解决的话。”
    这家报纸说，台北事件“应该着重说明，仅仅为了制止发生台北那种不体面事件的可能性，就有必要在尽可能短的时间里肯定地解决菲美关系中所有未决的悬案和分歧。”
    据新华社平壤27日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜当局要求美国同它签订一项行政协定，以便使南朝鲜有权审判那些在不值勤的时候犯罪的美国兵。
    南朝鲜的外务部长官曹正焕说，双方的官员正在讨论这个问题，但是美国以朝鲜还处在“暂时停战”的局面为理由，不允许南朝鲜法院审判在南朝鲜的美国兵。
    曹正焕曾经在4月间透露，南朝鲜当局对驻在南朝鲜的胡作非为的外国军队一直没有司法权。不久前发生的美国宪兵在坡州郡洗劫一个村庄的三百多家居民，以及经常发生的美军侮辱、殴打和枪杀南朝鲜居民的暴行，南朝鲜当局都无权过问。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和日本工会总评议会今天派代表到美国大使馆，要求美国立即把枪杀日本妇女的美国兵哲腊德交给日本审判。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本代理首相石井光次郎今天在伊势说，不管在美国内部有怎样的反对，日本对美国兵哲腊德枪杀一名日本妇女的案件肯定地具有审判权。他说，日本将对这个案子进行审判，而不把它移交给美国当局。
    日本防卫厅长官小泷彬今天在德岛市发表谈话时也说，根据日美行政协定的规定，哲腊德案件的审判权很显然是属于日本方面的。
