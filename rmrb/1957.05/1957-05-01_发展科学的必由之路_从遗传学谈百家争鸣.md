The Inevitable Path to Developing Science
——On the “Hundred Schools of Thought” from the Perspective of Genetics
Li Ruqi, Professor of Peking University

Editor's Note: This article was published in the Guangming Daily on April 29th. We have changed the original title to a subtitle and replaced it with a positive title, indicating our support for this article. We welcome thorough criticism of errors (all truly erroneous thoughts and measures should be thoroughly criticized) and the submission of appropriate constructive suggestions.

The "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has played a significant role in encouraging independent thinking, promoting the unity of scientists, and advancing scientific research from a genetic perspective. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why some people are still raising the issue of "loosening" versus "tightening." Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "The 'Hundred Schools of Thought' is a method for developing science and developing truth." My personal experience is that Chairman Mao's instructions are entirely correct. In academic matters, right and wrong can only be clarified through debate, hence the saying that truth becomes clearer through debate.

Since it is "Hundred Schools of Thought," it cannot be a "one school only." In the past, during our learning from the Soviet Union, if we committed a bit of formalism and dogmatism, it was that we only allowed "one school only." This was most prominent in genetics, and everyone is familiar with the consequences. "One school only" can only lead to ideological rigidity. Everyone learns to quote scriptures and parrot others, and over time, they unconsciously become intellectual lazybones. This kind of lazy thinking should be considered an obstacle in today's emphasis on advancing towards science, because what we need is independent thinking and originality. Obviously, to open up the minds of scientists, the "Hundred Schools of Thought" must be continued.

The "Hundred Schools of Thought" should also be considered the foundation for uniting scientists. From the perspective of genetics, through the Qingdao Conference last August, everyone spoke freely, debated, and aired their views. This greatly helped to address the mutual misunderstanding between the Michurin and Morgan schools and the different views on certain specific issues, bringing them closer together. In research and teaching, common ground has been preliminarily found through everyone's joint efforts. As a result, the two schools have to some extent achieved mutual respect and unity. Originally, there can only be one objective truth in science, and the common desire of scientists is to find this truth. It is conceivable that in the near future, through concrete research work, the two existing schools in genetics will gradually merge into one, that is to say, there will only be "family" and no "faction." I hope that all Chinese geneticists can take this as their goal and direction of effort, because when that time comes, we will achieve sincere unity.

Another gain of the Qingdao Conference in genetics was that everyone unanimously realized that to argue heatedly and express opinions loudly, it is necessary to present one's own data and raise questions based on one's own research. Therefore, after the conference, everyone started working and began research. It should also be pointed out here that genetic research may be somewhat different from other sciences, because it requires certain equipment and sufficient time for the studied organisms to reproduce and pass on their traits. Moreover, for workers of the Morgan school, their needs in this regard are particularly urgent, because our past foundation was relatively weak, and it has been abandoned for a long time. Now, even though some people have resumed work, it is still a new beginning after all. That is to say, in order to better promote genetic research, the problem is not that "loosening" is excessive, but how to "loosen" it even more, so that it can truly receive the sunshine and rain of the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

In the past, some people advocated that to debate, it must be within the framework of Marxism-Leninism. Now, some people are worried that the materialism that has been so easily established in China will be suppressed by the rising idealism. Regardless of whether this attitude towards Marxist materialism is correct, I feel that this view of opposing Marxism-Leninism to the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy is inappropriate. Because, according to my personal superficial understanding, in order to firmly establish the position of serving the people and establish a proletarian worldview, we must study Marxism-Leninism very well, which is beyond doubt. However, if we do not treat the political theory we have learned as dogma, but as a guide for our actions, then it is necessary to implement it into every detail of our daily life, into our teaching and research work. In fact, the true scientific attitude is to seek truth from facts, and seeking truth from facts is materialism. The true scientific method is to start from the big picture and focus on the details, working diligently and carefully analyzing every small problem. A good scientific method, of course, looks at problems from the perspective of universal connection and historical development; in a word, a good scientific method is a dialectical method. I believe that dialectical materialism is an objective truth drawn from scientific achievements, and then used to guide scientific research in reverse. Therefore, true science is inherently materialistic; and the correct research method is dialectical. Scientists, in order to better promote their research work, and in order to make their research results stand the test of practice, will consciously and actively study Marxism-Leninism and delve into their way of thinking. Scientific research and dialectical materialism are a natural and inevitable combination, rather than an accidental and forced one. I remember Lenin seemed to say that the ideological transformation of scientists must be achieved through their own work. This may be the reason. From this, it can be seen that political study and scientific research can be well unified; and the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy can play a very positive role in promoting the ideological transformation of scientists and promoting the study of Marxism-Leninism.

Finally, in order to carry out more heated debates in genetics, let me put forward two hopes and requirements. First, we urgently need time. The "time" here has two slightly different meanings: First, we need more time and more people's time to carry out research work, at least ensuring five-sixths of each week. The reason for raising this question is that recently everyone seems to have forgotten that we do have this need frequently, so various meetings have gradually become more frequent, and the time has been dragged on longer and longer. The other meaning of "time" is that good research work depends on the accumulation of a large amount of data, and depends on long-term, arduous, but extremely ordinary work. Therefore, it cannot be required to produce a certain quality product in a very short period of time.

Our second requirement is to expand the space, allowing us to carry out more contact and coordination work domestically, and to establish more exchanges between experts internationally. Due to the past emphasis on the importance of confidentiality, we could not help but have some concerns about direct personal communication with scholars in capitalist countries, and thus lost contact over a long period of time. Recently, we have put forward the slogan of catching up with the international level, but we have not even figured out what the current international level is in some departments of genetics. If this continues, we will inevitably build cars behind closed doors, wasting a lot of time exploring. Of course, we have an agency in charge of foreign cultural liaison, and such things can be done through them. However, backlogs or even lost items are inevitable here, and the procedures are cumbersome, which cannot give us much encouragement. Therefore, I very much hope to receive clear instructions and sufficient conditions to conduct personal contact with foreign experts. This is beneficial to the development of our science.

    发展科学的必由之路
    ——从遗传学谈百家争鸣
    北京大学教授  李汝祺
    本报编者按  这篇文章载在4月29日的光明日报，我们将原题改为副题，替作者换了一个肯定的题目，表示我们赞成这篇文章。我们欢迎对错误作彻底的批判（一切真正错误的思想和措施都应批判干净），同时提出恰当的建设性的意见来。
    中共中央所提出的百家争鸣的方针，从遗传学上来看，对于鼓励独立思考、促进科学家的团结以及推动科学研究等，都起到了很大的作用；因而也就难于理解为什么现在还有人提出“放”与“收”的问题。毛主席一再教导我们说：“百家争鸣是发展科学，发展真理的方法。”我个人体会，毛主席的这样的指示是完全正确的。在学术方面，是非曲直，惟有通过争辩才能搞得清清楚楚，所以真理愈辩愈明就是这个道理。
    既然百家争鸣，就不能一家独鸣。在过去我们学习苏联的过程中，如果说我们犯了一点形式主义与教条主义，那就是只许一家独鸣。这在遗传学方面，表现的最为突出，其后果如何是大家所熟习的。一家独鸣只能引起思想僵化。大家都学会引经据典，人云亦云，久而久之，在不知不觉中就会变成思想懒汉。这种懒汉思想，在强调向科学进军的今天，应该说是一种障碍，因为我们所需要的是独立思考、独出心裁。显而易见，为了使科学家的思想开放，就必须把百家争鸣继续下去。
    百家争鸣也应该认为是使科学家团结起来的基础。从遗传学方面的情况来看，通过去年8月的青岛会议，大家畅所欲言，争了一场，鸣了一番，对目前存在的米丘林和摩尔根两个学派间的互不了解以及对某些具体问题的不同的看法，都得到很大的帮助，使他们逐渐接近。在研究及教学方面，通过大家的共同努力，也初步找到了共同的基础。这样一来，两个学派多少作到了互相尊重、互相团结。本来，科学的客观真理，只能有一个，而科学家的共同愿望就是寻找这个真理。可以想像，不久的将来，通过具体的研究工作，遗传学中目前存在的两个学派，会逐渐融合为一，那就是说只有“家”而没有“派”。我希望所有的中国遗传学工作者都能以此为奋斗的目标和努力的方向，因为到了那个时期，我们就会作到真诚的团结。
    青岛会议在遗传学上的另外一个收获，是使大家一致认识到要争得热烈、鸣得响亮，就必须拿出自己的资料，在自己的研究的基础上提出问题。因此，在会议之后大家都动起手来，开始进行研究工作。在这里也应该指出，遗传学的研究工作可能与其他科学有些不同，因为必须有一定的设备和充分的时间，才能够使所研究的生物能够繁殖和传代。而且就摩尔根学派的工作者来说，他们对这方面的需要尤为迫切，因为我们过去的基础就比较薄弱，近来又被放弃了一个较长的时期。现在纵然有一些人已经恢复工作，但毕竟还是一个新的开端。这就是说，为了更好地推动遗传学的研究，问题绝不是“放”的过多而是如何“放”得更多一些，使它真正能够得到百家争鸣方针的阳光和甘霖。
    过去有人主张要争鸣就必须在马克思列宁主义之内来争鸣；现在又有人担心，好容易在中国建立起来的唯物主义，又要被抬起头来的唯心主义给压下去了。这样对待马克思唯物主义的态度是否正确，姑且不论，但是这种把马克思列宁主义和百家争鸣的方针对立起来的看法，我觉得是不恰当的。因为照我个人粗浅的体会，为了坚定为人民服务的立场和建立无产阶级的宇宙观，我们一定要很好地学习马克思列宁主义，这是无可争论的。但是如果不把所学的政治理论当作教条来看待，而把它当作我们行动的指南，那就有必要把它贯彻到我们的日常生活每一个细节之中，贯彻到我们的教学与研究工作之中。实际上，真正科学的态度就是实事求是，而实事求是就是唯物主义的。真正的科学方法就是从大处着眼、小处着手，兢兢业业，对每个小问题都加以仔细的分析。好的科学方法当然是从普遍联系与历史发展看问题；一句话，好的科学方法也就是辩证的方法。我认为辩证唯物主义是由科学的成就中抽出来的客观真理，然后再用它反转过来指导科学研究的。因此，真正的科学，它本身就是唯物的；正确的研究方法，也就是辩证的。科学家为了更好地推动自己的研究工作，为了使自己研究的成果经得起实践的考验，就一定会自觉地、主动地去学习马克思列宁主义和钻研他们的思想方法。科学研究和辩证唯物主义是自然和必然的结合，而不是偶然和勉强的结合。我记得列宁好像这样说过，科学家的思想改造，必须通过他自己的工作。可能就是这个道理。由此可见，政治学习与科学研究是可以很好地统一起来的；而百家争鸣的方针对于促进科学家的思想改造和推动对马克思列宁主义的学习，可以起到很大的积极作用。
    最后，为了在遗传学方面进行更热烈的争鸣，让我提出两点希望和要求。第一，我们迫切需要时间。这里的“时间”有两个略为不同的含义：首先，我们需要更多的时间和更多人的时间来进行研究工作，至少保证每周的六分之五。这个问题的提出是因为近来大家好像忘记了我们确实而且经常有这种需要，因而各种会又渐渐开的多起来，时间又拖的长起来了。“时间”的另一个含义是搞好研究工作要靠大量资料的积累，要靠长期的、艰苦的、但极其平凡的工作。这样就不能要求在很短的时间内，拿出一定质量的成品。
    我们的第二个要求是扩大空间，容许我们在国内进行更多的联系和协调工作，在国际多建立专家之间的交往。由于过去强调保密工作的重要性，不能不使我们对资本主义国家的学者在个人直接通讯上存在着一些顾虑，因而长期下来也就失掉联系。最近我们提出赶上国际水平的口号，但是遗传学方面的某些部门，目前的国际水平究竟是什么，连我们自己都还没有摸清。长此下去，势必闭门造车，要浪费很多摸索的时间。当然，我们有一个专管对外文化联络的机构，这样的事可以通过他们去搞。但是这里积压情况甚至丢失事件，是在所难免，而且手续繁琐，不能给我们多少鼓励。因此，我很希望能够得到明确的指示和充分的条件向国外专家进行个人联系。这与发展我们的科学是有好处的。
