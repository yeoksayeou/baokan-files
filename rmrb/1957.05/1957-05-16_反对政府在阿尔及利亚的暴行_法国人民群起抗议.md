Xinhua News Agency, May 15th dispatch from Paris: According to a report in "l'Humanité," residents of Grenoble responded to the call of more than two hundred prominent social and political activists in the city against the atrocities of the French authorities in Algeria, and held a large-scale demonstration on the evening of May 10th.

    At the call of the People's Relief Association of the Gironde province of France, residents of Bordeaux also held a mass rally on May 11 to oppose the use of repressive means in Algeria.

    The French authorities are suppressing this movement of the people. The Paris Court sentenced the director of "l'Humanité," Gilbert Bellisard, and the newspaper's cartoonist, Liso Mittelberg, to a fine of 100,000 francs each on May 12 because "l'Humanité" published a cartoon by Mittelberg in June 1955 depicting a French paratrooper staring at a dead Algerian at his feet.

    The French authorities are also persecuting a group of progressive people and Communists who distributed leaflets demanding an end to the Algerian War. The authorities have brought charges against four Communist Party members in the Parisian suburbs of Neuilly and Ivry.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th dispatch from Paris: The acting General Secretary of the French Socialist Party, Guy Mollet, admitted that the "pacification" policy implemented by the government in Algeria has aroused protests from the broad masses of the French people.

    Mollet made this admission in a report at the meeting of the National Committee of the French Socialist Party held on the 12th. The National Committee, composed of members of parliament and representatives of local organizations, spent most of the meeting on criticisms of the Algerian policy by some representatives.

    反对政府在阿尔及利亚的暴行
    法国人民群起抗议
    据新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：据“人道报”报道，格累诺布尔居民响应了该市二百多个著名社会和政治活动家提出的反对法国当局在阿尔及利亚的暴行的呼吁，在5月10日晚间举行了大规模的示威游行。
    在法国吉隆德省人民救济会的号召下，波尔多居民在5月11日也举行了群众集会，反对在阿尔及利亚采用镇压手段。
    法国当局正在压制人民的这种运动。巴黎法院在5月12日判决“人道报”社长基尔曼·贝利西埃和该报漫画家利索·米帖耳柏格每人交纳鄂金十万法郎，因为“人道报”曾经在1955年6月刊登了米帖耳柏格的一幅描写一个法国伞兵凝视着他脚下的一个死了的阿尔及利亚人的漫画。
    法国当局并且还对一批散发过要求结束阿尔及利亚战争的传单的进步人士和共产党人进行迫害。当局对巴黎市郊奈伊和伊弗里区四名共产党员提起公诉。
    新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：法国社会党代理总书记戈曼承认，政府在阿尔及利亚实行的“绥靖”政策，已经引起了法国广大人士的抗议。
    戈曼是在12日举行的法国社会党全国委员会会议上作报告时承认这点的。全国委员会由议员和地方组织的代表组成，这次会议的大部分时间用在一些代表对阿尔及利亚政策的批评上。
