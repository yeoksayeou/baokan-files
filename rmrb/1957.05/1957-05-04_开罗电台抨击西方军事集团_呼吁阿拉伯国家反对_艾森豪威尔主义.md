    Cairo Radio Attacks Western Military Blocs
    Calls on Arab Nations to Oppose "Eisenhower Doctrine"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Cairo dispatch) Cairo Radio on the 2nd severely condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, demanding that Arab nations oppose the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine.

    Cairo Radio's broadcast pointed out that the North Atlantic group demonstrates that "Western Europe is completely America's political, economic, and military slave," and the Baghdad Pact displays the same "slavery." It called on Arab nations to oppose "existing, planned, and foreign-concluded alliances."

    The broadcast also pointed out that although Britain has economic difficulties, it cannot increase trade with China without American "consent." When Western Europe lacked oil due to the Suez Canal being blocked, American oil companies raised their prices and demanded payment in US dollars.

    In discussing the Baghdad Pact, Cairo Radio said: In one member country—Iran—the cabinet had to resign because three American citizens were killed, "although many Americans are often murdered in Chicago and elsewhere in the United States"; in another Baghdad Pact country—Iraq—two airfields had to be built for British bombers to bomb Egypt; and in the third member country—Turkey—it had to devote its economy entirely to military spending, sending troops to the border of its neighbor (Syria) to exert political pressure.

    开罗电台抨击西方军事集团
    呼吁阿拉伯国家反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    本报讯　据开罗消息：开罗电台2日严厉谴责北大西洋公约组织，要求阿拉伯国家反对巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义。
    开罗电台的广播指出，北大西洋集团表明“西欧完全是美国的政治、经济和军事奴隶”，巴格达条约表现出同样的“奴隶性”。它号召阿拉伯国家反对“现存的计划中的和外国缔结的联盟”。
    广播并且指出：英国尽管有经济困难，但是非经美国“同意”却不能增加同中国的贸易。在西欧由于苏伊士运河不通而缺乏石油的时候，美国各石油公司却提高它们的格价并且要求付给美元。
    开罗电台在谈到巴格达条约时说：在一个成员国——伊朗国内，由于三个美国公民被杀，内阁不得不辞职，“虽然有许多美国人常常在美国的芝加哥和其他地方被谋害”；在另一个巴格达条约国家——伊拉克，不得不建立两个飞机场供英国轰炸机轰炸埃及使用；而在第三个成员国——土耳其，则不得不把它的经济完全用于军事开支，派遣军队到邻（叙利亚）边境上去施加政治压力。
