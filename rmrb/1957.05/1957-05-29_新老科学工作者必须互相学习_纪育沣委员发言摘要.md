New and Old Scientific Workers Must Learn From Each Other
Excerpts from Speech by Committee Member Ji Yufeng

　　I have been engaged in chemical research for nearly thirty years. I have selected my research fields: (1) the study of heterocyclic compounds pyrimidine and thiazole; (2) the extraction and structure research of alkaloids in traditional Chinese medicine. The reason I have been able to achieve some results is nothing more than having a spirit of perseverance and overcoming difficulties to continue research. Another most important condition is that many young scientific workers are willing to listen to my guidance, so that research results can be completed.

　　Although I have some research achievements in pyrimidine and thiazole, I cannot be proud and complacent because of this. I should still maintain that spirit of perseverance and continue to move forward to seek further improvement. Should young comrades follow my example? Our thinking as older scientific workers may not be as advanced as that of young comrades, but the spirit of hard work and diligent research is something that young comrades cannot match. We should learn from each other's strengths to make up for our weaknesses.

　　Compared with the Kuomintang's rule, the equipment and facilities in our country's current research institutes and university laboratories are vastly different. I envy our young comrades for being born in this happy Mao Zedong era. Today, young comrades have the latest equipment and ample research funding, so they should do better research work and obtain better research results. If young comrades have enthusiasm for research work, coupled with a spirit of hard work and diligent research, and humbly accept the guidance of older scientific workers, it is not a problem to catch up with international standards within twelve years.

　　The sensitivity and enthusiasm of young comrades are indeed something that our older scientific workers should learn from. However, when young comrades plan research topics, they only know to consult the literature. After collecting a large amount of literature, they do not use their brains to think deeply and analyze the problems existing in the work of their predecessors. They only know how to imitate and repeat the work of others, thinking that they can solve some scientific problems related to the national economy. This will not solve the problems. Our older scientific workers have shortcomings and also have advantages. Young comrades should learn our advantages. The Party and the government call on our older scientific workers and young comrades to unite and jointly march towards the scientific fortress. If we each contribute our own advantages, we will definitely be able to do research work better and it will be easier to solve the scientific problems that the country needs to solve. I am now determining my own research direction. On the one hand, I will respond to the call of the Party and the government, combine my own expertise, and cooperate with the tasks assigned to me by the government to solve some scientific problems related to the national economy. On the other hand, I will continue my research on pyrimidine and thiazole. At present, heavy organic synthesis in China is still a blank spot. I am willing to focus on studying the scientific problems in the field of heavy organic synthesis in my own research plan, and correspondingly continue to study the scientific problems in the field of light organic synthesis. I believe that under these superior research conditions, with a large number of young comrades working with me for a long time, we will definitely be able to catch up with international standards in the shortest time.

　　To this end, I have two suggestions: (1) Solve the contradictions between scientific workers who have just returned from abroad and older scientific workers: Older scientific workers have a large number of young cadres under them whom they have painstakingly trained. Older scientific workers want to become a school of thought in the world (not a sect), and young cadres are supporting roles in their work. Leaders should not transfer their supporting roles to serve as assistants to scientific workers who have just returned from abroad. I suggest to Party member leading cadres: they should consider how to assign young cadres who have just graduated from university to scientific workers who have just returned from abroad as assistants; and they should consider how to assign scientific workers who have just returned from abroad to do research work within the guidance of older scientific workers under the principle of voluntariness. In order to develop their expertise and complete the tasks assigned by the government, older scientific workers must automatically unite with scientific workers who have just returned from abroad and voluntarily allocate the assistants they have trained. (2) Party member leading cadres should adopt the opinions of domestic experts no less than the opinions of foreign experts.

　　Finally, let me talk about whether the Party can lead natural science: I think the Party can lead in the past, present and future. But how to lead? First of all, leading Party members should have a considerable understanding of the development of various natural sciences in the world; at the same time, they should conduct a detailed investigation in advance on which domestic older scientists and experts who have just returned from abroad have what kind of expertise, and then give them corresponding tasks and trust them. If they don't understand, they shouldn't pretend to understand. They should respect the business research direction of non-Party scientists and humbly learn from them; they should establish relationships with them, so that Party members and non-Party members have a common language. In this way, not only will government policies and guidelines be easily implemented, but the thinking of non-Party members will also be easily advanced.

　　No natural scientist can be proficient in all natural sciences, especially today when professions are divided very finely, it is even more difficult to do so. Therefore, leaders must solicit the opinions of all experts, concentrate them, draw conclusions, and then point out the direction of leadership. This is how the Party leads natural science. I believe that the Communist Party members have the glorious tradition of overcoming all difficulties in the past, and will surely cultivate many red experts to achieve the goal of the Party directly leading science in the future.

### 新老科学工作者必须互相学习  纪育沣委员发言摘要

    新老科学工作者必须互相学习
    纪育沣委员发言摘要
    我从事化学研究工作，将近三十年了。我选定了自己的研究领域：（一）杂环化合物嘧啶和噻唑的研究；（二）中药中生物碱之提取和结构的研究。我之能够获得一些成绩，不外于有百折不挠的精神，克服困难继续从事研究。还有一个最重要的条件，就是许多青年科学工作者，愿意听从我的指导，得以完成研究成果。
    我对嘧啶和噻唑虽有一些研究成绩，但不能因此骄傲自满，仍应当保持那百折不挠的精神，继续前进，以求深造。青年工作同志们应否向我看齐呢？我们老科学工作者的思想或许没有青年工作同志们的前进，但是刻苦钻研的精神则是年青同志们所不及。我们彼此应当取长补短。
    我国目前各研究所和各大学的实验室的仪器设备和国民党掌权时代相比较，确有天壤之别。我羡慕我们年青同志生于此幸福的毛泽东时代。今日青年工作同志有了最新式的仪器设备，和大笔的研究经费，那么应当做更好的研究工作，得到更优良的研究成果。青年工作同志们对于研究工作有积极性，如果加上刻苦钻研的精神，虚心受老科学工作者的指导，于十二年内赶上国际水平，那是不成问题的。
    青年工作同志有敏感性及积极性，确是我们年老科学工作者应当学习的地方；但是青年工作同志们在计划研究题目时，仅知道查考文献，在收集大批文献后，没有去开动脑筋深刻思考，分析前人工作中存在的问题，只知道依样画葫芦，重复他人工作，以为可以解决一些国民经济中的有关科学问题。这样是不能解决问题的。我们老科学工作者有缺点也有优点，青年工作同志们应该学习我们的优点。党和政府号召我们年老科学工作者和青年工作同志团结一致共同向科学堡垒进军，如果各自贡献自己的优点，必定能使研究工作做得更好，必更容易解决国家所要解决的科学问题，我现在确定我自己的研究方向，一方面响应党和政府的号召，结合自己的专长，去配合政府分配给我的任务，解决一些国民经济有关的科学问题；另一方面，继续我的嘧啶和噻唑的研究。现在国内重有机合成，尚是一个空白点，我愿意在我自己的研究计划中，重点地研究重有机合成领域中的科学问题，相应地继续研究轻有机合成领域中的科学问题。我相信在这优越的研究条件之下，有大批的青年同志，长期与我共同研究，在最短时间内，一定可以迎头赶上国际水平。
    为此，我有两点建议：（一）解决新从国外回来的科学工作者与年老科学工作者间的矛盾问题：老科学工作者手下有大批他自己苦心训练出来的年青干部，老科学工作者要成为世界上的一学派（并非宗派），年青干部是他工作上的配角，领导不应调他的配角去充当新从国外回来的科学工作者的助理员。我向党员领导干部建议：应多考虑如何分配刚从大学毕业的年青干部给新从国外回来的科学工作者为助理员；更应如何考虑分配新从国外回国的科学工作者在自愿的原则下在老科学工作者的指导范围内，去做研究工作。老科学工作者为了发展自己的专长及完成政府分配的任务，必须自动去团结新从国外回国的科学工作者，自愿分配他所训练好的助理员。（二）党员领导干部，采纳国内专家的意见，应不亚于采纳外国专家的意见。
    最后，我来谈谈党能否领导自然科学的问题：我觉得过去、现在和将来党均能领导。但是如何领导呢？首先领导党员应对世界各自然科学的发展情况有相当的了解；同时对国内老科学家及新从国外回国的专家谁具有何种专长，应预先作详细的调查，然后给以相当的任务并信任之，自己不懂不可装懂。应尊重非党科学家的业务研究方针，虚心向他学习；应与之建立感情，做到党员与非党员有共同的语言，这样，不但政府政策方针容易执行，而非党员的思想也容易前进。
    任何自然科学工作者，不能对自然科学门门精通，尤在今日专业分得非常精细更难办到。所以领导者，必须征求所有专家的意见。将之集中起来，得出结论，然后指出领导方向。这就是党在领导自然科学。我相信共产党员具有过去那种没有克不服的困难的光荣传统，必能培养出许多红色专家，达到将来党直接领导科学的目的。
