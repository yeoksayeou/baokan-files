Mr. Worth's "Human Nature"
　　
　　American journalist William Worthy recently published his impressions of his visit to China in the "New York Post."
　　
　　According to Mr. Worthy, in China, "begging men, women, and children have returned to this profession." He heard "rumors" that "prostitutes are emerging from hibernation again," and that "anti-gambling is not so strict anymore."
　　
　　It is undeniable that in our land of bright sunshine, there are still some dark corners and remnants of the old society, and the people's lives still face some difficulties. After all, it has only been six or seven years since we drove out the imperialists and reactionaries from the mainland, and it is impossible to eradicate the carbuncles and wounds they left behind immediately. We are fighting to completely eliminate these backward phenomena. Although these phenomena have been basically eliminated today, in the hands of Mr. Worthy, who uses a microscope to find faults everywhere, they can be considered good material for the "darkness of Red China."
　　
　　It seems that Mr. Worthy regards it as the most satisfactory "gain" during his visit to China.
　　
　　Who says that American journalists only maliciously slander the "Communist government" as being dictatorial and autocratic? Here, he finally discovered this government's "tendency to satisfy the lowest requirements of human nature"!
　　
　　However, regrettably, most native-born Chinese people who are unfamiliar with the American way of life probably find it difficult to understand Mr. Worthy's language. They have always known that beggars are a phenomenon caused by poverty in old China, prostitutes are products of the sinful system of feudal and capitalist societies, and gambling is an immoral behavior. As for the relationship between these ugly things and the "lowest requirements of human nature," it is unheard of. In the past few years since liberation, they have seen countless homeless beggars become self-reliant laborers, countless prostitutes who used to live in a dark and miserable life become female workers, tractor drivers, nursery workers, and housewives, and countless reckless gamblers have been reformed. However, according to Mr. Worthy, all of these are supposedly actions that stifle the "lowest requirements of human nature."
　　
　　What is the "human nature" in Mr. Worthy's writing? It is whoring, gambling, and drinking, and these are the "lowest requirements" of "human nature"! If you want to prohibit, ban, and reform these, you are stifling "human nature"! Readers, don't laugh. What Mr. Worthy said is not nonsense, but genuine American-made human nature theory. In their dictionary, licentiousness, drinking, gambling, robbery, murder... have always been synonymous with "morality" and "human nature." The American civilization promoted by Hollywood movies is these things, and the American civilization in Dulles' mouth is also these things. Mr. Worthy traveled thousands of miles to China, just like someone who has lived in a fish market entering a room of orchids. The vigorous socialist construction and various new phenomena being carried out by the people of New China cannot but make him feel headache and uncomfortable. Only those few remaining dark spots finally gave him a sense of surprise as if he had "met an old friend in a foreign land." Unfortunately, it is still far from the stinking corners of Broadway and Hollywood, so he had to add an additional phrase "lowest requirements" to "human nature."
　　
　　Thank you, Mr. Worthy. He is indeed an honest voluntary teacher—like Acheson, he lets us once again understand what the so-called "American civilization" and "humanitarianism of the free world" are all about.

    沃西先生笔下的“人性”
    敬宜
    美国记者威廉·沃西，最近在“纽约邮报”上发表了一篇访华观感。
    据沃西先生说，在中国，“行乞的男女儿童又重新干这个行业了”，据他听“谣传”，“又能遇到从冬眠中出来的妓女了”，还有，“不那么严格地反赌博了”。
    在我们光明普照的土地上，今天还存在一些阴暗的角落、一些旧社会的渣滓，人民的生活也还有一些困难，这是无庸讳言的事。因为我们把帝国主义、反动派赶出大陆，不过六、七年的光景，他们留下的痈疽、创伤还不可能马上铲除净尽。我们正在为彻底消灭这些落后现象而斗争。尽管这些现象今天已经基本上被消灭了，但是到了拿着显微镜到处找毛病的沃西先生手里，毕竟可算得作为“红色中国的黑暗”的好资料。
    看来，沃西先生把它当作在华访问期间感到最满意的“收获”了。
    谁说美国记者只会恶意中伤“共产党政府”如何专制、独裁呢？这里他总算发现了这个政府“想满足人性的最低要求的倾向”！
    不过，遗憾得很，大多数土生土长、不熟悉美国生活方式的中国人民，恐怕是很难懂得沃西先生的语言的。他们向来只知道乞丐是旧中国贫穷造成的现象，娼妓是封建社会、资本主义社会罪恶制度下的产物，赌博是不道德的行为，至于这些丑恶的东西和“人性的最低要求”还有关系，实在是前所未闻。解放这几年来，他们看到无数无家可归的乞丐成了自食其力的劳动者，无数过去过着暗无天日的痛苦生活的妓女，成了女工、拖拉机手、保育员、家庭妇女，无数胡天胡地的赌棍得到了改造。但是，据沃西先生看来，所有这些，据说都是扼杀“人性的最低要求”的行动。
    沃西先生笔下的“人性”是什么呢？就是嫖妓，赌博，酗酒，而且这些都是“最低要求”的“人性”！你要禁止、取缔、改造这些，你就是要扼杀“人性”！读者莫要发笑，沃西先生说的并非糊涂话，而是货真价实的美国制人性论。在他们的辞典里、淫乱、酗酒、赌博、抢劫、凶杀……，向来就是“道德”“人性”的同义语。好莱坞电影宣传的美国文明是这些，杜勒斯口中的美国文明也是这些。沃西先生不远千里来到中国，正如久居鲍鱼之肆的人走入芝兰之室，新中国人民进行着的蓬勃的社会主义建设和各种新气象，不能不使他感到头痛和不舒服。只有那几个残余的黑点，总算使他发生了“他乡遇故知”般的惊喜之感。可惜的是和百老汇、好莱坞那些腥臭的角落比起来还差得很远，所以只好在“人性”上加上一个附加语：“最低要求的”了。
    感谢沃西先生，他不失为一个老实的义务教员——像艾奇逊那样，让我们再一次懂得了所谓“美国文明”、“自由世界的人道主义”等等究竟是些什么货色。
