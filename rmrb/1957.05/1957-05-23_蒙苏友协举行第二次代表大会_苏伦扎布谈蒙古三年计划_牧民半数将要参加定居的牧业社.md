Xinhua News Agency Reports: The Second Congress of the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Association began on the 20th in Ulaanbaatar and closed on the 21st. At the opening ceremony, Dongharzhab, Chairman of the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Association, said that the Mongolian and Soviet people have a friendship of thirty-six years, and the Soviet people have not only helped Mongolia in economic construction, but also shed blood for Mongolia's independence. Dongharzhab asked the association's leaders to go deeper into the grassroots in the future and to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union well in light of Mongolia's actual situation.

Tsedenbal, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, reported on Mongolia's three-year plan from 1958 to 1960 at the congress on the 21st. Tsedenbal said that in order to put Mongolia's pastoral economy on the road of socialist development, the Party Central Committee decided that by the end of 1960, 50% of the herders should join pastoral production cooperatives (Mongolia now has more than 600 cooperatives, and the herders participating in the cooperatives account for more than 22% of the country's herders), and the herders should gradually settle down, requiring 150 to 200 settled pastoral cooperatives within three years. Tsedenbal said that the Soviet Union's assistance to Mongolia in the recent Mongolian-Soviet talks mainly helped Mongolia carry out the construction of the three-year plan. The tractors and other equipment supplied by the Soviet Union will be used to develop agricultural production and create favorable conditions for herders to settle down. He said that it is not enough to just settle down, but it is necessary to further improve livestock and increase the yield and quality of livestock products. Mongolia plans to use the 10,000 head of improved breeds of livestock provided by the Soviet Union to breed 2.9 million head of hybrid livestock within three years.

After Tsedenbal's speech, the congress adopted a report on revising the association's charter and elected new leaders. The congress was then declared closed.

    蒙苏友协举行第二次代表大会
    苏伦扎布谈蒙古三年计划
    牧民半数将要参加定居的牧业社
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：蒙苏友好协会第二次代表大会，20日在乌兰巴托开始举行，21日闭幕。在开幕会上，蒙苏友协主席东哈尔扎布说，蒙苏人民有着三十六年的友谊，苏联人民不仅在经济上帮助蒙古建设，并且曾经为蒙古的独立流过血。东哈尔扎布要求协会的负责人今后要多深入下层，并且要结合蒙古的实际情况很好地学习苏联的先进经验。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第二书记苏伦扎布，21日在大会上报告了蒙古从1958年到1960年的三年计划。苏伦扎布说，为了使蒙古的牧业经济走上社会主义发展的道路，党中央决定到1960年年底要使50％的牧民加入牧业生产合作社（蒙古现在有六百多个合作社，参加合作社的牧民占全国牧民的22％以上），并且要使牧民逐步定居下来，要求在三年内有一百五十到二百个定居的牧业社。苏伦扎布说，苏联在不久前举行的蒙苏会谈中给予蒙古的援助，主要是帮助蒙古进行三年计划的建设。苏联供应的拖拉机等将用来发展农业生产，给牧民定居创造良好条件。他说，仅仅定居还不够，要进一步改良牲畜、提高畜产品的产量和质量。蒙古准备利用苏联给予的一万头良种牲畜，在三年内繁殖杂交种牲畜二百九十万头。
    在苏伦扎布发言以后，大会通过了修改协会章程的报告，选举了新的负责人。大会至此宣布闭幕。
