Xinhua News Agency report: According to Xinhua News Agency, after Saudi Arabian King Saud and Iraqi King Faisal held talks in Baghdad, they issued a joint communiqué on the 18th stating that the two countries "agree to uphold the principles of the Arab League, the principles of the Collective Security Pact, and the principles of the resolutions of the United Nations and the Bandung Conference."

The communiqué stated that both sides are determined to "oppose foreign interference in internal affairs, oppose Zionism, and oppose destructive theories and the imperialist dangers threatening Arab countries." The two sides decided to "continue to implement the treaties and agreements concluded between the two countries in the past."

The joint communiqué also stated, "The two sides agree to do everything possible to unite the ranks of Arab countries." "The two sides unanimously believe that no Arab country should interfere in the internal affairs of another Arab country."

The communiqué stated that the final solution to the Palestine issue is "the only way to restore peace and stability in the Middle East." Both sides agreed to guarantee the rights of Arab countries in the Gulf of Aqaba and are determined to do everything possible to prevent Israel from infringing upon these rights. They also pledged to support "the Algerians fighting for independence and freedom as much as possible."

King Saud's visit to Iraq is the first time he has visited as head of state, and there has always been a feud between the royal families of the two countries. Recently, the United States has been trying to bring the two countries closer together, attempting to organize a pro-Western Arab group in the Middle East, isolate Egypt and Syria, in order to promote the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East. Iraq, a participant in the Baghdad Pact, has been assigned as the executor of this plan.

However, according to the Indian Press Trust, Baghdad diplomatic circles believe that Saudi Arabia did not reach a complete agreement with Iraqi King Faisal and Prime Minister Said on the issue of participating in the Western alliance. They believe that Saudi Arabia's reluctance to become too involved in the Western alliance led to the cancellation of Jordan's King's planned participation in the Baghdad meeting.

The Saudi Arabia-Iraq meeting joint communiqué has aroused different reactions in Syrian public opinion. The government has not made any comments, progressive newspapers have published editorials expressing opposition, while newspapers considered conservative have only published the communiqué and avoided commenting.

"Al-Jamahir" pointed out that the Iraq-Saudi Arabia joint communiqué avoids mentioning positive neutralism, but expresses its desire to combat so-called subversive doctrines, Zionism, and imperialism. But how can one agree with such contradictory statements? How can one believe that Iraq, a member of the imperialist Baghdad Pact, will fight against imperialism?

"Al-Balad" pointed out that Arab countries have already replaced the Arab Collective Defense Pact with bilateral military agreements. Now the communiqué says it wants to restore the latter, which for Saudi Arabia is equivalent to abandoning the military agreement concluded with Egypt.

Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai welcomed the joint communiqué issued after the meeting between the Kings of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He said: This communiqué is a gratifying and significant development in the relationship between the Hashemite and Saudi royal families. According to him, this development is in the best interests of all Arab countries.

    沙伊两国国王发表联合公报
    同意尽力团结阿拉伯国家
    叙“群众报”认为公报内容自相矛盾
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特同伊拉克国王费萨尔在巴格达举行会谈以后，18日发表联合公报说，两国“同意维护阿拉伯联盟的原则、集体安全公约的原则以及联合国和万隆会议决议的原则”。
    公报说，双方决心“反对外国干涉内政，反对犹太复国主义，反对破坏性的理论和威胁着阿拉伯国家的帝国主义危险”。双方决定“继续执行两国在过去缔结的条约和协定”。
    联合公报还说，“双方同意尽一切力量团结阿拉伯国家的队伍”。“双方一致认为，任何阿拉伯国家都不应该干涉另外一个阿拉伯国家的内政”。
    公报说，巴勒斯坦问题的最后解决是“再一次恢复中东的和平和稳定的唯一方法”。双方同意保障阿拉伯国家在亚喀巴湾的权利，并且决心尽力防止以色列侵犯这种权利。他们还保证要尽可能支持“为独立和自由而斗争的阿尔及利亚人”。
    沙特国王是第一次作为国家元首访问伊拉克，这两国的王室之间一向有宿仇。最近以来，美国竭力促使这两个国家接近，企图在中东组织一个亲西方的阿拉伯集团，孤立埃及和叙利亚，以便在中东地区推行艾森豪威尔主义。参加巴格达条约的伊拉克被分派为这个计划的执行者。
    但是，据印度报业托辣斯报道：巴格达外交界人士认为，沙特在参加西方联盟的问题上同伊拉克国王费萨尔和首相赛义德并没有取得完全一致的意见。他们认为，沙特不愿意过分卷入西方联盟的表示，使约旦国王取消了他原定要参加这次巴格达会谈的计划。
    沙特阿拉伯—伊拉克会谈联合公报在叙利亚舆论中引起了不同的反应。官方没有发表任何评论，进步报纸发表社论表示反对，而被认为是保守的报纸只是刊载了这个公报避而不发表评论。
      “群众报”指出，伊拉克—沙特阿拉伯联合公报避而不谈积极中立主义，却表示要对所谓颠复性学说、犹太复国主义和帝国主义进行斗争。但是怎么能同意这种自相矛盾的说法呢？怎么能相信帝国主义的巴格达条约的一员伊拉克会同帝国主义作斗争呢？
      “巴拉达报”指出，阿拉伯各国已经以双边军事协定代替了阿拉伯国家集体防务公约，现在公报说要恢复后者，这对沙特阿拉伯来说等于废弃同埃及缔结的军事协定。
    约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊对沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克国王会谈后发表的联合公报表示欢迎。他说：这个公报是哈希姆和沙特两个王族关系中令人高兴的重大发展。据他说，这一发展，对所有阿拉伯国家有最大利益。
