Let's Openly Discuss Problems
New and Old Workers Eliminate Barriers

    This newspaper reports that when the workers of Xinxiang Printing Factory, were studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, they discussed the issue of disunity between new and old workers.

  In Xinxiang Printing Factory, the output of new workers is almost universally higher than that of old workers. As a result, some new workers look down on the old workers; while the old workers believe that the new workers are complacent, leading to disharmony. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the higher output of new workers is because the more complex tasks were assigned to the old workers, not allowing the new workers to do them; new workers did a better job in preparing tools and materials beforehand; new workers operated with more intensity and were more focused; however, they did not pay enough attention to quality. The old workers' output was lower because they paid special attention to quality when working, always checking and rechecking each piece, fearing poor quality; they were slower to accept new things, being accustomed to the old ways of operation; and they had more ideological baggage.

    The workers criticized the leadership for only seeing the advantages of the new workers, such as thinking that the new workers were enthusiastic in speaking at meetings and had high production morale, while not seeing the new workers' shortcomings in neglecting quality and not paying attention to strengthening education in this area, which created complacency among the new workers. Regarding the old workers, they were considered to be inactive in meetings, not paying attention to the way they made suggestions, and having low production morale, while their valuable qualities of paying attention to quality and speaking their minds were not seen, causing dissatisfaction among the old workers.

    Through discussion and analysis, everyone's understanding was improved a step further. The new workers faced up to their shortcomings, the old workers recognized their deficiencies, and the leadership examined their bureaucracy and subjectivism in their way of thinking. After the new and old workers corrected their attitudes, they used the method of "learning from each other's strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses" to learn from each other's advantages.

### 摆开问题大家谈  新老工人消除隔阂

    摆开问题大家谈
    新老工人消除隔阂
    本报讯　据河南日报报道，新乡印刷厂的工人们，在学习毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的讲话的时候，讨论了新、老工人之间的不团结问题。
  在新乡印刷厂，新工人的产量几乎普遍比老工人的高。因此，有些新工人就看不起老工人；老工人则认为新工人自满，彼此闹得不大团结。在讨论中大家一致认为，新工人的产量高是因为比较复杂的活都交给了老工人，没让新工人做；新工人在事先准备工具、材料方面做得较好；新工人操作紧张一些，思想较集中；但是对质量不够重视。老工人产量低是因为作活时特别注意质量，每作一件活，总是翻来复去地检查，恐怕质量不好；接受新事物较慢，习惯于老一套的操作方法；思想包袱较多。
    工人们批评领导上只看见新工人的优点，如认为新工人开会发言热烈，生产情绪高，而看不见新工人忽视质量的缺点，不注意加强这方面的教育，造成新工人的自满情绪。对于老工人，则认为他们开会不积极，提意见不注意方式，生产情绪不高，而对他们注意质量，有啥说啥这种高贵的品质却看不见，造成了老工人的不满。
    经过讨论分析，大家的认识提高了一步。新工人正视了自己的缺点，老工人认识了自己的不足，领导上检查了官僚主义和思想方法上的主观主义。新、老工人端正了态度后，用“取人之长，补己之短”的办法，互相学习了对方的优点。
