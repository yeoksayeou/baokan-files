The industrial construction of the past four years and more has greatly changed China's backward economic landscape, and the foundation for the socialist industrialization of the motherland has been initially laid. By the first quarter of this year, the capital construction investment in the industrial sector stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan was 25.4 billion yuan (the original stipulation of the Five-Year Plan was 24.85 billion yuan, and now this figure includes the investment of some newly established industrial sectors), of which about 20 billion yuan has been completed. It is expected that by the end of the year, it will be completed with an excess of 4.5%; about 750 projects above the limited quota have started construction (including non-industrial construction projects), which has exceeded the 694 target stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, it will reach more than 820, of which more than 450 will be completed. Among the increased 130-odd construction projects, the main ones are iron ore, coal mine, cement plant, and light industry enterprises that produce raw materials. The newly added production capacity of major industrial products during the five-year period can generally reach and exceed the requirements of the plan.

In the past four years and more, China's steel production capacity will increase by about one time. This year, the steel sector has also added six construction projects.

In the non-ferrous metal industry, which had a very weak foundation in China, after the newly built Fushun Aluminum Plant and other three factories and mines were put into production, the aluminum manufacturing industry has been established; the key projects under construction include the vanadium-titanium plant producing rare metals, the smelting plant smelting cemented carbide in large quantities, and tungsten mines.

Airplanes, automobiles, several types of large and precision machine tools, metallurgical equipment, mining machinery, power generation equipment, precision instruments, electron tubes, etc., which China could not produce at all in the past, can now be produced in batches. After the Fulaerji Heavy Machinery Plant, Luoyang Tractor Plant, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant and other factories under construction and renovation are completed, China's machine manufacturing industry will take a big step forward on the road of independent development.

Coal mining capacity will increase by nearly one time compared with 1952, and power generation equipment capacity will increase by more than one time. In the petroleum industry, in addition to renovating and expanding the existing enterprises in the past few years, a new oil refinery, the largest in China, has been built in Lanzhou, which can be put into production during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

A new chemical industrial zone is being formed in the Northeast. Here, the main workshops of China's largest calcium carbide plant and fertilizer plant have been completed and put into production. After the dye factory under construction is fully put into production, China will be able to produce high-grade dyes such as indanthrene and anan blue. In order to expand cement production capacity, two additional cement plants have started construction in Sichuan and Shaanxi this year.

During the five-year period, the investment in capital construction of heavy and light industries will change from 8:1 to 7.6:1. The number of construction projects above the limited quota of the Ministry of Textile Industry during the Five-Year Plan period has increased from 36 to 46. Among the added projects, there are Hangzhou Silk Printing and Dyeing United Factory, China's first modern joint factory in the silk industry, and Beijing Synthetic Fiber Intermediate Factory, China's first factory to produce nylon. The number of construction projects above the limited quota of the Ministry of Light Industry has doubled, and all of them are paper mills. The Jiamusi Paper Mill, China's newest type that can produce copper mesh and industrial paper in large quantities, was originally planned to be put into production during the Second Five-Year Plan period, but now it can be completed and put into operation in the second half of this year.

    落后的经济面貌大大改变  工业化的基础初步奠定
    本报讯  四年多来的工业建设大大改变了我国落后经济面貌，祖国社会主义工业化的基础已经初步奠定。到今年第一季度，第一个五年计划规定的工业部门基本建设投资二百五十四亿元（五年计划原规定是二百四十八点五亿元，现在这个数字包括了新成立的一些工业部门的投资），已经完成二百亿元左右，预计到年底将超额4.5％完成；开始施工的限额以上的建设项目已有七百五十个左右（包括非工业部门建设项目），已经超出五年计划规定的六百九十四个的指标，预计到年底将达到八百二十多个，其中竣工的将有四百五十多个。在增加的一百三十多个建设项目中，主要是一些生产原材料的铁矿、煤矿、水泥厂以及轻工业企业。五年期间主要工业产品新增加的生产能力，一般都可以达到和超过计划的要求。
    四年多来，我国钢铁的生产能力将增长一倍左右。今年，钢铁部门还追加了六个建设项目。
    在我国底子极薄的有色金属工业方面，新建的抚顺铝厂等三个厂矿投入生产以后，制铝工业已经建立起来；正在施工的重点工程还有生产稀有金属的钒钛厂，大量冶炼硬质合金的冶炼厂以及钨矿等。
    过去我国根本不能生产的飞机、汽车、若干种大型和精密的工作母机、冶金设备、矿山机械、发电设备、精密仪表、电子管等都已经能够成批生产了。等到正在建设和改建的富拉尔基重型机器厂、洛阳拖拉机厂、武汉重型机床厂等工厂建成之后，我国机器制造工业将在独立发展道路上迈进一大步。
    采煤能力要比1952年将近增加一倍，发电设备能力将增加一倍还多。在石油工业方面，几年来除了对原有的企业进行了改建、扩建外，还在兰州新建了一个我国最大的炼油厂，在第二个五年计划期间可以投入生产。
    一个新兴的化学工业区正在东北形成。这里，我国最大的电石厂和肥料厂的主要车间已经建成并投入生产，正在施工的染料厂全部投入生产以后，我国就将能生产出阴丹士林、安安蓝等高级染料。为了扩大水泥生产能力，两个追加的水泥厂今年已经分别在四川、陕西动工兴建。
    五年期间，重轻工业基本建设投资将由八比一变为七点六比一。纺织工业部五年计划期间限额以上建设项目由三十六个增加到了四十六个。在增加的项目里，有我国丝绸工业第一个近代化联合工厂——杭州丝绸印染联合厂，我国第一个生产尼龙的北京合成纤维中间厂等。轻工业部的限额以上建设项目增加了一倍，并且全部是造纸厂。我国最新型、能够大量生产铜网和工业用纸的佳木斯造纸厂，原计划在第二个五年计划期间投入生产，现在可以提前在今年下半年竣工。
