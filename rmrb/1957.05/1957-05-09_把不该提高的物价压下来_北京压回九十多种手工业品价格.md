　　Bring Down Unjustified Price Increases
　　Beijing Rolls Back Prices on Over Ninety Handicraft Items

　　Recently, the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Union conducted an inspection of price changes in handicraft products at the grassroots cooperative level and discovered that the price increases of certain handicraft items were not sufficiently reasonable. To protect the interests of consumers, the Union has successively rolled back the prices of over ninety products and has disciplined the heads of nine grassroots cooperatives who raised prices on their own.

　　Since the second half of last year, there have been some increases in the prices of handicraft products, mainly due to the rising prices of waste materials and agricultural and sideline products in the free market, which are used as raw materials for handicrafts. The price increases of handicraft products can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) Those that have been approved for price increases, such as dusters, brooms, wooden combs, straw baskets, and scrub brushes. (2) Those that have increased prices due to adjustments in profits between industry and commerce. In this case, the commercial sector raised the purchase price from the production cooperative, while the commercial retail price remained unchanged, thus having no impact on consumers. (3) Spontaneous price increases. There are quite a few products in this category, and the increases are relatively high, which has a greater impact on the lives of the masses.

　　Starting in the fourth quarter of last year, Beijing's handicraft products entered a "golden age," with almost all products becoming bestsellers. In addition, some cooperatives had a "rather more than less, rather up than down" mentality in their operations, one-sidedly pursuing profits, and thus blindly raised the sales prices of their products. For example, the Beijing Scissors Production Cooperative's Erjing rattan-handled electric light scissors originally sold for 68 fen per pair but were raised to 92 fen in November last year. The increase in raw material costs accounted for only 4.9 fen, while the remaining 19.1 fen was for increased wages and profits (they did indeed lose money in the past, but the increase this time was too large). These price increases were not approved by higher authorities and were neither reasonable nor legal.

　　In order to strengthen the price management of handicraft products, the Union has ordered its affiliated professional unions to conduct a strict review and handling of the issue of spontaneous price increases. It is stipulated that, in the near future, products with no profit due to rising raw material prices, or individual products that are losing money but the overall situation is profitable, should not be rushed to adjust prices, but should wait until the situation is clarified before making a decision. For products that are indeed losing money due to rising raw material prices and cannot be comprehensively profitable within the cooperative, they must be reported level by level and can only increase prices after approval. Price increase requests due to increased wages, welfare, and other expenses will generally not be approved. Welfare issues should be resolved by improving labor productivity and reducing costs.

　　Currently, the tense situation of handicraft products and raw materials in Beijing has eased, and prices have stabilized. Recently, the Beijing People's Committee has taken measures to roll back the prices of waste materials in the free market to their original levels. In the future, the prices of handicraft products can be stabilized.

### 把不该提高的物价压下来  北京压回九十多种手工业品价格

    把不该提高的物价压下来
    北京压回九十多种手工业品价格
    最近，北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社对基层社的手工业产品价格变动情况进行了检查，发现某些手工业品价格上涨的幅度不够合理。为保护消费者的利益，总社先后压回了九十多种产品的价格，并对自行提价的九个基层社的负责人进行了处分。
    去年下半年以来，手工业产品价格有了某些上涨，这主要是由于自由市场上的废料和农副产品等手工业原料涨价而引起的。手工业品涨价的情况大体上可分为三种：（一）经过批准涨价的。如毛掸、笤帚、木梳、草提篮、草根刷等日用杂品。（二）因工商业间调整利润而涨价的。这一类的品种是商业部门提高对生产社的收购价，商业本身销售牌价不动，因此对消费者无影响。（三）自发涨价。品种相当多，上涨的幅度也较高，对群众的生活影响比较大。
    去年四季度开始，北京市的手工业品进入了一个“黄金时代”，几乎所有的产品都成了畅销货，加上有些社在经营上有“宁多勿少，宁涨勿落”、片面追求利润的思想，因此盲目地提高产品销售价格。如北京剪刀生产社的二井藤把电光剪刀原售价每把六角八分，在去年11月上涨为九角二分；原料涨价部分只有四分九厘，其余一角九分一厘则为增加了工资费用和利润（过去确实赔钱，但这次增加的幅度过大）。这些产品的涨价并没有经过上级部门批准，既不合理也不合法。
    为了加强对手工业品物价管理，总社已责成所属各专业联社对自发涨价问题进行严格审查和处理。并规定，在最近期间，由于原料涨价产品无利，或个别品种赔钱总的有利的产品，不要急于调整价格，等情况弄清后再作决定；对由于原料涨价确实赔钱，社内不能综合利润的产品，必须逐级上报，经过批准才能涨价；对因增加工资、福利等费用，而要求涨价的，一般不予批准。福利问题应从提高劳动生产率降低成本来解决。
    目前北京市手工业产品和原料的紧张情况已趋缓和，价格也稳定下来。最近北京市人民委员会对自由市场的废料采取了压回原价的措施。今后手工业产品的价格是可以稳定的。
