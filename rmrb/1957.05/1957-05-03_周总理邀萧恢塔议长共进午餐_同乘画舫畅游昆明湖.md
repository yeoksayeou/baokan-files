Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Premier Zhou Enlai today invited Sao Hkun Hkio, Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities of Burma, and his family to a luncheon at the Tingliguan (Hall for Listening to Orioles) in the Summer Palace, and cruised Kunming Lake with the guests.

　　A gentle breeze swept across Kunming Lake. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Mr. and Mrs. Sao Hkun Hkio shared a decorated pleasure boat, enjoying the scenery of the lake and mountains. Numerous boats on the lake, upon spotting them, quickly rowed over, cheering, waving, and putting their palms together in salute. As they strolled along the lakeside and passed in front of Tingliguan, and as their pleasure boat passed through the Seventeen-Arch Bridge and approached the shore, tens of thousands of people surged from all directions, warmly applauding and cheering them.

　　On the boat, Premier Zhou Enlai told the guests that he missed Inle Lake in the Shan State of Burma very much. He had been a guest in Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio's villa on that beautiful lake. Zhou Enlai also asked Sao Hkun Hkio: "Have the fish species that China sent to Inle Lake been received?" Sao Hkun Hkio replied: "A portion has already been received."

　　The guests and hosts also spoke about the kinship between China and Burma. Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio said that visiting China was like being at home. Zhou Enlai invited them to visit once a year, like visiting relatives. Premier Zhou Enlai also said that he could teach Mrs. Sao Hkun Hkio how to cook Chinese food. He said he knew how to cook all kinds of fish.

　　Zhou Enlai then told the guests that the CCP Central Committee had recently issued a directive on the rectification campaign; our leaders had been studying how to participate in physical labor.

　　As a group of welcoming people cheered and crowded around the guests, Vice Premier He Long said to Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio: "They are here to welcome you." He then added that leaders should often be close to the masses, otherwise the masses would have opinions. Premier Zhou Enlai informed the guests: We are now opposing bureaucracy and breaking down the wall that separates us from the masses.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai asked Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio to convey his regards to President U Win Maung upon his return to Burma, and to send his greetings to Prime Minister U Nu and Deputy Prime Ministers U Ba Swe, Sao Hkun Hkio, U Kyaw Nyein, and Thakin Tin, and to invite Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe to come to China for convalescence after returning from medical treatment in the United States. Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio said that he would certainly convey the message and that he would report his trip to China to the Burmese people. (Attached picture)

    周总理邀萧恢塔议长共进午餐
    同乘画舫畅游昆明湖
    新华社2日讯  周恩来总理今天邀请缅甸民族院议长萧恢塔全家在颐和园听鹂馆共进午餐，并同客人畅游昆明湖。
    昆明湖上微风轻拂，周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和萧恢塔夫妇同乘画舫，共赏湖光山色。湖中无数只游船在发现了他们以后，都纷纷划拢过来，向他们欢呼、挥手和合十致敬。而当他们漫步湖堤和走过听鹂馆前的时候，当他们的画舫穿过十七孔桥和靠近堤岸的时候，更有成千上万的人从各处涌上前来，向他们热烈鼓掌欢呼。
    在舫上，周恩来总理对客人说，他非常怀念缅甸掸邦的英莱湖。就在那个美丽的湖中，他曾在萧恢塔议长的别墅里作过客。周恩来还问萧恢塔：“中国为英莱湖送去的鱼种收到了没有？”萧恢塔回道：“已经收到了一部分。”
    宾主还谈到了中国和缅甸的亲戚关系。萧恢塔议长说，在中国访问就像在自己家中一样。周恩来请他们像走亲戚一样，一年来一次。周恩来总理还表示，他可以教萧恢塔的夫人做中国菜。他说他会煮各种鱼。
    周恩来接着对客人说，中共中央最近发表了一个关于整风运动的指示；我们这些领导人曾研究过怎样去参加体力劳动。
    当一群欢迎的人向客人们欢呼拥来的时候，贺龙副总理对萧恢塔议长说：“他们是来欢迎你的。”随后他又说，领导人是要常常接近群众的，不然群众就会有意见。周恩来总理告知客人：我们现在正在反对官僚主义，要打破那堵隔离群众的墙。
    周恩来总理请萧恢塔议长回国后，向吴温貌总统致意，向吴努总理和吴巴瑞、藻昆卓、吴觉迎、德钦丁副总理问候，并请吴巴瑞副总理在美国治病回国后来中国休养。萧恢塔议长表示一定代为转致，他还表示他将向缅甸人民报告他的中国之行。（附图片）
