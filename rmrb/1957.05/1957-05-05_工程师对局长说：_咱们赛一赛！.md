Bureau Chief of the Construction Engineering Bureau, Peng Ju, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Construction Engineering Bureau, engineer Yu Fujing, and Director of the Construction Party Committee Propaganda Department, Liu Zhizhong, went to the Tianjin University construction site. Some of them had never done manual labor before, and some had done it in the past, but it had been more than ten years since they last did it. They all participated in the work of sifting soil. Everyone worked very enthusiastically. Peng Ju said to Yu Fujing, "Your skills are not as good as mine!" Yu Fujing disagreed and said, "Okay! Then let's have a race." As they spoke, the two of them started racing. The workers who were working with them were very moved. Worker Zhou Wenquan said, "I have been working for so many years, and in the past, I have never seen bureau chiefs and engineers personally come to the construction site to work, nor have I ever heard of it. Only the Communist Party can do this."

On this day, Zhang Ge, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Trade Union, and Chen Xiangxin, Dean of the Tianjin Urban Civil Architectural Design Institute, also went to the construction site to participate in labor. They went to the Second Construction Engineering Company's Second Engineering Area and poured concrete with the workers for half a day. Guo Jian, Deputy Secretary of the Construction Party Committee, participated in the flood control and dike construction project on the left bank of the Ziya River. (According to the Tianjin Daily)

    工程师对局长说：“咱们赛一赛！”
    建筑工程局局长彭举，建筑工程局副局长、工程师虞福京和建设党委宣传部长刘致中等，去的是天津大学工地。他们有的从来没有干过体力劳动，有的过去干过，到现在也已经十几年没有干了。他们都参加了筛土工作。大家干的挺带劲。彭举对虞福京说：“你那两下子还不如我呢！”虞福京不服气地说：“好吧！那咱们赛一赛。”说着，两人比赛起来。和他们一起干活的工人，很受感动。工人周文泉说：“我做了这些年工，过去从来没有看见过局长、工程师亲自到工地上来干活的，也从来没有听说过。只有共产党才能这样做。”
    这一天，到工地上参加劳动的还有天津市建筑工会主席张阁、天津城市民用建筑设计院院长陈向新等。他们到第二建筑工程公司二工区和工人一起浇筑了半天混凝土。建设党委副书记郭坚到子牙河左岸参加了防汛筑堤工程。　　　（据天津日报）
