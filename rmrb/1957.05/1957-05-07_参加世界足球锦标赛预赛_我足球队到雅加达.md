Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th: The Chinese football team arrived in Jakarta on the 5th, and they will play a preliminary match for the World Cup against the Indonesian national team on May 12th.

	The airport was particularly lively when the team arrived on the afternoon of the 5th. Fans crowded the waiting room and the outdoor square, vying to see the Chinese players' demeanor.

	Among those welcoming the team were Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, representatives from the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, and the chairman of the Chinese Overseas Association.

	After the Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Football Association, Kusashi, delivered a welcome speech, Huang Zhong, the leader of the Chinese football team, said in his speech that he believed the Chinese team's visit would allow them to learn valuable experience and techniques from the Indonesian football players, and he hoped that this competition would further enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. He said that the Indonesian football team's 0-0 draw with the Soviet team, who later won the championship, at the 16th Olympic Games had shocked the world.

	The news that the two football teams are about to hold a match has become a major topic of conversation here. Many newspapers have published introductions to the Chinese team and photos of the players. A stadium that can accommodate 65,000 people has been renovated.

    在欢迎的人群中还有中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇、印度尼西亚—中国友好协会代表和华侨总会主席等。
    在印度尼西亚足球总会副主席库萨希致欢迎词后，中国足球队领队黄中致词说，他相信中国队这次前来一定能向印度尼西亚足球队员们学到宝贵的经验和技术，他希望通过这次比赛能进一步增进两国人民的友谊。他说，印度尼西亚足球队在第十六届奥林匹克运动会上同后来获得冠军的苏联队比赛中，曾经获得零比零的成绩，这件事已经震惊了世界。
    两国足球队即将举行比赛的消息在这里已经成为街谈巷议的大事，许多报纸登载了中国队的介绍和队员照片。一个可以容纳六万五千人的球场已经改建好。各地许多人早就打电报和写信来订门票。
