Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 20th: Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure, who arrived in Guangzhou this afternoon, told reporters that he agreed with banning nuclear weapons testing and said that he was very interested in achieving peace and disarmament.

A reporter from Ta Kung Pao asked him about the views of French political circles on the embargo. He said, "There is now a trend to lift the embargo." He believes that this is determined by the overall international relations situation. He said that personally, he is inclined to a greatly relaxed approach.

Mr. Faure was accompanied by his wife. They are visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Faure also said that they plan to visit Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an during their nearly month-long stay in China, and also plan to go to Xinjiang to understand China's political, economic, and cultural development and the people's lives. He also expressed the hope that through this visit, he could understand the views of Chinese leaders on major world issues.
