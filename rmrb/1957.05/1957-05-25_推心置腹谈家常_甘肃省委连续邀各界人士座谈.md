Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 24th: Gansu Province, due to the leading cadres taking the lead and boldly promoting democracy, has seen a gratifying phenomenon of heart-to-heart talks and unreserved expression among non-Party members and the broad masses of intellectuals.

Since mid-April, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has successively held various meetings and symposia attended by people from various democratic parties, non-party democratic personages, intellectuals from all walks of life, and upper-level figures from ethnic and religious circles, extensively listening to criticisms and opinions from all sides. Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC, personally presided over these meetings, engaging in cordial conversations with the attendees in a casual manner. Other Party organizations at all levels also held such symposia, also presided over by the Party's First Secretary, extensively soliciting opinions from non-Party members. At the same time, the Gansu Provincial People's Committee and the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee respectively handled three incidents in which responsible Party cadres from the Gansu Provincial Cultural Bureau, the Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Committee, and the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation engaged in beating people and suppressing criticism due to complacency and privilege-seeking. This greatly dispelled the ideological concerns of non-Party members and some cadres within the Party regarding fear of retaliation and being targeted, creating an atmosphere in all aspects of daring to speak freely.

At various meetings and symposia, non-Party members boldly exposed various contradictions in their regions and departments, and criticized certain leading organs and responsible Party cadres. Many non-Party members believed in their speeches that some responsible Party cadres have a complacent and self-satisfied attitude, and act arbitrarily in their work; in some political power organs and administrative departments, Party activities are excessive, and the situation of the Party substituting for the government is serious; some non-Party members who hold administrative leadership positions still have titles without real power. They also proposed that members of democratic parties should be treated as masters, not as guests as in the past. They believe that only in this way can they speak their true feelings to each other, eliminate barriers, and better play the role of democratic parties in "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Some heads of local organizations of democratic parties, in addition to frankly speaking out at the meetings, also launched written discussions in local newspapers, each expressing their views on the principles and policies of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Shui Zi, Deputy Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, recently wrote an article for the newspaper, proposing to implement the principles and policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the sixteen characters of "division of labor and cooperation, doing a good job in unity, striving to reform, and seeking implementation."

At the industrial and transportation symposium held by the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC, many non-Party engineering and technical personnel sharply criticized the bureaucracy and sectarianism of the leading Party cadres in some capital construction departments. They criticized some responsible Party cadres for not consulting with technical personnel when deciding on relevant technical issues, and for being biased towards virtue rather than talent when using cadres. They believe that engineering and technical personnel have high salaries and poor ideologies, and they are not treated equally but are viewed differently. Engineering and technical personnel also criticized the phenomenon that certain capital construction departments cannot cooperate and collaborate with each other, lack unified planning, lack an overall concept, and "pass the buck" to each other, causing great waste of state wealth.

In universities and colleges such as Lanzhou University, Lanzhou Medical College, and Northwest Nationalities University, new and old teachers have changed the previous situation of only focusing on education and not paying much attention to politics, and discussed issues such as the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, leaders and those being led, young teachers and old teachers, and the school's system.

An unprecedented atmosphere of contention has also emerged in the cultural and artistic circles of Gansu Province. At the symposium of the cultural and artistic circles of the province, some literary and art workers criticized the Gansu Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles as "literary but not united," and many literary and art workers were still shut out of the Federation's doors. Some people criticized that many leading cadres in the cultural and artistic circles of Gansu Province are not familiar with the work and lack relevant knowledge of literature and art, and often use administrative orders to deal with cultural and artistic issues.

    推心置腹谈家常
    甘肃省委连续邀各界人士座谈
    新华社兰州24日电　甘肃省由于领导干部带头，放手发扬民主，目前在党外人士和广大知识分子中出现了推心置腹、畅所欲言的可喜现象。
    从4月中旬以来，中共甘肃省委连续召开了有各民主党派人士、无党派民主人士、各界知识分子以及民族、宗教界上层人士等参加的各种会议和座谈会，广泛听取了各方面的批评和意见。中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良亲自主持这些会议，用谈家常的方式同到会的人们亲切谈心。其他各级党组织也分别召开了这样的座谈会，也都由党的第一书记亲自主持，广泛地征求党外人士的意见。同时，甘肃省人民委员会和中共兰州市委员会还分别处理了甘肃省文化局、中共兰州市委财贸部、甘肃省交通厅三个党员负责干部由于居功骄傲和特权思想而发生的打人和压制批评的事件。这样就大大消除了党外人士和党内有些干部怕报复、怕挨整等思想顾虑，在各方面形成了敢于畅所欲言的空气。
    在各种会议和座谈会上，党外人士都大胆地揭露了本地区、本部门的各种矛盾，对某些领导机关和党员负责干部提出了批评。许多党外人士在发言中认为：有些党员负责干部有骄傲自满情绪，在工作中独断专行；在有些政权机关和行政部门，党的活动多，以党代政的情况严重存在；有些担任行政领导工作的党外人士仍然有职无权。他们还提出，要把民主党派成员当主人看待，而不要像过去那样把他们当客人看待。他们认为只有这样才能彼此说真心话，消除隔阂，更好地发挥民主党派在“长期共存、互相监督”中的作用。有些民主党派地方组织的负责人，除在会上坦率倾谈以外，还在当地报纸上展开笔谈，各抒自己对“长期共存、互相监督”，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的见解。民革甘肃省委员会副主任委员水梓最近给报纸写了文章，提出以“分工合作，搞好团结，努力改造，以求贯彻”十六个字来贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“长期共存、互相监督”的方针。
    在中共甘肃省委召开的工业交通座谈会上，许多非党工程技术人员对某些基本建设部门的党员领导干部存在的官僚主义和宗派主义提出尖锐批评。他们批评有些党员负责干部决定有关技术问题时不和技术人员商量，使用干部时有重德轻才的偏向。认为工程技术人员工资高、思想差，对他们不一视同仁，另眼看待。工程技术人员们还批评了某些基本建设部门不能互相配合和协作，缺乏统一计划，缺乏整体观念，互相“扯皮”，使国家财富造成很大浪费的现象。
    在兰州大学、兰州医学院和西北民族学院等高等学校里，新老教师们改变了以往只埋头教育不大过问政治的情况，对学校内部党与非党、领导与被领导、青年教师与老教师的关系中存在的问题以及学校的体制问题等进行了讨论。
    甘肃省的文化艺术界也出现了空前未有的争鸣气氛。在省文化艺术界座谈会上，有些文艺工作者批评甘肃省文联是“文而不联”，许多文艺工作者还被关在文联的大门以外。有人批评甘肃省文化艺术界很多领导干部都不熟悉业务，缺乏有关文艺方面的知识，往往用行政命令的手段来处理文化艺术问题。
