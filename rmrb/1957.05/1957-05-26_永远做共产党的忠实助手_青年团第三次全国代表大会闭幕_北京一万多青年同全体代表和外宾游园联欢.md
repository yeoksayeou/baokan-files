Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League concluded this afternoon.

At the meeting this afternoon, the "Resolution of the Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on the Work Report" was unanimously adopted. The resolution stated that the work report made by Hu Yaobang on behalf of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League, summarizing past work and proposing current tasks for the Youth League based on the new situation, is correct. The resolution pointed out that in the future, the work of the Chinese Communist Youth League should make greater contributions in the three areas of labor, learning, and unity under the close leadership of the Party, and work together with the youth and people of the whole country to complete the great historical mission of building a socialist society.

Hu Keshi, executive chairman of the congress, then delivered the closing speech. He said: "Our congress has been conducted under the cordial care and close guidance of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We fully support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions to our congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee, and we will take them as the general guideline for the future work of the Chinese Communist Youth League. We solemnly assure the Party that the Chinese Communist Youth League will always obey the leadership of the Party, always be the Party's loyal assistant, inherit and carry forward the Party's revolutionary tradition, and hold high the banner of communism to march towards the final victory." He said that after the closing of the congress, the task of our entire League is to unite and strive to implement the resolutions of the congress.

Hu Keshi expressed the hope that all cadres of the Youth League would consciously rectify their own thoughts and styles in the great practice of building socialism, strive to enhance their Marxist-Leninist cultivation, strive to participate in physical labor training, go deep into real life, go deep among workers and peasants, vigorously overcome the habits of superficiality and exaggeration, cultivate a humble and down-to-earth style, and better shoulder the responsibility of uniting and educating the younger generation.

Hu Keshi, on behalf of the congress, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the representatives of fraternal youth organizations from sixteen countries who attended the congress and gave their congratulations.

Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Tonight, over 10,000 young people from Beijing, representatives attending the Third National Congress of the Youth League, and young friends from sixteen countries held a get-together in Zhongshan Park.

Hu Yaobang, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, congratulated everyone at the get-together on winning the glorious title of Communist Youth League member on behalf of the Central Committee of the League. Subsequently, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe, which is about to go abroad to participate in the World Youth Festival, performed a program in the Music Hall.

Hu Yaobang and Wang Zhaohua, first secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, accompanied the Soviet Communist Youth League delegation to the front of Zhongshan Hall and joined the dance circle of Beijing Normal College. Hu Yaobang suggested that the young people sing "March of the Motherland" with their Soviet friends. With the arm of Hu Yaobang conducting, the majestic singing resounded in the sky above the joyful crowd.

The representatives of the Free German Youth League had just appeared in the Altar of Land and Grain and were surrounded by students from the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute. They were so familiar with each other that they talked enthusiastically in German. It turned out that these distinguished guests had visited the school yesterday and established friendship.

Everywhere there was joyful singing and dancing. Hu Keshi, a member of the Central Committee of the Youth League, held hands with a group of young students in the Altar of Land and Grain and sang the song "Ode to the Motherland" together. When the students of the Central Institute for Nationalities, who were dancing the youth dance, saw Yi ethnic representatives A Zhi Jia Jia and Hei Bie Wu Da coming, they immediately formed a circle, and applause rang out. A Zhi Jia Jia and Hei Bie Wu Da each sang a "Wedding Song" and a "National Unity Song".

In the dance circle, a group of students from the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration and the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel found the representatives from Urumqi, Xinjiang. They warmly inquired about the "Karamay" oil field and the steel mills in Xinjiang.

The youth representatives of the troops were especially welcomed by the students. Wherever they went, there was a burst of applause. In the dreamlike woods, they talked hand in hand and danced gently. It was late, and it was time to say goodbye. Everyone encouraged each other: We must advance together under the slogan of labor, unity, and learning.
