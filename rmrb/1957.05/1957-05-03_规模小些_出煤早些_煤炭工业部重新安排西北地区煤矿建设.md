    Smaller Scale, Earlier Coal Production
    Ministry of Coal Industry Reorganizes Coal Mine Construction in Northwest China

    (Reported by our newspaper) In order to implement the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, the Ministry of Coal Industry sent a work group headed by Vice Minister Zhong Ziyun to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces to inspect and summarize the experience and lessons learned from coal mine capital construction in the Northwest region during the First Five-Year Plan. They have reorganized the capital construction work for this year and initially determined the outline of coal industry construction in the Northwest during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    According to comrades in the work group, the achievements of coal mine capital construction in the Northwest in the past few years have been significant. The coal fields of Tongchuan in Shaanxi and Shandan in Gansu have been developed successively, and the Aganzhen mining area has been renovated. The construction scale in the Tongchuan area has exceeded more than ten times the original scale. At the same time, a large number of construction cadres have been trained. However, due to insufficient experience, many shortcomings and errors have also occurred. The main problem is that in the newly built mines, insufficient attention was paid to the characteristics of the coal seams and the economic effects, and there was blind pursuit of comprehensiveness and large scale. For example, the coal seams in the Tongchuan area are generally thin, and it is not suitable to build large mines, but the newly built mines are too large in type. Wangjiahe No. 1 Mine is built on a coal seam only 0.7 to 0.8 meters thick, and the designed capacity is 450,000 tons of coal per year. If the designed capacity is reached, the annual tunneling amount will reach more than 6,000 meters, which is equivalent to the tunneling amount of an ordinary 900,000-ton mine. Therefore, it has increased the investment in capital construction, and will also increase the difficulty of production and management after completion, and greatly increase production costs.

    Another shortcoming in the newly built mines is that more consideration was given to the needs of coal in the Northwest region, and not enough attention was paid to geological conditions. Especially in the Tongchuan area, where the coal seams are thin and extremely unstable, mines were built without first building a good underground production system. In order to save time, the ground buildings, railways, highways, and other projects were built first. As a result, after spending several million yuan in investment, it was discovered that there were no minable coal seams within 1,200 to 1,500 meters around the vertical shaft, and finally it had to be stopped.

    In the renovation of mines, there were also shortcomings of blindly seeking comprehensiveness and large scale, and the original equipment was not fully utilized. In fact, the renovation became new construction. For example, the Tongchuan No. 1 Mine was renovated from an annual output of 180,000 tons to an annual output of 300,000 tons, and 8.5 million yuan has been spent, but it has not yet been completed. The renovation projects of the Aganzhen and Shmengou adits have not utilized the original equipment either. The Aganzhen adit originally used one-ton mine cars, but it was changed to two-ton mine cars during the renovation. In fact, because there were no auxiliary locomotives and other equipment, it was very labor-intensive to use two-ton mine cars, and the roadways had to be widened during construction, which increased a lot of trouble for transportation management and prolonged the construction time. The renovation of these two adits has been going on for three years and has not yet been handed over to production. The construction standards for some non-productive projects are too high. For example, the people in the Tongchuan area originally had the habit of living in cave dwellings, but the coal mine capital construction department did not make use of cave dwellings, but built many buildings and brick houses.

    Based on past experience and lessons, the work group has reorganized the capital construction work in the future. First of all, according to the principle of spending less money and producing coal quickly, the mine construction plan of the Shizuishan coal field has been revised. This coal field has a total of nine minable coal seams. Originally, it was planned to build two pairs of vertical shafts with an annual output of 1.5 million tons each, with an investment of about 60 million yuan for each pair. It would take six years from construction to reaching the design requirements, and because there is no way to solve the problem of a large amount of power supply, large hoists, fans, and other equipment are also difficult to solve, and construction cannot begin in the next two years. Therefore, this cannot solve the problem of the urgent need for coal in the Gansu area. Now it has been decided to build three inclined shafts with an annual output of 300,000 tons and two inclined shafts with an annual output of 450,000 tons in the next few years, and first mine the upper coal. The construction of these five small inclined shafts requires a total investment of about 45 million yuan, and all the equipment can be solved domestically. Each mine will take a maximum of three years from the start of construction to reaching the design requirements. Construction of a mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons can begin this year. Because the coal seam here is very thick, two to three pairs of large vertical shafts can be built in the future according to production needs.

    The mines that have already started construction but were not designed reasonably in the past have also been modified according to geological conditions, and some equipment has been reduced. For example, because the coal seam of the Shandan Coal Mine is thin and water and electricity problems are not easy to solve, it has been decided to stop the modern production system and change the skips to cages, which is estimated to save at least 3 million yuan in investment. After it is put into production in the future, it can still produce coal according to the original design capacity. By reducing some unnecessary construction projects, not only is the use of funds more rational, but also a large amount of funds can be saved. The capital construction investment of Tongchuan Coal Mine alone has been reduced by more than 2 million yuan this year. They decided to use these investments to renovate two small kilns and build a new small kiln. These three small kilns can be completed in one or two years, and the output of coal can be increased by 400,000 tons per year. (Attached picture)

### 规模小些  出煤早些  煤炭工业部重新安排西北地区煤矿建设

    规模小些  出煤早些
    煤炭工业部重新安排西北地区煤矿建设
    本报讯  煤炭工业部为了贯彻勤俭建国的精神，派出以钟子云副部长为首的工作组，到陕西、甘肃两省检查和总结第一个五年计划期间西北地区煤炭基本建设的经验和教训，重新安排了今年的基本建设工作，并初步确定了第二个五年计划期间西北煤炭工业建设的轮廓。
    据工作组的同志谈，过去几年，西北煤矿基本建设工作的成绩是很大的，相继开发了陕西铜川和甘肃山丹的煤田，改建了阿干镇矿区，其中铜川地区的建设规模已经超过原来的十倍以上，同时，还培养了大批的建设干部。但是，由于经验不足，也发生了不少缺点和错误。其中主要的是在新建矿井中，不注意煤层的特点和经济效果，盲目求全求大。如铜川地区煤层一般较薄，不宜于建设大型矿井，而新建的矿井，井型都偏大。王家河一号矿井建在只有零点七至零点八公尺厚的煤层上，而设计能力是年产煤四十五万吨，如果达到设计能力，每年的掘进数量要达到六千公尺以上，相当于一个普通年产九十万吨矿井的掘进量。因此，就加大了基本建设投资，建成后也要给生产和管理增加困难，而且要大大增加生产成本。
    在新建矿井中的另一个缺点，就是从西北地区需要用煤方面考虑的多，而对地质条件注意不够，尤其是在铜川地区煤层薄、又极不稳定的地方建井，没有首先建好井下生产系统，为了赶时间就先把地面上的房屋、铁路、公路等工程建成了。结果，已经花了几百万元投资以后，才发现竖井周围一千二百至一千五百公尺以内的地方没有可采的煤层，最后只好停下来不建了。
    在改建矿井的工作中，也有盲目求全求大的缺点，没有充分利用原有的设备，实际上改建变成新建。如铜川一矿井由年产十八万吨改建成年产三十万吨，已经用掉八百五十万元，还没有建成。阿干镇和石门沟两个平峒的改建工程，也没有利用原有的设备。阿干镇平峒本来是使用一吨矿车，改建时又改成两吨矿车，实际上因为没有辅助机车等设备，使用两吨矿车就很费人力，而且在建设时又要加宽巷道，给运输管理增加了很多麻烦，也拖长了建设时间。这两个平峒改建已经三年了，还没有移交生产。一些非生产性的建设标准过高。如铜川地区人民本来有住窑洞的习惯，但煤矿基本建设部门却没有利用窑洞，而去盖了很多楼房和砖房。
    工作组根据过去的经验和教训，重新安排了今后的基本建设工作。首先根据少花钱、出煤快的原则，修改了石咀山煤田的建井计划。这个煤田可采煤层共有九层，原来准备建设两对年产一百五十万吨的竖井，每对投资约六千万元，从建设到达到设计要求需要六年时间，而且因为没有办法解决大量的供电问题，大型绞车、抽风机等设备也不好解决，在最近两年内不可能开工建设。因此，这就不能解决甘肃地区急需用煤的问题。现在决定在最近几年内，陆续建设三个年产三十万吨和两个年产四十五万吨的斜井，首先开采上层煤。修建这五个小型的斜井一共需要四千五百万元左右的投资，全部设备可以在国内解决，每个矿井从开工建设到达到设计要求，最多要三年时间。今年就可以开工建设一个年产三十万吨的矿井。因为这里煤层很厚，将来根据生产需要，还可以再建设两对至三对大型竖井。
    过去设计不够合理，而又已经开始建设的矿井，也根据地质情况修改了设计，削减了一些设备。如山丹煤矿因为煤层较薄，水、电等问题不易解决，就决定停止现代化的生产系统，将箕斗改成罐龙，估计最少可以节约三百万元的投资，而将来投入生产后，照样可以按照原来的设计能力生产煤炭。由于削减一些不必要的建设项目，不仅使资金使用得更加合理，而且可以节省出大量的资金。仅铜川煤矿今年的基本建设投资就削减了二百余万元。他们决定将这些投资改建两个小窑，新建一个小窑，这三个小窑在一、二年内就可以建成，每年可以增加四十万吨煤的产量。（附图片）
