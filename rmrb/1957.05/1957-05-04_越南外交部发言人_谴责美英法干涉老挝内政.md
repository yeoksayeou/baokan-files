Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 2nd: According to Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out yesterday that the notes presented by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to the Royal Government of Laos are blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos, a complete violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords, and are creating obstacles for the ongoing negotiations between the current Royal Government of Laos and the Lao Fighting Units to peacefully resolve Laos' political problems. The spokesperson said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam protests against this action by the American imperialists.

The Western three governments had sent a note to the Royal Government of Laos on April 16, in which they recklessly criticized the Lao Fighting Units in an attempt to obstruct an agreement between the two sides of Laos on the issue of unification.

The spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said that the Royal Government of Laos and the Lao Fighting Units have held negotiations and have achieved good results. However, these negotiations have displeased the Americans. They have been constantly undermining the peace and independence of Laos. The spokesperson also pointed out that "the United States Information Service, an official American agency, has repeatedly issued clichés saying that Laos is a 'dependency of the Viet Minh' and that there is a constant 'potential threat of armed intervention by the Viet Minh in Laos.' Everyone knows that these are baseless slanders aimed at hindering the healthy development of the friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos, which are welcomed by many leaders of the Royal Government of Laos."

    越南外交部发言人
    谴责美英法干涉老挝内政
    据新华社河内2日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人昨天指出，美国、英国和法国三国政府对老挝王国政府提出的照会显然是干涉老挝王国的内政，完全违反了1954年的日内瓦协定，并且为目前老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间为了和平解决老挝的政治问题而正在进行的谈判制造了障碍。发言人说，越南民主共和国政府抗议美帝国主义者的这种行动。
    西方三国政府曾经在4月16日照会老挝王国政府，在照会中滥肆抨击寮国战斗部队，企图阻挠老挝双方就统一问题达成协议。
    越南外交部发言人说，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队已经举行了谈判，并且获得了良好的结果。但是，这些谈判使美国人感到不高兴。他们一直不停地在破坏老挝的和平和独立。发言人并且指出，“美国的官方机构美国新闻处屡次发出陈腔滥调，说什么寮国是‘越盟的附属物’以及经常存在着‘越盟武装干涉老挝的潜在威胁’。谁都知道这些都是毫无根据的污蔑，目的是阻挠老挝王国政府的许多领袖所欢迎的越南民主共和国和老挝王国之间的友好关系的良好发展。”
