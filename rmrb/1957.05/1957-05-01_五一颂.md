    Ode to May Day
    Chen Shutong
    Labor creates the world, this principle is most evident,
    No one can deny it, hence the holiday is named.
    Speaking of history, its beauty is indeed the forerunner.
    In 1886, workers formed an alliance,
    Striving for the eight-hour system, one call received ten thousand responses.
    A general strike erupted, with solidarity like a city wall,
    The capitalists were suddenly shocked.
    Refusal proved ineffective, oppression became rampant,
    A bloody tragedy occurred on the streets of Chicago.
    Killings and arrests stirred public sentiment,
    Europeans also responded, starting with France and England.
    In 1889, the movement flourished even more,
    A congress was held in Paris, like an endless lamp,
    Illuminating the world, commemorating it eternally.
    May Day is celebrated year after year,
    The proletariat uses this to demonstrate its struggle.
    Today, Britain, France, and America go against their predecessors' course,
    Regarding this memorial day as a thorn in their side.
    Socialist countries uphold it as a model,
    Workers lead, production is increasing daily,
    Furthermore, uniting with farmers in cooperation and harmony,
    The economy can be independent, and living standards are trending towards balance.
    Our country establishes the constitution with this as the guiding principle.
    This year's May Day, the atmosphere is even more magnificent.
    Great, the Tiananmen Gate, the red flag shines with five stars,
    Distinguished guests have Mr. Fu Lao, a hundredfold increase in glory.
    Chairman Mao stands shoulder to shoulder, as loving as brothers,
    Cheers like thunder, joy overflowing.
    Tens of thousands of people in the square shouted to the heavens,
    "Long live peace! May humanity be forever peaceful!"
