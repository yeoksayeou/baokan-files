　　A Record of an Eight-Thousand-Li "Superficial Observation"
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng

    Li Xiuren, Deputy Director of the General Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, recently accompanied a central leading comrade on a work inspection tour of several regions. The trip lasted 57 days, covered more than 8,000 li, and inspected ten cities along the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways. Li Xiuren said that this was just a "superficial observation." The reporter asked him to talk about his observations and feelings regarding mass work in industrial and mining enterprises along the way. He spoke about some issues that are very worthy of deep thought.

    The "Crisis" of Trade Union Work
    Li Xiuren began by talking from north to south, from Baoding, the first city they arrived at, to Guangzhou, the last. He said that when they arrived at the Fengfeng Mining Area in Handan City, they happened upon more than 40 worker households and their families petitioning the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. The reason was that although the housing area for each employee was roughly the same, the rent varied greatly. Renting public housing cost a little over one yuan per month; renting private housing cost more than four yuan, with half subsidized by the public; while the houses that the trade union called on workers to build themselves with public assistance required a deduction of eight to ten yuan per month. Therefore, the workers who paid for their own houses had many complaints. Faced with this situation, the trade union not only did not help the workers to resolve the issue reasonably, but instead tried to persuade the workers, explaining the "correctness" of this unfairness. Therefore, the workers there said that the trade union and the administration were "speaking with one voice," and they set the trade union aside, organizing themselves to petition for a solution. The trade union became a nominal worker organization. Li Xiuren said that the common feature of the worker incidents he saw or heard about along the way was that the trade union was being set aside. This was because these trade union organizations did not care about or support the legitimate demands of the masses, and even defended the bureaucracy of the administration, defending some unreasonable resolutions and regulations. Therefore, some workers in Guangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Xinxiang, Shijiazhuang, and other places called the trade unions, which were originally supposed to represent their interests, the "worker management section" under administrative leadership, the "tongue of bureaucracy," and the "tail of the administration," etc. And when the contradictions between the workers and the administrative leaders became acute and were resolved by extreme methods, the workers set the trade union aside. The trade union lost the masses. Has the trade union not reached a "crisis" in its work when it is so divorced from the masses?

    Troubled Contradictions
    Li Xiuren talked about his conversations with trade union cadres in eleven cities. He said that most trade union cadres were not all indifferent or unresponsive to the legitimate demands of the workers. They wanted to support the legitimate demands of the workers, but sometimes they could not draw a clear line between right and wrong. They said that their work was a joy for all when the workers' opinions were consistent with those of the Party and government leaders, the Party was satisfied, the administration supported it, the workers were happy, and the trade union was glorious; when the workers' opinions conflicted with those of the Party and government leaders, the trade union cadres did not know how to properly handle the conflict. They said that they were Party members, and there were Party disciplines within the Party. They should obey the resolutions of the Party organization, otherwise they might be labeled with hats such as "syndicalism," "independence from the Party," or "tailism," and might even be expelled from the Party. On the other hand, they were elected by the workers and were representatives of the workers' interests, so they should obey the will of the majority of the workers, otherwise they would be said by the workers to be the "tail of the administration," etc., and would be abandoned by the workers. Faced with this contradiction, these cadres developed two faces: within the Party, they said that the various bureaucratic regulations were "incorrect" and should be corrected; the workers' various legitimate demands should be resolved. When their opinions were not adopted, in order to maintain the Party's unity of action, they told the masses outside the Party that those various bureaucratic regulations were "correct" and should be implemented; the workers' various legitimate demands could not be resolved; or they remained silent in front of the masses. As a result, right and wrong were not distinguished, and they pleased neither side. Many cadres in industrial and mining enterprises were troubled by this contradiction.

    Li Xiuren revealed to the reporter a very frustrating thing that happened to him along the way. He had wanted to collect examples of trade union cadres running around everywhere for the legitimate interests of the workers and getting "bloodied," in order to gain the support of the central leading comrades. As a result, he was very disappointed and gained nothing.

    Taking the "National Route" versus Taking the Mass Line
    Li Xiuren said that, as far as he saw and heard along the way, trade union cadres were still very concerned about the workers' housing and other issues. So he turned the topic to the forum of trade union chairmen from six factories that he convened in Zhengzhou. At the meeting, one said that the workers' family dormitories were not enough, another said that this was the biggest difficulty at present, and still another said that the factory was in the suburbs and it was too far to go to the city to see movies, so a movie theater should be built nearby for the factory's workers. In Shijiazhuang, Handan, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou, and other places, one could also hear calls for building dormitories, nurseries, kindergartens, children's schools, bathhouses, barber shops, roads, etc. These demands of the masses should be addressed and resolved as much as possible, but everyone was taking the "national route," all reaching out to the state for money, with a mentality of being granted favors. He said he had the impression that many people seemed to want to ask the state for everything from work to food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and even birth, old age, sickness, and death. Talking about this, the reporter jokingly interjected: "According to what you said, haven't some people entered communist society ahead of schedule? 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.'" Li Xiuren said half seriously: "It really has that kind of energy!"

    Li Xiuren said that he visited some factories in Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and other places, and outside the factories, one could see large areas of newly built red brick and tile houses. In Changsha and Zhengzhou and other places, the proportion of investment in building dormitories in some factories' construction investment was already very large, and many workers also demanded family dormitories and requested that their families be brought to the city. If all these requirements were met, the urban public utilities and service industries would have to increase a large amount of investment and increase a large number of employees. These employees would then want family dormitories..., and as a result, the situation of building houses and lacking houses would inevitably develop like a snowball, building more and more, and lacking more and more. Regarding this issue, he heard a new and correct solution this time, that is, the workers' living and child-rearing needs should mainly follow the mass line and organize employees to solve it themselves. This is possible. He said that the workers in the factory in the suburbs of Zhengzhou who demanded to build a movie theater near their factory spent one or two yuan each time they accompanied their loved ones or children to see a movie because it was far away to see movies. This factory has about 6,000 workers, and there are several other factories nearby. If the trade union organizes employees from several factories to raise funds and use voluntary labor to build a simple movie theater, it can be done. Barber shops, bathhouses, nurseries, children's schools, etc., can also be solved in the same way. Isn't the school that Comrade Liu Shaoqi organized workers to run themselves in Anyuan Coal Mine in the past still very good today?

    Which Rank of Cadre to Be
    In Guangzhou, Li Xiuren heard from the chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and some trade union cadres in factories and mines that some trade union cadres in Guangdong Province believed that trade union cadres were fourth-class cadres. Their classification was: Party first, government second, engineer third, and fourth was the trade union. This phenomenon of self-deprecation was also occasionally heard in other cities. Some trade union cadres were even more frustrated, thinking that they were not even worthy of being fourth-class, not even as good as the workshop director. The section chief was the head of a section and was also very impressive; management personnel could also shout and scold, and the power to distribute houses was in their hands, and people had to live the way they were assigned. However, trade union cadres could not get things done, their words did not carry weight, and they were not allowed to go on stage to make reports at large meetings. Living in good houses or riding in cars was often only the privilege of the first three classes of cadres. Li Xiuren said that these remarks he heard were actually all comparing rights and living standards with those above. On the contrary, he did not hear people comparing work with others, nor did he hear people comparing work and living with the workers. When talking about this issue in Guangzhou, someone put forward a brilliant insight. Someone said that trade union cadres should best be "equal" to the workers, or be cadres without a "rank," representing those who were "outside the ranks." Trade union cadres should also have "four togethers" or several togethers, such as eating together, living together, playing together, and laboring together. In this way, mass work can be carried out actively and will not become detached from the masses.

    Li Xiuren said that in the winter of last year, Guangzhou Inner Port implemented the so-called "mobile shift change," that is, a disguised overtime system of concentrated work and concentrated rest. Each worker worked eight hours, rested eight hours, and then worked eight hours, working sixteen hours a day and resting one day after two days. The porters were carrying things weighing more than 100 kilograms. After working eight hours, they were already very tired. In the eight hours of rest, after deducting the time for walking back and forth and eating, there was very little time left. Soon after closing their eyes, it was time to go to work again. Therefore, many people became ill from exhaustion. Those who were not ill, because their hands and feet were weak, carried very little, so the wages they received (piecework) were not as much as they received for taking sick leave (75% of the basic wage). As a result, those who were not sick also pretended to be sick, slowed down, and took sick leave. Sixty percent of the people did not go to work. The trade union cadres not only did not oppose this wrong decision of the administration, but also helped the administration to find ways to prevent doctors from issuing sick leave certificates to workers, forcing workers to go to work. The two vice-chairmen of the port trade union were originally porters in the port. They became cadres "within the rank" and forgot the suffering of the workers. Li Xiuren said that if these two trade union cadres had not left production, they would definitely have found that their bodies were not made of iron, and they would definitely have stood up with the workers to oppose this wrong decision of the administration.

    "Persuasion is Omnipotent" and Other Things
    Li Xiuren said that, as far as he saw along the way, the trade union paid great attention to building clubs, libraries, film teams, and amateur troupes, and had made great achievements. However, there was very little research on the political and ideological trends of the workers. This time, it was found that some workers were developing a kind of utilitarianism, picking and choosing jobs, and doing whatever paid high wages. Some technicians had no work to do, and they felt ashamed if they were asked to carry soil or sweep the floor with a broom. He also talked about some other ideological conditions of the workers. He said that these situations had not attracted the attention of all trade unions and relevant parties; some had paid attention, but the solution was dogmatic. A comrade from a factory in Zhengzhou said that when solving the current ideological problems of the workers, they were strengthening education. The method of strengthening education was to compile teaching materials and talk about "monkeys becoming humans," the glory of labor, the communist vision, and the history of the Chinese workers' movement. These educations are generally said to be necessary, but they are only applicable to a small number of people in the factory. If you want to use these teaching materials to solve all the current specific ideological problems of all employees, it is a bit aimless. The political education of workers should be aimed at the current ideological situation and solve the current ideological problems.

    Speaking of ideological education, factories in Zhengzhou and other places have a headache about the ruffians who have mixed into the workers' ranks. These people steal, slow down, and disrupt the order of life. They have been repeatedly educated without change. So some people advocate expulsion, while others believe that they should still be persuaded. Li Xiuren said that he very much agreed with this view, that is, those who have been repeatedly educated without change should be resolutely expelled, and persuasion is not omnipotent. They can be helped to find employment when they change their minds.

    Li Xiuren said at the end of his two-and-a-half-hour conversation that he believed that the shortcomings of grassroots trade union work were related to the leadership of the entire trade union.

    When the reporter said goodbye to him, he said that the "sight" of the "superficial observation" was inevitably not deep; since it was what he "heard," there might be mishearings and misrepresentations.

    八千里“走马观花”记
  　新华社记者　李峰
    全国总工会办公室副主任李修仁不久前曾随同中央一位负责同志到一些地区检查工作，历时五十七天，行程八千多里，视察了京汉和粤汉铁路沿线十个城市。李修仁说，这只是“走马观花”。记者请他谈谈沿途有关工矿企业群众工作的见闻和观感。他谈到了一些很值得人们深思再深思的问题。
    工会工作的“危机”
    李修仁开始从北往南谈，从他们到达的第一个城市保定说到最后一个城市广州。他说，他们到达邯郸市峰峰矿区时，正碰上四十多户工人及其家属到峰峰矿务局请愿。原因是那里每户职工住的房子面积虽然相差不多，但是房租相差很大。住公家的房子，每月是一元多；租民房住是四元多，由公家补贴一半；而工会号召工人自建公助的房子，每月要扣八元到十元。因此，那些自己出钱盖房子的工人意见纷纷。工会面对这种情况，不但不帮助工人合理地解决，却去努力说服工人，解释这种不公的“正确性”。因此，那里的工人说工会和行政上是“一个鼻孔出气”，而把工会撇到一边，自己组织起来去请愿解决。工会成了一个工人组织的虚名。李修仁说，他沿途见到或听到的工人闹事事件，一个共同的特点是把工会撇在一边。因为这些工会组织不关心或不支持群众的正当要求，甚至为行政方面的官僚主义辩解，为一些不合理的决议和规定等辩护。所以广州、长沙、武汉、新乡、石家庄等地的一些工人，把本来是代表自己利益的工会，叫作行政领导下的“工人管理科”，“官僚主义的舌头”，“行政的尾巴”等等。而当工人和行政领导方面的矛盾尖锐化以致用偏激的方法解决时，工人就把工会撇到一边去。工会失去了群众。工会脱离群众到这种程度，不是工会工作的“危机”吗？
    苦恼的矛盾
    李修仁谈到了他和十一个城市的工会干部交谈的情况。他说，多数工会干部对工人的正当要求并不都是熟视无睹、无动于衷的，他们想支持工人的正当要求，但有时划不清是非界限。他们说，他们的工作，在工人群众同党政领导方面意见一致时，党满意，行政支持，工人高兴，工会也光彩，大家皆大欢喜；在工人同党政领导方面的意见发生矛盾时，工会干部就不知如何正确地处理这种矛盾。他们说，他们是党员，党内有党纪，应该服从党组织的决议，否则就可能给顶“工团主义”、“对党闹独立”或“尾巴主义”之类的帽子戴戴，甚至可能被开除党籍。另一方面，他们是工人选举的，是工人利益的代表者，应该服从多数工人的意志，否则就又被工人说是“行政的尾巴”等等，就被工人抛开。在这种矛盾面前，这类干部就产生了两个面孔：在党内，他们说官僚主义种种规定是“不正确的”，应纠正；工人的这种或那种正当要求应解决。自己的意见不被采纳时，为了保持党的行动一致，他们在党外又对群众说，那些官僚主义的种种规定是“正确的”，应该执行；工人的这种或那种正当要求不能解决；他们或者在群众面前缄默不语。结果是非不分，两头不讨好。很多工矿企业的干部都苦恼在这种矛盾之中。
    李修仁向记者透露了沿途他自己一件很不顺心的事。他本想沿途搜集一些工会干部为工人正当的利益四处奔走而碰得“头破血流”的事例，以便取得中央负责同志的支持。结果他很失望，一无所获。
    走“国家路线”和走群众路线
    李修仁说，就他沿途所见所闻，工会干部对工人群众的住宿等方面的问题倒还很关切。于是他把话题转到了他在郑州召开的六个厂的工会主席座谈会。会上，这个说工人家属宿舍不够住，那个也说这是当前最大的困难，还有的说，工厂在郊区，到市区看电影太远，应该在近处为本厂工人修建电影院。在石家庄、邯郸、汉口、长沙和广州等地，也可听到要求修建宿舍、托儿所、幼儿园、子弟学校、澡堂、理发室、马路等等的呼声。群众这些方面的要求，应该关心，应该尽量设法解决，但大家走的都是“国家路线”，都伸手向国家要钱，思想上有一种恩赐观点。他说他有这样一种印象，许多人好像是从工作到衣食住行，甚至生老病死，缺什么就想向国家要。谈到这里，记者当作笑话插问道：“照你说的情形，有些人不是提前进入了共产主义社会了吗？‘各取所需’。”李修仁半认真地说：“真有那么点劲头！”
    李修仁说，他在石家庄、郑州等地参观了一些工厂，厂外都可以看到新建的大片大片的红楼瓦舍，长沙和郑州等地，有些工厂建设宿舍的投资占建厂投资的比重已很大，还有很多工人要求家属宿舍，要求把家属接到城市来。如果都满足这些要求，城市公用事业和服务性行业又要增加大量投资，又要增加大量的职工。这些职工又要家属宿舍……，结果建房子和缺房子的情况势必成为滚雪球式的发展起来，愈建愈多，愈建愈缺。关于这个问题，他这次听到一个新的正确的解决办法，就是工人生活和工人养育子女的种种要求，应该主要是走群众路线，组织职工自己解决。这是可能的。他说，郑州郊区那个要求在本厂附近修建电影院的工厂的工人，因为看电影路远，每次伴同自己的爱人或孩子看一次电影要花一两块钱。这个厂有六千左右的工人，附近还有几个工厂，如果工会组织几个厂的职工集资和用义务劳动的办法修建一个简单的电影院，是可以办到的。理发室、澡堂、托儿所、子弟学校等，也同样可以应用这种办法解决。刘少奇同志过去在安源煤矿组织工人自办的学校至今还不是很好吗？
    当哪一等干部
    在广州，李修仁听市工会联合会主席和一些厂矿的工会干部说，广东省有的工会干部认为工会干部是四等干部。他们的分法是：党第一，政第二，工程师第三，第四才是工会。这种自我菲薄的现象在其它城市里也时有传闻。有的工会干部更懊丧，认为自己连四等也够不上，连车间主任也不如。工段长是一段之长，也很神气；管理人员也可以呼呼喝喝的，分房子大权在手，怎么分人们就得怎么住。而工会干部就吃不开，说话不顶事，开大会不让上台作报告。住好房子或坐汽车，也往往只是前三等干部有份。李修仁说，他听到的这些议论，实际上都是向上面比权利、比生活待遇。相反地，他没有听到人们同别人比工作，没有听到人们同工人群众比工作、比生活。在广州谈到这个问题时，有人提出了一种精辟的见解。有人说，工会干部最好和工人群众一“等”，或当个没“等”的干部，代表那些“等”外人。工会干部最好也来个“四同”或几同，如同吃、同住、同玩、同劳动等。这样，群众工作才能作活，才不致脱离群众。
    李修仁说，广州内港去年冬季实行所谓“机动换班”，即集中工作集中休息的变相加班制，每个工人干八小时，休息八小时，再干八小时，一天干十六小时，两天以后休息一天。搬运工搬的都是一百多公斤重的东西，干八小时已很疲劳，八小时的休息时间中，除去来回走路和吃饭，剩的时间很少，闭上眼不久又到了上班时间。因此，很多人累病了，未累病的工人，因手脚无力，搬得很少，所以拿到的工资（计件）还没有请病假拿到的多（基本工资的75％）。这样，那些不病的人也装病、怠工、请病假，60％的人不上班了。工会干部对行政方面这种错误的决定，不仅不反对，而且还帮助行政方面想办法，使医生不给工人开病假证明，迫使工人上工。这个港工会的两个副主席原来就是本港搬运工人，他们成了“等”内干部，就忘掉了工人的疾苦。李修仁说，如果这两个工会干部不脱产，他们一定会发现自己的身体不是铁打的，一定会和工人一起，挺身反对行政方面这种错误的决定。
    “说服万能”及其它
    李修仁说，沿途所见，工会对于建设俱乐部、图书馆、电影队和业余剧团很注意，有很大成绩。而对于工人的政治思想动态研究很少。这次发现有些工人滋长一种功利主义，作工挑肥拣瘦，什么工资高干什么。有的技工没活干，让他担担土拿把扫帚扫扫地就感到丢脸。他还谈到了工人中其它的一些思想状况。他说，这些情况并没有引起所有工会及有关方面的注意；有的注意了，但解决的方法是教条主义的。郑州一个工厂的同志谈到解决工人当前的思想问题时说，他们正在加强教育。加强教育的方法是编教材，讲“猴子变人”、劳动光荣、共产主义远景、中国工人运动史。这些教育，一般说是需要的，但只适用工厂内的少数人，如果想用这些教材解决所有职工当前的一切具体思想问题，那就有点无的放矢了。工人的政治教育，应当针对当前的思想状况，解决当前的思想问题。
    提到思想教育，郑州等地的工厂对混进工人队伍的流氓很头痛。这些人偷盗、怠工、扰乱生活秩序，屡教不改，于是有人主张开除，有人认为还是应该说服。李修仁说，他很赞成这种意见，即屡教不改者坚决开除，说服并不是万能的。可以等这些人回心转意时，再帮助他们就业。
    李修仁在结束他的两个半小时的谈话时说，他认为基层工会工作的缺点同整个工会的领导有关。
    记者向他告辞时，他说，“走马观花”式的所“见”，就难免不深；既是所“闻”，就可能有误听错传。
