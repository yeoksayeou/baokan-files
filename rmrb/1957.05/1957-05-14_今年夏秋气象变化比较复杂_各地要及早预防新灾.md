Xinhua News Agency, 13th - The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a notice today, requiring all regions to prevent possible new disasters as early as possible.

The notice stated: According to the forecast of the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, the weather changes will be relatively complex from May to September this year. Rainfall in some areas may exceed the average rainfall for the same period in previous years; typhoons may also make landfall between July and September. The arrival time of floods may also be earlier. However, rainfall in some other areas may not reach the average rainfall for the same period in previous years, and there is a possibility of drought. Although these predictions are not necessarily entirely accurate, they should not be ignored. Therefore, all regions must do a good job in preventing and rescuing from new disasters.

The notice requires all regions to first educate cadres and the masses to overcome complacency. In particular, areas that suffered disasters last year, where the vitality of the masses has been somewhat depleted, should pay special attention to preventing new disasters. The blindly optimistic idea that "last year was a year of severe disaster, and there will be no more major disasters this year" is unfounded and must be corrected. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent certain panic that may arise among cadres and the masses after weather forecasts, which may affect confidence in striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

Secondly, in areas that suffered disasters last year, relying on agricultural producers' cooperatives to prevent disasters and carry out rescue work achieved good results, proving that the ability to prevent and rescue from disasters has been greatly enhanced after collectivization. However, in some areas, preparations before the disaster were too late, and the rescue work was not well organized, resulting in considerable losses. The experiences and lessons of last year should be summarized as a reference for this year's work.

Preparations for disaster prevention this year should be comprehensively checked as early as possible. Disaster prevention projects that need to be added should be built as early as possible; projects that have been completed but are not strong enough should be repaired as soon as possible. Disaster prevention and rescue equipment, materials, and replanting seeds should also be prepared early. In particular, the leadership and organization of manpower in various regions for this work should be checked. In times of disaster, cadres must be urged to go deep into the grassroots, divide areas, assign responsibilities, and work with the masses to fight against disasters and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

The notice also pointed out that in disaster prevention and rescue work, socialist education and collectivist education must be strengthened among the masses to prevent the phenomenon of only caring about one's own property and disregarding public property, so as to quickly overcome natural disasters.

In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen education on thrift among the masses. Especially after the summer harvest, it is necessary to widely promote saving and storage to enhance the strength to prevent new disasters and overcome famine.

### 今年夏秋气象变化比较复杂  各地要及早预防新灾

    今年夏秋气象变化比较复杂
    各地要及早预防新灾
    新华社13日讯　内务部在今天发出通知，要求各地及早预防可能发生的新灾。
    通知说：据中央气象科学研究所预报：今年5至9月间，气象变化比较复杂，有些地区雨量可能超过历年同期雨量；7至9月间，并可能有台风登陆。洪水到来的时间也有可能提早。另有一些地区雨量却达不到历年同期雨量，有发生干旱的可能。这些预测虽然不一定十分准确，但不可忽视。因此，各地必须做好新灾的防御和抢救工作。
    通知要求各地：首先要教育干部和群众克服麻痹思想。特别是去年已遭灾害的地区，群众元气有所亏损，尤应注意防御新灾。那种认为：“去年是个重灾年，今年就不会再有特大灾害”的盲目乐观思想，是没有根据的，必须加以纠正。同时，也要防止气象预报以后在干部和群众中可能产生的某些恐慌情绪，影响到争取农业丰收的信心。
    其次，去年有灾地区，依靠农业生产合作社预防灾害和进行抢救工作，成绩很好，证明合作化以后防灾和抢救的能力都大大增强了。但也有一些地区，灾前准备过迟，抢救工作组织得也不够好，吃了不少亏。应当对去年的经验和教训加以总结，以作今年工作的借鉴。
    对今年防灾的准备工作，要及早进行全面的检查。需要增添的防灾工程，要及早修建；已成的工程不够坚实的，要尽早修补。防灾和抢救的器材、物资以及补种种籽等，也要早点准备；特别要检查各地对这一工作的领导和对人力的组织情况，在灾情紧张时，必须督促干部深入下层，划片包干，分工负责，和群众一起，同灾害作斗争，争取今年大丰收。
    通知还指出：在防灾和抢救工作中，必须加强对群众的社会主义教育和集体主义教育，防止发生只顾自己的财产，不顾公共财产的现象，以便迅速的战胜自然灾害。
    另外，还要加强对群众的节约教育。尤其在夏收以后，要广泛提倡节约储蓄，增强预防新灾和度荒的力量。
