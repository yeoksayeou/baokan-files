Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd: General Su Yu, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report on the 20th to over seven thousand representatives of officers, staff, students, and soldiers of the armed forces in the Chongqing area.

After analyzing the international and domestic situation, General Su Yu focused on the relationship between the armed forces and local governments and the people, as well as the internal contradictions and rectification within the armed forces. He said that the relationship between the armed forces and local governments and the people is generally normal. However, due to shortcomings in the ideology and work style of some military leading cadres, some contradictions have been artificially created. For example, some military garrisons occupy too much land, and the housing is too spacious and good; some units overemphasize secrecy, demarcating excessively large restricted areas. This has caused considerable difficulties for local governments in allocating and using land and housing, and has also caused much waste of land and housing, arousing dissatisfaction among the people. These situations need to be rectified, and excessive land and housing should be handed over to the local authorities, and the excessively large restricted areas should be reduced or eliminated. In addition, the special treatment of certain material living conditions in the armed forces, which are not sufficiently arduous and simple, also alienates them from the masses to a certain extent, affecting internal unity. For example, some military garrisons have "officers' homes" and "senior cadre clubs," which should be abolished. The "officers' homes" should become homes for all military personnel.

Speaking of internal contradictions in the armed forces, General Su Yu pointed out that due to the rather serious subjective, bureaucratic, and sectarian work styles of some leading cadres in the armed forces, some contradictions have arisen between officers and soldiers, between senior intellectuals and administrative cadres, between new and old cadres, between comrades with and without military status, and between intellectuals and worker-peasant cadres. For example, administrative cadres have not provided senior intellectuals with convenient conditions for scientific and technological research, and have even been too hasty in their demands on their research work, thinking that it would be successful as soon as it is put into the pot like cooking rice. This shows the subjectivism and sectarianism of the administrative leaders. At present, some cadres in the armed forces are gradually developing some undesirable ideological tendencies. For example, the concept of fame and status is gradually rising, and some people are calculating the level of military ranks and worrying about personal treatment; some people have shown the style of young masters, like to show off, like to live in tall buildings, and are unwilling to live in wooden or thatched houses. Office rooms and dormitories should be spacious and comfortable. These ideological and work styles are completely incompatible with the arduous and simple traditions of the People's Liberation Army.

General Su Yu said that in view of these circumstances, our troops must carry out rectification well. He hoped that Party and government cadres and non-Party intellectuals in various places would boldly expose the erroneous ideological and work styles existing in the armed forces. In particular, leading cadres in the armed forces should seriously examine themselves in the rectification, and actively and courageously admit and examine their mistakes and shortcomings. Only in this way can we strengthen the internal unity of the armed forces and enhance the prestige of the leading cadres.

General Su Yu also talked about the reorganization and demobilization of the armed forces. He said that it is impossible for the state to allocate more funds to support a large army while carrying out large-scale economic construction. As wars become increasingly modernized, it is difficult for some people who are older and have poor education to continue to shoulder the responsibility of combat command. A large number of young people with cultural knowledge who can quickly master new technologies are needed to replenish the sources of soldiers. Conscious young soldiers who have undergone military training should also be demobilized to participate in industrial and agricultural production to accumulate combat reserve forces. Therefore, the existing troops must be reorganized, and a group of soldiers must be demobilized to participate in agricultural production and industrial construction to accelerate the speed of national socialist construction and reduce military expenditures. After reorganization and demobilization, the armed forces will be able to allocate more funds from the existing military expenditures to strengthen the country's economic construction and modern national defense construction.

    粟裕总参谋长谈部队整风
    希望各地党政干部大胆揭露部队中的错误思想作风
    新华社重庆22日电　中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕大将，20日向重庆地区部队的军官、职员、学员和士兵代表七千多人作了报告。
    粟裕大将在分析国际和国内形势后，着重谈到了部队同地方政府和人民群众的关系，以及部队内部矛盾和整风问题。他说，部队同地方政府的关系、同人民群众的关系，基本上是正常的。但是因为某些军队领导干部思想作风有缺点，人为地造成了一些矛盾。如有些部队驻地占的面积太多，居住房舍过宽过好；有些部队过分强调保密，将禁区划得过大。这样，给地方政府在分配使用土地、房屋上造成不少困难，也造成土地、房屋的许多浪费，引起人民群众不满。这些情况都需要切实纠正，应当把过多的土地、房屋交给地方，把过大的禁区范围加以缩小或取消。另外，部队某些物质生活待遇特殊化，不够艰苦朴素，也在一定程度上脱离群众，影响部队内部的团结。如有些部队驻地都有“军官之家”、“高级干部俱乐部”，这些都应当取消。“军官之家”应当变成军人之家。
    在谈到部队内部矛盾时，粟裕大将指出，由于某些部队领导干部存在着相当严重的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义作风，造成了官兵之间，高级知识分子和行政干部之间，新老干部之间，有军籍的和无军籍的同志之间，以及知识分子和工农干部之间的一些矛盾。如行政干部没有很好给高级知识分子创造科学技术研究的便利条件，甚至对他们的研究工作要求过急，以为像煮大米饭一样，一下锅就成功，这些都表现了行政领导干部的主观主义和宗派主义。目前有一部分部队干部还逐渐滋长了一些不良的思想倾向。例如：名誉地位观念逐渐抬头，有些人斤斤计较军衔级别的高低，闹个人的待遇；有些人表现了大少爷的作风，好讲排场，喜欢住高楼大厦，不愿意住木房草房，办公房和宿舍要讲究住得宽大舒适等。这些思想作风都和人民解放军艰苦朴素的传统作风完全不相容的。
    粟裕大将说，鉴于这些情况，我们部队必须要很好地进行整风。希望各地党政干部和党外知识分子，大胆地揭露部队里存在的错误思想作风。部队领导干部尤其要在整风中认真地检查自己，主动地、勇敢地承认和检查自己的错误和缺点，只有这样，才能加强部队内部的团结，也才能提高领导干部的威信。
    粟裕大将还谈到了部队的整编和复员问题。他说，国家进行大规模经济建设，不可能抽出更多经费来供养大量军队。随着战争愈来愈近代化，原来一些年龄大了和文化程度太差的人就很难继续担负起战斗的指挥责任，需要大批有文化知识能很快掌握新技术的新血液——青年人来补充兵源。经过军事训练的有觉悟的青年军人，也要复员参加工农业生产，以蓄积战斗后备力量。因此，现有部队必须整编，复员一批军人参加农业生产和工业建设，以加快国家社会主义建设的速度，而减少军费开支。部队经过整编和复员，就能在现有军费中，抽出更多的经费来加强国家的经济建设和现代化的国防建设。
