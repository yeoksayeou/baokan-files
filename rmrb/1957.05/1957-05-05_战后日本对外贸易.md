    Post-War Japanese Foreign Trade
    Lan Hai
    In the past two or three years, Japan's foreign trade has significantly expanded. From 1953 to 1955, the total global trade output increased by an average of 4% annually, but Japan's exports increased by an average of 16% annually during the same period. In particular, the growth rates for the previous year and last year were 23% and 25%, respectively, higher than any major capitalist country in the world. Japan's export volume ranked fifth in the world before the war, dropped to seventeenth in 1950, but rose to eighth in 1955. Now, on the stage where imperialist countries are fiercely competing for markets, Japan has reappeared. Last year, Japan's foreign trade amounted to 2.5 billion US dollars in exports and 3.2 billion US dollars in imports, both of which have largely returned to pre-war levels. However, in terms of trade structure and nature, it differs from the pre-war situation.
    Before the war, Japanese imperialism treated Korea, Taiwan, and Southern Sakhalin as colonies, cruelly exploiting the local people and plundering agricultural products and industrial raw materials at low prices. It also used force to invade the Chinese mainland, importing China's mineral resources through plunder. At the same time, it turned these regions into important markets for exporting light industrial products such as cotton products and groceries, as well as capital. On the other hand, it exported specialized products such as raw silk and porcelain to advanced capitalist countries in Europe and the United States, especially the United States, and imported machinery, cotton, oil, and scrap iron to expand its heavy industry and lay the foundation for an arms race. This was the characteristic of the pre-war Japanese imperialist foreign trade structure. At that time, Japanese textiles and other products had international competitiveness because they possessed extremely cheap labor generated under the semi-feudal land ownership system.
    Eleven years after the end of the war, how does Japan's foreign trade differ from pre-war? Now, let’s compare the foreign trade in 1956 with the pre-war period (1934-1936 average).
    One of the characteristics of Japan's post-war foreign trade is that the trade structure has undergone significant changes in terms of both regions and commodities compared to pre-war. Among the pre-war export regions, Asia accounted for 64% (China and Southeast Asian countries each accounted for 18%), and North America accounted for 17%. After the war, Asia's proportion dropped to 41% (China accounted for 2.7%, and Southeast Asian countries accounted for 25%), while North America's proportion rose to 26% (the United States accounted for 22%). In import regions, Asia accounted for 53% before the war (China accounted for 10%, and Southeast Asian countries accounted for 20%), and after the war, it dropped to 32% (China accounted for 2.6%, and Southeast Asian countries accounted for 20%); before the war, North America accounted for 25%, and after the war, it rose to 44% (the United States accounted for 33%). Obviously, the important reasons for this change are the post-war US imperialist occupation of Japan and the US "embargo" policy against China since 1951.
    Another characteristic is reflected in the changes in commodity types. This is related to the fact that Japan's industrial structure tended to become more advanced during and after the war. Before the war (1934-1936 average), textiles accounted for 52% of export commodities, while hardware, machinery, and chemical products accounted for only 12%. However, in the 1956 exports, the proportion of textiles had dropped to 35%, and the proportion of hardware, machinery, and chemical products had increased to 37%. Even the textiles themselves were different after the war: the proportion of chemical fibers such as rayon and blended fabrics increased, while the proportion of natural fibers such as silk and cotton decreased. In 1956, Japan's exports of ships and blended fabrics ranked first in the world. Among imported commodities, food decreased from 23% to 17%, textile raw materials decreased from 30% to 25%, while the proportion of raw materials for heavy chemical industries increased to 27%. This all shows that heavy chemical industries have taken a dominant position both in the industrial structure and in exports.
    The US occupation policy towards Japan, starting from the goal of turning Japan into a base for aggression against Asia, aided and strengthened Japan's monopoly capital. Japan's monopoly capital fully utilized this condition to revive imperialism. The development pace of Japan's foreign trade since the re-opening of private trade in August 1948 can prove this point. In 1949, Japan was permitted to manufacture previously prohibited overseas navigation vessels; it began to import foreign private capital, especially technology; and it adopted the Dodge Line tax reform to promote capital accumulation. In particular, the US military's "special procurement" orders accompanying the US aggression in the Korean War, and the expansion of world trade, stimulated Japan's industrial production to expand rapidly. Exports increased from 500 million US dollars in 1949 to 800 million US dollars in 1950, and then to 1.3 billion US dollars in 1951. Imports increased from 900 million US dollars in 1949 to 1.9 billion US dollars in 1951. In 1952 and 1953, Japan's export volume remained at around 1.2 billion US dollars, but imports remained above 2 billion US dollars each year, so trade deficits frequently appeared in large amounts. This deficit was made up by the US military's "special procurement." Japan's cumulative trade deficit in the ten years after the war reached 5.3 billion US dollars. However, using 2.1 billion US dollars in counterpart funds for US aid (1945-1952), 3.5 billion US dollars in "special procurement" (1950-1955), and 200 million US dollars in foreign investment (1949-1955), not only made up for this deficit, but by the beginning of 1956, the foreign exchange reserves had reached as much as 1.4 billion US dollars. From this, it can be seen that in the ten years after the war, Japan's foreign trade relied on US aid funds in the first five years, and on the US military's military expenditures in the latter five years, to maintain the balance of international payments and was able to continuously expand. By 1955, Japan began to be able to maintain a balance of trade revenue and expenditure without relying on "special procurement," and also expanded exports.
    Japan's monopoly capital, on the one hand, depended on US imperialism, and on the other hand, strengthened the exploitation of the working class, thus being able to accumulate capital in a short period of time and lay the foundation for economic self-reliance. It was able to do this because, on the one hand, it placed a huge relatively surplus population in the predicament of unemployment and semi-unemployment, and suppressed the wages of employed workers; on the other hand, since 1950, it has rapidly imported foreign technology, replaced outdated equipment, and improved labor productivity to strengthen the exploitation of relative surplus value. Comparing 1955 with 1951, the number of industrial workers only increased by 11%, while production increased by 65%; although labor productivity increased by 48%, actual wages only increased by 22%. In short, Japanese monopoly capital relies on the combination of traditional cheap labor and new technologies to strengthen the exploitation of workers, in order to have competitive power in post-war exports and lay the foundation for today's expansion of trade. However, Japanese monopolists are by no means satisfied with this.
    Before the war, about 20% of the total value of Japanese products was exported, and about 10% was invested in fixed assets. Now, although the scale of production has expanded to about 2.3 times the pre-war level, exports are only about 10%, while investment in fixed assets reaches about 20%. Today, the unprecedented prosperity in the history of Japanese capitalist development is mainly due to the abnormally inflated fixed asset investment following the expansion of exports in 1953. Needless to say, this excessive investment will inevitably lead to a glut of commodities in the future. Industrial products such as textiles, food, household electrical appliances, and fertilizers have shown obvious signs of overproduction. However, monopoly capitalists do not intend to adopt policies to increase workers' wages and expand the domestic consumer market, but instead suppress wages and strengthen the competitiveness of exports, in order to find sales overseas as the basic policy for the economy.
    However, Japan's post-war foreign trade is different from pre-war in that it is largely dependent on the United States. Japan-US trade is not an equal and mutually beneficial relationship, and it is difficult for Japanese monopoly capital to find sales in the United States. Currently, Japan's 500 million US dollars in exports to the United States are mainly light industrial products such as cotton fabrics, sewing machines, toys, and groceries. Since last year, it has encountered obstacles from the United States raising tariffs and restricting imports; when the US economic situation declines, it will be subject to even greater restrictions from the United States. In recent years, the focus of Japan's industry has shifted to heavy industry and chemical industry, but the United States does not want these products. Therefore, Japan's exports to the United States will only decrease and not increase. Conversely, because Japan needs to import important industrial raw materials such as coking coal, scrap iron, oil, and cotton from the United States, Japan's imports greatly exceed its exports to the United States. Currently, Japan imports goods worth a total of 1 billion US dollars from the United States each year, with a large import surplus. It is difficult for Japanese monopoly capital to expand exports to the United States.
    So, where to find a way out? In the past two or three years, Japanese monopoly capital has been making every effort to export machinery and complete sets of equipment to Southeast Asia and South America, ensuring the import of mineral raw materials. The Japanese government has also revised the Export-Import Bank Law, intending to further invest overseas. However, this path is not very optimistic either. Because Japan's activities in these regions will inevitably lead to fierce competition with other imperialist countries.
    At present, some politicians and capitalists in Japan have realized that they should develop equal and mutually beneficial trade with peaceful democratic countries such as China and the Soviet Union, which are undergoing large-scale economic construction. This is a good way out for the Japanese economy. However, the United States is afraid that Japanese monopoly capital will break away from its control and is doing its best to win it over. For example, the United States has placed large orders with Japanese automobile companies and is enticing Japanese monopoly capital with the so-called "Asian Common Market Plan." Under US pressure, the Japanese government has been slow to develop trade with China and the Soviet Union. Since the signs of the recent decline in the US economic situation have become increasingly obvious, Japanese monopoly capital cannot but seriously consider the market issue. Japan, which has always relied on foreign trade as its mainstay, how to solve this acute market problem will be related to its economic prosperity and development. Intelligent Japanese people will see this very clearly.

    战后日本对外贸易
    蓝海
    近两三年来，日本的对外贸易有显著的扩大。从1953到1955年这段时间里，世界贸易的总输出额平均每年增加4％，但同时期的日本输出额平均每年增加16％。尤其是前年和去年的增长率为23％和25％，比世界主要资本主义国家的任何国家都高。日本的输出额在战前占世界第五位，1950年下降为第十七位，但到1955年又上升为第八位了。现在，在帝国主义国家为争夺市场而进行激烈竞争的舞台上，日本又重新出场了。去年的日本对外贸易，出口为二十五亿美元，进口为三十二亿美元，两者都大体上恢复到了战前的水平。但是，就贸易结构和性质来说，却同战前有所不同。
    战前，日本帝国主义把朝鲜、台湾、南库页岛作为殖民地，残酷地剥削当地人民，廉价地掠取农产品和工业原料。它还使用武力侵入中国大陆，以掠夺的手段输入中国的矿产资源。同时，它反过来又把这些地区变成输出棉制品、杂货等轻工业品和资本的重要市场。另一方面，它向欧美先进资本主义国家，尤其是美国，输出特产的生丝、陶磁器等轻工业品，输入机器、棉花、石油、废铁等，扩展自己的重工业，为进行军备竞赛打下基础。这就是战前日本帝国主义对外贸易结构的特点。当时，日本纺织品等具有国际竞争能力，是因为它拥有在半封建土地所有制下产生的极其低廉的劳动力。
    战争结束十一年后的今天，日本对外贸易和战前有什么不同呢？现在把1956年的对外贸易和战前（1934—1936年平均）作一比较来看。
    战后日本对外贸的一个特点是贸易结构论就地区和商品来看，比战前都有很大变化。战前的输出地区中，亚洲占64％（中国和东南亚国家各为18％），北美洲占17％。战后亚洲的比例降为41％（中国为2.7％、东南亚国家为25％），而北美洲的比例却上升为26％（美国为22％）。在进口地区中，战前亚洲为53％（中国为10％，东南亚国家为20％），战后降为32％（中国为2.6％，东南亚国家为20％）；战前北美洲占25％，战后则上升为44％（美国为33％）。显而易见，引起这种变化的重要原因，是战后美帝国主义占领日本和1951年以来美国对中国实行“禁运”政策。
    另一个特点表现在商品种类的变化上。这与通过战时和战后日本产业结构趋于高级化的事实有关。战前（1934—1936年的平均数）在出口商品中，纺织品占52％，五金、机械、化学制品不过占12％。但在1956年的出口中，纺织品的比例已降为35％，五金、机械、化学制品的比重增加到37％。就是纺织品本身在战后也不同了：人造丝、混纺品等化学纤维的比重增加，而丝、棉等自然纤维的比重下降了。在1956年，日本船舶、混纺品的出口额占世界第一位。进口商品中，粮食从23％减到17％，纺织原料从30％减到25％，而重化学工业原料的比重却增为27％。这都说明无论在产业结构或输出中，重化学工业都占了主导地位。
    美国的对日占领政策，从把日本变成侵略亚洲的据点这个目标出发，援助并加强了日本的垄断资本。日本的垄断资本充分地利用这个条件来复活帝国主义。自1948年8月民间贸易重新开放后，日本对外贸易的发展步调，可以证明这一点。1949年日本被准许制造过去被禁止的海外航轮；开始输入外国的私人资本，特别是技术；采取索普税制改革的办法以促进资本的积累。尤其是，伴随美国侵略朝鲜战争而来的美军“特需”订货，和世界贸易的扩大，刺激着日本的工业生产迅速扩大起来。出口从1949年的五亿美元增加到1950年的八亿美元，1951年又增加到十三亿美元。进口从1949年的九亿美元增加到1951年的十九亿美元。在1952和1953年，日本出口额停留在十二亿美元左右，但进口每年仍在二十亿美元以上，所以贸易尾差经常出现大量的赤字。这项赤字是用美军的“特需”来弥补的。日本战后十年内的入超额累计达五十三亿美元。但是用美援对等资金二十一亿美元（1945—1952年）、“特需”三十五亿美元（1950—1955年）、外国投资二亿美元（1949—1955年），不仅弥补了这笔亏空，而且到1956年初所存的外汇已达十四亿美元之多。由此可见，战后十年内日本的对外贸易在前五年靠美援资金，后五年靠美军的军事开支得以维持国际收支的平衡，并且能以不断扩大。到1955年，日本开始不依赖“特需”也差不多能维持贸易收支的平衡，而且还扩大了输出。
    日本的垄断资本，一方面依附于美帝国主义，另一方面又加强了对工人阶级的剥削，因而在短时期内得以积累资本，为经济上的自立打下基础。它所以能做到这一点，是因为一方面把庞大的相对过剩人口置于失业半失业的苦境，并压低在业工人工资；另一方面从1950年以来，迅速地输入外国技术，更换陈旧的设备，提高劳动生产率，以加强相对剩余价值的剥削。拿1955和1951年相比，产业工人只增加11％，而生产却增加65％；劳动生产率虽增加48％，但实际工资不过增加22％。总之，日本垄断资本依靠传统的低廉劳动力同新技术的结合而加强对工人的剥削，以便在战后的输出中握有竞争力量，并为今天扩大贸易奠定基础。但是，日本的垄断资本家决不以此为满足。
    战前，日本的产品总值中，有20％左右出口，还有10％左右作为固定设备的投资。现在，生产规模虽扩大到战前的二点三倍左右，但出口只有10％左右，而作为固定设备投资的达20％左右。今天，日本能出现日本资本主义发展史上空前的繁荣，主要是因为继1953年扩大输出之后，进行了异常膨胀的固定设备投资。不用说，这种过大的投资，将来必然会引起商品的泛滥。纺织、食品、家庭用电器设备、肥料等工业产品，已呈现明显的生产过剩的征兆。但垄断资本家并不打算采取提高工人工资，扩大国内消费市场的政策，反而去压低工资，加强输出的竞争力，以在海外找销路作为经济政策的基本方针。
    然而，战后的日本对外贸易和战前不同，在很大的程度上依附于美国。日美贸易不是平等互惠的关系，日本垄断资本想到美国找销路是很困难的。现在，日本对美输出的五亿美元商品中，以棉织品、缝纫机、玩具、杂货等轻工业品为主，从去年开始已遇到了美国提高关税和限制进口的障碍；等到美国经济情况低落的时候，还会受到美国更大的限制。近年来日本的产业重点已转向重工业和化学工业，但美国不要这些产品。因此，日本对美输出只会有减无增。相反地，由于日本要从美国进口焦煤、废铁、石油、棉花等重要工业原料，日本的进口大大超过对美国的输出。现在日本每年从美国进口的商品，总值十亿美元，入超很多。日本垄断资本想对美国扩大输出是困难重重的。
    那末，到哪里去找出路呢？近两三年来，日本垄断资本竭力向东南亚和南美各国输出机器和成套设备，保证矿产原料的进口。日本政府还修改了输出入银行法，打算进一步向海外投资。但是这条路也并不怎样乐观。因为，日本在这些地区的活动必然会同其他的帝国主义国家发生激烈的竞争。
    目前，日本的一部分政界人士和资本家都认识到应该同正在进行大规模经济建设的中国、苏联等和平民主国家发展平等互惠的贸易。这是日本经济的一个好出路。但是，美国害怕日本垄断资本摆脱它的控制，正在极力进行拉拢。比如美国已向日本汽车公司提出大批订货，并以所谓“亚洲共同市场计划”来引诱日本垄断资本等等。日本政府在美国压力下，在发展同中苏两国的贸易方面迟迟不前。由于近来美国经济情况低落的征兆越来越明显，迫使日本垄断资本不能不认真考虑市场问题了。一向依赖对外贸易为主的日本，如何解决这一尖锐的市场问题，将关系到它的经济的繁荣和发展。有头脑的日本人对这一点都会看得很清楚。
