Egypt Rectifies Foreign Schools
Eliminate Colonialist Cultural Remnants

(Reported by this newspaper) The Egyptian government is taking active measures to eliminate the colonialist influence of schools previously established in Egypt by countries such as Britain and France. The Egyptian Ministry of Education has instructed teachers in all schools to "remove all traces of Anglo-French cultural dominance in children's minds."

In these schools, Egyptian teachers have replaced the British and French teachers who returned home due to the war. According to Egyptian newspapers, some schools run by British and French expatriates will be transferred to the management of Egyptian educational institutions before the start of the next academic year.

In the past, subjects such as history and geography in these foreign schools had to use textbooks in English or French. To change this situation, the Egyptian Ministry of Education has issued a circular abolishing history, geography, and other liberal arts courses in English or French. It has also reiterated the law issued at the end of 1955, requiring foreign schools to use Arabic textbooks for teaching history and geography to students. All Egyptian students must achieve a passing grade of 50 in Arabic language. The Egyptian National Guidance Department has designated a group of professors to rewrite Egyptian history textbooks to correct errors in these books.

According to British press estimates, before the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt last year, foreigners (including British, French, American, Italian, and Greek) ran approximately 280 schools in Egypt, with over 90,000 students. Among these foreign-run schools, Britain accounted for 30, and France over 100.

    埃及整顿外国学校
    清除殖民主义文化遗毒
    本报讯　埃及政府正在采取积极措施，清除以前英、法等国在埃及开办的学校中的殖民主义影响。埃及教育部已指示各学校教师“必须去掉英、法文化统治在儿童思想上的一切遗迹”。
    在这些学校里，埃及教师已经接替因战争关系回国的英、法教师的工作。据埃及报纸说，在下一学年开始以前，将有一部分英、法侨民主办的学校划归埃及教育机构管理。
    过去在这些外国学校中，历史、地理等科目都须使用英文或法文教本。为了改变这种情况，埃及教育部已通令废除英语或法语的历史、地理等文科课程，并重申1955年底发布的外国学校必须使用阿拉伯文的历史、地理课本教育学生的法律。所有埃及学生的阿拉伯语文成绩，必须达到五十分的及格标准。埃及国家指导部已指定一批教授改写埃及历史课本，以纠正这些课本中的错误。
    据英国报刊估计，在去年英、法侵埃战争以前，外国人（包括英、法、美、意大利和希腊）在埃及举办的学校约二百八十所，学生有九万多人。这些外国人办的学校中，英国占三十所，法国一百多所。
