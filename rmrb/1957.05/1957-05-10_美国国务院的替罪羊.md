The U.S. State Department's Scapegoat
	Li Budiao

The United States Information Agency (USIA), the official U.S. propaganda arm, is currently struggling in Congress for its next fiscal year's budget. It is requesting $140 million for the next year, $27 million more than the previous year. However, Congress, which is clamoring for budget cuts, is unwilling to grant it that much and plans to cut its request by $37.9 million.

The USIA is an important tool for the United States in carrying out propaganda and subversive activities abroad. Its subordinate organizations such as the "United States Information Service," "Voice of America," and "RIAS" are all notorious bases for the United States to engage in subversion and incitement activities in other countries. USIA Director Larson revealed in Congress while defending his request for increased funding that this funding would be used to carry out activities in eighty-two countries. More than half of the funds for Europe would be used in the four countries bordering socialist countries, and the remaining 25% would be used in the two Western countries where the Communist Party receives the most votes, presumably referring to France and Italy.

Larson also said that the increase in funding for the next year is because of the need to increase spending in the Near East, especially to pay attention to promoting the Eisenhower Doctrine. He also requested an additional $4 million specifically for building a powerful radio station in the Near East. According to him, this strengthening is necessary because "for many, many years, the Arabs and the peoples of Asia have equated the United States, Great Britain, France, and all others they call 'colonial masters' in their minds."

However, despite the USIA's spending of a large amount of manpower and resources, the results received are very pitiful. The results of a survey conducted by the "New York Times" in several countries are enough to sadden Mr. Larson. For example, West Germany believes that the USIA is "gradually becoming silent and odorless in society." USIA staff in India are "regarded as representatives of a country that opposes India's security interests." And in the Middle East, the U.S. government's Middle East policy makes the USIA's efforts to win over the Arab people have only a "pitifully small impact."

Within the United States, the USIA's work is generally considered a failure. Because it is now actually requesting increased funding, it has been attacked from all sides. And the most unbearable attack for Mr. Larson is that the USIA is "the refuge of those broken-down journalists who have been abandoned by their profession and cannot find a job anywhere."

What are the reasons for the USIA's failure? A recent article by "New York Times" reporter James Reston attempts to point out that this is because the various agencies of the U.S. government cannot, as Eisenhower declared when he first came to power in 1952, "act harmoniously under a general strategic plan."

According to Reston, Larson is not a minor figure. He participates in the cabinet, participates in the National Security Council that makes decisions, and also participates in the Operations Coordinating Board that supervises the implementation of the National Security Council's decisions. It can be seen that he is a well-informed person. However, damn it, American policy and the USIA's propaganda are always unable to "coordinate."

Reston cited several interesting examples of this "lack of coordination." For example, the Pentagon (U.S. Department of Defense) recently decided to send bombers on round-the-world long flights and drop fake atomic bombs in the Asian seas, while the USIA is trying to reduce Asian countries' opposition to the U.S. use of atomic weapons. The Pentagon recently set up an "Atomic Support Command," while the USIA is "desperately trying" to deal with Soviet accusations that the United States is going to wage an atomic war.

The examples cited by Reston themselves already show that this is not a problem of "coordination" or "lack of coordination," but rather that the USIA, even with its eloquent tongue, cannot conceal the aggressive nature of U.S. foreign policy. No wonder this famous reporter, who won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize, could not say after a long time how to "coordinate" the two.

The USIA is led by the U.S. State Department. The failure of the USIA actually reflects the failure of U.S. foreign policy. In the final analysis, the USIA, which is under attack, is just a scapegoat for the State Department.

    美国国务院的替罪羊
    李不雕
    美国的官方对外宣传机构美国新闻署，现在正在国会里面为了它的下一年度的预算而挣扎。它要求下年度拨给它经费一亿四千万美元，比上年度多二千七百万美元。而正在嚷着要削减预算的国会却不肯给它这么多，打算把它的要求削减三千七百九十万美元。
    美国新闻署是美国在国外进行宣传和颠覆活动的重要工具。它下面的“美国新闻处”、“美国之音”、“里亚斯电台”等等机构，都是臭名远扬的美国在别国从事颠覆和煽动活动的大本营。美国新闻署署长拉森在国会里为它的增加经费的要求辩护时就透露，这笔经费将用来在八十二个国家中展开活动。其中用于欧洲的款项，半数以上将用于同社会主义国家相邻的四个国家，而其余的25％将用于西方国家中共产党获取选票最多的两个国家，大概是指的法国和意大利。
    拉森还说，下一年度经费增加，是因为要增加对近东地区的开支，特别是要注意宣传艾森豪威尔主义。他还要求另外拨款四百万美元，专供在近东建立一个强大的广播电台。据他说，这种加强之所以必要，是因为“许多许多年以来，阿拉伯人和亚洲各国人民在自己的意识中一直把美国、英国、法国和一切被他们称为其他‘殖民主子’的人等量齐观。”
    可是，尽管美国新闻署花费了大量的人力物力，所收到的效果却非常可怜。“纽约时报”在几个国家里调查的结果是够使拉森先生伤心的。例如，西德认为美国新闻署“渐渐在社会上无声无嗅”了。在印度的美国新闻署工作人员“被认为是反对印度安全利益的一个国家的代表”。而在中东，美国政府的中东政策使得美国新闻署争取阿拉伯人民的努力只有“小得可怜的影响”。
    在美国国内，美国新闻署的工作普遍被认为是失败的。由于它现在居然还要求增加经费，所以受到了各方面的攻击。而最使拉森先生咽不下去的一种攻击，就是说美国新闻署是“那些被他们的行业所抛弃和在任何地方都不可能找到职业的破落新闻记者们的归宿”。
    美国新闻署失败的原因在哪里呢？“纽约时报”的记者詹·赖斯顿最近的一篇文章试图指出这是由于美国政府的各个机构，不能像艾森豪威尔在1952年刚上台时所宣布的那样，“在总的战略计划之下和谐地行动”。
    据赖斯顿说，拉森不是小角色。他参加内阁，参加决策的国家安全委员会，也参加监督执行国家安全委员会的决定的行动调整局。可见，他是个消息灵通人士。可是，真是见了鬼，美国的政策同美国新闻署的宣传总是“协调”不起来。
    赖斯顿举了几个这种“不协调”的很有意思的例子。例如：五角大楼（美国国防部）最近决定要派轰炸机作环球长行，并且在亚洲海面投掷假的原子弹，而美国新闻署却正在设法减弱亚洲国家对美国使用原子武器的反对。五角大楼最近在搞“原子支持司令部”，而美国新闻署却在“绝望地设法”对付苏联的关于美国要进行原子战争的指责。
    赖斯顿所举的例子本身，就已经说明这不是什么“协调”不“协调”的问题，而是美国新闻署纵有如簧之舌也掩饰不了美国外交政策的侵略本质的问题。无怪乎这位获得1957年普利兹奖金的名记者，说了半天也说不出究竟如何才能使两者“协调”的办法来。
    美国新闻署是受美国国务院领导的。美国新闻署的失败，实际上反映了美国外交政策的失败。归根结底，受到攻击的美国新闻署，不过是国务院的一头替罪羊罢了。
