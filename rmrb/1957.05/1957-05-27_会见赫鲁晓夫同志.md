    Meeting with Comrade Khrushchev
    Tai Yanxiang

Spring. The fortieth spring. We came, and are about to bid farewell to this glorious capital. Moscow, illuminating our thoughts with sunshine, filling our hearts with the east wind. Flocks of gray pigeons fly onto Red Square, accompanied by children laughing and playing like little pigeons; the Red Army marches past, the pigeons unafraid, as if knowing these are their own soldiers. The traffic flows like water, the pedestrians weave like fabric, all footsteps are vigorous, peaceful, and firm. Life is bustling; only one place is solidified with marble-like solemnity, a solemn line walking into a marble-built mausoleum. There sleeps a great and simple man: Lenin. He once walked and shouted at the forefront of the storm, and left an immortal monument for his descendants. Who comes here can not admire his life as heavy as Mount Tai, dedicated to the utmost! Beside Lenin rests Stalin, shining with a loyal heart through the ages, with both merits and faults. Two hundred million loyal hearts – a country belonging to tomorrow: all this is not unfamiliar to us. Over 40,000 miles of voyage, we have overlooked mountains, rivers, and plains. What kind of land has nurtured such people! We are like elementary school students, pointing at the map and reliving the forty years of history. In the great land, among the great people, we have sipped a peculiar wine - it makes the burning heart even hotter, it makes the sober eyes even clearer. Farewell, Moscow! Farewell, the Soviet Union! You are the center of this great red front. Thinking about how mellow, how strong, how enthusiastic the last glass of wine before departure should be! "Room No. 6. Khrushchev N.S.". We gently pushed open one of the two doors. Greeting us was a warm hand, greeting us was a familiar smile. Due to labor and health, this miner's hand is thick and strong, and excessive concern and thinking have deepened the wrinkles on his forehead. The whole world has the Soviet Union in its heart, and the whole world is in the heart of the Soviet Union. Behind Comrade Khrushchev hangs a large map, MИP, the world; MИP, peace. Not in the eloquent tone of a propagandist, but like an old worker talking cordially to young people. Outside the window, the street garden, the newly green linden trees, can also see the situation in the Middle East. We still remember the smoke of gunpowder filling the Suez River, the artillery fire shaking the nerves of the whole world… Moscow spoke. Then a ceasefire within twenty-four hours. The blackout Cairo was re-lit with thousands of lights. The earth rotates, and also revolves, and the years and the hands of the laborers push it into dawn. We are in a place where tomorrow has become yesterday, discussing the struggle to transform from the day before yesterday to today. The United States is doing the bad things it is used to doing in Jordan, the people have been frustrated, but the people will launch a new struggle. Talking about Egypt, Syria, talking about the American conspiracy, the Turkish mercenaries... More than one thing makes our blood boil, but only communists can remain calm. The people are the masters of the earth, wishing it to rotate in the clear sky, so the envelope sent from Moscow does not contain explosives, but peace. The people are the masters of history, there is no other master, if there is, it is the people's ideals and confidence. Four silver airplanes are parked on Khrushchev's desk. Fly, may your wings cover the peaceful earth; if anything happens, you will also be relentless. Comrade Khrushchev spoke happily, even forgetting to drink a sip of water. He spoke freely about the world situation, and also cared about the harvest of the Crimean vineyards. The Sixth Five-Year Plan will bring abundant meat, and everyone, every year, will eat an average of more than ninety kilograms of meat. In the office, we also saw a bunch of abundant wheat ears, we did not ask how far it had traveled; one billion poods, the reclaimed land has already contributed, and grain will also be born in the eternally known hungry grassland. One thing that Khrushchev did not mention, but we thought of, was the food and goods that the Soviet Union sent to fraternal countries. "Workers of all countries, unite!" Unite into a battle line, unite into a family. "We Soviet people love the Chinese people." Comrade Khrushchev told us that this friendship began with the October Revolution, and many Chinese people participated in the Red Guards that year... Time has proven the strength of this friendship, whether in times of difficulty or in victory. "In order to make China strong, we are willing to pay any price." We understand the weight of this sentence, understand the feelings you had when you said this. In order to make our motherland strong and prosperous, to make the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism even stronger, we are also willing to pay any price, and continue to struggle like in the past years. Forever and ever, the Soviet Union is the most faithful friend of the Chinese people; forever and ever, the Chinese people are the dearest brothers of the Soviet Union. How do I end this poetic report? Comrade Khrushchev entrusted us to convey endless friendship to the Chinese people. The best words are like boiling blood, dripping from his heart into our hearts: "The Soviet people and the Central Committee of the CPSU send greetings to the Communist Party of China, and greetings to the comrades of the Central Committee of the CPC. The whole of China welcomed Voroshilov, which is another demonstration of the friendship and love between the Chinese and Soviet people; we hope to invite Comrade Mao Zedong to our place, please have him prepare to receive our welcome."
    In late March of this year, the Chinese journalists' delegation to the Soviet Union visited the Soviet Union and stayed there for forty-two days. This poem was written by the author on May 8 after Comrade Khrushchev met with the delegation.

    会见赫鲁晓夫同志
    邰燕祥春天。第四十个春天。我们来到了，又行将告别这光荣的京城。莫斯科，以阳光照耀着我们的思想，以东风鼓满我们的心胸。成群灰色的鸽子飞落在红场上，伴着像小鸽子似的笑闹的幼童；红军橐橐地走过，鸽子并不吃惊，仿佛知道这是自己的士兵。车流如水，人行如织，所有的步伐，振奋、安详、坚定。生活在喧腾；只有一处凝结着大理石般的肃静，肃静的行列走入大理石砌的陵门。那儿睡着一个伟大而质朴的人：列宁。他曾在暴风雨的前端奔走呼号，又把不朽的丰碑留传给子孙，谁来到这儿能不崇敬他重如泰山的、鞠躬尽瘁的一生！列宁身边安息着斯大林，透过千秋功过，闪耀着一颗丹心。两万万颗丹心——一个属于明天的国家：这一切对我们并不陌生。四万里航程中鸟瞰了山河平野，怎样的土地哺育了这样的人民！我们像小学生，一边指点着地图，一边把四十年历史重温。在伟大的国土上，在伟大的人民中，我们啜饮了一种奇异的酒——它使燃烧的心更加火热，它使不醉的眼更加清明。再见吧，莫斯科！再见吧，苏联！你这伟大的红色阵线的中心。揣想着临行的最后一杯酒该多么醇、多么浓烈、多么热情！“第六号房间。赫鲁晓夫·尼·谢”。我们轻轻地推开了两扇门中的一扇门。迎接我们的是温暖的手，迎接我们的是熟悉的笑容。由于劳动和健康，这双矿工的手粗厚而有力，过多的关心和思考，加深了额前的皱纹。全世界的心里都有苏联，全世界都在苏联心中。赫鲁晓夫同志背后张挂着大幅地图，MИP，世界；MИP，和平。不是以鼓动家的雄辩的语调，而像一个老工人对青年亲切谈心。窗外，街心花园，初绿的菩提树，可也能望见中东的风云。还记得硝烟弥漫在苏伊士河上，炮火震动了全世界的神经……莫斯科发言了。于是二十四小时之内停火。灯火管制的开罗重又亮起千万盏明灯。地球自转着，又公转着，岁月和劳动者的手把它推入了黎明。我们在明天已经变成昨天的地方，谈论着为从前天转变到今天的斗争。美国在约旦干着干惯了的坏事，人民受挫了，但是人民将掀起新的斗争。谈论着埃及、叙利亚，谈论着美国的阴谋、土耳其的雇佣兵……不止一件事教我们热血沸腾，只是共产主义者能够保持冷静。人民是地球的主人，愿它在晴空中团圞运转，因此莫斯科送出的信封里，装的不是炸药，而是和平。人民是历史的主人，此外再没有什么主宰，如果有，那就是人民的理想和信心。四架银色的飞机停留在赫鲁晓夫的办公桌上。飞翔吧，你们的翅膀覆盖着安宁的大地；一旦有事，你们也将会叱咤无情。赫鲁晓夫同志说得高兴，甚至都没想到喝一口水。他纵谈着天下大势，也关怀着克里米亚葡萄园的收成。第六个五年计划将带来丰富的肉类，每个人，每一年，平均食肉量要超过九十公斤。在办公室里，我们还看见一束丰硕的麦穗，我们没问它经过了多远的路程；十亿普特，垦荒地已经贡献，千古传名的饥饿草原，也将有粮食诞生。有一点，赫鲁晓夫不曾谈到，我们却想到了苏联送给兄弟国家的粮食和物品。“全世界无产者，联合起来！”联合成一条战线，联合成一个家庭。“我们苏联人民热爱中国人民。”赫鲁晓夫同志告诉我们，这种友谊开始于十月革命，当年许多中国人参加过赤卫军……时间证明了这种友谊的力量，无论在患难中，在胜利中。“为了使中国强大起来，我们愿意付出任何代价。”我们懂得这句话的重量，懂得你说这句话时候的感情。为了使我们的祖国强大繁荣，使和平、民主、社会主义阵营更加强盛，我们也愿意付出任何代价，像过去的年代一样继续斗争。永远地，永远地，苏联是中国人民最忠实的朋友；永远地，永远地，中国人民是苏联最亲爱的弟兄。我怎样结束这一篇诗的报道？赫鲁晓夫同志委托我们向中国人民转达永无止境的友情。最好的话像滚热的血，从他的心滴进我们的心：“苏联人民和苏共中央问候中国共产党，问候中共中央的同志们。整个的中国欢迎了伏罗希洛夫，这是中苏人民友谊和爱情的又一次示威；我们希望邀请毛泽东同志到我们这里来，请他准备好接受我们的欢迎。”
    今年三月底，中国新闻工作者访苏代表团曾访问了苏联，在苏联逗留了四十二天，这首诗是作者在5月8日赫鲁晓夫同志接见该团后所写。
