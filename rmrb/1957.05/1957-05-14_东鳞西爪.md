	Busy Salt Production Under Sunny Skies
	This newspaper reports, according to the Tianjin Daily, that in the sunny month of May, salt flowers bloom all over the Bohai beach. The daily output of each salt field under the Changlu Salt Administration Bureau is continuously increasing. From May 1st to 10th, more than 100,000 tons of salt have already been produced, nearing half of the monthly plan.
	The tense situation of this spring's salt production is unprecedented. The labor enthusiasm of the vast salt workers is very high, and the efficiency of salt raking is increasing daily. Since the 6th, each pool has produced an average of more than one ton of salt per day; the entire area produces more than 10,000 tons of salt a day, with the highest record on the 10th – more than 15,000 tons. With so much salt being raked, the salt transport workers are kept very busy. They transport an average of 13 to 16 tons of salt per person per day (the quota is 9 tons). During tense times, auxiliary workers also participate in salt transport. However, as soon as they transport the newly raked salt from the edge of the pool, the salt raking workers rake even more new salt from the pool, making it impossible to transport it all. The salt workers say, "We haven't completed the salt production plan for three years. This time, we must greatly increase production."

    风和日丽晒盐忙
    本报讯　据天津日报载在风和日丽的5月，盐花开遍了渤海滩。长芦塘大盐务局各盐场的日产量不断提高，5月1日到10日，已经产盐十万多吨，接近月计划的一半。
    今年春晒的紧张情况是历年没有的。广大盐工的劳动热情非常高涨，扒盐的效率日益提高，6日起，平均每个池子每天产一吨多盐；全区一天产盐一万多吨，10日产盐纪录最高——一万五千多吨。盐扒得多，就忙坏了运盐工人。他们每人每天平均运盐达十三到十六吨（定额九吨）。紧张的时候，辅助工人也参加运盐。但是，他们刚把池边扒出不久的盐运走，扒盐工人把更多的新盐又从池子里扒出来了，运也运不完。盐工们说：“咱们已经有三年没完成产盐计划了，这一回可得大大增产。”
