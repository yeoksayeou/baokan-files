Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 18th: Voroshilov delivered a speech at the Indonesian Parliament this morning. He said that the friendship between Indonesia and the Soviet Union is growing closer. He said that the Soviet people not only sympathize with the just struggle of the Indonesian people but also provide assistance. Indonesia's just demand in the United Nations to recover West Irian is supported by the Soviet Union and other freedom-loving countries.

Voroshilov said that the time is not far off when the remnants of colonialism will be buried forever, and for this, it is necessary for all independence-loving nations to strengthen their unity and friendship with each other.

Voroshilov praised the Bandung Conference as "the best proof of the greater unity of the Eastern countries and the significant role they play in solving international problems."

Speaking of the common aspirations of the two peoples for peaceful construction, Voroshilov said: "The Soviet Union attaches great importance to Indonesia's contribution to consolidating world peace." He said that the Soviet Union would not attack anyone, but based on past experience, in preparation for retaliating against the imperialists' bandit-like attacks, the Soviet Union was also forced to produce military technology products, including atomic and hydrogen weapons.

He said: We say in a loud voice that the era of imperialists monopolizing atomic weapons is over. Under the current conditions, aggressors cannot evade retaliation anywhere in the world. Voroshilov reiterated the Soviet Union's consistent position and desire for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Voroshilov said that the friendship between the Soviet Union and Indonesia, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has a good development. He believes that contacts between the leaders of the two countries are of great benefit in increasing mutual understanding and developing friendship.

Before Voroshilov's speech, Parliament Speaker Sardono delivered a speech warmly welcoming him.

Sardono said that Voroshilov's visit has made the friendship between the Indonesian and Soviet peoples, who are advancing on the road to world peace, even closer.

    伏老在印度尼西亚议会发表演说
    永远埋葬殖民主义的时期不远了
    侵略者目前不可能在世界任何地方躲避反击
    新华社雅加达18日电　伏罗希洛夫今天上午在印度尼西亚国会发表演说。他说，印度尼西亚和苏联之间的友谊正在日趋密切。他说，苏联人民不仅同情印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争，而且给予帮助。印度尼西亚在联合国中提出的关于收复西伊里安的正义要求受到苏联和其他爱好自由的国家的支持。
    伏罗希洛夫说，现在离永远埋葬殖民主义残余的时期已经不远了，为此需要各个爱独立的民族加强彼此之间的团结和友谊。
    伏罗希洛夫赞扬万隆会议“是东方国家更加团结以及他们在解决国际问题上起着重大作用的最好证明”。
    伏罗希洛夫在谈到两国人民对和平建设的共同愿望时说：“苏联非常重视印度尼西亚为巩固世界和平所作的贡献”。他说，苏联不会进攻任何人，但是基于过去的经验，为准备反击帝国主义的强盗式进攻，苏联也被迫生产军事技术方面的产品，包括原子武器和氢武器。
    他说：我们以响亮的声音说，帝国主义者垄断原子武器的时期已经过去了。在目前的条件下，侵略者不可能在世界任何地方躲避反击。伏罗希洛夫重申苏联对于裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的一贯立场和愿望。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联和印度尼西亚之间基于和平共处五项原则的友谊有很好的发展。他认为两国领袖之间的接触在增加彼此了解和发展友谊方面有很大的益处。
    在伏罗希洛夫演讲之前，议长沙多诺致词热烈欢迎。
    沙多诺说，伏罗希洛夫的访问使得在向世界和平道路上前进的印度尼西亚和苏联两国人民之间的友谊更加密切了。
