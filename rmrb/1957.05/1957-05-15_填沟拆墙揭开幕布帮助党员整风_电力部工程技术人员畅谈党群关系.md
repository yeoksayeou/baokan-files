Filling Ditches, Demolishing Walls, Unveiling Curtains: Helping Party Members in Rectification
Engineering and Technical Personnel of the Ministry of Electric Power Discuss Party-Masses Relations

(Our Dispatch) At a forum held by the Ministry of Electric Power, attended by over one hundred intellectuals, senior intellectuals and democratic parties' members of the ministry expressed that there were ditches, walls, and curtains between the Party and the masses within the Ministry of Electric Power. With the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, they voiced their opinions to help the Party fill the ditches, demolish the walls, unveil the curtains, and help Party members to conduct this rectification study well.

This forum, which began on May 7, has been held four times, with twenty-eight people having already spoken.

Zhang Changling said: Grasping minor faults and labeling with big hats leaves non-Party members at a loss.

Zhang Changling, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Hydroelectric Construction Bureau, said: Sometimes, the leadership demands too much and too high in their work, and along with that come too many "hats." If things are slightly inappropriate, it's labeled as conservatism or rashness, putting those doing the work in a difficult position and making timid people feel at a loss. Because everyone is afraid of trouble, their work is often characterized by pushing responsibility to each other and dragging things out. No one dares to boldly take on responsibility. It is right to have certain requirements for work, but the requirements should be based on the situation and should be appropriate. One cannot grasp a minor fault and label it with a big hat.

Luo Xiaoxu said: The fundamental problem is that Party members do not trust non-Party members.

Luo Xiaoxu, an accountant in the Finance Department, said: Some say there is a wall between the Party and the masses, and some say there is a ditch. I think it is more accurate to say there is a curtain. The curtain is lowered from above, and its opening and closing are controlled by those on the stage (of course, I am not referring to the curtain that imperialists call the Iron Curtain or the Bamboo Curtain). The separation between the Party and the masses manifests in many ways. The fundamental problem is that Party members do not trust and are not at ease with non-Party members. In fact, things should be divided into two categories: one is what should be known, and the other is what should not be known. It should be understood that intellectuals have a certain ability to judge, and they can judge for themselves. They won't ask to know things that shouldn't be known. Intellectuals strongly resent the practice of not wanting to let people know anything. Intellectuals like to broaden their horizons, just like a capable housewife likes to go to the department store to pick things out herself, rather than having someone pick things out and send them to her. Intellectuals have self-respect and don't want to be controlled or restricted by others. When I was in the Northeast, the shortwave radio was cut off, which, although it was during the Korean War, was still not a clever thing to do. I still have opinions about this matter to this day. Of course, the situation is different now, and the *Reference News* has expanded its circulation to one million people. Premier Zhou said in his report that there are five million intellectuals in the country, which means that 20% of intellectuals can see it, and 80% cannot. Those who see it are naturally satisfied, but those who don't see it must be dissatisfied. In fact, it is the 80% that should be looked at, because even if the 20% are not shown, they can still know something, while the 80% cannot know without seeing it. Why not let these 80% see it? Is it afraid that they cannot analyze and criticize it? In fact, this is also excessive fear, underestimating the masses. The underestimation of the masses is manifested in many ways. For example, at the beginning of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, it was estimated that counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements accounted for several percent, which is at least 1%, and could be as high as 9%. But this time I heard Assistant Minister Gao's report that our ministry only has a few thousandths. Of course, the situation in other ministries may be different. In short, it shows that the masses are underestimated, and it is thought that there are many problems below. Of course, my opinion is not that young people should also be allowed to see Ah Fei movies. My opinion is not absolute.

Non-Party members also do not trust Party members. Indeed, some Party members are not worthy of trust. Many non-Party members dare to doubt but do not dare to speak. I heard a comrade who returned from abroad say that after he returned to the Northeast, Gao Gang received him. He saw Gao Gang smoking 555 cigarettes and immediately suspected why he didn't smoke Chinese cigarettes, but he didn't dare to say it. In the Northeast, many cadres said, "Gao Gang's word counts." I couldn't understand at the time whether this showed Gao Gang's high prestige or dictatorship? I still don't fully understand it. Of course, Gao Gang is finished now, but this phenomenon is very common. For example, when our ministry issues documents, the subordinates don't look at what it is about, but only look at whether it says "Liu" or "Wang." We all do this. When conveying a report, if it is said that Premier Zhou said it, the impression is deeper.

Then, Luo Xiaoxu continued: There are also contradictions in the relationship between leaders and the led. There is such a thing in the Finance Department: the fly ash from power plants can be used as raw materials for cement and can be sold for money. In the past, it was stipulated that the money would be used as cost. This year, at the meeting of the heads of finance departments, the various administrations requested that they be allowed to handle the fly ash themselves. The minister agreed to give half of it to be used as a factory director's fund, which could be used as a bonus. The cadres of our Finance Department did not agree, because it did not conform to the principle of increasing production and practicing economy and building the country diligently and thriftily. They reported this opinion to the director of the department. One director said, "This is also decentralization of financial power, and it is not easy to change what the minister has said." Although they had been in charge of finance for several years, our Finance Department was still unclear about how much fly ash there was in the country and how much it was worth. Later, after looking into the matter at Shijingshan, they realized that the numbers were not small, so they once again raised their opinion to another director. But this director also said, "The minister has already agreed, so it is not easy to change." The two directors really "had the same idea." Later, after our department fought for it, it was changed to half being handed over to the state and half being controlled by the factory director, but not as a bonus but as an extra-plan capital construction expenditure.

Two problems can be seen from this incident: 1. Making decisions without investigation or research, without knowing how much fly ash there is; 2. "It is not easy to change what the minister has agreed to." It would not be surprising to say this ten years ago. I also came from the old society. Although I was not a high official in the past, I heard others say this, and I also said it myself. Precisely because I was influenced by the old society, I am particularly sensitive to this. I believe that if the minister's decision is wrong, it should be changed, and if the opinion of the general cadres is correct, it should be done. A comrade from the Ministry of Finance also disagreed with the handling of this issue. We reported it to the director, and the director said, "Who can his opinion represent? The Ministry of Finance can't control it either!" This can be linked to "Gao Gang's word counts." Is it because this comrade is not an authority in the Ministry of Finance?

Wang Wene said: If the superior is wrong, it is said to be dialectics; if the subordinate is wrong, there is nothing to say, only to be criticized.

Wang Wene, an engineer at the Beijing Electric Power Design Branch, said: I think the contradiction between leaders and the led is the most prominent contradiction in the organs. The reason for saying this is that if the subordinate makes a mistake, he will be criticized and asked to make a self-criticism; if the superior makes a mistake, even if it is a 180-degree turn, it can be said to be dialectics, the situation has changed, etc. It is also because the superior understands the overall situation and can speak accurately, while the subordinate does not understand the situation comprehensively and can easily speak one-sidedly and make mistakes. But there are superiors above the superiors, so some people think that the higher the level, the more their words count, and everything must be brought up by the superiors. For example, if a designer has an opinion on his work, the words of his direct leader—the group leader—often do not solve the problem; it has to be the director of the office, the dean, or the minister who speaks. Some comrades even advocate that the State Council should come out and speak.

There is bureaucracy and subjectivism in the leadership. For example, in the competition, the slogan of "no mistakes in a hundred drawings" was put forward. Now the facts have proved that it is impossible. In fact, one only needs to think about it to know how it can be guaranteed that not even a line will be drawn incorrectly in a hundred drawings!

Because of the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership, three situations have emerged, which can also be summarized with three words: "transfer," "wait," and "grab." The first is "transfer": all the instructions from above are transferred as they are, and everything is the responsibility of the superiors anyway. The second is "wait": wait and see the movements of the "command platform." The third is "grab": quickly compete for "name" and quickly grab for "profit." Everyone is grabbing for the benefit of their own unit. Otherwise, they will eat "empty pills." For example, regarding wage levels, all the units that grabbed went up, and some units believed the empty promises of the leadership: "Don't grab, we will give you appropriate adjustments later." They didn't participate in the grab and were a little modest, and as a result, the problem has not been solved.

Wang Wene also said: There is a gap between Party members and non-Party members. Non-Party members feel that Party members are different: they have high political status, are easily promoted, are trusted by the leadership, and have prestige among the masses. Non-Party members approach Party members on the surface, but it is not a comrade-like approach. They are very careful when speaking and have reservations. Many comrades confuse the leadership of the Party with the leadership of Party members. Some Party members think, "I am the Party, and only I am right." Therefore, they cannot be criticized. Many comrades below also think that only the leadership of Party members is the leadership of the Party, and without the leadership of Party members, there is no leadership of the Party. This puts non-Party leading cadres in a double-edged sword situation. This is the reason why non-Party leading cadres have no power or dare not use power.

Xiao Jihe said: It's not persuasion, but coercion, using the hat of having political problems to suppress people at every turn.

Xiao Jihe, Director of the Technical Department of the Hydroelectric Bureau, said that the Party's leading comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the progress of intellectuals. Just after liberation, because it was felt that these people had complicated histories, had studied for a few more years, and had learned more, they were unwilling to approach them. There was some reason for this, and it was necessary to be vigilant. Now it has been seven or eight years, but in the minds of some comrades, they still estimate intellectuals from the old society with the old perspective. Many of the comrades present today have been abroad and have personally experienced the oppression suffered by Chinese people in the old society, so the vast majority are very patriotic. But many Party comrades, especially the leading comrades of the lower-level enterprises, still think that the old intellectuals' thinking is very backward and have not considered the impact of the country's progress on them in recent years. If anyone has seen the facts of recent years with their own eyes and still does not support the Communist Party and does not love the country, then that person has no conscience. Party leading comrades rarely meet with these comrades ideologically. They only talk about work and not about ideology. They often do not carefully consider the opinions of these comrades and refuse to accept them, which affects their enthusiasm.

In the past, some comrades were there to coerce people, not to persuade them. For example, they would say that there was a political problem or even put on the hat of reaction. But how big is the problem exactly? How serious is it? How does it affect the current work, wages, and treatment? The work, wages, and treatment of some comrades are indeed inappropriate. Has the enthusiasm of these comrades been brought into play? They feel that the direction is unclear and want to petition to the higher authorities. Since other comrades have such opinions, and I have heard them, I should report them to the Party, so I am saying a few words here today. If the comrades in the ministry go down to work, they can conduct a detailed understanding, which will be good for improving the Party's prestige and for bringing their enthusiasm into play.

Li Yunchi said: Parents teach their children to love their children. Why doesn't the Party love and care for cadres like this?

Li Yunchi of the Electric Power Design Branch said: In terms of political and ideological education, the Party has little else besides general political studies. The Party committee and other leading cadres have never talked to me. When the Party committee calls me, I know they want me to write supporting materials. Of course, writing supporting materials is necessary, but there should be something else besides that. In addition, the method of solving ideological problems is relatively simple, and it is easy to form the practice of suppressing people with big hats. It is better to care for and love comrades frequently from specific matters. I often think, why doesn't hitting children cause parents to "lose prestige" among their children? This is because parents usually care for and love them, and hitting them once in a while will not affect the relationship between them. Why can't political and ideological work be done like this?

Deng Caishou said: Don't suppress us, and don't praise us.

Deng Caishou of the Beijing Hydroelectric Design Institute said: The leadership comrades' criticism and help to the cadres should be appropriate. In the past, encouraging the enthusiasm of young people fostered pride in young people. When criticizing the shortcomings of old engineers, do not damage the little bit of enthusiasm that these comrades originally had. We are only in our forties now. I hope you don't call us "old engineers." We are not old yet. During the Three Kingdoms period, Huang Zhong refused to admit that he was old. Calling us old engineers will make people feel old prematurely. In foreign countries, "old engineer" is a glorious title, indicating that he has experience and is respected by everyone; while in China, it is not the case. In some occasions, it is actually a synonym or equivalent for conservatism and backwardness. Of course, it is different now, and old engineers are all encouraged, but these encouragements seem to throw people into the air. In the past, there was suppression, and now there is praise, which makes people confused. Suppression and praise are really unbearable. Old engineers do not hope to be suppressed, nor do they hope to be praised. They only hope to receive appropriate treatment.

Zhang Jintang said: Why does the appraisal made by an engineer not count unless a Party member signs it?

Engineer Zhang Jintang of the Technical Improvement Bureau mentioned three points in his speech: First, Party members have an obligation to report the situation to the Party. The problem is that if some situations are reported incorrectly, the leadership believes them without investigation and research, causing the non-Party masses to suffer a lot. For example, during the "Three Antis" movement, I requested that the leadership correct the right-leaning actions, but the Party members reported that it was to correct the "left"-leaning thoughts. At that time, it was precisely the time to oppose right-leaning, which caused me to suffer a lot.

Second, there is a lack of trust in the non-Party masses. For example, a generator in Yunnan burned out. Ten engineers were invited to make an appraisal. The conclusion was a technical operational error. All ten engineers signed it, but none of the ten people were Party members, so the leadership did not believe this appraisal and ended up arresting the operating personnel.

Third, some comrades say that non-Party masses have positions but no power. I think they have neither positions nor power. The leaders of the lower-level units often think that only when all levels of leadership are equipped with Party member cadres can the Party's leadership be strengthened. For example, the head of the communications section of the Yunnan Electric Power Bureau is a Party member. He has only been doing communications work for two or three years. His master happens to be in his section, and both sides feel very awkward, and we also feel very awkward. Finding him to talk about problems does not solve them because he doesn't understand. So the reason such problems arise may be that Party members have the valuable quality of being very obedient, doing whatever the superiors say, while non-Party comrades often raise objections. I think we should "use people according to their talents."

Zheng Zhaoji said: I was criticized for being "too bourgeois" for inviting Party members to my home for a cup of coffee.

Engineer Zheng Zhaoji of the Technical Improvement Bureau said: Once, a Party member came to my house to play, and I made him a cup of coffee. I was very sincere at the time. But a week later, at a group meeting, I was criticized for being too bourgeois because of this. This was really laughable. In this way, non-Party members are wary of Party members. Once, a leading comrade went to my friend's house to play. Originally, my friend's wife was killing a chicken at the back door, but we didn't eat chicken at dinner because we were afraid of being criticized for having bourgeois thoughts.

These two things are jokes, but there are many similar things.

Just after liberation, we never thought Party members were scary, but why do we still feel there is a wall after spending these years together? The above is the reason. How to tear down this wall depends to a large extent on the Party, especially on Party member leading comrades; of course, non-Party comrades must also actively and without any hesitation reflect the situation and have confidence. In short, it depends on the efforts of both sides. It won't work just to shout empty slogans.

Zhang Jingtai said: Don't treat intellectuals as stagnant equipment.

Engineer Zhang Jingtai of the Production Department said that old intellectuals do not demand to become Party members, but they demand appropriate treatment. I hope the leadership will not treat us as "stagnant equipment" and only deal with us when we can be disposed of. Last year, a group was handled when the Technical Reform Bureau was established, and another group was handled when the Power Academy was established. Moreover, when handling this "stagnant equipment," we often don't look at the specifications. We often use 220 volts on 20,000 volts and 25,000 volts on 6,000 volts. The leadership should have an in-depth understanding of these cadres to see the specifications. Although people don't have name brands, you can understand them if you put in the effort. Don't let a 12-inch I-beam be used as a 2-inch angle iron, and don't let a 3-inch angle iron be used as a 12-inch I-beam.

This meeting will continue to be held.

    填沟拆墙揭开幕布帮助党员整风
    电力部工程技术人员畅谈党群关系
    本报讯　在电力工业部召开的有一百多个知识分子参加的座谈会上，这个部的高级知识分子和民主党派的人士，认为电力工业部的党群之间，有鸿沟，有围墙，也有幕布。他们本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神，把意见讲出来，帮助党来填沟、拆墙、揭幕，帮助党员把这次整风学习搞好。
    这次的座谈会，从5月7日开始，已经开过四次，在会上发言的已经有二十八人。
    张昌龄说：抓小辫子，戴大帽子，使党外人士手足无措。
    水电建设总局副总工程师张昌龄说：领导上有时对工作的要求太多、太高，随之而来的是“帽子”也太多了，稍不合适，就是保守主义或冒进，使做工作的人进退两难，使胆小的人手足无措。由于大家怕事，因而表现在工作上往往是互相推和拖。谁也不敢大胆地把责任承担下来。对工作应该有一定的要求，这是对的，但要求要根据情况，要求应该合适，不能抓个小辫子，就戴个大帽子。
    罗孝胥说：根本问题是党员对非党员不信任不放心
    财务司会计师罗孝胥说：有人说党群之间有道墙，也有人说有道鸿沟，我认为还是说有道幕比较恰当。幕是从上边落下来的，开与闭都由台上人控制（当然我说的不是帝国主义所说的铁幕、竹幕的幕）。党群间隔膜表现很多，根本问题，是党员对非党员不够信任，不放心。其实，事情应该分成两类：一类是该知道的，一类是不该知道的。要知道知识分子有一定的判断能力，他自己能够判断，不该知道的东西他也不会要求知道。那种什么都不想叫人知道的作法，知识分子是很有反感的。知识分子喜欢开开眼界，就像一个能干的主妇，喜欢自己上百货公司挑东西，而不喜欢人家把东西挑好了给她送来。知识分子有自尊心，不愿受人支配、受人限制。我在东北的时候，收音机的短波被卡断了，虽然正值抗美援朝，但还是不聪明的做法。对这件事直到现在我还有意见。当然，现在情况不同了，参考消息扩大了发行面，能看到的有一百万人。周总理报告中说全国有五百万知识分子，就是说20％的知识分子能看到了，还有80％没看到。看到的人当然心满意足，但没有看到的人一定不满足。其实应该看的是那80％，因为这20％即使不给他看，他也能知道一些，那80％不看就无法知道。为什么不给这80％看呢？是怕他们不能分析批判吗？其实这也是过分害怕，对群众估计不足。对群众估计不足的表现是很多的，例如，肃反开始，说估计反革命分子和其他坏分子有百分之几，这就是起码1％，多可多至9％。但这次听到高部长助理报告我们部才千分之几，当然别的部情况也可能有些不同。总之是说明了对群众估计不足，认为下面问题多。当然，我的意见不是说阿飞电影也让青年去看，我的意见不是绝对化的。
    非党员对党员也不信任，确实有些党员也不足以信任。许多非党员是敢疑不敢言。我听一位从外国回来的同志说，他回来以后到东北，高岗接见他，他看见高岗抽三炮台香烟，当时就怀疑，为什么不抽中国烟，但是没敢说。在东北有很多干部说：“高岗说了才算”。我当时就弄不懂，这究竟说明高岗的威信高呢还是独裁？直到现在我还理解不透彻。当然高岗现在是完了，不过这种现象很普遍。例如我们部里发文，下边不看是什么事，只看是“刘”字还是“王”字。我们大家也这样，传达报告，如果说是周总理讲的，印象就深一些。
    接着罗孝胥又说：领导与被领导关系方面也有矛盾。财务司有这样一件事，发电厂煤灰可以做水泥的原料，可以卖钱，这些钱过去规定充作成本，今年开财务处长会议，各管理局要求由他们自己来处理煤灰，部长同意给一半作为厂长基金，可用作奖励。我们财务司的干部不赞成，因为不符合增产节约勤俭建国的原则。他们向司长反映这个意见，一位司长说：“这也是财权下放，同时部长说了话不大好改变。”虽然管了几年财务，但当时我们财务司还不清楚全国到底有多少煤灰，值多少钱。以后到石景山摸了一下，才知道数字不小，因此又再度向另一位司长提出意见。可是这位司长也说：“部长已经答应了，不好改变。”两位司长真是“英雄所见，不谋而合”。以后经过我们司力争的结果才改为一半上缴，一半由厂长支配，但不作为奖金而作为计划外的基建开支。
    从这件事可以看出两个问题：一、不调查不研究，不知道煤灰有多少就作出决定；二、“部长答应了不好改变”。这句话如果在十年前说不奇怪。我也是旧社会来的，过去虽然没有做大官，但听见别人这样说过，自己也这样说过，正因为我受旧社会熏染，所以对此特别敏感。我认为部长的决定错了也应当改，一般干部的意见正确也应该做。对这个问题的处理，财政部来的一位同志也不大同意，我们向司长反映了，司长说：“他的意见能代表谁？财政部也管不了！”这可以与“高岗说了才算”联系一下。是不是因为这个同志不是财政部的权威人士呢？
    王文谔说：上级错了，说这是辩证法；下级错了，无话可说，只有挨批评。
    北京电力设计分院工程师王文谔说：我认为领导与被领导的矛盾是机关中最突出的矛盾。所以这样说，是由于下级做错了，要受批评，要检讨，上级有错误，即使来个一百八十度的大转弯，可以说成这是辩证法，情况变了等等；也由于上级了解全面情况，说话容易说得准确，而下级了解情况不全面，说话也就容易片面，容易说错。但是上级还有上级，因此有些人认为越是上级说话越算话，什么事都要上级来出头。例如一个设计人员对工作有意见，他的直接领导者——组长说话往往不解决问题，非要室主任、院长、部长说话才行。有些问题有的同志还主张要国务院出来说话。
    领导上有官僚主义和主观主义，例如在竞赛中提出“百张图纸不出差错”的口号，现在事实已经证明是不可能的，其实只要想一想就可以知道，在一百张图纸中怎么能保证连一条线也不画错！
    由于领导上的官僚主义和主观主义，因此出现了三种情况，也可以用三个字来概括，即：“转、望、抢”。第一是“转”：上边的指示都照转，反正一切都由上边负责。第二是“望”：观望“指挥台上”的动向。第三是“抢”：有“名”快争，有“利”快抢，大家都为本单位的好处抢。否则要吃“空心丸”。例如工资级别，凡是抢的单位都提上去了，有的单位相信了领导上的空头支票：“不要抢，下去给你们适当调整。”没有参加抢，谦虚了一些，结果就一直得不到解决。
    王文谔又说：党员与非党员间有隔膜。非党员觉得党员与众不同：政治待遇高，易被提拔，领导上信任，在群众中也有威信。非党员对党员表面上接近，但不是同志式的接近，说话时都很留神，还有保留。有许多同志把党的领导与党员的领导混为一谈。有些党员认为“我就是党，唯有我正确。”因此批评不得。下边许多同志也认为只有党员的领导才是党的领导，没有党员领导同志就是没有党的领导。这就使非党员的领导人两面受攻。这就是造成非党领导干部有职无权或有权不敢使的原因。
    萧季和说：不是说服，而是压服，动不动就用有政治问题的帽子压人。
    水电总局技术处长萧季和说，党内领导同志对知识分子的进步认识不足。刚解放时，因为感到这些人历史复杂，又多念了几年书，多学了些东西，不愿与之接近，还有些道理，有必要提高警惕。现在已经七、八年了，但在有的同志思想中，还是以旧眼光来估计旧社会出来的知识分子。今天在座的同志中好多人去过外国，都亲身体会到在旧社会作一个中国人所受的压迫，所以绝大多数都是非常爱国的。而党内好多同志，特别是下边企业单位的领导同志，还认为旧知识分子思想很落后，没有考虑到几年来国家进步对他们的影响。要是哪个人亲眼看到这几年来的事实，而还对共产党不拥护，还不爱国，那这个人太没有良心了。党员领导同志和这些同志思想见面很少，只谈工作，不谈思想，对这些同志提的意见，往往没有好好考虑，就拒不接受，这就使他们的积极性受到影响。
    过去有的同志是在那里压服人，而不是说服人。例如说政治有问题，甚至戴上反动帽子。但是究竟问题有多大？严重到什么程度？对目前工作、工资、待遇的影响如何？有的同志的工作、工资、待遇确实不适当，这些同志的积极性发挥出来了没有？他们感到方向不明确，想向上级请愿。既然别的同志有这样意见，我听到了，就应该向党反映，所以今天在这里说一说，部里同志如果下去工作时可以进行细致了解，这样对提高党的威信，对发挥他们的积极性都有好处。
    李运墀说：父母教训孩子是为了爱孩子，党为什么不像这样的爱护干部呢？
    电力设计分院李运墀说：党在政治思想教育方面，除一般的政治学习外，其他政治思想工作很少。党委和其他领导干部没找我谈过。党委一打电话给我，我就知道要我写证明材料。当然写证明材料是需要的，但除此以外还应该有些别的。另外，解决思想问题的方法比较简单，实际容易形成用大帽子压人，不如经常从具体事情上关心爱护同志好。我常常想，为什么父母打孩子不会使父母在孩子中“丧失威信”，这就是因为父母平时关心他爱护他，偶尔打一次也不致影响相互间的感情。政治思想工作为什么不能像这样作呢？
    邓才寿说：不要压我们，也不要捧我们。
    北京水电设计院邓才寿说：领导同志对干部的批评帮助要恰当。过去鼓励青年积极性时助长了青年的骄傲情绪。批评老工程师的缺点时不要把这些同志原来已经很微弱的一点积极性也损伤掉。我们现在才四十多岁，我希望不要叫我们“老工程师”，我们还不老。三国时黄忠还不服老，叫我们老工程师就会使人过早地产生老的感觉。在外国， “老工程师”是光荣的称号，说明他有经验，得到大家的尊敬；而在中国则不然，在某些场合实际上是保守落后的代名词或者同义词。当然现在不同了，对老工程师都加以鼓励，但这些鼓励好像把人抛在空中一样。过去一压，现在一捧，弄得人糊里糊涂，一捧一压实在叫人受不了。老工程师不希望压，也不希望捧，只希望得到恰如其分的待遇。张金堂说：
  为什么工程师作的鉴定，没有党员签字就不算数。
    技术改进局工程师张金堂发言中提到三点：一、党员有义务向党反映情况，问题是有的情况反映错了，领导不加调查研究就轻信，使党外群众吃尽苦头。例如“三反”时，我曾提出要求领导上纠正右倾行动，结果党员反映成纠正“左”倾思想。当时正是反右倾的时候，因而使我吃了不少苦头。
    二、对党外群众不信任。例如云南烧坏了发电机，请了十个工程师去作鉴定，结论是技术操作上的错误，十个工程师都签了字，但十个人中没有一个是党员，因而领导上不相信这个鉴定，结果还是把运行人员逮捕了。
    三、有的同志说党外群众有职无权，我认为是无职无权。下边单位的领导人往往认为只有各级领导全都配备党员干部，才算加强党的领导。例如云南电业局的通讯科长是个党员，他才搞了二、三年通讯工作，他的师傅刚好也在他科里，双方感到很别扭，我们也觉得很别扭。找他谈问题得不到解决，因为他不懂。所以产生这样的问题，可能是因为党员有宝贵的品质——很服从，上边说什么就干什么，非党同志却往往会提出意见。我认为应该“量材而用”。
    郑肇基说：我请党员在家里喝一杯咖啡，也被批评是“太资产阶级化了”
    技术改进局工程师郑肇基说：有一次一位党员到我家去玩，我泡了一杯咖啡给他喝，我当时倒是很真诚的。可是一个星期以后，在一次小组会上，就因为这件事批评我太资产阶级化了。这真使人啼笑皆非。这样，非党员对党员就心存戒备，有一次一位领导同志到我的朋友家去玩，本来朋友的爱人在后门口杀鸡，可是吃饭时却没有吃到鸡，原因是怕人家批评有资产阶级思想。
    这两件事虽是笑话，但类似这样的事还很多。
    刚解放时，我们从未认为党员可怕，但是为什么相处这几年，还感到有墙呢？以上就是原因。如何把这墙推倒，很大一部分要靠党，特别是要靠党员领导同志；当然非党同志也要积极地毫无顾虑地反映情况，要有信心。总之要靠双方努力，光空叫不行。
    张景泰说：不要把知识分子当成呆滞器材
    生产司工程师张景泰说，旧知识分子不要求都做党员，但要求有适当的待遇。希望领导上不要把我们当作“呆滞器材”，到可以处理时才加以处理。去年成立技术改革局处理了一批，成立动力学院又处理一批。而且处理这些“呆滞器材”，还不看规范大小，往往把二百二十伏的用在二万伏上，二万五千伏的用在六千伏上。领导上对这些干部要深入了解一下看看规范，人虽没有名牌，但下了工夫是可以了解的。不要让十二吋的工字钢当了二吋角铁用，同时也不要让三吋角铁当十二吋工字钢用。
    这个会议还将继续举行。
