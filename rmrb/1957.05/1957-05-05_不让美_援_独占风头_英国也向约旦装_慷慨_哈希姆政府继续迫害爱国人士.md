Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Following the United States' announcement of military "aid" to Jordan, the British government is also adopting a bribery policy to support the pro-Western regime in Jordan.

The British Foreign Office issued a statement on May 2, stating that it agreed to Jordan's temporary suspension of the first installment of its debt repayment to Britain.

According to the agreement signed by Britain and Jordan on March 10 this year to abolish the 1948 Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, Jordan has to pay a total of 4.25 million pounds for the purchase of weapons and ammunition left by Britain and the payment for land and equipment left by the British. This money will be repaid in installments every May 1st. The first payment is 652,000 pounds.

At the same time, British public opinion continues to criticize the United States' military intervention in Jordan.

The "Tribune" weekly said that Dulles relies on naval strike forces to continue what Eden has not finished. Washington's purpose is "to keep this land within its sphere of influence."

"Tribune" accused the Eisenhower Doctrine of being "a typical commanding order, untenable in the face of international law, a direct violation of all the ideals of the United Nations, and a threat to world peace."

Labor MP Crossman published an article in the "Daily Mirror" saying that after Eisenhower hurriedly dispatched the Sixth Fleet to the eastern Mediterranean, Jordan banned all political parties and trade union activities, which shows the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Labor left-wing leader Bevan criticized the US Middle East policy and the British and French policies as being birds of a feather in a radio speech. He said: "In order to maintain peace, Western countries should study the Soviet Union's recent proposal for joint action in the Middle East."

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 4th: A Jordanian government spokesman said on the 3rd that the Hashemite cabinet is continuing arrests.

On the same day, Jordan's national military commander, Tuquan, announced that the two newly established military courts would begin trying recently arrested nationalist party members and other patriots on the 4th.

A United Press reporter said on the 3rd that a series of measures taken by Hussein recently, such as appointing a pro-Western cabinet, dissolving political parties, and suppressing organized labor, "shows that King Hussein is determined to complete a cleansing process in all departments of political and official life."

Another measure taken by the Jordanian authorities is that its relations with Iraq, a member of the Baghdad Pact, have become closer recently. Jordan's Hashemite Radio spent an hour on May 2 celebrating the twenty-second birthday of Iraqi King Faisal II. This practice was unprecedented.

### 不让美“援”独占风头  英国也向约旦装“慷慨”  哈希姆政府继续迫害爱国人士

    不让美“援”独占风头
    英国也向约旦装“慷慨”
    哈希姆政府继续迫害爱国人士
    本报综合报道　随着美国宣布给予约旦以军事“援助”之后，英国政府也采取贿买政策，来支持约旦的亲西方政权。
    英国外交部5月2日发表声明，表示同意约旦暂时停止支付约旦所欠英国债款中第一次应偿还的款项。
    根据今年3月10日英约签署的废除1948年英约条约的协定，约旦由于购买英国遗留下来的武器弹药以及偿付英国人留下的土地和设备，一共要付款四百二十五万英镑。这笔钱分期在每年5月1日偿还一次。第一次是六十五万二千英镑。
    与此同时，英国舆论界继续抨击美国对约旦的军事干涉。
    “论坛”周报说，杜勒斯依靠海军打击力量想把艾登未做完的事情继续做下去。华盛顿的目的就是“要把这块土地保持在势力范围以内”。
    “论坛”指责艾森豪威尔主义是“典型的发号施令，在国际法面前站不住脚，是直接违反联合国的一切理想的，是对世界和平的威胁。”
    工党议员克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”上发表文章说，在艾森豪威尔赶忙派遣第六舰队到东地中海以后，约旦就禁止了一切政党和工会的活动，这就说明了“艾森豪威尔主义”的实质。
    工党左翼领袖比万在广播演说中批评美国的中东政策和英法政策是一丘之貉。他说：“为了维护和平，西方国家应当研究俄国人不久前提出的关于在中东采取共同行动的建议。”
    据新华社4日讯　安曼消息：约旦政府发言人3日说，哈希姆内阁还在继续进行逮捕。
    同一天，约旦全国军事长官图康宣布最近设立的两个军事法庭要在4日开始审讯最近被捕的民族主义党派人士和其他爱国人士。
    合众社记者3日说，侯赛因最近所采取的任命亲西方的内阁、解散政党、镇压有组织的劳工等一系列措施，“表明侯赛因国王决心要在政治和官方生活的一切部门中完成一个清洗的过程”。
    约旦当局的另一措施是最近以来它同巴格达条约国家伊拉克的关系正更加密切。约旦的哈希姆电台在5月2日以一小时的时间来庆祝伊拉克国王费萨尔二世的二十二岁生日。这种做法是以前不曾有过的。
