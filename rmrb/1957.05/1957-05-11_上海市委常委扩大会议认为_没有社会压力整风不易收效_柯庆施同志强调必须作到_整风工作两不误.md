This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch from the 10th: “The criticisms from society play an important role in promoting the development of our Party's rectification movement. Without social pressure, rectification is unlikely to be effective.” This was said by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee today. He said: The rectification movement in Shanghai is currently proceeding from two aspects. On the one hand, we continue to study documents in depth, and on the other hand, each unit holds symposiums with non-Party members to widely listen to their criticisms and opinions. Because the situations of each unit are different, and the specific contradictions that exist are also different, it is necessary to expose contradictions through extensive discussions and criticisms, and then find the main contradictions existing in the unit to solve them in the rectification.

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has held fourteen symposiums with people from all walks of life since the 18th of last month, and various departments have also held some symposiums with non-Party members separately. Recently, the preparatory meeting of the Fourth Session of the First Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has also held many group meetings in succession. At these meetings, people have put forward many sharp and pertinent opinions on the current contradictions among the people and on the work of the Party. Ke Qingshi said that many of the opinions touch on some fundamental issues in our work and deserve our deep research.

This year's rectification in Shanghai will be carried out in accordance with the method of "studying, examining, correcting, and handling simultaneously." The purpose is to thoroughly understand the problems, truly draw some profound lessons, and find some solutions. After many symposiums with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, many contradictions in the work have been revealed. Among them, some problems that should be solved and can be solved, we need to immediately organize forces to solve them. If we do not seize the time to examine and improve simultaneously, it will affect the development of the movement. This is a characteristic of this year's rectification movement in Shanghai.

Ke Qingshi said: In this year's rectification, it is imperative to grasp the point of "no disruption of rectification and work." In the past, rectification could be carried out by stopping work, but this year it cannot be carried out behind closed doors.

    上海市委常委扩大会议认为
    没有社会压力整风不易收效
    柯庆施同志强调必须作到“整风工作两不误”
    本报上海10日电“社会上的批评，对推动我们党的整风运动的开展有重要作用，没有社会的压力，整风不易收效。”这是上海市委第一书记柯庆施，在今天一次常委扩大会议上说的。他说：上海市的整风运动，目前正在从两方面入手。一方面继续深入学习文件，一方面由各单位分别召开党外人士的座谈会，广泛地听取他们的批评和意见。因为各个单位的情况不同，存在的具体矛盾也不同，因此必须通过广泛的讨论和批评，才能暴露矛盾，然后找出本单位所存在的主要矛盾，在整风中来加以解决。
    上海市委从上月18日起曾召开了十四次各界座谈会，各个部门也曾分别召开了一些党外人士座谈会。最近，上海市政协一届四次会议的预备会议，又连续召开了多次小组会，在这些会上，人们对当前人民内部矛盾，对党的工作，提出了许多尖锐、中肯的意见。柯庆施说，人们有好些意见，触及到了我们工作中带有根本性的一些问题，值得我们加以深刻的研究。
    上海今年的整风将按照“边学习、边检查、边改正、边处理”的办法进行，目的是把问题搞透，搞彻底，真正得出一些深刻的教训，找出一些解决问题的办法。上海经过多次的各界座谈以后，工作中的许多矛盾已揭露出来，其中有些应当解决和可能解决的问题，我们需要立即组织力量去解决，如果不抓紧来边检查、边改进，就会影响到运动的开展。这是今年上海整风运动的一个特点。
    柯庆施说：今年的整风中，“整风与工作两不误”这一点一定要掌握好。过去整风可以停止工作来整，但今年不能关着门来整。
