    Strange Method of Driving Away Wild Animals
    West German scientist Hildebrandt is manufacturing one of the world's most peculiar commodities—animal repellent scents. After years of research, he has created over one hundred and fifty artificial and natural scents, ranging from the fragrance of cherry blossoms to the particularly strong scent of lions.
    So far, customers ordering various scents to drive away wild animals have spread throughout Europe, America, and Africa. For example, Kenya's national parks are using his human body odor and floral scents to drive away elephants, a Scottish landowner is using a special scent he made to curb porcupines that harass the fields, and Sweden is also using "human oil" to stop moose.

    驱逐野兽的奇法
    西德科学家希尔德布兰特正在制造世界上最奇特的商品之一——驱逐兽类的气味。他经过了多年的研究，已经制造了一百五十多种人造的和天然的气味，从樱花的香气到特别强烈的狮子的气味，应有尽有。
    到目前为止，订购各种各样的气味以驱逐野兽的顾客，已经遍及欧、美、非三洲。例如怯尼亚的国家公园在用他制的人体气味和花香驱逐大象，苏格兰一个地主在用他制的一种特别气味遏制骚扰田地的豪猪，瑞典也用“人油”来制止麋鹿。
