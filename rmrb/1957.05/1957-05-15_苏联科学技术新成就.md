New Scientific and Technological Achievements of the Soviet Union

    Atomic-Powered Ships
    The Leningrad Shipyard is building an atomic-powered icebreaker. Since the Soviet Union can build atomic-powered icebreakers, it can naturally build atomic-powered ships. Soviet scientific institutions are studying whether it is worthwhile. According to the Institute of General Transport Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, atomic-powered ships are more economical than ordinary ships. It is very cost-effective to equip 10,000 to 12,000-ton ships and 25,000 to 30,000-ton tankers with atomic reactors. The transportation cost of such tankers can be reduced by 42% because no oil is needed. The speed of such ships can be increased by 20% because there is no need to store coal or water. Only the cost of atomic reactors and nuclear fuel is difficult to determine, as they are changing rapidly.

    Larger Jet Airliners
    "Tu-104" jet airliners go east or west every day at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport. The fifty seats are often in short supply. A larger "Tu-104" is about to be produced, with half again as many seats as the current one. A group of designers led by Tupolev is designing a four-engine aircraft that can carry one hundred seventy or eighty people. Its speed is about twenty times faster than a train.

  Using Radioactive Isotopes for Coal Mining
    The Soviet industry is increasingly using radioactive rays. The Coal Science Research Institute in Moscow has recently created some of these instruments. They can automatically regulate and check production processes at a distance. For example, radioactive isotopes are used to check the coal transportation situation in underground coal cars. When the coal car is full of coal, the ray sends a signal to the corresponding device, causing the coal car to automatically transport and unload. This research institute is creating a ray-operated coal mining machine. Radioactive isotopes can guide the coal mining machine, allowing it to mine only coal seams while avoiding rock layers. (Li)

    苏联科学技术新成就
    原子能轮船
    列宁格勒造船厂正在制造原子能破冰船。苏联既然能制造原子能破冰船，自然也能制造原子能轮船。苏联科学机关正在研究它是否合算。据苏联科学院总体运输问题研究所估计：原子能轮船要比普通轮船经济。一万到一万二千吨轮船和二万五千吨到三万吨油船，装配原子反应堆是很合算的。这种油船的运输成本可以降低42％，因为不用花油。这种轮船的速度可以提高20％，因为不用贮煤贮水。只是原子反应堆和核子燃料的成本难以确定，因为它们在日新月异地变化。
    更大的喷气式客机
    莫斯科伏努科夫飞机场上每天都有“图——104喷气客机东去或西去。五十个座位常常供不应求。即将出产大型的“图——104”，比现在的座位多半倍。在图波列夫领导下的一批设计师在设计一种能乘一百七八十人的四引擎飞机。它的速度比火车快约二十倍。
  用放射性同位素采煤
    苏联工业日益广泛地利用放射性射线。莫斯科的煤炭科学研究所最近创造了一些这类仪器。它们可以自动调节和检查远距离的生产过程。比如用放射性同位素检查地下煤车运煤的情形。当煤车装满煤的时候，射线就向相应的装置发出信号，使煤车自动地运卸。这个研究所在创造一种用射线操纵的采煤机。放射性同位素能向采煤机指引道路，使它只采煤层而避开岩层。（李）
