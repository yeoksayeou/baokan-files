Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th - Since the beginning of April, Shenyang land management departments have inspected the wasteful use of land by various capital construction units based on the opinions of farmers. They have also mobilized units with surplus land to voluntarily return or periodically release excess land for farmers to cultivate, depending on whether it is not needed this spring, not needed this year, or not needed at all in the future.

During this inspection, Shenyang land management departments discovered that many units were wasting land by over-appropriating or taking land without using it. Although more than 2,000 mu of arable land have been recovered so far, some units are still reluctant to hand over the land they have over-occupied, citing "key projects" and "special needs." For example, one factory has more than 3,400 mu of surplus land. However, they used the excuse of improving the lives of their employees to demarcate more than 400 mu of the best arable land for employees' families to engage in sideline production; the other 3,000 mu of arable land were left barren under the pretext of the factory's needs. If calculated at 400 jin of coarse grain per mu per year, this land could produce 1.2 million jin of grain annually. Units such as Northeast Institute of Technology, Shenyang Water Conservancy School, and Shenyang Sports School all over-occupied arable land, emphasizing modern standards and beautifying the campus. Shenyang No. 2 Middle School occupies an area of 100,000 square meters due to the unreasonable layout of its buildings, which is enough to build three middle schools of equal size.

    把多占的土地退出来！
    新华社沈阳8日电  沈阳土地主管部门根据农民的意见，从4月初起，先后检查了各基本建设单位使用土地的浪费现象，并且动员有多余土地的单位，根据今春不用、今年不用、今后完全不用等不同情况，主动地退出或定期让出多余土地，给农民耕种。
    沈阳土地主管部门在这次检查中，发现不少单位在使用土地上，有宽打窄用或征而不用的浪费现象。目前虽已收回了两千多亩耕地，但还有些单位借口“重点工程”、“特殊需要”，不愿交出多占的土地。例如：有一个工厂多余三千四百余亩土地。但他们借口改善职工生活，把其中最好的四百多亩耕地，圈定给职工家属搞副业；另外三千亩耕地，便借口工厂需要，任其荒芜。如果按每亩年产粗粮四百斤计算，这些土地每年可以产粮一百二十万斤。东北工学院、沈阳水利学校、沈阳体育学校等单位，强调现代标准、美化校园，都过多地占用了耕地。沈阳市立第二中学由于建筑物配置得不合理，用地面积达十万平方公尺，足够建设三个规模相等的中学。
