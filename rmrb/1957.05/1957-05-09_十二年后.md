    Twelve Years Later
    Czechoslovakia  Prouza
    This is a beautiful and terrifying spring twelve years ago, a spring that can never be erased from our memories.
    This spring is beautiful because everywhere in our country are apple trees in full bloom, and everywhere are fragrant lilacs; it is because we have restarted our vigorous life, and the children can play carefree in the sand again. The happiness that nature brings to people has returned to our side like a guest we have been waiting for eagerly for a long time. This is a beautiful spring, because after the long years of darkness and oppression, bloodshed and terror, a real spring, a spring of freedom, has finally arrived.
    At the same time, as we traveled west from Kosice (a city near the Soviet Union where the united government of the Czechoslovak National Front was established in April 1945 - translator's note) towards Prague, we saw terrifying scenes: burned villages, destroyed railways, blown-up bridges, and blocked tunnels. Houses without roofs, children who had lost their parents, eyes that could no longer cry, and lips that had forgotten how to smile. The dark, ravaged, and scarred earth, and the deep wounds in people's hearts.
    This was a beautiful and terrifying spring twelve years ago. At that time, people all over the world had a common idea: "After we defeat the fascist bandits, we must declare to everyone - there must be no more war!"
    The fruits of hatred are terrifying and chilling, but the imagination and courage of those who stood on the ruins empty-handed are endless. Their hearts were full of youthful enthusiasm and fervor, and they began to erect scaffolding for new buildings. The enemy burned the bridges in the retreating areas. In fact, all the bridges were burned at that time, so that we could not return. Baraz and Lidice (Hitler fascists had completely destroyed the houses and residents of this village. It has been rebuilt after the war. Roses from various countries have been planted here - translator's note) were burned down. The enemy attempted to erase them from the map permanently. But new, more beautiful Baraz and Lidice have grown up again. Now, more gorgeous roses, cultivated by the love and kindness of all mankind, are blooming here again. Twelve years ago, the fire burned down the clock tower in Prague's Staroměstské Square. When we heard the news, we covered our faces with our hands, so that no one could see our tears. But now, the beautiful and ancient clock tower stands in its original place again. This city on the Vltava River - the heart of Czechoslovakia - has become the proud and invincible heart of our country again. Prague's life is our life. Our peaceful land has its own gentle and beautiful face again, a face made wiser by history and experience. Just like twelve years ago, our motherland bravely issued the same words, the same oath in advance: "There must be no more war!"
    If saying that beauty and happiness have returned to our homeland is not enough. To say that our lives have been more beautiful and happier in these twelve years, to say that our people have received a gift from history, to say that victory fell from the sky - these are all too easy to say. We must see the whole truth. It must be pointed out that our people have never received anything effortlessly from anyone. Yes, these years have been years of enthusiasm and construction, but also difficult and often very painful years. We must defend the freedom won at a great price from foreign occupiers and prevent those who spread discord and hatred in our ranks from infringing upon it. Our people victoriously passed this historical test in 1948 without bloodshed or retreat. Then and later, the people did not retreat in the face of obstacles, nor did they compromise with shortcomings. Everything they own is the fruit and spoils of their labor. Beauty and joy, new dams and factories, the roofs over the heads of children, the wish for the peaceful tranquility of "silent night" that accompanies children to sleep - all of this was won by the people themselves.
    Our country is richer and more beautiful. "At first glance, this is paradise on earth..." The Czech poet Josef Kajetán Tyl once sang of his homeland. When Smetana saw the clear and bright water of the Vltava River, how would he write? What would he add to "My Country"? Do you know that place, where the Svatá Jana River is noisy? Of course, you know it. It is one of the most beautiful melodies, like tapping the keys of the soul from the Czech land, the deepest part of its history, its pure heart. It is precisely there, in the Svatá Jana basin, on the Vltava River, that the magnificent buildings built by the Czech people stand. This is the Slapy lock. This is not the only one. A series of new magnificent buildings are rising on the Vltava River. Is it prose or poetry? No, it is poetry, and only poetry. The ancient river praised by poets and singers, today's poem is beauty and happiness for all the people of this country. And such examples, such poetic material, we can also find many in Ostrava without rivers, where the steel Končice (the location of the Gottwald Steel Plant - translator's note) stands like a mountain; the same is true in the Oder River and anywhere else, where it is all "paradise on earth...".
    Even more extensive changes have taken place on the map of Slovakia. The fantasy of a country of iron wire peddlers and outlaws, the fantasy of a country full of small thatched huts (where hunger makes life even more terrible), the fantasy of a country full of prisons, police, and whips, has become a reality. Industrialization has given our country bread and poetry. If the boatmen were now sailing down the surging Váh River, and with them was the poet - Janko Kráľ, how loud his singing would be! Today's Váh River Valley is the border area of ​​hydropower stations. Today, which small city on the Váh River does not have a factory? Even the villages near the Váh River have embarked on the road of industrial revolution. Hungry people no longer have to look for bread everywhere, people have gone to work in many new factories. The great poet Hviezdoslav once roamed in Bábice. Now his beautiful poem "Orava - Oravienky" has not lost its beauty and magic, it has only lost its poverty. The Orava Dam, the water of the Orava Reservoir, has submerged many centuries of poverty and humiliation of the poor people of Orava. This is a poem on the great and beautiful map of the new Slovakia. There is also the new steel plant in Istebné, the new factory in Dolná Orava, which produces 100,000 television sets every year - all of this is also poetry...
    And what is the most exciting thing in our country's prosperity and development? That is, the center of all our efforts is for people. Our people have become truly new, proud people. They were once oppressed, bent-over paupers and humiliated people. Now they have straightened their chests and raised their eyebrows. No one can take these achievements from their hands. Their living standards and cultural needs are improving, which is one of the signs of our motherland's development. You know, in the past year, the average citizen in our country has seen a play once and a movie fifteen times. In Czechoslovakia, there is now an average of one radio for every four people. Our country publishes fifteen new books every day, and every citizen can get an average of three books and seventy-five newspapers every year.
    Some say that numbers are a dry language. However, these facts are not dry numbers, they are a vivid and amazing reality, the achievements of the Czechoslovak working people's efforts for the great goal, the reality of the new life - socialist life. It is enough to compare it with the past: last year's growth in Czechoslovakia's industrial production was equal to a quarter of the country's total production before the war. For example, electricity production has tripled compared to before the war. The country's annual industrial output is about 2.7 times that of the pre-war period, while industrial production in the Slovak region is equal to six times that of the pre-war period. Needless to emphasize, our country has become an important factor in international trade, we have no unemployed, but on the contrary feel a shortage of labor, because we are building more and more factories every year. All of these are also reflected in the domestic market, reflected in the satisfaction of increasingly improving living needs, reflected in the improvement of living conditions and the increase in residents' purchasing power. At the same time, this is mainly manifested in the satisfaction of our residents, in the people's confidence in the path they have chosen, and in their confidence in the future.
    Twelve years have passed. These have been difficult and beautiful years, with many traps, obstacles, and mistakes; but also many victories, many warmths, and the fruits of labor.
    The beautiful country, the country of Smetana and Comenius, the country of Hviezdoslav and Janko Kráľ, is facing its spring again. Apple trees are growing luxuriantly with flowers and leaves, the sun is shining high in the sky, children are playing innocently in the sand, and wisps of clouds are slowly floating over our land. Since the victorious red flag was raised on the Reichstag in Berlin, after the remaining enemies had to raise the white flag of surrender in our country, peace has returned to our land again. The first slogan of our daily work is: "Never again war!" But if dark clouds appear in the clear sky again, if the invaders want to rush into our forests and fields again, if they want to trample on our "paradise on earth" again, then the same faces will solemnly raise their eyebrows, the same eyes will show firm determination, and the same hands will clench their fists tightly!

    十二年后
    捷克斯洛伐克  普罗哈兹卡
    这是十二年前的一个美丽而又恐怖的春天，这个春天在我们的记忆里是永远不能磨灭的。
    这个春天之所以美丽，是因为在我们的国土上，处处都是繁花盛开的苹果树，处处都是芬芳馥郁的丁香花；是因为我们重新开始了蓬勃的生活，孩子们又可以无忧无虑地在沙地上嬉戏了，大自然给人们带来的幸福，就像一位我们长久地急切等待的客人一样，回到了我们的身边。这是一个美丽的春天，因为在长期的黑暗和压迫、流血和恐怖的岁月以后，真正的春天，自由的春天又降临了。
    同时，当我们从科息斯（这是靠近苏联的一个城市，1945年4月在这里成立了捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的联合政府——译注）向西行，向布拉格去的道路上，我们看到了恐怖的景象：被焚烧的村庄，被破坏的铁路，被炸毁的桥梁，被堵塞的隧道。没有屋顶的房屋，失去了父母的孩子，已经不会哭的眼睛和忘记了笑的嘴唇。黑黝黝的、被蹂躏的、遍体鳞伤的大地，还有人们内心深处的创伤。
    这是十二年前的一个美丽而又恐怖的春天。当时，全世界的人民都有这样一个共同的想法：“当我们打败了法西斯匪徒以后，我们要向所有的人宣称——决不许再有战争！”
    仇恨的果实是令人恐怖和战栗的，但是，那些站在废墟上赤手空拳的人们的幻想和勇气却是无穷无尽的。他们心中充满着青年的奋激和热情，他们开始为新的建筑搭起手脚架。敌人烧毁了撤退地区的桥梁，实际上，所有的桥梁当时都被烧毁了，为了使我们不能回来。巴拉日和利迪斯村（希特勒法西斯曾把这个村子的房屋和居民整个毁灭，战后已重建起来。在这里栽种了从各国送来的玫瑰花——译注）都被焚毁了，敌人企图永久把它们从地图上抹掉。可是新的、更美丽的巴拉日和利迪斯又成长起来了。现在，被全人类的爱和善良的心栽培起来的、更加艳丽的玫瑰花，又在这里盛开了。十二年前，大火烧毁了布拉格斯塔罗米斯广场的钟楼，当听到了这个消息的时候，我们都用手蒙住脸，为了不让任何人看见我们的眼泪。可是现在，美丽而古老的钟楼又在原来的地方耸立起来了。这个弗尔塔瓦河上的城市——捷克斯洛伐克的心脏，又成为我们全国骄傲的、不可征服的心脏了。布拉格的生命就是我们的生命。我们的和平的土地又有了自己的温柔美丽的面貌，历史和经验使之变得更加聪慧的面貌。就像十二年前一样，我们的祖国勇敢地预先发出了同样的话，同样的誓言：“决不许再有战争！”
    如果说美丽和快乐又回到了我们的故乡，那是不够的。说这十二年中我们的生活是更美丽更快乐了，说我们人民得到了历史的赠礼，说胜利自天而降，——这都说得太轻易了。应当看到全部真相。必须指出，我们人民从来没有从任何人那里毫不费力地得到任何东西。是的，这些年是热情和建设的年代，但同时也是艰难的、而且往往是非常痛苦的年代。必须保卫用巨大代价从外国占领者手中争到的自由，并且不让那些在自己队伍中散布不和和仇恨的人侵犯它。我国人民在1948年胜利地通过了这种历史考验，既没有流血，也没有退让。那时和以后，人民没有在障碍面前退却，没有向缺点妥协。他们拥有的一切，都是他们的劳动果实和战利品。美丽和欢乐，新的堤坝和工厂，孩子们头上的屋顶，伴着孩子们安睡的那种“静静的夜”的和平安宁的愿望——这一切都是人民自己争来的。
    我们的国家更富裕和更美丽了。“一眼看来，这就是地上的乐园……”捷克诗人约瑟夫·卡耶当·代尔曾这样歌颂自己的祖国。当斯麦塔纳看见弗尔塔瓦河的澄碧明澈的河水的时候，他会怎样写呢，他会给“我的祖国”加添些什么呢？你知道那个地方吗，那个斯瓦托扬河喧闹的地方？当然，你是知道的。它是最优美的曲调之一，犹如敲着来自捷克大地的灵魂、它历史的最深处、它纯洁的心灵的音键。正是在那里，在斯瓦托扬流域，在弗尔塔瓦河上，耸立着由捷克人建设起来的宏伟的建筑。这是斯拉普水闸。这不是唯一的。在弗尔塔瓦河上，正在兴起一连串的新的宏伟的建筑物。是散文呢还是诗？不，是诗，而且只是诗。诗人和歌手颂赞的古老的河流，今天的诗篇，对这个国家所有的人说来，都是美丽和幸福的。而这样的例子、这样的诗材，我们在没有河流的俄斯特拉发也能找到很多，那里山峰一样耸立着钢铁的孔奇查（哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂的所在地——译注）；在奥得河以及随便什么地方也是这样，那里都是“地上的乐园……”。
    在斯洛伐克的地图上发生了更加广泛的变化。贩卖铁丝的商人和亡命徒的国家的幻想，触目皆是矮小的茅屋（在这里饥饿使生活变得更加可怕）的国家的幻想，满布监房、警察和鞭子的国家的幻想，已经成了现实。工业化使我们国家有了面包和诗歌。假如船夫们现在沿着波浪汹涌的发格河驶船而下的话，而且和他们一起的有诗人——扬科·科拉里，那么他的歌声又会多么地响亮啊！今天的发格河的溪谷，这是水电站的边区。今天，在发格河上的哪个小城市没有工厂呢？就是在发格河附近的村庄也走上了工业革命的道路。饥饿的人们已用不着到处寻找面包，人们已走进许许多多的新工厂里去做工了。从前伟大的诗人格维兹多斯拉夫曾在巴比城流浪。现在他的美丽的诗篇“奥拉瓦—奥拉文基”并没有失去它的美和魔力，它失去的只是它的贫穷。奥拉瓦堤坝、奥拉瓦水库的水，淹没了奥拉瓦穷人的许多世纪的贫困和屈辱。这是新的斯洛伐克伟大而美丽的地图上的诗篇。还有伊斯特布纳的新钢铁厂，下奥拉瓦的新工厂，它每年出产十万架电视机——所有这一切也都是诗……。
    而什么又是我国繁荣发展中最令人兴奋的事情呢？这就是，我们一切努力的中心都是为了人。我国人民已经成为真正新的、自豪的人。他们过去曾经是被压迫者，弯腰曲背的贫民和屈辱的人们。现在他们已经挺起胸膛，扬眉吐气了。没有人能从他们的手中夺走这些成果。他们的生活水平和文化需要正在提高，这也就是我们祖国发展的标志之一。要知道，在过去一年里，我国平均每一个公民都看过一次戏和十五次电影。在捷克斯洛伐克，现在平均每四个人就有一架收音机。我国平均每一天要出版十五本新书，每一个公民每年平均可以分到三本书和七十五份报纸。
    有人说，数字是枯燥的语言。但是，这些事实并不是枯燥的数字，这是生动的惊人的现实，这是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民为伟大目标而努力所获得的成果，这是新的生活——社会主义生活的现实。只要同过去作一番比较就够了：去年捷克斯洛伐克工业生产的增长额，等于战前全国生产总额的四分之一。再例如，电力生产比战前增加了三倍。全国工业年产量约等于战前的二点七倍，而斯洛伐克地区的工业生产则等于战前的六倍。用不着强调指出，我国已成为国际贸易中的一个重要因素，我们已经没有失业者，而相反地感到劳动力不足，因为我们每年都要建设越来越多的工厂。所有这些也都反映在国内市场上，反映在日益提高的生活需要的满足上，反映在生活条件的改善和居民购买力的提高上。同时，这也主要表现在我国居民的满意上，表现在人民对于自己所选择的道路的信心上，对于未来的信心上。
    十二年过去了。这是些艰难而美好的年份，有过许多陷井，障碍，错误；但也有很多的胜利，许多的温暖和工作的成果。
    美丽的国家，斯麦塔纳和考门斯基的国家，格维兹多斯拉夫和扬科·科拉里的国家重新面对着自己的春天。苹果树在花叶繁茂地生长着，太阳在天空高高地照耀着，孩子们天真烂漫地在沙地上嬉戏，霭霭的云在我们国土的上空缓缓飘浮。自从在柏林的国会大厦上竖起了胜利的红旗以来，当残余的敌人不得不在我国扯起白色的降旗以后，和平重又降临到我们的国土上。我们进行日常劳动的第一句口号就是：“再也不要战争！”但是，如果晴空里再度出现阴云，如果侵略者再要冲进我们的森林和原野，如果他们再想来蹂躏我们的“地上的乐园”，那么，同样的那些脸会严肃地竖起双眉，同样的那些眼睛里可以看到坚定的决心，同样的那些手会紧握起自己的拳头！
