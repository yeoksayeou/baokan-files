Starting with Inspecting the Ideological Style of Leading Cadres
Provincial Party Committees of Eight Provinces Including Jiangxi and Shandong Determine Rectification Steps

(Our Newspaper Combined Dispatch) The Provincial Party Committees of Jiangxi, Shandong, Qinghai, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Henan held meetings separately, deciding to immediately begin rectification and researching the steps for rectification, starting first with inspecting the ideological style of leading organs.

In the aforementioned meetings of the eight provincial party committees, most first inspected the learning situation regarding the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and analyzed the ideological style of cadres. It was generally believed that since studying Chairman Mao's speech, leading organs at all levels and the broad masses of cadres had begun to see the manifestations of contradictions among the people in all aspects, recognizing that only by resolutely opposing bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism could contradictions among the people be correctly handled.

Rectification Steps: Tiered and Phased, Conducted in Order

Regarding the rectification steps, each province decided to conduct it in a tiered and phased manner. Jiangxi, Shanxi, Zhejiang, and Heilongjiang decided to conduct it in three phases. Qinghai and Liaoning divided it into two phases, the first phase starting with the provincial party committee or the provincial, municipal, and prefectural party committees. Shandong and Henan decided to unfold it in a tiered and orderly manner. Regarding the rectification time, Qinghai, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Shandong all required that the rectification above the county level be completed within this year. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee also put forward some preliminary principles and requirements for carrying out the rectification movement. First, it demanded that the rectification movement be launched immediately, emphasizing learning, rectifying, correcting, and working simultaneously. Second, it demanded that the rectification movement be carried out from top to bottom, divided into three steps: first step, the provincial and prefectural/municipal party committees; second step, the counties and districts; third step, the townships. In this way, the movement can be carried out step-by-step, prepared, and orderly. Changes in the bureaucratism of leading organs and leading cadres and the acquisition of certain rectification experiences will be beneficial to the rectification movement in counties, districts, and townships. Third, rectification must be closely integrated with current work, requiring that neither rectification nor work should be neglected. Fourth, the learning steps can be roughly divided into three stages: the first stage is to study documents, the second stage is to inspect work, ideology, and style, and the third stage is to establish a rational system and comprehensively improve work. Fifth, for the rectification movement of township cadres, currently, a county can conduct two pilot points to create experience for universal rectification. Sixth, the rectification time is tentatively set at six months. The province and prefecture/municipality will start from now until the end of October, a total of six months, to complete the rectification. The rectification time for counties, districts, and townships is not yet determined.

Learning, Inspecting, and Improving Simultaneously

Based on the current work situation, each province determined the principles and methods of this rectification movement. The Henan Provincial Party Committee emphasized the principle that rectification and work should not be neglected, and at the same time required that this rectification movement must adopt the policy of learning, inspecting, and improving simultaneously. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee required that on the one hand, ideological understanding should be improved through studying documents; on the other hand, problems in practical work should be studied and resolved, and the main contradictions among the people should be correctly handled, thereby promoting the current movement to increase production and practice economy, the movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production, and various tasks. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee required that the rectification and work time should be arranged well, requiring leading personnel to have time to study and be able to go deep down, both to rectify style and to improve current work. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee required that each department stagger the rectification time and the personnel participating, so that there are people working and producing, and people rectifying, every day.

Regarding the leadership of the rectification movement, Shandong, Qinghai, Liaoning, Henan, Heilongjiang, and Jiangxi have all established rectification leading groups.

    从检查领导干部思想作风开始
    江西、山东等八省省委确定整风步骤
    本报综合稿　江西、山东、青海、山西、浙江、黑龙江、辽宁、河南八省省委分别举行会议，决定立即开始整风，并研究了整风的步骤，首先从检查领导机关的思想作风开始。
    在上述八省省委会议中，大都首先检查了关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的学习情况，并分析了干部的思想作风。一般认为，自从学习了毛主席的讲话以来，各级领导机关和广大干部已经开始看到人民内部矛盾在各方面的表现，认识到只有坚决反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，才能正确处理人民内部矛盾。
    整风步骤  分级分批  依序进行
    关于整风步骤，各省都决定分级分批进行。江西、山西、浙江、黑龙江决定分为三批进行。青海、辽宁分为二批进行，第一批都是从省委或省、市、地委开始。山东、河南决定分级依序展开。整风时间，青海、辽宁、江西、山东县以上的整风都要求在今年以内结束。江西省委对开展整风运动并提出了一些初步原则和要求。第一、要求整风运动立即开展起来，强调边学、边整、边改、边作。第二、要求自上而下地开展整风运动，分为三步走：第一步省和地、市委；第二步县和区；第三步乡。这样，可使运动有步骤、有准备、有次序地逐步开展起来。领导机关和领导干部的官僚主义有所改变和取得一定的整风经验，有利于县、区和乡的整风运动。第三、整风与当前工作必须密切结合，要求整风与工作两不误。第四、学习步骤大体上可规定三个阶段，第一阶段学习文件，第二阶段检查工作、思想和作风，第三阶段建立合理的制度，全面改进工作。第五、乡干部的整风运动，目前，一个县可搞两个点，为普遍进行整风创造经验。第六、整风时间，初步确定六个月。省和地、市从现在开始到10月底，共六个月的时间结束整风。县区和乡的整风时间暂不确定。
    边学习  边检查  边改进
    根据当前工作情况，各省确定了这次整风运动的原则和方法。河南省委强调整风和工作两不误的原则，同时要求这次整风运动必须采取边学习、边检查、边改进的方针。山西省委要求一面通过学习文件，提高思想认识；一面研究和解决实际工作中的问题，正确地处理人民内部的主要矛盾，从而推动当前的增产节约运动、争取农业生产大丰收运动和各项工作。辽宁省委要求把整风和工作时间安排好，要求领导人员既有时间学习又能深入下去，既可整顿作风又能改进当前工作。黑龙江省委要求各部门把整风时间和参加的人员都交错开来，做到每天都有人在工作、生产，有人在整风。
    关于整风运动的领导，山东、青海、辽宁、河南、黑龙江、江西都成立了整风领导小组。
