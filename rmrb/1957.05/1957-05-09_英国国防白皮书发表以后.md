After the British government published this year's Defence White Paper, Western newspapers and periodicals have made many comments over the past month. Judging from the reactions of all parties, this white paper has caused no small shock in Western countries, especially the United States. The American "New York Times" said that it has presented the United States with the "most difficult" problem since the war. At the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, one of the main tasks of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles was to prevent the U.S.'s Western European allies from following Britain's example.

Why has this annual Defence White Paper, which is usually published, caused such a big shock in the United States this year?

Seeking to Reduce Military Spending

The British Defence White Paper for this year puts forward a five-year plan containing some new guidelines. Its main contents are: to reduce the total number of troops by nearly half within five years, and gradually withdraw overseas troops from certain areas; to gradually nuclearize the three services, and give priority to the research and manufacture of nuclear weapons in terms of arms production. However, for a considerable period in the future, it will rely on the United States for the supply of medium-range and long-range missiles.

There are two reasons why Britain has adopted this new policy of shrinking its total military force and concentrating its efforts on the nuclear arms race.

The most important reason is that Britain's economic strength can hardly continue to support such a heavy military burden as in the past.

Britain was active in the arms race that was instigated by the United States after the outbreak of the Korean War. Over the past five years, Britain has spent a total of more than 7 billion pounds on arms expansion and war preparation. Among the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Britain's military burden exceeds that of all other member states except the United States.

Over the past five years, defense expenditures have consumed an average of 10% of the gross national product and 7% of the labor force, and have consumed one-eighth of the metal processing industry's production capacity.

Such a heavy burden has caused serious adverse consequences to the British economy. It has weakened the competitiveness of British exports, making Britain's position in the capitalist world market unfavorable; it has limited the amount of overseas investment urgently needed by Britain to prevent the disintegration of its colonial empire, making its investment in the empire dangerously lagging behind the United States in recent years; it has also increased difficulties in international payments, making the pound's position more unstable and threatening the pound's credibility as a major international means of payment. Even British authorities have had to admit that huge military spending is a fatal wound to the British economy.

Similarly, in terms of arms expansion and war preparation, maintaining a large number of conventional troops and keeping them modernized, while at the same time fully developing nuclear weapons, is also something that Britain cannot afford. According to British Defense Minister Sandys, due to the high cost of new weapons, if the current size of the army is maintained, the annual military expenditure will need 1.7 billion pounds.

Therefore, Britain has to make a choice between economic bankruptcy and some contraction of military spending. The white paper shows that Britain has taken the latter path, gradually reducing conventional military equipment in order to concentrate its efforts on the nuclearization of the three services.

Attempting to Maintain Great Power Status

After the end of World War II, Britain actively colluded with the United States, taking a policy of encirclement and preparing for a new war against socialist countries in the military field. At the same time, Britain also mobilized many forces to try its best to suppress the surging national independence movement in the colonies.

However, in the past period of time, the international situation has undergone fundamental changes. A new military adventure against socialist countries, especially for a country like Britain, has become a very dangerous thing. And the failure of the invasion of Egypt has sharply shown how fragile Britain's military position is, even in dealing with anti-colonialist struggles. At the same time, the one who has been encroaching on the interests of the British Empire and the Commonwealth is none other than Britain's number one "ally," the United States. Today, under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States has established its own dominant position in the Middle East, the main stronghold of British colonial power. This has made the struggle between the United States and Britain particularly acute. American newspapers have also openly belittled Britain's status as a great power, propagating that Britain has declined and can only obey the United States.

Under such circumstances, the British government is unwilling to abandon its position of opposing socialist countries and the independence movements of colonial peoples, and at the same time, it is trying to maintain Britain's status as a great power, maintain its right to speak in Western policy, and maintain its superior diplomatic position over the Commonwealth and Western European countries. While having to cut conventional military equipment, Britain must concentrate its efforts on developing nuclear weapons, insist on testing and manufacturing hydrogen bombs, and one of its purposes is to maintain this status.

The United States has always discouraged Britain from trying to master atomic weapons and even hydrogen weapons. During World War II, Britain participated in the development of the atomic bomb. But even at that time, in order to maintain its monopoly on atomic weapons, the United States blockaded Britain from information about the secrets of manufacturing atomic bombs. Since the end of the war, despite Britain's efforts and the fact that the United States and Britain have concluded an agreement on the exchange of atomic energy information, the United States is still unwilling to disclose to Britain the knowledge related to the manufacture of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. This blockade by the United States against Britain has retained a means of coercing Britain. Successive British governments have spared no effort to develop atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and one of the purposes is to break this monopoly of the United States.

An Independent Step

Of course, this British plan has great weaknesses. First of all, although the new plan stipulates that a considerable number of conventional troops will be reduced within five years, it also stipulates that efforts will be concentrated on developing nuclear weapons, which will still cause Britain to spend a lot of money, manpower and materials on arms expansion and war preparation. This will greatly discount Britain's efforts to reduce military spending and free up forces to strengthen trade competitiveness. Secondly, an important part of this new plan is to rely on the nuclear "deterrent force" of the United States. Britain will also rely on the United States to supply intermediate-range missiles and allow the United States to establish missile bases in Britain. The white paper also states that Britain will continue to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, these military blocs. This will make Britain often restrained by the United States in terms of reducing conventional military equipment, and will greatly limit Britain's autonomous rights in international affairs.

However, Britain, regardless of the opposition of the United States, reduced its conventional military equipment, and after all, took an independent step in the ranks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is the main reason why the United States is greatly disturbed.

Early before this plan was officially announced, the American newspapers have been reporting tirelessly that the American officials opposed Britain’s reduction of conventional army forces "too hastily and too much." The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization army, American General Norstad, repeatedly publicly opposed Britain’s reduction of army forces and the withdrawal of a part of British troops stationed in West Germany. It is reported that, at the Bermuda Conference, the U.S. and Britain had heated disputes over this issue, which delayed the publication of the conference communiqué; as a result, the communiqué did not mention this issue at all. At the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, there was another dispute over this issue, and there was no result.

The U.S.'s Concerns

According to British and American newspapers, the United States is most concerned about two points. First, the United States is worried that this action by Britain will increase the centrifugal tendencies of European "allies" and fuel the development of European "neutralism." For several years, the United States has been using the military system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to strengthen its control over European countries. Recently, Western European public opinion has pointed out from time to time that this system has been unable to adapt to the situation of nuclear weapons. And the Americans are now worried that Britain's actions will further weaken the confidence of Western European countries in conventional military equipment and this system, and thus be more "content with neutralism."

In terms of military deployment, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has a so-called "forward strategy," which is to deploy a large number of ground forces on the front line of West Germany to maintain a constant military threat to the socialist camp. According to the U.S. strategy, these ground forces must be mainly provided by the U.S.'s North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, and the U.S. mainly provides the naval and air forces. The U.S.'s "strategy" of wanting others to provide cannon fodder to be in the vanguard has long been dissatisfied with by Western European countries. Western European countries are suffering from heavy military spending, and have been actively demanding to reduce their own burdens for more than a year. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in May last year, the United States used the delaying tactics of promising to strengthen the political nature of this organization to get through the crisis. At the Council in December last year, the United States once again used the tense situation caused by the Egyptian War and the Hungarian Incident to perfunctorily get through. Now Britain is acting alone, reducing its conventional military equipment, and it is inevitable that other countries will not follow Britain's example and reduce their conventional military equipment. This will make the U.S.'s plan of wanting others to provide cannon fodder fall through. This is also something that the United States is unwilling to see.

Secondly, the United States is worried that the "chain reaction" caused by the British White Paper in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will result in the pace of West Germany's rearmament also being affected. West Germany is about to hold a general election in September this year, and Britain's actions to reduce conventional military strength will inevitably strengthen the forces in West Germany that oppose rearmament, which will force the Adenauer government to slow down its pace of arms expansion. After the publication of the British White Paper, West German Chancellor Adenauer and Defense Minister Strauss successively clamored that West German troops must also be equipped with nuclear weapons. American newspapers commented that Adenauer's demand for nuclear weapons is, on the one hand, to break the restriction of the Paris Agreement that does not allow West Germany to obtain atomic weapons, and on the other hand, to slow down the expansion of conventional troops. Rearming West Germany is the center of gravity of the U.S.'s post-war European policy, and it uses this method to deepen the division of Europe and create new tensions. It certainly does not want to see this policy being weakened.

The Struggle Continues

Of course, there will be extremely complex struggles on this issue. The United States, since it has not been able to dispel Britain's plan, is trying to limit the scale and process of the plan, and make Britain conduct the nuclear arms race under the control of the United States. For its own interests, Britain will adhere to its plan, but at the same time, because Britain is restrained by the United States in many places, it may also reach a compromise with the United States on certain steps. In fact, Britain has slowed down its reduction work due to the pressure of the United States. However, Britain cannot fail to see that, after it took a more resolute and independent approach to this issue, the United States, on another issue that it had always insisted on ignoring Britain's interests, namely the embargo issue, has shown more signs of considering Britain's views.

    英国国防白皮书发表以后
    华严
    在英国政府发表本年度的国防白皮书之后，一个多月以来西方国家报刊评论很多。从各方面的反应看来，这个白皮书在西方国家，特别是美国，引起了不小的震动。美国“纽约时报”说，它给美国提出了战后以来“最棘手”的问题。在最近举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯的一个主要任务就是阻止美国的西欧盟国不要追随英国的榜样。
    为什么一年一度的这个照例发表的国防白皮书今年引起美国这样大的震动呢？
    谋求减轻军费负担
    英国今年这个国防白皮书，提出了一个包含着一些新方针的五年方案。它的主要内容是：五年内将部队兵员总额削减将近一半，逐步裁撤某些地区的海外驻军；三军逐步核子化，在军火生产方面也将优先研究和制造核武器。但是在今后相当长一段时期内，在中距离和远射程的导弹方面，将依靠美国供给。
    英国在军事上采取这个收缩总兵力而集中力量从事核军备竞赛的新方针，有两方面的原因。
    最主要的一个原因是，英国的经济力量很难继续支持过去那样沉重的军费负担了。
    在朝鲜战争爆发后美国策动的扩军备战热潮中，英国是积极的。五年以来，英国在扩军备战上共用去了七十多亿英镑。在北大西洋集团各国中，除美国以外，英国军费负担超过所有其他成员国。
    过去五年来国防费用平均耗费了国民总产值的10％和劳动力的7％，并且消耗了金属加工业生产能力的八分之一。
    这样沉重的负担给英国经济造成了严重的恶果。它削弱了英国出口的竞争能力，使英国在资本主义世界市场上的地位趋于不利；它限制了英国为防止殖民帝国主义的瓦解所急需的海外投资的数额，使它对帝国的投资近年来危险地落后于美国；它也增加了国际收支上的困难，使英镑地位更为不稳，威胁英镑作为主要国际支付手段之一的信用。连英国的当权人士也不得不承认，巨大的军费是英国经济的一个致命伤。
    同样，在扩军备战上，维持大量常规军队并保持其现代化，同时又全面发展核武器，这也是英国力所不能胜任的。据英国国防大臣桑迪斯说，由于新武器费用昂贵，如果维持目前的军队规模，那末全年的军费就需要十七亿英镑。
    因此，英国不能不在经济破产和军费有所收缩之间作出抉择。白皮书表明，英国采取的是后一条路，逐步缩小常规军备，以集中力量进行三军核子化。
    企图保持大国地位
    二次大战结束以后，英国曾经同美国积极勾结一起，在军事上对社会主义国家采取包围和准备新战争的政策。同时，英国也调动了许多力量，竭力镇压殖民地中风起云涌的争取民族独立运动。
    但是在过去的一段时间里，国际局势已经发生了根本的变化。对社会主义国家进行新的军事冒险特别对于像英国这样的国家已经变得是一件十分危险的事。而侵略埃及战争的失败尖锐地表明了，即使在对付反殖民主义斗争方面，英国的军事地位也已经是如何脆弱。同时，战后对英帝国和联邦利益节节进逼的不是别人，正是英国的头号“盟友”美国。今天，美国在“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗帜下，在英国殖民势力的主要阵地中东，建立起自己的优势地位。这使得美英之间的这一斗争分外尖锐起来。美国报刊还公开贬低英国的大国地位，宣传英国已经衰落，只有听命于美国。
    在这种情况下，英国政府既不愿意放弃它的反对社会主义国家和殖民地人民独立运动的立场，又力图保持英国的大国地位，保持在西方政策中的发言权，以及对英联邦和西欧国家的优势外交地位。英国在不得不裁减常规军备的同时，又要集中力量发展核武器，坚持试验和制造氢弹，它的一个目的就是为了保持这种地位。
    美国对于英国试图掌握原子武器乃至氢武器的作法，一向是不鼓励的。二次大战期间，原子弹的试制工作原是有英国参加的。但是就在那时，美国为了保持原子武器的垄断地位，就对英国封锁有关制造原子弹的秘密。大战结束以来，虽经英国力争，而且英美还缔结了关于交换原子能情报的协定，美国仍然不肯将有关制造原子武器和氢武器的知识透露给英国。美国对英国的这种封锁，保留了一个挟制英国的手段。英国历届政府不惜耗费巨大力量试制原子武器和氢武器，目的之一也正是为了打破美国这种垄断。
    一个独立的步子
    当然，英国这个方案有着很大的弱点。首先，这个新方案虽规定五年内缩减相当多的常规军队，但它又规定集中力量发展核武器，这就将使英国仍然在扩军备战方面消耗大量金钱、人力和物资。这将使英国削减军费、腾出力量以加强贸易竞争能力的努力大打折扣。其次，这个新方案的一个重要部分是依靠美国的核子“威慑力量”，英国还将依赖美国供给中程导弹，并允许美国在英国建立导弹基地。白皮书还声明英国将继续支持北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约这些军事集团。这就将使英国在缩减常规军队方面经常受到美国的牵制，并将大大限制英国在国际事务中的自主权利。
    不过，英国不顾美国的反对而裁减常规军备，究竟在北大西洋集团的队伍中，首先迈出了一个独立的步子。这也就是使美国大为不安的主要地方。
    早在这个方案尚未正式宣布时，美国报纸已经不惮其烦地报道美国官方反对英国“过急过多地”裁减常规军队了。北大西洋集团军总司令美国将军诺斯塔德多次公开反对英国裁减军队和撤回一部分驻在西德的英军。据报道，在百慕大会议上，英美曾经为这个问题发生激烈争吵，以至于延缓了会议公报的发表；结果公报中对这个问题只字未提。在最近这次北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上，又就这个问题进行了争论，也没有结果。
    美国的担心
    据英美报刊报道，美国最担心的有两点。首先，美国担心英国这一行动会增加欧洲“盟国”的离心倾向，助长欧洲“中立主义”的发展。几年来，美国一直是利用北大西洋公约的军事体制来加强它对欧洲国家的控制的。近来，西欧国家舆论不时指出，这个体制已经不能适应核武器的局面。而美国人现在担心，英国的行动会更加削弱西欧国家对常规军备和这个体制的信心，因而更“安于中立主义”。
    在军事部署方面，北大西洋集团有一种所谓“前沿战略”，就是在西德前沿布置大量地面部队，对社会主义阵营保持经常的军事威胁。按照美国的战略，这些地面部队主要须由美国的北大西洋集团伙伴来提供，美国则主要提供海空军。美国这个要别人出炮灰冲头阵的“战略”久已为西欧各国所不满。西欧国家苦于军费沉重，过去一年多以来就积极要求减轻自己的负担。去年5月的北大西洋集团理事会上，美国以答应加强这一组织的政治性质的拖延战术得以渡过难关。去年12月的理事会上，美国又利用埃及战争和匈牙利事件使时局一度紧张，敷衍了过去。现在英国单独行动，裁减了常规军队，难免各国不效法英国榜样，纷纷裁减常规军队。这就会使美国要别人出炮灰的打算落空。这也是美国所不愿意看到的事情。
    其次，美国担心英国白皮书在北大西洋集团各国引起的“连锁反应”，结果将使西德重新武装的步调也受到影响。西德今年9月即将举行大选，英国裁减常规兵力的行动势必加强西德国内反对重新武装的力量，这将迫使阿登纳政府放慢扩军步骤。在英国白皮书发表后，西德总理阿登纳和国防部长施特劳斯接连叫嚷西德军队也必须装备核武器。美国报纸评论说，阿登纳要求得到核武器，一方面是要打破巴黎协定不准西德获得原子武器的限制，另一方面也是想放慢常规部队的扩充工作。重新武装西德是美国战后欧洲政策的重心，它用这个办法来加深欧洲的分裂并制造新的紧张局势。它当然不愿意看到这个政策受到削弱。
    斗争在继续中
    当然，在这个问题上还会有极其复杂的斗争。美国既没有能够打消英国的计划，就设法限制计划的规模和进程，并使英国在美国控制下进行核军备的竞赛。英国为了它本身的利益，将坚持它的方案，但同时英国由于在许多地方受到美国的牵制，因而也可能在某些步骤上同美国取得妥协。事实上英国已经因为美国的压力而放慢了裁减工作。不过英国不可能不看到，在它在这个问题上采取了较为坚决的独立作法以后，美国在另一个过去一直坚持漠视英国利益的问题即禁运问题上，倒表现了较多考虑英国意见的迹象。
