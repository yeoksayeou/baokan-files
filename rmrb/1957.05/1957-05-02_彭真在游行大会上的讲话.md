Comrades, Fellow countrymen, Guests!

Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a celebration parade to celebrate May Day International Labor Day and the festival of unity for working people around the world.

Participating in our meeting are national labor models and advanced workers in industry and agriculture, representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as representatives of ethnic minorities from all over the country and representatives of returned overseas Chinese. We would like to extend a warm welcome to them and extend warm congratulations, heartfelt thanks, and respect to the workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and all compatriots who have actively produced, worked hard, and studied hard in all aspects over the past year. I wish you all greater achievements.

Today, among those attending our meeting are Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of our great ally, the Soviet Union, the delegation of the Grand National Assembly of Romania and the Bucharest City People's Council headed by Comrade Constantin Pîrvulescu, the Speaker of the House of Nationalities of Burma, Sao Hkun Hkio, and distinguished guests from forty-six countries. We express our warm welcome, deep gratitude and respect to them. We will always unite with the great Soviet people, always unite with the people of socialist countries, and always unite with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and persevere in the cause of world peace and human progress.

Comrades, Fellow countrymen!

Our country has now entered the period of socialist construction from the revolutionary period. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved great victories. The large-scale mass class struggle in the country has basically ended. Social relations have undergone fundamental changes, and people's ideological consciousness is also changing accordingly. We will follow Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference, implement the policies of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, correctly handle contradictions among the people, and better mobilize all positive forces, so that we can more smoothly complete the great task of transforming a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the working class of our country and its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, must further and better lead the transformation of the entire society and the construction of the new society, and must also transform themselves. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions on the rectification movement, and will conduct a universal and in-depth rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism throughout the party again. We must strengthen the close ties between the Party and the government and the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students and intellectuals, strengthen the great unity of the 600 million people of the country, and must continue to implement the mass line and the principle of "building the country with diligence and thrift."

In order to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is advocating within the party that every major leading cadre of party, government, and military at all levels, who has some labor power, should spend part of their time participating in physical labor together with workers and farmers. When this method is implemented, it can integrate leaders with the masses in actual life and give the relationship among the people a new look. On the occasion of celebrating May Day Labor Day, let us better combine mental and physical labor, let the people of the whole country unite as one, march in unison, and use our labor to develop our production and culture, and create our happy life!

Now, our celebration parade begins, please Chairman Mao and other central leaders and our distinguished guests review our ranks.

    彭真在游行大会上的讲话同胞们，同志们，来宾们！
    今天，我们首都的各界人民举行庆祝游行大会，庆祝五一国际劳动节，庆祝全世界劳动人民团结的节日。
    参加我们大会的有全国的工业和农业的劳动模范和先进工作者，有中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的代表，也有来自各地的少数民族代表，有归国华侨代表，我们谨向他们表示热烈的欢迎，我们向一年来在各个方面积极生产、努力工作、努力学习的工人、农民、学生、知识分子和一切同胞们表示热烈的祝贺，表示衷心的感谢和敬意。祝大家取得更大的成就。
    今天参加我们大会的，有我们伟大的盟邦苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志，有以康·帕伏列斯库同志为首的罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团，有缅甸民族院萧恢塔议长，有来自四十六个国家的各方面的贵宾们。我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎，表示深切的感谢和敬意。我们将永远同伟大的苏联人民团结在一起，永远同社会主义各国人民团结在一起，永远同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结在一起，为世界和平和人类进步的事业坚持奋斗。同胞们，同志们！ 
    我们的国家现在已经从革命时期进入了社会主义建设时期。农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造都已经取得了伟大的胜利，国内大规模的群众性的阶级斗争已经基本上结束，社会的关系已经发生了根本的变化，人们的思想意识也在随着发生变化。我们将按照毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣和长期共存、互相监督的方针，正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，更好地调动一切积极的力量，使我们更加顺利地完成变落后的农业国为先进的社会主义工业国的伟大任务。
    中共中央认为我国的工人阶级和它的先锋队中国共产党要进一步地更好地领导全社会的改造和新社会的建设，就必须同时改造自己，因此，中共中央已经发出了关于整风运动的指示，要在全党重新进行一次普遍的深入的反对官僚主义、反对宗派主义、反对主观主义的整风运动。我们必须加强党和政府同工人群众、农民群众、士兵群众、学生和知识分子群众的紧密联系，加强全国六亿人民的大团结，必须继续贯彻执行群众路线和“勤俭建国”的方针。
    为了保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，中共中央正在党内提倡各级党政军每一个多少有些劳动力的主要领导人员，用一部分时间同工人农民一起参加体力劳动，这个办法实行起来，就可以在实际生活中使领导者同群众打成一片，使人民内部的关系面貌一新。在庆祝五一劳动节的今天，让我们把脑力劳动和体力劳动更好地结合起来吧，让我们全国人民万众一心、步伐整齐地用自己的劳动来发展我们的生产和文化，创造我们的幸福的生活吧！
    现在，我们的庆祝游行大会开始，请毛主席和中央其他领导同志们和我们的贵宾们检阅我们的队伍。
