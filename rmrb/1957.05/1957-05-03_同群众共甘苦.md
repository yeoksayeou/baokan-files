Our Party has always maintained the closest ties with the working people and has always shared weal and woe with the masses. This is our Party's fine tradition. However, in recent years, after the revolution's victory, the Party has led the people's political power nationwide, and many comrades have developed complacency, become tainted with the bad habits of the old society, gradually become detached from the masses, and damaged the Party's flesh-and-blood ties with the masses. Therefore, the Party Central Committee's recent instructions regarding the rectification campaign pointed out: "Currently, the Party's task, in addition to carrying out rectification and study, improving ideological understanding within the Party, and correcting shortcomings and errors in work, is also to fully maintain and develop our Party's fine tradition of hard struggle in practical life, and to begin further establishing a fundamental system combining mental and physical labor for the Party and state leading personnel, so that leaders and the masses can integrate, the relationship within the people can take on a new look, and bureaucracy, sectarianism, subjectivism, and official airs can be greatly reduced."

Maintaining and developing our Party's fine tradition of hard struggle is of decisive significance for our country's socialist cause. We remember that in the past long revolutionary struggle, no hardship or difficulty could ever make us yield. In those years of arduous struggle, cadres and the masses, superiors and subordinates, the army and the people, officers and soldiers, shared life and death, weal and woe, and were solidified into an unbreakable and uncrushable iron and steel whole. During the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War, our revolutionary army and revolutionary cadres, on the one hand, had to persist in the struggle against the enemy under difficult conditions, and on the other hand, also participated in production together with the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "On the Army's Production for Self-Sufficiency, and on the Importance of the Two Great Movements of Rectification and Production" written in April 1945: "The widespread rectification movement and production movement, which began in 1942 and 1943 respectively, have played and are playing a decisive role in the spiritual life and material life." At that time, the rectification movement resolved the contradiction between proletarian ideology and non-proletarian ideology, that is, between Marxist ideology and non-Marxist ideology, within the vast number of cadres. The production movement solved the serious contradictions that existed at that time regarding insufficient grain, oil, salt, clothing, and funds; and it also made officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, the army, cadres, and the people more intimate like brothers in production labor, further enhanced the concept of labor among every member of the revolutionary ranks, and promoted the mass production movement of the entire people. These two great movements became the foundation for all other combat tasks and the guarantee for the complete liberation of the Chinese people.

The people in the vast countryside of our country all remember the fine style of our Party's cadres sharing weal and woe with the masses in the struggle to reform the land system. At that time, the "land reform cadres" who were active in the countryside ate, lived, and worked with the peasant masses everywhere. In the struggle, the staff raised the class consciousness of the masses, and the masses also raised the class consciousness of the staff. Many staff members became good friends with the peasants. Only in this way could the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the deeply rooted feudal forces achieve a comprehensive and thorough victory in a very short period of time, and make the ensuing patriotic and abundant production movement develop vigorously.

Recently, under the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the staff of leadership organs at all levels have implemented "layer-by-layer devolution." Many of the cadres who have been sent down to the countryside have already "settled down" in the countryside, and many have also participated in production labor together with the masses. As a result, words like these have begun to spread everywhere: "The old Eighth Route Army is back!" "The cadres from the time of the land reform are back!" Why do the masses say this? It is worth pondering deeply. This is praise, and it is also criticism. The praise is that the cadres are again sharing weal and woe with the masses, and the criticism is that many people have left this glorious tradition.

Of course, only a section of people have left this glorious tradition. There are many old comrades who have adhered to the style of hard work and simplicity in any situation, and their thinking has not rusted. Here, let's just give a few examples. Huo Shiren, the Secretary of the Hezheng County Party Committee in Gansu Province, spends more than half of his time living in the countryside every year. He can recite the names of every village in the county, is familiar with the natural environment and social situation of each village, knows which village is suitable for planting which crops, and understands the family situation, work situation, character, and strengths of every commune director and most production team leaders above. When he appears in any village, the people of that village surround him to talk to him. He is accustomed to working in the fields and on the threshing floor, chatting and talking with the masses while working. Li Liancheng, the County Head of Pingding County, Shanxi Province, also spends half of his time in agricultural cooperatives every year. When he goes to the countryside, he always carries his bedding on foot and often goes deep into the fields and households to talk to the peasants. The principal and teachers of Kunming Aviation Industry School help students move their luggage, eat with the students in the "open-air cafeteria," and try every means to solve the students' difficulties of lacking quilts and clothes, and are always considerate of the students who are far away from their hometowns. The teachers and students of Lanzhou No. 2 Aviation Industry Technical School jointly build school buildings. These two newly established schools, where living and learning conditions are very difficult, are run vigorously and are full of an atmosphere of unity, friendship, and enthusiasm for learning. In industrial and mining enterprises, there are also many people who maintain the style of sharing weal and woe with the masses. The deeds of Liang Yanbin, the Secretary of the Party Branch of the Xiangfan City Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei, and others published in this newspaper today are worth emulating by everyone. They live in the factory and are familiar with the workers' family situation, health conditions, and ideological trends. They squat with the workers to eat and often participate in the workers' spare-time activities. Under their influence, the workers truly regard the factory as their own home, and mutual concern among all employees has become a common practice. There are many county Party secretaries, county heads, principals, and factory Party committee secretaries like these all over the country. Since so many comrades can adhere to and develop this style, why can't some comrades do it? This cannot be attributed to the objective environment, and these comrades can only be asked to examine themselves and "examine themselves thrice daily."

Every revolutionary worker should not think that he is superior to the "ordinary people," or that mental workers are superior to physical workers. These are all old ideas of the past exploiting classes, and for us, they are extremely decadent and extremely absurd ideas. Our concept is: everyone is equal - this equality is based on the elimination of the phenomenon of people exploiting people. We advocate that everyone lives by their own labor, rather than encroaching on other people's labor achievements. Our state organs are different from the state organs of the exploiters. The state organs of the exploiting classes are tools for maintaining the system of exploitation; while our state organs are tools for protecting the interests of the workers. Every one of the staff of our state organs stands on an equal footing with the workers and peasants, and they do different work from other working people, which is just a necessary social division of labor. Due to the different work tasks, the complexity of the work, and the work conditions, their labor remuneration and living conditions will be somewhat different from those of other working people at the current stage of socialist development, just as there are differences in labor remuneration between workers. As long as this difference is reasonable, then this difference is normal and can be accepted by the masses. However, if this difference is magnified, magnified to an unreasonable extent, it will have dangerous consequences. We must foresee this dangerous tendency and prevent it as early as possible. We must enable the leading personnel of Party and government organs at all levels to share weal and woe with the masses, prove with facts that they are standing on an equal footing with the masses, and take the initiative to consciously regulate the contradictions between leaders and the masses in all aspects.

The reason why the participation of leading personnel at all levels in physical labor is of great significance is that doing so can fundamentally change the dangerous tendency of leaders becoming detached from the masses. Many leading and management personnel do not have no time to directly participate in production labor other than doing leadership work and management work. If they have time and opportunity, what reason do they have not to directly participate in production labor? It is difficult to find a reason that truly becomes a reason. Some people are unwilling to do so, simply because they have added something unrelated to revolutionaries - "official airs." They seem to have forgotten that they are a member of the working people, a servant of the people, and forgotten that labor is the most glorious thing.

Any revolutionary worker should refuse to enjoy any privileges and oppose making their life special. This is not advocating egalitarianism. Leading personnel should often integrate with the people, which does not mean that every cadre should be in the countryside or in the workshop all year round. That is impossible and unnecessary. However, as long as it is possible to go to the masses, one should go to the masses. If it is possible to go for a few days, go for a few days, and if it is possible to go for a few hours, go for a few hours, there is always benefit.

Sharing weal and woe with the masses in practical action is the most effective political education work - for the masses and for the cadres themselves. Telling the masses how much better life is now than in the past, how much better it will be in the future than it is now, what kind of dangers and difficulties were experienced in the revolution in the past, and how we should endure difficulties and fight against difficulties at present, the masses will believe it. However, if our staff can lead the masses to fight against difficulties by setting an example, then the effect of such ideological and political work will be many times greater.

At the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Liu Shaoqi made a political report on behalf of the Party Central Committee, and we should bear in mind and practice the following passage: "An important sign of a good Party member and a good leader lies in his familiarity with the people's living conditions and labor conditions, his concern for the people's sufferings, and his understanding of the people's hearts; he adheres to the style of hard work and simplicity, shares weal and woe with the people, can accept the people's criticism and supervision, and does not put on any airs in front of the people; he consults with the masses when he has something to do, and the masses are willing to talk to him when they have something to say. As long as our Party is composed of such Party members, we will always have endless and invincible power."

Every leading person must care about the sufferings of the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and do everything possible to help the masses overcome difficulties. Break down all the artificial barriers between yourself and the masses! Sweep away the legacy of class society as quickly as clearing garbage! Put down the "official airs" and go among the masses!

### 同群众共甘苦

    同群众共甘苦
    我们的党从来是同劳动人民保持最密切的联系的，从来是同群众共甘苦的。这是我们党的优良传统。但是近几年来，革命胜利了，党领导了全国的人民政权，有许多同志却滋长了骄傲的情绪，沾染了旧社会的恶习，逐渐脱离了群众，损害了党同群众的血肉联系。因此，党中央最近发表的关于整风运动的指示中指出：“目前党的任务，除了进行整风学习，提高党内思想认识、改正工作中的缺点错误以外，还要在实际生活中完全保持和发扬我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，并且着手进一步建立党和国家的领导工作人员的脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的根本制度，使领导者同群众打成一片，使人民内部的关系面貌一新，使官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义、老爷架子，大大减少。”
    保持和发扬我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，这对于我国的社会主义事业具有决定的意义。我们记得，在过去长期革命斗争中，任何的艰苦困难都没有能够使我们屈服。在那些艰苦斗争的年月里，干部和群众，上级和下级，军队和人民，军官和士兵，同生死，共患难，凝结成了打不烂压不碎的钢铁一般的整体。在抗日游击战争时期，我们的革命军队和革命干部，一面要在困难的条件下坚持对敌斗争，一面还同群众一起参加了生产。毛泽东同志在1945年4月写的“论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性”一文中指出：“1942和1943两年先后开始的带普遍性的整风运动和生产运动，曾经分别在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了和正在起着决定性的作用。”当时的整风运动在广大干部中解决了党内无产阶级思想和非无产阶级思想，即马克思主义思想和非马克思主义思想之间的矛盾。当时的生产运动解决了当时存在着的粮食、油盐、被服、经费不足的严重矛盾；并且使军官和士兵，上级和下级，军队、干部和人民群众在生产劳动中更加亲如兄弟，使革命队伍里的每一个成员进一步增强了劳动观念，并且促进了全体人民的大生产运动。这两大运动，成为其他各项战斗任务的基础，成为中国人民彻底解放的保证。
    我国广大乡村的人民，都记得在改革土地制度的斗争中，我们党的干部同群众共甘苦的优良作风。当时活跃在农村中的“土改干部”到处跟农民群众同吃、同住、同劳动。在斗争中，工作人员提高了群众的阶级觉悟，群众也提高了工作人员的阶级觉悟。许多工作人员同农民交成了好朋友。只是因为这样，推翻根深蒂固的封建势力的革命斗争才得以在很短的时间内得到了全面的彻底的胜利，并且使接踵而至的爱国丰产运动蓬蓬勃勃地发展了起来。
    最近一个时期，在党中央的指示下，各级领导机关的工作人员实行“层层下放”。下放到农村去的干部，许多人已经在农村“安家落户”，许多人又同群众一起参加了生产劳动。于是，各地开始流传着这样的话：“老八路又来了！”“土改时候的干部又来了！”群众为什么这样说呢？很值得我们深思。这是称赞，也是批评。称赞的是干部又同群众共甘苦了，批评的是曾经有许多人离开了这个光荣传统。
    当然，离开了这个光荣传统的只是一部分人。有许多老同志，在任何情况下都坚持着艰苦朴素作风，他们的思想并没有生锈。这里姑且随便举几个例来说。甘肃省和政县委书记霍世仁，每年有一半以上的时间生活在乡村里。他能背得出全县每个村落的名字，熟悉每个村庄的自然环境和社会情况，知道哪个村子适合种哪种庄稼，了解全县每个社主任和大部分生产队长以上干部的家庭情况和工作情况、性格和特长。他在哪个村子出现，哪个村子的人们就围上来跟他谈话。他习惯在地里和打谷场上，一边干活，一边同群众说笑谈心。山西省平定县长李连城，也是每年总有半数时间在农业社里。他下乡总是背着铺盖步行，而且时常深入田间、户内跟农民谈心。昆明航空工业学校的校长和教师帮学生搬行李，同学生一起在“露天食堂”吃饭，想尽一切办法给学生解决缺被子缺衣服的困难，随时为远离家乡的学生着想。兰州第二航空工业技术学校师生共同劳动建筑校舍。这两个刚创办的、生活条件和学习条件都十分困难的学校办得生气勃勃，充满了团结友爱、热心学习的空气。在工矿企业里，保持着同群众共甘苦的作风的人也不少。今天本报发表的湖北襄樊市棉织厂支部书记梁彦斌等的事迹就很值得大家仿效。他们住在厂里，熟悉工人的家庭状况、健康状况和思想动态。他们同工人蹲在一起吃饭，经常参加工人的业余活动。在他们的影响下，工人真正把工厂当成了自己的家，全体职工互相关心成了风气。像这样的县委书记、县长、校长、工厂党委书记，全国各地都有很多。既然有这么多同志能够坚持和发扬这种作风，为什么有些同志就偏偏做不到呢？这不能推到客观环境，只能要求这些同志反躬自问，“三省吾身”。
    每个革命工作者，都不可以认为自己比“普通老百姓”高一等，或者认为脑力劳动者比体力劳动者高一等。这些都是过去剥削阶级的旧观念，对我们来说，是极其腐朽极端荒谬的观念。我们的观念是：人人平等——这平等是建立在消灭人剥削人的现象的基础上的。我们主张人人都靠自己的劳动来生活，而不侵占别人的劳动成果。我们的国家机关跟剥削者的国家机关不同。剥削阶级的国家机关是维持剥削制度的工具；而我们的国家机关是保护劳动者利益的工具。我们的国家机关的工作人员，每一个人，都是同工农劳动人民站在同等地位的，他们同别的劳动人民做着不同的工作，这只是必要的社会分工。由于工作任务、工作繁简、工作条件的不同，他们的劳动报酬和生活情况，在社会主义的目前发展阶段，同其他劳动人民会有一些差别，这也正如同工人同工人之间的劳动报酬有所差别一样。只要这种差别是合情合理的，那么，这种差别也是正常的，能为群众接受的。可是，如果把这种差别扩大化，扩大到不合理的程度，那就会发生危险的后果。我们必须预见这种危险的倾向，及早加以防止。我们要使各级党政领导人员同群众共甘苦，用事实证明自己同群众是站在平等的地位，主动地自觉地从各方面调节领导者和群众之间的矛盾。
    各级领导人员参加体力劳动之所以具有重大意义，就因为这样做可以从根本上改变领导脱离群众的危险倾向。很多领导人员和管理人员，并不是除了做领导工作、管理工作就再也没有时间可以直接参加生产劳动了。如果有时间，有机会，他们有什么理由不能直接参加生产劳动呢？很难找出真正成为理由的理由来。有些人不愿意这样做，只不过是因为在他们身上已经多了一种同革命者无关的东西——“官架子”。他们似乎忘了自己是劳动人民的一分子，是人民的勤务员，忘了劳动是最光荣的事情。
    任何一个革命工作人员都应该拒绝享受任何特权，反对使自己的生活特殊化。这并不是提倡平均主义。领导人员应该经常同人民群众打成一片，这并不是说每个干部都要常年在农村里、在车间里。那是不可能也不必要的。但是，只要有可能到群众中去，就应该到群众中去。有可能去几天就去几天，有可能去几小时就去几小时，总是有好处的。
    在实际行动上同群众共甘苦，这是一种最有效的政治教育工作——对群众，对干部自己，都是这样。向群众讲现在的生活比过去怎么好，将来会比现在又怎么好，过去在革命中经历过怎样的艰险困难，目前应该怎样忍受困难、同困难搏斗，群众是会相信的。可是，如果我们的工作人员能够以身作则，带领群众去同困难作斗争，那么，这样的思想政治工作的效果就要大许多倍。
    在党的第八次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志代表党中央所作的政治报告中有一段话，我们应该牢记心头，身体力行：“一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督，不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。只要我们的党是由这样的党员组成的，我们就永远有无穷无尽的、不可征服的力量。”
    每个领导人员一定要做到关心群众痛痒，同群众共甘苦，并且尽一切努力帮助群众克服困难。把自己同群众中间的一切人为的障碍都打破吧！把阶级社会遗留的影响尽快地像清除垃圾那样扫除掉吧！放下“官架子”，走到群众中间去吧！
