Combined reports from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reported: A spokesperson for the Jakarta Garrison Command announced on May 11 that the military had uncovered an illegal activity case involving an attempt to launch an armed coup in Indonesia.

The spokesperson said in a communique that some civilians and soldiers have been arrested, including Izhar, the commissioner of the "Wild Bull Division Committee" stationed in Jakarta, and Syamsudin, the captain of the Military Law Academy cadets. Documents and written materials seized prove that these people were engaged in "illegal activities aimed at changing the structure of the country," attempting to launch an armed coup, and that a group of civilians possessed a batch of weapons lost by the army.

The seized documents also included a "program to change the structure of the country in an unconstitutional manner." These documents prove that these people have established contact and cooperation with the rebel "Islamic Army" group and other regions.

Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution has taken over the recently uncovered subversion case from the Jakarta military authorities. An army headquarters spokesman said on the 12th that Nasution had reported the situation of the case to the government.
