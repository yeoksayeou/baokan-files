    The Stink of Copper Mixed with Fragrance

    In the increasingly fierce competition, American capitalists spare no effort and rack their brains to come up with all sorts of bizarre "ways to make money" to attract customers. Recently, a kind of "fragrance business" has become popular in the United States. It can give car tires a smell "like newly polished leather shoes." People only need to spend a few dollars to make a bicycle emit the scent of a new car.

    Opening a bottle of special ink will release the scent of fresh fruit. Fertilizer sprinkled on the fields will have a minty smell. Special cashier's rubber finger cots can make the banknotes counted emit a floral fragrance. It is said that this "science of scent" business has developed to a level of $250 million a year.

    铜臭掺香味
    在日益激烈的竞争下，美国的资本家为了招徕顾客，不惜呕尽心血，想出种种千奇百怪的“生财之道”。最近在美国开始流行一种“香气买卖”。它可以使汽车轮胎有一种“像新擦油的皮鞋”的味道。人们只要花上几块钱就可以使一辆脚踏车发出一股新车所具有的气味。
    打开一瓶特制的墨水，就会有一股新鲜水果的气味。肥田粉洒在田地上时会带有薄荷的味道，特制的出纳员的橡皮手指套，可以使点过的钞票发出鲜花般的香味。据说这种“气味科学”的买卖已发展到一年二亿五千万美元的水平。
