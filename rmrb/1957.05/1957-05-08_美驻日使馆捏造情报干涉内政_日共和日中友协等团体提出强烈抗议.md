    Tokyo Dispatch from Our Newspaper: According to the "Akahata" newspaper, the Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency of Japan, citing intelligence released by the U.S. Embassy in Japan, insisted that the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, the Peace Committee, and other groups used 7.2 billion yen last year for "red propaganda" and claimed that they would be investigated under the Subversive Activities Prevention Act. The Japanese Communist Party and the above three groups have lodged a serious protest with the Japanese government regarding this matter.
    The issue of the 7.2 billion yen "red propaganda" expenditure was mentioned by the Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency, Fujii, in his speech to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on April 19. On the same day, Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement pointing out that the intelligence released by the U.S. Embassy in Japan was completely fabricated rumors. He also pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Japan was conducting investigations that were in fact espionage activities, which was direct interference in Japan's internal affairs. The Public Security Investigation Agency's arbitrary expansion of the interpretation of the Subversive Activities Prevention Act, listing the Japanese Communist Party as an object of investigation, was an attempt to implement McCarthyism in Japan and attack democratic forces.
    On April 22, Sanzo Nosaka and Masao Iwama, a Japanese Communist Party member of the House of Councillors, met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishida, and then met with Justice Minister Nakamura, submitting a letter of protest to Prime Minister Kishi. The protest letter raised four demands: 1. Immediately stop improperly interpreting the Subversive Activities Prevention Act and treating the Japanese Communist Party as an object of investigation; 2. Immediately stop the investigation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and other three groups; 3. Immediately stop listing members of the Diet as objects of investigation; 4. Dismiss Fujii, Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency.
    On April 24, representatives of the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, accompanied by Socialist Party members of the Diet, met with Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi (who was absent, with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tanaka meeting them on his behalf) and Justice Minister Nakamura, and submitted letters of protest. Justice Minister Nakamura stated that he would check the shorthand records and properly handle any areas that needed correction.

    美驻日使馆捏造情报干涉内政
    日共和日中友协等团体提出强烈抗议
    本报东京航讯　据“赤旗报”消息：日本公安调查厅长官援引美驻日大使馆公布的情报，硬说日本共产党、日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会、和平委员会等团体去年曾用七十二亿日元进行“赤化宣传”，并声称将根据防止破坏活动法加以调查。日本共产党和上述三团体，就这个问题向日本政府提出严重抗议。
    七十二亿日元“赤化宣传”费用问题，是公安调查厅长官藤井在4月19日众议院外交委员会上的发言中提到的。当天，日共第一书记野坂参三即发表谈话，指出美驻日大使馆公布的情报，完全是捏造出来的流言；同时指出美驻日大使馆进行这类实际上是间谍活动的调查，是直接干涉日本内政；公安调查厅任意扩大解释防止破坏活动法，把日共列为调查对象，是想在日本实行麦卡锡主义，进攻民主力量。
    4月22日，野坂参三和日共参议院议员岩间正男会见石田官房长官，接着又会见中村法相，提交了写给岸首相的抗议书。抗议书中提出了四点要求：一、立即停止不当地解释防止破坏活动法把日共当作调查对象；二、立即停止对日中友协等三团体的调查活动；三、立即停止把国会议员列为调查对象；四、罢免公安调查厅长官藤井。
    4月24日，日本和平委员会、日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会的代表偕同社会党议员会见岸信介首相（岸不在，由官房副长官田中代行会见）和中村法相，并且提交了抗议书。中村法相表示：将核对速记记录，应该更正的地方当妥善处理。
