To commemorate the 15th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the Chinese Writers Association and the People's Daily Editorial Department jointly invited writers in Beijing, including Bai Wei, Liu Baiyu, Li Ji, Wang Jingzhi, Zhou Libo, Kang Tuo, Guo Xiaochuan, Yang Shuo, Bi Ye, Xiao Qian, etc. (some invited writers did not attend due to other commitments), to hold a discussion on the issue of writers immersing themselves in life on the afternoon of the 18th of this month.

Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, entrusted Vice Chairman Shao Quanlin to preside over the discussion (Mao Dun had a written statement). Shao Quanlin said at the beginning of the discussion: Today's discussion will only focus on one issue, which is the issue and experience of immersing oneself in the life of the masses. This is the most fundamental issue of the "Talks." The achievements and development in creation over the past fifteen years lie in this. Some people say that creation has declined in the past fifteen years, and I disagree with this view. Of course, in the past fifteen years, there have been successful experiences and failed experiences. I hope everyone can freely talk about this issue, and I believe this will benefit readers and young authors. If this issue is resolved well, subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism can also be better resolved.

Then, the writers expressed their opinions on this issue separately. In his speech, Yang Shuo recalled the changes in his thoughts and feelings about immersing himself in life and integrating with the masses. When Zhou Libo talked about his experience of immersing himself in life, he particularly emphasized that he must often be among the people, because life changes very quickly. He also made sharp criticisms of many phenomena of the literary and art circles being divorced from the masses. He said: "Even if writers are not among the people but are in the city, they should get closer to the masses. Writers should take more buses, pedicabs, and trams, and not take cars. This way, you will observe many problems in life and will not be divorced from the masses. Because the surrounding people are all working people, this provides opportunities to approach people from all walks of life. Many comrades are unwilling to do this." He also said that when comrades in the literary and art circles watch movies and observe dramas, they limit themselves to the literary and art circle, which is a way of being divorced from the masses. Intellectuals have a small circle and do not get close to the masses. In literature, this is a "suicidal policy." In his speech, Bi Ye focused on his recent experience of going to Xinjiang to immerse himself in the life of the troops. Bai Wei revealed, from her experience of going down to the countryside, the bureaucratism, detachment from the masses, and serious damage to state property of some leaders in some farms (she is writing an article on this aspect of the material). She also talked about the discrimination she encountered when she experienced life in the Northeast. She said that in some farms in the Northeast, the leaders kept silent about the affairs of the farms to the writers who went down, and they would not talk about it no matter how much they asked. They said that it was not easy to deal with people who write articles. They also tried to obstruct writers who wanted to go to places where work was more difficult. She said that if this phenomenon is not corrected, it will cause great difficulties for writers to immerse themselves in life. Finally, Wang Jingzhi spoke, criticizing the current issue of cultivating writers.

Due to time constraints, some of the writers who attended did not have time to speak. Shao Quanlin said: This discussion was very good. Comrade Bi Ye spoke well, he wanted to weave his own thread into the fabric of the masses. His experience can be written into very beautiful prose and novels, and I hope he will write them. Comrades who did not have time to speak today can write written opinions and publish them in the People's Daily. I believe this will be beneficial to writers and readers.

    纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十五周年
    在京作家畅谈深入生活的体会
    本报讯　本月18日下午，为了纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十五周年，中国作家协会和人民日报编辑部联合邀请了在京作家白薇、刘白羽、李季、汪静之、周立波、康濯、郭小川、杨朔、碧野、萧乾等（还有一些被邀请的作家因事没有出席）举行座谈会，讨论关于作家深入生活的问题。
    中国作家协会主席茅盾委托副主席邵荃麟主持这次座谈会（茅盾有书面发言）。邵荃麟在座谈一开始的时候说：今天的座谈会只谈一个问题，就是深入群众生活的问题和经验，这也是“讲话”的最根本的问题。十五年来创作上所以有成就，有发展，就在这里。有人说十五年来的创作是衰退了，我不同意这种看法。当然，十五年来，有成功的经验，也有失败的经验。希望大家能就这个问题畅谈一下，我相信这会对读者和青年作者都有益处。如果这个问题解决好了，主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义，也就能得到更好的解决。
    接着，作家们分别就这个问题发表自己的意见。杨朔在发言里，回忆了他在深入生活和群众结合的思想感情的变化过程。周立波在谈到自己深入生活的体会的时候，特别强调必须经常在下面，因为生活变化得非常快。他还对文艺界的许多脱离群众的现象，提出了尖锐的批评。他说：“即使作家没有在下面、而在城市里，也要多和群众接近，作家要多坐公共汽车、三轮车和电车，不要坐小汽车，这样你会观察到很多生活中的问题，不会脱离群众。因为周围都是劳动群众，这样，就有机会接近各行各业的人。有许多同志却不肯这样作。”他还说，文艺界同志有时看电影、观摩戏剧，只限于文艺圈，这是脱离群众的作法。知识分子有一个小圈子，不和群众接近，在文学上这是一种“自杀政策”。碧野在发言里，着重地谈了他最近去新疆深入部队生活的体会。白薇从自己下去生活的体验里，揭露了有的农场中领导人的官僚主义、脱离群众和严重地损害国家财产的现象（这一方面的材料，她正在写文章）。她还谈到，自己在东北体验生活受到歧视的情况。她说她在东北的一些农场里，领导人对下去的作家闭口不谈农场的事，无论怎样要求他们也不谈，他们说和写文章的人不好打交道。作家想到工作比较困难的地方去，他们也设法阻挠。她说，这种现象如果不纠正，将给作家深入生活造成很大困难。最后汪静之发言，针对目前培养作家问题提出了批评。
    因为时间的关系，到会的作家还有些没有来得及发言。邵荃麟说：这个座谈会开得很好。碧野同志谈得好，要把自己这根纱织到群众这匹布里去。他的经历可以写成很美的散文和小说，希望他写出来。今天来不及发言的同志，可以写成书面意见在人民日报发表。我相信这对作家和读者都是有益的。
