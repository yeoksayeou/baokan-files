People's Daily Shenyang, May 20th (by our reporter Jin Yukun): Up until May 19th, the Shenyang Daily, aside from some dynamic news reports that didn't touch upon specific contradictions and a few articles about study心得 (心得 xīn dé: what one has learned from work, study, etc.; knowledge gained; understanding), had remained silent on the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people. Even in the headlines of news stories and editorials, the words "bold"放 (fàng: to let go) and "bold"鸣 (míng: to speak out) were erased. Some comrades in the editorial department called their newspaper a shy and hesitant newspaper. Only in the last few days have they successively published some more detailed news about the放鸣 (fàng míng) in universities and colleges, but it still makes people feel that they are "striving for鲜花 (xiān huā: fragrant flowers; praise), fearing毒草 (dú cǎo: poisonous weeds; criticism)." This fear of放鸣 (fàng míng), fear of exposing contradictions, and fear of being passive actually reflects the leadership's ideology in the沈阳日报 (Shěnyáng Rìbào: Shenyang Daily) and some Party organizations in Shenyang. Ideological thinking lagging behind the development of the situation and lagging behind the masses outside the Party is a more common and pressing problem for many Party organizations in Shenyang.

Many non-Party members here, after studying Chairman Mao's report and reading the rectification instructions and the news reports about the放鸣 (fàng míng), were extremely encouraged and their thinking became very active; however, the leading personnel of some Party organizations felt very slow to react to this new situation and acted very slowly. Many non-Party members watched very carefully and studied very seriously, but some of our Party member leading cadres, although they also listened and watched, did not study well. Many non-Party members automatically organized themselves to discuss and contend, but the Party responsible comrades did not participate, lead, or support them. Therefore, some people said: "Why is spring so late in arriving here?" Non-Party members, especially senior intellectuals, are dissatisfied. Gao Xiuxian, associate professor at Shenyang Medical College, said: "All parts of the country have already exposed some internal contradictions, but Shenyang is slow to act - according to my subjective view, the leaders in the Shenyang area have concerns, as if their determination to correct mistakes is not great."

This situation is most concentratedly reflected in the recent problems at the Northeast Institute of Technology. This school had serious bureaucracy in the past. After the ideological remolding movement, all department heads (all of whom were old professors) were replaced by Party cadres who were not familiar with teaching. Since then, a large number of old professors have become depressed and silent. Although this specific problem has since been corrected, and the old professors have resumed their positions as department heads, some of the actual decision-makers are the Party secretaries in the departments, forming a situation in which secretaries lead the department heads. The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is extremely abnormal, especially since the former Party deputy dean Wang Zhili's subjective and rude style seriously hurt the self-esteem of many old teachers. At the same time, there were serious shortcomings in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the follow-up work was not done well. Therefore, in the situation where the whole country is放鸣 (fàng míng), many old teachers are eagerly demanding to release the words that have been suppressed in their hearts for a long time. However, the school's Party committee lacked sufficient assessment of this situation, and they still devoted all the Party committee's energy to leading students' study. Seeing the school leaders so indifferent, the teachers spontaneously organized forums and discussions. The teachers in the Mechanical Engineering Department held forums for two days, and their emotions were very enthusiastic. Everyone proposed to ask the Party committee secretary to participate, but the Party committee secretary was busy listening to the students' study reports and could not come. The teachers sent representatives to invite him, saying, "Even if you speak for five minutes, it's fine." The Party committee secretary had no choice but to agree, but he was not at all clear about the teachers' study situation in the past two days, and he was completely ignorant of their emotional demands. Therefore, he intended to simply explain to everyone: He really did not have time to participate, so you can study on your own. Therefore, his speech of twenty minutes was not very appropriate and was far from what everyone wanted. After he left, everyone's emotions were very agitated, and eighty-two teachers jointly signed a petition asking the First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee to support their争鸣 (zhēng míng: to contend). The next day, the Municipal Party Committee Secretary attended their forum and expressed his positive support, which basically satisfied everyone, but the Shenyang Daily did not mention the matter for two consecutive days, and they began to doubt the attitude of the Municipal Party Committee, so they sent representatives to meet the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. With the support of the provincial and municipal Party committees, all seven departments in the college launched放 (fàng) and鸣 (míng), and the leading personnel participated in the forums separately. The Party immediately announced rectification, checking and improving according to the problems exposed by everyone, and only then did this tense situation turn to normal.

Now, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has learned a lesson from the Northeast Institute of Technology and immediately arranged for the Party organizations of universities and colleges to shift to rectification, quickly and actively soliciting criticisms from non-Party members, and boldly and actively supporting放鸣 (fàng míng). Then, it convened a city-wide meeting of Party responsible cadres to carry out rectification mobilization, requiring a change in the current situation of the Party's leadership lagging behind in action and lagging behind the situation. In the past two days, many units have begun to organize forums, and the situation is gradually beginning to change.

    沈阳党组织不敢放手揭发矛盾
    市委接受教训开始主动征求党外人士意见
    本报沈阳20日电　本报记者金雨困报道：到5月19日为止的沈阳日报，除了仅有一些不触及具体矛盾的动态消息和几篇学习心得的文章外，这张报纸对于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题一直表现了缄默。甚至，在新闻和社论的标题中连“大胆”的放和“大胆”的鸣的字眼都被抹去。编辑部有些同志称自己的报纸是羞羞答答的报纸。直到最近几天，才陆续发表了一些较详细的大专学校放鸣的消息，但仍使人感到“力求鲜花，畏惧毒草”。这种怕放鸣、怕暴露矛盾、怕被动的思想实际上反映了沈阳日报和沈阳市的某些党组织的领导思想的状况。思想落后于形势的发展、落后于党外群众，这是沈阳市许多党组织较为普遍的迫切的问题。
    这里许多党外人士，学习了毛主席的报告和看了整风指示及报上的放鸣消息后，情绪极为鼓舞，思想大为活跃；而某些党组织的领导人员对这种新的形势却感觉十分迟钝，动作十分迟缓。很多党外人士看得很仔细，学得很认真，而我们某些党员领导干部虽也听了看了，但没有很好的看看学学。很多党外人士自动地组织起来讨论和争鸣，但党员负责同志也不去参加，也不领导也不支持，因此有人说：“此间春天何其迟迟”。党外人士，特别高级知识分子是不满意的。沈阳医学院副教授高秀贤说：“全国各地早已揭发了一些内部矛盾，唯独沈阳迟迟不动——据我主观的看法，沈阳地区的领导有顾虑，好像改正错误的决心不大”。
    这种情况最集中反映在东北工学院最近发生的问题上。这个学校过去有严重的官僚主义。在思想改造运动后曾将所有系主任（都是老教授）全部撤换，改由不熟悉教学的党员干部充任。从此大批老教授意志消沉，沉默寡言。这个具体问题以后虽有了纠正，老教授重新担任了系主任，但有的实际决策人却是系里的党员秘书，形成了秘书领导主任。党与知识分子的关系极不正常，特别是前党员副院长汪之力作风主观粗暴，严重地伤害了不少老教师的自尊心。同时在肃反中也有严重的缺点，善后工作也没有做好。因此在全国都在鸣放的形势下，很多老教师都急迫地要求把积压在心头的话放出来。而学校的党委对这种情况缺乏足够的估计，他们仍然把党委的全部精力投入领导学生的学习。教师们看着学校领导如此冷淡，就自发组织座谈讨论，机械系的老师们座谈了两天，情绪十分热烈，大家提议要求党委书记参加，而党委书记正忙于听学生学习汇报不能来。老师们又派代表去请，并说：“就是讲五分钟话也行”。党委书记没有办法才同意了，但他对教师们这两天学习的情况根本不清楚，对他们的情绪要求全然无知，因此去的打算只是想向大家解释一下：他实在没有时间参加，你们自己学就是了，因此去讲了二十分钟的话，讲得就不大得体，与大家的要求距离很大。他走后，大家情绪十分激动，八十二名教师就联名签字请沈阳市委第一书记来支持他们争鸣。第二天市委书记出席了他们的座谈会，并表示了积极支持的态度，大家基本上很满意，但沈阳日报却连续两天只字未提此事，他们对市委的态度又产生了怀疑，因此又派代表去见省委第一书记。在省市委支持下，全院七个系都展开了放、鸣，领导人员都分头参加了座谈会。党内立即宣布整风，根据大家揭发的问题，边检查、边改进，这样紧张的局面才转入正常。
    现在，中共沈阳市委接受了东北工学院这一教训，立即布置大专学校党组织转入整风，迅速主动征求党外人士的批评，大胆积极支持放鸣。接着又召开了全市党员负责干部进行整风动员，要求改变目前党的领导迟迟没有行动、落后于形势的局面。这两天来，有不少单位已开始组织座谈，情况正在开始逐渐转变。
