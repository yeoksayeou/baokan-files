    Beijing Summer Merchandise Can Basically Meet Needs
    Recently, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce conducted an inspection of the supply situation of its affiliated department stores, knitwear, clothing and footwear, medicine, and hardware machinery companies. The results of the inspection show that the supply of goods prepared for the second quarter of this year is generally much more sufficient than in the same period last year, and can basically meet the needs. For example, undershirts increased by 142%, vests increased by 94%, towel quilts increased by 34%, shirts increased by 45%, single-layer clothing increased by 150%, and other commodities such as leather shoes, casual shoes, rubber shoes, and soap have also increased. In terms of summer medicines, the Municipal Medicine and Medicinal Materials Company learned from last year's experience and prepared a large amount of summer medicines in advance this year. Civilian hardware such as round nails, wood screws, and iron pots can also basically meet the needs.
    However, some commodities are still not sufficient in individual varieties and specifications (such as women's white socks, cotton vests, light gray uniforms, women's floral shirts, short-sleeved shirts, leather sandals, white Lux shoes, etc.); the sizes of some commodities such as undershirts and vests are also not complete enough. In response, relevant companies are studying with industrial departments to increase production or increase transfers in order to meet the needs as much as possible. As for the very few daily commodities that are in short supply or lack raw materials, it is still difficult to achieve full supply, and each company will make reasonable supply according to the supply of goods and needs.

    北京夏令商品基本上可以满足需要
    最近，北京市商业局对所属百货、针棉织品、服装鞋帽、医药和五金机械等公司的货源情况进行了一次检查。从检查结果来看，今年第二季度准备的货源一般都比去年同期要充分的多，可以基本上满足需要。如汗衫增加142％、背心增加94％、毛巾被增加34％、衬衣增加45％、单服增加150％，其它如皮鞋、便鞋、胶鞋、肥皂等商品，也都有增加。在夏令药品方面，市医药和药材公司，接受了去年的教训，今年提前准备了大量的暑药。民用五金如元钉、木螺丝和铁锅等，也可以基本上满足需要。
    但是，也有些商品在个别品种规格上，还不够充足（如女白袜套、棉毛背心、浅灰制服、女花衬衣、短袖衬衣、皮凉鞋、白力士鞋等）；有的商品如汗衫、背心等的尺码也还不够齐全。对此，有关公司正在与工业部门研究增加生产或增加调进，尽可能做到满足需要。至于那些货源不足或原料短缺的极少数的日用商品，做到充分供应还有困难，也由各公司根据货源和需要情况，作到合理供应。
