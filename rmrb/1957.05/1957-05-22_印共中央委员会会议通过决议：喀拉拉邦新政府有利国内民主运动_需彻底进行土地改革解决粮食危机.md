Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st: The meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Delhi concluded on May 19th. The week-long meeting was the first held by the CPI Central Committee following the recent Indian general election.

A communique issued by the CPI headquarters on the evening of May 20th stated that, in reviewing the election, the Central Committee noted with satisfaction that the votes obtained by the CPI had doubled compared to the 1952 general election, and that the strength of the democratic opposition had increased in some states. The communique stated: "All this illustrates the progress of democratic and socialist forces."

The Central Committee also passed six resolutions. In the resolution on developing the party, the Central Committee decided to immediately launch a movement to double the number of party members (currently 125,000) by December of this year. The Central Committee also recommended certain organizational changes to strengthen party branches and to focus party activities on a regional basis, rather than solely on workplaces.

The Central Committee also passed a resolution congratulating the Communist-led government of Kerala on its establishment with the support and sympathy of the people of Kerala and the broad masses of people throughout India. The Central Committee believes that the success of this state government will help the continued growth and consolidation of the domestic democratic movement.

In a resolution, the Central Committee expressed its approval of the stance taken by the CPI Orissa State Committee in refusing to form a coalition government with the right-wing Democratic Congress Party in order to safeguard the interests of the people.

In another resolution, the Central Committee strongly protested the new tax proposals put forward in the budget. The Central Committee demanded that the Indian government extract money from the rich, rather than placing the burden on ordinary people.

In a resolution on the food situation, the Central Committee expressed serious anxiety about the food shortages in several states and the increasingly severe food crisis. The Central Committee stated that this crisis once again demonstrates the urgent need for thorough land reform. The committee also called for the opening of low-priced grain stores, the commencement of relief work, the exemption of land taxes, and the curbing of speculators.

During the Central Committee meeting, news arrived of the British government's hydrogen bomb test. The Central Committee passed a resolution condemning this action by Britain. The resolution welcomed the series of initiatives put forward by the Soviet government to reach an agreement on banning nuclear weapons.

CPI General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh told the Press Trust of India on the evening of May 20th that the CPI will concentrate its efforts in the coming months on launching movements against thermonuclear weapons testing, against new tax measures, and demanding solutions to the food problem. In addition, it will launch a nationwide movement in support of the Kerala government.

    印共中央委员会会议通过决议：
    喀拉拉邦新政府有利国内民主运动
    需彻底进行土地改革解决粮食危机
    据新华社新德里21日电　印度共产党中央委员会在德里举行的会议已经在5月19日闭幕。会议进行了一个星期，这是最近印度大选以后共产党中央委员会举行的第一次会议。
    印度共产党总部5月20日晚上发表公报说，中央委员会在回顾这次选举的时候，满意地注意到印度共产党所获得的票数比1952年大选中增加了一倍，而且有些邦中，民主反对派的力量有了加强。公报说：“所有这些说明了民主和社会主义力量的进展。”
    中央委员会还通过了六项决议。在关于发展党的决议中，中央委员会决定立即发动一次运动，争取到今年12月的时候党员的人数能增加一倍（目前的党员为十二万五千人）。中央委员会还建议实行某些组织上的改变，以便加强党的支部，并且着重把党的活动放在地区基础上，而不仅仅是放在工作地点的基础上。
    中央委员会还通过决议，祝贺共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府在喀拉拉邦人民和印度全国广大人民的支持和同情下建立起来了。中央委员会认为，这个邦政府的成功将有助于国内民主运动的继续增长和巩固。
    中央委员会在决议中表示，赞成印度共产党奥里萨邦委员会为了维护人民利益拒绝同右派民主大会党成立联合政府的立场。
    在另外一个决议中，中央委员会强烈地抗议在预算中提出的关于税收的新建议。中央委员会要求印度政府使富人拿出钱来，而不是把重担压在普通人民的身上。
    在关于粮食情况的决议中，中央委员会对好几个邦缺少粮食的情况和日益严重的粮食危机表示严重的焦虑。中央委员会说，这个危机再次说明迫切需要进行彻底的土地改革。委员会还要求开设廉价售粮店、开始救济工作、免征土地税和制止投机者。
    在中央委员会开会期间，传来了英国政府进行氢弹试验的消息。中央委员会通过决议，谴责英国这一行动。决议欢迎苏联政府为就禁止原子核武器达成协议所提出的一系列创议。
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士5月20日晚上向印度通讯社发表谈话说，印度共产党在今后几个月中，将集中力量展开反对热核武器试验、反对新赋税措施和要求解决粮食问题的运动，此外还将发起一个支持喀拉拉邦政府的全国规模的运动。
