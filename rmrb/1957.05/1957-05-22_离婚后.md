    Zhao Fengshan, a cadre from the security section of a machine factory, felt particularly happy as he returned home: because his wife, Hu Xiuying, had agreed to divorce him the previous evening. He hummed a Ping opera tune lightly and cheerfully as he entered the courtyard. Walking into the west room, he saw Hu Xiuying sitting on a chair, holding Bao’er in her arms, her head lowered in contemplation, tears having soaked the cuffs of her sleeves. She turned her face away when she saw Zhao Fengshan enter.

    Without sitting down, Zhao Fengshan said, "Put the child on the bed to sleep, and let's go to the district government to get the divorce certificate."

    Hu Xiuying slowly placed the child on the bed, gently put on her blue cotton coat, combed her short hair, and glanced back at the sleeping Bao'er before draping a kerchief over her head and walking out of the room with Zhao Fengshan, quietly closing the door behind her.

    The neighbors in the courtyard were all watching them from their doorways or windows.

    After leaving the gate, they walked their separate ways, neither looking at the other. Hu Xiuying's heart was breaking, and she trembled with anger.

    At this moment, Zhao Fengshan wished he could rush to the district people's committee, complete the divorce procedures, and get the divorce certificate so he could leave this "stinky stuff!"

    They quickly entered the district people's committee, and before long, they walked out, still going their separate ways.

    Zhao Fengshan, beaming with joy, held the certificate in his hand, puffed out his chest, and walked back, thinking that he could marry the typist, Little Zhang, in a day or two, and he felt a sweet sensation in his heart!

    Hu Xiuying, however, lowered her head, still recalling Zhao Fengshan's words in the district people's committee: "First, her marriage to me was arranged by our parents. Second, our personalities don't match. Third, she is uneducated and two years older than me. Finally, she doesn't understand what it means to be considerate! What is love! To take care of her, I will keep the child for now." These words rang in her ears and wouldn't go away. Yesterday, she still disagreed with giving Bao'er to Zhao Fengshan because the child was a piece of her flesh! Letting go of the child was like having someone cut a piece of flesh from her body. At night, she thought it over. Bao'er would hold her back, and she wouldn't be able to find work independently. But she couldn't bear to part with the child. She held Bao'er and sat on the chair for a whole night, painfully saying to the child, "Mom isn't heartless!"

    She dared not look up as she entered the courtyard, as if she had done something shameful, afraid that the neighbors would laugh at her. She silently lowered her head and walked into the room.

    Zhao Fengshan entered the room and sat on the chair by the window, tossing the divorce certificate onto the table, and then said nothing more.

    Hu Xiuying's eyes were fixed on Bao'er on the bed, seeing him sleeping sweetly, his apple-like face exposed outside the blanket. She gently touched the child's forehead, afraid that he had a fever, and then she gently opened the chest, taking out her own clothes. At the same time, she neatly placed the clothes that Zhao Fengshan would change into on the outside, and then she sorted Bao'er's clothes. She noticed that Bao'er's red bib was missing a button, so she took out a green button from the sewing box, found a needle and thread, and sewed the button on. Then she held up the bib and looked at it, tidied up the chest, and gently picked up her bundle, wrapped her kerchief around her head. She walked to Bao'er's bed and looked at Bao'er, the child turned over and went back to sleep, she covered the child with the blanket again, as if she was saying to the child, "Mommy is leaving!" She covered her nose with a handkerchief, two teardrops in her eyes, and stood at the door of the room. "Hmm! Bao'er's socks need to be changed, and the shoes I made for him, I forgot to put them on him because of the divorce." She hurried back to the chest, put down her bundle, opened the chest, and took out the newly patched socks and the newly made little flower shoes. She looked at the shoes, pulled on the shoe upper, lifted the blanket from under Bao'er's feet, gently took off Bao'er's old socks with her tender hands, put on the newly patched socks, and put on the little flower shoes for the child. She looked left and right, feeling the child's feet to see if they were comfortable.

    Zhao Fengshan impatiently glanced back at her, shook his head, and went back to looking at the divorce certificate on the table.

    Hu Xiuying covered Bao'er with the blanket again, then gently picked up her bundle and walked out of the room. Just as she was about to step down the steps, she suddenly remembered that the child had been coughing since the day before yesterday, and she had forgotten to give him the medicine she bought yesterday because of the divorce. Thinking this, she walked back into the room, put the bundle on the bed, and gently opened the drawer on the table, taking out the cough medicine from inside. She looked at the cough medicine and thought, "I know how to feed the child, but how can I tell him!" She looked at the medicine packet and saw that there were words on it. "Okay, let him see the words on top and he will know how to give the child the medicine!" She put the medicine packet in front of Zhao Fengshan, with the side with the words facing Zhao Fengshan. Zhao Fengshan impatiently pushed the medicine packet away with his hand. She looked at him, and anger surged up again, but she patted her chest and suppressed her anger. She looked back silently at the child, thinking, "I don't know what kind of stepmother this child will meet in the future!" At this thought, she covered her nose with a handkerchief again, and gently picked up her bundle, slowly retreating to the door of the room, saying to the child in her heart: "Bao'er! Mommy..." Just as she was about to continue, Bao'er suddenly woke up and shouted "Mama!" with a "wa" sound.

    Hu Xiuying lunged onto the bed in one stride, putting her face against Bao'er's face, and said with tears in her eyes, "Child! Mommy hasn't left!..."

    离婚后
    高延昌
    机器厂保卫科干事赵凤山，回到家中心里特别痛快：因为爱人胡秀英在昨天晚上，已经答应和他离婚。他轻松愉快地哼着评戏进了四合院。走进西房里，见胡秀英坐在椅子上，怀里抱住宝儿，若有所思地低着头，泪水湿了她的两支袖口。她见赵凤山进来就把脸扭过去了。
    赵凤山没有坐下就说：“把孩子放在铺上睡，咱两人到区政府领离婚证去。”
    胡秀英慢慢地把孩子放在铺上，轻轻地穿上蓝棉外衣，用梳子梳梳短发，回头看看睡着了的宝儿，她这才披上方巾，和赵凤山走出房门，回手轻轻地把门扣上。
    院里的街坊们，都守在自己门口或窗户上看他两人。
    出了门两人分开东西走着路，谁也没看谁一眼。胡秀英的心都要碎了，她浑身气得发抖。
    此时赵凤山恨不得一步走到区人民委员会，办好离婚手续，领了离婚证好离开这块“臭料！”
    他两人很快地走进区人民委员会，工夫不大，两个人由里边走出来，照旧各走各的。
    赵凤山喜气洋洋地，手里拿着证书，挺着胸脯子向回走，心里想着一两天就可以和打字员小张结婚了，他心里感到甜丝丝的美！
    而胡秀英低着头，还在回忆刚才在区人民委员会里赵凤山说的话：“第一，她和我是父母包办的。第二，性格合不来。第三，她没有文化，岁数比我大两岁。最后，她不懂什么叫体贴！什么叫爱情！我为了照顾她，所以先把孩子归我养着。”这些话挂在她的耳根子上跑不掉。昨天白天她还不同意把宝儿交给赵凤山，因为孩子是她身上的一块肉哇！丢开孩子就如同有人在她身上割了一刀子肉似的。晚上她想过来了。宝儿拖住她，她就不能独立找工作。丢开孩子她又舍不得，她抱住宝儿在椅子上整整坐了一宵，她痛心地对孩子说：“妈不是心狠呀！”
    她走进院里都不敢抬头，好像做了一件见不得人的事，怕街坊们笑话，她默默无言地低头走进屋里。
    赵凤山进屋就坐在靠窗户的椅子上，把离婚证书往桌上一扔说：“家里的东西你随便拿吧！”就再没有话了。
    胡秀英两眼看着铺上的宝儿，见他睡得甜甜的，在被子外只露着像苹果似的脸蛋，她轻轻用手摸一摸孩子的脑门，怕孩子发烧，然后她轻轻打开箱子，取出自己的衣服来。同时有条有理地把赵凤山要换的衣裳放在外边，把宝儿的衣裳又整理整理，她才发现宝儿的红围嘴丢了一个扣子，她又由针线匣里取出一个绿色扣子，找出针线就把扣子缝好了。然后她把围嘴又提起来看看，把箱里整理好了，这才轻轻地提着包袱，把方巾又围围。走到宝儿的铺跟前看看宝儿，孩子翻了个身又睡了，她又把被子给孩子盖了盖，好像她对孩子说：“妈妈走了！”她用手帕一捂鼻子，眼里含着两滴泪珠儿走到屋门口又站住了：“嗯！宝儿的袜子该换了，给他做的鞋，因为整天闹离婚忘了给他穿上。”她赶紧回到箱子跟前，放下包袱，打开箱子取出新补的袜子和新做的小花鞋，她看着鞋，用手拽拽鞋帮，把宝儿的脚底下被子掀开，用温柔的手轻轻地把宝儿的旧袜子脱下来，换上新补的袜子，给孩子又穿上小花鞋，她左看看，右瞧瞧地，用手摸摸孩子的脚舒展不舒展。
    赵凤山不耐烦地回头看了她一眼，把头一摆又去看着桌上的离婚证书。
    胡秀英又把被子给宝儿盖好，便轻轻地提起包袱走出屋门口。刚要下台阶，突然想起来，孩子由前天就咳嗽，昨天买的药由于离婚忘了给他吃。想着，她又走回屋里，把包袱放在铺上，轻轻地拉开桌上的抽屉，由里边取出咳嗽药。她看着咳嗽药心里想：“给孩子的吃法我知道，又怎么对他说呀！”她看看药包上有字：“好了，叫他看上边的字就知道怎么给孩子吃啦！”她把药包放在赵凤山的眼前，而且把有字的一面冲着赵凤山，赵凤山不耐烦地用手把药包推了推，她看着他气又涌上来，但她手抚摸着自己的前胸才把气压下去。回头默默地看着孩子，心里想：“不知道这孩子以后遇见一个什么样的后妈！”她想到此又用手帕一捂鼻子，才轻轻地提着包袱，慢慢地退到屋门口，心里对孩子说：“宝儿！妈妈……”她正要说下去，突然宝儿醒了，“哇”的一声喊：“妈妈！”
    胡秀英一个箭步趴在铺上，把脸挨在宝儿脸上，眼里含着泪说了声：“孩子！妈妈没走！……”
