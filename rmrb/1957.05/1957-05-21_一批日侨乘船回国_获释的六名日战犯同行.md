Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th: One hundred and twenty-nine Japanese nationals and their families returned to Japan this afternoon aboard the "Xingan Maru" ship.

Traveling with them to visit relatives in Japan were also five hundred and fifty-three Japanese women who had married Chinese men and their seven hundred and ninety-nine children.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The fourth group of six released Japanese war criminals returned to Japan on the "Xingan Maru" ship on the afternoon of the 20th. These war criminals are Hisayoshi Kanda, who was released on April 30th after serving his sentence, and Mitsuaki Kimura, Hideo Sakakibara, Kenjiro Funaki, Kyujiro Tai, and Torao Yoshifusa, who were released early on the 11th due to illness or good behavior during their imprisonment.

Seven family members who came to China to visit Japanese war criminals who are still serving their sentences also returned home on the same ship.

The remains of sixteen former Japanese soldiers, found in Guangdong by the Chinese Red Cross based on clues provided by Saburo Endo of the "Japanese Former Soldiers Visiting China Delegation" who visited our country last year, were also transported back to Japan this time.
