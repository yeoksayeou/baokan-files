Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 25th: TASS reported that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a letter to Soviet agricultural workers, calling on them to increase the number of sheep and wool production in the country by at least double in the next three years or so (the remaining years of the new five-year plan).

The letter to agricultural workers pointed out that although the Soviet Union's wool production has increased by 13% and the purchase volume of wool has increased by 25% in the past three years, the country still feels a shortage of wool. The letter to agricultural workers believes that the reason why this very important animal husbandry sector is lagging behind is that party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs have not given due attention to sheep raising.

The document suggests revising the previously formulated plans for increasing the number of sheep and wool production, making every effort to utilize all potentials to rapidly increase the number of sheep and wool production, and suggests that in the future, when measuring the sheep raising production achievements of developed collective farms, state farms, and districts, in addition to paying attention to the main indicators, attention should also be paid to the wool production per hundred hectares of agricultural land, as well as the amount of wool sheared per sheep and the output of other sheep raising products.

The CPC Central Committee and the Council of Ministers require that all issues related to the establishment of feed bases in the summer, especially during the winter, be resolved immediately, that work on improving pastures and mowing fields be widely carried out, and that sheep pens and greenhouses for winter grazing be built according to the existing number of livestock and the expected needs of young animals. In addition, the document also requires further improvement of sheep breeds, requiring the number of fine wool and semi-fine wool sheep in the country to be increased many times, requiring attention to be paid to the breeding of Karakul sheep in many areas in the southern part of the Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, and Kazakh Republics, and suggesting the widespread establishment of sheep breeding farms in various places.

    苏共中央和政府号召农业劳动者
    三年内增产羊毛一倍
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发表了告苏联农业劳动者书，号召他们在今后三年多时间内（新五年计划今后余下的年份）至少把全国羊的只数和羊毛产量增加一倍。
    告农业劳动者书指出，虽然在最近三年中苏联的羊毛产量增加了13％，羊毛的征购量增加了25％，但是，目前全国仍然感到羊毛不足。告农业劳动者书认为，这一十分重要的畜牧业部门之所以落后，是因为党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关对养羊业没有给予应有的重视。
    这一文件建议修改过去制定的关于增加羊只数目和羊毛产量的计划，尽可能地利用一切潜力来迅速增加羊只数目和羊毛的产量，并且建议今后在衡量养羊业发达的集体农庄、国营农场和区的养羊业生产成绩时，除了注意主要的指标之外，还应该注意一百公顷农业用地上羊毛的产量以及每只羊的剪毛量和养羊业其他产品的产量等指标。
    苏共中央和部长会议要求立即解决有关在夏季特别是在过冬时期建立饲料基地的一切问题，要求广泛地展开改良牧场和割草场的工作，并且按照现有牲畜头数和预计的仔畜的需要量来修建羊圈和冬季放牧的温室。此外，文件中还要求进一步改良羊的品种，要求使全国细毛羊和半细毛羊的只数增加许多倍，要求注意在乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克和哈萨克共和国南部许多地区内繁殖卡拉库尔羊，并且建议在各地广泛建立羊群育种场。
