Xinhua News Agency, May 26th -- Foreign news agencies report that the U.S. "Ambassador" to Taiwan, Rankin, held talks with Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon. After the meeting, Rankin told reporters that he had explained the U.S. position to Chiang Kai-shek, "making him understand the seriousness of the problem." Rankin repeatedly emphasized that this anti-American demonstration was "extremely serious and very bad." Rankin also said that he was "very shocked and indignant" at the anti-American demonstration, and scolded the Kuomintang authorities for being "very slow" in protecting the U.S. "Embassy" and Americans in Taipei. Rankin said menacingly that the police "apparently did not have tear gas" at the time, and now the United States has quickly supplied the Kuomintang police with tear gas.

During the talks, Rankin coerced Chiang Kai-shek to guarantee that he would "do his best to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future," and to punish the responsible Kuomintang officials, arrest Taiwanese residents, and compensate for the so-called U.S. "property losses."

Xinhua News Agency, May 26th -- According to foreign news agencies in Taipei: Chiang Kai-shek has dismissed three senior Chiang army officers in charge of public security in Taipei. Those dismissed were Huang Chen-wu, commander of the Chiang army's Taipei Garrison Headquarters, Liu Wei, commander of the Chiang army's military police headquarters, and Le Gan, director of the Taiwan Provincial Police Department.

Huang Chieh, commander-in-chief of the Chiang army, also assumed the position of commander of the Taipei Garrison Headquarters. The positions of commander of the military police and director of the police department were taken over by the original deputy commander and deputy director, respectively.

After the anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek returned to Taipei from his villa in Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan on the 25th to deal with the current situation.

Today is Sunday, and Peng Meng-chi, chief of staff of the Chiang army, ordered all Chiang army officers and soldiers to temporarily cancel their regular Sunday leave and stay in the camp or go to work as usual.
