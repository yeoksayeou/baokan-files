    In order to improve the work on the food front,
    The Party Committee of the Ministry of Food invites technicians to a rectification forum.
    (Our newspaper's report) On the 20th, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Food convened a forum for engineering and technical personnel. Gao Jinchun, the Party Committee Secretary, spoke first, hoping everyone would "speak their minds freely." Minister Zhang Naiqi then said: I once said that I, a non-Party minister, have authority and power, and my relationship with the Party is basically normal, but not without problems. I am one of the leaders of the Ministry of Food, therefore, I should also be among those being rectified. I hope everyone speaks enthusiastically and eliminates any concerns.
    Qi Ruoliang said: Party members have a special odor.
    Qi Ruoliang, an engineer at the Institute of Grain Science, said that the idea that Party members at the Ministry of Food consider themselves heroes is very serious. Whether in work or in dealing with people, they have a special odor. Many probationary Party members were still laughing and talking with the masses before becoming full members, but as soon as they became full members, they put on a stern face. Isn't this sectarianism at work? I have been the deputy director of the technical office for several years, but only in name.
    He also said that some cadres are improperly assigned. For example, Mr. Feng of the Grain Cadre School is very knowledgeable in warehouse pests, machinery, and medicine, and has taught in universities for more than ten years, but he only plays the role of a general cadre in the cadre school.
    Zhang Xiyang said: Non-Party comrades are also responsible for the sectarian phenomenon.
    Zhang Xiyang, an engineer at the Institute of Grain Science, said that the scientific research institute of the Ministry of Food is an institution in name only. We have discussed the organizational structure and nature of the work of the research institute and submitted it to the ministerial meeting for research, but there is no further news. In this case, how can the research institute lead the personnel of the grain department to advance towards science?
    He believes that non-Party comrades are also responsible for the sectarian phenomenon and cannot put all the blame on Party members.
    Chen Minju said: The "unified allocation" in the personnel system is likely to produce bureaucracy.
    Chen Minju, an engineer at the Design Institute of the Ministry of Food, said: The Party organization of the Ministry of Food helps intellectuals less and strikes more often, and some people are even afraid that intellectuals will not make mistakes. Party member section chiefs transferred from major regions are still section chiefs, but non-Party section chiefs cannot become section chiefs. The titles of Party member responsible cadres are officially announced through the personnel department, but the titles of non-Party comrades are not, so that they are "not justified in name, and their words are not justified" in their work. He believes that the "unified allocation" method adopted in the personnel system is very likely to produce bureaucracy.
    He said, "In the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" movement, I was struggled against. It was a mistake, but the leadership said that the "struggle" was not "wrong," which made me very sad.
    Sun Shizhong, an engineer at the Design Institute, said that there are many technicians in the Processing Bureau, and it is said that they are very idle, while other departments lack technicians. Why can't some people be transferred out?
    Chen Qizong, a teacher at the Grain Cadre School, said that the Ministry of Food's policy on training students at the cadre school is unclear. Currently, the students trained are "jacks of all trades." Yu Boyu said that Party and Youth League members account for the vast majority of the students trained by the cadre school. Can't non-Party cadres be trained?
    Gao Jinchun finally said that this forum will continue on the 21st. He also said: The problems raised by everyone will be resolved immediately if they can be resolved in a timely manner.

    为了改进粮食战线的工作
    粮食部党委邀请技术人员座谈整风
    本报讯　20日，中共粮食部党委会召开工程技术人员座谈会。党委书记高锦纯首先发言，希望大家“畅所欲言”。章乃器部长接着说：我曾经说过，我这个非党部长是有职有权的，和党的关系基本上是正常的，但并不是没有问题。我是粮食部的领导者之一，因此，我也应当属于被整风者之列。希望大家热烈发言，消除任何顾虑。亓若梁说：党员有特殊的气味
    粮食科学研究所工程师亓若梁说，粮食部党员以功臣自居的思想很严重，无论在工作上、在待人接物上都有特殊的气味。许多预备党员在转正之前同群众还有说有笑，一转正就板起面孔。这难道不是宗派主义在作怪吗？我在技术室当了好几年副主任，但一直是徒有其名。
    他还说，对有些干部安排不当。如粮食干部学校的冯先生在仓库害虫、药械等方面很有研究，在大学里教过十几年书，而他在干校只不过起了一般干部的作用。
    张锡羊说：造成宗派主义现象，非党同志也有责任
    粮食科学研究所工程师张锡羊说，粮食部的科学研究所是一个有名无实的机构。我们对研究所的组织机构和工作性质作过讨论，并提交部务会议研究，但无下文。这样，研究所又如何领导粮食部门的人员向科学进军呢？
    他认为造成宗派主义的现象，非党同志也有责任，不能全部推在党员头上。
    陈民驹说：人事制度上的“统一分配”很容易产生官僚主义
    粮食部设计院工程师陈民驹说：粮食部党组织对知识分子帮助少，打击多，甚至有人唯恐知识分子不犯错误。各大区调来的党员科长仍然是科长，非党科长就当不上科长了。党员负责干部的职名都通过人事部门正式公布，非党同志的职名却不如此，以致他们在工作上“名不正，言不顺”。他认为在人事制度上采用“统一分配”的办法，是很容易产生官僚主义的。
    他说，“肃反”运动中我曾被斗争，是弄错了；但领导上又说“斗争”没有“错”，这叫我很伤心。
    设计院工程师孙时中说，加工局的技术人员很多，据说很空闲；而其他部门却又缺乏技术人员。为什么不可以调出一些人员呢？
    粮食干部学校教员陈启宗说，粮食部对干校培训学员的方针不明确，目前培训出来的学员都是“万金油”。愈伯禹说，干校培训的学员中，党团员占绝大多数，是否非党干部就不能培养呢？
    高锦纯最后说，这个座谈会将在21日继续进行。他并且表示：大家提出的问题能及时解决的马上就予以解决。
