    At the Italian Socialist Party Central Committee Plenary Session
    Nenni Opposes Breaking with the Italian Communist Party
    (Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 11th) According to TASS, Rome: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni emphasized at the Socialist Party Central Committee Plenary Session held in Rome on May 9 that, although the Socialist Party believes that "its form of unity and organic connection with the Communists" is outdated, the Socialist Party "opposes all proposals to break with the Communists, and opposes abandoning cooperation with the Communists in cases where there is still agreement."
    Nenni gave a report on behalf of the Socialist Party Steering Committee at the Party Central Committee Plenary Session. This plenary session attached great importance to the question of relations between the two parties after the Socialist Party decided to reject merging with the Social Democratic Party on the latter's terms. According to the Italian progressive press, one of the reasons for the Social Democratic Party's withdrawal from the government was to lure the Socialist Party into rejecting cooperation with the Communists and merging with the Social Democratic Party.
    Nenni also pointed out in his report that the recent serious crisis in the matter of the merger of the Socialists was not only because the two sides had not found common ground, but also because, due to the fault of the Social Democrats, disagreements had arisen again on issues concerning contacts between the two parties, which had seemed to have been resolved.
    During the plenary session's discussion of Nenni's report, many speakers vehemently criticized the Social Democratic Party's position of attempting to split the working class and supporting the bourgeoisie.

    在意大利社会党中央全会上
    南尼反对和意共决裂
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利社会党领袖南尼5月9日在罗马举行的社会党中央全会上强调指出，尽管社会党认为“它同共产党人的团结形式和有机联系”已经过时，但是社会党“反对同共产党人决裂的一切建议，反对在意见一致的情况下仍然放弃同共产党人合作的一切建议”。
    南尼代表社会党指导委员会在党中央全会上作报告，这次全会十分重视在社会党决定拒绝按社会民主党的条件同这个党合并后两党关系的问题。据意大利进步报刊认为，社会民主党退出政府的原因之一，是为了引诱社会党拒绝同共产党人合作而同社会民主党合并。
    南尼在报告中还指出，近来在社会党人合并这件事上所以发生严重的危机，不仅是因为双方没找到接近之点，而且，由于社会民主党人的过失，就是在涉及两党接触的、看来已经解决的问题上又发生了分歧。
    在全会讨论南尼的报告的时候，许多发言的人都激烈地抨击了社会民主党企图分化工人阶级和支持资产阶级的立场。
