    Xinhua News Agency, May 10th. More than 400 women from all walks of life in Beijing discussed the question of why the supply of some commodities is currently tight at the Second Session of the Third Beijing Women's Congress.

    The women spoke very actively at the meeting. They agreed that the main reason for the current tight supply of some materials is that the growth of production cannot keep up with demand. However, they believe that the shortcomings in the work of commercial departments are serious, and much of the tension is man-made.

    They believe that the most serious shortcoming of commercial departments is insufficient planning. Sometimes there is too much of something, sometimes too little; there is too much in one place and too little in another. For example, with pork, it was impossible to buy it when queuing before the Spring Festival, but after the Spring Festival, there was a lot of it. On "May Day," some beef and mutton shops had meat that went bad because it could not be sold. Not long ago, there was no kelp to buy in the city, but many supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs had kelp stockpiled. Some time ago, there was a "gap" in the supply of vegetables, and the supply of bean sprouts was also insufficient; when vegetables were on the market in large quantities, bean sprouts were rushed out, resulting in a backlog and rotting of bean sprouts.

    The women said that the service attitude of some salespersons also artificially creates tension in the supply of goods. Some salespersons deliberately say: "If you don't like the goods, you won't be able to buy them tomorrow," "Buy them quickly, they will be gone if you don't"; some want to finish selling quickly, and they also encourage customers to buy more of goods that are relatively scarce. People in front of the line can buy a lot, and those behind the line cannot buy any.

    Some women raised concerns about the poor storage of goods. For example, the Guang'anmen vegetable station lost more than 660,000 yuan in the fourth quarter of last year due to the accumulation and spoilage of vegetables, and another 200,000 jin of vegetables rotted in the past two weeks. In some retail stores, the cabbage rots layer by layer, and becomes smaller and smaller as it is bought. Hou Xiuying, deputy director of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, said that when farmers pick cucumbers, they are afraid of knocking off the "thorns" and dare not put them in the basket, but carefully drape them on their arms. When they arrive at the commercial department, the "green" cucumbers are crushed into "yellow" cucumbers. Some women said that fresh live fish are not sold, but are sold after the price is set, and live fish become dead fish. Many housewives criticized, "They don't care because it's not their own." Hawkers' pears can be preserved for several months without spoiling, but fruits in state-owned stores rarely do not rot; the vegetables on the hawkers' carts are clean and tidy, but the vegetables in the retail stores are a mess; the hawkers cover the vegetables with cotton cloth in winter, but the cabbage in the retail stores is frozen in large piles.

    The women believe that the blind scramble for goods by many people also creates artificial tension, and they hope that the government will strengthen education for these people. Many housewives reflect that some people buy things they do not need. Some people buy a lot of sesame paste at one time, and it grows moldy at home because they cannot finish eating it, but some people cannot buy it. Some housewives pointed out that there are now a group of children on the streets who specialize in queuing. Hiring a child to queue up to buy things costs one dime each time. The women suggested that the method of rationing major daily necessities such as pork and white sugar should be changed to reduce the phenomenon of queuing and scrambling for purchases.

    The women also suggested establishing organizations to supervise commercial departments among street residents. This organization should provide timely criticism or suggestions on the shortcomings in the work of commercial departments, and also help commercial departments to carry out publicity work to the masses.

    The meeting lasted for four days and adjourned on the 9th. The meeting also elected representatives to attend the National Women's Congress and discussed issues related to the enrollment and employment of secondary school graduates and other women's work.

  面帮助商业部门克服缺点，一面向群众进行宣传。
    新华社10日讯　北京四百多位各界妇女在北京市第三届妇女代表大会第二次会议上讨论了目前有些商品供应为什么紧张的问题。
    妇女们在会上的发言非常活跃。她们同意目前一部分物资供应紧张的主要原因是生产的增长赶不上需要。但是她们认为，商业部门工作中的缺点是严重的，有不少紧张是人为的。
    她们认为，商业部门最严重缺点是计划性不够。有些东西忽多忽少，这里多那里少。如猪肉，春节前排队买不上，春节后又很多。“五一”那天，有的牛羊肉铺因卖不完肉都臭了。有一阵城里买不到海带，而郊区不少供销社却有海带积压。不久以前蔬菜“青黄不接”，豆芽也供应不足；等到蔬菜大批上市，豆芽才赶泡出来，形成了豆芽积压腐烂。
    妇女们说，有些售货员的服务态度也是人为地造成商品供应紧张的原因。有的售货员故意说：“你嫌货不好，明天还买不到哩”，“快买吧，不买就没有了”；有的是想赶紧销完完事，比较缺的货也动员顾客多买，排在前面的人可以买得很多，排在后面的就买不到了。
    有的妇女对商品保管不善提出了意见。例如广安门菜站由于蔬菜积压腐烂，去年第四季度赔了六十多万元，前两个星期又烂了二十万斤菜。有些零售商店的洋白菜一层一层烂掉，越买越小。东方红农业社副主任侯秀英说，农民摘黄瓜时，怕把“刺”碰掉，不敢搁在筐里，小心地搭在胳膊上。到了商业部门，“绿”色的黄瓜，给压成 “黄”瓜了。有的妇女说，新鲜的活鱼不卖，等定了价再卖，活鱼变成了死鱼。许多家庭主妇批评说， “不是自己的东西不心疼”。小摊贩的鸭梨可以保存好几个月不坏，国营商店里的水果很少有不烂的；小摊贩菜车上的菜清清爽爽，零售商店的菜却不成样子；小摊贩冬天用棉布盖菜，零售商店的白菜却大堆冻坏。
    妇女们认为，不少群众盲目争购，也造成了人为的紧张，希望政府对这些人加强教育。许多家庭主妇反映，有些人不需要的东西也购买。有的人买芝麻酱一买就是很多，吃不完放在家里长了毛，但有些人却买不到。有些主妇指出，现在街道上还出现了一批专门排队的儿童，雇一个儿童排队买东西一次一毛钱。妇女们建议把猪肉、白糖等主要日用品改成定量供应的办法，排队争购的现象就会减少。
    妇女们还建议在街道居民中建立监督商业部门的组织，这个组织一方面及时给商业部门工作中的缺点提出批评或建议，一方面又可帮助商业部门对群众进行宣传工作。
    这次会议开了四天，9日已经休会。会议还选出了出席全国妇代会的代表，讨论了中小学毕业生升学就业和其他妇女工作方面的问题。
