Xinhua News Agency, May 24th -- The French Radical Socialist Party Faces New Split
Mendès-France Resigns Leadership Post

    According to Xinhua News Agency on May 24th, former French Prime Minister Mendès-France announced on the 23rd that he had decided to resign from his position as first vice-chairman of the Radical Socialist Party in protest against the fact that the party's members of parliament, although undisciplined in the National Assembly's vote of confidence in the Mollet government on the 21st, were not penalized.
    At the Radical Socialist Party's executive committee meeting that day, Mendès-France requested that the two members of parliament who voted to support the Mollet government be expelled from the party. However, his proposal was rejected by a vote of seventeen to fifteen.
    His resignation this time is the result of serious divisions within the Radical Socialist Party. Since Mendès-France won actual leadership of the Radical Socialist Party two years ago, the party has experienced two splits, with former Prime Ministers Faure, Queuille, and others leaving the Radical Socialist Party successively.
    Mendès-France's resignation is still subject to approval by the party's full executive committee meeting on June 14th.

### 法国激进社会党面临新分裂  孟戴斯—弗朗斯辞去领导职务

    法国激进社会党面临新分裂
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯辞去领导职务
    据新华社24日讯　法国前总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯23日宣布，他决定辞去激进社会党第一副主席的职务，以抗议这个党的议员在21日国民议会对摩勒政府投信任票的时候虽然不守纪律却不受处分的现象。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯在当天的激进社会党执行委员会会议上要求把投票支持摩勒政府的两名议员开除出党。但是他的提案以十七票对十五票被否决了。
    他这次辞职是激进社会党内的严重分歧发展的结果。自从两年前孟戴斯—弗朗斯赢得对激进社会党的实际领导权以来，这个党已经经历了两次分裂，前总理富尔、葛义等人都先后脱离了激进社会党。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的辞职还有待6月14日举行的该党执行委员会全体会议的批准。
