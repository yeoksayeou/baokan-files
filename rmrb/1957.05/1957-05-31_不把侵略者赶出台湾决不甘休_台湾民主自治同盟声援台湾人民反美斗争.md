Xinhua News Agency, May 30th – The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL) and its Beijing Municipal Branch held a forum in Zhongshan Park today to express support for the patriotic anti-American struggle of the compatriots in Taiwan.

TDSL Chairman Xie Xuehong spoke first at the meeting. She said that the current anti-American struggle of the Taiwan compatriots is different from the "February 28th" Incident. This anti-American struggle has great significance internationally. Today's motherland is also stronger than it was during the "February 28th" Incident. We must warn American imperialism that the people of Taiwan will not yield, and they will never give up until they drive the aggressors out.

Chen Bingji, Chairman of the TDSL Beijing Municipal Branch, said that the patriotic anti-American demonstration of the Taiwan compatriots once again shows that the people of Taiwan are unwilling to be enslaved by the American aggressors, and the people of Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

Huang Yongren, a TDSL member working at the Beijing Stomatological Hospital, said that the anti-American demonstration of the Taiwan people is a sign that the rule of the US imperialists in Taiwan is coming to an end. He also expressed his condolences to Liu Ziran's wife and his respect to the doctors who treated the injured compatriots in Taiwan.

Tian Fuda (Gaoshan ethnicity), a member of the TDSL Central Committee and a deputy to the National People's Congress, said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique not only failed to avenge the compatriots killed by the American aggressors, but instead compensated the aggressors for their losses. This is shameful and violates the interests of the Chinese people.

More than 150 people attended the forum.

    新华社30日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京市支部今天在中山公园举行座谈会，声援台湾同胞的爱国反美斗争。
    台盟主席谢雪红首先在会上发言。她说，台湾同胞这次反美的斗争和“二·二八”斗争不同，这次反美的斗争在国际上具有很大的意义。今天的祖国也比“二·二八”斗争时的祖国强大了。我们要警告美国帝国主义，台湾的人民是不会屈服的，他们不把侵略者赶出去决不甘休。
    台盟北京市支部主任委员陈炳基说，这次台湾同胞的爱国反美大示威，又一次表明台湾人民不甘心受美国侵略者的奴役，台湾人民一定要早日回到祖国的怀抱。
    在北京市口腔医院工作的台盟盟员黄永仁说，这次台湾人民反美大示威，是美帝国主义者在台湾统治将要完蛋的预兆。他并向刘自然的妻子表示慰问，向给台湾的受难同胞治伤的医生表示敬意。
    台盟中央委员、全国人民代表大会代表田富达（高山族）说，蒋介石集团不仅不为被美国侵略者杀死的同胞报仇，反而向侵略者赔偿损失，这是可耻的，违背了中国人民的利益。
    参加这次座谈会的有一百五十多人。
