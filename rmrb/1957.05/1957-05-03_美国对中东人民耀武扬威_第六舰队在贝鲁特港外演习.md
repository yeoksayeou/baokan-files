Xinhua News Agency report: The United States Sixth Fleet, with fifty warships, continued its exercises off the port of Beirut, Lebanon, on May 1, intimidating the people of the Middle East. The exercises began on April 30. More than a hundred aircraft taking off in shifts from aircraft carriers were loaded with rockets and live ammunition. The fleet's cannons were engaged in "target practice." The main force of this fleet was only a hundred miles from Beirut and extremely close to Jordan, where the U.S.-engineered political events were taking place. Batches of U.S. Marines drove around the streets of Beirut in six-ton trucks on May 1. Approximately two thousand U.S. sailors and Marines landed in Beirut on the occasion of the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Fitr, making a show of force. U.S. Sixth Fleet Commander Brown once again threatened on May 1 that he was ready to deal with all events in the Middle East, from small conflicts to all-out war.

In coordination with these U.S. actions, Turkey is also deploying troops. According to the Istanbul newspaper "Yeni Istanbul," Turkish infantry, motorized units, and armored forces are gathering on the Syrian border.

The newspaper said that the Fifth Armored Brigade had moved to the South Anatolian region near the border. It said that recently, large numbers of troops have passed through Adana, heading towards Urfa-Gaziantep, and "military exercises" will be held in South Anatolia near the Syrian border. The Director of Public Relations for the Turkish Army, Tanriöver, did not deny this news.

These intimidating actions by the United States have aroused opposition from all sides. The Central Committee of the Indonesian Plantation Workers Union and the Public Works Union sent a letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia. The letter said that the tense situation in Jordan was caused by the United States' blatant interference in Jordan's internal affairs. The United States' attempt to use force to impose the Eisenhower Doctrine is a violation of the United Nations Charter and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. The letter demanded that the United States immediately stop its intervention in the Middle East, especially in Jordan.

The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" said that the United States' deployment of the Sixth Fleet, with the intention of using the navy to achieve diplomatic goals, surpasses the entire history of "Pax Britannica." The Labour Party's "Daily Mirror" said: The commander of the Sixth Fleet called the mission of landing nine hundred U.S. Marines in Beirut "a purely friendly visit." "Who would easily believe such ridiculous nonsense?" "If nine hundred Soviet soldiers landed in Haiti in the West Indies, what would Dulles say?... Would he regard this as a purely friendly visit?"

### 美国对中东人民耀武扬威  第六舰队在贝鲁特港外演习

    美国对中东人民耀武扬威
    第六舰队在贝鲁特港外演习
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：美国第六舰队的五十艘军舰5月1日在黎巴嫩的贝鲁特港外继续进行恫吓中东人民的演习。这次演习是在4月30日开始的。从航空母舰上轮番起飞的一百多架飞机都装上了火箭和真正的弹药。舰队的大炮作着“打靶练习”。这个舰队的主力离开贝鲁特只有一百英里，距离在美国策动下发生政治事变的约旦也极近。成批的美国海军陆战队员5月1日乘着六吨重的汽车在贝鲁特的街道上来回奔驰。大约有二千名美国水兵和海军陆战队员在黎巴嫩穆斯林庆祝开斋节的时候在贝鲁特登岸作示威姿态。美国第六舰队司令布朗5月1日再次威胁说，他已经准备好应付中东的一切事变，从小冲突直到全面战争。
    和美国这种行动相配合的是土耳其的调兵遣将，据伊斯坦布尔“新时报”报道，土耳其步兵、摩托化部队和装甲部队正在叙利亚边境集结。
    这家报纸说，第五装甲旅已经开向靠近边境的南阿那托里亚地区。它说，最近有大批军队经过亚达那向乌尔法—加西恩塔普方向进发，在南阿那托里亚靠近叙利亚边境的地方将举行“军事演习”。土耳其陆军公共关系局局长坦里欧佛没有否认这种消息。
    美国这种恫吓行动，已引起各方面的反对。印度尼西亚种植园工人工会和公共工程工会的中央委员会把一份抗议信送给美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆。抗议信说，约旦的紧张局势是美国公然干涉约旦内政所引起的。美国企图通过武力强迫接受艾森豪威尔主义，这种行动是违背联合国宪章和万隆会议精神的。抗议信要美国迅速停止对中东特别是对约旦的干预。
    英国保守党的“每日电讯报”说，美国调动第六舰队的有意用海军来达到外交目的的做法超过了“不列颠统治下的和平”的全部历史。工党的“每日镜报”说：第六舰队总司令把九百名美国海军陆战队在贝鲁特登陆的任务称做“一次纯粹友好的访问”，“谁会轻信这种可笑的莫名其妙的话呢？”“如果九百名苏联士兵在西印度群岛的海地登陆，杜勒斯会说些什么呢？……难道他会把这个看作是一次纯粹友好的访问吗？”
