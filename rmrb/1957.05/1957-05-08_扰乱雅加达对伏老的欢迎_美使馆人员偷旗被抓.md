Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th - During the warm welcome given to Chairman Voroshilov by the people of Jakarta, an American was caught by Jakarta citizens for stealing Indonesian and Soviet flags.

Early on the morning of the 6th, this American secretly took down the Indonesian and Soviet flags that had been put up on the street to welcome Chairman Voroshilov. As he was holding the flags he had stolen, three Indonesian youths who were passing by told him to stop, but he turned and ran, jumping over a barbed wire fence and a wall. The Indonesian youths chased after him and finally caught him and took him to the police station. The American has now been transferred to the Jakarta Garrison Command.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" said that the American is a member of the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia's military attache's office. The Jakarta Garrison Command has notified the U.S. Embassy of this incident.

Today, the United States Information Service admitted that a staff member of the U.S. Embassy was detained by the police for tearing down flags. The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, has expressed his apologies to the Indonesian Foreign Minister regarding this incident.

The "People's Daily" said that this flag-stealing activity is closely related to disrupting the preparations for welcoming Voroshilov.

A spokesman for the Jakarta Garrison Command said that the military has taken strict precautions regarding rumors that disruptive groups would take the opportunity to cause trouble when Voroshilov came to Jakarta. The three armed forces and the police have implemented joint patrols, and several armored vehicles have also been deployed.

    扰乱雅加达对伏老的欢迎
    美使馆人员偷旗被抓
    据新华社雅加达7日电　在雅加达人民热烈欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席时，一个美国人因为偷窃印度尼西亚和苏联国旗被雅加达市民捉住。
    6日早上三点多钟，这个美国人在街上偷偷地拿下为欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席而挂起的印度尼西亚和苏联国旗。在他手里还拿着偷卸下来的旗帜的时候，路过的三个印度尼西亚青年叫他站住，但是他掉头就跑，跳过了一道铁丝网和越过了一道围墙。印度尼西亚青年紧紧地追赶，终于把他抓住，并且把他送到警察局。现在这个美国人已经被转送到雅加达卫戍司令部。
    雅加达“人民日报”说，这个美国人是美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆武官处的人员。雅加达卫戍司令部已经把这件事通知美国大使馆。
    美国新闻处今天承认，美国大使馆的一名职员由于扯下旗帜被警察扣留。美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊已经就这一事件向印度尼西亚外交部长表示歉意。
    “人民日报”说，这种偷旗活动和扰乱欢迎伏罗希洛夫的筹备工作有密切关系。
    雅加达卫戍司令部发言人说，对于传说扰乱集团要在伏罗希洛夫来雅加达时乘机扰乱这件事，军方已经采取了严密的预防措施，三军和警察已经实行了联合巡逻，还出动了几辆装甲车。
