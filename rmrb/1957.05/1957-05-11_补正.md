    Xu Deheng's Statement
    In the May 9th newspaper, it was published that I said members of the Jiusan Society requested to withdraw from the society after joining the Communist Party. I did not say that. I said that some members, after joining the Communist Party, wanted to withdraw from the work of the Jiusan Society and were unwilling to continue serving as chairmen of branch committees, etc. I think it is welcome that they can participate in the Communist Party. Our comrades are encouraged, and if they continue to serve in the Jiusan Society, they can give even greater help to the Jiusan Society.
    Wang Kunlun's Letter
    In my speech at the symposium of responsible persons of various democratic parties and non-party democrats on May 9 (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 10th), I said: "Some members of democratic parties in government organs have positions, powers, and responsibilities, but many people have positions and responsibilities but not enough power." The wording in various newspapers does not fully conform to the original meaning and should be corrected with a statement.
    Tan Zhiqing's Letter
    Regarding my speech on the 9th (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 10th), a passage was published as "For example, the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) now has 120 local organizations, of which... They are difficult to solve. Therefore..." This differs from the original speech. The original speech was: "For example, the CDNCA now has 140 local organizations, including more than 20 directly subordinate units. When they encounter difficult problems that cannot be solved, they constantly write letters to the CDNCA Central Committee for solutions. Therefore..." Please correct it accordingly.
    Zhang Jiyu's Letter
    After reading Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun of the China Democratic League's speech at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee in the May 9th People's Daily, it mentioned, "For example, a section chief in a certain agency, because he is not a Party member, cannot participate in relevant meetings convened by the State Planning Commission that he should attend, and feels very distressed." This passage is probably based on my speech at the symposium held by the League Central Committee. After the meeting, I found that I had misheard this matter. Please correct it specifically. However, the situation where non-Party members cannot participate in or be involved in the handling of some meetings convened by some administrative agencies or the processing of certain work does exist.

    许德珩的申明
    9日的报上，登出我说九三学社社员加入共产党后要求退社。我不是那样说的。我说有些社员在他们加入了共产党以后，就要退掉九三学社的工作，不愿再担任分社主任委员等等。我认为他们能够参加共产党，是值得欢迎的，我们的同志都受到鼓舞，而且，他们如果继续担任九三学社的工作，还可以对九三学社有更大的帮助。

    5月9日在各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士座谈会上，我发言中（见10日本报第二版）说到：“在政府机关中有的民主党派成员是有职有权有责的，但也有许多人是有职有责而权不够的”。各报所载文字，不尽符合原意，应当声明更正。
    谭志清来信
    关于我9日发言（见10日本报第二版）中有一段刊载为“比如，民建现在有一百二十个地方组织，其中……他们都很难解决。因此……”与原发言有出入。原发言词为：“比如，民建现有一百四十个地方组织，其中直辖单位也有二十多个，他们遇有困难问题不能解决时，不断向民建中央写信要办法。因此……”请代更正为感。

    读了9日人民日报载民盟章伯钧副主席在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上的发言，其中提到“例如某机关的一个计划科长，因为是非党员，不能参加国家计划委员会召开的他本应参加的有关会议，很感苦恼。”一段，大概是根据我在盟中央召开的座谈会上的发言而谈的。会后，我发现这件事是我听错了，特请更正。不过，某些行政机关召开的一些会议或进行处理某些工作，非党员不能参加或不能参与处理的情况是存在的。
