Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Huadong, Wei Ding, and Lü Xilin report: Leaders of some factories and enterprises in Chongqing earnestly hope that the central ministries and bureaus in charge will improve their working methods, working style, and streamline their massive management organizations during this rectification campaign.

Regulations are Made Subjectively and Forced to be Implemented

The Communist Party secretaries and factory directors of Chongqing Power Plant, Chongqing Water Turbine Factory, and No. 610 Textile Dyeing Factory generally reflected that some regulations and systems formulated by higher authorities do not proceed from reality and are forced to be implemented, which deepens the internal contradictions of the enterprises. According to the training system regulations of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, graduates of technical schools with a study period of one or two years can formally assume important positions such as stokers, drivers, and team leaders after half a year of internship. When this training requirement of turning out level four or five workers in one and a half years was passed down to the factory, it caused great unease in the factory. A ball mill driver with twenty-five years of service in the factory is only a level four worker, and a water supply worker with twelve years of service is only a level five worker. After the factory repeatedly requested changes from higher authorities, the ministry and bureau in charge still insisted on the subjective decision that after half a year of internship, workers should not be lower than level two.

The wage grade lines determined by the central ministries and bureaus in charge have also produced many new unreasonable phenomena after implementation. There are many opinions between workers and between cadres and workers, which brings many difficulties to the factory.

Called for Repeatedly But Doesn't Come Down

The factories in Chongqing generally feel that the central ministries and bureaus in charge do not go deep enough into the lower levels to help solve difficulties in a concrete way. The director of the Water Turbine Factory reflected that the Fourth Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry manages a total of a dozen factories, with three or four bureau chiefs. If a bureau chief only visited a few factories a year, the bureau chief has never been to Chongqing. When going to the ministry for a meeting this year, he repeatedly requested the bureau chief to come and see the Chongqing Water Turbine Factory, but the bureau believed that the ministry wanted to do systematic analysis and research work this year and would not go down to the factories. In the past, people from the ministry and bureau always went to large and new factories, and had a very poor understanding of the situation of general old factories. Now there are two department heads who have stayed in Chongqing for more than a month and have not been to the Third Iron and Steel Plant once. The leaders of this factory said, is it because there is a Jialing River separating them, the riverbank is too high, and the car cannot reach directly and has to climb a slope?

Massive Organization and Inefficient Work

The leaders of the factories generally hope to streamline the massive management organization, improve work efficiency, and change the current procrastination style. The products of the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory have been inspected and qualified by the responsible bureau and packaged, and they could be shipped, but they cannot be shipped without a certificate of qualification. It turns out that the inspectors have to go back to Beijing to fill in the certificate of qualification, and then mail it back. In this way, the products are unreasonably kept in the warehouse for several months, affecting the completion of the factory's financial plan. Due to the large organization of the central ministries and bureaus in charge, the solution of a matter often takes this form: the bureau chief does not make a decision personally, this office pushes it to that office, and finally it may return to the bureau chief; some problems cannot be decided by the responsible bureau and have to be returned to the department to decide. The large organization not only takes time for official correspondence, but also when the factory directors go to Beijing in person, they deeply feel that the government office is large and it is difficult to find people.

### 各地工厂企业领导人员殷切希望  清除中央主管部的官僚主义

    各地工厂企业领导人员殷切希望
    清除中央主管部的官僚主义
    重庆各厂批评电力、纺织、冶金等部：
    本报特约稿　新华社记者王华东、韦丁、吕希林报道：重庆市部分工厂企业领导干部，殷切希望中央主管部、局在这次整风中，改进工作方法、工作作风和精简庞大的管理机构。
    规章订得主观偏要强迫执行
    重庆发电厂、重庆水轮机厂和六一零纺织染厂的中共党委书记和厂长们普遍反映，有些上级制定的规章制度，不从实际出发，强迫执行，加深了企业内部的矛盾。根据电力工业部的培养制度规定，学习期限一、二年的技工学校毕业生，经过半年实习，便可正式担任司炉、司机、班长等重要职务。这个一年半培养成四、五级工的培训要求，下达到厂，便引起厂里很大不安。厂里有二十五年工龄的球磨机司机，不过是四级工，十二年工龄的司水才五级。经厂方再三向上级要求改变，但是主管部局仍坚持半年实习后不得低于二级工的主观决定。
    中央主管部局决定的工资等级线，执行以后也产生了许多新的不合理的现象。工人与工人之间，干部与工人之间的意见很多，给厂里带来很多困难。千呼万唤不下来
    重庆各厂普遍感到中央主管部局深入下层，具体帮助解决困难太少。水轮机厂厂长反映，第一机械工业部第四工业局一共管十几个厂，三、四个局长，一个局长一年只要跑几个厂，但局长一次也没有来过重庆。今年去部里开会，再三请求局长到重庆水轮机厂来看看，但是局里认为今年部里要做系统的分析研究工作，不下厂。过去部里、局里的人都往大厂、新厂跑，对一般旧厂情况了解很差。现在有两个司长，在重庆市住了一个多月，没有到第三钢铁厂去过一次。这个厂的领导人员说，是不是隔了一条嘉陵江，河岸太高，汽车不能直达，要爬坡？
    机构庞大办事不灵
    各厂领导普遍希望精简庞大的管理机构，提高工作效率，改变目前的拖拉作风。重庆机床厂的产品经主管局派人检验合格，包装完毕，本可出厂，但缺少检验合格证不能出厂。原来检验人员要回到北京才能填合格证，填好后再寄来。这样产品便毫无道理地被积压在仓库里，竟达几个月之久，影响厂里财务计划的完成。由于中央主管部、局机构庞大，往往一件事情的解决形成这样的情况：局长不亲自做决定，这个处推给那个处，最后也许又回到局长那里；有些问题，主管局还不能决定，要退还司里去决定。机构庞大，不仅公文往来费时，就是厂长们亲身到北京，也深深感到衙门大，不好找人。
