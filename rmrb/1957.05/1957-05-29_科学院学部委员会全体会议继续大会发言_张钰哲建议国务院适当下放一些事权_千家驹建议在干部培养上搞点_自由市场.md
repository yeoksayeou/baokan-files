    Academy of Sciences Academic Committee Plenary Session Continues with Speeches
    Zhang Yuzhe Suggests the State Council Appropriately Delegate Some Powers
    Qian Jiaju Suggests Introducing a "Free Market" in Cadre Training
    (Our dispatch) The second plenary session of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Academic Committee continued its general session speeches on the 28th.
    The chemist Wang You's speech was entitled "Speaking Out for Overseas Students," in which he used the experiences of three overseas students as examples, saying that Zhuang Yahui, an overseas student, was sent by the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the Soviet Union in 1955 to study high-pressure organic synthesis. After waiting idly in Moscow for more than a year, he was assigned by the Overseas Students Management Office of our Embassy in the Soviet Union to Moscow University as a graduate student. The person in charge of the relevant department persuaded the young man three times to change his major, and finally persuaded him to study radiochemistry. May I ask, how far apart are radiochemistry and high-pressure organic synthesis? Finally, he appealed: I hope the relevant party and non-party leading comrades will not forget the thousands of students living abroad and cherish our future precious pillars in the scientific march. Act quickly to find ways to solve the troubles and difficulties caused by past subjectivism and bureaucracy for them and future young overseas students, and prevent the emergence of new similar problems.
    The mathematician Wang Xianghao talked about the problem of overall consideration and appropriate arrangement of scientific and cultural personnel. He pointed out that due to the unreasonable standards for evaluating positions and wages, some people understand giving full play to one's abilities as "all other professions are base, only studying is noble"; moreover, they understand the so-called only studying being noble as only papers being noble. Thus, "giving full play to one's abilities" becomes "giving full play to one's abilities to desperately write papers," and "distribution according to work" becomes "distribution according to papers." He suggested that in the future, the standard for evaluating positions should be based on both virtue and talent, regardless of seniority; the standard for wages should be based on talent and seniority, regardless of morality. He said that the reason is very simple: to hold a position, one must be basically competent and have a correct work style and be active in work. This is the standard of virtue and talent. Why not ask about seniority? Old age and long service do not necessarily mean competence. However, the assessment of wages is different. Wages must take into account seniority, and hard work cannot be ignored. Wang Xianghao also talked about who should be respected and the overall arrangement of living standards.
    The astronomer Zhang Yuzhe suggested that the State Council delegate power. He said that the State Council must take charge of coordinating and balancing the work plans between research institutions and higher education and industrial departments. As for some of the Academy of Sciences' own problems, the seven presidents, eight secretary-generals and hundreds of academicians of the Academy of Sciences could use their brains to make decisions.
    In his speech, the chemist Lu Jiaxi requested that the Academy of Sciences strengthen scientific research in border areas; gradually strengthen the academic activities of specialized societies to understand the academic trends in various regions of the country and organize academic forums in a healthier way.
    The chemist Yuan Hanqing criticized the work of the Academy of Sciences for having three major shortcomings: the Academy of Sciences has not been able to become a good staff department of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee to lead the national scientific work; the research work within the Academy of Sciences has not been able to focus on the trend of world scientific development as much as possible; the Academy of Sciences has not yet made scientists across the country feel that it is the Academy of Sciences of scientists across the country.
    In his speech, the economist Shen Zhiyuan first mentioned the issue of strengthening the cooperation of the research forces of the three systems of the Academy of Sciences, universities and industrial departments. He suggested that scientists in the three systems can concurrently conduct research or teaching work on a voluntary basis. At the same time, the government should conduct a comprehensive investigation of scientific research personnel who are scattered in various aspects and inappropriately arranged, so that they can return to their respective teams.
    The economist Qian Jiaju suggested introducing a "free market" in the selection and training of scientific research cadres. He said: "In the past, the emphasis on unified distribution and obedience to the organization was absolutely necessary in the early days of the founding of the country, otherwise it would not be possible to ensure the needs of all aspects of national construction talents. But now, the situation has changed somewhat. If we only emphasize the unified distribution side without the rational use side, there are shortcomings." He believes that the past unified distribution method is like forced marriage, with no freedom of divorce. The "unification" is too rigid and should be changed in the future. A "free market" should be introduced as a supplement to the socialist unified market allocation, that is, young people should be allowed a certain degree of freedom of choice under the state-planned unified distribution.
    In his speech, the historian Lu Zhenyu focused on analyzing the objective reasons for the various problems existing in the work of the Academy of Sciences. He suggested that the Academy's Council gradually assume and conduct academic leadership, so as to distinguish it from the Academy's administrative meeting, so that the relationship between administrative leadership and academic leadership, the relationship between the Academy and the departments, and the relationship between administrative work and scientific research work can be gradually clarified and put into a regular track. He also proposed that we should specifically grasp the historical situation of the development of social sciences in our country since the May Fourth Movement, the entire academic life and creative achievements of each scientist, so as to be well-informed about scientific awards, scientific administration, and personnel arrangements for research work, and help resolve contradictions among senior intellectuals.
    The mechanician Qian Weichang requested that attention be paid to the research time of scientists and solve the problem of assistants for academicians. He said, can the State Council issue a circular throughout the country, allowing scientists who can lead scientific research work to take long-term leave in administrative work and social activities so that they can devote themselves to scientific research and cadre training. I propose that the director and deputy director of the department lead us to resolutely and quickly enter the laboratory, carry out the work that a scientist should carry out, and get rid of the administrative burden of the department's red tape as soon as possible. He also asked to solve the problem of purchasing books and instruments.
    The chemical engineer Hou Debang made a written statement on the scientific research plan. He suggested that the scientific research plan in the chemical industry should consider the following issues: After the upsurge of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, agricultural production requires the supply of more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other chemical fertilizers, among which the resource problem of potassium has not been well resolved; in the march towards science, books, instruments and chemical reagents are indispensable, among which the supply of chemical reagents is the most lacking in foundation; heavy organic synthesis includes a wide range and is also the weakest link in our country; recently, the lubricating oil used in high-temperature steam is in short supply.
    At yesterday's meeting, speeches were also made by mathematician Chen Jianguo, linguist Lu Shuxiang, organic chemist Zhu Ziqing, electronics expert Meng Zhaoying, petroleum chemist Hou Xianglin, optics expert Wang Daheng, physicist Shi Shiyuan, and aeronautical expert Wang Junkui. Written statements were made by chemist Ji Yufeng, mechanical engineer Shi Zhiren, hydrobiologist Wang Jiaji, geographer Huang Bingwei, metallurgist Jin Shuliang, physician Hu Tiaofu, electronics expert Chen Fangyun, hydraulic engineer Wang Huzhen, Renmin University teacher Wang Fangming, physicist Wang Zhuxi, botanist Qian Shuchong, and hydraulic engineer Zhang Guangdou. Physician Wu Yingkai and others made a joint written statement.

    科学院学部委员会全体会议继续大会发言
    张钰哲建议国务院适当下放一些事权
    千家驹建议在干部培养上搞点“自由市场”
    本报讯　中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议，28日继续大会发言。
    化学家汪猷的发言题目是“为留学生争鸣不平”，他以三个留学生的遭遇为例说，留学生庄亚辉由中国科学院有机化学研究所于1955年派到苏联学习高压有机合成，他在莫斯科闲等了一年多后，才由我国驻苏联大使馆留学生管理处分配到莫斯科大学作研究生。主管部门负责人曾三次说服该青年改变专业，最后说服他学放射化学。试问，放射化学与高压有机合成相隔几远？最后他呼吁：我愿有关党与非党的领导同志们，你们切莫忘记了千万客居异乡的莘莘学子，要爱护我们未来珍贵的科学进军中的栋材，快为他们以及将来的青年留学生设法解决由于以往主观主义、官僚主义而造成的烦恼和困难，更防止新的类似问题的产生。
    数学家王湘浩谈了科学文教人员的统筹兼顾适当安排问题。他指出，由于评定职务和工薪的标准不尽合理，有人把各尽所能理解为“万般皆下品、唯有读书高”；而且把所谓唯有读书高理解为唯有论文高。于是“各尽所能”成为
  “各尽所能地拼命写论文”，“按劳取酬”成为“按论文取酬”。他建议今后评定职务以德才为标准，不论年资；工薪以才资为标准，不论品德。他说，理由很简单，担任一个职务必须基本上称职而且要作风正派、工作积极。这就是德才标准。为什么不问年资呢？年纪大、工龄长并不见得胜任。评定工薪则不然。工薪必须考虑年资，汗马功劳不能不问。王湘浩还谈到了什么人应该受尊敬和生活待遇方面的统筹安排问题。
    天文学家张钰哲建议国务院把事权下放。他说，在协调平衡研究机构和高教、产业各部门之间的工作计划，必须国务院出来掌握，至于科学院一些本身的问题大可以让科学院的七位院长八位秘书长和几百名的学部委员去动脑筋去作决定。
    化学家卢嘉锡在发言中，要求科学院加强边疆地区的科学研究工作；逐步加强专门学会的学术活动，通过它来了解全国各地区的学术动态，把学术论坛更健康地组织起来。
    化学家袁翰青，批评科学院的工作有三大缺点：科学院没有能够很好地成为中共中央宣传部领导全国科学工作的参谋部；科学院院内的研究工作，没有能尽量地根据世界科学发展的趋向明确重点；科学院一直还没有使全国科学家感觉到它是全国科学家的科学院。
    经济学家沈志远在发言中首先提到了加强科学院和高等学校、产业部门三个系统研究力量合作的问题，他建议三个系统的科学工作者可以在自由自愿的基础上互兼研究或教学工作。同时对分散在各方面的安排不当的科学研究人士，由政府对他们进行一次全面的调查，让他们分别归队。
    经济学家千家驹建议在科学研究干部的选拔培养上搞点“自由市场”。他说：“在干部调派上，过去强调统一分配，服从组织，这在建国初期是完全必要的，否则就不能保证国家建设人才的各方面的需要。但到了现在，情况已有所改变，如果单单强调统一分配一面，而没有合理使用一面，那是有缺点的。”他认为过去统一分配的办法，好像是强迫婚姻，绝无离婚自由，“统”的太死了，今后应该加以改变，搞点“自由市场”，作为社会主义统一市场调配的补充，即在国家有计划的统一分配之下允许青年某种程度的自由选择。
    历史学家吕振羽在发言中着重分析了科学院工作中存在的种种问题的客观原因后，他建议科学院的院务委员会逐渐担负和进行学术领导，以之与院务行政会议区别开，以便行政领导和学术领导的关系、院部与学部的关系、行政工作与科学研究工作的关系等逐渐明确起来而步入常轨。他还提出，应具体掌握五四以来我国社会科学发展的历史情况，各个科学家的全部学术生活和创造成果，从而对科学评奖、科学行政和研究工作的人事安排等作到心中有数，措置得当，并帮助解决高级知识分子间的矛盾。
    力学家钱伟长要求重视科学家的研究时间，解决学部委员的助手问题。他说，可否由国务院通令全国，准许能领导科学研究工作的科学家在行政工作和社会活动方面长期请假，以便他们全力从事科学研究和干部培养工作。我提议由学部主任副主任领导我们坚决地迅速地走进实验室，进行一个科学家应该进行的工作，而把学部的繁文细节的行政包袱，趁早丢掉。他还要求解决图书仪器的购置问题。
    化学工程学家侯德榜就科学研究计划作书面发言。他建议科学研究计划在化学工业方面应该考虑到以下几个问题：在全国农业合作化高潮之后的农业生产要求供应更多的氮、磷、钾等化学肥料，其中钾的资源问题还没有很好地解决；在向科学进军中，图书、仪器和化学试剂三者缺一不可，其中化学试剂的供应最缺乏基础；重有机合成包括的范围很广，也是我国最薄弱的一环；近来高温蒸汽用的滑润油很缺。
    在昨天的会议上，发言的还有数学家陈建功，语言学家吕叔湘，有机化学家朱子清，电子学家孟昭英，石油化学家侯祥麟，光学家王大珩，物理学家施士元，航空学家王俊奎。书面发言的有化学家纪育沣、机械工程学家石志仁、水生生物学家王家楫、地理学家黄秉维、冶金学家靳树梁、医学家胡调甫、电子学家陈芳允、水利工程学家汪胡桢、中国人民大学教师王方名、物理学家王竹溪、植物学家钱树崇、水利工程学家张光斗。医学家吴英恺等九人作了联合书面发言。
