Afraid the World Isn't Chaotic Enough
The United States Ships Large Quantities of Military Supplies to the Middle East
Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: TASS, New York, May 20th: According to the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, in less than two months after the U.S. Congress passed the "Eisenhower Doctrine," American weapons and materials have been continuously shipped to the Middle East, a region of about five thousand miles long bordering the southern Soviet Union, from Libya to Afghanistan. Some Middle Eastern countries have been constantly receiving jet fighters, rifles, machine guns, mortars, and other infantry equipment, including tanks and infantry transport equipment.

The magazine pointed out that the United States is paying special attention to equipping the police forces of Middle Eastern countries in order to suppress so-called "riots." In addition, in order to achieve subversive propaganda purposes, the United States has also shipped some specially made radio stations to some Middle Eastern countries.

    惟恐天下不乱
    美国向中东大量运军火
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，在美国国会通过“艾森豪威尔主义”以后不到两个月，美国的武器和物资就源源不断地运往从利比亚到阿富汗这片长约五千英里的同苏联南部接壤的中东地区。中东一些国家不断收到喷气歼击机、步枪、机关枪、迫击炮和其他步兵装备，包括坦克和步兵转运装备。
    杂志指出，美国特别注意装备中东各国的警察部队，以便镇压所谓“骚乱”。此外，为了达到颠复宣传的目的，美国还向一些中东国家运去一些特制的无线电台。
