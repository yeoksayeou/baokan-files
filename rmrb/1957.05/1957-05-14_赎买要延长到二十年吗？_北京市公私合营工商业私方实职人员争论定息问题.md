Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Central Standing Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association jointly convened a symposium in Beijing today for some members of the association to discuss the issue of redemption policy.

This symposium was triggered by Li Kangnian, general manager of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Cuizhong Weaving Factory, who suggested to the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress that the fixed interest period be extended to twenty years. Those present included Ni Jiaxi, Zhang Huanyao, Lu Linxun, Wang Hongliang, Fan Qinong, Chi Xuewu, Liu Yuliang, Song Xueren, Meng Zhaosheng, Chang Mengqu, Yan Shaoqing, Zhang Guoqiang, Wu Buyuan, Gu Fuqing, Jiang Honglin, Lu Bingguang, Qu Yaoting, Yang Chengzhi, Han Zizheng, Lei Shaoyu, Wu Jincui, Cheng Zhongming, Zhang Lihong, and Zhang Shique, a total of twenty-four people. They were all private sector employees of joint state-private factories and shops in Beijing, and their speeches were very enthusiastic.

Three Views on the Meaning of Redemption Policy

At the meeting, everyone first analyzed the meaning of the redemption policy. Some said that redemption is the state's care for the bourgeoisie; some said that it should be interpreted as the legitimate interests or reasonable profits that the bourgeoisie should receive; some said that redemption should be regarded as a measure fee in the state's socialist construction. They believed that it was worthwhile for the state to spend money to hand over the bourgeois enterprises to the state in a complete manner.

Regarding Li Kangnian's proposal to redeem over twenty years, those present believed that his spirit of boldly putting forward his own opinions was very good. However, different views were put forward on the proposal itself at the meeting.

Some People Advocate That Since There Is Redemption, It Should Be Redeemed to the End

Some people believe that since the government implements the redemption policy, it should be redeemed to the end. Calculated at an annual fixed interest rate of five percent, it would take twenty years to redeem completely. Otherwise, calling the redemption of a few tens of percent also as redemption cannot make people feel at ease. If it is stipulated that the fixed interest rate is for twenty years, it does not mean that everyone will take it for twenty years. Based on ideological transformation, many people will automatically give up the fixed interest. Therefore, adopting this suggestion can better encourage the enthusiasm of private sector personnel, and it will also have a better impact internationally. Others advocate that if it is not possible to achieve full redemption, it is better to declare that the property of the bourgeoisie is "what exploiters should be expropriated." Then, no matter how much the fixed interest is, it is the government's care for the bourgeoisie, and everyone will not have any objections.

Many People Say That a Fixed Interest Rate of Twenty Years Has Three Major Disadvantages

However, many people disagreed with this view in their speeches. They believe that it is too narrow to simply regard the redemption policy as a five percent fixed interest rate. The government's policy of taking care of private sector employees and arranging jobs is also part of the redemption policy. At the same time, the capitalist's acceptance of transformation, that is, the policy of peaceful transformation, has both economic and political significance, and it is one-sided to consider it only from an economic point of view. Many people believe that there is no need for a fixed interest rate of twenty years at all. They said that when the state determines a fixed interest rate of seven years, and if there are difficulties at that time, it can be dragged on a little longer, and the living of the industrial and commercial circles can basically be managed. After seven years, the second five-year plan will be completed, social welfare undertakings may increase, and the vast majority of capitalists can support themselves, and their children can live independently. At that time, there is no need for a fixed interest rate at all. They also believe that proposing a fixed interest rate of twenty years now has several major disadvantages: First, it increases the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class. When the state determined the policy of a fixed interest rate of seven years, it also carried out a lot of persuasion and education work among the working masses. To propose a fixed interest rate of twenty years again will inevitably cause resentment among the working class, and the people of the whole country will also have a bad impression of the bourgeoisie, believing that the bourgeoisie is greedy and insatiable, which is also inappropriate from the standpoint of patriotism. Second, those small industrialists and businessmen with only a few thousand yuan of shares have very little fixed interest income and are eager to get rid of their "capitalist" label and become members of the working class. If it is dragged on for twenty years, they will absolutely not want to. Third, it is not conducive to the transformation of the bourgeoisie. Some people say: The characteristic of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is that they are willing to accept the leadership of the working class and are willing to take the road of socialism. Therefore, they must seriously transform themselves and strive to give up exploitation as soon as possible and become self-reliant laborers. Extending the fixed interest period in this way is not conducive to the transformation of the bourgeoisie.

There Are Also Two Opinions on When the Redemption Should Start

There were also different views at the meeting on when the redemption should start. Some people believe that it should start from 1949. In this way, plus the fixed interest rate of seven years, plus dragging on a little longer, it would roughly be about twenty years. This is also in line with the principle of redeeming to the end. However, more people believe that the redemption should start from 1956, because after the founding of the Central People's Government in 1949, it did not announce the redemption policy, but protected the private ownership of the means of production and encouraged the development of private industrial and commercial enterprises. The situation of private enterprises during this period was also very complicated, with some making money and some losing money, making it difficult to calculate. Therefore, it cannot be considered that the redemption policy was implemented at that time.

Suggestions to Designate Professional Banks to Issue Fixed Interest

The method of receiving fixed interest was also discussed at the meeting. Most people believe that the current procedures for issuing fixed interest are too cumbersome, and suggest that the government designate the Bank of Communications or other banks as the institutions for issuing fixed interest instead of the enterprise itself. They believe that there are two advantages to doing so: First, it can completely separate capitalists from the property relationship with the enterprise. Second, it can greatly simplify the cumbersome procedures for receiving dividends. According to reports at the meeting, at present, joint venture enterprises in various places issue fixed interest to capitalists who receive it from the enterprise with their stock certificates. However, shareholders in place A often hold stocks in place B, place C, and multiple regions, and overseas Chinese often hold multiple stocks in China. If local shareholders want to receive fixed interest from other places, they must entrust someone in other places to issue a formal power of attorney, report their place of residence, and send the original stock seal to receive it in other places, which is a very cumbersome procedure. If it is changed to local banks issuing it based on the stock certificate, it will be much more convenient.

What Is the Main Contradiction in the Industrial and Commercial Circles Today?

While discussing these issues of the redemption policy, some people at the meeting also believed that the main contradiction in the industrial and commercial circles today is not on the issue of fixed interest rates. It is not very meaningful to discuss this issue, and more discussions should be held on some issues that urgently need to be resolved, such as public-private relations, the contradictions between large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen, and so on.

Suggestions to Change the Name of Joint State-Private Operation to Local State-Owned

Many people at the meeting suggested that the government change the name of joint state-private operation to local state-owned. They put forward several reasons: (1) Since the joint state-private operation, capitalists have no relationship with the means of production of the enterprise, so the "private" no longer exists. It is not true to call it a joint state-private operation. If it is said that it is called a joint state-private operation because there are capitalists working in the enterprise, then many agencies and state-owned enterprises that have absorbed capitalists to work have not been called joint state-private enterprises. (2) Changing to a state-owned enterprise can ease labor-capital contradictions. (3) Abolishing the joint venture title does not hinder the transformation of capitalists. (4) Capitalists can completely become public servants, be happy, work more conveniently, and better play their enthusiasm. Now the private side is both a capitalist and a state worker, and the status is very difficult. (5) There are many internal contradictions in the current joint venture enterprises, and the relationship is complicated, especially the contradictions between public and private. If it is changed to state-owned, the contradictions can be basically resolved.

At the meeting, everyone expressed many opinions on issues such as when capitalists can get rid of their capitalist label, labor insurance and welfare benefits, calculation of seniority, and living problems.

    赎买要延长到二十年吗？
    北京市公私合营工商业私方实职人员争论定息问题
    新华社13日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会和北京市委员会今天联合召集北京市部分民建会员座谈赎买政策问题。
    这个座谈会是由上海市公私合营萃众织造厂总经理李康年向上海市人民代表大会建议定息时间延至二十年这一问题引起的。到会的有倪家玺、张焕尧、陆麟勋、王宏亮、樊勤农、迟学五、刘玉梁、宋学仁、孟昭生、常梦渠、阎少青、张国强、武步元、顾扶青、姜宏林、卢炳光、曲耀庭、杨承志、韩子铮、雷绍瑜、吴金萃、程仲鸣、张立宏、张?石二十四人。他们都是北京市公私合营工厂和商店的私方实职人员，发言极为踊跃。
    对赎买政策的含义有三种看法
    会上大家首先分析了赎买政策的含义，有的说赎买是国家对资产阶级的照顾；有的说应把它作为资产阶级应得的合法利益或合理利润来解释；有的说应把赎买看作为国家社会主义建设中的一笔措施费，他们认为国家花了钱使资产阶级的企业很完整交给国家，这是值得的。
    对于李康年提出赎买二十年的建议，到会的人都认为他大胆地提出自己意见的精神是很好的。但是对这个建议本身，会上提出了不同的看法。
  有的人主张既然赎买就该赎买到底
    有的人认为既然政府实行赎买政策，就应该赎买到底，按每年定息五厘计算，那就要二十年才能赎完。否则，把赎买百分之几十也叫做赎买，不能使人心平气和。如果规定定息二十年，也并不是所有的人都要拿二十年，在思想改造的基础上，许多人会自动放弃定息。因此采纳这个建议可以更好地鼓励私方人员的积极性，在国际上也会有更好的影响。还有人主张假使不能实现全部赎买，倒不如宣布资产阶级的财产是“剥夺者应被剥夺”，那么定息不论多少都是政府对资产阶级的照顾，这样大家也不会有意见。
  很多人说定息二十年有三大不利
    但是很多人发言中不同意这种看法。他们认为把赎买政策单纯看做五厘定息就太狭窄了，政府对私方实职人员采取包下来的政策，安排了工作，这也是赎买政策的一部分。同时资本家的接受改造即和平改造政策有经济意义也有政治意义，只从经济上来考虑是片面的。许多人认为根本不需要定息二十年。他们说在国家确定定息七年，到时有困难再拖个尾巴，工商界的生活基本上是可以过得去了。七年后，第二个五年计划完成，社会福利事业可能增多，绝大多数资本家可以自食其力，子女又能独立生活，到那时根本不需要定息。他们还认为现在提出定息二十年有几大不利：一，增加了资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾。在国家确定定息七年的政策时，还对工人群众进行了许多说服教育工作，再要提出定息二十年必然引起工人阶级的反感，而且全国人民对资产阶级也会产生不良的印象，认为资产阶级贪多无厌，从爱国主义的立场上看也是不妥当的。二，那些只有几千元股金的小工商业者，定息收入很少，迫切希望摘掉帽子，成为工人阶级的一分子，如果一直拖到二十年，他们是绝对不会愿意的。三，对资产阶级的改造不利。有人说：中国民族资产阶级的特点是愿意接受工人阶级领导，愿走社会主义的道路，因此必须认真改造自己争取早日放弃剥削，成为自食其力的劳动者，这样延长定息年限，对资产阶级的改造是不利的。
  赎买从那一年算起也有两种意见
    会上对于赎买应从那一年算起也有不同的看法，有人认为应从1949年算起。这样，加上定息七年，再拖个尾巴，加起来大体上也就是二十年左右。这也符合了赎买到底的原则 。但是更多的人认为赎买应从1956年算起，因为1949年中央人民政府成立后并没有宣布赎买政策，而是保护生产资料私有制，鼓励私营工商业的发展，有些工商业者还投资来扩大生产。这段时期私营企业的情况也很复杂，有赚钱的也有赔钱的，很难计算。所以那时不能认为是实行了赎买政策。
    建议指定专业银行发放定息
    对领取定息的方法，会上也作了讨论。大多数人认为现在定息发放的手续过于麻烦，建议不由本企业，而由政府指定交通银行或其他银行为发放定息的机构。他们认为这样做的好处有二：一、可使资本家完全脱离与企业的财产关系。二、可大大简化领取股息时的麻烦手续。据会上反映，目前各地合营企业发放定息都是资本家凭股票向企业领取。但在甲地股东，往往执有乙地、丙地以及多处地区股票，海外华侨往往执有国内多种股票。如果本地股东，要领取异地定息，必须在异地托人具正式委证书，报明居住户籍，寄带原股票印章，才能在异地领取，手续非常麻烦。如果改为当地银行凭股票发放，就方便多了。
  当前工商界的主要矛盾是什么？
    在讨论赎买政策的这些问题时，会上也有人认为当前工商界主要矛盾不是在定息问题上，讨论这个问题意义不大，应该更多地讨论一些当前迫切需要解决的问题，如公私关系，大、中、小工商业者的矛盾等等。
  建议改公私合营牌子为地方国营
    会上不少人建议政府把公私合营牌子改为地方国营。他们提出了几条理由：（1）自公私合营以后，资本家与企业的生产资料已没有关系，所以“私”已不存在，称为公私合营，是名不符实。如果说，因有资本家在企业工作才称为公私合营，那么，不少机关、国营企业吸收了资本家工作，也并没有称为公私合营企业。（2）改为国营企业后，可缓和劳资矛盾。（3）取消合营牌子，并不妨碍资本家的改造。（4）资本家可以完全成为公家人，情绪愉快，工作起来更方便，也可以更好地发挥积极性。现在私方一面是资本家，一面又是国家工作人员，地位很困难。（5）目前合营企业内部矛盾很多，关系复杂，特别是公私矛盾，如改为国营，矛盾可基本得到解决。
    会上大家对资本家什么时候摘帽子、劳保福利待遇、工龄计算、生活问题等问题都发表了很多意见。
