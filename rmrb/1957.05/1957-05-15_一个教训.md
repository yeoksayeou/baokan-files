A Lesson
      By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Western countries are now finally forced to admit that all their attempts to infringe upon Egypt’s sovereignty over the Suez Canal have failed, and thus they cannot but use the canal according to Egypt’s terms. This is a lesson worth pondering for those imperialists who are still planning to infringe upon the interests of the people of the Middle East.

    On May 13, the British government announced that it would no longer advise British shipowners not to use the Suez Canal. At the same time, Britain has been negotiating with Egypt through intermediate channels on the issue of paying tolls in pounds. Informal negotiations between Britain and Egypt on restoring business relations are also underway. Prior to this, the communiqué issued on May 9 by the Council of the so-called "Suez Canal Users Association" in fact admitted that it was no longer possible to continue boycotting the canal. In this way, Western countries have publicly acknowledged that their pressure on Egypt from all sides has been bankrupt, and the Egyptian people's firm efforts to safeguard their sovereignty have been victorious.

    The British government’s decision can be said to be wise and in its own interest. The "Times" of London called using the canal according to Egypt's terms a "bitter pill" and said, "Bitter pills have to be swallowed." It should be pointed out that this "bitter pill" was made by Britain itself. Because Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal is indisputable. If Britain had not been so foolish as to try to achieve its goals with "gunboat diplomacy" in modern times, then accepting Egypt's terms would not have become a "bitter pill" at all. Many countries that have been using the canal since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company have never considered that they were taking a "bitter pill."

    There is an old Chinese saying, "Good medicine tastes bitter but benefits the disease." Britain and some Western countries are suffering from the imperialist disease of aggression, and taking this "bitter pill" is good for them. However, judging from many signs, it is still doubtful whether this "bitter pill" can cure their disease. The French government still refuses to allow French ships to use the Suez Canal. And Britain and other members of the so-called "Users Association," while unable to ignore reality, still express their unwillingness to accept Egypt's terms. This shows that their idea of infringing on Egypt's sovereignty has not died.

    In particular, the United States, the imperialist country that regards the Middle East as its newly developed colony, is undisguisedly hostile to the Egyptian government and people. It wants other Western countries to be patient for the time being and wait for the opportunity. An "authoritative source" in Paris, in the United States, openly stated on May 6 that "efforts should continue to be made to achieve more satisfactory conditions for passage through the Suez Canal, especially the participation of canal users in the management of the canal." He also bluntly stated that the purpose of this effort is to ensure that "one day Egypt will have a different government with different ideals." In this regard, the conspiracy of Western countries to assassinate President Nasser, revealed by the "Washington Post and Times Herald" on May 1, is very noteworthy. In addition, the United Press reported from Washington on May 2 that some U.S. officials have told other canal users that the U.S. will create economic difficulties for Egypt to force Egypt to seek loans, and then take this opportunity to ask Egypt to modify its terms.

    The basic purpose of the United States' current aggression in the Middle East is to isolate Egypt and Syria, and to shake and undermine these two countries from the outside and inside, so that they change their independent policies. The reason why the United States wants to do this is to gain absolute control over the Middle East, make this region a U.S. colony, and use it as a springboard for expansion into Africa. However, the entire development process of the Suez Canal issue has proven that any conspiracy to infringe on the interests of the people of the Middle East is bound to fail. Those Western countries that have suffered losses because of following the United States' idea of the "international control" of the Suez Canal plan can now calmly think about what benefits there are in pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States.

    一个教训
      本报评论员
    西方国家现在终于不得不承认，它们企图侵犯埃及对苏伊士运河的主权的一切尝试都已经失败，因而不能不按照埃及的条件使用运河。这是值得那些还在打算侵犯中东各国人民的利益的帝国主义者们深思的一个教训。
    英国政府在5月13日宣布，它不再劝告英国船主不使用苏伊士运河。同时，英国已经通过中间途径，同埃及商谈用英镑缴付通行费的问题。英埃之间关于恢复商务关系的非正式谈判也正在进行。在此以前，所谓“苏伊士运河使用国协会”理事会在5月9日发表的公报，事实上承认再继续抵制运河已经不可能了。这样，西方国家就等于公开承认，它们对埃及从各方面施加的压力已经宣告破产，而埃及人民维护自己的主权的坚定努力已经取得了胜利。
    英国政府作出这样的决定，应该说是明智的，是符合于它本身的利益的。英国的“泰晤士报”把按照埃及的条件使用运河称之为一服“苦药”，并且说，“苦药是要吞下去的”。应当指出，这服 “苦药”是英国自己制造出来的。因为，埃及对苏伊士运河的主权是不容置辩的。如果英国不曾愚蠢到想在现代用“炮舰政策”来达到自己目的的话，那末接受埃及的条件完全不可能成为一服“苦药”。从埃及把苏伊士运河公司国有化以来一直在使用运河的许多国家，就从来不曾认为它们是在吃“苦药”。
    中国有句老话说，“良药苦口利于病”。英国和某些西方国家害的是帝国主义的侵略病，吃吃这种“苦药”对它们是有好处的。不过，从许多迹象看来，这服“苦药”是不是能够把它们的病医好，还是个疑问。法国政府仍然拒绝让法国船只使用苏伊士运河。而英国和所谓“使用国协会”的其他会员国，在不能不正视现实的时候，还表示不愿接受埃及的条件。这表明它们侵犯埃及主权的念头还没有死。
    特别是美国，这个把中东当作它新开拓的殖民地的帝国主义国家，正在毫不掩饰它对埃及政府和人民的仇视。它要其他西方国家在目前暂时忍耐，等待时机。美国在巴黎的一个“权威人士”，在5月6日公开说，“应该继续努力，争取实现较为令人满意的通过苏伊士运河的条件，特别是运河使用者参加运河的管理。”他并且露骨地说，这种努力的目的，就是使得“有一天埃及会有一个不同的政府，这个政府将具有不同的理想”。关于这方面，“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在5月1日透露的西方国家打算谋杀纳赛尔总统的阴谋，是很值得注意的。此外，合众社在5月2日从华盛顿报道说，一些美国官员已经告诉其它运河使用国说，美国将用给埃及制造经济困难的办法来使埃及寻求贷款，然后乘此机会来要求埃及修改它的条件。
    美国现在在中东的侵略活动，基本目的之一就是要孤立埃及和叙利亚，从外部和内部来动摇和破坏这两个国家，使它们改变它们所坚持的独立政策。美国之所以要这样做，是为了要取得对中东地区的绝对控制，使这个地区成为美国的殖民地，并且把它作为对非洲进行扩张的跳板。但是，苏伊士运河问题的整个发展过程已经证明，任何侵犯中东人民利益的阴谋，都是必然要失败的。那些由于追随美国想出来的“国际管制”苏伊士运河计划而受到了损失的西方国家，现在可以冷静地想一想：替美国火中取栗究竟会有什么好处。
