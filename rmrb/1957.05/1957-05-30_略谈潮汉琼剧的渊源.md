"Red beans grow in the South, how many branches will sprout in the spring?" This is the Tang poem quoted by Premier Zhou Enlai last year when the Cantonese Opera came to Beijing to perform and won popular acclaim, used to praise Cantonese Opera. In fact, Cantonese Opera includes not only Guangzhou Opera, but also several other famous types, such as Chaozhou Opera, Gaozhou Opera, Huizhou Opera, Qiong Opera, Yangjiang Opera, and the Waijiang troupes of Chaozhou, each with its own merits. Therefore, the red bean tree is lush and verdant, a treasure of the South, but unfortunately it is not widely popular, often limited to one corner, so that few people know about it, and it is often despised as local folk opera, without being studied. This is not only a deficiency in the opera world, but also shows that feudal remnants hinder all progress, and opera is no exception.

This time, the Cantonese Opera performance in Beijing included Chaozhou Opera, Qiong Opera, and Han Opera. Except for Chaozhou Opera, which had been to Shanghai (in fact, it has been performed many times in overseas Chinese settlements, and is especially popular wherever Chaozhou natives gather), the Qiong Opera and Han Opera only came to Guangzhou this time, but never to Beijing. This first visit is exploratory for them, and the audience also has some curiosity and research interest. After seeing the performance, not only the audience was satisfied, but also the troupes themselves had a feeling of unexpectedness. This is naturally inseparable from the advocacy and support of the central and local cultural authorities, as well as the efforts of the troupe members to learn and improve. If we look deeper, there are things worth analyzing and verifying, that is, tracing the origin of these opera types and their evolution.

The nationalities of Fujian and Guangdong provinces are inherently complex, including local indigenous people and those who migrated south from the Central Plains. Their history is not easy to make clear, but it can be said that the original nationalities had culture. Since the culture of Chu during the Warring States period scattered into the Baiyue culture and spread into various parts of Fujian and Guangdong, from the Five Barbarians and Sixteen Kingdoms and the late Tang and late Song dynasties, people from the Central Plains migrated south one after another, bringing many cultures, which combined with the local indigenous culture to form something new, presenting many characteristics. At the same time, Fujian and Guangdong, due to their proximity to the sea, constantly had international communication, so foreign cultures also intermingled from time to time. These traces can be found at any time and in any matter, and the art of drama is naturally no exception. Take the Hakka Han Opera, for example. It and the Han Opera popular in Hubei were originally one family, but when it arrived in Guangdong, it added local flesh and blood and skin (referring to dialogues, costumes, and musical instruments, etc.), and many changes occurred, but the source is still connected by a single thread. The same is true for Chaozhou Opera. Since Gaoqiang became popular in Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, it also spread to southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong, gradually combining with the local indigenous languages and music, and singing folk tales, thus becoming a unique opera in this region. Southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong are geographically connected, and the form and quality of the opera are also very similar, which is also very natural. As for Qiong Opera, it cannot be separated from this rule. Although Qiongzhou is far from Chaozhou, it did not accept Central Plains culture from Cao Lianlei, but instead accepted some Central Plains culture from Chaozhou, probably because maritime transportation was easier. Although Qiongzhou is isolated overseas, since the Tang and Song dynasties, it has gradually become a medium for international cultural exchange. During the Ming Dynasty, Qiu Qiongshan, Jun Hai, Gang Feng, and Rui were all famous scholars, and Qiu Qiongshan even compiled operas. The foundation of culture at that time was quite deep, and it is not surprising that it could accept Central Plains culture. There are many other unique operas in Qiongzhou, and if they are actively explored, they will surely become more rich and colorful. This performance, although not comprehensive, shows a glimpse of the meticulous workmanship and harmonious and stable singing. What is particularly noteworthy is that in terms of music, it can utilize the "houguan" and "gaoxian." The "houguan" is the "bili" introduced from abroad during the Tang Dynasty. At that time, it led various wind instruments for nearly a thousand years. Since the rise of Ping Opera, the erhu began to replace its position, but Gaoqiang, Yiyangqiang, etc., still used it to lead the ensemble, so it is still used in places in the South where the legacy of Gaoqiang remains. Its original name should be "touguan." The Cantonese pronunciation of "tou" and "hou" is similar, so it was mistakenly called "houguan." Several years ago, the Zhihua Temple in Beijing discovered this object, and everyone was surprised to see it as a new discovery, examined as the legacy of Tang and Song Dynasty music, but in fact it is still commonly used in the South. From this, it can be seen that the music of Qiong Opera and general Cantonese Opera, including the musical instruments and even the tunes used, are not lacking in historical relics and foreign cultures that can be examined.

This performance in Beijing by the Guangdong Provincial Chaozhou Opera, Han Opera, and Qiong Opera Troupes is a good starting point for developing the art of various opera types in Guangdong. The red beans of the South, encountering the caress of the spring breeze, will surely bear good fruit in the future.

    略谈潮汉琼剧的渊源
    叶恭绰
    “红豆生南国，春来发几枝”。这是去年粤剧来京表演博得大众欢迎时，周恩来总理所引的唐诗，来称誉粤剧的。其实粤剧不止广州剧，著名的尚有多种，如潮州班、高州班、惠州班、琼州班、阳江班和潮州的外江班等，均各有优点。故红豆枝繁叶茂，蔚为南国之珍，所惜流行不广，往往仅局限于一隅，以至知之者稀，且往往鄙为土风村戏，不加研究。这不但是戏剧界的一种缺失，亦可见封建余毒，阻碍一切进步，戏剧亦不能例外。
    这一次粤剧来京表演，其中包括潮剧、琼剧和汉剧，除潮剧曾到过上海（其实在国外华侨所在地，曾演出多次，凡潮籍华侨聚居之地，尤受欢迎）外，其琼剧和汉剧，则这次才到广州，但从未到过北京。这次初来，在他们是观摩性质，在观众也就有些好奇和研究意味，等到看到表演后，不但观众认为满意，即各剧团亦有出乎意外之感。这自然同中央和地方的文化当局的提倡扶植，及各团员的努力学习改进，是分不开的。如果深一层看，这其中是有值得分析考证的地方，那就是追溯这些剧种的由来，和其演进的经过。
    福建、广东两省的民族，本较复杂，有当地固有的，有中原南迁的，其历史不易作明确的考订，但可说原有的民族，是有文化的。自战国时楚的文化，散为百越文化，分入闽粤各地，从之五胡十六国和唐末、宋末，中原人相率南迁，带来了许多文化，同当地固有文化结合，形成为一种新的东西，呈现了许多特色。同时闽粤因濒海之故，不断和国际交通，于是外来的文化，也时相媾化。这种痕迹，随时随事，都可找到，戏剧艺术自然也不会例外。拿客家的汉剧来说罢，他和湖北流行的汉剧，本是一家，但到了广东，加上了当地的血肉和皮肤（指道白服装和乐器等等），便发生了不少的变化，但来源仍是一线相连的。潮州戏亦然，自高腔流行湘、川、赣、桂各地，因而也散入闽南粤东，逐渐结合地方固有的语言和音乐，演唱民间故事，因此就成了这地区特有的戏曲。闽南粤东，地理相连，戏剧的形质，也很相近，这也是很自然的。至于琼剧也不能离开这个规律，琼州和潮州相距虽远，所以不由曹廉雷一带来接受中原文化，而反由潮州来接受一些中原文化，大概是由于海道交通较为容易之故，琼州虽孤悬海外，但自唐宋以来，逐渐为国际文化交流的媒介。明代丘琼山浚海刚峰瑞，皆为有名学者，丘琼山且亦曾编戏曲，当时文化的基础，即颇深厚，能接受中原文化，毫不足奇。其他琼州特有的戏剧，固尚不少，如积极地加以发掘，必能更加丰富多彩。这一次的演出，虽不是全面，但做工的细致，和唱腔的谐稳，已见一斑。尤其值得注意的，是音乐一方面，能利用“喉管”和“高弦”，喉管即是唐代自国外传入的“?篥”，当时领导各种管器，将近千年，自皮黄盛行，始以胡琴代其位，但高腔弋阳腔等，仍以之领众乐，故此南方尚存高腔遗韵的地方，依然使用，其原名当是头管，粤音头喉二字音近，故讹为喉管，前数年北京智化寺发见此物，众詑为创见，考为唐宋大乐之遗，其实南方仍甚习用。即此可见琼剧和一般粤剧的音乐，其中所用乐器乃至音调，不乏可以考见历代文物和外来文化的。
    这次广东省潮、汉、琼剧团在京的演出，是发展广东各剧种艺术的很好的起点。南国的红豆，遇到春风披拂，将来定会结出好果的。
