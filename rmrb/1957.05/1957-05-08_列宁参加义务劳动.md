Lenin Participates in Voluntary Labor

    The picture above is a painting by the Soviet artist Lebedev, depicting the great Lenin participating in the voluntary Saturday labor in Moscow's Kremlin Square on the "May Day" International Labor Day in 1920.

    The "May Day" in Moscow in 1920 was different from usual: from early morning, the streets and lanes were filled with teams of workers and staff. People put on work clothes and short jackets, carrying shovels and pickaxes, singing revolutionary songs, and marching forward. Everyone was radiant, cheers rose and fell, and everything indicated people's soaring enthusiasm. The Communist Youth League's team also marched with light steps, as mighty as soldiers.

    On this day, one sentence could be heard everywhere. People said this sentence, both as a greeting and as a call to action. That sentence was: Voluntary Saturday.

    Lenin was very fond of this spring, happy proletarian holiday - "May Day". He always actively participated in this festival. In this year, when the masses hoped to commemorate their festival with collective creative labor, he was particularly happy. He called on everyone to participate in voluntary Saturday labor.

    On the Kremlin Square, the ranks of Red Army soldiers were lined up. They were also participating in voluntary Saturday labor, because there was a lot of work to be done everywhere. The commander allocated manpower and tools according to the work areas. At nearly nine o'clock, Lenin walked out of his living room. His expression was unusually excited. He walked towards the Red Army's lined-up barracks. As he approached the commander, he reported to the commander in accordance with military etiquette:

    "Comrade Commander, please allow me to join your ranks and participate in the voluntary Saturday labor together."

    The commander couldn't think of what to say in reply for a moment. Soon, he calmed down and said:

    "Please come and participate, Comrade Lenin."

    Lenin walked to the right and stood in the middle of the line. Cheers immediately rang out in the ranks: "Comrade Lenin is participating in voluntary Saturday labor with us!"

    The command sounded. The team was suddenly silent and, accompanied by the band, marched to the work site. Lenin, wearing a gray cap and a short jacket, walked in that ordinary yet great Red Army line that he understood and cherished.

    Everyone started working together. They carried planks, logs, and beams, and stacked them neatly. The commander and the Red Army soldiers advised Lenin not to exert himself too much and asked him to do some lighter work. Because everyone knew that he had not yet recovered his health after being injured. But as a result, Lenin didn't even want to listen. On the contrary, he always went to places where the work was particularly heavy, and unhesitatingly carried heavy things, while humming revolutionary songs. Seeing everyone immersed in the enthusiasm of labor, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart.

    When the commander announced a break, Lenin was surrounded by the soldiers. He told jokes, asked questions, chatted with everyone; everyone felt very happy to be with him and hoped to work better. When everyone started working again, everyone worked twice as hard: Lenin's presence encouraged everyone and gave everyone new strength.

    列宁参加义务劳动
    上面这张图片是苏联画家列别捷夫绘画的一幅，画的是伟大的列宁在1920年“五一”国际劳动节参加莫斯科克里姆林宫广场义务星期六劳动的情景。
    1920年莫斯科的“五一”节跟往常不一样：从清晨起，街头巷尾，便尽是工人和职员的队伍。人们穿上了工作服和短便衣，拿着铁锹和十字镐锄，唱着革命歌曲，向前行进。人人容光焕发，欢呼声此伏彼起，一切都表示着人们的昂扬热情。共青团的队伍也踏着轻捷的步伐，像军人那样威武地行进着。
    这天早晨，到处都可以听到一句话。人们说着这句话，又像问候，又像号召。这句话就是：义务星期六。
    列宁非常喜欢这个春天的、愉快的无产阶级欢乐的节日——“五一”节。他一向是积极参加这个节日的。在这一年，当群众希望用集体的创造性劳动来纪念自己节日的时候，他更是特别高兴。他号召大家都来参加义务星期六劳动。
    在克里姆林宫广场上，排列着红军战士的队伍。他们也是参加义务星期六劳动的，因为到处都有许多工作。指挥员按工作地段分配了人力，配备了工具。将近九点钟，列宁从他的住室中走出来。他的神情异常激动。他向着红军列队的营房走去。走近指挥员的时候，他按照部队礼节，向指挥员报告：
    “指挥员同志，请允许我也加入你们的队伍，一起参加义务星期六劳动吧。”
    指挥员一时想不出用什么话来回答才好。不久，他镇静下来了，说道：
    “请来参加吧，列宁同志。”
    列宁就向右侧走去，站在行列的中间。队伍中马上响起了欢呼声：“列宁同我们在一起参加义务星期六劳动啦！”
    口令声响了。队伍顿时一片肃静，在乐队的伴奏下向工作地点进发。列宁戴着灰色的便帽，穿着短上衣，走在那平凡而又伟大的，他所了解和爱护的红军的列队里。
    大家一齐地开始工作了。他们搬运木板、圆木、横梁，并把它们整齐地堆放起来。指挥员和红军战士都劝列宁不要过分用力，请他干些比较轻松的活。因为大家知道，他受伤以后还没有恢复健康。可是结果呢，列宁连听也不想听。相反地，他总是到工作特别繁重的地方去，毫不犹豫地背起沉重的东西，一面还哼着革命歌曲。看到大家都沉浸在劳动的热情中，他从心底里感到愉快。
    当指挥员宣布休息的时候，列宁被战士们密密层层地围起来了。他和大家讲着笑话，问这问那的，跟大家聊天；大家都觉得同他在一起精神十分愉快，都希望更好地工作。当大家再度开始干活的时候，每个人都加倍起劲地劳动着：列宁的在场，鼓舞了大家，给大家增添了新的力量。
