Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 23rd: President Coty of France began on the 22nd to tackle the arduous task of finding a new Prime Minister. Parisian newspapers emphasized that the situation facing France does not allow the government crisis to continue, but they are also worried that this crisis will not be easily resolved.

    "L'Aurore" pointed out that the primary problems France must solve are Algeria, foreign exchange, and the issue of "European unification." These problems will not be effectively resolved amidst political turmoil. The newspaper called for the speedy formation of a "national unity" government, excluding the Communist Party, to end the government crisis.

    "Combat" stated that this crisis will not be easily resolved. Coty consulted with parliamentary and party leaders on the 22nd, warning them to resolve their differences within ten days and propose a new Prime Minister to succeed Mollet.

    Well-informed sources say that Coty will not follow the traditional procedure of first requesting the major parties in parliament that brought down the government to organize a new government. This is because Antoine Pinay, the leader of the conservatives who played a role in the vote, stated after meeting with Coty on the 21st that it would be a "waste of time" to have him attempt to form a government.

    According to well-informed sources in the National Assembly on the 22nd, Coty is considering René Pleven as the first candidate for Prime Minister. Pleven's Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, with its twenty members of parliament, has long been referred to as the "pivot" between the left and right wings. However, it is said that Pleven has indicated he will only step forward after all other Prime Ministerial nominees have been rejected by the National Assembly.

    Among the names most frequently mentioned as candidates for Prime Minister are former Prime Minister René Pleven, Justice Minister of the Mollet government François Mitterrand, and former Minister and Popular Republican Party member Pierre Pflimlin. The first two belong to the same party, and their political stances are close to the Radical Socialist Party. Additionally, reports suggest that the decisive issue at present is that without the support of the hundred Socialist Party members of the National Assembly, no new Prime Minister can form a government.

    The French Communist Party parliamentary group issued a statement on the evening of the 22nd, calling for the re-establishment of a "Popular Front" of communists and socialists. The "L'Humanité" newspaper published a commentary on the 22nd, stating, "Workers, democrats, must work together to establish a government capable of implementing the new policies approved by universal suffrage and awaited by this country."

    法国政府危机延续
    法共议会党团呼吁重建人民阵线
    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国总统戈蒂从22日开始着手进行他的吃力的物色新总理的工作。巴黎的报纸强调指出，法国面临的局势不允许政府危机延续下去，但是它们又担心这次危机将不易解决。
      “震旦报”指出，法国当前必须解决的首要问题是阿尔及利亚、外汇和“欧洲统一”问题。而这些问题在政治混乱中是不会得到有效的解决的。这家报纸要求赶快结成把共产党排斥在外的“全国团结”，来结束政府危机。
      “战斗报”说，这次危机将不易解决。戈蒂曾经在22日先后同议会和政党领袖们进行了磋商，并且向他们提出警告，限他们在十天之内解决他们之间的纷歧并提出一个新总理来作摩勒的继任人。
    消息灵通人士说，戈蒂将不遵循传统程序首先要求议会中使得政府垮台的主要党派出来组织新政府。因为，在这次投票中起了作用的保守分子的领袖安托万·比内在21日同戈蒂会谈以后表示，要他试组政府将是“白费时间”。
    另据国民议会消息灵通人士22日透露，戈蒂正考虑把普利文作为总理提名人的第一个人选，因为普利文的有二十个议员的民主社会抵抗联盟长期以来被人称为左右两翼之间的“枢纽”。但是，据说普利文曾经表示，他要到所有其他的总理提名人都被国民议会否决之后才出面。
    目前最常提到的总理候选人的姓名中，有前总理雷纳·普利文、摩勒政府的司法部长弗朗索瓦·密特朗和前部长、人民共和党人比埃尔·弗林姆兰。前面两个人属于同一个党，他们的政治态度接近激进社会党。另外又有消息说，当前具有决定性的问题是如果没有国民议会中一百名社会党议员的支持，任何新总理都组不成政府。
    法国共产党议会党团22日晚间发表声明，呼吁重新建立共产党人和社会党人的“人民阵线”。22日的“人道报”发表评论说，“工人们，民主人士们，必须共同努力来建立一个能够执行普选所批准和这个国家所等待着的新政策的政府。”
