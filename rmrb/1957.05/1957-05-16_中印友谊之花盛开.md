The Blossoming of Sino-Indian Friendship
Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association

There's no need to delve into the facts recorded in ancient history books with yellowing pages, nor is it necessary to ask historians for introductions. Just by looking back at the exchanges between China and India since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and listening to the increasingly loud slogan "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai," people can deeply feel that the flower of Sino-Indian friendship has blossomed in the hearts of a billion people. This flower not only has a glorious past but also a more splendid future.

The Himalayas, towering over 20,000 feet between China and India, did not prevent our ancestors from developing friendly relations between the two countries. Today, no force in the world can stop our friendship. Since time immemorial, our two countries have engaged in friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges. In the past century, the people of both countries have also been subjected to colonialist aggression, and have been engaged in the struggle for national independence. This shared experience makes us more sympathetic and caring for each other. After our two countries successively won independence, the joint efforts made by the two governments and peoples to achieve complete independence and economic and cultural prosperity in their own countries, and to safeguard world peace, have further deepened mutual understanding and friendship, especially the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence determined by the two Prime Ministers. This has enabled this traditional friendly relationship to develop and consolidate on a new foundation. Our cultural exchanges and economic and trade relations have been greatly strengthened, and our mutual visits have become more frequent. What makes us most happy and encouraged is that the Five Principles advocated by the Prime Ministers of the two countries have not only received wide support from the Bandung Conference and the people of Asia and Africa, but also have been supported by more and more other countries and peoples. Facts in recent years have proved that the spirit of the Five Principles has become an irresistible trend of our times.

The Sino-Indian Friendship Association was founded in Beijing five years ago today by people from the literary and artistic circles of our country. The purpose of the association is to develop friendly relations between China and India and promote cultural and friendly activities between the two countries. The content of the work includes: receiving and assisting relevant groups in receiving Indian delegations and individuals visiting our country, sending and assisting relevant units in sending delegations or individuals to visit India, holding report meetings, exhibitions, film evenings, organizing the translation of Indian literary works, publishing relevant pamphlets, etc. to introduce Indian culture and art, and participating in various work and activities related to Sino-Indian friendship.

In the past five years, we have received and assisted relevant units in receiving about 40 Indian cultural and friendly delegations and individuals visiting China, including two India-China Friendship Association delegations led by Mrs. Uma Nehru and Professor Bapat successively, and delegations and individuals from various fields such as culture, art, medicine and health, teachers and students, law, and sports. These Indian friends have all been warmly welcomed by our government and people. Many experts have also made extensive friends with their Chinese counterparts. In the past few years, our association has sent Sino-Indian Friendship Association delegations to India three times to participate in the meetings of the India-China Friendship Association or to make friendly visits, and has assisted Chinese literary and art, science, and other circles in sending delegations to India to visit, exchange experience, observe and study, etc. All the people who have returned from visiting India told me that during their stay in India, they were not only intoxicated by the magnificent and strange scenery of that great country, but especially the warm hospitality and enthusiastic welcome of the Indian people, which was really indescribable. On this point, I have also had more than one personal experience. When I first visited India in 1951, it has been more than five years now, but I still have to often think of those unforgettable days in India. Now, a moving scene seems to appear before my eyes again: the warm eyes of thousands of Indian people looking at us, countless friendly hands reaching out to us, and an ocean of cheers surrounding us, the slogan "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" has never left my ears. When I visited India for the second time in 1953, there were six of us in total, and in five weeks, we received more than 3,000 garlands, weighing about 3,000 kilograms. The enthusiastic welcome received by the Sino-Indian Friendship Association delegation led by Comrade Wu Han in 1956 was even greater than ours; and the welcoming scenes experienced by Premier Zhou, Vice Chairman Song, the Dalai Lama, and Panchen Erdeni were ten million times greater than ours. How can such enthusiastic and friendly Indian people not be missed! How can one not feel proud to have such a close neighbor!

In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, in addition to organizing people who have visited India to give reports and write articles to introduce the culture, art, and construction achievements of great India, also organizes exhibitions of Indian arts and crafts and photo exhibitions from time to time. 1955 was the 1,500th anniversary of the Ajanta murals, a treasure trove cherished by all mankind. The Sino-Indian Friendship Association, together with other groups, held a commemorative meeting and exhibited the Ajanta murals in Beijing and Shanghai. In 1956, activities were held to commemorate the world cultural celebrity and great Indian poet Kalidasa, introducing his life and works, and now the China Youth Art Theater is performing his poetic drama "Shakuntala." The above activities have left a deep impression on the broad masses of the audience and people in the literary and art circles, and have enabled more Chinese people to have a new understanding of the glorious tradition of Indian national art and the close relationship between the culture and art of China and India.

India, which was once the source of much human wisdom, has many new and old achievements in culture and art. The Chinese people have always admired the cultural traditions and creative genius of the Indian people. Indian works that have been translated into Chinese are appearing in bookstores more and more every day. Prime Minister Nehru's "The Discovery of India," "Nehru's Autobiography," Kalidasa's "Meghaduta," "Shakuntala," Tagore's "The Crescent Moon," "Stray Birds" and the works of Anand and Chakravarti are all loved by our broad readers. Indian songs, dances, and movies are especially fascinating. India has sent three art performing groups to perform in our country, and people especially like the melodious classical songs and the beautiful strings of the "Sitar," and the rich and colorful Bharatanatyam and Kathak dances. In 1955, the Ministry of Culture held an Indian Film Week in 24 large and medium-sized cities in our country, which attracted 3 million viewers in seven days. The audience had a further familiarity and goodwill towards the beautiful mountains and rivers, the rich land, and the intelligent, hardworking, and brave people of the great neighbor, thereby deepening the friendship between the people of the two countries. Our people pay special attention to preserving the characteristics of our national culture, and at the same time respect the long-standing national cultural traditions of other countries. Recently, Premier Zhou, during his visit to India, repeatedly proposed that we should learn from India as sincerely and humbly as our ancestor Xuanzang, and absorb nutrients from their achievements and advanced experience to enrich ourselves. In this way, Sino-Indian friendship can continue to develop with the progress of the times.

In the past five years, although the Sino-Indian Friendship Association has done some things in introducing India's long-standing culture and promoting Sino-Indian friendship, there are many shortcomings, especially some work can not keep up with the development of the objective situation, and can not meet the various requirements put forward by the broad masses of the people due to their love for Indian culture. In the future, we should continue to work hard so that the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the India-China Friendship Association can truly become a link in the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian people. Further consolidating and increasing the friendly relations between the one billion people of China and India will make more and more valuable contributions to the happy life of the people of China and India and world peace.

### 中印友谊之花盛开

    中印友谊之花盛开	中印友好协会会长  丁西林
    用不着去翻阅那些记载在纸张已经发黄的古老史书中的事实，也用不着请历史学家作介绍，只要回顾一下中华人民共和国成立后中国和印度来往的事情，听听越来越加响亮的“印地秦尼巴依巴依”的口号，人们就能深深地体会到中印友谊的花朵已盛开在十亿人民的心坎上。这种花朵不但有光辉的过去，而且有更加灿烂的未来。
    位于中国和印度之间、高达两万多英尺的喜马拉雅山没有阻隔我们祖先发展两国之间的友好关系，今天世界上更没有任何力量能阻挡我们的友谊。从难以确定的年代起，我们两国就进行着友好往来和文化交流。近百年来，两国人民又因受到了殖民主义的侵略，同样进行着争取民族独立的斗争。这种共同的经历，使我们更加互相同情和关怀。而在我们两国先后赢得独立后，两国政府和人民为了实现自己国家的完全独立和经济、文化繁荣，为了维护世界和平所作的共同努力，使彼此间的了解和友谊更为加深，特别是两国总理确定了的和平共处的五项原则，使这种传统的友好关系又在新的基础上发展和巩固。我们之间的文化交流和经济贸易关系大大地加强了，我们之间的互相访问更加频繁了。最使我们感到欢欣鼓舞的是：两国总理倡导的五项原则，不仅得到了万隆会议和亚非人民的广泛支持，同时也得到了其他越来越多的国家和人民的拥护。几年来的事实证明，五项原则的精神已成为我们时代不可抗拒的潮流。
    中印友好协会是在五年前的今天，由我国文学和艺术界人士发起在北京成立的。协会的目的是发展中印两国间的友好关系，促进两国间的文化友好活动。工作的内容包括：接待和协助有关团体接待来我国访问的印度代表团和个人，派遣和协助有关单位派遣代表团或个人到印度访问，举办报告会、展览会、电影晚会，组织翻译印度文学作品，出版有关小册子等介绍印度的文化艺术以及参与中印友好有关的各项工作和活动。
    五年来，我们接待和协助有关单位招待的印度文化友好性的访华代表团和个人有四十起左右，其中包括以乌玛·尼赫鲁夫人和巴帕特教授先后率领的两个印中友好协会代表团和文化、艺术、医药卫生、教师学生、法律、体育等各方面的代表团和个人。这些印度朋友都曾受到我国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。有许多专家还和我国的同行专家广泛的结交了朋友。这几年中，我们协会曾三次派遣了中印友好协会代表团去印度参加印中友协的会议或作友好访问，并曾协助中国文艺、科学等各界人士派遣代表团去印访问、交流经验、观摩学习等。所有从访问印度回来的人士告诉我，他们在印度期间不仅被那个伟大国家壮丽奇异的景色所陶醉，尤其是印度人民盛情的款待和热烈的欢迎，实在无法用言语形容。在这点上，我也有过不止一次的亲身体会。1951年我第一次到印度访问，到现在已经过去五年有余，但我还不得不经常想起我在印度的那些难忘的日子。现在，在我眼前仿佛又呈现出一幅动人的景象：千千万万印度人民热情的眼睛望着我们，无数友谊的手伸向我们，一片欢呼的海洋包围着我们，“印地秦尼巴依巴依”的口号没有离开过耳边。1953年第二次访印时，与我同行的一共是六位，在五个星期内，我们所收到的花环在三千个以上，重量约达三千公斤。1956年吴晗同志率领的那个中印友协代表团比我们受到的热烈欢迎有过之而无不及；而周总理、宋副委员长、达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼等所经历的欢迎场面，又千万倍于我们。这样热情友好的印度人民，怎能不令人思念呢！有这样亲近的邻邦，怎能不令人感到骄傲呢！
    中印友好协会为了满足广大人民的需要，除组织访印人士作报告、写文章来介绍伟大印度的文化、艺术和建设中的成就外，还不时组织印度工艺美术品展览、图片展览。1955年是全世界人类所共同珍爱的宝库——阿旃陀壁画一千五百周年纪念，中印友好协会与其他团体一起举办了纪念会，并在北京、上海展览了阿旃陀壁画。1956年又举办了纪念世界文化名人、印度伟大诗人迦梨陀娑的活动，介绍了他的生平和作品，现在并由中国青年艺术剧院演出他的诗剧“沙恭达罗”。上述活动，在广大观众和文艺界人士中留下了深刻印象，并使更多的中国人民对印度民族艺术的辉煌传统和中印两国文化艺术的密切关系有了新的认识。
    曾经是人类许多智慧渊源的印度，在文化艺术方面有不少新的和老的成就。中国人民一向钦佩印度人民的文化传统和创造天才，目前已经翻译成中文的印度著作，一天比一天更多的出现在书店里。尼赫鲁总理的“印度的发现”、“尼赫鲁自传”，迦梨陀娑的“天使”、“沙恭达罗”，泰戈尔的“新月集”、“飞鸟集”和安纳德、查克拉瓦蒂的作品，都为我们广大读者喜爱。印度的歌舞和电影尤其引人入胜。印度曾有三起艺术表演团来我国演出，人们特别喜欢婉转悠扬的古典歌唱和“锡达尔”的美好音弦，丰富多采的婆罗多、卡达卡尼舞姿。1955年文化部在我国二十四个大、中城市举办了印度电影周，七天的时间内吸引了三百万观众。观众们对伟大邻邦的美丽山河、富饶的土地和聪明、勤劳、勇敢的人民，有了进一步的熟悉和好感，从而加深了两国人民之间的友情。我国人民特别注意保存我国民族文化特点，同时也尊重别国悠久的民族文化传统。最近，周总理在访问印度时，一再提出要我们像我们先人玄奘那样真诚、谦虚地向印度学习，从他们的成就和先进经验中来吸收养料，丰富自己，这样，中印友好就能随着时代的进步而不断的发展。
    五年来，中印友好协会虽然在介绍印度悠久文化、促进中印友好方面做了一些事情，但缺点不少，尤其是某些工作跟不上客观形势的发展，不能多方面满足广大人民因对印度文化热爱而提出的种种要求，今后应该继续努力，使中印友好协会和印中友好协会能真正的成为中国人民和印度人民之间友好关系的链条。中印十亿人民之间友好关系更进一步的巩固和增进，将对中印两国人民的幸福生活和世界和平作出更多更珍贵的贡献。
