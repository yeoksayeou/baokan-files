Get Rid of Bureaucratic Airs!
  　Yuan Shuipai
    It is reported that a comrade unreasonably drove away a photographer at a meeting. Our ancestors would consult the imperial calendar for everything they did, but now some people check their rank for everything they do. Walking and standing in line are all arranged according to rank, as if there is a Chu River boundary everywhere. You should be behind me, how dare you be in front? How can you not understand high and low, noble and base? What does a reporter amount to? My official position is half a sky bigger than yours! "Am I more important, or are you?" This comrade of ours, in a moment of anger, actually unconsciously asked so rudely. He forgot that all citizens are equal. "Hmph! Get out of here!" This comrade of ours, in a moment of indignation, actually unconsciously started scolding people. We hope this was just a temporary lapse. Get out! Right! Should get out! Let these bureaucratic airs, bureaucratic tone,
      corrupt work style, mandarin airs,
      snobbish eyes, suppressing subordinates, flattering superiors... all of them get out, and don't let them harm our comrades anymore! (Attached picture)

    官僚架子滚开！
  　袁水拍
    报载：有同志在一个会场上无理撵走摄影记者。我们祖先做什么都要查皇历，如今有人做什么都要查级别。走路站队一律按级排列，仿佛处处有一道楚河汉界。你该在我后，怎么在前？你怎么不懂得高低贵贱？一个记者算得了什么？我的官儿要比你大半个天！“我重要还是你重要？”我们这位同志一时火冒，竟不自觉地问得这末粗暴。他忘了公民一律平等这一条。“哼！你给我滚开！”我们这位同志一时愤慨，竟不自觉地骂起人来。我们希望这只是他一时失态。滚开！对！应该滚开！让这些官僚架子，官僚腔，
      腐朽作风，老爷气派，
      势利眼，对下压，对上拍……一古脑儿都滚开，不许它们再把我们的同志害！（附图片）
