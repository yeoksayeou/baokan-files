    Limit Scale, Control Land Use, Lower Standards:
    Xi'an Begins to Correct Wasteful Practices in Urban Construction
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, May 12th dispatch) Xi'an city construction departments, recently, with the assistance of the State Construction Commission and the Ministry of Urban Construction's working group, and in accordance with the principle of building the nation diligently and thriftily, conducted an inspection and summary of the city's construction work over the past few years, and proposed a preliminary plan to improve urban construction work.

    This plan takes "facing reality, facing the masses, making do with what is available, and building diligently and thriftily" as its guiding principles.

    The plan first calls for controlling the scale of the city and urban land use. It suggests that relevant central departments no longer build new enterprises and schools in Xi'an, and appropriately limit the development scale of factories and schools that have already begun construction. It also suggests that relevant departments in Xi'an find ways to control the population growth scale. In addition, it was decided to strictly control urban land use. Within five to ten years, the urban area will be controlled within the already formed range, and no further expansion will be allowed. Currently, the allocation of land outwards will generally be stopped, and the wasted land will be dealt with separately immediately. It has now been decided and is being implemented to return more than 10,000 mu of land to farmers for cultivation. Blocks with excessively low building density will be appropriately filled in, and some housing or public welfare facilities will be added. The originally planned public greening will be appropriately reduced. The management of construction land will also be strengthened.

    Construction standards will be appropriately lowered. The living area quota will no longer be planned according to nine square meters per person. Depending on the amount of construction and land conditions in different areas, the proportion of bungalows and low-standard two-story buildings will be appropriately increased in some areas. The area of ​​squares, etc. will be appropriately reduced. Residential and public service facilities will make full use of local building materials, make do with what is available, further reduce construction costs, and advocate for the construction of more simple buildings. Civil administration buildings will not take earthquake-resistant and air-raid precautions. The school land quota, hygiene standards, and civil air defense standards, which are too high and too large, are recommended that the relevant central departments study and revise them.

    Public utility projects will be re-arranged according to their importance and urgency. According to preliminary calculations, Xi'an's water supply problem can be completely solved by underground water sources, and the Wangchuan Reservoir will no longer be built, which may save the state 40 million yuan in funds. According to the actual needs, the sewage treatment plant may not be expanded during the second five-year plan period. In the near future, basically no new roads will be opened, and all the roads that have been opened, except for some important traffic arteries, will be temporarily suspended from paving high-grade road surfaces.

    The plan also decides to re-examine and revise the urban plan in accordance with the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily. In principle, the Hongqing District, Textile District, and Weibin District, which are far from the old city, should be planned as separate workers' towns and built according to low standards; in the near future, the eastern, western, and southern suburbs should also be planned by districts, and housing and public service facilities should be constructed by districts, without rushing to connect them into one piece. The old city area will basically not be rebuilt within five to ten years. The original houses, roads and other public facilities in the old city area should be fully utilized and their maintenance and management should be strengthened. In addition, the plan puts forward several issues that should be paid attention to when revising the plan: conscientiously pay attention to combining with the terrain to avoid increasing the amount of earthwork; according to the principle of district planning, evenly distribute public service facilities to prevent excessive concentration and create inconvenience for residents; strengthen short-term construction planning and pay attention to the construction of large areas.

    Currently, Xi'an's urban construction departments are specifically inspecting the urban plan according to this plan and studying specific measures to improve urban construction work.

### 限制规模　控制用地　降低标准  西安市着手纠正城市建设中的浪费现象

    限制规模　控制用地　降低标准
    西安市着手纠正城市建设中的浪费现象
    本报西安12日电　西安市城市建设部门，最近在国家建设委员会、城市建设部工作组的帮助之下，根据勤俭建国的方针，对几年来的城市建设工作进行了检查总结，提出了改进城市建设工作的初步方案。
    这个方案，是以“面向实际，面向群众，因陋就简，勤俭建设”作为指导原则的。
    方案中首先要求对城市规模和城市用地加以控制。建议中央有关部门不再在西安增建企业和学校，对开始建设的工厂、学校的发展规模加以适当限制，建议西安各有关部门也设法控制人口发展规模，此外，决定在城市用地方面要严加控制。五年到十年内，将把市区控制在已经形成的范围以内，不再继续向外扩展。目前，一般地停止向外拨地，并要立即对浪费的土地分别加以处理。现在已经决定并着手退交农民耕种的土地，共有一万多亩。建筑密度过低的街坊，将适当地填空补实，增建一些住宅或公共福利设施。原规划的公共绿化等将适当缩小。建筑用地的管理工作也将加强。
    建设标准将适当降低。居住面积定额不再按照每人九平方公尺进行规划。根据不同地区的建筑量和土地情况，有的地区将适当增加平房和低标准二层建筑的建筑比例。广场面积等将适当缩小。住宅和公共服务设施，将充分利用地方建筑材料，因陋就简，进一步降低建筑造价，并提倡多盖简易建筑。民政建筑将不采取防震、防空措施。学校用地定额、卫生标准、人防标准等偏高偏大的部分，建议中央有关部门研究修改。
    公用事业工程，将分别轻重缓急，重新安排。据初步计算，西安市的供水问题可以完全由地下水源解决，不再修建辋川水库，这便可能为国家节约资金四千万元。污水处理厂，根据实际需要情况，第二个五年计划期间可以不再扩建。近期内基本上不再增辟新的道路，已经开辟的道路，除部分重要交通干道外，一律暂缓铺装高级路面。
    方案中还决定根据勤俭建国的方针，重新审查和修改城市规划。原则上，离旧城很远的洪庆区、纺织区、渭滨区分别按单独的工人镇进行规划，并按低标准进行修建；东郊、西郊、南郊，近期内也要分区规划，分区建设住宅和公共服务设施，不急于连成一片。旧城区，五年到十年内基本上不再进行改建。旧城区原有的房屋、道路和其他公用设施，要充分利用并加强维护管理。另外，方案中提出了修改规划时应该注意的几个问题：切实注意结合地形，避免增加土方工程量；根据分区规划的原则，均匀分布公共服务设施，防止过分集中，为居民造成不便；加强近期修建规划，注意成片建设。
    目前，西安市城市建设部门正在根据这一方案，具体检查城市规划，研究改进城市建设工作的各项具体措施。
