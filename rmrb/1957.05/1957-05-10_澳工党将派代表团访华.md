Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, 9th. Australian Labor Party leader, Evatt, announced on the 8th that the Australian Labor Party had accepted an invitation from the Chinese side to send a four-member delegation from the Australian Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to visit China.

It is announced that the delegation is scheduled to travel in June for approximately four weeks. The delegation members will be decided at a meeting on May 15th. Evatt said that he would not be able to join the delegation because he would be going to London to attend the Commonwealth Labor Party Conference. Evatt said that the Australian Labor Party's policy has consistently advocated recognizing the People's Republic of China and supporting its entry into the United Nations. He said: "I absolutely believe that from the point of view of trade and friendly relations between the two countries, it is very bad that this cannot be done in the long run."

    澳工党将派代表团访华
    新华社9日讯　堪培拉消息：澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特8日宣布，澳大利亚工党已经接受中国方面的邀请，将派出一个澳大利亚联邦议会工党党团四人代表团到中国进行访问。
    据宣布，代表团的行程预定是在6月，历时大约四个星期。代表团人选将于5月15日开会决定。伊瓦特说，由于他要到伦敦去出席英联邦工党会议，因此不能参加代表团。伊瓦特说，澳大利亚工党的政策一贯主张承认中华人民共和国，并且支持它进入联合国。他说：“我绝对相信，从贸易和两国之间的友好关系的观点看来，长期不能作到这点是非常不好的。”
