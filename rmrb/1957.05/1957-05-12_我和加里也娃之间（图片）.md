    Between Galiyeva and Me
    I met Galiyeva① at my work post. After a few days together, we became very good friends②. She signed a souvenir for me③. We admired Moscow scenery postcards together with female soloist Turigeyeva④. One Friday, while visiting the Summer Palace, she asked meritorious actress Faji Ma to take pictures of many of us⑤.
    Old service worker comrades are very active in helping new comrades.
    The hotel's amateur middle school is run very well.
    I rest every Friday. On this day off, I go back to my aunt's house to help her with laundry, or listen to the radio with my aunt and sister. Sometimes I go boating in the park.

    我和加里也娃之间
    我在工作岗位上认识了加里也娃①。几天的相处，成了很要好的朋友②。她为我签名留念③。我们和女独唱家图里格也娃一同欣赏莫斯科风景画片④。一个星期五，在颐和园游园时，她请功勋演员法纪玛给我们许多人照了照片⑤。
    老服务员同志帮助新同志非常积极。
    饭店的业余中学办得很好。
    我每星期五休息。在休息的这一天，回到大妈家里帮助大妈洗洗衣服，或者和大妈、妹妹一起听收音机。有时候也去公园划划船。
