(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Eighty physicists from the Physical Society of Japan passed a resolution at a meeting on May 19th, expressing their refusal to participate in the work of testing and manufacturing nuclear weapons.

These scholars from universities such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Rikkyo stated in the resolution that they fully support the "Göttingen Declaration" published by eighteen West German atomic physicists in April, which called for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

The resolution pointed out that the prior registration system for nuclear weapons tests advocated by the Japanese government is meaningless because this method cannot eliminate the dangers caused by nuclear weapons.

The resolution also pointed out that the statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in the Diet not long ago that Japan possessing nuclear weapons "does not violate the constitution" is wrong.

Prior to this, twenty-five Japanese atomic physicists, including Hideki Yukawa, had already issued a joint statement, expressing their refusal to participate in the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons.

In the United Kingdom, the Council of the Association of Scientific Workers, representing 12,000 British scientific workers, passed a resolution on May 19th, calling on the heads of government of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, India, China, and the Soviet Union to hold a meeting to discuss the prohibition of the manufacture and use of atomic weapons.

Another resolution passed at the meeting expressed regret over the British government's actions in conducting nuclear weapons explosion tests.

The scientists also paid tribute to the eighteen prominent West German scientists who refused to engage in the production of atomic nuclear weapons and hoped that scientists from all countries would follow their example.

The Socialist Medical Association also unanimously passed a resolution on the same day opposing the government's continued nuclear weapons testing and demanded that immediate steps be taken to reach an agreement between the major powers on disarmament.

The renowned philosopher and scientist Bertrand Russell, Earl Russell, in a television talk in London on his eighty-fifth birthday (May 17), said that he fully opposed hydrogen bomb testing.

Russell said: He would like to see a major power, preferably the United Kingdom, issue a unilateral declaration to the world that it will abandon all future testing.

In India, indignation in public opinion against the British explosion of the hydrogen bomb continues to rise. Many newspapers are calling for the launch of a powerful movement against hydrogen bomb testing.

Members of Parliament have also been conducting heated discussions on this issue. According to newspaper reports, when Menon presents a proposal against testing in the People's House on May 22nd, it will receive unanimous support from all sides of Parliament. This proposal will call upon countries possessing atomic nuclear weapons to reach an agreement to "stop without delay" all atomic nuclear explosions.

In the United States, the "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, stating that there has been a dramatic change in American public opinion recently regarding the demand to stop continuing hydrogen bomb tests. In a recent opinion poll conducted by the American Institute of Public Opinion, 63% of adults favored banning such tests, while last fall, only 24% favored the proposal made by former Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson to stop testing nuclear weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th - According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, Moroccan nationalist leader Khatib issued a statement in Cairo on the 18th, accusing the Moroccan government of negotiating with the United States to establish atomic air force bases in Morocco.

Khatib said that the Moroccan people are willing to live independently without the influence of foreign forces and adhere to a policy of active neutrality.

    要求禁止氢弹试验呼声日益高涨
    日本物理学家表示不参与制造核武器
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本物理学会的八十位物理学家5月19日在一次会议上通过决议，表示拒绝参与试验和制造核武器的工作。
    这些东京、大阪、立教等大学的学者们在决议中表示完全支持十八位西德原子物理学家在4月发表的“戈丁根宣言”，要求禁止核武器。
    决议指出，日本政府主张的核武器试验事先登记制是没有意义的，因为这种办法不能消除核武器所造成的危险。
    决议并且指出，日本首相岸信介不久前在国会里所说日本拥有核武器“不违反宪法”的发言是错误的。
    在这以前，已经有汤川秀树等二十五位日本原子物理学家发表联合声明，表示拒绝参与制造、试验核武器。
    在英国，代表一万二千名英国科学工作者的科学工作者协会理事会会议5月19日通过决议，要求英国、法国、美国、印度、中国和苏联政府首脑举行会议，讨论禁止制造和使用原子武器。
    会议通过的另一项决议对英国政府进行核武器爆炸试验的行动表示遗憾。
    科学家们还对拒绝从事原子核武器生产的十八位西德著名科学家致敬，并且希望各国科学家效法他们的榜样。
    社会主义者医学协会会议同日也一致通过了反对政府继续进行核武器试验的决议，并且要求立即采取步骤在大国之间就裁军问题取得协议。
    著名的哲学家和科学家伯特朗德·罗素伯爵在他八十五岁生日（5月17日）的一天在伦敦发表电视谈话说：他全力反对氢弹试验。
    罗素说：他愿意看到一个大国，最好是英国，向全世界发表一个单方面的宣言：它将放弃未来所有的试验。
    在印度，舆论界反对英国爆炸氢弹的愤慨情绪不断高涨。许多报纸要求发动反对氢弹试验的强大运动。
    议员们也一直在就这个问题进行热烈的讨论，据报纸消息说，梅农5月22日在人民院提出反对试验的提案时将得到议会各方面的一致支持。这个提案将吁请拥有原子核武器的国家达成协议，“毫不迟延地停止”一切原子核爆炸。
    在美国，“纽约先驱论坛报”刊载美国民意研究所所长盖洛普的一篇文章说，对于要求停止继续进行氢弹试验，美国舆论最近发生了剧烈的变化。在美国民意研究所刚举行的民意测验中，有63％的成年人赞成禁止这种试验，而在去年秋天，只有24％的人赞成前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森提出的关于停止试验核武器的建议。
    新华社开罗20日电　据中东通讯社报道，摩洛哥民族运动领袖哈蒂布18日在开罗发表声明，指责摩洛哥政府同美国谈判在摩洛哥建立原子空军基地。
    哈蒂布说，摩洛哥人民愿意不受外国势力的影响独立地生活并且坚持积极中立政策。
