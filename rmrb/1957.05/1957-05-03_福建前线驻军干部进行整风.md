Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd - The leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front convened a meeting of leading cadres from various arms of service and departments on April 29 to discuss issues related to carrying out the rectification movement. The cadres present believed that the foundation of the rectification movement is to thoroughly study Chairman Mao's report; the CCP committees at all levels in the Fujian front troops must currently concentrate their efforts on leading this study.

During the discussion, it was felt that the method of studying Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people adopted by the troops stationed in the Xiamen area was an example of a good start to the rectification movement. This unit held an enlarged Party committee meeting with the participation of cadres at the regimental level and above on April 21, listened to the report of Chairman Mao's report and the reports of General Tan Zheng, General Ye Fei, Lieutenant General Liu Peishan, and others on the correct handling of contradictions within the army, and systematically and meticulously reviewed the main problems existing in the unit's work, promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. On the basis of reviewing the work, the cadres present further studied the documents and launched extensive discussions in conjunction with the work of their respective units. Leading cadres at all levels of this unit are also preparing to go to various units to give reports to soldiers, and at the same time conduct detailed investigations and research by living with soldiers and soliciting their opinions. When all units have a full understanding and awareness of the main problems in their respective units, an enlarged Party committee meeting with the participation of a large number of cadres will be held to study how to improve the leadership style through criticism and self-criticism.

Currently, cadres at the regimental level and above, and most organs above the regimental level, are adopting various forms such as short-term training, half-day study systems, or convening enlarged Party committee meetings to earnestly study Chairman Mao's report.

    福建前线驻军干部进行整风
    据新华社福建前线2日电  福建前线中国人民解放军领导机关在4月29日召集各兵种、各部门领导干部，讨论开展整风运动等有关问题。到会干部认为，整风运动的基础是学习好毛主席的报告；福建前线部队中的中共各级党委，目前必须集中力量领导这一学习。
    大家在讨论中认为，驻厦门地区部队学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告的方法，是整风运动良好开端的一例。这个部队在4月21日召开了有团以上干部参加的党委扩大会，听取了毛主席报告的传达和谭政大将、叶飞上将、刘培善中将等关于正确处理军队内部矛盾的报告，并且系统地细致地检查了本部队工作中存在的主要问题，发扬了民主，开展了批评和自我批评。在检查工作的基础上，到会干部又深入学习文件，并结合本单位工作展开广泛的讨论。这个部队的各级领导干部还准备分赴各部队，一面向士兵作报告，一面通过同士兵一起生活、征求士兵们的意见来作细致的调查研究工作。当各部队对本单位的主要问题有了充分了解和认识以后，再召开有广大干部参加的党委扩大会，通过批评和自我批评，来研究改进领导作风。
    现在，团以上干部和大部分团以上机关，正在采取短期集训、半日学习制或召开党委扩大会等各种形式，认真地学习毛主席的报告。
