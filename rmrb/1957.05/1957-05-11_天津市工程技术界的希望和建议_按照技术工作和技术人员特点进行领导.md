People's Daily Special Manuscript, Xinhua News Agency Reporter Meng Fan, Qian Ermei reports: Recently, reporters contacted nine engineers who raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the current technical leadership work.

Technical Decisions Should Also Involve "Contention"

    At present, technical decisions are not made within enterprises but are concentrated in central ministries and administrations. However, the ministries and administrations suffer from bureaucracy, often failing to visit the field and collaborate with enterprise technical personnel. They hastily make decisions based on unrealistic information. Qian Duanyou, an engineer at the Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant, pointed out that when their plant's reconstruction project was more than 60% complete, the Construction Director from the ministry came to the plant to try to "dismount" the project. The plant leadership and technical personnel disagreed, believing that "dismounting" should depend on conditions. They collected materials and prepared to submit a detailed report. However, the director did not listen to the plant's report, wrote a note to the plant stating that the project had been decided to be "dismounted," all construction work was to be stopped, materials were to be sold, and personnel were to be transferred. Then, he hurriedly returned to Beijing. Plant cadres believed that this decision was very subjective, not only impractical but also causing losses to the state. They reported the detailed situation to the central authorities, and the problem was resolved. He proposed that future decisions on policies and technical matters should fully involve "contention," organizing everyone to debate and see who speaks most reasonably. Now, the words of technical personnel carry great weight, and carelessness would be a disservice to the country.

Unemployment and No One to Do the Work

    Many engineers believe that there are many technical personnel in the central ministries and administrations who have little to do, while enterprises, especially local enterprises, have a lot of work but no one to do it. Engineer Qian Duanyou said that the Academy of Sciences has a backlog of many university graduates, but enterprises cannot get even one. In state-owned enterprises, technical personnel are layered upon layered, and their strength cannot be brought into play. Some are underutilized. But the technical personnel in local industries are pitifully few, and a graduate of a secondary technical school is treated like a saint. He believes that the improvement of the technical level of local industries is currently not limited by equipment but by people. Our country has so many local industries; why not organize a group of technical cadres, transform and improve them, and make full use of them?

"Omnipotent" and "Incompetent"

    The leading personnel of many enterprises rarely contact technical personnel and do not understand them well. Bao Zhuoquan, an engineer at the Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau, said that the scope of the mechanical and electrical industry is very broad, and each engineering and technical personnel has their own expertise. But the leadership often does not consider these factors. If you study mechanics, they put you in the mechanical industry. According to his understanding, an engineer worked in a telecommunications manufacturing factory for more than ten years after graduating from university. But the leadership transferred him to the bureau to engage in unfamiliar mechanical design, which caused more than a year of emotional distress. Xie Yinien, an engineer at the Tianjin Heavy Industry Bureau, believes that some leading cadres' views on technical personnel are either "omnipotent" or "incompetent."

    Some leading departments provide a lot of care to some advanced technical personnel, truly "adding flowers to the brocade," while less effort is made to "send charcoal in the snow" to some technical personnel who are considered backward. Engineer Bao Zhuoquan said: If he is advanced, it is right to take care of him. But for those who have problems with their thinking, they should also be analyzed, enlightened, and helped. But now, they are let go and ignored. This is not Marxism-Leninism. Most people with ideological problems have opinions about their work, not opposition to socialism. Leading cadres consider this aspect less. He hopes that they can "add flowers to the brocade" and also "send charcoal in the snow."

Change the "Campaign-Style" Leadership

    Engineers reflect that the leadership of technical work in many enterprises is "campaign-style." Engineer Bao Zhuoquan believes that technical work is long-term and requires careful analysis. "Campaign-style" leadership is unlikely to be effective. He said: An engineer in a wire factory developed a new product close to the world level, talked to the leadership, but did not attract attention. Later, central scientific research institutions and many regions such as Shanghai sent people to understand. The leadership felt that the problem was important and should be supported. So, they held a large meeting to commend and give bonuses, all of which were political. But the raw materials and other issues needed for the trial production of the new product that the engineer was most concerned about were not resolved. Not long ago, calcium carbide was gone. The engineer himself borrowed a little from other factories through personal relationships, so that the research work was not interrupted. Engineer Qian Duanyou believes that it is certainly a good thing to set up canteens and find houses for technical personnel. But what technical personnel urgently need is to have something to do and to be supported. Every technical personnel has their own ambition. If they cannot produce anything, they will still be emotional, no matter how well their lives are taken care of.

Where to March?

    How to carry out scientific research work in enterprises? These engineers unanimously believe that it must be combined with production, but there must be long-term plans and specific leadership. Engineer Ying Yuanzai of the Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau said that whether last year or this year, the scientific research projects determined in enterprises are all current problems and lack long-term plans. He believes that local industrial technical personnel are not many. At present, the work needs to be taken care of, and a few people can be concentrated on studying longer-term issues. For example, the shortage of raw materials is not only a current problem but also an important issue for the development of the textile industry in the next few years. Developing man-made fibers is a direction, but it needs the leadership to affirm it. Some engineers hope that the leadership can assign marching tasks to technical personnel at all levels. Wang Chuanyu, an engineer at the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, said: In the past, I did some technical improvements, which were all tasks given by the leadership. The goals were clear, and the enthusiasm was great. Now, just shouting about marching, how to march? Where to march? There is no direction. If you go on your own, you are worried about carrying the burden of individual heroism and purely technical viewpoints.

Conditions and Environment

    Wang Bin, an engineer at Tianjin Rubber Factory No. 1, said: Everyone is very excited to march towards science. How can we march without anything? If you want to research, the equipment cannot keep up. It is either that there is money but no materials, or there are materials but no money. There are too few scientific books and magazines in enterprises and too many meetings. He cited this year's deployment of the increase production and practice economy campaign as an example: the city held a mobilization meeting once, the bureau once, the district once, and the factory once. It is just one thing over and over again. Why can't it be implemented to the end at once? Engineer Xie Yinien believes that the leadership should give technical personnel some time to read books. He said: The workers of Tianjin Dyestuff and Chemical Factory No. 5 learned to manufacture new products from the technical personnel. But after a year, the workers gained a lot of experience from production, raised some questions, and stumped the technical personnel. He believes that some old technical personnel have already forgotten a lot of what they learned in the past. They should be given some time to restore what they have lost. This is also a way to invest little and get big results.

Care About People

    These engineers believe that there is a gap and lack of closeness between the Party and technical personnel. Some engineers have worked in the bureau for several years and still do not know who the Party secretary is. Some engineers hope that the Party will often contact technical personnel, not just come to hold meetings and report when the superiors come to inspect, and then forget about it. Some engineers also believe that there is sectarianism in the Party organizations of the central industrial ministries and enterprises. For example, those who are sent abroad for inspections are all from the central ministries and bureaus, and even some who have no technical ability go for inspections, which is equivalent to satisfying personal travel desires. However, those who preside over technical work in enterprises do not have the opportunity.

    Some engineers believe that too few Party members have been developed among technical personnel in recent years. Engineer Cheng Xiubiao of the Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau believes that the wage adjustment last year really broke the rules. General cadres are promoted very quickly, and some are promoted beyond their level. But engineering and technical personnel are rarely promoted. He said: There are no chief engineers in the bureau and factory now. Why can't technical personnel be given more responsibility? I heard that to be a chief engineer, you must join the Party and graduate from the Marxism-Leninism Academy. Later, after inquiring, it was not the case at all, but the leadership did not believe in the thinking of technical personnel.

Be Frank and Open

    Some engineers suggest that the Party and technical personnel should get along frankly and openly, saying whatever they have to say. Liu Xingzong, an engineer at Tianjin Power Plant No. 1, believes that if technical personnel have shortcomings or mistakes in their work, the Party should point them out, tell them what to pay attention to, and how to do it correctly. If the masses have opinions on technical personnel, the Party should also promptly inform them. Engineer Chen Guozhen of the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory believes that the Party organization should help technical personnel establish prestige in their work. He proposed that there are three unacceptable practices for Party member leading cadres to treat technical personnel: First, some leading cadres enter the workshop and hear the workers' reflections. Without investigation and analysis, they find the technical personnel and criticize them in front of the workers. Second, on the wall newspaper, while praising worker so-and-so, they also criticize technical personnel so-and-so. Third, if technical personnel have mistakes, do not name them in a large meeting if they can be said to them alone. Sometimes, even if the name is not mentioned, everyone knows who it is as soon as the specific matter is mentioned, and they start to criticize. The criticized person is also not easy to defend himself. The attitude of criticism should be serious, so that the criticized person feels that it is caring for him, not ridiculing him. The practice of not taking the criticized person seriously, criticizing while talking and laughing with others, is unacceptable.

    天津市工程技术界的希望和建议
    按照技术工作和技术人员特点进行领导
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者孟帆、钱尔梅报道：最近记者接触了九位工程师，他们对目前的技术领导工作提出了许多批评和建议。
    技术决策也要“争鸣”
    现在的技术决策不在企业，而是集中在中央部和管理局。但是，部、局有官僚主义，往往不到现场，不和企业技术人员共同研究，就根据一些不切实际的资料草率决定。天津拖拉机制造厂工程师钱端有提出，当他们工厂的改建工程已完成了60％以上的时候，部里派基建司长来厂要拉“下马”。工厂领导方面和技术人员不同意，认为“下马”要看条件，并收集了材料，准备作详细汇报。但是这位司长没有听工厂的汇报，写个纸条通知工厂，说这项工程已决定“下马”，全部土建工程停止，材料卖出，人员外调，就匆匆返京了。工厂干部认为这种决定是非常主观的，不仅行不通，还会给国家造成损失。他们向中央汇报了详细情况，问题才得到解决。他提出：今后决定方针和技术政策，应该充分“争鸣”，组织大家辩论，看谁说得有理。现在技术人员一言重千金，不慎重就会对不起国家。
    没事干和没人干
    许多工程师认为：目前在中央部和管理局里技术人员很多，没有多少事情干；而企业，特别是地方企业，事情很多，却没有人干。钱端有工程师说：科学院积压着许多大学毕业生；企业里却一个也分不到。国营企业中技术人员一层压一层，力量得不到发挥，有些屈才；而地方工业的技术人员少得可怜，一个中等技术学校的毕业生就当圣人。他认为：地方工业提高技术水平，目前不是受设备限制，而是受人的限制。我们国家有这样多地方工业，为什么不组织一批技术干部，加以改造、提高，充分利用起来？
   “万能”和“无能”
    许多企业的领导人员平时很少和技术人员接触，对技术人员的了解不够。天津机电工业局包卓权工程师说：机电工业的范围很广，每个工程技术人员又各有专长，但是领导方面往往不考虑这些，一看你是学机械的，就往机械行业一塞了事。据他了解：有位工程师大学毕业后在电讯制造厂工作了十多年，可是领导方面把他调到局里搞生疏的机械设计，以致闹了一年多情绪。天津重工业局工程师谢颐年认为有些领导干部对技术人员的看法就是这样：不是“万能”就是“无能”。
    有些领导部门对一些先进的技术人员照顾很多，确是“锦上添花”，而对一些认为落后的技术人员“雪里送炭”的工作则做得少。包卓权工程师说：他先进，你照顾他是应该的，但对那些思想上有问题的人也应该加以分析，启发他，帮助他。但是，现在是让他去，不管他。这不是马克思列宁主义。大部分思想有问题的人都是对工作有意见，而不是反对社会主义，领导干部从这方面考虑得少。他希望能够“锦上添花”，也能够“雪里送炭”。
    改变“运动式”的领导
    工程师们反映，许多企业对技术工作的领导是“运动式”的。包卓权工程师认为：技术工作是长期的，要细致分析，“运动式”的领导不易有成效。他说：一个电线厂的工程师搞了一种接近世界水平的新产品，和领导谈了，没有引起注意。后来，中央科学研究机关和上海等许多地区都派人来了解，领导方面感到问题重要了，应该给予支持，于是开大会表扬，发奖金，都是政治性的，而这位工程师最关心的新产品试制需要的原料等问题却没有得到解决。不久前，电石没有了，还是这位工程师自己通过私人关系，从其他厂借到了一点，才使研究工作没有中断。钱端有工程师认为：为技术人员办食堂、找房子，当然是好事，但是技术人员最迫切需要的是有事做，并得到支持。每个技术人员都有自己的抱负，搞不出东西，生活照顾得再好也还是闹情绪。
    往哪里进军？
    企业中怎样开展科学研究工作？这些工程师们一致认为必须结合生产，但是要有长远打算，要有具体领导。天津市纺织工业局应元栽工程师说：不管去年也好，今年也好，企业中确定的科学研究项目都是当前的问题，缺乏长远打算。他认为地方工业技术人员不多，目前工作要照顾，可以集中少数人研究比较长远的问题。如原料不足不仅是当前，也是今后几年纺织工业发展的重要问题，搞人造纤维是个方向，但需要领导肯定下来。有些工程师希望领导方面逐级向技术人员布置进军任务。天津纺织机械厂王传钰工程师说：过去我搞过一些技术改进，那都是领导给任务，目标明确、劲头也大。现在，光喊叫进军，怎么进法？往哪里进？没有方向。如果自己去搞，又担心背上个人英雄主义、单纯技术观点的包袱。
    条　件　和　环　境
    天津橡胶一厂工程师王斌说：要向科学进军大家很兴奋，没有东西可怎么进法？要研究，设备跟不上，不是有钱没东西，就是有东西没钱。企业中科学书籍、杂志太少，会议太多。他以今年布置开展增产节约运动为例：市里开会动员一次，局里一次，区里一次，到厂还有一次。反来复去的就是一件事，为什么不能一下子贯彻到底？谢颐年工程师认为领导上应该给一定时间叫技术人员看看书。他说：天津染化五厂工人从技术人员那里学会了制造新产品，可是过了一年，工人从生产中得到很多经验，提出一些问题，把技术人员考住了。他认为有些老技术人员已经把过去学过的丢下很多了，应该给些时间叫他们把丢的恢复起来，这也是投资小、收效大的办法。
    要　关　心　人
    这些工程师认为党和技术人员的关系有隔阂、不密切。有的工程师在局里工作了几年，还不知谁是党委书记。有的工程师希望党经常跟技术人员接触，不要上级检查了才来开会、报告，过去了事。也有些工程师认为中央工业部和企业中党组织存在着宗派主义，如派往国外考查的都是中央部、局的人，甚至有些没有技术能力的也去考查，等于满足了个人的旅行愿望。而在企业中主持技术工作的人却没有机会。
    有些工程师认为，几年来在技术人员中间发展党员太少。天津机电工业局工程师程秀标认为：去年调整工资真是打破了清规，一般干部提拔很快，有的越级提升，但是工程技术人员很少提拔。他说：现在局、厂都没有总工程师，为什么不能叫技术人员多负些责任呢？听人说：当总工程师必须入党、从马列学院毕业的。后来一打听，根本不是那么回事，而是领导不相信技术人员的思想在作怪。
    要开诚布公
    有些工程师建议党和技术人员相处要开诚布公，有什么说什么。天津发电一厂刘兴宗工程师认为技术人员工作有缺点、有错误，党应该给指出来，告诉他注意什么，怎样做才对；群众对技术人员有意见，党也应该及时转告。天津印染厂工程师陈国珍认为党组织应该帮助技术人员在工作中建立威信。他提出党员领导干部对待技术人员有三种做法要不得：第一，有的领导干部进了车间听到工人的反映，不进行调查分析，把技术人员找来当着工人面批评一顿。第二，在墙报上，一边表扬工人某某，另一边又批评技术人员某某。第三，技术人员有错误，能单独说的就不要在大会上点名。有时虽然不点名，一说具体事大家也知道是谁，就批评起来，被批评者也不好辩白。批评的态度应该严肃，使被批评者感到是关心他，而不是讥笑他。那种把批评人不当回事，一面批评、一面又和别人谈笑的做法要不得。
