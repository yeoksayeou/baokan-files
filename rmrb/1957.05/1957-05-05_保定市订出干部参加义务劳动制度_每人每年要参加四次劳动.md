Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th: The Baoding City Voluntary Labor Committee, Hebei Province, convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd with relevant personnel from Party and government organizations, troops, and groups stationed in Baoding. Based on the recently formulated plan for cadres to participate in voluntary labor this year, specific tasks were assigned to each unit, and a voluntary labor system was established. This system stipulates that cadres in each unit (including students from secondary schools and above), with the exception of the elderly, sick, and those on business trips, will participate in an average of four voluntary labor sessions per year, with each session lasting four hours. According to this regulation, more than 30,000 people this year (approximately half of the total number of people in these units) will participate in voluntary labor. The content of the voluntary labor includes helping agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs with various farm tasks such as preparing for plowing, spring planting, wheat harvesting, and autumn harvesting, as well as participating in municipal construction projects such as road repair, dike building, and ditch clearing.

Since February, more than 20,000 cadres from various organizations and groups stationed in Baoding City have participated in voluntary labor in agricultural cooperatives in the city's suburbs, working alongside cooperative members to accumulate and transport fertilizer, manage wheat fields, and sow crops.

    保定市订出干部参加义务劳动制度
    每人每年要参加四次劳动
    据新华社保定4日电　河北省保定市义务劳动委员会3日下午召集驻保定市党政机关、部队和团体的有关人员举行会议，根据最近制订的本年度干部参加义务劳动的计划，具体分配任务给各单位，并订出了义务劳动制度。这个制度规定，各单位的干部（包括中等以上学校学生在内）除去年老、有病、出差等人员外，平均每人全年参加四次义务劳动，每人每次劳动四小时。根据这个规定，今年将有三万多人（占这些单位总人数半数左右）参加义务劳动。义务劳动的内容是帮助郊区农业社做备耕、春播、麦收、秋收等多种农活，和参加修路、筑堤、整理沟道等市政建设工程。
    从2月份起，驻保定市各机关团体干部已有二万多人次先后到市郊各农业社参加义务劳动，和社员们一起积肥送粪、管理麦田、播种庄稼等。
