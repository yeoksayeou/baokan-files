　　Xi'an, May 1st (People's Daily) - Our reporter Zhu Bo reports: After receiving the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on the rectification movement on April 30th, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee held an emergency meeting of the Secretariat that evening to specifically study how to implement the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. Then, at 8:00 AM on May 1st, an emergency meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee was held to specifically study the opinions put forward by the Secretariat. A preliminary plan for carrying out the rectification movement in Party organizations at all levels throughout the province was determined.

　　Both meetings unanimously agreed that it is extremely necessary to immediately begin the rectification. According to the situation in Shaanxi Province, in recent years, bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, which are detached from the masses and reality, have grown anew within the Party. Recently, more than 300,000 Party and non-Party cadres and intellectuals across the province, in discussing how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, have exposed many problems in actual work and some muddled views on contradictions among the people. These problems urgently need to be resolved.

　　At the meetings, the steps and methods for carrying out the rectification movement in Party organizations in various organs, organizations, large factories, mines, and major universities and colleges above the county level in the province were repeatedly studied. It was decided that the rectification movement will be carried out in two batches this year. The first batch includes the Party organizations of the Provincial Party Committee, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committees, as well as large factories, mines, and universities. The second batch will be the Party organizations of various departments at the county level. Other district and township cadres and Party members will carry out the rectification movement in batches next year. Starting in early May, responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee will, according to the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions and in conjunction with the situation in the region, give mobilization reports on launching the rectification movement. From now on, democratic life will be immediately expanded in organs, large factories, mines, and universities to listen to the masses' opinions on the leading departments, and leaders at all levels who are able to engage in physical labor will be organized to participate in labor.

　　The rectification will first begin with the Party organizations of provincial-level organs, Xi'an City, and prefectural-level organs, with the time initially set at four and a half months. Then, the county Party committees will gradually begin to carry out the rectification, with the time initially set at four months each. In Party organizations of all levels of organs, organizations, factories, mines, and schools, the rectification will first begin with Party leaders, and then proceed among general staff. The specific method is that leaders will be divided into batches to concentrate on studying Chairman Mao's two reports at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on the rectification movement, and referring to documents such as "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." The study time for each batch of leaders will be two weeks. From mid-June, Party organizations at all levels will begin to conduct inspections one after another. While the leaders are concentrating on studying, the general staff in Party organizations at all levels will also stop their theoretical study and focus on studying the aforementioned documents in preparation for carrying out a comprehensive inspection.

　　The meetings believed that the Provincial Party Committee, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committees, and the County Party Committees must conduct inspections in a staggered manner during the rectification, so that Party organizations at all levels can cooperate with each other, and the higher-level Party organizations can draw a group of people to assist with the inspection.

　　Based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the experience of past rectification movements, the meetings also discussed how to ensure that the rectification and work do not interfere with each other, how to combine the rectification movement with solving the current contradictions among the people and major problems in work, and how to ensure that leading cadres can study well themselves and lead the rectification movement of the entire Party organization. Some specific measures were also proposed.

　　The participation of democratic figures and senior intellectuals in the rectification movement will be carried out entirely in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, and no coercion whatsoever is allowed. The meeting also discussed specific ways to implement this spirit.

　　The meeting decided to establish a provincial Party committee leading group for the rectification movement, headed by First Secretary Zhang Desheng, and requested that Party organizations at all levels establish leading groups and offices for the rectification movement.

    陕西省委决定立即在全省开展整风运动
    省委书记处和省委常委开紧急会议确定了初步方案
    本报西安1日电　本报记者朱波报道：中共陕西省委于4月30日接到中共中央关于整风运动的指示后，当日晚举行了书记处紧急会议，具体地研究了如何贯彻中央关于整风运动的指示。接着在5月1日上午八时又举行了省委常委紧急会议，就书记处提出的意见进行了具体的研究。确定了在全省各级党的组织开展整风运动的初步方案。
    两次会议一致认为立即开始整风是非常必要的。根据陕西省的情况来看，几年来，党内脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义有了新的滋长。最近全省三十多万党内外干部和知识分子，在讨论如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题中，暴露了很多实际工作中的问题和对人民内部矛盾的一些糊涂看法，这些问题都急待解决。
    会上，反复研究了本省在县以上各机关团体、各大型厂矿以及各大专学校等单位的党组织开展整风运动的步骤和作法。决定今年将分两批进行整风。第一批包括省委、西安市委、地委以及大型厂矿、大专学校等单位的党组织，第二批是县一级各部门的党组织。其他区、乡干部和党员将在明年分批进行整风。5月初旬起，省委负责同志将根据中央指示的精神，结合本地区的情况，分别进行开展整风运动的动员报告。从现在起，立即在机关、大型厂矿和大专学校中，扩大民主生活，听取群众对领导部门的意见，并组织能够从事体力劳动的各级领导人员参加劳动。
    整风首先从省级机关、西安市、地委级机关党组织开始，时间初步确定是四个半月。然后县委陆续开始进行整风，时间初步确定各为四个月。各级机关、团体和厂矿学校等党组织，一律先从党的领导人员开始，然后在一般工作人员中进行。具体作法是领导人员分批就地集中学习毛主席在最高国务会议和全国宣传工作会议上的两个报告、中共中央关于整风运动的指示，并参阅关于无产阶级专政的历史经验和再论无产阶级专政的历史经验等文件。每批领导人员学习的时间为两个星期。从6月中旬起，各级党组织即陆续开始进行检查。与领导人员集中学习的同时，各级党组织中一般人员也都停止理论学习，专门学习上述文件，为开展全面检查作准备。
    会议认为省委、西安市委、地委和县委在整风中，必须穿插进行，使各级党组织一方面互相配合进行检查，另一方面，上级党组织可以抽调一批人员帮助进行检查。
    会议根据中共中央的指示和过去整风的经验，还讨论了如何保证整风和工作两不误、如何把整风运动和解决当前人民内部矛盾和工作中的主要问题结合起来，以及如何保证领导干部自己能够学习好而又领导好整个党组织的整风运动等问题，并提出了一些具体措施。
    对民主人士和高级知识分子参加整风运动的问题，完全按中央指示精神进行，丝毫不能强迫。会议上还讨论了贯彻这一精神的具体办法。
    会议决定成立以第一书记张德生为首的省委领导整风运动的小组，并要求各级党组织成立整风运动的领导小组和办公室。
