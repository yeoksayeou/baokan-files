    U.S. Sixth Fleet Marines
    Once Prepared to Invade Jordan
    American Journalists Rampant in Amman

Xinhua News Agency, May 7th: According to a "The Economist" editorial on May 4th, the U.S. Sixth Fleet Marines were recently "prepared to 'airdrop' onto Jordanian territory if necessary" during the Jordanian events.

The editorial, titled "Who Won in Jordan?", states that the U.S. government now considers the events in Jordan and the acceptance of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" by the King of Saudi Arabia as "a major victory" for the United States in the Cold War in the Middle East.

The magazine points out, however, that "it is too early to say that the crisis is over: because in fact he (Hussein) has confined the powerful steam pressure of nationalism, without installing a safety valve." Although King Hussein of Jordan has temporarily "asserted his views," "Jordan's institutions or popular opinion have not changed." It says, "In Jordan's restaurants and markets, people are whispering that the King sold Jordan's new freedom for dollars."

The editorial concludes that the "solution to the Jordanian crisis is temporary," and if King Hussein and the West cannot "build a relationship on a basis more solid than suppressing all popular opposition," "then American policy will have to face the danger that the people's forces in the Arab world will invariably unite against it, just as they have consistently united against Britain in the past decade."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 7th: "Rose el Youssef" magazine reporter Mamdouh Riad, who recently returned from Amman, published a dispatch in the magazine on May 6th, exposing the arrogant behavior of American journalists in Jordan.

Mamdouh Riad wrote that among the more than two hundred foreign journalists currently in Amman, half are Americans. American journalists are, in fact, in a special position. They have been issued special passes that allow them to travel unhindered throughout Jordan at any time, even disregarding the curfew.

The press officer at the U.S. Embassy in Jordan provides information to American journalists. According to the American journalists, they knew about the Jordanian events before they happened. The press officer often instructs American journalists on what to write.

    美第六舰队陆战队
    曾经准备侵入约旦
    美国记者在安曼飞扬跋扈
    据新华社7日讯　据英国“经济学家”5月4日的社论透露，美国第六舰队的海军陆战队最近在约旦事件中，曾经“准备好在必要时‘空降’到约旦领土上”。
    这篇题为“谁在约旦获胜”的社论说，美国政府现在把约旦的事件和沙特阿拉伯国王接受“艾森豪威尔主义”联系起来，一起看做是美国在中东冷战中的“一次重大胜利”。
    这家杂志指出，但是，“说危机已过，未免太早了：因为事实上他（侯赛因）是关住了强有力的民族主义的蒸气压力，而并没有安装安全瓣。约旦国王侯赛因虽然暂时“贯彻了他的主张”，但是“约旦的机构或人民的舆论都没有改变”。它说，“在约旦的餐馆和市集上就有人在低低私语说，国王为了美元出卖了约旦的新自由”。
    社论最后说，约旦危机的“解决办法是暂时的”，如果侯赛因国王和西方不能“在比镇压一切人民的反对更为稳固的某种基础上来建立一种关系”，“那末美国的政策将不得不面临这种危险：阿拉伯世界中的人民力量将不变地联合起来反对它，犹如过去十年中，他们一贯联合起来反对英国一样。”
    据新华社开罗7日电　最近从安曼归来的“鲁兹·优素福”周刊记者马姆迪赫·里德5月6日在这家杂志发表了一篇通讯，揭露了美国记者在约旦的跋扈行为。
    马姆迪赫·里德写道，现在在安曼的二百多名外国记者中，有一半是美国人。美国记者事实上是处在特殊的地位。他们领到了一种特别通行证，不论甚么时候都可以在约旦全国各地通行无阻，甚至连宵禁也不在乎。
    美国驻约旦大使馆新闻专员向美国记者提供消息，据美国记者们说，在约旦事件发生以前他们就已经知道这件事要发生了。新闻专员经常指导美国记者应当写什么。
