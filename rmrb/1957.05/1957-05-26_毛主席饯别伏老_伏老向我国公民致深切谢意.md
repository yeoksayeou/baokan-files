Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Chairman Mao Zedong held a casual dinner at his home tonight to bid farewell to Chairman Voroshilov and other Soviet guests who are about to leave Beijing.

Present were Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and others.

This newspaper reports that Chairman Voroshilov received a large number of friendly letters and telegrams during his visit to China. On the 25th, he wrote a letter to the editorial department of the People's Daily, publicly expressing his gratitude to people from all walks of life in our country. Chairman Voroshilov's letter is as follows:

To the Editorial Department of the "People's Daily," dear comrades:

During our stay in the People's Republic of China, we received a large number of letters and telegrams from Chinese organizations, editorial departments of various newspapers and periodicals, representatives of workers, peasants, intellectuals, democratic figures, soldiers, university students, Young Pioneers, and primary and secondary school students. These letters and telegrams expressed fraternal sentiments and best wishes for the Soviet people, for a representative of the Soviet people, namely myself.

It is difficult for me to respond to these letters individually. Therefore, I specially request the "People's Daily" Editorial Department to convey my deepest gratitude, and that of the comrades who accompanied me, to those Chinese organizations, editorial departments of various newspapers and periodicals, and citizens who welcomed and blessed us. I also wish them all the best in their work for the benefit of the motherland and in consolidating the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship.

K. Voroshilov
