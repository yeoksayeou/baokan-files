    Agricultural cooperatives' management bodies should be uniformly called "Management Committees"
    In news and articles published in the People's Daily and other newspapers, the names of the management bodies of agricultural cooperatives are inconsistent—sometimes they are called "Management Committees," sometimes "Cooperatives Affairs Committees," and sometimes "Cooperatives Affairs Management Committees." This is also the case in agricultural cooperatives in various regions, where management bodies have different names. According to the model regulations for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, they should be uniformly called Management Committees. Pi Chunxie

    农业社的管理机构应统一叫做“管理委员会”
    在人民日报和别的一些报纸上发表的消息和文章中，农业社的管理机构的名称不一致——有时称“管理委员会”，有时称“社务委员会”，有时称“社务管理委员会”。在各地农业社里也是这样，管理机构有不同的名称。按照高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，应该统一称为管理委员会。　皮纯协
