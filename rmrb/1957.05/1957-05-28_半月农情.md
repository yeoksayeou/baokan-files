    Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
    Lixia (May 6th) – Xiaoman (May 21st)
    During this period, the basic situation of agricultural activities across the country is as follows: in the areas south of the Yangtze River, where rice production is the main focus, fertilization, weeding, and replanting are underway, except for Hainan Island, where harvesting has already begun. In some areas (such as Zhejiang), the temperature is still cold, and rice transplanting is still in progress. Spring-ripening crops (wheat, rapeseed, peas, etc.) have been harvested in some areas. In Zhejiang and Hunan, many farmlands have been flooded due to rain, and spring-ripening crops are sprouting and rotting, so emergency harvesting is underway. Areas north of the Yangtze River are preparing for the summer harvest and planting season.

    Hurry Up Preparations for Wheat Harvest
    Preparing for the wheat harvest is the most prominent activity currently in rural areas. Winter wheat accounts for a quarter of China's total cultivated land, so farmers in wheat-producing areas are very seriously making all preparations for the wheat harvest.
    Last year, many areas encountered continuous rain, coupled with the lack of experience in organizing production in the first year of collectivization, and the influence of some cadres' subjectivist work styles, the wheat harvest suffered undue losses. This year, having "learned a lesson from a setback," it seems that everyone, from top to bottom, is paying attention to last year's lessons and striving to avoid repeating and minimizing mistakes. For example, last year during the wheat harvest season in Shandong, it was constantly drizzling, and the agricultural cooperatives were unprepared, resulting in a large amount of wheat getting moldy; this year, some agricultural cooperatives are preparing rain and wind protection equipment as early as possible. Last year, some agricultural cooperative production teams concentrated threshing, which led to a lot of people being disorganized and delaying the process; this year, the method of using production teams as units is being adopted, which facilitates rapid threshing and avoids wind and rain. Some places in Hubei have organized specialized teams for cutting, transporting, threshing, and storing based on the summer harvest tasks, in order to avoid being busy and disorganized when the time comes. Many cadres have also improved their understanding from analyzing last year's work. The deputy head of Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, recently made a self-criticism in the newspaper, saying: "Last year, we did not consider the regional characteristics and the maturity period of wheat, and uniformly proposed to start harvesting on a certain day and at a certain time, and to end on a certain day, resulting in the loss of wheat that should not have been lost." In order to do a good job in this year's wheat harvest, the leading organs of Shaanxi Province recently specially studied the experience and lessons learned from organizing the wheat harvest last year.
    During this period, some places also raised some issues that are very worthy of attention during the wheat harvest: When is the right time to harvest? Some people believe that "harvesting at 80% maturity yields 100% of the crop," and that early harvesting can lead to early planting. In some places, wheat and cotton are intercropped, and if the wheat is not harvested early, it will affect the growth of cotton seedlings, so they advocate for early harvesting. Some people say not to harvest too early, otherwise the wheat grains will not be full, and they will shrink after drying, resulting in a large loss. Harvesting when the wheat is fully ripe, although some will be scattered, the loss is not great. When should we harvest? We should discuss this issue more with experienced farmers.

    Last Year, There Was Less Coarse Grain, Plant More This Year
    Farmers in various regions have a great interest in increasing the planting of coarse grains (sorghum, millet, beans, potatoes). Last year, less coarse grain was planted, and later, farmers felt that feed and fuel were insufficient. This year, the state only stipulates production targets for several major crops. In addition to completing the state plan, each agricultural cooperative can independently operate according to its own needs and local conditions. Therefore, this year, the planting area of certain coarse grains has increased.
    Judging from the sowing situation in the northern coarse grain producing areas, sorghum, millet, and other minor grains have increased. The planting area of potato crops has been adjusted between regions in some provinces, maintaining last year's level; Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces have slightly expanded the area. The corn planting area has been reduced in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and other provinces.
    The sowing of spring crops has ended in North China, where the season is earlier, and is nearing completion in a small number of areas. The northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are entering a tense stage.
    As of the middle of this month, Shandong Province had basically completed the sowing of sorghum, millet, spring corn, and potatoes, and is now planting sweet potatoes. Due to the wet ground and good moisture content, careful plowing and harrowing, crops are generally emerging completely. Most areas are checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, weeding, and preventing aphids.
    Among the more than 40 million mu of spring crops in Henan Province, according to statistics from the five special districts of Anyang, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Xinyang, the planned area for sorghum was 6.83 million mu, and the actual planted area was 7.4 million mu. In Kaifeng Special District, autumn crops in some areas were not harvested due to rain and flooding last year. This year, the masses planted sorghum, upland rice, and other flood-resistant crops in low-lying and flood-prone areas.
    As of the middle of this month, Hebei Province had basically completed the sowing of field crops (except sweet potatoes) in the five southern special districts. The three northern special districts of Tianjin, Tangshan, and Tongxian have completed 70%-80%, and the Zhangjiakou and Chengde special districts, where the season is later, have also generally entered a sowing climax. Sorghum, corn, millet, potatoes, oats and other crops have been planted on 40%-50% of the area. Early-sown millet and sorghum seedlings have emerged, growing two or three needle-like leaves.
    Liaoning Province has completed the sowing of millet, and corn sowing in the eastern mountainous areas has reached 80%-90%. Most grain-producing areas are generally sowing sorghum. This province has reduced the area of corn by more than 4.5 million mu this year and switched to planting sorghum and minor grains. In areas where sowing was earlier, such as Jin, Fengcheng, etc., corn and millet have emerged.
    In Jilin Province, many agricultural cooperatives have finished sowing sorghum, millet, and potato crops, and are now replanting corn. Agricultural cooperatives that sowed early have begun weeding sorghum and millet.
    At present, field sowing in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a tense stage. According to statistics on the 16th, the area already sown with oats, millet, broomcorn millet, buckwheat, etc. accounts for half of the planned sowing area.
    However, according to agricultural departments in Liaoning, Jilin and other provinces, the progress of spring plowing and sowing in many areas is slow, the quality of operations is rough, and there is a phenomenon of abandoning wasteland.

      Guanzhong Makes Every Effort to Save Cotton Seedlings
      Cotton Seedlings in Other Areas Are Good
    During this period, cotton growth in various areas is normal, and thinning, weeding, and loosening soil are underway. Only in more than 20 cotton-producing counties in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, such as Gaoling, Liquan, and Weinan, after continuous rain before the 6th, cotton seedling deaths were generally discovered once the weather cleared up. In severe areas, as much as 80% to 90% of the seedlings were missing in tens of thousands of mu of land. On the 9th, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency directive to cotton-producing areas to treat saving cotton seedlings as the central task overriding everything else, and strive to reverse the phenomenon of missing and dead seedlings in cotton fields within a week. According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily on the 14th, counties such as Gaoling have adopted methods such as checking seedlings and replanting seedlings one row at a time, and fine harrowing to loosen the soil, which has already achieved results. In addition, cotton seedlings in Xiangyang, Tianmen, Hanchuan and other places in Hubei have also suffered from diseases and pests. Farmers are now thinning seedlings, replanting seedlings, and controlling pests.

      Jute Has Been Mostly Sown
      Several Provinces Are Slow in Progress
    Jute is an important economic crop in our country and has mostly been sown at this time. It is understood that at present, except for Zhejiang and Hunan provinces, which are estimated to be able to complete the planting plan, and Fujian Province, which is close to completing the planting plan, Jiangxi Province has completed 80% of the planting plan, Jiangsu Province has completed 70%, Anhui Province has completed about 60%, and Guangdong and Shandong provinces have only completed about 50% of the planting plan. After "Xiaoman," it is no longer suitable for jute sowing, so many areas are taking measures to rush planting. However, it is estimated that completing the national sowing plan will still be difficult.

    半月农情
    立夏（5月6日）——小满（5月21日）
    这段期间，全国农事活动的基本情况是：以水稻生产为主的长江以南地区，除海南岛上已开始收割外，一般都在进行施肥、耘田、补插的工作。部分地区（如浙江）气温较冷，还在插秧。春熟作物（小麦、油菜、豌豆等），有些地区已收割完了；浙江、湖南不少农田因雨受涝，春熟作物有发芽、腐坏现象，正在抢收。长江以北地区正在准备夏收夏种。
    快收麦了，加紧准备
    收麦准备工作是农村中间当前最突出的一次活动。冬小麦占我国全部耕地四分之一，所以产麦区的农民都非常认真地在作收麦的一切准备。
    去年许多地区碰上天下雨，加上合作化头一年缺乏组织生产的经验，和一些干部的主观主义作风的影响，麦收受了不应有的损失。今年呢，“吃一堑，长一智”，看来上上下下都注意去年的教训，力求避免重犯和少犯过错。例如，去年山东麦收时节，阴雨绵绵，农业社毫无准备，霉坏了大量的麦子；今年有些农业社就及早在准备防雨防风的用具。去年一些农业社生产大队集中打场，活多人乱，拖延了时日；今年即改用以生产组为单位，这便于迅速打场，防避风雨。湖北有些地方根据夏收任务，组织了割、运、打、藏的专业组，以免临事忙乱。许多干部也从分析去年的工作中提高了认识。陕西渭南县副县长最近就在报上检查说：“去年我们不分地区特点和麦子成熟期的迟早，统统提出某日某时开始收割，某日结束，结果不该损失的麦子也受到了损失。”为了搞好今年的麦收，陕西省领导机关最近还专门研究去年组织麦收的经验教训。
    这个期间，有些地方还提出一些麦收当中很值得注意的问题：到底什么时候收割才算适时？有些人认为“八成割十成收”，而且早割便能早种，有些地方麦子和棉花间作，麦子要不早割，也会影响棉苗的生长，主张早收。有些人却说别割早了，要不麦粒不饱满，晒干后缩了，损失很大。麦熟透再割，虽然也要撒一些，但损失不大。到底该在什么时机收割，这问题应当多同老农商量办事才好。
  去年杂粮少，今年多种些
    各地农民对于增种杂粮（高粱、谷子、豆类、薯类）有很大的兴趣。去年，杂粮种少了，后来，农民感到饲料、燃料不足。今年，国家只规定几种主要作物的生产指标，在完成国家计划以外，各个农业社可以根据自己的需要，因地制宜独立经营，所以，今年某些杂粮种植面积有了增长。
    就北方杂粮产区播种情况来看，高粱、谷子和其他小杂粮都有增加。薯类作物播种面积有些省进行地区间调整，仍维持去年的水平；河北、河南、黑龙江等省略有扩大。玉米播种面积，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河南、河北、山西、山东等省都有缩减。
    春播作物的播种工作，季节较早的华北地区已经结束，小部分地区将近结束。东北各省和内蒙古自治区正进入紧张阶段。
    山东省截至这月中旬，全省高粱、谷子、春玉米和马铃薯的播种基本结束，正在栽植甘薯。由于地湿墒情好，耕耙细致，作物一般出苗齐全。大部地区已在查苗补苗和除草防蚜。
    河南省四千多万亩春播作物中，据安阳、商丘、开封、许昌、信阳五个专区统计，高粱计划面积六百八十三万亩，实际播种七百四十万亩。开封专区去年有部分地区雨涝秋作物未收，今年群众在低洼易涝地区种了高粱、旱稻等耐涝作物。
    河北省截至这月中旬，南部五个专区大田作物播种（甘薯除外）已基本结束，北部天津、唐山、通县三个专区完成了70％—80％，张家口、承德专区季节较晚，现也普遍进入播种高潮，高粱、玉米、谷子、马铃薯、莜麦等物已种完40％—50％。早种的谷子、高粱苗已出苗，长出二、三个针叶。
    辽宁省谷子播种已结束，东部山区玉米播种达80％—90％，大部粮产区正普遍播种高粱。这省今年压缩玉米四百五十多万亩，改种了高粱和小杂粮。播种较早的新金、凤城等地区，玉米、谷子已出土了。
    吉林省很多农业社高粱、谷子、薯类作物播种已经结束，正翻种玉米。播种早的农业社开始进行高粱、谷子的除草工作。
    目前内蒙古自治区大田播种已进入紧张阶段。据16日统计，全区已播种的莜麦、谷子、糜子、荞麦等，占计划播种面积的一半。
    但据辽宁、吉林等省农业部门反映：不少地区的农业社春耕播种进度迟缓，作业质量粗糙，并有撩荒地的现象。
      关中全力抢救棉苗
      其它各地棉苗良好
    这个期间各地的棉花生长正常，正在间苗、除草、松土。只有陕西关中的高陵、醴泉、渭南等二十多个产棉县，因6日以前连日阴雨，一旦放晴以后，就普遍发现棉苗死亡。严重的地方甚至几万亩地里缺苗80％至90％。9日，陕西省人民委员会曾紧急指示产棉区把抢救棉苗作为压倒一切的中心工作，争取在一周内把棉田缺苗和死苗现象扭转过来。据陕西日报14日的报道，高陵等县采取一人一行查苗补苗、细耙松土等办法，已经有了成绩。此外，湖北襄阳、天门、汉川等地的棉苗也发生病虫害。现在农民正在间苗补苗，除治虫害。
      黄麻已经大部下种
      有几个省进度迟缓
    黄麻是我国一种重要经济作物，这时已大部下种了。据了解，目前除浙江、湖南两省估计可以完成种植计划，福建省接近完成种植计划外，江西省已完成种植计划的80％，江苏省完成70％，安徽省约完成60％，广东、山东两省仅完成种植计划的50％左右。“小满”过后，即不大适宜黄麻播种了，因此，许多地区正在采取措施抢种，但是，估计完成全国播种计划仍有困难。
