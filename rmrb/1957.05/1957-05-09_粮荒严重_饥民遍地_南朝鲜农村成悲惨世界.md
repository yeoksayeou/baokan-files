Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: A Seoul dispatch: According to a report in the Seoul "Dong-A Ilbo," the number of South Korean farm households without food has reached 980,000, accounting for 43.5% of the total of 2.25 million farm households in South Korea.

According to a report in the Seoul "Kyunghyang Shinmun," 60% of farm households in Gyeongsangnam-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do provinces are without food. In Gunwi County, Gyeongsangbuk-do, 5,337 out of 9,219 farm households are without food. Farmers are eking out a living with grass roots, tree bark, and bran. Most of the households without food were forced to sell their unripe crops last year. The "Dong-A Ilbo" said that some villages and neighborhoods in Pyeongchang County, Jeongseon County, and Hongcheon County in Gangwon-do Province are completely without food.

South Korean newspapers say that the famine has turned the South Korean countryside into a tragic world, filled with famine victims whose faces are swollen. People are selling their wives and children everywhere.

According to South Korean’s Hapdong News Agency, 250,000 South Korean fishermen are also without food, subsisting on seaweed every day.

South Korean news agencies say that there is a total shortage of 6 million *seok* (one *seok* is 150 kilograms) of grain this year. The famine and households without food began in the countryside not long after the autumn harvest last year.
