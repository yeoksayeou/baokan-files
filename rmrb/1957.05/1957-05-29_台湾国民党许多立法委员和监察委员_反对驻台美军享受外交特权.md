Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 28th: Taiwan newspaper reports state that many Kuomintang legislators and censors are deeply dissatisfied with the privileges enjoyed by U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan who are treated as diplomatic personnel. During a banquet held at the "Legislative Yuan" on the 24th, legislator Xie Chengyu questioned Kuomintang "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao: Why can personnel of the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" enjoy diplomatic privileges? He said that not every American is "an angel or God!" At a banquet held by the "Control Yuan" on the 24th, censor Huang Baoshi and fourteen others put forward a motion demanding that the Kuomintang "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" quickly negotiate with the United States on the legal rights of U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan in order to "ensure the integrity of judicial power." Huang Baoshi said, "The current situation in which U.S. troops in Taiwan enjoy diplomatic treatment and are not subject to our legal trials is undoubtedly a revival of extraterritoriality." He said: "If we are to make concessions today for the sake of the U.S. dollar, this issue must be reconsidered. We cannot cede our judicial power to others!" Censor Ye Shixiu and more than ten others spoke enthusiastically at the meeting in support of Huang Baoshi's motion. Ye Shixiu pointed out that there are a large number of U.S. troops in Taiwan, and now not only personnel of the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" enjoy diplomatic privileges, but even U.S. military dependents and even servants enjoy them across the board. He said that it is precisely because U.S. troops enjoy this privilege that many cases of U.S. troops running amok have occurred. Taiwan newspapers said that all speakers unanimously believed that in order to "maintain the integrity of sovereignty," negotiations must be held with the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" as soon as possible to resolve the issue of privileges for U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan.

    反对驻台美军享受外交特权
    新华社广州28日电　台湾报纸消息，国民党许多立法委员和监察委员们对驻台湾美军享受外交人员待遇的特权深表不满。24日在“立法院”举行宴会的时候，立法委员谢澄宇质问国民党“外交部长”叶公超：为什么“美军顾问团”人员可以享受外交特权？他说，每一个美国人“并不都是天使或上帝！”监察委员黄宝实等十四人在24日举行的“监察院”宴会上提出了一项动议，要求国民党“外交部”迅速就驻台美军的法权问题与美国洽商，以“确保司法权的完整”。黄宝实说，“目前美军在台享有外交人员待遇，不受我法律审判，这无疑是治外法权的复活。”他说：“今天如果是为了美元而要我们让步的话，这问题就要重加考虑。我们不能将司法权让给人家！”监察委员叶时修等十多人在会上热烈发言，支持黄宝实的动议。叶时修指出，美军在台湾人数很多，现在不但“美军顾问团”人员享受外交人员的特权，而且连美军眷属以至佣人都一律享受。他说，正是由于让美军享受这种特权，才发生了美军横行的许多案件。台湾报纸说，所有发言的人一致认为，为了“维护主权的完整”，必须迅速与“美军顾问团”举行谈判，解决驻台美军的特权问题。
