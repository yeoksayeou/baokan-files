    A Short Account of Wang Lu	Yang Shuo
    I have a friend who is a journalist. Over the years, he has traveled all over the country and has a wealth of experience. Whenever he sees me, whom he calls "a writer who likes to comment," he also likes to talk and tell me many things. What is recorded here is a recent discussion of his rights and wrongs.
    Our country has already entered socialism, this is obvious, is there any need to ask? However, there is a type of person who doesn't stand, but rather lies down and walks into socialism. Their feet are in, their whole body is in, but their head is stuck outside the door frame, unable to enter. Take the countryside for example. In previous years, if someone's cow died, it was like a family member had died, and the whole family couldn't swallow their food. Now that collectivization has happened, the cows belong to everyone. If a cow dies, some farmers are happy—they can share the beef and should be happy!
    In February of this year, I went to a coal mine in the Northeast. If you just paid a little attention, you could pick up iron wires, spikes, screws, and other things everywhere. It was really "stepping on gold," which was heartbreaking. This, of course, was due to a few miners throwing them away casually. The culprit is always the thought: not treating public property as one's own. If it were their own, humph, they wouldn't even throw away a needle and thread.
    Once, at that coal mine, I went to interview an open-pit mine. From a distance, I saw a group of people surrounding an electric drill, spinning around. Smoke was billowing around the electric drill, and flames were shooting out of the openings on both sides of the electric drill. Some people were throwing sand on it in a panic, but they couldn't suppress the fire. I ran down, and just happened to meet several other workers who had just arrived, looking like they had just gotten off work and were going home.
    The leading worker was not tall, about twenty years old. As soon as he ran up, he panted and shouted, "How did it catch fire? It must be electrical."
    A worker behind him asked anxiously, "What should we do?"
    The young worker said, "What should we do? Take off your clothes!"
    Someone said, "Won't the clothes be burned?"
    The young worker said, "Don't worry about that." He took off his cotton jacket and jumped onto the electric drill.
    Someone shouted, "Don't go up, you'll be burned to death!"
    The young worker ignored him, braving the smoke and fire to jump up. Immediately after, two more workers jumped up. Flames swirled around their heads, and the workers turned their faces to avoid the fire, frantically beating at it with their cotton jackets, and smothering the fire with them.
    The young worker shouted from above, "Get water!"
    Water was brought, and the people below splashed it on. With everyone working together, they finally extinguished the fire. It was February, originally very cold. After putting out the fire, the young worker was wearing only a single layer of clothing, and his whole body was soaked with sweat. He only said, "It's time to go home for dinner," put on his burned jacket, and left.
    You see, this is another kind of person, completely entering socialism. At that time, I inquired and found out that this young man was called Wang Lu, and he was the driver of the No. 42 electric drill.
    You must be asking: what kind of person is this exactly? This person is indeed interesting. At first glance, Wang Lu's face is a little pale, making him seem rather weak. He is also a bit shy and doesn't talk much. As soon as you get in touch with him, you will immediately feel a kind of energy in him. You can't say what kind of energy it is, but it's hot, as if he will rush out at any time. If you say a few bad things about the mine in front of him, he won't be polite, and he will definitely argue with you. When he talks about the mine, it's like talking about a beloved beauty: "Oh my! You haven't seen that open-pit mine. The coal is so black and shiny, it's radiant. If you took a few bites, it would be crispy and delicious."
    As for that electric drill, it is even more like the apple of his eye. In his heart, it is not a machine, but a living person with life and emotion. He is often heard clicking his tongue and saying, "Look at this old fellow, so bright and shiny, how mighty! When it starts working, even the gods can't compete with it." When he goes home to sleep at night, he can't put it down, and sometimes he suddenly gets up in the middle of the night to listen. He listens to the sound of the electric drill like listening to people talking. A cough, a syllable, can tell him that it is his relative, and he can also hear how his relative is feeling. If the sound is good, he knows that the electric drill is not sick, and he can sleep peacefully. Sometimes he simply doesn't go home, but stays with the electric drill, which makes his wife complain that he doesn't understand love.
    His companions joke and say, "You must have fallen in love with this old fellow."
    Wang Lu's feelings for the electric drill are strong. He always thinks of the electric drill first, and doesn't think much about himself. This open-pit mine was developed by the Japanese in the early years, and they dug many inclined shafts. Later, the entrances were blocked, and you can't see them from the surface. If the electric drill passes over them, the soil will collapse, the machine will sink, and it will take a few weeks to get it out, which will delay a lot of production. On two occasions, Wang Lu was driving the electric drill to mine coal, and he felt that the soil under the wheels was loose, and he suspected: could there be an "old pit"? He took a few steps and pressed the ground in front with the bucket head of the electric drill. Suddenly, with a bang, the soil pressed down, and an "old pit" was revealed. Wang Lu is actually an impatient person, so why is he so careful? This is not surprising. Anyone is always extra sensitive to the safety of the person they love.
    However, one night, he almost lost his life and machine.
    That night, Wang Lu and a driver named Yang Changsheng were on the second half of the night shift. It was winter, and the night was terribly cold. Before dawn, Wang Lu handed over the machine to Yang Changsheng and sat behind the driver's room, took off his gloves and just wanted to warm himself by the fire when he suddenly smelled a gunpowder smell. Wang Lu's heart skipped a beat, and he thought: according to the regulations, it is not allowed to blast rocks at night, and I didn't hear the sound of blasting, so where did the gunpowder smell come from? While thinking, he returned to the driver's room. The headlight of the electric drill was on. Wang Lu looked out the window from behind Yang Changsheng, and a white rope appeared in the light, as thick as a match head, what else could it be but the fuse of an explosive?
    At this time, Yang Changsheng had already dug a spoonful of explosives, thinking it was coal, and threw it on the car, and was about to dig a second spoonful. Wang Lu shouted loudly, "Don't dig! There are explosives!"
    Yang Changsheng was so surprised that he turned the bucket head to the side. The two jumped down and saw a large pile of explosives in front of them. They pulled down with their hands and pulled out two detonators.
    Wang Lu stuck out his tongue and said, "That was close! If the bucket head had hit the detonator, the drill would have been blown to pieces, and our little lives would have been over!"
    However, the origin of this pile of explosives must be investigated clearly. Wang Lu couldn't suppress his anger and immediately took the detonators to question the safety squad leader.
    The squad leader said, "Maybe they are duds?"
    Wang Lu said, "Duds?" He immediately forced the squad leader to take the detonators out and test them with electricity, and they exploded.
    Wang Lu said angrily, "Why are explosives being dropped and detonated casually when blasting rocks? An electric drill costs 600,000 yuan. If it is blown up, what a great loss to the country! If people die, it is even more priceless. Responsibility must be thoroughly investigated, and public property cannot be treated as a child's play."
    Whether it is to superiors or subordinates, if he finds something wrong, he is always so impartial and criticizes them face to face. Some people blame him for his bad temper. In fact, it is not a matter of temper. A person who loves public affairs will naturally be aroused to oppose any behavior that damages the cause.
    When that journalist friend talked about this, I interjected and asked, "Are you talking about Wang Lu from the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine?"
    The reporter was stunned for a moment, and asked back, "That's right, do you know him?"
    Of course I know him. I just talked with Wang Lu for most of yesterday. He came to Beijing to attend the National Congress of the Communist Youth League. When talking about the mine and his electric drill, this young man lowered his head and said shyly, "The day I left the mine, I really missed it, and I didn't sleep well all night. I thought: what does my electric drill look like, how does it move, and what sound does it make, my heart trembles. Last night I dreamed that I was on the electric drill."
    Due to my professional habits, I can't help but "comment." So I asked the journalist, "Can you analyze why he loves the mine so much?"
    The reporter smiled and said, "What's so difficult to analyze? Think about it, he went to the coal mine in Fuxin at the age of eleven. His father died early, his mother died too, and he was all alone, running barefoot in the snowdrifts in the cold winter. He didn't die, wasn't that a life he picked up? He has lived in the mine for fourteen years, and now he has started a family, established a career, and has what he has today. His pain, his happiness, his life are all combined with the mine, how can you teach him not to love it?"
    People who don't understand the hardship of starting a business should learn from people like Wang Lu how to love our cause!

    王禄小记	杨朔
    我有位朋友，是个记者，几年来走南闯北的，阅历很深，每逢见到我这个他称做“喜欢评头品足的文人”，也爱说长论短，告诉我许多事情。这里记的就是他新近谈的一番是非。
    我们的国家已经走进社会主义了，这是明明白白的事，还用问么？可是，就有一类人，不是站着，倒是躺着往社会主义里走。脚进去了，全身都进去了，偏偏脑袋别在门框子外边，进不去。拿农村来说吧，往常年，要是谁家死头牛，真像死了亲人一样，一家人饭都咽不下去。于今合作化了，牛归大家所有，死了牛，有的农民倒会高兴——能分到牛肉吃，好像也该高兴！
    今年2月，我到东北一个煤矿去，只要眼睛稍微留神些，到处可以捡到铁丝、道钉、螺丝帽一类东西。真是“脚下踩黄金”，叫人心痛。这自然是少数矿工随手丢的。作怪的总是思想：不把公家东西当成自家东西一样看待。要是自家的，哼，连点针头线脑也舍不得扔。
    有一回，就是在那个煤矿上，我到一所露天矿去采访，老远望见一堆人围着台电镐乱转转。电镐周围烟腾腾的，火苗顺着电镐两边的门口往外窜。有人手忙脚乱地往上撂沙子，也压不住火。我跑下去，迎面正好有另外几个工人刚刚跑到，看样子，都是才下班要回家的。
    领头的工人身材不高，约摸二十几岁，一跑到跟前便喘着嚷：“怎么会起火的？准是电火。”
    后边一个工人急的问：“咋办？”
    那个青年工人说：“咋办？脱衣服！”
    有人说：“不把衣服烧坏了？”
    青年工人说：“管那个呢。”脱下棉袄便往电镐上跳。
    不知谁喊：“别上去，看烧死你！”
    青年工人理也不理，冒着烟火跳上去，紧跟着又有两个工人也跳上去。火苗顺着他们的头顶卷来卷去，几个工人侧着脸避开火，拿棉袄乱扑打，又用袄往火上捂。
    那个青年工人又在上边喊：“弄水来！”
    水弄来，下边的人往上泼，七手八脚总算把火救灭。2月天，本来冷的很，那个青年工人救完火下来，身上穿着单衣，浑身上下都教汗湿透了。只说了句：“该回家吃饭啦。”披上烧糊的棉袄走了。
    你看，这又是一类人，彻头彻尾走进社会主义来。当时我一打听，知道这个青年叫王禄，是四十二号电镐的司机。
    你一定要问：这到底是怎样个人物？这个人物也确实有意思。乍一看，王禄的脸有点苍白，显得怪孱弱的。人也有点羞涩，不大言语。只要你一接触他，立刻会觉得他身上有股劲，说不出是股什么劲，反正热烫烫的，好像随时都会一头冲出去。不信你当着他的面说矿山几句坏话，他才不留情面呢，不顶你几句才怪。听他谈起矿山，就像谈起心爱的美人儿似的：“唉呀呀！你没见那露天大矿啊，煤黑亮黑亮的，直放光，要是啃它几口，准是又酥又脆。”
    至于那台电镐，更是他心尖上的肉。这不是机器，在他心上，这是个有生命有感情的活人。时常听见他啧啧着舌头说：“瞧这老家伙，溜明崭亮，多威武！干起活来，饶你是神仙也赛不过他。”黑夜回家睡觉，也放不下心，有时睡到半夜忽然会爬起来听。他听电镐的声音，就像听人说话一样，一声咳嗽，一个字音，就能听出那是自己的亲人，还能听出亲人的心情怎样。声音好，知道电镐没病，他才能安心睡觉。有时干脆不回家，守着电镐睡，惹得妻子抱怨他不懂情意。
    伙伴们耍笑他说：“你敢情是爱上这个老家伙了。”
    王禄对电镐的感情是浓，凡事总是先想到电镐，不大想到自己。这个露天矿早年日本人便开发过，挖了许多斜井，后来井口又堵住，表面看不出，要是电镐从上边过，土一压塌，机器陷下去，几个星期才能弄上来，不知要耽误多少生产。有那么两次，王禄开着电镐采煤，觉得轮子底下的土发松，好生疑心：是不是有“老塘”啊？他就走几步，用电镐的杓子头按一按前面的地皮。忽然轰隆一声，土按下去，果然露出个“老塘”。王禄实际是个急性子人，为什么会这样细心？这也不怪。对于自己心爱的人的安全，任何人总是格外敏感的。
    不过有一晚上，还是差点儿连人带机器都葬送了。
    那一晚上，王禄和一个叫杨长生的司机轮的是后半夜班。正是冬天，黑夜冷的要命，天亮以前，王禄把机器交给杨长生操纵，自己坐到司机室后边，脱下手套刚想烤火，忽然闻到一股火药味。王禄的心一动，寻思说：照规章，夜间不许放炮炸岩石，又没听见炮响，那儿来的炸药味呢？一边想一边又回到司机室去。电镐的头灯正亮着。王禄从杨长生身后往窗户外一望，灯光里显出一条发白的绳子，有火柴头粗，不是炸药的火线是什么？
    这时杨长生已经挖了一杓炸药，还当是煤，撂到车上，又要去挖第二杓，王禄大声喊：“别挖！有炸药！”
    杨长生惊的把杓子头一转，转到旁边去。两人跳下去一看，前面就是一大堆炸药，用手往下一扒拉，扒拉出两个雷管来。
    王禄一伸舌头说：“好险啊！这要是杓子头一碰上雷管，镐炸碎了，咱俩的小命也完了！”
    只是这堆炸药是怎么个来历，一定要追查清楚。王禄压不住火，立时拿着雷管去质问安全班长。
    班长说：“也许是臭的吧？”
    王禄说：“臭的？”当场逼着班长把雷管拿出去，通上电一试，响了。
    王禄怒气冲冲说：“为什么炸岩石随便丢炮拉炮？一台电镐六十万元，万一炸坏了，国家的损失多大！人死了，更是没有价钱。得好好追究责任，不能拿着公家财产当儿戏。”
    不管对上边，还是对下边，发现错处，他总是这样铁面无私，当面批评。有人怪他脾气不好。其实不是脾气问题。一个热爱公家事业的人，对于任何损害事业的行为，自然会激起他的反对。
    那位记者朋友谈到这儿，我插嘴问：“你说的是不是阜新海州露天矿的那个王禄？”
    记者楞了楞，反问道：“不错啊，你认识他么？”
    当然认识。我昨天刚和王禄谈了大半天，他是到北京来参加青年团全国代表大会的。谈起矿山，谈到他的电镐，这个年青人低着头，还羞搭搭地说：“乍离开矿山那天，我真想啊，一宿都没睡好。一寻思：我的电镐什么样，怎么动法，叫的又是什么声音，我的心就发颤。昨天晚上做梦，还梦见在电镐上呢。”
    由于我的职业性的习惯，我不能不“评头品足”一番。于是我问那位记者道：“你分析分析，为什么他对矿山会那么爱？”
    记者笑笑说：“这有什么难分析的？你想想，他十一岁到阜新下煤坑，父亲早死了，母亲又死了，孤孤零零一个人，大冬天光着脚鸭子在雪窝里跑，没死还不是捡的一条命。一直在矿山上住了十四年，于今成了家，立了业，有了今天。他的痛苦，他的幸福，他的生命，都跟矿山结合到一起，你怎么能教他不爱？”
    不懂得创业艰难的人，应该从王禄这类人身上，学着怎样去爱我们的事业吧！
