Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - According to Professor S. Braines, Soviet scientist, people suffering from premature aging and declining sexual function can be treated and restored through abundant sleep.

Braines published an article in a Moscow newspaper on May 18th, stating that personal hygiene and regular diet are important for preventing premature aging, but he emphasized that people have underestimated the importance of sleep when studying this aspect so far. He cited the example that animals can withstand hunger for up to thirty days, but lack of sleep can kill them within ten days.

Braines believes that human aging is caused by excessive tension of the main nerve functions in the cerebral cortex. Soviet scientists have used methods to over-stimulate the nervous systems of young mice and monkeys, causing them to lose their libido, lose hair, and experience muscle atrophy. Later, artificial sleep therapy was used to eliminate these premature aging phenomena.

Professor Braines performed three months of artificial sleep therapy on a fifteen-year-old dog that was aging badly, and restored it to health. Now the dog is twenty-one years old, its reaction to the environment and its sexual function have gradually recovered and remained so until now.

Braines said he is convinced that this treatment will help humans.

Braines' article is part of the research work on prolonging life that is currently being encouraged in the Soviet Union. An anti-aging research institute has been established in Moscow.

### 苏联科学家发现  大量睡眠能治疗未老先衰

    苏联科学家发现
    大量睡眠能治疗未老先衰
    新华社莫斯科20日电　据苏联科学家斯·布莱恩斯教授最近说，未老先衰和性机能衰退的人通过大量的睡眠可以得到治疗和恢复。
    布莱恩斯5月18日在莫斯科一家报纸上发表文章说，个人卫生和有规律的饮食对防止未老先衰是重要的，但是他强调说人们到现在为止在研究这方面问题时对睡眠的重要性是估计不足的。他举例说，动物可以忍受饥饿多至三十天，但是缺少睡眠却能使它们在十天内死亡。
    布莱恩斯认为，人的衰老是由于大脑皮质中主要神经机能过度紧张而造成的。苏联科学家们曾经通过使神经系统过分紧张的办法使得年轻的老鼠和猴子性欲消失，毛发脱落，肌肉衰退。后来又用人工睡眠疗法使这些先衰的现象消失。
    布莱恩斯教授曾经对一只已经活了十五年、衰老不堪的狗进行了三个月的人工睡眠疗法之后，使它恢复了健康。现在这只狗已经活了二十一年，它对环境的反应，它的性机能逐渐恢复并且一直保持到现在。
    布莱恩斯说，他深信这种治疗办法将有助于人类。
    布莱恩斯的文章是苏联目前正在鼓励进行的延年益寿的研究工作中的一部分。莫斯科已经建立了一个防老延年的研究院。
