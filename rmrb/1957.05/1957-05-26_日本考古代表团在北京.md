    Japanese Archaeological Delegation in Beijing

    This newspaper reports that the Japanese Archaeological Delegation, a group of ten individuals, has been visiting China for over a month. The delegation was invited by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is led by Dr. Harada Yoshito, a Japanese archaeological authority in his twilight years. Dr. Harada lectured in China more than twenty years ago. Delegation members Sugimura Yuzo, Komai Kazuchika, Mizuno Seiichi, and Sekino Takeshi all studied in Beijing. Only Sugihara Sosuke, Higuchi Takayasu, and Okazaki Takashi are visiting China for the first time.

    Since arriving in China, the delegation has visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Qufu, Xi'an, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Dunhuang, Chengdu, and other places. They have also engaged in a series of academic activities in Beijing.

    During their time in Beijing, the delegation visited the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Paleozoological Research Laboratory, the Museum of History, and the Palace Museum multiple times. They also visited Peking University, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and Zhoukoudian. Three symposiums were held at the Department of History of Peking University, the Institute of Archaeology, and the Academy of Sciences. Dr. Harada and several other scholars also gave several academic reports.

    On May 6th, Dr. Harada delivered a lecture at Peking University's history department on "The Relationship Between Chinese and Japanese Culture from Archaeological Data," the same topic he lectured on at Peking University twenty-seven years ago. He stated that Chinese and Japanese cultures had a very close relationship in ancient times. As early as the Warring States period, many Chinese people migrated to Korea, and Chinese culture was brought to Korea along with them. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty established the Four Commanderies of Lelang, and Chinese culture began to spread from Korea to Japan.

    Speaking of Chinese and Japanese culture around the 3rd century AD, Dr. Harada used many vivid historical examples. He said that according to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the Emperor of Wei sent one hundred bronze mirrors to the Queen of Yamatai in Japan. Many such mirrors have been unearthed in Japan, with inscriptions about the Wei and Wu kingdoms of the Three Kingdoms period.

    He then talked about Chinese and Japanese culture during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. He said that at this time, there was an emperor in Japan called Emperor Yūryaku, who often sent envoys to China, bringing Chinese textile and sewing techniques to Japan. Some sewing workers also went to Japan. Later, great changes took place in Japanese clothing, food, housing, and transportation. From then on, Japanese pavilions were also built.

    This archaeologist is most interested in Chinese culture of the Tang Dynasty. He himself specializes in the culture of the Nara period in Japan (which is equivalent to the Tang Dynasty in China). Therefore, this section was particularly vivid. He said that Chinese culture of the Tang Dynasty can be said to be world culture because at that time, China absorbed the cultures of many countries. Japanese culture at this time was not much different from Chinese culture. Heijo-kyo in Japan was like a small Chang'an. Many cultural relics unearthed in Japan can often be found recorded in ancient Chinese books.

    At the end of the lecture, Dr. Harada introduced the development of archaeology in Japan and praised the development of archaeology in China in recent years. Dr. Harada's lecture attracted more than 1,500 listeners.

    At the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Komai gave a lecture on "On Megalithic Culture," Sugihara gave a lecture on "Recent Problems in the Study of Japanese Stone Age Culture," Higuchi gave a lecture on "The Influence of Chinese Culture on the Kofun Period in Japan," and Okazaki introduced his archaeological travels in the Near East and his archaeological work on Tsushima. These lectures further elaborated on the relationship between Chinese and Japanese cultures.

    On the morning of the 10th, the delegation held a four-hour symposium with more than 30 historians and archaeologists in Beijing, including Jian Bozan and Xia Nai.

    Scholars such as Komai, Higuchi, and Okazaki also held discussions with young Chinese archaeologists. At the meeting, Okazaki read a letter from the Japan Young Archaeologists Association to young Chinese archaeologists, hoping to establish contact with Chinese archaeologists.

    On the evening of the 20th, Dr. Harada and five others returned to Beijing after visiting the Northwest, and once again visited various research institutions, museums, and universities. On the evening of the 22nd, Sugihara lectured at Peking University on "The Origin of Japanese Agricultural Culture." On the 24th, Mizuno lectured at the Palace Museum on "The Origin of the Yungang Grottoes." After ending their activities in Beijing, Dr. Harada and the other five members of the delegation will leave Beijing on the 26th to meet Komai and the other five in Wuhan to go to Changsha and Guangzhou, and then return to their country.

### 日本考古代表团在北京

    日本考古代表团在北京
    本报讯　日本考古代表团一行十人在我国访问，已经一个多月了。代表团是应中国科学院郭沫若院长的邀请，来我国访问的，由年逾古稀的日本考古学权威原田淑人博士率领。原田博士在二十多年前曾到中国讲学过，代表团团员杉村勇造、驹井和爱、水野清一、关野雄诸学者都曾在北京留学。只有杉原庄介、樋口隆康和冈琦敬是第一次到中国来。
    代表团到我国后，除在上海、杭州、南京、济南、曲阜、西安、洛阳、郑州、敦煌、成都等地参观外，并在北京进行了一系列的学术活动。
    在北京期间，代表团多次参观了中国科学院考古研究所、古脊椎动物研究室、历史博物馆和故宫博物院。参观了北京大学、中央民族学院和周口店。并在北大历史系、考古研究所和科学院举行了三次座谈会。原田团长和其他几位学者，还作了多次的学术报告。
    5月6日，原田博士在北京大学举办的历史讲座上作了“从考古资料看中日文化关系”的讲演，这是他二十七年以前在北京大学讲学的题目。他说，中日两国的文化在古代就有着非常亲密的关系。远在战国时代，就有很多中国人迁移到朝鲜，中国的文化也就随着带到了朝鲜。汉武帝设乐浪四郡，中国文化开始从朝鲜传到日本。
    讲到公元三世纪左右的中日文化，原田博士用了许多生动的史例。他说，据三国的魏志记载，魏天子曾经送给日本倭国女王一百个铜镜。现在在日本出土的这种镜子很多，上面还有关于三国魏、吴的记载。
    接着他讲到南北朝时候的中日文化。他说，这时，日本有一个天皇叫雄略天皇，常常派使者到中国来，把中国的纺织、缝衣的技术带到了日本，有些缝衣工人也随着到了日本。以后使得日本的衣食住都发生了很大的变化，从此日本的楼阁也建筑起来了。
    这位考古家最有兴趣的还是中国唐代的文化。他本人就是专研究日本奈良朝（就相当于我国的唐代）文化的。因此，这一段讲的特别生动。他说，中国唐代的文化可以说是世界文化，因为，当时，中国吸收了许多国家的文化。日本这时的文化和中国的文化就没有什么差别，日本的平城京就好像一个小长安。日本的许多出土文物，往往在中国的古书里找到记载。
    在讲演将结束的时候，原田博士介绍了日本考古学发展的情况，并赞扬近几年中国考古事业的发展。原田博士的讲演吸引了一千五百多个听众。
    在中国科学院，驹井作了“关于巨石文化”的讲演，杉原作了“日本石器文化研究最近的问题”的讲演，樋口作了“日本古坟时代所受中国文化的影响”的讲演，冈琦介绍了他在近东考古旅行和在对马进行考古工作的情况。这些讲演更细致地阐述了中日文化的关系。
    10日上午，代表团同在京的历史考古学家翦伯赞、夏鼐等三十多人进行了四个小时的座谈。
    驹井、樋口、冈琦等学者还和我国青年考古学者进行座谈。冈琦在会上宣读了日本青年考古学协议会给中国青年考古学者的一封信，希望能够同中国考古学者建立联系。
    20日晚，原田团长等五人从西北参观后回到北京，再次参观各研究机关、博物馆和大学。22日晚杉原在北京大学讲演“日本农业文化的起源”。24日水野在故宫博物院作了“云岗石窟源流”的讲演。团长原田等五人结束在北京的活动后，将于26日离京，与驹井等五人在武汉会合去长沙、广州，然后归国。
