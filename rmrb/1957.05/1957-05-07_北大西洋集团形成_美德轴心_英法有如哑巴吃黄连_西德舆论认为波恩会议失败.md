    North Atlantic Group Forms "Axis of Virtue"
    Britain and France Suffer in Silence
    West German Public Opinion Believes Bonn Meeting Failed
    This newspaper reports A Reuters dispatch from Bonn reveals that the British are uneasy about the increasingly dictatorial behavior of the United States in the Western bloc. The news was sent from Bonn a few days ago after a two-day meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Bonn, West Germany.
    The Reuters report, citing the "Observer," pointed out that during the meeting, there was no sign that the United States, Britain, and France would resume the practice of consulting each other before holding important international conferences, as they had done before the Suez crisis. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau were both in subordinate positions this time.
    The report added: French and British officials remained silent when asked if they would resume this three-way consultation in the future. The informal three-way leadership that the North Atlantic Group had before the Suez crisis is now a thing of the past. This alliance has shifted from a three-way leadership of Britain, the United States, and France to a "German-American axis."
    The pro-American newspaper "Der Tagesspiegel" in West Berlin also said on the 3rd that the Bonn meeting showed from the beginning "a West German-American united front against Britain."
    This newspaper reports According to Western news agencies, Bonn regards the mention of German reunification in the North Atlantic Group Council's communiqué as a diplomatic victory for Dulles and Adenauer. However, West German public opinion considers the meeting a failure.
    On May 3rd, a Social Democratic Party spokesman criticized the Council meeting for not resolving "any issues of major concern to the German people" and for not taking into account the unease of West German public opinion caused by nuclear weapons testing and atomic armament plans.
    Several major West German newspapers also criticized the Council on the 4th for not putting forward any proposals on the restoration of German unity. The "Neue Rhein Zeitung" said: "No representative put forward any concrete proposals for new efforts to restore German unity. No plans were discussed at the meeting." The "Abendpost" also said that the representatives "did not formulate or even discuss" any plans for German unification, but "merely paid lip service to how serious and valuable the cause of German unification is."
    Xinhua News Agency, May 6th, Bonn dispatch: After the North Atlantic Group Council meeting, representatives of the group's fifteen member states met again on the 4th to discuss new secret plans regarding atomic nuclear weapons and missiles. According to Western news agencies, the new plan stipulates that in peacetime, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group's "Allied Forces" (currently the American officer Norstad) will control these weapons, while each member state will be able to obtain nuclear weapons and missiles immediately when necessary.
    According to reports, this plan has two purposes: on the one hand, to prevent the armies of the United States' North Atlantic Group allies from being equipped with real nuclear weapons in peacetime, because the issue of equipping nuclear weapons has aroused fierce opposition in these countries; on the other hand, it can also avoid conflicting with American laws prohibiting the secret transfer of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons to foreign countries.

### 北大西洋集团形成“美德轴心”  英法有如哑巴吃黄连  西德舆论认为波恩会议失败

    北大西洋集团形成“美德轴心”
    英法有如哑巴吃黄连
    西德舆论认为波恩会议失败
    本报讯　前几天北大西洋公约组织理事会在西德波恩举行了两天的会议。会后路透社从波恩发出的一条消息透露出英国人对于美国在西方集团中日益独断专行的情形感到不安。
    路透社的消息引“观察家”的意见指出，在会议期间，毫无迹象表示美、英、法三国将恢复苏伊士事件以前的那种在重要的国际会议举行前三国先进行会商的做法。英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺这次都处在次要的地位。
    消息还说：法国和英国官员在被问到以后是否将恢复这种三国会商的做法时都默然无言。北大西洋集团在苏伊士危机以前所有的那种非正式的三国领导实际上已是明日黄花了。这个联盟已从英美法三国领导转变为“德—美轴心”。
    西柏林的亲美报纸“每日镜报”3日也说，波恩会议从一开始就表现了“一种西德—美国联合阵线来对付英国”。
    本报讯　据西方通讯社说，波恩方面把北大西洋集团理事会公报上提到德国统一的一点看作是杜勒斯及阿登纳的外交胜利。但是西德公众舆论却认为会议是个失败。
    5月3日，社会民主党发言人抨击理事会会议并未解决“对德国人民有重大关系的任何问题”，也没有考虑到西德舆论由于核武器试验和原子军备计划而引起的不安。
    西德几家重要报纸也在4日指责理事会没有提出关于恢复德国统一的任何建议。“新莱茵报”说：“没有任何一个代表提出关于使德国恢复统一的新努力的具体建议。会上也没有讨论过任何计划”。“午报”也说：代表们“没有拟订甚至没有讨论”任何有关德国统一的计划，而“仅仅空谈德国统一的事业如何严重和如何宝贵”。
    新华社6日讯　波恩消息：北大西洋集团理事会会议结束后，这个集团十五个成员国的代表在4日再度集会，讨论了关于原子核武器和导弹的新的秘密计划。据西方通讯社报道，新计划规定：在和平时期由北大西洋集团的“盟军”最高统帅（现在是美国军官诺斯塔德）掌握这类武器，而各成员国则在必要时马上就能得到核武器和导弹。
    据报道，这个计划有两个目的：一方面使美国的北大西洋集团盟国的军队在和平时期不必配备真的核武器，因为关于装备核武器的问题已经在这些国家里引起了激烈的反对；另一方面，也能避免同关于禁止把核武器和核武器秘密交给外国的美国法律相抵触。
