    Our Agricultural Scientists' Honor
    Yu Dafu and Others Elected Corresponding Members of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) Our country's outstanding plant pathologist Yu Dafu, plant physiologist Luo Zonglu, and wheat breeder Jin Shanbao were elected as corresponding members of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences at a meeting of the academy on May 4th. The academy has a total of one hundred and fifty academicians and corresponding members.
    Yu Dafu has been engaged in theoretical research on plant pathology for several years, and has also conducted many research projects on the prevention and control of crop diseases in conjunction with production. He is currently conducting research on the red leaf disease of millet, and is also a professor in the Department of Plant Protection at Beijing Agricultural University. Luo Zonglu has been engaged in theoretical research on plant hydro-physiology for several years. This research is of great significance for plant drought resistance and flood resistance. He is the director of the Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Jin Shanbao's wheat breeding research has always been carried out in conjunction with practical applications. The "Nanda 2419" superior wheat variety he selected has been adopted in more than 30 million mu of farmland in the Yangtze River Basin and has generally achieved increased production. He is currently working on two projects, "Classification of Chinese Wheat" and "Research on Wheat Ecological Types." He also serves as the president of Nanjing Agricultural College and the vice president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
    Prior to this, our country's rice scientist Ding Ying and mycologist Dai Fanglan had already been elected as corresponding members of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the German Democratic Republic. Ding Ying is the president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Dai Fanglan is the director of the Institute of Mycology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    All five of them are members of the Department of Biology and Geosciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
