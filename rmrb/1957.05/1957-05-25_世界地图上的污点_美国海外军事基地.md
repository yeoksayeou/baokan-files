    Stains on the World Map
    U.S. Overseas Military Bases
    Yuan Wen
    In the U.S. imperialists' global aggression plan, the construction of overseas military bases occupies an important position. According to official U.S. statistics, the United States has more than 120 major air force bases and more than 60 naval bases outside its homeland and on the territory of other countries (not including ground forces and smaller auxiliary facilities), and plans to increase the number of air force bases to 156 by 1959. According to figures released by the U.S. government, U.S. investment in the construction of overseas military bases (costs for which treaties have been signed and obligations undertaken) amounted to more than $6.33 billion in the seven fiscal years from 1951 to 1957, not including the large amount of secret expenses. In addition, the United States has also forced member states of various aggressive blocs to build a large number of military bases (for example, the North Atlantic Group has built 150 airports) for U.S. use.

    Spearhead Aimed at the Socialist Camp
    One of the purposes of the United States in building military bases around the world is to use military force to encircle and threaten the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Important U.S. military and political figures have never concealed this. For many years, U.S. officials have repeatedly clamored for the establishment of a military encirclement of the socialist camp; U.S. bourgeois newspapers have often discussed various methods of attacking socialist countries' cities from these bases.

    In the actual deployment of the U.S. military base network, readers can see from the map attached to this article: starting from the Arctic, extending to the eastern and western hemispheres respectively, forming two crescent-shaped arcs surrounding the socialist camp. So far, according to official U.S. materials, the United States has built more than 40 major air force bases and more than 30 naval bases (including larger naval auxiliary bases) on the eastern hemisphere arc; and nearly 80 major air force bases and nearly 30 naval bases (also including larger naval auxiliary bases) on the western hemisphere arc. In addition, the United States can also use the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Treaty, the U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Treaty, the Baghdad Pact, and various bilateral military agreements to use some military bases of other countries.

        Distribution of the Base Network
    The base groups in various regions on these two military arcs of the United States have their own strategic tasks.

    Alaska and Aleutian Islands Base Group - Controls the Bering Strait and the North Pacific, threatening the industrial center of Soviet Siberia.

    Hawaii Islands and East Pacific Zone Base Group - The gateway for the United States to the Far East, and also the supply center for the U.S. military in the Far East, serving as a ladder for aggression against the Far East.

    Western Pacific Zone Base Group - With Guam as the military center and logistics base, Japan and the Philippines as the command and supply centers on the north and south wings, and South Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan as the front-line bases, threatening the socialist camp from the east, first of all our country and other Asian People's Democratic countries.

    Greenland Zone Base Group - Threatens the industrial center of the European part of the Soviet Union from the north.

    Atlantic Islands Base Group - Serving as a mid-way supply and refueling base to support the U.S. Air Force stationed in Europe and North Africa.

    European Zone Base Group - This is the main forward base network for attacking the socialist camp from the European continent, first of all the Eastern European People's Democratic countries and the European part of the Soviet Union.

    North Africa and Middle East Zone Base Group - Threatens the Central Asian part of the Soviet Union and the Southern European People's Democratic countries.

    In the above deployment, special mention should be made of the U.S. bases in Taiwan. These bases are military strongholds where the United States occupies our territory of Taiwan and directly threatens our country's security.

      Another More Practical Purpose
    However, threatening the socialist camp is by no means the sole purpose of the U.S. overseas base group, as the U.S. officials have been trying to make people believe. The powerful strength of the socialist camp has taught the United States and its followers many lessons, making them have to consider what fate they will encounter if they really use these bases to launch an attack on socialist countries. Precisely because of this, while U.S. officials are vigorously promoting the so-called "collective security" and "common defense," they actually harbor another unannounced and more practical purpose - to establish control over other countries and suppress the people of all countries, especially the national independence movements of the people of Asia and Africa.

    A series of base groups on the eastern hemisphere arc, especially in the Pacific region, also threaten the security of newly independent countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Cambodia, while placing countries such as Japan and the Philippines under U.S. military control.

    In the Western Hemisphere, the United States is also attempting to use its series of base groups in Northern and Western Europe to strengthen its control over Canada and European "allies." The United States is currently actively planning to set up missile bases in many European countries, which is also related to this purpose. The base groups in Southern Europe are tools for the United States to control the Mediterranean and squeeze out the influence of Britain and France. For example, an important purpose of the United States in establishing bases in Spain and the Mediterranean is to seize the control of the Mediterranean, which has always been in the hands of Britain. The current main purpose of the United States in actively establishing bases in North Africa and the Middle East is to facilitate the suppression of the surging national independence movements in this region, while squeezing out the old colonial forces such as Britain and France.

    In addition to the eastern hemisphere base arc and the western hemisphere base arc introduced earlier, the United States has also established
  a huge military base network in the Caribbean region (currently, two air force bases and seven naval bases have been built). The main role of these bases is to ensure U.S. political control and economic plunder of Central and South American countries.

        Goals for Further Expansion
    The United States is not satisfied with its existing military base network. It is still actively trying to further expand its military base network. One of its plans in this regard is to fill the "gap" between Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. According to Philip, a famous American military commentator and retired brigadier general, the U.S. ruling group hopes that by 1960 or earlier, the two base arcs, east and west, will be able to "merge."

    In order to strengthen its control over Central and South America, the United States is also extending its Caribbean base network to South America.

    The United States is also currently actively seeking to expand its military strongholds on the African continent. The recent trip to Africa by U.S. Vice President Nixon clearly had this purpose.

    By means of threats and inducements, the United States has made some progress in its activities to expand its military base network, such as obtaining the right to build military bases in Lebanon, Ethiopia, Brazil, and other countries.

        Eliminating Stains on the Map
    However, the trend of relaxation in the international situation, the growth of peaceful and neutral sentiments in the capitalist world, and the development of movements against U.S. military bases in various places - all of these are extremely unfavorable to the U.S. military expansion plan. Now, the people of the countries where U.S. military bases are located are increasingly feeling the humiliation and danger brought to them by the U.S. military bases. In many countries with U.S. military bases, such as Japan, the Philippines, Iceland, West Germany, and Britain, people's movements demanding "Yankee Go Home" have been launched to varying degrees. Under the pressure of the people, the governments of some countries have also expressed some reservations.

    Of course, the United States will never easily abandon its military base policy. This has been proven by many facts. The peace-loving forces of all countries must continue to struggle in order to finally eliminate these stains on the world map - the aggressive military bases of U.S. imperialism. (Attached picture)

    世界地图上的污点
    美国海外军事基地
    苑文
    在美帝国主义的全球侵略计划中，建筑海外军事基地占着重要的地位。根据美国官方消息统计，美国在本土以外以及在其他国家领土上建有主要空军基地一百二十余处、海军基地六十余处（地面部队和较小的辅助设施尚不包括在内），并且计划到1959年把空军基地增建至一百五十六处。根据美国政府发表的数字，自1951至1957这七个财政年度内，美国建筑海外军事基地的投资（已经签订条约并承担义务的费用）达六十三亿三千多万美元，其中尚不包括为数很大的秘密费用。此外，美国还强迫各侵略集团的成员国建筑大量的军事基地（譬如北大西洋集团已建成机场一百五十处），以供美国使用。
    矛头指向社会主义阵营
    美国在世界各地建筑军事基地的目的之一，是为了用军事力量包围和威胁以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。关于这一点，美国的重要军政人物从来都不隐讳。多年来，美国官方人物不断叫嚣要建立对社会主义阵营的军事包围圈；美国资产阶级的报刊更是经常谈论从这些基地攻击社会主义国家城市的这种那种方法。
    在美国军事基地网的实际部署上，读者可以从本文所附的地图上看出：由北极起，分别向东西两半球伸展，构成两条环绕着社会主义阵营的半月形弧线。到目前为止，根据美国官方材料，美国在东半球弧线上已建筑了主要空军基地四十余处，海军基地三十余处（包括较大的海军辅助基地）；在西半球弧线上建筑了主要空军基地将近八十处，海军基地将近三十处（也包括较大的海军辅助基地在内）。除此以外，美国还可以利用北大西洋公约、东南亚条约、美澳（大利亚）新（西兰）公约、巴格达条约以及通过各种双边军事协定，使用其它国家的一些军事基地。
        基地网的分布
    在美国的这两条军事弧线上各个地区的基地群，各有各的战略任务。
    阿拉斯加、阿留申群岛地区基地群——控制白令海峡和北太平洋，威胁苏联西伯利亚的工业中心。
    夏威夷群岛和东太平洋区基地群——美国通向远东的门户，也是远东美军的供应中心，作为侵略远东的级梯。
    西太平洋区基地群——以关岛为军事重心和后勤基地，以日本和菲律宾为南北两翼的指挥和供应中心，以南朝鲜、冲绳和台湾为第一线基地，从东边威胁社会主义阵营，首先是我国和亚洲其他人民民主国家。
    格林兰地区基地群——从北面威胁苏联欧洲部分工业中心。
    大西洋诸岛屿基地群——作为支援美国驻欧洲和北非的空军的中途供应和加油基地。
    欧洲地区基地群——这是从欧洲大陆进攻社会主义阵营、首先是东欧人民民主国家和苏联欧洲部分的主要前进基地网。
    北非和中东地区基地群——威胁苏联的中亚部分和南欧人民民主国家。
    在以上的部署中，应该特别提到美国在台湾的基地。这些基地是美国霸占我国领土台湾、直接威胁我国安全的军事据点。
      另一个更实际的目的
    但是，威胁社会主义阵营，绝不像美国官方竭力要使人相信的那样，是美国海外基地群的唯一目的。社会主义阵营的强大力量，已使美国及其追随者身受过不少教训，使得它们不能不考虑，如果真正来使用这些基地对社会主义国家试图发动进攻，将会遭到什么样的命运。正是因为如此，当美国官方大肆宣传所谓“集体安全”和“共同防御”时，实际上是怀着另一个秘而不宣、也是更为实际的目的——建立对其他国家的控制，镇压各国人民、特别是镇压亚非人民的民族独立运动。
    在东半球弧线上特别是太平洋地区的一系列基地群，也威胁印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、柬埔寨等新独立国家的安全，同时把日本、菲律宾等国置于美国的军事控制之下。
    在西半球，美国也企图利用它在北欧和西欧的一系列基地群，加强对加拿大和欧洲“盟国”的控制。美国目前积极策划在许多欧洲国家设置导弹基地，也是同这种目的有关的。而在南欧的基地群，则是美国控制地中海并排挤英法势力的工具。例如，美国在西班牙和地中海建立基地的一个重要目的就是：夺取一向为英国掌握的对地中海的控制地位。美国积极在北非和中东建立基地，其当前主要目的就是为了便于镇压这一地区中汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动，同时排挤英法等老牌殖民势力。
    除了前面介绍过的东半球基地弧线和西半球基地弧线之外，美国还在加勒比海一带建立
  了巨大的军事基地网（目前已建成空军基地二处、海军基地七处）。这些基地的主要作用就是保证美国对中南美洲国家的政治控制和经济掠夺。
        进一步扩张的目标
    美国并没有满足于它现有的军事基地网。它还在积极设法进一步扩张它的军事基地网。它在这方面的一项计划是把沙特阿拉伯至菲律宾之间的“缺口”填补起来。据美国著名的军事评论家、退休准将菲利浦透露，美国统治集团希望到1960年或者更早一些，能够使东西两条基地弧线“合龙”。
    为了加强对中南美洲的控制，美国也正在把它的加勒比海基地网向南美伸展。
    美国目前还积极想扩大它在非洲大陆的军事据点。前不久美国副总统尼克松的非洲之行，就明显地抱着这种目的。
    靠着威胁和利诱，美国在它的扩张军事基地网的活动中，有了一些进展，例如取得了在黎巴嫩、埃塞俄比亚、巴西等国建筑军事基地的权利。
        清除地图上的污点
    但是，国际总形势的趋向缓和、资本主义世界中和平中立情绪的增长、各地反对美国军事基地的运动的发展——这些都对美国的军事扩张计划极为不利。现在，美国军事基地所在国的人民已经越来越感受到美国的军事基地带给他们的屈辱和危险。在日本、菲律宾、冰岛、西德、英国等许多设有美国军事基地的国家里，都展开了程度不等的要求“美国佬滚回去”的人民运动。在人民的压力下，一些国家的政府也表示了某种保留的态度。
    当然，美国绝不会轻易放弃它的军事基地政策。这已经有不少事实证明。各国爱好和平的力量要达到最后清除世界地图上的这些污点——美帝国主义的侵略性军事基地，还须继续进行斗争。（附图片）
