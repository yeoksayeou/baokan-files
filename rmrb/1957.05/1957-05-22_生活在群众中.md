    Living Among the Masses
    Cao Baoming, Chen Mu
    Comrade Han Xi is the director and Party branch committee member of the Third Construction Site of the Concrete Company of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Company. He used to drive carts on the Northeast Plain, joined the army and the Party after 1946, and served as a company commander. He only transferred to work on a construction site after being wounded on the Korean battlefield in 1952. His education level is not high, and he doesn't understand technology, but he leads the modernized construction site very well. The Party Committee of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company believes that he is a typical example of going deep into the masses and caring for the masses. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee also called on cadres of industrial and transportation enterprises throughout the province to earnestly learn from his experience.
    
    Teaching Family Members How to Light a Stove
    Last April, he had just led a group of workers from the Northeast to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works construction site.
    In the evening, he went home for dinner. As soon as he entered the door, he saw the room filled with smoke, and one of the younger children was crying loudly. His wife couldn't figure out how to use the small stove in the South and couldn't get the fire started, so she was getting anxious. Fortunately, he had stayed in the South with the army and knew how to light a fire in the South, so he immediately took the stove outside and started the fire himself.
    As soon as the fire was lit, he thought that the workers from the Northeast who came with him would probably encounter the same difficulties. So, he immediately stood up and walked out. Sure enough, when he arrived at other workers' homes, he saw many workers' family members with runny noses and tears from the smoke. Some workers were losing their tempers because they couldn't get food, and some women were scolding "this damn place that makes things difficult for everyone." He immediately introduced the method of lighting a fire in the South to everyone. Before he finished speaking, several young women who were still rubbing their noses and wiping their tears couldn't help but laugh.
    "What are you laughing at?"
    "Seeing you, the big director, teaching the workers how to work on the construction site, and teaching our family members how to light a fire when you get home."
    The next day, Han Xi found the full-time cadres of the Party branch, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and discussed with them: "The worker comrades have just come from the Northeast, and they probably have many difficulties. Let's go and see." Several responsible persons visited the workers' dormitories to see if their families were settled and what difficulties they had. Han Xi also explained the customs of the South to everyone and told them to pay attention.
    Soon, Wuhan entered the summer season. The Northeastern workers who had just arrived in the South had never experienced such heat in Wuhan, and many people wanted to return to the Northeast. Some even said, "We will either die of heat or shed a layer of skin here." After studying this situation, the Party branch conducted education for the workers separately. Han Xi also told everyone about the situation of the Fourth Field Army going south: "In such hot weather, the troops had no place to live and nothing to eat, and they had to carry their guns and run two hundred miles a day to chase the enemy and fight. Our working class can make mountains bow their heads and rivers make way. Why can't we overcome this summer heat?" He also calculated an account with everyone: it costs one hundred and eight yuan for a worker to come from the Northeast to Wuhan, including travel and luggage expenses. "If we go back without building anything, how can we face the country, how can we face our fellow villagers?" At the same time, Han Xi also personally supervised the construction of sunshades on the construction site, boiled mung bean soup, distributed salt soda, and conscientiously implemented the company's heatstroke prevention measures to solve the workers' practical difficulties. In this way, the workers' morale stabilized.
    Usually, on Sundays, Han Xi often went to the workers' homes with the deputy secretary of the branch, Li Baohua, carrying their children. When it rained heavily at night, they often slipped and stumbled to check the workers' accommodation...
    
    Why is Old Qu Unhappy?
    Last "May Day," Han Xi was resting at home. A worker in his fifties strode in and shouted, "Director Han, you have to sum up my work. How many achievements have I made since 1952, and how much funds have I accumulated for the country?"
    This worker's name is Qu Shixian. He has a bit of a quirky temper and is always dissatisfied with the leaders. He also has a shortcoming of liking to "slip away" (absenteeism). Last year, he asked for leave to return to his hometown in Shandong, and repeatedly said before leaving that he would return on time, but he was still three days late. Han Xi criticized him. As a result, he had more opinions about the leaders, and he didn't speak when he saw Han Xi. Sometimes, when he saw Han Xi coming from the east, he would detour from the west.
    At this time, Han Xi greeted him to sit down and offered him a cigarette. But he shook his hand and said angrily, "I don't smoke!" A gust of alcohol immediately hit him. Then, he said drunkenly, "Everyone says you have a good mass viewpoint and can talk to the workers, and I think so too. But why don't you talk to me?" Han Xi heard that there was something behind his words and wanted to talk to him, but he saw that he was drunk and it was difficult to talk, so he advised him: "Okay, we must have a good talk. But today is 'May Day,' we have to have fun for a day. How about we talk next Sunday?"
    On Sunday, Qu Shixian came. He asked bluntly, "When did you come to the construction site?" "September 27. Why do you ask?" "Hey, why didn't you say so earlier! If you had come to the construction site before August, I would have had to ask you to sum up my work." Then, the old worker talked incoherently about how he picked up foreign nails and saved materials, and he didn't talk about anything, and he left.
    Why did this old worker run over angrily, talk nonsense for a while, and then leave? Han Xi thought for a long time before he suddenly realized: although this old man has shortcomings, he still wants to make progress. He always wanted to invent something to save materials for the country, but the numbers he came up with were not big, and no one cared about them. He could also play the erhu. Sometimes, when the construction site held an evening party, he would automatically accompany the music, and he would still go to work as usual the next day. In Old Qu's view, this was to show his progress, but Han Xi and everyone didn't pay attention. Once, he was a few minutes late for an evening party, and Han Xi said a few words to him. Therefore, he felt that the leaders were unfair. At this time, Han Xi blamed himself: "When a person has shortcomings, why do we always look at his shortcomings and not see his advantages and care about his progress?"
    Soon, this old worker made a box for testing the hardness of concrete, saving more than forty yuan. Han Xi said to the deputy director: "In this month's summary, we must mention Old Qu's matter and praise him." This praise made Old Qu very happy. As soon as he saw Han Xi, he greeted him from afar: "Old Han, you have finally seen me clearly! I have another suggestion: I don't want the bonus, give it to our team. I only ask that my matter be written in that 'Socialist Construction Contribution' booklet. This is my honor."
    Because Han Xi corrected the shortcomings in his leadership work, this old worker became more and more active and became an activist.
    
      "Zhang the Timid" Dares to Take Responsibility
    Zhang Bin, the technical deputy director of the Third Construction Site, graduated from university in 1944. He worked in the Nanjing Public Works Bureau before liberation. At that time, he saw that his section chief always "asked the director for instructions" when encountering something. As a result, in the old society where there was a new emperor every dynasty, this section chief never changed every time the director changed. Therefore, he also learned this set of principles of "asking for instructions when something happens and making fewer decisions." After liberation, he still hadn't changed his fear of taking responsibility. Once, he made a mistake in the work record and issued the wrong wages. The branch secretary was a little dissatisfied, so he was so scared that he didn't dare to work on the construction site and wanted to be transferred to the company. So some people called him "Zhang the Timid."
    Last year, he was promoted from foreman to deputy director of the construction site. He thought: in the past, I was the same cadre as the foremen, but now I have to lead them. How can I do it? He was even more hesitant in his work and dared not boldly take responsibility, and he usually handled some trivial administrative work. Han Xi said to him: "Old Zhang, you have to study engineering technology. Let me handle these things!" He took over the administrative work.
    The production meeting was presided over by Zhang Bin. Gu Zhanchen, the concrete pouring team leader, was always late for meetings, and he dragged on the things that Zhang Bin decided at the meeting. Han Xi criticized Gu Zhanchen at the meeting. After the meeting, Han Xi also said to Gu Zhanchen: "You can be rude to me. Director Zhang, he is a technical cadre, and it is not right to treat him like this."
    Zhang Bin lacked experience in leadership work. He often didn't sound out the masses beforehand, and he didn't dare to make decisions when he encountered problems, and he always beat around the bush when he spoke. The Party branch introduced Zhang Bin to read the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Leadership Methods." Han Xi also often said to him: "Talk to the masses about everything beforehand, sound them out, have a number in your mind, and speak with evidence and with the support of the masses, it will be easy to handle." Last October, when the No. 4 Pumping Station poured concrete for the second time, it was necessary to tie up scaffolding. Zhang Bin consulted with the workers in advance before assigning the task to the foreman. At that time, the foreman emphasized the difficulties and disagreed with Zhang Bin's decision. Zhang Bin said: "The scaffolders all say that this can be done, and we have calculated that it can be done. Why do you say it can't be done?" The foreman had nothing to say and accepted the task. The work task was also completed smoothly.
    A Story
    Because Han Xi took the lead in caring for the workers' lives and thoughts, and regarded the workers' joys and sorrows as his own, a new atmosphere of going deep into the masses and caring for the masses has formed among the cadres of the Third Construction Site. After Gu Zhanchen, the concrete pouring team leader, actively helped the workers solve their living difficulties, he had this experience: "In the past, workers only looked for the foreman when they encountered production matters, but now they also look for the foreman for living matters." He felt that the relationship with the workers was much closer.
    Why can Han Xi take the lead in doing this? Before answering this question, Han Xi told a story:
    In 1949, when he was the deputy company commander, he was suppressing bandits in Longtan, Xiangxi, and captured the bandit leader Wu Chenghong. This bandit leader could run as fast as a dog. After he ran into the mountains, it was difficult to find him. Han Xi and his comrades followed the Party's instructions, implemented the policy of rent reduction and interest reduction in the village, implemented reasonable burdens, and mobilized the masses. When the masses' awareness was raised, no one delivered food to the Wu bandits, and the Wu bandits couldn't stay in the mountains and secretly returned to the village. However, Han Xi had never seen what Wu Chenghong looked like. Once, Han Xi was helping an old woman work in the fields, so he inquired about him. She shouted loudly to a person beside the field who was staring at Han Xi and asked, "Have you seen Wu Chenghong?" It caught Han Xi's attention, and the man hesitated and walked away. As soon as he returned to the village, the old woman whispered to him: "The person beside the field just now was Wu Chenghong." "Why didn't you say it just now?" "Hey, didn't you see that the short gun in his pocket was bulging at you? If I said it, he would have shot you, and he wouldn't have been caught. If I asked like this, wouldn't you have seen his appearance clearly, and he wouldn't have shot you?" A few days later, the masses secretly reported: "Wu Chenghong is back again and is hiding in the grain cabinet." Han Xi took two people in through the front door. The Wu bandits had already run out of the back door when they heard the news. However, because Han Xi had already recognized Wu bandit's appearance, he followed closely behind and fired seven shots in a row, killing the bandit leader on the spot.
      "You see, if you don't care about the masses and rely on the masses, you won't only fail to kill the bandit leader, but you won't even be able to save your own life. Therefore, after transferring to an industrial post, I have always remembered this: a Party member must care about the masses and rely on the masses. This is also a responsibility that a Communist Party member should have."

    生活在群众中
    曹葆铭　陈牧
    韩喜同志是武汉冶金建筑公司混凝土公司第三工地的主任，党支部委员。他原来在东北平原赶大车，1946年以后参军，入党，当过连长。1952年在朝鲜战场负伤以后，才转业到建筑工地工作。他的文化程度不高，又不懂技术，但是把现代化施工的工地领导得很好。武汉冶金建筑总公司党委认为他是深入群众、关心群众的典型。湖北省委也号召全省工业交通企业的干部认真学习他的经验。
    教给家属生炉子
    去年4月，他刚领了一批工人从东北来到武钢工地。
    傍晚，他回家吃饭。一进门，就见屋里烟雾腾腾，小的一个孩子在哇哇哭，他妻子因为不会摆弄南方的小炉子，生不着火，正在发急。幸亏他随部队在南方呆过，懂得南方生火的方法，马上就将炉子端出门外，自己动手来生火。
    火刚生着，他想起跟他同来的东北工人大概一定也会遇到同样的困难。于是，他马上站起来就往外走。果然，他一到别的工人家里，就见许多工人家属被烟熏得又流鼻涕又流泪，有的工人因为吃不上饭在发脾气，有的妇女在骂“这个处处给人为难的鬼地方”。他立即向大家介绍了南方生火的方法。他的话还没有讲完，几个还在揉鼻子抹眼泪的青年妇女就忍不住笑起来了。
    “你们笑什么？”
    “看你这大主任，在工地上要教工人咋干活，回家来还要教我们家属生火。”
    第二天，韩喜找到党支部和工会、青年团的专职干部，同他们商量：“工人同志们刚从东北来，大概困难多着啦，咱们得看看去。”几个负责人便挨家访问工人宿舍，看他们的家安顿好没有，有什么困难。韩喜还给大家讲解南方的风俗习惯，要大家注意。
    不久，武汉进入暑季。初来南方的东北工人都没经过武汉这样的酷热，许多人想回东北去。有的还说：“在这里热不死，也要脱层皮。”党支部研究了这个情况，又分头向工人进行教育。韩喜还向大家讲第四野战军南下的情况：“在这样的热天，部队没住处，没吃的，还要背着大枪一天跑二百里，追敌人，打仗。我们工人阶级能够叫高山低头，河水让路，为什么就不能战胜这暑热呢？”他还同大伙算了一笔帐：一个工人由东北来武汉，光车费和行李运费就要一百零八元，“我们没有建设什么就回去，怎么对得起国家，怎么有脸见乡亲？”同时，韩喜也亲自督促在工地搭凉棚，煮绿豆汤，发盐汽水，认真实行公司的防暑措施，解决工人的实际困难。这样，工人情绪就安定下来了。
    在平时，每逢星期天，韩喜常同支部副书记李宝华抱着孩子到工人家里去串门。夜晚碰到下大雨，他们常一步一滑地赶去查看工人的住宿……。
    瞿老头为什么不高兴？
    去年“五一”，韩喜正在家里休息。一个五十多岁的工人一跨进门来就嚷道：“韩主任，你得把我的工作总结总结。打1952年到现在，我有多少成绩，为国家积累了多少资金？”
    这个工人叫瞿世先，脾气有点古怪，对领导老是不满。他还有个爱“溜号”（缺勤）的缺点。去年他请假回山东老家，临行前再三说要按期回来，结果还是迟了三天。韩喜批评了他。这样一来，他对领导意见更大，见了韩喜不说话。有时候，见韩喜从东边来，他便从西边绕过去。
    这时候，韩喜招呼他坐，递烟给他。他却把手一甩，气呼呼地说：“不抽！”迎面就扑来一股酒气。接着，他又醉醺醺地说：“大家都说你群众观点好，同工人谈得来，我也这样看。可是，你为啥不找我谈谈呢？”韩喜一听他话里有话，很想同他谈谈，但又见他醉了，很难谈，便劝他说：“好呀，咱们一定要好好谈谈。不过，今天是‘五一’节，得乐一天，咱们下个星期天再谈好不好？”
    星期天，瞿世先来了。他劈头就问：“你什么时候上工地的？”“9月27。你问这干啥？”“嗨，你怎么不早说！你要是8月以前上的工地，我就非得要你给我总结总结工作不可。”接着，这个老工人又啰啰嗦嗦地谈起他怎样捡洋钉，节约材料，啥问题也没谈出来，就走了。
    这个老工人为什么气呼呼地跑来，没头没脑地讲了一顿又走了呢？韩喜想了很久，才恍然大悟：这老头虽然有缺点，但他还想上进。他老想发明个什么东西为国家节约材料，但搞的数字都不大，没人看得上眼。他还会拉胡琴，有时工地开个晚会，他就自动去伴奏，第二天还照常上工。在老瞿，这是要表现他的进步，但韩喜和大伙都没注意。有次，他开晚会迟到了几分钟，韩喜还说了他两句。因此，他就认为领导不公平。韩喜这时候就责备自己：“一个人有缺点，为什么就老看他的缺点，而看不见人家的优点，关心人家的进步呢？”
    不久，这个老工人做试验混凝土硬度的盒子，节约了四十多元。韩喜就对副主任讲：“这次月底总结，一定把老瞿的事儿也说上，表扬一下。”这一下，可把老瞿表扬好了。他一见韩喜，老远就招呼道：“老韩哪，你们算是看清我啦！我还有个意见：奖金我不要，给我们小组。我只要求把我这事儿写在那本‘社会主义建设贡献’册子上。这是我的荣誉。”
    由于韩喜改正了领导工作中的缺点，这个老工人就越来越积极，成了个积极分子。
      “张胆小”敢负责了
    第三工地的技术副主任张斌，是1944年大学毕业的。他解放前在南京工务局工作，当时他看见他的科长遇事都是“请局座批示”，结果在一朝天子一朝臣的旧社会里，每次换局长也没换这个科长。因此他也学会了“有事请示，少作决定”的这套处事原则。解放以后，他这种怕负责任的思想还没改掉。有一次，他将记工单弄错了，错发了工资，支部书记有些不满意，他就吓得不敢在工地工作，想调到公司里去。所以有人叫他“张胆小”。
    去年，他由工段长升为工地副主任。他想：过去跟工段长们都是一样的干部，现在要领导他们，怎么行？工作上更是缩手缩脚，不敢大胆负责，平日细细末末地搞些事务工作。韩喜就向他讲：“老张，你得钻研工程技术，这些事儿让我办吧！”把事务工作接过手来了。
    生产碰头会由张斌主持。混凝土浇灌队长顾占臣开会老迟到，张斌在会上决定的事情，他也拖着不办。韩喜就在碰头会上批评了顾占臣。会后，韩喜又找顾占臣说：“你对我发态度都行。张主任，他是技术干部，待他这样就不行。”
    张斌缺乏领导工作的经验，往往事前没有在群众中摸底，遇着问题不敢作决定，说话老绕圈子。党支部便介绍张斌阅读党中央的“关于领导方法的决定”。韩喜也时常向他讲：“什么事先下去找群众谈谈，摸摸底，心中有个数，说出话来有根有据，有群众支持，就好办了。”去年10月，四号水泵站二次浇灌混凝土要绑架子，张斌就事先找工人商量了，才向工段长布置任务。当时，工段长强调困难，不同意张斌的决定，张斌便说道：“架子工都说这样做能行，我们计算过也认为能行，你为什么说不能行呢？”工段长没话说了，才接受了任务。工作任务也顺利完成了。
    一段故事
    由于韩喜带头关心工人的生活和思想，把工人的甘苦当作自己的甘苦，在第三工地的干部中已经形成了一种深入群众、关心群众的新风气。混凝土浇灌队长顾占臣积极帮助工人解决生活困难问题以后，便有这样的体会：“过去工人遇到生产上的事才找工长，现在生活上的事也找工长了。”感到同工人的关系密切多了。
    为什么韩喜能带头这样作呢？在回答这个问题之前，韩喜讲了一段故事：
    1949年，他当副连长，在湘西龙潭剿匪，捉匪首吴成洪。这个匪首能跑得跟狗一样快。他跑到山里以后，就很难找到他。韩喜他们就按照党的指示，在村里贯彻减租减息政策，实行合理负担，发动群众。当群众觉悟提高以后，谁都不给吴匪送饭，吴匪在山里呆不住，偷偷回到村里来。但是，吴成洪是什么样子，韩喜没见过。有一次，韩喜在地里帮助一个老太婆干活，便向她打听。她却大声叫着地边上的一个死死盯住韩喜的人问道：“你看见吴成洪没有？”引起韩喜注意，这人才吱唔了一句，走开了。一回到村来，老太婆就低声告诉他：“刚才地边上那个人就是吴成洪。”“你刚才为什么不讲？”“唉，你没见他兜里的短枪正朝你鼓着吗？我要一说，他把你打了，还捉不住他哩。我这样问问，你不就看清他的模样，他也不打你了吗？”不几天，又有群众来密报：“吴成洪又回来了，躲在粮柜里面。”韩喜带了两个人从前门进去，吴匪早已闻风从后门跑了。但是，因为韩喜已经认清了吴匪的模样，便紧跟在后面直追，对准连发了七枪，当场将这个匪首击毙。
      “你看，要不关心群众，依靠群众，不仅打不死匪首，连自己的性命也保不住哩。所以转到工业岗位以后，我还始终记住这点：一个党员必须关心群众，依靠群众。这也是一个共产党员应有的责任。”（附图片）
