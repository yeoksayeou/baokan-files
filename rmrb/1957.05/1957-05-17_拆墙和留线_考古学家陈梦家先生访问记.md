    Demolishing Walls and Keeping Lines
    --An Interview with Archaeologist Mr. Chen Mengjia--
  　"It would be great if the relationship between the Party and the masses could be as free and unconstrained as our conversation today." This was the last sentence Mr. Chen Mengjia said when the reporter interviewed him on the topic of rectification. Mr. Chen was a poet of the Crescent Moon Society in the past. Although he later switched to archaeology, his heroic and enthusiastic temperament as a poet has not changed. Although the topic of today's interview—"As a scholar, what are your requirements for this Party rectification?"—is easy to become dry, Mr. Chen still expressed his opinions vividly and kindly. Our conversation took place in an atmosphere of heart-to-heart talk between comrades, as if everyone had forgotten that this was an interview!
    The conversation began with some issues concerning the relationship between the Party and the masses.
    It is possible to sense the estrangement in the relationship between the Party and the masses in the Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Archaeology from Mr. Chen's conversation. He said: "We can say that we have no contact with the Party Committee or Party Branch of the Academy and the Institute. We don’t know what relationship the Party Committee or Party Group of the organization has with the administration, whether the Party organization of the Institute of Archaeology is a Party branch or a Party group, or who the负责人 is. In the past few years, except for attending a meeting for senior intellectuals joining the Party, there has been no other contact."

    Non-Party members can embody the leadership of the Party
    Mr. Chen said: "We very much hope to clarify the distinction between the leadership of the Party and the leadership of individual Party members. There is no problem that the Party should lead science. But this probably has nothing to do with whether the administrative负责人 is a Party member or a non-Party member. It can also be said that non-Party members who serve as administrative leaders and implement the Party's policies embody the Party's leadership. At present, it seems that to embody the Party's leadership, one must be a Party member. If a Party member领导 comrade does not work well, and we oppose him, some people think that this is opposing the Party's leadership. In this way, individual Party members are regarded as representatives of the Party. If he is wrong, others cannot criticize him. In fact, in technically strong departments like the Institute of Archaeology, if there are no Party member experts, it is also possible to let non-Party member experts lead. After several years of study, these non-Party comrades can also grasp the Party's guidelines and policies." He cited Archaeology Newsletter as an example. This publication is edited by a non-Party member. In the past, whenever the publication published a commentary, the editor-in-chief did not dare to decide on his own and had to ask the Party member负责人 comrade to read it, fearing that there would be errors. In fact, the professional level of this Party member负责人 comrade may not be much higher than that of the non-Party member editor-in-chief. Is it necessary to do this? At the same time, I hope that through this rectification, it will be possible to adjust Party member领导 comrades. Some people are not suitable for their positions, some hold too many concurrent positions, and some are nominal, all of which can be considered for adjustment. In academic and cultural departments, the poor relationship between the Party and the masses is sometimes related to the inappropriate arrangements of these 领导 comrades."

    The scope of the confidentiality system is too broad
    Mr. Chen said: "It is necessary for the Party to have a certain confidentiality system in order to maintain its own purity. We don’t want to know the secrets within the Party either, but in the past, the scope of confidentiality seemed to be too broad. Some professional issues were not allowed to be asked about by non-Party members. For example, we senior researchers were not allowed to know about things like the Institute of Archaeology sending graduate students to study in the Soviet Union or Deputy Director Xia Nai going abroad to participate in the Paris Sinologists Conference. This is strange. At that time, I asked a Party member负责人 comrade about these two things, and he even嫌 me 多事. I said that these two things are related to our work, and I have to ask. I know the level of the graduate students; the three comrades (all Party and团员 members) initially selected by the institute were too low in their level. I made suggestions, but they were not adopted, and as a result, they still failed the exam. I have work to hand over when Deputy Director Xia goes abroad. Why shouldn't I know? Moreover, comrades outside the institute already knew about this, so why shouldn't comrades inside the institute know?"
   "Currently, there seems to be a personnel reporting system. If you say a sentence or do something in a certain place, the head will know it soon, and sometimes the head will quote it when speaking. It is okay to report the major activities of non-Party members, but often even trivial matters are reported. Once I entertained foreign guests and wore a suit without a tie, it was also reported by Party团员 members to the organization head, and soon I was criticized in person. Doing so often easily trusts the one-sided words of Party团员 members, and it is also unnecessary."

    Personnel work has great mystery
   "Personnel work in the organization is also made very mysterious. Now it seems that personnel work is the work of the Party. All personnel cadres are Party members, and it is difficult for non-Party members to ask about personnel issues, which also creates some difficulties in the work. Sometimes there is a lack of trust in non-Party members. Once a Party member负责干部 came to me suddenly. Judging from his look when he entered the door, of course something was up today. I asked him what he wanted, but he refused to say. After sitting for a long time, he asked me if I knew anything about an American named 'Wilson'. Why not ask me directly at the beginning about things like this? Moreover, this comrade doesn't understand English and doesn't give me the original name to look at. The American 'Wilson' is like the Chinese surname Zhang, numbering in the millions. Who am I supposed to know? In fact, we are all patriotic. If you ask me directly, I will definitely tell you what I know. Why be so mysterious?"

    The result of the rectification should be explained
    Mr. Chen said: "In the past, when we carried out the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, there was often no explanation for comrades who made mistakes. After criticizing someone, there was no follow-up on what happened to the criticized person. This is a question for both the critics and the criticized. I hope that there will be an explanation for this Party rectification. Everyone has raised many opinions about a certain Party member comrade. How things really are should be told to everyone. This can let the masses know which of their opinions are right and which are wrong, and also let the comrades who have made mistakes know where their mistakes lie. A few days ago, I met a Party member comrade at a meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He said that he still has concerns about whether to 放 or not. The reason is that some leaders said not to 放 in the past, and today they are the ones saying to 放. They don’t examine themselves, and only criticize others. Today they 放, and tomorrow they will criticize you for not 放! These leaders should examine themselves, talk to everyone about their experiences, and not just criticize others."

    The Academy of Sciences is a Yamen
    Speaking of bureaucracy, Mr. Chen has opinions on the leaders of the Academy of Sciences, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, and the Institute of Archaeology.
    Mr. Chen said: "The Academy of Sciences is actually a Yamen, and the leaders at all levels are large and small officials. These people rarely have contact with researchers. For example, there is a Party member Vice President of the Academy of Sciences in charge of social sciences. Originally it was Zhang Jiafu, and later it was Zhang Jingfu, but whether it was Zhang Jiafu or Zhang Jingfu, we only saw them on the stage, and there was no other relationship."
    He reminded the reporter: "This time, the Hundred Schools of Thought, the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences鳴 the worst. Other aspects have meetings and are lively, but the social science aspect is 冷冷清清. The Department of Social Sciences also held a meeting to discuss it, but at that time, only Mr. Xu Bingchang and I and a few others spoke, and no one else spoke. The meeting ended hastily. A Party member comrade in charge of the department has been in the department for two years, and he doesn't even know our senior researchers. I criticized him at the meeting. Most of the members of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences are Party members, and very few people have time to do scientific research. They were not elected by us. Some people say that there is sectarianism here, which is worth examining."
   "There is also a lot of bureaucracy within the Institute of Archaeology. Some Party member leadership cadres don't understand the situation below and don't come to the office often. They like to listen to small reports. Sometimes they ask you to talk, not to criticize, but to lecture. He often wants us old scientists not to闹不团结, but he rarely strives for unity between him and us. Certain Party member leadership comrades do not respect some older researchers. They are old and want to go to see various places, but they always consider this and that, and do not let them go out."

    Taking the words of the leaders as golden rules
    Finally, we talked about the issue of dogmatism. Mr. Chen said: "Now there seems to be a new kind of dogmatism. Some people take the words of the leaders as golden rules and only try to figure out and understand the intentions of the leaders, regardless of the actual situation. For example, a leadership comrade casually said a sentence, saying how 李后主's poems are people-oriented, and some people made a big fuss about it. The leaders said that the reform of the writing system should follow the direction of pinyin, and they blindly carried out the reform of the writing system without asking what the specific conditions were. Similar situations occurred during the reform of opera in the past. A leadership comrade watched "San Cha Kou" and said that Liu Lihua should be a good person, and the next day Liu Lihua became a hero on the stage. Doing so will only produce bad results."
   "Some people say that the relationship between the Party and the masses should be to demolish walls and keep lines. I don’t think there is a need to keep lines. It is like playing football. How great it would be if people on both sides could串来串去? Without keeping lines, we can still distinguish between the Communist Party and the masses." This is Mr. Chen's final requirement.

    拆墙和留线
    ——考古学家陈梦家先生访问记——
  　“党群关系，能像今天我们谈话这样自由，这样没有拘束就好了。”这是记者就整风问题访问考古学家陈梦家先生的时候，陈先生最后说的一句话。陈先生过去是新月派的诗人，后来虽然改业考古，但诗人的豪迈热情的气质并没有改变。虽然记者今天访问的题目——“作为一个学者，对这次党内整风有什么要求？”容易谈得枯燥，陈先生还是生动亲切地讲出了自己的意见。我们的谈话是在一种同志间谈心的气氛中进行的，说话之间，好像谁都忘了这是一次采访呢！　　谈话是先从党群关系的一些问题上开始的。　　科学院和考古研究所的党群关系隔膜，这是可以从陈先生的谈话中感觉出来的。他说：“我们和院、所的党委或党支部可以说没有什么联系。机关的党委或党组到底和行政有什么关系，考古所的党组织是一个党支部还是党小组，负责人是谁，我们都不知道。几年来，除了参加过一次高级知识分子入党大会以外，就再也没有其他来往了。”
    非党同志可以体现党的领导
    陈先生说：“我们很希望弄清党的领导和个别党员的领导区别在那里。党应该领导科学，这是没有问题的。但这恐怕和行政负责人是党员还是非党员没有关系。非党员担任行政领导，贯彻党的政策，也可以说是体现了党的领导。目前好像要体现党的领导，必须是党员，如果一个党员领导同志工作得不好，我们反对他，有人认为这就是反对党的领导。这样就把个别党员当成了党的代表。他错了，人家也不能批评他。事实上像考古所这样技术性较强的部门，如果没有党员专家，让非党员专家来领导也是可以的。经过这几年的学习，这些非党同志也能掌握党的方针政策。他举考古通讯为例，这个刊物由非党同志主编。过去刊物上每发表评论，主编自己不敢决定，必须请党员负责同志看过，恐怕出错误。其实这位党员负责同志的业务水平不一定比非党同志的主编高多少，这样做是否必要呢？同时希望经过这次整风，能够对党员领导同志作一次调整。有些人人地不相宜，有些人兼职过多，有些人是挂名的，都可以考虑调整。在学术文化部门，党群关系搞不好，有些时候是和这些领导同志安排得不合适有关系。”
    保密制度范围太宽
    陈先生说：“党为了保持自身的纯洁，要有一定的保密制度，这是必要的。我们也不想知道党内的秘密，但过去保密范围似乎太宽了一点，有些业务上的问题，也不大允许非党同志过问。例如像考古所选派留苏研究生、夏鼐副所长出国参加巴黎汉学家会议这样的事情，也不让我们这些高级研究人员知道，这未免奇怪，当时我曾将这两件事情问过一个党员负责同志，他还嫌我多事。我说这两件事和我们业务有关，我不能不问。研究生的程度怎样，我知道；当时所内选定的三个同志（都是党、团员）程度太低，我提了意见，他们没有采纳，结果还是没有考上。夏副所长出国，我有工作要交代，为什么不应该知道？而且这件事所外的同志已经知道了，为什么所内的同志反而不应该知道呢？”
   “目前似乎有一种人事汇报制度，你在某个地方讲了一句话，做了一件事，不久首长就会知道，有时首长讲话时就会引用起来。非党同志的重大活动向上汇报是可以的，但往往连一些琐屑小事也汇报了。一次我招待外宾，穿了西装没有带领结，也给党团员汇报给机关首长知道了，不久就当面批评。这样做往往容易听信党团员一面之辞，而且也没有必要。”
    人事工作神秘性很大
   “机关的人事工作，也弄得神秘性很大。现在人事工作好像就是党的工作，作人事干部的都是党员，非党同志对人事问题很难过问，这也造成工作中的一些困难。有时对非党同志不大信任。一次一个党员负责干部突来找我。由进门的神气看来，今天来了当然有事。我问他来意如何，他始终不肯说。坐了半天，才问我美国有一个‘威尔逊’你了解不了解。像这样的事，为什么不一开始就直接了当的问我呢？而且这位同志还不懂英文，不给原文名字给我看。美国的‘威尔逊’等于中国的姓张的一样，何止千万，我知道是谁呢？其实我们都是爱国的，你直接了当地问我，我一定会尽自己知道的告诉你，为什么要这样神秘呢？”
    整风的结果要有交代
    陈先生说：“过去搞三反、肃反，对犯错误的同志往往没有个交代，将人家批评了一顿，最后被批评者到底是怎么回事，没有下文了。这样对批评者和被批评者都是一个疑问。这次党内整风，希望要有个交代。大家对某个党员同志提了不少意见，事实怎样应该告诉大家，这可使群众知道自己的意见那些对、那些不对，也可使犯错误的同志知道错误何在。前几天我在文联开会，遇到一个党员同志，他说目前对放不放的问题自己还有顾虑。原因是有些领导人，过去说不放是他们，今天说放也是他们。他们不检查自己，光批评别人。今天放了，明天他又会批评你不该放呢！这些领导同志应该自己检查检查，向大家说说自己的体会，不要光批评别人。”
    科学院是个衙门
    说起官僚主义，陈先生对科学院、哲学社会科学学部和考古所的领导都有意见。
    陈先生说：“科学院实际上是一个衙门，层层的领导都是些大大小小的官。这些人很少和研究人员接触。举例说：科学院有一个党员副院长专管社会科学，原来是张稼夫，后来是张劲夫，但不论是张稼夫还是张劲夫；我们都只在台上见到他们，除此以外别无关系。”
    他提醒记者说：“这次百家争鸣，哲学社会科学学部鸣得最不好。别的方面都开会，搞得热热闹闹，就是社会科学方面冷冷清清，社会科学学部也曾经开过一次会讨论，当时会上只有徐炳昶老先生和我并少数二三人发了言，别人都不讲话，会议草草收场。负责学部的一个党员同志来学部已二年了，连我们这些高级研究人员都不认识，会上我就曾给予批评。哲学社会科学学部的委员大部分是党员，真正有时间作科学研究的人很少，他们都不是我们选举出来的。有人说，这里有宗派主义，值得检查。”
   “考古所内官僚主义也是不少的。有些党员领导干部，不大了解下情，也不大到办公室来。他们喜欢听小报告，有时请你去谈，不是批评，就是训话。他经常要我们老科学家之间不要闹不团结，但他很少努力于他和我们之间的团结。某些党员领导同志对一些年老的研究员，不大尊重。他们年纪大了，很想到各地去看看，总是考虑这考虑那，不让出去。”
    把领导人的话当作金科玉律
    最后，我们谈到了教条主义的问题。陈先生说：“现在似乎出现了一种新的教条主义，某些人把领导的话当作金科玉律，只是去揣摩和体会领导的意图，不管实际情况。例如有个领导同志，随便讲了一句话，说李后主的词人民性如何，某些人就据此大做文章。领导说文字改革要走拼音化方向，就不问具体条件怎样，盲目进行文字改革。过去戏曲改革时也发生过类似情况。有个领导同志看了“三岔口”说刘利华应该是好人，第二天的戏台上刘利华变成好汉了。这样做只会产生不好的结果。”
   “有人说党群关系应该拆墙留线，我觉得线也不必留，和踢足球一样，两边的人串来串去多好呢？不留线，也能分出共产党和群众。”这就是陈先生的最后要求。
