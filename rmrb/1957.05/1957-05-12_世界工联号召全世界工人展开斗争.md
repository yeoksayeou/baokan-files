According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions recently passed an appeal calling on trade union members worldwide to launch a struggle to stop nuclear weapons testing.

The appeal pointed out that the nuclear arms race and continuous hydrogen bomb tests endanger humanity and cause deep anxiety among the people. This anxiety has been exacerbated by the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces to be equipped with atomic nuclear weapons.

The World Federation of Trade Unions reaffirmed its declaration of April 29, 1954, against the testing and use of these weapons, and believes that the first step on this path should be an agreement between major powers to end nuclear testing.

The World Federation of Trade Unions finally solemnly appeals to all working people and their trade union organizations to take the initiative and unite to urge their governments to reach an agreement without delay on halting hydrogen bomb tests and banning the use of weapons of mass destruction, if these governments have not already done so.

It urges the major powers to hold a summit meeting to discuss the issue of stopping the arms race of lethal weapons that endanger humanity. (Xinhua News Agency)

    世界工联号召全世界工人展开斗争
    据波兰通讯社报道，世界工会联合会书记处最近通过了一项呼吁书，号召全世界的工会会员展开争取停止核武器试验的斗争。
    呼吁书指出，核军备竞赛和不断的氢弹试验危及人类并且引起人民的深切不安。这种不安已经由于北大西洋集团军队要装备原子核武器的决定而加剧了。
    世界工会联合会重申它1954年4月29日的反对试验和使用这些武器的宣言，并且认为这条道路上的第一步应当是大国之间缔结一项协定，结束核试验。
    世界工会联合会最后庄严地呼请全体劳动人民和他们的工会组织采取主动并团结起来促使他们政府毫不迟延地达成关于制止氢弹试验和禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的协议，如果这些政府现在还没有这样做的话。
    敦劝各大国举行最高级会议讨论停止进行危及人类的致命武器的军备竞赛问题。（新华社）
