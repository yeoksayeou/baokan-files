Let the People Speak Their Minds
              Fan Huanong
    Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and the Central Committee's policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" are truly guiding lights for the new era. Over the past two months, the political life of our country has become active, vibrant, and full of the loveliness of spring, an unprecedented grand occasion. As an intellectual, I can't help but feel elated; I also have some heartfelt feelings that I am eager to express.

   "Broadening avenues for speech and speaking freely" seems to be one of the keys to handling contradictions among the people and implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. But putting it into practice is not easy. Recently, after carefully reading the newspapers, I have a general feeling that "there are many concerns that prevent open expression; walls need to be torn down, and ditches need to be filled." Therefore, I feel that "to let the people speak their minds," we must add one more condition: "No taboos," which is the only task at present.

    Why are people so worried? Why do people feel there is a wall and a ditch? Why don't people always speak from the heart? Let me share some of my experiences over the past few years, and let the readers judge whether they are heartfelt words.

    First, fear of being labeled is the most common concern. In recent years, there has indeed been a trend in society: too many labels. The newspapers have exposed a lot of this in the past few days. I will only give one example of how this trend has penetrated the countryside: I have a very honest relative (a small clerk) who returned to his hometown and had a drink with a rich peasant element (who had long been de-labeled and become an honest commune member). The village's Party organization actually wrote a letter to his work unit saying that he was "backward," which scared him so much that he dared not return to his hometown. Later, after investigation, it was proved that the report was not accurate.

    Second, fear of not being comprehensive. It is right to require a comprehensive viewpoint when speaking, writing articles, or making suggestions. But there seems to be a social atmosphere of "demanding perfection," which has gradually fostered a set pattern for speaking, writing articles, and making suggestions: "Achievements are fundamental, shortcomings exist..." If it doesn't fit the pattern, it's not comprehensive enough, the words are not listened to, the articles are not published, and the suggestions are not valued. A few years ago, I wrote a petition in Beijing, loudly calling for the abolition of the supply system and the implementation of a wage system. I sent it to several senior cadres, and their response seemed to imply that it was not comprehensive enough. I felt a chill, so I dared not submit it further. Later, the central government decided to fully implement the wage system. I was both happy and ashamed of my lack of courage, but at the same time, I felt the terror of the social atmosphere. As recently as last July, in response to the call for "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," I wrote a short article of one thousand words titled "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend and Improving the Atmosphere," the purpose of which was to oppose "authoritarian thinking" and "stereotyped writing." I submitted it to several places, naturally first to the People's Daily, but the result was probably that it didn't fit the pattern, and it was returned. Here, I can't help but recall the era of the democratic movement in coordination with the War of Liberation. I also served as an active contributor, and I can't help but feel a little sentimental. Have my ideas become outdated? I really don't dare to write. I very much agree with the saying: "Talking about only one aspect is not necessarily one-sided; listing all aspects is not necessarily comprehensive."

    Third, fear of not being attuned to the times. The saying "He who understands the times is a great man" is understood by some as "trimming one's sails to the wind," which I think is really harmful. Ma Yinlao said with emotion: What makes people most angry is that there are some people who trim their sails to the wind, acting according to the faces of the Communist Party members (paraphrased). We cannot but admit that there are such people in society, and we cannot but admit that some Communist Party members do indeed like such people. The ancient Chinese saying "A thousand men saying yes is not as good as one scholar's frank criticism" is something I think we should embrace both types of people. But over the past eight years, I have seen quite a few instances where, in certain occasions, too much emphasis has been placed on reusing those who say "yes" and neglecting those who offer candid criticism.

    Fourth, fear of no response. We do not oppose respecting well-known figures and representatives, and we do not oppose attaching importance to their opinions and articles. But we oppose the attitude of not responding to the opinions and articles of unknown people. We have seen some articles in newspapers and periodicals that are really empty and meaningless, but because they are well-known, they are bound to be published. The emergence of new writers is not frequent enough, and I am afraid this is also related to this trend. We have also seen some leading personnel of the People's Government who have a style of not responding to the opinions of the masses. I myself have encountered this more than once. For example, based on my years of work experience, I spent a year writing a report on "Improving the Work Efficiency of Government Organs" and sent it to the former Secretary-General of the Government Administration Council. According to my idea, receiving a reply like this: "Your opinion is very good in spirit and has been kept for reference," is probably what I expected. The fact is that there was no response. How can people not feel a little uncomfortable?

    Fifth, fear of saying that some Party members are not good to the Communist Party. I think this is a wall and a ditch between the masses and the Party members. Everyone recognizes that the vast majority of Party members are good. Everyone also knows that Communist Party members are made of special materials. The eight conditions for Party members are so strict. How difficult it is for us to strive to join the Party. How dare we say that Party members are not good? Although I have personally seen that individual Party members and a few Party members do indeed have bad work styles, and some even have qualities that are not good enough, and sometimes the leadership also acknowledges these situations, but in front of the leadership, in front of the masses, I dare not say that this Party member is not good, that Party member is not good, so I can only mumble vaguely. Some don't even dare to mumble. Only when Party member leaders criticize these Party members, do they applaud and cheer in their hearts. I think this kind of psychology exists from non-Party general cadres to non-Party leading cadres. For example, if you see some Party members "squatting in the latrine without shitting" (meaning they are too incompetent), some Party members' brains are indeed rusty, and some Party members insist on pretending to be experts when they are not, according to your intention, it is best to have a fit. But when you think that you are not even a Party member yet, it is better to be wise and protect yourself. As for myself, I am considered to be a bolder type, and I sometimes dare to criticize Party member cadres (naturally, I dare to criticize non-Party cadres even more), but the feedback I receive is that why am I always making things difficult for Party members? A light word, how chilling. Fortunately, I can withstand the test and have not been frightened. But after all, there is still a feeling of walls and ditches. Naturally, to tear down the wall and fill the ditch is the responsibility of both Party members and the masses. But my opinion is that Party members should be more proactive.

    让人民把心里的话都讲出来
              范华农
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话和中央关于开展“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，实在是新时期的指路明灯。两个月来，我们国家的政治生活显得活跃起来，生气勃勃，春意可爱，盛况空前。我也是一个知识分子，不觉心花怒放；也有一些骨鲠在喉的感想，大有一吐为快的感觉。
   “广开言路，畅所欲言”，看来已是处理人民内部矛盾和贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的关键之一。但是实行起来，也着实不容易。近来细细翻读报纸，有一总的感觉，便是“顾虑很多敞不开，墙要推倒沟要平”。因此，我觉得“要让人民把心里的话都讲出来”，还得加一条：“百无禁忌”，是当前唯一的任务。
    为什么人们的顾虑那末多？为什么使人们感到有道墙有条沟？为什么讲的不都是心里话？就我几年来的体会说一些，请读者鉴定鉴定是不是心里话？
    一、怕扣帽子，这是最普通的一种顾虑。近年来社会上确有一种风气：帽子太多。这几天报纸上揭露得很多了。我只举一件这种风气深入农村的例子：我有一个为人十分老实的亲戚（小职员）回到家乡和一个富农分子（现早已摘掉帽子，成为老实社员）喝了一次酒，这个乡村的党组织居然写了信反映给他的机关说他“落后”，吓得他不敢回家乡。后来经过调查，证明反映的并不确实。
    二、怕不全面。说话、写文章、提意见，要求有全面观点是对的。但似乎有一种“求全责备”的社会风气，渐渐养成了说话、写文章、提意见有一套模子：“成绩是基本的，缺点是存在的……”，不合模子便是不够全面，说的话不愿听，写的文章无处发表，提的意见不受重视。前几年我在北京写了一个意见书，大声疾呼建议取消供给制实行工资制，送给几个高级干部看，回答我的态度似乎嫌不全面，我感觉有些凉意，便也不敢往上拿了。后来中央决定全面实行了工资制，我一面高兴，一面惭愧自己勇气不够，但同时也感到社会风气的可怕。还在去年7月，我为了响应“百家争鸣”的号召，写了一篇“百家争鸣与改善风气”一千字的短文，宗旨是反对“权威思想”与“八股作风”，数处投稿，自然首先是投人民日报，结果大概是不对模子，都退了回来。在这里不能不回想当年民主运动配合解放战争的时代，我也忝为一个积极的撰稿人，不免有些伤感，是不是自己思想落伍了呢？实有不敢动笔之感。我很同意这样的说法：“只谈一面未必片面，面面罗列也未必全面”。
    三、怕不识时务。“识时务者为俊杰”这句话被人理解为“看风使舵”，我认为实在害人不浅。马寅老慨乎言之：最使人生气的有那么一种人，他们见风使舵，看着共产党员的脸色行事（大意）。我们不能不承认社会上有那么一种人，也不能不承认有一些共产党员确实也喜欢那么一种人。中国古语“千人之诺诺，不如一士之谔谔”，我以为固然诺诺谔谔应该兼收并蓄，才显得国家网罗天下英才之广，但八年以来，个别场合过分重用诺诺之人，冷落谔谔之士的现象，我看到的也不在少数。
    四、怕相应不理。我们不反对尊重知名之士、代表人物，不反对重视他们的意见和文章。但是反对对无名之士的意见和文章相应不理的态度。我们曾看到报刊上有一些文章实在空洞无物，因为知名，有稿必登。新作家之出现还不够多，恐与此风也有关系。我们也曾看到人民政府有些领导人员对群众意见有相应不理的作风。我自己就碰到过不止一次，例如我曾根据几年来工作经验，花了一年工夫，写了一个“关于提高政府机关工作效率”的报告送给前政务院秘书长，按照我的想法，得到一封这样的回信：“你的意见精神很好，已留作参考”，大概是情理之中的事。事实是相应不理。怎么不令人有些不舒服。
    五、怕对共产党说有些党员不好。我认为这是群众同党员之间的一道墙和一条沟。大家公认，绝大多数的党员是好的。大家也知道，共产党员是特殊材料制成的。党员八项条件何等严格。我们要争取入党又是何等艰巨。怎么敢说党员不好？虽然亲眼看到个别党员和少数党员确实作风不好，有的甚至品质也不够好，有时领导上也承认这些情况，但是在领导面前，在群众面前，无论如何也不敢说这个党员不好，那个党员不好，只好含含糊糊，嘀咕一番而已，有的连嘀咕也不敢。只有在党员领导干部批评这些党员的时候，内心作鼓掌称快的活动。这种心理，从非党一般干部到非党领导干部，我想都有。譬如，你看到有的党员“蹬了毛厕不拉屎”（太不称职之意），有的党员确实脑子生了锈，有的党员外行偏要充内行，照你的意思最好要发作一番，但是一想你还不够一个党员呢，还是明哲保身为妙。论我自己，还算胆子大的一类，有时也敢批评批评党员干部（自然对非党干部批评的胆子更要大些），但是反映传来，说我为什么专与党员为难？轻轻一语，好不令人毛骨悚然。幸而我还经得起考验，没有吓倒。但是终究还有些墙沟之感。自然，要推倒墙、填平沟，是党员和群众双方的责任。但我的意见希望党员更要主动些。
