Ideological and Political Work in Scientific Research Institutions 田夫

The basic task of scientific research institutions is to conduct scientific research and serve the country's socialist construction with scientific research results. The ideological and political work of the Party organizations in scientific research institutions is to encourage scientific research personnel to engage in creative mental work and ensure the smooth development of scientific research work. The main masses in scientific research institutions are scientific research personnel, and the Party's main reliance in scientific research work is on scientists. The Party's mass line in scientific research work mainly involves consulting with scientists on matters and listening to their opinions with an open mind.

The vast majority of scientists in our country love the motherland and science. Especially since the national liberation, under the encouragement of the Party's policies and the great achievements of the country's construction, they have made tremendous progress. Politically, they actively support the Communist Party and socialism; in their work, they work diligently, hoping to quickly produce results to serve socialist construction. However, we must not fail to see that they are almost all from non-proletarian families, have been educated under capitalism for a long time, and to varying degrees, carry old social habits and bourgeois individualism and idealist thinking. Patiently and meticulously helping them carry out self-transformation is an important political task of Party organizations in scientific research institutions.

Ideological and political work in scientific research institutions should mainly start from the following aspects:

Conducting ideological and political work in daily scientific activities

Conduct ideological and political work in daily scientific activities. The Party organization should conscientiously study the guidelines for scientific research work and understand the content of scientific research work; according to the general guidelines, tasks, and the specific circumstances of the discipline, assist scientists in formulating scientific research work plans. When formulating plans, mobilize scientists for full discussion. The result of doing so is not only concentrating the experience and wisdom of the masses, making the plan more practical, but also the process of formulating the plan is also a process of ideological education for scientists. Through this work, scientists will broaden their horizons, establish a global perspective, understand the connection between this discipline and other disciplines, and understand how scientific research work serves socialist construction. When the Chinese Academy of Sciences began to formulate research plans, some scientists believed that scientific research work could not be planned and therefore did not approve of planning; or although they reluctantly made plans, they did not value them ideologically. In response to this situation, the Party organization carried out patient persuasion work; tried to understand the value of scientists' research topics, and provided support in all aspects for the most valuable research topics, so that they consciously incorporated their small plans into the big plans of the discipline. For young scientific workers, the main thing is to educate them not to be impatient in scientific research work. Make them realize that scientific research results cannot be easily obtained; they must be obtained through long-term, arduous, and creative labor. Require them to develop the habit of proceeding gradually from the beginning of their work.

In order to consolidate the professional thinking of scientific administrative personnel and auxiliary personnel, the Party organization invited them to visit laboratories and invited scientists to give reports, so that they could understand that scientific administrative work is an indispensable part of scientific research work, and that every scientific research result contains their own labor. This overcomes their erroneous ideas that their work is "serving people," "unpromising," and "without a future." For example, the auxiliary personnel of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology said: "Washing stones and making fossils every day is very boring." However, after Yang Zhongjian, director of the institute, gave a report on how paleontology serves socialist construction, they understood that studying vertebrate paleontology would allow people to judge whether there are minerals in the strata based on fossils, and how much the mineral reserves are. This kind of work is indeed of great significance to socialist construction, thus overcoming the idea of not being at ease with their work.

The Party organization should also be good at carrying out work through the Academic Committee. The Party's influence on the Academic Committee is mainly realized through Party members. The Party requires Party members participating in the Academic Committee not only to work actively themselves, but more importantly, to mobilize and encourage non-Party scientists to work actively. On academic issues, Party members are required to adopt a clear attitude, free thought, and free debate, and discuss issues in the spirit of correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism, adhering to the truth, and correcting mistakes; oppose the liberalist attitude of taking ambiguous, compromising, or not daring to expose one's own views on academic issues; and also oppose rude attitudes in academic debates. Only in this way can the Academic Committee become a powerful leading body for leading scientific research, implementing scientific policies, and carrying out academic criticism.

Publicizing and implementing the Party's various policies on scientific work

Publicizing and implementing the Party's various policies on scientific work, especially the Party's policies on uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. Only with the correct implementation of the policy towards intellectuals can scientists be encouraged to work with confidence and give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in scientific research work, so as to better serve the country's socialist construction. Only when the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy is accepted by scientists can they boldly create, freely carry out debates and criticisms.

In the process of implementing policies, the Party organization first educates Party and League members to become models of consciously publicizing and implementing policies. The exemplary actions of Party and League members are the most powerful tool for mobilizing the masses to implement the Party's policies. Party and League members' correct implementation of the Party's policies is also a learning process from blindness to consciousness. In the initial stage of implementing the Party's policy of uniting scientists, Party and League members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences all admitted that the Party's policy of uniting scientists was correct, but some Party and League members could not understand it when they came into contact with specific problems. Some Party and League members even said: "Uniting scientists is the Party's concession to scientists." Later, after repeated education by the Party organization, everyone understood the importance of the Party's policy of uniting scientists and the possibility of realizing this policy, and everyone consciously implemented the Party's policy.

Secondly, the Party organization must also regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of policies by Party and League members, commend the good ones, and give appropriate education and criticism to the bad ones. Because after being educated by the Party organization, Party and League members have a more comprehensive understanding of the Party's policies, but in actual work, many problems will still occur. For example, when the Chinese Academy of Sciences began to implement the policy of uniting scientists, a kind of "left" sentiment was encountered. Some Party and League members were harsh in their attitude of helping scientists, and there were even rude phenomena in individual research institutes. However, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's conference on the issue of intellectuals, a rightist sentiment appeared, and more attention was paid to the care of scientists in their lives than to the help in their work and thinking. Individual Party and League members adopted an attitude of "respect and distance" towards scientists. Scientists criticized us for "excessive care and insufficient help."

Finally, whether the Party's policies can be correctly implemented must also rely on the consciousness of the masses. For example, the implementation of the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, only when intellectuals have a comprehensive and correct understanding of themselves, seeing both their positive side and their negative side, can they consciously demand self-transformation.

Organizing scientists to participate in practical struggles

Party organizations in scientific institutions should help scientific researchers directly contact the great struggles of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The Party organization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has attracted and encouraged scientific researchers to participate in various social reform movements. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, we aimed at the characteristic that scientists generally love scientific undertakings, and used specific examples of how counter-revolutionary elements sabotage scientific research work to inspire scientists' patriotism and hatred for counter-revolutionary elements, and strive for their conscious participation in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries struggle; and absorbed a part of scientists to participate in the leadership work of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This not only improved scientists' political consciousness, drew a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and criticized their own non-political tendencies, but also played a positive role in distinguishing counter-revolutionary elements hidden in scientific research institutions and promoting the smooth development of the movement.

In order to enable scientists to frequently contact social practical life, the Party organization and the trade union of the Academy of Sciences also organized scientists to visit factories, cooperatives, and new buildings; and invited government cadres and model workers to make reports on the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and agricultural cooperation. Scientists reflected that they benefited greatly. We often encourage scientists to go deep into the masses, contact the masses, especially to help scientists who are responsible for leadership establish a work style of close contact with the masses, and rely on the masses to do a good job of leadership. On the one hand, help them establish leadership prestige among the masses, on the other hand, enable them to be educated among the masses.

Guiding scientific research personnel to study Marxism-Leninism

Organizing and guiding scientific research personnel to study Marxist-Leninist theory is one of the important tasks of Party organizations in scientific institutions. Scientific research personnel studying Marxism-Leninism should generally first study Marxist-Leninist philosophy, because philosophy is the theoretical basis of all sciences, and is the ideological weapon for guiding and promoting the continuous advancement of all sciences. In addition to reading Marxist-Leninist classics, the content of study should also include some Marxist treatises on clarifying the nature and role of science. Such as "Science is a kind of ideology," "Science and Life," "Dialectical Materialism and Modern Physics," and so on. Studying these things can help scientific research personnel theoretically understand the objects, tasks, and basic methods of researching science; understand the relationship between science and philosophy, science and production practice, and social practice. Only when scientists have a general understanding of the overall picture and status of science can they appropriately understand the status and role of their discipline in the entire field of science, and further grasp the general laws of the development of their discipline, and further clarify the current guidelines and tasks of scientific research in their discipline. These are of great guiding significance to the scientific activities of a scientific worker.

In terms of learning methods, self-study should be the main method, and the principle of "theory linked to practice" should be implemented, inspiring them to link to the reality of their work and their own thinking, and paying attention to summarizing and exchanging experiences in this regard. After studying dialectical materialism, some scientific researchers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences consciously began to use dialectical materialism's viewpoints and methods to examine and guide their research work. For example, the Cotton Aphid Research Office of the Institute of Entomology, under the leadership of scientist Zhu Hongfu, conducted research on the growth and decline of cotton aphids in cotton fields, hoping to find out the reasons for the growth and decline of cotton aphids through this research, in order to achieve the purpose of prediction, forecasting, and prevention. In the past few years of research, they only concluded that climate is the main reason for the growth and decline of cotton aphids, and did not completely solve the problem. However, after they studied dialectical materialism, they comprehensively studied the relationship between climate and rainfall, beneficial insects, cotton growth stages, and the life characteristics of cotton aphids and the growth and decline of cotton aphids, and found out the law of the growth and decline of cotton aphids, and wrote the "Cotton Aphid Prediction and Forecasting Method." This method has now been promoted and has played a great role in preventing and controlling cotton aphids. In terms of linking to the reality of thinking, after improving their understanding by learning theory, many scientists have tried to criticize their individualism, subjectivism, and idealistic thinking in academics, and paid attention to correcting them in their actual work. In this way, scientists gradually gained a correct understanding of the Party and communism, and were able to effectively carry out scientific research work.

When carrying out ideological and political work, the Party organization should also be good at giving play to the role of the Youth League, the trade union, and the various democratic parties, so that the Party, the League, the trade union, and the democratic parties, under the unified leadership of the Party, coordinate their steps, divide their labor, and cooperate, so that scientific research personnel can be educated in all aspects.

Through the above series of ideological and political work, the socialist consciousness of scientific research personnel in the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been significantly improved, they have experienced the Party's concern for scientific undertakings and its importance to them, and they have seen the important role of scientific undertakings in socialist construction, thereby setting off a upsurge of marching towards science in the entire academy.

However, our ideological and political work is still far behind the objective reality. This work has not received enough attention from all Party and League members. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that ideological and political work is the soul of all work. We should actively strengthen the ideological and political work of scientific institutions to ensure the smooth development of scientific research undertakings.

    科学研究机关中的思想政治工作	　田夫
    科学研究机关的基本任务是进行科学研究，以科学研究成果服务于祖国社会主义建设。科学研究机关党组织的思想政治工作，就是要鼓励科学研究人员从事创造性的脑力劳动，保证科学研究工作的顺利开展。科学研究机关的主要群众是科学研究人员，党在科学研究工作中的主要依靠力量是科学家。党在科学研究工作中的群众路线，主要是遇事同科学家商量，虚心地听取科学家的意见。
    我国的科学家，绝大多数是爱祖国、爱科学的，特别是当全国解放以后，在党的政策和祖国建设伟大成就的鼓舞下，他们更加有了巨大进步。在政治上，他们积极拥护共产党和社会主义；在工作上，都是勤勤恳恳地劳动着，愿尽快地研究出成果，服务于社会主义建设。但是，我们不能不看到，他们几乎都是非无产阶级家庭出身的，长期受资本主义的教育，在不同程度上，带有旧社会习气和资产阶级个人主义和唯心主义思想。耐心细致地帮助他们进行自我改造，乃是科学研究机关党组织的重要政治任务。
    在科学研究机关中进行思想政治工作，主要应从以下几个方面着手：
    在日常科学活动中进行思想政治工作
    在日常的科学活动中进行思想政治工作。党组织要认真研究科学研究工作的方针，了解科学研究工作的内容；根据总的方针任务和本门科学的具体情况，协助科学家制订科学研究工作计划。在制订计划时，发动科学家进行充分讨论。这样做的结果，不仅集中了群众的经验和智慧，使计划订得更切合实际；同时，制定计划的过程，也是对科学家进行思想教育的过程。通过这一工作，会使科学家扩大眼界，树立全局观点，了解本门学科同其它学科的联系，了解科学研究工作如何为社会主义建设服务。中国科学院开始制定研究计划的时候，有的科学家认为科学研究工作不能定计划，因而不赞成定；或者虽然勉强定了但思想上并不重视。党组织针对这种情况，进行了耐心的说服工作；设法了解科学家研究题目的价值，对其中最有价值的研究题目，从各方面给予支持，使他们自觉地把自己的小计划纳入本门学科的大计划之内。对于青年科学工作者，主要应教育他们在科学研究工作中不要有急躁情绪。使他们认识到科学研究成果不是可以轻易得到的；必须经过长期艰苦创造性的劳动才能取得。要求他们一开始工作就要养成循序渐进的习惯。
    为了巩固科学机关行政人员和辅助人员的专业思想，党组织请他们参观了实验室，请科学家作报告，使他们了解科学行政工作是科学研究工作中不可缺少的一部分，每一项科学研究成果都包含着自己的劳动在内。从而克服了他们认为自己的工作是“侍候人”、“没出息”、“没前途”等错误思想。如古脊椎动物研究室的辅助人员说：“每天洗石头打化石，这样工作很无味道。”但当该室杨钟健主任作了关于古生物学如何为社会主义建设服务的报告以后，他们懂得了研究古脊椎动物，就会使人们根据化石来判断地层中有无矿产，矿产的蕴藏量有多少。这种工作对社会主义建设确实是有很大意义的，因而克服了不安心工作的思想。
    党组织还应当善于通过学术委员会进行工作。党对学术委员会的影响，主要是通过党员来实现的。党要求参加学术委员会的党员，不仅自己积极工作，而更重要的是动员与鼓励非党科学家积极工作。对学术问题，要求党员采取明朗态度，自由思想，自由辩论，本着正确开展批评与自我批评、坚持真理、修正错误的精神去讨论问题；反对在学术问题上采取模棱两可、折衷调和或不敢暴露自己见解的自由主义态度；也反对在学术问题争论中的粗暴态度。只有这样，才能使学术委员会成为领导科学研究，贯彻科学政策，开展学术批评的强有力的领导机构。
    宣传与贯彻党对科学工作的各项政策
    宣传与贯彻党对科学工作的各项政策，特别是党对知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策，以及“百家争鸣”的方针。只有知识分子政策的正确贯彻，才能鼓舞科学家满怀信心地工作，才能发挥他们在科学研究工作上的积极性和创造性，更好地为国家社会主义建设服务。只有“百家争鸣”方针被科学家所接受，才能使他们大胆创造，自由地开展争论和批评。
    党组织在贯彻政策过程中，首先是教育党、团员成为自觉宣传和执行政策的模范。党、团员的模范行动，就是动员群众去执行党的政策的最有力的工具。党、团员正确地执行党的政策，也是一个从盲目到自觉的学习过程。中国科学院在贯彻党的团结科学家政策的初期，党、团员都承认党团结科学家的政策是正确的，但有些党、团员一接触到具体问题时就搞不通了。甚至有的党、团员说：“团结科学家是党对科学家的迁就”。后来经过党组织的反复教育，使大家了解了党的团结科学家政策的重要性和实现这个政策的可能性，大家才较为自觉地执行党的这个政策。
    其次，党组织还必须经常监督和检查党、团员执行政策的情况，对好的予以表扬，对坏的给予适当的教育和批评。因为经过党组织的教育，党、团员对党的政策虽然有了较全面的认识，但在实际工作中，还会发生许多问题。如中国科学院在开始执行团结科学家政策时，就碰到了一种“左”的情绪。有些党、团员对科学家的帮助态度生硬，甚至个别研究所还有粗暴现象。但在中共中央知识分子问题会议以后，又出现了一种右的情绪，对科学家生活上的照顾多于工作上、思想上的帮助。个别党、团员对科学家抱“敬而远之”的态度。科学家批评我们是“照顾有余，帮助不足”。
    最后，党的政策能否正确贯彻，还必须依靠群众的自觉性。例如对团结、教育、改造知识分子政策的贯彻，只有当知识分子对自己有了全面正确的认识，既看到了自己积极的一面，同时也看到了自己的消极的一面，他们才能自觉地要求进行自我改造。
    组织科学家参加实际斗争
    科学机关的党组织应该帮助科学研究人员直接接触社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大斗争。中国科学院党组织，在历次社会改革运动中，都吸引和鼓励科学研究人员参加。在肃反运动中，我们针对一般科学家都热爱科学事业的特点，用反革命分子如何破坏科学研究工作的具体事例，来启发科学家的爱国心和对反革命分子的仇恨心，争取他们自觉地参加了肃反斗争；并吸收了一部分科学家参加肃反的领导工作。这样做不但提高了科学家的政治觉悟，划清了敌我界限，批判了自己非政治倾向，而且对辨别暗藏在科学研究机关中的反革命分子和推动运动的顺利发展，都起了积极作用。
    为使科学家经常接触社会实际生活，科学院党组织和工会，还组织科学家参观工厂、合作社和新建筑物；请政府干部、劳动模范作关于和平改造资本主义工商业和农业合作化等报告。科学家反映收益很大。我们经常鼓励科学家深入群众、联系群众，特别是帮助负有领导责任的科学家树立起密切联系群众的工作作风，依靠群众做好领导工作。一方面帮助他们在群众中建立起领导威信，另一方面使他们在群众中也得到教育。
    指导科学研究人员学习马列主义
    组织与指导科学研究人员进行马克思列宁主义理论学习，是科学机关党组织的重要任务之一。科学研究人员学习马克思列宁主义，一般应先学习马克思列宁主义哲学，因为哲学是各门科学的理论基础，是指导和推动各门科学不断前进的思想武器。学习的内容，除阅读马克思列宁主义经典著作外，还应选读一些关于阐明科学的性质、作用等有关马克思主义的论著。如“科学是一种思想意识形态”、“科学与生活”、“辩证唯物主义和现代物理学”等等。学习这些东西，可以帮助科学研究人员从理论上认识科学的对象、任务，以及研究科学的基本方法；了解科学和哲学，科学和生产实践、社会实践的关系。科学家也只有对科学的总面目和地位有了概括的了解，才有可能恰当地认识本门学科在整个科学领域中的地位和作用，才有可能进一步掌握本门科学发展的一般规律性，并进一步明确本门科学研究的当前方针和任务。这些，对于一个科学工作者的科学活动是有很大指导意义的。
    在学习方法上，应以自学为主，贯彻“理论联系实际”的方针，启发他们联系工作实际和思想实际，并注意总结与交流这方面的经验。中国科学院科学研究人员学完辩证唯物主义后，有些人就有意识地开始运用辩证唯物主义的观点、方法来检查与指导自己的研究工作。如昆虫研究所棉虫研究室，在科学家朱弘复先生领导下进行棉蚜在棉田中消长的研究，想通过这个研究找出棉蚜消长的原因，以达到预测预报和防治的目的。在过去几年的研究中，他们仅总结出气候是棉蚜消长的主要原因，并没有彻底解决问题。但当他们学过辩证唯物主义以后，就把气候跟雨量、益虫、棉花生长阶段以及棉蚜生活特点等因素和棉蚜消长的关系联系起来全面研究，找出了棉蚜消长的规律，写出了“棉蚜预测预报办法”。这办法现已推广，对防治棉蚜起了很大作用。在联系思想实际方面，不少科学家在学习理论提高认识以后，曾尝试批判自己的个人主义、主观主义和学术上的唯心主义思想，并注意在实际工作中改正。这样，科学家就逐渐对党、对共产主义有了正确的理解，并能有成效地进行科学研究工作。
    党组织在进行思想政治工作时，还应当善于发挥青年团、工会和各民主党派的作用，使党、团、工会和民主党派在党的统一领导下，齐一步调分工协作，以便使科学研究人员从各方面受到教育。
    中国科学院，通过以上一系列的思想政治工作，科学研究人员的社会主义觉悟水平有了显著提高，体验到党对科学事业的关怀和对自己的器重，看到科学事业在社会主义建设中的重大作用，从而在全院掀起了向科学进军的热潮。
    但是，我们的思想政治工作，还远远地落后于客观实际。这一工作，还没有引起全体党、团员足够的重视。毛泽东同志教导我们说，思想政治工作，是各项工作的灵魂。我们应当积极加强科学机关的思想政治工作，保证科学研究事业的顺利发展。
