Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th: According to "Lao Fighting Forces News," Lao Vice-King Phetsarath recently emphasized once again the necessity of cooperation between the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Forces. He said that division would only harm the interests of the Lao nation, therefore, "despite the obstruction of foreigners and their pawns, both sides must reconcile."

At this mass rally, Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, welcomed Phetsarath's visit on behalf of the Lao Fighting Forces. In his speech, Souphanouvong condemned the United States and its accomplices for attempting to undermine Laos' policy of peace and neutrality and transform Laos into a U.S. colony and military base.

Souphanouvong reiterated the Lao Fighting Forces' support for the Phouma government, expressed the hope that the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Forces would strengthen cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual concession, and emphasized that the establishment of a coalition government with the participation of the Lao Fighting Forces is the main issue that should be promoted and resolved at present.

Phetsarath also met with reporters during his visit to Sam Neua. In response to reporters' questions, he said that only a policy of peace and neutrality is suitable for Laos.

Phetsarath said that he hoped a coalition government could be formed in the near future in order to realize this policy of peace and neutrality, because this policy would bring happiness and tranquility to the people. He said that the urgent desire of the people everywhere is to ask me to help bring about a rapid peace and tranquility to their homeland.

When talking about his views on the Lao Fighting Forces, Phetsarath said, although my visit to Sam Neua was very short, I feel that the soldiers of the Lao Fighting Forces are very disciplined, close to the people, and loved by the people.

He also said that he was very happy to see with his own eyes that some of the villages in Sam Neua have greatly changed from the past, and that everywhere people are actively rebuilding their homes destroyed by the war.

    苏发努冯重申寮国战斗部队拥护富马政府，希望老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队加强在平等、互让原则基础上的合作，并且强调成立有寮国战斗部队参加的联合政府是当前应当促进和解决的主要问题。
    佩差拉在桑怒访问期间还接见了记者。他在回答记者问题时说，只有和平中立政策才适用于老挝。
    佩差拉说，他希望在最近期间能成立联合政府，以期实现这种和平中立的政策，因为这种政策会给人民带来幸福和安宁。他说，所有各地的人民的迫切愿望是要求我帮助促使家园迅速得到和平和安宁。
    佩差拉在谈到对寮国战斗部队的看法的时候说，我到桑怒参观的时间虽然很短，但是我觉得寮国战斗部队的战士很遵守纪律，接近人民并且得到人民的爱戴。
