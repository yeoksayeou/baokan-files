Street Talk

    "Street Talk," as the name suggests, is a casual chat among ordinary people. There are no lengthy dissertations here, nor elaborate creations, just neighbors chatting about public affairs and sharing everyday life. When there's something to say, it's long; when there's nothing to say, it's short.

    We would like to learn from the ancient spirit of "collecting folk songs" and dedicate this space to our readers. -- Editor

    Why Must They Ride Cars?

    We sure have a lot of cars these days.

    If you don't believe me, just watch the street for a little while, and you won't be able to count them all. On Sundays, go to Wangfujing Department Store or Zhongshan Park. Hey, don't even mention it. Bringing children, grandmothers, sisters-in-law, and brothers-in-law—it's like the whole family gets in the car. Blue license plates, white license plates, a long string of them. Tell me, is this reasonable? Isn't this wasting the country's gasoline?

    In the past, cars were only on the main streets, but now small alleys are full of cars coming and going all day long. Children playing ball have to be careful. Not long ago, I saw a little boy almost have his leg run over, so close!

    I don't understand, why do some comrades have to take a car to work? Using public cars to buy things and go to the park is even more outrageous. Just because you're a cadre doesn't mean you can't take the streetcar? Have these people not suffered enough in the past? Or have they gotten so used to a comfortable life that they've completely forgotten the old days?
        (A resident of Ben Si Hutong, Beijing)

    What Kind of "Rectification" is This?

    The Communist Party is going to conduct a rectification campaign. I think some Party members really need to be rectified. We are all elderly people and are willing to get close to Party members, but some Party members are unwilling to get close to us, thinking we have shit on us. We are called objects of the united front, and we are willing to be united by Party members, but they don't come to unite us. Old Party members treat us perfunctorily, and new Party members murmur about us. Is this what you call sincere interaction? In the old society, we were people who struggled to make a living. Today, we want to do some work that is beneficial to the people, but we can't get involved. The Party's good methods are not followed by Party members. I think the "rectification" that needs to be done is right here.
    (A non-Party member in Hohhot)

    Between Cadre and Nanny

    The relationship between some cadres and nannies is very bad nowadays. In the family I work for, there are a husband and wife and three children. Every day, besides taking care of the children, buying groceries, cooking three meals, cleaning the rooms, and washing clothes for four or five people, there are many other chores. I get up at six in the morning and don't go to bed until eleven at night. I hardly have any rest. But the cadre comrades still think I don't work enough, nitpicking in every way, and don't support my request to participate in cultural studies. If the children get sick, they say I don't take good care of them. If I need to buy coal, oil, or soap, they say I'm not thrifty. It's really unfair! They always complain behind our backs that this nanny is naughty and that nanny is not honest, and they even groundlessly suspect us of pocketing money when buying groceries, saying, "There isn't a nanny who doesn't skim!" Tell me, isn't that infuriating?
          (Wang Yueying, Tianqiao, Beijing)

    Model Worker

    Model worker, model worker,
    Good things are often full of setbacks,
    From the county to the province,
    Busy and exhausted;
    Thirty days in a month,
    Not sitting down for twenty-nine.
        (He Zhongqi, Tongcheng, Hubei)

    Argument Between Husband and Wife

    Husband: The farm work is tight now, why don't you go back home to participate in production!
    Wife: You say it so nicely, why don't you go back home to participate in production?
    Husband: If you go back home to participate in production, I'll send you money every month, isn't that the same?
    Wife: I don't want to go back home, I have to cook and also participate in production, and I can't stand my family.
    Husband: I often have to leave for work, it's inconvenient for you to stay in the office, and if you don't do some work in the agricultural cooperative, we'll have difficulties next year.
    Wife: Oh, now you want me to go home? Wasn't it you who said life in the city was good and wanted me to come?
          (Li Baojin, Suining, Jiangsu)

### 街谈巷议

专栏：街谈巷议

    街谈巷议
    “街谈巷议”，顾名思义是一些普通人的随便谈心。这里没有长篇大论，也不是精心巨制，只是左邻右舍大家谈谈公益事，话个家常。有话即长，无话即短。
    我们很想学习古代“采风”的精神，将这一块篇幅贡献于读者之前。　——编者
    为什么非坐小汽车不可？
    现在咱们的小汽车可真多。
    您不信到街上瞧那么一会，包您数也数不过来。星期天上王府井百货大楼或是中山公园。嘿，就甭提了。拖儿带女，老太太、大姨子、小舅子，赶情一大家全坐上汽车来啦。蓝牌的，白牌的，一望一大串。您说，这像话吗？这不是蹧蹋国家汽油吗？
    往年，小汽车只是大街上，现在小胡同里也整天有小汽车来来去去了。小孩儿踢球玩儿什么的，净得留神。前不久我就亲眼瞧见一个小小子差点给轧断腿，多悬！
    我不明白，为什么有些同志非坐小汽车上班不可？坐公家小汽车买东西、逛公园更是胡来。当了干部就不兴搭电车了？这些人莫非以前没吃过多大苦？还是，舒服日子过惯了，就把往年日子全给忘了？
        （北京本司胡同一居民）
    整什么“风”？
    共产党要整风了。我看，有些党员真需要整一整。我们都是些年迈的人，也愿意接近党员，可是有些党员硬是不愿接近我们，认为我们身上有屎。我们被称为统一战线的对象，也愿意叫党员统一下，可是他们不来统。老党员对我们应付应付，新党员对我们嘀嘀咕咕，这难道叫真诚相见吗？在旧社会我们是混饭吃的人，今天，我们想做些有益于人民的工作，可是插不上手。党的好办法，党员不照办，我认为要整的“风”就在这里。
    （呼和浩特一个非党团人士）
    干部和保姆之间
    现在有的干部和保姆关系很不好。我工作的那家，夫妇两口子，还有三个小孩，我每天除了看管小孩、买菜、做三顿饭、打扫房间、洗四、五个人的衣服外，还有很多杂事。早晨六点起身，一直要到晚上十一点才睡觉，简直没有什么休息。但是干部同志还认为我工作不多，百般挑剔，对我要求参加文化学习也不支持。如小孩生病了，说我照顾不好，要买煤买油买肥皂，就说是我不节省，真不平等！他们在背后老扯这个保姆调皮，那个保姆不老实，还毫无根据地怀疑我们买菜扣钱，说什么“作保姆的还有不揩油！”你说气人不气人？
          （北京天桥王月英）
    劳模
    劳模劳模，
    好事多磨，
    县里省里，
    劳碌奔波；
    一月三十天，
    二十九天不落座。
        （湖北通城何中奇）
    夫妻口角
    男：目前农活紧张，你回家参加生产吧！
    女：你说得倒好听，你怎么不回家参加生产？
    男：你回家参加生产，我每月寄给你钱，不是一样吗？
    女：我不回家去，在家要做饭，又要生产，家里人我也看不惯。
    男：我经常出发，你留机关各方面都不方便，同时在农业社不做一部分工，明年生活也会有困难。
    女：噢，现在你要我回家了，当初不是你说城里生活好才要我来的吗？
          （江苏睢宁李保金）
