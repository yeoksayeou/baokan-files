Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: National cotton planting work has ended. In most cotton-producing areas, the cotton seedlings are already three to six inches tall. In the northeastern region, where planting has just finished, the cotton seedlings have also begun to emerge.

In the Yellow River basin, a major cotton-producing area, rainfall was timely this year, planting quality has improved, and the cotton seedlings have emerged fully and are growing strongly, a phenomenon unseen in recent years. In many cotton-producing areas of the Yangtze River basin, continuous rain before and after planting has led to widespread missing seedlings and seedling rot; seedling inspection and replanting are now underway.

Current information indicates that most provinces nationwide have not completed the national cotton planting plan this year; the sown area is less than last year. The national plan for cotton planting this year was over 91 million mu, which was already a reduction compared to last year; however, the actual sown area nationwide is only nearly 88 million mu. This is mainly because: some cotton-producing areas are low-lying and prone to flooding, resulting in very low cotton yields, and this year, these areas have switched to planting grain or other crops; some cotton-producing areas suffered disasters last year, resulting in poor cotton harvests, and farmers planted grain in cotton fields to solve the problem of food shortages; in some cotton-producing areas, cotton planting was overly concentrated in the past, and the supply of grain, feed, and firewood was not as abundant and timely as in grain-producing areas, so more grain was planted this year. In addition, excessive rainfall during the planting season in some areas has also affected the sown area.

According to Xinhua News Agency reporters, although the national cotton planting area this year is smaller than last year, it still exceeds any year before and after liberation, except for last year. At the same time, the quality of cotton fields in various places this year is better than in the past (mainly due to the reduction of cotton fields in many low-yielding areas), the national area sown with improved cotton varieties has increased by more than 15 million mu compared to last year, the number of pesticides prepared by the state for preventing and controlling cotton pests and diseases has increased by more than two times compared to last year, and many advanced cotton planting techniques have been adapted and creatively applied based on last year's practices. Cotton planting in the Yellow River basin, a major cotton-producing area, was timely and the seedlings are growing well; these are all favorable factors for cotton production this year. If the weather is normal this year, and all localities can fully utilize the above-mentioned favorable factors, strengthen field management, and overcome certain unfavorable factors (such as poor seedling growth and insufficient base fertilizer in some areas), and increase the yield per unit area, it is entirely possible for the total national cotton output this year to exceed any previous year (including the bumper year of 1955), and it may even exceed the 1957 cotton total output target.

A person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture said that there are still more than three months until the cotton harvest. In order to increase the cotton yield per unit area and strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, the following tasks must be done well during this period: (1) Prevent and control pests and diseases, and make full use of the abundant pesticides and machinery prepared by the state to avoid production reduction due to pests. According to past experience, achieving this alone can increase production by 15%-20%. To ensure that this work is done well, agricultural cooperatives in various localities must arrange funds and labor for pest control as soon as possible, and it is hoped that governments in various localities will help some agricultural cooperatives overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. (2) Increase fertilizer application. In addition to making full use of commercial fertilizers, all localities should make full use of human and animal manure and various farmyard fertilizers for topdressing. (3) Around the wheat harvest, agricultural cooperatives should rationally arrange labor to ensure that the wheat harvest, summer planting, and weeding and pest control for cotton are not delayed. (4) Strengthen late-stage cotton field management and do a good job in irrigation, drainage, late-stage cultivation, and pruning.

### 全国棉花播种工作已经结束  播种面积比去年减少　农业部号召提高单位产量

    全国棉花播种工作已经结束
    播种面积比去年减少　农业部号召提高单位产量
    新华社30日讯　全国各地的棉花播种工作已经结束。绝大部分棉区的棉苗已经长得三寸到六寸高；刚刚结束播种工作的东北地区，棉苗也已经开始出土。
    主要产棉区黄河流域今年雨水适时，播种质量提高，棉苗出得齐全、长得茁壮，是近几年来没有过的现象。长江流域不少棉区，由于播种前后阴雨连绵，因而普遍缺苗、烂苗；现在正在查苗和补种。
    目前已经掌握的情况说明，全国绝大多数省份今年的棉花播种面积没有完成国家计划；比去年减少。今年国家计划播种棉花九千一百多万亩，已经比去年缩减了一些；但是各地今年实际播种的只有近八千八百万亩。这主要是因为：部分棉区低洼易涝，棉花产量很低，今年改种了粮食或其它作物；去年有些棉区受灾，棉花收成不好，农民为了解决度荒口粮，在棉田里种上了粮食；部分棉区往年的棉花种得过分集中，粮食、饲料和烧柴的供应不如粮区充裕、及时，今年多种了粮食。另外，有些地区播种季节雨水过多，也影响了播种面积。
    据新华社记者了解，今年全国的棉花播种面积虽然比去年减少了，但是仍然超过了除去年外的解放前后任何一年。同时，今年各地的棉田质量比过去好（主要是缩减了许多低产地区的棉田），全国的棉花良种播种面积比去年扩大了一千五百多万亩，国家准备供应的防治棉花病虫药剂数量比去年增加了两倍多，许多先进植棉技术经过去年的实践有了因地制宜的发挥、创造，主要产棉区黄河流域的棉花播种及时、生长良好；这些都是今年棉花生产的有利因素。如果今年年景正常，各地又能充分利用上述有利因素，加强田间管理，克服某些不利因素（如某些地区棉苗生长不好、棉田基肥不足等），提高单位面积产量，今年全国的棉花总产量完全有把握超过以往任何一年（包括丰收的1955年），并且有可能超过1957年的棉花总产量指标。
    农业部负责人说，现在到棉花收获还有三个多月。为了提高棉花的单位面积产量，争取今年的棉花增产丰收，在这个期间必须做好以下几件工作：（一）防治虫害，尽量利用国家准备充足的农药械，作到不因虫害而减产。根据往年经验，只要做到这点，就能增产15％—20％。为保证做好这件工作，各地农业社必须及早安排治虫的资金和劳动力，并希望各地政府帮助有些农业社克服资金不足的困难。（二）增施肥料。各地除了充分利用商品肥料外，要尽量利用人粪尿和各种农家肥料施行追肥。（三）麦收前后，农业社要合理安排劳力，做到麦收、夏种和棉花的锄草、治虫四不误。（四）加强后期棉田管理，做好灌溉、排涝、后期中耕和整枝等工作。
