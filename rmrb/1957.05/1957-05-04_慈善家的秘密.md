    The Philanthropist's Secret
    Cui Qi
    Probably no country in history has ever spent as much money on foreign affairs as the United States does today. According to the Associated Press, in the last ten years, the U.S. government has allocated approximately 56 billion U.S. dollars under the guise of foreign "aid." This means that each American has to bear an average of 330 U.S. dollars.
    What is the purpose of spending so much money? The American ruling class always postures as philanthropists, touting that this is to protect the "freedom" of other countries, to raise the living standards of economically underdeveloped countries, and to promote the "welfare" of these countries. Moreover, according to Dulles, this is to "give hope to the people there"…. In short, as oil tycoon Rockefeller admitted in a letter to Eisenhower in January 1956: "We must not be stingy in making it clear, using all the propaganda tools we have at our disposal, the selfless nature of the United States' policy of aiding underdeveloped countries."
    However, gradually, a series of questions arose in the minds of many Americans: Is it really worthwhile to be so "selfless"? Why does the U.S. government, with its already enormous annual expenses, need to add this extra expenditure? Why is the proportion of social welfare expenses in the annual total budget so small, yet huge sums are allocated to "aid" others?
    It seems that this is indeed a "mystery." Therefore, according to the "Washington Post" recently: The American "public is increasingly opposed to the government's foreign aid program." They are "unhappy about such incomprehensible and costly plans." At the same time, some have advocated cutting foreign aid funds.
    In this situation, the philanthropists are feeling a little anxious. They have discovered that the American public has a "general misunderstanding" of the foreign aid program, so they have to come out and tell some truth. They lowered their voices and said to the American public: Don't shout, we say that foreign aid is "selfless," that's just propaganda, it's actually entirely for the benefit of "America." Please look at the reports of various committees in the United States recently!
    The National Planning Association's report said: The foreign aid program is "beneficial" to the United States. For example, it can "increase the purchasing power of other countries and encourage the flow of necessities and raw materials needed by the United States into the United States." At the same time, it can also promote the export of American goods, "In 1948-1955, exports under foreign aid funds accounted for 46% of total U.S. exports." As for the "preferential law stipulating that at least 50% of foreign aid goods should be transported by American ships," it provides "certain help" to the American shipping industry.
    A consulting committee specifically responsible for studying the foreign aid program reported: The foreign aid program serves the political and economic interests of the United States, and implementing this program can create "a strong political and economic position" for the United States "in various countries."
    Reports from three other investigation groups stated that the U.S. foreign aid program has received "good returns." For example, through "aid," the United States has "saved" Iran. (Regarding the example of Iran, Rockefeller was also very proud. In his letter to Eisenhower, he wrote: "By using economic assistance, we were finally able to obtain Iranian oil, and our position in the economy of that country is now quite solid.")
    However, these benefits are only of the nature of making huge profits with little investment, and seizing by cunning. The goals that the U.S. foreign aid program wants to achieve go far beyond these. American bourgeois political commentator Lippmann wrote in the "Washington Post" on April 4, "The fact is: almost all of this money is used to support and unite the huge military alliance led by the United States that surrounds the Soviet Union and Red China." "The foreign aid program is essentially a tool of American foreign policy, and its purpose is to serve the national interests of the United States."
    In short, spending so much money seems worthwhile because it brings all kinds of benefits to the "nation" of the United States.
    Thus, the philanthropists came to a formula: to the outside world, it is necessary to publicize that the foreign aid program is "selfless"; internally, it is necessary to explain that this program is beneficial to the "nation" of the United States. Recently, some have even advocated simply separating "military aid" and "economic aid" so as to tell people: "Military aid" is for the benefit of "America," while "economic aid" is entirely to help others. It is said that doing so can eliminate the "misunderstanding caused domestically" and "the suspicion caused abroad" by the foreign aid program.
    However, the philanthropists have overreached themselves. They are like clowns wearing masks on the stage, who actually put on another set of masks in front of the audience. This is a double deception, but it is also the most foolish deception.
    It is not difficult for people to see who "American aid" is ultimately beneficial to, not the recipient countries, nor the American people. According to statistics, in 1955 alone, American companies' profits were 43 billion U.S. dollars, a large part of which was plundered from abroad, which is the reward for "American aid." But what do the broad masses of the American people get from the foreign aid program? They only bear more taxes for this extra expenditure.
    As for using the foreign aid program to support the U.S. military alliance, this is even more contrary to the peaceful interests of the American people. The "Chicago Tribune" recently wrote that what do the American people get from these foreign military aids? Only "a state of nervous tension." This newspaper also believes that the United States spends a lot of money to support military alliances and carry out "deterrence" against socialist countries, but the strength of socialist countries is even stronger, so the United States has to spend more money to further support military alliances…. As a result, "the whole effect is somewhat like a dog trying to catch its own tail in a losing race!"
    Now the problem is completely clear: Where did the 56 billion U.S. dollars spent in ten years go? First, the American monopoly capitalist group used it as a means of overseas economic plunder, and as a result, it turned into even larger profits and went back into the pockets of those people. Second, the decision-makers in the United States used it as capital for the "deterrence policy," and as a result, it was thrown into a bottomless pit in this "business" of "catching one's own tail." This is the whole secret of the philanthropists.

    慈善家的秘密
    崔奇
    大概历史上从来没有一个国家像今天的美国这样，每年要花那么多的钱用在外交活动上。据美联社统计，最近十年间，美国政府在对外“援助”名义下拨出的款项，约达五百六十亿美元。这也就是说，平均每个美国人要负担三百三十美元。
    花这么多的钱，究竟为了什么呢？美国统治集团总是以慈善家的姿态大肆宣传说：这是为了保护其他国家的“自由”，是为了提高经济不发达国家的生活水平，是为了促进这些国家的“福利”。还有，据杜勒斯说，这是为了“给那里的人民以希望”……。总之，正如石油大王洛克菲勒在1956年1月写给艾森豪威尔的信中所承认的：“在利用我们所掌握的一切宣传手段明白交代美国援助不发达国家的政策的大公无私的性质方面，我们绝不能吝啬。”
    但是，逐渐地，在许多美国人的头脑里却产生了一连串的疑问：这样“大公无私”下去，究竟值不值得呢？为什么美国政府每年的费用已经那么庞大，却还要额外增加这一笔开支呢？为什么在每年总预算中关于社会福利的费用所占的比重小得可怜，却反而要拨出巨款去“援助”别人呢？
    看来这的确是一个“谜”。因此，据“华盛顿邮报”最近说：美国“公众普遍地越来越反对政府的援外计划了”。他们“对于如此难以了解的费用浩大的计划感到不快”。同时，已经有人主张削减援外的款项。
    在这种情况下，慈善家们感到有些焦急了。他们发现美国公众对于援外计划产生了“普遍的误解”，于是不得不出来讲点真话。他们压低了声音向美国公众说：你们不要叫喊呀，我们说援外是“大公无私”的，那不过是宣传而已，实际上完全是为了“美国”的利益。请看最近期间美国各种各样的委员会的报告吧！
    国家计划协会的报告说：援外计划对美国是“有利的”。比如，它可以“增加其他国家的购买力，鼓励必需品和美国所需的原料流入美国”。同时，它也可以促进美国的商品输出，“在1948—1955年，对外援助经费项下的出口品占美国全部出口品的46％”。至于“规定至少使50％的外援商品由美国船只运送的优惠法”对美国航运业更有“一定的帮助”。
    专门负责研究援外计划的一个谘询委员会的报告说：援外计划是为美国的政治、经济利益服务的，执行这个计划就可使美国“在各个国家中”造成“政治上和经济上强有力的地位”。
    另外三个调查团体的报告说：美国援外计划已经获得“良好的报酬”。例如，通过“援助”，美国已经“挽救”了伊朗。（关于伊朗的例子，洛克菲勒也是很得意的，他在给艾森豪威尔的信中曾写道：“由于利用了经济援助，我们终于能够取得伊朗石油，并且我们现在在这个国家的经济中地位已经相当巩固。”）
    不过，这一些好处还只是属于一本万利、巧取豪夺之类。美国援外计划所要达到的目的远远不止这些。美国资产阶级政论家李普曼在4月4日的“华盛顿邮报”上就写过，“事实是：这笔款子差不多全部用于支持和团结以美国为首的包围苏联和红色中国的巨大军事同盟。”“外援计划本质上是美国外交政策的工具，目的是要为美国的国家利益服务。”
    总之，花这么多的钱似乎是值得的，因为它给美国的“国家”带来了各种各样的利益。
    于是，慈善家们就得出了一个公式：对外，要宣传援外计划是“大公无私”的；对内，要说明这个计划是对美国的“国家”有利的。近来，有人还主张，索性把“军事援助”和“经济援助”截然分开，以便告诉人们说：“军事援助”是为了“美国”利益的，“经济援助”则完全是为了帮助别人的。据说，这样做就可以消除援外计划“在国内引起的误解”和“在国外引起的怀疑”。
    但是，慈善家们弄巧成拙了。他们好像是舞台上戴假面具的丑角，居然当着观众的面就换上了另一套假面具。这是双重的欺骗，然而也是最愚蠢的欺骗。
    人们不难看穿“美援”究竟对谁有利，不是受援国，也不是美国人民。据统计，仅仅1955年一年美国公司的利润就有四百三十亿美元，其中很大一个数目是从国外掠夺去的，这也就是“美援”的报酬。可是，美国广大人民从援外计划中得到什么？他们不过是为了这笔额外开支而担负了更多的赋税而已。
    至于用援外计划来支持美国的军事同盟，这更是同美国人民的和平利益相违背的。“芝加哥论坛报”最近写道，美国人民从这些对外军事援助中得到的是什么呢？仅仅是“神经紧张的现状”。这个报纸并且认为，美国花了许多钱去支持军事同盟，对社会主义国家进行“威慑”，可是社会主义国家的力量却是更加强大了，于是美国又要花更多的钱去进一步支持军事同盟……。结果“整个效果有些像一只狗在输掉的比赛中去抓自己尾巴！”
    现在问题已经完全弄明白了：十年间，花了五百六十亿美元，究竟用到哪儿去了呢？第一，美国垄断资本集团把它作为海外经济掠夺的手段，结果变成更庞大的利润，又回到那些人的腰包里去了。第二，美国的决策人把它作为“威慑政策”的本钱，结果就在这种“抓自己尾巴”的“事业”中投到无底洞里去了。这就是慈善家们的全部秘密。
