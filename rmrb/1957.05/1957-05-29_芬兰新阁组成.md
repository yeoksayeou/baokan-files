Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 28th: A new government was formed on May 27th in Finland by a coalition of the Agrarian League, the Swedish People's Party, and the Finnish People's Party. The new government is headed by Sukselainen, chairman of the Agrarian League, as Prime Minister. The former Minister of Education, Virolainen of the Agrarian League, will serve as Foreign Minister.

The Social Democratic Party refused to join the new government and has become the opposition party. This governmental crisis was triggered by the party's break with the Agrarian League over the issue of wages. It holds fifty-four seats in the two hundred-seat parliament, making it the largest party in parliament. The three parties forming the new government together hold seventy-nine seats in parliament. The most important issue facing the new government is the problem of Finland's economic difficulties.

    芬兰新阁组成
    新华社28日讯　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰农民联盟、瑞典人民党和芬兰人民党在5月27日联合组成新政府。新政府由农民联盟主席苏克西莱宁任总理。前任教育部长、农民联盟的维洛莱宁任外交部长。
    社会民主党拒绝参加新政府，而成为政府的反对党。这次政府危机就是由于这个党在工资问题上同农民联盟决裂而引起的。它在议会的二百个议席中拥有五十四席，是议会中的第一大党。而组成新政府的三个党在议会中共拥有七十九席。新政府面临的最重要问题，是芬兰经济困难的问题。
