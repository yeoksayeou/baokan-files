Author's Letter to the Editor:

    Editor,

    On April 19th, the "People's Daily" published my article entitled "The Economic Background of British Military Spending Cuts." This article was edited and revised by the editor, and contains some opinions with which I disagree. There are two issues concerning the arguments:

    First, the third subheading in the published article is: "They urgently need to expand export industries to strengthen competition..." However, the subheading in my original manuscript was: "A New Stage of Replacing Industrial Equipment and Export Competition." The article stated: "They demand increased domestic investment, replacing new industrial equipment, in order to expand exports in the increasingly fierce international market." Since the second half of 1956, an increasing amount of British production equipment has not been utilized due to insufficient sales. According to an estimate in the January 5th issue of the British "Economist" magazine, the value of production equipment in Britain, which has been completed due to past investment but not utilized due to production stagnation, could reach 1 billion to 1.5 billion pounds this year. Of course, British monopoly capital also hopes to release some technical personnel and production equipment from certain military sectors. At the same time, the replacement will inevitably increase equipment production capacity; however, in general, their main purpose is to replace equipment, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs to engage in competition, rather than competing by expanding export industries.

    Second, the last paragraph of the article was added by the editor, stating that the new plan's reduction in military spending is not very large, and at the same time, the budget cuts do not benefit the broad masses of workers, so it is a big question whether it can solve many problems. This is irrelevant to the topic. My view on whether military disarmament can solve the problem is: first, since Britain cannot abandon the illusion of the so-called "nuclear deterrent," it cannot truly get rid of the shackles of the American Cold War policy, and therefore cannot permanently and effectively get rid of the heavy burden of military economics. Second, the conspiracy to strengthen "control" over the people of Asia and Africa will inevitably be buried by the torrent of history. What the people of Asia and Africa need in the process of economic construction is selfless assistance, not imperialist conspiracies. This leads to the third point, that only under the principles of peaceful coexistence and equality and mutual benefit can Britain find a way out that benefits both itself and others. Although demanding to improve the living standards of the working people is completely correct, writing it in this way does not explain anything.

    作者来信编辑同志：
    4月19日“人民日报”发表了我的一篇文章，题目是“英国削减军费开支的经济背景”。这篇文章经编者作了删改，包含了一些我所不同意的意见。有两个有关论点的问题：
    一，文章发表时的第三个小题是：“他们急需扩大出口工业，以便加强竞争……。”但是，我的原稿中的小标题是：“更置工业设备与出口竞争的新阶段”。文中说： “他们要求扩大国内投资，更置新式工业设备，以便在竞争日益剧烈的国际市场上扩大出口。”大致从1956年下半年以来，英国有愈来愈多的生产设备因销路不足而没有利用，加强竞争并不是由扩大工业中去想办法的。根据1月5日英国“经济学家”杂志的估计，英国由于过去投资而落成，又因为生产停滞未能利用的生产设备，在今年可以合到一年十亿到十五亿镑的产值。固然，英国垄断资本也希望从某些军事部门中放出一些技术人员和生产设备来，同时，更置的结果也无可避免地要增加设备生产能力；但是，总的说来，他们的目的主要在于更置设备、提高劳动生产率和降低成本来从事竞争，而不是从扩大出口工业来竞争。
    二，文章的最后一段是编者加的，里面说，新计划削减军费数目还不很大，同时预算的削减，广大工人群众并无得益，因此能解决多少问题还是一个大疑问。这是和本题无关的。裁减军备是否能解决问题，我的看法是：第一，英国既然不能放弃所谓“核子威慑力量”的幻想，也就无法真正摆脱美国冷战政策的桎梏，因而也就无法长期地、有效地摆脱军事经济的重担。第二，加强对亚非人民的“控制”的阴谋到头来必然会被历史的巨流所埋葬，亚非人民在经济建设过程中所需要的，是无私的援助，不是帝国主义的阴谋。这就引至第三点，即只有在和平共处和平等互利的原则下，英国才能找到利己利人的出路。尽管要求提高劳动人民生活是完全正确的，但这样一笔写在这里却不能说明什么问题。　姚念庆
