    Zhang Linchi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, Participates in Physical Labor

    (Our Newspaper) News: Zhang Linchi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, took the lead in participating in physical labor at the Shuangqiao State Farm in Beijing, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the farm's employees.

    On the morning of April 30th, Vice Minister Zhang Linchi carried a large hoe and went to the fields to cultivate cabbage alongside the workers. Under his driving influence, Farm Director Su Bing, who had just recovered from illness, and Vice Farm Director Jing Liang, a student who had never held a hoe before, also picked up hoes. The production team leaders were even more unwilling to lag behind, and they went to the fields to work with the workers. Many workers were deeply moved to see the cadres carrying hoes, especially to see Vice Minister Zhang working alongside them. They said: Vice Minister Zhang is so busy, yet he still comes to the fields to participate in labor. We should work even harder! Others said: With the cadres carrying hoes, we can be confident in improving our farm's production. (Zhang Yi)

    农垦部副部长张林池参加体力劳动
    本报讯　农垦部张林池副部长在北京国营双桥农场带头参加体力劳动，大大鼓舞了农场职工的生产积极性。
    4月30日上午，张林池副部长扛起大锄，下地和工人们一起中耕洋白菜。在他的带动影响下，生病刚好不久的苏冰场长和学生出身的从来没有拿过锄头的景良副场长，也都扛起了锄头；生产队长们更是不甘落后，纷纷下地和工人们一块干活。许多工人看到干部扛起了锄头，特别是看到张副部长和自己一起劳动，都十分感动。他们说：张副部长那么忙，还下地参加劳动。咱们更应该好好干啊！还有的说：干部都扛起了锄头，搞好咱场的生产可有把握了。　　　（张毅）
