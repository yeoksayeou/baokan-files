    Bamboo Walls and Thatched Roofs
    The offices, canteens, and some dormitories of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory are all built with bamboo and straw. The cost of these buildings is only more than eight yuan per square meter, and they will not collapse for ten or eight years.
    This is the factory director's office. The interior walls are made of bamboo, plastered with mud and lime. Xinhua News Agency reporter Jin Xuqi photo

    竹墙草顶
    成都量具刃具厂的办公室、食堂和部分宿舍，都是用竹子和稻草盖成的。这些建筑物每平方公尺造价只八元多，住十年八年也不会倒场。
    这是厂长办公室，室内墙壁都是用竹子编的，上面抹的是泥和石灰。    新华社记者　金勗棋摄
