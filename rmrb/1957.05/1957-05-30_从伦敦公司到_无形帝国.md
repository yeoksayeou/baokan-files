    From the London Company to an "Invisible Empire"

    On May 14, 1607, ships of the English London Company arrived at Jamestown on the James River in Virginia, North America, where they established the first permanent colony of the British Empire in North America. This year marks the 350th "anniversary" of this event, and celebrations have been in full swing on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, distinguished ladies and dignitaries from both Britain and the United States braved the pouring rain at London Airport to hold a solemn naming ceremony for three U.S. Air Force aircraft, bestowing upon them the names of the three British ships that arrived at Jamestown 350 years ago; then, these three U.S. aircraft flew continuously for eight hours to reach Jamestown. For this event, Jamestown held a "celebration" at which British Ambassador Caccia and U.S. Vice President Nixon both delivered speeches, making it quite a spectacle.

    However, in the face of this scene, one cannot help but feel a sense of things not being what they once were. The former North American colonies, now the United States of America, are not only everywhere undermining the foundations of the British Empire, which was once its "suzerain," but have also bluntly called it a "second-rate power," even going so far as to talk about its "decline." Ambassador Caccia had to meaningfully say to the American audience at the "celebration," "Don't make the mistake that others do, and don't leave Britain out of the equation," because "remember that it was they who began the American epic at Jamestown," clearly with "a special feeling in his heart"!

    In fact, while talk of a "second-rate power" or "decline" is distressing, what is more worthy of reflection is that, even as London and Jamestown are celebrating the 350th anniversary of British colonization of Jamestown with great fanfare, people in Texas are cheering the fact that the United States began "colonizing" the British Empire in the 1950s. According to recent reports in British and American newspapers, the "British-Texas Realm" of the American racist terrorist organization "Ku Klux Klan Invisible Empire Aryan Knights" has established "colonies" (to use the words of "Newsweek") in seven major cities in Britain, including London, Birmingham, and Liverpool. Their "mother country's" "royal city" is located in Valley Mills, Texas. To date, this American "invisible empire" has already ruled nearly a thousand British "subjects." Moreover, in the words of a British Klansman, "Who knows how many membership forms are crossing the Atlantic!"

    Although British Home Secretary Butler said in the House of Commons that the scale of the Ku Klux Klan's activities in Britain is currently "still small," in any case, this stinking organization "colonized" from the United States has already begun its "epic" in the important cities of the British Empire.

### 从伦敦公司到“无形帝国”

    从伦敦公司到“无形帝国”
    1607年5月14日，英国伦敦公司的船只来到了北美弗吉尼亚州杰姆斯河上的杰姆斯城，在那里建立了大英帝国在北美的第一个永久殖民地。今年是这个事件的三百五十周年“纪念”，大西洋两岸为此着实敲锣打鼓地热闹了一番。例如，英美两国高贵的太太和显要们在伦敦飞机场上冒着倾盆大雨十二万分一本正经地为三架美国空军的飞机举行了命名典礼，把三百五十年以前驶达杰姆斯城的三艘英国船的名字授给了这三架美国飞机；然后，这三架美国飞机连续飞行了八个小时，抵达了杰姆斯城。为这件事，杰姆斯城举行了“庆祝会”，英国驻美大使卡西亚和美国副总统尼克松都发表了演说，真是够热闹的了。
    但是，面对此情此景，总不免使人有一种今非昔比的感觉。往昔的北美殖民地，而今的美利坚合众国，不仅到处在拆一度是它“宗主国”的大英帝国的墙脚，而且已经老实不客气地把它称为“二等国”，以至大谈其“衰落”了。卡西亚大使要在“庆祝会”上意味深长地对美国听众说，“不要像别人那样打错算盘，不把英国考虑在内”，因为“要记得是他们在杰姆斯城开始美国的史诗的”，显然“别是一般滋味在心头”！
    其实，“二等国”或者“衰落”之类的谈论虽然使人伤心，但更值得引人深思的还是：正当伦敦和杰姆斯城锣鼓喧天地纪念英国在三百五十年以前向杰姆斯城殖民的时候，得克萨斯州却有人在欢呼美国在二十世纪五十年代开始向大英帝国“殖民”的事实。据不久前英美报刊报道，美国的种族恐怖组织“三K党无形帝国亚利安骑士团”的“英国—得克萨斯王国”已经在英国的伦敦、伯明翰、利物浦等七大城镇建立了“殖民地”（美国“新闻周刊”用语）。它们的“宗主国”的“王城”设在得克萨斯州的怀谷。迄今为止，美国的这个“无形帝国”已经统治了近千名英国的“臣民”。而且，用一个英国三K党徒的话说，“谁知道有多少张会员表格正在越过大西洋呢！”
    尽管英国内政大臣巴特勒在下院说，三K党在英国活动的规模暂时“还很小”，可是无论如何，这个从美国“殖民”进来的臭气熏天的组织，已经在大英帝国的重要城市中开始了它的“史诗”了。　　（元）
