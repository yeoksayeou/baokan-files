Xinhua News Agency reporter Fan Yinhuai reports: The director of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory told reporters today that the Ministry of Railways should earnestly examine its bureaucratic and commandist work style towards its subordinate units in this rectification movement. The state inspectors and finished product acceptance inspectors sent by the ministry to the factory mechanically apply the ministry's orders and regulations, and many things that the factory should do cannot be done because they are not "legal."

The director said that the factory leaders have a feeling of fear when they hear that the ministry is sending people to inspect work. Usually, when they hear in telephone conferences that the factory's work is somewhat poor, they sternly criticize without asking about the difficulties and reasons. Last year, when the Minister of Railways came to the factory to inspect work, the factory's Party Secretary was criticized by name in several cadre meetings because he did not answer a number in a timely manner. The ministry also fails to humbly listen to the opinions of those below when calling factory directors to meetings. At a conference of factory directors and Party secretaries convened by the Ministry of Railways last year, the factory director and Party secretary of this factory were both interrupted during their speeches by the minister, who said, "You don't need to say any more, I know this little thing better than you."

The director also pointed out that the leaders of the Ministry of Railways often excessively complain and blame subordinates, while they rarely examine their own shortcomings and mistakes.

    太原机车修理厂批评铁道部
    检查自己少  责备下级多
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者范银怀报道：太原机车车辆修理厂厂长今天向记者说，铁道部在这次整风运动中应该认真地检查对待所属单位的官僚主义和命令主义作风。部里派驻厂里的国家检查员和成品验收员，过于机械地搬用部令规章，厂里应该办的许多事情也因不“合法”而不能办。
    这位厂长说，厂领导人员听说部里派人检查工作，就有一种恐惧的情绪。平时在电话会议上一听说厂里工作差一些，不问困难和原因就厉声指责。去年铁道部部长来厂检查工作，厂里党委书记因为没有及时回答出一个数字，部长就在几次干部大会上点名批评。部里在召集厂长开会时，也不能虚心听取下面的意见。去年在铁道部召开的厂长、党委书记参加的一次会议上，这个厂的厂长、党委书记在发言中都被部长以“你不用说了，这一件小事情我还不比你知道”的话，中途制止了发言。
    这位厂长还提出铁道部领导上常常过多地埋怨和责备下级，而对本身的缺点和错误检查的很少。
