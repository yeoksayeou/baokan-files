Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 8th dispatch via Middle East News Agency: Leaflets distributed by Jordan's National Party Coalition have been discovered in several major cities in Jordan. These leaflets reveal details of a conspiracy aimed at striking patriotic and national forces in the army and among the people, and imposing the Eisenhower Doctrine on Jordan. The leaflets state that the current Deputy Prime Minister Rifai discussed the implementation of this conspiracy in two stages with US President's Special Envoy Richards during his stay in Beirut. The first stage began with King Hussein's declaration of "fighting communism," and the second stage began with the government's acceptance of $10 million in emergency aid from the United States.

According to a report from Amman by the Indian Press Trust, sources at the US Embassy in Jordan said on the 9th that the United States plans to provide additional economic aid to Jordan, which has effectively accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine.

During the political crisis in Jordan, the United States has already provided Jordan with $10 million in aid to support King Hussein.

The report quotes Jordanian sources as saying that US aid to Jordan in the next two years will not be less than the approximately $35 million in annual financial subsidies that Britain provided to Jordan before the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian treaty. In the past, Britain used these subsidies to maintain Jordan's subordinate status to Britain.

At the same time, the crackdown on patriotic elements in Jordan has now reached its peak. The Al-Abadli camp in the suburbs of Amman is filled with thousands of arrested nationalists. In addition, many arrested individuals have been sent to the Al-Jafr camp established by Glubb Pasha, commander of the Arab Legion, to be tortured. Some detained communists have been transferred from various prisons in Jordan to places where they will soon be tried.

The "Izvestia" reported on the 9th that all Jordanian officers who had been purged after Glubb Pasha was expelled have been reinstated. Glubb's assistant, Emile Gomaian, has returned from Cyprus. He was stripped of his Jordanian nationality for working as a broadcaster for the "Voice of Britain" radio station.

Jordanian radio has begun propaganda attacks on Egypt and Syria. The Jordanian government has appointed the editor-in-chief of the Muslim Brotherhood's organ, "Islamic Struggle," to conduct these attacks through the Jerusalem radio station. Jordanian police have banned the public from listening to broadcasts from Cairo, Damascus, and the "Voice of the Arabs," and have confiscated radios from refugee camps.

### 约旦全国党派联合组织  揭露美国干涉内政的黑幕  安曼郊区集中营挤满受难的爱国者

    约旦全国党派联合组织
    揭露美国干涉内政的黑幕
    安曼郊区集中营挤满受难的爱国者
    本报综合报道　据新华社引中东通讯社5月8日大马士革消息，在约旦的一些主要城市发现了由约旦全国党派联合组织散发的传单。这些传单揭露了目的在于打击陆军和人民中的爱国民族力量以及把艾森豪威尔主义强加在约旦身上的谋阴的详情。传单说，现任副首相里法伊曾经在美国总统特使理查兹停留在贝鲁特的时候和他商定分两个阶段实行这种阴谋。第一个阶段是从侯赛因国王发表“同共产主义作斗争”的声明开始，第二个阶段从政府接受美国的一千万美元的紧急援助开始。
    另据印度报业托辣斯从安曼报道，美国驻约旦大使馆人士9日说，美国计划给实际上已经接受艾森豪威尔主义的约旦以额外的经济援助。
    在约旦政局危机期间，美国已经给了约旦一千万美元的援助，以支持侯赛因国王。
    消息引约旦人士的话指出，美国在今后两年对约旦的援助不会少于在英—约条约废除以前英国每年给约旦的约三千五百万美元财政补贴。英国过去正是通过这笔补贴来保持约旦对英国的从属地位的。
    与此同时，约旦搜捕爱国分子的运动目前已经发展到顶点。安曼郊区的阿巴德利营挤满了成千被捕的民族主义者。另外还有许多被捕的人被送往前阿拉伯军团司令格拉布设立的阿勒加弗尔营受酷刑。某些被拘留的共产党人已经从约旦的各个监狱被移送到准备即将审判他们的地方。
   “消息报”9日报道，所有在格拉布被赶走以后被清除的约旦军官已经复职。格拉布的助手埃米来·高迈安已经从塞浦路斯回国。他因为在“英国之音”电台当广播员而被剥夺了约旦国籍。
    约旦的广播电台已经开始了对埃及和叙利亚的宣传攻击。约旦政府指派穆斯林兄弟会机关报“伊斯兰斗争报”的主编通过耶路撒冷电台进行这种攻击。约旦警察禁止公众收听开罗、大马士革和“阿拉伯之音”的广播，并且没收了难民营的无线电收音机。
