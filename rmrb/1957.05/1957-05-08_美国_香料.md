    American "Spice"

    The British Broadcasting Corporation's television director, Mr. Beadle, said on May 3rd that the BBC will open a second television network in Britain by 1960 or 1961. The Associated Press called the BBC's plan a "decisive struggle" against the American "occupation" of British television lines. The Associated Press said that due to the popularity of American television programs in Britain, there is currently pressure to cut back on American broadcast programs.

    The British are indeed very resentful of broadcasting American programs on television. On April 20th, the "Daily Mirror" complained that during Easter in Britain, the BBC broadcast four American films. The implication was that this was quite outrageous. "New York Times" reporter Seddon seized upon the "Daily Mirror's" complaint and wrote an article entitled "American Clothes, Television, Gadgets Add Spice to British Way of Life." The implication was: "Don't complain."

    According to Seddon, there is quite a bit of American "spice" in the British way of life. Television is certainly one. Moreover, on Easter Day, not only did the BBC broadcast four American television programs, but in the privately-run commercial television programs, there were five programs that were completely American or "inspired" by American programs. And on Easter night, nine of London's thirty-two theaters were showing American films, and another three were showing films starring American movie stars abroad. The proportion of American films in the suburbs and provinces is said to be even higher.

    Seddon said that American "spice" also includes novels depicting adventure, eroticism, and crime, "Hollywood-style" and "Broadway-style" clothing, and American music. To prove that this is the result of the British people's own love of the American way of life, rather than the export of the American way of life, he specifically cited the British "People" as an example. He said that the April 21st issue of the "People" had a total of twelve pages, and except for thirty-eight lines of foreign news on the first page, the rest of the pages were filled with articles like "If You Go to Hollywood, You Can't Afford Love." It seems that the British have to take responsibility for themselves.

    However, Seddon cannot help but admit that not all Britons like American "spice." He regretfully pointed out that although advertisements for American soft drinks are everywhere, they have not had a huge impact on the British diet. And the British middle class is most strongly resisting American "spice," from cocktails to school building forms.

    The British once brought many ancient Egyptian pharaoh mummies from Egypt to the British Museum. They certainly know the role of spices in the making of mummies. As to whether American "spice" will turn British culture into a "mummy" displayed in the Boston Museum, that depends entirely on Britain itself. (Lin)

### 美国“香料”

    美国“香料”
    英国广播公司的电视部主任比德尔在5月3日说，英国广播公司到1960年或1961年，将在英国开设第二个电视网。美联社把英国广播公司这个计划，称之为对美国“侵占”英国的电视线路进行“断然的斗争”。美联社说，由于美国的电视节目在英国非常流行，英国目前有人在施加压力，要削减美国的广播节目。
    英国人对于电视节目里播送美国节目，的确很有反感。“每日镜报”在4月20日埋怨说，在英国的复活节，英国广播公司却播送了四部美国片子。言下颇有太不像话之意。“纽约时报”的记者赛德尔顿抓住“每日镜报”的这种埋怨，写了一篇文章，题目叫做“美国的服装、电视、小玩意儿给英国生活方式添加了香料”。言下之意就是：“请勿埋怨”。
    据赛德尔顿说，英国生活方式里的美国“香料”是不少的。电视当然是一种。而且，在复活节那一天，不光英国广播公司播送了四档美国电视节目，在私人办的商业的电视节目里，还有五档节目是完全美国的或者是从美国节目中取得“灵感”的。而在复活节那天晚上，伦敦三十二家戏院有九家放映美国影片，另外三家放映美国电影明星在国外演的片子。而美国电影在郊区和外省所占的比例，据说还要高。
    赛德尔顿说，美国的“香料”还包括描写冒险、色情和犯罪的小说，“好莱坞式”、“百老汇式”的服装，美国的音乐。为了证明这是英国人自己爱好美国生活方式而不是美国生活方式输出的结果，他特地举了英国的“人民报”作为例子。他说，4月21日的“人民报”一共有十二页，除了第一页有三十八行的国外新闻以外，其余各页全是登的像“如果你要到好莱坞去的话，你花费不起爱情”之类的文章。看来，英国人只好为他们自己负责了。
    可是，赛德尔顿却又不能不承认，并不是所有英国人都喜欢美国“香料”。他遗憾地指出，虽然美国轻饮料的广告到处都是，可是对英国人的饮食没有发生巨大的影响。而英国的中产阶级，在最强烈地抗拒美国的“香料”，从鸡尾酒一直到学校的建筑形式。
    英国人曾经从埃及弄了不少古埃及法老的木乃伊到大英博物馆里去，他们当然知道香料在制造木乃伊中所起的作用。至于美国“香料”是否会把英国文化变成陈列在波士顿博物馆里的“木乃伊”，这就完全要看英国自己了。（林）
