Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 25th: Bonn News: The Social Democratic Party parliamentary group of the West German Federal Parliament announced the "Ollenhauer Plan" a few hours before Adenauer's departure for the United States on May 24. This plan requires the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to link the issues of restoring German reunification and establishing a European security system as a whole, and to negotiate on this issue with the participation of Germans. It pointed out that people should not negotiate the issue of "free elections" to restore German reunification separately without simultaneously negotiating the military status of a unified Germany.

The "Ollenhauer Plan" regarding the plan to restore German reunification is still: 1. First, "free elections" should be held throughout Germany under "international supervision" to elect a "National Assembly," then formulate a constitution, and "promulgate temporary federal or all-German power organization laws based on principles close to the 1919 Weimar National Assembly resolutions," and establish an "All-German Central Government" to conclude a peace treaty; 2. The "All-German Central Government" should conclude an agreement with the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the issue of the stationing of these four countries' troops in Germany, "this agreement shall take effect before the treaty on the European security system comes into effect." The plan did not mention the issue of reaching understanding and agreement between the two Germanies.

Regarding the relationship between a reunified Germany and the European collective security system, the "Ollenhauer Plan" advocates that the security system should include a reunified Germany and its eastern and western neighbors, and these countries should assume obligations of mutual non-aggression and mutual assistance against aggressors. Within this system, an arbitration system should also be formulated to peacefully resolve disputes, and a system of arms limitation and arms supervision should be implemented.

The security system must comply with the United Nations Charter and be recognized by the United Nations, and must be supported by the United States and the Soviet Union.

The plan stated: "In view of the great difficulties in immediately establishing a European security system and in the two parts of Germany withdrawing from their respective military blocs, it is necessary to gradually develop a mutual guarantee agreement between the four countries and the All-German government. This agreement should stipulate: 1. The inviolability of the entire German territory; 2. Opposition to the use of force to resolve disputes; 3. Recognition of the United Nations' provisions on adjusting disputes."

    就德国统一和欧洲安全问题
    “奥伦豪尔计划”提出主张
    新华社柏林25日电　波恩消息：西德联邦议院社会民主党议会党团5月24日在阿登纳启程访美前几小时公布了“奥伦豪尔计划”，这个计划要求苏、美、英、法四国把恢复德国统一和建立欧洲安全体系的问题联系起来作为一个整体，并且在德国人与闻下就此进行谈判。它指出，人们不应该单独谈判恢复德国统一的“自由选举”问题，而不同时谈判全德的军事地位问题。
      “奥伦豪尔计划”关于恢复德国统一的方案仍然是：一、首先在“国际监督”下在全德举行“自由选举”，选出“国民议会”，然后制定宪法，并且在“接近1919年魏玛国民议会决议的原则下颁布临时的联邦或全德政权机构组织法”，成立“全德中央政府”以便缔结和约；二、由“全德中央政府”同苏、美、英、法四国缔结关于这四国在德国驻军问题的协定，“这个协定在欧洲安全体系条约生效以前就生效”。计划并没有提到两个德国之间达成谅解和协议的问题。
    关于统一后的德国和欧洲集体安全体系的关系，“奥伦豪尔计划”主张，安全体系应当包括统一后的德国和它的东西邻邦在内，这些国家应当彼此承担互不侵犯的义务和反抗侵略者的互助义务。在这个体系内，还应该制定一种仲裁制度，以便和平解决争端，并且实行军备限制和军备监督制度。
    安全体系必须符合联合国宪章和获得联合国承认，并且必须获得美苏两国的支持。
    计划说：“鉴于要立刻建立欧洲安全体系和要德国两部分退出双方的军事集团还有巨大困难，因此，必须通过逐步的发展导致四国同全德政府缔结一项互相保证的协定。这项协定应当规定：一、全德领土的不可侵犯性；二、反对以武力解决争端；三、承认联合国关于调整争端的条款。”
