Does the Bourgeoisie Have Two Sides?
Chao Youde and Zheng Dongyuan Present Some Materials

At the Hebei Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Hebei Provincial Political Consultative Committee members Chao Youde and Zheng Dongyuan said in their speeches: For more than a year, more than 97% of private personnel in Tangshan City have participated in labor competitions. 1,279 people have been named advanced workers and received material rewards, 39 of whom have won the title of advanced worker for three consecutive quarters. However, according to a check of 488 joint-venture commercial outlets in January of this year, the negative aspects of our private personnel are very prominent. Because of irresponsibility in business operations and poor management, there were 2,549 instances of cash surpluses or shortages, and 8,929 kinds of commodity losses; private personnel accounted for 20 of the 29 cases of illegal and undisciplined behavior, corruption, and theft; private personnel accounted for 541 of the 885 cases of taking advantage of public property; and private personnel accounted for 196 of the 247 cases of embezzlement of public funds. Calculated by offsetting the surplus and shortage of cash with commodity losses, the state suffered a loss of more than 5,800 yuan. The methods of corruption and theft are selling goods without issuing invoices, collecting accounts receivable without recording them, overstating the quantity when purchasing raw materials, and some even directly stealing cash every day. The embezzlement of public funds is carried out by taking advantage of the convenience of going out to purchase goods or the enterprise having petty cash on hand, some even lasting as long as three months. Chao Youde and Zheng Dongyuan said: Isn't this a concrete manifestation of the bourgeoisie's negative aspects of harming public interests for private gain?

    资产阶级有没有两面性？
    晁幼德、郑东园提出了一些材料
    河北省政协委员晁幼德、郑东园在河北省政协会上发言说：一年多以来，唐山市有97％以上的私方人员参加了劳动竞赛。被评为先进工作者和受到物质奖励的有一千二百七十九人次，其中有三十九人连续三个季度获得了先进工作者的称号。但是，根据今年1月份在四百八十八个合营商业门市部的检查，我们私方人员的消极一面非常突出。因为对企业经营不负责任，管理不善，长短款达二千五百四十九次，商品发生损失的有八千九百二十九种；违法乱纪贪污盗窃的二十九件事件中，私方人员占二十件；占公家便宜的事件八百八十五件中私方人员占五百四十一件；挪用公款二百四十七件事件中，私方人员占一百九十六件。按长短款和商品损失两者相抵计算，使国家遭到五千八百多元的损失。贪污盗窃的手段是卖货不开发票，收回应收账款不入账，购进原料时多开数量，有的甚至每天直接盗窃货款。挪用公款的则是利用出外采购或企业留有备用现金的方便而进行挪用，有的竟达三月之久。晁幼德和郑东园说：难道这还不是资产阶级损公利私的消极一面的具体表现吗？
