　　“Strange Talk” Is Not Necessarily "Strange"
　　There are many farmers like Li Shiduo who are full of complaints and often say some "strange things." They say "strange things" partly because they are not yet accustomed to the new life after the great social changes, and partly because there are indeed some shortcomings in the various tasks of the newborn socialist cause.
　　Regardless of the reasons why they say "strange things," the vast majority of them have no intention of opposing the new system; on the contrary, some people say "strange things" precisely because they urgently demand that the agricultural cooperatives be run well.
　　They don't know who to raise their opinions to.
　　They have not yet learned to live a democratic life, and they don't know if they "dare" to raise opinions.
　　They have indeed encountered setbacks when raising opinions—because the cooperative cadres also have not yet learned to live a democratic life and lack a democratic spirit. Some people have indeed been labeled as "backward elements" because they have "too many opinions."
　　As a result, legitimate opinions are circulating in secret in the form of "strange talk."
　　Don't be disgusted as soon as you hear "strange talk," calmly analyze it. Even if it is "strange talk," you can still draw some useful things from it, not to mention that some words are not "strange" at all.

### “怪话”不一定都“怪”

    “怪话”不一定都“怪”
    有许多像李时铎这样的农民，他们满腹牢骚，常说一些“怪话”。他们说“怪话”，一部分是由于对社会大变革以后的新的生活还不习惯，一部分是由于新生的社会主义事业的各项工作中确实有些缺点。
    不管他们说“怪话”的原因是什么，他们之中绝大部分人并无意反对新的制度；恰恰相反，有些人说“怪话”的出发点正是迫切要求把农业社办好。
    他们不知道有意见该向谁提。
    他们还不会过民主生活，有意见不知道“敢不敢”提。
    他们也确实曾经在提意见的时候碰过钉子——因为社干部也还不会过民主生活，也缺乏民主精神。还有的人确实因为“意见多”被扣上了“落后分子”的帽子。
    于是，正当的意见在背地里以“怪话”的形式流行起来了。
    不要一听见“怪话”就厌恶，平心静气地分析一下它吧。即使是“怪话”，也能从中吸取一些有益的东西呢，何况有些话其实并不“怪”。
