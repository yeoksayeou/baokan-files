Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 24th: West German Chancellor Adenauer left Bonn on the 23rd to hold talks with Eisenhower and Dulles in the United States. This is Adenauer's fifth official visit to the United States since taking office as Chancellor.

Adenauer's visit to the United States comes as the West German election campaign is gradually unfolding. Sources say that Adenauer is worried that the United States may reach some kind of agreement with the Soviet Union on disarmament, which would put his Christian Democratic Union at a disadvantage in the election. Therefore, he will request the U.S. government in the talks to "fully guarantee" its support for the current policy of the West German government, and demand that the United States oppose any disarmament plan that stipulates the neutralization of Germany, and continue to insist on restoring German unification as the main condition for any agreement between East and West, so that his Christian Democratic Union can have more "political capital" in the election campaign for the general election in September this year.

The British Defence White Paper and the issue of Britain's decision to withdraw some troops from West Germany will also be important topics for the meeting between the U.S. and West German government leaders. Sources say that Adenauer will ask the U.S. government to help persuade Britain to postpone or at least greatly slow down the second phase of troop withdrawals.

Adenauer will also discuss the ratification of the "Common Market" treaty with the U.S. President and Secretary of State. Sources say that he will ask the United States to urge other member states of the "Common Market" to ratify the treaty before the West German general election in September.

    西德政府面临大选的风暴
    阿登纳赴美找政治资本
    据新华社24日讯　波恩消息：西德总理阿登纳23日离开波恩前往美国同艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯举行会谈。这是阿登纳出任总理以来第五次正式访问美国。
    阿登纳这次访问美国是在西德竞选运动正在逐步展开的时候进行的。有消息说：阿登纳担心美国会在裁军问题上同苏联达成某种协议，从而使他的基督教民主联盟在竞选中处于不利地位。因此，他将在会谈中要求美国政府“充分保证”支持西德政府的现行政策，并且要求美国反对规定德国中立化的任何裁军计划，继续坚持把恢复德国统一作为东西方的任何协议的主要条件，以便使他的基督教民主联盟在今年9月大选的竞选运动中握有较多的“政治资本”。
    英国的国防白皮书和英国决定从西德撤退一部分军队的问题，也将成为美国和西德政府首脑会谈的重要题目。有消息说：阿登纳将要求美国政府帮助劝说英国推迟或者至少大大地放慢第二批的撤军。
    阿登纳还要同美国总统和国务卿讨论“共同市场”条约的批准问题。有消息说：他将要求美国催促“共同市场”其他成员国在9月西德大选之前批准上述条约。
