    The Soviet Union is Intensively Reorganizing Economic Management
    The National Economic Council of Belarus is Being Organized
    Many Enterprises Begin to Strengthen Collaboration and Unleash Production Potential
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) According to the resolutions of the Seventh Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, work is underway intensively throughout the Soviet Union to reorganize the management of industry and construction. This work should be completed before July 1.
    The Belorussian Republic, this economic administrative region, already abolished the two Union-Republic ministries - the Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and the Ministry of Construction - on May 15, and established a general construction bureau under the Council of Ministers of the Republic to manage the construction work in the Republic in a unified manner. At the upcoming session of the Republic's Supreme Soviet, the abolition of the Republic's seven production and construction departments will be discussed. The Republic's National Economic Council is also being organized. The National Economic Council will manage 835 industrial enterprises, which were previously managed by 28 ministries and competent authorities.
    The workers of Soviet enterprises warmly support the law on reorganizing national economic management. The staff of many enterprises have begun to consider how to tap production potential under the new conditions, and have already begun to take action. Two adjacent large factories in Minsk—the automobile factory and the tractor factory—have discussed collaboration in the production of steel castings. In the past, the automobile factory's production costs for small steel castings were three times higher than those of the tractor factory due to incomplete equipment. Now, the two factories have agreed that the tractor factory will meet most of the automobile factory's needs for steel castings. In addition, the automobile factory used to want the neighboring tractor parts factory to supply certain machine parts, but negotiations always failed. Now these problems have been readily solved. In the Sverdlovsk Oblast (also an economic administrative region), the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Company was recently established. This is a combination of seven enterprises, including the former Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant, the Kuibyshev Factory, the coking plant, the refractory brick factory, and the iron mine. Under the unified company leadership, the past situation of lack of communication and mutual obstruction among the enterprises has disappeared, and the management staff has also been streamlined.

    苏联紧张进行经济管理改组
    白俄罗斯的国民经济委员会正在组织中
    许多企业开始加强协作和发挥生产潜力
    本报讯　苏联各地正在根据苏联最高苏维埃第七次会议的决议，紧张地进行着改组工业和建设管理的工作。这项工作应当于7月1日以前完成。
    白俄罗斯共和国这个经济行政区，已经在5月15日把联盟兼共和国的两个部——城乡建设部和建造部撤销，在共和国部长会议下成立了一个建设总局，统一管理共和国内的建筑工作。在即将举行的共和国最高苏维埃会议上，将要讨论撤销共和国的七个生产和建设方面的部。共和国的国民经济委员会也正在组织中。国民经济委员会将管理八百三十五个工业企业，这些企业过去是由二十八个部和主管机关管理的。
    苏联企业的劳动者热烈拥护改组国民经济管理的法律。许多企业的职工已经开始考虑在新的条件下如何发掘生产潜力，而且已经开始行动起来。明斯克两个相邻的大工厂——汽车制造厂和拖拉机制造厂已经讨论了在生产钢铸件方面的协作问题。汽车制造厂过去在生产小型钢铸件方面因设备不全而成本比拖拉机制造厂要贵三倍。现在两个工厂商量好，由拖拉机制造厂满足汽车制造厂所需的钢铸件的绝大部分。此外，汽车制造厂过去想要求邻近的拖拉机零件制造厂供应某些机器零件，但总是商谈不妥。现在这些问题都迎刃而解了。在斯维尔德洛夫斯克州（这也是一个经济行政区），不久前成立了新塔吉尔钢铁公司。这是把过去新塔吉尔钢铁厂、古比雪夫工厂、炼焦厂、耐火砖厂以及铁矿场等七个企业联合起来组成的。在统一的公司领导下，过去各企业互不通气，互相掣肘的情况已经消失，而且还精简了管理人员。
