Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 15th: Saigon newspapers report that the lives of Overseas Chinese in South Vietnam have been severely threatened since the Ngô Đình Diệm authorities forced them to cease operations in seven types of businesses.

　　Before the end of April, nearly a thousand large and small grocery stores, 250 fabric shops, 300 old copper and iron shops, 150 firewood and charcoal shops, and 50 liquid fuel shops operated by Overseas Chinese in Saigon and Dike were ordered to close down. All 600 butcher shops and 550 fish stalls in the city were also forced to cease operations. No fewer than 100,000 Overseas Chinese were affected. Including the several thousand Overseas Chinese shops in other areas affected by the ban on business operations, up to 200,000 Overseas Chinese throughout South Vietnam will suffer. South Vietnam's economic exclusion of Overseas Chinese is also a means by which it forces Overseas Chinese to adopt South Vietnamese nationality.

    吴庭艳当局采取毒辣手段
    南越二十万华侨受害
    新华社河内15日电　西贡报纸报道，在吴庭艳当局强迫华侨停止经营七种行业以后南越华侨的生活已受到严重的威胁。
    在4月底以前，西贡、堤岸华侨经营的近千家大小杂货店、二百五十家布匹店、三百家旧铜铁店、一百五十家柴炭店和五十家液体燃料店先后被勒令关门。全市的六百家肉店和五百五十个鱼摊也全部被迫停止营业。受影响的华侨不下十万人。连同其他各地受禁止营业令影响的数千家华侨商店在内，全南越受害的华侨将达二十万人。南越在经济上排斥华侨，也是它强迫华侨入南越籍的一种手段。
