A Conversation on the "Shakuntala" Rehearsal Stage

    The famous Indian poetic drama "Shakuntala" by the world-renowned cultural figure and ancient Indian poet Kalidasa officially premiered in Beijing on May 7th.

    On April 27th, the China Youth Art Theatre invited Indian Ambassador R.K. Nehru and his wife, along with embassy staff, to watch the dress rehearsal of "Shakuntala." The following is an excerpt from the discussion after the performance:

    Ambassador R.K. Nehru asked: "Is this the first time that China has staged an Indian drama?"

    Bai Shan, the actress playing Shakuntala, said: "Yes, it is."

    Director Wu Xue immediately added: "No. According to Mr. Wu Xiaoling, when Tagore came to Beijing in 1925 to celebrate his sixtieth birthday, an Indian play was performed once in the auditorium of Peking Union Medical College Hospital; it was Tagore's play 'Chitra.' At that time, Ding Xilin, Xu Zhimo, Lin Huiyin and others participated in the performance. But that was not a public performance. In addition, the female writer Xie Bingxin also staged Tagore's plays when she was at Yenching University."

    The Ambassador's wife said: "We hope that Chinese plays can be staged in India in the future!"

    Ambassador R.K. Nehru added:
   "This play can be performed publicly. There are no technical problems, and it is very successful. The actors' performances and the sets are very good. This play has also been performed in various European countries, and people like Shakuntala very much. This performance in China not only conveys the spirit of the original 'Shakuntala,' but also has an Oriental flavor. After all, this play is performed in China, and it also has Chinese characteristics; this is reasonable.

    “沙恭达罗”排练场上的一段对话
    世界文化名人、印度古代诗人迦梨陀娑的印度著名诗剧“沙恭达罗”，5月7日起在北京正式公演了。
    4月27日，中国青年艺术剧院曾邀请印度大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和夫人及使馆人员观看“沙恭达罗”的化装连排。下面是看完戏后座谈中的一段对话：
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使问：“这是中国第一次排演印度戏剧吗？”
    扮演沙恭达罗的演员白珊说：“是的。”
    导演吴雪随即接着说：“不。据吴晓铃先生谈，1925年泰戈尔来北京，庆贺他的六十寿辰时，在协和医院的礼堂曾演过一次印度戏；演的是泰戈尔的剧本‘齐德拉’，当时，参加演出的有丁西林、徐志摩、林徽音等人。但那不是公演。另外，女作家谢冰心在燕京大学时，也曾上演过泰戈尔的戏。”
    大使夫人说：“我们希望，以后在印度也能上演中国戏！”
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使又说：
   “这个戏可以公演了，从技术上看没有什么问题，非常成功。演员的表演和布景都很好。在欧洲各国也演过这出戏，人们都很喜观沙恭达罗。这次在中国的上演，不仅传达了‘沙恭达罗’原作的精神，而且富有东方的色彩。这个戏毕竟是在中国演出，还有中国的特点；这是合理的。
