Heavy Rains and Rising Waters in Parts of the Pearl River, Min River, and Other Basins; Flood Prevention Efforts Intensified in Riverside Areas

    (Our report) Since recently, rainfall has occurred successively in parts of the Pearl River, Min River, Yangtze River, and Huai River basins, causing river levels to rise temporarily. Riverside areas have begun intensive flood prevention work.

    Since late April, Anhui Province has experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather, lasting until early May. The Dabie Mountains, riverside areas, and regions south of the Yangtze River have accumulated nearly 300 millimeters of rainfall. In Qimen, Tunxi, Guangde, and other places, rainfall has reached 350 to 400 millimeters. In early May, rainfall in the Tianmu Mountains in southern Anhui Province reached 212 millimeters. As a result, riverside embankments and low-lying areas along the Huai River have been partially affected by water accumulation.

    From May 11 to 15, the main rainfall area was in the middle and lower reaches of the North River and East River, as well as the Han River and Min River in Guangdong Province. Flood peaks appeared at Qingyuan Station on the North River and Huiyang Station on the East River, but did not exceed the guaranteed water level. Flood peaks also appeared at Chaoan Station on the Han River and Nanping Station on the Min River, exceeding the warning water level by approximately 15 centimeters. Currently, water levels at these stations have receded. On the afternoon of May 20, Guangzhou City experienced heavy rain. Within four hours, rainfall reached 150 millimeters, and water depth in the northeastern part of the city reached over one meter within three hours after the rain.

    Due to heavy rainfall in early May, the Huanggang Special District of Hubei and parts of Zhejiang Province also experienced initial mountain floods and waterlogging.

    For these rivers expected to experience flooding and areas prone to waterlogging, various localities organized laborers last year and this spring to repair dikes and construct some flood prevention and drainage projects. These projects have already played or will play a significant role in flood and waterlogging prevention. For example, flood prevention and drainage projects in the Bengbu and Fuyang Special Districts of Anhui Province have played a significant role in recent rainfall and water accumulation.

    In Guangdong Province, when water levels in the East River, North River, and Han River rose, the government immediately organized approximately 20,000 local People's Liberation Army soldiers, government officials, and laborers to patrol, repair, and reinforce dikes, mitigating the danger. During the heavy rain in Guangzhou City, residents suffered no losses due to timely rescue efforts. (Wu Baotong)

### 珠江、闽江等流域局部地区雨大水涨  沿江各地紧张防汛

    珠江、闽江等流域局部地区雨大水涨
    沿江各地紧张防汛
    本报讯　最近以来，珠江、闽江、长江、淮河流域局部地区先后降雨，河水一度上涨，沿江各地已开始了紧张的防汛工作。
    4月下旬以来，安徽省境内各地阴雨连绵，一直持续到5月上旬。大别山、沿江圩区和江南地区，累计雨量都近三百公厘。祁门、屯溪、广德等地，雨量都达到三百五十至四百公厘。5月上旬，安徽省南部的天目山降雨量达二百一十二公厘。因此，沿江圩堤及沿淮低洼地区，都局部受到积水的影响。
    从5月11日到15日，主要雨区在广东省的北江、东江中、下游及韩江、闽江一带。北江的清远站、东江的惠阳站均出现洪峰，但未超过保证水位，韩江的潮安站和闽江的南平站，也出现过洪峰，超过警戒水位五公寸左右。目前这些站水位均已回落。20日下午，广州市降了暴雨。在四小时内，降雨量达一百五十公厘，市区东北部分街道在雨后三小时内，水深一公尺多。
    湖北黄冈专区和浙江省局部地区，由于5月上旬降雨量较大，也发生了初次的山洪和内涝。
    对于这些预料中会发生汛情的河流和容易发生内涝的地区，各地早在去年和今春，就组织民工，整修了堤防，兴修了一些防涝排水工程。这些工程，对于防洪、防涝已经或将要发挥很大的作用。如安徽蚌埠、阜阳两专区最近降雨积水，防涝排水工程就发挥了很大作用。
    广东省在东江、北江、韩江水位上涨时，政府即组织了驻在当地的中国人民解放军、机关干部和民工约二万人，进行了堤防的巡守、修复、加高等工作，使险情消退。广州市暴雨时，由于及时组织抢救，居民都没受什么损失。（吴宝通）
