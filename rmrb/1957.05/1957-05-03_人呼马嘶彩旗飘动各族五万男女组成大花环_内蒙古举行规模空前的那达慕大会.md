Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 1st. Under the Yin Mountains, the grass is just turning green. The largest "Naadam" fair in history opened today in the eastern suburbs of Hohhot. People of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia are using this traditional Mongolian festival to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Autonomous Region.

The rostrum and viewing stands for today's "Naadam" fair were topped with thirteen "Aobao" (Aobao were originally stone piles used by the Mongolian people to commemorate their ancestors and heroes. In the past, the Mongolian people held Naadam fairs every time they sacrificed to Aobao). On the rostrum and viewing stands, in addition to the leaders of the Autonomous Region, led by Ulanhu, Chairman of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, were also Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian and representatives of fraternal ethnic groups, as well as the head of the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, Chimiddorj Sürenjav, and other distinguished guests.

Around the venue, 50,000 men, women, and children of Mongolian, Manchu, Daur, Korean, and other ethnic groups, their colorful ethnic costumes formed a large garland. Here, people shouted, horses neighed, and colorful flags fluttered.

At 9 a.m., the conference began. More than 600 athletes of all ethnic groups and thousands of young people of all ethnic groups walked or rode horses around the field. Among those participating in the conference's performances were Sengge, the national heavyweight wrestling champion, Buhe Aoqier, the national shooting champion, as well as female riders and shooters in their fifties and young riders of nine years old.

The wrestlers came out, using jumping movements to show the audience that they were about to prepare for the competition. They sang in ancient lyrics: "Please! Release your wrestlers!" The first programs of the conference—wrestling, archery, and martial arts performances—began simultaneously.

Wrestlers and archers from the art and sports delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic participating in the conference also participated in the performances at this time, and their superb skills received warm applause.

When the nationally renowned Inner Mongolia Equestrian Team performed and Mongolian juvenile riders raced horses, the audience's emotions became increasingly high. The ages of the young riders participating in today's horse race ranged from ten to fifteen years old. During their competition, people constantly applauded them.

Today's program ended after the motorcycle driving performance, and will continue on the 2nd and 3rd.

The "Naadam" fair, in Mongolian, is called the entertainment conference. Since the 13th century, the Mongolian people have held this conference every time they offer sacrifices and on important festivals.

    内蒙古举行规模空前的那达慕大会
    新华社呼和浩特1日电  阴山下草色初青，历史上规模最大的一次“那达慕”大会今天在呼和浩特市东郊开幕。内蒙古各族人民用这个蒙古族传统节日盛会来欢庆自治区成立十周年。
    今天的“那达慕”大会主席台和观礼台顶上耸立着十三个“敖包”（敖包原来是蒙古族人民纪念祖先、英雄的石堆，过去蒙古人民每次祭敖包时就举行那达慕大会），在主席台和观礼台上除有以内蒙古自治区主席乌兰夫为首的自治区领导人外，还有国务院副总理李先念和各兄弟民族代表，蒙古人民共和国政府代表团团长齐米德道尔吉·苏伦扎布等贵宾。
    围绕着会场的五万名蒙古、满、达呼尔、朝鲜等族的男女老幼，他们的各色民族服装组成了一个大花环。这里人呼马嘶，彩旗飘动。
    上午九时，大会开始。六百多名各族运动员和成千名各族青少年步行或骑马绕场一周。这次参加大会表演的有全国重量级摔跤第一名僧格、全国第一名射手布和敖其尔，还有五十多岁的女骑射手和九岁的少年骑手。
    摔跤手们出场了，他们向观众以跳跃的动作表示快要准备比赛了，他们用古老的歌词唱着：“请吧！把你们的摔跤手放出来吧！”大会最先的节目——摔跤、步射和武术等表演便同时开始了。
    参加大会的蒙古人民共和国艺术体育代表团的摔跤手和射手这时也参加表演，他们的高超的技术获得了热烈的掌声。
    当全国闻名的内蒙古马术队表演和蒙古族少年骑手赛马的时候，观众们的情绪越来越高。今天参加赛马的少年骑手的年龄是从十岁到十五岁，在他们进行比赛中，人们不断地向他们鼓掌。
    今天的节目在摩托车驾驶表演后结束，2日和3日继续举行。
    “那达慕”大会蒙古语称为游艺大会，蒙古民族从十三世纪起，各部落每逢祭祀和重要节日就举行这种大会。
