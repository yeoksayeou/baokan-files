    Mobilizing All Positive Factors Through Rectification
    Anhui Formulates Preliminary Rectification Plan
    Hefei Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Work Conference, attended by more than 1,000 people from both inside and outside the Party, concluded on the 20th after 16 days. Leading personnel from various sectors who participated in the meeting deeply felt the necessity of opposing bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism through the analysis of many specific matters. They not only improved their understanding but also, during the period of study and discussion, implemented the spirit of rectification, writing letters or calling their respective counties to handle contradictions among the people correctly and correct past mistakes and shortcomings.
    During the conference, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee formulated a preliminary rectification plan, which was discussed by participants from various regions, cities, and counties. Everyone unanimously agreed on the following goal: To basically eliminate disturbances, eliminate the estrangement with non-Party members, effectively improve internal relations among the people, and mobilize all positive factors through this rectification movement.
    In his concluding remarks at the conference, Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, in addition to explaining some theoretical issues, specifically addressed the seven demands made by democratic parties regarding independence, freedom, equality, supervision, development, arrangements, and participation in decision-making. Regarding participation in decision-making, he said that in the future, when party organizations at or above the county level discuss policy issues internally, relevant democratic parties and non-party figures may be invited to participate. When Party groups in government departments discuss policy issues and work issues of their respective departments, non-party personnel holding leadership positions in those units should be invited to participate. The same should be done in Party committee meetings in universities and colleges.
    Regarding the arrangement issue, he said that appropriate arrangements should be made for the two to three thousand people in the province who have not yet been arranged for work, and adjustments should also be made for those whose previous arrangements were inappropriate.
    Zeng Xisheng also expressed his views on the issue of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." He said that Anhui has not "let" and "contended" enough, and from a subjective point of view, the Provincial Party Committee's support has been insufficient. He said that in the future, leaders must vigorously support and solve difficulties in implementing this policy, hoping that the academic community will work hard, boldly create, and make achievements in a down-to-earth manner.
    Finally, when he spoke about the rectification issue, he emphasized the importance of cadres participating in physical labor and the arduous task of ensuring that both rectification and work are not delayed in the face of the old disaster wounds in Anhui that are awaiting healing and new disasters that are threatening. He called on everyone to work hard to overcome this difficulty.

    通过整风调动一切积极因素
    安徽制定初步整风计划
    本报合肥22日电　有党内外一千多人参加的安徽省委宣传工作会议，开了十六天，已于20日闭幕。参加会议的各方面领导人员，从许多具体事情的分析中，深深感到反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的必要。他们不但认识上有了提高，而且就在学习讨论期间，贯彻了整风精神，纷纷写信或打电话到县里，用正确的办法处理人民内部矛盾，纠正过去的错误和缺点。
    在会议期间，安徽省委制定了整风的初步计划，并由各地、市、县参加会议的人进行了讨论。大家一致同意这样一个努力目标：要通过这次整风运动，基本上消除闹事现象，消除和党外人士的隔阂，切实改善人民内部关系，把一切积极因素都调动起来。
    中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣在会议总结中，除对一些理论问题作了解释外，特别对民主党派人士提出的独立、自由、平等、监督、发展、安排和参与决策等七项要求作了答复。关于参与决策方面，他说，今后县以上机关党内讨论方针政策问题，都可请有关的民主党派和无党派人士参加。政府各部门党组讨论方针政策问题和本部门的工作问题时，应当邀请在该单位担任领导工作的党外人士参加。在高等学校中的党委会议，也应如此办理。
    关于安排问题，他说，要对全省在社会上还没有安排的两三千人适当安排，对过去安排不适当的，也要进行调整。
    曾希圣还对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的问题发表了意见。他说，安徽“放”“鸣”得不够，从主观原因来检查是省委支持不够。他说，今后领导上在贯彻执行这一方针方面，必须大力支持，解决困难，希望学术界努力钻研，大胆创作，脚踏实地地作出成绩来。
    最后，他说到整风问题时，强调指出干部参加体力劳动的重要意义，和在安徽老灾创伤正待医治，新灾又在威胁的情况下，做到整风和工作两不误的艰巨任务。他号召大家努力克服这一困难。
