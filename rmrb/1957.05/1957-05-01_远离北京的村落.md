    Villages Far From Beijing
    Zhu Qi
    ——“Across the summit of the祁连Qilian Mountains, stretching into Qinghai, lies a small village, seemingly a secluded place. Yet, a wired broadcasting network brings the sounds of the whole world here, banishing its silence…”
                       ——From a diary
    Good morning! “Secluded” village, good morning!
    People lying on warm kang beds
    Dawn has arrived, distant Beijing has already awakened
    Quickly drive your flocks down the mountain peaks
    A loudspeaker hangs on the stout pine on the mountain's edge
    Splitting the world open above the mountain village
    Accompanying the shepherdess's gentle singing
    Is that affectionate "The East is Red"
    Don't say you are so far away from Beijing
    The motherland's love is never stingy to anyone
    Who is it that uses that wondrous magic wire
    To tightly connect you with the motherland
  
    The smoke coiling above the “Great Khingan Range”
    Seems to rise right at your feet
    The clanging of hammers at Sanmenxia
    Seems to ring right in your ears
    On the motherland's peaceful coasts
    Fishermen can also hear your shepherd's flute
    In the south's dense coconut groves
    Doesn't the even rhythm of your camel bells also drift
    Good morning! Beijing is saying hello to you
    Good morning! The world is paying tribute to you
    You rest and work with the motherland
    You advance with the motherland

    远离北京的村落
    朱奇
    ——“翻过延伸在青海的祁连山山顶，那里有一个不大的村落，看来是一个闭塞的地方。然而有线广播网却把全世界的声音带到了这里，驱走了这里的寂静……”
                       ——摘自日记早安呀！“闭塞的”村庄早安呀！躺在热炕上的人民黎明来了，遥远的北京已经苏醒快把你的羊群赶下山峰大喇叭悬挂在山尖的劲松上把世界剖开在山村的上空伴和着牧羊女柔和的歌声是那亲切的“东方红”不要说你和北京遥遥远离祖国的爱抚对谁从不悭吝是谁把那根奇妙的仙线把你和祖国紧紧联结在一起
  “大兴安岭”上盘旋的炊烟仿佛就升起在你的脚下三门峡叮噹的锤声仿佛就响在你的耳旁在祖国风平浪静的海岸上渔民也能听到你牧人的笛音在南方浓密的椰子林里不也飘荡着你节奏均匀的驼铃早安呀！北京在向你问好早安呀！世界在向你致敬你和祖国一道作息你和祖国一道前进
