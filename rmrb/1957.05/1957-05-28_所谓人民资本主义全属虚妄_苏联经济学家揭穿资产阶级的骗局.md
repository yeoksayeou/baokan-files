Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: The May issue of "International Life" magazine, recently published, features a discussion by Soviet economists on the so-called "People's Capitalism." This discussion was organized by the editorial board of "International Life." Participants included economics professors, lecturers, corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences, international affairs experts, and others.

"People's Capitalism" is a fashionable theory recently popular in Western countries, originating in the United States. The basic arguments of this theory are: first, under current capitalist conditions, profound changes have occurred in the distribution of private property, with private property having been transferred to the masses; second, the bourgeoisie has retreated to a secondary position in managing enterprises, with leadership concentrated in the hands of those with technical and production knowledge; third, a revolution has also occurred in the distribution of national income, with workers' share of the national income increasing daily. According to this theory, modern capitalist production does not seek to obtain maximum profits, but to satisfy the needs of all members of society and improve their material well-being. Because workers have purchased a small number of shares, it seems as if every worker has become a capitalist.

Participants in the discussion exposed the myth of so-called "People's Capitalism." They argued, from the role of capital monopolies, the competition and anarchy of capitalist production, and the poverty of the working class in capitalist countries, that this theory does not correspond to the reality of capitalist countries. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that capitalist monopolies are strengthening, not decreasing, and the entire state apparatus is now in the hands of monopoly capital.

Bourgeois economists have said that the U.S. government purchases 22% of all American products, therefore the government cares about the planned production of materials, as if capitalist production in the United States can be carried out according to plan. Dr. Kotovsky, Deputy of Economic Sciences, said in a special report that this statement is completely self-deceptive. The purpose of capitalist production is to seek profit, so capitalist competition and the anarchy of production cannot be changed. Government orders and financial loans and other measures can only intensify competition and cannot eliminate the anarchy of production.

The theorists of "People's Capitalism" have said that American capitalism guarantees the continuous rise of workers' material living standards and the continuous increase of income. It seems that from 1941 to 1955, a fifteen-year period, the average wage income of each American family increased by 150%. Participants in the discussion pointed out in their speeches that in the aforementioned fifteen years, even if nominal wages increased by 150%, the cost of living in the United States increased by 134% during the same period. Actual wages only increased by 6%-7%, which means that annual wage income increased by less than 0.5%. According to official U.S. materials, there are now three million fully unemployed workers and nine million partially unemployed workers in the United States, whose lives are not improving but struggling on the brink of starvation. Corresponding Academician Smidt pointed out in his speech that an American magazine once admitted that in recent years the labor productivity of the American processing industry has increased by 10%, while wages have only increased by 7%. In the United States, a family of four needs $5,335 per year to maintain a minimum standard of living, but 10% of American families have only $1,000 in income per year, and more than half of families have income less than $4,000.

Economists at the discussion cited various materials to prove that this theory is fabricated. Everyone unanimously pointed out that the historical conditions for the emergence of "People's Capitalism" are: on the one hand, the sharpening of social, political, and economic contradictions in capitalist society; on the other hand, the world is divided into two camps, and the influence and prestige of the socialist camp are constantly growing. Therefore, the bourgeoisie created this false theory in order to deceive the people and divide the working class.

    所谓人民资本主义全属虚妄
    苏联经济学家揭穿资产阶级的骗局
    新华社莫斯科27日电　最近出版的5月份“国际生活”杂志发表了苏联经济学家对所谓“人民资本主义”的讨论。这次讨论是由“国际生活”编辑部举办的。参加讨论的有经济学教授、讲师、科学院通讯院士、国际问题专家等多人。
      “人民资本主义”是最近在西方国家流行的一种时髦理论，它的故乡是美国。这种理论的基本论点是：第一，在目前资本主义条件下，私有财产的分配发生了深刻的变化，私有财产已经转入到人民群众手里；第二，资产阶级在管理企业方面已经退居次要地位，领导权已经集中到技术生产知识界手中；第三，在国民收入的分配方面也发生了革命，工人在国民收入中所占的比重日益增加。根据这种理论，好像现代资本主义生产不是想获得最大限度的利润，而是要满足社会各个成员的需要和提高其物质福利，由于有工人购买了少量股票，好像每个工人都成了资本家。
    讨论会的参加者揭露了所谓“人民资本主义”的神话，他们从资本垄断的作用、资本主义生产的竞争和无政府状态，从资本主义国家工人阶级的贫困等各个方面论证了这种理论不符合于资本主义国家的现实。他们在发言中一致指出，资本主义的垄断是在加强，而不是减少，全套国家机器现在都操在垄断资本的手中。
    资产阶级的经济学家们曾说，美国政府收购美国全部生产品的22％，因此政府关心物资的计划生产，好像美国的资本主义生产可以按计划进行。经济学副博士科托夫斯基在专题报告中说，这种说法完全是自欺欺人，资本主义生产的目的是为了谋取利润，因此资本主义竞争和生产无政府状态是无法改变的，政府订货和财政贷款等措施只能使竞争加剧，无法消除生产的无政府状态。
    “人民资本主义”的理论宣传家们曾说，美国的资本主义保证工人物质生活水平不断上升，收入不断增加，好像从1941—1955年十五年期间，美国每个家庭工资收入平均增加了150％。讨论会的参加者在发言中指出，在上述十五年间，即令名义工资提高了150％，而美国的生活费用在同时期提高了134％，实际工资只提高了6％—7％，就是说每年工资收入提高不到0.5％。根据美国官方材料，现在美国有三百万全失业的工人，九百万半失业的工人，他们的生活不是提高，而是挣扎在饥饿线上。通讯院士斯米特在发言中指出，一个美国杂志曾经承认，近年来美国加工工业劳动生产率提高了10％，而工资只增加了7％，在美国，一个四口之家每年需要五千三百三十五美元才能维持最低生活水平，可是美国10％的家庭每年只有一千美元的收入，过半数的家庭的收入少于四千美元。
    经济学家在讨论会上列举了各种材料，证明这种理论是捏造的。大家一致指出，“人民资本主义”产生的历史条件是：一方面，资本主义社会、政治、经济矛盾尖锐化，另一方面，世界分化成为两个阵营，社会主义阵营的影响和威信不断增长。因此，资产阶级为了欺骗人民、分化工人阶级才制造出这种虚伪的理论。
