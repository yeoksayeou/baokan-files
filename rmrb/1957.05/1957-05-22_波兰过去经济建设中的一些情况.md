Some Situations in Poland's Past Economic Construction

Editor's Note: This article, originally titled "Past Achievements and Mistakes," was published in the "People's Tribune," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, on April 14. It provides a relatively general account of the achievements and some of the problems that occurred in Poland's economic construction in the post-war period. We are now publishing an excerpt here.

In the entire discussion on improving economic policies, we would like to briefly talk about the achievements and mistakes of the past. There are people both domestically and within the Party who want to completely negate the achievements of the past. If we were to believe them, we would lose confidence in the future. Because they say that what we built was not the foundation of socialism but some meaningless and unsolid "pictures." Of course, if someone wants to evaluate the past in this way, that is their prerogative, but it should be pointed out that this evaluation is incorrect. It fails to see the fact that millions of people, under the call and leadership of the Party, built our new economy on the ruins of war.

Some say that our living standards are lower than those of advanced capitalist countries. This is a fact. At the same time, the Party has never denied this fact.

Here are some materials, comparing the situation in Poland, West Germany, France, and Italy:

　　　　　Electricity Steel
Pre-war Production Current Production Index Pre-war Production Current Production Index
(100 million kWh) (100 million kWh) (10,000 tons) (10,000 tons)
Poland　 3.6 billion kWh　 19.5 billion kWh　 542%　 150 500 333%
West Germany 31.1 billion kWh 85.3 billion kWh 274% 1790 2260 126%
France　 20.0 billion kWh 54.3 billion kWh　 272%　 790 1340 170%
Italy 15.4 billion kWh 39.8 billion kWh　 250%　 210 590 281%

　　　　　Cotton Yarn Sugar
Pre-war Production Current Production Index Pre-war Production Current Production Index
(1,000 tons) (1,000 tons) (1,000 tons) (1,000 tons)
Poland 78 116 149% 562 1090 Nearly doubled
West Germany 276 396 143% －－ －－ －－
France 250 283 113% 969 1519 157%
Italy 140 155 111% 352 780 222%

The result of our efforts has been to narrow, but not yet eliminate, the distance between us and these capitalist countries. This is due to the backwardness of our economy before the war, the destruction during the war, and the hindrance to development. It will take enormous effort to pay off the historical debt. Now let's look at the changes in consumer goods, calculated by per capita annual consumption:

　　　　Meat Fat Sugar
Pre-war Consumption Current Consumption Pre-war Consumption Current Consumption Pre-war Consumption Current Consumption
Poland 19.6 kg 32.9 kg 8.3 kg 12.8 kg 9.6 kg 24 kg
West Germany 53 kg 46 kg 21 kg 24 kg 26 kg 26 kg
France 61 kg 72 kg 14 kg 14 kg 24 kg 29 kg
Italy 20 kg 19 kg 12 kg 12 kg 7 kg 16 kg

The above data is excerpted from the United Nations' Yearbook of Agriculture and Food and the Polish Statistical Yearbook (1956). It can be seen that due to the low pre-war level, we have not yet caught up with West Germany and France, but we have overtaken Italy.

In this way, the past period was not a standstill. Although many opportunities were missed and some losses were not avoided, the past period was still a period of rapid development.

This is a comprehensive assessment of the past period. No one can take away the historical achievements of the Polish communists in the industrialization of the country and the reconstruction of the country from the ruins, and no one can deny that it is precisely because of them that our industry has quadrupled, and the number of our working class has doubled, and has become the advanced force of the people.

We should never forget the significance of the Polish people's struggle for the new system. But this does not mean that we can condemn the critical evaluation of the past period. Under the correct economic policies, even better results could have been achieved. If less could have been spent on investment and defense between 1950 and 1953; if the expansion of heavy industry could have been slightly slower, and the funds saved from this could have been used in light industry; if a more perfect agricultural policy had been adopted; if less waste had occurred in production and investment, then tens of billions of zlotys could have been spent on consumption. Building fewer new factories and spending more money on innovation might have better equipped our industry with modern technology, and perhaps the quality of many commodities would have been better, and the variety would have been greater. All this could have been achieved if more attention had been paid to these issues and resolutely fought for them at that time.

It was not the general direction of our economic transformation that was wrong, but the speed of transformation in many aspects and the excessive reliance on force as a means of achieving transformation. It was not wrong that we quickly built the foundation of socialism, but that we did not consult with the working masses in this process, and as a result, the proportion of national income used for accumulation and consumption could not satisfy the people. Because the people hoped to significantly improve their lives.

The fundamental reason for this detachment from the masses in the economy was the over-centralization of work in the Party and economic organs (this method was still necessary at first, but later it became excessive). Over-centralization created a huge institution, and bureaucracy inevitably arose from its pile of regulations; at the same time, it divorced economic decisions from the direct and effective supervision of the masses. Since everything was decided by the higher levels, the local Party organizations gradually lost their initiative; it also made these Party organizations lose their characteristics as political leaders of the masses. Some local Party organizations were completely detached from the masses. As a result, the masses did not understand the Party's policies, and the Party could no longer hear the opinions of the masses.

The organs of economic activity were even more serious. The higher levels led the lower levels through thousands of regulations. The lower levels no longer thought for themselves and gradually became machines to complete the orders of the higher levels. In this way, even if the instructions of the higher levels were correct, they would become harmful. In this way, the higher levels slowly became a small group of people who did not know the actual situation below in the hearts of the workers. In addition to the disproportion of the plan, the great shortcomings of the past period also included excessive and bureaucratic centralization and sectarian factors. Everyone agrees on this point.

The real problem is not the existence of administrative organs, but its excessive expansion, which affects the income of producers. What is bad is the lack of effective supervision of these organs by the masses.

In the socialist economy, democratic centralism is absolutely indispensable. This is also where it is superior to the capitalist system. There is no socialism without a national economic plan. Here, without the state's management of the production that constitutes the lifeblood of the national economy, it would be impossible to link the activities of thousands of enterprises into a whole. If the state does not control the production of these enterprises and does not give them instructions on the size of production, there will be no plan. At that time, the state will speculate and study the market like in capitalist countries; it will use tariffs, taxes, and credit policies to indirectly affect production, and even partially adopt price policies to affect production. At that time, the plan will not be able to promote and regulate economic development.

The planned economy associated with the socialization of the means of production is the great historical achievement of our people and the fundamental factor ensuring the rapid development of our economy in a manner suitable to social requirements. It is on this basis that those who demand that the ownership by the whole people be changed into the collective ownership by employees or leased by the state to the employees of state-owned factories are wrong.

The form of ownership by the whole people of the basic means of production is, and must be, the foundation of our socialist economy. And this form requires the state to centrally manage these materials.

### 波兰过去经济建设中的一些情况

    波兰过去经济建设中的一些情况
    编者按：这篇文章原题为“过去的成就和错误”，登载在4月14日的波兰统一工人党中央机关报“人民论坛报”上，它对波兰战后时期经济建设的成就和曾经发生过的一些问题作了比较概括的说明。现在摘要发表在这里。
    在整个关于改善经济政策的讨论中，我们想略微谈谈过去时期的成就和错误。在国内和党内都有人想完全否定过去时期的成绩，假如相信他们的话，我们将对未来失去信心。因为他们说我们建成的不是社会主义的基础而是一些毫无实际意义、毫不巩固的“画片”。当然，如果有人愿意这样来估计过去那也是可以的，只不过应指出，这种估计是不正确的。他没有看到几百万人在党的号召下，在党的领导下，在战争的废墟上建立起来了我们的新经济的这样一个事实。
    有人说我们的生活水平比先进资本主义国家要低。这是事实。同时党从来也没有否认过这个事实。
    这里引证一些材料，就波兰、西德、法国、意大利的情况进行一下比较：
          电力钢
    战前生产量　目前生产量　指标　  战前产量　目前产量 　指标
                                   （单位万吨）　（单位万吨）波兰　   36亿度　  195亿度　  542％　   150   　500　    333％西德   311亿度　 853亿度　  274％　  1790  　2260　    126％法国　 200亿度 　543亿度　  272％　  790　  1340　     170％意大利 154亿度 　398亿度　  250％　  210　  590      　281％
          棉纱糖
        战前产量　目前产量　指标　战前产量　目前产量　指标
      （单位千吨）　（单位千吨）　（单位千吨）　（单位千吨）波兰　    78　     116　    149％　 562    　1090  　近两倍西　德　  276　    396　    143％　－－    　－－  　－－法　国　  250　    283　    113％ 　969    　1519  　157％意大利　  140　    155　    111％　 352    　780   　222％
    我们的努力的结果，缩小了，但还不能勾消我们和这些资本主义国家的距离。这是由于战前我国经济的落后，战争时期的破坏和对发展的阻碍，要想勾掉历史的欠债还需要付出巨大的努力。现在再看看消费品的改变，按每人每年的消费量计算：
      肉类                   脂肪                    糖
   战前消费量　目前消费量　战前消费量　目前消费量　战前消费量　目前消费量波兰　19.6公斤　32.9公斤   　8.3公斤    　12.8公斤   9.6公斤　    24公斤西德　53公斤　   46公斤　     21公斤　    24公斤    　26公斤    　26公斤法国  61公斤　   72公斤　     14公斤    　14公斤    　24公斤　    29公斤意大利　20公斤　   19公斤　     12公斤    　12公斤    　7公斤　     16公斤
    上面的材料是根据联合国所发表的农业、粮食年鉴和波兰的统计年鉴（1956）摘录的。可以看出，由于战前的水平低，我们现在还没能赶过西德和法国，但我们已赶过了意大利。
    这样说来，过去时期就不是停顿，尽管放过了许多可能利用的东西，没有避免掉一些损失，但过去时期还是飞速发展的时期。
    这是对过去时期的全面估计。谁也不能夺去波兰共产党员们在国家工业化和从废墟上重建国家的工作中的历史功勋，谁也不能否认正是由于他们，我国的工业才提高四倍，我国的工人阶级人数也增加了一倍，并成为人民的先进力量。
    应该永远不要忘记波兰人民为新制度而进行的斗争的意义。但这也不意味着说我们就可以谴责对过去时期批判性的估价。在正确的经济政策下可以得到比这更好一些的结果。如果在1950—1953年间能够在投资和国防上用得略少一些；扩建重工业的速度稍慢一点，并把由此而节约出来的资金用在轻工业上；采取更完善的农业政策；在生产中和投资中浪费更少一些的话，那么一定可以多有几十亿兹罗提来花在消费上。少建一些新工厂，多用点钱来搞革新化，也许可以更好地把我们的工业用近代化的技术装备起来，也许许多商品的质量会更好一些，品种也许会多一些，假如当时更多地注意这些问题，并坚决地为此而斗争时这一切都会得到。
    错的并不是我们经济变革的总方向，而是在许多方面变革的速度以及过多地依靠强力作为实现变革的手段。错的并不是我们很快地建成了社会主义的基础，而是我们没有在这过程中和劳动群众商量，结果国民收入用于积累和消费的比例就不能使人民满意。因为人民希望能够显著地提高生活。
    在经济上造成这种脱离群众的根本原因是党和经济机关工作中的过度集中（这种方法在最初还是必须的，但后来就成了过火的了）。过度集中造成了机构庞大，从其条例堆中，不可避免地产生了官僚主义；同时也使经济决定脱离了群众的直接的、有效的监督。由于一切由上级决定，地方党组织渐渐地失去了活动的积极性；也就使这些党的组织失去了自己作为群众政治领袖的特点。有些地方党组织完全脱离了群众。结果群众不了解党的政策，而党再也听不到群众的意见。
    经济活动的机关更严重，上级通过千万个条例来领导下级，下级不再自己思索了，逐渐变成了完成上级命令的机器。这样即使上级的指示是正确的也会变成有害的东西。这样上级就在工人群众的心里慢慢地变成了一小撮不知下面实际情况的人。过去时期的大缺点除了计划的失却比例外还有过度的、官僚化的集中制和宗派主义的因素。这一点大家都同意。
    真正的不好，并不是行政机关的存在，而是它的过度膨胀，影响生产者的收入。坏的是缺乏群众对这些机关的有效监督。
    在社会主义经济中，民主集中制是绝对不可缺少的。这也正是它比资本主义制度优越的地方，没有全国的经济计划就没有社会主义。在我们这里，如果没有国家对构成国家经济命脉的生产的管理，就不可能使成千成万个企业的活动联结成一个整体。假如国家不掌握这些企业的生产，不给他们指示出生产的大小，那就不会有计划。那时国家就会像在资本主义国家里一样，进行推测，研究行情；将用关税、税收、信贷政策等手段来间接地影响生产，甚至部分地还要采用价格政策来影响生产。那时计划将不能起促进和调节经济发展的作用。
    与生产资料公有化有关联的计划经济，是我国人民伟大的历史成就，是保证我国经济在适合社会要求的情况下迅速发展的根本因素。正是根据这个，那些要求把全民所有制变为职工集体所有制或由国家出租给国营工厂职工的说法是错误的。
    基本生产资料的全民所有制形式是、也必须是我国社会主义经济的基础。而这种形式就要求国家集中管理这些资料。
