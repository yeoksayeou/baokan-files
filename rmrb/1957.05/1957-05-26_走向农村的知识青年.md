Intellectual Youths Marching Towards the Countryside
Dai Yue
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Shijingshan District, Beijing, was established in December 1955. Currently, the cooperative has more than fifty junior and senior primary school graduates. During the labor process, they have not only improved their production skills, but also their political and ideological awareness has significantly increased. Among the sixteen youths in the orchard team, three have become probationary members of the Chinese Communist Party.
    
    Students of Michurin
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative plans to plant 1,500 mu of fruit trees within seven years. Although the number is not large, it is a daunting task for this cooperative which has never engaged in fruit tree cultivation. The cooperative entrusted this task to sixteen intellectual youths. Cultivating fruit trees was still unfamiliar to these youths, but they learned from each other, helped each other, and overcame difficulties. For example, everyone was unsure how to start with the "bud grafting" of fruit trees. Zhang Yongping, the leader of the orchard team, led everyone to the willow forest to experiment with willow branches. As a result, they successfully tested a "bud grafting" method, and the survival rate of the "bud grafted" fruit trees reached over 70%. Through their efforts, they planted 400 mu of fruit trees in the first year, and this year they have already planted 1,000 mu. These middle and primary school graduates bought many books on fruit tree cultivation and management to improve their management level, and some people are also studying Michurin's theory.
    
    Promoting New Agricultural Technologies
    These intellectual youths have more easily learned new technologies such as cotton planting, close planting of corn, wheat seed soaking, artificial pollination of corn, and so on. During the spring plowing season, the youth production team adopted the method of close planting to sow cotton, and the average yield per mu was 52 jin higher than that of ordinary cotton fields, which was praised by the cooperative. When the corn was flowering and heading, they also organized middle school students who were home for summer vacation to help with artificial pollination. Artificial pollination was carried out on 20 mu extracted from a large cornfield, and in autumn, the cobs were full of kernels. Many old farmers saw it and admired them, saying: "New experiences are accurate with every trial, and old people also have to learn new technologies." Due to the active leadership of the intellectual youths, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative quickly promoted various advanced technologies.
    
    Learning from Old Farmers
    The intellectual youths also humbly learned from the old farmers. When they first started participating in agricultural production, they were very unskilled. When hoeing, they were afraid of not being able to exert their strength, so they gripped the hoe handles tightly, and their hands were covered with blisters after hoeing for a day. When the old farmers saw this, they patiently taught them the method of using the hoe and helped them learn how to hoe. They also encountered many difficulties when plowing. The livestock could not understand their shouts and jumped around, and the plowed land looked like a three-year-old child's drawing, crooked and winding. However, they were not discouraged, actively consulted with the old farmers, and practiced picking up the plow to practice when they were resting from plowing.
    
    Uniting Youths and Settling Down for Production
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative is near Babaoshan and Laoshan, where there are some industrial production needs such as flint, red soil, and white sand raw materials for making oil felt paper - white stone, etc. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative organized the people in the cooperative to engage in this sideline, which is of great benefit to developing production and increasing the income of the members. However, last year, some of the youths in the white sand production team were not settled down for production. Some wanted to enter factories, and some wanted to go to the city to attend cram schools. Because of the needs of production, the cooperative refused to let them go, and some people became emotional. After Zhou Deyi, a junior high school graduate, was transferred to work in the white sand production team, he studied methods with the captain, persuaded and educated those who were not settled down for production, and improved the production methods. The quality of the products was improved, and the output increased from more than 4,000 jin of white sand produced in the past eight hours to more than 5,000 jin. The cooperative cadres praised: "The youth group is really capable!"
    
    Producing and Learning Simultaneously
    In the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative, intellectual youths can be seen working happily everywhere. In addition to directly participating in agricultural production, these intellectual youths also hold various jobs - accountants, civil school teachers, credit cooperative cadres, nursery workers, and broadcasters.
    They all gained pleasure in various different labors, and labor also created a happy life for themselves. Because everyone worked well, the cooperative increased production year after year. In 1956, the cooperative also established a spare-time middle school and a spare-time primary school, and they are all continuing to study. Some said: "We produce and learn at the same time, and we will build the countryside even more beautifully!" (Attached pictures)

    Liu Yanming (left), a senior primary school graduate, has now initially mastered general agricultural production techniques.
    Zhang Yongping (right), the leader of the orchard team, and primary school graduates participating in production study the development of pear trees.
    When watering vegetables, the watering should be even, and the depth of the water should also be appropriate. Liu Huaiqing is learning from an old farmer how to modify the ridges when watering Chinese cabbage.
    Zhou Deyi (left) came to the white sand production team and worked with everyone to find ways to overcome difficulties, increasing output by more than double. This is their improved method of threshing.
    They - the intellectual youths gained pleasure in rural labor and realized that it is glorious to be the first generation of cultured farmers.

    走向农村的知识青年
    戴月
    北京市石景山区中苏友好农业社，是在1955年12月成立的。现在，这个社有五十多名初中、高小毕业生。他们在劳动过程当中不仅提高了生产技能，而且政治思想觉悟也有了显著的提高，在果树队的十六名青年中，已经有三人成为中国共产党的预备党员。
    米丘林的学生
    中苏友好农业社计划在七年内种植果树一千五百亩。数字虽然不算大，可是，对这个从来没经营过果树的社来说却是个艰巨的任务。社里把这项任务交给了十六名知识青年。栽培果树，对于这些青年来说，还是生疏的，但是他们互相学习，互相帮助，克服了困难。例如果树“芽接”工作，大家都不知道从何作起。果树组长张永平就领着大家到柳条林去用柳条作试验，结果试验成功了一种“芽接”方法，“芽接”的果树成活率达到70％以上。经过他们的努力，第一年就种植了果树四百亩，今年已经植果树一千亩。这些中小学毕业生，为了提高经营管理水平，买了许多果树栽培和经营管理方面的书籍来学习，有的人还在学习米丘林学说。
    推广农业新技术
    这些知识青年，比较容易地学会了种棉花，玉米密植，小麦浸种，玉米人工授粉……等等新的技术。在春耕的时候，青年生产队采用密植的方法播种的棉花，每亩地平均比一般棉田增产五十二斤，得到了社里的表扬。在玉米开花结穗的时候，他们还组织了回家过暑假的中学生帮助进行人工授粉。在一大片玉米地中间抽出二十亩进行了人工授粉，到了秋天，棒子上都长着满满的籽粒。许多老农民看到了，很佩服地说：新经验一试一个准，老年人也得学习新技术了。由于知识青年的积极带头，中苏友好社很快地推广了各种先进技术。
    向老农民学习
    知识青年们也很虚心向老农民学习，他们开始参加农业生产的时候，干活很不熟练，锄地时怕使不上劲，把锄把攥得紧紧的，锄了一天地就磨得满手是泡。老农民看到这种情形，就耐心教他们用锄的方法，帮助他们学会了锄地。他们犁地的时候，也遇到很多困难，牲口听不懂他们的吆喝，使用起来乱蹦乱跳，犁出来的地就像三岁小孩子画的线一样，弯弯曲曲。但是他们并不灰心，积极向老农民请教，并且在犁地歇息的时候，就拿起犁来练习。
    团结青年安心生产
    中苏友好社临近八宝山、老山，那里有一些工业生产上需要的东西，如火石、红土、作油毡纸用的白砂原料——白石等。中苏友好社组织社里的人从事这种副业，对于发展生产和增加社员收入都有很大好处。可是去年白砂生产队的青年当中有一部分人不安心生产，他们有的想进工厂，有的想进城上补习班。因为生产需要，社里不肯放他们走，有的人就闹情绪。初中毕业生周德义调到白砂生产队工作以后，他同队长一起研究办法，对不安心生产的人进行说服教育，并且改进了生产方法，产品质量提高了，产量由过去的八小时生产四千多斤白砂提高到五千多斤。社干部称赞说：青年小组真能干！
    一面生产，一面学习
    在中苏友好社里，到处可以看到知识青年们在愉快地劳动着。这些知识青年除了直接参加农业生产以外，还担任着各种工作——会计、民校教师、信用社干部、保育员和广播员。
    他们都在各种不同的劳动中获得了乐趣，劳动也给他们自己创造了幸福的生活。由于大家劳动好，社里连年增产。1956年合作社里还办了一所业余中学和一所业余小学，他们都在继续学习。有的说：我们一面生产，一面学习，要把农村建设得更加美好！（附图片）
    高小毕业生刘延明（左）现在已经初步掌握了一般的农业生产技术。
    果树组长张永平（右）和参加生产的高小毕业生研究梨树发育的情况。
    浇菜要浇得匀，水的深浅也要合适。刘怀庆正向老农学习浇白菜时的改畦工作。
    周德义（左）到了白砂生产队，和大家一起想办法克服困难，使产量提高了一倍多。这是他们改进的打碾子的办法。
    他们——知识青年在农村的劳动中获得了乐趣，体会到做第一代有文化的农民是光荣的。
