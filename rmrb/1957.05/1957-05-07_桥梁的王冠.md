Title: The Crown of the Bridge

The vermillion bridge body disappears into the night,
Using the lights as inlaid silver threads.
It transforms into a picturesque long corridor,
The evening dress of the Yangtze River Bridge.

The lights in the sky resemble two ribbons of rainbow colors,
The masts of ten-thousand-ton ships cannot touch its edges.
And the reflections of the lights in the water,
Seem to compete with the stars in the sky for brightness.

If it weren't for the Jiangshan in our own hands,
Who would be so diligently dressing it up?
Good night! You who operate in the starry sky,
Those are all stars you've salvaged from the waves.

Look, each light is a rare flower
Rooted in the bedrock,
Blooming for the first time in the Jiangtian of Asia.

Look, each light forms a dense garland,
Adorning the unparalleled crown of the bridge.
Bless you, bridge lights—
So many smiling eyes,

As if lining up to welcome the trains of the motherland,
Safely crossing here.
And the bridge's smile will attract friends from beyond the sky,
Will attract future generations,
Paying tribute with fantastical gazes.

    桥梁的王冠
    吴视朱红的桥身在夜色中消隐把灯光当作镶边的银线它就变成了画面似的长廊那便是长江大桥的晚装横空的灯光宛似双条彩带万吨船舶的桅杆摸不到它的边缘而那映在水波中的灯影也好像要和天上的繁星争明如果不是自己手上的江山谁肯这么殷勤地打扮晚安！在星空操作的人们那都是你们从浪涛中捞取的星星看哪，朵朵灯光是从岩层生根的奇葩第一次开放在亚洲的江天云上看哪，朵朵灯光结成了茂密的花环装点着绝世无双的桥梁的王冠祝福你桥灯——这么多含笑的眼睛好似排队欢迎祖国的列车从这里平安过渡而大桥的笑容将吸引天外的友人将吸引后代子孙以奇幻的目光致敬
