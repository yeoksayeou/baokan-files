Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 17th: The Finnish government crisis, which lasted for three weeks, ended on May 16th. Prime Minister Fagerholm met with the President of the Republic and reported to him that the government had decided to withdraw its resignation.

The government crisis was caused by a severe split within the Social Democratic Party, one of the main ruling parties.

Prime Minister Fagerholm told the Finnish News Agency that the reasons that originally prompted the Social Democratic ministers in the government and subsequently the entire government to resign have now been eliminated.

    据新华社17日讯　赫尔辛基消息：延续了三个星期的芬兰政府危机，在5月16日结束。法格霍姆总理谒见了共和国总统，向他报告政府已决定收回辞呈。
    这次政府危机是由于主要执政党之一社会民主党内部的严重分裂而引起的。
