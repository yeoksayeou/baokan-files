    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th - According to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, the Arab League Petroleum Committee, which recently held a meeting in Cairo, has recommended that member state governments prohibit oil produced in Arab League countries from being transported through non-Arab League countries.
    The newspaper pointed out that this recommendation was made due to Western plans to transport oil through the territories of non-Arab League countries.

    阿拉伯联盟石油委员会
    反对西方通过非联盟国运走石油
    新华社开罗20日电　据“金字塔报”报道，最近在开罗举行会议的阿拉伯联盟石油委员会，已经建议会员国政府禁止阿拉伯联盟国家出产的石油通过非阿拉伯联盟国家运出。
    这家报纸指出，这项建议是由于西方计划通过非阿拉伯联盟国家的领土运出石油而提出的。
    西方的一些大石油公司最近在伦敦举行会议，讨论建筑一条通过土耳其的油管，以便把伊拉克出产的石油运出。
