    The Long Night of Taiwanese Intellectuals	　Gu Fan
    Summer Cold and Winter Heart
    Enduring spring's cold, then summer's chill,
    An icy heart is hard to warm still.
    A poet residing in Taiwan wrote a poem titled "Summer Cold," and these are the opening two lines. What floods the Taiwanese "literary scene" are materials depicting adultery, depravity, and thievery that numb and poison people's minds, as well as monotonous "anti-communist clichés." However, some pieces reflect the sorrow, shivers, worries, resentment, and despair of Taiwanese intellectuals in the long night; "Summer Cold" is one such work. A bi-monthly publication in Taipei published an essay titled "Winter Heart Grass," and the author's "winter heart" serves as a commentary on the summer cold mindset of Taiwanese intellectuals. The article states that in Taiwan, winter is invisible. The plains never see snow or ice; there are no stoves, and no need for fur coats. Even after the winter solstice, the gardens and plants remain eternally green. If the face of winter should be bleak, stark, withered, and desolate, then Taiwan is a place without winter. However, while the natural phenomena are such, the feelings in the hearts of Taiwanese are not the same. Their hearts may forever be in winter. They suffer from an incurable melancholy, deeply trapped in the insistence that "spring is not my spring," and buried by sadness.
    Such writing, full of sorrowful sentiment, is ubiquitous in Taiwanese literary works. A Taiwanese author describes Taiwanese intellectuals as "night walkers," who experience "boundless loneliness in the vast long night."
    In a Cultural Wasteland
    In Taiwan, the lack of books to read is one of the reasons why intellectuals there feel boundless loneliness. A Taiwanese who once studied in France said that in recent years, the cultural circles in Taiwan can be said to have reached the point of extreme famine. Today, the list of banned books in Taiwan is truly as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, impossible to count.
    Over the past few years, the Taiwanese Kuomintang authorities have compiled many lists of banned books and have frequently sent teams to bookstores, institutions, schools, and libraries to seal off and burn banned books.
    These banned books even include "Steam Tables and Mollier Charts" translated by Liu Xianzou, "Theoretical Chemistry Experiments" written by Zhang Jiangshu, "Science and the History of the Development of Scientific Thought" translated by Ren Hongjun and others, "A General History of China" written by Lü Simian, as well as "General Physics," "Fertilizer Science," "Weaving Composition," "Rice Cultivation," "Rice Pest Science," "Practical Leather Making," "Inorganic Chemistry General Theory," "Practical Chemistry," "Physical Geography," "English Grammar," and translations of Shakespeare's plays, translations of famous literary works from various Western European countries, all the way to the Ciyuan and Cihai dictionaries…
    The Taiwanese Kuomintang authorities have compiled many lists of banned books in recent years. One of them alone listed the names of over a thousand people in academic and literary circles, including Liang Shuming, Shen Congwen, Zhu Guangqian, Yan Jici, Li Jinxi, and Shu Xincheng, stipulating that all publications by these people residing on the mainland, whether authored, edited, or translated, should be banned. The Cihai and Ciyuan dictionaries were banned in Taiwan because most of the editors of these two dictionaries remained on the mainland.
    Taiwanese intellectuals live as if in a cultural desert, with bookstores and libraries becoming vacuums.
    Taiwanese literary and art workers have no books to read, and it is even more difficult to create. Under the Kuomintang's reactionary and ignorant policies, from writers to actors, their works and performances must not only carefully avoid many "taboos" but also have fixed "anti-communist clichés" as their themes, rigid formats, and even use monotonous vocabulary; otherwise, they cannot pass the scrutiny of the Kuomintang censors. Therefore, many self-respecting academic and literary workers in Taiwan have put down their pens in recent years. On Taiwan's newsstands, in addition to being filled with American pictorials, comic books, etc., there is a batch of absurd and inferior goods produced by so-called "cultural figures" who are actually hooligans and rascals.
    Unemployment and Poverty
    The majority of Taiwanese intellectuals also live on the edge of material starvation.
    An old university professor's monthly salary is less than 1,000 Taiwan dollars (1,000 Taiwan dollars is equivalent to 25 US dollars). This standard of treatment was established three and a half years ago. In the three and a half years since then, prices in Taiwan have risen more than threefold, but professors' salaries have not changed.
    Many professors in Taiwan's universities and colleges have to help their wives buy groceries, cook, carry children, and wash diapers after class… because hiring a worker or asking for a nanny costs 300 to 400 Taiwan dollars a month in wages and food expenses, which accounts for about one-third of the old professor's monthly salary.
    As for a middle school teacher with eight to ten years of teaching experience, they only earn about 500 Taiwan dollars a month. Many teachers, in order to support their families, tutor students outside of class and do not rest on Sundays in order to earn more money to prevent their children from crying from hunger all day long. Many teachers suffer from lung disease or other chronic illnesses due to overwork, malnutrition, and depression.
    However, those intellectuals who can find employment are fortunate compared to the unemployed. Taiwan is surging with waves of unemployment. Among the more than one million unemployed people, many are intellectuals. In September of last year, the Taiwan authorities held an "employment examination." More than 2,800 newly graduated college students participated in this examination, but only over 900 were admitted. The remaining 1,900 people entered the ranks of the unemployed immediately after leaving university. And so-called "admission to employment," regardless of whether one studied electrical engineering or animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, mostly just involves being sent to various agencies in Taiwan as a "temporary employee." It is no longer news that unemployed engineering technicians in Taiwan are riding tricycles and working as peddlers.
    Mental Pressure
    The thirst for cultural life and the hardship of material life are only two aspects that make Taiwanese intellectuals feel stifled. What gives them great pressure in spirit is Taiwan's secret agent terror and the terrible social atmosphere formed under the Kuomintang's dark rule.
    In the Green Island concentration camp and in various prisons in Taiwan, tens of thousands of intellectuals are charged with crimes such as "committing treasonous criminal offenses" and being "ideological suspects," and are subjected to inhumane mental and physical torture. The Kuomintang's secret agents have become so rampant that they often enter the editorial departments of Taiwan's newspapers and magazines, questioning reporters and editors: "Who told you to write this way? Who told you to publish that news?" As for the secret reports and slanders of secret agents and Kuomintang members, they have become commonplace in Taiwan.
    A Taiwan magazine published a miscellaneous essay titled "Atmosphere of Murder," which described Taiwan's secret agent terror and a terrible social atmosphere. It said:
   "In today's Taiwanese society, in all its forms, it seems that an atmosphere of murder is permeating among the masses. People are scheming against each other, using all means. You defend and I attack, you strike and I retaliate. Grievances and resentments can be heard everywhere; rumors and whispers can be seen everywhere. It can be said that everyone is troubled by this adverse current, either dealing with investigations or guarding against informers. You live your life with trepidation every day, but disputes still follow one after another. Why has this atmosphere of murder been created in today's society? In a word, it is because there is no way out spiritually, and the island's cramped situation has created narrow-mindedness in people's hearts..."
    If the mental pressure given to people by Taiwan's secret agent terror and this terrible social atmosphere is not taken into account, then why is there such a shocking phenomenon of more than 100,000 mentally disturbed people in Taiwan, which has a population of nine million? It is difficult to obtain a more comprehensive answer.
    They Yearn for the Mainland
    Despite the best efforts of the United States and the Kuomintang authorities to spread rumors and slanders about the situation on the Chinese mainland, causing Taiwanese intellectuals to have doubts about the new China, they clearly know that China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has shaken off the situation of being invaded by imperialism for a century, and has turned from weak to strong. Western journalists have reported more than once that in Taiwan, one can strongly feel that the Taiwanese Chinese people are proud in their hearts that they have a strong motherland. Whether they are intellectuals who were born and raised in Taiwan or intellectuals who went to Taiwan from the mainland before liberation, as long as they are patriotic, they have a ray of light shining into their hearts during the long night of their lives. They yearn for their motherland, which they have not fully understood the truth about, but already know is indeed strong. Many people risk listening to Beijing radio broadcasts.
    This spring, someone in Taiwan filled out a "Good Things Nearing" poem:
   "Why so reserved,
   Across the clouds and mountains, layer upon layer,
   Only seeing a myriad words,
   In those brimming eyelashes.
   Tears are secretly shed after the song at the banquet,
   Grief rises on the eyebrows and cheeks,
   There is no Imperial Bridge flowing water,
   How to inscribe a poem on red leaves?"
    After this poem, which seems to be about the feelings of young lovers, was published, it was circulated among some intellectual circles in Taiwan for a while. Hong Kong newspapers said that this is really a reflection of the Taiwanese intellectuals' desire for peaceful liberation of Taiwan, because this poem was published at a time when our government's policy of striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan was spreading in Taiwan. "Tears are secretly shed after the song at the banquet, Grief rises on the eyebrows and cheeks," is exactly a portrayal of the Taiwan authorities relying on the American aggressors to maintain the remaining situation, being greatly humiliated, obeying others, and ingratiating themselves.
    The night is not over, the leak is not exhausted, and the Taiwanese compatriots have not yet passed through the long, dark night of miserable wind and rain. Patriotism is one family, patriotism does not distinguish between early and late, striving for the early liberation of Taiwan, so that the sunshine can shine on our treasure island as soon as possible, Taiwanese intellectuals also have a responsibility.

    台湾知识分子的漫漫长夜	　古凡
    夏寒和冬心
    忍过春寒又夏寒，
    冰肠毕竟暖来难。
    居住在台湾的一个诗人，写了一首题为“夏寒”的诗，这是开头的两句。泛滥在台湾“文坛”上的，是那些麻醉和毒害人心的描绘奸淫邪盗的货色，和一些千篇一律的“反共八股”。但也有一部分篇章，反映了台湾知识分子在漫漫长夜中，他们底哀伤，寒栗，忧怨，绝望的情怀；“夏寒”就是这类作品之一。台北市的一家半月刊发表了一篇题为“冬心草”的散文，作者的冬心刚好成为台湾知识分子夏寒心境的注释。文章说，在台湾，是看不见冬天的。平原地区从来不下雪，也不结冰；没有火炉；也不用穿皮袄。尽管已经过了冬至，而园林草木，还永远是绿油油的。如果说，冬的面目，应该是萧条，肃杀，枯寒，死寂；那么台湾就是个没有冬天的地方。但是，自然现象虽然如此，而台湾人心的感觉则并不这样，他们的心可能永远是冬天的，他们患了无可救药的伤感病，深陷于“春非我春”的执着，被悲哀所埋葬了。
    像这类充满了哀伤情调的笔墨，在台湾的文艺作品中是随处可见的。一个台湾作者形容台湾的知识分子是“夜行者”，他们“在茫茫长夜中，有无边的寂寞。”
    在文化荒漠中
    在台湾，无书可读，是使在那里的知识分子感到无边的寂寞的原因之一。一个曾经留学法国的台湾人士说，这几年来，台湾文化界可以说是饥荒到了极点，今天台湾所列的禁书真是恒河沙数，无从算起。
    台湾国民党当局，这几年来开列了许多张禁书清单，并且经常派出小组前往各书店、机关、学校、图书馆查封、焚毁禁书。
    这些禁书甚至包括了商务印书馆、中华书局等在解放前出版的刘仙洲译的“蒸气表与莫理尔图”，张江树著的“理论化学实验”，任鸿隽等译的“科学与科学思想发展史”，吕思勉著的“中国通史”以及“普通物理学”、“肥料学”、“织纹组合学”、“稻作学”、“稻作虫害学”、“实用制革学”、“无机化学通论”、“实用化学”、“自然地理”、“英文法”和莎士比亚剧作译本，西欧各国文学名著译本，直到辞源、辞海……
    台湾国民党当局几年来开列了许多张禁书单。仅仅其中的一张，就开列了梁漱溟、沈从文、朱光潜、严济慈、黎锦熙、舒新城等一千多位学术、文艺界人士的姓名，规定凡是这些居住在大陆的人们的出版物，不管是他著的，编的或翻译的，都一律加以查禁。辞海、辞源在台湾受到查禁，就是因为这两部辞书的大部分编辑人留在大陆。
    台湾知识分子像生活在文化的沙漠中，书店和图书馆成了真空状态。
    台湾文艺工作者既无书可读，要创作更难。在国民党既反动又愚昧的政策下，从作家到演员，他们的作品与演出，除了必须小心翼翼，回避许多“忌讳”以外，还要有固定的“反共八股”的主题，硬化的格局，直到使用千篇一律的词汇，否则便不能过国民党审查老爷的关。因此，台湾许多洁身自爱的学术工作者和文艺工作者，这几年来都搁笔不写。台湾的书报摊上，除了充斥着美国的画报、小人书等以外，就是一批实际上是流氓、烂仔的所谓“文化人”的荒唐恶劣的货色。
    失业和贫困
    台湾知识分子的大多数，物质方面也是生活在饥馑的边缘。
    一个大学的老教授的月薪不到台币一千元（一千元台币合二十五美元）。这个待遇标准是三年半以前订定的。三年半来，台湾物价上涨了三倍多，教授们的薪金却没有变。
    台湾各大学和学院的教授们，许多人在下课之后，要帮助太太买菜、做饭、抱小孩、洗尿布……，因为要雇工或请保姆，每月得花工资和伙食费台币三、四百元，约占去老教授每月薪水的三分之一。
    至于一个有十年八年教学经验的中学教师，每月只有工资台币五百元左右。许多教员为了养家活口，下课之后在外另替学生补习，星期日也不休息，以便多找点钱来免使儿女终日饥啼。不少教员因操劳过度，加以营养不良，心情忧郁，都染上了肺病或其他慢性疾病。
    然而，这些能找到职业的知识分子，比起失业的人群来，还算是侥幸的了。台湾汹涌着失业的浪潮。在一百多万失业人口中，有不少是知识分子。去年9月，台湾当局举行了“就业考试”，二千八百多名新毕业的大学生参加这次考试，只取录了九百多名，其余一千九百多人刚离开大学就走进失业的队伍中。而所谓“取录就业”，不管学的是电机工程也好，畜牧兽医也好，大多数都只是被送到台湾各机关中当一名“临时雇员”。失业的工程技术人员在台湾蹬三轮，做小贩，已经不是什么新闻。
    精神上的重压
    文化生活的饥渴和物质生活的困苦，只不过是使台湾知识分子感到窒闷的两个方面。在精神上给他们重大压力的，还有台湾的特务恐怖和在国民党黑暗统治下形成的台湾可怕的社会气氛。
    在火烧岛集中营，在台湾各监狱里，数以万计的知识分子被加上 “触犯叛逆刑事罪”、“思想嫌疑犯”等罪名，在精神上、肉体上受着惨无人道的摧残。国民党的特务已经猖獗到这样的程度，他们常常出入台湾各报纸杂志的编辑部，质问记者和编辑：“谁叫你这样写？谁叫你发那条新闻？”至于特务分子和国民党分子的密告、诬陷，在台湾更已经成为家常便饭。
    一家台湾杂志上刊载了一篇题为“杀气”的杂文，描述了台湾的特务恐怖和一种可怕的社会气氛。其中说：
   “当今台湾社会，形形色色，在芸芸众生之间，似乎弥漫着杀气腾腾的局面。人与人之间，钩心斗角，互展手段。你守我攻，你打我击。牢骚怨愤，到处可听；谣言耳语，到处可见。可以说每一个人均为这股逆流困扰，不是在应付调查，就是在防范告密。你每天提心吊胆的做人，但纠纷还是接二连三的追踪。何以今日社会上会造成这种杀气？一言以蔽之，实在是精神上没有出路，海岛侷居造成人们心地的偏狭……”
    如果不把台湾的特务恐怖和这种可怕的社会气氛，所给予人们精神上的重压估计在内，那么，对于九百万人口的台湾，为什么现在会有十多万名神经失常的人这种触目惊心的现象？是难以求得较为全面的答案的。
    他们遥念着大陆
    尽管美国和国民党当局对中国大陆的情况极尽造谣诬蔑的能事，使台湾知识分子对新中国存在着疑虑。但是，中国在共产党的领导下，已经摆脱了百年来帝国主义侵凌的局面，转弱为强，这一点他们都清楚知道。西方记者不止一次地报道，在台湾可以强烈地感觉到，台湾的中国人的内心都以他们已经有了强大的祖国而感到骄傲。不管是在台湾土生土长的知识分子也好，是解放前从大陆前去台湾的知识分子也好，只要是有爱国心的，他们在漫漫长夜的生活中，心里射进了一道光芒，他们遥念着他们虽未能完全了解真相，但已经知道确实是强大了的祖国。许多人冒险收听北京的广播。
    今年春天，台湾有人填了一首“好事近”：
   “底事苦矜持，隔面云山重叠，惟见万千言语，在盈盈双睫。当筵歌罢泪偷弹，幽怨上眉颊，未有御桥流水，怎题诗红叶。”
    这首看来是吟咏儿女情的词发表以后，在台湾一部分知识界中传诵一时。香港报纸说，这实在是台湾知识分子希望和平解放台湾的心情的反映，因为这首词发表时，正好是我国政府争取和平解放台湾的政策，在台湾流传开去的时候。“当筵歌罢泪偷弹，幽怨上眉颊。”正好是台湾当局依赖美国侵略者维持残局，备受凌辱，俯仰由人，仰承色笑的写照。
    更未残，漏未尽，台湾同胞还没有度过茫茫暗夜凄风苦雨的岁月。爱国一家，爱国不分先后，争取台湾早日解放，让阳光早日普照我国的宝岛，台湾知识分子也有责任。
