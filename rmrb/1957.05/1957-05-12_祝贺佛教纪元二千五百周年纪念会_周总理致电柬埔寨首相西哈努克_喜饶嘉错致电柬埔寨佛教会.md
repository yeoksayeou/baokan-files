Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a cable to Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk, congratulating the celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddhist Era currently being held in Phnom Penh. The cable reads:
    Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Esteemed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia:
    As your country holds the celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddhist Era, I would like to take this opportunity to wish the conference a success through Your Royal Highness. I wish the Cambodian people happiness and well-being, and I wish the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people will be increasingly consolidated and developed.
          Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, May 9, 1957

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Xi Rao Jia Cuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, sent a telegram to the Cambodian Buddhist Association on the 9th, expressing his respect to the Buddhists of Cambodia.

The telegram said: "On the occasion of the grand ceremony commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of the Buddha's Nirvana being held in your country, I would like to extend my sincere respect to the elders, bhikkhus, and all Buddhists in your country on behalf of all Chinese Buddhists.

Chinese and Cambodian Buddhists have a long history of friendship. As early as more than 1,400 years ago, eminent monks from China and Cambodia began to travel back and forth. Their contributions to promoting the Holy Teachings, exchanging culture, and enhancing the friendship between Chinese and Cambodian Buddhists are unforgettable. May the Buddhists of China and Cambodia, who have a long tradition of friendship, always be friendly and support each other in the cause of promoting the Holy Teachings and benefiting sentient beings.

I wish the Buddha's light to shine universally, the King's treasure to remain permanent, the Buddhism of your country to flourish, the nation to prosper, and the people to live in peace and happiness."
