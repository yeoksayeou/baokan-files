    McCarthy Dies
    Washington dispatch: The notorious fascist, U.S. Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy, died of acute liver disease on May 2nd.
    McCarthy was born in Wisconsin in 1909. He was appreciated and supported by the big bosses of Wall Street for his anti-Soviet, anti-communist political persecution mania. He leapt from a grocery store clerk and naval intelligence officer to being elected as a senator in 1946. In early 1953, after Eisenhower came to power, McCarthy was promoted to chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, engaging in rampant fascist persecution activities.
    His heinous crimes aroused the hatred of the American people and the condemnation of public opinion in various countries. In January 1954, six thousand citizens of New York held a rally in absentia to publicly try McCarthy, finding him guilty of "insulting and intimidating American citizens and depriving them of their legitimate constitutional rights." In April 1954, the people of Wisconsin also launched a mass movement to recall McCarthy. In order to ease domestic and international public opinion and pursue a policy of "McCarthyism without McCarthy," the U.S. Senate passed an impeachment motion against McCarthy by a majority vote in December 1954. McCarthy has since "fallen out of favor," but "McCarthyism" is still prevalent throughout the country, and the democratic and free rights of the American people are being increasingly violated and deprived.

    麦卡锡一命呜呼
    本报讯  华盛顿消息：臭名远扬的法西斯主义者、美国共和党参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡患急性肝病，于5月2日死了。
    麦卡锡于1909年生在威斯康星州。他以反苏、反共和政治迫害狂而得到华尔街大老板的赏识和扶植，从杂货店小伙计、海军情报员，一跃而于1946年当选为参议员。1953年初，艾森豪威尔上台后，麦卡锡更升任为参议院常设调查小组委员会主席，从事气焰万丈的法西斯迫害活动。
    他的滔天罪行激起了美国人民的痛恨和各国舆论的指责。1954年1月，纽约六千市民曾经举行缺席公审麦卡锡的大会，判定麦卡锡犯有“侮辱和恐吓美国公民、剥夺他们合法的宪法权利”罪。1954年4月间，威斯康星州人民也发动了罢免麦卡锡的群众性运动。为了缓和国内外舆论，奉行“没有麦卡锡的麦卡锡主义”政策，美国参议院于1954年12月以多数票通过了对麦卡锡的弹劾案。麦卡锡从此“失势”了，但“麦卡锡主义”依然盛行全国，美国人民的民主自由权利正遭到越来越严重的侵犯和剥夺。（附图片）
