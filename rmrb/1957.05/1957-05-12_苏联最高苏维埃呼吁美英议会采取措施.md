TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Supreme Soviet, in its appeal to the US and UK parliaments passed on May 10th, requested that they facilitate an agreement between the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the immediate cessation of experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and to take measures they deem necessary to achieve this goal.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet proposed to the US and UK parliaments that they consider establishing a US, UK, and Soviet parliamentary committee to study possible ways to stop testing and ban atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The appeal stated that people of all strata in all countries insist on ending the nuclear arms race and preventing catastrophes that threaten humanity. People fairly place special hope on those responsible in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, the countries that possess atomic and hydrogen bombs. Now, when the atomic age has just begun, and only three countries produce nuclear weapons, it is relatively easier to reach an agreement on measures to prevent atomic war. People all over the world expect the United Nations to play a role in resolving the issue of disarmament.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet believes that the three parliaments should fully understand their responsibility for world peace and destiny, and in preventing dangers that threaten humanity.

    The appeal also mentioned that the Soviet Supreme Soviet, in its appeal in July of last year, had already drawn the attention of the parliaments of all countries to the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Soviet government also stated that, regardless of whether a general agreement on atomic and hydrogen weapons could be reached, the Soviet Union was willing to reach an agreement on the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. The Soviet Supreme Soviet fully agrees with this step taken by the Soviet government.

    Sofia Holds Mass Meeting

    A large-scale mass meeting was held in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on May 10th to support the struggle for the prohibition of thermonuclear weapons. The gathering was organized by the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and women's, trade union, and youth organizations.

    Traykov, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Fatherland Front, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the peace-loving Bulgarian people warmly support the World Peace Council's appeal for the cessation of thermonuclear weapons testing, as well as the Soviet Union's recent proposals on disarmament, cessation of testing, and the complete prohibition of thermonuclear weapons.

    The meeting unanimously passed a telegram to the World Peace Council and the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in London, firmly demanding the immediate cessation of testing and the prohibition of thermonuclear weapons. Indian Farmers Condemn Nuclear Weapons Testing

    The Central Council of the All-India Farmers Association strongly condemned the testing of atomic nuclear weapons and called on Indian farmers to actively participate in the national movement against nuclear weapons testing.

    The Council meeting ended on the evening of May 10th, chaired by A.K. Gopalan, Chairman of the All-India Farmers Association.

    The Council's resolution stated that the Western countries are holding these tests in an attempt to destroy socialist countries and stifle the national uprisings of colonial peoples. The Council also passed three resolutions on land redistribution, food shortages, and protests against increased new taxes.

    American Magazine Writes Article

    Against Atomic Warmongering

    New York dispatch: According to a report in "The Reporter" magazine on May 9th, in Nevada and Utah, where the US government conducts nuclear weapons tests, thousands of people are at risk of being harmed by radioactive particles because the US Atomic Energy Commission lacks sufficient information to provide the public with adequate safeguards or accurately predict the results of the tests.

    An article in the magazine stated that in a town in Utah, approximately five thousand residents were exposed to air contamination within twenty-four hours that was one thousand two hundred and sixty times greater than the safe concentration prescribed by the US National Bureau of Standards for radiation workers. Since the establishment of the Nevada Test Site in 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission has consistently refused to disclose information regarding the radiation exposure of residents of Nevada and Utah.

    The magazine also pointed out in an editorial that engaging in a nuclear arms race "inevitably reaches the point where it cannot be controlled" and that this "insane thing" must end.

    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁美英议会采取措施
    据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃会议，10日通过的致美英两国议会的呼吁书，请它们促成苏、美、英三国政府就立即停止原子弹和氢弹试验性爆炸问题达成协议，并且采取它们认为实现这一目的所必需的措施。
    苏联最高苏维埃提请美、英议会讨论成立美、英、苏议会委员会，来研究导致停止试验和禁止原子武器与氢武器的可能方法问题。
    呼吁书说，一切国家的各阶层人民都坚持要求结束核武器竞赛，防止威胁人类的灾难。人民公允地对拥有原子弹和氢弹的国家美国、英国和苏联的负责人士寄予特别的希望。现在，当原子时代刚开始，还只有三个国家生产核武器的时候，就防止原子战争的措施达成协议是比较容易的。全世界人民期望联合国将在解决裁军问题上起作用。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，三国议会应当充分地了解到它们对世界和平和命运，以及在防止威胁人类的危险方面所负有的责任。
    呼吁书还谈到，苏联最高苏维埃在去年7月间的呼吁书中已经提请各国议会注意裁军和禁止原子武器与核武器问题，同时苏联政府也曾声明，不管能否达成关于原子武器和氢武器问题的总协议，苏联愿意就立即停止试验原子弹和氢弹达成协议。苏联最高苏维埃完全赞同苏联政府的这一步骤。
    索非亚开群众大会
    保加利亚首都索非亚10日举行了一个规模巨大的群众大会，支持争取禁止热核武器的斗争。这个集会是由保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会、保卫和平全国委员会，以及妇女、工会和青年团体组织的。
    祖国阵线全国委员会副主席特莱科夫在大会上致开幕词，他强调指出，爱好和平的保加利亚人民热烈支持世界和平理事会关于停止试验热核武器的呼吁书，以及苏联最近提出的关于裁军、停止试验和完全禁止热核武器的建议。
    大会一致通过了致世界和平理事会和伦敦联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的电报，坚决要求立即停止试验和禁止热核武器。印度农民谴责试验核武器
    全印农民协会中央理事会强烈谴责原子核武器的试验，号召印度农民积极参加全国反对核武器试验的运动。
    理事会会议已经在5月10日晚上结束，会议由全印农民协会主席阿·克·高普兰担任主席。
    理事会的决议说，西方国家举行这些试验，实际上是想毁灭社会主义国家，扼杀殖民地人民的民族起义。理事会还通过了关于重新分配土地、粮荒和抗议增加新税的三个决议。
    美国一杂志撰文
    反对原子黩武
    纽约消息：据“记者”杂志9日报道，在美国政府进行核武器试验的内华达州和犹他州，数以千计的人民受到有放射作用的微粒伤害的危险，因为美国原子能委员会缺少足够的情报来对公众提供适当的保障或精确地预料试验的结果。
    这家杂志在一篇文章中说，在犹他州的一个市镇上大约有五千名居民在二十四小时内所受到的空气沾污的程度比美国全国度量衡局对放射线工作者所规定的保险的浓度要多一千二百六十倍。自从在1951年建立内华达州试验场以来，原子能委员会就一直不透露关于内华达州和犹他州的居民所受到的放射作用感染的情报。
    这家杂志还在社论里指出，进行核武器竞赛“不可避免地要达到不能控制的地步”，必须结束这件“疯狂的事情”。
