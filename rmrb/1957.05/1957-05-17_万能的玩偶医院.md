    The Amazing Doll Hospital
    In Sydney, Australia, there's an unusual hospital that specializes in treating dolls with broken heads and arms. Whether they are antique dolls from one or two hundred years ago or new-style dolls that can talk and walk, this hospital can bring them back to life.

    This hospital is fifty years old, and the host is Chapman. According to him, his hospital has 12,000 doll limbs of all kinds.

    The "patients" sent to this hospital for treatment include those missing heads, those missing arms and legs, those with broken eyes, those who are now paralyzed and cannot move, and those whose hair has fallen out and are bald. But no matter what kind of difficult and complicated disease it is, this store can make young customers happily take their recovered dolls home.

    万能的玩偶医院
    澳大利亚的悉尼有一家不平常的医院，在这里专门救治那些断头断手的玩偶，不论是古老至一二百年或是新式的会叫会走路的玩偶，这家医院都可以使它们起死回生。
    这家医院已经有五十年的历史，主持人是查普曼。据他说，他的医院有各种玩偶的肢体一万二千件。
    送进这家医院治疗的“病人”，有不见了头的，有不见了手和脚的，有的坏了眼睛，有的现在已经瘫痪不能动弹的，有的头发脱掉秃了头的，但是不论是那一种疑难杂症，这家商店都能使小顾客们抱着他们已经复元的玩偶欢天喜地地回家。
