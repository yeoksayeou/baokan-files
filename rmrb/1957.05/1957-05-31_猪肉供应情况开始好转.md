    Pork Supply Situation Begins to Improve
    Recently, hog production has developed rapidly in most regions, and the state's procurement volume has increased rapidly, and the pork supply situation has begun to improve.

    According to preliminary statistics, Hunan Province, one of China's main hog-producing areas, currently has 5.7 million hogs in stock, excluding those slaughtered and transferred out, an increase of 10% over the end of last year. Zhejiang Province has 3.77 million hogs, which is more than 50,000 more than in 1954, the year with the most hogs in the province. Many large and medium-sized cities are currently actively establishing hog production and supply bases. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Committee have decided to establish hog production and supply bases for Wuhan City in the counties of Huanggang, Echeng, Xiaogan, Huangpi, Wuchang, and Hanyang around Wuhan City, as well as the suburbs of Wuhan City.

    With the increase in hog production, the state's procurement volume has also increased. The national average daily procurement volume in May last year was 66,000 heads, which has increased to 83,000 heads this year. The procurement situation in several important hog-producing provinces has increased significantly compared with last year. Hunan Province increased by 60% in May this year compared with the same period last year; Shandong Province increased by 133%.

    The tense pork supply situation has begun to ease in most areas. Beijing currently supplies 1,400 heads per day and 3,600 heads on Sundays; Tianjin supplies 650 heads on weekdays and 2,000 heads on Sundays; Shanghai supplies an average of 3,500 heads per day. Medium-sized cities and county towns have also successively increased their supply volumes. Zhengzhou and Baoding, which were relatively tight in the previous period, only supplied dozens of hogs per day, but now they have increased to 150 to 200 heads respectively. Chongqing has abolished the method of limited supply and changed to a method of freely purchasing pork with grain purchase certificates. Hangzhou supplied 285 heads per day in March, which increased to 439 heads in April, and citizens can buy pork in the morning and afternoon. Most of the county towns in Zhejiang Province also have sufficient pork supplies.

    Due to the improvement of procurement and the increase in inventory, many counties and districts in Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang provinces are requesting the transfer of live pigs to other areas. The pork supply for this year's Dragon Boat Festival will increase compared with previous years. However, the development of hog production is still unbalanced, and some areas, such as Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shanxi provinces, have developed relatively slowly, so the market supply is still relatively tight. Liaoning Province still needs to import 20,000 to 30,000 heads per month from other provinces for supply, and the phenomenon of not being able to buy meat is still common in many cities.

### 猪肉供应情况开始好转

    猪肉供应情况开始好转
    最近大多数地区生猪生产发展得很快，国家收购数量迅速增加，猪肉供应状况已开始好转。
    据初步统计，目前我国主要生猪产区之一湖南省除了屠宰和外调的以外，还有存栏猪五百七十万头，比去年年终增长了10％。浙江省养猪已达三百七十七万头，比这个省养猪最多的1954年还多五万多头。不少大、中城市目前都正在积极地建立生猪的生产、供应基地。中共湖北省委和人民委员会已作出决定，在武汉市周围的黄冈、鄂城、孝感、黄陂、武昌、汉阳各县和武汉市郊区建立起武汉市的生猪生产、供应基地。
    随着生猪产量增加，国家的收购量也增加了。去年5月份平均全国每天收购六万六千头，今年增加为八万三千头。几个重要产猪省的收购情况比去年增加幅度都很大，湖南省今年5月比去年同期增加60％；山东省增加133％。
    猪肉供应紧张的局面已开始在大部地区缓和下来。北京市目前每天供应一千四百头，星期天供应三千六百头；天津市平时供应六百五十头，星期日供应二千头；上海市平均每天供应三千五百头。中等城市和县城也都先后增加了供应量。前一时期比较紧张的郑州和保定市，每天只供应几十头猪，现在分别增加到一百五十头到二百头。重庆市已经取消限量供应方法，改为凭购粮证自由购买猪肉的办法。杭州市3月份每天供应二百八十五头，4月份增加为四百三十九头，市民在上午、下午都可以买到猪肉。浙江省绝大部分的县城猪肉也都是充足供应的。
    由于收购情况好转，库存增多，山东、四川和浙江等省的很多县区，都要求生猪外运。今年端午节的猪肉供应将比往年增加。但是生猪的发展仍然是不平衡的，有些地区如辽宁、黑龙江、山西等省发展比较慢，因此市场供应还比较紧张。辽宁省现在每月还要由别的省调进两三万头来供应，买不到肉的现象在很多城市仍旧普遍存在。
