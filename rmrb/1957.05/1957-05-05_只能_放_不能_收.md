Shanghai "Liberation Daily" Editorial, April 21st

In the recent discussion of Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was discussed very enthusiastically. One debate arose: "Let go," or "pull back"? After discussion, many of our comrades have raised their understanding, realizing that the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy proposed by the Party Central Committee is entirely appropriate, a method for prospering art, a method for developing science, a policy for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and they support letting go and do not support pulling back. However, some comrades still have not eliminated their concerns, fearing to let go, and daring not to let go. Some comrades even fear that after letting go, poisonous weeds will cover the ground, overshadowing fragrant flowers, causing chaos in the world, making it impossible to clean up. This opinion exists both inside and outside the Party; however, it is more prevalent within the Party. This is very worthy of attention.

When judging a problem, people often rely on their own experience or the experiences of others they trust. Sugar is sweet; this does not cause controversy. "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," letting go or pulling back, whether it is sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty, or a combination of all flavors, is difficult to say for those who have not tasted it themselves. However, Shanghai is not without any experience in this regard. We understand some of the flavors in between. Looking back, it should be helpful for us to explore this issue, to decide whether to let go or pull back, and to understand the correct handling of contradictions among the people.

Let's start with "Let a hundred flowers bloom." Because the situation in this area, whether in the opera world or among the people of all walks of life, is relatively familiar. We have all seen the eight characters written by Comrade Mao Zedong in various theaters: "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." We have also seen many plays and had various different discussions. From here, we can more easily find common experiences.

We still remember some of the situations from a few years ago. At that time, the people's revolutionary war had just been won, bringing hundreds of millions of people into a new world. The people wanted to live a new life, not only turning over politically but also changing their cultural life. Watching new plays and plays depicting new life, performing waist drums and Yangko dances, were also manifestations of this revolutionary atmosphere. Leaving aside those who held nihilistic attitudes towards national opera, we will only say that the general audience at that time did have a fondness for new things, which was naturally a good thing, not a bad thing. The revolution had triumphed, our dramatic art was to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and people demanded that it be able to inspire people to move forward, give people a beautiful feeling, and provide pleasant rest. This was naturally appropriate. However, at that time, people had not had time to clearly distinguish which were fragrant flowers and which were poisonous weeds, and thus some excessive situations occurred. In opera troupes and cultural organizations, some people adopted crude methods to treat opera art, blindly negating many things that should not have been negated, "reforming" things that did not need "reforming" or could not be "reformed" in a simple way. Some people even believed that a certain type of opera had no future and should be abandoned, and so on. These practices had caused some losses. The Party Central Committee naturally did not listen to this advice; the Party opposed these crude practices, and the Party decided to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," allowing various types of opera to develop forward under conditions of free creation and mutual competition. The result of implementing this policy not only eliminated many chaotic phenomena but also mobilized the enthusiasm of opera workers. With unprecedented enthusiasm, they unearthed many excellent types of opera and repertoires that had been buried for a long time, and they carried out many processing and sorting, creating some new repertoires, enriching our cultural life, and promoting the development of opera.

However, even at that time, our understanding of the Party Central Committee's policy was not profound, and our implementation was not unreserved. Some people still decided what to "support" and what not to "support" based on their own preferences; some people were eager to "weed through the old to bring forth the new," treating artistic creation with simple and crude methods; for a period of time, "one-size-fits-all" opera criticism was quite popular, forming many "well-founded but unsubstantiated" rules and regulations, affecting the enthusiasm and creativity of opera performers, and the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" was limited in its implementation.

This situation became more prominent after the second half of 1955, especially in the first half of 1956, that is, after the socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory. At this time, the masses of the people were inspired by the revolutionary upsurge, and they demanded a richer and more colorful life. They demanded to see all kinds of diverse performances on the stage, and the repertoires being performed in various theaters at that time could no longer meet the needs. Opera workers also expressed that they could not meet the needs. We remember very clearly that what people often said at that time was these three "nots": audiences had no plays to watch, troupes had no plays to perform, and actors had no food to eat. Of course, this was somewhat of an exaggeration, but it did sharply indicate that the scarcity of repertoires being performed and the difficulties in the lives of actors had reached a very serious level. This was very incompatible with the vigorous development of our country. It was very unfavorable to the development of opera art. At that time, we could hear dissatisfaction everywhere, demanding a solution to this problem.

What to do? At that time, there was also a debate similar to the present: let go, or pull back? Obviously, continuing to be bound by rules and regulations, that is, continuing to "pull back," could only hinder the development of opera art; audiences were dissatisfied, and performers were dissatisfied. There was only one way out, and that was to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," that is, to resolutely and boldly "let go" in order to turn the three "nots" into three "haves": have plays to watch, have plays to perform, and have food to eat. And gradually achieve more and more good plays, "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and the prosperity of drama.

From the time the Shanghai Municipal First Repertoire Conference decided to "open up repertoires" last year to now, although it has been less than a year, we have already seen obvious results. That is, the enthusiasm and creativity of opera performers have been greatly developed, many repertoires that had not been performed for a long time have been staged, audiences have plays to watch, and the lives of performers have improved.

True, people have worried, and some people still worry today: will the result of letting go be that we see not a hundred flowers blooming but poisonous weeds growing everywhere? To answer this question, not long ago, the Shanghai Branch of the Dramatists Association organized its members to watch plays extensively in various theaters. The consensus of the majority of people was that demons and monsters have emerged, but there are not so many poisonous weeds, only some wildflowers and weeds, and some things that are neither poisonous nor non-poisonous, which are difficult to distinguish for a while, and it will take some effort to look carefully, research, and analyze them before we can figure them out. We can also look at it from the audience's perspective. Over the past year, no serious "poisoning" phenomenon has occurred.

In this way, we let go correctly, and it brought us benefits, sweet fruits, not bitter fruits. The benefits mentioned here include the appearance of some bad plays. Because, with these bad or not-so-good plays, good plays have an opposition, people can compare, can choose, can exercise their ability to distinguish, and can urge opera workers to strive to improve their political and artistic levels, and use beautiful works of art to defeat ugly things. It also prompts art critics to get busy, to watch those plays that they never watch, and to analyze those plays that are neither poisonous nor non-poisonous. This will help us discover fragrant flowers, identify poisonous weeds, and after identifying them clearly, use analysis and criticism to remove poisonous weeds and turn them into fertilizer.

Of course, our work still has shortcomings. That is, because our understanding of the Party's policy is not deep or thorough, we have not let go enough. This is reflected in the fact that we are still a little uneasy, both letting go and fearing to let go, without a "bottom line" in our hearts. Especially when something wrong appears on the stage, some people always lose their composure and their hands itch, thinking of immediately taking action and cutting it off with a simple method. They still do not understand that to let a hundred flowers bloom is to have poisonous weeds appear. Where even grass does not grow, flowers cannot grow. The appearance of one or two poisonous weeds is not terrible. If there are too many poisonous weeds, the audience will not agree. We cannot use simple methods to deal with poisonous weeds. We should do better, turning poisonous weeds into fertilizer, into preventive medicine. We should see that the political level and artistic appreciation level of the vast audience are constantly improving, and the political consciousness of opera workers is also constantly improving. There are not so many people who knowingly watch and want to watch bad plays. To eliminate poisonous weeds, we must let them come out. It is useless to forbid them from coming out. Fragrant flowers always develop in competition with poisonous weeds, new things always grow in the struggle with decaying forces, and beautiful art always prospers in the process of defeating ugly things. The more resolutely we implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," the more we can prosper socialist art.

Here we can see a law: whenever we resolutely implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," we get benefits and taste sweetness; whenever we do not implement this policy resolutely or even violate it, we suffer. This lesson cannot be said to be profound.

Then, it is easy for us to answer this question. Let go, or pull back? Only let go, not pull back. This is the case in art, this is the case in academics, and this should be the case in handling various problems of contradictions among the people. If we review the situation in all aspects of the past year, we can definitely draw a similar situation to the development of opera art and draw the correct conclusions.

It is just because we do not have much experience in the matter of "letting go," and we have not tasted the sweetness of "letting go" in all aspects, that the enthusiasm for "letting go" is not so strong. So, let us try it and taste it. Practice will give us more courage to move forward. To learn to swim, you have to get into the water. Once you get into the water, you know that it is not so easy to drown. Once you let go, you will understand the joy of it and not want to pull back.

The proletariat is the most revolutionary class; only by liberating all mankind can it completely liberate itself. In the process of liberation, we will not lose anything, because we originally had nothing except the chains of slaves. Therefore, we are not afraid to let go, and we dare to develop the cause of communism in free competition. Today, when Marxism has already been in a guiding position in the lives of our people, and when we have achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution, we can be more bold and let go to carry out the competition. Of course, there are difficulties. As early as 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in his famous essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Some of the things we are familiar with will soon be idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." At that time, we did not deeply appreciate this point. Now, after the domestic class struggle has basically ended, we have a deeper understanding of the weight of these two sentences. We must use the same enthusiasm and perseverance that we used to learn to engage in class struggle to learn to correctly handle contradictions among the people and to learn many things we do not understand in the process of building socialism. And this, like learning to engage in class struggle, can only be gradually learned in practice and in struggle. "Pulling back" cannot train the masses, train the class, or train cadres; only by "letting go," only in the process of letting go, being modest and prudent, and working diligently, can we be trained and learn the experience of handling new problems.

### 只能“放”不能“收”

    只能“放”不能“收”
    上海“解放日报”4月21日社论
    在最近讨论毛泽东同志关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告中，对“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，讨论得很热烈。其中有一个争论：“放”，还是“收”？我们很多同志，经过讨论，认识提高了，懂得了党中央提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，是完全切合时宜的，是繁荣艺术的方法，是发展科学的方法，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，赞成放，不赞成收。但是，也还有一部分同志仍然没有消除自己的顾虑，怕放，不敢放。有的同志甚至唯恐放了以后，毒草遍地，盖过香花，天下大乱，不可收拾。这种意见，党内有，党外也有；不过，党内多一些。这是很值得注意的。
    判断一个问题，人们常常根据自己的经验，或者自己相信了的别人的经验。糖是甜的，这个引不起争论。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，放，还是收，这里面是甜、是酸、是苦、是辣、是咸，还是五味俱全，在没有亲口尝一尝的人看来，是很难说的。但是，对这个问题，我们上海也并不是一点经验也没有的。我们懂得了中间的一些味道。回味一下，对于我们探讨这个问题，对于决定放还是收，对于理解正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题，应当说是有好处的。
    我们还是从“百花齐放”说起。因为这方面的情况，不论是戏曲界，还是各界人民，都比较熟习些。我们在各个剧场里都看到过毛泽东同志写的八个字：“百花齐放，推陈出新”。我们也看过很多戏，也有过各种不同的议论。从这里，我们比较容易找到共同的经验。
    我们还记得几年前的一些情况。那时，人民革命战争刚刚胜利，它把几万万人带进了一个新天地，人民要过新生活，不但在政治上翻了身，文化生活也要换换样子。要看新戏，要看表现新生活的戏，打腰鼓，扭秧歌，也是这种革命风气的一种表现。我们且不说那些对民族戏曲抱虚无主义态度的人，我们只说当时一般观众，确实有这么一种喜欢新东西的风气，这自然是好事，不是坏事。革命胜利了，我们的戏剧艺术是为工农兵服务的，人们要求它能够鼓舞人民前进，使人民得到美好的感受和愉快的休息，这自然是应当的。但是，那时人们对于哪些是香花，哪些是毒草，也还没有来得及分辨清楚，因而也发生了一些过分的情况。在戏曲团体、文化机关里，有些人对待戏曲艺术，采取了粗暴的办法，盲目地否定了许多不应当否定的东西，“改革”了一些不需要“改革”、或者不能够用简单方式“改革”的东西，有的人甚至于认为某个剧种没有前途，某个剧种应当抛弃，等等。这些做法曾经造成了一些损失。党中央自然没有听从这种劝告，党是反对这种粗暴的做法的，党决定实行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策，让各个剧种在自由创造、互相竞赛的条件下向前发展。这个政策执行的结果，不但消除了许多混乱现象，而且把戏曲工作者的积极性调动起来了，他们以前所未有的热情，把许多长期被埋没的优秀的剧种、剧目发掘出来了，并且进行了许多加工和整理，创造出一些新的剧目，丰富了我们的文化生活，推动了戏曲事业的发展。
    但是，就是在那个时候，我们对中央的这个政策，在认识上是不深刻的，在执行上是不放手的。有的人还是凭着自己的好恶，决定“扶植”什么，不“扶植”什么；有的人急于“推陈出新”，用简单粗暴的方法对待艺术创造；有一个时期，“一棍子打死”式的戏曲批评相当流行，形成了许多“事出有因、查无实据”的清规戒律，影响了戏曲艺人的积极性和创造性，“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策在执行中受到了限制。
    这种情况，到了1955年下半年以后，特别是到了1956年上半年，也就是社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利以后，问题就显得突出了。这时，人民群众受到革命高潮的鼓舞，他们要求更加丰富多采的生活。他们要求从舞台上看到各式各样的、多种多样的表演，当时各个剧场上演的剧目，已经不能满足需要了，戏曲工作者也表示不能满足了。我们记得很清楚，那时人们经常讲的是这么三个“没有”：观众没有戏看，剧团没有戏演，演员没有饭吃。当然，这是有些夸张的说法，不过，它确实尖锐地表明当时上演剧目贫乏、演员生活困难，已经达到很严重的程度了。这是同我们国家的蓬蓬勃勃发展的情况很不适应的。对戏曲艺术的发展是十分不利的。当时，我们到处可以听到不满的意见，要求解决这个问题。
    怎么办呢？那时也有过同现在差不多的争论：是放，还是收？显然，继续受清规戒律的束缚，也就是继续“收”，是只能阻碍戏曲艺术的发展的；观众不满，艺人不满。出路只有一条，这就是坚决贯彻执行党中央“百花齐放”的方针，也就是坚决地大胆地“放”，才能够把三个“没有”变为三个“有”：有戏看，有戏演，有饭吃。并且逐步地作到好戏越来越多，“百花齐放”，戏剧繁荣。
    从去年上海市第一次剧目会议决定“开放剧目”到现在，虽然只有不到一年的时间，我们已经看到了明显的效果。这就是：戏曲艺人的积极性创造性大大发扬起来了，许多久已不演的剧目上演了，观众有戏看了，艺人的生活改善了。
    不错，人们耽心过，今天仍然有人耽心：放的结果是不是弄得不见百花齐放，只见毒草丛生了呢？为了答复这个问题，不久以前，戏剧家协会上海分会组织他们的会员，到各个剧场普遍看戏，比较多数人的意见是：牛鬼蛇神是出来了，但毒草并不那么多，只能说多了一些野草闲花，还有一些是似毒非毒的东西，一时分辨不清，还要下一番功夫，仔细看一看，研究分析一番，才能弄清楚。我们还可以从观众方面看，一年来，也并没有发生严重的“中毒”现象。
    这样看来，我们是放对了，它给我们带来的是好处，是甜果，并不是苦果。这里说的好处，是包括出现了一部分不好的戏在内的。因为，有了这一部分坏的或不好的戏，好戏才有了对立物，人们才可以比较，才可以选择，才可以锻炼自己的辨别力，才可以促使戏曲工作者努力提高自己的政治水平和艺术水平，用美好的艺术作品去战胜丑恶的东西。它也促使艺术批评家忙起来，去看那些他们从来不看的戏，去分析那些似毒非毒的戏。这样，就会帮助我们发现香花，识别毒草，并在识别清楚以后，用分析批评的方法，清除毒草，把它变成肥料。
    当然，我们的工作还是有缺点的。这就是，由于我们对党的政策领会不深刻，不透彻，我们放得还是不够。这表现在，我们总还有些不放心，又放，又怕放，心里没个“底”。特别是当舞台上出现了一些不对头的东西的时候，总是有些沉不住气，有些同志手发痒，想着立刻动手，用简单的方法，把它一刀砍掉。还不了解，要百花齐放，就会出现毒草。连草也不长的地方，花也长不起来。出现一两棵毒草，并不可怕。毒草多了，观众也不答应。对待毒草，不能用简单的方法。我们应当作得好一些，把毒草变成肥料，变成防疫药物。我们应当看到，广大观众的政治水平和艺术欣赏水平是不断提高的，戏曲工作者的政治觉悟也是不断提高的。明明知道是坏戏，还一定要演、一定要看的人，并不那么多。为了清除毒草，也只有让它出来。禁止它出来，是没有用的。香花总是在和毒草竞赛中发展起来的，新生事物总是在和腐朽的力量作斗争中生长起来的，美好的艺术总是在战胜丑恶东西的过程中繁荣起来的。我们越是坚决地执行“百花齐放”的方针，越是可以把社会主义的艺术繁荣起来。
    这里我们可以看出一个规律：凡是我们坚决执行“百花齐放”“百家争鸣”政策的时候，我们就得到好处，尝到甜头；凡是我们执行得不坚决以至违反了这个政策的时候，就吃苦头。这个教训，不能不说是深刻的了。
    那么，我们就容易答复这个问题了。是放，还是收？只能放，不能收。艺术上是这样，学术上是这样，处理人民内部矛盾的各种问题，都应当是这样。如果我们把去年一年各方面的情况回顾一下，一定可以得出同戏曲艺术的发展类似的情况，得出正确的结论。
    只是因为我们在“放”这个问题上还没有很多经验，还没有在各方面吃到“放”的甜头，“放”的劲头也就没有那么足。那么，就让我们试一试吧，尝一尝吧。实践是会给我们增加前进的勇气的。要学会游泳，就要下水，下了水，就知道并不那么容易淹死人。放了，也就懂得其中的乐趣，不想收了。
    无产阶级是最革命的阶级，只有解放全人类，他才能彻底解放自己。在解放的过程中，我们不会失去什么东西，因为我们原来就没有东西，除了奴隶的锁链以外。因此，我们就不怕放，我们就敢于在自由竞赛中发展共产主义的事业。到了今天，当马克思主义在我国人民生活中已经处于指导地位，当我们已经取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利以后，我们更可以大胆放手地去进行竞赛。当然，有困难。远在1949年，毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”这篇著名的论文中就曾指示我们：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”当时，我们对这一点还体会不深。现在，当国内的阶级斗争基本结束以后，我们就比较深刻地领会到这两句话的分量了。我们必须用学习搞阶级斗争的那种热情和毅力，去学会正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，去学会建设社会主义过程中许许多多不懂的东西。而这也如同学习搞阶级斗争一样，是靠在实践中、在战斗中才能逐步学到一些东西的。“收”是不能锻炼群众，锻炼阶级，锻炼干部的；只有“放”，只有在放的过程中，谦虚谨慎，勤勤恳恳，我们才能够受到锻炼，学到处理新问题的经验。
