Textiles Made From Wood
		Hao Jie

    When you walk into the forestry hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition, you will surely be attracted by the many dazzling silks, satins, and woolens hanging on the large cylindrical pillar. Before hearing the explanation from the guide, you might think they are made of fine silk or wool. In fact, they are all made of wood.

    How can wood be woven into textiles? We know that wood is composed of lignin and wood fiber. If the lignin is removed, wood fiber resembling silk will remain. One cubic meter of wood can produce 200 kilograms of wood fiber, which is equivalent to the cotton harvested from 7.5 mu of cotton fields in one year, or the silk spun by 320,000 silkworms, or the wool sheared from 440 sheep in one year.

    After chemical treatment, wood fiber is turned into rayon. One type of rayon is less than one-third the thickness of spider silk, while cotton fiber is seven times thicker and natural silk is five times thicker. Textiles woven from it appear to be transparent. One cubic meter of wood can produce 160 kilograms of this fine rayon, enough to weave 4,000 pairs of stockings.

    Wood can also be made into artificial wool that is finer, whiter, and softer than sheep's wool, and artificial cotton that is whiter and softer than natural cotton, through different chemical treatments. Clothes made of artificial wool and artificial cotton are both beautiful and durable.

    Although the raw materials for rayon, artificial wool, and artificial cotton are all wood, not all wood is suitable. Spruce is the best because it has a high cellulose content and long fibers. The second best is beech. China is a country with relatively scarce wood resources. To develop artificial fibers in the future, in addition to vigorously conserving wood suitable for making rayon, we must also actively expand the cultivation area of this type of wood.

    Countries around the world are now striving to develop artificial fibers. Before liberation, China had only two artificial fiber factories - Andong Chemical Fiber Factory and Shanghai Anle Rayon Factory. The Andong Chemical Fiber Factory was severely damaged by the Kuomintang before liberation and was shut down for a long time. The Shanghai Anle Rayon Factory was located near a residential area in the western suburbs of Shanghai. The waste gas produced during the manufacture of rayon, hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide, posed some harm to people's health, so it has never been put into production. Both factories are now being restored or rebuilt. The Andong Chemical Fiber Factory is expected to start production this year on "July 1st", with a maximum daily output of five tons this year. The Shanghai Anle Rayon Factory is also expected to be completed this year, with an estimated temporary daily output of 500 kilograms. In addition, the state plans to build a new artificial fiber factory in Baoding City, Hebei Province this year, which is expected to be completed in 1959 or 1960, with a daily output of 15 tons.

### 木材制成纺织品

    木材制成纺织品	郝洁
    当你走进全国农业展览会林业馆的时候，一定会被那个大圆柱子上悬挂着的许多耀眼的绸缎呢纱吸引住。在没有听到解说员讲解以前，你也许认为它们是多好的丝或毛织成的。其实，它们都是用木材做成的。
    木材怎么能织成纺织品呢？我们知道，木材是由木质素和木纤维构成的，如果把木质素去掉，就会剩下像丝一样的木纤维。一立方公尺木材可以制成二百公斤的木纤维，等于七亩半棉田一年所收获的棉花，或者是三十二万条蚕吐出来的丝，或者是四百四十头羊身上一年内剪下来的毛。
    木纤维里经过化学处理以后，就变成了人造丝。有一种人造丝，还不到蜘蛛丝的三分之一粗，棉花纤维比它粗七倍，天然丝比它粗五倍。用它织出来的纺织品，看起来像是透明的。一立方公尺的木材可以制成一百六十公斤这样细的人造丝，够织四千双长统丝袜。
    木材经过不同的化学处理，还可以制成比羊毛还细还白还柔软的人造毛，和比天然棉还白还柔软的人造棉。用人造毛人造棉做成衣服，既美观，又耐用。
    人造丝、毛、棉的原料虽然都是木材，但并不是什么木材都可以。其中以鱼鳞松最好，因为鱼鳞松纤维素含量高，纤维也长。其次是山毛撵。我国是个木材资源较缺乏的国家，今后要发展人造纤维，除了大力节约适于制人造丝的木材外，还必须积极扩大这种木材的栽培面积。
    现在世界各国都在努力发展人造纤维。我国在解放前，只有两个人造纤维厂——安东化学纤维厂和上海安乐人造丝厂。安东化学纤维厂在解放前，被国民党严重破坏，曾经长期停产；上海安乐人造丝厂设在上海市西郊住宅区附近，制造人造丝时产生的废气——硫化氢和二硫化碳，对人民健康有些危害，因此一直没有投入生产。现在这两个厂都在恢复或改建。安东化学纤维厂预计今年“七一”可以开工生产，本年最高日产量是五吨。上海安乐人造丝厂今年内也可改建完成，预计暂时日产量是五百公斤。另外，国家又计划今年在河北省保定市兴建一座人造纤维厂，预计在1959或1960年建成，日产量将达十五吨。
