Xinhua News Agency, May 5th – More than thirty geneticists in Beijing discussed how to further implement the “Hundred Schools of Thought” policy, as well as the establishment of genetic research units and genetic education.

Li Ruqi, Li Jidong, Dai Songen, and others all believed that the Morgan theory and the Michurin theory are not irreconcilable. Different views on genetic phenomena are due to different perspectives. In the future, as long as everyone exchanges opinions more and absorbs the advantages of various theories, they can be integrated. Dai Songen said: Dividing genetics into two opposing factions is an artificial divide, and we should quickly turn back from the detours we have taken.

Cai Xu and Li Ruqi both said that the opening of Morgan-school genetics at Beijing Agricultural University and Peking University was successful, allowing many people to understand the Mendel-Morgan theory. However, the Morgan and Michurin theories should now be placed on an equal footing in order to change the current phenomenon of discrimination against the Morgan theory in some places.

Many people at the meeting also stated that the most important thing in genetics at present is learning and carrying out work, because 99.9% of the material in genetics courses comes from others, and there is no need to rush to criticize.

Regarding the issue of research institutions, most people believe that the establishment of a national academic committee on genetics is necessary, but research personnel should not be concentrated, so as to facilitate teaching and cadre training in various regions.

The meeting was held on the 3rd.

    北京遗传学家举行座谈会
    主张吸收各种学说的优点
    新华社5日讯　北京三十多位遗传学家讨论了如何进一步贯彻“百家争鸣”和遗传学研究单位的设置、遗传学的教育等问题。
    李汝祺、李继侗、戴松恩等都认为，摩尔根学说和米丘林学说不是不可调和的，对遗传现象有不同的看法，是由于看问题的角度不同，以后只要大家多交换意见，吸取各种学说的优点，是可以融合在一起的。戴松恩说：把遗传学划分为两个对立的派别，是人为的鸿沟，已经走的弯路应该赶快回头。
    蔡旭和李汝祺都说北京农业大学和北京大学开设摩尔根派遗传学是成功的，使许多人对孟德尔摩尔根学说有了了解。但是现在应该把摩尔根和米丘林的学说放在平等的地位，以改变目前在某些地方歧视摩尔根学说的现象。
    会上很多人还表示：目前在遗传学方面重要的是学习，是开展工作，因为遗传学课程中99.9％是人家的材料，不要急于批判。
    关于研究机构问题，大部分人认为成立全国性的遗传学学术委员会是必要的，但是研究工作的人员不要集中，以利各地的教学和培养干部。
    这次会议是在3日召开的。
