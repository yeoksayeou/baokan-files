Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: An Egyptian delegation headed by Lutfi Banna, Undersecretary of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance, left Cairo on May 16 for Rome. The delegation is scheduled to meet with British representatives in Rome on May 23 to negotiate the unfreezing of Egyptian pound deposits in Britain and the resumption of trade between the two countries.

The British "Economist," published on the 17th, said that restoring diplomatic relations between Britain and Egypt would be a wiser approach. It stated that Britain's attempts to undermine the Nasser regime had proven to be a mistake. Britain should act based on reality. In Egypt, the reality is that the Egyptian government is President Nasser's government.

    埃及代表团往罗马
    将同英国谈存款和贸易问题
    据新华社讯　以埃及财政部次长卢特菲·巴纳为首的埃及代表团5月16日离开开罗前往罗马。代表团预定5月23日在罗马同英国代表谈判解冻埃及在英国的英镑存款问题和恢复两国贸易问题。
    17日出版的英国“经济学家”说，英国和埃及恢复外交关系是比较明智的做法。它说，英国曾经想搞垮纳赛尔政权，事实说明这种意图是错误的。英国应该根据现实来办事。在埃及，现实是埃及政府是纳赛尔总统的政府。
