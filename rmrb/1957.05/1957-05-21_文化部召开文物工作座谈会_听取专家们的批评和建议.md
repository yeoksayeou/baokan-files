    Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch This Newspaper. On the 15th and 20th of this month, the Ministry of Culture invited cultural relics experts in Beijing to discuss current issues in cultural relics work. The experts raised many criticisms and suggestions to the Ministry of Culture on this issue.

    The experts pointed out that the National Museum Work Conference held by the Ministry of Culture last year determined that the tasks of museum work were: (1) collecting cultural relics, (2) educating the masses through exhibitions, and (3) conducting scientific research. However, in actual work, the focus is on exhibitions, turning some experts into exhibition designers, busy with daily affairs, and rarely engaged in scientific research. However, if the scientific research of cultural relics is not done well, the collection and exhibition work cannot be done well either. They hope to strengthen leadership in this area.

    Some experts estimate that the work on cultural relics after liberation has involved more collection and less sorting and protection. Experts from the Palace Museum pointed out that their unit has millions of cultural relics, but there are still no planned arrangements for sorting them. Many experts have reported that there are still many chaotic phenomena in the preservation of cultural relics in various places. Some provinces are both rescuing and destroying cultural relics. At the meeting, many experts suggested that the Ministry of Culture should emphasize that cultural relics cadres should study knowledge and become knowledgeable people.

    Qi Gong, a professor of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, used the Longquan cultural relic destruction incident as an example to illustrate that the leadership is too tolerant of those who destroy cultural relics; this is not a matter of understanding, but a matter of breaking the law. Yang Zhongjian, director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, suggested that the Ministry of Culture should overcome the phenomenon of neglecting the protection of cultural relics in the field of natural sciences. He said: Protecting these cultural relics is of great significance not only for the study of Chinese history but also for the study of world history. Pan Jiezzi, a researcher at the Beijing History Museum, advocated that the work of collecting and researching world cultural relics should also be valued.

    The experts severely criticized the dogmatism in the work of cultural relics.

    Cultural relics experts Shen Congwen and Su Bingqi criticized the Ministry of Culture and the Cultural Relics Bureau for not being hands-off enough in their leadership of cultural relics work. Shen Congwen said that when he inspected several provinces and cities, he found that many history professors and students from normal colleges and comprehensive universities hoped to use unearthed cultural relics as practical teaching materials but could not get them. This is because the system stipulated by the Ministry of Culture is too rigid, making it impossible to transfer cultural relics; and no attention has been paid to combining cultural relics work with scientific research. Su Bingqi said that for many years, the Cultural Relics Bureau has relied too much on administrative means and administrative cadres to do cultural relics work, but has not seen the academic and mass nature of cultural relics work, ignored the principle of focusing on publicity work, and has not organized a wide range of social forces for excavation and sorting. He hopes that the Cultural Relics Bureau can re-examine the entire system and work system in this rectification.

### 文化部召开文物工作座谈会  听取专家们的批评和建议

    文化部召开文物工作座谈会
    听取专家们的批评和建议
    本报特约新华社专稿　本月15日和20日文化部邀请在北京的文物专家们座谈当前的文物工作问题。专家们就这个问题对文化部提出许多批评和建议。
    专家们指出：去年文化部召开的全国博物馆工作会议，确定博物馆工作的任务是：（一）收藏文物，（二）通过陈列展览向群众进行教育，（三）进行科学研究。而在实际工作中，却以陈列为主，使一些专家都变成陈列设计员，忙于日常事务，很少从事科学研究。但是文物的科学研究工作作得不好，收藏、陈列工作也不可能作好。他们希望加强这方面的领导。
    有的专家对解放后文物工作的估计是：搜集多，整理、保护少。故宫博物院的专家们指出，他们一个单位有上百万件文物，但现在还没有有计划地整理。许多专家反映各地文物保管工作还存在着不少混乱现象。有的省份一面在抢救文物，一面在毁灭文物。会上，许多专家提出，文化部应该强调文物干部要学习知识，要使自己成为有学问的人。
    北京师范大学中文系教授启功以龙泉破坏文物事件为例，说明领导上对破坏文物的人太姑息了；这不是一个认识问题，而是一个犯法问题。中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室主任杨钟健提出，文化部应该克服忽视对自然科学方面文物保护的现象。他说：保护这些文物，不仅对中国历史研究，而且对世界历史研究都有重要意义。北京历史博物馆研究员潘洁兹主张对世界文物搜集和研究的工作也应该重视。
    专家们严厉地批评了文物工作中的教条主义。
    文物专家沈从文、苏秉琦批评文化部、文物局在文物工作的领导上不够放手。沈从文说，他到几个省市视察，发现许多师范学院和综合大学的历史系教授和学生希望出土文物作实物教材而不可得，这是因为文化部规定的制度太死，使得文物不能调动；而且没有注意到把文物工作和科学研究结合起来。苏秉琦说，多年来文物局过多地依靠行政手段，依靠行政干部作文物工作，而没有看到文物工作的学术性和群众性，忽视了以宣传工作为主的方针，没有组织广大的社会力量进行发掘和整理。他希望文物局在这次整风中，能把整个的体制、工作制度重新考虑一下。
