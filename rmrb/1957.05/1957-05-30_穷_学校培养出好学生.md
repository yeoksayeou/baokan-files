    "Poor" School Cultivates Good Students
    By Our Correspondent Li Qian
    Editor's Note: Running schools with diligence and thrift not only saves the country a lot of money, but also cultivates many talents with a spirit of hard work and a strong will. The experience of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical Workers School introduced here is very valuable.
    Outside the West End Gate of Xi'an City, near many newly built factories and buildings, there is a stretch of low earthen walls. Inside the walls are rows of old adobe houses. This is the Xi'an First Aviation Technical Workers School.
    This place was originally a concentration camp where the Kuomintang massacred revolutionary patriots. At that time, there were only some dilapidated adobe houses inside. In the early days of liberation, the preparatory office of a factory was once located here, and they built more than a dozen adobe houses. This school was established in these dilapidated houses in 1951. Over the years, the state has not given the school a single yuan for basic construction.
    Now, the school has more than 820 students, and the building area of the dormitory is only over 1,600 square meters. The dormitories have earthen walls and earthen floors, but the students keep them tidy and clean. Each room of 25 square meters houses 17 or 18 students. The classrooms are not beautiful, but the air and light are very good. To the west of the classrooms is a large house with an oil-felt roof, which looks very much like a temporary shed on a construction site. This is the school's dining hall, club, and auditorium.
    Not far east from the school gate is the school's practice factory. The most orderly factory building here is a renovated old hangar left over from the Kuomintang rule. These hangars were bombed by Japanese planes, and the foundations have sunk. The best lathes in the factory are installed here. Most of the other machines are placed in very simple temporary factory buildings or sheds. A tempering furnace is installed in a wooden shed that is open on three sides and against a wall. The school's only 250-kilogram air hammer is also installed in a shed built with broken iron tiles and reed mats. Most of the machines in the practice factory are old-fashioned belt lathes bought from abroad during the Zhang Zuolin era, and have been in use for more than 30 years. The two newest lathes were made by themselves last year using old and broken machines.
    This school does not have beautiful teaching buildings and dormitory buildings, no new practice equipment, and no campus decorated with precious flowers and trees. However, in recent years, the school has trained more than 2,000 technical workers for the country. These workers are generally welcomed by the relevant factories. A factory leader said that the workers trained by this school are mostly active and responsible after joining the work, and never pick and choose when accepting tasks. Most of the students who graduated from here in 1953 and 1954 have now reached the fifth and sixth levels of technical skill, and dozens of graduates have been recommended by factories to go abroad for further study.
    The students of the school's four majors, namely, lathe, fitter, instrument, and electrical, have been able to manufacture more than 100 kinds of products with the help of their teachers, including lathes, presses, motors, bench drills, instrument testers, and universal vises. The quality of the products is relatively good, and some products have even been taken abroad for exhibition. Now, the school has established processing and ordering relationships with more than 40 units. In the past, the school's total output value was more than 350,000 yuan, and this year's planned commodity output value is 650,000 yuan. By 1959, the school plans to be self-sufficient and no longer ask the state for money.
    The Aviation Technical School has cultivated students with relatively good results and produced many kinds of machines and tools for the country under the conditions of old equipment and simple living conditions. What is the trick? There is only one, that is, the school leaders have grasped the political and ideological work tightly.
    More than 90% of the students enrolled in this school come from cities such as Shanghai and Changsha. When they were studying in junior high school, the school's equipment and living conditions were relatively good, and many people had not experienced the hardships of life. Some students told me that when they applied to the Aviation Technical School, the school had told them that there were no buildings and the equipment was not good. However, in their imagination, since it was an Aviation Technical Workers School, the equipment must be advanced; although there were no buildings, the school buildings would not be too bad. However, when they arrived at the school, they saw nothing but adobe houses and broken sheds. Looking at the old classmates in the practice factory working beside the old machines in overalls covered in oil, some people felt very uncomfortable, became emotional, and even wanted to buy tickets to go home and not study anymore. However, they also saw the meticulous care of the teachers and old classmates, felt warm in their hearts, and were embarrassed to be emotional again.
    The leaders of the Aviation Technical School did not simply use reasoning to carry out political and ideological work, but used their own practical actions to influence the students. Most of the school's three principals and other leading cadres were transferred from the army. They had undergone long-term training in the revolutionary ranks and developed a style of hard work and perseverance. After they arrived at the school, they also brought the fine tradition of leaders in the army showing close concern for soldiers. They knew that the conditions of the school were relatively poor, and the students' thinking was prone to fluctuations after they arrived at the school, so they paid special attention to ideological work when the students first arrived at the school. Every time new students are enrolled, teachers and old classmates organize a welcome committee. New students receive a warm welcome as soon as they get off the train. As soon as they enter the school gate, teachers and old classmates bring washing water and prepare hot meals. Before the new students' luggage arrives, the teachers and old classmates give their bedding to the new students to cover. At night, when the new students are asleep, the teachers have to go to the dormitory several times to see if the students are covered well. If some students kick off the quilt, they gently cover them. Therefore, the new students feel that the school is as warm as their own home. Of course, the teachers not only care for the new students, but also often care for all the students. Some students told me that just a few days ago, one night, just as the students were sleeping soundly, some people were suddenly awakened by the sound of rain. They opened their eyes and saw several people closing the windows for them in the rain, and they knew that it must be a teacher who had gotten up again. Only the next day did they know that the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch and the counselors (class teachers) had closed the windows for them.
    The leaders of this school have truly shared weal and woe with the students. Because the school has few dormitories, the students have to sleep in bunk beds, and the teachers also voluntarily changed to bunk beds. Now some teachers sleep in a room of more than ten square meters with four people, and some sleep in a room of more than twenty square meters with nine people. Principal Wang Yirui's family has ten people and only lives in two rooms. Vice Principals Ji Yi and Jiao Qiming's families both have four people and each lives in one room. At first, some students complained that there were too many people living in the dormitory, but later they saw that the teachers were also sleeping very crowded, so they had no objection.
    The school leaders often use their spare time and holidays to chat in the student dormitories and tell the students stories of the people's hard struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. Sometimes they also use holidays to go to the countryside with the students, carrying backpacks and walking dozens of miles to live for a few days, so that the students can understand the living conditions of the peasants. When teachers and students talk to each other, they also tell the students about their family life. Some teachers have a long working history, and there are elderly people and children in their families, and the average living expenses per person per month are only about ten yuan. The students compare their own lives with the peasants and with some teachers, and they feel that the school's living conditions are not bad, and they gradually develop the habit of hard work and plain living. Students who felt that life was very hard when they first came here are now satisfied with life.
    The teachers and students of the school know that our country is not rich at present, and it is impossible to spend a lot of money to build school buildings and improve equipment. The best way to overcome the difficulties in teaching and equipment is to do it yourself. As early as 1954, the members of the Communist Youth League put forward the slogan "Do something beneficial for the school." Since then, the students have been building their own campus together with the teachers. They paved the ground with cinder and built a very suitable ball field. They installed an iron bar between two trees, and they had a single bar. Subsequently, the students whitewashed the walls of the classrooms themselves and paved several paths in the yard with bricks. Some students also paved the floors of the classrooms and dormitories with broken bricks.
    In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient quantity and incomplete types of equipment in the school, some teachers in the practice factory have really racked their brains. In 1955, the practice factory had to trial-produce machines and build a tempering furnace. If the furnace was built according to the design drawings, it would require an investment of more than 6,000 yuan. However, the factory did not have so much money, so what should they do? Feng Changlin, a veteran technical worker with more than 30 years of work experience and a teacher at the practice factory, visited the tempering furnaces of several factories, and with the help of technicians, he built a tempering furnace with a small amount of refractory bricks and a large number of blue bricks, which cost only more than 200 yuan. This furnace has been in use for more than a year and is still very useful. The practice factory does not have tap water, which makes production difficult. If tap water were to be installed, it would cost at least 10,000 yuan. The teachers in charge of the practice knew that the school did not have this money, so they tried to install a large water bucket on the roof of the factory building, and then use an old water pump to pump up well water, and the water problem of the practice factory was solved. Last year, the school began to trial-produce a new type of lathe, but the practice factory only had a 14-inch shaper, which could not process the car face of the new lathe. The teachers added a tool holder to an old hexagonal lathe and converted it into a milling machine, overcoming this difficulty.
    The result of this school's diligence and thrift in running the school not only saved the country money, but also trained the students' spirit of hard work and perseverance. Several Shanghai students told me such a thing: they were very unaccustomed to life when they first came to Xi'an in 1955. A female student named Wang Xiujuan's father was an engineer and her mother was a middle school teacher. At home, even her handkerchiefs were washed by the nanny. After coming to this school, she had to wash her own clothes and dishes, and also sweep the campus and classrooms, and felt that life was very hard. She was also unaccustomed to many people living in one room, and she was unhappy when classmates sat on her bed, so she did not get along well with her classmates. However, after more than a year of training, participating in voluntary labor such as carrying soil and moving bricks together with her classmates, she became accustomed to living and her political consciousness also improved. Now she is a member of the Communist Youth League. Another student named Sheng Xinqin said that she had never washed a bowl at home. Her mother did not agree to her coming to Xi'an from Shanghai, because her health was not very good at home and her mother was worried. However, after living in the school for more than a year, her weight increased from more than 70 pounds to more than 100 pounds, and she was full of red light and no longer suffered from illness. Such students are not individual cases. They felt unaccustomed when they first came to the school, but later they gradually became more and more satisfied with the school's life. After graduation, many students often write letters to the school, and they must come to the school to see it when they pass by Xi'an. They have a deep affection for the school and are grateful to the school for cultivating them into workers who have mastered technology and have a strong will.

    “穷”学校培养出好学生
    本报记者　李茜
    编者按：勤俭办学校，不仅能给国家节省出很多资金，而且才能给国家培养出很多具有艰苦精神和坚强意志的人才。这里介绍的西安第一航空技术工人学校的经验是十分宝贵的。
    西安市的西梢门外，很多新建的厂房和楼房附近，有一带低矮的土围墙，墙里边是一排排的旧土坯房，这里就是西安第一航空技术工人学校。
    这个地方原来是国民党屠杀革命志士的集中营，当时里面只有一些破旧的土房，解放初期有个工厂的筹建处曾经设在这里，他们又建起了十几幢土坯房。1951年就在这些破旧的房子里办起了这个学校。几年来，国家没有给过这个学校一元钱的基本建设费用。
    现在，这个学校已经有八百二十多个学生，宿舍的建筑面积只有一千六百多平方公尺。宿舍里是土墙土地，学生们收拾得很整齐干净。每间二十五平方公尺的房子住十七、八个学生。教室不漂亮，空气和光线却很好。教室西边有一幢油毛毡顶的大房子，很像建筑工地上的临时工棚，这是学校的饭厅、俱乐部兼大礼堂。
    出校门向东走不远，就是这个学校的实习工厂。这里最整齐的厂房是利用国民党统治时期留下的旧机棚改建的，这些机棚曾遭受过日本飞机的轰炸，地基已经下沉，工厂里最好的车床都安装在这里面。另外一些机器大都放在非常简陋的临时厂房或棚子里。在三面露天，一面靠墙的一个木棚子里，安装着一座回火炉；学校里唯一的一台二百五十公斤的空气锤，也安装在用破铁瓦和芦席搭盖的棚子里。实习工厂的机器，大部分是张作霖时代由国外买来的老式皮带车床，使用年限都已超过三十年。其中最新的两台车床，是去年他们自己利用破旧的机器制成的。
    这个学校没有漂亮的教学大楼和宿舍大楼，没有新型的实习设备，更没有用珍贵的花木装饰起来的校园。但是，几年来这个学校为国家培养了两千多名技术工人。这些工人一般都受到有关工厂的欢迎。有一个工厂的领导人说，这个学校培养的工人，在参加工作以后，绝大部分都积极负责，接受任务从不挑肥拣瘦。1953年和1954年从这里毕业出去的学生，现在的技术水平大部分达到了五级和六级，还有几十名毕业生已经被工厂保送到国外去深造。
    这个学校所设的车工、钳工、仪表、电器等四个专业的学生，在老师们的帮助下已经能够制造一百多种产品，有车床、压床、电动机、台钻、仪表试验器、万能虎钳等。产品的质量都比较好，有的产品还被拿到国外去展览。现在，这个学校已经和四十多个单位建立了加工订货关系。过去这个学校的生产总值有三十五万多元，今年计划的商品产值是六十五万元。到1959年这个学校就打算自给自足，不再向国家要钱了。
    航空技工学校在设备陈旧、生活条件简陋的情况下培养出了成绩比较好的学生，同时又为国家生产了很多种机器和工具。究竟窍门在那里呢？只有一个，就是学校领导人员抓紧了政治思想工作。
    这个学校招收的学生90％以上都来自上海、长沙等城市。他们在初中学习的时候，学校的设备和生活条件都比较好，许多人都没有经过艰苦生活的锻炼。有些同学告诉我，他们在报考了航空技工学校的时候，校方虽然也曾经告诉他们，学校里没有楼房，设备也不好。但是，在他们的想像中，既然是航空技术工人学校，设备一定是先进的；虽然没有楼房，校舍也不会太差。但是，来到学校一看，满眼都是土房子，破棚子；再看看在实习工厂里老同学们穿着满身机油的工作服在旧机器旁边工作，有些人心里就很不舒服，闹起情绪来，甚至想买上车票回家，不学了。但是，又看到老师和老同学对自己无微不至的关怀，从心里感到温暖，不好意思再闹情绪了。
    航空技工学校的领导人员不是仅仅用讲道理的办法来进行政治思想工作，而是用自己的实际行动来影响学生。这个学校的三个校长和其他领导干部大部分是从部队转业来的。他们在革命队伍中经过长期的锻炼，养成了吃苦耐劳的作风。他们到学校以后，也把部队里首长亲切关心士兵的优良传统带来了。他们知道学校的条件比较差，新生到校以后思想容易波动，所以在学生初到校时，更特别注意思想工作。每次招收新生的时候，教师和老同学都要组织一个迎新委员会。新同学一下火车，就受到热烈的欢迎；一进校门，教师和老同学就给打来洗脸水，预备好热腾腾的饭菜。新同学的行李还没有运到，教师和老同学就把自己的被褥让给新同学铺盖。晚上，新同学睡觉了，老师们还要到宿舍里去走几次，看看同学们盖好被子了没有；有的同学把被子蹬开了，就轻轻的给盖上。因此，新同学感到学校和自己家里一样温暖。当然，教师们不光是关怀新同学，而是经常关怀着所有的同学。有的同学告诉我，就在前几天的一个夜晚，正当同学们睡得香甜的时候，有人忽然被雨声惊醒了。他们睁开眼睛看见有几个人正在冒着雨给他们关窗子，就知道一定是哪个老师又起来了，第二天才知道给他们关窗子的是团总支书记和辅导员（班主任）。
    这个学校的领导人员真正做到了和学生们同甘共苦。因为学校的宿舍少，学生们必须睡双层床，教员们也主动的改为双层床。现在有的教员四个人睡在十几平方公尺的房子里，也有的九个人睡在二十多平方公尺的房子里。校长王伊瑞家里有十个人，只住两间房子。副校长季益和焦齐鸣家里都是四口人，每家住一间房子。开始有些学生嫌宿舍住的人太多，后来看到老师也睡得很挤，就没意见了。
    学校领导人员经常利用业余时间和假日，到学生宿舍去聊天，给学生讲一些抗日战争时期和解放战争时期人民艰苦奋斗的故事。有时候也利用假期和学生一起，背上背包步行几十里路到农村去住几天，让学生了解农民的生活情况。老师和同学们谈心的时候，也把自己的家庭生活情况告诉同学。有的老师工作历史已经很长了，家里有老人和小孩，每人每月平均生活费用只有十元左右。学生们拿自己的生活同农民比一比，同一些老师比一比，便感到学校的生活条件还不算坏，渐渐地也就养成了艰苦朴素的习惯。刚来的时候感到生活很苦的学生，现在也对生活满意了。
    学校的教师和学生们知道，目前我们的国家还不富裕，不可能拿出很多钱来修建校舍和改善设备，要克服教学和设备上的困难，最好的办法就是自己动手。还在1954年，青年团员们就提出了“为学校做一件有益的事”的口号。从那时候起，同学们就和老师一起建设自己的校园。他们用灰渣铺好了地面，修起一个很适用的球场；在两棵树之间安上一根铁杆，就有了单杠。随后，学生们又自己粉刷了教室的墙壁，用砖在院子里铺上几条甬道。有的学生还用破砖头把教室和宿舍的地面也铺了起来。
    为了克服学校设备数量不足和种类不全的困难，实习工厂有些老师真是费尽了心思。1955年实习工厂要试制机器，必须建设回火炉。如果按照设计图纸修建炉子，需要六千多元的投资。但是工厂没有这样多的钱，怎么办呢？有三十多年工龄的老技术工人、实习工厂的老师冯长林参观了几个工厂的回火炉，回来后，在技术员的帮助下，就用少量耐火砖和大量青砖修建了一个回火炉，只花了二百多元。这个炉子已经用了一年多，还很好用。实习工厂没有自来水，很难进行生产。如果要把自来水安起来，最少要花一万多元。领导实习的老师们知道学校没有这笔钱，就想办法在厂房顶中安一个大水桶，再用一个旧水泵把井水吸上来，实习工厂的用水问题就这样解决了。去年学校开始试制一种新车床，但是实习工厂只有一台十四吋的牛头刨床，不能加工新车床的车面，老师们把一台破旧的六角车床增加了一个刀盘，改成铣床，克服了这个困难。
    这个学校勤俭办学的结果，不仅给国家省了钱，而且锻炼了学生吃苦耐劳的精神和坚强的意志。有几个上海同学告诉给我这样一件事：他们在1955年刚来西安的时候，生活很不习惯。有个叫王秀娟的女同学，父亲是工程师，母亲是中学教员，在家的时候连手绢都是保姆洗；来到这个学校以后，她不但要自己洗衣服洗碗，还要打扫校园和教室，感到生活很苦。她对很多人住一间房子也不习惯，同学在她床铺上坐一下她就不高兴，因此，和同学们处得也不融洽。但是，经过一年多的锻炼，和同学一起参加抬土，搬砖头等义务劳动，生活过惯了，政治觉悟也提高了。现在她已经是一个青年团员。另外一个名叫盛新琴的学生说，她在家的时候连碗都没洗过。从上海到西安来，妈妈也不同意，因为在家时身体不太好，妈妈不放心。可是，在学校生活了一年多，体重反而由七十多斤增加到一百多斤，满面红光，不再闹病了。像这样的学生不是个别的。他们刚来学校的时候感到不习惯，后来渐渐的对学校的生活愈来愈满意。毕业以后，很多学生都经常给学校来信，路过西安的时候，一定到学校来看看。他们对学校有深厚的感情，感谢学校把自己培养成掌握技术和有坚强意志的工人。
