Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: Chairman Voroshilov and the other Soviet guests returned to Beijing by special plane this afternoon. Chairman Voroshilov left Beijing on May 6th to visit the Republic of Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　The silver plane carrying Chairman Voroshilov landed at 5:40 PM. After disembarking, he was welcomed by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers, Vice Chairmen, other national leaders, and heads of relevant departments.

　　This afternoon, Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, and the envoys of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Mongolia, and other countries also went to the airport to welcome him.

　　Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, went to the Qin Zheng Dian in Zhongnanhai to rest. When Chairman Voroshilov arrived at the Qin Zheng Dian, Chairman Mao Zedong greeted him at the entrance. After they met, Chairman Voroshilov told Chairman Mao, "President Sukarno asked me to send his greetings to you, and he wishes you all the best!" "Also," Chairman Voroshilov said to Chairman Mao, "Chairman Ho Chi Minh also asked me to send his greetings to you and other Chinese comrades, and he also wishes you all the best!" Chairman Mao smiled and said, "Thank you very much! Thank you very much!"

　　Chairman Voroshilov, on his special plane from Hanoi to Beijing today, passed through Wuhan and visited the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge for the second time. At about 12 noon, as soon as Chairman Voroshilov got off the plane, he said to Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who came to welcome him, "I heard that the bridge has been joined, and I want to see it again. It would be difficult to see it again if I miss this opportunity." Then, accompanied by the host, he drove to the Wuchang bridgehead construction site of the Yangtze River Bridge to visit. There, Chairman Voroshilov looked up at the tall building and repeatedly asked Soviet expert Karpinsky about the closure of the steel beams. Hundreds of bridge builders, hearing that Chairman Voroshilov had visited for the second time, came forward to welcome the distinguished guests. Chairman Voroshilov congratulated the workers and said, "Congratulations on the successful completion of the bridge construction project, and congratulations on your new achievements! After the completion of the bridge, I wish you success in your work in building new bridge projects!" The workers applauded warmly to pay their respects to him. After the distinguished guests had lunch at the airport restaurant, they left Wuhan at 2:00 PM.

　　Xinhua News Agency reported that Chairman Voroshilov ended his four-day visit to Vietnam on the 24th and left Hanoi for China by plane at 7:00 AM.

　　Chairman Ho Chi Minh reluctantly bid farewell to Voroshilov at Gia Lam Airport. Before Voroshilov boarded the plane, the two old men embraced each other tightly and kissed each other repeatedly.

　　In his farewell speech, Ho Chi Minh said that today Chairman Voroshilov is going back, which makes us extremely reluctant to part. Voroshilov will pass through four countries, Vietnam, China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, on his way from Hanoi to Moscow, a journey of tens of thousands of miles, but he will never leave the socialist family. Wherever he goes, he will see his brothers.

　　In his farewell speech, Voroshilov thanked the Vietnamese people, the government, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh for their warm reception. He wished the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Fatherland Front, the Labor Party, and the Vietnamese people more achievements in their struggle for freedom, happiness, and a unified motherland.

　　After Voroshilov boarded the plane, he repeatedly waved his hat to the cheering crowd to express his reluctance to leave.

　　On the evening before leaving Vietnam, Chairman Voroshilov held a grand banquet at the Soviet Embassy in Hanoi to bid farewell to people from all walks of life in Vietnam. (Attached pictures)

    带来苏加诺总统和胡志明主席对毛主席的问候
    据新华社24日讯　伏罗希洛夫主席和苏联的其他贵宾们在今天下午乘专机回到北京。伏罗希洛夫主席是在5月6日离开北京前往印度尼西亚共和国和越南民主共和国访问的。
      伏罗希洛夫主席乘坐的银色飞机在五点四十分着陆。他走下飞机以后，受到了朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理、副总理、副委员长以及国家的其他领导人员和有关部门的负责人的欢迎。
      今天下午，苏联驻华大使尤金，印度尼西亚、越南、缅甸、蒙古等国的使节都到机场欢迎。
    伏罗希洛夫主席由朱德副主席陪同到中南海勤政殿休息。当伏罗希洛夫主席到达勤政殿时，毛泽东主席在大门口迎接。他们见面后，伏罗希洛夫主席告诉毛主席说：“苏加诺总统托我问候你，他祝你一切都好！”“还有”，伏罗希洛夫主席又对毛主席说：“胡志明主席也托我问候你和中国的其他同志，他也祝你们一切都好！”毛主席笑着说：“非常感谢！非常感谢！”
    伏罗希洛夫主席今天乘专机由河内来北京途经武汉时，第二次参观了武汉长江大桥。中午十二时许，伏罗希洛夫主席一走下飞机，就向前来欢迎的中共湖北省委第一书记王任重说：“听说大桥合龙了，我要再去看看，失去这机会以后再看很困难。”接着在主人陪同下驱车前往长江大桥武昌桥头工地参观。在那里，伏罗希洛夫主席仰首望着这个高大的建筑物，还不时地向苏联专家卡尔宾斯基询问钢梁合龙的情形。成百个桥梁建筑者听说伏罗希洛夫主席二次光临，都不约而同地上前向贵宾表示欢迎。伏罗希洛夫主席向工人们祝贺，他说：“祝贺你们胜利地完成了大桥建设工程，祝贺你们的新成就！大桥完工以后，祝你们在建筑新的桥梁工程中工作顺利！”工人们热烈鼓掌向他致敬。贵宾们回到机场餐厅用过午餐以后，在下午二时离开武汉。
    据新华社讯　伏罗希洛夫主席24日结束了他在越南的四天的访问，上午七时坐飞机离开河内前往中国。
    胡志明主席以依依不舍的心情在嘉林机场送别伏罗希洛夫。在伏罗希洛夫上飞机之前，两位老人互相紧抱着，吻了又吻。
    胡志明在送别词中说，今天伏罗希洛夫主席要回去了，使我们万分依恋。伏罗希洛夫离开河内到莫斯科，前后要经过越、中、蒙、苏四个国家，航程数万里，但终不会离开社会主义大家庭，无论到哪里，都会见到自己的兄弟。
    伏罗希洛夫在告别词中感谢越南人民、政府和胡志明主席对他的热情接待。他祝越南民主共和国政府、祖国战线、劳动党和越南人民在争取自由幸福和统一祖国的斗争中取得更多成就。
    伏罗希洛夫走上飞机后，再三向欢呼的送别群众挥帽表示惜别。
