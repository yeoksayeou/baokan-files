    Treat Each Other With Sincerity
    Professor Xiao Zhang, Beijing Normal University

    The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is improving year by year. I agree that it is basically good, but there are still problems. The problem is that the relationship is not good enough, and there is still a gap. This is a two-way thing, and the reasons should of course be sought from both sides. Now I want to talk about it from the Party's side alone.

    We know that the vast majority of intellectuals are the masses, so the relationship between the Party and intellectuals is also a matter of the Party's relationship with the masses. The relationship between Party members and the masses is generally not as close as that among the masses themselves; it always seems unnatural. What is the reason for this? Of course, it can be said that it is because the masses have low awareness, do not understand the Party well enough, and even have wrong views, thus having a certain distance from Party members. This is a reason, but not the main one. The main reason lies in the Party members. What problems do Party members have in this regard? In my opinion, the main thing is that they are not sincere enough. Now I will only talk about two points:

    First, we feel that many Party members are not very daring or willing to expose their shortcomings in front of the masses. Their words and deeds are also very restrained. Naturally, this is no exception for intellectuals. They may think this is right, because they are afraid that if they don't do so, it may cause damage to the Party's prestige. It is good that they are loyal to and care for the Party, but doing so will probably not only fail to achieve their wishes, but will have the opposite result. Because this will make the masses feel that they are not approachable, are either "superior" or "affected," or other things, which will affect the masses' correct understanding of the Party. On the other hand, not exposing shortcomings will make the masses think that Party members are not sincere enough to them. This is a major problem for contacting the masses, because no matter how sincere your motives are, you will unconsciously create a distance from the masses from the very beginning. How can you talk about contact? We know that exposing shortcomings is an indispensable part of showing sincerity. Why are family members and fathers and sons less alienated than ordinary outsiders? Isn't it precisely because they can often expose each other's shortcomings? Isn't it also the case that friendships sometimes increase and even reach the point of being confidants when they expose each other's shortcomings? These people do not have an abstract concept of sincerity in their minds, but they have done the real thing of sincerity – exposing shortcomings, so the relationship is good. If Party members treat the masses like family members and fathers and sons, like intimate friends, dare to expose their shortcomings, and do not be so restrained in their words and deeds, then the masses will regard them as their own people and will also expose their own shortcomings. The relationship will naturally improve and eventually become intimate. The truth is very obvious!

    Secondly, there is the problem of Party members not understanding the characteristics of intellectuals well enough and not being able to conduct in-depth work. Making specific and in-depth understanding of intellectuals is a very arduous task. Because intellectuals in general have their characteristics, senior intellectuals have their individual characteristics, and each intellectual has its own characteristics on the basis of the common characteristics of its belonging class, so it is very complex. Take senior intellectuals as an example. In my personal and incorrect view, they are all relatively old and have received a deeper education in the old society. No matter which country they have studied in, their ideology (not to mention political thought) is basically more feudal (of course, there are a few exceptions, who are capitalist). As for those who have not studied abroad, needless to say (of course, there may also be exceptions). This is a common point, and each person has its own feudal characteristics. Even though it is feudal, it still has its advantages. For example, "saving face" is certainly not good, but can you say that there are no positive factors in it? I think there are. It contains a bit of the ideological component of "not wanting to fall behind," which is a positive factor. If the various different positive factors possessed by each senior intellectual can be discovered and well guided in the right direction, how much help would this be to socialist construction? Unfortunately, it seems that the work in this area is not being done well enough now. In my opinion, this problem still boils down to not being sincere enough. Why? Because the issue of sincerity is not just about having a simple concept; it must be concrete action that produces results. Some Party members' contact with intellectuals, although their motives are extremely sincere, their work is generalized, and they have not made in-depth understanding and specific analysis, so the effect is not great. This can only be said that they have not yet reached the point of wholeheartedness, which is not sincere enough; otherwise, what else can be said?

    The above is what I have thought of in terms of two points. Of course, there are other problems. But no matter how many problems there are, the general cause is probably that many Party members do not have enough understanding of the arduousness of building socialism and the importance of intellectuals in building socialism. This belongs to the issue of understanding, which is a problem that naturally arises in the process of historical development. I think it will be solved in the future.

    要相待以诚
    北京师范大学教授　萧璋
    党和知识分子的关系，逐年在改进中，说它基本上是好的，我很同意，不过还有问题。问题就在关系还不够好，还有隔阂。这是两方面的事情，原因当然应该从两方面找，现在我想单就党这方面来谈谈。
    我们知道，绝大多数的知识分子都是群众，所以党和知识分子的关系问题也就是党群关系问题。党员和群众的关系，一般来说，往往比不上群众自身之间那样的亲切，总是不大自然似的。这是什么道理呢？当然，可以说是由于群众觉悟低，对党认识不够，甚至有错误的看法，因而同党员有一定的距离。这是个原因，但不是主要的。主要原因是在党员方面，党员在这方面有些什么问题呢？我看主要是不够诚恳，现在只谈两点：
    第一，我们感觉好些党员不大敢或不大愿意在群众面前暴露他们的缺点，言谈举止，也很拘谨。自然，对知识分子也不例外。这种情况，他们也许认为是对的。因为他们怕不这样做，就可能给党的威信带来损失。他们对党忠实爱护是好的，但这样做恐怕不但不能如他们之愿，而且会有相反的结果。因为这会使群众感觉到他们不大平易近人，不是“高人一等”，便是“矫揉造作”或其他等等，以致影响了群众对党的正确认识。另一方面，不暴露缺点，在群众看来，就会认为是党员对待他们不够诚恳。这一点，对联系群众来说是个较大的问题，因为不管你动机如何诚恳，一出发就不知不觉地和群众发生了距离，还谈什么联系呢？我们知道，暴露缺点是表示诚恳的不可少的一环。家人父子为什么比一般外人要少些隔阂呢？不正是由于彼此能经常暴露缺点吗？交朋友不也有时在互相暴露缺点之际而交谊也就随之增进以至达到知己的地步吗？这些人的心理并不存在诚恳的抽象概念，却作了真正诚恳的事实——暴露缺点，所以关系是好的。党员对待群众，如果也像家人父子，知己朋友一样，敢于暴露缺点，言谈举止，也不要那样拘谨，那么，群众就会把他们看作是自己人，也会把自己的缺点暴露出来，关系自然会好起来，最后变成了知交。道理是很明显的啊！
    其次，是党员对知识分子的特点了解不够，工作不能深入的问题。对知识分子作具体的深入的了解，本是一个很艰巨的工作。因为一般知识分子有其特点，高级知识分子又有其个别特点，知识分子每个人又在其所属阶层共有特点的基础上又各具特点，所以非常复杂。拿高级知识分子来说吧。以我个人不正确的看法，他们的岁数都比较大，旧社会的教育都受得比较深，不管是在哪一国留学过，他们的思想意识（不是说政治思想），基本上还是封建成分多（当然也有少数例外，是资本主义的）。至于没有留过学的，更不用说了（当然也可能有例外）。这是一个共同点，而每个人又有其封建特点。尽管是封建的，但也还有其优点。比如“好面子”，固然不好，但你能说它里面没有积极因素吗？我看是有的。它多少包含有点“不甘落后”的思想成分，就是积极因素。假使能把每一个高级知识分子所具有的各种不同的积极因素都发现出来，并很好地引导入正确方向，这对社会主义建设该有多大的帮助啊。可惜现在这方面的工作似乎作得还很不够。这个问题，依我看，还是要归结到不够诚恳。为什么呢？因为诚恳这个问题，不是光有简单的概念就行了，而是要具体行动，见诸效果的。一些党员对知识分子的联系，尽管动机是极端诚恳的，但工作却是一般化，没有作深入的了解和具体的分析，因而效果不大。这也只好说是还没有做到全心全意的程度，也就是不够诚恳吧；否则，又该怎么说呢？
    以上是就我个人所想到的两点来谈的，当然还有其他问题。但是不管问题有多少，产生的总因，大概不外是许多党员对建设社会主义的艰巨性，对知识分子在建设社会主义方面的重要性，体会不够。这是属于认识问题，是历史发展过程中自然产生的问题，我想将来一定会得到解决的。
