Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 28th: According to a TASS report, the Algerian Communist Party's proclamation to the people, published in "l'Humanité," states that negotiations between Algeria and France are possible and necessary, based on the recognition of the Algerian people's right to national independence.

The proclamation states that such negotiations would mark the beginning of establishing free and equal relations between the two countries, with mutual respect for each other's legitimate interests.

The Algerian Communist Party emphasized in its proclamation that now is the last chance for the two countries to conclude a firm friendship agreement, before France's position in North Africa is seized by American imperialism.
