    据新华社柏林9日电　5月8日是苏联军队把德国东部地区从希特勒统治下解放出来的十二周年纪念日。柏林的大街小巷到处挂起了德国的黑红黄三色国旗和苏联国旗。报纸都以第一版的首要地位刊载了民主德国国家领导人皮克、狄克曼、格罗提渥、乌布利希、柯伦斯联名拍给苏联部长会议的贺电。
    上午九时，人民议院主席狄克曼，民主德国第一副总理、统一社会党第一书记乌布利希，副总理努舍克等以及柏林市各界代表和各国外交使节聚集在特莱普托夫公园向苏军烈士墓献花圈。
    柏林市区各国营企业都在解放日前夕举行了庆祝会。统一社会党大柏林市委员会第一书记基费特在“斯大林电气装备制造厂”的庆祝会上说：“德国人民的解放日——5月8日是民主德国全体居民表明他们拥护同苏联的亲密友谊、加强我们工农国家和反对波恩军国主义者进行原子战争准备的坚强意志的日子。”
    民主德国其他城市劳动人民在8日也纷纷到当地苏军烈士墓献花。来比锡的“列宁纪念馆”在解放日前夕开幕，当地劳动人民在纪念馆前的广场上举行了盛大庆祝会。
