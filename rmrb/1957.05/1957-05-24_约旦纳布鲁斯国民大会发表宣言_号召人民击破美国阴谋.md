Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 23rd: The Syrian newspaper "Barada" published the full text of a declaration issued by the Standing Committee of the National Congress in Nablus, Jordan, on May 22nd. It called on the Jordanian people to "unite as one to smash the American conspiracy (against Jordan)."

The newspaper said that the Nablus National Congress held a meeting on May 20th in "a secret place in Jordan."

The declaration stated that the conspiracy against Arab nationalism was prepared at the highest-level conference in Washington and the Anglo-American Bermuda. "American colonialism is helping the reactionary movement in Jordan, threatening to use the Sixth Fleet and give the current government ten million dollars to carry out this conspiracy and consolidate the imperialist forces in Jordan."

The declaration fiercely condemned the current Jordanian government for its "extremely brutal" attacks on the national movement and the Jordanian army.

Meanwhile, according to a report from Amman in Cairo's "Republic" newspaper on the 22nd, Jordanian authorities have decided to place the Speaker of the Lower House, Hekmat Masri, under house arrest. Jordanian police stations and airports have been notified not to allow him to leave the country. Seventeen of the forty members of the Jordanian Lower House have already been arrested.

In addition to placing many women engaged in the nationalist movement under house arrest, the Jordanian military authorities have also placed the wives of some leaders of nationalist parties under house arrest.

    约旦纳布鲁斯国民大会发表宣言
    号召人民击破美国阴谋
    新华社开罗23日电　叙利亚“巴拉达报”5月22日刊载了约旦纳布鲁斯国民大会常务委员会发表宣言的全文，它号召约旦人民“万众一心地起来击破美国（对约旦）的阴谋”。
    这家报纸说，纳布鲁斯国民大会5月20日在“约旦的一个秘密地方”举行了会议。
    宣言说，对阿拉伯民族主义的阴谋是在华盛顿和英美的百慕大最高级会议上准备好的。“美国殖民主义帮助约旦的反动运动，扬言要使用第六舰队和给予现政府一千万美元让它来执行这个阴谋和巩固帝国主义在约旦的势力。”
    宣言激烈谴责约旦现政府“极端残酷地”进攻民族运动和约旦陆军。
    同时，据开罗“共和国报”22日安曼消息说，约旦当局已经决定软禁下院议长赫克迈特·马斯里。约旦的警察局和飞机场已得到通知不让他离开这个国家。约旦下院议员全部四十个人中已有十七人被捕。
    约旦军事当局除软禁了许多从事民族主义运动的妇女外，还软禁了某些民族主义政党领袖的妻子。
