    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd: The Coordinating Committee on Export Controls (COCOM) subcommittee responsible for regulating trade with China held another high-level negotiation in Paris on May 21 to break the deadlock among Western countries on the issue of the trade embargo against China.
    Usually well-informed sources expect the representatives to listen to new proposals from the United States on reaching a compromise solution. Last week's meeting reached an impasse because the United States insisted on disagreeing with other countries' demands to reduce the items embargoed to China to the same level as those prohibited for export to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
    Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan are the most determined countries advocating for the relaxation of the trade embargo against China. According to well-informed sources, the attitude of these four countries has become tougher since last week.
    The "Manchester Guardian" said on May 20 that Britain had stated during the negotiations in Paris that if the outcome of the negotiations was not satisfactory, it would withdraw from the fifteen-nation "China Committee" and take unilateral action. The newspaper said that if Britain did so, then Japan, France, and West Germany would follow its example one after another.

    英法比日等国态度日趋强硬
    要求美国放宽对华“禁运”
    据新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：负责管制对中国的贸易的小组委员会5月21日再次在巴黎举行高级谈判，来打破西方国家在对中国贸易禁运问题上的僵局。
    通常消息灵通人士预料代表们将听取美国关于达成折衷解决的新建议。上星期的会议由于美国坚持不同意其他国家要求把对中国禁运的项目减少到像禁止向苏联和东欧出口的那些项目一样而陷入了僵局。
    英国、法国、比利时和日本是主张放宽对中国贸易禁运最坚决的国家。据消息灵通人士说，这四个国家的态度从上星期以来变得强硬了。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在5月20日说，英国曾经在巴黎举行的谈判里说，如果谈判的结果不能使它满意，它就要退出十五国的“中国委员会”而采取单独行动。这家报纸说，如果英国这样做，那么，日本、法国和西德也将先后仿效它的榜样。
