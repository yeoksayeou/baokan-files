Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 7th: The Qinghai Province Propaganda Work Conference, which concluded on the 2nd, focused on analyzing and studying the current problems of internal contradictions among the people in Qinghai Province, based on the actual situation in multi-ethnic areas.

The conference lasted for fifteen days. Gao Feng, First Secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, presided over the meeting. Participants included approximately 300 Party members and non-Party figures from Han, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups.

The meeting held that the relationship between and within ethnic groups in Qinghai Province has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the ethnic oppression of the old era transformed into a relationship of equality and unity among ethnic groups. However, as a result of the long-term oppression and enslavement by the reactionary ruling class in history, there still exists a varying degree of vigilance between and within ethnic groups in different regions. At the same time, due to different historical development conditions, the economy and culture of ethnic minorities in pastoral areas are relatively backward, and there is still a factual inequality between ethnic minorities and the Han people. To fundamentally change the above situation, it is necessary to gradually implement the socialist transformation of pastoral areas, so that animal husbandry production can be further consolidated and developed, and the poverty of the vast people in pastoral areas can be changed. The peaceful transformation of animal husbandry should be carried out according to the wishes of ethnic minority public figures and the masses of the people. When to carry out the transformation? How to carry it out? Should all be determined by the wishes of ethnic minority public figures and the masses of the people. Han cadres must never force it. However, due to the complexity of the situation in pastoral areas, ethnic contradictions and class contradictions are often intertwined and sometimes difficult to distinguish. Therefore, in handling these contradictions, it is necessary to conduct specific analysis based on specific circumstances, specific times, and specific places, and never act rashly.

The meeting pointed out that in order to solve these contradictions, the current issue in pastoral areas is to further exert the effectiveness of regional autonomy, so that ethnic minority cadres both inside and outside the Party have the power to truly be masters of their own affairs. This requires overcoming Han chauvinism, so that Han cadres understand the special role of ethnic minority cadres, thereby actively helping ethnic minority cadres grow and giving full play to their enthusiasm.

The meeting also pointed out that the same is true in literature and art. Qinghai Province is a multi-ethnic area, and attention should be paid to developing ethnic minority literature and art and exploring the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities. Deviating from ethnic characteristics means deviating from the reality of Qinghai. The main obstacle to implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is that many people treat ethnic minority literature and art with a Han chauvinist attitude, which must be opposed.

In order to overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, the meeting required all leaders to have more contact with the masses and go more often to cooperatives, factories, shops, and schools to understand production work and learning. Leaders should share weal and woe with the masses, and responsible cadres of leading organs at all levels should take some time each year to participate in production with the masses.

The meeting finally emphasized that a large-scale study movement should be launched immediately in Qinghai Province. This study movement is also a new rectification movement, using the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to clarify the main contradictions in the region, department, or unit by examining work, and to propose specific solutions to the contradictions.

In order to carry out this study well, the meeting required responsible cadres of Party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries, to personally lead, supervise, and inspect the study. All prefectures and counties should hold two-level or three-level cadre meetings recently to help all cadres study the documents well, examine and study the practical problems in current work, and ensure that study and central work are not neglected.

    青海省召开宣传工作会议
    根据多民族地区情况分析内部矛盾
    决定在全省立即开展整风运动
    新华社西宁7日电　2日结束的青海省宣传工作会议，根据多民族地区的实际情况，着重分析研究了青海省当前人民内部矛盾的问题。
    这次会议共开了十五天。中共青海省委第一书记高峰主持这次会议。参加会议的包括汉、藏、回、蒙古等民族的党员和党外人士约三百人。
    会议认为，青海省各民族之间和民族内部的关系，几年来已经发生了很大变化，旧时代的民族压迫已经变为各民族平等团结的关系。但是由于历史上反动统治阶级长期压迫和奴役的结果，目前民族之间和民族内部在不同地区仍然存在着不同程度的戒备心理。同时，由于历史发展条件的不同，牧业区少数民族经济文化比较落后，少数民族和汉族之间还存在着事实上的不平等。要从根本上改变上述情况，就必须逐步实行对牧业的社会主义改造，使畜牧业生产得到进一步的巩固和发展，改变牧业区广大人民的贫困状态。对于畜牧业的和平改造，要根据少数民族公众领袖和人民群众的意愿去进行。何时进行？如何进行？都要决定于少数民族公众领袖和人民群众的意愿，汉族干部决不能强迫进行。但是由于牧业区的情况复杂，民族矛盾和阶级矛盾常常是交错在一起的，有时不易分辨。因此在处理这些矛盾时，必须根据具体情况，具体时间，具体地点，进行具体分析，决不能草率从事。
    会议指出，为了解决这些矛盾，当前牧业区的问题是要进一步发挥区域自治效能，使党内外的少数民族干部有职有权，真正当家作主。这就必须克服大汉族主义思想，使汉族干部明了少数民族干部的特殊作用，从而积极帮助少数民族干部成长，充分发挥他们的积极性。
    会议还指出，文学艺术方面也是如此。青海省是一个多民族地区，应当注意发展少数民族文艺，发掘少数民族的文化遗产。脱离民族特点，就是脱离了青海的实际。当前贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”这一方针的主要障碍，是有许多人以大汉族主义态度对待少数民族文艺，这一点必须加以反对。
    为了克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，会议要求所有的领导人都要更多地同群众接触，更多地到合作社、工厂、商店和学校去了解生产工作和学习情况。领导人要同群众同甘共苦，各级领导机关的负责干部每年要抽出一部分时间去同群众一道参加生产。
    会议最后强调指出，在青海省要立即开展一个大规模的学习运动，这个学习运动也就是新的整风运动，以批评和自我批评的精神，通过检查工作，弄清本地区、本部门、本单位的主要矛盾，并且提出解决矛盾的具体办法。
    为了搞好这次学习，会议要求各级党委负责干部，特别是第一书记，必须亲自领导、监督和检查学习。各州、县要在最近举行两级或三级干部会议，帮助所有干部学好文件，检查研究目前工作中的实际问题，做到学习和中心工作两不误。
