Xinhua News Agency, London, May 28th. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said in the House of Commons on the 27th, while answering a question, that at the meeting of the "China Committee" held in Paris that day, which oversees the embargo against China, Britain "will make further efforts to reach an agreement on relaxing trade controls on China."

Someone asked whether the government, having stated that it would insist to the Americans that trade arrangements with China should not be more unfavorable than trade arrangements with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, now intends to adhere to this statement. Lloyd said, "We firmly believe that this distinction should not continue."

Lloyd very much hoped that the Paris meeting that day would be the last meeting on this issue, enabling the government to announce its decision.

News from Paris says that, according to French sources, the "China Committee" meeting on the 27th, like the meetings of the previous two weeks, still failed to reach a compromise agreement. The committee will hold another meeting later this week.

    巴黎“中国委员会”会议仍未谈拢
    劳埃德坚持要放宽“禁运”
    新华社伦敦28日电　英国外交大臣劳埃德27日在下院答复问题的时候说，在主持对中国禁运的“中国委员会”当天在巴黎举行的会议上，英国“将作进一步努力，以便就放宽对中国贸易管制问题达成协议”。
    有人问，政府曾经声明，它将向美国人坚持对中国的贸易安排不应该比对苏联和东欧国家的贸易安排更为不利，政府现在是否打算坚持这种声明？劳埃德说：“我们坚决认为这种区别不应该继续下去。”
    劳埃德十分希望当天的巴黎会议是关于这个问题的最后一次会议，而使政府得以宣布它的决定。
    来自巴黎的消息说，据法国人士透露，27日的“中国委员会”会议像上两周的会议一样，仍然没有达成折衷协议。委员会将在本周晚些时候再举行会议。
