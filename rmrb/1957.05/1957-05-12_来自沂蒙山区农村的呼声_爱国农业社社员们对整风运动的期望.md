Voices from the Rural Areas of Yimeng Mountain
——Expectations of Members of the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative for the Rectification Movement
By our reporters Xiao Yan and Xiang Cun

The news of the unfolding Rectification Movement greatly encouraged the cadres and members of the Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Yimeng Mountain area. These days, the members love to recount touching new events: the county Party secretary leading county cadres in physical labor in the countryside; the district Party secretary and district head also carrying manure baskets or digging pigsties and planting sweet potatoes alongside the members; and in the past two days, seeing provincial Party secretaries weeding wheat in the fields in the newspaper, which further stirred up many warm feelings among the members.

Among the topics discussed by the members, the most prominent is the demand for democracy. Everyone particularly supports the Central Committee of the Communist Party's notice regarding the three measures for running cooperatives democratically; this Rectification Movement, which mainly opposes bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, is exactly what they need. They cite the water conservancy construction of the past two years as an example, comparing the leadership styles and fully expressing the harm of subjective leadership. The year before last, due to the cooperative's leadership using administrative orders to blindly concentrate labor on large-scale water diversion and irrigation projects, using more than 28,000 workdays from the entire cooperative, occupying 180 mu of land, and digging a large ditch eight or nine li long, the benefits were minimal. The result was a waste of manpower and resources, and the masses were dissatisfied. This year, they first consulted with the members, and based on their demands and opinions, straightened and widened the Liuqing River, which had caused harm year after year, and planted trees on both banks, not only avoiding the waterlogging and soil erosion on the riverbanks but also expanding the fertile land by more than 100 mu. When mentioning this project, the members all praised it.

The members deeply feel that even with correct policies and decisions from higher authorities, there must be a correct leadership style to implement them. Since agricultural cooperativization, many responsible comrades from the Central Committee, Provincial Party Committee, and Prefectural Party Committee have come from afar to specifically help solve many practical problems, which the members will never forget with gratitude. However, they also feel that many leading cadres are not doing this enough. They urgently hope that leading cadres at all levels can frequently go deep into the lower levels, get close to the masses, conduct investigations and research, and consult with the masses. During our contact with the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative and its members and cadres, we learned that they have two specific requests for the province or the central government:

The first is that they hope that the relevant departments of the province or the central government, in accordance with the State Council's instructions on developing small coal mines, will help the Zhuyuan small coal mine in Ju County overcome the current difficulties encountered in technology and other aspects, and produce coal as soon as possible to supply the rural areas. This small coal mine was abandoned in 1953, and only last winter did the Linyi Prefectural Commissioner's Office take charge of its restoration. It is said that the funds and labor for restoration and mining are not a problem, and if it is repaired, it can produce seven or eight thousand tons of coal this year. The biggest difficulty at present is the lack of technical strength, and no one can grasp the technical leadership. Rural areas lack firewood, and many farmers still have to rely on transporting coal from small coal mines in other counties hundreds of miles away.

The second thing is that they hope that the relevant departments of the province or the central government will consider allowing an appropriate amount of peanuts transported to other places for processing to be processed locally. Last year, Ju County transported all of the more than 27 million jin of peanuts purchased to Qingdao and other places for processing. Peanut cakes cost only five cents a jin in Ju County; however, when transported back from Qingdao and other places, plus transportation and packaging costs, it costs one dime a jin. If a portion of the peanuts transported out could be processed locally and changed to transporting a portion of peanut oil out, a large amount of transportation and packaging costs could be saved, and farmers could obtain cheaper peanut cakes for fine feed. The Ju County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has an oil press lying idle, and also has a power machine. As long as the higher authorities help add a spiral machine, a large amount of oil can be extracted. Members can also extract some oil using indigenous methods.

During our conversations with the members, we learned that they very much support the central government's instruction that all cadres should share weal and woe with the masses. The members hope that when leading cadres come to the countryside, in addition to talking to cadres, listening to reports, and giving instructions, they should also sit in the members' homes, chat about everyday life and their innermost thoughts. They feel somewhat regretful that some responsible cadres can only rush through the motions, making a quick tour and leaving. In addition, the members also hope that certain cadres and officers can use the spirit of the Rectification Movement to help their families in the countryside, so that they can also become leaders in the big family of the agricultural cooperative who love the cooperative, unite the masses, and manage their families diligently and thriftily; and not make them feel superior and detached from the masses.

The members have great expectations and confidence that cadres at all levels will change their leadership style and integrate with the masses. Lü Hongbin said: "After the Rectification Movement, the people will definitely be united more closely, and the cadres and the masses will definitely be able to unite as closely as they did during the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, as solid as iron ropes twisted together."

    来自沂蒙山区农村的呼声
    ——爱国农业社社员们对整风运动的期望	本报记者　肖彦  向村
    开展整风运动的消息传到了沂蒙山区的爱国农业生产合作社，这儿的干部和社员受到莫大的鼓舞。这些日子，社员们总爱传述一些触动人心的新事：县委书记带领县干部在乡下参加体力劳动；区委书记、区长也背起了粪筐或者和社员一块挖猪圈、栽甘薯；在前两天的报纸上，又看到省委书记们下地锄麦，更激起了社员们许多亲切之感。
    社员们谈论的话题中，最突出的是要求民主。对于中共中央关于民主办社三项措施的通知，大家特别拥护；这次整风运动主要是反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，对于他们来说也是正中下怀。他们举两年来的水利建设为例，对比了领导作风，充分地道出了主观主义领导的危害。前年，由于社的领导上用行政命令的办法盲目地把劳动力集中起来搞大型引水灌溉工程，用了全社两万八千多个工，占用了一百八十亩土地，挖了一条八、九里长的大沟，效益却很小，结果是劳民伤财，群众不满。今年首先和社员商量，根据社员们的要求和意见，修直和疏宽了年年为害的柳清河，两岸栽种了树木，不仅免除了河岸的涝灾和水土流失，而且扩大了一百多亩肥沃良田。提起这项工程，社员无不称道。
    社员们深深感到：上级有了正确的政策和决定，还得有正确的领导作风来贯彻执行。农业合作化以来，中央、省委、地委有不少负责同志远道而来，具体帮助解决很多实际问题，社员们都以感激的心情念念不忘。但是，他们还感觉到有许多领导干部这样做得还太少。他们迫切希望各级领导干部，都能经常地深入下层，接近群众，调查研究，同群众商量。我们在爱国农业社和社员、社干部接触中，了解到他们对省或中央还有两件具体的要求：
    头一件是希望省或中央有关部门，根据国务院关于发展小煤窑的指示，帮助莒县竹园小煤窑克服当前技术等方面遇到的困难，早日出煤，供应农村。这个小煤窑是1953年被废弃的，去年冬天才由临沂专署负责开始修复。据说，现在修复和开采的资金和劳动力都不成问题，修好了，今年内就能产七、八千吨煤。目前最大的困难是技术力量缺乏，没有人能掌握技术领导。农村缺烧柴，许多农民仍然要靠从几百里路的外县的小煤窑去运煤烧。
    第二件事是希望省或中央有关部门考虑，允许把运往外地加工的花生米，留适当数量在当地加工。莒县去年曾把收购到的二千七百多万斤花生米，全部运往青岛等地加工。花生饼在莒县只要五分钱一斤；可是再由青岛等地运回，加上运费、包装，就得一角钱一斤了。如果能够把往外运的花生米留下一部分就地加工，改成运部分花生油出去，就能节省大量运费和包装费，农民能得到较便宜的花生饼做精饲料。莒县供销社原有一部榨油机在闲着，也有动力机，只要上级帮助添置一部螺旋机，就可以大量榨油。社员利用土法，也还可以榨一部分油。
    我们在同社员们交谈中了解，他们对中央提出的要求所有干部都和群众同甘共苦的指示，非常拥护。社员们希望领导干部下乡来，除了找干部谈话、听汇报、作指示以外，也到社员家里坐坐，叙叙家常和心里话。对个别负责干部，只能匆匆忙忙走马观花，转一圈就走，觉得有些遗憾。另外，社员们还希望某些干部和军官也能以整风的精神，帮助自己在乡下的家属，让他们在农业社的大家庭里也能成为爱护农业社、团结群众、勤俭治家的带头人；不要使他们自认为高人一等，脱离群众。
    社员们对各级干部转变领导作风，和群众打成一片，是有很大期望的，也是有信心的。吕鸿宾说：“经过整风，人民内部一定会团结得更紧，干部和群众一定能同抗日战争、解放战争艰苦的年代里一样，打成一片，像铁绳扭在一起那样的结实。”
