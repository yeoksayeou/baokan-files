Some Jointly Operated Stores in Beijing Still Raise Commodity Prices Without Authorization

The commercial department of Qianmen District in Beijing conducted spot checks on some department stores, confectionery stores, and jointly operated and Lianjia stores selling oil and salt from the 10th to the 16th of this month, and found that the prices of many commodities had been raised without authorization.

During the spot check of the commodity prices of seven department stores in Meishi Street, three were found to have raised prices without authorization. For example, the price of a toothbrush in Qingxiangyuan Department Store was raised from 1 jiao to 1 jiao 5 fen, from 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen, and from 1 jiao 3 fen to 2 jiao. The white thread sold in Ruichanghe Department Store was originally 1 yuan 1 jiao per yard, but this store divided it into five strands for retail, selling each strand for 3 jiao 2 fen. Some stores not only raised the prices of clothes without authorization but also charged more cloth coupons.

Many confectionery and cake shops, under the pretext of saving sugar and grain, use substitutes to make sugar and cakes, reducing costs but not prices. For example, when making cakes, they replace sugar with small sugar, reduce the number of eggs, and add half a catty of filling (made of persimmon cakes or black dates) to a catty of cake, but the price is still 8 jiao 8 fen per catty. For example, the cost of 130 catties of beehive cake produced by Tianxingzhai Cake Shop is 32 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen. However, when sold at retail, it sells for 5 jiao 6 fen per catty, and the profit obtained exceeds 45% of the cost.

The above situation shows that Beijing's work of checking prices needs to be further deepened. ·Wang Ling·

    北京部分合营商店仍擅自提高商品价格
    北京市前门区的商业部门，于本月10日至16日的七天中，对一部分百货商店、糖果糕点店、油盐等公私合营和连家铺店进行了抽查，发现许多商品被擅自提高价格。
    在抽查煤市街内七户百货商店的商品价格时，就发现三户擅自提价。如庆祥原百货店的牙刷，由每只一角钱提高到一角五分，一角八分的提高到二角五分，一角三分的提高到二角。瑞昌和百货店卖的白线，本来是一元一角一码，但这个商店却分成五股零售，每股竟卖三角二分。有的商店在出售衣服的时候，不仅擅自提高了价格，还多收了布票。
    许多糖业糕点铺，借口节约砂糖、粮食，改用代用品制糖和糕点，成本降低了，价格却不降低。比如制做蛋糕时，将砂糖改用小糖、鸡蛋数量减少、一斤蛋糕夹进半斤馅（用柿饼或黑枣做馅），每斤售价仍然是八角八分。如天兴斋糕点铺自产的蜂糕，每一百三十斤，成本为三十二元一角二分。零售时每斤却卖五角六分，获得的利润超过成本45％以上。
    以上情况表明：北京市检查物价的工作还须深入一步。·王令·
