Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Kongcheng reports: Over one hundred oil painters, printmakers, and artists from other art departments in Beijing held a symposium for three consecutive days on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th. They believe that the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association have exhibited bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in leading art endeavors. They also criticized the People's Fine Arts Publishing House.

Many oil painters, printmakers, and some traditional Chinese painting artists disagreed with Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui's criticism of Jiang Feng, President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, for his alleged exclusion of traditional Chinese painting. Wu Zuoren, an oil painter and Vice President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said that the Central Academy of Fine Arts is under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, but Vice Minister Qian Junrui has never visited the academy even once. He drew conclusions about the academy's leadership excluding traditional Chinese painting based solely on reports from a few individuals. This leadership style is questionable. Li Hu, a lecturer in the traditional Chinese painting department at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said that Vice Minister Qian Junrui believes there is a "wrong trend" in the Central Academy of Fine Arts. In reality, the wrong trend exists not in the academy, but in society under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture. This wrong trend is that traditional Chinese painting does not need sketching, and learning sketching turns one into a nihilist. Liao Jingwen, Xu Beihong's widow, quoted Xu Beihong's words from his lifetime saying that it is a good tradition for students in the traditional Chinese painting department at the Central Academy of Fine Arts to learn sketching because sketching is the foundation of all plastic arts. Students in the traditional Chinese painting department must learn it. However, it is distressing to hear that the Ministry of Culture even wants to eliminate such a traditional Chinese painting department. It is not bad for students in the traditional Chinese painting department to mainly paint figures to express life. Many graduates of the traditional Chinese painting department are not satisfied with flowers, birds, and landscapes, but hope to express figures themselves. Here, it is necessary to see that it is an inevitable trend for traditional Chinese painting to absorb new blood and develop forward.

Many people also believe that Vice Minister Qian Junrui's accusation that President Jiang Feng is eliminating traditional Chinese painting is unfounded. Printmaker Yan Han cited many of Jiang Feng's articles to illustrate that he attaches great importance to Chinese landscape painting and flower-and-bird painting, and affirms that Chinese painting can fully reflect life. In practice, Jiang Feng mobilized everyone to create New Year pictures as early as the Yan'an Lu Xun Academy of Arts. After coming to Beijing, he personally negotiated with Rongbaozhai and other places regarding the publication of New Year pictures. New Year pictures are precisely a form of traditional Chinese painting. Zhou Juejun, from the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Culture, said that he was originally introduced to the Chinese Artists Association by the Provincial Bureau of Culture to study traditional Chinese painting. However, Comrade Zhong Ling of the Chinese Artists Association ignored him. Later, he found Jiang Feng, who not only introduced him to teachers but also provided him with much care in his life. Therefore, it is wrong to say that Jiang Feng does not value traditional Chinese painting. Jin Weinuo, a lecturer at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and others said that it is true that Jiang Feng did not do well in the United Front policy and that his working methods were simple and his attitude was stiff. However, the Ministry of Culture should not use this to stir up the masses' dissatisfaction with him. Wu Zuoren said that the criticism of Jiang Feng is excessive. Whether or not to learn sketching for traditional Chinese painting was originally an academic issue, but now it has become a personnel dispute. The Ministry of Culture should be responsible for this.

Some oil painters also believe that the development of oil painting has been suppressed. Oil painter Dong Xiwen said that the Ministry of Culture should not suppress oil painting by advocating traditional Chinese painting. Last year, when the Northwest Art College invited me, Wu Zuoren, and Wang Shikou to lecture, the Ministry of Culture did not let me go on the grounds of emphasizing traditional Chinese painting. Li Tiegen, an associate professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said that now those who study oil painting have become "illegitimate children." Oil painter Wang Liuqiu said: Previously, the Ministry of Culture planned to send some people to the Soviet Union to study oil painting, but now they are not allowed to go. Is there a contradiction between inheriting national heritage and learning oil painting?

Regarding the leadership of the Chinese Artists Association, painter Xi Ye called it "bureaucratized" and "officialized." He said that the leaders of the association lack new knowledge under the new circumstances, and the old set of knowledge is completely useless. Therefore, the leadership style appears dry and dogmatic, and the leaders are not united with each other. Not enough care and concern is given to some older comrades who engaged in art work in the past. Printmaker Ren Feng said, "I have been engaged in woodcut for eighteen years, but now I am very disheartened, because Cai Ruohong and Hua Junwu do not publish my paintings. Once, Cai Ruohong even said to me: 'You are no good, don't do it anymore.'" Traditional Chinese painter Huang Zhou called the association "officialdom," saying that once a comrade who drew cartoons from Shaanxi came to find Hua Junwu, but Hua Junwu only met with him once and was unwilling to meet with him a second time. Oil painter Zhuang Yan said that the association is rough in its treatment of painters' creations. They do not understand the painters' creations, but they like to "criticize." When the state implemented unified purchase and sales, Hua Junwu and Cai Ruohong criticized the paintings that I and Xin Mang drew, saying that this should be like this, that should be like that, and so on. Because our creations did not follow the leadership's intentions, these paintings had no way out. A painting I drew reflecting graduates participating in labor was said by Cai Ruohong to uglify the working people, using the reason that graduates not being able to go to college was a phenomenon of the past. He told me to discuss it in connection with Hu Feng's thought. I did not agree and requested to talk to the Central Propaganda Department, but he told me to talk to the court.

Many people brought up several facts about the People's Fine Arts Publishing House exhibiting sectarianism and subjectivism. Woodcut artist Yan Han and painter Qin Zheng said that Shao Yu, the deputy director of the publishing house, is sectarian. In order to squeeze out the painters Gu Yuan and Zhang Fanfu, he canceled the creation team attached to the publishing house under the pretext of professionalizing writers. This made Gu Yuan's environment continuously unstable, and Zhang Fanfu was transferred to the Northeast. Yan Han also said that Shao Yu's own works, such as "Land," "Sketches of the Capital," and "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," were published a lot. Even his small ink paintings were engraved in Rongbaozhai, but the works of others were rarely published. The works of some painters have been suppressed for four or five years without any opportunity for publication. Gu Yuan's collection of prints was carved by the author with half his life's energy, and the royalties were only 400 yuan, while the "Art Diary" compiled by the publishing house itself was just compiling other people's works, and the editing fee was 1,000 yuan. Liu Xun, Wo Zha, and others also criticized Shao Yu for unreasonably suspending the oil painting advanced studies class. The oil painting advanced studies class was automatically organized in the publishing house by some old painters in order to improve their painting skills, and it had already obtained the approval of the Ministry of Culture before its establishment.

At the meeting, Hong Bo, the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and Ding Jingwen, the principal of the academy's affiliated high school, and others believed that the People's Daily's report on the 24th regarding the academy's leadership excluding traditional Chinese painting was partially inconsistent with the facts.

Participants in this meeting also included Vice Ministers of Culture Liu Zhiming, Xia Yan, Chen Kehan, Deputy Director of the Literature and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Su Yiping, and individual leaders of the Chinese Artists Association.

### 北京美术家举行座谈会  批评文化部领导工作中的缺点

    北京美术家举行座谈会
    批评文化部领导工作中的缺点
    本报特约稿　新华社记者王孔诚报道：北京的油画家、版画家和其他美术部门的美术家共一百多人，在23、24、25三天连续举行座谈会，认为文化部和中国美术家协会在领导美术事业上存在着官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，同时对人民美术出版社提出了批评。
    许多油画家、版画家和个别彩墨画家，都不同意文化部副部长钱俊瑞对中央美术学院院长江丰排斥国画的批评。油画家、中央美术学院副院长吴作人说，中央美术学院是属于文化部领导的，可是钱俊瑞副部长就一次也没有来过，只根据个别人的汇报就下结论说学院领导上排斥国画。这种领导方式是值得考虑的。中央美术学院彩墨画系讲师李斛说，钱俊瑞副部长认为中央美术学院存在着一股“歪风”，实际上有歪风的不是学院，而是在文化部这种领导下，社会上存在着一种歪风，就是国画不要素描，学了素描就变成了虚无主义。徐悲鸿夫人廖静文引证徐悲鸿生前的话说，中央美术学院彩墨画系学生学素描是一种优良的传统，因为素描是一切造型艺术的基础。彩墨画系的学生不能不学它。可是听说文化部竟然要取消这样的彩墨画系，是令人感到很痛心的。彩墨画系的学生画画以人物为主去表现生活也没有什么不好，有许多彩墨画系毕业出来的学生并不满足于花鸟、山水，而希望自己去表现好人物。这里，必须看到国画吸取新的血液，向前发展，是必然的趋势。
    不少的人还认为钱俊瑞副部长关于江丰院长消灭国画的指责是没有根据的。版画家彦涵引证了江丰的许多文章说明他非常重视中国的山水画、花鸟画，并且肯定了中国画完全可以反映生活。在实践上，江丰早在延安鲁迅艺术学院时就发动大家搞年画，来北京后也还亲自到荣宝斋等处去交涉年画的出版事宜。而年画正就是国画的一种形式。来自安徽省文化局的周觉钧说，原先他是被省文化局介绍给中国美术家协会学国画的。可是中国美术家协会的钟灵同志不理他。后来，他找到了江丰，江丰不光给他介绍了教师，还给他生活上许多照顾。所以说江丰不重视国画是不对的。中央美术学院讲师金维诺和其它一些人说，江丰在统战政策上作的不好，工作方式简单、态度生硬这是事实，可是文化部却不应以此去挑起群众对他的不满。吴作人说，对于江丰的批评是过分的。学国画不要素描，本来是一个学术问题，可是现在却成了人事上的争论了。这点文化部应当负责。
    有些油画家还认为油画的发展受到了压制。油画家董希文说，文化部不应当借着提倡国画就压制油画，去年西北艺术专科学校请我和吴作人、王式廓去讲学时，文化部就以重视国画为理由不让我去。中央美术学院副教授李铁根说，现在学油画的成了“私生子”。油画家王流秋说：从前文化部准备派一些人去苏联学油画，现在也不让去了，难道继承民族遗产和学油画有矛盾吗？
    关于中国美术家协会的领导，画家西野称为“机关化”“官僚化”。他说，协会的领导人在新的情况下，缺乏新的知识，而旧的一套又完全用不上，所以领导方式显得干瘪而又教条，领导者之间也不团结。对过去搞美术工作的一些老同志照顾、关怀不够。版画家刃锋说，我搞木刻已经十八年了，可是现在却很寒心，因为蔡若虹、华君武都不发表我的画，有一次蔡若虹还对我说：“你不行了，不要搞了。”国画家黄胄称协会是“衙门化”，他说有一次一个陕西来的画漫画的同志找华君武，可是华君武只接见他第一次就不愿意接见他第二次。油画家庄言说，协会在对待画家的创作上是粗暴的，他们对画家的创作并不了解，但却喜欢“批评”，在国家实行统购统销时，我和辛莽画的画，华君武和蔡若虹就乱指责，说这里应当是这样，那里应当是那样等等。由于我们创作未按领导意图办事，结果这些画都没有出路。我画的一张反映毕业生参加劳动的画，蔡若虹用毕业生不能升学是过去的现象为理由，说我丑化了劳动人民，叫我联系胡风思想谈，我不同意，要求到中央宣传部谈，但他却叫我到法院去谈。
    许多人提出了人民美术出版社表现为宗派主义主观主义的若干事实。木刻家彦涵和画家秦征说，出版社的副社长邵宇有宗派主义，他为了排挤画家古元和张凡夫，借口作家职业化而取消了附属在出版社内的创作组。使得古元的环境一直不安定，张凡夫则被调到东北去。彦涵还说出版社中邵宇自己的作品如“土地”“首都速写”“万水千山”等出的很多，甚至他的小品水墨画都在荣宝斋刻版，可是别人的就出版的很少。有的画家的作品还被压了四、五年而一直未有出版的机会。古元的版画集是作者用半生的精力刻成的，稿费只给四百元，而出版社自己编的“美术日记”不过是编了一下别人的作品，编辑费就是一千元。刘迅、沃渣等人并批评邵宇无理停办油画进修班的事件。油画进修班是一些老画家为了提高自己的绘画技巧而自动在出版社中组织起来的，成立之前已经取得了文化部的批准。
    在会议上，中央美术学院的党总支副书记洪波和学院附中的校长丁井文等认为24日的人民日报对学院领导关于排斥国画的新闻部分是不符合事实的。
    这次会议的参加者还有文化部副部长刘芝明、夏衍、陈克寒和中共中央宣传部文艺处副处长苏一萍、中国美术家协会的个别领导人。
