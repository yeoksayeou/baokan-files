Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 15th: Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by President Sukarno, arrived in Surabaya, the capital of East Java province, at 10 o'clock this morning from Bali, and was greeted by a million people lining the streets. The two heads of state then attended a mass rally in front of the East Java Provincial Governor's Office Square, attended by 400,000 people.

In his speech, Voroshilov expressed his hope that the Indonesian people would unite to continue to eliminate foreign forces and recover West Irian. He once again expressed the Soviet Union's support for Indonesia's demand for the recovery of West Irian.

He said that we visited China before visiting Indonesia. China is a beautiful country. This largest country in Asia has freed itself from the rule of colonialism and imperialism and achieved complete independence. With the help of people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, China has achieved brilliant achievements in economic and cultural construction, especially in heavy industry. This proves that the colonial countries' argument that Asian countries cannot build their countries without the participation of imperialism is a lie.

Voroshilov also said that the Soviet Union and Indonesia have a common attitude towards China's legitimate status in the international community. He added that the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate with all nations in the world in the development of economy, culture, and science. The Soviet Union advocates peaceful coexistence among all nations and respects their right to decide their own destiny.

President Sukarno said at the meeting that people all over the world love peace. They welcome the ideas of peace and humanitarianism, but others are creating hatred and hostility.

After the meeting, President Sukarno accompanied the distinguished guests to visit the bullfighting performance. The two heads of state are scheduled to return to Jakarta this afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 15th: Chairman Voroshilov and President Sukarno have returned to Jakarta by plane from Surabaya this afternoon. Voroshilov and his entourage will go to Medan, North Sumatra tomorrow morning. Voroshilov, who has experienced a long visit, looked very energetic today. After leaving Cipanas on May 10, he visited Bandung, Yogyakarta, Solo, Batang and Surabaya.

    泗水百万群众夹道迎嘉宾
    伏老重申支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安
    新华社雅加达15日电　伏罗希洛夫主席在苏加诺总统陪同下，今天早上十点钟从巴厘到达东爪哇省省会泗水，受到当地一百万群众夹道欢迎。两位元首接着出席了在东爪哇省省长公署前面广场上有四十万人参加的群众大会。
    伏罗希洛夫在讲话中表示希望印度尼西亚人民为继续消灭外国势力和收复西伊里安而团结起来。他再一次表示苏联支持印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的要求。
    他说，我们在访问印度尼西亚之前访问了中国。中国是一个美丽的国家。这个亚洲最大的国家已经摆脱殖民主义和帝国主义的统治，取得完全的独立。在人民民主国家以及苏联的帮助下，中国在经济、文化等方面的建设已经获得辉煌成就，特别是在重工业方面。这证明了殖民国家所说的亚洲国家没有帝国主义的参加是不能建设国家的论调是一个谎话。
    伏罗希洛夫还说，苏联和印度尼西亚对中国在国际上的合法地位有共同态度。他又说，苏联愿意同世界各民族在发展经济、文化、科学方面合作。苏联主张各民族和平共处，尊重各自决定自己命运的权利。
    苏加诺总统在会上说，全世界人民都热爱和平。他们欢迎和平和人道主义的思想，但是另外还有人在制造仇视和敌对。
    大会结束以后，苏加诺总统陪同贵宾参观了斗牛表演。两位元首定在今天下午回到雅加达。
    新华社雅加达15日电　伏罗希洛夫主席和苏加诺总统已经在今天下午从泗水乘飞机回到雅加达。伏罗希洛夫和他的随行人员明天早上将去北苏门答腊棉兰。经历了漫长访问行程的伏罗希洛夫今天显得精神十分好。他在5月10日离开吉帕纳斯以后，曾经访问了万隆、日惹、梭罗、巴塘和泗水等地。
