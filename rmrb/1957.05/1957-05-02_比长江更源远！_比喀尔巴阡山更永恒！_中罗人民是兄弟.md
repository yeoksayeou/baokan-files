    More Ancient Than the Yangtze!
    More Eternal Than the Carpathian Mountains!
    The Chinese and Romanian Peoples are Brothers
    Respected Comrade C. Pavelescu:
    Respected Comrades of the Delegation:
    When we read in the newspapers that you had come to our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the passion in our hearts was beyond words. The people of Beijing are welcoming you, and the bright spring in Beijing is also welcoming you—the envoys of the great Romanian people. We wish you good health and a happy spirit during your visit to our country.
    We are among the first students to learn your language in our own country. At the beginning, we encountered many difficulties, but we deeply understand that the growing friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples urgently requires us to act as a bridge; at the same time, we also learned that Romanian is one of the most beautiful languages ​​in the world; your every achievement in construction is also encouraging us to move forward. We have a firm determination and a hundredfold confidence to overcome the difficulties in learning and master Romanian well.
    Through the study of Romanian geography, we have learned that Romania is a very rich and beautiful country. We seem to see the rolling wheat waves of the Blue Danube Plain; we also seem to smell the oil fragrance of Ploiesti. We love the Romanian language, we also love your country, and we love your hardworking and brave people even more.
    Over the past year, we have achieved many results in our studies, and these achievements are inseparable from the earnest teachings of our expert, Comrade Diaconescu. Every progress we make is thanks to his efforts. His spirit of tireless teaching deeply moved us and made our enthusiasm for learning even higher. He is our respected teacher and our closest friend. Here, we sincerely thank your government for sending us such a cultural envoy.
    In our studies, difficulties such as the lack of dictionaries and textbooks have been placed before us; but thanks to the support and help of your party and government, which constantly send us books and magazines to assist our studies, this has created favorable learning conditions for us. Here, we also express our sincere gratitude.
    Dear Comrades, when you visit our country, you must have seen six hundred million pairs of enthusiastic hands extended to you; you must have heard the thunderous voice—the Chinese and Romanian peoples are brothers! The friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples is more ancient than the Yangtze River and more eternal than the Carpathian Mountains.
    Dear friends, please bring our sincere friendship and high respect to the Romanian youth, and please bring our cordial greetings to the Romanian people.
              All the Students Majoring in Romanian at Beijing Foreign Languages Institute
                                                  May 1, 1957

    比长江更源远！
    比喀尔巴阡山更永恒！
    中罗人民是兄弟
    敬爱的康·帕伏列斯库主席同志：
    敬爱的代表团全体同志们：
    当我们从报纸上看到了你们应我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和北京市人民委员会的邀请，来到我国作友好访问的消息时，我们内心的激情是难以言喻的。北京人民在欢迎你们，北京明媚的春天也在欢迎你们——伟大的罗马尼亚人民的使者。愿你们在我国访问期间身体健康，精神愉快。
    我们是第一批在自己的祖国学习你们的语言的学生。开始时，遇到了很多困难，但我们深深地懂得中罗人民友谊日益发展迫切需要我们去起桥梁作用；同时我们也了解到罗马尼亚语是世界上最优美的语言之一；你们的每一个建设成就也在鼓舞着我们前进。我们有坚定的决心和百倍的信心去克服学习上的困难，学好罗语。
    通过罗马尼亚地理课的学习，使我们知道了罗马尼亚是一个非常富饶美丽的国家。我们似乎看到了蓝色多瑙河平原的起伏的麦浪；我们也好像闻到了普罗也什蒂的石油香。我们热爱罗语，我们也热爱你们的祖国，我们更热爱你们勤劳勇敢的人民。
    一年来，我们在学习上取得了很多的成绩，这些成绩的获得是与我们的专家迪亚康尼司库同志谆谆地教导分不开的。我们的每一个进步都有他的心血。他那诲人不倦的精神深深地感动了我们，使我们的学习热情更加高涨了。他是我们敬爱的老师，也是我们最亲密的朋友。在这里我们衷心地感谢你们的政府为我们派来了这样一位文化的使者。
    在我们的学习中没有字典、缺少教材等等困难都曾摆在我们面前；但由于你们的党和政府的支持和帮助，不断给我们寄来书刊、杂志辅助我们的学习，这就给我们创造了有利的学习条件，在这里我们也表示衷心地感激。
    亲爱的同志们，当你们光临我们国家的时候，该看到了六万万双热情的手伸向你们；该听到了春雷似的声音——中罗人民是兄弟！中罗人民的友谊比长江更源远，比喀尔巴阡山更永恒。
    亲爱的朋友们，请你们把我们真挚的友谊和崇高的敬意带给罗马尼亚青年，请你们把我们亲切的问候带给罗马尼亚人民。
              北京外国语学院罗马尼亚语专业全体同学上
                                                  1957、5、1、
