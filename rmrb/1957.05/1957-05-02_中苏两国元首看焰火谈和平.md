Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Voroshilov watched the fireworks and the mass carnival in Tiananmen Square on the Tiananmen Gate tower this evening. The heads of the two great countries sat side by side tonight. With them were Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as Rakhidov, Yelyutin, Fedin, Yudin, who accompanied Voroshilov on his visit to China, Chairman of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, Con Pǎvulescu, and Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities of the Union of Burma, Sao Hkun Hkio, and his wife.

Although they had stood for three hours during the day inspecting the 500,000-strong parade in Beijing, Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Voroshilov were in particularly good spirits this evening. Voroshilov watched the fireworks and the mass carnival in the square with rapt attention. He talked with Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and others from time to time, praising the variety of the fireworks. Voroshilov was very interested in the chain fireworks. He said to Chairman Mao: "This kind of fireworks is like a volcanic eruption or a fountain. If such good fireworks were set off in Moscow, I don't know how many people would be attracted to watch!" Chairman Voroshilov also said: "This is the first time I have seen such good fireworks from such a close distance. However, I have experienced a lot of artillery fire." Chairman Voroshilov pointed to the night sky over Tiananmen, illuminated like daytime by colorful sparks and searchlights, and said to Chairman Mao: "If all countries in the world reach an agreement on the issue of arms reduction, I don't know how much gunpowder would be saved to make fireworks. Then there would be endless fireworks to set off!" Chairman Mao nodded repeatedly in agreement.

Tonight, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou also met with the heads of delegations and famous people from more than 40 countries, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, who were watching the fireworks and the mass carnival in Tiananmen Square on the Tiananmen Gate tower, to express their welcome. Friends from all countries expressed to Chairman Mao and others the desire of the people of their countries to be friendly with the Chinese people. Some Japanese women representatives said to Chairman Mao almost in unison: Friendly seeds between the Chinese and Japanese people can also be sown through women. Chairman Mao said: "Yes, friendly cooperation between the two countries can be developed through women."

    中苏两国元首看焰火谈和平
    伏罗希洛夫主席说：“如果世界各国就关于裁减军备问题达成协议的话，不晓得要节省出多少火药来制造焰火，那时焰火将会放也放不完！”
    新华社1日讯　毛泽东主席同伏罗希洛夫主席今晚在天安门城楼上观看了焰火和天安门广场上的群众大联欢。两个伟大国家的元首今晚并肩地坐着。同他们在一起的还有朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理，以及随同伏老访问中国的拉希多夫、叶留金、费德林、尤金，罗马尼亚大国民议会主席康·帕伏列斯库，缅甸联邦民族院议长萧恢塔和夫人等。
    虽然白天站了三个小时检阅了北京市五十万游行队伍，但毛泽东主席和伏罗希洛夫主席今晚精神特别好。伏老全神贯注地欣赏焰火和广场上的群众大联欢。他不时和毛主席、朱副主席、刘委员长、周总理等交谈，称赞焰火的多采。伏老对连珠焰火很感兴趣，他向毛主席说：“这种焰火像火山爆发也像喷泉。如果在莫斯科放这样好的焰火，不知道会吸引多少人去观看呢！”伏罗希洛夫主席还说：“在这样近的地方看这样好的焰火，我还是第一次。但是，对于炮火我却经历得很多了。”伏罗希洛夫主席又指着被多采的火花和探照灯照射得如同白昼的天安门夜空对毛主席说：“如果世界各国就关于裁减军备问题达成协议的话，不晓得要节省出多少火药来制造焰火，那时焰火将会放也放不完！”毛主席连连点头表示同意。
    今晚，毛主席、朱副主席、刘委员长和周总理还同在天安门城楼上观看焰火和天安门广场群众大联欢的来自四十多个国家的代表团负责人和著名人士以及各国驻华使节一一见面表示欢迎。各国的朋友们都向毛主席等表达了各国人民愿意同中国人民友好的愿望。一些日本妇女代表几乎异口同声地向毛主席说：通过妇女也可以播下中日两国人民友好的种子。毛主席说：“对的，通过妇女是可以发展两国之间的友好合作的。”
