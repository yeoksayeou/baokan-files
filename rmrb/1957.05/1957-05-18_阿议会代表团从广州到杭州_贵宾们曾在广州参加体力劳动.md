Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency reports, members of the People's Assembly delegation from the People's Republic of Albania, headed by Chairman Rita Marko, participated in physical labor at a sewer construction site in the northeast of Guangzhou on the morning of the 16th. After seeing the directive from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding leading personnel at all levels participating in physical labor in the newspaper on their way to Guangzhou on the 15th, the delegation proactively requested to participate in physical labor.

As soon as the distinguished guests arrived at the construction site, they immediately took off their coats, rolled up their sleeves, and joined the Chinese workers with tools. Chairman Rita Marko also actively engaged in a labor competition with Guangzhou Mayor Zhu Guang, who was digging soil alongside him.

On the morning of the 17th, the distinguished guests left Guangzhou by special plane and arrived in Hangzhou at noon that day, where they were warmly welcomed by Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wu Xian, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province and Mayor of Hangzhou, Song Yunbin, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and responsible persons of the Zhejiang local organizations of various democratic parties.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, Cheng Zihua, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and member of Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, accompanied the delegation to Hangzhou.

The guests received bouquets presented by the Young Pioneers at the airport. Nearly three hundred people welcoming them at the airport continuously shouted slogans such as "Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people!"

Chairman Marko, accompanied by Jiang Hua, walked past the welcoming crowds, and then got into a car with Jiang Hua to go to the hotel to rest. (Attached picture)

    阿议会代表团从广州到杭州
    贵宾们曾在广州参加体力劳动
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：以里塔·马尔科主席为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会代表团成员16日上午到广州市东北部的一个下水道工地参加了体力劳动。代表团15日来广州途中在报纸上看到了中共中央关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示以后，就主动提出了参加体力劳动的要求。
    贵宾们一到工地，就马上脱了外衣，卷上衣袖，接过工具和中国工人一起劳动。里塔·马尔科主席还主动与同他并肩挖土的广州市朱光市长进行劳动竞赛。
    17日早晨，贵宾们乘专机离开广州，于当日中午到达杭州，受到中共浙江省委第一书记江华，浙江省副省长、杭州市市长吴宪，政协浙江省委员会副主席宋云彬和各民主党派浙江省地方组织负责人等的热烈欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使巴利里，中共中央委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员程子华等陪同代表团到杭州。
    客人们在机场上接受了少年先锋队员们的献花。在机场欢迎的近三百群众不断高呼“中阿两国人民永恒的友谊万岁”等口号。
