Young Students Learn Skills from Veteran Artisans

Tianjin’s wood carving veteran artisan Liu Xinglin, brick carving veteran artisan Liu Fengming, and Zhang Jingxi, a descendant of Clay Figure Zhang, are planning to recruit young students with junior high or higher elementary school education to learn their crafts. Seven students, introduced by the Tianjin Heping District Democratic Youth Federation, visited these three artisans and were warmly received. The veteran artisans also told these students that if they were determined to learn these handicrafts, they would teach them well.

These seven students were all out of school last year, some being higher elementary school graduates, some junior high graduates, and some students from the first or second year of junior high school. After visiting the old artisans' studios and works, they also held a discussion. Four of them expressed their willingness to learn the crafts from the old artisans on the spot. Er Shihua, a higher elementary school graduate, said excitedly: "I am very interested in arts and crafts and I am willing to learn the craft," and he expressed his hope to learn wood carving. Li Banggui, a second-year junior high school student, has loved clay sculpture since he was a child and has consulted Zhang Jingxi many times. Yesterday, he carefully watched the clay figure works and said happily: "I really want to create something like this, and I am determined to learn this craft."

    青年学生向老手艺人学艺
    天津市木雕老艺人刘杏林、刻砖老艺人刘凤鸣和泥人张的后代张景禧，最近将要招收一些具有初中或高小文化程度的青年学生学艺。七个学生经天津市和平区民主青年联合会介绍，拜访了这三位艺人，受到老艺人们的热情接待。老艺人们还告诉这些学生们说：要是他们决心学这行手工艺，自己一定要好好教他们。
    这七个学生，都是去年停学在家的，有的是高小毕业生，有的是初中毕业生，有的是初中一、二年级的学生。他们参观了老艺人的工作室和作品以后，还进行了座谈，其中有四个人当场表示愿意向老艺人们学手艺。高小毕业生尔世华兴奋地说：我对工艺美术品很有兴趣，愿意学艺，他并提出希望学习木雕。初中二年级学生李邦贵，从小就喜爱泥塑，曾经向张景禧请教过多次，昨天他认真观摩了泥人作品，高兴地说：我真想捏出这样的东西，我决心要学这行了。
