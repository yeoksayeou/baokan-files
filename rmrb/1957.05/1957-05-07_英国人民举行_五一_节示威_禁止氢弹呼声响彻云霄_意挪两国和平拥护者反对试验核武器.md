    Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th May: Thousands of London residents held May Day demonstrations on the first Sunday of May yesterday, demanding an end to hydrogen bomb testing and the removal of American atomic bomb bases from Britain.
    Waving colorful flags, banners, and huge caricatures, the marchers passed through the streets of central London and entered Hyde Park, where the Communist Party and the Labour Party held two mass rallies respectively. The marchers sang songs and shouted slogans: "Ban the hydrogen bomb," "The Conservative Party must go," "Let the people of all colonies be independent," "Peace and friendship with the people of all countries." Hundreds of thousands of people applauded and cheered them.
    The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Gollan, delivered a speech at the mass rally. He advocated that Macmillan go to Moscow to talk with Bulganin. He said that if the Soviet Union and Britain jointly proposed to the United States a suggestion to end all kinds of tests, it would create an irresistible public pressure that the United States could not refuse. This would be the beginning of eliminating the atomic threat.
    The rally attracted more and more people, and the speakers were repeatedly interrupted by applause and cheers.
    Another mass rally also attracted a large crowd. Labour MP Callaghan said at the meeting, "For the future of mankind, the world's politicians should no longer delay on the issue of controlling hydrogen bombs and disarmament."
    Glasgow, the industrial center of Britain, held its first joint May Day demonstration in six years on the 4th. There, trade union members, Labour Party and Communist Party members marched side by side. Frank Cousins, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, spoke at a joint mass rally, condemning the manufacture and testing of hydrogen bombs. He reiterated the recent demand of the British Trades Union Congress to nationalize the shipbuilding and machine industries.
    In many other places, the most notable slogans of the May Day demonstrations were also the demand to stop hydrogen bomb testing and ban the hydrogen bomb.
    Labour MP Aneurin Bevan spoke at the May Day rally in Reading on the evening of the 5th, expressing his opposition to hydrogen bomb testing. He said: "No matter what weapon, as long as it is also a suicide weapon, it cannot become a diplomatic weapon."
    The British Peace Committee issued an appeal on the 5th, calling on the people of the country to sign a petition against hydrogen bomb testing.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th May: According to a TASS report from Rome on the 5th: "Unità" reported that Italian peace supporters are launching a campaign against atomic armaments and striving for an immediate cessation of thermonuclear weapons testing.
    Regional conferences have been held in Milan, Genoa, Turin, and other places, at which many issues concerning the opposition to the atomic arms race were discussed. Peace supporters in the city of Genoa and the province of Genoa have also distributed a booklet among residents containing the declaration of the World Peace Council and the statement of scientists against atomic weapons. In Bologna, Forlì, and Ravenna, leaflets protesting the manufacture and use of atomic weapons are also being distributed among residents.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th May: Oslo News: Norway has begun a signature campaign against atomic weapons testing. This signature campaign was launched on the 2nd by the Liberal Party's "Dagbladet" to respond to Dr. Schweizer's recent appeal on Oslo Radio. In Oslo, the Norwegian capital, alone, 6,000 people signed the petition against atomic weapons on the 3rd, and several thousand more signed on the 4th and 5th. This movement will also be carried out throughout the country.

    英国人民举行“五一”节示威
    禁止氢弹呼声响彻云霄
    意挪两国和平拥护者反对试验核武器
    新华社伦敦6日电  数以千计的伦敦居民昨天在5月的第一个星期天举行“五一”节示威，要求停止氢弹试验和取消美国在英国的原子弹基地。
    游行者高举着彩色旗帜、标语以及巨幅漫画经过伦敦中部的街道，进入海德公园，在那里，共产党和工党分别举行两个群众大会。游行的人们唱着歌并且高呼口号：“禁止氢弹”、“保守党必须滚蛋”、“让各个殖民地的人民独立”、“同各国人民和平友好”。成千上万的人向他们鼓掌欢呼。
    英共总书记高兰在群众大会上发表演说，他主张麦克米伦到莫斯科去同布尔加宁会谈，他说，如果苏英两国联合向美国提出结束各种试验的建议，那就会产生一种不可抗拒的公众压力，使美国无法拒绝。这将是消除原子核威胁的开端。
    大会吸引了越来越多的人，讲话的人一再为掌声和欢呼声所打断。
    另一个群众大会也吸引了大量人群。工党议员卡拉汉在会上说，“为了人类的前途，世界上的政治家不应当再在控制氢弹和裁军问题上拖延了”。
    英国工业中心格拉斯哥在4日举行了六年来第一次的“五一”节联合示威。在那里，工会会员、工党和共产党党员并肩游行。运输与不熟练工人工会总书记弗兰克·卡曾斯在联合群众大会上讲话，谴责制造和试验氢弹。他重新提出了英国职工大会最近提出的把造船业和机器工业收归国有的要求。
    在其他许多地方举行的“五一”节示威，最引人注意的口号也是要求停止试验氢弹和禁止氢弹的口号。
    工党议员安奈林·比万5日晚上在里丁的“五一”节大会上讲话，表示反对氢弹试验。他说：“无论什么武器，只要是同时又是自杀武器，就不可能成为外交武器。”
    英国和平委员会5日发出呼吁，要求全国人民在反对试验氢弹的请愿书上签名。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社罗马5日讯：“团结报”报道：意大利的和平拥护者正在开展一个反对原子军备，争取立即停止试验热核武器的宣传运动。
    在米兰、热那亚和都灵等地，都举行了地区性会议，会上讨论了反对原子军备竞赛的许多问题。热那亚市和热那亚省的和平拥护者还在居民中散发了一本小册子，里面有世界和平理事会的宣言和科学家反对原子武器的声明。在波伦亚、弗利和拉温那，抗议制造和使用原子武器的传单也正在居民当中传播。
    新华社6日讯　奥斯陆消息：挪威已经开始了一个反对原子武器试验的签名运动。这个签名运动是自由党的“日报”在2日发起的，目的在响应施维泽尔博士不久前在奥斯陆广播电台发出的号召。仅在挪威首都奥斯陆，在3日就有六千人在反对原子武器请愿书上签了名，在4日和5日又有几千人签名。这个运动还要在全国各地进行。
