How to Treat Mistakes? How to Treat Criticism?
Editor's Note: On March 29th, this newspaper published an article by Comrade Yi Nong titled "Learn from Last Year's Experience to Better Promote Agricultural Production Increase Measures," which mentioned the mistakes that occurred last year in Hubei and Hunan in promoting the "Aomori No. 5" japonica rice. Comrade Yi Nong believes that this incident, like many other failures, was "unavoidable in new things," "however, it also received excessive criticism and accusations, hurting the emotions of cadres and the masses." After the publication of this article, we received an article from Comrade Zhiyan, expressing different opinions on this point mentioned in Comrade Yi Nong's article, titled "How to View the 'Aomori No. 5' Incident?" published in the "Reading the Newspaper Jottings" column on April 14th, third edition. Comrade Yi Nong then wrote a "Response to Comrade Zhiyan's Opinions," which this newspaper published on April 18th. Comrade Zhiyan and some other comrades believe that Comrade Yi Nong's "Response" still has some incorrect points. Now we are publishing the opinions of Comrade Zhiyan and other comrades here.
	
Will Criticism Damage Cadres' Enthusiasm?
	
"…In addition, the leadership cadres' level in rural work and agricultural work is not high enough, and there are still subjectivism and bureaucratism. Therefore, it is understandable and unavoidable to suffer some failures in the promotion of agricultural production increase measures (including the promotion of 'Aomori No. 5')." - These are two sentences from Comrade Yi Nong's "Response to Comrade Zhiyan's Opinions" (see People's Daily, April 18th). I don't know how other comrades understand these two sentences, but I find them really difficult to understand.
	
Due to the complexity of objective circumstances and the lack of experience of cadres, it is indeed unavoidable to have occasional errors in the work of promoting production increase measures. However, can it be said that every specific error is unavoidable? To say that the unavoidable reason is that the leadership cadres still have bureaucratism and subjectivism, does this mean that the bureaucratism and subjectivism of the leadership cadres are also unavoidable? If it is said that the bureaucratism and subjectivism of the leadership cadres are indeed unavoidable, then shouldn't we forgive these bureaucratism and subjectivism? And how can bureaucratism and subjectivism be forgiven?
	
The promotion of "Aomori No. 5" japonica rice caused reduced rice production in many places in Hunan. This specific error was obviously not an unavoidable error.
	
The main purpose of discussing this matter now is not for the "Aomori No. 5" incident itself, but more importantly, how to "treat shortcomings and errors." Comrade Yi Nong's opinion has a relatively long section specifically discussing this issue, and I also think this issue is worth raising for discussion. Whether the agricultural leadership department has expressed any attitude towards "Aomori No. 5," and whether it should be further examined and discussed, can be discussed separately. What needs to be discussed here are some of Comrade Yi Nong's views on "how to treat shortcomings and errors."
	
Comrade Yi Nong also believes that "for things that have been done badly and people who have made mistakes, giving appropriate criticism is something that no one should oppose"; "it is not permissible to hold a forgiving attitude towards mistakes, let alone cover them up." However, he immediately said: "At the same time, we should also strive to avoid excessive criticism and accusations." What is meant by "excessive criticism and accusations"? This question is worth studying. Has there been "excessive criticism and accusations" for the mistakes caused by the promotion of "Aomori No. 5"? I only saw the report on the investigation of this incident by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Supervision published in the People's Daily on October 12th last year. The editorial published in the People's Daily on the same day only mentioned the "Aomori No. 5" incident and did not "excessively accuse" it specifically. In other newspapers, I have not seen "excessive criticism and accusations" about this matter. Among the masses of farmers in Hunan and Hubei provinces, criticisms and accusations about this matter may continue to be issued, but can we teach the farmers who suffered losses because of this that they should not have "excessive criticism and accusations"? A reader of the People's Daily, Comrade Zhiyan, wrote a "Reading the Newspaper Jottings," and also talked about the "Aomori No. 5" incident, which was published in the People's Daily. The newspaper had already talked about "Aomori No. 5" in the past, and after several months, it is talking about this matter again, which seems a bit like "excessive criticism and accusations." However, before Comrade Zhiyan wrote this jottings, Comrade Yi Nong had already declared that the criticism of the mistake of promoting "Aomori No. 5" last year was "excessive." In fact, Comrade Zhiyan's criticism is no longer about the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" last year, but about Comrade Yi Nong's opinions on how to treat mistakes and how to treat criticism.
	
There is also the issue of the timing of criticism. I agree that criticism should be timed. Because the purpose of criticism is to strengthen unity and improve work. If, under certain circumstances, criticism is detrimental to work and unity, then we should wait for an appropriate time. However, can it be said that, under normal circumstances, when there are more right-leaning conservative situations in actual work, even if there are cases of blind rashness, there is no need to criticize them? That may not be realistic, right? I think that the past propaganda in the newspapers had this problem. When opposing "left" leaning, the entire page was filled with opposition to "left" leaning, even if there were some right-leaning tendencies in actual work, they were ignored. When the right-leaning tendency developed into a dominant position, they blindly opposed right-leaning again, even if there were still some "left" leaning tendencies in actual work, they were not pointed out. Doing so may not be very beneficial to the work, right? Comrade Yi Nong said: Currently, in many rural areas, "due to some shortcomings in the promotion of production increase measures in the past, some negative emotions have arisen, and they are hesitant to implement production increase measures. In this case, if we continue to criticize impatience and rashness, I am afraid it will not be of much benefit to the work?" In the newspaper, I have not seen that in this case, a lot of space is still being used to "continue to criticize impatience and rashness." If there are indeed still old impatient and rash phenomena in actual work, or new impatient and rash phenomena have appeared, then, as a reader, I believe that even in this case (in the case where many areas have shown hesitation), the newspaper should reflect the impatient and rash phenomena and criticize them. Under normal circumstances, doing so will be beneficial to the work. If some cadres are still using bureaucratic and subjectivist methods to forcibly promote some unrealistic "production increase measures," and the masses reflect the situation to the newspaper's editorial department, but the editorial department ignores it, I think this will be a mistake in the editorial department's work. Of course, these are all assumptions. Such a situation has not occurred yet. When there is no impatient and rash phenomenon in actual work, there is naturally no need to criticize impatience and rashness; however, if someone publishes an opinion in the newspaper saying that every specific error in impatience and rashness is unavoidable, then I think anyone should be allowed to express their opposition at any time.
	
There is also the question of whether criticism will dampen cadres' enthusiasm? Comrade Yi Nong also believes that the policy of "affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, and protecting cadres' enthusiasm" is very correct. However, he actually only acknowledges that affirming achievements can protect cadres' enthusiasm, and opposes criticizing shortcomings and protecting cadres' enthusiasm. In the second half of last year, for a period of time, I saw in the newspaper that some criticisms from the masses were indeed published regarding the promotion of agricultural production increase measures. I also heard that in some places, comrades who were doing agricultural technology promotion work and general cadres who were leading rural work were somewhat depressed during that period. The relationship between this emotional depression and the criticism in the newspapers and other aspects is probably still difficult to judge. However, it can be definitely said that: on the one hand, it is not entirely due to criticism; on the other hand, it is not completely unrelated to criticism. I think there were shortcomings in the newspaper's propaganda on this issue at that time. The shortcoming of the newspaper's propaganda at that time was not in criticizing the shortcomings in the work, nor in "excessive criticism and accusations," but in not doing enough in affirming achievements. In fact, judging from the actual situation, the criticism in the newspaper was not necessarily sufficient, let alone "excessive"; it only seemed relatively "excessive" during that period because not enough was done in affirming achievements during a certain period. Realistic criticism will never dampen the enthusiasm of cadres who are loyal to the interests of the people at any time, but will only help eliminate those negative factors that are unfavorable to the people. The enthusiasm of cadres must be protected; however, "protecting enthusiasm" must not be understood as "not criticizing even if they have done wrong things." If they have done wrong things, admitting mistakes, accepting criticism, and improving work can eliminate the negativity in cadres and greatly promote enthusiasm; this is even more beneficial to promoting the enthusiasm of the masses.

Since Mistakes Have Been Made, Criticism Should Be Allowed
	
Comrade Yi Nong's article "Response to Comrade Zhiyan's Opinions," published in the People's Daily on April 18th, provided some materials on the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" japonica rice and once again expressed his views on this matter. I think some of his views are still incorrect.
	
The joint inspection materials of the Ministry of Supervision, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Supervision and the Department of Agriculture (see People's Daily, October 12, 1956) stated that more than 3.01 million jin of "Aomori No. 5" seeds were promoted in Hunan, resulting in a total yield reduction of approximately 45 million jin. The masses had many opinions, saying: "We should not promote seeds that have not been tested on a large scale," "The seeds come from far away, with no grain and no 'management' (short stalks); no trial planting beforehand, harming people is really not shallow," "With so many seeds, small cadres don't have the guts to do so much, it must be done by big cadres." These opinions should be said to be correct and should be allowed to be expressed.
	
One of the tasks and purposes of rural work cadres is to guide farmers towards prosperity, and the vast majority of them have the same feelings as the farmers. If agricultural production suffers losses, it means that their work tasks have suffered losses, and they will be unhappy. If the work is not done well, resulting in reduced production, criticizing them can help them examine the root causes of the errors and avoid repeating them. They will not object to this; even if some of the farmers' criticisms are sharper, they will understand. Generally speaking, the vast majority of cadres have the spirit of "correcting mistakes if they have them, and being encouraged if they don't," and are not afraid of criticism. As for cadres who feel at ease and indifferent when they see their work fail and farmers suffer losses, and become passive when criticized, they are not the majority. "Aomori No. 5" was decided by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture for promotion, and the rural work cadres only had to carry out the order. If the result of the execution is a great loss, can they be satisfied with this decision of the superior and complain about the criticism of the masses of farmers?
	
It is not difficult for us to see that in the "Aomori No. 5" incident, there was a contradiction between the masses of farmers and the government, between the grassroots cadres and the superior leadership departments. Comrade Yi Nong does not seem to have noticed this; when he mentioned the "Aomori No. 5" incident in his "Learn from Last Year's Experience and Better Promote Agricultural Production Increase Measures" (see People's Daily, March 29), he said: "...it has also been subjected to excessive criticism and accusations, which has hurt the emotions of cadres and farmers." I have already said in "How Should We Look at the Aomori No. 5 Incident?" that this is a way of opposing criticism by putting a label of "hurting the emotions of cadres and farmers." What hurts the emotions of cadres and farmers is not criticism and accusations, but the blind promotion of "Aomori No. 5" itself. May I ask: the farmers plant according to orders, and the farmers are the ones who directly suffer the losses. Who else would criticize the farmers? How could criticism of this incident hurt the feelings of the farmers? As for the cadres, only those who hold the same attitude as Comrade Yi Nong may have their emotions hurt by criticism. Comrade Yi Nong said in this "opinion": "A person lives a lifetime, works a lifetime, often has achievements, and also makes mistakes. It is not permissible to have a forgiving attitude towards mistakes, let alone cover them up. At the same time, we should also strive to avoid excessive criticism and accusations." What is "excessive criticism and accusations"? What is the standard for "excessive"? How can people know exactly whether it is "excessive" when they make suggestions? Isn't this kind of request asking many people not to make suggestions, or not to "know everything and say everything, say everything without reservation" when making critical suggestions, but to reserve some of their opinions? This kind of argument that insists on not wanting people to make suggestions or to make fewer suggestions is not helpful for resolving the contradictions revealed in the "Aomori No. 5" incident. If people are not allowed to speak freely, it will not be possible to clarify the basis and reasons for criticism, and it will not be possible to completely correct the shortcomings and resolve the contradictions.
	
Although the failure of the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" is an example of the work of promoting improved varieties, it is not the same as the failures caused by limited scientific levels and compliance with national regulations. When discussing this issue, we should stick to the matter itself and not confuse it with other events. Otherwise, it will blur the essence of the "Aomori No. 5" incident, and it will make people see some truly inevitable failures as being the same as this incident. This is not at all beneficial to future agricultural technology reform.

### 怎样对待错误？怎样对待批评？  批评会不会伤害干部的积极性

专栏：

    怎样对待错误？怎样对待批评？
    编者按　本报3月29日发表了益农同志写的“吸取去年的经验更好地推行农业增产措施”一文，其中谈到去年在湖北、湖南推广“青森五号”粳稻中发生的错误。益农同志认为：这件事同别的许多事情的失败一样是“在新生事物中难以避免的”，“但是，也受到了过多的批评和指责，伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪。”这篇文章发表后，我们收到直言同志寄来的一篇文章，对益农同志文中谈到的这一点表示了不同的意见，以“怎样看待‘青森五号’事件呢”为题发表在4月14日第三版的“读报杂感”栏。益农同志又写了一篇“对直言同志意见的意见”，本报已在4月18日发表。直言同志和别的一些同志认为益农同志这篇“意见”仍有一些不正确的地方。现在我们把直言等同志的意见发表在这里。
    批评会不会伤害干部的积极性
      “……加上农村工作和农业工作领导干部水平也还不够高，还存在着主观主义和官僚主义。因之，在农业增产措施的推广中，遭受一点失败（也包括推广“青森五号”在内），是可以理解的，也是难以避免的。”——这是益农同志“对直言同志意见的意见”（见4月18日人民日报）中的两句话。不知道别的同志读了这两句话如何理解，我读了觉得实在难以理解。
    由于客观情况的复杂和干部经验的缺乏，在推行增产措施的工作中偶有错误，的确是难免的。可是，能够说每一项具体的错误都是难以避免的吗？把难以避免的原因说成是领导干部还有官僚主义和主观主义，这是不是说领导干部的官僚主义和主观主义也都是难以避免的呢？如果说领导干部的官僚主义和主观主义的确是难以避免的，那么，我们岂不是应该对这些官僚主义和主观主义加以原谅吗？对于官僚主义和主观主义，又岂可原谅？
    推广“青森五号”粳稻使湖南许多地方水稻减产，这一项具体的错误，显然并不是难以避免的错误。
    现在来谈这件事，主要的不是为了“青森五号”事件本身，更重要的是究竟应该“怎样对待缺点和错误”。益农同志的意见中有比较长的一段专谈了这个问题，我也认为这个问题值得提出来讨论。农业领导部门对“青森五号”已经表示了什么态度，是不是应该再作检查和讨论，可以另作别论。这里要谈的是益农同志对于“怎样对待缺点和错误”的一些看法。
    益农同志也认为“对于做坏了的事情和犯有错误的人，给予适当的批评是任何人也不应该反对的”；“犯了错误是不容许抱原谅态度，更不容许掩盖的”。可是，他紧接着又说：“同时，也应该力求避免过多的批评指责。”什么叫做“过多的批评指责”呢？这问题值得研究一下。对于推广“青森五号”造成的错误，是不是已经有了“过多的批评指责”呢？我只看到过去年10月12日人民日报上发表过农业部和监察部检查这个事件的报道，在人民日报同一天发表的社论中对“青森五号”事件也只是提了一下，也没有专就此事“过多指责”。在别的报纸上，也没有看到对这件事有“过多的批评和指责”。在湖南、湖北两省的农民群众当中，对这件事可能不断发出批评和指责，可是，能够教训为此受了损失的农民群众，说他们不该有“过多的批评和指责”吗？人民日报读者直言同志写了一则“读报杂感”，又谈到了“青森五号”事件，在人民日报上发表了。过去报上已经谈过了“青森五号”，时隔数月又来谈这件事，这似乎有点像是“过多的批评和指责”。可是，在直言同志写这个杂感之前，益农同志就已经宣称对去年推广“青森五号”的错误的批评“过多”了。实际上，直言同志批评的已经不是去年推广“青森五号”这件事，而是益农同志对待错误、对待批评的意见。
    还有一个批评的时机问题。我同意，批评应该选择一定的时机。因为批评的目的原是为了加强团结，为了改进工作，如果在某种情况下提出批评对工作和团结反而不利，那就应该等待一个适当的时机。可是，能不能说，在一般情况下，在实际工作中较多地出现了右倾保守的情况的时候，即使有出现了盲目冒进的情况也不必提出批评呢？那恐怕也不是实事求是的吧？我认为，报纸上过去的宣传正有这个毛病，反对“左”倾的时候满版都是反对“左”倾，即使实际工作中有了某些右的倾向也不加理睬。右的倾向发展成了优势，就又一味反对右倾，即使实际工作中仍有某些“左”的倾向也不指出。这样做，恐怕对工作也未必十分有利吧？益农同志说：目前在许多地区农村中，“由于过去在推广增产措施中有些缺点，产生了某些消极情绪，对贯彻增产措施缩手缩脚。在这种情况下，倘若继续批评急躁冒进，恐怕对工作没有多少好处吧？”在报纸上，我并没有看到在这种情况下仍然用很多篇幅“继续批评急躁冒进”。如果实际工作中的确仍然有旧的急躁冒进现象或者出现了新的急躁冒进现象，那末，作为一个读者，我认为即使在这种情况下（许多地区出现了缩手缩脚现象的情况下），报纸也应该把急躁冒进现象反映出来，加以批评。在一般情况下，这样做，会对工作有好处。如果现在有些干部仍然在用官僚主义、主观主义的作法强行推广某些不切实际的“增产措施”，群众把情况反映到报纸的编辑部，而编辑部却置之不理，我认为这将是编辑部工作上的一个错误。当然，这些都是假设。目前并没有发生这样的情形。在实际工作中没有急躁冒进的现象的时候，自然不必批评急躁冒进；可是，如果有人在报纸上发表意见说急躁冒进之中的每一项具体错误都是难以避免的，那末，我认为任何时候都应该允许别人表示反对。
    还有一个问题：批评会不会打击干部的积极性？益农同志也认为“肯定成绩，批评缺点，保护干部积极性”的方针是十分正确的。可是，他实际上只承认肯定成绩才能保护干部的积极性，而把批评缺点和保护干部积极性对立了起来。去年下半年，有一个时期，我在报纸上看到，对于推行农业增产措施，的确是发表了一些来自群众的批评意见。我也听到，在有些地方，做农业技术推广工作的同志和一般的领导农村工作的同志，在那个时期情绪有些消沉。这情绪的消沉和报纸上的以及其他方面的批评的关系究竟如何，恐怕还很难判断。不过可以肯定地说：一方面，不完全是由于批评；另方面与批评也不是完全无关。我认为当时报纸对这个问题的宣传是有缺点的。当时报纸上的宣传的缺点不在于批评了工作中的缺点，也不在于“过多的批评和指责”，而在于在肯定成绩方面做得不够。其实，从实际情况看来，报纸上的批评，也不见得就做得很够了，更不能说“过多”；只是因为有一个时期肯定成绩做得不够，就相对地显得那一个时期批评“过多”了。实事求是的批评，在任何时候也不会打击忠诚于人民利益的干部的积极性，而只会有利于消除不利于人民的那些消极因素。对干部的积极性是一定要保护的；可是，决不可把“保护积极性”理解为“做错了事也不批评”。做错了事，承认错误，接受批评，改进工作，正可以消除干部身上的消极性而大大发扬积极性；这对于发扬群众的积极性是更为有利的。　欧海滨
    既然犯了错误就该允许批评
    4月18日在人民日报发表的益农同志写的“对直言同志意见的意见”一文，提供了一些推广“青森五号”粳稻的材料，再一次表示了他对这件事情的看法。我认为他的看法仍然有一些是不正确的。
    监察部、农业部和湖南省监察厅、农业厅的联合检查材料（见1956年10月12日人民日报）中说，在湖南推广“青森五号”三百零一万多斤种子，共约减产四千五百万斤。群众意见很大，他们说：“不应该大面积推广没有经过试种的种子”，“种子来的远，无谷又无管（禾秆短小）；事先没试种，害人真不浅。”“搞这样多的种子，小干部没有那么大的胆量，一定是大干部搞的。”这些意见，应该说是正确的，应该让他们说出来。
    农村工作干部的工作任务和目的之一是引导农民走向富裕，他们绝大多数和农民有相同的感情。农业生产受了损失，也就是他们的工作任务受了损失，他们就会不高兴。工作没做好，以致减产了，批评他们，可以帮助他们检查错误的根源，避免再犯，他们是不会反对的；即使农民的某些批评尖刻了一些，他们也会理解的。一般说来，广大干部对待批评都有“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神，并不害怕批评。至于看到自己工作失败、农民受到损失，仍心安理得，无动于衷，受到批评就消极起来的干部，并不是多数。“青森五号”是省农业厅决定，农业部批准推广的，农村工作干部只有奉令执行。执行的结果损失很大，他们能满意上级这种决定而抱怨农民群众的批评吗？
    我们不难看出，在“青森五号”事件中，表现出了农民群众和政府、基层干部和上级领导部门之间的矛盾。益农同志似乎没有注意这些；在他写的“吸取去年的经验，更好地推行农业增产措施”（见3月29日人民日报）中涉及“青森五号”事件的时候说：“……也受到了过多的批评和指责，伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪。”我在“怎样看待青森五号事件呢？”一文中已经说过：这是用扣“伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪”的帽子的办法反对批评的论调。伤害干部和农民情绪的，并不是什么批评和指责，而是盲目推广“青森五号”这件事本身。请问：农民奉令种植，直接受损失的是农民，谁还去批评农民？对这件事的批评又怎么会伤害农民的情绪呢？至于干部，也只有同益农同志抱同样态度的人，才有可能被批评伤害了情绪。益农同志在这次“意见”里说：“一个人生活一辈子，做一辈子工作，经常有成绩，也犯错误，犯了错误是不容许抱原谅态度，更不容许掩盖的。同时，也应该力求避免过多的批评指责”。什么叫“过多的批评指责”？“过多”的尺度是什么？人们提意见的时候又怎么能十分确切地知道是不是“过多”的？这种要求岂不是让很多人不要提出意见，或者提出批评意见的时候不要“知无不言，言无不尽”，而要保留一部分意见吗？这种坚持不想让人家提意见或少提点意见的反对批评的论调，对“青森五号”事件中表现出来的矛盾的解决是没有好处的。不让人们畅所欲言，就不可能把批评的根据和原因弄清楚，也就不可能彻底改正缺点，解决矛盾。
    推广“青森五号”的失败，虽是推广良种工作中的一个事例，但是它和限于科学水平、遵守国家规定的情况下造成的失败并不相同。讨论这个问题的时候，应该就事论事，不应该和其他事件混为一谈。不然，就会模糊“青森五号”事件的实质，就会使人把一些真正难免的失败看成和这一事件一样。这对今后的农业技术改革是没有丝毫好处的。
                        直言
