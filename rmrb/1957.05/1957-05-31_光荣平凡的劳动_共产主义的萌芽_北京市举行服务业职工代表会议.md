Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: A Beijing Service Industry Employee Representative Meeting opened today.

The more than nine hundred and seventy representatives attending this meeting were all outstanding service personnel elected from various service industries. Among them were chefs, bathhouse workers, bus and trolley ticket sellers who work all day squeezed in crowds, barbers who stand and work for ten hours with their hands constantly moving, park service personnel who are doubly busy when others are resting, and shop assistants, etc.

This is the first time such a meeting has been held in Beijing. It is jointly convened by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report at the meeting today (see page 4 today). He expressed his cordial greetings and high respect to the employees engaged in social service undertakings for their glorious and effective labor. He cited many examples to illustrate that service industry employees love their work and love labor, which is worthy of praise and worthy of everyone's learning. He said with enthusiasm that this labor may seem ordinary, but it is impossible to imagine that without these ordinary labors, the people of the capital could live so happily and work so smoothly.

Wang Jiong said that at present, the service industry still has shortcomings such as poor service quality and waste. He encouraged service industry employees to treat their work more diligently and serve the people better.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the meeting today to congratulate them. He told the representatives that the ultimate goal of our socialist production is to meet the needs of the people, and you are directly serving the people, so your labor is as important and as glorious as the labor of other working people. In the old society, service work was discriminated against. This feudal concept still lingers among many people today. Some people think that as long as they pay, others have to serve them. From these people, we see the remnants of the ugly thoughts of the old society.

Lai Ruoyu said that the great Lenin highly valued the service industry, and he regarded the nurseries and canteens that were established after the revolution to serve the working people as the buds of communism.

Lai Ruoyu said that we must educate those who discriminate against and disrespect the service industry and correct their erroneous views. And the workers in the service industry themselves should first value their own work, strive to improve the quality of service, and use excellent results to attract social attention.

Wang Ziru, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, and Zhou Shixian, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke at the meeting today.

### 光荣平凡的劳动　共产主义的萌芽  北京市举行服务业职工代表会议

    光荣平凡的劳动　共产主义的萌芽
    北京市举行服务业职工代表会议
    据新华社30日讯　北京市服务业职工代表会议今天开幕。
    出席这个会议的九百七十多个代表，都是各个服务业推选出来的优秀服务人员。他们中间有厨师，浴池工人，成天挤在上上下下的人丛中工作的公共汽车、电车售票员，双手不停地站着工作十小时的理发员，别人休息而他们加倍忙碌的公园服务员和商店售货员等。
    这样的会议在北京还是第一次召开。它是北京市工会联合会、北京市民主妇女联合会和共青团北京市委员会联合召开的。
    北京市工会联合会主席王炯今天在会上作了报告（见今天第四版）。他对从事社会服务事业的职工们的光荣的有成效的劳动表示亲切的慰问和致崇高的敬意。他列举许多事例说明服务业职工热爱工作，热爱劳动，值得表扬，值得大家学习。他热情地说，这些劳动看起来都是平凡的，但是不能设想没有这些平凡的劳动，首都人民能够生活得这样幸福和工作得这样顺利。
    王炯说，目前服务业还存在服务质量不高，有浪费现象的缺点，他勉励服务业职工更进一步地勤勤恳恳地对待自己的工作，更好地为人民服务。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚今天到会祝贺。他向代表们说，我们社会主义生产的终极目的是为了满足人民的需要，而你们是直接为人民服务的，所以你们的劳动和其他劳动人民的劳动同样重要，同样光荣。在旧社会里，服务性劳动被人歧视。这种封建观念直到今天还残存在不少人中间。有些人以为，只要自己拿钱，别人就得服侍他。从这些人身上我们看到了旧社会的丑恶思想的残余。
    赖若愚说，伟大的列宁非常看重服务性行业，他把革命以后兴办起来的为劳动人民服务的托儿所、食堂看作是共产主义的萌芽。
    赖若愚说，我们要教育那些歧视和不尊重服务性行业的人，纠正他们这种错误的观点。而服务性行业的工作者自己，应该首先重视自己的工作，努力改进服务质量，用优秀的成绩引起社会的重视。
    北京市民主妇女联合会副主席王子如、共青团北京市委员会副书记周士贤今天也在会上讲了话。
