    Learning to Reason
  　Yi Qin
    Recently, some comrades in municipal and county Party committees, when discussing issues related to contradictions among the people, while admitting that contradictions among the people must be resolved through persuasion and education, always felt that truly persuading the masses required senior leaders, and they themselves found it difficult. The reason is: senior leaders have high prestige, their words carry weight, and the masses are more likely to accept them; leaders of lower-level units have less prestige, lower levels of understanding, and the masses are less likely to listen to them. Therefore, the method of persuasion and education is not easy to implement.

    Of course, under normal circumstances, the words of senior leaders are more likely to convince the masses than the words of lower-level leaders. However, this is primarily not because they are superior leaders, but because their words can convince people with reason and genuinely resolve the ideological problems of the masses. The reason why the words of some lower-level leaders fail to convince the masses is not because their positions are lower, but because: when problems arise among the masses, especially when the masses have grievances against the leadership, they do not deeply understand the problems of the masses and patiently resolve them, but instead adopt coercive orders or crude methods of "suppression." Instead of resolving the problems, they want to "suppress" people, how can they be convinced?

    Therefore, the issue is not about the level of position. If a senior leader adopts a method of suppression when dealing with problems among the masses, even if his position is higher, the masses will still not be convinced. If leaders of lower-level units truly integrate with the masses, use persuasion, and promptly resolve the ideological problems of the masses, even if their positions are lower, the masses will still be convinced. Many Party branch secretaries in agricultural cooperatives and Party propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises are not senior leaders, but they do a very good job in persuading and educating the masses, which is a very clear example.

    It should also be admitted that persuasion and education is indeed a new working method for some leaders of lower-level units, not only because they lack experience and have a lower level of understanding, but also because although they have known this method for a long time, they have not used it correctly. Their so-called persuasion and education is often a method of "soft suppression," not truly reasoning with the masses to achieve genuine conviction. Therefore, when they are now asked to truly use the method of reasoning to deal with the masses, they feel somewhat embarrassed. However, there is nothing to be afraid of. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it," the method of reasoning can be learned. We should all be determined to learn this method.

    学会说道理
  　宜勤
    最近，有些市、县委的同志在讨论有关人民内部矛盾问题的时候，虽然承认人民内部的矛盾必须用说服教育的办法去解决；但总觉得要真正说服群众，非靠高级领导干部不可，自己就很困难了。理由是：高级领导干部威信高，说话算话，群众容易接受；下级单位的领导同志威信不高，水平低，说起话来群众不大听得进去。因此，说服教育的办法不容易行得通。
    当然，在一般情况下，高级领导同志说的话会比下级领导同志说的话容易使群众心悦诚服。但是，这首先不是因为他是上级领导同志，而是因为他的话能够以理服人，能够真正解决群众的思想问题。某些下级领导同志说的话所以不能使群众信服，也不是因为他们的职位低了，而是因为：当群众中发生了问题，特别是当群众对领导方面有不满情绪的时候，他们不是深入了解群众中的问题，耐心地去解决这些问题，而是采取强迫命令或者是粗暴的“压服”的办法。不仅不给解决问题，反而要去“压服”人家，这怎能叫人信服呢？
    所以，问题不在于职位的高低。如果某一个高级领导同志对群众中的问题采取压服的办法，那怕他的职位再高些，群众还是不会信服的。下级单位的领导同志，如果真正和群众打成一片，运用说服的办法，及时解决群众的思想问题，那怕他的职位再低些，群众还是会信服的。许多农业合作社的党支部书记、工矿企业里党的宣传员，他们都不是高级领导干部，但是对群众的说服教育工作，却做得很好，这就是很显明的例证。
    也应当承认，说服教育对于某些下级单位的领导同志说来，确实是一个新的工作方法，这不仅仅因为他们的经验不多，水平不高，而且因为他们虽然老早就知道了这种方法，但是并没有正确地运用它。他们的所谓说服教育，常常是一种“软压”的办法，并不是真正同群众讲道理，使群众口服心服。所以，现在要他们真正运用说理的方法同群众打交道的时候，他们就有些为难了。不过，这没有什么可怕。俗语说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，说道理的方法，是可以学会的。我们都应当下定决心，学会这种方法。
