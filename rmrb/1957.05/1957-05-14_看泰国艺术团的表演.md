    Watching the Performance of the Thai Art Troupe
        Mei Lanfang
    As early as six or seven hundred years ago, during our Yuan Dynasty, China and Thailand already had exchanges. By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, envoys were even more frequent, exchanging goods. The Siamese rice that everyone is most familiar with was already being transported to China at that time, and we also transported a large amount of copper to Siam. This shows that close economic relations had already developed between the two countries.
    Recently, the Thai Art Troupe came to China for a visit and performance, which is a new beginning for cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries. I was excited to see their many comprehensive performances. Below, I will briefly introduce their five types of content: dance, song, music, mime, and dance drama:
    In the dances, "Blessing" and "Long Nail Dance" both have slow movements, clear rhythms, and sway like a wandering silk thread. Sometimes when their feet touch the ground, the heel, toes, and sole of the foot must be divided into several rhythms to complete this action, giving people the feeling of being in the middle of the water. The gestures of the "Long Nail Dance" are also very beautiful.
    In the songs, there is a Chinese song "The Sun Rises on the Grassland." When the performer Suthep sings "The people here love peace and also love their hometown," it contains the common aspirations of the people of Asian countries, so we feel particularly close. After listening to the final grand chorus "China and Thailand are One Family," the audience erupted in thunderous applause to welcome the guests from the neighboring country, whose performances were also full of a spirit of peace and deep friendship.
   "Singing a Love Spell Under the Moonlight" is about a goddess who is weaving a sacred robe when she is bewitched by an evil god. Even as an audience member who doesn't understand Thai, I can still understand the whole story from the songs of the two actors, Pinsy and Suthep: the goddess, under the moonlight, originally had a pure heart, but gradually developed worldly thoughts and eventually destroyed the sacred robe.
    In the music, the "Angklung" is a bamboo instrument played by five people. Each person holds two "Angklungs," and each "Angklung" makes a sound when shaken. In other words, each person has two notes in their hands. When five people combine together, they can play any piece of music, and the tunes are harmonious and melodious. We saw such a fresh and unique instrument for the first time. I especially appreciate Bunrong's performance of "Bamboo Qin Solo," the melody is fluent and beautiful, like the warbling of orioles in the trees, or the chirping of springs at the bottom of the ravine. He has amazing skill in his wrists. The playing of this instrument is similar to the technique of drumming. The old musicians in our Peking Opera circle often said to me, "The most skillful way to play the tanggu drum is with the back of the hand facing up." He plays it in that way.
    Mime: "Sukrip Uproots the Tree" is said to be a drama from the court of King Zheng of Thailand. This is a section from India's oldest epic, "Ramayana." "Ramayana" has the same value as Homer's epic poems in Greece and occupies an important place in world literary history. This story describes Rama's monkey general Sukrip fighting the demon king's brother. The enemy could not defeat him, so he tricked him into uprooting a tree. After uprooting the tree, the monkey general was exhausted and naturally could not defeat the enemy. He was later rescued by the divine monkey Hanuman and was able to escape. In terms of performance, the monkey general did not uproot the tree on the spot, but when he came out carrying a tree, his dance movements were so realistic that they showed his exhaustion, making it clear at a glance that he had just uprooted the tree.
    The dance drama "Lakhon" is a story about a princess choosing a husband. In this play, the dance involves only two characters slowly moving on stage. The inner emotions of both sides are expressed entirely through their footsteps and facial expressions. Supan, who plays the princess, has a dignified and beautiful pace, coupled with affectionate expressions, which is very suitable for the identity of the character.
    After watching, I felt that there were many good things worth learning from them. I am even more grateful to the Thai Art Troupe for coming to China from afar and giving us so many wonderful performances!

    看泰国艺术团的表演
        梅兰芳
    远在六七百年以前，当我们元朝时代，中国和泰国就有了往来，到了明清两朝，更是使节频繁，互通有无。大家最熟悉的暹罗米，在那时已经运来中国，我们也运送过大量的铜到暹罗去，这说明两国间在经济方面早就发生了密切关系。
    最近泰国艺术团来到中国作访问演出，这对两国人民的文化交流是一个新的开端。我兴奋地看到了他们许多的综合性的表演，下面我把他们的舞蹈、歌唱、音乐、哑剧、舞剧五种内容，简单地介绍一下：
    舞蹈里面，“祝福”、“长甲舞”都是动作纡徐，节奏鲜明，摇漾地好像一条游丝似的。有时候她们的脚落一下地，脚跟、脚趾、脚掌要分成几个节奏才完成这一动作，使人看了有人在水中央的感觉。 “长甲舞”的手势也很美妙。
    歌唱里面，有支中国曲子“草原上升起不落的太阳”，当表演者素贴唱到“这里的人们爱和平，也热爱家乡”时，蕴藏着亚洲各国人民的共同愿望，所以我们觉得格外亲热。最后听完了一支大合唱“中泰一家亲”，全场观众掀起了如雷般的掌声，来表示欢迎邻国客人在表演节目中还充满了爱好和平的精神和浓厚的友谊。
   “月光下唱着爱情的咒歌”，是写一个神女正在纺织一件神圣袈裟时，被一个邪神所迷惑的故事。像我这样一个不懂泰国语言的观众，只从这两位演员翩西、素贴的歌声里，一样能了解这个故事的始末是：神女在月夜中，本来是一尘不染的心情，渐渐动了凡心，终于毁灭了神圣的袈裟。
    音乐里面，“安卡伦”是一种竹制的乐器，由五个人拿着进行演奏，每人手拿两支“安卡伦”，每支“安卡伦”摇动起来，就会发出一个音，换句话说就是每人的手上掌握着两个音，五个人连合一起，可以演奏任何的乐曲，而且奏出来的曲子都协调悦耳。像这样新鲜、别致的乐器，我们还是第一次见着。我尤其欣赏汶荣表演的“竹琴独奏”，曲调流利动听，像是树上的莺语，又像是涧底的鸣泉。他手腕上有惊人的功夫，这种乐器的演奏，和击鼓的手法差不多，我们京剧界的音乐家老前辈们常对我说：“打堂鼓最见功夫的打法是手背朝上。”他就是这样的打法。
    哑剧：“苏克里浦拔树”，据说是泰国郑王时代宫廷中的戏剧，这是印度最古的史诗“罗摩衍那”里的一段。“罗摩衍那”和希腊的荷马史诗有同等的价值，在世界文学史上都占着重要的地位。这故事是描写罗摩的猴将苏克里浦和魔王的弟弟作战，敌人打他不过，骗他去拔树，刚拔完树的猴将精力疲乏，自然就打不过敌人，后经神猴诃努曼营救，才得脱身。在表演方面，猴将并没有当场拔树，但当他扛着一棵树出场以后，由于舞蹈动作的逼真，表现出疲劳过度的神气，使人一望而知这棵树是他刚刚拔出来的。
    舞剧“洛坤”是一个公主选婿的故事。这出戏的舞蹈，只是两个角色在台上慢慢地走动，双方的内心情感，全靠在脚步和面部上表达出来。扮演公主的素攀，她那种庄严而美丽的步伐，配上含情脉脉的妙相，非常适合剧中人的身份。
    看完以后，我感到有不少的好东西是值得我们学习的。我更感谢泰国艺术团这次远道来华为我们作出许多的精彩表演！
