Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 12th: German Democratic Republic First Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht delivered a speech on the current German situation at a voters' meeting attended by five thousand people in Leipzig on the evening of May 10th. He also answered questions raised by voters at the meeting.

He pointed out that turning West Germany into a base for atomic warfare would not constitute an effective threat; in reality, it would turn West Germany itself into a volcano. Ulbricht said: The West German government is implementing an atomic armament policy because "it fears the working people in its own country." He further said: "What the Adenauer government fears most is the peaceful reunification of Germany through an understanding between the two Germanys. Such a unification means the subjugation of militarism."

Referring to the statements by the West German Social Democratic Party and trade unions against atomic armament, Ulbricht said: "This is absolutely correct." He then pointed out that it is regrettable that the Social Democratic leadership is currently only concerned with how to enter a coalition government and is not yet prepared to support an organized people's movement.

Ulbricht also spoke at the voters' meeting about the June 23rd elections in the German Democratic Republic, increasing industrial and agricultural production, and gradually improving the people's living standards.

The voters' meeting unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the decision of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic to propose a joint candidate list of all parties.

    乌布利希在选民大会上说
    原子武装把西德变成火山
    阿登纳政府害怕德国的和平统一
    据新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希5月10日晚上在来比锡一个有五千人参加的选民大会上发表了有关当前的德国局势问题的讲话。他还在大会上回答了选民所提出的问题。
    他指出：把西德变成原子战争基地的做法并不会构成有效的威胁，实际上倒是把西德自己变成了一座火山。乌布利希说：西德政府之所以实行原子武装政策是因为“它害怕自己国内的劳动人民”。他又说： “阿登纳政府最害怕的是通过两个德国之间达成谅解的道路实现德国的和平统一。这样的统一意味着军国主义的被压服”。
    在谈到西德社会民主党和工会反对进行原子武装的声明时，乌布利希说：“这是完全正确的”。他接着指出遗憾的是社会民主党的领导目前只关心怎样进入联合政府，而还没有准备支持一个有组织的人民运动。
    乌布利希在选民大会上还谈到了民主德国6月23日的选举、提高工农业生产和逐步提高人民生活水平等问题。
    选民大会一致通过了一项决议，拥护民主德国全国阵线将提出各党派联合候选人名单的决议。
