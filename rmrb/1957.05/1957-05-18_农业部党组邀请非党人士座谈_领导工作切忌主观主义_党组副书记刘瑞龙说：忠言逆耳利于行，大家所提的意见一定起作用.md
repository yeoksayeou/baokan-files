The Ministry of Agriculture Party Group Invites Non-Party Figures to a Forum
    Subjectivism Should Be Avoided in Leadership Work
    Party Group Deputy Secretary Liu Ruilong Said: Honest Advice, Though Unpleasant to the Ear, Benefits Action; The Opinions Offered by Everyone Will Certainly Have an Effect.

    (Our Newspaper) The Party Group of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Chinese Communist Party invited more than twenty people from various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures within the ministry to hold a forum on the afternoon of the 17th. Those who spoke at the meeting included Zeng Xianpu, director of the Agricultural and Industrial Democratic Party's general branch in the Ministry of Agriculture, non-party democratic figure Mo Dingsen, Chen Ren of the Jiu San Society branch committee, and Liu Guofang, Chen Jiaxiang, Ruan Molin, and Xu Jiwu from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang branch committee and its members. They focused on criticizing the subjectivism and sectarianism of the Ministry of Agriculture's leadership. Party Group Deputy Secretary Liu Ruilong expressed sincere acceptance of the criticisms and promised to immediately correct the shortcomings.

    Mo Dingsen said:
    The Leadership Does Not Accept My Opinion
    Years of Neglecting Grain Production Development

    Mo Dingsen criticized the Ministry of Agriculture's leaders for failing to correctly arrange the planting area for food crops and cash crops and neglecting the development of grain production in recent years. He said that in 1951, the leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture said that there was too much grain and that cotton should be developed. Wang Shou, director of the Grain Production Bureau, and I believed that this was a temporary phenomenon during the period when the national land reform had just ended and that our country did not truly have enough grain. We did not agree with this approach. Our opinions were raised at the ministry affairs meetings, and we especially opposed the large-scale development of cotton in the Southwest region. The responsible directors and office directors did not agree with our opinions. As a result, cotton was planted on a large scale in 1952, and a grain shortage occurred in 1953. Later, during the general line study, we raised this issue again, but it did not attract the attention of the leadership. It is said that Zhejiang Province, which has always been short of grain, was able to become self-sufficient last year. However, they only averaged over 450 jin per person, and very few reached 500 jin. In 1947, Zhejiang Province averaged 507 jin per person, which is clearly still less than in the past. Wuhu, Anhui, known as the land of fish and rice, only averaged 480 jin of grain per person last year. This shows that developing grain production is very important.

    In 1947, China's cotton cultivation area was more than 30 million mu, and by last year, it had expanded to more than 93 million mu, with production increasing by about two times. As far as I know, in Poland, it increased by 49% compared to before the war. Other countries such as France, Italy, and West Germany only increased by 11%-43%. Therefore, whether we need that much cotton is still a question.

    This year, the Central Committee proposed prioritizing the development of grain production while simultaneously developing diversified operations. I strongly support this policy. However, as far as I know, Guangdong's grain area has decreased by 2 million mu this year, Guangxi has decreased by about 2 million mu, Zhejiang has decreased by 1.5 million mu, and Hunan has decreased by 800,000 mu. This shows that this policy is still just lip service because agricultural cooperatives produce according to their own needs.

    Mo Dingsen also criticized the practice of mechanically copying advanced Soviet experiences. He said that in the Second Five-Year Plan, the production ratio of chemical fertilizer raw materials phosphorus and nitrogen was one to one, which was copied from the Soviet experience. However, the Soviet Union has black soil rich in organic matter and nitrogen. Based on the actual situation of each mu producing 500 jin of rice and the nutrients absorbed from the soil, the ratio is three parts nitrogen to one part phosphorus. Therefore, following the standard of one part nitrogen to one part phosphorus does not conform to China's specific situation.

    When talking about the connection between departments within the Ministry, Mo Dingsen said: Last year, when promoting "Aomori No. 5," japonica rice, and Yin Fang rice, we in charge of grain production didn't know how much seed was transferred by the Seed Bureau. When problems arose, we sent people to inspect the work of the provinces. As a result, the provinces had a lot of opinions: "Is the bureaucracy in the Ministry of Agriculture or in our agricultural departments?" If the Seed Bureau had contacted our Rice Cultivation Department, it would have been better.

    He also mentioned that during the "Three-Anti" campaign, he was listed as a target of struggle in Zhejiang, and later it was announced that his case was a pending case. This case has not been resolved to this day, and he hopes that the Ministry of Agriculture will find a way to resolve it and draw a conclusion.

    Zeng Xianpu said:
    What Exactly Does the Ministry of Agriculture Do?
    How Can We Contend Without Creating Conditions?

    Zeng Xianpu stated in his speech that the working tasks of the Ministry of Agriculture have never been clearly defined. In the past, it seemed that the main focus was on launching production campaigns. Later, it was about grasping technical measures. After that, it became about economic work, such as prices and procurement. Last year, it was about exchanging experiences and organizing visits. What exactly will be done in the future? If this question is not clear, it will be difficult to solve the problem of using cadres.

    When talking about the shortcomings in the Ministry of Agriculture's cadre training work, he said that the contradiction between older cadres and younger cadres in the Ministry of Agriculture is the most prominent. The Party gives more encouragement, talks more, and contacts more with younger cadres, while the opposite is true for older cadres. Therefore, there is a gap between older and younger cadres. In the future, attention should be paid to how to use older cadres and leverage their strengths.

    Many internal Party documents are about professional work. For example, the Party member director once showed me internal Party materials about sericulture. However, such work-related materials are rarely seen. This practice prevents us from working well.

    Zeng Xianpu said that apart from a few conversations with individual ministers, the other ministers rarely made contact. They rarely talked about everyday matters with me.

    When talking about the Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Zeng Xianpu criticized the leadership for not creating conditions for experts within the ministry to contend. He said that there is a well-known horticultural expert in the ministry, but he has not been placed in a horticultural position, so he is naturally unable to contend.

    Finally, he criticized some Party members for their incorrect views on rectification. Some Party members believe that as long as everyone is willing to talk and offer opinions, there will be no problems. In fact, it is not so easy to overcome the three major isms. Party member cadres should have the spirit of visiting thatched cottages three times, listening to the opinions of non-Party comrades. Various forms should be adopted to allow people to speak freely. Arranging such long tables today makes it seem a bit serious. He also said: Not everyone has eliminated their concerns yet. Some people are still afraid of whether the sounds of contention will be pleasant, whether it will have side effects. All of this should be taken into consideration.

    Several other speakers offered criticisms and suggestions on streamlining the Ministry of Agriculture and leading production. Chen Ren said that in the past, the Ministry of Agriculture imposed overly rigid regulations on technical reforms in various regions, without emphasizing adapting to local conditions and timing. Now, while emphasizing adapting to local conditions, they have abandoned leadership over the specific directions that should be guided. Xu Jiwu, originally an engineer working on grain grading and inspection, very much wanted to develop a practical grain grading standard. However, when the personnel department of the Ministry of Agriculture arranged his work, they did not consider his strengths, so his wish could not be realized.

    Liu Ruilong said:
    Mo Dingsen's Grievance Will Be Resolved Immediately, and an Apology Will Be Extended to Him.

    Finally, Liu Ruilong, Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, stated that everyone's opinions are beneficial to rectification and improving work. Meetings like this will be held several more times in the future. He said: Whether the "sounds" of contention are pleasant or not doesn't matter. This time, we don't require it to be pleasant to the ear. Honest advice, though unpleasant to the ear, benefits action. We must listen to unpleasant words. He said that everyone's opinions will definitely have an effect and will not have side effects. Regarding the grievance mentioned by Mo Dingsen, he stated that it would be resolved immediately and extended an apology to Comrade Mo Dingsen.

### 农业部党组邀请非党人士座谈  领导工作切忌主观主义  党组副书记刘瑞龙说：忠言逆耳利于行，大家所提的意见一定起作用

    农业部党组邀请非党人士座谈
    领导工作切忌主观主义
    党组副书记刘瑞龙说：忠言逆耳利于行，大家所提的意见一定起作用
    本报讯　中共农业部党组在17日下午约请部内各民主党派和无党派民主人士二十余人举行座谈会。先后在会上发言的有农工民主党农业部总支主任委员曾宪朴，无党派民主人士莫定森，九三学社支委陈仁，中国国民党革命委员会支委及其成员刘国芳、陈家祥、软墨林、徐季吾等。他们着重批评了农业部领导上的主观主义和宗派主义情绪。党组副书记刘瑞龙在会上表示诚恳接受批评并立即改正缺点。莫定森说：
    领导上不接受我的意见
    多年忽视发展粮食生产
    莫定森对农业部领导人几年来未能正确安排粮食和经济作物的种植面积、忽视发展粮食生产提出批评。他说，在1951年，农业部的领导人就说粮食多了，要发展棉花。我和粮食生产局王绶局长认为，这是全国土地改革刚结束时期的暂时现象，并不是我国粮食真正已经够了。我们不同意这样做。我们的意见曾在部务会议上提出来，我们特别反对在西南地区大量发展棉花。主管的司和办公厅负责人都不同意我们的意见。于是，1952年棉花便大量种植起来，1953年就出现了粮食紧张的局面。后来，在总路线学习中，我们又提出这个问题，也没有引起领导上的注意。据说，一向缺粮的浙江省去年已能自给了。但他们每人平均四百五十多斤，达到五百斤的很少；而1947年，浙江省平均每人是五百零七斤，显然现在仍然比过去少。向称鱼米之乡的安徽芜湖，去年每人平均才四百八十斤粮。足见发展粮食生产是很重要的。
    我国的棉花，1947年是三千多万亩，到了去年，则已经发展到九千三百多万亩，产量约增加了两倍。据我了解，在波兰，比大战前增加49％。其他像法国、意大利、西德等，也不过增加11％—43％。因此，我们是不是需要那么多棉花还是问题。
    今年，中央提出优先发展粮食生产同时发展多种经营。我非常拥护这个方针。但是，据我了解，广东今年粮食面积减少二百万亩，广西减少了约二百万亩，浙江减少了一百五十万亩，湖南减少了八十万亩。可见，这个方针还停留在口头上。因为农业社是按照他们自己的需要生产。
    莫定森还批评了在学习苏联先进经验中的生搬硬套的作法。他说，第二个五年计划中，化学肥料原料磷和氮的生产是一比一，这就是搬的苏联经验。殊不知苏联是黑钙土，有机质丰富，氮素多。但是，根据每亩实产五百斤的水稻从土壤中吸取的情况看，则是氮三磷一。所以，要是按照氮一磷一的标准，是不符合中国具体情况的。
    莫定森在谈到部内部门与部门之间的联系的时候说：去年推广“青森五号”、粳稻和银坊稻，在种子处调了多少种子，我们管粮食生产的都不知道。到出了问题，我们却派人出去检查省的工作。这样，省里很有意见：“到底官僚主义在农业部还是在我们农业厅？”要是种子处和我们稻作处联系一下就好了。
    他还提出“三反”时，他在浙江被列为斗争对象，后来宣布他的问题是悬案。这个案迄今未解决，希望农业部设法解决，作出结论。曾宪朴说：
    农业部到底是干什么的？
    不给创造条件怎样争鸣？
    曾宪朴在发言中认为：农业部的工作任务到底是什么，始终是不明确的。过去一个时期好像主要是搞生产运动；后来又抓技术措施；后来又要搞经济工作中的价格、收购等问题；去年又在搞交流经验、组织参观之类。今后到底搞什么？这问题不清楚，对于使用干部问题也是难解决的。
    谈到农业部培养干部工作上的缺点的时候，他说，农业部老年干部和青年干部之间的矛盾最突出。党对青年干部鼓励多，谈得多，接触得多，而对老年干部则相反。因此，老年和青年干部有隔阂。今后需要注意怎样使用年纪大的干部，发挥他们的长处。
    党内文件许多都是关于业务工作的，例如党员局长曾经把党内蚕桑方面的材料给我看；但这种与工作有关的材料很少看到。这种做法使我们不能很好地工作。
    曾宪朴说，除了同个别部长曾经有过几次谈话以外，其他几位部长很少接触。他们很少同我谈家常。
    曾宪朴在谈到百家争鸣的时候，批评领导上没有给部内的专家创造争鸣的条件。他说，部里有一位国内知名的园艺专家，但并没有把他摆在园艺工作岗位上，他当然无法争鸣。
    他在最后批评了一些党员对整风的不正确看法。有些党员认为：只要大家肯谈，肯提意见，就没有什么问题了。其实，要反掉三大主义并不那么容易。党员干部应当要有三顾草庐的精神，倾听非党同志的意见。要采取多种多样的形式，让人随便谈。今天这样长桌子一摆，弄得有些严重。他还说：现在并不是所有人都已消除顾虑，还有人怕鸣了是不是悦耳，会不会起副作用，这都应当注意。
    其他几位发言人从农业部精简工作、对生产领导等方面提出批评和建议。陈仁说，农业部过去在技术改革中，给各地规定过死，没有强调因时因地制宜；现在，强调了因地制宜，但对于应具体领导的方向又放弃了领导。徐季吾原是作粮食分级检验工作的工程师，他很想搞出一个切合实际的粮食分级标准，但是，农业部人事部门在安排他的工作时，没有考虑他的所长，使他的愿望一直无法实现。刘瑞龙说：
    莫定森的冤屈马上就解决并向他表示歉意
    最后，农业部党组副书记刘瑞龙表示：大家所提意见对整风对改进工作都有好处，像这样的会今后还要开上若干次。他说：至于“鸣”是不是悦耳可以不管，这次不要求顺耳，忠言逆耳利于行，不好听的话也要听。他说大家所提意见一定能起作用，不会起副作用。对莫定森所说的冤屈，他表示马上就解决，并向莫定森同志表示歉意。
