    Can't Buy a Newspaper
    These days, the newspapers are full of "blooming" and "contending," and everyone is very concerned. Some people are excited to see that others are "contending" in the newspapers with things they have kept in their hearts for a long time. Those of us here who usually like to read the newspaper are now even more engrossed in it; those who usually don't read the newspaper much are now grabbing newspapers everywhere to read; some people who didn't subscribe to the newspaper in the past are now subscribing; some who originally participated in collective newspaper subscriptions are now subscribing individually, taking them home at night to slowly savor.
    But now there is a problem: the post office has very few newspapers for retail sale, and I often can't buy one anywhere. Originally, it was very convenient to buy newspapers at the cooperative, but I don't know why they don't sell them anymore.

    买不到报
    这几天，报上天天都在大“放”大“鸣”，大家都很关心。有的人看到人家在报上把自己憋在心里很久的话都“鸣”出来了，感到很兴奋。我们这里平时爱看报的，现在看得更入迷了；平时不大看报的人，现在也到处抓报看；过去没订报的人，有的现在也订报了；有的原来参加集体订报的，现在也单独订了报，晚上带回家去慢慢咀嚼。
    可是现在有个问题，邮局的零售报很少，我常常到处买不到。原来合作社也卖报倒很方便，不知为什么现在也不卖了。
