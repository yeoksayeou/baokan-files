Why Has "Among Comrades" Been Delayed?
        Xinhua News Agency Reporter Sun Shikai
   "Chen Qitong's new play 'Among Comrades' has been in internal review and observation performances for a long time, but it still hasn't been shown to the general public. It is said that it is waiting for approval. I have a lot of opinions about this matter." The writer Lao She recently raised this issue when talking to reporters about the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in literary and art circles. He said that although the play is not complete enough, it is indeed worth watching. Some people think that the play exposes the shortcomings of high-ranking cadres in the army and are afraid that it will have a negative impact if it is performed. This intention is good. In fact, what is written in the play may not all be true. It is good as long as it has educational significance! Does the literary and art circle let a hundred flowers bloom, and the army doesn't?
    Recently, the reporter heard opinions from people in literary and art circles who felt the same way as Lao She about the delayed public performance of "Among Comrades." The drama troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began rehearsing this play last autumn, and it has been in rehearsal since mid-January this year, with twenty-three internal review and observation performances, but it has not yet been publicly performed.
    On the 9th, the reporter went to the rehearsal hall of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Xinjiekou North Street and saw the director and actors still rehearsing this play. What kind of play is this? It has been "bottled up" until now and cannot be performed publicly. It turns out that the play depicts the divisional-level leading cadres stationed on the coastal front line, reflecting the contradiction between loyalty and honesty and individualism. The playwright Chen Qitong, who was sitting next to me, pointed to the character "Commander Dong" on the stage and said, "My main goal is to create such an old cadre who is wholeheartedly working for the Party." At the same time, he pointed to the character "Deputy Political Commissar Qiu" on the stage and said to me, "There are also people like him who engage in individualism and compete for power and status in real life. Moreover, the petty-bourgeois ideology in people's minds needs to be overcome for a long time. However, some people cannot accept this play after seeing it." Chen Qitong said meaningfully here, "This play was not written by me all at once. I prepared it for several years. I have been rehearsing this play for the past few months, so I have no time to write anything else!" While talking to me, he was busy discussing with the staff of the troupe about sending out invitations to invite leading comrades from various departments and people from literary and art circles to review it again. From time to time, he asked the stage staff to tidy up the faded scenery on the stage. At this time, I interjected and asked, "This play has not yet been publicly performed, why is the scenery so old?" A comrade next to me said with a smile, "This was made when we rehearsed last autumn."
    What is the reason for the delay in the public performance of this play? With this question in mind, I visited the drama troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and learned that there are many reasons why literary and art work in the army cannot be boldly "unleashed," but the main reason is still the issue of approval from the leadership. After "Among Comrades" was produced, the leadership was invited to review it, and people from literary and art circles were invited to give their opinions. Many large and small meetings have been held, but the play is still "bottled up" in the troupe.
    Some people believe that the theme of this play is good and has educational significance. It criticizes and exposes individualism in the army life on the stage, and it also establishes characters who are loyal, honest, and diligent in their work, so it can be performed publicly.
    However, some leading comrades have criticized that there are many issues worth considering in this play. For example, the individualism of the deputy political commissar criticized in the play is not realistic and has no typical significance. Some people also said that the play exposes the shortcomings of senior cadres in the army too much, and putting serious individualistic thoughts on the political commissar has a negative impact on the army. Some even suggested that the target audience for this play should only be cadres above the intermediate level in the army, and it is not suitable for local audiences and lower-level cadres in the army, because the problems reflected in the play are too many and look scary. Although this play is a bold attempt to intervene in army life, it should be considered carefully. These opinions were all expressed by senior leaders. And the leading department has not approved it for a long time, how dare the troupe perform it?
    The leading comrades of the troupe felt that their troupe, bearing the title of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, represents the political organs of the army, so the plays they rehearse must be refined and only taken out after review and approval. It seems that they also have their own difficulties. Chen Qitong, the playwright of "Among Comrades," revised the script back and forth according to the opinions put forward by the leading comrades of the relevant departments. The actors rehearsed repeatedly. The leaders' requests to improve the play are all well-intentioned, but the playwrights and actors have their own difficulties in being "unleashed" for a long time. It cannot be said that there are still serious obstacles in implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy in literary and art work in the army.
    It is said that not only people in Beijing's literary and art circles are interested in this play, but some local troupes are also interested. Although it has not yet been performed in Beijing, some troupes have already requested the script from the drama troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, preparing to rehearse it.

    “同志间”为何迟迟不公演
        新华社记者　孙世恺
   “陈其通新写的话剧‘同志间’，在内部审查观摩演出很久，到现在还不肯拿出来和广大观众见面，据说要等批准，对这件事我很有意见。”作家老舍最近对记者谈起文艺界贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针时提出了这个问题。他说，这出戏虽还不够完整，但确有戏可看。有人认为剧中暴露了部队高级干部的缺点怕演出来影响不好，这个用心是好的。其实，戏中写的不一定都是真事，它有教育意义就好嘛！难道文艺界百花齐放，部队就不百花齐放吗？
    记者近来听到文艺界人士对“同志间”迟迟不公演的意见，是和老舍提出的这个问题有同感的。中国人民解放军总政治部文工团话剧团去年秋天开始排演这出戏，从今年1月中旬就彩排，内部审查观摩演出二十三场，至今还没有公演。
    9日，记者到新街口北大街中国人民解放军总政治部文工团排演场，看到导演和演员们还在排演这出戏。这究竟是个什么样的戏呢？一直“闷”到现在不能公演。原来是剧中描写驻防沿海前线的师级领导干部们，反映了忠诚老实和个人主义的矛盾。坐在我身旁的编导陈其通指着舞台上的剧中人“董师长”说：“我主要是塑造这样忠心耿耿为党工作的老干部。”同时，他又指着台上的“丘副政委”那个人物，对我说：“像他这样闹个人主义争权夺地位的人，在实际生活中也不是没有的。何况人们思想意识中的小资产阶级思想是需要长期克服的。可是有些人看了这个戏就接受不了。”陈其通谈到这里意味深长地说：“这个戏不是我一下写出来的，准备了好几年，近几个月排演这个戏，就没功夫再写别的啦！”他一边和我谈话，一边忙着和剧团工作人员商量发请柬，请各部门领导同志和文艺界人士再来审查。时而，他又要求舞台人员把台上已退色的布景再整理一下。这时，我插进一句话问道：“这个戏还未公演，布景怎么旧得这样？”旁边一个同志笑着说：“这还是去年秋天排演时做的。”
    这出戏迟迟不公演的原因在哪里？我带着这个疑问走访总政治部文工团话剧团，了解到部队文艺工作不能大胆地“放”，虽然是有多方面的原因，主要还是领导上点头批准的问题。“同志间”这出戏排出后，请领导上审查，又邀文艺界人士提意见，大会小会开过许多次，戏依然“闷”在剧团里。
    有些人认为这个戏的主题思想是好的，有教育意义。在舞台上既批评、揭发了部队生活中的个人主义，又树立了忠诚老实、勤恳工作的人物，可以拿出来演。
    但是，有些领导同志却指责这出戏中存在许多值得考虑的问题。如剧中批评的副政委的个人主义不真实，没有典型意义。也有人说，戏中暴露部队高级干部的缺点过分了，把严重的个人主义思想摆在政委身上，对部队的影响不好。甚而有人提议这出戏演出的对象只能是部队的中级以上的干部，不适宜于地方观众和部队下级干部看，因为剧中反映的问题多，看起来可怕，虽然这个戏在干预部队生活方面是个大胆的尝试，但应该慎重地考虑。这些意见都是上级领导同志谈出来的。而领导部门又长期未点头批准，剧团怎敢演出呢？
    剧团的领导同志感到他们的剧团带着中国人民解放军总政治部文工团的头衔，代表部队的政治机关工作，所以排演的戏都要精益求精，只有经过审查批准才拿出去，看来，他们也有他们的苦衷。“同志间”的编导陈其通根据有关方面领导同志提出的意见，把剧本改来改去。演员们反复排演。领导要求把戏搞好都是一片好心，可是长期“放”不出来，编导和演员自有苦衷。这不能不说，在部队文艺工作中贯彻“百花齐放”的方针还存在着严重的阻力。
    据说，不仅北京文艺界人士对这出戏感到兴趣，有些外地的剧团也感兴趣。尽管北京还未上演，有些剧团已向总政治部文工团话剧团索取剧本，准备排演。
