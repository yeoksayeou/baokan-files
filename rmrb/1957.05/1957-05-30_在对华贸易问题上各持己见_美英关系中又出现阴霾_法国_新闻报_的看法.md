Xinhua News Agency, May 29th – A recent dispatch from London published in the Paris newspaper "Le Monde" stated that Anglo-American relations have entered a new period of difficulty. The dispatch pointed out that this comes after Anglo-American relations had barely overcome the crisis caused by the Suez Canal incident, and this time, the issue involves trade with China.

The article emphasized the different considerations of the United States and the United Kingdom on the issue of trade with China. It stated that although Britain has learned that the U.S. government is unwilling to make any concessions on this issue in order to avoid creating dissatisfaction in Congress, Britain is also determined to relax trade with China for reasons of foreign policy.

The newspaper believes that it is significant that the British government has announced the appointment of trade expert Wilson to replace O’Neill as Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing.

The dispatch further mentioned the rumors recently revealed regarding the British Queen's visit to the United States. It said that some people are saying that the reason no arrangements for the Queen's visit to Eisenhower have been announced is due to the various shadows that have appeared in Anglo-American relations. The Foreign Office's explanation of this issue is very embarrassing. According to official sources, the Queen cannot visit Canada at the same time as visiting the United States, and her schedule is too full, and she will visit Canada in 1959 anyway, and it would be best to postpone the trip across the Atlantic until then.

    在对华贸易问题上各持己见
    美英关系中又出现阴霾
    法国“新闻报”的看法
    新华社29日讯　巴黎“新闻报”不久前刊载的一篇伦敦通讯说，英美关系进入了一个新的困难时期。这篇通讯指出，这是在英美关系好不容易才度过了由于苏伊士事件而形成的危机之后出现的，这一次，涉及的问题是对中国贸易。
    这篇文章强调指出了美英两国在对中国贸易问题上的不同考虑。它说，尽管英国已经获悉美国政府为了避免造成国会的不满，不肯在这个问题上作任何让步，但是为了外交政策的原因，英国也下定决心要放松对中国的贸易。
    这家报纸认为，意味深长的是：英国官方已经宣布任命贸易专家威尔逊接替欧念儒担任驻北京代办。
    这篇通讯进一步提到前些日子透露的有关英国女王访问美国的事情。它说，有人在说关于女王访问艾森豪威尔还没有宣布任何安排，是由于英美关系上出现了这种种阴霾。外交部对这个问题的解释是十分狼狈的。据官方透露，女王不能在访问美国的同时不到加拿大去，又说她的日程太挤了，说她总之将在1959年到加拿大去访问，而最好把横渡大西洋之行推到那时再说。
