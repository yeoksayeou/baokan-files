    Season of Flowers
    Yang Shuo
    There is a very humane line in ancient Chinese poetry that says, "On every festive occasion, one thinks even more of one's dear ones." Today, with the world of human life so broad, one certainly doesn't only think of one's own relatives, but festive occasions still evoke endless poignant emotions.

    Just over two months ago, I returned to China from Africa, passing through Moscow, where I stayed for a few short days. What did I want to see most? Red Square. This was my third time there. In the past, there had been many nights when, with a sense of longing, I strolled in Red Square until the night was deep and still. This time, on the very night I was about to leave Moscow, I squeezed out some precious time to walk around Red Square again. This winter in Moscow was a bit strange, with not much snow, and sometimes even sleet. At night, it was still very cold. I braved the cold, wandering outside the Kremlin, gazing at Lenin's Mausoleum, and then at the ruby red star flashing in the sky, my heart soaring into the clouds. That star, in the very distant past, had shone for me on so many difficult night paths.

    It was an old story from seventeen years ago. At that time, the night was still very long, very cold, and China was still in the darkest moment before dawn. At that time, I was active in an anti-Japanese guerrilla unit on the great plains of southern Beijing, Hebei. Japanese soldiers built blockhouses and strongholds everywhere on the plains, densely dotted, like a net spread out. Our guerrilla unit moved back and forth through the meshes of the net. We had to march and move our quarters almost every night, so that the enemy couldn't figure out our movements, but we could unexpectedly pounce on the enemy from behind and deal them a blow.

    The fighting was fierce and frequent, and we often didn't remember the days clearly. But everyone remembered major festivals like "May Day" clearly. That year, the festival was particularly early. Around May Day, the wheat in the plains was already knee-deep, with a yellowish hue. A few days earlier, a part of the guerrilla unit had ambushed the enemy in the wheat fields. On May Day, they specially slaughtered a pig, and someone even fished a bucket of live crucian carp from the river. Everyone had a good meal together to celebrate this victorious festival. After dinner at dusk, the soldiers who could sing and play instruments got together and planned to hold an impromptu evening party, but news came that the enemy was on the move. Everyone packed up their luggage, which had already been prepared, and took advantage of the night to move away.

    A dark cloud surged up from the horizon, covering the sky in an instant. The wind picked up, and the road was difficult to walk. Around the third watch of the night, the column suddenly stopped. At this time, I was following behind the chief of staff of the guerrilla unit. This man was a veteran Red Army soldier who had gone through the Long March, both bold and experienced, and he personally rushed to the front of the column.

    It turned out that the column had stopped at a three-way intersection, and the peasant guide had lost his way again, not knowing which road to take. A few gunshots sounded in the distance. Looking around, everything was dark and unclear, and occasionally a searchlight would light up from the enemy's stronghold, sweeping back and forth. This was a very dangerous moment. One wrong step and we would walk into the enemy's nest.

    The chief of staff stood motionless, looking at the sky. The wind in the sky rolled the flying clouds, sometimes revealing a patch of stars here, and sometimes revealing a patch there. I heard the chief of staff say in a low voice, "Isn't that the North Star!"

    I looked up and saw a large star shining brightly in the cloud seam, right in front of us. With the direction fixed, the chief of staff strode forward, stepped onto the middle road, and led the column straight north.

    I was still a little hesitant and asked softly from behind, "Is the road right?"

    The chief of staff said in a low voice, "With the North Star as our guide, can we be wrong?"

    I asked again, "Where can we go along this road?"

    The chief of staff smiled softly and said, "We can walk into Beijing, and even all the way to Moscow."

    Many years later, when I actually arrived in Moscow, I looked at the red star in Red Square and suddenly felt as if this was the North Star hanging right in front of us on the night road. And it was along the road guided by this red star that the Chinese people finally entered today's socialism.

    It is now late spring, and before our eyes is the May Day of 1957. April and May in Beijing are the best seasons for flowers to bloom. There is still wind and rain. However, an ancient Chinese saying goes, "One gust of wind, one kind of flower blooms. After twenty-four gusts of wind, all the flowers can bloom." Without contending with the wind and rain, spring cannot arrive properly. And this year, during this season of flowers, an unfading flower floated from Moscow to Beijing. This great flower is Comrade Voroshilov, whom the Chinese people are welcoming with a rain of colorful flowers. At that moment, when he and Comrade Mao Zedong embraced each other, we clearly saw the victorious future that humanity is creating. Flowers symbolize spring, and the moon symbolizes unity. On this festive occasion, let me offer two traditional Chinese phrases to express a renewed blessing for Sino-Soviet friendship:

    May the flowers always be beautiful!
    May the moon always be full!

    百花时节
    杨朔
    中国古代有句人情味极浓的诗，叫做：“每逢佳节倍思亲”。到今天，人类生活的天地这样开阔，当然不一定只是思念自己的亲人，可是，每逢节日，还是会引起你无限低回的情绪的。
    刚刚两个多月前，我从非洲回中国来，路过莫斯科，曾经停留过短短的几天。什么是我最想看的呢？红场。这是我第三次来了。过去，也曾有不少的夜晚，我怀着一种恋恋的心情，在红场上一直漫步到夜深人静。这回，趁我将要离开莫斯科的当夜，我分出点紧而又紧的时间，还是到红场走了走。今年莫斯科的冬天有点怪，雪不多，有时雪里还夹着寒雨。到晚上，冷还是十分冷的。我冒着严寒，徘徊在克里姆林宫外，望着列宁墓，再望望那闪在半空的宝石的红星，我的心便飞到云彩里去。这颗星，在那很远很远的过去，曾经为我照过多么艰难的夜路啊。
    说起来已经是十七年前的旧事。那时候，夜还长的很，冷的很，中国还处在黎明前最黑暗的时刻里；那时候，我正在北京南部河北大平原上一支抗日游击队里活动。日本兵在平原上四处修炮楼安据点，密密点点，真像撒开的网似的。我们的游击队就在网眼里穿来穿去。差不多每夜都要行军，挪动住处，这样使敌人捉摸不透我们的行动，我们却能冷不防从背后扑到敌人身上去，收拾他们一顿。
    战斗是激烈而又频繁，我们经常不大记得清日子。对于“五一”这类大节，每个人却记得清清楚楚。这一年，节期特别早，将近五一节，平原上遍地的麦子已经有膝盖深，透出黄笼笼的颜色。头几天，一部分游击队在麦地里打了敌人一次伏击，到五一节那天，就特意宰了口猪，有人还从河里摸了一桶活鲫鱼，大家美美会了一次餐，庆祝这个胜利的节日。黄昏饭后，那些会拉会唱的战士凑到一起，还打算举行个临时晚会，不想传来敌人出动的消息，大家便背起早就收拾停当的行李，趁着夜色上来，转移开去。
    天边上涌起一片黑云，转眼布满天空，又起了风，路很不好走。约莫走到三更天，队伍忽然停住不动了。我这时正跟在游击队的参谋长身后。这人是个经过两万五千里长征的老红军，又大胆，又老练，当时亲自赶到队伍的最前头去。
    原来队伍停在一个三岔路口，做向导的农民又迷了方向，不知该走那条路。远远响了几声枪。四面一望，黑糊糊的什么都辨不清，时而会从敌人据点里亮起一道探照灯光，扫来扫去。这是很险的一刻，错一步路，准会走进敌人的窠里去。
    参谋长一动不动地望着天。天上风卷着飞云，忽而这里露出一片星星，忽而那里又露出一片。只听见参谋长低声喊了句：“那不是北极星！”
    我仰起头一望，果然看见云缝里闪出一颗大星，亮铮铮的，正对着我们。方向一定，参谋长便迈开大步，跨上正中那条路，领着队伍一直朝北走去。
    我还有点迟疑，从背后小声问道：“路不错吧？”
    参谋长低声说：“有北极星引路，还会错？”
    我又问道：“沿着这条路能走到那儿去？”
    参谋长悄声笑笑说：“能走进北京去，再远还能一直走到莫斯科呢。”
    许多年后，当我果真到了莫斯科，我望着红场上空的红星，忽然觉得好像这就是那颗悬在我们夜路正前方的北极星。也正是沿着这颗红星指引的道路，中国人民到底走进今天的社会主义来。
    时当暮春，眼前正是1957年的五一节。4、5月的北京，最是百花盛开的好季节。风雨还是有的。不过中国相传的古话说，刮一场风，开一种花，刮过二十四番风，百花才能开齐。不跟风雨相争，春天便不能好好到来。而今年，正当这样的百花时节，一朵不谢之花从莫斯科飘到北京。这朵大花便是中国人民用缤纷花雨迎接着的伏罗希洛夫同志。在那一刻，当他和毛泽东同志互相拥抱在一起时，我们分明看见了人类正在创造的胜利的未来。花是春天，月亮象征着团结。又逢佳节，让我用两句中国传统的词句，为中苏友谊献出意义翻新的祝颂：
    愿花常好！
    愿月常圆！
