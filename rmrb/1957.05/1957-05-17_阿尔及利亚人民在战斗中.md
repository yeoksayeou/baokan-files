    The French imperialists have launched a devastating war against the working class and people of Algeria. But despite having 600,000 soldiers and 100,000 police in Algeria, despite their massacres, robberies, and the burning of our villages, despite their most modern equipment and the notorious "Psychological Bureaus," they cannot force the Algerian people to their knees. The Algerian people are united around the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army, determined to continue fighting until final victory is won.

    In view of the strong unity of the Algerian people, the French imperialists, in order to maintain their colonial rule, not only obtain arms from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but also appeal to the American imperialists to meddle with the resources of Algeria. The French government, led by the Socialists, also attempts to revive Hitler's old dream of a European-African continent through the establishment of a common market, introducing German imperialists into Africa in order to strengthen French colonial rule, exploitation, and suppression.

    The extension of American power into Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, just like the introduction of German imperialist power, is by no means beneficial to the liberation of the North African people.

    The cold facts prove that the war policy pursued by the French colonialists in Algeria not only violates the interests of the French people who bear all the costs of this "dirty war," but also brings significant damage to the not-so-wonderful French economy.

    Moreover, the gulf between the Algerian people and France is getting deeper and deeper. Military operations, sweeps, torture, the "achievements" of paratroopers in Algerian cities and villages, concentration camps, the execution of those hastily sentenced to death without adequate defense—all these deepen this gulf of blood and hatred.

    In French and North African political circles, as well as various social strata, there are some French people who are very clear-sighted, who uphold the honor of the French nation, and advocate telling the truth and adhering to the truth. The brave French people, led by the French Communist Party, bravely continue their struggle, regardless of the colonialists targeting them and regardless of the persecution by the Mollet government. This is an encouragement to the Algerian working class and people.

    The Algerian working class and people are fighting to destroy the feudal system. Under the feudal system, a small number of European residents control the power, and they commit outrages against the Muslim residents. This handful of people who fantasize about turning North Africa into another South Africa have dragged France into a war against the Algerian people in order to maintain their huge privileges. These lawless colonialists are willing to sacrifice the lives of French soldiers in order to protect the millions of hectares of farmland and mineral resources they have seized from the Algerian people. Those most radical colonial elements deposit their funds in American or Belgian banks, ensuring their own escape route while pushing France into the abyss. However, the Algerian working class and people are united around the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army, they hope to break the shackles, hope to live a life of freedom and dignity, and their courage cannot be thwarted by any army.

    Following Vietnam, Tunisia, and Morocco, Algeria is now launching a revolution for liberation under tragic circumstances. The barbaric methods used by the French colonialists to suppress the Algerian people and the piecemeal reforms announced to deceive public opinion are out of date and cannot resist the moral forces around them that are looking to the future. Can they see this clearly?

    It should also be estimated that the Algerian revolution is not being carried out under the guidance of a theory that has already matured, but its occurrence is not accidental. Before the National Liberation Front took the courageous initiative to launch an armed uprising in November 1954, there had been continuous struggles and ideological struggles, and years of experience have adapted to the changes of the times in an undulating manner.

    This struggle is undulating. It once created a mythical tendency around it, using the prestige of certain people as a rallying force, weakening the collective spirit of struggle that draws strength from everyone.

    In the modern history of Algeria, people have never underestimated the National Liberation Front's contribution to saving Algeria's patriotic crisis. Algerian patriotism had fallen into a serious crisis of being detached from the most active masses of the people, thereby losing the people's faith. The armed uprising in November 1954 was tantamount to a plebiscite for the people, at least it can be said that this epoch-making event expressed the people's wishes, and it was the prelude to a real national uprising. Relying on isolated plans, relying on individual political groups or parties, without contacting other parties and the masses, it is impossible to effectively fight against the French colonialists. Because the French colonialists, relying on a huge army, police, countless privileges, a strong lobby, incitement and false propaganda that attract countless people, constitute a political, economic, and social whole. Thanks to the contribution of the National Liberation Front, the people's forces, which account for the vast majority in number, have finally enthusiastically responded to the national battle call and are better organized. From then on, the entire people are united in defending their cause.

    The vivid solidarity of socialist countries, Asian and African countries, and the international working class also greatly contribute to the cause of liberation of the Algerian people and world peace.

    阿尔及利亚人民在战斗中
      阿尔及利亚总工会书记　乌治娜·德里斯
    法帝国主义者向阿尔及利亚的工人阶级与人民发动了一个毁灭性的战争。但是，尽管他们在阿尔及利亚有六十万名兵士和十万名警察，尽管他们屠杀、抢劫，并且纵火焚烧我们的村庄，尽管他们有最新式的配备和闻名的“心理局”，他们并不能迫使阿尔及利亚人民屈膝。阿尔及利亚人民一致团结在民族解放阵线与民族解放军的周围，决心继续战斗直到获得最后的胜利。
    鉴于阿尔及利亚人民的坚强团结，法帝国主义者为了维持它的殖民统治，不仅从北大西洋公约集团取得军火，而且呼吁美帝国主义者来染指阿尔及利亚的富源。在社会党人领导下的法国政府，还企图通过建立共同市场，重温希特勒的欧非大陆的旧梦，把德帝国主义者引入非洲，借以加强法国的殖民统治、剥削与镇压。
    美国势力伸入阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥，正与把德帝国主义势力引进来一样，决不是对北非人民解放有益的事。
    冷酷的事实证明，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚奉行的战争政策，不但违反担负这场“肮脏战争”全部费用的法国人民的利益，也对光景不十分美妙的法国经济带来了重大的损害。
    而且，阿尔及利亚人民与法国之间的鸿沟愈来愈深了。军事行动、扫荡、酷刑、降落伞兵士在阿尔及利亚城乡的“战绩”、集中营、对那些在缺乏辩护的情况下草率地被判死刑的人的处决，这一切都加深了这道血与仇恨的鸿沟。
    在法国与北非的政界以及各种社会阶层里，都有一些认识很清楚的法国人，他们维护法国民族的荣誉，主张说实话、坚持真理。以法国共产党为首的勇敢的法国人民，不顾殖民者把他们当作攻击的对象，不顾摩勒政府的迫害，勇敢地继续进行斗争。这对阿尔及利亚的工人阶级与人民说来，是一种鼓舞。
    阿尔及利亚工人阶级与人民为摧毁封建制度在进行着斗争。在封建制度下，居于少数地位的欧洲籍人控制了权力，他们对回教居民胡作非为。这一小撮幻想着把北非变成另一个南非的人，为了维护自己的巨大的特权，已经把法国拖入了反对阿尔及利亚人民的战争。无法无天的殖民者为了保护他们从阿尔及利亚人民那里夺过来的数百万公顷耕地与矿产资源，不惜牺牲法国兵士的生命。那些最激烈的殖民分子，把他们的资金存在美国或比利时的银行里，保证了自己的退路，而把法国推进深渊。可是，阿尔及利亚工人阶级与人民一致团结在民族解放阵线与民族解放军的周围，他们希望打破枷锁，希望过着自由与尊严的生活，他们的勇气不是任何军队可以挫折的。
    继越南、突尼斯、摩洛哥之后，现在，阿尔及利亚在悲惨的境况下发动了争取解放的革命。法国殖民者使用的镇压阿尔及利亚人民的野蛮方法和为了欺骗舆论而宣布的零星的改革都不合时了，都不能与四周的瞩目于未来的道义力量相抗衡。他们能看清这一点吗？
    还应该估计到：阿尔及利亚的革命并不是在早已成熟了的理论指导下进行的，但是，它的发生也不是偶然的。在1954年11月民族解放阵线采取勇敢的主动性发动武装起义以前，就有过继续不断的战斗与思想斗争，多年以来的经验起伏不停地随着时代的嬗变而适应着。
    这种斗争是起伏不停的。它曾经一度在周围造成了一种神话的倾向，以某些人的威望来作为号召力量，削弱了从一切人吸取力量的斗争的集体精神。
    在阿尔及利亚的现代史里，人们从来没有低估过民族解放阵线挽救阿尔及利亚爱国主义巨大危机的功绩。阿尔及利亚的爱国主义曾经陷入与最积极的人民群众脱节、从而失去人民信仰的严重危机。1954年11月的武装起义不啻让人民进行了一种公民投票，至少可以这样说，这个划时代的事件表达了人们的愿望，它是一个真正的民族起义的序幕。凭借孤立的计划，依赖个别的政治团体或政党，不与其他党派及群众联系，是不能对法国殖民者进行有效的斗争的。因为法国殖民者凭借着庞大的军队、警察、无数的特权、强而有力的院外集团、吸引无数人的煽动与虚伪的宣传，构成一个政治、经济、社会的整体。由于民族解放阵线的贡献，在数量上占绝大优势的人民力量，终于踊跃地响应了民族的战斗号召，更好地组织起来了。从此以后，全体人民团结一致保卫着自己的事业。
    社会主义国家、亚非国家以及国际工人阶级生动的团结，也大有助于阿尔及利亚人民的解放事业与世界的和平。
