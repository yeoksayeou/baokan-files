    Greetings to the Soldiers Loyal to the Motherland and Loving Korea!
    Feng Zheng
    In the motherland, spring has long since arrived! How happy and comfortable it must be to live in the motherland! Yet, at this moment, in Korea, in a thatched hut on the world-renowned Shangganling, I am having a heart-to-heart conversation with a group of soldiers who miss their motherland. Outside the hut, goose-feather snow is falling, and there is no sign of spring. But when we talk about the motherland and our loved ones, it is as if we are bathing in the gentle spring breeze, and we do not feel the cold at all.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers have been in Korea for seven years, and the Korean armistice has been in place for more than three years.
    During these years, our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Factory chimneys have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain, and tractors have begun to appear on large tracts of land where the field ridges have been leveled. Groups of men and women are working collectively; the Yangtze River Bridge, spanning natural barriers, is being rushed to completion, and the Sanmenxia project on the Yellow River has already begun; children who were just born when we entered Korea are now carrying their schoolbags and starting school... All of these things about the motherland are topics of concern and discussion for the volunteer soldiers. Dear friends, in these days in Korea, I feel like I have stepped into a university that cultivates noble human emotions. I am deeply moved by the volunteer soldiers' ardent feelings of missing their motherland and their loyalty to internationalism.
    In the post-war period, the transition from war to peace is a significant change. Perhaps some people think that since there is no fighting, the volunteer soldiers have nothing to do, right? That life is good, right? In short, everyone is concerned about the volunteer soldiers. The soldiers are deeply grateful for this. However, things are not that simple. In a sentry post on Shangganling, I and the soldiers heard the rumbling of artillery fire. The soldiers said that it has been like this since the armistice. This is the US-ROK military preparing for a new war. Zhao Zuoshan, an old soldier who entered Korea in 1950 and is now the leader of a militia squad, pointed to the mountain fortress more than a hundred meters away and said to me, "That is the US-ROK military's position. They often use the darkness of night and snowy, rainy, and foggy weather to send special agents to sneak across the border. Just below the small high ground in front, we caught several spies who had infiltrated our territory last year!" The soldiers clearly know that South Korea is actually a messy large military camp, with troops from the US, Britain, Turkey, and Canada. Syngman Rhee has increased the number of divisions from twenty to more than forty. This old and immortal running dog and villain shouts every day about marching north, saying that he wants to tear up the armistice agreement. The soldiers understand that defending the 38th parallel is related to the greatest interests of the Korean and Chinese people and world peace. Precisely because of this, in peacetime, they still carry out guard duties non-stop, day and night, regardless of the cold or heat. In the severe winter and early spring, Mount Osong is covered in crystalline white, and the temperature sometimes reaches minus forty degrees. At the moment when our loved ones in the motherland are sound asleep, the soldiers are patrolling and meeting on the mountains, sometimes with their feet injured and their hands frozen, still watching the movements on the demarcation line with rapt attention. An old soldier from Sichuan told me that one snowy night last winter, he was lying in ambush at a mountain pass. The snow was getting heavier and heavier, almost burying him, but he knew that this was also a good opportunity for the enemy to move, so he must not leave his post. Suddenly, he saw a white thing wriggling towards him. But his body was numb from the cold and he couldn't stand up for a while. After the fellow entered our side of the demarcation line, he pounced on him and held him down, capturing a disguised special agent alive. This soldier said: "In peacetime, if you relax even a little, peace may not be guaranteed!" I was encouraged and admired by the soldiers' high sense of responsibility for maintaining the cause of peace.
    Dear friends, you may think that this is the soldiers' duty. Yes, the People's Liberation Army soldiers who defend the borders, islands, territorial seas, and territorial airspace in the country are also like this. However, the volunteer soldiers are abroad, and in the eyes of the Korean people, their every move represents the Chinese people. This was the case during the war, and it is still the case in peacetime. While carrying out guard and training tasks, our volunteer soldiers must also regard unity with the Korean people as a serious, regular, and major political task. Our volunteer soldiers have not let down the trust of the Korean people, nor have they tarnished the honor of the motherland. They "cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass and every tree of the Korean people," and in the difficult days after the war, they shared weal and woe with the Korean people, using their own blood and sweat to consolidate and promote the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    At a banquet in Pyongyang, a member of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, a senior general of the Korean People's Army, said to me: "When the crazy enemy was approaching the Yalu River, and our country was at a critical moment of survival, the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the Yalu River with overwhelming force. At that time, I was moved to tears by the Chinese people's highly internationalist spirit of righteous courage! And now, in our capital Pyongyang, right across from our office, that row of tall buildings was built for us by the volunteer comrades on the ruins bombed by the American robbers. The volunteer comrades have built many houses, dikes, and bridges for us, treating our disasters as their own disasters. The help that the volunteer comrades have given us in the extremely difficult days after the war is a great encouragement to the Korean people." The general said to me with tears in his eyes: "Please convey our Korean people's sincere gratitude to the Chinese people."
    This is certainly not accidental. After the war, under the slogan of "Helping the Korean people rebuild their homes as if they were building their own motherland," the volunteer soldiers carried out tremendous labor for the Korean people. I once visited the Pyonggang, Sepo, and Chorwon lines. During the war, this was the heroic front. Volunteer heroes Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, and Zhang Yongyi, and Korean internationalist fighters Park Jae-geun, Gu Buri, and Seok Geum-yeong all became famous here. After the war, this heroic hometown was scarred and almost without a complete house. At that time, 85% of the residents returned from all directions, and life was extremely difficult. Baek Heung-gi, the chairman of the Sepo County Party Committee, said: "At that time, as soon as the refugees arrived, the volunteer comrades would vacate their houses, provide meals, and give their own cultivated land to the residents to plant, and also supply seeds and fertilizer." He said, "Like our offices, dormitories, schools, and some residents' houses, they were mostly built with the help of volunteer comrades. Even the lighting equipment, heating stoves, and office supplies in our organs were partially solved with the assistance of volunteer comrades." What the soldiers remember most are the orphans who lost their parents in the war. The volunteer units had raised many Korean orphans during and after the war. Many units also built kindergartens and transferred the children to the Korean government. Some children were reluctant to leave and ran from far away to see "Volunteer Army Uncles." An old mother in Kohori, who was over seventy years old, cut off her hair and wove it into shoes for the volunteer soldiers, expressing her greatest respect and gratitude. This kind of epic cast by internationalist sentiments tightly links the hearts of the Korean people and the volunteer soldiers.
    Our soldiers are all sons of the working people, imbued with internationalist sentiments, and regard helping the Korean people restore and develop production as their glorious obligation. Last year, the Political Department of the Volunteer Army required the entire army to contribute 600,000 workdays to help the Korean people produce in a planned way, and as a result, helped 724,000 workdays. The greatest help to the Korean people's production and the most welcomed by the Korean people was water conservancy construction. Last year, the volunteer soldiers repaired 500 large canals and dams for the Korean people, with a total length of more than 300 Chinese miles. The "South Pyongan Irrigation Main Canal," which caused a sensation throughout Korea, was a huge project that the Korean people had been yearning for for many years but had not been able to build. The volunteer soldiers mobilized more than 10,000 people to participate in the construction and completed it victoriously in more than half a month. This March, the volunteer soldiers of a certain regiment who were about to be demobilized learned that the residents of Seongsan-ri, where they were stationed, wanted to cut cliffs to open canals, so they voluntarily requested to contract for the construction of this project as a farewell gift to the Korean people. The eighty of them went early and returned late, completing it in seven days. Kim In-bo, a sixty-one-year-old man here, said: "A wish of more than twenty years, the volunteer soldiers have helped us realize it today!" Liu Rushi, a fifty-six-year-old disabled old man, ground a stone and erected a monument for the volunteer soldiers.
    Korean comrades also told me many stories of the volunteer soldiers rescuing people from danger and disaster.
    Last autumn, Songpo-ri had continuous heavy rains, and the dikes breached. The floodwaters were surging fiercely. The soldiers of Wu Mingan's platoon of the Volunteer Army rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. The soldiers blocked the floodwaters with their bodies and quickly blocked the breach, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the people of Songpo-ri. A mountain fire broke out in the Cheokdong forest area, and the residents of the mountainous area were anxiously helpless. More than 2,000 soldiers of the nearby Volunteer Army construction unit saw the mountain fire and ran up the mountain. Some soldiers' clothes were burned, but they finally risked their lives to put out the fire and preserved the forest area. There are many stories like this of sacrificing oneself to save others. Volunteer soldiers Huang Zhifu and Lai Hewen of a certain Volunteer Army unit jumped into an ice cave on November 28 last year and rescued a fourteen-year-old child, Li Zhanhuan. Soldiers Jiang Songqing and Gu Fayu also dived into an ice river and saved the lives of two children. Comrade Jiang Songqing became seriously ill as a result. The Korean people called them "living Luo Shengjiao." Their internationalist character and deeds were widely praised by the Korean people.
    The volunteer soldiers regard the Korean residents in their area who suffer from serious and acute illnesses as their own relatives and actively assist in their treatment. Last year, they treated 46,904 people from Korea. The health departments of some units have also divided treatment areas, implementing "no one is refused, requests are responded to immediately, emergency treatment is given for emergency cases, and careful responsibility is taken." In order to save the life of Korean railway worker Kim Seon-bon, six comrades in a certain field hospital donated blood for him. Han Heung-guk, a member of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and Vice Minister of Agriculture, was transferred to the hospital due to severe pulmonary tuberculosis. Thanks to careful consultation and timely treatment, the progress of the disease was quickly stopped.
    In order to thank the Korean people for their boundless love and strong support for the volunteer soldiers, the various units of the volunteer soldiers attach great importance to friendly exchanges with all aspects of Korea. Last year, the volunteer soldiers sent out 242 delegations, representing more than 11,000 people, and performed and screened movies for the Korean people 1,856 times. During the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, General Yang Yong, commander of the Volunteer Army, personally led 27 delegations and 6 cultural and art troupes to various units of the People's Army to express their condolences. They met with officers and soldiers of the People's Army universally. The comrades of the People's Army received them with the most solemn etiquette. Some even brought azaleas from the mountains to give to the representatives and actors to express their gratitude. As for mass friendly activities, they are even more common. These exchange activities are rich in content and sincere and enthusiastic in emotion. The Third Battalion of a certain Volunteer Army unit and the Third Battalion of a certain People's Army unit are neighbors guarding a certain place on the front line. They often conduct joint exercises, learn from each other, constantly write letters to encourage each other, invite each other to eat casual meals, and sometimes send people to participate in each other's weddings. After many units moved into barracks, they continued to send people to comfort the past landlords and neighbors, and some even brought the original landlords to the troops to celebrate the festival, making dumplings and eating wedding wine together. It can be said that they are as close as flesh and blood and as dear as family.
    In the Korean War and the difficult days after the war, our volunteer soldiers were so loyal to the motherland and loved the Korean people. Although time flies quickly, although they miss their motherland and their loved ones very much, they water the lovable land of this heroic country of Korea with their blood and sweat day and night. With a high degree of enthusiasm for loving the motherland, loving peace, and the cause of human progress, they vigilantly guard the 38th parallel together with the Korean people and help the heroic Korean people carry out restoration and construction as if they were building their beloved motherland.

    向忠于祖国、热爱朝鲜的战士们致意！
    冯征
    祖国早已是春暖花开的季节了！生活在祖国，该是多么幸福和惬意啊！然而，此刻，在朝鲜，在举世闻名的上甘岭上一间茅棚里，我正和一群怀念祖国的战士们促膝谈心。棚外鹅毛大雪飞舞，还不见春天的景色。但我们说起祖国和亲人，犹如沐浴在和煦的春风里一样，一点也没有想到寒冷。
    志愿军入朝已进入七个年头，朝鲜停战也已经三年多了。
    这些年月，我们的祖国历经了天大的变化。工厂的烟囱像雨后春笋般地竖立起来，被平没了田塍的大块土地上，开始出现了拖拉机，成群的男男女女集体劳动着；横跨天险的长江大桥正在赶修，黄河三门峡的工程已经开始；入朝时刚刚出生的孩子，现在已背起书包开始上学……。所有这些祖国的一切一切，都是志愿军战士们关切和谈论的话题。亲爱的朋友们：来朝鲜的这些时日，我好像跨进了一个培育人类高尚情感的大学校。我为志愿军战士们怀念祖国和忠于国际主义的炽热的心情而深深地感动着。
    在战后，从战争转入和平，这是一个很大的变化。也许有人以为不打仗，志愿军没事了吧？日子过得很好吧？总之，大家很关心志愿军。这一点，战士们都深为感激。但是，事情却并不那样简单。在上甘岭的一个哨棚里，我和战士们就听到了隆隆的炮声。战士们说，停战以来一直如此。这是美李军在进行新战争的准备。一个1950年入朝的老战士、现在当了民警分队长的赵佐山同志，他指着对面百多公尺的山堡对我说，那就是美李军的阵地，他们常常利用黑夜和风雪雨雾的天气，派遣特务，偷越境界。就在前面小高地的下面，去年我们就捉了若干个潜入我境的特务！战士们清楚地知道，南朝鲜实际上是个乱七八糟的大兵营，有美、英、土耳其、加拿大的军队。李承晚从二十个师增加到四十多个师，这个老而不死的走狗和恶棍，天天叫嚷北进，说要撕毁停战协定。战士们懂得：守卫“三八”线，关系着朝中两国人民和世界和平的最大利益。正因为如此，在和平时期，他们仍然不分昼夜、不分寒暑，不间断地执行警备的任务。在严冬和初春，五圣山一片晶白，气温有时达零下四十度。当祖国亲人们甜蜜入睡的时刻，战士们正爬山越岭巡逻会哨，有时脚刺伤了，手冻僵了，仍目不转睛地注视着分界线上的动静。一个四川籍的老战士告诉我说，去年冬天一个大风雪的黑夜，他在一个隘道口潜伏，雪越下越大，几乎把他埋了起来，但他知道这也是敌人活动的好时机，绝不能离开哨位。蓦地，他发现眼前一个白色的东西向他蠕动，但他的身体已被冻麻木了，一时站不起来，等那个家伙进入我方分界线之后，他就猛扑上去压住了他，活捉了一个化装的特务。这位战士说：“和平时期，你稍一松懈，和平就可能没有保障！”对战士们这种维护和平事业的高度责任感，我感到鼓舞和敬佩。
    亲爱的朋友，你也许觉得这是战士们份内的事。不错，在国内保卫着边疆、海岛和领海、领空的解放军战士们，也是如此的。但是，志愿军在国外，在朝鲜人民看来，他们的一举一动，都代表着中国人民。战时是这样，和平时期也是如此。我们的志愿军在执行警备、训练任务的同时，还必须把和朝鲜人民的团结，当成一件严肃的经常重大的政治任务去做。我们的志愿军战士没有辜负朝鲜人民的信赖，没有玷辱祖国的荣誉，他们“爱护朝鲜人民的一山一水，一草一木”，在战后困难的日子里，和朝鲜人民同甘共苦，用自己的血汗，巩固和推进了中朝人民的战斗友谊。
    在平壤一次宴会上，一位朝鲜劳动党中央委员、人民军某高级将领对我说：当疯狂的敌人直逼鸭绿江边，我们的祖国处在危急存亡的关头，兄弟般的中国志愿军以排山倒海之势开过鸭绿江来，当时，我为中国人民这种见义勇为的高度国际主义精神而感动得流泪！而现在，在我们的首都平壤，就在我们的办公室对面，那一排高大的楼房，就是志愿军同志在美国强盗炸成的废墟上，帮我们建立起来的。志愿军同志们为我们修筑了许多房屋、水堤和桥梁，把我们的灾难当成是自己的灾难，志愿军同志在战后极其困难的日子里，对我们的帮助，对朝鲜人民是极大的鼓舞。这位将军同志满含着热泪激动地对我说：“请把我们朝鲜人民诚挚的感谢之意，带给中国人民。”
    这当然不是偶然的。战后，志愿军在“像建设祖国一样，帮助朝鲜人民重建家园”的口号下，为朝鲜人民进行了巨大的劳动。我曾经访问过平康、西蒲、铁原一线。在战时这里是英雄的阵地。志愿军英雄黄继光、丘少云、孙占元、张永义，朝鲜国际主义的战士朴在根、具富力、石金荣都是从这里闻名于世的。战后，这个英雄的故乡，满目创伤，几乎没有一间完整的房子，那时，85％的居民从四面八方回来，日子异常艰难。西蒲郡党委员长白兴基同志说：“那时，难民一到，志愿军同志就给腾房子，打饭吃，把自己开好了的熟地给居民种，还供给种子及肥料。”他说：“像我们的办公室、宿舍、学校，还有一些居民的房子，多是志愿军同志帮助盖起来的，连我们机关的照明装置、取暖的炉子、办公用具有些也是志愿军同志协助解决的。”最使战士们难忘的是那些在战争中失去父母的孤儿。志愿军各部队在战时和战后都曾经养过许多朝鲜孤儿，不少部队还修建了幼儿园，把孩子们移交朝鲜政府，有些孩子舍不得离开，还从很远的地方跑来看“志愿军叔叔”。科湖里一个七十多岁的老妈妈，把自己的头发剪下来编成鞋子送给志愿军，表示最尊敬、最感激的意思。这类用国际主义情感铸成的史诗，把朝鲜人民和志愿军战士的心紧紧地联系在一起。
    我们的战士都是劳动人民的儿子，混身浸透了国际主义的情感，都把帮助朝鲜人民恢复与发展生产当成自己的光荣义务。去年，志愿军政治部要求全军有计划地出六十万工帮助朝鲜人民生产，结果帮助了七十二万四千多个劳动日。对朝鲜人民生产帮助最大和最受朝鲜人民欢迎的是兴修水利。去年志愿军为朝鲜人民修复大的渠坝五百条，长达三百多华里。轰动全朝鲜的“平南灌溉总渠”，是朝鲜人民多年来渴望而未能建成的巨大工程，志愿军动员了一万多人参加修建，半个多月就胜利完工。今年3月，志愿军某团行将复员的战士们，得知驻地成山里的居民想削崖开渠，便自动请求包修这个工程，作为临别对朝鲜人民的赠礼。他们八十个人早去晚归，七天即告完成。这里的六十一岁的金仁辅老大爷说：“二十多年的愿望，今天志愿军帮我们实现了！”五十六岁的残废老人刘如石磨了一块石头，为志愿军战士立碑。
    朝鲜同志们还告诉我志愿军许多抢险救灾的故事。
    去年秋天，松埔里连日大雨，堤防决口，洪水来势汹涌，志愿军某部吴明安排的战士，闻讯赶来，战士们以身挡住洪水，迅速堵住了决口，保证了松埔里人民的生命财产的安全。赤东林区一次发生了山火，山区居民焦急无方，附近志愿军营建部队两千多人，看见山火，就飞跑上山，有的战士衣服都被烧着了，但终于冒险捕灭了火灾，保全了林区。像这类舍己救人的故事是很多的。志愿军某部战士黄治富、赖和文，去年11月28日曾跳进冰窟救出一个十四岁的孩子李展焕。战士江松庆、顾发余也曾潜入冰河救过两个小孩的性命。江松庆同志曾因此得了重病，朝鲜人民都称他们为“活的罗盛教”，他们的国际主义的品德和事迹，被朝鲜人民广为传颂。
    志愿军对驻地患有重病和急病的朝鲜居民，看成是自己的亲人，积极协助治疗。去年，即为朝鲜人民治疗疾病达四万六千九百零四人次。有些单位的卫生部门还划分了治疗区域，实行“来者不拒，随请随到，急病急诊，细心负责”。某战地医院为救活朝鲜铁路工人金善本，院内六个同志为之输血，朝鲜劳动党中央委员、农业副相韩兴国，因肺结核严重，转到该院，由于会诊周到，治疗及时，很快就停止了病情发展。
    为答谢朝鲜人民对志愿军的无限爱戴和大力支援，志愿军各个部队很重视和朝鲜各方面的友好往来工作。去年，志愿军曾派出代表团二百四十二个，代表一万一千多名，为朝鲜人民演出和放映电影一千八百五十六场次。在朝鲜人民军建军节时，志愿军司令员杨勇上将亲率二十七个代表团、六个文工团分别到人民军各部慰问，普遍和人民军官兵见了面，人民军同志用最隆重的礼节接待了他们，有的还从大山中找来金达来花献给代表和演员，表示谢意。至于群众性的友好活动，就更为普遍。这种交往活动，内容丰富多彩，情感真挚热烈。志愿军某部三营和人民军某部三营在前沿某地警戒为邻，他们经常协同演习，互相学习，不断写信相互鼓励，互相请吃便饭，有时还派人参加对方人员的婚礼。许多部队在进驻营房之后，还不断派人慰问过去的房东和邻居，有的还把原房东接到部队来过节，一起包饺子，吃喜酒，彼此之间，可以说是情同骨肉，亲如家人。
    在朝鲜战争中和战后艰苦的日子里，我们的志愿军战士，就是这样地忠于祖国和热爱朝鲜人民。尽管时光飞快地过着，尽管他们十分怀念祖国和自己的亲人，但他们日日夜夜以血和汗滋润着朝鲜这个英雄国家的可爱的土地，他们以热爱祖国、热爱和平与人类进步事业的高度热情，和朝鲜人民一起警惕地守卫着“三八线”，并像建设亲爱的祖国一样，帮助英雄的朝鲜人民进行恢复建设。（1957年4月于朝鲜）
