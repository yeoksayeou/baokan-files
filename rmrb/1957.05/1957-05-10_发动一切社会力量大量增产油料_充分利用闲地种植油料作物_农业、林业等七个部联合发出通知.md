Mobilize All Social Forces to Increase Oilseed Production Massively
Fully Utilize Idle Land to Plant Oilseed Crops
Joint Notice Issued by Seven Ministries Including Agriculture and Forestry

This newspaper reports that: The Ministry of Agriculture, the Forestry Department, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Food Industry, issued a joint notice on May 6th stating: In order to alleviate the current tense situation regarding edible vegetable oils and industrial oils, all localities must find ways to increase the production of oilseed crops from multiple perspectives. Fully mobilizing the masses to utilize land around houses, hillsides, wasteland, and the spaces alongside highways, railways, and riverbanks, to plant various herbaceous and woody oilseed crops according to local conditions, is an important way to increase oilseed production.

When utilizing state-owned land alongside highways, railways, and riverbanks to plant oilseed crops, it should be done under the principle of protecting the consolidation of riverbanks and roadbeds and ensuring traffic safety. The relevant departments should guide and mobilize nearby agricultural cooperatives and the masses to plant. As for oilseed crops planted by agricultural cooperatives or the masses on public wasteland, fields, and land beside villages, they can be “self-planted, self-cultivated, and self-harvested.”

The notice stated: The supply of seeds and seedlings for oilseed crops should generally be resolved by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. Those who genuinely lack seeds and seedlings can contact the grain departments (including oil companies) and forestry departments locally with a letter of introduction from the local government, and they will be supplied at a price. If there are difficulties in obtaining seedlings for large-scale afforestation, the method of lending seeds and seedlings can be used, priced at cost, and repaid in installments.

In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in increasing oilseed production, purchasing units at all levels should actively improve purchasing methods, increase the number of purchasing points, provide farmers with the greatest convenience for selling oilseeds, and ensure purchases. At the same time, we should also conscientiously implement a reasonable price policy.

The notice requires relevant leading departments at all levels to seize the season and quickly mobilize social forces such as agricultural cooperatives, schools, organs, organizations, factories, and troops to utilize all available land to carry out oilseed crop planting activities. At the same time, relevant departments at all levels are required to cooperate closely and jointly do a good job in seed and seedling supply, technical guidance, purchasing, and other work, so that oilseed production can be further developed.

    发动一切社会力量大量增产油料
    充分利用闲地种植油料作物
    农业、林业等七个部联合发出通知
    本报讯　农业部、林业部、粮食部、交通部、水利部、教育部、食品工业部，于5月6日发出的联合通知中指出：为了缓和目前食用植物油脂与工业用油的紧张局势，各地必须从多方面想办法，增加油料作物的生产。充分发动群众利用住宅前后、山坡、荒地、公路、铁路、河堤两旁的隙地，因地制宜地种植各种草本、木本油料作物，是增加油料生产的重要途径之一。
    在利用公路、铁路、河堤两岸的国有土地种植油料作物的时候，应在保护河堤与路基巩固和行车安全的原则下，由各有关部门指导和发动附近的农业社和群众种植。至于农业社或群众在公有的荒地、田边、村旁等土地上种植的油料作物，可归他们“自种、自育、自收”。
    通知中说：油料作物的种子、苗木的供应，一般应由农业社自行解决。凡真正缺乏种子、苗木的，可持当地政府介绍信，就地与粮食部门（包括油脂公司）、林业部门接洽，作价供应。成片造林者如种苗有困难，可用贷种贷苗的办法，按成本作价，分期扣还。
    为了鼓励广大农民增产油料的积极性，各级收购单位，应当积极改进收购方式，增设收购点，给农民以出售油料的极大方便，保证收购。同时，还应认真贯彻合理的价格政策。
    通知要求各级有关领导部门，抓紧季节迅速发动农业社、学校、机关、团体、工厂、部队等社会力量，利用一切可能利用的土地，开展种植油料作物活动。同时，要求各级有关部门密切配合，共同作好种子、苗木供应、技术指导、收购等工作，使油料生产进一步地发展。
