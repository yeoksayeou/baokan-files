Equatorial Diameter Length Has New Theory; Cosmic Distances Should Be Modified

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th - TASS reports that Soviet scientists have proven that the Earth's equatorial diameter is 500 meters smaller than previously recognized. This means the Earth is smaller than previously thought, and therefore, all distances between celestial bodies should be adjusted accordingly.

I. Zhongolovich, Deputy Director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in a report to the Soviet Geographical Society that the task of determining the size of the Earth has until now been considered a purely geometric problem. However, the work of Soviet astronomers and surveyors has convincingly demonstrated that this task cannot be solved using geometric methods. It is necessary to use data on the Earth's entire gravitational field.

Therefore, the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences studied all the data on gravity on the Earth's surface. The result of this work made it possible to organize the astronomical and geographical data of Europe, Asia, and North America, and to determine two large arcs, each about 10,000 kilometers long. One arc connects southern Africa and the Arctic Ocean, and the other extends along South America and North America.

Due to the changes in the calculation of the Earth's equatorial diameter, the known distances between celestial bodies must be modified. For example, the distance between the Earth and the Sun has changed by more than 12,000 kilometers accordingly.

New Type of Solar Furnace Can Produce Pure Heat; Up to 3,500 Degrees Celsius

Xinhua News Agency, May 24th - New York News: The United States recently tested a new type of solar furnace. The temperature generated by this furnace after concentrating sunlight is as high as 3,500 degrees Celsius, which is almost two-thirds of the temperature of the Sun's surface. As a result, a sample of heat-resistant material was burned during the test. American scientists believe that this solar furnace is most suitable for high-temperature research because the heat it produces is "pure" heat, and there are no gas by-products caused by containers or fuel that make the thermal energy impure.

This solar furnace includes a large flat mirror (or heliostat). This flat mirror can rotate with the sun and reflect sunlight to a parabolic concave glass mirror with a diameter of about 1.5 meters. This mirror concentrates all the solar heat it receives into a single, scorching spot about one-half centimeter in diameter, creating high temperatures.

    赤道直径长度有新说  宇宙天体距离应修改
    新华社莫斯科24日电　据塔斯社报道，苏联科学家们已经证明，地球赤道的直径比到目前为止所公认的要小五百公尺。这就是说，地球比过去公认的为小，因此，宇宙天体间各项距离都要作相应的变动。
    苏联科学院理论天文学研究所副所长伊·若恩戈洛维奇在苏联地理学会作的一次报告中说，到现在为止测定地球大小的任务一直被认为是纯粹的几何学上的问题。但是苏联的天文学家和测量学家们的劳动令人信服地证实了，这个任务不能用几何学的方法来解决。必须利用关于整个地球重力场的资料。
    因此，苏联科学院理论天文学研究所对所有地球表面的重力的资料进行了研究。这个工作的结果为整理欧洲、亚洲和北美洲的天文地理资料，以及确定两个各长约一万公里的大弧线带来了可能性。一条弧线连接非洲南部和北冰洋，另一条弧线沿着南美洲和北美洲伸展。
    由于对地球赤道直径测算的变动，宇宙天体间已知的距离都要修改了，例如，地球同太阳之间的距离就相应地改变了一万二千多公里。
    新型太阳炉能生纯热  高达摄氏三千五百度
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：美国最近试验了一种新型太阳炉，这座炉集中太阳光后产生出来的温度高达摄氏三千五百度，几乎等于太阳表面热度的三分之二。因而在试验中，竟把一种抗热物质的样品烧毁了。美国科学家认为这种太阳炉最适宜于做高温研究，因为它所产生的热是“纯”热，没有因为容器或燃料引起的气体副产品使热能不纯的毛病。
    这种太阳炉包括一座很大的平面镜（或称追日镜）。这种平面镜能够跟着太阳旋转，把太阳光反射给一个直径约一点五公尺的抛物线形的凹面玻璃镜。这面镜子把它上面所收到的全部太阳光热集中为单一的一个直径约二分之一公分的炽热的光点上，造成高温。
