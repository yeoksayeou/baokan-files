Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 30th - According to a broadcast by the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, Nan Ri, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement today opposing the United States' attempt to bring new types of weapons into South Korea to strengthen the US military and South Korean army stationed there.

The statement said that after the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides strictly abided by the armistice agreement, guaranteed the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and made sincere efforts to quickly and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. However, the US side not only grossly violated the armistice agreement by illegally importing large quantities of weapons and equipment to arm the South Korean army, which had been expanded after the armistice, but also colluded with the South Korean authorities to force the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to unilaterally cease its functions of supervising the armistice in South Korea in order to import more weapons.

The statement said that in particular, US Secretary of State Dulles, Secretary of Defense Wilson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford and other officials have recently openly clamored for the introduction of new types of weapons into South Korea and the reorganization of the US military and South Korean army stationed in South Korea into atomic units. "These statements expose the conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc to undermine the armistice agreement, transport new types of weapons into South Korea, encourage the aggressive behavior of the South Korean ruling clique, and perpetuate the US military's occupation of South Korea."

The statement pointed out that in South Korea, the anti-American sentiment of the people opposing the US military's occupation and atrocities has also been aroused, and the United States and the Rhee Syngman clique are attempting to strengthen their military force to suppress the just struggle of the Korean people.

The statement said, "This conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc cannot scare the Korean people, nor can it frustrate the firm will of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland."

The statement emphasized, "The Korean people resolutely oppose the US aggressive bloc's conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice agreement and transport new types of weapons into South Korea to turn South Korea into an atomic war base for aggression. The Korean people demand that, for the peaceful reunification of Korea and the easing of tensions in the Far East, every clause of the Korean armistice agreement must be strictly observed, and practical measures must be taken to transform the armistice into a lasting peace."

The statement concluded, "If the US government and the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side disregard this practical demand of the Korean people and engage in serious actions to undermine the Korean armistice agreement, then they shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom."

    南日外务相发表声明
    严斥美国企图运新武器到南朝鲜
    美国政府应对破坏停战协定的一切后果负全部责任
    新华社平壤30日电　据朝鲜中央广播电台广播，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天发表声明，反对美国企图把新型武器运入南朝鲜以加强驻在南朝鲜的美军和南朝鲜军队。
    声明说，朝鲜停战后，朝中方面严守停战协定，保证中立国监察委员会的活动，并且为了迅速和平解决朝鲜问题而作了真诚的努力。但是，美方不仅粗暴地违反停战协定，非法运入大量的武器和装备，武装了停战后扩充起来的南朝鲜军队，并且为了运进更多的武器，同南朝鲜当局相勾结，迫使中立国监察委员会片面地停止了在南朝鲜监督停战的职能。
    声明说，特别是美国国务卿杜勒斯、国防部长威尔逊、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福等官方人士最近公开叫嚣：要把新型武器运入南朝鲜，把驻在南朝鲜的美军和南朝鲜军队改编为原子部队。“这些声明暴露了美国侵略集团要破坏停战协定，把新型武器运入南朝鲜，助长南朝鲜统治集团的侵略行为，把美军对南朝鲜的占领永久化的阴谋。”
    声明指出，在南朝鲜，人民的反对美军占领和暴行的反美情绪也被激发起来了，美国和李承晚集团企图加强武力来镇压朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    声明说，“美国侵略集团的这个阴谋吓不倒朝鲜人民，挫折不了朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的坚定意志。”
    声明强调说，“朝鲜人民坚决反对美国侵略集团破坏朝鲜停战协定，把新型武器运入南朝鲜来把南朝鲜变为进行侵略的原子战争基地的阴谋。朝鲜人民要求，为了朝鲜的和平统一和缓和远东紧张局势，必须严格遵守朝鲜停战协定的每项条款，必须采取实际的措施把停战转变为持久和平。”
    声明最后说，“如果美国政府和其他联合国军方面的各国政府无视朝鲜人民的这个切实的要求，竟然进行破坏朝鲜停战协定的严重行动的话，那么它们就要对因此发生的一切后果负全部责任。”
