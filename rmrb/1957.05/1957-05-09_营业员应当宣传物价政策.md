    Sales Staff Should Publicize Price Policies

    After the price increases of some commodities like wool fabrics and pork in Shanghai, some people thought that the Party's policy of stabilizing prices had changed. They withdrew their savings from the bank and rushed to the market to buy commodities that they did not need or were not urgently needed. According to statistics from five woolen yarn stores in Huangpu District, Shanghai, the turnover generally increased by about one time in the days after the price adjustment of wool fabrics. Why did the masses have such doubts? The most important problem is insufficient publicity.

    Consumers first raise their concerns about price issues with commercial staff. Commercial staff should actively publicize the Party's policies, and should be both sales staff and propagandists. Ma Yu

    营业员应当宣传物价政策
    在上海，呢绒、猪肉等部分商品涨价以后，有些人认为党的稳定物价的方针变了，把原来存在银行里的款取出来，到市场上去抢购自己所不需要的或不急需的商品。据上海市黄浦区五个绒线商店的统计，在呢绒调价后的几天内，营业额均普遍上升一倍左右。群众为什么产生这种疑虑呢？最主要的问题就是宣传不够。
    消费者对物价问题的反映，首先在商业工作人员面前提出来。商业工作人员应该积极宣传党的政策，要做到既是营业员，又是宣传员。　马羽
