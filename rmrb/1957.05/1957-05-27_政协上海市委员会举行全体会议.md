Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 26th: The Fourth Plenary Session of the First CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee closed on the 25th. Before the close of the meeting, Ke Qingshi, Chairman of the Standing Committee, called on everyone to further unite on the basis of past unity and on the basis of exposing and correctly handling contradictions among the people, and strive for greater victories in the cause of building socialism.

The plenary session of the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee was opened on the 22nd after more than half a month of preparatory meetings. The members and delegates attending the meeting were divided into twenty-seven groups to conduct multiple discussions, exposing the various aspects of the contradictions among the people in Shanghai, and put forward thousands of opinions and suggestions for resolving contradictions. The preparatory meeting continued until everyone felt that they had finished speaking their minds.

During the four days of the formal meeting, more than 300 CPPCC members and delegates delivered speeches or written statements at the general meeting. In addition to continuing to raise criticisms on various aspects, everyone also put forward many suggestions for resolving contradictions. Some leaders of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee also reported at the meeting on measures they were preparing to implement to improve work. Xu Pingyu, Director of the Cultural Bureau, said: The Cultural Bureau will change the past policy of "taking over" art troupes and the bureaucratic leadership methods, based on the special nature of art troupes; old state-owned troupes will consider changing from the current system of ownership by the whole people to collective ownership. Xin Yuanxi, Deputy Director of the Finance, Grain and Trade Office, reported on new measures to improve market management and stabilize prices. He said that in order to fundamentally solve the supply of non-staple foods in Shanghai, Shanghai will cooperate with neighboring provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang to establish a series of non-staple food production bases.

This meeting also heard a report by Vice Mayor Song Jiwen on the city's campaign to increase production and practice thrift. In the discussion, everyone believed that the increase in production and thrift should prevent the tendency to reduce quality and reduce the welfare of workers. The meeting finally passed a resolution. The resolution stated: Increasing production and practicing thrift is a regular political task, and in the future, on the existing basis, we should continue to vigorously carry out increasing production and practicing thrift, and establish a style of hard work and thrift in building the country.

This meeting launched a heated debate on some issues. The most heated debate was on the joint speech by Lu Mang and other seventeen delegates entitled "Fill the 'Moat' and Flatten the 'Bridgehead'". Lu Mang and others said that in addition to the "walls" and "gulfs" between the Party and the masses, there are also "moats" and "bridgeheads," "that is, a few bureaucratic people who call themselves 'progressive' and are considered to have a 'bridging role'. They repackaged the official secrets and worldly wisdom brought from the old society and applied them to the new society." They also said: These bureaucrats have spent eight years in vain, doing nothing for the country or the people, and are always content to be "meal-attending secretaries," eating, sleeping, and accomplishing nothing. They disagreed with the view that the wall between the Party and the masses was built by both sides, believing that the wall was built by some Party members and bureaucratic people among non-Party members, and had nothing to do with others.

Before and after Lu Mang's speech, five people declared their withdrawal from this joint speech. At that time, two CPPCC members also wrote notes to the chairman stating that they firmly opposed Lu Mang's speech, believing that this speech negated the positive role of democratic figures in the past eight years and was an insult to democratic figures. In subsequent group and plenary speeches, many people expressed their disagreement with Lu Mang's views, believing that criticism should not be replaced by scolding. Some people believed that this joint speech was somewhat rash, but it could also be taken as a warning. The correct parts of the speech could be accepted, and the wrong parts could be criticized.

    政协上海市委员会举行全体会议
    会议对鲁莽等十七位列席代表填满“护城河”、削平“桥头堡”的联合发言展开热烈争论
    新华社上海26日电　政协上海市委员会一届四次全体会议在25日闭幕。常务委员会主席柯庆施在会议闭幕前，号召大家在过去团结的基础上，在揭露和正确处理人民内部矛盾的基础上，进一步团结起来，争取在建设社会主义的事业中取得更大的胜利。
    政协上海市委员会的这一次全体会议，是经过了半个多月的预备会议以后，在22日开幕的。委员们和列席代表在预备会上分成二十七个小组进行了多次的讨论，揭露了上海所存在的各个方面的人民内部矛盾，提出了几千条意见和解决矛盾的建议。预备会一直开到大家认为心里的话已经讲完时方才结束。
    在正式会议的四天中，有三百多位政协委员和列席代表作了大会发言或书面发言。大家除了继续提出对各个方面的批评以外，还提出了许多解决矛盾的建议。上海市人民委员会的一些负责人也在会上报告了准备实行的改进工作的措施。文化局局长徐平羽说：文化局将根据艺术团体的特殊性质，改变过去对艺术团体的“包下来”政策和机关化的领导方法，老国营剧团将考虑从现在的全民所有制改为集体所有制。财粮贸办公室副主任忻元锡报告了改进市场管理和稳定物价方面的新措施，他说为了根本解决上海副食品的供应问题，上海将与江苏、浙江等邻近的省分合作，建立一系列的副食品生产基地。
    这一次会议还听取了副市长宋季文关于全市增产节约运动情况的报告。在讨论中，大家认为增产节约应当防止降低质量和降低工人生活福利的偏向。会议最后通过了一项决议。决议中说：增产节约是一项经常性的政治任务，今后应该在已有的基础上，继续大力开展增产节约，树立艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的作风。
    这一次会议对有些问题展开了热烈的争论。其中争论得最热烈的是对鲁莽等十七位列席代表的题为“填满‘护城河’，削平‘桥头堡’”的联合发言。鲁莽等说，在党群间的“城墙”和“鸿沟”之外，还有“护城河”和“桥头堡”，“那就是少数自命‘前进’，也算负有‘桥梁作用’的官僚主义者。他们把旧社会带来的一套做官秘诀，人情世故，换个封面，应用到新社会。”他们还说：这批官僚主义者八年虚度，于国于人无补，始终甘于做个“伴食中书”，吃饭睡觉，一无建树。他们不同意党群之间的墙是双方筑成的看法，认为墙是部分党员和非党人士中的官僚主义者筑成的，与旁人无关。
    在鲁莽发言的前后，有五个人声明退出这个联合发言。当时还有两位政协委员写条子向主席声明，他们坚决反对鲁莽等的发言，认为这个发言否定了八年来民主人士的积极作用，是对民主人士的侮辱。在以后的小组和大会发言中，许多人表示不能同意鲁莽等的观点，认为不能用漫骂来代替批评，有的人认为这个联合发言是鲁莽了一些，但也可以引以为戒，发言中对的地方可以接受，错误之处可以进行批判。
