During this rectification campaign, we oppose three isms.
Since all three isms should be opposed, it's clear that none are better than others.
But strangely, the leading comrades in some units have different ideas. They have preferences and taboos regarding the three isms, treating them differently.
If anyone wants to criticize dogmatism, welcome! If you don't want to say anything, I'll inspire you; before you even open your mouth, I'll give a demonstration. We must ensure that everyone speaks enthusiastically and expresses themselves thoroughly. We guarantee "those who speak are not guilty," and the symposium can end happily.
If anyone wants to criticize bureaucracy, we won't object either. Whatever you want to say, we won't stop you from saying it; however much you say, we'll listen. Wear a solemn face, prevent delving too deeply, and strive to keep it within bounds.
If anyone wants to criticize sectarianism, it means you want to "tear down walls," to "dig" at my "foundations," which is unacceptable. Therefore, we must use all kinds of methods to shut your mouth.
There is evidence:
The Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Writers Association held a symposium earlier this month with the aim of exposing problems and "tearing down walls." Unfortunately, "even in the symposium, sectarianism still lingered like a ghost."
Here's another example:
A certain Shanghai publishing house invited members of democratic parties within the company to hold a symposium to expose internal contradictions. At the meeting, the Party member in charge emphasized one sentence: "We don't have sectarianism here."
The two examples each have subtle differences, but their essence is the same.
One is that it's not convenient to adopt a "Mount Tai crushing" stance today. But it still appears faintly, letting you know, "I'm here, you have to be careful, don't talk nonsense." This will naturally scare off the timid, leaving them speechless; then you can remain motionless like a mountain.
The other is, I've already drawn the conclusion, so what else can you say? If you're not sensible and insist on speaking, it's just "shooting at a target that isn't there"; because "we don't have sectarianism here," what are you ranting about?
Protecting deep trenches and high ramparts, even with "sincere welcome" for everyone to criticize dogmatism and not suppressing everyone's criticism of bureaucracy, it's difficult to achieve the real goal. If others have concerns, how can they fully express their heartfelt words? The result is still sighing at the trenches and feeling blocked by the ramparts. Forcing a few words is like scratching an itch through boots, which is useless.
In fact, deep trenches and high ramparts cannot be protected. Didn't the Shanghai branch of the Writers Association finally gradually dismantle and fill in the "walls within walls" and "trenches outside walls" under "internal and external attacks"?

    幽灵徘徊不去
    黄立文
    这次整风，反对三个主义。
    既然三个主义都应反对，可见并无好坏之分。
    但奇怪的是，有些单位的领导同志却别有想法。他们对于三个主义有偏爱、有禁忌，实行分别对待。
    谁要批评教条主义，欢迎！你还不想说什么，我来启发；你还没有开口，我先示范。务求大家热烈发言，淋漓尽致。保证“言者无罪”，座谈会也能尽欢而散。
    谁要批评官僚主义，也不反对。你要说什么，不阻止你说什么；你说多少，我听多少。满脸严肃，谨防深入，务求适可而止。
    谁要批评宗派主义，表示你想“拆墙”了，要“挖”我的“墙脚”，这还了得。于是，非用各种方法把你的嘴一家伙堵住不可。
    有例为证：
    中国作家协会广州分会本月初举行座谈会，目的为了揭露问题，为了“拆墙”。但不幸“即使在座谈会中，宗派主义仍旧像一个幽灵似的在徘徊”。
    还有一个例子：
    上海某出版社邀请社内民主党派成员举行座谈会，揭露内部矛盾。在会上，党员负责干部强调的是这么一句话：“我们这里没有宗派主义。”
    两个例子，各有巧妙不同，其揆一也。
    一种是，今天不便于采取“泰山压顶”之势了。但仍然若隐若现，让你知道“我在这里，你得当心点，不要胡说八道”。这样，胆小的自然就被吓退了，无话可说了；自己就可以像一座山一样，一动也不动。
    另一种是，我把结论都做好了，你还有什么话好说？如果你不识相，一定要说，也不过是“无的放矢”；因为“我们这里没有宗派主义”，你还瞎嚷嚷干甚么？
    保住深沟高垒，即便“竭诚欢迎”大家批评教条主义和并不压制大家批评官僚主义，也是很难达到真正的目的。别人有了顾虑，怎能尽倾肺腑之言，结果还不是望沟兴叹，望垒心塞。勉强说几句，形同隔靴搔痒，无济于事。
    其实，深沟高垒是保不住的。作家协会上海分会不是终于在“内外夹攻”之下，逐渐拆除和填平“墙内之墙”和“墙外之沟”么？
