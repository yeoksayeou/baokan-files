Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Tokyo: An anti-American wave is rising in Japan. The Japan Socialist Party held a leadership meeting today and decided to work with labor unions, farmer groups, students, cultural circles, women's groups, and others to hold a "National Convention to Make Demands on the United States" in Tokyo on June 15th.

At this national convention, resolutions will be made regarding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement, the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, opposition to the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, opposition to the stationing of atomic forces in Japan, promotion of the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and so on.

Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, said today that the Socialist Party will demand that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi implement the resolutions passed by this national convention when he visits the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Tokyo: The All Japan Aviation Enterprises Union requested the Japanese Procurement Agency on May 28th to demand that the U.S. Air Force completely return Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) to Japan.

According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the All Japan Aviation Enterprises Union, led by JAL President Seijiro Yanagida, said that the United States still occupies more than 60% of Haneda Airport. It was originally stipulated that all facilities currently in American hands should have been returned to Japan in 1952.

According to Kyodo News, the U.S. side stated that the U.S. military can only withdraw from Haneda Airport if the expansion of U.S. military bases such as Tachikawa can be realized. The Japanese side demanded that these two issues be resolved completely separately.

Kyodo News said that the All Japan Aviation Enterprises Union will submit a request to the U.S. representative of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee within a day or two to reclaim the Haneda Airport facilities.

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: TASS, Tokyo, May 28th: According to "Children's Protection," the Second National Representative Conference for Protecting Children Living in the U.S. Military Base Area was recently held in Sunagawa, where a huge U.S. Air Force base is located. Representatives of Japanese educators, scientists, and mothers attended the meeting.

In their speeches, the conference participants pointed out the extremely harmful effects of the U.S. military base on the lives of children in neighboring areas and exchanged views on measures to combat these effects.

Ms. Sugama, Secretary of the Japan Children's Protection Association, told a TASS reporter that this problem arises not only because the constant roar of U.S. bombers taking off hinders students' normal learning, but also because the corruption and depravity of American soldiers corrupt the moral character of the growing generation. Sugama added that Japanese children are also subjected to this corrosive influence by American films that are full of shootings, murders, and rapes, which are massively and virtually unrestricted imported into Japan by Americans.

    日本人民反美浪潮方兴未艾
    社会党发起召开国民大会向美国提要求
    航空事业联合会要求美军交还羽田机场
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天举行领导干部会议，决定要同工会、农民团体、学生、文化界、妇女等团体一起在6月15日在东京举行“向美国提出要求国民大会”。
    在这个国民大会上，将做出关于废除日美安全条约和行政协定的决议，关于冲绳岛和小笠原群岛归还日本的决议，关于反对把核武器运进日本的决议，关于反对原子部队驻扎在日本的决议，关于促进恢复日中邦交的决议，等等。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天说，社会党将要求日本首相岸信介在访问美国的时候，实现这个国民大会所通过的决议。
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：全日本航空事业联合会5月28日请求日本调达厅要求美国空军把东京国际航空港羽田机场完全归还日本。
    据“读卖新闻”报道，由日本航空公司总经理柳田诚二郎领导的全日本航空事业联合会说，美国现在还占据着羽田机场的60％以上。原来规定现在在美国手里的一切设施在1952年就应该归还日本。
    据共同社报道，美方表示，除非能够实现扩充立川等美军基地，美军才能撤出羽田机场。日本方面要求把这两个问题完全分开来解决。
    共同社说，全日本航空事业联合会将在一两天内向日美联合委员会的美方代表提出收回羽田机场设施的要求。
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社东京28日讯：据“保卫儿童报”报道，在建有美国巨大空军基地的砂川，最近举行了第二次保卫居住在美军基地地区儿童的全国代表会议。参加会议的有日本教育家、科学家和母亲的代表。
    会议参加者在发言中指出了美军基地对邻近地区的儿童生活所起的极为有害的影响，并且就同这些影响进行斗争的措施，交换了意见。
    据日本保卫儿童会书记须贺间夫人对塔斯社记者说，所以发生这个问题，不仅是由于不断起飞的美国轰炸机的轰隆喧嚣，妨碍了学生的正常学习，而且还由于美国士兵的腐化堕落，败坏了成长中一代的道德品质。须贺间补充说，使日本儿童蒙受这种腐蚀影响的还有那些故事中少不了枪击、谋杀、强奸的美国影片，这些影片由美国人大量地、事实上是毫无限制地源源输入日本。
