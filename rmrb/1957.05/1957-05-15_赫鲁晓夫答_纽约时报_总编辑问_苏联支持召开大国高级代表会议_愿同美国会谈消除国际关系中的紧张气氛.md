Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: According to TASS, Moscow, Nikolai Khrushchev told Turner Catledge, editor-in-chief of the American "New York Times," that the Soviet government supports the proposal to convene a high-level meeting of major powers, believing that a meeting of leaders of major powers would be beneficial to easing international tensions.

He also said that the international tension issue ultimately boils down to the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States. Soviet leaders believe that as long as the Soviet Union can reach an agreement with the United States, it will not be difficult to reach agreements with Britain, West Germany, France, and other countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union hopes to hold talks with the United States.

Khrushchev met with Catledge, who was visiting the Soviet Union at the time, on May 10th. The American journalist asked Khrushchev, "Do you support the proposal to convene a high-level meeting of major powers in the near future?" Khrushchev replied that we have stated more than once, and still believe, that a meeting of leaders of major powers would be beneficial. However, full preparation must be made for the main issues to be exchanged at the meeting. The first and most important issue to be discussed at such a meeting is the issue of eliminating tensions in relations between countries, especially between major powers, and the second issue is the issue of guaranteeing European security.

Khrushchev pointed out that resolving the issue of European security would eliminate military blocs and establish a normal state of affairs in Europe. Perhaps, it would be best to establish a specialized institution when an agreement on a European security system is reached, so that the participating countries in the European security system, including the United States, can exchange views in this institution and prevent relations between countries from becoming tense. If there is a necessary degree of trust between countries, then it is not necessarily necessary to establish a specialized institution, and the issue can be taken to the United Nations for discussion.

Khrushchev said that if the issue of international tension is stated more precisely, then it is clear that this issue ultimately boils down to the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States. Because the Soviet Union and the United States are the most powerful countries in terms of industry and the strongest in terms of military strength, and both countries possess atomic and hydrogen weapons as well as powerful conventional armaments. They are engaged in the most intense debates on the international stage. Therefore, the question is whether the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States will develop on a friendly basis in the future, or whether the tense relationship between the two countries will continue.

Khrushchev said that our ideological differences will always exist. However, this should not prevent us from living together in harmony as good neighbors. This is one path.

The other path is to continue accumulating weapons. In this regard, it should be considered that with the existence of atomic and hydrogen weapons, with rocket technology equipment and intercontinental missiles, it is inevitable that such a situation will occur: due to some serious error or accidental event, a war may break out that will bring endless disasters not only to the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also to the people of the world. Therefore, we hope to negotiate with the United States. He said that there are no issues that cannot be negotiated between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, if certain leaders in the United States put forward some preconditions to us, such as what U.S. Secretary of State Dulles likes to do, then we cannot agree.

Catledge asked Khrushchev if he believes that the United Nations is an important international tool in resolving international issues.

Khrushchev said, of course, the United Nations should be regarded as a useful tool. But, it would be beneficial to society if I said that the current managers of the United Nations suppress incorrect false information and do not publish it.

Catledge also asked: Are there theoretical and ideological conflicts in some socialist countries on the issue of, for example, Poland obtaining economic assistance from capitalist countries (such as the United States)?

Khrushchev said that there have never been such theoretical rules in the past or present. If it is beneficial to us from an economic point of view, then the Soviet Union itself also hopes to obtain from the United States some things that we need in the economic field. However, it should be considered that the inherent nature of capitalism makes it impossible to assist any country without pursuing its own selfish interests. Therefore, any socialist country or other country should cautiously accept assistance from capitalist countries to avoid losing its independence.

Catledge asked: "Last year, the 'New York Times' published the full text of your speech at the 20th Party Congress. In that speech, you criticized the excesses of the Stalin era. Are there any major omissions or distortions in the full text of your speech published in Western countries?" He also asked: What is Stalin's historical position in the Soviet Union?

Khrushchev said that I heard that something fabricated by American intelligence agencies was published in the United States, claiming it was my report at the 20th Party Congress. Allen Dulles' publishing house has no prestige in the Soviet Union, and I am not interested in reading Allen Dulles' works.

Khrushchev continued, Stalin occupies a very important position in Soviet history. Although he made great mistakes, he was a loyal Marxist-Leninist and a loyal and unwavering revolutionary. Although Stalin made many mistakes in the later stages of his work, he did many beneficial things for our country, our party, and the entire international workers' movement. Our party and the Soviet people will remember him and give him the evaluation he deserves.

Catledge asked Khrushchev if he believes that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the highest authority in interpreting Marxist-Leninist theory.

Khrushchev said that no person or political party can claim the privilege of interpreting Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Marxism-Leninism is a developing science, and every Communist Party can contribute to the development of this science. However, because Marxism-Leninism is gaining increasing prestige among the working people of all countries, some sham communists who try to put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism have also emerged. As the influence of socialist countries on the working people of all countries increases, these sham communists will obviously increase in the future, because it is fashionable to include oneself among the believers of Marxist-Leninist theory. Therefore, our party needs to seriously deal with sham communists, expose them, and not allow them to tarnish Marxist-Leninist theory. He also said that we are very fond of following Marxist-Leninist principles and do not allow any distortion of Marxist-Leninist theory. We will always hope to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory.

Regarding the question of "At present, is the possibility of defending peace greater or the possibility of war greater?" Khrushchev replied that it is difficult to say whether the balance is tilted towards war or peace. The issue of war and peace depends on many circumstances, and this issue depends not only on the Soviet Union, but also on other countries. As for the Soviet Union, it has always done everything possible in the past and present, not only to postpone the war, but also to ensure that the war will never happen. However, as I said, this depends not only on us, but also on other countries, especially the United States.

Khrushchev pointed out that the ideas of those who assert that the Soviet Union's reorganization of industrial management agencies is for some military purpose are incorrect. He said that this reorganization is not at all related to military purposes. War is irrelevant here. The purpose of improving the management agencies of industry and construction is to improve our leadership over the national economy. The measures we are implementing will provide us with more possibilities to enable the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States faster in terms of per capita product production.

Regarding whether the current Near East situation will cause a major conflict, Khrushchev said that this question is difficult to answer, because it is not the Soviet army stationed in the Near East, but the American fleet commanded by a bragging and boastful admiral. It can only be said that deploying the U.S. Sixth Fleet to the eastern Mediterranean is not a smart plan. If this policy continues, anything could happen, but the Americans themselves must consider this issue first. Interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is foolish.

Khrushchev said that the people of the Middle East and Near East countries may not be willing to put on the shackles of American colonialism after getting rid of the shackles of British colonialism, because bearing American shackles is no easier than British shackles. The people will never agree to the colonial system.

Catledge asked Khrushchev if he would like to visit the United States? Does he think it would be beneficial if he and Eisenhower met as leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Republican Party of the United States? Khrushchev said that he hopes to visit the United States, but his position makes it impossible for him to visit the United States as a tourist. If he and Eisenhower met as leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Republican Party of the United States, this might be beneficial, and of course I agree to such a meeting.

    赫鲁晓夫答“纽约时报”总编辑问
    苏联支持召开大国高级代表会议
    愿同美国会谈消除国际关系中的紧张气氛
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫对美国“纽约时报”总编辑卡特勒奇说，苏联政府支持召开大国高级代表会议的主张，认为大国政府领导人会晤对缓和国际紧张局势是有好处的。
    他又说，国际紧张局势问题归根结底就是苏联和美国之间的关系问题。苏联领导人认为，苏联只要能同美国达成协议，就不难同英国、西德、法国及其他国家达成协议。因此，苏联希望能同美国进行会谈。
    赫鲁晓夫在5月10日接见了当时正在苏联访问的卡特勒奇。这位美国记者问赫鲁晓夫“是否支持在最近召开大国高级代表会议的主张？”赫鲁晓夫回答说，我们已经不止一次地声明，而且现在仍然认为，大国政府领导人会晤是有好处的。但是，必须对会上将要交换意见的主要问题进行充分的准备。在这种会议上需要讨论的第一个最主要的问题是消除国与国之间、首先是大国相互关系中的紧张气氛的问题，第二个问题是保障欧洲安全的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，解决了欧洲安全问题，就能消灭军事集团和建立欧洲的正常状态。也许，最好是在达成关于欧洲安全体系的协议时建立某种专门的机构，使包括美国在内的欧洲安全体系的参加国可以在这个机构里互相交换意见，防止各国关系趋于紧张。如果各国间有了必要程度的信任，那么就不一定必须建立专门的机构，问题就可以拿到联合国去讨论了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果把国际紧张局势这件事说得确切一点，那么，显然这件事归根结底就是苏美两国之间的关系问题。因为，苏联和美国在工业方面是最雄厚、在军事方面是最强盛的大国，同时两国都拥有原子武器和氢武器以及雄厚的常规军备。在国际舞台上，它们之间进行着最激烈的论战。因此，问题在于，苏美两国关系今后在友好的基础上发展呢，还是两国之间的紧张关系继续下去。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们之间的观念形态上的分歧将永远存在。但是，这应当不致于妨碍我们睦邻相处。这是一条道路。
    另外一条道路是继续积累武器。在这方面应当考虑到，有原子武器和氢武器的存在，有火箭技术设备和洲际导弹的存在，就难免会发生这样一种情况：由于某种后果严重的错误或偶发事件，可能爆发不仅会给苏美两国人民、而且会给全世界人民带来无穷灾难的战争。因此，我们希望同美国进行谈判。他说，在苏美两国之间没有不可以协商的问题。但是，如果美国某些领导人向我们提出某种先决条件，例如像美国国务卿杜勒斯先生所喜欢做的那样，那么我们是不能同意的。
    卡特勒奇问赫鲁晓夫，他是否认为在解决国际问题时，联合国是一个重要的国际工具？
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，应当把联合国当作一个有益的工具。但是，如果我说联合国目前主管人员压住不正确的假消息，不发表它们，这对社会是有益的。
    卡特勒奇还问道：在例如波兰从资本主义国家（比如美国）取得经济援助的问题上，一些社会主义国家是否存在着理论上和思想上的抵触？
    赫鲁晓夫说，过去和现在都没有存在过这样的理论上的规则。如果从经济角度上来看对我们有益的话，就是苏联自己也希望从美国得到一些我们经济方面所需要的东西。但是，应该考虑到资本主义的固有的本性是不可能去援助任何一个国家而不追求自己自私自利的目的的。因此，任何社会主义国家或别的国家都应该慎重地去接受资本主义国家的援助，以免丧失自己的独立。
    卡特勒奇发问：“去年‘纽约时报’发表了您在第二十次党代表大会上的讲话全文。在那篇讲话中批评了斯大林时期的过火行为。在西方国家所发表的您的讲话全文中是否有什么重大的疏忽或者曲解？”他又问：斯大林在苏联的历史地位如何？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我听说，在美国曾发表过美国谍报机关制造出来的一篇东西，把它说成是我在第二十次党代表大会上作的报告。艾伦·杜勒斯的出版机构在苏联没有威信，我没有兴趣拜读艾伦·杜勒斯的大作。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，斯大林在苏联历史上占有很重要的地位。尽管他曾经犯过很大的错误，但是他是一位忠实的马克思列宁主义者，是一位忠实而坚定不移的革命者。斯大林虽然在他的工作的后期犯了很多错误，可是他为我们国家、我们党和整个国际工人运动做了很多有益的事情。我们党和苏联人民会怀念他，会给他以应有的评价。
    卡特勒奇问赫鲁晓夫，他是否认为苏联共产党在阐释马克思列宁主义理论方面是最高的权威？
    赫鲁晓夫说，无论任何人和任何政党都不能占有阐释马克思列宁主义学说的特权。马克思列宁主义是一门发展中的科学，每个共产党都可以对发展这门科学作出贡献。但是，由于马克思列宁主义在各国劳动人民当中获得越来越高的威信，也出现了一些力图披上马克思列宁主义外衣的冒牌共产主义者。随着社会主义国家对各国劳动人民的影响越来越大，今后这种冒牌共产主义者显然会越来越多，因为把自己列入马克思列宁主义理论信徒之列是件时髦的事。因此，我们的党需要严肃对付冒牌共产主义者，揭穿他们，不让他们沾污马克思列宁主义理论。他又说，我们对遵循马克思列宁主义原则是非常偏爱的，并且不容许对马克思列宁主义理论有任何歪曲。我们永远希望保持马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁。
    关于“目前，是保卫和平的可能性大还是发生战争的可能性大”这个问题，赫鲁晓夫回答说，很难说天平是朝向战争方面还是和平方面。战争和和平的问题取决于许多情况，这个问题不仅取决于苏联，而且也取决于其他国家。至于苏联，它过去和现在始终竭尽一切努力，不仅是使战争推迟，而且使战争根本不会发生。但是，正像我所说的，这不仅取决于我们，而且也取决于其他国家，首先是取决于美国。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，那些断言苏联改组工业管理机构是为了某种军事目的的人的想法是不正确的。他说，这次改组根本同军事目的联系不起来。战争在这里是不相干的事。改进工业和建设的管理机构的目的，是改进我们对国民经济的领导。我们所推行的措施将为我们提供更多的可能性，使苏联能更快地在按人口平均产品生产方面赶上美国。
    关于目前近东局势是否会造成大的冲突的问题，赫鲁晓夫说，这个问题很难回答，因为驻扎在近东的并不是苏联军队，而是由一位光说大话、自吹自擂的海军上将所指挥的美国舰队。只能够说，向地中海东部出动美国第六舰队是一个不聪明的打算。如果这个政策继续下去，什么都可能发生，可是这个问题首先要让美国人自己去考虑。干涉其他国家内政是愚蠢的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，中近东国家的人民未必就心甘情愿地在摆脱英国殖民主义桎梏之后又给自己套上美国殖民主义的桎梏，因为背上美国桎梏并不比英国桎梏轻松。人民决不会同意殖民主义制度。
    卡特勒奇问赫鲁晓夫，他是否想访问美国？他是否认为，他和艾森豪威尔各以苏联共产党和美国共和党领导人的身份会晤是有益处的？赫鲁晓夫说，他希望访问美国，但是，他所处的地位，使他不能作为旅行者访问美国。如果他和艾森豪威尔各以苏联共产党和美国共和党领导人的身份会晤，这可能是有益的，我当然同意这样的会晤。
