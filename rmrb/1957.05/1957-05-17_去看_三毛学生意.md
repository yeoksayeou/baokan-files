Watching "Sanmao's Business Venture" by Li Jianwu

In the unlikely event that you go to Shanghai to enjoy the local scenery, take my advice and, in your spare time, consider seeing the Shanghai People's Acrobatic Troupe's "Sanmao's Business Venture." You might have to queue several times to get a ticket. But for a bureaucrat like you, queuing a few times, and then, as if winning the lottery, entering a social corner like the "Hongkou Theater" and laughing heartily with the "low-class" audience on hard benches, you'll find it more effective than taking a vacation.

The curtain rises, and on the shallow stage appears a small dock. Passengers disembark and go ashore, and after going ashore, each goes their own way. You see two rickshaw pullers from the old days fighting over business, fighting to the point of stubbornly doing business at a loss, and from that moment on, you'll laugh all the way until you leave.

But in some parts, you'll want to cry for a long time. You want to cry but can't, and that feeling is really uncomfortable. The most unbearable moment is when you're about to cry, but you also want to laugh. The two "contradict," so you shed tears while your mouth is open in a wide grin, and your tongue tastes salty (not salt water, but tear water), and you don't know what's going on. Fortunately, the audience isn't looking at themselves, or they might mistakenly think that Comrade Wen Binbin's facial expression as Sanmao has transferred to their own face.

Comrade Wen Binbin is good in every way, except that his gold teeth are a flaw. If you had known you would be playing the suffering character Sanmao today, you would have regretted not having your dentures made of gold.

The long scene with you and Comrade Liu Xiasheng, who plays the barber, and Comrade Xia Jing, who plays the barber's wife, is something I will never forget. Who has ever seen a barber beating his apprentice? Go and appreciate the "superb" scene of Sanmao leaning his butt sideways on the swivel chair waiting to be beaten. That's something even the comedy master Molière couldn't have imagined.

Sometimes the actors make the play vulgar, but that's to be expected. The "high society" never had a place for them. It's not surprising that they add some local tunes to the play. Chekhov loved to watch "Vaudeville" (a kind of wild and naturally grown French farce), which was like this. Moreover, this kind of slapstick comedy grew up in the Shanghai citizen circle.

It is said that the predecessor of slapstick comedy was civilized drama, and the predecessor of civilized drama was early spoken drama. I'm not too clear about this tradition. I just heard (so I'm not responsible) that these slapstick comedy troupes recently held a performance in Shanghai, and after a Soviet theater expert watched it, he was as naive as I usually am and shouted loudly, "So your good spoken drama actors are all here!"

One fact is that another slapstick comedy troupe adapted Molière's "Tartuffe" into the Shanghai-style "Living Buddha," which has been performed continuously in Shanghai for two or three years and will continue to be performed. I told this to the famous French stage actor Philippe, who was both happy and surprised, and blamed Loy (a French writer who had been to China) for writing a big book introducing the new China, but not mentioning this "big" event that would excite the French.

I'm digressing. You can't see all the slapstick comedy in Shanghai (some actors are still stuck in self-expression and pandering to vulgar tastes, and the plays are sometimes not healthy), so just pick "Sanmao's Business Venture" to watch and have some fun. You won't complain about queuing in vain, unless you're too hard to please.

### 去看“三毛学生意”

    去看“三毛学生意”	李健吾
    万一你去上海的话，领略沪地风光，听我的建议，公余之暇，不妨去看一回大众滑稽剧团的“三毛学生意”。怕的是一连排几次队也买不到票。不过像你这样一位官僚主义者，多排几次队，再像中了头彩似地，走进“虹口戏院”那样一个社会角落，和“低级”趣味的观众坐在硬凳子上开怀大笑，你会觉得要比请假休养有作用多了。
    布幕拉开了，浅浅的舞台上，出现了一个小码头，旅客们下船又上岸，上岸又各奔前程，便见旧时代的两个黄包车夫抢生意，抢到赌气做赔钱生意，而你就从这时候起，一直笑到出场。
    可是有些地方，你要哭好半天哩。哭又哭不出来，那股子劲头儿可难受啦。顶要命的时候，是你正要哭，偏又要笑，两下里一“矛盾”，于是一边流眼泪，一边嘴张开了笑不合拢，舌头上咸咸的（不是盐水，是眼泪水），也不晓得是怎么回事。幸而观众不看自己，否则真会错以为文彬彬同志演三毛的面部造型演到自己的脸上了呢。
    文彬彬同志什么都好，就是几只金牙镶坏了。早知今日演苦人儿三毛，你后悔当初不该把假牙镶成金的。
    你和演理发师的刘侠声同志，还有演理发师老板娘的夏静同志那场长戏，我说什么也忘记不了。有谁见过理发师打学徒吗？去欣赏欣赏三毛把自己的屁股歪斜放在转椅上等打的“绝”戏罢。那可真是就连喜剧大师莫里哀也没有想到。
    有时候演员把戏演俗气了，那也太是意料之中的事。“高雅”社会原来就没有他们的份。他们在戏里夹上一些地方小调唱唱，也不足为怪。契诃夫爱看的“渥德维耳”（一种野生野长的法国滑稽戏），就是这样的。何况这种滑稽戏是在上海市民圈子里长大的。
    据说滑稽戏的前身就是文明戏，文明戏的前身就是早期话剧。我不太清楚这个传统。只是据闻（所以概不负责）这些滑稽戏前不久在上海举行过一次会演，一位苏联戏剧专家看过以后，像我平日一样天真，大声嚷嚷，“原来你们的话剧好演员都在这儿呀！”
    一个事实却是，还有一个滑稽剧团把莫里哀的“达尔杜弗”改成沪地风光的“活菩萨”，在上海连演了两三年，如今还要连演下去。我把这话告诉了法国著名的舞台演员费利浦，他又喜又惊，直怪洛瓦（一位来过中国的法国作家）写了一本大书介绍新中国，怎么就不提起这叫法国人听了兴奋的“大”事。
    我扯远了。你不可能看上海所有的滑稽戏（个别演员还停留在自我表现和媚俗阶段，戏有时候也欠健康），就挑一出“三毛学生意”看，寻寻乐儿也好。你不会抱怨白排队的，除非你这人太难伺候。
