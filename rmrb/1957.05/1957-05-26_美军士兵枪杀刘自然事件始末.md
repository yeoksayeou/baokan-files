The whole story of the U.S. Soldier Shooting and Killing Liu Ziran

Liu Ziran, a low-level official of a Kuomintang organization in Caoshan, Taipei, was shot and killed by Robert Reynolds, a sergeant in the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, on the evening of March 20 while passing near a U.S. military residence in Caoshan. After the tragedy, the murderer Reynolds and the U.S. military authorities stationed in Taiwan fabricated facts in an attempt to shirk responsibility, falsely accusing the deceased Liu Ziran of peeping at Reynolds' wife taking a bath outside the window that night. However, according to the on-site investigation results immediately after the murder, the bathroom in Reynolds' residence was very dry and without water marks, and the deceased's body was quite far away from the bathroom outdoors. Therefore, Taipei newspapers criticized this as a slander against the deceased by the murderer and demanded punishment.

However, the U.S. "Embassy" in Taiwan and the U.S. military repeatedly emphasized that U.S. military personnel in Taiwan enjoy "diplomatic immunity," and the Taiwanese authorities have no right to intervene in crimes committed. Therefore, Reynolds remained at large after the murder. Later, due to widespread criticism in Taiwanese newspapers, the U.S. military announced that the case would be investigated and handled by a U.S. military court. After the so-called "investigation" by U.S. military personnel, Reynolds was initially charged with "premeditated murder" of Liu Ziran. However, in the second trial, it was changed to "manslaughter." When the final verdict was announced on May 23, the murderer Reynolds was acquitted and the verdict was final and could not be appealed. At the time of the verdict, a burst of wild laughter and applause erupted from the U.S. military officers and soldiers in the gallery of the U.S. military court, drowning out the wailing of the deceased's wife nearby.

The murderer Reynolds is from Pennsylvania. After being acquitted, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group quickly sent him away from Taiwan by plane.

The deceased, Liu Ziran, was from Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. He was thirty-three years old and left behind his wife and a sixteen-month-old daughter.

On May 24, the day after the murderer Reynolds was acquitted by the U.S. military court, Liu Ziran's wife published a complaint in a Taiwanese newspaper entitled "I Cry Out to Society," in which she wrote: "Can an American sergeant kill people at will, while the life of a Chinese citizen is worthless?"… "Who has no parents? Who has no husband? Who has no children? The U.S. military authorities are so unreasonable and disregard human life. There are thousands of U.S. troops in Taiwan. If killing a Liu Ziran can be declared innocent, then there will inevitably be a second, third, and countless Liu Ziran incidents, and the lives and human rights of our people will have no guarantee." The complaint concluded: "I am indignant, I weep, I protest, I complain, but I am a lonely and weak woman, and I can only appeal to society."

On the morning of May 24, Liu Ziran's wife went on a hunger strike in front of the American Embassy. She held a complaint written in Chinese and English, saying: "Is the murderer Reynolds innocent? I protest to the U.S. military court and protest against this unfair verdict." At this time, the surging crowd became more and more angry and began to attack the American Embassy, ​​triggering a large-scale anti-American demonstration.

### 美军士兵枪杀刘自然事件始末

    美军士兵枪杀刘自然事件始末
    台北草山一个国民党机关的低级官员刘自然，3月20日晚上路过草山一幢美军住宅附近的时候，被美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团上士罗伯特·雷诺开枪打死。惨案发生后，凶手雷诺和驻台美军当局捏造事实，企图推诿罪责，诬指死者刘自然当晚在窗外偷窥雷诺的老婆洗澡。但是，根据凶案发生后立即进行的现场勘察结果，雷诺住宅中的浴室很干燥，没有水迹，另外死者的尸身在户外也距离浴室相当远，因此台北报纸都指责这是凶手对死者的污蔑，纷纷要求惩凶。
    但是，美国驻台湾“大使馆”和美国军方一再强调美军官兵在台湾享有“外交豁免权”，犯了罪台湾当局也无权过问。因此雷诺杀人后一直逍遥法外，后来因台湾报纸舆论纷纷抨击，美国军方才宣布这一案件由美军军事法庭调查处理。经过美军人员的所谓“调查”后，雷诺最初被控“蓄意谋杀”刘自然；但是，到了第二审却改为“误杀”；到了5月23日最后宣判时，杀人凶手雷诺竟被宣判“无罪”，并且作为最后定案，不能上诉。宣判时美军军事法庭旁听席上美军官兵响起了一阵阵狂笑声和掌声，掩没了在旁边的死者妻子的嚎哭声。
    凶手雷诺是美国宾夕法尼亚州人。他被宣判“无罪”后，美军顾问团赶紧派飞机送他逃离台湾。
    死者刘自然是江苏省无锡人，今年三十三岁，遗下妻子和一个只有十六个月的女儿。
    5月24日，即杀人凶手雷诺被美军法庭宣判“无罪”的第二天，刘自然的妻子在台湾报纸上发表了一篇题为“我向社会哭诉”的控诉书，其中写道：“难道一个美国军士便可肆意杀人，而一个中国公民的生命却就不值一顾？”……“谁无父母？谁无丈夫？谁无子女？美军当局如此不讲法理，草菅人命，在台湾的美军何止数千？如果打死一个刘自然可以宣告无罪，则今后势必将有第二个、第三个以至无数个的刘自然的事件出现，我国人的生命和人权可说毫无保障。”控诉书最后说：“我愤慨，我痛哭，我抗议，我控诉，可是我是一个孤苦伶仃弱女子，我只有向社会呼吁。”
    在24日上午，刘自然的妻子在美国大使馆门前进行绝食抗议。她拿着一张诉状，上面用汉文和英文写着：“凶手雷诺无罪吗？我向美国军事法庭抗议，向这种不公平的判决抗议。”这时汹涌而来的群众愈来愈愤怒，开始袭击美国大使馆，触发了反美大示威。
