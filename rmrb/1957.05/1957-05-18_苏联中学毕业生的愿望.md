    Wishes of Soviet Middle School Graduates
    Exams are about to begin, the school year is coming to an end, what to do after graduation? This is what tenth-grade students in middle schools all over the Soviet Union are considering.
    The Soviet Union has many institutions of higher learning, enrolling hundreds of thousands of new students every year, but it still cannot accommodate all middle school graduates. Last year, one million middle school students graduated across the Soviet Union, half of whom entered institutions of higher learning, and the other half went into production. The situation this year is similar. This is a normal phenomenon in a socialist country that implements universal education.
    In the Soviet Union, physical labor and intellectual labor are equally respected. Middle school graduates are deciding to participate in production on a school-wide and district-wide basis, and many are preparing to go to the countryside to work.
    All the middle schools in the Marinkyi District of Moscow will have one hundred and sixty young graduates. The various production units in the district have expressed their welcome to them, and most of them have decided to work in factories, collective farms, state farms, tractor stations, and rural construction teams. Kononeishina and three other tenth-grade students from the Second Middle School in this district said: "In school, we not only receive theoretical education, but our teachers teach us to love labor and to create material wealth with our own hands. Our whole life is connected with agriculture. We have been helping our families with farming since we were young. We have resolutely decided to stay in our hometown after the graduation examination and work in state farms and collective farms. Our place is in the countryside. Here lies our future, a life of happy labor." They plan to continue their correspondence studies while working.
    More than one hundred and eighty students from middle schools in the Old Minsk District of Kuban have decided to work on livestock farms of collective farms after graduation. They called on all middle school graduates in Kuban to follow their example and go to livestock farms. The letter said: "Agricultural laborers—our parents, brothers, and sisters—are faced with a task: to turn Kuban into a factory that produces meat and milk. We want to contribute our labor and our knowledge to this great undertaking. Let the livestock farms we will be joining become youth league members' and young people's livestock farms. We will work and continue our correspondence studies at colleges and technical schools." (17th)　Our Correspondent Li He

    苏联中学毕业生的愿望
    考试就要开始了，学年快要结束了，毕业后做什么？这是苏联各地中学十年级学生正在考虑的问题。
    苏联有许多高等学校，每年招收几十万新生，但是还是不能把所有中学毕业生都收进去。去年全苏有一百万中学生毕业，其中一半考进了高等学校，另一半投入了生产。今年的情形也类似。这是施行普及教育的社会主义国家的正常现象。
    在苏联，体力劳动和智力劳动一样受尊重。中学毕业生们整校整区地决定参加生产，许多人准备下乡劳动。
    莫斯科马林基区的所有中学，将有一百六十名青年毕业。区里各个生产单位表示欢迎他们，他们的大多数已经决定到工厂、集体农庄、国营农场、拖拉机站和农村建筑队工作。这个区的第二中学十年级学生科诺乃喜娜等四个人说：“我们在学校里不仅得到理论的教养，我们的教师教会我们爱劳动，以自己的双手创造物质财富。我们的全部生活都和农业联系着。我们从小就帮助家人农作。我们毅然决定在毕业考试后留在故乡，到国营农场和集体农庄工作。我们的位置在农村。这里有我们的未来，有幸福的劳动的生活。”她们计划在工作中继续函授学习。
    库班的旧敏斯克区各中学有一百八十多个学生决定在毕业后在集体农庄的养畜场工作。他们号召库班所有中学毕业生学他们的榜样，到养畜场去。信里说：“在农业劳动者——我们的父母兄姊的面前摆着一个任务：把库班变为盛产肉类和牛奶的工厂。我们要在这件大事中投进我们的劳动、我们的知识。让那些我们将要参加的养畜场成为共青团员和青年的养畜场。我们将工作并且将在学院和技术学校继续函授学习。”（17日）　本报记者　李何
