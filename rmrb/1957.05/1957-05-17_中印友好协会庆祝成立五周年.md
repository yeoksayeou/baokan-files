    Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting.

He said: The friendship and understanding between India and China, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has had a great impact internationally and is of great significance to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
