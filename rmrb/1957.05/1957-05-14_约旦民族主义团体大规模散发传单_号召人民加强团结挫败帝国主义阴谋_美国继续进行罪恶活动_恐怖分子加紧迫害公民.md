Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 12th - The Middle East News Agency's Amman correspondent, who arrived in Damascus on May 10th, reported that although royalist Bedouin troops are stationed in all major cities of Jordan, Jordanian nationalist groups are still massively distributing leaflets there.

These leaflets attack Jordan's current policies and expose the details of conspiracies against the Jordanian people. Children, some under the age of ten, are also participating in the leaflet distribution. Some of them have been arrested and beaten by the Iraqi Prime Minister's repression "experts."

The correspondent said that during the recent climax of events in Jordan, various Jordanian nationalist parties issued a statement calling on the people to strengthen resistance in order to thwart conspiracies and establish a truly nationalist regime. The statement said, "On our side are Egypt, Syria, Asian and African countries, the socialist camp, and all peace-loving people. We will not be intimidated by the threats of Israeli villains or the threats of American imperialism."

The correspondent said that in Jordanian cities, villages, and Bedouin settlements, reactionaries are forcing citizens to sign documents guaranteeing support for the current regime. If citizens refuse to do so, Bedouin troops surround their residential areas, arrest their leaders, and implement a reign of terror. Colonel Mayer, once an assistant to British officer Glubb, is in charge of this operation.

The Jordanian military investigation committee is still fabricating charges against patriotic officers. A large number of civil servants have recently been arrested. Many people have been dismissed from their jobs because of their political beliefs. More than seven hundred civil servants have been dismissed, and at least four hundred teachers have been dismissed. A large number of senior students in Jordanian schools have been expelled on charges of "political activities." Schools in Jordan are still not open.

Meanwhile, according to a report from the Middle East News Agency, the United States continues to carry out conspiracies in Jordan. During Eid al-Fitr, the U.S. Embassy in Jordan invited the chiefs of the Bedouin tribes to a banquet and distributed to them a book written by the Jordanian Deputy Minister of Interior, which fiercely attacked the Nabulsi government and nationalist parties. The U.S. Embassy later distributed this book on a large scale.

Xinhua News Agency, May 13th - Jordanian police continued to arrest eight more patriots on May 12th, on charges of "inciting others to demonstrate."

The curfew order has been partially lifted in Amman. However, if any resident goes out between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., they risk being shot by the patrol, or at least being arrested and imprisoned.

The curfew has also been lifted in Jerusalem. (Attached picture)

    约旦民族主义团体大规模散发传单

    美国继续进行罪恶活动　恐怖分子加紧迫害公民
    据新华社开罗12日电　5月10日到达大马士革的中东通讯社驻安曼记者报道，虽然在约旦所有的主要城市里都集结着保皇的贝都印部队，但是，约旦的民族主义团体仍然在那里大规模散发传单。
    这些传单攻击约旦目前的政策，并且揭露了对约旦人民的阴谋的详情。不满十岁的儿童也参加了散发传单的工作。其中有些人遭到伊拉克首相的镇压“专家”的逮捕和毒打。
    这位记者说，在最近约旦事件的高潮期间，约旦各民族主义党派发表了一项声明，呼吁人民加强抵抗，以便挫败阴谋，建立真正的民族主义政权。声明说，“在我们这一边的有埃及、叙利亚、亚非国家、社会主义阵营以及所有爱好和平的人们。以色列罪恶分子的恐吓和美帝国主义的威胁都吓不倒我们。”
    这位记者说，在约旦城市、乡村和贝都印人聚居地区，反动分子正强迫公民们在保证支持目前的政权的文件上签字。公民们如果拒绝这样做，贝都印部队就把他们居住的地区包围起来，逮捕他们的领袖人物，并且实行恐怖统治。一度是英国军官格拉布的助手的梅耶上校就是这一行动的负责人。
    约旦军事调查委员会仍在捏造攻击爱国军官的罪状。近来逮捕了大批公务员。许多人由于政治信仰的关系被解除了工作。被解除工作的公务员已经有七百多人，被解职的教师至少有四百人。约旦学校里的大批高年级学生给加上“政治活动”的罪名被开除了。约旦的学校仍然没有复课。
    同时，据中东通讯社记者报道，美国继续在约旦进行阴谋活动。在开斋节期间，美国驻约旦大使馆曾邀请贝都印部族的酋长们参加宴会，并且把约旦内政副大臣写的激烈攻击纳布西政府和民族主义政党的一本书分发给他们。美国大使馆后来还大量地散发这本书。
    据新华社13日讯　约旦警察5月12日又继续逮捕了八名爱国人士，罪名是“煽动别人示威”。
    在安曼已经部分地取消了宵禁令。但是，如果任何居民在晚上十点到早晨五点钟之间出门的话，就有被巡逻队枪毙的危险，至少也会被捕和坐牢。
    耶路撒冷也已经取消宵禁。（附图片）
