Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: State Council Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun invited non-Party members working in the State Council's Legislative Affairs Bureau, Counselor's Office, and General Office to a forum this afternoon to solicit opinions and help the Communist Party rectify its work style.

　　Xi Zhongxun asked everyone at the meeting to dispel their concerns and raise any opinions they had.

　　More than thirty non-Party members attended the forum. Many counselors had just returned from inspections in various regions, and they enthusiastically expressed their opinions at the meeting.

　　Li Zhonggong, a State Council Counselor, felt that some people seemed hesitant to speak. He said that they should boldly express their opinions, and it didn't matter if they were wrong.

　　Li Zhonggong disagreed with Luo Longji's views on the issue of reversing unjust verdicts at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee forum. He said that the reversal of unjust verdicts should be treated very cautiously.

　　Li Zhonggong said that during the period of sharp class struggle, in a country with 600 million people, no matter how capable one is, unless God appears, how can one avoid making any deviations?

　　He said that even with leadership, the Party and the government sometimes find it difficult to control mass struggles. For example, in the struggle of poor peasants against landlords, it is inevitable that excessive actions will occur.

　　He said that simply emphasizing reversals, with everyone seeking to overturn verdicts, and landlords and rich peasants also crying injustice, how can this work?

　　Li Zhonggong then opposed Luo Longji's opinion that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the CPPCC should directly handle the cases of reversing verdicts.

　　Li Zhonggong emphasized that these two bodies should play a supervisory role. If the judicial organs do not perform well, they can supervise them. But if Luo Longji's approach is followed, and all cases are handled directly by the state power organs simply because you are not doing well or we don't believe you can do well, would that work?

　　Li Zhonggong also criticized Wang Kunlun's statement that democratic parties should fully participate in the formulation of national policies. Li Zhonggong said that democratic parties are now participating in national affairs, not not participating. Representatives from various democratic parties participate in the state power organs. If every matter requires calling democratic parties to meetings, it is impossible.

　　He said that Wang Kunlun's statement is a kind of unprincipled, general democratic thought.

　　He said that this still reflects bourgeois democratic thought to some extent.

　　Li Zhonggong also criticized Long Yun, saying that Long Yun had said something like this: "In the past few major movements, the Communist Party has been rectifying people." Li Zhonggong said, who is the Communist Party rectifying? The Communist Party is rectifying enemies and bad people. How can you raise the question like this without analysis?

　　Wang Genzhong said that leaders and those led in State Council organs meet too little.

　　Wang Genzhong, a State Council Counselor, said that leaders and those led in State Council organs meet too little, making it difficult to resolve some ideological issues. He said that he is a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association. From the perspective of democratic parties, this aspect of the problem should be managed by the United Front Work Department, but the United Front Work Department cannot manage it all. He believes that administrative departments should also take on ideological work.

　　Zhang Youjiang, a State Council Counselor, talked about how to break through concerns during the "letting go" process. He said that concerns can be divided into two types: one is the suspicion that the Communist Party wants everyone to offer opinions as a "lure the enemy in deep, concentrate and annihilate" tactic, which is wrong. The other is the fear that offering opinions will affect one's evaluation, rewards, transfer, etc. He said that although people with such concerns are not right, they are understandable. He believes that an important way to dispel these concerns is to rectify the work style while improving it. This will enable everyone to be more active.

　　Zhang Youjiang also talked about the problem of unification at the top but not at the bottom. He believes that this problem is particularly present in government organs, grassroots units, remote areas, and small and medium-sized cities, which makes the relationship between the Party and the masses abnormal. He hopes that the Party will strengthen the publicity of the united front policy and strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses. Zhang Youjiang also talked about how to study and improve the work of the Counselor's Office from a systemic perspective.

　　Wan Baobang, a State Council Counselor, believes that the United Front Work Department has more contact with senior democratic figures and less contact with middle and lower-level democratic figures. He hopes that the United Front Work Department will improve. Wan Baobang also talked about how to deal with some of the remaining issues from the uprising armed forces led by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang before liberation and personnel arrangements.

　　Jiao Shizhai disagrees with the view that fundamentally negates the joint directives issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council

　　Jiao Shizhai, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC working in the Legislative Affairs Bureau, pointed out at the meeting that there is confusion in the issuance of various regulations and directives by the State Council and various offices and departments. He said that sometimes lower-level units receive directives from several parties on the same matter, which increases the difficulty for lower-level units to implement. He requested that the Secretary-General of the State Council should achieve comprehensive balance and overall consideration in these aspects.

　　Jiao Shizhai disagreed with the view that fundamentally negates the joint directives issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. He believes that it is acceptable to issue joint directives on important issues, but the problem is that there should not be too many or too many abuses; too many will lose their important meaning.

　　Jiao Shizhai just returned from an inspection in Shandong. Based on what he saw during the inspection, he criticized the phenomenon of "lack of separation between Party and government" in grassroots work. He said that in some places, there is no separation between the Party, the government, and the commune, and some cooperatives even handle marriage registration and household registration. Some CPC prefectural committees can negate the directives of the provincial people's committee, and some CPC district committees can negate the directives of the county people's committee. This situation should be changed.

　　Jiao Shizhai believes that the reason for the lack of separation between Party and government is the unsound meeting system. Lower-level cadres like to use cadre meetings and one-size-fits-all meetings to promote work. He said that in the past, the civil affairs department was in charge of political power construction work, but it was criticized later, and the civil affairs department no longer manages it, and other departments do not manage it either. He hopes that this problem should be solved.

　　Wan Maizi believes that there are too many deputies from the central to the local level

　　Wan Maizi, a State Council Counselor, believes that today the Communist Party is adopting the policy of great airing of views to resolve contradictions among the people, distinguish right from wrong, and improve work. This is a reflection of socialist democratic life. Then, Wan Maizi offered opinions on the personnel system. He said that there are too many deputies from the central to the local level. He believes that the advantage of this is that it can concentrate command and collective leadership, but whether it can play such a role below the county level is doubtful. He said that there is a county with more than a dozen deputy county heads; some county organization departments have only one cadre, and the rest are ministers and deputy ministers.

　　Wan Maizi also talked about the issue of professional treatment for social figures. He believes that although this problem cannot be solved all at once, it should be solved gradually.

　　Regarding the issue of writing reform, Wan Maizi said that he strongly supports the simplification of Chinese characters and the horizontal arrangement of newspapers and magazines. He believes that this has created good conditions for future writing reform. However, on the one hand, we want to implement writing reform; on the other hand, middle school textbooks extensively select classical literature, which is contradictory. He said, is it a mistake of subjectivism to have students study classical literature extensively?

　　Xu Xingzhi criticizes the special treatment of some senior cadres' children and wives

　　Xu Xingzhi, a State Council Counselor, criticized the special treatment of some senior cadres. He said that Beijing Hospital specializes in treating senior cadres above the seventh grade. This kind of care is also appropriate, but some senior cadres' family members also enjoy the preferential treatment of public medical care, and some even send four or five of their children with colds to the hospital for hospitalization. Some simply send their fathers and mothers to the hospital for hospitalization as soon as it gets cold. This has also made some senior cadres' children and wives develop a special sense of superiority.

　　Xu Xingzhi said that this special treatment should be abolished during the rectification campaign. He said that overcoming this shortcoming is not difficult. He hopes that the State Council will pay attention to this issue and take immediate measures.

　　Wang Zhixiang said that legal work should be done quickly

　　Wang Zhixiang, an advisor to the Legislative Affairs Bureau, believes that some people still have concerns about exposing contradictions and properly handling contradictions. He said that most of those who express opinions now are middle and upper-level democratic figures, while teaching assistants and lecturers do not, and government cadres also talk very little. He believes that they should be allowed to talk more, as they are the ones doing the actual work, and only by talking thoroughly can work be improved.

　　Regarding legal issues, Wang Zhixiang said that the first five-year plan is about to be completed, and legal work should be done quickly. He believes that in a period of great change, it is easier to do things with written regulations. He said that today we have the conditions to use legal thinking to implement the leadership of the country. For example, it would be easier to do things if there were a system and a standard for evaluations, rewards, and punishments. Wang Zhixiang emphasized that the work of the Legislative Affairs Bureau is very important. He suggested: (1) Launch a discussion on old laws, criticize the bad parts, and retain the reasonable and good parts; (2) Mobilize the enthusiasm of the old intellectuals who know English, Japanese, and French, arrange them, and give them appropriate work; (3) Strengthen legal education so that everyone abides by the law, so as to guarantee work.

    听取机关干部意见改进实际工作
    国务院机关党外人士举行座谈
    李仲公批评了罗隆基、王昆仑、龙云等人的意见
    据新华社27日讯　国务院秘书长习仲勋今天下午邀请在国务院法制局、参事室、秘书厅工作的党外人士举行座谈会，征求意见，帮助共产党整风。
    习仲勋在会上要求大家消除顾虑，有什么意见提什么意见。
    出席座谈会的党外人士共三十多人，有许多参事刚从各地视察回来，他们在会上踊跃地发表了意见。
    国务院参事李仲公认为有些人谈话似乎还有顾虑，他说，应该大胆地发表意见，说错了也没有关系。
    李仲公不赞成罗隆基在中共中央统战部座谈会上关于错案平反问题的看法。他说，对错案平反这件事，应该非常慎重地来对待。
    李仲公说，在尖锐的阶级斗争时期，在这样一个六亿人口的国家里，无论怎样有能力，除非上帝出现，怎么能够做到一点没有偏差呢？
    他说，何况在群众斗争中有的时候党和政府也是很难掌握的，例如贫农斗争地主，虽有领导也难免不发生过火行动。
    他说，单纯强调平反，大家都来翻案，地主富农也来喊冤，这怎么行呢？
    接着李仲公对罗隆基关于由人大常委会和政协全国委员会直接处理平反案件的意见提出了反对的意见。
    李仲公强调说，这两个机关应该起监督作用，如果司法机关办的不好，它可以监督，如果照罗隆基的办法，只要你办的不好或者不相信你能办好，就都由国家权力机关直接办理，这是否行呢？
    李仲公还批评了王昆仑关于民主党派应该充分参加国家大事制定决议的说法。李仲公说，现在民主党派是参与了国家大事，而不是没有参与，各个民主党派都有代表参加国家权力机关，如果任何事情都把民主党派找来开会，这是不可能的。
    他说，王昆仑的这种说法，是一种无原则的一般的民主思想。
    他说，这多少还表现了资产阶级的民主思想。
    李仲公还批评了龙云，他说龙云曾说过这样的话：“过去几个大运动，都是共产党整人。”李仲公说，共产党是整什么人呢？共产党是整的敌人，坏人，怎么能不加分析地这样来提问题呢？
    王艮仲说国务院机关领导者和被领导者见面太少
    国务院参事王艮仲说，国务院机关的领导者和被领导者见面太少，有些思想问题不易解决。他说，他是民主建国会的成员，从民主党派的角度来看，这方面的问题应该由统战部管起来，但统战部门管不过来。他认为行政部门也应该把思想工作担负起来。
    国务院参事章友江谈到在“放”的过程中如何打破顾虑的问题。他说，顾虑可以分为两种：一种是怀疑共产党要大家提意见是“诱敌深入，集中歼灭”，这种看法是错误的。另一种是，怕提意见后影响到自己的评级、评奖、调动等。他说，存在这种顾虑的人虽然不对，但可以理解。他认为要解除这些顾虑很重要的是边整风，边改进。这样就可以发挥大家的积极性。
    章友江还谈到统上不统下的问题，他认为在机关、基层、边远地区、中小城市特别存在这个问题，因而使得党群关系不正常。他希望党要加强统一战线政策的宣传，加强党和群众的联系。章友江还谈到如何从制度上来研究改进参事室的工作问题。
    国务院参事万保邦认为统战部接触高级民主人士多，接触中下层民主人士少。他希望统战部改进。万保邦还谈到如何处理解放前夕民革所领导的起义武装和人事安排上的一些遗留问题。
    焦实斋不同意那种根本否定党中央和国务院发联合指示的看法
    在法制局工作的政协全国委员会委员焦实斋在会上指出国务院和各办公室、各部发布各种法规、指示的时候有混乱现象，他说，有时下面在一件事情上收到几个方面的指示，这就增加了下级机关执行的困难。他要求国务院秘书长应该在这些方面做到综合平衡、统筹兼顾。
    焦实斋不同意那种根本否定党中央和国务院发联合指示的看法，他认为对重要的问题发联合指示是可以的，问题在于不要太多太滥，多了就失去了重要的意义。
    焦实斋刚从山东视察回来，他根据视察所见批评了基层工作中“党政不分”的现象。他说，有些地方党政社不分，有些合作社也办理起婚姻登记和户口登记等工作了。有的中共地委可以否定省人民委员会的指示，中共区委可以否定县人民委员会的指示，这种情况应该改变。
    焦实斋认为，党政不分的原因是会议制度不健全，下面干部喜欢用干部会、一揽子会来推动工作。他说，过去民政部门管政权建设工作，后来受到了批判，民政部门不管了，其他部门也不管。他希望这个问题应该设法解决。
    万枚子认为从中央到地方副职太多
    国务院参事万枚子认为，今天共产党采取大鸣大放的方针来解决人民内部矛盾，明辨是非，改进工作，这是社会主义民主生活的体现。接着，万枚子对人事制度提了意见。他说，从中央到地方，副职太多。他认为，这样的好处是能够集中指挥，集体领导，但到县以下能否起这样的作用就值得怀疑。他说，有一个县，副县长多到十几人；有的县组织部只有一个干部，其余都是部长、副部长。
    万枚子还谈到对社会人士的职业处理问题，他认为这个问题虽不能一下子解决，但要逐步解决。
    关于文字改革问题，万枚子说，他非常拥护简化汉字和报纸、杂志的横排。他认为这对未来文字改革创造了良好的条件。但是，一面要实行文字改革；一面中学课本又大量选用古典文学，这就矛盾了。他说，要学生大量学习古典文学，是否犯了主观主义的毛病？
    徐行之批评一些高级干部的子女、太太特殊化
    国务院参事徐行之批评了某些高级干部特殊化的表现。他说，北京医院专门给七级以上的高级干部看病，这种照顾也是应当的，但是有些高级干部的家属也去享受公费医疗的优待，有的甚至一起把四、五个得了感冒病的孩子也送去住院。有的因为天刚冷就干脆把自己的父亲母亲送到医院住院了。这样也就使得一些高级干部的子女、太太养成了一种高人一等的特殊化的思想。
    徐行之说，应该趁着整风的机会取消这种特殊化的做法。他说，克服这种缺点并不困难，他希望国务院重视这个问题，立即采取措施。
    王之相说法制工作要赶快作起来
    法制局顾问王之相认为，有些人对于揭发矛盾、正确处理矛盾还有顾虑。他说，现在发表意见的多是中上层民主人士，而助教、讲师就没有，机关干部也谈得很少。他认为应该多让他们谈谈，他们是作实际工作的，谈透了才能改进工作。
    关于法制问题，王之相说，第一个五年计划快完成，法制工作要赶快作起来。他认为，在大变动时期，有了条文规定就好办事。他说，我们今天有条件用法律的思想来实行对国家的领导。例如评级、奖惩如果有个制度、有个标准就好办事。王之相强调法制局的工作很重要，他建议：（一）对旧法展开讨论，批判不好的部分，保留合理的好的部分；（二）把会英、日、法语的旧知识分子的积极性调动起来，安排他们，给他们适当的工作；（三）加强法制教育，让大家遵守法制，这样才能保证工作。
