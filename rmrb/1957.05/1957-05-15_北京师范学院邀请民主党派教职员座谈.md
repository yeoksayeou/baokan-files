Beijing Normal College Invites Democratic Party Faculty and Staff to a Symposium

(Our report) The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Normal College invited faculty and staff members of democratic parties at the college to a symposium on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss internal contradictions within the college. Attendees raised many opinions regarding the relationship between the Party and the masses within the college, as well as the leadership work of the college. Many people said in their speeches that the relationship between the Party and the masses at Beijing Normal College was not normal and that there was a disconnect. Lin Chuanding, the Dean of Academic Affairs, said: All members of the school affairs committee, except for himself, are Communist Party members. The coordination between the Party and administrative work also has more or less problems. The college still cannot treat non-Party cadres the same as Party members on certain issues. For example, the college requires that it be fully responsible for students, but if the head of a department is a non-Party cadre, they cannot view the students' files and cannot know the students' thoughts and other aspects. This situation is not unique to Beijing Normal College; other colleges also have this problem. At the meeting, Lin Chuanding also talked about the privileged thinking of individual Party member leaders in the Ministry of Education. He said that Li Bin's wife, the Director of the Higher Normal Education Department of the Ministry of Education, became the head of the Preschool Education Research Group at Beijing Normal University without going through any procedures or obtaining the consent of the president; she was smuggled in. He said: At that time, he was still the Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs at Beijing Normal University. He had raised opinions about this matter and had written a letter to Liu Shi, the Deputy Minister of Education, but had never received a reply, and instead caused some unpleasantness. Some teachers said: There is little contact or heart-to-heart talks between Party members and the masses in normal times. Xiang Jinjiang, a lecturer in the Chinese Department, said: The relationship between Party members and the masses is not intimate and seamless, but rather there is a disconnect. Party members and the masses have nothing to say and no common language.

At the meeting, some people also talked about the opinions of the college leadership on the training and employment of teachers. More than ten members of the China Democratic League, China National Democratic Construction Association, Jiusan Society, and Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang at the college attended the meeting.

    北京师范学院邀请民主党派教职员座谈
    本报讯　中共北京师范学院工作委员会于14日下午邀请本校民主党派教职人员，座谈学校内部的矛盾。到会者对于学校党同群众之间的关系以及学校领导工作，提出不少意见。许多人在发言中说，北京师范学院党同群众之间的关系不够正常，存在隔阂。林传鼎教务长说：校务委员会除他而外，都是共产党员。党同行政工作的配合或多或少也有问题。学校里对于非党干部在某些问题上还不能同党员一样相待，例如学校要求对于学生要全面负责，但是，系科主任如果是非党干部，就不能看学生的档案材料，不可能知道学生思想等各方面的情况。这种情况不是北京师范学院一个学校的问题，其他学校也都存在这个问题。林传鼎在会上也谈到教育部个别党员领导干部有特权思想，他说，教育部高等师范教育司司长李宾的爱人到北京师范大学任学前教研组组长，根本没通过任何手续，也未征得校长的同意，是走私进去的。他说：那时他还在北京师大任副教务长，为这件事他曾经提出过意见，并且给教育部柳湜副部长去过信，但一直没有得到答复，反而引起些不愉快。有些教师说：党员同群众之间平时很少接触，谈心。中文系讲师向锦江说：党员和群众之间不是亲密无间的，而是有隔阂的。党员和群众之间没话可说，没有共同语言。
    会上，有些人还谈到学校领导对于教师的培养、用人等方面的意见。参加这次会议的有该校民盟、民建、九三学社和民革的盟员、会员等十余人。
