Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: According to TASS, New York, May 22nd: The American Progressive Labor Research Association's newly published biennial "Labor Facts" uses rich factual materials to expose the myth of American "People's Capitalism" spread by American propaganda organs.

The book points out that approximately 500 of the largest U.S. companies concentrate about half of the total U.S. industrial output and nearly half of the industrial workers. Their profits account for 68% of U.S. private enterprise profits. Many of these companies are controlled by financial oligarchs such as Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont, and Mellon.

Wall Street's role as a "stronghold of American financial power" continues to strengthen year by year. The materials in the book show that transactions on the New York Stock Exchange account for 90% of all securities transactions in the country. Commercial loans provided by Wall Street banks account for one-third of all commercial loans in the United States, and financial loans account for three-fifths. At the same time, the overseas operations of six New York banks account for two-thirds of all overseas banking operations, and the securities issued by fifteen Wall Street investment companies account for two-thirds of the total number of U.S. securities.

Statistical materials on national income distribution and savings accumulation also refute the myth of "People's Capitalism." According to official statistics, 36% of American families have an annual income of $3,000. This is much lower than the official minimum cost of living. Farmers' incomes last year were 26% lower than in 1948.

    美“劳工实况”以丰富材料揭露
    美国“人民资本主义”是鬼话
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：美国进步劳工研究协会新出版的两年一期的“劳工实况”以丰富的事实材料，揭露了美国宣传机关所散布的关于美国“人民资本主义”的神话。
    这本书指出，五百家美国规模最大的公司大约集中了美国工业总产量的一半和差不多二分之一的产业工人。它们的利润占美国私人企业利润的68％。这些公司有许多是受洛克菲勒、摩根、杜邦、梅隆这些财政寡头控制的。
    华尔街作为“美国财政实力要塞”的作用仍在逐年加强。书中的材料表明，纽约证券交易所的交易占国内全部有价证券交易的90％。华尔街银行所提供的商业贷款占美国全部商业贷款的三分之一，财政贷款占五分之三。同时，六家纽约银行在国外经营的业务占全部国外银行业务的三分之二，十五家华尔街投资公司所发行的有价证券占美国有价证券总数的三分之二。
    关于国民收入分配和储金积累的统计材料也反驳了“人民资本主义”的神话。根据官方统计材料，美国有36％的家庭每年收入三千美元。这比官方的最低生活费要低得多。农民收入在去年比1948年低了26％。
