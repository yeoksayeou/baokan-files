Xinhua News Agency, May 5th. Chairman Voroshilov visited Peking University today at noon. The head of our great ally instructed the university students: They must tenaciously grasp all the essence created by human wisdom, and cultivate themselves into experts with a high level of expertise and builders of the new society.

In the beautiful campus, Chairman Voroshilov was warmly welcomed by more than eight thousand teachers and students. At the school gate, along the roads, on the hillsides, by the Weiming Lake, and in the green trees, enthusiastic teachers and students applauded and cheered Voroshilov everywhere. On the green lawns, students wore colorful costumes, dancing various graceful dances to welcome the distinguished guests. Female students presented flowers to Voroshilov, and Young Pioneers tied red scarves around Voroshilov's neck. The children of the university's affiliated elementary school also lined up to welcome the distinguished guests. When Voroshilov walked in front of the children, he imitated their movements, jumping, cheering, and applauding with them, and shaking hands with them from time to time.

Today, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Minister Yang Xiufeng accompanied Voroshilov and the Soviet guests on their visit. Peng Zhen said to Voroshilov: This used to be the base camp of John Leighton Stuart.

After getting acquainted with President Ma Yinchu, Voroshilov spoke with great interest about the university's situation. Ma Yinchu said that there are now more than ten Soviet experts working in the school and more than fifty Soviet students studying here. Voroshilov asked with concern: How are they working and studying? Ma Yinchu said: The Soviet experts have been of great help to us, and the Soviet students are studying very hard and doing well. Ma Yinchu also presented gifts to Voroshilov on behalf of the school, including "Zizhi Tongjian" and "Romance of the West Chamber."

Two Soviet students, a male and a female, came to Voroshilov and presented him with a letter and a statue of "Old Man of Longevity." The students said: "According to Chinese custom, the Old Man of Longevity symbolizes longevity. All of us Soviet students wish you boundless longevity." Voroshilov laughed, his chestnut eyes looking at the two Soviet students, his two large hands touching the head of the Old Man of Longevity, and said: "What if God doesn't let me live long? What if the Old Man of Longevity can't guarantee my longevity?" The Soviet students said: "You will definitely live long." Voroshilov was amused by this sentence and laughed heartily. He said to the two Soviet students: "Thank you, you must study hard!"

After visiting the Biology Building, Voroshilov strolled along the Weiming Lake to the front of the office building. Here, thousands of teachers and students had been waiting for Voroshilov. Voroshilov put on his glasses and, amidst cheers and applause, walked to the microphone to deliver a speech to the entire school. His speech was constantly interrupted by applause and cheers.

Before Voroshilov's speech, Ma Yinchu delivered a speech to welcome the distinguished guests. After Voroshilov's speech, a male and female student carried a large frame inlaid with the emblem of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to Voroshilov. The students said to Voroshilov, "Our gift is composed of the 'Three Goods' commemorative badges of seventy-six 'Three Goods' students. The number of commemorative badges is the same as Voroshilov's age. All of us students sincerely wish Voroshilov boundless longevity."

Voroshilov accepted the students' gift, excitedly hugged and kissed the two students again and again. Then he walked to the microphone again and said, "I thank you for the precious gift you have given me. These seventy-six commemorative badges represent my age. Of course, I would be very happy if there were twenty or thirty fewer commemorative badges, because that would mean I am twenty or thirty years younger than I am now. But this is impossible, and I don't think Mayor Peng Zhen can help me remedy this!" At this moment, Voroshilov looked at Mayor Peng Zhen and laughed, and everyone was amused by Voroshilov's words and burst into laughter.

Voroshilov then said to the students: "With a feeling of joy and youth like yours, I wish you success in your studies. In the future, you will not only work for the happiness of your own people, but also for the happiness of the people of all countries in the world."

Following this, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin, entrusted by Chairman Voroshilov, announced to the teachers and students that three thousand five hundred volumes of scientific and educational books would be donated to Peking University.

Afterward, Voroshilov passed through the crowds lining the streets and walked out of the gate of Peking University. At this time, all the teachers and students shouted "Long live!" and "Goodbye!" in unison, and the band played the "Beijing-Moscow" melody. (Attached picture)

    同北京大学八千师生欢聚一堂
    伏老畅抒青春的心情
    新华社5日讯　伏罗希洛夫主席今天中午参观了北京大学。这位伟大盟邦的元首教导大学生们：要顽强地掌握人类智慧所创造的一切精华，把自己培养成为具有高度水平的专家，新社会的建设者。
    在美丽的校园里，伏罗希洛夫主席受到了八千多名师生的热烈欢迎。在校门口，在道路两旁，在山坡上，在未名湖畔，在绿树丛中，到处都有热情的师生向伏老鼓掌欢呼。在绿草如茵的草坪上学生们穿着多采的服装，跳着各种多姿的舞蹈欢迎贵宾。女学生们把鲜花送给伏老，少年先锋队员把红领巾系在伏老的颈项上。这所大学附属小学的小朋友也列队欢迎贵宾。伏老走到孩子的前面时，摹仿着孩子们的动作和孩子们一起跳跃着，欢呼和鼓掌，不时同孩子们拉手。
    今天，邓小平副总理、彭真副委员长和杨秀峰部长陪同伏老和苏联贵宾们参观。彭真对伏老说：这里，过去是司徒雷登的大本营。
    伏老同马寅初校长认识以后，兴致勃勃地谈着这个大学的情况。马寅初说，现在这所学校有十多位苏联专家在工作，有五十多名苏联学生在学习。伏老关心地问：他们工作、学习得怎样？马寅初说：苏联专家们对我们帮助很大，苏联留学生们学习都很努力，学习也很好。马寅初还代表学校向伏老送了礼品，其中有“资治通鉴”，还有“西厢记”。
    两名苏联男女留学生来到伏老面前，他们把一封信和一尊“老寿星”送给伏老。学生们说：“按照中国的习惯，老寿星是长寿的意思，我们全体苏联留学生祝你万寿无疆。”伏老笑了，他那栗色的眼睛看着两位苏联学生，两只大手摸着老寿星的头说：“如果上帝不让我长寿怎么办？老寿星不能保证我长寿怎么办？”苏联学生说：“一定长寿。”伏老被这句话逗得大笑起来了，他对两位苏联学生说：“谢谢你们，你们要好好学习！”
    在参观了生物楼以后，伏老又沿着未名湖畔漫步到办公楼前。在这里，几千名师生早已在等候伏老了。伏老戴上了他的眼镜在欢呼和掌声中走向扩音器前，向全校师生发表了演说。他的演说不断被掌声和欢呼声打断。
    伏老演说以前，马寅初致词欢迎贵宾们。伏老演说以后，一对男女学生抬着一个镶有中苏友好协会会徽图案的大镜框跑到伏老面前，学生们对伏老说，我们的这件礼物是由七十六个三好同学的三好纪念章组成的，纪念章同伏老的年龄一样，我们全体同学衷心地祝伏老万寿无疆。”
    伏老接受了学生们的礼物，激动地同这两个学生亲了又亲，吻了吻。随后他又走到扩音器前讲话说：“我感谢你们给我的珍贵的礼物，这七十六个纪念章就是我的年龄。当然纪念章再少二三十个我也是会很高兴的，因为那就是说我比现在年轻二三十岁。可是这是办不到的事情，我想彭真市长也没有办法帮助我补救吧！”这时，伏老望着彭真市长大笑起来，所有的人都被伏老的话引得大笑起来。
    伏老又对学生们说：“我怀着像你们一样充满着喜悦和青春的心情，祝你们学习成功。你们将来不仅要为自己祖国人民的幸福工作，而且要为世界上一切国家人民的幸福而工作。”
    接着，苏联高等教育部部长叶留金，接受伏罗希洛夫主席的委托向师生们宣布，将三千五百册科学和教育书籍赠送给北京大学。
    随后，伏老穿过夹道的人群迈出北京大学的校门，这时全体师生齐声欢呼万岁和再见，乐队奏起了“北京—莫斯科”乐曲。（附图片）
