Having Learned Furnace Construction Techniques, They Still Carry Soil and Bricks
Four Hundred Young Workers at Wuhan Steel Works Voluntarily Become Laborers

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, 11th) The four hundred young workers trained by the Furnace Construction Company of Wuhan Steel Works went to the Daye Steel Plant construction site, the Tieshan construction site, and the Wuhan Steel Works factory area construction site in late April to carry mud and bricks. The young workers who went to the Daye Steel Plant construction site exceeded their quotas on the first day, and have since averaged about 20% above their quotas.

When this group of young people were recruited last year, the leaders said, "After six months of study, you will be able to take the exam for a third or fourth-grade technician." Many students were focused on becoming third-grade workers after graduation, earning more than forty yuan a month. Some were planning to buy clothes for their loved ones after their wages increased. When they heard that there were no work assignments after graduation, some young workers asked to continue studying, while others said they would jump into the river to commit suicide if they couldn't become third-grade workers.

The company party committee and the training class branch committee, in conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's speeches, analyzed the students' situation. They believed that the vast majority of the students were from working-class backgrounds, and their ideological understanding had generally improved after the education on building the country through diligence and frugality since this spring. As long as they strengthened political and ideological work and explained the real difficulties, they would consciously work as ordinary workers. They began by conveying Chairman Mao's speech to these young workers and made a report on increasing production and practicing economy in light of the company's situation, pointing out that there were no furnace construction tasks after graduation, and that being an ordinary worker was also building socialism, which was beneficial to the country. At the same time, having a certain income from work was also beneficial to individuals. Then, they used methods such as inviting veteran workers to talk about the suffering of apprentices in the old society to educate them on hard work.

After such a period of education, the young workers generally reflected: "In the past, studying for six months has cost the country a lot of money, and I have not made any contribution to the country. It is not right to ask for the treatment of a third-grade worker." "The country has difficulties, and it is good for me to carry soil, so I don't want to stay and study and spend more money." Student Yu Xingzhong, when participating in the Han River flood diversion in the past, thought that carrying soil was shameful, threw away his carrying pole and iron hook, and tore off his shoulder pads to make shorts, vowing never to do carrying soil work again. After entering the training class, he also wrote to his lover saying that he would be a furnace builder in the future and would never carry soil again. But after this education, especially after hearing that some seventh and eighth-grade master workers in the company were also carrying soil at the construction site, he began to feel that his thinking was not right. His lover also wrote back criticizing his ideas, telling him not to forget his roots. Therefore, he also automatically criticized himself, saying, "I was a farmer a few years ago, how can I say that carrying soil is not respectable?" The young workers in the entire training class group wrote guarantees, saying, "Individual small difficulties are subordinate to the country's big difficulties, and we resolutely obey the needs of the country."

### 学会筑炉技术　照样抬土担砖  武钢工地四百名青年工人自愿去做壮工

    学会筑炉技术　照样抬土担砖
    武钢工地四百名青年工人自愿去做壮工
    本报武汉11日电　武钢工地筑炉公司培训的四百名青年工人，已经于4月下旬分别到大冶钢厂工地、铁山工地和武钢厂区工地，挑泥土，搬砖头。到大冶钢厂工地的青工，头天就突破了定额，以后也平均超过定额20％左右。
    去年招收这批青年的时候，领导上曾讲过：“学习六个月后，就能考三级或四级技工。”许多学员都一心想着结业后当三级工，每月能挣四十多元，有的人计划提高工资后，给爱人买衣服。听到结业后没有工作任务，有的青工就要求继续学习，有的则表示当不上三级工就跳江自杀。
    公司党委和培训班支委会结合学习毛主席的讲话，分析了学员的情况，认为绝大多数学员都是劳动人民出身的，并且经过今年春季以来的勤俭建国的教育后，思想认识普遍提高，只要加强政治思想工作，讲清真实困难情况，他们是会自觉地去作普通工的。他们一开始就向这批青工传达了毛主席的讲话，并结合本公司情况作了增产节约的报告，指出结业后没有筑炉任务，当普通工也是建设社会主义，对国家有利。同时在工作中有一定的收入，对个人也有利。接着，又以请老工人讲述旧社会当学徒的痛苦等办法对他们进行艰苦奋斗的教育。
    经过这样一段教育后，青工们普遍反映：“过去学习六个月已用了国家很多钱，而自己对国家一点贡献都没有，就要求拿三级工的待遇，不应当。”“国家有困难，自己去挑土也是好的，不要再留下学习花更多的钱。”学员余行忠过去参加汉江分洪时，认为挑土很丢人，甩了扁担和铁钩，并将垫肩布撕下来做了短裤，发誓不再干挑土工作。他进培训班后，还写信给爱人讲自己以后是筑炉工了，再不会挑土。但经过这次教育后，特别是听说公司一些七八级的老师傅也在工地挑土。开始感到自己思想不对头。他爱人也回信批评他的想法，叫他不要忘了本。因此他也自动批判自己说：“我前几年还是个农民，怎么就说挑土不体面？”整个培训班小组的青工都写了保证书，表示“个人的小困难服从国家的大困难，坚决服从国家需要。”
