Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Voroshilov, who is currently visiting here, together reviewed the grand parade celebrating International Labor Day on the Tiananmen Gate tower today. 500,000 people in Beijing participated in the parade today, and the parading masses passed through Tiananmen Square for a total of three hours, constantly waving, cheering, and saluting the party and state leaders and distinguished guests on Tiananmen.

The parade was composed of eighty-four columns, advancing shoulder to shoulder in high spirits and in an orderly fashion.

At the very front of the procession were several huge banners with the words: "Long Live the Great Unity of the Working Class of the World!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long Live the Unity of the Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union!" "Work Hard and Build the Country with Diligence and Thrift!"

Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Voroshilov, Vice Chairman Rashidov, Chairman of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, Con Parvulescu, and Speaker of the Burmese Chamber of Nationalities, Sao Hkun Hkio, continuously applauded, waved, and tipped their hats to the parading masses from the Tiananmen Gate tower. On the square, thunderous cheers rose one after another, with people fervently shouting "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chairman Voroshilov!" "Long Live Peace!"

Also reviewing the parade on Tiananmen were Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, and other party and state leaders.

Mayor Peng Zhen extended holiday greetings to everyone in his speech at the celebration parade and expressed a warm welcome to guests from home and abroad.

The parade began after Peng Zhen's speech.

Some of the first groups of workers to pass through the square had been forming ranks and marching from the suburban factory districts since three o'clock in the morning. This year, the workers' ranks no longer displayed signs guaranteeing the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, but instead featured many charts showing the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, as well as slogans for increasing production and practicing economy. Many factory and enterprise signs displayed this year's targets for increasing production and practicing economy.

The farmers'队伍, arriving from the suburbs, carried eye-catching red banners with the words "Strive for a Bumper Harvest This Year." This procession was decorated with all kinds of models symbolizing the harvest, such as cotton, wheat, vegetables, and fruits. Farmers' representatives from eighteen provinces and regions, who are here to visit the agricultural exhibition, also brought charts showing the good harvests of their hometown crops to be reviewed today.

The scientists, students, and literary and art workers participating in the parade were in particularly high spirits today, holding high the banners and signs of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and "Marching Towards Science," they enthusiastically marched through Tiananmen Square. When the literary and art contingent passed through Tiananmen Square, they performed more than twenty kinds of music, dance, and drama programs, like a grand literary and art performance.

More than five thousand industrialists and businessmen in Beijing, who have accepted socialist transformation, also put on festive attire with great enthusiasm today and, along with their families, followed the ranks of the working people to be reviewed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

Red flags were hung everywhere in Beijing today, and music was broadcast over loudspeakers on the streets. The main streets of the entire eastern half of the city were adorned with the bright festive clothing worn by people, the colorful flowers of spring, and the red flags fluttering in the wind, creating a scene of vibrant colors. From a high vantage point, it looked like a colorful carpet stretching for dozens of miles.

Also participating in today's parade were children, members of handicraft production cooperatives, religious professionals of Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Catholicism, and other religions, citizens, sports teams, and contingents of government cadres.

The parading masses continuously waved to international friends on the viewing stand. Among the guests watching were people from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, as well as guests from friendly neighboring countries, the Aegean coast, hot Africa, and distant Latin America, totaling guests from all walks of life from forty-six countries.

After the sports team passed, the crowds in the square surged towards the Jinshui Bridge in front of Tiananmen. People waved bouquets and red flags, cheering enthusiastically. At this moment, festive fireworks and colorful balloons flew into the sky. The guests on the viewing stand also turned to Tiananmen. Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Voroshilov went to both sides of the Tiananmen Gate tower, frequently waving to the people. (Attached pictures)

    半个首都万紫千红五十万人盛大游行
    毛主席、伏罗希洛夫主席、帕伏列斯库主席、萧恢塔议长不断向群众鼓掌致意
    据新华社1日讯　毛泽东主席和正在这里访问的伏罗希洛夫主席今天一起站在天安门城楼上检阅了庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的盛大的游行队伍。北京今天有五十万人参加了游行，游行的群众通过天安门广场共历三个小时，他们接连不断地向站在天安门上的党和国家的领导人和贵宾们招手、欢呼。
    游行队伍由八十四路纵队组成，他们欢欣而有秩序地并肩前进。
    在队伍的最前面，排列着几个巨大的字标：“全世界工人阶级大团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国！”
    毛泽东主席和伏罗希洛夫主席、拉希多夫副主席、罗马尼亚大国民议会主席康·帕伏列斯库、缅甸民族院议长萧恢塔在天安门城楼上，不断地向游行群众鼓掌、招手和挥帽致意。广场上，暴风雨般的欢呼声一阵接一阵，人们狂热地高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“伏罗希洛夫主席万岁！”“和平万岁！”
    在天安门上检阅游行的还有刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云等党和国家的领导人。
    彭真市长在庆祝游行大会上的致词中向大家致节日的祝贺，向国内外的宾客们表示热烈欢迎。
    彭真讲话后，开始了游行。
    第一批通过广场的工人队伍，有些是从清晨三时就从市郊的工厂区整队赶来。今年的工人队伍中已经看不到保证提前完成五年计划的标牌，换上了许多已经提前完成五年计划的图表和增产节约的字标。很多工厂企业的标牌上写着今年增产节约的奋斗目标。
    从郊区赶来的农民队伍，拿着引人注目的“争取今年农业大丰收”的红色字标。这个队伍用了各色各样的象征丰收的棉花、小麦、蔬菜、水果等模型装饰起来。正在这里参观农业展览会的十八个省、区的农民代表，今天也带着自己家乡的农作物丰产图表来接受检阅。
    参加游行的科学工作者、学生和文艺工作者们，今天精神特别焕发，他们高举“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“向科学进军”等旗帜和字标，踊跃地穿过天安门广场。当文艺大队通过天安门广场时，他们表演了二十多种音乐、舞蹈和戏剧节目，好像是一场盛大的文艺会演。
    接受了社会主义改造的北京五千多个工商业者，今天也兴致勃勃地穿上节日的服装，同自己的家属一道，紧跟着劳动人民的队伍接受了毛泽东主席的检阅。
    北京全城今天到处挂起红旗，街头广播器放送着音乐。整个东半城各条主要街道被人们穿着的鲜艳的节日服装、春天的各色花朵、迎风招展的红旗点缀得万紫千红，从高处看去，如同铺了几十里长的彩色地毯。
    参加今天游行的还有少年儿童，手工业生产合作社社员，佛教、道教、基督教、天主教等各种宗教职业者，市民，体育大队和机关干部的队伍。
    游行群众不断向观礼台上的国际朋友挥手致意。观礼的客人中，有的来自苏联和人民民主国家，有的来自友邻各国、爱琴海畔、炎热的非洲和遥远的拉丁美洲，共有四十六个国家的各方面的客人。
    体育大队通过后，广场上的人群拥向天安门金水桥前。人们挥舞着花束和红旗，热烈欢呼。这时，节日的礼花、各色气球飞上天空。观礼台上的客人们也转向天安门。毛泽东主席和伏罗希洛夫主席到天安门城楼两侧向人们频频招手。（附图片）
