Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: The reporter learned from the National Provincial and Municipal Company Managers Meeting of the China Coal Construction Company, which closed today, that this year there will be difficulties in increasing national coal production. It is necessary to save coal from various aspects and arrange the market reasonably in order to guarantee the need for winter coal this year.

The tight supply of coal in the market was already apparent last year. This year, the amount of coal planned to be supplied to the market by the state has not only not increased proportionally, but has decreased by 2.21 million tons compared with last year.

The fundamental way to ease the tight supply of coal in the market is to increase production and save resources. At present, the coal industry departments are taking various measures to increase coal production. It is estimated that the national coal production this year will increase by 11.48% compared with 1956. The state also plans to purchase more than 10 million tons of coal from small kilns this year. At present, the potential for increasing production of small-kiln coal in various places is still very large.

In terms of saving resources, there is great potential in both urban and rural areas. For urban domestic coal use, the highest average is about three catties per person per day, and the lowest average is more than four taels. In terms of coal used for heating, it is possible for general urban agencies and enterprises to save 20%.

In rural areas, if each farmer family in the country picks up 200 catties more firewood, it is equivalent to saving 1.4 million tons of coal. Thirteen provinces have now formulated various plans to save coal, which can save 1.5 million tons of coal for the country this year.

The meeting pointed out that in order to alleviate the tight supply of coal in the market, in addition to increasing production and saving resources from various aspects, reasonable arrangement of supply work is also an important aspect. It is necessary to investigate market needs, classify them according to priority and urgency, and rank them accordingly.

The fundamental reason for the tight supply of coal in the market is that the growth rate of coal industry production cannot keep up with the ever-increasing speed of people's lives. In 1956, the national coal production increased by more than 63.4% compared with 1952, while the coal demand increased by 109% compared with 1952, which was half faster than the production growth rate.

From the perspective of market needs, the growth rate of domestic coal is faster than that of industry. Among domestic coal, the growth rate of domestic coal in rural areas is faster than that in cities. In 1956, the supply of coal to rural areas increased by more than 91% compared with 1952, and the supply of coal to cities increased by 78.6%.

    及早安排冬季用煤
    据新华社23日讯　记者从今天闭幕的中国煤建公司全国省市公司经理会议上获悉：今年国家煤炭增产有困难，必须从多方面节约煤炭和合理的安排市场才能保证今年冬季用煤的需要。
    煤炭市场供应紧张，早在去年就已显露出来。今年国家计划供应市场的煤炭数量不但没有按比例增加，反比去年减少二百二十一万吨。
    缓和市场煤炭供应紧张的根本办法是增产节约，现在煤炭工业部门正在采取多种措施增产煤炭，预计今年全国煤炭产量将比1956年增长11.48％。今年国家还计划收购小窑煤一千多万吨。目前各地小窑煤增产潜力还很大。
    在节约方面，城乡都有很大的潜力。城市生活用煤，最高的每人每天平均约三斤，最低的平均四两多。在烤火用煤方面，一般的城市机关、企业节约20％是可能的。
    在农村方面，如果全国每个农户多拾二百斤柴草，等于节省一百四十万吨煤炭。现在已有十三个省订出多种节约煤炭的计划，今年共可为国家节约一百五十万吨煤炭。
    会议指出：缓和市场煤炭供应紧张，除了从多方面增产节约外，合理的安排供应工作也是一个重要方面。必须调查市场需要，根据轻重缓急，分类排队。
    煤炭市场供应紧张的根本原因，是煤炭工业生产增长速度赶不上人民生活日益增长的速度。1956年全国煤炭产量比1952年增长了63.4％以上，而煤炭需要量比1952年增长了109％，比生产增长的速度快了一半。
    从市场需要来看，生活用煤增长速度快于工业，在生活用煤中，农村生活用煤增长速度快于城市，1956年供应农村用煤比1952年增长91％以上，城市用煤增长78.6％。
