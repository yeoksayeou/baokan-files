Blake's Poetry Excerpts
Translated by Tu An

    Infant Joy
    “I have no name;
    I am but two days old.”
    What shall I call thee?
    “I happy am;
    Joy is my name.”
    Sweet joy befall thee!

    Pretty Joy!
    Sweet joy but two days old,
    Sweet joy I call thee;
    Thou dost smile,
    I sing the while,
    Sweet joy befall thee!

    Love's Secret
    Never seek to tell thy love,
    Love that never told can be;
    For the gentle wind does move
    Silently, invisibly.
    I told my love, I told my love,
    I told her all my heart,
    Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears.
    Ah! she did depart!

    Soon after she was gone from me,
    A traveller came by,
    Silently, invisibly:
    He took her with a sigh.

    The Lamb
    Little Lamb, who made thee?
    Dost thou know who made thee?
    Gave thee life, and bid thee feed.
    By the stream and o'er the mead;
    Gave thee clothing of delight,
    Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
    Gave thee such a tender voice,
    Making all the vales rejoice?

    Little Lamb, who made thee?
    Dost thou know who made thee?

    Little Lamb, I'll tell thee;
    Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:
    He is called by thy name,
    For he calls himself a Lamb:
    He is meek, and he is mild;
    He became a little child:
    I a child, and thou a lamb,
    We are called by his name.
    Little Lamb, God bless thee.
    Little Lamb, God bless thee.

    A Poison Tree
    I was angry with my friend:
    I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
    I was angry with my foe:
    I told it not, my wrath did grow.

    And I watered it in fears,
    Night and morning with my tears;
    And I sunned it with smiles
    And with soft deceitful wiles.

    And it grew both day and night,
    Till it bore an apple bright.
    And my foe beheld it shine,
    And he knew that it was mine,

    And into my garden stole
    When the night had veiled the pole;
    In the morning glad I see
    My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

    [Translator's Note] William Blake was an early (18th century) English Romantic poet and painter. This year marks the bicentennial of his birth. He is one of the world cultural figures whom the World Peace Council has called upon us to commemorate this year. His works are filled with mysticism and religious overtones. The poems selected and translated here are fairly representative of his style (the "He" in the poem "The Lamb" refers to God). His poems often contain profound philosophical ideas and are rich in imaginative colors. Artistically, he is highly original and a maverick in the English poetry world.

    勃雷克诗钞
    屠岸译
    婴儿欢喜“我没有名字；
    我生下来只有两天。”
    ——我唤你什么呢？
    “我很快乐；我的名字叫‘欢喜’。”
    ——愿你有甜蜜的欢喜！
    可爱的欢喜！
    甜蜜的欢喜，但生下来只有两天；
    我叫你甜蜜的欢喜；
    你确是笑了；
    我始终唱着，
    愿你有甜蜜的欢喜！
    爱的秘密
    永远不要对你的爱人说出来，
    爱情可永远不能说明；要知道温和的风总是静静地，无形地移动。我对我爱人说了，我对我爱人说了，我对她倾诉了我整个的心怀，一面发抖，发冷，在剧烈的恐惧中：——
  啊！她竟然走开。一位漫游者走来，
  在她离我不久之后，静静地，无形地，
  他轻叹一声，把她带走。
    羔羊
    小羔羊，谁造你的？
    你可知道谁造你的？谁给你生命，叫你吃草的——在溪边吃，边吃边过绿草地；还给你好看的衣裳，最最细腻的，柔软又光亮，还给你这么个软嗓音，叫所有的山谷都喜欢听？
    小羔羊，谁造你的？
    你可知道谁造你的？
    小羔羊，我告诉你吧，
    小羔羊，我告诉你吧：他的名字跟你一样，因为他称自己叫羔羊；他是既谦逊又和蔼，他成了一个小孩。我是小孩，你是羔羊，我们的名字跟他的一样。
    小羔羊，上帝祝福你啊，
    小羔羊，上帝祝福你啊。
      毒树
    我对朋友发怒：
    对他说了，怒气就消除。
    我对仇人发火，
    不对他说，火气就加多。
    我日夜在恐怖里
    用眼泪浇那火气；
    又晒它，用微笑
    和温软骗人的计巧。
    它就日夜生长，
    最后结出一只苹果，发出
        光芒；
    我的仇人看见了那果子在
        闪熠，
    他也知道那果子是我的—等到黑夜隐蔽了苍天，他就偷进了我的果园：早晨，我高兴地见到他僵挺在那棵树底下。
    〔译者附志〕威廉·勃雷克（William Blake）是英国早期（十八世纪）浪漫派诗人兼画家，今年是他诞生二百周年纪念，他是世界和平理事会号召我们今年纪念的世界文化名人之一。他的作品充满了神秘主义的和宗教的气息，这里所选译的几首诗，正是比较能代表他的风格的（“羔羊”一诗中的“他”是指上帝）。他的诗也往往含有精深的哲理，带有丰富的幻想色彩，在艺术上非常富于独创性，他是英国诗坛上的一位怪杰。
