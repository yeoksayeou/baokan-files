    Britain's Severe Housing Shortage
    Even the Poor Cannot Find Shelter in Caves

    (Our London Dispatch) Although the British government has built some houses since the war, the housing shortage is far from being resolved, so that even today some people have to rent caves to live in.

    On May 7, Mrs. Lily House of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was sued in court for owing sixteen pounds in rent. She told the judge about her living conditions: she, her husband, and four children live together in a cave. The cave is located on a steep slope, and there is no water or electricity inside. The only source of light is sunlight. Even so, she has to pay a rent of six shillings a week. She said, "We can only live in this cave because we have nowhere else to go, and my husband can't find work." The court finally ruled that the municipal government would confiscate the cave for three months. However, if Mrs. House can pay the weekly rent as usual and repay the arrears of four shillings per week, the judgment will not be enforced.

    英国房荒严重
    穷人借石洞栖身也不可得
    本报伦敦电　虽然英国政府自战后以来，曾经修建了一些民房，但是房荒问题仍然远远未能满意解决，以致今天还有人不得不租住石洞。
    5月7日，华塞斯特郡启特尔明斯特市的莉丽·豪斯夫人因欠房租十六镑而被告到法庭。她对法官陈述她的居宅情况说：她和她的丈夫、四个孩子共住在一个石洞里。这个石洞位于一个陡坡上，洞内无水电设备，唯一的光线来源是阳光。就这样，她每周必须缴纳房租六先令。她说，我们只能住在这个石洞里，因为我们无处可去，而我的丈夫又找不到工作。最后法庭判决市政府将石洞充公三个月。但是如果豪斯夫人能够照常交付每周房租并且每周偿还所欠房租四先令，就不执行这判决。
