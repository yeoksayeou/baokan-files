Peking University’s Rectification Begins to Deepen

    Our Newspaper reports On the afternoon of May 17th, the Peking University Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited the heads of the various democratic parties within the university, the chairman of the Trade Union Committee, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, and the chairman of the Student Union to a discussion. The purpose was to discuss further mobilizing the masses to examine the shortcomings and errors of the University Party Committee's past leadership and to help the Party organization rectify its work style.

    At the start of the discussion, Jiang Longji, the person in charge of the University Party Committee, said that rectification had already begun with the previous convening of a symposium for all faculty, staff, and student representatives to expose problems in the university's work. In the previous stage, a total of three or four small meetings and six large meetings were held. He provided a preliminary analysis of the criticisms and opinions raised by everyone at the previous symposium. Regarding those matters that had been clarified as mistakes made by the University Party Committee in its leadership, he admitted the errors in a spirit of self-criticism. For example, during the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movement, due to insufficient investigation and research, Mr. Gu Muding of the Chinese Department and Mr. Liu Zhenying of the Department of Eastern Languages were wrongly struggled against at a university-wide meeting. He said that after the matter was clarified, their reputations were not restored at a university-wide meeting. He said that all comrades who had been wrongly struggled against in the past movements should have their reputations restored at the same type of meeting. The leadership should also publicly admit their mistakes and apologize to the wrongly struggled comrades. Another example was the opinion raised that the university leadership had not paid enough attention to the Library Science Department, International Relations History, and the Psychology major in the past, preventing people with expertise in these areas from发挥的作用. He said that this problem existed and would be studied and resolved in the future. Some people also commented that the work arrangements for some professors were inappropriate, such as Professor Jin Kemu of the Department of Eastern Languages, who specialized in Indian philosophy and literature but was assigned to teach Indian Urdu; Professor Zhou Zumo of the Chinese Department, whose expertise was not necessarily entirely in modern Chinese, but was only assigned to teach modern Chinese… Jiang Longji said that these opinions were correct, and that inappropriate work arrangements for individuals also existed among other professors or teaching staff and should be actively addressed. He stated that all criticisms and opinions raised by everyone regarding working and living conditions, the university's ethos, democratic life, and the university's systems should be addressed by implementing the spirit of "improving while examining," actively seeking to improve them, and encouraging everyone to continue exposing and criticizing the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism that existed in the University Party Committee's leadership.

    In order to further mobilize the masses to expose more shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the University Party Committee, the meeting determined that, from now until the summer vacation, the movement would still focus on soliciting opinions from the party member leading cadres at the university level when discussing the current steps in the rectification. Only then would the rectification of ordinary party members begin. During this period before the summer vacation, the University Party Committee decided to separately convene symposia for faculty, staff, and student representatives, and also instructed the general party branches of each department to convene similar symposia to fully promote democracy, enabling everyone to speak their minds freely, give full play to their initiative, and help the Party leadership overcome shortcomings and run the school well.

    At the meeting, participants spoke enthusiastically and expressed many opinions regarding further research on what the focus of the university's rectification should be and how to ensure that rectification and work were not hindered. Zhao Zhenjiang, chairman of the Student Union, said: It is hoped that the student symposium can be held earlier, as the student exam period is approaching. It is necessary to help the Party in rectification and not delay studies, and time should be arranged appropriately.

    做错了的就承认错误　能解决的就积极解决
    北京大学整风开始深入
    本报讯　17日下午，中共北京大学党委会邀请校内各民主党派负责人、工会委员会主席、团委书记、学生会主席座谈，讨论进一步发动群众，检查学校党委过去领导工作的缺点和错误，帮助党组织整风。
    座谈开始，学校党委会负责人江隆基说，从上一次召开全校教职员工及学生代表座谈会，揭发学校工作中的问题时，就已开始整风。前一阶段共开了三、四次小会，六次大会。他对于前次座谈会上大家所提的批评和意见，作了初步分析。凡已弄清楚那些是校党委领导上做错了的，就以自我批评精神，承认错误。如在“肃反”运动中，由于调查研究不够，曾经在全校大会上错斗了中文系顾牧丁和东语系刘振颖两位先生。问题弄清楚以后，也没有在全校大会上恢复他们的名誉。他说，凡是过去在运动中被错斗了的同志，均应在同样的会议上替他们恢复名誉。领导上也应该当众承认错误，并向被错斗的同志道歉。又如有些人提意见说，由于过去学校领导上对图书馆学系、国际关系史、心理专业等重视不够，使在这方面有专长的人不能发挥作用。他说，这问题是存在的，今后要研究解决。又如有些人提意见，对有些教授的工作安排不当，如东语系教授金克木，他擅长印度哲学和印度文学，而让他去教印度巫尔都文；中文系教授周祖谟，他擅长不一定全在于现代汉语，而只让他教现代汉语……。江隆基说，这些意见是正确的，对个人工作安排不当的情况，在其他教授或其他教学人员中也存在，应该积极设法解决。其他如大家对于工作和生活条件、学校校风、民主生活、学校制度等各方面所提的批评和意见，他都表示要贯彻边检查边改进的精神，积极设法改进，并鼓励大家继续对校党委领导上所存在的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义进行揭发和批评。
    为了进一步发动群众更多的揭发校党委领导方面的缺点和错误，会议在讨论安排当前整风步骤时，确定从目前直到暑假以前，运动仍集中对校一级党员领导干部提意见。以后，才开始一般党员的整风。在暑假以前这一期间，校党委决定分头召开教职员工及学生代表座谈会，同时，也责成各系党总支分头召开同样对象的座谈会，充分发扬民主，使大家畅所欲言，发挥大家的积极性，帮助党领导克服缺点，办好学校。
    会上，参加座谈的人都踊跃发言，对于进一步研究学校整风到底应以什么为重点问题和整风与工作两不误问题，发表了很多意见。学生会主席赵震江说：学生座谈会希望能提前进行，因学生考期逼近，既要帮助党整风，又不能耽误学习，时间要安排恰当。
