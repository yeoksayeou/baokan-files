    Returning to the Countryside to Farm
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 3rd) Basic construction units in the Xi'an area have been mobilizing surplus temporary workers to return to their villages to participate in agricultural production. From the end of last year to mid-April of this year, more than 40,000 people have returned to the countryside.
    Starting at the end of last year, all construction units have made mobilizing surplus temporary workers to return to their hometowns to participate in production one of their central tasks. They based their approach on the different situations of the temporary workers, first mobilizing temporary workers whose homes were in the rural areas of the province, and then mobilizing those whose homes were in other provinces; first mobilizing workers whose contracts had expired, and then mobilizing those whose contracts had not yet expired. Temporary workers whose homes were in cities such as Shanghai were generally not mobilized. During the mobilization, all units praised the temporary workers for their enthusiastic labor in their work, and also explained to them that this year's construction tasks had been reduced, and there would be no work for the temporary workers to do, which would inevitably lead to a large amount of wasted labor. Moreover, after agricultural cooperation, cultivation has become more detailed, and the number of economic crops has increased, requiring more manpower. If they return to participate in agricultural production, it will benefit both the country and themselves. After mobilization, the vast majority of temporary workers were willing to return home to produce. For individual workers who were unwilling to return home, they were temporarily allowed to continue production while being persuaded to return to their hometowns; forced orders were resolutely avoided. For temporary workers whose hometowns were far from Xi'an, the units provided sufficient travel expenses and food allowances. All returning workers were issued certificates of discharge, proving that these workers had successfully completed their task of supporting basic construction. Many cadres in the work areas also packed luggage for the returning workers and personally sent them to the train station. Therefore, it was generally achieved that those who returned were satisfied and those who remained were at ease. Many temporary workers said that they would work hard to improve agricultural production after returning home.

    回乡种地
    本报西安3日电　西安地区各基本建设单位动员多余的临时工人回家参加农业生产，从去年年底到今年4月中旬，已经有四万余人回到农村去了。
    从去年年底开始，各建筑单位都将动员多余的临时工人回乡参加生产作为中心工作之一。他们根据临时工的不同情况，先动员家在本省农村的临时工人，然后动员家在外省的；先动员合同期满的工人，再动员合同没到期的。对家在上海等城市的临时工人，一般不动员。在动员时，各单位都表扬了临时工们工作中的热情劳动，并且对他们讲清今年的建设任务有所削减，临时工没有活可作，势必造成大量窝工；而农业合作化以后，耕作更细致了，经济作物增加多了，需要更多的人力，如果他们回去参加农业生产，对国家对自己都有好处。经过动员，绝大部分临时工人都愿意回家生产。对个别不愿回家的工人，一面暂时让他们生产，一面说服他们回家乡去，坚决不强迫命令。对家乡距离西安较远的临时工，各单位都发了足够的路费和伙食费。对所有回乡工人，全部发给退工证明书，证明这些工人已经胜利完成了支援基本建设的任务。很多工区的干部还给回家的工人打行李，亲自送他们到火车站。因此，基本上作到了回家的满意，留下来的安心。很多临时工都表示，回去后一定要努力搞好农业生产。
