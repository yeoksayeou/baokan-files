	Older Brother		Huì Mǐn
	I am very lucky to have a good older brother.
	My brother doesn't like to talk. The young men gave him the nickname "Big Girl." He is good at needlework. If his pants or cloth shirts are torn, he never asks anyone for help. He finds a needle and thread himself, and sews them up tightly, with neat stitches. One day, my brother wore his patched cloth shirt to the fair. Before he even left the village entrance, he ran into a group of girls, followed by Auntie Liu, who grabbed my brother's arm, pointed at the patch, and showed the girls: "Look, how skillful this man is! Humph! Good enough to compete with you girls." My brother's face turned as red as Guan Yu's. The girls giggled.
	Seeing my brother after so many years, I felt particularly close to him, asking him all sorts of questions. I asked my brother if he had a girlfriend. My mother said, "Your brother doesn't want a wife. He wants to be a bachelor for life!" My brother didn't say anything, and after a long while, he said, "Humph, who needs a wife? It's better to live alone."
	My brother is a bit slow. One day in the culture class, during arithmetic class, the teacher asked him what seven plus eight was. He had to count on his fingers, making everyone burst into laughter. Since then, he asked my mother for an ounce of lamp oil. My mother asked him what he needed the oil for. He smiled and said: "Humph! It's useful!" My mother, sharp-eyed, saw a dog-eared book tucked under his arm; she said with a smile: "Good! Study hard! Learn a few more characters, and help your father keep the tofu accounts." My mother took out a brightly polished lamp, filled it with oil, and handed it to my brother.
	The night was pitch black, and the sky was full of stars. A glimmer of light shone from my brother's window, shining until the rooster crowed. After that, he needed lamp oil every night. At the end of the year examination, he received a model student award. My mother said with a smile: "Look, my Chūnzhù got a study award!"
	My mother told me many more stories about my brother.
	"That day was as hot as a steamer, and people couldn't catch their breath. The team asked your brother and Èrzhù to push manure to the Nánwān field. Each person had to push fifty cartloads a day. Your brother didn't say a word, and started pushing the cart. Those foolish young men loading the manure loaded your brother's cart full to the brim, and asked him if he could push it. Your brother said: 'Humph! It wouldn't matter if you loaded it with more!' He grabbed the handle and pushed it away! Before dark, your brother finished pushing his pile of manure, and Èrzhù still had ten or so cartloads left! Your brother said, 'Hey! Èrzhù, you have to worship me as your teacher!' As he said this, he helped Èrzhù push."
	"Your brother's drive and kindness are well-loved. People like 'Mumbling' Grandpa Bǎochéng, Grandpa Dǒng Èr, Uncle Wáng Dà… all praise him. Uncle Wáng, during festivals, always asks your brother to eat whatever good food they make at home. Sometimes, when your brother is not home, Uncle asks his wife to save some for him. Your brother has indeed helped his family a lot. That year, during the wheat harvest, nobody was home at Grandpa Dǒng Èr's house, so your brother spent the night helping him cut all the wheat, thresh it, dry it, and carry it home. Last spring, when the village established a higher-level cooperative, 'Mumbling' Grandpa Bǎochéng didn't want to join, afraid of losing out. Later, he listened to your brother's advice and joined the cooperative. This year, the crops were abundant, and his family received more grain than he could remember ever receiving since he was a child. He happily patted your brother's shoulder and said: 'If it weren't for this child advising me, how could this old fool have so much grain!'"
	Just as I was leaving that morning, the cooperative held a labor model awards conference. I went too. My brother was awarded the first prize. The cooperative leader personally awarded my brother the fifteen yuan bonus wrapped in red cloth. At this time, my mother was in the crowd, watching my brother receive the award, so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. The old neighbor Grandma Dǒng said: "Auntie! You raised two good children, one who is an officer in the army, and one who is a model worker. You will enjoy a good life later!" Grandma Dǒng, wearing her reading glasses, leaned over and said: "Yes! And soon, your Chūnzhù will find a partner, get married, and you, Auntie, will be waiting to hold your grandson!..." She wanted to say more, but a burst of laughter came from the back of the crowd, interrupting her. It turned out a group of girls were surrounding a girl with two short braids, wearing a blue blouse with pink flowers, teasing her. Grandma Dǒng and everyone turned around to look. It was Yùméi, the daughter of Uncle Zhāng Dà.
	"When did you two start dating?" "Chūnzhù got a fifteen-yuan bonus, how much will he share with you?" "Sister Yùméi, have you and Chūnzhù set a lucky date for the wedding?" "..." A series of questions and chaotic laughter made Yùméi—a very pretty girl—blush bright red. She immediately covered her face with a handkerchief. Originally, her and my brother's love was unknown to the whole village, but Yùméi was careless and put the handkerchief she embroidered for my brother and a letter she wrote in her blouse pocket. When she got hot from working, she took it off and hung it on a tree, and it was stolen by the "busybody" Lán Yīng.
	At this moment, my mother turned her face to look at Yùméi, then looked at my brother, sitting red-faced on the stage. She understood everything, and her heart was as happy as if it had bloomed, and she said with a smile: "This child is looking for a partner, and didn't even tell her mother."
	On the way back, I asked my brother: "When will I be able to drink your and Yùméi's wedding wine?"
	My brother just looked at me and smiled, his face red again.

    哥哥	慧敏
    我很幸运，有个好哥哥。
    哥哥不爱说话，小伙子给他起个外号叫“大姑娘”。他会做一手好针线活，他穿的裤子、布衫，要是烂了，他从不央求人家，自己找一根针、一条线，缝得密密麻麻的，针脚很整齐。一天，哥哥穿着补好的布衫去赶会，没走出村口，就碰上一群姑娘，后面跟着的刘大嫂，一把捞住哥哥的胳膊，指着补丁给姑娘们看：“你看，人家男人手多巧。咦！蛮敢和您这帮丫头比比”。哥哥的脸红得像关爷，姑娘们吃吃的笑。
    我见了分别多年的哥哥，感到格外亲热，问长问短，我问哥哥有没有对象？娘说：“你哥不要媳妇啦，想打一辈子光棍哩！”哥哥不做声，半天才说：“哼，要啥媳妇，一个人过着怪利索。”
    哥哥有些笨。一天文化班上算术课，教员问他七加八是多少，他要扳着手指算，惹得大家哄堂大笑。自那回以后，他问娘要一两灯油，娘问他要油干啥，他笑了笑说： “哼！有用嘛！”娘眼尖，看见他胳肢窝下夹着一本卷边的书；笑着说：“好！学吧！多识几个字，替你爹记记豆腐账。”娘腾了一个擦得明晃晃的灯，装上满满的油，递给哥哥。
    夜，黑洞洞的，天空布满了星星。哥哥的窗缝射出一丝亮光，一直亮到鸡叫。此后，他晚晚都要灯油。到年终考试，他获得了学习模范奖状。娘笑呵呵的说：“看，俺春柱得了学习奖状哩！”
    娘又跟我讲哥哥好些故事。
   “那天热的像蒸笼一样，人都上不来气，队里叫你哥和二柱往南湾地里推粪。要每人一天推五十车子。你哥也不吭气，驾起车子就走了。那些装粪的二乎小伙子给你哥装了满满一大车，问他推动推不动，你哥说：‘哼！再装多些也没啥！’抓住车把就推走了！不到天黑，你哥那堆粪推光了，二柱那堆还有十来车子哩！你哥说：‘嘿！二柱你得拜我做老师呀！’说着就帮二柱推。”
   “你哥的干劲儿和好心眼，挺得人爱。像‘胡噜’保成爷、董二爷、王大伯……都夸他好。王大伯逢年过节，家里做啥好吃的，还叫哥去吃。有时哥不在家，大伯就叫伯母给留着。你哥也着实给他家帮了很多的忙。那年收麦，董二爷家没人，哥哥就赶夜帮他把麦子割完，打完、晒干、背回家去。去年春天，村里成立高级社，‘胡噜’保成爷不想入社，恐怕吃亏，后来听了哥哥的话，入了社。今年庄稼丰收，他家分的粮比他从记事起算来的都多，喜的拍拍你哥肩膀说：
  ‘要不是这孩子劝我，我这老糊涂那能有这么多的粮食！？”
    正好，我走那天头午，社里召开了奖励劳动模范大会。我也去了。哥哥被评为头奖，社长亲自把红布包着的十五元奖金奖给哥哥。这时娘在人群里，看着哥哥得了奖，乐得嘴都合不上，邻居大奶奶说：“她婶子！你养了两个好儿女，一个在军队上当军官，一个又是模范，以后多享福呀！”戴着老花眼镜的董二奶奶也伸过身子来说：“是呀！再迟些时，你的春柱再找个对象，结了婚，他婶子静等着抱孙子吧！……”她还想说，但是人群后边传来一阵乱笑声，打断了她的话头。原来一群姑娘围住一个扎了两条短辫子、穿一身蓝地粉花袄的姑娘，正在逗趣她哩。董二奶和大家回头一看，这是张老大伯的姑娘玉梅。
   “你们啥时候谈恋爱的？”“春柱哥得了十五元奖金，他能分给你多少？”“玉梅妹，你和春柱说定那个吉祥日子结婚？”“……”一阵追问和杂乱的笑声，把个玉梅——一个挺俊气的姑娘羞得脸通红通红，马上用一条手帕把脸遮上了。本来，她和哥恋爱，全村谁也不知道，谁知玉梅不小心，把给哥绣的手帕和写的一封信，装在上衣布袋里，干活热了脱下来，挂在树上，给“好事精”兰英偷去了。
    这时娘扭过脸去，看看玉梅，又看看坐在台上红脸的哥哥，一切都明白了，心里乐得像开了花，笑着说：“这孩子找对象，连娘也不给说一声。”
    回来的路上，我问哥哥：“什么时候我能喝上你和玉梅的喜酒？”
    哥哥光瞧着我笑，脸又红了。
