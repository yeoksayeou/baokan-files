Editing Recollections
-- Regarding the "World Short Story Series"	Zhao Jiabi
    Among the several editing projects in my editing career that were stillborn midway, there was a set of books that could be said to have almost reached full term before dying in the womb. Advance copies had been printed, advertisements had been published, and it was expected that the books would begin to be published in three months, but the August 13th Incident in 1937, when Japanese imperialism provoked the war of aggression in Shanghai, strangled it alive. Now, only a few large packages of proofs, manuscripts, and selections remain by my side, while four of the ten compilers have passed away one after another.
    It was in the autumn of 1935, when the "China New Literature Series" began to be published, that I took a set of sample books to give to Mr. Cai Yuanpei, who wrote the general preface. After stroking the set of books for a long time, he expressed the following wish to me: "If the sales of this book are not bad after publication, you can continue to compile the second phase; but personally, I think it is more important to compile a collection of translated works. If there had been no excellent Western works introduced to China during the May Fourth period, the creation of new literature would not have achieved its current results. The seeds left by those who engaged in translation work at that time are equally worthy of being cherished by future generations; the difficulty is that the situation of these works being scattered and lost is even more difficult to deal with than this book." The old man's suggestion immediately aroused another dream of mine. However, the scope of translated literature is as vast as the sea, with a long history, many countries, and even more writers. How to find a focus to compile and select became a difficult problem.
    At that time, Kawade Shobo in Tokyo was publishing a seven-volume "Complete Collection of World Short Story Masterpieces". The editorial department of Liangyou Book Company, where I worked, regularly received its publication monthly report. Looking at the translated works in our country since the "May Fourth" period, short stories accounted for the largest proportion, and they had a deeper impact on our new literary movement; and the short story is a literary form that has developed over the past hundred years, and it can best reflect the lives and thoughts of modern people. After many discussions between the editorial department and the writers, it was decided to take the short story as the scope of compilation and selection, and named it "World Short Story Series", divided into ten volumes. Because the editing method, intention, format, and length are quite similar to the "China New Literature Series", it is called the "sister series of the China New Literature Series".
    This series is divided into three parts in terms of editing methods: the introduction mainly summarizes the history of the development of short stories in this country and its characteristics, and also talks about the process of being introduced to China and its impact on Chinese creative literature. The works section is arranged in chronological order, with one to three representative works selected for each representative writer, accompanied by a portrait and a short biography of the author. It mainly selects from the translated works since the "May Fourth" period, and new translations are made by the compilers for those that should be introduced but have not been translated or are poorly translated. At the end of the book, there are two appendices, one is a complete list or index of the works of this country that have been translated into Chinese since the "May Fourth" period, and the other is a complete list of the original works of the selected writers.
    After this plan was decided, it quickly received the support and cooperation of translators and foreign literature researchers. Mr. A Ying, who has the richest collection of translated works, was willing to give us the greatest encouragement in providing information assistance, because the compilation materials would be provided by the Liangyou Editorial Department. By the spring of 1937, ten compilers had been appointed, and it was expected that the books would begin to be published at the end of the year and completed in 1939. Mr. Cai Yuanpei also submitted a short preface in June. The preface said:
   "The translation collection of short stories began thirty years ago with the 'Collection from Abroad' by the Zhou Shuren (Lu Xun) and Zhou Zuoren brothers, but there has been no successor for a long time. In the past ten years, collections of world short stories, selected world short story masterpieces, modern novel translation series, and short story translation collections from France, Germany, England, Russia, Poland, Spain, Japan, etc., have been published, adding a little new stimulation to the literary world. However, each follows its own preferences and does not consult with each other, and it still cannot give us a comprehensive impression. Liangyou Book Company has newly compiled a "World Short Story Series", taking the translated versions, re-examining them, selecting qualified translations, and supplementing them with newly translated representative works. In addition, it adds the development history of short stories in various countries, biographies of famous writers, and an index of translations in the past ten years, which not only gives a general introduction to the past short story world, but also has a good influence on future short stories!"
    Among the ten volumes, England, America, France, Germany, and Japan each occupy one volume. Compilers: Mr. Fu Donghua for the "English Collection", Mr. Li Liewen for the "French Collection", Mr. Zheng Boqi for the "Japanese Collection", and I myself made up the number for the "American Collection". When editing the "China New Literature Series" the year before, Mr. Guo Moruo was originally invited to compile the "Poetry Collection", but due to the unreasonable obstruction of the Kuomintang reactionary review committee, it did not materialize; later, Zhu Ziqing was invited instead. This time, we firmly strived to have Mr. Guo undertake the compilation of the "German Collection". Mr. Guo, who lived in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, initially declined due to being busy, and recommended Mr. Zong Baihua to take the position, and even wrote us a letter of introduction to find him; but after our sincere request, he finally agreed.

    编辑忆旧
    ——关于世界短篇小说大系	赵家璧
    我在编辑生涯中中途流产的几个编辑计划里，有一套书是可以说将近临盆而夭折在母胎里的。预约样本已付印，广告已刊登，预计三个月后，就可以开始出书，但是1937年日本帝国主义在上海挑起的八·一三侵略战争把它活活扼死了。如今只留下几大包清样、原稿、选目在我身边，而十位编选人中倒有四位已先后作了古人。
    那是“中国新文学大系”开始出书的1935年秋天，我带了一套样书去送给写总序的蔡元培先生。他把这套书抚摩良久后，向我说出了如下的愿望：“假如这部书出版后销路不坏，你们很可以继续地编第二期；但是我个人认为比这更重要的是翻译作品的结集。“五四”时代假如没有西洋的优秀作品被介绍到中国来，新文学的创作事业就不会获得目前的成绩。当时从事翻译工作的人，他们所留下的种子是同样值得后人珍视的；困难的是这些作品散佚的情形，比这部书更难着手去整理罢了。”老人家的建议立刻引起了我的又一个梦想。但是翻译文学范围浩如烟海，历史长，国家多，作家更多，如何找个重点来编选倒是一个难题。
    当时东京河出书房正在出版一套七卷本的“世界短篇杰作全集”。我所工作的良友图书公司编辑部经常收到它的出版月报。再看看我国“五四”以来翻译作品中以短篇小说比重最大，它对我们的新文学运动影响较深；而短篇小说又是近百年来发展的文学形式，最能反映现代人的生活和思想。经过编辑部和作家们的很多次商讨，便决定以短篇小说为编选范围，取名“世界短篇小说大系”，分出十卷。因为编辑方法和意图以及开本、篇幅与“中国新文学大系”颇有相似之处，称之为“中国新文学大系的姊妹篇”。
    这套大系在编辑方法上分三个部分：导言主要概述这个国家短篇小说发展的历史和它的特点，兼谈介绍到中国来的经过和对中国创作文学发生的影响。作品部分按年代先后，每一代表作家选一至三篇代表作，冠以作者像和短传。主要从“五四”以来已译作品中挑选，应介绍而没有译或译得不好的由编选者新译。书末有两个附录，一个是“五四”以来这个国家的作品已译成中文的全目或索引，一个是入选作家原作的全目。
    这个计划决定后，很快得到了翻译家和外国文学研究者的支持和合作。收藏翻译作品最丰富的阿英先生愿意在资料上大力协助给了我们最大的鼓励，因为编选材料都将由良友编辑部负责供应的。1937年春天已把十位编选人约定了，预计年底开始出书，1939年内完成。蔡元培先生也在6月中把短序交来。序文中说：
   “短篇小说的译集始于三十年前周树人（鲁迅）作人昆弟的域外集，但好久没有继起的。最近十年，始有世界短篇小说集、世界短篇杰作选、现代小说译丛与法、德、英、俄、波兰、西班牙、日本等短篇小说译集出版，在文学界狠添一点新激刺。但各从所好，不相为谋，还不能给我们一个综合的印象。良友图书公司新编一部世界短篇小说大系，取已译的本，重加审核，选取合格的译品，并补以新译的代表作。又加以各国短篇小说的发展历史，名家传记与最近十年的译本索引，不但对已往的短篇小说界作一普遍的介绍，并且对于将来的短篇小说定有良好的影响！”
    十卷中，英、美、法、德、日各占一卷。编选人：“英国集”傅东华先生，“法国集”黎烈文先生，“日本集”郑伯奇先生，“美国集”由我自己凑数。前一年编辑“中国新文学大系”时，“诗集”原拟约郭沫若先生编选，因国民党反动派审查会的无理阻挠，没有如愿；以后改约了朱自清。这次我们坚决争取郭先生担任“德国集”的编选工作。住在日本千叶县的郭先生初因事忙，推宗白华先生担任，还为我们写了介绍信去找他；但经过我们恳切的要求，终于答应了。
