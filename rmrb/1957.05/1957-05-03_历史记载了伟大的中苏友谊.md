History Records the Great Sino-Soviet Friendship
周梅生 (Zhou Meisheng)

The history of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is an immortal, glorious, and moving epic in the history of human friendship.

China and the Soviet Union are both ancient and large countries. The two countries are neighbors, with a border stretching thousands of miles. Despite the obstacles of high mountains and vast fields and the obstruction of reactionary rulers throughout history, the people of both countries have had friendly contacts since ancient times. In particular, the historical traces of cultural exchanges are clearly verifiable. For example, Soviet scholar Rostowzew discovered after research that the ancient relics of the Scythian people (who once lived in the area of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia) in the Soviet Union have many similarities with the bronze ware patterns of the Warring States period in China. This shows that cultural exchanges between the two ethnic groups took place as early as more than two thousand years ago.

In modern times, advanced people in Russia have given deep sympathy and support to the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolutionary movement of 1851-1864, the Russian revolutionary democrat Chernyshevsky wrote articles celebrating the struggle of the Chinese peasants and vigorously opposed foreign interference in China's internal affairs. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion against imperialism broke out in China. The imperialist countries jointly attacked China. Lenin expressed his angry protest against the bloody massacres of imperialism in China in the first issue of "Iskra," and called on the Russian working class to fully oppose the crimes of national oppression. During the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Sixth All-Russian Party Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party adopted a resolution drafted by Lenin, stating that "the Russian proletariat watches the success of the Chinese revolutionary people with sincere excitement and full sympathy."

The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution created more favorable conditions for the development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The sound of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people; the birth of the world's first socialist country brought great encouragement and support to the Chinese revolution.

The Chinese people warmly welcomed the October Revolution. Li Dazhao's famous articles "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism," published in 1918, enthusiastically expressed the Chinese people's cheers for the October Revolution and powerfully refuted the shameless slanders of Chinese and foreign reactionaries. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also sent a telegram to the Soviet government and Lenin in Shanghai, congratulating them on their success. When the young Soviet country encountered the difficulties of foreign armed intervention, the Chinese people also gave possible support. Beijing students held rallies and demonstrations, fiercely opposing the Chinese reactionary government's participation in the armed intervention against the Soviet Union. In 1919, there were 30,000 to 40,000 Chinese workers on Soviet soil who joined the Red Army and supported the Soviet people's just struggle with their blood.

From the day it was born, the Soviet state showed sincere friendship and selfless support to the Chinese people. After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet government immediately announced the abolition of the unequal treaties signed by the Tsarist government with Eastern countries. Through the efforts of the Soviet government and the Chinese people, the Soviet Union signed the "Outline Agreement on Solving Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" with the then Chinese Beijing government in May 1924. This agreement stipulated: the abolition of all treaties signed between Tsarist Russia and China that damaged China's sovereignty and interests; the Soviet government abandoned all concessions of Tsarist Russia in China, cancelled China's Boxer indemnity, and abandoned extraterritoriality and consular jurisdiction in China. This was the first equal treaty China signed with a foreign country after the Opium War. This great spirit of national equality and sincere friendship towards the Chinese people shown by the Soviet state made the Chinese people, who were subjected to imperialist oppression, infinitely happy and grateful.

During the First Revolutionary Civil War in China, the Soviet Union actively helped establish the Chinese revolutionary united front. The Soviet Union sent people to visit Mr. Sun Yat-sen many times to express sympathy and support for the Chinese revolutionary government. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also realized from the facts that the Soviet Union was a true friend of China, and therefore welcomed Soviet assistance. With the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, the Kuomintang convened its First National Congress in January 1924, established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, and realized Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, thereby promoting the development of the Chinese revolutionary cause.

After the Chiang Kai-shek clique betrayed the revolution, it thoroughly betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies and shamelessly destroyed Sino-Soviet friendly relations. The reactionary Kuomintang government forcibly closed Soviet consulates in various places in December 1927, announced a complete break in relations with the Soviet Union, and provoked the Middle East Road Incident in 1929, launching a disgraceful attack on the Soviet Union. In order to maintain Sino-Soviet relations as much as possible, the Soviet government advocated a peaceful resolution, but was unreasonably rejected by the reactionary Kuomintang government, and had no choice but to announce the severance of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union on July 17, 1929.

However, the reactionary Kuomintang's crime of undermining Sino-Soviet relations could not stop the continued existence and development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The First National Congress of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, held in Ruijin in the Red Area in November 1931, passed the outline of the constitution, clearly proclaiming that the Soviet Union was a solid alliance of the Chinese Red regime.

Facts show that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's behavior of undermining Sino-Soviet relations facilitated imperialist aggression against China. Shortly after the Sino-Soviet severance of relations, on September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism launched an armed attack on the Northeast. Imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States adopted a policy of connivance and cover-up towards Japan's aggressive crimes. Only the socialist state of the Soviet Union stood on the position of safeguarding China's national interests. The Soviet Foreign Minister issued a statement on September 24: "The Soviet Union morally, spiritually, and emotionally fully sympathizes with China and is willing to provide all necessary assistance." However, the reactionary Kuomintang government, disregarding national interests, rejected the Soviet Union's proposal and fantasized that countries such as Britain and the United States would come out to uphold "justice." Under the Kuomintang reactionary government's policy of non-resistance, the Japanese aggressors quickly occupied the Northeast. After the fall of the Northeast, thousands of Northeast volunteers who persisted in resisting Japan were forced to retreat into Soviet territory with a large number of Chinese refugees. They were given a grand welcome and cordial reception by the Soviet government and people. Japan once requested the extradition of the volunteer army generals, but was sternly rejected by the Soviet Union.

After the September 18th Incident, the vast number of Chinese people clearly saw the preciousness of Sino-Soviet friendship and hated the crime of undermining Sino-Soviet relations even more. Various groups in the Northeast and people all over the country demanded the immediate restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations. The Soviet government also took the initiative to propose the restoration of diplomatic relations to the Kuomintang government. Under the pressure of the people across the country, the Kuomintang government officially resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union on December 12, 1932. People all over the country held rallies to celebrate the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations. As proposed in the telegram to the Soviet Union from fifty-seven writers including Lu Xun, "The Chinese people have clearly seen that only the Soviet Union is a loyal friend of the oppressed people."

In July 1937, Japan launched a full-scale offensive against China. In the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, countries such as the United States and Britain made huge profits from the war by supplying Japan with a large amount of materials. At that time, only the Soviet Union gave China tremendous support morally, materially, and in terms of manpower. Soviet newspapers condemned the crimes of the Japanese aggressors, and people in various places enthusiastically wrote letters to comfort the Chinese anti-Japanese army. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty signed on August 21 powerfully打击打日本侵略的气焰 (effectively curb the aggressive arrogance of Japan). From the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union supplied China with a large amount of military supplies in the form of low-interest loans, with loans reaching more than 300 million US dollars before the outbreak of the Soviet-German War. In June 1939, China and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of commerce and navigation,打击打日本对中国的经济封锁 (dealt a blow to Japan's economic blockade of China). Many Soviet volunteer air force personnel also personally came to China to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The heroic Soviet Air Force powerfully打击打日本空军的疯狂气焰 (effectively curb the frantic arrogance of the Japanese air force) after appearing in China. In order to help the Chinese people fight against imperialist aggression, more than one hundred Soviet volunteer pilots heroically sacrificed in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Their lofty internationalist spirit will always be respected and commemorated by the Chinese people.

In 1941, Hitler's Germany launched an offensive against the Soviet Union. The Soviet people concentrated their forces to resist the invasion of the fascist German bandits, while also maintaining considerable military strength in the Far East,钳制了日本侵略者的力量 (containing the strength of the Japanese aggressors). The Chinese people's struggle against the Japanese aggressors and the Soviet people's struggle against German fascism played a role of mutual encouragement and support. And when the Soviet Union defeated Hitler's Germany in 1945, it转师东向 (turned its troops eastward) according to the agreements of the Allied countries and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance (signed on August 14, 1945), quickly粉碎了日本百万关东军 (crushed Japan's million-strong Kwantung Army),解放了我国东北 (liberated Northeast China),迫使日本法西斯无条件投降 (forcing Japanese fascism to surrender unconditionally).

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched an anti-people civil war. The Soviet people angrily斥责 (denounced) the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary government and gave the Chinese people lofty support morally and spiritually. The Soviet government adhered to the position of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and at the same time,不断地揭露和反对 (constantly exposed and opposed) the United States' support for the Kuomintang reactionaries and interference in China's internal affairs. The Soviet Union's just stance played an important role in promoting the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China使中苏两国人民长久以来要求自由地和无限地发展亲密友谊的愿望如愿以偿了 (fulfilled the long-standing desire of the Chinese and Soviet people to freely and limitlessly develop close friendship). The day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union announced its recognition of our country and the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. On February 14, 1950, the two countries signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which had great historical significance,用条约形式固定下来八亿人民悠久深厚的兄弟友谊 (fixed the long-standing and profound brotherly friendship of 800 million people in the form of a treaty). From then on, the unbreakable alliance between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union became an important factor affecting modern international relations and the development of human history.

For more than seven years, on the basis of proletarian internationalism and the principle of national equality, the all-round cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in politics, economy and culture has achieved great development. The great and selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet Union in the economy and in all other aspects is something that our people will never forget.

When we look back on the development path of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, we are无比的兴奋和骄傲 (extremely excited and proud) for this真挚的、久经考验的兄弟般的永恒友谊 (sincere, time-tested, brotherly and eternal friendship).

    历史记载了伟大的中苏友谊
    周梅生
    中苏两国人民友谊的历史，是人类友谊史上一部永不磨灭的、光辉灿烂的、可歌可泣的史诗。
    中苏两国都是历史悠久的大国。两国毗邻而居，接壤的边界绵延数千里。尽管有着高山大野的障碍和历代反动统治的阻挠，但是，两国各族人民从古以来便发生了友好的接触。特别是文化交流的史迹班班可考。例如，苏联学者罗斯陀吾契夫经过研究后发现，苏联境内史基泰族（曾经居住在西伯利亚南部贝加尔湖一带）的古代文物，同我国战国时代的青铜器花纹有许多类似的地方。这说明远在两千多年以前，两国各民族之间便有了文化交流。
    近代以来，俄国的先进人士对于中国人民反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争给予了深切的同情和支持。在1851—1864年的太平天国农民革命运动中，俄国的革命民主主义者车尔尼雪夫斯基就曾撰文庆祝中国农民的斗争，并竭力反对外国对中国内政的干涉。1900年，中国爆发了义和团反帝运动。各帝国主义国家联合向中国进攻。列宁在第一期“火星报”上对帝国主义在中国的血腥屠杀表示了愤怒的抗议，并号召俄国工人阶级全力反对民族压迫的罪行。在1911年中国辛亥革命中，俄国社会民主工党第六次全俄党代表会议通过了列宁起草的决议，表示“俄国无产阶级以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情注视中国革命人民底成功”。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，给中苏两国人民友谊的发展创造了更加有利的条件。十月革命的炮声，给中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义；世界上第一个社会主义国家的诞生，给中国的革命带来了莫大的鼓舞和支援。
    中国人民热烈地欢迎十月革命。李大钊在1918年发表的“庶民的胜利”和“布尔什维主义的胜利”两篇著名的文章，热情地表达了中国人民对十月革命的欢呼，有力地驳斥了中外反动派的无耻诬蔑。孙中山先生也曾在上海致电给苏维埃政府和列宁，祝贺他们的成功。当年轻的苏维埃国家遭到外国武装干涉的困难时期，中国人民也给了可能的支持。北京学生曾经举行集会、示威，激烈反对中国反动政府参加对苏维埃国家的武装干涉。1919年，在苏维埃国土上的中国工人，曾有三、四万人参加了红军，用鲜血支援了苏联人民的正义斗争。
    苏维埃国家从它诞生的那一天起，便对中国人民表现了真诚的友谊和无私的支援。在十月革命胜利后，苏维埃政府立即宣布废除沙皇政府同东方各国签订的不平等条约。在苏维埃政府和中国人民的努力下，1924年5月苏联同当时的中国北京政府签订了“中俄解决悬案大纲协定”。这个协定规定：废除帝俄同中国签订的有损中国主权和利益的一切条约；苏联政府抛弃帝俄在中国的一切租界地，取消中国的庚子赔款，放弃在中国的治外法权和领事裁判权。这是鸦片战争后中国同外国签订的第一个平等条约。苏维埃国家这种伟大的民族平等精神和对中国人民的真挚友情，使备受帝国主义压迫的中国人民无限欢欣和感激。
    在中国第一次国内革命战争时期，苏联积极帮助中国革命统一战线的建立。苏联曾多次派人访晤孙中山先生，表达对中国革命政府的同情和支持。孙中山先生也从事实中认识到苏联是中国的真正朋友，因而欢迎苏联的帮助。在苏联和中国共产党的帮助下，1924年1月国民党召开了第一次全国代表大会，确立了联俄、联共和扶助工农三大政策，实现了国共合作，因而推动了中国革命事业的发展。
    蒋介石集团叛变革命后，彻底地背叛了孙中山先生的三大政策，无耻地破坏中苏友好关系。国民党反动政府于1927年12月用武力封闭各地苏联领事馆，宣布对苏联全面绝交，又于1929年挑起中东路事件，向苏联发动可耻的进攻。苏联政府为了尽力保持中苏关系，曾力主和平解决，但遭到国民党反动政府的无理拒绝，不得不于1929年7月17日宣布断绝中苏外交关系。
    但是，国民党反动派破坏中苏关系的罪行，并不能阻挡中苏两国人民友谊的继续存在和发展。1931年11月在红色区域瑞金召开的第一次全国工农代表大会，通过了宪法大纲，明确地宣告苏联是中国红色政权的巩固联盟。
    事实表明，蒋介石集团破坏中苏邦交的行为，便利了帝国主义对中国的侵略。中苏绝交后不久，1931年9月18日，日本帝国主义便向东北发动了武装进攻。英、美等帝国主义国家对日本的侵略罪行采取了纵容和包庇的态度。只有社会主义国家苏联站在维护中国民族利益的立场。苏联外交部长9月24日发表声明：“苏联在道义上、精神上、感情上完全同情中国；并愿作一切必要的帮助”。但是，不顾民族利益的国民党反动政府却拒绝了苏联的建议，幻想英、美等国出来主持“公正”。在国民党反动政府不抵抗政策下，日本侵略者迅速地侵占了东北。东北沦陷后，坚持抗战的东北义勇军有数千人被迫携带大批中国难民退入苏联国境。他们受到苏联政府和人民的盛大欢迎和亲切接待。日本曾经要求引渡义勇军将领，遭到苏联的严正拒绝。
    “九·一八”事变后，广大中国人民更加清楚地看到中苏友谊的可贵，更加痛恨破坏中苏关系的罪行。东北各团体和全国各地人民纷纷要求立即恢复中苏邦交。苏联政府也主动地向国民党政府提出恢复邦交。在全国人民的压力下，国民党政府于1932年12月12日同苏联正式复交。全国各地人民纷纷举行集会，庆祝中苏邦交恢复。正如鲁迅等五十七位作家致苏联贺电中所提出的，“中国民众已经很明显地看见，只有苏联是被压迫民众之忠实的朋友”。
    1937年7月，日本对中国发动了全面的进攻。中日战争初期，美英等国利用战争大发横财，把大量物资供应日本。当时只有苏联在道义上、物力上和人力上给了我国巨大的支援。苏联各报纷纷痛斥日本侵略者的罪行，各地人民热情地写信慰问中国抗战军队。8月21日中苏签订的互不侵犯条约，有力地打击了日本的侵略气焰。从战争开始，苏联便以低利贷款的形式供应中国大批军火，至苏德战争爆发前贷款达三亿美元以上。1939年6月中苏又签订通商航海条约，打击了日本对中国的经济封锁。苏联许多志愿空军人员还亲自到中国来参加了抗日战争。英雄的苏联空军出现在中国后，有力地打击了日本空军的疯狂气焰。为了帮助中国人民反对帝国主义的侵略，一百多名苏联志愿飞行员在抗日战争中壮烈牺牲。他们崇高的国际主义精神，永远受到中国人民的尊敬和纪念。
    1941年希特勒德国向苏联发动进攻，苏联人民集中力量抗击法西斯德寇的侵略，同时在远东也保持了相当的兵力，钳制了日本侵略者的力量。中国人民抗击日本侵略者和苏联人民抗击德国法西斯的斗争起着相互鼓舞和支援的作用。而当苏联在1945年击溃了希特勒德国后，它便根据盟国的协定和中苏友好同盟条约（1945年8月14日签字）转师东向，迅速地粉碎了日本百万关东军，解放了我国东北，迫使日本法西斯无条件投降。
    抗战胜利后，国民党反动派发动了反人民的内战。苏联人民愤怒地斥责国民党反动政府的罪行，在道义上和精神上给了中国人民崇高的支持。苏联政府坚持不干涉中国内政的立场，同时不断地揭露和反对美国支持国民党反动派和干涉中国内政的行为。苏联的正义立场对于促进中国人民解放战争的胜利起了重要的作用。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，使中苏两国人民长久以来要求自由地和无限地发展亲密友谊的愿望如愿以偿了。在中华人民共和国成立的第二天，苏联便宣布承认我国并同我国建立外交关系。1950年2月14日，两国签订了具有伟大历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约，把八亿人民悠久深厚的兄弟友谊用条约形式固定下来。从此，中苏两大国家牢不可破的同盟，便成为影响现代国际关系和人类历史发展的重要因素。
    七年多来，在无产阶级国际主义精神和民族平等原则的基础上，中苏两国在政治、经济和文化上的全面合作获得了巨大的发展。苏联在经济上和其他各方面所给予我们的巨大而无私的援助，是我国人民永远不能忘记的。
    当回顾中苏两国人民友谊发展道路的时候，我们为这种真挚的、久经考验的兄弟般的永恒友谊感到无比的兴奋和骄傲。
