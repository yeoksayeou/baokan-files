Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 25th: After four days of talks, the government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic signed a joint declaration in the Council of Ministers Building here on the 24th. At the same time, a consular agreement between the two countries was also signed. The joint declaration was signed by Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and head of the delegation, and Široký, Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia and head of the delegation. The consular agreement was signed by Democratic German Foreign Minister Bolz and Czech Foreign Minister Václav David.

The joint declaration expressed satisfaction with the further strengthening of the friendly relations between the two countries in recent years, which are based on the foundation of proletarian internationalism. The two countries decided to further strengthen economic cooperation in the future.

The declaration, in addressing the international situation, pointed out that the current imperialist aggressive blocs have entered a new period of preparing for atomic war. The militaristic resolutions passed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Bonn, the "European Atomic Energy Community" treaty, and the deployment of atomic weapons of various calibers within Western European countries are all examples of this. Both sides declared their willingness to resolutely fight against the expansion of armaments and to promote partial solutions to the disarmament issue.

The declaration stated that the governments of the two countries believe that the revival of West German militarism poses a serious threat to the peace and security of the peoples of Europe, and they will continue to strengthen the defense system of the Warsaw Treaty in the future. The declaration pointed out that the German Democratic Republic represents the true interests of the German people and is the foundation for the future of the whole of Germany as a peace-loving democratic country.

The governments of the two countries concluded the declaration by expressing their belief that it is practically possible to ease tensions in Europe and establish an atmosphere of trust and cooperation among European countries.

    德捷决定加强经济合作关系
    两国将继续巩固华沙条约的防御体系
    新华社柏林25日电　德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国两国政府代表团经过四天会谈后，24日在这里的部长会议大厦签订了一项联合宣言，同时签订了一项两国领事协定。在联合宣言上签字的是民主德国总理、代表团长格罗提渥和捷总理、代表团长西罗基。在领事协定上签字的是民主德国外长博尔茨和捷外长瓦·戴维。
    联合宣言对两国建立在无产阶级国际主义的基础上的友好关系近几年来的进一步加强表示满意。两国决定今后将进一步加强经济合作关系。
    宣言在谈到国际局势时指出，目前帝国主义侵略集团已经进入了准备原子战争的新时期。北大西洋公约组织理事会在波恩通过的军国主义决议，“欧洲原子能联营组织”公约，以及西欧各国境内配置了各种大小口径的原子武器等等，都是其中的事例。双方声明愿意坚决为反对扩充军备而斗争，并且促使裁军问题获得局部解决。
    宣言说，两国政府认为，西德军国主义的复活对欧洲各国人民的和平和安全是严重的威胁，它们今后将继续加强华沙条约的防御体系。宣言指出，德意志民主共和国代表德国人民真正的利益，并且是整个德国作为爱好和平的民主国家的前途的基础。
    两国政府宣言最后表示相信，缓和欧洲的紧张局势，建立欧洲各国之间的信任气氛和合作是有实际可能性的。
