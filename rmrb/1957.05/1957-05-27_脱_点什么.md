    What to "Shed"?
      "Taking off shoes to go into the fields" is a basic condition for cadres in the water-rich areas of southern China to participate in agricultural production. Even if you just stand in the fields, you have to take off your shoes and socks and roll up your trouser legs. "Taking off shoes to go into the fields" is a basic condition.
    In rural areas of North China and other plateau regions, "going to the fields" does not require taking off shoes. Moreover, in summer, taking off shoes to go to the fields can easily result in stepping on tribulus, and the pain, though not minor, is not a necessary part of the experience. Factories certainly don't require taking off shoes. But is there something else that needs to be shed?
    I heard that in a certain state-owned cotton mill in Beijing, the factory's cadres, in response to the Party's call to participate in production, established a system: on a certain day at a certain time, factory-level cadres come down to participate in production; on a certain day at a certain time, section-level cadres come down... and so on. It's commendable that the cadres' participation in labor production is not just a passing fad, but a regular system. However, this kind of deliberate descent with ranks, as if afraid of not being seen as "leaders" in the workshop, or even fearing that "leaders" might be confused with other "leaders," and thus making such strict regulations, is contrary to the spirit of the central government's instructions. The workers, in order to receive the "factory-level cadres" who come to the workshop, specially clean up the work environment for them. After the "factory-level cadres" leave, the workers compare their labor results with the extra labor expended by the workers, and exchange knowing smiles.
    From this, I feel that there really should be a specific requirement for such "factory-level cadres" to shed something. But what to "shed"? I can't think of it for a moment.

### “脱”点什么

    “脱”点什么
      “脱鞋下田”，在遍地水田的江南，对那里的干部参加农业生产来说是一个起码的条件。你就是到田里站一站，也要脱掉鞋袜，挽起裤腿。“脱鞋下田”是一个起码的条件。
    华北及其它高原地带的农村“下地”，是用不着脱鞋的。而且夏天脱了鞋下地，很容易踩上蒺藜，那痛楚的滋味虽也非浅，却非必要的锻炼。工厂更用不着脱鞋了。但是否也需要脱掉点什么呢？
    听说北京的国棉某厂，厂的干部响应党的号召参加生产，就订了一个制度：某天某时是厂级干部下来生产；某天某时是科级干部下来……等。使干部参加劳动生产不是一阵风地过去，而订出一套经常制度，这点是应当肯定的；但这种有意带着级别下去生产，生怕到了车间就显不出“长”的身分来，甚至怕“长”和“长”也混淆起来，规定得这样严格，却是与中央指示的精神相违背的。工人们为了接待“厂级干部”来车间，特为他们清理工作环境。“厂级干部”走后，工人对他们的劳动成果与工人们花费的额外劳动一比较，相视一笑。
    由此我觉得，对这样的“厂级干部”真是应该提出一个脱掉什么的具体要求。但“脱”什么呢？一时还想不出。
