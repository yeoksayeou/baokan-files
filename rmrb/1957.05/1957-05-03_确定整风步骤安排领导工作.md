This dispatch from our newspaper in Baoding, dated the 2nd: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee this afternoon to determine the steps and methods for carrying out the rectification movement throughout the province, as well as to strengthen leadership work.

The rectification movement in Hebei Province is planned to run from now until the end of September, starting with the Party organizations in leading organs at the county and regimental levels and above, as well as in large factories, mines, and universities. Among these, the rectification movement in the Party organizations of provincial-level leading organs will begin immediately. During this stage, some grassroots organizations will also be selected for pilot projects to prepare conditions for the rectification movement in grassroots Party organizations from September to February of next year.

The rectification movement will begin with the study of documents stipulated by the Central Committee. Some departments will also study documents related to their own work, so that members participating in the rectification movement can grasp the Central Committee's basic spirit regarding the correct handling of contradictions among the people and the carrying out of the rectification movement, laying a solid ideological foundation for in-depth examination.

The meeting paid special attention to discussing the issue of leadership in the movement, emphasizing that leading cadres should personally take charge. An eight-member leading group headed by Comrade Lin Tie, the First Secretary, was established, and the responsible persons of the rectification leading groups in the areas of Party affairs, mass organizations, united front work, finance and trade, industry, agriculture and forestry, culture and education, political and legal affairs, and the military region were also determined. The leading groups of Party organizations in provincial-level units were also established on the same evening. The meeting also emphasized that leading cadres must deeply study the Party's policies and guidelines during the movement, change the past abnormal phenomenon in which leadership lagged behind those being led to a certain extent, and earnestly assume the responsibility of leading the rectification movement. In order to obtain the supervision of non-Party members, the meeting also decided that some units could invite democratic personages who voluntarily participate in rectification studies to attend leading group meetings as nonvoting participants.

In order to allow the Provincial Committee to concentrate its efforts on leading the rectification and resolving the current contradictions among the people, the meeting emphasized that on the basis of the existing division of labor, the spirit of being proactive and bold in taking responsibility should be brought into full play, and the role of the Provincial People's Committee should be fully utilized. All issues that can be resolved and answered by the government should be resolved by the Provincial People's Committee. The issues that various departments prepare to submit to the Provincial Committee for discussion, as well as the work arrangements and conclusions of convening lower-level meetings, should be handled by the secretaries and Standing Committee members in charge of the work of the respective departments, and the Provincial Committee will generally no longer discuss them.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee, the meeting emphasized the principle of combining rectification with work and with resolving contradictions among the people in terms of the methods of rectification. From now on, provincial-level organs should, according to the nature of their work, divide up the main aspects of contradictions among the people and conduct inspections and research solutions. During the current study phase, provincial-level departments should also make necessary arrangements for business work on a section-by-section basis.

In order to restore and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, the meeting proposed that leading personnel of the provincial-level Party, government, and military begin participating in industrial and agricultural labor from this week and pay attention to constantly accumulating experience in order to create conditions for institutionalizing participation in labor.

    确定整风步骤安排领导工作
    本报保定2日电  中共河北省委今天下午举行常委扩大会议，确定在全省开展整风运动的步骤和方法以及加强领导工作。
    河北省的整风运动计划从现在起到9月底，先在县、团以上的领导机关、大型厂矿和大专学校的党组织中开展，其中省级领导机关党组织的整风运动立即开始。在这一阶段中，还要选择一些基层组织作试点，为9月以后至明年2月的基层党组织的整风运动准备条件。
    整风运动将从学习中央规定的文件开始，有的部门还将学习同自己工作有关的文件，使参加整风运动的成员掌握中央关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题和开展整风运动的基本精神，为深入检查奠定思想基础。
    会议特别注意讨论运动的领导问题，强调领导干部亲自动手，成立了以第一书记林铁同志为首的八人领导小组，并确定了党、群、统战、财贸、工业、农林、文教、政法、军区等方面的整风领导小组的负责人。省级各单位的党组织的领导小组，也在当日晚间成立。会议还强调，领导干部在运动中必须深入钻研党的方针政策，改变过去在某种程度上领导落后于被领导的反常现象，切实担当起领导整风运动的责任。为取得党外人士的监督，会议还决定有些单位可邀请自愿参加整风学习的民主人士列席领导小组。
    为使省委集中精力领导整风和解决当前人民内部矛盾的问题，会议强调在已经分工的基础上发挥积极主动、大胆负责的精神，充分发挥省人民委员会的作用。凡可由政府下达解决和答复的问题，都由省人民委员会解决。各部门准备提交省委讨论的问题和召开下级会议的工作布置和结论，由分工主管该部门工作的书记和常委来处理，省委一般不再讨论。
    会议根据中央的指示，在整风的方法上强调整风同工作结合、同解决人民内部矛盾结合的方针。省级机关从现在开始，就要根据本部门工作性质，对人民内部矛盾的几个主要方面，分工进行检查，研究解决办法。在目前学习阶段，省级各部门，还要以科室为单位，对业务工作作必要的安排。
    为恢复和发扬党密切联系群众的优良传统，会议提出省级党、政、军的领导人员从最近这个星期日起，开始参加工农业劳动，并注意不断地积累经验，为使参加劳动制度化创造条件。
