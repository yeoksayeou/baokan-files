What New Knowledge is Being Overlooked?
Qian Xuesen Proposes Four New Technology Research Directions

Qian Xuesen raised the issue of research and development in new academic departments. He said that what we often hear now is specialization. Everyone wants to be an expert, an authority, to establish their own unique approach, and delve deeply into a field of study. However, if this aspect is overemphasized, it is easy to overlook the comprehensive aspect of academics. When scholars gather together, those not in the same field cannot discuss academics, and it seems they shouldn't discuss academics either. Therefore, when the Academic Divisions hold meetings, they must be divided into groups when academic issues are involved. Experts in the same field can naturally talk intimately, but it is inevitable that everything will be uniform, and they will only talk about the same things. Such academic discussions often leave out things that are between disciplines, which are very likely to be growing points, and no one cares about them. Then our science will inevitably rely on others to discover new gardens and new fields, and then we will follow in their footsteps. In this way, we will naturally be behind others, not keeping pace with them, let alone taking the lead.

So, specifically, what new knowledge is being overlooked? I have already mentioned the refinement of social sciences at this Academic Divisions meeting, that is, introducing mathematical analysis tools from natural sciences into social sciences, that is, the knowledge between social sciences and natural sciences is being overlooked. I won't say more about that. Now I want to talk about the problems in natural sciences that are between disciplines and are being overlooked. The first problem is the artificial control of weather, that is, meteorological engineering. For an agricultural country like ours, this is the most important knowledge, but it is not found in our twelve-year long-term plan formulated last year. All that is seen is a small part of the whole problem: cloud and fog physics. The second problem is the artificial control of agricultural growth, that is, the factory farming of agriculture. The third is the chemicalization of mining. This is a mining method that does not require people to go underground. One advantage of this method is that it can reach very deep deposits. How deep a well can be drilled, how deep the mine can be mined, so it can greatly expand our mineral resources. The fourth problem is the weakening of strong electricity technology. We all know that weak electricity technology has made rapid progress in the past ten years or so; radio electronics is already the most prominent department in new technology, coupled with the recent development of automation in the production process, it is truly colorful, and new things emerge endlessly. In contrast, strong electricity technology is conservative, and has not changed much over the years. The weakening of strong electricity technology is a problem that should be studied at present.

These four new directions are just a few of the many possible development directions. If we make a comprehensive exploration, there will definitely be others. Moreover, this is only a problem in new technology. There are more examples in the development of disciplines, such as biophysics, astrochemistry, geomechanics, and cybernetics in the biological world. All these new problems have not appeared in our twelve-year science and technology long-term plan, which is not right; even if our views on these new problems and new knowledge are not consistent, and we cannot immediately vigorously promote them, then we must also carefully discuss what should be done, and we cannot just ignore them. How to correct this? He believes that a feasible way is to set up several special committees in and between the Academic Divisions of the Academy of Sciences to specifically explore new development directions. After clarifying the new directions, take measures to promote the research of the new directions. This is an important matter. Only in this way can we ensure that our science and technology is not the tail of others, but advanced science and technology.

    有什么新学问被忽略了？
    钱学森提出四个新技术的研究方向
    钱学森提出了新学术部门研究和发展的问题。他说，我们现在常常听到的是专门化，谁都要作专家、作权威，独树一帜，深入地去研究一门学问。但是，太强调了这一方面，就容易忽略了学术综合性的一面。学者们聚在一起，不同行就不能谈学问，而且也似乎不应该谈学问。于是乎学部开会，一牵涉到学术问题，就必得分小组。都是同行的专家，自然可以谈得心投意合，但也就不免清一色，谈的都是一路东西。这样讨论学术，就往往把那些介乎学科之间的，也就是很可能是生长点的东西在讨论中遗漏了，没有人去过问。那么我们的科学就必然依靠别人去发现新园地、新领域，然后我们才跟着进去。这样，自然在别人后面，不会是和别人并驾齐驱，更不是捷足先登了。
    那么具体说来，又有什么新学问被忽略了呢？我在这次学部大会里已经说过社会科学的精密化问题，也就是把自然科学里的数学分析工具引用到社会科学里去，也就是介乎社会科学和自然科学之间的学问被忽略了。我不再多说了。现在我想说的是自然科学里面介乎学科之间，而被忽略了的问题。第一个问题是气象的人工控制问题，也就是气象工程。对我们这样的农业国，这是第一号重要的学问，但是它不见于我们去年制定的十二年远景规划，看得到的只是整个问题的一小部分：云雾物理。第二个问题是人工控制生长的农业，也就是农业的工厂化问题。第三是采矿的化学化问题。这是不用人到地下去的采矿方法，这方法的一个优点是它能达到非常深的矿床，井能钻多深，就能采多深的矿，所以就能大大开拓我们的矿源。第四个问题是强电技术的弱电化问题。我们都知道弱电技术在近十几年来有突飞猛进的发展；无线电电子学已经是新技术里的最突出的一个部门，再加上最近在生产过程自动化的发展，真是五花八门，新事物层出不尽。相形之下，强电技术是保守的，多少年来也没有什么变化。强电技术的弱电化是当前应该研究的问题。
    这四个新方向，还不过是许多可能的发展方向中的几个，如果我们作一次全面的探讨，一定还有别的。而且这还只是新技术方面的问题，在学科发展里有更多的例子，像生物物理、天文化学、地质力学、生物世界里的控制论等等。所有这一切新问题都没有在我们的十二年科学技术远景规划里出现，这是不应该的；就是我们对这些新问题新学问的看法还不一致，还不能够立刻大力推动，那我们也得仔细讨论一下，看看到底应该怎么办，不能就把它们忽略了。怎样纠正呢？他认为可行的办法是：在科学院学部里和学部间设置几个专门委员会，专门探讨新发展方向，明确新方向之后，再采取措施来推动新方向的研究。这是一件重要的事，唯有这样才能保证我们的科学技术不是别人的尾巴，而是先进的科学技术。
