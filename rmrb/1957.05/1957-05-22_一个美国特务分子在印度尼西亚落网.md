Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 21st: According to newspaper reports, an American named Samorski was recently detained by military police in Ternate, the capital of the Moluccas Province in eastern Indonesia. Items seized from him included surveying instruments, a rubber motorboat equipped with a radio receiver, and medicines.

This American, who has been acting suspiciously, has been in the Moluccas Islands for a year, reportedly to "study the local dialect."

The "People's Daily" editorial pointed out that such foreign "scientists," "hunters," and "sociologists" with military ranks have come to Indonesia more than once to engage in espionage activities.
