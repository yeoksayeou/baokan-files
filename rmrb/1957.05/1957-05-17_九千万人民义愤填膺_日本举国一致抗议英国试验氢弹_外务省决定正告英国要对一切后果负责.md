Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: The United Kingdom's act of forcibly testing a hydrogen bomb, disregarding world opinion, has aroused unanimous anger and strong protests throughout Japan.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry decided this afternoon to lodge a protest with the United Kingdom, demanding that the United Kingdom cease hydrogen bomb testing and refrain from conducting such tests in the future. The Foreign Ministry also decided to inform the United Kingdom that the United Kingdom would be responsible for all damages and losses suffered by the Japanese people as a result of the United Kingdom's hydrogen bomb test, and the Japanese government reserves the right to demand compensation from the United Kingdom.

Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, also issued a statement today expressing regret over the UK's actions and stating that Japan should step up efforts to encourage the UK, the US and the Soviet Union to stop nuclear weapons testing.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement of protest today, stating that it would continue to demand that the United Kingdom cease testing, and at the same time make every effort to develop the rising public opinion in Japan against nuclear weapons testing into world opinion.

The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, with more than 200,000 members, sent a telegram of protest to British Prime Minister Macmillan today, and decided to designate May 17 as "General Uprising Day Against the Preparation of Atomic Warfare," instructing college students across the country to launch protest struggles. In Tokyo, many college students held protest demonstrations at the British Embassy in Japan today. As of noon today, students from fifteen universities had held emergency protest rallies. At the same time, students from eight universities have decided to hold a joint protest strike. The Federation estimates that by tonight, students from two-thirds of the universities across the country will have decided to participate in the joint strike.

Kyodo News reported that the news of the British hydrogen bomb test "greatly shocked" the atomic bomb-bombed cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the deep-sea fishing bases of Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Kochi and other prefectures, "and citizens and fishermen expressed anger and anxiety." The Nagasaki Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs sent a telegram to Macmillan at noon today, expressing strong protest.

Ikuo Yasui, Executive Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said: "The United Kingdom has defied world opinion. It has increased the anger of the people of the world, especially the Japanese people." He expressed his intention to seek cooperation from Asian countries such as India and the United Nations to promote the conclusion of an agreement banning nuclear explosions and the manufacture of nuclear weapons by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Many prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan have also issued statements condemning the British hydrogen bomb test.
