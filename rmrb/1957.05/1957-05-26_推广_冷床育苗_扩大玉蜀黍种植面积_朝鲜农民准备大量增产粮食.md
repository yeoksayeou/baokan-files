Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 24th: According to Pyongyang newspapers, North Korean farmers have set a production target of 3.4 million tons of grain this year (last year's grain production was 2.87 million tons). North Korean farmers are increasing production by promoting "cold bed seedling" and increasing the planting area of corn.

North Korean farmers have now completed more than 83% of their phased sowing plan and are currently working hard on rice transplanting.

This spring, the weather in northern Korea turned warm later than usual. Farmers quickly sowed seeds during the suitable planting period, and have sown more than in the same period last year. This spring, the planting area of the high-yield crop corn has increased by 15% compared to last year, and the planting area of cotton has also increased significantly.

Korea began transplanting rice seedlings on April 18th, using a new method of "cold bed seedling." Now, these rice seedlings have been basically transplanted. This year, paddy fields with this type of rice seedling account for about 12% of the total paddy field area. It is estimated that rice cultivated with this yield-increasing technology can increase production by 20% to 30%. General rice seedling transplanting has now begun.

"Cold bed seedling" is a method of cultivating seedlings in a simple greenhouse. This is a yield-increasing technology developed by Korean farmers in recent years under the climatic conditions of Korea. Because northern Korea is cold, warms up late, and cools down early, this method can mature rice seedlings one month earlier, which allows the rice to have more growing time and thus increase production. In the past, because this method required more capital and labor, only individual farmers or agricultural cooperatives used this method to grow rice on small plots of land. This year, with the advocacy and assistance of the government, it has begun to be promoted on a large scale.

### 推广“冷床育苗”扩大玉蜀黍种植面积  朝鲜农民准备大量增产粮食

    推广“冷床育苗”扩大玉蜀黍种植面积
    朝鲜农民准备大量增产粮食
    新华社平壤24日电　据平壤报纸报道，今年朝鲜北部农民提出了要争取粮食产量达到三百四十万吨的增产目标（去年粮食产量是二百八十七万吨）。朝鲜农民正在用推广“冷床育苗”和增加玉蜀黍的种植面积等办法来增加生产。
    朝鲜农民现在已经完成了分期播种计划的83％以上，目前正在紧张地进行插秧。
    今年春天，朝鲜北部天气转暖较迟，农民们迅速地在适合播种的时期播下了种子，目前比去年同期播得还多。今春丰产作物玉蜀黍的播种面积比去年增加了15％，棉花的播种面积也增加了很多。
    朝鲜从4月18日就开始插秧，这些稻秧是用“冷床育苗”的新方法培育出来的。现在，这些稻秧已经基本上插完了。今年插这种稻秧的水田占水田总面积的12％左右。估计用这种增产技术培植的稻谷可以增产20％到30％。现在已经开始插一般的稻秧。
      “冷床育苗”是在一种简单的温室中培育秧苗的方法。这是近几年来朝鲜农民研究成功的、在朝鲜的气候条件下的增产技术。因为朝鲜北部天气较冷，暖得迟，冷得早，用这种方法可以提前一个月育成稻秧，这样就可以使稻子有更多的生长时间而得以增产。以往因为这种方法要用较多的资财和劳力，只有个别的农民或农业社在小块土地上用这种方法种稻。今年在政府的提倡和帮助下，开始大规模地推广。
