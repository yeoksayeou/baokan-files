People's Daily Editorial Department at Wen Tianxiang's Martyrdom Site:

On May 6th, your office forwarded letters from Mr. Wang Jiuyi and Mr. Wen Zhou, which were received this afternoon. They pointed out in their letters that the location of Wen Tianxiang's martyrdom should be in the Fuxue Hutong area south of Jiaodaokou within the Andingmen gate, not on Luomashi Street outside the Xuanwumen gate as previously indicated. Their correction is accurate. In addition to sending them a special letter of thanks, please publish this letter in the corrections column.

Explanation of "Chu Lao"

On April 18th, your newspaper published a poem by Comrade Chen Yi about his visit to Yuquan Mountain on the eighth page, in which the fifth stanza contains the line "Chairman does not show age" (主席毫不出老). I did not understand the meaning of the two words "Chu Lao." I wrote to Comrade Chen Yi to inquire, and quickly received a reply from him. The reply is as follows:

"Comrade ××:

The Sichuan dialect "Chu Lao" means "to appear" or "to seem." For example, "顯老" (xian lao) means to look old, "顯得出老" (xiande chu lao) means to appear old, or "出老" (chu lao) means to look old, "不出老" (bu chu lao) means to not look old, etc. Chen Yi, April 20th"

Here, it is worth mentioning that Comrade Chen Yi quickly replied to the letter despite his busy schedule, which I greatly admire. This demonstrates the close relationship between leaders and the masses, and is something we should all learn from.

    文天祥就义处人民日报编辑部：
    5月6日你处转来王九一和闻舟两先生的信，今日下午收到。他们信中指出文天祥就义处应在今安定门内交道口以南府学胡同地方，不在今宣武门外骡马市大街。他们这一指正是对的。除专函向他们致谢外，并请你处将此信登更正栏。

     “出老”的解释
    4月18日你报第八版上刊登陈毅同志的游玉泉山纪实一首诗，内中第五节有“主席毫不出老”句。这 “出老”二字我不解其意，曾写信问陈毅同志，很快就得到他的复信。复信如下：“××同志：
    川语“出老”即显出之意。比如说显老，显得出老，或说出老，不出老等。　　　　陈毅　　4月20日”
    这里，值得一提的是陈毅同志在百忙中很快地答复来信，使我很为感佩，这表现了领导人与群众的密切关系，是值得我们大家学习的。    　　　　　朱芙英
