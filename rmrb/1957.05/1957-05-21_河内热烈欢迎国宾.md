    Hanoi Warmly Welcomes Distinguished Guests
    By Our Correspondent
    The people of Hanoi have been especially excited these past two days. Yesterday (May 19th), they just celebrated President Ho Chi Minh's sixty-seventh birthday, and today, they welcome a distinguished guest from afar – Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    Normally, the current climate is sweltering, but the continuous rain last night dissipated the recent heat, making it feel cool and pleasant. People say: Hanoi's climate is also welcoming the noble guest.
    Starting early in the morning, 150,000 Hanoians in festive attire, carrying colorful flags and flowers, joyfully poured into the streets, lining both sides of the avenue leading to Gia Lam Airport.
    From Hang Dau Street and Phan Dinh Phung Street to Hung Vuong Street and other tree-lined boulevards, tens of thousands of red flags of all sizes fluttered in the wind. Two light and beautiful decorated archways were erected at the Long Bien Bridge, with purple-red pillars and dark-green roofs, and eye-catching red banners hanging above. Loudspeakers installed on the streets continuously broadcast famous Soviet songs and the "Song of Voroshilov."
    Almost every household in the Gia Lam urban area hung red flags and huge welcome banners in front of their doors.
    The airport was packed with welcoming crowds. There were officials from the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, representatives from the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam Workers' Party, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as workers, students, cadres, and citizens of Hanoi; to welcome Uncle Vo, who is old, respected and does not hesitate to travel a long way, recently, people from the seventeen northern provinces of Vietnam, from the Sino-Vietnamese border to the banks of the Bien Hai River, also sent their representatives. Workers at the Hanoi Machine Factory are installing machinery shipped from Leningrad, and their main workshop will be put into production on the day Uncle Vo visits the factory. Lo Van Cau, a combat hero of the Vietnam People's Army who visited the Soviet Union during the war of resistance, Nong Quoc Tran, a poet of the Tho ethnic group, and returned students and technicians who had recently returned from studying in the Soviet Union also came to welcome him.
    People excitedly talked about "Lien Xo" (Vietnamese for Soviet Union) as if they were talking about their neighbors and relatives. For Vietnam, the Soviet Union is not only the pioneer of the new world but also the closest brother and confidant. Not to mention the profound impact of the October Revolution on the Vietnamese revolution, the younger generation of Vietnam can remember the strong support and solidarity of the Soviet brothers for the Vietnamese war of resistance; the heroic struggle and great victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War encouraged countless Vietnamese sons and daughters to fight bravely to eliminate the last French invaders. In the enemy's rear guerrilla areas and on the Dien Bien Phu front, heroes of the "Zoya" and "Matrosov" type also repeatedly appeared: Bui Thi Cuc, Nguyen Thi Than, Qu Chinh Lan…. After the restoration of peace in the Indochina Peninsula, the Soviet Union immediately provided 400 million rubles of free assistance to help Vietnam heal the wounds left by the war; and what moved the Vietnamese comrades most was the Soviet experts who shared their weal and woe. These "Tovarich" (comrades) who grew up in cold regions, regardless of the scorching sun and mosquito bites, climbed mountains and crossed rivers with them, explored underground treasures, helped establish modern industrial and mining enterprises, and eliminated diseases.
    President Ho Chi Minh quietly entered the airport as usual but was quickly discovered. People enthusiastically shouted "Uncle Ho," yelling and jumping; applause rolled across the airport like waves of thunder.
    President Ho wore a beige khaki uniform and a pair of "war of resistance shoes" made of car tires. He was full of energy and walked briskly. His face was ruddy, and his bright eyes sparkled with joy.
    At 9:40, a silver plane approached from afar, and more than 7,000 pairs of eyes watched it circle and descend. The welcoming crowd waved bouquets and red flags, as well as conical hats, turbans... forming a colorful wave, a tide of cheers.
    President Ho clasped his hands together, looking a little excited, perhaps because his eagerness to meet was more urgent than others, because for him, Chairman Voroshilov was not only a state guest but also a close friend. As early as 1924, when President Ho first visited the Soviet Union, they met; in 1955, they met again in Moscow; and today they are gathering here again.
    The plane landed, and a radiant Chairman Voroshilov appeared at the cabin door. President Ho quickly stepped forward and cordially called out: "Kliment Yefremovich!" Then the two old friends embraced tightly.
    Chairman Voroshilov and President Ho Chi Minh reviewed the guard of honor composed of the most outstanding soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army. They brought the honor from the 1946 Capital Defense War to the Dien Bien Phu Campaign to accept the review of the Soviet Marshal, who is admired by peace-loving people all over the world for his outstanding achievements.
    Afterward, the two heads of state came to the welcomers. When they walked to the ranks of Soviet envoys and experts, President Ho said in Russian: "I don't need this interpreter!" The hearty laughter of the two old friends infected the welcoming crowd.
    The welcome line of 7,000 people was not short. The two heads of state came to the cheering crowd. An old Kinh man, Phan Cong Tho, presented a bouquet of flowers to Voroshilov. The distinguished guest had a short conversation with him:
      "May I ask how old you are?"
    "Sixty-eight."
      "Still young, your beard is longer than your age!"
      "Thank you, I wish you longevity!"
    At this time, President Ho was standing next to him. After hearing these dialogues, he laughed with the two old men.
    An open-top car decorated with lotus flowers was parked in the center of the airport. The two heads of state humbly let each other go up, and President Ho invited Voroshilov to go to the Presidential Palace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi via Gia Lam to rest. On the Long Bien Bridge side, an even longer cheering line was waiting for the distinguished guests.

    河内热烈欢迎国宾
    本报记者
    河内人这两天特别兴奋，昨天（5月19日）刚庆祝过胡志明主席六十七岁寿辰，今天，又迎接不远万里而来的国宾——苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫。
    按理现在的气候正是盛暑，但昨夜连绵的雨水却把近日以来的酷热吹散，显得凉快宜人。人们说：河内的气候也在欢迎高贵的客人。
    从清早开始，穿着节日盛装的十五万河内人打着采旗、拿着鲜花，兴高彩烈地涌向街头，涌向通往嘉林机场的大道两旁。
    从行豆街、潘庭逢街到雄王街等林荫大道上，千万面大大小小的红旗迎风飘扬。龙编桥头搭起了两座轻巧、美丽的彩牌楼，紫红色的边柱，深绿色的顶盖，上面悬着醒目的红色横幅。装置在街头上的扩音器，不时的放送着苏联的著名歌曲和“伏罗希洛夫之歌”。
    嘉林市区几乎家家门前都挂上了红旗和巨大的欢迎横额。
    机场上，站满了欢迎的人群。这里有越南民主共和国政府的官员们，有越南民主共和国国会、越南劳动党、各民主党派和人民团体的代表们，有河内市的工人、学生、干部和市民们；为了欢迎这位年高德劭而不辞辛劳远道来访的伏伯伯，最近，从中、越边境到边海河畔的北越十七个省的人民，也都派来了自己的代表。河内机器制造厂的工人正在安装由列宁格勒运来的机器，他们的主要车间将在伏伯伯参观工厂的那天投入生产。抗战期间访问过苏联的越南人民军战斗英雄罗文球、土族诗人农国镇，不久前才从苏联学习回来的留学生和技术工人等也来欢迎。
    人们兴致勃勃地谈着“联苏”（越南话苏联）就像谈论着自己的邻邦和亲人一样。对于越南，苏联不仅是新世界的开路先锋，还是最亲切的兄弟和知己。且不说十月革命对于越南革命的深远影响，越南的年青一代都能记得苏联兄弟对越南抗战强有力的支持和声援；苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中的英勇斗争和伟大胜利，曾鼓舞过多少越南儿女为消灭最后一个法国侵略者而奋勇作战，在越南的敌后游击区和奠边府前线，也曾屡次出现“卓娅”和“马特洛索夫”式的英雄：裴氏菊、阮氏膻、瞿正澜……。印度支那半岛和平恢复以后，苏联立刻提供四亿卢布的无偿援助，帮助越南医治战争留下的创伤；而最使越南同志感动的是同他们共甘苦的苏联专家。这些生长在寒冷地带的“塔瓦里希”（同志）不顾烈日的曝晒、蚊蚋的叮咬，同他们一起爬山越岗、过河淌水，勘察地下的宝藏，帮助建立近代化的工矿企业和消灭疾病。
    胡志明主席照例静悄悄地进入机场，但仍然很快地被发现了。人们热情的唤着“胡伯伯”，叫着，跳着；掌声像一阵阵轻雷，滚过机场。
    胡主席穿一身米色卡叽布制服，着一双汽车轮胎做的“抗战鞋”。精神矍铄，健步如飞。他面色红润，炯炯有神的眼睛闪耀着喜悦的光芒。
    9时40分，一架银色的飞机由远而近，七千多双眼睛迎望着它盘旋下降。欢迎的人群挥舞着手中的花束和红旗，还有通帽，头巾……形成一片彩色缤纷的浪潮、欢呼的波涛。
    胡主席攒着双手，显得有点激动，也许他期待会见的心情比别人更急切，因为对于他，伏罗希洛夫主席不仅是一位国宾，还是一位亲密的朋友。早在1924年间，胡主席第一次访问苏联的时候他们便相识了；1955年他们在莫斯科再度相逢；而今天又要在这里聚首了。
    飞机着陆了，容光焕发的伏罗希洛夫主席出现在机舱门口，胡主席急步迎上前去，亲切地唤道：“克里门特·叶弗列莫维奇！”于是两位老朋友便紧紧地拥抱在一起了。
    伏罗希洛夫主席和胡志明主席一起检阅了由越南人民军最优秀的战士们组成的仪仗队。他们带着从1946年首都保卫战一直到奠边府战役的荣誉前来接受为全世界爱好和平人民敬仰的功勋赫赫的苏联元帅的检阅。
    随后，两位元首来到了欢迎者的面前，当走到苏联使节和专家行列跟前时，胡主席用俄语说：“我这个译员用不着了！”两位老朋友会心的欢笑，感染了欢迎的人群。
    七千人的欢迎行列不是很短的。两位元首来到了欢腾的群众前面。一位京族老人潘功寿捧着一束鲜花献给伏罗希洛夫，贵宾同他进行了一段短促的谈话：
      “请问你高龄多少？”
    “六十八了。”
      “还年轻，您的胡须比岁数还长！”
      “谢谢，祝您长生不老！”
    这时胡主席就站在旁边，听到这些对话以后，也同两位老人一起笑了。
    一辆环饰着莲花的敞篷汽车停在机场正中，两位元首互相谦让着走上去，胡主席请伏罗希洛夫过嘉林去河内越南民主共和国主席府休息。在龙编桥那一边，更长的欢腾的行列在等待着贵宾。
