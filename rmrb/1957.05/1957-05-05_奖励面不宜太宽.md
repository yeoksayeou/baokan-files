    Rewards Should Not Be Too Broad
    I disagree with widening the scope of rewards. Because doing so will inevitably reduce the positive effect of production bonuses, and may even have certain side effects.
    I advocate giving bonuses to those who have achieved relatively significant results through creative labor under reasonable production targets. For those who have only completed the task in general, or although they have over-fulfilled the task, but the results are not very significant, they can be given appropriate spiritual praise and comfort to encourage them to emulate those with significant achievements; there is no need to give bonuses. I think this can achieve the purpose of encouraging production, commending advanced elements, and driving the backward; and it can also satisfy the masses, and the recipients will not feel ashamed.

    奖励面不宜太宽
    我不同意放宽奖励面。因为这样做势必会降低生产奖金的积极作用，甚至会起一定程度的副作用。
    我主张把奖金发给那些在合理的生产指标下，由于创造性的劳动，获得了比较显著成绩的人。对于一般的仅完成了任务，或者虽然超额完成了任务，但成绩并不太显著的，可从精神上给以适当的表扬和安慰，鼓励他们向成绩显著的人看齐；而不必发给奖金。我想，这样既可达到鼓励生产，表彰先进，带动落后的目的；又可使群众满意，受奖者也不致感到有愧。　　　杨志明
