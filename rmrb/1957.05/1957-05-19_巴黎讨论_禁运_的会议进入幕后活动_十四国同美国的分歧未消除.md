Xinhua News Agency, May 18th - Washington diplomatic circles say that the fourteen countries out of the fifteen member states of the so-called "China Trade Control Committee" have not eliminated their differences with the United States on the issue of the China "embargo." With the exception of the United States, the other fourteen countries unanimously advocate abolishing the China trade "embargo" list, so that the restrictions on trade with China are consistent with the restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union.

This so-called "Control Committee," which was specifically established to obstruct trade with China, recently held a meeting in Paris. The meeting is now in recess. Its member states are engaged in "behind-the-scenes activities" in order to "ease" the contradictions.

News reports say that in previous meetings, Britain consistently insisted on easing restrictions on trade with China. Britain's proposal was strongly supported by West Germany and Japan. It is said that the U.S. representative only agreed to remove 150 previously "embargoed" goods from the China trade "embargo" list, but did not agree to apply the same "embargo" list to all socialist countries.

    巴黎讨论“禁运”的会议进入幕后活动
    十四国同美国的分歧未消除
    据新华社18日讯　华盛顿外交界人士说：所谓“对华贸易管制委员会”的十五个成员国中的十四国在对华“禁运”问题上同美国的分歧还没有消除。除美国外，其他十四国一致主张废除对华贸易“禁运”货单，使对中国贸易的限制同对苏联贸易的限制趋于一致。
    这个专为阻挠对中国贸易而设立的所谓“管制委员会”最近在巴黎召开了会议。会议现在正在休会阶段。它的成员国正在进行“幕后活动”，以便“缓和”矛盾。
    有消息说：在前几天的会上，英国始终坚持要放松对中国贸易的限制。英国的主张获得西德和日本的竭力支持。据说：美国代表只同意从对华贸易“禁运”货单上取消一百五十项以前受“禁运”的货物，但是不同意对所有社会主义国家适用一样的“禁运”货单。
