According to a Polish Press Agency report on the 11th, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party recently held a meeting in Warsaw on the issue of ethnic minorities, discussing the Secretariat's proposal on measures to be taken against nationalism and anti-Semitism, and the Secretariat's resolution on the Ukrainian minority in Poland.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the Party's attitude towards the issue of ethnic minorities, as stated in the Secretariat's instructions, must be more clearly communicated to society. The committee called on all Party organizations to combat nationalism and anti-Semitism, as well as any form of discrimination against Polish ethnic minorities.

The committee also expressed its support for the opinions put forward by Party members and public opinion, demanding that the public security police, the procuratorate, and the courts more actively impose sanctions, in accordance with the provisions of the criminal law, against crimes of nationalism, chauvinism, and anti-Semitism that harm national dignity.
