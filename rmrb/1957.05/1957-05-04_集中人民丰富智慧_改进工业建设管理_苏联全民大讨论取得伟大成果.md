    Concentrating the Rich Wisdom of the People to Improve Industrial Construction Management
    Great Achievements of the Soviet Union's Nationwide Discussion
    (Our Moscow Dispatch, May 3rd) Reporter Li He reports: The Soviet Union's nationwide discussion on improving the economic management system has been going on for nearly a month. The scale of the discussion is very large, and the opinions expressed are very enthusiastic.
    This nationwide discussion revolves around Comrade Khrushchev's draft report on further improving the organization of industrial and construction management. From the draft, it is not difficult to see a central idea: to expand the power of local authorities in economic management, increase local independence, and give play to local initiative and potential, that is, to completely resolve the contradiction between excessive centralization and local initiative in the past. This contradiction is to be resolved through nationwide discussion and criticism.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, engineers, scientists, as well as economic, Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League workers have all devoted themselves to this great discussion. They have widely expressed their opinions, put forward suggestions, and made criticisms at meetings and in newspapers and periodicals. People pooled their wisdom to explore: What is the role of shifting the focus of day-to-day leadership of industry and construction to the local level? How to rationally divide management areas? What should be the organization and functions of regional management agencies? Which central specialized departments and competent authorities need to be retained? How should scientific research institutions be reorganized? The discussion is now entering its final stage. The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various union republics are holding plenary sessions to gather the opinions of the people and determine specific proposals.
    How to Divide Economic Administrative Regions According to the Industrial and Construction Situation
    In the nationwide discussion, people agreed to establish national economic committees in various economic administrative regions to specifically and effectively lead local industry and construction. The division of economic administrative regions is determined according to the specific situation of the local industrial and construction composition and development, not according to the size of the place and the original administrative scope. Generally speaking, among the fifteen union republics in the Soviet Union, except for the Russian Federal Republic, which will be divided into many economic zones, and the Ukrainian Republic, which will be divided into eleven economic zones, the other thirteen union republics will each form one economic zone. Within the Russian Federal Republic, people generally tend to advocate that each relatively developed autonomous republic, frontier region, state, and city, together with states with not too many enterprises around the city, should form an economic zone. However, some people advocate forming larger economic zones, which has caused controversy. Some people have proposed that the industrially developed city of Moscow and the Moscow Oblast should each form an economic zone; others believe that the two are very closely related and should only form one. There are similar debates regarding the Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Urals. Some people advocate that the Krasnodar and Stavropol frontier regions and the Rostov and Kamensk Oblasts should form the North Caucasus Economic Region, but others believe that these states are economically developed and should all form separate economic regions.
    How Should the National Economic Committee, the Basic Link in the Management of Industry and Construction, Function?
    In the plans put forward by various localities, it is agreed that the National Economic Committee should be regarded as the basic link in the management of industry and construction. It directly manages the industrial enterprises and construction units within its territory that were originally under the jurisdiction of the Union-Republic, while local Soviets manage local industries. The National Economic Committee is under the dual leadership of the governments of the Union Republics and the Soviet government. Taking the preliminary plan of Uzbekistan as an example, the National Economic Committee of this economic zone will manage 404 enterprises in 71 industrial sectors and 57 construction and other trusts (excluding water, land, and air transportation). It will lead enterprises, construction sites, technical schools, and scientific research institutions through twelve bureaus such as electric power, machinery manufacturing, geology, construction, building materials, and light industry. It will strictly implement the tasks stipulated in the unified plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union. It will simultaneously obey the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Republic and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. This enables the interests of the entire Soviet Union and local interests to be well integrated. With the establishment of the National Economic Committee, the institutions of many vertically led ministries and bureaus will be abolished, and personnel will also be streamlined. In order to give play to the role of local Soviets, all local and cooperative industries, as well as bread and beer industries, will be placed under the leadership of state, city, and district Soviets.
    What Kind of Disputes Have Occurred Regarding the Principles of Economic Management?
    During the Soviet Union's nationwide discussion on the National Economic Committee, several disputes occurred. First, some people felt that the Soviet and Republican governments should not only be concerned with the plans of the National Economic Committee, and advocated the establishment of a Supreme National Economic Committee in the central government as the highest agency for managing Soviet industry. This opinion was opposed by the people. People said that this would cause the National Economic Committee to lose its role as the basic link in economic management, the independence of the localities could not be brought into play, and the central agencies would be duplicated, which is equivalent to maintaining the old principle of managing the economy by specialized ministries and bureaus. Second, some people felt that the existing economic management system and the connections between enterprises have been formed for a long time, and although there are shortcomings, they are very solid, so they advocated reorganizing in two steps: first, merge the specialized ministries and set up bureaus in the economic zones at the same time. Then, after the bureaus are consolidated, the National Economic Committee will be established and the various specialized ministries will be abolished. People refuted that it is difficult to rationally merge the various specialized ministries; transitional specialized ministries cannot work well and deal with long-term issues; setting up more bureaus will increase the number of institutions. Moreover, such a reorganization takes a long time and will have an adverse impact on the work of factories and mines and construction sites. Third, although the outline has already pointed out that local Soviets can listen to the work reports of the National Economic Committee, and local Soviets have heavy tasks in leading local industry and agriculture: some people still propose that since the National Economic Committee is an economic management agency, it should obey the local Soviet and should lead the economy through the Soviet. Some people specifically suggested: The plenary session of the National Economic Committee should be generated from the representatives of local Party, Soviet, trade union, and other social organizations, and the members of the plenary session should be approved by the government of the Union Republic, and the presidium should be responsible for the daily work. The National Economic Committee should obey the government in terms of planning, and at the same time implement the decisions of the Supreme Soviet and local Soviets.
    After the establishment of the National Economic Committees in the various economic zones, many specialized ministries of the Soviet Union and the Republics that manage industry and construction will be abolished. In the discussion, people said that other specialized ministries should be abolished, but the Ministry of Transport (i.e., the Ministry of Railways), the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Power Stations, which are related to the entire Soviet Union, cannot be abolished. Some people also believe that industries such as steel, coal, and petroleum are also inseparable, so even if they are not unified in the entire Soviet Union, they must be managed and led in a unified manner within the scope of the Union Republic, and the corresponding specialized ministries should be retained.
    How Can Scientific Research and Higher Education Institutions Better Integrate with Production?
    The reorganization of the economic management system has led to the issue of the reorganization of scientific research institutions and higher education institutions. There are many disputes about this issue. Some people advocate that the scientific research institutions of the central specialized ministries should be placed under the leadership of the National Economic Committees in the economic zones where they are located, in order to strengthen the connection between scientific research and local practice; others believe that the principle of regional management cannot be mechanically applied to the leadership of scientific research institutions. The scientific research institutions of the central specialized ministries should be placed under the leadership of the professional departments or technical committees of the State Planning Commission, otherwise it will be difficult to promote the scientific and technological achievements of a region's scientific research institutions in other economic zones. Some people advocate that some scientific research institutions and universities in large cities should be moved to locations close to production, and the existing and newly established scientific research institutions should be strengthened in the economic zones; a huge scientific center should be established in Siberia. Others believe that it is necessary to distinguish which scientific research institutions should be preserved in the central government and which should be handed over to the National Economic Committee. Scientific research institutions are interconnected, and concentrating them in a few central cities is better than dispersing them in various places. The most effective way to combine scientific research with production is to establish perfect laboratories in enterprises. The conditions for establishing a scientific center in Siberia are not yet sufficient, and the more important issue is to strengthen the scientific research institutions that have already been established in various places.
    The nationwide discussion reflects the Soviet people's concern for national affairs. The rich wisdom of the broad masses of the people will be concentrated and brought to the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in early May for discussion and decision.

    集中人民丰富智慧　改进工业建设管理
    苏联全民大讨论取得伟大成果
    本报莫斯科3日电　记者李何报道：苏联全国人民讨论改进经济管理制度已将近一个月。讨论规模非常巨大，发表意见非常踊跃。
    这次全民讨论是围绕着赫鲁晓夫同志的关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的报告提纲进行的。从提纲中不难看出一个中心思想：在经济管理方面扩大地方的权力，提高地方的独立性，以发挥地方的积极性和潜力，也就是说，要彻底解决以往过分集中与地方的能动性之间的矛盾。这个矛盾是准备以全民讨论和批评的方式来解决的。
    广大的工人、农民、工程师、科学家以及经济、党、苏维埃、工会、青年团的工作者都投入了这次的大讨论中。他们在会议上和报刊上广泛地发表意见、提出建议和批评。人们集思广益地探讨着：把工业和建设的日常领导重心移到地方去有什么作用？如何合理地划分管理地区？分区管理的机构和职权应该是怎样的？中央专业部和主管机关当中哪些需要保留？科学研究机关应该怎样改组？现在讨论已进入结束阶段。各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会正在举行全会，把人民的意见集中起来，确定具体的建议。
    根据工业和建设情况怎样划分经济行政区
    在全民讨论中人们赞成在各个经济行政区设立国民经济委员会，以便具体地有效地领导当地的工业和建设。而经济行政区的划分，是按当地工业和建设构成情况以及发展的具体情况来决定，不是按照地方的大小和原来的行政范围。大体上，在苏联十五个加盟共和国中，除去俄罗斯联邦共和国将划分许多经济区和乌克兰共和国将划分十一个经济区以外，其他十三个加盟共和国都将各组成一个经济区。在俄罗斯联邦共和国内，人们基本上偏向于主张把每一个工业和建设比较发达的自治共和国、边疆区、州、市连带市周围企业不太多的州组成经济区。但也有人主张组成较大的经济区，因而引起争论。有人提出把工业发达的莫斯科市和莫斯科州各组成一个经济区；有人认为两者关系非常密切，只应组成一个。对于在乌拉尔的斯维尔德洛夫斯克州和车里雅宾斯克州，也有类似的辩论。有人主张把克拉斯诺达尔、斯塔夫罗波尔两个边疆区和罗斯托夫、卡明斯克两个州组成北高加索经济区，但又有人认为这几个州经济都很发达，都应组成单独的经济区。
    管理工业和建设的基本环节国民经济委员会职能如何
    各地提出的方案中，同意把国民经济委员会当作管理工业和建设的基本环节，它直接管理境内原属联盟兼共和国的工业企业和建设单位，而由地方苏维埃管理地方工业。国民经济委员会受加盟共和国政府和苏联政府的双重领导。以乌兹别克斯坦的初步方案为例，这个经济区的国民经济委员会将管理七十一个工业部门的四百零四个企业和五十七项建设及其他托辣斯（水陆空交通在外）。它将经过电力、机器制造、地质、建筑、建筑材料、轻工业等十二个局来领导企业、工地、技术学校、科学研究机关。它将严格地执行苏联发展国民经济的统一计划所规定的任务。它将同时服从乌兹别克共和国部长会议和苏联部长会议。这使全苏利益和地方利益能够很好地结合。由于国民经济委员会的设立，原有许多垂直领导的部和局的机构将取消，而人员也将精简。为了发挥地方苏维埃的作用，将把一切地方性的和合作社的工业，以及面包、啤酒工业等划归州、市和区的苏维埃领导。
    关于经济管理的原则问题发生了些什么样的争论
    在苏联全民讨论国民经济委员会这个环节的时候，发生过几点争论。其一，有人觉得苏联和共和国政府不应只过问国民经济委员会的计划，主张在中央设立最高国民经济委员会，作为管理苏联工业的最高机构。这个意见遭到人们的反对。人们说，这样会使国民经济委员会失去作为管理经济的基本环节的作用，使地方的独立性不能发挥，使中央机构重叠，等于保持由专业部和局管理经济的旧原则。其二，有人觉得现有的经济管理制度和企业之间的联系是长期形成的，虽然有缺点，但是很结实，所以主张分两步改组：首先合并专业部同时在经济区设局。然后，即在局巩固以后，再设立国民经济委员会和取消各个专业部。人们反驳说：各个专业部难于合理地合并；过渡性质的专业部不能很好地工作和处理远景问题；多设局便增加机构。而且这样的改组把时间拉得很长，将给厂矿和工地的工作以不利的影响。其三，虽然提纲中已经指出，地方苏维埃可以听取国民经济委员会的工作报告，地方苏维埃领导地方工业和农业的任务很重：但是有人仍然提出，国民经济委员会既然是经济管理机构，应该服从地方苏维埃，应该通过苏维埃来领导经济。有人具体地建议：从地方党、苏维埃、工会和其他社会团体的代表中产生国民经济委员会的全会，全会的成员经加盟共和国政府批准，日常工作由主席团负责。国民经济委员会在计划方面服从政府，同时执行最高苏维埃和地方苏维埃的决定。
    在各经济区的国民经济委员会设立以后，苏联和共和国的许多管理工业和建设的专业部将取消。在讨论中，人们表示，其他专业部应该取消，但是关系全苏的交通部（即铁道部）、邮电部、农业部和电站部不能取消。有人还认为，像钢铁、煤、石油这些工业也是不可分割的，所以即使不在全苏也要在加盟共和国范围内进行统一的管理和领导，保留相当的专业部。
    科学研究和高等教育机关怎样才能更好结合生产
    经济管理制度的改组引起了科学研究机关和高等教育机关的改组问题。关于这个问题的争论很多。一部分人主张，把中央专业部的科学研究机关划归它们所在的经济区的国民经济委员会领导，以便加强科学研究和地方实际的联系；另一部分人认为，分区管理的原则不能机械地搬用在领导科学研究机关上，中央专业部的科学研究机关应该划归国家计划委员会的专业部门或者技术委员会领导，不然便会使一个地区科学研究机关的科学和技术成就难以在别的经济区推广。有的人主张，把大城市内一部分科学研究机关和高等学校迁移到接近生产的所在地去，在经济区加强原有的和建立新的科学研究机关；在西伯利亚建立一个巨大的科学中心。另外一些人认为：需要区别哪些科学研究机关宜于保存在中央，哪些宜于移交国民经济委员会。科学研究机关相互联系，集中在少数中心城市比分散在各地好。科学研究结合生产的最有效办法是在企业中建立完善的实验室。在西伯利亚建立科学中心的条件还不够，更重要的问题在于把各地已经建立的科学研究机关加强起来。
    全民讨论反映了苏联人民群众对于国家大事的关心。广大人民的丰富智慧将被集中起来，拿到5月上旬的苏联最高苏维埃会议上讨论和决定。
