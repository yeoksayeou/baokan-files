Xinhua News Agency, 18th: "Why hasn't the flower of traditional Chinese painting bloomed well to this day?" This was said by several veteran traditional Chinese painters at a symposium held in Beijing today by the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association. They said, "A good flower will wither without sunshine and rain." Traditional Chinese painter Pan Jiezi believes that the ranks of traditional Chinese painters are large, but because they have not been properly arranged in recent years, many forces have been offset. Traditional Chinese painter Wang Xuetao feels that the cultural leadership departments and art groups are sometimes cold and sometimes hot towards traditional Chinese painting, sometimes praising it and sometimes suppressing it. He believes that this is not a truly serious attitude towards valuing and supporting the art of traditional Chinese painting.

Traditional Chinese painters criticized the various phenomena of the Central Academy of Fine Arts not valuing traditional Chinese painting. Veteran traditional Chinese painters Gao Xishun and Li Kuchan recounted at the meeting their experiences of being discriminated against and marginalized at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Li Kuchan was even once assigned to the academy's trade union to buy theater tickets for everyone. Li Kuchan said that the Central Academy of Fine Arts has never properly resolved his work issues, making it impossible for him to give full play to his expertise. Traditional Chinese painter Tian Shiguang and others also criticized at the meeting that the sectarian emotions of the leaders of the Central Academy of Fine Arts damaged the enthusiasm of the academy's traditional Chinese painters, causing losses to the teaching work of traditional Chinese painting.

Traditional Chinese painters raised many opinions on the Chinese Artists Association. They feel that the association's absorption of members is sometimes loose and sometimes tight, without a certain standard. Some old traditional Chinese painters are often distressed because they are not admitted to the association. Traditional Chinese painter Yan Di said: It is very unfair for some people to subjectively think that traditional Chinese painters are backward, and their progress should be seen.

Traditional Chinese painters appealed for a way out for traditional Chinese painting. Yan Di suggested setting up more places to sell traditional Chinese paintings. He said that this would have a good effect on the prosperity of traditional Chinese painting creation. Zhai Fengnan, deputy director of the Beijing Traditional Chinese Painting Production Cooperative, said that the cooperative has made certain achievements in encouraging the creative enthusiasm of traditional Chinese painters and meeting the social needs for traditional Chinese painting, but it has not been valued by the cultural departments. At present, it is actually in a state of no leadership, which is not good for the further development of the cooperative's work.

Traditional Chinese painters also hope that literary and art publications and newspapers will pay more attention to the creation of traditional Chinese painting, and at the same time publish more articles by traditional Chinese painters, so as to open up a "contending" garden for the traditional Chinese painting circle.

More than 70 traditional Chinese painters and art figures participated in today's symposium.

    国画这朵花为什么开得不好？
    国画家们对文化部和美术学院提出批评
    新华社18日讯“为什么国画这朵花至今还不曾很好开放”？这是几位老国画家今天在文化部和中国美术家协会在北京召开的一次座谈会上说的，他们说，“一朵好花，没有阳光雨露也会枯萎的”。国画家潘絜兹认为国画家的队伍很大，由于这几年来没有得到妥善安排，把许多力量都抵消掉了。国画家王雪涛觉得文化领导部门和美术团体对国画时冷时热，有时候捧它一下，有时候压它一下，他认为这不是真正重视、扶植国画艺术的态度。
    国画家们指责了中央美术学院不重视国画的种种现象。老国画家高希舜和李苦禅在会上叙述了他们在中央美术学院备受排挤、歧视的遭遇。李苦禅甚至一度被派到学院工会去给大家代买戏票。李苦禅说，中央美术学院始终没有很好解决他的工作问题，使他不能发挥专长。国画家田世光等人也在会上批评了由于中央美术学院领导人的宗派情绪而损害了院内国画家的积极性，使国画教学工作受到损失。
    国画家们对中国美术家协会提出了不少意见。他们觉得协会吸收会员时宽时紧，没有一定标准。有些老国画家常常由于自己不被吸收入会而苦恼。国画家颜地说：某些人主观地认为国画家落后是很不公平的，应该看到他们的进步。
    国画家们为国画的出路呼吁。颜地建议多多设立销售国画的场所。他说，这对繁荣国画创作会起良好作用。北京市国画生产合作社副主任翟奉南说，合作社在鼓舞国画家的创作热情，满足社会对国画的需要等方面已经作出一定成绩，可是并没有得到文化部门的重视，目前，实际上处于没有领导的状况，对合作社工作进一步开展没有好处。
    国画家们还希望文艺刊物和报纸在重视国画创作的同时，多多发表国画家的文章，为国画界开辟“争鸣”园地。
    参加今天座谈会的有七十多位国画家和美术界人士。
