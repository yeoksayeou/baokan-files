“The East Wind Brings a Hundred Flowers Blooming Everywhere”
The Academy of Sciences Invites Scientists to Discuss Contradictions in Scientific Work

(Our newspaper's report) President Guo Moruo stated at a symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on April 30th that the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has already presented a magnificent scene of "the east wind brings a hundred flowers blooming everywhere" in our country's academic circles. He said, "I hope that everyone, in accordance with this correct policy of resolving contradictions among the people, will unreservedly raise opinions on the errors and shortcomings existing in the work of the Academy of Sciences, and on how to improve it, so that our work can be done as well as possible and make as few mistakes as possible."

The scientists who attended the meeting, in an atmosphere of speaking their minds freely, pointed out the problems of bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism in the work of the Academy of Sciences, and put forward many positive suggestions for solving these problems.

"The bureaucracy of the Academy of Sciences is not the first, but it can be regarded as the second"

When talking about the bureaucracy of the Academy of Sciences, experimental biologist Bing Zhi first mentioned that when graduate student examination papers were submitted to the Cadre Training Bureau of the Academy of Sciences in 1956, there were no results for half a year. He said: "I think this is bureaucracy. May I ask if the Cadre Training Bureau is guilty of this?" Philosopher Feng Youlan said: "The bureaucracy of the Academy of Sciences is not the first, but it can be regarded as the second." He also used specific examples from the Institute of Philosophy to explain this. Botanist Hu Xiansu said that he had done leadership work for more than 20 years in the past, and now he is being led, so he is always willing to put forward any opinions he has on the leadership, but many opinions do not receive any response after being put forward. Archaeologist Xia Nai pointed out that the Academy of Sciences leads the various research institutes, but in reality, the institutes do not receive specific leadership, making it difficult to carry out work, as is the case with the Institute of Archaeology. Philosopher Jin Yuelin said that there are contradictions between the Academy and the institutes, which is first manifested in the lack of communication between the Academy and the institutes, and therefore the Academy cannot promote the work of the institutes. Historian Jian Bozan believes that the bureaucracy in the leadership of scientific work is manifested in using what seems to be a movement method to engage in science, and only stays at the state of shouting slogans, so that some first-year university students do not study basic courses well, but are busy "writing papers." Microbiologist Fang Xinfang particularly mentioned the bureaucracy of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Academy, such as the research on preventing mildew on wires, which was carried out in cooperation with many units for more than two years, but now suddenly received a notice to stop doing it and instead engage in "research on bactericidal drugs." What is the reason for this, making people confused. He said that there are many other things that also make people feel "confused." Linguist Fu Maoji mentioned that there is a gap between the Academy and the institutes, so that the lower levels are not even clear about the division of labor among the leaders of the Academy. The leadership should find ways to link the institutes with the Academy, and the departments should take the initiative to promote the work of the institutes. The departments can consider setting up several groups to go deep into the relevant institutes to understand the situation and study the problems in the institutes in a timely manner. Geologist Hou Defeng talked about the situation of the Academy of Sciences' leadership being busy with expanding the scale, so that institutions have been established one after another, and the number is considerable, but no one seems to care whether actual research work has been done. Scientists such as Fang Jun and Zhong Pukiu also mentioned the issue of bureaucracy.

Opposing dogmatism, we must convince people with reason

Many scientists talked about dogmatism in scientific work. Botanist Hu Xiansu cited the situation in their business studies, once studying "evolution," because the results of everyone's discussion did not conform to the views of a certain school, it was said that the study was not well led. Everyone could not listen to it. Another study was also only "one family sings," and someone expressed different opinions on Lysenko's science in the Soviet Union, and they had to "examine themselves." Economist Wu Baoshan said that there is very little academic discussion in the economics field, and everyone is unwilling to say what they think. Some schools have now opened Keynesian economics, the purpose of which seems to be to criticize it, but it can also be considered whether there is anything we can absorb from it. Jian Bozan mentioned that a young man wanted to criticize an article by Guo Lao, but only used a few empty words to negate it, without providing solid arguments. How can this convince people? For example, the application of the "workload" system, how can scientific research work be compared with factory workshops? This is also a manifestation of dogmatism.

Dismantle sectarian "walls," Communist Party members must take the lead

Jian Bozan said that the issue of sectarianism should also be raised. Sectarianism does seem like a wall standing between party members and non-party members. At present, the wall is shorter, but it has not yet become a line. To dismantle the wall, both sides must take action, and Communist Party members must take the lead. The problem is that many old intellectuals are still discriminated against, and the party's trust in them is not enough. He hopes that the "wall" will be dismantled as soon as possible, preferably completely. Biologist Shi Luji felt that the reason for the gap between inside and outside the party is mutual misunderstanding. He said that everyone should meet frankly and openly, and the situation will improve. Wu Baoshan talked about the sectarianism in the economics field is also very serious. In economics, there is a wall, not a low wall, but a wall where you can't hear sounds on both sides, which divides new and old economists very clearly. For example, some meetings, old economists did not participate, not because they were unwilling to come, but because they were not invited at all. Other scientists also talked about some situations where there was a gap between the party and non-party members.

The Academy of Sciences and universities work together, which is beneficial to both parties

Regarding the issue of how the Academy of Sciences and universities should cooperate, many people expressed their opinions. Bing Zhi said that the Academy of Sciences and universities should work together, so that schools can get teachers and scientific research can get fresh troops. Feng Youlan said: The boundaries between the Academy and the schools should not be too clear. The Academy of Sciences, production departments, and universities should be integrated into one. This can not only solve the difficulty of insufficient manpower, but also change the situation where problems found in teaching by schools in the past had no time to research, and scientific researchers had time but could not grasp the problems. Jian Bozan also believes that it can also be allowed that qualified universities run their own research institutes, and the Academy of Sciences does not have to take on all the work.

"Scientists' time is more important than anything else"

At the meeting, everyone believed that the Party and the state have already taken good care of senior intellectuals in life, but the most important research time, books and materials, and scientific information for scientific work have not been paid enough attention to. Many participants felt deeply that the time for scientific research was not guaranteed. Hou Wailu said: Scientists' time is more important than anything else. The main increase in production and economy in the scientific community is time. It was once proposed to guarantee five-sixths of the research time, but the ideology is still not valued, and much time is occupied by meetings, disrupting scientific research work. Xia Nai said that many comrades are not guaranteed five-sixths of their time, and he suggested that fewer meetings should be held. Hou Xueyu said that this problem also exists for young comrades, and sometimes experiments are interrupted in order to hold trade union meetings. Some people deeply regret that the Academy of Sciences does not pay attention to publishing social science information. The opinion of relaxing the scope of confidentiality was also more common at the meeting, such as Wu Baoshan said: The main research on China's economy lies in the study of the current economy, but researchers cannot obtain data, so dogmatism replaces actual materials, and research work is bound to lag behind reality.

Scientific research is hard work

Hou Wailu felt deeply about the work style of scientific workers and the lack of understanding of the arduousness of scientific research by young people. He said: Doing science cannot be like doing armed struggle, adopting the method of charging into battle, not to mention that our armed revolution also went through a process of accumulating experience for two or thirty years. If you think that science can be achieved quickly, this is to underestimate science.

The symposium ended at 6 pm, and will continue on May 3. More than 50 scientific workers from the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences, the compilation and publishing departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scientific workers were invited to participate in the symposium.

Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Zhou Yang and others also participated in the symposium.

### “东风到处百花开”  科学院邀请科学家座谈科学工作中的矛盾

    “东风到处百花开”
    科学院邀请科学家座谈科学工作中的矛盾
    本报讯  郭沫若院长在中国科学院4月30日召开的座谈会上说，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，已使我国学术界呈现了一片“东风到处百花开”的壮丽景色。他说，希望大家本着这个解决人民内部矛盾的正确方针，无顾忌地对科学院工作中存在的错误和缺点，以及如何改进的意见，都尽量提出来，好使我们的工作尽量做得好，尽量少犯错误。”
    到会的科学家们在畅所欲言的气氛下，指出了科学院工作中的官僚主义、教条主义、宗派主义等问题，并提出了不少积极的解决这些问题的意见。
    “科学院的官僚主义不算第一，也可以算第二”
    谈起科学院的官僚主义，实验生物学家秉志首先提到1956年招考研究生时，考卷评好送给科学院干部培养局，半年没结果。他说：“我认为这就是官僚主义，请问干部培养局是不是？”哲学家冯友兰说：“科学院的官僚主义不算第一，也可以算第二。”他并举哲学研究所的具体例子作了说明。植物学家胡先驌说，他过去做过二十多年的领导工作，现在是被领导，所以他对领导上有什么意见总愿意提出来，可是许多意见提了以后就得不到什么反应。考古学家夏鼐提出，科学院是领导各研究所的，实际上所里得不到具体的领导，以致很难开展工作，如考古研究所就是这样的。哲学家金岳霖说，院与所之间是有矛盾的，这首先就表现在院与所的不接头，因而院推不动所的工作。历史学家翦伯赞认为科学工作领导上的官僚主义，表现在用似乎是搞运动的方法来搞科学，并且只停留在喊口号的状态，以致有的大学一年级的学生不好好学习基础课，而要忙“写论文”了。微生物学家方心芳特别提到院里生物学地学学部的官僚主义，如关于防止电线发霉的研究，同许多单位协作进行了两年多，现在突然接到通知叫不要搞了，另外搞“杀菌药物的研究”，这是什么理由，使人莫名其妙。他说还有许多事，也都使人感到“莫名其妙”。语言学家傅懋绩提到，院与所之间有隔膜，以致下面连院里领导者之间的分工都不清楚。领导上应该设法使所同院挂上钩，学部应该主动推动所的工作。学部可以考虑分设若干组，深入有关所了解情况，及时研究所里问题。地质学家侯德封谈到科学院领导上忙于铺摊子的情况，以致机构纷纷建立了，数目很可观，可是实际做了研究工作没有，似乎无人过问。方俊、钟朴求等科学家也提到了官僚主义问题。
    反对教条主义，必须以理服人
    许多科学家都谈到了科学工作中的教条主义。植物学家胡先驌举了他们学习业务中的情况，一次学习“进化论”，因为大家讨论的结果不符某一学派的观点，就说学习没领导好。大家很听不进去。又一次学习，也是只能“一家独鸣”，有人对苏联李森科学说表示了不同意见，就要“检讨”。经济学家巫宝山说，经济学界在学术上的讨论就很少，大家有什么意见都不愿说。现在有的学校开了凯恩斯的经济学，目的似乎是为了批判，但也可以考虑到它里面有没有我们可以吸取的地方。翦伯赞提到，一位青年想批判郭老的一篇文章，只搬用了几句空话就加以否定，而拿不出切实的论据，这如何使人信服。又如“工作量”制度的搬用，科学研究工作那能同工厂车间比呢？这也就是教条主义的表现。
    拆除宗派主义“墙壁”，共产党员要先动手
    翦伯赞说，宗派主义问题还应该提出来。宗派主义的确好像一堵墙立于党员与非党员之间。目前墙是矮了一些，但还没有成一条线。要把墙拆除，得双方动手，共产党员要先动手。问题在于许多旧知识分子还受到歧视，党对他们的信任还不够。他希望“墙”拆得越快越好，最好完全拆除。生物学家施履吉感到，党内党外隔膜的原因是互不了解。他说大家要开诚布公地见面，情况就会好转。巫宝山谈到经济学界的宗派主义也很严重。在经济学中，有着一座墙，不是低墙，而是两边听不见声音的墙，它把新旧经济学家划分得很清楚。即如一些会议，旧经济学家们没有参加，不是他们不愿来，而是根本不请他们来。其他科学家也谈到了党与非党之间有隔膜的一些情况。
    科学院和高等学校打成一片，双方有利
    关于科学院和高等学校如何合作的问题，很多人发表了意见。秉志说，科学院和高等学校应该打成一片，这样学校可以得到师资，科学研究也可得到生力军。冯友兰说：院和校的界限不要划得太清，科学院、生产部门和高等学校应该三位一体，这不但可以解决人力不足的困难，而且过去学校方面在教学中发现的问题无时间研究、科学研究者有时间却又抓不到问题的情况就可得以改变。翦伯赞并认为，也可以允许有条件的高等学校自己办研究所，科学院不必把所有的工作都揽下来。
    “科学家的时间比什么都重要”
    会上大家都认为目前党和国家对高级知识分子生活上的照顾已很多很好，但对科学工作最紧要的研究时间、图书资料和科学情报，却还注意得不够。不少与会者对于科学研究的时间得不到保证感触极深。侯外庐说：科学家的时间比什么都重要，科学界的增产节约主要是时间，过去曾提出过保证六分之五的研究时间，但思想上还不重视，许多时间被会议占去，科学研究工作被打乱了。夏鼐说，现在有许多同志得不到六分之五的保证，他建议会议应该少开。侯学煜说，这个问题青年同志也同样存在，有时为了开工会的会议便中断了实验。有些人对于科学院不注意出版社会科学方面的情报深感遗憾。会上要求放宽保密的范围的意见也比较普遍，如巫宝山说：研究中国经济主要在于研究当前的经济，但研究工作者没法取得资料，这样教条主义就代替了实际材料，研究工作就必然落后于现实了。
    科学研究是艰巨的工作
    侯外庐对于科学工作者的作风和青年对科学研究的艰巨性认识不足很有感触。他说：搞科学不能像搞武装斗争那样，采取冲锋陷阵的办法，何况我们的武装革命也是先经过二、三十年的积累经验的过程。如果认为科学可以速成，这是轻视了科学。
    座谈会在下午六时结束，5月3日将继续举行。应邀参加座谈会的有中国科学院哲学社会科学学部、生物学地学学部、编译出版部门的科学工作者和其它科学工作者五十多人。
    国务院聂荣臻副总理、中共中央宣传部副部长周扬等也参加了座谈会。
