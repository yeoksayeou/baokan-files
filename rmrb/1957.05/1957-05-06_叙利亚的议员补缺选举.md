Syria's parliament is the highest legislative body in the country. Members of parliament are directly elected by the people for a term of four years. The parliament elects the president. The president has the power to dissolve parliament, appoint the prime minister, and, based on the prime minister's recommendations, decide on the appointment and removal of cabinet ministers.

The current parliament was elected in October 1954 and has a total of one hundred and forty-two members. In this general election, nationalist forces achieved victory, and pro-Western forces suffered a major setback. The current cabinet, formed in December of last year with Asali as prime minister, is composed of the National Party, the Arab Ba'ath Party, and non-partisan independents, all of whom oppose imperialism, advocate national independence, and implement a foreign policy of peace and neutrality. The current cabinet enjoys the support of a majority of members of parliament.

In February of this year, the Syrian government uncovered a treasonous plot to overthrow the current government. Four members of parliament were convicted for participating in treasonous activities, and their qualifications as members of parliament were revoked, necessitating by-elections. Because these four members of parliament were elected from the four cities of Damascus, Homs, Suwayda, and the Druze Mountain City, the by-elections held on May 4 will elect new members of parliament from these four cities.

Left-wing and right-wing forces are competing for these four seats. Encouraged by the United States' orchestration of the Jordan incident, the various right-wing parties have for the first time jointly formed an organization called the "United National Front" to conduct the election campaign. The right-wing coalition includes the People's Party, the Muslim Brotherhood, some splinter factions of the National Party, and some right-wing non-partisans. Left-wing parties have jointly formed the "National Front," which includes the National Party, the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and left-wing non-partisans.

This by-election will not fundamentally change the balance of power in parliament, but the potential impact of this election, held amidst the current turbulent situation in the Middle East, on Syria's political trends has received widespread attention.

U.S. officials and Western news agencies attach great importance to this Syrian parliamentary by-election. They hope that the right-wing forces can win in order to strengthen their power in parliament, thereby "seizing power and causing Syria to take the anti-communist path taken by Jordan."

    叙利亚的议员补缺选举
    叙利亚的议会是国家的最高立法机关。议员是由人民直接选举产生的，任期四年。议会选举总统。总统有权解散议会，任命总理，并根据总理的意见决定内阁各部部长的任免。
    本届议会是在1954年10月选出的，共有一百四十二名议员。这次大选结果，民族主义力量取得了胜利，亲西方势力遭到很大的挫折。去年12月组成的以阿萨利为总理的现内阁，就是由反对帝国主义、主张民族独立、实行和平中立的外交政策的国民党、阿拉伯复兴党，以及无党派独立人士组成的。现内阁得到了议会中多数议员的支持。
    今年2月间，叙利亚政府破获了阴谋推翻现政府的叛国案，有四名议员因参加叛国活动而被判刑，他们的议员资格也被取消，需要补选。由于这四个议员是从大马士革、霍姆斯、苏韦达和德鲁士山城四个城市选出的，所以，5月4日举行的议会补缺选举，就要从这四个城市中选出新的议员。
    左翼和右翼力量竞争着这四个议席。各右翼党派在美国策动约旦事件的鼓舞下，第一次联合组成了一个叫做“联合民族阵线”的机构来进行竞选。参加这个右翼联合阵线的包括：人民党、穆斯林兄弟会、国民党的一些分裂派和一些右翼无党派人士。左翼党派联合组成了“民族阵线”，其中包括：国民党、阿拉伯复兴社会党、共产党和左翼无党派人士。
    这次补缺选举，对议会中力量的对比不会发生根本变化，但是在当前动荡的中东局势下举行的这次选举对叙利亚的政治动向可能发生的影响，受到普遍的注意。
    美国官员和西方通讯社对这次叙利亚议会补缺选举极为重视，他们希望右派势力能够取胜，以便加强它们在议会中的力量，从而“取得政权和使叙利亚走约旦所采取的反共道路”。
