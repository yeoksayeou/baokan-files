    Odds and Ends

    Donating Fertilizer to Agricultural Cooperatives
    The staff of the newly built Jilin Fertilizer Plant donated their first batch of trial-produced chemical fertilizer to the farmer brothers of the Chaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Jilin City on the 7th.

    When the truck loaded with chemical fertilizer – ammonium nitrate – arrived at Chaoguang Cooperative, Korean members dressed in bright national costumes came out to welcome them warmly and performed Korean folk songs and dances.

    They Need to Learn Culture
    Fan Yong, a deputy to the National People's Congress, recently returned from an inspection tour of the Changbai Mountain forest area. He believes that relevant departments should consider the problem of cultural learning for forestry workers. Many workers are reading small books with pictures in the evenings, but most of them only look at the pictures and not the words, because there are many illiterate people among the workers. At the same time, the workers also have a lot of opinions about the commercial departments transporting some outdated and unpopular goods to the forest area for promotion.

    The Fourth Bridge Across the Yellow River
    The perilous Yellow River divides Lanzhou City into two parts, which has always been a major obstacle to transportation in Lanzhou City. Before liberation, there was only one narrow iron bridge here. From 1954 to the end of last year, three large bridges have been built: the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Hekou Yellow River Iron Bridge, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Shili Mountain Yellow River Arch Bridge, and the Shajingyi Wooden Pontoon Bridge. Now, Lanzhou City is building the fourth reinforced concrete highway bridge across the Yellow River at Qilihe.

    东鳞西爪
    赠肥料给农业社
    新建吉林肥料厂职工在7日把他们试生产的第一批化学肥料，赠送给吉林市市郊朝光农业生产合作社的农民兄弟。
    当满载化学肥料——硝铵的汽车到了朝光社的时候，穿着鲜艳民族服装的朝鲜族社员，热情地出来欢迎，还表演了朝鲜民族歌舞。
    他们需要学文化
    全国人民代表大会代表范永最近从长白山林区视察回来，他认为有关部门应该考虑林业工人的文化学习问题。很多工人晚上都在看带画的小书，但是其中大多数人只看画，不看字，因为工人中间文盲很多。同时，商业部门把一些过时的冷背货运到林区去推销，工人们也很有意见。
    第四座横跨黄河的桥
    天险黄河把兰州市分割成两个部分，一直是兰州市交通运输的大障碍。在解放前，这里只有一座狭窄的铁桥，从1954年到去年年底，已经建成了三座大桥：兰新路河口黄河大铁桥、包兰路十里山黄河大拱桥、沙井驿木便桥。现在，兰州市又在修建第四横跨黄河的七里河钢筋混凝土公路桥。
