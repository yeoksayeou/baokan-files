Another Step in Destroying the Geneva Accords
*People's Daily* Commentator

The talks between the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem have concluded. A characteristic of these talks is that they made no mention whatsoever of the Geneva Conference agreements regarding the Indochina issue.

The provision in the Geneva Accords for the unification of Vietnam through general elections has not been realized to this day. This is the result of deliberate obstruction by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique with the support of the United States. During these talks, Ngo Dinh Diem expressed tearful gratitude for the support given to him by the United States, while the United States greatly praised Ngo Dinh Diem's obstruction of unification, vividly portraying a scene of collusion. However, the United States is not satisfied with the current situation; it demands that the Ngo Dinh Diem group become a more active pawn on the chessboard of American efforts to create tension in Asia. The Ngo Dinh Diem group's recent participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's "Maritime Liaison Exercise" indicates that the United States is elevating it from a "protected" entity of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to a participant in the group. The Ngo Dinh Diem group is also being used as a tool by the United States to exert pressure on Cambodia. The Ngo Dinh Diem group, well aware of the "reliance" the United States has on it, also wants to take the opportunity to obtain more "aid" from the United States to maintain its unstable rule. The talks between the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem began against this backdrop.

In Washington, Ngo Dinh Diem held talks not only with Eisenhower but also with the State Department and military authorities. Judging from the communique issued after the talks, Ngo Dinh Diem did not obtain the amount of dollars he had hoped for. According to the Associated Press, the United States has already given the Ngo Dinh Diem group $750 million in the past three years. Some members of the American ruling clique are opposing increasing "aid" to the Ngo Dinh Diem group. Therefore, all Ngo Dinh Diem received in this regard was an empty promise of "continued effective assistance within the procedures of the American Constitution."

What Ngo Dinh Diem truly obtained was a rope that tied him even more tightly to the American war chariot. The communique reiterated that South Vietnam is within the "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. According to United Press International, this "protection" for Ngo Dinh Diem effectively has the same effect as a "mutual security treaty." Although the communique also stated that they expect to end the division of Vietnam, they made no mention whatsoever of the Geneva Accords for the peaceful resolution of the issue of Vietnamese unification, but instead spoke of "seeking appropriate means" to "promote" unification. Clearly, this meeting is just another step by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to destroy the Geneva Accords. The United States is attempting to tightly control South Vietnam through the Ngo Dinh Diem group, deepening the division of Vietnam in order to create tension in Vietnam and throughout Indochina. The United States was a participant in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. Although it did not sign the Geneva Accords, it guaranteed that it would not undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords. South Vietnam, on the other hand, inherited the obligations France undertook in the Geneva Accords. Now they are openly defying the Geneva Accords, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam, which will pose a serious threat to peace in Indochina and Asia.

However, the communique of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem attempts to portray this threat to peace as coming from China, slandering China for "refusing to renounce the use of force." At a time when the United States is doing its utmost to create tension in Asia and occupying China's territory of Taiwan with missile forces, what other result can the United States achieve by repeating such hackneyed slanders against the Chinese people other than making a laughingstock of itself?

    破坏日内瓦协议的又一个步骤	本报评论员
    美国同吴庭艳之间的会谈已经结束。这次会谈的特点，就是他们都绝口不提日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的协议。
    日内瓦协议中关于通过普选实现越南统一的规定，直到今天都还没有实现。这是吴庭艳集团在美国支持之下蓄意阻挠的结果。吴庭艳在这次会谈中对于美国给他的支持表示感激涕零，而美国则对于吴庭艳阻挠统一的行为大加恭维，活画出了一幅狼狈为奸的神气。但是，美国并不以目前的情况为满足，它要求吴庭艳集团成为美国在亚洲制造紧张局势的棋盘上的一着更活跃的棋子。吴庭艳集团的代表最近参加东南亚条约集团的“海上联系行动”演习，说明美国正在使它从东南亚集团的被“保护”者，上升为这个集团的参加者。吴庭艳集团也在被利用来作为美国对柬埔寨施加压力的工具。而吴庭艳集团深知美国对它的“倚重”，也想趁机从美国得到更多的“援助”，来维持它的不稳的统治。美国和吴庭艳之间的会谈，就是在这样的背景下开始的。
    吴庭艳在华盛顿不仅同艾森豪威尔、而且同国务院和军事当局都进行了会谈。从会谈以后所发表的公报看来，吴庭艳并没有得到他所希望的数目的美元。据美联社说，在过去三年之中，美国已经给了吴庭艳集团七亿五千万美元。美国统治集团中有人正在反对增加给吴庭艳集团的“援助”。因此，吴庭艳在这方面所得到的，只是“在美国宪法的程序范围内继续提供有效援助”这样一句空洞的诺言。
    吴庭艳真正得到的是一条把他更紧地套在美国战车上的绳索。公报重申了越南南部在东南亚集团的“保护”范围之内。据合众社解释说，对吴庭艳的这种“保护”，这实际上具有和一个“共同安全条约”相同的效力。公报虽然也说他们期望结束越南的分裂局面，可是他们却根本不提和平解决越南统一问题的日内瓦协议，却说要“谋求合适的手段”来“促进”统一。很明显，这次会谈只是美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的又一个步骤。美国企图把越南南部通过吴庭艳集团紧紧控制在自己手里，加深越南的分裂，以便在越南和整个印度支那制造紧张局势。美国是关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加者，虽然它没有在日内瓦协议上签字，可是它保证过不破坏日内瓦协议的实施。越南南部则继承了法国在日内瓦协议上所承担的义务。现在它们公然蔑视日内瓦协议，企图永久分裂越南，这将对印度支那和亚洲和平形成严重的威胁。
    可是，美国和吴庭艳的公报却企图把这种对和平的威胁说成是来自中国，诬蔑中国“拒绝放弃使用武力”。正当美国在亚洲竭力制造紧张局势、用导弹部队占领中国领土台湾的时候，美国重复这种诬蔑中国人民的陈腔滥调，除了贻笑天下以外，还能有什么别的结果呢？
