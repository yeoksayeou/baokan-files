    Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute's Rectification Leading Group invited engineering and technical personnel of the institute to a forum on the 13th, 16th, and 18th. A total of twenty-two people spoke at the meeting, criticizing the subjectivism of the Ministry of Coal Industry and the State Construction Commission.

    The Design Direction Swings Back and Forth
    Engineers Li Yunfeng, Tuo Shilu, and Yu Zaiping said: At present, the most troubling thing for design personnel is that the direction of construction design keeps swinging back and forth. Li Yunfeng said that the Coal Design Institute has experienced several "winds" in recent years, either winds of cutting investment or winds of increasing investment. When the wind blows, the ministry makes rigid decisions to increase or cut investment without sufficient basis, resulting in unnecessary losses and increased investment. For example, when the wind of increasing investment blew, it was rigidly stipulated that mine cars should be equipped at 40% of the designed annual output, but some mines not only could not use so many mine cars, but there was no place to put them. Tuo Shilu said that the Design Review Division of the Ministry of Coal handles affairs according to the wind direction and intentions. We are unwilling to be the tail of bureaucracy and have opinions, but they simply don't listen, saying, "These issues are decided by the minister, you just modify the design."

    Where Does the Young Master Style Come From?
    Tuo Shilu said: Recently, Vice Premier Bo Yibo made a speech, "We must rectify the young master style," which is absolutely necessary. But to rectify the young master style, we must find out where it comes from. He believes that it comes from comrades engaged in specific capital construction on the one hand, and from the standards issued by the state on the other. For example, in March 1956, the "Provisional Sanitary Standards for Industrial Enterprise Design" approved by the State Construction Commission and the Ministry of Health stipulated that "nursing rooms" and "smoking rooms" could be built. Designing the administration and welfare of coal mines according to this standard will inevitably be criticized for being too high. Therefore, when the state issues or approves any "standards" and regulations, it must first check how much money is in its pocket.

    Is a Large Mine Good or a Small Mine Good?
    He said that Director Bo Yibo's opposition to the one-sided view that the larger the mine, the better is completely correct, but affirming that a small mine is better than a large mine is also one-sided. He believes that Bo Yibo's statement that the cost of raw coal per ton is twelve yuan for central government-owned coal mines, nine yuan for provincial government-owned coal mines, and five yuan for county government-owned coal mines is too general and cannot explain the problem in detail. Because we understand that the specific production conditions of county-owned coal mines with a cost of five yuan and some state-owned coal mines are very different. If we only talk about costs, it is easy to have side effects on some people who are not familiar with coal mine business or have a bureaucratic style in coal mine enterprise management. He believes that whether China's coal industry can catch up with the world level depends on whether we can build mines with an annual output of more than three million tons in conditional areas during the second and third five-year plans.

    Regarding whether to build large mines or small mines? Should we focus on large mines and supplement with small mines, or focus on small mines and supplement with large mines? These two questions sparked heated debate at the forum. Engineer Hua Shuntian said that the mine output is mainly determined by natural conditions such as coal seam bedding conditions, reserves, and topography. It is economically reasonable to build large mines in area A, and it may be cheaper to build small mines in area B. It cannot be generalized.

    Engineer Weng Sichao also believes that the decision of the mine type cannot start from subjective wishes, nor can it start from initial investment, but also take into account later costs and expanded reproduction and other factors. If we say that because there is currently less investment, no large equipment, and a lack of steel, we will not build large mines, this approach is not necessarily entirely correct. For example, the large belt conveyor mine we designed is not necessarily more expensive than a small mine with the same output and the same geological conditions.

    Numerous Regulations, Out of Touch with Reality
    Engineer Wang Zhaochun said that there are no less than dozens of regulations, directions, norms, and standards that we must abide by in mine design, and the Ministry, the Construction Committee, the Planning Committee, and other departments issue them in the nature of instructions. These articles are rigidly stipulated, have contradictions with each other, are inconsistent in spirit, and are out of touch with reality. At the same time, because these articles are issued in a commanding manner, they do not allow debate and limit the enthusiasm of technical personnel. For example, the safety regulations are basically copied from the Soviet Union's 1953 regulations, which exceed the current national material conditions. However, because it is under the big hat of safety, everyone is afraid to touch it. If anyone raises different opinions, the other party only needs to ask, "Can you guarantee safety?" to scare others back. This has fueled dogmatism and created a lot of confusion. Engineer Yuan Guobin said: Due to the restrictions of the rules, designers do not need to use their brains, as long as they pull a slide rule and check the technical direction, they can decide the fate of millions of yuan of funds and hundreds of tons of materials in three minutes. How can this allow engineering and technical personnel to catch up with the world's advanced technical level in twelve years?

    Flattering Reviews
    Engineering and technical personnel reflected that when the Ministry of Coal reviews and appraises foreign designs, it rarely raises any modification opinions on the shortcomings of the design, and usually praises it. Tuo Shilu said: It is said that this is to avoid affecting international relations. I don't think this is necessary. Foreign experts do not approve of this practice. After a foreign design review meeting, the deputy leader of our institute's Soviet expert group said to us: "This is not a review meeting, it is a flattering meeting."

    Engineer Yu Zaiping also has opinions on the appraisal office. An engineer told him: "There is a young woman in the office who just graduated from school to appraise the design made by engineers with more than ten years of experience; she cannot answer the opinions we raise, and she not only does not take me to the meeting of the Construction Committee when I ask her to, but also does not allow me to speak."

### 北京煤矿设计院工程技术人员  批评煤炭部和建委的主观主义

    北京煤矿设计院工程技术人员
    批评煤炭部和建委的主观主义
    本报讯　北京煤矿设计院整风领导小组在13、16、18三天分别邀请本院工程技术人员座谈。会上发言的共有二十二人，对煤炭工业部和国家建设委员会的主观主义提出了批评。
    设计方向左右摇摆
    李蕴峰、脱师禄和于在平等工程师说：目前设计人员感到最苦恼的是建设设计方向摆来摆去。李蕴峰说，几年来，煤炭设计院刮过几次风，不是刮削减投资风，就是刮增加投资风。风一刮来，部里对许多问题都没有充分的根据，就硬性决定增加或削减投资，结果造成了不应有的损失，使投资加大。如刮增加投资风的时候，就硬性规定按设计年产量40％配备矿车，可是有的矿井不仅用不了这么多矿车，连放的地方都没有了。脱师禄说，煤炭部设计审核处靠风向意图办事。我们不愿意当官僚主义的尾巴，有意见，但他们根本不听，说：“这些问题，由部长决定，你们只管修改设计就行了。”
    大少爷作风从何而来
    脱师禄说：最近薄一波副总理发表谈话，“要整掉大少爷作风”，这是完全必要的。但要整掉大少爷作风就必须弄清它是从哪里来的。他认为一方面来自搞具体基本建设的同志，另一方面来自国家颁发的标准。如1956年3月，国家建设委员会和卫生部批准的工业企业设计暂行卫生标准中，规定了可以建“哺乳室”、“吸烟室”。按照这个标准在煤矿的行政和福利中设计，一定会遭到标准太高的批评。因此国家在颁发或批准什么“标准”和规程时，一定要摸摸自己口袋里有多少钱。
    大井好还是小井好？
    他说，薄一波主任反对片面地对待井型越大越好的观点，这是完全正确的，但是肯定小型井要比大型井好的话，同样也是带有片面性。他认为薄一波说的中央所属的煤矿原煤成本每吨十二元，省属九元，县属五元的说法比较笼统，不能详细说明问题。因为我们了解到县属煤原成本五元的煤矿和国营煤矿的一些具体生产情况是很不同的，如果只从成本谈问题，很容易使一些不熟悉煤矿业务的人或对煤矿企业管理有官僚主义作风的人起副作用的。他认为，我国煤炭工业能不能赶上世界水平，要看我们是不是能在第二个、第三个五年计划期间，在有条件的地区，建设一些年产三百万吨以上的矿井来决定。
    关于建大井抑或小井？以大井为主小井为辅抑或以小井为主大井为辅？这两个问题，在座谈会上引起热烈的争论。华顺添工程师说，矿井产量主要根据煤层成层条件、储量和地形等自然条件而定，在甲区建大井经济合理，在乙区可能建小井便宜，不能一概而论。
    翁嗣超工程师也认为，井型的决定不能从主观愿望出发，也不能从初期投资出发，还要照顾到后期的成本和扩大再生产等因素。如果说因为目前投资少、没有大型设备、缺乏钢材就不建大井的话，这种做法不一定全对。如我们设计的大型皮带井就不一定比同样产量、同样地质条件的小型井花钱多。
    规程繁多，脱离实际
    王兆椿工程师说，我们矿井设计要遵守的规程、方向、规范、标准等不下数十种，部、建委、计委等部门都是以指令性质下达的。这些条文，规定得很生硬而彼此有矛盾，精神不一致，又脱离实际。同时因为这些条文都是以命令方式下达的，不容许争辩，限制了技术人员的积极性。比如保安规程，基本上是照苏联1953年的规程抄录的，超过了当前国家物质允许条件。但是，因为它在保安这个大帽子之下，大家都不敢去碰它，谁要提出不同意见，对方只是提出“你能保证安全吗？”就可以把别人吓回去了。这样就助长了教条主义，制造了不少混乱。苑国滨工程师说：由于条条的限制，设计人员不用动脑筋，只要一拉计算尺，查一下技术方向，三分钟的时间就决定了上百万元的资金、数百吨的器材的命运。这怎能让工程技术人员在十二年内赶上世界先进技术水平？
      捧场的审核
    工程技术人员反映，煤炭部审查鉴定国外设计的时候，很少对设计缺点提出修改意见，照例是歌颂称赞一番。脱师禄说：据说这是怕影响了国际关系。我看这是不必要的。外国专家并不赞成这种作法。在一次国外设计审核会以后，我们院的苏联专家组副组长对我们说：“这哪儿是审核会，是捧场。”
    于在平工程师对鉴定处也有意见。有位工程师告诉他：“在处里有一位刚从学校毕业不久的女青年来鉴定我们有十几年经验的工程师作出的设计；我们提出意见她也不能回答，要求她带我去建委开会她不但不带，还不让我发言。”
