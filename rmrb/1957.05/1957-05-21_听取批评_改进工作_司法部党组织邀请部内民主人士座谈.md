    Listen to Criticism, Improve Work
    The Ministry of Justice Party Organization Invites Democratic Personages Within the Ministry to a Forum

    (Our dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party's Ministry of Justice Party Group and Party Committee held a forum on the morning of the 18th, inviting people from various democratic parties within the ministry. The speeches at the forum criticized the bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism of the Ministry of Justice. Li Daguang, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Ministry of Justice branch, stated that the Ministry of Justice, as a leading organ, had not kept up with the development of the objective situation and was always reacting after the fact on many issues. Leading comrades did not understand the work and did not study hard. When encountering problems, they could not come up with ideas; when handling problems, they overemphasized "stability" and could not produce anything concrete, while the localities were in great need of the Ministry of Justice's help. They provided little assistance to the lower levels, but offered much criticism, without providing correct standards for practice. Sun Wenquan, a member of the China Democratic League (CDL), stated: When he went down to inspect work, he found problems and wrote a report. If they had been studied and resolved earlier, it might have helped the work, but it was given to the director of the department and suppressed without any follow-up, resulting in inspections for the sake of inspections.

    Regarding Party-masses relations, some people said that the Party-masses relations in the Ministry of Justice had greatly improved in recent years, but they were not completely harmonious. Chen Yiqing, a member of the CDL, described it as: "There is a gentle breeze, a spring breeze, and also a cold wind." Cao Jie, chairman of the CDL Ministry of Justice branch, also analyzed in his speech that the lack of harmonious Party-masses relations was because some young Communist Party members did not understand the revolutionary history of China over the past thirty years and did not understand the contributions of the various democratic parties to the revolutionary cause. He suggested that young Communist Party members should carefully study documents related to united front work.

    听取批评　改进工作
    司法部党组织邀请部内民主人士座谈
    本报讯　中共司法部党组和党委会18日上午，邀请部内各民主党派人士举行座谈会。座谈会的发言，对司法部的官僚主义、教条主义和宗派主义提出了批评。民革司法部支部委员李大光谈到，司法部作为领导机关，没有跟上客观形势的发展，在许多问题上都是放马后炮。领导同志不懂业务，又不好好钻研。遇到问题，拿不出主意；处理问题，过分强调“稳”，拿不出东西来，而地方却很需要司法部的帮助。对下面，帮助少，批评多，可是又没有正确做法的标准。民盟成员孙文铨谈到：他下去检查工作，发现的问题，回来写了报告，如果早研究解决，对工作可能有帮助，可是交给司长，一压就没有下文，形成了为检查而检查。
    党群关系方面，有人谈到，司法部近几年来党群关系有很大改善，可是也不是融洽无间。民盟成员陈一清形容为：“有和风，有春风，也有寒风”。民盟司法部支部主任委员曹杰在发言中还分析党群关系不够融洽，是因为有些年青的共产党员还不了解中国近三十年来革命历史，不了解各民主党派在革命事业中的贡献。他建议年青的共产党员要好好学习有关统战工作的文件。
