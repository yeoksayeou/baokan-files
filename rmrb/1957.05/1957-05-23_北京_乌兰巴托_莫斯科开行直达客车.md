    Direct Passenger Train Service Between Beijing, Ulaanbaatar, and Moscow
    According to the Beijing Daily News: Direct passenger train service between Beijing, Ulaanbaatar, and Moscow began on the 21st. The first passenger train departing from Moscow left on the 21st, and the first passenger train departing from Beijing will leave on June 1st; hereafter, there will be three round trips per week.
    This passenger train, connecting the capitals of China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, will travel a distance of 8,020 kilometers. Within China, it will pass through the newly built Fengsha (Fengtai to Shacheng) Railway and Ji’er (集宁 to 二连) Railway after liberation. It is more than 1,000 kilometers shorter than the route via Manzhouli in Northeast China to Moscow. However, because trains cannot run too fast on the newly built railway, it will temporarily take one day longer than the Beijing-Moscow direct train via Manzhouli.

    北京—乌兰巴托—莫斯科开行直达客车
    据北京日报讯　北京—乌兰巴托—莫斯科之间，21日起开行直通客车。从莫斯科出发的第一趟客车21日开出，从北京出发的第一趟客车将在6月1日开出；今后每星期要对开三次。
    这趟连接中国、蒙古、苏联三国首都的客车，要经过八千零二十公里的路程。在我国境内，它将通过解放后新建的丰沙（丰台到沙城）铁路和集二（集宁到二连）铁路。它比绕我国东北满洲里通往莫斯科的路线，缩短一千多公里。但是由于在新修起来的铁路上火车不能跑得太快，它暂时要比绕道满洲里的北京—莫斯科直达列车多走一天。
