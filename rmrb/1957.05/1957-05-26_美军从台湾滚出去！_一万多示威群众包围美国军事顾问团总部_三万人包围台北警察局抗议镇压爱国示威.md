Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Taipei dispatch from foreign news agencies: In yesterday's anti-American patriotic demonstration, Taipei citizens smashed the U.S. "Embassy" and the U.S. Information Service, surrounded the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group headquarters in Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taipei City Police Department, and chased and cursed U.S. military officers and soldiers who usually acted tyrannically in Taiwan. United Press International reporters said: This incident shows that "anti-American sentiment pervades the entire Taiwan." The Taiwan people's "long-dormant anti-American sentiment erupted as violently as gunpowder."

The anti-American patriotic demonstration of the Taiwan people on May 24 began with the siege of the U.S. "Embassy." At about 10:30 in the morning, only a few hundred demonstrators were gathered in front of the U.S. "Embassy," but by noon, the number of demonstrators had rapidly increased to more than five thousand, and in the afternoon to more than ten thousand. Angry crowds rushed into the U.S. Embassy, tore down and shredded the Stars and Stripes, and beat American personnel inside the embassy. Until 4:00 p.m., the U.S. Embassy was under the control of patriotic demonstrators.

Another large group of demonstrators rushed into the U.S. Information Service. The demonstrators tore up, smashed, or threw out of the windows many books, periodicals, records, and films from the U.S. Information Service, and destroyed other equipment.

At the same time, tens of thousands of angry people, shouting the slogan "U.S. troops get out," surrounded the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group headquarters in Taiwan (located in the Taiwan Sugar Corporation Building). Because the iron gates there were locked, the masses were unable to rush in. Ignoring the threat of machine guns set up by Chiang Kai-shek's police, the demonstrators damaged and burned six U.S. military vehicles in front of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation Building.

Demonstrators, including many students, rushed into the Taipei City Post and Telecommunications Bureau, seeking out seven American soldiers hiding inside. These American soldiers fled in disgrace under the protection of a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's police.

Another large group of demonstrators flocked to the airport, attempting to hunt down Reynolds, the U.S. military killer who murdered the Chinese Liu Ziran, but they did not find the U.S. military murderer.

Taipei residents were extremely dissatisfied with the Chiang Kai-shek group's dispatch of a large number of police to suppress the anti-American patriotic demonstrations. About 30,000 people surrounded the Taipei City Police Department for six hours, demanding the release of a group of students and citizens arrested for participating in the anti-American demonstrations. The police even opened fire, killing two students participating in the demonstration. The angry masses immediately seized the pistols of four policemen and at one point rushed into the police station. Later, a large number of Chiang's troops came to suppress the demonstration, and the demonstrators dispersed.

    美军从台湾滚出去！
    一万多示威群众包围美国军事顾问团总部
    三万人包围台北警察局抗议镇压爱国示威
    新华社25日讯　据外国通讯社台北消息：在昨天爆发的反美爱国大示威中，台北市民捣毁了美国“大使馆”和美国新闻处，包围了美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部和蒋介石集团台北市警察局，并且在马路上追逐和怒骂平日在台湾横行霸道的美军官兵。合众社记者说：这一事件表明“反美情绪遍及整个台湾”。台湾人民“长期潜在的反美情绪像火药那样猛烈地爆发出来”。
    5月24日的台湾人民反美爱国大示威从包围美国“大使馆”开始。在上午约十点半钟，美国“大使馆”门前还只是聚集了几百名示威群众，但到了中午时候，示威群众迅速增加到五千多人，下午增加到一万多人。愤怒的群众冲进这个美国大使馆，扯下并撕毁了星条旗，并且殴打了大使馆内的美国人员。一直到下午四时，美国大使馆都在示威爱国者的控制中。
    另一大群示威群众冲进了美国新闻处。示威者把美国新闻处的许多书刊、唱片、影片等都撕破，打碎，或者扔到窗外去，并且捣毁了其他设备。
    和这同时，成千上万愤怒的群众高呼着“美军滚出去”的口号，包围了美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部（设在台湾糖业公司大厦）。由于那里铁门深锁，群众没有能够冲进去。示威者不顾蒋介石警察架起机关枪的威胁，在台糖大厦门前毁坏和烧毁了六辆美国军用汽车。
    包括许多学生在内的示威群众，冲进了台北市邮电局，追寻七个躲在里面的美国兵。这些美国兵在大批蒋介石警察的保护下狼狈逃走了。
    另一大群示威群众蜂涌到飞机场去，企图追捕杀害中国人刘自然的美军凶手雷诺，但是没有找到这个美军杀人犯。
    台北市居民对蒋介石集团派遣大批警察镇压反美爱国示威，极为不满。约三万人包围了台北市警察局达六个钟头之久，要求释放因参加反美示威被捕的一批学生和市民。警察竟开枪打死了两名参加示威的学生，愤怒的群众随即夺取了四名警察的手枪，并且一度冲进警察局去。后来大批蒋军开来镇压，示威群众才散去。
