Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th - Taiwan newspapers report: The Chiang Kai-shek clique announced on the 29th that all gatherings, parades, demonstrations, petitions, strikes, class boycotts, market boycotts, and work stoppages are prohibited throughout Taiwan Island. In the past six days, all counties and cities in Taiwan have successively announced martial law. During curfew and martial law hours, the lighting of firecrackers is prohibited.

The three divisions of Chiang's troops that entered Taipei City were still stationed in the urban and suburban areas of Taipei on the 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th - The Associated Press says that although Taipei City is outwardly calm, Americans still feel uneasy. Many fear that only the strict defense of the Kuomintang army has prevented new anti-American demonstrations from occurring. Now, Americans dare not drive their cars out because they are afraid that if an incident occurs with a Chinese person, an angry mob will appear.

    台湾全岛戒严，爆竹也禁止放
    美国人心神不安不敢外出
    新华社香港30日电　据台湾报纸报道：蒋介石集团29日宣布，台湾全岛禁止一切集会、游行、示威、请愿、罢工、罢课、罢市和罢业。在过去六日间，台湾全岛各县市都先后宣布戒严。在宵禁和戒严的时间内，禁止燃放爆竹。
    开入台北市的三师蒋军，29日还分别驻守在台北市区和市郊。
    据新华社28日讯　美联社说，目前台北市尽管表面上平静，可是美国人仍然感到不安，许多人担心，只是由于国民党军队的严密守卫，才防止了新的反美示威行动发生。现在美国人不敢开汽车出去，因为害怕他们同一个中国人发生事件，就会有一群愤怒的群众出现。
