    I.
    The Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Academic Divisions Committee is now open.
    It has been nearly two years since the establishment of the academic divisions in June 1955. Why is it that the academic divisions committee meetings, which are supposed to be held twice a year, are only being held for the second time today?
    This is because, since December 1955, the academic members and other scientific workers have participated in the formulation of the Twelve-Year Development Plan for Science, which took more than half a year. Then, in the second half of 1956, a considerable amount of time was spent on the 1956 annual Natural Science Awards.
    In 1956, the academic members and the majority of scientific workers effectively replaced the plenary meetings with these two collective tasks. Therefore, with the request of most members and with the approval of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Executive Council, the two academic divisions committee meetings for 1956 were suspended.
    We are holding the Second Plenary Session of the Academic Divisions Committee today, precisely at a major historical period. A high tide of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" has been set off throughout the country, and our leading party, the Chinese Communist Party, has also begun a rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism.
    Holding a meeting at such a time means that our meeting must reflect the spirit of the current era. We must fully implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" at this meeting, launch criticism and self-criticism of the scientific undertakings we are jointly engaged in, and put forward constructive and specific suggestions in order to improve our work.
    II.
    Over the past two years, the academic divisions have done relatively important work facing the whole country. As mentioned above, in addition to participating in the formulation of the long-term plan, the academic divisions also conducted the Natural Science Awards last year. Although this work inevitably had many shortcomings due to its being the first attempt, it has attracted the attention of the people throughout the country and internationally.
    The award-winning natural science works are all research results from the past seven years and have a certain level of height.
    The thirty-four award-winning natural science works are all research results of Chinese scientists in the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and they all have a certain level of height in various disciplines. Of course, this is not the entirety of the excellent achievements. There are many other excellent achievements that were not recommended in time and therefore could not be selected. We will gradually commend them in the future. If we are to consider the achievements in all aspects of the construction undertaking in the seven years since the founding of the country, we should acknowledge that the scientists and technicians of the country have made tremendous efforts.
    In the science awards, we postponed the selection of philosophy and social science works. This is not out of a "valuing science over arts" viewpoint, but rather that the selection of philosophy and social science works is more difficult, making it necessary for us to adopt a more cautious attitude. There is no doubt that the achievements in this area are by no means inferior to those in natural science and technology science. Just consider this unprecedented phenomenon. Since liberation, a nationwide upsurge of voluntary learning of Marxism-Leninism has swept through the scientific and cultural circles, and Marxism-Leninism has established a solid leading position in academic thought. This work achievement on a national scale is obvious to all. Therefore, it is obvious that our postponement of the selection of philosophy and social science works is not due to a lack of excellent works or any kind of bias.
    The awards work has only been carried out for the first time and will continue in the future. We hope to gain experience in our work so that our working methods can be gradually improved and shortcomings can be gradually reduced.
    III.
    With the progress of the national construction undertaking, the Party and the government put forward the call of "marching towards science" last year, greatly encouraging the research enthusiasm of the academic and cultural circles throughout the country. We believe this is worth celebrating.
    In recent years, colleges and universities across the country have concentrated their efforts on cultivating a large number of construction talents for the country, but they still have a huge potential for scientific research. Scientific research work should be gradually carried out in colleges and universities. This is equivalent to investing a large number of fresh troops on the science front, and the scientific research camp will be further expanded in the future.
    In coordination with the needs of various production and construction projects, industrial departments across the country have gradually established scientific and technological research institutions. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has been officially established, and a unified professional academy of medical sciences is also being formed. In this way, it will be possible to more directly solve the current problems encountered in practical production and national life, and it will also be convenient to accumulate experience and gradually enrich and improve scientific research.
    Fellow members, as you know, generally speaking, there are two directions for scientific research. One is to break through to a higher level, and the other is to spread out on a plane. Spreading out on a plane means applying known scientific theories to practical production and practical life. This requires a large number of scientists and technicians of various levels to carry out large-scale work. Breaking through to a higher level means raising scientific theories to a higher level based on practical experience, that is, opening up scientific positions in unknown fields. The scientists and technicians required for this need to be of high quality, but the quantity does not need to be so large.
    Although these two research directions are vertical and horizontal, they are complementary. The relationship between the two is sometimes impossible to clearly separate. Chairman Mao Zedong once gave such instructions for literary and artistic activities: improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement. This policy also applies well to scientific research activities. That is to say, theory must be linked to practice, and the progress of practice in turn requires the improvement of theory. This repeats endlessly, so that the development of science and society never ends.
    The state attaches importance to the development of scientific undertakings in building socialism. But how can science develop smoothly? In the implementation of tasks, there must be an appropriate division of labor and close cooperation; and in the use of forces, there must be appropriate dispersion and necessary concentration. It is very gratifying that the Science Planning Commission of the State Council has become a permanent body after leading scientists across the country to formulate a draft of a long-term plan for scientific development. It is the national science undertaking's policy and organizational leadership organ, responsible for summarizing and balancing the scientific research plans of various departments and performing high-level coordination tasks. With such an institution in scientific administration to implement the policy of "overall planning and appropriate arrangement," there is no doubt that many difficulties and obstacles in scientific development can be reduced. Soon, the Science Planning Commission of the State Council will convene a meeting to discuss the issue of the scientific research system, that is, how to better carry out the division of labor and cooperation, and decentralization and concentration. With the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the joint efforts of scientists, we believe that this issue will be properly resolved.
    A party that can lead the formulation of a long-term plan for science will surely be able to lead us to realize the long-term plan.
    Fellow members, the Party is capable of leading science. Facts tell us that without the leadership of the Party, it would not have been possible to formulate a long-term plan for the development of science. We believe that the Party that was able to lead us in formulating the long-term plan will certainly be able to lead us to obtain good coordination and jointly realize the long-term plan. Facts also tell us that the Party's leadership in scientific administration is carried out through the close cooperation of scientists. Regarding leadership in academic matters, the Party will rely even more on scientists, allowing them to lead the advancement of scientific research work themselves. Today, the Party and the government have reduced a large amount of scientific administrative work from our scientists, which facilitates us to concentrate our efforts to do a better job in academic leadership work and scientific research work. Therefore, we have an obligation to especially respect the high-level coordination work of the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, and we should work together to make this work progress smoothly.
    IV.
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the national academic leadership center, and it itself is engaged in major scientific research. Its task is very arduous. Its own research tasks must adopt the policy of "focusing on development and giving corresponding consideration," and it must face the whole country and benefit the world. It must concentrate a certain amount of force to carry out basic theoretical research, absorb the world's latest technical sciences, and undertake relatively long-term comprehensive scientific tasks; it must also constantly pay attention to ideological work, understand the academic trends of the world and the country, and guide and determine the direction of academic development. The implementation of these tasks depends on the joint efforts of all academic members and, even more so, on the collective support of scientists across the country. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of the academic divisions and uniting the scientific forces of the country is our unshirkable responsibility.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the academic divisions, we will elect a number of additional academic members during this conference to strengthen the strength of the academic divisions. As for how to give play to the role of the academic divisions and academic members, based on the initial experience of the past two years, the academy and various academic divisions have put forward some specific methods in their work reports. We earnestly hope that all members and comrades will carefully review them so that we can have a set of practical methods that can be affirmed as the basis for future work.
    In order to unite the scientific forces of the country, we believe that promoting scientific democracy and carrying out the contention of a hundred schools of thought is the best way. Due to lack of experience and shortcomings in work, it is undeniable that there are some estrangements between the Academy of Sciences and fraternal departments outside the academy, and the various relationships within the academy have not reached good coordination. Here, we need to do a lot of careful work. Not long ago, the Academy of Sciences convened a three-day symposium to discuss how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, exposing many contradictions and accepting many suggestions. At this meeting, we have also decided to launch an academic forum, hoping that all members and comrades will, in accordance with the principle of "knowing everything and saying everything," make as much criticism and comments as possible on the national scientific administrative and scientific research work, especially the work related to the Academy of Sciences.
    Any thing, in progress, is certainly contradictory, and the existence and struggle of contradictions is precisely the internal factor promoting the progress of things. The existence of contradiction is a normal phenomenon. But if the contradiction is concealed or the mutual generation and restraint of the contradiction is hindered, that is an abnormal man-made phenomenon. That can only make the contradiction more and more expanded, and hinder the progress of things, and even lead to destruction. Therefore, we should boldly expose contradictions; and promote the abandonment or transformation of contradictions.
    Implementing the contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic matters is the original driving force for promoting academic development.
    The political contention of a hundred schools of thought was originally highly valued in ancient China. The so-called "Shun had a flag for reporting good deeds, and Yu erected a drum for daring to advise," or dispatched historians from time to time to go deep into the folk to collect folk songs and listen to the sufferings of the people, although these may not necessarily be true historical facts, ancient thinkers praised them as an ideal system for improving politics. Today, in our scientific administrative field, we believe that we should also establish a system for constantly exposing internal contradictions, constantly exposing contradictions and resolving contradictions, in order to facilitate the development of scientific undertakings and national construction undertakings.
    We have the responsibility to lead academic research and engage in academic research, so we have even more responsibility to implement the contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic matters. The contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic matters is the competition in research practice and the debate on different opinions in academic matters. This is the inherent meaning of the "contention of a hundred schools of thought," and in practice it is the original driving force for promoting academic development.
    Competition in research practice is a stimulus to research desires. Speaking with work achievements can encourage and learn from each other among scientific workers in the same or different fields, and can better give play to independent thinking and engage in creative activities, and produce excellent results better and faster.
    Especially in academic debates on different opinions, it is a process of unity of opposites. After the struggle of contradictions, the opposing sides influence each other and learn from each other. Even if different opinions cannot be unified for a while, they are approaching unification step by step. This process is constantly developing. Old contradictions are unified, and new contradictions are generated at a higher stage, so that things develop and advance continuously and dialectically. This process was more clearly recognized by our ancient thinkers. For example, Zhuangzi's so-called "while being born, it dies, while dying, it is born; while being possible, it is impossible, while being impossible, it is possible" is the formalization of this process. But our position is different from Zhuangzi's. Zhuangzi sees the contradictions and oppositions of things and obliterates right and wrong, while we grasp the opposition of contradictions at any time and distinguish right and wrong, that is, we grasp the correct right and wrong at any time with the development of the opposition between right and wrong.
    From this, we can see that the policy of contending a hundred schools of thought is a long-term policy for developing academic and all other construction undertakings. The unity of contradictory opposition is eternally present in development, so the policy of contending a hundred schools of thought must be eternally strived to implement.
    At this conference, we also focus on the contention of a hundred schools of thought in academic matters, that is, reading scientific papers. We have received a total of seventy-eight academic papers, including thirty-five in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, sixteen in biology, thirteen in earth sciences, six in technical sciences, and eight in philosophy and social sciences, which will be read separately at the meetings of the academic divisions. We hope that all members and comrades will try their best to conduct free discussions.
    It has long been criticized that the academic atmosphere in our China is not strong. How to make the academic atmosphere in China stronger, freely carry out academic debates, give different schools of thought the freedom to research and the freedom to speak, and make them bloom more luxuriantly, we believe that this is a central issue that the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the academic divisions, the research institutions of various departments, the academic societies, and all scientific and cultural workers should pay special attention to.
    V.
    Fellow members, fellow comrades, the development of modern science in China was previously restricted in various ways and was relatively backward. We have few people, and even fewer senior scientists, but the tasks are very heavy. However, in the years since liberation, our scientific undertakings, like other national construction undertakings, have made rapid progress. In addition to the dedicated efforts of our own scientists and technicians, this is mainly due to the assistance of scientists from our great ally, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries. For example, in the research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet Union is helping us build a heavy water reactor with a power of 7,000 kilowatts and a cyclotron that can produce α particles with 25 million electron volts, which will be completed within the year. For example, in the formulation of the long-term plan for the development of science, the Soviet Academy of Sciences specially sent more than a dozen outstanding scientists to assist, and a considerable number of Soviet experts and experts from other fraternal countries in China also participated in this work. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to the scientists and governments of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries on behalf of everyone.
    To catch up with international standards, it is necessary to link with the actual conditions of the country, learn from the advanced experience of all countries, and strengthen international cooperation.
    To develop Chinese science and enable Chinese science to catch up with international advanced levels in a not too long period of time, there is no doubt that we must continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. The excellent scientific achievements of any country outside the socialist camp should also become the object of our study. From the history of the development of Chinese culture, the strength of our nation lies in being good at learning the culture of other nations, absorbing the cultural achievements of other nations, enriching the cultural content of our nation, and making the cultural development of our nation a continuous grand stream. Today, we should especially carry forward this fine tradition, link with the actual conditions of our country, learn from the advanced experience of all countries, and strengthen international cooperation.
    Regarding international cooperation in academic matters, there has been a certain development in the past two years. The academy's general report describes the situation in more detail. Here, we earnestly hope that the academic divisions and all academic members should pay special attention to this work. For example, friendly exchanges between scientists from various countries, mutual participation in various academic conferences, the dispatch of students to study abroad, the exchange of professors, and the exchange of scientific research data and achievements all require us to carry out them in a more planned way. Such a plan can only be formulated by experts in various disciplines.
    Our "Constitution" solemnly stipulates in its preamble:
      "In international affairs, our country's steadfast policy is to strive for the noble goal of world peace and human progress."
    Based on this, we can know that through international cooperation in academic matters, we also have the responsibility to unite scientists from all over the world and make unremitting efforts to defend peace, defend humanity, and defend science. This is not only the responsibility of Chinese citizens, but also the common responsibility of all scientists in all countries of the world.
    VI.
    The basic tasks of the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions
    Fellow comrades, my opening remarks have been too long. In general, I would like to clarify the basic tasks of the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions. The main points are no more than these four:
    First: Facing the whole country, strengthen academic leadership;
    Second: Promote democracy, implement the contention of a hundred schools of thought;
    Third: Strengthen coordination, unite scientific forces;
    Fourth: Learn from advanced experience, strengthen international cooperation.
    According to my understanding, these tasks are roughly the expectations of scientists across the country and all units related to scientific undertakings for the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions. Whether the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions can shoulder such important tasks, or how can they be able to shoulder them, is probably a question of common concern to all members and comrades. But these questions cannot be solved by the Academy of Sciences, the academic divisions, or the academic members alone. They must be gradually solved under the correct leadership of the Party and the government and with the strong support of all scientists and the people of the country.
    In short, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the academy of sciences of Chinese scientists and the academy of sciences of the Chinese people. The achievements of the Academy of Sciences in recent years have not been good enough, and the previous four points have not been done well enough. There are even many deviations and problems. We earnestly request that all scientists and the people of the country constantly give us encouragement so that our future work can be done better and fewer mistakes can be made. If mistakes are made, they can be corrected immediately.
    Today's meeting is attended and guided by leading comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, the State Council, and other administrative departments, and is attended by responsible comrades of various colleges and universities, research institutions of various industrial departments, and academic societies, as well as expert consultants from fraternal countries. Here, on behalf of everyone, I would like to express our warm welcome and respect to them.

    中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议开幕词
    郭沫若
    一
    中国科学院学部委员会第二次全体会议，现在开幕了。
    自1955年6月学部成立以来已经将近两年，照规定每年应该开会两次的学部委员会会议为什么到今天才开第二次会议呢？
    这是因为自1955年12月起各学部委员和其他科学工作者参加了十二年发展科学远景规划的制订，费了半年以上的时间；接着在1956年的下半年，又费了相当长的时间从事1956年度自然科学的评奖工作。
    1956年各学部委员和多数科学工作者就是以这两项集体工作在实际上代替了全体会议。因此，1956年度的两次学部委员会会议是在大多数委员们的要求，并经过中国科学院院务会议的同意之下，停止召开的。
    我们在今天来举行第二次学部委员全体会议，恰好是在一个重大的历史时期。在全国范围内已经掀起了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的高潮，我们的领导党，中国共产党，也开始了反对官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的整风运动。
    在这样的时期召开会议，我们的会议因此也就不能不体现着当前的时代精神。我们要使这次会议充分贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对于我们所共同从事的科学事业，展开批评和自我批评，提出建设性的具体建议，以便改进我们的工作。
    二
    两年来，学部是做出了比较重要的面向全国的工作的。如上所述，除了参加远景规划的制订以外，各学部在去年又进行了自然科学论著的评奖。这一工作由于事属草创、虽然不免有不少缺点，但已引起了全国人民的重视和国际的注意。
    获奖的自然科学论著，都是七年来的研究成果，都具有一定高度的水平。
    获奖的三十四项自然科学论著，都是中华人民共和国成立以来七年间中国科学家们的研究成果，在各门学科中都具有着一定高度的水平。当然，这还不是优秀成果的全部，此外来不及推荐因而未能评选的优秀成果还很多，我们在今后要逐步地加以表扬。如果我们要考虑到建国七年来建设事业各方面的成就，我们应该承认全国科学家和技术家们是作了巨大的努力的。
    在科学评奖中我们把哲学社会科学方面的评选推迟了。这并不是出于“重理轻文”的观点，而是哲学社会科学方面的评选更加困难，使我们不能不采取更加慎重的态度。毫无疑问，在这方面的成就是决不亚于自然科学和技术科学的成就的。单请考虑到这样一个空前未有的现象吧。解放以来，科学文化界普遍地卷起了对于马克思列宁主义自愿学习的高潮，马克思列宁主义在学术思想中已经取得了坚固的领导地位。在全国范围内的这一工作成绩是有目共睹的。因此，我们把关于哲学社会科学的评选推迟，并不是由于优秀论著的缺乏，或有所畸轻畸重，是显而易见的事。
    评奖工作才仅仅进行了第一次，今后还将继续进行。我们希望在工作中取得经验，能够使工作方法逐渐改进，缺点可以逐渐减少。
    三
    随着国家建设事业的进展，党和政府在去年提出了“向科学进军”的号召，大大地鼓舞了全国学术文化界的研究热情。我们认为这是值得庆贺的。
    全国高等院校几年来集中力量为国家培养出了大量的建设人才，但依然有巨大的潜在的科学研究力量，在高等院校中应逐步展开科学研究工作。这等于是向科学战线上投入大量的生力军，科学研究的阵营今后要更加扩大了。
    全国产业部门配合着各项生产建设的需要，已逐步建立了科学技术研究机构。中国农业科学院已正式成立，医学方面的统一的专业科学院也正在形成中。这样，便能更直接地解决生产实际和国民生活中所遭遇到的当前问题，而又便于积累经验，使科学研究逐步得到充实和提高。
    各位委员，你们是知道的。科学研究的方向，大体说来，有这样的两种。一种是向高层突破，另一种是向平面铺开。向平面铺开是说把既知的科学理论应用于生产实际和生活实际。这需要有大量的各项各级的科学家和技术家来进行大规模的工作。向高层突破，是根据实践的经验把科学理论提到更高的水平，也就是说向未知的领域中开拓出科学阵地。这所需要的科学家和技术家，质量要求其高，而数量则可不必那么大。
    这两种研究方向，虽然一纵一横，但却是相辅相成。两者的关系有时更是不可能划然分开的。毛泽东主席对于文艺活动曾经作过这样的指示：在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。这个方针也正好适用于科学研究活动。这就是说，理论必须联系实际，而实际的进展反过来又要求理论的提高。这样返复着没有止境，也就使科学和社会的发展永远没有止境。
    国家在建设社会主义事业上是重视科学事业的发展的。但如何才能使科学顺畅地发展？在任务的执行上，必须有适当的分工和密切的合作；而在力量的使用上，也必须有适当的分散和必要的集中。很可庆幸的，是国务院科学规划委员会，在领导着全国科学家制定了科学发展远景规划草案之后，已经成为常设的机构。它是全国科学事业的方针政策和组织领导的机关，担负着汇总平衡各部门的科学研究计划和高级协调的任务。在科学行政上有了这样一个机构来执行“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针，毫无疑问，在科学发展上是可以减少许多困难和阻碍的。不久，国务院科学规划委员会将召集会议来讨论有关科学研究的体制问题，也就是如何更好地进行分工合作和分散集中的问题。靠着党和政府的正确领导和科学家们的共同努力，关于这一问题，我们相信，一定会得到妥善的解决。
    能够领导制订科学远景规划的党，一定能够领导我们实现远景规划
    各位委员，党是能够领导科学的。事实告诉我们，发展科学的远景规划，如果没有党的领导，便不可能制订。能够领导我们制订了远景规划的党，我们相信，一定能够领导我们获得很好的协调，共同实现远景规划。事实也告诉我们，党在科学行政方面的领导是通过科学家们的通力合作来进行的，关于学术方面的领导，党将更要依靠科学家，让科学家们自己领导着科学研究工作的前进。今天党和政府把大量的科学行政工作从我们科学家身上减轻了，这就便利于我们更能集中力量来做好学术领导工作和科学研究工作。因此，我们有义务特别尊重国务院科学规划委员会的高级协调工作，我们应该通力合作地使这一工作获得顺畅的进展。
    四
    中国科学院是全国学术领导的中心，而它本身又从事着重大的科学研究。它的任务是很艰巨的。它本身的研究任务必须采取“重点发展，相应照顾”的方针，而又必须面向全国、兼善天下。它必须集中一定的力量来进行基础理论的研究，吸收世界最新的技术科学，担负比较长期的综合性的科学任务；它也必须经常注意到思想工作，了解全世界的和全国的学术动态，指导和确定学术发展的方向。这些任务的执行有赖于全体学部委员的共同努力，更有赖于全国科学家的集体支持，因而加强学部领导、团结全国科学力量也就是我们义不容辞的责任。
    为了加强学部的领导，在这次大会期间我们要增选若干学部委员使学部力量加强。至于如何发挥学部和学部委员的作用，根据两年来的初步经验，院和各学部在工作报告中提出了一些具体的办法，我们恳切地希望各位委员、各位同志仔细地加以审议，使我们能够有一套切实可行的方法被肯定下来，作为今后工作的依据。
    为了团结全国科学力量，我们认为发扬科学民主、开展百家争鸣是最好的办法。由于缺乏经验和工作上的缺点，不可否认科学院和院外兄弟部门之间的关系是有些隔阂的，院内的各种关系也并没有达到很好的协调。在这里需要我们做很多仔细的工作。在不久以前，科学院曾经召开过三天座谈会，讨论如何正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题，揭发了不少的矛盾，也接受了不少的建议。在这次会议上，我们更决定开展学术论坛，希望各位委员和各位同志对于全国的科学行政和科学研究工作，特别是有关科学院的工作，本“知无不言、言无不尽”的原则，尽量地提出批评和意见。
    任何事物，在进展中肯定是有矛盾的，矛盾的存在和斗争正是促进事物进展的内在因素。矛盾的存在是正常的现象。但如果把矛盾掩蔽起来或者阻碍着矛盾的相生相克，那倒是不正常的人为现象。那只有使矛盾愈见扩大，而阻碍着事物的进展，甚而导至毁灭。因此，我们应该大胆地揭发矛盾；并促进矛盾的扬弃或者蜕变。
    贯彻学术性的百家争鸣，是促进学术发展的原动力
    政治性的百家争鸣，在中国古代本来是很重视的。所谓“舜有告善之旌，禹立敢谏之鼓”，或者按时派遣史官深入民间采集歌谣，听取民间疾苦，这些虽然不一定就是真正的史实，但古代思想家是作为改进政治的理想制度而加以歌颂的。在今天，就在我们科学行政领域内，我们认为也应该建立经常揭露内部矛盾的制度，不断地揭发矛盾、解决矛盾，以利于科学事业和国家建设事业的发展。
    我们负有责任领导学术研究并从事学术研究，因而我们更有责任贯彻学术性的百家争鸣。学术性的百家争鸣便是在研究实践中的竞赛和在学术上不同意见的论辩。这本是“百家争鸣”的固有的意义，而在实际上正是促进学术发展的原动力。
    研究实践中的竞赛是研究欲望的刺激。凭工作成绩说话，可以使同行或不同行的科学工作者在相互间受到鼓舞，得到观摩，能更多地发挥独立思考、从事创造性的活动，更好更快地产生出优秀的成果。
    特别是在学术上不同意见的论辩，正是矛盾统一的过程。经过矛盾的斗争，对立双方相互影响、相互切磋，即使不同意见一时不能得到统一，而却是一步一步向统一接近。这种过程是经常发展着的。旧的矛盾统一了，在更高的阶段上又有新的矛盾产生，如此不断地辩证地使事物发展前进。这种过程，在我们古代的思想家是比较有明白的认识的，比如庄子所说的“方生方死，方死方生；方可方不可，方不可方可”，正是这种过程的定式化。但我们的立场和庄子不同。庄子是看到事物的矛盾对立而泯却是非，我们是随时掌握着矛盾的对立而明辨是非，也就是说随着是非对立的发展随时抓着正确的是非。
    由此我们可以看到百家争鸣的政策，正是发展学术和其它一切建设事业的长期政策。矛盾对立的同一在发展中是永恒存在，因而百家争鸣的政策也就要永恒地努力贯彻。
    在这次大会上，我们也侧重于学术性的百家争鸣，那就是宣读科学论文。我们一共收到了学术论文七十八篇，其中属于数理化方面的三十五篇，生物学方面的十六篇，地学方面的十三篇，技术科学方面的六篇，哲学社会科学方面的八篇，将分别在各学部的会议上宣读，我们希望各位委员、各位同志尽量地展开自由讨论。
    早就有人批评过，在我们中国学术空气不浓厚。怎样使中国学术空气更加浓厚起来，自由地开展学术辩论，使不同学派都有研究的自由和发言的自由，都开出更繁盛的花朵，我们认为这是中国科学院、各学部、各部门的研究机构、各学会、一切科学文化工作者所应该特别加以重视的一个中心问题。
    五
    各位委员，各位同志，中国近代科学的发展，以前受着种种的限制，是比较落后的。我们的人手少，高级的科学家更少，而任务却十分繁重。但自解放以来的几年间，我们的科学事业和其他国家建设事业一样，却得到了迅速的进展，这在本国科学家和技术家的献身努力之外，主要是获得了我们伟大的盟邦苏联和其他兄弟国家的科学家们的帮助。例如，在和平利用原子能的研究方面，苏联帮助我们建立着功率七千瓩的重水型原子反应堆，能产生二千五百万电子伏的α粒子的回旋加速器，在年内就要建成了。又例如发展科学的远景规划的制订，苏联科学院曾经专门派遣了十几位优秀的科学家前来协助，还有在华的苏联专家和其他兄弟国家的专家为数不少的人参加了这一工作。请允许我借这个机会代表着大家向苏联和其他兄弟国家的科学家和政府表示我们衷心的感谢。
    要赶上国际水平，必须联系本国实际，学习一切国家的先进经验，加强国际合作
    要发展中国科学，要使中国科学在不太长的时期内能够赶上国际先进水平，毫无疑问，我们还必须继续努力学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验。社会主义阵营以外的任何国家的优秀的科学成果也都应该成为我们学习的对象。从中国文化的发展史上看来，我们民族的长处就是在善于学习别的民族的文化，把别的民族的文化成果吸收过来，丰富本民族的文化内容，使本民族的文化发展成为不断的宏流。在今天我们应该特别发扬这种优良的传统，联系着本国的实际，学习一切国家的先进经验，加强国际合作。
    关于学术上的国际合作，近两年来有了一定的发展，在院的总报告中叙述了比较详细的情况。在这里我们恳切地希望：各学部和各位学部委员对于这项工作应该予以特别的关心。例如各国科学家的友好往来，各种学术性会议的相互参加，留学生的派遣，教授的交聘，科学研究资料和成果等的交换，都需要我们更有计划地进行。这样的计划是要各项学科的专家们才能制定的。
    我们的“宪法”在序言里庄严地规定着：
      “在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”
    据此可以知道，通过学术上的国际合作，我们还有责任：团结世界各国的科学家，为保卫和平，保卫人类，保卫科学而作不懈的奋斗。这不仅是中国公民的责任，也是世界各国一切科学家的共同责任。

    科学院和各学部的基本任务
    各位同志，我的开场白已经说得太多了。总起来说，我是想把科学院和各学部的基本任务明确一下，要点不外是这样四条：
    第一：面向全国，加强学术领导；
    第二：发扬民主，贯彻百家争鸣；
    第三：加强协调，团结科学力量；
    第四：学习先进，加强国际合作。
    据我的体会，这些任务大体上是全国科学家和一切与科学事业有关的各单位对于科学院和各学部的期待。科学院和各学部是否能够担负得起这样重大的任务，或者要怎样才能够使它们担负得起，这恐怕也是各位委员、各位同志所共同关心的问题。但这些问题单靠科学院、学部、学部委员是不能够解决的，一定要在党和政府的正确领导下，在全体科学家、全国人民的大力支持下，才能够逐步得到解决。
    总之，中国科学院是中国科学家的科学院，是中国人民的科学院。几年来科学院的成绩不够好，前面的四条就做得很不够，甚至还有不少的偏差和毛病，我们恳切地请求全体科学家和全国人民不断地给我们以鞭策，使我们今后的工作能够做得好一些，错误能够犯得少一些。犯了错误也能够立即得到纠正。
    今天的会有中国共产党和各民主党派、国务院和其他行政部门的领导同志出席指导，有各高等院校、各产业部门研究机构、各学会的负责同志和兄弟国家的专家顾问们参加，我在这里代表着大家向他们表示热诚的欢迎和敬意。
