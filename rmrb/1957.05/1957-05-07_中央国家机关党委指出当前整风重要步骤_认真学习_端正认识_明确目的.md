Central State Organs Party Committee Points Out Important Steps in Current Rectification: Conscientiously Study, Correct Understanding, Clarify Purpose

(Reported by this newspaper) The Central State Organs Party Committee held a standing committee meeting on the 6th to discuss the rectification plan for the central state organs and studied several important issues raised in the initial stages of rectification in various departments.

After the Central Committee issued the directive on carrying out the rectification movement, more than sixty units of the central state organs have held multiple joint meetings of the Party Group and Party Committee, and most have initially formulated rectification movement plans. Based on the situation in most units, the standing committee members believed that the rectification movement should generally be divided into three stages: study, inspection, and summary. Of course, the division of stages should not be mechanical; the study stage should simultaneously discover problems and expose contradictions, and the inspection stage cannot do without studying documents. Many standing committee members, based on the previous stage of study in some departments and the Party Group discussions in the past two days, emphasized that documents should first be studied well to understand the spirit, use it as a weapon, and dispel concerns. However, some Party Groups did not pay enough attention to studying documents when discussing the rectification plan. Some people even said that the spirit in the documents is always the same, and since they have already studied for a period of time, they can now start checking work and solving problems, without the need to study the documents again. Many standing committee members believed this was a problem worth noting.

Many leading cadres and general cadres still have many concerns due to a lack of clear understanding of the purpose and methods of the rectification movement. Some cadres at the director-general level and above have passive and defensive emotions upon hearing about rectification, fearing that there will be many opinions after mobilizing the masses and that they will not be able to step down. General cadres have even more concerns, saying that major policies are determined by the leaders of the ministries, but they wonder if the rectification can target leading cadres, or will it only shake the leaves and not the roots. They express a lack of confidence in whether certain senior cadres can earnestly examine themselves and change their style in this rectification. Some comrades also feel that the leading comrades lack a humble and open-minded democratic spirit, fearing that making suggestions will be detrimental to them. Regarding the principle of being both serious and earnest and gentle and mild, some Party Groups also encountered many unclear or even incorrect views in the discussion. Some people always feel that since it is a movement, it cannot be gentle and mild, and that gentle and mild will lead to a harmonious atmosphere and a blurring of right and wrong. When checking and exposing problems, should everyone be greatly unleashed to put all the problems on the table? Some comrades also have concerns, feeling that it is easy to let go but difficult to take back, fearing that too many opinions will be raised and become unmanageable later. Therefore, many departments believe that conscientiously studying the documents and understanding the spirit of the documents to dispel concerns and correct understanding is an important step to ensure the smooth development of the rectification movement.

Regarding how to discover the main contradictions of each unit, based on the current situation of each unit, there can be different approaches. Some ministries and commissions have studied well in the previous stage, and the leadership has already studied the current main contradictions, or the contradictions have been exposed more sharply and obviously. These units have determined the main content of the rectification in the rectification plan. Units that have done this include the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Commerce. Some units did not conduct in-depth analysis of the current situation of their departments in the previous stage of study, and they do not have a good understanding of the current main contradictions. It is difficult to determine the main content of the rectification in the formulation of the plan. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Light Industry and other units have adopted the method of: studying while holding various forums and professional meetings in a planned manner to listen to opinions from all parties, in order to find out the main contradictions and enable leaders to have a clear understanding as soon as possible. The Standing Committee felt that this approach was better.

The Standing Committee discussed the issue of not delaying both rectification and work. Everyone believed that to ensure that neither is delayed, the most important thing is to make reasonable arrangements for the work during the rectification period, to focus on the main tasks, and to set aside some secondary tasks. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that rectification only solves key ideological and work style issues, and the rectification and work cannot be completely regarded as the same thing. The practice of trying to solve many specific problems in the work during the rectification will lose the significance of the rectification and prevent the rectification from becoming a Marxist ideological movement.

The Standing Committee discussed the leadership of the rectification, believing that the rectification must be led by the Party Groups of the various ministries and commissions, and the responsible comrades of the Party Groups should be personally responsible, and the leadership responsibility cannot be handed over to the second or third in command. However, to this day, responsible comrades of the Party Groups of one or two units are still unwilling to assume leadership responsibility. The Standing Committee will clearly put forward this issue in the rectification plan.

### 中央国家机关党委指出当前整风重要步骤  认真学习　端正认识　明确目的

    中央国家机关党委指出当前整风重要步骤
    认真学习　端正认识　明确目的
    本报讯　中央国家机关党委6日举行常委会议，讨论中央国家机关的整风规划，对各部门开始整风中所提出的几个重要问题作了研究。
    中央关于开展整风运动的指示发出后，中央国家机关的六十多个单位都已召开了多次党组党委联席会议，大多已经初步制定了整风运动规划。根据大多数单位的情况，常委委员们认为，整风运动一般应分为学习、检查、总结三个阶段。当然，划分阶段不应机械，学习阶段同时就要发现问题揭露矛盾，在检查阶段也不能不学习文件。不少常委委员根据一些部门前一阶段的学习和这两天党组讨论的情况，强调应该首先很好地学习文件，领会精神，作为武器，解除顾虑。可是，有些党组在讨论整风规划的时候，却对学习文件不够重视。有些人甚至说文件中的精神反正就是那些，既然已经学了一段时间，现在就可以着手检查工作解决问题，而不必再学文件。很多常委委员认为这是一个值得注意的问题。
    不少领导干部和一般干部由于对整风运动的目的以及作法认识不够明确，顾虑还是很多的。有些司局长以上的干部，一听说整风，就有被动挨整的消极情绪，害怕发动群众后意见很多，下不了台；一般干部的顾虑更多，他们说大政方针问题都是部的领导方面定的，可是整风能不能整到领导干部，会不会只摇树叶不动树根，对某些高级干部在这次整风中是否能认真检讨自己改变作风，表示没有信心。还有一些同志觉得领导同志还缺乏虚怀若谷从善如流的民主精神，害怕提了意见后会对自己不利。对于既严肃认真又和风细雨的方针，有些党组在讨论中也遇到不少不明确的以至错误的看法。有些人总觉得既搞运动就不能和风细雨，觉得和风细雨就会一团和气、是非不分。在检查和揭发问题的时候，要不要大大放手，让大家把一切问题都摆出来？有些同志也有顾虑，觉得放时容易收时难，怕意见提多了以后不可收拾。因此，许多部门都认为认真地学习文件领会文件精神，以解除顾虑、端正认识，是保证整风运动顺利展开的一个重要步骤。
    怎样发现各单位的主要矛盾，就各单位目前的情况看，可以有不同的作法。有些部、委前一阶段学习得较好，领导方面已经对当前的主要矛盾作了研究，或者是矛盾已经暴露得比较尖锐明显，这些单位，在整风规划中已经确定了整风的主要内容。这样做的单位有国家计划委员会、教育部、商业部等。有些单位在前一阶段学习中对于本部门当前情况没有进行深入的分析，对当前的主要矛盾还不够摸底。在制定规划中就确定整风主要内容是有困难的。中国科学院、轻工业部等单位采取的办法是：一边学习，一边有计划地召开各种座谈会、专业会议，听取各方面的意见，以便从中找出主要矛盾，使领导者早日心中有数。常委会觉得这种作法还是较好的。
    常委会讨论了整风和工作两不误的问题。大家认为要保证两不误，最重要的是要把整风期间的工作进行合理的安排，要抓紧主要的工作，撇开一些次要的工作。同时要认识，整风只是解决关键性的思想作风问题，不能把整风和工作完全当成一回事，企图把工作中的许多具体问题都放在整风中去解决的作法，这样做就会失掉整风的意义，使整风不能成为马克思主义的思想运动。
    常委会讨论了整风的领导问题，认为整风必须由各部委的党组领导，党组的负责同志应该亲自负责，不能把领导责任交给二三把手。可是，至今仍然有一两个单位的党组负责同志不愿担负领导责任。常委会将在整风规划中明确提出这个问题。
