    Welcome Cambodian Sports Delegation
    Zhang Lianhua, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation
    The Cambodian sports delegation has come to China, and we express our warm welcome. Last December, I had the opportunity to visit your beautiful and ancient country with the Shanghai football team, making a very meaningful and unforgettable journey. I felt very honored. During the visit, almost every time I met Cambodian friends, I couldn't help but talk about our common wish: "When can we meet in Beijing?" "How pleasant and happy it would be to gather in China!" Now this wish has been realized. The Cambodian Sports Federation accepted the invitation of the All-China Sports Federation and sent a Cambodian sports delegation (including a football team) to our capital on the eve of the great "May Day." How exciting and happy this is! Dear friends, please allow me to extend a heartfelt and warm welcome to you in the name of friends and brothers.
    We all know that China and Cambodia are brotherly countries, and the friendly relations and exchanges between the people of China and Cambodia have a long history. However, due to the obstruction of the colonialists, the friendly relations between our two peoples were artificially hindered and destroyed. In recent years, our friendly relations have begun to recover, especially after the visit of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk of your country to China and the visit of our Premier Zhou Enlai to your country, the friendly relations between our two peoples have entered a new stage and have been further developed. The visit of the Shanghai football team to Cambodia and the visit of the sports delegation of your country to China are good proofs of this new development of friendly relations.
    The friendly visits we made in your beautiful country left a deep and unforgettable impression on each of us. From the government to the people, from the cities to the countryside, from the athletes to the audience, everyone was so warm and kind. We truly felt like we were visiting relatives and brothers. The King, Queen, and Prince Sihanouk awarded us Cambodian sports medals. Prince Sihanouk and ministers personally attended and watched the football matches. This high honor and deep friendship given to Chinese athletes and the Chinese people is something we will never forget. The visits to Phnom Penh, Kampot Province, Siem Reap Province, and other places enabled us to learn a lot of knowledge and meet many friends. The more we understand Cambodia, the more we find the Cambodian country and people more and more lovely.
    The development of football in your country has a very long history and a broad mass base. Therefore, the Cambodian football team is a strong team with a high level of technical skill. In recent years, they have won victories in matches with football teams from Thailand, South Vietnam, Sweden, Austria, and other countries, and have therefore received a lot of praise internationally. How fortunate it was for the Shanghai football team to have the opportunity to visit your country and exchange experiences with your country's football players! The three matches in Phnom Penh gave our athletes a good opportunity to learn. The proactive and aggressive spirit, the ability to seize opportunities to attack, the friendly attitude, the rich experience, and the skilled techniques shown by your country's football team left an extremely deep impression on me and enabled us to learn a lot of things. The wonderful performance of your country's famous athlete, goalkeeper Yang De, was praised by every member of our team. I am convinced that the twenty football players who have come with the delegation will also have wonderful performances and achieve complete success in their visits and matches in our capital and other cities. Undoubtedly, this will play a good role in promoting the development of football and improving the technical level in our country.
    During our visit to your country, we had friendly contact and close conversations with friends in the sports field in your country, thus developing our friendly relations. The visit to China of the Cambodian sports delegation, including representatives from various organizations such as the Cambodian Olympic Committee, the Football Association, and the Athletics Association, gives us another opportunity to strengthen our friendly relations and exchange work experience. Undoubtedly, this will play a good role in promoting the friendly relations between sports organizations and sports workers in China and Cambodia and promoting the development and improvement of sports in China and Cambodia. I would like to take this opportunity to pay my respects to the representatives of the Cambodian sports organizations.
    From the first day we returned to China, we have been eagerly awaiting our Cambodian friends to visit our country. Now that we have finally waited for it, I would like, in the name of Chinese sports workers and athletes, to extend a heartfelt and warm welcome to our close friends and brothers, the friendly envoys of the Cambodian people and athletes—the Cambodian sports delegation visiting our country for the first time, and wish the Cambodian sports delegation friends success in their visits and matches in our country, and wish Cambodian sports new achievements.

    欢迎柬埔寨体育代表团
    中华全国体育总会秘书长  张联华
    柬埔寨体育代表团到中国来了，我们表示热烈的欢迎。去年12月，我有机会随着上海足球队去访问你们美丽而古老的国家，作了一次很有意义和使人永远不会忘记的美好的旅行，我感到非常荣幸。在访问期间，差不多每一次我和柬埔寨朋友们见面的时候，都情不自禁地谈到我们的一个共同愿望：“什么时候我们能在北京见面？”“能在中国欢聚该是多么愉快和幸福啊”！现在这个愿望已经实现了，柬埔寨体育总会接受中华全国体育总会的邀请，派遣的柬埔寨体育代表团（包括一个足球队）在伟大的“五一”节前夕来到了我们的首都，这该是多么令人兴奋和快乐啊！亲爱的朋友们，请允许我以朋友和兄弟的名义向你们致以衷心的热烈的欢迎。
    我们都知道，中柬两国是兄弟之邦，中柬两国人民之间的友好联系和来往是有悠久的历史的。可是后来由于殖民主义者的阻碍，我们两国人民的友好联系受到了人为的阻挠和破坏，最近几年来，我们的友好联系开始重新恢复，特别是贵国西哈努克亲王访问我国和我国周恩来总理访问贵国之后，我们两国人民之间的友好联系走上了新的阶段，得到了新的发展，上海足球队的访问柬埔寨和贵国体育代表团访问我国就是这种友好联系新的发展的很好的证明。
    我们在你们美丽的国家所进行的友好访问，给我们每个人都留下了深刻的难忘的印象。从政府到人民，从城市到乡村，从运动员到观众都是那样热烈而亲切，我们真像到了亲戚家里一样，兄弟家里一样。国王王后及西哈努克亲王给我们赠送柬埔寨体育勋章，西哈努克亲王及各部大臣亲自出席参观了足球比赛，这种给予中国运动员及中国人民的崇高荣誉和深厚友谊，是我们永远不能忘记的。在金边市、贡不省，暹粒省等地的参观和访问，使我们学习到了很多知识，认识了很多朋友。我们对柬埔寨了解的越多，我们就觉得柬埔寨国家和人民越加可爱。
    在你们的国家里足球运动的发展，是有很悠久的历史和广泛的群众基础的。因而柬埔寨足球队是一支具有高度技术水平的足球劲旅，最近几年来和泰国、南越、瑞典、奥地利等国足球队比赛都得到胜利，因而在国际上获得了很多的称赞，上海足球队有机会访问你们国家并和贵国足球运动员互相观摩，交流经验，该是多么幸运啊！金边的三场比赛，给了我们运动员一个良好的学习机会，贵国足球队所表现的主动积极，善于抓住机会进攻的精神，友好的态度，丰富的经验，熟练的技术，给我留下了极其深刻的印象，使我们学到了很多的东西。像贵国名运动员“门将”杨德的精彩表演，受到了我们每个人员的称赞。我深信，随着代表团一起前来的二十位足球运动员，在我国首都及其他城市的访问比赛，一定也会有精彩的表演并得到完全的成功，无疑的这对于我国足球运动的开展和技术水平的提高，将会起着很好的推动作用。
    在贵国访问期间，我们和贵国体育界的朋友们作过友好的接触和亲密的交谈，从而发展了我们之间的友好联系。这次包括柬埔寨奥林匹克委员会，足球协会、田径协会，等各个组织的代表的柬埔寨体育代表团诸位先生的来华访问，就再一次给我们加强友好联系和交流工作经验的机会，无疑的这对于增进中柬两国体育组织，体育工作者之间的友好联系和推动中柬两国体育运动的发展和提高，都会起着良好的作用。我愿就此机会向柬埔寨体育组织的各位代表先生致以敬意。
    我们从回国的第一天起，就在眼巴巴的盼望着我们柬埔寨的朋友们来我国访问，现在终于盼望到了，我谨以中国体育工作者和运动员的名义，向我们亲密的朋友和兄弟，柬埔寨人民和运动员的友好使者——第一次来我国访问的柬埔寨体育代表团，表示衷心地热烈的欢迎，并祝柬埔寨体育代表团诸位朋友在我国的访问和比赛获得成功，祝柬埔寨体育运动获得新的成就。
