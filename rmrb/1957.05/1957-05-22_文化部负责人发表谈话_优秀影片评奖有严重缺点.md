Xinhua News Agency, 21st: After the Ministry of Culture held a national award ceremony for excellent films from 1949-1955 in March this year, various parties have had different opinions on the awards. A Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed the head of the Ministry of Culture on this issue. He made the following statement to the reporter:

The person in charge said that in order to further promote film production and make films better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialist construction, it is correct to summarize artistic achievements and encourage filmmakers to better develop and flourish creation through awards. However, this award process had serious shortcomings.

He said that this award, according to the method of "after a film is awarded a prize, the main creators should be awarded medals according to the award level," one-sidedly emphasized the film's award, and did not differentiate between the quality of the film and the artistic achievements of the film's main creators. This led to unfair and unreasonable phenomena. For example, although some creators have made significant achievements in long-term work, they have not been able to win awards because they have not had work opportunities in recent years or the films they participated in have not won awards. Some film artists with many years of performing history and high artistic creation levels have made many contributions to China's film industry. The artistic images they have created have always lived in the hearts of the broad audience, and their names have also been familiar and respected by the broad audience due to their artistic creations. However, because the films they participated in did not win first prizes, but second or third prizes, they were also rated as second or third prize winners along with the films. Some people criticize this kind of award for film actors as "marry a chicken, follow the chicken," which can be described as incisive. In fact, an actor's artistic labor is not embodied in one or two films. Since the national award is conducted over a relatively long period of time, full consideration should be given to an actor's long-term artistic labor achievements, which is fair and reasonable. The Ministry of Culture did not seriously consider these issues and did not conduct individual artistic evaluations of the main creators of the film. This clearly shows subjectivism in the work. In the future, film awards should change this unreasonable method and should award excellent films and individual achievements of creators separately.

He said that this award was also not fair and reasonable to the productions of private film companies. The films produced by private factories after the national liberation should be given appropriate awards based on the historical conditions of their specific production periods to consider the value of the film. This time, the awards for films produced by private factories were too low, which reflected a lack of overall perspective and sectarianism, which was inappropriate. For this reason, the Ministry of Culture decided to issue a first prize to the private factory film "Crows and Sparrows."

The person in charge pointed out that this award method is imperfect and has great one-sidedness. This selection was based on each film studio submitting initially selected films and indicating evaluation opinions, and then approved by the Ministry of Culture. Although this selection method partially reflects the opinions of the masses, it is basically still an administrative method of evaluation and lacks a mass basis. Film is the most extensive mass comprehensive art, and every film has its thousands of viewers, who are the best judges of the film. National awards should be combined with social awards, and the long-term social evaluation of each film and each artistic creator should be used as the basis for national awards, so as to accurately reflect the level of film art.

### 文化部负责人发表谈话  优秀影片评奖有严重缺点

    文化部负责人发表谈话
    优秀影片评奖有严重缺点
    片面强调影片的评奖，而对影片的质量和主要创作人员的艺术成就没有加以区别对待，以致出现了不公平现象，这是工作中的主观主义的表现。同时，对私营影片公司的出品评价过低，也反映出了缺乏全局观念的宗派主义思想。决定补行发给“乌鸦与麻雀”以一等奖。
    新华社21日讯　今年3月间，文化部举行了一次全国性的1949—1955年的优秀影片评奖以后，各方面对这次评奖有着不同的看法。新华社记者为此访问文化部负责人。他就这个问题向记者发表了如下的谈话：
    负责人说，为了进一步繁荣影片生产，使电影更好地为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务，用评奖的形式总结一下艺术的成就，鼓励电影工作者更好地发展创作，繁荣创作，这是正确的。但是，这次评奖工作有严重的缺点。
    他说，这次评奖按照“影片被评得奖后应按得奖等级授予主要创作人员以奖章”的办法，片面地强调了影片的评奖，而对影片的质量和影片的主要创作人员的艺术成就没有加以区别对待。这样就出现了不公平，不合理的现象。例如某些创作人员虽然在长期劳动中有显著的成绩，但是由于近年来没有工作机会或者他所参加工作的影片未得奖，而本人也就未能得奖。一些有多年表演历史的电影艺术家，有很高的艺术创作水平，对于我国电影事业也有很多的贡献，他们历来塑造的艺术形象都活在广大观众的心目里，他们本人的名字，也由于历来的艺术创作，为广大观众所熟悉和尊敬，但是，因为他们参加演出的影片，没有获得一等奖，而是获得二等奖或三等奖，于是，他们也就随着影片而被评为二三等奖的获得者。另一方面，有一部分青年演员，他们的艺术成就还不很高，但是由于在影片中担任了主要演员，他们就和影片获得了同样的奖励。有人批评这种对电影演员的评奖是“嫁鸡随鸡”，可称一针见血。实际上，一个演员的艺术劳动，并不体现在一部或两部影片里。既然国家评奖是在一个比较长的时间里进行的，那就应该充分考虑到一个演员的长期的艺术劳动的成果，这才是公正合理的。文化部没有严肃认真地考虑到这些问题，没有对影片的主要创作者作个别的艺术评比，这明显地表现出了工作中的主观主义。今后电影评奖，应该改变这种不合理的办法，应该把优秀影片同创作人员的个人成就分别来评奖。
    他说，这次评奖对私营影片公司的出品也不够公平和合理。私营厂在全国解放后摄制的影片，应该根据其具体摄制时期的历史条件来考虑影片的价值而给以恰当的评奖。这次对私营厂摄制的影片的评奖过低，这反映出了缺乏全局观念的宗派主义思想，是不妥当的。为此，文化部决定补行发给私营厂影片“乌鸦与麻雀”以一等奖。
    负责人指出，这次评奖方式不完善，带有极大的片面性。这次评选，是由各制片厂提出初选影片，并注明评定意见，然后由文化部批准。这种评选方式，虽然也部分地反映了群众的意见，但是基本上仍然是行政方式的评定，缺乏群众基础。电影是最广泛的群众性的综合艺术，每一部影片都有它的成千成万的观众，他们是影片的最好的评奖人。国家的评奖应该和社会评奖结合起来进行，而且应该以长期的对每一部影片、每一个艺术创作者的社会品评，作为国家评奖的基础，这样才能比较准确地反映出电影艺术的水平。
