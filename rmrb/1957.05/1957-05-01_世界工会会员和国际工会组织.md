    World Trade Union Membership and International Trade Union Organizations

    Question: What is the total number of trade union members worldwide? Which country has the largest number of trade union members?

    Answer: Currently, there are nearly 160 million trade union members worldwide. This demonstrates the tremendous growth of the organized power of the working class. On the eve of the First World War, there were only 9 million trade union members worldwide; by 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, trade union membership had increased to 60 million; in 1945, it increased by another 10 million compared to 1939.

    Among the countries of the world, the Soviet Union has the largest number of trade union members, currently boasting over 42 million members.

    Question: What are the main international trade union federations currently?

    Answer: Currently, there are two main international trade union federations: the World Federation of Trade Unions and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

    World Federation of Trade Unions

    At the initiative of the Soviet trade unions and with the support of trade unions from countries such as Britain and France, the World Trade Union Congress was held in Paris on September 25, 1945, represented by trade union delegates from 56 countries representing approximately 64 million workers. This congress established the first largest international organization in the history of the labor movement - the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    The aim of the WFTU is to organize and unite trade unions around the world, regardless of race, nationality, religious belief, or political views. Its main tasks are to organize the joint struggles of trade unions in various countries, to assist workers in economically underdeveloped countries to establish trade unions, to maintain peace, to oppose wars of aggression, and to fight for the economic and social interests of the working class. For more than ten years, it has carried out much effective work in maintaining peace and safeguarding the vital interests of the international working class. Its prestige and influence are constantly growing. It currently has 88 million members. The headquarters of the WFTU is located in Prague.

    International Confederation of Free Trade Unions

    In January 1949, the American CIO and the British TUC withdrew from the WFTU. Subsequently, more than 20 trade unions, mainly from Western European countries, controlled by right-wing leaders, also withdrew from the WFTU. In December of the same year, the right-wing leaders of the American AFL, CIO, and the British TUC colluded and established the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" (ICFTU for short) in London.

    The "ICFTU" loudly proclaims that it is a "pure trade union movement," but many of its propositions and activities are not in the interests of the working class. It has repeatedly expressed its support for the United States' aggressive policies and activities that endanger peace. It refuses the proposals of the WFTU to carry out joint actions to strengthen the strength and struggle of the working class. The "ICFTU's" attitude, which is detrimental to the united action of the working class, has aroused dissatisfaction among its growing number of grassroots organizations. At present, calls within the "ICFTU" for changing policies and realizing the unity of the international trade union movement are growing.

    Last July, the "ICFTU" announced that it had 54.5 million members, distributed in 83 countries and regions. Its headquarters are located in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. (Weng Bai)

    世界工会会员和国际工会组织
    问：全世界共有多少工会会员？哪一个国家的工会会员人数最多？
    答：目前世界各地共有近一亿六千万工会会员。这说明工人阶级有组织的力量有了巨大的增长。在第一次世界大战前夕，世界各国工会会员只有九百万人；到第二次世界大战前夕的1939年，工会会员增加到六千万人；1945年又比1939年增加了一千万工会会员。
    在世界各国中，苏联工会的会员人数最多，目前它共拥有四千二百多万会员。
    问：目前有哪些主要的国际性工会联合会？
    答：目前主要的国际工会联合会有两个，它们是“世界工会联合会”和“国际自由工会联合会”。
    世界工会联合会
    在苏联工会的倡议和英法等国工会的支持下，1945年9月25日代表约六千四百万工人的五十六个国家的工会代表在巴黎举行了世界工会代表大会，成立了工人运动史上第一个最大的国际性组织——世界工会联合会。
    世界工联的宗旨是：不分种族、国籍、宗教信仰和政治见解，组织和团结全世界的工会。它的主要任务是：组织各国工会的共同斗争，协助经济不发达国家内的工人建立工会，维护和平，反对侵略战争，为保卫工人阶级的经济和社会利益而斗争。十多年来，它在维护和平、保卫国际工人阶级切身利益的事业方面进行了许多卓有成效的工作。它的威望和影响不断在增长。目前它拥有会员八千八百万人。世界工联的总部设在布拉格。
    国际自由工会联合会
    1949年1月，美国产联和英国职工大会退出了世界工联。接着，主要是西欧国家的二十多个由右翼领袖控制的工会也退出了世界工联。同年12月，美国的劳联、产联以及英国的职工大会的右翼领袖，纠合了这些工会在伦敦成立了“国际自由工会联合会”（简称“自由工联”）。
    “自由工联”大事宣传它是“纯粹的工会运动”，但它的许多主张和活动，并不符合工人阶级的利益。它曾一再表示支持美国的侵略政策和危害和平的活动。拒绝世界工联提出的进行联合行动以加强工人阶级的力量和斗争的建议。“自由工联”这种不利于工人阶级统一行动的态度，引起了它的越来越多的基层组织的不满。目前，“自由工联”内部要求改变政策和实现国际工会运动统一的呼声日益高涨。
    去年7月，“自由工联”宣布它有会员五千四百五十万人，分布在八十三个国家和地区。它的总部设在比利时首都布鲁塞尔。  （翁白）
