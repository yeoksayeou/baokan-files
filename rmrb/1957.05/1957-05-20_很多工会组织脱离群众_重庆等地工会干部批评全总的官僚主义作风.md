Special Manuscript from This Newspaper　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ren Zhiqiao Reports: The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions recently held forums for grassroots trade union chairmen and engineering and technical personnel. According to those who attended the forum, many trade union organizations are out of touch with the masses, which has had a very bad impact on workers. Workers say: Some trade unions only manage to collect membership fees and don't care about the interests of workers; trade unions and the administration speak with one voice, and they have simply become "government-run trade unions." In the re-election of the trade union at the Beijing Paint Factory, the Party branch insisted that workers elect someone who was unpopular with the workers as the trade union chairman, which aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of workers.

Everyone sharply criticized the bureaucratic work style of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and some industrial trade unions for not going deep into reality and being indifferent to the problems of grassroots trade unions for a long time. The chairman of the Beijing Knitting Factory Trade Union said that the Beijing trade union organization had led many competitions, but almost all of them were tight at the beginning and loose at the end, like a tiger with a snake's tail. Tang Fugen, chairman of the trade union of the Printing Factory of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, said that the leading cadres of the Municipal Printing Trade Union only frequently asked them to report, and had only been to their factory two or three times in the past two or three years.

　Alienated from Workers　Ideologies Rust
Special Manuscript from This Newspaper　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Tao Suqi Reports: Wu Yun of the Production Department of the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions said: In 1948, our working methods were the same as those of the land reform work team. We went to various factories all day long and slept in workers' dormitories at night, and we got along with the workers like brothers, and we talked about everything. After 1952, the trade union established many departments, and the departments were divided into very detailed tasks. Everyone specialized in one business, such as doing production department work, only dealing with a few labor models. We became alienated from the workers, and thus drew a line between us and the workers. We knew very few workers, and we didn't understand the workers' ideological situation at all. Our own ideologies also rusted. How can we represent the workers and solve problems for the workers!

Liu Aiguo, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial Coal Mine Trade Union of China, said: The letters and visits received by the coal mine trade union are nothing more than problems such as wages and public bonds. Some higher-level trade unions push these problems away if they can. Grassroots trade unions are very afraid of accidents. In fact, if the higher-level trade unions are willing to do it, they can solve some problems.

　Excessive Emphasis on Vertical Leadership
　Increases Difficulties in Local Work
Special Manuscript from This Newspaper　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lu Xilin Reports: Wei Mingguang, vice chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said that last year the All-China Federation of Trade Unions decided to strengthen the work of industrial trade unions and emphasized the vertical leadership of the industrial trade union system, but the responsibilities of local joint trade unions and local industrial trade unions were not clearly defined, which caused many difficulties in the work of local trade unions. Some work is difficult for the local joint trade union to intervene because the national industrial trade union emphasizes vertical leadership and the pace is inconsistent with the local joint trade union. In some work, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the municipal industrial trade unions each make a set of arrangements, and the requirements are different, which brings many difficulties to the work of grassroots trade unions.

The cadres of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said that Chongqing is too far away from Beijing. Since the establishment of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, very few people have come to Chongqing to inspect work. Even if someone comes, they only investigate materials and ask for situations and figures. As soon as the materials are in hand, they leave, and they rarely help to study the situation of the workers' movement in Chongqing and how to improve the work of the trade union. Some cadres have a big air, wanting to live in high-level cadre guesthouses and be picked up and dropped off by cars. In daily business guidance, there are many principled instructions and few specific methods.

　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Has Bulky Organizations
　Lower Levels Are Busy Coping
Special Manuscript from This Newspaper　Several Standing Committee members of the Taiyuan Federation of Trade Unions said that the resolution of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions was correct, but in the implementation of the resolution of the Seventh National Congress, too much emphasis was placed on facing production and acting in unison with the Party and the administration, and the task of the trade union to safeguard the interests of the working masses was not emphasized at the same time. As a result, grassroots trade unions did not dare to say different things to the administrative departments, and the trade union became the "second production section of the factory."

They pointed out that when advocating the use of activists, the sudden large reduction of full-time cadres of the trade union not only caused the weakness and powerlessness of grassroots trade unions, but also mechanically classified cadres above the trade union group leader as activists, resulting in one-third of the cadres who actually did not play a role obtaining the title of "activist."

The trade union cadres also believe that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has a bulky organization and too detailed division of labor. This situation is out of touch with the situation where grassroots trade unions only have two or three full-time cadres, making the lower levels busy coping, and there is no time to go deep into the masses to do trade union work. The division of labor between the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the national industrial trade unions is also unclear, resulting in overlapping institutions below and the dispersion of manpower and funds.

　Trade Union "Takes on Too Much" and Accomplishes Nothing Well
Special Manuscript from This Newspaper　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Jiansheng Reports: A trade union cadre from Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 said that since the second half of last year, in leading the workers' movement, is it about grasping production? Is it about grasping ideological education? Or is it about grasping the workers' welfare issues? There is no clear idea in mind. He believes that this issue should be resolved by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. If this problem is not solved, not only will the trade union cadres be depressed, but it will also cause the trade union to be out of touch with the masses and out of touch with reality.

He felt that the trade union "took on too much," such as the factory trade union having thirteen committees such as the Production Work Committee and the Rationalization Proposal Committee. He said that in fact, according to regulations, our factory only has seven full-time trade union cadres, two of whom are chairmen of the workshops (according to regulations, a production workshop with more than 500 people has a full-time trade union chairman), how can this be done? Therefore, some workers reflect: The trade union has not handled any problems well.

### 很多工会组织脱离群众  重庆等地工会干部批评全总的官僚主义作风

    很多工会组织脱离群众
    重庆等地工会干部批评全总的官僚主义作风
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者任志樵报道：北京市工会联合会日前分别召开基层工会主席和工程技术人员座谈会。据参加座谈会的人反映：很多工会组织脱离群众已经在职工中造成很坏的影响。工人说：有些工会光管收会费，不关心职工的利益；工会和行政一鼻孔出气，简直成了“官办工会”。北京市油漆厂在改选工会中，党支部硬要工人把一个不受职工欢迎的人选作工会主席，引起广大职工的不满。
    大家对北京市工会联合会和一些产业工会不深入实际、长期对基层工会的问题漠不关心的官僚主义作风，提出了尖锐的批评。北京市针织厂工会主席说，北京市工会组织多次领导竞赛，但差不多都是前紧后松、虎头蛇尾。第一机械部印刷厂工会主席唐富根说，市印刷工会的领导干部只经常找他们汇报，两三年来只到他们工厂去过两三趟。
    疏远工人　思想生锈
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者陶肃琦报道：哈尔滨工会联合会生产部吴云说：1948年时我们的工作方法和土改工作队一样，整天到各个工厂去，晚上也睡在工人宿舍里，和工人搞得像亲兄弟似的，什么话都讲。1952年以后，工会建立了许多部，部里又分工很细，每个人专一门业务，像做生产部工作，只和几个劳动模范打交道。同工人疏远了，这样就和工人划了一条沟。相熟的工人很少，工人的思想情况都不了解。自己的思想也生锈了。这怎能代表工人，给工人解决问题呢！
    中国煤矿工会黑龙江省筹备委员会主任刘爱国说：煤矿工会接到的来信来访不外是工资和公债等问题，有的上级工会对这些问题能推就推，基层工会非常怕出事，实际上上级工会如果肯作是能解决一些问题的。
    过分强调垂直领导
    增加地方工作困难
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者吕希林报道：重庆市工会联合会副主席魏明光说，去年全总决定加强产业工会工作，强调产业工会系统的垂直领导，而对地方联合工会和地方产业工会的职责没有划分清楚，使地方工会工作遇到很多困难。有的工作因为全国产业工会强调垂直领导，和地方联合工会的步调不一致，使地方联合工会难于插手。有的工作市工会联合会和市里各产业工会各布置一套，要求又不一样，给基层工会工作带来许多困难。
    重庆市工会联合会的干部说，重庆距离北京太远，从全总成立以来，就很少有人来重庆检查工作，即使有人来了，也只是调查材料，要情况，要数字，材料一到手就走了，很少帮助研究重庆市的工人运动情况和如何改进工会工作。有的干部来了架子很大，要住高干招待所，来去要汽车接，汽车送。在日常业务指导上，原则指示多，具体办法少。
    全总机构臃肿
    下级忙于应付
    本报特约新华社专稿　太原工会联合会的几位常务委员们说，中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议是正确的，但是在执行七大决议中，过多地强调了面向生产、和党、行政一致行动，而没有同时强调工会必须维护工人群众的利益的任务。这样做的结果，就产生了基层工会不敢同行政部门说两样话，使工会变成了“工厂的第二生产科”。
    他们指出，在提倡使用积极分子的时候，突然大量减少工会的专职干部，这不仅造成基层工会的软弱无力，而且由于机械地把工会小组长以上干部都划为积极分子，结果使三分之一实际上没有起作用的干部获得了“积极分子”的称号。
    工会干部们还认为全国总工会的机构臃肿，分工过细。这种状况和基层工会只有两、三个专职干部的状况是脱节的，使下级忙于应付，而没有时间深入群众中去做工会工作。全总同全国性的产业工会分工也不明确，以致造成下边机构重叠，人力和资金的分散。
    工会“揽载”过多啥事也没办好
    本报特约专稿　新华社记者刘健生报道：郑州国棉一厂一位工会干部说，从去年下半年以来，在领导工人运动中，是抓生产？是抓思想教育？还是抓工人的福利问题？心中没有数。他认为这个问题应该由全总来解决。不解决这个问题，不但工会干部苦闷，而且使工会脱离群众，脱离现实。
    他感到工会“揽载”过多，如厂工会里有生产工作委员会、合理化建议委员会等十三个会。他说，实际上我们厂里按规定只有七个脱产的工会干部，其中还有两个人是担任车间的工会主席（按规定超过五百人的生产车间，有一个脱产的工会主席），这怎么能作得了？所以有的工人反映：工会啥问题也没办好。
