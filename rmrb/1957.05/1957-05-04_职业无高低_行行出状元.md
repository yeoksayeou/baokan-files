Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd - More than one hundred junior middle school students and senior elementary school graduates in Harbin have taken up work in service industries such as hotels, barber shops, bathhouses, restaurants, photography studios, and laundries.

Some of these junior middle school students and senior elementary school graduates are learning various skills from their fathers and older brothers. Some have already made good achievements in their positions. Last October, the Nangang Hotel in Harbin took in nine senior elementary school graduates as service personnel. When selecting advanced workers for the fourth quarter, six of the senior elementary school graduates were selected as advanced workers of the First Welfare Company of Harbin. Ji Guilan and Du Fenglan, both senior elementary school graduates, are the two most popular service personnel in this hotel. When they are on duty, guests rarely see them sitting idle. They are either wiping tables and chairs or busying themselves with tea and water, finding books and newspapers, and buying theater tickets for the guests, and even washing clothes for the guests. Guests report that staying in this hotel feels like being at home. The guests’ suggestion books in the fourteen rooms cared for by Du Fenglan and Ji Guilan all contain words of praise for them. Ji Guilan's parents and older brothers not only do not discourage her from participating in this work, but also often write to encourage her to work hard, not to despise this profession, and hope that she can become a model worker like Wu Guilan, the commercial model worker in Harbin.

Ju Guiqin, a senior elementary school graduate, has parents and older brothers who are all engaged in barbering. Now, she is learning barbering skills diligently from her parents and older brothers. Peng Guanglan, a senior elementary school graduate, joined the Yongxin branch of the laundry industry as a service worker. From the very beginning, she took the initiative to solicit business from factories and organizations. Sometimes she braved wind and snow to factories and organizations twenty or thirty li away to pick up laundry, often sweating profusely, but reluctant to spend money to hire a car for transportation. Her spirit of hard work and endurance has been praised by her colleagues.

    职业无高低　行行出状元
    新华社哈尔滨3日电　哈尔滨市已经有一百多名初中学生和高小毕业生参加旅馆、理发、浴池、饭馆、照像、洗染等服务性行业工作。
    这些初中学生和高小毕业生有的是跟随自己父兄学习各种技艺。有些已在工作岗位上做出良好成绩。哈尔滨南岗旅社去年10月吸收九名高小毕业生做服务员，到评选第四季度先进工作者时，就有六名高小毕业生当选为哈尔滨市第一福利公司的先进工作者。高小毕业生季桂兰、杜凤兰是这个旅馆里两位最受旅客欢迎的服务员。在她们值班的时候，旅客们很少看到她们空着手闲坐，不是擦抹桌椅就是替旅客张罗茶水、找书报、买戏票，甚至替旅客洗衣服。旅客反映住在这个旅馆里好像住在自己家里一样。杜凤兰、季桂兰照管的十四个房间，每个房间的旅客意见簿上都有表扬她们的话语。季桂兰的父兄不但不阻挠她参加这个工作，而且经常来信鼓励她好好工作，不要轻视这行职业，并希望她像哈尔滨市商业工作模范吴桂兰那样也能成为工作模范。
    高小毕业生居桂琴的父兄都从事理发工作，现在她正在安心地跟自己的父兄学习理发技艺。高小毕业生彭光兰参加了洗染业永新门市部当服务员，一开始工作她就主动提出要到工厂、机关招揽活计。有时她冒着风雪跑到二三十里以外的工厂、机关去拿活回来，常常累得满头大汗，也舍不得花钱雇车搬运。她这吃苦耐劳的精神，受到了同事们的赞扬。
