Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 19th (Special Correspondent Chen Rijin): Leaders of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have sharply criticized the local Communist Party organizations' sectarianism in several recent symposiums. These symposiums were hosted separately by the United Front Work Departments of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

At the symposium, Luo Yiqun, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, said that the Communist Party has a sense of superiority and often regards itself as a special class. Democratic figures have a sense of inferiority and dare not make friends with Communist Party members or talk to them openly, so the estrangement becomes deeper and it is difficult to achieve unity. He said that some people say the Communist Party is the master and the democratic parties are the guests, and even say that the democratic parties are "servants." I think saying "servants" is a bit excessive, but the Communist Party should never think that it is superior in every way. In the past few years, the Communist Party members have developed rapidly. The advantage is that the scope is wide and in-depth, but were these party members truly earned their membership through active work? I am afraid that some have used the means of attacking others to elevate themselves. He said that there is also a crisis in this. He hoped that the Communist Party would carefully pay attention to those who like to gossip when recruiting party members; and requested that the Communist Party focus on solving the ideological understanding of party members on sectarianism in this rectification movement.

Yun Yinglin, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, believes that there is a key to truly playing the role of mutual supervision, that is, to eliminate the bad atmosphere in society that only praises the Communist Party. He said that this atmosphere, whether in rural areas, state organs, or various meetings, makes people only say that the Communist Party is very good, very good, and dare not raise different opinions, especially the party leading cadres do not dare to criticize the shortcomings of the party's leadership. He said this is disloyal to the Party. However, he said that some Communist Party members really do not like others to say unpleasant things. If others say them, they will say that others' positions are unstable and have bad intentions. He went on to say that we non-party members feel that there is a danger in saying unpleasant things, so we dare not say it anymore.

Huang Changshui, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that those so-called activists especially like to flatter party members, which aggravates the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism of some party leading cadres. When he mentioned the serious sectarianism of some party members, he said that he often heard party members say "we" and "you" to the masses outside the party; when adjusting levels, more party members were promoted and fewer non-party cadres were promoted; some blackboards became gardens dedicated to criticizing non-party cadres. He also said that old party members cannot be identified as party members at a glance, but new party members can be recognized at a glance, because they have a "I lead you" attitude. He reflected that some people outside the party say that these people are "little emperors."

Huang Changshui said: Small joint ventures have both public representatives and party branches. As a result of the multiple layers, no one knows who is in charge, and they shirk responsibility when something happens. In industrial and commercial enterprises, many party members pretend to understand and act arbitrarily. He said, I think that a few party members leading enterprises cannot give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, so the question of whether enterprises need party organizations to lead them is indeed worth considering.

Chen Qiu'an, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, criticized the special thinking of Communist Party members in schools. He said that they contacted the masses before joining the party, but once they joined the party, they were aloof, and it seemed that they were not like a party member if they did not put on airs. Non-party teachers are always a little inferior and dare not speak boldly. The reason is that party members and personnel cadres in the school are very rude to teachers. He said that the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy compared the party members of the personnel department to Tang Sanzang, and the non-party teachers to Sun Wukong. They said that although Sun Wukong went through all kinds of dangers, dispelled ghosts and demons, and paved the way for Tang Sanzang to go to the Western Paradise, Tang Sanzang often had to chant the Tightening Spell, making Sun Wukong in unbearable pain. And Zhu Bajie? Like the party and league members in the school, although they have no skills, they are protected by Tang Sanzang. Therefore, teachers say that some party members are "attacking! attacking!" to democratic figures, and democratic figures have to "obey, obey."

Huang Rongzeng, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Luo Xiongcai, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Xu Shunying, Standing Committee Member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Deng Wenzhao, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Zibin, Deputy Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Zifan, Member of the Central Committee of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Xu Xiangong, Director of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society, and democratic figures who are currently directors of various departments and bureaus in Guangdong Province, also criticized the fact that the relationship between the party and non-party figures is not close enough, some Communist Party members do not respect the powers of democratic figures in their thoughts and actions, sectarianism that does not trust people outside the party, and the phenomenon that the United Front Work Department does not pay enough attention to the work of the democratic parties.

    广东民主人士连日举行座谈会
    黄长水说：“企业是否需要党组织来领导，值得考虑”
    本报特约新华社广州19日电  新华社记者陈日晶报道：广东省、广州市各民主党派的负责人和无党派民主人士，在最近举行的几次座谈会上，尖锐地批评当地共产党组织的宗派主义。这些座谈会是由中共广东省委员会和中共广州市委员会的统一战线工作部分别主持的。
    座谈会上，中国国民党革命委员会中央委员、广东省人民委员会参事室副主任罗翼群说，共产党有优越感，往往以特殊阶级自居，民主人士有自卑心，不敢同共产党员交朋友、畅谈心事，于是隔阂愈来愈深，团结就难搞得好了。他说，有人说共产党是主人，民主党派是客人，甚至还说民主党派是“仆从”。我看说“仆从”是过分了一些，不过共产党绝不应该认为自己样样都高人一等。几年来，中共党员发展得很快，好处是面广和深入了，但是这些党员入党是否是真正由积极工作争取得来的呢？恐怕有些是用打击别人抬高自己的手段取得的。他说这样就也有危机了。他希望共产党在吸收党员时要谨慎地注意考察那些好讲是非的人；并要求共产党在这次整风中，要着重解决党员对宗派主义的思想认识问题。
    要真正发挥互相监督的作用，中国农工民主党广东省副主任委员云应霖认为有一个关键，就是一定去掉只向共产党歌功颂德的这种社会上的坏空气。他说，这种空气无论在农村、国家机关或各种会议上，都使人们只说共产党很好、很好，而不敢提出不同的意见，特别是党员领导干部更不敢批评党领导上的缺点。他说，这是对党不忠诚的。但是，他说确实有些共产党员就是不喜欢别人讲不好听的话，别人如果说了，动辄就说别人立场不稳和带有恶意。他接着说，我们非党人士认为讲不好听的话有危险，也就不再敢讲了。
    中国民主建国会广州市委员会主任委员黄长水说，那些所谓积极分子，专门喜欢向党员奉承，这更加重了某些党员领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义。他提到一些党员的严重的宗派主义表现时说，经常都听到党员对党外群众说“我们”、“你们”；调整级别时，提拔党员多，非党干部就少提拔；有些黑板报，变成专门批评非党干部的园地。他还说，老党员一下子看不出是党员，但是新党员一看就知道了，因为他们大有“我领导你”的姿态。他反映，有些党外群众说这些人是“小皇帝”。
    黄长水说：小型合营工厂有公方又有党支部，层次多的结果是不知谁领导，有事互相推诿。在工商企业中不少党员不懂装懂，包办专权。他说，我认为几个党员领导企业不能发挥群众的积极性，因此企业是否要党组织来领导的问题的确值得考虑。
    中国民主促进会广州市委员会副主任委员陈秋安批评学校中共产党员的特殊思想。他说，他们未入党时联系群众，一入党就高高在上，似乎不摆架子就不像个党员。而非党的教师总有些自卑，有话也不敢大胆讲，其原因是学校的党员和人事干部对教师态度很粗暴生硬。他说，民进的成员将人事部门的党员比喻为唐三藏，非党的教师比为孙悟空。他们说，虽然孙悟空历尽艰险，驱散鬼魔，为唐三藏到西天开辟道路，可是唐三藏却常常要念金箍咒，搞得孙悟空疼痛得无可奈何。而猪八戒呢？就像学校中的党、团员，虽没有什么本事，但却受到唐三藏的袒护。因此，教师们说有些党员对民主人士是“打击！打击！”，而民主人士只好“服从，服从”。
    中国民主同盟广州市委员会副主任委员黄榕增、民盟广东省委员会副主任委员罗雄才、民革广州市委员会常务委员徐舜英、民建广东省工作委员会主任委员邓文钊和民建广州市委员会副主任委员陈子彬、农工民主党中央委员陈卒凡、九三学社广州分社主任委员徐贤恭、以及现任广东省各厅、局长的民主人士，在座谈会上，也都批评了党与非党人士关系不够密切，有些共产党员在思想行动上不尊重民主人士的职权，对党外人士不信任的宗派主义等等，统战部门对民主党派工作不够重视的现象。
