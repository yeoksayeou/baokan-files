Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 26th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali reaffirmed on May 25th that he would continue to firmly pursue the current policy of positive neutrality. He said, "We stand neither on the side of the East nor on the side of the West."

    In a lengthy speech at a press conference, Asali said, "We solemnly declare that we are friends of the Soviet Union, which often supports our just cause and often comes to our rescue. We note with deep regret that imperialism is trying to eliminate us."

    Asali pointed out, "The Soviet Union has consistently extended a hand of friendship to us, and we are friends of the Soviet Union." At the same time, he said, "Communism is a subversive doctrine that may pose a danger to the future of our country."

    Asali also said: "We are working to cultivate hatred for Israel and imperialism in the hearts of our people. Israel, which was established by imperialism to paralyze and oppose the alliance of African and Asian Arabs, is the most serious danger to the future of the Arabs."

    Referring to the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, Asali pointed out that this action was "damnable."

    He continued: "It is undeniable that the United States has given us help; but we must unhappily point out that this help is not selfless, and that the purpose of this help is to achieve other imperialist goals. These goals were later exposed."

    Asali said that at the height of the Suez crisis, when Syria's oil reserves were only enough for one week of use, "only the Soviet Union came to our aid." While "the Americans, Italians, and all other Western countries turned a deaf ear to our appeals."

    Asali said, "These facts are the factors that determine our loyalty to our policy of positive neutrality and to the selfless friendship that the Soviet Union has consistently shown us since 1945."

    叙总理重申坚守积极中立政策
    “苏联经常援救我们，帝国主义却企图消灭我们”
    据新华社26日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利5月25日重申继续坚定地奉行目前的积极中立政策。他说，我们既不站在东方一边，也不站在西方一边。
    阿萨利在记者招待会上发表的长篇谈话中说，“我们严肃地宣布我们是苏联的朋友，苏联经常支持我们的正义事业，经常来援救我们。我们深为遗憾地指出，帝国主义却企图消灭我们。”
    阿萨利指出，“苏联一贯不断地向我们伸出友谊之手，我们是苏联的朋友”。同时他又说，“共产主义是一种颠覆的主义，对我们国家的前途可能构成一种危险”。
    阿萨利还说：“我们努力在我国人民的心中培养对以色列和帝国主义的仇恨。帝国主义为了瘫痪和反对非洲和亚洲阿拉伯人的联盟而建立起来的以色列，对于阿拉伯人的前途来说是一种最严重的危险。”
    阿萨利在提到英法对埃及的侵略时指出，这种行动是“该诅咒的”。
    他接着说：“不可否认，美国给了我们帮助；但是我们必须不愉快地指出，这种帮助并不是无私的，这种帮助的目的是为了达到其他的帝国主义目的。这种目的在后来暴露出来了”。
    阿萨利说，在苏伊士事件的高潮，当叙利亚的石油储备量只够使用一个星期的时候，“只有苏联赶来援助我们。”而“美国人、意大利人和所有其他西方国家对我们的呼吁都充耳不闻”。
    阿萨利说，“这些事实就是决定我们忠于我们的积极中立政策和忠于苏联从1945年以来对我们一贯表现出来的无私友谊的那些因素。”
