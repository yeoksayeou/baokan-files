(Reported by this newspaper) The symposium of heads of democratic parties and non-party democrats held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee continued on the afternoon of the 13th. Those who spoke at the meeting were: Yan Xinmin, member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Wang Zhixiang, member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, Li Boqiu, member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Xiruo, a non-party democrat, and Yuan Hanqing, member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society. In addition, Wu Yan, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, made a written statement.

    Yan Xinmin said
    Most Party Members Discriminate Against Democratic Parties and Cannot Achieve True Equality with the Communist Party
    Yan Xinmin said in his first speech that the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward to solve the problem of equality between the Communist Party and the democratic parties. Because "coexistence" and "mutual" have the meaning of equality. Only when we are in an equal position can we have a sense of being the masters of our own affairs, a sense of responsibility, and can we give full play to our initiative, especially intellectuals who care about face. It seems that the democratic parties and the Communist Party are only equal in politics and law, and are still far from true equality in fact, because the conditions for factual equality do not exist and there is no material basis. The right to equality has been declared, but the democratic parties are not qualified to enjoy this right.

    Although there are progressive and backward elements within the democratic parties, in society, in government departments, schools, and even most Communist Party members (not to mention Communist Youth League members), they believe that the democratic parties are backward and look down on them, discriminating against them everywhere. For example, I am one of the heads of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, but I have never introduced a party member in the past few years, nor have I ever mentioned the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the agency. Of course, the democratic parties themselves have weaknesses such as weak political ideology, unsound organization, and poor cadre conditions, but they are highly representative and have many senior intellectuals, so it is important to work with these people.

    Generally speaking, the Communist Party is strong and progressive, and the democratic parties are weak and backward. It is very difficult to talk about equality under such circumstances. Of course, it is not required that everything be equal to the Communist Party, nor should it be required in this way. But now that the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" has been put forward, the democratic parties must assume some political tasks, so they must look like something. Otherwise, not only will the task not be completed, but coexistence will not be able to coexist. In the past, the United Front Work Department provided a lot of assistance to the democratic parties, but more assistance in terms of affairs, more care for the upper echelons of democrats, and less concern for ideology and politics. Moreover, the scope of the United Front work is very narrow, listening only to a few people, and rarely listening to the words of most people. For example, my own thinking is not open enough, and I have problems and opinions, but the United Front Work Department has never talked to me alone. Only once did Minister Li talk to me about the work of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, and there was no other individual exchange of ideological situations. I personally asked Comrades Xu Bing, Yu Gang, and Wang Feng to talk to me individually. They all agreed at the time, but there was no follow-up.

    For the work of the democratic parties, I hope that the United Front departments from the central government to the local governments will pay more attention to it, help solve problems in a timely manner, do not be afraid of "interfering in internal affairs," and do not overemphasize "independence, freedom, and equality," but provide more assistance. I think that more assistance today can create conditions for letting go and reducing assistance in the future. Of course, accepting help is voluntary, and there is no reason to force anyone who does not want to.

    As much as possible, give the democratic parties some capital. Some theoretical, policy, and current affairs documents and internal party learning reference materials should also be given to the democratic parties. We should also give them more opportunities to participate in report meetings to help people from the democratic parties improve their political and ideological level. In the past, the democratic parties also participated in some activities, but the number of people was always very limited. For example, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Central Committee did not have a single person participate in the recent propaganda work conference convened by the Communist Party Central Committee, while the heads of some of our local organizations did participate.

    Whether the democratic parties can establish regular contact with the units of their work objects (such as the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party can contact the cultural, educational, and health departments), participate in more relevant meetings, and obtain some relevant information on policies and ideological issues from the relevant business departments to facilitate the work of the democratic parties. I hope that the relevant departments can also regard this issue as a political task.

    Wang Zhixiang said
    The United Front Work Department Should Strengthen Contact with Various Democratic Parties
    In his speech, Wang Zhixiang first raised the issue of strengthening contact. He believes that in the past, the contact between the United Front Work Department and the various democratic parties, and between the various democratic parties themselves, was not sufficient. For example, taking the recent relatively major issue—the rectification campaign—since the Party Central Committee issued instructions on rectification, the cadres of our Jiusan Society asked me: Should we rectify? I said: This issue depends on the instructions from the leadership. He believes that the Communist Party and the democratic parties should have contact in advance on such major issues. How to contact? Wang Zhixiang believes: The decision made at this meeting to resume the bi-weekly symposium is very good. In the future, similar issues can be contacted through the bi-weekly symposium. Wang Zhixiang also expressed his support for the establishment of a regular party work symposium and other systems. He also hopes that provinces and cities can also do this if conditions permit.

    Wang Zhixiang also said: Now I very much hope that the leading party will provide more assistance in terms of political ideology and organization.

    Wang Zhixiang also pointed out that the central organ cadres of the Jiusan Society are very difficult, and the establishment is insufficient, especially since the organization has developed twice as much, and the cadres are still the same. He hopes that the United Front Work Department and the Personnel Bureau of the State Council will contact us to help us solve the problem.

    Li Boqiu said
    Party Members Have Privileged Thinking and the CPPCC Neglects Party Work
    When talking about the issue of having position without power, Li Boqiu believes that: Why do non-Party cadres have position without power in responsible positions? Often it is because there are contradictions between the Party's leadership and the administrative leadership. Why do contradictions between the Party's leadership and the administrative leadership occur? Generally speaking, it is because there is sectarianism in the minds of Party members. If sectarianism arises from class feelings, different class origins bring different class feelings, and Communist Party members have been fighting the enemy for a long time, so it is understandable to have this kind of sectarian sentiment. This sentiment can be overcome through long-term cooperation and mutual understanding. However, Li Boqiu believes that another more important reason is: some Communist Party members' privileged thinking. This privileged thinking is the thinking of the past reactionary ruling class. The Party Central Committee educates Party members to "endure hardship first and enjoy happiness later," and that "Communist Party members want to liberate all mankind, have no special rights, only more obligations." However, many Party members have forgotten this education of the Party and mechanically use the principles of class struggle to cover up their privileged thinking; relying on the Party and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's lofty prestige among the people to exercise their privileges. This makes the problem serious. He also gave such an example: The vice president of a hospital in Tianjin is a Communist Party member, and the president is not a Party member. The vice president often decides issues on his own. When the non-Party president criticized him for not discussing it with everyone, he said: What's the matter? I'll take responsibility. The non-Party president said: "Then what do you need me for?" Li Boqiu believes that this is mainly because this Party member does not respect collective leadership and privileged thinking is at play. This is the most concrete manifestation of sectarianism. Therefore, he said: In order to ensure that non-Party members have position and power, in addition to establishing some systems to guarantee specific leadership, it is also necessary to eliminate this privileged thinking in this rectification campaign.

    Li Boqiu believes that the United Front policy should be further promoted in the future. There has been insufficient publicity for this policy in the past, and many people do not understand the work of the democratic parties. For example, the late vice chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Peng Zemin, went to a village in Guangdong to visit a family member of a martyr. Afterwards, the local village cadre asked the family member of the martyr, why are you dealing with people from the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party? When I went to Sichuan to comfort the troops in 1954, someone introduced me as a member of a democratic party, and the local people almost did not treat me as a member of the condolence delegation. Later, I had to ask them not to introduce me as a member of a democratic party when introducing me in the future, but to introduce my government position.

    Li Boqiu also hopes that the National Committee of the CPPCC and the central and local health authorities will strengthen contact with the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He said: An important task of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is to help unite traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and help improve the level of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. We cooperate very well with the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Medical Association, but we cannot get in touch with the medical and health group of the CPPCC National Committee. Li Boqiu believes that the CPPCC does not pay enough attention to party activities and has not played the highest role of the United Front. Regarding the relationship between the United Front Work Department and the various democratic parties, Li Boqiu believes that the achievements of the United Front Work Department in the past should be affirmed as the main thing. However, the situation is different today, and the internal relations of the United Front have changed. The past working methods should be changed and replaced with new working methods, and more assistance should be provided to the democratic parties in terms of political ideology and working methods. The issue of complete equality and independence between the Communist Party and the democratic parties has not yet been resolved. Some people emphasize accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and conducting ideological reform; others say that the past practices were all wrong and that independence, freedom, and equality should be emphasized now, and they are unwilling to accept leadership. Li Boqiu believes that although these two opinions form a contradiction, they can be resolved through discussion. We must accept the leadership of the Communist Party and embody our own political opinions in an expanded democratic life, continue to carry out ideological reform, and give better play to the role of the democratic parties. Li Boqiu finally hopes that the United Front Work Department will care about and cultivate their general cadres.

    Zhang Xiruo said
    Boasting, Low Knowledge Level, Insufficient Experience, and Too Many and Tight Tasks Are the Roots of the Three Major Malpractices
    Zhang Xiruo said, what I want to talk about is a special issue, which is the source of the three major malpractices to be rectified in the rectification campaign, namely, bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. First, let's talk about subjectivism. Party members study theory better than non-Party members, and they also have more contact with reality. Why is there still so much subjectivism? My analysis is: ? Many Party members have a knowledge level that is too low and does not meet the level required for the work they are currently undertaking. This is certainly not to say that everything is not up to par, but the level of knowledge required to fight against nature and build a socialist society. The level of knowledge of many Communist Party members in this regard is indeed too low; ? Insufficient experience. There is experience, but unfortunately, the situation is changing rapidly, the working conditions have changed, and the old experience is often not applicable; ? The situation is too complicated and there are too many contradictions. According to their low level and insufficient experience, coping with such an environment increases the difficulties and makes subjectivism even more difficult to avoid; ? Too many and too tight tasks. Under these circumstances, what should we do? Some cadres rely on their own experience, understanding, and talent to figure it out. This figuring out leads to subjectivism.

    Next, Zhang Xiruo talked about his analysis of bureaucracy. He said, given the background of the above-mentioned generation of subjectivism, cadres have to complete tasks, and they have to complete them ahead of schedule and exceed the quota. What should they do? In practice, he found that administrative orders are a "good" way. There are several types of bureaucracy: hard-working bureaucracy, which is preoccupation with routine matters and does not focus on principles and policies. This kind of bureaucracy is certainly not good, but I think "its ambition is commendable" and is better than not working hard. Another type is sloppy bureaucracy, which also has two situations: one is that he has no choice but to be sloppy; the other is "full all day long, doing nothing," which is even more unacceptable.

    Sectarianism is directed towards non-Party members on the one hand and towards the masses on the other. Towards non-Party members, it has its historical background in the past eight years. Some Party members believe that "the world was conquered by our family," so they consider themselves the best in the world and consider themselves revolutionary heroes. They think: "It's enough to give you a bowl of rice to eat and a position to hold. Everything is just for the sake of unity. It's not that you really have any ability." Therefore, he does things according to his own way, precisely "when power is in hand, one gives orders." Some Party members treat the masses in such a way that they only consult and cooperate when they have to. Otherwise, they take out Confucius's philosophy of "the people can be made to follow it, but they cannot be made to understand it" to use. Over time, this leads to detachment from the masses.

    Zhang Xiruo said that in addition to the above three -isms, there is also dogmatism. Some people have a low level of knowledge and insufficient experience. In order to solve problems, they can't think of a way, so they move out dogma, move out Soviet experience, and rely on dogma to solve problems. For some Party members, dogma has become the only blueprint for them to do things. Many of the Ministry of Education's work has not been done well, and the harm of dogmatism is really "great, great."

    For the source of these several -isms, I summarize that it is because: many Party members are self-important because of their achievements; their knowledge level is low, their experience is insufficient, and their old experience cannot be used; and the tasks are too many and too tight, and there is no way. As a result, they have no choice but to rely on the three major -isms to do things. First, arm yourself with dogmatism, then execute dogma with administrative orders, and protect dogma with sectarianism.

    Zhang Xiruo also said that the help of people outside the Party is also very important and can play a role. However, if you want to help well and coexist well, the democratic parties also need to continuously improve their own level. Otherwise, if you can't keep up, and you're always falling behind, how can you supervise and help? The ancients said, "He who cannot correct himself cannot correct others."

    Yuan Hanqing said
    The United Front Work Department Cannot Provide Specific Assistance to Various Democratic Parties Based on Different Characteristics
    Yuan Hanqing said that Liu Shaoqi talked about the democratic parties should play three roles for its members and the masses it is contacting in the Communist Party's "Eighth National Congress" report, namely: representing, contacting, and helping transform. The Jiusan Society has not done enough in these three areas, but it has done some in contacting and helping transform. How to represent the interests and demands of its members has been done very little. If a party cannot represent the reasonable demands of its members, the role it plays is greatly insufficient. The Jiusan Society itself is responsible for this, but the reminder from the United Front Work Department is also not enough. Today, the state's requirements for intellectuals and the intellectuals' own requirements are basically the same. The intellectuals mainly require to be able to exert their strength. Some of the requirements in this regard are reasonable, but the democratic parties cannot represent and support these requirements. Recently, the medical and health community has such a reflection: "Doctors have one foot in the hospital and one foot in the court." "There are only bad doctors, no bad patients." When dealing with such right and wrong issues, democratic parties often place responsibility on their own members. This makes the members of the democratic parties feel that the organization is not backing them up. Also, the general understanding of "representation" is only to consider the political status of the members of the democratic parties. In fact, what intellectuals require is reasonable working conditions and systems, not status.

    The United Front Work Department's view of the various democratic parties is somewhat generalized, and it does not have a deep understanding of the characteristics of the various democratic parties. Therefore, it cannot provide in-depth and specific assistance based on different characteristics and requirements.

    Recently, many members of democratic parties have reflected that they have too many concurrent positions. Quite a few people in the Jiusan Society also have too many concurrent positions. Can the democratic parties have the right to help its members reduce concurrent work?

    In addition to the above issues, Yuan Hanqing raised different views on the issue that everyone has reflected in the past few days that the cadres of the democratic parties are not at ease in their work, and on the view that the democratic parties are "protracting life with illness." He said that working in the organs of the democratic parties, some comrades in the Jiusan Society think it is very interesting and very interesting. It is not that all the cadres are not at ease in their work. On the one hand, it is necessary for the democratic parties to conduct education themselves, and on the other hand, it is necessary to create public opinion. Can the People's Daily write some editorials saying that it is important to do the work of the democratic parties and to do the work of people? We can also write about the issue of "democratic parties should represent the reasonable demands of its members." He also said that for the issue of "protracting life with illness," my experience is not so. The democratic parties are precisely in a period of youth and strength. For example, the members of the Jiusan Society increased fivefold last year. How can it be said that they are "protracting life with illness"? Especially if you go down to see, the branches in the provinces are very energetic. Therefore, I say that these four words do not conform to the overall situation.

    Wu Yan said
    Unite at the Top and Unite at the Bottom for Intellectuals, Excavate the Top Scholars Among Primary and Secondary School Teachers
    When talking about the issue of having position, power, and responsibility, Wu Yan said in a written statement: There is also the issue of being qualified and unqualified here. If you are qualified, you should naturally have power. If you are not qualified, you have no choice but to have no power or responsibility. However, I think that if you are not qualified, you should not let him have a position. If you are not qualified and let him have a position, and you don't give him power, or you give him power, and he can't control it, these are not good. Another situation is that some people who were originally qualified, if they get used to having no power or responsibility, once they give him power and ask him to be responsible, I am afraid that like bound feet that have been bound for a long time, once they are released, they cannot move forward as vigorously as natural feet. How to solve this contradiction? Wu Yan believes that it is best to adjust the position. If he can be the protagonist, let him be the protagonist. Otherwise, let him run the show or simply not let him on stage. If some democrats have some effect at home and abroad and must be given special care, I think this made sense in the early days of liberation. However, now that liberation has been going on for a long time, many talented people who have always been unknown have already emerged on the stage and are known at home or abroad. There is no need to put those little feet on stage to dance Jia Guan anymore. In short, in principle, democrats and Party members should be treated equally. Whoever is qualified should have power and responsibility. Whoever is unqualified or unable to take charge and be responsible should have no position. Otherwise, democrats will be given preferential treatment, which will inevitably make people feel uneasy and even feel unequal.

    Regarding the issue of uniting at the top and uniting at the bottom, Wu Yan believes that: uniting at the top and uniting representative figures is of course correct. How can we unite all five million intellectuals? In warfare, we must "capture the enemy, first capture the king." In the United Front, we must "unite at the bottom, first unite at the top." This is a certain truth. However, we must pay attention to the fact that there are top scholars in every profession. If we unite the top scholars in each profession, do not regard the top scholars in other professions as the top scholars in this profession. For example, primary and secondary school teachers and general intellectuals also have top scholars. If we regard university professors and senior intellectuals as their top scholars, we will be putting the wrong hat on the wrong head, and they will have opinions. Therefore, I advocate that for primary and secondary school teachers and general intellectuals, we should excavate their top scholars and unite their top scholars. In the past, the People's Congress and the CPPCC united some of them, but they united too few. Especially in rural areas, not only did they not unite, but even because district and township cadres were uneducated and did not understand the policy of intellectuals and the United Front policy, they were still going in the opposite direction, discriminating against and attacking them. Therefore, in the future, we must carry out propaganda and education work for district and township cadres and change the situation.

    Regarding the issue of personnel arrangements, Wu Yan criticized the bureaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism of the personnel departments. He believes that many problems are caused by the existence of these malpractices in the personnel departments. Personnel work is difficult to do and cannot be done carelessly, but some personnel departments do it very poorly. For example, they assign English literature experts to work as ordinary librarians, and those who study aeronautical engineering to work as ticket sellers in automobile companies... Some people call it "randomly pairing mandarin ducks," which is completely bureaucracy. They also emphasize obeying the assignment, disregarding local conditions and customs, and marital relations; they emphasize that cadres should be cultivated in their positions, but they don't know that some cadres who are too hopeless are difficult to train into talents even after many years of cultivation, and they also delay the work of the organs. This is dogmatism. Because these -isms exist in the personnel departments, personnel arrangements are often improper, which seriously hinders the work of the United Front. In order to do a good job in the United Front in the future, we must first do a good job in personnel work. To do a good job in personnel work, it is necessary to rectify the personnel departments.

    在统战部召开的座谈会上民主党派负责人继续提出意见
    批评统战部对各民主党派帮助不够
    本报讯　中共中央统战部召开的各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士座谈会，13日下午继续举行。在会上发言的有：中国农工民主党中央执行局委员严信民，九三学社中央委员王之相，中国农工民主党中央执行局委员李伯球，无党派民主人士张奚若，九三学社中央委员袁翰青。另外，中国民主促进会中央常务委员吴研因作了书面发言。
    严信民说
    大多数党员歧视民主党派谈不到同共产党真正平等
    严信民首先发言说，“长期共存，互相监督”方针的提出，就是解决共产党和民主党派平等的问题。因为“共存”和“互相”就有平等的意思，只有居于平等地位，才有当家作主的感觉，才有责任感，才能发挥积极性，好面子的知识分子尤其如此。看起来，现在民主党派同共产党只是在政治、法律上的平等，离事实上的真正的平等还遥远得很，因为事实上平等的条件还不存在，还没有物质基础。平等的权利是宣布了，民主党派却没有资格去享受这项权利。
    尽管民主党派内部有进步也有落后，但在社会上，在机关、学校，甚至大多数共产党员（更不要说青年团员），都认为民主党派落后，都瞧不起，处处歧视。比如我吧，我是农工民主党的负责人之一，但几年来我从未介绍过一个党员，也从未在机关里提过农工民主党，苦楚可见。当然，民主党派本身有政治思想性不强、组织不健全、干部条件差等弱点，可是它代表性大，高级知识分子多，做这些人的工作很重要。
    总的说来，共产党是强大进步的，民主党派是弱小落后的，在这种情况下谈平等是很困难的。当然，并不要求一切和共产党平等，也不应该这样要求。但现在“长期共存，互相监督”方针提出来了，民主党派要担负一部分政治任务，总得像个样子。否则，不但任务完不成，而且共存也共存不下去。过去统战部对民主党派帮助不少，但在事务上的帮助多，对民主人士上层人物照顾多，对思想上政治上关心少。而且统战工作的面很窄，只听少数人的话，多数人的话很少听。如我自己思想就不够开展，有问题也有意见，但统战部从未单独和我谈过，只有一次李部长和我谈过一下民委的工作，其他个别交谈思想情况就没有了。我个人曾向徐冰、于刚、汪锋等同志要求过个别谈谈，当时他们都答应了，但以后就没有下文。
    对于民主党派的工作，希望从中央到地方的统战部门都多关心一些，及时帮助解决问题，不要怕“干涉内政”，不要过分强调“独立、自由、平等”，而要多帮助。我觉得今天多帮助，就可以为以后大放手、少帮助创造条件。当然接受帮助是自愿的，谁不愿意也无强制之理。
    应该尽可能地多给民主党派一些本钱，有关理论、政策、时事的文件、党内学习参考资料，也给民主党派一些。还要多给些机会参加些报告会等，以帮助民主党派人士提高政治思想水平。过去有些活动民主党派也参加了，但人数总是限制得很少，如前不久共产党中央召开的宣传工作会议，农工民主党中央就没有一个人参加，而我们有的地方组织的负责人倒参加了。
    各民主党派是否能够和它工作对象的单位建立经常性联系（如农工民主党就可以和文教、卫生部门），多参加一些有关的会议，得到一些有关业务部门的政策、思想问题的有关资料，以便利各民主党派的工作。这个问题希望有关部门也能当做政治任务看。
    王之相说
    统战部要加强同各民主党派的联系
    王之相在发言中，首先提出了加强联系问题，他认为过去统战部和各民主党派、各民主党派相互之间的联系都很不够。譬如，拿最近比较大的问题——整风来说，自从党中央颁布了有关整风的指示以后，我们九三学社的干部问我：我们是否要整风？我说：这个问题要看领导上的指示。他认为像这样比较重大的问题，共产党和各民主党派事先应该有联系。如何联系呢？王之相认为：这次会上决定恢复双周座谈会，很好，今后类似这一类的问题可以通过双周座谈会联系。王之相还表示赞成建立经常性的党派工作座谈会等制度，他并且希望各省市如有条件也可以这样做。
    王之相还说：现在很希望领导党要从政治思想上、组织上多加帮助。
    王之相还提出了九三学社中央机关干部非常困难，编制不足，尤其是组织发展了两倍，干部还是照旧，希望统战部和国务院人事局联系，帮助我们解决。
    李伯球说
    党员有特权思想政协忽视党派工作
    李伯球在谈到有职无权问题时，认为：非党干部在负责岗位上为什么会有职无权呢？往往是因为党的领导和行政领导有矛盾。为什么会发生党的领导和行政领导矛盾的问题呢？一般说来，是因为党员中存在宗派主义思想，如果说宗派主义产生在阶级感情上，不同的阶级出身带来不同的阶级感情，共产党员长期向敌人作斗争，因而有这种宗派主义情绪是可以理解的。这种情绪经过长期合作共事、互相了解增加了，是可以克服的。但是，李伯球认为：另一更重要的原因是：有些共产党员的特权思想。这种特权思想是过去反动统治阶级的思想。党中央教育党员要“吃苦在前，享乐在后”，“共产党员要解放全人类，没有特殊权利，只有更多的义务”，可是，许多党员忘记了党这种教育，机械的用阶级斗争的原则，来掩护他的特权思想；靠着党和党中央、毛主席在人民群众中崇高的威信来行使自己的特权。这样问题就严重了。他还举了这样的例子：天津有一个医院副院长是共产党员，院长是非党员，副院长常常自己决定问题，非党院长批评他，未经大家讨论，他还说：有什么事，我负责任好了。非党院长说：“这样要我干什么”。李伯球认为：这主要因为这位党员不尊重集体领导，特权思想在作怪，这正是宗派主义的最具体的表现。因此，他说：要能做到非党人士有职有权，除建立一些制度保证具体领导以外，还必须在这次整风中整掉这些特权思想。
    李伯球认为今后要进一步宣传统一战线政策，过去对这一政策宣传不够，许多人不了解民主党派的工作。如有一次已故农工民主党副主席彭泽民到广东乡下去看望一位烈属，事后，当地乡干部还问这位烈属，你为什么同农工民主党的人往来？我在1954年往四川劳军，有人介绍了我是民主党派，当地的人差一点不把我当慰问团的团员看待，后来，我只得请以后介绍我时，不要介绍我是民主党派，介绍我的政府职务好了。
    李伯球还希望政协全国委员会和中央、地方的卫生机关加强和农工民主党的联系。他说：农工民主党很重要的一项任务是：帮助中西医的团结，帮助中西医提高水平。我们同卫生部、中华医学会合作得很好，但是，同政协全国委员会的医药卫生组取不上联系。李伯球认为，政协最不重视党派活动，没有发挥统一战线的最高作用了。关于统战部和各民主党派的关系问题，李伯球认为：过去统战部的工作应该肯定成绩是主要的，但是，今天情况不同了，统战内部关系变了，应该改变过去的工作方法，代之以新的工作方法，对民主党派多从政治思想上和工作方法上多进行帮助。现在共产党和民主党派完全平等、独立的问题还没有解决，有人强调接受共产党的领导，进行思想改造；有人说：过去的作法都错了，现在应该强调独立、自由、平等，不愿接受领导。李伯球认为：这两种意见虽然形成矛盾，但可以通过讨论加以解决。要在扩大民主生活中，来接受共产党的领导，体现自己的政治意见，继续进行思想改造，更好地发挥民主党派的作用。李伯球最后希望统战部关心和培养他们的一般干部。
    张奚若说
    居功自大、知识水平低、经验不足，任务又多又紧是三大毛病的根源
    张奚若说，我要讲的是一个特殊问题，就是关于整风要整的三大毛病，即官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的来源。首先谈谈主观主义。党员的理论学习比党外好，接触实际也多，为什么主观主义还这样多？我的分析是：?有不少党员知识水平太低，不够他现在所担负的工作所需要的水平，这当然不是指的一切都不够水平，而是跟自然界作斗争以及建设社会主义社会所需要的知识水平。而不少共产党员在这方面的知识水平确是太低；?经验不够。经验是有的，不幸的是情况变化快，工作条件变了，旧的经验常常用不上；?情况太复杂，矛盾太多，根据他们那样低的水平，不够用的经验，要应付这样的环境，就增加了更多的困难，主观主义就更难免；?任务太多、太紧。在这种情况下，究竟怎样办？有些干部就凭自己的经验、认识、天才去琢磨，这一琢磨就琢磨出个主观主义来了。
    接着，张奚若谈到他对官僚主义的分析。他说，既有上边所说产生主观主义的背景，干部要完成任务，而且要超额、提前完成，怎么办？在实践中他发现行政命令是个“好”办法。官僚主义有好几种：辛辛苦苦的官僚主义，是事务主义，不抓方针政策。这种官僚主义当然不好，但我以为“其志可嘉”，比不辛辛苦苦的好。另一种是马马虎虎的官僚主义，这当中又有两种情况，一种是他没有办法，只好马马虎虎；一种是“饱食终日，无所用心”的马马虎虎，更要不得。
    宗派主义，一方面是对党外人士，一方面是对群众。对党外人士，八年以来有其历史背景，有些党员认为“天下是咱家打的”，于是老子天下第一，以革命功臣自居。他们认为：给你一碗饭吃，给你官做就够了，一切不过是为了团结，并不是你真正有什么本事。”因此，他有事情就照他的办法办，正是“一朝权在手，便把令来行”，有些党员对群众，当非请教、合作不可时才请教、合作，不然，就拿出孔子的“民可使由之，不可使知之”的哲学来用一下。这样久而久之就脱离群众。
    张奚若说，除了上面那三个主义外，还有一个教条主义。有些人知识水平低，经验不足，为了解决问题，想不出办法，就搬教条，搬苏联经验，依靠教条解决问题。对某些党员来说，教条成了他办事的唯一蓝本。教育部许多工作没做好，教条主义之害实在是“大矣哉，大矣哉”。
    对于这几个主义的来源，我总结起来是由于：许多党员居功而自大；知识水平低，经验不够，旧经验不能用；任务又多又紧，没有办法。结果，就只好靠三大主义办事了。先拿教条主义武装起来，再拿行政命令执行教条，拿宗派主义保护教条。
    张奚若又说，党外的帮助也是很重要的，可以起些作用，但是，如果要帮助得好，共存得好，各民主党派还需要不断提高自己的水平。不然，跟都跟不上，老掉队还能监督、帮助吗？古人说“己不正而能正人者，未之有也”。
    袁翰青说
    统战部不能根据不同特点具体帮助各民主党派
    袁翰青说，刘少奇在共产党 “八大”的报告中曾谈到民主党派对他的成员和所联系的群众应该起三方面的作用，即：代表、联系、帮助改造。九三学社在这三方面都做得不够，但联系和帮助改造还做了一些，如何代表成员的利益和要求就做得很少了。作为一个党派而不能代表它的成员的合理要求，所起的作用就大大不够。这点九三学社本身要负责，但统战部的提醒也不够。今天国家对知识分子的要求和知识分子本身的要求基本上是一致的，知识分子主要是要求能够发挥自己的力量。在这方面有些要求是合理的，但民主党派不能代表和支持这些要求，最近医药卫生界有这样的反映：“做医生的一只脚在医院，一只脚在法院”“只有不是的医生，没有不是的病人”。民主党派在处理这类是非问题的时候，也常常把责任放在自己的成员身上。这就不能使民主党派成员感到组织没有给他撑腰。还有，一般人对“代表”的看法，仅仅理解为是要考虑民主党派成员的政治地位，实际上知识分子要求的是合理的工作条件和制度，而不是地位。
    统战部对各民主党派的看法有些一般化，对各民主党派的特点了解不深，因此，不能根据不同的特点和要求进行深入具体的帮助。
    近来，民主党派成员反映兼职过多的颇不少，九三学社中也有相当多的人兼职过多。民主党派是否可以有权帮助它的成员减少兼职工作？
    除了以上问题以外，袁翰青对这几天大家反映民主党派的干部不安心工作的问题，和认为民主党派是“带病延年”的问题，提出了不同的看法。他说，在民主党派机关中做工作，九三学社有些同志就认为很有意思，很有兴趣，并不是所有的干部都不安心工作。这个问题，一方面要靠各民主党派自己进行教育，一方面要造成社会舆论，人民日报能不能写点社论，说做民主党派工作、做人的工作很重要。也可以写写“民主党派应当代表他的成员反映合理要求”的问题。他又说，对于“带病延年”的问题，我的体味不是如此，各民主党派正是青壮有为的时期。比如九三学社社员去年就增加了五倍，怎么能说是“带病延年”？尤其到下面看看，各省的分支机构劲头大得很。因此，我说，这四个字不符合全面情况。
    吴研因说
    对知识分子统上也要统下发掘中小学教师中的状元
    吴研因在书面发言中谈到有职、有权、有责的问题时提出：这里面也有称职和不称职的问题存在。如果称职，自然应该有权，如果不称职，那就只好无权无责了。不过，我认为不称职就不应该让他有职，如果不称职又让他有职，又不把权交给他，或者把权交给他，他也掌握不了，这都是不好的。另一种情况，有些本来还称职的人，如果无权无责成了习惯，一旦把权交给他，要他负责，怕也好像缠久了的小脚，一旦开放，也不能像天足一样大踏步前进。如何解决这个矛盾呢？吴研因认为最好把职调整一下，能做主角的，就让他做主角，否则就让他跑龙套或者干脆不要他在台上。如果说，有些民主人士，对国内和国际有些作用，不能不特别照顾，我认为这在解放初期是说得通的。但是，现在解放已久，有许多向来无名的人才，已经在台上显露头角，为国内或者国际所知名了，用不着再把那些小脚放在台上跳加官。总而言之，原则上民主人士和党员应该平等待遇，不论是谁，称职的就让他有权有责，不称职或者不能掌权负责的，就让他无职。否则民主人士被优待，总不免令人不安心，甚至有不平等的感觉。
    关于统上和统下的问题，吴研因认为：统上，统代表性人物，当然是对的，五百万知识分子，怎么能个个去统呢？作战要“擒贼先擒王”，统战要“统下先统上”，这是一定的道理。但是，要注意行行有状元，把各行的状元统起来，不要把别行的状元当这行的状元来统。例如中小学教师和一般知识分子，他们也有状元，如果把大学教授和高级知识分子当他们的状元，就是张冠李戴，他们是会有意见的。因此，我主张对中小学教师和一般知识分子，要发掘他们的状元，把他们的状元统起来，过去人民代表大会和政协是统了一些的，但是，统得太少了。尤其是在农村的，不但没有去统，甚至由于区、乡干部没有文化，不了解知识分子的政策和统一战线政策，还在走相反的路，歧视、打击他们。因此，今后必须对区、乡干部做宣传教育工作，把情况改变过来。
    关于人事安排问题，吴研因批评了人事部门的官僚主义、教条主义和宗派主义。他认为许多问题都是由于人事部门存在这些毛病而引起的。人事工作很难做，不能粗枝大叶，但是有些人事部门却做得很不好，例如把英文文学专家，分配去做普通图书馆员，把学航空工程的，分配去当汽车公司售票员……有人称它为“乱点鸳鸯”，真是十足的官僚主义，他们还强调服从分配，不顾风土人情，夫妻关系；强调干部要在岗位上培养，不知道有些太不成话的干部，培养了好多年也难成材，并且，还耽误了机关工作，这就是教条主义。因为人事部门存在这些主义，所以往往由于人事安排不当，严重妨碍了统战工作。今后要做好统战工作，首先要做好人事工作。要做好人事工作，对人事部门整一下风是必要的。
