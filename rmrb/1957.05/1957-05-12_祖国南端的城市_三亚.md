    The City at the Southern Tip of the Motherland – Sanya

    Sanya City, located in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture at the southern tip of the motherland, is becoming increasingly prosperous.

    State-owned and local state-owned factories and commercial institutions are being built. Trucks are constantly transporting goods on the highway, bringing large quantities of rattan, white rattan, kapok, wild hemp, coconut oil, betel nuts, and various animal skins from counties in the Wuzhi Mountain area every day. From here, they are transported by sea to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, and other places. At the same time, daily industrial products, new farm tools, medicines, and other items transported from all over the motherland are transported to various counties in the autonomous prefecture. In the evening, fishing boats returning from the South China Sea and the Beibu Gulf fishing grounds gather in large numbers in Sanya Port. After the fish are processed here, they are sold to all parts of the motherland.

    Sanya City faces the Nanyang Islands and backs the Wuzhi Mountain area, which has a mild climate and is like spring all year round. On land, it can directly connect with various cities in Hainan. Through sea transportation, it can not only sail to major coastal cities in the motherland but also travel to Southeast Asian countries in the Pacific Ocean. It is located on the coast of the South China Sea and is not only famous for producing fish and salt but also produces large quantities of coconuts and seafood such as coral and shells. However, more than ten years ago, when the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan Island, this city became an advance base for Japanese fascist bandits to attack the people of Southeast Asian countries. At that time, the Japanese fascist bandits drove away the residents of Sanya City, demolished and burned their houses, established various military camps, fortresses, gunpowder depots, and secret agent agencies, and opened up an amphibious military airport. After the Japanese fascists surrendered in 1945, American imperialism wanted to establish a base here and follow the path of the Japanese fascists. The US imperialist Pacific Fleet frequently patrolled here, and the planes of the imperialist element Chennault also occupied the airport in the Sanya area. However, these imperialist snouts that stretched into our motherland’s garden were finally cut off by the powerful forces of the people.

    After liberation, this city began peaceful construction. The people's government led the residents here to open up and renovate salt fields on a large scale. The annual salt production was less than 200,000 dan at the beginning of liberation, but now it has increased to more than 600,000 dan. The people's government has adopted methods such as loans and relief to support fishermen in developing production and help them establish fishing production cooperatives. At the beginning of liberation, the annual output of marine fish here was only more than 20,000 dan, but now it has increased to more than 120,000 dan. The number of fishing boats has also increased from 200 to more than 600.

    The transportation industry has also developed. At the beginning of liberation, due to the destruction caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries before their escape, sea transportation was almost blocked, and there were not frequent vehicles traveling on the land route between Sanya and Haikou, a major city in Hainan. Now, there are regular freighters, and there are three or four buses directly to Haikou every day, and there are also buses to and from the highways to various counties. Public buses also run frequently in the urban area.

    On the ruins of the reactionaries' military camps and fortresses, factories for oil pressing, soap making, power generation, brick and tile lime, and printing have been established, as well as various commercial institutions, hospitals, banks, workers' clubs, automobile transportation stations, workers' sanatoriums, cultural centers, cinemas, theaters, and middle schools.... The number of students has also increased from more than 200 in the early days of liberation to more than 1,000.

    According to Sanya City's construction blueprint, it will be built into a new type of commercial port for trade with Southeast Asian countries. By that time, Sanya City will be even more lively than it is now.

### 祖国南端的城市——三亚

    祖国南端的城市——三亚
    位于祖国南端海南黎族苗族自治州的三亚市，越来越繁荣了。
    一座座国营和地方国营的工厂、商业机构，正在兴建起来。公路上川流不息的运货汽车，每天都从五指山区各县运来大批红藤、白藤、木棉、野山麻、椰油、槟榔和各种兽皮，然后从这里经海路运销到广州、上海、青岛、天津、北京、内蒙古等地，同时又把由祖国各地运来的日用工业品、新式农具、药械等运到自治州各县去。傍晚，从南海滨和北部湾渔场捕鱼归来的渔船，成群结队地密集在三亚港。鱼货在这里加工以后，运销到祖国各地。
    三亚市面对着南洋群岛，背靠着气候温和四季如春的五指山区。陆地上它能同海南各个城市直接联系，通过海运，它不仅可以同祖国沿海各大城市通航，还可以同太平洋上的东南亚国家来往。它位处南海之滨，不但以出产鱼、盐著名，而且还出产大宗的椰子和珊瑚、贝壳等海产品。可是，十多年前，当日寇占领海南岛的时候，这座城市竟成为日本法西斯强盗进攻东南亚各国人民的前进基地。那时候，日本法西斯强盗赶跑了三亚市的居民，拆毁和烧掉了居民们的房屋，建立起各种军营、堡垒、火药库和特务间谍机关，并且开辟了水陆两栖的军用飞机场。1945年日本法西斯投降以后，美帝国主义又想在这里建立基地，走日本法西斯的道路。美帝国主义的太平洋舰队经常在这里巡视，帝国主义分子陈纳德的飞机也霸占了三亚地区的飞机场。但是，这些伸到我们祖国花园来的帝国主义的猪嘴，终于被强大的人民力量斩断了。
    解放以后，这座城市开始了和平建设。人民政府领导这里的居民大规模地开辟和修整了晒盐场地。盐的年产量，在刚解放的时候不到二十万担，现在已经增加到六十多万担。人民政府采取贷款救济等办法，扶助渔民发展生产，帮助渔民建立渔业生产合作社。解放初期，这里海鱼的年产量仅有二万多担，现在增加到十二万担以上。渔船也由二百艘增加到六百多艘。
    交通运输事业也发展起来了。解放初期，由于国民党反动派逃跑前的破坏，海运几乎闭塞，陆路在同三亚与海南大城市海口之间也不是经常有车辆来往。现在，有了定期的货轮，每天有三、四次直达海口的班车，到各县的公路上也有班车来往。市区里更经常行驶着公共汽车。
    在反动派的军营、堡垒的废墟上，建立起了榨油、肥皂、发电、砖瓦石灰、印刷等工厂，建立了各种商业机构、医院、银行、工人俱乐部、汽车运输站、工人疗养所、文化馆、电影院、剧院和中学……。学生人数也由解放初期的二百多人，增加到一千多人。
    根据三亚市的建设蓝图，这里将建成一个新型的商港，对东南亚国家开展贸易。到那时候，三亚市将比现在更加热闹了。	延昭
