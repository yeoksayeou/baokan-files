Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League continued its plenary session on the afternoon of the 16th. The congress began its general assembly speeches today.

Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the Credentials Committee, delivered a report on the review of delegate credentials to the congress. The congress unanimously approved the report.

The congress warmly welcomed Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

After a break, youth representatives from the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Romania, and Bulgaria delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting and presented flags and gifts to the congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

Seven representatives spoke at the meeting today, focusing on how to address the internal contradictions among youth and the participation of youth in agricultural production.

Li Qitao, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that because young people are mostly in a position of being led, are young, lack experience, are prone to one-sidedness in viewing problems, and lack class struggle training, internal contradictions among the people are more prominently exposed among young people. He also said that because young people are keen, straightforward, full of ideals, dare to accept the truth, have unlimited trust in the Party, and support the socialist future, they are still an active force in resolving internal contradictions among the people.

Li Xing, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, reported to the congress on the situation in Hebei Province regarding the participation of middle and primary school graduates in agricultural production. He said that many contradictions have arisen on this issue. Based on the working experience of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, he pointed out that to solve this problem, it is necessary first to educate middle and primary school students to prepare for both further education and employment.

Zhang Shuguang, Minister of the Youth and Agriculture Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said in his speech that the Communist Youth League should further educate rural youth to establish the idea of "loving the cooperative as their home" so that the cooperative can be run well.

Liu Xiaosan, a representative from the Xincheng Youth Farm in Yunnan Province, on the bank of the Nu River in Yunnan Province, reported to the congress on the vivid story of how their youth reclamation team overcame various difficulties and started a business diligently and thriftily.

Wang Zhanxian, Deputy Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Gude Xiangqian, Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, respectively spoke about how the Communist Youth League should strengthen the education of ethnic policies and ethnic unity for young people of all ethnic groups, and strengthen the work of the Communist Youth League in ethnic minority areas. Wang Longyi, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, focused on how they carried out work according to the characteristics of young people under the leadership of the Party, and how to resolve the contradictions between young workers and old workers.

During the congress, a symbolic long-distance running team of twenty-four people from Beijing Industrial School entered the venue to congratulate the congress.
