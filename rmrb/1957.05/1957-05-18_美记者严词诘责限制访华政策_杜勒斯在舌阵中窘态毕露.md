Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 15th: US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on May 14th that he was prepared to make a "not entirely logical" decision regarding the issue of American journalists visiting China.

He said that the State Department does not allow American journalists to come to China for news interviews with American passports because China is still detaining Americans; but he also said that the government is studying allowing some American journalists to come to China under a restricted policy.

Dulles's self-contradictory remarks were made under a barrage of questions at the press conference. American journalists expressed great dissatisfaction with the State Department's lack of freedom for them to cover news in China.

At this press conference, reporters questioned Dulles about his statement that the freedom of the press stipulated in the US Constitution only refers to freedom of publication and not freedom of interviewing. Does this mean that the American press can only interview foreign news with the permission of the State Department, because passports are controlled by Dulles, is this interpretation correct?

Dulles replied: This interpretation is not correct, but he is also "a little unsure" about the legal scope of the entire passport issue, which should be decided by the court.

Some reporters, while pressing Dulles, said that the American approach is to use journalists as a tool of American foreign policy, "equivalent to using reporters as a weapon to force the Chinese communists to do what we want."

Dulles replied that the US government's responsibility is to protect Americans. Unless China changes its policy of "insulting and mistreating" Americans, the US government will not allow more Americans to go to China.

But he also said that the State Department "is studying" a plan to send journalists to China, "This plan has enough restrictions to make us feel that it is acceptable and in line with our foreign policy objectives."

Some reporters pointed out that the Secretary of State's attitude was self-contradictory. Dulles admitted that this approach was "not entirely logical."

    美记者严词诘责限制访华政策
    杜勒斯在舌阵中窘态毕露
    据新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在5月14日的记者招待会上说，他准备就美国记者访问中国的事情作出一个“不完全合乎逻辑”的决定。
    他说，国务院不允许美国记者拿着美国护照到中国来采访新闻，这是因为中国还拘押着美国人；但他又说，政府正在研究让一些美国记者在有限制的政策下前来中国。
    杜勒斯的这种自相矛盾的话是在招待会的连珠炮式的发问下说出来的，美国记者对于国务院不给他们采访中国新闻的自由表现了极大不满。
    记者们在这一次招待会上质问杜勒斯，他说过美国宪法规定的新闻自由只是指出版自由而不是采访自由，这种说法是不是表明美国报界只能在国务院的许可下才能采访外国消息，因为出国护照是控制在杜勒斯手里的，这种解释是否正确？
    杜勒斯回答说：这种解释不正确，不过他也“有些拿不稳”整个护照问题的法律范围，这要法院来决定。
    一些记者在追问杜勒斯时说，美国的做法是把新闻记者作为美国外交政策的一种工具，“等于要把记者作为强迫共产党中国人按照我们所要的去做的一种武器”。
    杜勒斯回答说，美国政府的责任是保护美国人，除非中国改变“侮辱和虐待”美国人的政策，否则美国政府不让更多的美国人到中国去。
    但是他又说，国务院“正在研究”一个派新闻记者去中国的计划，“这个计划有足够的限制，使我们觉得它符合我们的外交政策目标而可以接受”。
    有记者指出国务卿的这种态度是自相矛盾的。杜勒斯承认这种做法是并“不完全合乎逻辑”的。
