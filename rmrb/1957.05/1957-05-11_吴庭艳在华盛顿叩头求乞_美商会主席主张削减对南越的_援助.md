Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: Since arriving in Washington on the 8th, Ngô Đình Diệm has held continuous talks with US government leaders to discuss US aid to South Vietnam and the strengthening of South Vietnam as a US base of aggression in Southeast Asia.

In various situations in Washington, Ngô Đình Diệm is trying his best to demonstrate his anti-communist resolve and emphasizes the importance of South Vietnam's position in carrying out anti-communist activities in the Southeast Asian region, in order to illustrate the necessity for the United States to increase its aid to South Vietnam.

According to an announcement by the US International Cooperation Administration, by the end of the 1957 fiscal year (June 30, 1957), the US economic and technical assistance to South Vietnam will total more than 750 million US dollars. This amount does not include the cost of military materials and military training provided to South Vietnam by the US Department of Defense under the Mutual Security Act.

According to news continuously transmitted by American news agencies, the United States does not intend to increase the aid to Ngô Đình Diệm much from the current amount of approximately 280 million US dollars per year. Johnston, chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce Council, recently conducted an on-the-spot investigation in Southeast Asia and submitted a report to the US Congress, advocating reducing aid to South Vietnam. This report expressed dissatisfaction with the chaotic financial situation in South Vietnam and its impact on the effectiveness of US aid. The report also pointed out that, with US military assistance, the South Vietnamese "armed forces are so large in scale and so heavily equipped that they exceed the needs of domestic security." The report believes that as long as South Vietnam is "protected" by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it does not need to have an excessively large military establishment.

    吴庭艳在华盛顿叩头求乞
    美商会主席主张削减对南越的“援助”
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：吴庭艳在8日到达华盛顿以后，连日同美国政府首脑举行会谈，讨论美国对南越的援助和加强南越作为美国在东南亚的侵略基地的问题。
    吴庭艳在华盛顿的各种场合尽量表明自己的反共决心，并且强调南越在东南亚地区进行反共活动的地位重要，来说明美国增加对南越的援助的必要性。
    据美国国际合作署宣布，到1957财政年度结束时（1957年6月30日）为止的三年中，美国对南越的经济和技术援助将共达七亿五千万美元以上。这笔款项中还不包括美国国防部根据共同安全法拨付的经费向南越提供的军事物资和军事训练的费用。
    据美国通讯社不断传出的消息，美国不打算把对吴庭艳的援助从目前的每年大约两亿八千万美元的数目增加多少。美国商会理事会主席约翰斯顿最近到东南亚进行了实地考察以后，向美国国会提出了一个报告，主张削减对南越的援助。这个报告对南越财政情况混乱并且影响到美援的效用表示不满。报告并且指出，在美国的军事援助下，南越“武装部队规模之大，装备之重，超过了国内治安需要的程度”。报告认为，只要南越受到东南亚条约组织的“保护”，它就用不着拥有过于庞大的军事编制。
