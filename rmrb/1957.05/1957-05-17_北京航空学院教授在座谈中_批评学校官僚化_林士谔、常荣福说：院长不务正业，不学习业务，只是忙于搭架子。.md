Professors Lin Shi'e, Chang Rongfu said: The dean neglects his duties, does not study professional work, and is only busy building frameworks.

(Our newspaper reports) On the afternoon of the 16th, the Beijing Aviation Institute Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a symposium of all professors. Fifty-five professors and associate professors participated in the symposium. In order to help the institute party committee rectify its work style, improve leadership, and run the aviation institute well, everyone earnestly criticized the shortcomings and errors existing in the leadership of the institute party committee in the past.

Many professors believed in their speeches that, due to the institute party committee's failure to promote democracy over the past few years, everyone dared not speak freely. Professor Cui Jiya said: Although the channels of speech have been opened recently, my concerns about speaking have not been completely eliminated. Will there be perpetual immunity no matter what I say this time? What if I am regarded as a spontaneous counter-revolutionary element again? The party general branch secretary of the Third Department said he could guarantee that this would not happen. However, the dean said, if you really have concerns and don't want to talk, you can leave it for later. I feel like there are still problems. Can it be guaranteed that a citizen cannot be subjected to any mass trial or mass struggle before he is proven guilty? Last time, there was a charge of 'spontaneous counter-revolutionary element' during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and this definition should be clarified. If anyone who is not connected with the US-Chiang clique attacks or opposes the leadership is mostly considered this crime, will our criticism of the leadership be labeled with this crime? Then we will not be able to get to the bottom of it. In the past, the party organization told me that they trusted me, but as soon as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries came, they asked me why I didn't go to Taiwan and whether I had any organizational relations with the Kuomintang. My concerns have not been eliminated. But I have also found some guarantees, such as the party's political prestige is the biggest guarantee, and there will be no 'tightening up' after 'loosening up' now. Although the suppression of counter-revolutionaries did not find any problems with me, after the suppression, the label of backwardness stuck to you like a ghost. It was useless to be active, and the leadership would say you were doing it for personal gain and backward. In this situation, we dare not speak, as silent as cicadas in winter. Although I have concerns about 'loosening up' now, the problem must be raised, as I am already feeling suffocated, and I can't worry about so much. I will let go first and deal with the future later.

Professor Ning Huang said: Everyone has a common concern, which is fear of being caught out on minor issues and fear of being labeled with big hats. People have perceptual knowledge. In the past, we were afraid that someone would be listening in the corners when we talked, and what we said at meetings was recorded. Over time, we forgot what we said, but others kept it in mind, fearing that it would be used to settle accounts later. We old intellectuals don't seek merit but seek to avoid faults and protect ourselves. This time, because it is rectification and party consolidation, it is estimated that we cannot take care of this concern.

Some professors revealed in their speeches that the institute party committee's leadership was bureaucratic, mainly manifested in the institute leaders not understanding or actively studying teaching business, not respecting and relying on senior intellectuals to run the school well, only keen on expanding administrative institutions, the school was bureaucratized, high above, with strict hierarchy, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses.

Professor Lin Shi'e said: We support the old cadres leading our institute. However, the old cadres cannot only lead ideologically, they should learn professional work. The dean wrote to us asking us to give them business lessons, and we arrived on time, but they were late and left early. Here, I seriously criticize the dean. You cannot run the aviation institute well if you don't study professional work. Chairman Mao asked old cadres to learn and master science and technology within ten to fifteen years, and it is wrong not to learn.

Associate Professor Chang Rongfu said: I feel that the dean neglects his duties. Our dean does not understand the business. It is impossible to run a large-scale university well without understanding the teaching business. He doesn't understand the business, and he doesn't come down to understand the situation, he is only busy building frameworks, only asking for things from below, but cannot help the subordinates solve problems.

Professor Song Yichang said that our institute's organization is bloated, the responsibilities are unclear, the personnel are transferred frequently, and there are many mistakes. For example, to establish a scientific research group, the transfer of members must be approved through many levels. Because there are many job transfers, cadres are not at ease in their work and are not familiar with the business. We wanted to invite Soviet experts who had returned from Harbin Institute of Technology, but it was delayed because the documents circulated within the institute. There are many forms filled in the institute, but there are also many places where the content is filled in incorrectly.

Associate Professor Chang Rongfu said that the dean is very busy, busy building frameworks. The frameworks of the Fourth and Third Departments have been built again, but there is no substance. Now the political atmosphere in the institute is also very thin, and few people take notes when giving reports, because there is nothing new in what is said. On the surface, it looks calm, but because there are many officials in the institute, people are divided into grades, and they only listen to one side, everyone swallows their opinions.

Professor Cui Jiya said, "The school values the section chiefs and section members, and treats teachers the same as section members. Four or five people are squeezed into one room. Only when you need to teach do you use professors. The school is an academic institution, and the academic level is measured by the level of the professor's lectures and scientific research, but the school does not respect professors and does not give play to our role."

Associate Professor Shi Chaoli said, I am an ordinary teacher. I feel that our teaching and research office director has the position but no power and cannot solve any problems. Some things are only known to party member junior lecturers and assistants. I feel that it is a loss not to be able to give full play to the director's role.

Professor Cao Jintao said that how to use senior intellectuals is a big problem in our institute. Associate Professor Pei Liejun studied in Germany for eight years and speaks six languages. After Premier Zhou made a report on the issue of intellectuals, he was transferred to work in the library, initially without a title, and later he was asked to be a team leader. And our library team leaders are generally middle school students. I have proposed several times that he be appointed as deputy curator, but it has not been resolved.

Associate Professor Li Shenglin said that in the past few years, the institute has been very disrespectful to old professors, and everyone wants to leave. There have been improvements since Dean Wu came, but he has not given full play to the role of intellectuals. The institute believes that two teachers are not good and transferred them to work in Changchun. After they arrived there, one person was able to do the work of two people. There are many aspects to helping intellectuals, the main ones are political care and trust. This is the characteristic and law of intellectuals, and the institute has not done enough research on these. To run the school well, we mainly rely on teachers. I hope the institute party committee will pay attention to doing this work."

The professors also raised many opinions on the school leadership's sectarianism. For example, when looking at materials, going to factories for internships, and assigning graduates, they only take care of party members or the children of senior cadres, while not paying enough attention to general students. Professor Cui Jiya also recited a few satirical verses when exposing the bureaucratic style of some party members.

The professors also criticized the dogmatic tendencies in learning from foreign experience in their speeches. Some professors criticized the shortcomings of blindly expanding the school departments adjustment. Professor Ning Huang said that I think there are problems of subjectivism and dogmatism in the adjustment of departments. I hope Comrade Qian Junrui, who was responsible for this work at that time, can make a review.

    北京航空学院教授在座谈中
    批评学校官僚化
    林士谔、常荣福说：院长不务正业，不学习业务，只是忙于搭架子。
    本报讯　16日下午，中共北京航空学院委员会召开全院教授座谈会。参加座谈的有教授、副教授五十五人。大家为了帮助院党委整风，改进领导，办好航空学院，对院党委在过去领导上所存在的缺点和错误认真地展开批评。
    许多教授在发言中认为，几年来由于院党委不发扬民主，大家不敢畅所欲言。教授崔济亚说：近来言路虽开，我发言的顾虑未完全消除。这次什么话都说了，是否永远无罪呢？如果再把我算作自发的反革命分子怎么办呢？三系党总支书记说能作保证，不会这样。可是院长却说，你假如有顾虑实在不谈，就留以后再谈。我觉得好像仍有问题。是否可以保证一个公民在没有证明他有罪以前，就不能进行任何群众性审判和群众性斗争呢？上次肃反有个‘自发的反革命分子’罪名，这个定义应弄清楚。如果凡是与美蒋没有联系的打击领导，反对领导，多属这个罪名，我们对领导上的批评是不是会被安上这个罪名？就打不到底了。过去党组织曾对我说信任我，可是肃反一来就问我为什么不到台湾去？与国民党有没有组织关系？我的顾虑是没消除的。但我也找到一些保证，如党的政治威信就是顶大的保证，现在谈‘放’，将来不会再‘收’，肃反虽然没有反出我什么问题，但是肃反以后，落后的帽子像鬼一样的钉住你，你积极也没用，越是积极，领导上就说你是为了个人，落后。在这情况下，我们就不敢说话，噤若寒蝉。我现在‘放’虽有顾虑，但问题不提不行，已压得难受，已顾不到那么许多，先放了将来再说。
    宁榥教授说：大家有一个共同的顾虑，就是怕抓小辫子，怕扣大帽子。人是有感性知识的，过去谈话怕墙角有人听，会上说话有记录，时间长了自己讲过的忘记了，而人家听在心里，怕算总账。我们旧知识分子，不求有功，但求无过，明哲保身。这次因为是整风整党，估计没有办法照顾到这头了。
    有些教授在发言中揭发院党委领导上的官僚主义，主要表现在院领导同志不懂也不积极钻研教学业务，不尊重和依靠高级知识分子办好学校，只热衷于扩大行政机构，学校官僚化，高高在上，等级森严，脱离实际，脱离群众。
    林士谔教授说：对老干部领导我们的学院，我们拥护。但是老干部不能仅是领导思想，应该学业务。院长曾写信给我们替他们上业务课，我们按时到了，他们却迟到早退。在这里我严肃地对院长提出批评，不学习业务是不能办好航空学院的。毛主席要求老干部在十年至十五年内学会掌握科学技术，不学是不对的。
    常荣福副教授说：我感到院长不务正业。我们院长不懂业务，办一个规模宏大的大学不懂教学业务，是没有办法办好的。既不懂业务，又不下来了解情况，只是忙于搭架子，只是向下面要东西，而不能帮助下面解决问题。
    宋懿昌教授说，我们学院的机构臃肿，职责不明，人员调动频繁，错误百出。如成立科学研究小组，调动组员要经过很多层次才能批准。因为工作调动多，使干部不安心工作，不熟悉业务。我们想请由哈尔滨工业大学回国的苏联专家，就是因文牍在院内周转而耽误了。院内填造的表册多，但内容填错的地方也很多。
    常荣福副教授说，院长很忙，忙于搭架子。四系和三系的架子又搭起来了，但没有肉。现在院内的政治空气也很稀薄，做起报告来没有几个人记笔记的，因为讲来讲去没有什么新内容。表面上看起来风平浪静，但是因为院里官多，把人分等，偏听偏信，大家把意见都咽到肚子里去了。
    崔济亚教授说，“学校重视的就是处长、科长，对教员和科员一样待遇，四、五个人挤在一室。什么时候要上课，才用得着教授。学校是学术机关，学术水平是以教授的讲学与科学研究的水平来衡量的，而学校对教授却不尊重，不发挥我们的作用。”
    史超礼副教授说，我是一个普通教师。我感到我们的教研室主任有职无权，不能解决什么问题。有些事都只让党员青年讲师、助教们知道，我觉得不能很好发挥主任的作用是一种损失。
    曹金涛教授说，对高级知识分子如何使用，在我们院里是很有问题的。裴烈君副教授留学德国八年，会六国语言。在周总理做了关于知识分子问题的报告以后，还把他调到图书馆工作，开始没有名义，以后才叫他做组长。而我们图书馆的组长一般都是中学生做的。我曾几次提议要他担任副馆长，都未得到解决。
    历声林副教授说，几年来，学院对老教授很不尊重，大家都想离开。武院长来后有改进，但是也没有很好发挥知识分子的作用。院里认为有两位先生不好，把他们调去长春工作。他们到了那里以后，一个人却能做两个人的事。对知识分子帮助有许多方面，主要的还是政治上的照顾与信任，这是知识分子的特性和规律，院方对这些研究就不够。要办好学校，主要靠教师。我希望院党委注意做好这工作。”
    对于学校领导方面的宗派主义，教授们也提了很多意见。如看资料、下工厂实习、毕业生的分配，只照顾到党员或是高级干部的子弟，而对一般学生则不够注意。教授崔济亚在揭发某些党员的老爷作风的时候，还念了几句打油诗。
    对于在学习外国经验中的教条主义偏向，教授们在发言中也进行了批评。有些教授批评在院系调整中有盲目扩大的缺点。教授宁榥说，对于院系调整，我认为有主观主义、教条主义毛病，希望当时负责这方面工作的钱俊瑞同志能作检查。
