He Ying, the Chinese ambassador to Mongolia, wished Voroshilov a safe journey at the door of the plane. Voroshilov shook hands with him cordially and said goodbye.

At 8:30, Voroshilov's special plane took off, carrying the friendship of the people of the four Asian countries he visited back home.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 30th. Chairman Voroshilov wrote a letter to the Mongolian people, wishing them health, happiness, and greater achievements in the great cause of building their motherland.
