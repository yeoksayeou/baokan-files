Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League National Organizations Committee held today passed a call regarding the participation of cadre League members in the central government organizations in the Party's rectification movement.

The call requested that cadre League members in central government organizations should currently conscientiously participate in the study of rectification documents organized by the Party, understand the significant historical meaning of the Party's rectification movement, and understand the principles, themes, and methods of rectification. This would enable League members to have a correct attitude towards rectification and actively and consciously devote themselves to the movement.

The call pointed out that on the basis of cadre League members participating in rectification studies and improving their understanding, League organizations in various organizations should, in accordance with the Party's rectification deployment in their own units, educate League members to actively participate in the Party's struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in accordance with the principle of "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism and self-criticism, to achieve new unity on a new basis," boldly and realistically exposing problems and providing suggestions for improving work.

The call said that in conjunction with the Party's inspection work, League organizations can also, in light of the actual thoughts of League members, use forms such as heart-to-heart talks, forums, and thematic discussions to freely discuss experiences and insights, and consolidate the achievements of the rectification. These forums and discussions can be closely integrated with the communication and implementation of the spirit of the upcoming Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League, as well as the educational activities of "how to be a Communist Youth League member."

The call also said that while participating in the Party's rectification movement, League organizations in various organizations should, according to the conditions of their own units, actively organize League members and youth in the organizations to participate in physical labor in various forms, in order to strengthen their labor perspectives and their thinking of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Since there are a large number of young people in the organizations, and the situations in each organization are not entirely the same, it is necessary to strengthen leadership and carry out the work gradually in a step-by-step manner.

    团员应该积极参加整风运动
    青年团中央国家机关委员会发出号召
    据新华社9日讯　今天举行的青年团中央国家机关委员会扩大会议，通过了关于中央国家机关干部团员参加党的整风运动的号召。
    号召中要求中央国家机关干部团员，当前应当认真参加党所组织的关于整风文件的学习，体会党的这次整风运动的重大历史意义，了解整风的方针、主题和方法。从而使团员对整风有正确的态度，积极自觉地投入到运动中去。
    号召指出，在干部团员参加整风学习和认识提高的基础上，各机关团组织应根据本单位党的整风部署，教育团员按照“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和自我批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的方针，积极参加党的反对官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的斗争，大胆地实事求是地揭发问题，提供改进工作的建议。
    号召说，结合党的检查工作，团组织还可以联系团员思想实际，运用谈心会、座谈会、专题讨论会等形式，漫谈心得和体会，巩固整风中的成果。这些座谈、讨论，可以和传达贯彻即将举行的青年团第三次全国代表大会的精神，以及“怎样做一个共青团员”的教育活动密切结合起来。
    号召还说，在参加党的整风运动的同时，各机关团组织应该根据本单位条件，通过多种形式，积极组织机关团员和青年参加体力劳动，以加强他们的劳动观点和为工农兵服务的思想。由于机关青年人数较多，各机关的情况又不尽相同，因此必须加强领导，有步骤地逐步进行。
