Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 24th. Hungarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Münnich, recently said that Hungary has successfully strengthened the local People's Assemblies, and the People's Assemblies in various regions are also able to struggle to complete their tasks.

He pointed out that the People's Assemblies in various regions generally held firm to their posts during last year's counter-revolutionary events. Now, in the vast majority of places, the leaders of the People's Assemblies who compromised with the counter-revolutionaries have been removed. In the future, attention should be paid to promoting honest, loyal to the working class, and trained people to leadership positions.

Münnich spoke on the issue of local People's Assemblies at a joint meeting of the chairmen of the executive committees of the People's Assemblies of Hungary's various states, cities, and the capital. He particularly discussed the issue of expanding the powers of the People's Assemblies, which is currently under heated discussion. He said that the government believes it is necessary to expand their scope of powers, and this will be initially realized within this year.

Münnich believes that the Party's leadership over the People's Assemblies must truly become principled leadership. Party organizations should regularly discuss the work of the People's Assemblies and focus their attention on the most important tasks.

In discussing the future tasks of the People's Assemblies, Münnich believes that they should further strengthen their ties with the residents, so as to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. He criticized the bureaucracy that hinders the work.

    明尼赫副主席说
    匈牙利将扩大人民议会职权
    据新华社布达佩斯24日电　匈牙利部长会议副主席明尼赫最近说，匈牙利已经成功地加强了地方人民会议，各地人民会议也能够为完成它们的任务而斗争。
    他指出，各地人民会议在去年反革命事件期间，一般都坚持地守住了自己的岗位。现在，在绝大多数地方，同反革命妥协的人民会议领导人已经被撤换。今后还要注意把正直的、忠于工人阶级的、受过训练的人提到领导位置上来。
    明尼赫在匈牙利全国各州、市和首都人民会议执行委员会主席联席会议上，就地方人民会议问题讲了话。他特别谈到了目前正在热烈讨论的扩大人民会议职权问题。他说，政府认为扩大它们的职权范围是必要的，并且这将在今年内初步实现。
    明尼赫认为，党对人民会议的领导要真正成为原则的领导。党组织应当定期讨论人民会议的工作，并且把注意力放在最重要的任务上。
    在谈到人民会议今后的任务时，明尼赫认为，它们应当进一步密切同居民的联系，这样才能加强无产阶级专政。他批评了阻碍着工作的官僚主义。
