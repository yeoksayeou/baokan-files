    Two Children's Songs
    Dad Wears a Glorious Flower
    Little yellow dog, wagging its tail,
    Welcomes Dad home from work.
    "Mommy, Mommy, come quickly and see,
    Dad is wearing a glorious flower!"
    "Dad, Dad, tell me,
    What great trick did you find?"
    Little Zhu Zi
    Little Zhu Zi, doesn't know shame,
    Grew a lazy bone all over:
    Lazy bone sprawled on the mattress,
    Lazy head grew on the pillow,
    Holding the quilt as clothing,
    The sun shines on his bottom,
    His mom calls him to eat breakfast,
    He says eating is not as sweet as sleeping,
    His dad calls him to go to school,
    He says he doesn't want school, only the bed.

    儿歌两首
    爸爸戴上了光荣花
    小黄狗，摇摇尾巴，
    迎着爸爸下班回到家。
    “妈妈妈妈你快看，
    爸爸戴上了光荣花。”
    “爸爸爸爸告诉我，
    你找的窍门多么大？”
    小柱子
    小柱子，不知丑，
    长了一身懒骨头：
    懒骨头瘫在褥子上，
    懒脑袋长在枕头上，
    拿着被窝当衣裳，
    太阳照在屁股上，
    他妈叫他吃早饭，
    他说吃饭没有睡觉香，
    他爹叫他上学校，
    他说不要学校光要床。
