Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Party organization of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission has begun a rectification campaign. On the afternoon of the 7th, Liu Chun delivered a report on mobilizing for the rectification campaign at the Communist Party of China's State Ethnic Affairs Commission's党员大会 (Party Member Congress).

Liu Chun said that in recent years, tremendous changes have taken place in minority areas. Over 90% of minority nationalities with conditions to establish autonomous areas have already established them; the socialist transformation of minority areas with over 85% of the minority population has achieved a decisive victory, basically resolving class contradictions; and the economy and culture of minority areas have greatly developed. With the basic victory of socialist transformation nationwide, ethnic relations within the country have developed into socialist ethnic relations, that is, relations within the working people, in areas where socialist transformation has been achieved. However, due to our insufficient understanding of this new situation and some problems in our ideological style, many shortcomings have appeared in our work, and much work has failed to keep up with the development of the situation. Therefore, rectification is necessary.

Liu Chun said that the rectification campaign in the State Ethnic Affairs Commission system mainly involves linking national ethnic work to examine and improve our work and leadership style, and to enhance our thinking. He said that, from a national perspective, the main problems in ethnic work are: (1) The autonomous rights of minority nationalities have not been fully realized, and the equal rights of ethnic components in mixed and scattered areas have not received due respect; (2) Insufficient consideration has been given to ethnic characteristics in socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) Insufficient efforts have been made in the economic construction of minority areas, and insufficient assistance has been provided to minority nationalities living in great poverty; (4) Great Han chauvinism and local nationalism still exist, with Great Han chauvinism being the main hazard in ethnic relations; (5) Leading organs are detached from the minority masses and the realities of minority areas; (6) Insufficient publicity has been given to ethnic policies and ethnic work.

Liu Chun said that this rectification campaign should adopt the method of ideological education that is both serious and earnest, yet gentle and rain-like, focusing on examining the above-mentioned issues, conducting appropriate criticism and self-criticism, enhancing understanding, and improving work. On the other hand, it is also necessary to examine the ethnic relations within the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and its affiliated units; the relationship between Party members and non-Party members; the relationship between leaders and those being led; and so on. Liu Chun said that we welcome non-Party comrades of all nationalities to offer criticisms.

### 民族事务委员会：  联系民族工作检查领导作风

    民族事务委员会：
    联系民族工作检查领导作风
    新华社7日讯　民族事务委员会党组织开始整风。7日下午，刘春在中共民族事务委员会党员大会上作了动员整风的报告。
    刘春说，近几年来，少数民族地区已经发生了巨大的变化，有条件建立自治地方的少数民族已经有90％以上建立了自治地方；85％以上人口的少数民族地区社会主义改造已经获得决定性的胜利，基本上解决了阶级矛盾；少数民族地区的经济和文化有了很大的发展。随着全国社会主义改造的基本胜利，国内的民族关系在实现了社会主义改造的地区已经发展成为社会主义的民族关系，也就是劳动人民内部的关系了。但是，由于我们对这种新情况认识不足，思想作风上存在一些问题，我们的工作中出现了不少缺点，很多工作跟不上形势发展，因此整风是必需的。
    刘春说，民族事务委员会系统的整风，主要是要联系全国民族工作来检查改进我们的工作和领导作风，提高思想。他说，从全国来看，民族工作方面的主要问题是：（1）少数民族的自治权利没有充分实现，杂居区和散居的民族成分的民族平等权利还没有受到应有的尊重；（2）在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中对民族特点照顾不够；（3）对少数民族地区的经济建设作得不够，对生活很困苦的少数民族帮助不够；（4）大汉族主义思想和地方民族主义思想还存在，大汉族主义是民族关系中的主要危害；（5）领导机关有脱离少数民族群众、脱离少数民族地区实际的情况；（6）对民族政策、民族工作的宣传不够。
    刘春说，这次整风应当采取既严肃认真又和风细雨的思想教育方法，着重对上述问题进行检查，进行恰如其分的批评和自我批评，提高认识，改进工作。另一方面，还需要检查民族事务委员会和所属单位内部的民族关系；党与非党人士的关系；领导与被领导的关系等等。刘春说，我们欢迎各民族的非党同志提出批评。
