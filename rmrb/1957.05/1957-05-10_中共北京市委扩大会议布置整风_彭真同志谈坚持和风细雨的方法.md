    Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Enlarged Meeting Arranges Rectification
    Comrade Peng Zhen Talks About Adhering to the Method of Gentle Breeze and Fine Rain

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Committee on May 8 to discuss and arrange the launch of a rectification movement within Party organizations at all levels throughout the city. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Secretaries Liu Ren, Zheng Tianxiang, and other comrades spoke based on the issues raised during the meeting's discussion.

    In his speech, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: The primary requirement for this rectification is to diligently study Chairman Mao's two reports and the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, as well as the People's Daily editorials on rectification. When studying these documents, it is necessary to prevent dogmatism; we must carefully and earnestly study and grasp the spirit and essence of the documents, use them as ideological weapons to analyze problems, examine our own work and thinking, and summarize work experience and improve our work, that is, to analyze and solve practical problems in light of the actual conditions and characteristics of our own units. He emphasized that the rectification movement must be promoted from top to bottom, starting with examining the ideological style of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee and the main leading comrades within the Party of the Municipal People's Committee, setting an example, gaining experience, and then promoting it layer by layer downwards. When leading organs and leading comrades at all levels are carrying out rectification, they must first fully listen to the opinions of comrades at the same level and lower levels, as well as non-Party friends, so that the rectification can be carried out well.

    The rectification movement must adopt a serious and conscientious attitude, and in accordance with the spirit of "correctly handling contradictions among the people," examine work, examine thinking, clarify right and wrong, enhance understanding, and improve work, but at the same time, it must adhere to the method of gentle breeze and fine rain. Some comrades say that gentle breeze and fine rain will result in no wind and no rain; other comrades say that it is gentle breeze and fine rain when talking, but when the movement starts, it becomes a storm. Both of these statements are inappropriate. Now there is already "wind and rain everywhere"; the saying of no wind and no rain means still sleeping there, not listening to opinions from all sides well. In the rectification movement, we must widely solicit opinions from all sides; when you come into contact with handling contradictions among the people, those bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjective ways of doing things cannot remain as they were, they will be exposed and criticized. The view of no wind, no rain, and no problems is unfounded. After the rectification movement is launched, will there be a storm? The specific provisions in the third paragraph of the Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement are intended to ensure that the movement can be both serious and conscientious and gentle breeze and fine rain. But when the movement starts, there may also be a little storm, as long as our leaders resolutely follow the requirements of the Central Committee's instructions, problems can be corrected in a timely manner, and the movement can develop healthily. Because the purpose of our rectification is not to rectify people, but to clarify right and wrong, enhance the Party's ideological understanding, and improve current work through rectification. In this way, the rectification movement will be carried out more deeply, and cadres will not be psychologically affected. The approach of gentle breeze and fine rain is the characteristic of this rectification movement, and Party leaders at all levels must firmly grasp this spirit so that the movement can move forward step by step.

    Based on the results of the discussion, the meeting entrusted the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee to finalize the revision of the Municipal Committee's plan for carrying out the rectification movement.

    中共北京市委扩大会议布置整风
    彭真同志谈坚持和风细雨的方法
    本报讯　5月8日中共北京市委召开市委扩大会议，讨论、布置在全市各级党组织内开展整风运动。市委第一书记彭真和书记刘仁、郑天翔等同志根据会议讨论中所提出的问题讲了话。
    彭真同志在讲话中指出：这次整风首先要求要学好毛主席的两个报告和中央关于整风运动的指示，人民日报有关整风的社论。在学习这些文件的时候，要防止教条主义；一定要仔细认真地研究和领会文件的精神实质，用它作为思想武器分析问题，检查自己的工作和思想，总结工作经验和改进工作，即结合本单位的实际情况、特点，分析和解决实际问题。他强调说明，整风运动必须自上而下地推行，首先要从检查市委常委和市人民委员会党内的主要领导同志们的思想作风开始，作出榜样，取得经验，然后层层往下推行。在各级领导机关和领导同志进行整风的时候，首先要充分听取同级、下级同志和党外朋友们的意见，这样才可能把风整好。
    整风运动必须采取严肃认真的态度，按照“正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题”的精神，检查工作，检查思想，弄清是非，提高认识，改进工作，但同时又必须坚持和风细雨的方法。有的同志说和风细雨会造成无风无雨；有的同志又说，说的时候是和风细雨，运动搞起来就是狂风暴雨。这两种说法都是不妥当的。现在已经是“满城风雨”了，无风无雨的说法是还在那里睡觉，没有很好地听听各方面的意见。在整风运动中，我们一定要广泛征求各方面的意见；当你一接触到处理人民内部矛盾的时候，那些官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义就不能原封不动地存在下去了，就会暴露出来，受到批评了。无风无雨、没有问题的看法是没有根据的。在整风运动开展起来以后，会不会有狂风暴雨呢？中央关于整风运动指示的第三段中的那些具体规定，目的就是为了保证在运动中能够既严肃认真又和风细雨。但运动搞起来也可能发生一点大风，只要我们的领导者坚决按照中央指示的要求去做，有毛病也可以及时得到纠正，使运动健康地发展。因为我们整风的目的，不是为了整人，而是要通过整风，搞清是非、提高党内的思想认识、改进当前的工作。这样整风运动就会搞得更深，干部在精神上也就不会受到打击。和风细雨的做法，是这次整风运动的特点，各级党的领导必须紧紧地掌握这种精神，使运动一步一步地向前发展。
    会议根据讨论的结果，委托市委常委会最后修订市委关于开展整风运动的计划。
