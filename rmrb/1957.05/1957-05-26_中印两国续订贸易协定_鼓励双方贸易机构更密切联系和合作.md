Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: News Communiqué on the Renewal of the Sino-Indian Trade Agreement.

    His Excellency Pan Zili, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to India, and Mr. S. Ranganathan, Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry, exchanged letters today, renewing the trade agreement between the People's Republic of China and India.
    The original Sino-Indian Trade Agreement was signed on October 14, 1954, with a validity period of two years. Representatives of the two governments have held negotiations over the past period to renew the agreement. It has now been decided that trade relations between China and India will continue to be governed by the terms of the original agreement, with only certain modifications. The amended clauses mainly concern payment procedures and the method of converting rupees into pounds sterling, which will only be carried out through accounts opened by the People's Bank of China at the Reserve Bank of India. These new payment methods will take effect from July 1, 1957. The renewed agreement will be valid until December 31, 1958.
    At the same time, Mr. Du Yuyun, Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in New Delhi, and Mr. K.B. Lall, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry, exchanged letters encouraging closer contact and cooperation between trade organizations in China and India.

    中印两国续订贸易协定
    鼓励双方贸易机构更密切联系和合作
    新华社25日讯　续订中印贸易协定新闻公报。
    中华人民共和国驻印度大使潘自力阁下和印度工商部秘书印度文官斯·朗迦那顿先生今天交换函件，续订中华人民共和国和印度之间的贸易协定。
    中印贸易协定原来是在1954年10月14日签订的，有效期限为两年。两国政府的代表在过去一个时期中，曾进行续订该协定的谈判。现在决定，中印两国的贸易关系将继续受原协定条款的约束，仅作某些修改。修改的条款主要是关于支付的手续和卢比兑换英镑的办法只通过中国人民银行在印度储备银行所开立的账户进行。这些新的支付办法将自1957年7月1日起生效。续订的协定的有效期限至1958年12月31日为止。
    同时，中华人民共和国驻新德里大使馆商务参赞杜毓云先生和印度工商部联合秘书库·毕·拉尔先生交换信件，鼓励中印两国贸易机构间的更密切的联系和合作。
