    Silk-Reeling Girls
    Cai Yan
          The beautiful silk-reeling girls are all so lovely, their bright attire attracting so many eyes. Only the most beautiful people can create the most beautiful products. The girls bring silk to the world.
            Hands I want to shake the hands of every silk-reeling girl, because their hands are even more nimble than those of the weaving maiden in heaven. Even if the weaving maiden can weave peerless fabrics, how could she reel such soft, pure white, light silk...
          Laughter I want to store up the laughter of the silk-reeling girls. I want to take it everywhere. If anyone asks how the silk-reeling workers are living, please let them hear how joyfully the girls are laughing.

    缫丝姑娘
    彩燕
          美缫丝姑娘们个个如此美丽，鲜艳的打扮吸引了多少人的眼，最美的人才会创造出最美的产品，姑娘们把丝带到了人间。
            手我想把每一双缫丝姑娘的手都握遍，因为她们的手比天上织女的手还要伶俐，织女纵然能织出世上无双的布匹，但哪能缫出如此柔软、洁白的轻丝……
          笑  声我要把缫丝姑娘的笑声储藏起来，我要把它带到四面八方，若有人问起缫丝工人生活得怎样？就请他们听听姑娘们笑得那样欢狂。
