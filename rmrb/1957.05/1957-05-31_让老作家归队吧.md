Let the Old Writers Return to the Ranks
Gu Jiaxi

After the national liberation, many warriors who were once active on the cultural and ideological front were transferred to various government organs to do leadership work, and they stopped writing from then on. In the past, these people wrote articles every day, their thoughts met with readers every day, readers had feelings for them, and they had prestige among readers. Now, some have become heads of cultural departments, some have become editors of publishing houses, some are serving as administrative leaders, and some have become diplomats. They are immersed in frequent meetings of all sizes all day long.

If we were to conduct a survey, I am afraid we could list a hundred or so veteran writers who have been transferred to other fields. These comrades are all skilled in writing, and they often complain to newspaper and magazine editors, hoping to get more time to write. They have a strong urge to write about today's new things, as well as the shortcomings that exist in new things, but they have no time to write. Many old writers are unable to complete their annual writing plans. As Comrade Lao She recently said: Think about it, what is more difficult and embarrassing than being able to write but not being able to?

Newspapers and magazines should become a good place for them to show their talents. Our newspaper supplements and progressive literary magazines have a fine tradition of combat, fighting against all kinds of enemy ideas, and growing up in slander and massacre. These supplements and magazines have cultivated our older generation of writers. It can be said that there are very few old writers who have not tried their hand at writing in newspaper supplements or magazines. Many of Lu Xun's works with antennae and sensitive nerves were published in supplements or magazines. From Lu Xun's writing of "Random Thoughts" in "New Youth" until the eve of liberation, this tradition has never been broken. However, from 1949 until last summer, these things could not be found in our newspapers and periodicals.

Not to mention the distant past, there are many things in the newspapers since the surrender of Japan that are worth remembering, such as the essays signed Sima Niu in Chongqing's "Xinhua Daily," the "Earthworm Eyes" signed Dongfeng in Shanghai's "World Morning Post," the "Teahouse Chats" signed Wang Laoji and the "Snail Essays" signed Ren Huizhi in the Hong Kong version of "The Masses," and the short articles and musings in the "Today and Tomorrow" and "Today's Talk" columns in "Hua Shang Bao."

Some of these short articles have only a dozen or so words, but they are still unforgettable today. Like Sima Niu's "Hurley! He, Hurley, China is at a disadvantage." Like Dongfeng's warning after the Kuomintang military intelligence chief Dai Li died in a plane crash, in view of the fact that some progressive people were very happy about it and relaxed their vigilance, "Chinese people have always valued people and not systems," which has become our ideological weapon until the opposition to the cult of personality. I think such talented writers, whose writing has contributed to the democratic revolution yesterday, can better play a huge role in correctly handling contradictions among the people today.

"Liberating" the older generation of writers from administrative affairs and social activities to strengthen our ideological front is an easy and urgent task. I remember that in the group of paintings published in the 1956 New Year's edition of "Literary Gazette," an old writer was depicted writing in a car, which depicted the contradiction between writing and social work. From this, it can be seen that our sensitive cartoonists had already raised this issue at that time. However, this situation has not changed until today, which has caused us some losses in ideological work.

If it was necessary to have writers do administrative work when we were just liberated, then today, it is time to liberate these writers from administrative positions or social activities.

    让老作家归队吧
    顾家熙
    全国解放之后，很多从前活跃在文化思想战线上的战士，被调到各种机关做领导工作，从那时起他们就搁笔了。从前这些人天天写文章，他们的思想天天和读者见面，读者对他们有感情，他们在读者中间有威信。如今，有的做了文化部门的负责人，有的当了出版社的编辑，有的在担任行政领导，有的做了外交官。他们整天浸沉在频繁的大小会议里。
    如果真要做一个调查的话，恐怕能举出百把位转业的老作家来。这些同志都是擅常写作的，他们常常向报刊编辑诉苦，很想能得到更多的写作的时间。他们对今天的新事物，以及新事物中存在着的缺点，很有写作的冲动，可是无暇执笔。有好些老作家每年所订的写作计划都无法完成。诚如老舍同志最近所说：想想看，什么比会写而不能写更难过、难堪的呢？
    报纸和刊物应该成为他们大显身手的好地方。我们报纸副刊和进步文艺杂志有着优良的战斗传统，它曾和各式各样的敌人思想进行斗争，它是在污蔑和屠杀中成长起来的。这些副刊和杂志培养了我们老一代的作家，老作家没有在报纸副刊或杂志上试过笔的，可以说是绝无仅有。鲁迅的那些时代的触角和感应神经的作品，很多都是发表在副刊或杂志上的。从鲁迅在“新青年”上写“随感录”起一直到解放前夕，这传统一直也没有断过，然而从1949年起，直到去年夏天，这些东西在我们的报刊上找不到了。
    远的不谈，只就日本投降以后来说就有许多报上的东西是值得我们怀念的，像重庆“新华日报”上署名司马牛的杂感，在上海“世界晨报”上署名东风的“蚯蚓眼”，在港版“群众”上署名汪老吉的“茶亭杂话”和署名任晦之的“蜗牛随笔”，以及在“华商报”上“今日和明日”“今日谈”等栏中的短文和絮语等都是。
    这些短文有的只寥寥十数字，但直到今天还令人难忘。像司马牛的“赫尔利！赫，尔利，中国不利。”像东风在国民党军统头子戴笠跌死后，鉴于有些进步人士为之大高兴而放松警惕时所发出的“中国人一直是重视人而不重视制度”的警号，直到反对个人崇拜的时候都成为我们思想上的武器。我想有这种有才能的作家，他们的生花之笔，昨天为民主革命做了贡献，今天也可以更好地为正确处理人民内部矛盾而起巨大作用的。
    把老一辈的作家从行政事务工作和社会活动中“解放”出来，以加强我们的思想战线，是轻而易举的当务之急。记得在1956年新年出版的“文艺报”组画中把一位老作家画在汽车里写作，这绘出了写作和社会工作的矛盾。由此可见我们感觉锐敏的漫画家在那时已把这个问题提出来了。然而直到今天，这种情形还未改变，以致在思想工作上使我们遭到了一些损失。
    如果说刚解放时让作家做行政工作是有其必要的话，那么时至今日，就已到了把这些作家从行政岗位或社会活动中解放出来的时候了。
