    Some People are Full of Worries About Carrying Out the Rectification Campaign
    Editor's Note: Communist Party organizations at all levels are studying and arranging rectification studies. During discussions, there are various opinions on how to carry out rectification. Today, we publish a letter from a party member, which raises some of his opinions. These opinions are worth noting. We hope everyone will write letters to express their opinions on how to carry out the rectification campaign. Comrade Editor:
    Everyone was very happy after the Party Central Committee issued the instruction on rectification, and felt that it was indeed necessary to propose rectification now. However, opinions differ on why rectification is necessary. Some people feel that the thinking of cadres cannot keep up with the requirements of the new situation and they cannot handle contradictions among the people. Rectification can improve their understanding, change their work style, and improve their work. Some people feel that there are indeed many deviations and errors in our work, and if we don’t rectify them, it will be unacceptable. Some people think that some of our leading comrades are too detached from reality and the masses, and it is dangerous to continue like this, so we need to rectify them. Some comrades are also very happy to hear about rectification, but they lack confidence as to whether the problems can be truly solved. They feel that they have experienced many large and small movements in recent years, and have made many suggestions to the leaders, and many of these suggestions have been made repeatedly, but the problems have still not been resolved. Will these suggestions definitely have an effect this time? Some comrades have great concerns about making suggestions to the leaders of their units. They feel that the leaders do not like or even hate to listen to criticism from below, and they are afraid that making suggestions will not only be useless, but will also cause them to be treated unfairly in the future. Some comrades feel that the issues of principles and policies are all decided by the leaders. This rectification must focus on the leaders, but they doubt whether they can rectify the top leaders of their units. Or they feel that although the leaders of their units can be rectified, some issues also involve higher-level leading organs. Can this rectification rectify them? Can they listen to and adopt the opinions of lower levels in a timely and humble manner? As far as I know, not only ordinary cadres lack confidence in rectification, but also some leading cadres. On the one hand, they are watching the higher-level leading organs, fearing that they will not examine themselves well and listen to opinions; on the other hand, they feel that lower-level cadres only want to rectify the upper level, while the lower-level cadres themselves also have many problems. It is also impossible to do a good job without rectifying the thinking and work style of these comrades. They are also afraid that after mobilizing the masses, the masses will not understand the difficulties of the leaders and will make excessive demands and inappropriate accusations against the leaders, making it impossible for the leaders to step down and increasing difficulties for future leadership work.
    In short, based on the situation of some comrades I have contacted, everyone has different views and concerns about why rectification is needed and whether rectification can solve the main problems of their units. If these concerns are not eliminated, the development of the rectification campaign may be affected. I don’t understand, what should be done to eliminate concerns and make everyone full of confidence in the rectification campaign?

### 开展整风运动有人顾虑重重

    开展整风运动有人顾虑重重
    编者按：各级共产党的党组织正在研究和布置整风学习，在讨论中，对如何进行整风有各种不同的意见，今天发表一封党员来信，提出了他的一些意见，这些意见都是值得注意的。希望大家来信就如何进行整风发表意见。编辑同志：
    党中央发出整风指示以后，大家都很高兴，觉得现在提出整风确实必要。但是，究竟为什么要整风呢？大家的看法却不一样。有人觉得干部的思想赶不上新形势的要求，不会处理人民内部矛盾，整了风可以提高认识水平，改变作风，改进工作。有人觉得我们工作中的偏差错误的确不少，再不整一下，实在不成。有人认为是因为我们有些领导同志脱离实际、脱离群众太厉害了，发展下去很危险，所以要整风。还有一些同志听到整风也很高兴，但是一想到能不能真正解决问题又有些信心不足。他们觉得最近几年来经历过大大小小的好多次运动，对领导已经提过不少意见，而且有许多意见是提了再提，可是问题仍然不得解决，这次再提是不是就一定会有效果呢？有些同志对给自己单位的领导者提意见有很大顾虑，他们感到领导者不大喜欢甚至讨厌听取下边的批评，害怕提了意见不但不顶事，日后还会给自己“小鞋”穿。有些同志觉得方针政策问题都是领导决定的，这次整风一定要好好整整领导，可是，他们对于能不能整到自己单位的最高领导同志，还感到怀疑；或者觉得虽则能整到本单位的领导者，可是有些问题还牵扯到更高一级的领导机关，这次整风能不能整到他们呢？下级对他们的意见，他们能够及时听取虚心采纳吗？据我了解，对整风感到信心不足的不但有一般干部，也有一些领导干部，他们一方面眼看着更高级的领导机关，怕他们不很好的检查自己听取意见；一方面又觉得下级干部只想整上级，而下级干部本身也有很多毛病，不整顿这些同志的思想作风也不能搞好工作。他们还害怕发动群众以后，群众不了解领导的困难，对领导提出过高的要求，不适当的指责，使领导者不能下台，给今后的领导工作增加困难。
    总之，就我所接触到的一些同志的情况看来，大家对为什么要整风、整风究竟能不能解决本单位的主要问题，还有各种不同的看法和顾虑。这些顾虑不消除，整风运动的开展恐怕就要受到影响，我不明白，究竟要怎样作才能消除顾虑，使大家对整风运动充满信心呢？
