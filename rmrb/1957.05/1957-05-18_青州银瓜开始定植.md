    Qingzhou Silver Melon Planting Begins

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Qingzhou silver melon, which has always been sold far and wide to cities and mining areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang, has now begun to be planted; it is expected to be available on the market successively by the end of June or the beginning of July.

    The Qingzhou silver melon is produced on both banks of the Er River in Yidu County, Shandong Province. Because it has the characteristics of white skin, thick flesh, fragrant and crisp taste, it enjoys a high reputation. This year, in order to allow more urban and rural people to eat Qingzhou silver melons, the agricultural cooperatives in various townships on both banks of the Er River have expanded the planting area, and carried out sowing, seedling cultivation, and planting work in advance.

    青州银瓜开始定植
    本报讯　一向远销北京、天津、济南、青岛、潍坊等城市及工矿区的青州银瓜，现在已经开始定植；预计到6月底或7月初，即可陆续上市。
    青州银瓜，产于山东益都县的洱河两岸。由于它具有皮白、肉厚、香脆可口等特点，因而享有盛名。今年，洱河两岸各乡的农业社，为了让更多的城乡人民能吃到青州银瓜，都扩大了种植面积，并提前进行了播种、育苗、定植等工作。
