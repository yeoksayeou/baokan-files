Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 12th: The meeting of the Presidiums of the Parliaments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic concluded on May 11th. The joint statement of the three Presidiums of Parliaments was also signed on this day at the Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam (the meeting place of the Potsdam Conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States in 1945).

In the joint statement, the Presidiums of the Parliaments of the three countries condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's decision in principle to equip West Germany with atomic and hydrogen weapons, and stated, "We welcome and support all expressions of protest against the stationing of atomic armed forces on West German territory, and demand that the people, parliaments, and governments of all European countries resolutely oppose this policy."

The Presidiums of the Parliaments of the three countries also condemned West Germany's revanchist threats against the borders of Poland and Czechoslovakia, against the security of the German Democratic Republic, and against the Soviet Union and other countries. They "firmly reiterate that the existing borders of the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Republic are final and inviolable. The security and inviolability of the German Democratic Republic are unwavering conditions for maintaining peace in Europe."

"In view of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the danger of atomic armament, the participants of the meeting unanimously agreed that the Warsaw Treaty is a guarantee of the peaceful life of the European people, and every effort must be made to further strengthen the defense forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization."

The joint statement stated that the parliaments of the three countries will in the future "make every effort to promote the further consolidation and unity of socialist countries, and to promote closer cooperation between them."

The statement believes that "the most urgent issues at present are the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. As a first step towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the testing of such weapons must be stopped."

The participants of the meeting opposed treaties such as the European "Atomic Energy Community" and the "Common Market," and opposed artificially dividing the European continent. They support the establishment of an effective European collective security system, believing that this system will be conducive to the resolution of fundamental European issues, especially the issue of German reunification.

    波捷德三国议会主席团联合声明
    必须加强华沙条约组织防卫力量
    要求欧洲各国反对用核武器装备西德
    新华社柏林12日电　波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国三国议会主席团会议已经在5月11日结束。三国议会主席团联合声明也在这一天在波茨坦的齐齐林宫（1945年苏、英、美三国政府首脑波茨坦会议的集会地）签了字。
    三国议会主席团在联合声明中谴责北大西洋集团理事会在原则上决定了以原子武器和氢武器装备西德，并且说，“我们欢迎和支持一切抗议在西德领土上驻扎原子武装部队的言论，并且要求所有欧洲各国的人民、议会和政府坚决反对这种政策”。
    三国议会主席团也谴责西德对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的疆界以及对德意志民主共和国的安全、对苏联和其他国家所作的复仇主义的恫吓，它们“坚决地重申：波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的现有疆界是最后划定的和不可侵犯的。德意志民主共和国的安全和不可侵犯性是维护欧洲和平的不可动摇的条件。”
   “鉴于北大西洋集团的扩张和进行原子武装的危险，会议的参加者一致认为：华沙条约是欧洲人民和平生活的保证，必须尽一切力量进一步加强华沙条约组织的防卫力量”。
    联合声明表示，三国的议会将在今后“尽一切力量促进社会主义国家的进一步巩固和团结，促进它们相互间更紧密地合作。”
    声明认为，“当前最迫切的问题是实行裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器。作为走向禁止核武器的第一步，是停止试验这种武器。”
    会议的参加者反对欧洲“原子能联营”和“共同市场”之类的条约，反对人为地分裂欧洲大陆。他们支持建立一个有效的欧洲集体安全体系，认为这一体系将有利于欧洲基本问题、特别是德国统一问题的解决。
