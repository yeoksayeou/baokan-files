    Editing Recollections
    —On the “Anthology of World Short Stories” Zhao Jiabi
    Regarding the Russian and Soviet volumes, there were differing opinions about the title at the time, and whether to publish them together or separately was also undecided. Mr. Geng Jizhi suggested in a letter that we could use the general term "Anthology of Russian Short Stories" and divide it into Volume A: Old Russia and Volume B: New Russia. At the time, some in cultural circles did refer to the Soviet Union as New Russia, but some opposed doing so. This dispute was resolved with the help of Mr. Mao Dun.
  In his letter of June 7, 1937, he said:
   “I will first answer your inquiry about the dispute between New Russia and Old Russia. I
    think works before the revolution can be in one volume, called Old Russia;
    or simply "Russia" is also acceptable. As for works after the revolution,
    it is more appropriate to use the term Soviet Union, as Soviet Union
    is the abbreviation of the official country name, which is USSR.
    The term New Russia should definitely not be used as the title. I
    think the book can be divided into two volumes, one, Russia, two, Soviet
    Union. ...Russia represents the past, Soviet Union
    represents the future, and there is no need to add an adjective to Russia.”
    At that time, Mr. Geng Jizhi was working at the Soviet embassy, and we thought it would be more convenient for him to collect new materials abroad, so we originally planned to ask him to compile the "Soviet Collection" and Mr. Cao Jinghua to compile the "Russian Collection." However, Mr. Cao Jinghua wrote in a letter on November 29, 1936: "It would be best if Mr. Geng and I switched. I think Mr. Geng loves Old Russian things, while I adore New Russian things. I really don't feel any interest in old things, otherwise it would be a thankless task." As a result, the two switched. In 1939, Jizhi returned from abroad and lived in Shanghai. He told me unintentionally that he had already completed the "Russian Collection" in the Soviet Union. He said that it was now obviously useless. At that time, besides apologizing to him, what else could I say?
    After the Morning Light Publishing Company was established in 1947, it first published his complete translation of "The Brothers Karamazov," which was also a kind of atonement to him, because in 1942, "Liangyou" only published the first half for him, but he didn't even get to see it himself. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo said in the preface to this book:
    “The first volume had just been printed when the Pacific War broke out, and Liangyou Company was forced to close down, and all the printed books were lost. The last time he left Shanghai to go to the Northeast, he was still thinking about the fate of this book. Now, Mr. Zhao Jiabi resolutely publishes it all at once, but he himself is no longer able to see it.”
    Mr. Geng Jizhi died in 1946. Although he did not live to see the publication of "The Brothers Karamazov," the book was finally delivered to thousands of readers. What I really regret is that he had already compiled the "Russian Collection," and I didn't even dare to ask him to see it. I don't know if his family still keeps it for him. This made me think of Wang Shuo's and Lu Yan's works, especially the dozen or so newly translated pieces at the time, which, although given to me during their lifetime, were buried in my bookcase for twenty years. Which of the other compilers hadn't put in more or less unpaid labor for it?
    Today, the vast number of readers urgently need informative reading materials. Books like the "Anthology of New Chinese Literature" are priced outrageously in old bookstores; the editing plan for the "Anthology of World Short Stories," if properly revised and re-ordered by the relevant publishing houses, may still be a worthwhile project to consider.

    编辑忆旧
    ——关于世界短篇小说大系	赵家璧
    关于俄国与苏联两集，当时对书名意见既有不同，合出、分出也莫衷一是。耿济之先生来信提出可用俄国短篇小说集总称而分甲集旧俄之部、乙集新俄之部；当时的文化界确有称苏联为新俄的，但有人反对这样做。这个争论还是茅盾先生帮助我们解决了。
  他在1937年6月7日的信上说：
   “兹先答尊询新俄旧俄之争。鄙
    意革命前作品为一册，可称旧俄；
    或径名“俄国”亦无不可。至于革
    命后作品，以用苏联为妥，盖苏联
    为正式国名之缩写，就是USSR
    也。新俄二字决不宜用为书名。鄙
    意书可分二册，一、俄国，二、苏
    联。……俄国二字代表以前，苏联
    二字代表以后，俄上无须加形容字。”
    那时耿济之先生正在苏联使馆工作，我们认为他在国外搜集新资料比较方便，原议约他编选“苏联集”，而约曹靖华先生编“俄国集”。但是曹靖华先生1936年11月29日来信说：“最好是我与耿先生对换。我看耿先生很爱旧俄东西，而我则酷爱新俄东西，我对旧东西实在感觉不到兴趣，不然是吃力不讨好。”结果两人就相互对调了。1939年济之从国外回来，蛰居上海，在无意中他告诉我他早在苏联时已把“俄国集”全部编成了。他说现在显然已成了无用之物。那时我除了向他抱歉外，又有什么话可说呢？
    1947年晨光出版公司成立后，最先出版了他的“卡拉马助夫兄弟们”全译本，也作为对他的一种赎罪，因为1942年“良友”只替他出了上半部，可是也没有给他自己所看见。郑振铎先生在这本书的序文中说：
    “第一部方才印出，太平洋战争便爆发了，良友公司被迫停业，印好的书也全部失散了。他最后一次离开上海而到东北去时，还念念不忘于这部书的运命，现在赵家璧先生竟毅然的把她全部一次出版，而他自己已经不及见了。”
    耿济之先生死于1946年，虽不及见“卡拉马助夫兄弟们”的出版，但书毕竟送到了万千读者的手中。真正使我抱憾的倒是他那部已编好的“俄国集”，我连看都不敢向他要来看，不知道他的遗族是否还为他保存着。我因而想到望舒和鲁彦的作品，尤其是当时新译的十几篇东西，虽已在生前交给了我，却在我书橱中被埋没了二十年。其他几位编选人，又哪个不曾为它多多少少付出了无代价的劳动呢？
    今天广大读者急需资料性的读物。“中国新文学大系”之类的书旧书店索价奇昂；“世界短篇小说大系”的编辑计划，有关出版社如加以适当地修改重订，也许还是一个值得考虑的选题。（续完）
