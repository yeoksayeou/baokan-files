Xinhua News Agency, London, May 1st: Soviet representative Zorin submitted new proposals from the Soviet government on local disarmament measures to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee on April 30th.

    In order to strive for agreement on local disarmament, the Soviet Union has taken new steps on the issue of international supervision to move closer to the Western position, expressing agreement to conduct aerial photography not only in Europe but also in a vast area of the Far East. This region includes, on the one hand, the eastern part of Siberia, the Maritime Province, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and Sakhalin Island, with a total area of 7,129,000 square kilometers; and on the other hand, Alaska and the western United States, with a total area of 7,063,000 square kilometers. Zorin said that the Soviet Union had given special consideration to the U.S. insistence on broad aerial inspection.

    The new Soviet proposal stipulates that minimum disarmament measures should be adopted. In terms of nuclear disarmament, the immediate and separate resolution of the issue of stopping or temporarily suspending the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons should be prioritized. All countries should also guarantee not to use any type of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The Soviet proposal also stipulates that in the first stage, the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should each be reduced to 2.5 million, and the armed forces of Britain and France should each be reduced to 750,000; further reductions would then be made, with the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China each reduced to 1 million to 1.5 million, and the armed forces of Britain and France each reduced to 650,000. Zorin also emphasized that the Soviet Union's strategic position is unique (vast territory, long borders, the existence of military bases and military alliances targeting the Soviet Union near its borders). Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot agree to an equal reduction of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States to 2.5 million unless everyone simultaneously guarantees that the armed forces of both countries will subsequently be reduced to 1 million to 1.5 million (the United States and its partners had previously advocated this).

    The Soviet government proposed simultaneously reducing armaments and military expenditures. The first step must be to reduce conventional armaments and military expenditures by 15%, rather than the 10% currently advocated by the United States, while also stipulating continued reductions in the future.

    In the Soviet proposal, the issue of abolishing military bases located on the territory of other countries and withdrawing the atomic forces stationed there, and the issue of taking measures to reduce the troops of the four powers stationed in Germany, withdrawing the Soviet armed forces stationed in Warsaw Pact countries, and the troops of the United States, Britain, and France stationed in NATO countries, occupy an important position. The Soviet Union is willing to reach an agreement with Western governments stipulating that atomic weapons should not be stored on German territory.

    The Soviet proposal further stipulates appropriate international supervision. The Soviet Union believes it is necessary to reach an agreement to establish a supervisory body within the framework of the Security Council and to establish monitoring stations responsible for preventing sudden attacks. The Soviet Union proposes establishing monitoring stations in the western border regions of the Soviet Union and the eastern United States, on the territories of NATO countries and Warsaw Pact countries, and in aerial photography areas.

    At the same meeting, the Soviet representative also submitted a draft "Declaration on Measures to Strengthen World Peace and Security of All Peoples," which, in addition to proposing that all countries undertake the solemn obligation not to use various atomic and hydrogen weapons for military purposes, also proposes that all countries declare their continued efforts to quickly reach an agreement: to completely prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons and to eliminate such weapons from the armaments of all countries. All countries declare their obligation to take necessary measures to stop war propaganda and implement peaceful coexistence among all countries.

### 为了争取在局部裁军上达成协议  苏联赞同在广大地区进行空中摄影

    为了争取在局部裁军上达成协议
    苏联赞同在广大地区进行空中摄影
    新华社1日讯  据塔斯社伦敦消息：苏联代表佐林4月30日向联合国裁军小组委员会提出了苏联政府关于局部裁军措施的新建议。
    为了争取在局部裁军上达成协议，苏联在国际监督问题上采取新的步骤来向西方主张靠拢，表示同意不仅在欧洲而且也在远东的一个广大地区进行空中摄影，在远东这一地区一方面包括西伯利亚东部地区和滨海地区堪察加半岛和库页岛，总面积为七百一十二万九千平方公里；另一方面则包括阿拉斯加和美国西部，总面积为七百零六万三千平方公里。佐林说，苏联特别考虑到了美国坚持进行广泛的空中视察的态度。
    苏联新建议中规定要采取最低限度的裁军措施。在原子裁军方面，首先应当立即单独解决停止或者暂时中止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。各国还要保证不使用一切型式的原子武器和氢武器。
    苏联的建议还规定，在第一阶段，美国、苏联和中国的武装部队各裁减到二百五十万人，英国和法国的武装部队各裁减到七十五万人；以后进一步裁减，美国、苏联和中国的武装部队各裁减到一百万到一百五十万人，英国和法国的武装部队各裁减到六十五万人。佐林同时着重地指明，苏联所处的战略地位特殊（领土广大、国境线长、在边界附近存在着针对着苏联的军事基地和军事联盟），因此，苏联不能够同意苏美两国的武装部队平等地裁减到二百五十万人，除非大家同时保证随后还要把两国的武装部队各裁减到一百万到一百五十万人（早先美国和它的伙伴们也曾经主张这样作）。
    苏联政府建议同时要削减军备和军事费用。第一步必须把常规军备和军事费用削减15％而不是像美国目前所主张的削减10％，同时还要规定以后继续削减。
    在苏联的建议中，关于撤销设在其他国家领土上的军事基地并且撤退驻在那里的原子部队的问题，关于采取措施削减四国驻在德国的部队、撤退苏联驻在华沙条约国家的武装部队以及美、英、法三国驻在北大西洋公约组织国家的部队的问题，占有重要的地位。苏联愿意同西方国家政府达成协议，规定不得在德国领土上储存原子武器。
    苏联的建议进一步规定了适当的国际监督。苏联认为有必要达成协议在安全理事会范围内成立一个监督机构，并且建立监督站负责防止突然的袭击。苏联建议在苏联西部边境地区和美国东部，在北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约国家的领土上，以及在空中摄影地区设立监督站。
    苏联代表在同一天会议上还提出了一项“加强世界和平和各国人民安全措施宣言”草案，其中除建议各国承担不在军事上使用各种原子武器和氢武器的庄严义务以外，还建议各国宣布继续努力以便迅速达成协议：完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且从各国军备中取消这种武器。各国宣布有义务采取必要的措施来制止战争宣传，实行各国和平共处。
