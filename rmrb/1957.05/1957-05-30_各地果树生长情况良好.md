    (Reported by this newspaper) This spring, although various regions experienced heavy snow and several strong winds, the flowering and fruit-bearing situation of major fruit trees is still good. Liaoning Province estimates that apple production can increase by 17% compared to last year. The Huangyan mandarin orange trees in Zhejiang Province are growing vigorously, an unprecedented phenomenon in a century. It is estimated that the province's total output can exceed 800,000 dan, an increase of more than 20% compared to the historical peak output of 650,000 dan in 1954. With good management, Nanfeng honey mandarin oranges in Jiangxi can strive for an increase of about one-third compared to last year. Chao yang tangerines in Guangdong originally planned to produce 500,000 to 600,000 dan this year, but current estimates put production at a minimum of 600,000 dan or more. Based on current growth conditions, there are also hopes for a bumper harvest of loquats, lychees, longans, and other fruits in Putian, Fujian.

    各地果树生长情况良好
    本报讯　今年春天，各地虽然遇到大雪，又刮过几次大风，但是主要果树开花结果情况仍然良好。辽宁省的苹果估计可比去年增产17％。浙江省黄岩桔树生长旺盛为百年来所未有，估计全省产量可超过八十万担，比1954年历史最高年产量六十五万担还要增产二成以上。江西南丰蜜桔管理得好，可以争取比去年增产三分之一左右。广东潮阳的柑桔，今年计划产五、六十万担，但目前估计产量最少在六十万担以上。福建莆田的枇杷、荔枝、龙眼等果品，根据目前生长情况，也有丰收希望。
