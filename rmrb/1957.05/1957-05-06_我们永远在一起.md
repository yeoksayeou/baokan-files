    We Will Always Be Together

    After a friendly visit to our country for twenty-one days, Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests are leaving Beijing today for the Republic of Indonesia.

    Chairman Voroshilov, the envoy of the great Soviet people, received an unprecedentedly warm welcome in our country during this visit to China, which is the most profound manifestation of the rock-solid unity and traditional deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. This friendly visit will be recorded in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship as a most glorious chapter.

    During these unforgettable days of Chairman Voroshilov's visit, our entire nation was immersed in a surging ocean of friendship. The spring breeze of friendship blew into everyone's heart, and everyone's heart was connected with Chairman Voroshilov, the envoy of the Soviet people. Our entire nation not only welcomed him as our most esteemed state guest, but also received him as our most beloved guest and closest friend and brother. Many of us affectionately called him "Old Voroshilov" according to Chinese custom, and the children called him "Dear Grandpa Old Voroshilov." Wherever Chairman Voroshilov went, red flags covered the sky and flowers filled the ground; everywhere was a scene of people thronging the streets and thunderous cheers. National newspapers devoted a large amount of space to reporting on Old Voroshilov's visit, and radio broadcasts repeatedly broadcast live recordings of welcomes to Old Voroshilov and news of his visit. The vast number of Chinese people who did not have the opportunity to personally attend the welcome rallies and did not meet Old Voroshilov, cared about the details of Old Voroshilov's visit and tour as if they were their own relatives, and listened attentively to Old Voroshilov's inspiring speeches. The entire Chinese people regarded Chairman Voroshilov's visit as a festival of Sino-Soviet friendship. The workers of the factory that Chairman Voroshilov was going to visit presented him with carefully made souvenirs; the farmers who were fortunate enough to receive Chairman Voroshilov's visit sent him the treasures they had harvested; young students wrote letters to Chairman Voroshilov with surging enthusiasm to express their greetings; poets composed poems, lyricists wrote lyrics, painters painted pictures, calligraphers wielded their brushes, epigraphers engraved seals, horticulturalists presented flowers, and craftsmen dedicated their masterpieces... It is no exaggeration to say that the entire nation was involved in this climax of Sino-Soviet friendship, and that everyone devoted their greatest enthusiasm to the envoy of our great ally, the Soviet people.

    In just twenty-one days, Chairman Voroshilov visited many cities, toured many enterprises and projects, and visited and toured many scenic spots and historical sites. During this period, Chairman Voroshilov had cordial meetings with our national leaders, social activists, generals and soldiers, people from the fields of literature and art, education, science, religion, industry and commerce, as well as young students and children. He also celebrated the "May Day" International Labor Day with the people of Beijing and participated in a grand garden party. These visits and meetings of Chairman Voroshilov with people from a wide range of sectors in our country not only brought the deep friendship of the great Soviet people to the Chinese people, but also greatly enhanced mutual understanding, pushing the traditional friendship and great unity between our two countries to a new peak.

    Although Chairman Voroshilov's time with the Chinese people was short, his vigorous spirit and youthful vigor, his enthusiastic and generous personality, and his kind, sincere, and approachable attitude left the most profound and unforgettable impression on the Chinese people. The scene of our ally's Soviet head of state getting along so well with the Chinese people and being as close as brothers once again showed the world the unbreakable unity and fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. We, the Chinese people, have personally experienced the great significance of this unity and friendship, just as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This unity and friendship is not only a favorable factor in the socialist and communist construction of our two countries, but also an important part of the unity of socialist countries, and a reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress."

    Chairman Voroshilov gave us great encouragement and support in all aspects during his visit to China. Chairman Voroshilov gave high praise to our current great cause of socialist construction, especially to our policy of socialist industrialization based on the priority development of heavy industry, to our socialist transformation of agriculture through cooperation, and to our socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce carried out in a peaceful manner. In his several speeches, Chairman Voroshilov reiterated that the Soviet government fully supports the Chinese people's desire to return Taiwan to the motherland and supports the demand for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Chairman Voroshilov repeatedly emphasized the consolidation and development of friendship and comprehensive cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and enthusiastically stated that "the Soviet Union has always been and will always be a friend and brother of great China," and will continue to provide our country with selfless assistance in the future. We express our deep gratitude to Chairman Voroshilov for expressing the great Soviet Union's sincere concern, friendship, and support for our people.

    Loving peace and advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems are the firm and unwavering policies of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, in foreign affairs. Therefore, Chairman Voroshilov's lofty aspirations for safeguarding world peace and opposing war are also the common aspirations of the people of our two countries. The Chinese people will always remember the aphorism spoken by Chairman Voroshilov: "I love generals, but I oppose war"; "I raise my glass to wish that all people on Earth live in peace, without thinking of war, and strive for world peace." The Chinese people will forever work with the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving people in the world, to maintain peace and the cause of human progress.

    We respectfully wish Chairman Voroshilov's visit to the Republic of Indonesia important achievements in strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia and in promoting peace in Asia and the world.

    我们永远在一起
    伏罗希洛夫主席和苏联贵宾们在我国进行二十一天的友好访问后，今天就要离开北京前往印度尼西亚共和国了。
    伟大苏联人民的使者伏罗希洛夫主席这次到中国来访问，他在我国受到的空前热烈的欢迎，是中苏两国人民坚如磐石般的团结和传统的深厚友谊的最深刻的表现。这次友好访问，将作为最光辉灿烂的篇章载入中苏友好的史册。
    在伏罗希洛夫主席访问的这些难忘的日子里，我们全国人民都浸沉在热情奔腾的友谊海洋里。友谊的春风吹拂到每一个人的心上，每一个人的心都和苏联人民的使者伏罗希洛夫主席连在一起。我们全国人民不仅把他作为我们最高贵的国宾来欢迎他，而且作为我们最敬爱的客人和最亲切的朋友兄弟来接待他。我们很多人都按照中国的习惯，亲切地称呼他为“伏老”，而孩子们则管他叫“亲爱的伏老爷爷”。在伏罗希洛夫主席所到之处，到处是红旗蔽天，鲜花满地；到处是万人空巷、欢声雷动。全国报纸用大量篇幅来报道伏老的访问，无线电广播在一次又一次地播送欢迎伏老的实况录音和访问的消息，没有机会亲自参加欢迎大会和没有同伏老会见的广大中国人民，像关心自己的亲人一样，从报纸上和广播中关心着伏老访问、参观的细节，关心地聆听着伏老激动人心的演说。全中国人民都把伏罗希洛夫主席的访问作为中苏友好的节日。伏罗希洛夫主席要参观的工厂，工人把精心地制作的纪念品献给他；有幸接待伏罗希洛夫主席访问的农民，把自己收获的珍品送给他；青年学生们热情澎湃地给伏罗希洛夫主席写信问候；诗人赋诗、词人填词、画家作画、书法家挥毫、金石家雕刻、园艺家赠花、手工艺家奉献自己的杰作……可以毫不夸张地说，全国人民都卷入这个中苏友好的高潮里，都把自己最大的热情寄与我们伟大盟邦苏联人民的使者。
    在短短的二十一天当中，伏罗希洛夫主席访问了许多城市，参观了不少企业和工程，访问和游览了许多名胜古迹。在这期间，伏罗希洛夫主席同我们国家领导人，社会活动家，将军和战士，文艺、教育、科学、宗教、工商界人士以及青年学生和少年儿童作了亲切的会见，还同北京人民一起欢度“五一”国际劳动节，参加了盛大的游园联欢。伏罗希洛夫主席这些访问活动以及同我国广泛阶层人民的会见，不仅给中国人民带来了伟大苏联人民的深厚友情，而且大大增进了彼此的互相了解，把我们中苏两国的传统友谊和伟大团结推向新的高峰。
    伏罗希洛夫主席同中国人民相处的日子虽然很短，但是，他的精神矍铄和老而益壮的体质，他的热情豪爽和谈笑风生的性格，他的亲切真挚和平易近人的态度，给中国人民留下了最深刻的难忘的印象。我们盟邦苏联元首同中国人民这种相处无间和亲同手足的情景，再一次向全世界显示了中苏两国人民牢不可破的团结和亲如兄弟的友谊。我们中国人民亲身体会到这种团结和友谊的重大意义，正像毛泽东同志所说的：“这种团结和友谊，不仅是我们两国社会主义和共产主义建设事业中的有利因素，而且也是社会主义各国团结的重要部分，也是世界和平和人类进步事业的可靠保证。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席在访问中国的日子里，在各方面给了我们巨大的鼓舞和支持。伏罗希洛夫主席对我们现在所进行的伟大社会主义建设事业，特别是对我们以优先发展重工业为基础的社会主义工业化政策，对我们通过合作化的农业社会主义改造，对我们用和平方式进行的资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，都给以很高的评价。伏罗希洛夫主席在他的几次演说中，重申苏联政府完全支持中国人民使台湾重新归还祖国的愿望，支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的要求。伏罗希洛夫主席一再强调巩固和发展中苏两国以及其他社会主义国家的友谊和全面合作，并热情地申明“苏联从来就是而且永远都是伟大的中国的朋友和弟兄”，今后将继续给我国以无私的援助。对伏罗希洛夫主席表达的伟大苏联对我国人民的这种真挚的关怀、友情和支持，我们表示深深的感谢。
    热爱和平、主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，是我们中苏两国外交政策的坚定不移的方针。因此，伏罗希洛夫主席有关维护世界和平和反对战争的崇高意愿，也是我们两国人民的共同意愿。中国人民永远记住伏罗希洛夫主席讲的警句：“我爱将军，但是，我反对战争”；“我举杯祝地球上所有的人生活在和平之中，不会想到战争，争取全世界的和平”。中国人民将永远同苏联和其他社会主义国家的人民一起，同世界一切爱好和平的人民一起，努力维护和平和人类的进步事业。
    我们敬祝伏罗希洛夫主席对印度尼西亚共和国的访问，将在加强苏联和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系方面，在促进亚洲和世界和平方面，获得重要的成就。
