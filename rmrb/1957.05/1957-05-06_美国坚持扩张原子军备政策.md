    The United States Persists in Expanding Its Atomic Arsenal Policy
    By Our Staff Commentator
    The North Atlantic Council meeting in Bonn has ended ahead of schedule. The communique issued after the meeting shows that some countries in the group, mainly the United States, are still trying to obstruct the improvement of East-West relations and continue to pursue a policy of expanding the atomic arsenal.

    The US policy of expanding its atomic arsenal has caused widespread concern and unease among people of all countries. Broad social forces, including those in many of the Western European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, oppose equipping the Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, especially West Germany, with atomic weapons, and demand an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. At the same time, the Soviet Union's efforts to improve international relations and promote the settlement of disarmament issues have been welcomed and valued by the people of all countries and public opinion in some Western European countries. This was the situation facing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization before the meeting, and this situation made the US ruling clique very uneasy.

    It is not just that. The US ruling clique and West German militarists are also very dissatisfied with Britain's decision to reduce the number of its armed forces and focus on developing nuclear weapons. The United States is afraid that other Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will follow Britain in reducing their armed forces; West German militarists are concerned that a Britain with nuclear weapons will put West Germany at a disadvantage in the struggle for leadership in Western Europe.

    The above situation not only shows that the US policy of expanding the atomic arsenal is very unpopular, that this policy has further deepened the contradictions between the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but also that this policy has put the Adenauer government, which is keen to equip the West German army with atomic weapons, in a very unpleasant situation.

    At the Bonn meeting, Dulles and Adenauer played a duet, maliciously slandering and attacking the Soviet Union on the just actions of the Soviet Union in assisting the Hungarian people in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and on the issue of German reunification. Their spreading of such anti-Soviet platitudes was obviously aimed at poisoning relations between Eastern and Western countries in order to force other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to continue to accept the US policy of expanding the atomic arsenal. At the same time, they also attempted to use this to ease the pressure from public opinion in various countries.

    As a result, the communique of the North Atlantic Council meeting, on the one hand, tried its best to distort the facts on the Hungarian incident and the German reunification issue, and on the other hand, still stated that it would enable the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to possess "the new types of weapons needed," that is, atomic weapons. However, the US and West German militarists are not without difficulties in this regard. They are particularly afraid that this policy will have an adverse impact on the Adenauer government's position in the upcoming general election. Therefore, West German Foreign Minister Brentano still tried to conceal after the publication of the meeting communique: the meeting did not discuss the issue of West German atomic armament. This "candidly admits the crime" approach will not fool anyone. The people of all countries, especially the people of West Germany, will never relax their struggle against the US policy of expanding the atomic arsenal.

    In addition to continuing to pursue the policy of expanding the atomic arsenal, the United States is also attempting to use the contradictions between the ruling groups of West Germany and some other Western European countries and Britain to force Britain to slow down its measures to reduce the number of its armed forces. However, Britain did not back down on this issue; the United States did not achieve its goal.

    The people of Western European countries, together with the people of other countries in the world, can no longer tolerate living under the threat of the atomic arms race. Their desire to ease East-West relations and achieve disarmament will certainly continue to grow. The US policy of expanding the atomic arsenal and creating tension is doomed to failure.

    美国坚持扩张原子军备政策
    本报评论员
    北大西洋集团理事会在波恩举行的会议已经提前结束了。会议所发表的公报表明，这个集团的一些国家，主要是美国，仍在竭力阻挠东西方关系的改善，并要继续推行扩张原子军备的政策。
    美国扩张原子军备的政策，已使各国人民普遍感到忧虑和不安。包括北大西洋集团的西欧成员国的许多国家的广泛社会力量，反对以原子武器装备北大西洋集团的西欧国家，特别是西德的军队，并且要求立即停止核武器的爆炸试验。同时，苏联为改善国际关系和促进裁军问题的解决而进行的努力，已受到各国人民和一些西欧国家社会舆论的欢迎和重视。这就是北大西洋集团开会前所面对的局势，而这种局势使美国统治集团十分不安。
    不止如此。美国统治集团和西德的军国主义分子，对英国裁减武装部队人数和着重发展核武器的决定也十分不满。美国害怕北大西洋集团的其他西欧国家效法英国而实行裁减武装部队；西德军国主义分子则担心一个拥有核武器的英国，会使西德在争夺西欧领导权的斗争中居于不利的地位。
    以上这些情况，不仅说明美国扩张原子军备的政策已十分不得人心，说明这种政策已使北大西洋集团国家之间的矛盾在进一步加深，而且说明这种政策也使热衷于以原子武器装备西德军队的阿登纳政府处于很不美妙的境地。
    在这次波恩会议上，杜勒斯和阿登纳如扮演双簧一样，在苏联援助匈牙利人民镇压反革命叛乱的正义行动和德国的统一问题上，一唱一和地对苏联进行恶意的诽谤和攻击。他们散布这种反苏滥调，显然是为了毒化东西方国家之间的关系，以便迫使其他北大西洋集团国家继续接受美国扩张原子军备的政策。同时，他们也企图借此来缓和各国社会舆论的压力。
    由于这样，北大西洋集团理事会会议的公报，一方面在匈牙利事件和德国统一问题上竭力颠倒黑白，另一方面则仍表示要使北大西洋集团国家拥有“所需要的新式武器”，也就是原子武器。但是，美国和西德军国主义分子在这方面并不是没有困难的。他们特别害怕这种政策会对阿登纳政府在未来的大选中的地位造成不利的影响。因此，西德外长勃伦塔诺在会议公报发表后仍然竭力掩饰说：会议没有讨论西德的原子军备问题。这种“此地无银三百两”的手法是骗不了人的。各国人民，特别是西德人民绝不会放松他们反对美国扩张原子军备政策的斗争。
    除了继续推行扩张原子军备政策之外，美国还企图利用西德和其他一些西欧国家统治集团和英国之间的矛盾，来迫使英国放缓它裁减武装部队人数的措施。但是，英国在这个问题上并没有退让；美国没有达到它的目的。
    西欧各国人民同世界其他各国人民，现在再不能忍受在原子军备竞赛的威胁下过日子了，他们要求缓和东西方的关系，实现裁减军备的愿望，是肯定还会继续增长的。美国扩张原子军备和制造紧张局势的政策，是终久要失败的。
