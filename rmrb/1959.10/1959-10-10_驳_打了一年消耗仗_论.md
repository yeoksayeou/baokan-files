Refuting the "One Year of Attrition" Theory
	Qian Mingsheng

In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our Hebei Province, like the rest of the country, achieved great victories in the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the people's commune movement. The broad masses of people were delighted and encouraged by these brilliant achievements, filled with vigor, and full of confidence, and are striving to achieve continued leaps forward this year.

Contrary to the spirit and ideological feelings of the broad masses, some right-leaning opportunists have launched vicious attacks on our great achievements, slandering us for having "fought a year of attrition" last year and "used up our old capital," attempting to fundamentally negate the achievements of the Great Leap Forward.

The main target of the right-leaning opportunists' attacks on the Great Leap Forward is the mass movement for iron and steel smelting and water conservancy construction. They say that the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting was "not worth the loss" or "more loss than gain," that the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting was "only concerned with quantity, not quality," and "taking steel as the key link, squeezed out everything else," and so on. They want to use these reasons to prove their fallacy of "fighting a year of attrition."

Was our province's Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting last year "not worth the loss"? We say that the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting over the past year are extremely great. First of all, the iron and steel industry has achieved high-speed development. Before a year ago, except for the Longyan Iron Factory, no other place in our province could produce a ton of iron. This was our "old capital." After a short year in 1958, we have changed from an almost "unarmed" backward state to one of the main iron-producing provinces in our country. From 1957 to 1958, our province's steel production increased from 460,000 tons to 1.04 million tons, an increase of 1.17 times, exceeding the highest annual output in the old China from 1890 to the national liberation (1943, including the Northeast occupied by Japanese imperialism, the national steel production was 920,000 tons); iron production increased five times in one year, from 120,000 tons to 720,000 tons. This is the road that the entire old China took twenty-five years to complete (1910 to 1935). Our province alone has traveled the road that old China took decades to travel in one year. How high is this speed!

Through the mass movement of Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting, our province's iron and steel industry has a more reasonable layout and a more complete system. A year ago, there was only one Longyan Iron Factory, but now we have established dozens of large and small iron smelting enterprises, forming an iron smelting industry with a considerable scale based on medium-sized blast furnaces and "small-scale foreign-style furnaces," scattered all over the province. In the past, the steel plants in our province were all located in Tianjin and Tangshan in the coastal area, while the Handan and Chengde areas, which are very rich in resources, did not produce an ounce of iron. Now we have started the construction of the Handan and Chengde iron and steel joint enterprises, and are transforming the Tianjin and Tangshan iron and steel enterprises. In the past, the production situation of the iron and steel industry in our province was that there were many mines but little iron, and the ore was transferred out, smelted into iron, and then the pig iron was transferred in to be smelted into steel. In the past, the pig iron for steel smelting in Tianjin and Tangshan was supplied by Shanxi, Shijingshan, and Benxi. Now we have basically achieved self-sufficiency, directly supplying the steel smelting industry in Tangshan and Tianjin and the machinery manufacturing industry in the province with our own iron, and no longer importing pig iron from the state.

This is the great change and great achievement that has taken place in the iron and steel industry in our province over the past year. It has not only achieved a great leap forward in the iron and steel industry, but also created extremely favorable material conditions for the continued high-speed development of the entire national economy in the future. Facts have proved that the principle of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward" is completely in line with the spirit of the General Line to carry out socialist construction at high speed. The right-leaning opportunists "have eyes but cannot see Mount Tai," and instead think it is "not worth the loss" or "more loss than gain." Thank goodness, if it is such a "loss," then we would rather do more such "loss-making business."

Is the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting "only concerned with quantity, not quality"? We say that from the very beginning of the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting last year, we have attached importance to both quantity and quality. In order for steel to be produced at high speed, we have adopted the principle of carrying out mass movements and "combining indigenous and foreign methods." On the one hand, we have established a large number of blast furnaces using indigenous methods, and on the other hand, we have also established a large number of small blast furnaces using foreign methods. From the perspective of product quality, of the 720,000 tons of pig iron produced last year, 540,000 tons were "foreign" iron and 180,000 tons were indigenous iron, and of the 1.04 million tons of steel, 670,000 tons were "foreign" steel and 370,000 tons were indigenous steel. Although indigenous iron and indigenous steel are of lower quality than foreign iron and foreign steel, they have played a huge role in supporting the development of industrial and agricultural production in our province. It has ensured the needs of both modern steel smelting industry and machinery manufacturing industry, and also guaranteed the needs of manufacturing agricultural tools in the countryside. A part of the indigenous iron has also been directly smelted into "foreign steel." Such a combination of "indigenous" and "foreign" methods has not only increased the quantity, but also improved the quality, breaking the situation in the past where only relying on foreign methods of production was limited in both quantity and quality, thereby obtaining the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel in 1958.

Regarding the relationship between quantity and quality, we dialectical materialists believe that qualitative change is caused by quantitative change. Without a considerable quantity, it is impossible to seek higher quality. Therefore, in the iron and steel movement, we have both grasped quantity and quality, improved quality on the basis of increasing quantity, and then further ensured a greater increase in quantity while improving quality. The development of the iron and steel movement in our province has been carried out according to such an objective law. When the iron smelting industry was almost a "blank sheet of paper," we prominently grasped quantity, sought quality from quantity, and greatly developed "small-scale indigenous furnaces" and "small-scale foreign-style furnaces." When "small-scale indigenous furnaces" and "small-scale foreign-style furnaces" have been established in large quantities, we have promptly put forward the policy of rectification, consolidation, and improvement, replacing "small-scale indigenous furnaces" with "small-scale foreign-style furnaces," and carried out a series of work such as fixed-point production, improved management, and improved technology. Therefore, the quality of pig iron has gradually improved since this year, and the pass rate of pig iron has now reached more than 82%, and the pass rate of converter steel has reached more than 96%. After consolidation and improvement, the "small-scale foreign-style furnace" iron smelting enterprises have not only greatly improved in quality, but also greatly improved in iron smelting production capacity. In the recent high-yield ten-day period, the highest daily pig iron production reached 7,522 tons, achieving a double leap forward in quantity and quality.

The development process of the iron and steel industry over the past year vividly illustrates that we have correctly grasped the dialectical relationship between quantity and quality, thereby achieving a great victory. The right-leaning opportunists attack us for "only caring about quantity, not quality," not because they attach importance to quality, but because they fundamentally oppose the policy of "walking on two legs" and oppose the high-speed advancement of the iron and steel industry.

Is it true that "taking steel as the key link, squeezed out everything else"? The answer is no. In 1958, due to the correct implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," the national economy of our province achieved an all-round Great Leap Forward. In 1958, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our province increased by 59.63% compared with 1957, which is equal to 3.7 times the average growth rate of the first five-year plan. In 1958, the output of raw coal increased by 66% compared with 1957, which is more than eight times the average growth rate of the first five-year plan; the power generation increased by 47%, which is more than two times the average growth rate of the first five-year plan; the machinery industry has had even greater development, especially the manufacturing capacity of heavy machinery and equipment has been greatly improved. In the past, we had not produced metallurgical equipment, but now we have been able to produce complete sets of medium and small metallurgical equipment; the light industry has also had a leap forward development. The output of cotton yarn increased by 58.52%, which is eleven times the average growth rate during the first five-year plan, and the output of machine-made paper increased by 36%, which is two times the average growth rate during the first five-year plan. Of course, in a short period of time, the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting also had some shortcomings, such as: affecting the coal supply and power supply of some departments, occupying more agricultural labor force, and so on. But these temporary, local, and quickly corrected shortcomings are only a small finger or even less than a small finger in the ten fingers compared with the all-round Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy.

The right-leaning opportunists also attacked that too many reservoirs were built in 1958, "with little benefit," meaning that it caused unwarranted "consumption." But the indisputable facts have proved that building reservoirs is not "of little benefit," but of great benefit. In 1958, the total agricultural output value of our province was 15.82 times higher than the average annual growth rate during the first five-year plan. The main reason for this is the construction of various water conservancy projects and the overcoming of drought and flood disasters. This is inseparable from the fact that the peasants, relying on the strength of the communes, moved mountains and seas and changed the law of spring drought and autumn floods in our province. It is worth writing about that six giant dams across the river rose in one year, forming six wide artificial lakes in the valleys upstream of the dams, with a total area of more than 300 square kilometers, controlling all the water sources in the more than 40,000 square kilometers upstream of the reservoir. This year, central and northern parts of our province experienced heavy rainstorms, and several flood peaks appeared in the rivers, but because the six major reservoirs blocked 4.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater, not only were the vast plains spared from flood disasters, but also ensured a greater agricultural production bumper harvest than the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Compared with the desolate scene of selling children and daughters everywhere in the major flood disaster in Hebei Province in 1939, it is really a world apart. At the same time, farmland water conservancy is also constantly achieving great victories. In 1958 alone, the irrigated area of the province increased by more than 50 million mu, of which more than 31 million mu benefited in the same year, equivalent to more than double the original irrigation area. After the communization, farmland water conservancy moved towards the mechanization of irrigation. By the first half of this year, the province had drilled more than 54,000 machine wells, with more than 539,000 horsepower of power machinery, and the mechanical irrigation area reached more than 8 million mu, nearly six times larger than in 1957. The people of the province used these water conservancy facilities to conquer the unprecedented drought in 1958 and 1959, and laid a strong material foundation for the future drought resistance struggle.

The right-leaning opportunists close their eyes and do not look at the glorious achievements of the Great Leap Forward, but they cling to some shortcomings that occurred in the Great Leap Forward. Some shortcomings have obviously been overcome long ago, and they are still exaggerating and rendering them. In this way, they have come to the wrong conclusion that the Great Leap Forward is "fighting a year of attrition" and shouted everywhere. What is their intention? This is not difficult to understand.

The right-leaning opportunists say that the achievements of the Great Leap Forward are "fighting a year of attrition." Fundamentally speaking, this is because they stand on the bourgeois position, look at various problems in the socialist revolution and construction, oppose the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," oppose the correct policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," and oppose the high-speed development of socialist construction. The cadres and the masses of people are full of energy and spirit, and act according to the Party's line and policies. When they work hard, the right-leaning opportunists are unhappy and do not agree. Therefore, they reverse black and white, say that the achievements are shortcomings, say that progress is a retreat, and say that the great achievements of the year are "fighting a year of attrition," attempting to use such means to loosen people's strength and vent people's anger, so as to achieve their goal of resisting and uglifying the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward. However, the facts cannot be distorted after all. The enlightened broad masses of laboring people who have created great achievements with their own hands will not be deceived. They will never slacken or lose their spirit because of the pessimistic and absurd arguments spread by the right-leaning opportunists. On the contrary, they will create more brilliant achievements on the road of advancement with greater leap forward steps, and completely smash the nonsense of the right-leaning opportunists!

    驳“打了一年消耗仗”论
    钱明生
    1958年，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，我们河北省和全国各地一样，取得了工农业大跃进和人民公社运动的伟大胜利。广大人民为这些光辉成就而欢欣鼓舞，干劲冲天，信心百倍，正在为实现今年的继续跃进而奋斗。
    与广大群众这种精神面貌和思想感情相反，一些右倾机会主义分子对我们的伟大成就却进行了恶毒的攻击，他们污蔑我们去年是“打了一年消耗仗”，是“啃了老本钱”，企图从根本上否定大跃进的成就。
    右倾机会主义分子攻击大跃进的主要矛头是指向大炼钢铁和兴修水利的群众运动。他们说大炼钢铁运动是“得不偿失”或“有失无得”，说大炼钢铁是“只顾数量，不顾质量”，“以钢为纲，挤掉了一切”等等。他们想以这些理由来证实其“打了一年消耗仗”的谬论。
    我省去年的大炼钢铁运动是不是“得不偿失”呢？我们说一年来大炼钢铁的成绩是极其伟大的。首先是钢铁工业获得了高速度的发展。一年以前，我省除了龙烟铁厂以外，其他地方是不能生产一吨铁的。这就是我们的“老本钱”。经过1958年短短一年的时间，我们已经从几乎“手无寸铁”的落后状况一变而为我国的主要产铁省份之一。从1957年到1958年，我省钢的产量由四十六万吨增到一百零四万吨，增长了一点一七倍，超过了旧中国从1890年到全国解放这五十九年中的最高年产量（1943年，包括日本帝国主义占领的东北在内，全国产钢九十二万吨）；铁的产量在一年内增长了五倍，从十二万吨增到七十二万吨。这是整个旧中国走了二十五年（1910年到1935年）才走完的路程。我们一个省，一年就走过了旧中国几十年走的道路，这是多么高的速度！
    经过大炼钢铁的群众运动，我省钢铁工业已经有了比较合理的布局和比较完整的体系。一年以前，只有一个龙烟铁厂，可是现在，我们已经建立起几十个大、小炼铁企业，形成了以中型高炉为骨干，以“小洋群”为基础的具有相当规模的炼铁工业，星罗棋布，遍布全省。过去我省的钢厂位置都在沿海地区的天津、唐山，而资源非常丰富的邯郸、承德地区却寸铁不产；现在我们已经开始了邯郸和承德两个钢铁联合企业的建设，并且正在改造天津、唐山的钢铁企业。过去我省钢铁工业的生产情况是矿多铁少，矿石外调，炼成了铁，然后再把生铁内调炼成钢。天津、唐山炼钢的生铁，过去都靠山西、石景山、本溪供应，现在我们已经基本做到自给自足，以自己炼的铁直接供应唐山、天津两地的炼钢工业和全省的机械制造行业，不再由国家调进生铁了。
    这就是我省一年来钢铁工业发生的伟大变化和取得的伟大成绩。它不仅取得了钢铁工业的大跃进，并为今后整个国民经济的继续高速度发展创造了极为有利的物质条件。事实证明“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针是完全符合总路线规定的高速度地进行社会主义建设的精神的。右倾机会主义分子“有眼不识泰山”，反而认为是“得不偿失”或“有失无得”。谢天谢地，如果是这样的“得不偿失”，那么我们宁愿更多的作些这样的“亏本生意”。
  大炼钢铁是不是“只顾数量，不顾质量”？我们说从去年大炼钢铁一开始，我们就是既重视数量又重视质量的。我们为了钢铁能够高速度地生产，采取了大搞群众运动和“土洋结合”的方针。一方面建立了大量的土法生产的高炉，同时也建立了大量的洋法生产的小高炉。从产品质量上看，去年生产的七十二万吨生铁中有五十四万吨“洋”铁，十八万吨土铁，一百零四万吨钢中有六十七万吨“洋”钢和三十七万吨土钢。土铁、土钢虽然比洋铁洋钢质量低一些，但这对支持我省工农业生产的发展，却发挥了巨大作用。它既保证了现代化的炼钢工业和机械制造业的需要，也保证了农村中制造农具的需要。一部分土铁并且直接炼成了“洋钢”。这样“土”“洋”结合，既增加了数量，又提高质量，打破了过去仅依靠洋法生产在数量和质量方面都受限制的局面，从而获得了1958年的钢铁大跃进。
    对待数量和质量的关系问题，我们辩证唯物主义者认为，质变是由量变引起的。没有相当的数量就无法求得更高的质量。因此，我们在钢铁运动中就既抓数量也抓质量，在增加数量的基础上提高质量，然后在质量提高的同时，进一步保证更大的数量的增加。我省钢铁运动的发展就是按照这样一个客观规律进行的。当炼铁工业还几乎是一张“白纸”的时候，我们突出地抓数量，从数量中求质量，大量地发展“小土群”和“小洋群”。而当“小土群”和“小洋群”已经大量地建立起来之后，我们又及时地提出了整顿巩固提高的方针，以“小洋群”代替了“小土群”，并且进行了定点，改进管理，提高技术等一系列工作。因而今年以来生铁质量逐步提高，现在生铁合格率已经达到了82％以上，转炉钢的合格率已经达到了96％以上。经过巩固、提高的“小洋群”炼铁企业，不仅质量有了很大提高，炼铁生产的能力也大大提高了，在最近的高产旬中日产生铁最高的一天达到七千五百二十二吨，实现了数量和质量的双跃进。
    一年来钢铁工业的发展过程，生动地说明了我们是正确地掌握了数量和质量的辩证关系，从而取得了巨大的胜利。右倾机会主义分子攻击我们“只顾数量，不顾质量”，并不是他们重视质量，而是根本反对“两条腿走路”的方针，反对钢铁工业的高速度前进。
    是不是“以钢为纲，挤掉了一切”呢？回答是否定的。1958年由于正确地执行了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，我省国民经济实现了全面的大跃进。1958年我省工农业总产值同1957年相比较，增长了59.63％，等于第一个五年计划平均增长速度的三点七倍。1958年比1957年原煤产量增长了66％，为第一个五年计划平均增长速度八倍多；发电量增长了47％，为第一个五年计划平均增长速度的二倍多；机械工业更有了巨大的发展，特别是重型机械设备的制造能力大大提高了，过去我们没有生产过冶金设备，现在我们已经能够成套地生产中小型冶金设备了；轻工业也有了飞跃的发展，棉纱产量增长了58.52％，为第一个五年计划期间平均增长速度的十一倍，机制纸，增长了36％，为第一个五年计划期间平均增长速度的两倍。当然，在一个短时期内，大炼钢铁运动也曾有过一些缺点，例如：影响了一些部门的煤炭供应和电量供应，多占了一些农业劳动力等。但是这些暂时的局部的而且很快就已纠正了的缺点，比起整个国民经济的全面大跃进，只不过是十个指头中一个小手指头甚至不到一个小手指头而已。
    右倾机会主义分子还攻击1958年水库搞的太多了，“受益很小”，意思是造成了无谓的“消耗”。但无可争辩的事实已经证明，修水库不是“受益很小”，而是受益很大。1958年我省农业总产值比第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度高十五点八二倍，其原因，主要的一条是兴修了各种水利工程，战胜了旱涝灾害。这是和农民群众凭借公社的力量，移山倒海，改变我省春旱秋涝的规律分不开的。值得大书特书的是六座拦河巨坝一年崛起，使大坝上游的山谷间形成六个宽阔的人工湖，总面积达三百多平方公里，把水库上游四万多平方公里的水源全部控制起来。今年我省中部和北部连降特大暴雨，各河先后出现数次洪峰，但是由于六大水库拦住了四十五亿立方米的洪水，不仅使广大平原地区免除洪水灾害，而且保证了比大跃进的1958年还大的农业生产大丰收。这和1939年河北省闹大水灾，到处是卖儿鬻女的荒凉景象比起来，实在是天上地下。同时，农田水利也在不断取得巨大胜利。只1958年全省水浇地即增加了五千多万亩，其中当年受益的三千一百多万亩，相当原来灌溉面积的一倍多。公社化后，农田水利又向灌溉机械化迈进。到今年上半年，全省已打机井五万四千多眼，拥有动力机械五十三万九千多马力，机械灌溉面积达到八百多万亩，比1957年扩大近六倍。全省人民利用这些水利设备，征服了1958年和1959年多少年所未有的干旱，并为今后的抗旱斗争奠定了强大的物质基础。
    右倾机会主义分子，闭眼不看大跃进的辉煌成就，而对大跃进中所发生的某些缺点，却死抓住不放，某些缺点明明早已经克服了，他们还在夸大渲染，这样，他们就得出了一个大跃进是“打了一年的消耗仗”的错误结论，到处叫嚷。他们用心何在？这是不难了解的。
    右倾机会主义分子，把大跃进的成就说成是“打了一年消耗仗”，从根本上说，这是由于他们站在资产阶级立场上，看待社会主义革命和建设中的各种问题，反对党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，反对“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的正确方针，反对高速度地发展社会主义建设事业。干部和人民群众干劲冲天、意气风发地按照党的路线、方针行动起来了，大干起来了，右倾机会主义分子不高兴，不赞成，因此就颠倒黑白，把成绩说成缺点，把前进说成后退，把一年的伟大成就，说成是“打了一年消耗仗”，企图以这样的手段，松人们的劲，泄人们的气，达到他们抵抗、丑化党的总路线和大跃进的目的。但是，事实终究是歪曲不了的。用自己的双手创造了伟大成就的、觉悟了的广大劳动人民，是不会受骗的，他们决不会因右倾机会主义分子所散布悲观荒谬论调而松劲、泄气，相反的，他们将用更大的跃进步伐，在前进道路上创造更光辉的成就，把右倾机会主义分子的谰言彻底粉碎！
