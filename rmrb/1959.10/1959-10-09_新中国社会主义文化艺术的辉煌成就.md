The Splendid Achievements of Socialist Culture and Art in New China
Minister of Culture, Shen Yanbing

Chairman Mao Zedong said at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably emerge." The tremendous development of cultural undertakings over the past decade has confirmed this great prediction.

Great Achievements Have Been Made in Cultural and Artistic Work Over the Past Decade

In these ten years, in coordination with the magnificent economic construction, large-scale cultural construction has been carried out. We have transformed some of the cultural facilities left over from old China according to the needs of the people, and at the same time established many new cultural undertakings; the broad masses of the people have begun to master culture and have carried out extensive and vigorous mass cultural activities; literary and art workers have undergone ideological remolding and labor training, greatly strengthened their ties with the working people, and improved their political and ideological level, and have created many excellent literary and artistic works; a strong cultural and artistic contingent armed with Marxism-Leninism has begun to take shape. The reason why cultural and artistic work has been able to achieve such great results is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the resolute implementation of the Party's cultural and artistic work policy by cultural and artistic departments at all levels and all cultural and artistic workers.

The cultural and artistic undertakings of New China serve the broad masses of the working people and aim to meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. Culture and art have become a powerful weapon for carrying out socialist and communist education for the broad masses of the people. During the Kuomintang rule, progressive culture was devastated; the working people were in a state of cultural backwardness for a long time; there were originally very few cultural undertakings, and only a part of the remaining cultural undertakings could not meet the needs of the working people at all. We have systematically reformed these old cultural undertakings, giving them new socialist ideological content, and transformed what was originally enjoyed by a few exploiting classes into tools for serving the broad masses of the people. At the same time, we have built a large number of various cultural institutions; new socialist cultural undertakings have developed unprecedentedly. Cultural centers, cultural stations, clubs, libraries, and film projection teams have spread all over the country's urban and rural areas and industrial and mining areas, forming a wide socialist cultural network. Newspapers, periodicals, publishing houses, theatrical troupes, theaters, and cinemas have all developed greatly. Let us compare the development figures of China's cultural undertakings in 1958 with those in 1936, the highest year of development of cultural undertakings in old China, and we can see the amazing development speed of cultural undertakings in New China. In 1958, there were 3,162 professional art performing groups in China, and 2,620 theaters across the country, an increase of more than four times and more than seven times respectively compared with 1936. In 1958, there were 12,579 film projection units, including 1,386 cinemas and 8,384 mobile film projection teams; there were no film projection teams at all before liberation, and the number of cinemas increased by more than three times compared with 1936. In 1958, there were 108 publishing houses in the country, which published 45,495 kinds of books in that year, with a circulation of more than 2.38 billion copies, 13 times more than in 1936. In 1958, there were 922 public libraries above the county level in the country, 18 times more than in 1936; there were 360 museums above the county level, 15 and a half times more than in 1936. Before liberation, most ethnic minority areas in our country had almost no cultural facilities. Now, the four ethnic autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia all have film studios and newspapers and publishing houses in ethnic minority languages. By the end of 1958, there were 1,559 film projection units, 11 ethnic publishing houses, and 656 bookstores in ethnic minority areas across the country. According to statistics from only four ethnic autonomous regions, there are 156 art performing groups, 89 theaters, 322 state-run cultural centers and cultural stations, and 50 public libraries. The phenomenon that cultural undertakings were monopolized by a few people and isolated from the broad masses of the working people has been fundamentally changed.

The liberated Chinese people have turned themselves over economically and politically and have become masters of the country, and they also demand to turn themselves over culturally and become masters of culture. With the improvement of their economic lives, the broad masses of the working people have gradually mastered cultural knowledge, and they are eager to use literature and art to express their labor and struggle. Over the past decade, mass cultural activities have been carried out vigorously under their demands and the leadership of the Party. In the early days of liberation, the masses expressed their joy of being liberated through various cultural activities, and then many amateur literary and art organizations, such as amateur theatrical troupes and creation groups, were established in industrial and mining areas and rural areas, and mass amateur literary and art activities closely combined with production were widely carried out. The great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 pushed mass cultural activities to a new climax. Millions of working people participated in various artistic creation and performance activities. They used songs, paintings, and especially new folk songs to express their soaring enthusiasm in overcoming difficulties and conquering nature in the process of building a new socialist life. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers created hundreds of millions of new folk songs, many of which embody the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and they powerfully inspired the production and struggle of the working people. Art originally originated from labor, and now, on a new ideological basis, it is once again combined with labor. Today, the artistic creation of the working people, inspired by socialist and communist ideas, can be said to be the budding of mass communist art.

Over the past decade, not only has great success been achieved in the construction of cultural and artistic undertakings and mass cultural activities, but the ranks of professional cultural and artistic workers have also greatly developed and improved. With the liberation of the whole country, the ranks of professional cultural and artistic workers have expanded unprecedentedly. This contingent has been tempered and transformed in various political and ideological struggles. Under the leadership of the Party, the cultural and artistic front has carried out continuous struggles against various anti-Marxist bourgeois literary and artistic ideas and has achieved victories. In particular, the rectification and anti-rightist movement in 1957 thoroughly crushed the attacks of rightist elements and revisionists, defended the Party's Marxist literary and artistic line, strengthened the Party's leadership over literature and art, and consolidated the unity of the literary and art circles. The vast majority of literary and art workers are becoming more and more closely united around the Party and are increasingly aware that their work is a part of the entire revolutionary cause led by the Party. The broad masses of literary and art workers have strengthened their ties with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many writers and artists have gone to the grassroots level for a long time to participate in work and live and labor with the masses. Many art groups have gone to factories and rural areas to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The long-term combination of literary and art workers with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in labor and struggle is the fundamental key to ensuring the healthy development of literary and artistic creation in our country.

The tempering of ideological struggle and the combination with the workers, peasants, and soldiers have greatly improved the ideological level of literary and art workers, and they have obtained rich sources of creation and strengthened their artistic ability to express the working people. Therefore, in all aspects of literature and art, a harvest of creations has been achieved. Many excellent works have been warmly welcomed by the vast number of readers. The sales volume of many novels has exceeded one million copies, and some excellent films have been watched by hundreds of millions of people. Reading newspapers, watching dramas, listening to music, and visiting art exhibitions have become an indispensable part of people's lives. Many works have shown significant improvements in ideology and artistry. These works depict the heroic figures in our country's long-term revolutionary struggle and the new people and new things in socialist construction. Many vivid artistic images have been familiar and loved by the vast number of readers. At the same time, writers and artists have strived to pursue the nationalization and popularization of their works, and have made great achievements in using mass language and creatively inheriting national traditions.

While developing new literary and artistic creations, we have also sorted out and inherited various excellent traditional arts and innovated them to better serve the needs of the new era and the people. The reform and development of Chinese opera is a prominent example. Chinese opera is a part of our country's rich national heritage and has a very wide audience. According to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" instructed by Chairman Mao Zedong, we have carried out the work of exploring, sorting out, and innovating Chinese opera art, so that some endangered opera genres have gained new life, long-buried opera genres have received due evaluation, and opera genres without formal troupes have established their own troupes. At the same time, some new opera genres that did not exist in the past have also emerged. When the first National Opera Festival was held in 1952, only more than 20 opera genres participated in the festival in Beijing; according to this year's statistics, there are already more than 360 opera genres. Many exciting and excellent repertoires, including traditional and modern themes, are constantly appearing on the stage, winning more and more audiences not only in China but also abroad. Performing artists are valued by the country and the people, and their ideological awareness and artistic level have been greatly improved. They realize their mission and the significance of the work they are engaged in, and therefore treat their artistic careers with greater enthusiasm and more serious and responsible attitude. Many famous veteran artists have joined the Party and become glorious Communist Party members. At the same time, a new generation is also growing rapidly under the Party's training and care. Many young actors have shown their outstanding artistic talents, which is very gratifying.

Over the past decade, cultural and artistic work has closely cooperated with the socialist revolution and socialist construction, encouraged the labor enthusiasm and fighting will of the broad masses of the people, improved the political consciousness and cultural level of the broad masses of the people, enriched the cultural life of the broad masses of the people, and played a great role in strengthening our own morale, destroying the enemy's prestige, uniting and educating the people, and打击和消灭敌人方面 (打击和消灭敌人方面 means attacking and eliminating the enemy but it sounds strange here). The achievements of our cultural and artistic work are great, and a great leap forward in culture and art has emerged since 1958. Over the past decade, we have accumulated a wealth of experience, and we must carefully summarize this experience. Now I would like to briefly talk about a few of my own experiences.

The Party's Leadership and Adherence to Putting Politics in Command are the Soul of All Cultural and Artistic Work

The Party's leadership over cultural and artistic work and adherence to putting politics in command in cultural and artistic work are the soul of all cultural and artistic work. If cultural and artistic work is divorced from the Party's leadership, it will inevitably make mistakes, inevitably become a prisoner of bourgeois ideology, and may become a tool used by hostile elements to carry out anti-people and anti-socialist activities. We know that culture and art are the superstructure of society. It either serves to consolidate the old economic base or to protect and promote the new economic base. Our culture and art serve the socialist economic base and are a part of the entire socialist revolution and socialist construction cause led by the Party. Without the Party's leadership, it will inevitably lose its role as the superstructure of the socialist base to maintain and promote the socialist economic base, and it will go to its opposite and will not be in line with the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the working people it leads. The bourgeoisie and the rightists among the bourgeois intellectuals stubbornly oppose the Party's leadership, and their purpose is to turn culture and art from a tool for serving the proletariat and socialism into a tool for serving the bourgeoisie. We resolutely fought back their attacks and defended the Party's leadership in cultural and artistic work. In particular, after the victory of the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, we thoroughly exposed and defeated the rightists, and the Party's leadership in cultural and artistic work was further consolidated, which created better conditions for the further development and prosperity of socialist culture and art, and opened up the road for the great leap forward in cultural and artistic undertakings in 1958.

In order to defend and implement the Party's leadership in cultural and artistic work, we have emphasized "putting politics in command" in all cultural and artistic work, requiring our culture and art to clearly and firmly serve the politics of the proletariat, to correctly reflect and actively promote the development of socialist economy and politics, and to launch a struggle against anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois ideology. Therefore, we must first understand the political situation, stand firm on the correct political position, and observe and consider problems from the correct political point of view, that is, from the point of view of representing the interests of thousands of masses, and use the correct method to reflect life and deal with problems. And the most fundamental key to realizing putting politics in command is that all cultural and artistic work and cultural and artistic workers must closely rely on and accept the leadership of the Party.

Of course, all other characteristics of cultural and artistic work must also be valued. We must strive to understand and master all the inherent internal connections of culture and art and the various laws of cultural and artistic work. Each of us must study our own business and be familiar with our own business. But the reason why it is necessary to do so is to rely on and use these objective laws and business knowledge of art itself to promote culture and art to serve socialism more effectively, to serve the working people, and to better play its political role, and not for business for business' sake, let alone for personal fame and fortune.

Defending the Party's leadership and adhering to putting politics in command prevents cultural and artistic work from being eroded by bourgeois ideology, which naturally puts the task of ideological remolding in front of cultural and artistic workers. Chairman Mao Zedong once said: "The final division between revolutionary or non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their final division is only at this point, and it does not matter what they say about the Three People's Principles or Marxism" ("May Fourth Movement"). In the process of ideological remolding of the cultural and artistic contingent over the years, we have increasingly deeply realized the great significance of the policy of combining intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Cultural and Artistic Work Must Serve the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and Serve Socialism

Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942 systematically and profoundly solved a series of major principled issues in literary and artistic ideology, mainly the issue of literature and art serving the masses and the issue of how literature and art serve the masses. And the main key to solving these two problems is the combination of literary and art workers with the workers and peasants.

We know that after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the literary and art workers in the liberated areas at that time responded to the Party's call, went deep into the masses, rushed to the front lines, and actively implemented the policy of combining with the workers and peasants, thus opening up a new period for the revolutionary literary and art movement in the liberated areas at that time. Literary and artistic creation and mass cultural activities flourished. It can be said that the policy of combining literary and art workers with the workers and peasants initially showed its strong vitality in large-scale practice.

The liberation of the whole country opened up broad avenues for the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants in our country. Over the past decade, the Party and the government have made full use of this favorable condition, especially after the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, adapted to the situation of the great leap forward, mobilized a large number of cultural and artistic workers to go deep into the rural areas and industrial and mining areas to carry out labor training; organized a large number of professionals to go to the mountains, go to the countryside, and go to the company to carry out roving performances and exhibitions; and organized a large number of creators to go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers to absorb creative nutrients. They participated in production labor and actual struggle with the masses, their ties with the masses became closer, and their thoughts and feelings also underwent fundamental changes.

The combination of intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers is also the key to the combination of theory and practice, the combination of culture and the masses, and the combination of popularization and improvement. This is the fundamental way to transform intellectuals, the fundamental way to build a proletarian cultural and artistic contingent, and also the fundamental way to prosper literary and artistic creation. We must resolutely implement this policy.

Socialist cultural and artistic undertakings are the cause of millions of masses themselves, not a cause that can be privately owned by a few people, nor a cause that can be monopolized by a few people. Cultural and artistic work, like all other work, must follow the mass line.

The fact that the broad masses of the people in our country have long been in a state of lack of culture is caused by the long-term oppression, exploitation, and backward state of production suffered by the broad masses of the people, and the backwardness of culture, in turn, seriously hinders the rapid improvement of productivity. After the people became the masters of the country, they urgently demanded to change this historically remaining state. They not only demanded to completely turn themselves over economically, but also demanded to completely turn themselves over culturally. The cultural revolution is the urgent demand of the broad masses of the people in our country. Without a wide and in-depth mass movement, without fully mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the creation of culture and art, and without arousing the masses' consciousness to liberate themselves culturally, it is impossible to realize the task of the great cultural revolution.

The facts of the past decade show that whenever the political movement is surging, the mass cultural movement also surges accordingly. The great leap forward in culture during the period of the all-round great leap forward and the people's commune in 1958 is even more obviously the result of the close combination of the vigorous cultural revolution movement and the vigorous social revolution movement. This proves that cultural workers must be good at mobilizing the masses and good at carrying out work in the mass movement.

Of course, adhering to the mass line in cultural and artistic work does not mean ignoring the role of experts. It is very necessary to trust experts and give full play to the enthusiasm of experts. The experts in the cultural and artistic circles are the country's valuable wealth, and we must unite all experts who are willing to contribute their strength to the motherland, so that they can fully play their role in socialist cultural construction. However, all experts must combine with the masses and learn from the masses. They must first be primary school students of the masses before they can become the expressers, spokespersons, and instructors of the masses. If experts are divorced from the masses, they will become "commanders without soldiers", and at the same time they will inevitably lose their way, lose the noble goal of serving the people, and thus form their own malnutrition, incomplete development, and gradually become a sick person. This is very harmful to the cause of the masses and to the experts themselves. To closely combine experts with the masses is also a part of the mass line.

In cultural work, we must resolutely oppose the right-leaning conservative ideas of ignoring the masses and belittling the masses. At the same time, when mobilizing the masses, we must pay attention to abiding by the principles of mass needs and mass voluntariness. And we should not replace the needs of the masses according to our own wishful thinking, because that would make the work superficial and unsuccessful. All work cannot violate this principle, and cultural and educational work to improve the thinking of the masses is an extremely meticulous work that can only take effect through the consciousness of the masses, and it must not violate the principle of the needs and voluntariness of the masses.

The Prosperity of Cultural and Artistic Work is the Result of Implementing the Party's Policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

The prosperity of cultural and artistic work in New China over the past decade is the result of implementing the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend".

Our culture and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialism. This is the direction that all cultural and artistic workers in our country should jointly follow. In order to effectively realize this direction, the Party has put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend". This policy is the best policy for mobilizing all the active forces of cultural and artistic workers and giving play to the strengths of various art forms to serve a common political purpose. Only by promoting full and free debate on various different academic views and full and free competition on various different art forms and styles can socialist culture and art flourish smoothly.

Facts have proved that the Party's policy is completely correct. It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that our literary and artistic garden can achieve such a situation of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color. In our country, all cultural and art that are beneficial to the people and beneficial to the socialist cause can be given full development conditions, various art schools are supported, and various artists can fully play their talents.

The bourgeoisie vainly attempted to use this policy to pass off poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers, which we had already learned before the rectification and anti-rightist struggle. This situation will still exist before the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated. Not recognizing this point, or thinking that advocating letting a hundred flowers bloom can coexist peacefully with poisonous weeds without weeding them out, is a right-leaning erroneous viewpoint. However, not allowing poisonous weeds to show their heads, or being alarmed when poisonous weeds are discovered, so that one doubts the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", is a naive idea that does not understand social reality and does not understand the laws of class struggle. We know that poisonous weeds objectively exist and have a certain social foundation. If we do not let them show their heads, they will still do evil in secret. And if we let them grow out, it will not only be easy to weed them out, but also use this to educate the masses and improve the masses' ability to resist poison. The truth of Marxism can only be tempered and developed in struggle. We cannot imagine an environment of peaceful construction of socialist culture and art without any struggle. The idea of fearing free debate and free competition is an idea that violates dialectics and violates the Party's policy, which is very harmful to the construction of socialist culture and art.

After several years of practice, the understanding of this policy by cultural and artistic workers in our country has gradually deepened, and some of the one-sidedness and incompleteness in the implementation of the policy have been overcome, which is extremely beneficial to creating a more prosperous situation for cultural and artistic work in our country.

The tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived. Ten years is a very short time in the history of human development, but our young socialist motherland is leaping forward. The cultural and artistic work of New China, like other work, has achieved great success. This is the great victory of the Party's cultural and artistic policy. It is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which creatively combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. In celebrating the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our cultural and artistic circles, together with the people of the whole country, are rejoicing and celebrating with the results of our labor, offering gifts to the great motherland and the great Party. We assure the motherland and the Party that we will continue to work under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line, go all out, aim high, and build socialist culture and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We will draw the newest and most beautiful pictures and write the newest and most beautiful poems in order to be worthy of our great and glorious motherland!

    新中国社会主义文化艺术的辉煌成就
    文化部部长　沈雁冰
    毛泽东主席在1949年中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上说过：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”十年来文化事业的巨大发展证实了这个伟大的预言。
    十年来，文化艺术工作取得了伟大的成就
    在这十年中，配合宏伟的经济建设，进行了大规模的文化建设。我们对旧中国遗留下来的一些文化设施按照人民的需要进行了改造，同时建立了许多新的文化事业；广大人民开始掌握了文化，开展了广泛的生气勃勃的群众文化活动；文艺工作者经历了思想改造和劳动锻炼，大大加强了同劳动人民的联系，提高了政治思想水平，创造了许多优秀的文学艺术作品；一支以马克思列宁主义武装起来的坚强的文化艺术队伍已经开始形成了。文化艺术工作所以能够得到这样巨大的成绩，是由于党的正确领导，由于各级文化艺术部门和全体文化艺术工作者坚决地执行了党的文化艺术工作的方针。
    新中国的文化艺术事业是为广大劳动人民服务的，是以满足广大群众的文化要求为目的的。文化艺术已经成为对广大人民进行社会主义、共产主义教育的强大武器。在国民党统治时期，进步文化遭受摧残；劳动人民长期陷于文化落后的状态；文化事业本来就少得可怜，而残留下来的仅有一部分文化事业，根本不能适应劳动人民的需要。我们对这些旧的文化事业进行了有步骤的改革，使它们具有新的社会主义的思想内容，并且把本来由少数剥削阶级所享受的东西，变成为广大人民服务的工具。同时我们新建了大量的各种文化机构；新的社会主义的文化事业有了空前的发展。文化馆、文化站、俱乐部、图书馆、电影放映队已经遍布全国的城乡和工矿区，形成了一个广泛的社会主义的文化网。报刊、出版社、剧团、剧场、电影院，都有很大的发展。让我们把1958年我国文化事业同旧中国文化事业发展数字最高的1936年作一个比较，就可以看出新中国文化事业的惊人的发展速度。1958年我国各种专业的艺术表演团体达到三千一百六十二个，全国剧场达到二千六百二十个，前者比1936年增加四倍多，后者比1936年增加七倍多。电影放映单位在1958年达到一万二千五百七十九个，其中电影院一千三百八十六个，流动的电影放映队八千三百八十四个；在解放前根本没有电影放映队，而电影院比1936年增加了三倍多。1958年全国出版社有一百零八家，这一年出版了图书四万五千四百九十五种，印行二十三亿八千多万册，印数比1936年多十三倍。1958年全国县以上的公共图书馆达到九百二十二个，比1936年多十八倍；县以上的博物馆达到三百六十个，比1936年多十五倍半。解放以前，我国大多数少数民族地区几乎没有什么文化设施。现在，内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏四个民族自治区都有了电影制片厂，有了民族文字的报纸和出版社。到1958年底，全国少数民族有电影放映单位一千五百五十九个，民族出版社十一个，书店六百五十六个。仅据四个民族自治区的统计，有艺术表演团体一百五十六个，剧场八十九个，国家举办的文化馆、文化站三百二十二个，公共图书馆五十个。文化事业被少数人垄断并与广大劳动人民隔离的现象已经根本改变了。
    解放了的中国人民，在经济上和政治上翻了身，成了国家的主人，他们也要求在文化上翻身，作文化的主人。广大劳动人民随着自己的经济生活的改善，也逐渐掌握了文化知识，他们迫切地要求运用文学艺术来表现他们的劳动和斗争。十年来，群众的文化活动，就在他们的这种要求和党的领导下蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。解放初期，群众就通过各种文化活动，表现自己得到了解放的欢乐，接着在工矿区和农村成立了很多业余文艺组织，如业余剧团、创作小组等，普遍开展了密切同生产结合的群众业余文艺活动。1958年的工农业大跃进，更把群众文化活动推上了一个新的高潮。千百万劳动群众参加了各种艺术的创作和表演活动。他们用歌咏，用绘画，特别是用新的歌谣，表现了他们在建设社会主义新生活过程中克服困难、战胜自然的冲天干劲。广大工人、农民和战士们创作了亿万首的新民歌，其中许多作品，体现了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义精神的结合，它们有力地鼓舞了劳动人民的生产和斗争。艺术本来起源于劳动，现在在新的思想基础上，又重新和劳动结合起来。今天被社会主义共产主义思想所鼓舞的劳动人民的艺术创作，可以说是群众共产主义艺术的萌芽。
    十年来，不仅文化艺术事业的建设和群众文化活动取得了很大的成绩，专业文化艺术工作者的队伍也有很大的发展和提高。随着全国的解放，专业文化艺术工作者的队伍空前扩大了。这支队伍在各种政治思想斗争中得到了锻炼和改造。在党的领导下，文化艺术战线上同各种反马克思主义的资产阶级文艺思想进行了不断的斗争，并且取得了胜利，特别是1957年整风反右，彻底粉碎了右派分子和修正主义者的进攻，保卫了党的马克思主义文艺路线，加强了党对文艺的领导，巩固了文艺界的团结。绝大多数文艺工作者越来越紧密地团结在党的周围，越来越认识到自己的工作是党所领导的整个革命事业的一部分。广大文艺工作者加强了同工农群众的联系，许多作家和艺术家长期到基层去参加工作，同群众一起生活和劳动。很多艺术团体下厂下乡为工农群众演出。文艺工作者在劳动和斗争中同工农群众长期结合，是保证我国文艺创作健康发展的根本关键。
    思想斗争的锻炼，同工农群众的结合，使文艺工作者大大提高了自己的思想水平，并且获得了丰富的创作源泉，加强了表现劳动人民的艺术能力。因此，在文学艺术各方面，都取得了创作的丰收。许多优秀的作品得到了广大读者的热烈欢迎。不少长篇小说销数在一百万册以上，有些优秀的影片观众达一亿几千万人次。阅读书报，看戏，听音乐，参观美术展览，已成为人民生活中不可缺少的部分。许多作品，在思想性和艺术性上都有显著的提高。这些作品描写了我国长期革命斗争中的英雄人物和社会主义建设中的新人新事，不少生动的艺术形象，已为广大读者所熟悉和热爱。同时，作家、艺术家们努力追求作品的民族化和群众化，在运用群众语言和创造性地继承民族传统上面，也取得了很大的成就。
    在发展新的文艺创作的同时，我们还整理和继承了各种优秀的传统艺术，并且加以革新，使它们更好地为新的时代和人民的需要服务。我国戏曲的革新和发展就是一个突出的例子。戏曲是我国丰富的民族遗产的一部分，拥有极广大的观众。我们根据毛泽东主席所指示的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，对戏曲艺术进行了发掘、整理和革新创造的工作，使一些接近灭亡的剧种获得新的生命，长期被埋没的剧种得到应有的评价，没有正式剧团的剧种建立了自己的剧团，同时还出现了好些过去所没有的新的剧种。1952年举行第一次全国戏曲汇演时，到北京参加汇演的只有二十多个剧种；根据今年的统计，已经达到三百六十多个剧种了。许多激动人心的优秀的剧目，包括传统的和现代题材的，经常不断地在舞台上出现，不但在中国而且在外国赢得了愈来愈多的观众。表演艺术家受到国家和人民的重视，他们的思想觉悟和艺术水平大大提高了，他们认识到自己的使命和自己所从事的工作的意义，因而也就用更大的热情和更严肃认真的态度去对待自己的艺术事业了。好些著名的老艺术家加入了党，成了光荣的共产党员。同时，新的一代，也在党的培养和关怀下，迅速地成长起来了，不少年轻的演员，已经表现出他们的优异的艺术才能，这是十分可喜的事情。
    十年来的文化艺术工作，密切地配合了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，鼓舞了广大群众的劳动热情和斗争意志，提高了广大群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，丰富了广大群众的文化生活，在长自己志气，灭敌人威风，团结和教育人民，打击和消灭敌人方面，发挥了很大的作用。我们的文化艺术工作的成绩是巨大的，1958年以来更出现了文化艺术上的大跃进。十年来，我们积累的经验是十分丰富的，对于这些经验，我们还要仔细地加以总结。现在我想简单地谈几点自己的体会。
    党的领导和坚持政治挂帅，是一切文化艺术工作的灵魂
    党对于文化艺术工作的领导和在文化艺术工作中坚持政治挂帅，这是一切文化艺术工作的灵魂。文化艺术工作如果脱离了党的领导，就必然会犯错误，必然会成为资产阶级思想的俘虏，并且可能成为被敌对分子利用来进行反人民、反社会主义的工具。我们知道，文化艺术是社会的上层建筑，它不是为巩固旧的经济基础服务，就是为保护和促进新的经济基础服务。我们的文化艺术是为社会主义的经济基础服务的，是党所领导的整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的一部分，离开了党的领导，就必然会失去它的作为社会主义基础的上层建筑而维护和促进社会主义经济基础的作用，就会走到它的反面，就不可能符合无产阶级和它所领导的广大劳动人民的利益。资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中的右派顽强地反对党的领导，其目的就是要使文化艺术由为无产阶级、为社会主义服务的工具变成为资产阶级服务的工具。我们坚决反击了他们的进攻，保卫了党在文化艺术工作中的领导。特别是经过1957年的反右派斗争，我们把右派分子彻底揭露和击败了，党在文化艺术工作中的领导更加巩固了，这就为社会主义文化艺术的进一步发展繁荣创造了更好的条件，为1958年文化艺术事业的大跃进开辟了道路。
    为了保卫和贯彻文化艺术工作中党的领导，我们在一切文化艺术工作中强调了“政治挂帅”，要求我们的文化艺术必须明确地坚定地为无产阶级的政治服务，必须正确地反映和积极促进社会主义的经济、政治的发展，必须对反党、反社会主义的资产阶级思想展开斗争。因此，我们从事文化艺术工作，首先必须洞察政治形势，站稳正确的政治立场，从正确的政治观点，即从代表千万群众的利益的观点来观察问题、考虑问题，并且用正确的方法来反映生活、处理问题。而实现政治挂帅的最根本关键，就是各项文化艺术工作和文化艺术工作者必须紧紧地依靠和接受党的领导。
    当然，文化艺术工作的其他一切特点，也必须加以重视。凡是文化艺术所固有的各种内部联系，文化艺术工作的各项规律，我们都要努力去认识和掌握它们。我们每个人都必须钻研自己的业务，熟识自己的业务。但是其所以必须如此，是为了依靠和运用这些艺术本身的客观规律和业务知识来促使文化艺术更加有效地为社会主义服务，为劳动人民服务，使文化艺术更好地发挥它的政治作用，而决不是为业务而业务，更不是为了个人的名利。
    保卫党的领导和坚持政治挂帅，使文化艺术工作不受资产阶级思想的侵蚀，这就很自然地在文化艺术工作者的面前提出了一个思想改造的任务。毛泽东主席曾经说过这样的话：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点，而不在乎口讲什么三民主义或马克思主义”（“五四运动”）。在文化艺术队伍多年来的思想改造过程中，我们越来越深刻地体会到知识分子和工农兵结合这个方针的伟大意义。
    文化艺术工作必须为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务
    毛泽东主席1942年在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，系统地和深刻地解决了文艺思想方面的一系列的重大原则性问题，主要的是一个文艺为群众的问题和一个文艺如何为群众的问题。而解决这两个问题的主要关键，就是文艺工作者和工农群众相结合。
    我们知道，延安文艺座谈会以后，当时各解放区的文艺工作者，纷纷响应党的号召，深入群众，奔赴前线，积极地实行了和工农群众结合的方针，这样就给当时解放区的革命文艺运动开辟了一个新时期。文艺创作和群众文化活动蓬勃开展。这可以说是文艺工作者和工农群众结合的方针初次在大规模的实践中显露出它的强大的生命力。
    全国解放给我国知识分子和工农群众结合开辟了广阔的道路。十年来党和政府充分利用了这一有利条件，特别在1957年整风反右派斗争胜利以后，适应大跃进的形势，动员了大批文化艺术工作者深入农村和工矿区，进行劳动锻炼；组织了大批专业人员上山、下乡、下连队，进行巡回演出和展出；组织了大批创作人员深入工农兵、吸取创作养料。他们和群众一道参加生产劳动和实际斗争，他们和群众的联系更加密切了，他们的思想感情也发生了根本的变化。
    知识分子和工农群众相结合，也就是理论和实践相结合、文化和群众相结合、普及和提高相结合的关键。这是改造知识分子的根本道路，是建立一支无产阶级的文化艺术队伍的根本道路，也是繁荣文学艺术创作的根本道路。我们必须坚决贯彻执行这个方针。
    社会主义的文化艺术事业是千百万群众自己的事业，不是少数人所得而私、也不是少数人所能包办的事业。文化艺术工作和其他各项工作一样，必须走群众路线。
    我国广大人民长期处于缺少文化的状况，这是由于广大人民长期遭受压迫、剥削和生产的落后状况所造成的，而文化的落后，又反过来严重妨碍生产力的迅速提高。人民成为国家的主人翁以后，迫切要求改变这种历史的残留的状况，他们不仅要求在经济上彻底翻身，也要求在文化上彻底翻身。文化革命是我国广大人民迫切的要求。没有广泛而深入的群众运动，不充分地发动广大群众起来参与文化艺术的创造，不激发群众在文化上自己解放自己的自觉，要实现伟大的文化革命的任务是不可能的。
    十年来的事实表明，凡是政治运动高涨的时候，群众的文化运动也随之而高涨。1958年全面大跃进和人民公社化时期的文化大跃进，更明显的是轰轰烈烈的文化革命运动和轰轰烈烈的社会革命运动两者密切结合的结果。这证明了文化工作者必须善于发动群众和善于在群众运动中开展工作。
    当然，坚持文化艺术工作中的群众路线，决不是忽视专家的作用。信任专家，充分发挥专家的积极性，这是十分必要的。文化艺术界的专家是国家的宝贵财富，我们必须团结一切愿意为祖国贡献出自己力量的专家，使他们在社会主义文化建设中充分发挥其作用。但是，一切专家必须和群众结合，必须向群众学习，要先当群众的小学生，然后才能成为群众的表现者、代言人和指导员。专家如果脱离了群众，他们就成了“无兵司令”，同时也必然会迷失方向，失去为人民服务的高尚目标，因而形成本身的营养不良，发育不全，渐渐成为一员病号。这是对群众事业、对专家本身都十分有害的。使专家同群众密切结合，这也是群众路线的一部分。
    在文化工作中，我们必须坚决反对忽视群众、轻视群众的右倾保守思想，同时在发动群众的时候，又必须注意遵守群众需要和群众自愿的原则。而不应该根据自己想当然的需要来代替群众的需要，因为那样就会使工作流于形式而得不到成功。一切工作都不能违背这个原则，而提高群众思想的文化教育工作，更是必须通过群众的自觉才能发生作用的十分细致的工作，是决不能违背群众的需要和自愿的原则的。
    文化艺术工作的繁荣昌盛是执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的结果
    十年来新中国文化艺术工作的繁荣昌盛，是执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的结果。
    我们的文化艺术必须为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务。这是我国一切文化艺术工作者应该共同遵循的方向。为要有效地实现这个方向，党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。这个方针是调动一切文化艺术工作者的积极力量和发挥各种艺术形式的特长来为一个共同的政治目的服务的最好的方针。只有促使各种不同的学术见解充分进行自由争论，各种不同的艺术形式和风格充分进行自由竞赛，社会主义的文化艺术才能顺利地繁荣昌盛起来。
    事实证明，党的这个方针是完全正确的。正是由于执行了这个方针，我们的文艺园地里，才能达到这样百花盛开、万紫千红的局面。在我们的国家，凡是有利于人民、有利于社会主义事业的文化艺术，都可以得到充分发展的条件，各种艺术流派都得到扶植，各种艺术家都可以充分发挥他们的才能。
    资产阶级妄想利用这个方针以毒草来冒充香花出现，这在整风反右派斗争以前我们已经领教过了。在资产阶级没有最后消灭以前，这种情况还是会有的。不认识到这一点，或者以为主张百花齐放就可以和毒草和平共处，不加锄除，这是一种右倾的错误观点。但是，不许毒草露头，或者发现了毒草就大惊小怪，以致对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针也怀疑起来，这是不懂社会实际、不懂阶级斗争规律的幼稚想法。我们知道，毒草是客观存在的，是有一定的社会基础的，不让它露头，它仍然会在暗中作恶，而让它长出来了，不但便于锄除，而且可以借此教育群众，提高群众的抗毒能力。马克思主义的真理只有在斗争中才能得到锻炼和发展。我们不可能设想有一种毫无斗争而平静地建设社会主义文化艺术的环境。那种害怕自由辩论和自由竞赛的思想，是一种违反辩证法、违反党的方针的思想，这对社会主义文化艺术的建设是很有害的。
    经过几年来的实践，我国文化艺术工作者对这个方针的认识已经逐步深刻化，克服了执行方针中的某些片面性和不彻底性，这对创造我国文化艺术更加繁荣昌盛的局面是极其有利的。
    中华人民共和国成立十周年了。十年，在人类发展史上是很短的时间，而我们年轻的社会主义祖国却在飞跃地前进着。新中国的文化艺术工作，也像其他工作一样取得了伟大的成就。这是党的文化艺术方针的伟大胜利。是创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在庆祝伟大的建国十周年的时候，我们文化艺术界和全国人民一道，欢欣鼓舞，以自己劳动的成果向伟大的祖国、伟大的党献礼。我们向祖国、向党保证，我们将继续在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的文化艺术。我们要画出最新最美的图画，写出最新最美的诗篇，以求无愧于我们的伟大光荣的祖国！
