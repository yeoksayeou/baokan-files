    Man and the Sun
    Xizao
    The sun emits enormous heat energy, radiating it to the entire earth, bringing warmth to people.
    According to the law of heat radiation, the sun transmits heat energy to people, and people also transmit the heat energy they emit to the sun, because they both radiate heat.
    However, according to calculations, the heat that the sun transmits to the human body is tens of millions of times greater than the heat that the human body transmits to the sun, just as the warmth the Party gives us is tens of millions of times greater than our contribution to the Party.

    人和太阳
    西早
    太阳，发出巨大无比的热能，辐射到整个大地，使人们得到温暖。
    按辐射传热定律，太阳把热能传给人们，人们也要把自己发出来的热能传给太阳，因为彼此都放出辐射热。
    但是，根据计算，太阳传给人体的热，要比人体传给太阳的热大上千万倍，正好像党给我们温暖要比我们对党的贡献大上千万倍一样。
