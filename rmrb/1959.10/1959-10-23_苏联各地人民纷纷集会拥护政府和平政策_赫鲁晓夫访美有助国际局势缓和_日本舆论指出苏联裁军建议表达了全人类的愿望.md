Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: According to TASS reports, the Soviet people are generally welcoming the results of Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev's visit to the United States. In recent days, working people in various regions have held various gatherings on the results of Khrushchev's visit to the United States. In their speeches or resolutions, they also emphasized that the plan for complete and thorough disarmament proposed by Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly fully conforms to the wishes of the people of all countries.

    A resolution was adopted at a meeting held at the "Compressor" factory in Moscow. The resolution said that the achievements of Khrushchev's lofty mission to the United States make us more confident that war can be avoided and that the people of the world can and should live in peace and friendship like harmonious neighbors.

    At the workers' conference of the Kirov Spinning Spindle United Factory in Leningrad, electrician Suchkov said in his speech that Khrushchev's visit to the United States helped to ease international tensions. The speech by the head of the Soviet government at the United Nations General Assembly has stumped many supporters of the "Cold War." The Western countries should now answer the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

    A resolution was adopted at the workers' conference of the "Red Excavator" factory in Kiev. The resolution said that Khrushchev's visit to the United States once again convinced people that the Soviet Union is the vanguard in the struggle for peace.

    Latvian chemist Academician Kalnin said that in order to ensure the safety of the people of all countries and the long-term peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems, complete and thorough disarmament must be achieved. He said that Khrushchev's proposal on this issue at the United Nations is a comprehensive and concrete plan, and its historical significance is inestimable.

    The Baku Oil Machinery Manufacturing Plant also held a general staff meeting to discuss the results of the Soviet government leader's visit to the United States. Senior engineer Gazhiyev said that only complete and thorough disarmament is a resolute measure to rid mankind of the threat of a new world war forever. We should compete with the Americans at the lathe, on the construction site, and in the fields, not in a bloodbath filled with gunpowder.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: "Asahi Weekly" recently published an article saying that the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev pointed out the way to eliminate the threat of atomic war.

    The article, written by Watanabe Seiki, a member of the "Asahi Shimbun" editorial board, said that Khrushchev's proposal not only demonstrates the ideal of the whole world, but also clearly points out the way to achieve complete disarmament.

    After explaining the proposal in detail, Watanabe Seiki said that the West has no reason to oppose the proposal for gradual disarmament. He also said that the West should not laugh it off.

    Famous reporter Iwatate Ichiro and two other writers wrote articles in the monthly magazine "Chuo Koron" to welcome Khrushchev's proposal. They all believe that this proposal is a realistic plan that contains the wishes of all mankind.

    日本舆论指出苏联裁军建议表达了全人类的愿望
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联人民普遍欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问美国的成果。最近几天，各地劳动人民都就赫鲁晓夫访美结果举行了各种集会。他们在发言或决议中还着重指出，赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会上所提出的全面彻底裁军的计划完全符合各国人民的愿望。
    在莫斯科“压缩器”工厂举行的大会上通过了一项决议。决议说，赫鲁晓夫访问美国的崇高使命所取得的成就使我们更加相信，战争是能够避免的，全世界人民能够而且应该像和睦的邻居一样在和平与友谊之中生活。
    在列宁格勒的基洛夫纺纱轴线联合工厂的工人大会上，电气工人苏奇科夫发言说，赫鲁晓夫访问美国有助于缓和国际紧张局势。苏联政府首脑在联合国大会上的发言使很多“冷战”支持者陷入僵局。现在应该让西方国家回答苏联的全面彻底裁军的建议。
    在基辅“红色挖掘机”工厂的工人大会上通过了一项决议。决议说，赫鲁晓夫访问美国再一次使人们坚信，苏联是为争取和平而斗争的先锋队。
    拉脱维亚的化学家卡尔宁院士说，为了保证各国人民的安全和不同社会经济制度国家的长期和平共处，必须实现全面彻底裁军。他说，赫鲁晓夫在联合国就这个问题所提出的建议是一个全面而具体的计划，它的历史意义是难以估计的。
    巴库的石油机器制造厂也举行了全体职工大会，讨论了苏联政府首脑访美的结果。老工程师加日耶夫说，只有全面彻底裁军才是使人类永远摆脱新的世界大战威胁的坚决措施。我们同美国人要在车床旁边、在建筑工地上、在田野上较量，而不是在硝烟弥漫的血战中较量。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：“朝日周刊”最近发表文章说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的建议指出了消除原子战争威胁的道路。
    由“朝日新闻”社论委员会委员渡边诚毅写的这篇文章说，赫鲁晓夫的建议不但展示全世界的理想，并且清楚地指出了实现彻底裁军的途径。
    渡边诚毅在详细说明了这项建议后说，西方没有理由反对逐步裁军的建议。他又说，西方不应对它一笑置之。
    名记者岩立一郎和另外两位作家在“中央公论”月刊上著文欢迎赫鲁晓夫的建议。他们都认为，这个建议是一项包含了全人类的愿望的现实计划。
