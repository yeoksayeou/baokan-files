    Latin American Genius
    ——Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Death of Euclides da Cunha
    Zhou Erfu
    We are in a great era where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is flourishing, and the national liberation movements and people's democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward. The Chinese people have always expressed great sympathy and support for the national and democratic movements in Latin America. Literary works reflecting the national and democratic struggles in Latin America have also aroused great interest among the Chinese people and are respected by the broad masses of the Chinese people. In 1953, we commemorated the centenary of the birth of the great Cuban revolutionary poet José Martí. Today, we solemnly commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the great Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha (1866-1909). Euclides da Cunha, like José Martí, is a world cultural figure. His works are not only, as the Brazilian people say, "the bible of Brazilian nationalism," but also an important treasure in the world's literary treasury.

    I

    Brazil is a great country in Latin America with a tradition of national and democratic revolutionary struggle. In order to establish an independent and democratic republic and destroy Portuguese colonial rule, the Brazilian people launched many uprisings. Although these uprisings failed many times, the revolutionary sentiment of the Brazilian people demanding independence did not diminish, but spread throughout the country. In 1889, inspired by the ideas of Benjamin Constant, a leader of the middle class and intellectuals in the Republican movement of the Liberal Party, and led by the progressive military men Fonseca and Peixoto of the Conservative Party, a nationwide uprising was launched, driving Pedro II, the ruler of Portugal in Brazil, off the throne. However, although Brazil changed from a monarchy to a republic, the large landowners still effectively controlled the government. They owned vast amounts of land and lived like monarchs on their plantations, doing whatever they wanted. The government and the army were merely their tools; even the church was under their control, and priests blessed their exploitative system and cruel acts of oppression against the people.

    After the establishment of the republic, Benjamin Constant of the Liberal Party and Fonseca of the Conservative Party had disagreements. The Conservative Party colluded with the large landowners and the old aristocracy to seize power. In 1891, Fonseca dissolved the parliament, ascended to the throne of a dictator himself, and established a dictatorial regime. The large landowners relied on military dictatorship, betrayed the interests of the motherland by relying on imperialism externally, and cruelly suppressed the people's movement internally, especially the peasant movement. From 1896 to 1897, the government dispatched six thousand troops to suppress the Canudos peasant uprising. This was a famous and inhumane event filled with bloodshed, and it was also an epic heroic feat of the Brazilian people resisting the rulers.

    II

    The great writer Euclides da Cunha lived in this turbulent historical era. He was born on January 20, 1866, in Santa Rita do Rio Negro, former province of Rio de Janeiro. His mother died when he was three years old, and he grew up under the care of his aunt; at the age of eleven, he entered a boarding school. He received secondary education in the capital and decided to become an engineer. In 1884, he was admitted to the Higher Technical School, and in 1886, he was admitted to the Military School. This was related to his father's poor economic situation. The Military School was free, and graduation guaranteed employment.

    After the war between Brazil and Paraguay, many officers were selected from the soldiers in the battles, thus forming the democratic core of the troops. The life away from home and the battles of life and death also created a precious friendship between the soldiers. At that time, the ideas of abolishing slavery, establishing a republic, and striving for democracy and freedom were also spreading in the army.

    As early as in the Ateneu School, Euclides da Cunha was influenced by democratic ideas and determined the direction of his lifelong efforts. The greatest influence on him was his teacher Benjamin Constant. Benjamin Constant was influenced by the French Revolution, advocated "liberty, equality, fraternity" politically, and Comte's positivism was his ideological foundation. He opposed the rule of the Catholic Church in education, opposed feudal morality and feudal order, and advocated scientific research.

    When Euclides arrived at the Military School, he devoted himself to the movement to abolish slavery with even greater enthusiasm and firmly declared himself a republican. In 1888, a heroic act of resistance made him famous throughout the country. In that winter, the famous Brazilian republican Trouillot returned from Europe and was greeted with an extremely grand welcome by the people, so that the students of the Military School were so excited that they could not calm down. The Minister of the Army, Coelho, understood this unfavorable situation. In order to weaken the influence of republican ideas and prevent unexpected actions by the students, he decided to hold a review. As some of the reviewing cadets passed by, suddenly one cadet left the ranks and ran to the Minister of the Army. He wanted to break his saber to protest the military authorities' ban on cadets publicly supporting republican beliefs. But the saber did not break, so he had to throw the saber at the feet of the Minister of the Army. This surprising move shocked the whole audience, and everyone's eyes were fixed on this person, who was Euclides. He was only twenty-two years old at the time. In order to reduce the influence of this heroic act and cover up the truth of the matter, the rulers insisted that he was mentally ill and wanted to send him to the hospital for diagnosis, so that he could continue to study at the Military School. He resolutely refused this shameful arrangement. Therefore, he was expelled and went to São Paulo to find a new job.

    Republican ideas had a greater influence in São Paulo. There, Euclides wrote his first article for the newspaper, followed by two sets of essays published under the pseudonym Proudhon: "Social Problems" and "Speech and Action," which attracted the attention of a wide audience.

    In 1889, the feudal dynasty collapsed. One year after the establishment of the republic, Euclides, who had protested that year, was reabsorbed by the leaders of the Military School and promoted to lieutenant in the same year. He remained in the army until 1896. In the early turbulent years of the republic, defending Rio and resisting the naval rebellion were the most difficult days of his military life. In 1897, he accompanied the army as a journalist on an expedition to Canudos in the interior of Bahia. This expedition became the theme of his masterpiece "Os Sertões" (Rebellion in the Backlands).

    He passed away in August 1909. He was only forty-three years old when he died, at the height of his vitality and talent, and had just settled down to prepare to write his masterpiece when he unfortunately left this world. His life was spent in poverty and turmoil, in persecution and resistance, and in opposition to slavery and pursuit of the ideals of democratic republic.

    III

    Euclides was a writer, journalist, political commentator, geographer, historian, military engineer, and socialist. He studied Marx's works and had great confidence in the future victory of the proletariat. Throughout his life, he wrote many political commentaries, essays, prose, and other literary works. In the article "The Mission of Russia" in the book "À Margem da História" (On the Margins of History), Euclides said that Russia would become "a huge and invincible country, the sentinel of European culture." In some essays in "À Margem da História", he exposed the cruel exploitation of rubber tappers by plantation owners in the Amazon region. In "Peru vs. Bolivia," he expressed his views on the border dispute between Peru and Bolivia. In the lecture "Castro Alves e o Seu Tempo" (Castro Alves and His Time), he analyzed the relationship between the works of this Brazilian romantic poet and the times. He also wrote essays on logic: "Verdade e Ilusão" (Truth and Illusion) and "A Ideia do Ser Integral" (The Idea of Integral Being). His most famous work is "Os Sertões". This work established his position in the literary world and enjoyed national and international reputation. It is one of the most important literary works in Brazil and is included in the world's literary forest.

    "Os Sertões" reflects the tragedy of the Republican government sending six thousand troops to suppress the Canudos peasant uprising from 1896 to 1897.

    Canudos was a small town in the backlands of Bahia, a barren and infertile land with periodic droughts. The herders living in this area lived a very poor and primitive life, often suffering from natural disasters, hunger, and cold, but they still had to pay a certain number of livestock to the ranchers every year. Most of them were mixed-race people, and they developed a hard-working, tenacious, and resilient character in the harsh environment. In the 1880s, a priest named Antônio Conselheiro came to this area, preaching Christian doctrine, opposing papal autocracy, and predicting that a wise emperor would be born in the world. The residents, unable to bear the oppression of the ranchers, listened to his legend and, with Canudos as the center, gathered crowds to launch an uprising and establish a primitive communal government; but there was no strict organization and discipline, and they demanded the restoration of the monarchy. This peasant uprising was mainly because after the establishment of the Republican government, the slave system was not completely destroyed, and the peasants' lives did not improve because of the establishment of the Republican government. On the contrary, due to the exploitation and oppression of the large ranchers and due to periodic droughts, life became more difficult and painful. The government sent troops to suppress it three times, and all failed, which greatly alarmed the ruling class.

    Euclides, as a bourgeois intellectual, had his own process of understanding this uprising. Initially, he thought it was an attempt by the royalists to restore the monarchy, and a crisis occurred in the new republic. At that time, he published an article in the São Paulo newspaper titled "A Nossa Vendée" (Our Vendée), comparing the Brazilian peasants' resistance to the large landowners and the military dictatorial government controlled by the large landowners with the French landowners, wealthy peasants, and nobles who organized peasant armed forces to resist the French Revolution. This revealed his complete lack of understanding of the real situation in Brazil and the truth of the Canudos uprising. But he was a man who pursued the truth. When he understood the truth of a matter, he would revise his incorrect opinions. He longed to understand the truth of the Canudos uprising. It just so happened that the São Paulo newspaper hired him as a journalist to follow the government army to report on war news. He gladly accepted this invitation. When he went there, the government army was already on its fourth expedition. As soon as he entered this area, which was often subjected to periodic droughts and covered with forests, he witnessed the real situation: on one side were more than three thousand hardworking and brave Jagunços, whose weapons were only ox forks and muskets, standing at the door of their homes to resist six thousand government regular troops with artillery in order to protect the lives of their families. This large-scale struggle and massacre left an indelible and extremely deep impression in his mind. The Jagunços were tenacious and brave, and even women and children showed their strong and unyielding character. Three thousand Jagunços resisted the government army until all were sacrificed, leaving only four people - two men, one child, and one old man. They did not succumb to this and continued to persist in the ruined houses destroyed by artillery fire, resolutely resisting the siege of six thousand regular troops to the end. They did not give in until the bullets ran out, they were injured, and they stopped breathing. What a great heroic act! What a noble style! This is the manifestation of the Brazilian people's revolutionary spirit of resisting rulers and oppressors! This is a typical representative of the Brazilian people's tenacious and resilient character! From this bloody massacre, Euclides saw the reality of Brazil and the truth of the Canudos uprising. There were no royalists here, but the cruel exploitation and persecution of the slave system. There were three thousand Jagunços who were suffering from natural disasters and living in poverty and hunger. They raised the banner of resistance for survival. He realized that this was "the madness of the Republican government," "a great sin," and "a major stain in Brazilian history"!

    "Os Sertões" is divided into three parts: The Land, The Man, and The Fight. The first part studies the geology, geography, topography, hydrology, flora, and fauna of this region. The second part compares and studies the local residents. The writer refutes many arguments that inland residents are inferior and worse than others. He describes their dignity as human beings, their traditions, their temperament, and their never-yielding character. The third part describes the Jagunços' struggle against the organized army. Euclides used his emotional style to indignantly expose the inhumane atrocities of the government army, enthusiastically praise the bravery and tenacity of the Canudos peasant uprising, and condemn the unjust war and massacre.

    "Os Sertões" is a difficult book to classify. It has exciting narratives and beautiful and detailed descriptions, it has scientific analysis and research, it has theories, it has the author's imagination, but it is not a fictional story. It is the truth of the Canudos uprising, an accusation of a massacre. In the author's words, it is a "book of revenge". There is no protagonist in the book, and it can be said that there are only two characters: the peasants of the backlands and the government army.

    As soon as this huge masterpiece reflecting the essence of Brazilian social reality was published, it immediately attracted the attention of a wide audience. It caused a sensation throughout the country, had a great impact, and left an extremely deep impression on readers. It still has its important influence today. It is an important classic work of Brazilian literature, a milestone in Brazilian literary history, marking the beginning of a new literary direction. Euclides is one of the founders of Brazilian realism. Brazilian modern literature has inherited and carried forward the tradition of realism. In the works of many famous Brazilian writers today, we can see the influence of Euclides.

    Fifty years have passed since the death of Euclides. As early as the end of the 19th century, when the imperialist forces invaded Brazil in various ways and methods, he put forward to the people the Brazilian class struggle and national struggle, ruthlessly exposed the crimes of the ruling class in cruelly massacring the people, and powerfully demonstrated the invincible great strength of the Brazilian people. The invading forces of imperialism and the reactionary forces of the Brazilian ruling class have fallen, and the people's strength has become even stronger. All reactionary forces, no matter how powerful they may seem for a time, appear very small in the face of the people. On the vast and beautiful land of Brazil, a revolutionary struggle to safeguard national independence and strive for democratic freedom is currently unfolding like a landslide. The indomitable, tenacious, and resilient Brazilian people will surely achieve victory. The sun of a new century will surely rise from the great Brazilian horizon, and it will surely rise from the horizons of the Latin American countries. Let us raise our hands and welcome the sun of the new century in the Western Hemisphere!

    拉丁美洲的天才
    ——纪念欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚逝世五十周年
    周而复
    我们正处在一个东风压倒西风的伟大时代。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正欣欣向荣，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动和人民民主运动日益高涨。中国人民对于拉丁美洲的民族、民主运动一贯表示了极大的同情和支持。反映拉丁美洲民族、民主斗争的文学作品也引起了中国人民浓厚的兴趣，受到广大中国人民的尊重。1953年我们曾经纪念古巴伟大的革命诗人何塞·马蒂诞生一百周年，今天我们又隆重地纪念巴西伟大的作家欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚（1866—1909）逝世五十周年。欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚和何塞·马蒂一样，都是世界文化名人。他的作品不仅像巴西人民所说的是“巴西民族主义的圣经”，而且是世界文学宝库里的重要财富。
    一
    巴西是拉丁美洲的一个伟大的国家，具有民族、民主革命斗争的传统。为了建立独立民主的共和国，摧毁葡萄牙的殖民统治，巴西人民曾经多次地举行起义，尽管这些起义也多次失败过，但是，巴西人民要求独立的革命情绪并不因此减低，而是在全国蔓延开去。1889年终于在自由党本哲明·贡斯当这位共和运动中的中产阶级和知识分子的领袖的思想鼓舞下，在进步军人保守党的丰塞卡和皮蒙托的领导下，发动了全国性的起义，把葡萄牙在巴西的统治者彼德罗二世赶下了帝王的宝座。可是巴西虽然由君主国家变为共和国，大庄园主却仍然实际上掌握着政权。他们拥有数量巨大的土地，在他们的种植场里，他们过着像君主一样的生活，为所欲为。政府和军队不过是他们的工具；连教堂也在他们的控制之下，神父为他们的剥削制度和压迫人民的残忍行为祝福。
    共和国建立以后，自由党的本哲明·贡斯当和保守党的丰塞卡发生了分歧，保守党和大地主、旧贵族勾结，夺取了政权。1891年，丰塞卡解散了议会，自己走上独裁者的宝座，建立了独裁政权。大地主依靠军人专政，对外投靠帝国主义，出卖祖国的利益，对内残忍地镇压人民运动，特别是农民运动。1896年到1897年，政府曾出动了六千军队去镇压卡奴杜斯农民起义。这是历史上有名的充满了血腥气味的惨无人道的大事件，也是巴西人民反抗统治者的史诗般的英雄事迹。
    二
    伟大作家欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚就生活在这动荡的历史时代。他于1866年1月20日诞生在旧里约热内卢省圣塔里塔·马里多·里约·内格罗。他三岁的时候，母亲就去世了，童年是在姨母的扶养之下长大的；十一岁进了寄宿学校。他在首都受了中等教育，决定作工程师。1884年考入高等技术学校，1886年又考进了军事学校。这和他父亲贫困的经济情况有关系。军事学校是免费的，毕业以后保证可以找到职业。
    巴西和巴拉圭战争以后，许多军官是在战役中从士兵里选拔的，因此形成部队的民主核心。离乡背井的生活和出生入死的战斗，也使得战士之间产生了珍贵的友谊。当时废除奴隶制度、建立共和国和争取民主自由的思想，也在军队中传播开来。
    早在阿塞诺学校，欧克里德斯·达·库尼亚就受了民主思想的影响，确定了他一生努力的方向。给他的影响最大的是他的老师本哲明·贡斯当。本哲明·贡斯当受了法国大革命的影响，政治上主张“自由、平等、博爱”，孔德的实证主义是他的思想基础。他反对天主教的统治教育，反对封建道德和封建秩序，提倡科学研究。
    欧克里德斯到了军事学校里，就更加以火样的热情投身于废除奴隶制度的运动中，并且坚定地宣布自己是个共和主义者。1888年一个英勇的反抗事件使他闻名于全国。这年冬季，巴西著名的共和主义者特洛文从欧洲回来，受到人民极其盛大的欢迎，以至影响到军事学校的学生们激动得安静不下来。陆军大臣库埃略了解了这个不妙的情况，为削弱共和主义思想的影响和预防学生的意外行动，决定举行一次检阅。一部分检阅的士官生过去了，忽然有一个士官生离开队伍，跑到陆军大臣面前，他想折断自己的军刀来抗议军事当局禁止士官生公开拥护共和的信念。可是刀没有折断，他只好把军刀扔到陆军大臣的脚下。这一惊人的举动震动了全场，大家的眼光注视着这个人，他就是欧克里德斯。那时他只有二十二岁。统治者为了缩小这次英雄行径的影响，掩盖事实的真象，硬说他是精神病患者，要送他到医院去诊断，这样便可以让他继续在军事学校里学习。他坚决拒绝了这种可耻的安排。因此，他被开除了，到圣保罗去寻找新的职业。
    圣保罗的共和思想影响更大。欧克里德斯在那儿给报纸写出了第一篇文章，接着用蒲鲁东笔名发表两组散文：“社会问题”和“言语及行动”，吸引了广大读者的注意。
    1889年封建王朝崩溃了。共和国成立后一年，当年抗议的欧克里德斯又被军事学校的领导人吸收进去，同年提升为中尉，他一直到1896年都在部队里。在共和国最初动荡的年月中，保卫里约，抵抗海军的叛变，是他军事生活中最艰苦的日子。1897年，他以记者身份随着军队远征巴伊亚腹地卡奴杜斯。这次远征生活，成为他的杰作“腹地”的主题。
    在1909年8月他与世长辞了。他死的时候才四十三岁，正当生命力旺盛，才华横溢，刚刚安定下来准备写他的巨著时，就不幸离开了人间。他的一生是在贫困与动荡中度过的，是在被迫害与反抗中度过的，是在反对奴隶制度和追求民主共和的理想中度过的。
    三
    欧克里德斯是作家，记者，政论作家，地理学家，历史学家，军事工程师和社会主义者。他研究过马克思的著作，对无产阶级未来的胜利抱有极大的信心。他一生写了许多政论、杂文、散文和其他文艺作品。在“相对与相持”一书的“俄罗斯的使命”一文中，欧克里德斯说俄罗斯将成为“巨大的不可征服的国家，是全欧洲文化的哨兵”。在“历史的边缘”的一些杂文中，他揭露亚马逊河流域种植园主对橡胶收集者的残酷剥削。在“秘鲁对抗玻利维亚”一书中，他表明了秘鲁和玻利维亚关于边界问题争论的意见。在“卡斯特罗·阿尔维斯和他的时代”讲稿中，他分析了巴西这位浪漫主义诗人的作品和时代的关系。他还写过关于逻辑学的论文：“真理和谬误”和“存在的理念”。他最著名的作品是“腹地”。这部作品奠定了他在文坛上的地位，享有全国和国际的声誉。这是巴西最重要的文学作品之一，列入世界文学之林。
    “腹地”是反映1896年至1897年共和政府派出六千军队去镇压卡奴杜斯农民起义的悲剧。
    卡奴杜斯是巴伊亚州腹地的一个小城，是一片有周期性干旱的荒芜不毛之地。居住在这个地区的牧民过着十分贫困的原始生活，经常遭受天灾、饥饿和寒冷的袭击，但每年还得向牧场主缴纳一定数额的牲口。他们大半是混血种人，在艰苦的环境里养成了刻苦、顽强和坚韧的性格。在十九世纪八十年代，这地区来了一位教士，名字叫做安东尼奥·贡塞叶洛，宣传基督教义，反对教皇专制，预言一个英明的帝王将要诞生在人间。居民们受不住牧场主的压迫，听信他的传说，以卡奴杜斯为中心，聚众起义，建立了原始公社式的政府机构；但是没有严格的组织和纪律，而且要求恢复君主政治。这次农民起义主要是因为建立共和政府之后，没有彻底摧毁奴隶制度，农民并不因为共和政府成立生活有所改善，相反的，由于大牧场主的剥削和压迫，由于周期性的旱灾，生活更加艰难和痛苦。政府三次出兵去镇压都失败了，统治阶级因此大惊失色。
    作为资产阶级知识分子的欧克里德斯对这一次起义的认识有他的过程。最初，他认为是保王党企图复辟，新生的共和国发生了危机。他当时在圣保罗州报发表了一篇题名“论我们的万代”，把巴西农民反抗大地主和大地主掌握的军人独裁政府，和法国地主、富农和贵族在万代省组织农民武装反抗法国大革命相提并论，这就暴露了他对巴西现实情况和卡奴杜斯起义的真象完全不了解。但他是一个追求真理的人。当他了解了一件事情的真象，他就会修正他的不正确的意见。他渴望了解卡奴杜斯起义的真象。正好圣保罗报聘请他作记者，随着政府军队出发，报道战争新闻。他很高兴接受了这个邀请，他去的时候，政府军已经是第四次远征了。他一进入这个经常遭受周期性旱灾和遍生丛林的地带，就目睹了真实的情况：一边是三千多勤劳勇敢的甲贡索人，他们的武器不过是牛叉和火枪，为了保卫一家老小的生命，站在自己家的门口，抵抗六千名带着大炮的政府正规军。这一场大规模的斗争和屠杀在他脑海里留下了不可泯灭的极其深刻的印象。甲贡索人顽强而又勇敢，连妇女和儿童也表现出了他们坚强不屈的性格。三千甲贡索人抵抗政府军都牺牲了，只留下四个人——两个男子，一个小孩和一个老头。他们并不因此屈服，仍旧坚持在炮火摧毁了的残破房屋里面，对六千正规军的围攻，坚决抵抗到底。一直到子弹打光了，受了伤，停止了呼吸，也不屈服。这是多么伟大的英雄行为！这是多么高尚的风格！这是巴西人民反抗统治者、压迫者的革命精神的表现！这是巴西人民顽强、坚韧性格的典型代表！欧克里德斯从这一次血腥的屠杀里，他看到巴西的现实和卡奴杜斯起义的真象。这儿没有保王党，这儿有的是残酷的奴隶制度的剥削和迫害。这儿有的是三千甲贡索人遭到自然的灾害，过着贫困和饥饿的生活。他们为了生存，举起了反抗的旗帜。他认识到这是“共和政府的疯狂行为”，是“莫大的罪恶”，是“巴西历史上一大污点”！
    “腹地”全书共分三部：土地、人民和斗争。第一部分研究这一地域的地质、地理、地形学、水文学、植物志和动物志。第二部分比较、研究当地的居民。作家驳斥了许许多多认为内地居民低劣，不如旁人的论调。他描述他们作为人类的尊严，他们的传统，他们的气质和他们永不屈服的性格。第三部分描写甲贡索人反对有组织的军队的斗争。欧克里德斯以他充满了感情的笔调，愤慨地揭露政府军队的惨无人道的暴行，热情地歌颂卡奴杜斯农民起义的勇敢和顽强，谴责非正义的战争和屠杀。
    “腹地”是一本很难归类的书，它有激动人心的叙述和优美的细致的描写，它有科学分析和研究，它有理论，它有作者的想像，但不是虚构的故事，是卡奴杜斯起义的真象，是一场大屠杀的控诉，用作者的话来说，是一本“复仇的书”。书中没有主角，可以说人物只有两个：腹地的农民和政府的军队。
    这部篇幅巨大反映巴西社会现实本质的巨著一出版，立刻引起广大读者的注意。轰动了全国，发生很大的影响，在读者中留下了极其深刻的印象。直到今天还有它重要的影响。它是巴西文学的重要经典著作，是巴西文学史上的里程碑，标志着一个新的文学方向的开端。欧克里德斯是巴西现实主义奠基人之一。巴西现代文学继承和发扬了现实主义的传统。在现代许多著名的巴西作家的作品里，我们可以看到欧克里德斯的影响。
    欧克里德斯逝世已经整整五十个年头。早在十九世纪末，当时帝国主义势力以各种不同的方式、方法侵入巴西，他就向人民提出了巴西的阶级斗争和民族斗争，无情地揭露了统治阶级残酷屠杀人民的罪行，有力地表现了巴西人民不可战胜的伟大力量。当年帝国主义的侵略势力和巴西的统治阶级的反动势力倒下去了，人民的力量更加强大了。一切反动势力不管一时如何貌似强大，但在人民面前就显得非常渺小。在巴西辽阔、美丽的土地上，目前正展开排山倒海似的维护民族独立和争取民主自由的革命斗争，不屈不挠、顽强坚韧的巴西人民一定会取得胜利。一个新世纪的太阳必将从伟大的巴西地平线上升起，也必将从拉丁美洲各国的地平线上升起。让我们举起双手，去迎接西半球的新世纪的太阳！
