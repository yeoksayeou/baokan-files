　　Hanoi, October 20th (By our Correspondent) — Enterprise reform in North Vietnam's factories, mines, construction sites, and state-owned farms has achieved remarkable results. As of the end of September, twenty-five units had completed enterprise reform, sixty-four units were about to complete it, and ninety-seven units were in progress. These units have a total of more than 133,000 workers. According to the plan of the Central Enterprise Reform Committee, the enterprise reform work in the entire north can be basically completed by the end of this year, except for some local enterprises.

　　Enterprise reform in North Vietnam began in October of last year. After gaining preliminary experience from a three-month pilot project, it gradually unfolded from January of this year. The purpose of this enterprise reform is to raise the political awareness of the vast number of employees, improve enterprise management, reform technology, and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of national production plans; at the same time, it aims to achieve head responsibility, Party committee leadership, and worker participation in management.

　　The enterprise reform work is carried out in two steps. The first step mainly involves studying the Party Central Committee's instructions on enterprise reform, recognizing the necessity of enterprise reform; factory leading cadres examine the shortcomings and problems in leadership work; socialist education is carried out for employees, and debates are launched on the two systems (socialist system and capitalist system). The second step mainly involves improving unreasonable rules and regulations, mobilizing employees to put forward rationalization proposals; carrying out technological reforms, and improving management systems.

　　In the process of the work, leading cadres of Party, government, trade union, and Youth League organizations in various units personally went deep into the masses of employees to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner.

　　Through socialist education, the political awareness of the vast number of employees has been greatly improved, the spirit of being masters of their own affairs has been promoted, labor competitions have been launched, rationalization proposals have been actively put forward, and technology has been boldly improved. The Nam Dinh Textile Factory used to have each worker only able to tend to 250 spindles, and the factory's labor models could tend to a maximum of 500 spindles; but in the enterprise reform, due to the increased enthusiasm of the workers and the improvement of operating techniques, each person can generally tend to 500 spindles, and the highest can tend to 800 spindles. Last year, the Hanoi Power Plant employees put forward a total of 123 rationalization proposals throughout the year, while this year, after enterprise reform, employees put forward 51 rationalization proposals in June alone.

　　Through enterprise reform, many enterprise departments have completed or overfulfilled their production plans ahead of schedule; production costs have also generally been reduced. The Hanoi Hoang Van Thu Paper Mill overfulfilled the first nine months of this year's production plan by 12.46%, labor efficiency increased by 2% to 17% compared with the original plan, and product costs decreased by an average of 29.27%.

　　In the enterprise reform, various units abolished many unreasonable rules and regulations. Workers directly participated in production management, and production plans were submitted to employee congresses and worker management production groups for discussion, making the production plans the actual actions of the employees.

　　Management cadres' participation in production has played a significant role in improving production management. Various units generally stipulate that management cadres should participate in physical labor for one to two days a week, and some units stipulate one month of labor per year. Due to the participation of cadres in labor, the relationship with the workers has been further strengthened, and many problems related to production and workers' lives have been resolved in a timely manner.

　　Through enterprise reform, the Party's leading role in enterprises has been greatly strengthened, and many new systems have been established. (Attached pictures)

    企业改革促进生产高涨
    越南厂矿农场欣欣向荣
    职工觉悟提高规章制度改进
    工人参加管理干部参加劳动
    本报河内20日电　越南北方的厂矿企业、工地、国营农场的企业改革工作，取得了显著成绩。截至9月底为止，已有二十五个单位完成企业改革工作，六十四个单位即将完成，九十七个单位正在进行。这些单位的工人共有十三万三千多人。根据中央企业改革委员会的计划，今年年底除了一些地方企业外，全北方的企业改革工作可以基本结束。
    越南北方的企业改革工作，是在去年10月间开始的。经过三个月的试点取得初步经验以后，从今年1月份逐步铺开。这次企业改革的目的，是提高广大职工的政治觉悟，改进企业管理，改革技术，保证完成和超额完成国家生产计划；同时做到首长负责、党委领导、工人参加管理。
    企业改革工作分两步进行。第一步主要是学习劳动党中央关于企业改革的指示，认识企业改革的必要性；工厂领导干部检查领导工作中的缺点和问题；对职工进行社会主义教育，开展两种制度（社会主义制度与资本主义制度）的辩论。第二步主要是改进不合理的规章制度，发动职工提合理化建议；进行技术改革，改进管理制度。
    在工作进行中，各单位的党、政、工会、团的领导干部亲自深入职工群众，了解情况和及时解决问题。
    经过社会主义教育，广大职工政治觉悟大大提高，发扬了当家作主的精神，开展劳动竞赛，积极提出合理化建议，大胆改进技术。南定纺织厂去年每个工人只能看二百五十个锭子，厂内的劳动模范最高看五百个锭子；但是在企业改革中，由于工人的劳动热情提高，改进了操作技术，每个人一般都能看五百个锭子，最高的能看八百个锭子。河内发电厂去年全年职工们共提出了一百二十三个合理化建议，而今年经过企业改革后，仅6月份一个月里职工们就提出了五十一个合理化建议。
    经过企业改革，许多企业部门提前或超额完成了生产计划；生产成本也普遍降低。河内黄文树造纸厂超额12.46％完成了今年头九个月的生产计划，劳动效率比原订计划提高2％到17％，产品成本平均降低29.27％。
    在企业改革中，各单位废除了许多不合理的规章制度。工人们直接参加了生产管理，生产计划提交职工大会和工人管理生产小组讨论，使生产计划成为职工们的实际行动。
    管理干部参加生产，对改进生产管理起了极大的作用。各单位一般规定管理干部每星期要参加体力劳动一天到两天，有的单位规定一年劳动一个月。由于干部参加劳动，进一步密切了与工人的关系，及时解决了许多同生产和工人生活有关的问题。
    经过企业改革，党在企业中的领导作用大大加强，许多新的制度已经建立起来。（附图片）
