    We Became Workers
    With the rapid development of Bulgaria's socialist construction, the ranks of the working class are also expanding day by day. This year, thousands of young men and women responded to the call of the Bulgarian Communist Party and left schools and government offices to join the industrial front, becoming new workers. After entering the factory, they received warm care from Party organizations and veteran workers. These young workers love their new jobs, diligently study technology, humbly learn from veteran workers, and enthusiastically strive for the socialist construction of their motherland. Not long ago, several young workers in Sofia spoke freely about their excitement after becoming workers and their attitude towards work. Below is a summary of their conversation and photos.

    Leaving the Office
  Operating a Crane
    I used to work in the transport workers' union. Of course, I often went to garages and factories to meet with workers at that time, but most of the time was spent in the office. This was not in line with my wishes, so I decided to participate in production. After arriving at the factory, the workers and leaders welcomed me like brothers. Soon I became a crane operator. Every time I came back from work, I always looked at the long line of repaired carriages with joy and pride. I felt keenly that there was a part of my labor in these carriages. How happy and proud I am when they run on the tracks of communism tomorrow! Crane operator Vilchev of the Dimitrov Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory
  Now even Mom is satisfied
    My mother is a housewife. When she heard that I was going to be a worker, she didn't talk to me for three days. She couldn't understand why her daughter needed to graduate from middle school if she was going to be a textile worker. To be honest, I was a little scared when I first entered the factory. However, within two weeks, relying on my own efforts and the help of veteran comrades, I had learned the technology, and a month later I started managing two looms. After receiving my first salary, I bought my mother a piece of clothing. She was very happy and no longer angry with me. But the happiest person is myself, because I have a career at the age of eighteen, can participate in the construction of the motherland, and support myself by my own labor.

  Loving Your Profession
    Overcoming All Difficulties
    When we decided to leave our organizations to go to the factory to participate in labor, some people told us that women could not do the work there, and even said that we could only work for a day or two at most before we had to leave. But they were wrong. We love our new profession and believe that we can overcome difficulties. This is the most important thing. As for experience and technology, that can be learned.
    We are very happy to be able to go to the place where the motherland needs us most. The participation of hundreds of thousands of new forces in enterprises across the country is a great joy for the construction of the motherland. Lathe operator Lozanova Gayaurova
  Repaying her Master with Excellent Results
    Without the enthusiastic guidance of our veteran comrades, technicians, and instructors, our group of girls who had just left school would not have mastered the technology so quickly. They revealed the secrets of the large machines to us. At first, we were still afraid of those unfamiliar machines, but now these behemoths are at our disposal. The veteran comrades are still with us, constantly encouraging and helping us. As their students, in addition to expressing our heartfelt thanks to them, we are determined to make outstanding achievements in labor to repay the care of our masters.

    我们当上了工人
    随着保加利亚社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，工人阶级的队伍也日益扩大。今年，成千青年男女响应保加利亚共产党的号召，从学校、机关走上了工业战线，成了新的工人。他们进厂后，受到党组织和老工人的热情关怀。这些年轻工人都热爱自己新的工作，刻苦地钻研技术，虚心地向老工人学习，热情高涨地为祖国的社会主义建设而努力。不久以前，索非亚几位青年工人畅述了当上工人后的兴奋情绪以及对工作的态度。下面就是他们的谈话摘要和照片。（附图片）

    走出办公室
  驾驶起重机
    以前我在运输业工会工作。当然，在那时我也常去车库和工厂同工人们见面，但是大部分时间是在办公室度过的。这很不合我的心愿，我决定去参加生产。到工厂后，工人和领导同志像兄弟一样地迎接我。不久我就当上起重机司机了。每当我下班回来后，总是高兴而骄傲地看着一长列修好的车厢。我亲切地感到，在这些车厢里也有我的一份劳动。当明天它们在共产主义轨道上奔驰时，我是多么高兴和自豪啊！季米特洛夫机车车辆修理厂起重机司机维尔切夫现在连妈妈也满意啦
    我妈妈是一个家庭妇女。当她听说我要去当工人以后，三天没有和我说话。她老想不通，既然女儿要去当纺织女工，那又何必要中学毕业呢？在我刚进厂时，说实话是有些害怕。但是，在两个星期内我依靠自己努力和老同志的帮助，已学会了技术，一个月后开始管理两台织布机。第一次领到工资后，就给妈妈买了一件衣服，她十分高兴，不再生我的气了。但是，最高兴的还是我自己，因为我今年十八岁就有了职业，能参加祖国的建设，靠自己的劳动养活自己。

  热爱自己职业
    克服一切困难
    当我们决定离开自己的机关到工厂去参加劳动时，有些人对我们说，那儿的工作女人干不了，甚至说我们至多只能工作一、二天就得离开。但是，他们错了。我们热爱自己的新职业，相信能克服困难。这是最重要的。至于经验和技术，那是可以学会的。
    我们非常高兴能到祖国最需要的地方去，成千上万的新生力量参加到各地企业中，这对于祖国建设事业是件大喜事。旋工洛扎诺娃格亚乌罗娃用出色成绩报答师傅
    如果没有我们那些老同志、技师和指导员们的热情教导，那么我们这一批刚出校门的姑娘是不会那么快掌握技术的。他们给我们揭开了大机器的秘密。起初我们还对那些陌生的机器感到害怕，而现在这些庞然大物听我们支配了。老同志们至今还和我们在一起，不断鼓励和帮助我们。作为他们的学生，除了向他们表示衷心感谢外，我们决心在劳动中作出出色的成绩，来报答师傅们的关怀。
