Comprehensive report by our newspaper. Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The 33rd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, lasting fifty days, opened on October 26. The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and mass organizations demanded that the most important issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" be discussed at this Diet session. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, fearing that exposing the essence of its revision of the "Security Treaty" would affect its conspiracy to sign a new treaty within this year, attempted to avoid discussing the "Security Treaty" issue.

On October 28, Kishi Nobusuke delivered a policy speech in the Diet. Disregarding the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, he expressed his determination to persist in the policy of submitting to the United States and concluding an aggressive military alliance with it. He touted the need for Japan to form a closer alliance with the "free world" of Western imperialist countries. Kishi Nobusuke evaded the demands of the Japanese public, refusing to disclose to Diet members and the public the process and content of the treaty revision negotiations, as well as the draft of the new treaty.

In his speech, Kishi Nobusuke admitted that the Japanese coal mining industry was currently in a "serious crisis," but instead of proposing concrete measures to aid the large number of unemployed coal miners, he demanded that workers "not be driven by futile confrontational ideologies" but "cooperate" with capitalists who were attempting to shift the consequences of the crisis onto the workers.

Kishi Nobusuke also requested the Diet to approve the illegal so-called war reparations agreement signed with the South Vietnamese Ngô Đình Diệm clique. Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichirō basically repeated Kishi Nobusuke's arguments in his foreign policy speech.

The Japanese Communist Party's Diet members group issued a statement on the 28th, stating that they would launch a struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's reactionary policies. The statement exposed the fact that Kishi Nobusuke and Fujiyama Aiichirō attempted to conceal the fact that the United States was forcing them to accept the new draft of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" when they delivered their speeches in the Diet. The statement criticized the leaders of the Kishi Nobusuke government for not mentioning the issues of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the Japan-Soviet peace treaty in their speeches in the Diet, and for adopting a deceptive attitude towards the people on issues such as granting war reparations to South Vietnam, domestic disaster countermeasures, coal mine "industrial rationalization," and fiscal and monetary policies.

The statement demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government comprehensively reduce military expenditures and use the money to aid the disaster-stricken people and unemployed coal miners in Japan. The statement said that the speeches of Kishi Nobusuke and others aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government is a fierce enemy of the people of Japan, China, and other Asian countries.

In his interpellation at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 28th, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party Asanuma Inejirō strongly condemned Kishi Nobusuke's policy of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and his policy of hostility toward China. He advocated that Japan take the path of peaceful neutrality. Asanuma pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" goes against the current world situation. Due to Khrushchev's visit to the United States, the ice of the East-West Cold War has begun to melt. However, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet wants to form a bilateral military alliance with the United States. Obviously, this is a military alliance hostile to China and the Soviet Union, and it will inevitably transform into an anti-communist military alliance linked to the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

After severely criticizing the reactionary nature of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Asanuma said that for the sake of Japan's complete independence and peace, Kishi Nobusuke should stop the negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty." Asanuma also said: "It is regrettable that the Kishi cabinet is taking a wait-and-see attitude on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations." He demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government stop its policy of hostility toward China, conduct friendly negotiations with China with sincerity and frankness, and quickly restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Asanuma also pointed out that the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations must be resolved politically. He demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations as soon as possible in accordance with the policy agreed upon by Tanzan Ishibashi that the development of political and economic relations must be combined.

In his reply, Kishi Nobusuke once again refused to implement a policy of peaceful neutrality. He clamored that "free countries must unite to confront communist countries." He also said, "I now clearly state that I have no intention of suspending negotiations on revising the Security Treaty." He also concealed his policy of hostility toward China.

The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and others have decided to launch a resolute struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government on the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" during this Diet session. "Sohyo" has decided to establish a "Diet Struggle Committee" to launch a struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" both inside and outside the Diet, and has decided to hold the eighth unified action against the revision of the "Security Treaty" on November 27.

### 岸信介在日本国会临时会议上坚持反动政策  日共和社会党猛烈抨击修改“安全条约”  浅沼稻次郎要求从政治上解决恢复日中邦交问题

    岸信介在日本国会临时会议上坚持反动政策
    日共和社会党猛烈抨击修改“安全条约”
    浅沼稻次郎要求从政治上解决恢复日中邦交问题
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：为期五十天的日本国会第三十三次临时会议，已于10月26日开幕。日本共产党、社会党和群众团体要求在这次国会会议上讨论目前最重要的修改日美“安全条约”问题。但是，岸信介政府因为害怕揭露它修改“安全条约”的本质，影响它实现在今年内签订新条约的阴谋，企图避免讨论“安全条约”问题。
    10月28日岸信介在国会发表政策演说。他不顾广大日本人民的强烈反对，表示坚持屈从美国和同美国缔结侵略性军事同盟的政策。他鼓吹日本需要同西方帝国主义国家的“自由世界”结成更密切联盟。岸信介回避日本公众的要求，不肯向议员和公众们公开修改这一条约谈判的经过、内容以及新条约草案。
    岸信介在演说中承认日本煤矿目前处于“严重的危机当中”，但是他不但没有提出救济大量失业煤矿工人的具体措施，反而要求工人“不要徒然为对立思想所驱使”，而同企图把危机后果转嫁给工人的资本家“合作”。
    岸信介还要求国会批准同南越吴庭艳集团签订的非法的所谓战争赔偿协定。外务相藤山爱一郎在他的外交政策演说中基本上重复了岸信介的论调。
    日本共产党国会议员团于28日发表声明，表示将同岸信介政府的反动政策展开斗争。声明揭穿了岸信介和藤山爱一郎在国会发表演说时企图掩盖美国迫使他们接受新的日美“安全条约”草案的事实。声明指责岸信介政府的首脑在国会发表的演说中只字不提有关日中邦交和日苏和约的问题，并且在关于给予南越以战争赔偿、国内灾害对策、煤矿“产业合理化”和财政金融政策等问题上采取了欺骗人民的态度。
    声明要求岸信介政府全面削减军事开支，把这笔钱用于救济日本的受灾人民和失业煤矿工人。声明说，岸信介等的演说引起日本人民日益强烈的不满。岸信介政府是日本、中国以及亚洲各国人民的凶恶敌人。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在28日的国会众议院全体会议的质询中，强烈地谴责了岸信介修改日美“安全条约”和敌视中国的政策。他主张日本走和平中立的道路。浅沼指出，修改“安全条约”是同目前世界形势背道而驰的。由于赫鲁晓夫访美，东西方冷战冰块已经开始融化。而岸信介内阁却想同美国结成双边性的军事同盟。显然，这是敌视中国和苏联的军事同盟，并且必然会转变成为同李承晚集团、蒋介石集团发生联系的反共军事同盟。
    浅沼在严厉抨击新的日美“安全条约”的反动性后说，为了日本的完全独立和和平，岸信介应该停止进行修改“安全条约”的谈判。浅沼还说：“岸内阁对日中关系问题采取着静观的态度，这是很遗憾的。”他要求岸信介政府停止敌视中国的政策，同中国虚心坦率地进行友好的谈判，迅速恢复日中邦交。浅沼还指出，关于恢复日中邦交问题，必须从政治上加以解决。他要求岸信介政府尽早地根据石桥湛山同意的政治和经济关系的发展必须结合起来的方针来恢复日中邦交。
    岸信介在答复中再次表示拒绝实行和平中立政策。他叫嚷“自由国家必须团结起来同共产主义国家对抗”。他并且说，“我现在明确地表示无意中止修改安全条约的谈判。”他还掩饰他敌视中国的政策。
    日本共产党、社会党和日本工会总评议会等都决定在这次国会会议期间就修改“安全条约”问题同岸信介政府展开坚决的斗争。“总评”已决定成立“国会斗争委员会”，在国会内外一齐展开反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，并且决定在11月27日举行第八次反对修改“安全条约”的统一行动。（附图片）
