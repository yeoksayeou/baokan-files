In Praise of the "Moscow Sea"...
Cheng Guangrui

Who threw a bright mirror towards the universe,
    Reflecting the mysterious afterimage of the moon?
For billions of years, we have never met,
    How can we not be excited today!
Those new "seas," new ringed mountain ranges,
    How shall we express our love for them?
Call them "Moscow Sea," "Soviet Mountains"...
    Name them with the most beautiful names in the human world.
We love the Earth, and also the moon and the stars,
    We want to travel to the universe on rockets,
We want to stand by the "Moscow Sea," on the "Soviet Mountains,"
    And gaze at the more distant Mars, Venus...
We are willing to name the mountains and seas of every planet,
    With "Love," "Hope," "Peace," "Beijing"...
Today, red rockets have already opened the road,
    Tomorrow, the entire universe will be filled with the joyful east wind!

    颂“莫斯科海”……
    程光锐是谁向宇宙抛一面明镜，照见了月亮的神秘的后影？亿万年了，我们从来没有见过面，今天，我们心中怎么能不激动！那些新的“海”，新的寰形山岭，我们怎样向它们表示我们的爱情？叫它们“莫斯科海”、“苏维埃山”……用人间最美丽的名字给它们命名。我们爱地球，也爱月亮和星星，我们要乘着火箭到宇宙去旅行，我们要站在“莫斯科海”边、“苏维埃山”上，眺望那更遥远的火星、金星……我们愿给每个星球的山海命名，用“爱情”、“希望”、“和平”、“北京”……今天，红色火箭已经打开了道路，明天，整个宇宙将充满欢乐的东风！
