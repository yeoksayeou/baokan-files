　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th. New York Dispatch: The American "National Guardian" weekly, published today, reports that the U.S. Army is stepping up preparations for chemical and bacteriological warfare, and is organizing a propaganda campaign to portray chemical and biological warfare as "humane" warfare and these weapons as "ideal" weapons.

　　The weekly pointed out that the U.S. Army Chemical Corps is currently producing chemical and biological weapons. At the same time, military personnel in all public speeches emphasize the development of nerve agents.

　　Arthur G. Trudeau, head of the Army Research and Development Office, said in a special interview with an Associated Press reporter: "I think nerve agents are the weapons of the future. I feel that we don't have very effective and humane weapons."

　　Rothschild, former head of the Chemical Corps Research and Development Office, wrote: "If we use such weapons, we will gain greater benefits. We will be fighting against a far greater number of troops, and for this situation, chemical and biological weapons are ideal weapons." Rothschild, like all others who advocate chemical warfare, calls for more funding for the Chemical Corps.

　　The "National Guardian" weekly pointed out that the Army has spent billions of dollars in the trial production of these extremely frightening chemical and biological weapons. In addition to non-lethal tear gas and vomiting gas, the Army also stores deadly nitrogen mustard gas, phosgene, and nerve agents. The weekly then said that, at the same time, bacteriological weapons have also made great progress. The weekly quoted science writer Walter Schneir, who wrote in the "Reporter" magazine on October 1, as saying, "In the facilities at Fort Detrick, insects carrying infectious germs are often kept. The insects kept include mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever, malaria, and dengue fever; fleas that transmit plague; ticks that transmit tularemia, relapsing fever, and Colorado fever; and flies that transmit cholera, anthrax, and dysentery."

　　The frantic activities of preparing for chemical and bacteriological warfare have been opposed by the American people. According to the "Worker's Weekly" on October 11, the Lake Erie Association of Friends meeting expressed regret at a conference over the U.S. military's propaganda campaign for chemical and bacteriological warfare, because this propaganda campaign persuades people to accept the so-called idea that the U.S. can even take steps to launch gas and bacteriological warfare.

　　A group of pacifists, members of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, have been holding vigils outside Fort Detrick since July 1 to protest the preparation for chemical and bacteriological warfare. The vigils were originally scheduled to last for five days, but because of the support of the people, they are still continuing. The initiators intend to continue the vigil until January 1 next year.

　　美国“国民前卫”周刊揭露
    美国处心积虑发展化学和细菌武器
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：今天出版的美国“国民前卫”周刊报道，美国陆军正在加紧准备化学战和细菌战，并且组织了一次宣传运动，把化学战和生物战说成是“人道的”战争，把这些武器说成是“理想的”武器。
    这家周刊指出，美国陆军化学兵团现在正在生产化学和生物武器。同时，军事人员在所有的公开演说中都强调发展神经药物。
    陆军研究和发展处负责人阿瑟·格·特鲁多在专门接见美联社记者时说：“我认为神经药物是将来的武器，我觉得：我们没有非常有效和人道的武器。”
    化学兵团研究和发展处前负责人罗思柴耳德写道：“如果我们使用这种武器的话，我们就会得更大的好处。我们将对人数远为众多的军队作战，对于这种情况，化学和生物武器是理想的武器”。罗思柴耳德与所有其他主张进行化学战争的人一样，呼吁给化学兵团更多的拨款。
    “国民前卫”周刊指出，在试制这些非常骇人的化学武器和生物武器方面，陆军已经花了几十亿美元。除了不会置人于死地的催泪毒气和呕吐毒气而外，陆军还储存了致命的氮毒气、酼毒气和破坏神经的毒气。周刊接着说，同时，细菌武器也有了很大的发展。这家周刊援引科学问题作家华尔特·施奈尔10月1日在“记者”杂志上著文时所用的话说，“在狄特里克堡的设备中，经常保留着带有传染病菌的昆虫。保留的昆虫包括传染黄热病、疟疾和骨痛热的蚊子；传染鼠疫的跳蚤，传染兔热病、回归热和科罗拉多热的扁虱、传染霍乱、炭疽和痢疾的苍蝇。”
    准备化学战争和细菌战争的疯狂活动遭到美国人民的反对。据10月11日的“工人周报”说，伊利湖公谊会的礼拜会在一次代表大会上对于美国军人宣传化学和细菌战争的运动表示遗憾，因为这种宣传运动劝人民接受所谓美国甚至可以采取步骤发动毒气和细菌战争的意见。
    一批和平主义者、修好团契的成员，为表示抗议准备化学和细菌战争，从7月1日开始在狄特里克堡外面守夜，守夜原定进行五天，可是，因为得到人民的支持，直到目前仍在继续中。发起人打算把守夜继续到明年1月1日。
