　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The working class in capitalist countries is launching successive strikes to defend their vital rights and fight back against the attacks of capitalists.
    United States
    Negotiations between the United Steelworkers of America, representing 500,000 striking steelworkers, and the employers broke down on the evening of the 17th.
    These negotiations resumed on the 16th under pressure from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoking the Taft-Hartley Act. Eisenhower appointed a "board of inquiry" to conduct so-called "mediation," but the negotiations failed to reach an agreement due to the employers' stubborn refusal to meet the union's demands. The committee announced the failure of "mediation" on the evening of the 18th.
    According to reports, during the negotiations, the union proposed the following solution: a wage increase of 19.5 cents per hour for the 500,000 striking workers over two years—this increase would be limited to labor insurance and similar fringe benefits in the first year, with a wage increase in the second year. However, the employers only agreed to increase the striking workers' wages by less than 15 cents per hour. The employers also put forward unacceptable demands regarding strengthening the speed-up system.
    Materials released by the U.S. Department of Labor show that there were a total of 2,825 strikes in the United States in the first eight months of 1959. 1.67 million workers participated in the strikes. In August of this year, there were a total of 700 strikes in the United States, with 750,000 workers participating, including 500,000 metallurgical workers.
    England
    Since the beginning of this year, British workers have continuously used powerful strike actions to fight back against the capitalists' attacks and protect their own vital interests, with a scale far exceeding that of last year. According to figures released by the British Ministry of Labor on September 28, the number of strikers in the first eight months of this year reached 463,700, an increase of 78,600 compared with the same period last year. 4.75 million working days were lost due to strikes, an increase of 53.27% compared with the same period last year.
    France
    Several thousand metallurgical workers in the French shipbuilding and repair industry went on strike and demonstrated on the 15th, demanding guaranteed employment and increased purchasing power.
    In Dunkirk, 3,600 workers responded to a joint call from the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and the General Confederation of Labor-Workers' Force, and held a demonstration in the city.
    In Marseille, the struggle of the shipyard workers has lasted for 75 days, with 2,000 people once again protesting on the 15th.
    In order to express solidarity and fight for their demands, metallurgical workers in many factories went on strike in the afternoon. The 1,300 workers at the Provence shipyard also went on strike in the afternoon.
    In Le Havre, many workers went on strike under the call of the three major trade unions.
    Japan
    46,000 coal miners in Kyushu and Hokkaido, Japan, launched a 24-hour strike on the 13th to oppose the capitalists' dismissal of 4,580 miners.
    Workers at the Mitsui Mining Company in Fukuoka Prefecture began a 24-hour strike from the first shift on the morning of the 13th, and held rallies including miners' families in every coal mine residential area to oppose the company's dismissal of 2,020 workers in order to shift the economic crisis.
    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), which is guiding the strike struggle of coal miners in Kyushu and Hokkaido, said on the 12th that the coal miners' struggle against dismissals is a long-term one.
    Workers at the Mitsui and Kijima coal mines in Hokkaido and Kyushu, Japan, held another 24-hour strike on the 16th, continuing to oppose dismissals and delayed wage payments.
    At the same time, coal miners at the Ube Industries also held a 24-hour general strike to protest against the employers' use of "recommended resignation" methods to dismiss 537 workers. The trade unions of Mitsui and Kijima companies decided to hold strikes every Tuesday and Friday from now on. (Attached picture)

　　资本主义国家工人奋起保卫切身权利
    罢工风起云涌  斗争意志昂扬
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：资本主义国家的工人阶级，为保卫切身权利和反击资本家的进攻，接连展开罢工斗争。美国
    代表美国五十万罢工钢铁工人的联合钢铁工人工会同资方的谈判17日晚上宣告决裂。
    这个谈判是在美国总统艾森豪威尔援引塔夫脱—哈特莱法的压力下在16日恢复的。艾森豪威尔任命了一个“调查委员会”从中进行所谓“调解”，但是由于资方顽固地拒绝工会的要求，谈判没有达成协议。委员会已在18日晚上宣布“调解”失败。
    据报道，在谈判过程中，工会提出了这样的解决办法：以两年为期给五十万罢工工人每小时提高工资一角九分半美元——这种提高在第一年里仅限于劳动保险和类似的外加的收益，第二年再增加工资。但是资方只答应罢工工人每小时的工资只增加不到一角五分美元。资方还提出使罢工工人无法接受的关于加强加快制度的要求。
    美国劳工部发表的材料表明，1959年头八个月中，美国共发生了二千八百二十五次罢工。参加罢工的有一百六十七万工人。今年8月份美国共发生了七百次罢工，参加罢工的工人有七十五万人，其中有五十万冶金工人。英国
    今年以来，英国工人不断以有力的罢工行动，反击资本家的进攻，保护自己的切身利益，其规模远超过去年。据英国劳工部9月28日公布的数字，今年头八个月，罢工人数达四十六万三千七百人，与去年同期相比，增加了七万八千六百人，因罢工而损失了四百七十五万个劳动日，比去年同期增加了53.27％。法国
    法国船只制造和修理业的几千名冶金工人15日举行罢工和示威，要求保证就业和提高购买力。
    在敦刻尔克，三千六百个工人响应法国总工会、天主教工人联合会和工人力量总工会的联合号召，在市内举行示威。
    在马赛，造船厂的工人们的斗争已历时七十五天，其中二千人15日再一次提出抗议。
    为了表示团结并争取自己的权利要求，许多工厂的冶金工人，在下午举行罢工。普罗文斯造船厂的一千三百工人也在下午举行罢工。
    在哈佛尔，在三大工会号召之下，有许多工人举行罢工。日本
    日本九州和北海道的四万六千名煤矿工人13日展开了二十四小时罢工，反对资本家解雇四千五百八十名矿工。
    福冈县的三井矿山公司工人，13日早晨从第一班起开始了二十四小时罢工，并且在每个煤矿住宅区举行了包括工人家属参加的奋起大会，反对公司方面为了转嫁经济危机而解雇二千零二十名工人。
    指导着九州和北海道两地煤矿工人罢工斗争的日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章12日说，煤矿工会反对解雇的斗争是长期的。
    日本北海道和九州的三井和杵岛两个煤矿公司的工人，16日再次举行二十四小时罢工，继续反对解雇和延迟支付工资。
    与此同时，宇部兴产公司的煤矿工人也举行了二十四小时的全面罢工，抗议资方用“劝告退职”手法解雇五百三十七名工人。三井、杵岛两个公司的工会决定，今后每逢星期二、五，都要举行罢工。（附图片）
    9月1日，罢工的纽约钢铁工人打着斗争的标语来到大街上，显示出自己的力量。
