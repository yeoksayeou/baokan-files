Academician C.I. Parhon, Honorary President of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday on October 28th. Academician Parhon is deeply loved and respected by the Romanian people, not only for his important contributions to science, but also because he is a heroic fighter for democracy, socialism, and peace.

In his fifty years of scientific research, Academician Parhon has solved a series of complex problems in neurology, neuropathology, and endocrinology. He can be justly considered one of the founders of modern endocrinology. He has written more than a thousand scientific works.

Academician Parhon is not only a scientist, but also an outstanding doctor and professor. As early as 1912, he served as the head of the Department of Neurology and Neuropathology at the University of Iasi. In 1934, he was transferred to the University of Bucharest as the head of Romania's first Department of Endocrinology, until 1940, when he was dismissed by the fascist government for his active anti-fascist activities. He did not return to teaching until after Romania's liberation in 1944.

During the era of capitalist and landlord rule in Romania, Academician Parhon worked under extremely difficult conditions. He used his actions to teach young students to believe in the power of the people and in the great social role of science.

Only after Romania's liberation were his genius and writings given due recognition. In 1946, the Institute of Endocrinology named after Academician Parhon was established in Bucharest. The Romanian Academy of Sciences elected him as an academician and honorary president. The Soviet Academy of Sciences elected him as a corresponding academician in 1947.

Academician Parhon's decades of scientific research are inseparable from the struggle for democracy, socialism, and peace. In his youth, he became acquainted with Marxist doctrine and became involved in the workers' movement. During the underground period, he used various methods to help political prisoners and often used his office as a meeting place for Communist Party members.

Professor Parhon was subjected to various threats from fascists and even forbidden from engaging in any scientific research work because of his democratic beliefs and loyalty to the working class. But these not only did not subdue him, but also strengthened his will to fight.

From the day the Soviet state was born, Professor Parhon openly regarded himself as a loyal friend of the Soviet people, resolutely opposing and exposing all activities against the Soviet Union. Professor Parhon has always been concerned about and promoted the achievements of the Soviet Union in various fields to the broad masses of the people. He currently serves as the chairman of the Romanian-Soviet Friendship Association. Due to his contributions to consolidating Romanian-Soviet friendship, he was awarded the Order of Lenin on his eighty-fifth birthday.

Professor Parhon is a model of scientific workers who stand with the broad masses of the people in struggle and is an outstanding representative of Romanian intellectuals. (Fang)

    杰出的科学家和社会活动家巴洪院士
    10月28日是罗马尼亚科学院名誉主席巴洪院士的八十五岁诞辰。巴洪院士深受罗马尼亚人民的爱戴和尊敬，这不仅因为他在科学方面作出了重要贡献，而且因为他是争取民主、社会主义与和平的英勇战士。
    巴洪院士在其五十年的科学研究中，解决了神经学、神经病学和内分泌学方面的一系列的复杂问题。可以公正地认为他是现代内分泌学的奠基人之一。他的科学著作达一千多部。
    巴洪院士不仅是科学家，而且也是卓越的医生和教授。早在1912年，他就担任雅西大学神经学和神经病学教研室主任。1934年他被调到布加勒斯特大学担任罗马尼亚第一个内分泌学教研室主任，直到1940年，由于他的积极的反法西斯活动而被法西斯政府下令解职。在1944年罗马尼亚解放后，他才重新回到教学岗位上来。
    在罗马尼亚资本家和地主统治的时代，巴洪院士在极艰苦的条件下进行工作，他用自己的行动教导青年学生相信人民的力量，相信科学的伟大社会作用。
    只是在罗马尼亚解放后，他的天才和著作才受到应有的重视。1946年，在布加勒斯特成立了以巴洪院士命名的内分泌学研究所。罗马尼亚科学院选他为院士和名誉主席。苏联科学院在1947年选他为通讯院士。
    巴洪院士数十年的科学研究是同争取民主、社会主义与和平的斗争分不开的。还在青年时代，他就认识了马克思主义学说，并且同工人运动有了联系。在地下工作时期，他用各种办法帮助了政治犯，并且经常把自己的办公室作为共产党员们的集会地点。
    巴洪教授由于他的民主信念和对工人阶级的忠诚，遭到了法西斯分子的种种威胁，甚至不准他从事任何科学研究工作。但这些不但没有使他屈服，而且更加强了他的斗争意志。
    从苏维埃国家诞生的那一天起，巴洪教授就公开以苏联人民的忠实朋友自居，坚决反对并揭穿反对苏维埃的一切活动。巴洪教授一向关怀并向广大人民宣传苏联各方面的成就。他现在担任着罗苏友好协会主席的职务。由于他在巩固罗苏友谊方面的贡献，在他八十五岁诞辰时荣获列宁勋章。
    巴洪教授是同广大人民站在一起斗争的科学工作者的典范，是罗马尼亚知识分子的杰出的代表。　（方）
