Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade. The full text is as follows:
Comrades:
	On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend the warmest congratulations to the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, and to the working class of our country!
	Comrades, as we gather here, our country is in a new high tide of the vigorous mass movement to oppose Right deviation, encourage vigor, and practice increased production and economy. The people of the whole country are actively responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party, and have greeted the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic with brilliant achievements, and are working hard to achieve a continued leap forward in the national economy this year. Based on the current situation, it can be said with complete confidence that the 1959 national economic plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. In terms of industrial production, this year's steel production will exceed 12 million tons, and coal production will also exceed 335 million tons. In terms of agricultural production, although this year suffered from severe floods, droughts, and pests, it still achieved a larger total output than the extraordinarily great leap forward of 1958; the total output value of agriculture will increase by more than 10% compared with 1958. The freight turnover of railways, highways, and tugboats, and the amount of investment in basic construction will also be overfulfilled, and the situation of fiscal revenue and expenditure and market supply is good. The main targets of my country's Second Five-Year Plan can be completed within this year, three years ahead of schedule.
	This year, my country's national economy has continued to leap forward on the basis of the extraordinarily great leap forward in 1958. This fact itself eloquently illustrates that my country's socialist system has unlimited vitality, and fully proves that the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is completely correct.
	Participating in this conference are representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the industrial, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade fronts. You are the representatives who created the great leap forward of 1958 and 1959 on these fronts. The brilliant achievements you and the people of the whole country have achieved in the past two years vividly demonstrate how great the power of the mass movement of socialist construction is after the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts has been basically completed under the guidance of the Party's general line. Our Party has always believed that people are the most active factor in the productive forces. The people are the creators of history. Whether it is revolution or construction, only by mobilizing the people most widely and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people can we achieve victory most quickly and thoroughly. The reason why my country has been able to develop its national economy at a speed unmatched by all capitalist countries in the past ten years, especially in the past two years, and has achieved unprecedented achievements in my country's history, is, in the final analysis, the great victory of the mass movement led by the Party and the great victory of the Party's mass line. The fundamental reason why there are so many advanced collectives and advanced producers participating in this conference and so many heroic figures appearing in our country today lies in this.
	Imperialism always hopes that our great socialist construction cause will "fail," and Right-leaning opportunists exaggerate some individual shortcomings in our work to attack the Party's general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes. However, actual life so powerfully shows how wise the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is, how diligent and brave our workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are, and how foolish our enemies are, and how absurd the arguments of Right-leaning opportunism are!
	Comrades, the achievements we have already made are great. After ten years of construction, especially the great leap forward of last year and this year, my country's economic level has been greatly improved. However, we have no reason to be complacent because of this. The long-term goal of the people of our is to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in a not-too-long period. In order to achieve this goal, we must first catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products in about ten years. This is a arduous and extremely glorious task for the people of our country, especially the working class of our country. At the same time, we must realize the technological transformation of our agriculture as soon as possible, that is, to realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture. In a country like ours with a large population and abundant resources, agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. We must combine giving priority to the development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture, and implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. Realizing the technological transformation of agriculture as soon as possible is of paramount importance for accelerating the speed of socialist construction. This requires industry to arm agriculture with strong modern technology. This is also a glorious task for the people of our country, especially the working class. We have already achieved brilliant achievements in the past ten years, and we will certainly be able to achieve even more glorious achievements in the next few decades. We have all the conditions necessary to realize this great task, and we must redouble our efforts to realize this great task.
	It is only more than two months before the end of the year. The urgent task for the workers and comrades on the industrial, transportation, and basic construction fronts is to strive to complete the national plan for this year ahead of schedule and to prepare conditions for a continued leap forward next year. The workers and comrades on the commercial front should strive to overfulfill the task of purchasing and do a good job in market supply. The workers and comrades on the financial front should do a good job in planning and managing the funds for national construction. With the experience of the leap forward of last year and this year, with the consolidated and soundly developed people's communes, and with the material and technical foundation we have now, it is necessary and completely possible to strive to achieve a better and comprehensive leap forward next year. To this end, we must further implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing Right deviation, encouraging vigor, and practicing increased production and economy, and ensure the implementation of the Party's general line of socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies; we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit in all our work, combine soaring energy with technical reform, and work hard, diligently, and skillfully, not only to produce more and faster, but also better and more economically, paying attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and ensuring safe production; we must continue to give prominence to politics, carry out mass movements on a large scale, implement the method of cadres participating in labor, workers participating in production management, reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, and the combination of enterprise leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, and implement the system of the factory director assuming responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party committee in enterprise management.
	Comrades, you are representatives of advanced units and advanced producers on the industrial, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade fronts, and are the most valuable assets of our Party and country. Your achievements are the glory of the people. In our country, the great historical role of advanced units and advanced producers lies not only in their outstanding achievements in promoting our country's socialist construction cause, but also in their ability to help others and other units quickly improve to an advanced level. We hope that the representatives of advanced units and advanced producers present here will not be arrogant or rash, but will humbly learn and strive to maintain the title of advanced for their units and themselves, and will also promote the communist style and help other units and others catch up to an advanced level. The Party Central Committee believes that you will certainly be able to complete this glorious task.
	Comrades, the people of our country have just spent the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic in boundless joy. We look back on the glorious past with great excitement, and we also look forward to a brilliant future with full confidence. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly believes that your conference will certainly be able to complete its task, summarize and widely disseminate the valuable experience of the various advanced units and advanced producers, and unite the workers of the whole country to further promote the production increase and economy movement that is booming throughout the country, strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule, and create favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the national economy next year.
	I wish you comrades greater achievements in your future work!
	I wish the conference a complete success!

    朱德同志代表中共中央向群英会致祝词
    团结全国职工推进增产节约运动
    提前超额完成今年计划创造明年继续跃进条件
    新华社26日讯　中共中央副主席朱德代表中共中央在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上致祝词。全文如下：同志们：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会，向全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会，向我国的工人阶级，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    同志们，当我们在这里集会的时候，我们的国家正处在反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的轰轰烈烈的群众运动的新高潮中。全国人民积极响应我们党的八届八中全会的号召，已经用辉煌的成就迎接了我们伟大的人民共和国的建国十周年，并且正在为实现今年国民经济的继续跃进而努力。根据现在的情况，可以完全有把握地说，1959年国民经济计划将提前完成和超额完成。在工业生产方面，今年的钢产量将超过一千二百万吨，煤产量也将超过三亿三千五百万吨，农业生产方面，虽然今年遭到严重的水灾、旱灾和虫害，但仍然获得比特大跃进的1958年更大的总产量；农业总产值将比1958年增长10％以上。铁路、公路和轮驳船的货运周转量和基本建设的投资额也将超额完成，财政收支和市场供应的情况良好。我国第二个五年计划主要指标是可以提前三年在今年内完成的。
    今年我国国民经济是在1958年特大跃进的基础上继续跃进的。这个事实本身雄辩地说明我国的社会主义制度具有无限生命力，充分地证明党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。
    参加这次大会的有来自工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易等战线上的先进集体的代表和先进生产者。你们是这些战线上创造1958年和1959年的大跃进的代表人。你们和全国人民在过去两年中所获得的辉煌成就生动地表明，在基本上完成了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命之后，在党的总路线的指导之下，社会主义建设的群众运动具有多么伟大的威力。我们党一贯认为，人是生产力的最积极的因素。人民群众是历史的创造者。无论是革命或者建设，唯有最广泛地动员人民群众，最充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，才能最迅速、最彻底地取得胜利。我国在过去十年中特别是最近两年中之所以能够以所有资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度发展国民经济，获得了我国历史上空前未有的成就，归根到底，是党所领导的群众运动的伟大胜利，是党的群众路线的伟大胜利。参加这次大会的有这样多的先进集体和先进生产者，我国今天出现这样多的英雄人物，其根本原因也正在这里。
    帝国主义总是希望我们伟大的社会主义建设事业“失败”，右倾机会主义分子夸大我们工作中的一些个别缺点，来攻击党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。但是，实际生活如此有力地表明，党中央和毛泽东同志的领导是多么英明，我们的工人、农民和革命知识分子是多么勤劳勇敢，而我们的敌人又是多么愚蠢，右倾机会主义的论调又是多么荒谬！
    同志们，我们已经获得的成就是伟大的。经过十年的建设，特别是去年和今年的大跃进，我国的经济水平已经大大提高了。但是，我们没有任何理由因此而自满。我国人民的远大目标是在一个不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。为了达到这个目标，我们首先要在十年左右时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。这是我国人民特别是我国工人阶级的艰巨的同时也是极其光荣的任务。与此同时，我们要尽快地实现我国的农业技术改造，就是说使农业实现机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。在我们中国这样一个人口众多、地大物博的国度里，农业是国民经济发展的基础。我们必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。尽快地实现农业技术改造，对于加快社会主义建设的速度有着头等重要的意义。这就要求工业以强大的现代技术武装农业。这也是我国人民特别是工人阶级的光荣的任务。我们在过去十年中已经取得了辉煌的成就，我们在未来几十年中也一定能够取得更加光辉的成就。我们有着实现这个伟大任务所需的一切条件，我们一定要为实现这个伟大的任务加倍努力。
    现在距离年底只有两个多月了。工业、交通运输、基本建设战线上的职工同志们当前迫切的任务是争取提前完成今年的国家计划，并且为明年的继续跃进准备条件。商业战线上的职工同志们要努力超额完成收购任务，并且做好市场供应工作。财政战线上的职工同志们要做好国家建设资金的筹划和管理的工作。有了去年和今年的跃进经验，有了巩固的健全发展的人民公社，有了现在这样的物质技术基础，明年必须而且完全可能争取实现更好的全面的跃进。为此，我们必须进一步贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的关于反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的决议，保证党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针的贯彻执行；必须在一切工作中把革命热情和科学精神结合起来，把冲天干劲和技术改革结合起来，做到实干、苦干加巧干，既要又多又快，又要又好又省，注意提高质量，降低成本，并且保证安全生产；必须继续实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，实行干部参加劳动，工人参加生产管理，改革不合理的规章制度，企业领导干部、工人和工程技术人员三方面互相结合的办法，贯彻执行在企业管理上党委集体领导下的厂长负责制。
    同志们，你们是工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易战线上的先进单位的代表和先进生产者，是我们党和国家的最宝贵的财产，你们的成就是人民的光荣，在我们的国家里，先进单位和先进生产者的伟大历史作用，不仅在于他们以自己的卓越成就促进了我国的社会主义建设事业，而且在于他们能够帮助别人和别的单位迅速提高到先进的水平上来。我们希望在座的先进单位的代表和先进生产者同志们不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进的称号，而且要发扬共产主义的风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平。党中央相信你们一定能够完成这个光荣的任务。
    同志们，我国人民刚刚在无限的欢乐中度过了我们的人民共和国成立的十周年纪念日。我们以极大的兴奋回顾光辉的过去，也满怀信心地瞻望着灿烂的未来。中国共产党中央委员会深信，你们的大会一定能够完成自己的任务，把各个先进单位和先进生产者的宝贵经验加以总结和广泛传播，并且团结全国职工，进一步推动正在全国蓬勃开展的增产节约运动，争取提前完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，为明年国民经济的继续跃进创造有利的条件。
    祝同志们在今后工作中获得更大的成就！
    祝大会圆满成功！
