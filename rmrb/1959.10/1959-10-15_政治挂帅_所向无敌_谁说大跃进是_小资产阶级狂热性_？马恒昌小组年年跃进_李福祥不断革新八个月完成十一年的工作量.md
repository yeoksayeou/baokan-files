　　Politics Takes Command, Invincible
    Who Says the Great Leap Forward is "Petty-Bourgeois Fanaticism"?
    Ma Hengchang Group Leaps Forward Every Year
    Li Fuxiang Constantly Innovates, Completing Eleven Years' Work in Eight Months
    (Our Dispatch) The nationally renowned Ma Hengchang Group of Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant is spurring its horse forward and advancing courageously. From January to September this year, they have already completed the workload of one year and seven and a half months. Now, the entire group is full of confidence and fighting hard in the fourth quarter, striving to complete more than a year's workload in the last three months of this year.

    Since its establishment in 1949, the Ma Hengchang Group has consistently overfulfilled the state plan year after year and month after month. During the First Five-Year Plan, the group completed the workload of fourteen years and one month. Last year, they completed the workload of two years and two and a half months, with quality exceeding national standards. The reason why this group has been able to complete seventeen years and nine months of work in the seven years from the First Five-Year Plan to the Second Five-Year Plan, running ahead of time at a rapid pace, is primarily because they have consistently adhered to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements. The Party branch, trade union, and Communist Youth League branch of the Ma Hengchang Group all place ideological work in the primary position, frequently study ideological problems within the group, and conduct meticulous educational work, thus ensuring the continuous improvement of the socialist and communist consciousness of all workers in the group. They persist in carrying out large-scale competitions between individuals, between shifts, between machine tools, and between groups. All workers in the group have upward-thinking minds, and production is reaped every month. Learning and promoting advanced experiences, and continuously innovating technology, are the basic methods for their group to consistently overfulfill the production plan. Since 1950, the group has successively learned and promoted 54 kinds of advanced experiences and created 19 kinds of important production methods. Over the past decade, the workers of the group have put forward more than 400 innovation proposals, including more than 150 major projects.

    Currently, they have expressed that they will consolidate and persist in carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, not only to complete five months of workload in the three months of the fourth quarter, but also to actively prepare for production in the first quarter of next year, to ensure that production will continue to leap forward greatly next year.

    (Our Dispatch) Li Fuxiang, a worker in the metalworking workshop of Shanghai Boiler Factory, a National People's Congress representative, and an advanced producer, constantly innovates technology, stubbornly overcomes various difficulties, and leaves time far behind. This year, he completed eleven years' work in eight months, and is now advancing courageously, striving to complete sixteen years' work for the whole year.

    Li Fuxiang's characteristic is his great dedication and full enthusiasm. The workers in the workshop like to call him a technical "drill expert." His dedication is indeed not small. In recent years, he has engaged in more than 30 innovation projects, increasing production efficiency by one to one hundred times respectively, enabling drilling workers to develop from 30% manual operation to complete mechanization. Recently, he put forward 42 technical innovation proposals, of which 18 have been realized, which can save more than 23,500 man-hours, equivalent to more than nine years of work.

    Li Fuxiang not only strives to learn and create himself, but also is willing to enthusiastically impart technology and help others improve their technical level as soon as possible. In the past five years, he has successively promoted advanced drilling experiences in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin and other places, helping more than 40 factories solve key production problems.

　　政治挂帅  所向无敌
    谁说大跃进是“小资产阶级狂热性”？
    马恒昌小组年年跃进
    李福祥不断革新八个月完成十一年的工作量
    本报讯　全国闻名的齐齐哈尔第二机床厂马恒昌小组催马加鞭、奋勇前进，今年1至9月已经完成一年零七个半月的工作量。现在，他们全组正信心百倍地大战第四季度，要用今年最后三个月的时间，力争再完成一年多的工作量。
    马恒昌小组自1949年成立到现在，一直是逐年逐月超额完成国家计划。第一个五年计划期间，全组完成了十四年零一个月的工作量，去年完成了两年又半个月的工作量，质量超过国家标准。这个小组十年来所以能够在第一个五年计划到第二个五年计划的七年中完成十七年零九个月的工作量，飞奔猛进地走在时间前头，首先就在于他们一直坚持了政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。马恒昌小组的党小组、工会和共青团小组，都把思想工作放在首要地位，经常研究全组内的思想问题，进行细致的教育工作，因而，保证了全组工人的社会主义和共产主义觉悟不断提高。他们坚持开展个人与个人、班与班、机床与机床、组与组的大比大赛，全组工人人人思想向上，生产月月丰收。学习和推广先进经验，不断革新技术，是他们小组一贯超额完成生产计划的基本方法。自1950年到现在，全组先后学习和推广了五十四种先进经验和创造了十九种重要生产方法。全组工人十年来共提出四百多项革新建议，其中重大项目有一百五十多项。
    目前，他们表示要把增产节约运动巩固持久开展下去，不仅要在第四季度的三个月时间内完成五个月工作量，而且要积极做好明年第一季度生产准备，确保明年生产继续大跃进。　（曲伯云）
    本报讯　上海锅炉厂金工车间工人、全国人民代表、先进生产者李福祥不断革新技术，顽强地征服各种困难，把时间老远地抛在后面。今年他以八个月的时间完成了十一年工作量，现正奋勇前进，力争全年完成十六年工作量。
    李福祥的特点是钻劲大，干劲足，车间里的工人们都喜欢把他叫做技术“钻家”。他的钻劲的确不小，几年来他搞三十多项革新项目，生产效率分别提高一倍到一百倍，使钻工从30％的手工操作发展到全部机械化。最近他提出的四十二项技术革新建议，已有十八项实现，可节约两万三千五百多个工时，相当于九年多的工作量。
    李福祥不仅自己努力学习创造，也肯热情地传授技术，帮助别人尽快地提高技术水平。五年来，他先后在上海、杭州、天津等地推广钻工先进经验，帮助四十多个工厂解决生产关键。（附图片）
