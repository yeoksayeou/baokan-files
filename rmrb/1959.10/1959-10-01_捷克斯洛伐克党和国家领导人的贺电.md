To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
Comrade Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China,
Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,
Dear Comrades:

    On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China—its tenth anniversary, we, on behalf of all the working people of the Czechoslovak Republic and in our own names, extend warm comradely greetings and most sincere congratulations to the fraternal, great Chinese people and to yourselves. The decisive victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949 and the founding of the People's Republic of China opened a new historical period for the mighty China, which had suffered long exploitation and deep oppression. The heroic Chinese people, led by the glorious Communist Party of China, overthrew the oppressors at home and abroad and, for the first time in the history of great China, became masters of their own country and builders of their own happiness. The long revolutionary movement, strongly influenced by the world-historically significant victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, triumphed. Due to the victory of the Chinese Revolution, the balance of power between the camp of peace and socialism and the dark forces of war has drastically changed. The invincible socialist camp, closely linked together by the bonds of proletarian internationalism and headed by the Soviet Union, has gained the warm sympathy of all peace-loving forces in the world because of its unwavering adherence to Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The achievements of the socialist camp in all fields have a decisive influence on the development of the world. The ten years of the victorious development of the People's Republic of China have once again shown the world the great strength and power of socialist ideas. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, its long-tested leader and organizer, the Chinese working people have made tremendous achievements in accomplishing the task of socialist construction of their motherland. During the victorious Great Leap Forward movement, Chinese industry has advanced at a tremendous pace, people's communes have been established and have grown, and great achievements have been made in science and technology. Thanks to the selfless and enthusiastic labor of the people of the whole country, the People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly prosperous and powerful, and it is now an important link in the united socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and an important factor in the struggle against the forces of imperialist aggression and for lasting world peace. The working people of Czechoslovakia have always firmly supported the Chinese people's struggle against all foreign imperialism and their own traitors, and have celebrated the founding of the People's Republic of China with great joy. Today, they are sincerely delighted with the significant and creative achievements made by the Chinese people on the road to socialism and communism. They feel deeply happy because of the development of friendship and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries. The Czechoslovak working people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle against the illegal occupation of Taiwan—territory which everyone knows belongs to China—by U.S. imperialism, and firmly advocate that the People's Republic of China must not be prevented from enjoying legitimate representation in the United Nations.

    We wholeheartedly wish the great people of the People's Republic of China and yourselves,
    Dear Comrades,
    further and greater achievements in building a happy future for our beautiful motherland,
    in striving for a happy tomorrow for the great Chinese people,
    and in the struggle for the victory of the forces of peace throughout the world.
    President of the Czechoslovak Republic, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Antonín Novotný
    Premier of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, Viliam Široký
    Chairman of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, Zdeněk Fierlinger
                                        September 29, 1959

    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们：
    值此中华人民共和国的国家节日——它的建国十周年之际，我们谨代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国全体劳动人民并以我们个人的名义，向兄弟般的伟大的中国全体人民和你们本人致以热烈的同志的敬意和最衷心的祝贺。中国革命在1949年取得了决定性的胜利并成立了中华人民共和国，为遭受长期剥削和深重压迫的强大的中国历史开辟了一个新的历史时期。光荣的中国共产党所领导的英勇的中国人民，推翻了国内外的压迫者，并在伟大中国的历史上第一次成为自己国家的主人和自己幸福的建设者。受到伟大十月社会主义革命的具有世界历史意义的胜利的强烈影响的长期的革命运动胜利了。由于中国革命的胜利，和平与社会主义阵营同黑暗的战争势力之间的力量对比发生了急剧的变化。由被无产阶级国际主义的纽带紧密地连结在一起的、以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营，由于坚定不渝地实行列宁关于不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则而得到了世界一切爱好和平力量的热烈同情。社会主义阵营在各方面的成就对世界的发展起着决定性的影响。中华人民共和国胜利发展的十年，再次向全世界显示了社会主义思想的伟大力量和威力。中国劳动人民在自己久经考验的领袖和组织者——中国共产党的英明领导下，在完成祖国社会主义建设的任务中取得了巨大的成就。在胜利地开展大跃进运动期间，中国工业以巨大的步伐向前迈进，人民公社成立并成长了起来，科学技术方面也取得了巨大成就。由于全国人民忘我的和热情的劳动，中华人民共和国日益繁荣强大，它现在是以苏联为首的团结一致的社会主义阵营的重要一环，是反对帝国主义侵略势力，争取世界持久和平的斗争中的重要因素。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民一直坚决支持中国人民同一切外国帝国主义和本国的卖国贼所进行的斗争，并曾以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝了中华人民共和国的成立。今天，他们又为中国人民在向社会主义和共产主义前进道路上所取得的重大的、创造性的成就感到衷心喜悦。他们由于我们两国之间友谊和全面合作的发展而深感幸福。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民完全支持中国人民反对美帝国主义非法侵占大家都知道是属于中国的领土——台湾而进行的正义斗争，并坚决主张不得阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国享有合法的代表权。
    衷心地祝伟大的中华人民共和国全国人民和你们本人，
    亲爱的同志们，
    在建设美好祖国的幸福未来，
    争取伟大中国人民的幸福的明天，
