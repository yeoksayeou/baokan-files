　　No More Wind Disasters, Sand No Longer Moves Southward
    Sanlei Commune Shifts from Internal Defense to External Offense in Sand Control
    (Our Report) The Sanlei People's Commune in Minqin County, Gansu Province, has fully transitioned from the stage of internal defense to the new stage of external offense in its struggle against sandstorms. This significant progress is due to the commune's full exploitation of its enormous power.
    Minqin County is located on the 3,000-li wind and sand line in the northern Hexi Corridor. It stands like an isolated island in the vast ocean of the Tengger Desert, and Sanlei Commune is located at the forefront of the western wind and sand line, making it the most severely affected area by sandstorms. Of the commune's more than 100,000 mu of cultivated land, over 90,000 mu are affected by sandstorms.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the county's farmers transitioned from an individual economy to a path of mutual aid and cooperation, constantly shaking off the shackles of the fatalistic view that "sand is a yellow dragon; the more you control it, the poorer you become." They launched mass movements of planting trees, creating forests, preventing sand, and cultivating grass, actively defending against sandstorms, which has basically controlled the disaster of yellow sand moving southward in this area. However, agricultural cooperatives were ultimately limited in their power and unable to completely eradicate sandstorms. In 1958, after the establishment of people's communes, the Party committee, in accordance with the spirit of "grasping production with one hand and sand control with the other," made overall arrangements for labor, pushing sand control and production to a new stage of rapid development. Last winter and this spring, the commune planted more than 700 mu of trees and forests, equivalent to half the total area of trees and forests planted in the four years of mutual aid and cooperation; sealed off 380,000 mu of sand to cultivate seedlings, equivalent to 157% of the total area of sand sealed off for seedling cultivation in the four years of mutual aid and cooperation; and tended to more than 45,000 mu of young forests, equivalent to 68% of the total area of young forests tended to in the four years of mutual aid and cooperation. The front-line sand pits have been basically greened, and lines of forest networks are interwoven into a beautiful picture of "no more wind disasters, sand no longer moving southward, the Gobi turning into an oasis, and the desert turning into fertile farmland." This year, the per-mu yield of summer-harvested wheat and other grain crops increased by 37 jin compared to the bumper harvest of 1958, an increase of 18%; cotton is growing with abundant fruits, and the cotton fields are like a sea of ​​silver flowers; the commune-run forest farm has launched a comprehensive operation of forestry and sideline industries, with a total income of 1.05 million yuan, equivalent to 84% of the total income in the four years of mutual aid and cooperation. In implementing the policy of combining public and private raising, the number of large and small livestock has also increased rapidly. With the development of production, the income of commune members has increased by an average of 30% compared to last year.
    Sanlei Commune is one of the earliest communes established in Minqin County. The characteristics of this commune in overcoming sandstorms and developing production are:
    ① The organization is large-scale, the scope of activities is wide, and the commune plans its production in a unified manner. In September of last year, the commune organized a 6,300-strong expeditionary army that went deep into the sand dunes 40 li away, fighting sand ridges at night and sand beaches during the day. After two rounds of shock work in winter and spring, the commune created the equivalent of the total amount of trees and forests planted in the past few years. While controlling sand, various productions were also carried out very well. Last autumn, 80% of the commune's land was deep-plowed, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated increased by 40% compared to previous years. The seeding amount was increased from more than 20 jin in the past to 40 jin, and all sowing was done by machine with horses. These reforms in the farming system are indeed groundbreaking events for the Sanlei Commune, which is located on the wind and sand line. The commune's high degree of organization has been fully utilized in basic farmland construction, timely sowing, management, processing, and harvesting. For example, spring sowing was shortened from 20 days last year to 15 days this year, and the summer harvest progress was also shortened by one-third compared to last year.
    ② Under the unified leadership of the commune, with the production team as the foundation, fixed labor, and divided plots, 23 commune-run forest farms were established, and 320 technical workers with forestry expertise were assigned to specialize in sand prevention and afforestation. While building protective forest belts for farmland, the professional forest farms built more than 3,000 mu of economic forests such as fruit trees, apricots, peaches, and dates around the sand dunes, pressed more than 10,000 grape branches, and intercropped 490 mu of grain crops, melons, vegetables, and oil crops in the forest belts. This year, it is expected to generate more than 50,000 yuan in income. The forest farms occupying the front-line positions have now moved into the hinterland of the desert, building new villages in the sand area. The Shajingzi Forest Farm, led by the famous forestry model worker Xue Wanxiang, has penetrated 20 li into the sand dunes.
    ③ Because the people's commune has abundant funds, it can use airplanes and tractors and other machinery for afforestation. Last autumn, airplanes sowed more than 50,000 mu of Artemisia wendelianii and Cleistogenes squarrosa seeds in the sand dunes more than 20 li away, with 500 to 800 seedlings sprouting per square meter. Recently, more than 20,000 mu have been sown again.
    The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC have added boundless confidence and strength to all cadres and members of the Sanlei Commune to launch a large-scale advance into the wind and sand, and to carry out the movement to increase grain and cotton production. They unanimously expressed their commitment, under the guidance of the sand control experimental station established here by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to make full use of the power of the commune, to expand new villages in the sand area, increase the population living in the sand dunes, develop fruit trees and timber forests, and open up new agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery economic bases.

### 风不成灾　沙不南移  三雷公社治沙由内线防御转入外线进攻

　　风不成灾　沙不南移
    三雷公社治沙由内线防御转入外线进攻
    本报讯　甘肃民勤县三雷人民公社，与沙害的斗争已由内线防御阶段全面转入外线进攻的新阶段。这一重大进展是由于公社充分发挥了巨大威力。
    民勤县在河西走廊北部三千里风沙线上，它仿佛像一座孤岛突立在腾格里沙涟的汪洋大海之中，而三雷公社又处在风沙西线的前沿，是遭受风沙灾害最严重的地区。全社十万多亩耕地，就有九万多亩遭受风沙的袭击。
    解放后，在党的领导下，全县农民从个体经济基础上走上互助合作的道路，不断地摆脱“沙是黄龙，越治越穷”的宿命观点的束缚，开展了植树造林，防沙育草的群众运动，积极起来防御风沙，使这一地区黄沙南移的灾害基本被控制了。可是农业社毕竟力量小，无力全面根治风沙。1958年，人民公社化后，党委按照“一手抓生产、一手抓治沙”的精神，统筹安排劳力，把治沙和生产推向飞跃发展的新阶段。去冬今春共植树造林七百多亩，相当于互助合作四年中植树造林总面积的一半；封沙育苗三十八万亩，相当于互助合作四年中封沙育苗总面积的157％；幼林抚育四万五千多亩，相当于互助合作四年中幼林抚育总面积的68％。基本上绿化了前沿沙窝，一条条的林网，交织成一幅“风不成灾，沙不南移，戈壁变绿洲，沙漠变良田”的美丽图景。今年，夏收小麦等粮食作物比大丰收的1958年每亩产量增加三十七斤，增长了18％；棉花亩亩长得硕果累累，银花似海；社办林场展开林、副业综合经营，总收入达一百零五万元，相当于互助合作四年中总收入的84％。在贯彻公养和私养并举的方针中，大、小家畜增加也很快。随着生产的发展，社员收入比去年平均增长了30％。
    三雷公社是民勤县最早建立起来的一个公社。这个社在战胜沙害，发展生产方面的特点是：
    ①组织规模大、活动范围广，统一筹划全社的生产。去年9月间，公社组织了六千三百多人的远征大军，深入到四十华里的沙涟内，夜战沙梁，日战沙滩，经过冬、春两次突击，就创造了等于过去几年植树造林的总和。治沙的同时，各项生产也搞得很出色。去年秋天全社80％的土地进行了深翻，积肥量比往年增加了40％，下种量由过去的二十多斤，提高到四十斤，并全部用马拉机播种。这些耕作制度上的改革，在处于风沙线上的三雷公社来说，确实是件破天荒的大事。在农田基本建设、适时播种、管理加工和收割等方面都充分发挥了公社的高度组织作用。如春播由去年的二十天缩短到今年的十五天，夏收进度也比去年缩短了三分之一。
    ②在公社的统一领导下，以生产队为基础，固定劳力，划分地段，建立了二十三个社营林场，调配三百二十名有林业专长的技术工人，专门进行防沙造林。专业林场在营造护田林带的同时，在沙丘周围营造了三千多亩果、杏、桃、枣等经济林，压葡萄一万多枝，林带间种粮食作物、瓜菜、油料四百九十亩，今年预计可收入五万多元。占据前哨阵地的林场，现在已有七个迁进沙漠复地，建起了沙区新庄。著名的林业劳模薛万祥领导的沙井子林场，已深入沙涟二十华里。
    ③由于人民公社资金雄厚，可以利用飞机和拖拉机等机械造林。去年秋天用飞机在二十多华里的沙涟中播种了五万多亩齿蒿、马蓬等草子，每平方公尺发芽五百到八百株，最近又播种了两万多亩。
    中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，给三雷公社全体干部和社员向风沙大规模进军、开展粮棉超产运动，增添了无限的信心和力量。他们一致表示在中国科学院设在这里的防治试验站的指导下，充分运用公社的威力，为扩大沙区新庄，增加沙涟中的居住人口，发展果树和用材林，开辟新的农、林、牧、副、渔多种经济基地而奋斗。
