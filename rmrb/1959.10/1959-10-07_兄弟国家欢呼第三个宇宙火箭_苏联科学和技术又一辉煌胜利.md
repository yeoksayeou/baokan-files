Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The working people, scientists, and newspapers of Eastern European socialist countries, including the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Albania, warmly applaud the successful launch of the third cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union.

    The news of the Soviet Union's launch of the third cosmic rocket has added to the joyous mood of the working people of the German Democratic Republic on the eve of its tenth anniversary. At many mass rallies and gatherings held throughout the country on the 4th to celebrate the tenth anniversary, participants expressed a warm welcome to the news.

    Professor Wadenburg, director of the Treptow district observatory in Berlin, believes that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket proves that Soviet scientists have solved the most complex problems in astronautics. He pointed out that the launch of this rocket is a major step forward in solving the most complex problem of returning cosmic rockets to Earth.

    The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third cosmic rocket quickly spread throughout Czechoslovakia. At mass rallies and special meetings held in dozens of cities across the country on the morning of the 4th to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak People's Army, participants broke into thunderous applause after hearing the news and enthusiastically cheered this new achievement of Soviet science and technology. Working people from all over the country sent telegrams to the Soviet Embassy in Czechoslovakia, warmly congratulating them on this achievement.

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party organ, "Red Right Newspaper," praised the Soviet Union's automatic interplanetary station on the 5th as another brilliant victory for Soviet science and technology.

    The well-known Czechoslovak scientist, Jiří Mráček, said that the significance of the Soviet Union's launch of an automatic interplanetary station even surpasses the recent rocket landing on the moon. He emphasized that today it can be said that this scientific achievement surpasses any achievement made in this area to date.

    The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third cosmic rocket has become the main topic of conversation for Bucharest residents, as well as radio and television broadcasts.

    Dimitrescu, director of the Planetarium of the Romanian People's Republic Academy of Sciences, wrote in the evening newspaper "Bucharest News" that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket will help obtain accurate material about lunar phenomena. The successful launch of this cosmic rocket "will greatly help international cooperation in the conquest of outer space."

    The Bulgarian people welcomed the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket with great excitement. Professor Hristov, director of the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Sofia University, said that less than a month after the working people cheered the Soviet cosmic rocket reaching the moon, Soviet scientists and technicians have surprised us with a new and greater victory.

    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause Newspaper" published an editorial on the 5th saying that there is no doubt that the day is not far off when the Soviet Union will leave the United States behind in all aspects of economic development. The "People's Youth Newspaper" pointed out in an editorial that this victory achieved by Soviet scientists is a major event on the eve of the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    When the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the third cosmic rocket reached Budapest, Hungarian radio stations stopped their scheduled morning broadcasts and instead broadcast exclusively about the new achievements of Soviet science and technology. This good news greatly encouraged the working people of the Hungarian capital. The famous astronomer Shenka said that there is no doubt that with the help of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket, some valuable scientific data will be obtained, thus taking people one step further towards detailed research into the universe.

    All the newspapers in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the third cosmic rocket on the front page. "People's Forum Newspaper" published the relevant news under the headline "The world is amazed at the new achievements of Soviet science; the Soviet automatic interplanetary station is advancing in the direction of Earth-Moon-Earth," as well as special articles by some Polish scientists on the new achievements of Soviet science.

    Albanian newspapers also prominently published the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third cosmic rocket. Residents of Tirana—workers, staff, and scientific workers—praised the new achievements of Soviet science and technology.

    兄弟国家欢呼第三个宇宙火箭
    苏联科学和技术又一辉煌胜利
    新华社5日讯　德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚等东欧社会主义国家的劳动人民、科学家和报纸，热烈欢呼苏联成功发射第三个宇宙火箭。
    苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭的消息使德意志民主共和国劳动人民在建国十周年前夕增添了欢乐的情绪。4日在全国各地举行的庆祝建国十周年的许多群众大会和集会上，参加会议的人都表示热烈欢迎这个消息。
    柏林特雷普托地区的天文台台长瓦登堡教授认为，苏联第三个宇宙火箭的发射成功证明，苏联科学家解决了星际航行学中最复杂的问题。他指出，这个火箭的发射是在解决宇宙火箭返回地球这一最复杂的问题方面迈出了重要的一步。
    苏联成功地发射第三个宇宙火箭的消息很快就传遍了捷克斯洛伐克。4日上午在全国几十个城市举行的庆祝捷克斯洛伐克人民军建军节的群众大会和特别会议上，与会者在听到了这一消息后响起了暴风雨般的掌声，并为苏联科学技术的这一新成就热烈欢呼。各地劳动人民纷纷打电报给苏联驻捷克斯洛伐克大使馆，热烈祝贺这一成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”5日赞扬苏联的自动行星际站是苏联科学和技术的另一个辉煌的胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克著名科学家伊里·姆拉切克说，苏联发射自动行星际站的意义甚至超过了最近在月球着陆的火箭。他强调指出，今天已经可以说，这个科学成就超过了到目前为止在这方面所取得的任何成就。
    苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭成功的消息成了布加勒斯特居民谈话以及无线电台和电视台广播的主要题目。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国科学院天文馆馆长杰米特列斯库在晚报“布加勒斯特消息报”上写道，苏联第三个宇宙火箭的发射成功有助于获得关于月球现象的准确材料。这个宇宙火箭的发射成功“在很大程度上将有助于在征服宇宙空间方面进行国际合作”。
    保加利亚人民十分兴奋地欢迎苏联第三个宇宙火箭的发射成功。国立索非亚大学物理数学系主任赫里斯托夫教授说，劳动人民欢呼苏联宇宙火箭到达月球还不到一个月的时间，苏联科学家和技术人员又以新的、更大的胜利使我们感到惊讶。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”5日发表社论说，毫无疑问，苏联在经济发展的各个方面把美国抛到自己后面的日子已经不远了。“人民青年报”在社论中指出，苏联科学家取得的这个胜利，是伟大十月社会主义革命四十二周年前夕的一个重大事件。
    当苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭的消息传到布达佩斯后，匈牙利广播电台停止了早晨的预定广播，而专门广播苏联科学技术上的新成就。这一喜讯大大鼓舞了匈牙利首都的劳动人民。著名天文家申卡说，毫无疑问，借助于苏联第三个宇宙火箭，一定能获得一些宝贵的科学资料，从而使人们朝着详细研究宇宙方面更前进一步。
    波兰首都华沙各报都以头版头条地位刊登了苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭的消息。“人民论坛报”以“全世界为苏联科学的新成就惊奇，苏联自动行星际站向地球—月球—地球的方向前进”为题刊载了有关的消息和一些波兰科学家的论述苏联科学新成就的专文。
    阿尔巴尼亚的报纸也以显著地位刊载了苏联成功发射第三个宇宙火箭的新闻。地拉那的居民——工人、职员和科学工作者纷纷赞扬苏联科学技术的新成就。
