The U.S. Conspiracy to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs is Doomed to Fail

Da Pucheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association

Recently, under the pressure of American imperialism's dollars and with the abstention of the majority of Asian and African countries, the United Nations illegally passed a so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue," unreasonably interfering in China's internal affairs and launching a serious provocation against the Chinese people, which is truly infuriating! The crime of American imperialism in deliberately adhering to the "Cold War" and intensifying international tensions, despite the universal opposition of the people of the world, once again demonstrates that it is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. In this farce, the United Nations violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding non-interference in the internal affairs of countries, and acted as a tool for the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs. Therefore, its prestige in the minds of the Chinese people and the people of the world has further declined.

Tibet is Chinese territory, which is an undeniable historical fact. Putting down the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, safeguarding the unity of the motherland, and eliminating the extremely barbaric, reactionary, and dark serf system in Tibet, so that the Tibetan people can be reborn, fully conforms to the interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country, and therefore also safeguards the real human rights and freedom of the Tibetan people. The American ruling class has always engaged in racial discrimination and the slaughter of black people in their own country. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States has implemented a policy of bloody suppression in the colonies. Now they have the audacity to talk about "basic human rights and freedom." They are actually the spokespersons of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. What they respect is not the right and freedom of the broad masses of Tibetan people to demand democratic reforms and abolish the cannibalistic serf system, but the "rights" and "freedom" of a very small number of serf owners who attempt to maintain oppression and slaughter of serfs forever. This trick of reversing black and white can only make the people of the world more clearly recognize their reactionary nature.

The illegal resolution of the United Nations also made great efforts to slander the so-called "freedom of religious belief," but their rumors have been bankrupt in the face of facts. Over the past decade, under the brilliant light of the Chinese Communist Party's religious policy, the followers of Islam and all other religions in our country, like everyone else, have not only fully enjoyed freedom of religious belief, but have also experienced rapid development and improvement in politics, economy, and culture. The Party and the People's Government have implemented a united front policy towards religious circles, uniting all those who can be united. From our own experience, we know that the Party and the People's Government treat all ethnic groups equally and take great care of religious circles. China's 650 million people, regardless of religious or ethnic differences, are advancing by leaps and bounds along the bright road of the General Line. The American imperialists are attempting to make a big fuss about "freedom of religious belief" and carry out instigation and division. Their conspiracy will never succeed.

I wholeheartedly support our government's statement on the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly, and firmly condemn the United States for hijacking the United Nations to interfere in our internal affairs. Let the imperialists and all reactionaries clamor! Their thousand, ten thousand resolutions cannot harm a single hair of the Chinese people. No force in the world can stop the determination of the liberated Tibetan people to carry out democratic reforms. They are building their own happy and free life together with the people of other ethnic groups throughout the country.

    美国干涉中国内政的阴谋一定失败
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任　达浦生
    最近联合国在美帝国主义的金元压力和多数亚非国家弃权的情况下，非法通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议，无理干涉中国内政，向中国人民进行严重的挑衅，真令人感到无比的愤慨！美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的普遍反对而蓄意坚持“冷战”、加剧国际紧张局势的罪行，又一次说明了它是中国人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。在这幕丑剧中，联合国违反了联合国宪章关于不得干涉各国内政的规定，充当了美国干涉中国内政的工具，因此它在中国人民和世界人民心目中的威信更加下降了。
    西藏是中国的领土，这是铁定的历史事实。平定西藏上层反动集团的叛乱，维护祖国统一，并在西藏消灭极端野蛮、反动、黑暗的农奴制度，使西藏人民获得新生，这是完全符合广大西藏人民和全国人民的利益，因而也是维护了西藏人民的真正人权和自由。美国统治阶级在他们的国内一贯进行种族歧视和虏杀黑人，以美国为首的帝国主义集团在殖民地实行血腥镇压的政策，现在他们竟恬不知耻地来谈论“基本人权和自由”。他们实际上是西藏上层反动集团的代言人。他们尊重的不是广大的西藏人民要求进行民主改革、废除吃人的农奴制度的权利和自由，而是极少数的农奴主们企图永远保持压迫和屠杀农奴的“权利”和“自由”。这种颠倒黑白的伎俩，只能使全世界人民更清楚地认清他们的反动本质。
    联合国的非法决议还就所谓“宗教信仰自由”问题大肆污蔑，但是他们的谣言在事实面前破产了。十年来，在中国共产党的宗教政策的光辉照耀下，我国的伊斯兰教和一切其他宗教的信徒一样，不仅充分享受了宗教信仰自由，而且在政治上、经济上、文化上也有了迅速的发展和提高。党和人民政府对宗教界执行了统一战线的政策，团结了一切可能团结的人士。我们从亲身的体验中知道，党和人民政府对各族人民一视同仁，对宗教界照顾备至。我国六亿五千万人民，不分宗教和民族的区别，都正沿着总路线的光明大道，继续跃进。美帝国主义企图借“宗教信仰自由”大做文章，进行挑拨离间，他们的阴谋永远不能得逞。
    我衷心拥护我国政府关于联大通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明，坚决谴责美国挟持联合国干涉我国内政的行径。让帝国主义和一切反动派去叫嚣吧，他们的一千、一万个决议也损害不了中国人民的一根毫毛。世界上没有任何力量能阻止解放了的西藏人民进行民主改革的决心，他们正和全国其他各族人民一起，建设着自己幸福自由的生活。
