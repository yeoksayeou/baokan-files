　　In the evening, Grandpa was telling us the story of the Monkey King battling the Spider Demons when he suddenly stopped upon hearing drumbeats from the front of the village. He listened intently, muttering, "Who's beating the drum? Who is it...?" As he listened, he suddenly stood up and exclaimed, "Tsk! Tsk! It's the old Party Secretary beating the drum! Don't move! Listen! Listen to the rhythm: *dong*—*dong*—*qiang*, *dong*—*dong*—*qiang*, *dong*—*dong*—*dong dong dong dong dong*... This is the battle drum! If it weren't the old Party Secretary, who could drum with such vigor! Tsk! I have to go see!" With that, he threw on his jacket and dashed out the door.

　　I heard Grandpa say that the old Party Secretary was good at drumming when he was young and was a famous drummer in the village. Once he started drumming, after the three sounds of "*dong dong qiang*," there would immediately be a rain of "*dong dong dong dong*..." The drumbeats were as tight as a storm; but this storm had cadence and rhythm, tense but with a tight rhythm. This rhythm shook people's hearts, making them blood boil and their whole bodies excited! People said: This is the sound of the battle drum in wartime. The village club has a group of young percussionists, who have been drumming every night since the communization. The old Party Secretary is very busy with work and does not beat the drum easily. Once the old Party Secretary beats the drum, people are familiar with this unique battle drum sound in the whole village; so whenever the old Party Secretary beats the drum, there are always people standing around. Take my grandfather, for example, people in the village say that he has a somewhat eccentric temper, usually gets angry, and doesn't like to talk. But Grandpa and the old Party Secretary are very close, and they always have a few drinks together and chat intimately during festivals. The year before last, when the agricultural cooperative was being organized, others mobilized Grandpa to join the cooperative, but Grandpa only shook his head and waved his hands, without saying a word. But that day, after being invited by the old Party Secretary for a drink, he ran home with a flushed face and said to Dad, "Did you hear? Quickly dig out the boundary stones in the field and throw them away! Hehe! We are the first to sign up as new members of the cooperative!"

　　One day, I asked Grandpa, "Grandpa! People say that in our village, you only listen to the old Party Secretary. Why is that?"

　　Grandpa shrugged and said, "Why? When I was young, your old Party Secretary and I worked together in the landlord 'Black Miser's' house. Can I forget? Those snowy nights in winter, when I was frozen stiff in the cowshed, he held me in his arms and warmed me with the heat in his chest. When 'Black Miser' whipped me, he suddenly lay on top of me, letting 'Black Miser's' whip hit him instead... He led the village militia to fight the Japanese, he made land reform with the poor and hired peasants, he led the village in resisting America and aiding Korea, and he established the commune with everyone... Since the establishment of the Party branch in the village, he has been the secretary and has never left the villagers!"

　　The sound of gongs and drums became more and more intense. Just as I was about to rush out to see, Grandpa suddenly ran in with a newspaper in his hand. Facing the light, I saw the bright red characters on it: "Communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China". Before I could speak, Grandpa said urgently to Mom, "Quick! Quickly issue a notice to gather your 'Mu Guiying Shock Brigade' and go to the East Square to await assignments!"

　　The drumbeats became more and more intense. In front of the village, the lights on the "Leap Forward Gate" were brilliant, illuminating the ten characters "People's Commune is Good, Great Leap Forward" with dazzling light! Directly in front of the "Leap Forward Gate," in the vast fields by the Yi River, was a landscape of lights and bonfires. The firelight moved, covering the sky, vying with the stars in the night sky. In a daze, one couldn't tell whether it was the night sky or the earth. Countless people swayed in the firelight. Horns, whistles, shouts, and songs swept across the night sky in waves...

　　"Hey! You leader of the Third Squad, listen up: What is the Great Leap Forward? What is continuing the Great Leap Forward? Have you heard the old Party Secretary's report? Hehe! You little brats! Let me tell you clearly: Thirty acres of millet in the Southeast Ditch here have already been threshed! By tomorrow morning, when the red sun jumps out, we will not only have threshed the millet, but also have had a good sleep. What about you? Maybe you'll just be starting to crawl home! What 'not too late'! What 'not in a hurry'! To put it bluntly, it's just slowly leaning to the right! Hey ha! Harvest quickly, young men! I ask you: Have you ever seen such heavy millet ears in previous years? Tsk! Tsk! Everyone look! Our old Party Secretary is drumming!"

　　This was clearly Grandpa's voice. Just as I was about to run over there, I saw the old Party Secretary and the others coming across the "Leap Forward Gate." The old Party Secretary's face was flushed, his silver beard was shaking, he had a drum hanging around his neck, and his hands were tightly holding drumsticks. He opened his arms and started drumming like rain. The *dong dong dong* drumbeats resounded through the night sky, shaking Mount Yimeng, and echoing unceasingly towards the depths of the fields.

    鼓声
    应选
    晚上，爷爷正给我们讲着孙悟空大战蜘蛛精的故事，听到村前鼓声，忽然住口了。他一边侧耳倾听，一边念叨：“这是谁打的鼓呢？这是谁……？”听着听着，刷地一下子站起来，说：“啧！啧！这是老支书擂的鼓！不要动！你们听！听这鼓点：咚——咚——锵，咚——咚——锵，咚——咚——咚咚咚咚咚……这是战鼓呀！不是老支书，谁能打出这股子劲！啧！我得出去瞧瞧！”说罢，他把褂儿一披，飞也似地跨过大门。
    我听爷爷讲过：老支书年轻时就会擂鼓，是村里出名的鼓手。他一擂起鼓来，敲过“咚咚锵”三声之后，紧接着就是雨点般的“咚咚咚咚……”。鼓声紧的像掀起一阵暴风雨；可是这暴风雨又抑扬有度，紧张中而有严密的节奏。这节奏震撼着人们的心，使人热血沸腾，浑身激动！人们都说：这是战斗时的战鼓声。村里俱乐部有一班青年锣鼓手，自公社化以来，天天晚上总要敲打些时候。老支书工作挺忙，并不轻易擂鼓。一旦老支书擂鼓，人们却又都熟悉这全村独一无二的战鼓声；所以每逢老支书擂鼓时，周围总是站满了人。就拿我爷爷来说吧，村里人都说他脾气有点儿古怪，平常爱生气，不爱说话。可是爷爷和老支书挺要好，逢年过节时，他们总要到一块儿喝几盅酒，聊聊知心话儿。前年组织农业社，别人动员爷爷入社，爷爷除去摇头摆手之外，只是不吱声。可是那天给老支书约去喝了一次酒，红着脸奔回家来，和爸爸说：“听见没？快把地里界石挖出扔了！嘻嘻！咱是第一个报名的新社员哩！”
    一天，我问爷爷：“爷爷！人家都说：在咱村里，你只听老支书一个人的话，这是为啥呀？”
    爷爷耸了耸肩，说：“为啥？年轻的时候，我和你老支书爷爷，一块儿在地主‘黑财迷’家扎生活。我能忘记吗？那些个冬天雪夜里，我在牛棚里被冻僵了，他把我抱在怀里，用胸中的热气暖醒了我。‘黑财迷’用皮鞭抽我的时候，他一下子伏在我身上，让‘黑财迷’的皮鞭抽在他身上……领导村里民兵打鬼子的是他，和贫雇农一块儿闹土改的是他，领导村里抗美援朝的是他，和大伙一块儿办公社的是他……自打村里建立党支部，他就是书记，始终没离开村里人呀！”
    锣鼓声一阵阵紧。我正要窜出去瞧瞧，爷爷忽然大步跑进来，手里拿着一张报纸，迎着灯光，我看准上面几个鲜红的大字：“中国共产党八届八中全会公报”。没容得我说话，爷爷就急促地对妈妈说：“快！快去下通知，把你们‘穆桂英突击队’集合起来，到东场上听候分派！”
    鼓声越擂越紧。村前，“跃进门”上面灯火辉煌，把“人民公社好，生产大跃进”十个大字照耀得光辉夺目！“跃进门”的正前方，沂水河畔的辽阔田野里，是一片漫布着的灯光和篝火。火光游动着，遍及天际，和夜空的星星争辉。一迷眼，就分不清那是夜空，那是大地了。无数人群，在火光里晃动。号声、口哨声、吆喝声、歌声，一阵阵掠过夜空……。
    “喂！第三小队那个领头的听着：什么叫大跃进？什么叫继续大跃进？你们听过老支书的传达报告没有？嘿嘿！你们这些小崽子呀！明告诉你们说：我们这里，东南洼三十亩谷子已经登场啦！赶到明天早晨，红红太阳跳出来，我们除了谷子登场之外，还要睡个大好觉。你们呢？你们也许才开始往家爬哩！什么‘晚不了’呀！什么‘急不得’呀！说穿了，不过是慢吞吞儿向右歪呀！嘿哈！快割吧，小伙子们！我问你们：往年见过这么沉的谷穗没有呢？啧！啧！大伙瞧呀！咱老支书擂鼓来啦！”
    这分明是爷爷的声音。我正要向那边奔去，只见老支书他们已跨过“跃进门”而来。老支书满面红光，银须抖动，怀里挂着大鼓，两手攥紧鼓棰，张开两臂，落雨般地擂打起来。咚咚咚的鼓声，响彻夜空，震撼着沂蒙山，向着田野深处不住地响着。
