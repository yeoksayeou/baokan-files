　　Watching Ulanova Perform "Giselle"
　　Tian Han
Two years ago, while celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Comrade Mei Lanfang and I visited Comrade Ulanova at the Moscow Grand Theatre, hoping she could attend our 10th National Day celebration. Comrade Ulanova said she would definitely come, but added, "Ballet is a cruel art, I don't know if I'll still be able to dance then?" This time she has indeed come to Beijing, sparing no effort to give Beijing audiences a wonderfully brilliant performance. Our gratitude is twofold. I write this after watching the play last night to record my excitement.

　　I.
　　In the mountain village, a secluded bird sings, and a distant castle is seen,
　　A handsome young man comes gracefully, gently knocking on the humble door;
　　The beautiful Giselle, with joy animating her face,
　　Her slender waist is freely lifted, her beautiful hair is caressed at will;
　　Why bother consulting flower petals, her heart has already been promised.
　　The hunting party includes a beauty, her long dress glittering with amber,
　　Offering a necklace with great care, its brilliance never seen before,
　　Hans arrives proudly, with a sword in his hand,
　　Only then does one realize that the flower of love is actually a heartbroken poison!
　　The young man is already married, Luo Fu suffers humiliation,
　　Like a ship sailing in stormy waves, suddenly losing its mast;
　　As if encountering fierce wind and rain, flowers fall and are abandoned to the dust;
　　Crushing the heart of a young girl, when will this regret be remedied?

　　II.
　　Fireflies fly across the wild fields, the cold forest meets midnight,
　　A flower crown adorns the faint moon, autumn graves hold ghostly dances,
　　Madder grass is offered to the ghost king, a mournful laugh lifts golden threads;
　　Pitiful Wilis, still longing for the maiden's shore.
　　The young man quietly arrives, pouring out his heart at the grave,
　　Touched by this unbroken love, saving you from the ghost's domain,
　　The morning light will soon dawn, this farewell is never to be repeated,
　　Thank you for remembering me, blowing out the extinguished candle,
　　Small flowers are thrown to you, red tears suddenly like rain.

　　III.
　　The whole city is amazed by the wonderful skill, thousands of hands applaud like rapid drums.
　　Your art is like beautiful sculpture, without seeing chisel or axe,
　　Light as drifting catkins, agile as soaring feathers;
　　Raising hands shows spirit, stamping feet expresses joy and anger;
　　Emotions are abundant within, revealed involuntarily;
　　The brushwork is extremely unrestrained, yet within the rules,
　　Like viewing a Repin painting, how vivid the spirit;
　　Like reading Pushkin, every word is a pearl and jade utterance.
　　I am touched by your true faith, still remembering the old promise,
　　Visiting the new China again, the National Day celebration reaches its second five-year mark,
　　Sharing joy with me, lending your remaining strength for my sake;
　　The friendship between China and the Soviet Union, becomes even closer like water and milk,
　　Bestowing upon us new dance skills, its profoundness is difficult to estimate!
　　I dash off this small poem to ease your hard work.

　　观乌兰诺娃演“吉赛尔”
　　田汉
    前年庆祝苏联十月革命四十年纪念时，曾与梅兰芳同志访乌兰诺娃同志于莫斯科大剧院，并希望她能来参加我建国十周年，乌兰诺娃同志说她一定来，但说：“芭蕾是残酷的艺术，不知那时还跳得动不？”此次她果然来到北京，不辞辛苦，对北京观众作了精彩无比的演出，我们的感谢是双重的，昨晚观剧回来写此以志激动。
　　一
　　山村啼幽鸟，遥见城堡古，
　　翩翩来年少，轻轻叩蓬户；
　　窈窕吉赛尔，欢悦动眉宇，
　　纤腰任高举，秀发恣爱抚；
　　何必卜花瓣，此心已相许。
　　猎队有美人，长裙耀晶琥，
　　殷勤赠项链，灿烂所未睹，
　　汉斯昂然来，手出剑一股，
　　才知同心草，竟是断肠蛊！
　　公子已有妇，罗敷受欺侮，
　　如船行骇浪，忽然失樯橹；
　　如遭风雨恶，花落委尘土；
　　揉碎少女心，此恨何时补？
　　二
　　流萤飞野莽，寒林值夜午，
　　花冠戴微月，秋坟鬼艳舞，
　　茜草供鬼王，凄笑提金缕；
　　可怜威利斯，犹恋女儿浦。
　　公子悄然至，坟头诉肺腑，
　　感此情不断，救君出鬼府，
　　晨光将曦微，此别不再聚，
　　承君相忆慕，吹起已灭炷，
　　小花投向君，红泪忽如雨。
　　三
　　举都惊妙技，万掌发急鼓。
　　君艺如美塑，不见凿与斧，
　　轻如随风絮，矫若冲天羽；
　　举手见性灵，投足生喜怒；
　　情感沛于内，流露不自主；
　　用笔极奔放，而又中规矩，
　　如观列宾画，神彩何栩栩；
　　如读普希金，字字珠玉吐。
　　感君真信人，旧约犹记取，
　　再访新中国，国诞值二五，
　　欢乐与我共，余勇为我贾；
　　中苏兄弟谊，得此更水乳，
　　惠我新舞艺，深厚难以估！
　　走笔成小诗，聊以慰劳苦。
