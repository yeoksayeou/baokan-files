    Growth
    By our staff reporter Yu Huiyin
    I visited the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
    In this large mechanical factory with more than 6,000 workers, I not only saw the soaring development of production, but also saw how a group of socialist new people—conscious working-class intellectuals who have mastered cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge—are growing rapidly along with the young socialist factory. All of this left my excited heart unable to calm down for a long time.
            Nine Years Like One Day
    Saturday night, the night was deep, and the surroundings were silent. In a room in the staff dormitory of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the light was on. Seeing the innocent, lively, and smiling children sleeping sweetly one by one, Huang Jixiang, a technician from a worker's background and a Communist Party member, tiptoed out of bed. First, he opened his textbooks and notes to review the lessons taught by the amateur school teachers, and then he concentrated on doing the exercises. For this old worker with twenty-nine years of work experience and rich practical experience in production, the content of courses such as mechanical principles and metal technology was relatively easy to understand, but courses such as theoretical mechanics and differential equations were much more unfamiliar and difficult to learn. At the moment, he encountered such a differential equation problem: "A lamp is hung in the center of a circular field with a diameter of 30 meters. Assuming that the intensity of the light is proportional to the cosine of the angle and inversely proportional to the distance from the illuminated point, how high should this lamp be hung to illuminate a small path along the edge of the circular field the brightest?" Huang Jixiang calculated it over and over again but couldn't get it done. The more he couldn't do it, the less he was willing to give up. Once, twice… he kept doing it, and after three or four hours, he finally came up with the correct answer. Only then did he raise his head with a happy smile and breathe a sigh of relief. Ah, before he knew it, dawn had broken.
    Huang Jixiang had only studied in a private school for a few years in the past, and only knew addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in mathematics. In the spring of 1950, when a branch of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant began to jointly establish a staff amateur school with four units outside the factory, he happily signed up for admission. Although his professional work and social work were very busy and time was tight, he always squeezed out every available moment to study without affecting his work. There was a period when he worked in Beixinqiao. After work, he immediately rode his bicycle to Tianqiao, more than ten miles away, to attend class. In order not to be late, he always took a steamed bun to class and ate it during the break, and then went home for dinner after school. There were many formulas in math courses, especially trigonometry. He could understand what was taught in class, but he would forget it after a long time. Huang Jixiang wrote all the formulas he had learned in a small notebook and carried it with him. He wrote the newly learned formulas in large characters and pasted them on the walls of his home. Whether he was eating or resting in the morning or evening, as long as he had time, he would read it once, memorize it once, and recite it silently once. After repeated practice, he still remembers these formulas he learned three or four years ago very well.
    At first, Huang Jixiang's wife saw him studying various cultural and scientific knowledge eagerly and self-studying until twelve o'clock at night, unwilling to rest. She was afraid that he was too tired, so she deliberately turned off the lights to prevent him from studying. She also advised him, "Why are you still studying at such an old age! Can't you work without studying?" Huang Jixiang patiently said to her, "We workers can't always be uneducated! If we don't master culture and science, how can we be good masters of the new society and how can we do more work for the Party!" His wife slowly understood. Later, when she saw that her husband was sometimes relatively free, she urged him to do his homework quickly.
    For nine years like one day, Huang Jixiang has always insisted on amateur cultural learning. Except for urgent work meetings, he has never asked for leave from his studies. In the past eight years, he has learned all the basic courses in junior high school and high school classes and some of the professional courses in the secondary technical school class, starting from the four arithmetic operations of integers in elementary school language and elementary school arithmetic. Now he is a student of the Beijing Institute of Mechanical Engineering Night University. He is the leader of the rationalization proposal group in the factory, specifically leading the factory to carry out technological revolution, research and treatment of rationalization proposals, technical information exchange inside and outside the factory, and other important technical work. The summary of the factory's rationalization proposal work in 1956 and 1957, the summary of the technical revolution movement in 1958, and the summary of technical information work were all written by him. When considering the technical innovations such as improving safety hooks for employees, he not only judges based on his own practical experience, but also can use the book knowledge he has learned to analyze and calculate.
            Old But Vigorous
    The work of trial-producing the important new product ×52K vertical milling machine encountered a major obstacle in the gear processing link: the number of gear teeth required for this vertical milling machine was as high as two hundred and sixty, and none of the gear machine tools in the mass production workshop's gear section could process such large gears. People inside and outside the workshop were very anxious.
    Yang Xuekong, an old worker in the gear section and a high school student in the staff amateur school, was also thinking hard at this time: Is it possible to use existing equipment to produce this large gear? How can this be done? He thought, if the production conditions have changed, the transmission relationship should also change accordingly. The dividing gear for general workpieces is four, and Yang Xuekong boldly used the algebra knowledge he learned in the amateur school to calculate a set of transmission relationships suitable for processing this large gear, increasing the number of dividing gears to six. However, this led to a new problem: the rotation direction of the worktable was reversed, and normal production could not be carried out. What to do? Yang Xuekong, who had made an in-depth study of the machine tool transmission diagram, came up with a solution: using the original bevel gear differential device on the machine tool, he corrected the rotation direction of the worktable. After repeated experiments, the new large gear was finally successfully produced on the original machine tool, and the key problem in the trial production of the ×52K vertical milling machine was solved.
    Yang Xuekong is fifty years old this year and has been working for thirty-six years. Last year, he was promoted from an eighth-grade technician to a technician, and then he became the head of the section, leading more than 200 workers, specializing in the gear department of the batch workshop that produces various gears. Gear production involves a lot of mathematical knowledge. Yang Xuekong, who has rich experience, had only studied in a private school for more than a year in the past and could not calculate, often knowing what it was but not knowing why. After the factory started the school, Yang Xuekong immediately became one of the first students. In the classroom, among a large group of young men and girls, you could always see this respectable old master with gray hair, wearing a pair of reading glasses, listening attentively to every word the teacher said and carefully taking notes. In the past few years, Yang Xuekong has studied from junior high school to high school in the staff amateur school, learning mathematics, physics, and other courses, and his mind has become more open. He not only studies the knowledge he has learned carefully, striving to understand it thoroughly and learn it firmly, but also often applies it to production. At the end of last year, the factory needed to produce a large number of twisted gears, but the existing twisted gear milling machines were insufficient. Yang Xuekong and Zhang Moran, a technician from a worker's background and a student in the secondary technical school class of the staff amateur school, used the newly learned knowledge of trigonometry, calculus, and mechanical principles to modify a fixture and install it on a vertical milling machine, cleverly replacing the twisted gear milling machine and solving the problem of insufficient equipment. This creation was rated as a first-class prize in the factory.
    Advanced Producer - Poet "...The whistle is the prelude to this ensemble, its crisp sound spreading and vibrating in the morning sky, announcing the beginning of a day's work. Then, the sun, like a ball of fire, slowly rises into the sky.
    ××××
    Thousands of faces are flushed with red,
    Thousands of motors sing in unison,
    This is the magnificent symphony of production,
    A movement that will never be finished..."
    This is an excerpt from the poem "Touching Music" by Wen Chengxun, a young worker in the batch workshop.
    When Wen Chengxun, seventeen, entered the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant as an apprentice in 1952, he was a completely ignorant elementary school graduate in machine tool production technology. In just seven years, through the Party's kind cultivation and his own hard work, he has grown into a sixth-grade skilled worker, a Communist Party member, and an amateur university student. From 1956 to the present, he has been rated as an advanced producer in the factory's annual production competition, and he has also been rated as a good student by the staff amateur school. What makes the staff of the machine tool plant particularly happy is that the young Wen Chengxun has not only become an excellent worker with consciousness and technology, but also has become an outstanding worker's amateur poetry creator.
    The joyful and heroic production labor and the heroic images of thousands of advanced workers have promoted Wen Chengxun's creative desire and become an inexhaustible source of creation for him. When he first entered the factory, while working as a propagandist in the workshop, Wen Chengxun began to write some short articles, poems, drum lyrics, and small plays for publication on the blackboard newspaper or broadcasting station. His literary creation, especially the creation of poetry, attracted people's attention. Soon, his short poem "Singing the Red Flag," was published in the newspaper after being recommended by the Party committee. Since then, under the care and encouragement of the Party organization and all parties, he has successively written one or two hundred poems, many of which have been published in newspapers and magazines. "Touching Music," which praises production labor, "Small Calipers," which describes the different experiences of two generations of workers through a production tool, "Absolute Champion," which cheers the great achievements of the Soviet artificial satellite, and "Evergreen Pine," which praises the glorious image of retired veteran workers, have all been compiled into the "Poetry Selection" in 1956, 1957, and 1958 by the Chinese Writers Association respectively.
            Not Isolated Cases
    The growth of Huang Jixiang, Yang Xuekong, and Wen Chengxun is not an isolated example in the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
    In 1951, the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, which was merged from several small repair shops, could only produce simple machines such as water pumps, iron dump trucks, and cement mixers. At that time, 62% of the factory's employees were illiterate or semi-literate.
    Today, the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has developed into a modern factory that produces a variety of high-end machine tools. The huge eight-meter gantry planer, the precision 528 twisted gear milling machine, and the latest program-controlled milling machine have all been successfully trial-produced here. The literacy classes and elementary school classes that were founded eight years ago have developed into a complete and huge staff amateur education system from elementary school to university. In these few years, more than 60% of the employees have improved their cultural level by two grades through unremitting amateur learning, that is, from elementary school to junior high school, and from elementary school to high school. Most of the remaining employees who participated in the study have also improved by one grade. At present, half of the factory's employees have reached a cultural level equivalent to junior high school, and nearly a quarter of the employees have reached the level of high school and junior college. More than 80% of the employees participating in amateur study are studying in junior high school, high school, secondary technical school, and university classes. Among the factory's leaders above the section chief level, those from worker backgrounds account for 62%, and those from worker backgrounds account for 10% of the technical personnel. When they were first promoted, their cultural level was mostly equivalent to elementary school, but now most of them are equivalent to high school and university. The workers proudly compiled a jingle to describe their study life after work: "Take off the work clothes and enter the classroom, wash the oily hands and become students, lathe, fitter, milling, and planing can all be done, physics and chemistry are all proficient."

    成长
    本报记者　余辉音
    我访问了北京第一机床厂。
    在这个拥有六千多工人的大型机械工厂里，不仅看到了生产的飞跃发展，而且看到一批社会主义的新人——有觉悟的、掌握文化科学技术的工人阶级知识分子，怎样随着年轻的社会主义工厂一起迅速地成长。这一切，使我激动的心情久久不能平息。
            九年如一日
    星期六的晚上，夜已深，四周一片寂静。第一机床厂职工宿舍的一间屋子里，灯光亮着。看到天真活泼、爱笑爱闹的孩子们一个个甜甜地睡熟了，工人出身的技师、共产党员黄吉祥轻手轻脚从床上起来。先打开课本和笔记，把业余学校教师讲的课复习一遍，然后就集中精力做起习题来了。对于这个已有二十九年工龄和丰富的生产实际经验的老工人来说，机械原理、金属工艺学等课程的内容倒还比较容易理解，理论力学、微分方程这些课程却要生疏得多，学起来也困难得多。眼前，就碰到这样一个微分方程习题：“电灯挂在直径为三十米圆场的中央，假定灯光的强度与角的余弦成正比，而与被照点的距离成反比，问这个灯挂多高才能将圆场边沿的一条小路照得最亮？”黄吉祥左算右算怎么也做不出。愈是做不出，他愈不肯罢休，一遍、两遍……做下去，一连做了三、四个钟头，终于得出了正确的答案。这才带着愉快的微笑抬起头来松了一口气。呀，不知不觉，天已破晓了。
    黄吉祥过去只读过几年私塾，数学只会加减乘除。1950年春，第一机床厂的一个分厂开始和厂外四个单位联合成立职工业余学校时，他就欢欢喜喜地报名入了学。尽管业务工作和社会工作都很忙，时间紧得很，他总是在不影响工作的情况下挤出一切可利用的时间来学习。有一个时期，他在北新桥上班，下班后立刻骑上自行车赶到十多里以外的天桥去上课，为了不迟到，每次都总是拿着一个馒头去上课，留在休息时吃，放学后再回家吃晚饭。数学课程特别是三角课，公式多，课上讲的能懂，时间一长却会忘掉。黄吉祥就把学到的公式都写在小本子上，揣在身边，新学到的公式都用大字写出来，贴在家里的墙壁上，不论早晚吃饭休息，只要有空，就读一遍，记一遍，默一遍。经过反复练习，三、四年前学过的这些公式，他至今还记得很牢。
    起初，黄吉祥的妻子看他如饥如渴地学习各种文化科学知识，晚上常常自修到十二点还不肯休息，怕他太累了，故意把电灯熄掉，让他学不成。还劝他说：你这么大年岁还学什么啊！不学习不也能工作吗？黄吉祥就耐心地对她说：我们工人不能老当大老粗啊，不掌握文化科学，怎么能当好新社会的主人，怎么能为党多做些工作呢！妻子慢慢想通了，到后来看到丈夫有时比较空闲，倒催他快做功课了。
    九年如一日，黄吉祥始终坚持了业余文化学习，除因紧急的工作会议外，学习上从未请过假。八年来，他从高小语文和小学算术上的整数四则学起，学完了初中和高中班的全部基础课和中技班的一部分专业课程。现在他已是北京机械学院夜大学的一个学生，在厂内担任着合理化建议组组长，具体领导着全厂开展技术革命、合理化建议的研究处理、厂内外技术情报交流等重要的技术工作。1956、57年全厂合理化建议工作总结、1958年技术革命运动总结、技术情报工作总结就是他写的。在考虑职工们改进安全吊钩等等技术革新时，他不光是凭自己的实际经验来判断，而且能运用学到的书本知识来分析、计算了。
            老当益壮
    试制重要的新产品×52K立铣床的工作，在齿轮加工这个环节中遇到了一个很大的障碍：这种立铣床上所需要的齿轮齿数多到二百六十多个，在成批车间齿轮工段现有的齿轮机床中没有一部可以加工这种大齿轮。车间里外的人都非常焦急。
    齿轮工段老工人、职工业余学校高中班学员杨学孔这时也在苦苦思索：是否能利用现有设备把这种大齿轮生产出来？怎样才能做到这点呢？他想，生产条件变了，传动关系也该随着改变。一般工作物的分齿挂轮是四个，杨学孔大胆运用在业余学校里学到的代数知识计算出一套适合加工这种大齿轮的传动关系，将分齿挂轮的数目增加到六个。但是，这样一来又遇到了新的问题：工作台的转动方向变反了，不能进行正常生产。怎么办？对机床传动图作了深入钻研的杨学孔又想出了办法，利用机床上原有的铣伞齿轮的差动装置，把工作台的转动方向纠正过来。经过反复的试验，新的大齿轮终于在原有机床上成功地生产出来，×52K立铣床试制中的关键问题解决了。
    杨学孔今年已有五十岁，工龄也有三十六年了。前年他已由一个八级技术工人被提升为技术员，接着又担任了工段长，领导着二百多工人，专门生产各种齿轮的成批车间齿轮工部。齿轮生产接触到许多数学知识，经验丰富的杨学孔过去只读过一年多私塾，不会计算，常常是知其然而不知其所以然。工厂办学后，杨学孔立刻成了第一批学员之一，在课堂上，在一大群年轻的小伙子和姑娘们中间，总是可以看到这位头发斑白的受人尊敬的老师傅，带着一副老花眼镜，精神奕奕地听着教师讲的每一句话，仔细地记着笔记。几年来，杨学孔在职工业余学校由初中一直读到高中，学习了数学、物理等课程，脑子越发开了窍。学到的知识，他不仅细心钻研，力求懂得透彻，学得巩固，还经常运用到生产中去。去年年底，工厂需要大量生产扭齿轮，可是现有扭齿铣床不足，杨学孔就和工人出身的技师、职工业余学校中技班学员张沫然一道，运用新学到的三角、微积分和机械原理的知识，改装了一种胎具装在立铣床上，巧妙地代替了扭齿铣床，解决了设备不足的困难。这项创造在厂内被评为一等奖。先进生产者——诗人“……汽笛是这合奏的序曲，清脆的声音在晨空里传播震荡，她宣布一天劳动的开始，跟着，火球似的太阳缓缓升到天上。××××
    几千人的脸上泛着红光，
    几千个马达同声歌唱，
    这就是雄壮的生产交响曲，
    是一篇永远也奏不完的乐章。……”
    这是成批车间青年工人温承训的诗“动人的音乐”中的一段。
    1952年，十七岁的温承训考进第一机床厂当学徒工的时候，是一个完全不懂机床生产技术的高小毕业生。短短的七年中，经过党的亲切培养和自己的刻苦努力，他已成长为一个六级技术工人，共产党员，业余大学学生，从1956年到现在，每年的生产竞赛中都被评为全厂的先进生产者，还被职工业余学校评为好学员。使得机床厂职工们特别高兴的是，年轻的温承训不但成了一个有觉悟有技术的优秀工人，而且成了一个出色的工人业余诗歌创作者。
    欢乐豪迈的生产劳动，千千万万先进工人的英雄形象推动了温承训的创作愿望，同时成了他取之不尽、用之不竭的创作泉源。刚进厂那年，在车间担任宣传员的社会工作的时候，温承训就开始写一些短文、小诗、鼓词、小型剧本在黑板报或广播台上发表。他的文艺创作，特别是诗的创作才能引起了人们的注意，不久，他的一首“歌唱红旗”的短诗，经过党委的推荐，在报上发表了。从那时起，他在党组织和各方面的关怀鼓励下陆续写了一、二百首诗歌，其中不少已在报刊上发表。歌颂生产劳动的“动人的音乐”、通过一件生产工具描述两代工人不同遭遇的“小卡钳”、欢呼苏联人造卫星巨大成就的“绝对冠军”以及歌颂退休老工人光辉形象的“不老松”等几首诗，还被中国作家协会分别编入1956、1957和1958年“诗选”中。
            不是个别的
    黄吉祥、杨学孔、温承训的成长，在北京第一机床厂并不是个别的例子。
    1951年，由几个小修械所合并起来的北京第一机床厂，还只能生产水泵、铁斗车、水泥搅拌机等简单机器。那时，全厂有62％的职工是文盲和半文盲。
    今天，第一机床厂已经发展成为一个生产多品种高级机床的现代化工厂。巨大的八米龙门刨床、精密的528扭齿铣床，最新式的程序控制铣床，都在这里试制成功。八年前创办的扫盲识字班和高小班，已经发展成为由初小到大学的一套完整的庞大的职工业余教育体系。就在这几年，60％以上的职工经过坚持不懈的业余学习，文化水平提高了二级，就是说，由初小提高到初中，高小提高到高中，其余参加学习的职工也大都提高了一级。目前全厂已有一半的职工达到了相当初中的文化水平，有将近四分之一的职工达到了高中和大专的水平。参加业余学习的职工80％以上在初中、高中、中技和大学班学习。全厂科长级以上领导干部中，工人出身的已占62％，技术人员中工人出身的也达到了10％，刚提拔时，他们的文化程度大都相当高小，现在大部分已相当高中和大学了。工人自豪地编了一首顺口溜来描绘他们劳动之余的学习生活：“脱下工装进课堂，洗净油手学生当，车、钳、铣、刨都能干，物理化学全在行。”（附图片）
