　　US Plunders Mexican Sulfur on a Large Scale

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, 16th. TASS, Mexico City, 15th: The Mexican newspaper "El Informador" published an article by writer and journalist Spota, explaining how American companies are plundering Mexico's national wealth.

Spota wrote: American companies mining sulfur in Mexico extract 3,300 tons per day. According to reliable estimates, this sulfur is worth $66,000.

According to concessions signed with the United States during difficult times in Mexico's past, these American companies should give Mexico 40% of the profits, which amounts to $26,400 per day. However, they actually only pay 5% of the profits (i.e., $3,300). This sulfur is shipped to the United States, and Mexico then has to import it back from the United States at a high price when it is needed.

　　美国大肆掠夺墨西哥的硫磺
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社墨西哥城15日电：墨西哥“消息报”刊登了作家兼记者斯波塔的一篇文章，说明美国公司怎样在掠夺墨西哥的民族财富。
    斯波塔写道：美国在墨西哥开采硫磺的公司每天开采量达三千三百吨。据可靠估计，这些硫磺价值六万六千美元。
    根据过去在墨西哥困难时期中同美国签定的租让协定，这些美国公司应当交给墨西哥40％的利润，即每天给墨西哥二万六千四百美元。但是，它们实际上只付给5％（即三千三百美元）的利润。这些硫磺运往美国，而墨西哥在必要用时又不得不用高价再从美国进口。
