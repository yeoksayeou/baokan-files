    Seething Mines
  　Zhong Liu
    Song of the Coal Rush
    Chairman Mao issued a battle order,
    Like lightning, like thunder, like a storm, like surging waves…
    Mountains, oh, I am coming!
    Make way for me to go into battle.
    Water gun, oh, my water gun,
    What a frame of steel and iron!
    Rocks, no matter how hard,
    Cannot be harder than my will
    And the determination to swallow mountains and rivers.
    Rumbling, like a mountain collapsing,
    Coal waves roll out of the mine,
    I ride the black dragon to Beijing.
    In front of Tiananmen, give Chairman Mao the good news:
    Glorious results, ten thousand tons a day…
    Mine, oh, mine, please bear witness for us:
    One gun holds a thousand rivers,
    One car is filled with the spring of ten thousand homes.
      Changing Guard
    Handing the rifle to a comrade,
    I bid farewell to the frontier island,
    Carrying the honor of a soldier to change guard,
    I return to my hometown coal mine to report.
    In the sniper battle on Shangganling,
    I blocked the howling of steel;
    Guarding the gateway of the motherland,
    Not a single enemy escaped from the gun sight.
    Ten years of fighting north and south,
    The fire of war has forged me taller,
    Advancing from the frontier to the mine,
    Is my response to the Party's call.
    There has never been a road underground,
    I will create it.
    Party, oh, I want to inherit the cause of my fathers,
    Please give me a windlass.
    I will use the hands that extinguished the flames of war,
    To open the way for socialist construction,
    To realize Chairman Mao's grand plan,
    I am willing to work for this until my hair turns white…
    Combine Operator
    In a charging posture,
    Use cannons to blast the stone gate open.
    The coal field opens its chest,
    Like a boundless sea.
    Start the combine and advance,
    Like a fast ship breaking through the waves…
    Coal sea, coal waves blossom,
    The more you open, the more you love.
    Ten thousand tons of coal do not leave the well,
    The hero does not leave the driver's seat.

    沸腾的矿山
  　中流
    夺煤战歌毛主席下来一道战斗令，像闪电，像雷鸣，像风暴，像浪涌……高山呵，我来了！快闪开让我上阵。水枪呵我的水枪，好一副钢骨铁筋，岩石，再硬，也硬不过我的意志和气吞山河的决心。轰隆隆，像山崩，煤浪滚滚出矿井，我跨黑龙进北京。天安门前，给毛主席送喜讯：战果辉煌，日夺万吨……矿井呵，矿井，请为我们作证：一枪容得千江水，一车装满万家春。
      换岗把枪杆交给战友，我告别边防海岛，带着军人的荣誉换岗，我回故乡的煤矿报到。上甘岭上狙击战斗，我挡过钢铁的呼啸；守卫祖国的大门口，一个敌人也没从枪眼跑掉。南征北战十年岁月，炮火锤炼使我长高了，从边防向矿井进军，是我应着党的号召。自古地下就无路没有的，我创造，党呵，我要继承父辈的事业，请发给我一把风镐。我要用扑灭战火的手，为社会主义建设开道，实现毛主席的宏伟计划，我愿为此干到白发飘飘……
    康拜因手以冲锋陷阵姿态，用炮把石门崩开。煤田敞开了胸怀，像没边没沿大海。开动康拜因前进，如快舰破浪而来……煤海煤浪浪花开，越开越多越心爱。万吨煤炭不出井，英雄不下驾驶台。
