Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, New York Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower discussed the issue of an East-West summit conference at a press conference held in Augusta, Georgia yesterday.

    A reporter asked Eisenhower whether he had suggested holding an East-West summit conference in December of this year. The reporter also said that it now seemed that the British favored the idea of holding an East-West summit conference in the near future, while France wanted to wait until next spring. Someone also asked Eisenhower whether he hoped for a meeting of Western leaders before an East-West summit conference in the coming weeks.

    In answering these questions, Eisenhower denied that he had actually suggested holding an East-West summit conference or a Western conference before the summit at a specific time.

    He said he had no strong feelings about the timing of an East-West summit conference. He said he was ready to attend a Western summit conference at any time from now on. He believed that a Western summit conference must be held before any other summit conference so that their positions could be consistent. Once this was done, he would be ready to attend an East-West summit conference.

    Eisenhower said he thought it would be a good idea to hold an East-West summit conference at the end of this year. However, he repeated that he had not suggested any specific time.

    He said the longer the Western summit conference was delayed, the further the date of the East-West summit conference would be pushed back.

    In answering questions, Eisenhower once again attempted to distort the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory of Taiwan into a so-called "international dispute" between "Formosa—Communist China," and insisted that this dispute was a so-called "international threat to peace."

    At the press conference, Eisenhower also defended his use of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to suppress the strike by American steelworkers. He admitted that the Taft-Hartley Act did not have a very glorious history, but he insisted that he had no other choice but to invoke this law.

    艾森豪威尔谈最高级会议

    诬蔑我解放台湾的决心是对和平的“威胁”
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天在佐治亚州奥古斯大城举行的记者招待会上谈到东西方最高级会议问题。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，他是否曾建议在今年12月举行东西方最高级会议。记者又说，现在似乎英国人赞成在最近期间召开东西方最高级会议的主张，而法国却想等到明年春天召开。还有人问艾森豪威尔，他是否希望在最近几个星期内举行东西方最高级会议之前的西方领导人会议。
    艾森豪威尔在回答这些问题时否认他实际上已经建议在某一个固定时间内举行东西方最高级会议或最高级会议之前的西方会议。
    他说，他对举行东西方最高级会议的时间并无强烈的情绪。他说，他准备从现在起，随时参加西方最高级会议。他认为，在举行任何其他的最高级会议之前，必须举行一次西方的最高级会议，以便使它们的立场一致。一旦这样做了，他将准备参加东西方最高级会议。
    艾森豪威尔说，他认为，如果在今年年底举行东西方最高级会议，将是一个好主意。但是，他重复说，他没有建议任何具体时间。
    他说，西方最高级会议推迟得越久，东西方高级会议的日期也就推得更远。
    艾森豪威尔在回答问题时又一次企图把中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的决心，歪曲成为所谓“福摩萨—共产党中国”之间的“国际争端”，并且硬说这个争端是一个所谓“对和平的国际威胁”。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上还为他援用塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法镇压美国钢铁工人罢工的行为辩解。他承认塔夫脱—哈特莱法并没有非常光辉的历史，但是他又强辩说，他除了引用这个法律外别无其他办法。
