　　Joyful Festival, Huge Harvest
　　Zhou Weizhi
    As the people of the whole country celebrate the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, literary and art workers from many regions, ethnic groups, military units, and trade union systems have gathered in the capital with their achievements of the past ten years to hold celebratory performances for the National Day. The scale and richness of this celebratory performance are unprecedented. Since the Great Leap Forward, the flowers of literature and art in our country have become more and more luxuriant, more and more brilliant. Looking at this year's celebratory performance and thinking about the achievements in literature and art over the past ten years, who can fail to feel excited and proud! It is difficult for me to explain my deep feelings in detail in this short article. I would like to use the four words "large," "many," "good," and "new" to describe this performance.

    "Large" is not only reflected in the large scale of participation in this celebratory performance but, more importantly, in the great changes in the politics and the great leap forward in the thinking of art workers. After the rectification and anti-rightist campaigns, the broad masses of art workers further clarified the Party's literary and art policy, implemented the general line of building socialism, and demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. Many accomplished famous actors have joined the glorious Communist Party of China. Mei Lanfang, Yu Zhenfei, Chang Xiangyu, Li Shaochun, Tan Fuying, Chen Bohua, Xu Yulan, Wang Wenjuan, Zhang Meijuan, and others who participated in this celebratory performance have already become Communist Party members. Among the 6,200 people who participated in this performance, there were nearly 1,400 Communist Party members, nearly 1,900 Communist Youth League members, and many Young Pioneers. This event most clearly demonstrates the tremendous changes and great progress in the politics and thinking of our country's art workers.

    "Many" refers not only to the large number of participants and programs, but more importantly, to the wide variety of artistic styles and the broad and colorful content and themes of this celebratory performance. This is the result of truly implementing the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." In our country, any art that serves the people and socialist construction can be developed smoothly. Our political goals are consistent, but the more varieties of art, the better, and the wider the path of artistic creation, the better. Only in this way can we meet the various needs of the broad masses of the people, while also giving all kinds of artists an infinitely broad space to display their artistic creative talents.

    "Good" refers to the ideological content and artistic quality of many works in this performance. The programs in this performance have indeed achieved a relatively perfect combination of ideology and artistry. Many viewers have an opinion on this celebratory performance, saying: "Everything is good, but tickets are hard to get." This also reflects the audience's evaluation of the performance programs. Not only is the quality of professional performances good, but the performances of amateur art units have also reached a high level. In particular, the grand chorus of 230 generals was even more exciting, and many foreign guests were moved to tears.

    What is "new"? In the drama, music, and dance of this performance, modern themes and revolutionary historical themes account for a large proportion. New themes, new life, new ideas, new heroic figures, and new national styles are the characteristics of many programs in this performance. Traditional national arts, such as opera, have also been processed, reorganized, and innovated under the guidance of the Party's policy of "weed through the old to bring forth the new," showing new brilliance. Many traditional repertoires have thus regained life and deeply moved contemporary audiences.

    What is most exciting is the growth of the new generation. Young actors in many opera genres have already begun to show their outstanding artistic talents. They have grown up under the cultivation of the Party and the guidance of the older generation of artists. The creations of the older generation of artists also show new brilliance. Only new ideas, new times, and a new social system can enable these older artists to maintain their artistic youth for a long time.

    The Great Leap Forward in the arts and among art workers is the result of being promoted by the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art. Without adhering to the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, without adhering to the Party's leadership, without adhering to putting politics in command, without the Great Leap Forward in artistic work in 1958, and without the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, it would have been impossible to achieve such great results.

    Of course, we should never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Judging from the construction speed of the entire country, from the people's growing demands for culture and art, and from the peak of communist cultural development we want to reach, our achievements today are only the first step in a long march. We will encounter many difficulties on the road of creating and developing new national art of socialism. We must guard against arrogance and rashness, work hard, listen to the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, implement the mass line, and resolutely implement the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" and walking on two legs, so that we can continue to leap forward, achieve greater results, and make more contributions to the motherland and the people. Let us unite closely under the banner of the Party's general line and stride forward!

　　欢乐的节日  巨大的收获
　　周巍峙
    在全国人民欢庆我国建国十周年的伟大节日的时候，许多地区、民族和部队系统、工会系统的文艺工作者们带着十年来的成绩汇集首都，举行了国庆献礼演出。这次献礼演出规模之大，内容之丰富，是从前所没有过的。大跃进以来，我国文艺上的花朵是越开越茂盛，越开越鲜艳了。看一看今年的献礼演出，想一想十年来文艺上的成就，谁能不感到兴奋，感到自豪！我很难在这篇短文中详细说明我的深切感受，我想用“大”、“多”、“好”、“新”四个字来形容这次的演出。
    “大”，不仅表现在参加这次献礼演出的规模大，更重要的是，表现在艺术工作者政治上的大变化，思想上的大跃进。经过整风、反右以后，广大的艺术工作者们进一步明确了党的文艺方针，贯彻执行了建设社会主义的总路线，表现了冲天的干劲。许多有成就的名演员加入了光荣的中国共产党，这次参加献礼演出的梅兰芳、俞振飞、常香玉、李少春、谭富英、陈伯华、徐玉兰、王文娟、张美娟等都已经成了共产党员。参加这次演出的六千二百人当中，就有共产党员近一千四百人，共产主义青年团员近一千九百人，还有许多少先队员。这件事最显明地表现了我国艺术工作者在政治上思想上的巨大变化和巨大进步。
    “多”，不仅是指参加演出的人数多、节目多，更重要的是这次献礼演出的艺术样式繁多，节目内容题材广泛，丰富多彩。这是真正贯彻执行党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”方针的结果。在我们的国家里，只要是为人民服务、为社会主义建设服务的艺术，就都可以得到顺利发展的条件。我们的政治目的是一致的，但艺术的品种则越多越好，艺术创作的路子也越宽越好。只有这样，才能满足广大人民各方面的要求，同时又给予了各种艺术家以发挥他们的艺术创造才能的无限广阔的天地。
    “好”是指这次演出的许多作品的思想内容和艺术质量说的。这次演出的节目，的确做到了思想性和艺术性的比较完美的结合。许多观众对这次献礼演出有一个意见，他们说：“样样都好，就是票子买不到。”这也表现了观众对于这次演出节目的评价。不仅专业的演出质量好，业余艺术单位的表演也达到了较高的水平。特别是二百三十位将军的大合唱，更是激动人心，许多外宾都被感动得流下眼泪。
    什么是“新”呢？这次演出的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈中，现代题材、革命历史题材占了很大的比重。新的题材、新的生活、新的思想、新的英雄人物、新的民族风格，就是这次演出的许多节目的特点。传统的民族艺术，如戏曲等，也在党的“推陈出新”方针的指导下，经过加工、整理和革新，显示出了新的光辉。许多传统剧目就是这样地重新获得了生命，并且深深地打动了当代观众的心。
    最使人兴奋的是新的一代的成长。许多剧种的青年演员已经崭露头角，显示出他们优秀的艺术才能。他们是在党的培育和老一辈艺术家们的教导下成长起来的。老艺术家们的创造，也表现了新的光辉。只有新的思想、新的时代和新的社会制度，才能使这些老艺术家们长久保持他们的艺术的青春。
    艺术事业和艺术工作者的大跃进，是受社会主义建设大跃进推动的结果。是毛主席文艺思想的伟大胜利。不坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方针，不坚持党的领导，不坚持政治挂帅，没有1958年艺术工作上的大跃进，没有1959年的继续大跃进，要取得这样大的成绩是不可能的。
    当然，我们决不应该满足于已有的成绩。从整个国家的建设速度来看，从人民对文化艺术的日益增长的要求来看，从我们所要达到的共产主义文化发展的高峰来看，我们今天的成就还只是走了万里长征的第一步。在创造、发展社会主义的民族的新艺术的道路上还会遇到不少困难。我们必须戒骄戒躁，刻苦努力，好好听党的话，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，坚决执行党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”和两条腿走路的方针，才能继续跃进，取得更大的成绩，对祖国和人民作出更多的贡献。让我们紧紧地团结在党的总路线的旗帜下阔步前进吧！
