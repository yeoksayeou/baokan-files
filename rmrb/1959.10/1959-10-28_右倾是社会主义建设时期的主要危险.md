Right-leaning is the Main Danger During the Socialist Construction Period

The emergence and attack on the Party by right-leaning opportunist thoughts are not particularly strange occurrences, but rather completely understandable phenomena. In the 1920s, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was engaged in a serious struggle against right-leaning opportunism, Stalin pointed out: "Under the conditions of Soviet development where capitalism has been overthrown but its roots have not yet been eradicated, right-leaning in communism is a tendency or inclination for some communists to deviate from the general line of our Party and move towards bourgeois ideology." Stalin exposed the essence of right-leaning opportunism, saying: "The opportunists' usual tactic is to use the excuse of excesses in implementing the correct line to abolish this line and replace it with an opportunist line...replacing the Party's revolutionary policy with the rightists' opportunist policies." "Those who talk nonsense about the need to reduce the speed of industrial development in our country are enemies of socialism and agents of our class enemies." Reviewing the Soviet experience, looking at the path of socialist revolution and construction our country has experienced in recent years, and deeply exploring the essence of the successive struggles against right-leaning, we can easily find that the existence of the bourgeoisie and its influence is the social root of right-leaning opportunism.

Since right-leaning opportunism is a reflection of the bourgeois anti-socialist ideology within the Party, and the political thought of the bourgeoisie is based on its idealist world view, the bourgeois idealism and egoistic world view are the ideological roots of those right-leaning opportunists' fall into the anti-socialist quagmire. Facts have proved that politically right-leaning opportunists are inevitably bourgeois individualists in their thinking. It is precisely those who engage in splitting conspiracies within the Party, seek independence, create disunity, engage in small group activities, disregard organization and discipline, have weak Party spirit, are very selfish, only care about personal interests and disregard the interests of the Party, and are not wholeheartedly committed to the Party, who are bound to embark on the path of anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior in politics. Therefore, the struggle against right-leaning opportunism, in the final analysis, is the struggle to uphold the proletarian revolutionary world view and oppose the bourgeois reactionary world view. Right-leaning opportunism wants to transform our Party and the world according to the bourgeois world view. Therefore, defending the unity of the Party, defending the Party's general line, and defending the Party's Marxist world view are completely inseparable. Resolutely overcoming bourgeois individualism and arming our cadres with a dialectical materialist world view is the ideological guarantee for overcoming right-leaning opportunism and implementing the Party's general line.

Marxism has two well-known sayings: one is "Educators must first be educated," and the other is "To keep others from wavering, one must first be unwavering oneself." Applying these two sentences to the struggle against right-leaning is also entirely appropriate. In order to thoroughly carry out the struggle against right-leaning, first of all, every Party member, especially leading cadres at all levels, must have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of this struggle, resolutely oppose the right-leaning emotions against "anti-right-leaning," have clear thinking, clear boundaries, and a firm stand. Some people with right-leaning thoughts, when they hear about launching an anti-right-leaning movement, either emphasize that their work is busy and they don't have time for the movement, or they think that their units "have nothing to counter on the right, or not much," and that "there is no point in fighting right-leaning"; when the movement gradually deepens, they think: "The right-leaning has been countered, it's almost over," "Just need to boost the energy." In fact, the problem is certainly not that right-leaning does not exist in their area, but precisely because they themselves have right-leaning thoughts, they have lost their keen sense of political awareness. The so-called lack of right-leaning is precisely a counter-evidence that the leadership has right-leaning. There are also some people who adopt a vulgar conciliatory attitude towards right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning opportunism, blurring the struggle of principles, and do not resolutely expose, criticize, and overcome it, which is itself a manifestation of right-leaning.

The main method of opposing right-leaning and right-leaning opportunism is to carry out ideological struggle, that is, we should focus on education and improvement, and follow the principle of "unity – criticism – unity." Because for most people, right-leaning is mainly due to vague understanding or a lack of firm stance; right-leaning opportunists and anti-Party and anti-socialist people are only a very small minority; right-leaning opportunists also have two sides, and their contradictions with us are generally contradictions among the people. As long as they are determined to expose and correct their mistakes, we should still welcome them. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre should consciously and actively participate in the anti-right-leaning rectification movement, so that they can receive a profound education on the Party's general line and a proletarian world view in the movement, pass the socialist test well, and be determined to be a thorough and genuine Marxist-Leninist.

### 右倾是社会主义建设时期的主要危险

    右倾是社会主义建设时期的主要危险
    右倾机会主义思潮的出现和向党进攻，并不是什么特别奇怪的事情，这是完全可以理解的现象。在二十年代，苏联共产党同右倾机会主义进行严重斗争的时候，斯大林指出：“在资本主义已经被推翻，但是资本主义根柢还没有挖除的苏维埃发展条件下，共产主义中的右倾就是一部分共产党员离开我们党的总路线而走向资产阶级思想方面去的趋向或倾向”。斯大林揭露右倾机会主义的实质说：“机会主义者惯用的手段就是：借口在实行正确的路线中有过火行为，就来取消这条路线，用机会主义的路线来代替它。……用右倾分子的机会主义政策来代替党的革命政策。”“那些胡说必须减低我国工业发展速度的人，是社会主义的敌人，是我们阶级敌人的代理人。”重温一下苏联的经验，看看我国近年来社会主义革命和建设所经历的途程，深入探索历次反右倾斗争的本质，我们不难发现：资产阶级及其影响的存在，这是右倾机会主义产生的社会根源。
    右倾机会主义既然是资产阶级反社会主义思潮在党内的反映，资产阶级的政治思想是建立在它的唯心主义世界观的基础之上的，因此，资产阶级的唯心主义和唯我主义的世界观，也就是那些右倾机会主义分子堕入反社会主义泥坑的思想根源。事实证明，政治上的右倾机会主义者，思想上必然是资产阶级个人主义者。正是那些在党内闹分裂阴谋，闹独立性，闹不团结，搞小组织活动，目无组织和纪律，党性薄弱，私心很重，只顾个人利益，不顾党的利益，对党不一条心的人，发展下去必然要走上政治上反党反社会主义的道路。因此，反对右倾机会主义的斗争，归根到底，也就是坚持无产阶级的革命世界观，反对资产阶级的反动世界观的斗争。右倾机会主义要按照资产阶级的世界观改造我们党，改造世界。因此，保卫党的团结，保卫党的总路线，同保卫党的马克思主义世界观是完全分不开的。坚决克服资产阶级个人主义，用辩证唯物主义世界观武装我们干部，是克服右倾机会主义，贯彻执行党的总路线的思想保证。
    马克思主义有两句大家熟知的名言，一句是“教育者必须首先受教育”，一句是“要别人不动摇，首先要自己不动摇”。把这两句话用在反右倾斗争上，也是完全适宜的。为要把反右倾的斗争进行彻底，首先，每个党员特别是各级领导干部对这场斗争的严重意义必须要有足够的认识，要坚决反掉对“反右倾”的右倾情绪，思想要明确，界限要分明，立场要坚定。一些有右倾思想的人，当一提到要开展反右倾运动时，他们不是强调业务工作忙，没有时间搞运动，就是认为他们的单位“无右可反，有也不多”，“反右倾没有什么搞头”；当运动逐步深入的时候，却又认为：“右倾已经反过了，差不多了”，“只要把干劲鼓起来就行了”。事实上，问题当然不是他们那里不存在右倾，而恰恰是由于他们本身存在右倾思想，因此在政治上就失去了敏锐的嗅觉。所谓没有右倾正是领导存在右倾的反证。也有一些人，对于右倾思想，对于右倾机会主义，采取庸俗的调和态度，模糊原则的斗争，不坚决去揭露它，批判它，克服它，这本身也是一种右倾的表现。
    反对右倾、反对右倾机会主义，主要的方法是开展思想的斗争，也就是说，应当着重教育提高，遵循“团结——批评——团结”的原则。因为对于大多数的人说来，产生右倾主要地还是由于认识模糊或者立场不够坚定，右倾机会主义分子和反党反社会主义的人，终归只是极少数；右倾机会主义分子，也还存在两面性，他们同我们的矛盾，一般地说，还是人民内部的矛盾，只要他们决心揭露和改正错误，我们还是应当欢迎的。每个共产党员和革命干部，都应当自觉地、积极地参加到反右倾的整风运动中去，使自己在运动中受到一次深刻的党的总路线的教育和无产阶级世界观的教育，过好社会主义这一关，决心做一个彻底的名副其实的马克思列宁主义者。
