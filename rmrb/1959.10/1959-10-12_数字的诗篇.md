　　The Poetry of Numbers
　　Hong Chun
    Numbers can only express abstract concepts, but poetry can express ardent and profound emotions, so numbers are different from poetry.

    However, poetry cannot do without numbers.

    Shanghai workers have a Great Leap Forward song: "Ten years since the founding of the country, many happy events, the motherland sings the Great Leap Forward song; taking five steps as two, ten years of flying to catch up with England." The "five," "two," and "ten" in this poem themselves express extremely ardent and profound emotions. The numbers in this poem express the working class's labor enthusiasm, soaring spirit, high morale, and heroic spirit...

    The numbers in the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are even more dazzling and beautiful. In the first half of this year, China's total industrial output value increased by 65% compared with the same period last year, and the total output of summer crops was even more than last year's exceptionally bumper harvest; the verified figures for the completion of the national economic plan last year were: 8 million tons of "foreign steel," 270 million tons of coal, and 500 billion jin of grain... These numbers themselves are a magnificent and majestic poem, a remarkable ode recording the earth-shaking miracles created by 650 million hard-working and brave people holding high the glorious banner of the General Line.

    It is these numerical poems that inspire us to continue to move forward with giant strides on the basis of last year's great victory!

    Recently, China's 650 million people have been working vigorously in the fourth quarter, continuing to write numerical poems with their will and sweat. Under our loud and clear chanting of poems that resounds throughout the world, let the reactionaries at home and abroad chirp and wail like autumn insects!

　　数字的诗篇
　　洪纯
    数字只能表现抽象的概念，诗却能表现热烈而深邃的感情，所以说，数字不同于诗。
    然而，诗里面却少不了数字。
    上海工人有一首跃进歌：“建国十年喜事多，祖国高唱跃进歌；五步并作两步走，十年飞步赶英国”这首诗中的“五”“两”“十”本身，就是感情极其热烈而深邃的。这首诗里的数字，表现了工人阶级的劳动热情、干劲冲天、斗志昂扬、气概豪迈……。
    党的八届八中全会公报中的数字，更是琳琅满目，美不胜收。今年上半年我国工业总产值比去年同期增长了65％，农业夏季作物总产量比去年特大丰收还要多；去年国民经济计划完成的核实数字为：“洋钢”八百万吨，煤二亿七千万吨，粮食五千亿斤……，这些数字本身，就是一首瑰丽雄伟的诗，它是记录六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的人民高举总路线的光荣旗帜创造惊天动地的奇迹的杰出颂诗。
    正是这些数字的诗篇，鼓舞我们在去年伟大胜利的基础上，继续迈着巨人的步伐奋然前行！
    最近，我国六亿五千万人民，正在轰轰烈烈地大干第四季度，用意志和汗水继续不断地写着数字的诗篇，在我们这响彻全球的琅琅的吟诗声下，让国内外反动派像秋虫一般振翅哀鸣吧！
