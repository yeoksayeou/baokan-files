Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Peng Shihua, the representative of the advanced collective - the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's First Iron and Steel Plant, attending the National "Conference of Heroes," used inspiring facts in his speech today to eloquently illustrate that without ideological revolution, there would be no leap forward in production. It is necessary to thoroughly oppose Rightism and muster full effort to enable the socialist construction cause to continuously achieve new victories.

Peng Shihua's plant has two old-fashioned medium-sized blast furnaces built over forty years ago. After liberation, the plant's production level increased year by year. The output of pig iron in the first nine months of this year exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by more than double, the quality all reached the national standards, and the cost also overfulfilled the plans for each period. These two furnaces, once called "old and toothless," have continuously maintained the leading position in the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide for eighteen consecutive months.

In the past year or so, they have conducted five struggles against Right-leaning conservatism on the ideological front. In the spring of 1958, when the workers proposed the operational policy of simultaneously increasing blast furnace production, improving smelting intensity, and reducing the coke ratio, some technical cadres believed that these two old furnaces "had no potential to tap," saying that such a method had never been seen in any ironmaking history. In response to these Right-leaning conservative ideas, the Party committee fully mobilized the masses, launched in-depth mass airing of views and debates, studied advanced experiences from other places, and criticized dogmatism and empiricism; at the same time, it organized the main leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, together with workers and technicians, to boldly conduct experiments on the No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace for more than twenty days, which increased the smelting intensity and reduced the coke ratio. As a result, the daily output increased by 18%.

As the output of pig iron continued to increase, imbalances appeared in the plant, such as equipment and raw materials. Some cadres believed that "production had reached its peak" and could not be increased any further. Under such circumstances, the Party committee, according to the spirit of the General Line, timely put forward the fighting slogan of "establishing lofty aspirations, accomplishing great things, and completing the five-year plan (coefficient of 1.667) in one year" in terms of technical indicators, and mobilized the masses to launch a red banner emulation drive, which quickly improved raw material conditions, broke through a series of weak links such as equipment lagging behind, overcame difficulties, and further improved the blast furnace coefficient.

After the Beidaihe Conference, the situation of the Great Leap Forward required a continued large increase in the output of pig iron. The broad masses of workers were full of enthusiasm, but a few cadres pessimistically believed that the Great Leap Forward was "reckless" and would "mess up" enterprise production. In response to the above situation, the Party committee, while resolutely opposing Right-leaning conservative ideas, mustering full effort, vigorously carrying out technological revolution, and focusing on measures, launched a comprehensive red banner emulation movement inside and outside the plant, giving full play to the role of youth teams in tackling key problems, quickly reversing the production situation and increasing the blast furnace utilization coefficient from 1.936 in August to 2.077.

The fourth struggle against Right-leaning conservative ideas was launched in early January of this year. At that time, the Central Committee put forward the instruction of "combining hard work with rest and recuperation" and "combining labor and leisure." Right-leaning conservative ideas took the opportunity to raise their heads again, spreading a slack mood of "rest means vacation." Through in-depth study of the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory launched a mass debate, summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, affirmed the achievements, examined and criticized Right-leaning slack emotions, correctly implemented the instruction of combining hard work with rest and recuperation, and the enthusiasm of the masses continued to rise, successively launching mass production movements such as the "opening red during the Spring Festival" and the "steel grabbing battle" high-yield week and high-yield ten days, making production flourish.

In June and July of this year, during the implementation of "plan implementation" in the steel plant, a few cadres again had a more serious Right-leaning sentiment, believing that "the lower the plan, the better." This Right-leaning sentiment once caused ideological confusion among the masses, so that the production level in June and July not only did not increase but decreased compared with May. In early August, the Party Central Committee issued the correct instruction of "opposing Rightism and mustering effort" and the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. The factory Party committee immediately launched a struggle of "opposing while mustering" with opposing Rightism as the key link among the masses. Cadres at all levels seriously conducted self-criticism and further changed their style, delving into reality, which led the masses to set off a new upsurge of the vigorous increase production and practice economy movement, making production in August rise rapidly, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient increased from 2.350 in July to 2.419; in September, it further increased to 2.577, and created the miracle of breaking through the 3.0 mark, achieving the victory of the fifth struggle against Rightism.

Peng Shihua pointed out in his speech: These five processes of opposing Rightism are also processes of continuous technological innovation and continuous leap forward in production. The practice of struggle in the past year fully proves a truth: whenever the Party's General Line is firmly implemented and the opposition to Rightism and the encouragement of effort are firmly grasped, the mass movement will be vigorous and the production indicators will be on the rise; otherwise, it will be deserted and production will decline.

    反右倾　立大志　一年走完五年路程
    彭石华在群英会报告本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的伟大成就
    据新华社27日讯　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体——本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的代表彭石华，今天在大会上用振奋人心的事实，雄辩地说明了：没有思想上的革命，就没有生产上的跃进，必须反透右倾、鼓足干劲，才能使社会主义建设事业不断获得新的胜利。
    彭石华所在的这个厂，有两座四十多年前建立的旧式中型高炉。解放后这个厂的生产水平逐年提高，今年头九个月的生铁产量就超过解放前最高年产量的一倍以上，质量全部达到国家规定的标准，成本也超额地完成了各个时期的计划。这两座过去被人们称为“老掉了牙齿的炉子”，已经连续十八个月保持了全国大中型高炉利用系数的领先地位。
    一年多以来，他们在思想战线上，曾经进行了五次反对右倾保守的斗争。1958年春天，当职工们提出高炉增产、提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针时，部分技术干部认为这两座老炉子“没有什么潜力可挖”，说什么在任何炼铁史上也没有见过这种作法。党委针对这些右倾保守思想，充分发动群众，开展了群众性的深入的鸣放辩论，学习外地的先进经验，批判了教条主义和经验主义；同时组织党政工团主要领导干部同工人、技术人员一起，在一号青年高炉上大胆地进行了二十多天的试验，提高了冶炼强度，同时降低了焦比，结果日产量提高了18％。
    由于生铁产量不断提高，厂内出现了设备与原料等不平衡现象，部分干部就认为“生产已经到顶”，不能再提高了。在这种情况下，党委根据总路线的精神，及时在技术指标方面提出“立大志、办大事，五年计划（系数一点六六七）一年完成”的战斗口号，发动群众掀起红旗竞赛热潮，迅速地改善了原料条件，突破了设备跟不上等一系列的薄弱环节，战胜了困难，进一步提高了高炉系数。
    北戴河会议后，大跃进的形势要求生铁产量必须继续大量提高，广大职工干劲冲天，但少数干部却消极地认为大跃进是“蛮干”，会把企业生产搞“乱”；党委针对上述情况，在狠狠地反对右倾保守思想、鼓足干劲，大闹技术革命、大抓措施的同时，展开了厂内外全面大协作的红旗竞赛运动，充分发挥了青年班组大攻关键的突击作用，很快地扭转了生产局面，使高炉利用系数从8月份的一点九三六，一跃而为二点○七七。
    第四次同右倾保守思想的斗争，是在今年1月初展开的。当时中央提出了“苦战与休整相结合”，“劳与逸相结合”的指示，右倾保守思想又乘机抬头，散布“休整就是休息”的松劲情绪。工厂通过对党的八届六中全会文件的深入学习，开展群众性的大辩论，总结了去年大跃进的经验，肯定了成绩，检查批判了右倾松劲情绪，正确地贯彻执行了苦战与休整相结合的指示，群众热情不断高涨，又先后掀起了春节期间开门红和“夺钢大战”高产周、高产旬等群众生产运动，使生产蒸蒸日上。
  今年6、7月间钢铁厂在贯彻“计划落实”过程中，少数干部又发生了一次较严重的右倾情绪，认为“计划越低越好”。这种右倾情绪，在群众中曾一度造成思想混乱，使6、7月的生产水平不但没有提高反而比5月下降。8月初党中央发出了“反右倾、鼓干劲”的正确指示和八届八中全会的决议，工厂党委立即在群众中展开了以反右倾为纲的“边反边鼓”的斗争。各级干部认真地进行了自我检查，并且进一步转变作风，深入了实际，这样就带动群众掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的新高潮，使8月份生产迅速上升，高炉利用系数由7月份的二点三五○提高到二点四一九；9月份更提高到二点五七七，并创造了突破三点○大关的奇迹，取得了第五次反右倾斗争的胜利。
    彭石华在发言中指出：这五次反右倾的过程，也就是技术不断革新、生产不断跃进的过程。一年来的斗争实践，充分证明了一个真理：什么时候坚定地贯彻了党的总路线，抓紧了反右倾、鼓干劲，什么时候群众运动就轰轰烈烈，生产指标就蒸蒸日上；反之，就会冷冷清清，生产低落。
