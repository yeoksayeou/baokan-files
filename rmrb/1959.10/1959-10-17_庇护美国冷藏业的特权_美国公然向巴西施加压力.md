　　Privileges Protecting the American Refrigeration Industry
    The United States Publicly Exerts Pressure on Brazil
    Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro: The United States government is putting pressure on Brazil, attempting to prevent the Brazilian government from interfering with American refrigeration companies. These American refrigeration companies monopolize Brazil's meat production and resist government decrees regarding meat price increases.
    On the 13th, important figures in the Brazilian government revealed to the "Brazilian Daily" that Brazilian Ambassador to the United States, Sales, reported to the Brazilian government last weekend that the U.S. State Department had once again requested that the Brazilian government not interfere with American private capital enterprises. The newspaper said that the ambassador’s report to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated that the U.S. State Department believes that "North American public opinion will be displeased and surprised by any interference by the Brazilian government in American private capital enterprises." According to the "Ultima Hora" on the same day, the Brazilian government is studying two measures to make intervention in the refrigeration industry effective: one, to stop the export of beef products; and two, to immediately require domestic and foreign refrigeration companies to repay debts to the "Bank of Brazil" and the Brazilian "National Economic Development Bank."
    The Food Supply and Price Commission announced that, given the problematic meat supply for residents of Rio de Janeiro, it is now more necessary than ever to implement Brazilian government intervention in foreign refrigeration companies.

　　庇护美国冷藏业的特权
    美国公然向巴西施加压力
    据新华社讯里约热内卢消息：美国政府正在向巴西施加压力，企图阻止巴西政府对美国的冷藏业进行干预。这些美国冷藏业垄断了巴西的肉类生产并且抗拒政府关于肉类涨价的法令。
    巴西政府重要人士13日向“巴西日报”透露说，巴西驻美大使萨莱斯上周末向巴西政府汇报了美国国务院再次提出的要巴西政府不干涉美国冷藏业的要求。报纸说，这位大使向巴西外交部提出的报告说，美国国务院认为，“北美舆论将对巴西政府对美国私人资本企业的任何干预感到不快和惊异。”据同一天的“最后一点钟报”透露，巴西政府正在研究两种措施，以使对冷藏业的干预见效：一，制止牛肉制品出口；二、立即要本国和外国冷藏业向“巴西银行”和巴西“国家经济开发银行”偿还债务。
    粮食供应和物价委员会宣布，鉴于里约热内卢居民的肉类供应成问题，现在比任何时候更有必要使巴西政府对外国冷藏业的干预付诸实施。
