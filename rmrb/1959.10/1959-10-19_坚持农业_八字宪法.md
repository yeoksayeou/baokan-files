　　Adhere to the "Eight-Character Constitution" for Agriculture
    During the First Five-Year Plan, China's grain output increased by 19.8%, an average annual increase of 3.7%; cotton output increased by 25.8%, an average annual increase of 4.7%. In 1958, the situation changed dramatically, with grain output increasing by 35% in one year, and cotton output increasing by 28% in one year. In 1959, despite the severe natural disasters, grain and cotton production can still be increased by about 10% compared to 1958. This is the result of continuous revolution in the relations of production, and also the result of continuous revolution in production technology. The great leap forward in agriculture and the people's communes, along with the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, appeared together in 1958, which is by no means a coincidence.
    From the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956, a high tide of agricultural cooperation was launched in China's rural areas; at the same time, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experiences of the masses and the results of scientific research, and drafted forty articles for the agricultural development outline, which proposed twelve measures for increasing agricultural production. The great goals and clear measures greatly encouraged and guided hundreds of millions of commune members. In 1956, China suffered relatively serious natural disasters, but grain output still increased by more than 15 billion catties compared to the better year of 1955; the output of grain and cotton in some provinces increased by more than 10%; many counties saw a great leap forward, with grain and cotton output increasing by tens of percent in one year. In 1957, the agricultural development outline was doubted by some people, who poured cold water on the masses in some areas, and agricultural production suffered some losses. However, in areas that adhered to the agricultural development outline, agricultural production continued to make great progress that year, and a large number of advanced units with high yields emerged. In October 1957, the Party Central Committee re-published the revised and supplemented draft of the agricultural development outline. In addition, the enthusiasm of the masses for socialist construction was unprecedentedly high after the nationwide rectification campaign. From the winter of 1957, a large-scale production and construction upsurge was launched. In May 1958, at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the agricultural development outline was revised and supplemented once again based on the development of the situation and new experiences. Later, with the development of the nationwide great leap forward, agricultural production cooperatives, under the leadership of the Party, developed into people's communes that were more conducive to the all-round great leap forward of the rural economy; at the same time, the measures to increase production in the forty articles of the agricultural development outline were further refined by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the experience of mass practice and the results of scientific research, and developed into the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, which is soil (deep plowing, soil improvement, soil survey and land planning), fertilizer (rational fertilization), water (developing water conservancy and rational water use), seed (popularizing good seeds), density (rational close planting), protection (plant protection, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests), management (field management), and tools (tool reform). In their long-term production practice, Chinese farmers have accumulated a lot of experience in one or another of the above measures; agricultural scientific workers have also done a lot of research; however, a few years ago, these practices and researches were mostly unsystematic. From the twelve measures for increasing production in the agricultural development outline to the further refinement into the "Eight-Character Constitution," people have more clearly recognized the interrelationship and comprehensive role of various measures for increasing production, and pointed out the direction for the high-speed development of agricultural production and the further improvement of agricultural science.
    Calling the eight important measures for increasing agricultural production the "Eight-Character Constitution" means that these eight measures are the fundamental plan for increasing agricultural production. If the "Eight-Character Constitution" is cancelled, it is equivalent to cancelling the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, and it is equivalent to cancelling the general line of socialist construction. When summarizing the experience of this year's summer harvest, the broad masses of farmers said: "The good harvest is due to the good leadership of the Communist Party, the great strength of the people's communes, and the flowering of the Eight-Character Constitution." This is the fair evaluation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" by the broad masses of farmers. However, some people who are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes have also attacked and doubted the "Eight-Character Constitution." Some of them are right-leaning opportunists, and some of them have right-leaning conservative ideas. Just as the emergence of the "Eight-Character Constitution" is not an accidental phenomenon, the attack on the "Eight-Character Constitution" is by no means accidental. Right-leaning opportunists see that the general line cannot be shaken, so they want to dig the foundation of the general line from the side. They know that if the fundamental law of agricultural production increase is dug away, there will naturally be no great leap forward in agriculture, and the general line will not be able to stand firmly. Of course, it is inappropriate to overestimate the role of right-leaning opportunists. They do not have the power to pull the broad masses of farmers back from the road of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes. However, their destructive and corrosive effects cannot be underestimated. If they are allowed to do as they please, if the faces of the right-leaning opportunists are not exposed in time, and if their fallacies are not refuted, then our socialist cause will be corroded. The emergence and development of new things always involve multiple struggles with stubborn habitual forces; and those with right-leaning conservative ideas always use the old habitual forces to fight against new things. Naturally, we cannot equate conservative ideas influenced by habitual forces with right-leaning opportunism. However, we must expose and refute the right-leaning opportunists, thereby isolating them and shrinking their market smaller and smaller, so that they cannot use habitual forces to hinder the development of new things. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly expose and refute the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists attacking the "Eight-Character Constitution" among the masses.
    Is the "Eight-Character Constitution" good or not? Is it scientific or not? It is very good, very scientific! Practice is the criterion of truth. All the facts of last year and this year have proved that wherever the "Eight-Character Constitution" is earnestly and practically implemented, agricultural production develops quickly and greater harvests are obtained. Not to mention the distant past, just taking a few well-known facts in this year's agricultural production can show the great achievements of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" and the absurdity of the arguments of the right-leaning opportunists.
    Attacks on the "Eight-Character Constitution" are mostly concentrated on the four measures of "soil," "water," "density," and "fertilizer." Because the beginning of the great leap forward in agricultural production was the earth-shattering mass movement of large-scale water conservancy construction and the mass movement of deep plowing. Therefore, right-leaning opportunists shouted and screamed, regarding the "water" and "soil" measures in the "Eight-Character Constitution" as the "root of disaster" and launching vicious attacks. The absurd arguments in this regard have already been refuted in the editorial "Large-Scale Water Conservancy Construction is Very Good" in this newspaper on September 7 and the editorial "Adhere to Deep Plowing" on October 13, so I will not say more here. The reason why right-leaning opportunists attacked the "density" character is because the "density" character is the center of the "Eight-Character Constitution"; many measures are implemented around the "density" character. The yield of crops is directly related to the number of effective plants per unit area. Close planting is to ensure that there are the most effective plants per unit area. People who attack the "density" character say that close planting has caused a reduction in production, and blame the reduction in production caused by insufficient effort in individual places or the reduction in production caused by improper measures on the "density" character in the "Eight-Character Constitution." In fact, the meaning of the "density" character in the "Eight-Character Constitution" is originally rational close planting, which refers to the past habit of sparse planting, and it does not mean that regardless of conditions, without limit, the denser the better, which is common sense.
　　Right-leaning opportunists confuse the public, confuse the examples of planting too densely in small-area experiments in individual places with rational close planting, regardless of the facts, and fundamentally oppose close planting. Helplessly, the facts always refuse to help right-leaning opportunists. The large number of facts of high yield last year and this year have proved that the increase in crop yield is closely related to rational close planting. In the past, the number of effective wheat plants per mu was generally about 100,000 to 200,000; this year, many wheat fields in the south have increased to 200,000 to 400,000 plants per mu, and many wheat fields in the north have increased to 200,000 to 600,000 plants per mu; the yield has increased in the vast majority of cases. Within a certain density range, the higher the number of plants, the higher the yield. According to a survey and statistics in Jiangsu Province, the yield per mu is 200 to 300 catties with 200,000 to 300,000 ears per mu; the yield per mu is 300 to 400 catties with 250,000 to 350,000 ears per mu; the yield per mu is 400 to 500 catties with 300,000 to 360,000 ears per mu. According to a survey and statistics in Hebei Province, for every 100,000 additional effective plants per mu within 500,000 plants per mu, the yield increases by about 100 catties. Of course, the yield-increasing effect of increasing the number of plants has a certain limit and must be closely coordinated with various conditions. It is not surprising that individual plots have not achieved yield increases because the density exceeds the rational limit or other measures have not been well coordinated. This is unavoidable in the process of experimentation and exploration. Grasping such examples, attacking one point without considering the rest, denying the value of rational close planting, and even denying the entire "Eight-Character Constitution," is a unique way of thinking for right-leaning opportunists. As for the broad masses of working farmers, they do not think this way. During this year's spring sowing, summer sowing, and autumn sowing, many communes and production teams discussed the issue of close planting. Most commune members, through the analysis of a large number of facts, recognized the important role of rational close planting in increasing production; for individual cases where close planting was inappropriate and reduced production, they specifically analyzed the reasons and found ways to improve. Facts have proved that the peasant masses are in favor of rational close planting, and they only disapprove of individual cases of excessive close planting. People with right-leaning opportunist ideas are very different. They use opposition to close planting as a name to actually oppose rational close planting, oppose the "Eight-Character Constitution," and oppose the general line.
    The "fertilizer" character has also been attacked. Some people say that "large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation campaigns waste labor"; or that "large-scale local chemical fertilizer production has messed things up"; or that "lodging and reduced production are all because of too much fertilizer." Is large-scale fertilizer accumulation "not worth the effort"? The facts of large-scale production increases have powerfully refuted this fallacy. What should be particularly pointed out is that in this spring's large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign, there have been great improvements in labor organization and tool reform, and the quality of fertilizers has also been improved. Many places have also promoted methods such as fertilizer accumulation in the fields and livestock pens on the mountains. Compared with the past, it takes much less labor to accumulate the same quantity and quality of fertilizer. Peasants initially made local chemical fertilizers, and they did take some detours due to lack of experience; however, this is only a temporary phenomenon. In the mass movement of making local chemical fertilizers, the local chemical fertilizer resources of many regions have been quickly identified, and the masses' knowledge and skills in identifying local chemical fertilizer raw materials and making local chemical fertilizers have also been rapidly improved. Improper fertilization can indeed cause lodging; however, the "fertilizer" character in the "Eight-Character Constitution" originally includes the meaning of rational fertilization. It certainly does not mean that regardless of what kind of fertilizer, what kind of soil, or what kind of crops, the more fertilizer the better. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on fertilizer issues on August 29 last year clearly stipulated: "It is necessary to 'apply fertilizer according to the soil,' and apply different fertilizers according to different soils, and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. should be appropriately matched"; "Not only should more fertilizer be applied, but also the fertilizer efficiency should be improved as much as possible from the fertilization method." It is very easy for anyone to find some shortcomings in fertilizer accumulation and application in more than 20,000 communes and hundreds of thousands of production teams; however, it is impossible to use this to attack the "Eight-Character Constitution."
    In addition to the above-mentioned right-leaning opportunist fallacies on the fertilizer issue, there are also some conservative ideas. For example, every year during the large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign, some people always say "there is no fertilizer to accumulate." This is a pessimistic old tune. However, under the leadership of the Party, the masses always answer them with the fact of accumulating a large amount of fertilizer. In 1956, the national farmland fertilization level was unprecedentedly improved, with an average of about 25 dans of fertilizer applied per mu; in 1957, it was still about 25 dans. At the beginning of 1958, some people said, "there is no fertilizer to accumulate"; however, as a result of the large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation campaign, more than 300 billion dans of fertilizer were accumulated, and a large amount of local chemical fertilizer was also produced, with an average of 100 to 200 dans of fertilizer applied per mu. There are many places where hundreds of dans of fertilizer are applied per mu. At the beginning of 1959, some people said again, "there is no fertilizer to accumulate"; however, as a result, the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated in the spring exceeded the same period in 1958.
    In the "seed," "protection," "management," and "tools" aspects, there are also some chattering arguments: either attacking the popularization of good seeds with examples of individual popularization of good seeds violating the principle of adapting to local conditions; or opposing the large-scale use of local pesticides, believing that without "foreign" pesticides, there is no way to deal with diseases and insect pests; or believing that "gardenization" is "formalism"; or regarding the inevitable repeated experiments in the process of tool reform as "wasteful of manpower and money," believing that tool reform cannot rely on mass movements; and so on. Some of these are dogmatic generalizations of individual cases, not paying attention to or deliberately not talking about the large number of facts of production increase due to the popularization of good seeds and other measures; some do not recognize or believe in the power of the masses, or treat the new things created by the masses with the frivolous skeptical attitude of bourgeois intellectuals. The "Eight-Character Constitution" is an inseparable whole, and any damage to any of them will prevent the other items from fully playing their role and hinder the great leap forward in agriculture. In order to further unleash the enthusiasm of the masses and for the continued great leap forward in agriculture, it is necessary to resolutely criticize the statements and actions that attack the "Eight-Character Constitution" from all aspects.
    The struggle surrounding the "Eight-Character Constitution" is related to whether to build socialism with full enthusiasm, striving for the top, more, faster, better, and more economical, or to be discouraged, slack, content with the bottom, less, slower, worse, and more expensive. This is a struggle related to adhering to the general line and opposing the general line in agricultural production. Of course, this does not mean that everyone who doubts new technologies is a right-leaning opportunist; however, it must be noted that people with conservative ideas are most likely to become prisoners of right-leaning opportunism without realizing it. Any old-fashioned, clinging to the old and unwilling to let go thoughts and attitudes are wrong; only thoughts and attitudes with full enthusiasm, mastering scientific laws, painstakingly studying, and boldly innovating are correct.
    This year, the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" has more clearly demonstrated its power. It has helped the people's communes overcome serious natural disasters and obtained bumper harvests in both summer and autumn. Each people's commune has more and better experience in how to specifically implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" in different regions, different seasons, and different crops. At present, it is the best time to summarize this year's experience in implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" and apply these experiences to strive for a greater harvest next year. All localities and all people's communes must, under the guidance of the general laws of the "Eight-Character Constitution," further seek the special laws for implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" in different regions and different crops, formulate specific measures for continued great leap forward, and fully use the powerful forces of the people's communes to realize these measures, and bravely advance to strive for a continued great leap forward in agricultural production next year.

### 坚持农业“八字宪法”

专栏：社论

　　坚持农业“八字宪法”
    第一个五年计划期间，我国的粮食产量提高了19.8％，平均每年递增3.7％；棉花产量提高了25.8％，平均每年递增4.7％。1958年，情况发生了极大的变化，粮食产量一年增长了35％，棉花产量一年增长了28％。1959年，虽然遭受了特大的自然灾害，粮食和棉花的产量仍然可以比1958年再提高10％左右。这是生产关系方面不断革命的结果，也是生产技术方面不断革命的结果。农业的特大跃进和人民公社、农业“八字宪法”一齐出现在1958年，这决不是偶然的现象。
    1955年下半年到1956年上半年，在我国农村中掀起了农业合作化高潮；同时，党中央和毛泽东同志总结了群众的经验和科学研究的成果，拟定了农业发展纲要四十条，其中提出了农业增产的十二项措施。伟大的目标和明确的措施对几亿社员群众起了极大的鼓舞和指导作用。1956年，遭受了相当严重的自然灾害，而粮食产量仍然比年成较好的1955年增加了一百五十多亿斤；有些省的粮、棉产量增加了10％以上；许多县出现了大跃进的局面，粮、棉产量一年间提高百分之几十。1957年，农业发展纲要受到某些人的怀疑，他们在一些地方给群众泼冷水，农业生产受了一些损失。可是，凡是坚持农业发展纲要的地区，这一年的农业生产就继续获得了很大的进展，出现了一大批高额丰产的先进单位。1957年10月，党中央重新公布了经过修改补充的农业发展纲要草案，加以经过全民整风以后群众的社会主义建设积极性空前高涨，从1957年冬季就开始掀起了一个规模空前的生产建设高潮。1958年5月，在党的八届代表大会二次会议上，根据形势的发展和新的经验，对农业发展纲要又作了一次修订补充。以后，随着全国大跃进的形势的发展，农业生产合作社在党的领导下，发展成为更便利于农村经济全面大跃进的人民公社；同时，农业发展纲要四十条中的增产措施也由毛泽东同志根据群众实践的经验和科学研究的成果，经过进一步的提炼，发展成为农业“八字宪法”，这就是土（深耕、改良土壤、土壤普查和土地规划）、肥（合理施肥）、水（发展水利和合理用水）、种（推广良种）、密（合理密植）、保（植物保护，防治病虫害）、管（田间管理）、工（工具改革）。我国农民在长期的生产实践中，对以上各项措施的这一项或者那一项，都积累了不少经验；农业科学工作人员也曾作过不少研究；但是，在几年以前，这些实践和研究大都是不成系统的。从农业发展纲要的十二项增产措施，到进一步提炼为“八字宪法”，才使人们更清楚地认清了各项增产措施的相互关系和综合作用，为农业生产的高速度发展和农业科学的进一步提高指出了方向。
    把农业增产的八项重要措施叫做“八字宪法”，就是说这八项措施是农业增产的根本大计。如果取消“八字宪法”，就等于取消农业生产的继续大跃进，等于取消社会主义建设的总路线。广大农民群众在总结今年夏季丰收的经验时说：“丰产是共产党领导的好，是人民公社力量大，是八字宪法开了花。”这就是广大农民对“八字宪法”的公正的评价。但是，一些对总路线、大跃进和人民公社心怀不满或者有所怀疑的人，对“八字宪法”也攻击起来、怀疑起来。他们中有些是右倾机会主义分子，有些是有右倾保守思想的人。正同“八字宪法”的产生不是偶然的现象一样，对“八字宪法”的攻击也决不是偶然的。右倾机会主义者看到总路线无法动摇，就想从一个侧面来挖总路线的墙脚。他们知道，如果把农业增产的根本大法挖掉了，自然就不会有农业大跃进了，总路线也就站不牢稳了。当然，过高地估计右倾机会主义分子的作用是不恰当的，他们没有力量把广大农民从总路线、大跃进和人民公社的道路上拉回去。但是，也不能低估他们的破坏和腐蚀作用。如果听之任之，如果不及时地把右倾机会主义分子的面目揭穿，不把它们的谬论击破，那就会腐蚀我们的社会主义事业。新事物的产生和发展，总是要同顽固的习惯势力进行多次的斗争；而有右倾保守思想的人又总是要利用旧有的习惯势力来同新事物作斗争。我们自然不能把受习惯势力影响的保守思想和右倾机会主义当成一回事。但是，我们必须把右倾机会主义分子加以揭露、驳斥，从而把他们孤立起来，把他们的市场缩得小而又小，使他们没法利用习惯势力来阻挠新事物的发展。因此，必须在群众中间把右倾机会主义分子攻击“八字宪法”的谬论彻底加以揭露和反驳。
    “八字宪法”究竟好不好呢？科学不科学呢？好得很，科学得很！实践是真理的标准。去年和今年的全部的事实都已证明，什么地方认真地切实地执行了“八字宪法”，什么地方的农业生产就发展得快，就获得了更大的丰收。远的不说，只拿今年农业生产中的若干人人皆知的事实，就可以看出农业“八字宪法”的伟大功绩，就可以看出右倾机会主义者的论调是多么荒谬。
    对“八字宪法”的攻击，大都集中在“土”、“水”、“密”、“肥”四项措施上。因为农业生产大跃进的开始，就是惊天动地的大兴水利的群众运动和大搞深翻地的群众运动。因此右倾机会主义分子大喊大叫，把“八字宪法”中“水”和“土”两项措施看成“祸根”，进行恶毒的攻击。关于这方面的荒谬议论，本报在9月7日社论“大办水利好得很”中和10月13日社论“坚持深耕深翻”中已经作了驳斥，这里就不多说了。而右倾机会主义者之所以攻击“密”字，是因为“密”字，是“八字宪法”的中心；许多措施都是围绕着“密”字实行的。农作物的产量同单位面积上的有效株数有直接关系。密植就是为了保证单位面积上有最多的有效株数。攻击“密”字的人说密植造成了减产，把个别地方由于干劲不足造成的减产，或者由于措施不当而造成的减产也归罪于“八字宪法”中的“密”字。其实，“八字宪法”中的“密”字的意思本来就是合理密植，是对过去习惯的稀植而言，并不是说不顾条件、没有限度、越密越好，这本是常识范围以内的事情。
　　右倾机会主义者混淆视听，把个别地方在小面积试验中种得过密了的事例和合理密植混为一谈，不分青红皂白，根本反对密植。无奈，事实总是不肯给右倾机会主义者帮忙。不论去年的和今年的丰产的大量事实，都证明了农作物产量的提高同合理密植有十分密切的关系。过去小麦每亩有效株数一般约在十万到二十万之间；今年，南方许多麦田每亩增加到二十至四十万株，北方许多麦田每亩增加到二十至六十万株；产量绝大部分都随着增加了。在一定的密度范围之内，株数较多的产量也就较高。据江苏省调查统计，每亩穗数在二十万到三十万之间的，亩产二百到三百斤；穗数在二十五万到三十五万之间的，亩产三百到四百斤；穗数在三十万到三十六万之间的，亩产四百斤到五百斤。据河北省调查统计，每亩有效株数在五十万以内，每增加十万株，产量约增加一百斤左右。当然，增加株数的增产作用是有一定限度的，是要同各种条件密切配合的。个别地块由于密度超过了合理的限度，或者其它措施没有配合好，因而没有得到增产的效果，这也不足为怪。在试验、探索的过程中，这是难免的事情。抓住这样的事例，攻其一点，不及其余，就否定合理密植的价值，甚至进而否定整个“八字宪法”，这是右倾机会主义者特有的思想方法。至于广大劳动农民，他们并不是这样想的。在今年春播、夏播和秋播期间，很多公社、生产队都讨论了密植问题，多数社员通过对大量事实的分析，认识了合理密植对于增产的重要作用；对个别密植不适当而减产了的，则是具体分析原因，找出改进办法。事实证明，农民群众是赞成合理密植的，不赞成的只是个别的过分密植。有右倾机会主义思想的人则大不相同，他们是以反对密植为名，行反对合理密植、反对“八字宪法”、反对总路线之实。
    “肥”字也受到了攻击。有人说“大搞群众性的积肥运动浪费了劳动力”；或者说“大搞土化肥搞糟了”；或者说“倒伏减产都是因为施肥太多了”。大量积肥是不是“得不偿失”呢？大量增产的事实就已经有力地驳斥了这个谬论。特别应当指出的是：在今春的大规模的积肥运动中，在劳动组织和工具改革方面都大有改进，肥料的质量也有所提高，许多地方还推行了田头积肥、畜圈上山等办法，同过去相比，积造同样数量质量的肥料，要少用很多劳动力。农民群众初次制造土化肥，由于缺乏经验，是走过一些弯路的；但是，这只是暂时的现象。在大造土化肥的群众运动中，迅速地查明了很多地区的土化肥资源，群众鉴别土化肥原料和制造土化肥的知识技能也迅速地提高了。施肥不当的确可以引起倒伏；但是，“八字宪法”的“肥”字本来就包括着合理施肥的意思，决不是说可以不管什么肥料、什么土壤、什么庄稼，施肥越多越好。去年8月29日中共中央关于肥料问题的指示中明明是这样规定的：“要‘按土施肥’，根据不同的土壤，施用不同的肥料，氮、磷、钾等要适当配合”；“不仅要多施肥，还要从施肥方法上尽力提高肥效”。谁要是想在两万多个公社、几十万个生产队里找一些积肥、施肥方面的缺点，那是十分容易的；可是，想以此来攻倒“八字宪法”，那却是办不到的。
    对肥料问题，除了上述的右倾机会主义的谬论以外，还有一些保守思想，例如每年在大搞积肥运动的时候，总有一些人说“无肥可积了”。这是一种悲观的老调。可是，在党的领导下，群众总是以积造大量肥料的事实回答他们。1956年，全国农田施肥水平空前提高，平均每亩施肥二十五担左右；1957年，还是二十五担左右。1958年初，就有人说，“无肥可积了”；可是，大搞群众积肥运动的结果，积肥三千亿担以上，此外还造了大量的土化肥，平均每亩施肥一、二百担。每亩施肥几百担的地方很多。1959年初，又有人说，“无肥可积了”；可是，结果，春季积肥数量和质量都超过了1958年的同一时期。
    在“种”、“保”、“管”、“工”几个方面，也都有些叽叽喳喳的议论：或者是用个别推广良种违反了因地制宜的原则的事例来攻击推广良种；或者是反对大规模采用土农药，认为没有“洋”农药就对病虫害毫无办法；或者是认为“园田化”是“形式主义”；或者是把工具改革过程中必然要有的反复试验说成是“劳民伤财”，认为改革工具不能依靠群众运动；等等。这些，有的是用个别事例武断地概括一般，不注意或者故意不谈因推广良种等措施而增产的大量事实；有的是不认识、不相信群众的力量，或者以资产阶级知识分子的轻浮的怀疑态度对待群众创造的新鲜事物。“八字宪法”是不可分的整体，其中任何一项受到损害，都会使其它各项不能充分发挥作用，都会妨碍农业的大跃进。为了群众积极性的进一步发挥，为了农业的继续大跃进，必须坚决批判从各个方面来攻击“八字宪法”的言论和行动。
    围绕着“八字宪法”展开的斗争，关系到建设社会主义是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省呢，还是泄气松劲、甘居下游、少慢差费呢。这是关系到在农业生产方面坚持总路线和反对总路线的斗争。当然，这并不是说，凡是怀疑新技术的人都是右倾机会主义分子；但是，必须提起注意：有保守思想的人最容易在不知不觉之中做了右倾机会主义的俘虏。任何因循守旧、抱残守缺的思想和态度都是错误的；只有抱着满腔热情、掌握科学规律、苦心钻研、大胆革新的思想和态度才是正确的。
    今年，农业“八字宪法”已经更清楚地显示出来了它的威力，它帮助人民公社战胜了严重的自然灾害，得到了夏秋两季丰收。在不同地区、不同季节、不同作物怎样具体地执行“八字宪法”，各个人民公社已经有了更多更好的经验。目前，正是总结今年执行农业“八字宪法”的经验和应用这些经验争取明年更大丰收的最好的时机。各地各人民公社都要在“八字宪法”的一般规律指导下，进一步寻求在不同地区、不同作物实行“八字宪法”的特殊规律，制定继续大跃进的具体措施，充分运用人民公社的强大力量实现这些措施，为争取明年的农业生产继续大跃进而奋勇前进。
