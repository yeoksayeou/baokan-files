Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: The latest achievement of the Soviet Union in successfully launching its third cosmic rocket has astonished scientists in countries such as the United States, Britain, and France.
　　The Director of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Glennan, said that American scientists "understand the significance of this attempt to launch a rocket around the moon and extend our congratulations." He stated, "We, along with other scientific institutions around the world, look forward to the data from this new rocket as it travels between Earth and the moon."
　　Dr. Waterman, head of the National Science Foundation, said that he believes it is "extremely important" that Soviet scientists can accurately predict the orbit of cosmic rockets and specify the distance the rocket will pass the moon even a day and a half earlier.
　　According to a dispatch from Washington by Agence France-Presse on the 4th, American scientists, who in the past still held "doubts and reservations" about the Soviet Union's missile launch capabilities being superior to those of the United States, have had to "revise their estimates" in the face of the Soviet Union's latest achievements. The dispatch believes that, compared to the Soviet Union's achievements, the series of "Explorer" small satellite launches by the United States are "merely a faint spark."
　　The "New York Times" also admitted in its editorial on the 5th that "... without a doubt, the Soviet Union's recent two achievements in rockets prove that the United States still lags far behind the Soviet Union in space exploration and rocket capabilities."
　　British scientists do not conceal their admiration for the latest achievements of their Soviet counterparts.
　　Davis, a scientist at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Britain, said when talking about the new achievements of Soviet science: "It is amazing that the Russians have launched another rocket in such a short time after the last launch." He said that this new experiment "may bring back a lot of new material about the surface of the moon, much more than we have obtained so far."
　　Gatland, vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, said that the launch of the new rocket is "undoubtedly a major step forward" in conquering the universe. He said it has become difficult to find the right adjectives to "describe or praise the Soviet Union's achievements in space."
　　Dr. Martin, assistant secretary of the Royal Society, pointed out that the new achievements of Soviet science are more outstanding than ever before. Martin said: "This is new proof of the achievements of Soviet scientists and engineers in cosmic research."
　　Professor Massey, chairman of the Rocket Subcommittee of the Royal Society, said that this is a very significant achievement, marking a new stage in navigation and manipulation technology.
　　London's "Daily Telegraph" commented today that the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third cosmic rocket proves that "Soviet scientists have maintained their leading position over the Americans and have lengthened the lead. The Americans are their only important competitor in this regard."
　　Vassy, head of the French official rocket research institution, professor of astrophysics at the University of Paris, and a rocket expert, said: "Technically speaking, the new rocket is a remarkable achievement, especially considering its weight."

    苏联火箭新成就震动西方世界
    科学家普遍叹服　报界指出美国远远落在后面
    据新华社5日讯　美英法等国的科学家赞叹苏联成功发射第三支宇宙火箭的卓越成就。
    美国全国星际和空间航行局局长格伦南说，美国科学家“了解发射一支火箭环绕月球这一尝试的意义，并且表示我们的祝贺”。他说：“我们同世界上其他科学机构一起期待着这支新火箭在地球和月球之间遨游的资料。”
    全国科学基金会负责人华特曼博士说，他认为，苏联科学家能够精确地预测出宇宙火箭的轨道并且能在一天半以前，甚至更早些时候指明火箭绕过月球时的距离，这是“极为重要的”。
    据法新社4日自华盛顿发出的一条电讯中透露，过去对苏联的导弹发射能力比美国优越这一点还抱有“怀疑和保留态度”的美国科学家，今天在苏联的最新成就面前已经不得不“修正他们的估计”。这条电讯认为，同苏联的成就相比，美国一系列“探索者”小卫星的发射“仅仅是一个微弱的火花”。
    “纽约时报”在5日的社论中也承认说，“……毫无疑问，苏联最近在火箭上的两个成就证明，在空间探索和火箭能力方面，美国仍然大大落后于苏联。”
    英国科学家们毫不掩饰他们对于苏联同行们所取得的最新成就的钦佩心情。
    英国焦德雷耳班克天文台的科学家戴维斯在谈到苏联科学的新成就时说：“俄国人能够在上次发射后这样短暂的时间内又发射一支火箭，真是惊人。”他说，这次新的试验“可能会带回许多有关月球表面情况的新材料，比迄今为止我们所已经获得的材料要多得多。”
    英国皇家星际学会副主席加特兰说，新火箭的发射在征服宇宙方面“无疑是向前迈进了一大步”。他说，要找出恰当的形容词来“描述或颂扬苏联在空间方面的成就”已经成为困难的事了。
    皇家学会助理秘书马丁博士指出，苏联科学的新成就比以往的更为杰出。马丁说：“这是苏联科学家和工程师在宇宙研究方面所取得成就的新证明。”
    皇家学会火箭小组委员会主席马西教授说，这是非常巨大的成就，它标志着在导航和操纵技术方面进入了新阶段。
    伦敦“每日电讯报”今天在评论中认为，苏联成功发射第三支宇宙火箭的消息证明，“苏联科学家保持了他们超越美国人而领先的地位，并且拉长了领先的距离。美国人是他们在这方面的仅有的重要竞赛对手。”
    法国官方火箭研究机构负责人、巴黎大学天体物理学教授、火箭学专家瓦西说：“从技术上说，新火箭是非凡的成就，特别是考虑到它的重量。”
