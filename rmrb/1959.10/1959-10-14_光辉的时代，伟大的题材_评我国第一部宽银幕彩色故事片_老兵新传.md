A Glorious Era, A Great Subject
　　——On China's First Widescreen Color Feature Film "Song of the Veteran"
　　Situ Huimin
　　In literary and artistic works, what often moves people and is most educational are not bizarre stories or strange characters with three heads and six arms, but ordinary things and ordinary people that everyone can experience in life and encounter in thought. "Song of the Veteran" depicts the many ordinary things in our glorious era. The characters it portrays are not a rare minority in this era, but tens of thousands of soldiers on the revolutionary and construction fronts, who have been nurtured, nourished, and tempered by this glorious era, and who have added glory to this era. It is of great significance for Chinese filmmakers to create China's first widescreen stereophonic feature film based on the great themes of this glorious era as a gift to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.
　　The story of "Song of the Veteran" takes place in 1948, before the birth of New China, when our War of Liberation was still raging and the army was advancing from north to south. At the same time, some of the People's Liberation Army, like Lao Zhan, the farm manager of the first state-owned farm in the film, and other demobilized soldiers, had been transferred to a corner of the far north of China to reclaim a large area of sparsely populated and desolate virgin land. The film begins with Lao Zhan arriving in this icy and snowy place with two young men.
　　It can be said that there is no sign of human habitation there, and if people did not have unparalleled perseverance and courage, they would not be able to stay there for a day. However, these people finally overcame all difficulties and turned that barren land into fertile fields of thousands of hectares. A few selfish and self-interested people were transformed here, and the strong were tempered to be even stronger. People learned about nature and transformed nature through life and labor. A year or two later, it was already possible to obtain a bumper harvest to support the southward liberation army with grain; the farm finally became a well-equipped state-owned farm with rich production experience and strong manpower.
　　"Song of the Veteran" demonstrates the typical characters and typical events of our new China. During the Moscow International Film Festival in August this year, I heard some foreign friends discuss the theme of this film. A few friends from Western capitalist countries thought that this theme was difficult to understand. Simply put: What did people like Lao Zhan fight for in such an extremely difficult environment? When he had built the farm to a preliminary scale and obtained a bumper harvest, he was required to transfer to another place, but he did not care and left the achievements he had created to others. What was he doing this for? It was simply incomprehensible. I think it is not surprising that some friends in Western capitalist countries do not understand such a theme. In those countries, the pursuit of personal enjoyment and personal fame and fortune is a common occurrence. If there is one person or a group of people who do things without considering their own gains and losses, but wholeheartedly for others and for everyone; perhaps some things are done today not to get a harvest today, but for the future, or even for the next generation - such people, like farm manager Lao Zhan, would be considered crazy in Western capitalist societies, or considered to be non-existent. At the Moscow Film Festival, we met many friends who knew something about the current situation in China. They shared our view that such a theme is very realistic for expressing our era, the current situation in China, and for expressing the new people and new things who are building socialism today. In particular, the depiction of Lao Zhan accepting new tasks from the Party and the state, handing over his weapons to his comrades to continue to eliminate the enemy, and going to engage in the most unfamiliar production and construction work. Many of these people were experts in eliminating the enemy on the revolutionary front, but they became amateurs in the socialist production and construction on the industrial, mining, and rural fronts. After not too long, these people finally used their tenacious and courageous spirit to bring into play the experience and wisdom they had tempered in battle, turning from beginners to skilled workers, and from amateurs to experts. Such people and such things are very typical in today's China. The long-tempered Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are now participating in production and construction in almost all large and small factories and mines on various socialist construction fronts. Such examples can be seen everywhere in today's China, from south to north, from east to west. This theme also shows that the armed forces of the Chinese people are not only able to resist and eliminate the enemy in order to defend the interests of the people, but also a magnificent force for defending peace and carrying out peaceful construction.
　　Any film, if the characters it portrays are flesh and blood, and have the breath of life, it will naturally make us feel like familiar acquaintances; although their age, occupation, temperament, character, life, and habits are different, they will still make people feel that such a spiritual outlook is very kind and easy to understand and infect for any of us. This basis lies in whether the theme is realistic and whether it can express the spiritual essence of the era it depicts. On this point, the theme of "Song of the Veteran" provides good conditions for actors to shape characters. Lao Zhan in the film is an old People's Liberation Army soldier from a peasant background, who is frank and straightforward, always optimistic about the Party, the revolutionary cause, and the ideal of the future, and who is conscientious and unwavering. Sometimes he shows a strong peasant temperament, stubbornness, and a bit of rudeness; sometimes he makes people laugh, but he is not stupid. Such people are very common among the People's Liberation Army soldiers. Such people dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the Party and to the revolutionary cause of the people, without considering their personal fame, fortune, status, and enjoyment. They do whatever the Party needs them to do, without fear of difficulties; even in extremely difficult conditions, they do not complain, do not bargain, do not shirk responsibility, and move forward courageously to complete arduous tasks. Can such people stand firm in capitalist societies? But in our socialist country, they are constantly growing and increasing. It is precisely because we have thousands of heroic figures like Lao Zhan that it is truly worthy of pride for our generation of Chinese people. Cui Wei's performance, on the whole, is very appropriate. As long as he appears on the screen, he will convincingly believe that the character of Lao Zhan really exists and is imprinted in the minds of every audience. This is mainly because he understands the inner world of this character very deeply and very truthfully. When people watch this movie, even if they don't pay much attention to his every subtle movement (in fact, he has very few subtle movements), it is very easy for the audience to understand what he is thinking in his heart and what his behavior means, and to infect the audience. For example, he despises those incorrect remarks and those who do not understand the truth, but on the other hand, he still reasonably persuades them, just like the scene when he called on workers in a small town to reclaim the Great Northern Wilderness. At the beginning, most people did not understand him, and he was ridiculed there. Although he did not say a lot of words, he sincerely persuaded the many people who doubted or opposed him; especially important was his firm and unwavering attitude towards the truth.
　　The character of senior intellectual expert Professor Zhao Songyun is also clearly portrayed, especially when juxtaposed with people of Lao Zhan's type. The characteristics of both sides, the two types, and the two personalities are more prominent. In terms of stubbornness and seriousness, both of these are very stubborn and very serious people, but Lao Zhan's stubbornness is in maintaining the interests of the Party and the people. In order to be able to produce more grain and support the liberation army, he is eager to try to find ways. Zhao Songyun's stubbornness and seriousness, however, focuses more on how to maintain his reputation, lest he lose face. Lao Zhan said: Being able to produce one more point of grain means one more point of support for the liberation army; Zhao Songyun said: The grain harvest must reach a certain standard, otherwise, as a state-owned farm, it would be disgraceful to produce less. Zhao Songyun is inclined towards bookish and scientific theoretical knowledge; Lao Zhan is a person who has never had book knowledge, lacks scientific theory, but has gained some practical knowledge in several years of production training. Due to these two differences, sharp conflicts in personality occurred between the two collaborators, and the film also develops this conflict. Han Tao, who plays Zhao Songyun, is also very serious and meticulous in shaping this character. But I feel that the script and the director's handling of the development and resolution of the contradictions between these two characters is not detailed enough or clear enough. For example, the biggest conflict is that Lao Zhan advocates immediate cultivation in the same year in order to produce more grain to support the front line, while Zhao Songyun insists on fallowing for one year based on book knowledge and scientific theory. When the wheat seedlings grow out, Lao Zhan and some young people are more confident, while Professor Zhao Songyun believes that there is no reason to be optimistic. The contradiction becomes more obvious, and it is not until later when people discover that the wheat has gone bad, that there should be a conclusion to resolve this sharp contradiction between the two. But this point is not clear enough in the image of the film. The audience can only understand that Lao Zhan suffered some losses due to a lack of experience in northern farming, but his enthusiasm for the cause is moving; and although Professor Zhao does not get the audience's sympathy, he also seems to have a scientific theoretical basis. In short, the development and resolution of the contradiction is not clear enough in the film.
　　At the same time, some places where major contradictions are resolved are not detailed enough. Such as the contradiction between a group of young intellectuals who have just arrived at the farm and Lao Zhan. The young people who have just been transferred from the city to the farm have various illusions about the state-owned farm, thinking that they live in buildings, and tractors and combines are like fleets on the sea, and life is more beautiful and comfortable than in the city; of course, some people know that they will encounter many difficulties in life and work, but in his
  In their imagination, in their subjective wishes, since it is a state-owned farm, the difficulties will always be less than imagined, and there should always be a beautiful enjoyment in life. This and Lao Zhan's fighting spirit, not being afraid of difficulties, not being afraid of hard work, and not caring about the contradiction of enjoyment, created very intriguing dramatic plots. At the party that welcomed this group of new people who came to work at the farm, when the young people happily danced, Lao Zhan suddenly stopped their dancing; then when the young people drew cartoons to satirize him for having feudal thoughts, he explained extremely simply and clearly: When the farm is still very difficult, not only dancing is not allowed, but marriage is not allowed... because there is no place for everyone to live yet, where is there a way to build a nursery? These few words simply and clearly explained that the reason why he stopped dancing was not because of feudal thoughts, but because of his enthusiasm for the development of the cause, and he also made very practical plans. Even if it is said that certain behaviors of such characters have certain weaknesses, such as only thinking about labor and not considering rest, in such a difficult environment at that time, as long as the problem is clarified, it is also very understandable and sympathetic to people. In dealing with this series of contradictions between the young people and Lao Zhan, it is not concise and prominent enough, and the前后 is not enough to correspond to each other. Since we know that he stopped the young people from dancing in front, and made a reasonable explanation, if we could add a line after the end of the conference where the young people held the wedding: Lao Zhan suggested, now is the time for us to dance! How good would that be! Ending this contradiction in this way would have a very good and complete前後照应.
　　There are many characters in the entire movie. In addition to Lao Zhan, Professor Zhao Songyun, Xiao Dongzi, a group of intellectuals, handicraftsmen and drivers who came to the farm from the city, there are also Zhou Qinghe, who was contaminated with a body of dirt from the old society and needs to continue to be transformed. For such a theme with many characters, complex events, and a very long time process, the director and scriptwriter have made a lot of efforts to ensure that the theme of the film is always clear. Before the start of production, when I read the script for the first time, I already liked this theme, but I was once worried about two things. The first is how to be able to extract the essence and select the essence of the literary script when writing and directing the script, so that the theme thought content and structure are more perfect; the second is the description of the character Lao Zhan, which must be realistic and specific. There must be a full and convincing description of his advantages, and there is no need to conceal his shortcomings, but it must be written that in the difficult situation at that time and in the constantly developing and changing environment, certain shortcomings are inevitable, and these shortcomings are not the mainstream of this type of character, otherwise it will damage the image of this character, and thus affect this beautiful theme. Regarding the second point, the director did make a lot of efforts in the writing process and production of the director's script, and it still looks very good on the finished film. As for the first point, it is indeed not refined enough in expressing such a complex character, event, and theme. Some characters in the film, such as Zhou Qinghe, Lao Zhan's son Yun Sheng, etc., only show some unconnected rough lines. The development and changes of these characters' personalities, as well as the events that occur on them or around them, have not been carefully and completely processed. Of course, this does not require a lot of space to make many detailed depictions, but as branches and leaves, it is also necessary to give people a complete impression, otherwise the appearance of these characters will become a dark shadow that does not work or works very little.
　　In the past, many of our films, like novels or stage plays, relied too much on lengthy dialogues, and even used narration or voice-overs to explain or describe the changes in the plot, the psychological states of the characters, etc. The description and explanation of language replaced action. Sometimes, it also excessively captured many unnecessary processes, making the movie plot seem like lush branches and leaves covering the main trunk. In "Song of the Veteran", it can be seen that director Shen Fu has made a lot of efforts in this regard. Especially in the production of the first widescreen stereophonic feature film, there are so many characters and the story is relatively complicated. In terms of mastering the characteristics of the film, there are many places in the film that are worthy of praise and loved by the audience: such as the scene where the wheat grows green seedlings. Xiao Dongzi, Lao Zhan, and another farm worker, Cheng Guoliang, each took a small handful of wheat seedlings and reported the good news to each other, expressing their excitement about the first time that green seedlings grew on this virgin land that was being reclaimed, and also expressing their concern for the Party's cause. This is an extremely clear image that concisely portrays the characters and explains the changes of things. This is truly one of the best examples of mastering the characteristics of the film.
　　But there are also some places that are not satisfactory enough. For example, the scene where Lao Zhan led the masses of the farm to help fight the bandits and rob back the looted grain is like a dark scene in a stage play that is restricted by scene changes and technical conditions, and relies entirely on dialogue to explain. This is indeed not a good film expression technique. Some places wrote some scenes with unclear purpose and insufficient expression: such as the lengthy shots of the fire burning the grassland, and the scene of the young people's discussions after the wheat had a problem. These made the narrative and development process of the film very slow and even stagnant. The audience only saw people talking a lot, and never saw the image of the bad wheat; the connection between the people who cared about the wheat and the bad wheat was not clear enough in the image. This is where the process of handling cinematization is not detailed enough. From "Song of the Veteran", we can find that the extremely important issue of how to master the characteristics of the film, how to cinematize and visualize the film literary script still requires our film creators to explore.
　　As China's first widescreen stereophonic feature film, the director, photography, and sound recording staff of "Song of the Veteran" have made great achievements in mastering this new technology, which should be congratulated. Widescreen stereophonic movies have only appeared and been promoted in the world film industry for about five years, and in our country for only two years, but our filmmakers have bravely taken on the task of trying to apply this new technology in "Song of the Veteran", and there are indeed many things that have been done very well, which is not easy. Through the production of this feature film, we have accumulated a lot of new experience and become familiar with new expression methods. The director decided to use widescreen to express the Great Northern Wilderness, the vast wilderness, the desolate ice and snow, and the ocean-like wheat waves after the farm was established, and the surging crowds, which is very suitable. The stereophonic recording of many scenes is very well handled, which has made a good embellishment to the film in terms of effect and dramatic atmosphere. Especially when it is expressed at the party to welcome the new young people who have been transferred to the farm, when the young people sing and the masses at the party sing along with her, the main singer on the screen first makes a solo sound, and then the chorus sings from the front, back, left, and right of the movie theater, so that every audience in the theater is as if he has personally participated in the party and is on the scene. This is a very good stereophonic processing and utilization. It should be said that this film, as an exploration by Chinese filmmakers in the use of new technologies, is a good start. From here, we can understand the reason why "Song of the Veteran" won the "High Technical Achievement Award" at the Moscow International Film Festival held in August this year.
　　"Song of the Veteran" is a work of Chinese film work under the shining of the general line, gradually tending to mature in the Great Leap Forward. Although we can point out some unsatisfactory technical skills, it is, after all, an excellent film.

　　光辉的时代，伟大的题材
　　——评我国第一部宽银幕彩色故事片“老兵新传”
　　司徒慧敏
    在文学艺术作品中，最能感动人、而又最有教育意义的，常常不是那些离奇的故事，三头六臂的古怪人物，而是人人在生活中可能体会到、人人在思想上可以接触到的平常的事和平常的人。“老兵新传”就是描写在我们光辉的时代里，那许多平常的事物。它所描写的人物在这个时代里，不是稀有的少数人，而是成千上万在革命战线上、在建设战线上的战士，他们得到了光辉时代的熏陶、滋养与锻炼，而又为这个时代增添了光彩。中国电影工作者，以描写这个光辉的时代的伟大题材制作成中国第一部宽银幕立体声故事片，作为庆祝伟大祖国建国十周年献礼，是有着重大意义的。
    “老兵新传”的故事发生于新中国诞生以前的1948年，那时我们的解放战争还在激烈地进行着，大军正从北方向南推进。同时，一部分人民解放军，如影片中第一个国营农场的场长、转业军人老战那样的人，已经和他的战友们被调到中国极北的一个角上，开垦一大片人迹稀少、满目荒凉的处女地。影片就从老战带着两个年轻人到达这块冰天雪地开始。
    那里可以说杳无人烟，如果人们没有那无比的毅力和勇气，是一天也待不下去的。然而这些人终于克服了一切困难，把那块荒地变成了万顷良田，少数自私自利的人在这里得到改造，坚强的人锻炼得更加坚强。人们从生活和劳动中认识了自然，改造了自然。一二年以后，那里已经能够获得丰收，以粮食支援当时南下的解放大军；农场也终于成为设备完善、有丰富的生产经验和强大的人力的国营农场。
    “老兵新传”表现了我们新中国的典型人物与典型事例。在今年8月参加莫斯科国际电影节比赛期间，我听到国外一些朋友们，对于这部影片题材的议论。少数来自西方资本主义国家的朋友，认为这个题材很难令人理解，简单地说就是：像老战这样的人，在那种艰难绝顶的环境中苦斗，他为的是什么？等他把农场办得初具规模得到丰收的时候，又需要他转到别的地方去，他却毫不计较就把亲手创造下来的成果留给别人，又为的是什么？简直不可理解。我想西方资本主义国家的一些朋友们，对于这样的一个题材之不可理解，是不足为奇的。在那些国家里，追求个人享乐、个人名利是习以为常的事情。如果说有那么一个人或一群人，他或者他们的所作所为不计较自己的得失，而全心全意地为了别人、为了大家；也许有一些今天做了的事情，不是为了今天能够得到收成，而是为了将来，甚至为了下一代——这样的人，就是老战场长那样的人，在西方资本主义社会，他会被人认为是个疯子，或者被认为根本不存在的人。在莫斯科电影节中我们却遇到不少对中国当前情况有所了解的朋友，他们和我们有个共同的看法，认为这样一个题材，对于表现我们的时代、当前中国的情况，对于表现今天在建设社会主义的新人新事是非常现实的。特别是描写老战那样接受党和国家的新任务，把武装交给自己的战友继续去消灭敌人，自己却去从事最不熟悉的生产建设工作。这许多人在消灭敌人的革命战线上都是好手，都是内行；但是在工矿、农村中从事社会主义生产建设战线上，就变成外行了。经过不怎么长的时间，这许多人终于用他们坚毅勇敢的精神，发挥战斗中锻炼成长的经验与智慧，变生手为熟手，变外行为内行。这样的人，这样的事，在今天的中国，那是再典型不过的了。久经锻炼的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军，今天在社会主义建设各个生产战线上，几乎所有大小规模的厂矿都有他们参加生产建设。这种事例，在今天的中国，自南到北，自东到西，处处可见。这个题材，也表现了中国人民的武装力量，不仅能够为了捍卫人民利益而抗击敌人，消灭敌人；而且也是保卫和平和进行和平建设的雄伟力量。
    任何一部影片，如果它所描写的人物是有血有肉，有生活的气息，他会自然而然地使我们感到有如常见的熟人；尽管他们年龄、职业、气质、性格、生活、习惯各有不同，但同样会令人感到那样的精神面貌，对于我们任何一个人都非常亲切和易于理解、易于感染的。这个基础就在于题材之是否现实，是否能够表现它所描写的那个时代的精神实质。关于这一点，“老兵新传”这个题材，为演员塑造人物提供了很好的条件。影片中老战这个人，是农民出身的一位老解放军战士，为人坦率爽直，对党对革命事业、对于未来的理想永远保持乐观，并且克尽职守，坚贞不移，有时显得有浓厚的农民气质，执拗也带着几分粗鲁；有时使人发笑，但也非愚笨。这样的人，在解放军战士中非常普遍，这样的人把自己一心一意地献给党，献给人民的革命事业，而丝毫也不计较自己个人的名利地位和享受。党需要他干什么他就干什么，毫不害怕困难；即使在极端困难条件下，他也是不埋怨，不讲价钱，不推诿责任，勇往向前，完成艰巨的任务。这样的人在资本主义社会能够站得住脚吗？而在我们社会主义国家里，却不断地成长，不断地增加着。正因为我们有了成千上万像老战这样的英雄人物，才真值得我们这一代的中国人引以自豪的。崔嵬在他全部表演中，总的说来是很恰当的。只要他在银幕上一出现，就会使人信服地认为老战这个人物确实存在，而且印在每一个观众的心目中。这主要是由于他理解这个人物的内心世界是非常深，也是非常真的。当人们在看这部电影时，即使不太注意他每一个细微的动作（其实他是很少细微动作的），可是他心里在想什么？他的行为意味着什么？都很容易为观众所理解，感染观众。如表现他一面蔑视那些不正确的言论，蔑视那不懂道理的人，但是另外一面他仍然合情合理地向他们进行说服，就像他在一个小城镇号召工人到北大荒开垦的那个场面，开始大多数人对他是不了解的，他在那里为人们所讥笑，他虽然没有说很多话，但是他诚恳地说服了那许多对他怀疑或者表示反对的人；尤其重要的是他那种坚决的、对于真理的坚信不疑的态度。
    高级知识分子专家教授赵松筠这个人物，也刻划得很清楚，特别是与老战这个类型的人并列在一起，双方的特点、两种类型、两种性格就更为突出。就从固执、认真这一点来说，这两个都是十分固执也十分认真的人，可是老战固执的是在维护党与人民利益上面，为了能够多打一点粮食，支援解放大军，他迫不及待地去想尽办法。而赵松筠的固执认真，却更多地着重于如何保持名誉，惟恐失面子。老战说：能多打一分粮食，就给解放大军多支援了一分力量；赵松筠说：粮食收成，必须达到一定的标准，否则作为国营农场，少打了也是不光彩的。赵松筠是偏重于书本上的、科学理论知识的人；老战则是一个从没有书本知识，缺乏科学理论，而在几年的生产锻炼中获得一些实际知识的人。由于这两方面的差别，造成他们两个合作者间性格上尖锐的冲突，影片中也发展了这个冲突。饰演赵松筠的韩涛对于这个人物的塑造也很认真细致。但我感到缺憾的是剧本和导演的处理上，对于这两个人物之间的矛盾的发展和解决，不够细致，不够清楚。比如最大的一场冲突是老战主张立刻在当年进行耕作，为的是多打粮食支援前线，而赵松筠则根据书本知识和科学理论上的道理坚持必须休耕一年。待麦秧长出来了，老战和一些年轻人信心更足，而老教授赵松筠则认为未可乐观。矛盾发展得更加明显，一直到后来人们发觉麦子坏了的时候，谁的道理对，似乎应该有一个定论来解决他们两者之间这一个尖锐矛盾。但是这一点，在影片的形象上是不够清楚的，观众只能够意会老战由于缺乏北方耕种的经验，使工作受到了一些损失，但对事业的热心是感动人的；而赵教授虽得不到观众的同情，但似乎也有科学理论上的根据。总之矛盾的发展和解决在影片中不够清楚。
    同时，有些地方大的矛盾解决了，但不够细致。如一群新到农场里来的青年知识分子和老战之间的矛盾。刚从城市里调到农场来的青年们，他们对国营农场抱着各种各样的幻想，以为住的是楼房，拖拉机、康拜因像海上的舰队，生活比城市还要美丽舒适；当然也有一些人知道他们在生活中、工作中会遇到不少困难，但在他
  们的想像中，在他们的主观愿望中，既然是国营农场，困难总会比想像中少些，生活上总该有美好的享受。这和老战的一股战斗劲头，不畏困难，不怕劳累，不计较享受的性格的矛盾，造成了很耐人寻味的戏剧情节。在农场欢迎这群新参加工作的人们那个晚会上，当青年们兴高采烈地跳起舞来的时候，老战突然制止了他们的跳舞；随后当青年们画起漫画来讽刺他有封建思想的时候，他却极其简单而又明确地解说：在农场还很艰苦的时候，不但不许跳舞，还不许结婚，……因为现在大家住的地方还没有满足呢，那里有办法盖起托儿所来呢？这几句话，很简单明了地说明了他之所以制止跳舞，并非由于封建思想，而是出于对事业发展，抱着一股热诚，也作了很实际的打算，即使说这样人物的某些行为，虽然有一定的弱点，如一股劲只想到劳动，而没有考虑休息，但是在当时那样困难的环境中，只要把问题弄明白了，也是很能理解，而又为人们所同情的。在处理青年们与老战之间这一系列的矛盾中，还不够简练突出，前后也不够照应，我们既然知道前面他制止了青年的跳舞，而又作了合乎情理的说明，要是在青年们举行婚礼那个大会结束以后，能够添上一笔：老战建议，现在该是我们跳舞的时候了！这该多好啊！以这样来结束这个矛盾，就会有很好很完整的前后照应了。
    全部电影中出现的人物很多，除了前面说到的老战、赵松筠教授、小冬子、一群知识青年、由城市到农场参加工作的手工业者和司机等，此外还有从旧社会里沾染了一身污泥，需要继续接受改造的周清河。对于这样人物众多、事件繁复、时间过程又很长的题材，导演和剧本作者尽了很多努力，才能使影片的主题始终是明确的。在开始制作之前，我第一次读到剧本的时候，我已经喜爱这个题材，但我曾经担心过，第一就是如何能够在编写导演剧本的时候，把文学剧本中许多优美的地方，撷精取华使主题思想内容和结构更完美；其次是老战这个人物的描写，既要真实而具体，对于他的优点要有充分的、令人信服的描绘，对于他的缺点也不必隐讳，但必须写出在当时那种困难和在不断发展变化的环境中，某些缺点是难免的，而这些缺点并不是这种人物身上的主流，否则就会损害这个人物的形象，因而也影响到这个优美的主题的。关于第二点在导演剧本的编写过程和制作中，导演的确尽了很大的努力，目前在完成片上看来还是很好的。至于第一点，在表现这样一个复杂的人物、事件和题材上确实还不够精炼。影片上一些人物，如周清河、老战的儿子云生等等，只表现一些接连不上的粗线，无论这些人物的性格发展变化，以及在他们身上，或在周围发生的事件，都没有加以细致完整的处理。当然这并不需要费很大的篇幅来作许多细节描画，但作为枝叶来说，也需要使人有个完整的印象才好，否则这些人物的出现，就成为不发生作用或作用很少的暗影了。
    我们过去有不少影片同小说或舞台剧一样，过多依靠冗长的对话，甚至使用旁白或画外音来说明或者描述剧情的变化、人物的心理状态等等，语言的描述和说明代替了动作。有时又过多地摄取了许多不必要的过程，使电影情节上好像是繁茂的枝叶掩蔽了主干。在“老兵新传”中，可以看得出导演沈浮在这个上面是作了不少努力的，尤其是摄制第一部宽银幕立体声故事片，人物又那么多，故事也比较复杂，在掌握电影特性方面，影片中有不少值得称赞、使观众喜爱的地方：如发现麦子长出青苗那一场，小冬子、老战和另一位农场工人程国亮三个人各拿了一小撮麦秧，相互报喜，表示他们对第一次在这块被开垦的处女地上长出青苗的兴奋心情，也表示他们对党的事业的关切。这是以极其明快的形象，简洁地刻划了人物，又说明了事物的变化，这真正是掌握电影特性的最好的范例之一。
    但也有一些地方还不够令人满意。例如老战带领了农场的群众去帮助打土匪，把劫去的粮食抢回来那一场，真像舞台剧中受场景变换、技术条件的限制的暗场戏，完完全全依靠对话来说明，这确实不是好的电影表现手法。有些地方写了一些目的性不明、表现力不足的场景：如火烧草原的冗长的镜头，在麦子出了问题之后青年人的议论纷纷等场面，由于这些使影片的叙述与发展过程非常迂缓甚至停滞。观众只见人们议论纷纷，始终看不见麦子坏了的形象；关怀着麦子的人们和坏了的麦子两者之间的联系，在形象上也不够清楚，这是处理电影化的过程不够细致的地方。从“老兵新传”中我们可以发现，如何掌握电影特性，如何使电影文学剧本电影化、形象化，这个极其重要的问题，还需要我们电影创作工作者去努力探讨。
    作为中国第一部宽银幕立体声故事电影出现的“老兵新传”，在掌握这种新技术方面，影片的导演、摄影、录音各方面的工作者做出了很好的成绩，这是应该向他们庆贺的。宽银幕立体声电影出现和推广在世界影坛上不过五年左右，在我国还不过两年光景，但是我们的电影工作者，在“老兵新传”中，把应用这个新技术的尝试工作很勇敢地担当起来，也确实有很多做得很好的地方，是不容易的。通过这部故事片的摄制，使我们积累了不少新的经验，熟习了新的表现方法。导演决定用宽银幕来表现北大荒那块未开垦的处女地，广漠的原野，荒凉的冰天雪地以及建立了农场以后那海洋一样的麦浪，万头汹涌的群众场面，这是非常合适的。有许多场面的立体声录音，处理得非常好，给这部影片在效果上，在戏剧气氛上都作了很好的润色。特别是表现在欢迎新调到农场来的青年们那个晚会上，当青年唱起歌来，晚会上群众跟着她合唱起来的那个场面，先由银幕上主唱的人发出独唱的声音，随后电影院里，前后左右发出合唱的歌声来，使影院里每个观众，如同他自己也亲自参加了那个晚会，身历其境一样，这是很好的立体声的处理和利用。应该说这部影片作为中国电影工作者对于使用新技术的探索，是一个良好的开端。从这里我们可以理解在今年8月间举行的莫斯科国际电影节中，“老兵新传”所以会获得“高度技术成就奖”的原因。
    “老兵新传”是我们中国电影工作在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进中，逐渐趋向于成熟的作品，虽然我们可以指出若干技术技巧上的不尽满意之处，但毕竟是一部优秀的影片。
