    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch: An anti-"Security Treaty" modification struggle emerges as a force.
    400,000 Japanese University Students Demonstrate
    Kishi Nobusuke's Smuggling Missile Conspiracy Incites New Wave of Popular Anger

    Tokyo News: 400,000 university students across Japan held rallies and demonstrations today to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    A total of 121 student self-government associations from 90 universities participated in this nationwide joint struggle.
    In Tokyo, students held a central rally to block the revision of the "Security Treaty." Approximately 12,000 male and female students from about ten universities attended. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution expressing the students' determination to work with the working class to launch a decisive national strike. The resolution also emphasized that they would support the coal miners' union's opposition to "enterprise rationalization" and the struggle to prevent the import of "Sidewinder" missiles.
    Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, emphasized at the meeting that the students' struggle today plays a vital role in the current national movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty."
    Mihara Akira, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, called on the students to take the lead in smashing the common conspiracy of American and Japanese imperialists to revise the "Security Treaty."
    Kazami Akira, representing the National Conference for the Protection of the Constitution, stated that the students' just struggle would eventually be victorious.
    After the meeting, students marched in the streets of Tokyo in the rain. The banners and placards they carried read: "No more wars," "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet," and "Neutrality is the only path to peace." The demonstrators shouted in front of the "Defense Agency": "Oppose nuclear armament," "Oppose the import of Sidewinder missiles." They shouted in front of the Ministry of Education building: "Oppose the implementation of the teacher performance evaluation system," and "Oppose militaristic education."
    One thousand night school students also held a rally and demonstration tonight.
    This newspaper reports that in order to implement nuclear armament and establish missile bases, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government is secretly plotting to transport a large number of American "Sidewinder" missiles despite strong opposition from people from all walks of life.
    According to the Japanese "Tokyo Shimbun," the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Defense Agency" is preparing to take two measures. One is to take advantage of the fact that mass organizations opposing the import of missiles are unprepared and secretly transport them to Tachikawa base and other places using U.S. military transport planes. The other is to package the "Sidewinder" missiles together with other U.S. military supplies and transport them to Japan on U.S. military ships. The "Tokyo Shimbun" said that the "Defense Agency" has formulated a plan to purchase a large number of American "Sidewinder" missiles, and it is planned to conduct launch exercises in the sea near Honshu in February and March next year.
    Faced with the danger of nuclear armament, the Japanese people are waging a resolute struggle against the war policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, centering on the opposition to the import of American "Sidewinder" missiles. The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and "Sōhyō" have all condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's nuclear armament plan and mobilized people from all walks of life to carry out a widespread movement against the import of missiles. Ten Japanese dockworkers' and seafarers' unions have launched a struggle to refuse to unload missiles.

    反对修改“安全条约”斗争异军突起
    日本四十万大学生示威游行
    岸信介偷运导弹阴谋激起人民新怒潮
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本全国四十万大学生今天举行集会、示威游行，抗议岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”。
    参加这次全国性联合斗争的共有九十个大学的一百二十一个学生自治会的学生。
    在东京，学生们举行了阻止修改“安全条约”中央大会。到会的有大约十个大学的一万二千名男女学生。大会一致通过决议，表示学生决心要尽力同工人阶级一起展开决定性的全国罢课。决议还强调说，他们将支持反对“企业合理化”的煤矿工会和为阻止运入“响尾蛇式”导弹的斗争。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在会上强调说，学生们今天的斗争对目前反对修改“安全条约”的国民运动起着十分重要的作用。
    日本共产党中央委员会委员米原昶号召学生们，带头粉碎美日帝国主义分子的共同阴谋——修改“安全条约”。
    风见章代表拥护宪法国民会议讲话时指出，学生的正义斗争终将获得胜利。
    会后，学生们冒雨在东京大街上游行。他们拿着的横幅和标语牌上写道：“不允许再发生战争”、“打倒岸信介内阁”、“中立是走向和平的唯一道路”。游行者在“防卫厅”前高呼：“反对进行核武装”、“反对运入响尾蛇式导弹”。他们在文部省办公楼前高呼：“反对对教师实行勤务评定制度”、“反对军国主义教育”。
    夜校的一千名学生今晚也举行大会和游行。
    本报讯　日本岸信介政府为了实行核武装和建立导弹基地，正在各界人民强烈反对下阴谋偷偷地运进大批美国“响尾蛇式”导弹。
    据日本“东京新闻”透露，岸信介政府的“防卫厅”准备采取两种办法。一种是乘反对运进导弹的群众团体的不备，用美军运输机偷偷地运到立川基地等地方。另一种是把“响尾蛇式”导弹同其他美军物资包装在一起用美国军用船运到日本。“东京新闻”说，“防卫厅”已经制订了大量购买美国“响尾蛇式”导弹的计划，并且预定明年2、3月间在本州附近海面上进行发射演习。
    面临着核武装的危险，日本人民正在以反对运进美国“响尾蛇式”导弹为中心同岸信介政府的战争政策进行坚决的斗争。日本共产党、社会党、日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会以及“总评”都一致谴责岸信介政府的核武装计划，并动员各界人民开展广泛的反对运进导弹的运动。日本十个码头工人和海员的工会组织，已开展了拒绝卸运导弹的斗争。
