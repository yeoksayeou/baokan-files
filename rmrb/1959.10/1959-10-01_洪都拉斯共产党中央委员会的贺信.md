To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrades:
    The Communist Party of Honduras warmly congratulates the brotherly Communist Party of China on the tenth anniversary of China's great national democratic revolution—to use Comrade Mao Zedong's formulation in his work "The Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China" in December 1939.
    The Communist Party of Honduras also pays its respects to the working class, farmers, and people of the People's Republic of China.
    The anniversary of the Chinese Revolution is an event of world significance because this great democratic liberation movement has and continues to have popular content, and greatly improves the living conditions of the working masses in this Asian power.
    The experience of the Chinese Revolution is studied with particular attention by the Communist Party of Honduras because the economic and social conditions of our two countries are so similar, and the enemies who oppress and exploit us are also common, namely, US imperialism.
    The Chinese Revolution has promoted and continues to promote the liberation movements of various countries under international imperialist forces. The Chinese Revolution shows how to fight and defeat a formidable enemy who is invincible in the eyes of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thesis that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is increasingly proving to be correct.
    The Communist Party of Honduras is leading the Honduran people, organizing and strengthening the democratic struggle for liberation, and saving the national independence and sovereignty that has been devastated in the face of imperialist interference in our country's economy and all aspects of our lives.
    Every step forward for you, every step forward for your party and your people, is also a decisive support for all peoples oppressed by international imperialism. Every progress of the Chinese Revolution is congratulated and warmly welcomed by our party, because it has a direct effect on eliminating the backwardness and poverty of all the people in the world, who are currently fighting against reactionary forces.
    The works of your leaders are carefully studied by the Communist Party of Honduras. This attitude is by no means accidental, nor is it out of curiosity or other similar reasons. But it is due to the similarity of the conditions in the two countries mentioned above and the fact that the people of our two countries have to deal with a common enemy.
    The Communist Party of Honduras joins the party and people of China in warmly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Chinese Revolution, the tenth anniversary of China's achievement of true national independence and the establishment of the truly sovereign People's Republic of China.
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the Chinese Revolution!
                              The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Honduras
                                        September 25, 1959

### 洪都拉斯共产党中央委员会的贺信

    洪都拉斯共产党中央委员会的贺信中国共产党中央委员会：同志们：
    洪都拉斯共产党向中华人民共和国的兄弟共产党热烈祝贺——用毛泽东同志1939年12月在他的著作“中国革命与中国共产党”里的提法——中国伟大的民族民主革命的十周年纪念。
    洪都拉斯共产党也向中华人民共和国的工人阶级、农民和人民致以敬意。
    中国革命的纪念日是一个有世界意义的事件，因为这个伟大的民主解放运动具有而且仍然具有人民内容，而且大大地改善这一亚洲大国劳动群众的生活条件。
    中国革命的经验受到洪都拉斯共产党特别密切的研究，因为我们两国的经济和社会情况是太相似了，而且压迫和剥削我们的敌人也是共同的，那就是美帝国主义。
    中国革命推动了而且在继续推动国际帝国主义势力下的各个国家的解放运动。中国革命表明了，怎样能够同一个众人心目中打不倒的可畏的敌人作斗争，并且打败他。毛泽东同志关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论点，越来越证明是正确的。
    洪都拉斯共产党在领导洪都拉斯人民，组织和加强争取解放的民主斗争，拯救在帝国主义干涉我国经济和我国生活一切方面的情况下受到蹂躏的民族独立和主权。
    你们的每一步前进，你们党和你们人民的每一步前进，同时也都是对一切受到国际帝国主义压迫的人民的决定性支持。中国革命的每一个进展都受到我们党的祝贺和最热烈的欢迎，因为这对于消灭全世界一切人民的落后和贫困是有直接作用的，他们目前都在为反对反动势力而奋斗。
    你们领袖的著作被洪都拉斯共产党所仔细研读。这种态度绝非偶然，也绝不是出于好奇或其他类似原因。而是由于我们上面所说的两国情况的相似以及我们两国人民都得对付共同的敌人这一点。
    洪都拉斯共产党同中国的党和人民共同热烈庆祝中国革命十周年，庆祝中国获得真正的民族独立、建立具有真正主权的中华人民共和国的十周年。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国革命万岁！
                              洪都拉斯共产党中央委员会
                                        1959年9月25日
