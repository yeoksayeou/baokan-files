　　Review of the Yue Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber"
　　Yi Bing
　　Many plots from "Dream of the Red Chamber" have been adapted for Kunqu Opera, Beijing Opera, and other local operas. However, their fate differs significantly from those adapted from famous novels like "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," and "Journey to the West." Many of the latter's plays, after being refined by generations of artists, have forged immortal artistic charm and still hold an important position in the repertoire of operas. In contrast, plays adapted from the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" have largely become things of the past and are rarely seen on stage today. There are many reasons for this (such as problems with the scripts themselves). Also, the novel centers around the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu, using it as a core from which countless characters and plots are intricately connected like a spider's web. To adapt it into a drama, one must adhere to the rules of drama. There are essentially two approaches: one is to cut out certain plot points and create individual scenes, but the drawback of this method is that audiences only see a branch or segment of "Dream of the Red Chamber" on stage, unable to grasp the whole picture. The second is to remove the extraneous details and establish a main theme, but removing the web connected to the main theme fails to fully embody the profound and grand social content surrounding the love tragedy of Jia and Lin. Therefore, these two methods generally fail to satisfy audiences who love the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber." This reflects the limitations of the dramatic form.

　　Another reason is that the characters in the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" are artistic figures with distinct personalities, vividly depicted. Through the different understanding and imagination of readers, vivid images of Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, Xue Baochai, Xiren, Qingwen, and other characters are engraved in their minds. The artistic images that actors establish on the stage must fundamentally match the images in people's memories. Otherwise, they must have the power to conquer and dispel the images in people's minds, making them sincerely accept the images on stage. What a difficult struggle that is! To win this struggle, actors must not only possess talent but also deeply understand the life in "Dream of the Red Chamber," the relationships between people, the characters' personalities, and the ideological sentiments expressed in the work. They must also provide new interpretations based on new ideological foundations. In short, the actors' understanding of the roles must be no less than that of the audience, and they must strive to exceed them. Otherwise, they cannot convince the audience and complete the creation of the play. This is a difficult problem to deal with when adapting and performing "Dream of the Red Chamber." Past writers and artists, limited by their times, lacked the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism and could not deeply understand the essence of life in the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" or the social reasons for the tragic fate of the protagonists. Therefore, they could not correctly interpret the life, thoughts, and art in the novel. They were at a loss in front of this mirror of the feudal era, as clear as autumn water, and some made incorrect and vulgar interpretations. I believe this is an important reason why many past "Dream of the Red Chamber" plays could not be passed down for a long time.

　　Like many readers who have repeatedly read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," I am afraid of watching "Dream of the Red Chamber" plays, because I fear that the images on stage will damage the images of the characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber" in my mind. This time, due to compelling reasons, I went to see the "Dream of the Red Chamber" performed by the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe. This play focuses on the love tragedy of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu. In addition to including the plot of "Flogging Baoyu," it removes all plot points unrelated to this, making the play very focused and concise. In the first scene, "Daiyu Enters the Mansion," it introduces many important characters in the play, particularly highlighting the melancholy, aloof, and outstanding image of Lin Daiyu, the passionate, sincere, and incompatible with the feudal system Jia Baoyu, and the dignified, wealthy, and doting grandmother Jia. The other characters who appear do not "show off" and do not fulfill the mission of the role according to artistic requirements. The second scene concentrates on two chapters from "Dream of the Red Chamber," namely the eighth chapter, "Jia Baoyu's Accidental Acquaintance with the Golden Lock, Xue Baochai's Coincidental Recognition of the Spiritual Jade," and the nineteenth chapter, "Intimate Moments on a Quiet Day, Jade Exudes Fragrance." The purpose of this scene is to introduce Xue Baochai and cast a shadow of "Golden and Jade Union" between Jia and Lin, in opposition to the beautiful "Wood and Stone Romance" of Jia and Lin, creating conflict. Needless to say, the adaptor's intention is good, and he has every right to change the structure of the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," combining, deleting, or reorganizing it to suit the needs of the drama. However, it is not good to put these two chapters together rigidly, because in the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," Baoyu and Baochai's recognition of the spiritual jade and the golden lock takes place in Baochai's room in Pear Fragrance Court. Baoyu went to see Baochai because she was ill, and their actions were not discovered by Daiyu. If this scene were discovered by her, then how would the suspicious, jealous, and sentimental Lin Daiyu react? In the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," in the chapter "Intimate Moments on a Quiet Day, Jade Exudes Fragrance," Daiyu's mood is like a pool of autumn water, tranquil and clear without ripples. But in this play, Xue Baochai, for some unknown reason, comes to the outer room of Daiyu's bedroom, doesn't go in to see Daiyu, and starts recognizing the spiritual jade and golden lock with Baoyu. Daiyu hides behind the screen and hears everything clearly. How can Daiyu's mood be calm in this situation? But as soon as Xue Baochai leaves, the adaptor wants Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu to act according to the plot described in the chapter "Intimate Moments on a Quiet Day, Jade Exudes Fragrance." It seems that doing so is inconsistent with Lin Daiyu's character and is illogical, harming the beauty and authenticity of these two artistic images to a certain extent.

　　The third scene depicts the scene of Baoyu and Daiyu reading "Romance of the Western Chamber" under the shade of flowers in the Grand View Garden. This scene is handled very appropriately. The actors well embody the noble sentiments and free-spirited personalities of this young couple. They secretly read "Romance of the Western Chamber," intoxicated in the realm of exquisite poetry, revealing their inner secrets implicitly. This scene is full of contradictions in the characters' personalities and full of poetic and picturesque imagery, thus highlighting the charm of the characters' personalities and the charm of art, and beginning to grasp the audience's thoughts and emotions, making them care about the fate of the protagonists' love. The fourth and fifth scenes focus on portraying Jia Baoyu's character, depicting his life in Yi Hong Courtyard. He is a confidant of "actors," maids, and servants, despised and ridiculed by the upper class. He maintains equal and close relationships with them, sympathizing with all the insulted and harmed people - hating secular etiquette and the knowledge of official career and economics. He is unwilling to squeeze into the ranks of bureaucrats and gentry and associate with them. He is a traitor and rebellious son of the feudal ruling class, which sets him in opposition to Xue Baochai, who has orthodox ideas, and makes him a confidant of the aloof and world-weary Lin Daiyu.

　　The scene of Jia Zheng flogging Baoyu begins to centrally expose the cold and brutal essence of the feudal system. Behind Baoyu being severely beaten, Jiang Yuhan, a theatrical actor who broke through the prince's cage and attempted to fly freely, is captured and brought back to the prince's mansion. The feudal system deprives people of their free will and buries them in a tomb-like cold environment. Baoyu's life ideals, enthusiasm, purity, and beautiful character of loving freedom are subjected to the most vicious flogging by his father, the representative of the feudal ruling class. The rebels are tormented and suppressed, which foreshadows the insidious and menacing attack of feudal rule. It wants to seize the freedom and fate of Jia and Lin, and the clouds of tragedy have risen on the stage. In the sixth scene, Lin Daiyu returns from being rebuffed at Yi Hong Courtyard. She has realized the ominous fate of an orphaned girl living under the roof of others because she discovered that Xue Baochai was still in Yi Hong Courtyard late at night, coupled with the talk of the Golden and Jade Union. Daiyu's burying flowers and her burial flower ci is precisely the heart-stirring elegy sung by this ill-fated girl for her own destiny.

　　The seventh scene, combining burying flowers and testing jade, centrally reveals the deep and unswerving love between Jia and Lin, which prepares the conditions for the arrival of the tragedy. The eighth and ninth scenes are adapted according to the ninety-sixth chapter of the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Fengjie Devises a Strange Plan by Concealing the News, Pin'er Loses Her True Nature by Leaking the Secret." The tenth scene, Daiyu Burning Manuscripts, enters the climax of the tragedy. In this scene, the gauze window, bamboo shadows, medicine pot, and lonely lamp make Xiaoxiang Pavilion particularly desolate. Zixuan guards Daiyu. She struggles to sit up from her sickbed, opens the box, and throws the poems one by one into the stove, tearing her heart piece by piece. This outstanding and noble female poet, this orphaned girl who has ideals and enthusiasm for life and love, is buried in the trap set by people who constantly express their affection and love for her. In this last moment, she is accompanied only by a passionate and chivalrous maid, Zixuan.

　　Wang Wenjuan, the actress who plays Lin Daiyu, comparatively delicately creates the character's personality. She develops from the clever, naive, and timid state of a young girl at "Entering the Mansion" to the talented, passionate, and beautiful young woman when reading "Romance of the Western Chamber," and then to showing her sentimental tragic personality in scenes such as "Refused Entry" and "Burying Flowers." In the scene "Daiyu Burning Manuscripts," she sings the heart-stirring line "All kindness and affection end here, only leaving the ruthless fire to bury the poetic soul" with a deep, lingering, and touching "Xianxia Diao," announcing that the beautiful character, talent, and ideals of the feudal era were all brutally destroyed by the era's cannibalistic system. She evokes the audience's deep sorrow and protest, creating a strong tragic effect. In this scene, Meng Liying, the young actress who plays Zixuan, is also a vivid and moving image. She has more than once touched the audience with her passionate and chivalrous character and behavior, making them unable to help but shed tears.

　　Xu Yulan's portrayal of Jia Baoyu also has its successes. From the eleventh scene, "Golden and Jade Union," to the twelfth scene, "Crying at the Coffin," through the deeply painful and indignant "Xianxia Diao," he issues a final accusation against the class to which he belongs, announcing a complete break with this class. He hates those who persecute Lin Daiyu and persecute him, hates the society he is in, so he angrily leaves home and goes away. With the greatest passion, Xu Yulan sings the heart-stirring protest lyrics, singing a funeral song for feudal society, and finally completing the character creation. I think the image of Jia Baoyu created by Xu Yulan is real and profound. In my opinion, this is an important achievement in her artistic creation in recent years.

　　The first two scenes of the Yue Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" are weaker, seeming to be only plot exposition, lacking characterization, and in some places not conforming to the logic of dramatic development and the logic of character behavior. From reading "Romance of the Western Chamber" onwards, although people feel that there are too many scenes and the continuity is insufficient, but generally speaking, this is a better adaptation of "Dream of the Red Chamber" currently. In addition to the above-mentioned roles, only Zhou Baojin's portrayal of the image of Grandmother Jia can give people a vivid image. The other roles are relatively bland, which makes people feel that the overall artistic effect is not enough. But from the overall perspective, this is a successful performance. It basically gives a correct interpretation and a better representation of the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," so it is a welcome artistic creation. (Attached picture)

　　评越剧“红楼梦”
　　伊兵
    “红楼梦”里的许多情节，都曾经被昆曲、京剧和其他地方戏搬上了舞台，但它们的命运和根据“三国演义”、“水浒”、“西游记”等著名小说改编成的戏截然不同，后者的许多剧目经过数代艺术家的千锤百炼，铸出了不朽的艺术魅力，至今还占有戏曲上演剧目中的重要地位；而根据“红楼梦”小说改编的剧目却大都成了明日黄花，今天已经很少在舞台上出现了，这中间原因很多（例如剧本本身的问题），也还因为这部小说以宝玉、黛玉的恋爱悲剧为经，并以它为中心，像蜘蛛结网一样纠结着千丝万缕的人物和情节，要把它改编成为戏剧，就得服从戏剧的规律，办法无非两个：一个是切下其中某些故事情节，编成一折折的戏，这个办法的缺点是人们在舞台上看到的只是“红楼梦”的一枝一节，不能窥其全豹；其二是删去枝蔓，树立主脑，而联系着主脑的蛛网一拆除，又不能充分体现环绕贾、林恋爱悲剧的深刻宏大的社会内容，因此这两个办法一般地不易满足热爱“红楼梦”小说的观众，这里反映了戏剧形式的局限性。
    此外还有一个原因是“红楼梦”小说中的人物形象都是个性鲜明、呼之欲出的艺术形象，这些形象通过读者不同的理解力和想像力，在他们的头脑中刻划了贾宝玉、林黛玉、薛宝钗、袭人、晴雯等人物的活的形象，演员在舞台上树立起来的艺术形象必须基本上符合人们头脑中的形象记忆，要不然就要有力量征服和驱除人们头脑中的形象记忆，使他们心悦诚服地接受舞台上的形象。那是一场多么艰苦的搏斗呀！演员要在这场搏斗中取胜，除了他们必须具有天赋以外，还必须深刻理解“红楼梦”中的生活、人们的相互关系、人物的性格和作品所流露出来的思想情绪，并在新的思想基础上给以新的解释，总之演员对角色的理解程度必须不低于观众，而且要力争超过他们，要不然就无法说服观众，无法完成这出戏的创造。这是个改编演出“红楼梦”戏很难对付的难题。过去的作家、艺术家由于受到他们时代的限制，他们没有马克思列宁主义的思想武器，不可能深刻认识“红楼梦”小说里的生活本质，造成主人翁悲剧命运的社会原因，因此不可能正确地解释“红楼梦”小说里的生活、思想和艺术。他们在这一面明澈似秋水般的封建时代的镜子前面茫然无措，有的则作了错误和庸俗的解释。我以为这是过去许多“红楼梦”戏不能传之久远的重要原因。
    我和许多反复读过“红楼梦”小说的读者一样，怕看“红楼梦”戏，就是怕舞台上的形象损害了我头脑里的“红楼梦”人物的形象。这次由于非看不可的理由，我去看了上海越剧院演出的“红楼梦”。这个剧本以贾宝玉、林黛玉的恋爱悲剧为主，除了还收进“笞宝玉”的情节以外，删去了一切与此无关的故事情节，因此戏很集中简练。它在第一场“黛玉进府”里，介绍了这出戏里的许多重要人物，特别着重地显示了忧郁、孤傲、卓然不群的林黛玉的形象，热情、率真、与封建制度格格不入的贾宝玉的性格和雍容富贵、溺爱孙儿的贾母的形象，其他的出场人物都没有“亮相”，没有按照艺术的要求，完成角色的使命。第二场集中了“红楼梦”中的两回情节，即第八回的“贾宝玉奇缘识金锁，薛宝钗巧合认通灵”和第十九回的“意绵绵静日玉生香”。这场戏的用意在介绍薛宝钗，并在贾、林之间投入一个“金玉良缘”的阴影，以之与贾、林美好的“木石姻缘”相对敌，造成冲突。不用说改编者的意图是好的，他也完全有权改变“红楼梦”小说的结构，加以捻合、删节或者重新组织，使之适合戏剧的要求；但是把这两个回目生硬地接在一起却是不好的，因为在“红楼梦”小说里，宝玉、宝钗认通灵识金锁是在梨香院宝钗的房里，宝玉是为看宝钗的病去的，他们两人的行动也并没有被黛玉所发现，如果这一情景被她发现，那末多疑善妒、多愁善感的林黛玉又将如何？在“红楼梦”小说“意绵绵静日玉生香”一回里，黛玉的情绪似一泓秋水，宁静清澈一无波澜。但在这出戏里，薛宝钗不知何故来到黛玉卧房的外室，也不进去看看黛玉，就和宝玉认通灵识金锁起来，黛玉则躲在屏风后面听得一清二楚，这一来黛玉的情绪又怎么能够宁静呢？可是薛宝钗一走，改编者却要林黛玉和贾宝玉按照“意绵绵静日玉生香”一回中所描写的情节活动，看来这样做是和林黛玉的性格不符的，是不合情理不合逻辑的，它使得这两个艺术形象的美和真实感受到一定的伤害。
    第三场描绘宝玉和黛玉在大观园花荫下读西厢的情景，这一场处理得很合适，演员很好地体现了这一对少男少女高洁的情操和自由不羁的性格，他们偷偷地阅读着“西厢记”，陶醉在绝妙的诗的境界中，含而不露地泄漏着内心的秘密。这一场戏充满了人物性格的矛盾，充满了诗情画意，从而发挥了人物性格的魅力和艺术的魅力，开始掌握了观众的思想情绪，使他们关怀起主人翁爱情的命运。第四、五场集中地刻划了贾宝玉的性格，描绘了他在怡红院中的生活。他是为上流社会所鄙弃所侮弄的“戏子”、婢、仆的知心朋友，他和他们保持着平等和亲切的关系，他同情一切被侮辱被损害的人——憎恶世俗的礼教和仕途经济的学问，他不愿挤到官僚士大夫中间去和他们同流合污，他是封建统治阶级的叛徒逆子，这使他和具有正统观念的薛宝钗的性格对立起来，而和孤高傲世的林黛玉成为知己。
    贾政笞挞宝玉一场，开始集中地暴露了封建制度冷酷和凶暴的本质。在宝玉遭到毒打的背后，一个突破王爷的牢笼，企图自由飞翔的戏曲演员蒋玉函又被抓进王爷府中去了。封建制度剥夺了人们的自由意志，把他们埋葬在坟墓一样阴冷的环境里。宝玉的生活理想、热情、纯洁、爱自由的美好性格遭到封建统治阶级的代表人物、他父亲最狠毒的笞挞。叛逆者受到折磨和压制，这就预示了封建统治无孔不入地、张牙舞爪地袭来，它要攫取贾、林的自由和命运，悲剧的阴云已在舞台上升起。第六场林黛玉从怡红院碰壁回来，她因为发现薛宝钗深夜还在怡红院中，加上金玉良缘之说，她已经意识到寄人篱下的孤女的不祥命运。黛玉葬花和她的葬花辞，正是这位薄命女儿为自己的命运唱出的惊心动魄的挽歌。
    第七场葬花、试玉合在一起，集中地揭示了贾、林山高海深、至死不渝的爱情，这就为悲剧的到来准备了条件，第八、九场是按照“红楼梦”小说第九十六回“瞒消息凤姐设奇谋，泄机关颦儿迷本性”改编的。第十场黛玉焚稿进入了悲剧的高潮，这一场纱窗竹影、药罐孤灯，潇湘馆中分外凄凉，紫鹃守着黛玉，她挣扎着从病榻上坐起来，打开了箱子，把诗稿一篇篇投在火炉里，把自己的心一片一片地撕碎，这位杰出的高洁的女诗人、这位对生活和爱情怀有理想和热情的孤女，就在不断地向她表示亲热、爱抚的人们所设的陷井里被掩埋掉了。在这最后的时刻里伴随着她的只有一个热情侠义的婢女紫鹃。
    饰演林黛玉的演员王文娟同志比较细腻地创造了这个人物的性格，她从“进府”时的聪明、稚嫩、怯弱的小女儿的情态，发展成为读西厢时的才情横溢、热情美丽的少女，到“闭门羹”、“葬花”等场则显示了她的多愁善感的悲剧性格。“黛玉焚稿”一场，她以深沉缠绵、扣人心弦的“弦下调”，唱出了“万般恩情从此绝，只落得无情烈火葬诗魂”这样惊心动魄的句子，宣告了封建时代美好的性格、才华、理想等等都被那个时代吃人的制度粗暴地破坏掉了，她唤起了观众沉痛的感情和抗议的心情，造成了强烈的悲剧效果。在这一场里，青年演员孟莉英扮演的紫鹃，也是一个鲜明的动人的形象，他曾经不止一次地以其热情侠义的性格和行为打动了观众，使他们不禁掉下泪来。
    徐玉兰同志扮演的贾宝玉的形象，也有其成功之处。他从第十一场的“金玉良缘”到十二场“哭灵”时，通过沉痛悲愤的“弦下调”，发出对他所从属的那个阶级的最后的控诉，宣告了和这个阶级的彻底决裂，他痛恨迫害林黛玉、迫害他的一切人，痛恨他所处的社会，因此他愤然离家出走。徐玉兰同志以最大的激情，唱出了惊心动魄的抗议的唱词，为封建社会唱起了丧歌，最后地完成了这个人物的性格创造，我以为徐玉兰同志所创造的贾宝玉的形象是真实和深刻的，在我看来，这是她近年来艺术创造上的一次重要的收获。
    越剧“红楼梦”的剧本前两场较弱，看来只是情节铺叙，缺乏人物性格的刻划，有的地方还不合乎戏剧发展的逻辑和人物行为的逻辑，从读西厢开始，人们虽然感到场次过多，连贯性不足，但从总的说来这是一个目前较好的“红楼梦”的改编本，演出上除了上述几个角色以外，只有周宝金饰演的贾母的形象还能给人鲜明的影象，其他的角色都比较平淡，因此使人觉得艺术上的整体效果还不够。但从总的方面说来这是一次成功的演出。它基本上给予了“红楼梦”小说以正确的解释和较好的表现，因此是一次值得欢迎的艺术创造。（附图片）
