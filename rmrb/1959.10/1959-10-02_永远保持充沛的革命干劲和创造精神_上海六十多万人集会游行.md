Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1st. Shanghai was decorated with lanterns and colorful banners today, with red flags flying everywhere. Over 600,000 people in the city grandly rallied and paraded to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    The celebration ceremony was held in the People's Square in the city center. At 8:00 AM, Chen Yun, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, who is currently in Shanghai, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Mayor of Shanghai, and other Shanghai party and government leaders ascended the reviewing stand. Also on the reviewing stand were all members of the Leningrad delegation headed by Popov, Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU.

    The celebration ceremony began with the solemn national anthem and the sound of celebratory guns. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Mayor of Shanghai, extended festive greetings to the people of the city. He called on the people of the city to unite more closely under the victorious banner of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of diligence, bravery, and perseverance, make persistent efforts, go all out, aim high, overcome all difficulties, and bravely advance towards accelerating the building of our country into a great socialist power.

    The parade began after the celebration ceremony. Leading the way was the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army's Shanghai-based army, navy, and air force units. The Young Pioneers marched forward, jumping and cheering, under the bright sunshine.

    In the vast ranks of the workers, there were countless production charts and product models. There was the second 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator made by the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant a few days ago; the 5,000-ton ocean freighter "Peace No. 58" completed by the Jiangnan Shipyard a week ago; and the 5892A gear grinder, newly produced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, with a precision reaching one sixty-third of a hair's breadth. These demonstrated that Shanghai's industry is rapidly advancing towards high-level, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge development.

    "Always maintain abundant revolutionary drive and creative spirit" is the slogan of the Shanghai working class. In the worker ranks marching forward today were Wang Huaifu, a worker from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant who did twelve years' worth of work in five years; Zhu Shengfang, a worker from the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant who implemented 54 key technological innovation projects in one year; and Lu Yinnan, a worker from the Shanghai Boiler Plant who completed one year and four months' worth of work in eight months. The magnificent steelworker ranks, wearing brand-new work clothes and blue wind and fire goggles, looked extremely imposing.

    Farmers from the outskirts of Shanghai marched forward, carrying huge banners reading "Long Live the People's Communes." "Grain Mountains" made of rice, wheat, barley, and buckwheat appeared in the ranks. Commune members held up rice ears freshly harvested from the bountiful mid-season rice fields, as well as carts of vegetables, models of fat pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks, and enthusiastically cheered as they marched forward.

    A "Happy Mothers and Children" contingent appeared in the parade. Next came the ranks of teachers and students. Twelve thousand energetic young students, carrying huge banners such as "Implement the Party's education policy and improve the quality of teaching," marched and danced past the reviewing stand. The students also brought the results of their participation in productive labor and large-scale scientific research.

    游行队伍中出现了“幸福的母亲和儿童”的队伍。紧接着是学校师生的队伍。一万二千名朝气蓬勃的青年学生，抬着“贯彻党的教育方针，提高教学质量”等巨大标语牌，载歌载舞地走过主席台。学生们还带来了他们参加生产劳动和大搞科学研究的成果。
