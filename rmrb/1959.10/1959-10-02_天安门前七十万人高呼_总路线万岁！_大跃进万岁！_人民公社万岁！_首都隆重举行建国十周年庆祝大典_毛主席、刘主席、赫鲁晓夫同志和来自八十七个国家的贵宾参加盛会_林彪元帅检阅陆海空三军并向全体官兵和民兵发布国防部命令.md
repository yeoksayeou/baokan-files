Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China began at 10:00 a.m. today amidst the deafening sound of salutes and the national anthem. A grand military parade and a mass parade of 700,000 people were held in Tiananmen Square in the capital.

At 9:55 a.m., Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi, together with Comrade Khrushchev, ascended the Tiananmen Gate tower. Standing on the tower with them were other leaders of the Party and the state, including Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, as well as leaders of socialist countries such as Suslov, Ho Chi Minh, Novotny, Kim Il-sung, Tsedenbal, Zawadzki, Dobi, Ganev, Shehu, Matern, and Bodnaras, heads of 60 fraternal party delegations and party representatives, heads of military delegations from Vietnam and Korea, and heads and representatives of government delegations from eight Asian-African friendly countries. At this moment, thunderous cheers erupted in the square, and the band played joyful music. Hundreds of thousands of people shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the solidarity between China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"

Ten years ago today, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, announced the founding of the People's Republic of China on the Tiananmen Gate tower. Ten glorious years have passed, and the heroic motherland has become unprecedentedly prosperous and consolidated. Today, on this great festival, the capital is presented to the people of the motherland with a brand new look. The huge buildings that have sprung up in ten months constitute the magnificent Tiananmen Square. On the east and west sides of the square, which has been expanded two and a half times, are the magnificent Great Hall of the People and the National Museum of Chinese History and the Museum of the Chinese Revolution. Thousands of red flags flutter in the wind, and rows of trees and various styles of street lamps add to the beauty of the magnificent square. Today, 110,000 people are lined up on the 400,000-square-meter square around it, holding bouquets of various colors and forming a huge national emblem and the shapes of 1949-1959 in the field with ingenious formations. Balloons carrying a row of huge slogans and red palace lanterns floated gently in the sky above the square, making Tiananmen Square look very spectacular.

A portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, hangs on the Tiananmen Gate tower. In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes to the south of the square is a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Facing Tiananmen on both sides are portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Two slogan towers with national characteristics are arranged on the left and right sides of Tiananmen. The four sides of the left tower read: "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results!" "Long live the People's Commune!" The four sides of the right tower read: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in a comprehensive and thorough way!" "Long live the Great Leap Forward!"

At 10:00 a.m., Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Mayor of Beijing, announced the start of the capital's celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

At this time, the national anthem was played and a salute was fired. Four hundred Young Pioneers presented flowers to the Monument to the People's Heroes.
