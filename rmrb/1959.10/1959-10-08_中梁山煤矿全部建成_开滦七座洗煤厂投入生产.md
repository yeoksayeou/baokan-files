Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 6th: The North Mine of the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, a mechanized new-type mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal, was officially handed over for production on October 2nd, one year ahead of schedule. By this point, the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, which had been under construction for four years, has been fully completed.

The Zhongliangshan Coal Mine is one of the key projects designed by China with a set quota. The mine is divided into the South and North mines. The South Mine was completed in January this year, eleven months ahead of schedule. Now that the North Mine has been put into production, the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine has become the largest modern coal mine in the Southwest region, with an annual output of 1.8 million tons. The coking coal it produces can be supplied to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company nearby.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 7th: The seven newly built coal washing plants of Kailuan Coal Mine have recently been put into production one after another. According to the design capacity, they can wash and select 4.2 million tons of refined coal annually, supplying the needs of the iron and steel industry.

The production process of these seven coal washing plants, from the entry of raw coal into the plant to the washing of refined coal, loading, and transportation, is fully mechanized. Among them, five are built next to the mine shafts, and the raw coal hoisted from the mine shafts is directly injected into the coal washing machines by belt conveyors.

The employees who undertook the construction of these seven coal washing plants officially started work in March this year. They launched competitions between construction sites and between groups, vigorously carried out rapid construction, successively promoted 27 advanced experiences, and put forward more than 700 rationalization proposals. Therefore, they not only greatly accelerated the construction speed, but also saved the country more than 60,000 yuan in construction funds.

    中梁山煤矿全部建成
    开滦七座洗煤厂投入生产
    据新华社重庆6日电　年产煤炭九十万吨的机械化新型矿井——中梁山煤矿北矿井，提前一年建成在10月2日正式移交生产。至此，前后建设了四年的中梁山煤矿已经全部建成。
    中梁山煤矿是由我国设计的限额以上的重点工程之一。这个矿分南、北两个矿井，南矿井在今年1月建成，比计划提前了十一个月。现在北矿井投入生产以后，中梁山煤矿就成了年产一百八十万吨的目前西南地区最大的现代化煤矿。它所产的炼焦煤，可以就近供应重庆钢铁公司的需要。
    新华社天津7日电　开滦煤矿新建的七座洗选厂在最近先后投入生产。按照设计能力，它们每年能洗选四百二十万吨精煤，供应钢铁工业需要。
    这七座洗选厂的生产过程，从原煤进厂到洗出精煤、装车运输等，完全是机械化的；其中的五座，建设在矿井旁边，矿井提升上来的原煤，由皮带输送机直接注入洗煤机。
    承担这七座洗选厂建设工程的职工们，在今年3月份正式动工以后，开展了工地之间、组与组之间的竞赛，大搞快速施工，先后推广了二十七项先进经验，并且提出了七百多项合理化建议。因此，不仅大大加快了建设速度，而且为国家节省了六万多元的建设资金。
