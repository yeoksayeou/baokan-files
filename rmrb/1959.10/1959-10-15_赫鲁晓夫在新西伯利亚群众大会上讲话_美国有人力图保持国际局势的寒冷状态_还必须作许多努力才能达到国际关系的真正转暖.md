Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 13th: TASS reported that Khrushchev spoke on the 10th at a mass rally of working people in Novosibirsk. Speaking about his visit to the United States, he said that his meetings and conversations with people from all walks of life in the United States showed that most Americans do not want war and are eager to develop peaceful cooperation between our two countries.

Khrushchev said that the achievements of the Soviet Union and the development of the socialist world system are realities that cannot be ignored when resolving international issues. Therefore, the issue of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is a fundamental issue of our time.

Khrushchev said that we should clearly see that the struggle to strengthen peace will be a long-lasting struggle. Peaceful coexistence must be understood correctly. Coexistence is the continuation of the struggle between two social systems, but it is a struggle using peaceful methods, not using war and one country interfering in the internal affairs of another. We believe that this struggle is an economic struggle, a political and ideological struggle, not a military struggle.

Khrushchev continued, this will be a competition between the two systems on a peaceful stage. In order to win this competition, we must make every effort to complete and overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan, further develop the Soviet Union's economy and culture, and strengthen the power of our motherland. Khrushchev pointed out that we Soviet people have everything we need: wisdom, hands, and natural resources. He said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan is based on domestic resources and potential, and this plan can and will be completed and overfulfilled.

Khrushchev pointed out that our meeting and talks with the President of the United States are of great significance for a better understanding of the positions of the two countries and for improving relations between our two countries. When Mr. Eisenhower returns to the Soviet Union, we will continue to hold talks with him. It seems that a summit meeting will be held in the near future. Khrushchev pointed out that all of this creates good conditions for easing international tensions. However, we still have to make many efforts to melt the ice of the "Cold War" and achieve a genuine warming of international relations.

Khrushchev said that we cannot ignore the fact that in the United States and some other Western countries, some people are greatly shocked by the changed temperature in international relations, and have even taken emergency measures to obstruct the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Khrushchev said that they are afraid of the arrival of real warmth, are in a state of panic, and are trying every possible way to keep the international situation cold. Khrushchev pointed out that whoever does not recognize peaceful coexistence intentionally or unintentionally slides to the position of "Cold War" and arms race, and slides to the position of resolving international issues by force rather than through peaceful negotiations.

Khrushchev continued, all the treaties and alliances manufactured by the imperialist countries are disguised as if they are defending against the "communist threat." History proves that this threat does not come from the outside, not from a certain country, but exists within the body of the capitalist countries themselves. Now, the purpose of the various military alliances and groups established by capitalist countries is the same as the purpose of the so-called "Holy Alliance" established by the emperors of the past to suppress revolutionary movements and maintain the throne.

Khrushchev pointed out that the spearhead of the imperialists' military alliances and military blocs is directed against socialist countries and the people of all countries who are striving for democracy and a better arrangement of their lives. The current North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization will inevitably disappear, and they will only leave some unpleasant memories, because the people of all countries can no longer endure the shackles, and they will fight for a better future.

Khrushchev went on to point out that the capitalist countries' aggressive blocs are very afraid of the relaxation of international tensions. They are very afraid that if their own people know the truth about the socialist countries' peace-loving policies, and if they realize that no one is threatening them, then they will rise up against the arms race and the "Cold War," and therefore, these blocs will collapse. These blocs are built under the following intimidation, that is, saying that socialist countries are trying to invade capitalist countries. In fact, the Soviet Union and all socialist countries have never pursued and will never pursue aggressive purposes. On the contrary, we have consistently pursued and will continue to pursue Lenin's policy of peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. It is for this purpose that the Soviet government has put forward the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly. This proposal has been warmly supported by peace-loving people of all countries.

Khrushchev then talked about the Soviet Union's position on the German question and the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a German peace treaty. He said that we advocate negotiations and are willing to point out that if the Western countries really hope to clear the road to friendly relations between our countries, then we must work together to clear the pebbles on this road, and these pebbles are the remnants of the Second World War. They must be swept away from the road, and a German peace treaty must be concluded. We have stated in the past, and we still state now, that we are willing to meet again and are willing to hold negotiations.

　　赫鲁晓夫在新西伯利亚群众大会上讲话
    美国有人力图保持国际局势的寒冷状态
    还必须作许多努力才能达到国际关系的真正转暖
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：赫鲁晓夫10日在新西伯利亚市劳动人民群众大会上讲了话。他在谈到他访问美国的情况时说，他和美国各界人士的会晤和交谈表明，大多数美国人都不希望战争，都渴望发展我们两国的和平合作。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的成就、社会主义世界体系的发展，这是解决国际问题时所不能不考虑到的现实。因此，关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处的问题是当代的根本问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们应该清楚地看到，加强和平的斗争将是持久的。必须正确地理解和平共处。共处就是两个社会制度斗争的继续，不过，是用和平的方法，不是用战争和一国干涉另一国内政的方法进行斗争。我们认为，这种斗争是经济斗争，是政治的和意识形态的斗争，而不是军事斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，这将是两个制度在和平舞台上的竞赛。为了取得这一竞赛的胜利，我们必须尽一切努力来完成和超额完成七年计划，进一步发展苏联的经济和文化，加强我们祖国的威力。赫鲁晓夫指出，我们苏联人无所不备：智慧、双手、自然财富。他说，苏联的七年计划是根据国内的资源和潜力制定的，这个计划一定能够完成和超额完成。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们同美国总统的会晤和会谈对更好地了解两国的立场，对改善我们两国的关系具有重大的意义。当艾森豪威尔先生回访苏联时，我们将继续同他举行会谈。看来，不久的将来将会举行政府首脑会晤。赫鲁晓夫指出，这一切都为缓和国际紧张局势创造了良好的条件。但是，我们还必须作许多努力，才能使“冷战”的冰块融化，才能达到国际关系的真正转暖。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们不能不考虑这样一个事实，即在美国以及西方其他一些国家中，某些人士对国际关系中已经起了变化的温度大为震惊，甚至采取了紧急措施来阻挠苏美两国之间关系的改善。赫鲁晓夫说，他们害怕真正暖和的到来，陷入惊恐万状中，千方百计地使国际的局势保持寒冷状态。赫鲁晓夫指出，谁不承认和平共处，谁就有意或无意地滑到“冷战”和军备竞赛的立场，滑到用武力而不是通过和平谈判方式来解决国际问题的立场。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，帝国主义国家所一手制造的一切条约和联盟都披上这样的伪装：仿佛它们是防御“共产主义威胁”的。历史证实，这种威胁并非来自外部，并非来自某个国家，而是存在于资本主义国家本身的机体之中。现在，资本主义国家建立的种种军事联盟和集团的目的，同昔日那些帝王建立所谓“神圣同盟”以镇压革命运动和维持王位的目的是一样的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义者的军事联盟和军事集团的锋芒是针对着社会主义国家和争取民主、争取更好地安排自己生活的各国人民的。现在的北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织必将消失，它们只会给人留下一些不愉快的回忆而已，因为各国人民不能再忍受镣铐，他们将为争取美好的未来而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，资本主义国家的侵略集团非常害怕国际紧张局势的缓和。他们很害怕，如果他们本国的人民知道了社会主义国家爱好和平政策的真实情况，如果意识到并没有什么人在威胁他们，那末，他们就会起来反对军备竞赛和“冷战”，因此，这些集团将会垮台。这些集团是在下面这样一种恫吓之下建立起来的，即说什么社会主义国家企图侵略资本主义国家。而事实上，苏联、一切社会主义国家过去不会、现在也不会追求侵略目的。相反地，我们过去和将来一贯执行的是列宁的和平和不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。正是为了这种目的，苏联政府才在联合国大会上提出了全面和彻底裁军的建议。这一建议得到了爱好和平的各国人民的热烈支持。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到苏联在德国问题上的立场和苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议。他说，我们主张谈判，并愿意指出，如果西方国家真正希望扫清通向我们各国之间友好关系的道路的话，那末，我们必须共同努力来清除这条道路上的小石子，这些小石子就是第二次世界大战的残余。必须把它们从路上扫除掉，必须缔结对德和约。我们过去声明，现在仍然声明，我们愿意再一次会晤，愿意举行谈判。
