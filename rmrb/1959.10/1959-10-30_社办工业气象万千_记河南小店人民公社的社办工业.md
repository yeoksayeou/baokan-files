    The 社办 Industrial Scene is Thriving
    —A Record of the 社办 Industries of Xiaodian People's Commune, Henan
    Xiaodian People's Commune in Yanjin County, Henan Province, was established in August 1958 through the merger of three advanced agricultural cooperatives: Xiaodian, Fanzhuang, and Dongtun. The commune's original industrial foundation was very weak, consisting of only one ironware cooperative, one pottery cooperative, and one carpentry group, with just over ninety employees. They could only produce small tools, with an annual output value of just over 70,000 yuan, accounting for 5.2% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. After the establishment of the People's Commune, under the correct guidance of the Party Central Committee's policy of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture," the commune-run industries developed rapidly and vigorously. Currently, the entire commune has ninety-eight factories, of which twenty-three, operated by the commune, include mechanical manufacturing and repair, woodworking, construction, flour processing, papermaking, leather, cotton weaving, chemical, fertilizer, winemaking, cotton processing, cement, and printing factories, with five hundred and seventy-seven employees; the seventy-five factories operated by the production brigades, in addition to mechanical repair and fertilizer plants, are mostly factories for the needs of commune members' lives and the processing of agricultural and special local products, with three hundred and seventy-five employees. From January to the end of September this year, the output value totaled 1,485,579 yuan (including 700,2929 yuan for the commune-run factories); according to the characteristics of the booming winter industry, the commune party committee recently revised the planned targets, and by the end of the year, the total output value will reach 3,330,118 yuan, accounting for 36.5% of the total annual industrial and agricultural output value.

    Running Industries That Directly Serve Agriculture
    In commune-run industries, they first paid attention to establishing industries that directly serve agricultural production, such as mechanical repair and fertilizer industries, which played an active role in supporting agricultural production. For example, during the previous deep plowing of land, three hundred and seventy-five iron and wood technicians were organized, five repair stations and twenty-seven mobile groups were set up, thirty-two stoves were lit, and they went deep into two hundred and fourteen production teams to repair and improve 8,223 tools. The task of deep plowing of 55,000 mu of land in the entire commune would have taken fifty-five days to complete at the original speed, but thanks to solving the tool problem, it was completed in only fifteen days, and the depth of plowing also increased from six and a half inches to eight inches to one foot deep. In the campaign to fight drought, protect seedlings and seize the autumn harvest, the workers created twenty-five double-cylinder waterwheels, rushed to make one hundred and twenty-five hand-cranked waterwheels, seventy-eight dragon-bone waterwheels, made eight hundred and fifty-two sluice gates, repaired two hundred and fifty-three waterwheels and five thousand two hundred and fifty small agricultural tools, thereby greatly increasing the speed of irrigation. Commune members deeply felt the benefits of commune-run industries from production, were very happy, and sang:
        The commune's power is infinite
        The flowers of commune-run industry are red
        Not afraid of the sky, not raining
        Tool reform is better than a dragon
        Draw water from the Yellow River for thousands of miles
        Water surges in ten thousand feet deep ditches
        If not for the commune running industry
        How can we break the past and win against nature

    In terms of fertilizer, the twenty-eight fertilizer plants can now produce four kinds of fertilizers, including antibacterial bacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, soil fertilizer, and wasp powder. Soil fertilizer alone produced 8,500 tons, and in the management of autumn fields, 17,000 mu of land were applied with an average of 1,000 jin per mu, eliminating 7,120 mu of third-class seedlings, so the value of the increased production can reach more than 50,000 yuan. The Wangjiazhuang Brigade's 2,100 mu of autumn grain were generally applied with 1,150 jin of soil fertilizer, and the average yield per mu increased from the original 400 jin to 525 jin, and the total output increased from 840,000 jin to 1,100,250 jin. Commune member Wang Jixia composed a song praising: "The People's Commune is really good, it can make its own fertilizer, guarantee a great agricultural harvest, and improve the lives of commune members. A hundred good things, ten thousand good things, can't be said or written enough. Only by working hard can we respond to the good leadership of the Party!"

    In order to tap more labor for agricultural production and meet the needs of commune development and people's lives, the commune and brigades also established flour processing, sewing and shoe factories. The commune used the wastewater discharged from the Meng Jiangnu River to build a flour processing factory, which can drive seven steel mills and produce 18,000 jin of flour per day, freeing up more than 600 laborers to participate in agricultural production. After the entire factory is completed, it can generate 90 horsepower of power and produce 39,000 jin of flour per day. In addition to meeting the needs of 38,000 people in the entire commune for eating flour, it can also process a part for the country. The sewing and shoe factories of the major brigades have a large processing capacity, and the products are more than enough for their own use. The entire commune has forty-two sewing machines, and now 80% of the commune members no longer sew their own clothes.

      Self-Reliance and Starting from Scratch
    One of the characteristics of Xiaodian People's Commune's industrial development is relying on itself, starting from scratch, and equipping light industry based on the means of production industry. For example, almost the entire set of machinery and equipment for the paper mill was manufactured by the commune's machinery factory. Initially, the paper mill needed nearly a hundred kinds of parts such as ancient chucks, lifting machines, and blasting doors. Several times, people were sent to Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, Zhengzhou and other places, but they could not buy them. The workers and cadres worked hard and made their own models and studied the manufacture with the machinery factory workers. As a result, many mechanical parts that could not be bought were successfully manufactured by themselves. According to the design, this factory needs an investment of 60,000 yuan, but in reality, only 10,000 yuan in cash was used, and the remaining 50,000 yuan of equipment and materials were all equipped by the commune's machinery factory.

      Local Materials and Local Processing
    Xiaodian People's Commune has always implemented the policy of combining self-sufficiency production and commodity production. This not only developed commune-run industries and improved the lives of commune members, but more importantly, expanded the commune's public accumulation and consolidated the commune. They seized the production of cotton and sweet potatoes and adopted the policy of using local materials, local processing and utilization, and doing whatever they had. For example, last year, 14,720 jin of soap were processed from the oil mud after oil was extracted from cottonseed, and 20 jin of skin were extracted from every 100 jin of cottonseed before oil extraction. Cottonseed skin was used to process furfural, and finally, 131,625 jin of activated carbon were made from cottonseed skin residue. Several products were produced from cottonseed alone, and the skin residue was not lost at all. The total value reached more than 480,000 yuan, an increase of 5.2 times compared to the past when only oil and cake were extracted, and furfural and activated carbon are also relatively advanced chemical raw materials, and soap is an indispensable commodity for daily use. More than 1,290 jin of sweet potatoes were comprehensively utilized and processed last winter and this spring, and four kinds of products were made, which also increased the value by 1.06 times compared to the original.

    The development of industry in Xiaodian People's Commune has laid a preliminary foundation for realizing the industrialization, mechanization, and electrification of the commune. Now the entire commune has fifteen lathes, a set of papermaking machinery, one hundred and fifty-eight new factory buildings, nine power machines such as boiler-towing machines and gasoline engines, one tractor, one seeder, three threshers, one car, and eight trailers. The funds for purchasing these machines and equipment are all accumulated by commune-run industries. By the end of the year, the commune plans to invest 100,000 yuan in industrial construction and another 50,000 yuan to purchase agricultural machinery. Due to the commune's large-scale industrial development, it has not only increased public accumulation but also increased the income of commune members. This year, the industrial accumulation of Xiaodian People's Commune will reach 390,000 yuan in net profit. The factories operated by the brigade will have 300,000 yuan in profits to be distributed to the commune members, with an average of 1 jiao, 1 fen and 2 li that can be distributed per labor day.

        Six Points of Experience
    What are the main experiences of Xiaodian People's Commune's industry being able to develop and grow rapidly in just over a year?

    First, the secretary takes the lead, and politics takes precedence. This is the basic experience. When starting the industry, the commune party committee seriously studied and implemented the Party's policy of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture," made overall plans, strengthened leadership, included the commune's industry in the work agenda, and studied it regularly. Li Guoju, the first secretary of the party committee, often went deep into the factory to carry out political and ideological education. For example, when the paper mill was first built, it was in the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting. There were no raw materials and a lack of technology, and some cadres poured cold water on it. The commune party committee discovered this problem, educated and encouraged the workers, and gave them strong support. The workers' enthusiasm and determination to overcome difficulties became even greater, and they fought day and night, and the paper mill was completed in less than four months. The party committee regularly studies the problem of running industry, and also assigns a full-time industrial secretary and seven industrial cadres to specifically grasp ideology and production.

    Second, adhere to the policy of serving agricultural production. First, it seized the machinery industry, expanded the original iron and wood industry cooperative, and carried out the manufacture of agricultural tools. Since last year, two machinery factories, five repair stations and twenty-seven repair groups have newly manufactured, modified, and repaired more than 79,000 various agricultural tools, which has strongly supported agricultural production, and trial-produced a large number of new agricultural tools, such as eight-inch plows, weeding hoes, etc. At the same time, establish industries to serve farmers' lives, in order to save labor and promote agricultural production, such as establishing light industries such as water grinding, sewing, and shoe factories. In this way, the development of industry has been actively supported by the broad masses of people, and commune-run industries have taken root and established prestige among the masses.

    Third, continuously rectify and consolidate commune-run industries. After the mass campaign to run industries, factories were established, but due to lack of experience and unsound production management systems, it directly affected the production enthusiasm of workers. The party committee seriously carried out rectification, purified the organization, improved the management system, cadres improved their style, and production greatly increased. Through rectification, the development direction of commune-run industries has also become clearer.

    Fourth, use indigenous methods, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and carry out a great technical revolution. The mass campaign to run industry started with the processing of agricultural products, the comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, and the production of alcohol by indigenous methods. When starting the industry, cadres and the masses had mysterious views and superstitious technology and equipment. The leadership first seized the production of alcohol by indigenous methods, used old jars and wine rivers invested by the masses, and welded the alcohol tower with a part of white iron sheet, and produced alcohol within four days. Then fifteen wineries and four distilleries were built. Facts broke the theory of mystery and kicked off the prelude to large-scale industrial development. Through the great technical reform, chemical raw materials such as furfural and activated carbon were successfully trial-produced by indigenous methods.

    Fifth, adhere to the policy of arming ourselves and expanding reproduction. Thanks to the support and attention of the commune party committee, in the past year or so, in addition to all the profits made by the commune-level industry being invested in industrial production, the commune has also extracted 250,000 yuan to invest in industrial construction, and newly built six factories, including a mechanized paper mill with a daily output of one ton and a water grinding mill, which further expanded the commune-level ownership, which is of great significance for consolidating the people's commune and developing the commune's industrialization.

    Sixth, combine self-sufficiency production and commodity production, and on the premise of serving agricultural production, vigorously engage in commodity production and accumulate funds for commune-run industries.

    In addition to the above experiences, the experience of "two participations and one reform" is also earnestly promoted. Management cadres often go deep into the factory, workshop, and production team to participate in labor operations, which has played a great role in close the relationship between cadres and the masses, boost workers' production enthusiasm, and improve labor productivity.

    社办工业气象万千
    ——记河南小店人民公社的社办工业
    河南省延津县小店人民公社，是在1958年8月间由小店、樊庄、东屯三个高级农业社合并建立的。这个社原来的工业基础很薄弱，仅有铁业社一个，窑业社一个和一个木业组，职工九十多人，只能生产一些小工具，年产值不过七万元，占工农业总产值的5.2％。成立人民公社以后，在党中央“工农业同时并举”方针的正确指导下，社办工业得到迅速猛烈的发展。目前全社共有工厂九十八个，其中属公社经营的有机械制造和修配、木工、营造、面粉加工、造纸、皮革、棉织、化工、化肥、酿酒、棉花加工、水泥、印刷等二十三个工厂，职工五百七十七人；生产大队经营的七十五个厂，除机械修配、化肥厂外，多是为社员生活需要和进行农、土特产品加工的工厂，职工三百七十五人。从今年1月至9月底的统计，产值共达一百四十八万五千五百七十九元（内社营七十万零二千九百二十九元）；按照冬季工业兴旺的特点，最近公社党委重新修订了计划指标，到年底共完成总产值三百三十三万零一百一十八元，占全年工农业总产值的36.5％。办直接为农业服务的工业
    在社办工业中，他们首先注意兴办直接服务于农业生产的工业，如机械修配、化肥等工业，对农业生产起了积极的支援作用。如在前段深翻土地中，曾组织铁木技工三百七十五人，设立五个修配站，二十七个流动组，生起三十二盘烘炉，深入到二百一十四个生产小队，整修改进工具八千二百二十三件。全社五万五千亩翻地任务，按原来速度需要五十五天才能结束，由于解决了工具问题，只用十五天就完成了，而且翻地深度也由六寸半增长至八寸到一尺深。在抗旱保苗夺取秋季丰收运动中，工人们创制了双筒水车二十五部，赶制手摇式水车一百二十五部，龙骨水车七十八部，制闸门八百五十二个，修配水车二百五十三部和小件农具五千二百五十件，从而大大提高了浇地速度。社员们从生产中深深感到社办工业的好处，非常高兴，歌唱道：
        公社力量大无穷
        社办工业鲜花红
        不怕天高不下雨
        工具改革胜蛟龙
        千里引夺黄河水
        万丈深沟水浪涌
        不是公社办工业
        那能破古把天赢
    在肥料方面，二十八个化肥厂目前已能生产抗生菌、固氮菌、土化肥、蛤蜂粉等四种肥料。仅土化肥一项就生产了八千五百吨，在秋田管理中，有一万七千亩地每亩平均施入一千斤，消灭了七千一百二十亩三类苗，因此增产的价值可达到五万多元。大王庄大队二千一百亩秋粮，普施土化肥一千一百五十斤，每亩平均由原单产四百斤增长为五百二十五斤，总产由八十四万斤增长到一百一十万零二千五百斤。社员王继夏编了个歌子称颂说：“人民公社真正好，自己能把化肥造，保证农业大丰收，社员生活能提高，百个好，万个好，说不完也写不了，只有大家加劲搞，回答党的好领导！”
    为了挖掘更多的劳动力投入农业生产，适应于公社发展和人民生活的需要，公社和大队还建立了面粉加工、缝纫和鞋厂。公社利用孟姜女河排出的废水建成了面粉加工厂一座，可以带动七盘钢磨，日产面粉一万八千斤，腾出六百多名劳动力参加农业生产。整个厂建成后，可以发出九十马力的动力，日产面粉三万九千斤，除满足全社三万八千人吃面需要外，还能给国家加工一部分。各大队的缝纫和鞋厂的加工能力很大，产品除自用还有余。全社拥有四十二部缝纫机，现在已有80％的社员不再自己缝衣裳了。
      自力更生白手起家
    小店人民公社办工业的特点之一是依靠自己，白手起家，以生产资料工业为基础装备轻工业。如造纸厂几乎整套机器设备都是由公社的机械厂制造出来的。最初，造纸厂需要叨古卡盘、起落机、爆门等近百种零件，几次派人到新乡、焦作、郑州等地都买不到，工人和干部就苦钻苦练，自己制了模型与机械厂职工研究制造，结果好些买不到的机械零件，自己制造成功了。这个厂按设计需投资六万元，实际只用了一万元现金，其余五万元的设备物资全是由公社机械厂装备起来的。
      就地取材就地加工
    小店人民公社始终贯彻执行了自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，这样不仅发展了社办工业，改善了社员生活，更重要的是扩大了公社的公共积累，巩固了公社。他们抓住棉花和红芋两项生产做文章，采取就地取材、就地加工利用，有啥办啥的方针，大搞综合利用。如去年利用棉籽榨油后的油泥加工成肥皂一万四千七百二十斤，未榨油前每百斤棉籽克出二十斤皮，利用棉籽皮加工成糠醛，最后利用棉皮渣制成活性炭十三万一千六百二十五斤，仅棉籽一项即出几种产品，皮渣一点不丢，总价值达四十八万多元，较过去只榨油出饼提高价值五点二倍，而且糠醛、活性炭又是较高级的化工原料，肥皂又是日用不可缺少的商品。去冬今春综合利用加工的一千二百九十多斤红芋，制出四种产品，也较原来提高价值一点零六倍。
    小店人民公社由于工业的发展，给实现公社工业化、机械化、电气化奠定了初步基础。现在全社已有车床十五部，造纸机械一套，新厂房一百五十八间，有锅驼机、汽油机等动力机器九部，拖拉机一台，播种机一部，脱谷机三部，汽车一部，拖车八部，这些机器设备的购置用款都是社办工业的积累。到年底，公社计划拿出十万元投资于工业建设方面，并计划再拿五万元购买农业机械。由于公社大办工业，不仅增加了公共积累，而且增加了社员收入。今年小店人民公社工业积累，纯利润将达三十九万元，大队经营的工厂，将有三十万元利润分配给社员，平均每个劳动日可以分到一角一分二厘。
        六点经验
    小店人民公社工业在短短的一年多的时间内能够迅速发展壮大，他们的主要经验是什么呢？
    第一，书记挂帅，政治领先，这是基本经验。开始办工业的时候，公社党委就认真地研究并且贯彻执行了党的“工农业同时并举”的方针，全面规划，加强领导，把公社工业列入工作日程，定期研究。党委第一书记李国举同志经常深入到厂，进行政治思想教育工作。如纸厂初建时，正处在夏收夏种繁忙季节，既无原料又缺乏技术，有的干部就泼冷水。公社党委发现了这一问题，对工人进行了教育鼓励和大力支持，工人们的干劲和克服困难的决心更大了，昼夜奋战，不到四个月就建成了纸厂。党委定期研究办工业问题，还配备专职工业书记和七名工业干部，具体抓思想和生产。
    第二，坚持为农业生产服务的方针。首先抓住了机械工业，扩建了原有的铁木业社，进行农具的制造工作。自去年以来，两个机器厂、五个修配站和二十七个修配小组，新制、改制、修配各种农具七万九千多件，有力地支援了农业生产，并试制了大量的新式农具，如八寸步犁、耘锄等。同时，建立为农民生活服务的工业，以节余劳力，促进农业生产，如建立水打磨、缝纫、鞋厂等轻工业。这样，工业的发展，得到了广大群众的积极支持，社办工业在群众中扎下了根，树立了威信。
    第三，不断地对社办工业进行整顿巩固。经过全民性的大办工业运动，工厂建立起来了，但由于缺乏经验，生产管理制度不健全，直接影响着工人的生产积极性。党委认真地进行了整顿，纯洁了组织，健全了管理制度，干部改进了作风，生产有了很大提高。通过整顿，也更加明确了社办工业的发展方向。
    第四，土法上马，土洋结合，大闹技术革命。全民性的大办工业首先是从农产品加工、红芋综合利用、土法生产酒精开始的。开始办工业，干部和群众都存在着神秘观点，迷信技术设备等。领导上首先抓住土法生产酒精，利用群众投资的旧缸、酒川，用了一部分白铁皮焊成了酒精塔，四天内就生产出了酒精。接着建酒厂十五处，酒精厂四处，用事实打破了神秘论，揭开了大办工业的序幕，并通过大闹技术改革，用土法试制成功了糠醛、活性炭等化工原料。
    第五，坚持自己武装自己，扩大再生产的方针。由于公社党委的支持和重视，一年多来，除公社一级工业所取得的利润全部投入工业生产以外，公社又抽出二十五万元投资于工业建设，新建了日产一吨的机制纸厂、水打磨厂等六个工厂，进一步扩大了公社一级所有制，对巩固人民公社、发展公社工业化具有重大意义。
    第六，自给性生产和商品性生产并举，在为农业生产服务的前提下，大搞商品性生产，积累了社办工业资金。
    除上述经验外，还认真推行“两参一改”的经验，管理干部经常深入到厂、车间、生产小组参加劳动操作，这对密切干群关系、鼓舞工人的生产积极性和提高劳动生产率，都起了很大的作用。
