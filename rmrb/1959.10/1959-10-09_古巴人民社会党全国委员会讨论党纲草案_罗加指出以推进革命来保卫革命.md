Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 7th - The National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party held a meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. The agenda of the meeting was: 1. Regarding the party program; 2. Issues of the trade union movement; 3. Regarding the organizational situation of the party. Currently, the meeting is discussing the first item on the agenda—the draft revision of the party program.
　　
Participating in the plenary session were delegations from fraternal parties of some Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Venezuela.
　　
Juan Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, pointed out in his opening speech that this plenary session "is being held under the distinct characteristics of the domestic and international situation." The characteristic of the domestic situation is: "Our country is undergoing a tense and profound revolutionary process, which is the aspiration and hope of our Latin American brothers;" on the international front, "there are two consistent basic facts: the easing of international tensions and the growth and strength of the socialist camp headed by the great, glorious, and beloved Soviet Union, the object of universal aspiration."
　　
Blas Roca, the party's General Secretary, delivered a report on the draft revision of the party program at the first day's meeting. In explaining the draft, he pointed out that "the January Revolution signifies a qualitative change in the Cuban situation," "some clauses in our program of democracy and national liberation have been realized," and "the rest are being realized." He said, "In the past, the starting point of our program was: the main and most urgent demand at the time was to overthrow the pro-imperialist tyranny and to propose a constitutional government of a broad people's united revolutionary front, which would begin to thoroughly resolve the Cuban crisis. Now the starting point of our program is: there exists a revolutionary regime headed by Fidel Castro, which demands national sovereignty and has begun to realize the historical goals of this revolutionary stage. In the past, the starting point was 'overthrow the pro-imperialist tyranny,' while now the starting point is 'defend the revolution by advancing the revolution.' In the past and now, our basic goals are the same: everything for the complete victory of the revolution."
　　
Roca pointed out: "Conditions exist for the Cuban revolution to achieve complete victory." He also said, however, that "there are also unfavorable conditions, which should be calmly recognized and analyzed in order to be overcome." Roca condemned attempts to exaggerate the unfavorable conditions for the revolution and to spread defeatist sentiments.
　　
He said, "Whether the revolution achieves complete victory, fails halfway, suffers defeat, or encounters temporary setbacks basically depends on the attitude of the various revolutionary forces, their actions, and the degree of their unity and cooperation." He said, "The difficulties of the Cuban revolution are enormous." The proximity of imperialism and the imperialist lackeys like Trujillo and Somoza are undoubtedly a threat; however, "careful consideration should be given to what forces to rely on and how to defeat this threat." Roca pointed out that "the draft program clearly indicates that the forces by which the Cuban revolution can overcome this threat are: 1. The support of the Cuban people; 2. The enthusiastic sympathy of the Latin American people; 3. The understanding of the American people; 4. The active sympathy and willingness of the Soviet Union, China, other socialist countries, and the Asian and African countries that have recently freed themselves from imperialist rule to provide us with assistance." Roca said that due to "the balance of world forces, the attitude of Latin American public opinion, and the prevailing situation in Cuba," it is now more difficult for imperialism to take open interventionist actions as it did in Guatemala.
　　
He emphasized that as long as the Cuban revolution is not subdued by the fear and wavering of the bourgeoisie, the Cuban revolution can and should achieve victory.
　　
In explaining the draft program, Roca emphasized that the Cuban revolution is in a continuous process of development through various stages. In the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, with the participation of the proletariat, or rather, under the leadership of the proletariat, measures have already been taken to prepare for the next stage. In the socialist revolution stage, all the tasks that should be completed will be completed. This does not mean that it is possible to rashly enter the socialist revolution stage in Cuba, or that this transformation is very close.
　　
Roca said that the bourgeoisie's fear of the proletariat and socialism is a factor used by imperialism to oppose the revolution. Roca said, "We cannot eliminate this fear of the bourgeoisie by concealing our socialist ideas." Roca emphasized that this fear of the bourgeoisie should disappear, because this will cause the bourgeoisie to suffer defeat and to meet a more miserable end.
　　
Roca said that the development process of socialism is inevitable. "We have studied various conditions in the draft program, which will make the victory of socialism in Cuba possible." Roca pointed out, "At the same time, we must deepen our belief in socialism, more forcefully and resolutely support the current stage of the revolution, and more forcefully and resolutely support the revolutionary regime and its leader Fidel Castro."

    古巴人民社会党全国委员会讨论党纲草案
    罗加指出以推进革命来保卫革命
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　古巴人民社会党全国委员会6日下午举行会议，会议的议程是：一、关于党的纲领；二、工会运动问题；三、关于党的组织情况。目前会议正在进行关于第一项议程——即关于修改党纲的草案的讨论。
    参加全会的有拉丁美洲一些国家兄弟党的代表团，其中有阿根廷、巴西、智利、危地马拉、尼加拉瓜、多米尼加共和国、萨尔瓦多和委内瑞拉。
    古巴人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略在致开幕词时指出，这次全会“是在国内外形势具有鲜明特点的情况下召开的”，国内形势的特点是：“我国正经历着紧张而深刻的革命过程，这是我们拉丁美洲的兄弟人民的憧憬和希望”；在国际方面，“有两个一致的基本事实：国际紧张局势的缓和，以及以伟大而光荣的敬爱的苏联为首的、众所向往的社会主义阵营的发展壮大”。
    党的总书记布拉斯·罗加在第一天的会议上作了关于修改党纲的草案的报告。他在阐述草案时指出，“一月的革命意味着古巴形势中质的变化”，“我们纲领中民主和民族解放的某些条款已经实现了”，“其余的正在实现”。他说，“过去我们的纲领的出发点是：当时主要的和最迫切的要求是推翻亲帝的暴政，是提出广泛的人民联合革命政府的宪法，这个政府应开始彻底地解决古巴危机，现在我们的纲领的出发点是：存在着一个以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的革命政权，这个政府要求民族主权，已经开始实现这一革命阶段的历史目标。过去的出发点是‘推翻亲帝暴政’，而现在的出发点是‘以推进革命来保卫革命’。过去和现在我们的基本目的都是一样的：一切为了取得革命的完全胜利。”
    罗加指出：“存在着使古巴革命可以取得完全胜利的条件。”他又说，但是“也有不利条件，对这些不利条件应该冷静地认识和分析，以便能够克服它们。”罗加谴责有人企图夸大对于革命的不利条件，散布失败主义情绪。
    他说，“革命是取得完全胜利，还是半途而废，遭受失败，或受到暂时的挫折，这基本上取决于各派革命力量的态度，他们的行动和团结合作的程度。”他说，“古巴革命的困难是巨大的。”邻近帝国主义及特鲁希略、索摩查等帝国主义的走狗无疑是一种威胁；但是，“应该仔细考虑依靠什么力量和怎样才能够战胜这种威胁。”罗加指出，“纲领草案明确地指出了古巴革命借以战胜这一威胁的力量是：一、古巴人民的支持；二、拉丁美洲人民热烈的同情；三、美国人民的了解；四、苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家以及最近摆脱帝国主义统治的亚非各国的积极同情和准备给我们的援助。”罗加说，由于“世界力量的对比，拉丁美洲舆论的态度，和在古巴占统治地位的形势”，现在帝国主义要像对危地马拉一样采取公开干涉的行动是更加困难了。
    他强调说，只要古巴革命不为资产阶级的恐惧和动摇所折服，古巴革命就能够而且应该取得胜利。
    在纲领草案的说明中，罗加强调指出，古巴革命是处在各阶段不断发展的过程中，在有无产阶级参加，或者说是无产阶级领导的资产阶级民主革命阶段中，已经有了为下一阶段做好准备的措施。在社会主义革命阶段将完成一切它应该完成的任务。这并不是说，在古巴可以鲁莽地转入社会主义革命阶段，或者是这一转化已经很接近了。
    罗加说，资产阶级对无产阶级和社会主义的恐惧是帝国主义用来反对革命的一个因素。罗加说，“我们不能用隐蔽我们的社会主义思想的办法，来消除资产阶级的这种恐惧。”罗加强调指出，资产阶级的这种恐惧应该消失，因为这会使资产阶级遭受失败，并且使它遭到更加悲惨的灭亡。
    罗加说，社会主义的发展过程是不可避免的。“我们在纲领草案中研究了各种条件，这些条件将使古巴的社会主义可能获得胜利。”罗加指出，“而同时我们要更加深对社会主义的信念，更有力和坚决地支持现阶段的革命，更有力和坚决地支持革命政权及其领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗。”
