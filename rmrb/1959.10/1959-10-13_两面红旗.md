Two Red Flags
　　Liu Yaoli　Zhu Defan

　　In the bustling labor competition at the Limin Iron Factory in Chaling, Hunan, a moving story of the advanced helping the backward to catch up recently occurred.

　　An Unexpected Challenge

　　Among the eight small blast furnaces in this iron factory, two were the most famous: the most advanced No. 4 furnace and the previously most backward No. 7 furnace. The volume of No. 4 furnace was only seven cubic meters, while No. 7 furnace had 10.6 cubic meters. Logically, the daily output of No. 7 furnace should have been higher than that of No. 4 furnace, but on the daily production reports, the output, quality, coke ratio, and utilization coefficient of No. 4 furnace always led by a large margin.

　　Were the production conditions of No. 4 furnace particularly good? No. It was built during the Great Leap Forward of Steel Production last year using waste refractory bricks, waste hot air pipes, and other materials. It consumed the leftover crushed ore, low-quality coke, and anthracite coal from the large furnaces. Therefore, people called it the "three-waste furnace." However, the thirty-eight workers in the entire furnace did not resign themselves to being inferior. They displayed soaring enthusiasm, worked hard and cleverly, and in the ten months since the furnace started operating, its utilization coefficient had consistently remained around 1.7. It was constantly praised by the higher-level Party committee, and people changed its name to the "hero furnace."

　　The workers of this furnace were not satisfied with their achievements. In order to promote the great leap forward in production throughout the factory, they decided to first promote and help the most backward No. 7 furnace catch up with them.

　　One day, a challenge letter from No. 4 furnace appeared on the wall of No. 7 furnace. The competition conditions written on it were: daily iron production of 14 tons, 100% qualification rate, coke ratio of 1:0.98...

　　This unexpected challenge letter brought a huge shock to the workers of No. 7 furnace. Most people were overjoyed and prepared to have a great battle with No. 4 furnace; but a few people were afraid of not being able to beat No. 4 furnace. Some people from other furnaces were also sweating for No. 7 furnace.

　　The factory Party committee grasped the leadership of this competition. The Party committee organized the workers of No. 7 furnace to hold an emergency field meeting. By recalling the battle process of No. 4 furnace and analyzing their own favorable conditions (better equipment than No. 4 furnace), they established their confidence in winning.

　　Opponent or Helper?

　　The heated competition unfolded.

　　The furnace front workers strengthened the maintenance of the slag and iron outlets, and the furnace top workers charged the materials in a timely manner, achieving uniform and qualified proportions... In less than a few days, the daily output of No. 7 furnace increased from nine tons to twelve tons, fourteen tons, and reached a maximum of sixteen tons.

　　At the same time, the workers of No. 4 furnace also mustered greater enthusiasm, worked hard and cleverly, and their daily output increased from ten tons to twelve tons, fourteen tons...

　　Just as the two furnaces were competing fiercely and the utilization coefficient of No. 7 furnace was about to catch up with No. 4 furnace, No. 7 furnace experienced a malfunction with air leakage from the iron and slag outlets, and the output began to decline.

　　After the furnace leader of No. 4 furnace, Hong Liyin, learned about this, he immediately dispatched Zhu Buyun and Li Fangrun, the two most outstanding furnace front workers, to support No. 7 furnace.

　　After ten days of intense competition, No. 7 furnace finally changed its backward situation rapidly with the help of No. 4 furnace. Except for the utilization coefficient, which did not catch up with No. 4 furnace, all other indicators exceeded No. 4 furnace, and it won the red flag. The workers of No. 4 furnace also received a high honor for this. The workers in the smelting workshop all said: No. 4 furnace also got a red flag, and what they got was the red flag of communist ideology.

　　两面红旗

    在湖南茶陵利民铁厂热火朝天的劳动竞赛中，不久前发生了一桩先进帮助落后赶上自己的动人故事。
    意外的战表
    这个铁厂的八座小高炉中，有两个最著名，这就是最先进的四号炉和以前最落后的七号炉。四号炉的容积只有七立方米，七号炉有十点六立方米。按理，七号炉的日产量应该比四号炉多，可是在每天的生产日报表上，四号炉的产量、质量、焦比、利用系数总是遥遥领先。
    四号炉的生产条件是不是特别好呢？不。它是在去年大炼钢铁期间用废耐火砖、废热风管等材料建成的。它吃的是大炉子剩下的碎矿石，低质焦炭和白煤。因此，人们叫它“三废炉”。全炉三十八个工人却没有因此而甘居下游。他们发挥了冲天的干劲，苦干加巧干，使这座“三废炉”在开炉以后的十个多月里，利用系数一直保持在一点七左右，不断地受到上级党委的表扬，人们便改称它为“英雄炉”了。
    这座炉的职工并不满足于自己取得的成绩，为了推动全厂生产大跃进，他们决定首先促进和帮助全厂最落后的七号炉赶上自己。
    一天，在七号炉的炉壁上，出现了四号炉发出的一份战表。上面写的竞赛条件是，每天产铁十四吨，合格率达100％，焦比一比零点九八……。
    这份意外的战表，给七号炉的工人带来了巨大的震动。大部分人欢欣鼓舞，准备和四号炉大战一场；但也有少数人怕赛不过四号炉。别的炉子上的人，有的也为七号炉捏着一把汗。
    厂党委抓紧领导了这一竞赛。党委组织七号炉的职工开了紧急战地会，通过回忆四号炉的战斗过程，分析自己的有利条件（设备比四号炉好），树立了必胜的信心。
    是对手是帮手
    热烈的竞赛展开了。
    炉前工加强了渣、铁口的维护工作，炉顶工及时下料，做到了比例均匀合格……不到几天，七号炉的日产量便由九吨提高到十二吨、十四吨，最高达到了十六吨。
    与此同时，四号炉工人也鼓足更大干劲，苦干巧干，日产量由十吨上升到十二吨、十四吨……。
    正当两个炉子赛得难解难分，七号炉的利用系数快要赶上四号炉的时候，七号炉却发生了铁、渣口放风的故障，产量开始下降。
    四号炉的炉长洪立银知道这件事情以后，立即抽出朱步云、李芳润两个最优秀的炉前工到七号炉去支援。
    经过十天紧张的竞赛，七号炉终于在四号炉的帮助下，迅速改变了落后状况，除利用系数一项没有赶上四号炉外，其他指标都超过了四号炉，夺得了红旗。四号炉的工人因此也获得了崇高的荣誉。冶炼车间的工人们都说：四号炉也得了红旗，他们得的是共产主义思想的红旗。
