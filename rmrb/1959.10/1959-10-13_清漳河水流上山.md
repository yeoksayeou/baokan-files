The Clear Zhang River Water Flows Uphill

　　Climbing to the Sacred Buddha Ridge, over 3,000 meters above sea level, and looking into the distance, the Zhangbei Main Canal of She County, winding along the mountainside of the Taihang Mountains, resembles a silver dragon soaring through the air. The Zhang River water flows through mountains and valleys, cascading down and extending into the northern basin of She County. On the tens of thousands of acres of terraced fields, layer upon layer, are fields of snow-white cotton, oily black corn, and golden yellow millet, wave after wave, sending out a prediction of a bumper harvest to the people. Flocks of sheep graze on the hillsides, cowbells jingle in the valleys, and cars race on the roads below. The songs of the shepherd boys, the laughter of the women washing clothes along the canal, and the songs of the construction workers building the hydroelectric power station all combine to create a harmonious melody. What a charming scene of a socialist mountainous area!

    Recalling the Past

　　This beautiful picture was drawn by the working people during the Great Leap Forward and after the communization, with their own hands. In the past, the northern basin of She County was a place associated with drought and poverty. The mountains were barren, and it was difficult to get water for irrigation, let alone drinking water. Many families practiced "multiple use of water": first washing vegetables, then washing dishes, then washing clothes, and even finally using it for livestock. Drought forced people to travel over mountains and ridges year after year, carrying water from dozens of miles away. People couldn't even get enough water to drink, so how could they irrigate their fields? They could only watch helplessly as the crops withered. Disputes over water, lawsuits, and even armed conflicts between villages continued for countless generations; for water, how many families were broken up, how many people died or left their homes; for water, how many young men could not find wives and remained bachelors for life. In the past, a ballad circulated in the northern basin of She County: "Don't marry your daughter to Xigang Village, the thought of getting water breaks your heart, carrying water from more than ten miles away, scolding the matchmaker as you carry the water bucket."

　　In the past, the people here both longed for and feared water. Not far from these mountain villages, the Clear Zhang River flowed day and night, but the abundant water resources did not benefit the people. The ruthless oppression of rulers of past dynasties forced the vast number of poor peasants to open up wasteland on steep slopes; coupled with indiscriminate felling of trees and disrepair of terraced fields, severe soil erosion resulted. During the rainy season, torrential rains would fall, mountain floods would erupt, and countless gullies and fields would be destroyed. Alternating between drought and flood, the people lived in dire poverty. A ballad sang: "The Taihang Clear Zhang is high and long, poor mountains and bad waters yield no grain, poverty forces people to sell their children, not enough bran and vegetables for half a year's food."

    Water Uphill

　　After liberation, the peasants of the Zhang River, in order to drive away poverty, under the leadership of the Party, have been fighting drought. In recent years, they have opened mountains and split rocks, building tens of thousands of water storage ponds and cellars. But these could not fundamentally change the face of the mountainous area. In the event of a severe drought, the ponds and cellars would dry up completely, and solving the water problem remained the most pressing need for the peasants.

　　1958 was an extraordinary year. The call for the Great Leap Forward resounded throughout the country. Leap forward! Leap forward! It was like a huge torrent of heat, injected into the heart of everyone in She County, turning into endless power. In order to lead the peasants to forever get rid of the threat of drought, the She County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "Eliminate drought and bring water uphill," and made a resolution to draw the Zhang River water from the source, open a Zhangbei Main Canal around the Taihang Mountains, and transform 90,000 mu of dry terraced fields into irrigated land, fundamentally changing the drought-stricken face of the mountainous area. According to this resolution, a plan was drawn up to divert the Xia Qingquan water (i.e., the Zhang River water) from Licheng County, Shanxi Province, to the northern basin of She County, which is 160 meters higher than the riverbed. The canal would meander for more than 180 li along the mountainside of the Taihang Mountains, crossing hundreds of gullies and ridges, passing through the precipitous cliffs known as the Broken Head Cliff, West Cliff Head, Tiger Head, Phoenix Mountain, and Sacred Buddha Ridge, digging 65 earth and stone tunnels, totaling 7,373 meters in length, and building 274 flood crossing bridges, sluice gates, bridge culverts, and overflow dams. Because this grand plan directly reflected the urgent needs of the masses, it was quickly and firmly supported by the people of the county. The peasants regarded the county committee's resolution as a mobilization order to march on nature, a mobilization order for the socialist Great Leap Forward. Many Party members and League members wrote letters of determination, and many commune members repeatedly requested to go to the most dangerous construction sites. Peasants from 200 villages across the county took action. The heroes who declared war on nature, carrying shovels and pickaxes, carrying baskets, and yoking livestock, rushed to the Zhangbei Main Canal construction site from all directions like soldiers on an expedition. Villages that did not directly benefit also came to assist the benefiting villages, and the spirit of great cooperation spread throughout the county.

　　The slogan "Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, transform nature, and build a socialist main canal" resounded through the sky. Niu Shui Niu, an old migrant worker from the Xida Commune, which did not directly benefit, posted a big-character poster on the first day of the canal opening: "For the happiness of our mountainous area's future generations, I want to work with everyone to resolutely do it to the end!" It was precisely this determination and this spirit of communism that encouraged people to overcome all difficulties. Without lime, they burned it themselves; without gunpowder, they made it themselves; they brought their own food, clothing, and tools; if the tools broke, they repaired them themselves; if they didn't have money to buy wood, everyone contributed. Tian Jiaxiang, an old man from Guxin Village, sold his coffin board that he had prepared as an investment. The village cadres were reluctant, but he said anxiously: "With the canal, I can live a few more years, what's the use of keeping it now!" The masses of the county raised more than 2 million yuan in just a few days.

　　On January 5, 1958, the Zhangbei Main Canal began construction. The heroes who opened the canal in Xia Qingquan canal mouth, Licheng, Shanxi, cut stone mountains, split forests, repaired over two li of road, and had just entered She County when they encountered a Broken Head Cliff that had no sidewalk, only a place for birds to perch. The cliff was thirty-odd feet high, steep and straight, and at the foot of the cliff was a large water pool several feet deep. Since ancient times, few people had passed this way. There was a saying among the masses: "Rather go a hundred li out of the way than pass the 'Broken Head Cliff.'" But according to the engineering plan, the canal had to pass through the middle of the cliff. This was the first difficulty encountered in opening the canal and the first test for the people. Faced with this arduous and dangerous project, the heroic people issued a bold statement: "Since ancient times, there has been only one road to Mount Hua, and the People's Liberation Army has opened a second road. If there is no road on this mountain, we will open it up!" Yang Kunnan, deputy commander of the First Combat Regiment, and four young men, Yang Limao, Yang Maoyuan, Cheng Jinting, and Cheng Quanting, stepped forward and expressed to the Party: "Not afraid of danger, determined to open the 'Broken Head Cliff.'" They formed a "suicide squad," grabbed a sledgehammer in one hand and a steel drill in the other, and climbed up the steep cliff. Yang Kunnan climbed at the front, he clenched his teeth and climbed up to the middle of the mountain, fifteen feet high, in one go. Then, thirty shock team members climbed up one after another. Unable to stand firm on the mountainside and unable to swing their hammers, they tied a rope around each person's waist and drilled holes in the cliff face in mid-air. The only road was blocked by rubble, so they built more than fifty meters of rope ladders, forty meters of cloud ladders, and more than eighty meters of sky bridges, and launched a full-scale attack in the middle of the "Broken Head Cliff." They first cut the steep wall into a flat surface, and then opened the canal downward. After more than eight months of fighting, they dug a 350-meter-long mountainside canal; at the same time, they drilled a 165-meter-long tunnel through the protrusion of the "Broken Head Cliff." The "Broken Head Cliff" bowed to the heroes. To commemorate this heroic battle, people carved the bold declaration "Zhang River moved uphill, drilling at both ends of the Broken Cliff, blocking the Zhang River water, cutting off the Taihang Mountains, determined to compete with the atomic bomb, not afraid of engineering difficulties" on the red cliff board of the "Broken Head Cliff."

　　In August, the people's commune was born again in this season of harvest. This organization with unparalleled vitality, just born, promoted the rapid development of various rural undertakings. The Zhangbei Main Canal project progressed more rapidly due to the commune's advantages of large organizational scale, wide scope of activity, and the ability to fully mobilize and rationally arrange labor. The heroes who repaired the canal worked with soaring enthusiasm, spreading out in a long snake formation of more than 180 li, fighting day and night on the mountainside of the Taihang Mountains, 160 meters above the riverbed. In more than a year, they had continuously drilled through more than 20 cliffs; bypassed hundreds of ravines and ridges such as Luoquanyu and Shilingdong, and excavated more than 1.79 million cubic meters of earth and stone, which, if used to build a wall one meter high and one meter wide, could encircle Hebei Province. By August of this year, more than 90% of the entire project had been completed, and the entire line was basically open. This is a miracle of overcoming drought and reversing the situation!

    Happiness Comes

　　After more than eight months of intense fighting, the first phase of the project was completed by the end of September last year. On October 1, a water test was conducted, and the Zhang River water, which people had dreamed of for thousands of years, finally went uphill. During the canal testing ceremony, the clear river water climbed up the mountain along the canal and rolled into the thirsty fields, irrigating more than 4,000 mu at once. This good news spread throughout the mountain villages of the county like wings. Wherever the canal water flowed, firecrackers were set off and gongs and drums were beaten. The northern mountainous area of She County was in a festive mood. Men, women, old and young, were happier than on any festival. The old people also seemed younger, they put on new clothes, walked out of the village with crutches, and looked and looked again at the canal.

　　The canal water going uphill brought unparalleled joy and eternal happiness to the people of the mountainous area, and the face of the mountainous area was焕然一新 (completely renewed). Irrigated by the canal water, the yield of 400 mu of wheat in Yuzhuang Village this year increased by five or six times compared to last year; with water, the peasants of this village planted more than 40,000 apple trees, mulberry trees, and willow trees in front of and behind the village, in front of and behind the courtyard. Mountain villages that had never even had vegetables to eat can now raise chickens and ducks, grow melons, and plant flowers.

    Rhapsody

　　The northern mountainous area of She County has already changed its face. However, an even more beautiful and richer picture will soon be displayed before the people: people plan to build countless branch canals, bucket canals, capillary canals, and ponds downstream of the canal this autumn, so that ditches and canals will crisscross, and wells and ponds will be scattered like stars. Various fruit trees will be planted along the canal, and ducks and fish will be raised in the ponds, and lotuses and reeds will be planted. The lonely mountainous area will become a rich land of fish and rice, and become a beautiful scenic spot. Twenty-six small hydroelectric power stations will be built along the canal to supply electricity for lighting and power machinery in mountain villages. Commune members can use electricity to pump water to irrigate fields, and use electric machinery to harvest crops; peasants who have worked a day will watch dramas, dance, study culture, listen to the radio, talk about ancient and modern times under electric lights... Electrification and mechanization are no longer a distant future, they will blossom and bear fruit in the notoriously barren mountainous area, poor mountains and bad waters will become historical names, and drought and poverty will never return!

　　The heroic people of She County, inspired by this beautiful ideal, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, and exerting the power of the collective, completed the canal opening task originally scheduled to be completed in three years in more than a year!

　　清漳河水流上山
    攀登到拔海三千多米的圣佛辿，远远望去，蜿蜒在太行山腰的涉县漳北大渠，像一条银色的巨龙凌空飞腾。漳河水穿山越涧，直泻而下，伸向涉县北部盆地。万顷层层叠叠的梯田上，白皑皑的棉花，黑油油的玉米，黄澄澄的谷子，一片接一片，翻滚着波浪，向人们发出丰收的预告。山坡上绵羊成群，山沟里牛铃叮当，山下的公路上汽车奔驰。牧童的歌声，沿渠洗衣姑娘的笑声，建筑水电站的民工的歌声，构成一曲和谐的音乐。这是多么迷人的社会主义山区景色啊！
    忆往事
    这幅美丽的图画，是劳动人民在大跃进中，在公社化以后，用自己的双手绘制成的。过去的涉北盆地是和旱灾、贫困连在一起的地方。穷山秃岭，别说引水浇地，就是吃水都很困难。有不少的人家“一水多用”：先洗菜，后洗碗，再洗衣服，甚至最后拿来饮牲口。干旱，使人们常年翻山越岭，到十几里外去担水、驮水。人都吃不到水，哪有办法引水灌田？只有瞪眼看着禾苗干枯。村与村之间，为水打官司告状，甚至械斗，不知延续了多少年代；为水，多少人家破人亡，离乡背井；为水，多少个青壮年娶不上媳妇，当一辈子光棍。过去，涉北盆地流传着这样一段歌谣：“有女不嫁西岗村，提起吃水痛伤心，十里以外去担水，挑起水桶骂媒人。”
    过去，这里的人们既盼水，又怕水。就在这些山庄不远的地方，清漳河水日夜流着，可是丰富的水利资源没有给人们造福。解放前历代统治者的无情压榨，广大贫苦农民常被逼上深山，在陡坡开荒；再加上乱伐树木，梯田失修，致使水土流失严重。一到雨季，暴雨降落，山洪暴发，冲沟毁田，不计其数。旱涝相交，人民生活困苦不堪。有一首歌谣唱道：“太行清漳高又长，穷山恶水不打粮，贫困逼人卖儿女，糠菜不足半年粮。”
    水上山
    解放后，漳河畔的农民，为了赶走贫困，在党的领导下，一直在与旱灾作斗争。几年来，开山劈石，修打了成千上万个蓄水旱池和水窖。可是这些都不能根本改变山区的面貌。一遇大旱，池池窖窖干得连点潮气都没有，解决水的问题仍然是农民最迫切的要求。
    1958年，这是一个不平常的年代。全国响起了大跃进的号角。跃进！跃进！它好像一股巨大的热流，注进了涉县每一个人的心，变成了无穷无尽的力量。为了领导农民永远摆脱干旱的威胁，中共涉县县委提出了“消灭干旱，引水上山”的口号，并且作出决议，要从水源处把漳河水引上来，绕太行山开一条漳北大渠，变九万亩干旱梯田为水浇地，从根本上改变山区干旱面貌。根据这个决议，作出规划，把山西省黎城县下清泉水（即漳河水）引到高出河底一百六十米的涉北盆地，渠道要从太行山腰曲折蜿蜒一百八十多华里，越过百道沟洼大岭，经过险恶著称的断头崖、西崖头、老虎头、凤凰山、圣佛辿等悬崖绝壁，要打土石隧洞六十五座，共长七千三百七十三米，建筑渡洪桥、水闸、桥涵、漫水坝等二百七十四座。因为这一宏伟的规划直接反映了群众的迫切要求，所以很快得到全县人民的坚决拥护。农民们把县委的决议看作是向大自然进军的动员令，向社会主义大跃进的动员令。许多党员、团员写了决心书，不少社员再三请求到最险恶的工地去。全县二百个村庄的农民都行动起来了。向自然开战的英雄们，他们扛着锨钁，担着箩筐，吆喝着牲口，像出征的战士，从四面八方奔向漳北大渠工地。非受益村也来协助受益村，大协作之风遍及全县。
    “有钱拿钱，有力出力，改造自然，建设社会主义大渠”的口号响彻云霄。非受益的西达公社老民工牛水牛在开渠的头一天就贴出了这样一张大字报：“为了咱山区子孙万代的幸福，我要和大家一起，坚决干到底！”正是这样的决心和这种共产主义的精神，鼓励人们战胜着一切困难。没有石灰自己烧，没有火药自己造，衣食工具自己带，工具坏了自己修，没有钱买木料大家凑。固新村田家祥老人把自己准备的棺材板卖了，作为投资。村里干部不肯，他就着急地说：“有了渠，我就能多活几年，现在留它干啥！”全县群众几天之内就集资二百多万元。
    1958年1月5日，漳北大渠开始动工了。开渠的英雄们在山西黎城下清泉渠口，削石山，劈森林，修过二里路，刚刚进入涉县境内，就碰上了一座没有人行道，只有鸟落脚的断头崖。崖高三十来丈，陡峭笔直，崖脚下又是几人深的大水潭，自古以来很少有人从此通过。在群众中流传着这样一句话：“宁绕百里路，不过‘断头崖’。”但是按照工程计划，渠道必须从崖的半腰间穿过。这是开渠遇到的第一道难关，也是对人们的第一个考验。英雄的人们，面对着这个艰巨而又惊险的工程，发出了豪语：“自古华山一条路，解放军打开了第二条路。这座山没有路，要由我们来劈开！”第一战斗团副团长杨坤南和杨里毛、杨毛元、程金廷、程全廷四个小伙子，挺身而出，向党表示：“不畏惊险，决心打开‘断头崖’。”他们组成了一个“决死队”，一手抓起铁锤，一手抓起钢钎，向悬崖陡壁上爬去。杨坤南爬在最前面，他紧咬牙关，一鼓作气爬上了十五丈高的半山腰。接着，三十名突击队员，一个跟一个地爬上去。山腰上站不住脚，抡不开锤，他们就用绳子捆住每个人的腰，悬空打钎钻眼。唯一的道路被乱石堵死了，他们又搭起了五十多米的软梯，四十米的云梯和八十多米的天桥，在“断头崖”中间，展开了全面的攻击战。他们先将陡壁劈成平面，然后再往下开渠，经过八个多月的战斗，挖成了三百五十米长的山腰渠；同时，在“断头崖”的突出处钻通了一百六十五米长的山洞。“断头崖”向英雄们低下了头。为了纪念这段英勇战斗，人们在“断头崖”的红崖板上刻下了“漳河搬上山，断崖两头钻，拦断漳河水，腰斩太行山，决心赛原子，不怕工程难”的豪言壮语。
    8月，在这丰收的季节里又诞生了人民公社。这个有着无比生命力的组织，刚刚诞生便推动着农村各项事业飞速发展。漳北大渠的工程，由于公社有着组织规模大，活动范围广，可以充分动员和合理安排劳动力的优越性，进度更迅速了。修渠的英雄们干劲冲天，排开一百八十多里长的长蛇阵，日日夜夜奋战在高出河底一百六十米高的太行山腰。一年多以来，一连凿通了二十多座悬崖绝壁；绕过了罗圈峪、石岭洞等百道涧沟大岭，挖了一百七十九万多立方石土，如果用它筑成一个一米高和一米宽的墙壁，可环绕河北省一圈。今年8月已经完成了全部工程的90％多，全线基本畅通。这是战胜干旱，扭转乾坤的奇迹！
    幸福来
    经过八个多月的紧张战斗，去年9月底就完成了第一期工程。10月1日试渠放水，几千年来人们梦寐以求的漳河水终于上山了。在试渠典礼的时候，清清的河水，沿着渠道爬上山来，滚滚流入如饥似渴的田地，一下就灌溉了四千多亩。这个喜讯就像长上了翅膀，立刻轰动了全县的山庄。渠水流到哪里，哪里就鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓喧天。涉北山区一片欢腾。男女老幼比过什么佳节还要高兴。老人们也显得年青了，他们换了新衣裳，拄着拐杖走出村来，在渠道上，看了还想看。
    渠水上山，为山区人民带来了无比的欢乐，带来了永恒的幸福，山区面貌焕然一新。经过渠水灌溉，今年宇庄村四百亩小麦的产量比去年提高了五、六倍；有了水，这个村的农民在村前、村后、庭前、院后栽种了四万多株苹果树、桑树和柳树。历来连菜都吃不上的山庄，现在也可以养鸡、养鸭、种瓜、栽花了。
    畅想曲
    涉北山区已经改变了面貌。然而，更美丽、更富饶的图景不久就会展现在人们的面前：人们计划今年秋后，在渠道下游修建无数的支渠、斗渠、毛渠和池塘，使沟渠纵横，井塘星罗棋布。沿渠种植各种果树，在池塘里养鸭、养鱼，种植荷花和芦苇，寂寞的山区就会变成富饶的鱼米之乡，变成优美的风景区。渠水两旁再建立二十六座小型水电站，供给山村照明和动力机械用电。公社社员们就可以用电力扬水灌溉田园，用电力机械收打庄稼；劳动一天的农民，将在电灯下看戏、跳舞，学习文化，收听广播，谈古论今……。电气化、机械化已经不是遥远的将来，它将在素称荒凉的山区开花结果，穷山、恶水，将变成历史名辞，干旱、贫困将永不复返！
    英雄的涉县人民，在这个美好理想的鼓舞下，凭仗着人民公社的无比优越性，发挥集体的力量，在一年多的时间里完成原定三年完成的开渠任务！
