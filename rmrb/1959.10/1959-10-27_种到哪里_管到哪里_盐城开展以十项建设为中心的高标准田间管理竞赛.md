Planting Where It's Sown, Managing Where It's Sown
Yancheng Launches High-Standard Field Management Competition Centered on Ten Constructions

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th) Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, is simultaneously planting and managing its autumn sowing work, not resting after sowing, but immediately mobilizing the masses to offer advice and suggestions, and launching a high-standard field management movement for autumn-sown crops throughout the county. At present, the 520,000 mu of barley, wheat, buckwheat, rapeseed, and green manure fields that have been sown throughout the county have established more than 7,000 field management professional teams (groups), with more than 70,000 laborers engaged in field management.

The characteristics of Yancheng County's autumn sowing this year are: fast progress, good quality, uniform and even emergence, and vigorous growth. Under such circumstances, some cadres and the masses developed a new sense of complacency and relaxed field management work. They were satisfied with the good start of autumn sowing, but did not understand that "a good head (good start), a thin waist (lack of management), and a thick tail (relaxation later)" would make it impossible to achieve a great leap forward next year. Some cadres have the idea of ​​emphasizing sowing and neglecting management. In fact, "sowing, management, and harvesting" are a whole, and one wrong move can lose the whole game. Before the end of autumn sowing, the county party committee, in the spirit of continuing to oppose rightism and encourage hard work, eliminated all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas in the field management work among cadres at all levels, and put forward the slogan and corresponding measures of "plant one piece, manage one piece, plant where it's sown, manage where it's sown, manage well from the beginning, and manage to the end."

All parts of the county have started by summarizing the summer harvest experience of 1959, presenting facts, and reasoning to promote the current field management work. Some communes held on-site comparison meetings for field management to conduct practical education to promote backward fields. The Yifeng Commune Party Committee selected the Xinchun Production Team, which grasped management from the beginning, and the Nan'yan Production Team, which relaxed management, as typical examples, and specially convened all production team leaders, party members, and Youth League members of the commune to visit the site. The stark contrast made everyone realize the importance of grasping management from the beginning. The Xinxing Commune held a topdressing on-site meeting in the Sanzao Brigade, and the Yongfeng Commune held a drainage and irrigation system on-site meeting in Shihua, thus enabling everyone to establish the idea of ​​"managing from the beginning, managing to the end, linking every link tightly, and not letting go of a single step" in field management.

On the basis of conducting ideological education, in the spirit of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of enthusiasm," the masses were mobilized to offer advice and suggestions. More than 100,000 suggestions were made throughout the county. Based on the experience of implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture over the years and the opinions of the masses, the county party committee proposed ten basic constructions for field management of summer crops: (1) establish field management professional teams, (2) establish a responsibility system, (3) establish a complete drainage and irrigation system, (4) establish field fertilizer depots, (5) establish experimental fields and high-yield fields, (6) reform agricultural tools for field management, (7) enclose the fields near villages with firewood and bamboo to prevent livestock from trampling on them, (8) vigorously develop indigenous pesticides, (9) establish field management archives, and (10) establish seed retention bases.

At present, in addition to leaving some labor to take care of late-stage sowing, more than 7,000 field management professional teams (groups) have been established for wheat, rapeseed, and green manure fields throughout the county, with more than 70,000 laborers engaged in field management. A high-standard field management team competition centered on the ten major constructions is being carried out among professional teams. From the county party committee, communes to brigades, each level divides and contracts out areas, each level establishes pacesetters, and conducts regular inspections and evaluations to continuously push the team competition to a climax. Zhu Fukuan, the first secretary of the Yongfeng Commune Party Committee, personally helped the Yuanhe Production Team of the Shihua Brigade to do a good job in the ten basic constructions and establish a comprehensive pacesetter for high-standard field management. Wang Beilin, the leader of the Jiefang Production Team of the Sanxing Brigade, initially had a fear of high-standard field management. After visiting the Yuanhe Team on-site, he saw the model, learned the method, and went back to form a professional team and build field fertilizer depots in the fields overnight. Field manager Qian Renjia mobilized his whole family to weave firewood and bamboo fences overnight, and in two days, all the fields in front of his house and behind his house were enclosed. As a result, the Jiefang Team not only caught up with the Yuanhe Team, but also surpassed the Yuanhe Team in some projects.

Up to now, the 520,000 mu of wheat, rapeseed, and green manure that have been sown throughout the county have generally established drainage and irrigation systems, and have successively dredged and excavated more than 3,700 drainage and irrigation ditches; more than 30% of the fields have established a total of 7,000 field fertilizer depots, most of which have been filled with mud, slag, and miscellaneous fertilizers; more than 22,000 small carts and other tools have been repaired and newly added. Now, the people of the county are advancing victoriously, continuing to vigorously engage in manure accumulation and high-standard management, and fighting to strive for a great harvest of summer crops next year!

    种到哪里　管到哪里
    盐城开展以十项建设为中心的高标准田间管理竞赛
    本报南京26日电  江苏省盐城县秋播工作边种边管，种了之后不歇气，立即发动群众献计献策，在全县范围内开展秋播作物高标准的田间管理运动。目前，全县已种的五十二万亩大麦、小麦、元麦、油菜、绿肥田，建立好田间管理专业队（组）七千多个，投入田间管理的劳力达七万多人。
    盐城县今年秋播的特点是：进度快，质量好，出苗整齐均匀，生长茁壮。在这样的情况下，一部分干部和群众产生了新的自满情绪，放松田间管理工作。他们满足于秋播的头抓得好，而不了解“头好（开头好）、腰细（管理上没力）、尾粗（后来放松）”是不可能实现明年大跃进的。有的干部有重播种轻管理的思想，实际上“种、管、收”是一个整体，一着不到就能输了满盘棋。县委在秋播还没有结束的时候，在各级干部中以继续反右倾鼓干劲的精神，破除田间管理工作中形形色色的右倾保守思想，提出了“种一块，管一块，种到哪里，管到哪里，从头管好，一管到底”的口号和相应的措施。
    全县各地都通过总结1959年夏季丰收经验入手，摆事实，讲道理，以促进当前的田间管理工作。有些公社召开田间管理的对比现场会，进行实际教育，以促进落后田。义丰公社社党委选择了从头抓管理的新春生产队和放松管理的南严生产队作为典型，专门召集了全社生产队长和党、团员，前往现场参观。鲜明的事实对比，使大家认清了从头抓好管理的重要性。新兴公社在三灶大队召开了追肥现场会，永丰公社在石华召开了排灌系统现场会，从而使每个人树立起“从头管起，一管到底，环环扣紧，一着不让”的田间管理的思想。
    在进行思想教育的基础上，本着“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的精神，发动群众献计献策。全县共献策献计十万多条。县委根据历年来执行农业八字宪法的经验和群众意见，提出夏熟作物田间管理十大基本建设：（1）建立田间管理专业队伍，（2）建立责任制，（3）建立完整的排灌体系，（4）建立田头肥库，（5）建立试验田、丰产田，（6）改革田间管理的农具，（7）靠村庄的田用柴箔围好，防止畜禽糟蹋，（8）大搞土农药，（9）建立田间管理档案，（10）建立留种基地。
    目前全县除留部分劳力照顾到晚茬田播种以外，已建立三麦、油菜、绿肥田间管理专业队（组）七千多个，投入田间管理的劳力达七万多人。在专业队之间普遍开展以十大建设为中心的高标准田间管理队际竞赛。从县委、公社到大队，层层划片包干，层层树立标兵，开展定期检查评比，把队际竞赛不断推向高潮。永丰公社党委第一书记朱福宽，亲自帮助石华大队袁河生产队，搞好十项基本建设，树立高标准田间管理的全面标兵。三星大队解放生产队队长王北林，开始对高标准田间管理有畏难情绪，到袁河队现场参观后，看到了样子，学会了办法，回去成立了专业队，连夜在田里造田头肥库。田间管理员钱仁甲动员全家连夜编柴箔子，两天时间就把门前宅后田全部围好。结果，解放队不但赶上了袁河队，有些项目还超过了袁河队。
    到目前止，全县已播种的五十二万亩三麦、油菜、绿肥，已经普遍建立好排灌系统，先后疏通、开挖排灌渠三千七百多条；有30％以上的田建立了田头肥库共七千个，这些肥库已大部分贮满泥渣杂肥；整修和新添小车子等工具二万二千余件。现在，全县人民正乘胜前进，继续大搞积肥，大搞高标准管理，为力争明年夏熟作物大丰收而战！
