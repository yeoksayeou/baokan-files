Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 20th: More than 20,000 workers in twenty-two factories in Tianjin's machinery industry are making every effort to increase the production of agricultural machinery to support agricultural production.

In the third quarter, these factories produced more than 3,000 gas engines, gasoline engines, cotton gins, and other power equipment and agricultural product processing equipment for rural areas. They also produced a large number of tractor and internal combustion engine parts. In order to support the continued great leap forward in agricultural production next year and accelerate the realization of agricultural technological transformation, these factories have new growth in production plans for agricultural production materials in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the city's machinery industry will produce 5,380 power machines with more than 32,000 horsepower, more than 2,000 agricultural product processing machines, and more than 4 million tractor, internal combustion engine, and other parts.

In order to ensure the completion of this task, the machinery industry department has arranged agricultural machinery production tasks for factories that did not produce agricultural machinery in the past. On the other hand, it has organized the original factories to actively tap production potential, add equipment, and improve labor productivity. The workers in each factory are also full of enthusiasm and are carrying out technical innovations in a big way. The workers of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory, which produces gas engines, have formed a "Forging and Casting Equipment Group" using a three-in-one method to manufacture forging and casting machinery and process agricultural machinery parts in response to the factory's lack of forging and casting equipment. The production of cotton gins and cotton seed delinting machines by the Machinery and Equipment Factory in the fourth quarter exceeded the total output of the entire year last year. Wang Xihou, a veteran worker and municipal labor model in the sheet metal group, led the group to carry out technical innovations in a big way, turning 90% of the group's manual labor into mechanical and semi-mechanical operations, increasing labor efficiency by more than 100 times. As of the first half of October, ninety-one workers in this factory had completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule and entered 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 20th: The Hubei Provincial Machinery Industry Department held a meeting of agricultural machinery bureau chiefs and factory directors from the 12th to the 18th to comprehensively arrange the agricultural machinery production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and next year, striving to produce more agricultural machinery and tools to support the great leap forward in agricultural production.

According to the plan, the power machinery, water pumps, agricultural tillage machinery, new-style farm tools, agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, and transportation tools that Hubei's agricultural machinery factories will produce for rural areas this fourth quarter and next year will be more than at any time in the past. Among them, the production in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year alone will include 65,000 horsepower of power machinery, 60,000 deep plows, 98,000 pesticide applicators, 110,000 rubber-tired carts, and a large number of rammers, iron shovels, and hoes for water conservancy projects to be built this winter and next spring.

The machinery factories will also mass-produce new products according to the needs of developing agricultural mechanization. This fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year will see the trial production of 28 types of products, including ДT-28 tractors, 8-12 horsepower cultivators, electric plows, and oil presses.

From January to September this year, the workers of Hubei's machinery factories, especially the agricultural tool factories in special districts and counties, overcame difficulties such as poor equipment conditions and a lack of raw materials, and successfully completed the production tasks of agricultural machinery and farm tools. According to incomplete statistics from January to August alone, more than 86,000 sets (pieces) of twelve varieties were produced. The 55,400 horsepower of diesel engines, gas engines, and other power machinery and 2,300 water pumps produced from January to September exceeded the plan. In addition, a large number of agricultural machinery repair and parts tasks were completed, effectively supporting agricultural production and drought resistance efforts. With the comprehensive development of rural people's communes production, the mechanical industry needs to provide more agricultural machinery, agricultural and sideline product processing machinery and transportation tools. The bureau chiefs and factory directors who attended this meeting unanimously stated that they would complete this year's agricultural machinery production plan half a month to a month ahead of schedule, and prepare for a greater leap forward next year.

This meeting required all machinery factories in the province to deeply criticize right-leaning ideology, carry out the increase production and practice economy movement in a thorough and sustained manner, mobilize the masses to carry out technical innovations in a big way around key production areas, implement measures to increase production and practice economy, and strive to produce products with large quantities, high quality, and low prices for rural areas.

    为明年大丰收添力量送千万台机器到公社
    天津湖北安排农业机械生产
    新华社天津20日电　天津市机械行业二十二个工厂的两万多名职工，千方百计增产农业机械支援农业生产。
    这些工厂在第三季度里曾为农村生产了三千多台煤气机、汽油机、轧花机等动力设备和农产品加工设备，还生产了大批拖拉机和内燃机的各种配件。为了支援农业生产明年继续大跃进和加速实现农业技术改造，在第四季度里这些工厂有关农业生产资料的生产计划又有新的增长。第四季度全市机械工业将生产出五千三百八十台、三万二千多匹马力的动力机械和二千多台农产品加工机械，以及拖拉机、内燃机等配件四百多万件。
    为了保证完成这一任务，机械工业部门一方面为过去不生产农业机械的工厂，安排了农业机械生产任务；另一方面组织原有工厂积极挖掘生产潜力、增添设备，提高劳动生产率。各厂职工也都人人干劲冲天，大闹技术革新。生产煤气机的内燃机厂职工，针对工厂锻铸设备不足的情况，采用三结合的办法成立了“锻铸设备小组”自制锻铸机械，加工农业机械部件。机械制配厂第四季度为农村生产的轧花机和棉籽脱绒机，超过去年全年的产量。钣金小组的老工人、市劳动模范王锡侯带领全组工人大搞技术革新，使全组90％的手工劳动改为机械和半机械操作，劳动效率提高了一百倍以上。截至10月上半月，这个厂已有九十一名职工提前完成全年的生产任务，跨进1960年。
    新华社武汉20日电　湖北省机械工业厅12日至18日召开全省农业机械局长、厂长会议，全面安排了今年第四季度和明年的农业机械生产任务，力争生产出更多的农业机械和工具，支援农业生产大跃进。
    根据计划，湖北省农业机械工厂今年四季度和明年为农村生产的动力机械、水泵、农业耕作机械和新式农具、农副产品加工机械和运输工具等，比过去任何时期都多。其中，单是在今年第四季度和明年第一季度生产的，就有动力机械六万五千匹马力，深耕犁六万部，药械九万八千台，胶轮板车十一万辆，以及大批今冬明春兴修水利用的打夯机、铁锹、洋镐等。
    各机械工厂还将根据发展农业机械化的需要，大量试制新产品。今年四季度和明年一季度，就将试制ДT二十八拖拉机、八至十二匹马力的耕耘机、电犁、榨油机等二十八种。
    今年1至9月份，湖北省机械工厂特别是专区、县农具厂职工，克服设备条件差，原材料缺乏的困难，出色地完成了农业机械和农具的生产任务。仅据1至8月份的不完全统计，就生产了十二个品种、八万六千多台（件）。1至9月份生产的柴油机、煤气机等动力机械五万五千四百匹马力，水泵二千三百台，超额完成了计划。另外还完成了大量的农业机具的修配任务，有力支援了农业生产和抗旱运动。随着农村人民公社生产的全面发展，需要机械工业提供更多的农业机械、农副产品加工机械和运输工具。参加这次会议的局长和厂长，根据这一情况一致表示要提前半个月至一个月，完成今年的农业机械生产计划，并为明年更大的跃进做好准备。
    这次会议要求全省机械工厂深入批判右倾思想，把增产节约运动深入持久地开展下去，围绕生产关键发动群众大闹技术革新，实现增产节约措施，力争为农村生产出数量多、质量高、价格便宜的产品。
