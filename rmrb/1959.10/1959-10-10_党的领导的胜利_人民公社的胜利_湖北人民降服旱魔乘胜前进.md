The victory of the Party's Leadership, The Victory of the People's Communes
The People of Hubei Conquer the Drought Demon and Advance Victoriously

The heroic people of Hubei, facing the worst drought in seventy years, after eighty to ninety days of fighting the drought, reaped a great harvest of early rice, preserved the harvests of mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and cotton, and rushed to plant more than three million mu of double-crop late rice and a large area of late autumn dryland crops... expanding the irrigated area by nearly 20 million mu.

Wuhan, October 9th (reported by this newspaper) – The entire Party and all the people of Hubei Province, after eighty to ninety days of fighting the drought, have achieved a decisive victory. In late September, most parts of the province received welcome rainfall. Now, the broad masses of farmers are full of enthusiasm and are launching a new high tide of production involving rushing to cultivate, rush to plant, rush to harvest, and vigorously cultivating late autumn crops.

The duration, area, and severity of the drought in Hubei Province this year are unprecedented in decades. According to records, since 1889, there have been nine years with relatively severe droughts, but generally, they only lasted for about fifty to sixty days. This year, from the end of June to mid-September, most areas had basically no rain, and the drought lasted for eighty to ninety days. Out of the province's total cultivated land area of 62 million mu, more than 50 million mu were threatened by drought. The Jianghan Plain and parts of eastern Hubei, which are rich in grain and cotton, were particularly severely affected.

Without the strong leadership of the Party and without the People's Communes, it would have been unimaginable to overcome this drought. As soon as the drought signs appeared this year, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Party organizations at all levels immediately led and mobilized more than seven million people to engage in a tenacious fight against the drought. More than 140,000 cadres throughout the province, including the secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, the People's Committee, and the principal leaders of organizations at all levels, went deep into the forefront of the drought resistance effort. In addition, the province's transportation, industry, commerce, health, and other departments also enthusiastically joined the struggle. People put forward the heroic slogan "Resist the drought wherever it occurs, resist it until it ends."

The drought resistance struggle in Hubei Province was carried out in two stages. The first stage, from the appearance of the drought to the end of July, focused on protecting the mid-season rice; the second stage, from early August to the widespread rainfall, focused on protecting the late rice. Through the struggle, people seized a great harvest of early rice from the drought demon, basically preserved the harvests of mid-season rice, single-crop late rice, and cotton, and also fought the drought to rush-plant more than three million mu of double-crop late rice. A large area of late autumn dryland crops were also planted by fighting the drought, and these crops, after drought resistance to protect production, are currently growing very well. The task of fighting the drought was arduous. Especially after entering September, with the development of the drought, water sources became increasingly scarce, most of the ponds and weirs dried up, and small rivers stopped flowing; in addition, people were exhausted after more than two months of day and night hard work. Therefore, some cadres and the masses developed feelings of fear and relaxation in the face of serious difficulties. At this critical juncture determining the final victory or defeat of the drought resistance effort, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the great call of "Oppose Rightism, Boost Enthusiasm." Cadres at all levels in Hubei Province enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party, and, in light of the specific conditions in rural Hubei, focused on analyzing the favorable conditions for persisting in the drought resistance effort to the end, criticized the feelings of fear and relaxation and the right-leaning conservative ideas of a few cadres, and, at the same time, carried out a vigorous general line and socialist education among the broad masses of commune members. Under the call of the Party, the entire Party and all the people were even more inspired with soaring enthusiasm, determined to overcome all difficulties and bravely advance with renewed efforts. During this period, cadres and the masses in various parts of the province, with the spirit of overwhelming mountains and rivers, marched towards rivers and lakes, overcame the difficulty of water source depletion, and launched a new high tide of production to protect and surpass the planned production targets. For example, in the Huanggang Prefecture, where water sources were relatively scarce, the broad masses of cadres and the masses, after draining the water from ponds, weirs, small ditches, and small rivers, immediately mobilized manpower and turned to rivers and lakes. They moved water from the Yangtze River in more than 150 places and from large lakes in more than 2,000 places, rescuing more than one million mu of rice paddies. Some places also created methods of "rivers within rivers" and "ponds controlled within ponds." For example, Zhulin Commune in Qichun County dug more than 900 water-retaining embankments, each more than two zhang deep, in a dry riverbed 25 li long, ensuring a bountiful harvest of more than 5,000 mu of crops. On the vast Jianghan Plain in the Jingzhou and Xiaogan Prefectures, since the Yangtze River and Han River run through it and the lakes are scattered like stars, the struggle to get water from the rivers and lakes was even more vigorous and magnificent when the water source became tight in the later stage of the drought resistance, and the production situation was changing with each passing day. Guo Yuanhua, an old commune member of Tanqiao Commune in Jiangling County, could not help but write a poem with excitement: "Go to the great rivers and lakes to fetch water, what is there to fear even after a hundred days without rain! The People's Commune is really good, a great disaster can also bring a great harvest."

In the struggle to overcome this severe drought, which has rarely been seen in decades, the People's Communes have demonstrated enormous power. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 190,000 new and expanded large and small canals were built throughout the province in the drought resistance struggle, more than 200,000 wells, sand dams, and spring eyes were dug, and more than 96,000 dams were built across rivers, expanding the irrigated area by nearly 20 million mu. In completing the above water conservancy projects, the People's Communes in various places, under the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, carried out comprehensive large-scale cooperation in labor, water sources, and tools, so that some projects that had not been completed in the past few years were completed in one go in a very short time. The rational allocation of water and mutual support were a more common form of cooperation among the People's Communes in various places in the drought resistance struggle. In particular, since the drought this year occurred during the period of rushing to harvest early rice, rush to plant late rice, mid-season rice flowering and filling, and cotton growth, many areas felt that there was a shortage of labor and tools. On the other hand, due to the different water conservancy conditions, different amounts of labor, and different distributions of aquatic and dryland crops in various places, some areas had greater difficulties and some areas had smaller difficulties. Therefore, the People's Communes in various places attached great importance to carrying out cooperation in tools and labor. In Nanzha Commune in Gong'an County, two teams were severely affected by the drought, 18 teams were less affected, and nine teams were not affected. The commune organized the unaffected teams to support the affected teams, and the teams with lighter drought to support the teams with severe drought, so that more than 40,000 mu of drought-stricken land in the entire commune could be guaranteed a harvest. Various places also used the favorable conditions of the communes to carry out tool reforms. Many communes realized the mechanization and animalization of water lifting, which not only saved a large amount of labor, but also greatly improved the efficiency of irrigation.

At present, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, the broad masses of farmers throughout the province, while celebrating the great victory of the drought resistance struggle, are, according to the different rainfall conditions in various places, in addition to continuing to do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, concentrating their efforts to seize the opportunity to take advantage of the deep soil moisture to deeply plow the land, rush to plant winter-sown crops and vegetables, vigorously process and cultivate late rice crops, and vigorously carry out fertilizer accumulation work. By the end of September, more than 21 million mu of land had been deeply plowed throughout the province, more than 14 million mu of summer grains had been sown, and 3.7 billion dan of fertilizer had been accumulated. A comprehensive production upsurge of striving for a great harvest in a great disaster, supplementing deficiencies with surpluses, and protecting and surpassing planned production targets has been vigorously launched throughout the province.

    党的领导的胜利  人民公社的胜利
    湖北人民降服旱魔乘胜前进
    英勇的湖北人民，在七十年来未遇的大旱面前，经过八、九十天的抗旱斗争，夺取了早稻大丰收，保住了中稻、一季晚稻和棉花丰收，抢插抢种了三百多万亩二季晚稻和大面积晚秋旱地作物……，扩大了灌溉面积近二千万亩。
    本报武汉9日电　湖北省全党全民经过八、九十天的抗旱斗争，已经取得决定性的胜利。9月下旬全省绝大部分地区普降喜雨，现在广大农民干劲冲天，掀起了抢耕、抢种、抢收和突击培育晚秋作物的生产新高潮。
    湖北省今年受旱时间之久、面积之大、情况之严重是几十年来所未有的。根据记载，自1889年起七十年来，其中有九年旱灾较为严重，但一般也只旱五、六十天左右。今年自6月底到9月中旬，绝大部分地区基本无雨，干旱持续了八、九十天。全省共有耕地面积六千二百万亩，其中五千多万亩遭受旱灾威胁。盛产粮棉的江汉平原及鄂东部分地区受旱特别严重。
    没有党的坚强领导，没有人民公社，要战胜这场干旱，简直是不可想像的。今年旱象刚刚露头，中共湖北省委及各级党组织，立即领导和动员了七百多万人投入了顽强的抗旱斗争。全省十四万多名干部，其中包括省委书记、省人民委员会和各级组织的主要负责人，都深入抗旱最前线。此外，全省的交通运输、工业、商业、卫生等部门，也都踊跃地加入了斗争的行列。人们提出“旱到哪里抗到哪里，旱到何时抗到何时”的豪迈口号。
    湖北省的抗旱斗争，是分两个阶段进行的。从旱象发生到7月底，是以保中稻为中心的第一个阶段；从8月上旬到普降喜雨止，是以保晚稻为中心的第二阶段。通过斗争，人们从旱魔手里夺得了早稻大丰收，基本上保住了中稻、一季晚稻和棉花的丰收，还抗旱抢插了三百多万亩二季晚稻。大面积晚秋旱地作物也都是抗旱抢种的，这些作物经过抗旱保产，目前生长情况大都很好。抗旱斗争的任务是艰巨的，特别是进入9月以后，随着旱情的发展，水源越来越困难，绝大多数的塘堰干涸了，小河断流了；加以人们经过两个多月的日夜苦战，人困马乏。因此，有一部分干部和群众，在严重困难面前产生了畏难、松劲情绪。正在这个决定抗旱最后胜败的关头，党的八届八中全会提出了“反右倾，鼓干劲”的伟大号召，湖北省各级干部热烈地响应了党的号召，针对湖北农村的具体情况，着重分析了坚持抗旱到底的有利条件，批判了少数干部的畏难松劲情绪和右倾保守思想，同时在广大的公社社员中，深入地开展了轰轰烈烈的总路线和社会主义教育。全党全民在党的号召下，更加鼓起了冲天干劲，决心战胜一切困难，再接再励地奋勇前进。这一时期，全省各地干部和群众以气吞山河的气概，向江河湖泊进军，克服了水源枯竭的困难，掀起了保规划超规划的生产新高潮。例如，水源比较困难的黄冈专区，广大干部和群众在车干塘堰、小沟小河的水以后，立即调动人马，转战江河湖泊，仅搬长江的水就有一百五十多处，搬大湖水有二千多处，抢救了一百多万亩稻谷。有些地方还创造了河里套河、塘中控塘的办法。如蕲春县株林公社在一条长二十五华里的枯水河床上，掏了九百多个浸水垱，垱深达两丈多，确保了五千多亩作物丰收。在荆州、孝感专区的广大江汉平原上，由于长江、汉水横贯其间，湖泊星罗棋布，因而在抗旱后期水源吃紧时，向江河湖泊要水的斗争更是风起云涌，气势磅礴，生产局面日新月异。江陵县滩桥公社有个叫郭远华的老社员止不住心情的激动，便写诗赞道：“大江大湖去取水，百日无雨又何愁！人民公社实在好，大灾也能大丰收。”
    在战胜这个几十年来所仅见的严重旱灾的斗争中，人民公社发挥了巨大无比的威力。据不完全统计，全省在抗旱斗争中，新建和扩修的大小渠道近十九万多条，打井、掏沙垱、泉眼二十多万处，拦河筑坝九万六千多处，共扩大灌溉面积约近二千万亩。在完成上述水利工程中，各地人民公社在等价互利的原则下，开展劳力、水源、工具等全面大协作，使一些过去几年没有完成的工程，这次只用了很短的时间，就被人们一鼓作气地修成。用水的合理调剂，互相支援，是各地人民公社在抗旱斗争中开展协作的一种较普遍的形式，特别是由于今年旱情发生在抢收早稻、抢插晚稻、中稻扬花灌浆和棉花长桃壮桃的时候，许多地区感到劳动力和工具不足。另一方面，由于各地水利条件不同，劳动力多少不同，水旱作物分布不同，有的地区困难较大，有的地区困难较小，因此，各地人民公社对开展工具和劳力的协作极为重视。公安县南闸公社旱情严重的有两个队，受旱较轻的有十八个队，没有受旱的有九个队。公社就组织没受旱的支援受旱的，旱情轻的支援旱情重的，使全社四万多亩受旱田地都能保收。各地还利用公社的有利条件，大搞工具改革，许多公社实现了车水畜力化、风力化，这就不仅节省了大批劳力，而且大大提高了灌田效率。
    目前全省广大农民在各级党组织的领导下，在庆祝抗旱斗争伟大胜利的同时，正根据各地降雨的不同情况，除了继续做好防旱、抗旱的工作外，正集中全力抓住时机，趁墒深翻土地，抢种冬播作物和蔬菜，突击进行晚稻作物的加工培育和大搞积肥工作。到9月底，全省已深翻土地两千一百多万亩，播种夏杂粮一千四百多万亩，积肥三十七亿担。一个争取大灾大丰收，以丰补歉，保规划超规划的全面生产高潮，已经在全省范围内蓬勃开展起来。
