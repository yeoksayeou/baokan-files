As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, the entire country is rejoicing. The entire workforce on China's chemical industry front is also enthusiastically responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to commemorate this great festival with outstanding achievements in production and construction.

Over the past ten years since the founding of the nation, China's chemical industry has gone through three stages: the recovery period, the period of the First Five-Year Plan, and the great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. Thanks to the attention and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the chemical industry has made tremendous progress in a short period of ten years. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total output value of the chemical industry increased nearly three times, and the variety of products increased from more than 270 to more than 1,500. During these five years, the large-scale, modern Jilin Chemical Industrial Base was built. Several chemical industrial bases, such as Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and Jintang in Sichuan, also began construction during the First Five-Year Plan period and have now been fully or partially completed and put into production. Here, the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries have given us great assistance. The original enterprises, such as Dalian Chemical Plant, Nanjing Yongli Ning Plant, and Jinxi Chemical Plant, have also undergone major expansions, thus taking on a new look, greatly increasing production capacity, and becoming important chemical industrial bases in our country. While production and construction progressed, the technical force also developed and grew. From 1949 to 1957, the number of chemical engineering and technical personnel increased by 3.4 times. These great achievements during the First Five-Year Plan created favorable conditions for the further development of the chemical industry.

In 1958 and 1959, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the chemical industry has made a great leap forward. In the past two years, the state's investment in the chemical industry has been equivalent to twice the investment in the First Five-Year Plan, and the increased output of several major products is close to or exceeds the total increase in the First Five-Year Plan. The total output value in 1958 increased by 70% compared with the previous year (excluding the products of enterprises using indigenous methods and the chemical products of light industrial departments), and nearly 700 new products were added. The total output value in 1959 will increase by another 40% compared with 1958, and the growth rate of several major products will greatly exceed the average growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan. The completion of this year's plan means that among the eight chemical products listed in the Second Five-Year Plan, three major products, namely soda ash, caustic soda, and antibiotics, will reach the 1962 targets three years ahead of schedule.

The most prominent feature of the great leap forward in the chemical industry that began in 1958 is the combination of "indigenous" and "foreign" methods and the vigorous development of mass movements.

The most vivid and prominent feature of the great leap forward in the chemical industry that began in 1958 is the close integration of mass movements in large-scale enterprises and foreign-style production with mass movements in small-scale enterprises and indigenous production. The "small indigenous groups" movement has greatly promoted the development of the chemical industry. The reason why this mass movement was able to be launched is that, under the encouragement of the general line, the broad masses implemented the policy of putting politics in command, emancipating the mind, breaking down superstitions, and daring to think, speak, and act, as proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and implemented a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," and implementing the policy of vigorously developing mass movements on the industrial front, thereby highly promoting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and a mass chemical industry "small indigenous groups" (some are "small foreign groups") movement emerged. The enthusiasm of the masses broke the mysterious view of running the chemical industry. They rarely asked the state for money and self-reliantly established a large number of small-scale indigenous chemical plants in just a few months. Like Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, regions with very poor chemical industrial bases in the past, or even no chemical industry at all, relied on the enthusiasm of the masses to also set up many small chemical plants. In the vast rural areas of our country, from special districts and counties to people's communes, many chemical plants have also been set up, which has opened up a new road for the development of our country's chemical industry.

Relying on the masses to run the chemical industry can not only run more but also run well. At present, the annual output of sulfur and potassium nitrate, important chemical products, which reaches hundreds of thousands of tons, are all produced by indigenous methods.

Facts have proved that relying on the masses to run the chemical industry can not only run more, but also run well. For example, Shangqiu County in Henan Province, using the local nitrate soil as raw material, set up a chemical plant. First, it produced phosphate and potash fertilizers. The results of using the fertilizer were very good, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, they further comprehensively utilized nitrate soil to produce potassium nitrate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, nitrate, hydrochloric acid, and other products. This factory did not have a single technician, but after hard work, they finally raised the purity of potassium nitrate to 99.94%. In Dayi County, Sichuan Province, ten small chemical plants were set up within a few months, and 48 kinds of chemical products were successfully trial-produced, including calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, sulfuric acid, soda ash, veterinary chlortetracycline, acetic acid, glucose, and other 24 kinds of products that have been produced in batches. It is expected that all the investment of the ten factories can be recovered this year. Examples like Shangqiu and Dayi are not isolated. The chemical industry "small indigenous groups" that have been set up in many places across the country have embarked on the road of consolidation and development after rectification, and they play a demonstration role for the future development of the chemical industry "small indigenous groups".

The movement to vigorously develop chemical industry "small indigenous groups" emerged in the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the whole people running industry. The development of chemical industry "small indigenous groups" in turn promoted the great leap forward in agriculture and other local industries. Last year, the indigenous chemical fertilizers and indigenous pesticides produced in various places satisfied the urgent needs of agriculture at that time to a considerable extent, and the acids and alkalis produced by indigenous methods met the local needs to a certain extent. The sulfuric acid produced by indigenous methods in Hubei Province is mainly used for chemical fertilizers. Yongchun, Fujian Province, uses sulfuric acid produced by indigenous methods to refine metals. Xinjiang uses sulfuric acid produced by indigenous methods to refine petroleum. Many places use sulfuric acid produced by indigenous methods to charge batteries, ensuring the driving of automobiles. Sulfur is widely used in medicine, rubber, pesticides, light industry, and other departments. At present, the annual output of sulfur in our country reaches hundreds of thousands of tons, all of which are produced by indigenous methods. Potassium nitrate is an important chemical product, which is used in national defense, cutting-edge industries, and many industrial departments, and is exported in large quantities to support brotherly countries. This important product is also entirely produced by indigenous methods. The hydrochloric acid needed by small and medium-sized cities in Liaoning Province is mostly supplied by indigenous production. The electrolytic caustic soda produced by indigenous methods in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province, guarantees the needs of local soap production. In the first half of this year, the chemical fertilizers produced by indigenous methods across the country, according to incomplete statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, were about three million tons. In the first half of this year, a lot of chemical raw materials were produced by small chemical plants, such as sulfuric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid, etc. In the current situation of insufficient chemical raw materials, the production of small enterprises using indigenous methods, foreign methods, or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods has made an important supplement to the production of large and medium-sized enterprises, which is of great significance for meeting the urgent needs of society, especially for meeting the needs of agriculture and local industries.

Vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" has cultivated a large number of chemical technical forces. Wherever "small indigenous groups" are run, a group of workers with preliminary chemical knowledge have been trained. In the past year, according to incomplete statistics, more than 32,000 technical workers have been trained through running "small indigenous groups" in various places. This figure does not include the number of people sent out for internships in various places. This technical force will surely play a major role in the rapid development of China's chemical industry in the future.

In the situation of vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" last year, the Ministry of Chemical Industry sent many work teams to various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to promote the small-scale indigenous production of 79 kinds of chemical products. Practice over the past year or so has proved that, except for a few products, most of the 79 kinds of products have passed or are passing the technical level in production. At the same time, in practice, many places have made modifications to the design of small factories according to local conditions, making the design of many "small indigenous groups" more perfect. At present, many small factories have begun to develop towards "small foreign groups" according to the needs of production. Simple machines have been adopted in places where too much manual labor is used; simple instruments have been adopted for production processes that are difficult to control manually; the supply of raw materials and fuels has generally been adjusted, thereby avoiding long-distance transportation; necessary production management and technical management have also been gradually established. From the practice of the past year or so, various places have also gained some production technical management experience and cultivated a group of management cadres, which has made necessary technical and organizational preparations for further vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" in the future.

Thanks to the mass movement of vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups", a large number of small chemical plants were established in vast areas of the country within a few months.

The achievements of the chemical industry "small indigenous groups" movement that began to develop last year are tremendous. Without the mass movement of vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" last year, it would have been impossible to establish a large number of small chemical plants in vast areas of the country in just a few months. Relying on the broad masses to run the chemical industry, the situation will inevitably be booming, and China's chemical industry will definitely be able to develop at a high speed. The tremendous achievements of the chemical industry "small indigenous groups" movement fully prove that the policy of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong of developing both central and local industries, both large, medium-sized, and small enterprises, and both foreign and indigenous production methods is completely correct. The implementation of the policy of "walking on two legs" is the fundamental path for the high-speed development of China's chemical industry.

Right-leaning opportunists and comrades with right-leaning thoughts do not approve of vigorously developing "small indigenous groups". They have been pouring cold water and blowing cold air, saying that the chemical industry is technically complex and should not be run by the masses, and that "small indigenous groups" cannot be developed. They turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the tremendous achievements made in vigorously developing "small indigenous groups". They seize on individual and temporary shortcomings, exaggerate them, and spread a negative atmosphere. When some "small indigenous groups" started production, due to imperfect design and unskilled operation by workers, production was not normal. Therefore, they asserted that the "small indigenous groups" could not pass the technical barrier. When some "small indigenous groups" were first established, due to lack of experience in operation and management, the cost was high. They asserted that the "small indigenous groups" could not pass the economic barrier. In their opinion, vigorously developing chemical industry "small indigenous groups" last year was "not very effective", or "not effective at all", was "a great failure", and was "not worth the loss". This right-leaning thought also affected some comrades who were more active in running "small indigenous groups" in the past for a period of time. They also had doubts and wavered about vigorously developing "small indigenous groups". Therefore, for a short period of time this year, a gust of wind seemed to indicate that vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" last year was a mistake, and that "small indigenous groups" were no longer popular.

Can the chemical industry "small indigenous groups" pass the technical barrier? The so-called failure to pass the technical barrier simply means that the production of some small factories is not normal. In fact, most of the chemical products that we have promoted and adopted for small-scale indigenous and small-scale foreign production in the past year are technically mature and can pass the barrier. Some products that are not yet technically mature have been stopped from being promoted except for experimentation. For technically mature products, a few were not normal when they started production, mainly due to the lack of necessary technical workers who could not master the operation skillfully for a while, or because the equipment used in some places was pieced together and did not fully meet the production requirements, so that they could not master certain chemical reactions in the production process well. We believe that the technical and economic barrier for chemical industry "small indigenous groups" should be regarded as a process of development. We believe that the problems can be gradually solved, and the production of the vast majority of "small indigenous groups" can gradually become normal. Taking the indigenous production of sulfuric acid as an example, the same production method, the production is very normal in some places, and the production is very abnormal in some places. Obviously, this is not that the "small indigenous groups" cannot pass the barrier at all, but that the specific problems in production have not been properly solved.

    高速度发展化学工业的道路
    化学工业部副部长　吴黎平
    第二个五年计划所列八种化工产品中有三种主要产品今年就可达到1962年生产水平
    庆祝建国十周年，万民欢腾，普天同庆。我国化学工业战线的全体职工，也正在热烈响应党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的号召，努力以出色的生产、建设成绩，来纪念这个伟大的节日。
    建国十年来，我国化学工业经过了恢复时期、第一个五年计划时期、1958年和1959年的大跃进三个阶段。由于党中央的重视和正确领导，化学工业在短短的十年时间里，有了巨大的发展。第一个五年计划期间，化学工业总产值增长将近三倍，产品品种由二百七十多种增加到一千五百多种。在这五年内，建成了规模巨大的现代化的吉林化工基地。兰州、太原、石家庄、四川金堂等几个化工基地，也在第一个五年计划时期开始建设，现在已先后全部或部分建成投入生产。在这里，苏联和其他兄弟国家给了我们很大的援助。大连化工厂、南京永利宁厂、锦西化工厂等原有企业，也经过了重大的扩建，因而面貌一新，生产能力大增，成为我国重要的化工基地。在生产、建设进展的同时，技术力量也发展壮大了。1949年到1957年，化工工程技术人员增加了三点四倍。第一个五年计划期间这些巨大成就，为化学工业的进一步发展创造了有利的条件。
    1958年和1959年，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，化学工业有了巨大的跃进。两年来，国家对化学工业的投资，相当于第一个五年计划投资的两倍，几种主要产品增产的数量，接近或者超过第一个五年计划增产的总数。1958年的生产总值比前一年增长了70％（不包括用土法生产的企业的产品和轻工业部门的化工产品），新产品增加将近七百种。1959年的生产总值，又将比1958年增长40％，几种主要产品的增长速度，大大超过了第一个五年计划的平均增长速度。今年的计划的完成，意味着第二个五年计划所列的八种化工产品中，有纯碱、烧碱、抗菌素等三种主要产品，将提前三年达到1962年的指标。
    1958年开始的化学工业大跃进，最突出的特点是“土”“洋”结合，大搞群众运动
    1958年开始的化学工业的大跃进，最生动最突出的特点，是大型企业、洋法生产的群众运动同小型企业、土法生产的群众运动的密切结合。“小土群”运动大大推进了化学工业的发展。这个群众运动之所以能够发动起来，是由于广大群众在总路线的鼓舞下，贯彻执行了党中央和毛泽东同志所提出的政治挂帅、解放思想、破除迷信、敢想敢说敢做的方针，贯彻执行了一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，贯彻执行了工业战线上大搞群众运动的方针，从而高度地发扬了广大群众的革命干劲，出现了一个群众性的化工“小土群”（有些是“小洋群”）的运动。群众的积极性，打破了办化学工业的神秘观点，他们很少向国家要钱，自力更生地在短短几个月内办起了大量的小型土法化工厂。像新疆、云南、贵州、青海、内蒙古等过去化学工业基础很差，或者甚至没有什么化学工业的地区，依靠群众的积极性，也举办了很多小型化工厂。在我国广大的农村，从专区、县到人民公社，也举办了不少化工厂，这样就为我国化学工业的发展，开辟了一条新的道路。
    依靠群众办化工，能够办得多办得好，目前我国年产量达数十万吨的硫磺和重要的化工产品硝酸钾全都是依靠土法生产的
    事实证明，依靠群众办化学工业，不但能够办得多，而且可以办得好。例如，河南商丘县，利用当地的硝土作原料，办了一个化工厂，先是生产磷钾肥料，使用结果肥效很好，大大鼓舞了群众的热情。于是他们进一步综合利用硝土，生产了硝酸钾、氯化钾、氯化镁、硝盐、盐酸等产品。这个厂没有一个技术人员，但经过刻苦钻研，终于把硝酸钾的纯度提高到99.94％。四川大邑县，几个月以内办起了十个小型化工厂，先后试制成功四十八种化工产品，其中钙镁磷肥、硫酸、纯碱、畜用土霉素、醋酸、葡萄糖等二十四种产品已经成批生产，预计今年就可以收回十个厂的全部投资。象商丘、大邑这样的例子，并不是个别的。全国许多地方已经办起来的化工“小土群”，经过整顿，走上了巩固发展的道路，它们对今后发展化工“小土群”起着示范的作用。
    大搞化工“小土群”的运动，是在农业生产大跃进和全民办工业的形势下出现的。化工“小土群”发展的结果，又反过来促进了农业和其他地方工业的大跃进。去年各地生产的土化肥和土农药，相当地满足了当时农业的迫切需要，土法生产的酸、碱在一定程度内满足了当地的需要。湖北省土法生产的硫酸，主要用于化学肥料。福建永春用土法生产的硫酸提炼金属。新疆用土法生产的硫酸精炼石油。许多地方用土法生产的硫酸来冲电瓶，保证了汽车的行驶。硫磺广泛用于医药、橡胶、农药、轻工等部门，目前我国硫磺的年产量达到数十万吨，全部是用土法生产的。硝酸钾是一种重要的化工产品，它用于国防、尖端和许多工业部门，并且大量出口支援兄弟国家。这种重要产品，也是全部依靠土法来进行生产的。辽宁省中小城市所需要的盐酸，大部分靠土法生产供应。贵州省遵义市土法生产的电解烧碱，保证了当地肥皂生产的需要。今年上半年全国土法生产的化肥，据十六个省、市不完全的统计，约有三百万吨。今年上半年依靠小型化工厂生产了不少化工原料，如硫酸、纯碱、烧碱、硝酸和盐酸等等。在当前化工原料不足的情况下，土法、洋法或土洋结合的小型企业的生产给大中企业的生产作了重要的补充，这对于满足社会的急需，特别是对于满足农业和地方工业的需要，是有重大的意义的。
    大搞化工“小土群”，培养了大批的化工技术力量。凡是举办“小土群”的地方，都培养了一批具有初步化工知识的工人。一年来，各地经过举办“小土群”而培养出来的技术工人，据不完全的统计，有三万二千多名，这个数字还不包括各地派出去实习的人数。这支技术力量，对于我国化学工业今后的迅速发展，必将发挥重大的作用。
    在去年大搞化工“小土群”的形势下，化工部曾经派了很多工作组，到各省、市、自治区，推广了七十九种化工产品的小型土法生产。一年多来的实践证明，七十九种产品中，除少数产品外，大多数是在生产技术上可以或者已经过了关的，同时，许多地方在实践中对小型工厂的设计，又作了因地制宜的修改，使得许多“小土群”的设计趋于完善。目前有很多小型厂，根据生产的要求，开始向“小洋群”发展，在用人力过多的地方，已开始采用简单的机器；对于人工不易控制的生产过程，已开始采用简单的仪表；对于原料、燃料的供应一般都作了调整，从而避免了长途的运输；必要的生产管理和技术管理也逐步建立起来了。从一年多来的实践中，各地也取得了一些生产技术管理经验，培养了一批管理干部，这就为今后进一步大搞化工“小土群”作了必要的技术准备和组织准备。
    由于大搞化工“小土群”的群众运动，几个月内就在全国广大地区建立了大量小型化工厂
    从去年开始发展的化工“小土群”运动的成绩是巨大的。如果没有去年大搞化工“小土群”的群众运动，要想在短短几个月内，在全国广大地区建立大量的小型化工厂，是不可能的。依靠广大群众办化学工业，局面必然是轰轰烈烈，我国化学工业也就一定能够高速度地发展。化工“小土群”运动的巨大成就，充分证明了党中央和毛泽东同志所提出的中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中型企业、小型企业并举，洋法生产和土法生产并举的方针的完全正确，“两条腿走路”的方针的贯彻执行，正是高速度发展我国化学工业的根本道路。
    右倾机会主义分子和有右倾思想的同志，对大搞“小土群”是不赞成的，他们一直是泼冷水，吹冷空气，说什么化学工业技术复杂，不宜由群众来办，不能搞“小土群”。他们对大搞“小土群”所取得的巨大成就视而不见，听而不闻；他们抓住个别的、暂时的缺点加以夸大，大肆宣传，散播消极气氛。有些“小土群”开始生产时，由于设计不完善、工人操作不熟练，生产不正常，于是他们就断言，“小土群”过不了技术关。有些“小土群”刚办起来的时候，由于经营管理没有经验，成本较高，他们就断言，“小土群”过不了经济关。在他们看来，去年大搞化工“小土群”是“作用不大”，或者“根本没有作用”，是“很大的失败”，是“得不偿失”。这种右倾思想，在一个时期内也曾影响了一部分过去对办“小土群”比较积极的同志，他们也对大搞“小土群”发生了怀疑、动摇，因此，在今年的一个短时期内，刮了那么一股风，好像去年大搞“小土群”搞错了，“小土群”吃不开了似的。
    化工“小土群”能不能过技术关呢？所谓不能过技术关，无非是指一部分小型厂生产不正常。事实上，我们一年来推广采用小型土法和小型洋法生产的化工产品，大多数在技术上是成熟的，是可以过关的。有些生产技术上还不成熟的产品，除进行试验外，已停止推广。技术上成熟的产品，有少数在开始生产时不够正常，主要是由于缺少必要的技术工人，一时不能熟练地掌握操作，或者是由于有些地方所采用的设备，东拼西凑，不完全符合生产要求，以致不能很好掌握生产过程中某些化学反应。我们认为应当把化工“小土群”过技术关和经济关，当作是一个发展的过程。我们相信，问题是可以逐步解决的，绝大多数“小土群”的生产是能够逐步正常起来的。拿土法生产硫酸来说，同样的生产方法，有的地方生产很正常，有的地方生产很不正常，很明显，这并不是“小土群”根本过不了关，而只是生产中的具体问题还没有得到妥善的解决。
