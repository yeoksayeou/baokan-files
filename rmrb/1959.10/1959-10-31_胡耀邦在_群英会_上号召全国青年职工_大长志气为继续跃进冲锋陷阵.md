Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, delivered a speech at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade, titled "Boost Morale and Charge Forward for the Continued Leap Forward of the Motherland."

Hu Yaobang first said that the Chinese working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition and high class consciousness, is worthy of being the elder brother of the working people of our country and is the most determined and active backbone force in building socialism. In the socialist construction of the motherland, especially in the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese working class has made great contributions. The young people of our country express infinite respect to the Chinese working class, which is advancing courageously under the banner of the General Line.

Hu Yaobang said that due to the education of the Party and the encouragement and influence of advanced elements in our country, a new upsurge of socialist labor emulation is rising among the younger generation of the working class in our country, forming a hot tide of charging forward for the Great Leap Forward of the motherland. According to incomplete statistics from twenty provinces and cities, more than 7.5 million young workers have participated in the movement to enter 1960 at high speed. As of October 20th, 338,893 young workers and 10,349 youth collectives had already entered 1960. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen provinces and cities, a total of more than 1,646,000 young workers and more than 1,900 youth collectives participated in activities to help the backward catch up with the advanced. 92,751 people have made significant achievements, helping 26,135 backward people reach the level of advanced producers and helping more than 110,000 young workers improve their production. According to incomplete statistics from nineteen provinces and cities, young workers have put forward a total of 6,259,063 innovation proposals in the past six months, of which 3,028,683 have been implemented. According to incomplete statistics from eleven provinces and cities, more than 14,000 shock brigades composed of more than 130,000 people have been formed, and more than 14,900 major production bottlenecks have been overcome in the past six months. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen provinces and cities, young workers have saved and recovered more than 550,000 tons of steel and more than 6,100 tons of metals such as copper and aluminum in the past six months. There are 1,160 young people under the age of 25 and 2,279 under the age of 28 attending this Heroes Conference, which also reflects that the vast number of young workers in our country are advancing courageously together with the older generation. How can we describe the mental state of the vast number of young activists in our country during the Great Leap Forward? They put it well themselves: their thinking is "Liberation Brand," their drive is "Forever Brand," and their determination is "Invincible Brand."

Hu Yaobang pointed out that the reason why our motherland can advance so rapidly is because our Party and Chairman Mao have formulated a completely correct General Line for building socialism and a completely correct set of policies for building socialism. The Party's General Line for socialist construction embodies the greatest and most fundamental interests of the people of our country and is the lifeline of our country. Our enemies desperately slander the General Line, and all right-leaning opportunists who attempt to return to the capitalist road desperately attack the General Line. The reason lies here. Therefore, by thoroughly criticizing right-leaning ideas, boosting morale, and resolutely implementing the General Line in all aspects, in all places, and at all times, we will surely move from victory to greater victory.

Hu Yaobang called on young workers across the country to always listen to the Party and continuously improve their socialist consciousness. He said that the reason why our motherland can advance so rapidly is also because our Party has carried out tremendous political and ideological education among the people of our country. The Party's education enables us to distinguish between right and wrong, identify two roads, and correctly handle contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. The Party's education enables us to stand tall, see far, and correctly treat the relationship between temporary interests and long-term interests, partial interests and overall interests, and individual interests and collective interests. The Party's education enables us to dare to break with the old, break superstitions, liberate our minds, and bravely and realistically open up paths for new socialist things. The Party's education is making us step by step the noblest people in history, working without conditions, not picking and choosing work; enduring hardship first and enjoying benefits later; going wherever there are difficulties. Hu Yaobang said that we young people should always keep these teachings of the Party in mind, resolutely implement political command, arm ourselves with the idea of continuous revolution, further promote the communist spirit, and keep pushing our great cause forward.

Hu Yaobang then said that Vice Chairman Zhu and Vice Premier Li, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, put forward new and great tasks to us at this conference, that is, not only to make our industry continue to leap forward in the coming years, but also to require our industry to vigorously support agriculture and strive to achieve the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of our agriculture. This requires the younger generation of the working class in our country to more heroically contribute their strength and leap forward together with the older generation. How can young comrades better contribute their strength? The most important thing at present is: First, we must resolutely listen to the Party, dare to think and dare to act, always maintain soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit, and constantly fight against various right-leaning conservative ideas. Second, we must actively participate in socialist labor emulation, strive to master advanced experience and advanced technology, and better combine hard work and smart work. Third, all young activists must be determined to never be complacent, and like many old heroes present here, constantly advance and become more advanced. Fourth, all comrades who are still in a backward state must be determined to catch up quickly, strive for the top, and improve themselves to an advanced level, like many rising stars present here.

Hu Yaobang said that it should be said that the vast majority of young comrades have this desire. However, there are often some young comrades who cannot connect their wishes and determination, for example: only care about working and do not pay attention to learning; feel that they are almost there when they have achieved results; and feel a little pessimistic and discouraged when they fall behind. This requires the older generation of the working class to help them greatly. In order to help the younger generation, we hope that the older generation of comrades will not only impart their technology and experience to them, but also strictly demand them politically and ideologically. What is strict political and ideological requirement? The most important thing is to cultivate their ambition. We must foster the ambition of hard work and thrift in building the country; we must foster the ambition of raising our country's industry, agriculture, and science and technology to the most advanced level in the world; we must foster the ambition of contributing all our strength to socialism and communism; we must foster the ambition of serving the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world with all our energy.

Hu Yaobang finally said that we believe that relying on the Party's continuous education, relying on the older generation's kind help, and relying on the young people's own unremitting efforts, more and more young people will become pioneers of the motherland's Great Leap Forward, and our entire young generation will better grow into a shock force that is infinitely loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the socialist cause.

    胡耀邦在“群英会”上号召全国青年职工
    大长志气为继续跃进冲锋陷阵
    新华社30日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦，30日在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上以“大长志气，为祖国的继续跃进而冲锋陷阵”为题，作了讲话。
    胡耀邦首先说，具有光荣革命传统和高度阶级觉悟的我国工人阶级，不愧是我国劳动人民的老大哥，是建设社会主义最坚决最积极的骨干力量。在祖国的社会主义建设中，特别是在大跃进中，中国工人阶级作出了伟大的贡献。我国青年对高举总路线红旗奋勇前进的我国工人阶级，表示无限的敬意。
    胡耀邦说，由于党的教育，由于我国先进分子的鼓舞和影响，我国工人阶级中的年轻一代，在轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛的新高潮中，兴起了一个为祖国大跃进而冲锋陷阵的热潮。据二十个省、市不完全的统计，已经有七百五十余万名青年职工参加了高速度跨进1960年的运动，到10月20日为止，已经有三十三万八千八百九十三名青工和一万零三百四十九个青年集体跨进了1960年。据十三个省、市不完全的统计，参加帮落后赶先进活动的共有一百六十四万六千多名青年职工和一千九百多个青年集体，有九万二千七百五十一人已经做出了显著的成绩，他们共帮助了二万六千一百三十五名落后者达到了先进生产者的水平，帮助了十一万多名青工提高了生产。据十九个省、市不完全的统计，近半年来，青年职工共提出革新建议六百二十五万九千零六十三件，已经实现了三百零二万八千六百八十三件。据十一个省、市不完全的统计，有十三万多人参加组成的各种攻关键的突击队一万四千多个，半年来攻下了重大的生产关键一万四千九百余个。据十四个省、市不完全的统计，近半年来，青年职工节约、回收钢铁材料五十五万多吨，铜、铝等金属六千一百多吨。出席这次群英大会的二十五岁以下的青年，有一千一百六十人，二十八岁以下的有二千二百七十九人，这也反映了我国广大青年职工正在同老一辈一道奋勇前进。用什么来表明我国广大青年积极分子在祖国大跃进中的精神状态呢？他们自己说得好，他们的思想是“解放牌”，干劲是“永久牌”，决心是“无敌牌”。
    胡耀邦指出，我们的祖国之所以能够这样飞跃地前进，是由于我们的党和毛主席给我们制定了一条完全正确的建设社会主义的总路线和一套完全正确的建设社会主义的方针。党的社会主义建设总路线，体现着我国人民的最大的和最根本的利益，是我们的命根子。我们的敌人拚命诬蔑总路线，一切企图回到资本主义道路上的右倾机会主义分子拚命攻击总路线，道理也就在这里。因此，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，在一切方面，在所有地方，在任何时候，坚决贯彻总路线，我们就一定会从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    胡耀邦号召全国青年职工要永远听党的话，不断提高社会主义觉悟。他说，我们的祖国之所以能够这样飞跃地前进，还因为我们党对我国人民进行了巨大的政治思想教育。党的教育使我们能够分清大是大非，辨明两条道路，正确处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。党的教育使我们站得高，看得远，能够正确对待暂时利益和长远利益、局部利益和整体利益、个人利益和集体利益的关系。党的教育使我们敢于同旧的东西决裂，破除迷信、解放思想，勇敢地而又实事求是地为社会主义的新事物开辟道路。党的教育使我们一步步地成为历史上最高尚的人，工作不讲条件，干活不挑轻重；吃苦在先，得利在后；那里有困难，就到那里去。胡耀邦说，我们青年应该时刻牢记党的这些教导，坚决实行政治挂帅，用不断革命的思想武装自己，更大地发扬共产主义精神，把我们的伟大事业，一直推向前进。
    胡耀邦接着说，朱副主席和李副总理代表党中央，在这次大会上向我们提出了新的伟大的任务，这就是不但要使我国工业在今后的年份里继续跃进，而且要求我国工业大力支援农业，努力争取实现我国农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化。这就要求我国工人阶级年轻的一代，更英勇地贡献自己的力量，同老一辈一道，共同跃进。青年同志们怎样才能更好地贡献自己的力量呢？当前最重要的，第一，就是要坚决听党的话，敢想敢干，永远保持冲天的革命干劲和旺盛的革命斗志，不断地同各种右倾保守思想作斗争。第二，就是要积极投入社会主义劳动竞赛，努力掌握先进经验和先进技术，把苦干和巧干更好地结合起来。第三，就是一切青年积极分子都要下定决心，永不自满，像在座的许多老英雄一样，不断前进，先进再先进。第四，就是一切还处在落后状态的同志，都要下定决心，像在座的许多后起之秀一样，奋起直追，力争上游，把自己提高到先进的水平上来。
    胡耀邦说，应该说，绝大多数的青年同志都是有这种愿望的。但是，往往有这样一些青年同志，他们把愿望和决心连结不起来，比如：只顾干，不注意学；有了成绩，就觉得差不多了；落后了，就有点悲观泄气。这就要求工人阶级的老一辈大力帮助他们。为了帮助年轻的一代，我们希望，老一辈同志不但要把技术和经验传授给他们，还要在政治上思想上严格地要求他们。什么是政治上思想上的严格要求呢？最重要的，就是要他们长志气。要长艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的志气；要长把我国的工业、农业和科学技术提高到世界上最先进水平的志气；要长把全部力量贡献给社会主义和共产主义的志气；要长以毕生精力为全国人民和为全世界人民服务的志气。
    胡耀邦最后说，我们相信，依靠党的不断教育，依靠老一辈的亲切帮助，还依靠青年自己不懈的努力，愈来愈多的青年一定会成为祖国大跃进的尖兵，我国整个青年一代，一定会更好地成长为一支无限忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于社会主义事业的突击部队。
