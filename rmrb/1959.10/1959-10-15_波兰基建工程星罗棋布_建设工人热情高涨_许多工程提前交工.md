Warsaw Dispatch: Polish basic construction projects are scattered throughout the country. Currently, there are dozens of large-scale projects under expansion and construction. The key expansion projects in Poland now include the Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta, the Skawina Aluminum Plant, the Szczecin Shipyard, and more than a dozen mines and power stations. The key new construction projects include the Warsaw High-Quality Aluminum Plant, the Turów Power Station, the Sulfur Plant, the Coal Gas Chemical Plant, the Iron Smelting Plant, and nearly twenty light industrial factories.

The basic construction projects currently under construction in Poland are mainly concentrated in the new industrial areas where industrial raw materials are produced, such as the Konin-Turoszów lignite area, the Górnik bituminous coal area, the Tarnobrzeg sulfur area, the Głogów copper mining area, and the Lubaczów natural gas area.

Some of the construction projects started this year are located in previously underdeveloped provinces, in order to change the unbalanced distribution of productive forces in various regions and develop backward areas.

The progress of basic construction projects in various regions is very rapid. To date, large factories such as the Oświęcim Synthetic Rubber Plant and the Bagne Copper Smelting Plant have been put into production. The Tarnobrzeg Sulfur Plant has completed the plant's railway line and built auxiliary workshops.

Due to the implementation of automated construction and prefabrication methods in various regions, coupled with the soaring enthusiasm of construction workers, basic construction projects are completed ahead of schedule. In order to better leverage investment results, many factories immediately try to start production after a portion of them are completed. For example, the Lelice Steel Wire Plant has only completed one-third of its production capacity, but this factory has already provided the country with a large number of products. (Photo attached)

The "Oświęcim" Synthetic Rubber Plant in Poland, which produces synthetic rubber, is very large, including fifty-five independent manufacturing plants. This is a corner of the ethylene benzene workshop.

　　波兰基建工程星罗棋布
    建设工人热情高涨　许多工程提前交工
    本报华沙14日电　波兰基本建设工程遍布全国，目前正在扩建和兴建的大型工程项目就有几十个。波兰现在扩建的重点工程包括诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业，斯卡维纳制铝厂，什才新的造船厂以及矿井、发电站各十余座。正在新建的重点工程包括华沙优质铝厂，图鲁夫发电站，硫磺厂，煤气化学厂，炼铁厂以及近二十座轻工业工厂等。
    波兰正在施工的基本建设工程主要集中在工业原料产地的新工业区内，如：康宁—特尔劳褐煤区，古尼克石煤区，塔尔诺格的硫磺区，格罗哥的铜矿区，留巴斯佐的天然气煤气区等。
    今年兴建的一些工程项目建立在先前的落后省区，为的是改变各地生产力配置不平衡状况，发展落后地区。
    各地基本建设的工程进度都很迅速，迄今为止已有奥斯威辛合成橡胶厂，巴格尼察炼铜厂等大厂投入生产，塔尔诺格硫磺厂已修好全厂的铁路线，建成了辅助性车间。
    由于各地实行自动化施工和预置配件等方法，再加上建设工人高涨的劳动热情，基本建设工程都提前完成预定进度计划。为了更好地发挥投资效果，许多工厂在建成一部分后立即设法开始生产，如累利尼察钢丝厂目前只建成了生产能力的三分之一，但这个工厂已经向国家提供大量的产品。（附图片）
