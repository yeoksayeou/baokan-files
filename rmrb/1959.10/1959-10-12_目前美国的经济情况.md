　　Current Economic Situation in the United States

    Steel strike causes economic downturn

    On July 15th of this year, a massive steel strike broke out in the United States. Prior to this, the stock replenishment movement triggered by fears of a steel strike and the wave of credit purchases caused by loose monetary policy had created a speculative, abnormal "boom" in the American economy. The industrial production index (1947-1949 being 100, same below) reached as high as 155 in June of this year, exceeding the pre-crisis peak by more than 9 points. The gross national product for the second quarter of this year also reached a high of $484.5 billion, $38.9 billion higher than the pre-crisis peak in the third quarter of 1957.

    The strike has left the American steel industry practically at a standstill. The operating rate of the steel industry dropped from 90% in June to 42% in July and 12% in August. Under the influence of the strike, the U.S. industrial and mining production index also began to decline, from 155 in June to 153 in July and 149 in August. So far, the main factors causing the decline in the overall production index are the shutdown of the steel industry itself and the sharp decline in the production of its important raw materials, iron ore and coal. In addition, the copper miners' strike in August and the shutdown and remodeling of the automobile industry also had a certain impact. As a result of the large-scale stockpiling of steel in the past few months, industrial sectors that use steel as their main raw material have not yet been severely directly affected. However, if the strike continues to be unresolved, many durable goods industries will generally experience shutdowns due to lack of materials by mid-October, and the shortage of steel will approach the crisis stage by the end of October, according to American press estimates. The non-durable goods industries and service sectors will also be gradually adversely affected as steel workers cannot get wages and unemployment increases in other industrial sectors. Currently, 125,000 railway workers and coal miners have become unemployed due to the steel strike, and the number of workers who will become unemployed due to steel shortages will inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, given the current situation, the U.S. industrial production index will likely continue to decline in September and October. If the strike continues to be unresolved, its decline will obviously become greater and greater.

    Signs of more serious overproduction of commodities

    Now the question is what changes will the American economy bring about after the end of the strike. To answer this question, we must not only look at how long this strike will last and how great its impact will be, but also whether the factors that have promoted economic growth in the past few months are reliable and whether they will continue to play a role in the future.

    A simple look at U.S. official statistics reveals how much the rapid increase in inventories in the first half of this year, especially in the second quarter, has contributed to the abnormal rise of the U.S. economy. In the first quarter of this year, business inventories rose at an annual rate of 6.1 billion yuan, and in the second quarter, they increased even more sharply to an annual rate of 10.4 billion yuan, 4.3 billion yuan faster than in the first quarter. However, the annual rate figure for the U.S. gross national product increased by only 13.1 billion yuan in the first quarter of this year, and only 14.3 billion yuan more than in the first quarter in the second quarter. Obviously, the increase in inventories accounted for a large proportion. The increase in inventories is of course due to production exceeding consumption, and is in fact a manifestation of overproduction, which will sooner or later become a factor that promotes a decline in production. In July of this year, U.S. business inventories reached a high of $89.8 billion, only $1.5 billion lower than the excessive level before the crisis, which proves that it is not far from the saturation point. What's more, the violent growth of this inventory is mainly caused by steel users desperately hoarding steel for fear of a steel strike and the overproduction of certain commodities that cannot be sold. At present, the replenishment of steel inventories has turned to contraction due to the strike, but other commodities are still rising. For example, steel inventories basically stopped rising in July, but retail and wholesale inventories continued to increase, and overall, the inventory level still rose at an annual rate of 6 billion yuan in July. At the end of August, U.S.-made automobile inventories reached an unprecedented peak of 965,000 vehicles, an increase of almost 100,000 vehicles compared to July. Although there was a seasonal decline in September due to model changes and shutdowns, it was still more than 200,000 vehicles higher than in September 1958. In addition, inventories of gasoline, non-ferrous metals, etc. have also increased counter-seasonally due to sluggish sales. This shows that although the U.S. production has increased significantly this year, it has far exceeded the market capacity, and a large part of it is actually滞留在 (stuck) in warehouses and sales networks, and the overproduction of commodities is showing signs of becoming more and more serious. Therefore, although there may be another short-term inventory replenishment movement after the resumption of steel production, its scale and sustainability cannot be overestimated. If the replenishment is overdone, it is likely to cause a contraction of inventories, thereby causing another decline in production.

    The expansion of consumer credit

    American bourgeois newspapers and economists tirelessly want us to believe that the increase in people's consumption has played a decisive role in the recent production rebound. It is true that in the second quarter of this year, total national consumption reached 311.2 billion yuan (annual rate figure), an increase of 7.3 billion yuan compared to the first quarter, of which automobiles accounted for 2 billion yuan, and household appliances and clothing accounted for about 1 billion yuan each. Due to buying too many things, the proportion of savings in personal income after taxes has dropped from 8% two years ago to the current 7%. At the same time, consumers' debts are rising at an unprecedented rate, reaching a huge annual rate of 6 billion yuan in the second quarter. Therefore, the vast majority of the increase in residents' consumption in the second quarter of this year was purchased on credit. In 1955, although consumer credit increased rapidly, it was mainly concentrated in automobiles and other durable consumer goods, with a relatively small scope. At present, the scope of consumer credit is getting larger and larger, and it is even used to purchase daily necessities, food, travel bills, etc. A few months ago, major American banks used huge advertisements to promote a personal consumer credit, anyone can freely use 15%-20% of their annual income by filling out a form and indicating how much money they earn each year, without collateral, and repaying in installments, with interest sometimes as high as 12%. This type of consumer credit is not only very dangerous, but also makes the impact of monetary policy on the sales of various industries greater and greater. Because all industries are striving for sales on credit, the sales of automobiles and other durable consumer goods that mainly rely on credit in the past will inevitably be adversely affected. What's more, the position of American commercial banks is getting tighter and tighter, and interest rates are constantly increasing, so it is undoubtedly difficult to further support such a large-scale credit purchase movement. At the same time, the steel strike has also greatly impacted personal income. It can be seen that it is unlikely that the consumption growth rate of the second quarter of this year can be maintained in the future.

    Factors stimulating the economy are trending in the opposite direction

    Although American bourgeois newspapers have recently been desperately promoting that a new investment upsurge has already arrived. But as it stands, investment does not have a very large stimulating effect on production. According to recent official estimates, investment in plant and equipment by the U.S. business community reached 32.5 billion yuan in the second quarter of this year, an increase of about 1.9 billion yuan compared to the first quarter, and it is estimated that it will increase to 35.3 billion yuan in the fourth quarter (the above are all annual rate quarterly figures). The estimate for the entire year of 1959 is 33.3 billion yuan, an increase of about 9% compared to 1958. But it is still lower than in 1957. It can be seen that even according to official estimates, investment has not reached the extent that it can support a "prosperity". What's more, after this crisis, the problem of excess production capacity in the United States has not been resolved, and the operating rate of many important products is still very low. Although steel inventory replenishment reached a fever pitch at the beginning of this year, the operating rate of steel has never been higher than 95%, and its normal operating rate is generally estimated to be only around 70%. The situation for non-ferrous metals, automobiles, gasoline, chemicals, etc. is also the same. Therefore, although the level of investment may continue to increase in the future due to increasingly acute competition and relatively high profits, the scale will not be very large, and it is unlikely that its strength can be relied upon to support another "prosperity".

    Although the level of construction this year is relatively high and has played a significant role in this production increase, the future prospects are not optimistic. The number of non-agricultural housing starts reached a high level of 1.43 million units per year in April of this year, and then began to slowly decline, decreasing to an annual rate of 1.34 million units in August, with residential construction decreasing more. According to official U.S. estimates, the actual annual housing demand in the United States is roughly between 1 million and 1.2 million units, so the current high number of starts is far excessive and cannot be maintained for long. Moreover, interest rates are getting higher and higher, and the statutory mortgage rates guaranteed by the government can no longer attract speculative capital, so residential construction is bound to fall back in the next few months of this year. Because Congress has not fully satisfied the government's request to increase gasoline taxes, highway construction plans seem to be slowing down. Obviously, the stimulating effect of the construction industry on the economy is constantly shrinking and may even become a factor that promotes a decline in production.

    The temporary easing of last year's agricultural crisis slightly improved the sales of agricultural machinery and general rural consumer goods. However, last year's bumper harvest has left American agriculture facing another serious surplus crisis. Official estimates indicate that this year's agricultural harvest is only 3% less than last year, but still 8% higher than any previous year. At present, the government's stored surplus agricultural products are close to 10 billion U.S. dollars, farmers' income is about 10% less than last year, and agricultural product prices are constantly declining. Therefore, it is no longer possible to expect agriculture to continue to stimulate the economy in the future.

    It can be seen that the rapid rise in production in the past few months is mainly not due to the increase in normal demand for consumer goods and investment, but to a large extent is stimulated by the abnormal increase in inventories and consumer credit. This foundation is of course unstable. Moreover, all these temporary factors that stimulate the economy are currently trending in the opposite direction. Not only that, but the American economy also faces many new unsettling factors today, which may have adverse effects on it at any time.

    Several unfavorable conditions

    First, the United States is currently facing a serious fiscal and financial crisis. In fiscal year 1959, the federal government's budget deficit reached as high as 12.5 billion yuan, and the total amount of public debt has now exceeded 290 billion U.S. dollars. It is estimated that the U.S. federal government will issue and exchange new public debt of up to 85 billion U.S. dollars in the next twelve months. Savings bonds are also taking in more and selling less. Since May of this year, the federal government has been completely unable to issue or exchange new long-term public debt due to the legal maximum interest rate limit, and has almost entirely maintained itself by issuing short-term public debt and treasury bills. Inflation is therefore becoming more and more serious. Recently, the interest rate on 91-day treasury bills has risen sharply from 3% in early August to 3.979%, the interest rate on top-rated corporate bonds is as high as 5%, the bank lending rate has increased to 5% since September 1, and the bank discount rate has also increased to 4%, reaching an unprecedented peak since the war. The tightening of monetary policy and the rise in interest rates have greatly affected consumer credit and housing mortgages, which will inevitably make it difficult to sell automobiles and housing. On the other hand, due to the crazy rise in stock prices, the average yield has recently fallen to 3%. In recent times, the speculative nature of stocks has become more and more obvious, with extremely large fluctuations up and down, and there is a possibility of a storm at any time.

    Second, in the face of increasingly serious inflation and government financial difficulties and a slight easing of the international situation, the expenditures of governments at all levels in the United States have recently shown a temporary trend of reduction. In the second half of 1958, expenditures by governments at all levels increased by approximately 5.4 billion U.S. dollars, that is, they rose at a rate of 10.8 billion yuan per year, but in the first half of this year, they only increased by a total of 1.2 billion yuan, of which federal government expenditures actually decreased by 300 million yuan. Official forecasts indicate that government expenditures may decrease by about 1 billion yuan in the second half of this year. If it is said that U.S. federal government spending was a major artificial factor stimulating economic growth last year, then this factor will temporarily turn into a minus sign this year.

    Third, the unemployment problem has not yet been resolved. Although the number of unemployed people in July and August showed a seasonal decline, decreasing from 3.98 million in June to 3.4 million in August, it did not decrease to the extent that a seasonal decline should have. As a result, its proportion of the labor force rose from 4.9% in June to 5.1% in July and 5.5% in August, while it was only 2.9% in 1953 and only 4.2% in 1956. The trend of the unemployment problem deepening with each crisis is becoming more and more obvious.

    Fourth, due to rising prices in the United States and the recovery of the economic strength of Western Europe, the United States' competitive strength in foreign markets is not as good as before. In the first half of this year, U.S. exports fell from 9 billion yuan in the first half of last year to 8.6 billion yuan, a decrease of about 4%, while imports increased from 6.3 billion yuan to 7.4 billion yuan in the same period, an increase of 18%. In June of this year, the United States actually experienced a trade deficit for the first time since the war. The narrowing of the trade surplus caused the United States to have a 3.4 billion yuan international balance of payments deficit last year, of which 2.3 billion yuan was paid for in gold outflows. In the first quarter of this year, the international balance of payments deficit was even higher at an annual rate of 3.7 billion yuan, and it is estimated that the full-year deficit will exceed 4 billion U.S. dollars. By the end of August of this year, the United States had lost another 1.075 billion U.S. dollars in gold, and the total gold reserves have now fallen to 19.3 billion U.S. dollars, the lowest level in 19 years. The reduction in exports and the sharp increase in imports are exerting pressure on the domestic market of U.S. domestic enterprises from two aspects. Taking the automobile industry as an example, automobile imports were negligible in 1954, with a total of only more than 20,000 vehicles, but this year they have increased sharply to more than 500,000 vehicles. At the same time, U.S. automobile exports have fallen sharply. In the first half of this year, foreign automobile imports increased by 72% compared to the same period last year, while U.S. automobile exports decreased by 12%. In the same period, steel imports increased by 123% compared to the same period last year, while exports decreased by 21%, cotton textile exports decreased by 16%, while imports increased by 27%. This trend in U.S. foreign trade will inevitably further exacerbate domestic overproduction, intensify market competition, and make the unemployment problem more difficult to resolve.

    The continuous decline in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and the increasing reduction of gold reserves have greatly damaged the international credit of the U.S. dollar, threatening its function as a world currency, thereby greatly weakening the international position of U.S. imperialism.

    The "boom" phase has a limited lifespan

    It can be seen that on the eve of the steel strike, although the American economy showed an abnormal "boom", judging from the current situation of some of the factors that promoted its rise, this "boom" has a trend of slowing down. Moreover, the tightening of monetary policy, the increasing financial difficulties, the reduction of government expenditures, the inability to solve the unemployment problem, the reduction of exports and the increase of imports, the outflow of gold, and the continuous deterioration of the international balance of payments crisis are all shadows hanging in front of the American economy. Recently, some American political economists have pointed out that, given the current situation, the United States may completely experience another crisis by 1961.

    However, although the steel strike has now become an important factor causing a sharp decline in U.S. production, a short-term increase in steel production may occur after the end of the strike, thereby promoting a temporary rebound in overall production. Nevertheless, judging from the above analysis, since the American economy today lacks normal factors sufficient to support another "prosperity", this "rebound" is obviously not sustainable. As the draft political resolution recently issued by the American Communist Party says, "Despite the current high level of production and employment, the economic prospects in the next year or two will still experience stagnation and recession, and the suffering that befell the working class in 1958 will reappear to a greater extent."

　　目前美国的经济情况
　　谢曜
    钢铁罢工造成经济回降
    今年7月15日，美国爆发了一次规模巨大的钢铁大罢工。在此以前由于害怕钢铁罢工而形成的存货添补运动和银根松滥引起的赊购浪潮，曾使美国经济出现了一次投机性的畸形“高涨”。工业生产指数（1947—1949为一百，下同）今年6月高达一百五十五，超过危机前最高水平达九点之多。今年第二季国民生产毛值也高达四千八百四十五亿美元，比危机前最高的1957年第三季还高出三百八十九亿美元。
    罢工使得美国钢铁业实际处于停工的状态。钢铁业的开工率从6月的90％降至7月的42％和8月的12％。在罢工影响之下，美国的工矿生产指数也开始回跌，从6月的一百五十五降至7月的一百五十三和8月的一百四十九。到目前为止，促使生产总指数下降的因素主要还是钢铁业本身的停工状态和它的重要原料铁矿和煤产量的急剧下降。此外，8月铜矿工人的罢工和汽车业的停工改型也有一定的影响。由于过去数月大量囤积钢铁的结果，以钢为主要原料的工业部门至今尚未受到严重的直接影响。但如罢工继续不解决的话，按美国报刊估计，许多耐用品工业在10月中旬将普遍发生停工待料情况，到10月底缺钢将接近危机的阶段。非耐用品工业部门和服务行业也势将逐渐因钢铁工人拿不到工资和其他工业部门失业增加而受到不利影响。目前已有十二万五千铁路工人和煤矿工人因钢铁罢工而失业，今后因缺钢停产而失业的工人势必日益众多。所以，以当前的情况来看，9、10两月美国的工业生产指数大致还将继续下降。罢工如继续不解决，它的下降幅度显然还将越来越大。
    商品生产过剩又有趋于严重迹象
    现在问题是罢工结束以后美国经济究竟会引起什么变化。要回答这个问题不但要看这次罢工将持续多久，影响有多大，而且还要看过去几个月来促使经济上升的那些因素是否可靠，今后会不会继续再起作用。
    只要简单地看一下美国的官方统计就可以知道，今年上半年、特别是第二季存货的急剧增加对美国经济的畸形上升起着多大的作用。今年第一季，工商业存货以年率六十一亿元的速度上升，第二季更剧增至以年率一百零四亿元的速度上升，比第一季又快了四十三亿元。但是，今年第一季美国国民生产毛值的年率数字仅增加一百三十一亿元，第二季也仅比第一季增加一百四十三亿元。显然，存货的增加占了很大的比重。存货的增加当然是由于生产量超过了消费量的结果，因而实际上是生产过剩的一种表现，它迟早会变成促使生产下降的因素。今年7月，美国的工商业存货已高达八百九十八亿美元，仅比危机前过高水平低十五亿元，由此可以证明它离开饱和点已经不远了。何况，这次存货的猛烈增长主要的是受用钢户害怕钢铁罢工而拚命囤钢和某些商品生产太多、销不出去而造成的。目前，钢铁存货的添补已因罢工而转向减缩，但其他商品还在继续上升。例如，7月钢铁存货基本上已停止上升，但零售和批发方面则继续在增加，总的来说，7月存货水平仍以年率六十亿元的速度上升。8月底，美国制造的汽车存货高达九十六万五千辆的空前高峰，比7月几乎增加了十万辆，9月虽因改型停工而有季节性的下降，但仍比1958年9月高出二十万辆以上。此外，如汽油、有色金属的存货也因滞销而存货有了反季节性的增加。由此可知，今年美国生产虽有较大提高，但已远超过市场的容量，其中有很大一部分实际上是滞留在仓库和销售网里面，商品的生产过剩又有日趋严重的迹象。因此，钢铁复工以后固然可能再来一次短期的存货添补运动，但它的规模和持久性都是不能过高估计的。要是添补过了头，接着就很可能造成存货的减缩，从而引起另一次生产的下降。
    消费信贷的膨胀
    美国资产阶级报刊和经济学家喋喋不休地要我们相信，最近的生产回升中人民消费量的增加是起了决定性作用的。不错，今年第二季国民总消费量达三千一百一十二亿元（年率数字），比第一季增加了七十三亿元，其中汽车占二十亿元，家庭用具和服装各占十亿元左右。由于购买太多的东西，储蓄占纳税后个人收入的比重从二年前的8％降至目前的7％。同时，消费者的负债正以空前的速度上升，第二季达年率六十亿元之巨。因此，今年第二季所增加的居民消费量中绝大部分是欠了债来购买的。1955年，消费者信贷虽然增加很快，但主要集中在汽车和其他耐用消费品方面，范围比较小。目前，消费信贷的范围越来越大，甚至用于购买日常用品、饮食、旅行账单等方面。数月前，美国各大银行用巨额广告推广一种个人消费者信贷，任何人只要填一张表，注明他每年赚多少钱，不需担保就可以自由动用他全年收入的15％—20％，分期偿还，利息有时高至12％。这种消费者信贷不但很危险，而且使银根的松紧对各业销路的影响面越来越大。由于各业都在争取赊购的销路，过去主要依靠赊购的汽车及其他耐用消费品的销路势必会受到不利的影响。何况，目前美国商业银行的头寸越来越紧，利率不断提高，要进一步支持这样一个大规模的赊购运动无疑是有困难的。同时，钢铁罢工也已使个人收入受到很大的打击。由此可知，今后要继续维持今年第二季那种消费增长速度是不大可能的。
    刺激经济的因素有走向反面的趋势
    尽管美国资产阶级报刊近来拼命宣传一个新投资高潮业已来临。但以目前而论，投资对生产的刺激作用却并不很大。按照最近官方估计，美国企业界的厂房设备投资今年第二季达三百二十五亿元，比第一季约增加十九亿元，第四季估计将增达三百五十三亿元（以上都是年率季度数字）。1959年全年估计为三百三十三亿元，约比1958年增加9％。但仍低于1957年。可见即使按照官方的估计，投资也没有达到足以支持一次“繁荣”的程度。何况，经过这次危机，美国的生产能力过剩问题并没有解决，许多重要产品的开工率仍然很低。今年初虽然钢的存货添补达到白热化的程度，钢的开工率也从没有高于95％，它的正常开工率一般估计仅在70％左右。有色金属、汽车、汽油、化学品等情况也是这样。因此，投资的水平虽由于竞争日益尖锐化，利润比较高，在今后一个时期中可能会继续有所提高，但规模不会很大，要靠它的力量来支持另一次“繁荣”的可能性是不大的。
    今年建筑的水平虽然比较高，对这次生产上升起了不小的作用，但今后的前景也不能乐观。非农业的房屋动工数在今年4月达到每年一百四十三万幢的高度水平后便开始慢慢下降，8月便减为年率一百三十四万幢，其中下降较多的是住宅建筑。据美国官方估计，美国每年房屋的实际需要量大致在一百至一百二十万幢之间，因此目前的高度动工数远远过多，不可能长此维持下去的。而且，利率越来越高，政府担保的法定押款利率已不能再吸引游资，所以今年以后几个月住宅建筑是势必要回落。由于国会没有完全满足政府增加汽油税的要求，今后公路建筑计划看样子也有减缓的趋势。显然，建筑业对经济的刺激作用目前正在不断缩小，甚至可能变成一个促使生产下降的因素了。
    去年农业危机的暂时和缓曾使农业机器和一般农村消费品销路略有好转。但去年的大丰收已使美国农业面临另一次严重的过剩危机。官方估计今年的农业收成仅比去年减少3％，仍比以前任何一年高8％。目前，政府手中储存的剩余农产品已接近一百亿美元，农民的收入约比去年减少10％以上，农产品价格正在不断下降。因此，今后已不能再指望农业对经济继续起刺激作用了。
    可见，过去几个月生产的急剧上升主要并非由于对消费品和投资的正常需求的增加，而在颇大程度上是由于存货和消费者信贷的畸形增加所刺激起来的。这种基础当然是不稳固的。而且，所有这些暂时刺激经济的因素目前都有走到它的反面去的趋势。不但如此，美国经济今天还面临着许多新的不安因素，随时都会对它起不利的影响。
    几个不利条件
    首先，美国目前正面临一个严重的财政金融危机。1959年度，联邦政府的预算赤字高达一百二十五亿元，现在公债总额已超过二千九百亿美元，而在未来的十二个月内美国联邦政府新发、换发的公债估计高达八百五十亿元，储蓄公债也是收进的多，售出的少。今年5月以来，联邦政府因受法定最高利率的限制根本无法新发或换发长期公债，几乎全以发行短期公债和国库券来维持。通货膨胀因而越来越严重。最近，九十一天国库券的利率已从8月初的3％剧升至3.979％，头等的公司债的利率高达5％，银行放款利率9月1日起提高到5％，银行贴现率也已提高到4％，达到战后空前的高峰。银根抽紧和利率上升大大地影响了消费者信贷和房屋押款，势将使汽车和住宅的销路发生困难。另一方面，股票因疯狂上涨，最近平均收益率已降至3％。最近一个时期，股票的投机性越来越显著，上下波动极大，随时都有发生风潮的可能。
    其次，在通货膨胀和政府财政困难日趋严重而国际局势略有缓和倾向的情况下，美国各级政府的支出最近暂时有减缩的趋势。1958年下半年各级政府的开支约增加了五十四亿美元，也就是说，以每年一百零八亿元的速度上升，但今年上半年总共才增加了十二亿元，其中联邦政府的开支反而下降了三亿元，官方预测今年下半年政府开支可能会减少十亿元光景。要是说去年美国联邦政府开支是刺激经济上升的一个主要人为因素，那末今年这个因素将暂时转变为一个负号。
    第三，失业问题至今仍未解决。7月和8月的失业人数虽然出现季节性的下降，从6月的三百九十八万人降至8月的三百四十万人，但并没有减少到季节性下降应有的程度，结果它占劳动力的比重，却从6月的4.9％升至7月的5.1％和8月的5.5％，而1953年仅为2.9％，1956年也只有4.2％。失业问题随着每次危机而加深的趋势是越来越显著了。
    第四，由于美国物价上涨和西欧的经济力量恢复，美国在国外市场上的竞争力量已大不如前。今年上半年，美国的出口从去年上半年的九十亿元降到八十六亿元，约下降4％，而进口同期却从六十三亿元增至七十四亿元，即上升18％。今年6月，美国竟在战后第一次出现了贸易逆差。贸易顺差的缩小使美国去年出现了三十四亿元的国际收支逆差，其中有二十三亿元是以黄金外流支付的。今年第一季，国际收支逆差更高达年率三十七亿元，估计全年逆差将超过四十亿美元以上。到今年8月底为止，美国又失去十亿七千五百万美元的黄金，黄金总存量目前已降到一百九十三亿美元的十九年来最低水平。出口减少和进口剧增对美国国内企业的市场来说是受到两方面的压力。以汽车业为例，1954年汽车的进口是微不足道的，总共只有二万多辆，但今年已剧增到五十万辆以上。同时美国汽车的出口却大大下降。今年上半年，外国汽车进口比去年同期增加72％，而美国汽车出口则减少12％。同期钢的进口比去年同期增加123％，而出口反而下降21％，棉织品的出口减少16％，而进口却增加27％。美国对外贸易这种趋势必然会进一步使国内的生产过剩更加严重，市场的竞争更尖锐化，失业问题更加不容易解决。
    美元购买力的不断下降和黄金储存的日益缩减已使美元的国际信用遭受很大的打击，威胁到它作为世界通货的职能，从而大大削弱了美帝国主义的国际地位。
    “高涨”阶段寿命有限
    可见，在钢铁罢工的前夕，美国的经济虽然出现着一个畸形的“高涨”，但从促使它上升的一些因素的目前情况来看，这种“高涨”已有减缓的趋势。而且，银根的趋紧、财政的日益困难、政府开支的缩小、失业问题的不能解决、出口的减少和进口的增加、黄金外流和国际收支危机的不断恶化都是悬在美国经济面前的层层暗影。最近，有一部分美国政治经济学家已指出，按目前的情况来看，到1961年美国完全可能再发生一次危机。
    不过，钢铁罢工目前虽然已成为促使美国生产急剧下降的重要因素，但罢工结束后也可能会出现一个短期的钢铁增产，从而促使整个生产暂时有所回升。尽管如此，从上面的分析来看，由于今天美国经济缺少足以支持另一次“繁荣”的正常因素，这种“回升”显然是不能持久的。情况正如美共最近发表的政治决议草案中所说那样，“尽管有目前高度的生产与就业水平，最近一、二年内的经济前景仍将发生停滞和衰退，而1958年降临到工人阶级身上的苦难将以更大的程度重新出现。”
