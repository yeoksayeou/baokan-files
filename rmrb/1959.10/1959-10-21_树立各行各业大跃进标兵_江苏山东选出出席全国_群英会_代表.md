Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th – Jiangsu Province convened a conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade from October 11th to 17th. The more than 2,700 representatives attending the meeting firmly responded to the call of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, guaranteeing the early and overfulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan and making preparations for next year's production.

The conference selected 302 representatives to attend the National Conference of Heroes. Among them, 120 were representatives of advanced collectives. These advanced collectives and individuals came from all fronts of industry, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade throughout the province. Their common characteristics are daring to think and act, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, promoting the communist style of cooperation, helping each other, improving together, and excellently completing various production tasks. They are all glorious fighters defending the general line and pioneers of socialist construction.

Among the advanced collectives selected this time is the famous Zhang Jiazhong forging group of Xuzhou Heavy Machinery Plant. Since 1953, this group has completed 25 years and 7 months of work based on quotas, and has improved 567 sets of tooling, truly achieving innovation by everyone and creation by all. There is also the Suzhou Construction Engineering Company, which won the first prize of the Ministry of Construction Engineering for its advanced indicators. Since the beginning of this year, this company has continuously overcome right-leaning and slackening emotions in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and has continued to leap forward. Its various technical and economic indicators are leading the province. Among these advanced collectives are also units such as Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant's No. 3 blast furnace, Xuzhou Huaihai Steel Plant's No. 5 blast furnace, Changzhou Da Hongqi Steel Plant's No. 1 furnace, and Wuxi Qingfeng Textile Factory's ironmaking workshop. They have all achieved high quality, high output, low cost, and low coke ratio in production.

The advanced producers selected to attend the National Conference of Heroes are either old heroes and old models who have always been ahead of time and maintained their honor, or vanguards and pacesetters who have emerged in the Great Leap Forward. Among them are Zhang Ruiying, a female worker at Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory who has been rated as an advanced producer for five consecutive years and has always humbly learned from the experiences of others; Yang Houfa, a driller at Nanjing Radio Factory who carried out 530 technical innovations in 1958 alone and has since created automatic grinding machines and multi-head automatic drilling machines. There is also Guo Suozhen, a reeling female worker at Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory, who has been rated as an advanced producer for twelve consecutive times and whose yarn reeling output has consistently maintained the highest record in the factory since 1954. There is also Wang Siying, a salesperson at Wuxi No. 200 Department Store who has been diligently serving customers for six years.

In the Great Leap Forward in production, over 14,000 advanced units and over 160,000 advanced producers have emerged in Jiangsu Province's industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade systems. Now, on average, one out of every ten employees in the province is an advanced producer. The representatives attending the Provincial Conference of Heroes were selected from this powerful team of advanced producers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th – The 345 official representatives and specially invited representatives from Shandong Province to attend the National "Conference of Heroes" were recently selected. Among them, 128 are representatives of advanced collectives, 186 are advanced producers, and 31 are specially invited representatives. The delegation, led by Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is about to depart for Beijing.

In the process of selecting representatives for the "Conference of Heroes," all regions closely combined it with the summary and evaluation of the third quarter, commending the advanced, establishing models, and organizing competitions to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. They conscientiously summarized and publicized their advanced ideas, advanced deeds, and advanced experiences, so that workers in all walks of life could learn with content, catch up with goals, and surpass with direction. The representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers attending this National "Conference of Heroes" are all vanguards of the Great Leap Forward on all fronts of production and construction throughout the province and are role models for the vast number of workers to learn from. Among them are Xu Chenglong, a famous advanced producer who transformed from an ordinary carpenter into an engineer at Qingdao Comprehensive Wood Processing Plant; the steelmaking section of the No. 1 Workshop of Qingdao Bicycle Factory, which has earnestly implemented the Party's policy of walking on two legs, thereby achieving high quality, high output, and low cost; the No. 54 coal mining team of Zibo Hongshan Coal Mine, which has achieved large-area high yields for several years; Wang Jifang's group of Qingdao Construction Company, which has comprehensively overfulfilled its plans for eight consecutive years and has made significant progress in advancing towards mechanization; Qu Shuzi, a female lathe operator at Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant; Jinan Zhongdong Hostel, which is enthusiastic about serving passengers and has been very successful in running the hostel thriftily; and Qingdao Textile Wholesale Station, which is good at organizing factory-station cooperation and vigorously supports the leap forward in industrial production.

In order to welcome the convocation of the National "Conference of Heroes," the vast number of workers throughout the province have already widely launched activities to present generous gifts to the conference. They are determined to push the movement to increase production and practice economy to a greater climax, and ensure the completion of the annual plan half a month or more ahead of schedule.
