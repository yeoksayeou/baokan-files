Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Academician Bakulev, President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, stated in an article in "Medical Workers' Newspaper" on the 9th that scientists in the new scientific field of space medicine in the Soviet Union are successfully resolving a series of difficult problems concerning human flight into space.

The article said that experiments have proven that systematic flight training and specialized protective equipment can ensure that humans can withstand the effects of the sudden increase of eleven to fourteen times the Earth's gravitational pull (g-force) due to acceleration during the first few minutes of takeoff. Some tests have also shown that human tissue can completely withstand weightlessness lasting thirty to forty-five seconds. Experiments have also shown that in a state of continuous weightlessness, people can adapt to this state, maintain direction, and accurately adjust their movements.

Bakulev also said that solving the problem of being unaffected by ionizing radiation is very important because the higher a person ascends into space, the greater the impact of ionizing radiation. The instruments in the Soviet rocket system make it possible to measure ionization outside the atmosphere and study cosmic rays. The data obtained from this makes it possible for designers to design reliable protective equipment.

The Academician said that airtight cabins that can restore air can completely protect people from the extremely low air pressure in outer space. The problem of supplying oxygen during flight is also not a major difficulty, as liquid oxygen can be used, and asbestos treated in a salt base can be used to absorb carbon dioxide and water vapor. During long-term flights, plants that can absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen will play a very significant role.

Academician Bakulev concluded in the article that numerous experiments with animals have enabled scientists to solve a series of physiological problems during spaceflight in spacecraft and to create scientifically based methods to protect flight personnel and passengers from various harmful effects not encountered on the ground.

　　苏联宇宙医学研究进展顺利
    据新华社10日讯　苏联医学科学院院长巴库列夫院士9日在“医务工作者报”上发表的一篇文章中说，现在，苏联新的科学部门——宇宙医学的科学家们正在顺利地解决人类飞向宇宙的一系列困难问题。
    文章说，实验证明，系统的飞行训练和专门的防护设备都可以保证人能够忍受在起飞的几分钟里由于加速度而突然增大十一倍到十四倍的地心吸力（超重）的影响。一些试验还证明，人体组织完全能够忍受延续三十到四十五秒的失重状态。试验还证明，在不断失重的状况下，人能够适应这种状态，保持方向，准确地调整自己的动作。
    巴库列夫还说，解决不受电离辐射的影响的问题非常重要，因为人向宇宙上升得越高，电离辐射的影响也就越大。苏联火箭系统中的仪器使得有可能测量大气层以外的电离作用和研究宇宙线。由此而获得的资料使得设计师们有可能设计出可靠的防护设备。
    这位院士说，能使空气还原的密封舱，能够使人完全不受宇宙空间中极低气压的影响。在飞行中，供给氧气的问题也不是很大的困难了，可以用液体氧，还可以用在盐基中处理过的石棉来吸收二氧化碳和水蒸气。在长时期的飞行中，能够吸收二氧化碳和放出氧气的植物，将起非常大的作用。
    巴库列夫院士在文章中最后说，用动物所作的多次试验，使科学家们有可能解决在宇宙飞船中飞行时生理学上的一系列问题，并且创造出有科学根据的方法，使飞行人员和旅客免受地面上遇不到的各种有害影响。
