　　Make Full Use of Natural Resources, Develop Diversified Operations, and Prosper the Rural Economy
　　Happiness Reservoir's Method of "Using Water to Sustain Water" is Good
　　(Our dispatch) The management personnel of the Happiness Reservoir in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, fully utilize natural resources and implement the policy of "using water to sustain water." They focus on fish farming while simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. This points out new development prospects for prospering the rural economy and improving the management and maintenance of water conservancy projects. Construction of the Happiness Reservoir in Dongxiang County began in October 1957. After a winter and spring of hard work, a giant reservoir capable of irrigating more than 100,000 mu of farmland was born. After the Happiness Reservoir was handed over to the management personnel, they focused on fish farming and vigorously engaged in diversified operations, developing animal husbandry, agriculture, forestry, and processing industries according to local conditions. In the past, Dongxiang County had neither large rivers nor lakes, nor large-scale water conservancy projects, and aquatic products were extremely scarce. After the Happiness Reservoir was built, it became a fishery base last year. A large fish farm was established on the reservoir, and dozens of mu of fish ponds were opened outside the dam. In addition to raising several million fish fry, more than 5 million carp fry were hatched, which not only met the needs of fish farming in the reservoir, but also supplied the masses with a large number of fish fry. Now 4.9 million fish have been released into the reservoir. Over the past year, troops, government agencies, factories, and schools stationed in Dongxiang have continuously sent people to the reservoir to buy fish. It is estimated that this year, one million fresh fish can grow up and be released from the lake, which can generate an income of about 250,000 yuan. With the output of just one reservoir, each person in the county can eat an average of more than seven catties of fish.
　　In just over a year, the reservoir management personnel have used aquatic plants and wasteland around the reservoir to grow feed, and have already raised 144 pigs. One hundred pigs can be sold by the end of the year, and it is estimated that they can generate an income of 3,000 yuan. Fifty-six calves were purchased from Guangfeng County a year ago, costing only over 2,000 yuan, and now all have grown into fat and strong cattle, worth more than 10,000 yuan. The development of animal husbandry not only utilizes the abundant aquatic plants in the reservoir area, but also uses livestock manure to solve the problem of fish feed. Moreover, because the reservoir area is surrounded by crisscrossing mountains, it is a good base for forestry production. Over the past year, they have afforested more than 5,580 mu, and have also established a reservoir-run tree nursery. In addition, they also run a brick and tile factory, which can fire 24 kilns of bricks and tiles a year.
　　The future prospects of the reservoir are even brighter. According to preliminary plans, four pig farms and four cattle farms will be developed, a large number of sheep, bees, chickens, ducks, and geese will be raised, hundreds of mu of feed land will be developed, more than 16,000 mu of barren mountains will be afforested, dozens of mu of pear trees, peach trees, orange trees, and various kinds of fruit trees will be planted, and the area near the reservoir will be built into a happy and beautiful paradise.
　　In the past, the management, maintenance, and repair of water conservancy projects always relied solely on collecting water fees from the irrigated area to solve funding problems. The Happiness Reservoir management personnel have created a better method, which is to develop diversified operations and use water to sustain water. Under the unified leadership of the Irrigation Administration Bureau, they are divided into two groups. One group mainly engages in irrigation management work; the other group is mainly responsible for diversified operations with fish farming as the focus, divided into six production units: fish farm, pig raising group, cattle raising group, agricultural group, forestry group, and brick and tile factory. This year, the county party committee decided to assign a production team of more than 20 households and more than 100 mu of farmland near the dam to the management of the Reservoir Administration Bureau. In this way, their diversified operations such as fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry can be more fully developed. It is estimated that this year's diversified operations can generate a total income of about 300,000 yuan. After deducting about 100,000 yuan for various production investments and management expenses within the reservoir, there will be 200,000 yuan left for project repairs and expanded reproduction. If water fees are collected, the average cost per mu of benefited area would be 5 jiao, and 100,000 mu would only generate 50,000 yuan. In comparison, the Reservoir Administration Bureau's development of diversified operations can not only fully utilize production resources and accelerate the prosperity of the rural economy, but also reduce the burden on the communes, increase the income of commune members, and win the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of farmers. This method has been widely promoted by Dongxiang County in water conservancy projects with an irrigation area of more than 1,000 mu. It can be expected that this bright flower will surely bear fruitful results. (Attached picture)

　　充分利用自然资源　发展多种经营　繁荣农村经济
    幸福水库以水养水办法好
    本报讯　江西东乡县幸福水库管理人员充分利用自然资源，执行“以水养水”的方针，以养鱼为主，农林牧副渔同时发展，为繁荣农村经济、改进水库工程的管理和养护工作，指出了新的发展前景。1957年10月间，东乡县幸福水库开工兴建。经过一个冬春的战斗，一座能灌田十多万亩的巨型水库就诞生了。幸福水库交付给管理人员之后，他们就以养鱼为主，大搞多种经营，因地制宜地发展畜牧业、农业、林业和加工业。过去，东乡县既无大江大湖，又无大的水利工程，水产极少。幸福水库建成后，去年已变成一个渔业基地。水库上办起了一个大养鱼场，库坝外面开了几十亩鱼池，除了饲养几百万尾鱼种之外，还孵化鲤鱼鱼苗五百多万尾，既满足了库内养鱼的需要，又供应了群众大量的鱼种鱼苗。现在水库内已经放养鱼四百九十万尾。一年来，东乡的驻军、机关、工厂、学校，不断派人到水库去买鱼。今年预计能够长大出湖的鲜鱼可达一百万尾，约可收入二十五万元。仅仅一个水库的出产，全县每人平均即可吃到七斤多鱼。
    只一年多的时间，水库管理人员利用水草和水库周围废地种植的饲料，已养猪一百四十四头，年底可以出栏一百头，预计可收入三千元。一年前从广丰县买来小牛五十六头，只花了两千多元的成本，现在全部成长为肥壮的大牛，值一万多元。畜牧业的发展，既利用了库区水草丰盛之便，又可以利用牲畜的粪便解决养鱼的饵料。又由于库区四周全是纵横交错的山岭，是林业生产的良好基地。一年来，他们共造林五千五百八十余亩，还办了库办苗圃。另外，还办了一座砖瓦厂，一年可烧砖瓦二十四窑。
    水库今后的前途更加远大。据初步规划，要发展四个养猪场、四个养牛场，要大量养羊、养蜂、养鸡、鸭、鹅，要发展几百亩饲料地，要绿化一万六千多亩的荒山，要种植几十亩梨树、桃树、桔子树和各种各样的果树，要把水库附近建设成一个幸福美好的乐园。
    以往对于水利工程的管理、养护、维修，总是单纯依靠灌区收水费解决经费问题。幸福水库管理人员创造了更好的办法，就是开展多种经营，以水养水。他们在灌溉管理局的统一领导下，分成两班人马，一班主要从事灌溉管理工作；一班主要负责以养鱼为主的多种经营，分做养鱼场、养猪组、养牛组、农业组、林业组、砖瓦厂等六个生产单位。今年县委又决定把库坝附近的一个生产小队二十多户，一百多亩农田划归水库管理局管理，这样，他们的渔、农、牧、林等多种经营，就可以更充分地发展。今年预计多种经营共可收入三十万元左右，除去库内各项生产投资和管理费用约十万元以外，还有二十万元可以作为工程修理和扩大再生产之用。如果收水费，受益面积平均每亩以五角计，十万亩也不过收到五万元。比较起来，水库管理局开展多种经营既能够充分利用生产资源，加速繁荣农村经济，又可以减轻公社负担，增加社员收入，取得广大农民的热诚拥护。这种办法，东乡县已在灌溉千亩以上的水利工程上，普遍推广。可以预期，这朵鲜艳之花，必将结出丰硕之果。（附图片）
