    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: Yemen lodged a complaint with the United Nations Security Council on the 15th, accusing Britain of aggression against Yemeni territory.

    Yemen's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Kamal Abdul Rahim, in a letter to the President of the Security Council, accused Britain of attacking the Yemeni city of Beida on October 5th. Several residents were killed and property was damaged during the four-hour attack. British aircraft violated Yemeni airspace on October 4th, conducting provocative flights over Beida. Similar violations also occurred last month and earlier in October in the capital, Taiz, Beida, and Kataba.

    The letter stated that Britain's acts of aggression were completely unwarranted and threatened peace and security in the region.

    英国军队侵入也门领土
    也门向安理会提出控告
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：也门15日向联合国安全理事会控告英国对也门领土进行侵略。
    也门驻联合国常任代表卡迈勒·阿卜杜勒·拉希姆在一封给安全理事会主席的信中指责英国说，英国军队在10月5日进攻了也门的贝达城。在四小时的进攻中几个居民被打死，财产遭到了破坏。英国飞机在10月4日侵犯也门领空，在贝达上空进行挑衅飞行。在上月和10月早些时候在首都塔兹、贝达和卡塔巴也发生了类似的侵犯。
    信中说，英国的侵略行动完全是无端的，它威胁这个地区的和平和安全。
