Hubei Province's local machinery industry system’s vast workforce, while supporting the great victory in combating drought, has also actively plunged into the upsurge of autumn harvest and winter planting tool production.

Around the autumn equinox, Party committees at all levels convened meetings successively, comprehensively studying and arranging the production work of autumn harvest and winter planting tools based on the needs of agricultural production. Farm tool factories and machinery factories in various special districts, counties, and communes, according to the instructions of the Party committees, and on the basis of in-depth investigations, made specific arrangements, rapidly setting off an upsurge in autumn harvest and winter planting tool production, and have already achieved great results. In particular, inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production and realizing the forty articles of the agricultural development program ahead of schedule have become the practical actions of the vast workforce, the competition upsurge is rising steadily, and production records are constantly being refreshed. According to recent incomplete statistics from Yidu Industrial Zone and the four special districts of Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xiangyang, and Enshi, 153,000 power accessories have been manufactured, various drainage and irrigation power units totaling 22,473 horsepower, 1,770 water pumps, 3,140 power units and water pumps repaired, 38,000 deep plows manufactured, more than 5,900 harrows, more than 1,300 row seeders, 250 power threshers, more than 168,000 plowshares and plow moldboards, more than 765,000 small farm tools such as sickles, hoes, and iron shovels, and more than 41,000 old-fashioned walking plows have been modified. More than 2,500 processing tools such as cotton gins, rice hullers, and sweet potato slicers have been produced, providing strong support for the agricultural production movement centered on winter planting.

In order to improve the utilization efficiency of autumn harvest and winter planting tools, save labor, and suit the farming characteristics of various places, many factories have conducted in-depth investigations and research in rural areas, widely soliciting farmers' opinions, and adopting a method that combines leaders, workers, and farmers to improve the original autumn harvest and winter planting tools. In order to save farmers' time and facilitate the autumn harvest and winter planting, many factories have also adopted methods of dividing areas for fixed points, dividing labor for contracted responsibilities, conducting mobile repair and maintenance, and providing door-to-door repair and maintenance to promptly repair various autumn harvest and winter planting tools.

In the high tide of autumn harvest and winter planting tool production, the vast number of commune farm tool factories and handicraft workers have played a huge role.

    湖北地方工业大力修制农具
    宜都等地制造机械配件十五万多件排灌机械二万多匹马力
    本报讯　湖北省地方机械工业系统的广大职工，在支援抗旱取得巨大胜利的同时，又积极投入秋收冬播工具的生产高潮。
    入秋前后，各级党委根据农业生产需要先后召开了会议，全面研究布置了秋收冬播工具的生产工作。各专、县、社的农具厂和机械厂根据党委的指示，又在深入调查的基础上作了具体安排，迅速掀起了一个秋收冬播工具生产高潮，并已取得很大成绩。特别是在党的八届八中全会公报和决议鼓舞下，支援农业生产大跃进，提前实现农业发展纲要四十条，已成为广大职工的实际行动，竞赛热潮步步高涨，生产纪录不断刷新。据宜都工业区和黄冈、孝感、襄阳、恩施四个专区最近不完全的统计，已制造动力配件十五万三千件，各种排灌动力两万二千四百七十三匹马力、水泵一千七百七十台，修理动力、水泵三千一百四十台，制造了深耕犁三万八千部、耙五千九百多部、条播器一千三百多部、动力脱粒机二百五十部，犁铧犁镜十六万八千多件，镰刀、锄头、铁锹等小型农具七十六万五千多件，并改装了旧式步犁四万一千多部，生产了轧花机、砻谷机、红苕切片机等加工工具二千五百多台，为以冬播为中心的农业生产运动提供了有力的支援。
    为了提高秋收冬播工具的使用效率，节省劳动力，适合各地耕作特点，许多工厂深入农村调查研究，广泛征求农民意见，并采取领导、工、农相结合的办法，对原有的秋收冬播工具进行了改良。许多厂为了节省农民的时间，便利秋收冬播，还采取了分片定点、分工包干、巡回修配和登门修配的办法，及时修理各种秋收冬播工具。
    在大搞秋收冬播工具的生产高潮中，广大公社农具厂和手工业工人发挥了巨大作用。
