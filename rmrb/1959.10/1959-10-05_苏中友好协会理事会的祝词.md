To the dear friends of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters!

The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association extends its heartfelt congratulations to the participants of the grand meeting celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's multifaceted and fruitful activities have played a significant role in developing and consolidating the fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and in introducing the lives and achievements of the Soviet people to the Chinese people.

The great friendship and fraternal cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural construction promote the further development and prosperity of our two countries, reliably safeguard the security of our two countries, strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp, and guarantee universal peace and human progress.

The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as all the countries of the powerful socialist camp, are forever united and advancing along the broad road of communism, illuminated by the glorious doctrine of invincible Marxism-Leninism.

The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the friendship and unity among the people of all countries in the world socialist system, are an inexhaustible source of powerful strength to ensure our victory in the cause of building socialism and communism.

Inspired by the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are striving with great enthusiasm to complete the magnificent seven-year plan for the comprehensive construction of a communist society ahead of schedule, and are continuously achieving victories.

The Chinese people are greeting the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by victoriously completing and overfulfilling the magnificent tasks put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association extends its heartfelt congratulations to you, and through you to all the Chinese people, wishing you even greater achievements in realizing the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

All the people of the Soviet Union have consistently felt proud and happy about the remarkable achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people, because we are engaged in the same great cause of world historical significance, we have a common destiny and a common goal, which is to build a communist society and safeguard world peace.

Dear friends, through you, we extend our warm congratulations to all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and wish them new achievements in the noble cause of further developing the friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great, unbreakable, fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China!
