Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- The "Akahata" newspaper, the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, today published an editorial on the joint statement issued on the 20th in Beijing by the Communist Party of China and the Japanese Communist Party. The editorial pointed out that the joint statement further indicated the direction of the common struggle of the people of China and Japan and gave the Japanese people boundless encouragement.

The editorial said that the Communist Parties of China and Japan had issued a joint statement in March of this year. This statement elaborated in more depth on issues related to the two parties and the two countries amidst changes in the international situation, and further pointed out the direction of unity and common struggle for the people of the two countries.

"Akahata" emphasized that at present, in the important period when socialist forces and forces of national independence, peace, and democracy are increasingly overwhelming imperialist forces, the issuance of two historically significant joint statements by the Communist Parties of China and Japan marks the unshakeable friendship and unity of the two parties. At the same time, this will give boundless encouragement and support to the Japanese people who are waging a struggle for national independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy.

The editorial pointed out that this historically significant joint statement is completely in line with the basic line of the Japanese Communist Party. In order to make this joint statement, which is like a common struggle program for the people of China and Japan, deeply rooted in the hearts of the Japanese people, it is necessary to wage a struggle against modern revisionism and Trotskyist thought, and to strive to further consolidate the party's ranks ideologically and politically. The editorial said that since Khrushchev's visit to the United States, the international situation has increasingly developed in a direction favorable to national independence, peace, and democracy. Therefore, we are all the more convinced that socialism and the policy of peace are bound to win. But this does not mean that we can relax our vigilance and struggle against imperialism, especially against US imperialism. We must never forget that the current situation in Japan is a threat to peace in the Far East and the world.

"Akahata" said that the Japanese people, who are eager to strengthen friendship and unity with the great Chinese people, will certainly welcome this joint statement that indicates the correct path of struggle.

"Akahata" called on all party members to strive to ensure that the significance of the joint statement is grasped by the broad masses of the people, and at the same time to strive to deepen the people's understanding of the basic line of the Japanese Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- Leaders from all walks of life in Japan have expressed their support for the joint statement issued on the 20th by the Communist Party of China and the Japanese Communist Party delegation, and the joint statement issued on the 21st by the seven Chinese organizations and the Japanese delegation from all circles visiting China.

Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, said that the joint statement issued by the Japanese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party is not only a great document stipulating the common struggle of the two parties, but also a programmatic document pointing out the direction of the struggle of the Japanese people.

Kazami also said that the joint statement issued by the Japanese delegation from all circles and the seven Chinese organizations has encouraged the Japanese people who are struggling to prevent the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and to strive for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

Yanagimoto Yoshio, Director of the Organization Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointed out that the Japanese working class is working hard to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to strive for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. At a time when international tensions are easing and comprehensive disarmament has become a realistic issue, these two goals have become tasks that the Japanese working class must achieve.

Yanagimoto expressed that the General Council of Trade Unions wholeheartedly supports the joint statement issued by the Japanese delegation from all circles visiting China and the seven Chinese organizations, and is willing to work hand in hand with the Chinese people in the spirit of the statement.

Okada Muneyoshi, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, emphasized that the joint statement issued by the Japanese delegation from all circles visiting China and the seven Chinese organizations will surely play a beneficial role in breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations. Okada said that this statement is fully in line with the Socialist Party's policy, and the Socialist Party will respect this unanimous view of the Japanese delegation from all circles, and unite the people to work hard to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.

    日共“赤旗报”发表评论指出
    中日两党声明指明两国人民斗争方向
    日本各界支持中日两党联合声明和中国七团体同日本各界代表团的共同声明
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天就中国共产党和日本共产党20日在北京发表的联合声明发表社论指出，联合声明进一步指明了日中两国人民共同斗争的方向，并且给日本人民以无限的鼓舞。
    社论说，日中两国共产党在今年3月间曾经发表了一项联合声明，这次的声明更深入地阐述了在国际形势变化中同两党和两国有关系的问题，并进一步指出了两国人民团结和共同斗争的方向。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，目前，在社会主义力量和民族独立、和平、民主力量日益压倒帝国主义势力的重要时期，日中两国共产党发表了两项具有历史意义的联合声明这件事情标志着两国共产党不可动摇的友谊和团结，同时这将对正在为争取民族独立、和平、中立和民主而展开斗争的日本人民给予无限的鼓舞和支持。
    社论指出，这项具有历史意义的联合声明完全同日本共产党的基本路线一致。为了使这项就像日中两国人民共同斗争纲领一样的联合声明在日本深入人心，必须同现代修正主义和托洛茨基思想展开斗争，并且为进一步在思想和政治上巩固党的队伍而努力。社论说，自从赫鲁晓夫访问美国以来，国际形势越来越向有利于民族独立、和平、民主的方向发展。因此，我们愈加确信社会主义和和平政策必然胜利。但是这并不意味着这样一来就可以放松对帝国主义尤其是对美帝国主义的警惕和斗争。我们千万不可忘记，日本目前的情况是对远东和世界和平的一种威胁。
    “赤旗报”说，渴望同伟大的中国人民加强友好和团结的日本人民一定欢迎这项指明正确斗争路线的联合声明。
    “赤旗报”号召全体党员努力使联合声明的意义为广大人民所掌握，同时为使人民加深理解日本共产党的基本路线而奋斗。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本各界领袖表示支持中国共产党同日本共产党代表团、中国七个团体同日本各界访华代表团分别在20日和21日发表的联合声明和共同声明。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章说，日共和中共发表的联合声明不仅是规定日中两国共产党共同斗争的伟大文件，并且也是指出日本人民的斗争方向的纲领性文件。
    风见章还说，日本各界代表团同中国七个团体发表的共同声明鼓舞了正在为阻止修改日美“安全条约”和争取恢复日中邦交而斗争的日本人民。
    日本工会总评议会组织部长柳本美雄指出，日本工人阶级正在为阻止修改“安全条约”和争取恢复日中邦交而努力。在国际紧张局势趋向缓和、全面裁军成为现实课题的时候，这两个目标已成为日本工人阶级必定要实现的任务。
    柳本表示，总评议会衷心支持日本各界访华代表团同中国七个团体发表的共同声明，并愿本着声明的精神同中国人民携手奋斗。
    社会党国际局局长冈田宗司强调指出，日本各界访华代表团同中国七个团体发表的共同声明必将对打开日中关系僵局起有益的作用。冈田表示，这项声明完全符合社会党的方针，社会党将尊重这个日本各界代表一致的见解，并团结人民为打开日中关系僵局而努力。
