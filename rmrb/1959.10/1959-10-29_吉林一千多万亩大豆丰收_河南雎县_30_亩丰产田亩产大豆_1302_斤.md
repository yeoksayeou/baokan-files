Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 27th. Jilin Province has reaped a bumper harvest of soybeans on thirteen million mu of land. According to preliminary actual yield assessments from various locations, the average yield per mu of soybeans across the province is expected to increase by approximately 15% compared to last year. The Siping area, with 2.9 million mu of soybeans, anticipates an average yield per mu increase of over 20% compared to last year. In Dehui County, Changchun area, projections based on a portion of the threshed soybeans indicate an average yield per mu increase of over 60% compared to last year. In Panshi County, Jilin area, the Mingcheng People's Commune's more than 21,000 mu of soybeans are expected to achieve an average yield of 286 jin per mu, a 70% increase compared to last year. In Tonghua area, the Taishan Management District of the Taishan People's Commune in Ji'an County, after actual yield verification, the 150 mu of high-yield soybean fields achieved a remarkable yield of 500 jin per mu.

This year, Jilin Province farmers, in order to meet the state's demand for commercial oil crops, expanded the soybean planting area and actively adopted measures to increase the yield per unit area. Various regions have further improved farming methods, implemented deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and carefully managed the crops, resulting in vigorous soybean growth this year: more branching, denser pods, and more abundant and plump seeds. Each soybean plant produced twenty to thirty more pods than in the past.

During the soybean growth process, the province overcame the threat of drought and other disasters. In early summer, most parts of the province did not receive substantial rainfall for fifty to sixty days. Various regions promptly launched a drought resistance campaign. Soybean fields severely affected by drought were thoroughly irrigated. Nearly one-third of the soybean fields with missing seedlings or broken rows due to drought were replanted two or three times, ensuring full and strong seedlings.

People's communes rationally arranged labor forces and established many specialized soybean production teams and groups, ensuring very meticulous soybean cultivation, which is a prominent feature of this year's soybean production. Most soybean fields this year underwent two or three harrowings after deep plowing. Fertilizer application per hectare increased by more than 300 dan compared to the past. Reasonable close planting was implemented, increasing the number of plants per mu from 10,000 to over 14,000. During the soybean growth period, the fields were cultivated and earthed up more than three times, 90% of the soybean fields were weeded, and some received topdressing fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou. Kaifeng Special Zone in Henan Province has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of soybeans. The average yield per unit area of the 6,554,000 mu of soybeans in the entire area increased by more than 30% compared to 1958. Furthermore, many high-yield fields have emerged. The 30 mu of soybeans in the Liu Lou Youth Experimental Field of the Sun Juyan Commune in Suixian County achieved an average yield of 1,302 jin per mu.

Early planting, sufficient planting, and good planting are the fundamental keys to the large soybean harvest in the Kaifeng Special Zone. In the Kaifeng area, soybeans are not only an oil crop but also a staple food for the masses. The people throughout the area have historically had the habit of growing soybeans, but in the past, they always considered soybeans to be a low-yield crop, and cultivation was very rough. Generally, no base fertilizer or very little base fertilizer was applied, and they were only planted and not cared for, resulting in low yields. To change this situation, in May of this year, a mass discussion was launched throughout the area, summarizing the yield increase experiences of soybean experimental fields and high-yield fields in 1958, and generally formulating measures to increase production. The entire area fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes, "large scale and public ownership," adjusting the land according to local conditions, expanding the planting area from 4,469,000 mu in 1958 to 6,554,000 mu, deep plowing 80% of the land, and preparing fields and building ridges on 30%. They also vigorously developed high-yield plots, expanded the area of improved varieties, and increased the seeding rate. An average of 30 to 40 dan of base fertilizer was applied per mu, and planting was advanced by 10 to 15 days. Under the unified leadership of the commune, labor was rationally arranged, soybean specialized teams were established, and management was strengthened.

During the period when soybeans required a large amount of water, a severe drought occurred, lasting for a hundred and ten days without substantial rainfall. The broad masses fought day and night in the fields, drawing water to irrigate the fields, so that all soybean fields were universally irrigated two to three times, ensuring a bumper harvest.

    吉林一千多万亩大豆丰收
    河南雎县30亩丰产田亩产大豆1302斤
    新华社长春27日电　吉林省一千三百万亩大豆丰收。根据各地部分实打验收情况，预计全省大豆平均亩产量将比去年提高一成半左右。四平地区二百九十万亩大豆，平均亩产量将比去年提高两成以上。长春地区的德惠县，根据一部分已脱粒的大豆情况推算，平均亩产量将比去年提高六成多。吉林地区磐石县明城人民公社的两万一千多亩大豆，平均亩产可达二百八十六斤，比去年增产七成。通化地区辑安县台上人民公社台上管理区种植的一百五十亩大豆高产田，经实打验收，亩产高达五百斤。
    今年吉林省农民为了满足国家对商品油料的需要，扩大了大豆播种面积，并且积极采取措施提高大豆单位面积产量。各地都进一步改进耕作方法，实行深耕细作，精心管理，从而使今年的大豆生育繁茂：分枝多、结荚密、籽多粒饱。每棵豆子比过去多结荚二十个到三十个。
    在大豆生长过程中，战胜了干旱等灾害的威胁。初夏，全省大部分地区五、六十天未降透雨。各地及时掀起了抗旱运动。旱象严重的豆田都进行了洗灌。因干旱而缺苗断条的近三分之一的豆田，都补种了两三次，终于保证了苗全苗壮。
    各人民公社合理安排劳力，建立了许多大豆生产专业队和专业小组，保证大豆耕作非常细致，这是今年大豆生产上的一个突出特点。今年大部分豆田在经过深翻后又进行了两三次耙压。每公顷施肥量比过去增加了三百多担。实行了合理密植、每亩株数由一万株增加到一万四千株以上。在大豆生长期间，中耕培土三遍以上，90％豆地拔了大草，部分追了肥。
    据新华社郑州讯　河南开封专区大豆大面积丰收。全区六百五十五点四万亩大豆，平均单位面积产量比1958年增产三成多。并且出现了不少高额丰产田。睢县孙聚岩公社刘楼青年试验场三十亩大豆，平均亩产一千三百零二斤。
    种早、种足、种好是开封专区大豆大丰收的根本关键。大豆，在开封地区不仅是油料，而且是群众主要的食粮。全区群众历年来有种大豆的习惯，但过去一直认为大豆是低产作物，耕作非常粗糙。一般不施底肥或很少施底肥，只种不管，因此产量低。为了改变这种情况，今年5月间全区各地开展了一次全民大讨论，总结了1958年大豆试验田、丰产田的增产经验，普遍制定了增产措施。全区充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，因地制宜的调整了土地，使播种面积由1958年的四百四十六点九万亩扩大到六百五十五点四万亩，80％的土地进行了深翻，30％进行了整地打畦。还大搞丰产方，扩大了良种面积，加大下种量。平均每亩施底肥三十担至四十担，并且提前十至十五天播种。在公社统一领导下，合理安排劳力，成立大豆专业队，加强管理。
    在大豆大量需水时期，发生了严重干旱，一直持续百十天未落过透雨，广大群众日夜奋战田间，车水浇田，使全部豆田普遍浇水两次至三次，保证了丰收。
