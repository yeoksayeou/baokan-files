Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th—TASS: Soviet Deputy Premier Kosygin delivered a report to the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet on the 27th, concerning the 1960 Soviet National Economic Development Plan.

	This year's industrial growth rate has greatly exceeded the original plan, and the total harvest of many crops is expected to exceed the average annual harvest of the last five years.

	Kosygin first spoke about the achievements made by the Soviet Union in 1959. He said that the unprecedented scientific and technological achievements made by the Soviet Union this year have made it fully justified to call this year the beginning of a new era for mankind's conquest of outer space. Kosygin pointed out that this year the growth rate of Soviet industrial production has greatly exceeded the annual average target set by the Seven-Year Plan. The production of the means of production will increase by 12%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 10.5%. In agriculture, although the climatic conditions in many parts of the Soviet Union were not good this year, the total harvest of grains, beets, and many other crops is expected to exceed the average annual harvest of the last five years, and cotton will have a bumper harvest. He said that the results of 1959 eloquently prove that the tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are being successfully realized.

	Next year, the total industrial output value will increase by 8.1%, steel production will reach 65 million tons, and the total grain harvest will reach approximately 9.3 billion poods.

	When talking about the 1960 Soviet National Economic Development Plan, Kosygin pointed out that in 1960, the Soviet Union will take another big step forward in solving its main economic tasks and improving the people's living standards. The achievements made in completing the tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan make it possible to propose higher targets in 1960 than those stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. This will lay a solid foundation for completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule in 1960.

	Kosygin said that in 1960, the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union will increase by 8.1% compared with this year. Steel production will almost reach 65 million tons, and iron ore mining will exceed 105 million tons. The plan also stipulates further increases in the production of non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and precious metals, while increasing the mining of diamonds.

	The 1960 plan stipulates the high-speed development of the chemical industry and further development of the fuel industry. In 1960, the Soviet Union's oil production will increase by nearly 15 million tons, reaching 144 million tons.

	Kosygin continued, like in previous years, the growth rate of electricity production in the Soviet Union in 1960 will exceed the average development rate of industry. Electricity production will reach 291 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 11.2% compared with this year.

	Kosygin also talked about the development scale of the Soviet machine-building industry, metal processing industry, building materials industry, and consumer goods industry in 1960.

	Kosygin then pointed out that Soviet agriculture is now booming. In 1960, the total grain harvest in the Soviet Union will reach approximately 9.3 billion poods. Meat production will increase to 10.06 million tons (slaughter weight). Kosygin said that we estimate that we can obtain about 72 million tons of milk, that is, an average of 336 kilograms per person, while the United States only had 330 kilograms last year.

	Kosygin pointed out that in 1960, the total basic investment of the Soviet Union is set at 255.5 billion rubles, and 40% of this appropriation will be used to develop the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. In 1960, the production of ferrous metals and electricity in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union will also exceed the total output of the entire Soviet Union ten years ago.

	Kosygin then talked about the economic development of the Soviet republics in 1960. Kosygin said that the draft national economic development plan for 1960 stipulates that labor productivity will increase by 5.8%. This increase in labor productivity will be guaranteed by improving the level of technical equipment.

	Kosygin said that our party has put forward such a task: to enable the Soviet people to enjoy the highest living standards in the world. The achievements of our country's economic development make people confident that this task will be successfully completed.

	He said that in 1960, the national income of the Soviet Union will increase by approximately 9%. Employees in various sectors of the national economy will implement a seven-hour work system. The fact that the Soviet Union shortens the working day without reducing wages, but instead continues to increase wages, is of great significance.

	Kosygin pointed out that the Soviet Union will build approximately 2.4 million new houses next year, and approximately 10 million people will move into new houses. In addition, collective farm members and rural intellectuals will build approximately one million houses.

	In 1960, the retail trade volume of the Soviet Union will increase by approximately 50 billion rubles, reaching 765 billion rubles.

	In 1960, the Soviet Union will train 119,000 engineers, which is 2.5 times more than the number of engineers trained by the United States in 1958.

	Kosygin pointed out that the Soviet Union's plan to improve the people's living standards in 1960 once again convincingly proves that the Soviet Union's plan is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction.

	The Soviet Union's foreign economic relations are expanding day by day, and next year it will technically assist 22 countries in the world to build 383 industrial enterprises and industrial projects.

	Kosygin also talked about Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States in his report. He said that this visit was a major event of our time. Kosygin said that Khrushchev convincingly proved that the Soviet state is implementing a policy of peace and that the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is not due to the weakness of the Soviet Union, but because the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to prevent new wars and establish lasting international peace. This visit gave billions of people greater hope, and this visit was rightly regarded as a visit for peace.

	Kosygin also talked about further developing the Soviet Union's economic cooperation with other countries in his report.

	He said that the Soviet Union's economic development provides new conditions for expanding trade and other economic relations with foreign countries. In the first two years of the Seven-Year Plan alone, the total value of Soviet foreign trade will increase by 25%.

	In 1960, the Soviet Union will technically assist 22 countries in the world to build 383 industrial enterprises and industrial projects. Among them, it will help socialist countries build 288 industrial enterprises and industrial projects, and help economically underdeveloped countries build 95 projects. The most complete sets of equipment are provided to the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.

	Kosygin said that the Soviet Union's consistent policy in developing foreign trade has greatly improved trade relations between the Soviet Union and many Western capitalist countries. The signing of trade agreements with Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, Finland, Sweden, and many other capitalist countries has greatly promoted this situation.

	For ten years, our trade relations with the United States have been stagnant. However, we hope that Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and Mr. Eisenhower's return visit to our country will also help to activate mutually beneficial trade between the Soviet Union and the United States.

	The Soviet Union has achieved great success in its economic competition with capitalism and will definitely be able to catch up with the United States in a relatively short period of time.

	Kosygin then talked about the achievements made by the Soviet Union in its economic competition with capitalism. He said that the high speed of Soviet economic development guarantees that the Soviet Union and the major capitalist country, the United States, will quickly approach the economic development level. The achievements of Soviet economic development convincingly show that the Soviet people are successfully solving the task of maximizing the time gained in the competition with capitalism. From 1959 to 1960, our country will increase steel production by 10 million tons (from 54.9 million tons to 64.9 million tons), while it took the United States twelve years to increase steel production to this level. We will increase electricity production by 56 billion kilowatt-hours (from 235.4 billion kilowatt-hours to 291.15 billion kilowatt-hours), while it took the Americans five years to achieve the same growth. The Soviet Union's oil extraction will increase by 31 million tons in these two years (from 113.2 million tons to 144 million tons), while it took the United States nine years to achieve this goal.

	Kosygin said that the Soviet Union is rapidly increasing its economic strength. The materials from the first two years of the Seven-Year Plan predict with confidence that the Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed, but also greatly overfulfilled. This is a reliable guarantee that we will definitely be able to catch up with the United States in a relatively short period of time. Kosygin said that just as the Soviet Union's economy is booming, the US economy, which has just emerged from the 1958 crisis, has encountered serious economic difficulties. The US industrial production index has fallen, and this index is now at the level of December 1956 to February 1957. According to official materials, there are approximately four million completely unemployed people in the United States.

	The actual situation proves that the development speed of our country's industry is much higher than that of the United States. In the seven years from 1952 to 1958, our country's industrial production increased by 1.1 times, with an average annual growth rate of nearly 11.5%. The United States' production only increased by 11.7% during the same period, with an average annual growth rate of 1.6%.

	Kosygin said that the economic competition between the two systems not only does not exclude peaceful coexistence, but also presupposes its peaceful coexistence. We hope to improve relations between countries with different social systems.

    柯西金在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作报告
    苏联明年经济将继续高速发展
    将为大大超额完成七年计划打下稳固的基础
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议副主席柯西金27日在苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议上作了关于1960年苏联发展国民经济计划的报告。
    今年工业增长速度大大超过原定计划，许多农作物总收获量可望超过最近五年的年平均收获量。
    柯西金在报告中首先谈到了苏联在1959年所取得的成就。他说，苏联在今年取得的空前未有的科学技术成就，使得有充分根据称今年为人类征服宇宙空间新时代的开始。柯西金指出，今年苏联工业生产的增长速度大大超过七年计划所规定的年平均任务。生产资料的生产将增加12％，消费品生产将增加10.5％。在农业方面，尽管今年苏联许多地区的气候条件不好，但是谷物、甜菜和其他许多农作物的总收获量可望超过最近五年的年平均收获量，而棉花将获得丰收。他说，1959年的结果雄辩地证明，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的任务正在顺利地实现。
    明年工业总产值将增加8.1％，钢产量将达六千五百万吨，谷物总收获量要达到约九十三亿普特。
    柯西金在谈到1960年苏联发展国民经济计划时指出，在1960年，苏联将在解决它的主要经济任务和提高人民生活水平方面再向前迈进一大步。在完成七年计划第一年的任务方面取得的成就，使得有可能在1960年提出比七年计划中规定的更高的任务。这一来，在1960年就将为提前完成七年计划打下稳固的基础。
    柯西金说，1960年，苏联工业总产值将比今年增加8.1％。钢产量将差不多达到六千五百万吨，铁矿砂开采量将超过一亿零五百万吨。计划中还规定进一步增加有色金属、稀有金属和贵金属的产量，同时增加金刚石的开采量。
    1960年计划规定高速度发展化学工业，进一步发展燃料工业。在1960年，苏联的石油产量将增加将近一千五百万吨，而达到一亿四千四百万吨。
    柯西金接着说，像往年一样，1960年苏联发电量的增长速度将超过工业的平均发展速度。发电量将达到二千九百一十亿度，即比今年增加11.2％。
    柯西金还谈到了1960年苏联机器制造工业和金属加工工业、建筑材料工业和消费品工业的发展规模。
    柯西金接着指出，苏联的农业现在正在蓬勃发展。1960年，苏联的谷物总收获量要达到约九十三亿普特。肉类生产将增加到一千零六十万吨（屠宰重量）。柯西金说，我们估计能获得约七千二百万吨牛奶，即按人口平均计算，每人平均三百三十六公斤，而美国去年只有三百三十公斤。
    柯西金指出，1960年，苏联的基本投资总额规定为二千五百五十五亿卢布，这笔拨款中有40％将用于发展苏联的东部地区。1960年，苏联东部地区生产的黑色金属和电力还将超过比十年前全苏联的产量。
    柯西金接着在报告中谈到了1960年苏联各加盟共和国经济发展的情况。柯西金说，1960年发展国民经济计划草案规定，劳动生产率将提高5.8％。劳动生产率的这种增长将通过提高技术装备水平的办法来保证。
    柯西金说，我们党提出了这样的任务：要使苏联人民享有世界上最高的生活水平。我国经济发展的成就使人确信，这个任务必将胜利完成。
    他说，1960年，苏联国民收入大约将增加9％。国民经济各部门职工将实现七小时工作制。苏联缩短工作日并不降低工资，而反继续提高工资，这个事实有着重大的意义。
    柯西金指出，苏联在明年将建筑大约二百四十万套新住宅，将约有一千万人迁入新的住宅。此外，集体农庄庄员和农村知识分子将建造约一百万幢住宅。
    1960年，苏联的零售贸易额将大约增加五百亿卢布，即达到七千六百五十亿卢布。
    在1960年，苏联培养的工程师将达到十一万九千人，将比美国在1958年培养的工程师多二点五倍。
    柯西金指出，1960年苏联提高人民生活水平的计划再一次令人信服地证明，苏联的计划是和平的经济和文化建设的计划。
    苏联对外经济关系日益扩大，明年将在技术上帮助世界上二十二个国家建设三百八十三个工业企业和工业项目。
    柯西金在报告中还谈到了苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫访问美国的问题，他说，这次访问是我们时代的一个重大事件。柯西金说，赫鲁晓夫令人信服地证明，苏维埃国家执行和平政策以及苏联政府提出关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，并非由于苏联软弱，而是由于苏联真诚希望防止新战争和建立国际持久和平。这次访问使亿万人们产生了更大的希望，这次访问被公正地认为是和平访问。
    柯西金在报告中还谈到了进一步发展苏联同其他国家的经济合作问题。
    他说，苏联的经济发展为扩大同外国的贸易和其他经济关系提供了新的条件。仅在七年计划的头二年，苏联对外贸易的总额就将增加25％。
    1960年，苏联将在技术上帮助世界上二十二个国家建设三百八十三个工业企业和工业项目，其中，将帮助社会主义国家兴建二百八十八个工业企业和工业项目，将帮助经济不发达国家建设九十五个项目。向中华人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚提供的整套设备为数最多。
    柯西金说，苏联在发展对外贸易方面一贯奉行的政策，大大地改善了苏联同西方许多资本主义国家的贸易关系。同英国、法国、意大利、西德、芬兰、瑞典和其他许多资本主义国家签订贸易协定，在很大程度上促进了这种情况。
    十年来，我们同美国的贸易关系处于停滞状态。但是，我们希望，赫鲁晓夫同志的访美以及艾森豪威尔先生将到我国的回访，也将有助于活跃苏美两国之间的互利贸易。
    苏联在同资本主义进行经济竞赛中获得巨大成就，一定能在比较短的时间内赶上美国。
    柯西金接着谈到了苏联在同资本主义进行经济竞赛中获得的成就。他说，苏联经济发展的高速度，保证苏联和资本主义世界的主要国家美国的经济发展水平很快地接近。苏联经济发展的成就令人信服地表明，苏联人民顺利地解决着在同资本主义竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的任务。1959—1960年，我国将把钢产量增加一千万吨（从五千四百九十万吨增加到六千四百九十万吨），而美国为了把钢产量提高到这种水平却花了十二年。我们要把电力生产增加五百六十亿度（从二千三百五十四亿度增加到二千九百一十一亿五千万度），而美国人为了取得同样的增长却花了五年的时间。苏联的石油开采量在这二年中将增加三千一百万吨（从一亿一千三百二十万吨增加到一亿四千四百万吨），而美国为了达到这个目的曾花了九年的时间。
    柯西金说，苏联在迅速地增强自己的经济实力。七年计划头二年的材料令人满怀信心地预言：七年计划不仅可以完成，而且可以大大超额完成。这是我们一定能够在比较短的时间内赶上美国的可靠保证。柯西金说，正当苏联的经济蓬勃高涨的时候，刚刚摆脱了1958年危机的美国经济，却又遇到了严重的经济困难。美国的工业生产指数下跌，这个指数现在正处在1956年12月至1957年2月的水平上。根据官方的材料，美国大约有四百万完全失业的人。
    实际情况证明，我国工业的发展速度大大高于美国的速度。在1952—1958年的七年中，我国的工业生产增加了一点一倍，平均每年的增长率将近达11.5％。美国的生产在同时期中只增长了11.7％，平均每年的增长率为1.6％。
    柯西金说，两个制度的经济竞赛不仅不排斥和平共处，而且要以它和平共处为前提。我们希望改善不同社会制度国家之间的关系。
