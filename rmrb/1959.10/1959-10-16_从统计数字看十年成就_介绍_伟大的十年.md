    The great People's Republic of China has been established for ten glorious years.

    Ten years ago, when the People's Republic of China was about to be born, the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, predicted: "The Chinese people will see that once the fate of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will, like the sun rising in the East, illuminate the earth with its brilliant light, rapidly wash away the mud and stagnant water left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of war, and build a brand-new, strong, and truly People's Republic of China." Now, actual life has unfolded before people just as Comrade Mao Zedong predicted.

    Over the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, and with the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people in the world, the Chinese people have achieved extremely brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In just ten short years, the socio-economic structure, the face of the national economy, and the spiritual outlook of the people in our country have undergone extremely profound and great changes. We have basically eliminated the private ownership of the means of production, ended the history of class exploitation spanning thousands of years, and the socialist system has been firmly established. A new, independent, and complete national economic system is taking shape, the foundation of socialist industrialization has been firmly established, and industrial and agricultural production has grown exponentially. The newly developed production capacity in the past ten years exceeds the production capacity accumulated over thousands of years in history. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural living standards of the people have been significantly improved. The people's ideological understanding and spiritual outlook have also been completely renewed, demonstrating unparalleled confidence and determination in building a better life of socialism and communism.

    The great achievements created by the 650 million Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong over the past ten years need to be reflected in all aspects. The recently compiled "The Great Ten Years" by the State Statistical Bureau and published by the People's Publishing House is a book that uses a large number of statistics to comprehensively and systematically reflect the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in economic and cultural construction over the past ten years.

    "The Great Ten Years" is an extremely important reference book. Every statistical table and every set of statistical series in the book represents the crystallization of the noble labor of millions of working people and the fruitful results of the Party's General Line. Through these statistics, people can clearly see how great the superiority of the socialist system is and how great and unparalleled the power that the liberated working people can unleash!

    Below, we will briefly introduce the contents of "The Great Ten Years."

    The entire book is divided into ten chapters, each with rich statistical tables and concise textual explanations. The beginning of the volume includes more than thirty color statistical charts that comprehensively reflect the great achievements made in all aspects of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years.

    The first chapter of this book has such a striking title: "The Growth and Strength of the People's Republic of China." In this chapter, people can specifically understand what kind of country China is—one with a large population, vast territory, magnificent mountains and rivers, and abundant resources. They can understand to what extent the national economy of old China was backward due to the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, they can see even more clearly what great achievements the liberated Chinese people have made in all aspects of industrial and agricultural production under the leadership of the Party over the past ten years. In order to help readers understand the growth and strength of the People's Republic of China, the editors not only used concise statistical tables to demonstrate at what speed our national economy is advancing, but also briefly introduced the general process of the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country over the past ten years in the textual explanations, and focused on explaining the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959. At the same time, the editors also used a few short figures, using the method of comparison, to vividly and concretely introduce that the productive capacity developed in the new China in ten years has greatly exceeded the productive capacity accumulated in old China for thousands of years, and demonstrated that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system.

    The second chapter focuses on introducing the great victory of China's socialist revolution and the people's commune movement. This chapter first introduces that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the land reform was thoroughly completed in just three years, eliminating the feudal exploitation system that had existed in our country for thousands of years, and liberating the rural productive forces. Then, it introduced the great victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce achieved by the people of our country under the guidance of the Party's general line for the transition period, and focused on demonstrating the great significance of the people's commune movement that emerged in 1958. The editors organized a statistical table "People's Communes in the Countryside Shine Radiantly" in this chapter. The statistics listed in this table convincingly illustrate the great vitality of the people's communes. Those domestic and foreign hostile elements who shamelessly slander and attack the people's communes in our country, saying that the people's communes are "a mess," cannot but reveal their true colors in front of this statistical table!

    The third chapter focuses on introducing the large-scale basic construction carried out by the people of our country over the past ten years. From the various sets of statistical tables in this chapter, people can clearly see that the scale of basic construction in our country has been expanding year after year. For example, the average annual investment during the First Five-Year Plan exceeded the total investment during the period of national economic recovery (three years), and the investment in 1958 alone was close to half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, it can also be seen that the distribution of basic construction investment in our country has thoroughly implemented the Party's policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. As a result of large-scale industrial construction, the ideal of realizing national industrialization, which the people of our country have dreamed of for many years, has gradually become a living reality, and the foundation of socialist industrialization has been firmly established.

    Rich statistical tables tell us that while carrying out large-scale industrial construction, our country has also made great achievements in the construction of transportation, farmland water conservancy, culture and education, urban public utilities, and employee housing. If readers want to know how many railways and highways have been newly built in our country over the past ten years, and what are the newly built major trunk lines, they can see it at a glance by opening the relevant statistical tables in this chapter. In order to illustrate the huge scale of water conservancy construction in our country over the past ten years, the editors calculated such an eye-catching account: the amount of earth and stone work completed in water conservancy construction in our country over the past ten years is equivalent to excavating four hundred Panama Canals or nine hundred and sixty Suez Canals. If these earth and stone works are connected according to a volume of one cubic meter, it is approximately equal to one thousand seven hundred and seventy times the length of the Earth's equator.

    If readers want to comprehensively observe the effect of the basic construction carried out by the state over the past ten years, they can get an answer from the statistical tables of newly added fixed assets attached to this chapter. This set of statistical tables tells us that in the nine years from 1950 to 1958, the newly added fixed assets due to basic construction reached 71.9 billion yuan, of which the newly added industrial fixed assets reached 34.36 billion yuan, equivalent to 2.7 times the total industrial fixed assets accumulated in old China for nearly a hundred years.

    Chapters four to seven reflect the great achievements made in China's industrial production, agricultural production, transportation, postal and telecommunications services, and commerce over the past ten years. These chapters also focus on explaining the brilliant achievements made by the people of our country in these aspects in 1958 under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Building Socialism. The large amount of rich statistical data listed in each chapter powerfully proves what kind of leap forward speed the socialist system has brought to the development of social productive forces in our country.

    Data shows that the growth rate of industrial and agricultural production in the new China is not only unprecedented in old China, but also beyond the reach of capitalist countries. For example, in the nine years from 1950 to 1958, industrial production in our country increased by 8.3 times, with an average annual increase of 28.1%. Industrial production in the United States increased by 39%, with an average annual increase of only 3.7%; industrial production in the United Kingdom increased by 29.5%, with an average annual increase of only 2.9%. In terms of agricultural production, during the same period, grain production in our country increased by 1.3 times, and cotton production increased by 3.7 times, while grain production in the United States increased by only 25.2%, and cotton production not only did not increase, but also decreased by 28%; grain production in the United Kingdom decreased by 6.5%. This is the most powerful proof that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system.

    The development of transportation, postal and telecommunications services, and domestic and foreign commerce in our country over the past ten years are recorded in detail in special chapters in the book.

    Chapters eight to ten focus on reflecting the rapid progress of China's cultural and educational undertakings and the improvement of the people's material and cultural life over the past ten years.

    Data shows that over the past ten years, on the basis of the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production, the ranks of the working class in our country have expanded unprecedentedly; the unemployment phenomenon left over from old China has been eliminated, and the material and cultural living standards of the broad masses of working people have been significantly improved. This is the happiness that the socialist system has already brought to the working people of our country.

    From the above very brief introduction, it can be seen that "The Great Ten Years" is a reference book with extremely rich content. General readers can specifically understand the great achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years, propagandists can obtain powerful propaganda materials from it, educators can obtain extremely rich teaching materials from it, and economic science researchers can also obtain relevant materials for studying China's socialist economic issues from it.

    At this time when people of all ethnic groups across the country are celebrating the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled joy and excitement, warmly congratulating the great victory of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years, and bravely advancing under the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the publication of "The Great Ten Years" will undoubtedly further encourage the people of all ethnic groups across the country to move from victory to greater victory under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, its publication will also more forcefully give those domestic and foreign hostile elements and domestic right-leaning opportunists who have consistently slandered and attacked our country's great socialist cause and slandered our country's Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the people's commune movement a head-on blow.

　　从统计数字看十年成就  介绍“伟大的十年”

    伟大的中华人民共和国成立已经十周年了。
    十年以前，当中华人民共和国将要宣告诞生的时候，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志就预言说：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的中华人民民主共和国。”现在，实际生活已经正如毛泽东同志所预言地那样展现在人们的面前。
    十年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助下，在全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情和支持下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的极其辉煌的成就。短短十年的时间，我国的社会经济结构、国民经济面貌和人民的精神面貌，发生了极其深刻而伟大的变化。我们已经基本上消灭了生产资料的私有制度，结束了几千年来阶级剥削的历史，社会主义制度已经巩固地建立起来了；新的独立的完整的国民经济体系正在形成中，社会主义工业化的基础已经巩固地建立起来了，工农业生产成倍地增长，十年中新发展的生产能力，超过了历史上几千年积累起来的生产能力；在生产发展的基础上，人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平显著地提高了；人民的思想认识和精神面貌也焕然一新，对建设社会主义、共产主义的美好生活表现着无比的信心和决心。
    十年来六亿五千万中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下所创立的丰功伟绩，需要我们从各方面加以反映。最近由国家统计局编写、人民出版社出版的“伟大的十年”，就是运用大量的统计数字，比较全面地、系统地反映中华人民共和国十年来在经济和文化建设方面所取得的伟大成就的一本书。
    “伟大的十年”是一本极其重要的资料书。书中的每一张统计表，每一组统计数列，都代表着千千万万劳动人民所进行的高尚劳动的结晶，代表着党的总路线所结的丰硕果实。人们透过这些统计数字，可以很清楚地看到：社会主义制度具有多么巨大的优越性，解放了的劳动人民可以发挥出多么巨大无比的力量！
    下面，我们简要地介绍一下“伟大的十年”这本书的内容。
    全书共分十个篇章，每篇除有内容丰富的统计表，还有简明扼要的文字说明；卷首附有三十多幅概括反映我国十年来社会主义革命和社会主义建设各方面所取得的伟大成就的彩色统计图。
    这本书的首篇，是这样一个醒目的题目：“中华人民共和国的成长与壮大”。在这一篇里，人们可以具体地了解到，中国是怎样的一个人口众多，国土辽阔，山川壮丽，物产丰富的国家；了解到旧中国由于长期受着帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，国民经济落后到什么程度；同时，更可以看出，解放了的中国人民在党的领导下，十年来在工农业生产等各方面取得了何等伟大的成就。为了帮助读者了解中华人民共和国的成长与壮大，编者不仅运用简明的统计表，论证了我国的国民经济以什么样的速度向前奋进，而且在文字说明中，扼要地介绍了十年来我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设发展的一般过程，并着重地说明了1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续大跃进。同时，编者也用简短的几个数目字，用对比的方法，生动而具体地介绍了新中国十年中发展的生产能力，大大超过了旧中国几千年积累起来的生产能力，论证了社会主义制度远远优越于资本主义制度。
    第二篇着重介绍了我国社会主义革命和人民公社化运动的伟大胜利。这一篇中，首先介绍了中华人民共和国成立后，经过短短三年的时间，就彻底地完成了土地改革，消灭了在我国存在了几千年的封建剥削制度，解放了农村生产力；接着用较大的篇幅，介绍了我国人民在党的过渡时期总路线的指引下，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造所取得的伟大胜利；并且着重论证了1958年出现的人民公社化运动的伟大意义。编者在这一篇中组织了一张“农村人民公社光芒万丈”的统计表，这张表中列举的统计数字，令人信服地说明了人民公社的伟大生命力。那些无耻地诬蔑和攻击我国的人民公社，说什么人民公社“办糟了”的国内外敌对分子，在这张统计表前不能不原形毕露了！
    第三篇集中地介绍了十年来我国人民所进行的巨大规模的基本建设。从这一篇的各组统计表中，人们可以很清楚地看到，十年来我国的基本建设规模年复一年地扩大，例如第一个五年计划期间平均每年的投资超过了国民经济恢复时期（三年）的总和，而1958年一年的投资又接近第一个五年计划时期全部投资的一半。同时，也可以看出，我国基本建设投资的分配，贯彻执行了党的优先发展重工业的方针。由于进行大规模的工业建设的结果，我国人民多少年来梦寐以求的实现国家工业化的理想，已经逐渐变成活生生的现实，社会主义工业化的基础已经巩固地建立起来了。
    内容丰富的统计表告诉我们，我国在进行大规模的工业建设的同时，在交通运输、农田水利、文化教育、城市公用事业和职工住宅等的建设方面，也取得了巨大成就。如果读者想知道十年来我国新建了多少铁路、公路，有哪些新建的主要干线，打开这一篇的有关统计表，便可一目了然。为了说明十年来我国水利建设的巨大规模，编者算了这样一笔引人注目的账：十年来我国水利建设完成的土石方，约相当于挖掘四百条巴拿马运河或九百六十条苏伊士运河的工程量。如果把这些土石方按一立方米的体积接连起来，约等于地球赤道长度的一千七百七十倍。
    读者如果想综合观察十年来国家所进行的基本建设的效果，则从这一篇所附的各张新增固定资产统计表中可以得到回答。这一组统计表告诉我们，从1950年到1958年的九年中，由于基本建设而新增加的固定资产达七百十九亿元，其中新增加的工业固定资产达三百四十三亿六千万元，相当于旧中国近百年中积累起来的工业固定资产总和的二点七倍。
    第四篇到第七篇，是反映十年来我国工业生产、农业生产、运输邮电事业和商业等各方面所取得的伟大成就的。这几篇还着重说明了1958年我国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在这几个方面所取得的辉煌成就。各篇中列举的大量的、丰富的统计资料，有力地证明了社会主义制度给我国社会生产力的发展带来了什么样的跃进速度。
    资料表明，新中国工农业生产的增长速度，不但是旧中国从来没有过的，而且是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。例如，从1950年到1958年的九年中，我国工业生产增长了八点三倍，平均每年增长28.1％，美国的工业生产增长了39％，平均每年只增长3.7％；英国的工业生产增长了29.5％，平均每年只增长2.9％。农业生产方面，同一期间，我国粮食产量增长了一点三倍，棉花产量增长了三点七倍，而美国的粮食产量只增长了25.2％，棉花产量不但没有增长，而且下降了28％；英国的粮食产量下降了6.5％。这就是社会主义制度远优于资本主义制度的最有力的明证。
    十年来我国运输邮电事业和国内外商业的发展情况，书中均有详细的资料专篇记述。
    第八篇到第十篇，着重反映了十年来我国文化教育事业的突飞猛进，和人民物质、文化生活的提高情况。
    资料表明，十年来在工农业生产不断增长的基础上，我国工人阶级的队伍空前地壮大了；旧中国遗留下来的失业现象已经消灭，广大劳动人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平显著地提高了。这就是社会主义制度给我国劳动人民已经带来的幸福。
    从以上的很简要的介绍中可以看出，“伟大的十年”是一本内容极为丰富的资料书。一般读者可以从中具体地了解到十年来我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，宣传工作者可以从中得到有力的宣传材料，教育工作者可以从中得到极为丰富的教学材料，经济科学研究工作者也可以从中得到研究中国社会主义经济问题的有关资料。
    值此全国各族人民以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝伟大的建国十周年，热烈祝贺十年来我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗奋勇前进的时候，“伟大的十年”的出版，无疑地，将会更加鼓舞全国各族人民在党和毛泽东同志的领导下从胜利走向更大的胜利。同时，它的出版，也将会更加有力地给那些一贯地诬蔑和攻击我国伟大的社会主义事业，诽谤我国1958年大跃进、人民公社化运动的国内外敌对分子和国内右倾机会主义分子一个迎头的痛击。
