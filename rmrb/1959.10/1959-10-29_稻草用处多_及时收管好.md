Straw Has Many Uses, Collect and Manage It Well

Straw is feed for draught cattle, and also a necessary raw material for boiling saltpeter, making straw paper, making straw sandals, and weaving straw bags. At the same time, it is indispensable for covering houses and padding pig pens. In some areas, it is also used as fuel. Therefore, timely collecting and managing straw well during the autumn harvest is a major task.

Hengshan County in Hunan Province learned from the experience and lessons of last year. Starting from the early rice harvest, it paid attention to the collection and management of rice straw. Before the autumn harvest, various localities made specific plans for rice straw. First, it is necessary to meet the needs of pigs and cattle for year-round fodder and the needs of commune members for building thatched houses. A certain amount is allocated according to the size of draught cattle and the number of pigs, and is collected and kept by pig farmers and cattle farmers themselves. For commune members who need to build thatched houses and use straw for miscellaneous purposes, the production team and work group determine a certain amount, and take the method of discounting the price to collect from the designated place and store it themselves. Secondly, each commune formulated various management plans such as papermaking, saltpeter boiling, and weaving straw bags and straw sandals according to the income and needs of rice straw.

At the time of the early rice harvest, the county party committee made unified arrangements for the timely recovery of rice straw, requiring all localities to collect all the rice straw while harvesting the rice, so as not to delay the season or waste a single rice straw. During the rush harvest period, Baipeng Commune arranged one or two laborers in each work group to specialize in collecting and drying rice straw, and adopted the method of "collecting grain, drying grass, and storing it at the same time" to recover rice straw. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage during the "double rush" period, Datang Brigade of Dapu Commune assigned 216 primary school students to pick up rice straw, using the spare time in the morning and afternoon after class.

This year, many places have a bumper harvest of rice, and there is a large amount of rice straw, so special attention should be paid to the storage and management of rice straw. Before the harvest, NanYue Commune comprehensively inspected the factory sheds and empty houses, and sent bricklayers to repair more than 200 places with leaking rain; storage points were established with work groups as units, and more than 300 factory sheds were established with brigades as units. Shaquan Commune had difficulties in indoor storage, so they adopted the method of burning under the trees and building sheds on the spot. The rice straw that was burned under the trees was all selected in high-lying areas with high terrain and dry soil, and wooden boards or firewood were also placed under the rice straw to avoid mildew and ensure that every straw could be used.

The county's 800,000 mu of rice fields, plus the double-cropping late rice, are expected to yield more than 400 million catties of rice straw. In addition to meeting the needs of draught cattle, pigs, thatched houses and papermaking raw materials, 100 million catties can be used as fuel and for making plant ash. At present, the fodder needed for more than 40,000 draught cattle and 200,000 pigs in the county is mostly stored around the cattle and pig pens, and more than 300 paper mills in the county have also started to produce pulp.

### 稻草用处多  及时收管好

    抓住时机　收贮柴草
    稻草用处多  及时收管好
    稻草是耕牛的饲料，也是熬硝、造草纸、打草鞋、编织草包所必需的原料，同时也是盖房屋、垫猪栏所不可缺少的，还有的地区利用它来当燃料。因此在秋收中及时收好和管理好稻草是件大事情。
    湖南衡山县吸取了去年的经验教训，从早稻开镰收割起，就注意了稻草的收管工作，秋收前，各地对稻草都作了具体规划。首先是满足猪牛全年饲草和社员盖茅房的需要。根据耕牛大小和生猪头数分配一定的数量，由养猪户和养牛户自己收藏保管。部分社员盖茅房和零用稻草，由生产队和作业组确定一定数量，采取折价的办法在指定地点领取，自收自藏。其次，各公社根据稻草收入和需要情况，分别制订了造纸、熬硝、编织草包草鞋等多种经营计划。
    在早稻开镰收割的时候，县委对及时收回稻草作了统一部署，要求各地在收好稻谷的同时，将稻草全部收回来，做到不耽误季节，不浪费一根稻草。白蓬公社在抢收期间，每个作业组安排了一至两个劳力专门收晒稻草，采取“边收谷、边晒草、边收藏”的办法收回稻草。大浦公社圫沅大队为了解决“双抢”期间劳力紧张问题，收稻草这项农活就安排给二百十六个小学生，利用早上和下午课余时间拾稻草。
    今年许多地方稻谷丰收，稻草量大，特别要注意稻草的保管工作。南岳公社在收割前，全面检查了厂棚和空屋，对有漏雨的二百多处地方都派瓦匠进行了修盖；以作业组为单位建立了贮藏据点，以大队为单位建立厂棚三百多个。沙泉公社室内贮存有困难，他们就采取树下打焦和就地搭棚的办法。树下打焦的稻草，都选择了地势高、土质干爽的高坡地带，稻草下面还垫上木板或柴草，以避免霉烂，保证根根能用。
    全县八十万亩稻田，加上双季晚稻，预计可收稻草四亿多万斤。这些稻草除够满足耕牛、生猪、盖茅房和造纸原料的需要外，还有一亿万斤可作为燃料和制草木灰等用。现在全县四万多头耕牛和二十万头生猪所需草料，绝大部份储备到牛猪栏的周围，全县三百多个造纸厂也先后开始生产纸浆。
