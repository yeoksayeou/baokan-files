    Celebrating the Glorious Tenth Anniversary of the German Democratic Republic
    Wang Guoquan, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic
    October 7th of this year marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The people of Germany, the people of China, and peace-loving people all over the world are celebrating this glorious festival. In May 1945, the great Soviet army defeated the Hitler fascist army and liberated the German people from fascist tyranny. After several years of anti-fascist social and democratic reforms by the German working class and other patriotic forces, the first worker-peasant state in German history—the German Democratic Republic—was established on October 7, 1949. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is the result of decades of heroic struggle by the German working class and other peaceful, patriotic forces against German imperialism and militarism, and a great historical victory for the German people. It opened up a historical path for all German people towards peace, democracy, and socialism.
  In the ten years since its founding, the German Democratic Republic has achieved great success in various aspects such as building socialism, opposing West German militarism, and striving for national reunification. As everyone knows, the people of the German Democratic Republic began socialist transformation and socialist construction under the conditions of German division and many difficulties. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the hard work of the broad masses of the people, and the great support and assistance of fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, they quickly restored industrial production and arable land to pre-war levels in 1950. From 1951 to 1955, the first five-year plan was successfully completed. The second five-year plan began in 1956. In order to adapt to the new situation of rapid development of the national economy, the German Democratic Republic incorporated the last two years of the second five-year plan, namely 1959 and 1960, into the new seven-year plan. In 1958, the socialist component accounted for 76.4% of the total social output value of the German Democratic Republic. In the total industrial output value, state-owned enterprises accounted for 88.8%, joint state-private enterprises accounted for 3.2%, and private enterprises accounted for 8%. At present, the cultivated area of ​​state-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives accounts for 50% of the country's cultivated area, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and private commerce has also made great progress. The industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic in 1958 was 241% of that in 1950, and the output of important industrial products has increased several times. In particular, after the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1958 criticized and liquidated right-leaning opportunist ideas, the speed of industrial production greatly accelerated, surpassing the speed of West German industrial growth. For example, in 1957, industrial production in the German Democratic Republic increased by 8%, while West Germany only increased by 5.7%; in 1958, the German Democratic Republic increased by 10.9%, while West Germany only increased by 3.1%. In 1959, the German Democratic Republic plans to increase industrial production by 11.1%. In the first half of this year, it has increased by 12.4% compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that it is entirely possible to reach or exceed the expected target. Due to the rapid industrial development of the German Democratic Republic in recent years, it is therefore possible to complete the industrial production targets of the second five-year plan one year ahead of schedule this year. Today, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic ranks fifth in Europe, and the production of lignite ranks first in the world. In agriculture, the yield per unit area of ​​grain in 1958 reached 2,520 kilograms per hectare (equivalent to an average of 380-400 kilograms per mu of wheat), an increase of more than 20% compared with 1950. In terms of commodity volume of livestock products, compared with 1950, cattle increased by 68%, pigs increased by 219%, and milk increased by 144% in 1958. Agricultural and livestock products have reached self-sufficiency in many aspects or greatly reduced imports. Many agricultural products have surpassed West Germany in terms of per capita output.
    With the rapid development of the national economy, the material and cultural levels of the people of the German Democratic Republic have greatly improved. Compared with 1950, the average monthly salary of employees increased from 256 marks to 409 marks in 1958. The average savings per person in 1958 was 649.73 marks, which was 885.4% of that in 1950. Compared with 1950, in terms of per capita consumption of important means of livelihood in 1958, meat increased from 22.1 kilograms to 50.8 kilograms, oil increased from 11.5 kilograms to 27 kilograms, eggs increased from 63.1 to 181, and sugar increased from 20.2 kilograms to 30.1 kilograms. Since 1957, the German Democratic Republic has implemented a 7.5-hour workday in the industrial sector, reduced prices 22 times since its founding, and abolished the rationing system for major means of livelihood in May 1958. This has played a significant role in increasing people's purchasing power and improving the living standards of the working people.
    The development of cultural and educational undertakings in the German Democratic Republic is extraordinarily rapid. In 1958, the number of higher education institutions doubled compared with 1951. On average, there were 50 university students per 10,000 residents, while West Germany only had 27. 94% of university students enjoy scholarships, which is even beyond the reach of West Germany. Currently, eight-year schools are being converted into ten-year comprehensive technical schools to further improve the cultural level of the people. Over the past ten years, the German Democratic Republic has carried out tremendous work and achieved significant achievements in eliminating the ideological poison of fascism and developing socialist culture and science. In addition, the German Democratic Republic has also seen universal development in social insurance undertakings such as public medical care, childbirth subsidies, and pension disbursements.
    Now the German Democratic Republic has surpassed West Germany in terms of industrial development speed, cultural education, and social insurance. In terms of per capita consumption of important means of livelihood and industrial products, it has respectively approached, caught up with, or surpassed West Germany. Last year, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a battle call to the people of the whole country: by the end of 1961, catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of important means of livelihood and industrial products. The seven-year plan passed by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on October 1 this year is a magnificent and inspiring plan. According to this plan, the investment amount in seven years will reach 142 billion marks, which is more than twice the total investment in the seven years from 1951 to 1957. The labor productivity of state-owned industry will increase by 85% in seven years, and the total industrial output value in 1965 will increase by 88% compared with 1958. Electricity and the chemical industry will have significant development. After the implementation of the seven-year plan, the yield per unit area of ​​crops and the output of meat, milk, and eggs per unit area in the German Democratic Republic will exceed that of West Germany. The actual wages of employees will increase by 60% to 65% in seven years. The living standards of the entire people will also be further improved. The implementation of the seven-year plan will greatly enhance the strength of the German Democratic Republic, thereby further strengthening the strength of the socialist camp. The brilliant achievements and bright prospects of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction since its founding vividly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in a highly developed industrial country.
    While building socialism, the German Democratic Republic has made great efforts and contributions in the struggle against West German militarism and for German reunification. The German Democratic Republic engages in acute struggles with German militarism almost every day. As the declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries held in Moscow in November 1957 once pointed out: "Opposing West German militarism and revanchism that threatens peace is an important task of the peace-loving forces of the German people and the people of European countries. In this struggle, the German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in German history, plays a particularly significant role." Opposing German militarism and striving for German reunification not only relate to the vital national interests of all German people, but also relate to the peace and security of European countries. Over the past ten years, in order to oppose the resurgence of German militarism and strive for the reunification of the motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis, the German Democratic Republic has successively put forward more than 100 positive and beneficial proposals to West Germany. The proposal put forward by the German Democratic Republic in July 1957 for the establishment of a confederation between the two Germanys pointed out a specific path for Germany to return to reunification. At the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference held this year, the German Democratic Republic, together with the Soviet Union, made unremitting efforts to strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty and a reasonable solution to the West Berlin issue. The German Democratic Republic actively proposed the positive suggestion of the two Germanys concluding a non-aggression treaty and establishing an all-German committee to discuss the peace treaty and the issue of reunification. During the conference, millions of residents of the German Democratic Republic signed letters to the delegations of various countries, demanding the realization of the peaceful proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. The Geneva Conference showed that it is impossible to discuss and resolve the German issue without the participation of representatives of the German Democratic Republic. The proposals and efforts of the German Democratic Republic to strive for German reunification have played a significant role in educating and mobilizing the masses of people in East and West Germany to oppose West German militarism and strive for German reunification. It centrally embodies the interests and will of all German people and has won the support and support of all German people. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and many intellectuals, scientists, politicians, and even some capitalists in West Germany also agree with the reasonable proposals of the German Democratic Republic regarding the establishment of a confederation and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the two Germanys, and agree that the two German governments should hold direct talks to discuss the solution to the German issue. In recent years, the struggle of the West German people against West German militarism and atomic armament is developing day by day. In 1958 alone, more than one million people participated in this struggle. The facts clearly show that in the struggle to strive for German reunification, the hearts of the people are towards the German Democratic Republic. The Adenauer clique in West Germany's policy of following the United States in carrying out the Cold War and reviving West German militarism is becoming increasingly unpopular. It can be asserted that the German people's just struggle against West German militarism and for national reunification will surely achieve final victory.
    In international affairs, the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. The German Democratic Republic has made important contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The German Democratic Republic has always attached importance to improving relations with neighboring countries, supporting the national independence movements and people's democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and developing friendly relations with these countries. Premier Grotewohl's trip to Asia and Africa in January this year and the visit of the People's Chamber delegation to India and Ceylon in April promoted friendly relations with these countries. The annual Baltic Sea Peace Week plays an important role in defending the peace of the Baltic Sea and improving relations with neighboring countries. The German Democratic Republic holds the large-scale Leipzig Fair every year, which promotes East-West trade and international cooperation. At present, the German Democratic Republic has established fraternal friendly and cooperative diplomatic relations with eleven socialist countries. It has also established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, and has good consular and commercial relations with Asian and African countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, the United Arab Republic, and Iraq. It has also established consular relations with its northern neighbor, Finland. The German Democratic Republic has trade relations with more than 100 countries and regions in the world. With the further development of the socialist construction cause of the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Republic will play a greater role in international affairs. The United States, West Germany, and other Western countries' foolish practice of "not recognizing the German Democratic Republic" attempts to isolate the German Democratic Republic internationally and hinder the improvement of the German Democratic Republic's status and prestige in the international community. This is obviously a futile attempt.
    The tremendous achievements of the German Democratic Republic in the struggle to maintain peace, strive for national reunification, and build socialism have been achieved thanks to the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the hard work of the people throughout the country, and have been achieved with the great, selfless, and comprehensive assistance and support of socialist countries, especially the great Soviet Union. After the merger of the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party in April 1946 on the basis of Marxism-Leninism to form the Socialist Unity Party, the state of division of the workers' movement caused by reformists and revisionists was forever ended in eastern Germany. This is of decisive significance for the development of the German Democratic Republic and the future of the people throughout the country. Based on the national task of striving for German reunification and the task of building socialism in the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party put forward the guidelines and policies in various revolutionary periods, and resolutely opposed "left" and right-leaning ideas within the party in the process of implementation, especially opposed the right-leaning opportunist sectarian group of Schirdewan and others, consolidated and strengthened the unity within the party, and ensured the party's Marxist-Leninist leadership and the implementation of the party's various policies. In recent years, the party and the government have proposed reorganizing the industrial management system, improving work style, and promoting the system of cadres participating in physical labor under the slogan of "same plan, same labor, same management," thereby greatly strengthening the ties between the party and the masses. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany put forward the strengthening of socialist moral education for party members and the masses, the organization of the nationwide participation in the discussion on the socialist reconstruction of industry and the seven-year plan this year, the socialist labor emulation movement to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and the "socialist labor team" and "socialist work and research collective," "advanced help backward" and other movements this year, marking the further development of the socialist collectivist spirit of the masses, and the improvement of the ideological awareness and work enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, a prosperous new atmosphere has emerged in all aspects of the German Democratic Republic.
    The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic stand tall as outposts of the socialist camp in the East and West, and the people of the two countries have a deep revolutionary friendship. As early as during the First Domestic Revolutionary War in our country, Ernst Thälmann, the outstanding leader of the German working class, called on workers to support the Chinese revolution and oppose German imperialism transporting ammunition and weapons to the Chinese reactionaries. On November 7, 1931, when our country established the Central Workers' and Peasants' Regime headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany headed by Comrade Thälmann sent a warm congratulatory message. The broad masses of Chinese working people have also been watching and supporting the revolutionary struggle of the German working class and the masses of people.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, the friendship between the people of the two countries entered a new stage. Over the past ten years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Germany, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, have been rapidly developed and consolidated. The two countries have successively signed the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, consular, trade, cultural, scientific and technological treaties and agreements. The mutual support and cooperation between the two countries in maintaining world peace, opposing wars of aggression, and international struggles has become increasingly close. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic support our country's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, oppose the United States' plot to create "two Chinas," and maintain Asian and world peace. The government and people of our country also fully support the German Democratic Republic's struggle to maintain European peace, oppose German militarism, and conclude a German peace treaty and resolve the Berlin issue. Based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and promoting the common upsurge of socialist construction in the two countries, trade exchanges and economic cooperation between the two countries have been continuously expanded and developed. The trade volume between the two countries in 1959 increased more than threefold compared with 1951. The German Democratic Republic has provided our country with more than 40 design and supply complete equipment construction projects, which strongly supported our country's socialist construction. So far, 137 groups of 1,306 scientific, artistic, and journalistic people from our country have visited the German Democratic Republic. The two countries have also exchanged teachers and students. All this has promoted mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and the common prosperity of economy and culture. The people of China and Germany, united by the great communist ideals, are now marching shoulder to shoulder on the socialist road with vigorous steps. Undoubtedly, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will also develop with the development of our entire cause, thereby making greater contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, consolidating world peace, and promoting the cause of human progress.
    When celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, we celebrate the achievements of the German Democratic Republic as if they were our own, and celebrate the festival of the people of the German Democratic Republic as if it were our own, cheering for the great achievements already made by the German Democratic Republic, and wishing them new and greater achievements in the struggle for socialist construction and German reunification.

    庆祝德意志民主共和国光荣胜利的十周年
    中华人民共和国驻德意志民主共和国大使　王国权
    今年10月7日是德意志民主共和国成立的十周年。德国人民，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都在庆祝这一光辉的节日。1945年5月，伟大的苏军打败了希特勒法西斯军队，把德国人民从法西斯暴政统治下解放出来。德国工人阶级和其他爱国力量经过了几年的反法西斯的社会改革和民主改革，于1949年10月7日建立了德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国的成立，是德国工人阶级和其他和平、爱国力量数十年来反对德国帝国主义和军国主义英勇斗争的结果，是德意志人民伟大历史性的胜利。它为全德人民打开了走向和平民主和社会主义的历史道路。
  德意志民主共和国建国十年来，在建设社会主义、反对西德军国主义和争取祖国统一等各方面均取得了巨大的成就。大家都知道，德意志民主共和国人民是在德国分裂、困难较多的情况下开始社会主义改造和社会主义建设的。但由于德国统一社会党的正确领导，广大人民的辛勤努力以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的巨大支持和帮助，他们迅速地在1950年就把工业生产和耕地面积恢复到战前水平。从1951年到1955年，胜利完成了第一个五年计划。1956年开始实行第二个五年计划。为了适应国民经济的迅速发展的新形势，德意志民主共和国把第二个五年计划的最后两年，即1959年和1960年，纳入了新的七年计划。1958年，德意志民主共和国社会总产值中，社会主义成分已占76.4％。在工业生产总值中，国营企业占88.8％，公私合营企业占3.2％，私营企业占8％。目前国营农场和农业生产合作社的耕地面积占全国耕地面积的50％，手工业和私营商业的社会主义改造也有了很大的发展。德意志民主共和国1958年的工业产值为1950年的241％，重要工业产品有了成倍的增长。特别是经过1958年统一社会党第五次代表大会批判和清算了右倾机会主义思想，工业生产的速度大大加快，赶过了西德工业增长的速度。如1957年德意志民主共和国工业生产增长了8％，西德只增长了5.7％，1958年德意志民主共和国增长10.9％，西德只增长3.1％。1959年德意志民主共和国计划工业生产增长11.1％，今年上半年已比去年同期增长12.4％，估计完全有可能达到或超过预计的目标。由于德意志民主共和国近几年来工业高速度的发展，因此就有可能在今年提前一年完成第二个五年计划的工业生产指标。今天，德意志民主共和国工业生产已占欧洲第五位，褐煤产量居世界第一位。在农业方面，1958年谷物单位面积产量达到每公顷二千五百二十公斤（小麦折合每亩平均三百八十公斤—四百公斤），比1950年增长20％以上。在畜产品的商品量方面，1958年比1950年，牛增长68％，猪增长219％，牛奶增长144％。农畜产品在许多方面达到了自给自足或大大地减少了进口。有许多农产品在按人口平均计算产量方面已超过西德。
    随着国民经济的迅速发展，德意志民主共和国人民的物质和文化水平有了很大的提高。1958年比1950年，职工每月平均工资由二百五十六马克提高到四百零九马克。1958年平均每人储蓄六百四十九点七三马克，为1950年的885.4％。1958年比1950年，在按人口平均计算的重要生活资料的消费方面，肉类由二十二点一公斤提高到五十点八公斤，油脂由十一点五公斤提高到二十七公斤，鸡蛋由六十三点一个提高到一百八十一个，糖由二十点二公斤提高到三十点一公斤。德意志民主共和国自1957年起在工业部门实行了每天七小时半工作制，建国以来降低物价达二十二次，并于1958年5月废除了主要生活资料的配给制度。这对增加人民的购买力，提高劳动人民的生活水平起了很大的作用。
    德意志民主共和国文化教育事业的发展异常迅速。1958年，高等学校比1951年增加了一倍，平均每一万居民中有大学生五十人，而西德只有二十七人。94％的大学生享有助学金待遇，这更是西德所望尘莫及的。目前正在将八年制学校改为十年制综合技术学校，以进一步提高人民的文化水平。十年来，德意志民主共和国在肃清法西斯主义思想毒害，发展社会主义的文化和科学方面，进行了巨大的工作，取得了重大的成就。此外，德意志民主共和国在公费医疗、生育补助和发放养老金等社会保险事业方面，也有普遍的发展。
    现在德意志民主共和国在工业发展速度、文化教育和社会保险等方面，已经超过了西德。在按人口平均计算的重要生活资料和工业用品的消费量方面，已经分别接近、赶上或超过了西德。去年统一社会党第五次代表大会，向全国人民提出了战斗号召：到1961年年底，在按人口平均计算的重要生活资料和工业用品的消费量方面赶上和超过西德。德意志民主共和国人民议院今年10月1日通过的七年计划是一个宏伟的鼓舞人心的计划。根据这个计划，七年间投资额达一千四百二十亿马克，为1951年至1957年七年间投资总和的二倍多。国营工业的劳动生产率七年内将提高85％，1965年的工业总产值将比1958年增加88％。电力、化学工业将有显著发展。实现了七年计划，德意志民主共和国农作物的单位面积产量和按单位面积平均计算的肉类、牛奶和蛋类的产量，将超过西德。七年内职工实际工资将提高60％到65％。整个人民生活水平也将有进一步的提高。实现了七年计划，将大大增强德意志民主共和国的力量，从而也将进一步增强社会主义阵营的力量。德意志民主共和国建国以来在社会主义建设方面所获得的辉煌成就及其光辉远景，鲜明地显示了在一个工业高度发达的国家里社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。
    德意志民主共和国在建设社会主义的同时，在反对西德军国主义、争取德国统一的斗争中，作出了巨大的努力和贡献。德意志民主共和国几乎每天都同德国军国主义进行尖锐的斗争。正如1957年11月在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言所曾经指出的：“反对威胁着和平的西德军国主义和复仇主义，是德国人民爱好和平的力量和欧洲各国人民的重要任务。在这个斗争中，德国历史上第一个工农国家德意志民主共和国，起着特别巨大的作用。”反对德国军国主义，争取德国统一不仅是关系到全体德国人民切身的民族利益，而且关系到欧洲各国的和平与安全。十年来，德意志民主共和国为反对德国军国主义再起和争取在和平民主基础上统一祖国，先后向西德提出了一百多次积极有益的建议。德意志民主共和国在1957年7月提出的两个德国成立邦联的建议，指出了德国重新走向统一的具体道路。在今年召开的日内瓦外长会议上，德意志民主共和国和苏联一起，为争取缔结对德和约和合理解决西柏林问题作了不懈的努力。德意志民主共和国主动提出了两个德国缔结互不侵犯条约和成立全德委员会以讨论和约和统一问题的积极性建议。会议期间，德意志民主共和国成百万居民签名写信给各国代表团，要求实现苏联和德意志民主共和国的和平建议。日内瓦会议表明：没有德意志民主共和国代表的参加就不可能讨论和解决德国问题。德意志民主共和国争取德国统一的建议和努力，对于教育和动员东西德人民群众反对西德军国主义，争取德国统一的斗争起了很大的作用。它集中地体现了全德人民的利益和意志，得到了全体德国人民的拥护和支持。西德广大的工人、农民和许多知识分子、科学家、政治家，甚至有一些资本家也都赞成德意志民主共和国关于成立邦联、两个德国缔结互不侵犯条约的合理主张，赞成两个德国政府直接举行会谈，商讨解决德国问题。近年来，西德人民反对西德军国主义和原子武装的斗争正在日益发展，仅1958年参加这个斗争的就有一百多万人。事实非常清楚地说明，在争取德国统一的斗争上，人心是向着德意志民主共和国的。西德阿登纳集团追随美国进行冷战和复活西德军国主义的政策愈来愈不得人心。可以断言，德国人民反对西德军国主义和争取祖国统一的正义斗争，必将取得最后的胜利。
    在国际上，德意志民主共和国一贯执行和平外交政策。德意志民主共和国在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面作出了重要的贡献。德意志民主共和国一贯重视改善同邻国的关系，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动和人民民主运动，发展同这些国家的友好关系。今年1月格罗提渥总理的亚非之行和4月人民议院代表团在印度和锡兰的访问，增进了同这些国家的友好关系。每年举行的波罗的海和平周，对于保卫波罗的海的和平和改善同邻国的关系，有着重要的作用。德意志民主共和国每年举办规模宏大的莱比锡博览会，促进了东西方贸易和国际合作。现在德意志民主共和国已同十一个社会主义国家建立了兄弟般的友好合作的外交关系。同南斯拉夫也建立了外交关系，同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿联、伊拉克等亚非国家有着良好的领事和商务关系，同它的北方邻国芬兰也建立了领事关系；德意志民主共和国同世界上一百多个国家和地区有着贸易关系。随着德意志民主共和国社会主义建设事业的进一步发展，德意志民主共和国将在国际事务中发挥更大的作用。美国、西德和其他西方国家以“不承认德意志民主共和国”的愚蠢的作法，企图在国际上孤立德意志民主共和国，阻挠德意志民主共和国在国际上的地位和威望的提高，这显然是枉费心机的。
    德意志民主共和国在维护和平、争取祖国统一和建设社会主义的斗争中的巨大成就，是由于德国统一社会党的正确领导和全国人民的辛勤努力而取得的，是在社会主义国家特别是伟大苏联巨大、无私和全面的援助和支持下取得的。1946年4月间德国共产党和社会民主党在马克思列宁主义的基础上合并组成为统一社会党以后，在德国东部永远结束了改良主义者和修正主义者所造成的工人运动分裂状态。这对于德意志民主共和国的发展和全国人民的前途具有决定性的意义。统一社会党根据争取德国统一的民族任务和在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的任务，提出了在各个革命时期的方针政策，并在执行过程中坚决反对了党内的“左”倾和右倾思想，特别是反对了希德万等人的右倾机会主义宗派集团，巩固和加强了党内的团结，保证了党的马克思列宁主义的领导和党的各项政策的贯彻。近年来，党和政府提出了改组工业管理的体制，改进工作作风，在“同计划、同劳动、同管理”的口号下，推行了干部参加体力劳动制度，从而大大加强了党和群众的联系。德国统一社会党第五次代表大会提出的加强对党员和人民群众的社会主义道德教育、今年组织的全国人民参加关于工业的社会主义改建和七年计划的讨论、迎接建国十周年的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，以及今年的“社会主义劳动队”和“社会主义工作和研究集体”、“先进帮助落后”等运动，标志着人民群众社会主义集体主义精神的进一步的发扬，人民群众思想觉悟和劳动积极性的提高。这样，就使德意志民主共和国在各个方面出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国分别屹立在社会主义阵营的东西方前哨，两国人民间有着深厚的革命友谊。远在我国第一次国内革命战争时期，德国工人阶级的杰出领袖恩斯特·台尔曼就号召工人支持中国革命，反对德国帝国主义运送弹药武器给中国反动派。1931年11月7日，我国在江西瑞金成立了以毛泽东同志为首的中央工农政权时，以台尔曼同志为首的德国共产党中央拍来了热情的贺电。中国广大劳动人民也一直注视和支持德国工人阶级和人民群众的革命斗争。
    在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国成立以后，两国人民的友谊进入了一个新的阶段。十年来，建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的中德两国友好合作关系，得到了迅速的发展和巩固。两国先后签订了中德友好合作条约、领事、贸易、文化、科学技术等条约和协定。两国在维护世界和平、反对侵略战争和国际斗争中相互支持和合作日益密切。德意志民主共和国政府和人民支持我国解放台湾、反对美国制造“两个中国”阴谋的正义斗争和维护亚洲和世界和平的努力。我国政府和人民也全力支持德意志民主共和国为维护欧洲和平、反对德国军国主义以及为缔结对德和约、解决柏林问题的斗争。根据平等、互利和促进两国社会主义建设共同高涨的原则，两国的贸易往来和经济合作得到了不断扩大和发展。两国的贸易额1959年较1951年增加了三倍多。德意志民主共和国为我国提供设计和供应成套设备的建设项目有四十多个，有力地支援了我国的社会主义建设。到目前为止，我国已有一百三十七起一千三百零六位科学、艺术和新闻界人士访问了德意志民主共和国。两国还交换了教师和留学生。这一切都促进了两国人民的相互了解和经济文化的共同繁荣。由伟大的共产主义理想团结起来的中德两国人民，今天正以矫健的步伐在社会主义大道上并肩前进。无疑的，我们两国人民的友好合作关系，也将随着我们的整个事业的发展而发展，从而为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，巩固世界和平和促进人类进步事业作出更大的贡献。
    在庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十周年的时候，我们把德意志民主共和国的成就看成是自己的成就一样，把德意志民主共和国人民的节日看成是自己的节日一样热烈庆祝，为德意志民主共和国已经取得的伟大成就而欢呼，并预祝他们在社会主义建设和争取德国统一的斗争中获得新的更大的成就。
