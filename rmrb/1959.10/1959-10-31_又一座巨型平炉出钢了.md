    Another Giant Open Hearth Furnace Produces Steel

    The No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), equipped with the latest technology, has produced steel. It is twice the size of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace and can produce 300,000 tons of steel annually, equivalent to twice China's total steel production in 1949. This open-hearth furnace project is huge and technically complex. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, WISCO builders shortened the construction period of many individual projects by seven to twenty-nine days compared to the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, and the quality was excellent after inspection. As we celebrate this "King of Open-hearth Furnaces" joining the battle, we sincerely congratulate the WISCO builders for comprehensively implementing the general construction policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the construction of this giant project.

    With the No. 2 open-hearth furnace put into production, the first phase of WISCO's iron-smelting system has been basically completed, and the steel-smelting system has also taken initial shape, achieving "high-speed development and comprehensive leap forward" achievements. WISCO's "high-speed development and comprehensive leap forward" achievements illustrate two points: First, it is absolutely not the case, as some people say, that the Great Leap Forward "dispersed forces and hindered key construction." On the contrary, the Party's general line for socialist construction and the two-legs-walking policy for realizing the general line have not only promoted the leap-forward development of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters, making them dotted all over the country and forming a major force in China's steel industry; but also promoted the leap-forward development of key national construction projects like WISCO, enabling it to grow rapidly and form, together with Anshan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel, the backbone of China's socialist industrialization, playing their key role in socialist construction. The simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises has enabled China to reach the steel production target of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. Second, it is absolutely not as some people imagine that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and that "better" and "more economical" cannot be achieved if "greater" and "faster" are pursued. On the contrary, as long as we can correctly grasp and apply the laws of objective things and actively give play to the subjective initiative of people, we can promote the high-speed development of things and achieve comprehensive leap-forward achievements in the process of unifying these relationships, and comprehensively implement the general line of socialist construction.

    The reason why WISCO has achieved high-speed development and comprehensive leap-forward achievements is not because of any special conditions, but mainly because they have adhered to putting politics in command, the unified leadership of the Party committee, and the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements. Taking the Industrial Installation Company, which undertook the largest task of installing the steel-smelting project, as an example, in May and June, when right-leaning, fear-of-difficulty sentiments were growing in the minds of a few cadres, the result was that after half of the construction period had passed, only a quarter of the task had been completed. After the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was conveyed, they went deep into the steel-smelting construction site in the anti-rightist and morale-boosting campaign, led by the Party committee secretary and more than forty section-level cadres, eating, living, and laboring with the workers, and solving problems in a timely and proactive manner. The workers were also in high spirits, working hard and cleverly, and implemented hourly checks on the plan by shift, launching a heated labor emulation campaign to catch up with each other. At the same time, the entire WISCO launched a communist large-scale collaboration centered on the steel-smelting project, giving whatever was needed on the spot, and giving it whenever it was needed. In this way, they completed the installation of the twenty-eight steel-smelting projects of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace system in two months of hard work. Immediately afterwards, they summed up experience, further improved construction management and construction methods, and advanced victoriously, completing the installation of the metal components of the No. 2 giant open-hearth furnace in sixteen days, twenty-nine days less than the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, and with good quality and low cost. This clear contrast shows that the Party's policy of anti-rightism and boosting morale is not only necessary in production units, but also completely necessary and correct in construction units.

    As we celebrate the production of steel from the No. 2 open-hearth furnace today, congratulate the WISCO builders, and thank the Soviet comrades who helped build WISCO, we wish all WISCO employees a victorious and early entry into 1960!

### 又一座巨型平炉出钢了

    又一座巨型平炉出钢了
    以最新技术装备起来的武钢二号平炉出钢了，它比一号平炉大一倍，一年能产钢三十万吨，相当于我国1949年全年钢产量的两倍。这座平炉工程巨大，技术复杂。武钢建设者们却在苏联专家的指导下，使它的许多单项工程的工期都分别比一号平炉缩短了七天至二十九天，并且经过检验，质量优良。当我们庆祝这座“平炉之王”参战的时候，衷心祝贺武钢建设者们在建设这个巨型工程中全面贯彻了多快好省的建设方针。
    二号平炉投入生产以后，武钢第一期建设的炼铁体系基本竣工了，炼钢体系也初步形成了，取得了“高速发展，全面跃进”的成就。武钢这
  种“高速发展，全面跃进”的成就，向我们说明了两个问题：一个是绝不像某些人说的大跃进“分散了力量，妨碍了重点建设”。恰恰相反，党的社会主义建设总路线和实现总路线的两条腿走路的方针，既促进了中小型高炉、转炉的飞跃发展，使它们在全国星罗棋布，组成了我国钢铁工业的一支重大队伍；也促进了武钢这样的国家建设重点的飞跃发展，使它迅速成长起来，同鞍钢、包钢一起构成了我国社会主义工业化的支柱，在社会主义建设中发挥它们的骨干作用。大中小企业的同时并举，便使我国能够提前在今年达到第二个五年计划的钢产量的指标。一个是绝不像某些人所想像的，多快好省存在着不可统一的矛盾，要“多”“快”便不能“好”“省”。恰恰相反，只要我们能正确掌握和运用客观事物发展的规律，并积极发挥人的主观能动作用，就能在统一这些关系的过程中促进事物的高速发展，并取得全面跃进的成就，全面贯彻社会主义建设总路线。
    武钢所以取得高速发展，全面跃进的成就，并没有什么特殊条件，而主要是他们坚持了政治挂帅，党委统一领导，坚持了集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针。以担负炼钢工程安装任务最大的工业安装公司为例来看，5、6月间，当右倾畏难情绪正在少数干部思想上滋长的时候，结果工期过了一半，任务只完成四分之一。当八届八中全会精神下达以后，他们便在反右倾、鼓干劲中，由党委书记率领四十多名科级干部深入炼钢工地，与工人同吃同住同劳动，及时主动解决问题。工人们也意气风发，苦干巧干，并实行按班、按小时检查计划，掀起了一场你追我赶的劳动竞赛热潮。同时，全武钢也以炼钢工程为中心展开共产主义大协作，现场要什么就给什么，什么时候要就什么时候给。这样，他们苦战两月，便将一号平炉系统的二十八项炼钢工程安装完毕。紧跟着，他们又总结经验，进一步改进施工管理和施工方法，乘胜前进，将二号巨型平炉的金属构件在十六天里安装完毕，比一号平炉少用二十九天，并且质量好，成本低。这个鲜明的对比，说明了党的反右倾鼓干劲方针，不仅在生产单位是必要的，而且在建设单位也是完全必要的，正确的。
    在我们今天庆祝二号平炉出钢，向武钢建设者们祝贺，向帮助武钢建设的苏联同志致谢的时候，我们预祝武钢全体职工胜利地提前跨进1960年！
