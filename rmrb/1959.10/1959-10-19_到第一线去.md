　　Go to the Front Lines
　　Kong Sang
　　A thin white line appears far on the horizon. People who have lived by the sea for a long time know that the tide is coming.

　　Leading cadres arrive at the construction site with their luggage. People who experienced the unforgettable battles of 1958 know that a new production upsurge and a new Great Leap Forward are about to begin.

　　This has almost become a universal sign of this year's production upsurge: wherever cadres arrive at the production site, mass movements follow. The Party issued a call: "Oppose Rightism, boost morale." From all corners of the country, tens of thousands of cadres immediately rushed to the production front lines. In less than two or three weeks, a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy unfolded rapidly. Having learned from the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, everyone deeply understands that cadres going to the front lines to participate in labor is the first step and also the key step in launching mass movements.

　　After the deputy mayor of Jinan City and the deputy directors of the Electric Power Bureau and the Construction Engineering Bureau went deep into the construction site, the workers said: "The old Eighth Route Army is back, and our enthusiasm will be even greater than in 1958." Cai Yuqing, a worker at the Harbin Bearing Factory, enthusiastically praised the factory director, Cui Shaowu, for turning their "old ox cart" into a "thousand-mile horse" after he came to their workshop to participate in labor. How much encouragement can leading cadres give to workers by going down to the workshops and construction sites!

　　Why does cadre participation in labor have such a great effect? This is because cadre participation in physical labor, appearing among the masses as ordinary workers, further improves the relationship between cadres and the masses, raises the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and strengthens their trust and love for cadres. This was an important factor in the Great Leap Forward last year and is also an important driving force for the new production upsurge this year.

　　From the perspective of leadership methods, this is also a major reform. It enables leading cadres to deeply contact objective reality, allowing them to examine their leadership from their opposite position – the position of being led. In this way, they can discover and solve problems in a timely manner, avoid subjectivism, and most fully rely on the masses and concentrate the wisdom of the masses. The fact that the Lingxi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province has comprehensively completed its plan for fourteen consecutive months, and that the forging workshop of the Harbin Bearing Factory has rapidly transformed from backward to advanced, are powerful proofs.

　　Since this is the case, why are there still some leading cadres who are unwilling to go down?

　　There are two types of people here. One type acknowledges the significant role of cadres participating in labor; however, because of "too few people and too much work," they "want to go down but can't." Regarding this type of person, the Jinan Railway Bureau's Engineering Section conducted a very good analysis in a discussion. Comrades there presented many facts, explaining that what they said in the past about "too few people and too much work" was just an excuse. The real reason for not going down, as Sun Xiushan, the general branch propaganda committee member of this engineering section, confessed: "The main reason is insufficient enthusiasm, getting by, and seeking comfort, so I am afraid to go down." These comrades examined and criticized their slack mood, renewed their enthusiasm, and happily went down to the grassroots.

　　Some others are fundamentally different from these comrades. They oppose cadres participating in labor. They believe that cadres are special figures, "mental laborers," people who solve major problems. When it comes to production, it is enough for leading cadres to formulate plans, issue orders, and for workers to execute them accordingly. Letting cadres work alongside workers, covered in grease, is simply a "waste of talent and formalism." These people are full of bourgeois ideas and are stumbling blocks to the Great Leap Forward. We must wage a resolute struggle against this type of person. Cadre participation in labor is a touchstone. Opposing cadre participation in labor is opposing mass movements and opposing the Great Leap Forward; persisting in going to the site and promoting production together with the masses is the loyal socialist builder and the true promoter. The line between right and wrong is so clear, and there is absolutely no room for compromise.

　　Leading comrades in enterprises, the battle drums are beating faster and faster. Those who have not yet gone down to the grassroots, quickly prepare and go to the front lines. The soldiers are waiting for you, and new victories are waiting for you.

　　到第一线去
　　孔桑
    远远的天边出现一条细细的白线。久住海边的人知道：这是海潮就要到来了。
    领导干部带着行李来到工地。经过1958年难忘的战斗的人们知道，新的生产高潮，新的大跃进，又要开始了。
    这几乎成为今年生产高潮的一个普遍的标志：哪里的干部一到生产现场，哪里的群众运动就接踵而起。党一声号召：“反右倾，鼓干劲。”山南海北，成千成万的干部马上奔赴生产第一线。不到半月二十天，全国范围的增产节约运动就迅猛地展开了。大家有了去年大跃进的经验，深深体会到干部亲临前线参加劳动，是掀起群众运动的第一步，也是关键性的一步。
    济南市的副市长、电业局和建工局的副局长深入工地以后，工人们说：“老八路又来了，咱们的干劲要比1958年更足。”哈尔滨轴承厂工人蔡玉清热情地赞扬厂长崔绍武到他们车间参加劳动以后，使他们这个“老牛车”变成了“千里驹”。领导干部下到车间、工地，能给工人多么大的鼓舞啊！
    为什么干部参加劳动有这样大的作用？这是因为，干部参加体力劳动，以普通劳动者的面貌在群众中出现，就进一步改善了干部和群众之间的关系，提高了群众的革命积极性，加强了他们对于干部的信任和爱戴。这是去年大跃进的一个重要因素，也是今年生产新高潮的一个重要动力。
    从领导方法上说，这也是一个重大的改革。它使领导干部深入地接触客观实际，使他们从自己的对立面——被领导的地位来考察自己的领导。这样，他们就能够及时发现问题，解决问题，避免主观主义，并且能够最充分地依靠群众，集中群众的智慧。黑龙江岭西煤矿连续十四个月全面完成计划，哈尔滨轴承厂锻工车间迅速由落后变为先进，都是有力的证明。
    既然如此，为什么还有一些领导干部不肯下去呢？
    这里有两种人。一种人承认干部参加劳动的重大作用；但是因为“人手少，工作忙”，“想下去而下不去。”对于这种人，南京铁路局工务段在一场讨论中作了很好的分析。那里的同志提出了很多事实，说明自己过去讲的“人手少，工作忙”只不过是借口。不下去的真实原因，正如这个工务段的总支宣传委员孙秀山所检讨的：“主要是干劲不足，得过且过，贪图安逸，因此怕下去。”这些同志检查、批判了松劲情绪，重新鼓起干劲，愉快地下到基层去了。
    另一些人和这些同志有根本的区别。他们反对干部参加劳动。他们认为干部是一种特殊人物，是“脑力劳动者”，是解决重大问题的人。搞生产，只要由领导干部制定计划，发布命令，工人照样执行就成了。让干部满身油腻地同工人一起劳动，简直是“浪费人材，形式主义”。这种人满脑子的资产阶级观点，是大跃进的绊脚石。对这种人，我们要进行坚决的斗争。干部参加劳动，这是块试金石。反对干部参加劳动，就是反对群众运动，反对大跃进；坚持下现场同群众一起推进生产，才是忠实的社会主义建设者，真正的促进派。是与非的界限就是这样清楚，中间决没有妥协的道路。
    企业里的领导同志们，战鼓越敲越紧了，还没有下到基层去的，赶快整装上阵，到第一线去。战士们在等待着你，新的胜利在等待着你。
