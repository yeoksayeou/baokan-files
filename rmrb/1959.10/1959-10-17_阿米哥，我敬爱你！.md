　　Amigo, I Admire and Love You!

    In Germany in 1939, the shadow of brown terror loomed large. Fascists ran rampant, and progressive people were constantly in danger of being subjected to extremely cruel persecution and suppression. The German Democratic Republic film "They Called Him 'Amigo'" depicts the story of a fifteen-year-old boy, Reinette, who heroically rescued an underground worker who had just escaped from a concentration camp and was being hunted by the Gestapo in this atmosphere of terror.
    Amigo's father was a railway worker and a Communist Party member who had been imprisoned in a concentration camp. His father's education and the bloody reality made young Amigo hate the brutality of the fascists. Knowing the danger the political prisoner was in, he resolutely tried to find ways to help him. Finally, in a moment of crisis, in order to divert the enemy's search target and protect his underground comrades, he stepped forward. Both he and his father were imprisoned in a concentration camp by the enemy. After suffering all kinds of torture, they were liberated by the Soviet Red Army in 1945.
    Amigo countered inhuman atrocities with human behavior. His courage and steadfastness towards the revolution profoundly educated every audience member. This is a film that expresses simple heroic behavior, inspiring people to be vigilant against fascist atrocities and giving the youth in the construction and consolidation of a new socialist life infinite inspiration and strength.
    Although the story of this film is simple, it is very characteristic. It does not provide overly detailed descriptions and portrayals of the characters' psychology and social environment; it is simple and clear. However, it gives appropriate and meticulous artistic treatment to the plot necessary for the story's development. The plot, full of revolutionary passion and drama, infects the audience from beginning to end, yet there is no trace of artificial twists and turns. For example, the scene where the detectives come to capture Amigo and his father uses the expressive, frightened, and disdainful gazes of the children playing in the backyard, who take their toys and hide inside, to show people's disgust and anger towards the fascists. Furthermore, the detectives' interrogation of the Sina father and son, sometimes hypocritical and sometimes erupting into bestial behavior, fully portrays the sinister and vicious face of the Gestapo killing machine. Amigo's small actions—bringing a cigarette to the underground worker, secretly taking away his father's leather jacket and boots—profoundly express how thoughtfully this young mind was planning the comrade's escape from danger, and his concern and care for his comrade.
    The actor playing Amigo successfully completed the artistic creation of this character who is in a difficult and conflicting situation. He portrayed the immature character of a fifteen-year-old child, and also showed the seriousness and steadfastness of a revolutionary fighter who is accomplishing a great cause. He makes us feel deep sympathy and indignation for his struggle in the concentration camp, move to tears by his heroic act of standing up in front of the detectives, and feel proud of him for being liberated, gloriously joining the People's Army, and proudly smiling as he stands on a tank during a parade. We cheer for him and deeply congratulate him. We also deeply congratulate the thousands upon thousands of young builders in the German Democratic Republic who, like him, stand at the forefront of defending world peace and safeguarding national unity, and wish them even greater victories in the cause of building a socialist motherland!

　　阿米哥，我敬爱你！

    1939年的德意志，满布着褐色恐怖的阴影，法西斯分子横行霸道，进步的人们随时都有着遭到极端残忍的迫害和镇压的危险。德意志民主共和国影片“他们叫他‘阿米哥’”，就是描写在这种恐怖的氛围中，一个十五岁的少年莱因奈，英勇地抢救了在盖世太保追捕下的刚逃出集中营的地下工作者的故事。
    阿米哥的父亲是铁路工人、共产党员，曾经被关在集中营。父亲的教育和血腥的现实，使年轻的阿米哥痛恨法西斯的暴虐，深知这个政治犯处境的危险，他毅然决然地想方设法来搭救他。最后，在千钧一发之际，他为了转移敌人搜索目标，掩护地下工作同志，挺身而出，自己和父亲都被敌人关进了集中营。经受了千万种折磨，直到1945年才被苏联红军解放出来。
    阿米哥以人的行为对抗了非人的暴行，他对革命的勇敢和坚贞，深刻地教育了每一个观众。这是一部表现了朴实的英雄行为的影片，激发人们对法西斯兽行的警惕，给予我们在建设和巩固社会主义新生活的青年无限的启发和力量。
    这部影片故事虽然简单，却很有特点。它没有对人物心理和社会环境进行过于细致的描写与刻划，简单明了，但对故事发展所必要的情节，都给予了适当而精细的艺术处理，充满革命激情和戏剧性的情节，自始至终感染着观众，却毫无人为的曲折描写的痕迹。比如警探们来捕捉阿米哥父子那一场戏，通过在后院玩耍的儿童富于表情的惊恐和鄙弃的目光，纷纷拿着自己的玩具避到家里的镜头，表现了人们对法西斯分子的厌恶和愤怒。又如警探们拷问席那父子那时而伪善、时而兽行发作的镜头，更充分地把杀人机器盖世太保的阴险、毒辣面貌完全勾画了出来。阿米哥的几个小动作：给地下工作者带去一支香烟，偷偷取走父亲的皮衣和靴子……，深刻地表达出了在这个幼小心灵中，他是多么设想周到地在为同志策划逃出虎口的妙计，和他对同志的关心和爱护。
    扮演阿米哥的演员，很好地完成了这个处在困难和富有冲突的处境的角色的艺术创造。他表现了十五岁孩子的不成熟的性格，也显示了正在完成伟大事业的革命战士的严肃和坚贞。他让我们为他挣扎在集中营寄予深切的同情和愤慨，为他挺身站立在警探跟前的英雄行为激动得流泪，为他获得解放，光荣参加了人民军队，傲然含笑站立在坦克车上游行示威而感到骄傲，向他欢呼，深深地为他祝贺。我们也深深祝贺同他一样站在保卫世界和平，维护祖国统一最前线的千千万万德意志民主共和国的青年建设者们，在建设社会主义祖国的事业中，获得更大的胜利！
