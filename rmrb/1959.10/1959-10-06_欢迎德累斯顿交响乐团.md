    Welcome to the Dresden Symphony Orchestra
    Ma Sicong, Vice President of the Sino-German Friendship Association and President of the Central Conservatory of Music
    The world-famous Dresden Symphony Orchestra of the German Democratic Republic has come to China to perform during our grand National Day celebrations, adding more joy and splendor to our brilliant and colorful festival. We warmly welcome their arrival with gratitude.
    The Dresden Symphony Orchestra has a long history, founded in 1870. It is a musical group that has reached the pinnacle of art through trials and tribulations. It frequently tours major cities in Europe and South America, where it has been warmly welcomed and appreciated by an ever-growing audience.
    Today, the Dresden Orchestra enjoys the highest reputation among European symphony orchestras. This reputation is primarily due to the tireless guidance of Professor Heinz Bongartz. Conductors and performers from all over the world who have played with the orchestra have praised its round and harmonious performance, its sonorous and clear tone, and the high artistic level of its members with excitement. In all the pieces they perform, every phrase, even the smallest detail, is handled meticulously, and the tones and timbres are full and moving.
    German symphonic music has a glorious tradition. The development of European symphonic music found its most fertile ground in Germany. Over the past two centuries, the history of German music has seen the emergence of many outstanding musical masters such as Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Weber, Wagner, Strauss. These great names have reached insurmountable peaks in the history of world music culture. The development of German symphonic music has not stopped for two centuries. In Haydn's time, the number of symphony orchestra members was very small, often only ten to twenty. Haydn wrote more than a hundred symphonies for these small orchestras; the development of symphony orchestras gradually expanded, and some instruments were gradually improved to become what they are today. It can be seen that the development of European symphony orchestras has risen in a straight line to reach its increasingly perfect scale. We know that composers such as Mendelssohn, Wagner, Mahler, and Strauss are all outstanding orchestra conductors. Composers not only strive to enrich the expressive power of symphonic music with the content of the music, but also gradually make the orchestra the most beautiful and perfect tool for expressing human emotions in terms of performance techniques, gradually making symphonic music an indispensable spiritual food in people's lives.
    The Dresden Symphony Orchestra regards serving the working people perfectly with musical art as its duty. The orchestra has long conducted its work not only to satisfy the people of its own country, but also to make foreign audiences feel great pleasure from hearing the orchestra's outstanding performances.
    The orchestra holds seventy concerts annually in the Dresden Congress Hall, performs multiple "Night Music" performances in the summer, and performs Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and other pieces at music festivals; it also holds concerts for schools, youth organizations of the Free German Youth League, state-owned factories, and various large enterprises. The hard work of the orchestra members and conductors can be seen from the above-mentioned various musical performances and the large number of performances. Domestic and foreign audiences always reciprocate their efforts with gratitude. This world-renowned Dresden Orchestra is now coming to our country to meet our audience, and it will surely be loved and admired by all listeners.
    As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of our founding, the people of the German Democratic Republic are also joyfully celebrating the great festival of the tenth anniversary of their founding. Our two peoples are advancing towards the highest ideal of socialist communism with the same belief and ambition in the common cause of building our own countries into strong socialist countries, and the brotherly friendship between our two peoples is also growing day by day.
    The Dresden Symphony Orchestra, which has come to our country from thousands of miles away, not only brings us the best music, but also symbolizes the lofty friendship between our two countries.
    Let us sincerely congratulate the orchestra on its successful performances!

    欢迎德累斯顿交响乐团
    中德友好协会副会长中央音乐学院院长  马思聪
    世界著名的民主德国德累斯顿交响乐团，在我们建国十周年的盛大节日，到我国来进行访问演出，给我们灿烂多彩的节日，增添了更多的愉快和光彩，我们以感激的心情，热忱地欢迎他们的到来。
    德累斯顿交响乐团有着长远的历史，它成立于1870年，是一个经过千锤百炼而达到了艺术高峰的音乐团体。它经常在欧洲、南美洲的各大城市作访问演出，并且到处受到了越来越多的广大听众的热烈欢迎和赞赏。
    现在，在欧洲的交响乐团中，德累斯顿乐团有着最高的声誉，乐团声誉首先应当归功于海兹·波恩格兹教授那种诲人不倦的指导。世界各地的指挥家或演奏家，如果和乐团一起演奏过，都会以兴奋的心情来称赞乐团的演奏的圆浑和谐、音色铿锵、清朗，同时感到乐团成员们具有的很高的艺术水平。他们在一切演出的乐曲中，每一乐句、甚至最细微的地方，都处理得一丝不苟，在音调音色上都是丰满而动人。
    德国的交响乐本来就有着光辉的传统，欧洲交响乐的发展，在德国找到它最肥沃的土地。近二百年以来，在德国的音乐史上，先后出现了巴哈、韩德尔、海顿、莫差特、贝多芬、舒伯特、舒曼、孟德尔逊、韦伯、华格纳、斯托劳斯等许多杰出的音乐大师。这些伟大的名字在世界音乐文化史上都达到了难以攀登的高峰。德国交响乐的发展，从两个世纪以来就未停止过，在海顿的时代，交响乐队人数很少，常常只是十至二十多个队员。海顿为这些小乐队写了一百多个交响乐；交响乐队的发展是逐渐扩大起来的，有一些乐器也经过逐渐改良才成为今天的样子。可以看到，欧洲交响乐队的发展是以直线上升而达到它的日臻完善的规模。我们知道，作曲家像孟德尔逊、华格纳、马勒、斯托劳斯，都是杰出的乐队指挥家，作曲家们不仅以乐曲的内容来力求丰富交响乐的表现力量，同时还从演奏技术上使乐队日益成为最美妙、最完善的表达人类感情的工具，逐渐使交响乐成为人民生活中一种不可缺少的精神食粮。
    德累斯顿交响乐团把音乐艺术完美地为劳动人民服务，作为自己的职责。乐团长期地把工作进行得不仅使本国人民满意，同时外国听众也常常因为听到乐团卓越的演出而感到莫大的愉快。
    乐团每年要在德累斯顿会议大厅举行七十次音乐会，夏季演奏多次“夜乐”，音乐节演奏贝多芬第九交响乐等乐曲；还给学校、自由德意志青年联盟的青年组织、国营工厂和各种大型企业等单位举行音乐会。乐团团员们和指挥所付出的辛劳，可以从上述的各种音乐演出和这样大数量的演出场数看出来。国内和国外的听众对他们的努力，也总是报以感激的心情。这个举世闻名的德累斯顿乐团现在来到我国，和我们的听众见面，一定会得到所有听众的爱戴和敬仰。
    在庆祝我们建国十周年之际，德意志民主共和国人民，也正在欢欣鼓舞地迎接建国十周年的伟大节日，我们两国人民，在把自己的祖国建成富强的社会主义国家的共同事业上，是抱着同样的信念和雄心向着人类最高的理想社会主义共产主义迈进的，我们两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊也是与日俱增的。
    这次从千里以外来到我国的德累斯顿交响乐团，不仅给我们带来了最好的音乐，同时也标志着我们两国之间的崇高友谊。
    让我们衷心地祝贺乐团演出的成功！
