　　On Steadfastness
　　Yao Wenyuan
    The history from 1957 to now, a short two years or so, is extremely rich. Everyone has experienced two high tides of class struggle and two tests. The great storm of class struggle is truly like a socialist university, educating cadres and hundreds of millions of working people.

      “Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future.” The ebb and flow of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue for a long time to come, and will continue to appear in different forms on different issues. The lessons of the struggle are worth pondering by every revolutionary. One of the most fundamental lessons is not to waver in the face of adverse winds and currents, and above all, not to waver on major issues. No matter what wind blows from the sky, no matter what waves rise in the sea, the ship of work and life must advance unswervingly in the direction indicated by the compass needle of the general line. The course pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the fastest, most correct, and smoothest course, the course of truth. If we waver and deviate from this direction, the ship will have problems. Small deviations lead to small problems, large deviations lead to large problems, and a 90-degree turn will lead to reef collisions, grounding, and even sinking.

    How can we firmly and unswervingly advance along the direction of the general line? Everyone has their own experience. From the perspective of the struggle on the ideological front, I think the following are very important:

    First, stability. Stability means standing firm on the proletarian stand. No matter what wind or rain comes, this basic class stand must not waver. Our ideal is communism, and what we are currently carrying out is socialist revolution and socialist construction. The guiding light illuminating our path forward is the general line. Within a certain historical period, these will never change. No matter what local shortcomings we have to correct in a specific task, this basic line will never change. A communist fighter must at all times defend the Party, defend our lofty ideals, defend our socialist cause, and defend our general line. Anyone who tries to find excuses to negate the Party's fundamental line, the more flowery his words are, the more we must use class analysis to see which class he is speaking for. With this firm belief, we will not waver at the first sign of trouble.

    Second, discernment. Discernment means discerning the direction of the wind, paying particular attention to the ideological trends that appear at turning points, and distinguishing between opinions that are sincerely offered to overcome shortcomings and those fallacies that exaggerate shortcomings with ulterior motives. Fallacies can appear in various disguises, and the same fallacy can reappear repeatedly. At this time, the mind must be particularly clear. When some remarks first appear, you may only feel that they are somewhat strange and not quite understand their essence. You must be patient, carefully observe their dynamics, pay attention to their development, and discern them from their development. If you see some people clapping and cheering, and you follow suit without even sniffing, echoing what others say, and blindly joining in anti-proletarian ideas, then you will definitely waver, and even seriously waver without realizing it. When a fallacy develops to a certain extent, it will clearly expose its true colors. The tail of bourgeois ideology cannot be hidden. As long as you discern it clearly, you will definitely be able to discover it.

    Third, resistance. If the reactionary tide has already come to your side, then you must have the courage to fight to defend the Party's policies and lines, and you must have the determination to uphold the truth. Do not avoid it, do not give way, and confront the countercurrent head-on. Either you push back the countercurrent, or you will be knocked down by it or shaken. At this time of testing, your backbone must not be soft, and you must never surrender or make concessions to hostile ideas. It is in the struggle against the countercurrent that you can temper the hard bones of the proletariat.

    Fourth, struggle. When the situation is clear and the time for a comprehensive counterattack has come, we must resolutely engage in the struggle against anti-socialist and anti-Marxist ideologies.

    To do this, we must constantly transform ourselves into thorough communists. The bourgeois ideas in our minds and the bourgeois trends in society will "echo each other." If our worldview is not correct and we still use the bourgeois perspective to view socialist reality, then we will naturally become dizzy and unable to discern, resist, or struggle when the ill wind blows. The proletarian revolution is the most thorough revolution in history, and it will never stop at a certain stage. Anyone who has not firmly established a communist worldview will waver, doubt, and become pessimistic about the revolution when they discover that the development of real life has exceeded the scope of the bourgeois democratic revolution program in their minds, and when the old things and old habits that they are familiar with, fond of, or pursuing are about to disappear forever from history. If they therefore want to take the road back, and try to turn around and block the revolutionary torrent that is surging like a flood, they will be transformed into the opposite of the revolution. This phenomenon seems sudden, but it is actually inevitable. In the mighty advancing ranks, the constant dropping out of a very small number of people, some abandoning their work, some becoming stumbling blocks and being thrown aside, some falling down and being pulled up again by comrades, proves that this is an advancing team, and a team that is advancing resolutely and rapidly. However, the millions of soldiers on the march should learn from the lessons of the waverers, so that their steps will be more steady in the direction set.

    The great decade has become immortal history. Even greater decades, twenty years, thirty years... are waiting for us ahead. The struggle is endless and increasingly profound, and self-transformation is also endless. How can we be a thorough and unwavering communist in the future struggle of breaking the old and establishing the new? It is worth pondering.

　　论动摇
　　姚文元
    从1957年到现在，短短两年多的历史，丰富极了。每一个人都经历了两次阶级斗争的高潮，经历了两次考验。阶级斗争的大风暴真好像一座社会主义的大学校，教育了干部，也教育了几万万劳动人民。
      “前事不忘，后事之师”。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争高一阵低一阵的情况，还将在今后一个长时间内存在，还会继续在不同的问题上以不同的形式出现。斗争的经验教训，值得每一个革命者深思。其中一条最根本的经验，就是在歪风逆流中不要动摇，首先在大问题上不要动摇。不管天上吹起什么风，不管海里扬起什么浪，工作和生活的船只都要毫不动摇地朝着总路线这个罗盘针所指示的方向前进。党中央和毛主席指出的这条航线，是最快、最正确、最顺利的航线，是真理的航线，如果动摇而离开了这个方向，船就要出毛病。小离开出小毛病，大离开出大毛病，九十度大转弯的就会触礁、搁浅以至沉没。
    怎样才能坚定地、毫不动摇地沿着总路线的方向前进呢？每个人都有自己的体会。从思想战线上的斗争来说，我觉得以下一些都是很重要的：
    一曰稳。稳，就是站稳无产阶级立场。不管有什么风吹雨打，这个基本的阶级立场决不动摇。我们的理想是共产主义，我们当前进行的是社会主义革命和社会主义建设，照耀我们前进的灯塔是总路线。在一定的历史时期内，这些都是决不会变动的。不管我们在某一件具体工作上有什么局部的缺点要改正，这个基本的路线是决不会变动的。一个共产主义战士，任何时候都要维护党，维护我们崇高的理想，维护我们的社会主义事业和我们的总路线。凡是想寻找借口来否定党的根本路线的人，他越是说得花巧，我们就越要用阶级分析的方法看一看他是为那一个阶级说话。有了这个坚定的信念，就不会在某个问题上一阵风起，脚跟就摇动了。
    二曰辨。辨，就是辨风向，特别要注意在转折点上出现的思想动态，要辨别真是为了克服缺点而热心地提出的意见和那些夸大缺点别有用心的谬论。谬论会以各种各样的伪装出现，而且同一种谬论还会重复地多次出现。这时刻，头脑要特别清醒。有些言论刚露头的时候，只觉得它有些异样，还摸不清楚它的本质，就要忍耐一下，仔细观察它的动态，注视它的发展，从发展中去辨别它。看到有一些人在拍手叫好，你也不嗅一嗅就随声附和，人云亦云，明明是反无产阶级的思想，你也糊糊涂涂地去凑一脚，这样就一定会动摇，甚而至于已经严重地动摇了自己还不知觉。谬论发展到一定程度就会很清楚地暴露出自己的真相，资产阶级思潮的尾巴决计藏不住的，只要清醒地去辨别它，一定可以发觉。
    三曰顶。如果反动的思潮已经来到你的身旁，那就要有为保卫党的方针路线而斗争的勇气，要有坚持真理的决心，不回避，不让路，硬硬头皮，针锋相对地将逆流顶回去。或者是你把逆流顶回去，或者你就被逆流冲倒或冲得摇摇摆摆。在这种考验的时候，腰杆子千万不能软，决不对敌对思想投降、让步。同逆流的斗争中，才能磨炼出无产阶级的硬骨头。
    四曰斗。当形势已经分明，全面反击的时机已到，就要坚决地投入同反社会主义、反马克思主义思潮的斗争。
    要这样做，就得不断地改造我们自己，成为一个彻底的共产主义者。头脑里的资产阶级思想同社会上的资产阶级思潮是会“里应外合”的，如果我们世界观不对头，还用资产阶级的眼光来看社会主义的现实，那歪风一吹，自然就容易昏头昏脑，辨、顶、斗都谈不到了。无产阶级革命是历史上最彻底的革命，它决不会在某一阶段上停顿起来。凡是没有牢固地树立共产主义世界观的人，当他发现现实生活的发展已经超过他头脑中资产阶级民主革命纲领的范围，他所熟悉、留恋或追求的旧事物、旧习惯即将从历史上永远消失的时候，就会对革命产生动摇、怀疑、悲观。如果因此而想走回头路，想回转身挡一挡洪水般汹涌而来的革命的巨流，就会转化成为革命的对立面。这种现象看似突然其实是必然的。浩浩荡荡前进的队伍中，不断有很少数人掉队，有人撒手不干了，有人变成绊脚石而被摔到一旁去，有人跌倒了又被同志拉起来，正证明了这是一支前进的队伍，并且是一支坚决、迅速前进的队伍。然而千千万万行进中的战士，是应当从动摇分子中吸取教训，使自己的步子更沉着地朝着既定的方向的。
    伟大的十年已经成为不朽的历史了。还有更伟大的十年、二十年、三十年……在前面等着我们。斗争是没有休止，并且越来越深刻的，自我改造也是没有止境的。怎样在今后破旧立新的斗争中做一个彻底的不动摇的共产主义者？值得我们深思。
