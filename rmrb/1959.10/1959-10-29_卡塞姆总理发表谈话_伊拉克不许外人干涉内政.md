    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 28th: Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem told reporters from the "Times" on the evening of the 27th that "Iraq will not launch aggression against anyone, and at the same time will not allow anyone to interfere in our country's internal affairs." He also said, "Our country is neutral."

    When asked by reporters about the issue of foreign troops gathering near the Iraqi border, Kassem replied, "Iraq is prepared to crush any foreign aggression. Iraq will continue to pursue a policy of liberation until we realize the hopes of the Iraqi people and the Arab peoples for freedom and democracy."

    Regarding the assassination plot, he said, "I have heard about it for some time. The plot consists of four links, and it was originally planned to take action on Thursday – the day after the assassination attempt. However, the clues for the fourth link are unclear, and we have not figured out who is involved and the areas of their activities, so we were unable to crush it in advance."

    卡塞姆总理发表谈话
    伊拉克不许外人干涉内政
    新华社巴格达28日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆27日晚上对“时代报”记者说，“伊拉克不对任何人发动侵略，同时不容许任何人干涉我国的内政。”他又说，“我们的国家是中立的”。
    在记者问到外国在伊拉克边境附近集结军队的问题时，卡塞姆回答说，“伊拉克准备粉碎任何外国的侵略。伊拉克将继续奉行解放政策，直到我们实现了伊拉克人民和阿拉伯各国人民争取自由和民主的希望为止”。
    在谈到暗杀阴谋时，他说，“我早有所闻。这个阴谋是由四个环节构成的，本来要在星期四——即行刺事件发生的次日——动手，但是，其中的第四个环节的线索不明，我们没有弄清楚参与的是那些人及其活动的地区，所以未能事先予以粉碎”。
