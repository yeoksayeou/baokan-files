Building a Modern Large-Scale Mine Quickly, Well, and Economically
——New Experience in Rapid Mine Construction at the No. 7 Mine of Pingdingshan Coal Mine, Henan

The No. 7 Mine of Pingdingshan Coal Mine in Henan Province is a modern large-scale mine designed to produce 900,000 tons annually. The coal mined is high-quality coking coal. Construction of this mine began on December 15, 1957, and it was officially put into production on August 20, 1959, taking a total of twenty months. This was sixteen months ahead of the target set by the Ministry of Coal Industry and three months ahead of the design schedule. The total investment was planned to be more than 19.96 million yuan, but the actual cost was only more than 17 million yuan, saving the state more than 2.3 million yuan.

At the initial stage of transfer, the mine's transportation, hoisting, ventilation, drainage, and ground production systems were basically equipped, and the total length of the coal mining working face exceeded the standard stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry. After acceptance and appraisal by the National Acceptance Committee, it was considered that the quality of all projects was qualified, and the vast majority of projects reached the excellent grade.

The high speed and quality of Mine No. 7 were guaranteed by the heroic struggle of all employees under the leadership of the Party and the vigorous support of all parties. It is a victory for the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Resolutely Struggle Against Right-leaning Conservative Thinking

The construction of Mine No. 7 was in the period of socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, and it was also in the period of the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in production. The entire process of mine construction was a process of struggle between the advanced idea of greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the backward right-leaning conservative thinking of less, slower, worse, and more expensive, between leaping forward ideas and conservative ideas. Throughout the mine construction process, the principle of greater, faster, better, and more economical results was resolutely implemented. An irreconcilable struggle was launched against the erroneous idea that "if you want greater and faster, you cannot have better and more economical results; if you want better and more economical results, you cannot have greater and faster," and this principle was applied to the work of construction organization.

In the early stage of mine construction, the progress of shaft excavation and lining was slow. At that time, some comrades said, "Geological conditions are not good, and the speed of mine construction cannot be high"; some comrades complained that "installing temporary scaffolding delayed the time"; and some comrades were satisfied with the existing speed and did not seek progress, and so on. In response to these ideas, the Party committee put forward the slogan of "sweeping away the 'three winds,' overthrowing the 'five airs,' working hard and frugally, and leaping over Da Huangshan" (Xuzhou Da Huangshan Mine). It mobilized the masses to launch a debate, criticized the idea of settling for the middle, mobilized the masses to formulate a Great Leap Forward plan, and launched a socialist labor competition. After that, the progress of the shaft rapidly increased, and a record of 4.6 meters per day appeared, powerfully counterattacking right-leaning conservative thinking.

Last October, the supply of materials and transportation were relatively tight. At this time, some people were frightened by the difficulties. They said, "You can't cook without rice, and you can't build a mine without materials and equipment." However, the vast number of workers at Mine No. 7 did not succumb to these difficulties. After the Party committee explained the difficult situation to the masses, the masses enthusiastically launched a debate, thoroughly criticized the idea of being a "hand-stretcher" and passively waiting, and launched a high tide of mass transportation and saving on the "three materials" (steel, wood, and cement). Under the personal leadership of the leaders, the masses used their spare time to transport materials themselves and tried every means to use substitutes to save raw materials, thereby basically overcoming the difficulty of insufficient materials and ensuring normal construction.

This year is the decisive stage for the transfer of the project. But at first, a few people developed a slackening mentality, thinking that "the Great Leap Forward had been going on for a year in 1958, and now it's time to take a break." Attendance rates dropped, and the progress of the project also declined accordingly. On the basis of organizing workers to study the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party committee launched a vigorous debate. The workers wrote more than 3,000 big-character posters in three days, thoroughly criticizing the right-leaning slackening mood. The masses mustered even greater efforts. As a result, a vigorous and down-to-earth campaign to increase production and practice economy was quickly and widely launched, and the daily progress leaped to more than 40 meters.

Practice has proved that right-leaning conservative thinking is the main obstacle to building mines with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Only by adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and constantly carrying out the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking can the continuous leap forward in construction be guaranteed.

Launch a Mass Movement for Technical Innovation

During the construction of Mine No. 7, the masses were mobilized to work hard and skillfully, and to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, constantly breaking through key construction problems. In the early stage of construction, how to speed up the shaft excavation progress was a key issue. They focused on excavation and lining work, and organized the main shaft team and the auxiliary shaft team to carry out a red flag competition. Teams within the team also launched competitions. In the competition, the workers were very enthusiastic, set up arenas to compete, innovated technology, and actively learned and promoted advanced construction experience. When excavating the topsoil layer, there was no scaffolding. Leading cadres, veteran workers, and engineering and technical personnel worked hard to create triangular leg wooden supports to replace temporary scaffolding, so that the shaft project could proceed according to plan. When the shaft was excavated to the rock layer, it added new difficulties to the excavation and lining progress. The Party committee put forward the call to "vigorously promote the advanced experience of rapid construction and speed up the shaft progress." The workers enthusiastically launched discussions and offered suggestions. According to the opinions of the masses, the Party committee decided to creatively implement the advanced construction method of cross-excavation and lining, changing the original cycle of drilling, blasting, slagging, and drilling into cross-excavation and lining, so that drilling, slagging, and wall building could be carried out simultaneously. Most of the workers supported this measure, but a few right-leaning conservatives opposed it, saying, "Doing so will disrupt the construction procedure. Parallel operation of double-layer hanging platforms is dangerous, and experiments will cause accidents." The enterprise leaders firmly supported the opinions of the majority of the workers and let the masses boldly experiment. As a result, without increasing equipment and with little increase in personnel, the daily progress of the completed shaft increased from 1.33 meters to 1.696 meters, and the excavation efficiency increased by 27.5%; the main shaft created a new record of 47.1 meters of completed shaft per month, so that the main shaft was excavated to the design level two months ahead of schedule, and the auxiliary shaft was excavated one and a half months ahead of schedule. In order to speed up the shaft progress, the workers of other departments also actively took action to join the competition. For example, the electromechanical workers put forward the slogan of "Everything for the wellhead, everything for production," grasped the main link of maintaining the safe operation of water pumps and air compressors, carried out competitions between teams and groups, and created a new record of 155 days of safe operation of the main shaft water pump, ensuring the successful construction of excavation and lining. After the shaft progress was accelerated, the supply of pipe clamps used for mechanical and electrical equipment could not keep up, which affected the construction. Wang Changhai, the leader of the ironworker group, and veteran workers such as Mao De jointly studied and created a pipe clamp tool tire and used a forging machine to press it, changing from manual operation to machine processing, increasing work efficiency by 14 times. When the shaft reached the bottom, the wharf door between the shaft and the station became a key project in the mine construction. On the basis of breaking superstition and liberating thinking, leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and veteran workers jointly studied and broke the routine of building the wall first and then the cap, and changed to using segmented excavation from top to bottom, building the cap first and then the wall, which was both safe and efficient. The task originally planned for 45 days was completed in only 10 days, which not only guaranteed the quality, but also saved an investment of more than 8,400 yuan. The main shaft skip loading chamber also adopted this method, and it was completed in only 29 days, increasing work efficiency by 3 times. In the case of accelerated excavation speed, long transportation distance, and large transportation volume, difficulties arose in the supply of materials and equipment and transportation. In the face of difficulties, should we bravely stand up to face the difficulties and actively find ways to overcome them, or should we fear the difficulties, stand still, and wait passively? The Party committee resolutely adopted the former revolutionary attitude, actively mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and tried every means to overcome the difficulties, setting off a high tide of mass transportation and saving the "three materials". Due to the lack of steel rails, veteran worker Yao Chuandai created wooden rails to replace steel rails, ensuring construction transportation and saving 30 tons of steel. Due to the lack of mine cars and electric chutes, the workers used manual carrying and earth carts. When materials such as pit wood, sand, cement, and stone could not be transported to the site, the Party committee secretary and the director of the engineering department led the masses to use their spare time to transport more than 6,500 tons of materials from more than ten miles away to supply the construction needs. Through this stage of mass movement, the workers put forward more than 12,000 innovation suggestions, of which 11,274 had a significant effect in actual construction. The saving of only the "three materials" amounted to more than 140 tons of steel, more than 590 cubic meters of wood, and 360 tons of cement.

This year, the project is nearing completion, which is also the most intensive stage of construction. The Party committee put forward the fighting slogan of handing over production ahead of schedule. Around this goal, it organized competitor matches to address key issues. In the competition, the masses put forward the slogan of "Real gold is not afraid of fire, heroes are not afraid of difficulties, come to the Leap Forward stage for testing, and resolutely hand over production ahead of schedule." The roadway excavation of the mining working face was the key project at that time. After the leaders put forward the task of 12 meters per day, the new Sixth Team took the initiative to request to break through this key. They reached 11.2 meters on the first day. Through the timely publicity of this deed, the competition movement developed vigorously. The new 15th team created a record of 294.8 meters of single-head coal roadway per month, exceeding the average advanced index of 250 meters stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry. This initiative inspired the masses and aroused the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. The "May Fourth" Youth Commando team caught up and also reached 280.9 meters of coal roadway per month. After a tense battle, production was handed over ahead of schedule. Practice has proved that a mass movement must have a clear direction of struggle in order to enable the movement to continue to move forward by leaps and bounds.

Rely on Veteran Workers and Train New Workers

After the shaft was completed and the station and mining area were laid out, the amount of work increased day by day, and the number of new workers suddenly increased by more than 1,800, accounting for 92% of the total number of workers in the mine. These new workers came from all levels of urban and rural areas, of which the most were of peasant origin, accounting for 81%. Most of them were politically reliable and enthusiastic, but they did not understand coal mine production common sense and operation technology. With the large increase in the number of new workers, the overall technical level of the mine changed greatly, and the average level dropped from 5.5 to less than 2. In the face of this new situation, the Party committee adopted the policy of self-reliance and accelerated the training of technical forces. First of all, workers were given situation education and class education on for whom to work, and the long-term plans for Mine No. 7 and Pingdingshan were explained, so that veteran workers could recognize the glorious responsibility of training communist successors, and new workers could recognize the important role of the coal industry in national construction and the glorious task of the working class. After discussion, everyone's political awareness was raised. Many new workers expressed that they would "resolutely work in the mine for the rest of their lives and take the mine as their home," "work hard to learn technology and learn from master workers," and "be a model in the countryside and a vanguard in the mine." Veteran workers also expressed that "when teaching new workers, they will not be conservative and will teach them everything they know." While strengthening political and ideological education, leading cadres also went to the workers' dormitories to visit and help solve specific problems. The veteran workers' concern for the new workers was also meticulous, and they enthusiastically helped the new workers arrange their lives; when there were not enough work clothes and boots, they let the new workers wear them, and the veteran workers wore the worn ones. The new workers said with emotion, "Being an apprentice before liberation was like entering hell, but being an apprentice now is like going to heaven. I am really sorry for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party if I don't study hard." Secondly, on the basis of improving ideological understanding, the activity of "one master teaching hundreds of apprentices, guaranteeing teaching and learning" was organized, and a mass teaching upsurge was quickly set off, and contracts for guaranteeing teaching and learning were signed.

After half a year of learning and production training, the technical level of the workers has been greatly improved. According to statistics of 645 underground workers in June of this year, 236 first-level workers were promoted to second-level workers, 67 first-level workers were promoted to third-level workers, 314 second-level workers were promoted to third-level workers, and 28 second-level workers were promoted to fourth-level workers. Eight new workers in the mine became captains, and 216 became group leaders. With the improvement of the technical level, production increased linearly. For example, taking January as 100, March was 194.19, and June increased to 274.42.

Rely on the Masses to Strengthen Enterprise Management

Strengthening enterprise management is an important aspect of speeding up construction progress. Especially for basic construction units with modern equipment, strengthening enterprise management is even more important. In the early stage of mine construction, planning management and technical guidance were relatively weak, and the entry inspection and material requisition and return systems in construction management were not sound, resulting in chaos in some aspects. The construction unit lacked plans for material usage, and the material department could not supply according to the plan, resulting in a situation where sometimes there were no materials, which affected the construction. Through the rectification movement, workers were organized to participate in management, and construction plans were discussed regularly. Self-inspection and mutual inspection were carried out on quality and safety. In the case of a shortage of technicians, the captain and group leader managed both the project and the technology and personnel. In addition to participating in planning management, workers also participated in technical design work. For example, workers and technicians jointly studied and changed the underground coal bin from I-beam flat arches to reinforced concrete arches, saving 2.7 tons of I-beams, and changed the originally designed main and auxiliary shaft protection plates to waterproof troughs, saving 1 ton of I-beams and 4 cubic meters of concrete. While absorbing workers to participate in management, the leadership of specialized departments was also strengthened, so that the two were combined and promoted each other. In strengthening the management of specialized institutions, three main tasks were grasped: First, in order to ensure project quality, safety, economy, and speed up project speed, relying on the masses to sum up experience, established and improved the enterprise management system, such as operating procedures, shift handover system, and technical personnel responsibility system. Especially in ensuring project quality, adhering to the principle of "errors must be returned, negligence must be corrected, everyone is responsible, and meticulous," a quality reward and punishment system, an accident investigation system, and a mass quality and safety inspection network were established to ensure that everyone is responsible for guaranteeing quality. Second, the masses were earnestly mobilized to discuss the construction plan, and plans were disclosed, technical disclosures were made, and work surfaces were posted with signs, boards, maps, and charts, so that every worker could grasp the project specifications, quality, and construction requirements, and turn the rules and regulations into the action program of the masses. Third, the construction program was arranged reasonably. In terms of project layout, the construction method of concentrating superior forces to storm the connection project of the vertical shaft and the wind shaft after the vertical shaft bottomed out was adopted, which made it easy to use the vertical shaft to develop the well bottom station and use the wind shaft to develop the mining area, greatly advancing the time for developing the mining area, and also solving the ventilation and transportation problems for opening more work faces.

After the Pingdingshan No. 7 Mine was handed over to production ahead of schedule, under the leadership of the Party committee, the vast number of workers launched a vigorous battle for coal seizure. The output of raw coal increased sharply. On September 10, it exceeded 1,500 tons, and on September 15, it exceeded the 2,000-ton mark. On September 18 and 24, two days of 3,000 tons of daily production were created. The average daily output in September reached 1,646 tons, overfulfilling the state plan. Now, all the workers of the mine are advancing bravely along the road indicated by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, mustering greater revolutionary efforts, striving to create new achievements in production, and providing more and better "food" for the iron and steel industry.

    多快好省地建设现代化大型矿井
    ——河南平顶山煤矿七号矿井创快速建井新经验
    河南省平顶山七号矿井是一对设计年产九十万吨的现代化的大型矿井，所开采的煤炭都是质量优良的炼焦煤。这个矿井从1957年12月15日开工兴建，到1959年8月20日正式投入生产，共用了二十个月的时间，比煤炭工业部提出的指标提前了十六个月，比设计工期提前了三个月。总投资一千九百九十六万多元，实际只用了一千七百多万元，为国家节约资金二百三十多万元。
    在移交初期，这个矿井的运输、提升、通风、排水和地面生产系统都已经基本装备完毕，采煤工作面的总长度超过了煤炭工业部规定的标准。经过国家验收委员会的验收和鉴定，认为全部工程质量都合格，其中绝大多数工程达到了优良等级。
    七号矿井所以保证了高速、优质，是全体职工在党的领导下英勇奋战和各方面大力支援的结果，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利。
  坚决向右倾保守思想斗争
    七号矿井的建设，正处在政治思想战线上社会主义革命的时期，也是处在史无前例的生产大跃进的时期。整个建井的过程，也就是多快好省和少慢差费、跃进的先进思想和落后的右倾保守思想斗争的过程。在建井过程中，始终贯彻了多快好省的方针，向“要多快就不能好省，要好省就不能多快”的错误思想，开展了不调和的斗争，并把这个原则运用到施工组织工作中去。
    在建井初期，井筒掘砌进度较慢，当时有的同志说：“地质条件不好，建井速度高不了”；有的同志埋怨“安装临时井架耽误了时间”；还有的同志则满足已有的速度，不求上进，等等。党委针对这种种思想，提出了“横扫三风，打倒五气，勤俭苦干，跃过大黄山”（徐州大黄山矿）的口号，发动群众展开鸣放辩论，批判了甘居中游的思想，发动群众制定跃进规划，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。这以后，井筒进度迅速上升，出现了日掘四点六米的纪录，有力地反击了右倾保守思想。
    去年10月，材料供应和运输情况比较紧张。这时，一部分人被困难吓倒了，他们说：“没米做不成饭，没材料设备建不成井”。但是，七号井的广大职工并没有在这些困难面前屈服。党委把困难情况向群众作了交代以后，群众热烈展开了辩论，彻底批判了当“伸手派”和消极等待的思想，掀起群众大搞运输和节约三材（钢材、木材、水泥，下同）的高潮。在领导亲自带动下，群众利用业余时间，自搬自运，并且千方百计地采用代用品，节约原材料，从而基本上克服了材料不足的困难，保证了正常施工。
    今年是移交工程的决战阶段。但最初有少数人产生了松劲思想，认为“1958年大跃进了一年，现在该歇歇了”，出勤率下降，工程进度也随着下降了。党委在组织职工学习党的八届六中全会公报的基础上，发动了大鸣大放大辩论，职工群众三天写出三千多张大字报，彻底批判了右倾松劲情绪，群众鼓起了更大干劲，从而，一个轰轰烈烈扎扎实实的增产节约运动就迅速广泛地开展了起来，日进度跃进到四十米以上。
    实践证明：右倾保守思想是多快好省建设矿井的主要障碍。只有坚持政治挂帅，不断向右倾保守思想开展斗争，才能保证施工的不断跃进。
  大搞技术革新的群众运动
    七号矿井在施工中，发动群众大干、巧干，大闹技术革新和技术革命，不断地突破施工关键。在施工初期，如何加快井筒掘进速度是个关键问题，他们就以掘砌工程为重点，组织主井队和副井队开展红旗竞赛。队内班与班也展开了竞赛。在竞赛中职工群众干劲很足，立擂比武，革新技术，并积极学习推广先进施工经验。在表土层掘进时，没有井架，领导干部、老工人、工程技术人员刻苦钻研，创造了三角腿木支架代替临时井架，使井筒工程按计划进行。当井筒掘进到岩石层时，给掘砌进度增加了新的困难，党委就提出“大力推广快速施工的先进经验，加快井筒进度”的号召。职工群众热烈展开鸣放，献策献计。党委根据群众的意见，决定创造性地推行掘砌交叉作业先进施工方法，把原来的打眼——放炮——出渣——打眼的循环单行作业，改为掘砌交叉作业，使打眼、出渣和砌壁等工作同时进行。大多数职工都拥护这一措施，少数右倾保守者反对说：“这样做会打乱施工程序，双层吊盘平行作业有危险，试验不好会出事故。”企业领导坚决支持了大多数职工的意见，让群众大胆试验，结果在不增加设备和少增加人员的条件下，日进成井由一点三三米提高到一点六九六米，掘进效率提高27.5％；在主井创造了月进成井四七点一米的新纪录，使主井提前二个月，副井提前一个半月掘进到设计水平。为了加快井筒进度，其他部门的职工也都积极行动起来投入竞赛。如机电工提出“一切工作为了井口，一切活动为了生产”的行动口号，抓住维护水泵压风机安全运转这一主要环节，开展班与班、组与组的竞赛，创造了主井水泵安全运转一百五十五天的新纪录，保证了掘砌的胜利施工。在井筒进度加快以后，机电设备上用的管卡子供应不上，影响施工，铁工组组长王长海和毛德等老工人共同研究，创造了管卡子工具胎和用锻钎机压，由手工操作改为机器加工，提高工效十四倍。当井筒到底以后，井筒与车场之间的码头门就成为矿井施工中的一项关键性工程。群众在破除迷信、解放思想的基础上，领导干部和工程技术人员、老工人共同研究，打破了先砌墙后砌帽的常规，改用了由上而下分段掘进，先砌帽后砌墙的方法，既安全，效率又高，原计划四十五天的任务，仅十天就完成了，不仅保证了质量，而且节约投资八千四百多元。主井箕斗装载峒室也采取这个方法，仅用二十九天就完工了，提高工效三倍。在掘进速度加快、运距长、运量大的情况下，发生了材料设备供应不足和运输紧张的困难。在困难面前是勇敢地站出来正视困难，积极想办法战胜困难呢？还是畏惧困难、裹足不前、消极等待呢？党委坚决地采取了前一种革命者的态度，积极发动群众，依靠群众，千方百计地克服困难，掀起了一个群众大搞运输和节约三材的高潮。钢轨缺乏，老工人姚传岱创造木轨代替钢轨，保证了施工运输，节约钢材三十吨。矿车、电溜子不足，职工群众就用人工挑，土车拉。当坑木、沙子、水泥、料石等材料运不到现场，党委书记、工程处长就带领群众利用业余时间，到十里以外，运回材料六千五百多吨，供应施工需要。通过这一阶段的群众运动，职工群众共提出革新建议一万二千多条，其中有一万一千二百七十四件在实际施工中发生了重大效果，仅三材一项，就节约钢材一百四十多吨，木材五百九十多立方米，水泥三百六十吨。
    今年，工程接近竣工，也是施工最紧张的阶段，党委提出了提前移交生产的战斗号召，围绕这个目标，针对关键问题，组织了对手赛。在竞赛中群众提出：“真金不怕火炼，英雄不怕困难，跃进台前来考验，坚决提前交生产”的行动口号。回采工作面的巷道掘进是当时的关键工程，领导提出日进十二米的任务以后，新六队主动要求突破这个关键，他们第一天就达到十一点二米。通过对这一事迹的及时宣传，竞赛运动就蓬勃地开展了起来。新十五队创独头煤巷月进二百九十四点八米的纪录，超过了煤炭工业部规定的二百五十米的平均先进指标，这一创举鼓舞了群众，激起了广大职工群众学先进、赶先进的热潮。“五四”青年突击队奋起直追，也达到了煤巷月进二百八十点九米。经过紧张的战斗，提前移交了生产。实践证明：大搞群众运动必须有明确的奋斗方向，才能使运动不断地大踏步地向前发展。
  依靠老工人，培养新工人
    当井筒建成，车场和采区铺开以后，工程量日益增大，新工人陡然增加了一千八百多人，占全矿工人总数的92％。这些新工人来自城乡各个阶层，其中农民出身的最多，占81％。他们大多数是政治可靠、积极肯干，但不懂煤矿生产常识和操作技术。全矿技术水平随着新工人大量增加，起了很大变化，平均等级由五点五级下降到不足二级。在这种新的形势面前，党委采取了自力更生、加速培养技术力量的方针。首先向工人进行形势教育和为谁劳动的阶级教育，讲解了七号井和平顶山的远景规划，使老工人认识到培养共产主义接班人的光荣责任，新工人认识到煤炭工业在国家建设中的重大作用和工人阶级的光荣任务。经过辩论，提高了大家的政治觉悟，许多新工人纷纷表示“坚决在矿上干一辈子，以矿为家”，“努力学习技术，向老师傅看齐”，“在农村当模范，在矿山当尖兵”；老工人也表示“在教新工人时，不保守，有啥教啥”。在加强政治思想教育的同时，领导干部还深入工人宿舍访问，帮助解决具体问题。老工人对新工人的关怀也是无微不至的，热诚帮助新工人安排生活；当工作服、靴子不够时，让给新工人穿，老工人穿破的。新工人感动地说：“解放前当学徒像入地狱，现在当学徒如上天堂，再不努力学习实在对不起毛主席和共产党”。其次，在提高思想认识的基础上，组织“一师带百徒、包教保学”活动，迅速掀起了一个群众性的教学热潮，签订了包教保学合同。
    经过半年来的学习和生产锻炼，工人的技术水平有了很大提高。据今年6月井下六百四十五名工人统计，一级工升为二级工的二百三十六人，一级工提为三级工的六十七人，二级工提为三级工的三百一十四人，二级工提为四级工的二十八人。全矿新工人当队长的八人，当组长的二百一十六人。随着技术水平的提高，生产直线上升。如以1月份为一百，3月为一百九十四点一九，6月提高到二百七十四点四二。
  依靠群众加强企业管理
    加强企业管理是加快施工进度的一个重要方面。特别是现代化设备的基本建设单位，加强企业管理就更为重要。在建井初期，计划管理和技术指导比较薄弱，施工管理上的入井检查、材料领退等制度不健全，以致在某些方面发生混乱。施工单位用料缺乏计划，材料部门无法按计划供应，形成有时没材料，影响施工。通过整风运动，组织工人参加管理，定期讨论施工计划，对质量、安全进行了自查互查，在技术员缺少的情况下，队长、组长既管工程，又管技术和人事。工人除参加计划管理以外，还参加技术设计工作。如工人和技术员共同研究，把井下煤仓由工字钢平拱改为钢筋混凝土拱顶，节约工字钢二点七吨，把原设计的主副井防护板改为防水槽，节约工字钢一吨和混凝土四立方米。在吸收工人参加管理的同时，还加强了科室专职机构的领导，使两者互相结合，互相推动。在加强专职机构管理方面，主要抓了三项工作：第一，为了保证工程质量、安全、节约，加快工程速度，依靠群众总结经验，建立并健全了企业管理制度，如作业规程、交接班制以及技术人员责任制等。特别是在保证工程质量方面，本着“有错必返，忽视必纠，人人负责，一丝不苟”的原则，建立了质量奖惩制度、事故追查制度和群众性的质量安全检查网等，作到人人负责保证质量合格。第二，认真发动群众讨论施工计划，采取了计划交底、技术交底，工作面挂牌板图表，使每个工人掌握工程规格质量和施工要求，把规章制度变成群众的行动纲领。第三，合理安排施工程序。在工程布局方面，采取在竖井井筒到底以后，集中优势力量突击竖井和风井的贯通工程的施工方法，这样就便于用竖井开拓井底车场和用风井开拓采区，大大提前了开拓采区的时间，同时也为多开工作面解决了通风和运输问题。
    平顶山七号矿井提前移交生产以后，广大职工在党委的领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的夺煤大战，原煤产量猛增，9月10日突破了一千五百吨，15日突破了两千吨大关，18日和24日两天创造了日产三千吨的纪录。9月份的平均日产达到一千六百四十六吨，超额完成了国家计划。现在，全矿职工正沿着党的八届八中全会所指示的道路，鼓足更大的革命干劲，力争在生产上创造更新的成就，为钢铁工业提供更多更好的“食粮”而奋勇前进。（附图片）
