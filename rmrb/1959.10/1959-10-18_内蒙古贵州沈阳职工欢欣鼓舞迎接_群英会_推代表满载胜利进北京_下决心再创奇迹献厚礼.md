During the conference, the conference also received a large number of letters and telegrams from employees of all ethnic groups in the region, expressing their response to the call of the conference and striving to complete this year's production and construction tasks ahead of schedule and above quota.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 17th – The Guizhou Province representatives to attend the National "Heroes' Assembly" have been recently selected, with a total of 119 official representatives and 16 specially invited representatives. They are all representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers in Guizhou Province in the fields of industrial production, basic construction, transportation, finance and trade, and culture, education, and health. Among them are heroes from the cold mountainous areas of Shuicheng and Hezhang in northwestern Guizhou, and good men from Jinping and Liping in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture; there are old models who have maintained the glorious title of advanced producers for years, and new experts who have not participated in construction for long.

The representatives who are particularly admired are the pacesetters who have emerged on the fronts of machinery, construction, transportation, post and telecommunications, and light industry. Zhang Jun, a carpenter and Communist Party member of the Guizhou Automobile Parts Factory, under the education of the Party and the help of his comrades, has been engaged in creation and innovation for ten years as one day. He has created seventeen machines successively. In March this year, he finally realized the mechanized production of the woodworking workshop he was in. Since 1954, he has been selected as an advanced producer in the province and city every year, a provincial industrial labor model, and a second-class national highway transportation model, becoming a famous technical revolution pacesetter in Guizhou. In order to better serve the construction of the motherland, in September this year, Zhang Jun began to learn lathe technology and develop into an all-rounder. In just eighteen days, he realized six innovations and took the initiative to help the Red Flag Eighth Class rush to make molds, mechanizing manual operations and increasing efficiency by 310 times.

Liu Yinzong, the carpentry captain and Communist Party member of the Guizhou Provincial Construction Fourth Company, has made innovations every quarter and creations every year in the six years from 1953 to 1959. In just over a year from last year to October this year, he created 105 tools, put forward 363 suggestions, and realized 177 items, solving many key problems in production, and saving more than 25,000 working days a year.

The Third Team of the Second Vehicle Team of the Guizhou Transportation Company is an advanced collective that will attend the National "Heroes' Assembly" and is one of the pacesetters in the Guizhou transportation system. The team has 124 employees and 70 vehicles. When the team was established in 1954, in addition to 14 veteran drivers, the rest were novices who had just graduated from the driving training class. Because they pooled their efforts, helped each other, and encouraged each other, they not only overfulfilled their transportation tasks every year, but also created the miracle of an average of 340,000 kilometers without major repairs on the rugged highways of the Guizhou Plateau, and won the provincial safety medal and certificate many times.

Guan Wanzhen, a young female worker and Communist Party member in the printing workshop of the Guiyang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a pacesetter in the light industry system of Guiyang City, is a Wu Lianghu-style hero who has always stood at the forefront of production and various central movements for eight years, and has creatively and excellently completed the tasks assigned to her by the Party every month. In particular, in her work, she has successively helped eight workshops and forty-seven people in the workshop she was in to reach the advanced level, of which sixteen have become advanced producers.

Among the representatives are Wang Shuqin, a telephone operator from the Guiyang City Post and Telecommunications Bureau and a member of the Communist Youth League, Shi Jianyuan, a Guizhou provincial safe driving pacesetter who has driven safely for 410,000 kilometers and completed this year's plan four and a half months ahead of schedule, and Li Benfu, a model purchaser known as the "living dictionary of local products and medicinal materials."

These representatives of advanced collectives and advanced figures who have emerged on various fronts of industry, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade in Guizhou will soon go to the capital with the intentions of tens of millions of employees in Guizhou and the determination to complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule and above quota to participate in the National Heroes' Assembly on October 25 and report to the Party and Chairman Mao their work and the great achievements that the people of Guizhou have already made.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th – Shenyang City held a representative conference of labor models and advanced producers on the afternoon of the 16th. More than 1,700 representatives passed a proposal at the meeting, advocating that all employees in the city create new achievements and offer gifts to the National Heroes' Assembly, guaranteeing to complete the annual national plan twenty days ahead of schedule, and at the same time prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward in the first quarter of next year.

The proposal put forward that while deepening various forms of production increase and economy practice competitions, we should enthusiastically respond to the call of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shenyang Municipal Committee, learn from the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performance competition, and immediately launch a vigorous technical performance competition upsurge in all industrial, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, and other enterprises in the city, so as to achieve factory performance, performance everywhere, class performance, everyone performance, everything performance, and comprehensively and rapidly improve technical level and break through production quotas, so that production is higher day by day and higher month by month.

The proposal also put forward that we should widely and deeply carry out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and vigorously carry out the "matching" of advanced experiences. Every employee should match the experiences they have used in the past according to their own work requirements, and comprehensively promote various advanced experiences. At the same time, we must widely and deeply launch an upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. We must widely promote the experience of the "Advanced Producer Service Team" in various units in the city, organize advanced producers, organize and plan to promote advanced experiences and drive those who are temporarily backward to catch up with the advanced.

The conference elected 133 representatives to attend the National Advanced Collective and Advanced Producer Representative Conference for Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade. They are all banners and vanguards who have emerged in the Great Leap Forward. Among them are Wang Longen, an engineer from Shenyang Transformer Factory, who successfully researched and developed 18 major technological innovations in the Great Leap Forward and helped surrounding comrades realize 70 innovation projects. There is the famous labor model Hu Jiazhu, who created 150,000 yuan of wealth for the country in one year during last year's Great Leap Forward. There is the young grinder Kong Qingtang, whose production tasks completed by one person in the first half of this year are equivalent to the workload of ten people.

　　内蒙古贵州沈阳职工欢欣鼓舞迎接“群英会”
    推代表满载胜利进北京  下决心再创奇迹献厚礼
    新华社呼和浩特17日电　为时六天的内蒙古先进集体和先进生产者代表大会昨天闭幕。参加这次大会的有来自自治区工业生产、交通运输、基本建设和财贸等方面的蒙古、汉、回、满、达斡尔、鄂伦春、鄂温克等民族代表共九百多名。
    代表们在会上以昂扬的斗志，一致响应内蒙古党委的号召，保证深入反右倾、鼓干劲，大干八十天，大大提前和超额完成今年各项生产和建设任务，为明年的大跃进创造有利条件。
    大会向自治区全体职工提出：要求提前一个月完成全年工业产值计划，保证完成和超额完成全年钢、钢材、生铁、原煤、木材等的生产任务；提前一个半月，完成全年基本建设施工任务；提前二十天到四十天，完成铁路、公路、内河航运的全年运输计划；农牧业生产、财贸和其他方面的任务，也都要求提前和超额完成。并且强调指出，这是摆在全自治区工人阶级和各族人民面前的光荣而艰巨的任务；实现了这些任务，自治区就可以把原订的第二个五年计划的主要指标大大提高，使自治区的社会主义建设继续保持高速度的发展。
    为此，大会号召全区先进生产者和全体职工继续把右倾思想反透，把干劲鼓足，把总路线的红旗高高举起，乘胜前进。要进一步破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革命和技术革新，更多更好地增加产量，提高质量，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，把增产节约运动高潮更加深入地、持续不断地发展下去。全体先进生产者要带头学习和宣传总路线和党的八届八中全会的决议，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和文化技术水平，进一步发挥“骨干、带头、桥梁”作用，在全体职工中掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛高潮。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记、自治区主席乌兰夫向大会致祝词，自治区副主席哈丰阿致开幕词，自治区副主席王逸伦向大会作了关于“反右倾、鼓干劲，大干第四季度，为实现1959年大跃进而奋斗”的报告。各族先进生产者代表还听了内蒙古自治区总工会副主席蒋毅的报告，交流和总结了各项生产建设战线上的经验，并且选出了一百三十九名出席全国“群英大会”的代表。
    会议期间，大会还收到了全区各民族职工的大批函电，纷纷表示响应大会号召，为提前和超额完成今年的各项生产建设任务而奋斗。
    据新华社贵阳17日电　出席全国“群英大会”的贵州省代表已在最近评选完毕，共计选出正式代表一百一十九人，特邀代表十六人。他们都是贵州省工业生产、基本建设、交通运输、财贸系统和文教卫生等方面的先进集体代表和先进生产者。其中有黔西北高寒山区水城、赫章的英雄，有黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏、黎平的好汉；有历年保持先进生产者光荣称号的老模范，也有参加建设事业不久的新能手。
    代表中特别受到人们敬仰的是机械、建筑、交通、邮电、轻工业等战线上涌现出来的标兵。贵州汽车配件厂木工、共产党员张俊，在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，十年如一日地搞创造、闹革新，先后创制出十七部机器，在今年3月终于使他所在的木工车间全部实现了机械化的生产。从1954年起，他逐年都被评选为省、市先进生产者，省工业劳动模范，全国公路运输二等模范，成为贵州著名的技术革命标兵。为了能更好地为祖国建设服务，今年9月，张俊又开始学习车工技术，向多面手发展。在短短的十八天里，他就实现了六项革新，并且主动帮助红旗八班车冲模具，使手工操作机械化，提高工效三百一十倍。
    贵州省建筑四公司的木工队长、共产党员刘银宗，从1953年到1959年的六年中，季季有革新、年年有创造。仅去年到今年10月一年多的时间里，他就创制了工具一百零五件，提出建议三百六十三项，实现一百七十七项，解决了生产中很多关键问题，一年能节省二万五千多个劳动日。
    贵州运输公司汽车二场第三队是将出席全国“群英大会”的先进集体，是贵州交通系统标兵之一，全队有职工一百二十四人，七十辆车。1954年车队成立的时候，除了十四个老驾驶员以外，其余都是刚从驾驶训练班毕业的新手。由于他们群策群力，互助互勉，几年来不仅年年超额完成运输任务，并且在贵州高原崎岖的公路上创造了平均三十四万公里无大修的奇迹，好几次荣获省的安全奖章、奖状等。
    贵阳市轻工业系统的标兵、贵阳染织厂印花车间青年女工、共产党员管万珍，是吴良湖式的英雄，八年来始终站在生产和各项中心运动的最前列，创造性地月月出色完成党交给她的任务。特别是她在劳动中，曾先后帮助所在车间八个工段和四十七人达到了先进水平，其中有十六人已成为先进生产者。

    在贵州工业交通、基本建设、财贸等各个战线上涌现出来的这些先进集体和先进人物的代表，即将带着贵州千万职工的心意和保证提前超额完成今年国家计划的决心到首都去，参加10月25日全国群英盛会，向党和毛主席汇报自己的工作和贵州人民已经取得的巨大成就。

    倡议书提出要在深入开展各种形式的增产节约竞赛的同时，热烈响应中共辽宁省委和沈阳市委的号召，学习鞍钢技术表演赛的经验，立即在全市所有工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸等企业掀起一个轰轰烈烈的技术表演赛高潮，达到厂厂表演、处处表演、班班表演、人人表演、事事表演、全面迅速提高技术水平和突破生产定额，使生产一天比一天高，一月比一月高。
    倡议书还提出要广泛深入地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞先进经验“配套”。每个职工都按照自己的工作要求，把过去运用过的经验搭配成套，全面地推广各种先进经验。同时要深入广泛地掀起学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮，要在全市各单位广泛推广“先进生产者服务队”的经验，把先进生产者组织起来，有组织有计划地推广先进经验和带动暂时落后的人赶上先进。
    这次会议选出了一百三十三名出席全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会的代表。他们都是在大跃进中涌现出来的旗帜和尖兵。其中有沈阳变压器厂工人出身的工程师王龙恩，他在大跃进中研究成功十八项重大技术革新，并且帮助周围同志实现了七十件革新项目。有著名劳动模范胡加柱，他在去年大跃进中一年就为国家创造十五万元财富。有青年磨工孔庆堂，他今年上半年一个人完成的生产任务，相当于十个人的工作量。
