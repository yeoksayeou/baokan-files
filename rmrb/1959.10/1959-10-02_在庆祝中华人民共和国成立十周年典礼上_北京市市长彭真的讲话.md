Let us unite more closely, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the glorious illumination of the general line for socialist construction, redouble our efforts, strive for the upper reaches, and build our country into a great socialist power with greater, faster, better, and more economical results! Let us unite more closely with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, unite with the working people of the world, and unite with all peace-loving countries and people of the world to work together for the lofty cause of maintaining peace and striving for human progress!
