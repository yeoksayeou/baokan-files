    Diagram of the Soviet Union's Three Cosmic Rocket Launches Illustrated by Yi Shitong
    When the first cosmic rocket was launched, the Earth was at perihelion (when the Earth's speed is fastest). The Moon was ahead in the direction of the Earth's movement, and the rocket was also launched in the direction of the Earth's movement, becoming the first artificial planet. It passed through its aphelion (slowest) in early September and is currently in the position shown in the diagram.

    The launch position for the second cosmic rocket was chosen because launching the rocket on that day resulted in the smallest angle between the rocket's trajectory and the Earth's surface, minimizing the loss of speed due to Earth's gravity, and ensuring the largest effective payload was sent to the Moon. The second cosmic rocket reached the Moon's surface on April 14th (Beijing time 5:02:24 AM).

    When the third cosmic rocket reached the Moon's region, the Moon had just reached near its perigee. The direction of the rocket's movement was generally towards the Sun (which is the opposite of the second cosmic rocket).

    Currently, the automatic interplanetary station carried by the rocket has separated from the final stage rocket and is operating in the designated orbit (the rocket is also traveling along an orbit very close to that of the automatic interplanetary station).

    苏联三个宇宙火箭发射情况图  伊世同绘
    第一个宇宙火箭发射时，地球正处于近日点（那时地球的速度最快）。月球在地球前进方向的前面，火箭也是按地球的前进方向发射的。成为第一个人造行星。九月初通过其轨道上的远日点（最慢），目前正在图中所示位置上。
    第二个宇宙火箭发射所选的位置是因为：在那一天发射火箭，火箭飞行时对地球表面的角度最小，使速度由于地心引力而遭到损失达到最小程度，并保证把最大的有效重物送上月球。第二个宇宙火箭于四月十四日（北京时间五时零二分二十四秒）到达月球表面。
    第三个宇宙火箭到达月球区域时，月球刚好走到近地点附近，火箭前进的方向大体上是向着太阳（这一点恰和第二个宇宙火箭相反）。
    目前火箭上所载的自动行星际站已和最后一级火箭脱离，按照指定的轨道运转（火箭也沿着和自动行星际站极其相近的轨道前进）。
