　　Cuba Will Never Retreat!
　　United States Issues Note Coercing Cuba to Stop Land Reform
　　Castro Says He Will Never Give Up the Struggle for Economic Liberation
　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th - Cuban Prime Minister Castro said on television last night, in response to the U.S. note threatening Cuba over the land reform issue, that "we will never give up the struggle for Cuba's economic liberation at any time." The U.S. threat is that if Cuba does not stop carrying out land reform or does not compensate the U.S. sugar owners in advance with cash at the highest price stipulated by the land law for the expropriated land, the U.S. will reduce Cuba's sugar sales quota in the U.S. market.
　　Castro stated: "If (the U.S.) actually takes measures to oppose us, we will take countermeasures as required by the situation. We are defending our people, and we will never retreat."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th - According to news prominently published in today's newspapers, the U.S. government has delivered a note to the Cuban government threatening that if Cuba does not stop land reform, it will reduce the share of Cuban sugar exports to the U.S. market.
　　"Hoy" newspaper said in its commentary on the U.S. note that the U.S. note protested the Cuban government's "expropriation of sugarcane plantations belonging to the United States under the provisions of the land reform law," which is an attempt to force the Cuban government to compensate for the confiscated U.S. property at the highest value stipulated by law and to pay in advance.
　　"Hoy" revealed that the U.S. government, in order to achieve this goal, has employed "cunning" conspiratorial tactics: it instigated Mexico and other Latin American sugar exporting countries to compete for a larger share in the U.S. market than Cuba, and U.S. news agencies also publicized that Cuba's share was "too large," while the shares of Mexico and other countries were "very small."
　　"Hoy" newspaper's economic editor, Jacinto Torras, pointed out that the demand to pay U.S. enterprises in cash in advance is unacceptable because Cuba needs to use this money for essential needs to develop its economy. He pointed out that when subservience to the tyranny of foreign capital ruled Cuba, the U.S. considered it Cuba's "friend," but when the entire Cuban people put forward their legitimate aspirations, demanding that Cuba become a free and sovereign nation, the U.S. implemented a policy of "aggression."

　　古巴决不后退！
　　美国提出照会胁迫古巴停止土改
    卡斯特罗表示决不放弃争取经济解放的斗争
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗昨晚在电视里回答美国就土地改革问题威胁古巴的照会时说，“我们任何时候都决不放弃争取古巴经济解放的斗争。”美国的威胁是：如果古巴不停止进行土地改革或者不向美国糖业主预先按土地法所规定的最高价格以现金偿付被征用的土地的话，美国就要降低古巴糖在美国市场上的销售定额。
    卡斯特罗表示：“如果（美国）竟然采取措施来反对我们，我们就将采取形势所要求的反措施。我们正在保卫我国人民，我们决不后退。”
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　据各报今天以显著地位登载的消息说，美国政府交给了古巴政府一份照会，照会威胁说，假如古巴不停止土地改革，就减少古巴蔗糖向美国市场的出口份额。
    “今日报”在评论美国的照会时说，美国的照会抗议古巴政府“根据土地改革法的规定征收属于美国的甘蔗种植园”，这是企图使古巴政府按照法律规定的最高价值对被没收的美国产业给予赔偿，并且要先期付款。
    “今日报”揭露说，美国政府为了达到这个目的，施展了“狡猾的”阴谋手段：它嗾使墨西哥和拉丁美洲其他蔗糖输出国在美国市场上争得比古巴大的份额，美国通讯社还宣传说，古巴的份额“太大”，而墨西哥和其他国家的份额“非常小”。
    “今日报”经济编辑哈辛托·托拉斯指出，事先付给美国企业现款的要求是不可接受的，因为古巴需要把这些钱用在发展经济必不可少的需要上。他指出，当屈从于外国资本的暴政统治着古巴时，美国认为它是古巴的“朋友”，而当古巴全国人民提出自己的正当愿望，要求古巴成为自由主权的国家时，美国就执行“侵略政策”。
