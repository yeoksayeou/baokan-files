    People's Commune Locks the Dragon
    CPC Shandong Linyi Prefectural Committee
    Editor's Note: The Linyi area of Shandong Province, mainly relying on its own efforts and supplemented by state support, built six large reservoirs in one year. This is a remarkable achievement and a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, a victory for the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune.
    However, in some places, "reaching out" factions and "difficulty" theorists have emerged in water conservancy construction. The "reaching out" faction asks the state for everything: funds, materials, and technicians. The "difficulty" theorists believe that nothing can be done without experts, no reservoirs can be built without state-supplied steel and cement, construction is difficult without state-supplied tools, and no progress can be made without sufficient investment. Both the "reaching out" faction and the "difficulty" theorists are looking upwards, staring at the sky, and cannot see the people. The comrades in the Linyi area are the opposite of them; they see the power of the people and see that the people are the creators of history. It is by relying on the people that they have victoriously completed the construction of the six major reservoirs.
    This is a very good article. As the winter water conservancy movement is about to be fully launched, this article is especially worth reading carefully. The People's Commune overcomes nature, wields spears to split mountains and change rivers, the millennium dragon is now locked, and all the people are happy. The man-made lake is as vast as the sea, and the blue waves connect to the sky. The precious water flows into the reservoir and smiles into the fields. Wheat waves roll and rice is fragrant, ducks and geese flock and fish fill the river. Poor mountains have become a land of fish and rice, and the Communist Party's kindness cannot be fully expressed.
    This is a hymn from the people of the Linyi area to the beautiful picture of the six vast artificial lakes that are unfolding before them.
    On the basis of extensively carrying out mountain and river management and initially changing the face of nature, the Linyi area, holding high the red flag of the general line and relying on the powerful strength of the People's Commune, began to build six large reservoirs with an average storage capacity of over 200 million cubic meters, including Xujiaya, Rizhao, Xiaoshiyang, Doushan, Tangcun, and Huibaoling, while rushing to harvest autumn crops, planting autumn crops, and vigorously developing steel production last autumn. After less than a year of hard work, five of them have been successfully completed, and the Huibaoling Reservoir is also about to be completed. These are the first large-scale reservoir projects in the Linyi area. The six major reservoirs have a total of 10.34 million cubic meters of earth, stone, and sand, and the total length of the dams is 15 li (7.5 km), which can control a drainage area of 2,707 square kilometers. Because they have cut off the six major rivers of Wenliang River, Jun River, Xun River, Yuangong River, West Jia River, and Fuding River, the torrential floods during the flood season have to bow their heads in front of the towering dams. Since then, the history of these rivers harming the people has ended, making 500,000 mu of riverbed beaches into fertile fields, and 900,000 people are freed from floods. The six major reservoirs store 1.4 billion cubic meters of water (about 21% of the total runoff in a normal rainy year), which can irrigate more than 2.9 million mu of farmland and build more than 40 large and small power stations, with an annual power generation of more than 22.7 million kilowatt-hours. It can also develop diversified economies, such as fish farming, duck raising, and goose raising, and use the shallow water on the edge of the reservoir to grow aquatic plants such as lotus roots, cattails, and water chestnuts, with an annual value of tens of millions of yuan. At the same time, it can also vigorously develop power processing and transportation. Various trees and flowers can also be planted around the reservoir in large quantities to increase income and beautify the environment. The broad masses of people are all filled with incomparable joy from the bottom of their hearts at the beautiful prospects of the six major reservoirs that are unfolding before them. Water flows to where it brings happiness. Some elderly women heard that the reservoir was releasing water and stayed up all night waiting for the water to arrive. Although the water storage this year is not yet large, it has initially played its role in fighting drought and protecting autumn harvests.

        Relying on People's Communes
  Pushing Water Conservancy Construction to a New Stage
    The completion of these six major reservoirs marks the glorious victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communization. What agricultural cooperatives could not do in the past is now done by the People's Commune.
    Since liberation, the heroic people of the Linyi area, under the correct leadership of the Party, have relied on organized strength to continuously march towards nature and vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work, thereby initially changing the natural face of poor mountains and bad waters. However, due to the small scale and large limitations of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, they are unable to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy projects. During the period of mutual aid groups, due to the weak strength, they could only gate mountain gullies, repair ponds and dams, and build small reservoirs of several hundred cubic meters. After cooperation, the strength was greater, and the contradictions that mutual aid organizations could not solve were resolved, but they were still limited by various factors and could only build reservoirs of several thousand, tens of thousands, or at most hundreds of thousands of cubic meters. From 1954 to 1958, before the people's communization, a total of 4,317 small and medium-sized reservoirs were built in the process of more than five years, with a storage capacity of more than 280 million cubic meters, averaging only 67,000 cubic meters per reservoir. Among them, the Junan Huyuan Reservoir, with a storage capacity of more than 35 million cubic meters, was built by the state. The People's Commune is different as soon as it appears. Because of its large scale and wide range of activities, it is more suitable for the development of productive forces. Although it is the rising sun, it quickly showed its powerful power and pushed water conservancy construction to a new stage - building large reservoirs that advanced agricultural cooperatives could hardly build. The water storage capacity of the six major reservoirs built this year exceeds five times the total water storage capacity of the reservoirs built in the previous five years. This should be said to be a miracle!
    The superiority of the People's Commune is first manifested in the full mobilization and rational use of labor, which is more superior than advanced agricultural cooperatives. The commune has a large population and strong forces, which can be uniformly arranged and comprehensively taken care of. Under the slogan of "water conservancy construction and agricultural production promoting each other," each commune organized water conservancy battalions and water conservancy companies. At the same time, it reorganized the teams participating in agricultural production. Therefore, after the large army participating in the construction of the reservoir was transferred away, agricultural production was not affected, and it was better this year than in any previous year. Taking Rizhao County as an example, as many as 20,000 laborers in the county were invested in the construction of reservoirs, and wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Although autumn crops suffered from a severe disaster of more than 40 days without rain, except for a small portion of early rice that was slightly less than last year, other crops were much better than the bumper harvest of 1958. It is estimated that the annual output will still exceed last year by about 10%. In order to improve the labor enthusiasm of the migrant workers on the construction site and realize the desire to complete the reservoir as soon as possible, the members of the commune at home recorded labor points as usual for the members participating in water conservancy construction, and also helped to grow private vegetable gardens and solve some special difficulties in family life. This fully demonstrates the new spiritual outlook of people after the people's communization. At the same time, the establishment of welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens liberated a large number of female laborers and played a great role in agricultural production. Because each county and commune had its own factory, they set up repair factories or repair groups on the reservoir construction site, repairing them as they were destroyed, which played an important role in solving reservoir tools and improving work efficiency.
    Building large reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters is a complex project that requires a lot of funds and materials, which advanced agricultural cooperatives were unable to solve at all in the past. The People's Commune, due to its unified leadership and solid material foundation, is easy to solve. These six major reservoirs, in addition to the labor being provided by the masses themselves, also brought their own rations, and the state only subsidized a small portion of wages. The total investment in the six major reservoirs was 52.0688 million yuan, of which 42.4788 million yuan was solved by the communes and the masses, accounting for 81.5% of the total investment, while the state investment only accounted for 18.5% of the total investment that should have been invested. For the rest, like the important equipment necessary for the reservoir, such as steel, wood, cement, and explosives, more than 70% were solved by the communes and the masses. All of this fully proves that the six major reservoirs were not contracted by the state, but were built by the county under unified leadership and command, relying on the powerful strength of the People's Commune, plus the necessary support from the state. Without the people's communization, it would be unimaginable to build such a large reservoir.
    The People's Commune not only provided strong human and material conditions for the reservoir, but more importantly, it improved people's ideological awareness and cultivated people's communist spirit. The 150,000-strong army from 110 communes in nine counties on the construction site fully demonstrated the noble communist spirit. They not only cooperated and supported each other within their own county and commune, but also set off a great cooperation and great support of friendship between counties. The Xujiaya Reservoir in Feixian County is the largest of the six reservoirs. In order to complete the project before the flood season, Rizhao, Linyi, and Tancheng counties volunteered to support 11,000 people and brought their own tools. Their slogan is: "Revolutionary friendship is as deep as the sea, the people of four counties are of one mind, volunteer to help brother counties, eradicate water disasters and eliminate the root of disaster, build a large reservoir as soon as possible, and all the people will enjoy a happy spring." Tancheng, Cangshan, Juxian, and Junan counties also transferred 38 tractors and more than 70 tractor drivers. Linyi, Tancheng, and Rizhao counties transferred 1,900 rubber-wheeled vehicles to support this reservoir. Due to this communist selfless spirit, the progress of the project was greatly accelerated. Facts eloquently prove that this noble communist great cooperation is indispensable in socialist construction and communist construction. Only by earnestly promoting this spirit can we make our great construction cause more, faster, better, and more economical. Of course, this communist great cooperation must be carried out in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, and it must be organized and planned. A total of 195,600 mu of land was occupied for the construction of these six reservoirs, and a total of 114 villages, more than 12,150 households, and more than 48,300 people were relocated. Such a large amount of land occupation and village relocation would have been difficult to solve before the communization. However, after the communization, not only were the material conditions abundant, but also because people's communist style improved, they were able to consciously and happily subordinate individual interests to collective interests and current interests to long-term interests. Therefore, it was relatively easy to solve. The relocated farmers were given a small amount of financial assistance because the commune made overall arrangements for those who did not want to move far away, and mobilized the members of neighboring villages to help repair the houses. For those who moved to neighboring villages, they were given grain, vegetables, and grass like the local members. Therefore, they achieved double satisfaction (willing to go and welcome). Many commune members welcomed the "new members" like welcoming relatives and enthusiastically helped them build new homes. Fifty households from Tianjinwang in Juxian County moved to Donghuangjiabu Village. When they moved, Huangjiabu Village organized more than 50 people to help them move for three days, and the relocated masses were greatly moved. "In the past, moving was tearful, but now moving is joyful; in the past, moving was to escape famine, but now moving is to live in a new house; in the past, moving made you poor for three years, but now moving is different. Everywhere is your own home, thanks to the commune and the Communist Party."
    In short, the People's Commune, an organization that combines government and commune, can unify, organize, and mobilize the forces of all aspects and departments more closely due to the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and cooperate and support each other. Therefore, projects that would normally take two or three years to complete can now be completed in seven or eight months or at most one year. All these living facts irrefutably prove the vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune, a newly born social organization.
      Great Democracy, Great Freedom, Great Debate
    Reverse Rightism, Boost Enthusiasm
    The successful completion of the six major reservoirs is the result of completely defeating right-leaning ideas in the struggle between two ideologies and two roads, and is a glorious victory for implementing the general line, relying on the People's Commune, and launching a mass movement. At the beginning of the construction of the six major reservoirs, and during the construction process, various forms of right-leaning ideas and negative and timid emotions emerged inside and outside the Party. Some cadres believed that there were insurmountable contradictions between vigorously developing water conservancy construction and agricultural production; some believed that large-scale projects could only be undertaken by the state and funded by the state. They overemphasized the lack of materials and funds, exaggerated the difficulties, and did not see the many favorable conditions brought to water conservancy construction after the communization. Therefore, they hesitated and wavered in building large reservoirs, and their determination was not great and their confidence was insufficient. Technically, due to the constraints of mysterious views and conservative ideas, they emphasized following the rules and mechanically insisted that large-scale projects should "survey and design for three years and construct for five years," and "nothing can be done without experts." A few people even believed that the fewer projects the better, the smaller the scale the better, and used the excuse of "shortening the front and ensuring key points" to advocate shutting down projects, reflecting various right-leaning conservative ideas; among some of the masses, they were mainly afraid that the work points earned on the reservoir could not participate in the commune's distribution, afraid that participating in the water conservancy battalion (regiment) would not be free, afraid of hard work, and afraid of helping other reservoirs after completing the task, reflecting the contradiction between individual interests and collective interests. However, the vast majority of cadres and the masses disagreed with their views. Under the guidance of the general line, they followed the instructions of the provincial party committee and advocated resolutely continuing, believing that building large reservoirs and gradually eradicating the Yi-Shu River must be done and had the conditions to be done well. Therefore, party committees at all levels repeatedly conducted education on the great significance of building large reservoirs for developing farmland water conservancy, running county and commune industries, and consolidating the People's Commune in the entire party and among all cadres, strengthened the belief that it must be done, and resisted various right-leaning ideas from inside and outside the Party. And in the commune and various production brigades and production teams, from top to bottom, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, they launched a great democracy, great freedom, and great debate, debating "to completely eradicate the Yi-Shu River, completely change the face of nature, is it okay not to vigorously develop water conservancy and not to build large reservoirs?" "If we don't build large reservoirs, can we completely overcome drought and waterlogging disasters and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture?" "Does vigorously developing water conservancy mainly rely on the commune or simply rely on the state?" "Does vigorously building reservoirs affect agricultural production?" and so on. At the same time, they thoroughly carried out the propaganda of the general line and policies such as the decentralization of the People's Commune system, thereby powerfully refuting right-leaning conservative ideas and pessimistic arguments, and greatly improving the confidence of cadres and the masses in vigorously developing water conservancy. The cadres and the masses realized that as long as they resolutely listen to the Party, implement the general line, rely on the People's Commune, and fully utilize the infinite wisdom and strength of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, they can completely make "high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way." For places that do have difficulties, they were earnestly helped to solve them: if there was insufficient labor, the People's Commune made unified arrangements; if there was insufficient funds, they relied on the People's Commune to mobilize the masses to invest in materials, and at the same time, the state gave the necessary support; if there was insufficient technology, they adopted the method of surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously, combining technology with politics, combining technology with leadership and the masses, using teachers to lead apprentices, using the strong to lead the weak, and using the mass line to solve them. In this way, many difficulties were overcome one by one due to relying on the People's Commune, which further encouraged the determination of the broad masses to vigorously develop water conservancy, overcome right-leaning ideas and right-leaning emotions, and devoted themselves to the construction of reservoir projects with full confidence.
    In the construction process, in order to continuously boost the morale of the employees and maintain high labor enthusiasm, vigorous political work was carried out on the construction site, and construction site newsletters, wired broadcasts, propaganda sheds, big-character posters, clapper talks, operas, celebration meetings, appraisals, visits, etc. were organized, and the propaganda forms were diverse and rich. The construction site also established hero lists, martial arts arenas, naming platforms, and flag-raising, and continuously carried out a cyclical red flag competition movement with ten comparisons and ten races (comparing determination and enthusiasm, comparing speed and regularity, comparing awareness and attendance, comparing quantity and quality, comparing measures and safety, comparing unity and cooperation, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, comparing learning and invention, comparing life and thrift, comparing martial arts and health). The slogan was: "Work hard, work hard, and work cleverly, ensure quality and quantity and time, work efficiency leaps again and again, guarantees the early completion of the project." Thus, the competition wave was higher than the previous one. In order to make the competition movement develop in a balanced manner, five points were generally grasped: ① Grasp the backbone: each commune equipped the battalion and company with a strong leadership backbone to strengthen organizational leadership; ② Grasp the fine work: each commune adjusted the old, disabled, and weak personnel on the construction site, and equipped "elite soldiers and strong generals" based on the principle of promoting mutual promotion of agricultural production and water conservancy construction and subordinating current interests to long-term interests; ③ Grasp the tools: regularly check and repair tools, repair and use them as they are damaged; ④ Grasp loading and unloading: achieve fast loosening of soil, fast preparation of soil, and fast loading of soil; ⑤ Grasp the quality: ensure that each process meets the quality specifications. Therefore, labor organization was continuously improved, technological innovation was continuously deepened, work efficiency increased from low to high, and project progress was rapid. For example, the daily progress of the Rizhao Reservoir increased from 3,000 cubic meters in early March to 49,000 cubic meters, and the Tao Luo, Sishan, and Shijiusuo commune water conservancy regiments created a high work efficiency record of an average of 4.38 cubic meters per regiment, exceeding the national quota by more than one time. Heroic deeds emerged one after another, and model figures emerged in the thousands. A total of more than 51,000 model heroes and heroines and more than 800 red flag units were selected from the six major reservoirs, 718 new party members were developed, 845 new members of the Communist Youth League were developed, 2,122 activists for party building were trained, and 24,840 activists for league building were trained. The 12 members of the Zou Maoying Iron and Steel Girls Team of the Chengguan Battalion of the Xiaoshiyang Reservoir in Juxian County had an average daily work efficiency of 6.7 cubic meters each on a 400-meter haul distance. Their slogan is: "Learn from Xiang Xiuli, learn from Liu Hulan, exchange sweat for water to build the reservoir, and dedicate youth to change nature." Go wherever there is difficulty, and everyone takes going to the most difficult place as an honor. Wang Guilan, the female company commander of the Xujiaya Reservoir, led the entire company to break the ice and go into the water to carry out the foundation clearing battle in the cold winter weather, and fought continuously for three days and nights without leaving the front line. Under her impetus, the arduous foundation clearing task was quickly completed. Under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, and under the influence and promotion of the model actions of heroic model figures, the 150,000-strong army fighting on the construction site persisted in construction from severe cold to hot summer, regardless of wind and rain, overcoming various difficulties, and successfully completed the construction task.
        Everyone Offers Advice
      Inventions and Creations are Constantly Changing
    To successfully complete the arduous task of splitting mountains, blocking rivers, and locking dragons, it is necessary to rely not only on revolutionary soaring enthusiasm, but also on a spirit of drilling. After the communization, people's communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act was cultivated and improved. This spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm and scientific research was fully demonstrated on the construction sites of the six major reservoirs. In the construction process, a mass movement of everyone offering advice, technological innovation, and technological revolution was widely launched. In order to make technological innovation and tool reform develop in an organized and led manner, each construction site established a leading organization for technological innovation under the leadership of the construction site party committee. They grasped the principles of inventing and creating, testing and appraising, and manufacturing and promoting simultaneously. A total of more than 100 types and more than 30,000 pieces of new-style water conservancy construction tools were trial-produced and promoted in major reservoirs. The main ones are: 582 kilometers of wooden tracks, 15,000 meters of iron rails, 4,739 bucket trucks, 354 aerial soil conveyors, 485 steelyard soil conveyors, and 12,000 "creepers." The steelyard soil conveyor promoted by Tancheng has a work efficiency of more than 450,000 cubic meters per day and night. The creeper truck, automatic soil unloading device, pulley automatic soil loading device, Leap Forward ramming machine, single-line double-line soil conveying machine, and more than 20 other types of soil conveying machines promoted by the Xiaoshiyang Reservoir in Juxian County have all improved work efficiency by more than three or four times. Li Yongshi, a worker at the Xujiaya Reservoir, was a small handicraft worker who made iron kettles. Since joining the iron and wood factory of the People's Commune, his technology has been continuously improved. He created a wooden 10,000-jin crane to lift reinforced concrete lining pipes, improving work efficiency by six times. It is not only simple to operate and has high work efficiency, but also is safe. The wooden turnouts, scraping boards, wooden plank roads on sand, and two-way soil unloading trucks promoted by the Shen Ding Reservoir in Rizhao, especially the automatic switch soil conveying bucket trucks, have improved work efficiency by more than six times. The county's blasting company researched and implemented a new blasting method, and created a high record of blasting 5,096 cubic meters of soil and 7,016 cubic meters of stone with one shot, improving work efficiency by 180 times compared with worker operations. The county also created a method of mixing human manure and salt with explosives, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient explosives. After various places learned the experience of Rizhao's blasting with homemade explosives in time, the work efficiency quickly improved. This played an extremely important role in reducing physical labor and completing the project tasks ahead of schedule. The heroic people not only conquered the dragon that had swallowed the lives and property of the people for thousands of years, but also trained people. People conquered nature and became the masters of nature.
    Grasp the Project with One Hand
    Grasp the Life with the Other Hand
    Each construction site concentrated thousands of employees. Whether or not to do a good job in life and ensure safe production is one of the important tasks to ensure the smooth completion of the project. The commune can deliver the food rations for the employees on the construction site on time, in quantity, and in quality, and ensure the supply of green vegetables and oil and salt. At the same time, the communes and production teams often organized comfort groups to visit the construction site, not only introducing the production and life conditions of their own communes and teams, giving the employees spiritual encouragement; but also bringing green vegetables, tofu, oil, salt, and daily necessities such as towels and raincoats, which greatly encouraged the employees. While grasping ideology and grasping the project, the party committees at all levels also grasped food and lodging management, and grasped the project with one hand and life with the other. Each construction site has one or two main responsible cadres to specifically grasp this work. Some established a life management section and established a life committee. The battalion and company units also have a responsible cadre specifically in charge of food and lodging. Because of the good grasp of life and the regular grasp, it basically achieved good life adjustment, diversified meals, two warm and three cooked three hot meals, ensuring the health of all employees. In order to ensure the supply of daily necessities, each construction site has a grain and oil station, and also established service organizations such as retail stores, shoe repair groups, sewing groups, barber groups, and postal and telecommunications groups. Because people's socialist awareness has been improved and life has been well organized, a new atmosphere of everyone paying attention to hygiene and everyone loving cleanliness has emerged on the construction site. Diseases are treated in a timely manner, the incidence of disease is greatly reduced, attendance has increased from 75% at the beginning of construction to 95%, and the incidence of disease is only 0.5%. Under the slogan of safety first, the occurrence of work-related injuries has been greatly reduced and avoided due to vigorously taking safety measures. Construction site cultural and recreational life includes movies and dramas. Some construction sites compose, sing, and perform themselves, which has played a great role in boosting the morale of the employees.
          Thousands of Lines
      Party Leadership is the First Line
    With the People's Commune, a powerful collective force, we must also have the strong leadership of the Party. Building large reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters is unprecedented for our region's party and people. There is a lack of experience and many difficulties. Therefore, party committees at all levels have paid attention to strengthening leadership. On the one hand, they resolutely rely on the People's Commune, make up their minds, and do not waver or hesitate, and grasp it to the end; at the same time, they also fully value the difficulties that may be encountered, educate cadres and the masses to fully recognize the favorable conditions after the communization of the people, strengthen their confidence, and overcome difficulties. In order to solve the various difficulties encountered in a timely manner and unswervingly build the reservoir well, each county party committee has a secretary in charge, sitting in command, and 365 leading backbones and more than 1,400 capable cadres and technicians were transferred from the region, county, and commune to form a strong construction site party committee and engineering command, strengthening the political and ideological work on the construction site and the specific leadership of the project. Each regiment, battalion, and company also established a party general branch or branch, becoming the leading core of the construction site, fully playing the role of a fighting fortress and the backbone and leading role of party members and league members. Leading cadres at all levels implemented a hierarchical contract responsibility system, carried forward the fine style of "three samenesses and four personnel," and achieved the same food, the same housing, and the same labor. They were not only commanders, but also combatants, and not only technicians, but also propagandists. Thus, not only was the relationship between cadres and the masses close, greatly inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the employees, but more importantly, through labor, they went deep into the scene, discovered problems, solved them in a timely manner, cultivated typical examples, summarized experience, organized visits, and promoted advanced experience in a timely manner. Therefore, it is guaranteed that the employees have strong fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm, and the work efficiency is improving step by step. When implementing labor quotas at the Xujiaya Reservoir, Comrade Jing Shousheng, secretary of the county party committee, led the cadres of the battalion and company to participate in labor, personally explored the quotas for various projects, and after promotion, the work efficiency doubled. Facts have proved that where the party committee strengthens leadership and the secretary takes the lead, the migrant workers have sufficient enthusiasm, the project progress is fast, the quality is good, and the task can be completed on time and in quality. The completion of the six major reservoirs is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a victory for the People's Commune. Over the past year, the people of the entire region have further strengthened their belief that "man will conquer nature" and liberated their minds. According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the relevant instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, holding high the red flag of the general line and advancing victoriously on the existing basis, we plan to continue to resolutely complete the four major reservoirs of Yishui Bashan, Shuhe Qingfengling, Wenhe Andy, and Yiyuan Tianzhuang this winter and next spring, and strive for "three years of hard work to eradicate the Yi-Shu River and fundamentally change the natural landscape."

    人民公社锁蛟龙
    中共山东临沂地委会
    编者按：山东临沂专区以自力更生为主，国家支援为辅，一年之内修成六座大水库，这是了不起的成就，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是大跃进、人民公社的胜利。
    但是，有些地方在水利建设中却出现了“伸手”派和“困难”论者。“伸手”派，什么都向国家要，要经费，要材料，要技术人员；“困难”论者，认为没有专家是办不成事的，没有国家供应的钢筋水泥是修不成水库的，没有国家供应工具是难以施工的，没有足够的投资是寸步难行的。“伸手”派和“困难”论者都是眼睛望上，看着青天，看不见人。临沂地区的同志们恰好和他们相反，看到人的力量，看到人是历史的创造者，正是依靠人，胜利地完成了六大水库的建设。
    这是一篇很好的文章。在冬修水利运动就要全面开展的时候，这篇文章尤其值得仔细阅读。人民公社力胜天，挥戈劈岭改河山，千年蛟龙今锁住，万民欢乐尽开颜。人工大湖浩似海，碧波荡漾连青天，宝水滔滔流入库，潺潺含笑进田园。麦浪滚滚稻谷香，鹅鸭成群鱼满川，穷山变成鱼米乡，共产党恩情说不完。
    这是临沂地区人民群众对展现在面前的六座宽阔人工大湖的美丽图景的赞歌。
    临沂地区在广泛开展治山治水初步改变自然面貌的基础上，高举总路线的红旗，依靠人民公社的强大力量，在去年秋天突击秋收、秋种和大办钢铁的同时，开始修建许家崖、日照、小仕阳、陡山、唐村和会宝岭等平均蓄水二亿方以上的六座大水库。经过不到一年的艰苦奋战，有五处已胜利竣工，会宝岭水库也即将竣工。这是临沂地区首批大型水库工程。六大水库共土石沙方一千零三十四万方，坝身总长达十五华里，可以控制流域面积二千七百零七平方公里。由于拦腰斩断了温凉河、浚河、浔河、袁公河、西泇河和傅町河六大河流，汛期奔腾咆哮的洪水，在巍然屹立的大坝面前不得不低下头来。从此，结束了这些河流危害人民的历史，使五十万亩河床沙滩变成良田，九十万人民免受水灾。六大水库蓄水十四亿立方（约为一般雨水年总径流量的21％），可以灌溉农田二百九十多万亩，能建设大小发电站四十多处，年发电二千二百七十多万度。还可以发展多种经济，如养鱼、养鸭、养鹅，利用库边浅水种植藕、蒲、菱角等水生植物，每年价值可达数千万元。同时，还可以大力发展动力加工和交通运输事业。水库周围还可以大量种植各种树木、花草，增加收入，美化环境。广大人民群众对展现在面前的六大水库的美丽前景，都从心底里发出无比的喜悦。水，流到那里，就给那里带来了幸福。有的老年妇女听说水库放水，彻夜不眠，等待着水的到来。今年虽然蓄水还不多，但在抗旱保秋中，就初步发挥了它的作用。
        依靠人民公社
  把水利建设推向新阶段
    这六大水库的建成，标志着党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社化的光辉胜利。过去农业社办不到的，而今人民公社办到了。
    解放以来，英雄的临沂地区的人民，在党的正确领导下，依靠组织起来的力量，不断地向大自然进军，大力开展水土保持工作，从而初步改变了穷山恶水的自然面貌。可是，由于互助合作组织规模小，局限性大，因而无力举办大的农田水利工程。在互助组的时候，由于力量过于单薄，只能闸山沟、修塘坝和兴修几百方的小水库；合作化之后，力量大一些了，解决了互助组织所不能解决的矛盾，但是仍然由于受到各方面的限制而只能举办几千方、几万方至多几十万方的水库。从1954年至1958年人民公社化前，在五年多的过程中，共修中小水库四千三百十七座，蓄水二亿八千多万方，平均每个水库只蓄水六万七千方。其中像蓄水三千五百万多方的莒南虎园水库，则是国家举办的。人民公社一出现便不同了，由于它的规模大，活动范围广，更适合生产力的发展，虽然是红日初升，就迅速显示了强大的威力，把水利建设推向了新的阶段——举办高级农业社所难以举办的大水库。今年一年举办的六大水库的蓄水量就超过了以往五年举办水库蓄水总和的五倍。这应该说是一个奇迹！
    人民公社的优越性，首先表现在充分动员和合理使用劳力方面，较之高级农业社具有更大的优越性。公社人多势众，能够统一安排，全面照顾。在“水利建设、农业生产互相促进”的口号推动下，各公社都组织了水利营、水利连，同时，整顿组织了参加农业生产的队伍，因此，在参加建设水库的大军调走之后，农业生产不仅没有受影响，而且今年搞得比以往任何一年都好。以日照县为例，全县投入修建水库的劳动力达两万人之多，小麦获得空前大丰收，秋季作物虽然遭受四十多天未雨的严重灾害，除很少一部分早稻略次于去年外，其他作物均比大丰收的1958年好得多，预计全年产量仍可超过去年一成左右。为了提高工地民工的劳动积极性，早日实现建成水库的愿望，在家社员对于参加水利建设的社员，都照常记劳动工分，还帮助种好私留菜园，以及解决家庭生活中的一些特殊困难。这完全表现了人民公社化以后人们新的精神面貌。同时，由于成立了食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等福利事业，解放了大批妇女劳力，对农业生产发挥了很大作用。各县和各公社由于有了自己的工厂，都在水库工地上设了修配厂或修配组，随毁随修，对解决水库工具、提高工效起了重要作用。
    举办蓄水亿方以上的大水库，工程复杂，需要大量资金、物料，过去高级农业社根本无力解决，而人民公社，由于领导统一，物质基础雄厚，也就易于解决了。这六大水库，除了劳力是群众自己出的以外，还自带一部分口粮，国家只补贴很少一部分工资。六大水库共投资五千二百零六万八千元，其中依靠公社和群众解决的资金即达四千二百四十七万八千元，占投资总数的81.5％，而国家投资仅占应投资总数的18.5％。其余像水库上所必需的重要器材，如钢材、木材、水泥、炸药等，70％以上都是依靠公社和群众解决的。所有这些都充分证明：六大水库不是由国家包办的，而是由县统一领导和指挥，依靠人民公社的强大力量，加上国家必要支援举办起来的。如果没有人民公社化，要办这样的大水库，那是不可想像的。
    人民公社不仅给水库提供了雄厚的人力和物质条件，更重要的是提高了人们的思想觉悟，培养了人们的共产主义精神。工地上来自九个县一百一十个公社的十五万大军，充分表现了高尚的共产主义精神，他们不仅本县本社互相协作支援，而且县与县之间也掀起了友谊的大协作大支援。费县许家崖水库是六座水库中最大的一个，为了争取汛前完工，日照、临沂、郯城三县志愿支援一万一千人，自带工具前往。他们的口号是：“革命友谊似海深，四县人民心连心，志愿帮助兄弟县，根除水患除祸根，早日建成大水库，万民同享幸福春。”郯城、苍山、莒县、莒南四县还抽调拖拉机三十八部、七十多名拖拉机手，临沂、郯城、日照三县抽调了一千九百辆胶轮车，支援了这个水库。由于这种共产主义的无私精神，大大加快了工程进展。事实雄辩地证明，这种高尚的共产主义大协作，是社会主义建设和共产主义建设中不可缺少的，只有认真发扬这种精神，才能使我们伟大的建设事业搞得更多更快更好更省。当然，这种共产主义大协作，是要按照等价交换的原则去进行，而且要有组织有计划。为建设这六座大水库，共占用了土地十九万五千六百多亩，共迁移村庄一百十四个，一万二千一百五十多户，四万八千三百多人。这样大量占用土地和迁移村庄，如果在公社化以前，是难以解决的困难。然而在公社化后，不仅物质条件雄厚了，而且由于人们的共产主义风格提高了，能够自觉而愉快地使个人利益服从集体利益，目前利益服从长远利益，因此，也比较容易解决了。被迁移的农户，由于公社作了统筹安排，不愿远离的就给以少量资金补助，并动员邻近村的社员帮助修缮房屋；对于迁到邻村的，和当地社员一样分粮、分菜、分草，因此，达到了双满意（愿去、欢迎）。许多公社社员像迎接亲人一样，把“新社员”接去，热情地帮助他们建立新的家园。莒县天井汪迁到东黄家埠村五十户，在搬家时，黄家埠村组织了五十多人帮助搬家三天，被迁移的群众大受感动。“过去搬家泪汪汪，现在搬家喜洋洋；过去搬家是逃荒，现在搬家住新房；过去搬家三年穷，现在搬家不一样。到处都是自己的家，多亏公社和共产党。”
    总之，人民公社这个政社合一的组织，由于工农商学兵结合的更紧密，它可以统一组织调动各方面、各部门的力量，互相协作，互相支援，因此，按常规需要二、三年才能完成的工程，现在七、八个月至多一年就可以完成了。这一切活生生的事实无可辩驳地证明：人民公社这个新生的社会组织的旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性。
      大鸣大放大辩论
    反掉右倾，鼓足干劲
    六大水库的胜利完成，是在两种思想、两条道路的斗争中，彻底战胜右倾思想的结果，是贯彻总路线、依靠人民公社、大搞群众运动的光辉胜利。在六大水库开始施工，和在施工过程中，党内外曾经出现过形形色色的右倾思想和消极畏难情绪。一部分干部认为：大搞水利建设与农业生产存在着难以克服的矛盾；有的认为大型工程只能由国家举办，国家拨款。他们过分强调物料资金不足，夸大困难，看不到公社化以后给水利建设带来的许多有利条件，因而对举办大水库犹豫动摇，决心不大，信心不足。在技术上由于受神秘观点和保守思想的束缚，强调按部就班，机械地坚持大型工程要“三年勘察设计，五年施工”，“没有专家办不成”。还有少数人认为，工程越少越好，规模越小越好，以“缩短战线，保证重点”为借口，一味主张下马，反映了各种各样的右倾保守思想；在一部分群众中，主要怕在水库上挣的工分不能参加公社的分配，怕参加水利营（团）不自由，怕活重受累，怕完成了任务后还帮助其他水库等，反映了个人利益和集体利益的矛盾。但是，绝大多数的干部和群众与他们的意见相反，在总路线的指引下，遵照省委指示主张坚决办下去，认为举办大水库，逐步根治沂沭河，是必须办，而且有条件办好的。因此，各级党委在全党和全体干部中反复进行了兴建大水库对发展农田水利、举办县、社工业和巩固人民公社的重大意义教育，坚定了必办的信念，抵制了来自党内外的各种右倾思想。并在公社和各个生产大队、生产小队中，由上而下、由党内到党外、由干部到群众，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，辩论了“要彻底根治沂沭河，彻底改变自然面貌，不大搞水利、不修大水库行不行？”“不修大水库，能不能彻底战胜水旱灾害、争取农业大丰收？”“大搞水利主要是依靠公社，还是单纯依靠国家？”“大搞水库是否影响农业生产？”等等。同时，深入进行了总路线、人民公社体制下放等政策的宣传，从而有力地驳斥了右倾保守思想和悲观论调，大大提高了干部群众大办水利的信心。使干部和群众认识到：只要坚决听党的话，贯彻总路线，依靠人民公社，充分发挥广大干部和群众的无穷智慧和力量，完全可以叫“高山低头，河水让路”。对于确实存有困难的地方就认真帮助解决：劳力不足，人民公社进行统一安排；资金不足，依靠人民公社发动群众投资投料，同时，国家给以必要的支持；技术不足，就采取边勘察、边设计、边施工，技术与政治相结合，技术与领导与群众相结合，以师带徒，以强带弱，以群众路线的方法去解决。这样，许多困难，由于依靠了人民公社，都一个一个被克服了，从而更加鼓舞了广大群众大办水利的决心，克服了右倾思想和右倾情绪，满怀信心地投入了水库工程建设。
    在施工过程中，为了不断地鼓足员工的干劲，保持高涨的劳动热情，大力进行了工地政治工作，办起了工地战报、有线广播、宣传棚、大字报、快板、歌剧、庆功会、评比参观等等，宣传形式多种多样，丰富多采。工地上并以公社为单位设立了英雄榜、比武擂台、点将台、升降旗，连续开展了十比十赛的循环红旗竞赛运动（比决心赛干劲，比速度赛经常，比觉悟赛出勤，比数量赛质量，比措施赛安全，比团结赛协作，比多快赛好省，比学习赛发明，比生活赛节约，比练武赛卫生），口号是：“大干、苦干加巧干，保质保量保时间，工效跃再跃、翻再翻，保证工程提前完。”从而使竞赛浪潮一个高过一个。为使竞赛运动平衡发展，普遍抓住五条：①抓骨干：各个公社对营连都配备坚强的领导骨干，加强组织领导；②抓精工：各公社都本农业生产、水利建设互相促进和目前利益服从长远利益的原则，调换了工地上的老残病弱人员，配备“精兵强将”；③抓工具：常检查修配工具，随坏随修随利用；④抓装运：作到松土快，备土快，上土快；⑤抓质量：保证各个工序达到质量规格要求。因此，劳动组织不断改善，技术革新不断深入开展，工效由低到高，工程进展迅速。如日照水库由3月上旬日进度三千方提高到四万九千方，并有涛雒、丝山、石臼公社水利团，创造全团平均四点三八方的高工效纪录，超过国家定额的一倍以上。英雄事迹层出不穷，模范人物成千上万。六大水库共评选出模范英雄人物五万一千余名，红旗单位八百多个，发展新党员七百一十八人，发展团员八百四十五人，培养建党积极分子二千一百二十二名，建团积极分子二万四千八百四十名。莒县小仕阳水库城关营邹茂英钢铁姑娘队十二人，每人一辆小车在四百米的运距上，平均日工效六点七方。她们的口号是：“学习向秀丽，学习刘胡兰，以汗换水建成库，献上青春改自然。”哪里有困难就到哪里去，人人以到最困难的地方去为光荣。许家崖水库妇女连长王桂兰，在严冬数九天气，带领全连破冰下水进行清基战斗，连战三昼夜不下火线，在她的推动下，迅速完成了艰巨的清基任务。在党的领导鼓舞下、在英雄模范人物的模范行动影响推动下，战斗在工地上的十五万大军，从严寒到酷暑，不管风吹雨打，一直坚持施工，克服了种种困难，胜利完成了施工任务。
        人人献计献策
      发明创造日新月异
    要顺利完成劈山拦河锁蛟龙的艰巨任务，不但要靠革命的冲天干劲，而且要有钻劲。公社化以后，培养和提高了人们的敢想敢说敢为的共产主义风格。这种冲天干劲和科学研究相结合的精神，在六大水库工地上充分表现出来了。在施工过程中，广泛地开展了人人献计策、群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。为了使技术革新和工具改革有组织有领导的深入开展，各工地都在工地党委的领导下，设立了技术革新的领导组织。掌握了：边发明创造，边试验鉴定，边制造推广的原则。各大水库共试制和推广新式水利施工工具一百余种，三万余件。主要的有：木轨道五百八十二公里，铁轨一万五千米，斗车四千七百三十九辆，空中运土器三百五十四个，秤杆式运土器四百八十五个，“爬山虎”一万二千辆。郯城推广的秤杆式运土器，一昼夜工效达四十五万方以上。莒县小仕阳水库推广的爬山虎小车、自动卸土器、轱辘马自动上土器、跃进打夯机、单线双线运土机等二十余种，都提高工效三、四倍以上。许家崖水库工人李永士，是一个打铁壶的小手工业者，自从参加人民公社的铁木工厂以来，技术不断改进提高，他创造木制万斤起重机，起重钢筋混凝土衬管，提高工效六倍，不仅操作简便，工效高，而且安全。日照沈町水库推广的木道叉、刮沙板、沙滩木板道、两边卸土车，特别是自动开关运土斗车，提高工效六倍多。该县爆破连研究推行了新的爆破法，首创一炮炸土五千零九十六方，炸石七千零十六公方的高额纪录，比工人操作提高工效一百八十倍。该县并创造了人粪、食盐拌炸药，克服了炸药不足的困难。各地及时学习了日照爆破土制炸药的经验后，工效迅速提高。这对减轻体力劳动，提前完成工程任务起到极为重要的作用。英雄的人们不但征服了千百年来吞噬人民生命财产的蛟龙，而且也锻炼了人。人们征服了自然，变成了自然的主人。
    一手抓工程
    一手抓生活
    各个工地上，都集中了成千上万的员工，能否搞好生活和保证安全生产，是保证工程顺利竣工的重要工作之一。各个公社对于工地员工的口粮，都能按时按量按质送到，并保证了青菜和油盐供应。同时，各公社、生产队还经常组织慰问团到工地慰问，不仅介绍本社本队的生产生活情况，给广大员工以精神上的鼓励；而且还带来青菜、豆腐、油、盐和手巾、蓑衣之类的生活必需品，对员工鼓舞很大。各地党委在大抓思想、大抓工程的同时，大抓食宿管理，做到一手抓工程，一手抓生活。各工地均有一、二个主要负责干部专门抓这项工作，有的设立生活管理科，成立生活委员会，营连单位也有一个负责干部专管食宿。由于对生活抓的好，抓的经常，基本上达到了生活调剂好，饭菜多样化，两暖三熟三热，保证了全体员工的身体健康。为了保证生活必需品的供应，各工地都设粮油站，还建立了零售店、补鞋组、缝衣组、理发组、邮电组等服务组织。由于人们的社会主义觉悟提高了，生活又组织得好，因此，工地上呈现了人人讲卫生，个个爱清洁的新风尚。疾病治疗及时，发病率大大减低，出勤由开始施工的75％提高到95％，发病率仅0.5％。在安全第一的口号下，由于大力采取安全措施，大大减少和避免了工伤事故的发生。工地文娱生活，有电影、戏剧，有的工地自编自唱自演，对鼓舞广大员工情绪起了很大作用。
          千条万条
      党的领导是第一条
    有了人民公社这个强大的集体力量，还要有党的坚强领导。兴办蓄水一亿方以上的大水库，对我区的党和人民来说，是史无前例的，缺乏经验，困难很多。因此，各级党委都注意了加强领导，一方面坚决依靠人民公社，下定决心，不动摇不犹豫，一抓到底；同时，也充分重视可能遇到的困难，教育干部和群众充分认识人民公社化以后的有利条件，坚定信心，克服困难。为了及时解决遇到的各种困难，坚定不移地把水库修好，各县委都有一位书记挂帅，坐阵指挥，并由地、县、社抽调三百六十五名领导骨干和一千四百多名得力干部和技术员，组成坚强的工地党委会和工程指挥部，加强了工地的政治思想工作和工程的具体领导。各团、营、连也建立了党总支或支部，成为工地的领导核心，充分发挥了战斗堡垒作用和党团员的骨干带头作用。各级领导干部实行分级包干责任制，发扬“三同四员”的优良作风，做到同吃同住同劳动，既是指挥员，又是战斗员、既是技术员，又是宣传员。从而不仅干群关系亲密无间，大大启发了广大员工的劳动热情，而且更重要的是通过劳动，深入现场，发现问题，及时解决，培养典型，总结经验，组织参观，及时推广了先进经验。从而，保证广大员工有旺盛的斗志和冲天的干劲，工效步步提高。许家崖水库，在推行劳动定额时，县委书记荆守胜同志带领营连干部参加劳动，亲自摸索出各项工程的定额，推广后，工效倍增。事实证明：那里党委加强了领导，书记挂了帅，那里的民工干劲就足，工程进度就快、质量也就好，就能按时按质完成任务。六大水库的建成，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是大跃进、人民公社的胜利。全区人民一年来，进一步坚定了“人定胜天”的信念，解放了思想。根据党的八届八中全会精神和省委有关指示精神，在已有基础上，高举总路线的红旗，乘胜前进，计划今冬明春继续坚决完成沂水跋山、沭河青峰岭、汶河岸堤和沂源田庄四大水库，为“苦战三年，根治沂沭河，基本改变自然面貌”而奋斗。
