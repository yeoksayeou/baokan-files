Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The State Council's directive on mobilizing the masses to widely collect and fully utilize wild plant materials

October 11, 1959

The situation of the continued leap forward in the national economy requires rural areas to provide a greater variety and quantity of agricultural and sideline products and native specialties. This autumn, many agricultural and sideline products have achieved bumper harvests, and the amount of procurement will increase significantly, but it still cannot fully meet the rapidly growing needs of all sectors. At present, a large portion of wild plant materials has not been collected and utilized. Therefore, we must mobilize the broad masses of farmers to widely collect and fully utilize wild plants as an important supplementary source of agricultural and sideline products and native specialties. Our country is extremely rich in wild plant materials, with over a thousand species already discovered that can be utilized, including wild oil plants, wild fibers, wild starches, wild chemical raw materials, and wild medicinal materials (wild medicinal materials are medicines that our people have traditionally collected, processed, and used, and this work must be strengthened now and in the future, and absolutely cannot be ignored), etc. Further utilizing these raw materials more fully can increase a large amount of industrial raw materials, consumer goods, and export goods for the country, and can increase a large amount of income for the people's communes and farmers, which is extremely beneficial to the country, the communes, and the people. The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should, in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Utilizing and Collecting Wild Plant Materials in Our Country" of April 1958, further implement the policy of "investigation and research, overall planning, full utilization, and active development." During the current harvest season for wild plants, the collection, processing, procurement, and transportation of these raw materials must be treated as an important component of the entire autumn harvest and procurement of agricultural products, as a kind of "secondary autumn harvest" and "minor autumn harvest," given sufficient attention, and strengthened leadership, practical arrangements, and vigorous efforts to do a good job. To this end, the State Council now issues the following instructions:

(1) Mobilize the broad masses, utilize production gaps, squeeze out time, and launch a mass short-term shock campaign to collect all usable wild plant materials. The production areas of these plants are relatively scattered, and the seasonal nature of their maturity is very high. All localities must, while ensuring the harvest and procurement of major agricultural products, make overall arrangements and unified deployments, allocate and organize the necessary full and part-time labor according to local conditions, and mobilize and organize all men and women, young and old, who can participate in this work to go up the mountains, into the forests, and into the grasslands in a planned and organized manner, and complete the collection task in a relatively short period of time through a concentrated effort.

(2) The collection and processing of wild plant materials should implement a policy of both collective and individual management. Generally speaking, wild raw materials with large production volumes, concentrated production areas, high income, large investment, high technical requirements, and high labor needs should be managed by production teams or production brigades under the unified leadership of the people's communes, and some can also be directly managed by the communes. For wild raw materials with small production volumes that are scattered and sporadic, commune members and their families should be encouraged to collect and manage them themselves during their spare time. The distribution of income from individual management can be based on who collects it gets it, or it can be divided between public and private, which will be decided by each locality according to its actual situation.

(3) Farmers should be educated that when collecting wild plant materials, they must protect the vitality of wild plants so that they can continue to reproduce and not deplete the resources. For those wild plants with greater economic value, high demand, and insufficient production, artificial cultivation should also be promoted under possible conditions to improve variety and quality, transform wild plants into domesticated plants, to develop production and ensure needs.

(4) Commercial departments and local processing departments should actively organize the procurement and processing of wild plant materials collected by people's communes, production teams, and farmers. Commercial departments should, in conjunction with local industry, agriculture, forestry, scientific research, and other relevant departments, earnestly strengthen technical guidance, stipulate product specifications and standards, and organize the supply of necessary production tools and equipment. At the same time, they should also stipulate reasonable purchase prices, so that farmers are happy to collect them and factories are happy to use them. When mobilizing farmers to collect, all localities should first explain to the farmers which ones can be used and which ones cannot be used at present, and widely exchange experience in collection and processing in order to improve labor efficiency and prevent waste.

The People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government are requested to conduct a review of the work in this area in the past and, in accordance with the above instructions, further make overall plans and unified arrangements to facilitate the planned development of this work. At present, all localities should seize the opportunity, oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and launch a massive "minor autumn harvest movement" to collect wild plant materials.

　　国务院指示各地开展一个声势浩大的“小秋收运动”
    广泛采集充分利用野生植物
    新华社11日讯　国务院关于发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示
    1959年10月11日
    国民经济继续跃进的形势，要求农村提供品种更多、数量更大的农副产品和土特产品。今年秋季许多农副产品获得丰收，收购量将会大量增加，但是仍然不能充分满足各方面迅速增长的需要。目前野生植物原料中还有很大一部分没有采集和利用，因此，我们必须动员广大农民广泛采集和充分利用野生植物，把它作为农副产品和土特产品的重要补充来源。我国野生植物原料极为丰富，已经发现的可资利用的共有一千多种，包括野生油料、野生纤维、野生淀粉、野生化工原料、野生药材（野生药材是我国人民历来采集、加工和服用的药物，现在和今后更必须加强这个工作，绝对不能忽视），等等。进一步把这些原料更充分地利用起来，可以为国家增加大量的工业原料、消费资料和出口物资，可以给人民公社和农民增加大量收入，于国于社于民都极为有利。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，应当根据国务院1958年4月“关于利用和收集我国野生植物原料的指示”，进一步贯彻执行“调查研究、全面规划、充分利用、积极发展”的方针。在目前野生植物的成熟季节，更必须把这些原料的采集、加工、收购和调运，作为整个秋季农产品收获和收购的重要组成部分，作为一种“副秋收”和“小秋收”，给予足够的重视，并加强领导，切实安排，大力做好。为此，国务院现作如下指示：
    （一）发动广大群众，利用生产间隙，挤出时间，开展群众性的短期突击运动，把可以利用的野生植物原料统通采集起来。这些植物产地比较分散，成熟期的季节性很大，各地必须在保证主要农产品收获和收购的同时，统筹安排，统一部署，根据当地情况，调配和组织必要的全劳动力和半劳动力，并且把一切可以参加这一工作的男女老少都动员和组织起来，有计划地、有组织地上山、入林、进草原，用较短的时间突击完成采集任务。
    （二）野生植物原料的采集和加工，应当实行集体经营和个人经营同时并举的方针。一般说来，生产量大、产地集中、收入多、投资大、技术性较强、需要劳动力较多的野生原料，应当在人民公社的统一领导下，以生产队或者生产大队为单位进行经营，有的也可以由公社直接经营。生产量小、零星分散的野生原料，应当鼓励社员个人及其家属利用工余时间自己进行采集经营。个人经营收入的分配，可以实行谁采谁得，也可以实行公私分成，由各地根据实际情况自行决定。
    （三）应当教育农民，在采集野生植物原料的时候，必须保护野生植物的生机，使它能够继续繁殖，不要枯本竭源。对于那些经济价值较大、需要量大、而生产不足的野生植物，还要在可能条件下提倡人工培育，改进品种质量，变野生为家生，以发展生产，保证需要。
    （四）人民公社、生产队和农民采集的野生植物原料，商业部门和当地加工部门应当积极组织收购和加工；商业部门应该会同地方工业、农业、林业、科学研究等有关部门，切实加强技术指导，规定产品的规格标准，组织必需的生产工具、生产设备的供应。同时，还应当规定合理的收购价格，既使农民乐于采集，又使工厂乐于使用。各地在发动农民进行采集的时候，应当先向农民说清楚，那些是可以利用的，那些是现在还无法利用的，并且广泛地交流采集和加工的经验，以便提高劳动效率，防止浪费。
    请各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，对于过去时期这方面的工作，进行一次检查，并且根据上述指示，进一步作出全面规划和统一安排，以利这一工作有计划地开展。目前各地应当抓紧时机，反右倾，鼓干劲，充分调动群众的积极性，开展一个声势浩大的采集野生植物原料的“小秋收运动”。
