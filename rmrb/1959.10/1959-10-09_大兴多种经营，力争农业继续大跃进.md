Now, the "Three Autumns" campaign is fiercely unfolding in the vast countryside, with scenes of bountiful harvests everywhere. The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are inspiring the masses of peasants and cadres at all levels; the attendance rate and labor efficiency of commune members are continuously improving; hundreds of thousands of rural work cadres are "camping" in the fields with the masses, working hard, practically, and cleverly. Many places have already proposed to overfulfill this year's production plans for grain, cotton, and other major crops; and they have also proposed that the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should increase by about 15% compared to last year. Disaster-stricken areas are striving to "compensate for the reduction in the autumn harvest with the late autumn harvest, compensate for the loss of grain with vegetables, and compensate for the reduction in agriculture with sideline occupations." Areas that have not been affected by disasters are striving to overproduce more, ensuring a bumper harvest to make up for the deficient areas and support disaster areas. From a global perspective, the situation on the agricultural production front is very good, and it is appropriate to take advantage of the momentum and strive to overfulfill this year's total agricultural output value plan in the last two months of the year, and welcome 1960 with even greater victories.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total output value of various agricultural sectors in China increased by 25%; last year alone, the total output value of various agricultural sectors in China increased by another 25%. On the basis of last year's special Great Leap Forward, increasing the total output value of various agricultural sectors by more than 10% to about 15% this year is a huge task, but also one that can be accomplished. The people's communes have become more sound and consolidated, the masses' enthusiasm for production is even higher, the cadres' leadership experience is richer, and the mass movement for increased production is magnificent and orderly. These are all very favorable conditions for striving for more increased production. Although there are only about eighty days left from now until the end of the year, there is still much to be done by seizing this time and working hard – there is still much to be done in late autumn, much to be done with vegetables, and even more to be done in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, especially in the collection of wild plants and dried fruits. In addition to doing our best to meticulously harvest and manage the fields of late autumn and vegetables without slackening for a moment, in order to increase the total agricultural output value this year, we must fully mobilize the masses in the coming months and make great efforts to develop diversified economy. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session on carrying out the movement for increasing production and practicing economy pointed out: "After the autumn harvest, it is necessary to rationally arrange labor forces and strengthen diversified economy in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries." This is the direction of rural work in the coming months. All people's communes in various places should timely allocate labor forces, have everyone participate, and gather treasures everywhere, so that diversified economy will undergo an unprecedented development.

Doing so meets the needs of national construction and people's lives. A considerable proportion of the means of livelihood and means of production, industrial and handicraft raw materials, and export goods are products of diversified economy in rural areas. In addition to agricultural products, animal products, aquatic products, and forestry products, there are also many wild oilseeds and brewing raw materials, dried and fresh fruits, mountain delicacies and wild game, medicinal materials, spices, furs, stones, charcoal, lime, straw braids, ropes, baskets, mats, and so on. Countless "treasures of nature" come from the skillful hands of farmers engaged in sideline occupations. The short-distance transportation that is indispensable in the national economy, and the manufacture of many production tools and daily furniture used by farmers, are also important items in rural diversified economy. These products are both necessary for production and life, and have a broad market, requiring a large increase in production.

Doing so is in line with the policy of people's communes to develop production and the demands of commune members. The production of people's communes must simultaneously promote commodity production and self-sufficiency, and must comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Only in this way can we give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, which are large in organizational scale, have a wide range of operations, and are convenient for unified production arrangements and unified use of manpower and materials. Only in this way can we facilitate the close integration of the commune economy and the entire national economy, facilitate mutual support among the various departments of the commune, and facilitate the rapid development of commune production and the gradual improvement of commune members' lives. If communes are to have more funds and commune members are to have more cash income, they must open up more avenues in diversified economy. There are many diversified economy projects, and the products are scattered and small, but they add up to a large amount. Some places have proposed that in the fourth quarter, on average, each person should increase net income by six yuan or increase output value by six yuan from diversified economy in addition to the original agricultural production plan. Calculating the national rural population at an average increase in output value of six yuan per person, all communes across the country can increase by more than 3 billion yuan in total. This newly increased 3 billion yuan can not only increase the income of commune members, but also increase the accumulation of communes and production teams, adding a large amount of funds for expanded reproduction next year.

It should be particularly pointed out that increasing production by more than 3 billion yuan in addition to the original plan means that China's total agricultural output value this year (including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries) will increase by more than 15% compared to last year. This also means that this year's agricultural production will achieve a continued Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's special Great Leap Forward. Didn't the mediocre people of imperialism and the right-leaning opportunists say that we would not be able to achieve a continued Great Leap Forward this year? In fact, they are really blind! China's industrial production will increase by more than 25% this year, and the Great Leap Forward is definitely certain. Now it depends on whether we can use these two months to strive to increase production by another 3 billion yuan from diversified economy in the agricultural sector, that is, to increase by another 5% after increasing by 10% compared to last year, reaching an increase of 15%. If we achieve this, China's agricultural production this year will achieve a continued Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's special Great Leap Forward.

Can we achieve this in these two months? Our answer is yes. Diversified economy can produce quick results. Many people's communes have strengthened the leadership of diversified economy since the spring of this year in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and have already created remarkable achievements. For example, in various communes in Xiuyan County, Liaoning, by the end of July, the income from various operations other than agriculture was more than 4.6 million yuan (not including self-produced and self-sold portions, commune-run industries, and large-scale income from tobacco and tussah silkworms), with an average income of more than 70 yuan per household, which is equivalent to the income of several more acres of land per household, more than doubling the same period last year. In Jiepai Commune, Binghui County, Anhui, the income from various operations other than agriculture in the first half of the year reached more than 670,000 yuan, more than nine times the same period last year; in the summer distribution, the income from various operations other than agriculture accounted for 47% of the total distribution. The management projects of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in Yangjiatan Commune, Lianyuan County, Hunan, have more than doubled compared to before the communeization; from January to early September, the total value of agricultural and sideline products sold to the state reached 1.76 million yuan (of which grain only accounted for 480,000 yuan). These communes have already used the income from diversified economy to purchase agricultural machinery, small-scale power generation equipment, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and many other means of production, developed new industries, water conservancy, and welfare undertakings, paid wages to commune members, further strengthened the production force of the communes, and improved the enthusiasm of commune members for production. The next eighty days, especially after the autumn harvest, are the peak season for sideline production. We must be well prepared, seize the opportunity of every day, vigorously engage in sideline production, do more, do it quickly, and set off a great upsurge of everyone engaging in diversified economy. Communes affected by disasters should vigorously engage in sideline occupations in order to make up for losses and overcome difficulties in production and life. In the coming months, sideline production in the vast countryside will have great development. This is an inevitable trend. The leadership must see the situation clearly, guide it accordingly, and regard diversified economy as one of the main contents of the winter production upsurge, launch a mass movement, and strive for complete victory.

Local county party committees and commune party committees should consult with comrades from relevant departments such as industry, agriculture, commerce, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries to make specific plans for carrying out diversified economy in rural areas this winter as early as possible. First, we must make appropriate arrangements for the labor force needed to carry out diversified economy (including sideline occupations, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, industry, handicrafts, and transportation) and the labor force needed for water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and winter field management, taking into account overall planning and coordination. Those that can be combined should be combined (such as going up the mountain to build water conservancy and find fertilizer sources can be combined with afforestation, grazing, picking mountain fruits, collecting wild plants, hunting, etc.), and those that cannot be combined should have clear division of labor. Second, we must determine the specific projects to be carried out in diversified economy according to local conditions and timing. We must study how to comprehensively arrange production tasks such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar crops, silkworms, tea, vegetables, hemp, and medicinal materials in accordance with certain proportions according to local conditions. We must find out the situation of resources, technical forces, tools and equipment, and implement the supply of raw materials, tool repair, technology transfer, product specifications, quantities, and sales under the premise of great development. On the one hand, we must carry forward the good traditions of the past, and on the other hand, we must open up a broad new world. Third, we must clearly divide the scope and projects of collective management (commune-run, team-run, and small team-run) and commune member family management, which should be conducive to collective production and give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties. All those suitable for collective production should be managed centrally by the commune or production team; for those suitable for decentralized production by commune member families, the commune and production team should help commune members solve difficulties in raw materials, sales, and technology, and can also incorporate this part of commune member decentralized production into a unified plan through this method.

China's rural areas have abundant resources for developing diversified economy, and great resources are waiting for hardworking and brave commune members to develop. "Hate that goods are abandoned on the ground, not necessarily hidden for oneself; hate that strength is not exerted, not necessarily for oneself." This ideal of the "Great Harmony" in the "Book of Rites" is being realized in the people's communes. It is now the right time to make great use of the benefits of mountains, rivers, plants, and trees. Facts have long proven that for socialist construction, for a better life for all the people of the country, heroic commune members are not afraid of high mountains and deep waters, and even less afraid of the cold weather. Going up the mountains and down the rivers, all routes are activated; "The Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their unique abilities." From autumn to spring, let us launch a vigorous mass movement on the front of diversified economy in rural areas that benefits the country and the people, strive to overfulfill this year's total agricultural output value plan, achieve a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year, and promote a continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production next year!

    大兴多种经营，力争农业继续大跃进
    现在广大农村，“三秋”大战正在炽烈展开，到处是一片丰收景象。党的八中全会的决议鼓舞着农民群众和各级干部，社员的出勤率和劳动效率不断提高；几十万农村工作干部同群众一起在田头“安营扎寨”苦干实干巧干。许多地方已经提出超额完成今年粮食、棉花等主要作物的生产计划；并且纷纷提出：农、林、牧、副、渔的总产值要比去年增长15％左右。受灾地区，正在努力做到“大秋减产晚秋补，粮食丢了蔬菜补，农业减产副业补”。没有受灾的地区，更是力争多超产，确保丰产丰收，以丰补歉，支援灾区。从全局来看，农业生产战线的形势十分良好，正宜乘风破浪，争取在今年最后两个多月的时间内，超额完成今年的农业总产值计划，用更大的胜利迎接1960年。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国农业各部门的总产值提高25％；去年一年，我国农业各部门的总产值又提高25％。在去年特大跃进的基础上，今年一年再把农业各部门的总产值提高10％以上以至15％左右，这是一个巨大的任务，同时也是能够完成的任务。人民公社已经更加健全和巩固，群众的生产热情更加高涨，干部的领导经验更加丰富，增产运动规模壮阔而且井然有序，这些都是争取更多增产的十分有利的条件。从现在到年底，虽然只有大约八十天的时间了，但是，狠狠抓紧这段时间大干特干，仍然大有可为——晚秋还大有可为，蔬菜还大有可为，林、牧、副、渔等业，特别是野生植物和干果的采集，更大有可为。除了在精收细打和晚秋、蔬菜的田间管理等方面不放松片刻时机尽力做好以外，为了增加今年农业的总产值，今后几个月要充分发动群众，在开展多种经营方面大做文章。八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议中已经指出：“在秋后必须合理地安排劳动力，加强林、牧、副、渔等业的多种经营。”这是今后几个月农村工作的方向。各地各个人民公社都要及时地调配劳动力，人人动手，处处取宝，让多种经营来一个空前的大发展。
    这样做，是符合国家建设和人民生活的需要的。相当大一部分的生活资料和生产资料，工业和手工业原料以及出口物资，都是农村的多种经营的产品。除了农产品、畜产品、水产品、林产品之外，还有许多野生的油料和酿酒原料，干果鲜果，山珍野味，药材，香料，皮毛，石料，木炭，石灰，草辫，绳索，筐篮，席箔，等等，说不尽的“物华天宝”，都来自农民经营副业的巧妙的双手。国民经济中必不可少的短途运输，农民用的许多生产工具和日用家具的制造，也都是农村多种经营的重要项目。这些产品既是生产和生活所必需，又有着宽广的市场，需要大量增产。
    这样做，是符合人民公社发展生产的方针和社员群众的要求的。人民公社的生产，必须实行商品生产和自给性生产同时并举，必须农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展。只有这样，才有利于充分发挥人民公社组织规模大、经营范围广、便于统一安排生产、统一使用人力物力的优越性。只有这样，才有利于公社经济和整个国民经济的密切结合，才有利于公社的各部门之间互相支援，才有利于公社生产的迅速发展和社员生活的逐步提高。公社要有更多的资金，要使社员有更多的现金收入，必须在多种经营方面广辟门路。多种经营项目繁多，星星点点的产品分散开来很少，但是集腋成裘，总计起来就是一个很大的数目。有些地方提出：第四季度平均每人在原有农业生产计划之外要再从多种经营方面增加纯收入六元或者增加产值六元。以全国农村人口每人平均增加产值六元计算，全国各个公社总共就可以增加三十多亿元。这新增加的三十多亿元，不但可以增加社员的收入，而且可以增加公社和生产队的积累，为明年的扩大再生产增加大量的资金。
    特别应当指出的是，在原订计划之外再增产三十多亿元，这就是说我国今年的农业（包括农、林、牧、副、渔各业）总产值将比去年增长15％以上。这也就是说，今年的农业生产，将在去年特大跃进的基础上实现继续大跃进。帝国主义的庸人们和右倾机会主义分子不是说我们今年不能实现继续大跃进吗？其实他们真是瞎了眼睛！我国的工业生产今年将比去年增产25％以上，大跃进是肯定无疑了。现在就看在农业方面我们能否利用这两个多月的时间，争取从多种经营方面再增产三十多亿元，就是说在比去年增长10％之后再增产5％，达到增长15％。做到了这点，我国今年的农业生产就是在去年特大跃进的基础上实现继续大跃进了。
    能不能在这两个多月中做到这点？我们的回答是肯定的。多种经营是能够迅速见效的。许多人民公社从今年春天就按照党的八届六中全会的决议，加强了对多种经营的领导，已经创造了显著的成绩。如辽宁岫岩县各个公社，到7月底为止，农业以外的各种经营的收入就有四百六十多万元（还不包括自产自销部分、社办工业和大宗收入的烟草和柞蚕），平均每户收入七十多元，等于每户多了几亩地的收入，比去年同时期增加一倍多。安徽炳辉县界牌公社，上半年农业以外的各种经营的收入达到六十七万多元，比去年同期增加九倍多；在夏季分配中，农业以外的各种经营的收入占全部分配数的47％。湖南涟源县杨家滩公社的林、牧、副、渔等业的经营项目，比公社化以前增加了一倍多；从1月到9月上旬，向国家出售的农副产品总值达一百七十六万元（其中粮食只占四十八万元）。这些公社，已经用多种经营的收入购买了农业机械、小型发电设备、农药、化学肥料和其他许多生产资料，发展了新的工业、水利和福利事业，给社员发了工资，进一步加强了公社的生产力量，提高了社员的生产热情。未来的八十多天，特别是秋收以后，更是副业生产的旺季。必须做好准备，不失一天时机，大搞副业生产，要搞的多，搞的快，掀起一个人人动手大搞多种经营的大高潮。受灾的公社，为了弥补损失，克服生产上和生活上的困难，更要大搞副业。在今后几个月内，广大农村的副业生产会有极大的发展。这是必然的趋势。领导方面必须看清形势，因势利导，把多种经营作为冬季生产高潮的主要内容之一，大搞群众运动，力争取得全面大胜。
    各地县委和公社党委，要同当地工、农、商、林、牧、渔等有关部门的同志们一起商量，及早作出今冬在农村开展多种经营的具体规划。一、要把开展多种经营（包括副业、林业、牧业、渔业、工业、手工业和运输）所需要的劳动力和兴修水利、积肥、越冬作物田间管理所需要的劳动力作适当的安排，统筹兼顾，能结合进行的就结合进行（像上山修水利、找肥源就可以同造林、放牧、采摘山果、采集野生植物、打猎等等结合起来），不能结合的就明确分工。二、要因地制宜、因时制宜，确定开展多种经营的具体项目，要研究如何按照本地条件把粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、蚕丝、茶叶、蔬菜、麻类、药材等项生产任务按照一定的比例，全面地加以安排。要把资源、技术力量、工具设备等情况摸清楚，要在大发展的前提下把原料供应、工具修造、技术传授、产品规格、数量和销路等等落实。一方面要发扬过去的好传统，另方面要开辟广阔的新天地。三、要把集体经营（社办、队办、小队办）和社员家庭经营的范围和项目划分清楚，既要有利于集体生产，又要把各方面的积极性充分发挥出来。凡是适宜于集体生产的，应由公社或生产队集中经营；凡是适宜于社员家庭分散生产的，公社、生产队应当在原料、销路、技术等方面帮助社员解决困难，并且可以通过这种方式把社员分散生产的这一部分也纳入统一的计划。
    我国农村开展多种经营的资源十分丰富，大好的资源正待勤劳勇敢的公社社员们去开发。“货恶其弃于地也，不必藏于己；力恶其不出于身也，不必为己。”“礼运大同篇”的这个理想，正在人民公社里实现。大兴山水草木之利，现在正是时候。事实早已证明：为了社会主义建设，为了全国人民都生活得更加美好，英雄的公社社员不怕山高水深，更不怕天寒地冻。上山下水，各路出动；“八仙过海，各显其能。”从秋后到春前，让我们在农村的多种经营的战线上开展一个利国利民的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，力争超额完成今年的农业总产值计划，实现今年农业生产大跃进，促进明年农业生产继续大跃进！
