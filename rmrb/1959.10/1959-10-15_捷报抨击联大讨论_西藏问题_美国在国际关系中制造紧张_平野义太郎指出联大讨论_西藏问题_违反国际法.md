　　The Czechoslovak Press Criticizes the UN General Assembly's Discussion of the "Tibet Question"
　　The United States Creates Tension in International Relations
　　Hirano Yoshitaro Points Out That the UN General Assembly's Discussion of the "Tibet Question" Violates International Law
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 14th—"Red Right" and "Slovak Truth" published commentaries today on the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibet Question."
　　The commentary in "Red Right" said that putting the so-called "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly can only be regarded as a dirty trick with inflammatory purposes.
　　The commentary emphasized that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and discussing this issue is contrary to the United Nations Charter. If those who propose putting the "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly try to conceal their evil intentions by invoking the Declaration of Human Rights and using the pretext of caring about the civil and religious rights of the Tibetan people, then they are extremely hypocritical.
　　The commentary pointed out that the Tibetan rebels want to keep the Tibetan people permanently enslaved by barbaric feudalism, and those who now intend to give a small group of Tibetan feudal lords international protection are fanatically supporting the most brutal and barbaric acts of the Middle Ages.
　　The commentary also said that the supporters of the anti-China movement want to alienate China from Asian countries, drag the latter into the "Cold War," and thus weaken their unity in the struggle against imperialism. However, all attempts by provocateurs will end in a dead end of failure.
　　The commentary in "Slovak Truth" said that putting the so-called "Tibet Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.
　　The commentary pointed out that the United States is manipulating behind the scenes of the proposal. Their purpose in discussing this issue is to once again provoke tensions in international relations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th—Hirano Yoshitaro, Vice Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, met with a reporter from this agency in Hong Kong today after arriving from Guangzhou and strongly condemned the United Nations General Assembly's decision to include the so-called "Tibet Question," which is purely China's internal affair, on the agenda of the General Assembly. He said that this practice is a complete violation of international law and also violates the principles of the "United Nations Charter."
　　Hirano Yoshitaro said: The Tibet issue is purely an internal affair of China. The United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of imperialists, decided to discuss the so-called "Tibet Question" in order to create a legitimate excuse for interfering in China's internal affairs and attempting to hinder the easing of international tensions. He emphasized that this attempt will definitely not succeed.
　　Hirano Yoshitaro said that the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan voted in favor of the United Nations General Assembly discussing the so-called "Tibet Question," proving that it continues to pursue a policy of following the United States. The Japanese people oppose this action by the Kishi Nobusuke government.
　　Hirano Yoshitaro also said: The serf system that existed in Tibet completely disregarded the rights of the Tibetan people. The democratic reforms now being carried out by the Chinese government are fully in line with the demands of the Tibetan people.

　　捷报抨击联大讨论“西藏问题”
    美国在国际关系中制造紧张
    平野义太郎指出联大讨论“西藏问题”违反国际法
    据新华社布拉格14日电　“红色权利报”和“斯洛伐克真理报”今天就联合国大会将讨论所谓“西藏问题”一事发表评论。
    “红色权利报”的评论说，把所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程，只能被认为是带有煽动性目的的肮脏勾当。
    评论着重指出，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，讨论这个问题是同联合国宪章相抵触的。如果提出把“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程的人以援引人权宣言和用关心西藏人民的公民权利和宗教权利的幌子来掩饰他们邪恶的意图的话，那么，他们是虚伪极了。
    评论指出，西藏叛乱分子想要使西藏人民永远地受野蛮的封建主义的奴役，而目前那些打算给一小撮西藏封建领主以国际保护的人，正在狂热地支持中世纪的最残暴和野蛮的行为。
    评论还说，反华运动的支持者想要离间中国和亚洲国家，把后者拖入“冷战”，从而削弱它们在反对帝国主义斗争中的团结。但是，挑拨者的一切企图将在失败的死胡同里告终。
    “斯洛伐克真理报”的评论说，把所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程，是明目张胆地干涉中华人民共和国的内政。
    评论指出，在提案幕后操纵的是美国。它们企图讨论这个问题的目的，是想再度在国际关系方面挑起紧张局势。
    新华社香港14日电　国际民主法律工作者协会副主席、日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎今天从广州到香港后接见本社记者，严厉谴责联合国大会决定把纯属中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程。他说，这种作法是完全违反国际法的，同时也是违反“联合国宪章”的原则的。
    平野义太郎说：西藏问题纯粹是中国的内政问题。联合国大会在帝国主义者操纵下决定讨论所谓“西藏问题”，是为了给干涉中国内政制造合法借口，并企图阻碍国际紧张局势的缓和。他强调说，这种企图肯定地是不能成功的。
    平野义太郎说，日本岸信介政府投票赞成联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”，证明它继续执行追随美国的政策。日本人民是反对岸信介政府这种行动的。
    平野义太郎还说：西藏所存在的农奴制度完全漠视了西藏人民权利。现在中国政府所进行的民主改革是完全符合西藏人民的要求的。
