　　Removing Wei Yan's Rebellious Bone
　　Liu Di
    Anyone who has read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" knows about Wei Yan. Although Wei Yan is not a major figure in the "Three Kingdoms," he leaves a deep impression on people because he has a "rebellious bone" on the back of his head, making him a typical wavering element.
    Wei Yan's story is very interesting. If you check his file, you'll find that Wei Yan was originally a subordinate of Liu Cong. When Liu Bei passed through Xiangyang, he killed the gatekeeper soldiers, opened the city gate, and lowered the drawbridge, attempting to join Liu Bei. As a result, he failed to join Liu Bei and was instead defeated by General Wen聘, ruining his reputation and forcing him to defect to Han Xuan, the governor of Changsha. Later, when Guan Yu attacked Changsha, Wei Yan killed Han Xuan, took his head, led the people out of the city, and surrendered to Guan Yu. Although Wei Yan had contributed to the attack on Changsha, Zhuge Liang did not like this character. Upon seeing him, he ordered the executioners to take him out and behead him. Zhuge Liang said, "To kill one's lord while eating his salary is disloyalty; to offer one's land while living on it is injustice. I observe that Wei Yan has a rebellious bone on the back of his head, and he will surely rebel in the future, so I will execute him first to eliminate the root of the trouble." Because Liu Bei pleaded earnestly, he was spared his life, and asked to serve the country loyally and not to have any other intentions. However, later, the rebellious bone on the back of Wei Yan's head often acted up. He relied on his merits, harbored dissatisfaction, often caused disunity with others, and seized every opportunity to compete for fame and profit. In the battle of Luo城, he even fought with old Huang Zhong for credit. Wei Yan always felt that he was exceptionally skilled and disregarded laws and discipline, but whenever he disobeyed military orders, he always suffered losses. Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei were quite patient with some of Wei Yan's mistakes, but Wei Yan made mistakes again and again. Later, when Zhuge Liang died and Sima Yi's army pursued them, at a difficult time, Wei Yan rebelled. It was still Zhuge Liang who was so powerful. Before he died, he had "prearranged a brocade bag plan" to have Yang Yi, Ma Dai, and others prevent Wei Yan's rebellion, thus averting a disaster.
    Although the story is simple, it is thought-provoking. There is no need to study the era in which Wei Yan lived and whether his loyalty or disloyalty was beneficial or harmful to the people. However, whenever Wei Yan is mentioned, one cannot help but think of those wavering people in our revolutionary ranks. Although they are not related to Wei Yan of the Three Kingdoms, they also have one thing in common, that is, they have a "rebellious bone" on the back of their heads.
    It is not surprising that there are people in the revolutionary ranks with "rebellious bones" on the back of their heads. Because in our ranks, in addition to the most steadfast class - the working class - and the strong ally, the peasants, there are also some people from the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Among them, some have resolutely betrayed their class, thoroughly transformed the bourgeois ideas in their minds, and firmly stood on the side of the working class, they are Marxists; others are the opposite, although they also appear as revolutionaries, in essence, the bourgeois ideas in their minds have not been thoroughly transformed, and many old and turbid things are hidden and deeply rooted. Isn't this serious bourgeois ideology a kind of "rebellious bone" for the revolution? With serious bourgeois ideas lurking in the mind, it is naturally impossible to have lofty revolutionary beliefs and a firm revolutionary stand. They are outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed to the Party, and have ulterior motives. Their attitude towards the revolution is not firm or thorough; they follow the revolution if it suits their wishes; if they cannot get what they want, and encounter difficulties and setbacks, they, like Wei Yan, "open the city gates and lower the drawbridges" and turn to the bourgeoisie. Naturally, their "rebellious bones" may not reach the level of "killing their lord and offering their land" like Wei Yan, but they often cause some damage to the revolution.
    Look, aren't the "rebellious bones" on the back of some right-leaning opportunists causing trouble? Although some of them resolutely opposed imperialism and made contributions in the revolutionary struggle, they wavered during the period of socialist construction. They described last year's Great Leap Forward as a complete mess, and used all kinds of sophistry to oppose the general line, attempting to shake the Party's leadership. The bourgeois stuff in their minds has been exposed, and horns are about to grow on their rebellious bones.
    This kind of "rebellious bone" must naturally be removed. Zhuge Liang's way of dealing with Wei Yan's "rebellious bone" was to chop it off once and for all. Our approach to these right-leaning opportunists' "rebellious bones" is to perform surgery, help them remove their "rebellious bones", and treat the illness to save the person. And those with "rebellious bones" on the back of their heads should also consciously uproot this kind of "rebellious bone" brought from the bourgeois womb and establish a firm proletarian revolutionary world view.

### 除掉魏延的反骨

　　除掉魏延的反骨
　　柳笛
    读过“三国演义”的人都知道魏延。魏延虽然不是“三国”中的什么风云人物，可是人们对他的印象很深刻，因为他的脑后有一根“反骨”，是个典型的不坚定分子。
    魏延的故事很有意思。查一查他的档案就知道，魏延原来是刘琮的部下，刘备经过襄阳时，他砍死守门将士，开了城门，放下吊桥，企图投靠刘备。结果，没有投靠上刘备，反而挨了大将文聘一场厮杀，弄得兵败名劣，投到长沙太守韩玄那里去了。后来，关云长攻打长沙，魏延又杀了韩玄，提头上马，引百姓出城，投拜了关云长。魏延虽然对攻打长沙有功，可是诸葛亮并不喜欢这个人物，他一见之下就喝令刀斧手推出去斩了。诸葛亮说：“食其禄而杀其主，是不忠也；居其土而献其地，是不义也。吾观魏延脑后有反骨，久后必反，故先斩之，以绝祸根。”因为刘备苦苦讲情，才饶了他的性命，要他尽忠报国，勿生异心。但是，以后魏延脑袋后面那根反骨常常作怪，他自恃功高，心怀不满，经常和别人闹不团结，而且一有机会就争名夺利。雒城一战，他竟然和老黄忠争起功来了。魏延总觉得自己本领过人，目无法纪，可是每逢他不听军令的时候，总要损兵折将。对于魏延的一些过失，诸葛亮和刘备可算是够耐心的了，但是，魏延一错再错，到后来诸葛亮一死，司马懿的大军追来，正在困难的时候，魏延就反叛了。还是那诸葛亮神通广大，他死前“预伏锦囊计”叫杨仪、马岱等预防魏延的叛乱，才免除了一场祸害。
    故事虽然简单，却很能引人深思。对于魏延所处的时代以及他忠与不忠，对人民有什么利弊，这些都用不着去研究了。但是每逢提到魏延，就使人不免想起我们革命队伍中那些动摇不定的人。他们和三国时的魏延虽不沾亲带故，但也有一个共同之处，就是脑后有一根“反骨”。
    在革命的队伍中，竟然有人脑后长着“反骨”，这并不足为奇。因为我们的队伍里，除了最坚定的阶级——工人阶级的队伍和坚强的同盟军农民以外，还有一些资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的人。其中，有的人坚决背叛了自己的阶级，彻底改造了头脑中的资产阶级思想，坚定地站到工人阶级这方面来了，他们是马克思主义者；有的人却相反，他们虽然也以革命者的面貌出现，可是实质上头脑里的资产阶级思想没有得到彻底改造，许多旧的污浊的东西被隐藏起来，而且长得根深蒂固。这种严重的资产阶级思想意识，对革命不就是一种“反骨”吗？脑子里潜藏着严重的资产阶级思想，自然就不可能有崇高的革命信念，不可能有坚定的革命立场。他们和党貌合神离，存有二心，对待革命的态度是不坚决、不彻底的；革命符合自己的愿望，就跟着革命走；如果不能称心如意，一遇困难和挫折，他们就和魏延一样“开了城门、放下吊桥”投向资产阶级方面去了。自然，他们的“反骨”不可能达到像魏延一样“杀其主，献其地”的程度，可是却常常给革命带来一些损害。
    请看，有些右倾机会主义分子脑后的“反骨”不是在兴妖作怪吗？他们有的人虽然也坚决反对过帝国主义，在革命战斗中有过功绩，可是他们在社会主义建设时期动摇起来了，他们把去年的大跃进说成一团糟，用各种巧言花语反对总路线，企图动摇党的领导。他们脑子里的资产阶级货色暴露出来了，反骨上都要生出角来了。
    这种“反骨”，自然要除掉。诸葛亮对待魏延的“反骨”是想一斩了之。我们对这些右倾机会主义者的“反骨”，是要动动外科手术，帮助他们除掉“反骨”，治病救人。而那些脑后长着“反骨”的人，也应该自觉地把这种从资产阶级娘胎里带来的“反骨”连根拔掉，树立坚定的无产阶级革命世界观。
