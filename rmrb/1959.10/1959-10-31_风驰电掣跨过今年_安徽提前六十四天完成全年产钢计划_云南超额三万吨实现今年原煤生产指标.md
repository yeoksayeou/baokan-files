Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th -- Good news comes from the steel industry front in Anhui Province: As of the 28th, the province has already completed and exceeded its annual steel production task ahead of schedule.

The reason Anhui Province was able to complete its annual steel production task ahead of schedule is due to the rapid, efficient, and economical construction of a large number of steel-making converters. Up to now, the province has built forty-two converters this year, of which thirty-six have been put into operation one after another. After these converters were put into operation, not only did the province's steel production increase rapidly, but the quality of the steel was also very good.

Anhui's early completion of its annual steel production task is the result of continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging vigor, and conducting in-depth socialist education. Inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, steelworkers in various places actively criticized right-leaning conservative ideas, and their labor enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. At the same time, Party committee secretaries at all levels in Anhui Province engaged in "experimental plots." The vast number of cadres moved their bedding to the front of the furnace, shared weal and woe with the workers, took the lead in studying technology, helped steel plants establish post responsibility systems, and promoted advanced experience, thereby enabling many key problems in production to be solved in a timely manner.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th -- Yunnan Province has completed its original coal production plan for this year seventy days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 30,000 tons. Coal production increased by 12% compared to the whole of last year, and by 96.5% compared to the same period last year, equivalent to 142% of the total output during the First Five-Year Plan, and equal to the total output in the seventy-eight years before the liberation of Yunnan.

The foundation of Yunnan Province's coal industry was relatively weak. Since the beginning of this year, while carrying out indigenous production methods, technical improvements have been made to existing mines, and some mechanized and semi-mechanized mines have been gradually constructed, ensuring the continuous improvement of original coal production levels and coal quality. The province has also built seventeen small power plants to serve coal mine production.

From the beginning of the year, employees of key coal mines participated in the competition movement of the province's five systems: steel, coal, machinery, transportation, and electricity. In the nine months plus of this year, the task was exceeded in eight months. The publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further inspired the fighting spirit of coal miners, and many units exceeded the leap forward targets every day.

### 风驰电掣跨过今年  安徽提前六十四天完成全年产钢计划  云南超额三万吨实现今年原煤生产指标

    风驰电掣跨过今年
    安徽提前六十四天完成全年产钢计划
    云南超额三万吨实现今年原煤生产指标
    据新华社合肥30日电  安徽省钢铁工业战线上传出捷报：到28日止，全省已提前超额完成了全年的产钢任务。
    安徽省所以能提前完成了全年的产钢任务，是由于多快好省地建成了一大批炼钢转炉。到目前为止，全省在今年已建成转炉四十二座，其中的三十六座已陆续投入生产。这批转炉投入生产以后，不仅使全省钢产量迅速上升，而且钢的质量也很好。
    安徽提前完成全年产钢任务，是不断反右倾、鼓干劲和深入进行社会主义教育的结果。各地炼钢工人在党的八届八中全会的公报和决议的鼓舞下，积极批判右倾保守思想，劳动热情空前高涨。同时，安徽省各级党委书记都搞了“试验田”。广大干部纷纷把铺盖搬到炉前，跟工人同甘共苦，带头钻研技术，帮助炼钢厂建立岗位责任制，推广先进经验，进一步开展技术革新运动，因而使生产上的许多关键问题都得到及时解决。
  据新华社昆明24日电　云南省提前七十天超额三万吨完成今年原煤生产计划。煤产量比去年全年增长12％，比去年同期增长96.5％，等于第一个五年计划产量总和142％，等于云南解放前七十八年产量总和。
    云南省煤炭工业的底子是比较薄弱的。今年以来，在进行土法生产的同时，对现有矿井进行了技术改造，并逐步建设了一些机械化、半机械化的矿井，保证了原煤生产水平和煤质的不断提高。全省还建设了为煤矿生产服务的小型电厂十七个。
    从年初起，重点煤矿的职工就参加了全省钢铁、煤炭、机械、交通运输、电力五个系统的竞赛运动。今年九个多月来，就有八个月超额完成任务。党的八届八中全会公报、决议的公布，更加鼓舞了煤矿职工的斗志，许多单位天天都超额完成了跃进指标。
