Xinjiang Rushes Wheat Planting, Progress Exceeds Last Year

Urumqi, October 15th (By our reporter) – The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has planted more winter wheat this year, and at a faster pace and better quality. According to incomplete statistics as of early October, the region has sown over 8.4 million mu of winter wheat, completing more than 75% of the sowing plan, which is more than 3 million mu more than the same period last year. The northern Xinjiang areas, such as Changji, Bayingolin Autonomous Prefecture, Tacheng Special District, and directly subordinate counties and cities of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, where the climate is colder and plowing started earlier, have overfulfilled their winter wheat sowing plans. The region's sowing area will be expanded by more than 2 million mu compared to last year.

This year, the characteristics of winter wheat sowing by the people's communes are: sufficient preparation, timely sowing, fast progress, and significantly improved quality compared to previous years. All regions have implemented reasonable close planting according to local conditions; basically achieved the use of improved wheat varieties; and the quality of base fertilizer has generally improved further compared to last year.

The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party has greatly encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of the members of all ethnic groups. A competitive upsurge of catching up with each other has been set off in the sowing process in various places. Many communes have divided manpower and animal power into two shifts, day and night, replacing people and animals but not tools, and rushing to plant day and night, and new records of breaking quotas are constantly being reported everywhere. In order to complete the sowing work in a timely manner, many communes organized members to eat in the fields, seizing grain from time. In Shule County, a total of 190 canteens in various people's communes, 159 were moved to the fields during the sowing period to ensure that members were well-fed and saved time. During the sowing period, each production team reasonably organized the labor force and implemented the "three guarantees" and assembly line operation methods, such as contracting work, quality, and quantity, to ensure the quality of sowing.

At present, the early-sown winter wheat in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains has generally emerged. According to the seedling emergence situation, the seedlings are generally uniform and strong, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges has been greatly reduced compared with previous years. Efforts are being made to reduce the three types of seedlings, and at the end of the autumn harvest, members have been organized to check the seedlings, replant seedlings, and manage the seedling stage, striving to make all wheat fields have uniform, strong, and safe overwintering seedlings, and reverse the slow phenomenon of eliminating the three types of seedlings only when the winter wheat turns green in the past.

　　新疆突击种麦进度超过去年
    本报乌鲁木齐15日电　新疆维吾尔自治区今年冬小麦种的又多、又快、又好。截至10月初不完全的统计，全区已播种冬麦八百四十多万亩，完成了播种计划的75％以上，比去年同期多播了三百多万亩。气候较冷，开犁较早的昌吉、巴音郭楞自治州、塔城专区、伊犁哈萨克族自治州直属县、市等北疆地区，已超额完成了冬麦播种计划。全区播种面积将比去年扩大二百多万亩。
    今年，各人民公社播种冬麦的特点是：准备工作充分、播种适时、进度快、质量比往年大大提高。各地都因地制宜作到了合理密植；基本上实现了小麦良种化；基肥质量也普遍较去年进一步有了提高。
    党的八中全会的决议，更大大鼓舞了各族社员的冲天干劲，各地在播种中都掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮，许多公社都把人畜力分为日夜两班，换人换畜不换工具，日夜突击抢种，到处都不断传出了突破定额的新纪录。许多公社为了适时完成播种工作；都组织社员吃在地里，和时间争粮。疏勒县各人民公社共有一百九十个食堂，播种期间就有一百五十九个搬到地头，保证社员吃饱、吃好又节约了时间。各生产队在播种期间，合理组织了劳动力，推行了三包和流水作业法等包工、包质、包量等制度，保证了播种质量。
    目前，天山南北播种早的冬麦已普遍出苗，根据出苗情况看，一般苗齐、苗壮，缺苗、断垅现象比往年大大减少。设法减少三类苗，并在秋收基本结束时已组织社员进行查苗、补苗和苗期的管理工作，力争全部麦田苗齐、苗壮、安全越冬，扭转已往在冬麦返青时才开始消灭三类苗的迟缓现象。（丁文）
