　　Being Both Competitive Opponents and Cooperative Comrades
    Kaishantun and Shixian Paper Mills Join Hands to Leap Forward
    (Our report) This year, the Kaishantun Paper Mill and the Shixian Paper Mill in Jilin Province, which competed with each other and jointly leapt forward last year, have once again launched a "one-on-one" competition. Because the competition has developed from the factory level to the team level, with each person and level having a counterpart, learning from each other and drawing on each other's strengths, the two factories have achieved great results in the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    In March of this year, the two factories signed a comprehensive competition agreement for "high yield, high quality, and low consumption," launching a "one-on-one" competition comparing targets, enthusiasm, management, and collaboration. Participants in this competition included factory-level leading cadres, office staff, and cadres and workers from each workshop, section, and type of work. The two factories regularly take turns inspecting and evaluating each other. This type of inspection and evaluation is suitable for studying and solving major key issues that exist in common, and also for learning some small experiences that have a great impact on production from each other. In early May, the Party Secretary of Shixian Paper Mill led more than 50 employees to Kaishantun Paper Mill to inspect and evaluate the implementation of the competition in April; they did not just sit in the office to calculate the completion of targets, but mainly went to the workshops, sections, and teams to work shifts according to the business of the inspectors and evaluators; they not only inspected each other's work in the production process, but more importantly, learned from each other's experience on the spot. In just three days, they learned more than 50 advanced experiences; at the same time, they also put forward many suggestions to Kaishantun Paper Mill and spread their experience. Many of these experiences are extremely necessary for solving current production problems. For example, the paper-making workshop of Shixian Paper Mill learned from the experience of Kaishantun Paper Mill that the breast roll of the Fourdrinier paper machine does not need a scraper, and implemented measures to periodically scrape the surface of the suction box, which doubled the life of the copper wire, changing the problem that the copper wire had not been able to meet the quota for a long time. According to calculations, reducing copper wire consumption and the number of wire changes alone can increase production by more than 120,000 yuan per year. In June, Kaishantun Paper Mill learned more than 70 experiences from Shixian Paper Mill, and put forward more than 50 suggestions to Shixian Paper Mill and spread experience. According to the experience of Shixian Paper Mill, Kaishantun Paper Mill changed the closed beating to open continuous beating, and the uniformity of wood pulp fiber increased by 20%, and the beating efficiency was also higher than before. Since the two factories started the competition this year, they have exchanged and learned a total of more than 350 various advanced experiences.
    In the mutual competition, the employees of the two factories are like one factory, caring about each other's production, and showing a noble style of sincere cooperation. Responding to every request and arriving to every invitation, sharing what one has with the other, has become the action slogan of the employees of the two factories. On July 28, the pulp workshop of Shixian Paper Mill overhauled the No. 1 digester, and suddenly found that there was something wrong with the pulp discharge door. It was not repaired within the scheduled overhaul time, and the factory had no spare parts. Seeing that it would affect production, Kaishantun Paper Mill learned of this and sent the only spare part by car that night. Not long ago, Kaishantun Paper Mill's pharmaceutical capacity was not enough, forcing the total acid concentration to drop, which seriously threatened production. Shixian Paper Mill immediately sent a workshop director to lead three experienced foremen to help study how to improve pharmaceutical capacity and stabilize the total acid concentration. They worked in Kaishantun Paper Mill for seven days to more than half a month, and did not all return to the factory until the total acid concentration improved.
    This type of one-on-one competition has greatly improved the production level of the two factories. Shixian Paper Mill completed the paper-making plan for the third quarter five days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 5%, and the wood pulp completed the plan three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 3%. In September, it created the highest record of 100% first-class wood pulp products, and the comparable cost in September was 9.35% lower than the plan. The total output value of Kaishantun Paper Mill in September increased by 36.4% compared with August, the output of wood pulp increased by 20.9% compared with August, the output of paper in the third quarter increased by 90% compared with the same period last year, and the amount of pulp used per ton of paper was reduced by about 3% compared with the average last year, maintaining the most advanced level in the country.
    Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, the movement to increase production and practice economy in the two factories has become more in-depth and vigorous. Shixian Paper Mill guarantees to complete the annual plan for various papers 15 to 20 days ahead of schedule. The paper output of Kaishantun Paper Mill on October 1 created the highest record in history: 61 tons. These two factories are using greater efforts and better cooperation to fight again in the fourth quarter. (Cai Ming)

### 是竞赛的对手又是互助的战友  开山屯石岘纸厂携手跃进

　　是竞赛的对手又是互助的战友
    开山屯石岘纸厂携手跃进
    本报讯　去年相互竞赛共同跃进的吉林省开山屯造纸厂和石岘造纸厂，今年来又“兵对兵、将对将”地展开了“对口”竞赛。由于竞赛从厂部发展到小组，逐人逐级都有对手，互相学习，取长补短，使两厂的增产节约运动取得了巨大成绩。
    今年3月份，这两厂签订了“丰产、优质、低耗”的全面竞赛协议，展开了比指标、比干劲、比管理、比协作的“对口”竞赛。参加这次竞赛的包括厂级领导干部、科室人员，各车间、各工段、各工种的干部和工人。两厂之间定期轮流检查评比。这种检查评比，既适宜研究解决共同存在的重大关键问题，也能够相互学习到一些细小的对生产有很大作用的经验。石岘造纸厂党委书记5月初率领五十多名职工到开山屯造纸厂检查评比4月份竞赛执行情况；他们不是仅坐在办公室里计算指标完成情况，主要是按检查评比人员的业务，分头下车间、工段、小组跟班劳动；不仅在生产过程中检查对方的工作，更重要的是现场学习对方的经验。仅三天的时间他们就学习了五十多项先进经验；同时，也向开山屯造纸厂提出许多建议和传播了他们的经验。其中许多经验是解决当前生产问题极需要的。如石岘厂造纸车间学习了开山屯厂长网抄纸机胸辊不用刮刀的经验，实行定期刮平吸引箱表面的措施，铜网寿命延长了一倍多，改变了长期以来铜网达不到定额的问题。据计算，仅减少铜网消耗和换网次数，全年即可增产十二万多元。6月份，开山屯造纸厂向石岘造纸厂学习了七十多条经验，并向石岘厂提出建议和传播经验五十多条。开山屯厂根据石岘厂的经验，将密闭打浆改为开放连续打浆，木浆纤维均整度，提高了20％，打浆效率也比原来提高了。两厂今年开展竞赛以来，总共交流学习了各种先进经验三百五十多条。
    在相互竞赛中，两厂职工就像一个工厂一样，互相关心对方的生产，表现了真诚协作的高尚风格。有求必应，有请必到，互通有无，成了两厂职工的行动口号。7月28日，石岘厂化浆车间检修一号蒸煮锅，忽然发现放浆大门出了毛病，在预定检修时间之内没有修好，厂里没有备品，眼看着就要影响生产，开山屯厂得知后，当夜就用汽车把仅有的一件备品给送来了。不久前，开山屯厂制药能力不够，迫使总酸浓度下降，严重地威胁着生产。石岘厂便立即派了一名车间主任带领三个有经验的工长去帮助研究提高制药能力和稳定总酸浓度，他们分别在开山屯厂工作了七天到半个多月，一直等到总酸浓度好转才全部回厂。
    这种对口竞赛，使两个厂的生产水平大大提高。石岘造纸厂第三季度提前五天超额5％完成了造纸计划，木浆提前三天超额3％完成了计划，9月份创造了木浆百分之百一级品的最高纪录，9月份的可比成本比计划降低了9.35％。开山屯造纸厂9月份总产值比8月份提高了36.4％，木浆产量比8月份提高了20.9％，纸产量第三季度比去年同期增长90％，每吨纸的用浆量又比去年平均降低了3％左右，始终保持全国最先进水平。
    第四季度开始，两厂的增产节约运动更加深入高涨。石岘造纸厂保证各种纸提前十五天争取二十天完成全年计划。开山屯造纸厂10月1日的纸产量创造了有史以来的最高纪录：六十一吨。这两个厂正在用更大的干劲，更好的协作，再战第四季度。　（蔡明）
