    To prepare conditions for a Great Leap Forward in agriculture this winter and next spring
    Mass scientific research in Hebei is unusually active
    (Our report) The Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association of Hebei Province are organizing, in coordination with the large-scale water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and winter wheat management work for agricultural production this winter, to mobilize the masses to prepare conditions for the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.
    In terms of gradually mechanizing agriculture and promoting new-style farm tools, a new high tide of mass movement to reform old tools and create new tools is being set off. At present, many inventions have emerged in tool reform across various regions, mainly including wheat management tools, harvesting tools, water lifting and irrigation tools, transportation tools, as well as tilling, manure mashing, and rice transplanting tools. Some have been assessed and have good results. For example, Cangxian County created fifty-four types of tools in the first quarter. After assessment, thirty-one types were selected, and more than 140,000 pieces were manufactured and promoted. Twenty-eight counties across the province have trial-produced wheat harvesters and threshers, producing 246 harvester samples and 145 threshers in the first quarter. In September, the Provincial Tool Reform Committee and the Provincial Science and Technology Commission held a provincial tool reform on-site meeting in Shenxian County to exchange leadership experience in tool reform work. At the same time, a batch of newly reformed tools was assessed. The Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association have adhered to the spirit of combining popularization and improvement in the inventions and creations of the broad masses. As long as they can improve labor productivity, reduce labor intensity, the materials are easy to solve, and the use of technology is simple, they are strongly supported. On the other hand, the Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association at all levels continuously strengthen scientific and technological information work and technical appraisal work. New tools with universal significance are vigorously organized for promotion after appraisal and experimentation. Creative inventions with directional significance are also supported in terms of technology and material conditions.
    In order to achieve the goal of applying 5,000 catties of fertilizer per mu throughout the province, the Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association of Hebei Province are organizing the masses to trial-produce and produce local chemical fertilizers and local bacterial fertilizers in combination with local resource conditions, to supplement the shortage of farm manure and foreign chemical fertilizers; the results of mass research and trial production are promptly assessed.
    According to the summary of technical investigations on planting wheat and autumn crops in Hebei Province this year, the Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Association organized professional meetings to study how to further implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. This year, under the requirement of extensive planting, high yields, and overall production increase, many large-area high-yield plots and high-yield experimental fields have been planned and cultivated. Many communes and production teams have generally established wheat intelligence points and established field record systems. With the Eight-Point Charter as the center, various wheat comparison experimental fields have been planted. The Science and Technology Association and local research institutions organized several provincial technical investigations in the first half of the year according to different growth stages of wheat, and also organized technical investigations on cotton, corn, millet, peanuts, etc. In these activities, a large amount of data has been accumulated, and some projects have been summarized. This winter, they are also preparing to hold the annual meeting of the Agricultural Society, to conduct scientific and technological summaries in batches and by specialty, in order to guide spring planting in a timely manner and prepare conditions for a greater harvest next year.

    为今冬明春农业大跃进准备条件
    河北群众性科学研究异常活跃
    本报讯　河北省科学技术委员会、科学技术协会组织，配合今冬农业生产的大搞水利、积肥、土壤改良和小麦越冬管理工作，发动群众为农业生产的大跃进准备条件。
    在配合农业逐步机械化和推广新式农具方面，正在掀起一个改革旧工具、创造新工具的群众运动的新高潮。目前在工具改革中，各地出现了不少的创造发明，主要有小麦管理工具、收获工具、提水排灌工具、运输工具，以及整地、捣粪和水稻插秧工具。有的经过鉴定，效果良好。如沧县在第一季度创造了五十四种工具，经过鉴定，选出三十一种，制造推广了十四万多件。全省有二十八个县试制了小麦收割机、脱粒机，在第一季度就制出收割机样品二百四十六台，脱粒机一百四十五台。9月份，省工具改革委员会、省科委又在深县召开了全省工具改革现场会，交流了工具改革工作的领导经验，同时，鉴定了一批新改革的工具。科委、科协对广大群众的发明创造，坚持了普及和提高相结合的精神，只要能提高劳动生产率，减低劳动强度，材料容易解决，使用技术简单的，就大力支持；另方面，各级科委、科协不断加强科学技术情报工作和技术鉴定工作，对具有普遍意义的新工具，经过鉴定试验，大力组织推广，对带有方向性的创造发明，还从技术、物质条件方面给予支持。
    为实现全省每亩施肥五千斤的要求，河北省科委、科协组织结合各地的资源条件，发动群众进行试制和生产土化肥、土菌肥，以此来补充农家肥和洋化肥的不足；对群众研究试制成果，及时进行鉴定。
   根据河北省今年关于种植小麦和大秋作物技术考察总结，科委和科协组织分别召开专业会议，研究如何进一步贯彻农业八字宪法。今年各地在广种多收全面增产的要求下，已有计划地培养了很多大面积丰产方和高产试验田，不少公社和生产队普遍设立了小麦情报点，建立了田间档案制，并以八字宪法为中心，种植了各式各样的小麦对比试验田。科协和地方研究机构，在上半年曾按照小麦不同生长阶段，组织了多次全省性的技术考察，对棉花、玉米、谷子、花生等也组织了技术考察。在这些活动中，都积累了大量资料，有的项目已作出了总结。今年冬季，他们还准备召开农学会年会，分批分专业地进行科学技术总结，以便及时指导春播，为明年的更大丰收准备条件。（附图片）
