To the Utmost to Intensify the Tense Situation
    The United States Intensifies the Establishment of Missile Bases Abroad
    And Plans Multiple Missile Tests on Okinawa
    This newspaper reports that the United States is accelerating the construction of missile bases and conducting missile tests in many regions of Europe and Asia, and is doing its utmost to prevent the international situation from easing. According to recent reports in the Western press, the United States and Turkey have reached an agreement on the establishment of missile bases in Turkey. This will be the third North Atlantic Treaty Organization country in which the United States has built medium-range missile bases. The other two countries are the United Kingdom and Italy. In addition, the issue of the United States building missile bases in Greece is also under intense negotiation. U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Irwin announced that before the end of this year, the United States will send thirty-nine missile squadrons to U.S. missile bases in Europe.
    According to the "New York Times" on the 11th, the negotiations between the United States and Turkey on the construction of missile bases were held at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Supreme Headquarters in Paris, commanded by Norstad. The United States and Turkey will formally exchange documents on this agreement. The United States will equip its bases in Turkey with the Air Force's prototype "Thor" missiles and the Army's prototype "Jupiter" missiles. The "New York Times" boasted in a blatant war-mongering tone that "from Turkish bases, these missiles can hit any stronghold in the European part of the Soviet Union and most of Central Asia."
    At the same time, Booth, the commander of the U.S. military's 9th Corps stationed in Okinawa, announced that the U.S. military will conduct twenty-four missile tests in central Okinawa from the end of October to the end of December. This is the first time since the United States turned Okinawa into a nuclear weapons base that it has officially announced missile tests on the island. According to Japan Broadcasting Corporation radio quoting "well-informed sources," the United States may invite Chiang Kai-shek's group and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "military experts" to participate in these tests. Kyodo News Agency commented on the news of the agreement between the United States and Turkey on missile bases on the 12th, saying that this action by the United States is "pouring cold water on the trend of easing tensions." This news has attracted the "attention" of "Washington diplomatic circles." Kyodo News Agency's commentary also revealed the awkward situation of the U.S. authorities. It said that "it is rumored that within the U.S. government," there is "a divergence of opinion" on whether to announce the agreement between the United States and Turkey. Some people advocate that regardless of the trend of easing the international situation, the United States should continue to openly poison the international atmosphere. Most people are worried that the U.S. announcement of this agreement will give people "a strong impression that the United States is unilaterally obstructing disarmament efforts." The commentator of this news agency believes that no matter what methods the United States adopts, "the essence of the U.S.-Turkey agreement will not be affected."

### 极尽加剧紧张局势之能事  美国加紧在国外建立导弹基地  并策划在冲绳岛进行多次导弹试验

　　极尽加剧紧张局势之能事
    美国加紧在国外建立导弹基地
    并策划在冲绳岛进行多次导弹试验
    本报讯　美国正在欧洲和亚洲许多地区加紧修建导弹基地和进行导弹试验，极力阻挠国际局势趋向缓和。据西方报刊最近报道，美国和土耳其关于在土耳其建立导弹基地的谈判已经达成协议。这将是美国在第三个北大西洋集团国家修建中程导弹基地。其余二个国家，一个是英国，另一个是意大利。此外，美国在希腊建筑导弹基地问题，目前也在紧张进行谈判中。美国国防部助理部长欧文宣布，在今年年底以前，美国将派出三十九个导弹中队前往欧洲的美国导弹基地。
    据11日的“纽约时报”报道，美国和土耳其关于建筑导弹基地的谈判是在巴黎的北大西洋集团最高司令诺斯塔德总部举行的。美国和土耳其将正式就这项协议交换文件。美国将以空军试制的“雷神式”导弹和陆军试制的“丘辟特式”导弹装备它在土耳其的基地。“纽约时报”以露骨的好战口吻吹嘘说“从土耳其基地，这种导弹能够射到苏联欧洲部分和中亚大部分地区的任何据点”。
    与此同时，驻在冲绳岛的美军第九兵团司令布斯宣布，美军将从10月底到12月底在冲绳中部进行二十四次导弹试验。这是美国把冲绳岛变成核武器基地以来，第一次正式宣布在岛上举行导弹试验。据日本广播协会电台引“消息灵通人士”的话透露，在进行这些试验时，美国可能邀请蒋介石集团和东南亚条约组织“军事专家”参加。共同社12日在评论美、土关于导弹基地谈判达成协议的消息时说，美国这一行动是“对缓和紧张局势的趋向泼冷水”。这一消息已经引起了“华盛顿外交界人士”的“注意”。共同社评论中还透露了美国当局的狼狈处境。它说，“据传，在美国政府内部”，对是否要公布美、土谈判达成协议消息问题存在“意见上的对立”。一部分人主张不管国际局势趋向缓和，美国应当继续公开地毒化国际气氛。大部分人则担心美国公布这个协议将使人们获得“强烈的关于美国单方面阻挠裁军努力的印象”。这家通讯社的评论作者认为，不管美国采取什么手法，“对美土协定的实质并不会有所影响”。
