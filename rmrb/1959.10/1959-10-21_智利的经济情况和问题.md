    The Economic Situation and Problems of Chile
    Chile, Mas Nofou
    Chile is a country located at the southwestern end of South America, covering an area of 286,000 square miles, of which more than 30% is mountainous and barren land, unsuitable for cultivation but rich in mineral deposits. The population is approximately 7.3 million.

    Compared to China, China is about twelve times larger in area and more than eighty-eight times larger in population than Chile.

    Chile's economic structure consists of industry, agriculture, and mining. Currently, handicrafts play a major role in economic activities, accounting for 20% of the nation's total production value. Agriculture accounts for 15%, and mining accounts for 8%. The output value of handicrafts, agriculture, and mining accounts for 43% of the total national income. The remaining 57% is income from service industries, referring to commercial, transportation, banking, and other service industries, public service industries, and government-run service industries.

    An economic structure where the income of service industries exceeds the income of industrial and agricultural production should be the economic structure of a highly developed country in the capitalist economic system. However, this is not the case with Chile. Although Chile is much more developed than other countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, it can be said that Chile is still an underdeveloped country. The dominant share of income from service industries is one of the important problems of the Chilean economy. The reason for this situation is Chile's unemployment problem; the Chilean economic system cannot solve the employment problem for the 65,000 young people who reach working age each year.

    Chile's population is growing rapidly, increasing by 2.5% annually. This exacerbates Chile's economic problems. Each year, the population increases by 180,000 new people, who need food and all the material necessities of modern life.

    Another important feature of the Chilean economy is its slow economic development. In recent years, the growth rate of the national total production value has almost been equal to the population growth rate. This means that the living standards of residents have not improved. In other Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, the total production value has increased by more than 6% annually in recent years.

    Since the People's Front government came to power in 1938, Chile's industry has greatly developed and laid the foundation for industrialization. The national electrification plan, the establishment of the ferrous metallurgy industry, and the exploitation of oil are the decisive factors in the growth of light industry production. Without the direct management of the government, Chile would not have been able to carry out the above-mentioned infrastructure construction. Private economy has never had and could not have such large-scale development. Currently, Chile has 500,000 horsepower of power equipment, an annual steel output of 400,000 tons, and 1 million cubic meters of oil. These infrastructures have created conditions for the rapid development of light industry. Now, 80% of light industrial products on the market are domestically produced, and the net output value of light industry is approximately $1.4 billion annually.

    Chile's industry has made great progress in replacing imports with exports and is now firmly implementing the policy of vigorously increasing the production of export products such as steel, fishery products, timber, paper, celluloid, and chemical industries.

    Agriculture in Chile still has a semi-feudal economic structure in many regions. On the one hand, there are many large landowners, and on the other hand, most farmers occupy very little land. Large landlords leave a large amount of land uncultivated, while ordinary farmers cannot maintain their livelihoods. The operation of these two forms of ownership is extremely uneconomical, and land reform is urgently needed. In recent years, agricultural output has only increased by 1.8% annually, which is lower than the population growth rate. Therefore, Chile's food problem is becoming increasingly serious. Thus, Chile has to resort to food imports to solve the problem, importing almost nearly $100 million worth of food each year.

    In terms of mining, copper production is the most important indicator, reaching 500,000 tons this year. Other important products include sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, iron ore, sulfur, and so on. Copper accounts for 65% of foreign exchange earnings.

    In terms of foreign trade, exports have risen to $450 million and imports have risen to $320 million. 86% of exports are mineral products, with industrial and agricultural products accounting for 7% each. The main imported goods are: raw materials 30%, fuel 10%, means of production 45%, and consumer goods 15%.

    From the above figures, it can be seen that the import of raw materials, which determines the production of light industry, basically relies on the export of mineral products, especially copper. The price of copper is very unstable in the international market, which makes the Chilean economy unstable for a long time, with more declines than rises.

    It should also be particularly pointed out that Chile's market is very small, partly because of Chile's small population and partly because of the low income of the people, which is approximately $300 per year per capita. In this way, the broad masses, such as certain peasant classes, are outside the monetary market because the labor remuneration they receive is only in kind. The distribution of income is also unfair. 7% of entrepreneurs, who constitute the labor population, receive more than 50% of the national income, while 80% of the workers only receive a little more than 20%. Thus, the average income of entrepreneurs is fourteen times higher than that of workers.

    In summary, it can be said that the main problem of the Chilean economy is to achieve rapid economic development and provide jobs and food for the rapidly increasing population.

    In order to achieve the above-mentioned requirements, it is necessary to implement thorough land reform and build large-scale infrastructure projects such as highways, roads, and water conservancy, which are essential conditions for rapid economic development.

    Another increasingly clear problem is the necessity of establishing trade, cultural, and diplomatic relations with socialist countries. The Chilean economy needs to export and expand markets to change its instability.

    This point, which was still much debated in Chile not long ago, has now become a common demand due to American pressure, and as a result, a movement has been formed with the participation of people from different political and cultural circles, demanding the establishment of relations with socialist countries as soon as possible. In this regard, the Chinese market is particularly important to Chile, because any kind of exchange will promote the increase of exports.

    智利的经济情况和问题
    智利　马斯·诺福
    智利是位于南美洲西南端的一个国家，面积达二十八万六千平方英里，其中30％多是山区和不能耕种的、但矿藏丰富的荒地。人口约七百三十多万。
    智利同中国比起来，中国的面积比智利约大十二倍，人口多八十八倍多。
    智利的经济结构是由工业、农业和矿业组成的。目前，手工业在经济活动中占主要地位。手工业占全国生产总值的20％。农业占15％，矿业占8％。手工业、农业、矿业产值占全部国民收入的43％。其余的57％则是服务性行业的收入，这种服务性行业指的是商业、交通运输、银行等服务性行业，公共服务性行业和政府办的服务性行业等。
    服务性行业的收入超过工农业生产的收入的经济结构，在资本主义经济体系来说，应该是高度发达的国家的经济结构。但是，智利并非如此。尽管智利比拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲的其他国家发达得多，但是可以说，智利仍然是一个不发达的国家。服务性行业的收入占优势，是智利经济的重要问题之一。造成这种情况的原因，是智利的失业问题；智利的经济体系无法使每年达到具有劳动力年龄的六万五千名青年的就业问题。
    智利的人口增长速度很快，每年递增2.5％。这使智利的经济问题更加严重。每年增加十八万新人口，这些人要吃饭，要享用一切现代生活所必需的物质生活。
    智利经济的另一重要特征，是经济发展缓慢。最近几年，全国生产总值的增长速度几乎只和人口的增长速度相等。这就是说，居民生活水平一直没有提高。而在拉丁美洲的其他国家，像墨西哥和巴西，最近几年每年生产总值都增长6％以上。
    1938年，人民阵线的政府执政以后，智利的工业有很大的发展，并为工业化奠定了基础。国家电气化计划、黑色冶金工业的建立和石油的开采是使轻工业生产增长的决定因素。没有政府的直接管理，智利是不可能进行上述基本建设的，私人经济从来没有也不可能有这样大规模的发展。目前智利有五十万马力的动力设备，年产钢四十万吨，石油一百万立方米。这些基本建设为轻工业的快速发展创造了条件，现在市场上80％的轻工业品是国产的，轻工业的纯产值约为每年十四亿美元。
    智利工业在用输出代替输入的过程中获得很大进展，现在正坚决地执行大力提高钢铁、渔业、木材、造纸、赛璐珞和化学工业等输出产品的生产方针。
    智利农业在很多地区还是半封建的经济结构，一方面有很多大土地所有者，另一方面大多数农民占有极少的土地。大地主荒废了大量土地不去耕耘，而一般农民却不能维持生活。这两种所有制形式的经营结果极不经济，迫切需要实行土地改革。最近几年农业产量每年才提高1.8％，也就是说低于人口增长率，因此智利的粮食问题也日益严重。这样，智利不得不求助于粮食输入来解决问题，每年几乎输入价值近一亿美元的粮食。
    在矿业方面，铜的生产是最重要的标志，今年达到了五十万吨。其他重要产品有硝酸钠、硝酸钾、铁矿石、硫磺等等。铜占外汇收入的65％。
    在对外贸易方面，输出上升到四亿五千万美元，输入上升到三亿二千万美元。出口的86％是矿产品，工业品和农产品各占7％。进口商品主要是：原料30％，燃料10％，生产资料45％，消费品15％。
    从上述数字中可以看出，决定着轻工业生产的原料的进口基本上依靠矿产品，特别是铜的出口。铜的价格在国际市场上很不稳定，这使得智利经济长期不稳定，下降的情况比高涨要多。
    还应该特别指出，智利的市场非常狭小，这一方面是由于智利的人口少，另一方面也因为人民的收入低，按人口分配差不多是每年三百美元。这样，广大群众，例如某些农民阶层，就处于货币市场之外，因为他们得到的劳动报酬仅仅是实物。收入的分配也是不公平的。占劳动人口的7％的企业主得到国民收入的50％以上，而占80％的工人却只得到20％多一点。这样企业主的平均收入比工人高出十四倍。
    总括起来，可以说智利经济的主要问题是要取得经济的迅速发展，给急速增加的人口提供工作和食品。
    为了实现上面提到的要求，那就必须实行彻底的土地改革，并大规模地兴建像公路、大路、水利等基本工程，而这些建设对于经济的快速发展是必不可少的条件。
    另一个越来越看得清楚的问题，是同社会主义国家建立贸易、文化和外交关系的必要性。智利经济需要输出和扩大市场以改变它的不稳定性。
    这一点，不久前在智利还是争论很多的，现在由于美国的压力已经成了普遍的要求，并由此而形成了一个有不同的政界和文化界人士参加的、要求尽快同社会主义国家建立关系的运动。在这方面，中国的市场对于智利特别重要，因为任何一种交换都会促进输出的增加。
