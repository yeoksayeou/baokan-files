    Indian Troops Invade Tibetan Border, Armed Provocation
    Our Foreign Ministry Lodges Strong Protest with India
    Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: On October 20, 1959, three Indian armed personnel illegally crossed into our territory south of the Kongka Pass in the northwestern end of the Tibet region of China. Our border defense personnel immediately advised them to withdraw from Chinese territory, but they refused. Our border defense personnel then had no choice but to disarm them and detain them. On October 21, more than seventy Indian armed personnel invaded our territory in the same area and even launched an armed provocation against our border defense personnel patrolling the area. They surrounded and approached our patrol force in two directions, attempting to cut off our army's retreat, and fired shots twice. At this time, our army did not return fire, but only gestured for them to go back and not to shoot. The Indian troops not only ignored this, but continued to advance, seized our army's horses, and then opened fire fiercely on our army, launching an attack. Under these circumstances, our patrol force was forced to return fire in self-defense. The two sides exchanged fire for about two hours, suffering casualties on both sides. Several Indian soldiers were captured by us before the Indian troops withdrew from the scene of the incident.
    Regarding the serious provocative incident in which a large number of Indian troops deliberately invaded our border and launched an unprovoked armed attack on our border defense forces, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indian Ambassador to China, Mr. Parthasarathi, on October 22 to deliver a memorandum, lodging a strong protest and demanding that the Indian government immediately take measures to prevent the recurrence of incidents of Indian troops invading our border and provoking our border defense forces.

    印军侵犯西藏边境武装挑衅
    我外交部向印方提出严重抗议 
    新华社23日讯　1959年10月20日有印度武装人员三人非法越入中国西藏地方西北端空喀山口以南的我国领土。我国边防人员当即向他们提出劝告，要他们立即自中国境内退出，但是为他们所拒绝。我边防人员于是不得不将他们解除武装，予以扣押。10月21日，有印度武装人员七十余人又在同一处地方侵入我国境内，并且竟然向巡逻该地的我国边防人员进行武装挑衅。他们分两路包围和逼近我巡逻部队，企图切断我军后路，并且两次开枪射击。此时我军并未还击，仅以手势要他们回去和不要打枪。印军非但不理，而且继续进逼，抢走我军的马匹，随即向我军猛烈开火，发起进攻。在此情况下，我巡逻部队为了自卫，被迫还击。双方互相射击约两小时，各有伤亡，有几名印军被我俘获，印军才撤离肇事地点。
    对于以上大批印度军队蓄意侵犯我国边境并无端向我国边防部队发起武装攻击的严重挑衅事件，我国外交部已于10月22日约见印度驻华大使帕塔萨拉蒂递交备忘录，提出严重抗议，要求印度政府立即采取措施，制止印军侵犯我国边境和向我国边防部队挑衅的事件的再次发生。
