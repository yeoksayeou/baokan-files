    Widespread Bumper Harvests of Various Oil Crops
    Northern Shanxi More Than Self-Sufficient in Oil

    The Jinbei (Northern Shanxi) Special District, Shanxi Province, which has historically been unable to achieve self-sufficiency in oil crops, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of oil crops this year. According to actual yields from already threshed crops and some estimated forecasts, the average yield per mu of oil crops in the entire district has increased by 35% compared to last year. Due to the expansion of planting areas, the total output has increased by more than 60% compared to last year. With the fundamental improvement in oil crop production, this year the entire district will not only achieve self-sufficiency in oil but will also be able to sell some to the state to support other regions.

    All 1,360,000 mu of oil crops, including flax, sunflowers, hemp, yellow mustard, black mustard, and small hemp, have now been harvested in the entire district, with more than half already threshed and stored. Reports of widespread bumper harvests are constantly pouring in from all directions. Yanggao, Hunyuan, Yuanping, Wutai, and other counties have all increased their total oil crop output by about double compared to last year; Xingxian and Hequ counties have both increased their average yield per mu by more than double compared to last year. In Wuzhai County, where yields were previously low, the average yield per mu of 200,000 mu of flax increased by 80% compared to last year. The 1,765 mu of high-yield oil crop fields jointly operated by the Xiahaizi and Haizi management districts of the Haibeitou People's Commune in the suburbs of Datong City achieved an average yield of 82.7 jin per mu, double that of last year, with 160 mu creating a high-yield record of 120 jin per mu.

    The Yanbei and Jinxi Northwest areas of the Jinbei Special District are nationally known low-yield areas, with low grain yields and even lower oil crop yields in the past. During the Great Leap Forward last year, grain production in this region had already caught up. With the occurrence of this enormous change, and the continuous increase in the needs of industrial and agricultural construction and the people's lives, the issue of increasing oil crop production has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the leadership in this region has made the Great Leap Forward in oil production an important task this year, strengthening leadership in all aspects and achieving a bumper harvest.

    各种油料作物普告大面积丰收
    晋北油料自给有余
    历来油料不能自给的山西省晋北专区，今年油料作物空前大丰收。根据已经脱粒的实产量和一部分预测估算，今年全区油料作物平均每亩产量比去年提高三成半，由于种植面积的扩大，总产量比去年提高六成多。随着油料生产情况的根本好转，今年全区油料除做到自给外，还能卖给国家一些，支援外地。
    全区一百三十六万亩胡麻、向日葵、大麻、黄芥、黑芥、小麻等油料作物，目前已经全部收割登场，一半以上脱粒入仓。大面积丰收捷报，不断地从四面八方传来。阳高、浑源、原平、五台等县今年油料作物总产量都比去年增加一倍左右；兴县、河曲两县平均亩产量都超过了去年一倍多。过去产量不高的五寨县，二十万亩胡麻平均亩产比去年提高80％；大同市郊区海北头人民公社下海子和海子两个管理区联合经营的一千七百六十五亩油料作物丰产田，平均亩产量达到八十二斤七两，比去年提高了一倍，其中有一百六十亩创造了平均亩产一百二十斤的高额丰产纪录。
    晋北专区的雁北、晋西北一带都是闻名全国的低产区，过去粮食产量低，油料产量更低。去年大跃进中，这个地区粮食产量已经赶了上去。随着这一巨大变化的发生，以及工农业建设和人民生活需要的不断增加，增产油料的问题就越来越突出。因此，这个地区的领导上就把油料生产大跃进作为今年的一项重要任务，从各方面加强了领导，取得了丰收。（附图片）
