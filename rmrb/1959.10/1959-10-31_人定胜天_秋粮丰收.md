    Man Will Conquer Nature: Autumn Grain Harvest

    In the South, the yield of 100 million mu of double-cropping late rice exceeds that of early rice; the yield of single-cropping late rice catches up with that of middle-season rice.

    In the North, 30 million mu of rice has been basically harvested, with a general increase in production compared to last year.

    The per-mu yield and total yield of 540 million mu of coarse grains will exceed last year's.

    In the nationwide surging tide of the continued Great Leap Forward, more than 800 million mu of autumn grain has achieved a general bumper harvest. This is a great victory for the people's communes in resolutely implementing the Party's policy of opposing Rightism, boosting morale, practicing increased production and thrift, and vigorously grasping the overproduction movement. It is also a great victory for the people's communes in various regions in overcoming various natural disasters and conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Judging from the harvesting situation in various regions, the per-unit yield of the approximately 100 million mu of double-cropping late rice in the South will exceed this year's early rice yield. The per-unit yield of the single-cropping late rice, which is currently being harvested, will also exceed this year's middle-season rice yield. In the North, more than 30 million mu of rice has been basically harvested, with many regions increasing production by 30 to 40 percent. The per-unit yield and total yield of 540 million mu of miscellaneous grains such as corn, millet, and sorghum will exceed last year's. 30 million mu of potatoes and 160 million mu of sweet potatoes have also achieved a bumper harvest.

    The rapidly progressing autumn harvest across the country is nearing its end. Currently, northern provinces are harvesting sweet potatoes and peanuts, and most grain crops have been harvested, with the autumn harvest forces now shifting to threshing. In the South, various regions are harvesting late rice.

    Autumn harvest grain crops have generally achieved a bumper harvest, from Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," to Heilongjiang, known as the "Granary," from the southeastern coast to the northwestern plateau, including many areas that suffered severe droughts and floods and other natural disasters this summer and autumn. This is a great victory for the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, as well as a great victory for the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. It is also a great victory for the overproduction movement launched by the people's communes in various regions in resolutely implementing the Party's resolutions on opposing Rightism, boosting morale, and practicing increased production and thrift.

    The late rice in the southern provinces and regions generally has large ears and heavy grains. The per-unit yield of the approximately 100 million mu of double-cropping late rice will generally exceed this year's early rice yield. The per-unit yield of the single-cropping late rice, which is currently being harvested, will also exceed this year's middle-season rice yield. In Hunan Province, the average yield per mu of the 3.7 million mu of single-cropping late rice that has been harvested is 540 jin, and the average yield per mu of the 1.9 million mu of double-cropping late rice that has been harvested is 511 jin, both of which are higher than last year's yield and exceed this year's early rice yield, catching up with middle-season rice. In Jiangxi Province, more than 5 million mu of single-cropping late rice and 2 million mu of double-cropping late rice that have been harvested have achieved bumper harvests. In Tonggu County, a mountainous and cold area, the average yield per mu of the more than 80,000 mu of single-cropping late rice that has been harvested is 450 jin, which is 32% higher than the average yield per mu of this year's early rice. In Guangze County in the Wuyi Mountains of Fujian, the average yield per mu of the 120,000 mu of single-cropping late rice that has been harvested has increased by about 20% compared to last year. Various regions have also seen many large areas of high-yield fields and small areas of extremely high-yield fields. In Youxi Brigade of Hangchuan People's Commune in Guangze County, Fujian, a 12.5-mu high-yield experimental field of single-cropping late rice achieved an average yield of 1,334 jin per mu.

    The more than 30 million mu of rice planted this year in the northern provinces and regions has been basically harvested. Judging from the harvesting and threshing situation in various regions, a bumper harvest has also been achieved. This year, northern rice encountered drought during planting, and many regions encountered severe rain and flood disasters during growth. However, the people's communes boosted their morale and overcame these disasters, achieving a bumper harvest. The 800,000 mu of rice in the Ningxia irrigation area has all been harvested. According to the harvesting situation in twelve counties and cities in the Yinchuan and Yongning irrigation areas, the total rice production is estimated to increase by more than 40% compared to last year. The 2 million mu of rice planted in the suburbs of Tianjin has grown particularly well. According to actual harvesting and measurement, the rice yield not only exceeded last year's best harvest but also exceeded the original estimated yield. For example, the famous Tuanbowan Commune in Jinghai County, which has transformed low-lying land for rice cultivation, has increased the actual yield of rice by 34% compared to last year and has seen large areas of high-yield fields yielding over 1,000 jin. The 693,000 mu of rice planted in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province is expected to yield an average of 580 jin per mu, exceeding last year's bumper harvest yield, based on partial actual harvest and acceptance. The new rice areas in Huaibei, Anhui, and eastern and central Henan have also achieved bumper harvests. The 3 million mu of rice replanted in Fuyang Prefecture in Huaibei yielded one to two times more than dryland grain crops.

    The per-unit yield and total yield of 540 million mu of autumn-harvested miscellaneous grain crops across the country, including corn, millet, and sorghum, will exceed last year's. Early autumn grain crops have been harvested, and the remaining late autumn miscellaneous grain crops, except for buckwheat, late corn, and small miscellaneous beans in the South which are still being harvested, have also been basically harvested. According to the harvesting and threshing situation in various regions, the per-unit yield is generally expected to increase by 10% to over 10% compared to last year. Henan Province achieved a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought, with both the per-unit yield and total yield of corn, millet, and sorghum exceeding last year's bumper harvest. The yield of autumn-harvested miscellaneous grain crops in Shandong and Anhui provinces has increased compared to last year. Through the unremitting drought resistance efforts of the people of Sichuan Province, the total grain production of the province is estimated to increase by more than 10% compared to last year. After trial harvesting and estimation, the total production of autumn-harvested grain crops in Xinjiang is estimated to increase by about 20% compared to last year. The areas in northern China that suffered severe flood disasters have also achieved bumper harvests through the disaster resistance efforts of the people's communes. In the Tangshan area of Hebei Province, which suffered particularly severe flooding, the water conservancy projects built in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, have been relied upon to overcome the floods, resulting in an average yield of 426 jin per mu for 2.48 million mu of corn and an average yield of 474 jin per mu for 770,000 mu of sorghum. Liaoning Province overcame the flood disasters, resulting in an average yield per mu of autumn-harvested grain crops increasing by about 20% compared to last year. Many large-area and small-area high-yield models of miscellaneous grains have also emerged.

    Tuber crops suffered relatively severe drought and flood disasters during their growth period, but through the disaster resistance efforts of the people's communes in various regions, this year's tuber crops also achieved a bumper harvest. Currently, the 30 million mu of potatoes across the country has been basically harvested, and the 160 million mu of sweet potatoes are being harvested. According to the harvesting and yield measurement of the approximately 18 million mu of sweet potatoes cultivated in Henan Province, the per-unit yield is expected to increase by more than 40% compared to last year. The per-mu yield of the more than 25 million mu of sweet potatoes in Shandong Province will also exceed the highest yield in history. In Guan County, Shandong Province, the average yield per mu of the 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes that have been harvested is 3,542 jin. In Fuyang County, Anhui Province, the average yield per mu of the 90,000 mu of sweet potatoes that have been harvested is 4,000 jin. In Dacheng Brigade of Matian People's Commune in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, the average yield per mu of the 175 mu of sweet potatoes that have been harvested, after acceptance, is more than 15,800 jin, of which 15 mu yielded 22,310 jin per mu.

    During the autumn harvest period, party committees in various regions strengthened their leadership over the autumn harvest work, continued to oppose Rightism and boost morale, launched a magnificent mass movement, and at the same time carried out meticulous organizational work, fully utilizing the superiority of the people's communes, rationally arranged labor, livestock, and tools, and vigorously grasped the reform of autumn harvest tools, making the autumn harvest movement develop very healthily, with fast progress and good quality.

    高举总路线的红旗，战胜严重的旱涝灾害
    人定胜天　秋粮丰收
    南方一亿亩双季晚稻超过早稻，单季晚稻赶上中稻
    北方三千万亩水稻基本收割完毕，普遍比去年增产
    五亿四千万亩杂粮亩产量和总产量都可超过去年
    在全国继续跃进的浪潮中，八亿多亩秋粮获得普遍的丰收，这是各地人民公社坚决贯彻执行党的反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约，狠抓超产运动的伟大胜利，也是各地人民公社战胜各种自然灾害和认真贯彻八字宪法的伟大胜利。从各地收割的情况来看，南方的一亿亩左右的双季晚稻，单位面积产量将超过今年的早稻。正在收打的单季晚稻，单位面积产量也将超过今年的中稻。北方三千多万亩水稻，已基本收完，许多地区增产三成四成。五亿四千万亩的玉米、谷子、高粱等杂粮，单位面积产量和总产量都将超过去年。三千万亩马铃薯和一亿六千万亩甘薯也获得大丰收。
    据新华社30日讯　全国农村进展迅速的秋收已近尾声。现在，北方各省正在收获甘薯和花生，各种粮食作物多已收完，秋收力量已转入打场脱粒；南方各地正在收打晚稻。
    秋收粮食作物普遍获得了丰收，从“天府之国”的四川到被称为“粮仓”的黑龙江，从东南沿海到西北高原，包括许多今年夏秋遭受了严重干旱和洪涝等自然灾害的地方都获得了丰收。这是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，也是农业“八字宪法”的伟大胜利，也是各地人民公社坚决贯彻执行党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的决议而掀起的超产运动的伟大胜利。
    南方各省区的晚稻普遍长得穗大、粒重，一亿亩左右的双季晚稻，单位面积产量将普遍超过今年的早稻产量；正在收打的单季晚稻，单位面积产量也将超过今年中稻的产量。湖南省已收割的三百七十多万亩单季晚稻，平均亩产五百四十斤，已收的一百九十多万亩双季晚稻，平均亩产五百一十一斤，都比去年增产，超过了今年早稻，赶上了中稻。江西省已收打的五百多万亩单季晚稻和二百万亩双季晚稻都获得了丰收，山高水冷的铜鼓县收打的八万多亩单季晚稻，平均亩产四百五十斤，比今年早稻的平均亩产量高出32％。福建武夷山区的光泽县，收割的十二万亩单季晚稻，平均亩产量比去年增产20％左右。各地还出现了许多大面积丰产田和小面积高额丰产田。福建光泽县杭川人民公社油溪大队培植的一片十二亩五分单季晚稻高产试验田，平均亩产达到一千三百三十四斤。
    今年北方各省区种植的三千多万亩水稻，已基本收完，从各地收打脱粒的情况看，也获得了丰收。今年北方水稻在种植时遇到了干旱，在生长时，许多地区又遇到了严重的雨涝灾害，但各人民公社鼓起更大的干劲，战胜了这些灾害，取得了丰收。宁夏灌区八十万亩水稻已全部登场，根据银川、永宁灌区的十二个县市收打情况估计，水稻的总产量可比去年增产40％以上。天津市郊区种植的二百万亩水稻生长得特别好，根据实打、实测，水稻产量不仅超过了收成最好的去年，而且突破了原估计的产量。像全国著名的改造洼地种植水稻的静海县团泊洼公社，今年水稻的实产量比去年提高34％，并出现了千斤以上的大面积丰产田。吉林延边朝鲜族自治州种植的六十九万三千多亩水稻，根据部分实打验收的情况预计，平均每亩可产五百八十斤，超过去年大丰收的产量。安徽淮北和河南东部、中部新稻区也获得了丰收。淮北阜阳专区改种的三百万亩水稻比旱田粮食作物增产一倍到两倍以上。
    全国各地五亿四千万亩秋收的杂粮作物包括玉米、谷子、高粱等，单位面积产量和总产量都可超过去年。早秋粮食作物已收完，晚秋杂粮作物除南方的荞麦、晚玉米、小杂豆等还在陆续收获外，其余也已基本收完，根据各地收打脱粒的情况预计，单位面积产量一般比去年增产一成到一成以上。河南省做到了大旱年大丰收，玉米、谷子、高粱等作物的单产量和总产量都比大丰收的去年高。山东、安徽秋收的杂粮作物的产量都比去年增产。四川省经过全省人民不懈的抗旱斗争，全省粮食总产量估计可比去年增产10％以上。新疆秋收粮食作物经试打估算，总产量可比去年增产20％左右。我国北方遭受严重洪涝灾害的地区，经过各人民公社抗灾斗争，也获得了丰收。河北省遭受水灾特别严重的唐山地区，依靠几年来特别是大跃进以来水利工程，战胜了水灾，使全区二百四十八万亩玉米平均亩产四百二十六斤，七十七万亩高粱平均亩产四百七十四斤。辽宁省战胜了洪涝灾害，使全省秋收粮食作物平均亩产比去年增产20％左右。杂粮也出现了许多大面积和小面积的丰产典型。
    薯类作物在生长期间遭受到了干旱和水涝等灾害较重，但经各地人民公社的抗灾斗争，使今年薯类也获得了丰收。目前，全国三千万亩马铃薯已基本收完，一亿六千万亩甘薯正在收获。河南省栽培的一千八百万亩左右的甘薯，据已收和测产，单位面积产量可比去年增长40％以上。山东省二千五百多万亩甘薯亩产量也将超过历史上最高的产量，这个省冠县已收的十万亩甘薯，平均亩产三千五百四十二斤。安徽阜阳县已收的九万亩甘薯平均亩产四千斤。湖南永兴县马田人民公社大城大队已收的一百七十五亩甘薯，经过验收平均亩产一万五千八百多斤，其中有十五亩亩产二万二千三百一十斤。
    在秋收期间，各地党委加强了对秋收工作的领导，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，开展了波澜壮阔的群众运动，同时作了细致的组织工作，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，合理地安排了劳力、畜力和工具，并且大抓秋收工具的改革，使秋收运动发展得很健康，进度快，质量好。（附图片）
