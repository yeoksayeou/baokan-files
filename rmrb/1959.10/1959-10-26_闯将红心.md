The national model worker, Li Fuxiang, a boring machine operator at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, completed sixteen years and ten months' worth of work in six months of actual work this year. People call him a "pioneer."

On all fronts of our socialist construction, there are tens of thousands of skilled workers like Li Fuxiang who are completing their tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding their quotas. However, there is one thing that sets Li Fuxiang apart from others: he was originally a drilling machine operator. He switched to boring at the beginning of this year. How did this happen? At the beginning of the year, the boring machine production in the metalworking workshop was not improving and defective products often emerged. This became a weak link in the workshop. At that time, in order to meet the needs of production, the workshop leaders decided to transfer Li Fuxiang to become a boring machine operator, asking him to lead all comrades to advance together.

This was not without difficulties for Li Fuxiang. Firstly, he had been working on drilling machines for five or six years, and he was not familiar with boring machine technology. He had to learn the technology from scratch. Secondly, the boring machine operators were all senior master craftsmen, and it would not be easy to maintain unity. However, when he thought that he was a Communist Party member and an advanced producer, he felt a great responsibility and a sense of duty. Therefore, he obeyed the organization's assignment without hesitation. The people in the boring machine operator group had different attitudes towards him. Some welcomed him, believing that it was an honor for the national model worker to come to our work to work together. Others took a wait-and-see attitude, and some secretly said: "You are a model worker in drilling machines, but you may not be able to succeed in boring machines. Be careful not to make mistakes and lose your title of model worker."

Facing this situation, how did Li Fuxiang carry out his work?

First, he earnestly studied the technology to improve his production skills, taking the lead everywhere, and using his practical actions to influence and motivate everyone. On the one hand, he humbly sought advice from the master craftsmen with the attitude of a primary school student to learn the technology. On the other hand, he studied diligently on his own, using his brain to carry out technical innovations and striving to improve the quality and quantity of production. When he found a trick, he took the initiative to introduce it to other master craftsmen. At the same time, he also relied on the help of the Party group to carry out detailed ideological work according to different objects. For example, one comrade sometimes liked to gossip about others behind their backs. Li Fuxiang educated him that he should demand himself with the excellent qualities of the working class, prompting him to change his attitude. He also helped comrades through the group's democratic life meetings, and also conducted home visits during holidays to understand the situation and improve relationships. Because Comrade Li Fuxiang sincerely and patiently helped the four boring machine master craftsmen according to their characteristics, he promoted ideological understanding among everyone, thereby improving mutual relations and strengthening unity.

What can we see from this? Li Fuxiang is praised and has become an advanced producer not only because he is a skilled worker, but also because he is a person with communist style. He is not only a pioneer, but also has the bright red heart of the working class. He is wholeheartedly loyal to the Party, humble and enthusiastic to the masses, fearless in the face of difficulties, and always holds high the red flag in labor and life. He always remembers that he is a Communist Party member and an advanced element of the working class. In the face of such a noble style, how small and wretched those individualists who haggle over personal interests appear!

We need more pioneers and more red flag bearers. They are the vanguards of the rapid development of socialist construction!

    闯将红心
    边会材
    全国劳动模范、上海锅炉厂的镗工李福祥在今年六个月的实际工作日里，完成了十六年零十个月的工作量。人们称他为“闯将”。
    在我们社会主义建设的各个战线上，正有成千上万像李福祥这样提前超额完成任务的能手，但是李福祥还有一点与人不同的地方，就是他原来是钻工，从今年年初起，改行当了镗工。这是怎样一回事情呢？年初时，金工车间的镗床生产老是提不高，而且常常出废品，成了车间的薄弱环节。当时车间领导为了适应生产需要，决定把李福祥调去改行做镗工，要求他带动所有同志，共同前进。
    这件事对李福祥来说，不是没有困难的，一则在钻床上已做了五、六年，对镗床技术却是不熟悉的，技术要从头学起来，再则几个镗工又都是高级老师傅，不容易搞好团结。但是当他想到自己是个共产党员，又是先进生产者时，感到责任重大，义不容辞，因此就毫不犹豫地服从了组织的调配。镗工组里的人对他的态度是各有不同的，一种是欢迎的，认为全国劳模调到我们工种里来共同劳动，这是镗工的光荣；另一种是抱观望态度，个别也有暗地里说：“做钻床你是劳动模范，做镗床你不一定吃得开，当心出了毛病，劳模称号保不牢。”
    面临这种情况，李福祥是怎样进行工作的呢？
    他首先认真钻研技术，提高生产技术水平，处处带头，以自己的实际行动来影响和带动大家。一面以小学生的态度虚心求教，向老师傅学习技术，一面又自己认真钻研，动脑筋搞技术革新，努力提高产质量，当自己找到了一点窍门时，主动介绍给别的老师傅。同时，他又依靠党小组的帮助，根据不同对象，分别进行细致的思想工作。例如有一个同志有时喜欢在背后议论别人，李福祥就教育他应该以工人阶级的优秀品质来要求自己，促进他改变了态度。他还通过小组民主生活会对同志们进行帮助，还利用假日进行家庭访问，了解情况，搞好关系。由于李福祥同志根据四位镗工老师傅的特点，进行了诚恳而又耐心的帮助，促使大家思想见面，由此相互关系改善了，团结加强了。
    从这里我们可以看到什么呢？李福祥之所以被人称颂，所以成为先进生产者，不仅是因为他是生产能手，而且也因为他是有共产主义风格的人。他不仅是一员闯将，而且有鲜艳的工人阶级的红心。对党赤胆忠心，对群众谦虚热情，在困难面前一无畏惧，在劳动和生活里永远高举着红旗，永远记住自己是个共产党员，是工人阶级的一个先进分子。在这样的崇高风格面前，那些斤斤较量个人利益的个人主义者显得多么渺小，又多么猥琐！
    我们需要更多的闯将，更多的红旗手，他们是社会主义建设事业飞速发展的先锋！
