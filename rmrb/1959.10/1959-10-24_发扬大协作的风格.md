    Promote the Style of Large-Scale Collaboration
    On the industrial front in Beijing and Shanghai, a vigorous atmosphere of collaboration has emerged. Factories and mines, teams and teams, individuals and individuals create conditions for each other, helping each other, giving full support, and closely integrating. The scope of collaboration is unprecedentedly wide, the forms of collaboration are rich and varied, and the ideology of collaboration is deeply rooted in people's hearts. This situation is truly exhilarating and heartwarming.
    Under the situation of a great leap in production, the emergence of communist collaboration reflects the great power of the Party's anti-rightist and encouraging efforts, and reflects the fact that the pace of the Great Leap Forward is moving towards a more stable stage. Marx said: "Collaboration produces a new productive force." In a society with private ownership of the means of production, what factory owners pursue is maximum profit, their own selfish interests; of course, there can be no real collaboration. Only in a society with public ownership of the means of production, where people's communist ideological consciousness has been universally improved, can the atmosphere of collaboration flourish and new productive forces emerge.
    The socialist cause is the common cause of millions of people. Since the Great Leap Forward, in order to accelerate the speed of socialist progress, that kind of spirit of you helping me, me helping you, that kind of vision, broad-mindedness, and adherence to collective interests as the guiding principle of action, that kind of selflessness, putting others before oneself, that kind of leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others, that kind of noble style of taking the world as one's own responsibility, has added brilliant brilliance to our era.
    If everyone promotes the style of large-scale collaboration, thoroughly reverses right-leaning ideas, and goes all out, our production upsurge will continue to rise.

    发扬大协作的风格
    北京、上海工业战线大兴协作之风，厂矿与厂矿、小组与小组、个人与个人之间，互相创造条件，你帮我，我帮你，通力支援，紧密结合，协作范围空前广泛，协作形式丰富多采，协作思想深入人心。这种形势，真叫人欢欣鼓舞，心花怒放。
    在生产大高涨的形势下，出现了共产主义大协作，反映了党的反右倾、鼓干劲的巨大力量，反映了大跃进的步伐走向更稳健的阶段。马克思说：“协作产生新的生产力”。在生产资料私有制的社会里，工厂主所追求的是最大的利润，是一己之私利；当然，也就不可能有真正的协作。只有生产资料公有制的社会里，人们的共产主义思想觉悟有了普遍提高的情况下，协作之风才能大兴，新的生产力才能涌现。
    社会主义事业是千百万人的共同事业。大跃进以来，人们为了加快社会主义前进的速度，那种你帮我、我帮你，那种目光四射，胸怀广阔，以集体利益为行动准则的风气，那种大公无私、先人后己，那种把困难留给自己，方便让给别人，那种以天下为己任的高尚风格，为我们的时代增添了灿烂的光彩。
    人人发扬大协作的风格，深入地反透右倾，鼓足干劲，我们的生产高潮就会不断高涨。
