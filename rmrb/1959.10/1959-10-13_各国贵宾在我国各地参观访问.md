Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th. István Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, visited and toured Dujiangyan in Guanxian County today. Accompanied the distinguished guest were Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China; Wang Zhen, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation; Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Sichuan Province; Zhao Cangbi, Secretary of the Provincial Committee and Deputy Governor; and Mi Jianshu, Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Mayor.

Chairman Dobi stood with great interest on a high mountain, viewing the panoramic view of Dujiangyan and the Yuzui Hydropower Station under construction. He also toured the ancient Erwang Temple, the bamboo cable bridge, and the Baopingkou. Chairman Dobi praised this huge water conservancy project built by the ancient working people of our country, believing it to be the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese people throughout the ages. He said that people thought of harnessing this river more than 2,000 years ago, which shows that it was frequently flooded. The completion of the water conservancy projects currently under construction and planned for the future will bring greater happiness to the people. Although our two countries, Hungary and China, are far apart, we are brothers, so I am happy to see this project.

During the tour, Chairman Dobi had cordial conversations with the staff and workers at the hydropower station construction site, inquiring about their work and living conditions.
