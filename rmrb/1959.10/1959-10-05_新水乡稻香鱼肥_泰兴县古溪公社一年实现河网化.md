New Water Towns with Fragrant Rice and Fat Fish
——Guxi Commune in Taixing County Achieves River Network Transformation in One Year
Jun Hua
	As the sun rises, the crisscrossing rivers shimmer with golden light, and small boats filled with aquatic plants drift slowly in the wind. Suddenly, a plump silver carp leaps from the water, startling the tranquil fields. On both sides of the river, the heavy rice ears are like a thick golden carpet laid on the earth... What a beautiful scene of a Jiangnan water town! This is the Guxi People's Commune in Taixing, Jiangsu Province, which achieved a high standard of river network transformation this year.

	Crisscrossing River Networks
	Look at those square plots of land, divided by large rivers, small rivers, and production ditches! The entire commune, with the Gu Ma Xin River and Xin Si Yan River as its backbone, has a river channel 40 meters wide every kilometer and a production ditch 12 meters wide every 200 meters. Four electric irrigation stations have been newly built on the Xin Si Yan Port and three river channels. Countless main canals, branch canals, and minor canals lie along the banks of the rivers and production ditches, like giant dragons. The water of the Yangtze River, through the Gu Ma Xin River, travels more than seventy miles to nourish the more than 20,000 mu of rice and dry crops here.

	People who come to Guxi Commune for the first time praise the scenery here. That magnificent river network project was undertaken by the heroic people of Guxi in the first year after the establishment of the commune. I remember visiting here before last year's National Day. At that time, the pilot river network project had just started. The entire commune did not have a decent river channel, and the few small ports and ditches were all blocked. At the slightest breeze, yellow sand would roll, and the masses called the soil here "flying up to the sky when the wind blows, flowing away with the rain." At that time, when I heard Comrade Dong Dalai, the secretary of the commune party committee, introduce the overall river network plan of the commune, most comrades were encouraged and spurred on. However, a few individuals expressed doubts, worrying that they would fail. But failure will never befall those who are full of energy and strive for the top. More than 8,000 commune members fought hard for eight months, overcoming numerous difficulties, and completed more than 3.8 million cubic meters of earthwork. Finally, they dug nine river channels, sixty production ditches, and one hundred and ninety-four canals on the flat ground. 70% of the commune's area has achieved river network transformation and electric irrigation.

	This year, we encountered a major drought of sixty days without rain, but the water in the rivers and ditches was still full, and no field in the commune suffered from drought. Now, the rice is golden, with long ears and large grains. The earlier "Victory Indica" has already started harvesting; the sorghum spikes and corn cobs on the "green gauze tent" have mostly been harvested and stored, and the tall and sturdy stalks still leave people with a scene of harvest. Buckwheat, carrots, and other late autumn crops are thriving and growing every day.

	Golden Ocean
	Fengjiazhuang in Tongxing Brigade used to be a place where "there was nowhere to drain the water when it rained heavily, and no water came when there was a drought." The soil was extremely poor, all saline-alkali land, and people called it "salt mud pond." Before liberation, it was barren nine years out of ten. Since 1957, with the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, rice has been planted, and production has developed. However, because the water conservancy conditions have not been fundamentally changed, the yield per unit area cannot be quickly increased. Last year, the average yield per mu only increased by 20% compared to 1957, yielding only two hundred and ninety catties. People composed a folk song saying: "Fengjiazhuang has a salt mud pond, the land is barren, it turns into a grass pond when it rains heavily, and salt frost appears when there is a drought."

	Now, Fengjiazhuang has changed greatly. Two river channels have been dug, and an electric irrigation station has been established, so there is no worry about drought or flood. This year, there was no rain for sixty days, but the rice fields never lacked water. Because less labor was used for drought resistance, the entire team was able to free up a large number of laborers to travel hundreds of miles to the coast to collect clams and snails for fertilizer, and with more harrowing and weeding, and careful management, the rice is now growing beautifully, like a golden ocean. Two mu of relatively poor "Victory Indica" have already been harvested and threshed, with a yield of 423 catties per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The commune members smiled and said happily: "Fengjiazhuang has a salt mud pond, now the face has changed greatly, thanks to the communization, thanks to the Communist Party."

	Livestock Thrive
	Taixing County is famous for raising many pigs, and Guxi Commune is among the best in the county in terms of the number of pigs raised. The entire commune has 5,107 households, with a total of 13,868 publicly and privately raised pigs, an average of more than two pigs per household and one pig for every two mu of land. Currently, among the 2,060 sows in the entire commune, piglets are born every day, and the number of piglets is increasing day by day.

	Since communization, the commune and the commune members' sideline production have been fully developed. Fish is a new and rapidly developing sideline occupation since communization. As soon as the river network project started, the commune party committee transferred a group of commune members who had some knowledge of fish farming, went out to "seek teachers and visit friends," and "learn techniques" to learn artificial hatching and fish farming techniques. In the spring, in addition to buying more than 300,000 adult fish from other places for stocking, they also engaged in artificial carp hatching and produced more than 1 million fish fry. Plump silver carp, carp, and grass carp were stocked in the river channels and production ditches. The commune also specially established a fisheries brigade to manage the fish farming business. Now, the stocked adult fish already weigh one or two catties, and the fish fry they raised are also four or five inches long. Duck farming is also a new business brought about by the river network transformation. Although not many are raised now, only more than 5,000, which is only a quarter of the number of chickens, it is only a good start, and like other production businesses, it is also developing rapidly.

    新水乡稻香鱼肥
    ——泰兴县古溪公社一年实现河网化
    俊华
    旭日初升，纵横交错的河面上，金光粼粼，一条一条装满水草的小船，迎风缓缓吹来。突然间，一尾肥嫩的鲢鱼拍水跃起，惊动了恬静的田野。河两岸，沉甸甸的稻穗，像给大地铺上了厚厚的一层金毯……。好一幅江南水乡的景色！这里是今年才实现高标准河网化的江苏省泰兴古溪人民公社。
    纵横交错的河网
    你看，那些被大河、小河、生产沟格成方方正正的一块一块的土地！全公社以古马新河、新私盐河为纲，每隔一千米就有一条面宽四十米的河道，每隔二百米就有一条面宽十二米的生产沟。在新私盐港和三条河道上，新建了四个电力灌溉站。无数的干渠、支渠和斗渠，横卧在河道与生产沟的岸边，像是条条巨龙。长江的水，通过古马新河，经过七十多里路程，哺育着这里两万多亩水稻和旱谷。
    初到古溪公社的人，都称赞这里的景色。那规模宏伟的河网化工程，是英雄的古溪人民在成立公社后的头一年干起来的。记得在去年国庆前夕，我曾来过这里。那时，河网化的试点工程刚才动工，全社看不到一条像样的河道，有少数的小港小沟，也都是断港塞沟；一遇大风，就是黄沙滚滚，群众称这里的土壤是“刮风飞上天，下雨顺水流”。当时，听到公社党委书记董大来同志介绍全公社河网化规划时，绝大部分同志得到了鼓舞和鞭策；也有个别人表示怀疑，心里担心他们会失败。但是，失败的始终不会是鼓足干劲、力争上游的人们。全公社八千多民工，奋战了八个月，克服了重重困难，共做了三百八十多万土方，终于在平地上挖出了九条河道、六十条生产沟和一百九十四条渠道，全公社70％的面积实现了河网化、电（力）灌（溉）化。
    今年，遇到了六十天无雨的大旱，河沟的水还是满满的，全社没有一块田受旱。现在，稻子一片金黄，穗长粒大，比较早的“胜利籼”已经开镰收割；那“青纱帐”上的高粱穗子、玉米拐子，大部已收获归仓，高大粗壮的秆子，仍然给人们留下了丰收的景象。荞麦、胡萝卜等晚秋作物更是欣欣向荣，天天见长。
    金色海洋
    同兴大队的封家庄，是一个“雨大没处排，天旱水不来”的地方，土质极坏，全是盐碱地，人们称之为“盐泥荡”。解放前，这里十年九荒。自从1957年以后，随着小型水利工程的兴建，改种了水稻，生产有了发展。但是，由于水利条件没有根本改，单产量还不能很快提高。去年平均单产比1957年增加20％，每亩也只收了二百九十斤。人们编了一首歌谣说：“封家庄有个盐泥荡，土地一片荒，雨大变草荡，天旱冒盐霜。”
    现在，封家庄大大地变样了，挖了两条河道，建立了电灌站，旱涝无忧。今年六十天不落雨，稻田里从没脱过水。由于抗旱劳力用得少，全队就腾出了大批劳力远征百里以外，到海边去摸蛤子、螺蛳作肥料，再加上多耙多除草，加工管理，目前稻子长得惹人喜爱，像一片金色的海洋。有两亩较差的“胜利籼”已经收割脱粒，亩产达到四百二十三斤，比去年增加40％。社员们眉开颜笑，高兴地说：“封家庄有个盐泥荡，如今面貌大变样，多亏公社化，感谢共产党。”
    六畜兴旺
    泰兴县以养猪多闻名，古溪公社养猪数量在全县又是名列前茅。全社五千一百零七户，共有公养、私养猪一万三千八百六十八头，每户平均两头多，每两亩地就有一头猪。现在，全社二千零六十头母猪中，天天都生下猪仔，猪仔的数字与日俱增。
    自从公社化以后，公社与社员的副业生产全面发展了。鱼，是公社化以后突飞猛进的新兴副业。河网化工程刚动工，公社党委就抽调了一批原来有些养鱼知识的社员，出外“寻师访友”、“取经学道”，学习人工孵化、养鱼的技术。春天，除了在外地买了三十多万尾成鱼放养外，自己又搞鲤鱼人工孵化，生产了一百多万鱼花，河道里、生产沟里，都放养肥嫩的鲢鱼、鲤鱼和青鱼。社里还特地成立了一个渔业大队，专门管理养鱼事业。现在，放养的成鱼已经有一、二斤重，自己搞的鱼花也有四、五寸长了。养鸭，也是河网化带来的新兴事业，现在虽然养得不多，只有五千多只，只及鸡的四分之一，但只是一个良好的开端，像其他各项生产事业也在飞速发展中。
