Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Mehdi Ben Barka, Secretary of the General Secretariat of the National Union of People's Forces of Morocco, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that the main goal of the Moroccan people is: to withdraw all foreign troops from their own territory, and to seek economic liberation in order to eliminate the remnants of the colonial system and build a new Morocco.

Mehdi Ben Barka is the leader of the Moroccan National Union of People's Forces delegation invited to attend the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He met with Xinhua News Agency reporters in Beijing today. He said that the troops of the United States, France, and Spain still occupy a part of Moroccan territory. This is a manifestation of the remnants of the colonial system and these troops must be withdrawn.

He said that for a long time, the development of Moroccan mineral deposits has mainly served French capitalists as a supplement to the French economy. This is another manifestation of the remnants of the colonial system and must be liberated from this situation.

Chairman Ben Barka expressed his firm belief that the Moroccan people will win in the struggle. He said: "What gives us more confidence is our friendship and unity with many Asian and African countries with the same ideals."

He said: "Our visit to China has strengthened our confidence in the future."

Chairman Ben Barka enthusiastically praised the achievements of China's socialist construction. He said, "We have personally seen that the Chinese people have indeed achieved positive results in the past ten years." He said that he was very moved by the modesty of Chairman Mao and other Chinese leaders.

Chairman Ben Barka said: "During our visits to Northeast China and Beijing, we learned many valuable experiences in eliminating backwardness, a phenomenon common to countries that have just been liberated from imperialist rule."

He emphasized that the primary problem of economically backward countries—the rural problem—has been solved in China. He said that the solution is the people's communes. He believes that the people's communes are an extremely effective form of getting rid of rural backwardness. He said: "Therefore, the people's communes, which are called the Chinese experience, have rich educational significance for us."

Chairman Ben Barka visited the people's communes in Northeast China. He said that the facts prove that the imperialist slanders that the people's communes break up families are complete lies. He also refuted other imperialist rumors and slanders against the people's communes. He emphasized:
"The most important fact is that hundreds of millions of peasants actively and enthusiastically participate in labor, and this is the most powerful counterattack against imperialist slanders."

Chairman Ben Barka also said that China's policy of "walking on two legs" has been successfully realized. "I have visited various types of factories in Northeast China. What particularly touched me was the workers' high degree of political consciousness and enthusiasm for labor, which can be vividly reflected in activities such as workers' big-character posters and competition movements."

He also emphasized that China has made great efforts to protect the welfare of children and mothers.

He said that he was deeply moved by the simplicity, sincerity, and frankness of the Chinese people.

When talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Moroccan people, Chairman Ben Barka said that the delegation's invitation to attend the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China expresses the Moroccan people's friendship towards the Chinese people. This friendship has a long history, and the common situation of being exploited by imperialism and the struggle against imperialism have brought the people of the two countries closer. He expressed the hope that there will be more visits and contacts in the future in order to further expand the understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries.

　　摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟代表团团长巴尔卡发表谈话
    摩洛哥人民要求撤走外国军队
    中国人民十年来取得富有积极意义的成果
    新华社13日讯　摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟总书记处书记迈赫迪·本·巴尔卡今天对新华社记者说，摩洛哥人民当前一致的主要奋斗目标是：从自己的国土上撤走一切外国军队，并求得经济解放，以消除殖民制度的残余，建设新的摩洛哥。
    迈赫迪·本·巴尔卡是应邀前来参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝典礼的摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟代表团的团长。他今天在北京接见了新华社记者。他说，美国、法国、西班牙的军队目前还占领了摩洛哥一部分国土，这是殖民制度残余的一种表现，必须撤走这些军队。
    他说，长期以来摩洛哥矿藏的开发主要是为法国资本家服务，作为法国经济的一种补充，这是殖民制度残余的另一种表现，必须从这种状况下解放出来。
    本·巴尔卡团长表示深信，摩洛哥人民在斗争中一定会取得胜利。他说：“使我们更有信心的是我们跟许多具有同样理想的亚洲和非洲国家的友谊和团结。”
    他说：“我们在中国的访问更加强了我们对未来的信心。”
    本·巴尔卡团长热情地赞扬了我国社会主义建设的成就。他说，“我们亲眼看到了十年来中国人民的确取得了富有积极意义的成果。”他说，毛主席和中国其他领导人的谦虚使他非常感动。
    本·巴尔卡团长说：“我们在东北和北京等地的访问中学到了许多有关消除落后状态的宝贵的经验，而落后状态是刚刚从帝国主义统治下获得解放的国家共有的现象。”
  他着重指出，经济落后国家的首要问题——农村问题——在中国已经得到解决。他说，解决的办法就是人民公社。他认为人民公社这是摆脱农村落后状态的极为有效的形式。他说：“因此，称之为中国经验的人民公社对我们有着丰富的教育意义。”
    本·巴尔卡团长在东北参观过人民公社。他说，事实证明帝国主义污蔑人民公社拆散家庭的话完全是谎言。他还驳斥了帝国主义对人民公社的其他种种造谣诬蔑。他强调指出：
  “最重要的事实是几亿农民积极热情地参加劳动，这一点就是对帝国主义污蔑的最有力的回击。”
    本·巴尔卡团长还说，中国的“两腿走路”的方针已经成功地得到实现。“我在东北访问过各种类型的工厂，其中特别使我感动的是劳动者高度的政治觉悟和劳动热情，这些从工人的大字报、竞赛运动等活动中可以生动地体现出来。”
    他还着重指出，中国在保卫儿童和母亲福利方面也都作了很大的努力。
    他说，中国人民的纯朴、真诚和坦率使他深为感动。
    在谈到中国和摩洛哥人民之间的友谊时，本·巴尔卡团长说，这次代表团应邀参加中华人民共和国建国十周年的庆祝活动，便表示了摩洛哥人民对中国人民的友谊。这种友谊已经有了很长久的历史，而遭受帝国主义剥削的共同处境和对帝国主义的斗争使两国人民更加接近了。他表示希望今后有更多的访问和接触，以便更加扩大两国人民间的了解和友谊。
