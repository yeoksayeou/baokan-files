Shenyang, October 15th (People's Daily) – The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an industrial conference to deploy and arrange industrial production tasks for the first quarter of next year. The conference demanded that all industrial departments and factories and mines throughout the province work hard in the fourth quarter, and while ensuring the early and overfulfillment of this year's production plan, fully prepare for all aspects, seize a "flying start" next year, and strive to push the province's industry to a new peak as soon as next year begins, ensuring that the production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than the level in the fourth quarter of this year, and realizing a continued great leap forward for the entire year of next year.

The conference analyzed the current situation on the province's industrial front. Due to the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the opposition to rightist tendencies, and the encouragement of enthusiasm, tremendous changes have taken place on the province's industrial front, the mass movement has been surging higher and higher, and the situation in production and construction has been rising step by step. The province's total industrial output value in August increased by 12% compared with July, and in September it increased by 15.7% compared with August, creating a "flying start" in October as soon as the fourth quarter began. Currently, a new high tide of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial front is developing vigorously, and the socialist labor competition is in full swing. Based on this very favorable situation, the conference believes that as long as we continue to deeply oppose rightist tendencies and encourage enthusiasm, further carry out socialist labor competitions, especially technical performance competitions, and seize the specific production preparations in various aspects, fully tap the potential in all aspects, and mobilize the positive factors in all aspects, the province's industrial front will definitely be able to overfulfill this year's plan ahead of schedule by fifteen to twenty days.

When studying and arranging industrial production tasks for the first quarter of next year, the conference implemented and reflected the spirit of industry actively supporting agriculture, requiring greater increases in the production of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and chemical pesticides and other products.

In order to break the "routine" of low production levels at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the season, the conference required all relevant departments in the province to seize the following three aspects of preparation from now on.

First, make ideological preparations, mainly to deepen and thoroughly carry out the rectification movement against rightist tendencies, and further arm the minds of the vast number of cadres and the masses with the general line. The conference pointed out that this rectification movement should first rectify the ideological style of the cadres, and also carry out socialist education among the workers and staff. The rectification should be combined with production, and should be carried out with the great leap forward in production as the center. The rectification should be combined with the improvement of enterprise management, removing the remaining styles, methods, and systems in enterprises that are divorced from the leadership of the Party and the mass line, and further strengthening the leadership of the Party in enterprises and implementing the mass line.

Second, in terms of mass movement and enterprise management, the preparation is to continue to vigorously promote the mass movement through in-depth rectification, so that the mass movement that has already been launched can develop in depth, extensively, and persistently. We must deeply carry out competitions, especially technical performance competitions, to promote faster development of the movement. In the movement, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work. We must strengthen enterprise management, care for and improve the lives of employees, ensure a combination of work and rest, ensure safe production, and combine political and ideological work with material rewards, so that employees can be full of energy and maintain their enthusiasm persistently.

Third, the preparation for materials and technology must be carried out in a series of work in eight aspects. (1) All industrial departments must do everything possible to increase the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels, and vigorously conserve raw materials, materials, and fuels while ensuring quality; at the same time, they must strengthen the allocation of raw materials, materials, etc., strengthening the allocation of materials between cities and enterprises on the one hand, and strengthening the allocation of materials between urban and rural areas on the other, striving to purchase agricultural and sideline products, digging deeply into the material potential of society, and continuing to collect scrap iron and steel and other materials. (2) Do a good job in production balance, so that this year's production and next year's production are well connected. Don't just focus on completing this year's tasks, regardless of production in the first quarter of next year; there must be a certain amount of material reserves, with necessary work-in-progress and semi-finished products; products with long production cycles should be put into production early; coal mine tunneling and stripping should be done as much as possible this year, creating conditions for a "flying start" next year. (3) Do a good job in equipment maintenance. When the province worked hard in August and September, it had already repaired about 95% of the equipment that was out of repair, which was a great achievement. But we must continue to work hard. Most of the equipment that has not been repaired is large and important equipment, so we must pay special attention to repairing it. We must produce and reserve necessary spare parts; we must establish, improve and implement the equipment pre-inspection and repair system, so that the equipment can operate normally after entering next year. (4) Strengthen transportation work. The conference emphasized that this is an important key to whether production can develop at a high speed in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Transportation departments should actively improve the capacity of transportation equipment; concentrate necessary forces to do a good job in maintenance, and improve the integrity rate of vehicles; rush to produce various foreign and local transportation tools and parts and accessories; carry out mechanization and semi-mechanization movements, and strive to make significant achievements in a short period of time; continue to strengthen road-factory and road-mine cooperation, so that production and transportation are better connected; and continue to persist in the short-distance transportation movement that has already been launched, and repair all roads in urban and rural areas after the autumn harvest and before freezing. (5) We must seize the preparation of electricity, generate more electricity and save more electricity, and do a good job in equipment maintenance, especially to accelerate the construction of power stations. (6) Accelerate the construction of water source projects. (7) Make preparations for labor and technical forces. (8) Seize basic construction work. At present, we must first seize the construction of water source, power, coal, transportation and other projects, as well as some projects related to people's lives. We must also do a good job in the finishing work of various projects; do a good job in preparing for winter construction; and organize a large-scale collaboration in basic construction.

　　抓紧今年　准备明年　不断跃进
    辽宁省委及早部署明年第一季度工业生产任务
    本报沈阳15日电　中共辽宁省委最近召开工业会议，部署和安排了明年第一季度的工业生产任务。会议要求全省各工业部门和厂矿企业，大干第四季度，在保证提前和超额完成今年生产计划的同时，充分做好各项准备，夺取明年的“开门红”，力争一进入明年就使全省工业跨上新的高峰，保证明年第一季度生产水平不低于今年第四季度的水平，实现明年全年的继续大跃进。
    会议分析了目前全省工业战线的形势。由于贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的精神，反右倾，鼓干劲，全省工业战线发生了巨大的变化，群众运动逐浪高涨，生产建设情况步步上升。8月份全省工业总产值比7月份提高12％，9月份又比8月份增长了15.7％，一进入四季度又创造了10月“开门红”。目前工业战线的增产节约群众运动新高潮正在蓬勃发展，社会主义劳动竞赛热火朝天。根据这种非常有利的形势，会议认为，只要继续深入反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展社会主义劳动竞赛，特别是技术表演赛，抓紧做好各种具体的生产准备工作，充分挖掘各方面的潜力，调动各方面的积极因素，全省工业战线就一定能够提前十五天到二十天超额完成今年的计划。
    会议在研究和安排明年第一季度的工业生产任务时，贯彻和体现了工业积极支援农业的精神，要求农业机械、化学肥料和化学农药等产品的生产。有更大的增长。
    为了打破年初、季初生产水平低的“常规”，会议要求全省各有关部门从现在起就抓紧做好以下三个方面的准备工作。
    第一、做好思想准备，主要是把当前反右倾的整风运动搞深搞透，进一步用总路线把广大干部和群众的思想武装起来。会议指出，这次的整风运动，首先要整顿好干部的思想作风，还要在职工中开展社会主义教育。整风要和生产相结合，要以生产大跃进为中心来开展。整风要和改进企业管理相结合，把企业中残存的脱离党的领导和群众路线的作风、方法和制度等清除掉，进一步在企业中加强党的领导，贯彻执行群众路线。
    第二、在群众运动和企业管理方面的准备，就是要通过深入开展整风，继续大搞群众运动，使目前已经开展起来的群众运动，深入、广泛、持久地发展下去。要深入开展竞赛，特别是要广泛开展技术表演赛，促进运动更快地发展。在运动中要大搞技术革新和技术革命，使苦干、实干和巧干相结合。要加强企业管理，关心和搞好职工的生活，保证职工劳逸结合，有劳有逸，保证安全生产，做到政治思想工作和物质奖励相结合，从而使职工群众能够精力充沛，把干劲持久地保持下去。
    第三、关于物资技术方面的准备，必须从八个方面进行一系列的工作。（一）各工业部门必须千方百计地增产原料、材料和燃料，在保证质量的前提下，大力节约原料、材料、燃料；同时要加强原料、材料等的调剂工作，一方面加强各市、各企业间的物资调剂，另一方面要加强城乡的物资调剂，努力收购农副产品，大挖社会上的物资潜力，继续收集废钢铁及其他物资。（二）搞好生产均衡，使今年的生产和明年的生产很好地衔接起来。不要只顾突击完成今年的任务，不顾明年第一季度的生产；要有一定的物资储备，保有必要的在制品和半成品；生产周期长的产品要早投料；煤矿的掘进、剥离，今年要尽量争取多搞一些，给明年“开门红”创造条件。（三）搞好设备维修。全省大干8、9月时，已经把失修的设备修完了95％左右，成绩很大。但是还要继续努力，目前没有修好的设备大都是大型的重要的设备，因此更要特别抓紧修理。要生产和储备起必要的备品备件；要建立、健全和执行设备预检修制度，以便进入明年后设备都能正常运行。（四）加强交通运输工作。会议强调指出，这是今年四季度和明年一季度生产能否高速度发展的一个重要关键。运输部门要积极提高运输设备能力；要集中必要的力量搞好维修，提高车辆的完好率；要赶制各种洋的和土的交通工具以及零件、配件；要开展机械化和半机械化运动，争取在短期内作出显著成绩；继续加强路厂、路矿协作，使生产和运输更好地衔接；要把已经开展起来的短途运输运动坚持下去，并在秋收后和结冻前，把城乡所有的道路都修补好。（五）要抓紧电力的准备，要多发电多节电，搞好设备维修，尤其要加速电站建设。（六）要加速水源工程的建设。（七）要做好劳动力和技术力量的准备。（八）抓紧基本建设工作。当前首先要抓紧水源、电力、煤炭、交通运输等工程的建设，以及与人民生活有关的一些工程。还要做好各种工程的收尾工作；搞好冬季施工的准备工作，组织好基本建设的大协作。
