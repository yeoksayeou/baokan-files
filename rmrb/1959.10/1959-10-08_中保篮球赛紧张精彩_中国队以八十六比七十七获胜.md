Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The agile Chinese National Men's Basketball Team, after arduous battle, won a friendly match against the Bulgarian National Basketball Team tonight by a score of 86-77.

This was an extremely tense and exciting friendly match. Although the Chinese team led in scoring for most of the forty-minute game, the more than seven thousand spectators in the Beijing Gymnasium could not calm their excitement. Thunderous applause and cheers rose one after another, applauding the wonderful performance of the two teams.

Yang Boyong, the right forward of the Chinese team, performed very well tonight. Although Savov (No. 11), the Bulgarian team's shooter, marked him closely, he still displayed his unique and flexible layup skills and accurate shooting technique many times, becoming the highest-scoring player in the game (with a total of 29 points).

The Bulgarian team still adopted a very threatening offensive tactic of scoring through the center tonight. At the very beginning of the game, Tsvetkov (No. 13), who is 1.96 meters tall, scored a goal under the basket. Later, Ju Fenkang, Yang Boyong, Qian Chenghai, Wang Lifa and others from the Chinese team made free throws and shots in succession, taking the lead 14-8 by the fifth minute. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Bulgarian team immediately put Milchev (No. 5), the tallest center (2.01 meters), on the court. Milchev was extremely active under the basket, which increased the difficulty of the Chinese team's defense. The scores of the two sides began to approach, and the scores of the two teams rose in parallel. At the end of the first half, the Chinese team only led by five points with a score of 44-39.

In the second half, the Chinese team stepped up its defense against Milchev and the shooter Savov on the one hand, and did not reduce the speed of its offense on the other. The score began to increase again, and they once led by twelve points with a score of 52-40 and 53-41. After the Bulgarian team stubbornly counterattacked and once narrowed the gap to only two points, the Chinese team used man-to-man defense and zone defense at times, making it difficult for the guest team's center Tsvetkov to move under the basket. With just over five minutes left in the game, they replaced the newcomer Zhang Jingfu (No. 15), who was good at shooting and cutting layups, and he cut left and right under the basket to score. The Chinese team's offensive became more and more fierce, and finally won with a nine-point lead. After the game, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long and Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen met with the athletes of both sides. At this time, the audience applauded warmly, thanking the athletes of both sides for their wonderful performance. (Attached picture)

    中保篮球赛紧张精彩
    中国队以八十六比七十七获胜
    新华社7日讯　动作灵活的中国国家男子篮球队今晚经过艰苦奋战，在一场友谊比赛中以八十六比七十七战胜保加利亚国家篮球队。
    这是一场极为紧张、精彩的友谊比赛，尽管中国队在四十分钟的比赛过程中，绝大部分时间得分一直领先，但北京体育馆比赛馆里的七千多名观众心情始终不能平静，暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声一阵接着一阵，为两队队员的精彩表演喝采。
    中国队右锋杨伯镛今晚表演十分出色，保加利亚队的投篮能手萨沃夫（十一号）虽然盯他很紧，但他仍然多次施展了他那特有的灵活多变的切入上篮的本领和准确的投篮技术，成为全场得分最多的队员（共得了二十九分）。
    保加利亚队今晚仍然采用了极有威胁力的通过中锋得分的进攻战术，比赛才开始就由身高一米九六的茨维特科夫（十三号）在篮下投入一球。后来中国队鞠汾康、杨伯镛、钱澄海、王利发等人罚球、投篮接连命中，到第五分钟时就以十四比八领先。保加利亚队一看形势不妙，立刻把身材最高（两米零一）的中锋米尔契夫（五号）调上场。米尔契夫在篮下活动能力极强，增加了中国队的防守困难。双方比分开始接近，两队得分平行上升。上半场结束时，中国队只以四十四比三十九领先五分。
    下半场中国队一方面加紧防守米尔契夫和投篮能手萨沃夫，另一方面不减低进攻的速度，得分又开始多了起来，曾先后以五十二比四十、五十三比四十一领先十二分。保加利亚队顽强反攻一度追到只差两分以后，中国队一会儿人盯人防守，一会儿区域联防，使客队中锋茨维特科夫在篮下活动困难，并且在全场比赛还剩最后五分多钟时，换上了善于投篮和切入上篮的新手张景富（十五号），由他在篮下左右穿切投篮得分。中国队攻势越来越猛，最后终以领先九分的优势获胜。比赛结束后，国务院副总理贺龙和北京市市长彭真等接见了双方运动员，这时全场观众热烈鼓掌，感谢双方运动员的精彩表演。（附图片）
