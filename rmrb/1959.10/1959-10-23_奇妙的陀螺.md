    The Wonderful Top
    Wang Xieshan

    The top is an interesting children's toy, and everyone is familiar with it. In my hometown—Zhejiang—children call it "cheap camel," presumably because this toy spins faster and more joyfully the more it is whipped, hence this affectionate name.

    Unexpectedly, the history of the top is very ancient! More than thirty years ago, someone excavated this toy from the Neolithic Age (about four to five thousand years ago) ruins in Xia County, Shanxi. It was made of pottery. This pottery top can be said to be the ancestor of the popular top today.

    In these thousands of years, the top has spun in the hands of children for countless springs and autumns, bringing joy to generations of children.... However, only modern technology can truly appreciate its talent and give it an extremely important role to play.

    The top has a wonderful characteristic: when it is spinning rapidly, its axis of rotation tries its best to maintain its direction unchanged. This is because when the top is spinning, each point, due to inertia, wants to keep itself moving in a plane perpendicular to the rotation. Therefore, the axis of rotation of the top itself also tries its best to maintain its direction. It is precisely for this reason that the top does not fall down when it is spinning rapidly. It is also this characteristic that has caused people to look at it with new eyes.

    In guns and cannons, people use this principle to engrave spiral lines (rifling) on the inner walls of gun barrels and cannon tubes in order to make the bullets or shells rotate around their own axis during flight, so that they, like tops, always maintain the correct direction of flight, and will not change direction or somersault due to air resistance.

    In navigation and aviation, older compasses were made with magnetic needles. Magnetic compasses have many shortcomings. First, because the magnetic poles deviate from the geographic north and south poles, they do not point to the true south; second, the magnetic needle is often affected by ironware and magnetic storms and becomes ineffective. So people thought of using the characteristics of the top to make a compass. The main part of this compass is a wheel (top) with a large mass on its edge. The top floats in a container filled with mercury and spins rapidly, reaching a speed of 30,000 revolutions per minute. Due to the Earth's rotation, the axis of the top can always be parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation, that is, it always points to the north and south directions of the Earth.

    In rockets and missiles, people call the gyroscope the "sensory organ." Because when the flight direction of a rocket or missile deviates for some reason, the gyroscope, which maintains the original direction, will detect this deviation. Its role is equivalent to the sensory organs on the human body. Generally, three extremely precise gyroscopes are installed on the rocket, managing the three directions of movement. Once an unexpected change occurs, the gyroscope will detect it and send a signal to slightly change the direction of the rocket's jet, or to make a dedicated small rocket attached to it spray, so that the rocket maintains flight along the predetermined route.

    奇妙的陀螺
    王燮山
    陀螺是一种有趣的儿童玩具，大家对它都很熟悉。我们家乡——浙江的孩子们，把它叫做“贱骆驼”，想必是因为这种玩意儿越鞭打越转得快转得欢的缘故，才有这样的带有亲昵意味的称呼。
    想不到陀螺的历史竟是非常古老的！三十多年前有人从山西夏县的新石器时代（距今约有四、五千年）的遗址中发掘到这个玩意儿，是用陶土做的。这个陶制的陀螺可以说是现在流行的陀螺的老祖宗了。
    在这几千年中，陀螺在儿童们的手中，旋转过了多少个春秋，它给多少代的儿童带来了欢乐……。然而，只有近代技术才能够真正赏识它的才能，给它扮演极其重要的角色。
    陀螺有一个奇妙的特性，就是当在急速转动时，它的转动轴要竭力维持自己的方向不变。这是因为当陀螺在转动时，每一个点由于惯性的缘故都要使自己保持在和旋转垂直的平面内运动，因此陀螺的旋转轴的本身也就竭力维持自己的方向。正是这样的原因，陀螺在急速地旋转时，才不会倒下来。也正是这个特性，引起了人们的另眼看待。
    在枪炮中，人们利用这个原理把枪管和炮筒的内壁刻上螺旋线（来复线），为的是使枪弹或炮弹在飞行时，能绕着它们本身的轴线回转，使它们和陀螺一样，始终保持飞行的正确方向，不至于因受空气阻力而改变方向或倒翻跟斗。
    在航海和航空上，较老的罗盘都是用磁针做的。磁罗盘是有很多缺点的，首先是因为磁极和地理南北极有偏差，它并不指着真正的南方；其次是磁针常受铁器、磁暴的影响而失灵。于是人们就想到了利用陀螺的特性来制造罗盘。这种罗盘主要部分是一个边缘具有很大质量的轮子（陀螺）。陀螺浮在一个盛有水银的容器中，迅速地转动着，它的转速达到每分钟三万转。由于地球自转的关系，陀螺的轴线始终能和地球的自转轴线平行，也就是它始终指着地球的南北方向。
    在火箭和导弹中，人们把陀螺仪称呼为“感觉器官”。因为当火箭或导弹的飞行方向由于某种原因发生偏差的时候，保持原来方向的陀螺仪就会察觉出这种偏差，它的作用相当于人身上的感觉器官。一般在火箭上装有三个极其精密的陀螺仪，管理着运动的三个方向。一旦发生意外的变动，陀螺仪就会察觉出来，发出讯号使火箭的喷气方向稍稍改变，或者使附带的专用小火箭喷射，使火箭保持沿预定的航线飞行。
