    Spending Old Age in a Nursing Home
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    In the crisp autumn season, on an evening after the rain, I took a public bus to Tongzhou, which is forty miles from Beijing.
    Passing through a lush green estate, I saw a wide wall in the distance, and a white-painted wooden sign reading "Tongzhou Town People's Commune Nursing Home" hanging next to a vermilion gate. Several elderly people were sitting peacefully on the steps at the entrance, chatting. As soon as I greeted them with "Hello, old ladies, old men!" several of them immediately stood up warmly to welcome me.
    This is a spacious courtyard. Stepping through the gate, you are greeted by a tall apricot tree and a jujube tree full of fruit. The brightly colored lantanas planted by the old people themselves in the yard were blooming beautifully. The courtyard was kept exceptionally clean everywhere. Comrade Feng Shuzhang, the director of the nursing home, led me around to visit various places. There are thirty-seven spacious and bright rooms and three courtyards. In front of the courtyard gate is a garden planted with onions, eggplants, tomatoes, tobacco, and grape trellises. This nursing home was established last year during the upsurge of the mass establishment of people's communes. It is a collective welfare undertaking organized by the people's commune. So far, this happy paradise for the elderly has taken in forty-three "five-guarantee" elderly people. The oldest of them is eighty-six years old, and the average age is over seventy. Some of them are disabled, including some blind, deaf, mute, and hemiplegic elderly people. Most of these old people in their twilight years are lonely and helpless people with no children or family to rely on. In the old society, they were a group of abandoned old people. In their own words, "We toiled hard for decades, suffered endlessly, ate chaff and vegetable leaves, and ended up empty-handed in our old age." They never dreamed that they would have today, living in such a place and spending their happy old age.
    Spacious and bright rooms, snow-white walls, newly built warm brick beds, and bright large glass windows, as well as new cotton quilts and floral mattresses, all filled the old people's hearts with indescribable joy, excitement, and emotion. They are now truly beginning to live a carefree life with the warmth of a home. Chen Yusheng, a disabled man with crippled legs and deafness, talked about the night he first arrived at the nursing home, saying he tossed and turned, too excited to sleep. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, he couldn't quite believe it himself. But turning on the light, touching the warm bed, looking at this and looking at that, wasn't it all real! He couldn't help but shed tears. These old people mostly have bitter experiences. Kong, an old lady with white hair at seventy-seven years old, had five sons and two daughters in her decades of marriage, but the hardships of life and the torment of poverty and illness in the old society caused her beloved children to die one after another. What made her feel most painful and unfortunate was that in an epidemic of scarlet fever, because she had no money for treatment, she watched helplessly as the disease took the lives of three of her children in a row. The tragic scene of her children dying still remains in her mind. Poor woman, she had just buried her children's bodies, and soon after, her husband also fell ill due to the hardships of life and finally left her alone. In those lonely days soaked in tears, grief drove her to the point of wanting to die. But after the liberation of Tongzhou, she received care and relief from the People's Government. Last year, she was welcomed into the People's Commune Nursing Home, living in a warm big family. The kind care of the leaders of the nursing home and the old sisters living together gradually brightened her mood. The new life made her no longer feel the loneliness and sadness of losing her family. With tears of joy, she said to me, "Comrade, if it weren't for the new society led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have this today? Like many old people in the nursing home, we used to long for death in the old society, but now we want to live a few more years!"
    The night I arrived at the nursing home, I stayed there. In the evening, several old people enthusiastically invited me to visit their rooms. Whether it was the old lady who had just had a five-and-a-half-jin tumor removed from the hospital, the eighty-year-old Li Wenbin who had fed sows for thirty years, the old monk Jiang Rensen who came from a temple, the old man Xu Zhensheng who had been captured by the Japanese as a laborer, or the old man Wang Ruilin who used to be a beggar and now takes care of the garden in the nursing home..., they all had endless stories to tell, telling me about their carefree and happy life in the People's Commune Nursing Home today. Wang Liang, a seventy-six-year-old mute old man, enthusiastically gestured to me constantly, but unfortunately I couldn't understand what he wanted to tell me, but from his wrinkled and smiling face, I deeply felt that he wanted to tell me about his happy old age. An old man even read a poem he had written to describe his mood:
    Now a nursing home is established, the widowed and lonely have a support,
    In the past, we longed for death, but now we fear it, spending our old age in the nursing home,
    Living together as one family, the old people's enthusiasm is greater than the sky,
    Resolutely following the Communist Party, even old people want to blossom red flowers.
    Early in the morning, before dawn, I heard the old people getting up. I opened the curtains and saw some watering flowers, some cleaning the courtyard, some taking a walk, some smoking, each looking peaceful, calm, and leisurely. When the morning sun rose, all the old people in the courtyard got up, each with a look of joy on their faces, and bursts of laughter flew all over the courtyard with the morning breeze.
    A bell rang, it turned out to be time for breakfast.
    In the dining hall, bowls of steaming white rice were placed in front of the old people. Each table had three plates of rich fresh vegetables: braised eggplant, fried potatoes, and scrambled tomatoes with peppers. Each person also had a bowl of hot soup. Eight people sat at a table, filling more than half of the dining hall. Every old person's face showed a happy smile. They ate heartily, and the old sisters and brothers were polite to each other! What a happy and warm big family this is! Several old people excitedly told me that they couldn't even afford such fine white rice and fresh vegetables during the New Year in the past! If the People's Commune hadn't been established and brought a great harvest, how could these old people who had suffered all their lives enjoy this blessing! An old man later told me with tears that whenever he ate and saw a table full of rich dishes, he would think of the tragic scene when he was fleeing famine in the past. A few days ago, an old neighbor from the village came to see him and talked about how, although the village had suffered from floods this year, no household went hungry. The flood drainage army organized by the People's Commune not only rescued the crops in time, but also rescued the affected commune members. Now, in the years of natural disasters, he is carefree in the nursing home, how could he not be moved!
    After eating, some old people went back to their rooms to rest on the brick beds, some lit up a pipe and smoked leisurely, and some went for a walk in the garden. I was warmly pulled by several old ladies to sit in their rooms. The old ladies lived in the spacious east and west wing rooms on both sides of the courtyard, while the old men lived in the north and south rooms. The sunlight shone through the large glass windows, making the room bright and clear. Along the large glass windows was a row of warm brick beds, covered with the clean and new floral bedding distributed by the nursing home. An old lady pointed to another tall and slender old lady dressed neatly and cleanly and said, "Look, she and her old man live in that room as an old couple!" I lifted the curtain and went in to see that the old couple had neatly made their bed, and a small square table was also wiped clean. Several calligraphy and paintings given to the old people by the masses were hung on the white walls. The old lady told me that her old man was called Liu Xiang, and they were both in their seventies this year. The old couple entered the nursing home together. In the past, they had lived a hard life for decades, sometimes hungry and sometimes full. Their son died of illness, and they relied on the old man to carry water for others to make a living. Now that they have entered the nursing home together, they no longer worry about life. An old lady standing aside jokingly said, "Since this old couple entered the nursing home, even their looks have become better!"
    In a spacious recreational activity room, there were chess, picture books, newspapers, and some magazines and books. The four walls were full of many gifts given to the old people in the nursing home by people who came to visit, and poems praising the old people's happy old age. I was about to sit down and take a closer look when suddenly there was a burst of hearty laughter from the old people and women in the courtyard. It turned out that some relatives of the old ladies and old men had come to see them with their babies. Comrade Wang from the commune's welfare department told me that when some old people first came to the nursing home, they were still worried that they would not be free after entering the nursing home and would not be able to see those distant relatives and neighbors who had been together for many years. Some were afraid that the old couple would not be able to live together in the nursing home. But after living there for a few days, not only did they get rid of these concerns, but they also deeply fell in love with this new home from the bottom of their hearts. Sometimes on Sunday mornings, after eating a full meal, the old ladies would also go back to see their old neighbors in the donkey cart borrowed from the commune in groups. When they met, they would always tell them about the good life in the nursing home. When they came back, they would always think of giving the little treats their neighbors gave them to the old sisters living with them in the nursing home to eat together.
    The old people in the nursing home all came from the working people. They had developed a good physique and good habits of labor through long-term hard work. Although they are old, they refuse to admit it. Zhou Yulong, an eighty-two-year-old cobbler, carried his cobbler's tools into the nursing home. In order to increase the income of the nursing home and let people wear refurbished shoes, he asked the nursing home to let him continue to do some cobbler work. In this way, in addition to the pocket money given to him by the nursing home, he can also have some extra pocket money. Near the nursing home, people can often see him sitting under the shade of a tree, mending old shoes for the masses. If anyone wants him to rest, he will argue with you for a few words! Gu, an old man of seventy-three who made a living by sharpening knives, spent decades of lonely years in Tongzhou. Just before he entered the nursing home, he was still carrying his only whetstone and bench and shouting along the street. After coming to the nursing home, he never rested for a while and always scrambled to carry water for the nursing home to use from morning to night. The leaders of the nursing home wanted him to rest more, but he always answered with a smile, "What is it to do this little bit of work! Now there is food and drink in the nursing home, and the worries of the day are gone. I still have the strength, can I be idle and eat and drink for nothing?"
    When the old people in the nursing home have nothing to do, they also raise many pigs, chickens, and rabbits. Many old people also automatically organize to participate in the sideline production of processing Chinese medicinal materials (brushing the hairs on loquat leaves)! These old people's physical labor within their capabilities has now become a kind of fun in their lives. As long as they can do something, everyone is unwilling to be idle and always wants to do something for the nursing home to increase their income.
    The collective life in the nursing home has also fostered the old people's mutual care, consideration, unity, and friendship. An eighty-five-year-old lady is blind, and the old ladies living in the same room with her automatically take turns to bring her food and carry her stool and urine, and also tell her about the new changes in society and the new atmosphere in the motherland.
    In winter, when the outdoors are covered with ice and snow and the severe cold arrives, the nursing home adds cotton clothes for the old people early, and lights up the stoves and warm brick beds. When an old person is seriously ill, they are immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. After three elderly people died of illness last winter and this spring, the nursing home cremated them all and packed their ashes.
    The people in the commune are very concerned about this nursing home and come to see it whenever they pass by.

    Although the nursing home has arranged a happy life for the old people, the old people are still unwilling to be idle all day long, and they often take the initiative to find some light work to do.

    敬老院里度晚年
    本报记者　柏生
    清秋时节，一个雨后的黄昏，我搭公共汽车来到了离北京城四十里路的通州。
    穿过一片葱绿的庄园，远远地就望到了一片宽阔的围墙，一座朱红大门旁挂着“通州镇人民公社敬老院”的白漆木牌。几位老人正安祥地坐在门口的台阶上聊天。我刚问候了一声“老大妈，老大爷好！”几位老大妈和老大爷就立刻亲热地站起身来欢迎我。
    这是一座宽阔的庭院。跨进院门，迎面有一株高大的杏树和一株结满了果实的枣树。院里老人们自己栽种的鲜艳的五色梅开得正娇妍。庭院里四处都打扫得异常整洁。敬老院的院长冯书章同志领我到院里各处参观了一番。这里共有三十七间宽大敞亮的房屋，和三个庭院。院门前是一片种着葱、茄子、西红柿、烟叶和搭着葡萄架的园子。去年全民大办人民公社的高潮中，这座敬老院便兴办起来了。它是人民公社举办的一项集体福利事业。到现在这座老人的幸福乐园，已收容了四十三位“五保”老人。他们中年纪最大的已有八十六岁，平均年龄也在七十岁以上，其中还有些是有残疾的，有几个瞎子、聋子、哑吧和半身不遂的老人。这些风烛残年的老人，大部都是无儿无女，无家可归的孤苦伶仃的人。在旧社会他们是一群被遗弃的老人，用他们自己的话来形容：“饥苦劳碌几十年，受苦受罪说不完，吃糠咽菜拼命干，年老闹个赤手空拳。”他们真是做梦也没有想到自己会有今天，能住到这样的地方来渡着幸福的晚年。
    宽大敞亮的房屋，雪白的粉墙，新砌的暖炕和明净的大玻璃窗，还有那一床床新絮的棉被花褥，这一切都使老人心里感到有说不出来的喜悦、激动和感慨。他们现在才真正开始过着无忧无虑有家的温暖生活。一个叫陈雨生的双腿有残疾、耳聋的残废者谈起他刚来到敬老院的那天晚上，简直翻来复去，兴奋得怎么也睡不着，想着过去，看看眼前，真有点不敢相信自己，可是开开电灯，摸摸热炕，看看这，望望那，不都是真的么！自己止不住就流下了眼泪。这些老人大都有一番辛酸的经历。白发苍苍七十七岁的孔老大妈，从十七岁结了婚，几十年中一共生了五个男孩两个女孩，但旧社会的苦难生活和贫病的折磨，使她心爱的孩子们竟一个个都相继死去。最使她感到痛苦和不幸的是，在一场猩红热病中，因无钱治病，她眼见着病魔一连夺去了她三个孩子的生命。孩子临死时的凄惨情景，至今仍留在她的脑中。可怜她刚掩埋了孩子的尸体，不久，丈夫也因生活的折磨一病不起，最后丢下她孤伶伶的一个人。在那泪水浸湿的孤苦日子中，悲痛使她曾经发狂得想死去。可是通州解放后，她受到人民政府的关怀和救济。去年她被欢迎入人民公社敬老院来以后，生活在温暖的大家庭中，院里领导上和同住一起的老姐妹对她的亲切关怀，使她心情变得逐渐开朗起来。新的生活使她再不感到失去家庭的寂寞悲伤了。她含着欣喜的眼泪对我说：“同志，要不是赶上共产党毛主席领导的新社会，我能有今天么，我和院里许多老人一样，旧社会盼早死，如今却想能多活上几年呢！”
    来到敬老院的那晚，我就在院里住了下来。晚上，好几位老人热情地要我到他们房里去看看，去坐坐。无论是那刚刚从医院割过一个五斤半肉瘤的老大妈，还是那喂了三十年母猪的八十岁老人李文斌，还是那从庙里来的出家老人姜仁僧，还是那曾经被日本人抓去做劳工的老人许振生，和讨饭出身、现在看管院里园子的老人王瑞林……，他们都有说不尽的话语，向我道出他们今天生活在人民公社敬老院里的无忧无虑的幸福生活。七十六岁的哑吧老人王梁，热情地用手不断向我比划着，可惜我不能明白他想要对我诉说什么，但从他那皱纹舒展不时微笑的面庞上，我深深地感到他是想对我诉说他幸福的晚年。一位老人还读了一首自己作的诗来描述他的心情：
    如今建立敬老院，鳏寡孤独有靠山，
    过去盼死今怕死，敬老院里渡晚年，
    异姓同居是一家，老人干劲比天大，
    坚决跟着共产党，人老也要开红花。
    清早，天还没大亮，我就听到老人们起身了。我把窗帘拉开一看，有的正在浇花，有的在打扫庭院，有的在散步，有的在吸烟，个个神气安祥，悠闲自得。当朝阳升起时，全院的老人们都起身了，每个人面容上都浮着生活的欢欣，一阵阵笑语声随着晨风飞遍满院。
    一阵铃声，原来是开早饭了。
    饭厅里，一碗碗热气腾腾的大米饭，摆在老人面前。每个桌上都有三盘丰盛的鲜菜：烧茄子，炒土豆，西红柿炒辣椒，每人还盛了一碗热汤。八个人一桌，整整坐满了大半个饭厅。每个老人的脸上都流露出幸福的微笑。他们吃得很香，老姐妹老兄弟们彼此还互相谦让着呢！这是个多么幸福温暖的大家庭呵！好几位老人都满怀着兴奋而又激动的心情告诉我，这样细白的大米饭和新鲜蔬菜，那是他们过去过年过节时也吃不上的呵！要不是如今建立了人民公社，带来了大丰收，他们这些苦了一辈子的老人，那里能享到这个福呢！一位老人后来含着泪感慨地告诉我，每当他吃饭时看到满桌丰盛的菜饭，就想起他过去逃荒时的悲惨情景来。前些天村里一个老邻居来看他，谈起今年大雨中，村里虽然遭受了水灾，但却没有一户人家挨饿，人民公社组织的排涝大军不仅及时抢救了庄稼，也救护了受灾的社员们。如今在遭天灾的年月里，他却在敬老院里无忧无虑，这怎能使他不感动呢！
    吃完饭，有的老人回屋炕上歇着去了，有的点起了一袋旱烟悠闲地抽着，有的到园子里散步去了。我被几个老大妈热情地拉到她们房间里去坐。老大妈们住的是院里两边宽敞的东西厢房，南北房是老大爷们住着。阳光透过大玻璃窗，照得屋里豁亮亮的，沿着大玻璃窗前是一排暖炕，炕上铺着院里发给她们的整洁簇新的花被褥。一个老大妈指着另一个身材瘦长，全身穿得干净俐落的老大妈说：“看，那边房里是她和她老伴老两口住的呢！”我掀起门帘进去一看，老两口炕上铺得整整齐齐，一张小方桌也擦得精亮，洁白的壁上还挂上了几幅群众送给老人的字画。老大妈告诉我，她的老伴叫刘祥，他们俩今年都七十多岁了。老俩口是一起进敬老院的。过去他们饥一顿饱一顿的过了几十年的苦日子，儿子生病死了，就靠老头给人挑水过活。现在他们一同进了敬老院再也不为生活耽忧了。站在一旁的一位老大妈打趣地说：“这老俩口儿自从进了敬老院，连模样儿也变得好看了呢！”
    在一间宽大的文娱活动室里，放着象棋、小人书、报纸和一些杂志书籍，四壁挂满了来院参观的人们送给敬老院老人们的许多礼品，和赞颂老人们幸福晚年生活的诗篇。我刚想坐下来看个仔细，忽然院里传来一阵老人和妇女们爽朗的谈笑声，原来是几位老大妈、老大爷的亲戚抱着娃儿们来看老人们来了。公社福利部的汪同志告诉我，有些老人初来敬老院时，还耽心着进院后会不自由了，看不到那些多年在一起的远亲近邻了，有的怕老俩口进院不能住到一起。可是没住上几天，他们不但这些思想顾虑都没有了，而且从心眼里深深地爱上了这个新家。老大妈们有时星期天早上吃饱了饭，还结伴儿坐上院里从公社借来的那辆毛驴大车回去看看老邻居们，见面后总是向她们数落着敬老院里的好生活，回来时，邻居们送给她们的一点好吃的，也总是想着拿给院里同住的老姐妹们一起吃。
    敬老院里的老人，都是劳动人民出身。他们在长期的辛勤劳动中，锻炼了一副好筋骨，也养成了劳动的好习惯。虽然老了，可是不服老。皮匠出身的八十二岁老人周玉龙，连皮匠担子一起担进了敬老院。为了给院里增加些收入，让人们穿着返旧更新的鞋子，他要求院里让他继续做点皮匠活儿。这样，他自己除了院里发的一点零花钱外，还能多有几个零花钱。在敬老院的附近，人们经常可以看到他坐在树荫下，为群众缝补着旧鞋。谁要让他休息，他还要和你嚷嚷几句呢！七十三岁的老顾生，以磨刀为生，在通州渡过了几十年漫长的孤苦岁月。就在他入敬老院前，仍是扛着那条仅有的磨刀石和板凳沿街叫喊。来到敬老院以后，他从不肯多休息一会，每天总是从早到晚抢着挑水供院里用。院里领导上要他多歇息，他却总是笑着回答说：“我干这点子活又算得什么呢！如今敬老院里有吃有喝，一天愁云都散了，我还有力气，能闲下来白吃白喝吗？”
    院里的老人们闲着没事，自己还喂养了许多猪、鸡和兔子，许多老人还自动组织起来参加了中药材的加工（刷枇杷叶子上的毛）的副业生产呢！这些老人们力所能及的体力劳动，如今都已成为他们生活中的一种乐趣了，只要他们谁能做一点什么事，大家都不愿意闲着，总想能为院里搞点什么生产，多增加些收入。
    敬老院的集体生活，也养成了老人们的互相关怀体贴，团结友爱。一位八十五岁的老大妈双目失明，和她住同屋的老大妈们便自动地轮流给她打饭、端屎尿，还把社会上的新变化，祖国的新气象，一一讲给她听。
    冬天，当户外盖满冰雪，严寒降临的时候，院里早为老人们添加了棉衣，升起了炉火和暖炕。老人生重病时，便立刻送他们到医院去治疗。去冬今春有三位年迈老人病故后，院里都为他们进行了火葬，装殓了骨灰。
    公社里的人们，都十分关怀着这个敬老院，时时顺路来看看。（附图片）
