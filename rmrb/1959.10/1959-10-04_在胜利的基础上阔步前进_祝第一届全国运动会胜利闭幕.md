March Forward on the Basis of Victory
— A Congratulatory Message on the Successful Closing of the First National Games

The magnificent First National Games has come to a successful conclusion. While the national industrial and agricultural production fronts presented the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation with great leap forward achievements, more than 10,000 outstanding athletes and sports workers across the country also created an unprecedented "large-scale harvest" in the National Games for China's sports cause. During the competition, seven athletes created four world records, more than six hundred athletes broke national records more than eight hundred times, and thousands of athletes broke the highest records of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. At the same time, a large number of young athletes and outstanding collectives emerged, catching up with or surpassing advanced athletes and units at a flying speed, with new talents emerging in abundance, which is a huge success of the National Games; it is the victory of the Party's policy of developing mass sports activities and the victory of China's superior socialist system. This is worthy of congratulation from the people of the whole country to all athletes and sports workers who participated in the National Games. Sports delegations from fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union and friends from other countries also participated in the Games, bringing fraternal concern and encouragement. We would like to express our gratitude and respect to them.
The First National Games fully demonstrates that China's sports level has been greatly improved. Its great significance lies in providing extremely rich experience for the further development of China's sports cause. It proves that the Party's General Line is not only applicable to the industrial and agricultural production fronts, but also to the sports cause. Throughout the National Games, people were competing with soaring enthusiasm under the encouragement of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. We know that sports competition is, of course, a contest of technical levels, which includes technical proficiency, physical strength, effective guidance, and competition experience, all of which are the basis for creating good results. However, these technical foundations are all governed by people's political thoughts and spiritual will. Political thought is always the soul and the commander. Without putting politics in command and going all out, it would be impossible to achieve brilliant achievements. Therefore, the Party organizations of the twenty-nine provincial and municipal delegations in this National Games all put politics in command and uninterrupted ideological work in the first place. On the one hand, they constantly praised the advanced, established role models, and encouraged people to move forward; on the other hand, they carried out timely criticism against complacency or complacency after achieving some victories, as well as the constantly exposed "regional backwardness theory," "others are strong, our foundation is poor, we can't compare at all," and other various conservative ideas, so that the athletes were liberated from the shackles of these conservative ideas and fully developed their technical level with high morale and soaring enthusiasm, gaining wisdom in each game and making progress in each competition, and creating excellent results. Facts have proved that the Party's General Line is the soul of success, and the Party's leadership and political ideological work are the fundamental conditions for achieving brilliant achievements.
The important significance of this National Games also lies in the fact that it has given people the most vivid lesson in ideological liberation. In our country, sports, like other things, are constantly advancing, constantly innovating, and constantly developing. In the process of developing and advancing, the advanced and the backward, the strong and the weak are not absolute, but often change with whether people's minds are liberated and whether subjective initiative is fully utilized. The advanced and strong can of course maintain their advanced and superior position, as is the case with the players from Beijing and the People's Liberation Army and many other units. However, the advanced and strong can also be transformed into the intermediate or backward, and even be defeated by the "weak." On the contrary, the intermediate and backward can be transformed into the advanced through diligent study and hard training, creating conditions. This is the situation that has appeared in large numbers in this National Games, such as the Sichuan men's basketball team, the Guizhou and Yunnan basketball and volleyball teams, the Guangdong football team, the women's table tennis singles champion Hu Kemin, the diving champion Zhou Xiyang, and some ethnic minority players such as Yitao from Inner Mongolia and Zaxi Mao from Tibet, who broke national records, all illustrate this truth. Whether the advanced still maintain their advanced status or are transformed into the intermediate, or the intermediate and backward are transformed into the advanced, a certain level of technical skill is generally required as a basis. However, if we implement putting politics in command, liberating our minds, going all out, and striving for the top, then they will be able to completely break down conservative ideas, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and achieve excellent results in the competition. After this National Games, no one dares to declare themselves advanced and think that they don't need to work hard in the future and others can't catch up. At the same time, no one will use reasons such as "regional backwardness" as the main factor in measuring the low level of sports. This is the most far-reaching gain in this National Games.
The experience of this National Games also proves that if people want to win in the competition and achieve the top ranking, they must combine soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of scientific analysis. Because only by combining the two can their subjective understanding conform to the objective laws of reality to the greatest extent, and can they achieve the expected results. In the competition, many athletes and their leaders and coaches have demonstrated both technical skills and political minds. They put the needs of the Party and the people first, put forward the political slogan of creating good results to celebrate the National Day, and have the revolutionary heroic spirit of letting mountains bow their heads and rivers make way during the competition. They are brave and tenacious, overcome difficulties, are indomitable, and fully develop their technical characteristics. At the same time, they also made a calm and scientific analysis of the competition situation, thereby winning the victory. For example, in the preliminary rounds of the ball games, the Sichuan men's basketball team defeated Beijing, the Jiangxi women's volleyball team defeated the People's Liberation Army team, and the Guangdong football team defeated the Liaoning, Shanghai, and other teams in a row. All of these were due to sufficient enthusiasm, high confidence, breaking the superstition of strong teams, scientifically analyzing the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, and formulating appropriate countermeasures, thereby achieving victory. If they were discouraged in front of the strong teams in advance, softened in half, and lost their courage and lacked enthusiasm, then it would be impossible to achieve victory. Similarly, some people are easily arrogant when they win and easily discouraged when they lose, and as a result, they cannot create good results.
It can be seen that the National Games is not just a competition of technical levels, but a comprehensive competition of political and ideological levels and technical levels. The decisive factor for victory is not one, but the sum of all factors led by political ideology. In the future, we will often hold various competitions, and these experiences are useful.
The purpose of holding this National Games is to review the achievements of China's sports development in the past ten years. The results show that what we have gained is a great improvement in the political and ideological level and technical level of China's sports, and the entire sports front has achieved a large-scale harvest. Of course, sports competitions always have to be ranked in order, but both the individuals and units in the front, and even the last ones, have improved compared to the past. What is especially valuable is that all the players and units have gained rich experience. At the same time, in this conference, everyone raced against time and did not give up an inch of merit to strive for victory and good rankings, which is also correct. Without this, we cannot fully demonstrate the high level that China's sports has reached, and we cannot measure the advanced and the general at a higher level. However, our competition is fundamentally different from the capitalist countries that regard winning championships as the sole purpose of the Games. We want to find out the champion, runner-up, third, fourth, etc. through competition, establish the advanced, in order to drive and encourage the general to catch up with the advanced, and make the advanced even more advanced. At the same time, our purpose of competing for championships and establishing the advanced is to improve together and learn from each other, in order to further develop mass sports activities, enhance people's physical fitness, and serve production and national defense construction, and serve socialist construction. Therefore, all sports backbone forces should continue to work hard on the basis of the victory of the National Games, and improve themselves faster, so that they can better drive and encourage the development of mass sports activities. This is also to improve sports work on the basis of popularization, and to popularize under the guidance of improvement. The current situation is very good. The facts of the National Games have further liberated people's minds, and there is a sports backbone force with a considerable level and relentlessly demanding progress, and the broad masses of people also love sports very much. This is a great opportunity to vigorously develop mass sports. Therefore, the holding of this National Games should be regarded as a new starting point for further developing mass sports activities. Of course, when further carrying out sports activities among the masses, we must also prevent the kind of "sports supremacy" that regards sports as being divorced from national politics and production construction, and regards it as being higher than industrial and agricultural production. This kind of thinking is a reflection of bourgeois views on sports work, and it is unacceptable. However, we cannot agree with some people who oppose production and sports, and think that if we engage in production, we cannot carry out sports, otherwise it will delay production. Because countless facts have proved that whether in factories, communes, organs, or schools, the masses have a strong desire to carry out sports activities, and they are fully capable of carrying out this activity without hindering production and work, and doing this work well will greatly benefit production. We hope that this sports backbone force in our country can be fully utilized in all places. On the one hand, continue to improve, and at the same time, according to the local specific circumstances, organize the masses to carry out various sports activities suitable for their requirements under the principle of serving production construction, so that everyone can exercise their bodies like steel, be full of energy, be happy, and contribute more to the socialist cause.

    在胜利的基础上阔步前进
    ——祝第一届全国运动会胜利闭幕
    绚烂多彩的第一届全国运动会胜利闭幕了。在全国工农业生产战线以大跃进的厚礼献给建国十周年的同时，全国一万多名优秀运动员和体育工作者也在全运会上为我国的体育事业创造了空前未有的“大面积丰收”成绩。在竞赛中有七名运动员创造了四项世界纪录，有六百多名运动员八百多次突破了全国纪录，几千名运动员打破了省、市和自治区的最高成绩。与此同时，出现了大量的青年选手和优秀集体，以飞跃的速度赶上或超过了先进的运动员和单位，新人辈出，万紫千红，这是全运会的巨大成功；是党的发展群众性体育运动的方针的胜利，是我国优越的社会主义制度的胜利。这是值得全国人民向参加全运会的全体运动员和体育工作者祝贺的。以苏联为首的兄弟国家的体育代表团和其它国家的朋友们，也参加了这次运动会，他们带来了兄弟般的关切和鼓励，我们谨向他们表示感谢和敬意。
    第一届全运会充分表明，我国运动水平已经大大提高。它的重大意义在于为我国体育事业的进一步发展提供了极其丰富的经验。它证明了党的总路线不仅适用于工农业生产战线，同样也适用于体育事业。整个全运会期间，人们都是在党的八中全会决议鼓舞下，以冲天干劲进行着比赛。我们知道，运动竞赛，固然是技术水平的较量，这里包括着技术熟练、体力健强、指导得法、以及比赛经验等，都是创造好成绩的基础，但是，这些技术基础都是受人们的政治思想和精神意志所支配的。政治思想始终是灵魂，是统帅。如果没有政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，就不可能取得光辉的成就。因此，这次全运会的二十九个省、市代表队的党组织都把政治挂帅和不间断的思想工作摆在第一位。一方面不断表扬先进，树立标兵，鼓舞人们前进；另方面又针对着骄傲自满或在取得一些胜利之后麻痹松懈，以及不断暴露出来的“地区落后论”，“人家是强手，我们基础差，根本比不过”等形形色色的保守思想进行了及时的批判，才使运动员们在这些保守思想的束缚下解放出来，以昂扬的意志和冲天的干劲充分发挥了技术水平，比一场长一智，赛一次进一步，创造了优异成绩。事实证明，党的总路线是成功的灵魂，党的领导和政治思想工作是取得光辉成就的根本条件。
    这次全运会的重要意义还在于它给人们上了思想解放的最生动的一课，在我们国家里，体育运动也像其它事物一样是在不断前进，不断革新，不断发展着的。在发展着的前进运动过程中，先进和落后，强和弱并不是绝对的，而是往往随着人们的思想是否解放，主观能动性是否充分发挥而发生变化的。先进的、强的当然可以保持先进的和优越的地位，像北京和解放军等许多单位的选手就是这样。但先进的、强的也会转化为中间的或落后的，甚至被“弱”者所战胜。相反，中间的和落后的，经过勤学苦练，创造条件，可以转化为先进，这是这次全运会中大量出现的情况，像四川男子篮球队，贵州和云南的篮、排球队，广东足球队，女子乒乓球单打冠军胡克明，跳水冠军周希洋，以及内蒙古的伊套、藏族选手扎西毛来等一些少数民族选手突破全国纪录，都说明了这一真理。无论先进仍然保持先进或转化中间，中间和落后转化为先进，一般都需要有技术水平作基础，但是如果实行政治挂帅，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，那末，他们也就能够彻底破除保守思想，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在竞赛中取得优异的成绩。经过这次全运会，谁也不敢自封先进，认为今后无需努力别人也赶不上。同时也没有人会再以“地区落后”等理由来作为衡量运动水平不高的主要因素。这是这次全运会中最有深远影响的收获。
    这次全运会的经验还证明，人们要想在竞赛中获得胜利，取得名列前茅，还必须把冲天的革命干劲和科学分析精神结合起来。因为只有把两者结合起来，才能够使自己的主观认识最大限度地符合客观实际规律，才会得到预期的效果。在竞赛中，很多运动员和他们的领队和教练都表现了既有技术水平、又有政治头脑。他们把党和人民的需要摆在第一位，提出了创造好成绩给国庆献礼的政治口号，在比赛时具有让高山低头、河水让路的革命英雄主义气概。他们勇敢顽强，克服困难，不屈不挠，充分发挥了技术特点，同时也对比赛情况作了冷静的科学分析，从而夺取了胜利。如球类预赛中四川男子篮球队胜北京，江西女子排球队胜解放军队，广东足球队连胜辽宁、上海等队，都是干劲足，信心高，破除了对强队的迷信，科学地分析了敌我双方的力量对比，制定了适当的对策，因而取得了胜利的。如果他们在强队面前事先就气馁，软了半截，泄了勇气，缺乏干劲，那末，要想取得胜利是不可能的。同样，有些人胜了易骄，败了易馁，结果都不能创造出好成绩来。
    由此可见，全运会并不只是技术水平的比赛，而是政治思想水平和技术水平的全面综合比赛，胜利的决定因素并不是一个，而是以政治思想为统帅的各个因素的总和。今后我们还要经常举行各种比赛，这些经验都是有益的。
    这次全国运动会的举行，目的是检阅我国体育运动十年发展的成就。结果证明，我们得到的是我国体育运动的政治思想水平和技术水平大大提高，整个体育战线获得了大面积丰收。当然，运动竞赛总是要排列先后的，但无论在前的，以至最末的个人和单位，都比过去提高。尤其可贵的是所有的选手和单位，都取得了丰富的经验。同时，在这次会上，大家都分秒必争、寸功不让地力争优胜和好名次，这也是正确的。不如此就不能充分展示我国体育运动已经达到的高度水平，不能在更高的水平上衡量先进和一般。但是，我们的竞赛，和资本主义国家把争锦标作为运动会的唯一目的根本不同。我们是要通过竞赛求出冠军、亚军、第三、第四等名次，树立先进，以便带动和鼓舞一般追上先进，并使先进的更加先进。同时，我们争锦标，立先进的目的是共同提高、相互学习，以便进一步发展群众性体育运动，增强人民体质，为生产和国防建设服务，为社会主义建设服务。因此，所有的体育骨干力量都应该在全运会的胜利基础上，继续努力锻炼，更快地提高自己，以便能更好地带动和鼓舞群众性体育运动的开展。这也就是体育工作在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。现在形势很好，全运会的事实使人们的思想得到进一步解放，并且又有了一支具有相当水平、并且毫不满足地要求上进的体育骨干，广大人民群众又十分爱好体育，这正是大力开展群众性体育的大好时机。因此，这次全运会的举行，应该看作是进一步发展群众性体育运动的新的起点。当然，在群众中进一步开展体育活动的时候，还要防止那种把体育看作是脱离国家政治和生产建设，看作是高于工农业生产的“体育至上主义”。这种思想是资产阶级观点在体育工作上的反映，是要不得的。但是，我们也不能赞成有些人把生产和体育对立起来，认为搞了生产就不能开展体育，否则就要耽误生产的保守看法。因为无数事实证明，无论在工厂，在公社，在机关，在学校，群众都有充分开展体育锻炼的热烈要求，也完全能够在不妨碍生产和工作的原则下充分开展这项活动，做好这项工作又大大有利于生产。我们希望在所有的地方都能把我国的这支体育骨干力量充分运用起来，一方面继续提高，同时能根据当地的具体情况，在为生产建设服务的原则下，组织群众进行适合于他们要求的多种多样的体育活动，使人人都能把身体锻炼得如钢似铁，精力旺盛，心情愉快，为社会主义事业贡献更大的力量。
