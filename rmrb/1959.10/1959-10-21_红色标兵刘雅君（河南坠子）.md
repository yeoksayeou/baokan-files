A new atmosphere with high tides of production, everyone is determined to be a pace-setter, ten thousand purples and thousands of reds cannot fully express it, singling out the youth Liu Yajun. This girl is petite and agile, a worker at the Changxindian Communications Factory, she looks very young with a face full of childishness, she's just turned eighteen this year in terms of age. Her family has a good class background, her father is an old worker of more than thirty years. He often talks about struggle stories, and the little girl is fascinated when she hears them. She studied in junior high school for two full years, secretly resolving to become a worker. She was really happy when she passed the apprenticeship exam, truly, where there's a will, there's a way. Entering the factory was another beautiful scene, everything looks new. The worker uncles are really energetic, lively and vigorous. There is an old worker who everyone respects, his name is Dai Fengchen. No defective products in ten years, never absent from work in seven years. Yajun secretly made up her mind to learn from Dai Fengchen. The morning whistle urges you to get up quickly, Yajun is already up to light the fire, all the tools are neatly arranged, the machine is wiped clean and shining, which is lovely. The masters are very happy to come to the workshop, happy that the preparatory work was completed early. The master has doubts in his mind: can this child persevere to the end? Liu Yajun uses practical actions to guarantee that she works very seriously every day. The master praised her without reservation, praising this capable assistant Liu Yajun. The little girl is small but has a drilling spirit, paying attention to the master's operation very carefully, she wants to go to the machine tool to operate for a while, fearing that the master will not approve. One day she mustered up the courage to ask: "Master, can I try it?" The master readily agreed, guiding the operation very enthusiastically. The little girl is both afraid and excited, operating carefully with her brain. She is worried that she will produce defective products, she only feels relieved after the inspection is qualified. The master said: "Yajun, very good, you learn very quickly, you are very smart!" From then on, Liu Yajun became more confident, and worked more seriously than before. After work, she does not rest or fool around, helping the shift master to do things. Take the opportunity to learn skills from the master, and ask clearly if there are any difficulties. The little girl has made progress with hard work, and quickly improved her technical level. She can be competent in separate operations, at this time she has only been in the factory for three months. Once, the foreman was worried: he had received a task that was very difficult, technically complex and with a tight deadline, who should this job be assigned to? After thinking about it, he couldn't make up his mind, and just happened to meet Liu Yajun: "Foreman, what should I do tomorrow? Can you assign it earlier?" The foreman said: "There are many jobs, but I'm afraid you won't be able to complete it. This job has a high quota and a tight deadline, I'm afraid you won't be able to do it." The little girl bravely guaranteed, calling out foreman, don't worry, although the task is heavy, I will work harder and I will definitely try to complete it. She did it without delay, truly skillful and clever. The more she did it, the more skilled she became, and the more energetic she became, completing the task beyond the quota. The quality is qualified and there are no defective products, the masters are all happy. This one praises her for her energy, and that one also praises her a few words. Yajun is very modest, she said, without the master's teaching, how could I do it? Speaking of last year's Great Leap Forward, the factory was in full swing with increased enthusiasm. Everyone liberated their minds and broke superstitions, everyone used their brains to find tricks. Liu Yajun bravely took the lead and showed her skills, concentrating on innovation. She improved her working methods diligently and made inventions one after another. The efficiency increased very quickly, the little girl is better than others! She has only been on the machine tool for sixteen months, and she has completed fifty-seven months of work! Entering the year 1963, it is really like riding a fast horse and galloping. The news spread and everyone was excited, and she was recognized as the number one red pace-setter. The employees are all discussing, making great ambitions to learn from Yajun to catch up with Yajun! Letters of determination are proposed one by one to guarantee that big-character posters are posted on the wall in colorful colors. We must learn her Liu Yajun's soaring energy, we must learn her cleverness and cleverness to engage in inventions, we must learn her high-yield, high-quality, no defective products, we must learn her whole-hearted production without absenteeism! This is exactly:
	The production upsurge is rolling,
	You chase me and run non-stop,
	Forward, forward, and forward again,
	Strive to be a pace-setter!
