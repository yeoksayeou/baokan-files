Xinhua News Agency, Vladivostok, October 7th: TASS reports that Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, delivered a speech at a mass rally in Vladivostok on the 6th.

In his speech, Khrushchev emphasized that the basic issue for the Soviet Union to patiently and firmly seek mutual understanding with the United States is the guarantee of lasting world peace. Khrushchev said that we cannot find a common language with American businessmen on the issue of social systems. We hold different positions on this issue. Let them live under the capitalist system, and we will live under the communist system, and see who does better.

But the struggle for peace is the main task today, and we must exert every effort to guarantee peace.

Recalling the threats of certain warmongering American generals, Khrushchev said that in this era when we have created extremely terrible tools of destruction, it is extremely dangerous to speak in such a way.

Khrushchev said that he had very frank talks with the US President on the issue of safeguarding peace. He said that he was pleased to talk with Eisenhower, a wise man who understands the seriousness of the international situation. Khrushchev specifically asked the President what he thought of a saying by a famous Western national leader that Khrushchev was afraid of war and therefore would not start a war. Eisenhower replied that he, as a soldier, frankly said that he was very afraid of war. Khrushchev said that in our time, only an irrational person would not be afraid of war.

Khrushchev pointed out that if someone imposes war on the people, that is another matter. In this case, one cannot be afraid of war, otherwise it would be equivalent to death. We must bravely defend the freedom and independence of our motherland. But it is unwise to be keen on war like a rooster likes to fight.

Khrushchev said that he had suggested to President Eisenhower—who also knows that war will bring terrible disasters to the people of all countries—to reach an agreement on joint actions to maintain peace. Khrushchev continued by saying that the President agreed to reach an agreement, but it seems that reaching an agreement is not so easy. Too much dirt has accumulated from the "Cold War". It takes time and patience from both sides to improve relations and ease tensions. Khrushchev said that we propose to reach an agreement on the basis of not threatening each other and not interfering in internal affairs. We adhere to our peaceful policy, and therefore put forward the proposal of complete and thorough disarmament to the United Nations.

Khrushchev emphasized that this proposal stipulates the establishment of extremely strict supervision. But we still need to do a lot of work in order to reach a good-faith mutual understanding with the United States and other leaders, so that we can better and more correctly understand each other.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has conducted and will continue to conduct unremitting struggles to eliminate the Cold War and ease international tensions. Khrushchev said that to those who vainly attempt to intimidate us with force, our answer is: If you try to impose the "Cold War" on us, then go ahead! We don't care. But in this case, we should strengthen our national defense and prepare rockets and other defensive weapons to repel the aggressors.

Khrushchev continued by saying that President Eisenhower invited me to visit their country, and he himself also expressed his willingness to visit the Soviet Union. He did this very wisely, which not only shows that he has foresight, but also shows that the American people are eager for peace.

Khrushchev said that a government summit seems likely to be held this autumn or winter. At this meeting, the exchange of opinions on issues of concern to the people of all countries will continue. Every effort must be made to guarantee lasting peace.

Khrushchev said that the powerful socialist camp is a strong bulwark of peace and security for the people of all countries. I came to Vladivostok after participating in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The scale of the festival celebration was grand. Under the leadership of their Communist Party, the Chinese people are victoriously developing the country's economy. Things are going well in People's China. During the days our party and government delegation stayed in Beijing, we had sincere and friendly meetings and talks with Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and other leaders. Our talks showed that we all stand on the same Marxist-Leninist position, and our two peoples are running together towards the same common goal—socialism and communism. The friendship between the great people of our two countries and the people of all socialist countries is constantly developing and strengthening. It is a guarantee for winning new victories in the struggle to build socialism and communism and to strive for world peace.

Khrushchev expressed his gratitude to the Soviet working people for their high evaluation of the results of his visit to the United States. He said that he always felt that the people wholeheartedly supported him and gave him great trust. Khrushchev said that it is a supreme honor to represent the great Soviet country and its great people.

Earlier in his speech, Khrushchev had said that during his visit to the United States, he became even more convinced of the correctness and great power of Marxist-Leninist theory.

Khrushchev said that some people in the United States now call capitalism "people's" and "humane" capitalism, which is unnatural. Capitalism survives by cruelly exploiting the labor of millions of people. The great Marx made a brilliant scientific analysis of the development of society, and life has fully confirmed his theory.

Khrushchev said that if it took the United States more than 150 years to reach its current level, then the Soviet Union has only taken 42 years to transform itself from a formerly backward country into a powerful socialist country with a highly developed economy, science, and culture.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union has been able to achieve all its achievements because of the socialist system. This system creates conditions for the people to fully exert their creativity and proves how great the ability of free people who are not subjected to exploitation and oppression and who are the true masters of their country is.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy is being successfully implemented. In his speech, Khrushchev also talked about some issues of economic development in the Primorsky Krai, centered on Vladivostok.

Xinhua News Agency, October 8th: TASS reports that Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, arrived in Krasnoyarsk today.

Prior to this, Khrushchev left Vladivostok on the 7th and arrived in Irkutsk. He visited the Irkutsk Hydropower Station built on the Angara River in Siberia. Subsequently, he also visited the progress of the Bratsk Hydropower Station project.

    赫鲁晓夫在海参崴群众大会上讲话
    必须尽一切努力保障持久和平
    政府首脑会议可能在今年秋天或冬天举行
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社海参崴7日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫6日在海参崴举行的群众大会上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中着重指出，苏联应该耐心地和坚定地寻求同美国相互谅解的基本问题，是保证世界持久和平的问题。赫鲁晓夫说，在社会制度问题上，我们同美国商人找不到共同的语言。在这个问题上我们持有不同的立场。就让他们在资本主义制度下生活吧，我们将在共产主义制度中生活，看看究竟谁搞得更好。
    但是，为和平而斗争，这是今天的主要任务，我们必须竭尽全力来保障和平。
    赫鲁晓夫在追述某些美国好战将军的威胁时说，在我们这个制造了极可怕的毁灭性工具的时代里，讲这样的话是极端危险的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他和美国总统就保障和平问题进行了十分坦率的会谈，他说，同艾森豪威尔、同一个了解国际局势严重性的明智的人会谈使他感到高兴。赫鲁晓夫特别询问了总统：一个西方有名的国家领导人说，赫鲁晓夫害怕战争，因此不会发动战争，总统对这句话的看法如何。艾森豪威尔回答说，他，作为一个军人坦率地说，是非常害怕战争的。赫鲁晓夫说，在我们这个时代里，只有不理智的人才会不害怕战争。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，如果有人把战争强加于人民，那是另外一回事，在这种情况下就不能怕战争，否则就等于死亡。必须勇敢地保卫自己祖国的自由和独立。但是，像公鸡喜欢打架一样地热中于战争，这是不明智的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他曾建议艾森豪威尔总统——总统也晓得战争会给各国人民带来可怕的灾难——就维护和平的共同行动达成协议。赫鲁晓夫接着说，总统同意达成协议，但是，看来达成协议并不是那么容易的事。“冷战”产生的积垢太多了。需要时间，需要双方对改善关系、对缓和紧张局势有耐性。赫鲁晓夫说，我们建议在这样一个基础上达成协议，这就是：不彼此威胁，不干涉内政。我们坚持我们的和平政策，因而向联合国提出了全面和彻底裁军的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，这个建议规定了建立极严格的监督。但是我们还需要作许多工作，以便同美国和其他领导人取得善意的相互谅解，以便我们更好地、更正确地彼此了解。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府过去进行过、将来仍然进行不懈的斗争，争取消除冷战，争取缓和国际紧张局势。赫鲁晓夫说，对于那些妄想以武力来吓唬我们的人，我们的回答是：如果你们企图把“冷战”强加给我们，那就请吧！我们是不在乎的。但是在这种情况下，我们应当加强我们的国防，准备好火箭和其他保卫武器，以便击退侵略者。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，艾森豪威尔总统邀请我到他们国家访问，并且他本人也表示愿意到苏联来访问，这一点他作得很明智，这不仅说明他有远见，而且也说明，美国人民渴望和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，政府首脑会议看样子可能在今年秋天或者冬天举行。在这个会议上将继续就各国人民所关心的问题交换意见。必须尽一切努力保障持久和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，强大的社会主义阵营是各国人民的和平和安全的坚强堡垒。我是参加了中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝典礼后到海参崴来的。节日庆典的规模宏大。中国人民在自己的共产党的领导下胜利地发展着国家的经济。在人民中国，事情进行得很好。在我们的党政代表团逗留北京的几天中，我们同毛泽东、刘少奇、朱德、周恩来同志以及其他领导人进行了诚挚友好的会见和会谈。我们的会谈表明，我们都站在同一个马克思列宁主义的立场上，我们两国人民一同奔向一致的共同的目标——社会主义、共产主义。我们两国伟大的人民、所有社会主义国家的人民的友谊在不断发展和加强，它是在争取建设社会主义和共产主义，争取全世界和平的斗争中获得新胜利的保证。
    赫鲁晓夫对苏联劳动人民对他的访美结果的崇高评价表示感谢。他说，他始终感到人民在一心一意地支持他，给了他很大的信任。赫鲁晓夫说，代表伟大的苏维埃国家和它的伟大的人民是无上光荣的。
    以前，赫鲁晓夫在他的讲话中曾经说过，他在美国访问时更加确信了马克思列宁主义理论的正确和伟大力量。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国现在有些人把资本主义叫做“人民的”“人道的”资本主义，这种说法是反自然的。资本主义是依靠残酷剥削千百万人的劳动而生存的。伟大的马克思对社会的发展作了精辟的科学分析，而生活则完全证实了他的理论。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果说，美国达到现在的水平用了一百五十多年，那么苏联只用了四十二年的时间就由一个从前落后的国家变成了一个拥有高度发达的经济、科学和文化的强大的社会主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联的一切成就之所以能够取得，是因为有社会主义制度。这个制度为人民创造条件，使他们能够充分发挥创造力，并证明不受剥削压迫的、作了自己国家真正主人的自由的人具有多么大的能力。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联发展国民经济的七年计划正在胜利地执行。赫鲁晓夫在讲话中也谈到了以海参崴为中心的滨海边疆区经济发展的某些问题。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，今天抵达克拉斯诺雅尔斯克。
    在这以前，赫鲁晓夫在7日离开海参崴到达伊尔库次克。他参观了建设在西伯利亚安加拉河上的伊尔库次克水电站。随后，他又参观了布拉次克水电站工程的进展情况。
