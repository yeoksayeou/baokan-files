Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, New York Dispatch: The full text of the Irish-Malayan proposal, which was illegally passed by the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st and slanders China, is as follows:

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling the principles concerning basic human rights and freedoms set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948,

    Considering that the people of Tibet, like all other peoples, are entitled to these basic human rights and freedoms, including the right of all persons, without distinction, to civil liberties and freedom of religious belief,

    Also noting the distinct cultural and religious traditions of the Tibetan people, as well as the autonomy they have traditionally enjoyed,

    Deeply disturbed by reports—including formal statements by His Holiness the Dalai Lama—that the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people have been forcibly denied,

    Regretting the effect that these events have on intensifying international tensions and worsening relations between peoples at a time when responsible leaders are making serious and positive efforts to ease tensions and improve international relations,

    1. Declares its conviction that respect for the principles of the Charter and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is essential for the evolution of a peaceful world order based on the rule of law.

    2. Calls for respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life.

    美国的货色　爱尔兰和马来亚的商标
    联大通过的诽谤中国的决议
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议21日非法通过的诽谤中国的爱尔兰—马来亚提案全文如下：
    大会，
    忆及联合国宪章中以及1948年12月10日大会通过的世界人权宣言中陈述的关于基本人权和自由的原则，
    考虑到西藏人民，像所有其他人民一样，有权享受的这些基本人权和自由包括一切人无区别地享有公民自由和宗教信仰自由的权利，
    还注意到西藏人民的独特的文化和宗教传统，以及他们一向享有的自治，
    对于说西藏人民的基本人权和自由已被强行剥夺的消息——包括达赖喇嘛大师的正式声明——深感不安，
    对于正当负责的领导人在进行认真积极的努力来和缓紧张局势和改善国际关系的时候这些事件对加剧国际紧张局势和恶化各国人民间的关系的影响感到遗憾，兹
    一、宣布相信尊重宪章原则和世界人权宣言原则对于以法治为基础的和平的世界秩序的演化是必不可少的。
    二、要求尊重西藏人民的基本人权和他们的独特的文化和宗教生活。
