    High-Yield Fields Shine Brightly

    The fact that more than ten million mu of high-yield fields in Sichuan Province are shining brightly is truly inspiring. This brilliance also clearly illuminates the ugly faces of some right-leaning opportunists and the errors of those with right-leaning conservative thoughts.

    In some rural areas, a fallacy emerged, claiming that "experimental fields have been messed up" and that "cultivating high-yield fields requires too much labor and investment, resulting in low income and being not worth the effort." What is the truth? Please see the following materials: the more than 600,000 mu of high-yield small spring crops in the Nanchong Special District of Sichuan Province have an average yield per mu that is about double that of ordinary fields; the more than 1,000 mu of high-yield wheat demonstration fields have a yield per mu exceeding 1,000 jin, which is more than double the average yield of ordinary fields; the corn yields per mu in the high-yield fields of counties such as Dianjiang, Guang'an, Wusheng, and Fengdu generally reach 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin, which is about double the average yield of ordinary fields; in Xichong County, the area of high-yield wheat fields accounts for 38% of the total wheat area, but the yield accounts for 63% of the total output, making high-yield fields the main force in completing agricultural production plans. Is this what is meant by "messed up" or "failed"?

    Generally speaking, cultivating experimental fields and high-yield fields requires more labor and investment than cultivating ordinary fields, but the returns are also greater. Under the conditions of greatly improved cultivation techniques, adding one unit of labor and capital results in not just one unit of return, but several units, or even multiples. First, let's look at the result of "more investment": the 229 mu of high-yield rapeseed demonstration fields managed by the Xindu County Party Committee cost an average of 44.49 yuan per mu in production expenses, while ordinary fields cost 13.85 yuan. Although the investment in high-yield fields was 30.64 yuan more than in ordinary fields, the total output value per mu of high-yield fields reached 87.65 yuan, while ordinary fields only reached 30.71 yuan. After deducting expenses, the net income per mu of high-yield fields was more than one and a half times that of ordinary fields. Next, let's look at the result of "more labor": the high-yield rice fields in the Sihe Management District of the Shunjiang Commune in Neijiang County used an average of 24 working days per mu. After deducting the investment of 11.5 yuan from the total output value, the value created per working day averaged 2.36 yuan. In the local ordinary fields, an average of 19 working days were used per mu, and after deducting the investment of 9.56 yuan from the total output value, the value created per working day averaged only 1.92 yuan. In other words, although high-yield fields used five more working days per mu than ordinary fields, the value created per working day was still much higher. The above are only the economic gains of the high-yield fields themselves. If we add the political and ideological gains, and the gains from the overall increase in production of ordinary fields driven by the high-yield fields, then the gains are even more immeasurable. It greatly helps to break superstitions and liberate thinking; it creates high-yield experience, sets an example for ordinary fields, and promotes the overall increase in production of ordinary fields; it enables leading cadres to learn production knowledge, be able to go deep into production and lead production, strengthen the Party's leadership over production, and strengthen the Party's connection with the masses. From whatever aspect, cultivating experimental fields and high-yield fields yields great gains. How can it be said to be "not worth the effort"?

    Why do right-leaning opportunists so vigorously attack experimental fields and high-yield fields? The fundamental reason is that they fear and oppose all new things, and fear and oppose the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the face of new things, old things will pale in comparison; as the new develops vigorously, the old will gradually die; as socialism rises, capitalism will decline. In the struggle between the two roads, right-leaning opportunism always represents the old, declining, and dying things, always lags behind the times, and attempts to hold back the wheel of history from moving forward. However, no matter how they struggle, the things they try to preserve will always decline and die, and the things they oppose will always develop and prosper. The wheel of history will always move forward.

### 丰产田大放光芒

    丰产田大放光芒
    四川省一千多万亩高额丰产田大放光芒，实在令人精神焕发。这光芒，同时也清楚地照出了一些右倾机会主义分子的丑面目和有右倾保守思想的人们的错误。
    在一部分农村中，曾经出现这么一种谬论，说什么“试验田，搞糟了”，“搞高额丰产田费工多，投资多，收入少，得不偿失”。事实究竟怎样呢？请看下面的材料：四川南充专区的六十多万亩小春作物高额丰产田，平均亩产比一般田高一倍左右；一千多亩小麦高产指挥田，亩产超过一千斤，比一般田平均亩产量高两倍多；垫江、广安、武胜、丰都等县的玉米高额丰产田的亩产量大都达到一千五百斤至两千斤，比一般田的平均产量高一倍左右；西充县小麦高额丰产田的面积占小麦总面积的38％，产量却占总产量的63％，高额丰产田已成为完成农业生产计划的主力。难道这是“搞糟了”“失败了”吗？
    种试验田和高额丰产田，一般地说是要比种一般田费工多一些，投资也多一些，可是，所得的也多。在大大改进耕作技术的条件下，多添一分工本，所得的就不只是一分，而是几分，甚至成倍。先看看“投资多”的结果如何吧：新都县委的二百二十九亩油菜高产指挥田，平均每亩的生产费用为四十四点四九元，一般田为十三点八五元，虽然高产田投资比一般田多三十点六四元，但高产田每亩总产值达八十七点六五元，一般田只有三十点七一元，除去开支，高产田每亩的纯收入比一般田多一倍半以上。再看看“费工多”的结果吧：内江县顺江公社四合管理区的水稻高额丰产田，平均每亩实用劳动日二十四个，从总产值中扣除投资十一点五元以后，平均每个劳动日创造的价值达二点三六元；当地的一般田，平均每亩用劳动日十九个，从总产值中扣除投资九点五六元以后，平均每个劳动日创造的价值只有一点九二元；也就是说，高额丰产田比一般田虽然每亩多用五个劳动日，每个劳动日创造的价值仍然多得很多。以上这些，还仅仅是高额丰产田本身经济上的所得，如果加上在政治上思想上的所得，和由于高额丰产田带动了一般田全面增产的所得，那就更多得无法计算了。它大大有助于破除迷信，解放思想；它创造了高产经验，为一般田树立榜样，推动一般田全面增产；它使领导干部学会生产知识，能够深入生产、领导生产，加强了党对生产的领导，加强了党与群众的联系。无论从哪方面来看，种试验田和高额丰产田都是所得甚多，怎能说是“得不偿失”呢？
    右倾机会主义分子为什么要这样大肆攻击试验田、高额丰产田呢？根本的原因是他们害怕和反对一切新鲜事物，害怕和反对鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在新事物面前，旧东西就会黯然失色；新的蓬勃发展，旧的就逐步死亡；社会主义兴起，资本主义就没落。在两条道路的斗争中，右倾机会主义总是代表着旧的、没落的、行将死亡的东西，总是落后于时代，而且企图拖住历史车轮不让前进。可是，无论他们怎样挣扎，他们企图保住的东西总是要没落、死亡，他们所反对的东西总是要发展、兴盛。历史的车轮总是要不断前进的。
