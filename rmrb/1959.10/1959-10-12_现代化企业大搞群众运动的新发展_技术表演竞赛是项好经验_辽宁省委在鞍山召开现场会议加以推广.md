Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th - The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting in Anshan to conscientiously promote the technical performance competition experience created by the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steel Plant. The meeting called on all enterprises in the province's industrial, transportation, and capital construction sectors to immediately launch a vigorous technical performance competition upsurge to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of this year's national plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule, and strive to overfulfill the production increase and frugality plan.

The meeting introduced in detail the technical performance competition experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steel Plant. The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steel Plant Party Committee, together with the workers, after repeated discussions in May of this year, created the technical performance competition. The main purpose was to improve the technical level through the workers' own production operation practice. Because the No. 3 Steel Plant widely carried out this competition, it further promoted workers to compete with each other in drive, wisdom, and collaboration, forming a mass movement to comprehensively improve thinking, improve technology, and improve production throughout the plant. The forms of this performance competition include individual performance competitions, cross-performance competitions, collective performance competitions, and joint collaborative performance competitions. Participants include not only advanced producers and veteran workers, but also new workers and workers with poor operating skills. When new workers perform, veteran workers teach them; when veteran workers perform, new workers learn from them. After the performance, evaluations and appraisals are organized. Whoever has advantages, after summarizing and improving them, are promoted throughout the plant; whoever has shortcomings, everyone helps him improve. It truly achieves that everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student, learning from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, and improving together. The experience of the No. 3 Steel Plant was soon promoted in various factories and mines in Anshan. According to statistics from 44 factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel from late August to early September, more than 59,000 large-scale performances had been carried out, with more than 250,000 participants; many industrial enterprises, commerce, and agriculture in Anshan City also learned from this experience in light of their own specific circumstances.

Practice over this period has proven that technical performance competitions have five major benefits. First, it rapidly improved the technical level of the vast number of workers, and promoted the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements. According to incomplete statistics from more than 40 units of Anshan Iron and Steel, since the launch of the technical performance competition, more than 4,100 technical innovations have emerged, and more than 1,100 advanced experiences have been summarized and promoted. Because the technical level of the workers has rapidly improved, many technical key points have been quickly resolved. Second, it improved the work style, strengthened enterprise management, established and improved many rules and regulations, and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, thus adapting to the needs of the production leap forward. Third, it strengthened communist collaboration. Through performance competitions, everyone actively contacted each other, actively helped each other, and created conditions for each other, so that many difficulties were overcome in a timely manner. A new atmosphere of unity and cooperation emerged between work sections, furnaces, and individuals. Fourth, it increased production. Since the launch of the technical performance competition in the No. 3 Steel Plant, the output has increased month by month. Compared with April, the average daily output of steel in August increased by 50%, and the average utilization coefficient increased by 3.05. After the launch of the technical performance competition in the No. 1 Steel Plant, the passive situation in production was reversed, and the output also increased by more than 10%. Fifth, it improved the ideological awareness of the masses, and greatly promoted the communist spirit. After the technical performance competition was launched, everyone was encouraged, and everyone strived to move forward. The technical level of people who were originally technically backward improved rapidly.

Based on the above situation, the meeting believes that the technical performance competition is a new development in mass movements in modern enterprises and is the basic form of all labor competitions at present. This competition closely combines political work and economic work, combines hard work and practical work with skillful work, and is a successful experience with great significance generated in the Great Leap Forward. This experience is applicable to all industrial enterprises.

The meeting pointed out that the current situation on the industrial front in Liaoning Province is very good, and a new production upsurge has emerged. The total industrial output value of the province increased by 12% in August compared with July, and increased by 15.7% in September compared with August. However, the tasks on the industrial front in the province in the fourth quarter are still very heavy. Therefore, the meeting called on all workers in the province to conscientiously promote the advanced experience of the No. 3 Steel Plant, immediately launch an upsurge of technical performance competitions, ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of this year's national leap forward plan ahead of schedule, and prepare for production in the first quarter of next year to ensure continued Great Leap Forward next year.

　　现代化企业大搞群众运动的新发展
    技术表演竞赛是项好经验
    辽宁省委在鞍山召开现场会议加以推广
    新华社鞍山11日电　中共辽宁省委最近在鞍山召开现场会议，认真推广鞍钢第三炼钢厂创造的技术表演竞赛经验。会议号召全省工业、交通运输、基本建设部门所有企业职工，立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈的技术表演竞赛的热潮，保证提前十五天到二十天全面完成今年国家计划，力争超额完成增产节约计划。
    会议详细地介绍了鞍钢第三炼钢厂的技术表演竞赛经验。鞍钢第三炼钢厂党委在今年5月间，同职工们一起经过反复讨论，然后创造出来的技术表演竞赛，主要的目的是通过工人自己的生产操作实践来提高技术水平。第三炼钢厂由于广泛开展了这一竞赛，进一步促进了工人相互比干劲比智慧比协作，在全厂范围内形成了全面提高思想、提高技术、提高生产的群众运动。这种表演竞赛的形式，有个人表演竞赛、交叉表演竞赛、集体表演竞赛和联合协作表演竞赛等多种。参加表演的不仅有先进生产者和老工人，也有新工人和操作技术较差的工人。新工人表演，老工人在旁边教；老工人表演，新工人在旁边学。表演以后就组织评比和鉴定。谁有优点，归纳提高以后在全厂推广；谁有缺点，大家就帮助他改进。真正做到了人人是先生，人人是学生，取长补短，共同提高。第三炼钢厂的这一经验，不久就在鞍山市各厂矿作了推广。根据鞍钢四十四个厂矿8月下旬到9月初的统计，先后进行的较大规模的表演已有五万九千多次，参加的人数达二十五万多人次；鞍山市的许多工业企业和商业、农业也都结合本身的具体情况学习了这一经验。
    通过这段时间的实践证明，技术表演竞赛有五大好处。第一，迅速提高了广大职工技术水平，推动了技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。据鞍钢四十多个单位的不完全统计，从开展技术表演竞赛以来，涌现出的技术革新就有四千一百多件，总结和推广了一千一百多件先进经验。由于职工们的技术水平迅速提高，许多技术关键迅速获得了解决。第二，改进了工作作风，加强了企业管理，建立和健全了许多规章制度，密切了干部与群众的关系，因此适应了生产跃进的需要。第三，加强了共产主义大协作。通过表演竞赛，大家主动地联系、主动地帮助、互相创造条件，使许多困难及时得到克服。工段与工段、炉与炉、个人与个人之间，出现了团结协作的新风气。第四，提高了生产。第三炼钢厂开展技术表演竞赛以来，产量一月高过一月，8月份与4月份比较，钢的平均日产量提高了50％，平均利用系数提高三点零五。第一炼钢厂开展技术表演竞赛后，扭转了生产被动局面，产量也提高了10％以上。第五，提高了群众的思想觉悟，共产主义精神大大发扬。技术表演竞赛开展起来以后，人人鼓干劲，个个争上游，原来技术落后的人技术水平迅速提高。
    根据上述情况，会议认为技术表演竞赛是现代化企业中大搞群众运动的新发展，是当前一切劳动竞赛的基本形式。这一竞赛把政治工作和经济工作密切结合起来，把苦干实干和巧干结合起来，是大跃进中产生的一项具有重大意义的成功经验。这一经验适用于一切工业企业。
    会议指出，目前辽宁省工业战线的形势很好，出现了新的生产高潮。全省工业总产值8月份比7月份增长了12％，9月份又比8月份增长了15.7％。但是第四季度全省工业战线上的任务仍然非常繁重。因此，会议号召全省职工认真推广第三炼钢厂的先进经验，立即掀起技术表演竞赛的热潮，保证提前全面完成今年国家跃进计划，并且为明年第一季度作好生产准备工作，保证明年继续大跃进。
