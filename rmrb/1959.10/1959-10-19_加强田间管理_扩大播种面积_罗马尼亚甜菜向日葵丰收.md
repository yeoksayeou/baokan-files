Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Electric: This year, Romania has achieved a bumper harvest of sugar beets and sunflowers.

Many collective farms achieved yields of 30,000 to 35,000 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare and 1,400 to 2,000 kilograms of sunflower seeds per hectare. Last year, the national average yield was only over 12,000 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare and only 770 kilograms of sunflower seeds per hectare.

This year, the good harvest of these two economic crops in Romania is due to the strengthening of field management and the expansion of the planting area of sugar beets and sunflowers. This year, the planting area of ​​these two crops has increased by more than 40% compared with last year. At the same time, the irrigated area of ​​sugar beet fields has also been expanded.

In the past year or two, Romania's sugar and edible oil production has more than doubled compared to 1938, but it still cannot meet the growing consumption needs. Last year, the Romanian Workers' Party's November Central Plenary Session made a decision to expand the planting area of sugar beets and sunflowers and to terminate the import of sugar and edible oil from 1960. Farmers in various places enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and achieved great success in this year's harvest season.

The bumper harvest of sugar beets and sunflowers will play an important role in stopping the import of sugar and edible oil from next year.

### 加强田间管理  扩大播种面积  罗马尼亚甜菜向日葵丰收

　　加强田间管理  扩大播种面积
    罗马尼亚甜菜向日葵丰收
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　今年，罗马尼亚的甜菜和向日葵获得了丰收。
    许多集体农庄每公顷甜菜的收获量达三万到三万五千公斤，每公顷向日葵子的收获量达一千四百到二千公斤。而去年全国平均每公顷甜菜的收获量只有一万二千多公斤，每公顷向日葵子的收获量只有七百七十公斤。
    今年，罗马尼亚这两种经济作物之所以获得这样好的收成，是因为加强了田间管理，扩大了甜菜和向日葵的种植面积。今年这两种作物的种植面积都比去年扩大了40％以上。同时，甜菜田地的灌溉面积也扩大了。
    最近一两年来，罗马尼亚食糖和食油的产量都比1938年增加了一倍多，但仍然不能满足日益增长的消费需要。去年，罗马尼亚工人党十一月中央全会作出了扩大甜菜和向日葵种植面积和从1960年终止食糖和食油进口的决定。各地农民热烈响应了党的号召，并且在今年的收获季节中获得了巨大的成就。
    甜菜和向日葵的丰收，对于从明年起停止食糖和食油的进口将起重要的作用。
