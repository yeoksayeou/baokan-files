West Germany's Economic Expansion and Internal Contradictions of Imperialism
Jin Ma

　　The uneven development of capitalism after the war is particularly evident in the rapid growth of West Germany's economic strength. This situation is changing the balance of power between countries in the capitalist world, intensifying their contradictions.

　　Thanks to U.S. support, West Germany's highly concentrated industry, the strong foundation of its monopoly capital, and relatively cheaper labor compared to most Western European countries, it has regained its pre-war status as an imperialist power in just over a decade. In 1948, West Germany's industrial production was only one-third of its pre-war level, but by 1950 it had recovered to near pre-war levels. From 1950 to 1957, West Germany's industrial production more than doubled; during the same period, Britain only grew by 21% and the United States by 27%. This situation increased West Germany's share of industrial production in the capitalist world from 4.6% in 1948 to 10.5% in 1958, surpassing Britain and France, second only to the United States and becoming the second largest industrial country in the West. In terms of foreign trade, West Germany's total exports in 1947 were only one-tenth of Britain's, but by 1958 they were close to equal, while exports of manufactured goods had already exceeded Britain. Its gold and foreign exchange reserves far exceeded those of Britain and France. Private long-term capital exports in the first half of 1959 were close to those of Britain, meaning it had become a major capital-exporting country in the capitalist world.

　　West Germany's rise has shaken its Western partners. But this is precisely the result of their own, primarily U.S., efforts to support West Germany after the war. In order to restore the strength of West German monopoly capital and make it a major pillar of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States, Britain, and France, from 1950 onwards, successively released forty-two monopoly giants and war criminals such as Krupp, Thyssen, and Flick, and returned their property. The provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding restrictions on West Germany's steel, chemical, aluminum, and other military-related production sectors were all revoked. The United States, eager to develop West Germany's military industrial potential, also promoted the development of West German industry through the "Marshall Plan," government loans, and private capital cooperation.

　　Under such meticulous care, the West German military monopoly capital groups, the same industrial giants who invited Hitler to power, such as Krupp, Thyssen, Farben, and Siemens, quickly regained control of the country's economic lifeline: Krupp controlled 16% of West Germany's steel production capacity; Thyssen controlled a quarter of West Germany's total crude steel, pig iron, and steel production; the Farben Trust (which produced 84% of Hitler's explosives) controlled 70% of West Germany's chemical industry; and the Siemens Konzern and General Electric controlled 85% of the total capital stock of West Germany's electrical enterprises... As a result, the concentration of West German monopoly capital in 1954 exceeded the level of fascist Germany's expansion in 1938 before the war.

　　Under the high concentration of industrial production, West German monopoly capital has the power to make large-scale fixed capital investments and equipment upgrades. West Germany's annual capital investment generally exceeds 20% of its gross national product, higher than major capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, which has created the basis for its rapid increase in industrial production. This, coupled with low real wages for West German workers, allows West German monopoly capital's cheap goods to crowd out Britain, France, and even the United States in foreign markets, displaying an aggressive posture.

　　West Germany's outward economic expansion is characterized by its swiftness and ambition. Lacking its own colonies, it first directs its attention to Western Europe, with over 60% of its total exports going to this important trading area that accounts for 45.2% of the capitalist world's imports, posing a serious threat to the export trade of the United States, Britain, and France. The intensity of the competition can be seen from the following figures: in 1948, West Germany's total exports to Western European countries were only two-fifths of France's and one-quarter of Britain's, but in 1950 and 1951, they caught up with France and Britain respectively, and in 1953 they caught up with the United States. From 1953 to 1957, the absolute amount of West Germany's exports to Western Europe increased even more dramatically, five times the increase in Britain's exports to the region during the same period, creating a sharp contradiction between West Germany and Britain. While Britain is worried about losing this important market second only to the Sterling Area and the Dollar Area, West Germany, backed by its economic strength, is economically wooing France, Italy, and the Benelux countries to form a "Common Market" to counter Britain's "Free Trade Area" proposal, attempting to exclude Britain not only economically but also politically from the European continent, in order to ultimately achieve hegemony in Western Europe. In attacking Britain, its main rival, West Germany has fully exploited the contradictions between France and Britain in the struggle for leadership and economic interests in Western Europe. France needs financial assistance from the United States or West Germany in issues such as the Algerian War, building atomic bombs, and developing North Africa, but the United States does not want to support France and even wants to covet its North African interests, while West Germany hopes to win over France to resist Britain. De Gaulle then seized the opportunity to turn to Adenauer. Thus, there appeared a "honeymoon" between these two historical enemies. However, because West Germany's economic strength is twice that of France, this "cooperation" with such a disparity in power is bound to be overwhelming for France. Recently, the contradictions that have emerged between the French Sahara oil consortium and the West German Ruhr coal industry in the competition for the fuel market have sharply strained the relationship between France and West Germany within the Coal and Steel Community. France has unilaterally proposed to reorganize the group. In addition, Britain's plan to unite Sweden, Norway, Austria, and other countries to form an "Outer Seven Free Trade Area" to dismantle the "Common Market" has also caused rifts between West Germany and France. The original purpose of Britain's plan was to threaten West Germany by isolating West Germany's exports to the seven countries (about 27% of West Germany's exports), forcing it to agree to open up the "Common Market" or reopen "Free Trade Area" negotiations. When West Germany was worried about suffering huge losses and prepared to bargain with Britain on this matter, France was afraid that the negotiation results would lead to it being attacked from both sides by Britain and West Germany within the "Common Market" and expressed firm opposition. The reason why the current disagreements between West Germany and France have not erupted into an open split is only because the far-sighted Adenauer government, after weighing the pros and cons, still decided to focus on attacking its British rival first, and would rather make some small concessions to France temporarily to ease the contradictions. However, this attitude of "excessive compromise" towards France has aroused strong dissatisfaction within West Germany.

　　While West Germany is ambitiously arranging its economic and political control over Western Europe in order to seize hegemony, it has not relaxed its efforts to expand its influence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is plotting to undermine the United States, Britain, and France.

　　In the Middle East, where British and French influence is increasingly weakening, West Germany's activities are exceptionally active. As early as 1952, its exports in this region surpassed France. From 1952 to 1955, West Germany's share in the foreign trade of ten countries in the Near and Middle East rose from 6% to 18.2%, while Britain's share fell from 31% to 26.7% during the same period. Currently, West Germany's exports to the United Arab Republic and Iran have surpassed the United States and Britain and rank first. In Turkey's import trade, West Germany's share has exceeded that of the United States. In the spring of 1958, when the international monopoly capital organization, the International Trust "Middle East Economic Development Company," was preparing to step up its expansion into the Middle East, as many as forty large West German monopoly enterprises, including General Electric, Krupp, and Thyssen, sent representatives to participate in this international monopoly organization.

　　In Latin America, the penetration of West German goods is equally astonishing. From 1948 to 1957, West Germany's total exports to Latin America jumped from six million U.S. dollars to seven hundred million U.S. dollars, and it defeated Britain in Britain's traditional markets: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and other countries, seizing the second place in exports to these countries, second only to the United States. Not only that, but it also uses local anti-American sentiment to woo these countries with small favors to seize the U.S. market. For example, in 1958, U.S. exports to Latin America fell by 11%, but at the same time, West Germany's exports increased by 10%. Recently, West Germany's control of the agricultural machinery market in Brazil and Argentina has caused great dissatisfaction among U.S. agricultural machinery exporters.

　　As for the Southeast Asian market, due to the fierce competition from the United States, Britain, and Japan, West Germany's exports to this region are currently not large, accounting for only 5% of its total exports. However, in terms of development speed, it is very impressive. For example, from 1950 to 1957, West Germany's exports to Southeast Asia increased seven and a half times. In terms of exports to India, a traditional British market, they increased fourteen times. West German Economics Minister Erhard's tour of eight Asian countries in 1958 and Krupp's visit to Japan in the first half of this year were all aimed at finding outlets for West German goods and capital in Southeast Asia.

　　West Germany has not even relaxed its attention to Africa. From 1951 to 1956, its exports to Africa increased by one and a half times. Here, its main targets of expansion are the Union of South Africa, which is within the British sphere of influence, as well as French Black Africa and the Belgian Congo. In 1955, its exports to the Congo increased more than twenty-three times compared to before the war.

　　West Germany's expansion into economically underdeveloped regions is not limited to exporting goods. From 1955 onwards, due to the abundance of capital accumulation, West Germany also began to export capital in large quantities. In order to provide conditions for this export, as early as 1957, West Germany had signed "technical assistance agreements" with sixteen economically underdeveloped countries, stipulating that West Germany would be responsible for training technicians, providing consultants, and providing technical guidance for the other party. This year, West Germany's wave of foreign investment has become even more enthusiastic. The Aswan Dam project and oil exploration and pipeline laying project in the United Arab Republic, the chemical factory project in India's Five-Year Plan, Pakistan's "Agricultural Development Plan," Ethiopia's public works, Brazil's various steel and machinery manufacturing plants, Argentina's tractor factory... have all become the spoils of West German monopoly capital. No wonder the Parisian "Liberation" newspaper clamored that West Germany is promoting its own "Marshall Plan"; that is, it lends its large amounts of gold and foreign exchange to the countries concerned, and then sells German industrial products to them. Just like what (the United States) did in Europe not long ago, turning these countries into political and economic vassals of Germany.

　　West Germany's rapid rise is changing the balance of power within the imperialist camp, deepening and intensifying the struggle between them for markets. At present, Western Europe has finally split into two opposing economic blocs: the "Six-Nation Common Market" and the "Seven-Nation Free Trade Area." This fact fully demonstrates that the inherent contradictions of imperialism have reached an unprecedented level since the war.

　　The United States, Britain, and France have been supporting and using West Germany since the war as a tool to carry out the Cold War and hot wars against the Soviet Union and communism, but in implementing this policy, they are repeating the mistake of supporting Hitler's Germany after World War I, "lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet." Facts have proved that this policy of the United States, Britain, and France has led to the accelerated disintegration of the imperialist camp, and has not helped them at all in their wishful thinking of attacking the socialist camp.

　　西德的经济扩张和帝国主义内部矛盾
　　金马
    战后资本主义世界经济发展不平衡规律的作用特别表现在西德经济实力的迅速发展方面。这一情况改变着资本主义世界国家间的实力对比，使它们的矛盾更趋于白热化。
    由于美国的扶植，再加上西德工业的高度集中、它的垄断资本实力基础的雄厚、国内劳动力的较西欧多数国家便宜，使它在短短的十多年的时间内，便恢复了战前帝国主义强国的地位。1948年西德的工业生产只有战前三分之一，1950年就恢复到接近战前水平。从1950年到1957年，西德工业生产增加了一倍多；同时期英国只增长21％，美国增长27％。这一情况使西德在资本主义世界工业生产中占的比重从1948年的4.6％增加到1958年的10.5％，超过英、法，仅次于美国而成为西方第二大工业国。在对外贸易方面，1947年西德的总出口仅为英国的十分之一，1958年就已同英国接近相等，而工业制成品出口则已超过英国。它的黄金外汇储备更是大大超过英、法。私人长期资本输出数字在1959年上半年已与英国相接近，这就是说，它已成为资本主义世界一个主要资本输出国家。
    西德的崛起，使它的西方伙伴为之震动。但这正是它们自己，首先是美国，战后全力扶植西德的结果。为了恢复西德垄断资本的实力使它成为侵略性的北大西洋集团的主要支柱，美、英、法三国从1950年起不惜先后释放了西德的克虏伯、蒂森、弗立克等四十二名垄断巨头和战犯，并发还他们的财产；波茨坦协定有关限制西德钢铁、化学、制铝等与军事有关生产部门的规定都被一一撤销。亟于发展西德军事工业潜力的美国还通过“马歇尔计划”、政府贷款、私人资本合作来推动西德工业的发展。
    在这种无微不至的照顾下，西德军事垄断资本集团，也就是那些曾经请希特勒上台的工业巨头像克虏伯、蒂森、法本、西门子等，很快就又重新控制了这个国家的经济命脉：克虏伯控制了西德产钢能力的16％；蒂森控制了西德全部原钢、生铁和钢材生产的四分之一；法本托辣斯（它曾为希特勒制造84％的炸药）控制着70％的西德化学工业；西门子康采恩和通用电气公司则控制了西德电气企业全部股本的85％……于是西德垄断资本的集中程度在1954年便超过战前1938年法西斯德国扩张时期的水平。
    在工业生产高度集中下，西德垄断资本遂有力量来进行大规模固定资本投资和设备更新。西德每年资本投资额一般都超过国民总产值20％以上，高于美、英、法等主要资本主义国家，由此造成了它工业生产迅速上升的基础。这种情况加上西德工人实际工资低，就使西德垄断资本的廉价商品能在国外市场上排挤英、法，甚至美国，显示了咄咄迫人之势。
    西德的向外经济扩张呈现了来势既猛而又雄心勃勃的特点。由于没有自己的殖民地，它首先把矛头指向西欧，占总额60％以上的出口都输往这个占资本主义世界进口45.2％的重要贸易区，形成了对美、英、法三国出口贸易的严重威胁。其竞争激烈的情况从下列数字就可看出：1948年西德对西欧国家的出口总额才只有法国的五分之二，英国的四分之一，但在1950年和1951年就分别赶上了法国和英国，1953年又追上了美国。从1953年到1957年西德对西欧出口增加的绝对数量更属惊人，五倍于同时期中英国对这个地区出口增加的数量，形成了西德和英国之间的尖锐矛盾。当英国正在忧心忡忡，怕失掉这个仅次于英镑区和美元区的重要市场的时候，西德却以它的经济实力为后盾，在经济上拉拢法国、意大利和荷、比、卢五国组织“共同市场”，来同英国的“自由贸易区”主张相对抗，力图把英国不仅在经济上而且也在政治上排挤出欧洲大陆，以便最后取得西欧霸权。在打击英国这个主要劲敌中，西德曾充分利用了法英之间在争夺西欧领导权和经济利益上的矛盾。法国因在进行阿尔及利亚战争、制造原子弹、开发北非等问题上需要美国或西德的财政援助，但美国却不想支持法国，甚至还想觊觎它的北非利益，而西德则正希望拉法以抗英，戴高乐遂乘机转而投靠阿登纳。于是就出现了这两个世仇间的“密月”。但是由于西德经济实力倍于法国，这种力量悬殊的“合作”，势必使法国吃不消。最近法国撒哈拉石油财团和西德鲁尔煤炭工业在争取燃料市场的竞争上出现的矛盾，已经使煤钢联营集团内部法国和西德的关系陡趋紧张。法国已单方面提出了要改组这个集团的建议。另外，英国联合瑞典、挪威、奥地利等国家，组成“外部七国自由贸易区”来拆散“共同市场”的计划也引起西德和法国之间的裂痕。英国这个计划原是要以隔绝西德对七国的出口（约占西德出口27％），来威胁西德迫使其同意开放“共同市场”或重开“自由贸易区”谈判。当西德担心损失巨大，准备就此同英国讨价还价时，法国却害怕谈判结果会形成在“共同市场”内受英国和西德的两面夹攻，而表示坚决反对。目前西德和法国的分歧之所以没有爆发为公开决裂，只是由于深谋远虑的阿登纳政府权衡轻重后，仍决定以先打击它的英国敌手为主，而宁愿对法国暂作一些小让步以缓和矛盾。但这一对法国“过事妥协”的态度已在西德内部引起强烈不满。
    当西德野心勃勃地在布置对西欧的经济和政治控制以便夺取霸权的时候，它也并没有放松在亚、非、拉丁美洲地区扩展势力，阴谋挖美、英、法墙角的努力。
    在英、法势力日益削弱的中东地区，西德的活动，异常积极。早在1952年它在这一地区的出口就赶过了法国。从1952年到1955年西德在中近东十个国家对外贸易中的比重由6％上升到18.2％，同时期英国的份额却从31％下跌到26.7％。目前西德在阿联和伊朗的出口已压倒美、英而占居首位。在土耳其的进口贸易中，西德所占的比重已超过美国。1958年春天，当国际垄断资本组织的国际托辣斯“中东经济开发公司”准备加紧向中东扩张时，西德竟有四十家大垄断企业，包括通用电气公司、克虏伯、蒂森等派代表参加了这个国际垄断组织。
    在拉丁美洲，西德商品的渗入也同样惊人。从1948年到1957年西德对拉丁美洲的出口总值从六百万美元跃升到七亿美元，并在英国的传统市场：巴西、阿根廷、委内瑞拉等国家击败了英国，夺取了对这些国家的出口仅次于美国的第二把交椅。不仅如此，它还利用当地反美情绪，以小恩小惠拉拢这些国家来夺取美国的市场。例如1958年，美国对拉丁美洲出口下降了11％，但同时西德的出口却增加了10％；最近西德控制巴西和阿根廷的农业机器市场已引起美国农业机器出口商的很大不满。
    就东南亚市场来说，由于美、英、日的剧烈竞争，西德对这里的出口量目前还不大，只占它总出口的5％。但是从发展速度看，却是十分可观。例如，从1950年到1957年西德对东南亚出口就增加了七倍半。以对英国的传统市场印度的出口来说，则增加了十四倍。1958年西德经济部长艾哈德的周游亚洲八国，今年上半年克虏伯的访问日本都是为了在东南亚给西德的商品和资本寻找出路。
    西德甚至对非洲也没有放松注意。从1951年到1956年，它对非洲出口增加了一倍半。这里它的主要扩张对象是属英国势力范围的南非联邦以及法属黑非洲和比属刚果。1955年它对刚果的出口就比战前增加了二十三倍多。
    西德对经济不发达地区的扩张并不以输出商品为限。从1955年起，由于资本积累的雄厚，西德也开始大量输出资本。为了给这种输出提供条件，早在1957年，西德已经同十六个经济不发达国家签订了“技术援助协定”，规定由西德负责替对方训练技术人员、提供顾问和技术指导等。今年以来，西德的这种向国外投资的浪潮更加热中。阿联的阿斯旺水坝工程和石油勘探和油管铺设工程、印度五年计划中的化工工厂工程、巴基斯坦的“农业发展计划”、埃塞俄比亚的公共工程、巴西的各种钢铁和机器制造工厂、阿根廷的拖拉机厂……都成了西德垄断资本的掳获物。难怪巴黎的“解放报”要叫嚷说，西德正在推行它自己的一种“马歇尔计划”；即把它的大量黄金和外汇借给有关国家，然后把德国的工业品卖给它们。就像不久前（美国）在欧洲的做法一样，使这些国家变成德国的政治和经济附庸。西德的迅速崛起正在改变着帝国主义阵营内部的力量对比，加深和加剧着它们之间争夺市场的斗争。目前西欧终于分裂为“六国共同市场”和“七国自由贸易区”两个对垒的经济集团。这一事实充分说明帝国主义内在矛盾已达到战后以来空前未有的程度。
    美英法三国，战后以来一直在扶持和利用西德作为反苏反共进行冷战和热战的工具，但是在执行这一政策中，它们却在重蹈第一次大战后扶植希特勒德国，“搬起石头砸自己的脚”的复辙。事实证明，美、英、法的这种政策已导致了帝国主义阵营加速走向四分五裂，而丝毫无助于它们打击社会主义阵营的如意算盘的。
