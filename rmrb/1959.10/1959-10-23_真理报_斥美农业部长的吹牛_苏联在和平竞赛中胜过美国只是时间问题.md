Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - The "People's Daily" published an article on the 18th, commenting on the speech made by the US Secretary of Agriculture, Benson, on the 16th at the National Grain Harvester Competition Assembly in the United States after his visit to the Soviet Union.

    The article said that the US Secretary of Agriculture was not truthfully telling the American people what he saw in the Soviet Union, but was immoderately praising the capitalist road of agricultural development.

    The commentary said that no one denies that the United States is temporarily ahead of Soviet agriculture in terms of agricultural mechanization and labor productivity. The commentary emphasized that this phenomenon is temporary. Even Benson himself had to admit that "the Soviet Union has made great achievements in agriculture."

    The article pointed out that the Soviet Union has already caught up with the United States in terms of total output of milk, especially animal fats, and is expected to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita output of these products in the next few years. And the Soviet Union produces more wheat, beets, and wool than the United States.

    The article said that the US Secretary of Agriculture is somewhat overconfident. The future will prove who will win in this peaceful competition. The article also called on the Soviet people to use their labor to accomplish the task of catching up with the United States in the shortest possible time.

    The "People's Daily" published Benson's speech on the 18th. In his speech, Benson boasted that "Soviet farmers will never be able to catch up with and surpass our agricultural production level."

    Benson said that after personally visiting various forms of agricultural management in the Soviet Union, he was even more convinced of the "superiority of the American agricultural system." He affirmed that the great strength of the American agricultural system lies in the private ownership of farms, the stimulus of the pursuit of profit, market competition, and the freedom of each farmer to plant and sell.

    Benson said that he found great achievements in Soviet agriculture, but also said that now "their productivity is still a long way from our productivity."

    “真理报”斥美农业部长的吹牛
    苏联在和平竞赛中胜过美国只是时间问题
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在18日发表一篇文章，评论美国农业部长本逊在访问苏联之后16日在美国全国谷物收割机比赛大会上的讲话。
    文章说，美国农业部长不是在向美国人真实地讲他在苏联所看到的东西，而是在没有分寸地颂扬资本主义农业发展道路。
    评论说，谁也不否认美国在农业机械化和劳动生产率方面暂时走在苏联农业的前面。评论强调指出，但是，这一现象是暂时的。就连本逊本人也不得不承认，“苏联在农业方面有很大的成就”。
    文章指出，苏联在牛奶尤其是动物油脂的总产量方面已经赶上了美国，并且在最近几年就可望在这些产品按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上并超过美国。而苏联的小麦、甜菜和羊毛的生产比美国要多。
    文章说，美国的农业部长未免有些过于自信了。未来将会证明，在这一和平竞赛中，胜利将属于谁。文章并号召苏联人民用自己的劳动来实现在最短时期内赶上美国的任务。
    “真理报”18日刊登了本逊的这篇讲话。本逊在讲话中吹牛说，“苏联的农民永远也不可能赶上并超过我国的农业生产水平”。
    本逊说，在他亲自参观了苏联各种管理形式的农业之后，他更加确信美国“农业制度的优越性”。他肯定说，美国农业制度的伟大力量在于农场的私有制、追求利润的刺激、市场竞争以及每个农民种植和出售的自由。
    本逊说，他发现苏联农业有很大的成就，但是又说，现在“他们的生产率同我们的生产率还有着很大的距离”。
