	A Triumphant Song of Peace and Friendship
	--Commemorating the Ninth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Entry into Korea and the First Anniversary of Their Return Home
	Yang Yong
	October 25th is recorded in history as a victorious festival for the struggle for peace.
	Nine years ago today, the flames of aggression ignited by U.S. imperialism in Korea were rapidly spreading towards our northeastern border. The U.S. war-mongering clique attempted to annex the entire Korean Peninsula and, following in the footsteps of Japanese militarism, attack China, seriously threatening world peace. To defend our homes and country and safeguard peace, the Chinese people resolutely formed the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, going abroad to fight. After two years and nine months of heroic fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, they finally defeated the U.S. aggressors, won the armistice, and victoriously defended peace in the Far East and the world. One year ago today, after victoriously completing the historical mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, voluntarily withdrew completely from Korea. From the CPV's dispatch to their withdrawal, the Chinese and Korean people, fighting together for justice, jointly sang a triumphant song of peace!
	However, the U.S. ruling clique, nourished by the huge profits of arms production and obsessed with maintaining its position of strength and world hegemony, continues to pursue a policy of cold war and escalating tensions. It has been a year since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, but the U.S. aggressor troops who are relying on South Korea not only did not withdraw, but are instead strengthening their activities to establish atomic war bases in South Korea, which is obvious evidence.
	October 25th is also an unforgettable day in the history of Sino-Korean friendship!
	From the CPV's entry into Korea to their return home, the two peoples and armies, under the leadership of the two Communist Parties (Workers' Party), engaged in a common struggle against U.S. aggression and to defend peace. This made the long-standing Sino-Korean friendship reach a height far exceeding anything in history, providing a brilliant example of a new type of relationship between socialist countries, demonstrating the invincible power of proletarian international solidarity. This friendship was intensely demonstrated last year when the CPV withdrew from Korea, deeply touching people around the world and becoming a celebrated story. But even more touching is that this friendship between the two peoples continues to grow day by day even after the CPV completely withdrew from Korea. In the short year since the CPV withdrew from Korea, the Korean Party and government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean military delegation led by Comrade Kim Kwang-hyop have visited China twice. The Korean people's enthusiastic concern and support for China's Great Leap Forward and People's Commune movement, the large-scale "Korean-Chinese Friendship Month" activities and the completion of the Friendship Tower commemorating the Chinese People's Volunteers during the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the first anniversary of the return of the CPV, as well as countless warm letters from Korean comrades-in-arms on the common festivals of the two peoples, all further enhance this friendship. Similarly, the returning CPV commanders and fighters brought back the infinite love of the Korean mothers and children, Korean comrades-in-arms for the new China and Chairman Mao, and along with the seeds of the endless rose sown in every corner of the motherland, sowed the friendship of the Korean people in the hearts of 650 million people. Today, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, from the Yalu River to the Pamir Plateau, care about, are familiar with, and cheer for the Korean Chollima Movement, just as they care about, are familiar with, and cheer for their own country's Great Leap Forward. The Chinese people share weal and woe with the Korean people in the war years, and today they share joy with the Korean people in the march towards building socialism. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is truly like that of brothers, as close as hands and feet, radiating magnificent brilliance in the history of the friendship of the people of the world.
	The formation and development of such a deep and solid friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is also due to the fact that both countries treat our common cause with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and handle our mutual relations with the spirit of complete equality, mutual assistance, and mutual cooperation. The Chinese people deeply know that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is precisely for defending our homes and country, and that in order to defend our homes and country, we must resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The Korean people also deeply know that adhering to the anti-U.S. struggle is to aid China and the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to fulfill the internationalist obligations of the Korean people. It is from this proletarian internationalist thought that the Korean Workers' Party, Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Republic's government, and the broad masses of the Korean people cherish and support the CPV like their own children and brothers, and do their best to provide support. They praise the CPV even more for doing a little bit of good for the Korean people. From the war period until after the armistice, countless internationalist heroes represented by An Ok-hee, Park Jae-geun, Fang Xingfu, the Fang Yuangen father and son, and Zheng Shanjie emerged among the Korean people, who were willing to sacrifice themselves to protect and help the CPV. From Flying Tiger Mountain and Shangganling to the Jincheng counterattack in the summer of 1953, the Korean people's upsurge in supporting the CPV was higher than ever. The vivid deeds of many "CPV mothers" and model supporters of the army in cherishing the CPV gave the CPV the most profound and vivid internationalist education. The Korean people's love for the CPV formed an unprecedented upsurge when the CPV withdrew from Korea. Every CPV commander and fighter who experienced it personally will never forget this deep affection of the Korean people. Like the Korean people's internationalist spirit towards the CPV, the Chinese People's Volunteers, during the eight years from sending troops to withdrawing troops, have always implemented the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao on adhering to internationalism, cherishing the Korean people, respecting the Korean government, and enhancing Sino-Korean unity, and implemented the idea that Korea only has the obligation to provide assistance and is not allowed to have the slightest thought of taking credit. This is manifested in wartime by not only closely coordinating with the Korean People's Army but also actively cooperating in combat. As long as it is beneficial to the common struggle, they never consider their own gains or losses and go all out. That is, in the joint battle, humbly learning from the strengths and experiences of the Korean People's Army and using the heroic deeds and brilliant victory of the People's Army to inspire and educate their own troops; that is, while fighting, they are rescuing the wounded and healing the sick for the residents of the war zone, rushing to plant and harvest, helping to settle down, adopting orphans, eating from the same pot, living in the same cave, and spending the most difficult times together. This spirit is also manifested after the war. The CPV actively participated in Korea's post-war reconstruction work, just like building their own motherland and hometown. The CPV cherished every mountain, river, grass, and tree of the Korean people and strived not to increase the burden on the Korean people. This internationalist thought of taking the sufferings of the Korean people as their own and the interests of the Korean people as their own, and humbly learning from the strengths and experiences of the heroic Korean people and the People's Army, is the foundation of the infinitely deep friendship between the CPV and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army! The power of this friendship and unity is invincible!
	The internationalist friendship and solidarity forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people in the anti-U.S. struggle is precious because it has not only guaranteed the victory of this common struggle, but also exposed the truth of the U.S. imperialism's paper tiger, which looks strong but is actually weak, to all the oppressed and invaded people of the world!
	On the first anniversary of the return of the Chinese People's Volunteers, let us extend our salute of peace and friendship to the leading comrades of the beloved Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, our Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms, and our Korean fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters, whom we have been separated from for a year! We wish the Chollima of Korea to gallop even faster! We wish the three thousand miles of the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea to be unified in the end!

    和平和友谊的凯歌
    ——纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战九周年与归国一周年
    杨勇
    “十·二五”作为一个为和平而斗争的胜利节日，被记载在历史上。
    九年前的今天，美帝国主义在朝鲜点燃的侵略战火正在迅速向我国东北边境延烧，美国好战集团企图吞并全部朝鲜，沿着日本军国主义的老路进攻中国，严重地威胁了世界和平。中国人民为了保家卫国拯救和平，毅然组成志愿军抗美援朝，出国作战；经过同朝鲜人民军一起英勇奋战两年九个月，终于打败美国侵略者，赢得了停战，胜利地保卫了远东与世界的和平。一年前的今天，中国人民志愿军在胜利完成抗美援朝的历史任务以后，为了促进朝鲜和平统一，又主动全部撤离了朝鲜。从志愿军出兵到撤军，为正义而奋斗的中朝人民，共同唱出了一曲和平的凯歌！
    但是，为军备生产的巨大利润所滋养起来的、醉心于保持实力地位和世界霸权的美国统治集团，继续执行冷战和加剧紧张局势的政策。中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜已经一年了，赖在南朝鲜的美国侵略军不但没有撤走，反而更加加强在南朝鲜建立原子战争基地的活动，就是一个明显的证据。
    “十·二五”，又是中朝友谊史上一个难忘的日子！
    从志愿军出国到回国，两国人民和军队在两国共产党（劳动党）领导下进行反对美国侵略、保卫和平的共同斗争中，使得有着悠久传统的中朝友谊，获得了远远超过历史上所曾经达到的那种高度，为社会主义国家相互间的新型关系提供了一个辉煌范例，显示了无产阶级国际团结的无敌力量。这种友谊在去年志愿军撤出朝鲜时，有过集中的表现，这使得全世界人民为之深深感动并传为美谈。但是更使人感动的是，就在志愿军全部撤出朝鲜之后，两国人民之间的这种友谊还仍在与日俱增地增长。在志愿军撤出朝鲜的短短一年间，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜党政代表团和由金光侠同志率领的朝鲜军事代表团两次访问中国，朝鲜人民对中国的大跃进和人民公社运动的热情关怀和支持，在中国建国十周年和志愿军归国一周年这个期间，又一次举行大规模朝中友好月活动和纪念中国人民志愿军的友谊塔的落成，以及无数朝鲜战友们在两国人民共同节日里寄来的一封封热情的信，无不更加增添着这种友谊。同样，归国的志愿军指战员，带回了朝鲜的母亲和孩子们、朝鲜的战友们对新中国对毛主席的无限热爱的一颗颗赤诚的心，和撒到祖国各个角落的土壤里的无穷花的种籽一起，把朝鲜人民的友谊播种在六亿五千万人民的心田里。今天，从鸭绿江边直到帕米尔高原的中国各族人民关心熟悉和欢呼朝鲜的千里马运动，就如同关心熟悉和欢呼自己祖国的大跃进一样。中国人民在战争年代同朝鲜人民同忧患，今天在建设社会主义的进军中，又同朝鲜人民同欢乐。中国人民和朝鲜人民的友谊，真是如兄如弟如手如足，在世界人民的友谊史上迸发着瑰丽的光彩。
    朝中人民之间如此深厚坚牢的友谊的形成和发展，还由于两国都是以马克思列宁主义的原则和无产阶级国际主义的精神对待我们的共同事业，以完全平等与互相援助互相合作精神来处理我们的相互关系。中国人民深深知道，抗美援朝正是为了保家卫国，而为了保家卫国就必须抗美援朝。朝鲜人民也深深知道，坚持抗美斗争就是对中国以及对以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的援助，是尽了朝鲜人民的国际主义义务。正是从这种无产阶级的国际主义思想出发，朝鲜劳动党、金日成元帅、共和国政府和朝鲜广大人民对志愿军如同对自己子女兄弟一样地爱护和竭尽全力地支援。志愿军在朝鲜做了一点点有益于朝鲜人民的事，他们就倍加赞扬。从战争期间直到停战以后，朝鲜人民涌现出了以安玉姬、朴在根、方兴福、方元根父子和郑山吉等为代表的无数宁愿牺牲自己以掩护和帮助志愿军的国际主义英雄人物，从飞虎山、上甘岭直到1953年夏季金城反击战役，朝鲜人民一次比一次高涨的支援志愿军的热潮，许多志愿军妈妈和拥军模范爱护志愿军的生动事迹，都给了志愿军以最深刻的活生生的国际主义教育。朝鲜人民对志愿军的热爱到志愿军撤出朝鲜时更形成一个空前的热潮。对于朝鲜人民的这种深挚情意，每个身历其境的志愿军指挥员和战斗员都是毕生难忘的。同朝鲜人民对待志愿军的国际主义精神一样，中国人民志愿军，在出兵到撤军的八年间，始终执行了中共中央和毛主席关于坚持国际主义、爱护朝鲜人民、尊重朝鲜政府、增进中朝团结的各项指示，贯彻了对朝鲜只有尽援助的义务，不允许有丝毫居功骄傲的思想。这表现在战时，就是同朝鲜人民军，不但密切配合而且主动协同作战，只要有利于共同斗争，就从不计较自己的利害得失而全力以赴；就是在并肩作战中，虚心学习朝鲜人民军的长处和经验，以人民军的英勇事迹和光辉胜利鼓舞和教育自己的部队；就是一边打仗，一边为战地居民救死扶伤，抢种抢收，帮助安家，收养孤儿，同吃一锅饭，同住一个洞，一起度过最困难的时刻。这种精神也表现在战后，志愿军像建设自己祖国和家乡一样，积极参加朝鲜的战后恢复工作。志愿军爱护朝鲜人民一山一水一草一木，力求不增加朝鲜人民的负担。这种以朝鲜人民的疾苦为自己的疾苦，以朝鲜人民的利益为自己的利益，并且虚心学习英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军的长处和经验的国际主义思想，也就是志愿军和朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军之间无限深厚友谊的基础！这种友谊和团结的力量是无敌的！
    中朝两国人民在抗美斗争中以鲜血凝成的国际主义友谊团结之所以可贵，就在于它不仅已经保证了这个共同斗争的胜利，而且向全世界一切被压迫受侵略的人民，戳穿了外强中干的美帝国主义的纸老虎真相！
  当中国人民志愿军归国一周年的时候，让我们向阔别了一年的亲爱的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府的领导同志们，朝鲜人民军战友们，朝鲜父老兄弟姊妹们，遥致以和平和友谊的敬礼！祝朝鲜的千里马加鞭疾进！祝朝鲜三千里锦绣江山的终归统一！
