　　Journey to the Frontier
　　Du Pengcheng
　　At this moment, I am situated in a small village in the middle of the desert. From the small village's loudspeaker, the sound coming from Beijing is transmitted—opposing right-leaning thought, launching a movement to increase production and practice economy. This sound reverberates over the village, the grasslands, and the desert sky. Together with the farmers and herdsmen, I gaze intently and enthusiastically at the sky, as if we are searching for the invisible and colorless radio waves, how they carry that loud sound instantaneously for thousands of miles in the sky. The moonlight is as bright as day, and the sound of camel bells comes from afar. I guess that the camel drivers must also have stopped and are listening attentively.
　　From the way people listen to that sound, I gain a vivid impression, but I still need to know what deeper things that sound stirs in people's hearts. To this end, I crossed the desert, from one oasis to another, asking farmers, asking herdsmen, asking rural women, asking grassroots cadres. Whenever I ask them questions, they point to the people who are digging canals in the desert, to the women who are busily harvesting in the autumn, to the herdsmen on the grasslands, to the laborers attacking the desert—the people who are planting trees in the autumn, as if to say, "Everything you see is the best answer." Yes, many things I have encountered in the desert area all illustrate that the working people always use their wisdom and hands to turn the Party's will into one victory after another.
　　Let me extract one thing from the many things to tell you about.
　　One day, I set off from Yulin City, which is near the Great Wall, and traveled dozens of miles south to the Dingxi Farm by the Wuding River. In the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the Party and the working people have created many miracles inside and outside the Great Wall, and this Dingxi Farm, which was opened up from the desert, is a not-small miracle among these miracles.
　　To understand how people turn yellow sand into fertile fields, one must first understand the person standing next to the rice paddy. He is not tall, but he has a thick waist and broad back, a black and red face, no different from ordinary farmers. His hands are covered in mud; his heavy cloth shoes are also full of soil. This is Farm Director Li. This person reminds me of many things. I have been away from northern Shaanxi for more than ten years. When I returned to northern Shaanxi this time, I met many northern Shaanxi cadres. Whether they are responsible comrades or grassroots cadres, you can smell the atmosphere of the land revolution, the atmosphere of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the atmosphere of the War of Liberation, and the atmosphere of ten years of construction life on them. Like the masses of northern Shaanxi, they have passed through several historical eras, always maintaining a hard-working and simple style, and always: loyal, diligent, and moving forward with confidence.
　　There are many ordinary and yet extraordinary people in the desert area who are "struggling with nature." I feel that Farm Director Li is one of these many people. I look at him. Although he looks very much like the old township chiefs of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, you can clearly see the influence of ten years of construction life on people in that strong posture, in that weathered face, and in that hand that has an inextricable bond with labor.
　　I asked, "After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee were conveyed, how is it going here?"
　　He waved his thick arms, as if wanting me to see the whole world, and said, "Hey! It's hard to explain in a few words, you come and see!"
　　I looked around, and I saw rows of willow trees and crisscrossing canals in the middle of the boundless desert. Thousands of acres of rice paddies stretched as far as the eye could see; a gentle breeze blew, and the rice swayed like a large body of water. Old Li led us onto the road in the middle of the rice paddies, grabbed all kinds of soil, and told us about the annual changes in the soil after turning the desert into fertile fields; when he grabbed that black soil and showed it to me, no one would believe that this place was a vast sea of rolling yellow sand a few years ago; what surprised me even more was that he was so familiar with the laws of desert movement, the characteristics of various plants in the desert, soil structure, fertilizer chemical composition, and so on. However, in his words, he, who was born as a hired laborer, only "picked up a few words on the road of revolution"; his scientific knowledge was all "drilled out" of this desert, just like he mastered the weapons of combat by learning while fighting back then. In the middle of the large rice paddies, there are many wide roads that cross each other. At the moment, there are no cars speeding on these roads, nor are there tractors driving; but Old Li said that they have prepared all the conditions for agricultural mechanization. On both sides of the road and on both sides of the canal bank, there are rows and rows of trees that cannot be seen to the head or tail; all the trees planted in the same year grow to the same height. It turned out that in order to be neat and uniform, they pulled the line to cultivate the trees. When he enthusiastically and vividly tells all this, you can always see how confident his face is and how rich his imagination is.
　　Next to these rice paddies, people are splitting sand dunes, leveling land, and building houses. Lacking wood, they built rows of tall stone cave dwellings; when there were not enough stones, they burned bricks themselves and used bricks to build cave dwellings. Such cave dwellings are spacious, bright, and very strong; if necessary, they can also be built in two or three stories, like buildings. This place is rich in rice, produces a large number of fish, and more than 1,300 sheep and more than 200 large livestock are grazing on the grasslands; there are countless rabbits and countless chickens and ducks; the many pigs live in one arched stone cave dwelling after another. The diet is exquisite, and the environment is hygienic. If you want to ask, are there eight hundred or a thousand pigs here? Even Farm Director Li cannot say for sure. Because there are more than 400 sows here, one group of sows gives birth to a litter in the morning, and another group of sows gives birth to a litter in the afternoon, so it is impossible to count the number for a while. When this happens, the statistician is worried; but Old Li raised his hand and shouted everywhere: "What lively days!"
　　After Old Li led us to visit all of his belongings, he pointed to the busy people in the field and said that what he is most distressed about now is that he cannot manage these workers. When it gets dark, Old Li rings the bell to summon the workers in the field to return to rest, but he almost broke the bell, and he can't summon even one person back. He was anxious, ran to the edge of the field, stomped his feet and shouted to the workers: "Are you coming back or not?" The workers said: "Old Li! What are you shouting about? We will go back when it is time to go back." Before it was light, Old Li groped to the dormitory, wanting to see how the workers were sleeping, but when he went in, he saw that there was not even one person in the dormitory. He rushed to the field and looked around, and the workers were working hard: some were carrying manure, some were weeding, and some were harvesting crops. Old Li likes his agricultural workers, and who can not like these workers who turn the desert into a prosperous world? In the past, each person planted 20 mu of paddy field, but now the workers have made an effort to plant 28 mu per person. In the past, when watering the rice fields, one person irrigated 50 mu per day, but now the workers have thought of many ways, and each person can irrigate more than 500 mu per day. In short, if you understand the courageous working spirit of these people, and look at the tenacious and simple faces of these ordinary people, you will know how deeply the thought of our Party concentrates the aspirations of the working people; you will know why we can withstand natural disasters when we encounter them; and turn the desert into an oasis when we encounter it.
　　Let us review the history of this farm. Although this history is ordinary, it can help people to understand something. In the past, this was a desert; in the middle of the desert, there was a small alkali beach. When a big wind blows, the sky is dark. The desert moves southward at a speed of two to six meters every year, as if it were an irresistible flood. In 1954, two cadres, carrying the Party's instructions, with six workers, driving a few animals, set up two or three tents in the desert here. At night, people slept on the sand in the tents, and the animals were placed in the sand outside. When it rained, they quickly pulled the animals into the tent, and people and animals slept together. Sometimes, the big wind blew the tent away, and people chased the tent and the animals in the dark night of wind and sand. At that time, when eating, sand fell into the bowl, and they dared not chew the food in their mouths at all. When food was scarce, they relied on potatoes and pumpkins for a long time. Under such living conditions, in this year, they built water conservancy projects, and then leveled 270 mu of land from the desert. The seeds were sown, but they were blown away by the wind; one sowing, two sowings, three sowings... People crawled around in the desert, and finally managed to sow the seeds. However, millet did not sprout, millet did not sprout, and the buckwheat seedlings withered as soon as they emerged from the ground. This year, the best land yielded 12 jin of grain per mu. As a result of fighting the wind and sand all year round, they lost more than 8,000 yuan. The workers had no houses to live in, could not receive wages, had no vegetables, and sometimes the potatoes they depended on for their livelihood could not be transported. At this time, some people said: "Running a farm in the desert will lose more if you plant more, lose less if you plant less, and not lose if you don't plant. Let's close the stall quickly." However, since the cadres and workers here have come to the desert, they must take root in the desert, grow in the desert, and bear fruit in the desert; hail, wind, snow, flying sand, and rocks cannot destroy their will, and cold eyes and pessimistic arguments cannot shake them. In their view, since people can get 12 jin of grain from each mu of sandy land, they can get more grain. Although 12 jin of grain is small, the belief in victory it brings to people is immeasurable. Yes, not only can we not close the stall, but we must work hard. So, in 1955, the cultivated area was expanded to 870 mu, and a large number of water conservancy projects were built to divert water to irrigate the fields. "Where there is a will, there is a way." This year, rice was planted on the land that yielded 12 jin of grain per mu, and the yield per mu was 102 jin. They, the heroes in the desert, used their chests to block the desert, used their hands to reclaim farmland and grain from the desert inch by inch, and used their actions to defeat those pessimistic and disappointed people, discouraged people, and people who poured cold water. By 1957, they had leveled another 1,960 mu of land in the desert, and the cultivated area reached 2,149 mu; this year, the average yield per mu reached more than 159 jin. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the sandy land that had been improved for three years yielded 305 jin per mu; the harvest of high-yield fields reached more than 600 jin. This year, the average yield per mu of spring wheat is 207 jin, and the highest yield per mu of winter wheat is more than 400 jin. Old Li and the others told us that, according to the pace of the Great Leap Forward, in more than three years, they will level more than 20,000 mu of land in the surrounding quicksand, afforest 70,000 mu, develop large livestock to 1,000 heads, develop pigs to 10,000 heads, and reach 10 million jin of grain. At that time, more chickens, ducks, fish, and rabbits will be raised; more sugar, wine, and chemical fertilizers will be produced.
　　We were talking vigorously with Old Li, and someone urged him to go to Yulin City to collect hundreds of thousands of fish fry; someone urged him to collect the Lanha sheep that had just been transported from Xinjiang; someone reported to him that more than a dozen sows had given birth to piglets; people from the farm's winery, brick factory, sugar factory, lime kiln, and fertilizer plant also came to ask him for instructions on various matters. Old Li, this old man, was as happy as a child. He said to us, "Look! The family business is getting bigger and bigger, and life is getting more and more vigorous." He waved his thick hands and shouted something to the cadres and workers. I feel that his huge hands and the hands of many laborers are stubbornly smearing patches of green on this yellow desert; this green color gives the desert life, makes life more brilliant, and makes the motherland more prosperous.

　　塞上行
　　杜鹏程
    此刻，我置身于沙漠当中的一个小乡村里。小乡村的扩音器里，传送出从北京来的声音——反对右倾思想，展开增产节约运动。这声音，响彻在村庄、草地和沙漠上空。我和农民、牧民们一道，专注而热情地望着天空，仿佛我们在寻找无形无色的电波，怎样带着那宏亮的声音瞬息万里地在天空中传播。月明如昼，远处传来驼铃声，我猜想，赶骆驼的人，一定也正停住脚步，聚精会神地倾听着。
    我从人们倾听那声音的姿态上，获得了一种生动的印象，可是我还需要知道，那声音在人们心里激起了什么更深刻的东西。为此，我越过沙漠，从一片绿洲走到另一片绿洲上，问农民，问牧民，问乡村妇女，问基层干部。每当我向他们提出问题时，他们就指着正在沙漠中开挖渠道的人们，指着紧张秋收的妇女，指着草滩上的牧人，指着正在向沙漠进攻的劳动者——秋季造林的人们，仿佛说：“你看到的一切，就是最好的回答。”是的，我在沙漠地带接触到的许多事情，都说明了：劳动人民总是时时用他们的智慧和双手，把党的意志变成一个又一个的胜利。
    让我从那许多事情中，抽出一件事情来讲吧。
    一天，我从长城边的榆林城出发，向南走了几十里，到了无定河边的定溪农场。十年来，特别是大跃进以来，党和劳动人民，在长城内外创造了许多奇迹，而这从沙漠中开辟出来的定溪农场，便是这奇迹中的一个不小的奇迹。
    要了解人们怎样把黄沙变成良田，必须先了解这个站在稻田旁边的人。他，个子不高，长得腰粗背宽，一副黑红的脸，与一般农民毫无二致。两手是泥；笨重的布鞋上，也满是泥土。这就是农场李场长。这个人使我想起了许多事情。我离开陕北十几年了，这次当我重返陕北时，遇到了很多陕北干部。他们不管是负责同志或者是基层干部，你从他们身上都能闻到土地革命的气息，抗日战争的气息，解放战争的气息，十年建设生活的气息。他们像陕北的群众一样，通过了好几个历史时代，始终保持着艰苦朴素的作风，始终是：忠心耿耿，勤勤恳恳，满怀信心地向前走去。
    沙漠地带有很多“与天斗争”的平凡而又平凡的人物，我觉着，李场长就是这许多人当中的一个。我打量着他，虽然他十分像当年陕甘宁边区的老乡长，可是在那健壮的姿态上，在那饱经风霜的脸上，在那和劳动结了不解之缘的手上，你都明显地看到十年来的建设生活给人的影响。
    我问：“八中全会的决议传达下来之后，你们这里搞得怎么样？”
    他挥动着粗大的胳膊，仿佛要我看整个世界似的，说：“嘿呀！三言两语说不清，你来看噢！”
    我四面眺望，只见，无边的沙漠中间柳树成行，水渠纵横。数千亩稻田望不到边；微风吹来，稻子像一片大水似的荡漾起来。老李把我们引到稻田中间的道路上，抓起各种各样的土壤，向我们讲述把沙漠变成良田之后，土壤逐年变化的情况；当他把那黑色土壤抓起来给我看时，谁也不相信这里几年以前还是黄沙滚滚的瀚海；更使我惊奇的是，他对沙漠移动的规律，沙漠中的各种植物的性格，土壤结构，肥料的化学成份等等，竟是那么熟悉。可是，用他的话说，他这个雇工出身的人，只是“在革命的道路上拣了几个字”；他的科学知识，都是从这一片沙漠里“钻出来”的；正像当年边打边学才掌握了作战武器一样。那大片大片的稻田中间，有许多十字交叉的宽阔的公路。眼下，这些公路上，没有汽车飞奔，也没有拖拉机行驶；可是老李说，他们把农业机械化的一切条件都准备好了。公路两旁，渠岸两边，栽了一排又一排望不见头也望不见尾的树木；凡是同一年栽的树，都长得一般高。原来他们为了整齐划一，都是拉起线来栽培树木的。当他热情而又活神活现地讲述这一切时，你随时看到他的脸上，闪现着多么自信的心情和丰富的幻想。
    在这些稻田旁边，人们正在劈开沙丘，平整土地，建设房屋。缺乏木料，他们就建起一排一排的高大的石窑洞；石头不够时，就自己烧砖，用砖来建筑窑洞。这样的窑洞，宽畅明亮，非常结实；必要时，还可以建设两三层，像楼房似的。这里盛产稻谷，大量出鱼，草地上牧放着一千三百多只羊和二百多头大牲口；有数不清的兔子和数不清的鸡鸭；那许多猪，都住在一个一个的拱形的石窑洞里。饮食讲究，环境卫生。若要问，这里的猪是八百头是一千头呢？连农场李场长也说不清。因为，这里光母猪就养了四百多头，上午这帮母猪生一窝，下午那帮母猪生一窝，因此，一时就统计不清数目。遇到这种情况，统计员犯愁；而老李却扬起手，四处呐喊：“好热闹的日月啊！”
    老李领着我们参观了他所有的家当以后，指着田野上忙碌的人说，他现在最苦恼的是无法管理这些工人。天黑了，老李敲着钟，召唤田间的工人，要他们归来休息，但是他快把钟敲破了，连一个人也召唤不回来。他急了，跑到田边上跺着脚向工人们喊：“你们回来不回来？”工人们说：“老李！你嚷叫什么？该回去的时候我们就回去了。”天还不明，老李摸到宿舍，想看看工人们睡得怎么样，可是，进去一看，宿舍里连一个人也没有。他赶到田野上举目四望，工人们都紧张地工作着：有的在挑粪，有的在拔草，有的在割庄稼。老李喜欢他的农业工人，而谁又能不喜欢这些把沙漠变成繁华世界的工人呢？过去，每一个人种二十亩水地，现在工人鼓了一把劲，每人种二十八亩。过去往稻田放水，一个人每天灌五十亩，现在工人们想了很多办法，每人每天可灌五百多亩。总之，你了解一下这些人奋勇的劳动劲头，看看这些普通人坚韧而淳朴的容颜，你就知道我们党的思想是怎样深切地集中了劳动人民的愿望；你就知道我们为什么能碰到天灾，就把天灾抗住；遇到沙漠，就把沙漠变成绿洲。
    让我们回顾一下这个农场的历史吧。这段历史虽然平凡，但是他可以帮助人颖悟到一些东西。过去，这里是一片沙漠；沙漠中间夹着一块小碱滩。一起大风，天昏地暗。沙漠每年以二至六米的速度向南移动着，仿佛是不可抗拒的滔天洪水似的。1954年，两个干部带着党的嘱托，带着六个工人，赶着几头牲口，在这里的沙漠中搭起了两三顶帐篷。夜晚人们睡在帐篷中的沙地上，牲口放在外边的沙地里。一下雨，连忙把牲口拉进帐篷，人和牲口睡到一块。有时候，大风把帐篷刮走了，人们在风沙漫天的黑夜中，追赶帐篷，追赶牲口。那工夫，吃饭的时候，沙子落在碗内，饭到口里根本不敢嚼。粮食缺的时候，长时期就靠洋芋和南瓜过日子。就在这种生活条件下，这一年，他们兴修水利，然后，又从沙漠中平整出二百七十亩土地。种子下进去，被风刮走了；一次下种，二次下种，三次下种……人们在沙漠里爬来爬去，好容易才把种子下进去了。可是种谷子谷子不出苗，种糜子糜子不出苗，荞麦苗刚露出地面，也就枯干了。这一年，最好的田地，亩产十二斤粮食。整年和风沙搏斗的结果，赔了八千多元。工人们没有房子住，领不到工资，没有菜蔬，赖以维持生活的洋芋有时候也运不来。这时候就有人说话了：“在沙漠里办农场是多种多赔，少种少赔，不种不赔，赶快收摊子吧。”但是，这里的干部和工人们，既然到了沙漠里，就要在沙漠里扎根，就要在沙漠里生长，就要在沙漠里开花结果；冰雹，风雪，飞砂走石，摧毁不了他们的意志，冷眼旁观和悲观论调，也无法动摇他们。在他们看来，人既然能从每亩沙地里捞到十二斤粮食，那就可以捞到更多的粮食。十二斤粮食虽然少，但是他带给人的胜利信念却是无法估量的。是的，不仅不能收摊子，而且要大干。于是，1955年，耕地面积扩大到八百七十亩，大量地兴修水利，引水浇田。“有志者事竟成”，这一年，在那每亩收获十二斤粮食的土地上种上稻子，亩产一百零二斤。他们，沙漠中的英雄们，用自己的胸膛挡住沙漠，用自己的双手一寸一寸地向沙漠要田地、要粮食，用自己的行动，击败了那些悲观失望的人、泄气的人、泼凉水的人。到了1957年，他们又在沙漠地里平整出一千九百六十亩土地，耕地面积达到二千一百四十九亩；这一年，平均亩产达到了一百五十九斤多。1958年大跃进中，改良过三年的沙地，亩产达到三百零五斤；丰产田的收成达到六百多斤。今年，春小麦平均亩产二百零七斤，冬小麦最高亩产达到四百余斤。老李他们告诉我们，按照大跃进的步伐，再走三年多，他们就要在周围的流沙中，平整出二万多亩土地，造林七万亩，大牲畜发展到一千头，猪发展到一万头，粮食达到一千万斤。那时，将要养更多的鸡、鸭、鱼、兔；将出产更多的糖、酒和化学肥料。
    我们正和老李谈得起劲，有人催他去榆林城里领数十万尾鱼苗；有人催他去领刚从新疆运来的兰哈羊；有人向他报告：又有十几个母猪生养小猪了；农场里的酒厂、砖厂、糖厂、石灰窑和化肥厂里来的人，也相继向他请示各种事情。老李这位上了年纪的人，乐得像个孩子似的，他对我们说：“看！家业越来越大了，光景越过越有劲。”他挥动着粗大的手，向干部和工人们喊着什么。我觉得，他那双巨大的手和那许多劳动者的手，顽强地在这黄色的沙漠上，涂抹着片片绿颜色；这绿颜色使沙漠获得生命，使生活更加光彩，使祖国更加繁荣。
