    Objective things are constantly in motion and developing.
    In our country, the Party's general line for building socialism has inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses and mobilized their strength. Therefore, the development of all aspects of work is particularly rapid. The advanced become more advanced; the backward quickly catch up with or surpass the advanced. The Ninth Middle School of Changchun City, which originally had low teaching quality, has become an advanced school with the highest teaching quality in the city, which is a good example.
    "A long journey begins with a single step," and "One must climb up from the lowest place to reach the highest." The low place is often the starting point for reaching the high place. It should be said that it is a normal phenomenon to conscientiously implement the Party's education policy and transform schools with low teaching quality into schools with high teaching quality. However, some schools emphasize poor conditions, lack enthusiasm, and dare not change; some schools believe that they are already high enough and do not need to change. Therefore, the leap-forward improvement and the huge change like that of Changchun Ninth Middle School is very valuable.
    Where does the huge change come from? In a nutshell: putting politics in command.
    The Party's putting politics in command is inseparable from the mass line and from mobilizing the masses. Implementing putting politics in command and following the mass line is essentially a high regard for the consciousness, initiative, and creativity of the masses. Changchun Ninth Middle School adheres to putting politics in command, calling on the broad masses of teachers to cultivate talents of higher quality for the motherland, constantly developing and fully exerting revolutionary consciousness, and organizing forces to overcome various difficult conditions. The teachers' morale is boosted, and their enthusiasm is greater. Therefore, they pushed their school to the peak of advancement and won glory for the school. If the situation were different, and the consciousness, initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of teachers were not seen, and their positive factors were not mobilized, and they lingered and waited in the face of negative factors, it would be impossible to change the backward situation, and moreover, it would go to the opposite, becoming even more backward. It can be seen that the secret of change lies in maximizing the subjective initiative of people to master objective laws and fully utilize existing conditions.
    Of course, to implement putting politics in command in schools, political work must be combined with teaching work, and putting politics in command must be implemented in the teaching of all scientific and cultural knowledge. Only under the guidance of the political and ideological work of the proletariat can teaching work move forward better. This is just like combining political work with economic work in construction. Changchun Ninth Middle School, while paying attention to giving play to the teachers' consciousness, initiative, and creativity, has made a series of arrangements in teaching business, organizing them to strengthen professional advanced studies and strive for teaching practice, so that the spear is pointed, and pointed accurately; the strength is used, and used appropriately. Implementing putting politics in command in the teaching of all scientific and cultural knowledge makes it possible for teaching work to be carried out more effectively, to fully grasp the laws of teaching work, and to improve teaching quality.
    Motion is infinite, and the upstream is endless. Like climbing a mountain, when we climb a peak, we will see another higher peak. Indeed, there are mountains beyond mountains, and heavens beyond heavens. Changchun Ninth Middle School has already climbed a peak, and it will climb a higher peak. Those who oppose putting politics in command in schools, oppose following the mass line, exaggerate difficulties, shrink back, and have right-leaning conservative ideas can learn from the tremendous changes in Changchun Ninth Middle School! Let the broad masses of schools sweep away right-leaning conservative ideas and complete the transformation to new peaks on their own foundations!

    变

    客观事物经常在运动着、发展着。
    在我们国家里，党的建设社会主义总路线鼓舞了广大群众的干劲，动员了广大群众的力量，因此各方面的工作的发展就特别迅速。先进的更加先进；落后的迅速赶上先进或者超过先进。原来教学质量低的长春市第九中学，变成了全市教学质量最高的先进学校，就是一个好的例子。
    “行远必自迩”，“登高必自卑”。低的地方，往往是向高的地方的出发点。认真贯彻党的教育方针，把教学质量低的学校，变为教学质量高的学校，应该说是正常的现象。但是，有的学校强调条件不好，干劲不足，不敢变；有的学校认为自己已经高了，不要变。所以，像长春市第九中学的跃进式的提高，来一个巨大的变化，就十分可贵了。
    巨大的变化从何而来呢？一言以蔽之曰：政治挂帅。
    党的政治挂帅，是同群众路线分不开的，是同发动群众分不开的。实行政治挂帅，走群众路线，实质上就是对群众的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的高度重视。长春市第九中学，坚持政治挂帅，号召广大教师为祖国培养质量更高的人才，不断发展并充分发挥革命的自觉，组织力量去克服各种困难条件，教师们的气鼓起来了，劲头大了，于是，就把自己的学校推向先进的高峰，为学校争光。如果换了另一种情况，看不到广大教师的觉悟性、积极性、创造性，不去调动他们中的积极因素，在消极因素面前徘徊观望，那就不可能改变落后的形势，而且，还要走向它的反面，变向更加落后。可以看到，变的个中奥妙，在于最大限度地发挥人的主观能动作用，来掌握客观规律，充分利用现有条件。
    当然，在学校中实行政治挂帅，就要把政治工作同教学工作结合起来，在一切科学文化知识的教学工作中，实行政治挂帅。只有在无产阶级的政治思想工作的指导下，教学工作才会更好地前进。这也正如同在建设中，要把政治工作同经济工作结合起来一样。长春市第九中学，在注意发挥教师的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的同时，在教学业务上作了一系列的安排，组织他们加强业务进修，努力教学实践，使得矛有所指，指得准确；力有所用，用之得当。在一切科学文化知识的教学工作中实行政治挂帅，就有可能使得教学工作更加有成效地进行，充分掌握教学工作的规律，提高教学质量。
    运动是无穷的，上游是无止境的。犹如登山，当我们登上一个山峰的时候，便会望到另一个更高的高峰。正是，山外有山，天外有天。长春市第九中学已经登上了一个高峰，它还会攀上更高的高峰。那种反对在学校中实行政治挂帅，反对走群众路线，夸大困难，畏缩不前，具有右倾保守思想的人，从长春市第九中学的巨大变化中，可以得到教益了吧！让广大学校都来横扫右倾保守思想，个个都在自己的基础上，完成向新的高峰的转变吧！
