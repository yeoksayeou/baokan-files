　　From No Railways to Extensive Networks
    Lanzhou Becomes a Railway Hub in Northwest China
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 10th: Lanzhou, which had no railways before liberation, has become an important railway hub in Northwest China. Approximately 3,000 freight cars are assembled and disassembled here daily, and over 6 million tons of goods were handled in the first nine months of this year, powerfully supporting the Great Leap Forward in various parts of the Northwest.

    Lanzhou is not only the terminus of the Longhai Railway, but also, from here, taking the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, one can reach Weiya in Xinjiang; northward, through the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, it connects with Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. The newly built Lanzhou-Xining Railway has recently opened to traffic at the Great Leap Forward speed to Xining. The Lanzhou-Liujiaxia railway has already started construction. On both sides of the railway trunk lines, dozens of railway branch lines and dedicated lines are connected, initially forming a railway network, with Lanzhou as the heart of this network. Freight cars transported on the various trunk lines, branch lines, and dedicated lines are reassembled here and then dispatched to various places; freight trains coming from various places are also disassembled and assembled here, and then dispatched to Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Ningxia.

    "Go to the Great Northwest" no longer means distant and difficult. Whether departing from Shanghai or Beijing, passenger trains now bring passengers to Lanzhou in about two days, from where they transfer to various parts of the Northwest.

    The Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, which was laid to Lanzhou East Station in August 1952, was the first railway to appear on the Lanzhou city map. In the first few years after the Longhai Railway reached Lanzhou, the transportation volume of Lanzhou Station was small, and the goods transported out were also few. In recent years, the economy of the Northwest region has developed rapidly. Yumen Oilfield has been built as China's first natural petroleum base; the Qaidam Basin and Karamay have also begun to produce crude oil. New factories in Lanzhou, Urumqi, Xining and other places have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Cotton cloth woven in Urumqi, milk powder produced in Xining, and fertilizers, gasoline, lubricating oil, oil extraction machinery, oil pumps, cement, blankets, wool fabrics, etc. produced in Lanzhou are now transported in batches through Lanzhou Station to various places. Since the beginning of this year, industrial products loaded at Lanzhou Station and transferred to all parts of the country have averaged more than 200 freight cars per day.

    In order to adapt to the continuous development of transportation business, the Lanzhou Railway Hub is trying its best to organize direct transportation over long distances, and also strengthens the turnover of freight trains over short distances. A vibrant red flag competition has been launched among various departments, the number of over-axle locomotives is increasing, and transportation efficiency has been greatly improved. The volume of freight transported in the first nine months of this year alone exceeded four times the volume transported in the entire year of 1953.

    Currently, at the intersection of several railway trunk lines, the large-scale Lanzhou Railway Hub project is being accelerated. Vehicle depots, locomotive depots, two marshalling yards, eight stations, and three passenger platforms have already been built and put into production. In the future, the Lanzhou Railway Hub will also build a wheel and axle factory, two modern hump marshalling stations, and install automated traffic signals and mechanized loading equipment.

### 从没有铁路到四通八达  兰州已成西北地区铁路枢纽

　　从没有铁路到四通八达
    兰州已成西北地区铁路枢纽
    新华社兰州10日电　解放前没有铁路的兰州，已经成为西北地区重要的铁路枢纽。这里每天要编组和解体三千个左右的火车皮，今年头九个月吞吐的货物就有六百余万吨，有力地支援了西北各地的大跃进。
    兰州不仅是陇海铁路的终点，从这里坐上兰新铁路的火车，可以直到新疆境内的尾哑；向北通过包兰铁路和宁夏、内蒙古相联接，新建的兰青铁路已经以大跃进的速度最近通车到西宁。兰州至刘家峡的铁路已经动工兴建。在铁路干线的两旁，联接着几十条铁路支线和专用线，初步形成一个铁路网，兰州就是这个铁路网的心脏。各干线支线专用线上运来的货车，在这里经过重新编组然后开往各地；从各地开来的货物列车，也在这里解体和编组，然后开往甘肃、青海、新疆和宁夏。
    “到大西北去”，现在已不再意味着遥远和艰难，无论从上海或北京出发，只要两天左右时间，客车就把旅客带到兰州，由这里再转往西北各地。
    1952年8月铺轨到兰州东站的陇海铁路天（水）兰（州）段，是兰州市地图上出现的第一条铁路。陇海铁路刚通到兰州的头几年里，兰州车站运输量较小，运出的货物也较少。近几年来，西北地区的经济有了迅速发展。玉门油矿已建成为我国第一个天然石油基地；柴达木盆地和克拉玛依也开始出产原油。兰州、乌鲁木齐、西宁等地，新工厂已像雨后春笋般建立起来，乌鲁木齐织造的棉布，西宁出产的奶粉，兰州生产的化肥、汽油、润滑油、采油机械、油泵、水泥、毛毯、呢料等等，现在已成批地通过兰州车站运销各地。今年以来，由兰州车站装车转运全国各地的工业品平均每天超过两百个车皮。
    兰州铁路枢纽为了适应运输业务不断发展的需要，在远距离运输上尽量组织直达运输，在短距离内也加强了货物列车的周转。各部门间开展了热火朝天的红旗竞赛，超轴的机车越来越多，运输效率大大提高。仅今年头九个月来的货物运输量，就超过1953年全年运量的四倍。
    目前，在几条铁路干线会合的地方，正在加速建设规模巨大的兰州铁路枢纽工程。现在已经建成投入生产的有车辆段、机务段、两个编组场、八个车站和三个旅客乘降所。今后兰州铁路枢纽还要修筑一个轮轴工厂、两个现代化的驼峰调车站，安装自动化的行车信号和装车的机械化设备。
