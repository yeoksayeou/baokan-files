Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw Telegram:  Polish state-owned farms have achieved significant increases in production by giving play to the enthusiasm of workers and establishing an economic accounting system.

Currently, there are more than 3,000 state-owned farms in Poland, with 2.5 million hectares of cultivated land, accounting for 12% of the country's total cultivated land area. According to materials released here, this year, with a quarter fewer employees on state-owned farms compared to 1956, labor productivity has increased by 40%.

The per-unit area yield of land on state-owned farms has also increased significantly. This year, the total value of marketable grain produced per hectare of land has increased from 1,482 zlotys (Polish currency) in 1956 to 1,768 zlotys, and the total value of livestock products has increased from 836 zlotys to 946 zlotys.

The amount of grain and milk turned over to the state has also increased significantly. Last year, state-owned farms turned over only 442,000 tons of grain to the state, but this year it has increased to 565,000 tons, and milk reached 565 million liters, compared to only 420 million liters in 1956.

Due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity, state-owned farms with better management, such as those in Warsaw Province, have achieved a surplus of 13 million zlotys this year.

　　发挥职工积极性　建立经济核算制
    波兰国营农场生产显著增长
    新华社华沙电　波兰国营农场由于发挥了职工的积极性，和建立了经济核算制，生产有了显著的提高。
    现在波兰全国共有三千多个国营农场，拥有耕地二百五十万公顷，占全国耕地总面积的12％。根据此间公布的材料，今年，在国营农场职工人数比1956年减少四分之一的情况下，劳动生产率增长了40％。
    国营农场土地的单位面积产量也有很大的增加。今年，每公顷土地生产的商品粮食的总值已从1956年的一千四百八十二兹罗提（波币）提高到一千七百六十八兹罗提，畜产品总值从八百三十六兹罗提上升到九百四十六个兹罗提。
    上缴给国家的粮食和牛奶的数量也大大地增加了。去年国营农场缴给国家的粮食仅四十四万二千吨，而今年已增加到五十六万五千吨，牛奶达五亿六千五百万公升，而1956年仅四亿二千万公升。
    由于劳动生产率的不断提高，经营比较好的国营农场，如华沙省的国营农场，今年已经获得了一千三百万兹罗提的盈余。
