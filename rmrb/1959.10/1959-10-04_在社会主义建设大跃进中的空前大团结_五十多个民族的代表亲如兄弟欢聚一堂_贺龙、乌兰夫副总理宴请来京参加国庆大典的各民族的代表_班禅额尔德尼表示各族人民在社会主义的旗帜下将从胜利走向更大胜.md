Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Vice Premiers of the State Council, He Long and Ulanhu, hosted a banquet at the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People today at noon to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, with representatives of more than fifty ethnic groups attending.

Panchen Erdeni Chos-kyi Gyal-tsen, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Vice Chairmen Phagpalha Geleg Namgyal, and Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, who is also Secretary-General, attended today's banquet.

More than 1,100 people attended today's banquet, including all members of the sixteen minority ethnic group visiting delegations and three minority ethnic group youth study groups from all over the country, as well as minority ethnic people in Beijing.

The representatives of all ethnic groups, dressed in bright ethnic costumes, gathered together like brothers on this festive day of the motherland, and the magnificent banquet hall was filled with joy.

Vice Premier He Long delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet, saying: "On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 1,100 representatives of more than fifty minority ethnic groups across the country, bringing the infinite love and respect of nearly 40 million minority ethnic people for the great motherland, the Communist Party, and the great leader Chairman Mao, have come to the capital to participate in the National Day celebration. This fully demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Here, with great pleasure, we extend a warm welcome to all the representatives and comrades of the ethnic group delegations."

He said: "Over the past decade, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, our country has achieved brilliant victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Ethnic work, like other work, has also achieved great successes. The work of establishing autonomous regions and autonomous organs in minority ethnic group areas across the country has been basically completed. According to the provisions of the Constitution, all minority ethnic groups in concentrated settlements have realized the right to manage their own internal affairs and be masters of their own affairs. The equal rights of all minority ethnic groups living in mixed and scattered communities have also been fully guaranteed. All minority ethnic areas have completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation, and have basically realized the people's commune system. The people of the Tibet region are also carrying out a vigorous democratic reform movement under the leadership of the Party. With the strong help of the state and the Han people, and through the hard work of the minority ethnic people, the economic and cultural construction of all ethnic areas has developed by leaps and bounds, and people's lives have been significantly improved. With the continuous victory of the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, profound changes have also taken place in the relations between all ethnic groups in our country. The socialist ethnic relations of great unity, great cooperation, common labor, and common development among the people of all ethnic groups have developed rapidly, and the unity of the motherland has been consolidated like steel on the basis of socialism. Our great motherland has become a socialist family of equality, unity, friendship, cooperation, and common development among all ethnic groups."

Vice Premier He Long said: "All these achievements are the result of the united efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, the task before the people of all ethnic groups in our country is to develop social productive forces at high speed according to the Party's general line of building socialism, and to strive to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen, twenty, or a little longer years. This is a glorious and great task. The realization of this task will fundamentally change the backward economic and cultural conditions of all ethnic areas in our country, and achieve complete equality and common prosperity of all ethnic groups in economic and cultural terms." He called on the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to forge ahead valiantly to victoriously complete this great historical task!

Panchen Erdeni Chos-kyi Gyal-tsen, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said at the banquet: "For ten years, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's great ethnic policy, the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially our minority ethnic groups, with the strong support and assistance of the Han people, have gradually and rapidly achieved great victories in democratic reform and socialist transformation. The social productive forces in minority ethnic areas, which were in various stages of historical development and under various exploitative systems, have been thoroughly liberated. From then on, the people of all ethnic groups, under the banner of socialism, closely united in the great family of the motherland, and victoriously advance together to build a socialist happy life."

He said: "The broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people in the Tibet region of the motherland are closely following the steps of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, and are forging ahead bravely! No reactionary force can absolutely stop the Tibetan people from taking the road of progress. The counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet in March this year has completely failed. With the failure of this counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, the broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people have launched a earth-shaking and vigorous democratic reform movement. After rapidly and thoroughly eliminating the oppression and exploitation of the feudal serf system, the million monks and lay people of Tibet will smoothly embark on the road of building socialism, will thoroughly get rid of suffering and poverty, and will step into the socialist and communist paradise of happiness for all beings. In this way, the desire and purpose of 'saving all living beings' as indicated by our Buddhist teachings will also be gradually realized!"

Finally, he suggested that everyone toast to advancing together under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the banner of socialism, advancing from victory to greater victory!

Choike Tondup Tsering, head of the Tibetan visiting delegation, spoke on behalf of the minority ethnic group visiting delegations at the banquet. He said: "We, the representatives of all minority ethnic groups, feel very honored to come to the capital to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. Over the past decade, under the guidance of the Party's great ethnic policy, the people of all our minority ethnic groups have realized ethnic regional autonomy, developed economic and cultural construction, and trained a large number of political cadres and a portion of professional and technical cadres, which has greatly changed the poor and backward conditions of all minority ethnic groups. Now, democratic reforms have been realized in 95% of the areas where minority ethnic groups live, and decisive victories have been achieved in the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, the people's commune system has basically been realized, which has greatly accelerated the speed of socialist construction of all minority ethnic groups, and strengthened ethnic unity and the unification of the motherland. The Tibetan people are now also carrying out a vigorous democratic reform movement under the leadership of the Party, and a new page has been opened in the history of Tibet. All these achievements are due to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the selfless assistance of the Han elder brother and the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups are filled with infinite love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the future, we must unite more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the Party's general line, jointly strive to build the cause of socialism."

At the banquet, representatives of all ethnic groups repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate our great motherland on its prosperity and strength, to congratulate the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups, and to congratulate the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, on his longevity.

Among those present at today's banquet were ministers or vice ministers of various ministries of the State Council, Vice Chairmen of the Ethnic Affairs Commission Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, Xie Hechou, Deputy Chairmen of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress Bao Erhan, Xie Fumin, President of the Buddhist Association of China Shirob Jaltso, Deputy Director of the Islamic Association Da Puhsheng, heads of various people's organizations, and Deputy Secretaries of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China Tan Guansan, Zhou Renshan, and others.

    新华社3日讯　国务院副总理贺龙、乌兰夫今天中午在人民大会堂宴会厅欢宴来京参加建国十周年庆祝大典的五十多个民族的代表。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞和副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛、副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美出席了今天的宴会。
    出席今天宴会的有来自全国各地的十六个少数民族观礼团和三个少数民族青年学习团的全体团员以及在京的少数民族人士，共有一千一百多人。
    穿着鲜艳民族服装的各民族代表在这祖国喜庆的日子里欢聚一堂，亲如兄弟，辉煌的宴会大厅一片喜气洋洋。
    贺龙副总理在宴会开始时致词说：“在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，全国五十多个少数民族的一千一百多位代表，带着近四千万少数民族人民对伟大祖国、对共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和敬意，来到首都参加国庆典礼，这充分显示了我国各民族人民在社会主义建设大跃进中的空前大团结。在这里，我们以非常愉快的心情，向各民族代表团的各位代表和同志们，表示热烈的欢迎。”
    他说：“十年来，我们的国家在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌胜利。民族工作和其他工作一样，也取得了伟大的成就。全国少数民族聚居地区建立自治地方和自治机关的工作已经基本完成了。各聚居的少数民族根据宪法规定实现了在管理本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利。一切杂居和散居少数民族的平等权利也都得到了充分的保障。各少数民族地区已经完成了民主改革和社会主义改造，并且基本上实现了人民公社化。西藏地区的人民群众也正在党的领导下，进行着轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动。在国家和汉族人民的大力帮助下，经过少数民族人民的辛勤劳动，各民族地区的经济和文化建设事业都有了飞跃的发展，人民生活有了显著的改善和提高。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的不断胜利，我国各民族之间的关系也发生了深刻的变化。各民族人民大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同发展的社会主义民族关系得到了迅速的发展，祖国的统一也在社会主义基础上钢铁一般地巩固起来了。我们伟大的祖国已经成为各民族平等团结、友爱合作、共同发展的社会主义大家庭。”
    贺龙副总理说：“所有这些成就，都是我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，共同努力的结果。现在，摆在我国各民族人民面前的任务，就是要根据党的建设社会主义总路线，高速度地发展社会生产力，争取在十五年、二十年或者更长一点时间内，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。这是一个光荣的伟大的任务。实现了这个任务，也就能够从根本上改变我国各民族地区的经济文化落后面貌，达到各民族在经济文化上的完全平等和共同繁荣。”他号召各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为胜利完成这个伟大的历史任务而奋勇前进！
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞在宴会上讲话说：“十年来，在党的伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，全国各族人民，特别是我们少数民族，在汉族的大力支持和帮助下，逐步地、迅速地取得了民主改革和社会主义改造的伟大胜利，处于各个历史发展阶段和各种剥削制度下的少数民族地区的社会生产力，得到了彻底的解放。从此，各族人民在社会主义的旗帜下，亲密团结在祖国大家庭里，为建设社会主义幸福生活而共同胜利地前进。”
    他说：“祖国西藏地区的广大藏族僧俗人民，紧跟着各兄弟民族人民的步伐，大踏步地在奋勇前进着！任何反动势力，绝对阻挡不了西藏人民走进步的道路。今年3月间，西藏上层反动集团发动的一场反革命武装叛乱，彻底地失败了。随着这场反革命武装叛乱的失败，西藏广大僧俗人民已展开了一个翻天复地的、轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动。西藏百万僧俗人民在迅速彻底地消灭封建农奴制度的压迫和剥削以后，将顺利地走上建设社会主义的道路，将彻底解脱痛苦和贫困，将步入众生幸福的社会主义和共产主义极乐大道。如此，像我们佛家教义所指示的‘普渡众生’的愿望和目的，也将一定逐步予以实现！”
    最后，他建议大家为在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义的旗帜下，共同团结前进，从胜利走向更大的胜利而干杯！
    西藏观礼团团长崔科·顿珠泽仁代表各少数民族观礼团在宴会上讲话。他说：“我们各少数民族的代表团到首都参加我们伟大祖国成立十周年的国庆大典，感到非常荣幸。十年来我们各少数民族人民在党的伟大的民族政策的指引下，实现了民族区域自治，发展了经济文化的建设事业，并且培养了大批的政治干部和一部分专业技术干部，这就使各少数民族大大改变了贫困落后的面貌。现在，全国各少数民族总人口95％的地区，都实现了民主改革，并在经济、政治、思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，在全国大跃进的形势下又基本实现人民公社化，大大地加快了各少数民族建设社会主义的速度，加强了民族团结和祖国的统一。西藏人民现在也正在党的领导下，进行着轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动，西藏的历史揭开了新的一页。这一切的成就都是由于有了党和毛主席的正确领导，及汉族老大哥的无私援助和各族人民的努力而得来的。各族人民对共产党和毛主席充满了无限热爱。今后我们要更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，在党的总路线的指引下，共同为建设社会主义的事业而奋斗。”
    在宴会上，各民族代表一再举杯祝贺我们伟大的祖国繁荣昌盛，祝贺各民族人民的大团结，祝贺各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。
