Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Coal industry workers across the country realized the slogan of "October Surpassing September" with continuous leaps forward. By October 26th, the national raw coal output had exceeded the October production plan by one million tons five days ahead of schedule. The total output of the eighteen key coal washing plants across the country also completed the monthly plan two days ahead of schedule.

The average daily output of raw coal nationwide increased by 4.6% in the first twenty-six days of October compared to the same period in September, which itself had surged by 24.6% compared to August, achieving even greater areas of high yield. The most important characteristic of national raw coal production in October was the achievement of sustained and balanced high output. The curve in the scheduling room of the Ministry of Coal Industry showing the daily raw coal output indicates that October was the most balanced month for raw coal production this year. The daily output of coal nationwide exceeded the daily plan every day. In terms of coal mines, the vast majority of the fifty-four key bureaus and mines across the country achieved "daily red," exceeding the daily plan. At the same time, the national coal mine tunneling work also completed the plan on a ten-day basis, creating important conditions for the sustained high output of the coal industry. The fact that national raw coal has achieved sustained high output and a double leap in mining and tunneling shows that while China's coal industry has made a great leap forward in output this year, the management of enterprises has also been strengthened.

From October 1st to 29th, the average daily output of the eighteen key coal washing plants across the country increased by 1.5% compared to September, and the quality of coal washing also improved, especially the quality of coal washing supplied to large steel enterprises. For example, the ash content of the washed coal supplied by Shuangyashan, Lingshan, and Taiji coal washing plants to Anshan Iron and Steel decreased by 0.29% to 0.37% compared to September. The ash content of the washed coal supplied by Hongshan and Pingxiang coal washing plants to Wuhan Iron and Steel decreased by about 0.8%.

In recent days, coal industry workers across the country have been increasing the production of raw coal and washed coal for the country, while also stepping up production preparation work in order to achieve greater results in November.

    提前五天超额百万吨完成月计划
    全国采煤手立大功
    日产比九月增长百分之四点六
    新华社29日讯　全国煤炭工业职工实现了“10月胜过9月”的不断跃进的口号，到10月26日止，全国原煤产量提前五天超额一百万吨完成了10月份生产计划；全国十八个重点洗煤厂的总产量也提前两天完成了月计划。
    全国原煤的平均日产量，在9月比8月猛增24.6％的基础上，10月份前二十六天又比9月同期增长了4.6％，获得了更大面积的高产。10月份全国原煤生产最主要的特点是做到了持续的均衡的高产。煤炭工业部调度室内表示每天原煤产量情况的曲线表明，10月份是今年以来原煤生产最均衡的一个月。全国煤炭的日产量，天天超额完成日计划。以煤矿来说，全国五十四个重点局、矿中，绝大多数做到了“日日红”，超额完成了日计划。与此同时，全国煤矿的掘进工作也按旬完成了计划，为煤炭工业持续的高产创造了重要条件。全国原煤达到持续高产和采掘双跃进这一事实表明，我国煤炭工业今年在产量大跃进的同时，企业的管理工作也加强了。
    10月份到29日止，全国十八个重点洗煤厂的平均日产量比9月份增长了1.5％，洗煤的质量也有提高，特别是供应大型钢铁企业的洗煤质量显著提高。如双鸭山、灵山和台吉洗煤厂供应鞍钢的洗煤，所含的灰分比9月份减少了0.29％到0.37％；洪山和萍乡洗煤厂供应武钢的洗煤所含的灰分减少了0.8％左右。
    最近几天，全国煤炭工业的职工，一方面在为国家增产更多的原煤和洗煤；一方面又加紧进行生产准备工作，争取11月份获得更大的成绩。
