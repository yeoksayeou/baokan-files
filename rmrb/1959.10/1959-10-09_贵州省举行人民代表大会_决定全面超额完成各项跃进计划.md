Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 8th - The Second Session of the Second People's Congress of Guizhou Province recently concluded. At the meeting, 280 representatives of various ethnic groups from across the province listened to, discussed, and approved the government work report, the report on Guizhou Province's 1958 financial statement and the draft 1959 financial budget, and the work report of the Higher People's Court. The representatives excitedly summarized the great victory of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes in 1958, summarized the new achievements of the first eight months of this year, and expressed their confidence that they would continue to hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. They united and encouraged the people of the province to continue to deepen the movement for increasing production and practicing economy under the correct leadership of the Party, ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's production and construction tasks in Guizhou Province.

In 1958, Guizhou Province achieved brilliant and comprehensive achievements in the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and other socialist construction undertakings. The total output value of industry and agriculture rose sharply, reaching more than 3.75 billion yuan. The total increase was equal to one and a half times the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period. The actual harvest of grain in the province last year reached 15 billion jin, and the absolute increase was equivalent to the total increase in the eight years from 1949 to 1957. In terms of industry, Guizhou Province, which did not produce even one jin of steel before last year, produced 10,000 tons of modern steel (a total of 84,000 tons including native steel) and 40,000 tons of modern iron (a total of 600,000 tons including native iron) in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. There was an even greater leap forward this year compared to last year. More than 100 new products that could not be produced in the past, such as complete sets of small blast furnace equipment below 55 cubic meters, all-gear lathes, and 180-kilowatt motors, can now be manufactured by ourselves. Transportation has greatly developed, changing the backward state of transportation in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. Other work has also greatly developed.

Encouraged by these brilliant achievements, the representatives felt infinitely excited. During group discussions or speeches at the general meeting, they also used a large number of specific and vivid facts to vehemently denounce the slander of the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the mass steelmaking movement by reactionary factions at home and abroad and right-leaning opportunists. The representatives unanimously pointed out that if Guizhou, a province with little iron and no steel, had not mobilized the masses to make steel on a large scale, it would not have been possible to end the history of having no steel last year, nor would it have been possible to complete the province's annual modern steel production plan ahead of schedule before this year's National Day. The representative of the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory said that because they can make their own steel, they have gotten rid of the passive situation of relying on Shanghai, Kunming, and other places for the supply of steel castings. The representatives, especially those from ethnic minority mountainous areas, unanimously emphasized in their speeches that without the People's Communes, it would have been completely impossible to overcome this year's unprecedentedly severe natural disasters and maintain or increase grain crop production on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. Wang Yaolun (Miao nationality), a National People's Congress representative, said that Jianhe County, which was known as "cold water, withered grass, barren land, and poor people" in the past, had actually achieved a large-scale, high-yield bumper harvest of rice this year, greatly advancing and exceeding the targets of the Agricultural Development Program. Such a great leap forward in high-altitude mountainous areas would not have been possible without the powerful strength of the People's Communes.

On the basis of summing up achievements and reviewing the past, the representatives were filled with greater confidence in building the motherland and building Guizhou. The congress passed a resolution, unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Tenth Plenary Session of the First Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, to lead the people of all ethnic groups in the province to further develop the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, and to strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's various Great Leap Forward plans.

### 贵州省举行人民代表大会  决定全面超额完成各项跃进计划

    贵州省举行人民代表大会
    决定全面超额完成各项跃进计划
    新华社贵阳8日电　贵州省第二届人民代表大会第二次会议，已在最近闭幕。会上，来自全省的二百八十位各族代表，听取、讨论和通过了政府工作报告以及贵州省1958年财政决算和1959年财政预算草案报告、高级人民法院工作报告。代表们兴奋地总结了1958年大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，总结了今年头八个月来的新成就，信心百倍地表示要继续高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，团结一致、鼓舞全省人民在党的正确领导下，继续深入开展增产节约运动，保证完成和超额完成今年贵州省的各项生产建设任务。
    1958年，贵州省工、农业以及其他各项社会主义建设事业取得了全面大跃进的辉煌成就。工农业总产值直线上升，达到了三十七亿五千余万元。增长的总额等于第一个五年计划期间增长总和的一倍半。粮食去年全省实际收获量达到一百五十亿斤，增产的绝对数相当于1949年到1957年八年来增产数的总和。工业方面，去年以前一斤钢也不产的贵州省，在大跃进的1958年里生产了洋钢一万吨（连土钢共八万四千吨），洋铁四万吨（连土铁共六十万吨），今年比去年有了更大的跃进。过去不能生产的五十五立米以下的小高炉成套设备、全齿轮车床、一百八十瓩的电动机等等一百多种新产品，现在都能自己制造了。交通运输有了巨大的发展，正改变着贵州山区交通落后的面貌。其他各项工作也有很大的发展。
    代表们在这些辉煌成就的鼓舞下，感到无限兴奋。他们在小组讨论或在大会发言时，还用大量具体生动的事实，痛斥了国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子对大跃进、人民公社和大炼钢铁的污蔑。代表们一致指出，像贵州这样一个少铁无钢的省份，如果不发动群众大炼钢铁，既不可能在去年结束无钢的历史，也不可能在今年国庆节前夕提前完成全省全年洋钢生产计划。贵阳矿山机器厂的代表说，由于自己能炼钢，从而摆脱了过去那种钢铸件依靠上海、昆明等地供应的被动局面。代表们，特别是来自少数民族山区的代表们，在发言中一致强调指出，如果没有人民公社，要想战胜今年空前严重的自然灾害，使粮食作物在去年大丰收的基础上保产或增产，完全是不可能的。全国人民代表王耀伦（苗族）说，过去素称“水冷草枯、地瘠民贫”的剑河县，今年竟夺得全县水稻大面积高额丰产，大大提前和超额实现了农业发展纲要的指标。高寒山区能够这样大跃进，如果没有人民公社的强大力量是不可能实现的。
    在总结成绩，回顾过去的基础上，代表们对建设祖国、建设贵州更加充满了信心。大会通过决议，一致表示要坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会和中共贵州省委一届十次全会的决议，带动全省各族人民进一步开展增产节约运动，为全面地完成和超额完成今年的各项跃进计划而奋斗。
