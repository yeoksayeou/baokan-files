    Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 24th: TASS reported from New York on the 24th that the Permanent Mission of the Hungarian People's Republic to the United Nations issued a statement by the Hungarian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mod, condemning the United States Department of State and the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, for issuing statements viciously slandering the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union on the third anniversary of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion.

    The statement emphatically pointed out that the attempt to revive the so-called "Hungarian question" in the United Nations "is part of a series of heinous activities planned by American cold war conspirators, who are attempting, on the one hand, to undermine the constructive impact of the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower; on the other hand, to poison the already improved atmosphere at this United Nations General Assembly with new vicious attacks," wasting people's time and energy, and preventing them from paying attention to the real tasks facing the United Nations, especially the issue of disarmament. The statement concluded by saying, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic protests all attempts at interference and all cold war conspiracies.

    严斥美国诽谤匈苏两国
    据新华社24日讯　塔斯社纽约24日讯：匈牙利人民共和国常驻联合国代表处发表了匈牙利常驻联合国代表莫德的声明，谴责美国国务院和美国常驻联合国代表洛奇就匈牙利反革命叛乱三周年而发表恶毒地污蔑匈牙利人民共和国和苏联的声明。
    声明着重指出，企图在联合国复活所谓“匈牙利问题”的作法“是美国冷战阴谋家策划的一系列万恶活动的一部分，他们企图一方面破坏赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的会晤所产生的建设性的影响；另一方面利用新的恶毒攻击来毒化在这次联合国大会上已经好转的气氛”，浪费人们的时间和精力，使他们不去注意联合国所面临的真正任务，特别是裁军问题。声明最后说，匈牙利人民共和国政府根据联合国宪章的条款，抗议一切干涉的企图和一切冷战的阴谋。
