Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 20th: Sun Yinhan and Sun Yinrong, a brother and sister, were both elected as representatives to attend the National "Gathering of Heroes" the day before yesterday. The brother is an advanced producer on the industrial front—a doctor in the medical office of the Tianjin Alcohol Factory; the sister is a model worker on the commercial front—a salesperson at the Heping Road Store of the Tianjin Department Store.

The good news that the siblings were elected as representatives to the "Gathering of Heroes" spread to their home, and family members, neighbors, and friends all came to congratulate them on the honor bestowed upon them by the Party. Unable to hide her excitement, Sun Yinhan's wife also expressed her desire to learn from her brother and sister-in-law and strive to be a model of thrift and diligence. Even Sun Yinhan's mother-in-law rushed over upon hearing the news. This eighty-one-year-old woman, who rarely goes out, shouted the good news as soon as she entered the door. Sun Yinhan's children repeatedly told their father to send their regards to Chairman Mao. This request quickly became a collective demand from the whole family.

"Strive to go to Beijing, strive to see our beloved leader Chairman Mao" had long become the common aspiration of the siblings. Several months ago, one day, Sun Yinrong expressed in a radio broadcast that she would further improve her work and strive to go to Beijing to participate in the "Gathering of Heroes." In the evening, Sun Yinrong said to Sun Yinhan, "Let's have a competition, do you have confidence?" How could the older brother show weakness! He immediately said, "I have confidence, I must catch up with you and go to Beijing too." The sister said, "I want to make every customer satisfied." The brother contended, "I will treat workers, and I will cure every one of them."

From then on, the siblings competed with each other. Sun Yinhan kept thinking: Although his sister had been a labor model for several years and her achievements were more outstanding than his, as long as he relied on the Party and relied on the masses, he would definitely be able to catch up. He relied on the Party and other medical personnel in the factory, resolutely implemented the medical policy of "prevention first" in his work, and continuously used real people, real events, pictures, and other forms to strengthen health knowledge education for workers, workers' families, and canteen cooks. He also seized every available opportunity to understand production and living conditions in the factory premises and workers' dormitories, analyze the causes of illness and possible disease-causing factors, and proactively propose preventive measures. At the same time, he actively adopted comprehensive treatment methods, eliminating the phenomenon of workers taking long-term sick leave. Due to the proactive implementation of preventive measures, this factory had not experienced a gastroenteritis epidemic for 6 years, and no influenza or other collective infectious diseases for three years. For the health of the employees, he also compiled ancestral secret recipes and studied acupuncture.

Sun Yinrong also actively developed in the direction of becoming a versatile worker. She often squeezed out time to become familiar with the specifications and quality of various commodities, and also practiced various operations such as judging sizes by looking at people. In order to satisfy customers, she not only sold clothing, but also painstakingly studied sewing techniques and learned to design styles, transforming "fixed sizes" of clothing into "flexible specifications" that adapt to different customer body types. Her enthusiastic, sincere, and meticulous service attitude was frequently praised by customers.

Competing with each other, the siblings finally made outstanding achievements on different fronts.

Now, the siblings both have new concerns: how to further improve their work in the future to repay the honor given to them by the Party?

### 兄妹同赴“群英会”

    兄妹同赴“群英会”
    据新华社天津20日电　孙荫韩、孙荫荣兄妹俩，前天双双当选为出席全国“群英会”的代表。哥哥是工业战线上的先进生产者——天津酒精厂医务室医师；妹妹是商业战线上的模范——天津市百货公司和平路商店售货员。
    兄妹俩当选“群英会”代表的喜讯传到家里，全家老少、左邻右舍和亲友们，都来祝贺党给他们的荣誉。难以掩饰自己兴奋心情的孙荫韩的妻子，也表示要向哥妹俩学习，争取做个勤俭持家的模范。就连孙荫韩岳母也闻讯赶来了。这位平日很少出门的八十一岁老太太，一进门就喊着报喜。孙荫韩的孩子再三嘱咐爸爸，替自己向毛主席问好。这个嘱咐，很快就成了全家集体的要求。
    “争取去北京，争取见到敬爱的领袖毛主席”，早就成为他们兄妹的共同愿望。几个月以前，有一天，孙荫荣在电台广播讲话表示要进一步做好工作，争取上北京参加“群英会”。晚间，孙荫荣就对孙荫韩说：“咱俩挑挑战吧，你有信心吗？”当哥哥的哪能示弱！他马上表示：“有信心，我一定要赶上你，也要去北京。”妹妹说：“我要让个个顾客都满意。”哥哥争着说：“我给工人治病，要治一个好一个。”
    从此以后，兄妹俩比上了。孙荫韩一直这样琢磨着：虽然妹妹是好几年的劳动模范，成绩比自己突出，可是自己只要依靠党、依靠群众，一定能追上。他依靠党和厂里其他医务人员，在工作中坚决贯彻预防为主的医疗方针，不断用真人真事、图片等多种形式，向工人、工人家属、食堂炊事员等加强卫生常识教育。他还抓紧一切可以利用的时间，到工厂场地、工人宿舍了解生产和生活情况，分析发病原因和可能发病的因素，主动提出预防措施。同时，积极采取综合性治疗的办法，消灭了工人患病长期休养的现象。由于主动采取预防措施，这个工厂6年未发生过肠胃炎流行病，三年没发生流行性感冒和其它集体传染病。为了职工们的健康，他还整理了祖传秘方，学习针灸。
    孙荫荣也积极往多面手方向发展。她经常挤出时间，熟悉各种商品的规格和质量，还练习看人拿衣等各样操作。为了让顾客满意，她不光是卖服装，还苦心学习缝纫技术，学习设计式样，使服装的“死尺寸”变为适应顾客不同体型的“活规格”。她的热情、诚恳、深切入微的服务态度，经常受到顾客赞许。
    你追我赶，兄妹俩终于在不同的战线上，都作出了出色的成绩。
    现在，他们兄妹又都有了新的心事：今后怎样进一步做好自己的工作，报答党给的荣誉呢？
