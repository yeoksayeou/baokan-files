Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi delivered an important speech today at an enlarged meeting of the Tenth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regarding the recent proposal by the Soviet government on complete and thorough disarmament. He said, "This new Soviet proposal is of extremely great significance for promoting universal disarmament among all countries and consolidating the cause of lasting world peace. All peace-loving countries and people warmly welcome and support the new Soviet proposal on disarmament."

In his speech, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi condemned the American war-mongering clique for continuing the Cold War and expanding armaments, continuing to establish military bases around the world, resolutely reviving West German militarist forces, actively arming Japan, occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, instigating the civil war in Laos, and maliciously distorting and attacking the new Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. He pointed out that the new Soviet proposal on disarmament fully conforms to the fundamental interests and urgent desires of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. If the US government truly has the sincerity for disarmament and eliminating the "Cold War," it should accept the Soviet government's proposal and take active steps in disarmament with practical actions.

The full text of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi's speech is as follows: "The Soviet government issued a declaration and proposal on complete and thorough disarmament on September 18 this year and submitted it to the United Nations for discussion. This new Soviet proposal is of extremely great significance for promoting universal disarmament among all countries and consolidating the cause of lasting world peace. All peace-loving countries and people warmly welcome and support the new Soviet proposal on disarmament.

The Soviet government has consistently made significant efforts to achieve universal disarmament. Long before the Second World War, the Soviet government proposed extensive and thorough disarmament. After the war, the Soviet government repeatedly put forward a series of proposals on disarmament. On May 10, 1955, the Soviet government proposed that all countries should implement universal disarmament in two stages and ban atomic weapons to eliminate the threat of a new war. In July of the same year, the Soviet government reiterated this proposal at the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference. On November 17, 1956, the Soviet government issued another statement on disarmament and easing international tensions. The Soviet government has not only repeatedly put forward practical and feasible disarmament plans, but also repeatedly demonstrated the Soviet government's sincere desire to achieve disarmament through practical actions. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has implemented the extensive demobilization of armed forces, abolished all military bases in foreign countries, reduced its armed forces by more than two million personnel, and greatly reduced military expenditures. In 1958, the Soviet government unilaterally suspended atomic weapons and nuclear weapons testing.

This time, the Soviet government proposed a complete and thorough disarmament proposal to be carried out in three stages within four years. According to this proposal, the first stage is to: reduce the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and China to 1.7 million each under corresponding supervision, and the armed forces of Britain and France to 650,000 each. The number of armed forces reductions for other countries will be negotiated separately. At the same time, reduce armaments and military technical equipment; the second stage is to: complete the task of eliminating the remaining armed forces of all countries, abolish all military bases on foreign territories, and disband the withdrawn troops and military personnel; the third stage is to: destroy nuclear weapons, rocket weapons, air force military equipment, all chemical weapons and bacteriological weapons, and prohibit the production, possession, and storage of these weapons, prohibit all scientific research for military purposes, abolish military organs and organizations, stop any form of military funding, etc. In order to supervise the implementation of comprehensive and thorough disarmament measures, the Soviet government also proposed the establishment of an international supervisory agency. At the same time, the Soviet government also took into account that if Western countries are currently unwilling to carry out complete and thorough disarmament, the Soviet government is willing to reach agreements with Western countries on partial measures related to disarmament and strengthening security, such as establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, withdrawing all foreign troops from the territories of European countries and abolishing foreign military bases, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression, and signing an agreement on preventing a sudden attack by one country on another. This proposal was put forward by the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to launch artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets, the first to launch automatic interplanetary stations, possessing world-class science and technology and strong industrial power. This fully demonstrates the Soviet government's sincere desire and firm determination to achieve universal disarmament and maintain world peace.

However, the imperialist and aggressive groups, led by the United States, which are keen on the arms race, have consistently obstructed reaching an agreement on any disarmament proposal. Until now, the American war-mongering clique has not abandoned its policy of aggression and war, and continues to engage in the Cold War and expand armaments, continues to establish military bases around the world, resolutely revive the West German militarist forces, actively arm Japan, occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, and, in particular, recently instigated the Laotian government to undermine the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and provoke the civil war in Laos. Regarding the new Soviet disarmament proposal, the American war-mongering clique is still engaged in malicious distortion and attacks. If the US government truly has the sincerity for disarmament and eliminating the 'Cold War,' it should accept the Soviet government's proposal and take active steps in disarmament with practical actions.

The government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people have always loved peace and resolutely advocate that all countries in the world, especially major countries, should reduce armaments. We believe that the Soviet government's new proposal on disarmament fully conforms to the fundamental interests and urgent desires of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. Therefore, I request the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to discuss this proposal and adopt a corresponding resolution to firmly support the declaration and specific proposals on comprehensive and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government on September 18."

　　陈毅副总理兼外长在人大常委会上作重要发言
    苏联裁军建议符合世界人民利益
    谴责美国好战集团仍然进行冷战和扩军备战等行为
    新华社14日讯　陈毅副总理兼外交部长今天在人大常委会第十次会议扩大会议上就苏联政府最近关于全面彻底裁军的建议作了重要发言。他说：“苏联这个新建议对于推动各国普遍裁军和巩固世界持久和平的事业具有极为重大的意义。一切爱好和平的国家和人民都热烈欢迎和支持苏联关于裁军的新建议。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长在发言中谴责了美国好战集团仍然进行冷战和扩军备战，继续在全世界建立军事基地，坚决复活西德军国主义势力，积极武装日本，霸占我国领土台湾，挑起老挝内战，并且对苏联全面彻底裁军的新建议进行恶意歪曲和攻击等行为。他指出，苏联关于裁军的新建议完全符合中国人民和世界各国人民的根本利益和迫切愿望，如果美国政府真正具有裁军和消除“冷战”的诚意，就应该接受苏联政府的建议，以实际行动在裁军方面采取积极的步骤。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长的发言全文如下：“苏联政府于今年9月18日发表了关于全面彻底裁军的宣言和建议，并提交联合国讨论。苏联这个新建议对于推动各国普遍裁军和巩固世界持久和平的事业具有极为重大的意义。一切爱好和平的国家和人民都热烈欢迎和支持苏联关于裁军的新建议。
    苏联政府一贯为实现普遍裁军进行着重大的努力。远在第二次世界大战之前，苏联政府就曾提出广泛的彻底裁军建议。战后，苏联政府又多次就裁军问题提出了一系列的建议。1955年5月10日苏联政府就曾建议各国分两阶段实现普遍裁军、禁止原子武器以便消除新战争的威胁。同年7月，苏联政府在日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议上重申了这一建议。1956年11月17日苏联政府又发表了关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的声明。苏联政府不仅多次提出了切实可行的裁军方案，而且一再以实际行动证明苏联政府对实现裁军的真诚愿望。第二次世界大战结束以来，苏联实行了武装部队的广泛复员，撤消了在外国的一切军事基地，裁减了武装部队两百多万人员，并且大大削减了军费。1958年苏联政府并曾一度单方面停止原子武器和核武器的试验。
    这次苏联政府又提出在四年内分三阶段进行全面的和彻底的裁军建议。根据这个建议，在第一阶段实现：在相应的监督下把苏、美、中武装部队各裁减到一百七十万人，英、法各裁减到六十五万人，其他国家的武装部队裁减数另行商定，同时减少军备和军事技术装备；在第二阶段实现：完成取消各国留下的武装部队的工作，撤消所有在外国领土上的军事基地，撤回的军队和军事人员予以解散；在第三阶段实现：销毁核武器、火箭武器、空军军用器材、一切化学武器和细菌武器，并禁止这些武器的生产、拥有和储存，禁止用于军事目的的一切科学研究，撤消军事机关和组织，停止任何形式的军事拨款等等。为了监督实现全面的和彻底的裁军措施，苏联政府还建议成立国际监督机构。同时，苏联政府还考虑到，如果西方国家目前不愿意进行全面、彻底的裁军，苏联政府愿同西方国家就裁军和加强安全有关的局部措施，如在中欧建立无原子武器区、从欧洲国家领土上撤出一切外国军队并取消外国军事基地、北大西洋公约组织成员国同华沙条约缔约国缔结互不侵犯条约、签订关于防止一国对另一国突然袭击协定等问题达成协议。这个建议由世界上第一个发射人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭、第一个发射自动行星际站、拥有世界上头等的科学技术和强大的工业力量的苏联提出，这就充分表明了苏联政府对实现普遍裁军和维护世界和平的真诚愿望和坚定决心。
    但是，热衷于军备竞赛的、以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团一贯阻挠就任何裁军建议达成协议。直到现在，美国好战集团还没有放弃侵略政策和战争政策，仍然进行冷战和扩军备战，继续在全世界建立军事基地，坚决复活西德军国主义势力，积极武装日本，霸占我国领土台湾，特别是最近又策动老挝政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，挑起老挝内战。对于苏联裁军新建议，美国好战集团仍在进行恶意的歪曲和攻击。如果美国政府真正具有裁军和消除‘冷战’的诚意，就应该接受苏联政府的建议，以实际行动在裁军方面采取积极的步骤。
    中华人民共和国政府和中国人民一贯热爱和平，并且坚决主张世界各国特别是大国应该裁减军备。我们认为，苏联政府关于裁军问题的新建议，完全符合中国人民和世界各国人民的根本利益和迫切愿望。因此，我提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会讨论这一建议并且通过相应的决议，坚决支持苏联政府9月18日提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的宣言和具体建议。”
