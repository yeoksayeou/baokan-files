Carefully Harvest and Skillfully Pick for a Bumper Cotton Harvest

    Walking into the cotton fields of Cheng’an People's Commune in Cixian County, Hebei Province, you will not only see cotton plants laden with bolls, bursting open vigorously, and displaying good color, but also a method of picking cotton that is very different from previous years. The people picking cotton are arranged in an inverted "three" formation, which is the "three-two-one" cotton picking method; the formation resembling the character "two" is the "double-pocket double-pass" cotton picking method; and the row arranged in a "one" formation is the "one-bag three-pocket" cotton picking method. The teams are neatly organized and orderly, and many girls in various colorful clothes embellish the fields with vibrant colors.

    Look, those using the "one-bag three-pocket" method of picking cotton are dozens or even hundreds of people lined up in a team, moving forward in unison. Each of them has two small pockets attached to a large bag. With their keen eyesight and nimble hands, they pass through the field once, separating the cotton bolls on the plants into three grades—good, medium, and inferior—and picking and loading them into the three pockets respectively.

    The "double-pocket double-pass" cotton picking method involves each person having one small pocket attached to their large bag. They are arranged in two rows, front and back. The front row picks the good and medium cotton; the back row picks the inferior and lowest grade cotton. After only one pass, the good and inferior cotton are clearly separated.

    The "three-two-one" cotton picking method is similar to the past, with each person having one pocket. Six people form a group. The three people in the front row each take two rows, picking the best cotton; the two people in the middle row each take three rows, picking the medium-grade cotton; and the last person is responsible for six rows, picking up the clean boll cotton and fallen cotton. After one pass, the field is clean.

    These new methods of picking cotton were summarized by the Cheng’an Commune Party Committee from the cotton picking experience of the masses. Last year, with the realization of people's communes, earth-shaking new changes took place in the rural areas of the country, and people's mental outlook was also renewed. It was at this time that Wang Meiling, the women's team leader of Hechuan Village, successfully experimented with the "one-bag three-pocket" cotton picking method. One day in late autumn and early winter last year, when Wang Meiling was picking cotton, she thought that mixing impurities with good cotton would affect the quality of the cotton. She then sorted the cotton she had already picked, and as a result, she picked out five jin of inferior cotton and three liang of dry leaves from one hundred jin of cotton. The cotton she selected was sent to the state cotton collection station, and everyone said it was of good grade and clean. The comrades at the purchasing station also said, "If we could collect such good cotton, the state would save a lot of manpower to specially sort it." Wang Meiling listened to this sentence and was determined to create a good cotton picking method. Finally, she found the answer from the principle that multiple pockets could hold different things. She thought: If everyone made two small pockets on their cotton picking bag and separated the various cotton bolls into different pockets, wouldn't that be a good idea? So, in the women's production team she led, several experiments were conducted, and the results were very good. Piles of cotton separated by grade were pleasing to everyone who saw them. This cotton picking method is especially suitable when there are withered branches and leaves in the later stage of cotton growth.

    When the Commune Party Committee proposed this year to comprehensively do a good job in "four separations" (separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, separate selling), the members of the commune with a high sense of collectivism, in their hard work, came up with many new innovations. Zhang Xiurong and Gao Ruiqin, young women from Daodongbao of this commune, and four others, successfully experimented with the "three-two-one" cotton picking method when picking the first flush of cotton in early September. According to their experience, the advantages of using this method are: it is suitable for low cotton plants and the early stage of cotton fields, it has high efficiency, and one can focus on picking the grade of cotton one wants to pick; it makes up for the shortcomings of the "one-bag three-pocket" and "double-pocket double-pass" cotton picking methods, which are prone to misplacement of cotton. After the promotion of this method, it played a decisive role in improving the quality of cotton, changing the previous situation where cotton production could not be harvested well and seriously affected the quality of cotton.

    As of October 15th, this commune has sold 24,070,000 jin of cotton to the state. The picking speed has increased by more than 60% compared to the same period last year; in terms of quality, it has generally improved by one grade compared to last year, with second and third grade cotton accounting for 86% of the total, and fourth grade cotton basically eliminated. Because of the good grade and high selling price of cotton, the commune has increased its income by one million yuan this year, with an average increase of forty yuan per member. This is the benefit of improving cotton picking methods.

    精收巧摘丰产棉
    走到河北磁县成安公社的棉田，你除了看到棉花伏桃多、开的猛、色泽好以外，还会看到与往年大不相同的采摘棉花的方法。采摘棉花的人们，有摆成倒“三”字队形的，这是“三二一”的摘棉法；队形摆得像“二”字的，是“双兜双遍”摘棉法；那排成“一”字形的，又是“一包三兜”的摘棉法。队伍整整齐齐有条不紊，许多身着各种花衣的姑娘们，把田野点缀得五颜六色。
    看，用“一包三兜”法摘棉花的，是几十人甚至百多人摆成一队，齐头并进。她们每人在一个大包上都做着两个小兜，凭着敏锐的眼力和灵巧的双手，一遍过去，就把棉棵上的棉花，分成好、中、次三个品级，分别采摘并装进三个兜里。
    “双兜双遍”摘棉法，每个人的大包上做着一个小兜，分前后两排，前排的摘好的和中等棉；后排的摘次棉和末等棉。只要摘过一遍，好花次花分得一清二楚。
    “三二一”的摘棉法，和过去采棉一样，每人就是一个兜，六个人一组，前排三人每人两垅，采摘最好的棉花；中排二人每人三个垅，采摘中等的棉花；最后一人负责六个垅，拣摘净瓣棉和落地棉；一遍过去地里干干净净。
    这些采摘棉花的新方法，是成安公社党委从群众摘棉经验中总结出来的。去年实现人民公社化，全国农村发生了惊天动地的新变化，人们的精神面貌也为之一新。就在这个时候，河町村妇女队长王美玲试验成功了“一包三兜”摘棉法。去年秋末冬初的一天，王美玲在摘棉花的时候，想到杂质花和好花混在一起，会影响棉花的质量，自己便把已摘的棉加以挑检，结果从一百斤棉花里边拣出五斤次花，还有三两干花叶。她选的棉花送到国家收棉站，人人都说品级好，干净。收购站的同志还说：“要完全收这样好棉，就省得国家花大量人力再专门去挑拣了。”王美玲听了这句，便一心想创造一种好的摘棉法，终于从口袋多可以分别装东西这个道理上找到了答案。她想：要是每个人在摘棉包上做两个小兜，把采摘的各种棉花分开装到各个兜里，这不是很好的办法吗？于是在她领导的妇女生产队几次试验，效果很好，分出了等级的一堆堆的棉花，谁看见谁喜欢。这种采棉办法在棉花后期有了枯枝枯叶的时候特别适用。
    当今年公社党委提出要全面做好“四分”（分摘、分晒、分存、分售），首先要把棉花采摘工作作好的时候，有着高度集体主义思想的社员群众在辛勤劳动中又有了不少新创造。这个公社道东堡青年姑娘张秀荣、高瑞芹等六人，9月初摘头喷花的时候，试验成功了“三二一”的摘棉法。运用这个方法的好处，按她们的体会是：适宜于棉棵低、棉田前期使用，工效高，可以专心摘自己要摘的那种品级棉花；弥补了“一包三兜”和“双兜双遍”摘棉法容易装错兜的缺点。这个方法推广以后，对提高棉花质量起着决定作用，它改变了以往棉花丰产不能丰收，严重影响棉花质量的状况。
    这个公社截至10月15日已卖给国家二千四百零七万斤棉花。在采摘速度上，比去年同期提高了60％以上；在质量上，比去年普遍提高了一级，其中二、三级棉占总数的86％，基本消灭了四级棉。由于棉花品级好、售价高，公社今年增加了一百万元的收入，平均每个社员增加四十元，这是改进摘棉方法带来的好处。
