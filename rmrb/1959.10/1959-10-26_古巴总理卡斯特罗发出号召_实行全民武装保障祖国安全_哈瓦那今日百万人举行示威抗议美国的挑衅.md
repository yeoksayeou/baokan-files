Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 23rd: In a television address that concluded in the early hours of today, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro stated that our response to the despicable air raids on Cuba by Batista elements flying from American bases will be: to implement military training for workers, farmers, students, professionals, and even women, mobilizing the entire nation of Cuba to safeguard the country’s security.

Castro announced: Measures have been taken to implement military training for workers and farmers through the system of trade unions and agricultural development zones.

Castro said that we should also rely on the support of people around the world. He announced that a grand rally with one million participants will be held next Monday (the 26th), and from that gathering, we will voice our protest against the air raids on Cuba and demand international support.

Castro said that the air raid on Havana was the third such attack on Cuba in fifteen days. On October 9th, an aircraft bombed the Niágara sugar mill, followed by a bombing of the Alegre Point sugar mill. The air raid on Havana resulted in forty-seven casualties among the residents.

Castro asked: How can the American authorities claim to be unaware of aircraft flying in and out of their territory?

Fidel Castro demanded that the United States take measures to stop similar anti-Cuban incidents. He exposed the American authorities' connivance with the Batista elements, saying that Batista's war criminals were not only not handed over to the Cuban authorities but also enjoyed every convenience for wrongdoing in the United States. (Former Cuban Air Force Commander and traitor) Díaz Lanz became a distinguished guest of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security.

Referring to the counter-revolutionary plot of Matos uncovered in Camagüey, Castro pointed out that there was a close relationship between Matos and Díaz Lanz. He said: "I can assert that the Camagüey incident is related to the bombing of Havana. I have evidence."

Castro condemned the conspiracy to attack Cuba by using the pretext that "the Cuban revolutionary government is a communist government." He said: After seeing that such remarks are being used against us, I no longer believe the past and present anti-communist lies. Castro said: "Well, let them say whatever they want. It doesn't matter to me. Let history be the judge. We believe that we are doing well and will continue to do so."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 24th: Preparations are actively underway for the million-person mass rally scheduled to be held in the capital, Havana, on the 26th. This rally is being convened to mobilize the people to defend the revolution and protest against the slaughter of peaceful residents by aircraft coming from the United States.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation has mobilized workers nationwide to stop work at noon on the 26th to participate in this grand rally. The Cuban People's Socialist Party and the "July 26th Movement" newspaper "Revolución" have both published statements and articles calling on people from all walks of life in Cuba to actively participate in this mass rally.

To be able to arrive in the capital on time to participate in the demonstration, workers in Pinar del Río, Las Villas, and Matanzas have decided to stop work for one day on the 26th. The Provisional Leadership of the Cuban Workers' Confederation accepted the initiative of several trade union organizations and decided today that all workers will donate one day's wages to the government to be used for a fund to purchase aircraft and other essential defense weapons to defend national security.

Domestic and foreign enemies continue to carry out sabotage activities. According to "Hoy," another attack by foreign aircraft occurred in Las Villas province on the evening of the 23rd. A twin-engine aircraft from the United States strafed a passenger train on the Yaguajay-Caibarién railway line in Guani. The aircraft flew away after being fired upon by the train guards. On the same evening, a light aircraft scattered seditious pamphlets in several areas of Havana.

Faced with increasingly rampant counter-revolutionary subversive conspiracies from home and abroad, the Cuban government has strengthened suppression and defense measures. Police authorities announced today that approximately forty thugs were arrested in the suburbs of Havana. They were arrested today while preparing to carry out terrorist assassination activities. Revolutionary armed forces in Camagüey today foiled a plot by a group of rioters to seize a radio station.

    古巴总理卡斯特罗发出号召
    实行全民武装保障祖国安全
    哈瓦那今日百万人举行示威抗议美国的挑衅
    新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗在今天凌晨结束的电视讲话中说，我们对巴蒂斯塔分子从美国基地起飞对古巴进行卑鄙的空袭的回答将是：对工人、农民、学生、自由职业者、甚至妇女实行军事训练，动员古巴全国的力量来保障祖国的安全。
    卡斯特罗宣布：已经采取措施按工会和农业开发区的系统对工人和农民实施军事训练。
    卡斯特罗说，我们也应该依靠世界各国人民的支援。他宣布说：已经决定在下星期一（26日）举行有一百万人参加的盛大集会，我们将从大会上发出对空袭古巴的抗议和要求国际支援的声音。
    卡斯特罗说，这次对哈瓦那的空袭已经是十五天来古巴遭到的第三次空袭。10月9日，一架飞机轰炸了尼亚加拉糖厂，以后一次是在阿莱格雷角糖厂投炸弹。而这次对哈瓦那的空袭使居民伤亡四十七人。
    卡斯特罗问道：怎么能解释美国当局不了解从它的领土飞进飞出的飞机呢？
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗要求美国采取措施制止类似的反古巴事件。他揭露美国当局纵容巴蒂斯塔分子，他说，巴蒂斯塔的战犯非但没有被交给古巴当局，反而在美国享受着一切为非作歹的便利条件。（古巴叛徒前空军司令）迪亚斯·兰斯成为美国参议院国内安全小组委员会的贵宾。
    卡斯特罗在谈到在卡马圭破获的马托斯反革命阴谋时指出，马托斯同迪亚斯·兰斯之间有密切关系。他说：“我可以断定，卡马圭事件同轰炸哈瓦那一事有关。我有证据。”
    卡斯特罗谴责那种以“古巴革命政府是共产党政府”为借口攻击古巴的阴谋。他说：在看到这类言论是在反对我们之后，我就不相信过去和现在的反共谎言了。卡斯特罗说：“好了，他们爱说什么就说什么好了，这对我无所谓。让历史来给我们做判断吧。我们认为，我们做得很好，并且要继续做下去。”
    据新华社哈瓦那24日电　定于26日在首都哈瓦那举行的一百万人的群众大会的筹备工作正在积极进行。召开这次大会是为了动员人民保卫革命和抗议来自美国的飞机对和平居民的屠杀。
    古巴工人联合会已经动员全国工人在26日中午停止工作，以便参加这次盛大的集会。古巴人民社会党和“7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”都发表了声明和文章，号召古巴各阶层人民积极参加这次群众集会。
    为了能按时到达首都参加示威大会，比那尔德里奥、拉斯维利亚斯和马坦萨斯的工人已经决定在26日停止工作一天。古巴工人联合会临时领导机构接受几个工会组织的倡议，今天决定全体工人向政府捐献一天的工资，用来购买飞机和其他国防必需武器的基金，以保卫祖国安全。
    国内外敌人继续在进行破坏活动。据“今日报”报道，23日晚上在拉斯维利亚斯省又发生了外来飞机的袭击事件。一架从美国来的双引擎飞机在瓜尼扫射了亚瓜哈伊—凯巴利安铁路线的一列客车。这架飞机在遭到列车卫队的射击后飞走了。同一天晚上有一架轻型飞机在哈瓦那的几个地区散发煽动叛乱的小册子。
    面对着来自国内外的日益猖獗的反革命颠覆阴谋，古巴政府加强了镇压和防卫措施。警察当局今天宣布：在哈瓦那郊区逮捕了约四十名暴徒。他们是在今天准备进行恐怖暗杀活动时被捕的。卡马圭革命武装部队今天粉碎了一批暴乱分子企图占领一家广播电台的计划。
