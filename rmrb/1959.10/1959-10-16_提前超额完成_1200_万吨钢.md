　　Surpassing the Target by 12 Million Tons of Steel Ahead of Schedule
    The current economic situation in our country is very good, and the situation on the steel front is also like this. It is possible that this year's entire industrial production plan will be completed ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule; the steel production plan may also be completed ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. Today, this newspaper publishes news such as the Anshan Iron and Steel workers' determination to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule, increasing the country's steel production by 250,000 tons and steel materials by 400,000 tons, and the early commissioning of the No. 1 blast furnace at Baotou Steel a year ahead of schedule. These are important signs of this excellent situation.
    This extremely good situation on the steel front is the result of the vigorous production increase and conservation campaign centered on high yield, high quality, and low cost, launched by the million steel workers in response to the Party Central Committee's call to "oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and practice increased production and conservation." Prior to this, although the situation on the steel front was also good, with each month's output showing a large increase compared to the same period last year, the rate of growth was relatively slow, and in June and July there was even a slight decrease in output. After the struggle against Right-leaning tendencies was launched, the situation of declining production quickly changed, and a situation of rapidly increasing output emerged that had never been seen before this year. In just two months, the daily output of steel increased by nearly 20,000 tons, the daily output of iron increased by more than 20,000 tons, and the daily output of steel materials increased by more than 10,000 tons. As of the end of September, the output of steel, iron, and steel materials produced this year has exceeded the total annual output of the great leap forward in 1958. At present, this excellent situation of steel production moving forward continues to develop. In the first half of October, the daily output of steel, iron, and steel materials continued to rise steadily, both in key steel enterprises and in small and medium-sized steel enterprises; in particular, the technical progress of small and medium-sized steel enterprises was even more significant.
    This excellent situation is a great victory for the heroic sons and daughters on the steel front, who are holding high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction, opposing Right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and enthusiastically carrying out the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. Why did steel production decline slightly in June and July? Was it due to objective reasons? There were some objective reasons, such as the necessary adjustments to production after the plan was adjusted; but mainly it was due to subjective reasons, that is, the slackening of efforts, especially the influence of Right-leaning thoughts. The sentiment of fearing difficulties and Right-leaning thoughts rose among some cadres, and the mass movement was weakened. Why has output soared since August? Was it due to objective reasons? No. August is hot, and for the high-temperature steel industry, it has always been a low-yield month. However, by opposing Right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching a high tide of mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, the low-yield month became a high-yield month, and since then it has risen step by step, moving forward. At present, the central task facing the million steel workers on the steel front is to continue to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and consolidate and deepen the already vigorously developing production increase and conservation movement, to ensure the completion of this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.
    In order to complete this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, the first thing to do is to continue to focus on pig iron production. Our country does not have much scrap steel, and steelmaking mainly uses pig iron, so the increase in steel production depends first on the increase in iron production. Although pig iron production has greatly increased in the past two months, the ironmaking sector still needs to continue its efforts to ensure that "there is as much iron as there is steel." To increase the output of pig iron, the most important thing at present is to try every means to save coking coal and reduce coke consumption, so as to produce more pig iron with relatively less coking coal. This is because the supply of coking coal is still not very abundant. Excessive coke consumption will not only limit the increase in the output of each furnace of pig iron, but also lead to a situation where coking coal is used up and cannot be replenished quickly, which will cause great difficulties for future pig iron production. Only by trying every means to save coking coal and reduce coke consumption can pig iron production be continuously improved. In addition, mining, transporting, and storing more various ironmaking raw materials are also an important prerequisite for ensuring the continued improvement of pig iron production; as for the significance of further promoting various effective advanced experiences, improving the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, and tapping production potential for increasing pig iron production, it goes without saying. What needs to be particularly emphasized in ironmaking production is to continue to focus on the production of small blast furnaces. In this year's pig iron production, small blast furnaces are responsible for half of the total output. The facts of the past few months, especially the past two months, have proved that small blast furnaces are fully capable of undertaking this heavy task. In August, the daily output of pig iron from small blast furnaces nationwide increased by 9.5% compared to July, the pass rate has increased by 4.5% compared to July, and the amount of coke required to produce one ton of pig iron has also decreased from 1.67 tons in July to 1.5 tons. The advanced Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Anhui provinces have achieved utilization coefficients of 1.053, 0.986, and 0.853 respectively, pass rates have increased to 91.56%, 96.6%, and 84.57% respectively, and the amount of coke required to produce one ton of pig iron has decreased to 1.189 tons, 1.032 tons, and 1.426 tons respectively. The cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces has also been proven to be gradually reduced to the level of large blast furnaces. All of this shows that small blast furnaces have great potential, and the so-called "small blast furnaces are not worth the loss" theory of Right-leaning opportunists is groundless. We must continue to focus on the production of small blast furnaces and let them play a greater role in the struggle to complete this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.
    After having more pig iron, there is a very important link to produce more steel, that is, transportation. Due to historical reasons, many steel enterprises in our country only produce steel but not iron; or the steelmaking capacity is greater than the ironmaking capacity. The pig iron used for steelmaking in these enterprises needs to be transferred from other places. At present, the national pig iron transfer task is nearly one million tons per month. This is a very huge task. In the past, it often happened that it was not that there was no iron, but it could not be transported, and the production potential of steelmaking enterprises could not be fully utilized, and good times were watched to go to waste. Although this situation has rarely occurred recently, pig iron transfer is still a very heavy task, and production departments and transportation departments must try every means to transfer the pig iron that should be transferred on time and in quantity. All provinces and autonomous regions must also launch a mass movement for short-distance transportation to concentrate the pig iron scattered in various places on the main lines of water and land transportation. Various steel enterprises need to specially transfer capable cadres to be responsible for doing a good job in internal transportation, vigorously strengthen loading and unloading work, especially unloading work. Only by speeding up unloading work and freeing up empty vehicles as soon as possible can limited vehicles undertake greater tasks.
    After having enough pig iron and transporting it out in time, whether it can be guaranteed to complete this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule depends on the efforts of the steelmaking enterprises themselves. In terms of steelmaking production, we already have strong equipment capacity, and we have summarized a more systematic experience in rapid steelmaking; as long as we earnestly promote these advanced experiences and give full play to the equipment capacity, it is entirely possible to complete this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. What needs to be particularly emphasized here is to focus on the production of converters. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, our country's converters have developed greatly. In this year's total steel output, converters are responsible for 32%. Most of these converters have just been put into production and have great potential. For example, in September, the utilization coefficient of converters (the steel output produced by each ton of converter per day and night) in the No. 1 workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant reached 36.34 tons; if the utilization coefficient of converters nationwide is increased to 15 to 20 tons, the daily output of converter steel can be increased by 50% to 100%. For example, the qualified rate of converter steel in key enterprises averaged 91% in July and August, while the qualified rate of converter steel in Tianjin steel plants reached 98.3% in the first half of August. If the qualified rate of converter steel in key steel enterprises nationwide can reach the level of Tianjin, the output of converter steel in these enterprises can be increased by another 7%. It is entirely possible for the production of converter steel to quickly catch up with the advanced level. This is not only because the material and technical conditions for the production of converter steel have been greatly improved and improved, but also because we have summarized a set of experiences in improving the production of converter steel, which is currently being promoted nationwide.
    Having steel also requires rolling out steel materials, and this year's steel materials production plan must also be completed ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. This is a key link in implementing the policy of "taking steel as the key" in the heavy industry sector, and it is also a link that has a significant impact on the continued great leap forward of the entire national economy. The policy of "taking steel as the key" in the heavy industry sector, on the one hand, means that grasping steel will promote the leap forward of coal, machinery, and other departments together; on the other hand, it also means that grasping steel can create conditions for the development of coal, machinery, and other departments, and drive these departments to leap forward together. This condition is nothing else but steel materials. With steel, but not rolled into steel materials, various machines cannot be made, and it is impossible to create a situation of "taking steel as the key and making an all-round leap forward." Over the years, the amount of steel materials has been an important basis when formulating national economic plans. Every 100 million yuan of machinery industry output value requires about 25,000 tons of steel materials. Therefore, how much the output value of the machinery industry can increase depends to a large extent on how much the output of steel materials can increase. Every 100 million yuan of basic construction workload requires about 14,000 tons of steel materials. Therefore, how large the scale of basic construction is depends to a large extent on how much the output of steel materials can increase. The importance and influence of steel materials production can be seen from this. Grasping steel materials production and completing this year's steel materials production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule is a decisive task on the steel front. Although steel rolling has always been a weak link in our country's steel industry, it should be seen that the possibility of completing this year's steel materials production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule also exists. This is because a large number of old steel rolling mills have been renovated this year, and a batch of new steel rolling mills will also be put into production. We have also summarized a set of advanced experiences of "feeding steel from multiple lines and rolling steel quickly." As long as we earnestly promote these advanced experiences, give full play to the capacity of the original steel rolling equipment, make the newly put into production steel rolling equipment produce normally quickly, and grasp the construction and installation projects of steel rolling mills that have not yet been put into production, and strengthen the dispatching of steel ingots and steel billets, steel materials production will definitely continue to increase. After overproducing 167,000 tons of steel materials in the third quarter, Anshan Iron and Steel's thirteen steel rolling mills put forward the resounding slogan of guaranteeing an overproduction of 400,000 tons of steel materials for the whole year and advocated friendship competitions to steel rolling mills across the country. This shows that steel rolling production also has great potential. In steel rolling production, in addition to completing this year's steel materials production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, we must also try our best to increase the variety, and currently we must especially strive to increase the production of light rails, steel plates, steel pipes, and wire rods.
    Completing this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule is of great significance. It will not only enable the steel industry sector to free up more time to do a good job in preparing for next year's production, especially the first quarter of next year, so that the steel production level in the first quarter of next year will not be lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year; but also create more favorable conditions for completing this year's entire industrial production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule and for the continued great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year.
    Steel fighters who have repeatedly made outstanding achievements! Hold the red flag of the general line of socialist construction even higher, continue to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, deepen the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, make persistent efforts, and advance victoriously!

　　提前超额完成1200万吨钢
    当前我国的经济形势非常良好，钢铁战线的形势也是这样。今年整个工业生产计划有可能提前十天到十五天完成；钢铁生产计划也有可能提前十天到十五天完成。今天本报发表的鞍钢职工决心提前完成今年生产计划，为国家增产二十五万吨钢和四十万吨钢材；包钢一号高炉提前一年投入生产等消息，就是这个大好形势的重要标志。
    钢铁战线上这个极为良好的形势，是钢铁战线上百万职工响应党中央“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召，轰轰烈烈地开展了以高产、优质、低成本为中心的增产节约运动的结果。在这以前，钢铁战线的形势虽然也是良好的，各个月的产量都比去年同期有很大的增长；但是增长的速度比较慢，6、7月份甚至还出现了产量略有下降的情形。反右倾的斗争开展以后，生产下降的情况迅速改变，出现了今年以来从来不曾有过的产量扶摇直上的局面。仅仅两个月的时间，钢的日产水平就提高了近两万吨，铁的日产水平提高了两万多吨，钢材的日产水平提高了一万多吨。截至9月底，今年已经生产的钢、铁和钢材的产量，都已超过特大跃进的1958年的全年产量。目前，钢铁生产这种一往直前的大好形势仍在继续发展。10月上半月，钢、铁、钢材的日产水平，无论在重点钢铁企业，或者在中小型钢铁企业，都继续稳步上升；特别是中小型钢铁企业在技术上的进步更为显著。
    这一派大好形势，是钢铁战线上的英雄儿女高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，反右倾、鼓干劲，热烈开展增产节约群众运动的伟大胜利。为什么6、7月间钢铁产量曾一度略有下降呢？是客观原因吗？客观原因有一些，这就是计划调整后生产上也需要作必要的调整；但是主要是主观原因，这就是松劲情绪，特别是右倾思想作怪。某些干部中的畏难情绪和右倾思想抬头了，群众运动削弱了。8月以来为什么产量扶摇直上呢？是客观原因吗？不是的。8月份天气炎热，对于高温作业的钢铁工业说来，一向是低产月。但是反了右倾，鼓足干劲，掀起了增产节约群众运动的高潮，低产月变成了高产月，并且从此步步高升，一往直前。目前，摆在钢铁战线百万职工面前的中心任务，就是要继续反右倾、鼓干劲，把已经蓬勃开展起来的增产节约运动巩固地和深入地发展下去，保证提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁生产计划。
    为了提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁生产计划，首先就要继续抓紧生铁生产。我国废钢不多，炼钢主要用生铁，因而钢的增产首先取决于铁的增产。这两个月来，生铁产量虽然有了极大的增长，但是要保证作到“炼多少钢就有多少铁”，仍需要炼铁部门继续努力。要增加生铁的产量，目前特别重要的是千方百计地节约焦煤，降低焦炭消耗，以比较少的焦煤炼出更多的生铁。这是因为目前焦煤的供应仍然不是很充裕的。焦炭消耗过多，不仅将使每一炉生铁产量的增长受到限制，而且会发生焦煤用光而不能迅速得到补充的情况，这就给日后的生铁生产造成很大的困难。只有千方百计地节约焦煤，降低焦炭消耗，才能使生铁生产持续不断地提高。此外，多采、多运和多储备各种炼铁原料，也是保证生铁生产继续提高的一个重要前提；至于进一步推广各种行之有效的先进经验，提高高炉的利用系数，挖掘生产潜力，对于增产生铁的意义，更是不用多说的。在炼铁生产方面需要特别着重提出的，是要继续抓紧小高炉生产。在今年的生铁生产中，小高炉担负着总产量的一半的任务。几个月来，特别是最近两个月来的事实证明，小高炉是完全可以担负起这个重任的。8月份全国小高炉生铁的日产水平比7月份提高了9.5％，合格率已经比7月份提高了4.5％，炼一吨生铁所需用的焦炭数量也从7月份的一点六七吨降低到一点五吨。先进的江苏、云南、安徽等省的小高炉利用系数已分别达到一点零五三、零点九八六和零点八五三，合格率分别提高到91.56％、96.6％和84.57％，炼一吨生铁所需用的焦炭数量则分别降低到一点一八九吨、一点零三二吨和一点四二六吨。小高炉生铁的成本也已被证明可以争取逐步降低到大高炉的水平。凡此种种，都说明小高炉大有可为，右倾机会主义分子所谓“小高炉得不偿失”论是毫无根据的。我们一定要继续抓紧小高炉生产，让它在提前十天到十五天完成今年钢铁生产计划的斗争中发挥更大的作用。
    有了更多的生铁之后，要炼出更多的钢来，还有一个十分重要的环节，就是调运。由于历史的原因，我国的许多钢铁企业只产钢、不产铁；或者炼钢的能力大于炼铁的能力。这些企业炼钢用的生铁需要外地调运。目前，全国的生铁调运任务每个月几近百万吨。这是一个十分巨大的任务。过去常常出现这样的情形：不是没有铁，只是运不到，炼钢企业的生产潜力不能充分发挥，眼睁睁地看着大好时光付诸东流。这种情况近来虽然很少发生，但是生铁调运仍然是一项很繁重的工作，生产部门和运输部门必须想尽一切办法把应该调运的生铁按时按量地调运出来。各个省和自治区也必须开展短途运输的群众运动，把分散在各地的生铁集中到水陆运输干线上来。各个钢铁企业需要特别抽调得力干部，负责作好厂内运输工作，大力加强装卸工作，特别是卸车工作。只有加快卸车工作，尽快地腾出空车来，才能使有限的车辆担负起更大的任务。
    有了足够的生铁，并且及时调运出来之后，能不能保证提前十天到十五天完成今年钢的生产计划，就看炼钢企业本身的努力了。在炼钢生产方面，我们已经有了强大的设备能力，而且已经总结出比较系统的快速炼钢的经验；只要认真推广这些先进经验，充分发挥设备能力，提前十天到十五天完成今年钢的生产计划是完全可能的。这里特别需要着重提出的是抓紧转炉的生产。去年大跃进以来，我国的转炉有了很大的发展。在今年钢的总产量中，转炉担负着32％的任务。这些转炉大部分是新投入生产的，潜力很大。例如，9月份上钢三厂一车间转炉利用系数（每吨位转炉一昼夜生产的钢产量）高达三十六点三四吨；如果把全国转炉的利用系数提高到十五吨到二十吨，就可以使转炉钢的日产水平提高50％到100％。又如转炉钢的合格率，7、8月份重点企业平均达到91％，而天津各钢厂转炉钢的合格率8月上半月达到98.3％，如果全国重点钢铁企业的转炉钢的合格率都能达到天津的水平，就可以使这些企业转炉钢的产量又提高7％。转炉钢的生产迅速赶上先进水平是完全可能的。这不仅是因为目前转炉钢的生产的物质技术条件已经有了很大的改进和提高，而且因为我们已经总结出一套提高转炉钢生产的经验，目前正在全国推广。
    有了钢还要轧出钢材，今年钢材的生产计划也必须提前十天到十五天完成。这是贯彻执行在重工业方面，“以钢为纲”的方针的关键环节，也是对于整个国民经济继续大跃进有重大影响的环节。在重工业方面“以钢为纲”的方针，一方面是意味着抓了钢铁，会推动煤炭、机械等部门一起跃进；另一方面也意味着抓了钢铁，能给煤炭、机械等部门的发展造成条件，带动这些部门一起跃进。这种条件不是别的，就是钢材。有了钢、没有轧成钢材，就制不成各种各样的机器，就不可能造成“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的局面。历年来在制订国民经济计划的时候，钢材的多少是一个重要的依据。每一亿元的机械工业产值约需钢材两万五千吨，因此，机械工业的产值增长多少，在很大程度上要看钢材的产量能增长多少。每一亿元的基本建设工作量约需钢材一万四千吨，因此，基本建设的规模摆多大，在很大程度上也要看钢材的产量能增长多少。钢材生产关系之大、影响之广，由此可见。抓紧钢材生产，提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢材生产计划，是钢铁战线上一项有决定意义的任务。在我国钢铁工业中，轧钢虽然一直是一个薄弱环节，但是应该看到，提前十天到十五天完成今年钢材生产计划的可能性也是存在的。这是因为今年以来已经有大批旧轧钢机经过了改造，并且还将有一批新的轧钢机投入生产，我们也已经总结出一套“多条喂钢、快速轧钢”的先进经验。只要我们认真推广这些先进经验，使原有轧钢设备的能力得到充分发挥，使新投入生产的轧钢设备迅速正常生产，并且抓紧还没有投入生产的轧钢机建设安装工程，加强钢锭、钢坯的调度工作，钢材生产一定能继续增长。鞍钢十三个轧钢厂在第三季度超额生产了十六万七千吨钢材之后，又提出保证全年超产四十万吨钢材的响亮口号，向全国轧钢厂倡议开展友谊竞赛。足见轧钢生产同样是大有可为的。在轧钢生产中，除了提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢材生产计划之外，还要尽力增加品种，目前特别要努力增产一批轻轨、钢板、钢管和线材。
    提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁生产计划，具有十分重大的意义。它不仅将使钢铁工业部门能够腾出更多的时间做好明年的、特别是明年第一季度的生产准备工作，使明年第一季度的钢铁生产水平不低于今年第四季度；而且将为提前十天到十五天完成今年整个工业生产计划和明年工业生产和农业生产的继续大跃进创造更为有利的条件。
    屡建奇功的钢铁战士们！更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的红旗，继续反对右倾，鼓足干劲，深入开展增产节约的群众运动，再接再厉，乘胜前进！
