Yao Xingen is currently the captain of the cofferdam team of the Fuchunjiang Hydropower Bureau. Since being transferred from the Shanghai Shipyard to the hydropower system in October 1951, he has worked at the Huangtankou, Jiangxi Shangyou, Xin'anjiang, and Fuchunjiang hydropower stations. In June of this year, he went to the Guangxi Xijin Hydropower Station to help resolve a cofferdam damage accident. Wherever he went, he excellently completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party, and thus won the honorary titles of Industrial Labor Model of the First Five-Year Plan of Zhejiang Province, and Activist for Socialist Construction of the Province in 1958.

	The First Test
In the winter of 1952, the Huangtankou Hydropower Station project was under intense construction. At night, the cold wind swept across the river, and the river water was blown into waves. Yao Xingen stood on the beach, his thick eyebrows furrowed, thinking about how to move those huge rocks in the rolling river. From the day he discovered these large rocks three days ago until now, his heart had never left them for a moment. Now, the leadership has sent him here to be responsible for underwater foundation clearing work. If these large rocks are not removed, the cofferdam cannot be closed before the flood season, and the entire project will be forced to stop. Although Lao Yao had been mixing in rivers for one or two decades and knew everything about underwater matters, these large rocks stumped him. He paced back and forth on the riverbank, his thoughts rolling like the raging torrent in front of him. "Gosh! How great it would be if a crane could be used to lift these big rocks away, but where can we find a crane that can lift one hundred and twenty tons?" he asked himself.

Late at night, Yao Xingen slowly walked back to his dormitory, fell onto the bed, and couldn't sleep for a long time...

The next morning, the sound of blasting rocks awoke him. This blasting sound inspired him. He thought: mountain rocks can be blasted, can underwater rocks be blasted too? He sat up, without even eating breakfast, and ran to tell the leaders of the engineering committee. After studying the matter, the leaders agreed to Yao Xingen's experiment, but who should go down to drill holes? Divers couldn't drill, and pneumatic drill operators couldn't dive.

"Let's go! Let's learn to drill first," Yao Xingen said decisively.

On the hillside, Yao Xingen practiced continuously for more than ten hours, and large blisters rose in the palms of his hands. Finally, he learned the basic operations of drilling. Without resting, he put on his diving suit, held the pneumatic drill, and plunged into the Jiulongtan. It was difficult to stand firmly on the round boulders, not to mention wearing heavy diving suits. Lao Yao fell into the depths of more than ten meters as soon as he went down. Everyone on the shore sweated for him. The leaders and partners repeatedly advised him to rest before continuing, but he refused. He fell down, floated up, and continued working; his hands were broken, his feet were swollen, but he kept working. He worked for more than ten hours in a row and finally blasted away those big rocks. Later, Yao Xingen's initiative was summarized and improved into underwater blasting experience.

During the construction of the Huangtankou Hydropower Station project, under the education of the Party, Yao Xingen gradually understood for whom he was working and improved his class consciousness. In 1954, on "July 1st," he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

	The Construction Period Must Not Be Delayed
Lao Yao excellently completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party at the Huangtankou Hydropower Station construction site. Before the hydropower station was completed, he was transferred to the Jiangxi Shangyou Hydropower Engineering Bureau and accepted the task of building a new cofferdam.

The riverbed of the Shangyou River is different from other riverbeds, covered with a very solid layer of gravel, as solid as cast concrete. Even with more than 20 horsepower flushing equipment, only a layer of weathered skin can be flushed away. However, if this foundation clearing task cannot be completed on time, the sinking of wooden cages cannot be carried out, and the entire project will be delayed.

"Can a part of this hard cover layer be retained?" Yao Xingen pondered over and over again. He thought: "After clearing the cover layer, we have to pour concrete to build the cofferdam again, and this gravel is not softer than concrete." The next day, he told the engineer in charge of the cofferdam his idea. The engineer shook his head repeatedly and said: "Even if a little of the sand cover layer is retained, it will cause the wooden cage cofferdam to leak and affect the stability of the cofferdam. It must be completely removed."

Although Yao Xingen was rejected, he was still very confident: "I am a Communist Party member, and I must not allow the waste of state property, and I must not allow the project to be delayed." He told this suggestion to Tang Shaoju, the secretary of the Party branch, and Engineer He, a member of the Party branch. Engineer He decided to go down with him to take a look. The two slowly sank into the water seven or eight meters deep. After on-site observation, Engineer He and the engineering leaders agreed to Lao Yao's suggestion and left all the cover layer. This not only saved the country a large amount of funds, but more importantly, it enabled the cofferdam to be completed on schedule and won time.

	In the Face of New Difficulties
In 1957, the Xin'anjiang cofferdam project was under construction, and Lao Yao came there again, still doing his original job. However, he was now the captain of the cofferdam team.

Yao Xingen is the person who is least afraid of difficulties. As long as the superior assigns a task, he always says with a confident smile: "No problem."

Take the second-phase cofferdam project of Xin'anjiang as an example. It is really difficult to use wooden cages one by one to enclose and block the Xin'anjiang River. He was considering how to overcome this difficulty when Wang Xing, the director of the Engineering Bureau, and Chen Zan, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, came. Comrade Wang Xing and Comrade Chen Zan told him: there are definitely not enough workers, and materials are also lacking, but the project has to be advanced again. The second-phase cofferdam project must be closed in September, so that when Tiananmen Square set off fireworks on National Day in 1958, the excavation of the left bank foundation pit of Xin'anjiang will also fire the first shot. Comrade Wang Xing also said: "Lao Yao, electricity is needed everywhere, and there must be no delay in our work!"

"No problem," Yao Xingen still gave that familiar answer.

After the leaders left, he didn't sleep well for several nights. He discussed with the cadres in the team, and also talked with the workers. In a few days, he came up with the first "idea": start work early and pour the concrete cofferdam first. However, the people who transported the concrete sand and gravel were solved, but the people who poured the foundation were difficult to gather. What to do? He sat on the bow of the boat by the river, watching the workers clear the crushed stone from the concrete pouring area, transport it out, and transport the sand and gravel from afar. He suddenly thought: isn't this superfluous? Wouldn't it be better to use local materials and replace sand and gravel with crushed stone? At first, some people were worried that this would affect the quality. Yao Xingen and the concrete workers first did experiments together, proving that crushed stone can be used for low-grade concrete instead of stone, and obtained the consent of the chief engineer and the higher-level Party committee. As a result, more than 8,000 cubic meters of crushed stone were used in the second-phase cofferdam project, saving the country a large amount of money. This innovation also won time, enabling the project to be accelerated despite the lack of manpower and materials.

Under the leadership of the Party, and through the full efforts of Yao Xingen and the masses, the second-phase cofferdam project was completed ahead of schedule.

	On the Fuchunjiang River
After the completion of the second-phase cofferdam project, Yao Xingen immediately came to the Fuchunjiang Hydropower Station construction site. Facing another large hydropower station under construction in the motherland, how excited he was! But when his eyes touched the wooden cages, he fell into deep thought again. Before coming, he knew that due to the Great Leap Forward throughout the country, the demand for raw materials in all aspects increased, and the Fuchunjiang Hydropower Station cofferdam project had difficulties in raw material supply. The construction site workers put forward reasonable suggestions such as replacing wooden cages with bamboo cages upstream and downstream, replacing steel tie rods with bamboo tie rods, and using casing instead of drilling holes. Although these suggestions greatly reduced costs and accelerated the construction progress, the downstream cofferdam still needs to use wooden cages. Wood and iron parts are far from meeting the needs, so it is still in a semi-suspended state. "Can bamboo cages be used on top of the wooden cages?" Yao Xingen repeatedly thought, and came up with six plans to replace wood with bamboo, and submitted his suggestions to the Party committee.

The Party committee attached great importance to this suggestion and held several special research meetings. The mixed wooden cage and bamboo cage cofferdam was finally successful. The realization of this suggestion saved the country 2,500 cubic meters of wood and 20 tons of steel, solving the difficulty of lacking raw materials for the cofferdam project.

Wherever the Party Points, We Rush There
In June of this year, Yao Xingen was invited to the Guangxi Xijin Hydropower Station to support the cofferdam repair project. At that time, the cofferdam damage there was very serious, and some people even determined that this cofferdam could not be repaired. Yao Xingen knew that to repair this cofferdam, he must rely on collective wisdom. In order to better integrate with everyone, he moved to the workers' dormitory and ate and lived with everyone, and studied together to solve the difficulties. Finally, it was determined to repair the damaged wooden structure. However, repeated floods caused most of the repaired areas to be in the swirling flow area. If divers work in the rotating rapids, they are in danger of being swept away at any time. What to do? Seeing that the time was getting tighter and tighter, the Party committee organized discussions on ways to overcome the rapids. After joint research by Yao Xingen and workers, engineers, and technicians, it was decided to use the method of throwing rock to pick up the water weir and iron cage to block the flow. As a result, the problem was basically solved, and the underwater repair work followed up smoothly. However, some places were still in the rotating rapids. Yao Xingen decided to do this dangerous underwater work himself. After he went into the water, he fastened his body and air pipe with a rope to the underwater work site until the work was completed before coming up. Under the leadership of the Party committee of the Xijin Hydropower Station, and after 20 days of hard work by the workers, the severely damaged cofferdam was basically repaired. Yao Xingen's noble communist style has left an indelible impression on the vast number of cadres and workers of the Xijin Hydropower Station.

    红色潜水员姚新根
    姚新根现任富春江水电局围堰队队长。他自从1951年10月由上海船厂调到水电系统以后，曾先后在黄坛口、江西上犹、新安江、富春江水电站工作，并在今年6月去广西西津水电站帮助解决围堰损坏事故。不论到哪里，他都出色地完成了党所交给他的任务，因而获得了浙江省第一个五年计划工业劳动模范、1958年省社会主义建设积极分子等光荣称号。
        第一次考验
    1952年冬天，黄坛口水电站工程正在紧张地进行着建设。入夜，寒风掠过江面，江水被吹起一道道微波。姚新根立在沙滩上，浓眉紧锁，想着如何搬掉那滚滚江水中的几块庞大的石头。从三天前发现这几块大石头到现在，他的心就一刻也没有离开过它。现在，领导上派他到这里负责水下清基工作。这几块大石头不搬掉，围堰就不能在洪水期前合拢闭气，整个工程就得被迫停工。老姚虽然江里来、河里去地混了一、二十年，对水下的事了如指掌，然而这几块大石头却难住了他。他在江边上来回踱着，思想像眼前汹涌的激流一样，不停地滚动。“嘎！要是能够用起重机把这些大石头吊走该有多好，可是到那儿去找能起一百二十吨重的起重机呢？”他自问自答着。
    夜深了，姚新根慢步走回宿舍，一头倒在床上，久久不能成眠……
    次日清晨，开山炸石头的电炮声惊醒了他。这炮声竟启发了他。他想：山岩可以爆炸，水下的石头是不是也可以爆炸呢？他翻身坐起，连早饭也没有吃，就跑去告诉工程委员会的领导人。领导研究以后，同意姚新根进行试验，可是叫谁下去打眼呢？潜水工下去不会打钻，风钻工又不会潜水。
    “走！先学习打钻。”姚新根果断地说。
    在山坡上，姚新根连续练了十多个小时，手掌心震起了大血泡，终于学会了打钻的基本操作方法。他歇也不歇，穿起潜水衣，捧住风枪，就钻进了九龙潭。五十多方的滚圆的大石头，不用说穿着笨重的潜水衣，就是空身也难以在上面站稳。老姚一上去就跌进了十多米的深渊。岸上的人无不为他捏一把汗。领导上和伙伴们一再劝他歇一歇再干，他总是不肯。跌下去，浮起来再干；手跌破了，脚跌肿了，还是干，一连干了十多个小时，终于把那些大石头炸掉了。后来，姚新根的这个创举，被总结提高成为水下爆炸经验。
    在黄坛口水电站建设工程中，姚新根在党的教育下，逐渐懂得了为谁工作，提高了阶级觉悟，1954年“七一”光荣地参加了中国共产党。
      工期决不能推迟
    老姚在黄坛口水电站工地出色地完成了党交给的任务，没等到水电站建成，就调到江西上犹水电工程局，接受了修筑新围堰的任务。
    上犹江的河床与其它河床不同，复盖着非常牢固的一层砂砾石，就像浇筑的混凝土一样牢固。即使用二十多马力的冲水设备，也只能冲掉它的一层风化皮层。可是这个清基任务如果不能按时完成，木笼沉放就无法进行，整个工程就要推迟。
    “这样坚硬的复盖层，是不是可以保留一部分呢？”姚新根翻来复去地琢磨着。他想：“清除了复盖层，还得再浇混凝土建筑围堰，而这砂砾石并不比混凝土软。”第二天，他向负责围堰的工程师提出了他的想法。工程师连连摇头说：即使砂盖层保留一点，也会使木笼围堰漏水和影响围堰的稳定，一定要全部清除掉。”
    姚新根虽然碰了钉子，但他还是十分自信：“我是一个共产党员，决不能让国家财产白白地浪费，决不能让工程延期。”他把这个建议告诉了党支部书记唐绍举和党支部委员贺工程师。贺工程师决定跟他下去看看。两个人慢慢地沉入了七、八米深的水底，经过实地观察，贺工程师和工程领导同志同意了老姚的建议，留下了全部的复盖层。这不但替国家节约了大批资金，更重要的是使围堰能够如期完工，争取了时间。
        在新的困难面前
    1957年，新安江围堰工程正在兴建，老姚又来到了那里，干的还是本行。不过，他这时已是围堰队队长了。
    姚新根是最不怕困难的人，上级只要交下任务，他总是带着充满自信的微笑说：“没有问题。”
    就拿新安江的二期围堰工程来说，要用木笼一只只围起来，拦断新安江水，困难真是不少。他正在考虑如何克服这一困难，工程局的王醒局长和党委副书记陈赞同志来了。王醒同志和陈赞同志对他说：工人少，肯定不能满足需要，材料也缺乏，但是工程还得再提前。二期围堰工程要能在9月份合拢闭气，就能争取1958年国庆节天安门放礼炮时，新安江左岸基坑开挖也打响第一炮。王醒同志又说：“老姚，到处都需要电呀，咱们的工作可不能有半点迟缓！”
    “没有问题。”姚新根还是那个习惯了的回答。
    领导同志走后，他几夜没有好好睡。他找队里的干部商量，又找工人交谈，没几天便想出第一个“点子”：提前开工，先浇混凝土围堰。但是运混凝土砂石料的人解决了，浇捣基础的人又难以凑起来。怎么办？他坐在江边船头上，看着工人把浇混凝土位置内的碎石渣清出来，运出去，又把砂石料从远方运过来，忽然想到：这岂不是多此一举。就地取材，用碎石渣代替砂石料多好？一开始，有些人耽心这样做会影响质量。姚新根便同混凝土工人一起先作试验，证明碎石渣代替石料用于低标号混凝土是可以的，并得到主任工程师、上级党委的同意。结果在二期围堰工程中共计使用了八千多立方碎石渣，为国家节约了一大笔费用。这项革新也同样赢得了时间，使工程在人力、物力缺少的情况下得以加速建设。
    在党的领导下，经过姚新根和群众的全力奋斗，二期围堰工程提前完工了。
          在富春江上
    二期围堰工程完工后，姚新根立刻又来到了富春江水电站工地。面对着祖国又一个正在兴建的大型水电站，他是多么兴奋啊！但当他的视线一触到木笼上时，便又陷于深思。在未来之前，他就知道由于全国各地大跃进，各方面对原材料需要量增加，富春江水电站围堰工程在原料供应上发生了困难。工地职工提出了上下游竹笼代替木笼、竹拉条代替钢拉条，以及打套管代替钻孔等合理化建议。这些建议实现后，虽然大大降低了成本，加快了施工进度，但是，顺游线围堰仍然要用木笼，木料、铁件，远远不能满足需要，因此仍处于半停工状态。“木笼上面可以不可以再用竹笼呢？”姚新根反复地思考着，一连想出了六个以竹代木的方案，并向党委提出了他的建议。
    党委很重视这个建议，召开了几次专题研究会，木笼竹笼混合型围堰终于成功了。这一建议的实现，为国家节约了二千五百立方米木材、二十吨钢材，解决了围堰工程原料缺乏的困难。
  党指向哪里就奔向哪里
    今年6月间，姚新根被邀到广西西津水电站去支援围堰修复工程。当时那里的围堰损坏情况十分严重，甚至有人断定这条围堰已无法修复。姚新根知道要修复这条围堰，必须依靠集体智慧。为了更好地和大家打成一片，他搬到工人宿舍里和大家同吃同住，一块研究解决困难的办法，最后确定把破坏的木板结构修复。但是一次又一次的洪水使大部分修复地方都处于旋流地区。潜水工若在旋转的急流中工作，随时都有被卷走的危险。怎么办呢？眼看时间越来越紧迫，党委组织讨论战胜急流的办法。经姚新根和工人、工程师、技术员共同研究，决定采用抛块石挑水堰和铁笼挡流的办法，结果基本上解决了问题，水下修复工作也顺利地跟了上去。但是有些地方还是处在旋转急流中。这样危险的水下工作，姚新根决心自己去干。他下水以后，把自己的身体和空气管用绳子扣牢在水下工作的地点，直到工作完了再上来。在西津水电站党委的领导下，经过工人们二十天的奋战，损坏十分严重的围堰基本上修复起来了。姚新根的这种高尚的共产主义风格，在西津水电站的广大干部和职工中留下了不可磨灭的印象。
