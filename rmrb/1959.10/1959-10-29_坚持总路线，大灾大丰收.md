    Adhering to the General Line, Great Disaster, Great Harvest
    Guo Xingchun, First Secretary of the CPC Xin Zhou County Committee, Hubei Province
    Xin Zhou County, Hubei Province, is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River. It is a semi-plain and semi-hilly area, vulnerable to both drought and flooding. Although water conservancy construction has developed rapidly in recent years, production is still seriously threatened in the face of particularly severe disasters. This year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, we tamed three major mountain floods, overcame a historically rare hundred-day drought, and won a great bumper harvest in agricultural production. The total output of early rice, middle rice, and single-season late rice in the county, covering 440,000 mu, increased by more than 20% compared to the great bumper harvest of last year; a bumper harvest of more than 400,000 mu of late autumn crops is also a certainty. Many areas with poor natural conditions have also caught up this year. For example, the Yangluo People's Commune, with poor water source conditions, moved large amounts of lake water, achieving a grain yield that exceeded the plan. The Xinzhou Commune’s Gugang Management Area, once known as “Poor Gugang,” has increased its total output of rice crops by more than 150% compared to last year, and can achieve a plan of 1,000 jin of grain per person, becoming a banner for rice production increase in hilly areas. This is obviously a great victory. The people's evaluation of this year is: the biggest drought in a century, the biggest bumper harvest in a millennium. The facts are thus displayed before the people.
    How was the victory obtained? The practice of the past year has proven that firmly implementing the Party's General Line, persisting in carrying out socialist revolution continuously in political ideology, waging unremitting struggles against all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, and continuously giving play to the superiority of the people's communes, is the fundamental key to guaranteeing this victory.
    This year, the struggle between the two lines on the agricultural production front was very acute. Right-leaning conservative ideas are constantly attacking our ideological front from all sides; and our victory also began with achieving victory in ideological struggle. This spring, when the county party committee proposed: expanding the area of double-cropping rice, promoting the experience of rational close planting, and achieving high-speed development of agricultural production, a small number of people with right-leaning conservative ideas immediately rose up in opposition. They said, "Xin Zhou has poor natural conditions and often suffers from water and drought disasters. We should plant more middle rice and not expand double-cropping rice," saying that double-cropping early and late rice is "labor-intensive and unreliable," "a waste of manpower and money, not worth the effort," and so on. We adhered to the idea of continuous revolution, mobilized the masses, and launched a great debate on "Is it better to plant middle rice or to expand double-cropping rice? Is it better to wait for a bumper harvest or to seize a bumper harvest from nature?" Through big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and great debates, we widely summarized the high-yield models of double-cropping early and late rice, conducted comparisons, and carried out self-education by calculating the increase in production. The masses' thinking was cleared, right-leaning ideas were shattered, and the early rice area expanded from the original plan of 250,000 mu to more than 290,000 mu, an increase of 70% compared to last year. At the same time, we implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, commended advanced figures who dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to act, thus setting off a mass technical revolution movement. The depth of deep plowing increased from four or five inches last year to six or seven inches; the planting density of rice was also more reasonable than last year. Because the masses were mobilized more extensively and deeply this year, and the technical specifications were implemented more comprehensively and thoroughly, balanced development was basically achieved, thereby ensuring balanced production increase. All the facts show that on the road of technical revolution, "morale can be boosted, but not weakened."
    The struggle will not stop. When drought resistance began this summer, the county party committee put forward the policy of "long-term resistance, comprehensive resistance, and resolute resistance," right-leaning opportunists once again opposed us. They spread pessimistic and disappointing emotions everywhere, "blew cold winds" and "spoke cold words," and openly proposed: to proceed from "actual conditions," save early rice but not middle rice, and resist as much as possible. Under the influence of a small number of cold air, some areas also made plans to reduce the area of drought resistance and reduce the area of replanting. We did not show weakness, but adopted resolute struggle methods. The county summarized the two good and bad examples of Yangluo Commune's active drought resistance with remarkable results, and Phoenix Commune's right-leaning fear of difficulties with serious losses. Through meetings and visits, the masses were mobilized to conduct an in-depth discussion, starting from summarizing the local drought resistance struggle, comparing the two models, commending good people and good deeds, and criticizing right-leaning thoughts, so that a huge disaster resistance and production increase movement quickly unfolded.
    As the drought developed, the struggle became more intense. When some cadres and masses began to develop a war-weariness in their minds, right-leaning conservatives took the opportunity to say: "People are tired, hearts are exhausted, water is gone, cars are broken, crops are dried, and plans are difficult to guarantee," "Now we should open the cage and release the birds, and each go their own way." At this moment, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party issued the great call to "go all out, aim high, oppose right-leaning thoughts, and launch a vigorous and lively production increase and frugality movement." We immediately organized more than 29,000 Party propagandists and reporters, as well as more than 3,500 social propaganda forces, to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda activities. The call, like the east wind, set off a earth-shattering disaster resistance struggle; the call, like a bright light, pointed out the direction for people to move forward. All communes, through the insertion of red flags and the establishment of models, once again criticized right-leaning thoughts and put forward the battle cry of "not drying up one mu of field, not damaging a seedling, and not leaving an inch of land barren." Some areas that had not completed drought resistance and late rice planting successively carried out drought resistance and rushed to plant mud beans and buckwheat to make up for losses. The bugle call of "marching towards rivers and lakes" and "asking for water from rivers and lakes" was sounded everywhere.
    Right-leaning opportunists, they used the eyes of mice to estimate the superiority of the people's communes, opposed large-scale water movement, and opposed large-scale mass movements. They said: "Large-scale collaboration and large-scale water movement is 'large-scale idleness,' 'large-scale waste,' and 'large-scale formalism'"; saying that "a chain of waterwheels can save a line, but a large area will be dried to death." Under the inspiration of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, we organized the vast people to move large amounts of lake water and borrow large amounts of river water in 368 places, some of which crossed hills six or seven li to irrigate the fields. The Yangluo Commune used the commune's accumulated funds to buy more than 20 water pumps, and organized more than 7,000 laborers and more than 2,000 waterwheels to move large amounts of lake water to ensure a bumper harvest, based on the principle of equal exchange. More than 5,000 wells were dug, lakes were blocked, and dams were built in various places, and more than 240 new dry and branch canals were opened, completing 1.3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for the reservoir. The masses' enthusiasm soared to the sky, the movement was unstoppable, and the drought demon was powerless. A bumper harvest of more than 400,000 mu of late rice was guaranteed.
    Great disaster, great harvest, is the victory of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and is the victory of the people's communes. What we have learned from the victory is to faithfully and resolutely implement the Party's General Line, constantly wage tenacious struggles against right-leaning thoughts; to always implement putting politics in command, rely on the revolutionary masses, and fully play the superior role of the people's communes. Only in this way can we achieve continued leaps forward next year on the basis of this year's leap forward.
    We must never be satisfied with the status quo. We are determined to hold high the red flag of the General Line more firmly and forge ahead valiantly.

    坚持总路线，大灾大丰收
    中共湖北省新洲县委第一书记  郭兴春
    湖北省新洲县位于长江的北岸，是个半平原半丘陵的地区，既怕旱又怕淹。虽然几年来水利建设有了飞跃的发展，但在特大的灾害面前，生产仍然要受到严重的威胁。今年在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社的无比优越，驯服了三次大山洪，战胜了历史上罕见的百日大旱，夺得了农业生产大丰收。全县四十四万早稻、中稻和一季晚稻，总产量比大丰收的去年增加两成多；四十多万亩晚秋作物，丰收也已定局。许多自然条件差的地区，今年也赶上来了。像阳逻人民公社，水源条件不好，他们大搬湖水，实现了粮食产量超规划。一向被人称为“穷顾岗”的新洲公社顾岗管理区，今年各季水稻总产量比去年增加一倍半以上，可以实现每人千斤粮的规划，成为丘陵地区水稻增产的旗帜。这显然是一个伟大的胜利。人民群众对今年的评价是：百年未有的大旱灾，千年未有的大丰收。事实正是这样展示在人们的面前。
    胜利是怎样获得的呢？一年来的实践证明，坚决地贯彻党的总路线，坚持在政治思想上不断地进行社会主义革命，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，向形形色色的右倾保守思想开展不懈的斗争，并使人民公社的优越性不断地得到发挥，是保证这一胜利的根本关键。
    今年在农业生产战线上的两条路线的斗争，是非常尖锐的。右倾保守思想，总是不断地从各个侧面来冲击我们的思想阵地；而我们的胜利，也是从取得思想斗争的胜利开始的。今春，县委提出：扩大双季稻的面积，推广合理密植的经验，实现高速度地发展农业生产时，一小部分有右倾保守思想的人，马上起来反对。他们说：“新洲自然条件不好，常遭水旱灾害，应该多种中稻，不该扩大双季稻”，说什么早晚稻连作是“费工多，不保收”，“劳民伤财，得不偿失”等等。我们坚持了不断革命的思想，发动群众，开展了“是种中稻好，还是扩大双季稻好？是坐等丰收，还是向自然夺取丰收”的大辩论。通过大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论，广泛地总结了早晚稻连作的高产典型，进行了对比、算增产账的自我教育。群众的思想通了，右倾思想粉碎了，早稻面积从原计划二十五万亩扩大到二十九万多亩，比去年扩大了70％。与此同时，贯彻了农业八字宪法，表扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的先进人物，从而掀起了群众性的技术革命运动。深翻的深度由去年的四、五寸，提高到六、七寸；水稻种植的密度，也比去年更加合理。由于今年群众发动的比较广泛、深入，技术规格也执行得比较全面、彻底，基本上做到了平衡发展，从而保证了平衡增产。一切事实说明，在技术革命的道路上，也是“气可鼓，而不可泄”。
    斗争是不会停止的。今夏抗旱开始，县委提出了“长期抗、全面抗、坚决抗”的方针，右倾机会主义分子又出来和我们对立了。他们到处散布悲观失望的情绪，“吹冷风”“说凉话”，并公开提出：要从“实际出发”，救早稻不救中稻，抗多少算多少。在一小股冷空气的影响下，有的地区还作了缩小抗旱面积，缩小复种面积的打算。我们没有示弱，采取了坚决斗争的办法。全县总结了阳逻公社积极抗旱，成绩显著，和凤凰公社右倾畏难，损失严重的两个好坏典型，通过会议、参观，发动群众，对照两种典型，从总结本地抗旱斗争入手，进行了一次深入的讨论，表扬了好人好事，批判了右倾思想，从而一个规模巨大的抗灾增产运动迅速地开展起来了。
    随着旱情的发展，斗争更加激烈。当部分干部和群众，开始在思想上滋长了一种厌战情绪的时候，右倾保守主义者就乘机出来说：“人累了，心尽了，水完了，车坏了，庄稼干死了，规划难保了”，“现在应该开笼放雀，各奔前程”。正当这个时候，党的八中全会，发出了“鼓足革命干劲，反对右倾思想，开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动”的伟大号召，我们立即组织了二万九千多个党的宣传员和报告员，以及三千五百多个社会宣传力量，开展了广泛地深入地宣传活动。号召像东风一样，掀起了翻天复地的抗灾斗争；号召像明灯一样，指出了人们前进的方向。各公社通过大插红旗，广树标兵，再次批判了右倾思想，提出了：“不干死一亩田，不损坏一棵苗，不荒芜一寸地”的战斗口号。有些没有完成抗旱插晚稻的地区，纷纷地开展了抗旱抢种泥豆、荞麦，以弥补损失。各地吹响了“向江河湖泊进军”，“向江河湖泊要水”的战斗号角。
    右倾机会主义分子，他们用老鼠眼睛来估计人民公社的优越性，反对大搬水，反对大搞群众运动。他们说：“大协作，大搬水就是“大窝工”，“大浪费”，“大形式主义”；说什么“水车一条龙，救起一条线，旱死一大片”。我们在党的八中全会的鼓舞下，依靠人民公社的无比优越，组织了广大人民在三百六十八处大搬湖水，大借河水，有的翻过了六、七华里的山岗来灌溉田地。阳逻公社用公社积累资金，买了二十多部抽水机，本着等价交换的原则，组织了七千多劳力，二千多水车，大搬湖水，保住了丰收。各地打井、堵湖、筑坝达五千多处，新开干、支渠二百四十多条，完成了水库的土、石方一百三十万。群众干劲冲天，运动势如破竹，旱魔无能为力，四十多万亩晚稻稳得丰收。
    大灾大丰收，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是人民公社的胜利。从胜利中我们学到的，就是要忠实地坚决地贯彻党的总路线，不断地向右倾思想作顽强的斗争；要永远地实行政治挂帅，依靠革命群众，充分地发挥人民公社的优越作用。只有如此，才能在今年跃进的基础上，实现明年的继续跃进。
    我们绝不能满足现状。我们决心更坚定地高举总路线的红旗，大踏步地奋勇前进。
