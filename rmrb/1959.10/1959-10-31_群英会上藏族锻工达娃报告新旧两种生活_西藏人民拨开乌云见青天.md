Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Dawa, a Tibetan blacksmith from the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory of the Tibet Transportation Bureau, shared his personal experiences at the National Conference of Heroes today. He indignantly denounced the heinous crimes of the feudal serf system and enthusiastically praised the Party and Chairman Mao for transforming him from a slave into a master of the country. In his speech, Dawa also sternly condemned the US imperialism and foreign interventionists for interfering in China's internal affairs, as well as the shameless conspiracy of the United Nations in illegally passing the so-called "Tibet issue" resolution. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause, and the representatives unanimously expressed their joy for the complete liberation of Dawa and all the Tibetan people. The following is an excerpt from Dawa's speech:

    My name is Dawa. I used to be a slave, and now I am a worker at the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory. In the dark years of feudal serfdom, dark clouds filled the sky, and our Tibetan people lived a tragic life of oppression and exploitation for generations. When I was eight years old, my father was persecuted to death. Basang, a lackey of the rebel leader Yuto, forcibly dragged my brother and me to be slaves. From then until 1956, when I was twenty-seven years old and finally escaped from the clutches of the serf owner, I lived like an animal for nineteen years. During those nineteen years, I never knew what it meant to have enough to eat. Sometimes, when I was too hungry to bear it, I would secretly take the serf owner's dog food to survive. Whether it was winter or summer, whether it was windy or snowy, I could only sleep outside the serf owner's door like a dog. The tattered cotton-padded coat that my father left me when he died never left my body for more than ten years. It was patched so many times that it couldn't be patched anymore, and in the end, only a few rags were left hanging on my body. The cruel serf owners endlessly ordered me to work, and if I didn't do well, they would whip me. When I was thirteen years old, I couldn't bear their cruel torment anymore, so I ran away, but I was caught and taken back. They hung me upside down for three days, smoked my eyes with chili peppers, beat me all over, and finally sold me to another serf owner. All the jackals in the world are equally vicious. At that time, they held the power, and there was no way for the poor to survive! My mother offended the Dzongpon (the Dzongpon was equivalent to a county magistrate) with a single sentence. They whipped her pregnant belly one hundred and fifty times, and the blood stained the ground red. The serf owner falsely accused my brother of stealing, beat him until his skin was torn and his flesh was rotten, and threw him into the dungeon. To this day, I don't know if he is alive or dead. Three of my cousins were killed. One was burned to death with a red-hot iron shovel, one was beaten to death with a stick, and the youngest brother starved to death. These man-eating beasts ruined my family, leaving me alone and without relatives. The blood debt the serf owners owed me is as deep as the sea!

    In 1951, Tibet was peacefully liberated. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, like the sun, illuminated the hearts of the Tibetan people. However, the imperialists and the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet were unwilling to see the rebirth of the Tibetan people. They wanted to ride on our heads and do whatever they wanted forever, sucking our blood and sweat. In March of this year, the extremely evil reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet launched an armed rebellion. They raped, killed, and burned everywhere, and brutally murdered Han and Tibetan cadres. Under the leadership of our great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army quickly wiped out the rebels and began democratic reforms. Ula corvée and personal dependence have all been abolished. The shackles that had been on the necks of slaves for thousands of years have been broken. Only then did the millions of serfs truly break through the dark clouds, see the blue sky, and achieve complete liberation, becoming masters of their own destiny.

    However, US imperialism and foreign interventionists are not reconciled to their failure. They bitterly hate the liberation of our Tibetan people and are racking their brains to carry out sabotage and interference. On the 21st of this month, under the manipulation of US imperialism, the United Nations illegally passed a so-called "Tibet issue" resolution, shamelessly interfering in our country's internal affairs. We want to tell the imperialist wolves and all imperialist elements, we advise you to be honest. The Tibetan people have stood up, and Tibet is China's Tibet. Quelling the rebellion and carrying out democratic reforms are China's internal affairs and the demands of the Tibetan people. The United Nations has no right to interfere at all! We firmly support the solemn statement of our government and angrily protest the shameless interference of imperialism in our country's internal affairs.

    In 1956, I escaped from the home of the serf owner Ada Aba and ran for four nights to find the People's Liberation Army. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army introduced me to work as a worker in the logging yard. Later, in order to train me to become a great warrior of the working class and a skilled worker, the Party sent me to the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory to learn blacksmithing. When I was learning blacksmithing at the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory, I encountered many difficulties, both in learning and in work, and I didn't understand many things. But I was not afraid. If I didn't understand, I asked the master; if I couldn't do it, I studied hard and practiced diligently. In this way, under the kind and patient guidance of the Han Chinese masters, I was basically able to work independently in a few months. In order to build a socialist new Tibet, I also strictly demanded myself in my work. Every day, I came to the workshop before dawn, lit the furnace, and tidied up the tools; in the evening, when the comrades went home, I would carefully check the work I had done that day and leave after cleaning the workshop thoroughly. I also actively and conscientiously taught the techniques that the master taught me to the later Tibetan workers, and promoted the Party's ethnic policies to them. Under the close unity of Han and Tibetan workers, our blacksmithing group became an advanced group, and I was named an advanced producer by my comrades. I also came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland and the National Conference of Heroes. What makes me extremely happy is that I met our great leader Chairman Mao, whom our people of all ethnic groups respect and love, and saw the brilliant achievements of the great leap forward in socialist construction of our great motherland. This is the greatest happiness in my life. My experience is the common experience of thousands upon thousands of serfs in Tibet. The old society turned us into slaves, and the new society, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao turned us slaves into masters of the country. (Attached picture)

    群英会上藏族锻工达娃报告新旧两种生活
    西藏人民拨开乌云见青天
    据新华社30日讯　西藏运输局拉萨汽车修配厂锻工达娃，今天在全国群英大会上以亲身的经历，愤怒地控诉封建农奴制度的滔天罪行，热情地歌颂党和毛主席使他从奴隶变成了国家的主人。达娃在发言中还严厉地斥责了美帝国主义和外国干涉者干涉我国内政，以及联合国非法通过所谓“西藏问题”决议的无耻阴谋。他的发言一再为暴风雨般的掌声所打断，代表们一致为达娃以及全体西藏人民的得到彻底解放而感到高兴。达娃的发言摘要如下：
    我叫达娃，从前是个奴隶，现在是拉萨汽车修配厂的工人。在黑暗的封建农奴主统治的年月里，乌云满天，我们藏族人民世世代代都过着被压迫被剥削的悲惨生活。我八岁的时候，父亲被逼死了，叛匪头子宇妥的狗腿子巴桑，硬把我和我的哥哥拖去作了奴隶。一直到1956年我二十七岁的时候，我最后一次从农奴主的魔掌中逃出来为止，整整过了十九年的牛马生活。在这十九年当中，我从来不知道什么叫吃饱饭，有时候饿的实在支撑不住，就偷偷地拿农奴主的喂狗食来度命。不论是冬天还是夏天，不管是刮风还是下雪，我都只能像狗一样睡在农奴主的门外边。我爹死时给我留下的一件破袄，十几年没离过身，补的都没办法补了，最后只剩下几条破布披挂在身上。残暴的农奴主，他们无尽无休的叫我干活，稍不如意就用鞭子抽打。在十三岁那年，我实在受不了他们残酷的折磨了，就逃了出来，结果被捉回去。他们把我倒吊了三天，用辣椒烟熏我的眼睛，打得我遍体鳞伤，最后还把我卖给另一家农奴主。天下的豺狼都是一样的狠毒。那时候刀把子、印把子在他们的手中，那能有穷苦人一点点活路啊！我的母亲因为一句话得罪了宗本（宗本相当于县官），他们就在她怀了孕的肚子上抽了一百五十皮鞭，血把地都染红了。农奴主诬赖我哥哥偷东西，打得他皮开肉烂，抛进了地牢，到如今我也不知道他的死活。我的三个堂兄弟，一个被他们用烧红的铁铲子烫死，一个被他们用棍子打死，最小的兄弟是给活活饿死的。这些吃人的野兽，弄得我家破人亡，举目无亲，农奴主欠我的血债，就像大海一样深！
    1951年，西藏和平解放了。毛主席、共产党像太阳一样，照亮了藏族人民的心。可是，帝国主义和西藏上层反动分子，是不愿意藏族人民新生的，他们想永世骑在我们头上作威作福，吸榨我们的血汗。今年3月，万恶的西藏上层反动分子更穷凶极恶地发动了武装叛乱。到处奸淫烧杀，残害汉、藏干部。在我们伟大的毛主席、共产党领导下，人民解放军很快荡平了叛匪，并且开始了民主改革。乌拉差役、人身依附统统废除了，千百年来套在奴隶脖子上的枷锁打碎了，百万农奴这才真的拨开了乌云，见到了青天，得到彻底的翻身，成为自己命运的主人。
    但是，美帝国主义和外国干涉者，却不甘心他们的失败，他们切齿痛恨我们藏族人民翻身，挖空心思的进行破坏和干涉。本月21日，在美帝国主义操纵下，联合国竟非法通过了所谓“西藏问题”的决议，无耻地干涉我国内政。我们要告诉帝国主义野心狼和一切帝国主义分子们，劝你们还是放老实点吧，西藏人民已站起来了，西藏是中国的西藏。平定叛匪，进行民主改革是中国的内政，是西藏人民的要求，联合国根本无权过问！我们坚决拥护我国政府严正的声明，愤怒抗议帝国主义对我国内政无耻的干涉。
    1956年我从农奴主阿达阿巴家逃了出来，跑了四夜找到了解放军。解放军同志介绍我到伐木场当工人。以后党为了培养我成为伟大的工人阶级的战士，成为一个技术工人，又送我到拉萨汽车修配厂学锻工。在拉萨汽车修配厂学锻工的时候，不管在学习上，还是在工作上，都遇到了很多困难，好多东西都不懂。但是我不怕。自己不懂，就问师傅，自己不会，就勤学苦练。就这样，我在汉族老师傅亲切耐心的教导下，几个月就基本上能单独做工作了。为了建设社会主义的新西藏，在工作上我也严格要求自己。每天在天不亮时就来到车间，生好熔炼炉，整理好工具；晚上同志们回家了，我还要把当天干的活仔细检查一遍，把车间打扫得干干净净再离开。我还把老师傅教给我的技术，积极认真地教给后来的藏族工人，向他们宣传党的民族政策。在汉藏工人亲密的团结下，我们锻工小组成为了先进小组，我被同志们评为先进生产者。我还来到北京，参加伟大祖国建国十周年的观礼，和全国群英大会。使我感到万分高兴的是，我见到了我们各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，看到了我们伟大祖国社会主义建设大跃进的辉煌成就。这是我有生以来最大的幸福。我的经历，是西藏千千万万农奴的共同经历。旧社会把我们变成了奴隶，新社会、共产党、毛主席使我们奴隶变成了国家的主人。（附图片）
