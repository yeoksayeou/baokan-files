    "Spring Thunder" Inspires
    Li Chao
    In 1927, the "spring thunder" of the proletariat revolution resounded on both banks of the Xiang River. The spring thunder awakened dormant life, and the revolutionary tide set off a stormy peasant revolutionary movement, writing an exciting page in our revolutionary struggle history. The opera "Spring Thunder" performed by the Central Experimental Opera House is precisely a story reflecting the peasant revolutionary struggles on both banks of the Xiang River on the eve of the Autumn Harvest Uprising. Tang Zhen, the leader of the county peasant association, and Pan Yaxiong, a staff member, mobilized the masses to organize peasant associations and led the peasants by Lotus Lake to fight against local tyrants like Pan Rongzhai, etc. In the struggle, the young peasant Ye Xiaorong grew up, and the rural girl Man Meizi was cultivated. However, under the erroneous leadership of right-leaning opportunism, this peasant revolutionary movement sacrificed many revolutionary comrades and activists of the peasant association, causing losses to the revolution. This bloody experience was only a profound lesson for revolutionaries but could not shake the confidence of proletarian revolutionary patriots. The author expressed this meaningful ideological theme through the form of opera art with this unwavering revolutionary confidence and enthusiasm, and a magnificent momentum.

    "Hand-planting rice seedlings brings worry, bending over and toiling until half-dead, who will reap the harvest in autumn? The farmers by Lotus Lake find it difficult to survive on bran and sweet potatoes." This opening chorus expresses the pain and hatred in the hearts of Hunan farmers in 1927, laying the roots of conflict for the development of the entire play. As the plot develops, Pan Da'die's story of the local tyrant Pan San forcing the girl Lamei to death further advances the class contradiction, but the real contradiction begins after Pan San and Pan Rongzhai appear on stage. They abduct Man Meizi to the Pan family and want to continue manipulating the fate of the peasants by seizing the rising peasant association. However, the mobilized peasants are no longer afraid of the coercion of local tyrants and evil gentry. Under the leadership of the Party, the peasants established peasant associations and took up weapons to capture Pan San. This sharp and victorious class struggle was ruined by right-leaning opportunists within the Party, allowing Pan Rongzhai and other evil gentry, and Li Guoliang, a Northern Expedition officer who openly betrayed the revolution, to succeed in their plot to incorporate the peasant armed forces, destroy the peasant association, and kill revolutionary cadres and peasants. This conflict between the enemy and us runs through the entire play, and the audience is always concerned about the success or failure of the peasant revolutionary movement. At the same time, the play also runs through another struggle, namely the struggle between the left and right revolutionary lines. The author arranged for Yi Zongxiu, a right-leaning intellectual, to be worried in the face of the mass movement, fearing to offend the local tyrants and evil gentry. When the masses rise up, he cannot withstand the wailing and intimidation of the landlords and local tyrants. He pities their feigned pitiful appearance and fears their threats, resulting in only compromise and letting the enemies go. When Li Guoliang, who betrayed the revolution, conspired to sabotage the peasant armed forces, the right-leaning Yi Zongxiu was frightened and stood on the side of the enemy, arguing with Tang Zhen, who insisted on the struggle, and finally abandoning the revolution. Through the development of this contradiction, the author describes the two different attitudes of true Marxists and right-leaning opportunists towards the mass revolutionary movement and dealing with the enemy, portraying vivid images of proletarian revolutionaries and wavering elements.

    The author's mastery of the development and transformation of antagonistic contradictions between the enemy and us and internal contradictions within the revolution to reflect a revolutionary historical theme is undoubtedly a very successful design and arrangement; however, the shortcoming is that the internal relationship between these two contradictions has not been fully explored, and the development of the two clues has not been completely intertwined. The dramatic action is intermittent and lingering, unable to be completed in one go. For example, the enemy-us contradiction described in the play, which caused the spring thunder-like peasant movement, is precisely because the class contradiction has developed more sharply, so it is required that the play can express the essence of this class oppression and exploitation more profoundly and vividly. However, what is written in this script is that the class oppression is outlined in the lyrics, while the vivid and concrete artistic description is that the landlord class does not treat the poor as human beings and tramples on them at will. Of course, this is also one aspect of the essence of the exploiting class, but our description of class struggle will never be limited to Pan San forcing Lamei to death and robbing Man Meizi, especially when the peasant revolutionary movement has already risen. Therefore, the originally strong dramatic action not only fails to summarize the oppression of local tyrants and evil gentry, but also makes people feel that the contradictions in the play are not solid and credible; not only has the contradiction of Man Meizi's abduction not been tightened with the entire class contradiction, but also Pan Yaxiong's in-depth exploration of his uncle's house to find out the conspiracy of local tyrants and evil gentry is not fully developed. It is said that the cadres of the county peasant association returning to the tiger's den of their uncle's house, from the opposition of positions and from the complex relationship between relatives, this scene should push the contradiction to a more acute and complex level. However, the author may have wanted to avoid making the play monotonous and dry, but instead drew it to the relationship between Li Guoliang wanting to marry Pan Yaxiong. Of course, we do not object to the description of these details, but we hope that these plots are more in line with that typical prescribed situation, so that these descriptions are more reasonable. Because this is a life-and-death struggle, even if Li Guoliang really has affection for Pan Yaxiong, he would not marry a revolutionary at this time, so if this plot is arranged more reasonably, it will not only dig out the essence of the local tyrants and villains more deeply, but also portray the characters more meticulously and tighten the contradictions more tightly.

    In the play, the relationship between the development and transformation of internal contradictions within the revolution and the hostile contradictions can be said to be well written. First of all, the author not only describes figures such as Tang Zhen, Pan Yaxiong, Pan Da'die, and Man Meizi, but also shapes a typical image of right-leaning. Whether he is afraid of mass struggle, shows great compassion in front of the enemy, or his words and arguments, all make the audience burst into laughter. This expression is due to his class origin. When the mass movement rises up, it is indeed not painting and embroidery. The vigorous revolution will make those who stand behind and point fingers feel terrified, and they will always consciously or unconsciously stand on the opposite side to oppose the peasant movement. They find the enemy's shout of "It's terrible" pleasing to the ear, and the enemy smells their congenial odor and comes to woo and buy them off. However, in this play, the author has not tightly grasped the scene of Pan Rongzhai escaping in disguise and encountering Yi Zongxiu, and the scene of Li Guoliang attempting to incorporate the peasant picket隊, to write out the enemy's conspiracy to attack from within the fortress. The contradiction needs to be revealed concisely, without more ink to describe Yi Zongxiu's personal love contradictions and ridiculousness. If more space is left here to better strengthen Pan Yaxiong's struggle behavior and help and education to Man Meizi, so that the play has more opportunities to portray the revolutionary spring thunder awakening the conscious peasants; in this way, perhaps the contradictory conflicts between the two lines will be more tightly combined, making the contradictions more complex and acute, more dramatic, and more able to deeply portray the characters, exert the theme, and be more moving and persuasive. Perhaps it can concentrate more, highlight Tang Zhen's wit and decisiveness in leading the work, make Pan Yaxiong's firm and courageous qualities more distinct, and also depict Ye Xiaorong and Man Meizi's gradual growth in the revolutionary movement, allowing the audience to see a more glorious revolutionary prospect.

    “春雷”振奋人心
    李超
    1927年，湘江两岸响起了无产阶级革命的“春雷”。春雷唤醒了蛰伏的生命，革命的浪潮掀动了暴风骤雨般的农民革命运动，在我们革命斗争史上写下了激动人心的事迹。中央实验歌剧院演出的“春雷”就正是反映秋收起义前夕湘江两岸农民革命斗争的故事。县农会领导人唐震和工作人员潘亚雄，发动群众组织农会，领导了莲子湖边的农民向土豪潘容斋等人进行了斗争，在斗争中成长了青年农民叶小荣，培养了农村姑娘满妹子。但是这个农民革命运动在右倾机会主义的错误领导下，牺牲了许多革命同志和农会的积极分子，给革命造成了损失。这血的经验对革命者来说只是一次深刻的教训，却动摇不了无产阶级革命志士的信心。作者就以这坚定不移的革命信心和热情，磅礴的气势，通过歌剧艺术的形式表现了这一有意义的思想主题。
    “手栽黄秧心发愁，弯腰折背累半死，到得秋来归谁收？莲子湖畔种田人，糠皮红薯难糊口。”开场的这个合唱正道出1927年湖南农民心底的苦痛和仇恨，为整个戏的发展埋下了冲突的根源。随着剧情的发展，由潘大爹唱出土豪潘三逼死腊梅姑娘的一段故事，这就更形象地把阶级矛盾向前推进了一步，但是真正的矛盾开始还是在潘三和潘容斋上场以后，他们把满妹子劫夺到潘家去，还想抓住正在兴起的农会，继续操纵农民的命运。但是发动起来的农民再不畏土豪劣绅的威迫，农民们在党的领导下办起了农会，拿起了武器捉到了潘三。这个尖锐的、胜利的阶级斗争却被党内的右倾机会主义者葬送了，让潘容斋等劣绅和公开叛变革命的北伐军官李国梁等人得逞，企图收编农民武装，捣毁了农会，杀害了革命的干部和农民。这一敌我矛盾冲突贯串着全剧，观众时刻在关心着农民革命运动的成败。同时，全剧还贯串着另一种斗争，那就是左与右的两条革命路线的斗争，作者安排了易宗秀这样一个右倾的知识分子，在群众运动面前忧心忡忡，深恐得罪了土豪劣绅，当群众起来的时候，他经不起地主土豪的哀鸣和恫吓，他既怜悯他们装出的可怜像，又害怕他们的威胁，结果只有妥协，放走了敌人。当出卖革命的李国梁阴谋破坏农民武装的时候，右倾的易宗秀就吓得站在敌人的方面和坚持斗争的唐震争吵，最后终于脱离了革命。作者通过这个矛盾的发展，描述出真正的马克思主义者和右倾机会主义者看待群众革命运动和对付敌人的两种不同态度，刻划出无产阶级的革命者与动摇分子的生动形象。
    作者掌握了对抗性的敌我矛盾和革命内部矛盾的发展、转化来反映一个革命历史题材，无疑是一个非常成功的设计、安排；但是美中不足的是这两个矛盾的内在关系还没被充分挖掘，两条线索的发展还没能完全纠缠在一起，戏剧动作若断若续，藕断丝连，不能一气呵成。比如剧中所描写的敌我矛盾，所以引起了春雷般的农民运动，正是由于阶级矛盾发展的更加尖锐，因此要求戏中能把这一阶级压迫、剥削的矛盾的本质，形象地表现得更深刻生动。但在这剧本中所写的是以唱词概述了阶级压迫，而形象的、具体的艺术描写却是地主阶级不把穷人当人任意践踏，当然这也是剥削阶级本质的一个方面，但是我们对阶级斗争的描写绝不会只限于潘三把腊梅逼死，抢走了满妹子，特别是当农民革命运动已经起来的时候。因此本来很强烈的戏剧动作不但不能概括土豪劣绅的压迫，反而使人感觉戏中的矛盾不够结实可信；不但满妹子被劫的矛盾还没能和整个的阶级矛盾拧紧，就是潘亚雄深入伯父家里探听土豪劣绅的密谋这一敌我矛盾的推进也还欠充分发挥。按说县农会的干部回到虎狼窝的伯父家里，从立场的敌对，从亲属间的复杂关系来看，这场戏应该是把矛盾推向更尖锐更复杂，但是，作者也许为了使戏不单调干巴，却又拉到李国梁要娶潘亚雄的男女关系上去了。当然我们不反对这些细节的描写，但是我们更希望这些情节更合乎那个典型的规定情景，使这些描写更合情入理。因为这是你死我活的斗争，即使是李国梁对潘亚雄真有爱慕之心，他也不会在这时机和一个革命党结婚，所以如果把这一情节安排的更合理，不但会更深的挖出土豪恶棍的本质，也可以把人物性格刻划的更细致，把矛盾拧的更紧。
    在剧中革命内部的矛盾发展、转化和敌对矛盾的关系，应该说是写得好的。首先作者不但描写了唐震、潘亚雄，潘大爹、满妹子等人物，也塑造了一个右倾的典型形象，不管他在害怕群众斗争的时候，还是在敌人面前大发慈悲的行为，以及他的言谈论调，都使观众不禁发出笑声。这种表现是由于他的阶级出身所致。当群众运动起来后，的确就不是绘画绣花，轰轰烈烈的革命会使那些站在后头指手划脚的人见而生畏，他们总是自觉不自觉地站到对面来反对农民运动。他们对敌人喊的“糟得很”听着顺耳，敌人闻到他们的气味相投也就来进行拉拢、收买。但是在这戏中作者还没有紧紧的抓住潘容斋化装逃跑遇到易宗秀的戏，和李国梁企图收编农民纠察队的场景，写出敌人从堡垒内部进攻的阴谋，要精练的把这矛盾揭示出来，而不要更多的笔墨去描写易宗秀个人的恋爱矛盾和可笑，如果在这里多留些篇幅更好地把潘亚雄的斗争行为以及对满妹子的帮助教育的戏加强，使戏更有机会刻划革命的春雷唤醒了觉悟的农民；这样，也许会使两条线的矛盾冲突结合的更紧，使矛盾更复杂尖锐，更富于戏剧性，更能深刻的刻划人物，发挥主题，也更能感人而有说服力。也许因之更能集中，更能突出唐震在领导工作中的机智果敢，更能使潘亚雄那坚定、英勇的品质愈加鲜明，也更能描画出叶小荣和满妹子等人在革命运动中逐步的成长，使观众看到更光辉的革命远景。
