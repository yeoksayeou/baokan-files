　　Crossing the Jialing River, a picture of "One Network, Five Transformations" unfolds before you. Every main road leading to major docks, factories, mines, market towns, and villages has intricate branch lines, these branches covering the Jiangbei County like countless centipedes.
　　Arriving at the Shuidi Town dock in Jiangbei County, several wooden tracks stretching directly to the ship greet you. Groups of people push handcarts, shuttling back and forth on the tracks to transport goods. These tracks are all made of small pieces of wood, with a gauge of only a little over one Chinese foot. Some wooden tracks are even nailed with copper-coin-thick iron sheets, extending all the way to the Jiangbei Machinery Factory under the county. Once in the factory area, they divide into many forks, crisscrossing and covering the entire factory. Here, there are also interesting "native" electric tram tracks, using very small iron rails, with thin wooden poles on both sides supporting the antenna, and the "native" electric tram made of waste materials. It looks really "native," but each car can tow more than two tons of goods.
　　Near a coal mine near the Jiangbei Machinery Factory, a 20-plus-kilometer-long "native" railway in the spiderweb-like roads is also quite attractive. It is paved with small iron rails, and the "native" locomotive running on it is made from a car engine. The long train of "carriages" are all large baskets woven from bamboo strips. Although it is both "native" and small, it can haul seventy or eighty tons in one trip.
　　Past the coal mine, continuing forward. Bypassing several mountain ranges, you arrive at the Liuyin District, where transportation used to be extremely inconvenient in the county. We visited the Dakang Iron Plant in this district. Stepping into the Dakang Iron Plant, we walked along a long wooden track into the mountains. The mountains ahead were higher than the last, like a stack of Arhats. At the end of the wooden track, you can immediately see what the masses call "flying in the sky." In this steep mountain and deep valley, five aerial ropeways woven from bamboo strips were erected in the air. Workers摇着wood winches, and many bamboo baskets full of ore and pig iron were hung on the ropeway, flying back and forth. The uppermost ropeway is connected to a new wooden track. When this track extends to the foot of a steep cliff, it is connected to a straight climbing chute. The coal on the mountain slides down the chute with a crash. This is one kind of "cliff slide;" there is also a cable car track pulled by bamboo ropes. In many factories and mines in this high mountain and deep valley area, all rely on these wooden tracks, ropeways, cable cars, and chutes, which are built according to the terrain and using local materials, to connect each other, so that the transportation of various raw materials and finished products is smooth and unimpeded.
　　In this county, not only docks, mines, and factories, but also in the fields of some people's communes, a network of roads extending in all directions has been established. Jingguan People's Commune alone has built more than 130 kilometers of wooden tracks this year and made more than 1,300 vehicles. These tracks connect all 26 management districts, 390 drying grounds, warehouses, feedlots, and more than 200 canteens and shops in the commune. Through these wooden tracks, commune members use hand-pulled or ox-pulled carts to transport fertilizer to the fields; to send feed into the pig troughs; to send coal to the kitchens of the commune canteens; and to send the newly harvested grain to the drying grounds and warehouses.
　　In the Jingguan Commune, the heavy manual labor of carrying on shoulders and backs has been replaced by vehicles that shuttle back and forth.
　　When visiting the Dakang Iron Plant, we really wanted to see an old friend - Wang Kecheng. When we came here in January this year, he was extremely busy. Every day he held a large megaphone, stood on the high mountains and shouted himself hoarse, dispatching troops everywhere and making a rush to transport. At that time, even though he had more than 500 people under his command carrying ore and coal, the blast furnace still complained of not being full every day. When we met him this time, we also habitually called him the transportation team leader. But he jokingly said: "I am not the transportation team leader anymore, I have been 'unemployed' for a long time"! Then he said leisurely: "Since we started to vigorously promote 'One Network, Five Transformations' this year, and built tracks, ropeways, and chutes, not only is transportation not tight here, but the number of transportation personnel has also been reduced from more than 500 to 17. I, the transportation team leader, have also been 'unemployed' and changed to become the director of the ironmaking workshop."
　　He led us around and pointed to the five aerial ropeways in the high mountains and deep valleys and said: "Don't look at these few bamboo ropes and winches, they transport 120 kilograms per minute, and more than 57,000 kilograms in eight hours, which is equivalent to one or two hundred people carrying it all day in the past. Wooden track and chute transportation are also very 'powerful'. Engaging in 'One Network, Five Transformations' is really a good prescription for liberating labor and solving the tension in short-distance transportation!"
　　In the Jiangbei Iron and Steel Plant, we saw that the ore and fuel needed were transported from dozens of miles away, crossing high mountains. The director of the Party Committee Office of the plant introduced: Half a year ago, even though the number of transport workers here was increased to 2,000, it was still necessary to frequently mobilize cadres and family members to rush to transport day and night. Even so, the blast furnace was still in a state of severe semi-starvation. The transport workers reflected: "It's either uphill or downhill, carrying on our backs and shoulders is really annoying, carrying until our backs are sore and our legs are weak, and the blast furnace is still calling for hunger." In April this year, the members of the nearby people's communes and the factory workers fought day and night, taking the highway as the trunk line, and built 46 wooden tracks, winches, and chutes, and hundreds of vehicles, and built a transport network based on tracks, connecting chutes and ropeways directly to the mines. Now, the situation has completely changed. These tracks easily undertake the transportation of more than 400 tons of ore and fuel every day, ensuring that each blast furnace is fully fed, while the number of transport workers has been reduced from 2,000 to 720.
　　The "One Network, Five Transformations" chart exhibited by the Jingguan People's Commune also has these comparative figures: In the past, 5,482 people were responsible for transportation, accounting for more than 60% of the commune's labor force. After the establishment of the road network, there are now only 1,624 people, accounting for only 20% of the commune's labor force. In this way, the commune has extracted 70% of the transportation labor force and put it into agricultural production.
　　The benefits of "One Network, Five Transformations" are most deeply felt by the laborers who used to carry on their backs and shoulders. They wrote thousands of poems to praise "One Network, Five Transformations". Sun Zhongyi, a porter at the Shuishi Town Wharf, told us: Since the wharf has implemented native mechanization such as native cranes and wooden tracks, the workers have written a poem to describe the current labor situation: "The left hand pushes the car forward, the right hand holds a fan to shake the cool breeze. No matter how heavy the car is loaded, pushing and fanning is as fast as a shuttle." On a wall newspaper run by the members of the Jingguan People's Commune, there were all poems praising "One Network, Five Transformations", one of which wrote: "Wooden tracks are really comfortable, transporting more things and saving effort; although it is said to be a native thing, it is the first in terms of more, faster, better, and more economical." A representative from the Northeast who came to visit the "One Network, Five Transformations" in Jiangbei County sighed after seeing the dense road network of the Jiangbei Iron and Steel Plant: "We always want to do something bigger and more foreign, but we can't always do it. Short-distance transportation is as tight as a thousand-pound stone pressing on our bodies. Here, people are doing a lot of small, native, and mass things, but it's so easy. We must promote it well when we go back."
　　The road network in Jiangbei County is composed of more than 2,000 various tracks, with a total length of 3,000 kilometers. It is amazing that a county has so many tracks. But what is even more surprising is that such a huge number of tracks were all built in a month and a half from the end of last year to the beginning of this year.
　　How were so many built so quickly? The Secretary of the Jiangbei County Party Committee told me: "This is what is called the great power of the people's commune!" "In our mountainous county, the people have suffered enough from the inconvenience of transportation in the past." He continued with deep emotion: "At that time, short-distance transportation was also getting tighter day by day, and everyone had thought about building roads. It's just that under the conditions of agricultural cooperatives, it is impossible to draw so much manpower and take out so many materials in a short period of time to build such a large transportation network in the county. Besides, agricultural cooperatives have their own boundaries and different conditions. If you are willing to build, I am not willing to build. If you have the conditions to build, I don't have the conditions to build, how can we make overall plans and establish a transportation network on a large scale."
　　After communization, these many difficulties were solved easily. The Jingguan People's Commune built more than 130 kilometers of wooden tracks in a short period of more than a month. It powerfully proves the superiority of the commune. The county organized tens of thousands of labor forces and a large amount of materials in one fell swoop, and built a powerful transportation network in the county in a short period of more than a month, which is a testament to the great power of the commune.

    路似蛛网车穿梭
    本报记者　胡明俊　徐宜
    渡过嘉陵江，一幅“一网五化”的图景就展现在面前了。每条通往主要码头、厂矿、场镇、村落的干道，都有错综复杂的支线，这些支线像无数条蜈蚣布满了江北县境。
    船到江北县水地镇码头，迎面是好几条直伸到船上的木轨道，一群群人推着土手车，在轨道上穿梭般来往运货。这些轨道全用小块木材制成，轨距仅有一市尺多，有的木轨还钉着铜钱厚的铁皮，一直伸到县属的江北机械厂。一到厂区，便分成许多叉道，纵横交错，布满全厂。这儿，还有有趣的土电车道，用的是很小的铁轨，两旁的细木柱架着的天线，废料做的土电车。看来真算土气透了，可是每辆却能拖挂两吨多货物。
    在江北机械厂附近的一个煤矿，蛛网般的道路中，有一条二十多公里长的土铁路也是够吸引人的。它用小小的铁轨铺成，上面行驶的土火车头是用汽车引擎做的，长长一列“车厢”，全是用竹篾编的大筐。虽是又土又小，一趟却要拖七、八十吨。
    过了煤矿，再往前行。绕过几重山峦，便到了过去全县交通极不方便的柳荫区。我们参观了这个区的大矿铁厂。踏进大矿铁厂，我们便沿着一条长长的木轨道往山里走去。前面的大山一座高过一座，像叠罗汉似的。走到木轨道尽头，便一眼瞅见群众说的“天上飞”了。在这陡峭的高山和深谷间，凌空架起五条用竹条编成的架空索道，工人们摇着木绞架，索道上挂了许多满装矿石、生铁的竹筐，飞来飞去。最上一根索道，又和一条新的木轨道连接起来。当这条轨道伸到一个陡峭的高崖脚下，又和一条挺直的爬山溜槽连在一起。山上的煤就顺着溜槽哗啦啦地滑溜下去。这就是“崖边溜”的一种；还有一种是用竹绳牵引的缆车道。在这高山深谷地区的许多厂矿，就全靠这些根据地形、就地取材修成的木轨道、索道、缆车、溜槽，把彼此衔接起来，使各种原料、成品的运输，畅通无阻。
    在这个县境，不仅是码头、矿山、工厂，一些人民公社的田间，也建立起四通八达的道路网。静观人民公社，单是今年便建成了一百三十多公里的木轨道，造了一千三百多辆车。这些轨道沟通了全社二十六个管理区、三百九十台晒坝、仓库、饲养场和两百多个食堂、商店。社员们通过这些木轨道，用手拉或牛拉车，把肥料送到田里；把饲料送进猪槽；把煤炭送到公社食堂的灶房；把打完的新谷送到晒坝和仓库。
    在静观公社，肩挑背负的繁重体力劳动，已由往来如梭的车辆代替了。
    参观大矿铁厂时，我们很想见见一位老朋友——王可成。今年1月我们来这儿，他可忙极了。天天拿着个大喇叭筒，站在高山上力竭声嘶地大喊大叫，到处调兵遣将，突击运输。那时，尽管他手下有五百多人担矿挑煤，高炉还是天天闹吃不饱。这次我们和他见面，也习惯地称呼他运输队长。他却笑谑地说：“我不当运输队长了，老早‘失业’哪”！接着他满悠闲地说：“自从今年大搞一网五化，大修轨道、索道、溜槽以后，这里不但运输不紧张了，运输人员也由五百多人减少到十七人了。我这个运输队长也就“失业”改行当炼铁车间主任了。
    他领我们边参观，边指着高山深谷间的五条架空索道说：“别看这是几个竹索、绞架，它们一分钟要运一百二十公斤，八小时就运五万七千多公斤，要顶从前一两百人挑一天了。木轨道、溜槽运输也很‘关火’。搞一网五化，可真是解放劳动力、解决短途运输紧张的好药方！”。
    在江北钢铁厂，我们看到需用的矿石、燃料、都要翻过高山从几十里外运来。厂党委办公室主任介绍说：半年前，尽管这里的运输工人增加到两千，仍然要经常发动干部、家属昼夜突击运输。即使这样，高炉还是处于严重的半饥饿状态。运输工人们反映：“不是上坡就下坡，人背肩挑真恼火，挑得腰酸脚杆软，高炉还叫肚子饿。”今年4月份，附近的人民公社社员和全厂职工日夜奋战，以公路为干线，修造了四十六条木轨道、绞车、溜槽，和几百辆车子，建成了以轨道为主、连接溜槽、索道直通矿井的运输网。现在，情况就完全变了。这些车道每天轻巧地担负起四百多吨矿石、燃料的运输，保证高炉一个个吃得饱饱的，而运输工人却由两千人减到七百二十人。
    静观人民公社展出的一网五化图表中，还有这样一些对比数字：以前担负运输的有五千四百八十二人，占全社劳动力的60％多。建立道路网后，现在只有一千六百二十四人，仅占全社劳动力的20％。这么一来，全社就抽出了70％的运输劳动力投入了农业生产。
    一网五化的好处，从前肩挑背负的劳动者体会最深。他们写了成千首诗歌来颂扬一网五化。水土镇码头搬运工人孙忠义告诉我们：自从码头上搞了土吊车、木轨道等土机械化后。工人们写了这样一首诗来形容现在的劳动情景：“左手推车往前走，右手执扇摇凉风。那管车载多少重，边推边扇快如梭”。静观人民公社社员们办的一张壁报上，全是歌颂“一网五化”的诗歌，其中一首写道：“木轨道真安逸，多运东西少费力；虽然说是土玩意，多快好省数第一”。一位东北来参观江北县一网五化的代表看了江北钢铁厂繁密的道路网后，感叹地说：“我们老想搞大一点洋一些的，却老搞不起来，短途运输紧张得像身上压块千斤大石。这儿人家大搞小、土、群，却那么轻轻松松的。回去定要好好推广。”
    江北县的道路网，是两千多条各种车道构成的，总长度有三千公里。一个县拥有这么多的车道是惊人的。但更令人感到惊奇的，是这么巨大数量的车道，都是在去年底到今年初的一个半月内修成的。
    怎么修得这么多，这么快呢？中共江北县委书记告诉我：“这就叫人民公社力量大啊！”“在我们这个山区的县份，过去人民吃够了交通不便的苦头。”他深有感慨地继续说：“那时，短途运输也一天比一天紧，大家也曾想到修建道路。只是在农业合作社的条件下，要短期内在全县范围搞起这么大的交通网，一下抽不出这样多的人力，也拿不出这么多的材料。再说，农业社各有地界，各有不同条件，你愿修，我不愿修。你有条件你修，我没条件修，又怎能在大的范围内统筹规划，建立交通运输网呢。”
    公社化后，这许多困难都迎刃而解了。静观人民公社在短短一个多月内，修起了一百三十多公里的木轨道。有力地证明了公社优越性。全县一下组织数以万计的劳动大军和大量材料，在一个多月内，突击建成全县范围的强大交通运输网更是公社伟大力量的证明。　（孙慕玲插画）（附图片）
