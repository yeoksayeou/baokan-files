Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 13th: "Lao Patriotic News" reported on October 10th that the Lao people's national salvation movement against the US-Sananykon clique has been widely launched in the central and lower Laos provinces in September.

　　In the provinces of Khammouane, Pakse, and Attapeu, the people held hundreds of mass rallies, distributed thousands of leaflets, and wrote thousands of protest letters, severely condemning the intervention of US imperialism and the Sananykon reactionary clique's conspiracy to expand the civil war.

　　In various villages, young people are enthusiastically participating in self-defense forces, while elders and women are actively participating in the "Defend and Build Villages" movement.

　　In Pakse province, the US-Sananykon clique's acts of persecution and slaughter of the people have met with fierce resistance. From September 17th to 24th, the people's armed forces repulsed the Sananykon troops stationed at the Dong Dara stronghold, seizing all their weapons, and dozens of royal army soldiers were killed, wounded, or surrendered. Under the people's strong struggle, the royal army in the Sukuma area of Pakse province and the Bountai area of Attapeu province were very panicked and had to withdraw from their strongholds. The people's armed forces seized a batch of weapons, including three light machine guns and some grain and property that the Sananykon army had looted from the people during the "sweeps."

　　In Khammouane province, guerrillas surrounded the Thakhek stronghold and ambushed a batch of royal army troops who were setting out on a "sweep." They killed a royal army captain and seized two rifles.

　　At the end of September, a company of Sananykon troops surrounded and attacked Donphone, attempting to eliminate the people's armed forces. With the help of the people, the people's armed forces safely withdrew from the encirclement and counterattacked. The royal army panicked and had to retreat. As a result, a royal army captain was killed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 13th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, "Lao Patriotic News" revealed on October 10th the crimes committed by the Sananykon army in various parts of Laos in recent times.

　　The newspaper said that during the "sweeps" conducted by the Sananykon army in some areas from the end of August to mid-September, they killed seventeen people, imprisoned two hundred and thirty-seven people, and burned down forty villages. They are implementing a brutal scorched earth policy in some areas.

　　In Bakfi, Namdien, Muknei and other places in Muang Houn district, the Sananykon army captured and raped about one hundred women aged from fourteen to fifty. During the "sweep" of Ban Die and Songphone villages, 30 kilometers south of Phongsaly city, the Sananykon army tied up a woman's husband and raped her in front of her husband. In Luang Prabang province, at the end of August, when the Sananykon army was "sweeping" Mukar village in Basaeng district, they suspected that the village chief's son was a liaison for the Lao combat forces and shot him dead. The village chief was very angry and joined the people's ranks, resolutely resisting the US-Sananykon clique's "sweeps." In Xieng Khouang province, on August 16th, the Sananykon army arrested seventy former Lao combat force cadres and demobilized soldiers in Muang Khoon district, northeast of Xieng Khouang province, and took them to the Banban area for torture and torment.

　　The newspaper said that in order to further persecute the people and facilitate conscription, the US-Sananykon group also drove the people into concentration areas. As of now, the Sananykon group has forcibly concentrated 7,000 people in Sam Neua city, Luang Prabang province, and Vientiane province alone. The newspaper concluded by saying: "The more brutal the US-Sananykon group is, the more the people will hate them, and therefore will be more determined to fight them to the end."

　　老挝人民广泛展开救国运动
    各地群众奋起自卫击退王国军队扫荡
    新华社河内13日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”10月10日报道：老挝人民反对美国—萨纳尼空集团的救国运动9月份在中寮和下寮各省广泛展开。
    在甘蒙、巴色、阿速坡各省，人民举行了成百次群众大会，散发了成千张传单，写了成千封抗议书，严厉谴责美帝国主义的干涉和萨纳尼空反动集团扩大内战的阴谋。
    在各个村子里，青年们正踊跃参加自卫队，父老们和妇女们积极参加“保卫和建设村庄”运动。
    在巴色省，美国—萨纳尼空集团迫害、残杀人民行为遭到人民的激烈反抗。从9月17日到24日，人民的武装击退了驻在东达拉据点的萨纳尼空军队，缴获了全部武器，有几十名王国军队被击毙、击伤或投降。在人民强烈斗争下，巴色省苏库马地区和阿速坡省本特地区的王国军队十分慌张，并且不得不撤出据点。人民的武装力量缴获了一批武器，其中有三支轻机枪和萨纳尼空军队在“扫荡”中抢去的人民的一些粮食、财产。
    在甘蒙省，游击队包围它空据点，并且阻击了正在出发去“扫荡”的一批王国军队。他们击毙王国军队一名队长，并缴获两支步枪。
    9月底，萨纳尼空的一个连包围、袭击敦封，企图消灭人民的武装力量。人民的武装力量得到人民的帮助，安全撤出了包围圈并且进行反击。王国军队惊慌失措不得不撤退。结果，王国军队的一名上尉被击毙。
    据新华社河内13日电　据越南通讯社报道：“老挝爱国新闻”10月10日揭露了萨纳尼空军队最近一个时期在老挝各地犯下的罪行。
    这家报纸说，从8月底到9月中旬，萨纳尼空军队在一些地方进行的“扫荡”中，打死了十七人，监禁了二百三十七人，烧毁了四十个村庄。他们正在一些地方实行残酷的烧光、杀光、抢光政策。
    在芒珲县的巴克菲、南电、木内等地，萨纳尼空军队把约一百名从十四岁到五十岁的妇女抓去强奸，在对丰沙里市以南三十公里的班碟、松丰村进行的“扫荡”中，萨纳尼空军队把一个妇女的丈夫绑起来，并且在她丈夫面前强奸了她。在琅勃拉邦省，8月底萨纳尼空军队在巴生县木卡村“扫荡”的时候，怀疑乡长的儿子是寮国战斗部队的联络员，把他枪杀了。乡长非常气愤，就投到人民队伍方面来，坚决抵抗美国—萨纳尼空集团的“扫荡”。在川圹省，8月16日，萨纳尼空军队在川圹省东北面的芒扣县逮捕了前寮国战斗部队的干部和复员军人七十名，并押到本班地区进行拷打和折磨。
    这家报纸说，为了进一步迫害人民和便于抓丁，美萨集团还把人民赶到集中区。截至目前为止，仅桑怒市、琅勃拉邦省和万象省就有七千人被萨纳尼空集团强迫集中起来。这家报纸最后指出：“美国—萨纳尼空集团愈残暴，人民就愈仇恨他们，因而将更加坚决地同他们斗争到底。”（附图片）
