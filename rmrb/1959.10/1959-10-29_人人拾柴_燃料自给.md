The Xinji People's Commune in Guannan, Jiangsu is a well-known poor commune in the county. The entire commune has 4,245 households with a population of over 18,700, averaging 2.4 mu of land per person, of which 80% is alkaline soil, 13% is sandy soil, and 7% is silty soil. Due to the scarcity of land and poor soil quality, the amount of firewood burned has historically been insufficient. In 1951, when the state supplied grain, each household received a card, and fuel followed the grain, with 2 jin of coal supplied for every jin of grain based on the certificate. In 1957, 8 million jin of coal were supplied, averaging 1,884 jin per household. In 1958, with the bumper harvest in agriculture, the state still supplied 260,000 jin of coal.

What is the fuel situation this year? The commune party committee estimated that there would still be a shortage of two months' worth of firewood this year. In order to properly arrange the lives of the commune members, they also used the methods of increasing production and saving to solve the problem of insufficient fuel. The first step was to harvest and clear the crops in the fields thoroughly, not wasting a single blade of grass or tree, cherishing grass as much as grain, and mobilizing every household to collect grass, with everyone pitching in. In this way, more than 2,870 students in the entire commune can collect 80,000 jin of grass every month by using holidays and spare time, and more than 6,000 women and semi-laborers can collect an average of 2 jin of grass per person per day, totaling 360,000 jin per month. From now until "Xiaoman" (Grain Full) next spring, a total of 3 million jin of grass can be collected. Secondly, measures were taken to save fuel. According to calculations, saving 4 liang of grass per person per day, from now until "Xiaoman" next spring, a total of 900,000 jin can be saved. There are many ways to save, such as repairing and building stoves, frequently shoveling pot ash, burning broken grass on sunny days, and burning whole grass on cloudy days, so that basic self-sufficiency in firewood burning can be achieved, saving coal for the country for other economic construction.

    人人拾柴　燃料自给
    江苏灌南新集人民公社是全县闻名的穷社。全公社四千二百四十五户，一万八千七百多口人，平均每人二亩四分地，其中花碱土占80％，沙土占13％，淤土地占7％。由于土地少，土质坏，烧草历年不足。在1951年国家供应粮食的时候，每户发一张卡片，燃料跟粮食走，一斤粮食二斤煤，凭证供应。1957年供应煤炭八百万斤，平均每户有一千八百八十四斤。1958年农业大丰收，国家还供应了煤炭二十六万斤。
    今年的燃料情况怎样呢？公社党委计算了一下，今年还要缺两个月的烧草。为了妥善地安排社员生活，他们也用增产与节约的办法来解决燃料不足的问题。首先是把田里的庄稼收好拾清，不抛撒一草一木，爱草如爱粮，发动户户拾草，人人动手。这样全公社二千八百七十多个学生，每月可以利用假日和课余时间拾草八万斤，妇女和半劳力六千多人，每人每天平均拾草二斤，每月可拾草三十六万斤。从现在起至明春“小满”止，共计可拾草三百万斤。其次，采取措施，节约燃料。据计算，每人每天节约四两草，从现在起至明春“小满”止，共可节约九十万斤。节约方法很多，例如修制锅灶，勤铲锅灰，晴天烧碎草，阴天烧整草等等，就能做到基本烧草自给，可以替国家省下煤炭用于其他经济建设方面。　（灌南县委通讯组）
