Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th: The National "Meeting of Heroes" has sparked an increasingly surging new high tide in industrial production. As of the 26th, a large number of factories and enterprises in Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places have completed their October production plans ahead of schedule. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Medium Plate Mill, Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory, and Jilin's three major chemical plants have also completed their October production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. The cities of Harbin, Jinan, and Mudanjiang have completed their October city-wide total industrial output value plans ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 28th: Under the slogan of "Surpass September in October, and Strive for a Complete Victory," the workers on Shanghai's industrial front have been presenting the National Meeting of Heroes with achievements of completing state plans ahead of schedule. According to statistics up to the 27th, more than 250 factories have already completed their October production plans ahead of schedule.

In October, Shanghai's factories promoted the competition to compare with, learn from, and catch up with the advanced, through the activity of evaluating advanced production collectives and advanced producers, making it even more enthusiastic and widespread. The advanced collective unit attending the National Meeting of Heroes—Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant—carried out the competition in depth, completing the October steelmaking production plan ahead of schedule by seven days and exceeding the target. The workers of the advanced unit attending the National Meeting of Heroes—Shanghai Boiler Factory—put forward 813 innovation proposals in October, of which more than 400 have been adopted, improving production efficiency. The factory's October production task has already been completed ahead of schedule on the 26th.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 28th: In Tianjin, as of the 26th, 119 factories have completed their October production plans ahead of schedule. Many factories have achieved guarantees of daily red and ten-day red (meaning fulfilling production targets daily or every ten days).

Inspired by the National Meeting of Heroes, the workers on Tianjin's iron and steel industrial front have been waging an even more fervent battle to seize steel, with steel production rising daily. The average daily production of qualified steel on the 24th and 25th increased by more than 400 tons compared to the average daily production level in mid-October. On the 24th, the workers of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant also created the highest daily production record since the plant was built.

The workers of Tianjin Tractor Factory, Tianjin Chemical Plant, and many advanced teams and groups attending the National Meeting of Heroes have created new achievements after their representatives entered Beijing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 28th: As of the 26th, more than 60 factories and mines in Chongqing have completed the October state plan ahead of schedule, presenting the National Meeting of Heroes.

The Changjiang Electric Motor Factory, which is responsible for the production of electric motors, expanded the entire month's plan by 11% at the beginning of October. Each workshop, section, and group formulated specific measures to carry out an overproduction campaign of "competing at the beginning of the month and not catching up at the end." The entire factory saw a situation of "daily overproduction and ten-day high production." It completed the October state plan five days ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, with the total output value exceeding September by 3.8%. Chongqing Air Compressor Factory achieved more than 35,000 technical innovations in more than 20 days, increasing work efficiency by one to ten times respectively, and completed the October plan on the 24th. Many small and medium-sized enterprises, such as Gailanxi Steel Plant, Dongxi Iron Plant, and Tongxin Coal Mine, have also successively completed their October plans ahead of schedule.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 28th: After the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's 13 rolling mills launched a competition, the workers of the No. 1 Medium Plate Mill took the lead, completing the October state plan comprehensively in terms of quality and quantity five days ahead of schedule on the 26th. As of the 27th, the plant's average daily output of steel increased by 13% compared to September; the pass rate of steel increased by 1.2% compared to the state plan; and costs were reduced by more than 162,000 yuan.

As of the 24th, the factory had produced 30 more "Liberation" brand automobiles than the monthly plan, and created a new record of continuous high production from the 19th to the 24th since production began. In this month, the factory also saved 736.5 tons of steel, and the average scrap rate was reduced by 50% compared to September; safety in production was also unprecedentedly good.

Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of the No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant adopted the form of a production campaign to organize the enthusiasm of the masses of workers, carried out technical innovations on a large scale, and tackled weak links, realizing an all-round leap forward in various production tasks.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 28th: The three major chemical plants of Jilin Chemical Industry Company completed the October state plan eight days ahead of schedule, presenting the National Meeting of Heroes.

Since September, the company has launched an ideological education campaign centered on opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale among more than 30,000 workers. It has successively convened advanced producer meetings, worker congresses, and safety production mobilization meetings. Through these meetings, right-leaning thoughts were thoroughly criticized, and then a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy was launched. During the movement, leaders at all levels of the company implemented a system of rotating day and night shifts, ensuring the normal progress of production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 28th: The workers of Harbin City completed the October total industrial output value plan ahead of schedule by four days, exceeding the target by 1.3%, with an average daily output value increasing by 7.4% compared to September.

The output of many important industrial products, such as bearings, measuring tools, electrical appliances, woolen textiles, power generation, rubber shoes, calcium carbide, toothpaste, relays, aluminum, alcohol, fountain pens, and knitted underwear, exceeded the monthly plan.

The convening of the National Meeting of Heroes gave great encouragement to the vast number of workers on Harbin's industrial front. The competition to compare with, catch up with, and surpass the advanced was further developed in various factories, and production leaped again and again. For example, Harbin Bearing Factory held multiple performance competitions in October to promote advanced experience. Workers put forward 5,111 rationalization proposals in four days from the 23rd to the 26th, and realized 1,028 of them. By the 27th, the total output value plan had been completed, exceeding the target by 41.5%.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 28th: The workers of various factories in Jinan City completed the October total industrial output value plan ahead of schedule on the 26th, presenting the National Meeting of Heroes.

Entering October, the factories and enterprises in Jinan City continued to deeply implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, launched mass movements on a large scale, and launched a competition craze of "learning, catching up, surpassing, and helping." They carried out technical innovations and technical revolutions on a large scale, and widely summarized and promoted advanced experience, promoting the step-by-step increase in production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 28th: The workers of Mudanjiang City launched a new high tide of comprehensive leap forward in increasing production and practicing economy, presenting the National Meeting of Heroes with outstanding achievements. After completing the third quarter plan ahead of schedule, the city's workers have completed the October total industrial output value plan ahead of schedule by seven days.

Mudanjiang has continuously carried out technical innovations and technical revolutions on a large scale, and conscientiously summarized and promoted advanced experience. At the same time, many enterprises have further strengthened enterprise management, and cadres have gone deep into the forefront of production, leading production in a down-to-earth manner and solving various problems in production in a timely manner. As a result, output has increased and costs have decreased. (Attached pictures)
