　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 9th, TASS dispatch: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a speech at a mass rally of builders of the Bratsk hydroelectric power station on the Angara River in Siberia on the 8th. He said that all conditions now exist to prevent war and ensure lasting world peace.

　　He said that a new situation has emerged that is unprecedented. Socialist countries now have more than one billion people. Considering the rapid economic growth of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and our ever-increasing strength, it is obvious that it is not easy for imperialists to launch a war now. Khrushchev said that the aggressive forces know that if they launch a war, they will be playing with fire and burn themselves.

　　Khrushchev said that the fact that Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers have created rockets that enable us to launch powerful artificial satellites and three cosmic rockets into the universe also restrains the imperialists. Now, distance no longer has the significance it once had. If war breaks out, the flames of war will quickly spread throughout the world. Even the most rabid warmongers are beginning to understand this more and more clearly.

　　Khrushchev said that during his visit to the United States, he had very beneficial talks with President Eisenhower and many meetings with people from all walks of life in the United States. Khrushchev said, I think all this will help consolidate peace and help the two countries establish good mutual relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the people of all countries are increasingly clearly seeing the superiority of the socialist system.

　　Khrushchev said that our situation is very good. I am convinced that in the near future, on the basis of further development of production and science and technology in the Soviet Union, and on the basis of technological progress and production automation, people will only work three or four hours a day. In such a short time, people will produce much more products than they do now.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that this year, the Soviet Union's plan for industrial development will be overfulfilled. According to preliminary statistics, the annual plan will be completed by 104％ to 105％, and approximately 40 to 50 billion rubles worth of products will be produced beyond the plan. This year, due to the drought, the grain harvest in some areas will be less than last year, but there will be plenty of food. As of October 5, 2,711 million poods of grain have been purchased nationwide, and procurement work is still in progress.

　　Xinhua News Agency, October 10th, TASS report: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, returned to Moscow from Novosibirsk today.

　　Khrushchev visited the scientific center of Novosibirsk and talked with scientists from the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the newly opened Novosibirsk University.

　　A mass rally of the working people was held in the city of Novosibirsk. Khrushchev delivered a speech at the meeting. He talked about the Soviet Union's domestic and international situation.

　　Khrushchev arrived in Novosibirsk from Krasnoyarsk on the 9th.

　　赫鲁晓夫在布拉次克水电站发表演说
    侵略势力如果发动战争必将玩火自焚
    苏联今年发展工业计划任务将要超额完成
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫8日在西伯利亚安加拉河上布拉次克水电站建设者的群众大会上发表了演说。他说，现在有一切条件来防止战争和保证世界持久和平。
    他说，现在出现了前所未有的崭新局面。社会主义国家现在有十亿多人口。如果考虑到苏联和其他社会主义国家经济的迅速增长和我们日益增强的实力，那就十分明显，帝国主义者现在要发动战争是不容易的。赫鲁晓夫说，侵略势力晓得，如果他们发动战争，他们将玩火自焚。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人创造了这样的火箭，使我们能够向宇宙发射强大的人造卫星和三个宇宙火箭，这一事实也约制住帝国主义者。现在，距离已经不具备以前的意义。如果爆发战争，战火会迅速地蔓延到全世界。甚至连最狂妄的战争贩子都开始越来越清楚地懂得这一点了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在访问美国期间，他曾同艾森豪威尔总统举行过很有益的会谈，并且同美国各界人士进行很多次会晤。赫鲁晓夫说，我想这一切将有助于巩固和平、有助于两国在和平共处原则基础上建立良好的相互关系。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，世界各国人民越来越清楚地看到社会主义制度的优越性。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的情况很好，我深信，在不久的将来，苏联在进一步发展生产和科学技术的基础上，在技术进步和生产自动化的基础上，人们每天将只工作三、四小时。在这样短的时间中，人们生产的产品将比现在多得多。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，今年，苏联发展工业的计划任务将超额完成。根据初步统计材料，年度计划将完成104％至105％，并将超计划生产大约四、五百亿卢布的产品。今年由于天旱，某些地区的谷物收成将比去年有所减少，但是粮食将是充裕的。截止10月5日，全国已经采购了二十七亿一千一百万普特谷物，采购工作目前还在继续进行。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天由新西伯利亚回莫斯科。
    赫鲁晓夫访问了新西伯利亚的科学中心，并同苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院和新近开办的新西伯利亚大学的科学家们谈了话。
    新西伯利亚市内举行了劳动人民群众大会。赫鲁晓夫在大会上发表了演说。他谈到了苏联国内外局势问题。
    赫鲁晓夫是9日从克拉斯诺雅尔斯克到达新西伯利亚的。
