Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. Guangdong Province's 35 million mu of late rice promises a bumper harvest. Farmers throughout the province have launched a conservation movement focused on preventing and combating drought, determined to fight the final battle to ensure a good harvest.

This year's late rice in Guangdong, after more than two months of careful field management, especially after the anti-Rightist campaign, boosting morale, and a major battle against backward rice, the vast majority of rice seedlings have risen to first and second class, growing uniformly and strongly, with a high number of ears, even better than last year's bumper harvest. Now, only twenty days away from the busy harvest season, millions of mu of fast-growing rice are already ripening, with abundant and full grains. Farmers in various areas report that, based on the growth of the rice seedlings, if there are no disasters, each mu will increase production by several tens to hundreds of jin compared to last year's late rice.

Despite the imminent harvest of late rice, the yield is not yet entirely determined. Recently, Guangdong's weather has been dry with no rain, and varying degrees of drought have appeared in various areas, with more than two million mu of rice seedlings affected by drought; some areas are threatened by "Cold Dew" winds, insects, rats, and animal pests. Party committees at all levels in Guangdong Province immediately took emergency measures, mobilizing the masses to launch a conservation movement focused on preventing and combating drought. In the four special zones of Foshan, Jiangmen, Shaoguan, and Shantou, more than 600,000 people have been using more than 100,000 waterwheels, water scoops, and pumps day and night to pump water for irrigation; or opening diversion channels to draw water from mountain ponds and reservoirs for irrigation. In Hua County, the more than 35,000 members of the drought resistance army in various people's communes, led by more than 2,000 cadres including commune Party committee secretaries, members, and brigade general branch secretaries, worked hard day and night, irrigating more than 54,000 mu of land in two days, accounting for more than 90% of the total drought-affected area. The vast majority of drought-affected rice fields throughout the province have also been irrigated at least once. Recently, there have been many northwesterly winds, and the evaporation rate of water is high, and it is also the time when rice grains need moisture for grouting, so the consumption of water is also higher than usual, which has increased the task of drought resistance. However, the vast number of farmers are highly motivated, and they are determined to overcome the drought and seize a bumper harvest.

Areas in Guangdong Province that have discovered insect, rat, and "Cold Dew" wind damage have also immediately organized insect extermination, rat extermination, and cold resistance movements. In the counties of Panyu, Sanshui, Zengcheng, and Conghua in the Foshan Special Zone, where insect and rat damage is relatively serious, tens of thousands of people are mobilized every day to carry out surprise insect and rat extermination. In each commune, cadres take the lead, dividing areas and assigning responsibility, adopting a combination of chemical killing and hunting, and a comprehensive encirclement and suppression method, which quickly and basically eliminated insect pests and killed more than six million rats.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 12th. After the public announcement of Communiqué and Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Guangxi has deepened the anti-Rightist campaign, continuously boosted morale, and the rural over-production contract competition movement has risen step by step, with the late-rice and dry-land crop late-stage field management deepening. At present, more than 11 million mu of late rice in the region has reached more than three feet in height, universally containing panicles and heading, and nearly 10 million mu of coarse grains and oil crops are successively flowering and bearing fruit, presenting a scene of bumper harvest everywhere. People's communes in various areas, according to the ideological trends of cadres and the masses, repeatedly launched a large-scale airing of views, big debates, and big character posters around the questions of "Do we want a small harvest, a medium harvest, or a large harvest?", "Is the increase in production a certainty?", "Can we wait for a harvest?" criticizing complacency and further liberating thinking. The vast number of cadres and commune members are in high spirits, and late-stage field management is carried out vigorously. In the less than twenty days from late September to early October alone, the newly accumulated fertilizer in various areas increased from more than 800 million dan to more than 1.7 billion dan; the "field army" and shock troops eating and living in the fields increased from nearly one million people to about 1.5 million people. The number of cadres in the four special zones of Nanning, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Guilin who were sent down to production teams to serve as grassroots leaders increased from more than 70,000 to 112,600, and with their specific help, most of the backward production teams jumped into the ranks of the advanced. This new and extremely favorable situation has greatly promoted production. At present, the first application of panicle fertilizer has basically ended in various areas, with an average application of 20 to 30 dan of watery manure per mu, and the second application of panicle fertilizer is in full swing. In Liuzhou Special Zone, after the application of panicle fertilizer to 1.46 million mu of late rice, more than 80% have headed and flowered, and can safely avoid the Cold Dew wind. In Yulin Special Zone, where diseases and insect pests are more common, more than 230,000 people are mobilized every day to eliminate various diseases and insect pests, and more than 400,000 mu of affected late rice has been treated once or twice, achieving great results. Farmers in Wuzhou Special Zone are adopting methods such as reasonable irrigation and pulling ropes in the fields to prevent lodging of rice seedlings by all means. Many Zhuang and Han commune members reflect that this year's late-season crop field management started early, ended well, and has been consistently unremitting. The growth of rice seedlings is balanced and uniform. Judging from the current situation, the unit area yield of late rice is guaranteed to exceed that of early rice, and some can even catch up with medium rice, breaking past production records.

　　千军万马齐下田  降龙伏虎保丰产
    广东广西力争晚造增产
    据新华社广州12日电　广东省三千五百万亩晚稻大丰收在望，全省农民掀起了以防旱抗旱为主的保收运动，决心打好最后一仗，确保丰收。
    今年广东省的晚稻，经过两个多月来细心的田间管理，特别是经过反右倾、鼓干劲，大战落后禾之后，绝大部分稻禾都上升为一二类禾，长得又整齐，又茁壮，穗数又多，比大丰收的去年还要好。现在距离收割大忙只有二十天了，数百万亩快速种已经黄熟，谷粒长得又多又实。各地农民反映，按禾苗长势估计，如无灾害，每亩将比去年晚稻增产几十斤到百把斤。
    尽管晚稻即将收割，但收成并未完全定局。近来广东天气干旱无雨，各地都出现了不同程度的旱象，已有两百多万亩禾苗受旱；有些地区则受到“寒露”风和虫、鼠、兽害等威胁。广东省各级党委立即采取紧急措施，动员群众掀起以防旱抗旱为主的保收运动。佛山、江门、韶关、汕头四个专区，最近每天有六十多万人使用着十多万部水车、水戽和抽水机，日夜不停地车水灌溉；或者开引水渠，引山塘和水库的水进行灌溉。花县各人民公社三万五千多抗旱大军，在公社党委书记、委员和大队总支书记等干部二千多人带动下，日夜苦战，两天内就车水灌溉了五万四千多亩田，占全部受旱面积九成以上。全省绝大部分受旱的稻田也都灌溉一次以上。最近西北风多，水的蒸发量大，又是稻粒灌浆正需水分的时候，水的消耗量也比平时多，这就加重了抗旱任务。但是广大农民干劲很足，他们决心战胜旱象，夺取丰收。
    广东省发现虫、鼠和“寒露”风为害的地区，也立即组织了除虫、灭鼠和抗寒运动。佛山专区虫害鼠害比较严重的番禺、三水、增城、从化等县，每天都出动几万人突击除虫、灭鼠。各公社都由干部带头，划片包干，采取药杀和捕杀并进，全面围剿的办法，很快就基本消灭了虫害，捕杀了老鼠六百多万只。
    据新华社南宁12日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，广西各地深入地反右倾，不断地鼓干劲，农村超包产竞赛运动步步高涨，晚稻及旱田作物后期田间管理节节深入。目前，全区一千一百多万亩晚稻已经高达三尺以上，普遍含胎抽穗，近千万亩杂粮和油料作物陆续扬花结实，到处呈现一片丰收景象。各地人民公社根据干部和群众的思想动向，反复围绕“要小丰收，中丰收，还是要大丰收？”、“增产是否定局？”、“丰收能不能坐待？”等问题，展开大鸣大放大辩论，批判了麻痹自满情绪，进一步解放思想，广大干部和社员精神抖擞，后期田间管理搞得有声有色。仅9月下旬至10月上旬不到二十天，各地新积的肥料就由原来的八亿多担增加到十七亿多担；吃在田头、住在田头的“野战军”和突击队员由近百万人增加到一百五十万人左右。南宁、梧州、柳州、桂林等四个专区下放到生产队担任基层领导工作的干部，由七万多名增加到十一万二千六百多名，在他们的具体帮助下，大多数落后生产队跃入了先进行列。这个新的极为有利的形势，大大推动了生产。目前，各地第一次泼禾胎肥已经基本结束，平均每亩施放水粪二十至三十担，第二次泼禾胎肥正在热火朝天地进行。柳州专区一百四十六万亩晚稻经过泼禾胎肥后，80％以上已抽穗扬花，可以安全躲过寒露风。病虫害较多的玉林专区，现在每天出动二十三万多人消灭各种病虫害，四十多万亩受害晚稻已除治一遍到两遍，取得了巨大成绩。梧州专区农民正采用合理灌溉和田间拉绳等办法，千方百计防止禾苗倒伏。许多僮族和汉族社员反映：今年晚造作物的田间管理，开头早，结尾好，始终坚持不懈，禾苗生长情况平衡、整齐，从目前情况看，晚稻的单位面积产量，有把握超过早稻，部分的还能赶上中稻，突破过去的生产纪录。
