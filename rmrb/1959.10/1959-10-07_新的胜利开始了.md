    A New Victory Begins
    By Our Correspondent in Tianjin

    The morning glow holds up a red sun, scattering golden light on the Hai River. Festive red flags flutter in the breeze above the thousands of factories on both banks. Tianjin workers, who have made brilliant achievements in the first great decade of the motherland, are welcoming the dawn again, stepping into the second even greater decade with heroic spirit.

    Climbing to the Highest Peak in History

    As the department store and Haihe Square launched gorgeous and brilliant fireworks, and people in festive costumes were celebrating the great achievements of the past decade, the open-hearth furnace of the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant was blazing, and steel flowers were flashing. The steelmaking workers who persisted in production released high-quality, high-yield large "fireworks."

    At 0:00 on the 1st, the Lu Liang group on the night shift of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace arrived early, while the workers of the Chen Yiyou group, who were supposed to get off work, lingered. In order to shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel to within five hours, the two groups of workers worked side by side.

    Acting as the furnace chief was Yan Yongfa, a steelmaking worker who had been in the factory for nearly ten years. This experienced worker, who could judge the temperature and chemical composition of molten steel from the sparks, carefully directed the operation. Based on the recent high phosphorus content of pig iron, he creatively adopted the "three-step dephosphorization method" of adding iron oxide during charging, slagging, and refining. They finally created a new historical record with a four-hour-and-fifty-five-minute smelting time for a furnace of double-groove steel, firing the first shot of a good start.

    The gongs and drums celebrating this new achievement had just faded away when good news came from the No. 1 open-hearth furnace: the Qi Zisheng group, known for its high yield and high quality, produced the second furnace of steel forty-seven minutes ahead of schedule.

    The "logistics" sections were also in intense battle. The workers at the iron-smelting furnace promptly supplied the open-hearth furnace with sufficient molten iron, the workers at the gas furnace supplied gas with high calorific value, and the laboratory reported the test results of each steel sample in a timely and accurate manner.

    Early in the morning of the 5th, Zhang Jinming, an economic accountant in the steelmaking department, skillfully cranked out the results of these days of hard work with a computer: from the 1st to the 4th, the plant averaged 521 tons of steel per day, exceeding the output plan by 1.29%; the average daily output level increased by 122% compared with the first quarter of this year, 28% compared with the second quarter, and 26.65% compared with the third quarter, climbing to the highest peak in daily output in the twenty-plus years since the plant was built.

    Repair Workers Skillfully Revive Machines

    On the first day of work after the holiday, the workers of the Tianjin Tractor Factory all felt that the machines were more obedient than before. The twelve-foot lathe, known as the "old sick man" of the factory, used to require three fine turning operations, but now only one is needed. Various electrical equipment has been completely renewed, and even the three hundred-plus high-voltage porcelain insulators on the factory's utility poles are sparkling clean in the sunlight. The ingenious repair workers have prepared excellent weapons for the entire factory to fight a great battle in the fourth quarter during the five-day holiday.

    Before the rush repair started, everyone calculated the accounts. This repair work was characterized by large tasks, high requirements, few people, and tight deadlines. However, none of the one hundred and fifty-plus employees who participated in the holiday rush repair complained or mentioned difficulties. They proposed a guarantee: not to let a single machine work "sick" in the fourth quarter.

    When the production workers were happily celebrating National Day, the battle of rush repair unfolded in every corner of the factory. Technicians and some workers focused their attention on the spot, surveying and mapping various machine parts. Fitters gripped their scrapers tightly and vigorously repaired the bed surface, unwilling to rest for even a minute. On the 2nd, the autumn wind urged the autumn rain, and it was raining intermittently. On the towering high-voltage utility poles in the factory, all the workers of the power section's external line team were still washing the high-voltage porcelain insulators in the high altitude. People sent raincoats to the base of the utility poles, but no one wanted to come down to put them on.

    The factory's only one-meter vertical lathe has more than seven hundred kinds of more than three thousand parts. The quality requirement for the repair is: under the vertical condition of five hundred millimeters, up and down cutting, no more than two deviations are allowed, and in a one-meter-long parallelism, there can only be four deviations. However, none of the workers had ever disassembled or unloaded this equipment in such a large scale, and the factory did not have drawings for this vertical lathe. The veteran worker Zhang Fusen, together with everyone, "drew gourds" of several of the most complex parts and their internal structure, creating small assembly drawings and solving this problem. They tried every means to repair this vertical lathe, which was originally planned to be repaired in seventeen days, eleven days ahead of schedule. The precision of the vertical cutting has restored the factory standard of the machine; the parallelism precision not only exceeded the quality requirements of the repair, but also exceeded the original precision of the machine.

    Five days later, all the repair tasks stipulated in the original plan were completed ahead of schedule, and the workers also inspected and rushed to repair planing machines, elevators, and clamping hammers beyond the plan. All the repaired machines, after the test of actual production, proved to have regained their youth.

    Everyone Red, Full House Red

    "Insist on the last minute before the holiday, and produce a full house red after the holiday." This is the wish of the thousands of employees of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory before the holiday.

    After the entire staff happily spent the National Day holiday, a new production began at 10 pm on the 3rd. On this day, the average attendance rate of the entire factory was 94.44%, and many workshops reached 100%, which was the highest attendance rate in the factory in recent years. On this day, everyone completed the plan, and the daily output of the entire factory exceeded the original plan by 14.44%.

    The ninety-eight workers in the B shift of the fine yarn workshop of the first branch came to the textile machines two hours before work to prepare for various productions. Each textile machine has four hundred and forty spindles and two hundred and twenty hooks. Usually, the fastest time to hook before starting the machine is fifteen minutes, plus other preparatory work, a total of half an hour is needed. On this day, the workers spent only ten minutes to test all sixty-plus textile machines. During the test run, the cotton suction device of the No. 6 machine failed, and the workers quickly repaired it. Although the machine was stopped for four days, due to the high morale and high spirits of all the workers, and the meticulous preparation work, the class produced 577 pounds of fine yarn more than the original plan, creating the highest record of collective production increase in this factory.

    Go All Out in a Great Leap Forward

    On the afternoon of the 5th, the Tianjin Paper Mill was filled with gongs, drums, and cheers. More than two thousand employees of the entire factory gathered in the factory's square to hold a conference to report good news to the Party. On the first day after the holiday, they achieved a good start with outstanding production achievements: pulp exceeded by 25.5%, and paper exceeded by 50.7%.

    Amidst thunderous applause, the workshops, sections, and groups sent one good news plaque after another to the rostrum. The workers in the maintenance workshop, who shortened the equipment maintenance time from three days to forty hours, preparing for a good start, first recommended their representatives to speak on stage. They not only completed the maintenance tasks ahead of schedule, but also implemented fifteen major measures to improve output quality. For example, they replaced the transmission large groove wheel for the No. 5 paper machine, increasing the speed from 157 meters per minute to 160 meters per minute, and the daily output increased by about 2% compared with before.

    After the representative of the large boiler group of the pulp workshop reported on the good news of completing the daily production plan of pulp with an excess of 25.5% on the stage, the representative of the paper workshop reported their production achievements to the employees of the entire factory. The party branch secretary, workshop director, trade union chairman, and workers who participated in the first shift production of the paper workshop all arrived at the workshop early on the first day after the holiday. The workers of the No. 3 paper machine took the "fast lead, fast scoring" operation method in response to the situation that there were many paper breaks as soon as the machine was started, making the daily output of paper exceed the plan by eight tons. The paper workshop exceeded 50.7% of the daily paper production plan, achieving a good start.

    Good news after good news, applause after applause... However, the employees of the entire factory were not satisfied. They made a new guarantee to the Party at the conference: determined to advance victoriously, achieve daily red, monthly red, and make great efforts in the fourth quarter, strive for a monthly output of 10,000 tons of pulp, and complete the annual production plan five days ahead of schedule.

    新的胜利开始了
    本报驻天津记者
    朝霞托出一轮红日，在海河上洒下万点金光。节日的红旗在两岸千百个工厂的上空迎风招展。在祖国第一个伟大的十年曾经立下辉煌战功的天津工人们，又迎着晨曦，怀着豪迈的心情，跨入了第二个更伟大的十年。
    攀上历年最高峰
    当百货大楼、海河广场发射出绚丽灿烂的焰火，穿着节日盛装的人们正在欢庆十年来伟大成就的时候，天津第一钢厂的马丁炉炉火熊熊，钢花闪闪。坚持生产的炼钢工人们放出了优质高产的大“礼花”。
    1日零点，二号平炉上夜班的卢良小组提前来了，该下班的陈益友小组的工人却迟迟不走。为了把每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短到五个小时以内，两组工人并肩作战。
    代理炉长职务的是进厂将近十年的炼钢工人阎永发。这个能从火花中判断出钢水温度和化学成分的老工人，小心翼翼地指挥操作。他根据最近生铁含磷量较高的具体情况，创造性地采用了在加料、放渣、化清的时候分别投入氧化铁的“三步脱磷法”。他们终于用四小时五十五分钟炼一炉双槽钢的成绩，创造了产量最高、熔炼时间最短的历史新纪录，打响了开门红的第一炮。
    祝贺这一新成就的锣鼓刚刚落音，一号平炉又传出了捷报：以高产优质著称的齐子升小组，比原计划提前四十七分钟炼出了第二炉钢。
    “后勤”各工段，战斗也很紧张。化铁炉上的工人及时供给平炉充足的铁水，煤气炉上的工人供给了发热效率很高的煤气，化验室及时、准确地报告了每个钢样的化验结果。
    5日凌晨，炼钢部的经济核算员张金铭用计算机熟练地摇出了这几天奋战的结果：1至4日，这个厂每天平均产钢五百二十一吨，超额1.29％完成了产量计划；平均日产水平比今年第一季度提高122％，比第二季度提高28％，比第三季度提高26.65％，攀上了建厂二十多年来日产量的最高峰。
    检修工巧施回春手
    节后开工的第一天，天津拖拉机制造厂的工人们都感到，机器比过去更听话了。那台全厂有名的“老病号”——十二呎车床，过去要精车三遍的活，现在只车一遍就行了。各种电气设备面貌都焕然一新，连厂里电线杆上的三百多个高压磁瓶都干净得在阳光下闪闪发亮。妙手回春的机修工人们，在五天的假日里，为全厂大战第四季度准备了精良的武器。
    抢修开始以前，大家算了下账，这次检修工作是任务大，要求高，人手少，时间紧。一百五十多个参加节日抢修的职工，却没有一个叫苦喊困难。他们提出保证：不让一台机器设备在第四季度“带病”工作。
    当生产工人正在欢度国庆佳节的时候，抢修的战斗在全厂各个角落展开了。技术人员和一部分工人聚精会神地在现场测绘各种机器零件。钳工们紧握刮刀用劲地修理床面，连一分钟都舍不得休息。2日那天，秋风催着秋雨，时大时小地下个不停。在厂内的高耸入云的高压电线杆上，动力工段外线组的全体工人仍在高空中擦洗高压磁瓶。人们把雨衣送到电线杆下，也没有人愿意下来穿。
    全厂仅有的那台一米立车，有七百多种三千多件零件，检修的质量要求是：在五百个米厘的垂直的条件下，上下吃刀，不许有二道的公差，在一米长的平行度上，也只能有四道公差。可是，工人们谁都没有大拆、大卸过这种设备，工厂又没有关于这台立车的图纸。老工人张富森和大家一起，把几个最复杂的部分和它的内部构造“照葫芦画瓢”地画下一张张小总成图纸，解决了这一问题。他们想尽办法，把原来计划在十七天内修好的这台立车，提前十一天修好了。垂直吃刀的精度，恢复了机器出厂时的标准；平行精度不仅超过了检修的质量要求，还超过了机器原来的精度。
    五天以后，原计划规定的全部检修任务都提前完成了，工人们还超计划检查和抢修了刨齿机、提升机、夹板锤等机器设备。所有修理过的机器，经过实际生产的考验，证明都恢复了青春。
    人人红　满堂红
    “节前坚持最后一分钟，节后生产满堂红。”这是国营天津第二棉纺织厂几千名职工在节前立下的心愿。
    全体职工欢欣愉快地度过国庆节以后，3日下午十时开始了新的生产。这一天，全厂职工平均出勤率94.44％，不少车间达到100％，是这个厂几年来出勤率最高的一天。这一天，每个人都完成了计划，全厂日产量比原计划超额14.44％。
    一分厂细纱车间乙班的九十八名工人，离上班时间还有两个小时，就全部来到纺织机旁，进行各项生产准备。每台纺织机有四百四十个锭子，二百二十个挂钩，平时开车前挂钩的时间最快也得十五分钟，加上其它准备工作，共需半小时。这一天，工人们只用十分钟，就把六十多台纺织机全部试车完毕。试车过程中，六号机的吸棉器发生了故障，工人们很快就把它修好了。尽管机器停了四天，由于全体工人斗志昂扬，意气风发，准备工作做得细致，一班就比原计划超额生产了五百七十七磅细纱，创造了这个厂集体增产的最高纪录。
    一鼓作气大跃进
    5日下午，天津造纸总厂锣鼓喧天，人声鼎沸。全厂两千多名职工聚集在厂里的广场上，举行向党报捷大会。他们在节后第一天以出色的生产成就实现了开门红：纸浆超额25.5％，纸张超额50.7％。
    在雷动的掌声中，各车间、工段、小组把一个个捷报牌送到主席台上。把设备检修时间由三天缩短到四十个小时，为开门红作好准备工作的维修车间的工人们，首先推举了自己的代表登台发言。他们不但提前完成了检修任务，还结合实施了十五项提高产量质量的重大措施。例如，他们给五号抄纸机更换了传动大槽轮，使车速由每分钟一百五十七米提高到一百六十米，日产量比以前提高2％左右。
    制浆车间大锅小组的代表登台报告了超额25.5％完成纸浆日产计划的喜讯以后，造纸车间的代表向全厂职工汇报了他们的生产成就。造纸车间的党支部书记、车间主任、工会主席和参加第一班生产的工人，节后第一天都提前来到车间。三号抄纸机的工人针对刚一开车纸张断头多的情况，采取“领头快、划边快”的“两快”操作方法，使纸张日产量超过计划八吨。造纸车间超额50.7％完成了纸张日产计划，实现了开门红。
    捷报接捷报，掌声连掌声……但是，全厂职工毫不满足。他们在大会上向党提出新的保证：决心乘胜前进，实现日日红，月月红，大干第四季度，争取月产万吨浆，提前五天完成全年的生产计划。
