　　Beating Two Sets of Drums Simultaneously
　　Li Fu

    The fourth quarter of this year is an extraordinary one: on the one hand, we must complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, and on the other hand, we must fully prepare for production in the first quarter of next year. Beating two sets of drums simultaneously makes it more lively and tense than in any previous year.

    I remember that the fourth quarters of the past few years were also lively and tense; however, in terms of the content of the tension, it is very different from this year. Many enterprises, in the fourth quarter, often could only rush to complete the production tasks accumulated from the current year, and simply could not take care of the preparatory work for the following year. As a result, they were in a rush in the second year, passive everywhere, and the production in the first month was far behind the level of the fourth quarter of the previous year.

    Low production level at the beginning of the year and high production level at the end of the year is seen as a "routine" by some people. In fact, this is not a "routine," but a reflection of a right-leaning conservative viewpoint. Right-leaning conservatism is a destructive thing for the general line and socialism. Right-leaning conservatives tout being content with the status quo, sticking to old ways, and doing everything slowly. It undermines the progress of the general line and socialist construction. Without opposing right-leaning conservatism, one can only live in the "routine." We communists are believers in continuous revolution, and we will never relax our subjective efforts in everything that can be achieved through hard work. The many astonishing creations since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have powerfully proved the correctness of this guiding ideology; this year, many factories and mines have entered 1960 at high speed, and many workers have done several years' worth of work in one year, which has more forcefully broken the "routine" of some people.

    The "routine" of low at the beginning of the year and high at the end of the year can be changed, the question is whether there is ambition and preparation. First, see if there is ideological preparation. The ideological preparation mentioned here mainly means to deepen and thoroughly implement the current anti-rightist rectification movement, and further arm the minds of the vast number of cadres and masses with the general line. If people's thoughts are right-leaning conservative, then they can only live in the "routine." If they break away from the shackles of right-leaning conservatism, hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, and bravely move forward, then they will continue to advance. Ideological preparation is the prerequisite for doing all work well; of course, in addition to ideological preparation, there must also be material and technical preparation. Political thought is the commander of the Great Leap Forward, and the reserves of materials and technical strength are the foundation of the Great Leap Forward. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee's grasp of arranging for next year as early as this year, and its emphasis on doing a good job in ideological preparation and material preparation is completely correct.

    Is it true that grasping this year and preparing for next year at the same time, beating two sets of drums simultaneously, will make the fourth quarter more tense and more chaotic? It will not. This year and next year are closely linked together. Making various preparations for next year's production this year is to lay the foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward in the coming year, arrange objective conditions well, and ensure that the ever-rising mass movement enters the new year even higher and more lasting!

    "Not burning incense at ordinary times, but embracing the Buddha's feet in times of emergency," is not our working method. An important working experience of ours is to grasp tightly from the beginning and grasp tightly from beginning to end. The beginning mentioned here does not mean waiting until this year comes before starting to prepare, but rather making arrangements early. The foresight of leadership work is also reflected here. We will never fight unprepared battles. In order to win a good start next year, we need to beat the drums of the Great Leap Forward even louder!

### 两套锣鼓一齐敲

　　两套锣鼓一齐敲
　　黎夫
    今年四季度是一个不平凡的季度：一方面要提前和超额完成今年生产计划，一方面要充分做好明年第一季度的生产准备，两套锣鼓一齐敲，这就比以往任何一年都来得热闹，来得紧张。
    记得过去几年的四季度也很热闹，也很紧张；但是，从紧张的内容看，同今年大不相同。有不少的企业，到了四季度往往只能突击当年积欠下来的生产任务，根本顾不上第二年的准备工作。结果，到了第二年手忙脚乱，处处被动，头一个月的生产大大落后于上年四季度水平。
    年初生产水平低，年底生产水平高，在某些人看来，这是一个“常规”。其实，这不是什么“常规”，而是一种右倾保守观点的反映。右倾保守，对于总路线和社会主义来说，是一种破坏性的东西，右倾保守主义者标榜安于现状，墨守陈规，一切事情慢慢来。它破坏总路线和社会主义建设事业的前进。不反对右倾保守，只好在“常规”里过日子。我们共产党人是不断革命论者，一切经过努力可以做到的事情，绝不放松主观努力。1958年大跃进以来的许多惊人的创造，有力地证明了这种指导思想的正确；今年，许多厂矿企业高速度进入1960年，许多工人一年干了几年的活，更有力地打破了某些人的“常规”。
    年初低，年底高的“常规”是可以改变的，问题在于有没有志气，有没有准备。首先看思想上有没有准备。这里所说的思想准备，主要是把当前反右倾的整风运动搞深搞透，进一步用总路线把广大干部和群众的思想武装起来。人们的思想，如果属于右倾保守，那就只好在“常规”里过日子，如果摆脱了右倾保守的绳索，高举不断革命的红旗，奋勇向前，那就会不断前进。思想准备是做好一切工作的前提；当然，除了思想准备以外，还必须有物质技术的准备。政治思想是大跃进的统帅，而物资、技术力量的储备，则是大跃进的基础。辽宁省委抓紧今年及早安排明年，强调做好思想准备和物资准备是完全正确的。
    既要抓紧今年又要准备明年，两套锣鼓一齐敲，会不会使第四季度更加紧张、更加忙乱呢？不会。今年和明年是紧密联在一起的，在今年就做好明年生产的各项准备，这是给来年的继续大跃进打下基础，安排好客观条件，保证不断高涨的群众运动进入新的年份更加高涨、持久！
    “平时不烧香，急时抱佛脚”，这不是我们的工作方法。我们的一条重要工作经验是一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧。这里所说的一开始不是说等到这一年来了，才着手准备，而是早作布置。领导工作的预见性，也表现在这里。我们决不打无准备的仗，为了夺取明年开门红，需要把大跃进的锣鼓敲得更响！
