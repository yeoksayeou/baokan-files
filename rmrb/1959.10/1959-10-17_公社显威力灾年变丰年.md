People's Communes Show Their Power: Disaster Years Transformed into Years of Abundance
    Henan's Hundred-Day Fight Against Drought Yields a Large Increase in Autumn Crops Across Hundreds of Millions of Mu
    Nanchong Prefecture Overcomes the Worst Drought in Twenty Years, Increasing Intermediate Rice and Corn Production by More Than Ten Percent
    Qingfengdian Commune Transforms Low-Lying Land: 5,000 Mu of Multi-Eared Sorghum Yields Over 1,000 Jin Per Mu

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th: After nearly a hundred days of fighting drought, the people of Henan Province have achieved a comprehensive and large-scale bumper harvest of autumn crops on over 110 million mu of land. Early and late autumn grain crops have now been basically harvested, and sweet potatoes, cotton, peanuts, tobacco, and other crops are being harvested.

    This autumn, in Henan Province, whether it is high-yield crops or low-yield crops, areas that are consistently high-yielding or historically low-yielding, news of bumper harvests is constantly pouring in, and the atmosphere is one of jubilation. In Xin County, Xinyang Prefecture, where the drought was most severe, the people fought against the drought for seventy days and achieved a large bumper harvest of 220,000 mu of early autumn crops, with an average yield of 912 jin per mu, an increase of more than 20% over last year. In Guangshan County, 800,000 mu of rice yielded an average of over 600 jin per mu, an increase of 30% over last year. In Dancheng County, Kaifeng Prefecture, 130,000 mu of sorghum yielded an average of 337 jin per mu, setting a new record for large-scale sorghum harvests in the province. In Nanyang County, 170,000 mu of sesame yielded an average of 136 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% over last year. In Luanchuan County, located in the Funiu Mountains, after overcoming the drought, 30,000 mu of corn yielded an average of 958 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 40% over last year. According to preliminary estimates based on the harvest, the province's original autumn agricultural production increase plan will be overfulfilled.

    This autumn, Henan Province experienced a severe drought, more severe than the historically heavy drought of 1942. In 1942, fifty counties in the province were affected by drought, with an affected area of 50 million mu; this year, more than ninety counties were affected, with an area of nearly 100 million mu. This year, in July, August, and September, except for some areas, there was no significant rainfall, and the drought lasted for nearly a hundred days. The drought in 1942 brought a desolate scene of scorched earth, no vegetation, people selling their children, and families ruined. According to verifiable historical data, more than three million people in Henan Province lost their lives in the drought that year. But such a tragic history will never be repeated today. This year, as soon as the drought appeared, under the leadership of the Party and with the care and strong support of the Central Government, the people of the province launched a massive mass movement to combat drought and ensure a bumper harvest. More than 20 million farmers and one million cadres in the province participated in the fight against drought. The people's communes fully demonstrated their unparalleled superiority in the fight against drought. Various localities carried out large-scale labor, tool, and water source cooperation, adopting the method of large-scale corps operations, working together with one heart and one mind, and leaping forward together. The water conservancy projects built over the past few years have played a powerful role. The province utilized these water conservancy projects and water sources to irrigate autumn crops more than 260 million mu-times to combat the drought. At the same time, in the fight against drought, a new upsurge in water conservancy construction was launched, combining construction and utilization. According to statistics up to the beginning of October, the people of the province newly built and repaired 2,400 reservoirs and more than 600,000 large and small canals, completing more than 190 million cubic meters of earth and stone work and expanding the irrigated area by 21 million mu.

    Conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase is also an important reason for the bumper harvest of autumn crops in Henan Province this year. The vast majority of autumn crops in the province were deep-plowed and applied with base fertilizer, especially as the fight against drought entered the second stage, various localities launched a movement to increase the production of various crops, vigorously implementing measures to increase water, increase fertilizer, and improve management.

    The people of Henan Province cherish the fruits of the bumper harvest obtained through arduous struggle. People's communes in various localities have organized specialized autumn harvesting teams, harvesting, threshing, and gleaning at the same time.

    In the situation of a large autumn harvest, the people of the province are advancing victoriously, launching a new production upsurge of drought-resistant wheat planting. According to statistics up to October 13, the province has sown 54,670,000 mu of autumn-sown crops, completing 68.5% of the plan, of which the sowing of wheat has completed more than 70% of the plan.

    This newspaper Chengdu, 15th: Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, overcame the worst drought in twenty years, turning a disaster year into a year of abundance, and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn-ripening crops. All of the prefecture's 4.5 million mu of intermediate rice and 400,000 mu of early and mid-autumn corn have been harvested. After verification, the average yield of intermediate rice was 620 jin per mu, an increase of 18% over last year; the average yield of corn was 400 jin per mu, an increase of 17% over last year; as of the beginning of October, 700,000 mu of cotton had yielded 22.08 million jin of ginned cotton, already 4.08 million jin more than last year's total output, and another 30% of the cotton bolls will be harvested soon; in addition, a bumper harvest of more than 2 million mu of sweet potatoes is a certainty and will be collected successively in the coming weeks.

    Nanchong Prefecture experienced a severe drought lasting several months starting in late May this year, which was basically relieved by late August. More than 500 people's communes in the prefecture played a powerful role in the fight against drought. Under the unified allocation of the commune, the whole district has more than 3 million labor force and 130 pumping units, more than 60,000 water wheels, more than 100,000 water scoops, more than 1 million water buckets, invested in the anti-drought battle. With the combined measures of water and fertilizer, irrigation, topdressing, pest control, and disease prevention, the drought was finally overcome and the bumper harvest of crops was guaranteed.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: The 5,000 mu of high-yielding multi-eared sorghum in the Xijiazhuang Management District of the Qingfengdian People's Commune in Ding County, Hebei, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to actual measurement, the average yield per mu was 1,050 jin, an increase of more than four times compared with the yield of 200 jin per mu on this cultivated land last year.

    The soil characteristics of this 5,000-mu high-yield field are: the ground cracks without rain, and water does not seep in when it rains. Every year is a spring drought and autumn waterlogging. In order to completely change the face of this cultivated land, after the establishment of the commune last year, in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, the whole commune transferred more than 10,000 laborers, newly drilled 88 artesian springs, and increased the spring flow from one cubic meter per second to more than three cubic meters per second; It also dug a 25-kilometer-long canal to implement self-flowing irrigation. Subsequently, the commune party committee and the production teams consulted and divided the crop planting area according to the soil quality. This 5,000-mu low-lying land was designated as a high-stalk crop area, and it was decided to make it a multi-eared sorghum high-yield field, and a thousand-jin per mu leap forward target was set. This spring, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the commune, the production teams initiated cooperation, concentrated more than 4,000 laborers, and universally deep-plowed this high-yield field to one and a half feet, applying 150 loads of base fertilizer per mu. At the beginning of July, when sorghum was being bundled, a serious aphid infestation occurred. At that time, the commune immediately concentrated manpower and material resources, and fought for four days and four nights to eliminate all the pests. (Attached picture)

　　农业战线形势好奇迹多
　　公社显威力灾年变丰年
　　河南百天抗旱斗争换得亿亩秋季作物大增产
    南充专区战胜廿年来特大干旱中稻玉米增长一成多
　　清风店公社改造低洼地五千亩多穗高粱亩产超千斤
    据新华社郑州16日电　河南省人民经过近一百天的抗旱斗争，夺得了全省一亿一千多万亩秋季作物的全面大丰收。现在早秋、晚秋粮食作物已经基本收完，红薯、棉花、花生、烟叶等正在收获。
    今年秋季，河南省不论高产作物、低产作物，年年高产区或历来的低产区，到处都是频传丰收喜报，一片欢腾景象。干旱最严重的信阳专区新县人民，与旱灾搏斗了七十天，夺得了全县二十二万亩早秋作物平均亩产九百一十二斤、比去年增产二成以上的大丰收。光山县八十万亩水稻，平均亩产六百斤以上，比去年增产三成。开封专区郸城县十三万多亩高粱，平均亩产三百三十七斤，首创全省目前高粱大面积丰收纪录。南阳县十七万亩芝麻，平均亩产一百三十六斤，比去年增长四成多。位于伏牛山的栾川县，在战胜干旱以后，全县三万多亩玉米平均亩产九百五十八斤，比去年增产将近四成。根据已经收获的情况初步估计，全省原订的秋季农业增产计划都将超额完成。
    今年河南省秋季大旱，比历史上干旱最重的1942年还严重。1942年全省有五十个县受旱，受旱面积五千万亩；而今年有九十多县受旱，面积近一亿亩。今年7、8、9三个月，除部分地区外，没有落过一次透雨，干旱持续了近一百天。1942年那年旱灾，带来赤地千里，寸草不生，卖儿鬻女，家破人亡的凄惨景象。据可查的史料，那一年河南省有三百多万人在旱灾中丧失了生命。可是这样惨痛的历史，在今天决不会重演了。今年，旱象刚一露头，全省人民在党的领导下，在中央的关怀和大力支援下，开展了声势浩大的抗旱保丰收的群众运动。全省有两千多万农民、一百万干部投入了抗旱斗争。人民公社在抗旱中充分显示了无比的优越性。各地大搞劳力、工具、水源大协作，采取大兵团作战的方法，同心协力，共同跃进。几年来兴修的水利工程发挥了威力。全省利用这些水利工程和水源，抗旱浇秋二亿六千多万亩次。同时，在抗旱中还掀起了边兴修边使用的水利建设高潮。根据到10月上旬的统计，全省人民新修和整修的水库有两千四百座，大小渠道六十多万条，完成土石方一亿九千多万立方米，扩大灌溉面积两千一百万亩。
    认真贯彻执行农业增产“八字宪法”，也是河南省今年秋季作物大丰收的重要原因。全省秋季作物绝大部分都进行了深翻和施底肥，特别是在抗旱斗争进入第二阶段，各地开展了各种作物的超产运动，大搞增水、增肥、增管理措施。
    河南省人民十分珍视经过艰苦斗争夺得的丰收果实，各地人民公社组织秋收专业队伍，边收、边打、边拾。
    在秋季大丰收的形势下，全省人民乘胜前进，掀起了抗旱种麦的新的生产高潮。到10月13日统计，全省已经播种秋播作物五千四百六十七万亩，完成计划68.5％，其中播种小麦完成计划70％以上。
    本报成都15日电　四川省南充专区战胜二十年来未有的特大干旱，变灾年为丰年，取得了秋熟作物全面大丰收。全区四百五十多万亩中稻和四十多万亩早、中秋玉米已经全部收完。经过核实，中稻平均亩产六百二十斤，比去年增产一成八；玉米平均亩产四百斤，比去年增产一成七；七十万亩棉花到10月上旬为止，收得皮棉二千二百零八万斤，已比去年总产量多四百零八万斤，还有30％的棉桃将在最近采摘；此外，二百多万亩红苕丰收已成定局，将在下旬陆续收藏。
    南充专区今年从5月下旬开始，发生了持续几个月的严重旱象，到8月下旬才基本解除。全区五百多个人民公社在抗旱中发挥了强大威力。在公社统一调配下，全区共有三百多万个劳力和一百三十台抽水机、六万多部水车、十多万个戽水兜、一百多万担水桶，投入了抗旱战斗。在水肥并举、灌水、追肥、治虫、防病多种措施配合下，终于战胜了干旱，保证了作物丰收。
    据新华社天津16日电　河北定县清风店人民公社席家庄管理区五千亩多穗高粱丰产方空前丰收。据实打结果，平均亩产一千零五十斤，比去年这块耕地的亩产二百斤增长了四倍多。
    这五千亩丰产方的土质特点是：无雨地裂缝，有雨不渗汤。每年都是春旱、秋涝。为了彻底改变这片耕地的面貌，去年公社成立后，即按照等价交换的原则，全社抽调了一万多名劳动力，新打自流泉八十八个，泉水流量由一个秒立方米增加到三个多秒立方米；又挖了一条长达二十五公里的渠道，实行自流灌溉。接着公社党委和各生产队协商，按土质划分了作物种植区域。这五千亩地势较洼的地，被划为高秆作物区，决定搞成多穗高粱丰产方，并且制定了亩产千斤跃进指标。今年春天，在公社的统一领导和安排下，各生产队发起协作，集中四千多劳力，把这个丰产方普遍深翻到一尺半，每亩施底肥一百五十担。7月初，正是高粱打包的时候，又发生了严重的蚜虫。当时，公社立即集中人力物力，大战四天四夜，把虫害全部消灭。（附图片）
