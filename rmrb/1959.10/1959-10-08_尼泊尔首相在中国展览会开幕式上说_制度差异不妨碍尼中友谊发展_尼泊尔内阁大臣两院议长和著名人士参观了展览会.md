Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, October 6th. Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala said at the opening ceremony of the Chinese photo, art, and handicraft exhibition here this morning that China's experiments in national construction are great experiments, and Nepal can learn many beneficial things from them, thereby enhancing Sino-Nepalese friendship.

The Chinese exhibition, the first to be held in the Nepalese capital, was to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The exhibition displayed 300 pictures, works of art, and handicrafts about China's achievements in various aspects of construction.

Koirala also said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition that differences in political and social systems do not hinder the development of friendly relations between Nepal and China. Sino-Nepalese friendship proves this point. He hoped that this long-standing friendship will become increasingly strong.

He said that Nepal is carrying out national construction and is in the process of eliminating feudalism. He believes that the Chinese exhibition will inspire the Nepalese people to engage in their own national construction.

Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Pan Zili spoke first at the opening ceremony. He introduced the achievements China has made in the past ten years. He said, "We are very happy that the Nepalese people are also building their own country. In our respective construction work, there is much that we can learn from each other and help each other. Because of this, the development of friendly relations between our two countries has broad prospects."

Ambassador Pan Zili pointed out that the exchange of visits by delegations and cultural exchanges between the two countries in the past few years have greatly enhanced mutual understanding and friendly relations between the two countries.

About two hundred people attended the opening ceremony, including Nepalese cabinet ministers, speakers of the lower and upper houses of parliament, prominent figures from all walks of life, and the Soviet ambassador.

Prime Minister Koirala visited the exhibition in detail and asked about the development of Chinese industry and agriculture with great interest. He was particularly interested in small blast furnaces, water conservancy and irrigation, rice planting, textile factories, and paper mills. He wrote in the guestbook, "I am convinced that the people of Kathmandu will benefit from this exhibition."

The achievements of China's construction displayed at the exhibition were praised by the audience. Dan Ba. Singh, Speaker of the Upper House of the Nepalese Parliament, wrote in the guestbook, "I am deeply moved to learn that great China has made tremendous progress in a short period of time." Education Minister Chowdhury wrote, "We have seen how great China is advancing rapidly." Minister of Industry and Commerce Mishra said, "We can learn from China's experience to build our own country."

The exhibition will last for about ten days.

    参加开幕式的有两百人左右，其中有尼泊尔内阁大臣、下议院议长和上议院议长、各界著名人士，还有苏联大使。
    柯伊拉腊首相详细地参观了展览会，并且以极大的兴趣询问中国工农业的发展情况。他对小高炉、水利灌溉、种稻、纺织厂和造纸厂特别感到兴趣。他在留言簿上写道，“我深信，加德满都人民将从这个展览会里得到好处。”
