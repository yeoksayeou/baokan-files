Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th. Hubei, Shanxi Send Large Advance Forces to the Water Conservancy Front
　　After more than eighty days of heroic struggle, and overcoming the severe drought unseen in seventy years, the people of Hubei Province, under the great call and encouragement of the Party’s anti-rightist and all-out effort campaign, are launching a water conservancy construction movement even larger in scale than that of 1958.
　　As early as July and September of this year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made detailed arrangements for water conservancy work this winter and next spring, deciding to focus on continuing construction and expansion, supplemented by new construction, implementing the policy of "water storage as the main focus, small-scale as the main focus, and commune-run as the main focus," and appropriately increasing a number of large and medium-sized projects to achieve a combination of large, medium, and small projects, forming a complete water conservancy system of interconnected reservoirs and ponds, and interconnected ditches and rivers over a large area. According to the above policy, this winter and next spring the province will continue, expand, and newly build 395 large and medium-sized reservoirs with a benefited area of ​​more than 10,000 mu, and more than 500,000 small-scale projects with a benefited area of less than 10,000 mu. After the completion of these projects, the province's guaranteed harvest area of ​​farmland will increase from 30 million mu to more than 40 million mu, of which more than 80% can be irrigated by gravity flow; more than a dozen medium-sized rivers will be fundamentally controlled, and hydropower generating capacity can be increased by 300,000 kilowatts, and cultivated land area can be increased by 2 million mu.
　　In order to realize this grand plan, the masses of farmers throughout the province, under the slogan of "early preparation, early construction, early completion, and early benefit," while vigorously carrying out autumn harvest and winter planting, dispatched advance forces of 500,000 people to key construction sites to build work sheds, construct roads, and rush to plant vegetables, to make full preparations for the comprehensive start of work in early November. More than 160 new construction and expansion projects have started one after another, among which the large-scale Zhanghe, Fushui, Lushui, and Weishui and other ten large-scale water conservancy hub projects are about to enter a construction climax.
　　The prominent characteristics of this year's water conservancy construction movement in Hubei Province are its strong momentum, great scale, and strong leadership determination. Xiangyang Special District, famous for creating the watermelon vine-style water conservancy system, plans to build 50 projects with a benefited area of ​​more than 10,000 mu this year, of which 37 have already started, 12 more than the same period last year, and more than 100,000 laborers have started work, more than 50% more than the same period last year. Jingzhou Special District has basically completed the design of large and medium-sized culverts, and 20 have already started, with more than 140,000 people working every day, and people's communes in some areas have launched a climax of river network construction. Huanggang Special District has determined to simultaneously control mountains, rivers, and lakes this winter and next spring. In addition to the ongoing construction of projects that have been started one after another, large-scale projects such as Gaomiao and Jinsha River have been added, and it is determined that 75% of the farmland in eastern Hubei will be basically guaranteed a harvest next year. Xiaogan Special District originally did not plan to carry out the Fuhuai and Huanshui (larger rivers in central Hubei) river diversion projects, but after opposing right-leaning and encouraging all-out effort, it was decided to invest 150,000 laborers in this huge project.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th. The farmland capital construction movement centered on water conservancy construction has been launched one after another in rural areas of Shanxi Province.
　　At present, more than half of the province's autumn harvest area has been completed, and autumn cultivated land has exceeded 10 million mu. Due to the unified planning of production and reasonable arrangement of labor by people's communes in various places, this year, while ensuring the progress of the three autumn tasks, the prelude to water conservancy construction was opened a month earlier than in previous years. After the deployment of troops in various places, 360,000 advance teams in the province have been put into water conservancy construction. In Jinbei Special District, where the climate is cold and freezing early, in order to ensure the complete completion of all agricultural capital construction tasks, as early as summer and autumn, there were 50,000 laborers in the entire special district specializing in water conservancy construction. As the autumn harvest work approaches completion, the water conservancy construction team will soon expand to 200,000 people, accounting for 20% of the total number of laborers in the special district. Jin Southeast, Jinnan, and Jinzhong areas have recently held meetings, universally established institutions, strengthened leadership, arranged projects, and transferred personnel from all aspects to the water conservancy front. Encouraged by the excellent rural situation, the water conservancy construction army in various places is high in morale and full of energy. Before the construction of the Lv Zhuang Reservoir in Wenxi County, mass meetings were held in all people's communes in the county, reporting on the great significance of jointly building this project, and everyone competed to sign up to participate.
　　This year's water conservancy movement is characterized by early start, rapid development, large scale, and good order, which fully demonstrates the great superiority of the people's communes. In addition to the widespread development of various small-scale water conservancy projects by communes, management areas, and production teams according to local conditions, 24 large and medium-sized projects jointly built by communes or communes and communes (with certain assistance from the state) have also emerged. These projects generally have a dam height of more than 25 meters and a reservoir capacity of more than 10 million cubic meters. The Yukou Reservoir in Wenshui County has a dam height of 61 meters and a reservoir capacity of 140 million cubic meters. These projects are large projects that have been long-awaited by local farmers to tame floods and develop water conservancy, and were beyond the reach of any period before communization. People's communes have a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities, not only undertaking these large projects, but also all large and medium-sized projects are proposed on the basis of river basin planning, with reasonable layout, adapted to the systematization of projects, accurate water accounts, relatively detailed geological exploration, and design work that can keep up, while embodying the spirit of achieving increased grain and cotton production. In particular, people's communes have a huge guarantee for investment and labor, which also ensures the normal progress of the project. Among the 24 large and medium-sized projects, 18 have officially started construction.

　　早准备　早施工　早受益
    湖北  山西大批先头部队开上水利战线
    据新华社武汉16日电　经过八十多天英勇奋战，战胜了七十年来未有的严重旱灾的湖北省人民，在党的反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召和鼓舞下，正在展开一个比1958年规模更大的水利建设运动。
    早在今年7月和9月间，中共湖北省委就对今冬明春水利工作进行了细致的安排，决定以续建扩建为主，新建为辅，贯彻“蓄水为主，小型为主，社办为主”的方针，并且适当增加一批大中型工程，做到大中小相结合，在大面积内形成库塘相连，沟河相通的完整水利系统。根据上述方针，今冬明春全省将要续建扩建新建受益面积达万亩以上的大中型水库三百九十五处，万亩以下小型工程五十多万处。这些工程完成以后，将使全省农田保收面积由三千万亩增加到四千万亩以上，其中80％以上可以自流灌溉；使十多条中等河流得到根本治理，还可以增加水力发电装机容量三十万瓩，增加耕地面积二百万亩。
    为了实现这个宏伟的计划，全省农民群众在“早准备，早施工，早完工，早受益”的口号下，在大搞秋收冬播的同时，就派出五十万人的先遣部队到重点工地搭盖工棚，修筑道路和抢种蔬菜，为11月初全面开工做好充分准备。有一百六十多项新建、续建工程已经先后开工，其中规模巨大的漳河、富水、陆水、危水等十处大型水利枢纽工程，即将进入施工高潮。
    今年湖北省水利建设运动的显著特点，是来势猛，声势大，领导决心强。以创造西瓜秧式水利系统著名的襄阳专区，今年计划兴修受益面积万亩以上工程五十处，目前已动工三十七处，比去年同期多十二处，已上工的劳动力有十多万人，比去年同期多50％以上。荆州专区计划兴修的大中型涵闸的设计已经基本完成，有二十处已经动工，每天上工十四万多人，部分地区的人民公社已经掀起河网化施工高潮。黄冈专区确定今冬明春治山、治河、治湖同时并举，除续建工程已陆续开工外，并增加了高庙、金沙河等大型工程，决心明年使鄂东地区75％的农田能够基本保收。孝感专区原来不打算搞府河、环水（是鄂中地区较大河流）改道工程，经过反右倾、鼓干劲以后，决定以十五万劳动力投入这项巨大的工程。
    据新华社太原16日电　山西省农村以兴修水利为中心的农田基本建设运动陆续展开。
    目前全省秋收面积已经过半，秋耕地已突破一千万亩。由于各地人民公社统一筹划生产、合理安排劳力，今年在保证三秋工作进行的同时，比往年提前一个月揭开了兴修水利的序幕。经过各地调兵遣将，全省已有三十六万先头队伍投入了水利建设。气候寒冷封冻早的晋北专区，为保证全部农业基本建设任务圆满完成，夏、秋季以来全专区就有五万劳力专搞水利建设，随着秋收工作的接近结束，水利建设的队伍很快扩大到二十万人，占到了全专区劳力总数的20％。晋东南、晋南和晋中地区最近都召开会议，普遍建立机构，加强领导，安排工程，从各方面往水利战线上抽调人马。在大好的农村形势鼓舞下，各地水利建设大军斗志昂扬，干劲十足。闻喜县在开工兴建吕庄大水库之前，全县人民公社都召开了群众大会，报告了联合兴建这一工程的重大意义，人人争先报名参加。
    今年水利运动开展早，发展快，规模大，秩序好，充分显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。各地除了公社、管理区和生产队广泛地因地制宜地发展各种各样小型水利以外，还出现了公社或公社与公社联合兴建（国家给一定的帮助）的大中型工程二十四处。这些工程一般坝高在二十五米以上，库容在一千万立方米以上。文水县峪口水库，坝高六十一米，库容一点四亿立方米。这些工程都是驯伏洪患开发水利，当地农民向往已久，公社化以前任何时期力所难及的大工程。人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，不仅承担了这些大工程，而且所有大中型工程都是在流域规划基础上提出的，布局上合理，与工程系统化相适应，水账算得精确，地质钻探比较细致，设计工作赶得上，同时体现了实现粮棉增产的精神。特别是人民公社对投资投工有着巨大保证，从而也保证了工程正常进行。二十四项大中型工程中，目前已有十八项正式开工。
