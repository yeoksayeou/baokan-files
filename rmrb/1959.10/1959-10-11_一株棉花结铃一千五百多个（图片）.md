　　A Cotton Plant Bearing Over 1,500 Cotton Bolls

    Shulu County, Hebei Province, has cultivated a "Cotton King" that resembles a tree. This "Cotton King" is eleven chi (Chinese feet) tall, with fruit branches that are ten chi and five cun (Chinese inches) long. It has five hundred and twenty-five fruit branches, sub-fruit branches, and regenerated fruit branches, with one thousand five hundred and sixty cotton bolls and seven hundred and thirty flower buds waiting to bloom. Out of the one thousand five hundred and sixty cotton bolls, one thousand and forty-two have already yielded snow-white cotton.

    This cotton plant is now on display in the Crop Room of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall.
