Advocating the Spirit of "Don't Leave Things Overnight"
Chongqing Long-Distance Line Center Station Zhang Fengxiang

Here’s what happened at our station: To ensure smooth and high-quality communication during the National Day celebrations, the entire station conducted a thorough inspection of all telephone lines scattered across fields and valleys. A Communist Party member responsible for maintaining the Chongqing-Lijiatuo line helped the neighboring section by transporting telephone poles to Qijiang. By the time he returned, it was already night. However, without resting, he immediately climbed the telephone poles and carried out repairs under the moonlight. After working through the night, he finally completed the workload that should have been done that day.

This "don't leave things overnight" spirit was commended by the Party Committee. However, some comrades said, "Why bother staying up all night to finish it on the same day? Couldn't we just make an extra effort to catch up the next day?" However, if today's work isn't finished, there will be new work tomorrow. Accumulating small debts every day will result in the failure to complete production targets and work tasks. Even if we can catch up on today's debts tomorrow, we shouldn't rely on tomorrow. We should strive to complete things on the same day as much as possible. Wouldn't tomorrow be better for completing production targets and work tasks?

Furthermore, pushing everything to tomorrow is also dangerous because there is a tomorrow after today, and a tomorrow after tomorrow. This will lead to a habit of procrastination and sluggishness. In the process of building socialism, we should have the spirit of going all out and striving for the top. We must race against time and compete for every ounce. A slight relaxation will lead to a disastrous decline that is difficult to reverse. Racing against time and not leaving things overnight are incompatible with procrastination and pushing things to tomorrow. One goes forward, and the other retreats. Many facts have proven this point. Haven't many inventions been successful through countless experiments and continuous efforts day and night? He Xingfu, a pace-setter in technological innovation in the postal and telecommunications department, when creating the first long-distance automatic telephone switching circuit in the country, thought about the circuit day and night, whether he was eating, walking. He drew circuit diagrams with his feet when he walked and with chopsticks dipped in soup when he ate. Without this tenacious spirit, the long-distance automatic circuit trial would not have been successful between Chongqing and Chengdu.

Some comrades always like to postpone work until tomorrow, which is actually a manifestation of a lack of drive and an attitude of not actively striving for the top. If we treat production and work with a procrastinating and sluggish attitude, then we can't talk about completing targets and tasks, let alone exceeding and completing them ahead of schedule. Every comrade with a spirit of continuous revolution should produce and work by racing against time. In order to complete the 1959 production plan ahead of schedule and surpass our quotas, we must go all out and strictly prevent new ideas of slackening from arising. Let us remember this sentence: "Only exceeding quotas is allowed, no debts are allowed!"

    提倡“事不过夜”精神
    重庆长途线路中心站　　张凤祥
    在我们这里发生了这样一件事：为了保证国庆通信的畅通和质量良好，全站对所有分布在田野山谷的电话线进行一次检修。维护重庆到李家沱线路的一位党员同志，因为帮助邻段工作，运电杆到綦江去了一趟，回来已经是夜晚了，但是他歇也不歇，就马上爬上电杆，在月光下进行检修，经过整夜的奋战终于补上了当天应该完成的工作量。
    这种“事不过夜”的精神受到党委的表扬，但有个别同志却表示：“何必硬要熬夜当天搞呢？第二天努把力补上不就可以了！”然而，今天的事不搞完，明天还有新的工作，每天累欠一点，结果就不能完成生产指标和工作任务。即或明天能够补上今天的欠账，但我们也不应该把希望寄托在明天，而应该尽量争取当天完成，明天不是可以更好地完成生产指标和工作任务了吗？
    再说，啥事也推到明天来搞这也是危险的，因为今天之后有明天，明天之后还有明天，结果就会养成疲沓拖拉的作风。我们在建设社会主义过程中应该有鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，每一件事都必须分秒必争，斤两必争。因为稍一放松就会一泻千里，难以挽回。分秒必争、事不过夜与疲沓拖拉，推延明天是决不相容的，一个是向前，一个是后退。很多事实也证明了这一点。许多创造发明不是经过无数次实验，白天黑夜连续不断努力才成功的吗？邮电部门技术革新的标兵何兴福同志在创造全国第一条长途电话自动接续电路时，他不分白天黑夜，不分吃饭走路都在想着电路，他走路用脚踩电路图，他吃饭用筷子蘸汤画电路图。如果没有这种顽强的精神，那也就不会在重庆到成都之间试验成功长途电话自动电路了。
    有些同志总爱把工作推延到明天，这其实是缺乏干劲的表现，也是不积极争取上游的态度。如用疲沓拖拉的作风来对待生产和工作，那也就谈不上完成指标和任务，更不用说超额和提前完成了。每一个具有不断革命精神的同志都应该分秒必争地生产和工作。为提前和超额完成1959年的生产计划，我们要鼓足干劲，严防产生新的松劲思想。让我们记住这句话“只准超额完成，不许欠账”！
