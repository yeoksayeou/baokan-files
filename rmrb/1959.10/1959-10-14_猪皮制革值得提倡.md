Hog Skin Leather Making Deserves to be Promoted

In the Great Leap Forward of last year, China's leather industry also made great progress. The production of leather in 1958 increased by 1.43 million sheets compared with 1957, and leather shoes increased by 9.29 million pairs compared with 1957. In the first half of this year alone, leather shoes increased by 66% compared with the same period last year. With the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demand for leather products is increasing sharply. This requires the leather industry not only to rely on existing resources such as cowhide, sheepskin, and horsehide, but also to develop new leather resources. Among the new leather resources, hog skin is the most usable in large quantities. Therefore, vigorously stripping hog skin and utilizing hog skin has become an important new topic in the current leather-making industry.

The products of the leather industry mainly supply two aspects of needs: one is to make leather shoes, leather clothing, leather bags, leather suitcases, and other leather products; the other is industrial leather. This year, the quantity of leather needed in both aspects is increasing significantly. More and more people are wearing leather shoes and using leather bags, suitcases, and other leather products, so the demand for leather products is increasing day by day. In addition, a portion of leather and leather products are needed for export.

In terms of industrial leather, in recent years, the amount of leather loops, leather rollers, leather cots, and leather knots used in the textile industry alone has increased several times. This year, many new factories in the textile industry have been put into production. Adding five million spindles will require more than 400,000 square feet of leather loops and leather rollers per year; adding 10,000 looms will require more than 20,000 kilograms of leather cots and leather loops. Every two square meters of leather loops and leather rollers or every ten kilograms of leather cots and leather loops are equivalent to one cowhide. In total, every 10,000 spindles and every 10,000 looms require 3,000 cowhides. Adding the tire leather, oil seal leather, etc. used in other power equipment, automobiles, and airplanes, the quantity is considerable. These industrial leathers not only require large quantities but also have very high requirements for the quality of the raw hide.

The demand for leather is increasing year by year. If we only rely on cowhide resources, we cannot meet the needs. In addition to cowhide, we can also use mule, horse, donkey, sheep, and other miscellaneous hides. The quantity of these raw hides, except for sheepskin, is also very small. Although sheepskin is large in quantity, it is small in area and thin, so it can only be used to make light leather and not heavy leather. Moreover, six sheepskins are only equivalent to one cowhide, so its utilization is greatly limited. Relying on this part of miscellaneous hides can only meet a few percent of the needs. Only hog skin can greatly increase the raw materials for leather production. This is the leather industry's most abundant raw material resource. Some provinces in China, such as Shandong and Sichuan, have always had the habit of stripping hog skin. However, in other provinces, not many hog skins are stripped. If 20 million hog skins are stripped nationwide (accounting for about 20% of the slaughter volume), one-tenth of them can completely meet the needs of industrial leather.

Since December last year, after the Party Central Committee instructed all localities to pay attention to stripping hog skin and vigorously develop hog skin leather making, more than a dozen provinces, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Shanxi, have launched this business, in addition to the original Shandong, Sichuan, and other regions that have long had the habit of stripping hog skin. In the first half of this year, Henan Province stripped only more than 300,000 hog skins, which solved the province's need for industrial leather.

Some people think that stripping hog skin is labor-intensive and not as fast as dehairing, so they are not actively stripping hog skin. Changing from scalding and dehairing to skinning when slaughtering pigs is more labor-intensive at the beginning because the technology is not skilled. However, this can be improved. According to a typical survey in Chengdu, Sichuan, after the workers are skilled in skinning technology, using manual skinning, one person can skin one hog in only six or seven minutes, which is faster than scalding and dehairing. Since Zhang Deyuan, a skinning worker in Chengdu, Sichuan, invented the skinning machine, skinning one hog has been shortened from a few minutes to a few seconds.

Some people think that hog skin has coarse pores and softens when exposed to water, so leather made of hog skin will not be welcomed by consumers. Hog skin does have this shortcoming, but through the efforts of leather workers, this situation has long been changed. In particular, after the beautification of hog leather work was piloted in Shanghai, there was a new assessment of the use of hog skin leather making. The experience of the Shanghai pilot program proves that hog skin can not only completely change its original appearance and make beautiful coats, gloves, women's handbags, and leather shoes, but also replace cowhide to make various industrial leather products. As long as we continue to work hard to improve technology, the quality of hog skin products can completely catch up with cowhide products in the future.

At present, hog skin is sold together with the meat, causing great waste. On the tables of public canteens, we often see leftover hog skin. Many families also peel off the skin and throw it away after buying pork. If these hog skins are peeled off in advance, a lot of raw materials can be added to the leather industry. Of course, some people like to eat pork with the skin on, but this does not matter. If only 20% of the hog slaughter volume is skinned, there is still 80% to take care of consumers who are willing to eat pork with the skin on.

Massively using hog skin for leather making is a new task, and there are still many technical problems that need to be solved, such as how to store and transport the hog skin after it is stripped, where the skinning equipment comes from, the price of hog skin and pork, and how much the supply of skinned meat and meat with skin should be. The commercial departments should take the initiative to assist the relevant industrial departments in solving these problems. But it is certain that actively using hog skin for leather making will open up a broad source of raw materials for the leather industry and create more favorable conditions for the further development of the leather industry. This is a very meaningful task and should be greatly promoted.

### 猪皮制革值得提倡

　　猪皮制革值得提倡
    在去年的大跃进中，我国的皮革工业也有了很大的发展，1958年生产的皮革比1957年增加一百四十三万张，皮鞋比1957年增加九百二十九万双。今年上半年仅仅皮鞋一项就比去年同期增加66％。随着工农业生产的日益发展和人民生活水平的逐步提高，对皮革制品的需要还在急剧增加，这就要求皮革工业不仅依靠现有的牛皮、羊皮、马皮等资源，还必须开辟新的皮革资源。在新的皮革资源中，猪皮是最能大量利用的一种。因此大力开剥猪皮利用猪皮，就成为当前制革工业中一个重要的新课题。
    皮革工业的产品主要供应两方面的需要：一是做皮鞋、皮衣、皮包、皮箱和其他皮革制品；二是工业用革；今年这两方面需用皮革的数量都在大量增加，穿皮鞋和用皮包皮箱等皮革制品的人越来越多，因此皮革制品的需要量日益增加。此外还有一部分皮革和皮革制品供出口的需要。
    工业用革方面，近几年来，仅纺织工业用的皮圈、皮辊、皮仁、皮结等，就增加了好几倍。今年纺织工业又有许多新厂投入生产。增加五百万纱锭，一年就需要增添皮圈、皮辊革四十多万平方市尺；增加一万台织布机，就要增添皮仁、皮圈革二万多公斤；每两平方米皮圈皮辊革或每十公斤皮圈皮仁革，折合一张牛皮，总共每万纱锭和每万台织布机就需要三千张牛皮。加上其他动力设备、汽车、飞机所用的轮胎革、护油圈革等等，数量就相当大。这些工业用革不仅需要量大，并且对原皮质量的要求很高。
    皮革需要量在逐年增加，如果仅靠牛皮的资源，是不能满足需要的。除了牛皮，可以利用的还有骡马、驴、羊和其他杂皮，这些原料皮的数量除了羊皮外，也是极少的。羊皮虽然数量多，但面积小，皮薄，只能做轻革而不能做重革，而且六张羊皮才能抵得上一张牛皮，因此在利用上就要受到很大限制。依靠这一部分杂皮，也只能满足需要量的百分之几。只有猪皮能大量增加皮革生产的原料，这是皮革业最丰富的原料资源。我国有些省份，如山东、四川，历来就有剥猪皮的习惯。但是其他省份，把猪皮剥下来的还不多。全国如果剥取二千万张猪皮（约占屠宰量的20％），拿出十分之一就可以完全满足工业用革需要。
    从去年12月，党中央指示各地重视开剥猪皮和大力发展猪皮制革以后，除了原来的山东、四川等早有剥猪皮习惯的地区以外，黑龙江、辽宁、陕西、河南、江苏、贵州、云南、山西等十几个省，都开展了这项业务，河南省今年上半年只剥了三十多万张猪皮，就解决了全省工业用革的需要。
    有人认为剥猪皮费工，不如退毛快，因而不积极剥制猪皮。宰猪由烫退改为剥皮，开始因为技术不熟练，是比较费工的。但是，这是可以改进的。根据四川成都的典型调查，工人剥皮技术熟练后，用人工剥猪皮，一个人只要六七分钟就能剥一张，比烫退还快。自从四川成都市剥皮工人张德元发明了剥皮机以后，剥一张皮已经由几分钟缩短到几秒钟。
    有人认为猪皮毛孔粗，见水发软，猪皮制的皮革会不受消费者欢迎。猪皮确实有这种缺点，但是经过制革工人的努力，这个情况早已改变了。特别是美化猪革工作在上海进行试点以后，对猪皮制革的用途有了新的估价。上海试点的经验证明：猪皮不仅可以完全改变本样，做出花色美观的大衣、手套、女用提包和皮鞋等产品，而且还可以代替牛革做出各种工业用的革制品。只要我们继续努力改进技术，将来猪皮制品的质量完全可以赶上牛皮制品。
    目前猪皮随肉一同销售，造成很大浪费。在公共食堂的桌上，经常会看到吃剩下的猪皮，家庭买回猪肉，把皮剥下来扔掉的也很多。如果把这些猪皮事先剥下来，就可以给皮革工业增加很多原料。当然也有一部分人是喜欢吃带皮肉的，但这并无妨碍，如果只将生猪的屠宰量的20％剥皮，还有80％可以照顾愿吃带皮肉的消费者。
    大量利用猪皮制革，是一件新的工作，有很多技术上的问题还需要继续解决，如猪皮剥下来怎样保管和运输，剥皮设备从哪里来，猪皮和猪肉的价格问题，剥皮肉和带皮肉的供应量该是多少等等，商业部门应当主动协助有关工业部门解决。但可以肯定，积极利用猪皮制革，将为制革工业开辟一个广阔的原料来源，为制革工业的进一步发展创造更有利的条件。这是一项很有意义的工作，应当大大提倡。
