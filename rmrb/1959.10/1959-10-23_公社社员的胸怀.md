	The Broad Mind of Commune Members
	Su Yi

	During a stormy night, a mountain torrent erupted. Hundreds of male and female members of the Beiji Brigade of the Chengxiang Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, braved the rain to rescue crops. The dam of the reservoir was breached by the flood, and the commune members, while increasing the flood discharge channel, quickly ran to their homes and carried all the doors and floorboards to the reservoir. The wind was strong and the rain heavy, making it impossible to light torches. Some commune members fell, but they got up and carried the boards on their backs. ... Here, we see the shining socialist and collectivist ideology of the commune members. This is one of the most important signs of the rapid changes in the era.

	Last year’s Great Leap Forward and the surge of socialist ideology among the masses promoted the establishment of people's communes. The establishment of communes further liberated the productive forces and further changed the spiritual outlook of the people. The establishment of the large collective broke down the barriers between small collectives, and further broke down the ideological barriers created by private ownership and the individual economy. People's eyes are no longer focused on the dozens or hundreds of acres of land around their homes or villages, but expanded to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of acres of land in a commune. In this struggle to transform nature and society, people have also transformed themselves. People's horizons are becoming wider and wider. In August of this year, Chen County, Hunan Province, experienced a mountain flood unseen in decades. Hundreds of cubic meters of railway sleepers belonging to the Chengxiang Commune and the National Forestry Industry Bureau were washed away by the flood. Years ago, if the owner of the sleepers did not pay a salvage fee, few people would go into the water to salvage them. "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" was a social mentality unique to people in a small-scale peasant economy and private ownership society. Now that communes have been established, people's thinking is very different. Commune members living by the river thought: if they are not salvaged in time, the property of the state and the commune will suffer losses. Therefore, more than 380 commune members spontaneously organized a rescue team, jumped into the river to fight the flood, and rescued the timber. It can be seen that in the depths of people's minds, the fate of the commune and the country is tightly linked to their own fate.

	From "mine" and "yours" to "ours," this change has only occurred in the last few years in our country's rural areas. In the past, for thousands of years, people were bound by the rule of the exploiting classes and the shackles of private ownership, and the change in their spiritual outlook was very slow. The beautiful feelings of collectivism of millions of people were like small grass in a stone crevice, always suppressed. Now, only a little over a decade has passed since the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and only one year since the establishment of the commune, and people's collectivist ideological feelings have been greatly developed. This is one of the most valuable guarantees for building socialism and transitioning to a communist society in the future.

	Therefore, we emphasize putting politics in command, emphasize ideological work, and emphasize giving play to people's subjective initiative. We believe in the material strength and spiritual strength of the millions of people, and we must further arm the masses with the scientific truth of Marxism in the struggle. Right-leaning opportunists attack putting politics in command, in essence, they are attempting to corrupt the minds of the masses and cause them to lose their political direction. Whether or not to put politics in command is a question of whether or not to take the socialist road. Right-leaning opportunists oppose taking the socialist road, and of course, they also oppose putting politics in command. They judge the hearts of gentlemen with the minds of petty people, believing that nothing can be accomplished without "material incentives." Of course, the commune still adopts the principle of distribution according to labor at present, but this does not mean advocating that every matter should be meticulously calculated for material rewards, let alone that political and ideological work can be ignored or relaxed. This year, in many places, during the continuous months of fighting drought, fighting floods, and rescuing crops, and during the day and night of meticulous field management, the vast majority of commune members did not meticulously calculate how many work points this would get, or how many work points that would get. Under the leadership and education of the Party, they worked together, selflessly labored, carried out large-scale cooperation, and won a great harvest in a year of great disaster. This is precisely the great victory of putting politics in command, the great victory of the Party's leadership and socialist ideology. Right-leaning opportunists always look at things with the petty perspective of bourgeois individualism; how can they understand the great mind of commune members!

    公社社员的胸怀
    苏宜
    暴风雨的夜里，山洪暴发了。湖南郴县城厢公社碑记大队的几百名男女社员，冒雨抢救庄稼。水库大坝被洪水冲开，公社社员一面加大溢洪道，一面飞快跑到自己家里把门板、楼板全部搬到水库上来。风大雨大，点不亮火把，有的社员跌倒了，爬起来背着板子就走。……在这里，我们看到公社社员的社会主义和集体主义思想光芒四射。这是时代面貌在急速变化的最重要的标志之一。
    去年的大跃进和群众社会主义思想的高涨促进了人民公社的建立，公社的建立又进一步解放了生产力，进一步改变了人们的精神面貌。大集体的建立，打破了小集体之间的隔膜，更进一步打破了人们思想上被私有制和个体经济所造成的隔阂。人们的眼光，不再停留在自己家门口、村四周那几十、几百亩田地，而是扩大到一个公社的几万亩，十几万亩土地上了。在这改造自然、改造社会的斗争中，人们也就改造了自己。人们的眼界越来越宽阔了。今年8月，湖南郴县暴发了几十年所没有的山洪，城厢公社和国家森林工业局的几百立方米枕木木排被洪水冲散。在若干年前，如果枕木主人不出打捞费，是很少有人下水打捞的。“各人自扫门前雪”，这是小农经济和私有制的社会人们特有的社会心理。如今成立了公社，人们的思想就大不相同了。住在河边的公社社员就想到：如果不及时打捞上来，国家、公社的财产就要遭受损失。于是，三百八十多个社员自动组织了抢救组，跳下河去与洪水搏斗，救出木材。可以看出，在人们的思想深处，公社、国家的命运已紧紧地和自己的命运拧在一起。
  从“我的”“你的”到“我们的”，这个变化的发生，在我国农村里只不过是几年来的事情。过去，千百年来，人们束缚在剥削阶级的统治下，束缚在私有制度的桎梏里，精神面貌的变化是很慢的。千百万群众的集体主义的美好感情犹如石缝里的小草，总是受着压抑。如今，从互助合作运动开始发展到现在不过十几年，公社成立不过一年，人们的集体主义的思想感情就已经大大发扬起来了；这是建设社会主义和将来过渡到共产主义社会的最可贵的保证之一。
    因此，我们强调政治挂帅，强调思想工作，强调发挥人的主观能动性。我们相信千百万群众的物质力量和精神力量，并且要用马克思主义的科学真理在斗争中进一步武装群众。右倾机会主义者攻击政治挂帅，实质上就是企图腐蚀群众思想，使群众迷失政治方向。要不要政治挂帅，这是要不要社会主义道路的问题。右倾机会主义者反对走社会主义的道路，当然也就反对政治挂帅。他们以小人之心度君子之腹，认为没有“物质刺激”就什么事也办不成。当然，公社目前仍然采取按劳分配的原则，但这并不等于提倡对每件事都斤斤计较物质报酬，更不是说可以忽视或放松政治思想工作。今年许多地方在连续几个月的抗旱斗争中，在和洪水搏斗抢救庄稼时，在日日夜夜进行细致的田间管理时，绝大部分公社社员们并不斤斤计较这要得多少工分、那又得多少工分；在党的领导和教育下，他们齐心协力、忘我劳动，开展大协作，在大灾之年夺得了大丰收。这正是政治挂帅的伟大胜利，党的领导和社会主义思想的伟大胜利。右倾机会主义者总是用渺小的资产阶级个人主义的眼光看事情，哪能理解公社社员的伟大胸怀！
