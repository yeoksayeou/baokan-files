Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Today, the inauguration ceremony of the National Culture Palace was held. At the same time, a preview of the National Ten-Year Ethnic Work Exhibition opened here. Vice Premier of the State Council Ulanhu cut the ribbon at the inauguration ceremony.

This new building with ethnic characteristics, located on West Chang'an Avenue in Beijing, was decorated with joy today. Representatives of more than fifty ethnic groups from all over the country who came to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China came to the square in front of the Culture Palace to participate in the inauguration ceremony. Panchen Erdeni Choskyi Gyaltsen, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Vice Chairmen Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal Living Buddha and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who is also the Secretary-General, participated in the inauguration ceremony. Also participating in the inauguration ceremony were members of the Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing, representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations, figures from religious and cultural circles in the capital, and teachers and students from the Central Institute for Nationalities, totaling more than two thousand people.

At a little after 9:00 a.m., the inauguration ceremony and opening ceremony began amidst music and the sound of firecrackers. Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, delivered the opening speech, saying that the National Culture Palace was built under the deep concern of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council. It is a symbol of the unity, unification, development, and prosperity of all ethnic groups in our country, and a sign of the glorious victory of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies. He said that in the process of construction, the builders and engineering technicians of all ethnic groups worked with soaring enthusiasm, overcame various difficulties in winter construction, and completed the project, which would have taken three to five years in the past, within ten months. Like several large buildings recently completed in our capital, this magnificent and beautiful building itself is a product of the Great Leap Forward and a sign of the victory of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The construction of the National Culture Palace also vividly demonstrates the great unity and great collaboration of all ethnic groups and regions in our country, as well as the great communist spirit. During the construction of the National Culture Palace, enthusiastic support was received from relevant departments in Beijing and various regions across the country, especially several autonomous regions. As this building, which is of great significance to the cause of ethnic unity in our country, is completed, let us express our heartfelt thanks and sincere respect to the construction workers, engineering technicians, and all comrades of all regions and ethnic groups who supported this project, and to the people of all ethnic groups in our country, who are holding high the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

Vice Premier of the State Council Ulanhu spoke at the inauguration ceremony. He congratulated the completion of the National Culture Palace on behalf of the State Council. He said that it is a very meaningful thing to build a magnificent building in our family of fraternal cooperation among all ethnic groups, in the capital of our great motherland, to embody the great unity and leap-forward development of all ethnic groups in our country, and at the same time to serve as a place for cultural exchanges and other exchanges among the people of all ethnic groups. It is equally meaningful that the Ten-Year Ethnic Work Exhibition held here by the Nationalities Affairs Commission begins its preview at the same time as the completion of the National Culture Palace. As the whole country celebrates the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the concentrated display of the glorious achievements of our Party and the state in solving domestic ethnic issues since the founding of the country will undoubtedly have a major educational and inspiring effect on the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han delivered a speech on behalf of the six million people of the capital, warmly congratulating the completion of the National Culture Palace and the preview of the Ten-Year Ethnic Work Exhibition.

After Vice Premier Ulanhu cut the ribbon, the guests attending the inauguration ceremony began to visit.

The National Culture Palace consists of several parts, including a museum, a library, a cultural and recreational hall, and an auditorium. The museum includes five exhibition halls and thirty-five display rooms, with an area of more than 4,800 square meters. The library is a specialized ethnic library, now with a collection of more than 200,000 volumes, including books in nineteen minority languages. It also displays newspapers and periodicals in various ethnic languages and is now open to readers. The cultural and recreational hall has a gym, shooting room, table tennis room, billiard room, and rooms for practicing music and dance. The beautifully decorated and exquisitely equipped auditorium can accommodate more than 1,000 people and is equipped with an ultra-shortwave "interpreter wind" that can simultaneously translate seven languages. Panchen Erdeni Choskyi Gyaltsen, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, wrote an inscription for the Ten-Year Ethnic Work Exhibition after the visit, saying: "In the ten years since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the shining light of the ethnic policies, the backwardness of minority areas is being changed. This change enables the minority ethnic groups to enter the ranks of advanced ethnic groups. This is the grace of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and such grace is deeper than the grace of parents. I am willing to contribute all my strength to the construction of socialist and communist society."

    我国各民族团结、统一、发展和繁荣的象征
    民族文化宫举行落成典礼
    全国十年来民族工作展览的预展同时开幕
    新华社6日讯　今天，民族文化宫举行了落成典礼。全国十年来民族工作展览的预展同时在这里开幕。国务院副总理乌兰夫在落成典礼上剪了彩。
    座落在北京西长安街的这座具有民族风格的新建筑，今天打扮得喜气洋洋。来京参加建国十周年庆祝活动的全国五十多个民族的代表，今天来到文化宫大门前的广场上参加落成典礼。西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞和副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛、副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美参加了落成典礼。参加落成典礼的还有民族事务委员会和全国人民代表大会民族委员会在京委员，各民主党派和人民团体的代表，首都的宗教界、文化界人士，以及中央民族学院的师生等共两千多人。
    上午九时多，落成典礼和开幕式在乐曲和鞭炮声中开始。民族事务委员会副主任汪锋致开幕词说，民族文化宫是在党中央、毛主席和国务院的深切关怀下建成的，它是我国各民族团结、统一、发展、繁荣的象征，是中国共产党民族政策辉煌胜利的标志。他说，在施工过程中，各民族的建筑工人和工程技术人员，干劲冲天，克服了冬季施工的种种困难，在十个月的期间内，完成了过去需要三、五年才能完成的工程，和我们首都在最近落成的几个大建筑一样，这座宏伟美丽的建筑本身，就是大跃进的产物，就是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的胜利的标志。民族文化宫的兴建，还生动地表现了我国各民族各地区的大团结、大协作的伟大的共产主义风格。在民族文化宫施工期间，得到北京市有关部门以及全国各地区特别是几个自治区的热情支援。在这一座对我国民族团结事业具有重大意义的建筑落成的时候，让我们向高举党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜的建筑工人、工程技术人员和各地区各民族人民中所有支援这一工程的同志们，向我国各民族人民表示衷心的感谢和诚挚的敬意。
    国务院副总理乌兰夫在落成典礼上讲了话。他代表国务院祝贺民族文化宫的落成。他说，在我们各民族友爱合作的大家庭、我们伟大祖国的首都，兴建一座宏伟的建筑，来体现我国各民族的伟大团结和飞跃发展，同时作为各族人民进行文化交流和其它交往活动的场所，这是一件很有意义的事。在民族文化宫落成的同时，民族事务委员会在这里举办的十年来民族工作展览开始预展，这同样是一件很有意义的事。在举国欢庆我们伟大祖国建国十周年的时候，把我们党和国家建国以来在解决国内民族问题方面的光辉成就集中地展出，这无疑地将会对我国各民族人民发生重大的教育和鼓舞作用。
    北京市副市长吴晗代表首都六百万人民致词热烈祝贺民族文化宫的落成和十年来民族工作展览的预展。
    当乌兰夫副总理剪断彩绸以后，参加落成典礼的来宾们开始参观。
    民族文化宫由博物馆、图书馆、文娱馆、礼堂等几个部分组成，博物馆包括五个展览大厅和三十五个陈列室，面积达四千八百多平方米。图书馆是一个民族专业性的图书馆，现在藏书二十多万册，其中有十九种少数民族文字的书籍，还陈列有各种民族文字的报刊，今天已开始接待读者。文娱馆里设有健身房、射击室、乒乓球室、台球室，还有可供练习音乐与舞蹈的房间。装饰美观设备精致的礼堂可容一千多人，安设有能够同时翻译七种语言的超短波的“译意风”。西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞在参观后，为十年来民族工作展览题了词，题词说：“中华人民共和国建立十年来，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在民族政策的光辉照耀下，少数民族地区的落后面貌正在改变，这种变化使少数民族能够跻入先进民族的行列，这是共产党和毛主席的恩情，而这样的恩情比父母的恩情还深，我愿为建设社会主义和共产主义的社会贡献自己的全部力量。”
