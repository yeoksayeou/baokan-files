Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Korean farmers are currently engaged in a crash program to sow winter wheat. This year, Korean farmers are vigorously expanding the planting area of wheat and are implementing deep plowing, rational close planting, and increased fertilizer application during sowing, resulting in faster and better planting compared to previous years.

By October 5th, agricultural cooperatives in northern Korea had sown 47,000 chongbo of wheat. In North Pyongan Province, where the wheat planting area has increased by 50% compared to last year, agricultural cooperatives have already sown three times more winter wheat than in the same period last year. Agricultural cooperative members in Jagang Province, based on local climatic conditions, plan to sow ten times more winter wheat than last year.

The members of the Songam Agricultural Cooperative in Ryonggang County, South Pyongan Province, achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year by implementing the cultivation methods of deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilizer application proposed by the Korean Workers' Party. Currently, the members have organized shock brigades for sowing wheat, and since mid-September, braving the pouring autumn rain for twenty days, they have overfulfilled the wheat sowing plan.

　　深翻密植　多施肥料
    朝鲜冬小麦播得又快又好
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜农民正在突击播种冬小麦。今年朝鲜农民大力扩大小麦的播种面积，并在播种时实行深翻、合理密植和多施肥料，比往年播得又多又好。
    到10月5日为止，朝鲜北部各农业社已播下了四万七千町步小麦。小麦播种面积比去年增长50％的平安北道各农业社，到目前已播下了比去年同期多三倍的冬小麦。慈江道的农业社员们根据当地的气候条件，今年要播种等于去年十倍的冬小麦。
    平安南道龙岗郡城岩农业社的社员们由于实行了朝鲜劳动党提出的深耕、密植、多施肥的耕作法，今年的小麦获得了丰收。现在社员们组织了播种小麦的突击队，从9月中旬开始，以二十天的时间，冒着淋漓的秋雨，超额完成了小麦播种计划。
