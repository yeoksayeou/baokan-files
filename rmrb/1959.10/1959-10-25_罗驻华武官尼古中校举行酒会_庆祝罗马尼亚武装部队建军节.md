Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Romanian People's Republic Military Attaché to China, Lt. Col. Nicu, held a reception tonight to celebrate Romanian Armed Forces Day.

	Vice Minister of National Defense and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Luo Ruiqing, was invited to attend the reception. He extended warm congratulations to the close Romanian comrades on behalf of all officers and men of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the Romanian people are not only active fighters in building socialism, but also active fighters in defending world peace. They have repeatedly proposed holding a summit conference of Balkan countries to discuss the conclusion of a treaty of collective cooperation and security, in order to make the Balkans a region without nuclear weapons and rocket launch sites. Undoubtedly, this initiative is a positive contribution to European security and world peace, and we firmly support this peaceful initiative.

	General Luo Ruiqing said that although our two countries, China and Romania, are separated by vast distances from the Yellow Sea to the Black Sea, the common cause of building socialism has enabled the governments and peoples of our two countries to support and help each other. The friendship between our two armies has been further developed on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. We believe that this fraternal friendship will continue to develop and consolidate.

	Lt. Col. Nicu spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that on October 25, 1944, thanks to the heroic struggle of the glorious Soviet army and the heroic Romanian army, the entire land of our country was liberated from the shackles of fascist enslavers. Considering the importance of this day, the Romanian Workers' Party, the government, and the Presidium of the Great National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic decided to celebrate Romanian Armed Forces Day on October 25.

	Lt. Col. Nicu said that the soldiers, sergeants, and officers of our army express their determination to strengthen their military training in order to defend the peaceful labor of the working people of our country. They are ready to respond at any time to the call of the Romanian Workers' Party and our government to defend the beloved land of our motherland, and together with other fraternal armies led by the Soviet Union, to defend the security and territorial integrity of the socialist camp.

	Also invited to attend tonight's reception were Senior Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army including General Wang Shusheng, Senior General Zhang Zongxun, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Chen Bojun, Senior General Li Juikui, Air Force Senior General Liu Zhen, Navy Vice Admiral Luo Shunchu, and Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong.

    庆祝罗马尼亚武装部队建军节
    据新华社24日讯　罗马尼亚人民共和国驻华武官尼古中校今晚举行酒会庆祝罗马尼亚武装部队建军节。
    国防部副部长兼中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将应邀出席了酒会。他代表中国人民解放军全体官兵，向亲密的罗马尼亚战友们致以热烈的祝贺。他说，罗马尼亚人民是积极建设社会主义的战士，也是积极保卫世界和平的战士。他们一再倡议召开巴尔干各国首脑会议，商讨缔结集体合作和安全条约，以便使巴尔干成为一个没有核武器和火箭发射基地的地区。无疑地，这个倡议是对欧洲安全和世界和平的积极贡献，我们坚决支持这一和平的倡议。
    罗瑞卿大将说，我们中罗两国从地理上说虽然从黄海到黑海，道路相离是万里迢迢，但是在建设社会主义的共同事业中，却使我们两国政府和人民互相支持，互相帮助。在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，进一步发展了我们两国军队的友谊。我们相信，这种兄弟般的友谊将会继续发展和巩固。
    尼古中校在酒会开始时讲话。他说，1944年10月25日，由于光荣的苏联军队和英勇的罗马尼亚军队的英勇斗争，从法西斯奴役者的枷锁下解放了我们祖国的整个土地。考虑到这一日子的重要性，罗马尼亚工人党、政府和罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团决定，在10月25日这一天，庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国武装部队建军节。
    尼古中校说我们军队的士兵、军士和军官们表示决心为保卫我国劳动人民的和平劳动而加强他们的军事训练。他们准备着随时响应罗马尼亚工人党和我国政府的号召，保卫我们祖国可爱的土地，并且和以苏联为首的其它兄弟军队一起，保卫社会主义阵营的安全和领土完整。
    应邀出席今晚酒会的有王树声大将、张宗逊上将、傅钟上将、萧华上将、彭绍辉上将、陈伯钧上将、李聚奎上将、刘震空军上将、罗舜初海军中将、萧向荣中将等中国人民解放军高级将领。外交部副部长曾涌泉也出席了酒会。
