A brilliant decade has passed for our great motherland, with its infinitely powerful vitality.

The socialist revolution and socialist construction undertaken by our 650 million people under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are great undertakings unprecedented in Chinese history. This undertaking requires not only a thorough socialist economic revolution, changing capitalist and individual ownership of the means of production, but also a socialist political and ideological revolution, completely eliminating all viewpoints and habits that are not in line with socialism. Therefore, the issue of transforming people, educating people, and cultivating a new generation has been elevated to a new historical height. As we celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, it is a very meaningful thing to review the communist education of Chinese youth over the past decade.

Our Youth Grow Rapidly Along the Path Indicated by the Party

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party and Chairman Mao have used the principles of Marxism-Leninism on continuous revolution to put forward new tasks one after another, guiding our people to struggle unremittingly to achieve the great goal of socialism. In the past national democratic revolutionary struggle, the Party united millions of young people around it and cultivated them into strong revolutionary fighters. Due to the victory of the revolution in the whole country, and due to the needs of the ever-developing revolutionary situation, strengthening the education and cultivation of the entire young generation, guiding them to actively participate in the struggle for socialist revolution and construction, and cultivating them into strong fighters of socialism, this was not only possible but also became a very urgent task. To this end, the Party instructed us that we must vigorously strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of youth, and in terms of educational methods, taught us not to isolate youth's learning from the entire social life, but to closely integrate it with the struggle of the entire people to transform the old society and build a new society. Over the past decade, our youth have grown up along the path pointed out by the Party.

In the early days of the national liberation, the Party led the people of the whole country in the struggle to restore the national economy, in the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country, in the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as well as in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to repel the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie. During this period, the old influences of imperialism and feudalism left over from semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China still existed in large quantities. The Party taught us that these influences must be thoroughly eliminated before the victory of the revolution can be consolidated and developed. Our youth resolutely responded to the Party's call, actively participated in the above-mentioned movements, and in conjunction with each specific step of the movement, thoroughly criticized the ideological influence of pro-Americanism, worshiping America, and fearing America, greatly enhanced patriotism and internationalist political consciousness, distinguished the boundary between labor and exploitation, and clarified that they must stand firm on the working class's position, making spiritual preparations for carrying out the socialist revolution.

From 1953, the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, led the socialist transformation movement of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution in terms of ownership of the means of production. Then, the Party led the people of the whole country to completely defeat the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists and carried out the socialist revolution movement on the political and ideological fronts. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the Party also led the great people's commune movement in the vast rural areas. This series of new socialist revolutionary movements required people to further criticize the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and establish socialist and communist ideas that are in line with the socialist system. Our youth responded to the Party's call, actively participated in these movements, and accepted the education and exercise of the movements, raising their political consciousness to the level of socialist thought. In particular, the struggle against the bourgeois rightists was the most profound and vivid socialist education class for our youth. Under the leadership of the Party, our youth universally launched a great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism, carried out a sharp struggle against the bourgeois anti-Party and anti-socialist erroneous words and deeds, and further strengthened their will and determination to take the socialist road.

Experience has proven that revolutionary class struggle and revolutionary mass movements are the best schools for educating youth. The bourgeois educational viewpoints and doctrinaire arguments that separate education from practice have been refuted by the facts.

In the political and ideological education of young people, we have also fought against the following erroneous viewpoints:

One viewpoint says that young people are as pure as a blank sheet of paper, communist ideas can be generated spontaneously, and there is no need to conduct ideological education, ideological criticism, and transformation. Obviously, this view is very wrong. We have always acknowledged that young people are relatively pure and relatively easy to accept new things. However, young people are not as pure as a blank sheet of paper. In fact, young people come from different social strata, accept the influence of different social classes, and cannot but bear the imprint of different social class ideologies. Some young people from exploiting-class families often have more serious exploitative consciousness. The bourgeois world outlook, bourgeois political viewpoints, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois habits that exist in large numbers in society will inevitably continue to have some influence on young people. The bourgeoisie and its political influence will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Revolutionary ideas will not arise spontaneously. On the ideological front of young people, either the red flag of proletarian ideology is planted, or the white flag of bourgeois ideology is planted. There is no vacuum. Relaxing ideological education and transformation will inevitably lead to the proliferation of bourgeois ideology, which is not conducive to the healthy growth of young people and is not conducive to our cause.

Another point of view says that carrying out Marxist-Leninist education for young people hinders their free thought and independent thinking and restricts the development of young people's individuality. This is of course also very wrong. The essence of this view is to oppose the "promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology" policy on the ideological front under the guise of so-called freedom of thought, and to protect the ideological positions of the bourgeoisie. What is freedom? Freedom is not an abstract thing. Violating the interests and will of the broad masses of working people, so-called freedom is hypocritical, and in essence, it serves the bourgeoisie and the reactionaries. There is bourgeois freedom, and there is no proletarian freedom; there is proletarian freedom, and there is no bourgeois freedom. One eliminates the other, it can only be so, and there can be no compromise. From our Marxist view of freedom, freedom is the recognition of necessity. Marxism-Leninism is the most incisive weapon to help people understand and transform the world. Seriously studying Marxism-Leninism and thoroughly transforming thinking is not at all restricting people's freedom and individual development, not restricting so-called independent thinking, but precisely a great liberation of people's spirit and personality. It is precisely the invincible Marxism-Leninism that can help people open the window of wisdom, fully develop personality and talents for the greatest interests of the people and the progress of society, and finally make mankind leap to the "kingdom of freedom."

The Party and Chairman Mao taught us that in our country, there are still classes and class struggle, and class struggle has not ended. This struggle will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even fierce in the future. It's just that the form of struggle is different, sometimes it rises and sometimes it falls, sometimes it is high and sometimes it is low. The recent slanders and attacks by right-leaning opportunists on our country's Great Leap Forward, People's Communes, and the Party's general line are a reflection of this class struggle within our revolutionary ranks, and is a kind of bourgeois anti-socialist trend of thought. Since there is class struggle, and there is the influence of the bourgeoisie, we cannot relax or weaken political and ideological education for young people for even a moment. We must adhere to the Party's educational policy of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" to the end, continue to establish proletarian ideology in a big way, and destroy bourgeois ideology in a big way. And at present, we should resolutely fight against right-leaning opportunism, sweep away the slander and defamation of revolutionary mass movements by right-leaning opportunists, and eliminate the corrupting influence of right-leaning thoughts on young people. We must make all young people in our country understand that loyalty to the general line is loyalty to the Party and loyalty to socialism.

Youth Become a Shock Force in Socialist Construction

Due to the rapid increase in political consciousness of our youth, and the establishment of a political direction to struggle for socialism, they inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of diligence and bravery of our people, and under the leadership of the Party, became a shock force in socialist construction.

Hundreds of millions of young people enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to build the country with diligence and thrift and struggle hard, and with a fighting attitude, enthusiastically participated in the great struggle to restore the national economy and overfulfill the first five-year plan. At that time, there were hundreds of thousands of youth shock brigades, production teams (classes, groups), conservation teams, supervision posts, mountain construction teams, afforestation expedition teams, and other advanced youth collectives, fighting on various fronts of economic construction, and emerging from them were thousands upon thousands of advanced youth such as Hao Jianxiu, Wang Chonglun, and Xu Jianchun. Millions of young people rushed to the distant frontiers, and made contributions in the heroic labor of reclaiming wasteland, building roads, opening mines, and building factories.

In 1958, our country began to implement the second five-year plan. The Party formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The general line is the product of our Party and Chairman Mao combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the revolutionary practice of our people, and is the concentrated expression of the great determination and great wisdom of our people to change our country's "poor and blank" face as soon as possible. This general line further mobilized the socialist enthusiasm hidden in our youth. In the vigorous mass movement of socialist construction, the broad masses of young people were high-spirited, full of energy, and charged into battle in completing various arduous tasks, showing amazing perseverance. For the motherland, for the collective, for the Great Leap Forward, and for the People's Communes, they worked without preconditions, labored without counting rewards, went wherever the Party pointed, and appeared wherever there were difficulties. In the wave after wave of competition, the broad masses of young people launched a socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and learning from the advanced," with red flags everywhere and pacesetters in every field. The story of Wu Lianghu, a young worker at the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory in Wuhan, personally helping two backward groups to become advanced groups, had a very strong reaction among young people across the country. Many young people sacrificed everything for the interests of the country and the collective. The young female worker Xiang Xiuli and the young soldier An Yemin are noble examples of this kind of self-sacrifice.

We should regard the above-mentioned selfless spirit of heroic struggle for the interests of the country and the collective as a powerful factor of communism in the ideological field of our youth. This powerful communist factor is the most valuable spiritual wealth that grew out of the Great Leap Forward; it is a huge driving force for developing the mass movement of socialist construction; it is an important guarantee for implementing the general line of socialist construction. It is precisely this great communist spirit that fully reveals the great role of human subjective initiative, enabling people to create great miracles that were impossible in the past. Carrying forward this spirit has extremely far-reaching significance for accelerating our country's socialist construction and cultivating a new generation. What all imperialists and their running dogs fear most is precisely this spirit of our people and youth.

Some people close their eyes to the soaring communist spirit of our youth and the great achievements resulting from it, exaggerate the individual shortcomings of youth due to lack of experience, and pour cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses. This is an intolerable bourgeois master-like attitude. We revolutionaries are completely different from this bourgeois master-like attitude. In our view, first, under the correct leadership of the Party, the achievements of youth work are always the main thing, while the shortcomings are secondary, it is the relationship of nine fingers and one finger. We should look at the essence, look at the mainstream, and we should not only look at the shortcomings, be blinded by a leaf, attack one point without considering the rest. Second, these shortcomings are produced in the great advance. What is valuable is the advance. In the continued advance, any shortcomings are not difficult to overcome. Therefore, we should enthusiastically praise the communist spirit of young people, and enthusiastically support the revolutionary enthusiasm of young people.

There are also some people who believe that as long as material incentives are implemented, the enthusiasm of people to build socialism can be fully stimulated, and there is no need to strengthen political and ideological education and promote the communist spirit. This is also wrong. Of course, the socialist principle of "distribution according to work" must be implemented at the present stage. But relying solely on this principle is far from enough. Chairman Mao taught us that political work is the lifeblood of all economic work. People's communist ideas cannot grow spontaneously, but must rely on strengthening education. Only by combining political and ideological education for young people with material encouragement, and with politics as the commander and soul, can the principle of "distribution according to work" be correctly implemented, can the revolutionary drive of young people be sustained, and can young people finally and completely get rid of the influence of bourgeois egoism and vulgar low-level tastes.

Youth Should Be Both Red and Expert, Red While Expert, Red Thoroughly and Expertly Profound

In order to build our country into a strong socialist country, not only must we carry out political and economic revolutions, but also cultural and technological revolutions. We are faced with two kinds of struggles, namely class struggle and production struggle. Although class struggle will still be long-term, the task of production struggle is becoming increasingly great. Mastering advanced science and technology has become an even more particularly urgent task.

The development of our country's education has adopted the policy of walking on two legs. That is, in addition to running various types of regular schools, we also advocate various forms of mass-run schools and carry out a strong mass spare-time learning movement. By 1958, the proportion of illiterate youth in our country had dropped from 80% in the early days of liberation to 30%-40%. Last year, more than 50 million young people participated in Red Expert Schools and various spare-time schools. Spare-time learning has powerfully promoted technological revolution and production development. Facts have proved that this is the correct way to develop people's education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Any view that despises spare-time learning is very wrong and harmful.

Chairman Mao taught us that to build our country into a strong country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we must build a large contingent of intellectuals of our own working class, and it will not work if there are too few people. The Party calls on young people to be "both red and expert" people. Our Party puts the arduous and glorious task of mastering modern culture, science, and technology mainly on this generation of young people.

How to correctly treat the requirements of "both red and expert" is a matter of sharp ideological struggle among young people. In 1957, in conjunction with the struggle against the bourgeois rightists and the rectification movement, we criticized the bourgeois view of "expert first, then red," which is essentially "only expert, not red," and made young students understand the importance of putting politics in command. However, some young students also produced one-sided understandings such as "red first, then expert" and "red is difficult, expert is easy." In fact, "red" first, then "expert" is also not feasible. "Red" has no end. Waiting until one is thoroughly "red" before becoming "expert" is actually not becoming "expert." As for becoming "expert," it is not easy either. Today, our 650 million people are fighting to change the face of the motherland and declare war on the earth, which requires using modern culture, science, and technology as weapons. There is no reason to despise "expert." Our slogan is: both red and expert, red while expert, red thoroughly and expertly profound. Any argument that separates red and expert is wrong.

How can we master advanced science and technology? We must have the right method. Our method is what the Party teaches: to combine learning with humility with bold originality. Learning with humility means learning from books, learning from everyone, learning diligently, and learning tenaciously. We must take over all the useful knowledge in the world. We must strive to surpass our predecessors on the basis of learning from our predecessors.

In our struggle to conquer nature, we must also have revolutionary courage and a fighting spirit that will not stop until our goal is achieved, just like fighting class enemies. To make progress in science and technology, it is not enough to just learn the knowledge of our predecessors, we must also boldly create, boldly experiment, and not be afraid of difficulties or failures. Last year, Chairman Mao called on us to break down superstitions, emancipate our minds, and establish the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and to invigorate the spirit of dauntless creation, so that the creative spirit of our youth has been invigorated. More than 30 million mu of youth high-yield experimental fields and more than 1.4 million scientific and technological experimental field groups have emerged in people's communes across the country. Young workers in various places have put forward 10 million technological innovation suggestions, and a group of scientific workers engaged in creative research has begun to emerge among workers and peasant youth. Cai Zuquan, a worker in optical instruments, Wang Baojing, Jiang Shaofang, and Zhou Hanhua on the agricultural front, and Wei Gaohou and Liao Shigang, who are constantly innovating technology on the industrial front, are representatives of this. Last year, the research projects completed by teachers and students in more than 200 universities and colleges in just a few months exceeded the total of the eight years after liberation. All of these are new things with great vitality. Under the encouragement of the general line of socialist construction, our youth will continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland in developing science and culture.

Chinese Youth Always Stand at the Forefront of the Anti-Imperialist Struggle

Due to the teachings of the Party, Chinese youth have firmly established internationalist ideas. Our youth understand that the revolutionary struggle and construction struggle engaged in by the Chinese people are part of the international proletarian cause. The victories we have achieved are inseparable from the support and sympathy of the people of the world, especially the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. Imperialism still exists in the world. For the worldwide proletarian socialist cause to be consolidated and developed, we must continue to spare no effort to strengthen the unity of socialist brother countries and strengthen the unity of the people of the world. Chinese youth regard the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their lofty internationalist obligation. Chinese youth sternly condemned the traitorous acts of Yugoslav modern revisionism in opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat and serving imperialism. Chinese youth will hold high the banner of internationalism and resolutely fight modern revisionism to the end.

Our country has suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression and deeply feels the evils of the colonial system. Therefore, Chinese youth warmly support all struggles in the world against imperialism and the colonial system. Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has armed the minds of Chinese youth. Our youth understand that there can be no illusions about imperialism. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the people of all countries in the world will surely be victorious. The days of imperialism are getting worse and worse, and U.S. imperialism, the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, will inevitably suffer the most shameful and thorough defeat. Chinese youth will always firmly stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism.

In summary, actively guiding young people to participate in the political struggles of the whole people, eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology on young people in the struggle; educating young people to carry forward the communist spirit and actively participate in socialist construction; guiding young people to strive to master modern culture, science, and technology in the process of socialist construction; arming young people with proletarian internationalism and unswervingly supporting the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and socialism; these are the several fundamental issues of communist education of Chinese youth. The general purpose of carrying out these educations is to cultivate our young generation into active builders of socialism and communism.

Over the past decade, the Chinese Communist Youth League has followed the teachings of the Party and carried out a lot of work in the communist education of Chinese youth. Our Communist Youth League has become a powerful assistant to the Party and a core for attracting and uniting young people across the country to fight heroically for socialism.

Now, with new revolutionary drive, young people across the country are responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete or approach the completion of the main targets of the second five-year plan this year, and are heroically participating in the movement to increase production and practice economy. "Entering 1960 at high speed" has become the most magnificent fighting slogan of young workers. The broad masses of rural youth are fighting tirelessly to strive for more overproduction this year and for a greater harvest next year. The revolutionary competition movement is magnificent, and new activists are emerging in large numbers. With their own practical actions, the young people of our country have shown that they were, are, and always will be the strongest and bravest fighters in implementing the Party's general line.

Under the wise and correct leadership of our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao, the tomorrow of our motherland will surely be even brighter and more brilliant. Let us hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead courageously.

专栏：辉煌的十年

    中国青年的共产主义教育
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处第一书记　胡耀邦
    我们的伟大祖国，以无限强大的生命力，度过了它光辉的十年。
    我国六亿五千万人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下所进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是中国历史上前所未有的伟大的事业。这个事业，不仅要求彻底进行社会主义的经济革命，改变资本主义和个体的生产资料所有制，并且要求进行社会主义的政治革命和思想革命，彻底清除一切不合社会主义需要的观点和习惯势力。因此，改造人，教育人，培养新一代的问题，被提高到一个新的历史高度。当我们庆祝伟大的建国十周年的时候，回顾一下十年来中国青年的共产主义教育事业，是一件很有意义的事情。
    我国青年沿着党所指引的道路迅速成长起来
    中华人民共和国成立后，我们的党和毛主席运用马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论的原理，提出了一个又一个新的任务，引导我国人民不停顿地为着实现社会主义的伟大目标而斗争。在过去的民族民主革命斗争中，党曾把千百万青年团结在自己的周围，并把他们培养成为坚强的革命战士。由于革命在全国的胜利，由于革命不断发展的形势的需要，加强整个青年一代的教育和培养，引导他们积极参加社会主义革命和建设的斗争，培养他们成为社会主义的坚强战士，这就不仅有了可能，而且成为十分迫切的任务了。为此，党指示我们，必须大力加强青年的马克思列宁主义教育，在教育方法上，教导我们不要把青年的学习同整个社会生活隔离，而要同整个人民群众改造旧社会、建设新社会的斗争密切地结合起来。十年来，我国青年，就是沿着党所指出的这条道路成长起来的。
    在全国解放的初期，党领导全国人民进行了恢复国民经济的斗争，进行了伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国运动，进行了土地改革和镇压反革命运动，以及打退资产阶级猖狂进攻的“三反”“五反”运动。这个期间，半殖民地半封建旧中国遗留下来的帝国主义封建主义的旧影响还大量存在。党教导我们，必须彻底清除这些影响，革命的胜利才能够巩固和发展。我国青年坚决响应了党的号召，积极参加了上述运动，结合运动的每一个具体步骤，彻底批判了亲美崇美恐美的思想影响，大大提高了爱国主义和国际主义的政治觉悟，划清了劳动与剥削的界线，明确了要站稳工人阶级立场，为实行社会主义革命作了精神准备。
    从一九五三年起，党提出了过渡时期的总路线，领导了对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动，取得了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的伟大胜利。接着党又领导全国人民彻底打垮了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，进行了政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命运动。一九五八年的工农业生产大跃进中，党又在广大农村领导了伟大的人民公社化运动。这一系列新的社会主义革命运动，要求人们进一步批判资产阶级的思想影响，树立同社会主义制度相适应的社会主义思想和共产主义思想。我国青年响应了党的号召，积极参加了这些运动，并且接受运动的教育和锻炼，把自己的政治觉悟提高到社会主义思想的水平上来。特别是反对资产阶级右派的斗争，对我国青年是一次最深刻最生动的社会主义教育课。在党的领导下，我国青年普遍展开了社会主义同资本主义两条道路的大辩论，同资产阶级反党反社会主义的错误言行进行了尖锐的斗争，进一步坚定了走社会主义道路的意志和决心。
    经验证明：革命的阶级斗争和革命群众运动，是教育青年最好的学校。那种把教育同实践相割裂的资产阶级教育观点和教条主义论调，已经被事实驳倒了。
    在对青年的政治思想教育工作中，我们还同下述几种错误观点进行了斗争。
    一种观点说，青年纯洁得像一张白纸，共产主义思想可以自发地产生，不必进行思想教育、思想批判和改造。显然，这种观点是十分错误的。我们一向承认，青年是比较纯洁的，是比较容易接受新事物的。但是，青年并非就纯洁得像一张白纸。事实上，青年来自不同的社会阶层，接受着不同社会阶级的影响，不能不带有不同社会阶级思想的烙印。一部分剥削阶级家庭出身的青年，往往还带有较严重的剥削意识。社会上大量存在的资产阶级的世界观，资产阶级的政治观点，资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力，也必然要继续对青年有所影响。资产阶级及其政治影响，是不会自动退出历史舞台的。革命思想是不会自发产生的。在青年的思想阵地上，不是插无产阶级思想的红旗，就是插资产阶级思想的白旗。真空地带是没有的。放松思想教育改造工作，必然会招致资产阶级思想的泛滥，这是不利于青年的健康成长，不利于我们的事业的。
    还有一种观点说，向青年进行马克思列宁主义的教育，就妨碍了青年的自由思想和独立思考，限制了青年的个性发展。这当然也是十分错误的。这种观点的实质，是在所谓思想自由的幌子下，反对思想战线上的“兴无灭资”方针，保护资产阶级的思想阵地。什么叫自由？自由不是抽象的东西。违背了广大劳动人民的利益和意志，所谓自由就是虚伪的，实质上是为资产阶级和反动派效劳。有资产阶级的自由，就没有无产阶级的自由；有无产阶级的自由，就没有资产阶级的自由。一个灭掉另一个，只能如此，不能妥协。从我们马克思主义的自由观来看，自由就是对必然性的认识。马克思列宁主义是帮助人们认识世界和改造世界最犀利的武器。认真学习马克思列宁主义，彻底改造思想，根本不是限制人们的自由和个性发展，不是限制所谓独立思考，而恰恰是人们精神和个性的一大解放。正是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义，可以帮助人们打开智慧之窗，为了人民的最大利益和社会的进步，去充分发展个性和才能，并且最后使人类飞跃到“自由的王国”。
    党和毛主席教导我们，在我们的国家，现在还有阶级和阶级斗争存在，阶级斗争并没有结束。这种斗争，今后还是长期的，曲折的，有时甚至是激烈的。只是斗争形式不同，一起一伏，高一阵低一阵罢了。最近右倾机会主义分子对我国的大跃进、人民公社和党的总路线的污蔑和攻击，就是这种阶级斗争在我们革命队伍内部的反映，是一种资产阶级的反社会主义的思潮。既然有阶级斗争存在，有资产阶级的影响存在，我们就一时一刻也不能放松或削弱对青年的政治思想教育工作。我们必须把党的“兴无灭资”的教育方针坚持到底，继续不断地大立无产阶级思想，大破资产阶级思想。而在目前，则应当坚决地同右倾机会主义展开斗争，横扫右倾机会主义分子对革命群众运动的诽谤和污蔑，清除右倾思想对青年的腐蚀影响。要使我国青年都懂得：忠于总路线，就是忠于党，忠于社会主义。
    青年成为社会主义建设中的一支突击队
    由于我国青年迅速地提高了政治觉悟，树立了为社会主义而奋斗的政治方向，他们继承和发扬了我国人民勤劳勇敢的光荣传统，在党的领导下，成为社会主义建设中的一支突击队。
    亿万青年热烈响应党和毛主席的勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的号召，以战斗的姿态，热烈参加了恢复国民经济和超额完成第一个五年建设计划的伟大斗争。当时有几十万个青年突击队、生产队（班、组）、节约队、监督岗、山区建设队、绿化远征队等青年先进集体，奋战在经济建设的各个战线上，涌现出了像郝建秀、王崇伦、徐建春等千千万万个青年先进分子。有几百万青年奔赴辽远的边疆，在垦荒、筑路、开矿、建厂等英勇劳动中立下了功勋。
    一九五八年，我国开始实行第二个五年计划。党制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。总路线是我们党和毛主席把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同我国人民的革命实践相结合的产物，是我国人民要求尽快改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的伟大决心和伟大智慧的集中表现。这条总路线进一步调动了蕴藏在我国青年中的社会主义积极性。在蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义建设的群众运动中，广大青年意气风发，干劲冲天，在完成各项艰巨任务中冲锋陷阵，表现出惊人的毅力。为了祖国、为了集体，为了大跃进、为了人民公社，他们工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，哪里有困难，就在哪里出现。在一浪高一浪的竞赛热潮中，广大青年展开了“比先进、赶先进、学先进”的社会主义劳动竞赛，处处有红旗，行行有标兵。武汉市江岸车辆厂青年工人吴良湖亲自帮助两个落后小组变成先进小组的事迹，在全国青年中产生了极为强烈的反响。许多青年为了国家和集体利益而不惜牺牲自己的一切。青年女工向秀丽和青年战士安业民，就是这种自我牺牲的崇高典型。
    上述种种为国家和集体利益而英勇斗争的忘我精神，我们应当把它看作是我国青年思想领域中的共产主义的强大因素。这种共产主义的强大因素，是大跃进中生长出来的最宝贵的精神财富；是发展社会主义建设群众运动的巨大动力；是贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的重要保证。正是这种伟大的共产主义精神，充分揭示了人的主观能动性的巨大作用，使人们可以创造出过去不可能出现的伟大奇迹。发扬这种精神，对于加速我国的社会主义建设和培养新的一代，具有极为深远的意义。一切帝国主义及其走狗所最害怕的，也正是我国人民和青年的这种精神。
    有一些人，对于我国青年共产主义精神的昂扬，以及由此所产生的伟大成绩闭眼不看，他们夸大青年中由于缺乏经验而产生的个别缺点，给群众的积极性大泼冷水。这是一种令人不能容忍的资产阶级老爷式的态度。我们革命者同这种资产阶级老爷式的态度完全不同。在我们看来，第一，在党的正确领导下，青年工作的成绩总是主要的，而缺点是第二位的，是九个指头同一个指头的关系。我们应当看本质，看主流，而不应当只看缺点，一叶障目，攻其一点，不计其余。第二，这些缺点是伟大前进中产生的。贵在前进。在继续前进中间，任何缺点也是不难克服的。因此，我们应当满腔热情地去赞扬青年的共产主义精神，满腔热情地去支持青年的革命积极性。
    还有一些人，他们认为只要实行物质鼓励，就可以充分激发人们建设社会主义的积极性，不必去加强政治思想教育，发扬共产主义精神。这也是错误的。当然，“按劳分配”这个社会主义的原则，在现阶段是必须贯彻实行的。但是仅仅依靠这个原则是远远不够的。毛主席教导我们，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。人们的共产主义思想，不可能自发地生长起来，而必须依靠加强教育。只有把对青年的政治思想教育和物质鼓励结合起来，并且以政治为统帅，为灵魂，才能正确地贯彻执行“按劳分配”的原则，才能持久地发挥青年的革命干劲，才能使青年最后彻底摆脱资产阶级的利己主义的影响和庸俗的低级趣味。
    青年要做到又红又专，边红边专，红透专深
    为着把我们的祖国建设成为一个社会主义强国，不仅要进行政治革命和经济革命，而且还必须进行文化革命和技术革命。在我们面前有着两种性质的斗争，即阶级斗争和生产斗争。虽然阶级斗争还将是长时期的，但是生产斗争的任务是越来越大了。掌握先进科学技术已经成为更加特别迫切的任务。
    我国教育事业的发展，采用了两条腿走路的方针。这就是除了兴办各种类型的正规学校之外，还提倡各种形式的群众办学，开展强大的群众业余学习运动。到1958年为止，我国青年中文盲的比例从解放初期的80％下降到30％—40％。去年参加红专学校和各种业余学校的青年，已达五千万人以上。业余学习有力地推动了技术革命和生产发展。事实证明，这是多快好省地发展人民教育事业的正确途径。任何轻视业余学习的观点都是十分错误和有害的。
    毛主席教导我们，要把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强国，必须造就一支宏大的工人阶级自己的知识分子队伍，人少了是不行的。党号召青年做“又红又专”的人，我们的党把掌握现代文化科学技术这样一个艰巨而光荣的任务，主要放在这一代青年身上。
    如何正确地对待“又红又专”的要求，在青年中是有着尖锐的思想斗争的。1957年，结合反对资产阶级右派斗争和整风运动，我们批判了“先专后红”，实质上就是“只专不红”的资产阶级的观点，使青年学生懂得政治挂帅的重要性。但是，也有些青年学生又产生了“先红后专”“红难专易”等片面性的认识。事实上，先“红”后“专”，也是不行的。“红”是没有止境的，等红透了再“专”，实际上就是不“专”，至于“专”，也并非易事。今天我国六亿五千万人民正在为改变祖国面貌，向地球开战，这就必须要用现代文化科学技术作为武器。轻视“专”是没有任何理由的。我们的口号是：又红又专，边红边专，红透专深。任何把红专割裂开来的论调都是错误的。
    怎样才能掌握先进科学技术呢？我们必须有正确的方法。我们的方法就是党所教导的：把虚心学习同大胆独创结合起来。虚心学习，就是向书本学，向一切人学，刻苦地学，顽强地学。我们要把世界上一切有用的知识统统都拿过来。我们要力争在学习前人的基础上，超过前人。
    我们在征服自然的斗争中，也要像同阶级敌人斗争那样，具有革命胆略和不达目的誓不休止的战斗精神。要在科学技术上有所发展，仅仅学习前人的知识是不够的，还必须大胆创造，大胆试验，不怕困难，不怕失败。去年毛主席号召我们，破除迷信，解放思想，树立敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，振奋大无畏的创造精神，使得我国青年的创造精神昂扬起来。各地人民公社出现了三千多万亩青年丰产试验田，一百四十多万个科学技术的试验场组。各地青年工人提出的技术革新建议有一千万件，并且在工农青年中已开始出现一批进行创造性研究的科学工作者。光学仪器工作者蔡祖泉，农业战线上的王保京、蒋少芳、周汉华，工业战线上不断革新技术的能手魏高厚、廖世刚等，就是这方面的代表人物。去年二百多所高等学校的师生，在短短几个月中所完成的研究项目，就超过了解放后八年的总和。所有这些，都是极有生命力的新生事物。在社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，我国青年将继续发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，在发展科学文化方面，为祖国社会主义建设作出更大贡献。
    中国青年永远站在反帝斗争的最前列
    由于党的教导，中国青年牢牢地树立了国际主义思想。我国青年懂得，中国人民所从事的革命斗争和建设斗争，是国际无产阶级事业的一部分。我们所获得的胜利，是和全世界人民的支持和同情，首先是和苏联以及其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助分不开的。世界上还存在着帝国主义。全世界无产阶级社会主义事业要巩固和发展，必须继续不遗余力地加强社会主义兄弟国家的团结，加强全世界人民的团结。中国青年把巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，作为自己崇高的国际主义义务。中国青年严正地谴责了南斯拉夫现代修正主义反对无产阶级专政，为帝国主义效劳的叛徒行为。中国青年高举国际主义的大旗和现代修正主义坚决斗争到底。
    我们的国家受过帝国主义的长期侵略和压迫，深感殖民主义制度的罪恶。因此，中国青年热烈地支持世界上一切反对帝国主义和殖民主义制度的斗争。毛主席的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，武装了中国青年的思想。我国青年懂得，对于帝国主义不能存在任何幻想。我们坚信世界各国人民的正义斗争一定会获得胜利。帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义必将遭到最可耻最彻底的失败。中国青年永远坚决地站在反对帝国主义斗争的前列。
    综上所述，积极引导青年参加全民的政治斗争，在斗争中清除资产阶级思想对青年的影响；教育青年发扬共产主义精神，积极参加社会主义建设；在社会主义建设过程中，引导青年努力掌握现代文化科学技术；用无产阶级国际主义武装青年，坚定不移地支持各国人民争取和平和社会主义的斗争；这就是中国青年共产主义教育的几个根本问题。进行这些教育的总的目的，在于培养我国青年一代成为社会主义和共产主义的积极建设者。
    十年来，中国共产主义青年团遵循党的教导，在我国青年共产主义教育事业中进行了许多工作。我们共青团已成为党的有力助手，成为吸引和团结全国青年为社会主义而英勇奋斗的核心。
    现在，全国青年正以新的革命干劲，响应党的八届八中全会关于在今年完成或接近完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的伟大号召，英勇地参加增产节约运动。“高速度地跨进一九六○年”，成了青年工人的最雄壮的战斗口号。广大农村青年为力争今年多超产和争取明年的更大丰收而奋战不息。革命竞赛运动波澜壮阔，新的积极分子风起云涌。我国青年用自己的实际行动表明，他们过去是、现在是、将来也永远是贯彻执行党的总路线的最坚强最勇敢的战士。
    在我们伟大的党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明正确的领导下，我们祖国的明天必将更加光明灿烂。让我们高举马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的红旗，奋勇前进。
