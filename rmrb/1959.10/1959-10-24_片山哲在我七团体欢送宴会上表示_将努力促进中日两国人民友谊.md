    Liu Ningyi spoke first at the banquet, expressing his gratitude to the Japanese delegation from all walks of life, headed by Mr. Tetsuya Katayama, for coming to participate in our country's 10th anniversary celebration. Liu Ningyi said that during their stay in China, the Japanese delegation from all walks of life exchanged views with all of us and issued a joint statement; the issuance of the joint statement has further advanced the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

    Mr. Tetsuya Katayama then delivered a speech, expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the welcome and warm reception the Japanese delegation from all walks of life received in China. Mr. Tetsuya Katayama, when talking about the joint statement issued by the delegation and the seven Chinese organizations, emphasized that this statement will help promote the friendship between the people of Japan and China and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The delegation will, based on the spirit of the joint statement and relying on its own strength, be determined to fight to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and to abolish this treaty. We believe that realizing friendship between the people of Japan and China and restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China is the best policy for Japan to eliminate U.S. control.

    Katayama Tetsuya said that all thirty members of our delegation are peace lovers, and this visit to China has strengthened our determination to eliminate war in the world and strive for world peace. He also stated that they will carry the friendship of Chinese friends for the Japanese people into the movement to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.
