Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Seventy thousand Beijing spectators today were satisfied to watch a world-class soccer match – a brilliant and tense friendly match between the Soviet national soccer team and the Hungarian national soccer team's second team. After ninety minutes of fierce competition, the two world soccer powerhouses drew 1-1.

This was an evenly matched game. The Hungarian team, with its delicate movements, opened the long-standing deadlock only after seventy-five minutes of play. At that time, the Soviet team was attacking the Hungarian team with all its might, with even the defenders running to the midfield to assist in the attack. But then, Hungarian center forward Bozsik suddenly received the ball in the midfield. He advanced quickly alone with the ball. By the time three Soviet defenders turned around to chase him, Bozsik had already dribbled the ball to about twenty meters to the left of the Soviet penalty area. He raised his foot and shot powerfully, causing the goal defended by Soviet goalkeeper Ivakin, who had rushed out to save the ball, to be breached for the first time. Hungary took a 1-0 lead, and the audience erupted in applause.

With only the last fifteen minutes of the game remaining, the audience was worried about whether the Soviet team could reverse the defeat. But at this time, the Soviet team adjusted its lineup, replacing right winger Ulin with the twenty-year-old athlete Chislenko, and launched a fierce counterattack. Only seven minutes later, Chislenko scored the goal that resulted in the final tie in a melee in front of the Hungarian goal.

The situation when the Soviet team scored this goal was as follows: Soviet left inside forward Mamadov first took a shot, and the ball hit the Hungarian goalpost several times. After the ball bounced out, it fell at the feet of Chislenko, who was on the right side of the Hungarian penalty area. He shot again without hesitation, and Hungarian goalkeeper Faragó was too late to rush out to save it. The ball rolled quickly into the empty net. In the following few minutes, neither side scored again, and the two teams finally shook hands in a draw.

After the game, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Vice Premier He Long went to the field to shake hands with the players of both sides one by one and took photos together. At this time, warm applause rang out from the audience again, thanking the two teams for their wonderful performance.

The Soviet team players played fiercely, passed the ball quickly, and mainly used the two fast-running wingers, Ilyin and Ulin, to launch attacks. They dribbled the ball to the corners and then passed the ball to the middle, where other players rushed up to shoot. The Hungarian team players, on the other hand, mostly used skilled triangular short passes to advance step by step. However, because the defenders of both teams marked closely, it was relatively difficult for both sides to score today, and the main focus was on fierce competition in the midfield.

The Soviet team, less than a minute after the start of today's game, launched a "lightning" fast attack, just like in the game against the Chinese team. Center forward Ivanov got the ball and immediately took a long shot. Hungarian goalkeeper Faragó saved the bouncing ball twice before holding it in his arms. Twelve minutes later, danger also appeared in front of the Soviet goal. A "direct free kick" by Hungarian left back Novák was saved by Soviet goalkeeper Ivakin. Hungarian right winger Nemes then took another shot, which was also blocked by Ivakin. Hungarian center forward Bozsik then kicked it, but it went out of bounds, which relieved the audience.

After that, a seesaw battle unfolded on the field. The audience cheered for the superb skills of both teams in passing the ball without stopping, and also cheered and congratulated the goalkeepers of both teams for their witty and decisive saving techniques with both hands and feet.

    一场世界水平的足球赛
    苏匈足球友谊赛以一比一踢平
    新华社5日讯　七万名北京观众今天满意地观赏了一场世界水平的足球赛——苏联国家足球队同匈牙利国家足球队第二队的精采、紧张的友谊比赛。两个世界足球劲旅经过九十分钟的激烈争夺，以一比一踢成平局。
    这是一场势均力敌的比赛。动作细腻的匈牙利队在比赛进行了七十五分钟时，才打开了长时间的难解难分的僵局。当时，苏联队正在全力向匈牙利队进攻，连后卫都跑到中线助攻。但这时匈牙利队中锋博得尔突然在中场接到了来球，他单枪匹马地快速带球前进，等苏联队三个后卫转身回来追赶时，博得尔已经带球到了苏联队禁区左方约二十米的地方，他抬脚猛力一射，使跑出来救球的苏联队守门员伊瓦金把守的球门第一次失守。匈牙利队以一比零领先，观众掌声四起。
    全场比赛还剩最后十五分钟了，苏联队能不能挽回败局，观众在为苏联队担心。但这时苏联队调整了阵容，由二十岁的运动健将齐斯连科换下了右边锋乌林，展开了猛烈的反攻。才过七分钟，齐斯连科在匈牙利队球门前的混战中，就射入了造成最后平局的一球。
    苏联队射进这一球的情况是：当时苏联队左内锋马迈多夫先射了一脚，这个球碰得匈牙利队的球门框震动了几下，球弹出后落到正在匈牙利队禁区右方的齐斯连科的脚下，他毫不犹豫地又射了一脚，匈牙利队守门员法拉戈跑出扑救时已经来不及，球急速地滚进了空门。在以后的几分钟里，双方都无建树，两队终于握手言和。
    比赛结束以后，董必武副主席和贺龙副总理等人都走到球场上同双方队员一一握手，并且合影留念。这时，观众中又响起了热烈的掌声，感谢两队的精采表演。
    苏联队队员踢球勇猛，传球快速，多利用两个奔跑迅速的边锋伊林和乌林展开进攻，由他们带球到两角，然后把球传到中间，由其他队员冲上去射门。而匈牙利队队员则多利用熟练的三角短传向前步步逼进，但由于两队后卫盯人都很紧，所以今天双方都比较难射门，主要在中场展开激烈的争夺。
    苏联队今天在比赛开始不到一分钟时，又像同中国队比赛那次一样，来了一个“闪电式”的快攻，中锋伊万诺夫得球后马上远射，匈牙利队守门员法拉戈扑了两次才把这个跳动的球抱在怀里。过了十二分钟，苏联队球门前也出现了险象。匈牙利队左后卫诺瓦克踢出的“直接任意球”被苏联队守门员伊瓦金扑出后，匈牙利队右边锋奈美斯又射了一脚，又被伊瓦金挡出，匈牙利队中锋博得尔再踢一脚偏出界外，才使观众松了一口气。
    以后，场上就展开了拉锯战，观众为两队不用停球就传球的高超技巧叫好，也为两队守门员手脚并用的机智、果断的救球技术欢呼祝贺。（附图片）
