    New Atmosphere in October
    Liuyang Pujie Commune Deng Xinmin The rural atmosphere in October is new, mountains and plains are full of gold and silver; tea trees in the mountains are full of pearls, and rice paddies are like golden seas. The rural atmosphere in October is new, the drums of harvest are beating loudly; commune members are busy harvesting day and night, everywhere is a city that never sleeps! The rural atmosphere in October is new, harvest songs echo throughout the fields; singing long live the General Line! Singing the commune will last ten thousand years!

    十月气象新
    浏阳普迹公社　邓新民十月农村气象新，漫山遍野尽金银；山中茶树珍珠满，满垅稻海似黄金。十月农村气象新，收割战鼓响咚咚；社员日夜忙收割，到处都是不夜城！十月农村气象新，丰收山歌响满垅；歌唱总路线万岁！歌唱公社万年春！
