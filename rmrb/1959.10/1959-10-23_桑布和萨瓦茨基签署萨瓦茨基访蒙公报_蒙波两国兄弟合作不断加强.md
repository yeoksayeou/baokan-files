Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 21st: Sambu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, and Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish State Council, signed a communiqué here this afternoon regarding Zawadzki's visit to the Mongolian People's Republic.

The communiqué stated that Comrade Zawadzki, along with accompanying Polish state leaders and political activists, held talks with Mongolian state leaders in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. Both sides were in complete agreement on further developing fraternal cooperation between the two countries and on their views on current international issues. Both sides noted with satisfaction that political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries is constantly strengthening.

Both sides believe that further consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and uniting all progressive forces in the world to strive for peace are the main prerequisites for their peaceful socialist construction.

The communiqué gave high praise to the achievements made by the Soviet Union in implementing a peaceful foreign policy. The communiqué stated that the results of Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States, which made a significant contribution to easing international tensions, were a great victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. Mongolia and Poland fully support the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, considering it a practical and feasible measure to eliminate the threat of war.

The communiqué stated that the best way to resolve international disputes is through peaceful consultation, and both sides have always believed that convening a summit meeting is of great significance. Mongolia and Poland believe that concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin are pressing issues to be resolved.

The Mongolian People's Republic reiterated that the Oder-Neisse line is the legal and inviolable territory of Poland. The Polish People's Republic has consistently supported the just demand of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations and other international organizations.

The communiqué stated that Mongolia and Poland give high praise to the contributions made by the People's Republic of China in strengthening the power of the socialist camp and safeguarding world peace. Both sides fully support the People's Republic of China enjoying its legitimate rights in the United Nations and recovering its inalienable territory of Taiwan.

The communiqué pointed out that submitting the so-called "Tibet issue" to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion is an attempt to further intensify the "Cold War" and interfere in China's internal affairs.

The communiqué stated that both sides will continue to support the struggle of the Korean people and the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their homelands in the future.

The communiqué pointed out that Zawadzki's visit to Mongolia will contribute to the further development of political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries and to the consolidation of the unity of the peoples of the socialist camp.

The communiqué concluded by saying that Chairman Zawadzki invited Chairman Sambu to visit Poland at an appropriate time, and Chairman Sambu gladly accepted this invitation.

The Mongolian side participating in the communiqué signing ceremony included Mongolian party and government leaders Tsedenbal and Tsende. The Polish side participating in the signing ceremony included Polish Deputy Premier Ignar and Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Politburo member Gierek.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar: The Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia held a banquet on the evening of the 20th to welcome Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish State Council. Sambu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, delivered a speech at the banquet. He extended a warm welcome to Zawadzki and the Polish guests who came with him to visit Mongolia.

On the afternoon of the 21st, the working people of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, held a grand rally of 70,000 people in Sukhbaatar Square to welcome Zawadzki, Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic.
