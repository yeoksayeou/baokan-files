Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th - Mass movements in Shanghai's steel industry have seen new developments. A record-breaking movement with even greater momentum, faster results, and more extensive promotion of workers' daring thinking and working style is unfolding in all production links of steel mills across the city, including steelmaking, steel rolling, furnace demolition, furnace building, charging, and transportation. Workers in all trades have created many new achievements, greatly shortening the production process.

This movement was first launched by the Class B furnace building workers in the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5. On September 21, when repairing No. 1 converter, they broke down conservative thinking and successively created four new records for furnace demolition time, furnace building time, overall furnace repair time, and extending furnace life. Among them, the Zhang Zhijiang furnace building team, integrating the experience of various furnace building teams, adopted new operation methods such as cross-parallel furnace building and double hoisting of bricks, using one hour and fifty-eight minutes (less than one-tenth of the average furnace building time in the first half of the year) to build an eight-ton converter, creating an amazing record. The furnace life of this converter reached sixty-eight heats, exceeding the factory's highest level.

The pioneering spirit of the Zhang Zhijiang team immediately attracted the attention of the Party Committee of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5. At 10 p.m. that night, the Party Secretary rushed to the workshop to arrange a summary of the experience of creating this new record; after returning to the factory headquarters, the Party Committee held an overnight meeting to discuss it. The Party Committee believes that the emergence of this new record not only shows that furnace building time can be greatly shortened and steel production can be further increased; but more importantly, it reflects that the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the labor competition between shifts and groups in the previous period has seen new development. The next afternoon, the Party Committee convened a cadres' meeting, calling on all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and all factory workers to learn from the ambition of the Class B furnace building workers to strive for the top and despise difficulties, and the spirit of combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and to launch a vigorous record-breaking movement, with everyone creating one or several new records. Two days later, the Shanghai Steel Party Committee also gathered a group of furnace building workers and cadres from steel mills across the city to hold an on-site meeting at Plant No. 5, organize technical demonstrations, and call on steel workers in various trades across the city to learn from the pioneering spirit of the furnace building workers of Plant No. 5 and universally carry out the record-breaking movement. The Steel Party Committee also combined the mass record-breaking movement with the technical demonstrations being promoted in various factories, organizing technical demonstrations wherever outstanding new records appeared.

The record-breaking movement has rapidly promoted and developed advanced operating techniques, quickly changing the face of steel production. After the city's furnace building workers learned from the operating experience of Plant No. 5, the cycle of building converters generally shortened from ten hours to three to five hours, and steel production also increased sharply with the increase in furnace supply. The record for furnace building in Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 is even higher, creating a record of building a converter in forty-nine minutes. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 also saw a new record for rapid building of cupola furnaces: in the past, it took more than ten hours to build one, now it only takes two hours and eighteen minutes. After organizing technical demonstrations, the furnace building time for cupola furnaces in various factories across the city has generally been shortened to five or six hours. Workers in the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 launched a record-breaking competition to shorten charging time, reducing the charging time for each heat of steel from about one hundred and ten minutes in the past to less than one hundred minutes; the shortest heat even created a new record of seventy-eight minutes.

    劳动竞赛的新发展　力争上游的好形式
    上钢创纪录运动异军突起
    据新华社上海20日电　上海市钢铁工业中群众运动有了新的发展。一个冲劲更猛、收效更快、更能广泛地发扬职工敢想敢作风格的创纪录运动，正在全市各钢铁厂的炼钢、轧钢、拆炉、砌炉、上料、运输等各个生产环节上普遍展开。各工种的工人都创造出许多新的成绩，大大缩短了生产过程。
    这个运动是上钢五厂转炉车间的乙班砌炉工人首先发动的。9月21日，他们在修砌一号转炉时，大破保守思想，连续创造了拆炉时间、砌炉时间、整个修炉时间和延长炉龄的四个新纪录。其中，张志江砌炉小组综合各个砌炉小组的经验，采用交叉平行砌炉及双吊运砖的新操作法，用一小时又五十八分（还不到上半年平均砌炉时间的十分之一）砌好一只八吨转炉，创造了惊人的纪录。这只转炉炉龄达到六十八炉，超过本厂最高水平。
    张志江小组这一首创精神，立即引起了上钢五厂党委的重视。当晚十时，党委书记赶到车间布置总结创造这次新纪录的经验；回到厂部又连夜召开党委会讨论。党委认为，这个新纪录的出现，不仅说明砌炉时间可以大大缩短，钢产量可以进一步提高；而更重要的是，它反映了党的八届八中全会的精神已经深入人心，前一时期班与班、组与组之间的劳动竞赛又有了新的发展。第二天下午，党委召开干部大会，号召所有共产党员、共青团员和全厂职工，人人学习乙班砌炉工人那种力争上游、藐视困难的志气和苦干、实干、巧干相结合的精神，开展一个轰轰烈烈的创纪录运动，大家都创造出一项或几项新的纪录。两天之后，上海钢铁党委又召集全市钢铁厂一批砌炉工人和干部，到五厂开现场会，组织技术表演赛，号召全市各个工种的钢铁工人，学习五厂砌炉工人的首创精神，普遍开展创纪录运动。钢铁党委并且把群众性的创纪录运动同正在各厂推广的技术表演结合起来，哪里有突出的新纪录出现，就到哪里去组织技术表演。
    创纪录运动，使先进操作技术得到迅速推广和发展，迅速地改变了钢铁生产的面貌。全市砌炉工人学习五厂操作经验以后，砌转炉的周期普遍从十小时缩短到三、五小时，钢产量也随着炉子供应增多而猛长。上钢五厂砌炉的纪录更是一个高过一个，创造了四十九分钟砌一只转炉的最高纪录。上钢一厂也出现了快速砌化铁炉的新纪录：过去砌一只要花十多小时，现在只用二小时又十八分。经过组织技术表演，全市各厂化铁炉砌炉时间普遍缩短到五、六小时。上钢一厂平炉车间工人展开了一个缩短加料时间的创纪录竞赛，使每炉钢的加料时间从过去一百一十分钟左右缩短到一百分钟以内；最短的一炉，更创造七十八分钟的新纪录。
