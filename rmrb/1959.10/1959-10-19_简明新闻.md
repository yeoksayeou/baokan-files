　　Phoenix Tail Rice with Three Ears on One Plant
　　In the experimental fields of Wang Mingxian, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, Wang Wangui, production team leader, and Communist Party member Zhao Shifu, of the Mingxing Production Team of the Gaochao People's Commune in Mian County, Shaanxi Province, there were four rice plants, each growing three ears. Each plant produced more than 570 grains. One of the plants was four feet seven inches tall, with a stem as thick as a finger, and full, plump grains. The main ear had 326 grains, the left side ear had 141 grains, and the right side ear had 148 grains, for a total of 615 grains. This is more than 200 grains higher than the average ear of about 400 grains in this field, and four times higher than the average of about 100 grains per ear in the large-area fields of other varieties in the team.
　　This rice is called Phoenix Tail Rice, and it is a new variety cultivated by Wang Mingxian last year.
