Millions of People Vigorously Engage in the "Minor Autumn Harvest"

Jilin, Shandong, Shanxi, and Sichuan Launch Large-Scale Movement to Collect Wild Plants

　　Changchun, October 16th (report from this newspaper) – Jilin Province, rich in wild plant resources, has achieved a great victory in collection and procurement this autumn. As of October 10th, the province has collected over two million tons of various wild plants, including wild oil, wine materials, and major wild plants such as sheep grass and reeds, which have increased more than nine times compared to last year, providing timely supplies for industrial and agricultural production.

　　This year, wild plants in the eastern mountainous areas and western grasslands of Jilin Province have generally had a bumper harvest. Under the slogan of "Agriculture must be done well, sideline occupations must not be abandoned, ensuring a double harvest of agriculture and sideline occupations," people's communes in various regions have made every effort to organize the masses to vigorously collect, and commercial departments have actively increased outlets and organized a large number of personnel to procure on the spot. In September, an unprecedented procurement upsurge occurred throughout the province, with the number of people engaged in sideline production reaching 1.18 million, of which more than 750,000 went to the mountains and grasslands, an increase of onefold compared to last year.

　　In organizing collection work, various regions have generally adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and letting ideology lead, with secretaries taking the lead and committee members taking responsibility, giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and properly arranging labor. They have also adopted the working methods of seizing opportunities, racing against time, doing a little during the busy farming season, doing a lot during the slack farming season, and working hard whenever there is free time, launching a vigorous mass movement. As a result, commune members are full of enthusiasm, sideline production is unprecedentedly active, and procurement is progressing rapidly. For example, Tonghua Special District mobilized the masses, and the total value of agricultural and sideline native products procured in one day and night reached 3.04 million yuan, equivalent to the total procurement volume in the first half of the month. At the same time, they also transported over 10,000 tons of various materials to the transportation routes.

　　While organizing the masses to carry out collection, various regions have also dispatched a large number of cadres to organize a procurement army of more than 16,000 people, added more than 5,000 procurement points, and adopted a combination of regular procurement and mobile procurement, a combination of frequent procurement and concentrated procurement, and a combination of professional procurement and mass procurement, going deep into the field for procurement. At the same time, in cooperation with the transportation departments, they have adopted a combination of short-distance transportation and long-distance transportation, a combination of regular transportation and concentrated transportation, and a combination of trunk line transportation and branch line transportation, actively transporting and supplying the needs of industrial and agricultural production in a timely manner.

　　Jinan, October 17th (Xinhua News Agency) – Shandong Province, rich in wild plant resources, has launched a mass movement to collect wild plants in a concentrated campaign from the mountains to the hills, from the plains to the coastal grasslands and wasteland areas.

　　In Zibo Special District and four counties in Linyi Special District – Yishui, Tancheng, Rizhao, and Yiyuan – located in the coastal areas, the labor force engaged in collecting wild plants has reached more than 230,000 people, and they have already collected more than 19.7 million jin of wild plant oilseeds, starch, tannin, fiber, medicinal materials, and other raw materials. According to surveys, there are 5 million mu of coastal wasteland, more than 1,000 square kilometers of barren mountains, and more than 330 types of wild plants that can be used as raw materials for oil, tannin, fiber, and starch, with an annual output of about 2 billion jin. Currently, expedition teams organized by various regions are continuously setting up camps and collecting here. The industrial and commercial departments of Changwei Special District have organized more than 500 people to collect here. The Qingdao Paper Mill has also organized 170 workers to establish a pulp mill here.

　　In areas where wild plants are scattered, while vigorously carrying out the "Three Autumns" work, activities of "don't go to the mountains or slopes empty-handed, don't return home with empty baskets" have also been launched to mobilize the masses, and auxiliary labor forces such as the elderly, children, and students have been organized for collection. Haiyang County alone procured more than 800,000 jin of wild plant raw materials collected by the masses in just seven days.

　　In order to mobilize the masses to collect and facilitate the identification of varieties, various regions, in conjunction with the current campaign to increase production and practice economy, have widely publicized the purchase prices, varieties, and specifications of various wild plants to the masses using physical exhibitions and printed materials. The commercial departments in various regions also combined the current high tide of agricultural and sideline product procurement, adopting the method of seizing everything when going out and dividing up the products when returning. According to recent statistics from five regions, including Linyi, Heze, and Jining, 6 million jin of wild plant oil, starch, fiber, tannin, and other four raw materials have been procured.

　　Taiyuan, October 17th (Xinhua News Agency) – Shanxi Province currently has a professional team and a shock brigade of 2 million people fighting in the deep mountains and dense forests, collecting various wild plants. In Wutai County, in the Jinbei area, as of the beginning of October, more than 490 types of materials had been collected, including timber, small mountain goods, medicinal materials, mushrooms, rootless vegetables, wild oilseeds, wild fiber raw materials, and wild brewing raw materials, totaling 14.03 million jin. The Taihang Mountains, known as the treasure mountain, have more than 384,000 people climbing mountains, cutting through thorns, and entering the mountains to collect treasures. As of the beginning of October, 4.26 million jin of various wild plant raw materials have been collected. Licheng County formulated long-term collection and short-term concentrated campaigns based on the concentration and dispersion of local wild plant resources. By mid-September, 310,000 jin of medicinal materials and oilseeds had been collected. Wuxiang County divided the county into four war zones, with a collection force of 30,000 people. By the end of September, 660,000 jin of wild oilseeds, fiber, medicinal materials, and other materials had been collected.

　　Party committees at all levels in Shanxi Province have strengthened their leadership over the acquisition of wild plants this year. Since September, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has held three telephone conferences in a row to urge and inspect the province's agricultural products and wild plant acquisition work. Leading cadres of local committees and county committees personally led this work, fully mobilizing the masses. Therefore, a concentrated campaign to collect wild plants quickly formed throughout the province. During the collection and acquisition process, Taiyuan and Linfen in the Jinnan Special District, and other places put forward the slogan of finding raw materials for industry, finding sources of goods for the market, finding income for farmers, and finding capital for production, which was quickly echoed throughout the province. Under this slogan, the Wutai County Party Committee closely combined autumn harvest work, organized a professional collection team of 50,000 people, and more than 70% of the commercial personnel went deep into the communes to organize mass collection and acquisition, dispatching 70% of the transportation capacity to ensure timely transportation and processing.

　　70% of Shanxi Province's area is mountainous and hilly, and wild plants are widely distributed, with large yields and many varieties. After communization, with the expansion of production scale and business scope, favorable conditions were created for vigorously cultivating and collecting wild plants. This year, many communes conducted surveys of wild resources and extracted labor to concentrate on collection. It is estimated that the province's acquisition of four types of wild plant raw materials – oilseeds, starch, fiber, and tannin – will increase three to six times compared to last year, and the acquisition value will reach more than five million yuan.

　　Chengdu, October 17th (report from this newspaper) – Under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangement, commercial departments and people's communes in Sichuan Province are organizing millions of people to go to the mountains, ensuring that no opportunity is missed and no variety is overlooked, to collect a large number of wild plant raw materials to support cities and factories.

　　This year, Party committees and commercial departments in various parts of Sichuan Province, based on the different production seasons of wild plants and adhering to the spirit of combining year-round collection and acquisition with short-term concentrated campaigns, have completed the annual procurement plan ahead of schedule from January to September. Among them, the acquisition of wild tannin raw materials alone reached 320,000 dan, an increase of 1.2 times compared to the total acquisition volume last year. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, commercial workers and people's commune members boosted even greater enthusiasm, and taking advantage of the agricultural slack season, they launched another high tide of collection and acquisition. Now, every county in the province has a prospecting team, and every commune has prospectors and purchasers, seizing both large-scale products and small-scale products, striving to complete the annual acquisition plan ahead of schedule and in excess of the target by variety.

　　In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and speed up the acquisition of wild plant raw materials, so that more is collected, faster is acquired, and the quality is good, the acquisition departments in various regions have set acquisition targets and progress, and then implemented the plans to the communes and production teams. Zhongxian County, one of the key counties in the province, adopted this method. In the first three quarters of this year, the county's acquisition of wild fiber, chemical raw materials, oilseeds, starch, medicinal materials, and other materials for the state has exceeded the total for the whole of last year by more than onefold, and the communes' income has also increased by 1.96 million yuan.

　　Commercial departments have adopted the method of simultaneous acquisition, processing, and transportation, and are currently transporting the newly released batches of wild plant raw materials to various parts of the province and to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces. These wild plant raw materials are all processed into semi-finished products by local processing plants and then transported out. In transportation, in addition to utilizing the communes' professional transportation teams, many regions have adopted a relay transportation method by sub-station, utilizing commune members' spare time and carrying transportation during market days. The commercial departments of Liangping County have relied on the masses to achieve complete success in the procurement, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products and wild plants.

　　为工业增原料为商业增货源为生产增资金为农民增收入
    千军万马大闹“小秋收”
    吉林山东山西四川采集野生植物突击运动声势浩大
    本报长春16日电　盛产野生植物的吉林省，今秋以来在采集和收购方面打了一个大胜仗。截至10月10日止，全省已采集各种野生植物二百多万吨，其中野生油、酒料和羊草、芦苇等主要野生植物的收购量，比去年增加九倍多，及时的供应了工农业生产的需要。
    今年，吉林省东部山区和西部草原上的野生植物普遍丰收。各地人民公社在“农业要搞好，副业也不丢，保证农副双丰收”的口号下，千方百计的组织群众大力采集，商业部门积极增设网点，组织大批人员就地收购。9月份，全省出现了空前的采购高潮，投入副业生产人数高达一百一十八万人，仅上山进草原的人数就有七十五万多，比去年增加一倍。
    各地在组织采集工作中，普遍做到了政治挂帅，思想领先，书记出马，委员包干，充分运用人民公社的优越性，妥善地安排了劳力；并采取抓时机、争分秒，农忙小搞、农闲大搞，见空狠搞的工作方法，大搞群众运动。因此，社员干劲十足，副业生产空前活跃，收购进度很快。如通化专区发动群众，一昼夜农副土特产品收购总值达三百零四万元，相当于前半月收购量的总和，同时还把各种物资运到交通沿线达一万余吨。
    各地在组织群众进行采集的同时，还抽调大批干部组织了一万六千多人的收购大军，增设了五千多个收购点，采取定期收购与流动收购相结合，经常收购与突击收购相结合，专业收购与群众收购相结合的方法，深入现场进行收购；同时，并与交通部门协作，采取短途运输与长途运输相结合，经常运输与突击运输相结合，干线运输与支线运输相结合的方法，积极调运，及时的供应了工农业生产的需要。
    据新华社济南17日电　野生植物资源丰富的山东省，从山区到丘陵，从大平原到海滨草原荒洼地区，已掀起一个群众性的采集野生植物突击运动。
    位于海滨地区的淄博专区和临沂专区的沂水、郯城、日照、沂源等四个县，投入采集野生植物的劳动力达二十三万多人，已经采集野生植物油料、淀粉、栲胶、纤维、药材等原料一千九百七十多万斤。据勘查有海滩荒洼地五百万亩，荒山一千多平方公里，发现能作油、栲胶、纤维、淀粉等原料的野生植物三百三十多种，年产量可达二十亿斤左右。目前各地组织的远征队正在络绎不绝地到这里安营寨采集。昌潍专区的工商部门已经组织了五百多人到这里采集。青岛造纸厂也组织一百七十多名工人在这里建立纸浆厂。
    在野生植物分散的产地，在大搞三秋工作的同时，也发动群众开展“上山下坡不空手，回家不空篓”的活动，同时组织老人、儿童、学生等辅助劳力进行采集。海阳县仅七天时间就收购了群众采集的野生植物原料八十多万斤。
    为了发动群众采集和便于识别品种，各地结合当前增产节约运动的宣传，利用实物展览和印发宣传品等，向群众广泛宣传各种野生植物收购价格、品种、规格质量。各地商业部门还结合当前农副产品的收购高潮，采取出门一齐抓，回来再分家的收购方法。据临沂、菏泽、济宁等五个地区最近的统计，已收购起野生植物油、淀粉、纤维、栲胶等四种原料六百万斤。
    新华社太原17日电　山西省目前有二百万人的专业队和突击队正战斗在深山密林中，采集各种野生植物。晋北地区五台县到10月上旬止，已经采集了木材、小山货、药材、蘑菇、无根菜、野生油料、野生纤维原料、野生酿酒原料等四百九十多种，共一千四百零三万斤。素有宝山之称的太行山区，有三十八万四千多人正在攀山越岭，斩荆披棘，入山取宝，到10月上旬，已采集各种野生植物原料四百二十六万斤。黎城县根据当地野生植物资源集中和分散的情况，订出了长期采集和短期突击的办法，到9月中旬已采集到药材、油料三十一万斤。武乡县把全县划分为四个战区，采集人数达三万人，到9月下旬已采集野生油料、纤维、药材等六十六万斤。
    山西省各级党委加强了对今年野生植物收购工作的领导。9月份以来，中共山西省委连续召开三次电话会议，督促和检查全省农产品和野生植物的收购工作。各地委、县委领导干部亲自领导这一工作，充分发动群众。因此，很快在全省范围内形成了采集野生植物的突击运动。在采集和收购中，太原和晋南专区的临汾等地提出了为工业找原料，为市场找货源，为农民找收入，为生产找资金的口号，很快在全省范围内得到响应。五台县委在这个口号下，紧密结合秋收工作，组织了五万名专业采集队伍，70％以上的商业人员都深入各公社边组织群众采集边收购，调度了70％的运输力，做到了及时的运出加工。
    山西省70％的面积是山区和丘陵地，全省野生植物分布广、产量大、品种多。公社化以后，随着生产规模和经营范围的扩大，给大力培植和采集野生植物创造了有利条件。今年许多公社对野生资源进行了勘查，并抽出劳力突击采集。预计全省今年油料、淀粉、纤维、栲胶等四项野生植物原料的收购量将比去年增长三倍到六倍，收购价值将达五百万元以上。
    本报成都17日电　四川省的商业部门和人民公社，在统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则下，组织千百万人上山，保证做到不错过一刻时机，不漏掉一个品种，采集大批野生植物原料支援城市和工厂。
    今年，四川省各地党委和商业部门，根据野生植物的生产季节不同，本着常年采集、收购和短期突击相结合的精神，1到9月份，已提前完成了全年采购计划，其中，仅野生栲胶原料，就收购了三十二万担，比去年全年收购量增加了一点二倍。八届八中全会以后，商业职工和人民公社社员鼓起更大干劲，利用农闲，又掀起了一个采集和收购高潮。现在，全省已经做到每一个县都有探宝队，社社有探宝员和采购员，既抓大宗产品，又抓小宗产品，力争按品种提前超额完成全年收购计划。
    为充分调动群众积极性，加快野生植物原料的收购进度，做到采得多，收得快，质量好，各地收购部门都订出收购指标和进度，然后把计划落实到公社和生产队。全省重点县之一的忠县，采取这种办法，全县今年前三个季度为国家收购的野生纤维、化工原料、油料、淀粉、药材等已超过去年全年一倍多，公社也增加了收入一百九十六万元。
    商业部门采取边收购、边加工、边调运的方法，目前已将新上市的大批野生植物原料源源运往全省各地和浙江、江西、山东、辽宁各省。这些野生植物原料，都是依靠当地加工厂加工成半成品，然后外运。在运输上，除利用公社专业运输队以外，许多地区采取分站接力运输的办法，利用公社社员工余时间和赶场时捎带运输。梁平县的商业部门，就是依靠群众做到了农副产品和野生植物采购、加工、调运满堂红。
