　　The Birth of the "Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory"
    Not long ago, while the people of our motherland were immersed in festive celebrations, the Kovosit Machine Tool Factory, located in the Tabor district of western Czechoslovakia, was named the "Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory" in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and in commemoration of the friendship between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia.
    We attended this grand naming ceremony.
    Stepping through the gates of the Kovosit factory, we saw a joyful festive scene. Everywhere were Chinese and Czechoslovak flags flying in the wind, and slogans written in both Chinese and Czech, such as "The People's Republic of China in the Great Leap Forward" and "Long Live the Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Czechoslovak Peoples," as well as various posters symbolizing the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples. When the Chinese guests, headed by Ambassador Cao Ying, arrived, the workers who had been waiting at the gate greeted them with enthusiastic handshakes, cordial greetings, and strings of flowers. When Cernik, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, announced at the celebration meeting on behalf of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government that the factory was named the "Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory," warm applause and cheers resounded throughout the venue, and people could not contain their joyful feelings. As Comrade Cernik said, this factory was named according to the wishes and demands of all the factory's employees.
    Compared to many long-established factories in Czechoslovakia, the "Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory" is still young, having been built only twenty years ago. It was established in 1939 during the German fascist rule by the then-shoe king Bata. This large capitalist attempted to exploit cheap labor in this sparsely industrialized area to extract large profits. After liberation, the factory was nationalized, and the workers became the masters of the factory. Production rose sharply, and the lives of the workers also underwent great changes. From 1948 to 1958, production increased by 416%, labor productivity increased by 258%, and the average wage of workers also increased by 158%, while production costs decreased by 66%. This factory produces automated and semi-automated machine tools, 84% of which are exported, currently to fifty countries. In the past eight years, it has produced 616 machine tools for China and has also sent workers and technicians to China to help with construction. Therefore, the friendship between this factory and China has become increasingly deep and lasting.
    Of course, the friendship with the Chinese people is by no means limited to these. Just looking at how enthusiastically the workers of this factory view this naming ceremony is the best explanation. The secretary of the factory's Party committee told us that naming the factory the Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory is a great encouragement to all the workers in the factory. They are all eagerly looking forward to this day. All the workers in the factory have made new guarantees as the best answer to this honor given by the people of China and Czechoslovakia. The factory director, Comrade Josef Novotny, also spoke to us about his feelings about this naming. He said, "We are very grateful to the Central Committee and the Government of the Czechoslovak Communist Party for deciding to name this factory the 'Czechoslovakia-China Friendship Factory.' This is an honor for our entire factory. We are proud that we can concretely embody our friendship with the great Chinese people. We will use better labor to build our country and help the Chinese people. This is the will of our workers."
    When we returned from attending the naming ceremony, our hearts were filled with the friendship of the Czechoslovak working people towards the Chinese people. Dear motherland, as the whole country celebrates the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, in this distant fraternal country, hundreds of thousands of people are also cheering for your increasing prosperity and strength!　Lin Hai

　　“捷中友谊工厂”的诞生
    不久前，当祖国人民正沉浸在节日的狂欢里时，座落在捷克斯洛伐克西部塔波尔县的科沃西特机床制造厂，为了庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年，为了纪念中捷两国人民的友谊，被命名为“捷中友谊工厂”。
    我们参加了这个盛大的命名典礼。
    走进科沃西特工厂的大门，就看到了一片喜气洋洋的节日景象。到处是迎风飘扬的中捷两国的国旗和用中捷两国文字书写的“中华人民共和国在大跃进中”，“捷中人民永恒的友谊万岁”等标语，还有各种标志着中捷人民友谊的招贴画。当以曹瑛大使为首的中国客人们到达后，早就等候在门口的工人们以热情的握手、亲切的问候和成串的鲜花迎接了他们。捷共中央书记切尔尼克代表捷共中央和政府在庆祝大会上宣布这个工厂被命名为“捷中友谊工厂”时，热烈的掌声和欢呼声响彻全场，人们怎样也禁不住他们欢乐的心情。正如切尔尼克同志所说的，这个工厂是按照全厂职工的愿望和要求而被命名的。
    “捷中友谊工厂”比起捷克斯洛伐克许多历史悠久的工厂来说，还是年轻的，它建厂不过二十年，是1939年德国法西斯统治时期由当时的皮鞋大王拔佳所建立的。这个大资本家企图在这个工业稀少的地区，利用廉价的劳动力榨取大量的利润。解放后，工厂收归国有，工人们作了工厂的主人，生产直线上升，工人生活也发生了很大的变化。从1948年到1958年生产提高了416％，劳动生产率提高了258％，工人的平均工资也相应提高了158％，而生产成本却降低了66％。这个工厂出产自动化、半自动化的机床，产品84％都是供出口的，目前它出口到五十个国家。在近八年来，它为中国生产的机床有六百一十六部，还派了工人和技术人员到中国去帮助建设。因此，这个工厂和中国的友谊已是日深月久的了。
    对于中国人民的友谊自然决不仅仅是这些。只要看一看这个工厂的工人是以一种怎样欢欣鼓舞的心情来看待这次命名，就是最好的说明了。这个工厂的党委书记告诉我们，把工厂命名为捷中友谊工厂是对全厂工人的极大的鼓舞，他们都在热情地期待着这一天的到来，全厂的工人都作出了新的保证，以作为中捷两国人民所给予的这分荣誉的最好回答。工厂的厂长约瑟夫·诺沃提尼同志也向我们谈起他对这次命名的感想。他说，我们十分感激捷共中央和政府决定把这个厂命名为“捷中友谊工厂”。这是我们全厂的荣誉。我们为我们能够具体地体现对伟大中国人民的友爱而感到骄傲。我们要以更好的劳动来建设自己的祖国和帮助中国人民，这就是我们工人们的心意。
    当我们参加了命名典礼归来时，我们的心里洋溢着捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对中国人民的友情。亲爱的祖国，当举国欢庆建国十周年的时候，在这个遥远的兄弟之邦里，成千上万的人也正在为你的日益繁荣强盛而欢呼！　林海
