The powerful voice of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism's interference in their internal affairs and in defense of the achievements of the Cuban Revolution is once again resounding throughout the Caribbean region. Angered by the new U.S. imperialist schemes of aggression, people from all walks of life in Cuba held a massive demonstration of a million people in the capital, Havana, on the 26th, protesting the recent economic and political pressure and subversive sabotage activities carried out by the U.S. government against Cuba, and demonstrating their firm determination to support the Cuban revolutionary government and defend the achievements of the Cuban Revolution. The Chinese people, like all peace-loving and just people around the world, express their sincere sympathy and support for this patriotic and just struggle of the Cuban people.

Recently, the United States has taken a series of provocative actions against Cuba, interfering in its internal affairs. The U.S. government openly issued a note to the Cuban government, threatening that if Cuba does not stop implementing land reform, or if it does not compensate the American sugar company bosses for the expropriated land at the highest value and with advance payments, the United States will reduce Cuba's traditional sales quota of cane sugar in the U.S. market. Shortly after this unreasonable demand was resolutely rejected, the United States instigated Major Matos, the former commander of the Camagüey Province forces, a traitor lurking within the Cuban armed forces, to stage an armed rebellion, attempting to once again create a political crisis in Cuba and ignite the flames of civil war. And when this counter-revolutionary plot was discovered in advance and quickly crushed by the Cuban government, the reactionary forces in the United States actually directed Cuban counter-revolutionaries fleeing in the United States to send aircraft from U.S. bases to attack the Cuban capital, distribute reactionary leaflets calling for the overthrow of the Cuban government, and drop bombs and strafe. All of this is a new development in the consistent conspiracy activities of the United States against the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban people since the beginning of this year. The purpose is to obstruct Cuban land reform, undermine the Cuban economy, and sabotage the Cuban Revolution. The U.S. government knows that the influence and impact of the Cuban Revolution far exceeds that of the former democratic government of Guatemala. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is now doing everything possible to obstruct every step forward taken by the Cuban people to consolidate and advance the revolution, and is attempting to ultimately subvert today's Cuban revolutionary government, just as it subverted the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954.

However, the new aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism can only further expose its own hideous face, make the Cuban people more clearly recognize that U.S. imperialism is their most ferocious enemy, and make them more determined to rise up to fight against U.S. aggression and defend the achievements of the revolution. In recent days, the people in various parts of Cuba have widely held marches and demonstrations, and workers in all industries across the country also held a one-hour general strike on October 22 to protest the American air raid on Havana and support the revolutionary government's suppression of the Matos conspiracy group, which attempted to carry out a counter-revolutionary rebellion. The million-person rally held in Havana the day before yesterday once again vividly and powerfully demonstrated the unwavering will of the Cuban people to support the revolutionary government and defend the achievements of the revolution. Under the call of the Cuban revolutionary government, the working people and patriots of Cuba are about to begin military training and implement universal arming to ensure the security of the motherland. Obviously, the Cuban people, who have already stood up, will never be arbitrarily bullied by imperialism, and they are by no means isolated in their struggle. Although the road ahead for the Cuban people is still difficult, and U.S. imperialism will continue to carry out its aggressive schemes in the future, and may even use more despicable and vicious means against Cuba, as long as the Cuban people strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and persevere in their unyielding struggle, then they will certainly be able to overcome one reef after another, just as they have done in the past, and continue to advance victoriously.

The recent new provocative activities of the United States against Cuba once again show that although the U.S. ruling clique has been forced by the situation to say some words hoping for peace and melting the "Cold War" ice, the actual situation is that they are not only provoking civil war in Laos, stepping up the revival of militarism in West Germany and Japan, strengthening military bases and military aggression groups in European and Asian countries, and coercing the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass the provocative resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue," but are now also using new provocations against Cuba to exacerbate the tense situation in the Caribbean region. From these facts, only one conclusion can be drawn, and that is: the U.S. ruling clique has not abandoned its "Cold War" policy and policy of aggression, and all peace-loving people should be highly vigilant about this.

    加勒比海的怒潮
    本报评论员
    古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉内政和保卫古巴革命成果的强大声音，再一次响彻了整个加勒比海地区。被美帝国主义新的侵略阴谋所激怒了的古巴各阶层人民，26日在首都哈瓦那举行了声势浩大的百万群众示威，抗议美国政府最近对古巴进行的经济政治压力和颠覆破坏活动，并显示他们支持古巴革命政府、保卫古巴革命成果的坚强决心。对于古巴人民的这个爱国正义斗争，中国人民同全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人们一样，表示衷心的同情和支持。
    美国最近对古巴采取了一系列干涉古巴内政的挑衅性行动。美国政府公然向古巴政府提出照会，威胁说，如果古巴不停止实行土地改革，或者不向美国糖业公司老板以最高价值和先期付款偿付被征用土地的代价，美国就要减少古巴蔗糖在美国市场上传统的销售定额。在这种无理要求遭到坚决拒绝以后不久，美国又策动潜伏在古巴武装部队内部的叛徒、前卡马圭省部队司令马托斯少校进行武装叛变，企图再一次在古巴国内制造政治危机，燃起内战的烽火。而当这次反革命阴谋被古巴政府预先发现并迅速粉碎之后，美国反动势力竟指使逃亡在美国的古巴反革命分子从美国基地上出动飞机袭击古巴首都，散发号召推翻古巴政府的反动传单，并且投掷炸弹，进行扫射。这一切是美国自从今年年初以来一贯反对古巴革命和古巴人民的阴谋活动的新的发展。其目的是为了阻挠古巴土地改革、打击古巴经济和破坏古巴革命。美国政府知道，古巴革命所产生的影响和作用，远远地超过了过去的危地马拉民主政府。因而美帝国主义现在正千方百计地竭力阻挠古巴人民为了巩固和推进革命的每一步进展，并且企图在最后也像1954年颠覆危地马拉民主政府那样颠覆今天的古巴革命政府。
    但是，美帝国主义的新的侵略阴谋只能进一步暴露它自己的狰狞面目，使古巴人民更加清楚地认识到美帝国主义是他们最凶恶的敌人，使他们更加坚决地起来进行反对美国侵略、保卫革命成果的斗争。连日来，古巴各地的人民群众广泛地举行了游行示威，全国各行业工人也在10月22日举行了一小时的总罢工，抗议来自美国的飞机袭击哈瓦那，支持革命政府镇压企图进行反革命叛乱的马托斯阴谋集团。前天在哈瓦那举行的百万人集会，再一次生动有力地表明古巴全国人民支持革命政府和保卫革命成果的不可动摇的意志。在古巴革命政府的号召下，古巴的劳动人民和爱国人士即将开始军事训练，实行全民武装，来保障祖国的安全。显然，已经站立起来的古巴人民，决不是帝国主义所能任意欺侮的，他们在斗争中也决不是孤立的。虽然，古巴人民前面的道路仍然是艰难的，美帝国主义在今后还会继续施展它的侵略阴谋，甚至可能对古巴施展更加卑鄙狠毒的手段。但是只要古巴人民加强团结，提高警惕，并坚持进行不屈的斗争，那末他们就一定能够像过去那样克服一个又一个的暗礁，继续胜利地前进。
    美国最近对古巴进行的新的挑衅活动，又一次表明美国统治集团虽然为形势所迫，不得不讲了一些希望和平和消融“冷战”冰块的话，但是实际的情况是，他们不但在老挝挑起内战，在西德和日本加紧复活军国主义，在欧亚各国加强军事基地和军事侵略集团，挟持联合国大会非法通过所谓“西藏问题”的挑衅性决议，而且现在又用对古巴的新的挑衅来加剧加勒比海地区的紧张局势。从这些事实中，只能得到一个结论，那就是：美国统治集团并没有放弃它的“冷战”政策和侵略政策，一切爱好和平人民应该对此提高警惕。
