Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th. The call is to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to the level of that of modern large blast furnaces. This is the combat call issued to workers in small-scale iron and steel enterprises across the country by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry at the National Pig Iron Cost Conference held recently in Handan, Hebei.

The meeting held that it is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, and continuously fight against all kinds of right-leaning thoughts, in order to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to the level of large blast furnaces in the shortest possible time.

The conference exchanged experiences, and representatives from many small iron and steel plants used vivid facts to illustrate that it is entirely possible to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to the level of large blast furnaces. Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant in Sichuan Province is a small iron and steel plant built in high mountains and steep ridges. The largest blast furnace has a volume of only thirty-three cubic meters, and the conditions for ore and transportation are very poor. However, under the leadership of the Party, the plant boldly mobilized the masses and carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, making some technical improvements to transportation tools and small blast furnaces, so that the output and quality of pig iron have risen steadily, and the cost has been greatly reduced. By July, the average cost of pig iron per ton in the whole plant was only 96.54 yuan, reaching the level of modern large blast furnace pig iron costs. Workers at the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant in Guizhou Province promoted advanced iron-smelting experience in all six small blast furnaces in the plant and improved the production management system, so that the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces reached 1.3 since the second quarter, and the average cost of pig iron per ton was reduced to 84.77 yuan, reaching the lowest level of large blast furnace pig iron costs in the country.

The representatives unanimously guaranteed that they would reduce the average cost of pig iron per ton in small blast furnaces across the country to below 250 yuan in the fourth quarter of this year, and strive to reduce it to below 150 yuan in 1960, close to the current level of large blast furnace pig iron costs.

In order to realize this leap forward target, the meeting formulated eight measures: (1) Strengthen technical management; (2) Strengthen raw material management; (3) Vigorously reduce the coke ratio; (4) Improve transportation conditions inside and outside the factory; (5) Rectify labor organization; (6) Strengthen enterprise management; (7) Promote economic accounting; (8) It is recommended that areas with suitable conditions should form small joint enterprises including mining and coking workshops as much as possible.

At the meeting, the four iron-smelting plants of Wanfu, Huaguoshan, Tashi, and Weiyuan in Sichuan Province proposed to the small blast furnace workers across the country to launch a competition to drastically reduce pig iron costs, and the representatives of various provinces and iron-smelting plants present enthusiastically responded to this friendly challenge. The three small blast furnaces (two with a volume of eight cubic meters and one with a volume of three cubic meters) of Wanfu, Shuicheng, and Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plants jointly proposed a friendly competition to reduce pig iron costs to large blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.

    大幅度降低小高炉生铁成本
    全国小高炉职工代表决心同大高炉比高低
    据新华社天津6日电　叫小高炉的生铁成本降低到现代化大高炉生铁成本的水平。这是冶金工业部最近在河北邯郸召开的全国小高炉生铁成本会议，向全国小型钢铁企业的职工发出的战斗号召。
    会议认为，必须坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，不断地同形形色色的右倾思想作斗争，才能在最短时期内使小高炉生铁成本降低到大型高炉生铁成本的水平。
    大会交流了经验，许多小型钢铁厂的代表用生动的事实说明把小高炉生铁成本降到大型高炉生铁成本水平是完全可能的。四川省万福钢铁厂是建设在高山峻岭中的一座小钢铁厂，最大的高炉的容积只有三十三立方米，矿石和运输条件都很差。但是，这个厂在党的领导下，放手发动群众，大搞技术革新与技术革命，对运输工具和小高炉进行了一些技术改造，使生铁产量、质量节节上升，成本大大下降。到7月份，全厂平均每吨生铁成本只有九十六点五四元，达到了现代化大型高炉生铁成本的水平。贵州省水城钢铁厂职工，在全厂六座小高炉上推广先进炼铁经验，健全了生产管理制度，使小高炉的平均利用系数从第二季度以来达到了一点三，平均每吨生铁成本降到八十四点七七元，达到了全国大型高炉生铁成本最低的水平。
    代表们一致保证，要在今年第四季度使全国小高炉每吨生铁的平均成本降低到二百五十元以下，力争在1960年降低到一百五十元以下，接近目前大型高炉生铁成本的水平。
    为了实现这个跃进指标，会议制订出八项措施：（1）加强技术管理；（2）加强原料材料管理；（3）大力降低焦比；（4）改善厂内外运输状况；（5）整顿劳动组织；（6）加强企业管理；（7）推行经济核算；（8）建议有条件的地区尽量把小型炼铁厂组成包括采矿、炼焦等车间的小型联合企业。
    在会议上，四川省万福、花果山、沓水、威远四个炼铁厂，向全国小高炉职工提出开展大幅度降低生铁成本竞赛的倡议，到会的各省、各炼铁厂的代表热烈响应了这一友谊的挑战。四川万福、贵州水城和马鞍山三个钢铁厂的三个小高炉（容积八立方米的两座，三立方米的一座），联名向武汉钢铁公司，石景山钢铁公司的大型高炉提出降低生铁成本的友谊竞赛。
