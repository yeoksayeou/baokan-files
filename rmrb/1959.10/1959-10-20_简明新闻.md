Brief News

　　Kazakh Herdsmen Settle Down
　　In the Altay region of Xinjiang, thirty people's communes have enabled more than 80,000 Kazakh herdsmen to end their nomadic tent life and move into warm and comfortable new homes this winter, within less than a year of their establishment.
　　Each people's commune, taking the production team as a unit, began the construction of new settlements during production gaps starting this spring. There are about 150 newly built and expanded settlements for herdsmen in the entire region. Qinghe County, which previously had a poor foundation for settlement, has seen the emergence of nine new settlements with more than 200 households each since communization. These settlements are built near farmland or in the center of pastures, and each member's house also has a dairy farm and a small vegetable plot. The new villages generally have canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, schools, shops, health centers, and iron and wood factories, and agricultural and livestock product processing plants.
　　Handan Region Harvesting Sweet Potatoes
　　The 1.49 million mu of sweet potatoes in Handan Region, Hebei Province, are generally growing well and are now being harvested. As of October 9, more than 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been harvested throughout the region.
　　In order to ensure a clean and good harvest, the communes have implemented a production responsibility system to guarantee the quality of the harvesting work.
　　Picking Wild Plants
　　Wild plants in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia are a scene of abundant harvest, with yellow, red, purple and green colors. Members of people's communes, students, and workers of all ethnic groups have gone to the mountains to collect daylilies, mushrooms, wood ear fungus, various wild fruits, and medicinal materials. As of the beginning of October, Xiguitu Banner (meaning "forest area" in Mongolian) alone has purchased more than 357,000 jin of daylilies, mushrooms, wild fruits, and medicinal materials.
