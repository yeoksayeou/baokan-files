　　Seize the Golden Season for Construction to Create Conditions for the Great Leap Forward Next Spring
    Beijing Infrastructure Workers Launch Autumn Battle
    Goal: Open Up 1.6 Million Square Meters of New Battlefields, Complete 800,000 Square Meters of New Projects
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Zhou Dingfang) After achieving great victories in August and September, the 150,000 infrastructure workers in Beijing are launching an autumn battle centered on industrial infrastructure, striving to have a construction area of 1.6 million square meters by November 20th, and a completed area of 800,000 square meters in the fourth quarter, to create a favorable situation for the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial production and infrastructure construction this winter and next spring.

    In the fourth quarter of this year, the construction area in Beijing will reach approximately three million square meters, an increase of more than 200,000 square meters compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which had the highest construction area since liberation. Such a large construction scale is rare in Beijing's construction history. This is the result of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production and infrastructure construction in the first nine months of this year. From January to September this year, more than half of the projects in the infrastructure construction front have been completed and put into use or into production, due to the implementation of the principle of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. Now that the construction forces have been assembled and the construction tasks in various fields urgently require early construction, it is possible and necessary to open up a large number of new battlefields to create conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward in infrastructure construction this winter and throughout next year. The dozens of industrial projects under construction in the fourth quarter include the Beijing Bearing Factory, the second phase of the Beijing Coking Chemical Plant, the Beijing Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, the Beijing Printing and Dyeing Factory, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the new and expanded projects of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. These important projects, when put into production successively this year and next year, will further change the industrial landscape of the capital.

    Although the infrastructure construction tasks in Beijing in the fourth quarter are very heavy, the situation is also very favorable. The workers, after being tempered by the Ten Great Projects such as the People's Great Hall and the Beijing Railway Station, and the large-scale industrial construction of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, have figured out a set of construction experiences from project scheduling, formulating phased construction plans, concentrating superior forces for key assaults, to organizing final sprint battles for completion, and have improved their leadership level, technical level, and the combat capabilities of the teams. Secondly, it is currently a good season for construction, with the rainy season over and winter yet to arrive. More importantly, since the beginning of autumn, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers have been full of energy and high spirits. Many leading cadres of construction enterprises have also set up camps on the site, living, eating, and working with the workers, so the project is progressing rapidly. The cadres at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory originally planned to spend one hundred days to build a heavy and super-heavy workshop with an area equivalent to six football fields. At that time, some people thought it impossible to complete. After careful calculation, the workers felt that the construction period was too long and shortened it to sixty days. As a result, it only took twenty-seven days. After inspection, the hoisting and welding quality was good. People who originally had right-leaning thoughts were amazed at this unprecedented construction speed.

    With the further implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the entire city's infrastructure construction front, from top to bottom and from cadres to the masses, has become even higher. After airing their views and debates, the workers have formulated the fourth quarter's leap forward plans and specific measures. These measures can be summarized into six points: 1. Adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements and combining them with centralized leadership, boosting greater enthusiasm, and trying every means to solve the difficulties of labor, materials, and machinery and tools. 2. For all projects, according to the conditions of drawings, materials, and site preparation, with industrial construction as the center, uniformly arrange the phased commencement and completion plans. 3. On the premise of ensuring quality, vigorously carry out mass rapid construction movements and fight quick battles to achieve quick victories. 4. Establish a unified command headquarters with the design, construction, and construction departments and other units related to each project, unite and cooperate under centralized leadership, fight together, oppose departmentalism, and promote the communist style. 5. Leading cadres go to the front line to direct production, closely monitor inspections, and promptly solve problems when they are discovered. 6. Strengthen the combination of political work and the implementation of the reward system, improve enterprise management, vigorously promote technological revolution, fully tap potential, and improve labor productivity.

    In order to win this great battle, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened a city-wide infrastructure construction cadre meeting on the 13th and 15th to deploy the combat steps for the fourth quarter: the first battle will be before the ground freezes on November 20th, with the goal of focusing on commencement and completing the commencement plan with a concentrated effort, while ensuring the smooth construction of key projects. The second battle will be from November 20th to the end of the year, mainly to engage in winter construction, to ensure the completion of 800,000 square meters and to exceed this target. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the infrastructure construction workers to continue to oppose right-leaning ideas and encourage enthusiasm, vigorously carry out mass movements, and comprehensively complete the infrastructure construction tasks with high output, high quality, high efficiency, safety, and low cost, based on the successful experience gained in the great battles of August and September.

    Currently, an even greater leap forward upsurge has formed on more than two hundred construction sites throughout the city. The workers are adopting various forms of competition, striving to fight another beautiful battle in seventy-five days. (Attached photo)

### 抓紧施工黄金季节为明春大跃进创造条件  北京基建职工展开秋季大战  目标：开辟一百六十万平方米新战场，完成八十万平方米新工程

　　抓紧施工黄金季节为明春大跃进创造条件
    北京基建职工展开秋季大战
    目标：开辟一百六十万平方米新战场，完成八十万平方米新工程
    本报讯　记者周定舫报道：北京基本建设战线十五万职工在8、9两月取得了巨大胜利以后，正在掀起一个以工业基本建设为中心的秋季大战，力争11月20日以前开工面积达一百六十万平方米，在四季度内竣工面积达八十万平方米，为今冬明春工业生产和基本建设的大跃进创造有利的形势。
    今年第四季度，北京同时施工的建筑面积将要达到三百万平方米左右，比解放以来施工面积最高的去年第四季度，又扩大了二十多万平方米。这样大的施工规模，在北京的建筑史上是少有的。这是今年前九个月工业生产和基本建设大跃进的结果。今年1至9月份，在基本建设战线上，由于执行了集中优势力量打歼灭战的方针，已有二分之一以上的工程竣工交付使用或投入生产。现在施工力量已经集结起来，各方面的建设任务又迫切要求早日兴建。因此，有条件也有必要开辟大批新的战场，为基本建设今年冬季和明年全年的继续大跃进创造条件。今年第四季度施工的几十个工业项目中，有北京轴承厂、北京炼焦化学厂二期工程、北京第四棉纺织厂、北京印染厂、北京农业机械厂和长辛店机车车辆工厂等新建扩建工程。这些重要工程在今年、明年陆续投入生产后，将进一步改变首都的工业面貌。
    第四季度北京基本建设任务虽然十分繁重，但形势也十分有利。职工们经过人民大会堂、北京车站等十大工程和石景山钢铁公司、北京第一机床厂等规模巨大的工业建设的锻炼，摸出了从项目排队、制定分期分批施工计划、集中优势兵力重点突击到组织扫尾竣工突击战的一套施工经验，提高了领导水平、技术水平和队组的战斗能力。其次，目前正是施工的大好季节，雨季已过，冬季尚未来临。更为重要的是，入秋以来，职工们在党的八届八中全会的号召下，个个干劲冲天，人人意气风发。许多建筑企业的领导干部也在现场上安营扎寨，和工人们同吃同住同劳动，因此，工程进展很快。北京第一机床厂工地的干部们原先计划用一百天时间，建成一座面积足足有六个足球场那么大的重型超重型车间。当时，有人认为不可能建成。而工人群众经过仔细算账后，还嫌工期太长，又缩短到六十天。结果，只用了二十七天。经过检查，吊装、焊接质量良好。原来有右倾思想的人，面对这一空前未有的建设速度惊叹不已。
    随着党的八届八中全会决议的进一步贯彻，全市基本建设战线从上到下、从干部到群众的热情更加高涨。职工们经过鸣放、辩论，纷纷制定第四季度的跃进计划和具体措施。这些措施归纳起来有六项：一、坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动和集中领导相结合的方针，鼓起更大的干劲，千方百计解决劳动力、材料和机械工具的困难。二、对所有工程，都要根据图纸、材料、现场准备等条件，以工业建设为中心，统一安排分期、分批开工和竣工的计划。三、在保证质量的前提下，大搞群众性的快速施工运动，速战速决。四、与各个工程项目有关的设计、施工、建设部门等单位，成立统一指挥部，在集中领导下，同心协力，共同奋战，反对本位主义，提倡共产主义风格。五、领导干部亲临前线指挥生产，抓紧检查，发现问题及时解决。六、加强政治工作与推行奖励制度相结合，改进企业管理，大闹技术革命，充分挖掘潜力，提高劳动生产率。
    为了打赢这场大战，中共北京市委在13、15两天，接连召开全市基本建设干部大会，布置第四季度的作战步骤：11月20日上冻以前为第一战役，在保证重点工程顺利建设的条件下，大抓开工，突击完成开工计划。11月20日到年底为第二战役，主要是大搞冬季施工，保证完成和超额完成八十万平方米的竣工计划。中共北京市委号召基本建设的职工根据大战8、9两月取得的成功经验，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，做到高产、优质、高效率、安全、低成本全面地完成基本建设任务。
    目前，更大的跃进高潮已在全市二百多个工地上形成。工人们正在采取各种竞赛形式，力争在七十五天内，再打一个漂亮仗。（附图片）
