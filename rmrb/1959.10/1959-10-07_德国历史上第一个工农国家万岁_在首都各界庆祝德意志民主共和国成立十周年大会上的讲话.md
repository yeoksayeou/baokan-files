    Long Live the First Worker-Peasant State in German History
    Speech at the Rally of All Circles in the Capital Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the
    German Democratic Republic
    Hermann Matern, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
    of
    the German United Socialist Party, First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Head of the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic
    Respected Chairman, Respected Comrades Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrades and Friends!
    Please allow me to express my most heartfelt gratitude for your warm reception and for the friendly welcoming speech that Comrade Zhu De just delivered to us.
    It is an unforgettable event for the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to be able to participate in the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The rapid development, strength, and powerful unity of the People's Republic of China have left us with an extremely deep impression. We are pleased to learn of the tremendous construction achievements you have made in the past ten years. In these ten years, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful socialist country, and China has won international respect and admiration in the Far East and throughout the world as a courageous defender of peace. Thanks to the wise policies of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the fighting will and unity of hundreds of millions of people, a powerful China has victoriously smashed all attempts by imperialism to hinder its victorious advance towards socialism, and will continue to smash all of them. The people of the German Democratic Republic are extremely pleased to welcome the achievements of the People's Republic of China. They regard these achievements as their own achievements as well, because due to the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, due to the common struggle for peace and socialism, the German people and the Chinese people, and the Chinese workers and peasants, are closely united, united like two brothers.
    We are brothers of the same year. The Chinese people celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China a week ago, and tomorrow, the people of the German Democratic Republic will also celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of their own republic with extreme pride.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in German history, was not easy. It involved more than sixty years of arduous struggle against the robber German militarism and imperialism, which caused the sacrifice of tens of thousands of people from the working class and other patriotic and peace-loving forces, including some heroic fighters such as Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Ernst Thälmann, and other prominent cadres in the German and international revolutionary workers' movement.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic was possible as a result of the heroic Soviet army's world-historic victory over fascist rule. This opened up a path for Germany to develop in a new, democratic, and anti-fascist direction. The working class, as a great national force, was able to fulfill its historical task, namely, to guide the masses of the people onto a path to rebuild Germany into a peaceful, democratic country; in one part of Germany, to realize the world-changing ideal of the great sons of the German people, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, to establish a social system that forever eliminates exploitation and oppression.
    The workers can accomplish this task in the German Democratic Republic because they have learned lessons from the past, from the two world wars, because after the Communists and Social Democrats merged into the United Socialist Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, they mobilized all anti-fascist and patriotic forces shoulder to shoulder, firmly united, and resolutely eliminated the economic and political foundations of imperialism.
    Because the imperialist occupying powers and the former German imperialist forces made West Germany increasingly a fortress against democratic development in all of Germany and Europe. The divided state of West Germany, established in September 1949 by undermining the Potsdam Agreement and thus violating international law and the interests of all peace-loving people, became a chasm across Germany, aimed at hindering Germany's democratic development.
    But the enemies of the German people, domestic and foreign imperialists, miscalculated Germany's development, just as the enemies miscalculated the development of the Far East, the development of the People's Republic of China. A small handful of millionaires can no longer stop the wheels of history from advancing towards socialism, driven by millions of workers and peasants.
    On the basis of the rapid development of the public ownership of the most important means of production, due to the nationalization of important economic lifelines, due to the hard work of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in our country, due to the correct leadership of the working-class party, due to the correct policies of the government of the German Democratic Republic, and due to the fraternal assistance and support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the working people of our country have achieved tremendous achievements in consolidating their own country, in political, economic, and cultural aspects.
    The goals of the first two-year plan were completed ahead of schedule. The pre-war level of industrial production was already exceeded in 1950. On the basis of the successful implementation of the first five-year plan proposed in 1950, we were able to make a resolution at the Second Party Congress in 1952 to systematically build the foundations of socialism. This resolution mobilized new productive enthusiasm among the working people and achieved new achievements in all aspects of social life.
    Thanks to the completion of the goals of the first five-year plan, the foundations of socialism have been established in a wide range of areas of the Republic.
    Industrial production has doubled compared to pre-war levels, and our country has become the fifth industrial power in Europe.
    The German Democratic Republic, as a firm component of the socialist camp in the westernmost part of Europe, has become an important bastion of peace in Europe, and has gained increasing international prestige in the struggle to consolidate peace and oppose the forces of German and foreign imperialism.
    Today, our republic has become an indisputable fact that people can neither deny nor ignore, and even less can they eliminate it. It is developing and prospering.
    Last July, the Fifth Congress of the German United Socialist Party was able to point out that industrial production has increased threefold compared to the year the Republic was founded, the sales volume of Germany's foreign and domestic trade has increased threefold compared to 1950, and industrial labor productivity has more than doubled.
    On this basis, we have been able to put forward the main economic task at the Fifth Party Congress as a concrete battle program, that is, to raise our national economy to such a level that within a few years it will clearly prove that the socialist social system of the German Democratic Republic is superior to the rule of the imperialist forces in West Germany. This main economic task will enable our working people to catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of most industrial consumer goods and food by 1961. In this way, the German Democratic Republic will become an increasingly attractive example for all of Germany to learn from.
    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German United Socialist Party correctly wrote in the outline on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic:
    "The German Democratic Republic is a base and model for solving the immediate problems of the German nation. Therefore, the completion of the main economic task has the greatest national significance. It is directly aimed at the plans of the West German imperialists and militarists, who want to complete the atomic armament of the West German army in 1961. The working people of the German Democratic Republic fully and clearly demonstrate the superiority of socialism, continuously improve the people's living standards, and will also strengthen all forces in West Germany that are striving for peace and democratic reunification. This will finally force West Germany to change its policies. Therefore, any contribution to solving the main economic task helps to safeguard peace and the revival of the German nation. It is fully in line with the political, economic, and social interests of the people of our republic and all the German people.
    From this, it can be seen that the main economic task has profound political content and helps to consolidate the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic and the entire socialist camp. Solving this task is our republic's contribution to the great historical struggle that determines our era—the peaceful competition between the socialist and capitalist social systems."
    Not long ago, the Sixth Plenary Session of our Party Central Committee adopted a seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. This plan has been approved by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic at its meeting from September 30 to October 1.
    This seven-year plan will guarantee the completion of the main economic task. It is a plan for developing socialist construction, and its goal is to achieve the comprehensive victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic by 1965. This plan expects to increase production fourfold compared to 1936, and to double the current industrial production. The German Democratic Republic will make a significant contribution to the common goal of all socialist countries to catch up with and surpass capitalist countries in total production by 1965 with this plan.
    Dear Comrades and Friends!
    I can assure you that the workers and peasants of our country fully recognize this important responsibility and will take corresponding actions.
    In our country, the working people are fighting to dedicate gifts to their country's glorious festival, to complete the tasks ahead of schedule victoriously, and to complete 80% of the annual plan by the tenth anniversary of the National Day, and they have achieved this goal. Not only that, but due to the heroic achievements of our working people, the total production target originally scheduled to be completed in 1960 will be completed ahead of schedule at the end of this year. The reason why our working people can do this is primarily because socialist collaboration has developed in various work teams, workshops, enterprises, and entire industrial sectors. This proves that by socialist labor collectives are not merely simply aggregating all the forces together, but creating a new and very effective force that can move mountains and overturn seas. While our working people continue to build socialism effectively, German imperialism and militarism are implementing their reactionary policies that threaten peace not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world. The active participation of West German monopoly capitalists and militarists in France's preparation for nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara is an eloquent proof of this.
    The German Democratic Republic uses a peaceful foreign policy aimed at friendship and cooperation among all nations to oppose the dangerous imperialist policies. This is yet another proof that the goals and methods of the policies of the two Germanys are fundamentally different.
    This was manifested at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was clearly visible to the whole world. At the conference, the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet delegation jointly represented the peace policy of the German Democratic Republic.
    The fundamental difference between the two German foreign policies is also reflected in their attitude towards China. West Germany is still unwilling to recognize the historical fact that only the People's Republic of China represents all the Chinese people, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The German Democratic Republic, on the contrary, has forged a strong fraternal friendship between its people and the People's Republic of China, and its 650 million people.
    Since the establishment of our two countries in 1949, the noble principles of proletarian internationalism and the common goal of building socialism have established a solid foundation for the development of our two countries' state relations. This relationship is fundamentally different in content and form from the relationship between the original German imperialism and old China before 1945. For ten years, we have continuously developed and consolidated this relationship, which is beneficial to our two countries. This is manifested in the political support we have given each other in all basic policy issues.
    I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Chinese people for the effective assistance you have often given to the German Democratic Republic. In particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the support given in the struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, to resolve the West Berlin issue, and in some other issues before and after the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it will regard any attack by imperialist countries on the German Democratic Republic as an attack on the entire socialist camp, and will fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such attacks. Our people regard this as a great moral and political encouragement in the fierce struggle against imperialist warmongers on the borders of the German Democratic Republic.
    Whether it was Prime Minister Grotewohl or myself, as First Deputy Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, during our visits in January and May this year, the friendly feelings of the Chinese working people towards our people left us with unforgettable impressions. I believe that the Party and Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic and the delegation of the Sino-German Friendship Association, and the delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China that we are looking forward to, will personally see the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic during their visit, and return to People's China with the same warm impressions as we did when we returned to our homeland.
    In the economic field, the relations between our two countries have also developed rapidly. Trade with the People's Republic of China is of great significance for the completion of our main economic tasks that have already been mentioned, and in general, there is still potential for further development of our future cooperation in the economic field.
    We are pleased that the working people of our country have been able to help you build several important factories in the first and second five-year plans, some of which have been completed and some of which are under construction. Our experts can also effectively help with the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China.
    Currently, all the people of the German Democratic Republic are watching with great concern the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We congratulate you on the great achievements you have made in the Leap Forward year. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leader Mao Zedong, all the Chinese people will go all out and achieve even greater achievements than in the first half of the year. The call put forward by the Party and the government that the high targets set by the second five-year plan should be completed three years ahead of schedule is of great significance not only for the People's Republic of China itself, but also for the entire socialist camp. This is another proof that the socialist social system is superior to the decadent imperialist world.
    The people's communes in your country have also fully demonstrated their vitality and right to exist. We have seen with great interest another vivid proof of this, namely, the achievements made by the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing in conquering natural disasters and in the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn.
    The people's commune means enough to eat and a better life for millions of peasants. Despite all the slander, this example is becoming an increasingly attractive force for the people of Asia, especially the millions of peasant masses.
    Of course, there will be local and temporary difficulties in solving such a great task. This is the case in the People's Republic of China, undeniably, and it is also the case in the German Democratic Republic in the struggle to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress. There are also people here, even in our own ranks, who think that we are developing too fast. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China gave these people the correct answer. The enthusiasm and work results of the Chinese people, and the total achievements to be made by the end of this year, are a good lesson for pessimists and skeptics.
    The people of our two countries, based on the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, closely united in unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation, are moving forward along the socialist road. Neither the clamor of imperialism nor any conspiracy or sabotage can prevent us from completing our historical tasks in the East and the West.
    Long live the friendship between the people of Germany and China!
    Long live the leadership of the Chinese working people, the Communist Party of China, which has been tested in struggle!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

    德国历史上第一个工农国家万岁
    在首都各界庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十周年大会上的讲话
    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团第一副主席德意志民主共和国党政代表团团长  赫·马特恩敬爱的主席同志，尊敬的朱德、周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    请允许我对你们热忱的接待以及刚才朱德同志对我们表示欢迎的友好讲话致以最衷心的感谢。
    能够参加中华人民共和国建国十周年国庆大典，这对德意志民主共和国党政代表团来说是一件难忘的大事。中华人民共和国的飞速发展、强大与团结的有力表现，给我们留下了极其深刻的印象。我们愉快地了解到你们十年来所取得的巨大建设成就。在这十年中，中华人民共和国成了一个强大的社会主义大国，中国在远东和全世界作为勇敢的和平保卫者赢得了国际上的尊重与钦佩。由于中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的英明政策，由于亿万人民的战斗意志和团结一致，强大的中国胜利地粉碎了帝国主义阻挠它向社会主义胜利进军的一切企图，并将继续粉碎这一切。德意志民主共和国的人民极其愉快地欢迎中华人民共和国的成就。他们把这些成就也看作是自己的成就，因为由于马克思列宁主义的共同思想，由于为和平与社会主义的共同斗争，德国人民和中国人民，和中国的工人与农民是紧密地团结在一起的，团结得像是两个兄弟一样。
    我们是同年的兄弟，中国人民在一周前庆祝了中华人民共和国建国十周年，而明天，德意志民主共和国的人民也要以极其自豪的心情庆祝自己共和国建国十周年。
    德意志民主共和国，德国历史上的第一个工农国家的建立是不容易的，它进行了六十多年的反对强盗的德国军国主义和帝国主义的艰苦斗争，军国主义和帝国主义使工人阶级和其他爱国的以及爱好和平的力量牺牲了成千上万的人，其中还有一些英勇的战士如卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、恩斯特·台尔曼及德国和国际革命工人运动中的其他著名干部。
    德意志民主共和国的成立之所以可能是由于英雄的苏联军队战胜了法西斯统治取得了世界历史性胜利的结果。这就给德国开辟了一条向新的，民主的，反法西斯方向发展的道路。工人阶级作为伟大的民族力量，能够完成它的历史任务，即把人民群众引导走上一条把德国重建为一个和平、民主国家的道路；在德国的一部分实现德国人民伟大的儿子卡尔·马克思、佛里德利希·恩格斯建立一个永远消除剥削与压迫的社会制度的改变世界的理想。
    工人们可以在德意志民主共和国完成这一任务，因为他们从过去，从两次世界大战中吸取了教训，因为共产党人、社会民主党人在马克思列宁主义的基础上合并为统一社会党以后，肩并肩地动员了一切反法西斯和爱国的力量，牢固地团结一致，坚决地消灭了帝国主义的经济和政治基础。
    由于帝国主义占领国和原来的德国帝国主义势力使西德越来越成为全德和欧洲反对民主发展的堡垒。用破坏波茨坦协定从而违反国际法，违反所有爱好和平人民的利益而在1949年9月建立的西德分裂国家成了一道横贯德国的鸿沟，其目的在于阻碍德国的民主发展。
    但是德国人民的敌人，本国和外国帝国主义者对德国的发展打错了算盘，正如敌人对远东的发展，对中华人民共和国的发展打错了算盘一样。一小撮百万富翁再也不能阻拦由千百万工人和农民所推动的向社会主义前进的历史车轮。
    在最重要的生产资料全民所有制迅速发展的基础上，由于重要经济命脉的国有化，由于我国千百万工人农民和知识分子努力和艰苦的劳动，由于工人阶级政党的正确领导，由于德意志民主共和国政府的正确政策，苏联和人民民主国家兄弟般的援助和支持才使我国劳动人民在巩固自己的国家时，在政治，经济和文化方面取得了巨大的成就。
    第一个两年计划的目标提前完成了。1950年已经超过了战前的工业生产水平。在顺利地执行1950年所提出的第一个五年计划的基础上，我们可以在1952年第二次党代表会议上作出有计划的建设社会主义基础的决议，这一决议动员了劳动人民新的生产干劲并在社会生活的各方面取得了新的成就。
    由于完成了第一个五年计划的目标，因而在共和国的广大范围内建立了社会主义的基础。
    工业生产与战前比较增加了一倍，我国在欧洲成为第五个工业强国。
    德意志民主共和国作为社会主义阵营最西方的牢固组成部分，成为欧洲和平的重要堡垒，在为巩固和平、反对德国和外国帝国主义势力的斗争中获得了越来越高的国际威望。
    今天我们共和国已成为一个无庸争辩的事实，人们既不能否认也不能忽视这一点，人们更不能消灭它，它在发展、在繁荣。
    去年7月，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会能够指出，与共和国成立的那一年相比，工业生产增加了两倍，德国对外和国内贸易的销售额与1950年相比增加了三倍，工业劳动生产率增加了一倍多。
    在这种基础上，我们有可能在第五次党代表大会上把主要经济任务作为具体的战斗纲领提出，即把我们的国民经济提高到这样的水平，在几年内清楚地证明德意志民主共和国社会主义社会制度比西德帝国主义势力的统治优越。这一主要经济任务将使我们的劳动人民能够在大多数工业消费品和食品的消费量方面，按人口计算在1961年赶上和超过西德。德意志民主共和国将以这种方式更加强烈地成为对全德具有吸引力的学习榜样。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局在关于德意志民主共和国成立十周年的提纲中正确地写道：
    “德意志民主共和国是解决德意志民族切身问题的基地和典范。因此完成主要经济任务具有最大的民族意义，它是直接针对西德帝国主义者和军国主义者的计划的，他们要在1961年完成西德军队的原子武装。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民全面清楚地证明社会主义的优越性，不断地提高人民生活水平，也会增强西德所有为和平和民主恢复统一的力量。这就会最后迫使西德改变政策。因此，任何对解决主要经济任务的贡献都有助于保障和平和德国民族的复兴。它完全符合我们共和国人民和全体德国人民的政治、经济和社会利益。
    由此可见，主要经济任务具有深刻的政治内容，有助于巩固德意志民主共和国的工农政权和整个社会主义阵营。解决这个任务是我们共和国对决定我们时代的伟大历史性斗争——社会主义和资本主义社会制度之间的和平竞赛——的贡献。”
    不久前，我们党中央委员会第六次全会通过了发展德意志民主共和国国民经济的七年计划。这一计划已由德意志民主共和国人民议院在9月30日到10月1日的会议上批准。
    这个七年计划将保证主要经济任务的完成，它是发展社会主义建设的计划，它的目标是到1965年时使社会主义在德意志民主共和国取得全面的胜利。这一计划预计要把生产和1936年相比提高四倍，把目前的工业生产翻一番。德意志民主共和国将以这一计划对所有社会主义国家的到1965年在总生产上赶上和超过资本主义国家的共同目标作出重大贡献。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我可以向你们保证，我国的工人和农民完全充分地认识到这一重大责任并要采取相应的行动。
    在我国，劳动人民为向自己国家的光荣节日献礼，为了胜利地提前完成任务，为在十周年国庆时完成年度计划的80％而战斗着，他们达到了这一目标。不仅如此，由于我们的劳动人民的英雄成就，本来预定到1960年完成的总生产目标将提前在今年年底完成。我国劳动人民所以能够这样，首先是由于各工作队、各车间、各企业和整个工业部门发展了社会主义的协作。这里证明，通过社会主义劳动集体不是仅仅把所有的力量简单地聚合在一起，而是建立了一种新的非常有效的能够移山倒海的力量。当我国劳动人民卓有成效地继续建设着社会主义时，德国帝国主义和军国主义不仅在欧洲，同时也在世界的其他部分执行其威胁和平的反动政策。西德垄断资本家和军国主义者积极参与法国在撒哈拉准备原子武器试验这一点就是一个雄辩的证明。
    德意志民主共和国用旨在各民族友好与合作的爱好和平的外交政策来反对危险的帝国主义政策，这又是两个德国政策的目标与方法有着根本不同的又一证明。
    这一点在日内瓦外长会议上得到了表现，这是全世界都看得清清楚楚的，在会上，德意志民主共和国政府代表团和苏联代表共同代表着德意志民主共和国的和平政策。
    两个德国外交政策的根本不同也表现在对待中国的态度上。西德仍然不愿承认这一历史事实，即只有中华人民共和国是全体中国人民的代表，台湾则是中国不可分割的组成部分。德意志民主共和国则与此相反，它的人民和中华人民共和国，和其六亿五千万人民结成了牢固的兄弟般的友谊。
    1949年，我们两国成立以后，崇高的无产阶级国际主义原则和建设社会主义的共同目标为我们两国的国家关系的发展建立了牢固的基础。这种关系从内容和形式上根本区别于原德国帝国主义和旧中国在1945年以前的关系。十年来我们不断地发展并巩固了有益于我们两国的这种关系。这表现在我们在所有基本的政策问题上，相互间进行了政治上的支持。
    我想利用这个机会向全中国人民，对你们经常给予德意志民主共和国的有效援助表示感谢。特别是对为缔结对德和约的斗争，解决西柏林问题以及日内瓦外长会议前后的一些其他问题上所给予的支持表示感谢。
    中国政府一再声明它将把帝国主义国家对德意志民主共和国的任何进攻都看作是对整个社会主义阵营的进攻，并将全力支持德意志民主共和国击退这种进攻。我国人民把这看作是在德意志民主共和国的边境反对帝国主义战争贩子激烈斗争中的一种伟大的道义上和政治上的鼓舞。
    无论是格罗提渥总理，或是我个人作为德意志民主共和国人民议院第一副主席，在今年1月和5月的访问期间，中国劳动人民对我国人民的友好感情都给我们留下了难忘的印象。我相信，中华人民共和国庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十周年的党政代表团和中德友协代表团和我们期待着的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团在访问期间将会亲眼看到德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设，并像我们回到自己的祖国一样，带着同样热烈的印象回到人民中国。
    在经济方面，我们两国的关系也有着飞速的发展，和中华人民共和国的贸易对于完成对前面已经谈到过的我们的主要经济任务来说有着重大的意义，总的说来在经济上，对于我们今后合作的继续发展还有潜力可挖。
    我们感到高兴，我国的劳动人民能够帮助你们建设第一个和第二个五年计划中的若干重要工厂，这些有的已经建成，有的正在建设。我们的专家也能卓有成效地对中华人民共和国的社会主义建设进行帮助。
    目前，德意志民主共和国的全体人民以极大的关怀注视着中国共产党中央委员会八届八中全会决议的实现，我们祝贺你们在跃进年中所取得的巨大成就，我们相信，全中国人民在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的正确领导下，将鼓足干劲，取得比上半年更大的成就。党和政府所提出的第二个五年计划所规定的很高的指标在今年提前三年完成的号召，不仅对中华人民共和国本身，就是对整个社会主义阵营也有着重大的意义。这是社会主义社会制度优越于腐朽的帝国主义世界的又一证明。
    你们国家的人民公社也全面地证明了它的生命力和存在权利。我们以极大的兴趣看到了又一生动的证明，这便是北京郊区中德友好人民公社在征服自然灾害，在为争取在秋季获得丰收的斗争中所取得的成就。
    人民公社意味着吃饱饭，为千百万农民创造一种更好的生活。尽管一切诬蔑，这种榜样对于亚洲人民，特别是千百万农民群众来说越来越成为一股吸引力量。
    当然，在解决这种伟大任务时会有局部的和暂时的困难。这一点在中华人民共和国是如此，无可争辩，在德意志民主共和国为实现第五次党代表大会的决议的斗争中也是如此。在我们这里也有这种人，甚至在我们自己的队伍里也有人，认为我们发展的速度太快。中国共产党的八届八中全会给了这些人以正确的答复。中国人民的热情与工作成果，今年年底将要取得的总成就，对于悲观主义者和怀疑派是很好的教训。
    我们两国人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义学说的基础上，以牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的合作紧密地团结一起，沿着社会主义的道路向前迈进，无论是帝国主义的叫嚣，或是任何阴谋与捣乱都不能阻拦我们在东方和西方完成我们的历史任务。
    德中两国人民友好万岁！
    中国劳动人民的领导，经过斗争考验的中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
