Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: A grand rally celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic was held here this afternoon. The rally was jointly organized by The Central Committee of the German Socialist United Party, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

The "Werner Seelenbinder" Hall in Berlin was filled with representatives from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic. People welcomed the party and government delegations from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China, and the delegation representing the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from more than twenty countries, including France, to participate in the celebration. Government delegations from other countries, twenty trade union delegations, diplomatic envoys, and guests from West Germany also attended the celebration.

Party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, Grotewohl, Dieckmann, and others attended the celebration.

The meeting was presided over by Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber. Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a report on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

In his report, Grotewohl extended festive greetings to the working people of the whole country on behalf of President Pieck, the Council of Ministers, the Socialist Unity Party, and the National Council of the National Front. He said that ten years ago, a new page was opened in the national history of Germany, writing "German Democratic Republic - the first worker-peasant state in German history." Today, we are summing up our achievements. We stand on the solid foundation of successfully building socialism and are confidently marching towards the victory of socialism. All conspiracies to undermine the German Democratic Republic have failed and will continue to fail in the future.

Grotewohl then spoke about the great achievements of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. He pointed out that in the past ten years, industrial output has tripled, and the German Democratic Republic has now jumped to fifth place in Europe in terms of industrial output. The per capita mining volume of lignite and the output of synthetic fibers rank first in the world. In agriculture, about 50% of the arable land belongs to the socialist sector. In the next few years, the German Democratic Republic will be self-sufficient in meat, milk, vegetable oil, animal fats, and eggs. Retail sales will increase from 13.8 billion marks in 1949 to 43.6 billion marks this year, and commodity prices have been reduced a total of seventeen times by May of last year. In terms of foreign trade, the German Democratic Republic currently has trade relations with more than 100 countries, and the trade volume has increased by about five and a half times compared to 1949. The welfare facilities for the working people have also been greatly increased. On a per capita basis, no capitalist country has as many factory kindergartens, nurseries, sanatoriums, and factory clinics as the German Democratic Republic. Grotewohl pointed out that the real economic miracle in Germany is not in capitalist West Germany, but was created by the working people of the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl expressed his gratitude for the enormous assistance given by the Soviet Union.

Turning to foreign policy, Grotewohl pointed out that one of the main tasks of the German Democratic Republic in foreign affairs is to maintain peace in Germany and never allow war to break out from German territory. He said that the German Democratic Republic is closely linked with the countries of the socialist family on the basis of the principle of proletarian internationalism and the commonality of interests and goals; it supports the anti-imperialist struggle of nationalist countries and helps them consolidate national independence and sovereignty; and it pursues the principle of peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries and develops multifaceted economic and cultural relations.

Grotewohl continued, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis are the fundamental issues of the policy of the German Democratic Republic. Strengthening the German Democratic Republic means strengthening all forces conducive to German reunification. Grotewohl condemned the West German Bonn government's policy of war preparations and its rejection of all proposals for understanding from the German Democratic Republic. He said that we will never allow the German Democratic Republic to be forcibly incorporated into West Germany at any time, and the reunification of Germany can only be achieved by eliminating militarism and transforming the whole of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country. Grotewohl supported the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. He said that at present, the most important contribution that the two Germanys can make to maintaining peace in Europe and the world is to respond to this historic call for peace from the Soviet Union.

The last part of Grotewohl's report was about the future development of the German Democratic Republic. He said that the development of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is of outstanding significance. It is a militant Marxist-Leninist party, a unified, strong, and experienced leading core, leading the German Democratic Republic towards socialism. He said that the Seven-Year Plan is a great program for the victory of socialism, which will link the German Democratic Republic more closely with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He called on everyone to tap all potentials and complete the Seven-Year Plan. He said, let the words "Socialism will win" guide us forward to the second decade.

Grotewohl's report was constantly met with warm applause from the audience.

Subsequently, the head of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kozlov, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

Kozlov said that the founding of the German Democratic Republic is one of the greatest international events since World War II and the most remarkable event in German history. He said that the results of the path that the German Democratic Republic has traveled in the past ten years are enormous. The fruits of socialism have firmly penetrated the lives of the working people in the cities and countryside of the German Democratic Republic.

Kozlov pointed out that the ruling circles in West Germany are afraid that the German Democratic Republic and its internal and external policies will become a huge attraction to all Germans. He emphasized that the working people of the German Democratic Republic are not afraid of the threats habitually used by West German militarists. He said that the people of the German Democratic Republic have loyal and reliable friends from the Baltic coast to the Pacific Ocean.

Kozlov spoke about the great achievements made by the countries of the socialist camp. He said: The era in which we now live is an era in which the dawn of communism has already risen on the earth, illuminating the path to a bright communist tomorrow for all peoples.

Kozlov emphasized that the Soviet government believes that the speedy resolution of the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany is of great significance. He said that no matter how complicated this issue is, it must be resolved if we want to truly achieve lasting peace in Europe. The realistic solution proposed by life itself is to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys that have existed for ten years.

Kozlov also pointed out that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated in the past and now that the West Berlin issue should be resolved quickly in accordance with the interests of easing tensions in Germany and Europe and defending lasting peace. He emphasized the great significance of the fact that the heads of the Soviet government and the US President agreed that the issue of comprehensive disarmament is the most important issue in the world today, and they expressed that the two countries will spare no effort to strive for a constructive solution to this issue.

Finally, Kozlov read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPSU Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government to the party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic, Pieck, Ulbricht, and Grotewohl.

The head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, Member of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council, Nie Rongzhen, spoke at the meeting.

Nie Rongzhen also read out the congratulatory telegram from our party and state leaders to the party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic.

The speeches of Kozlov and Nie Rongzhen were warmly welcomed.

Subsequently, attendees welcomed the congratulatory messages delivered by the head of the Polish Party and Government Delegation, Cyrankiewicz, the head of the Czechoslovak Party and Government Delegation, Ďuranský, the head of the French Communist Party Delegation, Thorez, and the head of the Iraqi government delegation, Brigadier General Ali Galib Aziz. Next, Mitzheim, a representative of Christians in the German Democratic Republic, and West German guest Westerfalle also spoke at the meeting.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht, delivered a concluding speech thanking the foreign guests for their congratulations. He said that these congratulations will inspire the people of the German Democratic Republic to complete the great tasks of the Seven-Year Plan.

Ulbricht then pointed out that the decisive factor in the achievements made by the German Democratic Republic is the realization of the unity of the working class and all peace-loving people, and this unity is also a guarantee for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Ulbricht emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to establish rational relations with all capitalist countries. He said that today, the governments of those countries that are still unwilling to see the German Democratic Republic will change their attitude in less than ten years, and the time when the two Germanys negotiate with each other will inevitably come. He reiterated that the German Democratic Republic is willing to negotiate with the West German government.

Ulbricht welcomed the people of West Germany to visit the German Democratic Republic. He called on all forces willing to understand each other to cooperate, and the first common task is to end the Bonn atomic war policy.

Finally, a cultural program was performed at the celebration. (Attached picture)

    柏林集会庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十周年
    格罗提渥作建国十周年报告　中苏等国代表致词热烈祝贺
    新华社柏林6日电　今天下午这里隆重举行了德意志民主共和国成立十周年庆祝大会。大会是由德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会联合举行的。
    柏林“魏纳·西兰宾德”大厅坐满了德意志民主共和国各界的代表。人们欢迎苏联、中国等兄弟国家党政代表团和法国等二十多个国家兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团参加庆祝大会。参加庆祝大会的还有其他一些国家的政府代表团和二十个工会代表团，以及各国外交使节和西德的来宾。
    德意志民主共和国党和国家的领导人乌布利希、格罗提渥、狄克曼等出席了庆祝大会。
    大会由人民议院主席团主席狄克曼主持。格罗提渥总理在会上作了关于德意志民主共和国成立十周年的报告。
    格罗提渥在报告中代表皮克总统、部长会议、统一社会党、全国阵线全国委员会向全国劳动人民祝贺节日。他说，十年前，在德国的民族历史上揭开了写着“德意志民主共和国——德国历史上的第一个工农国家”的新的一页。今天，我们正在总结我们的成就。我们站在顺利地建设社会主义的稳固基础上，而且正在满怀信心地向着社会主义的胜利迈进。所有一切破坏德意志民主共和国的阴谋都归于失败了，而且在今后也将同样地归于失败。
    格罗提渥接着谈到了德意志民主共和国国民经济的伟大成就。他指出，十年中，工业产值增长为三倍，现在德意志民主共和国在工业品产量方面已跃居欧洲第五位；按人口平均计算的褐煤开采量和合成纤维产量占世界首位。在农业方面，已有约50％的耕地属于社会主义部分。今后几年内，德意志民主共和国的肉类、奶类、食油、动物油脂和蛋类等都将自给自足。商品零售额将从1949年的一百三十八亿马克增加到今年的四百三十六亿马克，而商品的价格到去年5月为止，总共已减价十七次。在对外贸易方面，目前德意志民主共和国同一百多个国家有着贸易关系，贸易额增加为1949年的五倍半左右。对劳动人民福利设施也大大增加，按人口平均计算，没有一个资本主义国家有德意志民主共和国那样多的工厂幼儿园、托儿所、休养所、工厂门诊所。格罗提渥指出，德国的真正经济奇迹不在资本主义的西德，而是德意志民主共和国劳动人民创造的。
    格罗提渥表示感谢苏联所给予的巨大援助。
    在谈到外交政策时，格罗提渥指出，德意志民主共和国在外交方面的主要任务之一是维护德国和平，决不允许从德国领土上爆发战争。他说，德意志民主共和国在无产阶级国际主义原则上，在利益和目标共同一致的基础上，和社会主义大家庭各国家紧密地联系在一起；支持民族主义国家的反帝斗争，帮助它们巩固民族独立和主权；对资本主义国家奉行和平共处原则，发展多方面的经济和文化关系。
    格罗提渥接着说，争取缔结对德和约和在和平民主基础上重新统一德国，是德意志民主共和国政策的根本问题。加强德意志民主共和国意味着加强一切有助于德国重新统一的力量。格罗提渥谴责西德波恩政府的备战政策和拒绝德意志民主共和国的一切谅解的建议，他说，我们任何时候也不会允许以武力把德意志民主共和国并入西德，德国重新统一只能是肃清军国主义、变全德国为一个和平和民主的国家。格罗提渥支持苏联的全面和彻底裁军的建议，他说，目前，两个德国对维护欧洲和世界和平最重要的贡献就是响应苏联这一历史性的和平呼吁。
    格罗提渥报告的最后一部分是关于德意志民主共和国今后的发展。他说，德国统一社会党的发展具有杰出的意义。它是一个马克思列宁主义的战斗的党，是统一的、坚强的、有经验的领导核心，它领导德意志民主共和国向社会主义前进。他说，七年计划是社会主义胜利的伟大纲领，它把德意志民主共和国和苏联及其他社会主义国家更加紧密地联系起来。他号召挖掘一切潜力，完成七年计划。他说，让“社会主义必胜”的字句引导我们向第二个十年前进。
    格罗提渥的报告不断获得全场的热烈掌声。
    随后，苏联党政代表团团长、苏共中央主席团委员、部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫在会上致祝词。
    科兹洛夫说，德意志民主共和国的成立是第二次世界大战以后最大的国际事件之一，是德国历史上最卓越的事件。他说，德意志民主共和国十年来所走过的道路的结果是巨大的。社会主义的果实已经牢固地深入到德意志民主共和国城乡劳动人民的生活中了。
    科兹洛夫指出，西德统治集团害怕德意志民主共和国和它所执行的内外政策变成对全体德国人的巨大吸引力。他强调指出，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民不害怕西德军国主义者所惯用的威胁。他说，德意志民主共和国人民有着从波罗的海海岸到太平洋的忠实而可靠的朋友。
    科兹洛夫谈到了社会主义阵营各国所取得的伟大成就。他说：我们现在所生活的时代是共产主义的曙光已经在地球上升起的时代，它给各国人民照亮了通向光明的共产主义明天的道路。
    科兹洛夫强调指出，苏联政府认为，尽速解决对德媾和的问题具有重大意义。他说，这个问题无论怎样复杂，都必须加以解决，如果我们想真正取得欧洲的持久和平的话。生活本身所提出的现实的解决办法是，同已经存在了十年的两个德国缔结和约。
    科兹洛夫还指出，苏联过去和现在都一贯主张西柏林问题应当按照缓和德国和欧洲紧张局势和保卫持久和平的利益来迅速加以解决。他强调指出了下面这一事实的重大意义：苏联政府首脑和美国总统一致认为，全面裁军问题是目前世界上最重要的问题，他们表示两国将不遗余力地争取建设性地解决这个问题。
    科兹洛夫最后宣读了苏共中央、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联政府给德意志民主共和国党和国家领导人皮克、乌布利希和格罗提渥的贺电。
    中国党政代表团团长、中共中央委员、国务院副总理聂荣臻在会上讲了话。
    聂荣臻还宣读了我国党和国家领导人致德意志民主共和国党和国家领导人的贺电。
    科兹洛夫和聂荣臻的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。
    随后，到会者欢迎波兰党政代表团团长西伦凯维兹、捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团团长杜兰斯基、法国共产党代表团团长多列士、伊拉克政府代表团团长阿里·加利卜·阿齐兹准将所致的贺词。接着，德意志民主共和国基督教徒代表米岑海姆和西德客人威斯特伐伦也在会上讲了话。
    统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希最后致词感谢外国来宾的祝贺。他说，这些祝贺将鼓舞德意志民主共和国人民去完成七年计划的伟大任务。
    乌布利希接着指出，德意志民主共和国现在所取得的成就，决定性的因素是实现了工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人们的统一，这种统一也是以和平方式重新统一德国的保障。
    乌布利希强调指出，德意志民主共和国政府愿同一切资本主义国家建立理智的关系。他说，今天，那些还不愿意看到德意志民主共和国的国家的政府，用不了十年将会改变它们的态度，两个德国相互谈判的时候也必将会到来。他再次表示德意志民主共和国愿意同西德政府进行谈判。
    乌布利希表示欢迎西德人民访问德意志民主共和国。他号召一切愿意谅解的力量进行合作，而第一个共同的任务就是结束波恩原子战争政策。
    庆祝大会最后演出了文艺节目。（附图片）
