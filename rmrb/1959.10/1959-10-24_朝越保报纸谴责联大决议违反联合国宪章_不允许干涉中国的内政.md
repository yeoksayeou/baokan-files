Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today, condemning the United Nations General Assembly for passing a so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue" under the manipulation of the United States.

The commentary pointed out that including the so-called "Tibet issue," which does not in fact exist, on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly already completely violated the fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter regarding non-interference in the internal affairs of a country, and even more, it should not pass any "resolution" in this regard.

The commentary said that fair-minded people around the world, including representatives from many UN member states, believe that passing this shameful resolution is a conspiracy by imperialism to intensify the "Cold War."

The commentary said that, as is well known, the legitimate measures taken by the Chinese government against the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet under the instigation of imperialism are entirely China's internal affairs. It is the warmongers headed by US imperialism who covet Tibet, an inseparable part of China.

The commentary emphasized that all facts prove that the so-called resolution on the "Tibet issue" is merely a despicable act by those who harbor hostility and hatred towards the brilliant achievements of the People's Republic of China in socialist construction, to damage the increasingly enhanced international prestige of the People's China, to oppose the relaxation of international tensions, and to sharpen international relations, using the platform of the United Nations. And this absurd act can only poison the international atmosphere and greatly damage the prestige of the United Nations itself.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today condemning the United States and its followers for forcing the United Nations General Assembly to pass a so-called "resolution on the Tibet issue," and pointed out that this "resolution" is completely illegal.

The commentary said: The so-called "resolution" on the "Tibet issue" is entirely based on a blatant distortion of facts. Tibet has been a sacred and inseparable part of Chinese territory for thousands of years.

The commentary said that the entire conspiracy of US imperialism to create the so-called "Tibet issue" is to oppose the human rights and various freedoms of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, including the Tibetan people. The so-called "resolution" of the United Nations on the "Tibet issue" is merely an ugly drama manufactured by the United States, and it is nothing more than a piece of waste paper that should be thrown into the trash can. This "resolution" further exposes the conspiracy of the United States to still stubbornly pursue the Cold War, engage in provocations and slanders, in order to create international tensions.

The commentary said that the so-called "resolution" on the "Tibet issue" further illustrates that US imperialism is unwilling to abandon its policy of interference and aggression against China and Asian-African countries. The people of Asian and African countries who are fighting against imperialism and striving for and safeguarding freedom and true independence must further heighten their vigilance against the hostile conspiracies of US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 23rd: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published a commentary today saying that discussing the so-called "Tibet issue" and passing a corresponding resolution at the United Nations General Assembly is an intolerable interference in China's internal affairs and a complete violation of the United Nations Charter.

The commentary said that the purpose of the culprits who raised the so-called "Tibet issue" to the United Nations General Assembly is: to attempt to spread distrust and alienate the people of China and other Asian countries, thereby creating favorable conditions for these culprits to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries.

The commentary emphasized that, however, this conspiracy of imperialism did not succeed. Representatives of all major Asian and African countries were not fooled and abstained during the vote.

"Fatherland Front" published a commentary today saying that the result of raising the so-called "Tibet issue" is just like the saying goes: "Went to shear wool, but got hair sheared off instead." The United States has not only failed to strengthen its unwise policy against China, but has instead harmed itself even more.

### 朝越保报纸谴责联大决议违反联合国宪章  不允许干涉中国的内政

    朝越保报纸谴责联大决议违反联合国宪章
    不允许干涉中国的内政
    据新华社平壤23日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，谴责联合国大会在美国操纵下通过所谓关于“西藏问题”的决议。
    评论指出，把事实上并不存在的所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程，就已经完全违背了联合国宪章关于不干涉一国内政的基本原则，更不应该在这方面通过什么“决议”。
    评论说，包括许多联合国成员国代表在内的世界公正人士都认为，通过这项可耻的决议，是帝国主义加紧进行“冷战”的阴谋。
    评论说，如所周知，中国政府对西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义的嗾使下发动的叛乱所采取的正当措施，是完全属于中国的内政，倒是以美帝国主义为首的好战分子垂涎着西藏这块中国不可分割的领土。
    评论强调说，一切事实证明，所谓关于“西藏问题”的决议，只不过是那些对中华人民共和国在社会主义建设中取得的光辉成就怀着敌意和憎恨的人，为了损害人民中国日益提高的国际威信，反对缓和国际紧张局势，使国际关系尖锐化，而利用联合国讲台进行的丑恶的勾当。而这种荒唐无稽的勾当，只能毒化国际气氛，大大损害联合国本身的威信。
    据新华社河内23日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论谴责美国和它的追随者迫使联合国大会通过所谓“关于西藏问题”的“决议”，并且指出这项“决议”是完全非法的。
    评论说：所谓“西藏问题”的“决议”，完全出于明目张胆的对事实的歪曲。西藏千年以来一直是中国领土的神圣的一部分。
    评论说，美帝国主义制造所谓“西藏问题”的全部阴谋，是为了反对包括西藏人民在内的中国各族人民的人权和各种自由权利。联合国关于“西藏问题”的所谓“决议”，只是美国一手制造的丑剧，他不过是应该扔到垃圾箱里的废纸而已。这个“决议”进一步暴露了美国仍然顽固地追随冷战、进行挑衅和诬蔑，以制造国际紧张局势的阴谋。
    评论说，所谓“西藏问题”的“决议”，进一步说明美帝国主义不甘心情愿抛弃它对中国和亚非国家的干涉和侵略的政策。正在进行反对帝国主义、争取和维护自由和真正独立的斗争的亚非各国人民，必须进一步对美帝国主义的敌意阴谋提高警惕。
  据新华社索非亚23日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”今天发表评论说，在联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”和通过相应决议，是对中国内政的不可容忍的干涉，是完全违反联合国宪章的行为。
    评论说，把所谓“西藏问题”提到联合国大会的罪魁们的目的是：企图在中国和其他亚洲各国人民间散布不信任，离间他们，从而造成这些罪魁们干涉亚洲各国内政的有利条件。
    评论强调指出，但是，帝国主义的这一阴谋并未得逞。所有亚洲和非洲的较大的国家的代表并没有上当，表决时都弃了权。
    “祖国阵线报”今天发表评论说，提出所谓“西藏问题”的结果，正像俗话所说的：“去剪羊毛，但却被剪掉了头发”。美国不但没有加强它的反对中国的不明智的政策，反而更加害了自己。
