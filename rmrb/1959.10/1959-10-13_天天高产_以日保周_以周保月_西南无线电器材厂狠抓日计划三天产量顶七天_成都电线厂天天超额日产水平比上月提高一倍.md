　　Daily High Yield, Guaranteeing Weekly Production, Guaranteeing Monthly Production
    Southwest Radio Equipment Factory Firmly Grasps Daily Plans, Three Days' Output Tops Seven Days
    Chengdu Wire Factory Exceeds Daily Production Every Day, Production Level Doubles Compared to Last Month
    (Our Newspaper reports) In the decisive battle for the fourth quarter, the Chengdu Southwest Radio Equipment Factory focused on weekly and daily plans, implementing them at all levels, and tightening its grip at every step. It only took three days to complete 17.9% of the October output value plan and 24.6% of the output plan, achieving daily high yield.
    In order to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, the factory Party committee, based on the provincial Party committee's urgent instructions on the decisive battle for the fourth quarter, convened a staff and worker meeting and a cadres' meeting, arranged the October production tasks, and implemented the plans at all levels. At the same time, it strengthened political and ideological work and inspection and supervision, and adopted various measures to resolutely realize "guaranteeing weekly production with daily production, and guaranteeing monthly production with weekly production." Workers in the first workshop made production preparations before the holiday and stored a batch of semi-finished products. After setting a target of completing the October variety plan eight days ahead of schedule, they arranged the plan by week, focused on the daily plans of work sections, groups, and individuals, and announced the completion of the daily plan at any time, so that everyone was clear about the situation. When focusing on daily plans, the fourth workshop continued to implement the effective "one arrangement, three inspections, two grasps, and two evaluations" experience from September and added a new measure of holding scheduling meetings to understand the completion of the plan by each shift at any time, solve current production problems in a timely manner, and exchange new experiences, achieving tight and accurate grasps. The electric furnace work section of the ninth workshop rectified the labor organization, assigning tasks to each furnace so that operators knew what products to produce each week and day, and how much to produce. Moreover, when the work section could not supply the needs of production, they promptly balanced and adjusted forces to ensure that the furnace did not stop, guaranteeing the smooth completion of the daily plan.
    Doing a good job in organizing production is a powerful guarantee for realizing "daily red." Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production in the work of grasping daily plans, paying attention to discovering and overcoming weak links in production at any time, grasping key production factors, and organizing forces to launch assaults in a timely manner. Leading cadres of the first, fourth, and ninth workshops respectively organized production command posts, responsible for contract work on production lines, guarding key points, and adopting the "three-combination" method to solve major key problems in a timely manner. After the joint efforts of the workers, all workshops have completed their plans day by day in the past three days, under the premise of ensuring product quality and safe production. Among them, the first workshop completed 27% of the monthly plan, the fourth workshop completed 22% of the monthly plan, and the pickling group of the third workshop has completed 62% of the monthly plan, creating a new high-yield record in the great battle of October.
    (Our Newspaper reports) In the great battle of October, the staff and workers of the Chengdu Wire Factory focused on plans, firmly grasped progress, and exceeded the daily plan by about 30% every day in October, with the daily production level doubling compared to September.
    The Party committee of this factory, in the spirit of great effort and tight control, convened a series of mobilization meetings after the holiday, allowing the spirit of the provincial Party committee's urgent instructions to penetrate deeply into the hearts of the people; at the same time, it implemented the October production plan and measures. On this basis, it also organized a factory-wide skills competition. Under the encouragement of the fighting slogans "Strive for every ounce, strive for every second," and "Exceed the quota every day, never owe a debt," all the staff and workers of the factory were full of energy and high morale, and launched various forms of competitions. Workshops and workshops, groups and groups, set off a wave of challenges and acceptance, and the workers' guarantee letters, resolutions, and production good news flew to the Party committee like snowflakes. The workers of the smelting workshop worked harder and more skillfully, conscientiously implementing the advanced experience of rapid copper smelting, and summed up the experience of increasing furnace temperature, shortening the smelting time, and expanding the capacity of the furnace. The daily output of anode copper increased from an average of ten tons in September to more than twenty tons. In the competition, the three shifts of the yarn-covered wire work section of the electromagnetic wire workshop chased each other and refused to give in. The output of yarn-covered wire increased day by day, from 376 kilograms on the first day after the holiday to 602 kilograms on the third day; the enameled wire work section adopted the "three-combination" method to rush to install enameled wire machines and quickly put them into production, and the daily output of enameled wire increased by two times compared to September.
    In order to ensure sustained high yield and continuous leaps forward, the factory leaders strengthened the supervision and inspection of production to ensure daily overproduction. Each workshop and production team conscientiously checked the completion of the shift plan and the daily plan. Factory-level leaders also went to the front line of production to direct the battle. At the same time, one-third of the department cadres were drawn to work in the workshops with relatively weak forces, working with the workshop workers to solve key problems in production.
    In production, the masses were vigorously mobilized to besiege the material barrier. On the one hand, special personnel were sent to speed up the mining and transportation of raw materials; on the other hand, the workers of the smelting workshop were mobilized to open two more furnaces to process accumulated enamel slag, refine refined copper and crude copper, and vigorously improve current efficiency and increase self-produced electrolytic copper. After taking these three measures, the problem of raw material supply has been basically solved, creating conditions for guaranteeing daily red, daily rise, and increasing steadily.

　　天天高产  以日保周  以周保月
    西南无线电器材厂狠抓日计划三天产量顶七天
    成都电线厂天天超额日产水平比上月提高一倍
    本报讯　成都西南无线电器材厂在决战四季度中，大抓周计划、日计划，层层落实，步步抓紧，只用了三天的时间，就完成了10月份产值计划的17.9％和产量计划的24.6％，夺得了日日高产。
    为了提前和超额完成全年计划，工厂党委根据省委关于决战四季度的紧急指示，召开了职工大会和干部会，安排了10月份的生产任务，把计划层层落实，同时加强政治思想工作和检查督促，采取各种措施，坚决实现“以日保周，以周保月”。一车间职工在节日前作好了生产准备并储备了一批半成品，订出提前八天完成10月份品种计划以后，把计划按周作了安排，狠抓工段、小组、个人的日计划，随时公布完成日计划情况，使人人心中有数。四车间在大抓日计划时，继续推行9月份行之有效的“一安排、三检查、两抓、两评比”的经验，并增添了召开调度会的新措施，随时了解各班完成计划情况，及时解决当前生产问题，交流新的经验，作到了抓紧、抓准。九车间电炉工段整顿了劳动组织，把任务分配到每个炉子，使操作工人知道一周一日要生产些什么产品，生产多少，而且当上工段供应不上生产需要时，就及时平衡调整力量，确保炉子不停，保证了日计划的顺利完成。
    作好组织生产工作，是实现“日日红”的有力保证，各级领导干部在大抓日计划的工作中，深入生产第一线，随时注意发现和克服生产中的薄弱环节，猛抓生产关键，及时组织力量展开突击。一、四、九等车间的领导干部分别组织了生产指挥部，分生产专线负责包干，分口把守，并采取“三结合”的方法及时解决重大关键问题。经过职工们的协力奋战，三天来，各车间都在保证产品质量和安全生产的前提下，逐日完成了计划。其中，一车间完成月计划的27％，四车间完成月计划的22％，三车间酸洗组已经完成月计划的62％，创大战10月高产纪录。
    本报讯　成都电线厂职工在大战10月中，紧抓计划，狠抓进度，进入10月每天都超额30％左右完成日计划，日生产水平比9月份提高一倍。
    这个厂的党委本着大干特干，抓紧抓狠的精神，在节后召开了一系列的动员会议，使省委的紧急指示的精神深入人心；同时将10月份生产计划和措施落实。在此基础上，又组织了全厂性的比武大会。全厂职工在“斤两必争，分秒必争”，“天天超额，绝不欠账”的战斗口号鼓舞下，干劲十足，斗志旺盛，开展了各种形式的竞赛，车间与车间、小组与小组掀起了挑应战热潮，职工们的保证书、决心书以及生产捷报像雪片似地飞向党委。冶炼车间职工劲上加劲，巧上加巧，认真贯彻快速炼铜的先进经验，并总结了提高炉温的经验，缩短了冶炼时间，扩大了炉子的容量，日产阳极铜由9月份平均十吨提高到二十吨以上。电磁线车间纱包线工段三个班在竞赛中，你追我赶互不相让，纱包线的产量日日上升，由节后第一天的三百七十六公斤，第三天跃到六百零二公斤；漆包线工段采取“三结合”的方法，突击安装漆包机，迅速投入生产，漆包线的日产量比9月份提高了两倍。
    为了保证持续高产，连续跃进，工厂领导上加强对生产的督促检查，保证日日超产。各车间和各个生产班组，认真检查班计划和日计划的完成情况。厂一级领导干部也分头到生产前线指挥战斗。同时抽出三分之一的科室干部，到力量比较薄弱的车间跟班劳动，同车间职工一起解决生产中的关键问题。
    在生产中大力发动群众围攻材料关，一方面派出专人加紧采运原材料，一方面动员冶炼车间职工增开两个炉处理堆积的釉渣，提炼精铜和粗铜，并大力提高电流效率，增加自产电解铜。采取这三方面的措施后，原材料供应问题已经基本上得到解决，为保证日日红，日日升，节节高创造了条件。
