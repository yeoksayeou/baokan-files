Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th - This year, the production of raw materials for the national ferrous metallurgical industry has already achieved great success. According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, in the first nine months of this year, national iron ore production has completed 92.2% of the annual state plan, and the absolute output has increased more than two times compared to the same period last year; among them, the ore produced by local small and medium-sized mines has increased seven times compared to the same period last year, and has already completed the annual plan ahead of schedule and in excess. Manganese ore, magnesite, and refractory clay have also increased by more than one to two times compared to the same period last year. The quality of various ores has also generally improved, with the average grade of iron ore increasing by 1% to 3% compared to the planned target. At the same time, the main economic indicators of ore production, such as mining intensity, drilling machine and electric shovel efficiency, have all significantly improved compared to the same period last year.

In the last few months of this year, the national ferrous metallurgical mine workers will also provide sufficient ore raw materials for the national steel production. To this end, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national ferrous metallurgical mine conference at the Pangjiabao Iron Mine in Xuanhua, Hebei Province.

The meeting pointed out that the great leap forward in national mine production in the first nine months of this year was due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's mass line work method, strengthening enterprise management through large-scale mass movements, in-depth development of socialist labor competitions, tapping potential, and establishing and improving various rules and regulations to promote production development. Especially in the development and construction of mines, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" and "simultaneous development of large, medium, and small," the number of iron ore mines in the country has increased fifteen times in less than a year, manganese mines have increased five times, and clay mines have increased six times. The existing small and medium-sized iron ore mines have already undertaken about half of the national iron ore production task. The meeting pointed out that under the inspiration of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the current national steel production level is soaring, and the demand for iron ore is constantly increasing. According to preliminary calculations, in the last few months of this year, in addition to completing the original ore production plan, it is also necessary to increase the production of high-quality ore by 20%. This requires all mining enterprises not only to supply sufficient ore raw materials on time, with guaranteed quality, and in the right varieties, but also to ensure that each smelting enterprise has reserves and turnover. At the same time, it is also necessary to do a corresponding mining preparation work for a greater leap forward in ore production next year. Therefore, the current mine production policy is: to deeply develop the increased production and economy movement centered on increasing mining intensity and accelerating stripping (tunneling), focusing on improving the four major indicators of mineral processing, and aiming at high yield, high quality, and low cost, and strive for a comprehensive harvest in mining, mining preparation, and mineral processing.

While clarifying the basic tasks of current mine production, the meeting also exchanged more than 30 major advanced experiences such as improving mining intensity and strengthening quality management, introducing methods and providing measures for further increasing the production of high-quality ore.

The meeting requested that in the production in the next few months, in addition to grasping ideology, adhering to putting politics in command, further opposing rightism, boosting morale, deeply mobilizing the masses, and extensively carrying out various forms of socialist labor competitions, all units must also firmly grasp the ten major measures of mine production such as geological surveying, mining preparation, mining intensity, quality management, lean ore washing, fine ore sintering, transportation loading and unloading, maintenance and repair, safe production, and cost accounting, to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the increased production and economy tasks in the last few months of this year.

　　群众运动风起云涌  劳动竞赛热气腾腾
    铁矿石比去年同期增两倍
    冶金部召开矿山会议交流经验促进增产再增产
    新华社天津11日电　今年全国黑色冶金工业原料生产已经取得巨大成就。据冶金工业部的统计，在今年的头九个月里，全国铁矿石产量已经完成全年国家计划的92.2％，绝对产量比去年同期增长了两倍以上；其中地方中小型矿山所产的矿石比去年同期增长了七倍，已经提前超额完成了全年的计划。锰矿石、菱镁矿石和耐火粘土等，也比去年同期增长了一倍到两倍以上。各种矿石质量也普遍上升，其中铁矿石的平均品位比计划指标提高1％到3％。同时，矿石生产的主要经济指标，如采矿强度、穿孔机和电铲的效率等，都比去年同期有显著提高。
    在今年的最后几个月里，全国黑色冶金矿山职工还将为全国钢铁生产提供足够的矿石原料。为此，冶金工业部最近在河北省宣化庞家堡铁矿召开了全国黑色冶金矿山会议。
    会议指出，今年头九个月全国矿山生产的大跃进，是由于认真贯彻了党的群众路线的工作方法，通过大搞群众运动，加强了企业管理，深入地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，挖掘了潜力，建立与健全了促进生产发展的各项规章制度。特别在矿山的发展建设中，由于贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”和“大中小并举”的方针，使全国铁矿矿山的数量在不到一年的时间内增加了十五倍，锰矿增加了五倍，粘土矿增加了六倍。现有的中小型铁矿已经担负全国一半左右的铁矿石产量任务。会议指出，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，目前全国钢铁生产水平扶摇直上，对于铁矿石的需要量不断加多。据初步计算，在今年的最后几个月内除了完成原订矿石生产计划以外，还须增产20％的优质矿石。这就要求各个矿山企业，不仅要按时、按质、按品种供应充足的矿石原料，而且要保证各个冶炼企业有储备、有周转。同时，还要为明年矿石生产的更大跃进做好相应的采矿准备工作。因此，当前矿山生产的方针是：深入地开展以提高采矿强度、加速剥离（掘进）为中心，以提高选矿四大指标为重点，以高产、优质、低成本为目的的增产节约运动，力争采矿、采矿准备、选矿全面丰收。
    会议在明确当前矿山生产的基本任务的同时，还交流了提高采矿强度、加强质量管理等三十多项重大的先进经验，为进一步增产优质矿石介绍了方法，提供了措施。
    会议要求各单位在今后几个月的生产中，除了大抓思想、坚持政治挂帅，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，深入发动群众，广泛开展各种形式的社会主义劳动竞赛以外，还必须狠抓地质测量，采矿准备，采矿强度，质量管理，贫矿洗选，粉矿烧结，运输装卸，维护检修，安全生产，成本核算等矿山生产十大措施，以保证完成和超额完成今年最后几个月的增产节约任务。
