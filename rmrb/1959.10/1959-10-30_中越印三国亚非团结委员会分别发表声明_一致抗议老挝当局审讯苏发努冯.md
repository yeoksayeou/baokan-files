Xinhua News Agency, October 29th. The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today issued a statement on stopping the U.S.-Sananikone clique's illegal trial of Lao patriotic leaders. The statement said: "The Lao Sananikone government, at the instigation of the United States, disregarding the protests and condemnations of the Lao people and world public opinion, has decided to begin an illegal trial of Prince Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front on November 2nd. This is a frenzied persecution of Lao patriotic and democratic forces and a further serious act of undermining the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. It is clear that this is a new conspiracy by the United States and the Sananikone government to prolong and expand the Lao civil war, regardless of the firm opposition of the Lao people.

"The rapid deterioration of the Lao situation is entirely created by U.S. imperialism, with the aim of intensifying tensions in Asia, undermining peace in Laos and Indochina, and pursuing its policies of aggression and war. This once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Lao people, the Afro-Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world.

"Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, together with the Lao people, have waged unremitting struggles against imperialism, for the independence, democracy, and freedom of Laos, and for the maintenance of peace in Laos and Indochina. The United States and the Lao reactionaries are attempting to persecute them under the fabricated charge of 'conspiracy to commit treason', which cannot but arouse the anger and opposition of the Chinese people.

"The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee strongly protests the persecution of Prince Souphanouvong and other patriotic figures, demands that the Lao authorities immediately stop their illegal trial, and restore their freedom. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Lao people for peace, independence, and democracy. The Lao issue should be resolved reasonably on the basis of and within the framework of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. We are deeply convinced that the will and united strength of the Lao people to safeguard peace, independence, and democracy cannot be suppressed by any reactionary force. Their just cause, with the support of the Afro-Asian and world people, will surely achieve final victory. And the despicable conspiracy of the U.S.-Sananikone clique will once again suffer a shameful defeat."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 29th. According to local newspapers today, the Vietnam Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement on October 28th, protesting the Phoui Sananikone government's preparation to illegally try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The statement said that the Phoui Sananikone government, a lackey of U.S. imperialism, imprisoning and preparing to "try" Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front is an act that violates the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. This illegal action is also a conspiracy to destroy the possibility of a peaceful solution to the Lao issue and a provocation against the Afro-Asian and world people.

The statement said that as a party to the 1954 Geneva Accords, the Vietnamese people are keenly concerned about the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and keenly concerned about the peaceful and friendly relations between the Vietnamese and Lao people. The Vietnamese people demand respect for the Geneva Accords on Laos, demand the cancellation of the decision to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, restore their freedom, and guarantee the lives of these outstanding fighters of the Afro-Asian national independence movement; demand an end to the civil war in Laos and an end to U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos.

The statement also expressed warm support for the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's recent appeal to the Afro-Asian and world people to support the Lao people's just struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 29th. Anup Singh, Secretary-General of the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, issued a statement to the press here today, protesting the Kingdom of Laos government's preparation to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The statement said, "We believe that this pre-planned step will aggravate the already existing acute state and make the political situation even more tense."

The statement said, "Considering these circumstances, we call on the Lao government to abandon the planned trial, release these leaders, and help restore the original state of Laos. This step will greatly help improve the atmosphere and make it possible to resolve the problem according to the Geneva Agreements."

    中越印三国亚非团结委员会分别发表声明
    一致抗议老挝当局审讯苏发努冯
    新华社29日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表关于制止美国—萨纳尼空集团非法审讯老挝爱国领袖的声明。声明说：“老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国的唆使下，不顾老挝人民和世界舆论的抗议和谴责，决定于11月2日开始对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他七位领导人进行非法审讯。这是对老挝爱国民主力量的疯狂迫害，是进一步严重地破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。很显然，这是美国和萨纳尼空政府不顾老挝人民的坚决反对，企图延长和扩大老挝内战的一个新阴谋。
    “老挝局势的迅速恶化是美帝国主义一手造成的，其目的是在亚洲加紧制造紧张局势，破坏老挝和印度支那和平和推行其侵略和战争政策。这又再一次地证明美帝国主义是老挝人民、亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的人民最凶恶的敌人。
    “苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人同老挝人民一道，为反对帝国主义，争取老挝的独立、民主和自由，为维护老挝和印度支那的和平进行了不懈的斗争。美国和老挝反动派竟妄图在‘阴谋叛国’的莫须有的罪名下对他们横加迫害，这不能不引起中国人民的愤怒和反对。
    “中国亚非团结委员会强烈抗议对苏发努冯亲王等爱国人士的迫害，要求老挝当局立即停止对他们的非法审讯，并且恢复他们的自由。中国人民坚决支持老挝人民争取和平、独立、民主的正义斗争。老挝问题应当在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上和范围内求得合理解决。我们深信，老挝人民维护和平、独立、民主的意志和团结的力量是任何反动势力都镇压不了的。他们的正义事业，在亚非和全世界人民的声援下定将取得最后胜利。而美国—萨纳尼空集团的卑鄙阴谋必将再一次遭到可耻的失败。”
    新华社河内29日电　据此间报纸今天报道，越南亚非人民团结委员会10月28日发表声明，抗议培·萨纳尼空政府准备非法审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人。
    声明说，美帝国主义的走狗培·萨纳尼空政府监禁并准备“审判”苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人是违反日内瓦协议和万象协议的行动。这个非法行动也是破坏和平解决老挝问题的可能性的阴谋，是对亚非和世界人民的挑衅。
    声明说，作为签订1954年日内瓦协议的一方，越南人民热切关心越南民主共和国的安全和印度支那以及东南亚地区的和平，热切关心越老两国人民的和平友好关系，越南人民要求尊重关于老挝的日内瓦协议，要求取消审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的决定，恢复他们的自由，保障这些亚非民族独立运动的出色战士的生命；要求停止老挝的内战以及美帝国主义停止对老挝的干涉。
    声明还表示热烈支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近向亚非和世界人民发出的支持老挝人民正义斗争的呼吁。
    新华社新德里29日电　印度亚非团结委员会秘书长阿努普·辛格今天在这里向报界发表声明，抗议老挝王国政府准备审讯苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领袖。
    声明说，“我们认为，这个预定的步骤将使已经存在的尖锐状态加剧并使政治局势更加紧张。”
    声明说，“考虑到这些情况，我们呼吁老挝政府放弃计划中的审讯，释放这些领袖，帮助恢复老挝的原状。这种步骤将大大有助于改善气氛，而使根据日内瓦协议来解决问题成为可能。”
