Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 9th October: Good news continues to come from the Polish industrial production front, with major industrial sectors exceeding their third-quarter production plans.

    The heavy industry sector exceeded its third-quarter plan by 3.8%.

    The coal mining industry produced 160,000 tons more coal than planned in the third quarter. The country as a whole has over-fulfilled its coal mining target by 1.62 million tons in the first three quarters of this year.

    The shipbuilding industry experienced a historically significant period in the third quarter: at the end of September, the Gdańsk, Szczecin, Paris Commune, and Northern shipyards each launched a large ocean-going vessel, with a total tonnage of 23,000 tons. This brings the total number of ships produced by the Polish shipbuilding industry to 426, totaling one million tons, in the eleven years since its establishment. To this end, shipbuilding workers across the country held grand celebrations and made ambitious pledges to build another one million tons of ships in the next four years.

    The metallurgical industry also achieved brilliant results in the third quarter. In September alone, metallurgical workers overproduced 10,000 tons of steel, 6,000 tons of steel products, and 23,000 tons of pig iron.

    Other industrial sectors such as cement, textiles, and petroleum also exceeded their planned targets.
