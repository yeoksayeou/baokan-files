Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 30th: More than 800 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a rally at the Moranbong Theater tonight to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Tonight, the Moranbong Theater was brightly lit, and portraits of Premier Kim Il Sung and Chairman Mao Zedong and the national flags of Korea and China were hung high on the rostrum. At 7:30, Korean Workers' Party and government leaders Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hui, Park Kum-chul, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Lim Hae, and others, as well as Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and the head of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation Wei Chuantong, ascended the rostrum amidst warm applause.

Korean First Deputy Premier Kim Il made a report at the meeting.

Kim Il said that in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have achieved decisive victories on all fronts of socialist construction, including the economy, politics, and ideology. The Chinese people, according to the general line and correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party, launched a great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958, and have continued to make new leaps forward since this year. Kim Il said that the past decade of the People's Republic of China has been a decade of great leap forward. The historic changes that have taken place in China in the past ten years demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang then spoke at the meeting.
