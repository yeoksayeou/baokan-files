Aspire to Great Things
Yang Ling

　　志 (zhì), means the goal of striving. To do anything well, one must have a goal. To do great things, one must aspire to greatness. If you want high yields, you must first have high aspirations. To climb to the highest peak of science, you must first have the greatest determination. For lofty goals, even if "one cannot reach it for the time being," one should still "yearn for it." "Yearning for it," and then forging ahead, unafraid of dangers and obstacles, climbing up, one can always get closer and closer, and the temporary "cannot reach" will be transformed into "can reach." If even the "yearning" heart is absent, "cannot" will forever be a "cannot."
　　Some people confuse aspiring to great things with "bragging," which is a huge misunderstanding. Great aspirations are based on a solid foundation according to objective and subjective conditions, and they are to be achieved through concrete and powerful actions. "Bragging" does not rely on effort, but on "air"; it does not require action, but only a mouth; it is not based on seeking truth from facts, but on pandering to the public. The two are so different, so why are they confused by some people? This is because they have similarities in appearance. The similarity lies only in: both declare that they will do things that predecessors have never done and that they themselves have not yet done. This is a phenomenon, not the essence. Phenomena and essence are related, but also different. Only through phenomena can we see the essence; however, only through individual, isolated, and one-sided phenomena can we often fail to see the essence. To distinguish between aspiring to great things and "bragging" in essence is actually not difficult. The most important point is to connect words with actions to see. As long as a more comprehensive analysis of the conditions is made before setting the goal, and after setting the goal, one goes forward with full vigor, then one can only say that one has aspired to greatness; even if one has made an effort and has not reached the intended goal, no one can say that this is "bragging." People in real life are not fairy-tale gods, how can they predict things that have not yet come with perfect accuracy! As long as it is greatly improved compared to the original level, it is something to be happy and celebrated. It cannot be regarded as "bullshit" burst, nor can it be considered a "failure." Moreover, if one effort is not enough, one can make a second, third, or even more efforts! Of course, if one only talks and does not act, then whether it is "making wild promises" or just bragging about a "wellhead," it must be regarded as "bragging," a "sham."
　　Is it too late to aspire to greatness when one is old? Of course, it is better to aspire as early as possible. Having great aspirations from the beginning provides more opportunities to lay a broader and more solid foundation, which may allow for the construction of taller buildings on this foundation. However, if one has not aspired to greatness since childhood, it is not too late to aspire in middle age. Didn't Su Laoquan (Su Xun) begin to study diligently in middle age? He finally achieved considerable accomplishments in literature. It is still worthwhile to aspire to greatness in old age. Didn't an old woman in her fifties also join a literacy class last year and get rid of illiteracy? It is also the same with growing crops. It is best to aspire to a bumper harvest for the next year in early winter, or at least before sowing. In the middle of crop growth, one can still aspire to strive for high yields. Even in the later stage of crop growth, it is by no means that there is nothing to aspire to. Until threshing and warehousing, as long as you put in one more effort, you can get one more point of effect.
　　Aspirations must be constantly established and continuously improved. After the initial aspiration is achieved through hard work, an even higher aspiration must be established, and one must never be "complacent." Once the aspiration is "full," once one is "complacent," once one relaxes, it is bad; not only will one not be able to continue to move forward, but one will also fall. Climbing towards the peak, how dangerous it is if one's hand slips and one's legs soften! If production increased last year, a higher production increase target must be proposed this year; if summer production has increased, a higher production increase target must be proposed for autumn. If the land is well cultivated, it must also be well planted; if it is well planted, it must also be well managed; if it is well managed, it must also be well harvested; if it is well harvested, it must also be well sold, well delivered, well sent, well distributed, well stored, and well used. Learning is also the same. First, one must set an overall goal of climbing the peak of science; during the learning process, one must also set specific goals for continuous improvement in stages. Not only should one set the next goal immediately when one goal is achieved, but one should also propose a higher goal for struggle early before one goal is achieved. This will be more proactive, which may make current actions more energetic and adapt to the trend of transitioning to a higher stage. "Great perseverance comes from great purpose." "Great purpose" is also a great aspiration, which has two aspects of significance: One, it is for the collective, for the whole people, for the distant future, for socialism and communism; and not for individuals, for a few people, for the inch of land in front of you, for personal desires. Second, strive for high speed, strive for high targets, strive for "all-round red," and strive for the biggest and best results. Both aspects are indispensable, and the former plays a decisive role. If it is only out of personal selfishness, then even if the ambition is "big," it is extremely small. For such a purpose, there cannot be much enthusiasm; even if it occasionally appears to have great enthusiasm, it cannot be sustained. Why do some people always waver in the tide of the Great Leap Forward? Why do some people who were once on the crest of the wave suddenly get submerged in the water? Why is some people's "blowing power" very strong but their enthusiasm is very small? There may be many reasons; however, the most important reason is to find it here.
　　Base individualists, opportunists who sneak into the revolutionary ranks, will waver even if they eat a little less pork for a while, and transform themselves to reveal their true colors. Heroic working people with lofty aspirations will not waver in the face of any difficulties. Heroic people who are determined to change the face of "poverty and blankness" are firm in their belief that "man will conquer nature" even in the face of floods and vast expanses of water, and in the face of scorching sun and hundred-day droughts. Lishui County, Jiangsu Province, has suffered from drought for more than 130 days this year; however, the people's communes in this county still have lofty aspirations to turn the disaster year into a bumper year, and strive to increase the total grain output by another 15% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The people in the hilly and mountainous areas of Jiangsu Province who have suffered severely from drought are all responding to the call of the people of Lianshui to aspire to greatness: No disaster in the face of disaster, and overproduction on top of overproduction! What a spirit!
　　As long as the purpose is truly great (selfless, fearless), and one goes ahead with full vigor, one will always achieve it, and can achieve it at a relatively fast speed. The 200,000 builders of the Miyun Reservoir have aspired to greatness, and the vast project that originally required six or seven years to complete has been completed by 70% in one year, and has begun to block the surging flood of the Chaobai River, which often harms during the rainy season. The 14,000 builders of the Great Hall of the People have aspired to greatness, and in ten months, they have erected a solemn and magnificent building in front of Tiananmen Square that is larger than the entire effective building area of the Forbidden City in Beijing. For the great motherland, for the great collective, for the great purpose, people have used great strength and wisdom to overcome great hardships and difficulties. Revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit are united here. This is the real "implementation"; to "implement," one must "implement" in this way. "The lower the target, the better" is discouraging, not implementing. Without great aspirations, without heroic actions under the guidance and encouragement of great aspirations, one can only "fall short," and cannot implement. — Those without aspirations, everything is empty; those with aspirations, things will eventually be accomplished.

　　立大志
　　杨岭
    志，就是奋斗目标。要做好任何一件事情，都不能没有志。要做大事情，就要立大志。要想产量高，先要志向高。要攀登科学的最高峰，先要有最大的决心。对于崇高的目标，暂时“虽不能至”，也应该“心向往之”。“心向往之”，而后勇往直前，不畏险阻，攀登上去，总能越来越接近，暂时的“不能至”就会转化为“能至”。如果连“向往”之心也没有，“不能”就会永远是个“不能”。
    有人把立大志和“吹牛皮”混为一谈，这是天大的误解。大志是根据客观和主观的各种条件立在坚实的基础上的，是要用切实有力的行动去争取实现的。“吹牛皮”不是靠力气，而是靠“空气”；不是要行动，只是要嘴巴；不是实事求是，而是哗众取宠。两者如此不同，为什么又会被某些人混为一谈呢？这是因为它们之间外貌有相似之处。相似的地方只在于：同样是宣称要做到前人远没有做到、自己目前也还没有做到的事情。这是一种现象，而不是本质。现象和本质是有联系的，也是有区别的。只有通过现象才能看到本质；可是，只通过个别的孤立的片面的现象也往往看不到本质。要从本质上区别立大志和“吹牛皮”，其实也并不困难。最要紧的一点，就是把言词和行动联系起来看看。只要是在定下目标之前对条件作了比较全面的分析，在定下目标之后又鼓足干劲往前奔，那就只能说是立了大志；即使作了一番努力没有达到预定的目标，谁也不能说这就是“吹牛皮”。现实生活里的人不是童话里的神仙，对没有来到的事情怎能预计得分厘不差呢！只要比原有的水平大大提高了，就是可喜可庆的事。既不能视为是“牛皮”吹破了，也不能认为是“失败”。更何况，一番努力达不到，还可以作二番、三番以至更多番努力呢！当然，如果是光说不干，那末，不论是“夸下海口”还是只夸下一个“井口”，都得认为是“吹牛皮”，是“假把戏”。
    年纪大了，立志是不是就晚了？当然，立志越早越好。最初就有大志，就有更多的机会把底子打得更宽广更结实，就可能在这基础上建立较高的楼台。可是，如果从小没有立志，到中年立志也不为晚。苏老泉（苏洵）不是中年时代才发愤为学的吗？他在文学上终于也有了相当高的成就。到老年立志也还是大有可为。不是有五十多岁的老大娘在去年也参加识字班、摆脱了文盲状态吗？种庄稼也是如此。最好在头冬就为下一年的大丰收立下大志，至少在播种之前就立下大志。到作物生长中期，仍然可以立大志争高产。到了作物生长后期，也决不是就无志可立了。直到打场、入仓，只要多加一分努力，就能多得一分效果。
    志要不断地立，不断提高。最初立下的志，经过一番努力达到了，就要立更高的志，决不可“踌躇满志”。志一“满”，一“踌躇”，一松劲，就坏了；不但不能继续前进，还会堕落下去。向高峰攀登，手一松，腿一软，那是多么危险的事！去年增产了，今年就要提出更高的增产目标；夏季增产了，秋季就要提出更高的增产目标。耕好了，还要种得好；种好了，还要管得好；管好了，还要收得好；收好了，还要卖得好、交得好、送得好、分得好、藏得好、用得好。学习，也是如此。先要定下攀登科学的高峰的总目标；在学习过程中，还要一段一段定下不断提高的具体目标。不但在一个目标达到了的时候要立即定出下一个目标；并且要在一个目标达到之前就及早提出一个更高的奋斗目标。这样就会更加主动，就可能使当前的行动更有劲，而且能适应过渡到更高阶段的趋势。“伟大的毅力产生于伟大的目的。”“伟大的目的”也就是大志，它有两方面的意义：一、为了集体，为了全民，为了远大的未来，为了社会主义和共产主义；而不是为了个人，为了少数人，为了眼前的一寸之地，为了私人的欲望。二、争取高速度，争取高指标，争取“满堂红”，争取最大最好的成果。两方面都不可缺少，前者更是起决定作用的。如果只是出于个人私欲，那末，即使野心再“大”，也是极其渺小的。为了这样的目的，就不可能有很大的干劲；即使偶而表现出来似乎有很大的干劲，也不可能持久。为什么有的人在大跃进的浪潮中老是动摇？为什么有的曾经在浪头上的人也会一下子淹没在水底？为什么有的人“吹劲”挺大而干劲很小？原因可能很多；可是，最重要的原因，还是要在这里来寻找。
    卑鄙的个人主义者，潜入革命队伍的投机分子，只因为一时少吃一点猪肉也会动摇，摇身一变而现出原形。有崇高志向的英雄的劳动人民，在任何困难面前也不动摇。立志要改变“一穷二白”的面貌的英雄人民，在洪水暴发、一片汪洋的情况下，在赤日炎炎、百日大旱的情况下，“人定胜天”的信念也是坚定的。江苏溧水县今年受旱一百三十多天；可是这个县的各个人民公社仍然立下大志，要把灾年变成丰年，力争粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年再增产15％。全江苏省受旱严重的丘陵山区人民，都响应涟水人民的倡议，立下大志：受灾不见灾，超产再超产！这是何等气概！
    只要目的真正是伟大的（无私的，无畏的），鼓足干劲做去，总能达到，而且能够用比较快的速度达到。密云水库的二十万建设者立下了大志，原来需要六、七年才能建成的浩大的工程，一年就完成了70％，开始拦住了雨季时常为害的潮白河的汹涌的洪水。人民大会堂的一万四千名建设者立下了大志，十个月就把比北京故宫的全部有效建筑面积还大的一座庄严宏伟的大建筑矗立在天安门前。为了伟大的祖国，为了伟大的集体，为了伟大的目的，人们用巨大的力量和智慧，战胜了巨大的艰险和困难。革命干劲和科学精神在这里合而为一。这是真正的“落实”；要“落实”，就要这样“落”法。“指标越低越好”，这是泄气，不是落实。没有大志，没有在大志的指导和鼓舞下的英勇的行动，就只可能“落空”，不可能落实。——无志者，万事空；有志者，事竟成。
