　　Increase Production and Practice Economy Through Economic Accounting
　　Bai Rubing, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC

    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called on the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to deeply carry out a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to strive in every possible way to complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction plans. After the Party's call was issued, it was warmly supported by the whole Party and the people, and a new upsurge of opposing rightism, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy was immediately set off throughout the country. Like the people of the whole country, the people of Shandong Province are high-spirited and full of vigor, their production enthusiasm is constantly rising, and their enthusiasm is growing. The Party's great call has been transformed into a huge material force, and the magnificent mass movement has promoted the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. The average daily output of iron in the province in early September was 4,913 tons, in mid-September it was 5,624 tons, and in late September it was 6,367 tons, with the highest daily output reaching 6,880 tons; the average daily output of steel in early September was 743 tons, in mid-September it was 910 tons, and in late September it was 1,113 tons, with the highest reaching 1,129 tons; the daily output of steel, coke, and ore in late September increased by 54% to more than double compared with early September. The province's daily coal output in early September was 63,106 tons, in mid-September it was 68,373 tons, and in late September it was 75,081 tons; the highest reached 78,152 tons. In addition, the production of machinery, electricity, textiles, light industry, transportation, basic construction, and other aspects has also been significantly improved. On the agricultural front, production efficiency has been greatly improved, and this year's production plans have been generally revised and improved. The management of autumn fields and the progress of autumn plowing are both very fast. Recently, more than 10 million mu of sweet potato fields in the province have been top-dressed. While increasing production, practicing economy has also become the practical action of the broad masses. In the second half of the year, 1 million tons of coal, 7,000 tons of steel, 60,000 to 70,000 cubic meters of wood, 16,000 tons of cement, and 4,650 tons of gasoline and diesel will be saved. Product costs and circulation costs will also be reduced more significantly. Facts have once again proved that the general line of building socialism put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is completely correct. It proves that adhering to putting politics in command and fully mobilizing the masses in economic construction, and realizing the leap forward in various undertakings through vigorous mass movements is completely correct. It proves that the people's communes have great vitality in promoting the rapid leap forward of China's socialist construction, and also proves that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are completely correct.

    Increase Production and Practice Economy Must Be Achieved Through Economic Accounting

    Increasing production and practicing economy is the basic policy for building socialism in China with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. China is a large country with 650 million people, but it is also an economically backward poor country. The old face of "poverty and blankness" has not been fundamentally changed. In order to change China's old face of "poverty and blankness" more quickly and build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible, we must strive to increase production, give full play to our subjective initiative, go all out, and strive to increase the production of more and better industrial and agricultural products and complete higher and better construction work under the existing human, material, and financial resources. While striving to increase production, we must also actively practice economy. Practicing economy is an important measure to ensure rapid increase in production. Practicing economy can make rational use of all human, material, financial, and time resources in all aspects as much as possible, and achieve the greatest economic results with the least consumption. Economy is an important source of socialist accumulation and an important means of rationally using accumulation. It is one of the basic principles of managing the socialist economy. Only by vigorously increasing production and practicing economy can we continuously increase socialist accumulation and continuously expand socialist reproduction, and accelerate socialist construction. As pointed out in the "Resolution on Launching the Campaign to Increase Production and Practice Economy" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "While vigorously increasing production, we must vigorously practice economy. Increasing production on the one hand and practicing economy on the other hand, building the country diligently and frugally, running people's communes diligently and frugally, running all enterprises and undertakings diligently and frugally, and managing households diligently and frugally is the way to make our country rich and strong, and it is also the key to striving to complete and overfulfill this year's plan."

    In socialist enterprises, increase production and practice economy is achieved through economic accounting. What is economic accounting? Economic accounting is the form of planned management of the economy by socialist enterprises. It uses currency to measure the consumption and results of enterprise economic activities, uses the enterprise's own income to offset expenditures, and ensures production profitability. Specifically, economic accounting is to calculate the consumption of raw materials, materials, fuel, and tools, machine depreciation, equipment maintenance, wages, and all other production expenses, calculate the product sales revenue, compare expenses and income, and see whether the management is reasonable, whether it is losing money or making money. This also means that each economic department and economic unit independently engages in economic activities within a certain scope, so that they have the responsibility and obligation to best complete the task, and are concerned about their own operating results from the perspective of material interests, so as to give play to the enterprise's operating enthusiasm, achieve diligent and frugal operation of enterprises, and ensure production profitability. However, socialist economic accounting is fundamentally different from capitalist "accounting." Socialist economic accounting must be closely integrated with politics and economy, and must calculate not only economic accounts, but also political accounts, and economic accounts must be subordinate to political accounts; it must calculate not only small accounts, but also large accounts, and the enterprise's small accounts must be subordinate to the state's large accounts. Any purely pursuing profitability, not obeying the Party's centralized leadership, and capitalist management thinking and practices that undermine the state's unified plan are incompatible with the essence of socialist economic accounting and are resolutely opposed by us. The role of socialist economic accounting is not only to record all the activities of the enterprise in the links of production, supply, and product sales, which is convenient for timely analysis of the enterprise's implementation of the greater, faster, better, and more economical results policy in completing the state plan, timely detection of problems, and solving problems, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan; it can also promote the enterprise's workers and masses to constantly care about production, constantly tap potential, improve equipment utilization rate, improve labor productivity, improve product quantity and quality, carefully calculate, save funds, save the use of raw materials, reduce production costs, and produce more and better products with the least consumption of human, material, and financial resources; it can also timely discover the differences between the advanced and the backward, and promote the socialist competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. It can be seen that economic accounting is a powerful weapon to ensure that enterprises use human, material, and financial resources reasonably and economically, and is a powerful weapon to promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and ensure that enterprises continuously improve labor productivity and complete and overfulfill the state plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, economic accounting is by no means a simple and passive calculation of accounts, but reflects the Party's guidelines and policies in every account, and is directly related to socialist production and construction. Under no circumstances in any unit should the role of economic accounting be belittled, weakened, or denied, but it should be good at using it, consolidating it, and strengthening it, so that it can better serve socialist production and construction.

    Our Party and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to economic accounting. As early as in the "Economic Problems and Financial Problems" written by Chairman Mao during the Anti-Japanese War, he pointed out: It is necessary to "establish an economic accounting system to overcome the chaotic state within each enterprise. ... Only with a strict accounting system can we thoroughly examine whether the operation of an enterprise is beneficial." The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "In both production and basic construction, it is necessary to practice economy, carefully calculate, and make rational use of human, material, and financial resources as much as possible, reduce costs, reduce expenses, and increase income." And put forward to us the requirement that "economic work must be done more and more carefully." In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, economic accounting work has been greatly developed in China's socialist construction. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party committees at all levels have further attached importance to and strengthened the specific leadership of economic accounting work, implemented putting politics in command in economic accounting work, and established the viewpoint of serving the development of production; the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" management system has been universally implemented in enterprises, and the workers and masses have been widely absorbed to participate in production management and economic accounting, and "team economic accounting" has been promoted.
  "Economic activity analysis meetings" and "final account meetings" have made a new situation in the operation and management of enterprises. Production has continued to develop, and costs have continued to decline. Taking Shandong Province as an example, during the first five-year plan period, the cost of local state-owned enterprises decreased by an average of 8.32% per year, 9.69% in 1958 compared with 1957, and the cost of comparable products of industrial enterprises from January to August this year decreased by 11.71% compared with 1958; the total cost of the transportation industry decreased by 16.69%; and the commercial circulation cost decreased by 3.35%, thereby accumulating a large amount of construction funds for the country, supporting the country's key construction, and opening up a broad road for more extensive and in-depth economic accounting in the future.

    However, it should also be seen that some enterprises have not fully used economic accounting as a tool to mobilize all positive factors, give full play to all potentials, and better serve the increase of production and the cause of construction. In the state-owned enterprises in Shandong Province, the time for implementing economic accounting is not short, but some enterprises have not yet established a necessary accounting system; at the same time, in various enterprises, the utilization of human, material, and financial resources and the reduction of costs are still very unbalanced. In the steel industry production, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in Qingdao in September has reached 1.49 on average, while the province's average is only 1.07. If the average utilization coefficient is generally increased to the level of Qingdao, 216,400 tons of pig iron can be produced in the fourth quarter of this year. In ironmaking, the ratio of iron to coke in Qingdao in September averaged 0.9, while the province averaged 1.18. If the advanced level of Qingdao can be generally achieved, 154,000 tons of coke can be saved in the fourth quarter of this year. In light industry production, the oil yield of vegetable oil is the highest at 42.42%, and the province averages 41.74%. If all can reach the highest level, 1,498 tons of oilseeds can be saved and 635 tons of vegetable oil can be produced in the province in the fourth quarter of this year. Moreover, the above-mentioned advanced level is only relative. It is advanced in Shandong Province, but it may be general in the whole country. It is advanced today, but it may be backward tomorrow. Advanced and backward are always present, and potential is always inexhaustible. If we can vigorously increase production while practicing economy, strengthen economic accounting, and try our best to fully tap these potentials, then we can greatly reduce costs while obtaining high quality and high yield, and obtain greater economic results with less consumption.

    Criticize Several Erroneous Views on Economic Accounting

    The reason why these potentials have not been tapped early and fully is certainly due to some objective reasons, but the main reason is that some of our cadres have certain right-leaning and one-sided views in their thinking. In addition to comprehensively understanding and implementing the Party's policy of "greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and "building the country diligently and frugally, running enterprises diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally," it is also necessary to correct the understanding of economic accounting. Some people think that economic accounting is dispensable, and they say: "Anyway, it's all the state's, 'the meat rots in the pot', what kind of account is calculated?" Obviously, this view is one-sided and wrong, and its essence is to deny or belittle the role of economic accounting. It should be recognized that economic accounting is the objective requirement of socialist economic development. Only by implementing economic accounting can the socialist economy be managed in a planned way. Facts have proved that using it will promote the development of production, otherwise it will hinder the development of production. Chairman Mao told us in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Rural Areas": "Any socialist economic undertaking must pay attention to making the fullest possible use of manpower and equipment, improving labor organization, improving business management, and improving labor productivity, saving all possible savings in manpower and material resources, implementing labor competition and economic accounting, so as to reduce costs year by year, increase personal income, and increase accumulation." Therefore, economic accounting is not something dispensable, but is necessary for the socialist economy. The idea that "it's all the state's, 'the meat rots in the pot'" is actually an irresponsible manifestation of state property. Because the state entrusts a part of its property to an enterprise for operation, its purpose is to increase production and increase accumulation, so as to expand socialist reproduction and improve the people's material and cultural life. Lenin once said: "Each trust and enterprise is established on the basis of economic accounting system, precisely to make them responsible for themselves, and fully responsible, so that their enterprises do not lose money." ("Lenin's Complete Works", Vol. 35, p. 549) Therefore, strengthening economic accounting, on the basis of high quality and high yield, and under the premise of obeying the state plan, striving to reduce costs and strive for more profits has always been one of the primary tasks of each enterprise, and it is also an important sign to test the level of business management of an enterprise and the implementation of the Party's policy of "greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and "building the country diligently and frugally, running enterprises diligently and frugally."

    Some people separate or oppose putting politics in command and mass movements from economic accounting, which is obviously also wrong. It must be affirmed that politics is the soul, the lifeline of all work, and the fundamental guarantee for doing all work well. This is also the case for doing a good job in economic accounting. Any purely technical viewpoint that is divorced from the Party's leadership, divorced from putting politics in command and mass movements, and regards economic accounting as "omnipotent" is extremely wrong. However, to carry out socialist construction, it is still not enough to rely solely on political enthusiasm without meticulous economic work. Therefore, we must also do a good job in economic work and economic accounting. Lenin once said that to build socialism and lead millions of people to communism, "it is not directly relying on enthusiasm, but by means of the enthusiasm generated by the great revolution, ... relying on economic accounting." ("Lenin's Complete Works" Vol. 33, p. 39) As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Mao also told us: "We should not only be able to run politics, military affairs, Party affairs, and culture, but we should also be able to run the economy. If we are capable of everything, but are incompetent in economics, then we are a group of useless people, we will be overthrown by the enemy, and we will be in danger of extinction." ("Economic Problems and Financial Problems", Jiefang Publishing House, 1944 edition, pp. 203-204) Politics and economics are unified. Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. Adhering to putting politics in command and relying on the masses is precisely to strengthen economic accounting work, so that economic accounting work has a solid mass base, and that economic accounting work has purposefulness, that is, to serve politics.

    Some people believe that the production task is completed, and the cost will naturally be reduced, thus denying the role of economic accounting, which is also incorrect. Indeed, doing a good job in production is the regular central task of the enterprise. Only when production is done well, and the production task is completed and overfulfilled, can we provide a reliable material basis for better implementing economic accounting and achieving cost reduction. However, if we only pay attention to production and not to economy, and do not pay attention to economic accounting, even if the production task is completed, the desired effect cannot be achieved, and even some waste and confusion in production management will be caused. For example, the brick and tile factory in Jiaonan County, this year's output value in the first half of the year has increased several times compared with the same period last year, but due to the relaxation of economic accounting and cost management, the coal consumption rate has increased by one time compared with last year, the scrap rate has reached 40%, and the cost has increased by 4.4% compared with last year, resulting in losses. After they checked, strengthened economic accounting and cost management, the situation quickly turned around. In July, the coal consumption rate not only returned to last year's level, but also decreased by 25% compared with last year, the scrap rate decreased to 8%, and the cost decreased by 8.4% compared with last year, turning from loss to profit. This example shows that in production, we must comprehensively implement the policy of "greater, faster, better, and more economical results." It is one-sided to pay attention only to more and faster, and not to better and more economical, or to pay attention only to better and more economical, and not to more and faster. Both will cause losses to state property and have an adverse impact on production.

    Some people think that economic accounting is a trouble, and this view is also unfounded. In fact, on the contrary, although economic accounting requires some specific and meticulous work, this is completely needed by the interests of the Party and the people, and is needed to accelerate socialist construction. Since it is needed, it should not be considered a trouble. If there is no economic accounting, causing chaos and waste, then that is the real trouble. Only by strengthening economic accounting can we grasp objective economic laws, enhance initiative and consciousness in our work, and prevent and eliminate real troubles, so that our work can be carried out smoothly.

    Some people also think that economic accounting is not easy to grasp, and they make economic accounting an idol and mystify it, which is also completely unnecessary. Economic accounting is by no means unfathomable. As long as we are good at learning, and earnestly summarize and exchange experiences, it is completely possible to master and use it.

    Three Basic Conditions for Strengthening Economic Accounting

    So how can we do a good job in economic accounting? In addition to clarifying the important significance of economic accounting ideologically, the key to strengthening economic accounting is that Party committees at all levels, especially enterprise Party committees, should strengthen their leadership over economic accounting, rely on the masses, and establish and improve the necessary rules and regulations.

    First, Party committees at all levels, especially enterprise Party committees, must always pay attention to strengthening their leadership over economic accounting. The Party's leadership is the guarantee for doing all work well. Only with the Party's leadership and putting politics in command can there be a correct direction. Therefore, Party committees at all levels, especially enterprise Party committees, should learn to use economic accounting as a tool, include economic accounting in the Party committee's agenda in the enterprise, and when arranging plans and inspecting the implementation of plans, they should deploy and inspect the implementation of economic accounting. We must always pay attention to educating the workers and masses to build the country diligently and frugally, and run enterprises diligently and frugally, so that it will be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and create an atmosphere of "thrift is glorious, and waste is shameful." At the same time, we must grasp the key points and strengthen cost accounting and the management of working capital. We know that cost is the concentrated reflection of the enterprise's economic activities, and is the most basic and important two links of economic accounting, and the use of working capital is also an important sign reflecting the effect of the enterprise's economic activities. Therefore, strengthening cost accounting and working capital management is of great significance in enterprise production. In order to strengthen the planned management of cost accounting and working capital, we should prepare a cost plan and a working capital usage plan at the same time when preparing a production plan, and when inspecting the production plan, we should inspect the implementation of the cost plan and the use of working capital, so as to timely discover problems, solve problems, and achieve the requirements of "high quality, high yield, and low cost." In order to give full play to the role of economic accounting, we should also pay attention to comprehensively implementing policies from the overall situation. We must not only calculate economic accounts, but also political accounts, and not only small accounts, but also large accounts. We must combine local interests with overall interests and immediate interests with long-term interests, and oppose purely profitable viewpoints. We should strictly abide by the state's unified plan and price policy, and strictly fulfill the obligation to pay taxes and turn over profits; while increasing output and saving raw materials, we must not reduce product quality; when improving labor productivity, we should rely on technological innovation and technological revolution, and not only rely on physical strength and prolong working hours, which harms workers' health; while improving equipment utilization, we should pay attention to equipment maintenance and safety; while saving, we should ensure those essential expenses, and we cannot affect production and workers' lives due to savings.

    Second, we must implement the mass line, rely on the workers and masses to promote economic accounting. The workers and masses are the masters of the enterprise. They are directly engaged in the enterprise's production activities, and they are most familiar with the enterprise's production situation. They know best the waste loopholes and the potential for increasing production and practicing economy. They also know best how to eliminate waste and tap potential. Therefore, only by relying on them can we do a good job in economic accounting. In order to widely absorb the workers and masses to participate in economic accounting, while implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" enterprise management system, we should adopt a variety of simple and easy methods and vigorously promote "team economic accounting." Experience has proved that "team accounting" is the best form to absorb workers and masses to participate in enterprise management and do a good job in economic accounting. According to the different situations of various enterprises, the main indicators such as output, quality, and raw material consumption should be placed in the team, and the workers and masses themselves should manage it. The implementation should be recorded and announced by class (group), by person, and by day, and the completion of the planned indicators of each class and each worker should be reflected in a timely manner, and comprehensive analysis should be carried out regularly, closely combined with socialist labor competition and summary and evaluation, commend the advanced, and drive the backward, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can be more advanced. In the implementation of economic accounting, we must also pay attention to combining hierarchical accounting with professional department accounting, and combining mass accounting with functional department accounting, so as to do a good job in the economic accounting of the entire enterprise.

    Third, establish and improve the necessary rules and regulations. Rules and regulations are the norms that guide people's unified activities in social production and life. They are necessary for the orderly organization of production and for the implementation of economic accounting. As the saying goes: "Without rules, there can be no squares and circles." In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, various departments and enterprises have established and improved a number of necessary rules and regulations. In the future, we should continue to consolidate, improve, and strictly implement those reasonable rules and regulations that have been established, and timely revise those unreasonable rules and regulations and establish new rules and regulations according to actual needs in the spirit of having destruction and construction. Especially for the financial management system, various quota management systems, and the use and management of raw materials and tools. When formulating or abolishing each rule and regulation, we must also implement the mass line, mobilize the masses to discuss revisions, and implement them.

    At present, the vigorous new upsurge of opposing rightism, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy that has been formed throughout the country provides extremely favorable conditions for better carrying out economic accounting. As long as our whole Party attaches importance to economic accounting, conscientiously implements the mass line in economic accounting, relies on the masses, and timely summarizes and promotes advanced experience, we will be able to better use economic accounting as a tool, make economic work more and more meticulous, and achieve the greatest economic results with the least consumption of human, material, and financial resources. We will be able to make economic accounting better serve the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and better advance bravely in the brilliant light of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results to build socialism."

　　增产节约与经济核算
    中共山东省委书记　白如冰
    党的八届八中全会号召全党和全国各族人民深入地开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，千方百计地为完成和超额完成今年的生产和建设计划而奋斗。党的号召发布之后，受到了全党全民的热烈拥护，在全国范围内立即掀起了一个反右倾，鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的新高潮。山东省的人民和全国人民一样，斗志昂扬，意气风发，生产情绪不断高涨，干劲越来越大。党的伟大号召已变成巨大的物质力量，波澜壮阔的群众运动推动了工农业生产的迅速发展。全省铁的平均日产量，9月上旬为四千九百一十三吨，中旬为五千六百二十四吨，下旬为六千三百六十七吨，日产量最高达到六千八百八十吨；钢的平均日产量，9月上旬为七百四十三吨，中旬为九百一十吨，下旬为一千一百一十三吨，最高达到一千一百二十九吨；钢材、焦炭、矿石的日产量，9月下旬比上旬增长54％到一倍以上。全省煤的日产量，9月上旬为六万三千一百零六吨，中旬为六万八千三百七十三吨，下旬为七万五千零八十一吨；最高达到七万八千一百五十二吨。其他，如机械、电力、纺织、轻工、交通、基本建设等各方面的生产，也都有了显著提高。在农业战线上，生产效率大大提高，普遍修订提高了今年的生产计划，秋田管理和秋耕进度都很快，最近全省地瓜地追肥即达一千余万亩。在增产的同时，厉行节约也成为广大群众的实际行动。下半年将节约煤炭一百万吨，钢材七千吨，木材六至七万立方米，水泥一万六千吨，汽油、柴油四千六百五十吨。产品成本和流通费用也都将有更大幅度的降低。事实再一次证明了党中央和毛主席所提出的建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。证明了在经济建设事业中坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，经过轰轰烈烈的群众运动来实现各项事业的跃进的方针是完全正确的，证明了人民公社具有推动我国社会主义建设事业飞速跃进的巨大生命力，同时也证明了党的八届八中全会的决议是完全正确的。
    增产节约要通过经济核算来实现
    增产节约是我国多快好省地进行社会主义建设的基本方针。我国是一个拥有六亿五千万人口的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国。“一穷二白”的旧面貌尚未根本改变，为了要较快地改变我国“一穷二白”的旧面貌，早日把我国建成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，就必须努力增产，充分发挥我们的主观能动作用，鼓足干劲，力争在现有人力、物力和财力的条件下，增产出更多更好的工农业产品和完成更高更好的建设工作量。在努力增产的同时，还必须极积地厉行节约。节约是保证迅速增产的重要措施。厉行节约就能在各个方面尽可能合理地利用一切人力、物力、财力和时间，以最少的消耗取得最大的经济效果，节约是社会主义积累的重要源泉，也是合理地使用积累的重要手段。它是管理社会主义经济的基本原则之一。只有厉行增产和节约，才能不断地增加社会主义积累和不断扩大社会主义再生产，加速社会主义建设。正如党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”中所指出的：“在厉行增产的同时，必须厉行节约。一面增产，一面节约，勤俭建国，勤俭办人民公社，勤俭办一切企业事业，勤俭持家，这是我们国家的富强之道，这也是争取完成和超额完成今年计划的关键。”
    在社会主义企业中，增产节约是通过经济核算来实现的。什么是经济核算呢？经济核算就是社会主义企业有计划地管理经济的形式，它是以货币来衡量企业经济活动的消耗和成果，用企业本身的收入抵偿支出，并保证生产赢利。具体地说，经济核算就是算原料、材料、燃料和工具的消耗、机器折旧、设备维修、工资等等一切生产开支的账，算产品销售收入的账，比较开支和收入，看看经营的是否合理，是赔钱还是赚钱。这也就是要每个经济部门和经济单位在一定范围内，独立地从事经济活动，使他们有责任也有义务来最好地完成任务，并且从物质利益上关心自己的经营成果，以发挥企业的经营积极性，做到勤俭办企业，保证生产赢利。但是，社会主义经济核算与资本主义的“核算”根本不同。社会主义的经济核算必须是政治和经济密切相结合，既要算经济账，更要算政治账，经济账要服从政治账；既要算小账，更要算大账，企业的小账要服从国家的大账。任何单纯的追求赢利，不服从党的集中领导和破坏国家统一计划的资本主义经营思想和作风，都是与社会主义经济核算的实质不相容的，也是我们所坚决反对的。社会主义经济核算的作用，不仅可以把企业的生产、供应和产品销售各个环节上的全部活动情况记录下来，便于及时分析企业在完成国家计划中，对于多快好省方针的贯彻情况，及时发现问题，解决问题，保证国家计划的全面完成；同时可以促使企业的职工群众经常关心生产，不断挖掘潜力，提高设备利用率，提高劳动生产率，提高产品数量和质量，精打细算，节约资金，节约使用原材料，降低生产成本，用最少的人力、物力和财力消耗，生产出更多、更好的产品；还可以及时发现先进和落后的差别，推动学先进、比先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛热潮。由此可见，经济核算是保证企业合理地节约地使用人力、物力和财力的有力武器，是推动增产节约运动，保证企业不断地提高劳动生产率，多快好省地完成和超额完成国家计划的有力武器。所以说经济核算决不是简单的消极的算算账，而是在每一笔账中都体现着党的方针路线，都直接关系到社会主义的生产和建设。无论在任何单位任何情况下都不能贬低经济核算的作用，都不能削弱它或者否定它，而应该善于运用它、巩固它和加强它，使之更好地为社会主义生产和建设服务。
    我们党和毛主席，历来对经济核算都是极为重视的。毛主席早在抗日战争时期所著的“经济问题与财政问题”一书中就指出：必须“建立经济核算制，克服各企业内部的混乱状态。……有了严格的核算制度之后，才能彻底考查一个企业的经营是否是有利的。”党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“无论在那一方面的生产中和基本建设中，都必须厉行节约，精打细算，尽可能合理地利用人力、物力和财力，降低成本、节减开支，增加收入。”并向我们提出了“经济工作一定要愈做愈细致”的要求。几年来在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在我国的社会主义建设中，经济核算工作有了很大发展，特别是自1958年大跃进以来，由于各级党委进一步重视和加强了对经济核算工作的具体领导，在经济核算工作中贯彻了政治挂帅，树立了为发展生产服务的观点；在企业中普遍推行了“两参一改三结合”的管理制度，广泛地吸收职工群众参加了生产管理和经济核算，推行了“班组经济核算”、
  “经济活动分析会议”、“决算会议”等，因而使企业的经营管理工作出现了一个崭新的局面。生产不断发展，成本也不断下降。拿山东省来说，在第一个五年计划期间，地方国营企业的成本平均每年降低8.32％，1958年比1957年降低了9.69％，今年1—8月份工业企业的可比产品成本又比1958年降低了11.71％；交通运输业的总成本降低了16.69％；商业流通费用降低了3.35％，从而为国家积累了大量的建设资金，支援了国家重点建设，并为今后更广泛、更深入地开展经济核算开拓了广阔的道路。
    但是，也应该看到，有些企业还没有充分利用经济核算这一工具，去调动一切积极因素，充分发挥一切潜力，更好地为增产节约和建设事业服务。在山东省的国营企业中，推行经济核算的时间已不短，但仍有些企业还没有建立起一套必要的核算制度；同时，在各个企业中，对人力、物力、财力的利用和降低成本的情况也还是很不平衡的，在钢铁工业生产中，高炉的利用系数，青岛地区9月份平均已达到一点四九，而全省平均只达一点零七，如将平均利用系数普遍提高到青岛地区的水平，在今年第四季度即可增产生铁二十一万六千四百吨。在炼铁时，铁与焦炭的比例，青岛地区9月份平均为零点九，而全省平均为一点一八，如能普遍达到青岛地区先进水平，今年第四季度即可节约焦炭十五万四千吨。在轻工业生产中，植物油的出油率，最高为42.42％，全省平均为41.74％，如都能达到最高水平，全省今年第四季度即可节约油料一千四百九十八吨，增产植物油六百三十五吨。而且上述先进水平也只是相对而言，在山东省来说是先进的，在全国也可能就是一般的，在今天是先进的，在明天也可能就是落后的。先进和落后是永远存在的，潜力也是永远挖不尽的。如果我们能够在努力增产的同时，厉行节约，加强经济核算，想尽千方百计，充分挖掘这些潜力，那末我们就可以在获得优质高产的同时，更大幅度的降低成本，用更少的消耗获得更大的经济成果。
    批判对经济核算的几种错误观点
    这些潜力之所以没有及早地、充分地挖掘出来，这固然有些客观原因，但主要的还是由于我们某些干部在思想认识上存在着某些右倾和片面的观点。这里除了需要全面领会和贯彻党的“多快好省”和“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业”的方针以外，还必须端正对经济核算的认识。有人认为经济核算是可有可无的东西，他们说：“反正都是国家的，‘肉烂在锅里’，算的什么账？”显然，这种看法是片面的，错误的，其实质是否定或贬低经济核算的作用。应该认识，经济核算是社会主义经济发展的客观要求。只有实行经济核算，才能有计划地管理社会主义经济。事实证明，运用了它就会推动生产的发展，否则就会妨碍生产的发展。毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中告诉我们说：“任何社会主义的经济事业，必须注意尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，尽可能改善劳动组织、改善经营管理和提高劳动生产率，节约一切可能节约的人力和物力，实行劳动竞赛和经济核算，借以逐年降低成本，增加个人收入和增加积累”。所以经济核算不是什么可有可无的东西，而是社会主义经济所必需的。那种认为“都是国家的，‘肉烂在锅里’”的想法，实际上是对国家资财不负责任的一种表现。因为国家把一部分资财交给一个企业经营，其目的是为了增加生产，增加积累，以便扩大社会主义再生产，改善人民的物质文化生活。列宁曾说过：“各个托拉斯和企业建立在经济核算制基础上，正是为了要他们自己负责，而且是完全负责，使自己的企业不亏本。”（“列宁全集”，第35卷，第549页），所以，加强经济核算，在优质高产的基础上，在服从国家计划的前提下，努力降低成本，争取更多的赢利，始终是每个企业经常的首要任务之一，也是检验一个企业经营管理水平高低、贯彻党的“多快好省”、“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业”方针好坏的重要标志。
    有人把政治挂帅、群众运动与经济核算分离开来或对立起来，显然也是不对的。必须肯定，政治是灵魂，是一切工作的生命线，是搞好一切工作的根本保证。对搞好经济核算工作来讲也是如此。任何脱离党的领导、脱离政治挂帅和群众运动，把经济核算看成是“万能”的单纯技术观点都是极端错误的。但是，要进行社会主义建设，单凭政治热情，没有细致的经济工作也还是不行的。因此，我们还必须做好经济工作，做好经济核算。列宁曾说过，要建成社会主义，并把千百万人引向共产主义，“不是直接依靠热情，而是借助于伟大革命所产生的热情，……依靠经济核算。”（“列宁全集”第33卷，第39页）毛主席早在抗日战争时期也告诉我们说：“我们不但应该会办政治、会办军事、会办党务、会办文化，我们也应该会办经济。如果我们样样能干，惟独对于经济无能，那我们就是一批无用之人，就要被敌人打倒，就要陷于灭亡。”（“经济问题与财政问题”，解放社，1944年版，第203—204页）政治和经济是统一的。政治是经济的集中表现，坚持政治挂帅和依靠群众，正是为了加强经济核算工作，使经济核算工作有牢固的群众基础，使经济核算工作富有目的性，即为政治服务。
    有人认为生产任务完成了，成本就会自然降低，因而否定经济核算的作用，这也是不正确的。的确，搞好生产是企业的经常的中心任务，只有生产搞好了，生产任务完成和超额完成了，也才能为更好地贯彻经济核算，实现降低成本，提供可靠的物质基础。但是，如果只注意搞生产，不注意节约，不注意经济核算，即便生产任务完成了，也不能达到应有的效果，甚至会造成某些浪费和生产管理上的混乱。如胶南县砖瓦厂，今年上半年产值比去年同期翻了几番，但由于放松了经济核算和成本管理，致使煤耗率比去年提高一倍，废品率达40％，成本比去年提高4.4％，结果造成亏损。当他们检查之后，加强了经济核算和成本管理，情况迅速扭转，7月份煤耗率不仅返回到去年的水平，而且比去年又降低了25％，废品率降低到8％，成本较去年降低了8.4％，由亏本转为赢利。这一事例说明，在生产中，必须全面贯彻“多快好省”方针，只注意多快，不注意好省，或只注意好省，不注意多快都是片面的。都会给国家资财造成损失，给生产带来不利影响。
    有人认为经济核算是一种麻烦，这种看法也是没有根据的。其实恰恰相反，虽然搞经济核算要做若干具体细致的工作，但这完全是党和人民的利益所需要的，是加速社会主义建设所需要的。既然是需要就不应该认为是麻烦。如果没有经济核算，造成混乱和浪费，那才是真正的麻烦。而只有加强经济核算，才能把握客观经济规律，增强工作中的主动性和自觉性，才能防止和消除真正的麻烦，使工作得以顺利地开展。
    还有人认为经济核算不容易掌握，把经济核算偶象化、神秘化，这也完全不必要。经济核算决不是高深莫测的，只要善于学习，认真总结和交流经验，是完全可以掌握和运用的。
    加强经济核算的三个基本条件
    那么究竟怎样才能搞好经济核算工作呢？加强经济核算工作，除了必须从思想上明确认识经济核算的重要意义以外，关键在于各级党委特别是企业党委加强对经济核算工作的领导，依靠群众，并建立和健全必要的规章制度。
    第一、各级党委，特别是企业党委必须经常注意加强对经济核算工作的领导。党的领导是做好一切工作的保证，只有党的领导、政治挂帅，才能有正确的方向。因此，各级党委，特别是企业党委，都应该学会运用经济核算这一工具，在企业中把经济核算工作列入党委的议事日程，在安排计划和检查计划执行情况的时候，应布置和检查经济核算工作的贯彻执行情况。要经常注意对职工群众进行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的教育，使之深入人心，造成一种“勤俭为荣，浪费可耻”的风气。同时，要抓住重点，加强成本核算和流动资金的管理。我们知道，成本是企业经济活动的集中反映，是经济核算的最基本、最重要的两个环节，流动资金的使用情况也是反映企业经济活动效果的一个重要标志。因此，加强成本核算和流动资金管理，在企业生产中有着重要的意义。为了加强成本核算和流动资金的计划管理，在编制生产计划的同时应当编制成本计划和流动资金的使用计划，并在检查生产计划的同时，应当检查成本计划的执行情况和流动资金的使用情况，以便及时发现问题，解决问题，实现“优质、高产、低成本”的要求。为了充分发挥经济核算的作用，还应该注意从全局出发，全面贯彻政策。既要算经济账更要算政治账，既要算小账更要算大账，必须很好地把局部利益与整体利益、眼前利益与长远利益结合起来，反对单纯的赢利观点。应该严格遵守国家的统一计划和价格政策，厉行缴纳税收和上缴利润的义务；在提高产量、节约原材料的同时，不能降低产品质量；在提高劳动生产率时，应依靠技术革新和技术革命，不能光靠拼体力和延长工作时间，损害工人的健康；在提高设备利用率的同时，应该注意设备维修和安全；在节约的同时应该保证那些必不可少的开支，不能因节约而影响生产和职工的生活。
    第二、必须贯彻群众路线，依靠职工群众推行经济核算。职工群众是企业的主人，他们直接从事企业的生产活动，最熟悉企业的生产情况，最了解生产中的浪费漏洞及增产节约的潜力所在，他们也最懂得如何去杜绝浪费，挖掘潜力。因此，只有依靠他们才能搞好经济核算。为了广泛地吸收职工群众参加经济核算，应该在贯彻“两参一改三结合”的企业管理制度的同时，采用多种多样简而易行的方式方法，大力推行“班组经济核算”。经验证明，“班组核算”是吸收职工群众参加企业经营管理搞好经济核算的一种最好形式。应根据各企业的不同情况，将产量、质量、原材料消耗等主要指标放到班组，由工人群众自己去管理，将执行情况按班（组）、按人、按天进行记录和公布，及时反映各班组、各个工人的计划指标完成情况，并定期进行综合分析，密切结合社会主义劳动竞赛和总结评比，表扬先进，带动落后，使落后的赶上先进，使先进的更加先进。在贯彻经济核算中，还必须注意分级核算和专业部门核算相结合，群众核算和职能部门核算相结合，从而搞好整个企业的经济核算工作。
    第三、建立和健全必要的规章制度。规章制度是在社会生产和生活中引导人们统一活动的规范。是有秩序组织生产所必需的，也是实行经济核算所必需的。古语说得好：“不以规矩不能成方圆”。近年来在党的领导下，各部门、各企业已经建立和健全了若干必要的规章制度。今后应继续根据实际需要，本着有破有立的精神，巩固提高并严格执行那些已经建立起的合理的规章制度，及时修订那些不合理的规章制度和建立新的规章制度。特别是对于财务管理制度、各项定额管理制度、原材料和工具的使用管理等制度。制定或废除每一规章制度时，也必须贯彻群众路线，发动群众讨论修订，并贯彻执行。
    目前，全国范围内已经形成的轰轰烈烈的反右倾，鼓干劲，厉行增产节约运动的新高潮，为更好地开展经济核算工作提供了极为有利的条件，只要我们全党重视经济核算工作，在经济核算工作中认真贯彻群众路线，依靠群众，及时总结推广先进经验，我们就能够更好地运用经济核算这一工具，把经济工作愈做愈细致，以最少的人力、物力和财力消耗，取得最大的经济效果，就能够使经济核算更好地为增产节约运动服务，更好地在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的光辉照耀下，奋勇前进。
