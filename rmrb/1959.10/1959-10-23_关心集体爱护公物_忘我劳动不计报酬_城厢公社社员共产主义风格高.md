Caring for the Collective and Cherishing Public Property, Selfless Labor Without Regard to Remuneration
The High Communist Style of the Members of the Chengxiang Commune

    (Reported by this newspaper) Due to the expansion of collective ownership, the mental outlook of the members of the Chengxiang Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, has undergone tremendous changes. Here, a selfless labor enthusiasm and a noble communist style are everywhere.

    In order to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan, brigades and brigades, production teams and production teams, in the struggle to overcome natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and pests, have carried out comprehensive cooperation and support in manpower, materials, and finances. For example, the Houyu Brigade has a large canal that irrigates more than 570 mu of paddy fields in the Houyu, Tangbei, and Yanglin production teams. These three production teams were originally three advanced agricultural cooperatives. In the past, because each cooperative was a production unit, and some cooperative cadres and members had localist ideas, they could not achieve planned water use and rational water use, and water disputes often occurred between cooperatives. After the commune was established, the three agricultural cooperatives merged into three production teams of one brigade. Based on the principles of benefiting production and facilitating management, they adjusted the fields and eliminated interspersed fields. In July and August of this year, when the drought was most severe, the flow of the canal was greatly reduced. The Houyu production team in the lower reaches of the canal had 187 mu of paddy fields that were dehydrated and cracked. The water watcher, Li Xiutian, was also ill and unable to go out. Seeing this situation, Li Yuanfu, the water watcher of the Tangbei production team in the upper reaches of the canal, took the initiative to put all the water into the drought-stricken fields of the Houyu production team, and also gave up part of his own team's water, rescuing all of the more than 180 mu of rice that was about to dry up. Soon after, when Li Xiutian was watching the water, he saw that Li Yuanfu was not there, and he also took the initiative to help him release the water, repair the field openings, and plug the leaks, so that this area, which had suffered from drought for many years, achieved a great harvest this year.

    After the establishment of the People's Commune, the connection between individuals and the state has been further strengthened economically, and the relationship between small collectives and large collectives has become closer. This is most prominent in completing the task of purchasing early and mid-season rice. This year, the commune's task of purchasing 4.7 million jin of early and mid-season rice was overfulfilled in just over a week, and all the grain delivered was free of pests, miscellaneous grains, sand, mud, and mildew. The Yangliu production team of the Jiushi Brigade held a mass meeting the night before delivering grain to discuss whether they should deliver good grain and deliver grain early. Everyone believed that delivering good grain and delivering grain early would benefit both the country and themselves. They said, "Without the Party leading us to build the People's Commune, how could we have such a great harvest!" "The worker brothers produce machines, fabrics, and other industrial products for us, all of which are of good quality, and we should also deliver the best grain to them." The next day, all fifty-odd male and female laborers in the team devoted themselves to the grain delivery movement, delivering more than 70,000 jin of grain in one day and one night, and overfulfilling the task of purchasing 150,000 jin by 12% in three days. The early and mid-season rice maturity periods of the production teams in the Gaoqiao Brigade were inconsistent. In order to ensure that the state's procurement task was completed on schedule, the Gaoqiao production team and the Litoushan production team took the initiative to lend grain to the later-season Yuanyue and Xinlongtang teams, and organized labor to help deliver the grain to the state warehouse.

    The growth of the collective consciousness of the commune members is also prominently reflected in the care of public property. Most commune members cherish every tree and blade of grass of the commune and the country as if they were their own belongings. At the end of August this year, there was a major mountain flood that had not been seen in decades. The river water rose sharply, and all seventeen plank bridges within the Chengxiang Commune were washed away. More than 300 cubic meters of sleeper rafts belonging to the commune and the State Forestry Industry Bureau were also scattered by the flood. In the past, if the owner of the sleepers did not pay salvage fees, very few people would go to salvage them. This time it was very different. More than 380 commune members from the Jiushi, Zhangjia, and Chentian brigades living by the river spontaneously organized seven rescue teams to compete with the flood for wood.

    The growth of the collective consciousness of the commune members is also prominently reflected in selfless labor. The communist style of people not bargaining about prices and not counting rewards is growing rapidly with the consolidation of the commune. In the movement to vigorously develop iron and steel, in the upsurge of large-scale water conservancy, and in the days of rushing to harvest and plant, commune members worked day and night, working hard and cleverly. This high-spirited passion for building socialism and soaring drive is precisely the flower blooming from collective ideology and the fruitful result. In mid-June this year, there was a major mountain flood. In the Beiji Brigade, located in a mountainous area, thirteen large mountain ponds, fifty-one dams, and eighteen canals were washed away in one night. At that time, 528 mu of paddy fields (accounting for 25% of the total field area of the team) were flooded, and another six to seven hundred mu were under serious threat. In order to overcome the flood and ensure a good harvest, all 647 young and middle-aged male and female commune members of the brigade braved the rain to rescue, dredge canals, dig ditches, and build dams to block openings that night. Commune member Cao Chengcai and others discovered that the outside of the dam of the Shentang Reservoir had been washed open by a gap of more than six zhang long by the flood. There was no time to carry soil to build the dam. On the one hand, they increased the flood discharge channel, and on the other hand, they ran to their homes and moved all the doors and floorboards to the reservoir. The rain was heavy and the wind was strong, and the torches could not be lit. Some commune members fell down, got up again, and walked with the boards on their backs. In this tense struggle, no one considered work points. All they thought about was how to rescue the seedlings as soon as possible. After four consecutive days of hard work, all the flooded paddy fields were finally rescued, and all the mountain ponds and dams that had been washed away were repaired in the rain. In the past, although the level of awareness of the masses had been greatly improved with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, even in the advanced cooperatives, phenomena such as picking and choosing, only caring about work points, and disregarding quality still existed among some members. Now it is very different. With the change of production relations, the mental outlook of the people has greatly changed in the year since communization. Female commune member Huang Aisu of the Caojia production team of the Xianqiao Brigade is a mother of four children. In the advanced cooperative, she was overwhelmed by heavy housework and could not breathe. She was always silent and taciturn. After communization, she was like a horse freed from its rein, keeping pace with the male commune members, never caring about work points. In order to accumulate more fertilizer, when her children were still sleeping soundly, she gently got up, carried a urine bucket, and ran with a torch to Chengguan Town, two or three li away from her home, to pick up large silt. After carrying a load back, the sky was just dawning, and she immediately took the children to the nursery and kindergarten, and she went to work with other commune members. From April to the end of August, she had already done more than 2,400 work points, averaging eleven or twelve points per day. There are such selfless laborers who do not haggle over work points in every team and every group. Communization has greatly changed the mental outlook of the people.

    关心集体爱护公物　忘我劳动不计报酬
    城厢公社社员共产主义风格高
    本报讯　由于集体所有制成份的扩大，湖南郴县城厢公社社员们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。在这里，到处洋溢着忘我的劳动热情和共产主义的高尚风格。
    为了完成和超额完成今年的生产计划，大队与大队之间，生产队与生产队之间，在战胜水、旱、虫等自然灾害的斗争中，开展了人力、物力、财力的全面大协作、大支援。比如，厚玉大队有一条大水圳，灌溉着厚玉、塘背、杨林三个生产队的五百七十多亩稻田。这三个生产队原是三个高级农业社，过去由于一个社是一个生产单位，加之部分社干部、社员有本位主义思想，不能做到计划用水和合理用水，社与社之间经常发生水利纠纷。公社化以后，三个农业社合并成一个大队的三个生产队，它们本着有利于生产、便于管理的原则，调整了田土，消灭了插花田。今年7、8月间，当旱情最严重的时候，水圳的流量大大减少了；水圳下游的厚玉生产队有一百八十七亩稻田脱水开坼了，看水员李修田又有病在身，不能出门，水圳上游的塘背生产队看水员黎元福看到这个情况，便主动地把水全部放到厚玉生产队的旱田里，还让出了自己队的一部分水，把这一百八十多亩眼看就要干死的水稻，全部抢救过来了。不久，李修田看水时，看到黎元福不在，也主动帮助他把水放好，整修田口，堵塞漏洞，使这个历年受旱的地区，今年取得了大丰收。
    办起人民公社后，在经济上进一步加强了个人和国家的联系，小集体和大集体的关系更加密切了。这在完成早、中稻征购任务方面，表现得最突出。今年全公社的四百七十万斤早、中稻征购粮任务，只一个多星期就超额完成，所交的谷子全部做到了无虫害、无杂谷、无沙泥、无霉芽。旧市大队杨柳生产队在送粮的先一天晚上，队上召开了群众大会，讨论应不应该交好粮、早交粮？大家都认为交好粮、早交粮，对国家对自己都有好处。他们说：“没有党领导我们搞人民公社，哪有这样的大丰收！”“工人老大哥给我们生产出来的机器、布匹等各种工业用品，都是质量很好的，我们也应该拿最好的粮食交上去。”第二天，全队五十多个男女劳动力，全部投入了送粮运动，一天一晚交粮七万多斤，三天就超额12％完成了十五万斤的征购任务。高桥大队各个生产队的早、中稻成熟期不一致，社员们为了保证国家征购任务如期完成，高桥生产队和里头山生产队主动借谷给季节较迟的源阅、新垅塘两个队，并组织劳力帮助送粮到国家仓库。
    社员们的集体主义思想的增长，也突出表现在爱护公共财物方面。大多数社员都像爱惜自家的东西那样爱惜公社、国家的一草一木。今年8月底暴发了几十年未有的大山洪，河水陡涨，城厢公社境内的十七架板桥全部冲垮了；公社和国家森林工业局的三百多立方米枕木木排，也被洪水冲散。在过去，如果枕木主人不出打捞费，是很少有人去打捞的。这次可大不相同了，住在河边的旧市、张家、车田三个大队的三百八十多个社员，自动组织了七个抢救组，与洪水争木。
    社员们的集体主义思想的增长，还突出表现在忘我地劳动上面。人们不讲价钱，不计报酬的共产主义风格，随着公社的巩固在迅速地成长。在大办钢铁的运动中，在大兴水利的热潮中，在抢收抢插的日子里，社员们夜以继日，苦干巧战。这种高涨的建设社会主义的激情和冲天的干劲，正是集体主义思想开出的鲜花，结出的硕果。今年6月中旬，发生了大山洪，地处山区的碑记大队，一个晚上就被冲垮了大山塘十三个、水坝五十一座、水圳十八条。当时有五百二十八亩稻田（占全队总田亩的25％）被洪水淹没，还有六、七百亩受着严重威胁。为了战胜水灾保证丰收，全大队六百四十七个青壮年男女社员，当晚就冒雨抢救，疏圳开沟，筑坝堵口。社员曹成才等十四人，发现深塘水库大坝的外边被洪水冲开了六丈多长的缺口，来不及挑土筑坝，他们一方面加大溢洪道，一方面跑到自己家里把门板、楼板全部搬到水库上来，雨大风大，火把点不亮，有的社员跌倒了，又爬起来，背着板子又走。在这场紧张的斗争中，谁也没有考虑到工分，他们所想的只是如何尽快的把禾苗救出来。一连苦战四天，终于把被淹没的稻田全部抢救了过来，并且冒雨抢修好了所有被冲垮的山塘、水坝。在过去，虽然随着农业合作化运动的发展，群众的觉悟水平有了很大的提高，但是，就是在高级社的时候，挑肥拣瘦、只图工分、不顾质量等现象，在部分社员中还是存在的。如今大大不同了，随着生产关系的改变，公社化一年来，人们的精神面貌大改观。仙桥大队曹家生产队女社员黄爱苏，她是一个有四个小孩的母亲，在高级社时，被繁重的家务拖累，喘不过气来，人总是沉默寡言；公社化后，她真如一匹脱缰的马，与男社员并驾齐驱，从不计较工分。她为了多积肥，当孩子还睡得香甜的时候，就轻轻地爬起来了，挑了尿桶，打着火把，跑到离家两三里远的城关镇去挑大淤。挑一担回来，天还刚刚大亮，随即把孩子们带到托儿所、幼儿园，她又与其他社员们一起出工了。从4月到8月底止，已经做了二千四百多个工分，平均每天作了十一、二分。像她这样忘我劳动，不斤斤计较工分的社员，队队有，组组有。公社化已经使人们的精神面貌大大改变了。
