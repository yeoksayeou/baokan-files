Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement denouncing Lao Kingdom Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 30th, which defended the US policy of intervention in Laos and the actions of US imperialism and the Sananikone government in undermining the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements. The Lao Foreign Minister also slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the United Nations General Assembly for "interfering in Laos" and "invading Laos."

The statement from the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that the truth of the current Lao problem is that, at the instigation of US imperialism, the Sananikone government and the leaders of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" have undermined the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, destroyed the peace and national harmony of Laos, and provoked a civil war; the Lao people and the former Lao Fighting Units have had to engage in self-defense combat to oppose the persecution and suppression policies of the Phoui Sananikone government, oppose the intervention of US imperialism, and demand the strict implementation of the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements.

The statement said that this fact cannot be denied. However, the Lao Foreign Minister used arguments such as "the United States has no designs on Laos" and "the Lao Kingdom government has not violated any international agreements" to quibble. He also slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "interference" in Laos at the United Nations Security Council. The shameless denials of Khamphan Panya and other leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" cannot deceive public opinion and cannot cover up the conspiracy of US imperialism and its lackeys to launch a new war in Indochina. The Lao authorities' clumsy fabrication of false evidence to provide to the United Nations Security Council's "Laos Situation Investigation Subcommittee," which has already been in Laos for twenty days, demonstrates the deceptive nature of the Lao authorities' above-mentioned arguments. The statement also revealed that US imperialism, in violation of the United Nations Charter, sent the so-called Security Council "investigation subcommittee" to Laos in an attempt to exclude the International Commission for Laos, the only international organization with the right to monitor and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The statement said that Khamphan Panya also affirmed that: "The suggestion that the International Commission for Laos resume its activities is only to consolidate the Lao Fighting Units and concentrate them in the two northern provinces, so that they can carry out aggression and subversion activities again from these two provinces." This attitude of the Lao Kingdom government towards the Lao Supervisory and Monitoring Commission not only denies the objectivity of the International Commission's handling of affairs, denies its authority and role, but also exposes the conspiracy of the Lao authorities to find all reasons, even the most absurd, to exclude the Lao International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission, in order to promote activities that undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos and continue to pave the way for US imperialism and the Southeast Asia Military Group to strengthen their intervention in Laos.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again firmly opposes the actions of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government in undermining the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and believes that the unfounded quibbles and rude slander of the Lao Kingdom government's representative at the United Nations General Assembly further prove the vicious conspiracy of US imperialism and the Lao authorities to continue to expand the civil war in Laos and undermine peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam consistently adheres to a policy of peaceful coexistence and has always hoped to establish good-neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos on the basis of mutual respect and strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Lao problem must be resolved in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina, which are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina, and that the activities of the Lao International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission must be restored. In the current situation, the urgent issue is to reconvene the conference of participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to take measures to save the current serious situation in Laos, normalize the Lao situation, and safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

### 越南外交部驳斥老挝外交大臣在联大的发言  诬蔑掩盖不了美萨集团战争阴谋

    越南外交部驳斥老挝外交大臣在联大的发言
    诬蔑掩盖不了美萨集团战争阴谋
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表声明，斥责老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅9月30日在联合国大会发言，为美国干涉老挝的政策以及美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为作辩解。老挝外交大臣还在联合国大会上诬蔑越南民主共和国“干涉老挝”、“侵略老挝”。
    越南民主共和国外交部的声明指出，当前老挝问题的真象是：在美帝国主义的唆使下，萨纳尼空政府和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们破坏了日内瓦协议和万象协议，破坏了老挝的和平和民族和睦，挑起了内战；老挝人民和前寮国战斗部队不得不进行自卫战斗来反对培·萨纳尼空政府的迫害和镇压政策，反对美帝国主义的干涉，要求严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    声明说，这个事实是抵赖不了的。然而，老挝外交大臣却用“美国对老挝没有任何贪图”“老挝王国政府没有违反任何国际协议”等论调来狡赖。他又在联合国安全理事会上诬蔑越南民主共和国“干涉”老挝。坎番·班雅和“保卫国家利益委员会”其他头目的无耻的抵赖论调不能欺骗舆论，不能掩盖美帝国主义及其走狗准备发动印度支那的新战争的阴谋。老挝当局在笨拙地捏造假证据来提供给到老挝已经二十天的联合国安全理事会“老挝局势调查小组委员会”这件事说明了老挝当局上述论调的欺骗性。声明并且揭露，美帝国主义违反联合国宪章，派遣所谓安全理事会的“调查小组委员会”进入老挝，是想排斥有权监察和监督关于老挝的日内瓦协议的履行的唯一国际组织老挝国际委员会。
    声明说，坎番·班雅又肯定说：“建议老挝国际委员会恢复活动只是为了巩固寮国战斗部队，把寮国战斗部队集中到北方两个省，好让他们从这两个省重新进行侵略和颠覆活动”。老挝王国政府对老挝监察和监督委员会的这种态度不但否认了国际委员会处事的客观性，否定它的权限和作用，而且还暴露了老挝当局寻找一切理由、甚至是最无稽的理由来排斥老挝国际监察和监督委员会的阴谋，以便促进破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的活动，继续为美帝国主义和东南亚军事集团加强对老挝的干涉铺平道路。
    越南民主共和国政府再一次坚决反对美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的行动，并且认为老挝王国政府在联合国大会的代表的没有根据的狡赖和粗暴的诬蔑论调进一步证明了美帝国主义和老挝当局继续扩大老挝内战，破坏印度支那和东南亚和平的恶毒阴谋。
    越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地奉行和平共处的政策，一贯希望在双方都尊重和严正履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的基础上同老挝王国建立睦邻关系。
    越南民主共和国政府认为必须根据作为印度支那的和平和安全的基础的1954年日内瓦协议的精神和条款来解决老挝问题，必须恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。在目前的局势下，当前迫切的问题是重新召开1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦会议参加国会议，以采取措施挽救老挝当前严重局势，使老挝局势正常化，以维护印度支那和东南亚的和平。
