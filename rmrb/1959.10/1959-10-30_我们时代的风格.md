    The Style of Our Times
    By Our Correspondent Zheng Boya
    In the torrent of our motherland's surging socialist construction, there are people who, like seagulls, spread their wings and fly in the turbulent waves, burning with an eternal flame of battle, striding with unceasing vigor, constantly shouting to the people: Advance at high speed! These people are the outstanding heroic sons and daughters of the motherland who have recently come to Beijing from socialist construction posts across the country, and who are now gathered in the solemn and magnificent Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, vowing to hold high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction and strive forward towards new goals. These people are humble, simple, and have accomplished earth-shattering feats for the motherland.
    For the past few days, thunderous applause and cheers have resounded thousands of times in the Great Hall of the People. People are cheering the victory of our Party's general line, the victory of the heroes who are creating high speed, and at the same time, people are even more enthusiastically cheering the victory of the communist style that gives high speed its tenacious vitality.
    Our advanced producers are outstanding representatives of this style. These heroes, who can overturn the world and reverse fate, dare to do things that predecessors never dared to imagine. They regard the collective cause as their own lives, they tenaciously kick away all kinds of obstacles on the road to progress, and they always hold high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward. They are able to go through fire and water for the great prosperity of the motherland... Advanced producers, through their collective deeds and personal achievements, bring this style to Beijing to receive the inspection of the Party and the leaders, and to receive the inspection of the motherland.
    There are many such things: some achievements, although they require hard work to achieve, are very common in our country, but are unimaginable to those mediocre people forever. The revolutionary boldness to think and act has led our people onto the path of never-ending creation.
    Jin Caifa is one such person. He, a man who suffered in the old society, has today become a standard-bearer of the Great Leap Forward. He once saw off his youth with lament. He entered a capitalist factory at the age of sixteen and experienced all kinds of hardships in the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. He was beaten by Japanese devils and kicked with leather shoes by British capitalists. He once doubted whether he would ever have happiness in his life. But when he began to live as the master of the country, he became extraordinarily bold. It was he who, on July 22nd of this year, completed a new type of navigational beacon that does not yet exist at home and abroad, which is already his 537th major technical innovation since 1953. Navigational beacons are the guides for ships. How much vast sea area does our motherland have, how many great rivers and long rivers, urgently waiting for electrical navigational beacons to guide the night-sailing ships carrying construction materials back and forth!
    Twenty years ago, when Jin Caifa was a coppersmith in the Shanghai Customs warehouse, he dreamed of having navigational beacons made by himself on the rivers, lakes and seas of the motherland. However, this was just a dream. After liberation, the Party assigned the task of manufacturing navigational beacons to the Shanghai Navigational Beacon Factory. This was precisely when the light beacons on the motherland's oceans were severely damaged, when thousands of ships urgently needed the navigational beacon factory to send them safety and victory, and when imperialism wanted to strangle new China through blockade. Jin Caifa felt that being able to participate in completing this task was his happiness and pride. He and his comrades worked together to complete the acetylene flasher, a success that shocked the Swedish businessman known as the "King of Marine Lights."
    At that time, the navigational beacon factory could not yet manufacture a material called "diaphragm." This news was known to that "King of Marine Lights," who, by chance, told the factory director of the navigational beacon factory smugly: "If you need it, just buy it from us!" This was a challenge, as if we couldn't do without him. When Jin Caifa heard this news, he was almost furious: "Import? I don't agree. The Chinese working class can manufacture it, we can't take this kind of bullying!"
    From that day on, Jin Caifa spent ninety sleepless nights in a row and finally mastered the secret of manufacturing diaphragms. Afterwards, he also reduced the number of parts for the flasher that automatically flashes at night, automatically turns off during the day, and automatically replaces the bulb when it is broken, from 379 to 174, and reduced the weight from 2.15 kilograms to 0.5 kilograms, saving metal raw materials and shortening manufacturing time, so that the new "three-in-one" navigational beacon was born. Jin Caifa boosted the ambition of the Chinese people and destroyed the prestige of the capitalists!
    Our heroes are not only creative people, but they also understand that the socialist cause illuminates the road to happiness for all mankind, and that it is impossible to build this building from the ground up with just beautiful wishes. It requires the concerted efforts of all the people to build it. Therefore, they not only strive to make their activities adapt to the needs of the collective cause, but also try their best to make this cause truly become a collective cause, so that everyone can stand in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. We have thousands of such enthusiastic people. They leave the difficulties to themselves, give the convenience to others, teach their experience to their comrades, and help others catch up with themselves. Their activities are to strengthen the collective force and promote the comprehensive prosperity of the motherland.
    Han Xiufen, a female worker at the Andong Silk Factory, is only twenty-four years old and has always maintained the honor of advanced producer. The "1002" silk she weaves is of good quality and fast speed. Others watch one machine, she watches three, and she can earn more than ninety yuan a month, living a very good life. From her personal point of view, there is nothing more to pursue. However, when the spring breeze of the Great Leap Forward swept across the motherland, she could not calm down. She thought of the progress of the entire factory. She asked the group leader to send her to weave "5001" silk. Because 5001 was an export silk, and at that time, the output and quality were not able to complete the plan. Han Xiufen was very anxious and determined to help them reverse the situation. For this matter, she also found the Party committee secretary. At this time, some people also advised her: "If you go, you won't be skilled, and you may not even be able to earn fifty yuan a month!" Han Xiufen replied well: "Money? I didn't think about it at all, I just wanted to help others weave first-class silk, and that would be a hundred times happy!" The Party committee secretary supported her to go to the group weaving "5001" silk, and after three months of hard work, the appearance of production was completely changed.
    Han Xiufen's spirit is a huge force, because one person's experience will immediately become the experience of thousands of people, and the red flag of the Great Leap Forward will lead more people forward. People have turned this selfless and self-effacing quality into a kind of fashion in their work, and Sun Defu, who is sitting in the assembly, is such a person. He is the captain of the 32137 drilling team. Day after day for ten years, his drilling team has maintained the highest drilling record in the Yumen oil area. When he learned that the motherland especially needed oil, he felt it was his responsibility to help other drilling teams. In August of this year, when their team was far ahead in production, the competing teams 3280 and 3287 encountered complex formations and had weak technical forces, which affected their drilling speed. Sun Defu's heart was as uneasy as the comrades of these two teams. They decided to have the Party branch secretary Luo Chaoyun personally go to these two teams to introduce their experience, and also to transfer the most capable driller of the team, Pang Wanlu, to these two teams to help work, which resulted in team 3280 exceeding their own and also leaping into the ranks of advanced drilling teams.
    Countless people who dare to create, countless people who are good at helping others, are pushing the giant wheel of our cause to roll forward. For people with revolutionary boldness and revolutionary optimism, the road to socialism is broad and smooth; but on the road to climbing the peak of technology, in the struggle to conquer nature, and in the countless days and nights of overcoming difficulties, everyone often encounters arduous tests, and sometimes has to pay a great price. Our people, our advanced producers, have always been fearless of these, although sometimes our cause requires people to sacrifice, or sometimes requires people to use all their energy to do a seemingly very ordinary job. Xu Xuehui, an eighteen-year-old bank teller, once sacrificed her two hands to protect the property of the state.
    She is a teller in a People's Bank in a border area of Yunnan. One dawn this spring, she was alone in the room. Suddenly, six Kuomintang bandits窜过came from the border and broke into the business office to rob. The bandits raised their guns and knives and shouted sternly at Xu Xuehui: "Don't shout, or we'll kill you!" She thought: The 50,000 yuan in the box is the property of the people, the funds for socialist construction, and even if the enemy kills me, I must save it. She fought bravely with the six enemies, suffered eight knife wounds, and had both hands cut off, but still struggled to shout loudly... The people who were responding outside finally came to put out the enemy, and the enemy was unable to snatch a penny. She humbly told people: "I only did a little thing for the Party and the people."
    Among the delegates attending the meeting, there are some who come from so-called ordinary positions. Among them are hotel attendants, canteen waiters, barbers, cleaners, postal and telecommunications workers, warehouse managers, line inspectors... They have always buried themselves in a small job, doing their best. They know that this is also an indispensable part of building socialism, so they love it and do it wholeheartedly. One night in December 1955, the wind roared and the snow billowed, and an ice and snow accident occurred on the long-distance telephone line near Xuzhou, and communications were interrupted. Jiang Bujie, a long-distance lineman, braved the blizzard and selflessly went to repair the line. The utility poles became ice pillars, and the wind and snow made it impossible to open one's eyes. He struggled to reach the line, using all his strength to hold the utility pole with his shoulders, and re-erected the more than 200-jin utility pole. His underwear was soaked with sweat, and his cotton-padded jacket and trousers were frozen stiff. He fought hard for three days and three nights in a row. The stationmaster advised him to rest, but he said: "How can I rest if the line is not repaired?" The stationmaster ordered him to rest, but he still did not leave the front line. At the critical moment of the blizzard, the utility poles he was in charge of remained unbroken. Jiang Bujie patrolled the line day and night, as nervously as a worker next to a steelmaking furnace. He understood that the telecommunications line is the lifeline of communication between the Party and the state, and he regarded his work as a glorious cause related to the happiness of the people of the whole country.
    At the advanced producer representatives meeting, heroic deeds are emerging one after another, and there is no end to them. Because the Party's general line has brought our country into an era of heroes. Our people, our advanced producers, are the heroes who complete the mission of this era. In our country, there are such people everywhere: full of revolutionary boldness, dare to create, and are invincible; always hold high the red flag, are selfless and public-spirited, put others before themselves, help each other, and advance together; full of self-sacrificing spirit, advance bravely in the face of difficulties, and regard the collective cause as life. This is the noble communist style. The more than 6,000 advanced producers attending the meeting have this style, and the nearly 300,000 advanced collectives and more than 3.6 million advanced producers represented by them have this style, and the millions of people linked by the advanced producers - the standard-bearers of the Great Leap Forward - have this style. This is the style of our socialist era, and this is the guarantee that the socialist cause will continue to move forward forever. Nature has spring, summer, autumn and winter. However, the socialist construction cause in our country, led by our Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and supported by millions of people with communist style, will always be the spring of mankind, and will always be the time when the sun rises!

    我们时代的风格
    本报记者　郑伯亚
    在祖国奔腾前进的社会主义建设的洪流中，有一些人，像海鸥一样在汹涌澎湃的大浪里振翅飞翔，他们燃烧着永不熄灭的战斗火焰，迈开着永不停止的雄劲的步伐，不断地向人们发出呼喊：高速度前进！这些人，便是最近来到北京的祖国各地社会主义建设岗位上的优秀的英雄儿女，便是现在聚集在天安门前庄严瑰丽的人民大会堂里，誓师高举社会主义建设总路线红旗向新的目标奋勇前进的人们。这些人，谦逊、质朴，为祖国干出了惊天动地的勋业。
    几天来，人民大会堂里，千百次响起暴风骤雨般的掌声和欢呼。人们欢呼的，是我们党的总路线的胜利，是创造高速度的英雄们的胜利，同时，人们也更加热情地欢呼赋予高速度顽强生命力的共产主义风格的胜利。
    我们的先进生产者，就是这种风格的杰出的代表。这些可以翻天复地、扭转乾坤的英雄敢于做前人从来不敢设想的事情，他们把集体事业当作自己的生命，他们坚韧不拔地踢开前进路上种种障碍，永远高擎起大跃进的红旗，他们能够为祖国的大繁荣赴汤蹈火……。先进生产者们，通过他们集体的事迹和个人的成就，把这种风格带到北京，接受党和领袖的检阅，接受祖国的检阅。
    有许许多多这样的事：有些成就，虽说是要经过艰苦奋斗才可以取得，在我们国家里却很平常，而是那些平庸的人永生不敢设想的。敢想敢干的革命的胆略，把我们的人民带上了永不停止的创造的道路。
    金财发就是这样的。他，这个旧社会的苦命人，今天成了大跃进的旗手。他曾用悲叹送走了自己的青春。他十六岁进资本家工厂做工，在上海这个十里洋场里，历尽了人间艰辛。他被日本鬼子的手打过，被英国资本家用皮鞋踢过。他曾怀疑过一生有没有幸福。但是，当他开始了作为国家主人的生活的时候，变得异常大胆了。就是他，在今年7月22日完成了今天在国内外还没有的一种新型的航标灯，这已是他自1953年以来的第五百三十七件重大技术创造了。航标灯，航船的指路人。祖国有多少辽阔的海面，有多少大江长河，迫切期待着用电气航标，来指引载着建设物资穿梭来往的夜航船舶！
    二十年前，金财发在上海海关仓库做铜匠的时候，就曾梦想过在祖国的江河湖海上，要有自己制造的航标。然而，这只是一个梦想。解放后，党把制造航标的任务，交给了上海航标厂。这正是祖国海洋上灯标遭受严重破坏的时候，正是千万条船舶急需航标厂给它们送去安全和胜利的时候，也正是帝国主义要通过封锁扼杀新中国的时候。金财发感到能参加完成这项任务是自己的幸福和骄傲。他和同志们协作完成了乙炔闪光灯，这个成功曾震惊了号称“海上灯王”的瑞典商人。
    这时，航标厂还不会制造叫皮膜的一种材料。这个消息竟被那位“海上灯王”知道了，一个偶然的机会，他神气十足地告诉航标厂的厂长说：“你们需要，向我们买好了！”这是一种挑战，好像我们离了他不行似的。这个消息被金财发知道了，他几乎气得跳起来：“进口，我不同意。中国工人阶级可以制造，不能受这种气！”
    从那一天起，金财发连续度过了九十个不眠之夜，终于掌握了制造皮膜的秘密。而后，他又把那种在晚上会自动闪光、白天会自动关闭、灯泡坏了还会自动换上的闪光灯，由三百七十九个零件减为一百七十四个零件，重量由二点一五公斤减为零点五公斤，节省了金属原材料，缩短了制造时间，使新的“三合一”航标灯诞生了。金财发长了中国人民的志气，灭了资本主义者的威风！
    我们英雄不但是富于创造的人，而且他们都懂得：社会主义事业，照亮着全人类走向幸福的道路，仅仅有美好的愿望是无法从平地上建设起这座大厦的，需要全体人民同心协力建筑它。因此，他们不但努力使自己的活动去适应集体事业的需要，而且还千方百计地努力使这项事业真正变成集体的事业，使每一个人都站到大跃进的行列中来。我们有千万个这样热心的人。他们，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，把经验教给自己的同志，帮助别人赶上自己。他们的活动是为了加强集体的力量，促进祖国的全面繁荣。
    安东丝绸厂的女工韩秀芬，才二十四岁，一直保持着先进生产者的荣誉。她织的“1002”号的绸子质量好，速度快，别人看一台机子，她看三台，每月可得工资九十多元，生活得很好。从她个人说来，再也没有什么好追求的了。然而，当大跃进的春风吹遍祖国大地的时候，她无法安静下来，她想到整个工厂的前进。她要求小组长派自己去织“5001”代号的绸子。因为，5001是一种出口绸，当时产量质量都完不成计划。韩秀芬心内很焦急，下定决心去帮助她们扭转局面。为这件事她又找到党委书记。这时，也有人劝她：“去了，技术不熟，一个月的工资，怕还拿不上五十元呢！”韩秀芬回答的好：“钱吗，我根本没想，只想帮别人织出甲等绸子，那就是一百个高兴了！”党委书记支持她到了织“5001”绸子的小组，经过三个月的努力，生产的面貌完全改观了。
    韩秀芬的这种精神，是一种巨大的力量，因为一个人的经验会立即变成千万人的经验，跃进的红旗会率领更多的人前进。人们已把这种大公无私、先人后己的品质变成工作中的一种风尚，坐在大会内的孙德福就是这样的。他是32137钻井队的队长。十年如一日，他的钻井队在玉门油区一直保持钻进的最高纪录。当他知道祖国特别需要石油的时候，觉得有责任去帮助别的井队。今年8月，当他们队在生产上遥遥领先的时候，竞赛的对手3280队和3287队遇到了复杂的地层，技术力量弱，影响钻速上不去。孙德福的心里和这两个队的同志一样地不安。他们决定由党支部书记罗朝云亲自去这两个队介绍自己的经验，并抽调队上最得力的司钻庞万禄去这两个队帮助工作，结果使3280队超过了自己，也跃入了先进井队的行列。
    无数个勇于创造的人，无数个善于帮助别人的人，把我们的事业的巨轮推着滚滚向前。对于有着革命胆略和革命乐观主义的人民说来，通向社会主义的道路是宽阔而平坦的；但是，在攀登技术顶峰的路途上，在征服自然的斗争中，在战胜困难的无数个日日夜夜里，对每个人说来也常常遇到艰苦的考验，有时要付出极大的代价。我们的人民，我们的先进生产者，对这些从来是无所畏惧的，虽然有时候我们事业需要人们去牺牲，或者有时需要人们用全部精力去做一件看来非常平凡的工作。十八岁的银行营业员徐学惠，曾经牺牲了自己的两支手保护了国家的财产。
    她是云南边境上一处人民银行的营业员。今年春天的一个拂晓，她一个人在屋内。突然有六个国民党匪徒从边境上窜过来，闯入营业所抢劫。匪徒们枪刀并举，对准徐学惠厉声喝道：“不准叫喊，要不就打死你！”她想：箱内的五万元是人民的财产，是社会主义建设的资金，敌人把我杀死，也要把它保存下来。她奋不顾身地和六个敌人搏斗，身中八刀，两手被砍去，仍然挣扎着大呼大叫……。外面接应的人终于前来扑灭了敌人，敌人没有能抢去一文钱。她谦虚地告诉人说：“我只为党、为人民做了一小点事情。”
    在到会的代表中，有一些来自所谓平凡岗位上的人。他们中有旅馆的招待员、食堂的服务员、理发员、清洁员、邮电员、仓库管理员、巡线员……从来都埋头在一件细小的工作中，尽心尽力。他们知道，这也是建设社会主义不可缺少的一部分，因而热爱它，全心全意去做。1955年12月的一个晚上，狂风怒吼，雪浪翻滚，徐州附近的长途电话线路发生了冰凌倒杆事故，通讯联络中断了。长途线务员蒋步阶冒着暴风雪，奋不顾身地去抢修线路。电杆成了冰柱，风雪打得人睁不开眼。他吃力地走到线路上，倾全身之力用肩膀扛住电杆，把二百多斤重的电杆重竖起来。内衣被汗水湿透了，棉袄棉裤都冻得硬棒棒的，一连苦战了三天三夜。站长劝他休息，他说：“线路没修好，我怎么好休息？”站长命令他休息，他还是不下火线。在暴风雪的关头，他管的电杆，保持着没有断一根线。蒋步阶日夜在线路上巡回着，像工人在炼钢炉旁一样紧张。他懂得电信线路是党和国家的通讯命脉，他把自己的工作，看成是关系全国人民幸福的光荣事业。
    在先进生产者代表会上，英雄的事迹倍出，是说不完的。因为党的总路线已经把我们国家带入了英雄的时代。我们的人民，我们的先进生产者，是完成这个时代使命的英雄。在我们的国土上，到处都有这样的人：充满革命胆略，敢于创造，无往不胜；永远高举红旗，舍己为公，先人后己，互相帮助，共同前进；充满自我牺牲精神，见难勇进，集体事业就是生命。这就是高尚的共产主义风格。到会的六千多名先进生产者有了这种风格，由他们所代表的近三十万个先进集体和三百六十多万个先进生产者有了这种风格，由先进生产者——大跃进的旗手所联系的千百万人有了这种风格。这是我们社会主义时代的风格，这就是社会主义事业永远不断前进的保证。大自然是有着春秋四季的。可是，由我们党和伟大领袖毛主席所领导的我国社会主义建设事业，由具有共产主义风格的千百万人所支持的社会主义建设事业，将永远是人类的春天，永远是旭日东升的时晨！
