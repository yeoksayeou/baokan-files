　　Experience Must Be Summarized Correctly
　　Hong Yanlin
    Just as our Party and the people of the whole country are holding high the red flag of the General Line and summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement with full confidence, certain right-leaning opportunists, under the pretext of "summarizing experience," intentionally collect some "materials" that are supposedly sufficient to reflect the "true situation," and cooperate with the clamoring of hostile elements at home and abroad, wantonly slandering the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement, and attacking the Party and the Party's General Line for building socialism. They turn a blind eye to the great achievements made by the broad masses of people under the leadership of the Party over the past year, but they collect as treasures the errors and shortcomings that have arisen in the Great Leap Forward due to lack of experience and are being overcome or have been overcome, and use them as shells to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. Obviously, they are not summarizing any "experience" at all, nor have they collected any materials sufficient to "reflect the true situation." For them, "summarizing experience" is actually just a guise.
    Standing on the position of the working class and the broad masses, only by proceeding from the purpose of promoting the cause of revolution and construction can we correctly summarize experience.
    As everyone knows, to correctly summarize work experience, we must first have a correct stand and starting point. When we summarize the experience of revolutionary and construction work, only by standing on the Party's position, on the position of the working class and the broad working people, and proceeding from the purpose of promoting the development of the cause of revolution and construction, can our summary conform to the interests of the broad masses of people, and can our summary play a positive role in the cause of revolution and construction. Summarizing the experience of revolutionary work, like other revolutionary work, takes "the greatest interests of the greatest number of people as the highest standard of truth." (Liu Shaoqi: On the Party).
    The Party's General Line for building socialism reflects both the urgent desire of the 650 million people to build our country into a socialist country at the fastest speed, and fully embodies the great determination and great wisdom of all our cadres and masses. It is the only correct line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao based on Marxism-Leninism and the laws of our country's socialist construction work. When we summarize our work, we should first use the Party's General Line to examine the completion of various tasks, affirm the great achievements made in various aspects of work, and study the experience of implementing the Party's General Line in various aspects of work, so as to demonstrate the correctness of the Party's General Line and encourage the broad masses to continue to better complete the leap forward plan under the illumination of the Party's General Line.
    To this end, we should conduct in-depth and specific research on the typical experiences and advanced deeds created by the broad masses in various construction works, and summarize, introduce, and promote them in a timely manner to further promote their enthusiasm and creativity. On the basis of affirming achievements and encouraging the masses, we should then carefully study the problems that have occurred in the work, explore the laws of work progress and development, and then educate cadres and the masses to correctly understand objective laws, give full play to subjective initiative, utilize the favorable conditions in both subjective and objective aspects, and actively create new favorable conditions to overcome the various difficulties and obstacles encountered in the work, so that our work level can be further improved and push the revolution and construction to a new upsurge. Our Party has always advocated seeking truth from facts. Even in the vigorous Great Leap Forward last year, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly told us that enthusiasm and drive should be combined with scientific analysis. When summarizing work, we must also adopt a scientific and realistic attitude and comprehensively analyze the objective situation. On the basis of affirming achievements, the partial and temporary shortcomings that arise in the progress of work must be analyzed and estimated appropriately. When analyzing the reasons for the achievements or the existence of shortcomings, we should also strive to be realistic, say what the reason is, and say what the difficulty is, and avoid observing problems subjectively and one-sidedly, and even more do not allow exaggerating or distorting objective facts. "What is not allowed by the most perfect Marxist dialectics in scientific evolution is precisely the isolated, that is, one-sidedly distorted examination of things." (Lenin: "The Bankruptcy of the Second International and the Struggle for the Third International") If you have ulterior motives and deliberately negate achievements and exaggerate shortcomings, you will not only fail to draw correct conclusions, but also cause damage to our cause.
    Right-leaning opportunists, standing on the bourgeois position and taking a pro-regression attitude towards the socialist cause, can only draw wrong conclusions.
    Right-leaning opportunists, standing on a firm bourgeois position, as a result of long-term detachment from reality and the masses, fundamentally do not understand the fervent desire of the broad masses of people to get rid of the state of "poverty and blankness" and the revolutionary enthusiasm for hard struggle. They intentionally oppose the General Line, oppose the great call of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," and oppose the People's Commune movement. They adopt an unreserved "pro-regression" stance towards the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, although they claim to "summarize experience," they cannot make a comprehensive assessment and realistic analysis of the overall work from their erroneous position and sinister purpose. In this way, of course, they can only draw fundamentally wrong conclusions. It is by no means accidental that they slander the unprecedented feat of tens of millions of people going up the mountains to make steel as a "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement." Such a "summary" will not have the slightest positive significance other than打击striking at the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses,泼pouring cold water on them, and playing a pro-regression role in the cause of revolution and construction.
    When summarizing experience, we must be good at distinguishing between the essence and the mainstream and the non-essence and non-mainstream things.
    The method of summarizing work is completely consistent with the position of summarizing work. With the correct position of summarizing work, we must also adopt the Marxist method of summarizing work. According to the Marxist method of summarizing work, before summarizing work, we must conduct sufficient investigation and research work and collect rich materials as the basis for studying problems. "Detailed possession of materials" is a necessary prerequisite for conducting a correct summary. As Marx said: "Research must collect rich materials, analyze its different forms of development, and explore the internal connections of these various forms. Without first completing this work, it is impossible to have an appropriate explanation of the real movement." In order to have detailed possession of materials, it is necessary not only to collect and accumulate systematic materials on various aspects of the issue, but also to conduct investigation and research work on several typical units; it is necessary not only to collect materials explaining work achievements, but also to collect materials reflecting the problems and shortcomings that exist in the work. After collecting the materials, we should also identify and analyze these materials, distinguish between what is essential and main, what is non-essential and secondary, what is general and regular, and what is local, temporary, and individual. Marxists-Leninists have always taken a serious attitude towards errors and shortcomings in their work, and can promptly and properly overcome and correct them. Lenin once said: We should constantly review ourselves, study the ins and outs of the entire event, clarify the causes and consequences of the matter, and analyze yesterday's mistakes so that we can learn how to avoid today's and tomorrow's mistakes.
    In this regard, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong are our great role models. In the great leap forward of the national economy and various works last year, some local and temporary shortcomings, like small bubbles in the sea, occurred, and the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong discovered and overcame them in a timely manner. As a result, various works have been healthily developed and have achieved great achievements. The purpose of our summarizing work is to improve work and promote our cause. Therefore, only after collecting rich materials, conducting comprehensive and in-depth research on all work, clarifying the ins and outs and causes and consequences of the entire work development, and making an appropriate assessment of all work, can we then analyze the shortcomings prudently and propose methods for improving the work in a practical manner. It should be noted here that in the summary work, any example of errors and shortcomings must be linked to the essence of things to be meaningful. If many instances of shortcomings in the work are collected out of thin air and arbitrarily, without being intrinsically linked to the essence of things, and without being summarized and analyzed, then these instances cannot actually explain any problem. If a shrewd doctor only examines a person's pathological phenomena without examining his overall health, then it is impossible to make a realistic diagnosis of the person's disease, and therefore it is impossible to prescribe the most effective prescription. Only doctors who are proficient in physiology can most effectively understand the pathological phenomena of the human body. It is the same when studying and summarizing practical work. It is impossible to understand the side of errors and shortcomings in the work without first examining the side of achievements and advantages in the work; it is impossible to understand what is "right" without understanding what is "wrong." It is by no means difficult to collect thousands of pieces of information about errors and shortcomings in actual work in isolation. However, it is of no use to pile up these crude and unrefined materials without identification and analysis. It cannot explain any problem at all. Lenin once said: "In social phenomena, there is no more common and untenable method than arbitrarily extracting some individual facts and playing with examples. It is effortless to list general examples, but it is meaningless or completely counterproductive, because in specific historical circumstances, everything has its individual situation. If we grasp the facts from the entire sum of the facts and from the connection of the facts, then the facts are not only 'better than eloquence,' but also conclusive evidence. If the facts are not grasped from the entire sum, not from the connection, but are fragmented and casually selected, then the facts can only be a child's play, or even worse than a child's play..." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 23, Page 279)
    Chairman Mao once told us: When looking at problems, we should first look at the essential aspect and the mainstream aspect of the problem, and we should not emphasize those non-essential aspects and non-mainstream aspects. Non-essential aspects and non-mainstream aspects should not be ignored, and they must be resolved one by one; but they should not be regarded as the essence and the mainstream, so as to confuse one's direction. The Party Central Committee has clearly pointed out that in all the people's undertakings led by the Party, achievements are always the main thing, while errors and shortcomings are secondary and second-rate, only one finger among the ten fingers.
    For example, the national steelmaking movement last year achieved great achievements. After the national steelmaking effort last year, almost all provinces and autonomous regions established the foundation of a steelmaking industry, either large or small. In particular, after the rectification and improvement in the winter and spring of this year, in addition to the original 18 key iron and steel enterprises, the foundation of more than 20 medium-sized steel plants and more than 300 ironmaking bases has gradually been formed; due to the implementation of the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, an industrial leap forward has occurred, and all walks of life, such as the coal industry, the power industry, the machinery industry, the textile industry, and the transportation industry, have achieved an all-round leap forward under the drive of steel. After undergoing the training of the national steelmaking movement, the political consciousness of the broad masses and their understanding of the Party's policy of walking on two legs in industrialization have been further improved. Needless to say, these general facts about steel prove that the achievements of the national steelmaking movement are the main thing and are unshakable; and the shortcomings, such as the slightly poorer quality of iron produced by some small earthen furnaces and the fact that steelmaking work squeezed some agricultural labor, are of course secondary and are a matter of one finger out of ten fingers. However, the right-leaning opportunists insisted on adopting the method of "attacking one point and disregarding the rest," ignoring the achievements of the national steelmaking movement and specializing in collecting these shortcomings in isolation to prove their erroneous view that "the national steelmaking effort does not pay off," and wantonly attacking the Party's socialist industrialization policy and the Party's General Line. They also claimed that the reason why they collected a large amount of negative information was to "look at the problem comprehensively," "walk on two legs" (both talk about achievements and talk about shortcomings), and "synthesize balance" (others talk more about achievements, while they talk more about errors and shortcomings to "balance" it), which is extremely absurd! These practices, which completely violate Marxism-Leninism, only prove that they have ulterior motives.
    Whether to adopt a positive leadership and enthusiastic support attitude towards mass movements and mass struggles is the key to correctly summarizing experience.
    Our Party has always resolutely implemented the mass line in the cause of revolution and construction, and the tasks in all aspects of work are completed through mass movements and mass struggles. Therefore, adopting a Marxist viewpoint towards mass movements and mass struggles when summarizing revolutionary and construction work is an important key to whether we can correctly summarize work experience. Regarding mass movements and mass struggles, Marxists, on the one hand, completely use a scientific and calm attitude to analyze the objective situation and the objective evolutionary process, and on the other hand, they actively and resolutely recognize the significance of the revolutionary will, revolutionary creativity, and revolutionary pioneering spirit shown by the masses. The great revolutionary teachers are best at promoting the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses in the revolutionary and construction movements, and at summarizing the new experiences of mass struggles in a timely manner to guide the current mass struggles and enrich the Marxist theoretical arsenal. Marx summarized the experience of the Paris Commune and established the famous principle that "the victorious revolutionary masses must smash and destroy the old state machine and replace it with a commune-style truly democratic revolutionary regime in order to organize the working class into a ruling class"; Lenin summarized the experience of communist voluntary Saturdays and wrote the article "A Great Beginning," which powerfully promoted the mass movement at that time. Chairman Mao's summary of the experience of the People's Commune movement over the past year has inestimable great guiding significance for guiding the development of the national People's Commune movement.
    Marxists have always regarded mass movements and mass struggles as an endless source of experience and wisdom, and they often summarize the experience of mass movements and mass struggles and earnestly learn from the masses. Marxists will never, like subjective idealists and mechanical materialists, limit mass movements and mass struggles to a pre-drawn track or a pre-formulated framework, but rather treat mass movements and mass struggles from a practical and developmental perspective. "We do not expect to say that Marx or Marxists can know all the specific situations on the road to socialism. This is nonsense. We only know the direction of this road, and we know that the forces of those classes are advancing along this road. As for the specific practical situation, only when millions of people rise up to fight can their experience indicate it." (Lenin: "From the February Revolution to the October Revolution") Proletarian revolutionaries should be good at standing among the masses, summarizing the experience of the masses, gathering the wisdom of the masses, strengthening the strong leadership of the vanguard over the movement and struggle, "concentrating" it again and again, and "persisting" again and again, so that the movement is gradually improved and gradually deepened. In this repeated cycle, the experience of revolutionary struggle will be more correct, more vivid, and richer each time. As for the deviations and shortcomings that appear in the process of mass movements, they are certainly unavoidable. From a revolutionary point of view, as long as the problems in the movement are discovered and grasped in a timely manner, the crux of the work is found, lessons are learned, deviations and shortcomings are corrected, and the weak links of the movement are strengthened and the leadership is improved, this will create more favorable conditions for the healthy development of the movement. As Chairman Mao often tells us, the deviations and shortcomings in the mass movement will be quickly overcome and corrected in the development process of the movement as the political awareness of the masses gradually increases and the experience of struggle gradually increases.
    Contrary to Marxists-Leninists, right-leaning opportunists have always adopted a bourgeois master-style attitude towards mass movements and mass struggles. What they demand is a mass movement "without any deviations." They point fingers and make comments outside the movement and泼pour cold water on the masses. They never support and value the new sprouts that emerge in mass movements and mass struggles. Therefore, they can never make a correct summary of the experience of mass movements and mass struggles. The attitude of right-leaning opportunists towards the People's Commune movement is like this. The people's communeization is a great social movement of hundreds of millions of peasants, a product of the great development of agricultural production, the great development of farmland water conservancy construction, and the great upsurge of the socialist consciousness of peasants demanding expanded cooperation. However, when examining the issue of the People's Commune movement, right-leaning opportunists completely ignored the superiority of the People's Commune and the revolutionary enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity shown by the broad masses of peasants in the People's Commune movement. They clung to the localized and temporary shortcomings that had already been resolved and overcome in the movement and maliciously exaggerated them. This inevitably led them to the absurd conclusions that "the People's Commune lacks an objective material foundation, is not a product of objective necessity, but only a product of the subjective wishes of a few people, and was started by a few people," "the People's Commune was done too early, too fast, and too badly," and so on.
    It is very clear that only by earnestly studying the great example of the proletarian revolutionary teachers in summarizing revolutionary experience, adopting an attitude of enthusiastic support and active leadership towards the revolutionary movements and revolutionary struggles of the people, and analyzing and generalizing the new experiences created by the broad masses in the movements and struggles from a Marxist perspective can we make a correct summary of mass movements and mass struggles and make a correct summary of all aspects of work in the cause of revolution and construction.

### 必须正确地总结经验

　　必须正确地总结经验
　　洪彦林
    正当我们党和全国人民高举总路线的红旗，满怀信心地总结大跃进与人民公社运动的经验的时候，某些右倾机会主义分子，借口“总结经验”，有意搜集一部分据说是足以反映“真实情况”的“资料”，配合国内外敌对分子的叫嚣，肆意污蔑大跃进和人民公社运动，攻击党和党的建设社会主义总路线。他们对一年来广大人民在党领导下所取得的伟大成绩置若罔闻，而对于大跃进中由于经验缺乏而产生的、正在克服或已经克服了的错误和缺点，则如获至宝地尽量搜罗，当作向党猖狂进攻的炮弹。显然，他们并不在总结什么“经验”，他们也并没有搜集到什么足以“反映真实情况”的资料。对于他们来说，“总结经验”实际上不过是一个幌子而已。
    站在工人阶级和广大群众立场上，从促进革命与建设事业的目的出发才能正确地总结经验
    大家知道，正确地总结工作经验，首先必须有正确的立场和出发点。我们总结革命与建设工作的经验时，只有站在党的立场上，站在工人阶级与广大劳动人民的立场上，从促进革命与建设事业发展的目的出发，才能使我们的总结符合于广大人民的利益，才能使我们的总结对革命与建设事业发挥积极的作用。总结革命工作的经验，也同其它各项革命工作一样，“最广大人民的最大利益，即是真理的最高标准。”（刘少奇：论党）。
    党的建设社会主义的总路线，既反映了六亿五千万人民要求以最快速度在我国建成社会主义的迫切愿望，也充分体现了我们全体干部和群众的伟大决心和伟大智慧。它是党中央和毛主席根据马克思列宁主义与我国社会主义建设工作的规律所制定的唯一正确的路线。我们在总结工作时，首先应当根据党的总路线来考察各方面工作任务完成的情况，肯定各方面工作中所取得的伟大成绩，研究在各方面工作中贯彻执行党的总路线的经验，从而论证党的总路线的正确性，鼓舞广大群众在党的总路线的照耀下继续更好地完成跃进计划。
    为此，我们应当深入具体地研究广大群众在各方面建设工作中所创造的典型经验和先进事迹，及时地加以总结介绍和推广，进一步发扬他们的积极性创造性。在肯定成绩、鼓舞群众的基础上，再来细心地研究工作中所发生的问题，探讨工作前进和发展的规律，然后教育干部和群众，正确认识客观规律，充分发挥主观能动性，利用主客观方面的有利条件，并积极创造新的有利条件，克服工作中所碰到的各种困难和障碍，使我们的工作水平进一步提高，把革命和建设推向新的高潮。我们党从来是主张实事求是的。就是在去年轰轰烈烈的大跃进中，党中央和毛泽东同志也一再告诉我们，热情和干劲要同科学分析相结合。在总结工作时，我们也必须采取科学的和实事求是的态度，全面地分析客观形势。在肯定成绩的基础上，对工作前进中产生的一些局部的和暂时性的缺点，必须恰如其分的分析和估计。在分析取得成绩或存在缺点的原因时，也要力求切合实际，是什么原因就说什么原因，有什么困难就说什么困难，既要避免主观片面地观察问题，更不容许对客观事实加以夸大或歪曲。“科学进化中最完善的马克思底辩证法所不允许的，正是对事物作孤立的，即偏面的畸形曲解的考察”。（列宁：“第二国际的破产和为第三国际而斗争”）如果居心不良，故意否定成绩夸大缺点，不仅不能得出正确的结论，而且会给我们的事业带来损害。
    右倾机会主义分子，站在资产阶级立场对社会主义事业采取促退派态度，只能得出错误的结论
    站在坚定的资产阶级立场上的右倾机会主义者，由于长期脱离实际、脱离群众的结果，根本不理解广大人民群众要求摆脱“一穷二白”状况的热烈愿望和奋发苦战的革命热情。他们有意地反对总路线，反对“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的伟大号召和人民公社运动，他们对社会主义建设事业采取不折不扣的“促退派”的立场，因此，他们虽然口口声声说要“总结经验”，然而从他们错误的立场和罪恶的目的出发，他们就不可能对全盘工作作全面的估计和实事求是的分析。这样当然只能得出根本错误的结论。他们把几千万人上山大炼钢铁的空前壮举污蔑成为“小资产阶级狂热性运动”，当然不是偶然的。那样的“总结”除了打击干部与群众的积极性、向他们大泼冷水，对革命与建设事业起促退作用之外，决不会有丝毫的积极意义的。
    总结经验时，要善于区别本质和主流与非本质和非主流的东西
    总结工作的方法，和总结工作的立场是完全一致的。有了总结工作正确的立场，还必须采取马克思主义的总结工作的方法。根据马克思主义总结工作的方法，在总结工作之前，必须进行充分的调查研究工作，搜集丰富的资料，作为研究问题的根据。“详细占有资料”，是进行正确的总结的必要前提。正如马克思所说：“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析它的不同的发展形态，并探寻出这各种形态的内部联系。不先完成这种工作，便不能对于现实的运动，有适当的说明。”为了详细占有资料，不仅要搜集、积累有关问题的各个侧面的系统资料，而且要进行若干典型单位的调查研究工作；既要搜集说明工作成绩的资料，也要搜集反映工作中所存在的问题和缺点的资料。在搜集资料之后，还应当对这些资料进行鉴别和分析研究，分清那些是本质的主要的东西，那些是非本质的、次要的东西，那些是一般的和带有规律性的东西，那些是局部的、暂时的个别现象。马克思列宁主义者向来对待工作中的错误与缺点是采取严肃态度的，并且能够及时地妥善地克服与纠正工作中的错误与缺点。列宁曾经说过：我们应经常对自己进行检讨，研究整个事件发展的来龙去脉，弄清事情的前因后果，分析了昨天的错误就可以从中学习到怎样避免今天和明天的错误。
    在这方面，党中央和毛泽东同志是我们的伟大榜样。在去年国民经济和各项工作大跃进中，发生了一些像大海中的小泡沫似的、局部性和暂时性的缺点，党中央和毛泽东同志都及时地发现和克服了。因而使各项工作得到健康的发展，取得伟大成就。我们总结工作的目的，是为了改进工作，推进我们的事业，因此，只有在搜集了丰富的资料以后，对全部工作进行全面的深刻的研究，弄清整个工作发展的来龙去脉和前因后果，对全部工作作出恰当的估价，然后才能针对缺点，审慎的分析，并进一步切实地提出改进工作的方法。这里应当注意的是，在总结工作中，对于任何有关错误与缺点的例证都必须与事物的本质联系起来才有意义。如果凭空地随意地搜罗许多有关工作中缺点的实例，而不同事物的本质内在地联系起来，又不加以归纳和分析，那么这些实例实际上是不能说明任何问题的。精明的医生如果只诊察一个人的病理现象而不去考察他的全部健康状况，那么就不可能对这个人的疾病作出实事求是的诊断，因而也不可能开出最有效的处方。只有精通生理学的医生才能最有效地了解人体的病理现象。在研究总结实际工作时也是一样，不首先考察工作中的成绩与优点的一面，也决不可能了解工作中的错误与缺点的一面；不了解什么是“是”，当然也不可能了解什么是“非”。从实际工作中孤立地搜罗成千条有关错误与缺点的资料，决不是困难的事。可是，把这些不经鉴别与分析的生硬粗糙的资料堆积在一起是没有什么用处的。它丝毫不能说明任何问题。列宁曾经说过：“在社会现象方面，没有比胡乱抽出一些个别事实和玩弄实例更普遍更站不住脚的方法了。罗列一般例子是毫不费劲的，但这是没有任何意义的或者完全起相反的作用，因为在具体的历史情况下，一切事情都有它个别的情况。如果从事实的全部总和、从事实的联系去掌握事实，那末，事实不仅是‘胜于雄辩的东西’，而且是证据确凿的东西。如果不是从全部总和、不是从联系中去掌握事实，而是片断的和随便挑出来的，那末事实就只能是一种儿戏，或者甚至连儿戏也不如。……”（“列宁全集”，第二十三卷，第二七九页）
    毛主席曾经告诉我们：看问题首先应当看问题的本质方面、主流方面，而不应当强调那些非本质方面和非主流方面的东西。非本质方面和非主流方面的东西也是不应当忽略的，必须逐一地将他们解决；但是不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。党中央十分明确地指出：党所领导下的一切人民事业，成绩总是主要的，而错误与缺点则是次要的、第二位的，不过是十个指头中的一个指头而已。
    例如，去年的全民炼钢运动是取得了伟大的成绩的。经过去年的全民大炼钢，几乎全国所有的省和自治区，都建立了或大或小的炼钢工业的基础，特别是经过去冬今春的整顿和提高，除原有的十八个重点钢铁企业外，又逐步形成了二十多个中型钢铁厂的基础和三百多个炼铁的基点；由于贯彻执行了以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，出现了工业大跃进，煤炭工业、电力工业、机械工业、纺织工业和交通运输事业等各行各业都在钢铁的带动下实现了全面跃进。经受全民炼钢运动的锻炼以后，广大人民的政治觉悟和对党的两条腿走路的工业化方针的认识有了进一步的提高。不消说，这些钢铁一般的事实，证明全民炼钢运动的成绩是主要的，无可动摇的；而某些小土炉所炼出的铁质量稍差，炼钢工作多挤用了一些农业劳动力等缺点，则当然是次要的，是十个指头里的一个指头的问题。可是右倾机会主义者却硬要采取“攻其一点，不计其余”的手法，撇开全民炼钢运动的成绩不谈，专门孤立地搜集这些缺点，来证明他们的“全民炼钢，得不偿失”的错误观点，大肆攻击党的社会主义工业化方针和党的总路线。他们还声称，他们之所以大量搜集反面资料是为了要“全面地看问题”、“两条腿走路”（既谈成绩，也谈缺点）、“综合平衡”（别人多谈了成绩，他们则多谈错误与缺点来“平衡”一下），岂非荒谬之至！这些完全违反马克思列宁主义的作法，只证明他们的别有用心罢了。
    对群众运动和群众斗争是否采取积极领导热情支持的态度，是能否正确总结经验的关键
    我们党在革命与建设事业中向来是坚决贯彻执行群众路线的，各方面工作任务都是通过群众运动与群众斗争的方式来完成的。所以，在总结革命与建设工作时，对群众运动与群众斗争采取马克思主义的观点，就成为我们能否正确地总结工作经验的重要关键。对于群众运动和群众斗争，马克思主义者一方面是完全用科学冷静态度来分析客观情势与客观进化行程，另方面是积极坚决地承认群众所表现的革命毅力、革命创造性和革命首创精神底意义。伟大的革命导师最善于在革命与建设运动中发扬群众的革命首创精神，及时总结群众斗争的新经验来指导当前的群众斗争和充实马克思主义的理论武库。马克思总结了巴黎公社的经验，确立了“胜利的革命群众必须打碎、毁坏旧的国家机器，代之以公社式的真正民主的革命政权，以便将工人阶级组成为统治阶级”这一著名原理；列宁总结了共产党员义务星期六的经验，写成了“伟大的创举”一文，有力地推动了当时的群众运动。一年来毛主席对人民公社运动经验的总结，对指导全国人民公社运动的开展，有不可估量的伟大指导意义。
    马克思主义者向来把群众运动和群众斗争看作是经验与智慧的无穷的泉源，经常通过对群众运动和群众斗争的经验加以总结，认真地向群众学习。马克思主义者决不像主观唯心论者和机械唯物论者那样，事先把群众运动和群众斗争限制在预先划好的轨道或者预先制定的框框之内，而是以实践的观点和发展的观点来看待群众运动和群众斗争的。“我们并不冀图说，马克思或马克思主义者能够知道走向社会主义的道路上的一切具体情形。这是胡说。我们只知道这条道路的方向，知道沿着这条道路前进的，是那些阶级的力量。至于具体的实际情形，那么，只有在千百万群众起来斗争时，他们的经验方能指示出来。”（列宁：“二月革命到十月革命”）无产阶级革命家应当善于站在群众之中，总结群众的经验和汇集群众的智慧，加强先锋队对运动和斗争的坚强领导，一次次地“集中起来”，又一次次地“坚持下去”，使运动逐步提高，逐步深入。如此反复循环，革命斗争的经验就会一次比一次更正确，更生动，更丰富。至于群众运动过程中所出现的偏向和缺点当然是不能完全避免的。从革命的观点看来，只要及时发现和抓住了运动中的问题，找到了工作中的症结所在，得出了教训，纠正了偏向、缺点，并加强了运动的薄弱环节，改进了领导，这就为运动的健康发展创设了更有利的条件。正如毛主席所经常告诉我们的，群众运动中的偏向和缺点，在群众政治觉悟逐步提高，斗争经验逐步增多的情况下，是会在运动发展过程中迅速克服和纠正的。
    与马克思列宁主义者相反，右倾机会主义者向来对群众运动和群众斗争，采取资产阶级老爷式的态度，他们要求的是一个“毫无偏差”的群众运动。他们站在运动之外指手划脚，品头论足向群众泼冷水。他们对群众运动和群众斗争中所涌现的新事物的幼芽，从来不会加以扶植和重视。因此，他们是决不可能对群众运动和群众斗争的经验作出正确的总结来的。右倾机会主义者对待人民公社运动的态度就是如此。人民公社化是几亿农民的伟大社会运动，是农业生产大发展，农田水利建设大发展，农民要求扩大协作的社会主义觉悟大高涨的产物。可是右倾机会主义者在考察人民公社运动问题时，完全无视人民公社的优越性与广大农民在人民公社化运动中所表现的革命热情、积极性、创造性。他们对运动中早已解决了的问题和早已克服了的局部性与暂时性的缺点却啃住不放，恶毒地加以渲染。这就使他们不可避免地得出什么“人民公社缺乏客观物质基础，并不是客观必然的产物，而只是少数人主观愿望的产物，是少数人轰起来的”，“人民公社搞早了，搞快了，搞糟了”等等荒谬的结论来。
    很明显，只有认真学习无产阶级革命导师们的总结革命经验的伟大榜样，对人民群众的革命运动和革命斗争采取热情支持和积极领导的态度，以马克思主义观点来分析和概括广大群众在运动和斗争中所创造的新经验，我们才能对群众运动和群众斗争作出正确的总结，才能对革命与建设事业中各方面的工作作出正确的总结。
