　　Vigorously Grasp Completion, Vigorously Grasp Commencement
　　By a commentator of this newspaper

    Beijing's capital construction departments are launching an autumn battle, striving to commence construction on 1.6 million square meters and complete 800,000 square meters before November 20th. This approach of grasping both completion and commencement in the fourth quarter is a strategic measure to ensure the continuous Great Leap Forward in capital construction.

    Striving to break the "conventional" pattern of high activity at the end of the month, low activity at the beginning of the month, high activity at the end of the year, and low activity at the beginning of the year, and ensuring a continuous and stable increase in production and construction, is a common and important task for all departments on the industrial front. However, capital construction in vast areas is restricted by natural conditions and is seasonal. When winter arrives and the weather turns cold, it becomes difficult to construct outdoors in the northern provinces. In previous years, winter was often the "off-season" for construction in the north, and many construction workers could only participate in winter training and other activities, resulting in a significant waste of labor. After being idle in winter, they would have to rush work in summer and autumn. This year, capital construction departments in various regions have shortened their lines and vigorously focused on finishing projects, achieving great and good results in terms of increasing the number of completed projects and quickly realizing investment effectiveness. However, after a large number of projects are completed, if a batch of new projects are not started in the fourth quarter, the workload in the first quarter of next year may be relatively reduced. If a large number of projects are started only after the spring thaw, it may cause a period of idleness and affect the progress of some projects. From now until the end of November, many areas are neither too cold nor too hot, and the rainy season is over, making it the golden season for construction. At this time, starting a batch of new projects as soon as possible will be even more beneficial. In the south, the construction in the fourth quarter can be closely linked with the first quarter of next year, with continuous upsurges. Further north, after freezing, continue with large-scale winter construction, and then launch a spring offensive next spring, so that capital construction nationwide can develop wave after wave, continuously moving forward. As a result, we can more effectively ensure the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial production.

    The primary task of capital construction departments at present is to vigorously focus on finishing projects and ensure that all important projects to be completed this year are put into production as early as possible. How to properly arrange and coordinate the progress of grasping completion and grasping commencement? Beijing's approach is: before the freezing period, while vigorously grasping the construction of existing key projects, use more effort to launch a sudden start of new projects. On the premise of ensuring the completion of key projects, some minor finishing projects that do not affect production can temporarily give way to the commencement of new projects in terms of manpower and other aspects when there are conflicts. After freezing, more effort will be used to focus on finishing projects; for newly started projects, important ones will be carried out in winter construction, and minor ones will be protected with simple frost-proof facilities, and construction will continue next spring. Of course, all newly started projects must be within the plan. At the same time, attention should be paid to implementing the spirit of concentrating forces to ensure key projects during the commencement process, and non-key projects should not be built too much to avoid inappropriately dispersing forces.

    To do a good job in the sudden start of new projects, we cannot rely solely on the strength of the construction departments. Design departments, construction departments, units undertaking equipment manufacturing tasks, and municipal engineering departments should, under centralized leadership, work together with the construction departments, with one heart and one mind, to fight together. When all departments are mobilized, working closely together, working hard and skillfully, problems in design, raw materials, equipment, and other aspects can be solved more quickly, preparing conditions for the commencement of more projects.

    The autumn is clear and refreshing, which is a good season for construction; the high enthusiasm of the broad masses of construction workers is a strong guarantee for doing a good job in large-scale completion and large-scale commencement. It is hoped that the capital construction departments in all regions, especially the northern provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, will further oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, launch large-scale mass movements, and strive to start a large number of projects with available conditions while ensuring that key projects are put into production as early as possible. In this way, we can better win time, gain the initiative, and ensure a continuous Great Leap Forward on the capital construction front!

　　大抓完工　大抓开工
　　本报评论员
    北京基本建设部门展开秋季大战，力争11月20日以前开工一百六十万平方米，竣工八十万平方米。这种在第四季度一手抓完工、一手抓开工的作法，是保证基本建设不断大跃进的战略性措施。
    力争打破月末高、月初低，年末高、年初低的“常规”，保证生产建设不断稳定地上升，是工业战线各个部门当前的一项共同的重要任务。但是，基本建设在广大地区受到自然条件的限制，而具有季节性。当冬季来临，天寒地冻的时候，北方各省就难以在户外施工。往年冬季，常常是北方的施工“淡季”，许多建筑工人只能参加冬训等活动，劳动力有较大的浪费；冬季闲了，到夏季、秋季又要抢工。今年各地基本建设部门缩短战线，大抓收尾工程以后，在增加工程完工数量、迅速发挥投资效果等方面收到了巨大的良好的效果。可是，在大批工程完工以后，如果不在第四季度抓紧多开工一批项目，明年第一季度的工作量就可能相对地减少。等到春暖解冻的时候再大量开工，既可能造成一段时间的窝工，又会影响一部分工程的进度。从目前到11月底，许多地区不冷不热，雨季已过，正是施工的黄金季节。在这个时候，抓紧多开工一批项目，情况就将更加有利。在南方，第四季度和明年第一季度的建设可以紧密衔接，不断高涨；更北方，上冻以后，接着大搞冬季施工，明春再来个春季攻势，那末，全国基本建设就可以一浪高过一浪，持续不断地向前发展。结果也就能更有力地保证工业生产连续大跃进。
    当前基本建设部门头等的任务是要大抓收尾工程，保证今年要完工的各项重要工程提早投入生产。抓完工、抓开工如何妥善安排，协调地前进呢？北京的作法是：在结冰以前，一面大抓现有重点工程的建设，一面用较多的力量突击开工。在保证重点工程完工的前提下，一部分次要的不影响生产的收尾工程在人力等方面与开工发生矛盾时，也可以暂时为开工让路。上冻以后，便用更多的力量突击收尾工程；新开工项目，重要的进行冬季施工，次要的用简易的防冻设施保护起来，等明春再继续施工。当然，一切新开工的项目必须是计划内的，同时在开工中需要注意贯彻集中力量保证重点的精神，不宜过多地兴建非重点项目，以免不适当地分散力量。
    要搞好突击开工，不能仅靠施工部门的力量。设计部门、建设部门、承担设备制造任务的单位以及市政工程部门，应该在集中领导下，与施工部门一起，同心协力，共同奋战。各部门都紧张动员起来，紧密协作，苦干巧干，可以更快地解决设计、原材料、设备等方面的问题，为更多的工程准备开工条件。
    秋高气爽，正是大好的施工季节；广大建筑工人气冲斗牛的高涨热情，是搞好大完工、大开工的有力保证。希望各地、特别是北方各省、市、自治区的基本建设部门，进一步反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，在保证重点工程提早投入生产的同时，力争条件具备的工程大量开工。这样，我们就可以更好地赢得时间，争得主动，确保基本建设战线持续不断地向前大跃进！
