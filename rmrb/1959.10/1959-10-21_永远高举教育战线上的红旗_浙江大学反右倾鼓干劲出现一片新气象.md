Always Hold High the Red Flag on the Education Front
Zhejiang University's Anti-Rightist Drive Spurs a New Atmosphere

(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th dispatch) After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 10,000 teachers, students, and staff of Zhejiang University have experienced an unprecedented surge in political enthusiasm. In order to resolutely implement the Party's educational policy and comprehensively improve the quality of teaching, a socialist competition upsurge of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" has been launched throughout the university, creating a new atmosphere of great leaps forward in teaching, labor production, and scientific research.

After rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, Zhejiang University implemented the Party's policy of combining education with labor production, carried out an in-depth educational revolution, and achieved tremendous achievements in teaching, labor production, and scientific research. All aspects saw great leaps forward, and the quality of education was significantly improved. However, in the past year, the implementation of the General Line and the Party's educational policy has also been hampered by some right-leaning conservative thinking. A few teachers doubted the Party's policy of combining education with labor production, believing that running factories in schools was "not worth the loss" and that "labor production would affect professional studies." Therefore, some teaching and research groups, when arranging teaching plans, one-sidedly emphasized the study of theoretical knowledge and allocated very little time to labor production; some one-sidedly emphasized that labor production must be combined with specialized fields and should not be general labor; some teachers opposed mass movements in schools, believing that mass movements in schools would disrupt the school's teaching order and violate the law of gradual progress; some teachers believed that to improve the quality of teaching, one must teach more and learn more, and therefore adopted a cramming teaching method. This right-leaning conservative thinking has affected the implementation of the Party's educational policy and the improvement of teaching quality. After the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Committee of Zhejiang University determined that the task for the new semester would be to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, encourage vigor, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, and comprehensively improve the quality of teaching," and launched a study movement of the Eighth Plenary Session throughout the university. The vast number of teachers, students, and staff, armed with the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, combined them with their own ideological realities, launched discussions and informal talks, unified their thinking, recognized the situation, clarified certain confused ideas, and further boosted their revolutionary vigor.

In the past two months, heart-stirring examples have emerged everywhere at Zhejiang University. On the basis of raising awareness, teachers and students throughout the university have revised their red and expert plans for teaching and research groups, classes, and individuals, and have adhered to putting politics in command. Many members of the Communist Youth League in Class 572 of the Electrical Engineering Department's Industrial Enterprise Electrification major have proposed to actively create conditions to strive to join the Party, while non-League students have requested to join the League. Students in Class 561 of the Engineering Physics major worked hard, practically, and cleverly in the newly built Electronic Instrument Factory in Shanghai, achieving a double harvest of being both red and expert, and were warmly praised by the factory. Students in Class 561 of the Silicate Engineering major of the Chemical Engineering Department, due to the improvement of the political consciousness of all students in the class, have formed a new situation of universally seizing the time to study hard. Although the study tasks are relatively heavy this semester, they generally complete their homework very well, and some students even take time to minor in German or audit courses. Fifth-year students in the Fuel Chemical Engineering and Chemical Production Machines and Equipment majors of the Chemical Engineering Department have all translated Russian books in combination with their majors. Learning has greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the teachers, who have proposed to "adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen unity; establish red flags in teaching, and be models in scientific research." They immediately took action and started working. Senior teachers led new teachers in the establishment and expansion of laboratories; in scientific research, they strived to have the appraisal test and production of two types of cyclone furnaces, and also began the manufacturing of fluidized bed furnaces. Many teachers in teaching and research groups said that they would respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party with practical actions to improve teaching. Each department used the Party's educational policy to measure its own teaching plan, and found that the labor time arranged in the past was insufficient, so they immediately made revisions. Many teaching and research groups in the Department of Mechanical Engineering increased the originally scheduled eight weeks of labor time to ten weeks, and also formed a special group to study how to organize labor production so that it could play a more effective role. The teachers of the Metallography and Heat Treatment Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Metallurgy were full of energy under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session. Although the teaching tasks are very heavy this semester: the four teachers in the group have to teach eight large classes, one of which is a new course, each teacher tries his best to overcome difficulties and still ensures that there is one unit of time each week for discussion. In the process of compiling lecture notes, in order to ensure quality, everyone carefully discussed the outline, divided up the responsibilities for writing the initial draft, and then conducted collective discussions and multiple revisions, striving for correctness and system.

The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session inspired the revolutionary vigor of teachers, students, and staff, and the offices, factories, and laboratories were filled with people fighting day and night. In just over ten days, all the teachers, students, and staff of the Electrical Engineering Department and the Radio Engineering Department completed the manufacture and installation of 21 new experimental equipment, and completed eight scientific research projects with complex equipment and good quality.

At present, the Party Committee of Zhejiang University is fully mobilizing the masses to further study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, in order to strive for a comprehensive leap forward in teaching work.

    永远高举教育战线上的红旗
    浙江大学反右倾鼓干劲出现一片新气象
    本报杭州20日电　浙江大学一万多个师生员工学习了党的八届八中全会文件后，政治热情空前高涨。为了坚决贯彻党的教育方针，全面提高教学质量，在全校范围内已掀起了“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的社会主义竞赛热潮。出现了教学、劳动生产、科学研究三跃进的新气象。
    浙江大学通过整风、反右斗争后，贯彻了党的教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，进行了深入的教育革命，在教学、劳动生产、科学研究方面都取得了巨大的成就，各方面出现了大跃进，教育质量有了显著的提高。但是一年来在贯彻执行总路线和党的教育方针上，也受到一些右倾保守思想的阻碍，有少数教师对党的教育和劳动生产相结合的方针有怀疑，他们认为学校办工厂是“得不偿失”、“劳动生产会影响业务学习”。因此，有的教研组在安排教学计划时，片面强调理论知识学习，把劳动生产的时间安排得很少；有的片面强调劳动生产必须结合专业，不要一般性的劳动；有的教师反对在学校里搞群众运动，认为在学校里搞群众运动会把学校教学秩序打乱、违反循序渐进的规律；有些教师认为要提高教学质量，就必须教得多、学得多，因而采取填鸭式的教学方法。这种右倾保守思想影响了党的教育方针的贯彻，影响了教学质量的提高。从党的八届八中全会文件公布后，浙江大学党委会就确定了以“反右倾、鼓干劲、坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针、全面提高教学质量”为新学期的任务，在全校范围内开展了学习八届八中全会的学习运动。广大师生员工，以党的八中全会文件为武器，联系思想实际，展开讨论、漫谈，统一思想、认清形势、澄清了某些糊涂观念，进一步鼓足革命干劲。
    两个月来，浙江大学到处出现动人心弦的事例。全校师生在提高认识的基础上，重新修订了教研组、班级和个人红专规划，坚持政治挂帅。电机系工业企业电气化专业572班许多共青团员，都提出要积极创造条件，争取入党，非团同学则纷纷要求入团。工程物理专业561班同学，在上海新建电子仪器厂劳动，苦干、实干、巧干，获得红专两丰收，受到工厂热烈表扬。化工系硅酸盐工学专业561班同学，由于全班同学政治觉悟提高，在班内形成了一个普遍抓紧时间努力学习的新局面。虽然这学期学习任务比较重，但一般还是很好地完成作业，有的同学还抽出时间去选修德语或旁听。化工系燃料化学工学和化学生产机器及装备专业五年级的同学们都结合专业翻译俄文书籍。学习大大鼓足教师们的干劲，提出了“坚持政治挂帅，加强团结；教学树红旗，科研当标兵”。说干就干，立即上马，老教师带领新教师进行实验室的建立和扩建；科研上争取有两种旋风炉的鉴定试验和生产，沸腾炉的制造也着手进行。很多教研组的教师表示要以搞好教学的实际行动来响应党的八中全会的号召。各系都以党的教育方针来衡量自己的教学计划，发现过去安排的劳动时间不够，立刻进行了修改。机械系很多教研组把原订八周的劳动时间增加到十周，并且组成专人小组，研究如何组织劳动生产，使它更有效地发挥作用。冶金系金相热处理教研组教师们，在八中全会精神鼓舞下，干劲十足。本学期虽然教学任务很重：全组四个教师，要开出八个大班的课，其中有一门还是新课，但每个教师都千方百计克服困难，仍然保证了每周有一个单位时间进行讨论。在编写讲义过程中，为了保证质量，大家认真地讨论了大纲，分工负责编写初稿，再经集体讨论、多次修改，力求正确和系统。
    八中全会的决议鼓舞着师生员工的革命干劲，办公室、工厂、实验室，到处是日夜奋战的人群。电机系、无线电系的全体师生员工们，在短短的十多天中，完成了自己制造、安装的二十一个新实验设备，完成了八项设备复杂、质量较好的科学研究项目。
    目前，浙江大学党委正在充分发动群众，进一步深入学习八中全会文件，以争取教学工作上的全面跃进。
