Xinhua News Agency, 17th October. The spokesperson of the Red Cross Society of China headquarters today made a statement to Chinese and foreign journalists, strongly condemning the Japanese Red Cross Society for obstructing the return of pro-North Korean residents in Japan.

The spokesperson said at the press conference:

"After the Red Cross Societies of North Korea and Japan signed an agreement on August 13 regarding the return of pro-North Korean residents in Japan, the Red Cross Society of China and the Red Cross Societies of all countries that advocate humanitarianism and justice expected the Japanese Red Cross Society to send pro-North Korean residents back to their country as soon as possible in accordance with this agreement. However, the ink on the agreement was barely dry when the Japanese Red Cross Society succumbed to reactionary political goals, created unnecessary obstacles, and openly began to undermine the agreement. In the 'Guidelines for Returning Home' it issued on September 3, it stipulated a series of clauses that violated the agreement, such as 'confirming' the 'free will' of pro-North Korean residents who apply to return home, prohibiting pro-North Korean residents from having any contact with the outside world during their return journey; setting up a 'secret room' in Niigata Port, the place of embarkation, to 'confirm' their 'intentions'; and prohibiting them from taking the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, etc. The Japanese Red Cross Society also stipulated extremely unreasonable deadlines for pro-North Korean residents to apply for return. The Japanese authorities even instructed the police to fabricate excuses to illegally arrest pro-North Korean residents in Niigata who hoped to return home, attempting to create a sense of terror among the pro-North Korean residents. This inhuman act by the Japanese Red Cross Society and the Japanese authorities to obstruct the return of pro-North Korean residents has aroused great anger among the Korean people and the people of the world who uphold justice."

The spokesperson said: "When Red Cross Societies of various countries assist overseas residents to return to their country, they must respect the personality and free will of the overseas residents. The Japanese Red Cross Society has stipulated various clauses in an attempt to force pro-North Korean residents to change their will to return home, and treats them like prisoners, insults their personality, and tramples on their basic human rights. This is a complete violation of the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, and it is a great disgrace to the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross."

The spokesperson pointed out: "It is very clear that this perfidious act of the Japanese Red Cross Society to undermine the agreement is a reflection of the Japanese authorities succumbing to the 'Cold War' policy of the American occupiers; the issue of the repatriation of pro-North Korean residents is being used by the Kishi Nobusuke government as a bargaining chip in political negotiations with the Syngman Rhee clique. We must solemnly point out that it is absolutely unacceptable for the Japanese Red Cross Society to subordinate this humanitarian work of assisting overseas residents to return to their country to reactionary political goals, and to violate the agreement signed by the Red Cross Societies of North Korea and Japan and the basic principles of the Red Cross."

The spokesperson said: "Currently, due to the illegal obstruction by the Japanese authorities and the Japanese Red Cross Society, the vast number of pro-North Korean residents in Japan, who have already sold their family property and daily necessities and are ready to go, are in a miserable situation of having no place to live and no means of livelihood because they cannot realize their wish to return home as soon as possible. The Red Cross Society of China expresses its deep concern for them and has decided to donate 100,000 yuan RMB for relief." The spokesperson finally emphasized: "Based on humanitarian principles, the Red Cross Society of China demands that the Japanese Red Cross Society immediately stop all acts that obstruct the return of pro-North Korean residents in Japan, quickly implement the agreement, and assist them to return home as soon as possible."

### 我国红十字会发表声明  谴责日本阻挠旅日朝侨回国

　　我国红十字会发表声明
    谴责日本阻挠旅日朝侨回国
    新华社17日讯　中国红十字会总会发言人今天下午向中外记者发表声明，严正谴责日本红十字会阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民归国的行为。
    发言人在记者招待会上说：
    “朝日两国红十字会于8月13日签订关于旅日朝侨回国的协议后，中国红十字会和一切主张人道和正义的各国红十字会都期待日本红十字会能够根据这项协议早日遣送旅日朝侨回国。然而，协议墨迹未干，日本红十字会便屈从于反动的政治目的，节外生枝，公然开始破坏协议。它在9月3日发表的‘回国指南’中规定一系列违反协议的条款，如‘确认’申请回国的朝侨的‘自由意志’，禁止朝侨在回国途中同外界进行一切联系；在登船的地方新澙港设立‘秘密室’，
  ‘确认’他们的‘意愿’；禁止他们拿朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗等。日本红十字会还为朝侨规定极不合理的申请回国期限。日本当局甚至还指使警察制造借口在新澙非法逮捕希望回国的朝侨，企图在朝侨中间造成一种恐怖心理。日本红十字会和日本当局的这种阻挠朝侨回国的违反人道行为已经引起朝鲜人民和全世界主持正义的人民的极大愤怒。”
    发言人说：“各国红十字会在协助侨民归国时都必须尊重侨民的人格和他们的自由意志，日本红十字会竟然规定种种条款，企图强迫朝侨改变他们的归国意志，并且把他们视如囚犯，侮辱他们的人格，蹂躏他们的基本人权，这是完全违反红十字的人道原则的，也是红十字人道原则的一个极大的耻辱”。
    发言人指出：“事情十分明显，日本红十字会这种破坏协议的背信弃义行为是日本当局屈从于美国占领者的‘冷战’政策的反映；朝侨遣返问题正被岸信介政府利用来作为同李承晚集团在政治上讨价还价的资本。我们必须严正指出，日本红十字会把协助侨民归国的这一人道工作屈从于反动的政治目的，而违反朝、日两国红十字会所签订的协议和红十字的基本原则，是绝对不能容许的。”
    发言人说：“目前，由于日本当局和日本红十字会的非法阻挠，广大旅日朝侨，在已经变卖了家产和日常生活用具，整装待发的情况下，由于无法实现他们早日回国的愿望，已陷于没有住处、生活无着的悲惨境地。中国红十字会对他们表示深切关怀，并决定捐款人民币十万元予以救济。”发言人最后强调说：“中国红十字会基于人道主义立场，要求日本红十字会立即停止一切阻挠旅日朝侨回国的行为，迅速实行协议，早日协助他们回国。”
