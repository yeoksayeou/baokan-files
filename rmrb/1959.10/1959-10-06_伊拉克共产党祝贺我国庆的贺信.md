Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Central Committee of the CPC received a congratulatory letter from Salam Adel, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party, on the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,

Dear Comrades!

The great historical victory of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in establishing a people's democratic regime on the basis of crushing the feudal and imperialist system, has encouraged the struggle of the Chinese working class and all the people to move towards victory, and has forever liberated a quarter of mankind from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and reactionary rule, and has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the 600 million people to develop their economy and culture and eliminate exploitation and enslavement.

The victory of the great Chinese revolution is a victory for the Asian people, a victory for progressive mankind, and also a victory for the cause of peace, liberation, and socialism in the world.

The founding of the People's Republic of China has changed the balance of international forces and strengthened the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The significant achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in consolidating the people's democratic system and in socialist construction in the past ten years have once again proved the vitality of Marxism-Leninism by transforming China from a backward country into a country with rapid development in industry, agriculture, and culture.

We Iraqi Communists deeply know the great significance of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries to our two countries. All our compatriots greatly appreciate the genuine brotherly assistance that the heroic Republic of Iraq has received from the People's China.

We hope that the cooperative relations between our two countries will be further strengthened on the basis of peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit, for the sake of world peace and the liberation of the peoples of all countries.

Finally, we hope - dear comrades - to accept our heartfelt congratulations to you, to your great party, and to the great people, and we wish your country continuous success and prosperity.

Long live the glorious 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

May the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, achieve victory for the great cause of socialism and communism!

May the friendship between Iraq and China continue to strengthen!

Secretary of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party
Salam Adel (signed)

    伊拉克共产党祝贺我国庆的贺信
    新华社5日讯　中共中央收到伊拉克共产党中央委员会书记萨拉姆·阿德勒祝贺我国建国十周年的贺信。信的全文如下：致中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们！
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在粉碎封建的、帝国主义的制度的基础上建立了人民民主政权的伟大的历史性的胜利，鼓舞了中国工人阶级和全体人民的斗争走向胜利，永远地从帝国主义、封建主义和反动统治的枷锁中，解放了全人类四分之一的中国人民，并在六亿人民发展经济与文化、消灭剥削和奴役的道路上开辟了无限广阔的前景。
    伟大的中国革命的胜利是亚洲人民的胜利，是进步人类的胜利，同时也是世界上和平、解放、社会主义事业的胜利。
    中华人民共和国的成立改变了国际力量的对比，加强了以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营。中国人民在过去十年中，在中国共产党的领导下，在巩固人民民主制度、在社会主义建设方面的重大成就，使得中国已从一个落后的国家转变成为工业、农业、文化事业迅速发展着的国家，这就又一次地证明了马克思列宁主义的生命力。
    我们伊拉克共产党人深深知道我们两国之间的友谊和合作关系对我们两国的重大意义。我们全体同胞都很赞扬英勇的伊拉克共和国从人民中国所得到的真正的兄弟般的援助。
    我们希望我们两国间的合作关系将在和平共处和互利的基础上，为了世界和平和各国人民的解放，而得到更进一步的加强。
    最后我们希望——亲爱的同志们——接受我们对你们，对你们伟大的党、伟大的人民的衷心的祝贺，希望你们国家不断地取得成功和繁荣昌盛。
    中华人民共和国成立的光辉的十周年纪念万岁！
    祝中国人民在中国共产党的领导下为社会主义与共产主义的伟大的事业取得胜利！
    祝伊中友谊不断加强！
            伊拉克共产党中央委员会书记
                萨拉姆·阿德勒（签字）
