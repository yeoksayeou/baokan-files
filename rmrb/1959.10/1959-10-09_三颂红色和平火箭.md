Title: Three Odes to the Red Peace Rocket

Three times, and again, and again:—
The Red Peace Rocket soars to the sky once more!
This truly is a string of salutes, a thunderous roar,
Glad tidings instantly spread throughout the heavens and earth.

A matter of chance, yet not by chance—
It was on this very day, October 4th,
That we bid farewell to Comrade Khrushchev as he flew back to the Soviet Union,
Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Long live the great Sino-Soviet brotherly friendship!
Hooray, glory belongs to the great Soviet Union!

Think about it, take a look:
In a short span of just two years,
Space is no longer troubled by loneliness and despair,
The Soviet giant has caressed the celestial edge with its mighty hand several times.

Don't you see,
One satellite is still orbiting the Earth.
One rocket is still whirling within the solar system.
The second rocket just sent into the lunar palace.
And this third one, ah,
It will be circling around the moon.

Poet Qu Yuan of the Chu Kingdom!
From now on, you need not "Question Heaven" again.
Poet Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty!
You need not sigh about the "difficulty of the Shu Road,"
Nor fear "the difficulty of ascending to the blue sky."

From now on, there are doors to enter the earth,
And roads to ascend to heaven.
All the secrets of the universe will be laid before humankind.

Don't you see,
We are not satisfied with just reaching the front gate of the lunar palace,
We also want to tour its backyard.
To see why she is always so shy,
Constantly holding a pipa, half-veiling her face.

Chang'e, Wu Gang,
We invite you down to the mortal world three times.
Hoping you see clearly:
The East Wind rises above Tiananmen.
The lights of the square obscure the long sky.
Come and dance a celestial dance with us,
Then sing "The East is Red" together with us.

Comrades, dance, sing,
Sing so that world peace can last forever,
Sing so that warmongers tremble and turn back.
Sing so that the people of all countries unite and join hands.
Sing so that billions of men and women can quickly take a journey of ten thousand miles across the sky!

    三颂红色和平火箭
    萧三
    一而再，再而三：——
    红色和平火箭又上天！
    这真是连珠礼炮频射震天响，
    喜讯顿时传遍天上与人间。
    事属偶然非偶然——
    就在10月4日这一天，
    我们欢送赫鲁晓夫同志飞苏联，
    庆祝中苏友好协会成立十周年。
    万岁，伟大的中苏兄弟友谊！
    欢呼呵，光荣属于伟大的苏联！
    想一想，看一看：
    短短时间不过整二年，
    太空再也不愁寂寞奈何天，
    苏维埃巨人几次巨手抚天沿。
    君不见，
    一个卫星还在绕着地球转。
    一支火箭还在太阳系内作飞旋。
    第二支火箭刚刚送进月宫去。
    这第三支呵，
    它将围着月亮打圈圈。
    楚国诗人老屈原！
    你从今不必再“问天”。
    唐代诗人李太白！
    你一不必再叹“蜀道难”，
    二不必再怕“难于上青天”。
    从今入地有门，
    上天也有路。
    宇宙一切秘密将摆在人面前。
    君不见，
    吾人到了月宫前门还不算，
    还要进它的后院去游览。
    看她为何老是羞答答，
    常抱琵琶半遮面。
    嫦娥呵，吴刚呵，
    吾人三请你们下凡尘。
    希望你们看的真：
    天安门上生东风。
    广场灯火蔽长空。
    快来合跳个仙人舞，
    然后和我们齐唱东方红。
    同志们，舞吧，唱吧，
    唱得世界和平能持久，
    唱得战争狂人直发抖，猛回头。
    唱得各国人民大团结，手携手。
    唱得亿兆男女快作万里天际游！
