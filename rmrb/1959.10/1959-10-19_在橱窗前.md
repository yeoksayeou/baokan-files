　　In Front of the Shop Window
　　Qin Li
    During the National Day holiday, in addition to enjoying exquisite films and theatrical performances, people also enjoyed another kind of visual pleasure: the carefully designed shop window displays.
    When you stroll along Wangfujing Street, Xidan Street, or Qianmen Street, you are often attracted by the window displays, temporarily leaving the bustling crowd, pausing for a moment like appreciating a work of art.
    What you see is a scene from the Lotus Dance. Amidst the colorful lotus patterns, several young girls are dancing gracefully, wearing dazzling brocade silks. From these beautiful images, can't you see the new look of China's textile industry?
    In front of another shop window, you see a batch of newly published literary books presented as gifts. The bindings are exquisite, the cover designs are unique, and all kinds of beauty are displayed, marking a new peak in the publishing industry. It is not easy to make changes to the display of books, but look at how interestingly they are arranged. A small vase is also placed on the bookshelf, with beautiful peacock feathers inserted. This shop window is enough for you to look at for a quarter of an hour, and deeply fall in love with these books.
    As viewers of the shop windows, we should thank the hard work and meticulous efforts of these shop window display designers and arrangers. Their work has gone far beyond the scope of commercial work, and is actually carrying out another form of socialist propaganda and education.

　　在橱窗前
　　秦犁
    国庆假期，在欣赏了精美的影片和戏剧演出之余，还享受到另外一种眼福：这就是许多经过精心设计的橱窗布置。
    当你散步在王府井大街、西单大街或者前门大街上，你常会被橱窗的陈列吸引住，暂时离开熙熙攘攘的人群，像鉴赏一件艺术品似地小驻片刻。
    你看到的是荷花舞的场景，在五彩缤纷的荷花图案中，几个少女正翩翩起舞，在她们的身上，披着光彩夺目的绫罗绸缎。从这几个美妙的形象上，你不是可以看到我国纺织工业的新面貌么？
    在另一个橱窗前，你看到一批新出版的文学献礼书籍，装帧的精美，封面设计各有千秋，众妙俱陈，标志着出版事业的新的高峰。书籍的陈列是不容易有变化的，可是你瞧它们被安排得多么有意思，在书几上还放个小花瓶，插着美丽的孔雀毛。这面橱窗，就够你瞧上一刻钟，而且深深地爱上这些书。
    作为橱窗的观众，应该感谢这些橱窗陈列设计者和布置者的辛勤和细心的劳动，他们的工作，实在已经远远超出商业工作的范围，实际上是在进行另一种方式的社会主义宣传教育了。
