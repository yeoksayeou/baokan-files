Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The State Council recently issued instructions to various localities, deciding to increase the purchase prices of soybeans, peanuts, sugar cane, sugar beets, and draft cattle, and the sales prices of soybeans, soybean oil, peanuts, peanut oil, and beef; and to reduce the sales prices of penicillin and streptomycin.

　　The instruction stated that although the planting area and total output of soybeans and peanuts have increased year by year in recent years, they still cannot meet the needs of improved living standards. In order to further promote the development of production, it has been decided that the purchase price of soybeans will be increased by an average of 7.5% in eighteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country (Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou). The purchase price of peanuts will be increased by an average of 12.08% in thirteen provinces and cities across the country (Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan).

　　The principle for increasing the purchase prices of sugarcane, sugar beets, and draft cattle is: prices that were already relatively high will not be changed, and prices that were relatively low will be appropriately increased to bring the price levels of adjacent areas into alignment.

　　The instruction stated that after the purchase price of soybeans and peanuts is increased, in order to maintain a reasonable price difference between the sales price and the purchase price, it has been decided that the sales prices of soybeans, soybean oil, peanuts, and peanut oil will also be appropriately increased. The sales prices of soybean cake and peanut cake will remain at their original levels. In order to prevent the sales prices of soybean oil and peanut oil from being raised too high, and at the same time to ensure that operating departments and processing departments have appropriate profits, it has been decided to reduce the tax rate on soybean oil and peanut oil from the current 15% to 8%, and the tax rate on soybean oil and peanut oil that farmers extract and consume themselves will be reduced from the current 12.5% to 8%.

　　Among the eighteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions that are increasing the purchase price of soybeans, the sales price of soybean oil will be increased by an average of 9.37% in thirteen areas; the sales price of soybean oil in the remaining five regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Sichuan, and Guizhou will not be increased this time. In some areas, the sales volume of soybean oil is very small, and it is optional whether to increase the price or not. The decision on whether to increase the price will be made by the province itself. In the eighteen regions where the purchase price of soybeans is being increased, the sales price of soybeans will be increased by an average of 7.63%.

　　Among the thirteen regions that are increasing the purchase price of peanuts, the sales price of peanut oil will be increased by an average of 7.97% in the ten regions, excluding Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Jiangxi, where the sales price will not be increased.

　　The sales price of beef in areas where the purchase price of draft cattle is being increased will be appropriately arranged by various localities.

　　The instruction stated that the sales prices of medicines should continue to implement the central government's established policy of gradually reducing prices on the basis of production development. Penicillin and streptomycin, two drugs that previously relied mainly on imports and had relatively high sales prices, are now being produced in large quantities in our country and can be self-sufficient, making it possible to reduce sales prices. It has been decided to reduce the wholesale price of penicillin (200,000 units) from the current 65 cents per bottle to 45 cents; the wholesale price of streptomycin (1 million units) will be reduced from the current 1 yuan and 70 cents per bottle to 1 yuan and 10 cents.

　　The sales prices of penicillin and streptomycin were reduced on October 1st. The adjustment of purchase and sales prices of other commodities will be implemented starting on October 10th.

　　调整价格  促进生产
　　国务院决定提高大豆、花生、甘蔗、甜菜、菜牛的收购价格和大豆、豆油、花生、花生油、牛肉的销售价格；降低青霉素和链霉素的销售价格
    新华社15日讯　国务院最近向各地发出指示，决定提高大豆、花生、甘蔗、甜菜、菜牛的收购价格和大豆、豆油、花生、花生油、牛肉的销售价格，降低青霉素和链霉素的销售价格。
    指示说，几年来大豆、花生的种植面积和总产量，虽然逐年增加，但是还不能满足人民生活提高的需要。为了进一步促进生产的发展，决定全国十八个省、市、自治区（北京、上海、河北、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、山东、江苏、安徽、河南、湖北、四川、贵州）的大豆收购价格平均提高7.5％。全国十三个省、市（北京、上海、河北、辽宁、吉林、陕西、山东、江苏、安徽、河南、湖北、江西、四川）的花生收购价格平均提高12.08％。
    甘蔗、甜菜、菜牛收购价格提高的原则是：原来价格比较高的不再变动，原来价格比较低的适当提高一些，使相邻地区的价格水平衔接起来。
    指示说，在大豆、花生收购价格提高以后，为了使销售价格同收购价格之间保持合理的差价，决定大豆、豆油、花生、花生油的销售价格也要适当提高。豆饼、花生饼的销售价格则保持原有水平不动。为了使豆油、花生油的销售价格不致提得过高，同时使经营部门和加工部门又有适当的利润，豆油和花生油的税率决定由目前的15％降低为8％，农民自榨自食的豆油和花生油的税率由目前的12.5％降低为8％。
    在提高大豆收购价格的十八个省、市、自治区中，有十三个地区的豆油销售价格平均提高9.37％；其余陕西、甘肃、宁夏、四川、贵州五个地区豆油的销售价格，这次不再提价。有的地区，豆油的销售数量很少，销价可提可不提，是否提价由省里自行安排。在提高大豆收购价格的十八个地区，大豆销售价格平均提高7.63％。
    在提高花生收购价格的十三个地区中，除了辽宁、陕西、江西三个地区不再提高销价外，其余十个地区花生油的销售价格平均提高7.97％。
    提高菜牛收购价格的地区，牛肉的销售价格由各地适当安排。
    指示说，药品的销售价格，应当继续贯彻执行中央确定的在生产发展的基础上逐步降低价格的方针。青霉素和链霉素这两种药品过去主要依靠进口，销售价格比较高，现在我国已经大量生产，能够自给，有条件降低销售价格。决定青霉素（20万单位）的批发价格，由现在每瓶六角五分，降低为四角五分；链霉素（100万单位）的批发价格，由现在每瓶一元七角，降低为一元一角。
    青霉素和链霉素已在10月1日降低了销售价格，其他商品购、销价格的调整，决定自10月10日开始执行。
