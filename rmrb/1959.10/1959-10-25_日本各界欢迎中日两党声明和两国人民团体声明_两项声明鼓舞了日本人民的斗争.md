Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 24th: Leading figures from various circles in Japan published statements in "Akahata" today, expressing their warm welcome for the joint statement of the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties and the joint statement of the Chinese seven organizations and the Japanese delegation.
    Secretary of the Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma pointed out that these two statements and the communique issued by Premier Zhou and Mr. Ishibashi show that the Japanese people's desire to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and normalize relations between the two countries has developed into a tremendous force. Asanuma said that the Socialist Party will fight to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and achieve Japan's neutrality.
    Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the two statements encouraged the struggle of the Japanese people and played a beneficial role in the movement to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, which is about to reach its climax.
    Yuki Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out that the two statements clarified the common problems facing Japan and China. Yasui emphasized that it is necessary to make the spirit of the statement penetrate the hearts of the people.
    Kozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," pointed out that Japan's security can only be guaranteed by neutrality, and that the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, like preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," is a major prerequisite for Japan's neutralization. He said that at present we must further unite the strength of the Japanese people, crush the policy of hostility towards China and the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty," and promote the path of neutrality.
    Kumaichi Yamamoto, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, expressed his heartfelt welcome to these two statements. He said that peace and friendship are the basis for opening up trade between Japan and China. Without making efforts to strive for peace and friendship between Japan and China, it is impossible to restore Japan-China trade.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 23rd: More social organizations and trade unions in Japan have expressed their support for the joint statement of the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese Communist Party and the joint statement of the Chinese seven organizations and the Japanese delegation.
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, emphasized in "Akahata" today that these two joint statements have great significance. He said that we should launch a nationwide movement to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the revival of Japanese militarism, and strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, in accordance with these two statements.
    The National Movement Implementation Committee for Realizing the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between Japan and China and Celebrating the National Day of the People's Republic of China, composed of seventy organizations, expressed its welcome to the joint statement of the people's organizations of the two countries at a representative meeting held today. The meeting also decided to call on each member organization to pass resolutions supporting this statement.
    The meeting also decided that after the delegation returns to the country, it will hold conferences across the country where the delegates will present reports on their visit to China.
    Earlier, the Implementation Committee issued appeals to the governors, mayors, and heads of local assemblies of each prefecture, calling on them to strive to have the assemblies pass resolutions requesting that the current stalemate in Japan-China relations be broken, diplomatic relations between Japan and China be restored, and the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" be opposed.
    The Japan Calligraphy League, representing 40,000 calligraphers, also expressed its full support for the statement of the people's organizations of the two countries last night.

    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本各界领袖今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，表示热烈欢迎中日两国共产党的联合声明和中国七团体同日本各界代表团的共同声明。
    社会党书记浅沼稻次郎指出，这两个声明和周总理同石桥发表的会谈公报表明，日本人民要求恢复日中邦交和两国关系正常化的愿望已经发展成为巨大的力量。浅沼表示，社会党将为阻止修改日美“安全条约”、争取恢复日中邦交和日本的中立而斗争。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏说，两项声明对日本人民的斗争给予了鼓舞，并且对即将达到高潮的阻止修改日美“安全条约”和争取恢复日中邦交运动起了有益的作用。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁指出，两项声明阐明了日中两国所面临的共同问题。安井郁强调指出，有必要使声明的精神深入人民的心目中。
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三指出，日本的安全只有依靠中立才能保障，而且恢复日中邦交同阻止修改“安全条约”一样，是日本中立化的大前提。他说，目前我们必须进一步团结日本人民的力量，粉碎敌视中国的政策和修改“安全条约”的阴谋，促使走中立的路线。
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一表示衷心欢迎这两项声明。他说，和平与友好是打开日中贸易的基础。不做好争取日中两国间的和平与友好的努力，是无法恢复日中贸易的。

    由七十个团体组成的实现恢复日中邦交和庆祝中华人民共和国国庆国民运动实行委员会在今天召开的代表会议上表示欢迎两国人民团体的共同声明。会议还决定号召每个会员团体通过支持这个声明的决议。
    会议还决定，代表团回国后要在全国各地举行大会，由代表们作访问中国的报告。
    早些时候，实行委员会向各县的知事、市长和地方议会议长发出呼吁书，呼吁他们努力使议会通过决议，要求打破目前在日中关系上的僵局，恢复日中邦交和反对修改日美“安全条约”。
