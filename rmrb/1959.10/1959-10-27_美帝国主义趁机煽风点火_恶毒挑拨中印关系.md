Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: While manipulating the United Nations to illegally pass a despicable resolution smearing China on the so-called "Tibetan issue," U.S. imperialism continues to exploit the Sino-Indian border issue to provoke Sino-Indian relations, using the lie of the so-called "Chinese threat" to intimidate India and Southeast Asian countries. After the incident on October 20th and 21st, in which Indian armed personnel invaded the area south of Kongka Pass in the northwest of China's Tibet region, they have intensified this instigation.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Seoul, U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon, who came to the Far East to engage in conspiracies to create tension, actually expressed "deep regret" at a press conference in Seoul on the 24th regarding China's forced self-defense and counterattack against Indian invading armed personnel, and threatened that the United States was "prepared to abide by its promise to take action when the communists violate the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization area."

The "New York Times," which often reflects the official U.S. opinion, said in an editorial on the 24th that China's stern protest against the Indian armed invasion was "Beijing insulting India after hurting it." The "New York Times" made no secret of the United States' sinister intention to exploit the Sino-Indian border dispute, saying, "The dispute between India and Communist China has at least one good result, that is, it has enabled India and Pakistan to reconcile. They have resolved their eastern border disputes in the face of a common threat." It once again advocated that India and Pakistan should "unite to defend together."

Some U.S. officials and newspapers have been provoking Sino-Indian relations and inciting India to oppose China on the Sino-Indian border issue. U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy, on October 7th in Manila, nonsensically said that Asia's "common denominator" was "aggression" from China.

The provocations and intimidation of U.S. imperialism are intended to induce India to change its foreign policy, abandon neutralism, and ultimately drag India into its tool of aggression—the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The "New York Times" editorial on the 14th revealed this dirty attempt, saying that the Indian government's attitude toward China "if there is a truly profound change, it will have a broad impact. That would strengthen the confidence of those who are determined to resist and weaken the insidious voices of neutralism and defeatism."

After the Kongka Pass incident, some British newspapers also took the opportunity to slander China. The British "Observer" took the opportunity on the 25th to provoke, saying, "The Indian government may be forced to sever diplomatic relations with China."

### 美帝国主义趁机煽风点火  恶毒挑拨中印关系

    美帝国主义趁机煽风点火
    恶毒挑拨中印关系
    据新华社26日讯　美帝国主义在操纵联合国就所谓“西藏问题”非法通过污蔑中国的可耻决议的同时，继续利用中印边境问题挑拨中印关系，用所谓“中国的威胁”的谎言来恫吓印度和东南亚国家。在10月20日、21日印度武装人员侵入中国西藏地方西北端空喀山口以南领土事件发生后，它们就变本加厉地进行这种煽动。
    据合众国际社汉城消息，到远东来从事制造紧张局势阴谋的美国副国务卿狄龙，24日在汉城举行的记者招待会上竟对中国被迫自卫还击印度入侵武装人员一事表示“非常遗憾”，并且扬言美国“准备遵守它说要在共产党侵犯东南亚条约组织地区的时候采取行动的诺言”。
    经常反映美国官方意见的“纽约时报”在24日的社论中，把中国对印度武装入侵事件的严正抗议说成是“北京在伤害了印度之后还侮辱它。”“纽约时报”毫不掩饰美国要利用中印边境纠纷事件的阴险打算，它说，“印度和中国共产党的纠纷至少有一个好结果，那就是使印度和巴基斯坦重新修好。它们在面对共同威胁的情况下解决了它们东部边界纠纷。”它再次鼓吹印巴“团结起来共同防御”。
    美国一些官方人士和报纸在中印边界问题上一直在挑拨中印关系，煽动印度反对中国。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊10月7日在马尼拉曾胡说什么亚洲的“公分母”是来自中国的“侵略”。
    美帝国主义的挑衅和恫吓是为了诱使印度改变外交政策，放弃中立主义，最后把印度拉入它的侵略工具——东南亚条约组织中去。“纽约时报”14日的社论曾道出了它这种肮脏的企图，它说，印度政府对中国的态度“如果有一个真正深刻的转变，将会发生广泛的影响。那会加强那些有决心抵抗的人的信心，削弱中立主义和失败主义的阴险声音。”
    空喀山口的事件发生后有些英国报刊也趁机诬蔑中国。英国“观察家”周刊25日趁机挑拨说，“印度政府可以被迫同中国断绝外交关系。”
