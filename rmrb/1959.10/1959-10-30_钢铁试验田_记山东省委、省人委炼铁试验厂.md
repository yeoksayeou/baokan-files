Steel Experimental Field
——A Record of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee Steelmaking Experimental Factory

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee Steelmaking Experimental Factory was established by the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee during the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year to guide the work. It is a product of the Great Leap Forward. In the beginning, the vast majority of workers were staff from government organizations, and from cadres to workers, they were all people who had never seen steelmaking. However, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, they overcame all difficulties and broke through numerous obstacles, building small blast furnaces with hands that used to hold pens, and producing iron. The leaders of the province and city showed great concern for them, frequently visiting the factory to understand the situation and guide the work. In the most difficult times, they always pointed the way for them and gave them support. They were praised and rewarded for any small achievement in their work. This factory was born and grew under such care from the leadership. It now has two 3-cubic-meter and two 13-cubic-meter small blast furnaces, as well as three auxiliary workshops for cement, casting, and machine repair.

Small Blast Furnaces Can Achieve High Yield and Quality

From the beginning of furnace construction, the leadership instructed them "to set an example and do everything possible to make the small blast furnaces produce more iron and better iron." This was a significant and glorious responsibility, and they always regarded it as the overall requirement for all their activities.

They needed to build a furnace, but there were no construction workers. What to do? They did it themselves. Although everyone was inexperienced, they paid great attention to quality and worked very meticulously. They understood: "Good chickens lay good eggs; only a good furnace can produce more iron and better iron." They adopted the method of learning while building, step by step, and whenever they encountered difficulties, they would discuss them together or go out to learn, never acting rashly. They cherished every firebrick as if it were their own eyes, doing everything possible to prevent it from breaking or getting damp. Every firebrick was measured before being laid, and if it did not meet the specifications, it was immediately repaired, thereby creating the conditions for high yield and quality.

"Having a good horse, you must also know how to ride it." At the beginning of production, the first problems they encountered were low output and frequent accidents. How to ensure normal production and produce more iron? This really troubled them. To solve this problem, everyone was so anxious that they couldn't sleep or eat, pacing around the furnace, trying to find a solution. The workshop director, Yu Shuxiang, and the furnace chiefs, Gan Xinsheng and Yu Zhizeng, didn't leave the furnace to sleep in the dormitory for more than two months. They said: "Making the furnace produce iron is harder than subduing a tiger." But they did not lose confidence. They started by studying the specific accidents in production to accumulate experience. When they discovered "hanging charges," they worked with the masses and hired technicians from brother factories to implement a "joint consultation of native and foreign doctors." They consistently adopted the principle of "prevention is better than cure" when dealing with accidents. The furnace had a dedicated person in charge, checking the furnace condition every fifteen minutes. Once an accident occurred, they would analyze the cause and learn from the experience. At the same time, they also constantly held anti-accident drills to raise vigilance and enrich production experience. The small blast furnaces were finally tamed one by one. The daily output of the 13-cubic-meter small blast furnaces increased from about 13 tons to about 18 tons, with the "Leap Forward" blast furnace reaching a maximum daily output of 29 tons, and a utilization coefficient of over 2. The iron produced was lined up in rows. As they sang:

　　The azalea only blooms red in March, the pomegranate only in May.

　　Only the iron flower blooms unfading, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter.

Steelmaking requires both high yield and high quality. High yield is easier to achieve, but achieving high quality requires even greater effort. The main obstacle to achieving high quality was sulfur—the great enemy of steel—causing trouble. In February of this year, the higher authorities called for a vigorous attack on high sulfur to produce good iron. Because they were the experimental factory of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, they should naturally take the lead and actively respond. Therefore, the factory's leading cadres first explained to all employees the political and economic significance of producing more good iron, and then specifically explained what sulfur is, the harm of sulfur, and how to desulfurize. Then, they discussed solutions with the masses, and the conclusion was that desulfurization must take comprehensive measures. Therefore, they set up barriers everywhere, desulfurizing at every stage, tackling it both inside and outside the furnace. They even composed a desulfurization song, singing it while making steel:

　　Roast the ore to death,

　　Raise the furnace temperature to scald you to death,

　　Mix in lime to stir you to death,

　　Sprinkle lime to subdue you,

　　Set up desulfurization barriers at every step,

　　Only if you kowtow and obey will we spare you.

After four days and nights of effort, they finally subdued the high sulfur. The sulfur content of the iron dropped from 0.257 to below 0.05, and the qualification rate reached over 90%.

Whether or not high yield and high quality can be achieved largely depends on the quality of raw material preparation, just as a person's body is unhealthy if they lack nutrition. Therefore, they always pay attention to strengthening the management of raw materials. After the raw materials enter the factory, they are stored separately according to the mining area and registered according to the date of entry. After testing, they are processed and put into the furnace. They adhere to the "four no-nos for the furnace": unqualified materials are not allowed to enter the furnace, wet materials are not allowed to enter the furnace, unclean materials are not allowed to enter the furnace, and materials with unknown components are not allowed to enter the furnace. Facts have proved that success depends on human effort. As long as you have great enthusiasm, operate well, are not afraid of difficulties, and study diligently, small blast furnaces can also achieve high yield and quality.

Through production practice and technical theory study, they gradually grasped the production rules of small blast furnaces: in terms of raw materials, small blast furnaces must eat fine, eat well, eat cooked, and eat hot; in terms of operation, they must achieve "three diligences, one strength, one high, and two stabilities," that is, diligent observation, diligent analysis and research, diligent contact and cooperation, strong wind, high temperature, stable wind temperature, and stable air volume. In order to consolidate and develop high yield and high quality, they gathered this experience from the masses, formed a system, strengthened technical management, and formulated and unified operating procedures.

Small Blast Furnaces Can Also Be Profitable

The problem of high yield and high quality was gradually solved, and then the higher authorities instructed them to implement economic accounting. The problem arose again. Some people said, "What we are doing is a money-losing business, how can we not lose money?" Some people wanted to sabotage and break up the group, saying, "Do we have to do this money-losing business? Let's quit!" Some comrades who came from government organizations wanted to return to their original units. These ideological activities, from a small perspective, reflected a lack of confidence in small blast furnace steelmaking not losing money; from a large perspective, it was a doubt about the two-legged walking policy. This was a matter of the factory's future and destiny. The factory's Party committee studied this issue and believed that the policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously was the Party's policy and must be resolutely implemented. Since they could produce iron, they could certainly not lose money. Therefore, they first calculated the political benefits of reducing costs to the masses, then revealed the economic bottom line, and then worked with the masses to study ways to reduce costs. After discussion by the masses, the fundamental solution was high quality and high yield. In May, they produced 400 tons more of good iron, which played a decisive role in reducing costs. But doing only this was not enough. Everyone also launched technical innovations and rationalization proposals around the center of how to reduce costs. For example, improving the roasting method can save a lot of fuel throughout the year; using gas to burn boilers can save more than 180 tons of coal a year. At the same time, many measures were taken to greatly reduce the loss of raw materials.

Through this series of measures, significant progress was made in reducing costs. The masses said, "In the past, we only knew how to feed the furnace and produce iron, and we would take whatever we lacked and throw away whatever was broken. How could we not lose money doing this?" Everyone had an urgent desire to reduce costs and was full of confidence. On this basis, an economic accounting system was established to strengthen cost management. Due to the above measures, the factory first turned from loss to profit in May of this year, submitting more than 4,000 yuan in profits. Facts have proved that it is not predetermined that small blast furnaces will lose money. As long as the leadership is determined, boldly mobilizes the masses, and takes active actions, it can not only avoid losing money but also make a profit.

A True Experimental Factory

Since its establishment more than a year ago, this steelmaking experimental factory has taken the lead in everything, actively responding to all the Party's calls and instructions, and setting an example first. Therefore, provincial and municipal leading organs often hold on-site meetings at this factory. Since the beginning of this year, 112 units with more than 1,200 people have visited the factory. They have also trained more than 500 furnace operators for brother factories. When the furnaces of brother factories broke down, they actively sent people to help solve the problems, no matter day or night, wind or rain, they were always available when called upon.

In terms of materials, as long as they had them, they would actively support brother factories. Some time ago, they heard that an alcohol factory lacked a blower, so they gave one to them; they heard that the No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory lacked a motor, so they also gave one to them. Although they needed these things themselves, in order to build socialism, they fully demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation.

They also clearly realized that if they wanted to truly play the role of an experimental factory, they must also humbly and sincerely learn from brother factories, take the strengths of others to make up for their own shortcomings, and constantly advance and improve. Since this year alone, they have sent people out to study 29 times, learning about pulverized coal machines, automatic ore powder sieving, self-fluxing sintering methods, gas roasting, and so on.

    钢铁试验田
    ——记山东省委、省人委炼铁试验厂
    中共山东省委、省人民委员会炼铁试验厂是去年全民大办钢铁期间，省委和省人委为了指导工作而举办的试验厂。它是大跃进的产物。开始的时候，工人绝大部分都是机关工作人员，从干部到工人都是些从未见过炼铁的人。但是由于党的领导和大跃进的鼓舞，他们战胜了万难，突破了重关，用拿笔杆子的双手建起了小高炉，炼出了铁。省、市的领导同志对他们非常关怀，经常来厂了解情况指导工作，在最困难的时候，总是为他们指路，给他们撑腰；工作上稍有成绩就表扬和奖励他们。这个厂就是在领导上这样关怀下诞生和成长起来的，现在已经有三立方米和十三立方米的小高炉各两座，还有洋灰、铸造、机修三个附属车间。
    小高炉能高产优质
    开始建炉的时候，领导上就嘱咐他们“要作个榜样，千方百计地使小高炉多出铁，出好铁”。这是一个重大而光荣的责任，他们始终把它作为一切活动的总要求。
    要建炉了，可是没有建筑工人。怎么办？他们就自己干。虽然大家都不会，但是很注意质量，干得很细致。他们懂得：“好鸡下好蛋，有了好炉子才能多出铁，出好铁”。他们采取了边学、边建、步步为营的办法，遇到困难了，就大家研究或出去学习，决不草率从事。对每一块耐火砖就像对自己的眼睛一样的爱护，千方百计的使它不碎不潮。每砌一块耐火砖都要量一下，不合规格马上翻修，从而创造了高产优质的条件。
    “有了好马，还得会骑”。在开始生产的时候，首先碰到的是产量低、事故多。如何保证正常生产多出铁呢？可把他们难坏了。为了解决这个问题，大家急得觉也睡不着，饭也吃不下，围着炉子转来转去想办法。车间主任于淑祥、炉长干新生和于志增两个多月没有离开炉子到宿舍睡过觉。他们说：要叫炉子出铁比降虎还难”。但是他们并没有失掉信心。他们首先从研究生产上的具体事故入手积累经验。发现了“棚料”，就和群众一起并聘请兄弟厂的技术人员来实行“土洋医生联合会诊”。对待事故一贯是采取“防重于治”的原则。炉上有专人负责，每十五分钟检查一次炉况。一旦发生了事故，就分析原因，接受教训。同时，他们还不断地举行反事故演习，以提高警惕，丰富生产经验。小高炉终于一个个的被驯服了，十三立方米小高炉的日产量由十三吨左右，提高到十八吨左右，其中“跃进号”高炉最高日产达到二十九吨，利用系数达到二以上。炼出的铁成排成行。正如他们所歌唱的：
    杜鹃只在三月红，石榴不过五月中。
    唯有铁花开不败，不分春夏和秋冬。
    炼铁，要求高产又优质。高产还容易些，可是达到优质就要用更大的努力。障碍达到优质的，主要的是硫——这个钢铁的大敌在捣蛋。今年2月份，上级提出了猛攻高硫多出好铁的号召。因为他们是省委、省人委的试验厂，当然应该一马当先积极响应。于是这个厂的领导干部首先向全体职工讲明了多出好铁的政治意义和经济意义，并且具体讲明了什么叫硫，硫的害处和如何脱硫，然后和群众一起研究办法，结论是脱硫必须采取综合措施。因此他们就处处设关，关关脱硫，炉内炉外双管齐下。他们还编了个脱硫歌，一边炼铁，一边唱着：
    矿石焙烧烧死你，提高炉温烫死你，
    拌上石灰搅死你，撒下石灰收复你，
    步步设下脱硫关，磕头遵命才饶你。
    经过了四昼夜的努力，终于降服了高硫，铁的含硫量由零点二五七降到零点零五以下，合格率达到90％以上。
    到底能不能做到高产优质，在很大程度上决定于原料准备的好坏，这就像人缺乏营养身体就不健康一样，因此，他们时刻都注意加强原料的管理工作。原料进厂以后，分别按矿区堆存，并按进厂日期登记，经过化验以后再加工入炉。他们坚持“四不入炉”：即料不合格不入炉、不干不入炉、不净不入炉、成分不明不入炉。事实证明，事在人为，只要干劲大，操作好，不怕困难，苦心钻研，小高炉也能高产、优质。
    通过生产实践和学习技术理论，他们逐步摸到了小高炉的生产规律：在原料方面必须使小高炉吃细、吃好、吃熟、吃热；在操作方面必须做到“三勤、一强、一高、两稳”，即勤观察、勤分析研究、勤联系协作，强风、高温，稳定风温，稳定风量。为了使高产优质能够巩固下来，发展下去，他们把这一来自群众中的经验集中起来形成制度，加强了技术管理，制定和统一了操作规程。
      小高炉也能盈利
    高产、优质的问题逐步解决了，这时上级指示要实行经济核算。问题又出来了。有人说：“咱们干的就是赔钱的买卖，还能不赔钱。”有人想拆台散伙，说：“必得干这种赔钱的买卖吗？算了吧！”从机关上来的部分同志想归队。这些思想活动，从小处说是反映了对小高炉炼铁不亏本缺乏信心；从大处说是对两条腿走路的方针发生怀疑。这是关系着厂的前途和命运问题。厂党委对这个问题进行了研究，认为：大中小并举是党的方针，坚决要办，既然能炼出铁来，就完全可以不赔本。于是，首先向群众算了降低成本的政治账，然后又交了经济底，接着就和群众一起研究降低成本的办法。经过群众讨论，认为根本办法就是优质高产。5月份多产了四百吨好铁，对成本下降起了决定性的作用。但光这样做还不够，大家又围绕着如何降低成本这个中心开展了技术革新和合理化建议。如改进了焙烧方法，全年可以节省很多燃料；用煤气烧锅炉一年可以省煤一百八十多吨，同时采取了许多办法，大大减少了原料的损耗。
    经过这一系列的措施，降低成本有了明显的成绩。群众说：“过去我们只知道投料出铁，缺了就要，坏了就扔，这个干法还有不赔本的？”大家对降低成本有了迫切要求，而且充满信心。在这个基础上，便建立了经济核算制度，加强了成本管理。由于采取上述措施，今年5月份第一次由亏本转为盈利，上缴利润四千多元。事实证明了小高炉亏本并不是命中注定的，只要领导有决心，放手发动群众，采取积极的行动，不仅能够做到不亏本，而且可以盈利。
        真正的试验厂
    这个炼铁试验厂成立一年多来，事事带头，凡是党的号召，党的指示，都积极响应，首先作出榜样。因此省市领导机关常在这个厂开现场会议。今年以来，有一百一十二个单位，一千二百多人来厂参观。他们还为兄弟厂培养了五百多名炉前工。兄弟厂的炉子发生了故障，他们就积极派人去协助解决，不管是白天、黑夜、刮风、下雨，随叫随到。
    在物资方面，只要他们有，兄弟厂需要就积极支援。前些日子他们听说酒精厂缺鼓风机，就让出一个给他们；听说棉织八厂缺电动机，也让了一个给他们。虽然这些东西自己也需要，但为了建设社会主义，他们充分发挥了共产主义大协作的精神。
    他们也清楚地认识到：要想真正地起到试验厂的作用，还必须虚心诚恳地向兄弟厂学习，取别人的长处，补自己的短处，以不断前进和提高。仅是今年以来，他们专门派人出去学习二十九次之多，学来了粉焦机、矿粉自动过筛、自熔性烧结法、煤气焙烧，等等。
