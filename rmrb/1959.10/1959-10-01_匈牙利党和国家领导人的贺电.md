To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
    Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party,
    Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow us to extend to you, and on behalf of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, our warmest respects and best wishes to the fraternal Chinese people. Ten years ago, the People's Republic of China was founded as a result of a victory of world historical significance. This victory ended the long and arduous struggle and glorious revolutionary war of the heroic Chinese people. The great Chinese people seized power, and under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, eliminated the heavy legacy of the past and embarked on the socialist road to make the motherland prosperous and strong. For ten years, the common goal of building socialism, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and the millions of bonds of fraternal friendship and cooperation in the big family of the socialist camp have closely linked our two countries and their peoples together. The Hungarian people watch the great efforts of the Chinese people with fraternal sympathy, and look with admiration at the significant achievements the Chinese people have made in the past ten years. We are amazed by your brilliant achievements, especially the achievements of 1958—the year of the Great Leap Forward, the achievements that continue to be made this year, and the great prospect of completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Because of these achievements, a strong People's Republic of China, which is building socialism, has been established on the basis of a country that was plundered and enslaved ten years ago. The reactionaries and imperialist forces are trying to directly or indirectly hinder the development of the People's Republic of China and its friendship with other Asian countries. The Hungarian people and its government firmly condemn the conspiracies of international reactionaries, fully support the consistent peaceful policy pursued by the People's Republic of China, and fully support its just struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands illegally occupied by US imperialism, and demand that the People's China with a population of 680 million people occupy its legitimate seat in the United Nations. On behalf of the Hungarian working people, we wholeheartedly wish the fraternal friendship between our two peoples will last forever.

    Dobi István, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic
    Kádár János, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party
    Münnich Ferenc, Premier of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government
                    September 29, 1959, in Budapest

    匈牙利党和国家领导人的贺电
    中华人民共和国主席　刘少奇同志，
    中国共产党主席　毛泽东同志，
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来同志：
    当此中华人民共和国建国十周年之际，请允许我们向你们，并代表匈牙利人民共和国主席团、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、匈牙利工农革命政府和我国人民向兄弟般的中国人民致以最热烈的敬意和良好的祝愿。十年前，由于取得具有世界历史意义的胜利而成立了中华人民共和国。这一胜利结束了英勇的中国人民长期的艰苦斗争和光荣的革命战争。伟大的中国人民取得了政权，并在光荣的中国共产党领导下消灭了过去的沉重遗产，走上了使祖国繁荣富强的社会主义道路。十年来，建设社会主义的共同目标、马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和社会主义阵营大家庭中的兄弟般的友谊和合作的千万条纽带把我们两国及其人民紧密地联系在一起。匈牙利人民怀着兄弟般的同情注视着中国人民的巨大的努力，并以钦佩的眼光注视着中国人民在过去十年中所获得的重大成就。在你们的光辉成就中，特别是1958年——大跃进一年的成就，今年继续取得的成就以及提前完成第二个五年计划的伟大前景使我国人民感到惊讶。由于这些成就，在十年前还是被掠夺被奴役国家的基础上建立起了一个强大的、正在建设社会主义的中华人民共和国。反动派和帝国主义势力竭力想直接或间接地阻挠中华人民共和国发展它同其他亚洲国家的友谊。匈牙利人民及其政府坚决谴责国际反动派的阴谋，完全支持中华人民共和国一贯奉行的和平政策，并且完全支持它为解放被美帝国主义非法占领的台湾和沿海岛屿而进行的正义斗争，并要求让拥有六亿八千万人口的人民中国在联合国中占有自己的合法地位。我们代表匈牙利劳动人民衷心地祝我们两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青。
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席　道比·伊斯特万
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记  卡达尔·亚诺什
    匈牙利工农革命政府总理　明尼赫·费伦茨
                    1959年9月29日于布达佩斯
