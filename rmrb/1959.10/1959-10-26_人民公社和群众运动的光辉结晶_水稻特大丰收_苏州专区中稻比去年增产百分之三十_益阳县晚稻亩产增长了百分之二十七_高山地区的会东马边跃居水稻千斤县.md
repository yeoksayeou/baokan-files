Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th - Jiangsu Province's Suzhou Special District achieved a great bumper harvest of mid-season rice in the first year after communization. The area's 2.3 million mu of mid-season rice has been harvested, and after verification at all levels, the average yield per mu is 840.5 jin, an increase of 30% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, exceeding the contracted target by 10%, and the total output also increased by 30% compared with last year.

This year, the characteristics of the great bumper harvest of mid-season rice in Suzhou Special District are: high-yield areas are even higher, low-yield areas have doubled, and there are bumper harvests everywhere, with comprehensive production increases. Jiangyin County, which had the highest mid-season rice yield in the province last year, created a new high-yield record of 900 jin per mu on its 810,000 mu of mid-season rice this year. The average yield per mu of Changshu County's 420,000 mu of mid-season rice also reached 900 jin. There were 16 communes with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, 401 production brigades with yields of over 1,000 jin, 4,343 production teams with yields of over 1,000 jin, and 373,379 mu of high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin. Wu Jiang, Kunshan and other counties, which have historically had low mid-season rice yields, have also seen their mid-season rice yields jump from 500-600 jin in the past to 700-800 jin this year, and have basically eliminated low-yield fields below 500 jin.

The great bumper harvest of mid-season rice in Suzhou Special District this year is the result of holding high the glorious banner of the General Line, vigorously carrying out mass movements, giving full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, overcoming a series of natural disasters such as drought, insects, and wind, and fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. After the summer harvest ended this year, the situation was widely discussed throughout the district, educating cadres and the masses, and raising ideological levels; at the same time, the experience of the 1958 mid-season rice bumper harvest was carefully summarized, the conditions and potential for increased production in 1959 were analyzed, various right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized, and the idea of "leap forward again and again, there is no limit to the upstream" was established. Subsequently, on the basis of vigorously carrying out ideological work, increased production measures such as deep plowing, close planting, good seeds, sufficient fertilizer, and early planting were implemented.

This year, mid-season rice transplanting was generally about ten days earlier than in previous years. Appropriate early planting promoted early heading and early maturity of mid-season rice. The management of mid-season rice was also earlier and better than in any previous year. Especially when mid-season rice was hit by drought, insects, typhoons and other disasters, the vast number of cadres and masses in the district carried out a resolute struggle against natural disasters, ensuring a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th - Yiyang County, Hunan Province, overcame severe drought and achieved a great bumper harvest of single-season late rice. As of October 17, 220,000 mu of the county's 240,000 mu of single-season late rice had been harvested, with an average yield of 731 jin per mu, an increase of 27% compared with 1958. Two "thousand-jin" (average yield of 1,000 jin per mu) communes, more than ten "thousand-jin" brigades, and dozens of "thousand-jin" production teams emerged in the county. In addition, there were 24 brigades and 143 production teams with yields above 800 jin, and more than 73,800 mu of "thousand-jin" mu.

The county's single-season late rice was threatened by severe drought during its growing period. The county experienced 130 days of drought and little rain from early June to October 13. However, leaders at all levels and all cadres and the masses in the county, with the heroic spirit of overturning rivers and seas, launched a struggle against the drought. Through continuous anti-Rightist efforts and encouragement, water was sought from rivers and lakes and from underground, and drought resistance ensured the seedlings, finally winning a bumper harvest.

In the fight against drought, the People's Communes displayed unparalleled power. Based on the principle of equal exchange, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, the communes fostered a strong atmosphere of cooperation, engaged in large-scale operations, and carried out large-scale cooperation in labor, tools, and water sources. At the same time, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture was implemented concretely, comprehensively, and in accordance with local conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th - Following Kaijiang County, Sichuan Province has produced two more counties with rice yields of 1,000 jin. Huidong County's 80,000 mu of rice yielded an average of 1,149 jin per mu, an increase of 48.7% compared with last year; Mabian County's 40,000 mu of rice yielded an average of 1,082 jin per mu, an increase of 17.7% compared with last year.

Both of these counties are located in high mountainous areas, with poor natural conditions. In the past, rice yields were not high, and Mabian County only became a high-yield rice county last year. This year, the rice yield in these two counties crossed the 1,000-jin mark, mainly because after the establishment of the People's Communes, the superiority of "large scale and high degree of public ownership" was brought into full play, and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase was conscientiously implemented.

Last winter, both counties used the strong manpower and material resources of the communes to build a large number of water conservancy projects, laying the foundation for a bumper rice harvest. Mabian County repaired more than 3,000 weirs and more than 100 ponds, and also newly built more than 100 ponds and weirs. These water conservancy projects played a huge role in this year's drought resistance. Huidong County had 20,000 mu of paddy fields threatened by drought during transplanting. However, communes and production teams cooperated with each other, supporting each other, and finally overcame the natural disaster. Mabian County's 27 communes also overcame extremely heavy storms and floods.

This year, rice cultivation in these two counties was meticulous, planted early, appropriately densely planted, and well managed. At the same time, some high-yield command fields were also established, which played a demonstrative role in the implementation of various key production-increasing measures. Huidong County had 5,800 mu of high-yield command fields, with yields 30% to 50% higher than ordinary fields. (Attached picture)

    人民公社和群众运动的光辉结晶
    水稻特大丰收
    苏州专区中稻比去年增产百分之三十
    益阳县晚稻亩产增长了百分之二十七
    高山地区的会东马边跃居水稻千斤县
    据新华社南京25日电　江苏省苏州专区公社化后第一年取得了中稻大丰收。全区二百三十万亩中稻，已收割结束，经过层层验收核实，平均亩产八百四十点五斤，比大跃进的1958年增产30％，比包产指标超产一成，总产量也比去年增产30％。
    今年，苏州专区中稻大丰收的特点是：高产地区更高产，低产地区成倍翻，处处丰收，全面增产。去年中稻产量冠于全省的江阴县，今年八十一万亩中稻又创造了亩产九百斤的高产新纪录。常熟县四十二万亩中稻平均单产也达到九百斤。并出现了亩产千斤以上的公社十六个，千斤以上的生产大队四百零一个，千斤以上的生产小队四千三百四十三个，千斤以上的高产田有三十七万三千三百七十九亩。历来中稻产量较低的吴江、昆山等县，今年中稻产量也都从过去的五、六百斤跃进到七、八百斤，并且基本上消灭了五百斤以下的低产田。
    苏州专区今年中稻大丰收，是高举总路线的光辉旗帜，大搞群众运动，充分发挥人民公社优越性，战胜旱虫风一系列自然灾害和全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的结果。今年夏收一结束，就在全区范围内，大张旗鼓地讲形势，教育干部、群众，提高思想水平；同时认真总结了1958年中稻丰收的经验，分析了1959年增产的条件和潜力，批判了各种右倾保守思想，树立了“跃进再跃进，上游无止境”的思想。接着，在大搞思想工作的基础上，贯彻了深耕、密植、良种、足肥、早栽等增产措施。
    今年中稻栽秧一般比往年提早十天左右。适当早栽，促使中稻早抽穗、早成熟。对中稻的管理，也比以往任何一年都早都好。特别是在中稻遭受旱、虫、台风等灾害侵袭时，全区广大干部和群众与自然灾害进行了坚决的斗争，保证了丰收。
    据新华社长沙25日电　湖南省益阳县战胜严重干旱，单季晚稻获得了大丰收。截至10月17日，全县二十四万亩单季晚稻，已收二十二万亩，平均亩产七百三十一斤，较1958年增产27％。全县出现了两个千斤（平均亩产千斤）社，十多个千斤大队，几十个千斤生产队。另外，还有八百斤以上的大队二十四个、生产队一百四十三个，千斤亩七万三千八百多亩。
    这个县的单季晚稻在生长期中，受到了严重干旱的威胁。全县从6月初到10月13日的一百三十天中，一直干旱少雨。但是，全县各级领导和全体干部、群众，以翻江倒海的英雄气概，与干旱展开了斗争。经过不断反右倾、鼓干劲，向江河要水，向地下要水，抗旱保苗，终于赢得了大丰收。
    在抗旱中，人民公社发挥了无比的威力。各公社根据等价交换互助互利的原则，大兴协作之风，大搞大兵团作战，开展了劳力、工具、水源大协作。同时，具体地、全面地、因地制宜地贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。
    据新华社成都24日电　四川省继开江县之后，又出现了两个水稻千斤县。会东县八万亩水稻，平均亩产一千一百四十九斤，比去年增产48.7％；马边县四万亩水稻，平均亩产一千零八十二斤，比去年增产17.7％。
    这两个县都处在高山区，自然条件并不好，过去水稻产量不高，马边县在去年才成为水稻高产县。今年这两个县水稻跃过千斤关，主要是由于人民公社建立以后，充分发挥“一大二公”的优越性，认真贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”。
    去年冬天，这两个县都运用公社雄厚的人力物力，兴修了大批水利工程，为水稻丰收打下基础。马边县共整修了三千多条堰和一百多口塘，并且新修了塘堰一百多处。这些水利工程在今年抗旱中起了巨大作用。会东县在插秧时，有两万亩稻田遭受干旱威胁。但是公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间实行了大协作，互相支援，终于战胜了自然灾害。马边县二十七个公社，还战胜了特大暴风雨和洪水袭击。
    这两个县的水稻今年耕作细致，栽得早，适当密植，管理得好。同时，还建立了部分高产指挥田，在各个关键性增产措施的贯彻上，起了示范推动作用。会东县有五千八百亩高产指挥田，产量比一般田高出30％到50％。（附图片）
