    The production and use of bacterial fertilizers in our country is something that started after liberation. During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, many counties, people's communes, and production teams across the country universally established bacterial fertilizer plants. Due to the poor foundation in the past and weak technical strength, some problems still exist in the production and use of bacterial fertilizers. For example, the number of effective bacteria per gram of bacterial agent in some products is not high, and the quality is low; the publicity and technical guidance work is not done well enough, so some people are not very familiar with the role and effect of bacterial fertilizers; the large dosage and high cost also cause some waste; the planning of production and supply is poor, and in some areas, bacterial fertilizers have been overproduced, resulting in stockpiling, and even becoming ineffective after being stored for too long. Here we will only discuss the production and application technology of bacterial fertilizers.
    
    The Characteristics and Functions of Bacterial Fertilizers
    Fertilizer is a substance that contains plant nutrients, such as chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements, or organic fertilizers containing various nutrients. Applying these fertilizers to the ground can increase soil fertility and increase crop yield. However, bacterial fertilizer itself does not contain plant nutrient elements, but increases or improves plant nutrition in the soil through the activities of these beneficial microorganisms, thereby increasing crop yield and improving soil fertility.
    
    There are many types of bacterial fertilizers, and different types of bacterial fertilizers have different functions.
    
    Rhizobium: It is a kind of bacterial fertilizer limited to leguminous crops. When leguminous seeds germinate, rhizobia invade the root cells of leguminous crops and gradually form nodules. In these nodules, there are thousands of rhizobia growing, which can fix a large amount of nitrogen in the air that plants cannot directly use, and supply it for plant growth. At the same time, rhizobia also absorb various other nutrients needed for their growth from the plant. This relationship between rhizobia and legumes is called symbiosis. Various leguminous crops have their corresponding rhizobia. If peanut rhizobia are inoculated on soybeans, nodules cannot be formed, nor will there be nitrogen fixation. However, there are also a few rhizobium species that can be mutually inoculated on several legumes.
    
    Azotobacter: Azotobacter is also a microorganism that can fix nitrogen in the air. Unlike rhizobia, it lives in the soil all the time, that is, its nitrogen fixation activity takes place in the soil at the roots of plants. Azotobacter relies on decomposing organic matter in the soil or secretions from crop roots to obtain the energy it needs for life. Other nutrients it needs are also absorbed from the soil. Therefore, the quality of the soil environment plays a decisive role in its growth and reproduction and even the strength of its nitrogen fixation ability. Azotobacter can also secrete auxin to stimulate crop growth. This bacterial fertilizer can be applied to various crops and vegetables.
    
    In addition to the above two main bacterial fertilizers, phosphate bacteria, potassium bacteria, butyric acid bacteria, antagonistic bacteria, and a small amount of mixed bacterial fertilizers are currently being promoted. The function of phosphate bacterial fertilizer is to decompose organic phosphorus in the soil that cannot be directly used by crops into absorbable inorganic phosphorus. This kind of bacterial fertilizer works well in soil with high organic matter content or with a large amount of organic fertilizer. Potassium bacteria can convert potassium-containing minerals in the soil that cannot be directly used by plants into potassium in a form that plants can absorb. However, these two microorganisms cannot increase the phosphorus and potassium elements in the soil. Butyric acid bacteria can also fix nitrogen, but its nitrogen fixation capacity is lower than that of azotobacter. Antagonistic bacteria are bacterial fertilizers made from a type of actinomycetes. Using this fertilizer can enhance the crop's ability to resist diseases and also stimulate crop growth. Mixed bacterial fertilizers are made using a variety of beneficial microorganisms. The main function of these microorganisms is to decompose organic matter in the soil, activate various nutrients in the soil, and stimulate crop growth. Using mixed bacterial fertilizers is also a method of directly using soil microorganisms to improve soil fertility and increase yield.
    
    The effectiveness of all bacterial fertilizers depends on the life activities of these microorganisms. Therefore, bacterial fertilizers cannot be simply understood as fertilizers that fix nitrogen or transform certain nutrients, and they will not work as soon as they are applied to the ground. Because they are living organisms, it is also necessary to pay attention to creating the conditions necessary for these organisms to grow and reproduce in order to maximize their effectiveness. For example, they generally require certain pH conditions and humidity for the soil, and require a certain amount of organic matter as a source of energy for life activities, etc.
    
    At present, the effect of rhizobium is the best among the bacterial fertilizers we promote. According to the experimental materials of scientific research institutions in Northeast China, North China, Henan and other places over the years and the promotion experience in vast areas, compared with those who have not used rhizobium, it can increase production by 10%-15%. Azotobacter has been proven to increase production by around 10% in trials in some areas, but the yield increase effect of azotobacter in some areas is not very stable. Although phosphate, potassium, butyric acid and other bacterial fertilizers have been promoted in some areas, the effects are inconsistent in various places and need to be further tested.
    
      Production of Bacterial Fertilizers
    The quality of bacterial fertilizers directly affects the yield increase effect. A good quality bacterial fertilizer not only requires good strains, but also has a large number of live bacteria in a certain unit.
    
    The following points must be paid attention to in the production process: ① The production of bacterial fertilizers must select excellent strains. Excellent strains have strong vitality and have a wide adaptability to the conditions of crops and soil. Our country has a vast territory, and soil and climate conditions vary from place to place. The effect of bacterial fertilizers is often affected by external conditions, and the performance varies. Therefore, the strains selected for bacterial fertilizers must be strains that are suitable for the local area and have been rigorously tested in the field. Foreign strains cannot be used for production casually. The production of commercial bacterial fertilizers must undergo a strict disinfection and sterilization process. Failure to pay attention to disinfection and sterilization will inevitably cause a large number of miscellaneous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria to multiply, causing the product to spoil and become moldy; more attention should be paid to disinfection when producing mother agents, and they must not contain miscellaneous bacteria. Using bacterial fertilizers containing miscellaneous bacteria for seed mixing is likely to cause crop diseases. Some bacterial fertilizer plants still do not pay enough attention to this problem. The number of miscellaneous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria contained in the bacterial fertilizers produced by many plants often exceeds the number of effective bacteria.
    
    ② The specifications of the product generally require that the number of live bacteria per gram of bacterial fertilizer should be more than 50 million, and phosphate bacterial fertilizer should exceed 100 million, and the number of miscellaneous bacteria contained should be less than 10%. Bacterial fertilizers with less than 50 million live bacteria per gram should not be promoted as commercial fertilizers. Most of the bacterial fertilizers currently produced do not meet this standard and should be actively improved.
    
    ③ At present, the ex-factory price of bacterial fertilizers is relatively high. For example, the bacterial fertilizer purchased by Xihua County, Henan Province costs 3.25 yuan per catty, and it is not cost-effective even if each catty of bacterial fertilizer can increase the yield of 20 or 30 catties of grain. To produce bacterial fertilizers in large quantities, cheap raw materials must be used. During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production last year, the masses broke superstitions and created many successful experiences: using cheap grain or tuber slurries with high starch content instead of white sugar and glucose; using ordinary chemical fertilizers instead of certain expensive chemicals; cultivating bacteria without or with less agar, etc. After adopting these methods, they greatly reduced production costs and the product quality was also very good. It would be great if each catty of bacterial fertilizer only costs a few cents and can increase the yield of 20 or 30 catties of grain.
    
    ④ Bacterial fertilizers cannot be stored for a long time and are seasonal in use; at the same time, the technology for producing bacterial fertilizers is not complicated, so they should be produced locally and promoted for local use. We believe that it is enough for a county or several adjacent counties to establish a factory with disinfection and sterilization equipment; simple small factories in communes and production teams can purchase mother agents or strains for cultivation and reproduction, and there is no need to set up large bacterial fertilizer plants with sterilization equipment.
    
      Application of Bacterial Fertilizers
    Bacterial fertilizer is a biological fertilizer. When applied to the ground, it can reproduce better and give better yield increase benefits when there is a suitable environment. At the same time, bacterial fertilizer is an auxiliary fertilizer. It is not an "all-purpose fertilizer." Bacterial fertilizer cannot replace organic fertilizer or chemical fertilizer. In other words, after applying bacterial fertilizer, other fertilizers, especially organic fertilizers, must still be applied as usual. The following points should be noted when using bacterial fertilizers:
    
    ① The most effective way to use rhizobium is to mix it with seeds, so that the bacteria adhere to the seeds, and root nodules can be formed quickly after the seeds germinate. Other bacterial fertilizers can be mixed with seeds, dipped in seedling roots, or mixed in organic fertilizers for use as base fertilizer. If the quality of the bacterial fertilizer is not good, it is best to mix it with organic fertilizer; it is better to use it as a base fertilizer than as a top dressing, because microorganisms have a long time to be active in the soil, which can make bacterial fertilizers play a role earlier.
    
    ② When applying bacterial fertilizers, attention must be paid to applying organic fertilizers. It is not advisable to apply bacterial fertilizers alone in barren soils with very little organic matter. According to experiments, applying mixed bacterial fertilizer to unfertilized soil reduced wheat production by 4%; however, when applied with organic fertilizer, wheat production increased by 7%. In too acidic soil, if lime is not applied in combination, the effect of azotobacter or phosphate bacterial fertilizer will be reduced or even completely ineffective.
    
    ③ When applying bacterial fertilizers in summer, avoid exposing the fertilizer to the sun. Bacteria are easily killed or die due to loss of water when exposed to the sun. If bacterial fertilizer is used for seed mixing, the seeds should be placed in a shaded place after mixing. For other uses, the soil should also be covered at any time after application. Cold winters are also not suitable for applying bacterial fertilizers, as the bacteria can easily be frozen to death.
    
    ④ Bacterial fertilizers cannot be mixed with chemical fertilizers. Because the concentration of chemical fertilizers is very high, it can cause the death of microorganisms; however, bacterial fertilizers and chemical fertilizers can be applied to the ground successively or separately. Bacterial fertilizers should not be applied at the same time as pesticides, especially pesticides containing mercury, because pesticides can prevent the reproduction of microorganisms or kill microorganisms. Therefore, bacterial fertilizers must be applied about a week before or after using pesticides.
    
    Some people think that the more fertilizer applied, the better, which is not correct. Generally, half a catty to one catty of good quality bacterial fertilizer per mu is enough. Bacterial fertilizer is a slow-release fertilizer. From the external morphology of crops, changes are not obvious in a short period of time, but this cannot negate its yield-increasing effect.
    
    The adaptability of bacterial fertilizers to regions, the adaptability to crops, the selection and identification of excellent strains, the improvement of operating techniques for bacterial fertilizer production or application, the effect test of bacterial fertilizers, etc., all need to be carefully studied further in various places.

    细菌肥料的生产和使用
    在我国制造和使用细菌肥料，还是解放以后的事情。1958年农业生产大跃进，全国许多县、人民公社和生产队，普遍建立了细菌肥料厂。由于过去基础差，技术力量薄弱，在细菌肥料的生产和使用上，还存在一些问题。例如部分产品中每克菌剂所含的有效菌数不高，质量较低；宣传和技术指导工作做得不够，因而部分群众还不很熟悉细菌肥料的作用和效果；因为用量大，成本高，也造成一些浪费；生产和供应的计划性差，有些地区的细菌肥料因为生产过多，造成了积压现象，甚至贮放过久而失效。这里我们仅就细菌肥料的生产、应用技术来谈谈。
    细菌肥料的特征和功能
    肥料，是某种含有植物营养的物质，如含有氮、磷、钾元素的化学肥料，或含有多种养分的有机肥料，把这些肥料施到地里，能够增加土壤肥力，提高作物的产量。但细菌肥料本身却不含植物营养元素，而是通过这些有益的微生物活动来增加或改善土壤中的植物营养，因而使作物的产量增加，土壤肥力提高。
    细菌肥料的种类很多，不同种类的细菌肥料，具有不同的作用。
    根瘤菌：它是限于豆科作物上使用的一种细菌肥料。当豆科种子发芽后，根瘤菌即侵入豆科作物的根系细胞，逐渐形成一个个的瘤子，在这些根瘤里生长着千千万万的根瘤菌，它们能够大量地固定空气中植物不能直接利用的氮素，供给植物生长的需要。同时，根瘤菌也从植物体内吸取它们生长所需的其他各种养分。根瘤菌和豆科的这种关系，叫作共生。各种豆科作物都有其相适应的根瘤菌，如果把花生的根瘤菌接种在大豆上，就不能形成根瘤，也没有固氮作用。但也有少数的根瘤菌种，可以在几种豆科上互相接种。
    固氮菌：固氮菌也是一种能固定空气中氮素的微生物。它和根瘤菌不同，一直生活在土壤里，也就是说它的固氮活动是在植物根处的土壤中进行。固氮菌靠分解土壤中的有机物质或作物根系的分泌物取得生活所需要的能源。它所需要的其他营养物质，也从土壤里吸取，因而所处的土壤环境好坏，对它的生长繁殖以至于固氮能力强弱起着决定性的作用。固氮菌还能分泌生长素，刺激作物生长。这种细菌肥料对各种作物和蔬菜都能应用。
    除了上述两种主要细菌肥料之外，目前推广的还有磷细菌、钾细菌、丁酸细菌、抗生菌及少量的混合细菌肥料。磷细菌肥料的作用是把土壤中作物不能直接利用的有机磷分解成可吸收形态的无机磷，这种菌肥在土壤中含有机质多或在大量使用有机肥料的情况下效果良好。钾细菌能把土壤中植物不能直接利用的含钾矿物，转化成植物可吸收形态的钾。但是这两种微生物并不能增加土壤中的磷、钾元素。丁酸细菌也能固氮，固氮能力比固氮菌低。抗生菌是用一种放线菌制成的细菌肥料，使用这种肥料能增强作物抵抗病害的能力，同时也有刺激作物生长的作用。混合细菌肥料是利用多种有益的微生物制成的，这些微生物的主要功用是分解土壤中的有机质，活化土壤中的各种养分，刺激作物生长。使用混合细菌肥料也是直接利用土壤微生物提高土壤肥力，以提高产量的一种方法。
    一切细菌肥料的有效作用取决于这些微生物的生命活动，因而不能简单地把细菌肥料理解成固氮或转化某些养分的肥料，只要施到地里就能发挥作用。因为它们是生物，所以还必须注意创造这些生物生长繁殖所需的条件，才能使其发挥大的效能。例如一般都对土壤要求一定的酸碱条件和湿度，需要一定的有机质做为生命活动的能源等等。
    目前我们所推广的细菌肥料以根瘤菌的效果最好。据东北、华北、河南等地的科学研究机构历年的试验材料和广大地区的推广经验证明，使用过根瘤菌的和不使用的对比，能增产10％—15％，固氮菌在部分地区试验证明，可增产10％上下，但有些地区使用固氮菌的增产效果不很稳定。磷、钾、丁酸等其他细菌肥料，在部分地区虽然已经推广，但效果在各地表现的不一致，需要继续进行试验。
      细菌肥料的生产
    细菌肥料的质量好坏，直接影响增产的效果。质量好的细菌肥料，不仅是所选的菌种要好，而且在一定的单位内所含的活菌数量也多。
    在生产过程中必须注意以下几点：①生产细菌肥料必须选择优良的菌种，优良的菌种具有强大的生活力，对作物和土壤的条件适应性较宽。我们国家幅员广大，各地土壤、气候条件不同，细菌肥料的作用，往往受到外界条件影响，表现的效果不一。因此，选用做细菌肥料的菌种，必须是适合本地区的经过严格的大田试验过的菌种，不能随便使用外来菌种进行生产。生产商品细菌肥料，必须经过严格的消毒杀菌过程。不重视消毒杀菌，必然会引起杂菌，病菌大量繁殖，使产品腐败发霉；生产母剂更应该注意消毒，不能含有杂菌。使用含有杂菌的细菌肥料拌种，很可能引起作物病害。现在有一些细菌肥料厂，对这个问题还不够重视，不少厂子所产的细菌肥料含的杂菌，病菌往往超过有效菌的数量。
    ②产品的规格，一般情况要求每克细菌肥料的活菌数目应有五千万个以上，磷细菌肥料应超过一亿，所含的杂菌数量应少于10％。每克细菌肥料的活菌数少于五千万个的不应做为商品肥料推销。目前生产的细菌肥料大部都达不到这个标准，应该积极设法改进。
    ③目前细菌肥料的出厂价格较高，如河南西华县购进的细菌肥料每斤价三元二角五分，而每斤菌肥即使能增产二、三十斤粮食，那是不合算的。大量生产细菌肥料，必须采用廉价的原料。在去年农业生产大跃进中，群众破除迷信，创造了很多成功的经验：用廉价的含淀粉多的谷类或薯类的粉浆代替白糖和葡萄糖；利用普通的化学肥料代替某些价高的化学药品；培养细菌不用或少用洋菜等等。他们采用了这些办法之后，大大地降低了生产成本，而且产品质量也很好。如果每斤细菌肥料只花费几分钱，就能增产二、三十斤粮食，那就很好了。
    ④细菌肥料不能长期保存，在使用上又有季节性；同时生产细菌肥料的技术不复杂，所以应该就地生产，就地推广使用。我们认为一个县或相邻的几个县建立一个具有消毒杀菌设备的厂子就够用了；公社和生产队的简易小厂可以购买母剂或菌种，进行培养繁殖，不必举办大的具有杀菌设备的细菌肥料厂。
      细菌肥料的应用
    细菌肥料是一种生物肥料，施到地里有了适宜的环境，便能繁殖得更好，发挥增产效益。同时，细菌肥料又是一种辅助性的肥料，它不是什么“万能肥”，细菌肥料不能代替有机肥料或化学肥料。换句话说，施用了细菌肥料，必须照常施用其他肥料，特别是有机肥料。细菌肥料的使用方法有以下几点：
    ①使用根瘤菌最有效的方法就是进行拌种，使细菌粘在种子上，种子发芽后即能很快地形成根瘤。其他的细菌肥料拌种、醮秧根或混在有机肥料做基肥施用都可以。如果细菌肥料的质量不好，最好与有机肥混合施用；做基肥比做追肥好，因为微生物在土壤中活动的时间长，这可以使细菌肥料提早发挥作用。
    ②施用细菌肥料，必须重视施用有机肥料。在贫瘠的含有机质非常少的土壤中，不宜单独施用细菌肥料。根据试验，把混合细菌肥料施到不施肥的土壤中，小麦减产4％；可是与有机肥料同时施用，小麦增产7％。在太酸的土壤中如不配合施用石灰，固氮菌或磷细菌肥料的效果就会降低，以至完全无效。
    ③夏季施用细菌肥料，应避免肥料被太阳曝晒。细菌在太阳下曝晒，很容易晒死或因失掉水分而死亡。细菌肥料如用作拌种，拌种后要放在有遮荫的地方。其他用法，施用之后也应随时复土。严寒的冬季也不适合施用细菌肥料，因为容易把细菌冻死。
    ④细菌肥料不能和化学肥料混合施用。因为化学肥料的浓度很大，能引起微生物的死亡；但细菌肥料和化学肥料先后或分别施到地里是可以的。细菌肥料不宜与农药，特别是含有汞的农药同时施用，因农药能防碍微生物繁殖或杀死微生物，所以必须在使用农药之前或以后一个星期左右再施用细菌肥料。
    有人认为施肥量越多越好，这是不对的。质量好的细菌肥料，一般每亩用半斤到一斤就可以了。细菌肥是一种慢性肥料，从作物外部形态来看，在短时间内变化并不明显，但不能因此否定它的增产效果。
    细菌肥料对地域的适应性，对作物的适应性，优良菌种的选育、鉴定，细菌肥料生产或应用的操作技术的提高，细菌肥料的效果试验等等工作，都还需要各地细致地进一步地进行研究。
