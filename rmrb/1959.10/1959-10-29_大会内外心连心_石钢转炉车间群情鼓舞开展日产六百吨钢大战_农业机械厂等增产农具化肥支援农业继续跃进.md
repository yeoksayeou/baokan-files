    Hearts Linked Inside and Outside the Conference
    Shijiazhuang Steel Plant's Converter Workshop Enthusiastically Launches Campaign to Produce 600 Tons of Steel Daily
    Agricultural Machinery Plant and Others Increase Production of Farm Tools and Fertilizers to Support Agriculture's Continued Leap Forward
    Inside the Great Hall of the People, heroes gather, a myriad of stars shining brightly. Outside the Great Hall, a million workers in the capital link their hearts with those of the more than six thousand representatives attending the Conference of Heroes, using the most resolute and swift actions to fulfill the vows made to the Conference: to respond to the Party's call to the working class and the people of the whole country to advance towards even more distant goals.
    In the past two days, news of new achievements, new technologies, and early completion of plans have been pouring in from the industrial, basic construction, transportation, and financial and trade fronts of the capital to report good news to the Conference of Heroes, and the workers' political enthusiasm is becoming more and more intense. Many workers have repeatedly broken their past records, and advanced producer representatives from many units, while attending the conference, have been in constant communication with the workers in their factories, mines, enterprises, workshops, and teams, bringing new production achievements to the conference and telling their partners about the grand occasion of the conference, encouraging them to advance more bravely. From the 21st to the 25th, the average daily industrial output value of the city increased by 9.2% compared with the previous five days, and one hundred and one factories and enterprises completed their October production plans ahead of schedule.
    The workers of the converter workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, an advanced collective attending the National "Conference of Heroes," just entrusted their representative, Ma Ruiqing, the director of the workshop, to bring the good news of production to the conference on the 24th. On the 25th, they put forward a new combat goal and launched a "600 tons per day" steel production campaign. Each work section and team was as united as one, with steelmakers helping to remove slag and ingot casters helping to repair furnaces. Li Tai, an old worker in the blower room in his fifties, guaranteed that the converter would have as much wind as it needed, and led female wind-sending workers such as Bi Xiuzhen and Xu Xiuying to actively help the furnace workers crush and load materials. The furnace fire made them sweat profusely. Li Tai said: "The heat of the steel can't compare to the heat in my heart! We decided not to let go for a second, not to let a ton go." Crane operator Feng Shijun improved the crane operation process, reducing the time for each hoisting of molten iron from three minutes to two minutes, and then to one minute. The workers in Xu Yuqi's smelting team were all novices who had just arrived at the furnace. Under the slogan of "Reporting Victory to the National Conference of Heroes," they tried every means to become familiar with the "temperament" of the furnace, poured the materials more evenly, predicted the smelting time more accurately, and mastered the new technology of "single-slag steel tapping," finally creating a new achievement of producing eighteen furnaces per shift, six more furnaces than planned. At midnight on the 25th, this shift created a record of 650 tons per day, exceeding the plan by more than 50%. A few hours later, just as the applause of the opening of the "Conference of Heroes" came from the radio, these heroes in the converter workshop created new achievements: completing the October leap forward plan five days ahead of schedule, increasing steel production by more than 1,300 tons compared with the state plan.
    The entire workforce of the First Basic Construction Engineering Department of the Beijing Electric Power Administration Bureau, which supplies new blood to the capital's industrial front, recently completed the rush installation of China's first 100,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator unit in seventy-six days. Encouraged by the Conference of Heroes, on the 25th they reported good news to the Party with the new achievement of installing the No. 5 boiler ahead of schedule. The workers of the insulation team of this engineering department unanimously made a guarantee before their team leader, Yan Chengyuan, went to attend the Conference of Heroes: We must work hard for three days to ensure that the No. 5 boiler, which is under intense construction, is ignited ahead of schedule. As soon as they saw off the team leader, they began to fight nervously. At night, under the bright light of the searchlights, the workers climbed to the sixteen-meter-high scaffolding to insulate the air supply pipeline. Workers from other teams also came to support. At 23:00 on the 25th, the heroes' oath was fulfilled: the No. 5 boiler, which normally would not have been ignited until late November, ignited a raging flame more than twenty days ahead of schedule.
    The Zhang Baifa Youth Steel Bar Team, a national advanced collective, after completing the October plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule on the 9th, put forward the slogan of "Every task must be completed ahead of schedule, squeeze out people to support" to welcome the National Conference of Heroes. Now, they are helping other basic construction engineering teams work on new construction sites. On the 26th, they saw Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai and other party and state leaders receive the heroes of the presidium of the Conference of Heroes on the television screen, and couldn't help but call out to Zhang Baifa on the screen with joy: Zhang Baifa, please tell Chairman Liu that we have created two new records: the entire team completed two days' tasks in one day on the 26th, and team members Yang You and Chen Baoshan created the team's highest record for tying steel bars.
    The Party and the state's meticulous care and concern for the working class gives the workers infinite strength and encouragement. Shi Chuanxiang, an old worker of the Sanitation Team of Chongwen District, Beijing, was honorably elected as a representative to the National Conference of Heroes and was elected into the presidium of the conference. On the 26th, when the conference was in recess, he called to tell his teammates: he was received by Liu Shaoqi and other party and state leaders at the meeting, and Comrade Shaoqi and others kindly asked him "Are you living well?" "How is your cultural study?" and encouraged him to study culture well in the future. This old sanitation worker with more than 20 years of experience said excitedly: In the old society, we were called "dung collectors, eating the road, sleeping on the road, covered by the ground, covered by the sky, with half a brick as a pillow," now the Party and the state give me such honor, how can I not work better for the people. After receiving the call, the sanitation workers of the entire team expressed unspeakable joy and encouragement, and immediately discussed and decided to increase the number of dung-carrying trips from nineteen to twenty-one per day to ensure the cleanliness and sanitation of the capital and do a good job in accumulating fertilizer to support the eight people's communes of Hongxing and Nanyuan.
    Comrade Li Fuchun's call in his report for "first ensuring the leap forward in agriculture in promoting the continued leap forward in the national economy" received a warm response from the workers in the capital. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has currently produced two hundred and twenty-six more combine harvesters than the total production of the entire year last year. The workers of this factory have made a guarantee to produce one hundred and thirty more by the end of the year to support the great leap forward in agricultural production next year. After listening to the broadcast on the 26th, the workers of the Beijing Chemical Experiment Factory held meetings in each workshop overnight to discuss measures to increase production. The workers in the potassium-magnesium-phosphate fertilizer workshop proposed to improve the operation method to increase the daily output of fertilizer from fifteen tons to twenty-two tons, and to replace metallurgical coke with low-cost anthracite as fuel. This workshop completed the October production plan six days ahead of schedule, and they decided to increase the production of chemical fertilizer by 400 tons in October, and produce 3,000 tons of chemical fertilizer in the fourth quarter, an increase of 136% compared with the average quarterly output in the first three quarters, to contribute to the early realization of the "chemicalization" of agriculture.
    The workers of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store, the red flag on the national commercial front, after sending off their representatives to attend the National Conference of Heroes, successively held two conferences, determined to "add effort to effort, advance to advance", and put forward ten measures to further improve service quality, learn the city's most advanced sales techniques, and increase the variety of goods, to report good news to the Conference of Heroes. In the past two days, people who have entered the department store office have seen more than a dozen messages praising good people and good deeds written on a blackboard newspaper hanging on the wall, many of which are reflections from the masses. In order to create more new achievements to report good news to the Conference of Heroes, the salespersons of this department store are working hard every morning or evening. The food group recently held an interesting performance competition: several young salespersons quickly bundled wine bottles, etc. with ropes, to be fast, firm, and beautiful. Group leader Li Zhen'an created a record of bundling four bottles in nineteen seconds each time, which is thirteen and a half seconds faster than the best result in the Beijing Financial Workers' Business Performance Conference in July. Li Shunkao and Wu Shiqi of the department store group, and Yu Jingwen of the food group also reached the highest record in the city for bundling ceramics, tea sets, and buns respectively. During the competition, the workers did not use a clock to record the time, but looked at the stopwatch to calculate the results. They said: It is possible to race against time on the production front, and we can also race against time on the commercial front!
    The Party's solemn call inspires the capital's million workers to fly forward with greater strides and higher speed. Moving deeds appear every hour, every day, and the surging tide of the mass movement is higher than a wave. These gifts given by the workers to the Party during the conference are only the first step they have taken towards more magnificent and distant goals. •Our reporter•

    大会内外心连心
    石钢转炉车间群情鼓舞开展日产六百吨钢大战
    农业机械厂等增产农具化肥支援农业继续跃进
    人民大会堂里群英缤纷，万星齐明。大会堂外，首都百万职工把自己的心和参加群英会的六千多名代表的心连成一片，用最坚决、迅速的行动，实践着向群英会提出的誓言：响应党在会上对全国工人阶级、全国人民发出的向着更远大目标前进的号召。
    这两天，首都工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸各个战线上，向群英会报喜的新成绩、新技术、提前完成计划的喜讯雪片飞来，职工们的政治热情愈来愈炽烈。许多职工一次又一次地刷新过去的最高纪录，许多单位的先进生产者代表一面参加大会，一面和自己厂矿、企业、车间、小组的职工们音讯频传，把本单位的生产新成就带到大会上，又把大会的盛况，告诉自己的伙伴，鼓舞他们更勇猛地前进。21日到25日，全市工业平均日产值比前五天增长了9.2％，提前完成10月份生产计划的工厂企业有一百零一个。
    出席全国“群英会”的先进集体、石景山钢铁公司转炉车间的职工，24日刚刚托他们的代表——车间主任马瑞卿把生产喜讯带给大会，25日他们又提出了新的战斗目标，开展了“日产六百吨”的夺钢大战。各工段、小组团结得像一个人，炼钢工帮助清渣，铸锭工帮助修炉，风机室五十多岁的老工人李泰保证转炉要多大风就有多大，并且带着毕秀珍、徐秀英等女送风工主动帮助炉前工碎料、上料。炉火烤得他们汗流满面。李泰说：“钢热那有我的心热！我们决定一秒不放，一吨不让。”吊车工冯时均改进了吊车操作过程，把每次吊装铁水的时间由三分钟减到两分、一分。许玉琦吹炼小组工人都是不久前才来到炉前的新手，在“向全国群英会报捷”的口号下，他们千方百计地熟悉炉子的“脾气”，把料投得更均匀，冶炼时间预测得更准，掌握了“单渣出钢法”的新技术，终于创造了班产十八炉的新成绩，比计划多出了六炉钢。25日午夜，这个班创造了日产六百五十吨的最高纪录，超额50％以上完成计划。过了几个小时，正当播音机中传来“群英会”开幕的掌声时，转炉车间的这些英雄们又创造出新的成绩：提前五天完成10月份的跃进计划，比国家计划增产一千三百多吨钢。
    为首都工业战线输送新血液的北京电业管理局第一基建工程处全体工人，不久前以七十六天的时间，突击安装好我国第一台十万瓩汽轮发电机组。在群英会的鼓舞下，25日他们又以提前安装好五号锅炉的新成就向党报了喜。这个工程处保温班的工人在他们的班长颜成渊去参加群英会以前，一致提出了保证：一定要苦战三天，使正在紧张施工的五号锅炉提前点火。刚送走了班长他们就紧张地战斗起来。黑夜，在通明的探照灯光下，工人们攀登到十六米高的脚手架上，为送风管道进行保温工作。别的班的工人也赶来支援。25日晚上二十三点，英雄们的誓言实现了：按常规需要到11月下旬才能点火的五号锅炉，竟提前二十多天燃起了熊熊的烈焰。
    全国先进集体、张百发青年钢筋工突击队9日提前二十一天完成10月份计划后，提出“项项任务要提前，挤出人来就支援”的口号迎接全国群英会。现在，他们正在新的工地上帮助其他基本建设工程队干活。26日他们从电视机的萤光屏上看到刘少奇主席、朱德委员长、周恩来总理等党和国家的领导人接见群英会主席团英雄们，禁不住满怀喜悦高声地呼唤着萤光屏上的张百发说：张百发，请你转告刘主席，我们又创造了两项新纪录：全小队26日一天完成了两天的任务，队员杨友、陈宝山创造了全队绑扎钢筋的最高成绩。
    党和国家对工人阶级无微不至的爱护和关怀，给予工人们无穷的力量和鼓舞。北京市崇文区清洁队老工人时传祥光荣地被选为出席全国群英会的代表，并且被大会选入主席团。26日大会休会时，他打电话告诉队员们说：在会上受到刘少奇主席等党和国家领导人的接见，少奇同志等还亲切地问他“生活得好不好？”“文化学习得怎样？”并鼓励他以后好好学文化。这位有二十多年工龄的老清洁工人十分激动地说：在旧社会，我们被称做“掏大粪的，吃马路，睡马路，铺着地，盖着天，脑袋枕着半块砖，”如今党和国家给自己这样的荣誉，怎能不更好地为人民工作。全队的清洁工人们接到电话后，说不出的欢欣和鼓舞，立即讨论决定把每天送粪的车次由十九车增加到二十一车，保证首都的清洁卫生，做好支援红星、南苑等八个人民公社的积肥工作。
    李富春同志的报告中关于“在促进国民经济继续跃进中首先保证农业跃进”的号召，得到首都职工们的热烈响应。北京农业机械厂目前生产出的联合收割机比去年全年总产量已经超出了二百二十六台，这个厂的职工提出保证，在年底以前再生产出一百三十台，来支援明年的农业生产大跃进。北京化工实验厂职工26日听过广播以后，各车间连夜召开了会议，讨论增产措施。钾镁磷肥车间职工提出要改进操作方法，使化肥日产量由十五吨提高到二十二吨，并且以低成本的无烟煤代替冶金焦作为燃料，这个车间已提前六天完成了10月份生产计划，他们决定10月份再增产四百吨化学肥料，第四季度生产化肥三千吨，比前三季度平均季产量提高136％，为早日实现农业“化学化”多出一把力。
    全国商业战线上的红旗、北京天桥商场的职工欢送了自己的代表出席全国群英会后，连续召开了两次大会，决心作到“干劲加干劲，先进再先进”，并提出了进一步提高服务质量，学习全市最先进的售货技术，增加商品花色品种等十项措施，向群英会报捷。近两天，人们进到商场办公室就看到墙壁上挂着的一块黑板报上，写着十多条表扬好人好事的消息，其中有许多是来自群众的反映。为了创造更多的新成绩向群英会报捷，每逢清晨或晚上，这个商场的售货员都在勤学苦练。食品组最近举行了一次有趣的表演比赛：几个青年售货员用绳子飞快地捆扎着酒瓶子等，要作到迅速、牢固、美观。组长李振安创造了四个瓶子每捆扎一次用时十九秒的纪录，比7月份北京市财务职工业务表演大会上的最好成绩还要快十三秒五。百货组的李顺考、吴士奇，食品组的于静文也分别达到了全市捆扎陶瓷、茶具和包点心的最高纪录。在竞赛时，职工们不是拿时钟来纪录时间，而是看着跑表来计算成绩。他们说：生产战线上可以作到分秒必争，咱们商业战线也一样可以分秒必争！
    党的庄严号召激励着首都百万职工以更大的步伐和更高的速度飞奔向前。每个小时，每一天都有动人的事迹出现，群众运动的滚滚热潮一浪高过一浪。大会期间职工们给党的这些献礼，只是他们朝着更宏伟、远大目标跨出的第一步。·本报记者·
