Xinhua News Agency report:
Master Xirao Gyatso, President of the Buddhist Association of China, issued a statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly. The full text is as follows:

The United Nations General Assembly, under the planning and manipulation of the United States, has surprisingly discussed and passed an illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue." This is a serious event that violates the UN Charter and interferes in our internal affairs. All Chinese Buddhist monks and laypersons of all ethnic groups express immense indignation and resolute opposition.

In the past, the million serfs in Tibet suffered immense oppression and exploitation, experiencing profound disasters and living in a "hell on earth." The Tibetan culture and religion had long been trampled and defiled by the evil feudal serf system and imperialist aggressor forces to a heartbreaking degree. Because the armed rebellion launched by a small number of upper-class reactionary elements was quickly quelled, the broad masses of Tibetan monks and laypeople were able to begin to gain human rights and freedom, to carry out democratic reforms step by step, and to escape the fiery hell and move towards a bright and happy paradise. The lama temples were also able to shake off the inherited burden of the feudal serf system and gain an opportunity to cleanse themselves of dirt and see the light of day once again. Under the leadership and care of the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, headed by the Panchen Lama, the Tibetan monks and laypeople are enjoying increasingly beautiful, pure, and perfect cultural and religious lives. The sutras, statues, cultural relics, religious rituals, Buddhist research and practice, and the economic life of the temples have all received full and reasonable protection and assistance. These are undeniable and obvious facts.

The demand for "respect for the basic human rights of the Tibetan people and their unique cultural and religious life" put forward in that shameful resolution manufactured by the United States in the United Nations is a complete reversal of right and wrong and a confusion of black and white. It is a malicious slander against our country on a matter that is purely our internal affair, and also a shameless slander against the Tibetan culture and religion of our country. As an old Tibetan bhikkhu of China, I want to warn the U.S. imperialism and its servant states: Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, and everything in Tibet is our country's internal affair. No country or international organization has any right to interfere. Imperialists, you are terminally ill and in your death throes. Your attempt to prevent the newborn forces of a vigorous socialist China and to revive the corpse of Tibet's feudal serf system is truly an overestimation of your own capabilities. The more tricks you play, the more shameful you will look. The great and just cause that we are carrying out on our own territory cannot be stopped by any of your conspiracies.

All Chinese monks and laypeople of all ethnic groups resolutely support and endorse the solemn statement of our government. Together with the people of the whole country, we will closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government and fight to the end to thoroughly carry out democratic reforms in the Tibetan region and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet!

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 26th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial today stating that China and the Chinese people strongly protested the United Nations' illegal discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue." This is justifiable and reasonable because the United Nations has no right to discuss the "Tibet issue," which is China's internal affair.

The editorial pointed out that up to now, the United Nations is still being used by imperialists to serve their evil purposes. The editorial also said that the clamoring over the so-called "Tibet issue" and the "Sino-Indian border issue" both stem from the same source, namely the conspiracy of imperialists to create international tension. Newspapers here today also published a letter from the Indonesian Peace Committee to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the occasion of the fourteenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The Indonesian Peace Committee criticized the United Nations for refusing to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and for discussing the so-called "Tibet issue," thus interfering in China's internal affairs.

    喜饶嘉措大师痛斥联大非法决议
    帝国主义休想复活西藏农奴制
    印度尼西亚报纸指出联合国无权讨论“西藏问题”
    本报讯　中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉措大师就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话，全文如下：
    联合国大会在美国策划和操纵下，竟然讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，这是严重破坏联合国宪章、干涉我国内政的事件。全中国各族僧俗佛教徒一致表示无比愤慨和坚决反对。
    西藏百万农奴过去备受压迫剥削，灾难深重，过着“人间地狱”的日子。藏族文化和宗教早已被罪恶的封建农奴制度和帝国主义侵略势力践踏沾污到了令人痛心疾首的地步。由于少数上层反动分子所发动的武装叛乱迅速敉平，西藏广大僧俗人民才能够开始获得人权和自由，才能够有步骤地进行民主改革，才能够脱离水深火热的地狱走向光明幸福的天堂，而喇嘛寺庙也由于摆脱了封建农奴制度的因袭重担，才能够获得涤瑕荡垢、重见光明的机会。在中央人民政府和以班禅大师为首的西藏自治区筹委会的领导和关怀下，西藏僧俗人民正享受着日益美好、纯洁和完善的文化生活和宗教生活。喇嘛寺庙的经像文物、宗教仪式，佛教研究和修持，寺庙的经济生活都得到充分的、合理的保护和帮助，这是抹煞不了的、众目共睹的事实。
    美国在联合国里制造出来的那个可耻的决议中所提出的“尊重西藏人民的基本人权和他们的独特的文化和宗教生活”的要求，完全是颠倒是非、混淆黑白，在纯属我国内政问题上对我国进行恶毒诽谤，也是对我国藏族文化和宗教进行无耻诬蔑。作为一个中国藏族老比丘，我要警告美帝国主义及其仆从国家，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏的一切是我国的内政，任何国家和国际组织根本无权干涉。帝国主义者，你们已经病入膏肓，朝不保夕，你们妄想阻止生龙活虎的社会主义中国的新生力量，妄想复活西藏封建农奴制度的僵尸，真是毫不自量。你们玩的花招越多，你们出的丑相就会更多。我们在自己领土上所进行的伟大的、正义的事业是你们任何阴谋活动所阻挡不了的。
    全中国各族僧俗人民坚决拥护和支持我国政府的严正声明，我们和全国人民在一起，紧紧团结在中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，为彻底进行西藏地区的民主改革、建设繁荣幸福的新西藏奋斗到底！
    据新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天发表社论说，中国以及中国人民强烈抗议联合国非法讨论所谓“西藏问题”，这是理所当然的和合理的，因为联合国没有丝毫权利来讨论作为中国内政的“西藏问题”。
    社论指出，到现在为止，联合国仍旧被帝国主义者利用来为它们罪恶的目的服务。社论又说，在所谓“西藏问题”和“中印边界问题”上大肆叫嚷，都是出于同一个根源，即帝国主义者制造国际紧张局势的阴谋。这里的报纸今天也刊登了印度尼西亚和平委员会在联合国组织成立十四周年纪念时给联合国秘书长的信。印度尼西亚和平委员会批评联合国，拒不恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位，还讨论所谓“西藏问题”，干涉中国的内政。
