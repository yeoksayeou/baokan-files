    Great Friendship, Great Solidarity
    Speech at the Celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on October 4th
    Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Dear Guests! Dear Comrades and Friends!

    Today, we are here to joyously celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the National Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and all its members, to extend a warm welcome to the guests attending our celebration, to all comrades of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation headed by Comrade Tikhonov, to all Soviet comrades present, to comrades from all socialist countries, and to friends from other countries!

    We have just jubilantly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The establishment of the People's Republic of China marked the complete victory of the democratic revolution of our people after a long period of struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and the beginning of a new socialist era in China. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant successes on all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our country's industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of culture and science have experienced unprecedented development. Our country has never been as prosperous and strong as it is now. More than fifty different ethnic groups in our country are closely united in the big family of the motherland. At present, based on the great leap forward of last year, our people, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, have launched a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy throughout the country, continuing to leap forward with greater vigor, and striving to complete the main targets of the second five-year plan, originally scheduled for 1962, ahead of schedule and exceeding the target this year.

    The past ten years have also been ten years of great victories for the Chinese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism. As a member of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China has made due contributions to the lofty cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress. The old China, weak and at the mercy of others, is long gone forever. The new China has emerged on the world stage as a strong, independent, and sovereign world power.

    The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution. The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and also the common victory of the international proletariat and the people of the whole world. The close unity and unprecedented strength of the socialist family composed of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries have fundamentally changed the balance of class forces in the international arena. China, which was once a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, has thoroughly overthrown the rule of imperialism and is rapidly changing its poor and backward features. The great victories achieved by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have made all progressive people in the world increasingly attracted to Marxism-Leninism, and have given powerful encouragement to the people of all oppressed nations. They have become more confident in their struggles for national liberation, people's democracy, and a socialist future.

    All our victories at home have relied on the great unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This is the fundamental condition for our victory. In the international arena, our victory has been due to our great unity with the people of the world, which is an indispensable international condition for our victory. Our revolution and construction have received the support of the proletariat of all countries and the people of the world, especially the great Soviet Union, which has consistently given us tremendous and multifaceted assistance. Over the past ten years, according to the agreements between the Chinese and Soviet governments, the Soviet Union has helped our country build a large number of industrial construction units. These major construction projects are the center of our country's industrial construction in the first five-year plan, and they are the backbone force for further strengthening our modern industry. The Soviet people have also extracted a large number of outstanding experts from their own extremely heavy communist construction work to help us. These experts not only possess superb scientific and technological knowledge and rich practical work experience, but also have a high degree of internationalist spirit and selfless work attitude. They regard our socialist construction as their own cause. Here, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to express our most sincere gratitude to the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, to the great Soviet people, and to all Soviet experts who are working or have completed their work and returned to their country.

    In the socialist family, the national economies of our socialist countries are all rising together, and the friendship and unity between our countries are being strengthened more and more. Over the past ten years, the people of our country and the people of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries have maintained and developed the best fraternal relations. The friendship between us is the greatest friendship in human history; the unity between us is the greatest unity in human history. The friendship and unity between socialist countries, especially the friendship and unity between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union, are playing an increasingly important role in the development of human history. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was born immediately after the birth of the People's Republic of China, and its mission is to work tirelessly to maintain and strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the support and assistance of various democratic parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life in our country, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has played an active role in enhancing and consolidating the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, promoting cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, and helping the vast majority of our people learn from the Soviet Union. In our work, we have also received enthusiastic support from the Soviet people, especially the Soviet Union-China Friendship Association, the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Soviet embassy in China who have provided us with regular assistance. Here, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Soviet comrades who have helped us in our work.

    As our people celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, we are very pleased to see that our great ally, the Soviet Union, has entered a new historical period, namely, the period of comprehensively launching the construction of communist society. The Soviet people are victoriously implementing the magnificent seven-year plan and are advancing towards communism, the greatest ideal of mankind. Recently, the Soviet Union successfully launched its second cosmic rocket and accurately reached the surface of the moon. This world-shaking event is a victory for the socialist system, a victory for the cause of peace, and the glory and pride of the entire socialist camp. The people of China and the world all cheered for the great contributions made by the Soviet Union in the cause of researching and conquering the universe. The realization of the Soviet Union's 1959-1965 seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will lay a solid foundation in terms of material and spiritual conditions for the Soviet Union's transition to communism, and will enrich the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism with valuable experience in building communism. The fact that the Soviet Union is carrying out communist construction has extremely important historical significance. When the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced that it was starting to comprehensively build a communist society, the great goals of all socialist countries and all mankind to move forward became clearer.

    We are also very pleased to see that since the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties in 1957, the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made important progress in striving for peace and socialism, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and mutually learning from each other and exchanging experiences in all exchanges. In stark contrast to the situation in the imperialist camp, the close cooperation and unity of the socialist camp are currently presenting an unprecedentedly prosperous scene. The continuous development and consolidation of the socialist camp is of paramount importance in contemporary world politics. It not only vividly demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but also shows that the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have sufficient strength to maintain and defend world peace.

    Our great ally, the Soviet Union, has made a series of efforts to ease international tensions. The Soviet government has proposed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the end of the occupation system in West Berlin, and the convening of a summit conference of great powers, and has made great efforts for this purpose at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, visited the United States, held talks with U.S. President Eisenhower, and had extensive contact with people from all walks of life in the United States. He also put forward new proposals for complete and thorough disarmament on behalf of the Soviet government at the United Nations General Assembly. Comrade Khrushchev's visit will have a positive effect on promoting a further understanding of the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace diplomacy by the broad masses of the American people, on promoting the improvement of Soviet-American relations, and on easing international tensions. These actions taken by the Soviet Union to safeguard world peace have been warmly welcomed and fully supported by our people. Our people also warmly welcomed the cordial talks held between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing. The imperialists and reactionaries fear the unity of socialist countries, especially China and the Soviet Union, most of all. They are trying every despicable method to provoke and undermine our friendship and unity. However, past history has proven, and future facts will continue to prove, that the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union, and the friendly unity of the entire socialist camp, are as solid as a rock and unbreakable. All the divisive conspiracies carried out by the imperialist reactionaries will not produce any other result except to further expose their ugly faces in front of the people of the world.

    As our people across the country jubilantly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we were extremely excited to see that extensive celebrations were held in cities and villages of the Soviet Union, and the great Soviet people regarded this festival as their own. Today, as we gather together with our dear Soviet comrades, I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about a very meaningful thing. The head of the delegation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, the poet Tikhonov, has brought our Chinese people an unusually precious gift this time, which is a golden fist on top of the flag pole used during the Boxer Rebellion. The imperialist Eight-Power Allied Forces bloodily suppressed the Boxer Rebellion, and German officers led by Waldersee brought this fist to Berlin. When the heroic Soviet Red Army liberated Berlin, they brought this fist as a trophy to Moscow, and finally transferred it to Comrade Tikhonov. Comrade Tikhonov has treasured this fist for many years, wrote poems praising it, and believes that this fist should "return to its original owner." We want to thank Comrade Tikhonov here. He brought such a meaningful gift to the Chinese people on our 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. This gift is a symbol of the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Comrades! Friends! Our era is a great era in which mankind is transitioning from capitalism to socialism. The trend of world development is already very clear: the forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of imperialist war, the oppressed nations will surely overthrow the reactionary rule of colonialism, and the socialist system will surely replace the capitalist system. In this great era, the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology has firmly united the people of China and the Soviet Union. Our friendship has withstood all tests. Whether in adversity or in victory, we will always stand together. History will increasingly prove that Sino-Soviet friendship is the strongest fortress for world peace and the cause of human progress.
    Long live the great unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
Long live great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace! (Attached photo)

    伟大的友谊  伟大的团结
    十月四日在庆祝中苏友好协会成立十周年大会上的讲话
    中苏友好协会总会会长　宋庆龄亲爱的来宾们！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    今天，我们在这里欢庆中苏友好协会成立的十周年。首先，请允许我以中苏友好协会总会和中苏友好协会全体会员的名义，向参加我们庆祝大会的来宾们，向以吉洪诺夫同志为首的苏中友好协会代表团的全体同志们，向在座的所有苏联同志和所有社会主义国家的同志们以及其他国家的朋友们表示热烈的欢迎！
    我们刚刚欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了中华人民共和国成立十周年。中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国人民在经过长时期的斗争之后，取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的民主革命的彻底胜利，开始了中国的社会主义新时代。十年以来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上都取得了光辉的成就。我国工农业生产和文化科学各个方面都有了空前的大发展。我们的国家从来没有像现在这样繁荣和昌盛。我国五十多个不同的民族亲密地团结在祖国大家庭中。目前，我国人民正在去年大跃进的基础上，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国范围内掀起了增产节约的新高潮，更加鼓足干劲地继续向前跃进，为在今年内提前和超额完成预定于1962年实现的第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。
    过去的十年，也是中国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争取得伟大胜利的十年。中华人民共和国作为以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的一员，对维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业，作出了应有的贡献。衰弱的、任人宰割的旧中国，早已一去不复返了，新的中国已经作为一个强大的、独立自主的世界大国，出现在世界舞台上。
    中国革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续。中国人民的胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利，也是国际无产阶级和全世界人民的共同胜利。苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家所组成的社会主义大家庭的亲密团结和空前强大，已经根本改变了国际范围内阶级力量的对比。曾经是半殖民地、半封建的中国，已经彻底地推翻了帝国主义的统治，迅速地改变着贫穷和落后的面貌。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家所获得的伟大胜利，使得全世界一切要求进步的人们，愈来愈被马克思列宁主义所吸引，使得一切被压迫民族的人民得到有力的鼓舞，他们在争取民族解放、人民民主和社会主义前途的斗争中，已经有了更加坚强的信心。
    我们的一切胜利的取得，在国内，是依靠了在中国共产党领导下的中国人民的大团结，这是我们取得胜利的根本条件；在国际范围内，是由于我们同全世界人民的大团结，这是我们取得胜利的必不可少的国际条件。我们的革命和建设事业，得到了各国无产阶级和全世界人民的支持，特别是伟大的苏联，一贯地给了我们巨大的、多方面的援助。十年来，根据中苏两国政府的协议，苏联帮助我国建立了大批的工业建设单位。这些重大的建设项目，是我国第一个五年计划工业建设的中心，是进一步增强我国现代化工业的骨干力量。苏联人民还从自己十分繁重的共产主义建设工作中抽出大批优秀的专家来帮助我们。这些专家，不仅具有精湛的科学技术知识和丰富的实际工作经验，而且具有高度的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动态度。他们把我国社会主义建设事业当作他们自己的事业一样看待。在这里，请允许我以中国人民的名义，向光荣的苏联共产党和苏联政府，向伟大的苏联人民，向正在我国工作的或工作期满已经回国的所有苏联专家，表示我们最真诚的感谢。
    在社会主义的大家庭里，我们社会主义各国的国民经济都在共同高涨，我们各国之间的友谊和团结正在愈益增强。十年来，我国人民和苏联人民以及所有社会主义国家的人民保持和发展了最好的兄弟关系。我们之间的友谊，是人类历史上最伟大的友谊；我们之间的团结，是人类历史上最伟大的团结。社会主义国家之间的友谊和团结，特别是中国和苏联两个伟大国家之间的友谊和团结，对于人类历史的发展正在起着越来越重要的作用。中苏友好协会是紧接着中华人民共和国的诞生而诞生的，它的使命就是为维护和加强中苏两国人民之间的友谊和团结而不懈地工作。十年以来，中苏友好协会在中国共产党的领导之下，在我国各民主党派、各社会团体和各界人士的支持和帮助之下，对增进和巩固中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，促进中苏两国的文化交流，帮助我国广大人民学习苏联方面，起了积极的作用。在我们的工作中，同样得到苏联人民的热情支持，特别是苏中友好协会、苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会和苏联驻中国大使馆给了我们经常的协助。在这里，我代表中苏友好协会的全体会员，向帮助我们工作的苏联同志们表示深切的感谢。
    当我国人民欢庆中华人民共和国成立十周年和中苏友好协会成立十周年的时候，我们十分高兴地看到，我们的伟大盟邦苏联已经进入了一个新的历史时期，即全面地开展共产主义社会建设的时期。苏联人民正在胜利地实施宏伟的七年计划，正在向着人类最伟大的理想共产主义前进。最近，苏联成功地发射了第二个宇宙火箭，并且准确地到达月球表面。这一轰动全世界的事件，是社会主义制度的胜利，是和平事业的胜利，是整个社会主义阵营的光荣和骄傲。全中国和全世界的人民都为苏联在研究和征服宇宙的事业中所作出的巨大贡献欢呼。苏联1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划的实现，将在物质条件方面和精神条件方面为苏联过渡到共产主义建立巩固的基础，并且将以建设共产主义的宝贵经验丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库。苏联进行共产主义建设这个事实有着极其重大的历史意义。当苏联共产党宣布着手全面建设共产主义社会的时候，一切社会主义国家以及全人类向前迈进的伟大目标就更加清楚了。
    我们还十分高兴地看到，自从1957年在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党的代表会议以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结，无论在争取和平和社会主义的共同斗争方面，在保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁方面，在一切交往中互相学习、交流经验方面，都有了重要的进展。和帝国主义阵营的情况恰恰相反，目前社会主义阵营各国亲密合作团结一致，呈现出一片空前繁荣的景象。社会主义阵营的不断发展和巩固，在当代的世界政治中具有头等的意义，它不但生动地显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，而且表明了以苏联为首的社会主义各国有着足够的力量可以维护和保卫全世界的和平。
    我们伟大的盟邦苏联为了缓和国际紧张局势，作出了一系列的努力。苏联政府建议缔结对德和约，结束西柏林占领制度，召开大国首脑会议，并且在日内瓦外长会议上为此而作了重大的努力。不久以前，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志又访问了美国，和美国总统艾森豪威尔举行了会谈，和美国各阶层人士进行了广泛的接触，并在联合国大会上代表苏联政府提出了全面彻底裁军的新建议。赫鲁晓夫同志的这次访问，对于促进美国广大人民对苏联一贯奉行的和平外交政策获致进一步的了解，对于促进苏美两国关系的改善，对于缓和国际紧张局势，都会产生良好的作用。苏联为维护世界和平所采取的这些行动，受到了我国人民的热烈欢迎和全力支持。我国人民还热烈地欢迎毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在北京所举行的亲切的会谈。帝国主义和反动派最惧怕社会主义国家特别是中苏两国的团结一致，它们想尽一切卑鄙的方法来挑拨和破坏我们的友谊和团结。然而，过去的历史已经证明，现在和将来的事实还将证明，中苏两国的友好团结，以及整个社会主义阵营的友好团结是坚如磐石，牢不可破的，一切帝国主义反动派所进行的挑拨离间的阴谋，除了在全世界人民面前更加暴露他们的丑恶面孔之外，决不会产生任何其他的结果。
    当我国人民举国一致地欢庆中华人民共和国建国十周年的时候，我们怀着极其兴奋的心情看到，在苏联的城市和乡村中，广泛地进行了庆祝活动，伟大的苏联人民把这个节日当作自己的节日看待。今天，当我们和亲爱的苏联同志们欢聚一堂的时候，我想借用这个机会，告诉大家一件非常有意义的事情。苏中友好协会代表团的团长、诗人吉洪诺夫同志，这次给我们中国人民带来了一件异常珍贵的礼品，这就是义和团起义时所用的大旗杆上面的一个金色拳头。帝国主义的八国联军血腥地镇压了义和团的起义，瓦德西率领下的德国军官，把这个拳头带到了柏林。当英勇的苏联红军解放柏林时，就把这个拳头作为战利品带到了莫斯科，最后转送给吉洪诺夫同志。吉洪诺夫同志多年来珍藏着这个拳头，写过歌颂它的诗篇，并且认为这个拳头应该“物归原主”。我们要在这里感谢吉洪诺夫同志，他在我们建国十周年的时候，给中国人民带来了这样有意义的一件礼品，这件礼品是中苏两国人民的牢不可破的伟大友谊的象征。
    同志们！朋友们！我们的时代，是人类从资本主义过渡到社会主义的伟大时代。世界发展的趋势已经十分明显，和平力量必将战胜帝国主义战争势力，被压迫民族必将推翻殖民主义反动统治，社会主义制度必将代替资本主义制度。在这个伟大的时代中，战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，把中苏两国人民牢牢地结合在一起。我们的友谊经受了一切的考验，不论是在患难中或是在胜利中，我们永远站在一起。历史将日益证明中苏友谊是世界和平和人类进步事业的最坚强的堡垒。
    中苏两国人民的伟大的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
