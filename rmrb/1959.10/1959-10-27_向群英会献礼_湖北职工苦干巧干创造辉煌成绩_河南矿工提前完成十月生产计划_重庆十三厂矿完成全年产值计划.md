Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 25th: Hundreds of thousands of workers in Hubei Province have achieved brilliant results through hard work and ingenuity to dedicate to the National Conference of Heroes. The total industrial output value in mid-October increased by 14.35% compared to the first ten days of the month, 10.63% compared to late September, and 31.5% compared to mid-September. The output of major products also increased rapidly.

Since entering October, the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation have been competing with each other, causing pig iron production to rise steadily. The output in mid-October increased by 5% compared to the first ten days of the month. On the steelmaking front, indigenous and foreign methods were combined, and large and small open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces advanced side by side, causing steel output in mid-October to surge by 59.7% compared to the first ten days of the month.

Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee, Daye Steel Plant focused on "five firsts" (i.e., the first ten days of the month, the first day of the ten days, the first shift of the day, the first four hours of the shift, and the first operator of the shift). The plant reported successive victories in the first and middle ten days of October, with steel, iron, and steel products completing 101.2%, 103.4%, and 106.7% of the plan, respectively.

The small blast furnace production in the province's local enterprise system also achieved outstanding results, with pig iron production in the first and middle ten days of October exceeding the plan by 11%. It is estimated that the entire month can increase pig iron production by 1,900 tons.

Light industry, chemical industry, and other systems in the province also reported good news one after another. The output of products such as soap, cement, cotton cloth, machine-made paper, and matches all increased significantly in mid-October compared to the first ten days of the month.

The victory in the first and middle ten days of October changed the situation of being "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" of each month's production. This achievement is the result of the widespread education on socialism and the General Line among workers since the beginning of this month, as well as the widespread and in-depth campaign to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. Now, the workers on the province's industrial front are advancing victoriously, pushing the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution to a new peak, and striving to overfulfill the annual state plan ahead of schedule!

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 25th: The coal mine workers in Henan Province, holding high the red flag of the large-scale high-yield competition, completed the state's October raw coal production plan ahead of schedule by 3.78% ten days in advance, to greet the National Conference of Heroes. From the 1st to the 21st, the average daily output of raw coal in the province increased by 17.87% compared to the average daily output in September.

The characteristic of coal industry production in Henan Province in October is that it has completely reversed the "large slack and large tension" situation in previous production, and coal production has been continuously rising. The output of small coal kilns in various places has also been continuously improved. This month, various coal mines continued to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and launched a more enthusiastic large-scale high-yield red flag competition. According to the statistics of six mining bureaus, 2,390 groups, with approximately 56,000 people, participated in the competition, accounting for 89% of the total number of employees. Many units also carried out opponent competitions, three-assistance competitions, and linking competitions to strengthen the unity of the three shifts and greatly improve the output. For example, after Hou Changxi's tunneling group in Yangjiazhuang Mine of Hebi Mining Bureau passed on the experience of deep-hole blasting to Wang Kangxi's group, the tunneling efficiency of Wang Kangxi's group increased from about two meters to more than five meters. Wang Kangxi's group then helped Wang Yangsheng's group to learn this experience, enabling Wang Yangsheng's group to create a new record of 8.1 meters.

Leading cadres of various mining bureaus continued to go deep into the front line to solve outstanding problems fiercely. After the leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau followed the shifts down the well, they changed the coal chute transportation of Jiaoxi Mine to hydraulic transportation, which increased the efficiency by six times. The daily output increased from 700 tons to 1,000 tons, and reached more than 1,500 tons on the 17th, creating the highest record this year. Various mining bureaus also vigorously promoted more than 30 kinds of advanced experiences such as four-shift cross-operation, combine coal mining, deep-hole blasting, fast trough shifting, and multi-pull fast running.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 25th: On the eve of the opening of the National Conference of Heroes, thirteen factories and mines in Chongqing, including Chongqing Tire Factory, Luzhou Chemical Plant, and Changjiang Chemical Plant, completed this year's total output value plan ahead of schedule. Among them, five enterprises and units, including Chongqing Tire Factory, comprehensively overfulfilled various indicators in the national plan.

Many employees of these factories and mines were determined to complete the annual plan within October to dedicate to the National Conference of Heroes. Based on the specific conditions of their factory, workshop, and group, they universally carried out opponent competitions, vigorously engaged in technological innovation, and vigorously promoted advanced experiences. 90% of the employees of Luzhou Chemical Plant participated in the opponent competition. In September, the plant promoted more than 200 advanced experiences and realized more than 400 innovation proposals. The total output value plan increased by 44.6% compared to July and 39% compared to August. Since Changjiang Chemical Plant launched the opponent competition in August, it has been creating new records every day. The three shifts of the distillation process in the stearin glue workshop competed with each other, so that the output quickly increased from an average of 800 kilograms per shift to more than 1,000 kilograms, with the highest reaching 1,242 kilograms.

These thirteen factories and mines resolutely implemented the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee to "grasp tightly from the beginning and grasp tightly from beginning to end" from the beginning of this year, striving to achieve high output, high quality, high work efficiency, low cost, and safe production, and to achieve a comprehensive leap forward. Chongqing Tire Factory maintained a high-yield situation from January to June, and production increased dramatically after August. The monthly tire output increased more than five times compared to January and February, 50% compared to August in September, and 27% compared to the total monthly output in September in the first twenty-three days of October. The product varieties also increased from four in the first quarter of this year to thirteen. The annual cost was reduced by 7% compared to the plan, and the quality also reached the national standard.
