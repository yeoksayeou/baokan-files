Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: More than six thousand representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts have converged in Beijing. They are arriving fully loaded with the abundant fruits of the Great Leap Forward to attend this grand assembly of heroes, and will also bring back more experience and greater enthusiasm to all regions, promoting the new high tide of production to continue to develop in a deeper and more sustained direction.

As of the 24th, 6,576 representatives participating in the conference had arrived in Beijing. Among them, 2,540 were representatives of advanced collectives, 3,284 were representatives of advanced producers, and 752 were specially invited representatives.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, heroes have emerged and pacesetters have sprung up on our country's industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts. In the first half of 1959 alone, more than 286,000 advanced collectives and more than 3.6 million advanced producers emerged nationwide. The representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers attending this National Congress of Heroes are selected from this strong contingent of advanced producers.

The representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers attending this Congress of Heroes come from twenty-six industrial sectors including metallurgy, machinery, coal, water conservancy and electric power, chemical industry, petroleum, textiles, light industry (including handicrafts), forestry, agricultural reclamation, construction, geology, railways, postal and telecommunications, highways, civil aviation, meteorology, surveying and mapping, seamen, commerce, finance, grain, banking, aquatic products, foreign trade, and municipal public utilities. The specially invited representatives come from all walks of life including the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Railway Corps, the People's Communes, education, literature and art, health, science and technology, as well as from government agencies, mass organizations, employees' families, and private practitioners. The representatives include twenty-three ethnic groups such as Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Buyi, and Korean. Among them are old heroes over seventy years old, and young models as young as sixteen. There are 796 female representatives, accounting for 12.11% of the total number of representatives.

The representatives attending this Congress of Heroes are all glorious fighters who defend the Party's general line for socialist construction and vanguards of socialist construction. From them, we can see the great achievements of implementing the general line on our country's industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts. After the implementation of the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, a situation of blooming large, medium, and small enterprises has emerged on our country's industrial front. The representatives attending this meeting include not only representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from modern large-scale enterprises, but also representatives from more medium- and small-scale advanced enterprises that were launched using indigenous methods, as well as representatives from units with outstanding achievements in running industries in the People's Communes. In transportation, there are not only representatives from modern railway, highway, and shipping enterprises, but also representatives from units with significant achievements in building indigenous railways and running transportation by communes. For example, among the representatives from Shandong Province attending this meeting, there are more than thirty representatives from medium- and small-scale metallurgical enterprises, including representatives from advanced collectives such as the Iron Smelting Experimental Plant of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, the Steelmaking Section of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory, and the Third Workshop of the Red Flag No. 2 Coking Oven of the Yanzhou Coking Plant, as well as the female furnace chief of the March 8th Women's Furnace of the Yidu No. 1 Steel Plant. These advanced collectives and advanced producers emerged during the mass movement of large-scale steelmaking last year. It was under the leadership of the Party that they led the masses, enabling Shandong Province, which originally had no steel industry foundation, to possess a considerably high steel and iron production capacity within a short year.

After the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued Great Leap Forward this year, the industry in our country's inland and ethnic minority regions has greatly developed. There are 273 representatives of ethnic minorities attending this meeting, an increase of 36% compared with the representatives attending the National Congress of Advanced Producers in 1956. The number of representatives from ethnic minority regions such as Qinghai, Ningxia, Guizhou, and Guangxi has greatly increased compared to the past, and many of them are representatives from newly built steel plants, farm tool factories, and woolen mills in these regions.

The representatives attending this Congress not only reflect the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production in our country, but their advanced deeds also reflect the changes in the ideological outlook of the working class in our country and the high development of communist spirit. Among them are Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui, workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, Xu Xuehui, an accountant of the Longchuan Branch of the People's Bank of Yunnan Province, Chen Wendi, a worker of the Qingshan Thermal Power Plant in Wuhan, and Tao Demei, deputy director of the Boiler Branch of the Huainan Power Plant in Anhui, who are wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of the Party and the people and disregard their own lives for the collective interest; Xu Maofa, a foreman of the Shanghai No. 1 United Electric Equipment Factory, Wu Lianghu, a worker of the Wuhan Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant, and Zhao Mengtao, a fine yarn worker of the Xi'an No. 5 State-owned Cotton Mill in Shaanxi, who have a lofty communist spirit and wholeheartedly help backward units catch up with advanced levels; Wang Fengen, Zhang Baifa, Su Guangming, and Xu Chenglong, who are technical innovation experts who break superstitions, dare to think and dare to act, and are indomitable in carrying out inventions and innovations; and Meng Tai, Zhan Shuijing, Guo Fupeng, and Kang Jiakun, veteran heroes who have a high sense of responsibility as masters of the working class and have served the people wholeheartedly for ten years as if it were a single day.

Among the representatives attending the Congress, there are also advanced figures such as geological prospecting workers, petroleum drilling workers, and truck drivers who have achieved outstanding results under extremely difficult conditions, and a large number of salespersons, purchasers, warehouse keepers, rural postmen, service personnel, cleaners, cooks, and childcare workers who have consistently worked diligently to serve the people and have created outstanding achievements in ordinary positions. Today, they have also gloriously come to the capital to report their achievements to the Party and Chairman Mao.

After arriving in Beijing, the representatives received a warm welcome from the people of the capital and various central units. Some representatives also took advantage of the time before the meeting to exchange experiences with representatives from the same industry, and some visited the magnificent buildings of the capital. They will participate in the grand Congress of Heroes starting on the 26th.

    新华社24日讯　六千多名来自工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上的先进集体和先进生产者代表，已经会师北京。他们满载着大跃进的丰收硕果来出席这次规模盛大的群英大会，同时也将把更多的经验，更大的干劲带回各地，推动新的生产高潮继续向更深入、更持久的方向发展。
    截至24日，参加大会的代表已经有六千五百七十六人到达北京。其中先进集体代表二千五百四十人，先进生产者代表三千二百八十四人，特邀代表七百五十二人。
    自从1958年大跃进以来，我国工业、交通、基建、财贸战线上英雄辈出，标兵林立，仅1959年上半年全国就涌现出先进集体二十八万六千多个，先进生产者三百六十多万人；出席这次全国群英大会的先进集体和先进生产者代表，就是在这支强大的先进生产者队伍中评选出来的。
    出席这次群英会的先进集体代表和先进生产者，来自冶金，机械，煤炭，水利电力，化工，石油，纺织，轻工（包括手工业），林业，农垦，建筑，地质，铁道，邮电，公路，民用航空，气象，测绘，海员，商业，财政，粮食，银行，水产，对外贸易和市政公用事业等二十六个产业部门；特邀代表来自中国人民解放军总后勤部、铁道兵团、人民公社、教育、文艺、卫生、科学技术各界，以及机关团体、职工家属和私方从业人员中。代表中包括汉、蒙古、回、藏、维吾尔、苗、彝、僮、布依、朝鲜等二十三个民族。其中有七十多岁高龄的老英雄，也有十六岁的小模范。女代表七百九十六人，占代表总数的12.11％。
    出席这次群英大会的代表，都是捍卫党的社会主义建设总路线的光荣战士和社会主义建设的急先锋，从他们身上可以看到我国工业、交通、基建、财贸战线上执行总路线的伟大成果。党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针贯彻以后，使我国工业战线上出现了大、中、小企业遍地开花的局面；出席这次会议的代表，不仅有现代化大型企业的先进集体代表和先进生产者，而且有更多的用土法上马的中、小型先进企业的代表，还有人民公社办工业有突出成就的单位的代表。在交通方面，不仅有现代化铁路、公路、航运企业的代表，也有兴建土铁路和公社办交通有显著成就的单位。如山东省出席这次会议的代表中，就有三十多位中、小型冶金企业的代表，这里包括中共山东省委和省人民委员会炼铁试验厂、青岛自行车厂炼钢工段、兖州焦化厂红旗二号焦炉三车间等先进集体的代表，以及益都第一钢铁厂三八妇女炉的女炉长等。这些先进集体和先进生产者，都是在去年大炼钢铁的群众运动中涌现出来的，是他们在党的领导下带动群众，使原来毫无钢铁工业基础的山东省，在短短一年内具备了相当高的钢、铁生产能力。
    经过去年的大跃进和今年的继续大跃进，我国内地和少数民族地区的工业有了很大的发展，出席这次会议的少数民族代表有二百七十三人，比1956年出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表增加了36％。青海、宁夏、贵州、广西等少数民族地区的代表人数都比以往大大增加，其中有不少是这些地区新建的钢铁厂、农具厂和毛纺厂的代表。
    出席这次大会的代表，不仅反映了我国工业生产大跃进的伟大胜利，而且他们的先进事迹也反映了我国工人阶级思想面貌的变化和共产主义风格的高度发扬。他们中间有对党和人民的事业赤胆忠心，为了集体利益不顾自己生命危险的鞍钢第一炼钢厂工人陈效法和李绍奎、人民银行云南省陇川支行会计徐学惠、武汉市青山热电站工人陈文第、安徽淮南发电厂锅炉分场副主任陶德美等；有具有崇高的共产主义风格，满腔热情地帮助落后单位赶上先进水平的上海一联电工器材厂工长徐茂发、武汉江岸车辆厂工人吴良湖、陕西西安国棉五厂细纱工赵梦桃等；有破除迷信、敢想敢干、百折不挠进行发明创造的技术革新能手王凤恩、张百发、苏广铭、徐呈龙等；还有具有高度工人阶级主人翁责任感，十年如一日，全心全意为人民服务的老英雄孟泰、詹水晶、郭福鹏、康家坤等。
    在参加大会的代表中，还有在环境十分艰苦的条件下获得出色成就的地质钻探工人、石油钻井工人、汽车驾驶员等先进人物，和一大批一贯勤勤恳恳为人民服务、在平凡的岗位上创造了出色成绩的营业员、采购员、保管员、乡邮员、服务员、清洁工、炊事员、保育员等，他们今天也都光荣地来到首都向党、向毛主席汇报自己的成就。
    代表们到达北京以后，受到首都人民和中央各单位的热情接待，有的代表还利用会前时间，找同行业的代表交流经验，有的参观了首都的雄伟建筑。他们将从26日开始参加规模盛大的群英大会。
