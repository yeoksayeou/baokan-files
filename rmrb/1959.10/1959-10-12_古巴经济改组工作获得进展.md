    据新华社哈瓦那9日电　目前正在举行的古巴土地改革全国委员会会议上所提出的报告表明，随着土地改革的推行，改组古巴经济以发展多种经营、改变帝国主义所造成的蔗糖单一生产状况的工作正在获得进展。
    属于比那尔德里奥省的“农业开发区”的报告指出，这个农业区的二十个合作社共种植了谷类、玉米、豆类、烟草、丝兰等二十三种不同的作物，饲养了牛和猪，还经营了乳类和蛋类的生产。此外还种植了果树。在这一农业区从事耕作的共有一百零三台拖拉机。在卡马圭省，目前有三万卡瓦耶里亚用于畜牧业，十一万七千卡瓦耶里亚种植饲料。三年以后，这个省将有三千卡瓦耶里亚种植稻米，以供应国内消费。
    古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚8日晚在电视演说中谈到国家的经济发展时说，古巴目前已经建立了两个用蔗渣造纸的工厂，两厂共有六百八十四名工人。其中一个厂生产新闻用纸，今年年底就可以满足本国消费的需要。博尼利亚还谈到，一个能生产一百二十吨氮肥的工厂、两个灯泡厂和铜管厂、砖瓦厂、医疗卫生用品厂也已建成。他指出，这是古巴政府力图使自己能生产现在进口的物资的政策的最初步骤。
