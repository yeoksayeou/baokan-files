    U.S. Court Again Unreasonably Refuses Foster Permission to Go Abroad for Medical Treatment
    New York Dispatch: On the 21st, the U.S. Court of Appeals again unreasonably rejected the application of William Z. Foster, honorary chairman of the American Communist Party, to go to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia for medical treatment.
    In 1948, the U.S. authorities unreasonably interrogated the leaders of the American Communist Party. At that time, Foster suffered from severe heart disease and was exempted from interrogation, but was released on bail with a $5,000 security deposit. Since then, Foster has been prohibited from leaving the New York area. Suffering from a serious illness, Foster applied to go to the Soviet Union for medical treatment because the cost of medical treatment in the United States was too high, but this has been unreasonably rejected by the U.S. authorities.

    Afghan Women Begin to Remove Veils
      and Participate in Social Activities
    Kabul Dispatch: Women in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, are beginning to take off their veils and participate in various professional and social activities. The first group of female intellectuals are working in the government and various companies. Previously, all women wore veils in public places. Now they can go to the streets without veils. Previously, women could not participate in social activities with men. Now they can do so freely. Female students are also beginning to take off their veils. Recently, Pakistani newspapers launched a slander campaign with ulterior motives against Afghan women taking off their veils. This has aroused great indignation among the Afghan people.

    U.S. Cost of Living Rises Again
    Washington Dispatch: The U.S. Department of Labor announced on the 23rd that the U.S. cost of living rose to an unprecedented peak in September. The index for this month is 125.2, which is 25.2% higher than the 1947-1949 level. In addition to transportation costs, food prices, rents, and medical expenses have all risen across the board.

    美法院再次无理拒绝福斯特出国医病
    纽约讯　美国上诉法院21日再次无理拒绝美国共产党名誉主席福斯特去苏联和捷克斯洛伐克就医的申请。
    1948年，美国当局对美国共产党领导人无理进行审讯，当时福斯特患有严重的心脏病，始免于审讯，而以五千美元保证金保释出狱。此后，福斯特一直被禁止离开纽约地区。患有重病的福斯特因为在美国医病费用太大，申请去苏联医病，但是一直被美国当局无理拒绝。
    阿富汗妇女开始摘掉面纱
      参加社会活动
    喀布尔讯　阿富汗首都喀布尔的妇女正在开始取下她们的面纱和参加各种职业和社会活动。第一批妇女知识分子正在政府和各公司中工作。以前所有的妇女在公共场所都带面纱。现在她们可以不带面纱到街上来，以前妇女不能同男人一起参加社会活动。现在她们可以自由地这样做了。女学生也开始取下她们的面纱。最近巴基斯坦报纸别有用心地发动一个诽谤运动，反对阿富汗妇女取掉面纱。这引起阿富汗人民的极大的愤慨。
