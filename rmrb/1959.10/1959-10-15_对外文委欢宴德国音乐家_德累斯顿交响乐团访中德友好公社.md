Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Dresden Symphony Orchestra of the German Democratic Republic visited the Dongba Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of the capital today. They performed a quintet of six trumpets and trombones in the square for the commune members, receiving a warm welcome from more than a thousand commune members and school teachers and students. The commune's amateur cultural troupe also played tunes such as "Socialism is Good," "The People's Commune is Good," and the German "Blue Flag Song" using Chinese folk instruments, arousing great interest and appreciation from the German musicians. All members of the Symphony Orchestra visited the commune's school, hospital, cultural center, kindergarten, special handicraft integrated processing factory, agricultural machinery comprehensive repair factory, and agricultural product processing factory.

Tonight, the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a reception to entertain more than a hundred musicians from the Dresden Symphony Orchestra. Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Foreign Cultural Commission, spoke at the beginning of the reception, extending a warm welcome and congratulations to the Dresden Symphony Orchestra for their long journey to China to visit and perform during our country's celebration of its tenth anniversary, and for the great success they achieved in their performances in Beijing. Zhang Zhixiang said: "The Dresden Symphony Orchestra enjoys a high reputation at home and abroad and has long been admired by our country's artistic circles and music lovers. Now, the audience in our capital has personally heard your excellent performances, and the unanimous response is that they have received supreme satisfaction. What is particularly gratifying is that the musicians of China and Germany have successfully collaborated on performances with the works of Germany's greatest musician Beethoven’s “Ninth Symphony”, a theme of joy, freedom and struggle. It can be fully expected that the Symphony Orchestra's visit and performances in other cities in our country will be as successful as in Beijing."

At the reception, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to toast the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people and the increasing strengthening of cultural cooperation.

    新华社14日讯　德意志民主共和国德累斯顿交响乐团今天去首都郊区东坝中德友好人民公社参观访问，并在广场上为社员演出了六个小号、长号五重奏节目，受到一千多公社社员和学校师生的热烈欢迎。公社的业余文工团也用中国民间乐器吹奏了“社会主义好”、“人民公社好”和德国“蓝旗歌”等曲子，引起德国音乐家们极大的兴趣和赞赏。交响乐团全体人员在公社参观了学校、医院、文化馆、幼儿园、特种手工艺综合加工厂、农械综合修造厂和农产品加工厂等地方。
    今晚，对外文化联络委员会举行酒会招待了德累斯顿交响乐团的一百多位音乐家。对外文委副主任张致祥在酒会开始时讲了话，对德累斯顿交响乐团在我国庆祝建国十周年期间远道来我国访问演出，以及在北京演出取得的很大成功，表示热烈的欢迎和祝贺。张致祥说：“德累斯顿交响乐团在国内外负有盛名，久已为我国艺术界和音乐爱好者所景仰，现在我国首都的听众亲自听到了你们卓越的演奏，大家一致的反映是得到了无上的满足。特别使人高兴的是：中德两国的音乐家曾经成功地合作演出了以欢乐、自由、斗争为主题的德国最伟大的音乐家贝多芬的作品“第九交响乐”。完全可以预期，交响乐团在我国其他城市的访问演出将像北京一样获得很大的成功。
    德意志民主共和国驻我国大使汪戴尔应邀出席了今天的招待会。他在讲话中追溯了中德两国关系的历史和深厚的友谊。他说，现在我们应该把两国人民之间的伟大友谊当作爱护眼珠一样来爱护。德累斯顿交响乐团团长波恩格兹教授也在会上作了热情的讲话。他说，乐团全体人员来中国从下飞机起一直到今天去访问参观人民公社，所得到的印象将永不会忘记。他热情地祝贺中国各方面的建设继续繁荣发展。招待会上，宾主一再举杯为中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊和文化合作的日益加强干杯。张致祥在会上还代表对外文委将“中国画册”和建国十周年纪念章等礼品赠给德累斯顿交响乐团的音乐家们。
