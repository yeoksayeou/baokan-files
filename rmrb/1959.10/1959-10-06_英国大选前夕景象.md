Scenes from the Eve of the British General Election
By Pan Fei, Our Correspondent

    Take off your coats and join in
    The British election campaign has entered its climax…
    "Take off your coats and join in..." The Conservative Party Chairman Hailsham issued a call to the entire party on the evening of the 27th. At the same time, Labour Deputy Leader Phillips also shouted to his members: "We are at the beginning of the final decisive stage!"
    Candidate registration closed on the 28th. This time there are a total of one thousand five hundred and twenty-two candidates. Six hundred and twenty-five belong to the Conservative Party, and six hundred and twenty-one belong to the Labour Party. They account for 82% of the total number of candidates. From this figure, it can be seen that the Conservative Party and the Labour Party are playing the main roles in this election contest.
    Macmillan is traveling around the country, giving flying speeches. The British Prime Minister plans to deliver eighty speeches in eleven days. Labour leader Gaitskell is not to be outdone. On the 24th alone, he traveled non-stop for two hundred miles, giving seven speeches. Tens of millions of leaflets were poured into every corner. Large advertisements saying "Vote for me" were plastered all over the main roads. Candidates visited voters in their constituencies door-to-door, asking voters to give them new trust, giving them "the opportunity to serve." Cars equipped with loudspeakers cruised the streets and alleys, shouting all the way. Television and radio broadcast special election programs every day. All newspapers devoted a lot of space to election propaganda.
    Tactics and Platforms
    British newspapers publish election polls almost every day. "The Conservative Party leads by seven and a half percent," "The Conservative Party drops three points," "The Labour Party is catching up rapidly"... These have become headline news that overwhelm everything else. The accuracy of these polls is questionable, but the fierce struggle between the two parties is indeed becoming increasingly heated.
    The Labour Party proposed that if it came to power, it would increase pensions by ten shillings a week and abolish the rent law.... This is obviously easy to impress people. Therefore, in the second week of the campaign, the Conservative Party concentrated its firepower on attacking the Labour Party's pension plan, accusing it of being demagogic; accusing it of being an empty check, and of causing inflation. Macmillan, on the other hand, is praised as a model of flexible tactics. For example, when he went to Manchester, he expressed deep sympathy for the textile industry in the area, which was in a slump, and was willing to take responsibility for solving their difficulties. When he arrived in the Birmingham heavy industrial area, he warned people that if the Labour Party came to power, the policy of "nationalization" would be detrimental to them.
    It would be wrong to think that the fierce struggle between the two parties is due to differences in political views. In fact, apart from individual concrete issues such as pensions and rent laws, there are no major differences in the programs of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. The Conservative Party's election program declares: "We are absolutely opposed to any expansion of nationalization, no matter what means it uses"; the Labour Party says that except for the "nationalization" of steel and long-distance road transport, "we have no other nationalization plans." Both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party advocate "labor-management cooperation" to resolve industrial disputes. The former's program says: "We intend to invite employers and trade unions to send representatives to consider human and industrial issues with us"; the latter claims: "With the assistance of employers and trade unions, we should be able to formulate a management plan." to resolve labor-management disputes. The Conservative Party claims that it will give strong assistance to some industries in difficult situations. The Labour Party emphasizes: "Our policy will aim to assist industry to implement mechanization, modernization and expansion, so as to make the greatest contribution to exports."
    Whether it is the Conservative Party or the Labour Party, they did not originally intend to make a big deal out of international issues. But the situation is pressing. The strong emotions of the British people against nuclear weapons testing and the widespread impact of the Soviet disarmament proposals in Britain have made foreign policy an important position in the election campaign. Therefore, in addition to declaring that they will continue to strengthen the North Atlantic military bloc and consolidate the "Western alliance," the Conservative Party and the Labour Party cannot but separately express their hope to improve East-West relations and hope to reach an agreement on disarmament and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing as soon as possible. (The Labour Party also proposed that if it came to power, it would stop nuclear weapons testing. This should be said to be of positive significance.) Both Macmillan and Gaitskell explained to voters: It was he who opened up the deadlock in East-West relations; it was he who was most qualified to attend the summit conference of great powers.
    There are a total of six hundred and thirty constituencies in the UK, and each constituency produces one member of parliament, that is, the candidate with the most votes is elected. Among the six hundred constituencies, four hundred and twenty-five are called "safe seats"—the Conservative Party controls two hundred and thirty-three, and the Labour Party controls one hundred and eighty. In such constituencies, they control a relatively large number of votes, and the candidates can be elected with certainty. The other two hundred and five constituencies are called "marginal seats." Here, the distribution of votes is relatively balanced, and the candidates of the two parties are often evenly matched. Often only a few thousand or even hundreds of votes will change the situation, and the outcome will be easy to change. Therefore, the struggle for "marginal seats" is particularly fierce.
    North Kensington is one of London's "marginal seats." The Liberal Party's election office in the district was smashed with stones, and its candidate received threatening letters demanding that he withdraw from the election. In Hampstead, the Labour candidate constantly received calls: if he did not withdraw from the election, his family "would die."
    How to win over the mobile voters (that is, those who do not vote for a certain political party) has become the key issue in the competition for "marginal seats." The Conservative Party and the Labour Party are preparing a large number of cars to pick up people everywhere on the day of the vote and send them to the polling stations. Since these people are "mobile," of course whoever's car they sit in will vote for that party.
    Discrimination against the Communist Party
    In this election, the British Communist Party is participating in the election in eighteen constituencies. They held high a clear banner and put forward a program representing the interests of the British people.
    The British electoral system is extremely undemocratic. In theory, every citizen over the age of twenty-one can be a candidate as long as ten people nominate him. But in reality, no ordinary citizen can get such an opportunity. As a candidate, you must pay a deposit of one hundred and fifty pounds, which is roughly equal to two months' income of an ordinary worker. If you do not get one-eighth of the vote, the deposit will be forfeited. Secondly, candidates only need to be elected by a simple majority. If there are three or four candidates in a certain constituency, if the votes are dispersed, someone can be elected with only one-third of the votes, and the votes of other candidates are all invalidated.
    This electoral system is conducive to the Conservative Party and the Labour Party to control constituencies and compete for parliamentary seats, which is very unfavorable to some small parties. Therefore, even bourgeois parties like the Liberal Party openly attack the monopoly of the two major parties on the election campaign.
    For the British Communist Party, the situation is even more different. It was deprived of the right to broadcast on the BBC because its candidates were less than fifty. On Scottish television, the British Communist Party's candidates only got sixty seconds to "explain" their election platform.
    However, the truth cannot be stifled. The influence of the British Communist Party cannot be measured by the number of votes it receives. A few years ago, only the British Communist Party advocated holding a top-level meeting to ease the international situation. And now, the leaders of the two major parties are all touting themselves: He is the best representative to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

### 英国大选前夕景象

    英国大选前夕景象
    本报记者　潘非
    脱下你们的外衣
    英国的竞选运动已经进入了高潮……
    “脱下你们的外衣参加进来……”，保守党的主席黑尔什姆在27日晚上向全党发出了号召。在同一时刻，工党副领袖菲利普斯也向他的党员大声的呼：“我们正处在最后的决定性阶段的开端！”
    候选人的登记已在28日截止。这次一共有一千五百二十二名。其中六百二十五名属于保守党，六百二十一名属于工党。它们占候选人总数的82％。从这一数字可以看出，在这次竞选角斗中，扮演主要角色的是保守党和工党。
    麦克米伦正周游全国，作飞行演说。英国首相打算在十一天中讲演八十次。工党领袖盖茨克尔也不甘落后，仅在24日这一天，就马不停蹄地奔波了二百英里，作了七次演讲。几千万份宣传品倾泻到每一个角落。“投我一票”的大幅广告，布满了通衢要道。候选人在自己的选区中挨户拜访，要求选民给予新的信任，给以为他们“服务的机会”。装有扩音器的汽车，一路叫喊着巡行大街小巷。电视、广播每天在放送着大选特别节目。所有的报纸都以大量篇幅投入了竞选宣传。
    战术和政纲
    英国报纸几乎每天都公布着有关大选的民意测验。“保守党以百分之七又二分之一领先”“保守党下降三点”“工党急起直追”……成为压倒一切的头条消息。这种民意测验的准确性是值得怀疑的，但两党之间的激烈斗争，的确愈加白热化了。
    工党提出，如果它上台执政，将每周增加十个先令的养老金，将废除房租法案……。这显然很容易打动人心。因此，在竞选运动进入第二周的时候，保守党就集中火力攻击工党的养老金计划，斥责它蛊惑人心；斥责它是空头支票，它是引起通货膨胀。而麦克米伦则被誉为策略灵活的典范。例如，他到曼彻斯特，就对这一地区处于萧条中的纺织业深表同情，并且愿意负起解决它们困难的责任。到了伯明翰重工业区，他就警告人们，如果工党上台，“国有化”的政策将对他们不利。
    如果以为两党之间的激烈斗争，是因为政见的不同，那就错了。事实上，除了像养老金、房租法案等个别的具体问题以外，保守党和工党的纲领，并没有重大的差别。保守党的竞选纲领宣称：“我们绝对反对国有化的任何扩大，不管它用的是何种手段”；工党则说，除对钢铁和长途公路运输实行“国有化”以外，“我们没有其他的国有化计划。”保守党和工党，都鼓吹由“劳资合作”来解决工业纠纷。前者的纲领中说：“我们打算邀请雇主和工会派出代表，同我们一道考虑人类和工业的问题”；后者则声称：“在雇主和工会协助下，我们应能制订出一个管理方案来。”以此来解决劳资纷争。保守党声称将对一些处于困难境地的工业，给以大力帮助。工党则着重解释：“我们的政策将旨在协助工业实行机械化、现代化和扩充，使能对出口作出最大的贡献。”
    不论是保守党也好，工党也好，原来都并不打算在国际问题上大做文章。但是形势逼人。英国人民反对核武器试验的强烈情绪，苏联裁军建议在英国引起的广泛影响，使外交政策在竞选运动中占有了重要地位。因此，保守党和工党除了宣称要继续加强北大西洋军事集团和巩固“西方联盟”以外，都不能不分别表示希望改善东西方关系，希望早日就裁军和停止核武器试验问题达成协议。（工党还提出，如果它上台执政，将停止核武器试验。这应该说是有积极意义的。）麦克米伦和盖茨克尔都向选民解释：是他，打开了东西方关系的僵局；是他，最有资格去出席大国首脑会议。
    英国共有六百三十个选区，每个选区产生一名议员，即得票最多的候选人当选。在六百多个选区中，有四百二十五个叫做“安全区”——保守党掌握着二百三十三个，工党掌握着一百八十个。在这种选区内，它们分别控制着比较多数的选票，候选人十拿九稳地可以当选。另外二百零五个选区，叫做“边缘区”。在这里，选票分配比较平衡，两党候选人常常势均力敌。往往只有几千票甚至几百票之差，就会改变形势，胜负易局。因此，争夺“边缘区”的斗争，分外激烈。
    北肯辛敦区，是伦敦的“边缘区”之一。该区自由党的选举办公室，被人用石头砸烂，它的候选人收到了要他退出竞选的恐吓信。在汉姆斯台德，工党的候选人不断接到电话：如果他不退出竞选，一家人“都会命归黄泉”。
    怎样把流动性的选民（即不固定投某一政党的票的）争取到自己方面来，成为争夺“边缘区”的关键问题。保守党和工党都在准备大批汽车，以便在投票那天到处去装人，把他们送到投票站。这些人既然是“流动”的，当然坐谁的汽车就投谁的票。
    对共产党的歧视
    在这次大选中，英共在十八个选区参加竞选。他们高举起鲜明的旗帜，提出了代表英国人民利益的纲领。
    英国的选举制度，是极不民主的。从理论上讲，每个年满二十一岁的公民，只要有十人提名便可为候选人。但实际上，没有一个普通公民能够得到这样的机会。作为一个候选人，必须付出一百五十镑押金，这些钱约等于一个普通工人两个月的收入。如果得不到八分之一的选票，押金就被没收。其次，候选人只需以简单多数即可当选。某个选区如果有三个或四个候选人，在选票分散的情况下，有人只得三分之一的选票，即可当选，而其它候选人得的票数，就等于全部作废。
    这种选举制度，有利于保守党和工党来控制选区，争夺议员席位，对于一些小党派是十分不利的。因此，甚至像自由党这样的资产阶级政党，也公开攻击两大党对竞选运动的垄断。
    对于英共来说，情况就更加不同。它被剥夺了在英国广播公司进行广播的权利，理由是它的候选人不足五十名。在苏格兰的电视台上，英共的候选人只得到六十秒钟的时间来“解释”竞选纲领。
    但是，真理是窒息不了的。英共的影响，也决不能用得票的多少来加以衡量的。几年以前，只有英共主张召开最高级会议来和缓国际局势。而现在，两大党的领袖都各自标榜：他是同苏联进行协商的最好的代表。
