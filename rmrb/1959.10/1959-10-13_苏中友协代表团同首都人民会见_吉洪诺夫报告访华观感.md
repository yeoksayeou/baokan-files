Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The delegation of the Soviet-China Friendship Association met this afternoon with activists from Beijing who participate in Sino-Soviet friendship activities.

　　This meeting was hosted by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. At the meeting, Wu Han, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, extended a warm welcome to all distinguished guests of the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation.

　　Tikhonov, head of the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation, enthusiastically spoke at the meeting about his impressions of participating in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country and visiting various cities. He said: Every member of the delegation will never forget the grand occasion of the Chinese people warmly celebrating the great festival. We have seen the unity of the Chinese people, who, under the banner of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding son of the Chinese people, are marching forward with firm steps and full of confidence.

　　He said that the numbers reflecting the economic situation are inherently boring, but when he was watching the parade at Tiananmen Square, the numbers on the placards and charts held by the marchers were like poetic language, reflecting that China's economic situation was progressing very well.

　　When talking about the delegation's impressions of visiting cities such as Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Shanghai, Tikhonov said that we saw everywhere the high labor enthusiasm of the people. Whether in the people's communes, factories, or other places, people were enthusiastically working for a happier tomorrow. He said: The most attractive thing in China is people. In today's China, there is nothing more precious than people.

　　Tikhonov also talked about the friendship between the people of Shanghai and the people of Leningrad. He finally said that although the delegation's visit was short, it could feel the deep feelings of Sino-Soviet friendship everywhere.

　　Danilov, the deputy head of the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation, then narrated the traditional friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, and reported on the various activities carried out by the Soviet-China Friendship Association in strengthening the friendship between the people of the two countries.

　　Their speeches were often interrupted by warm applause.

　　At noon today, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the Central Committee of the Communist Young League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the All-China Women's Federation, eight organizations that invited the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation to China, held a reception to bid farewell to the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation.
