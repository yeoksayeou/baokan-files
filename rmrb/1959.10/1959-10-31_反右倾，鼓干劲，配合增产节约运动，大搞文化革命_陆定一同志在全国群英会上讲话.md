Xinhua News Agency, October 30th. Lu Dingyi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, Finance and Trade, entitled "Oppose Right Deviation, Encourage Enthusiasm, Cooperate with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, Vigorously Carry Out Cultural Revolution".

    The Situation on the Cultural and Educational Front is Also Very Good, and the Working People are Rapidly Changing the Backward Situation of Being "Poor and Blank"

Lu Dingyi said that the current situation on the national economic front is very good, and the situation on the cultural and educational front is also very good. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "education serving proletarian politics, education combined with productive labor, and education work led by the Party" and the principle of "walking on two legs" in developing cultural and educational undertakings, profound revolutions have taken place in China's education and cultural education work has greatly developed. At present, the country has a total of 1,017,000 students in full-time, part-time, and spare-time universities. The target of the Second Five-Year Plan has now been completed. Various types of secondary and primary schools have also greatly developed. There are a total of 12,850,000 students in full-time ordinary middle schools, agricultural middle schools, other vocational middle schools, and secondary specialized schools (including secondary normal schools). The enrollment rate of school-age children nationwide reached 87% this year. The Patriotic Health Movement centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases has achieved great results. With the development and consolidation of the people's communes, a rural medical and health network has been initially established across the country, greatly improving medical and health conditions in rural areas. The cultural and artistic undertakings have witnessed an unprecedented prosperity, and sports, broadcasting and other cultural and educational undertakings have also been rapidly developed. Our working people are rapidly changing the backward state of "poverty and blankness" left over from the old China. The broad masses of workers and peasants are arming themselves with socialist and communist ideas and modern scientific and cultural knowledge, and a huge contingent of intellectuals who are both red and expert is taking shape.

    Launch Mass Movements and Implement the Policy of "Walking on Two Legs" to Carry Out Cultural Revolution in a Faster, Better, and More Economical Way

Lu Dingyi said that the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party in May 1958 put forward the task of technical revolution and cultural revolution to the whole Party and the people of the whole country. Cultural revolution, according to Chairman Mao, is the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals. Only when workers, peasants, and intellectuals develop in the direction they lack, can the unreasonable situation left over from the old society be thoroughly changed, the phenomenon of cultural deficiencies among workers and peasants be eliminated, and the bourgeois ideology of intellectuals be eliminated. This is an extremely profound revolution. Practice has increasingly proved that the Party's cultural revolution policy is completely correct.

First, let us look at the laborization of intellectuals. After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, and after implementing the Party's education policy, intellectuals have undergone tremendous changes. In factories and mines, the system of cadres participating in labor and laborers participating in management has been implemented. In the education sector, many schools have established factories and farms. Students are workers when they go to factories, farmers when they go to the countryside, and students in the classroom. Productive labor has enabled young students to strengthen their ties with the workers and peasants, "changed their stand and refined their ideology." The combination of education and labor has enabled a better combination of theory and practice, improved the quality of teaching, promoted scientific research, and eliminated the huge disaster of the separation of theory and practice left to us by bourgeois education.

Lu Dingyi said that great achievements have also been made in the intellectualization of workers and peasants. In the practice of building socialism, the broad masses of workers and peasants have increasingly realized that to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to rapidly improve cultural and technical levels. "Socialism is heaven, and without culture, you can't get in." "Technology is a treasure, and without culture, you can't learn it." These words of the workers and peasants profoundly reflect their urgent need for culture. Facts have proved that once the workers and peasants master culture, science and technology, they are like horses with wings in production, and they can give fuller play to their rich production experience and creativity, and promote the socialist construction cause to leap forward. Since the founding of the country, thanks to the leadership and care of the Party, a group of scientific and technical personnel have emerged among the workers and peasants, and there will be more and more in the future. They will gradually occupy the cultural and scientific fortresses and become the masters of culture and science.

Lu Dingyi pointed out that the high-speed development of industry and agriculture requires a large number of technical cadres and workers with communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge. Therefore, our task is to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, go all out, aim high, and carry out the cultural revolution in a faster, better, and more economical way. We must use the fastest speed to improve the communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge level of workers and peasants, and complete the great historical task of intellectualizing workers and peasants. The experience of the Great Leap Forward proves that to carry out the cultural revolution in a faster, better, and more economical way, we must thoroughly oppose right deviation, make overall plans, launch mass movements, and conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs." The policy of "walking on two legs" in developing education means that we must implement Party-run and mass-run schools on the principle of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, combining the central overall planning and decentralization, that is, the state running schools and factories, mines, enterprises, organs, and people's communes running schools simultaneously, ordinary education and vocational education running simultaneously, children's education and adult education running simultaneously, school education and self-study (including correspondence schools and radio schools) running simultaneously, free education and non-free education running simultaneously, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and strength of all sectors of society to run schools, using the fastest speed and the least money to run more cultural and educational undertakings to meet the needs of the masses and the needs of national construction. The great development of cultural and educational work last year and this year is a victory for the policy of "walking on two legs." Throughout the country, in just a few months, tens of thousands of spare-time schools, agricultural middle schools, and ordinary primary and secondary schools and kindergartens have been established. The vast majority of regions in the country have basically achieved that every team in the people's commune has kindergartens and primary schools, the vast majority of people's communes have junior middle schools, the vast majority of counties have senior high schools, and the vast majority of special districts have secondary specialized schools and higher vocational schools, and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have various types of universities. This has powerfully refuted the right-leaning view that the cultural revolution cannot launch mass movements, cannot be faster, better, and more economical, and cannot "walk on two legs."

    The work of eliminating illiteracy can be carried out at a high speed; the popularization of primary school education should also "walk on two legs."

Lu Dingyi then talked about the issue of eliminating illiteracy. He said that the illiteracy elimination movement in 1958 achieved unprecedented great results. Last year, the number of young and middle-aged people participating in illiteracy elimination studies across the country reached over 100 million, of which 50 million have already gotten rid of illiteracy. This experience proves that the work of eliminating illiteracy can be carried out at a high speed. Among the existing 80 million young and middle-aged illiterates, only a few are completely illiterate, which has prepared favorable conditions for future illiteracy elimination work. In industrial and mining enterprises, illiteracy generally accounts for about 20% to 30%. Except for a few factories and mines with a large number of illiterates, as long as we put in some effort, we can basically eliminate illiteracy this winter and next spring. For young and middle-aged people who have already gotten rid of illiteracy, we should run a large number of spare-time primary schools and spare-time secondary schools, and enroll them to consolidate the results of illiteracy elimination and further improve their cultural level.

Lu Dingyi said that we should popularize primary school education among school-age children across the country. This year, about 87% of school-age children are enrolled in school. As long as we make more efforts, it will not be very difficult to reach 95%. The popularization of primary school education should also "walk on two legs" and adopt a variety of forms. The popularization of junior middle school education is the inevitable trend of educational development. In order to achieve the goal of popularizing junior middle school education as soon as possible, we must resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs." In large cities, we should run full-time and part-time junior middle schools, and we can also run radio schools. In rural areas, we should develop agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools.

    Industrial and mining enterprises should formulate development plans for employee education, combine production and education, and strive to cultivate new people with communist ideals.

Lu Dingyi focused on the issue of running schools in industrial and mining enterprises. He said that popularizing education among employees is an important condition for carrying out technological revolution, increasing labor productivity, and accelerating socialist construction. At present, although the cultural level of employees in industrial and mining enterprises across the country has greatly improved compared with before liberation, the task of education work is still very arduous. If we eliminate illiteracy in factories and mines, and raise the existing primary school level young and middle-aged employees to the middle school level, and raise the existing middle school level employees with conditions to the university level in a few years, it will have a huge impact on the development and technological improvement of our national industry, and it will also lay a good foundation for us to popularize higher education among the broad masses of employees in the future. We hope that all regions and all factories and mining enterprises can go all out and formulate development plans for employee education based on actual possibilities. Factories and mines are mainly engaged in production. To run education in factories and mines, we must implement the principle of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity." The content, methods, and systems of education must be determined according to the production characteristics of factories and mines. Factories and mines generally have relatively strong technical forces, and can run various levels of part-time and spare-time schools. Large factories and mines can also run spare-time universities, and some factories and mines can also cooperate with neighboring universities to run them together.

At present, the educational undertakings of factories and mines are under the leadership of party committees at all levels, sponsored by trade unions, and actively assisted by education departments and other relevant government departments. Trade unions at all levels have allocated a lot of funds for this purpose. This is very good. However, it is not enough to have only the funds from the trade union, and each factory and mining enterprise needs to allocate a portion of the "factory fund" to run schools. Socialist industrial and mining enterprises should not only produce material products and create new products, but also strive to cultivate new people with communist ideals. This is the fundamental difference between our socialist industrial and mining enterprises and capitalist industrial and mining enterprises. The cultural and technical level, political consciousness, and moral character of people—laborers and managers—directly affect and determine the production of things. Our industrial and mining enterprises have the responsibility to gradually ensure that all employees have a high level of communist political consciousness and moral character, as well as a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge. This is an extremely great revolutionary cause that requires us to work tirelessly. Therefore, we must not only thoroughly overcome the tendency of being detached from production and reality that existed in school education in the past, but also overcome the tendency of "seeing things but not people," neglecting the political and ideological education of people, and not paying attention to improving the cultural and scientific knowledge level of workers in some factories and mining enterprises in the past. In factories and mines, we must combine production with education.

    Vigorously train industrial technical cadres, agricultural technicians, and teachers to meet the needs of socialist construction.

Lu Dingyi went on to say that cultivating and establishing a strong contingent of industrial technical cadres of the working class is an indispensable and important condition for our country to build socialism; it is also an important condition for continuously improving technical level and labor productivity and ensuring the continued high-speed development of our country's industry. In recent years, the number of engineering and technical personnel in our country has greatly increased. Up to now, there are about one million engineering and technical personnel in the country, but this is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, the training of engineering and technical cadres must also adopt the policy of "walking on two legs." Every factory and mining enterprise with conditions has the responsibility to run various schools in every possible way to train engineering and technical personnel. Higher industrial schools and secondary technical schools, whenever they have the conditions, also have the responsibility to run spare-time schools and correspondence schools in addition to running their own schools well to train more industrial cadres.

In addition to industrial technical forces, we must also train agricultural technicians to achieve the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture. There are only 170,000 agricultural technicians in the country now. But what we need is one million senior and intermediate agricultural technicians, and an even greater number of junior technicians. This is a very large task. We must complete this task at a high speed.

The training and replenishment of teachers is the key to ensuring the rapid development of education and ensuring the improvement of the quality of education. The current problem is that the source of teachers is insufficient. The only way to solve this problem is to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" in the training of teachers. Teachers shoulder a very glorious and huge task in the cultural revolution, and they will certainly not disappoint the expectations of the people and make even more outstanding achievements.

    All aspects of cultural and educational work must be politically in command, obey the leadership of the Party Committee, and follow the mass line.

Lu Dingyi said that our science and technology, culture and art, health and sports, and other cultural and educational undertakings should also have corresponding development. It is necessary to enable China's science and technology to quickly catch up with the most advanced level in the world. Advanced producer comrades, you must not only complete production tasks outstandingly, but also continue to go all out in studying science and technology, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do, invent and create, and quickly climb to the highest peak of science and technology. We must continue to further prosper our literature and art and create more outstanding works under the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialist construction, and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"; continue to improve the ideological and artistic nature of movies and dramas, actively expand the urban and rural screening network of movies; continue to improve the quality of publications, appropriately develop the quantity, and actively meet the needs of the masses. According to the principles of need, voluntariness, and spare time, vigorously carry out mass cultural and artistic activities and mass creation, and enliven the cultural life of workers, peasants, and soldiers to inspire the production enthusiasm of the masses. The health cause must continue to carry out the mass patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, strengthen the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and further actively develop and improve the medical and preventive work of cities, factories, mines, and rural people's communes, so as to better protect people's health and ensure the continued Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. The sports cause must continue to implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, developing mass sports activities, and better serving the enhancement of people's health and serving labor production and national defense construction.

Lu Dingyi emphasized that cultural and educational work, whether it is education, health, culture, sports, news, and other undertakings, must be politically in command, obey the leadership of the Party Committee, and must not "carry out culture and education for the sake of culture and education." We must follow the mass line and combine experts with the masses, and must not follow a purely expert line. We advocate that experts must be both red and expert, must be combined with the masses, and must accept the leadership of the Party. Whether or not we listen to the leadership of the Party and whether or not we listen to Chairman Mao's words is our political dividing line with the bourgeoisie, and there is no ambiguity allowed here. We must resolutely fight against any tendency to oppose the leadership of the Party.

Lu Dingyi finally said, comrades, these are some of the main tasks in the cultural revolution. Let our national advanced producers and the entire working class, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Comrade Mao Zedong, hold higher the red flag of the general line of socialist construction, and further carry out the technical revolution and the cultural revolution on the basis of the great victories of last year and this year.

    反右倾，鼓干劲，配合增产节约运动，大搞文化革命
    陆定一同志在全国群英会上讲话
    新华社30日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理陆定一，30日在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上以“反右倾，鼓干劲，配合增产节约运动，大搞文化革命”为题作了讲话。
    文化教育战线上的形势同样好得很，劳动人民正在迅速改变着“一穷二白”的落后面貌
    陆定一说，目前全国经济战线上形势很好，文化教育战线上的形势也好得很。党中央提出“教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，教育工作要由党来领导”和发展文化教育事业要实行“两条腿走路”的方针以来，我国的教育事业发生了深刻的革命，文化教育工作都有了很大发展。现在，全国已经有全日制、半日制和业余高等学校学生共计一百零一万七千人。原订第二个五年计划的指标，现在已经完成了。各类中等学校和初等学校也都有很大的发展。全日制普通中学、农业中学及其他职业中学，中等专业学校（包括中等师范）的学生共计一千二百八十五万人。全国学龄儿童的入学率今年达到87％。以除四害、讲卫生，消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动取得了很大的成绩。随着人民公社的发展和巩固，全国已经初步建立起农村医疗卫生网，大大改善了农村的医疗卫生条件。文化艺术事业出现了空前繁荣的景象，体育、广播及其他文教事业也得到了极为迅速的发展。我们的劳动人民，正在迅速地改变着旧中国“一穷二白”的落后面貌。广大的工农群众正在用社会主义、共产主义思想和现代科学文化知识武装自己，一支庞大的又红又专的知识分子队伍正在形成。
    大搞群众运动，贯彻执行“两条腿走路”方针，多快好省地进行文化革命
    陆定一说，1958年5月党的八大二次会议向全党和全国人民提出了技术革命和文化革命的任务。文化革命，照毛主席的说法，就是工农群众知识化，和知识分子劳动化。工农群众和知识分子双方各向自己缺乏的方面发展，才能彻底改变旧社会遗留下来的不合理的状况，消灭工农群众缺乏文化的现象，也消灭知识分子的资产阶级思想。这是一个极其深刻的革命。实践愈来愈证明，党所确定的文化革命的方针是完全正确的。
    我们首先看一看知识分子劳动化的状况。经过1957年的整风运动和反右派斗争，经过贯彻执行党的教育方针，知识分子已经发生了巨大的变化。在厂矿企业里，实行了干部参加劳动和劳动者参加管理工作的制度，在教育界，许多学校建立了工厂和农场，学生到工厂是工人，到农村是农民，在课堂是学生。生产劳动使青年学生密切了和工农群众的联系，“改变了立场，炼红了思想”。教育与劳动结合，使理论和实际更好的结合起来，提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究，消除了资产阶级教育给我们遗留下来的理论与实际脱节的巨大祸害。
    陆定一说，在工农群众知识化方面，也取得了很大成绩。广大工农群众在建设社会主义的实践中越来越深刻地体会到，要多快好省地建设社会主义，必须迅速提高文化水平和技术水平。“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”，“技术是个宝，没有文化学不了。”工农群众的这些话都是深刻地体现了他们对文化的迫切要求。事实证明，工农群众一旦掌握了文化科学和技术，在生产中好比骏马添了双翼，就能够更充分地发挥他们丰富的生产经验和创造性，推动社会主义建设事业飞跃前进。建国以来，由于党的领导和关怀，在工农群众当中已经出现了一批科学技术人员，将来还要越来越多，他们将逐步攻占文化科学的堡垒，成为文化和科学的主人。
    陆定一指出，工农业高速度的发展，需要大量的具有共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识的技术干部和工人，因此我们的任务就是要根据党的社会主义建设总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地大搞文化革命，用最快的速度提高工农群众的共产主义觉悟和文化科学知识水平，完成工农群众知识化这个伟大的历史任务。大跃进的经验证明，要多快好省地进行文化革命，必须彻底反对右倾，全面规划，大搞群众运动，认真贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。发展教育事业上的“两条腿走路”的方针，这就是说，必须在统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、中央全面规划与地方分权相结合的原则下，实行全党全民办学，即国家办学与厂矿、企业、机关、人民公社办学并举，普通教育与职业教育并举，儿童教育与成人教育并举，学校教育与自学（包括函授学校、广播学校）并举，免费教育与不免费的教育并举，充分调动社会上各方面办学的积极性和力量，以最快的速度，用最少的钱，办更多的文化教育事业，来满足群众的需要和国家建设的需要。去年和今年文化教育工作的大发展，就是“两条腿走路”方针的胜利。全国各地，在短短的几个月内，办起了数以万计的业余学校、农业中学和普通中小学及幼儿园。全国绝大多数地区，基本上都做到了人民公社队队有幼儿园和小学，绝大部分人民公社有初中，绝大部分县有高中，绝大部分专区有中等专业学校和高等专科学校，省、市、自治区有各类高等学校。这就有力地驳斥了那种认为文化革命不能大搞群众运动，不能多快好省，不能“两条腿走路”的右倾观点。
    扫盲工作完全可以高速度进行；普及小学教育也要“两条腿走路”
    陆定一接着谈到扫盲问题。他说，1958年扫盲运动获得了空前巨大的成绩。去年一年全国参加扫盲学习的青壮年人数达一亿以上，其中已经摆脱了文盲状态的达五千万人。这个经验，证明扫盲工作是可以高速度地进行的。在现有的八千多万青壮年文盲中，一字不识的只占少数，这就为今后的扫盲工作准备了有利条件。在工矿企业中，文盲一般约占20％到30％左右，除少数文盲较多的厂矿外，只要鼓一把劲，在今冬明春就可以基本扫除文盲。对已经脱离了文盲状态的青壮年，要大办业余初等学校，和业余中等学校。吸收他们入学，以巩固扫盲成果，和进一步提高他们的文化水平。
  陆定一说，我们要在全国学龄儿童中普及小学教育。今年学龄儿童入学的占87％左右，只要再加努力，达到95％是不很困难的。普及小学教育也要“两条腿走路”，采取多种多样的形式。普及初中教育，这是教育发展的必然趋势。为了早日达到普及初中教育的目的，必须坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，在大城市里应该办全日制和半日制的初级中学，还可以办广播学校，在农村里应该发展农业中学和各种职业中学。
    工矿企业要订出职工教育发展规划，把生产和教育结合起来，努力培养共产主义的新人
    陆定一着重谈到工矿企业办学问题。他说，在职工中普及教育是开展技术革命，提高劳动生产率，加速社会主义建设的一项重要条件。目前全国工矿企业职工文化程度虽然比解放前有很大提高，但是教育工作的任务还很艰巨。如果我们在厂矿企业中扫除文盲，并以几年的时间，把现有小学程度的青壮年职工提高到中学水平，把现有中学水平的、有条件的职工提高到高等学校水平，对我们国家工业的发展和技术的提高，将会发生巨大的作用，对我们将来在广大职工中普及高等教育，也将打下一个良好的基础。我们希望各地区各厂矿企业都能鼓足干劲，根据实际的可能，订出职工教育的发展规划。厂矿企业是以生产为主，在厂矿企业中办教育，要贯彻“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”的原则。教育的内容、方法和制度，必须根据厂矿企业生产的特点来确定。厂矿企业一般都有比较雄厚的技术力量，可以举办各级的半日制的和业余的学校，大的厂矿还可举办业余大学，有些厂矿还可和邻近的高等学校协作，共同举办。
    现在厂矿企业的教育事业，是在各级党委领导下，由工会主办，由教育部门和政府的其他有关部门积极加以协助。各级工会为此拨出了不少经费。这是很好的。但是，光有工会的经费，还是不够的，需要各厂矿企业拨出一部分“工厂基金”来办学。社会主义的工矿企业，不仅要生产物质的产品和创造新产品，还要努力培养共产主义的新人。这是我们社会主义的厂矿企业同资本主义的厂矿企业根本不同的地方。人——劳动者和管理工作者——的文化技术水平、政治觉悟和道德品质，直接影响和决定着物的生产。我们的厂矿企业，有责任逐步做到全体职工人人都具有高度的共产主义政治觉悟和道德品质，又有很高的文化科学水平。这是一件极其伟大的革命事业，需要我们坚持不懈地去进行工作。因此，我们不仅要彻底克服过去学校教育中存在着的脱离生产，脱离实际的倾向，还必须克服过去某些厂矿企业工作中“见物不见人”、忽视人的政治思想教育和不注意提高工人文化科学知识水平的倾向。在工矿企业中，要把生产同教育结合起来。
    大力培养工业技术干部、农业技术人员和师资，满足社会主义建设的需要
    陆定一接着说，培养和建立起一支强大的工人阶级的工业技术干部队伍，是我国建成社会主义必不可少的重要条件；也是不断提高技术水平和劳动生产率，保证我国工业继续高速度发展的重要条件。几年来我国工程技术人员在数量上有了很大的增加。到目前为止，全国已有工程技术人员约一百万人左右，但还远远不能满足需要。因此，工程技术干部的培养工作，也必须采取“两条腿走路”的方针。每个有条件的厂矿企业都有责任，千方百计地举办各种学校，培养工程技术人材。高等工业学校和中等技术学校，凡是有条件的，也有责任，除了办好本校以外，举办业余学校、函授学校，来培养更多的工业干部。
    除了工业的技术力量以外，我们还要培养农业的技术人员，来实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。全国的农业技术人员，现在只有十七万人。但是我们的需要，却是一百万高级和中级的农业技术人员，和数目更多的初级技术人员。这是一个很大的任务。我们必须以很快的速度来完成这个任务。
    师资的培养补充是保证教育事业迅速发展和保证提高教育质量的关键。现在的问题是师资的来源不足。解决这个问题的唯一出路，就是在师资的培养方面也必须贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针。教师们在文化革命中担负着十分光荣而又巨大的任务，他们一定不会辜负人民的期待，做出更出色的成绩。
    文化教育工作中的各个方面都必须政治挂帅，服从党委的领导，走群众路线
    陆定一说，我们的科学技术、文化艺术、卫生体育事业和其他文教事业也应该有相应的发展。必须使我国科学技术迅速地赶上世界最先进的水平。先进生产者同志们，你们不但要出色地完成生产任务，还要在钻研科学技术方面继续鼓足干劲，破除迷信，敢想敢做，发明创造，迅速攀登上科学技术的最高峰。我们要继续在为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针下，进一步繁荣我们的文学和艺术，创作更出色的作品；继续提高电影和戏剧的思想性、艺术性，积极扩大电影的城乡放映网；继续提高出版物的质量，适当地发展数量，积极满足群众的需要。根据需要、自愿和业余的原则，大力开展群众文化艺术活动和群众创作，活跃工农群众文化生活，来鼓舞群众的生产热情。卫生事业要继续开展以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的群众性的爱国卫生运动，加强中医和西医的团结，进一步积极发展和提高城市的、厂矿的和农村人民公社的医疗预防工作，更好地保护人民健康、保证社会主义建设的继续大跃进。体育事业必须继续贯彻普及和提高相结合的方针，发展群众的体育运动，更好地为增进人民健康，为劳动生产与国防建设服务。
    陆定一强调说，文教工作，不论是教育、卫生、文化、体育、新闻等项事业，都必须政治挂帅，服从党委的领导，千万不可以“为文教而文教”。必须走群众路线，使专家与群众结合起来，千万不要走单纯的专家路线。我们主张专家必须又红又专，必须同群众结合，必须接受党的领导。听不听党的领导，听不听毛主席的话，这是我们同资产阶级的政治分界线，这里一点也不许含糊。对于任何反对党的领导的倾向，我们必须与之坚决斗争。
    陆定一最后说，同志们，这就是文化革命方面的一些主要任务。让我们全国的先进生产者和全体工人阶级，和全国人民一道，在伟大中国共产党和各族人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的红旗，在去年和今年的伟大胜利的基础上，进一步开展技术革命和文化革命。
