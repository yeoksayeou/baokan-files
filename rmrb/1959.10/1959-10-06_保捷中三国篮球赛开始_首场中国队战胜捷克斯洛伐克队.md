    Xinhua News Agency, 4th — The Chinese national men's basketball team defeated the European runner-up, the Czechoslovakian national men's basketball team, tonight with a score of 82 to 64. This was the first friendly match between the national men's basketball teams of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and China.

    More than 7,000 spectators watched this tense and exciting international basketball game, which was tied seven times, at the Beijing Indoor Stadium. The wonderful performances of both sides repeatedly won enthusiastic applause and cheers from the audience during the game.

    The Chinese team played calmly, flexibly, actively, and proactively today. Less than a minute into the game, the exceptionally active right forward Yang Boyong scored a goal under the basket. In the following ten minutes, the game was in a stalemate. Yang Boyong, Qian Chenghai, Zhang Xishan, and Wang Jiazhen of the Chinese team repeatedly scored from the left and right corners with accurate mid-range shots, and Cai Jijie also scored multiple free throws. The Czechoslovakian team scored with shots from the perimeter and under the basket by Sieber (No. 15), Baumruk (No. 11), and the tall center Tomasek (No. 3). The score became tied at three, five, eight, nine, eleven, thirteen, and twenty-one, creating a difficult and inseparable situation.

    After the Chinese team paused to discuss countermeasures and launched a fast break, they broke the deadlock. Wang Jiazhen and Cai Jijie's accurate shots and Yang Boyong's reverse shot quickly gave them a ten-point lead of 33-23 and 36-26. At this time, the visiting team also requested a timeout and replaced the tallest center (1.98 meters) Twardy (No. 14) and Konvička (No. 8), who is 1.90 meters tall, in an attempt to reverse the situation. However, the Chinese team attacked even more fiercely, maintaining a ten-point lead of 38-28 and 40-30. At the end of the first half, the Chinese team led 44-30.

    In the second half, the Czechoslovakian team relied on Twardy, who was good at activities under the basket, as the main scoring force, cooperating with Lukašik (No. 6), Z. Rylich (No. 10), Sieber (No. 15) and others, who were fast, accurate in shooting, and had strong breakthrough abilities, to launch a tenacious counterattack. After the Chinese team led by eighteen points at 54-36, they repeatedly took advantage of the Chinese team's passing errors and made efforts to grab rebounds in more than three minutes, launching a fast break, and catching up to 51-56, only five points behind, in the ninth minute of the second half. At this time, the game reached a climax, and the audience's applause and cheers resounded throughout the hall of the stadium.

    The Chinese team adjusted its lineup, replacing Wang Lifa and Fu Ruide with scoring experts Cai Jijie and Wang Jiazhen, and the situation changed again, regaining a ten-point lead of 63-53, 65-55, 68-58, and 70-60, and finally winning by a lead of eighteen points at the end of the game.

    Before the start of this friendly match, the opening ceremony of the Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and China national men's basketball friendly match was held. The band played the national anthems of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and China.

    After the game, Vice Premier He Long, accompanied by the head of the Czechoslovak sports delegation, the chairman of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation, F. Fudeslen, and others, met with the athletes of both sides on the court. (Attached picture)
