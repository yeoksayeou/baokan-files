Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: The Japanese General Council of Trade Unions (Sohyo)'s Second National Youth and Women Representatives Conference passed a motion on future movement directions, stating that youth and women should stand at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle and strive to launch a struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　The conference, which closed today, began on the 12th in Tokyo. More than 300 youth and women worker representatives from 50 trade unions across the country participated in the conference.

　　The motion passed by the conference pointed out that the root of the "industrial rationalization" attacks launched by the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capitalists against workers in all industrial sectors lies in the Japan-U.S. "security system." Therefore, the struggle against "industrial rationalization" must be combined with the struggle against the "security system," and joint struggle organizations including youth and women must be organized in all regions.

　　The motion also emphasized that in the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," it is necessary to emphasize the realization of Japan's neutralization.

　　The motion stipulated that in order to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, it is necessary to promote the significance of the joint statement issued by the Japanese youth and women delegation and the All-China Youth Federation on May 4th of this year to all working youth and women, and to actively exchange letters and various materials with Chinese youth and women.

　　The motion also stipulated that youth and women will actively participate in the large-scale anti-unemployment march scheduled for November, strive to improve the working conditions of young workers and achieve equal pay for equal work, and strive to strengthen solidarity with rural youth.

　　The conference unanimously expressed its support for Khrushchev's proposal on complete disarmament. The conference also decided to strive to promote the important significance of this proposal and fight for the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons and the prevention of the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial today calling on the working class to launch a massive autumn struggle and deal a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and monopoly capital.

　　The editorial pointed out that the Japanese workers' autumn struggle, which began with Kyushu coal miners opposing "industrial rationalization," is of great significance. Monopoly capital attempts to first lay off more than half of the workers in the coal miners' union, destroy and strike at one of the most powerful unions in Japan—the coal miners' union—and then launch a comprehensive reactionary attack on the working class and democratic forces.

　　"Akahata" pointed out that the attack on the organized main force of the working class is a brutal attack on the basic rights and democracy of the people. In order to deal with this attack by the enemy, it is necessary to thoroughly expose the enemy's political conspiracy, and at the same time, a powerful united front needs to be organized. The editorial pointed out that it is the Japanese monopoly capital and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which implements a trade policy subservient to the United States, that artificially hinder the development of the coal industry. Therefore, the direction of the struggle against "industrial rationalization" and the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" as well as other struggles for independence and neutrality are consistent.

　　"Akahata" pointed out that the struggle of the Kyushu coal miners against "industrial rationalization" must be developed into a nationwide struggle. It called on the Socialist Party and the working class to firmly support the unified action of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in order to jointly launch a struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and oppose "industrial rationalization."

　　日“总评”全国青年、妇女代表会议决定
    开展阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争
    “赤旗报”号召在秋季斗争中沉重打击岸内阁
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第二次全国青年、妇女代表会议通过今后的运动方针表示，青年和妇女们要站在日本人民斗争的前列，努力开展阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    在今天闭幕的这次会议是从12日起在东京举行的。来自全国五十个工会的三百多名青年、妇女工人代表参加了会议。
    会议通过的方针指出，目前岸信介政府和垄断资本家在所有产业部门中向工人发动的“产业合理化”攻击的根源在于日美“安全体系”。因此必须把反对“产业合理化”的斗争和反对“安全体系”的斗争结合起来，并且要在一切地区组织包括青年、妇女在内的共同斗争组织。
    方针还着重指出，在反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中，必须强调实现日本中立化。
    方针规定，为了争取恢复日中邦交，必须向所有的劳动青年、妇女宣传日本青年与妇女访华代表团同中华全国青年联合会在今年5月4日发表的共同声明的意义，并且要积极地同中国青年、妇女交换书信和各种资料。
    方针还规定，青年和妇女们将积极参加预定在11月举行的反对失业大游行，为争取改善青年工人的劳动条件和实现同工同酬，争取加强同农村青年的团结而努力。
    会议一致表示支持赫鲁晓夫关于全面裁军的建议。会议并且决定，将努力宣传这项建议的重要意义，为争取立即无条件禁止核武器和阻止向日本运进核武器而斗争。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召工人阶级展开声势浩大的秋季斗争，给予岸信介内阁和垄断资本沉重的打击。
    社论指出，以九州煤矿工人反对“产业合理化”而开始的日本工人秋季斗争具有很重要的意义。垄断资本企图先解雇占煤矿工会一半以上的工人，破坏和打击日本最有力量的工会之一——煤矿工会，然后对工人阶级和民主力量发动全面的反动攻击。
    “赤旗报”指出，对工人阶级有组织的主力部队的攻击就是对人民的基本权利和民主的凶恶的攻击。为了对付敌人这种攻击，必须彻底揭穿敌人的政治阴谋，同时需要组织强大的统一战线。社论指出，用人为力量阻挠煤炭工业发展的是日本垄断资本和执行屈从美国的贸易政策的岸信介内阁。因此，反对“产业合理化”的斗争和阻止修改“安全条约”以及其他争取独立、中立的斗争的方向是一致的。
    “赤旗报”指出，必须使九州煤矿工人反对“产业合理化”的斗争发展成为全国规模的斗争。它呼吁社会党和工人阶级坚决支持社会党和共产党的统一行动，以便联合展开阻止修改“安全条约”和反对“产业合理化”的斗争。
