Where There's a Will, There's a Way
——A Dedication to the Beijing Architectural Engineering Tour for the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
Chen Yi

I
	The Great Hall of the People,
	Truly magnificent, truly glorious.
	Only the people's great democracy,
	Could produce such a great hall.
	Look at the narrowness and decay of the old world,
	It is deteriorating,
	It cannot do this,
	It doesn't even dare to think this way!

II
	The Museum of the Revolution and the Museum of History,
	Are linked together into a huge palace.
	The exhibition of historical relics,
	Starts from the Yangshao Culture,
	Until now.
	The entire history is threaded by a red line,
	That is the people's continuous struggle for progress, ultimately leading to the people's complete liberation.
	The great Chinese people who have been liberated,
	The current direction of action:
	Is the General Line,
	Is the People's Commune,
	Is the Great Leap Forward!

III
	The architectural style of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall is Eastern.
	Pavilions and kiosks contain countless high-yield satellites.
	The People's Commune and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture,
	Represent the Great Leap Forward in the national countryside.
	The People's Commune is a great direction,
	It has eradicated the roots of China's backwardness!
	The Chinese people have found such a form of social organization,
	Which facilitates the transition to socialism and the march towards communism.

IV
	The Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution,
	Is an ocean of heroic deeds.
	Showing the great image of the Chinese people.
	The People's Army never leaves the people for a minute,
	It always follows Chairman Mao and its own Party.
	An army armed with Marxism-Leninism,
	Is truly invincible,
	Truly radiant.

V
	Entering the Beijing Railway Station,
	We see towering buildings soaring into the sky;
	We see roads leading to the distance.
	Dozens of railway lines connect the whole country.
	There are daily exchanges with the whole world.
	China's transportation artery,
	It is growing, growing!
	It will be extended, extended!
	It carries our great motherland,
	To a happy paradise.

VI
	The Nationalities Palace is majestic and towering,
	The green and yellow glazed tiles shine brightly.
	My great motherland has more than fifty nationalities,
	Building unity is blossoming with flowers.
	Each ethnic group has its own way of life,
	Respecting each other,
	Learning from each other.
	Socialism is our common goal,
	The motherland is our mother,
	Is our home.

VII
	The Workers' Stadium can accommodate 80,000 spectators,
	Here are all kinds of modern sports equipment.
	At the National Games,
	Several world records have been broken,
	More than a hundred national records have been refreshed.
	This achievement is very great.
	Regardless of whether the weather is cloudy or sunny, windy or rainy,
	Regardless of autumn, winter, spring or summer,
	You can see Chinese youth diligently engaged in physical exercise,
	Their healthy physique is as developed as their love for the motherland and socialist ideology.

VIII
	We are touring the Overseas Chinese Building.
	Children of the motherland return from overseas,
	To settle here.
	You do peaceful and friendly work abroad,
	You come back to visit the construction of the motherland.
	Welcome back!
	The big family of the motherland embraces you!
	With a common patriotic enthusiasm,
	We celebrate the great progress of the motherland,
	And strive for a more prosperous motherland.

IX
	Beijing's various hotels and hostels,
	Have prepared bright windows and clean tables,
	To entertain distinguished guests from dozens of countries.
	Various furnishings and gardens,
	Vividly welcome guests.
	We expect in about twenty years,
	To universalize modern living conditions to every family.

X
	The Industrial Exhibition Hall was built a few years ago,
	It has gone through many exhibitions.
	But this exhibition,
	Shows that China's industrialization has reached a new stage.
	The wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working class,
	Has arranged a beautiful today,
	And will strive for a more beautiful tomorrow.
	Let the Chinese people climb to the peak of modern science and technology.
	We will definitely be able to climb!
	We will not lag behind,
	We want to be pioneers!

XI
	The National Day project is the embodiment of the General Line.
	The National Day project is the embodiment of the Great Leap Forward.
	The National Day project is the embodiment of national cooperation.
	The Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture created "China Speed,"
	And the National Day project is a concrete manifestation of this speed.
	This reflects the great will of 600 million people to engage in construction.
	This is changing China's face every day.
	More than 600 million people organized in a big country,
	Going all out, aiming high,
	Is appearing for the first time in history.

XII
	This is only the beginning,
	Great projects are still left behind.
	We want to build a Science Palace;
	We want to build an Art Gallery;
	We want to build a Library Building;
	We want to build a National Grand Theater;
	We want to build an underground railway,
	To improve the traffic and safety of the capital.
	We also want to build hundreds of residential buildings,
	So that millions of citizens can eat and live happily.

XIII
	The Tenth Anniversary National Day projects are all completed in ten months with two or three years' worth of work.
	This is truly more, faster, better, and more economical.
	The people have a firm belief in socialism,
	The people have deep feelings for socialism.
	After fully developing socialism,
	It will rapidly rise to the level of communism.
	No matter how the imperialists curse,
	No matter what the rightists think,
	We still firmly follow the mass line,
	We continue to move forward.
	Look, how touching the Chinese proverb is,
	It says: "Where there's a will, there's a way!"

    有志者事竟成
    ——建国十周年北京建筑工程巡礼献辞
    陈毅
    一
    人民大会堂，
    真伟大，真辉煌。
    只有人民的大民主，
    才产生这样的大会堂。
    看那旧世界的狭窄、衰败，
    它每况愈下，
    它不能这样做，
    它也不敢这样想！
    二
    革命博物馆与历史博物馆，
    联结成一座巨大的宫殿。
    历史文物展览，
    从仰韶文化起，
    直到如今。
    全部历史被一条红线贯穿着，
    就是人民不断争取进步最后到人民总翻身。
    翻了身的伟大的中国人民，
    现在的行动方向：
    就是总路线，
    就是人民公社，
    就是大跃进！
    三
    农业展览馆的建筑风格是东方型。
    楼阁亭台里包藏着无数高产卫星。
    人民公社与八字宪法，
    代表了全国农村的大跃进。
    人民公社是伟大方向，
    它拔掉了中国落后的根！
    中国人民找着这样的社会组织形式，
    便利完成社会主义转向共产主义进军。
    四
    中国人民革命军事博物馆，
    是英雄事迹的海洋。
    表现着中国人民的伟大形象。
    人民军队一分钟也不离开人民，
    它永远跟着毛主席和自己的党。
    一支被马列主义思想所武装的军队，
    真是无敌，
    真是光芒万丈。
    五
    走进北京车站，
    只见崇楼杰阁挺向天空；
    只见条条道路通向远方。
    几十条铁路线把全国联结起来。
    与全世界每日都有来往。
    中国的交通大动脉，
    它正在增长，增长！
    它还要延长，延长！
    它把我们伟大的祖国，
    载运到幸福的天堂。
    六
    民族宫雄奇挺拔，
    绿黄琉璃瓦大放光华。
    我伟大祖国共有五十几个民族，
    团结建设正开着朵朵鲜花。
    各族人民有各自的生活方式，
    互相尊重，
    互相学习。
    社会主义是我们的共同目标，
    祖国是我们的母亲，
    是我们的家。
    七
    工人体育场容纳八万观众，
    这里有各种现代化的体育设备。
    在全国运动会上，
    已打破几项世界纪录，
    全国纪录有一百多项已被刷新。
    这成绩非常之大。
    不论天气阴晴风雨，
    也不论秋冬春夏，
    你可以看见中国青年都勤于体育锻炼，
    他们健壮的体质和他们爱祖国爱社会主义的思想一样发达。
    八
    我们巡礼到华侨大厦。
    祖国儿女从海外归来，
    在此驻扎。
    你们在国外做和平友好工作，
    你们回来参观祖国的建设。
    欢迎你们回来！
    祖国大家庭拥抱你们！
    我们以共同的爱国热忱，
    庆祝祖国的伟大进步，
    争取祖国更加繁荣。
    九
    北京各个宾馆旅社，
    准备了明窗净几，
    款待几十个国家的贵宾。
    各种陈设与庭园，
    鲜活地欢迎客人。
    我们期望二十年左右，
    要把现代化的居住条件普遍到每一家庭。
    十
    工业展览馆兴修在前几年，
    经过了多少次展览。
    可这一次的展览，
    表现了中国工业化达到新阶段。
    中国工人阶级的智慧与创造，
    安排了美好的今天，
    还要争取更美好的明天。
    现代科学技术的顶峰让中国人民去攀登。
    我们一定能够攀登！
    我们不落后，
    我们要争先！
    十一
    国庆工程是总路线的体现。
    国庆工程是大跃进的体现。
    国庆工程是全国大协作的体现。
    工农业大跃进创造出“中国速度”，
    而国庆工程又是这速度的具体体现。
    这反映了六亿人民干建设的伟大志愿。
    这样使中国的面貌每天都在改变。
    六亿多人民在一个大国中组织起来，
    鼓足干劲力争上游，
    在历史上还是第一次出现。
    十二
    这仅是开端，
    伟大的工程还留在后面。
    我们要修科学宫；
    我们要修艺术馆；
    我们要修图书大楼；
    我们要修国立大剧院；
    我们要修地下铁道，
    改善大首都的交通和安全。
    我们更要修几百幢住宅，
    使几百万市民食宿俱欢颜。
    十三
    十周年国庆工程都是把二三年的工作量用十个月来完成。
    这真是多快好省。
    人民对社会主义有了坚定信念，
    人民对社会主义产生了深厚的感情。
    在充分发展社会主义之后，
    将迅速提高到共产主义的水平。
    不管帝国主义者如何咒骂，
    也不管姓右的人怎么个看法，
    我们仍然坚决的走群众路线，
    我们继续前进。
    你瞧，中国的古语多么动人，
    它说：“有志者事竟成！”
