Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a banquet this afternoon to entertain the leaders of the visiting groups and youth study groups of various ethnic minorities in Beijing.

The banquet was presided over by Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of unity and joy, with guests and hosts frequently raising their glasses to congratulate the prosperity of the great family of the motherland of all ethnic groups.

Li Weihan delivered a speech at the banquet. First, on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he expressed a warm welcome and congratulations to the ethnic minority visiting groups and youth study groups from all over the country.

He said that ten years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Republic of China was established, thus ending the history of oppression and rule of all ethnic groups in our country by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; and fundamentally abolished the system of national oppression, and established a new relationship of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation among all ethnic groups. This is a historical turning point for all ethnic groups in our country from division and inequality to unity and equality.

Li Weihan said that the establishment of the People's Republic of China opened up a broad road of socialism for all ethnic groups in our country. Over the past ten years, the vast majority of ethnic minority areas have thoroughly completed democratic reforms, basically completed socialist transformation, and realized the people's commune system. At the same time, socialist construction has also made great progress, and people's lives have been significantly improved. Especially in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, ethnic minority areas also launched a great leap forward in the national economy. Compared with 1957, the total industrial output value increased by 84%, and grain output increased by 41%. This year, 1959, there is no doubt that the leap forward will continue. He pointed out that socialism is the only path to common prosperity and development for all ethnic groups. Only by thoroughly realizing democratic reforms and socialist transformation can there be vigorous development of social productive forces and continuous improvement of people's lives, and the economic and cultural backwardness of various ethnic minorities left over from history can be gradually eliminated. We are pleased to see that the people of Tibet, after quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the reactionary upper-class elements, have also rapidly embarked on the path of democracy and socialism. We congratulate the great victory of the Tibetan people and believe that the working people of Tibet and patriots who support democracy and socialism will certainly be able to unite and realize this great task.

He said that socialism is the cause of hundreds of millions of people, and "we rely entirely on ourselves to save ourselves." Any method of charity is not feasible. Over the past ten years, in the democratic reforms, socialist transformation, and socialist construction in various ethnic minority areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have implemented the policy of putting politics in command and fully mobilizing the masses, so that the people of all ethnic groups have been liberated from all kinds of shackles, stood up, and formed a vigorous mass movement. This is not only the basic reason for the victory of the socialist cause in the past few years, but also the guarantee for greater victories in the future. At the same time, socialism and communism are the cause of liberating all mankind, and we must unite all those who support democracy and socialism to fight together. Over the past ten years, we have established the broadest united front in all ethnic groups and played an important role. In the future, we must continue to implement the united front policy and continue to unite all those who can be united to fight together.

Li Weihan said that on the basis of socialism, the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups have become more consolidated. The spirit of breaking down ethnic barriers, implementing large-scale cooperation, and learning from each other among the people of all ethnic groups is rising. At the same time, the areas where various ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities have realized regional autonomy, and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and the higher-level people's governments, they have exercised the right to be masters of their own affairs. The characteristics of the nation are fully respected and taken care of. Socialist culture, in various ethnic forms, is blooming in a hundred flowers, presenting a thriving and prosperous scene. Contrary to the reactionary slander that we "eliminate the nation," our country is in a period of prosperity and development for all ethnic groups.

Li Weihan finally emphasized that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the core of the unity of all ethnic groups in our country. The leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee of our continuous victory and the greatest happiness of the people of all ethnic groups. Let us unite more closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of the General Line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes and strive to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science culture. Strive for various ethnic minorities to gradually catch up with or approach the development level of the Han nationality.

Subsequently, Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the banquet. He warmly congratulated the people of all ethnic groups in our country for the great victories achieved in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and under the banner of socialism. He said that after quelling the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, the Tibetan people are carrying out the earth-shaking democratic reform movement with overwhelming momentum. Millions of monks and laypeople have stood up, straightened their chests, and bravely advanced to completely destroy the feudal serf system that has plagued the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and opened up a happy path for the Tibetan people to move towards socialism and communism.

Kang Gengcheng, head of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region visiting group, spoke on behalf of the visiting groups of various ethnic groups. He said that over the past ten years, our motherland has achieved brilliant victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the politics, economy, and culture of various ethnic minority areas have also developed rapidly with the great help of the Han elder brother. Socialist ethnic relations have been universally established and have penetrated into all aspects of our political and social life. All these achievements are the result of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, the great victory of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy.

In the future, we must continue to strengthen the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, hold high the banner of the People's Communes and the Great Leap Forward, develop social productive forces at high speed, and strive to build our motherland into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science culture in fifteen, twenty, or even longer years.

Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, Huang Yanpei and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, Phagpa La Qoigyai Gyaincain, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, also attended today's banquet.

Xu Bing, Secretary-General of the CPPCC National Committee, some standing committee members and deputy secretaries-general in Beijing, and group leaders and deputy group leaders of the ethnic and religious groups attended the banquet as hosts.

Also present at the banquet were Xie Fumin, Deputy Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, and Xie He, Deputy Directors of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, and others.

After the banquet, an evening party was held.

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会
    欢宴各民族观礼团和青年学习团负责人
    李维汉讲话指出社会主义是各民族共同繁荣和发展的唯一道路
    新华社5日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天下午举行宴会，招待各民族来京的观礼团和青年学习团的负责人。
    宴会由政协全国委员会副主席李维汉主持。会上充满了团结欢乐的气氛，宾主在席间频频为各民族祖国大家庭的繁荣举杯祝贺。
    李维汉在宴会上讲了话。他首先代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会，向来自全国各地的民族观礼团、青年学习团表示热烈的欢迎和祝贺。
    他说，十年前，在中国共产党领导之下，建立了中华人民共和国，从此结束了我国各民族遭受帝国主义和国民党反动集团压迫统治的历史；并且根本废除了民族压迫制度，建立了各民族间平等团结友爱合作的新关系。这是我国各民族由分裂和不平等进入统一和平等的历史转折点。
    李维汉说，中华人民共和国的建立，为我国各民族开辟了社会主义的康庄大道。十年来，绝大多数少数民族地区，彻底完成了民主改革，基本完成了社会主义改造，并且实现了人民公社化。同时社会主义建设也有了很大发展，人民生活有了显著的改善。特别是1958年，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，少数民族地区也展开了国民经济大跃进的局面，同1957年比较，工业总产值增长了84％，粮食产量增长了41％。今年，1959年，毫无疑问，会继续出现跃进的局面。他指出，社会主义是各民族共同繁荣和发展的唯一道路。只有彻底地实现民主改革和社会主义改造，才有社会生产力的蓬勃发展和人民生活的不断改善，历史上留下来的各少数民族经济和文化上的落后性，才能逐步地消除。我们高兴地看到，西藏人民在平息了反动上层分子发动的反革命叛乱以后，也迅速地走上了民主和社会主义的道路。我们祝贺西藏人民的伟大胜利，并且相信西藏的劳动人民和赞成民主和社会主义的爱国人士，一定能够团结一致，实现这个伟大任务。
    他说，社会主义是千百万群众自己的事业，“全靠自己救自己”，任何恩赐的办法都是不行的。十年来，我们在各民族地区的民主改革、社会主义改造和社会主义建设中都在共产党的领导下实行政治挂帅、充分发动群众的方针，使各民族人民从种种束缚下解放出来，站立起来，形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动。这不仅是过去几年来社会主义事业获得胜利的基本原因，而且是今后获得更大胜利的保证。同时，社会主义和共产主义是解放全人类的事业，必须团结一切赞成民主和社会主义的人们共同奋斗。十年来，我们在各民族建立了最广泛的统一战线，发挥了重要的作用。今后仍然要贯彻统一战线政策，继续团结一切可以团结的人们，共同奋斗。
    李维汉说，在社会主义基础上，祖国的统一和各民族团结更加巩固了。各民族人民打破民族壁垒，实行大协作和互相学习的精神日益高涨。同时，各少数民族聚居的地方实现了区域自治，在中央人民政府和上级人民政府的统一领导下，行使了当家作主的权利。民族的特点受到充分的尊重和照顾。社会主义的文化以多种多样的民族形式，百花齐放，呈现出欣欣向荣的繁荣局面，同反动派诬蔑我们“消灭民族”的胡说相反，我国正处在一个各民族繁荣发展的时期。
    李维汉最后强调指出：共产党和毛主席是我国各民族团结的核心。共产党和毛主席的领导是我们不断胜利的根本保证，是各民族人民最大的幸福。让我们更加紧密地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，高举总路线的旗帜，坚持大跃进和人民公社，为把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家而奋斗。为各少数民族逐步赶上或接近汉族的发展水平而奋斗。
    接着，西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼在宴会上讲话。他热烈祝贺我国各民族人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下和社会主义的旗帜下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利。他说，西藏人民在平息了西藏上层反动集团发动的反革命武装叛乱之后，正以排山倒海之势，进行着翻天覆地的民主改革运动。百万僧俗人民，站立起来，挺起胸膛，奋勇前进，要将几千年来苦害西藏人民的封建农奴制度彻底摧毁，开辟了西藏人民走向社会主义、共产主义的幸福大道。
    内蒙古自治区观礼团团长康根成代表各民族的观礼团讲话。他说，十年来，我们的祖国取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌胜利，各少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化也在汉族老大哥的巨大帮助下，得到了飞速的发展。社会主义的民族关系已经普遍建立，并且深入到我们政治生活和社会生活的各个方面。所有这些成就，都是中国共产党和各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席英明领导的结果，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。
    我们今后一定要继续在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，不断地加强祖国的统一和民族团结，高举人民公社和大跃进的旗帜，高速度发展社会生产力，争取在十五年、二十年或者更长一点时间内，把我们祖国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    国务院副总理、民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫，政协全国委员会副主席黄炎培、陈叔通，西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美都参加了今天的宴会。
    政协全国委员会秘书长徐冰，部分在京常务委员和副秘书长，民族、宗教组组长和副组长都出席宴会作陪。
    出席宴会的还有，全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民，民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春、萨空了、杨静仁、谢鹤等等。
    宴会结束后，并举行了晚会。
