    Contemporary Heroes
    Our Correspondent
    The top of the solemn and majestic Great Hall of the People sparkles with stars, and beneath it, a galaxy of socialist builders has gathered. In this people's palace, built with miraculous speed, sit new people who have created thousands of miracles. More than six thousand contemporary heroes from all over the country—outstanding representatives of socialist construction—are victoriously meeting here today; here they report to the Party and Chairman Mao on the brilliant achievements of the earth-shaking Great Leap Forward; here they demonstrate the great power of the mass movement for socialist construction that is creating history.

    A joyful and exciting moment has arrived: spotlights illuminate the vast hall into a sea of light, and soaring music rises; the leaders of the Party and the state are connected with the hearts of the six thousand advanced producers of socialist construction below the stage—no, and with the hearts of millions of masses who are creating high speed—water and milk are blended together. Faces full of joyful smiles; bursts of applause, louder than thunder, rolling across the sky; this is the sound of challenging the old world, the old system, the old forces; this is the sound of the Great Leap Forward and high speed; this is the sound of declaring the victory of the General Line. In just a few minutes, we see where our powerful strength lies, the source of our great victory: the Party, the leader, and the masses standing closely together.

    Old hero Meng Tai, sitting on the rostrum, applauded excitedly while smiling and looking at his close partners below the stage. What a magnificent lineup, what vigorous morale! Excitement and emotion lead people into memories. At the first National Congress of Heroes in 1950, there were more than 800 representatives. Since then, we have traveled a great voyage, our motherland has undergone tremendous development, and in proportion to this development, the ranks of advanced producers have grown unprecedentedly. In the first half of this year alone, 26 industries on the national industrial, capital construction, transportation, and trade fronts produced nearly 300,000 advanced collectives and more than 3.6 million advanced producers, including 540,000 women. This means that on these four fronts, more than one in every ten people is an advanced producer. In the first half of the year alone, they put forward 29.13 million rationalization proposals, and 13.05 million have already been implemented.

    Why shouldn't we be proud? We have a great, glorious, and correct Party, and we also have such a diligent and wise advanced team that is connected to millions of masses. What great ambitions cannot be realized? "If the sky has a handle, we can lift it; if the earth has a ring, we can pick it up!" We will definitely be able to turn China upside down! These standard-bearers of the Great Leap Forward come from every corner of our heroic motherland: rich plateaus, fertile grasslands, dense forests, vast Gobi deserts, surging rivers and oceans, and majestic mountains... They have personally witnessed the enormous changes that have taken place in every piece of land in the motherland. What did we originally have? Poverty, ruins, a few dilapidated blast furnaces, machines produced half a century ago, collapsed mines, bird nests on chimneys... But we need everything! Our trains are speeding forward, and in a few years, we have initially created a relatively complete iron and steel and machinery industrial system, and we have many new industrial sectors. The heroes of the iron and steel front sitting here, their starting point is no longer just Anshan, they also come from large iron and steel enterprises along the Yangtze River, at the foot of the Daqing Mountains, and under the Jiayuguan Pass, as well as from small blast furnace groups in Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guizhou. In attendance are not only old heroes like Ma Hengchang and Zhan Shuijing, but also young mechanical workers who manufacture jet airplanes, automobiles, tractors, heavy machine tools, precision instruments, and complete sets of industrial equipment, as well as production experts from small factories in many counties and communes. Employees of the petroleum front have walked out of Yumen and installed oil pump units in the Sichuan Basin, the Qaidam Basin, and Karamay, and many small oil refineries have also begun producing oil. Power stations and coal mines are no longer few and far between, but as numerous as stars. Skilled craftsmen who build factories and high-rise buildings from flat ground come from the interior and the border areas, from every piece of land in the motherland. We cannot describe in detail how trains are connected to the great southwest and northwest, nor can we introduce the great achievements of every advanced producer. Everything, everything of ours is very, very good!

    While cheering for victory, people will inevitably think of the decisive force in achieving victory—our great Party, our great leader Chairman Mao. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who, based on the aspirations of the people, formulated a general line that could fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the people. The people grasped the general line in their own hands, making it an unstoppable and powerful force, pushing our country onto the road of high-speed progress. Please take a look, the group led by Comrade Ma Wanshui of the Longyan Iron Mine has overfulfilled its plan every month for the past ten years, creating the highest record in the tunneling of ferrous metals nine times. Now the tunneling efficiency has increased 180 times compared with 1949, becoming a red flag that "has been the champion for ten years and has reached the peak nine times" and never fades. Comrade Peng Shihua, the representative of the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, will tell you: In 1958, this plant used old and outdated blast furnaces for production, and the annual output was equivalent to 5.7 times the output of the First Five-Year Plan. It sounds unbelievable at first, but it is true. The sixty-six workers of the Sun Defu Drilling Team of Yumen Oilfield only spent four years, eight months, and twenty-five days drilling eleven oil wells, with a footage of 27,700 meters, which is 2,200 meters more than the total footage of drilling wells in Yumen Oilfield in the ten years before liberation. Can these be believed? The facts cannot be disbelieved. All of this is built on a powerful force: everyone understands how important speed is to us.

    Old hero Zhan Shuijing has come to Beijing again. He is a standard-bearer who always holds high the red flag. He is a lathe worker at Dalian Shipyard. From 1947 to now, eleven years and eleven months, he has not produced any defective products or rework, and in the extraordinary Great Leap Forward of 1958, he completed twenty months of work, and this year he completed one year and one day of work in six months. The representatives of thousands of advanced collectives and advanced producers who attended the meeting are all people like Zhan Shuijing who are racing against time.

    High speed requires people to have a noble communist style. Tao Demei, deputy director of the boiler branch of the Huainan Power Plant in Anhui, is not only a model of safe production for ten years, but also a hero who sacrificed himself for the public to rescue boilers. On September 12 this year, a valve on the boiler was not closed properly, and a large amount of water and gas leaked out, which was about to affect power generation, affect the electricity consumption of various factories, and may damage the boiler. At this time, the room was filled with steam as hot as seventy or eighty degrees Celsius, and nothing could be seen. He rushed into the house without hesitation and went to close the valve in the water mist. His hands, face, and arms were burned, and he fainted, but he finally eliminated the major failure that could have occurred, ensuring the normal operation of the generator and ensuring that many factories and mines continued to produce as usual. Zhao Mengtao, a female spinning machine operator in the fine yarn workshop of the Northwest No. 1 Cotton Mill in Shaanxi Province, has consistently overfulfilled the state plan every month for the past seven years, and has personally taught her experience to twelve workers. She always leaves the difficulties to herself and gives the convenience to others, helping others to catch up with herself. She has more than once left her car and worked on the fine yarn car that she thought was the most difficult to manage, and exchanged cars with others seven times.

    When people understand that "walking on two legs" is to strive for speed, the enthusiasm for running industry in a big way has been brought into play unprecedentedly. In 1958, these figures were particularly exciting throughout the country: in the steel industry, the total volume of small blast furnaces built and put into production reached 43,000 cubic meters, which is almost twice the total volume of large blast furnaces, the ironmaking capacity increased by more than 10 million tons, and the medium and small coal mines built and put into production had a total coal mining capacity of about 19 million tons, accounting for two-thirds of the annual new coal mining capacity, and the installed capacity of the medium and small power stations built was 475,000 kilowatts, accounting for 26% of the annual new installed capacity. Tens of millions of people went to the mountains to run various enterprises, making the industrial land of the motherland appear full of stars. The Manghe Iron and Steel Plant in Jiyuan County, Henan Province, has thirty-five small blast furnaces in production, which drive one hundred and eighty-five small coal, electricity, machinery, and other factories and mines, making Jiyuan County a scene of great industrial prosperity. They used the steel they refined to manufacture and repair 130,000 agricultural implements of various kinds, which supplied the countryside and promoted a bumper harvest in agriculture. Yang Junhai, the representative of this factory, sat with the representatives from large enterprises to share the joy of victory.

    If we want to win time and move forward at high speed without stopping, we must open the gate of technology. Isn't Zhang Jiazong from Xuzhou Heavy Machinery Factory a hero in this regard! The forging team he led has created and improved 570 sets of tools and fixtures in the past seven years, completing 25 years of work in seven years. The Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Young Shock Team in Beijing also completed the first five-year plan one year and three months ahead of schedule on the basis of creating and innovating more than 20 kinds of tools. During the construction of the Great Hall of the People, they fought hard for nine days and nights, binding 680 tons of steel bars, which is equal to one and a half times the workload completed in the whole year of 1957.

    Among the heroes, some come from ordinary positions. They did not produce a ton of steel, a machine tool, or a kilowatt of electricity, but they also put their efforts into producing more steel, more machine tools, and more electricity. Our cause cannot do without them: storekeepers, cooks, barbers, postmen, cleaners, nursery workers... Li Rong, a letter sorter at the Harbin Post Office, has only been working for three years. This is an extremely ordinary position, but she has extraordinary intentions and creations. When she learned that a construction blueprint sent by a central department to a factory in Harbin was delayed for 18 days due to the wrong sorting by the sorter, which affected 18 days of construction work, she became particularly motivated. An idea occupied her: "Sorting letters is also a major national affair!" In the past two years, she has sorted 4 million letters to the whole country without a single mistake. The efficiency of sorting letters has increased from 3,000 pieces per hour to 8,500 pieces, and she has created a new record of 10,588 pieces. She has become a high-quality and fast flag for sorting letters nationwide. How many things need to be completed through letters, and great time has been gained because Li Rong distributed them quickly, these achievements are often not easy to be noticed!

    When we were advancing at high speed, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists wanted to set up reefs on our road forward. Their sinister faces have been exposed, and they have run into walls. Under the guidance of the Party's General Line, our socialist construction ship will continue to sail forward quickly, like in the past, taking advantage of the long wind and breaking through thousands of miles of waves. Today, more than 6,000 advanced producers are solemnly taking an oath here. Although there are still storms at sea, we will definitely and resolutely steer the revolutionary ship to our great destination—a modern and great socialist power.

    当代英雄
    本报记者
    庄严雄伟的人民大会堂的顶部繁星闪耀，在它的下面，云集着社会主义建设的群星。在这用奇迹般的速度建成的人民宫殿里，坐着创造了万千奇迹的新人。来自全国各地的六千多名当代英雄——社会主义建设的杰出代表，今天，在这里胜利会师；在这里向党和毛主席汇报震撼山河的大跃进的光辉成就；在这里展示创造历史的社会主义建设群众运动的伟大力量。
    一个欢乐的激动人心的时刻到了：聚光灯把广阔的大厅照耀成一片光海，乐声高昂升起；党和国家的领导人和台下六千多社会主义建设的先进生产者，不，和创造高速度的千百万群众的心连在一起了，水和乳交融在一起了。一张张欢笑动人的脸；一阵高过一阵的掌声，像巨雷滚过天空；这是向旧世界、旧制度、旧力量挑战的声音；这是大跃进和高速度的声音；这是宣告总路线胜利的声音。就在这短短几分钟的时间里，我们看见了我们强大力量的所在，我们伟大胜利的源泉：党、领袖和群众亲密地站在一起。
    老英雄孟泰，坐在主席台上，一面兴奋地鼓掌，一面微笑着望着台下亲密的伙伴。多么雄壮的阵容，多么旺盛的士气啊！兴奋和激动会把人领进到回忆里。1950年的第一次群英会，到会的有八百多代表。从那时起，我们走过了一段伟大的航程，我们的祖国有了巨大的发展，和这个发展成正比，先进生产者的队伍也空前地壮大了。今年上半年，全国工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸战线上的二十六个行业，就涌现出先进集体近三十万个，先进生产者三百六十多万人，其中有五十四万妇女，这就是说，在这四条战线上每十个多人就有一个先进生产者。只是上半年，他们提出的合理化建议就有二千九百一十三万件，并且有一千三百零五万件已经实现了。
    我们为什么不自豪呢？我们有伟大、光荣、正确的党，我们又有这样一支勤劳智慧联系着千百万群众的先进队伍，有什么雄心大志不可以实现呢？“天有把，我们举得起；地有环，我们提得起！”我们一定能把中国翻转过来！这些大跃进的旗手，来自我们英雄祖国的各个角落：富饶的高原、膏腴的草地、浓密的森林、辽阔的戈壁、波浪汹涌的江河海洋、巍峨的崇山峻岭……。他们亲眼看见祖国每一块土地有了怎样巨大的变化。我们原来有些什么呢？贫困、废墟、孤伶伶的几座破烂高炉、半世纪以前出厂的机器、倒塌的矿井、烟囱上的鸟巢……。可是我们什么也需要呵，我们的列车加速奔驰，我们在几年的时间内，初步造就了一个比较完整的钢铁和机械工业体系，我们有了许多新的工业部门。在这里坐着的钢铁战线上的英雄，他们的出发地已不只是鞍山，他们还来自扬子江边大青山麓和嘉峪关下的大钢铁企业，还有来自山东、安徽、江苏、河南、四川、甘肃、贵州等的小高炉群。在座的不但有马恒昌、詹水晶这样的老英雄，而且有制造喷气飞机、汽车、拖拉机、重型机床、精密仪器、成套工业设备的青年机械工人，有来自许多县和公社的小型工厂的生产能手。石油战线的职工，已走出玉门，在四川盆地、柴达木草原、克拉玛依安装了吸油机，而许多小型炼油厂也开始生产石油了。电站、煤矿早已不是屈指可数，而是如同繁星了。让平地升起工厂、高楼的能工巧匠，来自内地和边疆，来自祖国的每一块土地。我们无法详细描述火车是怎样通向大西南、大西北的，更无法介绍每个先进生产者的丰功伟绩。我们一切的一切都是很好很好很好的！
    在欢呼胜利的时候，人们必然会想起取得胜利的决定性力量——我们伟大的党，我们伟大的领袖毛主席。是党和毛主席，根据人民群众的愿望，制定了一条能够充分动员人民积极性主动性的总路线，人民群众把总路线掌握在自己手里，使它成为不可阻挡的强大力量，把我们的国家推上了高速度前进的道路。请看看吧，坐在龙烟铁矿的马万水同志领导的小组十年来月月超额完成计划，九次创造了黑色金属掘进的最高纪录，现在掘进效率比1949年激增一百八十倍，成为一面“十年居冠军，九次登高峰”永不褪色的红旗。本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂的代表彭石华同志会告诉你：1958年，这个厂用老掉了牙的高炉进行生产，一年的产量相当于第一个五年计划产量的五点七倍，骤听，好像无法相信，然而却是事实。玉门油矿孙德福钻井队的六十六名工人，只用了四年零八个月又二十五天的时间，钻成了十一口油井，进尺二万七千七百米，比玉门油矿解放前十年钻井进尺的总和还多二千二百米。这些能令人相信吗？事实是无法不相信的。这一切都建筑在一个强大的力量上：我们每个人都懂得速度对我们有多大的意义。
    老英雄詹水晶又一次来到北京了。这是个永远高举红旗的旗手。他是大连造船厂的车工，从1947年到现在十一年又十一个月没有出过废品和返手活，并且在特大跃进的1958年完成了二十个月的工作量，今年又用六个月的时间完成了一年零一天的工作量。到会的成千个先进集体的代表和先进生产者代表，都是像詹水晶一样赶在时间前面的人。
    高速度，需要人们具有高尚的共产主义风格。陶德美，安徽淮南发电厂锅炉分场副主任，不但是十年来的安全生产模范，也是舍己为公抢救锅炉的英雄。今年9月12日，锅炉上有一个阀门没有关好，大量向外漏水漏气，眼看着要影响发电，影响到各个工厂的用电，而且有可能烧坏锅炉。这时，屋子里弥漫着热到摄氏七八十度的蒸汽，什么也看不见了。他毫不犹豫地冲进了屋子，在水雾中去关阀门。他的手、脸、胳臂被烫伤，他晕了过去，然而他终于排除了这次可能发生的大故障，保证了发电机正常的运转，保证了许多工厂、矿山照常生产。陕西省西北国棉一厂细纱车间女值车工赵梦桃，七年来一直是月月超额完成国家计划，并且亲手把自己的经验教会了十二个工人。她总是把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，帮助别人赶上自己。她曾不止一次地离开自己的车子，到认为最难管的细纱车上工作，有七次同别人换车子用。
    当人们懂得了“两条腿走路”就是争取速度以后，大办工业的干劲空前地发挥出来了，1958年，在全国范围内，这几个数字是特别令人兴奋的：钢铁工业，建成投入生产的小高炉总容积达四万三千立方米，几乎等于大高炉总容积的两倍，炼铁能力增加一千万吨以上，建成投入生产的中小型煤矿，总采煤能力约一千九百万吨，占全年新增采煤能力的三分之二，建成的中小型电站装机容量四十七万五千瓩，占全年新增装机容量的26％。几千万人走上山了，去办各种各样的企业。使祖国的工业大地上出现了满天星斗。河南济源县的漭河钢铁厂，有三十五座小高炉正在生产，它带动一百八十五个小型的煤炭、电力、机械等厂矿，使济源县出现了工业大繁荣的景象。他们用自己炼出的钢铁，制造和修配各种农具十三万件，供应了农村，促进了农业的大丰收。这个厂的代表杨俊海，和来自大企业的代表坐在一起共享胜利的欢乐。
    我们要想赢得时间不停地高速前进，就必须打开技术的闸门。来自徐州重型机械厂的掌家忠不正是这方面的英雄吗！他所领导的锻工小组，七年来创造、改进了五百七十套工卡具，用七年的时间，完成了二十五年的工作量。北京市张百发钢筋工青年突击队，也是在创造、革新二十多种工具的基础上提前一年零三个月完成第一个五年计划的。在建筑人民大会堂的日子里，他们苦战九昼夜，绑扎了六百八十吨钢筋，等于1957年全年完成工作量的一倍半。
    在英雄群中有一些是来自平凡的岗位上。他们没有生产一吨钢、一台机床、一度电，但是他们也为多产钢、多造机床、多发电投入了自己心血。我们的事业离不开他们：保管员、炊事员、理发员、邮递员、清洁员、保育员……。哈尔滨市邮局信件分拣员李荣，参加工作刚刚三年，这是一个极其平凡的岗位，可是她却有着不平凡的意愿和创造。当她知道有一次中央部门寄给哈尔滨某工厂一份施工图纸，因分拣员分错了，造成积压，影响了十八天的施工工作以后，她变得特别奋发了。一个思想占有了她：“分拣信，也是国家大事！”她两年来向全国分拣了四百万件平信，没有发生一个差错。分拣信的效率由每小时三千件，提高到八千五百件，并且创造了一万零五百八十八件新纪录。她成了全国分拣信工作的优质快速的旗帜。有多少件需要通过信件去完成的事情，由于李荣分发得快，而争取了大好时光，这些成绩往往是不容易受到人们注意的啊！
    当我们高速前进的时候，一小撮右倾机会主义分子，想在我们的前进道路上安下礁石。他们险恶的面貌被揭露了，他们碰壁了。在党的总路线指引下，我们的社会主义建设的大船，今后仍然会像过去那样，乘长风，破万里浪，飞快地向前行驶。今天，六千多名先进生产者，就在这里庄严誓师，尽管海上还有风浪，我们一定坚定地顽强地把革命的大船驶到我们伟大的目的地——一个现代化的伟大的社会主义强国。
