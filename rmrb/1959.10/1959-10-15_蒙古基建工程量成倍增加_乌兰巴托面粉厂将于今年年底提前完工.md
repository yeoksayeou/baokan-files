Ulaanbaatar, October 14th (From our correspondent) – A flour mill in Mongolia with an annual output of 25,000 tons of flour is under active construction in Ulaanbaatar. This is one of Mongolia's key projects this year and is expected to be put into production four months ahead of schedule at the end of this year.

The flour processing industry is a new enterprise in Mongolia. Starting in 1957, with the help of the Soviet Union, Mongolia began to build four flour mills in Ulaanbaatar and Bulgan provinces. Three mills with a total annual output of 9,000 tons of flour have been completed and put into production successively. After the largest Ulaanbaatar flour mill is put into production, Mongolia will be able to process and produce 34,000 tons of flour annually, which will play a significant role in fulfilling the task of meeting the people's needs with domestically produced flour in the next few years.

Construction of the factory began in October 1957. Now more than 80% of the factory building project has been completed, and more than 60% of the machine installation project has also been completed. At the end of August, the factory construction workers overfulfilled the monthly plan by 7%.

The area of construction projects to be completed by the Mongolian State Construction Committee this year is equivalent to three times that of 1958.

The state's planned investment in basic construction this year is more than 165 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency), an increase of 53% over last year.

　　蒙古基建工程量成倍增加
    乌兰巴托面粉厂将于今年年底提前完工
    本报乌兰巴托14日电　蒙古在乌兰巴托建设的一个年产二万五千吨面粉的面粉厂正在积极施工，这是蒙古今年重点工程之一，预计将提前四个月在今年底投入生产。
    面粉加工工业是蒙古的一项新企业，从1957年开始，在苏联帮助下蒙古开始在乌兰巴托和布拉干等省兴建四个面粉厂。共年产九千吨面粉的三个厂已先后竣工投入生产。在最大的乌兰巴托面粉厂投入生产后，蒙古每年就可以加工生产三万四千吨面粉，这对于实现在最近几年内以国产面粉满足人民需要的任务将起很大作用。
    工厂在1957年10月动工兴建，现在厂房工程已完成80％以上，机器安装工程也完成了60％以上。8月底工厂建筑工人们超额7％完成了月度计划。
    蒙古国家建筑委员会今年将完成的建筑工程面积相当于1958年的三倍。
    国家今年预定的基本建设投资额为一亿六千五百多万图格里克（蒙币），比去年增加53％。
