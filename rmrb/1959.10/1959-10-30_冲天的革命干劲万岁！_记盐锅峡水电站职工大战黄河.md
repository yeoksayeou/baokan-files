Long Live the Soaring Revolutionary Zeal!
    ——A Record of the Salt鍋峽 Hydropower Station Workers' Great Battle Against the Yellow River
    By our reporter, Lan Ping

    In the history of hydropower construction anywhere in the world, one could not find such a precedent: People, almost empty-handed, built a large-scale power station with an installed capacity of 380,000 kilowatts on a river with an average flow of 714 cubic meters per second. The reason why there was no precedent was that, in a short dry season, they rapidly passed the four major hurdles of cofferdam construction, foundation pit excavation, spillway dam pouring, and cutting off the rapid currents; because they mainly used sledgehammers, steel drills, carrying baskets, and handcarts to excavate 390,000 cubic meters of rock and pour 120,000 cubic meters of concrete. And in the construction team of more than 14,000 people who completed these tasks, there were only over 400 skilled workers and seven engineers with no experience in large-scale power station construction. This is a miracle. This miracle was created by the builders of the Salt鍋峽 Hydropower Station on the Yellow River.

    The Salt鍋峽 Hydropower Station is one of the key projects to be built in the overall plan for the comprehensive development and utilization of the Yellow River. It was originally planned to be built around 1962, but due to the rapid development of industrial construction in nearby Lanzhou, a huge amount of electricity was urgently needed, requiring the power station to start construction ahead of schedule. At that time, the matter arose suddenly, and the construction force was not available. In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation, the Salt鍋峽 workers decided to seize time and strive for speed, and immediately started the project in the spirit of overcoming difficulties and relying on their own efforts. After more than three months of brief preparation, on September 27, 1958, the sound of cannons roared, red flags fluttered, and amidst enthusiastic cheers, the Salt鍋峽 workers declared war on the surging Yellow River with fifty picks and five hundred iron shovels. At the groundbreaking ceremony, the builders swore to the Party: "Learn from the daring and hard-working communist style and heroic spirit of the 引洮 (Yin Tao River) project!"

    The first round of the Salt鍋峽 battle shook people. After the start of construction, it was first necessary to build a cofferdam on the right bank to separate the Yellow River in order to carry out the foundation excavation of the spillway dam. The originally designed wooden cage trestle type rockfill cofferdam required 2,500 cubic meters of wood and more than 40,000 cubic meters of stone, but at that time, even roof rafters were not available on the construction site, and it would take at least two months for the materials to be complete. After investigation and research, Yang Yimu, the Party Secretary of the Engineering Bureau, proposed to use the folk-popular straw and soil cofferdam. "Use wheat straw and loess to block two-thirds of the Yellow River?" Many engineering and technical personnel questioned in surprise. The first ideological confrontation between the two routes in the construction process thus unfolded. The Bureau Party Committee believed that the straw and soil cofferdam was the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people in fighting the Yellow River, and had been widely used as early as the mid-eighteenth century. Facts proved that this was a very successful experience. Therefore, it was decided to approve this suggestion and hire "local experts" who had long struggled with the turbulent waves of the Yellow River to provide guidance. Thousands of workers threw bundles of wheat straw into the turbulent torrent, adding soil to build a long embankment. The enraged Yellow River roared, rolling up waves and splashing white foam, and the flow rate increased sharply to five meters per second, impacting and tearing apart the advancing cofferdam. The wise masses immediately built a stone diversion dam upstream to reduce the flow rate. The straw and soil cofferdam was safe and sound, and extended forward at a rate of more than seventy meters per shift. In just twenty days, a straw and soil cofferdam 489 meters long and an average of 12 meters wide stably lay in the heart of the river. It not only did not use any wood or large quantities of stone, but also saved half of the construction time and 800,000 yuan in funds. The initial victory boosted people's fighting will and strengthened their confidence in "indigenous methods." Salt鍋峽 took a decisive first step.

    In the early stages of construction, the Salt鍋峽 workers had only three weapons: sledgehammers, steel drills, and carrying baskets; the only water pump and the broken car head driving it were borrowed. The period during the cutoff was the time when Salt鍋峽 had the most machinery, but the total number of large and small machines, including welding machines, small mine cars, and pneumatic drills, was only over 440, and more than one-third of them were temporary support from other departments. However, the Salt鍋峽 people did not fear or complain. With unparalleled heroic spirit, they vividly put forward the construction policy of "indigenous methods first, diversification of methods, combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and gradual mechanization." In implementing this "walking on two legs" policy, the key that the Bureau Party Committee firmly grasped was this: mobilize the masses and rely on the masses! A vigorous and surging mass movement was launched on the construction site. The broad masses of workers were high-spirited and enthusiastic. They not only supported the indigenous methods first, but also strived to create miracles with indigenous methods under extremely difficult material conditions. In the first few months, there were no electric lights on the construction site, so they lit gasoline lamps. When the kerosene supply for the gasoline lamps was insufficient, they lit torches. If torches were not enough, they relied on the moon, and the day and night battle never stopped; if there were no explosives, they boiled saltpeter to make them themselves. If the quantity was insufficient, they used fertilizer powder mixed with sawdust instead, adding salt and manure to save money. Even when there was no blasting power source, they would rather reduce entertainment and use the movie projector generator. When pouring the bottom holes of the spillway dam, it was the severe winter, and the mercury column dropped to minus eighteen degrees. Without boilers or heating pipes and other warming equipment, winter construction was still insisted on here. The construction site built fire beds, where northerners sleep, and the surface of the beds was paved with stone slabs for mixing concrete, and straw was woven into curtains to build construction warm sheds. Even the fuel burned in the "beds" and warm sheds was not coal, but withered grass that the workers climbed mountains and ridges to cut. No difficulty could intimidate the builders of Salt鍋峽, and no force could extinguish the ardent desire to order the Yellow River to generate electricity quickly!

    The weakness of the technical force on the construction site was also simply unbelievable. The average level of the steel workers was 0.3, there were only 19 scaffolders in total, less than half of the concrete workers were formal technicians, and there was not even a single technician among the carpenters. These skilled workers added up to less than 3% of the total number of workers. But their answer was: "Learn while building, and study hard without getting tired!" The technical level of the workers improved day by day through hard study. A large number of farmers who had just come to the construction site from the fields quickly mastered advanced technology. No one could deny that they were excellently undertaking and completing such arduous tasks. A fact of particular significance is that people were not satisfied with the efficiency brought about by backward tools. It was these construction novices of large-scale hydropower stations who posted more than 210,000 big-character posters, put forward a large number of various technical innovation and technical revolution measures and rationalization proposals. The entire construction site formed a high-efficiency movement combining hard work and clever work that spread to every corner. Carrying poles and baskets were put down, and people used various vehicles and new tools they made themselves; a scientific construction method suitable for the characteristics of the construction site was established, and the production order was well-organized and efficient. After the method of softening rocks with vinegar and alkali water was universally promoted, on the hard riverbed of levels 9 to 12, the number of holes drilled by two people per shift increased from 90 centimeters to 5 meters, and a new record of 12.6 meters per shift was created. In terms of pouring concrete, after implementing the method of multi-opening working faces for three-dimensional parallel cross-operation, the amount poured rose from several hundred cubic meters per day to more than two thousand cubic meters. After seizing time to gradually add some construction machinery and achieving "combining indigenous and foreign methods," construction efficiency increased even more.

    In Salt鍋峽's advance through wind and waves, the Party Committee was the strong helmsman. The heads of Party committees at all levels shared weal and woe with the workers and masses, deeply entered the front line of the site and battle for a long time, and personally took command to lead the masses to fight the Yellow River. When the project entered a tense juncture, the general headquarters on the construction site was bustling during the day and brightly lit at night. From the secretary of the Bureau Party Committee and the director to the chief engineer, they all personally worked day and night on the construction site, and stipulated tasks, divided areas of responsibility, and assigned responsibility at each level. In order to increase the working faces for concrete pouring, the construction body was covered with "full house red" scaffolding as dense as a spider web. Every time a horse track was added, from the secretary of the Party committee to the group leader, they would collectively study it carefully and personally test it several times on the spot to check whether it was suitable. In order to cut off the flow on time before the flood season, the Party leaders at all levels and all the cadres fought together with the workers and masses all night long, using the measures of concentrating leadership, manpower, and material resources to concentrate forces to fight an annihilation war. As a result, it took only forty days to prepare, and in thirty-six hours, the roaring Yellow River was cut off, creating a miracle again.

    After the mass movement to oppose rightism, encourage hard work, and launch a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy was launched, the construction speed of Salt鍋峽 increased exponentially. By the end of September, in the one year of construction, the excavation of stone had reached 66% of the total, and the pouring of concrete had reached more than one-quarter. Currently, the spillway dam is as high as 54 meters, and the plant's water-retaining dam is also towering in the heart of the river. It is expected to be completed and generate electricity next year. Such a construction speed is first-class in China and unprecedented in the world. The policy of "indigenous methods first" and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods won time and achieved high speed; if we had waited step by step for the objective material conditions to be available, the design drawings would not be fully produced by now, and the entire project would take at least four years.

    Due to Salt鍋峽's creative construction methods and leap-forward speed, many people had doubted its engineering quality. The facts are the most convincing. The spillway dam and construction cofferdam of Salt鍋峽 were severely tested by four consecutive extraordinary flood peaks in July and August. At the end of July, the maximum daily rainfall reached 76 millimeters, accounting for more than one-third of the annual average rainfall. The sand and gravel on the mountain peaks on both sides of the canyon were washed down like a flood. The flow of the Yellow River surged to 3,590 cubic meters per second, while the spillway dam and cofferdam tightly held the violent torrent and stood as firm as a mountain. Not long ago, a working group from the Central Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power made a special inspection of the quality issue, and the final comment was: it meets the design requirements. Where is the secret? The builders of Salt鍋峽 replied: "Quality is guaranteed by people. Even any modern machinery must be mastered by people!"

    The victory of Salt鍋峽 is the victory of the mass line working method that combines the Party's centralized leadership and mass movement; it is the victory of the Party's policy of promoting both foreign-style production and indigenous-style production at the same time; it is the victory of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The example of the Salt鍋峽 construction site prominently demonstrates the brilliance of the Party's entire set of "walking on two legs" policies! (Attached picture)

    冲天的革命干劲万岁！
    ——记盐锅峡水电站职工大战黄河
    本报记者　蓝坪
    在世界任何水电建设史上，都找不到这样一个先例：人们几乎赤手空拳地在平均流量七百一十四秒公方的河流上，建设装机容量达三十八万瓩的大型电站。其所以没有先例，是因为在短短的一个枯水期内，以飞跃的速度闯过建筑围堰、基坑开挖、溢流坝浇筑和截断激流四大关；是因为主要用大锤、钢钎、抬筐和手推车，挖掉三十九万公方岩石和浇筑了十二万方混凝土。而完成这些任务的一万四千余人的施工队伍中，只有四百多名技术工人和七名毫无大型电站建设经验的工程师。这是一个奇迹。这个奇迹是黄河上的盐锅峡水电站的建设者创造的。
    盐锅峡水电站，是黄河综合开发利用规划中要建设的枢纽工程之一。原计划在1962年左右兴建，但由于附近的兰州工业建设突飞猛进发展，迫切需要巨量电力，要求电站提前动工。当时，事起仓促，施工力量是不具备的。为适应大跃进形势的需要，盐锅峡的职工决定夺取时间争取速度，以克服困难自力更生的精神立即上马。经过三个多月的短暂准备，1958年9月27日，炮声轰鸣，红旗招展，在热烈的欢呼声中，盐锅峡职工以五十把洋镐五百张铁铣，就向巨涛翻腾的黄河宣战了。开工典礼上，建设者们向党宣誓：“学习引洮（河）工程的敢想敢干的共产主义风格和英雄气概！”
    盐锅峡上阵交手的头一个回合，就震动了人们。开工后，首先需要在右岸筑围堰隔开黄河，以便进行溢流坝基础开挖。原设计的木笼栈桥式堆石围堰，需要两千五百方木材和四万多方石料，而工地上当时连根盖房屋的木椽也没有，要等材料齐备起码得两个月。工程局党委书记杨一木经过调查研究，提出改用民间流行的草土围堰。“用麦草黄土来堵塞三分之二的黄河？”许多工程技术人员吃惊地质问。施工过程中两条路线的首次思想交锋，就这样展开了。局党委认为：草土围堰是我国劳动人民与黄河搏斗的智慧结晶，远在十八世纪中叶就已普遍应用，事实证明这是一项极成功的经验。因此决定批准这个建议，并且聘请了久与黄河惊涛骇浪作斗争的“土专家”来进行指导。几千工人把成捆的麦草抛入汹涌的洪流，加土筑成长堤，激怒的黄河暴跳着，卷起浪头喷溅着白沫，流速猛增至每秒五米，冲击和撕裂着步步进占的围堰。智慧的群众马上在上游砌起一条堆石挑水坝，以降低流速。草土围堰安然无恙了，并且以每班七十多米的速度向前延伸。总共不过二十天，一条长四百八十九米、平均宽达十二米的草土围堰就稳定地横卧河心。它不仅完全没用木料和大批石料，而且节省了二分之一的建筑时间和八十多万元资金。旗开得胜鼓舞了人们的斗争意志，而且坚定了人们对“土法”的信心，盐锅峡迈出了具有决定性的第一步。
    施工的前阶段，盐锅峡职工手里只有三种武器：大锤、钢钎和抬筐；仅有的一部抽水机和带动它的破汽车头，还是借来的。到截流期间是盐锅峡拥有机械最多的时期，但包括像电焊机、小矿车、风钻等这些东西在内的大小机械，总共也不过四百四十余件，而其它部门临时支援的要占三分之一以上。但是，盐锅峡人没有畏惧也没有叫苦，他们以无比豪迈的气概生动地提出了“土法先上马，方法多样化，土洋相结合，逐步机械化”的施工方针。在贯彻这个“两条腿走路”的方针中，局党委狠狠抓住的关键就是这样一条：发动群众，依靠群众！工地上掀起了如火如荼浪潮澎湃的群众运动。广大职工斗志昂扬干劲冲天，他们不仅拥护土法先上马，而且力争在物质条件极端困难的情况下，用土法创造奇迹。工地在最初的几个月还没有电灯，就点起汽灯，汽灯的煤油供应不及，就点火把，火把不够就靠月亮，夜以继日的战斗绝不停止；没有炸药，就自己熬硝制造，数量不足，就用肥田粉掺锯末代替，加上食盐和粪便来节约，甚至在没有爆破电源时，宁可少娱乐去拿放映电影的发电机使用。浇筑溢流坝底孔时，正是严寒的冬季，水银柱下降到零下十八度，在没有锅炉和暖气管等保暖设备的情况下，这里照样坚持冬季施工。工地砌起北方人睡觉的火炕，炕面铺上石板用来搅拌混凝土，用麦草编成帘子搭起施工暖棚。甚至在“炕”里和暖棚里燃烧的都不是煤，而是工人同志们攀山越岭割来的枯草。任何困难都唬不倒盐锅峡的建设者，任何力量都扑不灭这种喝令黄河迅速发电的炽烈愿望！
    工地技术力量的薄弱，也是简直令人难以置信的。钢筋工的平均水平为零点三级，架子工总共只十九名，混凝土工中正式技工不足一半，而木工中连一个技工也没有。这些技术工人加起来还占不到职工总数的3％。但他们的回答却是：“边学边建，苦学不厌！”工人技术水平在苦钻苦学中日益提高；大批刚从田野上来到工地的农民迅速掌握了先进技术，谁都不能否认他们出色地担负和完成着这样艰巨的任务。具有特殊意义的事实是：人们不满足落后工具所带来的效率状况。正是这些大型水电站的建设新手，贴出二十一万多张大字报，提出大批各种各样的技术革新与技术革命措施和合理化建议，整个工地形成遍及各个角落的苦干与巧干相结合的高工效运动。扁担筐子放下了，人们使着自己制造的各种车辆和新工具；科学的适合工地特点的施工方法建立起来了，生产秩序井然而富有效率。普遍推广用醋和碱水软化岩石的方法后，在九至十二级的坚硬河床上，双人每班打眼由九十公分提高到五米，还创造出每班十二点六米的新纪录。浇筑混凝土方面执行多开工作面进行立体平行交叉作业法后，由每天浇筑几百方上升到两千多方。在夺得时间逐步增添部分施工机械和作到“土洋并举”以后，施工效率更是节节上升。
    盐锅峡乘风破浪地前进中，党委是坚强的航手，各级党委负责人与职工群众同甘苦共患难，长期深入现场和战斗第一线，亲自挂帅率领群众向黄河搏斗。在工程进入紧张关头时，工地总指挥部里，白天熙来攘往，夜晚灯火通明，从局党委书记、局长到总工程师，都亲自在工地昼夜值班，并且规定任务，分片包干，层层负责。为使混凝土浇筑增加工作面，施工体上搭着密如蛛网的“满堂红”脚手架，每增一条马道，从党委书记到小组长，总是集体仔细研究，并亲自实地试验几遍，检查是否合适。为了抢在洪水期前按时截流，党的各级负责人和全体干部更是和职工群众一起通宵奋战，用领导、人力、物力三集中的措施，集中力量打歼灭战。结果只用四十天准备，在三十六个小时中就截住了咆哮的黄河，再次创造出奇迹。
    反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起新的增产节约运动高潮的群众运动开展以后，盐锅峡的施工速度更成倍地增长，到9月底为止的施工一年中，开挖石方已达总量的66％，混凝土浇筑达四分之一以上，目前溢流坝已高达五十四米，厂房挡水坝也已高耸河心，预计明年即将竣工发电。这样的建设速度在国内是第一流的，在世界上是没有的。“土法先上马”和土洋结合的方针，夺得了时间取得了高速度；如果按部就班等待客观物质条件具备，到现在设计图纸还不会完全产生，而全部工程至少得在四年以上。
    由于盐锅峡这种创造性的施工方法，这种跃进的速度，许多人曾怀疑过它的工程质量。事实是最有说服力的。盐锅峡的溢流坝和施工围堰，在7至8月份连续受到四次特大洪峰袭击的严峻考验。7月底最大日降雨量达七十六公厘，占年平均雨量三分之一以上，峡谷两岸山峰的砂石被冲击得像洪水般哗哗直流，黄河流量猛增至三千五百九十秒公方，而溢流坝和围堰紧紧擒勒着暴烈的浊流，安如泰山巍然矗立。不久前，中央水电部工作组专就质量问题作了检查，最后评语是：合乎设计要求。秘密在哪里呢？盐锅峡的建设者回答说：“质量是由人来保证的。即使任何现代化机械也必须由人来掌握！”
    盐锅峡的胜利，是党的集中领导与群众运动相结合的群众路线工作方法的胜利；是党的洋法生产和土法生产同时并举方针的胜利；是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的胜利。盐锅峡工地的事例，突出地显示出党的一整套“两条腿走路”方针的光辉灿烂！（附图片）
