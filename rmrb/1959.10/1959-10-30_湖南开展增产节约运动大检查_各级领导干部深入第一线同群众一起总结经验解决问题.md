Hunan Launches Extensive Production Increase and Economy Drive Inspection
Leading Cadres at All Levels Go Deep into the Front Lines to Summarize Experiences and Solve Problems with the Masses

    (By our newspaper) To promote the early and comprehensive overfulfillment of this year's plan and prepare for continued leaps forward next year, Hunan Province is currently conducting a massive production increase and economy drive inspection. Inspection teams from the Provincial Party Committee, led by responsible comrades from the Provincial Party Committee, have arrived in various regions. Party committees at the prefectural, municipal, and county levels have also organized inspection teams of hundreds of thousands of people, including commune and team cadres, and are conducting comprehensive inspections of agriculture, industry, capital construction, transportation, finance, and trade. This inspection has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses on all fronts, pushing the current production increase and economy drive to a new, deeper, and more vigorous stage.
    Since the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed and implemented throughout the province, new atmospheres have emerged on all fronts. The autumn harvest and planting work has been carried out quickly and well, new records in the production of steel, iron, and coal have continuously emerged, and work in all areas is progressing rapidly.
    In order to push the current movement to a new, deeper, and more vigorous stage, ensure the comprehensive, over-fulfilled, and early completion of this year's leap forward plan, and on this basis, propose plans for continued leaps forward next year and deploy next year's work, the Provincial Party Committee decided on October 6th to quickly organize a province-wide inspection of the production increase and economy drive. Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, serves as the general head of the delegation, and six secretaries and one member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee serve as the heads of the sub-delegations, having successively arrived at seven prefectural committees to begin the inspection.
    The inspection teams work in a way that combines top-down and point-to-surface approaches. Responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels personally go deep to conduct systematic investigations and research, summarize experiences more deeply, and solve practical problems in their work. When Zhang Pinghua inspected work at the Henglongqiao Commune in Yiyang, which had achieved a bumper harvest of late rice, he used a rice cutter to cut rice and a rice thresher to thresh rice together with cadres and commune members. He immediately summarized the high efficiency and good quality of the rice thresher and rice cutter together with cadres and commune members, and proposed that they be widely promoted and used in the harvesting of late rice. At the same time, he also pointed out that the problem of grain scattering with the rice thresher should be solved, and the treadle should be improved. Inspired and guided by the Provincial Inspection Team, the cadres and masses of this commune are focusing on current production, promoting new agricultural tools, and are determined to complete this year's winter tasks such as fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, and deep plowing with greater enthusiasm. On the basis of having achieved a thousand-jin yield per mu of rice in the whole commune this year, they will strive for a greater harvest of rice next year. Zhou Hui, Deputy General Head of the Provincial Inspection Team, Head of the Second Sub-Delegation, and Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, helped the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee summarize the experience of the commune rectification pilot project, and praised the model deeds of the workers of the Xiangxiang Xikou Reservoir in constructing the project under difficult conditions and completing the task excellently. This inspired the morale of the masses and further strengthened the confidence and determination of cadres and the masses to meet new victories next year on the basis of this year's great leap forward. The Fourth Sub-Delegation learned of the difficulty of insufficient steel for the construction of the Hengyang Baiyutan Hydropower Station, and promptly studied solutions and was extremely concerned about the lives of the migrant workers, who were very touched. The Third, Seventh, and Fourth Sub-Delegations of the Provincial Inspection Team promptly convened on-site meetings during in-depth inspection work, helping the local areas summarize and exchange high-yield experience of double-cropping late rice. The local Party committees decided to expand the area of double-cropping rice next year, and to thoroughly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase. They will carry out farmland capital construction this winter to ensure increased grain production next year.
    The in-depth inspection work has greatly inspired the morale of the masses. A greater production upsurge has been launched throughout the province. The daily output of pig iron in Shaoyang Prefecture created a new record of 865 tons on October 15th, and the current daily output is stable at around 850 tons. As of October 15th, Hengyang City had completed a total output value of various products of more than 292.44 million yuan, accounting for 84.8% of the total annual plan. The area for harvesting oil tea and tung oil in Qianyang Prefecture increased sharply from more than 350,000 mu before the inspection to more than 800,000 mu.

    湖南开展增产节约运动大检查
    各级领导干部深入第一线同群众一起总结经验解决问题
    本报讯　为了推动提前全面超额完成今年计划，准备明年继续跃进，湖南省各地正在深入开展一个规模巨大的增产节约运动大检查。由省委负责同志亲自率领的省委检查团已经到达各地。各地、市、县委并组织了包括社、队干部参加的数十万人的检查团，正在对农业、工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸等各方面的工作进行全面大检查。这次检查大大鼓舞了各个战线上干部和群众的干劲，把当前的增产节约运动推向更加深入、更加高涨的新阶段。
    自从党的八届八中全会决议精神在全省各地传达贯彻以来，各个战线都出现了新的气象，秋收秋种工作搞得又快又好，钢、铁、煤等的增产新纪录不断涌现，各方面的工作都在快步前进。
    为了把当前运动推向更加深入更加高涨的新阶段，保证今年的跃进计划全面超额提前完成，并在这个基础上，提出明年继续跃进的规划，部署明年的工作，省委在10月6日决定迅速在全省范围内组织一次增产节约运动的大检查，由省委第一书记张平化同志任总团长，六位书记和一位省委常委任分团团长，已先后到达七个地委开始检查。
    检查团与各地、市、县委检查团采取上下结合、点面结合的方式进行工作，各级党委负责同志亲自深入下去进行系统的调查研究，更深入地总结经验和解决实际工作中的问题。张平化同志在益阳晚稻获得大丰收的衡龙桥公社检查工作时，和干部、社员们一道用割禾器刈禾，用打稻机打谷子，当即和干部、社员们共同总结了打稻机、割禾器工效高、质量好的好处，提出在收割晚稻中要大量推广使用，同时也指出打稻机撒粒的问题要加以解决，踩板还要改良。这个公社的干部和群众在省检查团的鼓舞和指导下，大抓当前生产，推广新式农具，决心以更大干劲，完成今年冬季积肥、水利、深耕等任务，在今年全社已实现稻谷千斤丰产社的基础上，明年要争取稻谷更大的丰收。省委检查团副总团长、第二分团团长、省委书记周惠同志帮助湘潭地委总结了整社试点经验，表扬了湘乡溪口水库职工在艰苦的条件下施工，出色地完成任务的模范事迹。这鼓舞了群众的斗志，更加坚定了干部、群众在今年大跃进的基础上迎接明年新的胜利的信心与决心。第四分团了解到衡阳白鱼潭水电站施工钢材不足的困难，及时研究了解决办法，对民工的生活也极为关心，民工们很受感动。省委检查团第三、第七、第四分团在深入检查工作时都及时召开了现场会，帮助当地总结交流了双季晚稻高产经验，当地党委决定在明年扩大双季稻面积，很好地贯彻执行农业增产“八字宪法”，今冬即作好农田基本建设，保证明年粮食增产。
    检查工作的深入进行，大大地鼓舞了群众的斗志。全省各地都掀起了一个更大的生产高潮。邵阳专区的生铁日产量在10月15日已创造日产八百六十五吨的新纪录，目前日产量稳定在八百五十吨左右。衡阳市到10月15日止，全市已完成各种产品产值达二亿九千二百四十四万多元，占全年计划总产值的84.8％。黔阳专区收摘油茶、油桐，由检查前的三十五万多亩激增到八十多万亩。
