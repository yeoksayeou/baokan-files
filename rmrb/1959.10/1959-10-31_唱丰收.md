Singing of the Harvest

The fields are full, the rice ears shimmer gold,
Even in drought years, late rice gives off a special fragrance,
Girls push the rice harvesting machines,
Like ships sailing across the ocean. (Liu Donglian, Baishazhou, Yuanjiang, Hunan)

There are fertile fields on the high mountains,
Late rice sways among the white clouds,
Golden millet can't be carried away,
Borrow the Milky Way to transport the grain. (Hu Zhengshan, Xinhua, Hunan)

Water has a source, and trees have roots,
This year's bumper harvest has a reason,
The Party's leadership points in the right direction,
The commune has planted the roots of happiness. (Fan Jinchuan, Yinjiaxi People's Commune, Dayong, Hunan)
