    Xinhua News Agency Authorized Statement
    The Chinese People are Friendly to the People of the United Arab Republic and Asian and African Countries; the United Arab Republic Newspaper's Attempt to Spread Rumors and Sow Discord Will Not Succeed
    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Xinhua News Agency statement:
    In recent days, newspapers of the United Arab Republic have published a large number of fabricated rumors about China. In particular, the Cairo "Al-Ahram" newspaper, in its report on October 3, insisted that "the Chinese government prohibits the telegram of the United Arab Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs from being handed over to the chargé d'affaires stationed in China," and that the Chinese authorities are "conducting internal and external surveillance" of the United Arab Republic Embassy. The newspaper claimed groundlessly on October 4 that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had requested the ambassador to the United Arab Republic to fly back to Beijing "to report the situation to the government." Although government leaders or government officials from Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Morocco, and other countries attended the National Day reception at the Chinese embassy, the newspaper insisted that the capitals of Arab countries "boycotted" the Chinese embassy's National Day activities. The Cairo "Al-Gomhuria" also fabricated rumors that China was "concentrating troops on the Indian border to intimidate India" and "launching battles" on the Burmese border, etc.
    Xinhua News Agency is authorized to state that the above-mentioned statements by "Al-Ahram" and others are completely without factual basis and are complete fabrications. The Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China has always enjoyed the diplomatic treatment it deserves in China and has never been subjected to any interference or obstruction. The Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Republic has not been recalled to report on the situation. China has never intimidated or launched battles against India or Burma. The Chinese people are friendly to the people of the United Arab Republic and the people of Asian and African countries. The attempt by newspapers of the United Arab Republic to fabricate rumors to sow discord will certainly not succeed. We advise the newspapers of the United Arab Republic to value the friendship between China and the United Arab Republic and stop spreading rumors as soon as possible.

    新华社奉命声明
    中国人民对阿联和亚非各国人民是友好的，阿联报纸散布谣言、挑拨离间的企图不会得逞
    新华社8日讯　新华社声明
    最近几天来，阿拉伯联合共和国报纸上大量刊登了对于中国的捏造的谣言，尤其是开罗“金字塔报”在10月3日的报道中硬说“中国政府禁止把阿联外交部的电报交给驻中国的代办”，中国当局对阿联使馆“进行内外监视”。该报10月4日毫无根据地说中国外交部要求驻阿联大使飞返北京“向政府提出形势报告”。尽管伊拉克、也门、苏丹、摩洛哥等国政府领导人或政府官员出席了中国使馆的国庆招待会，这家报纸却硬说阿拉伯各国首都都“抵制”中国使馆的国庆活动。开罗“共和国报”还造谣说中国在印度边界“结集军队，恐吓印度”，在缅甸边境上“发动战斗”等等。
    新华社奉命声明，“金字塔报”等的上述说法，完全没有事实根据，是彻头彻尾的捏造。阿联驻华使馆一向在中国享受到它应有的外交待遇，从未受到任何干涉和阻挠。中国驻阿联大使并没有奉调回国报告形势。中国对印度、缅甸从来没有进行恐吓和发动战斗的事。中国人民对阿联人民和亚非各国人民是友好的。阿联报纸这种捏造谣言以进行挑拨离间的企图，是一定不会得逞的。奉劝阿联报纸，应以中阿友谊为重，赶快停止造谣吧。
