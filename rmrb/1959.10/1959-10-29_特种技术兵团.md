    Special Technology Corps
    Zhang Jing
    The Wuxi Municipal Organization for Technology Innovation Promotion Group has spurred a city-wide wave of innovation, representing an excellent method for organizing technological collaboration to promote the technological revolution. The Secretary of the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee called it a "Special Technology Corps," a fitting analogy.
    It's called a "Special Technology Corps" because it differs from typical technical groups in its organization; its primary mission is to promote the current technological innovation movement. How does it promote this? It gathers a large number of technicians, experienced master craftsmen, and production experts, who delve into the field, offer firsthand accounts, provide on-the-spot consultations, and resolve issues on the spot—the most effective form of promotion. This approach complements on-site meetings and, in some aspects, is more flexible and in-depth than typical on-site meetings. While holding on-site meetings is a good way to promote, the experiences shared often carry a directional quality or have general significance for a particular department or industry. How these experiences are specifically applied across different departments varies. Those with similar conditions or strong motivation may promote them effectively, while those with different conditions or lacking motivation may promote them poorly. The Technology Innovation Promotion Group precisely fills this gap; it can identify key production areas based on the different conditions and characteristics of various industries and factories, and solve technical bottlenecks in a way that suits local conditions. Particularly for technically complex products and factories with weaker technical capabilities, collaboration between the promotion group and the factory's technicians and workers can greatly shorten the exploration process, greatly enhance confidence in overcoming difficulties, and accelerate production progress.
    The Technology Innovation Promotion Group not only facilitates collective wisdom, absorbs advanced experiences from all sides, and allows for timely summarization and dissemination, but it is also a thought-promoting and motivation-promoting group. Because its activities are not fixed in a specific area or factory, but rather take a mobile approach, and because its members are all experienced production experts and technicians, they observe, analyze, and compare wherever they go, distinguishing between the advanced and the backward, and understanding the reasons behind each. Through the external force of the promotion group, combined with the internal drive and perseverance of the factory's workers, it is possible not only to use the experiences of advanced factories to promote backward factories but also to discover the potential of backward factories, help them boost their confidence, and strive for advancement. At the same time, it can remind certain factories that consider themselves advanced to wake up from their complacency, continue to exert their energy, and continue to move forward.
    The central aspect of the fourth quarter's production increase and conservation movement in factories and mines is to launch large-scale mass-based technological revolution and technological innovation. How to improve this year based on the experience of last year remains to be created by various regions; however, the Wuxi Technology Innovation Promotion Group is a good experience for promoting the movement.

    特种技术兵团

    无锡市组织技术革新促进团，推动全市掀起了一个人人搞革新的浪潮，这是组织技术大协作促进技术革命运动的一个好方法。无锡市市委书记说它是“特种技术兵团”，这个比喻是再恰当不过的了。
    说它是“特种技术兵团”，是因为它不同于一般的技术团体的组织，它的使命首先就是为了促进当前的技术革新运动。怎样来促进呢？它集中了大批技术人员、有经验的老师傅和生产能手，深入现场，现身说法，就地会诊，就地解决，这就是最有效的促进。这种方式是现场会议的补充，某些方面比一般的开现场会议更灵活更深入。开现场会固然是一种很好的促进方法，但在现场会上推广的经验往往是带有方向性的，或者是对某一部门某一行业有普遍意义；这些经验如何在各部门中具体运用，情况就不完全相同了。条件相似的或干劲足的推广得好些，条件不同或者干劲不足的可能就推广得差些。而技术革新促进团恰恰就弥补了这个不足，它可以根据各行各业各工厂的不同条件不同特点，具体地找出生产关键，因地制宜解决技术上的关键问题。特别是对技术上比较复杂的产品，和技术力量比较薄弱的工厂，通过促进团和本厂技术人员与工人的协作研究，就可以大大缩短摸索的过程，大大增强克服困难的信心，加速生产的进度。
    技术革新促进团不仅便于集思广益，吸收各方面的先进经验，及时总结，及时传播，而且同时它又是一个思想促进团，干劲促进团，由于它的活动不是固定的在某一个地区或某一个工厂，而是采取流动的方式，而且它的成员又全是有经验的生产能手和技术人员，他们到一处，看一处，看得多，看得深，什么是先进的，什么是落后的，为什么先进，为什么落后，一比就比较出来了。通过促进团的外力、工厂内部职工群众的干劲和钻劲相结合，不仅可以用先进厂的经验去促进落后的工厂，同时也可以发现落后厂的潜力，帮助落后的工厂提高信心，力争上游。同时也可以提醒某些自以为先进的工厂，及时从骄傲自满的状态中清醒过来，继续鼓足干劲，继续前进。
    第四季度厂矿增产节约运动的中心环节就是大规模地开展群众性的技术革命和技术革新，今年如何在去年已有的经验基础上提高一步，还有待各地创造；然而无锡市技术革新促进团这一组织却是推动运动的一个好经验。
