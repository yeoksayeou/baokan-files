    Dollar Crisis
    Editor's Note: The October 19th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" published an article entitled: "Another Threat to the Dollar Now Exists - Why. The dollar, which has been supreme for years, has suddenly become a troublesome currency. Here's why." The article laments the dollar's plummeting value, arguing that reducing foreign "aid," having foreign countries share military expenditures, restricting foreign investment, and devaluing the dollar are all unworkable, concluding that "there seems to be no way out at present." Excerpts are translated below:
    Overseas income is decreasing, while expenditures are increasing. Spending on foreign aid and defense has truly caused financial exhaustion. Capital outflows reach $4.5 billion annually. What's the way out? There seems to be no way out at present.
    At the end of 1957, less than two years ago, the United States' gold reserves were $22.9 billion. The actual annual capital inflow to the United States was more than $400 million. Therefore, the dollar had the highest credibility in the world.
    Today, the United States' gold reserves are less than $19.7 billion. The annual capital outflow from the United States is $4.5 billion. If this rate continues, the amount of debt that foreign countries can demand the United States to redeem in gold will soon exceed the gold reserves. Trade Recession
    How could the United States' position have changed so significantly? The answer is simple: the United States sells less abroad and buys more. More and more American goods are being squeezed out of the world market due to high prices. American industries are channeling capital to foreign countries to establish factories in order to take advantage of cheap foreign labor. At the same time, the U.S. government continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars abroad on defense and foreign aid.
    In the past, huge trade surpluses could offset foreign aid expenditures and military program costs. This is no longer the case.
    Call for Help
    It is against this background that U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson requested on September 29th that Britain, Germany, France, and other allies bear more of the expenses for aiding underdeveloped countries. He hinted that they might have to bear more of the defense costs in Europe. He also called for lowering the current barriers to imports of American goods.
    The American call for help has received only a limited response. In general, other countries are concerned about America's difficulties and express sympathy for America's problems, but tend to believe that the solution to these problems rests entirely with America itself. What to do?
    With the dollar in increasingly greater difficulty, U.S. officials are studying courses of action to take in the future when needed.
    Reduce aid? Foreign claims on the dollar are growing at a rate of about $4.5 billion per year. If the dollars currently spent abroad on aid were spent domestically, or completely eliminated, there would still be a deficit of about $2 billion. But reducing aid is something President Eisenhower opposes. Share military expenditures?
    U.S. overseas troops spend about $3 billion abroad each year. Now some suggest that foreign countries bear part of these expenses to help save the dollar. But no one seriously believes that other countries will agree to share these costs. Most foreign governments also face pressure to reduce their own defense spending. Restrict investment?
    U.S. private industry invests about $2 billion annually overseas. These dollars flow abroad to set up factories or buy corporate stock, thereby taking advantage of cheap labor overseas. If the government wished, it could prevent capital outflow. There is no indication that the government has any such intention. On the contrary, there is currently great pressure to increase U.S. capital outflow. Dollar devaluation?
    The United States adopted the method of dollar devaluation in 1934, when it raised the price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce. Now some suggest raising the price again to $50 or $55.
    The prospect of taking this step still seems remote. One reason: if the United States lowers the value of the dollar, other countries will immediately follow suit and lower the value of their currencies by the same ratio. Thus, all efforts would be in vain. Lower prices? What does it mean? It's simple: American goods must once again be more competitive in order to sell smoothly on the world market. This also means that the rise in American prices must be stopped. If this trend is to be reversed, there must be more opposition to wage increases. And the government must stop fueling inflation by increasing the money supply, which the government increases due to budget imbalances.
    Currently, the United States' financial situation is not as strong as it used to be. Countries that were on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of World War II seem to have more stable financial situations than the United States in some cases.

### 美元危机

专栏：外论摘要

    美元危机
    编者按　10月19日的“美国新闻与世界报道”刊载了一篇文章，题目是：“现在存在着对美元的另一威胁——为什么。这些年来一直至高无上的美元突然变成了一种麻烦的货币。下面是原因所在。”这篇文章哀叹美元的身价惨跌，认为减少对外“援助”、让外国分担军事开支、限制向国外投资、实行美元贬值都是行不通的，结论是“目前看不出有什么出路”。现摘译如下：
    国外的收入在减少，开支却在增加。对国外援助和防务的支出已经真正造成财政上的枯竭。流出的资本达到每年四十五亿美元的程度。出路何在呢？目前还看不出有什么出路。
    在1957年底，即不到两年前，美国的黄金储备为二百二十九亿美元。每年实际流入美国的资本为四亿多美元。因此美元具有世界上最高的信誉。
    今天，美国的黄金储备不到一百九十七亿美元。每年流出美国的资本为四十五亿美元。如果按照这个速度继续下去，外国可以要求美国兑给黄金的债权数额不久就将超出黄金储备数额。贸易衰退
    美国的地位怎么会有这种显著的改变呢？答案很简单，美国对国外卖得少，买得多。越来越多的美国货在世界市场上因价格过高而被排挤。美国工业把资本流向外国，建立工厂，以利用廉价的外国劳工。同时，美国政府继续在防务和援外方面在外国花成亿的美元。
    过去一个时候，巨额的出超可以抵消援外开支和军事计划费用。现在情况不是那样了。
    呼吁帮助
    就在这个背景情况下，美国财政部长安德逊9月29日要求英德法和其他盟国多负担些援助不发达国家的经费。他暗示，可能要它们多负担些欧洲的防务经费。他还要求降低目前对输入美国货的障碍。
    美国要求帮助的呼吁只获得有限的反应。总的说来，其他国家关心美国的困难，并且对美国的问题表示同情，但是趋向于这种看法：这种问题的解决完全要靠美国自己。怎么办？
    在美元陷入越来越大的困难的情况下，美国官员正在研究一些在未来需要时采取的行动方针。
    减少援助？外国对美元的债权正在以每年大约四十五亿美元的速度增长着。如果把现在援助方面花在国外的美元改而花在国内，或者完全取消，这样仍然有大约二十亿美元的差额。而减少援助是艾森豪威尔总统所反对的。分担军事开支？
    美国海外驻军每年在国外大约花三十亿美元。现在有人建议，外国负担这方面的部分开支，以帮助拯救美元。但是没有人认真地认为其他国家会同意分担这些费用的。大部分外国政府也面临着要降低它们自己的防务开支的压力。限制投资？
    美国私营工业对海外投资每年约为二十亿美元。这些美元流向外国设厂或购买企业股票，从而可以利用海外的廉价劳动。如果政府愿意的话，它可以阻止资本输出。现在并无迹象表示政府有这方面的任何想法。相反地，目前有很大的压力要求增加美国资本输出。美元贬值？
    美国在1934年曾采用美元贬值的办法，那时把黄金价格从每盎斯二十·六七美元提高到三十五美元。现在有人建议把价格再提高到五十美元或五十五美元。
    看来采取这个步骤的前景仍然很遥远。其中有一个原因：如果美国降低美元价值，其他国家也会马上接着以同样比率降低它们的货币价值。于是全功尽弃。压低物价？它的含义是什么？那很简单，美国货必须再度更富于竞争性，以便在世界市场上顺利销售。这也意味着美国物价上涨必须制止。如果要改变这个趋势，就要更多地反对增加工资。而且政府必须停止用增加货币供应的办法滋长通货膨胀，政府所以增加货币供应是由于预算不平衡而引起的。
    目前，美国财政状况并不像过去那样雄厚了。在第二次大战结束时处于破产边缘的国家，在某些情况下，其财政状况看来比美国还要稳定。
