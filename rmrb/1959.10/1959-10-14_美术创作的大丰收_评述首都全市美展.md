A Bountiful Harvest of Art Creation
　　——A Review of the Capital's Citywide Art Exhibition
　　Zhao Fengchuan
    The Beijing Municipal Art Exhibition is another gift from the art world to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country!

    The exhibition features more than 460 works including traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, prints, cartoons, sculptures, and arts and crafts. Participants include professional painters, amateur artists, workers, farmers, soldiers, and outstanding folk artists. It is particularly worth noting that many young painters have emerged in the exhibition. These painters (accounting for 20% of the participants) have joined the ranks of this art exhibition with a new and robust attitude, adding infinite vitality to the exhibition.

    This exhibition shows that under the encouragement and guidance of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, an unprecedented prosperity has emerged in the capital's art creation. The works here not only have different themes, but also different forms and styles. They each have their own characteristics and emit brilliant light.

    There are many good works in the exhibition.

    When it comes to good paintings, everyone has their own opinions, and we cannot force uniformity. However, a good painting should not only explain something, but should be able to reflect the spiritual outlook of things through vivid artistic images, thereby possessing a kind of infectiousness and giving the audience spiritual encouragement and emotional inspiration. Based on this requirement, the following works are worth introducing.

    One is the oil painting "Forging Worker" (Mao Fengde). The characters in this painting are vividly portrayed. The two workers holding tongs are portrayed very vividly and powerfully. Although it is a back view, you can see that their enthusiasm is very high and their confidence is very high. It seems like you can even hear the sound of the steam hammer. The good thing about this painting is that it does not explain how workers forge steel, but expresses the workers' strong will and soaring enthusiasm through artistic images. It can give people great emotional encouragement.

    Another oil painting "Visiting Mom" (Ma Zhensheng). This painting is not large in size, and it does not attract much attention at first glance, but if you look at it carefully, it will attract you like a magnet. It depicts: in a lush green cabbage field, the women who are harvesting vegetables are resting, and the kindergarten children come to the field to sing to their mothers. Five children stand in a row, opening their small mouths, some singing innocently, some singing seriously, and some singing very mischievously; their expressions are all different, they are all so innocent, interesting, lively and lovely, and even the mothers around them are so happy that they can't close their mouths.

    In terms of technique, it is painted a bit simply, but the characters are portrayed very vividly; the painting is full of rich life sentiment. Look, the commune has established kindergartens, and a large area of cabbage is being harvested. The mothers are working without any worries, and their children come to sing to them after work; what a happy and beautiful scene! It is conceivable how high the enthusiasm of the masses will be. This is art, and it is also praise. This kind of praise does not dryly preach to people, but captures the moving scenes in life and infects people through vivid and flesh-and-blood artistic images, making people unable to help but admire and believe.

    The large oil painting "Swimming Across the Yangtze River" (Li Xiushi) is a work with high ideological and artistic qualities. In a horizontally long picture, the turbulent Yangtze River is surging, a long bridge spans the north and south, and Chairman Mao stands at the bow of the ship, looking into the vast river surface. His calm demeanor and great spirit are portrayed quite vividly. In addition to the above works, there are of course many other good paintings. For example, "Discharged from Hospital," "New Seedlings," and "Warm Afternoon" are all better works.

    In terms of traditional Chinese paintings, there are even more masterpieces. Huang Zhou's "Singing and Dancing" uses bold and powerful brushstrokes to depict the happy and joyful life of the Uyghur people after the harvest. The image is beautiful, and the picture is full of musical rhythm and emotion, which makes people feel a kind of joyful and encouraging energy when they see it.

    "Deep Affection Penetrates Three Feet of Snow" (Cao Yanlu) and "Sending Firewood" (Xu Yun) are both good works. The plot and characters in the paintings are vivid and moving.

    In this exhibition of traditional Chinese paintings, figure paintings have greatly increased, which is a good phenomenon. In traditional Chinese painting creation, figure painting has always been a weak link, but now it has grown up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and most of them are young people's works; although they are still a bit tender, the new seedlings are just growing, showing a vigorous momentum, which cannot but be said to be an extremely gratifying thing.

    Traditional Chinese landscape and flower-and-bird paintings have always had a strong foundation and prosperous creation. This time there are even more original new works. For example, Hu Peihang's "Yangshuo Peaks," Qin Zhongwen's "Yueyang City," Li Keran's "Meijiang Bridge," and Zhou Yuanliang's "Spring Dawn in the Mine" are some of the more exquisite works.

    "Spring Dawn in the Mine" is a landscape painting that uses traditional techniques to reflect real life. It not only depicts the beautiful scenery of the motherland, but also reflects the new face of socialist construction. The factories, trains, workers, and sheep in the painting are not isolated embellishments, but organically constitute the new rising scene of the motherland's construction.

    This painting illustrates an important issue, that is, how to use tradition to reflect real life. On this issue, Chinese painters have been working hard to explore and create experience in recent years. Some have made faster progress, while others have been slower. If Chinese painters want to paint a new life and a new look, their own thinking must first be new and liberated, and they must have a high degree of love for the construction of the motherland. Without this, it is impossible to paint new things. As for how to express it, it is necessary to master traditional techniques well. Therefore, the learning and mastery of traditional techniques is a very important thing. However, some people have mastered traditional techniques but do not know how to use them, or even dare not use them; they are afraid of deviating from tradition if they make slight adaptations. The creation of "Spring Dawn in the Mine" has opened a path from this dead end. He does not regard tradition as dead, but regards it as a living method that is ever-changing. In order to express a new life and new ideas, he dares to take and dares to abandon. In order to express the richness of the mine, the texture of the stones can be like this or like that, and it is never bound by tradition. In this way, traditional techniques are combined with life, and the effect is not only harmonious, but also rich and novel, promoting the old and bringing forth the new, and in some aspects developing tradition.

    Other works such as prints, cartoons, and sculptures also have many works with novel content and high quality. It is worth mentioning some mass art and folk artists' works. The works exhibited by amateur mass authors, including workers, farmers, and soldiers, are not many, but they are also very brilliant. In these works, if you browse through them, a strong atmosphere of life will come to your face. A simple, vivid, and distinct style makes people feel cordial and excited.

    Among the arts and crafts, in addition to exquisite ivory carvings and jade carvings, the dough figurines of the old artist Tang Zibo are works of considerable artistic value. He can skillfully shape various vivid characters, which are not more than an inch, and each one is lifelike, beautiful and lovely, and is praised by the audience.

    The clay sculptures of folk artists Wang Ersheng and Liu Zhimin are also the development of traditional folk art. Wang Ersheng's "Before Steelmaking" and Liu Zhimin's "Singing the Great Leap Forward" both use traditional folk methods to create new character images.

    Judging from the overall exhibition situation, it also illustrates two important issues: one is that it illustrates that the development and improvement of art creation, the mastery of technology and artistic cultivation are of course important, but more important is life. Many of the works exhibited this time are full of the atmosphere of life, reflecting the people's life and struggle in all aspects. This is because during the Great Leap Forward last year, many painters went to the countryside and factories to live with the workers and peasants. After labor, their ideological understanding changed, so the quality of their works improved, the characters were flesh and blood, and their faces were renewed.

    Secondly, it also shows that the capital's art creation can achieve such achievements because under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, art workers have implemented the Party's general line, mustered their energy, and worked hard to create. In a short period of time, a flourishing scene of a hundred flowers blooming has emerged; the creation of old painters has become more active, and a large number of young painters have emerged, forming a more壮da and united art team.

　　美术创作的大丰收
　　——评述首都全市美展
　　赵枫川
    北京市美术展览会，是美术界向伟大的建国十周年的又一献礼！
    展出的作品有国画、油画、版画、漫画、雕塑及工艺美术等四百六十余件。参加的人，有专业画家，业余美术者，有工人，农民，战士及优秀的民间艺人。特别值得注意的，展览会上涌现了不少青年画家的作品，这些画家（占参加人数的百分之二十）以新生、健壮的姿态参加了这次美展的行列，给美展增添了无限的生命。
    这次的展出表明了，在党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针鼓舞和指导之下，首都的美术创作已出现了空前的繁荣。这里的作品，不但有各种不同的题材，也有各种不同的形式和风格。他们各具特色地放出灿烂的光彩。
    展出中有许多好作品。
    说到好画，各人有各人的看法，不能强求一致。但是一幅好画，应该不仅是说明了什么，而是能够通过生动的艺术形象，反映事物的精神面貌，从而具有一种感染力，给观众以精神上的鼓舞和情感上的振奋。根据这个要求，值得介绍的有下面一些作品。
    一幅是油画“锻工”（毛凤德），这幅画人物形象塑造生动，两个持钳操作的工人，表现得十分生动有力，虽然是个背影，却看得出他们的干劲鼓得很足，信心很高，好像连汽锤的声音也要听到一样。这幅画的好处，就在于它不是说明工人如何锻钢，而是通过了艺术的形象，表现了工人的坚强意志和冲天的干劲。能给予人们情感上极大的鼓舞。
    另一油画“慰问妈妈”（马振声），这幅画的尺寸不大，乍看去并不惹人注目，但若约略细视，就像吸铁石般的吸住了你。画的是：在一片翠绿的白菜地里，收菜的妇女们正在休息，幼儿班的娃娃来到地头给妈妈唱歌，五个儿童站成一行，张着小嘴，有在天真的唱，有在认真的唱，还有很顽皮的唱；神气各有不同，都是那么天真有趣，活泼可爱，连周围的妈妈们也乐得合不上嘴了。
    论技法，画得有些简单，但人物刻划却很生动；画中洋溢着浓郁的生活情调。请看，公社成立了幼儿班，大片白菜正在丰收，妈妈们无牵无挂的在劳动之后，来了自己的娃娃给唱歌；这是多么幸福美好的光景啊！可以想像到群众的干劲是会怎样高涨的。这是艺术，也是歌颂，这种歌颂，不是干巴巴的向人说教，而是抓住了生活中的动人情节，通过有血有肉的艺术形象来感染人，使人看了不能不倾心信服。
    大幅油画“万里长江横渡”（李秀实）是思想性和艺术性较高的作品。在一个横长的画面里，波澜壮阔的江水在汹涌奔腾，一带长桥横贯南北，毛主席站在船头，举目远视辽阔的江面。安详的风度和伟大气魄，表现得颇为生动。除了上述作品外，好画当然还有不少。如“出院”“新苗”“温暖的下午”等，也都是较好的作品。
    在国画方面，佳作更是不少。黄胄的“载歌行”泼辣有力的笔法画出了维吾尔族人民丰收后的幸福和愉快的生活。形象优美，画面富有音乐的节奏感情，使人看了，能引起一种欢乐鼓舞的劲儿。
    “深情融透三尺雪”（曹延路）与“送柴”（徐云）等都是较好的作品，画中的情节和人物形象生动感人。
    在这次国画作品中，人物画大大增多了，这是一个好现象。国画创作里，人物画向来是薄弱的一环，现在却像雨后春笋般地生长了起来，而且大都是青年的作品；尽管还有些嫩，但新苗初长，即呈现一派朝气蓬勃之势，这不能不说是一件极可庆幸的事。
    国画的山水、花鸟，向来力量较厚，创作繁盛。这次独创的新作就更多了。如胡佩衡的“阳朔奇峰”、秦仲文的“岳阳城”、李可染的“眉江大桥”与周元亮的“矿山春晓”等就是一些较精的作品。
    “矿山春晓”是一幅山水画，他是运用传统的技法，反映了现实的生活。既画出了祖国河山的秀丽，又反映了社会主义建设的新面貌。画中的工厂、火车、工人、羊群等，不是各自孤立的点缀品，而是有机地构成了祖国建设新升的景象。
    这幅画说明着一个重要的问题，就是如何运用传统反映现实生活的问题。在这个问题上，几年来国画家们都在努力摸索，创造经验。有的进展快一点，有的慢一些。国画家要想画出新生活，新面貌，首先自己的思想要新，要解放，对祖国的建设要有高度的热爱。没有这，就不可能画出新的东西。至于如何表现，那就须要很好掌握传统技法。因此，传统技法的学习和掌握，就是十分重要的事。但是，有些人掌握了传统技法而不会运用，甚至不敢运用；稍加取舍，就怕脱离了传统。而“矿山春晓”的创作，正是从这死胡同打开了一个门径。他不把传统看成死的，而把它看作千变万化的活方法，为了表现新的生活，新的思想，敢于有所取，也敢于有所舍。为了表现矿山的丰富，石头的皴法，可以这样，也可以那样，决不为传统所拘。这样，传统的技法就和生活结合起来，其效果不但谐调，而且丰富新颖，推陈出新，在某些方面又发展了传统。
    其他作品如版画、漫画、雕塑等，都有不少内容新颖质量很高的作品。值得一提的是一些群众美术及民间艺人的作品。群众业余作者，包括工人、农民和战士，他们的画展出虽不算多，但是也很精彩。在这些作品中，如果你稍加浏览，浓厚的生活气息便会迎面扑来。一种朴实，生动，鲜明的风格，使人感到亲切和兴奋。
    在工艺美术品中，除了精致的牙刻，玉雕之外，老艺人汤子博的面人是有相当艺术价值的作品。他能巧妙地塑造出各种形象生动的人物，小不盈寸，而且个个都是逼真肖似，优美可爱，为观众称赞不已。
    民间艺人王二生和刘芝民的泥塑，也是民间传统艺术的发展。王二生的“炼钢之前”与刘芝民的“歌唱大跃进”，都是运用了民间传统方法创造了新的人物形象。
    就从整个展出的形势看，它还说明了两个重要的问题：一个是，说明了美术创作的发展和提高，技术的掌握和艺术的修养固然重要，但更重要的是在于生活。这次展出的作品，很多是充满着生活气息，从各个方面反映了人民的生活与斗争。这是由于去年大跃进时许多画家下乡下厂，和工农群众生活在一起，经过劳动锻炼思想认识有了变化，因而作品的质量提高了，人物形象有血有肉，面目为之一新。
    其次，还说明了首都的美术创作能够取得这样的成绩，是由于在党的领导下和“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针指导之下，美术工作者贯彻了党的总路线，鼓足干劲，艰苦创作。时间不长，就出现了百花盛开的繁荣景象；老画家们的创作更加活跃，年青画家大批涌现，形成了一支更加壮大和团结的美术队伍。
