The Great Revolution and Great Development of China's Education
Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng

The Speed and Scale of Education Development Over the Past Ten Years is Unprecedented

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are rapidly changing China’s "poor and blank" face with soaring enthusiasm. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has inspired the people of the whole country to seize one victory after another with high revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite creative power. Like other fronts, the education front has also experienced ten years of continuous revolution and continuous victory. Over the past ten years, millions of schools of all levels and types have been established on the vast land of the motherland, giving nearly 200 million people the opportunity to receive education. The broad masses of workers and peasants are arming themselves with socialist, communist ideas and modern scientific and cultural knowledge. A large contingent of intellectuals who are both red and expert is taking shape. The backward state of culture and education in old China is rapidly changing.

The speed and scale of the development of education in our country over the past ten years are unprecedented in history. By 1958, the number of students in schools at all levels and the multiples by which they increased compared to the highest year in old China were: preschool children reached 31 million, an increase of 237 times; primary school students reached more than 86 million, an increase of 2.6 times, and 85% of school-age children nationwide had been enrolled, and primary school education had been basically popularized in many cities and counties; secondary school students reached 10.52 million, an increase of 5.6 times; secondary technical school students reached 1.47 million, an increase of 2.8 times; college students reached 660,000, an increase of 3.2 times. 1958 was a year of great leap forward in education. In this year alone, the number of preschool children increased by 30 million; primary school students increased by 22 million, an increase of 34.4% over 1957; secondary school students increased by 5 million, an increase of 70%; college students increased by 220,000, an increase of 50%. Over the past ten years, colleges and secondary technical schools across the country have trained nearly two million senior and middle-level specialized talents for the country. At the same time, we have carried out the work of eliminating illiteracy among nearly 100 million young and middle-aged workers and peasants, and vigorously developed workers' and peasants' spare-time education. In 1958, 60 million people participated in literacy studies, and more than 30 million people participated in various spare-time school studies. Before liberation, very few children of workers and peasants were able to go to school. Since the founding of the country, the state has taken various measures to continuously expand the proportion of workers and peasants in schools at all levels. By 1958, more than 90% of children in kindergartens and primary schools were children of workers and peasants; workers and peasants accounted for more than 70% of secondary school students; and workers and peasants accounted for 48% of college students, of which new students in 1958 had risen to 62%.

The Huge Development of Education is the Result of Ten Years of Educational Reform, Especially the Great Educational Revolution and Great Leap Forward in 1958

The huge development of education in our country is the result of ten years of educational reform, especially the great educational revolution and great leap forward in 1958. After the founding of People's Republic of China, we took over all the schools in the country and abolished the fascist management system and secret service rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries over the schools. And we recovered the sovereignty of education from the imperialists. Then, in schools across the country, we carried out ideological and political education in Marxism-Leninism, combined with successive political movements to conduct ideological transformation of teachers and students, and criticized feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas and bourgeois ideas. In 1957, we also carried out rectification and the struggle against bourgeois rightists. While carrying out these ideological struggles, we inherited the fine traditions of education work in the past revolutionary base areas and learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's education cause, and carried out a series of reforms on the old education in accordance with the socialist education principles, and gradually established a socialist education system. Colleges and universities carried out departmental adjustment, greatly increasing the proportion of engineering and normal students. The proportion of engineering students in colleges and universities in the country accounted for more than 37% of the total number of students in the country, up from 17.8% in old China in 1947. Higher normal students have risen from 13.5% to more than 24%. In conjunction with the adjustment of departments, a method of training specialized talents was implemented, and more than 300 majors were set up in colleges and universities and secondary specialized schools. This is more adapted to the needs of national construction. The establishment and development of schools at all levels and types, in accordance with the spirit of the national chess game, combined with the characteristics of the region, was rationally deployed, greatly strengthening the colleges and secondary specialized schools in the interior, focusing on the development of secondary and primary education in industrial and mining areas, the vast countryside, and ethnic minority areas, fundamentally changing the deformed development of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China's education cause. While uniting, transforming, and educating the original teachers, new teachers were vigorously trained. The professional teacher team of schools at all levels has increased from 930,000 in 1949 to 2.5 million in 1958. Due to the continuous improvement of their political awareness and professional level, tens of thousands of model teachers and advanced workers have emerged on the education front.

In 1958, on the basis of the great victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front, under the illumination and encouragement of the Party's general line of building socialism, the people of our country realized a great leap forward in the national economy and realized the people's commune in the rural areas of the country. Under this new situation, the broad masses of workers and peasants urgently demanded to rapidly improve their cultural and technical level. In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses of people, in order to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution and accelerate socialist construction, and gradually realize the historical task of technological revolution and cultural revolution, the Party Central Committee issued "Instructions on Education Work," further clarifying the policy of education serving the politics of the proletariat and the combination of education and productive labor, and education work must be led by the Party. It was also emphasized that in order to develop education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must adopt the method of "walking on two legs," follow the mass line, and implement the whole Party and the whole people running schools. Once the Party's policy was put forward, it was immediately warmly supported by the broad masses of people. Thus, a mass movement with the combination of education and productive labor as the center of the educational revolution and the development of education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results developed vigorously throughout the country. This revolution thoroughly broke the influence of the old system and old ideas left over from bourgeois education. It further established the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism, gave full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running education, and enabled China's education to enter a new period of development.

The Central Issue of the Educational Revolution is to Combine Education and Productive Labor

Our education is one of the powerful tools of the proletariat to transform the old society and build a new society. As early as 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the general policy of cultural education in the revolutionary base areas lies in educating the vast working people with the spirit of communism, in making cultural education serve the revolutionary war and class struggle, in linking education with labor, and in making the vast Chinese people all people who enjoy civilization and happiness. In the past, the education in the revolutionary base areas and the national education since the founding of the country have basically followed this education policy. The purpose of the educational revolution since 1958 is to enable China's education to better serve socialist revolution and socialist construction, to eliminate all remnants of all exploiting classes and all exploiting systems, and to gradually eliminate the difference between mental labor and physical labor for the transition to a communist society in the future. To this end, our education work must implement the Party's education policy, "so that the educated can develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," cultivate new people who are both politically conscious and cultured, who can engage in both mental labor and physical labor, and gradually realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals.

The educational revolution has further resolved the relationship between education and politics. The bourgeoisie hypocritically flaunts "education for education's sake" and "students do not care about politics." We advocate that education must serve the politics of the proletariat, professional work must be combined with politics, and cultivate "both red and expert" talents. To this end, we take the ideological and political education of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's political work as the soul of all work in the school, and implement political command in the education of all cultural and scientific knowledge. Through systematic theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism, through the education of the political and economic situation and tasks of various periods, through participating in various political movements and practical exercises in productive labor, the teachers and students of the school have widely and conscientiously carried out socialist and communist ideological education. In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of teachers and students used the methods of airing their views, debating, stating the facts, reasoning, and criticism and self-criticism to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois view that professional work is divorced from politics, and greatly improved their socialist consciousness. The bourgeois individualism of pursuing personal fame and fortune, "only expert but not red," and taking the "white and expert road" was spurned by the broad masses of people. Arming themselves with the proletarian world outlook and "becoming intellectuals of the working class" has become the firm aspiration of the broad masses of teachers and students.

The central issue of the educational revolution is to combine education and productive labor. This is a profound revolution of great historical significance. Since mankind entered class society, a common feature of the education of all exploiting classes has been the separation of education from productive labor, using the spirit of despising physical labor and physical laborers, and using one-sided knowledge to educate the educated. Without thoroughly reforming this tradition of exploiting class education, without combining education and productive labor, the purpose of cultivating "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" cannot be achieved, and education cannot thoroughly serve the politics of the proletariat.

Through the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the teachers and students of schools at all levels have greatly improved their socialist consciousness and deeply felt the necessity of carrying out labor exercises. In the spring of 1958, under the call and leadership of the Party, the broad masses of students combined labor and study, and widely carried out activities to participate in productive labor, which quickly developed into a large-scale movement to go to factories and the countryside. Teachers and students in secondary schools and above went to factories, mines, construction sites, and rural areas in batches, ate, lived, and worked with workers and peasants, learned from workers and peasants, and exercised themselves in labor. Primary school teachers and students also widely participated in social public welfare labor within their capabilities. By the eve of the summer vacation, under the Party's call to "break superstition and liberate the mind" and under the impetus of the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, the broad masses of teachers and students carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and schools at all levels launched a upsurge in running factories and farms. Teachers and students took the initiative, overcame difficulties, and supported each other with factories. If the equipment was insufficient, they made do with whatever was available; if they did not understand the technology, they learned while doing it; and they answered those who watched coldly and ridiculed with practical achievements. In this way, often in a few days and nights, several or dozens of factories, workshops, and workshops, large and small, were set up in a school. At the same time as running factories and farms in a big way, normal colleges also ran workers' and peasants' spare-time schools in factories and rural areas, and medical colleges also helped workers and peasants to run hospitals and clinics. Everyone feels supremely honored to be able to serve the workers and peasants and contribute their share to the development of the national economy. In the movement of the whole people running iron and steel, teachers and students from schools in various places also launched a mass movement of iron and steel smelting. Ninety thousand science and engineering students and young teachers from colleges and universities went to the iron and steel front in a planned way to participate in and support mass steelmaking and the "three autumns" movement. Among them, more than 2,000 teachers and students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel went to 22 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country to participate in local mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, machine equipment manufacturing and installation, metallographic analysis, metal pressure processing, stereotype and parts design, and other work. Steelmaking in the furnace and tempering people outside the furnace, they trained a large number of iron and steel workers and technical cadres, and they themselves were also strictly tempered. "Tramping all over the north and south of the Great Wall, vowing to fight for iron and steel; sweating and washing the motherland, steel casting a peaceful country; the light of the furnace illuminates the universe, and heroes are born!" This is the heroic rhetoric written by the teachers and students who were sent to the lower levels.

Schools running factories, farms, and other social undertakings in a big way, and teachers and students participating in productive labor and professional practice have greatly enriched knowledge and inspired wisdom; many scientific and technological problems have been encountered in production practice and need to be solved urgently. Therefore, a mass movement to conduct scientific research and technological innovation has emerged in colleges and universities and secondary schools, and great achievements have been made.

As a result of the broad masses of people carrying out educational revolution in accordance with the Party's educational policy, various concrete forms of combining education and productive labor have been created. The Party Central Committee summarized the experience of the masses in a timely manner and pointed out the direction of efforts. The main ones are: schools run factories and farms in a big way, and schools should not only train new people, but also trial-produce and produce new products; factories and people's communes run schools in a big way, and factories and people's communes should not only produce material products, but also undertake the task of training new people. Schools are divided into three types: full-time schools, part-time (part-work and part-study) schools, and spare-time schools. Schools at all levels must include productive labor as a formal course in the education plan, and all students must participate in productive labor in accordance with the prescribed time. Full-time schools focus on teaching, and students must participate in certain productive labor and try to combine it with their majors as much as possible. Part-time schools implement part-work and part-study (half-day study and half-day labor, or alternate-day study and alternate-day labor, or one-week study and one-week labor). Students in this type of school are both students and workers or farmers. Students participate in productive labor in three basic forms: one is to work in the school's factories and farms, which is convenient for the overall arrangement of teaching work and makes productive labor regular and systematic; the second is to cooperate or sign contracts with factories and people's communes to work in factories and the countryside, which is conducive to teachers and students to contact workers and peasants and expand the field of students' knowledge; the third is to participate in social public welfare labor, which is particularly conducive to cultivating the communist attitude of not calculating rewards; these three should be planned as a whole and cannot be neglected. Various forms of workers' and peasants' spare-time schools study in their spare time, and teaching should be subordinate to production. This not only realizes the combination of education and productive labor, but also realizes the combination of productive labor and education, so that both can develop to the aspects they lack. The connection between the three types of schools will greatly promote the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants.

Practice has proved that the combination of education and productive labor is of great benefit to the development of teachers and students in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and greatly improves the quality of education

More than a year of practice has fully proved that the combination of education and productive labor is of great benefit to the development of teachers and students in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and greatly improves the quality of education.

Social existence determines people's social consciousness. Students participate in labor practice and have close contact with workers and peasants, and first of all, great changes have taken place in their mental outlook. They have been educated by the working class's class view, labor view, mass view, collective view, and even dialectical materialism view. They are engaged in the furnace of productive labor, tempered and edified, and create material and spiritual wealth for society with their hard work. Only then do they personally experience the truth that labor creates society, and realize that labor is the most heroic cause and the view of despising physical labor is wrong. Labor is glorious and love of labor has become a common practice. They express their contempt for the idea of "enjoying leisure and avoiding labor" with a tenacious and selfless labor attitude. Due to the strengthening of contact with workers and peasants, the firm class stand, clear love and hatred, and excellent qualities of workers and peasants have given students the most vivid education. In labor, they deeply realized the greatness of the working people and increased their ideological feelings of sharing the fate and breathing together with the working people. Labor practice has made them personally experience the greatness of collective strength and the importance of labor discipline, and thus they love the collective more, care about the collective cause, and abide by discipline.

"Worn out palms, changed stand; tanned skin, tempered red thoughts." This is how the broad masses of young intellectuals began to move towards the direction of laborization. Students from worker and peasant backgrounds participate in labor exercises, and their stand is more firm and their awareness is more improved, avoiding the danger of ideological degeneration that may occur due to long-term separation from productive labor. In the eyes of workers and peasants, today's students are no longer "bookworms who are not diligent in their four limbs and do not know the five grains," but are regarded as their own intellectuals. They said, "We used to worry about who you would turn to after you read books, but now we are relieved."

In terms of cultural and scientific knowledge and professional education, due to the combination of teaching and productive labor and the combination of classroom teaching and on-site teaching, schools at all levels have better implemented the principle of unity between theory and practice, and greatly improved teaching effectiveness. Students generally reported that after participating in productive labor, their perceptual knowledge was enriched, their reading became more lively, their understanding of theoretical knowledge was deeper, their learning was faster, they remembered more firmly, and their ability to work independently was enhanced. In particular, the technical and professional courses in higher and secondary specialized schools are much better when combined with production practice than when only taught abstract concepts in the classroom. In terms of production practice, curriculum design, graduation design, and thesis, the effectiveness is even more obvious. In the past, production practice did not pay attention to production results, the labor attitude was not serious, and the operation was not accurate. Now, as much as possible, it is combined with production and the situation has completely changed, and the labor attitude and technical level have been greatly improved. In the past, curriculum design and graduation design were mostly hypothetical topics, divorced from reality. Students said: "From books to materials, from materials to drawings, applying formulas, checking data, the design is over, and it is not easy to judge whether it is correct, often a pile of waste paper." Now, as much as possible, select appropriate practical problems, projects to be put into production, and have a clear purpose; the production object, equipment conditions, technical requirements, plant site address, geological conditions, etc. are all specific. Generally, a method of division of labor design, appropriate rotation, mutual checking, collective discussion, overall mastery, and key in-depth study is adopted. Schools generally believe that this is also one of the best forms of linking theory with practice, which can closely combine teaching, production, and scientific research, and it is much better than hypothetical design. For example, the graduation design topics of Tsinghua University in 1958 were mostly directly involved in production. Among the graduation designs, 228 design projects were identified by relevant parties outside the school as excellent designs, which creatively solved problems in actual production, and 141 projects reached a higher level. Among them, students from the Department of Water Conservancy undertook the entire engineering design of large reservoirs such as Miyun Reservoir, Chaohe Hub, Baihe Hub, and Zhangfang, and several small reservoirs, and the quality was very good. The teaching quality of primary and secondary schools has also improved this year.

As Engels said: "The occurrence and development of science has been determined by production from the beginning." In the second half of 1958, due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, and due to the participation of the broad masses of teachers and students in productive labor, production practice put forward many scientific and technological problems that urgently needed to be solved, which greatly promoted the development of scientific research work in colleges and universities. Under the leadership of the Party, schools at all levels clarified the research direction of linking theory with practice and serving socialist construction; mobilized the masses to break superstitions, liberate their minds, dare to think and dare to act, broke the blind superstition of a few experts and the mysterious view of scientific research work, adopted the mass line of combining experts and the masses, and launched a mass movement in a big way. This has reversed the situation in the past where a few experts carried out scientific research work coldly and distantly from reality for personal fame and fortune; it has set off a high tide of carrying out scientific research, invention, and creation in a big way. The scientific research projects completed by colleges and universities in a few months exceeded ten times that of 1957, and the quality also exceeded any previous year. It has not only solved many problems that urgently need to be solved in the national economy, but also achieved new achievements in mastering emerging scientific and technologies such as atomic energy, jet technology, computing technology, and radio electronics. It should be particularly pointed out that many excellent achievements were made by young teachers and senior students through hard work. New people who are both red and expert are emerging in the new society.

The combination of education and productive labor has not only greatly improved the quality of education, but also hundreds of thousands of college students, millions of secondary school students, tens of millions of primary school students, and millions of educators have formed a huge, vigorous, and cultured labor army, contributing a huge force to the development of the national economy. They have completed a large number of survey and design and construction tasks, produced millions of tons of iron and hundreds of thousands of tons of steel, tens of thousands of various types of lathes and tools, hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical products and light industrial products, carried out large-scale afforestation, and developed handicrafts and agricultural and sideline production. They have also universally participated in social public welfare labor, supported the country's various construction undertakings and the agricultural production of people's communes without compensation, and created a large amount of material wealth for the country.

Through the great leap forward in education in 1958, most areas across the country have basically achieved that people's communes have kindergartens and primary schools in every team, junior high schools in every commune, high schools in every county, secondary specialized schools and junior colleges in every special district, and various types of colleges and universities in every province, city, and autonomous region

Since 1958, in conjunction with the educational revolution, we have implemented the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" to develop the people's education cause, mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and implemented the mass line of the whole Party and the whole people running schools. That is, under the principle of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, combining the central overall planning and local decentralization, implement the state running schools and factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes running schools together, ordinary education and vocational (technical) education together, adult education and children's education together, full-time schools and part-time schools and spare-time schools together, school education and self-study (including correspondence schools, broadcasting schools) together, free education and non-free education together. This has fully mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties to run schools. While the state is running education in a big way, a upsurge has emerged in factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes running education in a big way. In order to rapidly improve their political awareness and cultural and scientific knowledge level, workers and peasants, under the leadership of local party committees, used the method of building schools through labor and donating work and materials to solve the problems of school buildings, equipment, and funding, and used the method of "the able as teachers, taking materials locally" to solve the problem of teachers. In this way, in a short period of a few months, hundreds of thousands of workers' and peasants' spare-time schools, tens of thousands of agricultural middle schools (part-time), and ordinary middle and primary schools and kindergartens of all levels and various forms were set up across the country. Most areas across the country have basically achieved that people's communes have kindergartens and primary schools in every team, junior high schools in every commune, high schools in every county, secondary specialized schools and junior colleges in every special district, and various types of colleges and universities in every province, city, and autonomous region, forming a situation of "schools everywhere, and every household reads." China's education has truly become the cause of the people and the cause of serving the working people and mastered by the working people. The participation of the broad masses of workers and peasants in learning is of extremely great significance to the development of China's socialist cause. Workers and peasants learn politics, philosophy, culture, and technology, and improve their socialist awareness and cultural and scientific knowledge level, so they can play a greater role in various construction undertakings.

The implementation of the Party's education policy has been realized in the sharp struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and the two ideas of advanced and backward

The implementation of the Party's education policy has been realized in the sharp struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and the two ideas of advanced and backward. After the relationship between education and politics, "red" and "expert" was basically resolved, the relationship between education and productive labor became the focus of the struggle between proletarian education thought and bourgeois education thought. When the movement of combining education and productive labor began, people who adhered to the bourgeois stand and viewpoint put forward various "arguments" to criticize the Party's education policy. Individual students from exploiting-class families who adhered to the exploiting-class stand openly expressed their resistance to the Party's education policy. They insisted on the reactionary view that "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," and believed that the only task of students was to study and opposed students participating in labor. In essence, they attempted to permanently maintain the difference between mental labor and physical labor and the special status of bourgeois intellectuals, and fundamentally opposed the laborization of intellectuals and opposed students becoming laborers. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of teachers and students criticized this stand and viewpoint, and through this criticism, they further improved their socialist awareness and advanced more resolutely. When teachers and students went to factories and the countryside to participate in labor exercises and schools ran factories and farms in a big way, some bourgeois educators put forward their so-called "quality problems" again, asserting that "students participating in labor will definitely reduce the quality of teaching." Because they believe that only book knowledge is knowledge, and practical experience does not count as knowledge. They do not understand that students' participation in the practice of production struggle and class struggle is an important way of learning. Only by combining the rational knowledge of books with the perceptual knowledge of practice can they obtain truly complete knowledge. Facts have proved that students participating in productive labor will not only reduce the quality of teaching, but will greatly improve it as long as the arrangement is well combined. Others said that "learning by doing" and "part-work and part-study" are their consistent propositions, as if the combination of education and productive labor is nothing new. Those who say this are actually some bourgeois pragmatists, and their educational propositions have long been criticized. Because they not only ignore the role of theory, but also do not understand "life" as the practice of class struggle and production struggle, they actually cancel education, and therefore are also opposed to the Party's education policy. Some people once thought that "labor is learning," and it seemed that reading or not reading was not important. The Party timely pointed out and corrected this one-sidedness. Labor can certainly learn knowledge that cannot be learned in the classroom, but it is not enough to be satisfied with this perceptual knowledge; it must also be combined with book knowledge and rational knowledge. As Lenin pointed out: "Only by enriching one's mind with all the treasures of knowledge created by mankind can one become a communist." The Party's education policy is to require students to not only learn book knowledge well, but also to appropriately participate in the practice of production struggle and class struggle; to both read and labor, and to combine the two well. It is wrong to only read but not labor, and it is equally wrong to only labor but not read. To realize this policy, it is impossible without a vigorous mass movement to break the shackles of habitual forces, break the old and establish the new. Some people criticize the revolutionary movement of the masses, saying that "the school is chaotic and there is too little order." This is nothing but the usual distortion of the revolutionary mass movement by the bourgeoisie. When it comes to order, our difference with the bourgeoisie is not whether order is needed, but what kind of order is needed and how to establish this order. Just as the education of the exploiting class has a school order that is suitable for its educational purpose and policy, the education of the proletariat also needs a school order that is suitable for its own education policy; this order can only be created by the mass movement of breaking the old and establishing the new. The Party and the government have summarized the experience created by the masses and have made comprehensive provisions for the school's teaching, productive labor, and student life. Now a new school order suitable for implementing the Party's education policy has been established.

The Party's leadership is a guarantee of all victories. The reason why the struggle between the two roads and two methods on the education front can achieve victory is due to the Party's correct leadership, and these victories in turn further consolidated the Party's leading position in education work and improved the Party's leadership prestige in schools. This is a victory of decisive significance in the great educational revolution in 1958.

The socialist education cause must be led by the Party, because the socialist education cause is one of the powerful tools of the proletariat to transform mankind and transform nature. It is an important part of the socialist revolution and socialist construction cause. The task of education work is inseparable from the overall political and economic situation and tasks. Without the unified leadership of the Party, it will lose its direction and it will not be possible to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction well. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the education principles of Marxism-Leninism, summarized the rich experience of China's revolutionary education cause, and not only formulated a complete set of education policies, guidelines, and working methods, but also solved a series of problems theoretically and ideologically, so that China's education can smoothly advance along the socialist road.

The Party's leadership over education work is established and consolidated through the gradual victory of proletarian education thought over bourgeois education thought. Since 1958, the Party Central Committee and party committees at all levels have taken a series of measures to strengthen the leadership over education work. Regularly hold meetings to discuss education work, repeatedly publicize the Party's education policy, deeply check the implementation of the policy and summarize experience, timely solve various problems in the process of the great revolution and great leap forward in education, implement the secretary's command and the whole Party running schools, and transferred a large number of leading backbones who have been tempered in long-term revolutionary struggles to schools at all levels to take on leadership work. Colleges and universities implement the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the school party committee, strengthen the leadership in political and ideological work, teaching work, scientific research work, etc., and ensure the implementation of the Party's policies, guidelines, and achieved a great victory in the educational revolution.

Under the strong leadership of the Party, educators should check the right-leaning ideas in education work, redouble their efforts, and continue to leap forward

Now our country, under the illumination of the Party's general line of building socialism, is continuing to leap forward this year after the great leap forward last year. The people's communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and development and are further exerting their great power. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule is turning the creativity of the Chinese people into a torrent, breaking through various obstacles, and advancing towards new victories. All our educators must conscientiously study the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, check and overcome various right-leaning ideas and emotions, oppose right-leaning opportunism, improve political awareness, unify understanding, strengthen unity, redouble revolutionary efforts, and strive to resolutely implement the Party's general line.

Our education cause, after ten years of development, especially the great victory of the great educational revolution and great leap forward in 1958, has gained rich experience. Under the strong leadership of the Party, educators across the country should check and overcome the right-leaning ideas in education work, redouble their efforts, and do their work better. Areas that have completed the task of eliminating illiteracy and popularizing primary and junior high school education should pay attention to consolidating their positions, improving quality, and conscientiously running a number of key schools. Full-time schools must not relax productive labor while improving the quality of teaching, and colleges and universities should actively carry out scientific research work, coordinate with the situation of the continuous leap forward in the national economy, actively carry out the anti-illiteracy campaign and develop and run workers' and peasants' spare-time schools well. We must constantly sum up experience in practice, overcome shortcomings and various obstacles in our work, continue to leap forward, consolidate and develop the education revolution, strive to complete the historical task of the cultural revolution more quickly, popularize education, and cultivate a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, fundamentally change the "poor and blank" face of our country, and make our country "appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."

    我国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，正在以冲天的干劲，迅速改变着我国“一穷二白”的面貌。党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，鼓舞着全国人民以高度的革命热情和无穷的创造力量去夺取一个又一个的胜利。像其他各个战线一样，教育战线也经历了不断革命不断胜利的十年。十年以来，在祖国辽阔的土地上，已经建立起上百万所各级各类学校，使近两亿人民得到受教育的机会。广大工农群众正在用社会主义、共产主义思想和现代科学文化知识武装自己。一支宏大的又红又专的知识分子队伍正在形成。旧中国文化教育落后的面貌正在迅速地改变。
    十年来，我国教育事业发展的速度和规模，是历史上从未有过的。到1958年，各级学校的学生数及其比旧中国最高年份增加的倍数是：受学前教育的幼儿达到三千一百万人，增加二百三十七倍；小学生达到八千六百多万人，增加二点六倍，全国学龄儿童有85％已经入学，许多市县基本上普及了小学教育；中学生达到一千零五十二万人，增加五点六倍；中等专业学校学生达到一百四十七万人，增加二点八倍；高等学校学生达到六十六万人，增加三点二倍。1958年是教育事业大跃进的一年，在这一年当中，受学前教育的幼儿就增加了三千万人；小学生增加了二千二百万人，比1957年增长34.4％；中等学校学生增加了五百万人，增长70％；高等学校学生增加了二十二万人，增长50％。十年来，全国高等学校和中等专业学校，共计为国家培养了近二百万高级和中级专门人才。同时，我们在将近一亿青壮年工人、农民中进行了扫除文盲的工作，大力地发展了工农业余教育。1958年参加扫盲学习的有六千万人，参加各种业余学校学习的有三千余万人。解放以前，工农群众的子女能够上学的很少。建国以来，国家采取种种措施，不断扩大各级学校学生中的工农成份，到1958年，幼儿园的幼儿和小学学生中90％以上是工农子女；中等学校学生中工农成份占70％以上；高等学校学生中工农成份占48％，其中1958年新生中已上升到62％。
    教育事业的巨大发展是十年来教育改革特别是1958年教育大革命和大跃进的结果
    我国教育事业的巨大发展，是十年来教育改革特别是1958年教育大革命和大跃进的结果。中华人民共和国成立后，我们就接收了全国的学校，取消了国民党反动派对学校的法西斯管理制度和特务统治。并且从帝国主义者手里收回了教育主权。接着在全国学校中，进行了马克思列宁主义的思想政治教育，结合着历次政治运动对教师和学生进行思想改造，批判了封建的买办的法西斯主义的思想和资产阶级思想。1957年又进行了整风和反对资产阶级右派的斗争。在进行这些思想斗争的同时，我们继承过去革命根据地教育工作的优良传统和学习苏联教育事业的先进经验，按照社会主义教育原则对旧教育进行了一系列的改革，逐步建立起社会主义的教育制度。高等学校进行了院系调整，大大增加了工科和师范学生的比重，高等学校工科学生占全国学生总数，已由旧中国1947年的17.8％。上升到37％以上，高等师范学生已由13.5％，上升到24％以上。结合着院系调整，实行了分专业培养专门人才的方法，高等学校和中等专业学校各设置了三百余种专业。这就更加适应国家建设的需要。对各级各类学校的设置和发展，按照全国一盘棋的精神，结合地区的特点，进行了合理的部署，大大地加强了内地的高等学校和中等专业学校，着重发展了工矿地区、广大乡村和少数民族地区的中、小学教育，从根本上改变了半封建半殖民地的旧中国教育事业的畸形发展的状况。在团结、改造、教育原有教师的同时，大力培养了新的师资，各级学校的专业教师队伍，已由1949年的九十三万人增加到1958年的二百五十万人，由于他们的政治觉悟和业务水平的不断提高，在教育战线上，涌现出了成千上万的模范教师和先进工作者。
    1958年，我国人民在先后取得了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利的基础上，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的照耀和鼓舞下，实现了国民经济的大跃进并在全国农村实现了人民公社化。在这种新形势下，广大工农群众迫切要求迅速提高文化技术水平。为了满足广大群众的要求，为了彻底地完成社会主义革命和加速社会主义建设，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命的历史任务，党中央发布了“关于教育工作的指示”，进一步地阐明了教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，教育工作必须由党来领导。并且强调指出，为了多快好省地发展教育事业，必须采取“两条腿走路”的办法，走群众路线，实行全党全民办学。党的方针一经提出，立即受到了广大群众的热烈拥护。于是一个以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心内容的教育大革命和多快好省地发展教育事业的群众运动，便在全国蓬勃地发展起来。这个革命彻底破除了资产阶级教育遗留下来的旧制度和旧思想的影响。进一步树立了马克思列宁主义的思想领导，充分发挥了群众办教育的积极性，使我国的教育事业进入了一个崭新的发展时期。
    教育大革命的中心问题是把教育和生产劳动结合起来
    我们的教育事业，是无产阶级用以改造旧社会和建设新社会的强有力的工具之一。远在1934年毛泽东同志就已经指出革命根据地文化教育的总方针在于以共产主义的精神教育广大的劳苦民众，在于使文化教育为革命战争与阶级斗争服务，在于使教育与劳动联系起来，在于使广大中国民众都成为享受文明幸福的人。过去革命根据地和建国以来全国的教育事业，基本上是遵循着这个教育方针进行的。1958年以来教育大革命的目的，就在于使我国的教育事业能够更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为消灭一切剥削阶级和一切剥削制度的残余服务，为将来向共产主义社会过渡，逐步消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别服务。为此，我们的教育工作，必须贯彻执行党的教育方针，“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，培养既有政治觉悟又有文化、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的全面发展的新人，并逐步地实现知识分子劳动化，工农群众知识化。
    教育大革命，进一步解决了教育与政治的关系问题。资产阶级虚伪地标榜“为教育而教育”、“学生不过问政治”。我们则主张教育必须为无产阶级的政治服务，业务必须与政治相结合，培养“又红又专”的人才。为此，我们把马克思列宁主义的思想政治教育和党的政治工作，作为学校一切工作的灵魂，并且在一切文化科学知识的教育中实行政治挂帅。通过系统的马克思列宁主义的理论教育，通过各个时期的政治经济形势和任务的教育，通过参加各种政治运动和生产劳动的实际锻炼，对学校师生广泛地认真地进行了社会主义、共产主义的思想教育。1958年广大师生在党的领导下，运用鸣放辩论、摆事实、讲道理和批评与自我批评的方法，彻底地批判了业务脱离政治的资产阶级的观点，大大地提高了社会主义觉悟。追求个人名利“只专不红”、走“白专道路”的资产阶级个人主义，遭到了广大群众的唾弃。用无产阶级的世界观武装自己，“做工人阶级的知识分子”，成为广大师生坚定的志向。
    教育大革命的中心问题，是把教育和生产劳动结合起来。这是一个有巨大历史意义的深刻的革命。自从人类进入阶级社会以来，一切剥削阶级教育的一个共同特征，是教育与生产劳动分离，是用贱视体力劳动和体力劳动者的精神，用片面的知识去教育受教育者，不彻底革除剥削阶级教育的这个传统，不把教育和生产劳动结合起来，就达不到培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的目的，教育也就不能彻底地为无产阶级的政治服务。
    经过政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命，各级学校师生，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，深深地感觉到进行劳动锻炼的必要。1958年春，在党的号召和领导下，广大学生把劳动和学习结合起来，广泛地开展了参加生产劳动的活动，很快地就发展成为规模宏大的下厂下乡运动，中等以上学校的师生，分批地到工厂、到矿山、到建筑工地、到农村，与工人农民同吃同住同劳动，向工农学习，在劳动中锻炼自己。小学的师生也广泛地参加了力所能及的社会公益劳动。到暑假前夕，在党的“破除迷信、解放思想”的号召下，在工农群众冲天干劲的推动下，广大师生发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，各级学校又掀起了大办工厂、农场的热潮。师生亲自动手，克服困难，和工厂挂钩相互支援。设备不足，就因陋就简；不懂技术，就边干边学；对那些冷眼旁观、讥讽嘲笑的人，就用实际成就回答他们。就这样，往往在几昼夜之间，一个学校内就办起几个几十个大大小小的工厂、车间和作坊。与大办工厂农场的同时，师范院校还到工厂农村大办工农业余学校，医药院校还帮助工农群众大办医院诊所。每个人都以能为工农群众服务、为发展国民经济贡献自己一份力量而感到无上的光荣。在全民大办钢铁的运动中，各地学校师生也掀起了群众性的炼铁炼钢的运动。九万高等学校理、工科的学生和青年教师，有计划地走上钢铁前线，参加和支援群众炼钢和“三秋”运动。其中北京钢铁学院两千多名师生下放到全国二十二个省、市、自治区参加各地采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、机器设备制造安装、金相分析、金属压力加工、定型及部件设计等工作。炉内炼钢，炉外炼人，他们训练了大批的钢铁工人和技术干部，自己也受到了严格的锻炼。“踏遍塞北江南，誓为钢铁而战；汗洗祖国大地，钢铸和平江山；熔炉光照宇宙，炼出英雄好汉！”这就是下放师生写下的豪言壮语。
    学校大办工厂农场和其他社会事业，师生参加生产劳动和业务实践。大大丰富了知识，启发了智慧；在生产实践中遇到了许多科学技术问题，迫切需要解决。于是在高等学校和中等学校里，又出现了大搞科学研究、技术革新的群众运动，并且取得了巨大的成绩。
    广大群众根据党的教育方针进行教育革命的结果，创造了教育与生产劳动相结合的各种具体形式。党中央及时地总结了群众的经验，指出了努力的方向。主要的是：学校大办工厂、农场，学校不仅要培养新人，也要试制和生产新产品；工厂和人民公社大办学校，工厂和人民公社不仅要生产物的产品，也要担负培养新人的任务。学校分为全日制学校、半日制（半工半读）学校和业余学校三种。各级学校都必须把生产劳动作为正式课程列入教育计划，所有学生必须依照规定的时间参加生产劳动。全日制的学校以教学为主，学生必须参加一定的生产劳动，并尽可能地与所学专业相结合。半日制的学校，实行半工半读（半日学习半日劳动，或者隔日学习隔日劳动，或者一周学习一周劳动），这种学校的学生，既是学生也是工人或农民。学生参加生产劳动采取三种基本形式：一是在校内工厂农场劳动，这便于与教学工作统筹安排，使生产劳动经常化、制度化；二是与工厂、人民公社协作或签订合同下厂下乡劳动，这有利于师生联系工农群众和扩大学生知识的领域；三是参加社会公益劳动，这特别有利于培养不计报酬的共产主义的劳动态度；这三者应当统筹安排，不可偏废。各种形式的工农业余学校，在业余时间学习，教学要服从生产。这样既实现了教育结合生产劳动，又实现了生产劳动结合教育，使两者各向自己所缺乏的方面发展。三种学校联系起来，将能够大大促进知识分子劳动化和工农群众知识化。
    实践证明：教育与生产劳动相结合，对师生的德育、智育、体育的发展都有很大的好处，大大提高了教育质量
    一年多来的实践，充分证明了教育与生产劳动相结合，对师生在德育、智育、体育几方面的发展都有很大的好处，大大地提高了教育质量。
    社会存在决定人们的社会意识。学生参加劳动实践，和工农群众发生了密切的联系，首先便在精神面貌方面发生了很大的变化，受到了工人阶级的阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点、集体观点，以至辩证唯物主义观点的教育。他们投身于生产劳动的洪炉，受到锻炼和陶冶，用自己的辛勤劳动，为社会创造了物质的和精神的财富，他们才切身体验到劳动创造社会这个真理，认识到劳动是最豪迈的事业，轻视体力劳动的观点是错误的。劳动光荣、热爱劳动已经形成风气。他们以顽强忘我的劳动态度表示对“好逸恶劳”思想的鄙弃。由于加强了和工农群众的联系，工农群众坚定的阶级立场、鲜明的爱憎和优秀品质，使学生受到了最生动的教育。他们在劳动中深刻地认识了劳动人民的伟大，增长了与劳动人民共命运同呼吸的思想感情。劳动实践使他们亲身体验到集体力量的伟大和劳动纪律的重要，因而更加热爱集体，关心集体事业和遵守纪律。
  “磨破了手掌，改变了立场；晒黑了皮肤，炼红了思想”。广大青年知识分子就是这样开始向着劳动化的方向迈进。工农出身的学生，参加劳动锻炼，则立场更加坚定，觉悟更加提高，避免了因长期脱离生产劳动而可能发生的思想蜕化的危险。现在的学生，在工农群众的心目中再不是“四体不勤、五谷不分”的“读书人”了，而被看作是自己的知识分子。他们说“过去担心的你们读了书不知向着谁，现在放心了。”
    在文化科学知识和专业教育方面，各级学校由于教学和生产劳动相结合，课堂教学和现场教学相结合，就更好地贯彻执行了理论与实践统一的原则，大大地提高了教学效果。学生普遍反映：参加生产劳动以后，感性知识丰富了，书读得活了，对理论知识理解得深了，学习快了，记得牢了，独立工作能力增强了。特别是高等和中等专业学校的技术课和专业课，结合生产实践比只在课堂上讲授抽象的概念要好得多。就生产实习、课程设计、毕业设计和论文方面看，成效更为明显。过去生产实习不重视生产效果，劳动态度不严肃，操作不准确。现在尽可能地结合生产成品，情况完全变了，劳动态度和技术水平大大提高。过去的课程设计和毕业设计，多是假想题目，脱离实际。学生说是：“从书本到资料，从资料到图纸，套公式，查数据，设计结束，是否正确也不好鉴定，往往是一堆废纸”。现在是尽可能地选择适当的实际问题，准备投入生产的项目，有的放矢；生产对象、设备条件、技术要求、厂站地址、地质条件等都是具体的。一般的是采取分工设计、适当轮换、互相校核、集体讨论、全面掌握、重点深入的方式进行。各校普遍地认为，这也是理论联系实际的最好的形式之一，它可以把教学、生产和科学研究紧密地结合起来，它比之假想的设计，要优越得多。如1958年清华大学的毕业设计题目，绝大多数是直接参与生产的。毕业设计中有二百二十八个设计项目，被校外有关方面鉴定为优秀的设计，都是富有创造性地解决了实际生产中的问题，有一百四十一个项目达到了较高的水平。其中水利系同学就承担了密云水库、潮河枢纽、白河枢纽及张坊等大型水库和若干小型水库的全部工程设计，质量很好。中、小学的教学质量，今年也都有所提高。
    正如恩格斯所说：“科学的发生和发展从开始起便是由于生产所决定的。”1958年下半年，由于全国工农业生产的大跃进，由于广大师生的参加生产劳动，生产实践提出了许多急需解决的科学技术问题，这就大大推动了高等学校科学研究工作的开展。各个学校，在党的领导下，明确了理论联系实际、为社会主义建设服务的研究方向；发动群众破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢干，打破了对少数专家的盲目迷信和对科学研究工作的神秘观点，采取了专家与群众相结合的群众路线，大搞群众运动。这就扭转了过去少数专家为了个人名利，脱离实际地、冷冷清清地进行科学研究工作的局面；掀起了大搞科学研究发明创造的高潮。高等学校几个月所完成的科学研究项目超过1957年的十倍，质量也超过以往任何一年。不仅解决了很多国民经济中急需解决的问题，在掌握原子能、喷气技术、计算技术、无线电电子学等新兴的科学技术方面，都有了新的成就。特别应当指出的是，许多优异的成绩是青年教师和高年级学生刻苦钻研做出来的。新社会正涌现出又红又专的新人。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，不仅大大提高了教育质量，几十万大学生、几百万中学生、几千万小学生和几百万教育工作者有组织有领导地参加生产劳动，他们就形成一支庞大的生气勃勃的有文化的劳动大军，在发展国民经济方面贡献了巨大的力量。他们完成了大量的勘查设计和施工的任务，生产了上百万吨铁和几十万吨钢，上万台的各式各样的车床和工具，几十万吨化工产品和轻工业产品，进行了大面积的植树造林，发展了手工业和农副业生产。还普遍地参加了社会公益劳动，无报酬地支援了国家各项建设事业和人民公社的农业生产，为国家创造了大量的物质财富。
    通过1958年教育事业大跃进，全国绝大多数地区，基本上做到了人民公社队队有幼儿园、小学，社社有初中，县县有高中，专区有中等专业学校和专科学校，省、市和自治区有各类高等学校
    1958年以来我们结合着教育大革命，贯彻执行了党的“两条腿走路”的发展人民教育事业的方针，发动群众、依靠群众，实行全党全民办学的群众路线。这就是在统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、中央全面规划与地方分权相结合的原则下，实行国家办学与厂矿、企业、人民公社办学并举，普通教育与职业（技术）教育并举，成人教育与儿童教育并举，全日制学校与半日制、业余学校并举，学校教育与自学（包括函授学校、广播学校）并举，免费的教育与不免费的教育并举。这就充分调动了各个方面办学的积极性，在国家大办教育的同时，出现了厂矿企业、人民公社大办教育的热潮。工人农民为着迅速提高自己的政治觉悟和文化科学知识水平，就在各地党委领导下，运用劳动建校、献工献料的办法来解决校舍设备和经费问题，用“能者为师、就地取材”的办法来解决师资问题，这样就在短短几个月的时间内，全国各地办起了几十万所各级和各种形式的工农业余学校、几万所农业中学（半日制）和普通中、小学及幼儿园。全国绝大多数地区，基本上做到了人民公社队队有幼儿园和小学，社社有初中，县县有高中，专区有中等专业学校和专科学校，省、市、自治区有各类高等学校，形成了“处处有学校、户户读书声”的局面。我国的教育事业已经真正成为人民群众的事业，为劳动人民服务和为劳动人民所掌握的事业。广大工农群众参加学习，对我国社会主义事业的发展有着极其重大的意义。工人、农民学政治、学哲学、学文化、学技术，提高了社会主义觉悟和文化科学知识水平，就能够在各项建设事业中，发挥更大的力量。
    党的教育方针的贯彻执行，是在社会主义与资本主义两条道路、先进思想与落后思想的尖锐斗争过程中实现的
    党的教育方针的贯彻执行，是在社会主义与资本主义两条道路、先进与落后两种思想的尖锐斗争过程中实现的。在教育与政治、“红”与“专”的关系问题得到基本解决以后，教育与生产劳动的关系问题，就成为无产阶级教育思想与资产阶级教育思想斗争的焦点。教育与生产劳动相结合的运动开始的时候，坚持资产阶级立场观点的人，就提出各种各样的“论据”非难党的教育方针，个别出身于剥削阶级家庭，坚持剥削阶级立场的学生，公开表示了他们对党的教育方针的抵抗。他们坚持“万般皆下品、唯有读书高”的反动观点，认定学生唯一的任务就是读书，反对学生参加劳动。实质上他们是企图永远保持脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别和资产阶级知识分子的特殊地位，而根本反对知识分子劳动化，反对学生成为劳动者。广大师生在党的领导下批判了这种立场观点，并通过这种批判进一步提高了自己的社会主义觉悟，更坚决地前进了。师生下厂下乡参加劳动锻炼和学校大办工厂、农场的时候，某些资产阶级教育家又提出了他们所谓的“质量问题”，断定“学生参加劳动，定会降低教学质量”。因为他们认为只有书本知识才是知识，实践经验不算知识。他们不了解，学生参加生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践，是一种重要的学习方式，只有书本的理性知识而不和实践的感性知识结合起来，就不能获得真正完全的知识。事实证明，学生参加生产劳动，教学质量不但不会降低，只要结合安排得好，反而会大大提高。另有一些人，说“从做中学”、“半工半读”是他们的一贯主张，似乎教育与生产劳动结合并不是什么新东西。说这种话的，实际是一些资产阶级实用主义者，他们的教育主张，早就被批判过了。因为他们既忽视理论的作用，又不是把“生活”理解为阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，实际上是取消教育，因而也是与党的教育方针对立的。也有些人曾经认为“劳动就是学习”，读不读书似乎是无关重要的了。党及时地指出和纠正了这种片面性。劳动固然可以学到课堂上学不到的知识，但只满足于这些感性知识是不够的；还必须与书本知识、理性知识结合起来。正如列宁指出的：“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己头脑时，才能成为共产主义者”。党的教育方针，是既要学生学好书本知识，又要他们适当地参加生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践；既要读书，又要劳动，并把两者很好地结合起来。只读书不劳动是不对的，只劳动不读书同样是不对的。要实现这个方针，不经过轰轰烈烈的群众运动，冲破习惯势力的束缚，破旧立新，是不可能的。有些人却在群众的革命运动面前进行非难，说什么“学校搞得乱哄哄，太没有秩序了。”这不过是资产阶级对于革命的群众运动惯常的歪曲。说到秩序，我们与资产阶级的分歧，并不在要不要秩序，而在要怎样的秩序和怎样建立这种秩序。正像剥削阶级的教育有与它的教育目的方针相适合的学校秩序一样，无产阶级的教育也需要有与自己的教育方针相适合的学校秩序；这种秩序只有破旧立新的群众运动才能创立起来。党和政府总结了群众创造的经验，对学校的教学、生产劳动和学生生活已经作出了全面的规定。现在新的适合于贯彻执行党的教育方针的新的学校秩序已经建立起来了。
    党的领导是一切胜利的保证。教育战线上两条道路、两种方法的斗争之所以能取得胜利，是由于有了党的正确领导，而这些胜利反过来又进一步地巩固了党在教育工作中的领导地位，提高了党在学校中的领导威信。这是1958年教育大革命中具有决定意义的胜利。
    社会主义教育事业必须由党来领导，因为社会主义教育事业，是无产阶级改造人类、改造大自然强有力的工具之一。是社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的一个重要组成部分，教育工作的任务，是和整个政治经济的形势和任务分不开的，没有党的统一领导，就会迷失方向，就不可能很好的为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。党中央和毛泽东同志创造性的运用马克思列宁主义的教育原理，总结了我国革命教育事业的丰富经验，不仅制定出一套完整的教育方针路线和工作方法，而且从理论上思想上解决了一系列的问题，从而使我国的教育事业能够顺利地沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    党对教育工作的领导，是通过无产阶级教育思想逐步战胜资产阶级教育思想而确立和巩固起来的。1958年以来，党中央和各级党委为着加强对教育工作的领导而采取了一系列的措施。定期召开会议讨论教育工作，反复宣传党的教育方针，深入检查对方针贯彻执行的情况和总结经验，及时解决教育大革命大进跃过程中的各种问题，实行书记挂帅和全党办学，抽调了大批经过长期革命斗争锻炼的领导骨干到各级学校去担任领导工作，高等学校则实行学校党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，加强了对政治思想工作、教学工作、科学研究工作等方面的领导，保证了党的方针政策的贯彻执行，取得了教育大革命的伟大胜利。
    教育工作者在党的坚强领导下，应该检查教育工作中的右倾思想，鼓足更大干劲，继续跃进
    现在我们的国家在党的建设社会主义总路线的照耀下，继去年的大跃进之后，今年正在继续跃进，人民公社已经走上了巩固的发展道路，进一步发挥它的巨大威力。党的八届八中全会提出的提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的伟大号召，正在把我国人民的创造力汇成巨流，冲破各种障碍，向新的胜利前进。我们全体教育工作者必须认真学习中共中央八届八中全会的决议和有关文件，检查和克服各种右倾思想和情绪，反对右倾机会主义，提高政治觉悟，统一认识，加强团结，鼓足革命干劲，为坚决贯彻执行党的总路线而奋斗。
    我们的教育事业，经过了十年来的发展，特别是1958年教育大革命、大跃进的伟大胜利，已经取得了丰富的经验。全国教育工作者，在党的坚强领导下，应该检查和克服教育工作中的右倾思想，把干劲鼓得更足，工作做得更好，已经完成扫盲任务和普及了小学和初中教育的地区，要注意巩固阵地，提高质量，并认真办好一批重点学校。全日制学校，在提高教学质量的同时，决不能放松生产劳动，高等学校并应积极地开展科学研究工作，配合着国民经济继续跃进的形势，积极开展扫盲运动和发展、办好工农业余学校。我们要在实践中不断的总结经验，克服工作中的缺点和这样那样的阻碍，继续跃进，巩固与发展教育革命，争取更快地完成文化革命，普及教育，培养一支数以千万计的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍的历史任务，从根本上改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，使我们国家“以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”
