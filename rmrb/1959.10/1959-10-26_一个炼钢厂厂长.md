    A Steel Factory Director
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper　Yin Can
    I've known him for a long time. More than a decade ago, he changed his name to "Langtao" (Wave Washing); it was not until 1945, when he came to Northeast China, that he restored his original name, "Zeng Yangqing."
    Zeng Yangqing is the director of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and he is thirty-nine years old this year. When he was young, needless to say, he had never studied steelmaking, nor had he even thought about it. Influenced by progressive literature and art, he once hoped to become a writer in the future. In February 1938, he asked to join the anti-Japanese forces, quietly left Hangzhou High School, and went to Yan'an with companions. – This was the common destiny of Chinese youth in the 1940s: all roads lead to Yan'an, to go to Yan'an and embark on the road of revolution. For quite a long time, during the few years when he studied and worked at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an, he was enthusiastic about literary creation. He liked to write prose, and several of his articles were published in the "Liberation Daily" at that time. I read one of them:
  “Melancholy Memories,” which was very moving. The writing attitude was serious.
    Zeng Yangqing took every job assigned to him by the Party seriously. In the early days of the liberation of Northeast China, he worked in newspapers and in mass movement work. Under the education of the Party, the consciousness of a Party member fundamentally freed himself from the fetters of personal desires, followed the guidance of the Party in everything, and obeyed the needs of practical work, striving to be a useful person to the Party and the people. Zeng Yangqing was working in this direction.
    In March 1949, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that the focus of the Party's work should shift from rural areas to cities. The plenary session called on all Party comrades to devote all their efforts to learning the technology and management methods of industrial production. At that time, how many Party members asked the Party organization to allow them to engage in industry! Zeng Yangqing also put forward the same desire, and as a result, he was fortunate enough to obtain the approval of the organization.
    From 1949 to 1959, it was a full ten years. In these ten years, our motherland has undergone tremendous and encouraging changes. For Zeng Yangqing personally, the changes in the ten years have also been great: he learned to make steel and learned to be the director of a steel factory.
    In the beginning, for more than a year, it was really difficult. Zeng Yangqing was assigned to the Central China Iron and Steel Company as deputy manager in charge of military takeover work. Later, the Party Central Committee decided to first build the Northeast Industrial Base, and technical personnel were transferred from Guannei (inside the Pass) to support the Northeast. He led more than a dozen engineers back to the Northeast. He was assigned to Benxi Iron and Steel Company, in charge of the production department. The production department was in charge of production scheduling, technical safety, equipment maintenance, and technical operations, but he didn't understand any of them. He should have managed it, but he didn't understand it, which was the most distressing thing. At this time, he truly tasted the feeling of "what I used to know is useless today, and what I didn't know in the past, I have to pick up today." The old staff gave him a nickname: "White Hat." A Communist Party member couldn't stand such ridicule, so he worked hard to study and delve into it, and he also figured out a little bit, but he still couldn't take off that "white hat" and it was difficult to effectively grasp the whole work.
    Just as he was worried about not understanding industrial technology, the most ideal learning opportunity came. In the autumn of 1951, the organization sent a group of cadres and workers to study in the Soviet Union. Zeng Yangqing was also sent there. Before he went to the Soviet Union, he had never even seen a steelmaking open-hearth furnace. We did not have it, but the Soviet Union had it all; we did not know it, but the Soviet Union had a complete set of knowledge and experience. Soviet comrades cultivated our comrades who went to study with unlimited enthusiasm, fearing only that the Chinese comrades would learn too little and too slowly. In this moving friendship and enthusiastic teaching, Zeng Yangqing firmly laid the rational knowledge foundation of the subject of steelmaking.
    Not long after returning to China, at the beginning of 1954, Zeng Yangqing took the position of director of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Steelmaking is a very arduous and heavy labor. Some people compare steelmaking to fighting, which is not an exaggeration at all. The temperature in the open-hearth furnace is over a thousand degrees, and it is conceivable how hard and tiring it is to operate at such a high temperature. As the ancient saying goes: those who till are happy in the fields, and those who fight are at ease in difficulties. He examined and enriched the technology of steelmaking through complex production struggles, and this was the real beginning.
    At that time, the chief engineer of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was in charge of production, and it was difficult to grasp the entire plant's production. Zeng Yangqing decided to grasp production himself, and he focused his work on earnestly implementing the various suggestions of Soviet experts.
    The major problem encountered head-on was that the furnace repair rate was too high, reaching 13%; that is to say, the furnace was being repaired for thirteen days out of a hundred days, and steel could not be made. Furnace repair is an indispensable process in steelmaking production. Generally, according to the situation of producing three furnaces of steel per day on average, the furnace must be repaired every seven to ten days to repair the refractory material at the bottom of the furnace to avoid accidents such as steel leakage. The technician in charge of furnace maintenance insisted that the 13% furnace repair rate could not be changed. However, the furnace repair rate of the three open-hearth furnaces in charge of Chen Xiaofa, a furnace maintenance technician from a worker's background, was much lower. Zeng Yangqing discovered this situation and, after research and experimentation, resolutely adopted the new furnace repair method of the Soviet Kuts-Zyk Steel Plant and Chen Xiaofa's advanced experience. It was really effective immediately. Within two months, the furnace repair rate of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant continuously dropped from 13% to 8% and 4%, and reached 2.2% at best. The solution to this problem refreshed the production record of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, and the first quarter of 1954 exceeded the state plan by 30,000 tons of steel.
    The victory in the first round was achieved under the leadership of the Party, delving into the production process, working hard to study the business, and relying on the masses. Especially in mastering business and technology, he received enthusiastic and specific help from Soviet experts.
    How can a steel factory director fully grasp the production of the entire factory? The Soviet Union has a set of successful experiences. In March 1954, the Soviet steelmaking expert Comrade Lanko came to the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant. Under the premise of the director's direct responsibility, Soviet experts provided many valuable suggestions. Zeng Yangqing recalled expert Lanko and said: "For those two years, he was my teacher and also my close friend; we shared difficulties and shared joy." This is not an exaggeration at all.
    Over the years, due to his hard work, he has possessed a certain ability to manage the factory. The production of a steel factory is very complicated, and the technical requirements for production in each workshop are very high. In particular, close cooperation is required between each process, which requires the factory director to be good at scheduling production and connecting each link and process. The normal operation of the entire factory's production, especially making the production landscape change with each passing day, will depend on the full mobilization of the masses and the continuous improvement of management level by the factory's leadership.
    He told me: "Going to do it on the spot is the best learning." In the summer of 1954, the seamless steel pipe factory needed a large amount of No. 10 seamless steel pipe steel. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was responsible for supplying this steel, but the production quantity was small and the supply could not meet the demand. This steel is low-sulfur, low-carbon killed steel, and the seamless steel pipes made of it can withstand high pressure and can withstand dozens or even hundreds of atmospheres. This steel is very difficult to make, and only one engineer in the entire factory can make it. This engineer is willing to teach others, but he can't explain it clearly. Zeng Yangqing decided to do it himself. He led the furnace foreman to make steel every day, practicing while checking data, and after making more than thirty furnaces, he finally succeeded. The workers saw him staying on the open-hearth furnace operating platform all day long and jokingly called him "Open-hearth Furnace Director."
    Zeng Yangqing's enthusiasm for smelting operations has two reasons. One is that the types of steel needed by the country are increasing with the development of construction, and as a factory director, he has the responsibility to complete the glorious task entrusted to him by the country. According to Soviet experience, the first furnace of new steel grades is always smelted by the deputy director in charge of production himself, and he feels that this is very necessary. Another reason is that he has a strong interest in smelting operations. He once talked to me about a Soviet steelmaking expert who traveled to several steelmaking plants in our country. No matter which steelmaking plant he went to, he always liked to smelt a few furnaces himself, otherwise he couldn't get over his addiction. He said, "I am not a steelmaking expert yet, but I very much understand the psychology of that expert."
    Through a relatively long period of practice, Zeng Yangqing learned to think independently and formed his own new insights on some issues. In June 1956, his thinking on the problem of slag making was an example.
    The problem of slag making (effectively smelting impurities in molten steel into steel slag) is a problem that steelmaking workers often study. Under normal circumstances, slag making is done during the refining period. After a long period of careful observation and practical operation, Zeng Yangqing proposed to advance slag making in the initial melting stage, which can reduce the melting time by sixteen minutes per furnace of steel compared to slag making in the refining period. How great is the value of these ten minutes accumulated over time!
    At that time, Soviet experts attached great importance to this technological innovation. The factory leadership decided to experiment: under different conditions such as the best, medium, and worst thermal efficiency, after 600 furnaces of experiments, it was finally confirmed that this reform was successful and it was decided to include it in the new operating procedures.
    An intellectual who is not from a proletarian background, even after a relatively long period of revolutionary training, is prone to pride and complacency and detachment from the masses if he is not vigilant at all times. Zeng Yangqing has also suffered from this.
    After he took office as the director of the steelmaking plant, due to overestimating his personal ability and role and relying too much on administrative orders, the distance between him and the factory's employees and the masses became greater and greater. He went to the site every day, sometimes personally guiding operations, but he used a bureaucratic attitude to guide production. If things didn't go smoothly, he would lose his temper. The workers would walk around him when they saw him, and the foreman would go to other furnaces (the foreman is in charge of three furnaces), fearing him. Zeng Yangqing recalled this period and severely blamed himself, saying: "No wonder an old worker said: 'Our factory director is like a coachman, and we are the car pullers.' This sentence vividly and profoundly depicts how I managed production with such a bad style."
    In January 1956, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward serious criticism of his conservative thinking and detachment from the masses. The employees of the steelmaking plant also put forward earnest criticisms. He realized his mistakes and made a profound ideological self-criticism at the enlarged meeting of the steelmaking plant's Party committee.
    After the criticism from the municipal Party committee and the employee masses, his work style quickly underwent significant changes.
    1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward, and the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was also advancing by leaps and bounds. In the factory, right-leaning conservative ideas were opposed, full enthusiasm was encouraged, and the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and worker masses was used to jointly complete the leap forward targets. Zeng Yangqing realized the true meaning of "consulting with the masses when something happens" in the "three-way combination."
    Last year, the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant took the biggest step in the fourth quarter. Compared with the same period last year, production increased by 11.87% in this quarter. From this ratio, it is not difficult for anyone to imagine how great the enthusiasm of the entire factory's employees was and how many effective measures there were. Here, only one production increase measure is mentioned - adding molten iron.
    On September 25th last year, after listening to Comrade Li Fuchun's call for increasing steel production at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's employee meeting, Zeng Yangqing discussed with the Party Committee Secretary: if another pot of molten iron could be added after the steel water boils and before the steel is tapped, it would definitely increase production a lot. He said that even if this pot is only fifty tons, producing twenty furnaces a day can increase production by one thousand tons a day, and increase production by more than 300,000 tons a year; if the entire company does this, it can increase production by more than one million tons a year.
    Zeng Yangqing's idea is not a fantasy, it is based on something. In April last year, he "planted experimental fields" in the No. 7 open-hearth furnace, trying to load 300 tons of material into the No. 7 furnace, which was designed to have a capacity of 225 tons, and the effect was very good, making the average utilization coefficient (the steel production per cubic meter of open-hearth furnace hearth area per day and night) of the No. 7 furnace reach 11.97 for the entire month. In May, the experience of loading more in the No. 7 furnace was promoted throughout the factory. Later, Hao Jinfang, the chief furnace foreman of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, proposed that molten iron can be added when the furnace is "softly melted" (referring to the situation where the carbon in the molten steel in the furnace is low when melting is completed. "Low carbon when melting is completed" refers to the fact that the carbon in the molten steel at the end of smelting is too low, not meeting the steel tapping requirements. Adding molten iron again is precisely to increase carbon and make the carbon content at the end of melting meet the planned steel grade requirements.). After experiments, it was found that deliberately "soft melting" can add more molten iron, but the smelting time is extended by two or three hours, which is not cost-effective after comparison. However, Zeng Yangqing has never given up the idea of adding more molten iron.
    On this day, Zeng Yangqing thought of a new method: after refining, first tap a pot of rimmed steel, and immediately add a pot of molten iron, and high-carbon steel can also be produced. There is a scientific basis for doing so. Molten iron contains 4% carbon (that is, one hundred tons of molten iron contains four tons of carbon), and the amount of carbon in steel varies depending on the steel grade. For example, rimmed steel contains only 0.10% carbon, and high-carbon steel contains 0.77% carbon. To maintain how much carbon, it can be adjusted by adding molten iron.
    The next day, under his leadership and the cooperation of the workers, the experiment began. The first furnace failed. The second furnace was successfully smelted, costing only fifteen more minutes and gaining an extra pot (fifty tons) of steel that met national standards.
    How to be a good steel factory director, I cannot give a definite answer. Generally speaking, it is nothing more than possessing two aspects of conditions: political conditions and technical conditions. The former condition requires political command, earnestly implementing the director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee, adhering to the mass line work method for employees, and consulting with the masses when something happens; the latter condition requires familiarity with the production process, understanding of operations, and having independent opinions and a certain level of enterprise management. In our country's young steel enterprises, under the long-term cultivation of the Party and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the technical forces leading industry are growing rapidly, and the former laymen have become experts today. Zeng Yangqing is one of them.
    From the changes that have taken place in Zeng Yangqing's ten years, and thinking about the Party and administrative leaders of state-owned industrial enterprises, they were not engaged in industry in the past, but why can they effectively lead industrial enterprises today? This is something that can be understood.

    一个炼钢厂厂长
    本报特约记者　殷参
    我很早就认识他。十几年前，他改名叫“浪淘”；1945年来东北，才恢复原来的姓名“曾扬清”。
    曾扬清是鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂厂长，今年三十九岁。他年青的时候，不用说没有学过炼钢，连想也没有想过。由于进步文艺的影响，他曾经希望将来当一个作家。1938年2月，他要求参加抗日队伍，悄悄地离开杭州高中，结伴投奔延安。——这是二十世纪四十年代的中国青年的共同命运：条条大路通延安，到延安去，迈上革命的道路。有相当长的一段时间，当他在延安鲁艺学习和工作的几年里，他曾热衷于文学创作。他喜欢写散文，有几篇发表在当时“解放日报”上。我读过其中的一篇：
  “忧郁的怀念”，很动人。写作态度是严肃的。
    曾扬清对党分配给他的每一件工作，都是认真严肃的。解放东北初期，他做过报纸工作，也做过民运工作。在党的教育下，党员的自觉使自己基本上摆脱了个人欲望的羁绊，一切遵循着党的指引和服从实际工作的需要，努力做一个对党对人民有用的人。曾扬清正是朝着这个方向努力的。
    1949年3月，党的七届二中全会指出：党的工作重心从乡村移到城市。全会号召全党同志，用全力学习工业生产的技术和管理方法。当时，多少党员纷纷请求党组织允许自己去搞工业呵！曾扬清也提出同样的愿望，结果幸运地获得组织上的批准。
    从1949年到1959年，是整整的十年。这十年里，我们的祖国有着令人鼓舞的巨大的变化。对曾扬清个人说来，十年的变化也是很大的，学会炼钢，学会当一个炼钢厂的厂长。
    开始的一年多，真是困难得不行。曾扬清被分配到华中钢铁公司，担任副经理，主持军事接管工作。以后，党中央决定先建设东北工业基地，从关内抽调技术人员支援东北，他带领了十多个工程师回到了东北。他被分配到本溪钢铁公司，负责生产处工作。生产处要管生产调度，要管技术安全，要管设备检修，要管技术操作，他却样样不明白；应该管起来，却又不懂，是最苦恼了。这时，真正尝到“过去会的，今天用不上，过去不会的，今天却要拿起来”的滋味了。旧人员给他送了一个雅号：“白帽子”。共产党员可受不住这种讥笑，他发愤地勤学习苦钻研，也摸到一点门道，却总是不能摘下那顶“白帽子”，很难做到有效地把整个工作抓起来。
    正愁不懂工业技术，最理想的学习机会来到了。1951年秋天，组织上派一批干部和工人去苏联学习。曾扬清也被派前往。他选择了学习炼钢。他到苏联之前，连炼钢的平炉都没有见过，既无感性知识，又无理性知识。我们没有的，苏联全有了；我们不会的，苏联有一整套的知识和经验。苏联同志以无限的热诚，最快最好地培养我国前去学习的同志，惟恐中国同志学得少了学得慢了。在这个感人的友谊和热忱的教导中，曾扬清牢实地打下了炼钢这门学问的理性知识的基础。
    回国后不久，1954年年初，曾扬清担任鞍钢第一炼钢厂厂长的职务。炼钢是一项十分艰苦而繁重的劳动。有人把炼钢比做战斗，一点也不夸张。平炉里的温度有一千几百度，在这样的高温下操作，其辛苦劳累是可想而知了。古语说：其耕者乐田，其战士安难。他通过复杂的生产斗争，检验和丰富炼钢这门学问的技术，这才是真正的开始。
    当时，一炼钢厂由主任工程师管生产，把全厂生产抓起来有不少困难。曾扬清决定自己抓生产，他把工作的重点放在认真贯彻苏联专家的各项建议上。
    迎面碰到的重大问题是炼炉率太高，竟达13％；就是说，一百天里有十三天时间在炼炉，不能炼钢。炼炉是炼钢生产中不可缺少的一道工序，一般的按照每天平均出三炉钢的情况，每隔七天至十天就得炼一次炉，把炉底的耐火材料修补一遍，免得发生漏钢等事故。那位负责护炉的技师坚持13％的炼炉率无法改变。而工人出身的护炉技师陈效法负责的三个平炉炼炉率却要低得多。曾扬清发现这个情况，经过研究和试验，果断地采用苏联库茨?兹克钢铁厂的新炼炉法和陈效法的先进经验。真是立竿见影，在两个月内，一炼钢厂的炼炉率由13％连续下降到8％、4％，最好时达到2.2％。这个问题的解决，刷新了一炼钢厂的生产记录，1954年第一季度比国家计划超产三万吨钢。
    头一个回合的胜利，是在党的领导下，深入生产过程，刻苦钻研业务和依靠群众取得的。尤其在掌握业务和技术方面，得到苏联专家热情的具体帮助。
    一个炼钢厂厂长怎样才能把全厂的生产全面地抓起来？苏联有一套成功的经验。1954年3月，苏联炼钢专家兰柯同志来到一炼钢厂。苏联专家在厂长直接负责的前提下，提供了许许多多宝贵的建议。曾扬清回忆兰柯专家时说：“那二年多，他是我的教师，又是我亲密的朋友；我们同担困难，同享欢乐。”这话丝毫也不过分。
    几年来，由于他辛勤地工作，已经具备了一定的管理工厂的能力。一个炼钢厂的生产很复杂，每个车间的生产技术要求很高，尤其是各道工序之间需要紧密配合，这就要求厂长善于调度生产，善于把每个环节、每道工序衔接起来。全厂生产的正常进行，特别是使得生产面貌日新月异，将取决于厂的领导上充分的发动群众和管理水平的不断提高。
    他告诉我：“实地去干，是最好的学习。”1954年夏天，无缝钢管厂需要大量十号无缝钢管的钢种。一炼钢厂负责供应这种钢种，只是生产数量少，供不应求。这种钢是低硫低碳镇静钢，用它制成的无缝钢管能耐高压，经得起几十个甚至几百个大气压。这种钢很不好炼，全厂只有一位工程师能炼。这位工程师倒愿意教别人，就是说不明白。曾扬清决定自己干。他天天领着炉长炼钢，一边实践，一边查资料，炼了三十几炉，终于炼成了。工人们见他成天呆在平炉操作台上，戏谑地叫他“平炉厂长”。
    曾扬清的热衷于冶炼操作，有两种原因。一种是国家需要的钢种，随着建设的发展而增多，他作为一个厂长，有责任完成国家赋予的光荣任务。按照苏联的经验，新钢种的头一炉，总是管生产的副厂长亲自炼的，他觉得这样作很有必要。再一种原因，是他对冶炼操作有浓厚的兴趣。他曾和我谈到一位苏联的炼钢专家，跑遍我国几个炼钢厂，不论他到哪个炼钢厂去，总爱自己炼上几炉，不然就过不了瘾似的。他说，“我还不是炼钢专家，但我非常理解那位专家的心理。”
    通过较长时期的实践，曾扬清学会独立思考，在某些问题上形成自己的新的见解。1956年6月，他关于造渣问题的思考就是一个例子。
    造渣问题（把钢水里的杂质有效地熔炼成钢渣）是炼钢工人经常研究的问题。在通常的情况下，都是精炼期造渣。经过长期的细心观察和实际操作，曾扬清提出熔化初期提前造渣，每一炉钢比精炼期造渣可以减少十六分钟熔炼时间。这十几分钟的日积月累该有多大的价值呵！
    当时，苏联专家对这一技术革新非常重视。厂的领导决定试验：在热效力最好、中等、最坏等不同的情况下，经过六百炉的试验，最后肯定这一改革是成功的，决定列入新的操作规程。
    一个非无产阶级出身的知识分子，虽然经过较长时期的革命锻炼，如果不是时刻警惕，那末，当他取得某些成绩的时候，很容易骄傲自满，脱离群众，曾扬清也吃过这种苦头。
    他担任炼钢厂厂长以后，由于过高地估计个人的能力和作用，过多地依靠行政命令，结果，和厂里的职工群众越离越远了。他天天下现场，有时亲自指导操作，却是用官僚主义的态度来指导生产，稍有不顺意，就发脾气。工人见他就绕着走，工长见他就上别的炉子（工长管三个炉子），对他望而生畏。曾扬清回忆起这一段，痛切地责备自己说：“无怪乎有个老工人说：‘我们厂长就像赶车的，我们是拉车的。’这句话很形象很深刻地描绘出我是用一种多么恶劣的作风来管理着生产。”
    1956年1月，中共鞍山市委对他的思想保守和脱离群众提出严肃的批评。炼钢厂的职工也提出恳切的批评。他认识到自己的错误，在炼钢厂党委扩大会议上作了深刻的思想检讨。
    经过市委和职工群众的批评之后，他的工作作风很快有了显著的转变。
    1958年是大跃进的一年，第一炼钢厂也突飞猛进着。在工厂里，反对了右倾保守思想，鼓足了干劲，用领导干部、技术人员和工人群众三者相结合的方法，共同出力完成跃进指标。曾扬清在“三结合”里体会到“有事和群众商量”的真实含义。
    去年第一炼钢厂迈的步子最大的是第四季度。这一季度与前年同期相比，生产增长11.87％。从这个比数，谁都不难想见，全厂职工的干劲该有多大，该有多少行之有效的措施。这里，仅仅举出一项增产措施——兑铁水。
    去年9月25日，听了李富春同志在鞍钢职工大会上提出增产钢铁的号召，曾扬清就和党委书记核计：如果能在钢水沸腾以后、出钢以前，多兑进一罐铁水，定能增产很多。他说，即使这一罐只有五十吨，每天出二十炉，一天就能增产一千吨，一年就能增产三十几万吨；如果全公司都这样干，每年就能增产一百多万吨。
    曾扬清的这个念头并非空想，是有根据的。去年4月，他在七号平炉“种试验田”，试着在这设计能力二百二十五吨的七号炉里装了三百吨料，效果很好，使七号炉全月的平均利用系数（平炉炉底面积每立方米每昼夜的钢产量）达到十一点九七。5月份，在全厂推广了七号炉多装的经验。后来，一号平炉总炉长郝金芳提出，炉子“软溶”（指炉里钢水的熔毕碳低的状况，“熔毕碳低”则是指熔炼完毕的钢水里碳素太低，不合出钢要求，再兑铁水，正是为了增加碳素，使熔毕碳达到计划钢种要求。）的时候可以兑铁水，多兑铁水就能多产钢。经过试验，故意“软溶”可以多兑铁水，但是熔炼时间延长二三小时，比较一下，不合算。曾扬清却一直没有放弃多兑铁水的念头。
    这一天，曾扬清想到一个新的办法：精炼以后，先出一罐沸腾钢，立即兑进一罐铁水，还能出高碳钢。这样做是有科学根据的。铁水中含碳4％（即一百吨铁水里有四吨碳），钢中含碳多少则因钢种不同而异，如沸腾钢含碳仅0.10％，高碳钢含碳有0.77％的，想保持多少碳素，可以用兑进铁水的方法加以调节。
    第二天，在他的主持和工人的配合下，开始试验。第一炉失败了。第二炉试炼成功，仅仅多花费十五分钟，多得了一罐（五十吨）质量符合国家标准的钢。
    怎样才算当好一个炼钢厂厂长，我无法作出确切的答案。一般的说，不外乎具备两方面的条件：政治条件和技术条件。前一个条件，要求作到政治挂帅，在党委的领导下，认真执行厂长负责制，对职工坚持群众路线的工作方法，有事和群众商量；后一个条件，要求熟悉生产过程，懂得操作，而且有独立的见解和一定的企业管理水平。在我国年青的钢铁企业里，经过党的长期培养和苏联专家的热忱帮助，领导工业的技术力量正在迅速成长，从前的外行今天已经变成内行。曾扬清正是其中的一个。
    从曾扬清十余年中发生的变化，联想到目前国营工业企业里党的和行政的领导工作同志，他们过去并不是搞工业的，为什么今天却能有成效地领导着工业企业，倒是一件可以理解的事了。
