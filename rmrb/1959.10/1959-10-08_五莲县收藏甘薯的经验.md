Five Lian County in Shandong Province, a region with high sweet potato production, adhering to the spirit of "early action brings benefits" and striving forward, has been actively strengthening preparations for storage while focusing on late-stage management of sweet potatoes. This involves extensively mobilizing the masses to summarize and utilize experience in sweet potato storage, ensuring a bumper harvest for every sweet potato.

The county plants approximately 250,000 mu of sweet potatoes annually. The people have accumulated relatively rich experience in sweet potato storage, generally achieving no diseased potatoes and minimal losses each year. Some communes can even store fresh sweet potatoes without spoilage until the new sweet potatoes are harvested the following year.

Five Lian County's basic experiences in storing sweet potatoes are twofold: good harvesting and good storage. Good harvesting: First, make good storage preparations, such as digging cellars in advance, organizing labor, selecting locations for drying sweet potato slices, etc., ensuring that tools are available, work is organized, there is protection from rain, and storage is possible after harvest. Second, harvest at the appropriate time. Failure to pay attention to the appropriate timing for harvesting may result in losses due to frost or rain. According to Five Lian County's experience, the best time for harvesting sweet potatoes is from "Cold Dew" to "Frost's Descent." Fresh potatoes harvested during this period can generally yield six liang of dried sweet potato slices per jin, while near or after "Frost's Descent," each jin of fresh potatoes can only yield four or five liang of dried sweet potato slices. This is because some of the starch is converted into sugar, the potatoes are larger, but the starch content is lower. Late harvesting also has other disadvantages, such as difficulty in drying, which is not conducive to fresh storage, etc. During the harvest period, special attention should be paid to weather changes. When the northwest wind rises and the autumn sun shines, it is a great opportunity to rush the sweet potato harvest. To prevent possible frost, special attention should be paid to the order of harvesting sweet potatoes. Every year, they follow the saying "snow falls on high mountains, frost strikes low-lying areas," harvesting low-lying areas before upland fields. If the harvest period encounters rain, the vines are cut off and soil is piled on the mounds to prevent frost damage.

Sweet potato storage: divided into dry storage and fresh storage. Fresh potato storage is the most arduous task, and if storage is not done well, it is easy to rot. Five Lian County's solution to these problems is: strengthen the careful harvesting and selection work before storage. Be especially careful when harvesting so as not to damage the potatoes. After the sweet potatoes are dug out, they should be dried for a short period and then selected. Damaged, skinned, or spotted potatoes should be removed and sliced for drying or kept for fresh consumption and cannot be stored for long periods. Selected sweet potatoes must be selected again before storage to avoid bringing potatoes damaged during transportation into the cellar. Two: Strengthen post-storage management. In Five Lian County, the main method for storing fresh sweet potatoes is cellar storage, followed by kang storage and storage in stacked baskets. Regardless of the method used, dry soil or fine sand should be spread to keep the sweet potatoes dry and prevent the spread of disease. The suitable temperature for storing sweet potatoes is between 11 and 16 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is higher than 18 degrees or lower than 9 degrees, good results will not be obtained.

Many typical examples in this county prove that as long as the above methods are comprehensively applied, sweet potatoes can be stored well. The Nuozhuang Production Team of the Hongning Commune has never had any stored sweet potatoes spoil for more than a decade, and the storage period can last for nearly a year.

Currently, the people's communes in Five Lian County are using existing sweet potato storage experience to carry out extensive preparatory work. More than 200,000 sickles and hoes needed for harvesting sweet potatoes in the county have been properly prepared. Of the 5,850 sweet potato slicers used for slicing and drying, more than 4,800 have been prepared. At the same time, many communes have arranged for blacksmiths and carpenters needed to repair harvesting and slicing tools during the harvest period. Some communes have also formulated sweet potato harvesting plans and convened technical exchange meetings to promote storage experience, ensuring that this year's sweet potatoes are harvested and stored well.

    五莲县收藏甘薯的经验
    曹学璞
    种植甘薯较多的山东省五莲县，本着“一早百好”一切向前赶的精神，在大抓甘薯后期管理的同时，广泛发动群众总结运用收藏甘薯的经验，积极加强收藏准备，以便做到块块甘薯丰产丰收。
    这个县每年种植甘薯二十五万亩左右，群众对甘薯收藏已经积累了比较丰富的经验，年年都能做到基本上无病薯无损失，有的公社鲜藏的甘薯到来年新甘薯下来也不腐烂。
    五莲县收藏甘薯的基本经验是两条，即收好，藏好。收好：首先是做好收藏准备，如事先挖好薯窖，组织好劳动力，选择好晒薯干的地点等等，作到工具应用尽有，干活不乱，雨来有防，收后能藏。其次是适时收刨。收刨不注意适当时机，就可能因受霜冻或阴雨造成损失。五莲县的经验，甘薯收刨期以“寒露”到“霜降”为最好。在这一时期收刨的鲜薯一般每斤可晒薯干六两，而到接近“霜降”或“霜降”以后，每斤鲜薯只能晒薯干四、五两，这是因为有些淀粉转化为糖，薯块大了，但淀粉少了。收获晚了还有另外的缺点，如不易晒干，不利鲜藏等等。在收获期间还应特别注意天气变化情况，每逢西北风起，秋阳普照的时候，是抢收甘薯的大好时机。为了防御可能发生的霜冻，还应该特别注意收刨甘薯的先后次序。他们每年都根据“雪下高山，霜打洼”这一谚语，先收洼地后收岭田。如果收获期遇到阴雨，就割下薯蔓在墩上培土防止冻害。
    甘薯的贮藏：分干藏和鲜藏两种。鲜薯储藏工作最艰巨，贮藏不好，容易腐烂。五莲县解决这些问题的办法是：加强贮藏前的细收精选工作，在收刨的时候要特别细心，不伤害薯块。甘薯刨出以后，要经过短时期晾晒，然后进行挑选。对刨坏、伤皮、有斑点的甘薯，一律剔除，切片晒干或者留作鲜食，不能长期贮存。选好的甘薯，在贮藏前还要挑选一次，以免将搬运时所碰伤的薯块带入窖内。二：加强藏后管理。五莲县对于鲜甘薯的贮藏方法，主要是窖藏，其次是炕藏和用垛篓贮藏。不管用那一种方法，存放时都要铺撒干土或细沙，以保持甘薯干燥，避免发病传染。贮藏甘薯的适宜气温是摄氏十一度到十六度之间，如果气温高过十八度或低于九度，都不会获得良好效果。
    这个县的许多典型事例证明，只要综合兼施上述办法，完全可以将甘薯收藏好。洪凝公社挪庄生产队，十几年来贮藏的甘薯从来没有坏过，而且贮藏期可长达将近一年。
    现在，五莲县各人民公社正在运用已有的甘薯收藏经验进行广泛的准备工作。全县收刨甘薯所需的二十多万把镰、镢，已经准备妥善。切片晒干用的五千八百五十部甘薯切片机，已经准备好四千八百多部。同时不少公社对收获期间修理收刨切片工具所需要的红炉和木工都作了安排。有的公社还制订了甘薯收刨计划，召开了技术交流会，推广收藏经验，保证做到今年的甘薯收好、藏好。
