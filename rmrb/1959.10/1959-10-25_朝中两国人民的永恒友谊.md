The Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People
He Yangtian, Chairman of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association

Today, the Korean people commemorate the ninth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War and the first anniversary of their withdrawal from Korea with extreme gratitude.

The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean War infinitely inspired our people and our People's Army, who were engaged in a bloody struggle against a vicious enemy, and brought about a fundamental change in the Korean war situation that was favorable to us.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in close coordination, inflicted devastating blows on those who invaded the northern half of our country and drove them out of the entire territory of the northern half of the Republic.

Faced with the great strength of the closely united Chinese and Korean peoples, the American imperialists, who suffered repeated defeats, continued to mobilize powerful forces in an attempt to launch another counterattack. However, the enemy's sinister schemes were finally shattered by the Chinese and Korean peoples. The enemy not only failed to realize their aggressive ambitions but were also forced to sign the armistice agreement. The Korean War, which lasted for more than three years, was one of the most intense and brutal wars in history. In such an extremely cruel war, the collective heroism displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples became a living example of proletarian internationalism, forever inspiring the people of the world to fight for peace and socialism.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, participating in the Korean War, together with the Korean People's Army, defended every hill and every village in Korea with blood, inflicting severe blows on the armed aggressors militarily.

The battle of Shangganling in October 1952 was one of the most intense battles. Facing two hills with an area of only four square kilometers, the enemy mobilized more than 50,000 troops and a large amount of military supplies, pouring 250,000 to 300,000 shells every day, launching a fierce offensive. However, in the fierce battle that lasted for 43 days, the volunteer soldiers annihilated more than half of the enemy's forces and defended their positions from beginning to end. In this battle, the hero Huang Jiguang resolutely blocked the enemy's firing point with his chest. All the volunteer soldiers, with this thorough proletarian internationalist spirit, dedicated everything to the victory of the Korean people and displayed unprecedented collective heroism.

During the two years and nine months of participation in the Korean War, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army produced many collective meritorious units, combat heroes, combat models, and hundreds of thousands of various meritorious personnel.

The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, educated and cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, are soldiers with noble character praised by the people of the world.

The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also formed a close relationship of mutual love and mutual assistance with the people in our rear.

Taking advantage of breaks in combat, the volunteer soldiers helped our farmers cultivate, sow, and harvest the land; and under the barbaric bombing of American imperialist planes, they rescued the lives and property of our people, regardless of danger, and at the same time, they took out their own military rations and daily necessities to help many war victims. Luo Shengjiao, a 21-year-old young soldier, sacrificed his precious life to save the life of a Korean boy. These countless touching deeds of the volunteer soldiers will forever live in the hearts of our people.

The 650 million Chinese people, together with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, actively assisted us, the Korean people. The Chinese people sent large amounts of grain and other relief supplies every year and nurtured more than 20,000 Korean orphans who had lost their parents due to the barbaric atrocities of the American-Li gang, as if they were their own children.

The war finally ended with the victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples.

The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean War not only established immortal feats in ensuring the victory of the Korean people and restoring peace in Korea, but also made a great contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

After the war, our situation was extremely difficult. We had to rebuild our homeland on ruins. At this time, the Chinese people once again extended a helping hand to us, providing us with free assistance of more than 800 million yuan. After the war, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with our People's Army, firmly defended our peaceful frontier and actively assisted the socialist construction of our people. They built countless houses, schools, and public buildings for us, and restored and built many bridges and irrigation facilities. The noble assistance given to us by the Chinese people plays a huge role in the struggle of our people to create a new life and blossoms beautiful flowers in the happy life of our people.

One year ago today, our people, with boundless excitement, bid farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, our close comrades-in-arms who had shared life and death and shared weal and woe with us for eight years. Our people deeply realize how great the vitality of the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples is! Because of this, our people infinitely cherish this friendship and unity.

Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out during his visit to China last December: "This friendship and unity can only be generated among people who are closely united with common ideals and common goals in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. There is no friendship more friendly than this! There is no unity more powerful than this!"

The continuous strengthening of the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples is not only an important guarantee for further promoting our socialist construction and the peaceful reunification of our motherland, but also a great force for completely driving out imperialist aggression from the East and maintaining lasting peace in Asia. Today, both our peoples are continuously winning victories and continuously leaping forward towards a bright future. Our people are extremely happy to regard all the glorious victories of the Chinese brothers as their own victories.

Not long ago, the people of the world celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and excitement. Under the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in socialist construction.

The Chinese people have completed the socialist transformation of cities and rural areas in a short period of time, and have also enabled 500 million working farmers to join people's communes, rapidly developing rural productive forces.

Today, the Great Leap Forward movement launched by the Chinese people following the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Chinese Communist Party powerfully demonstrates to the people of the world the infinite and great creativity of the Chinese people. New miracles appear every day on the vast land of China; the technological revolution and the cultural revolution are proceeding victoriously.

China is transforming into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Our people fully support the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement launched by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and are confident that they will achieve even more brilliant victories in the future.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people, inspired by the great victories of the Chinese people, have made great achievements in socialist construction.

We have transformed our motherland into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with an independent economic foundation, and are advancing towards a great future with the spirit of Chollima, in order to build our motherland into a developed socialist industrial country in the near future.

The Chollima movement of our people and the Great Leap Forward movement of the Chinese people show the indomitable fighting spirit and infinite strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples in striving for the prosperity of their motherlands and building a new socialist East, and further strengthen the great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Today, on the Earth, peace and socialism are advancing from victory to victory, while imperialism is heading towards irreparable destruction.

However, the old forces are unwilling to fail, and they are still struggling there, trying to hinder our progress.

On this day, exactly one year after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army voluntarily withdrew from Korea, the American imperialists are still occupying the southern half of our country, implementing colonial plunder policies; they are also occupying the indivisible Chinese territory - Taiwan. However, this is only the death throes of the imperialists. The forces of peace and socialism have overwhelmed the forces of imperialism. The people of all countries in the powerful socialist camp are united under the banner of proletarian internationalism, advancing victoriously along the road pointed out by Marxism-Leninism. Today, no force can stop their victorious advance. Our cause is just, and victory will surely belong to us.

In the struggle against a common enemy, we will further strengthen the unity of the peoples of the two countries in order to completely drive imperialism out of the East and strive for the final victory of the freedom, independence, peace, and socialism of our motherlands.

The joint statement issued by the governments of China and Korea in February 1958 pointed out: "Any aggression by imperialism against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Chinese people have not ignored in the past, and will never ignore in the future." In the struggle against a common enemy, our people are determined to fight alongside the Chinese people forever.

Today, on the occasion of commemorating the ninth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War, the Korean people would like to extend their most sincere gratitude to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and to all the Chinese people, and wish the fraternal Chinese people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building a great socialist China!

    朝中两国人民的永恒友谊
    朝中友好协会委员长　河仰天
    今天，朝鲜人民怀着极其感激的心情，纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝参战九周年和志愿军撤离朝鲜一周年。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争，无限地鼓舞了同凶恶的敌人进行浴血斗争的我国人民和我们的人民军队，使朝鲜战局起了有利于我们的根本变化。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，以紧密的协同作战，给予那些侵犯我国北半部的敌人以歼灭性的打击，并且从共和国北半部的整个土地上把他们赶出去。
    在紧密团结的朝中两国人民的伟大力量面前，不断遭到惨败的美帝国主义者，继续调动强大的兵力，企图再一次进行反扑。但是，敌人的凶恶的阴谋诡计，终于被朝中两国人民粉碎了。敌人不但没有实现自己的侵略野心，反而被迫在停战协定上签了字。经历三年多的朝鲜战争，是历史上最激烈而残酷的一次战争。在这样极其残酷的战争中，中国人民志愿军所发挥的集体英雄主义精神和朝中两国人民之间的战斗友谊，成为永远鼓舞全世界人民为和平和社会主义而斗争的无产阶级国际主义的活生生的榜样。
    参加朝鲜战争的中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民军一道，用鲜血捍卫了朝鲜的每一座高地和每一个村庄，从军事上给予武装侵略者以严重的打击。
    1952年10月，在上甘岭进行的战斗，是一次最激烈的战斗。敌人面对着只不过有四平方公里面积的两座高地，调动五万多兵力和大批军需器材，每天倾泻了二十五万到三十万发炮弹，展开了猛烈的进犯。但是，志愿军勇士们在四十三天之久的激战中，歼灭了半数以上的敌军兵力，自始至终坚守了自己的阵地。在这次战斗中，黄继光英雄毅然地用自己的胸膛堵住了敌人的火力点。所有志愿军勇士们都以这种彻底的无产阶级国际主义精神，为了朝鲜人民的胜利而献出一切，发挥了史无前例的集体英雄主义精神。
    在参加朝鲜战争的两年零九个月中，中国人民志愿军涌现了许多集体功臣单位、战斗英雄、战斗模范以及几十万各种功臣。
    为毛泽东同志和中国共产党所教育和培养的中国人民志愿军勇士们，都是世界人民所赞扬的、具有高尚品德的战士。
    中国人民志愿军勇士们同我国后方人民之间也结成了互相爱护、互相协助亲密的骨肉关系。
    志愿军勇士们利用战斗空隙，帮助我国农民耕地、播种和收割；并且在美帝国主义的飞机的野蛮轰炸下，不顾危险，救出了我国人民的生命和财产，同时拿出自己的军粮和日用品，救济了众多的战争灾民。二十一岁的青年战士罗盛教，为了救出我国少年的生命，献出了自己宝贵的生命。志愿军勇士们的这些数不尽的可歌可泣的业绩，永远活在我国人民的心里。
    六亿五千万中国人民，同英雄的中国人民志愿军一道，积极援助了我们朝鲜人民。中国人民每年送来大量的粮食和其他救济物资，并且像亲骨肉般地抚育了因美李匪帮的野蛮暴行而丧失了父母的两万多名我国孤儿。
    战争终于以朝中两国人民的胜利而结束了。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争，不仅在保障朝鲜人民的胜利和恢复朝鲜和平方面建立了不朽的功勋，而且在维护远东和世界和平方面也是一个巨大的贡献。
    战后，我国的处境是异常艰苦的。我们必须在一片废墟上重建家园。这时，中国人民又向我们伸出援助的手，提供了达八亿元人民币之多的无偿援助。战后，中国人民志愿军又同我们人民军一道，坚定地捍卫了我国的和平防线，积极援助了我国人民的社会主义建设。他们为我们建设了无数住宅、学校和公共建筑，恢复和建设了许多桥梁和灌溉设备。中国人民给予我们的崇高援助，在我国人民创造新生活的斗争中起着巨大的作用，在我国人民的幸福生活中开放着美丽的花朵。
    在一年前的今天，我国人民以无限激动的心情，欢送了八年来曾经和我们同生死、共患难的亲密战友——中国人民志愿军。我国人民深深地体会到，朝中两国人民的友谊团结具有着多么伟大的生命力！正因为这样，我国人民无限地珍视这种友谊和团结。
    金日成同志在去年12月访问中国时曾经指出：“这种友谊和团结，是只能在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，以共同的思想和共同的目标紧密团结起来的人民之间才能产生的。再也没有比这种友谊更加友好的了！再也没有比这种团结更加有力的了！”
    朝中两国人民的友谊团结的不断加强，不仅是进一步促进我们的社会主义建设和和平统一祖国的重要保证，而且是从东方彻底驱逐帝国主义侵略势力、维护亚洲持久和平的巨大力量。今天，我们两国人民都在不断地胜利，不断地向着光明的未来飞跃前进。我国人民把中国兄弟们的一切光辉胜利当做自己的胜利，感到万分高兴。
    不久前，全世界人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年。中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了伟大的胜利。
    中国人民在短期内完成了城市和农村的社会主义改造，而且使五亿劳动农民加入了人民公社，迅速地发展了农村的生产力。
    今天，中国人民遵循着中国共产党提出的社会主义建设总路线所展开的大跃进运动，向全世界人民有力地显示了中国人民的无穷无尽的伟大创造力。在广阔的中国土地上，每天都有新的奇迹出现；技术革命和文化革命正在胜利地进行着。
    中国正在转变成具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的社会主义强国。我国人民全面支持中国人民在中国共产党的领导下展开的大跃进运动和人民公社化运动，并且确信他们今后将取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，朝鲜人民为中国人民的伟大胜利所鼓舞，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。
    我们已使我们的祖国转变成为具有自主经济基础的社会主义工业—农业国家，并为在最近的将来把自己的祖国建设成发达的社会主义工业国，以跨上千里马的气概向着伟大的未来前进。
    我国人民的千里马运动和中国人民的大跃进运动，显示出朝中两国人民在为自己祖国的繁荣和建设新的社会主义东方所发挥的不屈不挠的斗志和无穷无尽的力量，并进一步增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大力量。
    今天，在地球上，和平和社会主义正在从胜利走向胜利，而帝国主义正在走向无可挽救的灭亡。
    可是，旧势力不甘心失败，他们还在那里作垂死的挣扎，企图阻碍我们前进。
    在中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜后整整一年的今天，美帝国主义者仍然强占我国南半部，实行殖民地掠夺政策；他们还强占着不可分割的中国领土——台湾。然而，这只不过是帝国主义者在那里作垂死挣扎而已。和平和社会主义力量已经压倒帝国主义势力。强大的社会主义阵营各国人民正团结在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，沿着马克思列宁主义所指引的道路胜利前进。今天，没有任何力量可以阻挡他们胜利前进。我们的事业是正义的，胜利一定属于我们。
    我们在反对共同敌人的斗争中，将进一步加强两国人民的团结，以便把帝国主义从东方完全驱逐出去，争取祖国的自由、独立、和平和社会主义的最后胜利。
    朝中两国政府在1958年2月发表的联合声明中指出：“帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的任何侵犯，中国人民过去没有，今后也绝对不会置之不理。”我国人民在对共同敌人的斗争中，决心永远同中国人民一道共同奋斗。
    今天，在纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝参战九周年之际，朝鲜人民谨向中国人民志愿军全体官兵和全中国人民，致以最热诚的谢意，并谨祝兄弟般的中国人民在为建设伟大的社会主义中国的事业中取得更辉煌的成就！
