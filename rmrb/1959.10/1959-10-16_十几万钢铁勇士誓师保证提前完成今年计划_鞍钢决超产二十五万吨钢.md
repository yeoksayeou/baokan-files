Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 15th: The hundreds of thousands of iron and steel workers of the steel capital Anshan, based on the current excellent production situation, have put forward new and more inspiring combat goals: to guarantee the early completion of this year's national steel production plan, and to overproduce 250,000 tons of steel for the country throughout the year; to guarantee the early completion of this year's national steel production plan, and to overproduce 400,000 tons of steel for the country throughout the year; and at the same time, to complete and overfulfill the annual national plans for pig iron, ore, coke, and refractory materials ahead of schedule.

This new production target of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers was proposed at the city-wide workers' oath-taking broadcast meeting held at the old Anshan Stadium on the afternoon of the 14th. In addition to the more than 70,000 people at the central venue, 280,000 workers and citizens listened to the live broadcast of the meeting. After in-depth anti-Rightist struggle, boosting morale, and launching a mass movement, the production leap forward situation in Anshan Iron and Steel Company is getting better and better, and the production level has been rising. From September 1st to October 12th, the average daily steel production increased by 1,341 tons compared with August, the average daily iron production increased by 1,453 tons compared with August, and the average daily steel production increased by 278 tons compared with August. Today, as these iron and steel warriors who have won successive battles are vowing to advance towards greater victories, everyone is full of fighting spirit and high morale, and full of confidence in completing the new production increase plan.

At the beginning of the meeting, Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, addressed the workers. He analyzed the current leap forward situation in Anshan. He said that the fourth quarter production plan of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a plan for continued great leap forward. The city's workers must seize the current excellent opportunity to continue to oppose Rightist tendencies, boost morale, carry out mass movements in depth, launch technical performance competitions, focus on various technical measures, overcome weak links, overcome all difficulties, seize every second, not give up a single inch of steel, and do everything possible to complete and overfulfill this year's national plans for steel, steel, and pig iron ahead of schedule. At the same time, in the fourth quarter, we must do a good job in preparing for next year's production to ensure continued great leap forward next year.

Yuan Zhen, First Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China and Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the leaders of the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Anshan Municipal Women's Federation also spoke. They expressed their warm response to the Party's call on behalf of all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the people of the city, and resolved to achieve the new production increase plan of Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

Representatives from various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company rushed to the meeting to put forward guarantee conditions, forming a hot wave of challenges, responses, oaths, and competitions. The first to run up to the rostrum among the representatives of various factories and mines was Meng Tai, Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant and a well-known national labor model. On behalf of all the workers in the plant, he said that it is necessary to break through the four key points of scheduling, transportation, equipment maintenance, and furnace operation, and carry out a great leap forward in production in October, increasing the production of 30,000 tons of high-quality pig iron for the country throughout the month, and ensuring the early completion of the annual pig iron production task. As soon as Meng Tai finished speaking, the representatives of the various steelmaking plants ran to the loudspeaker one after another, representing all the steelmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to express their determination to the Party that they must resolutely oppose Rightist tendencies, greatly boost morale, continue to carry out technical performance competitions, innovate operating techniques, implement the open hearth operating policy of "more charging, fast smelting, high temperature, and long life," and fully tap the internal potential of the enterprise to ensure the completion of the task of increasing the production of 250,000 tons of high-quality steel for the country throughout the year. Zhai Junjia, Deputy Director of the Large Rolling Mill, proposed on behalf of all the workers in the plant to ensure that the production level in the fourth quarter will be increased by 25% compared with the third quarter, to ensure that the annual production of large steel will be increased by 20,000 to 25,000 tons, and to achieve high quality, low consumption, multiple varieties, and safe production. Zhao Zhen'en, an advanced producer of the First Primary Rolling Mill, said on behalf of all the workers in his factory that he would fight hard in the fourth quarter, resolutely break through the three barriers of accidents, gas, and raw materials, achieve hourly red, shift-by-shift red, and day-by-day red, and ensure that the annual production of 150,000 tons of high-quality steel billets is increased to support the proposal of various brother rolling mills to achieve an increase in the production of 400,000 tons of steel. In order to ensure the realization of the task of increasing steel production, the representatives of basic construction, mining, transportation, construction, refractory materials, and machine repair systems unanimously guaranteed to fully support steel production. Representatives of local industry and state-owned stores also expressed their determination to support Anshan Iron and Steel Company's increase in steel production at the meeting.

The call issued at the oath-taking meeting and the determination of the representatives immediately turned into the practical actions of the broad masses of workers. The workers of the Third Steelmaking Plant worked harder and more skillfully, and produced five furnaces of rapid steelmaking on the day of the oath-taking meeting. The workers of No. 9 blast furnace, whose blast furnace utilization coefficient had reached 2.334 in the first three days of October, immediately launched a technical performance competition for rapid iron tapping and slag tapping in front of the furnace after the broadcast meeting, and resolved to increase the blast furnace utilization coefficient to more than 2.6 in the next few days. The maintenance workers of Class B of the First Medium Plate Mill completed the minor repair task of changing rolls, which was originally planned to take five hours, half an hour ahead of schedule, and guaranteed the quality.

　　十几万钢铁勇士誓师保证提前完成今年计划
    鞍钢决超产二十五万吨钢
    据新华社鞍山15日电　钢都鞍山的十几万钢铁大军，根据当前生产的大好形势，提出了新的更加激奋人心的战斗目标：保证提前完成今年国家钢产量计划，全年为国家超产二十五万吨钢；保证提前完成今年国家钢材产量计划，全年为国家超产四十万吨钢材；同时相应地提前超额完成今年生铁、矿石、焦炭、耐火材料等产品的全年国家计划。
    鞍钢职工这项新的增产指标，是14日下午在鞍山老体育场举行的全市职工誓师广播大会上提出的。参加大会的除中心会场的七万多人外，还有二十八万名职工和市民收听了大会的实况广播。经过深入地反右倾、鼓干劲和大搞群众运动，鞍钢的生产跃进形势越来越好，生产水平一直上升。从9月1日到10月12日，钢平均每天比8月份多产一千三百四十一吨，铁平均每天比8月份多产一千四百五十三吨，钢材平均每天比8月份多产二百七十八吨。今天，当这些连战连捷的钢铁勇士誓师向着更大的胜利前进的时候，人人斗志昂扬，个个意气风发，对完成新的增产计划充满了信心。
    大会开始时，中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰向职工们讲了话。他分析了鞍山当前的跃进形势。他说，鞍钢第四季度的生产计划是一个继续大跃进的计划，全市职工要抓住当前大好时机继续反右倾、鼓干劲，深入地开展群众运动，大搞技术表演赛，狠抓各项技术措施，克服薄弱环节，战胜一切困难，分秒必争，寸钢不让，千方百计的提前和超额完成今年的钢、钢材和生铁的国家计划。同时，在第四季度内，一定要做好明年的生产准备工作，保证明年继续大跃进。
    中共鞍钢委员会第一书记、鞍钢经理袁振和鞍山市工会、共青团鞍山市委、鞍山市妇联的负责人也都讲了话。他们代表鞍钢全体职工和全市人民表示热烈响应党的号召，决心实现鞍钢新的增产计划。
    鞍钢各厂矿的代表争先恐后地向大会提出保证条件，形成了挑战应战誓师比武热潮。各厂矿代表中最先跑上主席台的是鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长、全国著名劳动模范孟泰。他代表全厂职工表示要大破调度运输、设备维护和炉内外操作等四大关键，在10月份来个生产大跃进，全月为国家增产三万吨优质生铁，保证提前完成全年生铁生产任务。孟泰的话音刚落，各炼钢厂的代表，又都先后跑到扩音器前，代表鞍钢全体炼钢职工向党表示决心，一定要狠反右倾、大鼓干劲、继续开展技术表演竞赛，革新操作技术，贯彻“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”平炉操作方针，充分挖掘企业内部潜力，保证完成全年为国家增产二十五万吨优质钢的任务。大型轧钢厂的副厂长翟俊家代表全厂职工提出，保证第四季度的生产水平要比第三季度提高25％，确保全年增产大型钢材两万到两万五千吨，并且做到优质、低耗、多品种和安全生产。第一初轧厂的先进生产者赵振恩，代表他工厂的全体职工表示要大战四季度，坚决突破事故、煤气、原料三关，作到小时红、班班红、日日红，保证全年增产十五万吨优质钢坯，支援各兄弟轧钢厂实现增产四十万吨钢材的倡议。为了保证实现钢铁增产任务，基本建设、矿山、运输、修建、耐火材料、机修等系统的代表一致保证要全力支援钢铁生产。地方工业和国营商店的代表也都在会上表示了支援鞍钢增产钢铁产品的决心。
    誓师大会上发出的号召和代表们的决心，立即变成了广大职工的实际行动。第三炼钢厂职工劲上加劲、巧上加巧，在举行誓师大会当天就出了五炉快速炼钢。10月头三天已使高炉利用系数达到二点三三四的九号高炉职工，广播大会后，立即开展了炉前快速出铁、出渣技术表演赛，决心在最近几天把高炉利用系数提高到二点六以上。第一中板厂乙班检修工人把原计划要五小时才能作完的换辊小修任务，提前半小时就完成了，而且保证了质量。
