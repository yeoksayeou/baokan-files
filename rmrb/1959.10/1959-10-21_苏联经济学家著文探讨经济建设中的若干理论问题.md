Soviet Economists Publish Articles Discussing Several Theoretical Issues in Economic Construction

As the Soviet Union entered a period of comprehensively expanding communist construction, many new economic problems were brought to the agenda and needed to be theoretically demonstrated. Soviet economists have written many articles on these issues that have both theoretical and practical significance. Most of these articles have been published in the "Economic Translation Series" magazine. Here is a brief introduction to some of the papers recently published in the Economic Translation Series. Some articles have already been introduced in the People's Daily and will be omitted here.

	The Law of Value and Planning Work

The characteristics of the law of value's role and its manifestations under planned economic conditions have not yet been well resolved and require further study. Academician Strumilin, in his article "The Law of Value and Planning Work" (Translation Series, Issue 9), put forward his views on these issues. He believes that compared with the law of value under capitalist conditions, its manifestations under socialist conditions have the following seven characteristics: (1) it is free from the influence of spontaneous forces and obeys the plans of socialist society, appearing directly in the form of planning instructions from this society; (2) in a planned economy, the law of value is used in a planned and direct way to adjust the proportions of productive labor, coordinating it with labor balance sheets and balance sheets of production and consumption of various products, so here the production ratio determines the exchange ratio; (3) in a planned economy, prices are determined by the people themselves, and their deviation from value does not depend on the requirements of social production, and there is nothing to prevent the realization of the principle of equivalence, so this requirement of the law of value can be fully realized; (4) under socialist conditions, the law of value can help us accelerate the speed of technological progress; (5) the spontaneous law of value makes people only pursue the highest profit rate when choosing new investment projects, while the law of value consciously utilized by people makes us take the lowest consumption of materialized labor and living labor as the criterion when choosing investment projects; (6) the spontaneous law of value always plays a role after the proportions of the national economy are disrupted, while the law of value consciously utilized by us in planning work can enable us to prevent imbalances and save the national economy from huge losses and disasters; (7) the spontaneous law of value is expressed in the shell of purely material relations and is an objective necessity imposed on people from the outside, while the law of value used by us in planning activities unreservedly reflects people's social relations in production, and its role is directly related to the consciously applied principle of saving labor time, in other words, acting in accordance with the requirements of the law of value is because this requirement is reasonable.

Academician Strumilin also talked about the issue of "transformation" of laws in this article. He believes that "various historical laws are changing (the words 'change' and 'transform' are the same word in Russian – translator), and the changes in their manifestations do not obey the will of legislators, nor are they based on the instructions of 'magicians', but are changed under the influence of the great force of the replacement of the entire social formation. For example, due to capitalism's victory over feudalism, the law of value 'changed' into the 'law of production price'... and now in a new historical stage, due to socialism's victory over capitalism, this law of value has 'changed' into a new form, and also enables people to use this law in a planned way for the benefit of the entire socialist society."

Academician Strumilin's other paper, "Calculating Value and Applying Value under Socialist Conditions" (Translation Series, Issue 10), discusses the widespread application of value in national economic planning. Utilizing it can not only adjust labor time and proportionally allocate social labor according to production needs, but also reducing value can be used as a measure of investment effectiveness. Calculating the value of various products is very important for stipulating reasonable prices for these products, for calculating the necessary accumulation, ensuring the equivalence of exchange in domestic trade, and ensuring profitability in import and export. Many product calculation methods have been proposed in the Soviet Union, but most of them are too complex and difficult to adopt without reforming the current reporting system. The author proposes a simple and feasible method that can be used immediately by enterprises and national economic committees to calculate value using existing reports.

	Speed and Proportion Issues

In his article "On the Speed of Expanded Reproduction in the Period of Comprehensively Expanding Communist Construction" (Translation Series, Issue 7), Notkin analyzed the reasons for the changes in the rate of production development in the Soviet Union at various stages and discussed the growth trend of production speed in the period of comprehensively expanding communist construction.

The author believes that it is unfounded for bourgeois economists to apply the "law of diminishing returns" to socialist countries, attempting to prove that the growth rate of Soviet industrial production decreases as the annual output of industry increases. The author wrote: The Soviet Union's "first and second five-year plan periods had very high industrial production growth rates, because at that time the Soviet Union was in a condition of capitalist encirclement, and it had to establish a developed heavy industry in the shortest possible time... In the post-war period, great changes have taken place in the Soviet Union's domestic and international situation. The world socialist system has been formed and is increasingly consolidated. The recovery of the national economy and the new level of development reached by heavy industry have created objective conditions for the comprehensive and coordinated development of the entire national economy... It can be seen that the reason why the pre-war and post-war industrial growth rates are different is mainly because the distribution ratio of the accumulation fund in various departments of the national economy has changed." However, some people doubt that industry will continue to develop at a high speed under the comprehensive development of the entire national economy. The author believes that this doubt is unnecessary. He points out two extremely important conditions: the greater possibility of productive accumulation that appears with the improvement of the level of economic development, and the more effective utilization of material resources and labor resources. In this case, due to the large savings of living labor and past labor, the Soviet Union can not only maintain the current rate of expanded reproduction but also has the potential to increase it under higher economic development levels during the period of comprehensively expanding communist construction.

Another article on the issue of speed and proportion is Paul's "On Several Factors Determining the Speed and Proportion of Socialist Reproduction" (Translation Series, Issue 9). The author believes that the objectively attainable rate of reproduction over a longer period can be determined based on the following basic factors: (1) the proportion of national income in social product; (2) the proportion of accumulation fund in national income; (3) the proportion of production fund in accumulation fund; (4) the fund occupancy of products. The author calculated the development speed of social production by example. He said: Assuming that the proportion of national income in social product in the planning period is 0.5, the proportion of accumulation fund in national income is 0.25, the proportion of production fund in accumulation fund is 0.8, and the fund occupancy of social production is 1, then the speed of social production that can be achieved annually in the planning period is 10%.

The article "Capital Occupancy of Production and Its Potential for Reduction" in Translation Series, Issue 10, specifically discusses the issue of capital (fund) occupancy as a speed-determining factor. Reducing capital occupancy means producing more products with the least investment, and its impact on speed can be compared to increasing the accumulation rate. Under the current conditions of extremely large-scale investment, the issue of capital occupancy is an important political and economic issue. The author uses actual data to prove that the capital occupancy of various production departments in the United States in the past hundred years and in the Soviet Union in recent decades has shown a downward trend, refuting the widely circulated "law" of diminishing returns. The potential for reducing capital occupancy mainly lies in four aspects: actively changing the sectoral structure of the national economy, especially industry, such as giving priority to the development of synthetic materials production, adopting advanced thermal processing and chemical processing methods, etc.; achieving automation and adopting new technologies; improving the structure of capital construction, reducing costs and shortening construction periods; and improving the level of production organization and improving the proficiency of cadres. Making good use of these potentials is an important condition for quickly completing the Soviet Union's basic economic tasks, establishing the material and technical foundation of communism, and reaching the highest living standards in the world.

	Demand Exceeding Supply and Socialist Laws

In the Soviet Union, some economists and philosophers believe that demand with payment ability should exceed production, which is the law of socialism. Some people in our country's economic circles also advocate this view. Regarding this issue, two articles were published in the Translation Series (Issues 4 and 7, 1959). The authors of both articles disagree with the above viewpoint. For example, the author of the article "The Proportional Relationship between Demand with Payment Ability and Production under the Socialist System" (Issue 7) wrote that production lagging behind demand within the reach of purchasing power can only be a temporary phenomenon, and it contradicts the requirements of socialist objective economic laws. The monetary income distributed to workers according to labor should be equivalent to the total value of goods in the commercial network. Failing to fully meet the demand within the reach of purchasing power actually means disrupting the principle of equivalence in exchange, which damages the staff's concern for production development from personal material interests. Failure to fully meet the demand with payment ability also has an adverse impact on production. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to more strongly stimulate enterprises to expand and improve product varieties and improve product quality. The argument that the growth rate of monetary income must exceed production will create constant shortages of goods and give people the illusion that socialism is a system with limited consumer goods production capacity. The correct relationship between supply and demand should be that the output of consumer goods slightly exceeds the purchasing power of residents. The author also explained why the contradiction between demand within the reach of purchasing power being higher than production has existed in the Soviet Union for a long time.

### 苏联经济学家著文探讨经济建设中的若干理论问题

    苏联经济学家著文探讨经济建设中的若干理论问题
    苏联进入全面展开共产主义建设时期以后，许多新的经济问题被提到日程上来，必须从理论上加以论证。苏联经济学家们已就这些问题撰写了不少有理论和实践意义的文章。这些文章大部分已陆续刊登在“经济译丛”杂志上。这里把经济译丛最近几期发表的一些论文，作一简要的介绍。有些文章已在人民日报上作过介绍，这里就省略了。
      价值规律与计划工作
    价值规律在计划经济条件下的作用特点及其表现形式的问题，至今还没有很好解决，有待于进一步研究。斯特鲁米林院士在“价值规律和计划工作”一文（译丛第九期）里，对这些问题提出了自己的看法。他认为社会主义条件下的价值规律同资本主义条件下的比起来，它的表现形式有如下七个特点：（1）它摆脱了自发势力的影响，服从于社会主义社会的计划并直接以这个社会的计划指令的形式出现；（2）在计划经济中，价值规律是有计划地直接地被用来调整生产劳动的比例，使之与劳动平衡表，与各种产品的生产与消费平衡表协调一致，所以在这里生产比例是要决定交换比例的；（3）在计划经济中，价格是由人民自己规定的，它同价值的背离不取决于社会生产的要求，而且这里没有什么东西妨碍等价原则的实现，所以价值规律的这个要求可以得到充分实现；（4）在社会主义条件下，价值规律能帮助我们加快技术进步的速度；（5）自发的价值规律使人们在选择新的投资项目时只顾追逐最高利润率，而被人们有意识利用的价值规律使我们在选择投资项目时以最低的物化劳动与活劳动的消耗量为准则；（6）自发的价值规律总是在国民经济比例遭到破坏以后才发生作用，而在计划工作中被我们有意识利用的价值规律，能使我们防止比例失调，使国民经济免遭巨大损失和灾难；（7）自发的价值规律以纯粹物的关系的外壳表现出来，是由外部强加于人们头上的客观必然性，而被我们用于计划活动中的价值规律，则毫不掩盖地反映人们在生产中的社会关系，并且它的作用同自觉运用的节约劳动时间原则直接有关，换句话说，按照价值规律的要求办事，是因为这种要求是合理的。
    斯特鲁米林院士在这篇文章里还谈到规律的“改造”问题。他认为，“各种历史规律是在改变的（改变和改造在俄文中是一个字——译者），它们的表现形式的改变并不是听从立法者的意志，也不是按照‘魔师’的指点，而是在整个社会形态更替这种巨大力量的影响下改变的。例如，由于资本主义战胜封建主义，价值规律就
  ‘改变’成为‘生产价格规律’……而现在在新的历史阶段，由于社会主义战胜资本主义，使得这一个价值规律又‘改变’成为新的形式，也使得人们能有计划地利用这一规律为整个社会主义社会造福。”
    斯特鲁米林院士的另一篇论文“在社会主义条件下计算价值和运用价值的问题”（译丛第十期）论述了价值在国民经济计划工作中的广泛运用问题。利用它不仅可以调节劳动时间和根据生产需要按比例地分配社会劳动，而且降低价值也可以作为衡量投资效果的一个尺度。计算各种产品的价值，对于规定这些产品的合理价格、对于计算必需的积累、保证国内贸易中交换的等价性和保证进出口获得赢利都非常重要。产品计算方法在苏联已经提出过很多，但是绝大多数过于复杂，如不改革现行报表制度就很难采用。作者提出一个简便可行的方法，并且马上可以在企业和国民经济委员会利用现有报表计算出价值来。
        速度与比例问题
    诺特京在“论全面展开共产主义建设时期的扩大再生产速度”一文（译丛第七期）里，分析了苏联各个时期生产发展速度的变化原因，探讨了全面展开共产主义建设时期的生产速度的增长趋势。
    作者认为，资产阶级经济学家把“生产效率递减规律”套用在社会主义国家，企图证明苏联工业生产的增长速度随着工业年产量的增长而下降，这是毫无根据的。作者写道：苏联“第一个和第二个五年计划时期，工业生产增长速度非常高，这是因为当时苏联处于资本主义包围的条件下，它必须在最短时期内建立起发达的重工业……。战后时期，苏联国内与国外的形势发生很大变化。世界社会主义体系形成并日益巩固。国民经济的恢复以及重工业达到的新的发展水平，为全面地协调地发展整个国民经济创造了客观条件。……由此可见，战前和战后的工业增长速度之所以不同，主要是因为积累基金在国民经济各部门的分配比例发生了变化。”但是，有人怀疑在整个国民经济全面发展情况下工业会继续以高速度发展。作者认为这种怀疑是不必要的。他指出两个极重要的条件：随着经济发展水平的提高而出现的生产性积累的更大可能性，以及物质资源和劳动资源的更加有效的利用。在这种情况下，由于活劳动和过去劳动的大量节约，苏联在全面展开共产主义建设时期在更高的经济发展水平条件下，不仅能保持住现在的扩大再生产速度，而且有可能提高它。
    有关速度与比例问题的另一篇文章是保尔的“论决定社会主义再生产速度和比例的几个因素”（译丛第九期）。作者认为，客观上可能达到的较长时期的再生产速度，可以根据下列基本因素来确定：（1）国民收入在社会产品中的比重；（2）积累基金在国民收入中的比重；（3）生产基金在积累基金中的比重；（4）产品的基金占用量。作者举例计算了社会生产的发展速度，他说：假定计划期国民收入在社会产品中的比重为零点五，积累基金在国民收入中的比重为零点二五，生产基金在积累基金中的比重为零点八，社会生产的基金占用量为一，那末计划期的社会生产每年可能达到的速度是10％。
    译丛第十期“生产的资金占用量及其降低的潜力”一文专门论述了作为速度决定因素的资金（基金）占用量问题。降低资金占用量，就是用最少的投资生产更多的产品，它对速度的影响可以和提高积累率相比。在投资规模极为庞大的现今条件，资金占用量问题是重要的政治经济问题。作者根据实际资料证明近百年来美国和近几十年来苏联各生产部门的资金占用量都表现了下降趋势，驳倒了流传极广的效用递减“规律”。降低资金占用量的潜力主要有四个方面：积极改变国民经济的特别是工业的部门构成，如优先发展合成材料生产，采用先进的热加工和化学加工方法等；实现自动化和采用新技术；改进基本建设的构成、降低造价和缩短工期；提高生产组织水平和提高干部熟练程度。很好地利用这些潜力是迅速完成苏联基本经济任务、建立共产主义物质技术基础和达到世界最高生活水平的重要条件之一。
    求过于供与社会主义规律
    在苏联，有的经济学家和哲学家认为，有支付能力的需求应该超过生产，这是社会主义的规律性。我国经济学界也有人主张这种看法。关于这个问题，译丛上登载了两篇文章（1959年第四期和第七期）。这两篇文章的作者都不同意上述论点。例如，“社会主义制度下有支付能力的需求和生产的比例关系”一文（第七期）的作者写道，生产落后于购买力所及需求只能是暂时的现象，它同社会主义客观经济规律的要求是矛盾的。按照劳动分配给劳动者的货币收入，应相当于商业网中的商品总值。不能充分满足购买力所及需求，实际上意味着破坏交换中的等价原则，而这就损害了工作人员从个人物质利益上关心生产的发展。不能充分满足有支付能力的需求，对生产也有不利影响。在这种情况下不能更有力地刺激企业扩大和改善产品品种，以及提高产品质量。认为货币收入的增长速度必须超过生产的这种论点，会造成经常的商品不足，会给人一种似乎社会主义是消费品生产能力有限的一种制度的错觉。正确的供求关系应该是消费品的产量稍微超过居民的购买力。作者还说明了为什么苏联长期以来存在购买力所及需求高于生产的矛盾现象。
