　　Large Saw Blade Grinder
    Can Sharpen Large Circular Saw Blades with a Diameter of Two Meters
    Workers at the Wuhan Machine Tool Plant have produced China's first M6620 large saw blade grinder.
    The saw blade grinder is a special machine tool for sharpening saw blades used to cut large steel materials and steel ingots, and is one of the urgently needed machine tools for the development of heavy machinery manufacturing industry. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers of this factory broke with superstition and adopted the method of "three-way combination" of factory director, engineering and technical personnel, and veteran workers. While studying the drawings, they trial-produced, and after many experiments, they independently designed and manufactured two M6620 saw blade grinders in only twenty days. The grinding mechanism of this kind of grinder is fully automated, and it can sharpen large circular saw blades with a diameter of two meters. It can sharpen the front cutting edge, back cutting edge, and chamfer of the saw teeth, and can also perform intermittent grinding of the teeth, and can grind forty-seven to seventy-four teeth per minute.

　　大型锯片磨床
    能刃磨直径两米的大圆锯片
    武汉机床厂职工制成了我国第一台M6620大型锯片磨床。
    锯片磨床是刃磨切断大型钢材、钢锭用的锯片的专用机床，是发展重型机械制造工业中急需的机床之一。这个厂的职工在党的领导下，破除了迷信，采用厂长、工程技术人员、老工人“三结合”的办法，边研究图纸，边试制，经过多次试验，只用了二十多天的时间，便自行设计制成了两台M6620型锯片磨床。这种磨床的磨刃机构完全是自动化，能刃磨直径二米的大圆锯片，可以刃磨锯齿的前刃面、后刃面和倒角，并可进行间隔磨齿，每分钟可磨制齿四十七到七十四个。
