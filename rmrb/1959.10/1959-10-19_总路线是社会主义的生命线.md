The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is a line that fully reflects the superiority of the socialist economic system, and fully estimates the objective possibilities and the subjective dynamic role of the 650 million people. This Marxist-Leninist line, once combined with the masses, becomes a tremendous material force, invincible and all-conquering, creating earth-shaking miracles. It can be said without exaggeration that without the general line, there would have been no great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958 and the continued leap forward in the first three quarters of this year. Therefore, the general line has been warmly supported by the people of the whole country, who regard it as a bright lighthouse, as the concentrated expression of the determination and will of the 650 million people. On the other hand, it has also been attacked and slandered by reactionaries at home and abroad. These people trembled at the sound of the Chinese people's majestic steps, felt that the hope of re-enslaving the Chinese people was increasingly shattered, and therefore flew into a rage and launched vicious attacks. The contrast between the warm support of the people of the whole country and the vicious attacks of enemies at home and abroad tells us whose interests the general line represents and whose interests it violates. From this, we can more clearly distinguish who are in favor of the socialist revolution and who are against it.

Right-leaning opportunists do not necessarily oppose the Party's general line in words, but in reality, they are in harmony with enemies at home and abroad, jointly attacking and slandering the Party's general line. The general line requires socialist construction to be greater, faster, better, and more economical, striving for high speed; they, on the other hand, use the excuse of better and more economical to oppose greater and faster, oppose high speed, believing that this is risky and that is unstable. The general line requires going all out, aiming high, and vigorously developing mass movements; they slacken the masses' efforts, deflate the masses' spirit, stand outside the mass movements, point fingers, nitpick, and even slander the mass movements as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" with a bourgeois master-like attitude. Therefore, the divergence between us and the right-leaning opportunists is not a divergence on individual issues, but a divergence on the line and a divergence on the standpoint.

In the process of socialist construction, it is necessary to strive for high speed, which is the Party's consistent proposition. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on behalf of the CPC Central Committee: "The question of the speed of construction is the most important question facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution. Our revolution is for the most rapid development of social productive forces. Our economy was originally very backward, and there is imperialism outside our country. Only by accelerating construction as much as possible can we consolidate our socialist country and raise the living standards of the people as soon as possible. In a large country with a population of more than 600 million like ours, the rapid completion of socialist construction will greatly enhance the advantages of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is conducive to mutual assistance and cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp, to mutual assistance and cooperation among all peace forces in the world, and to the guarantee of world peace." However, right-leaning opportunists oppose this proposition. They accuse high speed of being "unstable" with ulterior motives, saying that this will create "imbalance" and "cause disproportions." In fact, there are two kinds of "stability." One is the "stability" of right-leaning opportunism, which sets the targets low, hoping to save effort, resulting in slow progress in construction, the long-term failure to establish a solid material production base for socialism, the inability to fundamentally improve people's lives, and the continued bullying by imperialism. This kind of "stability" is the greatest "instability." The other is the "stability" that we advocate, which proceeds from objective reality, fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses, goes all out, and strives for high speed, resulting in the continuous leap forward of socialist construction, the increasing consolidation of the socialist system, the faster improvement of people's lives, and the great strengthening of the socialist camp and the forces for defending world peace. If we talk about "stability," this is true "stability"!

There are also two kinds of "balance." One is the "balance" in the eyes of right-leaning opportunists, that is, seizing on the temporary and partial imbalances of certain products and exaggerating them as "disproportions in the national economy"; the other is the strategic "balance" in the entire national economy. China in the past was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and the national economy has always been unbalanced. Only by accelerating the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation can this imbalance be changed relatively quickly. Right-leaning opportunists attacked the large-scale development of steel, saying that it caused "disproportions in the national economy." This is a black-and-white reversal. Starting from changing the "poor and blank" face of our country and proceeding from the proportionate development of the entire national economy, the large-scale production of 11 million tons of steel (including 8 million tons of good steel) is not a "disproportion" at all, but precisely a further change in the unbalanced state of the national economy. Taking the situation in Beijing as an example, for a long time, Beijing has been "having iron but no steel," and even less steel products. In the movement of large-scale steelmaking last year, special steel plants, Beijing Steel Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel steelmaking workshop and several steel rolling mills were newly built and expanded at a rapid speed. This year, Beijing can produce more than 300,000 tons of steel and more than 200,000 tons of steel products. In this way, is Beijing's industry "disproportionate" or more proportionate? Of course, it is more proportionate.

To build socialism at a high speed, it is necessary to go all out, aim high, and vigorously develop mass movements. The spirit can be boosted but not dampened. To this end, we must resolutely and thoroughly refute right-leaning. Boosting energy and opposing right-leaning are two aspects of one thing. Only by sweeping away right-leaning can we truly let go and mobilize the masses, and boost the revolutionary energy of the masses even more.

Implementing the general line of socialist construction is a serious class struggle. We must not only thoroughly smash the attacks and slanders of class enemies at home and abroad; but we must also draw a clear line between ourselves and right-leaning opportunism, and thoroughly smash their rampant attacks on the general line. In this struggle, any manifestation of conciliation and wavering, no matter what their subjective wishes may be, can only benefit the bourgeoisie and be detrimental to the proletariat.

### 总路线是社会主义的生命线

　　总路线是社会主义的生命线
    党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是充分反映了社会主义经济制度的优越性的路线，是充分估计到客观可能性和六亿五千万人民主观能动作用的路线。这条马克思列宁主义的路线，一旦和群众相结合，就成为巨大的物质力量，无坚不摧，无攻不克，创造出惊天动地的奇迹来。可以毫不夸大的说，没有总路线，就没有1958年的社会主义建设的大跃进和今年前三个季度的继续跃进。因此，总路线一方面受到了全国人民的热烈拥护，人们把它看作光明的灯塔，看作六亿五千万人民决心和意志的集中表现。另一方面也受到了国内外反动派的攻击和污蔑，这些人由于听到中国人民雄壮的步伐而发抖了，他们感到重新奴役中国人民的希望日益破灭，于是就暴跳如雷，发出了恶毒的攻击。全国人民的热烈拥护，国内外敌人的恶毒攻击，这个事实的对比告诉我们，总路线究竟代表什么人的利益，违反什么人的利益，我们更可以由此辨别清楚那些人是赞成社会主义革命的，那些人是反对社会主义革命的。
    右倾机会主义分子口头上不一定反对党的总路线，而实际上是和国内外敌人心心相印，在共同地攻击和污蔑党的总路线。总路线要求社会主义建设要多快好省，力争高速度；他们则借口好省，反对多快，反对高速度，认为这也冒险，那也不稳。总路线要求鼓足干劲、力争上游，大搞群众运动；他们则松群众的劲，泄群众的气，站在群众运动之外，以资产阶级老爷式的态度，指手划脚，吹毛求疵，甚至污蔑群众运动为“小资产阶级狂热性”。因此，我们同右倾机会主义的分歧，不是个别问题上的分歧，而是路线上的分歧，立场上的分歧。
    在社会主义建设过程中，必须力争高速度，这是党的一贯的主张。刘少奇同志代表中共中央向党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中曾经指出：“建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。我国经济本来很落后，我国的外部还有帝国主义，只有尽可能地加快建设，才能尽快地巩固我们的社会主义国家，提高人民的生活水平。在我国这样一个六亿多人口的大国中，尽快地完成社会主义建设事业，又必将大大增强以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的优势，有利于社会主义阵营各国的互助合作，有利于世界上一切和平力量的互助合作，有利于世界和平的保障。”但是，右倾机会主义反对这个主张。他们别有用心地指责高速度“不稳”，说这样会造成“不平衡”，“会使比例失调”。其实“稳”有两种，一种是右倾机会主义的“稳”，指标订得低低的，希图省点儿力气，结果是建设速度迟迟不前，社会主义长期的不能建立起巩固的物质生产基础，人民生活也不能根本改善，帝国主义还是要欺侮我们。这种“稳”是最大的“不稳”。另一种是我们所主张的“稳”，从客观实际出发，充分调动广大群众的积极性，鼓足干劲，力争高速度，结果社会主义建设事业会不断跃进，社会主义制度会日益巩固，人民生活也会更快的提高，并且会大大加强社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平的力量，如果说“稳”，这才叫作真“稳”！
    “平衡”也有两种，一种是右倾机会主义分子眼里的“平衡”，即抓住某些产品的暂时的、局部的不平衡现象，夸大为“国民经济比例失调”；另一种是整个国民经济范围的战略性的“平衡”。我国过去是个半殖民地、半封建社会，国民经济从来就是不平衡的。只有加快速度发展工业、农业、交通运输事业，才能比较快地改变这种不平衡状况。右倾机会主义分子攻击大办钢铁，说大办钢铁造成了“国民经济的比例失调”。这是颠倒黑白的说法。从改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌出发，从整个国民经济的按比例发展出发，大办钢铁生产一千一百万吨钢（其中八百万吨好钢），不但不是什么“比例失调”，恰恰是进一步改变了国民经济不平衡的状况。以北京市的情况为例，长期以来，北京一直是“有铁无钢”，更无钢材。去年大办钢铁的运动中，以飞快的速度新建和扩建了特殊钢厂、北京钢厂、石钢转炉炼钢车间和几个轧钢厂。北京今年已经可以生产三十几万吨钢，二十几万吨钢材。这样一来，北京的工业是“比例失调”了呢，还是更合比例了呢？当然是更合比例了。
    高速度地建设社会主义，必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，大搞群众运动。气可鼓而不可泄。为此，必须坚决把右倾反透。鼓干劲，反右倾是一件事情的两个方面，只有横扫右倾，才能真正放手发动群众，把群众的革命干劲鼓的更足。
    贯彻社会主义建设总路线，这是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们不仅要彻底粉碎国内外阶级敌人的进攻和污蔑；而且一定要同右倾机会主义划清界线，彻底粉碎他们对总路线的猖狂进攻。在这个斗争中，任何调和和动摇的表现，不管他们主观愿望如何，都只能有利于资产阶级，而不利于无产阶级。
