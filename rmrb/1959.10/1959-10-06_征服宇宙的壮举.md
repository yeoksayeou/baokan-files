    On October 4th, just as people were celebrating the second anniversary of the Soviet Union's launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite, a colossal red rocket soared from Soviet territory once again, ascending, ascending, and ascending further in the direction of the moon. After reaching the lunar region on the 6th, it will circle the moon and return to the Earth region, becoming humanity's first automatic interplanetary station.
    Technically speaking, the automatic interplanetary station launched by the Soviet Union this time is much more complex than the rocket launched to the moon more than twenty days ago. This is because the timing and trajectory of its launch must be calculated with extreme precision, leaving no room for error. The rocket's speed is especially crucial. If the speed is slightly too high, it could bypass the moon and become an artificial planet; if it is slightly too low, it might not reach the lunar region and be held by the Earth's gravity, becoming an Earth satellite or being pulled back to the ground. Therefore, it must fully meet the predetermined requirements in order to be "caught" by the moon's gravity upon reaching the lunar region, and after flying around the mysterious far side of the moon, it must return to the Earth region. This requires extremely precise calculations and control with no room for error. It is no wonder that French scientist Alexandre Ananoff said that putting a rocket into lunar orbit is a hundred times more difficult than reaching the moon.
    The scientific exploration tasks undertaken by this rocket are of utmost importance because it will directly photograph the back of the moon and transmit the images back to Earth. This is also an unprecedented feat. As people know, because the moon's rotation speed is the same as its orbital speed around the Earth, it always faces the Earth with the same side. Since ancient times, no one has been able to see what the "back" of the moon (accounting for 41% of the moon's surface area) actually looks like. Now, this rocket will answer the riddle that people have never been able to solve.
    Since the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, it has successfully launched three artificial Earth satellites and three space rockets in a short span of two years. In between, it has also launched multiple geophysical high-altitude rockets to conduct high-altitude biological experiments. Soviet scientists are boldly challenging the universe, and now, the magnificent feat of conquering the universe is within reach.
    The three artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union are heavier than each other, farther from the Earth than each other, carry more scientific instruments than each other, and have greater scientific value than each other!
    In January of this year, Soviet scientists created the second cosmic velocity (11.2 kilometers per second) for the first time in human history, throwing the last-stage space rocket, weighing 1,472 kilograms, into an orbit around the sun, becoming the tenth planet in the solar system. The leap from the first cosmic velocity (8 kilometers per second) to the second cosmic velocity is a significant one, and the object sent into orbit is also more than 140 kilograms heavier than the third satellite. It is no wonder that Western scientists were astonished and exclaimed, "This is an incredible big guy!" The last stage of the second Soviet space rocket that broke into the lunar palace on September 14 was 39 kilograms heavier than the first space rocket; and the weight of the last stage of the third space rocket launched this time is 42 kilograms heavier than the last stage of the second space rocket. According to scientific calculations, at least a four-stage rocket is required to create the second cosmic velocity, and for every kilogram of weight added to the last stage of the four-stage rocket, the entire rocket must increase by 10,000 kilograms, and the rocket's thrust must of course be increased accordingly. Therefore, even adding a few centimeters of weight to the last stage of the space rocket is not a simple matter. Therefore, Vassie, the head of the French rocket research institution, said, "Technically speaking, the new rocket is an extraordinary achievement, especially given its weight."
    About four months after the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial Earth satellite, the United States finally launched a small satellite weighing only a little over five kilograms. From then until now, after many failures, several satellites have been launched successively, and a space rocket has barely been launched. But they are all very light, and even flying around the Earth, people cannot see them. To compensate for this defect, the United States fantastically wanted to send a so-called "balloon satellite" made of plastic-coated aluminum, carrying no scientific instruments, into orbit in August this year, and insisted on creating a "visible" artificial satellite. But, pitifully, even this was not successful. Shortly after it ascended, the rocket carrying it malfunctioned, and it perished with the rocket in the atmosphere! Recently, in order to urgently save face, the United States prepared to launch a lunar satellite orbiting the moon with an "Atlas" rocket in early October, when the moon was closest to the Earth. However, when a static test was conducted on the launch pad on September 24, it immediately exploded into pieces.
    When the Soviet Union successfully launched the space rocket that reached the moon, American rocket expert Wernher von Braun said that if the Soviet Union stopped developing for five years, the United States would be able to catch up with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet socialist system can guarantee that it will not only not "stop," but its development speed will also become faster and faster. The continuous launch of two space rockets in less than a month is proof of this.
    The east wind prevails over the west wind. The old ox cart of capitalism, already facing death, can only look on as the vigorous socialist steed surpasses it and leaves it in the dust.

    征服宇宙的壮举
    新华社记者述评
    10月4日，正当人们庆祝苏联发射世界上第一个人造地球卫星上天两周年的时候，一支巨大无匹的红色火箭，又在苏联的国土上腾空而起，向着月球的方向上升，上升，再上升。它在6日到达月球区后，将绕过月球重新回到地球区来，成为人类史上第一个自动行星际站。
    苏联这次发射的自动行星际站，在技术上说，要比二十多天前发射到达月球的火箭复杂得多。因为它发射的时间、轨道要计算得非常精确，不能有一点差错。尤其是火箭的速度更为重要。速度如果稍大一点，就可能越过月球，而成为人造行星；稍小一点，又可能到达不了月球区而被地球的引吸力拉住而成为地球卫星或被拉回地面。因此，它必须完全合乎预定的要求，才可能在到达月球区的时候，被月球的引力所“抓住”，而在绕月球神秘的背面飞行以后，还要重新飞回地球区来。这需要一种间不容发的极端精密的计算和控制。无怪法国科学家安纳诺夫说，使火箭进入绕月球的轨道，要比到达月球困难一百倍。
    这个火箭所负担的科学考察任务具有极重要的意义，因为它将把月宫背面的情况直接拍摄下来，再传送回地球。这也是旷古未有的伟迹。人们知道，由于月球的自转速度和绕地球公转速度相同，因此，它总是从同一个圆面面对着地球。自古以来，谁都无法看到，月球的“背面”（占月球面积的41％）究竟有些什么。现在，这个火箭即将回答人们从来未能解决的谜。
    苏联自从1957年10月4日发射了第一个人造地球卫星以来，在短短的两年时间内，已经成功地发射了三个人造地球卫星和三个宇宙火箭，其间还发射了多次地球物理高空火箭，进行高空生物试验。苏联科学家正昂首阔步地向宇宙挑战，现在，征服宇宙的壮伟业迹，已经指日可待了。
    苏联发射的三个人造卫星一个比一个重，离地球的距离也一个比一个远，携带的科学仪器一个比一个多，科学价值也一个比一个大！
    今年1月，苏联科学家在人类历史上第一次创造了第二宇宙速度（每秒十一点二公里），把重达一千四百七十二公斤的最后一级宇宙火箭抛进了围绕太阳运行的轨道，成为太阳系中第十个行星。从第一宇宙速度（每秒八公里）到第二宇宙速度是一个飞跃，而且送进轨道的物体又比第三个卫星还要重一百四十多公斤。无怪乎西方科学家吃惊得瞠目结舌，大呼“这是一个了不得的大家伙”。9月14日闯进月宫的苏联第二个宇宙火箭的最后一级，又比第一个宇宙火箭重三十九公斤；而这一次发射的第三个宇宙火箭最后一级的重量又比第二个宇宙火箭最后一级重四十二公斤。根据科学计算，要创造第二宇宙速度，最少要用四级火箭，而在四级火箭的最后一级增加一公斤的重量，整个火箭就要增加一万公斤，火箭的推力当然也要相应地增加。因此，即使要在宇宙火箭的最后一级增加几公分的重量，也不是简单的事情。因此，法国火箭研究机构负责人瓦西说，“在技术上说，新火箭是非凡的成就，特别是鉴于它有这样的重量。”
    美国在苏联发射成功第一个人造地球卫星以后四个月左右，总算也发射了一个只有五公斤多一点的小卫星。从那时起到现在，经过多次失败，陆续地发射了几个卫星，勉强发射过一个宇宙火箭。但它们的重量都很小，就是绕地球飞人家也看不到它。为了弥补这个缺陷，美国异想天开地在今年8月想把一个不携带任何科学仪器的塑料镀铝的所谓“气球卫星”送入轨道，硬要制造一个“看得见”的人造卫星。但是，说来可怜，连这一点也没有成功。它上升不久，运载它的火箭就发生故障，它就在大气层中和火箭同归于尽了！最近，美国为了迫切地想挽回一点面子，准备在10月初，当月球最靠近地球的时候，用“阿特拉斯”火箭发射一个围绕月球转的月球卫星。但是，当9月24日在发射场上进行静止试验时，立刻就炸了个粉碎。
    美国火箭专家布劳恩当苏联发射成功到达月球的宇宙火箭时，曾经说，如果苏联停止发展五年，美国就能够赶上苏联。但是，苏联的社会主义制度可以保证它非但不会“停下来”，而且发展的速度还将愈来愈快。这次在不到一个月的时间内就连续发射了两个宇宙火箭就是明证。
    东风劲吹西风衰。已经面临死亡的资本主义的老牛破车，只能空望着充满生命力的社会主义的骏马超过它绝尘而去。
