Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch: The first phase of the Hainan Island circular railway, the An-Huang section, spanning 108 kilometers, officially opened to traffic on National Day.

The An-Huang section of the circular railway, including the 29-kilometer Huangliu to Yinggehai branch line, totals 137 kilometers in length. Currently, the section from Anyou Wharf in Yaxian County to Huangliu in Ledong County, spanning 108 kilometers, is officially open to traffic. When Japanese imperialism occupied Hainan Island, in 1943, to plunder Hainan Island's abundant resources, they built a narrow-gauge railway on this route. However, due to crude and simple construction, this railway was abandoned after being damaged by a typhoon in 1946. After liberation, with the rapid development of Hainan Island's construction endeavors, the transportation department decided to build a circular railway on Hainan Island, and the construction of the An-Huang line became the first phase of the project. Since the full-scale construction of this section began in September of last year, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the laborers who were responsible for the construction task have overcome various difficulties. In order to dedicate the early opening of the An-Huang line to National Day, they adopted the method of rushing to transport sleepers down the mountain on sunny days and transporting them below the mountain on rainy days, overcoming the difficulties of transportation during the rainy season and completing the track-laying task ahead of schedule. At the same time, they also adopted the construction method of focusing on key points and spreading out comprehensively, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project.

The end of the An-Huang line is Yinggehai, one of the largest salt fields in the country, and the northeast corner is Jianfengling, one of the eight major forest areas in the country. There are also fishing ports such as Gangmen, Jiaotou, and Wanglou along the line. The opening of this railway not only guarantees the transportation needs of these areas but will also greatly promote the development of agricultural production along the line and will play a huge role in promoting the construction of Hainan Island.

　　海南岛修建环岛铁路
    首期工程安黄段正式通车
    新华社广州电　海南岛环岛铁路第一期工程、长达一百零八公里的安黄段，在国庆节当天正式通车。
    环岛铁路安黄段，全线包括黄流至莺歌海的二十九公里支线，共长一百三十七公里。目前，建成正式通车的是从崖县的安游码头至乐东县的黄流线，长一百零八公里。日本帝国主义占领海南岛时，为掠夺海南岛的丰富资源，1943年曾在这条线路上建成了一条窄轨铁路。但是由于工程粗糙简陋，1946年遭受台风破坏后，这条铁路便被废弃。解放后，随着海南岛的建设事业迅速发展，交通运输部门决定在海南岛建设一条环岛铁路时，修建安黄线便成为第一期工程。这段线路从去年9月进入全面施工以来，担负修建任务的中国人民解放军铁道兵某部和民工们曾经克服了种种困难。为了使安黄线提前通车向国庆献礼，他们采取了晴天抢运枕木下山，雨天在山下运输的办法，战胜了雨季运输的困难，使铺轨任务提前完成。同时，还采用了重点突击、全面铺开的施工方法，使工程进度大大加快。
    安黄线的末端是全国最大盐场之一的莺歌海，东北角是全国八大林区之一的尖峰岭。沿线附近还有港门、角头、望楼等渔港。这条铁路的通车，不但保证了这些地区的运输需要，同时还将大大地促进沿线农业生产的发展，对海南岛的建设将起巨大的推动作用。
