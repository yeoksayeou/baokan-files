This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch on the 13th: Kaijiang County, Sichuan Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of mid-season rice, leaping to become a thousand-jin county. The county's more than 233,000 mu of mid-season rice was basically harvested by early September. After level-by-level inspection, weighing, and repeated verification, the total output reached over 235,594,800 jin, an increase of 1.28 times compared to last year, with an average yield of 1,012 jin per mu, an increase of 26.5% compared to last year.

Kaijiang County is located in the hilly area of the Daba Mountains in northern Sichuan, with a mild climate and fertile soil. Before liberation, the yield of mid-season rice was only about 350 jin per mu. After liberation, with the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, production gradually increased. After communization, the broad masses, relying on the greater collective strength of the commune, launched a vigorous upsurge in water conservancy construction. In one winter, they started construction on seven large reservoirs capable of both irrigation and flood control, completed 1,023 mountain bay ponds and flat ponds, and more than 2,000 water storage pools and canals. Adding in the projects that were not yet completed but had already demonstrated benefits, the irrigated area was expanded by more than 40,000 mu. Thus, the irrigated area of rice paddies in the county expanded from 50% to more than 70%, laying a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest. This year, during the flowering and heading period of mid-season rice, there was no heavy rain in the county for nearly seventy days. However, half of the rice paddies were not affected by the drought and achieved a good harvest.

In this year's struggle to combat drought and ensure harvest, the communes throughout the county also made use of the characteristics of the hilly area, building river-blocking weirs to intercept river water for irrigating rice paddies. The communes concentrated their forces to implement large-scale operations and large-scale cooperation, which quickly developed this movement. A total of more than 800 larger river-blocking weirs and a large number of small river-blocking weirs were built, intercepting water at more than 5,000 locations, forming a dense self-flowing irrigation network, which irrigated most of the more than 120,000 mu of drought-stricken rice paddies, overcoming the drought and achieving a bumper harvest.

The bumper harvest of mid-season rice in Kaijiang County is also due to the county's reliance on the strength of the people's commune to thoroughly, meticulously, and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. This year, the land for planting mid-season rice in the county was generally deepened from six or seven cun in the past to eight or nine cun, plowed and harrowed three to four times, with sufficient base fertilizer, applying more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. More than 80% of the rice paddies were planted with improved varieties, and rational close planting was vigorously promoted. From planting to harvesting, the technical specifications and quality of various agricultural tasks have been greatly improved compared to previous years. In rice paddy management, the communes throughout the county carried out timely cultivation and topdressing, eliminated third-class seedlings, and also established pesticide factories to produce large quantities of pesticides to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.

Timely early sowing and early transplanting is another important reason for this year's increased production. This year, due to the fact that the area of ​​spring crops in the county was larger than in previous years, the area of ​​mid-season rice increased by nearly doubled compared to last year, the degree of close planting was high, and the quality requirements were strict. When seizing the time to harvest and transplant, the labor force was very tight. The communes throughout the county rationally arranged the labor force, especially by establishing public canteens to liberate tens of thousands of women's labor force, greatly increasing the attendance rate. At the same time, under the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, human and animal power were mutually supported between communities and teams, and seedlings, tools and other materials were mutually adjusted, and various difficulties were solved. The entire county completed the transplanting of mid-season rice half a month earlier than last year.

The unprecedented bumper harvest of mid-season rice has further strengthened the confidence of the people throughout the county in striving for greater production increases this year and a great leap forward next year. Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people throughout the county immediately launched a vigorous new production upsurge. The communes are striving for an additional 50 to 100 jin of raw grain per mu for the 200,000 mu of late autumn crops. At the same time, they are stepping up autumn plowing and autumn planting and vigorously engaging in smoked soil fertilizer production, striving for a greater bumper harvest of wheat next year.

### 开江跃为中稻千斤县  同去年比：总产量增一倍多，亩产量增长26.5％

　　开江跃为中稻千斤县
    同去年比：总产量增一倍多，亩产量增长26.5％
    本报成都13日电　四川省开江县中稻空前大丰收，一跃为中稻千斤县。全县二十三万三千多亩中稻在9月初已基本收完，经过层层验收过秤和反复核实，总产量二亿三千五百九十四万八千多斤，比去年增加一点二八倍，平均亩产达一千零一十二斤，比去年增加26.5％。
    开江县位于四川北部大巴山丘陵地区，气候温和，土壤肥沃。解放前中稻亩产只有三百五十斤左右。解放后，随着农业合作化运动的发展，生产逐步上升。公社化后，广大群众依靠公社更大的集体力量，掀起了轰轰烈烈的水利建设高潮，一个冬天开工修建七座能灌溉又能防洪的大水库，完成一千零二十三个山湾塘和平塘以及两千多个蓄水池和渠堰，加上尚未完工但已发挥了效益的工程，共扩大灌溉面积四万多亩。这样，全县稻田灌溉面积从50％扩大到70％以上，为今年大丰收打下了良好的基础。今年，中稻扬花抽穗时期全县近七十天没下大雨，但是，一半稻田没有因旱情影响丰收。
    在今年抗旱保收斗争中，全县各公社还利用丘陵区的特点，大修拦河堰，拦截河水灌溉稻田。各公社集中兵力实行大兵团作战和大协作，使这一运动迅速开展起来。全县共修成八百多个较大的拦河堰和大量小拦河堰，截流五千多处，形成了一个渠流密布的自流灌溉网，使受旱的十二万多亩稻田绝大部分得到灌溉，战胜干旱，获得丰收。
    开江县中稻大丰收，还由于全县依靠人民公社的力量，深入、细致、全面地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。今年，全县种植中稻的土地一般都由过去深耕六、七寸提高到八、九寸，犁耙三到四次，底肥足，每亩施肥两万斤以上，有80％以上的稻田种植了良种，大力推行了合理密植。从种到收，各种农活的技术规格和质量都比往年大大提高。在稻田管理上，全县各公社及时中耕追肥，消灭了三类苗，并且大办农药厂，生产大量农药，防治了病虫害。
    适时早播早栽是今年增产的另一个重要原因。今年这个县由于小春作物面积比往年大，中稻面积又比去年增加将近一倍，密植程度高，质量要求严，在抢收抢栽的时候劳力非常紧张。全县各公社合理安排了劳力，特别是办了公共食堂解放了几万个妇女劳动力，出工率大大提高。同时在等价互利的原则下，社队之间，人力、畜力互相支援，秧苗、工具和其他物资相互调剂，各种困难都迎刃而解。全县中稻比去年提早半个月栽完。
    中稻获得空前大丰收更加坚定了全县人民力争今年更大增产和明年大跃进的信心。在党的八届八中全会的号召下，全县人民紧接着掀起轰轰烈烈的新的生产高潮。各公社力争二十万亩晚秋作物每亩多打五十斤到一百斤原粮；同时加紧秋耕秋种和大搞熏土造肥，力争明年小麦更大丰收。
