Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 1st. Today, the ancient city of Lhasa was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums and thunderous cheers. More than 35,000 people of all ethnic groups held an unprecedentedly grand celebration rally and parade, cheering the brilliant achievements of the motherland's multi-ethnic family over the past ten years since the founding of the nation, and celebrating their new life after being liberated from the cruel serf system.

    On the square in front of the Potala Palace, countless red flags fluttered in the clear sky of the plateau. The meeting place and the streets around the meeting place were crowded with Tibetan men and women in festive costumes, holding flowers and colored flags.

    On the presidium of the meeting were responsible persons of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, officers of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, representatives of workers, peasants and citizens, and representatives of the three major monasteries of Lhasa: Drepung, Sera, and Ganden.

    The Consul General of the Republic of India in Lhasa, Mr. K. L. Bhargava, the Consul General of the Kingdom of Nepal in Lhasa, Mr. Basnyat, and personnel from the Indian and Nepalese consulates were also invited to attend the ceremony.

    At 9:30 a.m., the meeting began with the national anthem, and two young Tibetan men and women raised the national flag into the clear sky.

    Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, and Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Commander of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, spoke at the meeting successively. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, our country has achieved great and brilliant achievements in the ten years since its founding, and the unity of all ethnic groups in our country is unprecedented. In his speech, Zhang Jingwu called on the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and strive to completely eliminate the feudal serf system and victoriously complete the glorious task of democratic reform. Tenzin Gyatso, a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Kunwang Yixi, a representative of workers in Lhasa who used to be a slave for the nobles, also spoke. They cheered the achievements made by the motherland in the past ten years and after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and expressed their firm determination to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet. The meeting finally passed a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao in thunderous applause and slogans.

    At 11:00 a.m., more than 35,000 people of all ethnic groups who participated in the celebration rally began a grand parade from the People's Square in front of the Potala Palace. Behind a sea of colored flags, a group of 500 Young Pioneers walked to the front of the rostrum. They waved brightly colored bouquets at the huge portrait of Chairman Mao on the rostrum, and hundreds of colored balloons rose into the sky from their ranks. When balloons with the slogan "Long Live Chairman Mao" floated into the sky, the children applauded and cheered enthusiastically. A few months ago, some of these children were still wandering the streets, and some were still slaves. Today, they have bid farewell forever to the tragic fate suffered by their fathers and brothers for generations.

    The troops of the People's Liberation Army marched forward majestically to the sound of magnificent military music. People of all ethnic groups standing on both sides of the street applauded and cheered their protectors enthusiastically. A group of children and girls ran out of the crowd and threw bouquets and confetti at the soldiers, thanking the heroic People's Liberation Army for quickly quelling the rebellion launched by upper-class reactionaries and opening up a new life for them.

    Many floats displaying huge architectural models came over, followed by a mighty contingent, the first group of Tibetan workers who grew up with the victory of the suppression of the rebellion. More than 2,600 Tibetan workers who are rushing to build Tibet's first hydropower station on the Lhasa River came from the construction site more than ten kilometers away to participate in the parade, beating drums and playing flutes.

    Farmers from dozens of manors on the outskirts of the city set out in groups before dawn today. Some carried bundles of golden highland barley and wheat ears, some carried large cabbages, and some carried dozens of kilograms of large radishes to participate in the parade. These crops were the first harvest they had after their emancipation on the land where the policy of "whoever sows, reaps" was implemented. Peasants from the eastern suburbs carried a "good news sign" depicting their new life after the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee, anti-slavery and rent reduction and interest reduction): more than 1,800 farmers divided and cultivated more than 18,000 mu of land, and more than 2.3 million jin of grain belonged to them for the first time. The more than 2.2 million grams (each gram being 25 or 26 jin) of grain and more than 240,000 *cheng* (one *cheng* was equivalent to three yuan and three jiao in silver dollars at that time) of usurious loans that the farmers had been unable to repay for generations had been completely abolished. When the farmers passed the rostrum, they held up the pure white *hada* in their hands to pay tribute to the national flag flying in the sky. They said excitedly: "Without the great motherland, there would be no new life today!"

    A parade of more than 20,000 citizens and lamas marched forward singing and dancing. In this contingent, there were old people who had been wandering and begging not long ago, and children who had just started school. Some held flowers, some held *hada*, some played the six-stringed lute, and some beat the big yak skin drum, singing newly composed songs and dancing the "Happy Tap Dance." Folk artists and Tibetan opera troupes, who were regarded as "inferior people" a month ago, are now full of energy and happily performing various beautiful dances such as the "Yak Dance" and the "Peacock Dance".

    欢呼祖国成就　庆贺西藏新生
    拉萨三万多人集会庆祝建国十周年
    新华社拉萨1日电　拉萨古城今天锣鼓喧天，欢声雷动，三万五千多名各族人民举行了空前盛大的庆祝大会和游行，欢呼建国十年来祖国各民族大家庭的光辉成就，欢呼他们已经从残酷的农奴制度下获得了新生。
    布达拉宫前的广场上，无数面红旗在高原的晴空中飘扬，会场上和会场四周的街道上，挤满了穿着节日盛装、拿着鲜花彩旗的藏族男女。
    在大会主席台上有中共西藏工委负责人、西藏自治区筹备委员会委员、人民解放军西藏军区军官，工人、农民和市民的代表以及拉萨哲蚌、色拉、噶丹三大寺的代表等。
    印度共和国驻拉萨总领事高尔、尼泊尔王国驻拉萨总领事巴斯尼亚特以及印度和尼泊尔领事馆人员也应邀来观礼。
    上午九时半，大会在国歌声中开始，两名藏族青年男女把国旗升上碧空。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武和中共西藏工委副书记、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员、人民解放军西藏军区司令员张国华先后在大会上讲话。他们在讲话中，一致指出我国建国十年来在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府正确领导下，取得了伟大光辉的成就，我国各族人民空前大团结。张经武在讲话中号召西藏各族人民同心同德，团结一致，为彻底消灭封建农奴制度、胜利完成民主改革的光荣任务而奋斗。西藏自治区筹备委员会委员丹增嘉措、过去给贵族当过奴隶的拉萨市工人代表昆旺益西也讲了话。他们欢呼祖国十年来和西和藏平解放后所取得的成绩，表示了建设民主和社会主义新西藏的坚强决心。大会最后在雷动的掌声和口号声中，通过了给党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的致敬电。
    上午十一时，参加庆祝大会的三万五千多各族人民，从布达拉宫前的人民广场上开始了盛大的游行。在一片如云的彩旗后面，五百名少先队员的队伍走到了主席台前。他们向主席台上毛主席的巨幅画像挥舞着鲜艳的花束，几百个彩色的气球从他们的队伍中升上天空。当悬挂着“毛主席万岁”标语的气球飞向天空的时候，孩子们热烈地鼓掌欢呼。几个月前，这些孩子有的还流落街头，有的还是奴隶。今天，他们和自己父兄世代遭受的悲惨命运，已永远告别。
    人民解放军的部队在雄壮的军乐声中威武地向前行进。站立在街道两旁的各族人民向他们的保卫者热烈鼓掌欢呼。一群孩子和姑娘从人群里跑出来，把花束和五彩纸屑抛向战士，感谢英勇的人民解放军迅速平息了上层反动分子发动的叛乱，为他们开辟了新生。
    许多辆陈列着巨大建筑模型的彩车过来了，它们的后面行进着一支浩浩荡荡的队伍，这是随着平叛的胜利而成长起来的西藏第一批藏族工人。两千六百多名正在拉萨河上赶修西藏第一座水电站的藏族工人们，今天敲着大鼓，吹着长笛，从十几公里以外的工地赶来参加游行。
    城市四郊几十个庄园里的农民，今天天不亮就成群结队地出发了。他们有的拿着一束束金黄的青稞和小麦穗，有的背着肥大的白菜，有的抱着几十斤重的大萝卜参加了游行。这些农作物是他们翻身后在实行“谁种谁收”政策的土地上第一次收获到的。东郊区农民抬着一幅“报喜牌”，上面描绘着他们在“三反双减”（反叛乱、反乌拉差役、反奴役和减租减息）以后的新生活：一千八百多户农民分种了一万八千多亩土地，二百三十多万斤粮食第一次归他们自己所有。他们世世代代无法还清的二百二十多万克（每克二十五、六斤）粮食和二十四万多秤（当时一秤相当银元三元三角）藏银的高利贷，已被全部废除。农民们经过主席台时，高举手中洁白的“哈达”，向在高空飘扬的国旗致敬，他们激动地说：“没有伟大的祖国就不会有今天的新生活！”
    由两万多名市民和喇嘛组成的游行队伍，载歌载舞地前进。在这支队伍中，有不久前还流浪乞讨的老人，有刚入学读书的儿童。他们有的拿着鲜花，有的捧着“哈达”，有的弹着六弦琴，有的敲着大牛皮鼓，唱着新编的歌曲，跳着“幸福踢踏舞”。一个月前被看作是“下贱人”的民间艺人和藏戏团体，今天精神抖擞，愉快地演着“牦牛舞”、“孔雀舞”等各种优美的舞蹈。
