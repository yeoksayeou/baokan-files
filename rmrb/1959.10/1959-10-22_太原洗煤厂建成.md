Construction News from All Sides:

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st. The newly built Taiyuan Coal Washing Plant officially went into production on the 20th. This large-scale, modern coal washing plant can produce 2 million to 3 million tons of refined coal annually. This refined coal will mainly be supplied to the Baotou Iron and Steel Company and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. The plant can also extract industrial coal dust from the coal washing water.
    The construction project of this plant was arduous and complex. During the construction process, the workers promoted the advanced experience of "three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation," completing the original planned workload of 105 days in 45 days. In order to put it into production early, the workers created the method of "ground assembly and overall installation," which enabled the huge and complex equipment to be installed quickly and well. More than 40 fraternal factories and mines across the country supported the construction of this plant.
    The Taiyuan Coal Washing Plant was built with the assistance of the Polish People's Republic.

    太原洗煤厂建成
    据新华社太原21日电　新建的太原洗煤厂20日正式投入生产。这座大型的现代化洗煤厂，每年能生产精煤二百万到三百万吨，这些精煤将主要供包头钢铁公司和太原钢铁公司用。这个厂还能从洗煤水里提取工业用煤粉。
    这个厂的建设工程艰巨而又复杂。在施工过程中，职工们推行了“立体交叉平行流水作业”的先进经验，用四十五天完成了原计划一百零五天的工作量。为了提早投入生产，工人们创造了“地面组立、整体安装”的办法，使庞大而复杂的设备又快又好地安装起来。全国有四十多个兄弟厂矿支援了这个厂的建设。
    太原洗煤厂是波兰人民共和国帮助建设的。
