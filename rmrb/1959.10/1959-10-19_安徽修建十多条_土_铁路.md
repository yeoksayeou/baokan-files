	Anhui Builds Over Ten "Indigenous" Railways
	The eight completed lines prove: low investment, low cost, large capacity, rapid construction; the transportation cost of each ton of coal is only a quarter of that of trucks.
	
	(Our reporter Yu Feng reports) Anhui Province is vigorously building "indigenous" railways to save labor on the transportation front and better solve the problem of short-distance transportation of important materials such as coal and iron.
	Anhui Province plans to build seventeen "indigenous" railways this year, including both standard gauge and narrow gauge, with a total length of 128.14 kilometers. Eight have been completed and opened to traffic, six are under construction, and the rest will be started after surveying and design. These railways connect some iron mines, coal mines, and bamboo and wood production areas with waterways, railways, and other transportation trunk lines.
	The "indigenous" railways that have been completed and opened to traffic have already played a significant role. For example, the five "indigenous" railways in the Huainan Coal Mine enable the timely outward transportation of coal produced by some newly built small coal mines in the mining area. In May, the Huainan Coal Mine built an "indigenous" railway between small and large coal mines, completely replacing flatbed transportation, and can transport 1,000 tons of coal per day, which can fully meet the transportation needs of three small coal mines. Bengbu City built a 1.1-kilometer-long "indigenous" railway between the Huaihe River wharf and the railway freight station, which can transport 2,000 tons of grain and pig iron per day, equivalent to a quarter of the city's flatbed transportation capacity. The partially opened Jingxian County "indigenous" railway, with a total length of 16.3 kilometers, can not only replace trucks and flatbeds to directly transport coke and coal from the Jingxian County Coal Mine to the Jingxian County Steel Plant, but also transport coal to the Qingyi River bank, and then transport it to Wuhu by waterway. After the "indigenous" railway from Shexian County to Jixi County in the mountainous area of southern Anhui is completed, the bamboo and wood and many local specialties produced in Shexian County will be transported to the Shuiyang River in Jixi County via this road, and then transported to Wuhu for distribution by waterway. The two "indigenous" railways under construction in the Feidong County Dolomite Mining Area and the Chaoxian County Guishan Quarry in the Jianghuai area will be connected to the Huainan Railway, and mineral raw materials can be directly transported to Hefei, Bengbu and other places via "indigenous" and foreign railways.
	The key issues in building "indigenous" railways well are: can the quality of the rails be guaranteed? Can locomotives and vehicles be manufactured in large quantities? How to solve the organizational leadership and technical leadership problems of building "indigenous" railways? Anhui Province has gained some experience in these aspects.
	What about the quality of "indigenous" rails?
	If railways are not laid with steel rails but with iron rails cast from iron produced by small blast furnaces in the province, are they easy to break? Is the rail shape straight?
	With the help of the Railway Science Institute, the Jiulonggang Rail Casting Factory of the Bengbu Railway Bureau has successfully trial-produced three types of rails (each 4.1 meters long). One is a "⊥" shaped rail cast from gray iron, weighing 27 kilograms per meter; one is an "I" shaped high-grade cast iron rail cast from 85% gray iron and 15% white iron, weighing 48 kilograms per meter; and one is an "I" shaped rail made of ductile cast iron, weighing 48 kilograms per meter. According to the static pressure test results, the 27-kilogram rail can withstand 8 to 9 tons of pressure. Operational tests on the "indigenous" railways in Huainan and Bengbu have proven that the rails rarely break. The 48-kilogram high-grade cast iron rail can withstand 25 to 35 tons of pressure, and the ductile cast iron rail can withstand 35 to 53 tons of pressure. When the latter two types of rails are run by the ㄇㄎ1 locomotive at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour and the ㄇㄎ7 locomotive at a speed of 35 kilometers per hour, the rails are in good condition and undamaged. At present, light rails and high-grade cast iron rails have been mass-produced by the Jiulonggang Rail Casting Factory, the Bengbu Rail Casting Factory, and factories in Wuhu and other places.
	Rail spikes and fishplates are also manufactured with substitutes, saving a lot of steel. The spikes are forged from charcoal-fired steel, a local steel produced in the Dabie Mountains last year, and the fishplates are made of high-grade cast iron after heat treatment, with good quality.
	How to solve the problem of locomotives and vehicles?
	What is used as the locomotive for "indigenous" railways? The staff of the Jiulonggang Locomotive Depot have tried to make it with a gas engine, a 10-horsepower diesel engine, and also modified it from a car. They searched through various types of trucks in Huainan and found two types of trucks with front and rear axle lengths that were not much different from the railway gauge. They calculated and studied for more than a month, and solved the problem that the truck axle was narrower than the railway gauge by widening the tread surface of the truck iron wheels, and also modified the axle part of the truck, replaced the rubber wheels with pig iron wheels, and added a gearbox and a sand-spreading device to convert the truck into an "indigenous" locomotive. The average towing capacity of this locomotive is 100 tons, which is equivalent to ten times that of an ordinary truck, after being tested on the 100-kilometer line from Huainan to Hefei. Its characteristics are low cost, easy to modify, and can be restored when not needed; at the same time, it uses less oil, and the gasoline consumed per ten kilometers is equal to a quarter of the gasoline consumed by a car driving the same distance on the road. Now, five units have been modified in the province, and they are still being modified one after another.
	Workers in Bengbu City's machinery factory, shipyard, and repair factory are modifying locomotives with diesel engines, with a designed capacity of 300 horsepower, capable of towing more than 500 tons. There are also electric locomotives running on the Huainan "indigenous" railway.
	The "indigenous" railway vehicles designed and manufactured by the staff of the Jiulonggang Vehicle Depot are the same style as those of foreign railways, with three types of loads: five tons, six tons, and nine tons (weighing 1.5 tons, 2 tons, and 4.6 tons respectively). The running part of this vehicle is relatively simple. Except for the axle, which is made of round steel, the rest is made of wood and pig iron. If there are no springs, they use discarded springs from foreign vehicles; if there is no hydraulic press to press the wheels onto the axles, they ask the Shanghai Railway Bureau for help with processing. At present, more than 60 such vehicles have been manufactured in the province, most of which are five-ton freight cars.
	Who leads the road construction work?
	Which department is best responsible for the organizational leadership and technical leadership of building "indigenous" railways? Anhui Province's experience is that the railway bureau is the best. The reasons are: the railway bureau has rich experience, which can make the work of repairing "indigenous" railways less detours and can guarantee quality; the railway bureau's material and technical strength is relatively strong, and the contact surface is wide, which can solve various difficult problems more smoothly.
	Anhui Province's experience proves that compared with foreign railways, "indigenous" railways have the advantages of low investment, low cost, fast construction, easy local solution of materials and equipment, and construction can be carried out wherever needed; compared with cars and flatbeds, they have the advantages of large capacity, saving labor, low transportation costs, and being unimpeded by wind and rain.
	Anhui Province's "indigenous" railways have developed under the strong leadership of party committees at all levels. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the work of building "indigenous" railways. At the beginning of the year, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the policy of repairing "indigenous" railways: "Easy first, then difficult, short first, then long, first repair factories and mines and material concentration areas mainly based on coal and iron mines," and held on-site meetings to break the superstitious idea of "not being able to run railways by themselves," and comprehensively arranged this year's line, materials, and manufacturing work for repairing "indigenous" railways based on the province's steel production capacity and various needs. One vice governor in the province and the heads of transportation in each prefecture and city are specifically leading this work. During the construction process, the railway bureau is responsible for organizational leadership and technical leadership, and each place is responsible for building roadbeds, bridges, and culverts under the guidance of the railway bureau, based on the principle of self-raising and self-construction; the railway bureau is responsible for designing and trial-producing rails, locomotives, and vehicles, and jointly manufacturing with local governments. In addition to the two major tasks of railway transportation and infrastructure construction under its responsibility, the Bengbu Railway Bureau has listed the repair of "indigenous" railways as the third major task of the entire bureau, and has specially established a "Local Railway Guidance Office" to be responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance guidance of "indigenous" railways. All sections and projects, personnel, materials and other departments of the whole bureau actively participated in the construction of "indigenous" railways.

　　壮大短途运输力量　沟通工厂矿山
　　安徽修建十多条“土”铁路
　　已经通车的八条线路证明：投资少、成本低、运量大、建设快；每吨煤炭的运输成本只及汽车的四分之一
    本报讯　记者于风报道：安徽省为了节省运输战线上的劳动力，更好地解决煤、铁等重要物资的短途运输问题，正在大建“土”铁路。
    安徽省今年计划兴建的“土”铁路有十七条，分标准轨和窄轨两种，共长一百二十八点一四公里。已通车的有八条，正在兴建的有六条，其余待勘查设计后即动工兴建。这些铁路把一些铁矿、煤矿、竹木产地同水道、铁路等交通干线衔接起来。
    建成通车的“土”铁路，已经发挥了很大作用。如淮南煤矿的五条“土”铁路，使这个矿区新建的一些小煤井生产的煤能够及时外运。5月间，淮南煤矿在小煤井和大矿井之间修了一条“土”铁路，全部代替了板车运输，每天能运煤一千吨，完全能适应三个小煤井的运输需要。蚌埠市在淮河码头到铁路货运车站之间修了一条一点一公里长的“土”铁路，每天可以运粮食、生铁二千吨，相当于全市四分之一的板车运输能力。部分通车的泾县“土”铁路，全长十六点三公里，除代替汽车、板车把泾县煤矿的焦、煤直接送到泾县钢铁厂以外，还可以把煤运至青弋江边，再经水路运至芜湖。皖南山区歙县到绩溪的“土”铁路修好以后，歙县盛产的竹木和许多土特产将经过这条路运到绩溪县内的水阳江边，经水运到芜湖集散。江淮地区正在兴建的肥东县白云石矿区、巢县龟山采石场的两条“土”铁路将和淮南路接轨，矿石原料可经“土”、洋铁路直达合肥、蚌埠等地。
    修好“土”铁路的关键问题是：铁轨能否保证质量？机车、车辆能否大量制造？如何解决兴修“土”铁路的组织领导和技术领导问题？安徽省在这几个方面都取得了一些经验。
    “土”铁轨质量如何？
    不用钢轨铺铁路，用本省小高炉生产的铁铸造的铁轨，用起来是不是容易断？轨型是否平直？
    蚌埠铁路局九龙岗铸轨厂在铁道科学院的帮助下，试制成功了三种铁轨（每根都是4.1米长）。一是用灰口铁铸造的“⊥”型轨，每米重二十七公斤；一是用85％的灰口铁、15％的白口铁铸造的“工”字型高级铸铁轨，每米重四十八公斤；一是用土球墨铸铁制造的“工”字型轨，每米重四十八公斤。这三类铁轨，经静压试验的结果，二十七公斤轨可承压八到九吨，淮南、蚌埠的“土”铁路经运行证实，铁轨很少断裂；四十八公斤高级铸铁轨可以承压二十五到三十五吨，土球墨铸铁轨可以承压三十五到五十三吨。后两种用铁轨铺设的线路，经ㄇㄎ1机车跑二十五公里时速和ㄇㄎ7机车跑三十五公里时速，铁轨良好无损。现在，轻型轨和高级铸铁轨已由九龙岗铸轨厂、蚌埠铸轨厂和芜湖等地的工厂大量生产。
    铁轨上的道钉、夹板也用代用品制造，节省了许多钢材。道钉是用去年大别山区生产的土钢——木炭炒钢锻造的，夹板用高级铸铁经热处理后制造，质量都良好。
    机车、车辆怎样解决？
    用什么作“土”铁路的机车？九龙岗机务段的职工曾用煤气机试制，用十马力的柴油机试制，也用汽车改制。他们查遍了淮南各种类型的载重汽车，找出汽车前后轮轴长度和铁轨轨距相差不大的两种汽车。他们计算研究了一个多月，用加宽汽车铁轮踏面的办法解决了汽车轮轴比铁轨轨距窄的问题，并且改装了汽车的轮轴部分，把橡胶轮换上生铁轮，加设了变速器和撒沙装置，把汽车改装成“土”机车。这种机车经过在淮南到合肥一百多公里的线路上试验，平均牵引能力为一百吨，相当于普通载重汽车的十倍。它的特点是成本低，容易改制，不需要时还可以还原；同时用油少，每十公里消耗的汽油，等于汽车在公路上行驶同样距离消耗汽油的四分之一。现在，全省已改制了五台，还在陆续改制中。
    蚌埠市的机械厂、造船厂、修配厂的工人，正在用柴油机改制机车，设计能力三百马力，能牵引五百吨以上的重量。在淮南“土”铁路上行驶的机车还有电动机车。
    九龙岗车辆段职工设计制造的“土”铁路车辆，式样和洋铁路的车辆一样，有载重五吨、六吨和九吨的三种（分别自重为一点五吨、二吨、四点六吨）。这种车辆的走行部分比较简单一些，除车轴用元钢外，其余全部用木料和生铁制造。没有弹簧，他们就用洋车辆的废弃弹簧；没有水压机不能把车轮压上轮轴，就请上海铁路局帮助加工。现在，全省已制造好这种车辆六十多辆，大部分是五吨的货车。
    修路工作由谁领导？
    兴修“土”铁路的组织领导和技术领导工作由哪个部门负责最好？安徽省的经验是最好由铁路局负责。原因是：铁路局的经验丰富，可以使修“土”铁路的工作少走弯路，并能保证质量；铁路局的物质、技术力量比较雄厚，联系面广，可以更顺利地解决各种困难问题。
    安徽省的经验证明，“土”铁路同洋铁路比较，具有投资少，成本低，建设快，材料设备易于就地解决，哪里需要就可以在哪里建设等优点；同汽车、板车比较，又有运量大，节省劳力，运费低廉，风雨无阻等优点。
    安徽省的“土”铁路是在各级党委大力领导下发展起来的。中共安徽省委很重视兴建“土”铁路的工作。年初，省委就提出了修“土”铁路的方针：“先易后难，先短后长，先修以煤、铁矿为主的厂矿和物资集中地区”，并且召开现场会议，破除“不能自办铁路”的迷信思想，根据本省钢铁生产能力和各种需要全面安排了今年兴修“土”铁路的线路、材料和制造等工作。省里有一位副省长，各专区、市有交通部长具体领导这一工作。修建过程中，由铁路局担任组织领导和技术领导，各地根据自筹自建的原则，在铁路局的指导下负责修建路基、桥梁、涵洞；铁轨、机车、车辆等由铁路局负责设计、试制，同地方上共同制造。蚌埠铁路局除本局负责的铁路运输、基建两大任务外，把修好“土”铁路列为全局的第三个大任务，专门成立了“地方铁路指导处”，负责“土”铁路的设计、施工和维修等指导工作。全局各段和工程，人事、材料等部门都积极参加了“土”铁路的兴建工作。
