Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 23rd: Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st illegally passed a slanderous proposal against China on the so-called "Tibet problem" put forward by the Irish and Malayan delegations.  U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, in violation of the United Nations Charter, forced the General Assembly to pass a resolution interfering in China's internal affairs and creating a "Cold War," once again exposing the ugly face of imperialist interventionists and adding a new page of shameful record to the history of the United Nations.

When the General Assembly voted on the slanderous proposal by the Irish and Malayan delegations, the nine delegations of socialist countries that voted against it were: Albania, Bulgaria, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union. The twenty-six delegations that abstained were: Afghanistan, Belgium, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia , Finland, France,Ghana, India, Indonesia , Iraq ,  lebanese ,  libyan ,  Morocco ,  nepal ,  Portugal , Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sudan, Federation of South Africa, United Arab Republic, Britain ,  yemen , and Yugoslavia. The forty-five delegations that voted in favor were: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Malaysia, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands,New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Sweden , Thailand ,  tunisia , Turkey, the United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The delegations of Guinea and Costa Rica did not participate in the vote.

In order to confuse people and win support, the illegal Irish-Malayan proposal planned by the United States, although repeatedly revised, did not dare to mention the name of the People's Republic of China, but it still viciously vilified China with shameless slander and lies. Under the hypocritical guise of so-called "respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights," the proposal completely reversed black and white, saying that the General Assembly was "deeply disturbed by reports that the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people have been forcibly deprived—including the official statement of the Dalai Lama" and "regrets the impact of these events on exacerbating international tensions and deteriorating relations between peoples," and "calls for respect for the basic human rights of the Tibetan people and their unique cultural and religious life."

Prior to the vote, the General Assembly continued the debate. Representatives of some countries following the United States continued to slander China, and their slanderous remarks were refuted by representatives of the Soviet Union and socialist countries.

British representative Dixon echoed the US plot to create the so-called "Tibet problem" in his speech. On the one hand, he admitted that Britain had "doubts" as to whether the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the "Tibet issue" violated the Charter, and Britain "doubted" whether the General Assembly's action in passing a resolution was appropriate, and Britain "regretted that it could not support this (Irish-Malayan) draft resolution"; however, on the other hand, Dixon said that the United Kingdom believes that the discussion in the United Nations is "correct" and that he did not know how the United Nations could "turn a blind eye to some things it should pay attention to." Dixon said that the United Kingdom believes that the United Nations cannot take measures of "direct assistance" to Tibet, and the "responsibility" of the representatives is to "speak out loudly to make an impact."

In his speech, Dixon also absurdly referred to Tibet, China's sacred territory, as a "country," and distorted the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion of the upper reactionary clique in Tibet and the democratic reforms in Tibet as a "terrible tragedy for mankind," "forcing people to change their way of life with the tip of a knife." Dixon made no secret of his grief at the suppression of the upper reactionary clique in Tibet's treasonous rebellion. He said that the British government "feels very sad" and "grief-stricken" about what happened in Tibet.

Dutch representative Schulman, who maintained diplomatic relations with China, also danced to the tune of the United States in his speech. He made a big splash about China's "aggression against Tibet" and violation of the so-called "Tibetan human rights," and clamored that "the United Nations cannot ignore the situation in Tibet."

Indian representative and Minister of Defence Menon said in his speech that "discussion does not mean interference." India is not too concerned about the so-called "legal details," and it "will not raise the question of whether such a question cannot be discussed because it is a matter of internal affairs."

The Ethiopian representative said in his speech that he doubted whether those who raised the so-called "Tibet issue" were acting with the goodwill they assured the General Assembly. He emphasized that the United Nations has no right to discuss this issue because Tibet is an integral part of China, and discussing events in this part of China is an interference in China's internal affairs.

Soviet delegation leader Kuznetsov, in explaining the reasons for the vote, said that the vote on the proposal clearly showed that the initiators of the so-called "Tibet issue" had failed to obtain the votes of those countries that they had primarily hoped for and were most concerned about obtaining their support. This is understandable because it is illegal to raise this provocative issue and pass a resolution in the United Nations. We are convinced that this approach is only aimed at exacerbating international tensions, rather than promoting the atmosphere of the realism necessary for the United Nations to establish.

Kuznetsov pointed out that the "Tibet issue" was created to hinder the improvement of the international situation that began with the visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States and the upcoming visit of US President Eisenhower to the Soviet Union. These actions, taken at the initiation and under the pressure of certain imperialist groups, violate the United Nations Charter and undermine the very foundations of the United Nations, which stipulates that the organization shall not interfere in the internal affairs of countries. Those groups who often use the banner of the United Nations to cover up their sinful actions should be held responsible for all this, because their actions damage the interests of maintaining universal peace and the security of peoples.

Representatives from Albania, Byelorussia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine pointed out in their speeches that the presentation of the "Tibet issue" was illegal, violated the United Nations Charter, and was harmful. They pointed out that the purpose of raising the "Tibet issue" in the United Nations was to provoke relations between the People's Republic of China and Asian and African countries, to divide the Bandung Conference countries, and to set a precedent for future interference in the internal affairs of countries struggling for freedom and independence in this region.

Albanian representative Budo pointed out that the presentation of the so-called "Tibet issue" to the General Assembly shows that powerful figures in the West, especially in the United States, are trying to continue to pursue the "Cold War" policy. This "issue" was raised to poison the atmosphere, and the General Assembly should reject the Irish-Malayan proposal.

Hungarian representative Peter Janos said that the so-called "Tibet issue" is the most obvious Cold War issue. Those who demand a discussion on this "issue" have taken actions that endanger the improvement of international relations.

Polish representative Michalowski also spoke against the Irish-Malayan proposal. He said that the entire discussion process in the United Nations shows that the General Assembly has fallen far behind in fulfilling its responsibility to contribute to ending the "Cold War."

Romanian representative Marinescu pointed out that insisting that the United Nations General Assembly discuss the so-called "Tibet issue" is a provocative action aimed at maintaining the "Cold War" and opposing all efforts to ease international tensions and strengthen cooperation between countries. He pointed out that when imperialists and their pawns talk about the "traditional way of life" of the Tibetan people, they are only referring to a state of serfdom.

Ukrainian representative Palamarchuk said that the Chinese government has conscientiously abided by the provisions of the 1951 agreement with the Tibetan local government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and is gradually carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet. He pointed out that the reason why the rebellion of the upper reactionary clique in Tibet was quickly crushed was because the purpose of the rebellion was to harm the vital interests of the Tibetan people. He also said that the discussion of the "Tibet issue" in the United Nations could easily be used in the future as a precedent for interfering in the internal affairs of emerging Asian and African countries. The United Nations should use its time on truly important international issues, rather than getting mired in the quagmire of hating the Chinese people.

    美国挟持联大通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议
    苏联等国代表痛斥帝国主义冷战丑剧
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议21日在美国的操纵下，非法通过了爱尔兰和马来亚代表团就所谓“西藏问题”提出的诽谤中国的提案。美帝国主义及其仆从违反联合国宪章，强使大会通过干涉中国内政和制造“冷战”的一纸提案，又一次暴露了帝国主义干涉者的丑恶面目，并且使联合国的历史增添了一页新的可耻纪录。
    在大会就爱尔兰和马来亚代表团的诬蔑性提案进行表决时，投反对票的是社会主义国家的九个代表团：阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰和苏联。弃权的有二十六个代表团：阿富汗、比利时、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、多米尼加、埃塞俄比亚、芬兰、法国、加纳、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、尼泊尔、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯、西班牙、苏丹、南非联邦、阿拉伯联合共和国、英国、也门和南斯拉夫。投赞成票的有四十五个代表团：阿根廷、澳大利亚、奥地利、玻利维亚、巴西、加拿大、智利、哥伦比亚、古巴、丹麦、厄瓜多尔、萨尔瓦多、马来亚、希腊、危地马拉、海地、洪都拉斯、冰岛、伊朗、爱尔兰、以色列、意大利、日本、约旦、老挝、利比里亚、卢森堡、墨西哥、荷兰、新西兰、尼加拉瓜、挪威、巴基斯坦、巴拿马、巴拉圭、秘鲁、菲律宾、瑞典、泰国、突尼斯、土耳其、美国、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉和蒋介石集团的代表。几内亚和哥斯达黎加代表团没有参加投票。
    为了迷惑人心和争取支持，美国策划的爱尔兰—马来亚非法提案虽经一再修改，没敢提及中华人民共和国的名字，但它仍然是以无耻的诽谤和谎言恶毒地诋毁中国。提案在所谓“尊重联合国宪章原则和世界人权宣言原则”的虚伪幌子下，完全颠倒黑白地说什么大会“对于说西藏人民的基本人权和自由已被强行剥夺的消息——包括达赖喇嘛大师的正式声明——深感不安”，并且对“这些事件对加剧国际紧张局势和恶化各国人民间的关系的影响感到遗憾”，“要求尊重西藏人民的基本人权和他们的独特的文化和宗教生活”。
    在表决之前，大会继续进行辩论。追随美国的一些国家的代表继续诬蔑中国，他们的诽谤谰言遭到苏联和社会主义国家代表的驳斥。
    英国代表迪克逊在发言时附和美国制造所谓“西藏问题”的阴谋。他一方面承认，英国对于联合国大会讨论“西藏问题”是否违反宪章存在“怀疑”，英国对大会通过一项决议的行动是否适当“有怀疑”，英国“很遗憾不能支持这个（爱尔兰—马来亚）决议草案”；但是，另一方面，迪克逊又说，英国认为，联合国的讨论是“正确”的，他不知道联合国怎么能够对“它应该注意的一些事情熟视无睹”。迪克逊说，英国认为，联合国不能采取“直接援助”西藏的措施，代表们的“责任”是“大声疾呼以产生影响”。
    迪克逊在发言中还荒唐地把中国的神圣领土西藏称为“国家”，并且把中国政府平息西藏上层反动集团的武装叛乱和在西藏进行民主改革歪曲成为“人类可怕的悲剧”，“用刀尖迫使人们来改变他们的生活方式”。迪克逊毫不掩饰他对西藏上层反动集团的卖国叛乱被讨平所感到的悲哀。他说，英国政府“对西藏发生的事情感到非常难过”、“悲痛不安”。
    同中国保持有外交关系的荷兰的代表舒尔曼在发言中也跟着美国的调子跳舞。他大弹中国“侵略西藏”、侵犯所谓“西藏人权”的滥调，并且叫嚣“联合国不能对西藏局势置之不理。”
    印度代表、国防部长梅农在发言中说，“讨论并不意味着干涉”。印度对所谓“法律细节”不太关心，它“将不提出是否因为这是内政问题而不能讨论这样的问题”。
    埃塞俄比亚代表在发言中表示，他怀疑提出所谓“西藏问题”的人是否抱着他们向大会保证的那种善意。他着重指出，联合国无权讨论这个问题，因为西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，并且讨论中国这一部分所发生的事件是对中国内政的干涉。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在阐明投票理由时说，提案的表决明显地表明了，所谓“西藏问题”的发起人没有能够获得那些国家的票，这些国家是他们首先寄予希望的，并且最关心得到这些国家的支持的。这一点是可以理解的，因为在联合国提出这个挑衅性问题和通过决议是非法的行动。我们深信，这种做法只是为了加剧国际紧张局势，而不是促进联合国建立必要的实事求是的气氛。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，制造“西藏问题”是为了阻挠由于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问美国和美国总统艾森豪威尔即将访问苏联而开始出现的国际局势的好转。在某些帝国主义集团的发起和压力下采取的这些行动是违背联合国宪章和破坏联合国本身的基础的，联合国宪章规定这个组织不得干涉各国的内政。那些经常打着联合国的旗帜来掩盖自己罪恶行动的集团应当对所有这一切负责，因为他们的行动损害了维护普遍和平和各国人民安全的利益。
    阿尔巴尼亚、白俄罗斯、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚和乌克兰代表在发言中指出，“西藏问题”的提出是非法的、违背联合国宪章的和有害的。他们指出，在联合国提出讨论“西藏问题”的目的是要挑拨中华人民共和国同亚非各国的关系，分裂万隆会议国家并为将来干涉这个地区争取自由和独立而斗争的国家的内政树立先例。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表布多指出，向大会提出所谓“西藏问题”说明了西方、特别是美国的有势力人士力图继续推行“冷战”政策。这个“问题”的提出是为了毒化气氛，大会应当否决爱尔兰—马来亚提案。
    匈牙利代表彼得·亚诺什说，所谓“西藏问题”是一个最明显的冷战问题。那些要求讨论这个“问题”的人们采取了危害国际关系的改善的行动。
    波兰代表米哈沃夫斯基也发言反对爱尔兰—马来亚提案。他说，联合国的整个讨论过程说明，大会远远落在履行对结束“冷战”作出贡献这个职责之后。
    罗马尼亚代表马里内斯库指出，硬要联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”是一个挑衅性行动，它的目的是保持“冷战”和反对缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的合作的一切努力。他指出，当帝国主义者及其爪牙谈到西藏人民的“传统的生活方式”时，他们指的只是一种农奴制的状态。
    乌克兰代表帕拉马尔楚克说，中国政府认真地遵守了1951年同西藏地方政府签订的关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的规定，并且在西藏逐渐进行民主改革。他指出，西藏上层反动集团的叛乱之所以很快地被粉碎是因为叛乱的目的是要危害西藏人民的切身利益。他还说，在联合国进行“西藏问题”的讨论很容易在将来被用来作为干涉新兴的亚洲和非洲国家内政的先例。联合国应当把它的时间用于真正重要的国际问题上，而不是陷到仇恨人民中国的泥坑中去。
