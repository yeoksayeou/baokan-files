Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan stated in a speech in Osaka yesterday that if the Kishi Nobusuke government cannot fundamentally change its policy towards China, then it should resign.

Ishibashi arrived in Osaka on the 27th to hold talks with leaders of Osaka's economic circles.

At a press conference in Osaka, Ishibashi also said, "Frankly speaking, the quickest way to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations is to fundamentally change the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy towards China. However, it will be very difficult to get the Kishi Nobusuke government to do so." He also said, "Since personnel changes can change the political atmosphere, I believe the best way to solve the Japan-China relations issue is for Mr. Kishi Nobusuke to resign."

Ishibashi also said, "When a politician is considered to be hindering the promotion of the country's interests, he should not hesitate on the issue of resignation."

Ishibashi reiterated his position that politics and economics are inseparable in Japan-China relations. He said: "It is wrong to say that politics is one thing and economics is another."

Speaking about the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Ishibashi said, "I have the same idea as Kono Ichiro." He expressed dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government setting the validity period of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to ten years.

    石桥湛山在大阪发表谈话
    要求岸信介辞职解决中日关系问题
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山昨天在大阪发表谈话说：如果岸信介政府不能从根本上改变对中国的政策，那么它就应该辞职。
    石桥是为了同大阪经济界首脑举行会谈，在27日到达大阪的。
    石桥在大阪举行的记者招待会上还说，“坦率地说，打开日中关系僵局的最捷途径是根本改变岸信介政府对中国的政策。但是，让岸信介政府这样做，将是非常困难的。”他还说，“由于人事变动能够改变政治气氛，我相信解决日中关系问题的最好办法是岸信介先生辞职。”
    石桥还说，“当一个政治家被认为妨碍促进国家的利益的时候，他不应该在辞职问题上迟疑不决”。
    石桥重申在日中关系方面政治和经济不可分开的主张。他说：“政治是一回事，经济是另一回事，这样说是错误的。”
    谈到关于修改日美安全条约的问题时石桥说，“我同河野一郎的想法是一样的”。他表示不满岸信介政府把新的日美“安全条约”的有效期限订为十年。
