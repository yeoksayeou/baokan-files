Qinghai Province's iron and steel industry, born during the Great Leap Forward last year, continues to leap forward with vigorous strides this year. By the end of September, the province had produced more than 11,700 tons of pig iron, exceeding the annual pig iron production plan by 17% a quarter ahead of schedule. The newly built Xining Iron and Steel Plant, with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel, also trial-produced two furnaces of steel by the end of September and has already rolled out steel products.

During the mass movement to produce iron and steel last year, Qinghai Province discovered more than 30 iron ore deposits with exploitable value, built thousands of indigenous blast furnaces, and ended Qinghai's history of "having no iron." Over the past year, developing from "small indigenous groups" to "small modern groups," the province has established several small-scale iron smelting bases in Gu Cheng, Xining, Xiaoqiao, and Delingha, and built 61 small blast furnaces with a total volume of 347 cubic meters. This year, the province has used its own pig iron to manufacture more than 600,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral machinery and more than 20,000 iron pots and stoves to support agricultural and pastoral production and supply the needs of farmers and herdsmen. At the same time, indigenous iron rails and mechanical castings were made from the province's pig iron.

The iron and steel workers, who were farmers and herdsmen a year ago, have been doing everything possible to improve the output and quality of pig iron this year. After the publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, their enthusiasm became even higher. In addition, the implementation of advanced experiences such as high blast volume and high temperature has continuously increased the production of pig iron. The pig iron output in the second half of August increased by more than 50% compared with the first half of the month, and the output in the first half of September increased by 42.3% compared with the second half of August. On September 28, a high-yield record of 100 tons and 100 kilograms of pig iron per day was also created. The qualification rate of pig iron has also been greatly improved.

### 青海提前完成全年产铁计划

    青海提前完成全年产铁计划
    本报讯　在去年大跃进中诞生的青海省的钢铁工业，今年以矫健的步伐继续大跃进。到9月底，全省已生产生铁一万一千七百多吨，提前一个季度超额17％完成了今年全年的生铁生产计划。新建的年产十万吨钢的西宁钢铁厂，也在9月底试炼出两炉钢，并已轧出钢材。
    在去年大办钢铁的群众运动中，青海省找到了三十多处有开采价值的铁矿，建起了几千座土高炉，结束了青海“手无寸铁”的历史。一年多来，由“小土群”发展到“小洋群”，全省已建立起古城、西宁、小桥、德令哈等几个小型炼铁基地，建成了六十一座小高炉，总容积达三百四十七立方米。今年，全省已用自己生产的生铁制成六十多万件农牧机具和二万多个铁锅、火炉，支援农牧业生产和供应农牧民生活需要。同时，用本省的生铁制成了土铁轨和机械铸件。
    一年前还是农民、牧民的钢铁工人们，今年千方百计提高了生铁的产量和质量。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，他们的干劲更加高涨。加以推行了大风、高温等多种先进经验，生铁产量不断上升。8月下半月的生铁产量比上半月增长了50％以上，9月上半月又比8月下半月增长42.3％。9月28日，还创造了日产生铁一百吨零一百公斤的高产纪录。生铁合格率也有很大提高。
