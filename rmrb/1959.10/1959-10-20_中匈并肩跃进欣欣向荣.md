Xinhua News Agency, 19th - An enlarged joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People’s Republic of China, and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held this afternoon to warmly welcome the distinguished guest from the fraternal country—István Dobi, President of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic. Chairman Dobi was invited to deliver a lengthy speech at the meeting.

The meeting was held in Huairentang. At 3:00 PM, Liu Shaoqi, President of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and others accompanied Chairman Dobi and Hungarian Ambassador to China, Nogradi, into the venue and onto the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and burst into thunderous applause.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman Zhu De. Chairman Zhu De first delivered a speech at the meeting (full text on page 2) to welcome the distinguished guest. In his speech, he warmly praised the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian people in socialist construction and socialist transformation, praised the great contributions made by the Hungarian people in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, supporting the liberation struggle of oppressed nations, and defending European and world peace, and thanked the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the people for their help and support for the Chinese people's socialist construction and the just struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Amidst the storm of applause from over a thousand people, Chairman Dobi delivered a long speech filled with friendly passion (full text on page 2). He praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, introduced the prosperous scene of the vigorous development of various construction undertakings in the Hungarian People's Republic, and enthusiastically praised the great unity and increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Chairman Dobi said: In Hungary, people are very concerned about the struggle and development of the Chinese people, especially the world-renowned achievements they have made in the year of the Great Leap Forward. In 1958, your industrial production increased by 66%, agricultural production increased by 25%, and on the basis of this year's production achievements, it is entirely possible to expect that the main indicators of your Second Five-Year Plan will be achieved not in 1962 but at the end of 1959. When we heard this news, we were happy along with you.

Chairman Dobi spoke about the deep impression he gained when visiting the People's Commune. He said: "Chinese farmers themselves told me how much their lives have changed. Before liberation, floods and other natural disasters turned tears into rivers, but today the power of unity and collective labor is subduing natural disasters. They said, 'The People's Commune is heaven on earth.' In areas hit by drought, the harvest is even better than in past bumper years. The enthusiasm and talent of the farmers are increasingly brought into play." He said that the People's Commune movement "shows such brilliant achievements and is firmly believed by the masses, we believe it will not be wrong, and it will definitely promote the development of socialism."

Chairman Dobi said: "During the visit, we saw countless signs indicating that the Chinese people are firmly united and are achieving great achievements every day. We saw that the secret of these achievements lies in the absolute belief of the Chinese working people in the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and therefore they enthusiastically follow the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and follow the Party's general line for socialist construction."

Chairman Dobi then introduced the brilliant achievements made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction, especially the more prosperous scene of various construction undertakings in Hungary after the counter-revolutionary riots were put down. He introduced that Hungary's total industrial output value has increased by two times compared with the last peaceful year before liberation, and a series of new industrial sectors have been established. In the past ten years, the total agricultural output value has increased by about 30%. This year, Hungarian farmers have achieved a bumper harvest, and individual farmers, especially middle peasants, have embarked on the road of cooperation in large numbers, and the agriculture of entire states and entire regions has been transferred to the most advanced cooperative components.

Chairman Dobi said: "On the issue of socialist construction and defending the peace of the people of all countries, the opinions of the Chinese and Hungarian people are completely consistent, and they are advancing together under the banner of the victory of Marxism-Leninism, in the big family of the people of all countries building socialism."

Chairman Dobi emphasized: "The firm and unbreakable unity and achievements of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union have fundamentally changed the balance of power between the capitalist and socialist world systems in favor of socialism."

In his speech, Chairman Dobi also expressed warm support for the Soviet government's recent new proposal for comprehensive and thorough disarmament, praised Khrushchev's recent visit to the United States for contributing to easing international tensions, and reiterated that the Hungarian government and people advocate that the United Nations should restore China's legitimate rights and support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Chairman Dobi concluded: "This visit has also further deepened the close friendship and fraternal feelings between our two peoples, which our people cherish very much. We will use all opportunities, in the spirit of the Hungarian-Chinese Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and proletarian internationalism signed not long ago, to use what we have seen and heard during our visit to promote the continuous expansion and strengthening of the relations between our two peoples."

Chairman Dobi's speech aroused bursts of prolonged and enthusiastic applause at the meeting.

After Chairman Dobi delivered his speech, Chairman Zhu De once again delivered a speech, expressing heartfelt and sincere thanks to the distinguished Hungarian guests. He said: "Chairman Dobi has given us a detailed introduction to the current domestic and international situation in Hungary, which has made us more clearly see the prosperous scene of the Hungarian People's Republic and the great confidence and firm will of the Hungarian people in their struggle for lasting peace and building socialism. We are deeply convinced that the Hungarian people will surely be able to continuously achieve new and greater achievements on the glorious road of building socialism and communism. Chairman Dobi's enthusiastic praise for our people fully reflects the fraternal friendship of the Hungarian people towards the Chinese people."

Also present at today's meeting were Lin Boqu, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, and Lin Feng, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, He Long, Chen Yi, Lu Dingyi, and Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Premiers of the State Council, Li Siguang, Burhan, Kang Sheng, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council, Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, heads of government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

    据新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会今天下午举行扩大的联席会议，热烈欢迎来自兄弟之邦的贵宾——匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比·伊斯特万。道比主席应邀在会上发表了长篇演说。
    大会在怀仁堂举行。下午三时，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇、人大常委会委员长朱德、政协全国委员会主席周恩来等，陪同道比主席和匈牙利驻华大使诺格拉第一起进入会场登上主席台。这时，全场起立，掌声雷动。
    会议由朱德委员长主持。朱德委员长在会上首先致词（全文见第二版）欢迎贵宾。他在讲话中热情地赞扬了匈牙利人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造方面取得的辉煌成就，赞扬了匈牙利人民在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、支持被压迫民族的解放斗争和保卫欧洲与世界和平中所作出的巨大贡献，并且感谢匈牙利工农革命政府和人民对中国人民的社会主义建设事业以及维护祖国主权和领土完整的正义斗争的帮助和支持。
    在全场一千多人暴风雨般的欢迎掌声中，道比主席发表了充满友谊激情的长篇演说（全文见第二版）。他赞扬了中国人民在大跃进中取得的巨大成就，介绍了匈牙利人民共和国目前各项建设事业蓬勃发展的繁荣景象，并且热情地歌颂了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和日益强大。
    道比主席在讲话中说：在匈牙利，人们很关切地注视着中国人民的斗争和发展，特别是他们在大跃进的一年里所取得的举世皆知的成就。在1958年里，你们的工业生产提高了66％，农业生产提高了25％，而在今年生产成绩的基础上，完全可以指望不是在1962年而是在1959年年底就将实现你们的第二个五年计划的主要指标。当我们听到这些消息的时候，我们同你们一起感到高兴。
    道比主席谈到了他参观人民公社时所获得的深刻印象。他说：“中国农民们自己告诉我，他们的生活起了多么大的变化。解放前洪水和其他自然灾害使眼泪流成了河，而今天团结和集体劳动的力量正在制服着自然灾害。他们说，‘人民公社是地上的天堂’。在遭受旱灾的地区，收成也比过去的丰收年还好。农民们的积极性和天才日益发挥出来。”他说，人民公社运动“显示出这样光辉的成绩，并且为群众坚信不疑，我们认为它是不会错的，它一定会推进社会主义的发展。”
    道比主席说：“在访问的过程中，我们看到无数的迹象表明中国人民群众牢固地团结一致，每天都在获得巨大的成就。我们看到，这些成就的秘诀在于中国劳动人民绝对相信中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，因而热情地遵循着党和毛泽东同志的指示，遵循着党的社会主义建设的总路线。”
    道比主席接着介绍了匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就，特别是匈牙利人民在扑灭了反革命暴乱以后，各项建设事业更加欣欣向荣的景象。他介绍说，匈牙利的工业总产值已经比解放前最后一个和平年代增加了两倍，建立了一系列新的工业部门。在最近十年内，农业总产值约提高了30％。今年，匈牙利农民取得了特大丰收，个体劳动农民，首先是中农大批地走上了合作化的道路，整州、整区的农业转入了最先进的合作社成分。
    道比主席说：“在社会主义建设和保卫各国人民的和平的问题上，中匈两国人民的意见是完全一致的，并且在马克思列宁主义胜利的旗帜下，在建设社会主义各国人民的大家庭中共同前进。”
    道比主席强调指出：“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的坚定的、牢不可破的团结和取得的成就，使资本主义和社会主义世界体系的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化。”
    道比主席在讲话中还表示热烈支持苏联政府最近关于全面彻底裁军的新建议，赞扬赫鲁晓夫最近访问美国对缓和国际紧张局势作出的贡献，并且再一次重申匈牙利政府和人民主张联合国应该恢复中国的合法地位，支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。
    道比主席最后说：“这次访问也进一步加深了我国人民十分珍视的我们两国人民之间的亲密友谊和兄弟感情。我们将利用一切机会本着不久前签订的匈中友好合作条约和无产阶级国际主义精神，把我们访问的见闻用来促使我们两国人民的关系不断扩大和加强。”
    道比主席的演说，在会场上激起了一阵又一阵长时间的热烈掌声。
    道比主席发表演说以后，朱德委员长再次致词，对匈牙利贵宾表示衷心的、诚挚的感谢。他说：“道比主席给我们详细地介绍了目前匈牙利国内外形势，使我们更加清楚地看到匈牙利人民共和国一片欣欣向荣的繁荣景象，以及匈牙利人民为争取持久和平和建设社会主义而斗争的巨大信心和坚定意志。我们深信，匈牙利人民在建设社会主义和共产主义的光辉道路上一定能够不断地取得新的、更加伟大的成就。道比主席对我国人民的热情赞扬充分体现了匈牙利人民对中国人民的兄弟友情。”
    出席今天会议的，还有人大常委会副委员长林伯渠、罗荣恒、沈钧儒、陈叔通、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、陆定一、习仲勋，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉、康生、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，政府各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领和首都各界人士。
