Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 27th: The Soviet "Pravda" published an observer's article today, stating that while international life is developing in a healthy direction, the United Nations remains an island of the "Cold War," a situation that is intolerable.

The article, titled "Making the United Nations' Cause Conform to the Spirit of the Times," wrote: The lingering stench of the so-called "Tibetan issue" has not yet dissipated from the UN General Assembly, and some people are already preparing new provocations behind the scenes. This provocation is related to the "Laos issue," and some people are preparing to drag this issue to the meeting as well. And it doesn't stop there. For days, rumors have been circulating outside the General Assembly about wanting to revive the "Hungarian issue." On October 22, these rumors were confirmed by the slanderous statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the third anniversary of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion. On October 23, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Lodge also made similar remarks to the press. He wants to bring the clamor surrounding the "Hungarian issue" from the sewer to the General Assembly hall.

"Pravda" continued: Those who are dissatisfied with the good development of international events are attempting to obstruct this development and, if possible, reverse it. However, it is much more difficult for these people to speak so blatantly as they did in the past. Because their position is clearly contrary to the results of the Camp David talks. Therefore, they are taking a detour, looking for other possibilities to obstruct the easing of international tensions, and using the United Nations General Assembly to achieve this disgraceful goal.

The article calls on peace-loving forces to unremittingly struggle to win the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation in the United Nations. The article reminds peace-loving forces that this struggle is far from over.

TASS, Moscow, October 28th: The "Soviet Naval Gazette" published an article on the 28th condemning the recent "Cold War" remarks made by the Supreme Commander of the European Allied Forces of NATO, U.S. General Norstad, and U.S. Army Secretary Brucker.

In an interview with a reporter from the London "Evening Standard," Norstad expressed his unease about the easing of the international situation. He said, "Every suggestion made by Khrushchev regarding peace or disarmament is beneficial to the Russians."

The article's author wrote that Norstad, frightened by the warming of the international atmosphere, is now desperately trying to scare others. The looming crisis of the arms race policy has alarmed such a person.

The author also cited the recent anti-Soviet "Cold War" clamor made by U.S. Army Secretary Brucker. According to Brucker, Greece is threatened by the Soviet Union, so "if it wants to repel the Soviet threat, it must have a strong, modernly equipped army."

### 苏联“真理报”和“苏联海军报”载文揭露  美国制造“冷战”毒化国际气氛

    苏联“真理报”和“苏联海军报”载文揭露
    美国制造“冷战”毒化国际气氛
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表观察家的文章说，正当国际生活正朝着健康的方向发展的时候，联合国仍然是一个“冷战”岛屿，这种情况是不能容忍的。
    这篇题为“使联合国的事业符合于时代精神”的文章写道：联大会场中所谓“西藏问题”的余臭还没有散净，就有人在幕后准备新的挑衅了。这次挑衅同“老挝问题”有关，有人准备把这个问题也拖到会上来。而且还不止此。几天来大会会外一直在谣传想要使“匈牙利问题”借尸还魂。10月22日，这些谣传在美国国务院就匈牙利反革命叛乱三周年发表的污蔑性的声明中得到了证明。10月23日，美国驻联合国代表洛奇也向报界发表了类似的谈话。他要把围绕着“匈牙利问题”的叫嚷从污水桶中带到大会会场中来。
      “真理报”继续写道，那些对国际事件的良好发展心怀不满的人企图阻挠这种发展，有可能的话要使这种发展倒退。不过，这些人要像过去那样明目张胆地说话，那是困难得多了。因为，他们的立场显然是同戴维营会谈的结果背道而驰的。于是，他们就绕道而行，寻找其他的可能性来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，利用联合国大会来达到这个不光彩的目的。
    文章呼吁和平力量不懈地进行斗争，争取和平共处和国际合作的原则在联合国中取得胜利。文章提醒和平力量说，这场斗争还远没有结束。
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科28日讯：“苏联海军报”28日发表文章谴责北大西洋集团欧洲最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德和美国陆军部长布鲁克最近发表的“冷战”言论。
    诺斯塔德在向伦敦“旗帜晚报”记者发表谈话时对国际局势的缓和表示不安。他说，“赫鲁晓夫提出的有关和平或裁军的每一个建议都对俄国人有利”。
    文章作者写道，被国际气氛的暖化吓破胆的诺斯塔德现在拼命来吓唬别人。已经露头的军备竞赛政策的危机使这样一个人惊惶失措了。
    作者还举出了美国陆军部长布鲁克最近发表的反苏的“冷战”叫嚣。据布鲁克说，希腊受着苏联的威胁，因此“如果要回击苏联威胁，它就必须拥有强大的、有现代化技术装备的军队”。
