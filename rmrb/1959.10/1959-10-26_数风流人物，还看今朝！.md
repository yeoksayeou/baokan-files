    To Appreciate Truly Great Men, Look to the Present!
    By Our Correspondent He Changhua
    The era of the Great Leap Forward is an era of heroes. It is the revolutionary masses, heroic in spirit, who have created this great era, and this great era has in turn produced many new heroes. Throughout the five thousand years of our motherland's glorious history, how many heroic figures have emerged? Yet, before the heroes of today, they cannot help but bow their heads in admiration. Truly, to appreciate truly great men, look to the present!
    The working class of Shanghai, with their historically traditional revolutionary determination and pioneering spirit, are advancing with steadfast steps towards new and great goals. It is Chairman Mao's great call and the Party's General Line for socialist construction that have stimulated the political consciousness of the Shanghai working class and mobilized their enormous labor enthusiasm. They are fully exercising their creativity, and this immense power flows like the mighty Yangtze River, rushing forth for thousands of miles.
    Within this torrent of strength, we see wave after wave of roaring surges. These are the tens of thousands of advanced producers and advanced collectives at the grassroots level, the heroes recently selected from the city's more than one million workers and staff. They are loyal executors of the Party's General Line, staunch defenders of the Party's General Line, and the backbone of the Great Leap Forward. They are the cream of the Shanghai working class, the good sons and daughters of the motherland and the Party, and the pride of our great era.
    They dare to uphold the truth, charge into battle for the truth, withstand the ridicule of cold words, resist the impact of great storms and waves, see through the true colors of Right opportunists, refute the fallacies of Right opportunism, and repel the attacks of Right opportunism. Relying on them, uniting the broad masses, we will certainly be able to unswervingly defend the Party's General Line and implement the Party's General Line, and most rapidly build our country into a prosperous, advanced, and great socialist nation.
          Miracles, Miracles!
    Their desire to rapidly change the poor and backward state of the motherland is the most intense, and their ambition to "conquer the earth and build a strong nation" is the most resolute. They are driving the city's more than one million workers and staff to break through all conventions, overcome all difficulties, and valiantly advance towards "high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge" technologies, so that Shanghai, this major industrial base of our country, can play an even greater role in the motherland's socialist construction. They are driving the city's more than one million workers and staff to break through superstitions and enter the "forbidden zones" of thousands of years of science, filling the gaps in our country one by one, and creating countless unprecedented miracles!
    Look, those are the towering power-generating equipment, 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission equipment, massive ships, high-precision grinding machines, one-millionth-of-a-gram microbalances, high-grade woolens, gold pens, radios… Numerous "firsts in our country," countless "high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge" products, are being born here.
    The electron microscope, magnifying 100,000 times, is a comprehensive cutting-edge technology integrating high vacuum, electron optics, and precision machining, capable of distinguishing one thirty-five thousandth of a strand of hair. Some people scoffed, "Young whippersnappers making a fuss, asking for trouble." But, who would have thought that the people who designed and trial-produced the first Chinese-made 100,000-times electron microscope would be nine young people from the Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory? Their average age was only twenty-three, some had just graduated from university, some had just come out of secondary technical school, and some were ordinary technicians and apprentices who had just joined the factory last year. It was they who created the electron microscope in just over six months. Steroid hormones are emerging products in the international pharmaceutical industry in recent years, and "cortisone" is at the cutting edge. Our country originally planned to study and determine its production line in 1960, and begin production at the end of the Third Five-Year Plan. But, who could have imagined that some "clumsy" workers at the General Pharmaceutical Factory, using some earthen devices like bottles, jars, wooden buckets, and porcelain vats, would have made "cortisone" born much earlier. Who could have imagined that an ordinary wire-drawing worker with only a primary school education – Chen Lifeng, a worker at the small and simple Minfeng Copper Wire Processing Factory – could have successfully tested more than fifty kinds of alloy wires, such as new constantan wire, phosphor bronze wire, silicon manganese bronze wire, chromium aluminum iron wire, and manganese copper wire, in just over a year, adding so many new materials to the country and powerfully counteracting the imperialist embargo policy. Who could have imagined that an ordinary female worker who had just shed her illiteracy cap – Zhang Jinmei, who picked green beans and cut pork at the Merlin Canned Food Factory – could have created a green bean picking machine last year, and this year created a meat cutting machine, a celery leaf removal machine, and a pineapple head cutting machine, increasing production efficiency by one to ten times!
    Can people imagine cars running in the city like trains, dragging long tails? There is a "Youth Flying Tigers Team" in Shanghai that used a Liberation brand truck, towing twelve trailers, loaded with one hundred and three tons of cement, passing through the bustling city, and normally passing through countless winding roads, delivering urgently needed cement to the steel plant construction site! People only know that the Earth is very far from the Moon, but they do not know that there is a Shanghai No.ㄎㄈ1—17 locomotive crew that has been driving trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line for thousands of round trips for ten years, transporting nearly ten million passengers, and has never had a traffic accident, and has safely traveled one million five hundred and eighty thousand kilometers, equivalent to two round trips from the Earth to the Moon!
    Faced with so many miracles, in the face of these heroes, how can we not shout loudly, how can we not sing! The creative talents hidden in the hearts of the people who were trampled underfoot by the rulers in the old society are now pouring out like the rushing river. Is this "petty-bourgeois fanaticism"!
                Long Live High Speed
    Our heroes understand the meaning of time best; they understand that the high-speed development of social productive forces is the soul of the General Line for socialist construction; they understand best that the speed of our construction is related to the future of our country and even the world. Therefore, they are tireless and seize every second. They fiercely attacked those who advocate "low speed," withstood the cold wind that came for a time, and persisted in the struggle for high speed. They told time to obey their orders, and in every part, every process, and every operation, they used their whole body and mind to overcome difficulties and win time, so that many people completed the workload of a whole year, two years, three years, five years… in just a few months. "Seizing every second" is not an abstract slogan or concept here, but a manifestation of the heroes' and the broad masses' will to enthusiastically support the General Line!
    In the textile industry, some people opposed accelerating the speed of the machines, believing that the maximum speed for spinning 21-count yarn could only be 230 revolutions, which was a matter of course, and it would be very dangerous to take another step. Some people also saw the increase in yarn breakage at the beginning of the speed increase and shouted "it is not worth the loss." However, the female heroes of the Yi Shijuan group of the No. 2 State Cotton Mill boldly broke through the shackles of the so-called "dangerous speed" and withstood the yarn breakage and this small cold wind. In the Great Leap Forward last year, they first continuously accelerated the speed of spinning 21-count weft yarn from 280 revolutions to 400 revolutions; in September this year, they turned on all the spinning machines to an unbelievable 500 revolutions. They worked hard and practiced diligently, mastered the patrol rules after accelerating the speed, made the speed jump to 500 revolutions, and the yarn breakage rate was still almost the same as the 200+ revolutions before the Great Leap Forward last year, and the first-class and first-grade rate of cotton yarn has always maintained an advanced level of 100%.
    In the struggle to defend the General Line in weaving, Ni Haibao, a weaving expert from the No. 9 State Cotton Mill, is a brave vanguard. Ni Haibao and the workers in the workshop developed a style of daring to think, speak, and act, and greatly accelerated the speed of the old machines that have been around for more than 60 years. However, at the beginning, the number of stops increased, the joining of threads could not keep up, and the original working method was disrupted. Some people who originally had Rightist ideas shouted even more at this time: "It is better not to speed up than to have so many stops!" Most workers were still full of confidence in high-speed production, but a few people became alarmed. Everyone paid close attention to whether Ni Haibao's machine could withstand it, because she had been rated as a Shanghai labor model and advanced producer for several consecutive years. The brave Ni Haibao adopted a firm attitude and accepted the severe test. On the one hand, she encouraged everyone to fight against difficulties, and on the other hand, she eliminated all difficulties and improved her working methods to make her machine run better, using facts to criticize those who doubted high speed. More importantly, she tried every means to shorten the shuttle change time and the time to deal with stops by one second at a time. One second, at this time, has such a great significance. In order to shorten the shuttle change time from 2.7 seconds to 1.8 seconds (generally 4-5 seconds), just to shorten 0.9 seconds, she tried every means to create a set of shuttle change operations after high speed. In order to change the "卡接头" to "double-winding joints," so that the joints were firm, fast, small, without gaps, and non-detachable, Ni Haibao practiced tying knots whenever she had the opportunity before and after meetings and during breaks. Sometimes she practiced hard in bed at night, and even when she fell asleep, she was still holding the yarn end in her hand. As a result, the time to deal with stops was "reduced from an average of eleven seconds to 5.8 seconds." Ni Haibao set up a more advanced example in the struggle to defend the General Line in this way.
    In the shipbuilding industry, some people also shouted: "Ships are not made of paper, such a fast shipbuilding speed is impossible." However, in the Great Leap Forward last year, the Jiangnan Shipyard launched a 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel with a 70-day slipway cycle, and its speed surpassed that of Japan, which is famous for shipbuilding. In this year's continued Great Leap Forward, they launched another 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel with a 35-day slipway cycle, and the speed was even more amazing. The Hudong Shipyard also recently launched a 3,000-ton ocean-going vessel with a 19-day slipway cycle, also creating an unprecedented new record. Such high speed shocked those with Rightist ideas!
              The Ambition of the Working Class
    It is unimaginable that there are no difficulties on our way forward to conquer nature and develop productive forces. It is unimaginable that there are no difficulties in rapidly building our country, a large country with a population of 650 million and a backward industrial base, into a strong socialist country and catching up with the level of advanced countries in the world. Every creation and every achievement of the tens of thousands of heroes in Shanghai has been achieved by overcoming many difficulties. The birth of the domestic hormone "cortisone" has experienced more than 170 failures.
    The problem lies in the attitude towards difficulties. As long as we give full play to human subjectivity and master objective laws, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Only those petty-bourgeois fantasists who fantasize about "smooth sailing" on the way forward will be frightened by difficulties. Our working class has its own philosophy of dealing with difficulties, that is, as the heroes often say: the more difficulties, the greater the enthusiasm. They have the ambition of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, and they have the perseverance of Jingwei who filled the sea.
    Among the workers of the Yimin Food Factory No. 4, there is a moving story of "One Leaf of Remaining Lung, One Red Heart":
    There is an old worker in this factory, He Baojing, who is approaching retirement age, short in stature, thin in face, and his weak body seems to be blown away by a gust of wind. He has had a lobe of his left lung removed due to a serious lung disease, and also suffers from severe "gastric ptosis." However, the old worker has a red heart loyal to the Party and loyal to the socialist cause, and is a technical innovation pioneer with a fearless spirit who dares to think, speak, and act.
    In order to solve the manual operation of biscuit making for his class brothers, the old man endured the pain of the disease and successfully created automated equipment such as a pancake baking plate joint machine and an automatic unloading machine, fundamentally changing the appearance of biscuit manufacturing, so that workers are freed from the heavy labor of carrying tens of thousands of pounds every day, and industrial injuries such as burns, bumps, and sprains are eliminated, greatly improving labor productivity. The automatic strip extrusion machine he recently created has a daily output of 12,000 pounds, which is equivalent to the production of a medium-sized factory.
    In these innovations, He Baojing, who cannot even write a few Arabic numerals properly, often fought hard day and night, dragging his weak body. During the day, he drew sketches on the floor with chalk. At night, he rested his chin on his left hand and racked his brains alone in his pavilion room. He said: "We communists are not afraid of difficulties. Although I only have half a lung, as long as I can still breathe, I will definitely persevere." Sometimes, the "gastric ptosis" problem also occurred, but he still insisted on working. The doctor prescribed him sick leave many times, but he often stuffed it into his pocket and went to the factory as usual. In order to take care of his body, the Party had agreed with him: if he came to the factory, he only needed to use his brain to give guidance, and let the young workers do the work. However, once the work started, he threw everything about using his brain but not his hands to the back of his mind. He said:
  "It would be more uncomfortable than being subjected to torture if I only used my mouth and not my hands!"
              Plant the Red Flag on Everyone
    Our heroes are not only skilled at studying hard and innovating boldly, but also noble people who "leave the difficulties to themselves and give the convenience to others."
    They are not for personal honor, nor for the honor of small collectives, but for the common and lofty socialist construction cause, so they always regard the difficulties of others as their own difficulties; wherever there are difficulties, they rush there. As soon as they create advanced experience, they immediately tell their competitors and teach everyone without reservation. Many of them volunteered to go to backward groups to help every class brother progress and plant the red flag of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward on everyone. They regard this as their greatest honor and greatest happiness. They deeply understand: "One flower cannot decorate the spring, only when a hundred flowers bloom can the garden be full of spring."
    The red flag bearer Cao Huiju helped the slow hand Kong Zili win the red flag, which is one of many examples.
    Cao Huiju is a young grinding female worker in the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory. She is a fast hand and was transferred to the Yonghe Needle Factory to support and exchange cars with Kong Zili of the Yonghe Factory. Kong Zili has always been called a slow grinding hand by others, with a production output that is half that of others, and many waste products. Some workers in the group asked to transfer her away. And she, with a sad face, often secretly shed tears.
    Cao Huiju sympathized with her very much, understood that she was not willingly lagging behind, but had specific difficulties, and decided to help her. Cao Huiju first made up for Kong Zili's shortfall and completed the group's plan by doing more work herself. Later, she also learned that Kong Zili's car was far away, and it was very difficult to pull up the towing plate, which often made people sore and aching in their backs, so she exchanged her light and flexible car for Kong Zili's. She also often stood behind Kong Zili and observed her operation. Sometimes she even held Kong Zili's hand and taught her the technique of grinding needles.
    Cao Huiju also considered that Kong Zili had many children at home. Although she also had two children, she had her mother-in-law to take care of them, so she suggested that Kong Zili work the day shift and she work the night shift.
    One night, Cao Huiju slept in Kong Zili's house and could not fall asleep for a long time. She felt that Kong Zili's biggest difficulty was that no one took care of the housework and no one took care of the children…. Strong class feelings moved her. Thinking about it, she got out of bed and secretly washed the children's diapers for Kong Zili, mopped the floor, and took care of everything, then tiptoed out the door and went to the factory to work.
    Cao Huiju's spirit inspired the other workers in the group. Everyone came to help Kong Zili, and Kong Zili herself secretly made up her mind. Kong Zili quickly improved, and won the glorious title of red flag bearer in May. Cao Huiju did not get the red flag this month, but she was happier than if she had gotten the red flag herself.
    She was happy for Kong Zili's progress, but since the exchange of cars, her own output and quality had declined sharply. She did not complain at all, nor did she bow her head to difficulties. She worked hard to familiarize herself with the performance of the car, correct the car, learn from the advantages of others, and improve her operating skills. In June, July, and August, Cao Huiju was re-elected as a red flag bearer.
    What a thrilling communist paean! Let us sing to our heart's content!
    Our Party, our country, our era, need such people who dare to break through all conventions, dare to overcome all difficulties, dare to charge into battle for the truth, dare to continue to leap forward, and dare to sacrifice themselves for others!
    Under the call of our wise Chairman Mao, they are driving the broad masses of workers and staff to promote our socialist construction cause at high speed.
    Now, they have elected the most outstanding representatives – 432 advanced collectives and advanced producers – from Shanghai to come to the capital to report their achievements to our dear Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and accept new combat missions.

    数风流人物，还看今朝！
    本报记者　贺昌华
    大跃进的时代是英雄的时代。是英雄的革命群众创造了这伟大的时代，伟大的时代又造就了许多新的英雄。五千年来，在祖国光辉的历史上出现了多少英雄人物，而他们在今天的英雄们面前，不禁要俯首折腰。正是：数风流人物，还看今朝！
    富有革命坚定性和革命首创精神历史传统的上海工人阶级，迈着坚定的步伐，正在向新的伟大目标猛进。是毛主席的伟大召唤和党的社会主义建设总路线，激发了上海工人阶级的政治觉悟，调动了上海工人阶级巨大的劳动热情。他们充分发挥自己的创造力，这种巨大的力量滚滚如长江之水，一泻千里。
    在这万道巨流之中，我们看到了一个个奔腾咆哮的浪头。那就是数万个基层的先进生产者和先进集体，全市一百多万职工群众刚刚挑选出来的英雄。他们，是党的总路线忠实的执行者，是党的总路线坚强的保卫者，是大跃进的中坚。他们，是上海工人阶级的精华，是祖国和党的好儿女，是我们伟大时代的骄傲。
    他们敢于坚持真理，为真理冲锋陷阵，经得起冷言冷语的讽刺，顶得住大风大浪的冲击，看得穿右倾机会主义分子的真面目，驳得倒右倾机会主义的谬论，打得退右倾机会主义的进攻。依靠他们，团结广大群众，一定能够坚定不移地保卫党的总路线和贯彻党的总路线，最迅速地把我国建设成为富强的、先进的、伟大的社会主义国家。
          奇迹，　奇迹！
    他们要迅速改变祖国贫穷和落后面貌的愿望最为强烈，要“战胜地球、建立强国”的志气最为坚决。他们带动着全市一百多万职工群众，突破一切陈规，战胜一切困难，勇猛地向“高大精尖”进军，使我国这个大工业基地——上海在祖国的社会主义建设事业中发挥更为巨大的作用。他们带动着全市一百多万职工群众，冲破迷信，闯进千百年科学的“禁地”，一个个填着我们国家的空白点，创造了多少亘古未有的奇迹！
    看吧，那就是他们和群众一起制造出来的高大的发电设备，22万伏超高压输电设备，庞大的轮船，高精度的磨床，百万分之一克的微量天平，高级的呢绒、金笔、收音机……。无数的“我国第一台”，无数的“高大精尖”产品，在这里诞生了。
    放大十万倍的电子显微镜，是一种高真空、电子光学和精密机械加工的综合性的尖端技术，能够鉴别出一根头发丝的三万五千分之一。某些人嗤笑过“毛头小伙子胡闹，自讨苦吃”。可是，谁也没有想到，设计、试制第一台中国型十万倍电子显微镜的人，竟是上海光学仪器厂的九个年轻人。他们的平均年龄只有二十三岁，有的刚从大学毕业，有的刚从中等技术学校出来，还有的是去年进厂的普通技工和学徒。就是他们，仅用了六个多月的时间就把电子显微镜创造出来了。甾体激素是最近几年国际医药工业的新兴产品，“可的松”又是其中的尖端，我国原拟在1960年研究确定它的生产路线，第三个五年计划末期开始生产。可是，谁又能够想到，通用药厂的一些“粗手笨脚”的职工，用一些瓶瓶罐罐、木桶瓷缸之类的土家伙，使“可的松”大大地提早诞生了。谁又能够想到，一个原来只有初小文化程度的普通拉丝工人——小而简陋的民丰铜丝加工厂工人陈礼凤，能够在一年多来试验成功新康铜丝、磷铜丝、矽锰青铜丝、铬铝铁丝、锰铜丝等五十几种合金线材，为国家增加那么多新材料，有力地回击了帝国主义的禁运政策。谁还能够想到，一个刚摘掉文盲帽子的普通女工——梅林罐头食品厂拣青豆、切猪肉的张金妹，能在去年创造了一部拣青豆机，今年又创造了切肉机、芹菜去叶机和菠萝切头机，使生产效率提高了一倍到十倍！
    人们能够想像汽车像火车那样，拖着长长的尾巴在城市奔跑吗？上海有一个“青年飞虎队”，用一辆解放牌汽车，挂着十二辆拖车，满载一百零三吨水泥，穿过热闹的市区，正常地通过了数不清的弯弯曲曲的马路，给钢厂建筑工地送去紧急需要的水泥！人们只知道地球距月亮很远，还不知道上海有一个ㄎㄈ1—17号机车包乘组，十年来驱着火车在沪宁线上奔驰了数千个来回，运送了近千万名旅客，从未发生过一次行车责任事故，已安全行驶了一百五十八万公里，相当于地球到月亮的两个来回！
    面对着这许多奇迹，在这些英雄们的面前，我们怎能不高呼，我们怎能不歌唱！在旧社会被统治者践踏在脚底下的人们，潜藏在心底里的创造才能，今天像江水奔腾一样地倾泻出来了。这难道是“小资产阶级的狂热性”吗！
                高速度万岁
    我们的英雄，最懂得时间的意义；最懂得高速度发展社会生产力，是社会主义建设总路线的灵魂；最懂得我们建设速度的快慢，关系着我国乃至世界的前途。因此，他们马不停蹄，分秒必争。他们猛烈地冲击那些“低速论”者，顶住了一时袭来的冷风，坚持着高速度的斗争。他们叫时间听自己的命令，在每一个部件、每一道工序、每一次操作中，都用自己整个身心，去战胜困难，赢得时间，以致很多人只用了几个月的时间就完成了全年、二年、三年、五年……的工作量。“分秒必争”，在这里不是什么抽象的口号和概念，是英雄和广大群众热烈拥护总路线的意志力量的表现！
    在纺织工业中，有一些人反对加快车速，认为纺二十一支纱的最高车速只能开到二百三十转，这是天经地义，再跨过一步就十分危险了。也有人看到车速加快初期断头增多，而大喊“得不偿失”。但是，国棉二厂裔式娟小组的女英雄们，大胆地冲破了所谓“危险速度”的束缚，顶住了断头和这小股冷风，去年大跃进中首先把纺二十一支纬纱的车速从二百八十转连续加快到四百转；今年9月，又把全部细纱车开到令人难以置信的五百转。她们勤学苦练，掌握了加快车速以后的巡回规律，使车速跃到五百转，而断头率仍同去年大跃进以前两百多转的差不多，棉纱的一等一级品率一直保持在100％的先进水平。
    在织布方面的捍卫总路线的斗争中，国棉九厂的织布能手倪海宝是一名勇敢的急先锋。倪海宝和车间里的工人，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的风格，把六十多年的老机器的速度大大加快了。但是，开始时停台增多，接头来不及，原来的工作法被打乱了。一些本来有右倾思想的人，这时更是叫喊：“与其停台多，不如不加速！”大多数工人对高速生产仍然信心十足，但也有少数人惊惶失措起来。大家很注意倪海宝的车子是否挡得住，因为她是连续几年被评为上海市劳动模范和先进生产者。勇敢的倪海宝，采取了坚定的态度，接受了严重的考验。她一面鼓励大家向困难作斗争，一面排除万难，改进工作方法，把自己的车子挡得更好，以事实批驳了怀疑高速的人。更重要的，她千方百计地一秒钟一秒钟地缩短换梭时间和处理停台的时间。一秒钟，在这时有着多么重大的意义。她为了把换梭时间从2.7秒缩短到1.8秒（一般要4——5秒），仅仅缩短0.9秒，千方百计地创造了一套高速以后的换梭操作法。为了把“佧接头”改为“双绕接头”，使头接得牢、接得快、接得小、没空接、不脱接，倪海宝在开会前后，休息时，一有机会就练习打结。有时夜里睡在床上也在苦练，人睡着了，手里还拿着纱头。结果，使处理停台的时间“从平均十一秒降低到5.8秒。倪海宝就这样的在捍卫总路线的斗争中，又树起了先进更先进的榜样。
    在造船工业中，也曾经有人嚷叫过：“船不是纸糊的，这样快的造船速度不可能。”但是，在去年大跃进中，江南造船厂以七十天的船台周期，下水了一艘五千吨海轮，速度压倒了造船著名的日本。在今年的继续大跃进中，他们再以三十五天的船台周期，下水了另一艘五千吨海轮，速度更加惊人。沪东造船厂最近也曾经以十九天的船台周期，下水了一艘三千吨海轮，也创造了空前未有的新纪录。这样的高速度，使那些有右倾思想的人震惊不已！
              工人阶级的志气
    要战胜自然、发展生产力，在我们前进的道路上没有困难，那是不可想像的。要把我们这样一个拥有六亿五千万人口、工业基础落后的大国，迅速建成社会主义强国，赶上世界先进国家的水平，没有困难，那是不可想像的。上海数万个英雄的每一项创造，每一项成绩，都是克服了很多困难才取得的。国产激素“可的松”的诞生，就曾经经受过一百七十多次的失败。
    问题在于对待困难的态度。只要充分发挥人的主观能动性，掌握客观规律，就没有战胜不了的困难。只有那些幻想前进途中“风平浪静”的小资产阶级幻想家，才会被困难吓倒。我们工人阶级有我们自己对待困难的哲学，那就是如英雄们常说的：困难越多，干劲越大。他们有愚公移山的志气，他们有精卫填海的毅力。
    在益民食品四厂的工人中，流传着一个激动人心的“一叶残肺，一颗红心”的故事：
    这个厂里有一位快到退休年龄的老工人何宝镜，矮小的身材，瘦削的面孔，衰弱的身体就像一阵风吹得走似的。他因为患严重的肺病已经切除了一叶左肺，另外还患有严重的“胃下垂”。但是，老工人却具有一颗忠于党忠于社会主义事业的红心，是一个具有大无畏精神敢想敢说敢做的技术革新闯将。
    老人为了解决阶级弟兄们制造饼干的手工操作的劳累，忍受着病魔的苦痛，创造成功了自动化的烙饼运盘联合机、自动出炉机等设备，根本改变了饼干的制造面貌，使工人从此摆脱每日数以万斤计的负重劳动，杜绝了烫伤、碰伤、扭伤等工伤事故，大大地提高了劳动生产率。最近他刚创造成功的一台自动挤条机，日产量是一万二千斤，相当于一个中小型厂的生产。
    在这些革新中，连几个阿拉伯字也写得不像样的何宝镜，拖着衰弱的身体，常常日夜苦战。白天，用粉笔在地板上画草图。夜晚，他把下巴搁在左手上，一个人在自己的亭子间里动脑筋。他说：“我们共产党员是不怕困难的，我虽然只有半只肺，只要还能呼吸，一定坚持下去。”有时候，“胃下垂”毛病也发起来，他还是坚持工作。医生给他开过多次病假单，他常常往衣袋里一塞，照常到厂。党为了照顾他的身体，曾和他约定：如果到厂，只要动脑作指导，干活的事让小青工来。但是，工作一开始，什么动脑不动手，都被他一古脑儿抛到九霄云外了。他说：
  “真要我动嘴不动手，那比上刑法还难受哩！”
              把红旗插到每个人
    我们的英雄，不但是一些刻苦钻研、大胆革新的能手，而且也是一些“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的高尚的人。
    他们不是为了个人的荣誉，也不是为了小集体的荣誉，而是为了共同的崇高的社会主义建设事业，所以他们总是把别人的困难，当作自己的困难；那里有困难，就赶到那里。他们一创造出先进经验，马上告诉竞赛对手，毫无保留地教给大家。他们不少人自愿到落后小组去，帮助每一个阶级弟兄进步，把总路线和大跃进的红旗插到每一个人。他们把这些当作个人最大的荣誉，最大的幸福。他们深深懂得：“一枝花点缀不了春天，只有百花齐放，才能春色满园。”
    红旗手曹慧菊帮助慢手孔自力夺得红旗，就是许多事例中的一个。
    曹慧菊是上海缝纫机制针厂的青年磨平女工，是个快手，调到永和制针厂来支援，同永和厂的孔自力车换车。孔自力一向被别人称为磨平慢手，产量比别人低一半，废次品又多，小组有些工人要求把她调走。而她，愁眉苦脸，常常偷偷地掉眼泪。
    曹慧菊很同情她，了解她并不是自甘落后，而是有具体困难，决定帮助她。曹慧菊首先用自己多做工作的办法，来弥补孔自力的缺额，完成小组计划。后来，又了解到孔自力的车子距离长，拖板拉起来很吃力，常常累得人腰酸背痛，便把自己的一部轻巧灵活的车子调换给了孔自力。还常常立在孔自力的背后，观察她的操作。有时甚至拉着孔自力的手，教给她磨针的技巧。
    曹慧菊又考虑到孔自力家里孩子多，自己虽然也有两个孩子，但有婆婆照顾，便建议让孔自力做日班，自己做夜班。
    一天晚上，曹慧菊睡在孔自力家里，久久不能入寝。她感到，孔自力最大的困难是家务没人料理，孩子没人照顾……。强烈的阶级感情激动着她，想着想着，她从床上爬起来，偷偷地替孔自力洗小孩的尿布，拖地板，一切料理得好好的，然后才蹑手蹑脚地关好门，到工厂去上工。
    曹慧菊这种精神，鼓舞了小组的其他工人。大家都来帮助孔自力，孔自力自己也暗暗下定了决心。孔自力很快的进步了，5月份获得了红旗手的光荣称号。这个月，曹慧菊没有得到红旗，但她比自己得到红旗还要高兴。
    她为孔自力的进步高兴，但是，从调换车子以后，自己的产量、质量却直线下降了。她丝毫没有怨言，也不向困难低头，她努力去摸熟车子的性能，把车子校正，学习别人的优点，并且改进了操作技术。6、7、8月，曹慧菊又重新被评为红旗手。
    这是多么激动人心的共产主义凯歌！让我们尽情地歌唱吧！
    我们的党，我们的国家，我们的时代，是多么需要这样一些敢于突破一切陈规、敢于战胜一切困难、敢于为真理冲锋陷阵、敢于不断跃进、敢于舍己为人的人！
    在我们英明的毛主席的召唤下，他们带动着广大职工群众，把我们的社会主义建设事业高速度地推向前进。
    现在，他们推选出了最优秀的代表——四百三十二个先进集体和先进生产者，从上海来到首都，向我们亲爱的毛主席和党中央汇报成绩，接受新的战斗任务。
