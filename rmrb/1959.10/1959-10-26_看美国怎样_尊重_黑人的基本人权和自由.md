    See How the United States "Respects" the Basic Human Rights and Freedoms of Black People

    Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly passed an illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue." The resolution slandered our country under the guise of so-called "respect for basic human rights and freedoms." This was an extremely shameful farce. It is common knowledge that it is the U.S. ruling class that is still cruelly and viciously torturing and killing black people, and it is the imperialist bloc headed by the United States that is constantly and barbarously destroying the human rights of the broad masses of colonial people. Let's see how the basic human rights and freedoms of black people in the United States are "respected":

    It has been ninety-seven years since Lincoln issued the "Emancipation Proclamation," and eighty-four years since the passage of the U.S. Civil Rights Act, but the basic human rights and freedoms of black people, who account for 11% of the U.S. population, have still not been realized. In the United States, persecution of black people is commonplace and is encouraged and condoned by the U.S. government. Shocking crimes of torturing and killing black people include: lynching, shooting, throwing bombs, kidnapping, castration, rape, and beatings, etc., are endless. According to a joint report by three organizations, including the "American Friends Service Committee," from January 1, 1955, to January 1 this year, there were as many as 530 incidents of racial persecution involving murder, assault, explosions, and mob attacks in the southern United States.

    The Little Rock incident in September 1957, which shocked the world, was an event in which American racists, with the support of the government, blatantly persecuted black people in broad daylight. Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas, and the governor of this state openly dispatched 250 National Guardsmen equipped with pistols, rifles, and tear gas to prevent black students from entering the school. Racists gathered at the school gate, verbally abused and threatened black students who were preparing to enter the school, and beat black journalists present. Incidents of attacks on black people also occurred successively throughout Little Rock. This crime aroused the indignation of the people of the world, but the American racists did not stop there. In 1958, incidents of mistreatment of black students continued to occur in Little Rock, including beatings, pushing down stairs, and pouring hot soup.

    There are many incidents similar to Little Rock. For example, in mid-February 1957, racists in Clinton, Tennessee, carried out their eighth premeditated explosion in order to prevent black and white students from attending classes together, injuring a black woman and an infant, and damaging about thirty black residences and a black hotel. In November 1958, an explosion also occurred at a school in Osage City, West Virginia, because of "black and white integration." On September 2, 1957, due to the enrollment issue, Ku Klux Klan members in Alabama beat a young black man, Judge Aaron, unconscious and then cut off his genitals.

    The U.S. government and courts often use fabricated charges to execute innocent black people. For example, in 1957, a twenty-six-year-old black youth, Hamilton, in Birmingham, Alabama, was falsely accused of committing the "crime" of "attempting to rape" an elderly white woman and sentenced to death. In the winter of the same year, the Alabama court unreasonably sentenced a black sharecropper, Wilson, to death. His crime was allegedly stealing one dollar and ninety-five cents from a white woman. Wilson was not even allowed to appear in court during the trial and sentencing. In 1958, in Dawson, Georgia, a black man was beaten by the police for no reason and died a few days later due to severe brain injuries. Another black man was shot and killed by the police for no reason. Even a black woman was detained when she went to the prison to visit her son. On August 27, Foster, a seventeen-year-old black youth in Montgomery, Alabama, was beaten to death by the police for no reason. The "reason" was that he had "insulted" a white woman on the phone. In January of this year, police in Newark, New Jersey, unreasonably beat the black Simmons couple. They used thick clubs to beat the pregnant Mrs. Simmons in the abdomen. Simmons suffered thirty-seven injuries, and four fingers were broken. In Monroe, North Carolina, two black children, aged eight and nine, were arrested by the police and tried in court, sentencing them to long prison terms of more than ten years and sending them to "reformatory prisons" on the grounds of "insulting and attempting to rape" white girls. Later, under the protests of the public at home and abroad, the U.S. authorities had to release these two innocent children in January of this year.

    American racists use lynching to kill black people, incurring countless blood debts. Since 1882, when statistics began in Mississippi in the southern United States, there have been 578 lynching cases. It ranks first in this disgraceful crime record. Others include Texas—493 cases, and Georgia—491 cases. In April of this year, Parker, a 23-year-old black driver in Mississippi, was severely beaten in prison by rioters and then dragged out of prison and lynched.

    From these recent examples in the past two or three years alone, we can see the hideous face of American imperialists frantically torturing and killing black people and trampling on their basic human rights and freedoms at home. These facts are a great irony to the pretense of American "humanitarians." (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)

### 看美国怎样“尊重”黑人的基本人权和自由

    看美国怎样“尊重”黑人的基本人权和自由
    在美帝国主义的操纵下，联合国大会十四届会议通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议。决议打着所谓“尊重基本人权和自由”的幌子来污蔑我国。这是一幕极其可耻的丑剧。人所共知，还在残酷恶毒虐杀黑人的正是美国统治阶级，不断野蛮摧残广大殖民地人民的人权的正是以美国为首的帝国主义集团。试看美国国内黑人的基本人权与自由是怎样受到
  “尊重”的吧：
    林肯发表的“释放黑奴”宣言已有九十七年了，美国公民权利法案通过也有八十四年了，但占美国人口11％的黑人的基本人权和自由至今仍不能实现。在美国，迫害黑人是司空见惯的事，而且受到美国政府的鼓励和纵容，骇人听闻的虐杀黑人的罪行包括：私刑处死、枪杀、扔炸弹、劫持、阉害、强奸和殴打等等，层出不穷。仅据“美国公谊服务会”等三个组织的联合报告，从1955年1月1日到今年1月1日，美国南部发生的杀人、殴打、爆炸和聚众袭击的种族迫害事件就有五百三十起之多。
    1957年9月轰动世界的小石城事件，就是美国种族主义者在政府支持下，在光天化日下明目张胆地迫害黑人的事件。小石城是阿肯色州的首府，这个州的州长公然派二百五十名的国民警卫队配备了手枪、步枪、催泪弹在学校门前阻止黑人学生进入学校，种族主义者聚集在学校门口，辱骂和威胁准备入学的黑人，并殴打在场的黑人记者。小石城内各处也陆续发生袭击黑人的事件，这桩罪行引起世界人民的震愤，可是美国的种族主义者并未从此住手，在58年，小石城虐待黑人学生的事件继续不断发生，其中包括殴打、从楼梯上推下和泼热汤等各色各样的方式。
    类似小石城的事件是很多的，例如57年2月中旬，田纳西州克林敦的种族主义分子为了阻止黑白学生合并上课，就进行了第八次预谋爆炸，炸伤一名黑人妇女和婴儿，炸坏三十所左右的黑人住宅和一家黑人饭店。58年11月西弗吉尼亚奥萨基城的一所学校也因“黑、白人合校”而发生爆炸案。57年9月2日，因入学问题，亚拉巴马州的三K党徒竟将一个黑人青年贾治·阿隆打昏，然后将他的生殖器割掉。
    美国政府和法庭常以虚构的罪名来处死无辜黑人。例如57年亚拉巴马州伯明翰城一个二十六岁的黑人青年汉密尔顿被诬告为犯了“企图强奸”一个白人老妇的“罪名”而判处死刑。同年冬季，亚拉巴马州的法庭无理判处黑人雇农威尔逊以死刑，他的罪名据说是盗窃了一个白人妇女的一元九角五分钱，在审讯和宣判死刑时，甚至不让威尔逊本人到庭。58年单在佐治亚州道逊城，就有一个黑人无故遭到警察的毒打，几天后因脑部受伤过重而死亡。另一个黑人也无端被警察开枪打死，甚至连一个黑人妇女到监狱探望儿子时也被禁起来。8月27日，亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利城的十七岁黑人青年福斯特被警察平白打死，“理由”据说是他曾在电话里“污辱”了一个白人妇女。今年一月新泽西州纽瓦克城的警察无理毒打黑人西蒙斯夫妇，他们用粗木棍殴打怀了孕的西蒙斯妻子的腹部，西蒙斯受伤三十七处，四个手指被打断。在北卡罗来纳州门罗城两个年方八岁和九岁的黑人小孩，竟被警察逮捕和法院审理，把他们判处十余年的长期徒刑，送进“感化监狱”，罪名是“侮辱和企图强奸”白人女孩，后来在国内外公众的抗议下，美国当局才不得不在今年1月将这两个无辜小孩释放。
    美国种族主义者用私刑杀害黑人，血债累累，美国南部的密士失必州从1882年进行统计以来，就发生私刑案件五百七十八起，它在这个不光彩的罪行纪录中占据首位，其他如得克萨斯州——四百九十三起，佐治亚州——四百九十一起。在今年4月密士失必州二十三岁黑人司机帕克竟被暴徒先在监狱中毒打，以后又把他从狱中拖走，用私刑杀害。
    单从最近两、三年来的这些罪例，就可看到美帝国主义者在国内疯狂虐杀黑人，蹂躏黑人的基本人权和自由的狰狞面目。这些事实对于美国的“人道主义者”的装扮，正是绝大的讽刺。　（新华社）（附图片）
