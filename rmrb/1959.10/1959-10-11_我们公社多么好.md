　　How Good Our Commune Is
　　Yan Guangzhi, First Secretary of the Liudu People's Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
　　Crossing the Honghuatan River, you arrive at the Liudu People's Commune in Zhengan County, Guizhou. Although this is a high and cold mountainous area, the mountains are covered with lush green red grass, patches of autumn buckwheat and potatoes, green vegetables, and the heavy, golden rice, all growing so luxuriantly!

　　On a clear day, the rice-rich dam at Lotus Pond Temple was even more lively than a festival. Around the dam, posters were plastered with slogans such as "You only see the difference after planting rice in the spring, and you compare high and low when harvesting in the autumn" and "Every field is a place to use your talents, and every job requires creating miracles," with red flags fluttering all over the slopes. As soon as the rooster crowed, the commune members arrived early. The Liudu Commune was about to hold a live competition for quick harvesting and threshing here.

　　The competition was organized with one management district as a combat unit, competing for speed and careful harvesting and threshing.

　　After Wang Xiaozhang was selected as the player to represent the Hedu Management District in the competition, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. Before dawn, he ran to find the partners who were participating in the competition: "What do we do? I heard that Wang Shao Xuan, who threshes five and a half loads a day in Shiping District, is coming to participate. The opponent is tough!" "Don't be afraid of being tough. As long as we are all united, steady and sure, we can guarantee to win the red flag!"

　　When the competition started, the players in the dam were surrounding their own battle zones, all eager to try, tightening their belts. With a whistle, dozens of sickles were lined up and danced, cutting, beating, and the sounds of slapping and patting shook the fields. In less than a half-day, bunches of straight rice stalks turned into piles of grain mountains. After a five-hour battle, the five players from the Hedu Management District led with an average harvest of 810 jin per person, and won the big red flag.

　　At noon, everyone had gone to rest, and only Uncle Fucheng and I were still sitting under the big cedar tree chatting. Uncle Fucheng smoked his pipe, looked at the dazzling golden rice on the dam, and praised it repeatedly: "I am sixty-eight years old and have been doing farm work all my life, but I have never seen such good crops as this year! That big field at the door, in the best year in the past, only yielded thirty-two loads (3,200 jin); this year, at least it will definitely yield 8,000 jin. This year is really strange, even the heavens are convinced!" I smiled and asked him what was so strange about it. The old man said: "If it wasn't strange, look, this year the wind and rain were not right, there was no rain for sixty or seventy days, and no piece of land in the commune was not planted, no piece of land did not grow well, and no piece of land did not have a good harvest. In the year of Gengzi, in this place, there was no rain for twenty-three days, and there was no way to survive. Everyone fled, ran away, and wives and children were scattered, and sons and daughters were sold." The old man was sold to the bully Wang Dading that year and worked as a long-term worker for forty or fifty years. Speaking of this, the old man took a long breath. If it weren't for the people's commune, everyone would be united, and it would be impossible to survive such a big disaster year! The old man spoke endlessly, becoming more and more happy.

　　The autumn grain was harvested. A wave of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain was set off. On the small roads for transporting grain, songs like "The red sun rises from the mountains, illuminating the hearts of ten thousand people, the roads of the commune are good, and this year there is a good harvest" echoed throughout the valleys.

　　After the news that the Shangguan Management District had overfulfilled its warehouse entry task spread, people in other management districts became very anxious. The production team leaders of Shiping and Hedu management districts ran to Shangguan to negotiate: "If we can't beat you in the next five days, we will set off firecrackers and send you a newly made red flag, no questions asked." "You don't agree to this! Let's compete." "What if you lose!" The Shangguan branch secretary thought for a while and said: "Take away the commune's mobile red flag and send you another red flag."

　　On the rugged and uneven trails, commune members transporting grain back and forth were constantly flowing, and songs and laughter flew everywhere. The commune members of the Liudu Management District playfully sang to the Shangguan commune members: "Don't be afraid of your great enthusiasm, we will take the red flag in five days; if the red flag is gone, see what you will do." The commune members of the Shangguan Management District replied: "We will make it difficult for you to chase, difficult for you to catch up, and make your feet lame and your legs soft." Everyone would be deeply moved by the spirit of patriotism and love for the commune of the vast number of commune members.

　　In this golden season of autumn, the scene is full of prosperity. How good our people's commune is!

### 我们公社多么好

　　我们公社多么好
　　中共流渡人民公社委员会第一书记　严光志
    转过红花滩大河，就到了我们贵州正安县的流渡人民公社。虽然这里是地处高寒的山区，但是那满山遍野绿沉沉的红茹，成片的秋荞、洋芋，青青的蔬菜，和那沉甸甸的金黄稻谷，都长得多么茂盛啊！
    一个晴朗的日子，在莲池寺的水稻丰产坝上，真比过节还闹热。坝子四周张贴着“春来插秧才见高下，秋收打谷又比高低”、“丘丘田野都是用武之地，样样活路都要创造奇迹”的标语，红旗满坡飘扬。鸡刚报晓，社员就早早地来到了。流渡公社正要在这里举行快收快打的现场比武大会。
    比武大会以一个管理区为一个参战单位，比多快，比细打细收。
    王孝章当选为河渡管理区参加比武大会的选手后，兴奋得一晚上都没有睡着，天不亮，他就跑去把参加赛会的几个伙伴找到了：“怎么办？听说市平区是一天打五挑半的王少宣来参战哩，对手可硬哩！”“硬也不怕，只要我们大家心齐，稳扎稳打，包管红旗拿过来！”
    赛会开始，坝场中的选手都围着自己的战区，一个个摩拳擦掌，扎腰束带。一声哨子响，几十把镰刀一字排开飞舞起来，割的割，挞的挞，察察拍拍的声响震遍四野。不到一晌的时间，一把把的直秆的稻谷，就变成了一堆堆的粮山。一场战斗，搞了五个小时，最后还是河渡管理区的五个选手，以每人平均收打八百一十斤领先，扛得了大红旗。
    日当中午，大伙已经休息去了，只有辅成大爷和我还坐在大杉树下闲扯。辅成大爷吸着烟，看着坝上耀眼的金黄色的稻谷，连声的赞叹着：“我是六十八岁的人哪，干了这一辈子的农活，可没有见过今年这样好的庄稼呀！当门那丘大田，过去最好的一年也只打过三十二挑（三千二百斤）；今年啦，少说点也要稳打它八千斤。今年哪，真奇，天都服了！”我笑着问他怎么奇法。大爷说：“不奇，你看，今年风不调，雨不顺，六七十天没下过雨，公社那块地没有种上，那块地没有长好，那一片没有丰收。庚子那年，我们这个地方，二十三天没有下过雨，就没有办法了。大伙逃的逃，跑的跑，搞得妻离子散，卖儿卖女。”大爷就是那年被卖给恶霸王大定当了四五十年的长工的。说到这，大爷长长的吁了一口气，要不是人民公社，大家心齐，今年这么大的灾年是过不去的呀！大爷滔滔不绝的说着，愈说愈高兴。
    秋粮丰收了。送公粮卖余粮的浪潮掀了起来。在运粮的小道上，“红日出山岭，照亮万人心，公社道路好，今年好收成”的歌声响遍山谷。
    上关管理区，超额完成了入仓任务的消息传出后，其它管理区的人着急得很。市平、河渡几个管理区的生产队长，跑到上关去交涉：“要是后五天比不过你，放鞭炮新打一首红旗送你没二话说。”“这还不同意呀！比就比。”“要是你输了呢！”上关支书想了一下说：“把公社的流动红旗拿走，再给你们送一面红旗。”
    在崎岖不平的小道上，来往运粮的社员川流不息，歌声笑声四处飞扬。流渡管理区的社员调皮地对着上关的社员们唱道：“不怕你的干劲大，五天就把红旗拿；要是红旗不见了，看你咋个办才好”。上关管理区的社员回答：“管叫你追也难追，赶也难赶，攒得你脚跛腿软。”广大社员那种爱国爱社的精神，谁人见了也会万分感动。
    在这秋高气爽的黄金季节，满眼繁荣景象。我们的人民公社多么好啊！
