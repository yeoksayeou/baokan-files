Comrade Mao Zedong, dear! Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear Comrade Zhu De! Dear Comrades and Friends!

First of all, please allow me to thank Comrade Zhou Enlai for the warm words he has spoken about the Soviet Union and our Soviet Communist Party. Thank you, dear comrades, for your hospitality.

Please allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, and to all the brotherly Chinese people, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is not only your grand and joyful festival, but also a grand and joyful festival for all the friends of your great country.

This year, 1959, is filled with significant, what we usually call, "five-and-ten" anniversaries. This year, the people of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the establishment of their people's democratic regimes. Our German friends will also celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic in just over a week.

We are very honored to be able to celebrate the glorious victory of the Chinese people together with you in Beijing, a victory that has opened a new era in Chinese history. Every such major festival is a historic milestone on the road of rapid development of socialism and communism.

Ten years ago, after the Chinese people seized power, the whole world saw that the Chinese revolution was an event of great historical significance. Whether they were friends or enemies of the Chinese people, they all understood that the victory of the people's revolution in a country with a population of more than 600 million had brought about a major shift in the balance of power on the world stage in favor of socialism. The victory of this revolution further strengthened the forces of national liberation movements around the world.

The victory of the Chinese revolution is yet another victory for the vibrant revolutionary and transformative power of Marxism-Leninism.

The enemies of the People's China were crushed in open battle, but they consoled themselves with the hope that the Chinese people would not be able to overcome the countless difficulties and obstacles on their road forward. We are loyal friends of the People's China, and we know from our own experience that building socialism in such a vast and formerly backward country will involve considerable difficulties. But we also see how much revolutionary enthusiasm the victory of the people's revolution has aroused, and what infinite strength the Chinese people have demonstrated. All honest people are convinced that the Chinese people, who have taken their destiny into their own hands, are capable of defending their homeland and building a new socialist system.

Based on the experience of our people, we know that as long as the working people hold power in their own hands, and as long as there is the strong leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party that knows how to unite the people and lead them to where they should go, there is no force that can stop the people's progress.

The achievements made by the Chinese people are worth talking about in detail, but it is impossible to do so in a short speech. After the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, the Chinese people's revolution is the most outstanding event in world history.

The hardworking and brave Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party have shown that once the people are in power, they can do anything. Today, many countries have shaken off their colonial dependence. The people of these countries have inherited backward economies, and they are looking for ways to lift their countries out of backwardness and onto the broad road of independent development and economic and cultural prosperity. There are two paths before them: the path of capitalist development and the path of socialist development.

The enemies of communism, in a vain attempt to salvage the dying capitalist system, are fond of propagating that private enterprise seems to be able to function better and produce better results. However, a simple comparison of the development speed of countries that have taken the capitalist road with the development speed of socialist countries can convincingly show under which system, socialism or capitalism, the people can more fully unleash their creativity. There is no need for too much explanation here. Practical life proves the great superiority of socialism. Now, the vigorous development of socialist countries is irresistible, and such development has frightened the leaders of capitalism. They admit that the example of the great People's China's victorious progress in the development of industry, agriculture, and culture is exerting a tremendous influence on Asian and African countries. Seeing the victorious advance of the People's China, the people of other countries are eager to learn and hope to achieve the same great achievements, but the enemies of socialism are panic-stricken and worried about the fate of capitalism.

Now, everyone recognizes the achievements made by the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. The people of Asia and Africa see what path and what system should be taken to truly unleash the talents and creativity of the people, and to allow the people to fully and completely display their immense creative power.

In a speech I gave at the industrial center of Pittsburgh in the United States, I said that we challenge capitalist countries to a peaceful competition. I said to the American audience that as honest opponents, we can confidently tell you in advance: watch, we will inevitably surpass you. Why do we have such confidence? Because we are on the right path. We are riding on the young and vigorous horse of socialism, while you are riding on the old horse of capitalism. This horse is still carrying you, but it is already a wounded and lame horse, so the rider must be careful, otherwise he will fall off. But our socialist horse is like a dragon and tiger, full of vitality. Capitalism, which arose after feudalism, once rode a young horse and left feudalism far behind. Similarly, socialism and communism, born in the new era, will certainly leave capitalism far behind and will certainly replace capitalism on the stage of history.

Dear friends, many more examples can be given of the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in various aspects of socialist construction. However, my friends, your achievements are best spoken of by you, not by me, a guest to the People's China, because these achievements have been achieved through your hard work, and you have the right to be proud of the fruits of your labor. And we, as your friends and guests, sincerely rejoice in your outstanding achievements and victories.

China is an ancient and populous country, which everyone has known for a long time. But it is only in the last ten years that the people of the world have truly learned that the Chinese people have such a tremendous amount of power in them. The struggle for freedom, for national independence, and for the construction of socialism has made it possible for the Chinese people to tap into all their spiritual wealth. The labor of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, like countless streams converging into a vast river, has created a vast ocean of people's creativity.

Colonialists once tried to portray Orientals as dull and lazy people, saying that they were incapable of engaging in active creation. Now it can be seen very clearly how shameless this slander is. These words of the colonialists were merely to justify their colonialist plunder and robbery, and merely to boast about the superiority of the so-called "vibrant Western civilization." The reality of the People's China and other Eastern countries has thoroughly shattered this nonsense.

Comrades! The achievements made by the Chinese people make us all proud. What makes us especially happy is that these achievements have been made under the leadership of the fraternal Chinese Communist Party, and under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great son of the Chinese people. The historical merit of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the fact that, under the guidance of the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, it has mobilized hundreds of millions of workers and peasants to rise up and fight for socialism. The Chinese people are fortunate to have such a fighting Communist Party, tempered in struggle.

Dear friends!

Today, on this festival, I am reminded of the tenth anniversary of the Great Socialist October Revolution. At that time, in 1927, the Soviet Union were the only country building socialism. At that time, we had much more difficulties. Our country was then in the encirclement of capitalism. Capitalism had an absolute advantage in material resources. Now it is another matter. Now, the times are different, and we have changed as well.

Here, at the reception of our gracious hosts, representatives from many countries are gathered. It is pleasant to realize that the Chinese people have many loyal friends, who, like China, have embarked on the road of socialist construction. And every friend of China also has as many friends as China. China's friends are also friends of every socialist country that has sent representatives here to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Now, there is a large family of socialist countries with nearly one billion people.

The new world system is moving forward with confidence, developing at a very rapid pace, thriving like new plants in the spring. The new socialist world is not afraid of any storms or disasters, just as deeply rooted trees are not afraid of wind and drought. The socialist camp has become an indestructible force, and it is now playing a decisive role in the fate of mankind. By the way, socialist countries have already sent their marks of greeting to the moon, and the moon has warmly embraced them.

It should be known that the socialist system is actually still very young, and the gigantic power it contains has only just begun to truly manifest itself. Socialist countries have all the necessary conditions to catch up with and surpass capitalist countries in terms of the development of productive forces and in terms of total product output and per capita product output.

The people of our countries will live better year by year, they will amaze the world with many achievements, and they will undoubtedly win in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism. At that time, hundreds of millions more people in capitalist countries will believe that socialism and communism are the best life, and thus take our path. Under the socialist system, they will not only be able to obtain material welfare, but also true freedom and the wealth of spiritual life, and peace for themselves and their descendants.

We should and will defeat capitalist countries in peaceful competition. Our confidence is not only based on our wishes. This confidence has been confirmed by practical life, by the experience of building socialism in a series of countries in Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism is a clear example, an open book, which tells how our people, over a period of forty-two years, have transformed our country into the second strongest economic power in the world, and in these forty-two years, nearly twenty years have been spent on the wars we were forced to fight and the post-war economic recovery work.

Now, we have a vast and populous socialist camp, which includes many countries in Europe and Asia. At this time, of course, we have even greater possibilities to advance rapidly along the road of socialist and communist construction. Every new achievement of socialist countries clearly proves the superiority of the socialist system. Even those who are still afraid of communism due to the influence of capitalist propaganda will finally understand the noble and humanitarian ideals of socialism.

Comrades! Socialism brings peace to people—this is the greatest happiness. The stronger the socialist camp, the more likely it is to effectively defend the cause of world peace. Now the strength of socialism is already very strong, so there is a practical possibility of eliminating war as a means of resolving international disputes.

Now, the leaders of some capitalist countries have begun to show a certain tendency to understand the established situation in the world with a realistic attitude.

I have just returned from the United States. During my talks with President Eisenhower, I had the impression that the American president, who has the support of many people, understands that it is necessary to ease international tensions.

The words "peaceful coexistence" may not be spoken happily by every bourgeois person, but they cannot deny that there are two systems, socialist and capitalist, in the world. The spirit of recognizing this point ran through all the talks, and the President and others repeatedly mentioned this point. Therefore, we on this side should also do our best to eliminate war as a means of resolving disputes, and use negotiations to resolve disputes.

The national leaders of capitalist countries cannot but face the decisive modern factor of the powerful socialist world camp. There is only one way to maintain peace, and that is the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. Now the question is this: either peaceful coexistence, or war and devastating consequences. Now, the balance of power between socialism and capitalism has already favored socialism. Whoever continues to pursue the "cold war policy" is doomed to destruction. The advocates of the "cold war" are pushing the world towards a new world war, but those who start the war will be the first to be burned to death in the flames of war.

As early as the earliest years of the Soviet regime, the great Lenin determined that the general line of our foreign policy was the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. For a long time, Western countries refused this truly humanitarian principle. Nevertheless, the principle of peaceful coexistence is deeply rooted in the hearts of the vast majority of people.

More and more leaders in many capitalist countries have to consider reality and re-establish international relations. Therefore, in our century, it is impossible to successfully resolve the relationship between the two systems except on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence. There is no other way.

We are deeply convinced that the peaceful diplomacy of socialist countries, which defends world peace, will continue to win new victories. To achieve this goal, a lot of effort must be made. However, this noble goal is worth fighting for with all our strength.

Comrades, socialist countries have made great achievements in developing their economies, thereby creating a solid potential on which they can rely to continue to advance victoriously. They have all kinds of means to deal with the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors, if the imperialist aggressors dare to attempt to pull us away from the path of socialism and return us to capitalism by interfering in the internal affairs of our countries. Such an era is gone forever.

However, we should have a realistic view and a correct understanding of the current situation. Of course, this by no means means that since we are so strong, we should use force to test the stability of the capitalist system. This is incorrect, because the people will not understand and will never support those who want to do so. We have always opposed aggressive wars. Marxists have only recognized liberation and just wars in the past and now, while aggressive and imperialist wars have always been condemned. This is one of the characteristics of Marxist-Leninist theory.

Socialist countries oppose war and advocate peaceful coexistence, not because capitalism is still strong. No, we don't need war at all. Even such a noble and progressive system as socialism cannot be forced on people with force if they do not want it. Therefore, socialist countries, which consistently pursue a policy of peace, focus on peaceful construction, and use the exemplary power of socialist construction to inspire people's hearts and guide them to follow their lead. As for when a country takes the path of socialism, this is up to the people themselves to decide, and this matter is the most sacred to us.

Comrades! Our people have embarked on a broad and bright road, and they are full of infinite energy. For the billion people who have already cast off the shackles of capitalist enslavement, there is no task that they cannot accomplish. We are moving towards our sacred goal, deeply convinced of the justice of our common cause, and closely united as a unified team. This unity, illuminated by the never-extinguishing light of Marxism-Leninism, is our great achievement, and we will protect this achievement as we protect the apple of our eye.

The fraternal alliance of socialist countries, the solidarity of proletarian internationalism, the unity of the world communist movement and the workers' movement—this is the indestructible foundation on which we will achieve victory in the struggle for communism in the future.

I propose a toast:

To the great Chinese people,

To the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong,

To the Government of the People's Republic of China,

To the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people,

To the unity of the socialist camp,

To peace and friendship among the people of all countries!

Dear comrades and friends, to your health!

### 在我国国庆宴会上  赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话

第5版()
专栏：

    在我国国庆宴会上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话亲爱的毛泽东同志！亲爱的刘少奇同志！亲爱的朱德同志！亲爱的周恩来同志！敬爱的同志们，朋友们！
    首先请允许我感谢周恩来同志对苏联、对我们苏联共产党所说的热情的言词。亲爱的同志们，感谢你们对我们的款待。
    请允许我向你们，向全体兄弟的中国人民衷心地祝贺中华人民共和国成立十周年。这不仅是你们的盛大的欢乐节日，而且也是你们伟大国家的所有朋友们的盛大欢乐节日。
    今年，1959年，充满了意义重大的、像我们通常所说的“逢五逢十的”节庆。今年，波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚的人民都在庆祝人民民主政权建立的十五周年，我们的德国朋友，再过一个星期也要庆祝德意志民主共和国成立的十周年。
    我们能够和你们一起，在欢度节日的北京共同庆祝中国人民光荣的、揭开了中国历史的新时代的胜利，感到非常荣幸。每一个这样的重大的节日，都是社会主义和共产主义飞速发展道路上的具有历史意义的里程碑。
    十年前，在中国人民取得了政权以后，全世界都看到，中国的革命是一个具有巨大历史意义的事件。不论是中国人民的朋友还是敌人都了解到，一个拥有六亿多人口的国家的人民革命的胜利，使世界舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的重大变化。这次革命的胜利进一步加强了全世界民族解放运动的力量。
    中国革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义思想生气蓬勃的革命改造力量的又一次胜利。
    人民中国的敌人在公开的战斗中被粉碎了，但是他们却用一种希望来安慰自己，希望中国人民不能克服自己前进道路上的无数困难和障碍。我们是人民中国的忠实朋友，我们根据自己的经验清楚地知道，在一个如此巨大的、过去落后的国家中建设社会主义，是会有不小的困难的。但是我们同时也看到，人民革命的胜利唤起了多么巨大的革命热情，中国人民显示出怎样无穷的力量。一切正直的人都深信，掌握了自己命运的中国人民，是能够捍卫自己的家园并建立起社会主义新制度的。
    根据我国人民的经验，我们知道，只要劳动人民把政权掌握在自己手里，只要有知道怎样团结人民、知道把人民领向何处的马克思列宁主义政党的坚强领导，就没有任何力量能够阻挡人民的前进。
    中国人民取得的成就很值得详细地谈一谈，但是在一次简短的发言里是办不到的。在开辟了人类历史的新时代的伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，中国的人民革命是世界历史上最杰出的事件。
    共产党领导下的勤劳勇敢的中国人民显示，人民一旦掌握了政权，就无所不能。今天，许多国家已经摆脱了殖民地的依赖地位。这些国家的人民所继承的是落后的经济，他们正在寻找怎样使自己的国家摆脱落后状态，走上独立发展和经济文化欣欣向荣的广阔道路。摆在他们面前的有两条道路，一条是资本主义的发展道路，另一条是社会主义的发展道路。
    共产主义的敌人妄想挽救日暮途穷的资本主义制度，他们总喜欢宣扬，说什么私人企业似乎能够更好地发挥作用，产生更好的效果。但是，只要把那些走资本主义道路的国家的发展速度同社会主义国家的发展速度简单地对比一下，就可以令人信服地表明，究竟在什么制度下，是在社会主义制度下还是在资本主义制度下，人民能够更充分地发挥自己的创造力。在这里甚至不需要作过多的说明。实际生活就证明了社会主义的伟大优越性。现在，社会主义国家的蓬勃发展是不可阻挡的，这样的发展使得资本主义的头目们惊慌失措。他们承认，伟大的人民中国在发展工业、农业和文化方面胜利前进的例子正在给予亚非各国以巨大的影响。看到人民中国的胜利前进，其他国家的人民都很想学习，希望取得同样巨大的成就，但是，社会主义的敌人却恐慌万状，为资本主义的命运担忧。
    现在，大家都公认中国人民和中国共产党所取得的成就。亚非各国人民看到，应当走什么道路和采取什么制度才能真正地发挥出人民的才能和创造力，才能让人民全面地和充分地显示他们强大无比的创造力量。
    我在美国大工业中心匹兹堡的一次讲话中说过，我们向资本主义国家挑战，进行和平竞赛。我向美国听众说，我们作为诚实的对手，我们可以满怀信心地预先告诉你们：看着吧，我们必然会胜过你们。为什么我们有这样的信心呢？因为我们是站在正确的道路上了。我们是骑在年轻的、生气勃勃的社会主义的骏马上，而你们是骑在资本主义的老马上。这匹马还驮着你们走，但是这已经是摔伤的、瘸腿的马，所以骑马的人必须提心吊胆，否则就要摔下。可是我们社会主义这匹马，却像生龙活虎，充满活力。在封建主义之后兴起的资本主义，曾经骑上一匹年轻的马，把封建主义远远地抛在后面。同样，在新时代诞生的社会主义、共产主义，也一定会把资本主义远远地抛在后面，也一定会取代资本主义在历史舞台上的地位。
    亲爱的朋友们，关于中国人民在社会主义建设各个方面的辉煌成就，还可以举出很多例子。但是，我的朋友，你们的成就最好由你们来谈，而不是由我这个到人民中国来作客的人来谈，因为这些成就都是你们辛辛苦苦取得的，你们是有权为自己的劳动成果感到自豪的。而我们，作为你们的朋友和客人，衷心地为你们杰出的成就和胜利高兴。
    中国是一个古老的、人口很多的国家，这是大家早就知道的。但是中国人民身上蕴蓄着那样巨大的力量，这是世界各国人民直到最近十年才真正知道。为自由、为民族独立、为建设社会主义而进行的斗争，使中国人民有可能发掘自己的全部精神财富。千百万工人、农民、知识分子的劳动，像无数小溪汇成浩浩大江那样，造成了人民创造力的大海洋。
    殖民主义者曾经企图把东方人说成是迟钝怠惰的人，说他们不能从事积极的创造。现在可以特别清楚地看到，这是多么无耻的诽谤。殖民主义者的这些话，不过是为他们的殖民主义掠夺和抢劫行为辩护，不过是想吹嘘所谓“生动活泼的西方文明”的优越性。人民中国和其他一些东方国家的现实，已经彻底粉碎了这种谰言。
    同志们！中国人民取得的成就，使我们大家都感到骄傲。尤其使我们高兴的是，这些成就是在兄弟的中国共产党的领导下，在以中国人民伟大的儿子毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下取得的。中国共产党的历史功绩就在于，它在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的指导下，发动亿万工农群众起来为社会主义而斗争。中国人民有这样一个战斗的、在斗争中久经锻炼的共产党，这是中国人民的幸福。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    今天在这个节日里，使我想起了伟大的十月社会主义革命的十周年。那时，在1927年，苏联是唯一建设社会主义的国家。当时我们要困难得多。我们的国家当时处在资本主义的包围中。资本主义在物质资料方面占绝对的优势。现在是另外一回事了。现在，时代不一样了，我们也变了样了。
    在这里，在我们殷勤的主人的招待会上，聚集着许多国家的代表。令人愉快地意识到，中国人民有许多忠实的朋友，这些朋友也像中国一样走上了社会主义建设的道路。而中国的每一个朋友也有同中国一样多的朋友。中国的朋友也是每一个派代表在这里参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆典的社会主义国家的朋友。现在，存在着一个拥有将近十亿人口的社会主义国家的大家庭。
    新的世界体系满怀信心地向前迈进，以极快的速度向前发展，像春天的新生植物那样欣欣向荣。新的社会主义世界不惧怕任何风暴和灾难，有如深深扎根的大树不惧怕风吹和干旱一样。社会主义阵营已成为一种不可摧毁的力量，它现在对人类命运起着决定性的影响。顺便说一说，社会主义国家已经把自己的问候的标记送上了月球，而月球也盛情地把它抱在怀里。
    要知道，社会主义制度实际上还很年轻，它所蕴藏的巨人般的力量还只是刚刚开始真正显现出来而已。社会主义国家具有一切必要的条件，来在生产力的发展方面和在产品总产量以及按人口计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过资本主义国家。
    我们各国人民将一年比一年生活得更好，他们将以许许多多的成就使世界震惊，而且无疑将在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利。那时，资本主义国家中又将有亿万人会相信社会主义和共产主义是最美好的生活，因而走我们的道路。他们在社会主义制度下将不仅能获得物质福利，而且能获得真正的自由和精神生活的财富，获得他们自己和后代的和平。
    我们应该在和平竞赛中战胜并且一定会战胜资本主义国家。我们的信心不仅仅基于我们的愿望。这种信心已经为实际生活、为欧洲和亚洲一系列国家建设社会主义的经验所证实。苏联建设社会主义的经验是一个明显的范例，是一本打开了的书，这本书叙述了我国人民如何在四十二年期间把我国变成一个经济实力居世界第二位的国家，而在这四十二年中，有将近二十年的时间是花在我们被迫进行的战争上和战后的经济恢复工作上的。
    现在，我们有一个幅员辽阔、人口众多的社会主义阵营，它包括欧洲和亚洲的许多国家，在这个时候，当然，我们就更有无限巨大的可能性沿着社会主义和共产主义建设的道路迅速前进。社会主义国家每一个新的成就都明显地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。甚至那些由于受到资本主义宣传的影响而仍然害怕共产主义的人，也终于会明白社会主义的崇高的、人道主义的理想。
    同志们！社会主义给人们带来了和平——这是最大的幸福。社会主义阵营的力量越壮大，它就越有可能有效地捍卫世界和平事业。现在社会主义的力量已经十分强大，因此，有了排除以战争作为解决国际争端的手段的实际可能性。
    现在，某些资本主义国家政府的领导人，开始表现了一定的以现实主义态度来了解世界上的既成形势的倾向。
    我刚从美国回来，在我同艾森豪威尔总统交谈的时候，我有了这样的印象，得到不少人支持的美国总统是明白必须缓和国际紧张局势的。
    “和平共处”这几个字，也许不是每一个资产阶级人士都能痛快地说出口的，但是他们不能否认，世界上存在着社会主义和资本主义两个体系。历次谈话都贯穿着承认这一点的精神，总统和其他人士都一再地谈到这一点。因此，我们这一方面也应该尽力排除作为解决争端的手段的战争，而用谈判来解决争端。
    资本主义国家的国家领导人不能不正视强大的社会主义世界阵营这样一个有决定意义的现代因素。维护和平只有一条道路，这就是不同社会制度的国家和平共处。现在问题是这样：或者和平共处，或者进行战争而遭到毁灭性的后果。现在，社会主义和资本主义的力量对比已经有利于社会主义，谁要继续奉行“冷战政策”，谁就是自取灭亡。“冷战”的拥护者正把世界推向新的世界大战，可是在战火中烧死的首先将是发动战争的人。
    还在苏维埃政权的最初年代里，伟大的列宁就确定了我们外交政策的总路线是社会制度不同的国家和平共处的方针。西方国家长期以来拒绝这种真正人道的原则。虽然如此，和平共处的原则深深打入绝大多数人的心。
    许多资本主义国家的领导人士越来越不得不考虑现实，从新建立国际关系，因此，在我们的世纪里，除了根据和平共处的原则，是无法成功地解决两个制度之间的关系问题的。别的道路是没有的。
    我们深信，捍卫着世界和平的社会主义国家的和平外交政策将继续不断取得新的胜利。要达到这个目的，必须作不少的努力。但是，这个崇高的目标是值得不遗余力地为它奋斗的。
    同志们，社会主义国家在发展自己的经济方面取得了巨大的成就，从而创造了雄厚的潜力，它们可以依靠这种潜力不断胜利地前进。它们拥有种种手段，对付帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，如果帝国主义侵略者竟敢企图通过干涉我们这些国家的内政来把我们从社会主义的道路上拉开，并使我们回到资本主义的话。这样的时代是一去不复返了。
    但是，我们应当对当前局势有现实的看法和正确的理解。这当然绝不是说，既然我们这么强大，就应该用武力去试试资本主义制度的稳固性。这是不正确的，因为人民将不会理解，也绝不会支持那些想这么干的人。我们一向反对侵略战争。马克思主义者过去和现在只承认解放的、正义的战争，而侵略的、帝国主义的战争则始终受到谴责。这是马克思列宁主义理论的特点之一。
    社会主义国家反对战争，主张和平共处，这完全不是因为资本主义还强大。不是的，我们根本不需要战争。甚至像社会主义这样一种崇高而进步的制度，如果人民不要它，也不能用武力强迫他们接受。因此，一贯执行和平政策的社会主义国家集中精力来进行和平建设，用社会主义建设的示范力量鼓舞人们的心，引导他们跟着自己走。至于哪一个国家什么时候走上社会主义道路的问题，这要由人民自己来决定，这件事对我们是最最神圣的。
    同志们！我们的人民走上了广阔和光明的大道，他们充满着无穷的精力。对于已经抛弃资本主义奴役枷锁的十亿人民来说，没有什么任务是他们所不能胜任的。我们走向自己神圣的目标，深信我们共同事业的正义性，紧密地团结成为一支统一的队伍。在马克思列宁主义永不熄灭的光辉照耀下的这种团结是我们的伟大成果，我们将像保护眼珠一样地保护这个成果。
    社会主义国家的兄弟同盟、无产阶级的国际主义的团结、世界共产主义运动和工人运动的统一——这是我们在为共产主义而进行的斗争中将来取得胜利的不可摧毁的基础。
    我建议，为伟大的中国人民，
    为中国共产党和它的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会，
    为中华人民共和国政府，
    为苏中两国人民永恒的和牢不可破的友谊，
    为社会主义阵营各国的团结，
    为和平和世界各国人民的友谊，干杯！
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，为你们的健康干杯！
