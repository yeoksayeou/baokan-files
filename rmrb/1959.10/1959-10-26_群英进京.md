The morning sun shines on the sea, like a beauty gazing into a mirror, her face flushed with excitement… Why so happy? Ah, to send sea heroes to Beijing.

Down the slope, chimneys rise like reed pipes, up the slope, terraced fields send forth the sound of water – like laughter, silver bells trembling on shoulders… What auspicious day has come to the high cold mountains? No, it is to send Miao heroes to Beijing.

The Kangzang Highway stretches a thousand miles, like a vast silk banner unfurled, Sejila bows and smiles, asking: To whom is the Hada being presented? Ah, to send Tibetan heroes to Beijing.

Millions of colorful pearls roll on an emerald plate – the grasslands are filled with joyous horses and people. What festival is approaching? No, it is to send northern heroes to Beijing.

Turtle Mountain stretches out its arms, grooming the Yangtze River’s silver mane; Mount Luojia pushes open the window and asks with a smile: Which heroes is the Yangtze River sending? Ah, to send southern heroes to Beijing.

The chimneys wave their headscarves, attracting the admiring gazes of the heroes; the smelting furnace presents a heart of red-hot blood, asking the heroes what gifts they are taking with them on this trip? Taking your steel-like oath to Beijing.

The mountains cannot hide the eyes of those seeing them off, and grain mountains lift the communes to the clouds; the fields reveal newly tilled smiling faces, calling upon the heroes to open the garments of great industry: Please tuck these baby-like new ears of grain into your pockets as you go to Beijing…

To Beijing, to Beijing! The Great Leap Forward's warhorses gallop with the wind, carrying the country's heroes from all walks of life, galloping along the general line's avenue, rushing towards the peak, rushing towards Beijing!

With hearts of utter devotion to the motherland, to report on new victories; to see Chairman Mao's smile, to hear the Party's voice – to kiss the mother's heart!

The mother's heart is the engine of the socialist train, it pulls six hundred million heroes, racing towards newer peaks, racing towards a more beautiful future!

    群英进京
    吴中帡朝阳映着大海，像美人临着晓镜，兴奋得满面绯红……为什么这般高兴？呵，要送海上英雄进京。坡下扬起籚笙似的烟囱，坡上梯田递送水声——像欢笑颤动肩上银铃……高寒山又过啥吉日良辰？不，是送苗家英雄进京。康藏公路一泻千里，像抖开万丈绸巾，色霁拉躬身笑问：哈达送与何人？呵，要送藏族英雄进京。千万颗五彩珍珠，在翡翠盘上滚动——草原上人马欢腾。又是什么佳节来临？不，是送北国英雄进京。龟山伸出手臂，理着大江的银鬃；珞珈山推窗笑问：大江要送哪路英雄？呵，要送南方豪杰进京。烟囱挥舞着头上纱巾，吸引着英雄依恋的眼神；炼炉捧出热血红心，问英雄此去带啥礼品？带着你钢的誓言进京。群山遮不住送行的眼睛，粮山把公社托上云层；田野露出新耕的笑脸，唤英雄敞开大工业的衣襟：请揣上我这娃娃似的新穗进京……进京，进京！大跃进的战马四蹄生风，正驮着祖国的各路英雄，沿着总路线的大道飞奔，奔向高峰，奔向北京！用对祖国的赤胆忠心，去汇报新的战功；去看毛主席的笑容，去听党的声音——去吻母亲的心！母亲的心，是社会主义列车的引擎，它牵引着六亿英雄，奔向更新的高峰，奔向更美的前程！
