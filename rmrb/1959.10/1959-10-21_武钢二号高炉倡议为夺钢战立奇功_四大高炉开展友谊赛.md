Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 20th: The entire staff of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace recently proposed to the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace and the Baotou Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace that the four modern, giant blast furnaces in the country (including the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace) should launch a friendship competition, make a final push in the fourth quarter, and jointly strive to complete and exceed the national target of 12 million tons of steel. In their proposal, the staff of the No. 2 Blast Furnace put forward monthly production targets for the fourth quarter: They guarantee that under the condition of using all-natural ore, the daily pig iron production in October will approach the design target, reaching 2,100 tons; in November, it will exceed the design target, reaching 2,250 tons; and in December, with the partial use of sintered ore, it will increase by another 300 tons compared to November. The proposal also stated that the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace should be increased to 1.78 in December, the quality pass rate of pig iron should reach over 95% in the fourth quarter, and the coke consumption per ton of pig iron should be reduced to 0.7 tons in December. The proposal also put forward specific measures to achieve these targets.

Since being put into operation in mid-July this year, the entire staff of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace, under the leadership of the Party, has overcome difficulties such as new equipment and unfamiliar worker skills, overfulfilling the production plan every month. The average daily output in the first ten days of October has increased by 8% compared to September. The workers believe that the four giant blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel are the main force in national ironmaking production, sharing common characteristics. They have all been newly put into production in the past year, and the equipment conditions and operating technologies are not far apart. It is necessary to establish a liaison system, exchange information in the competition, share advanced experience, and jointly unleash production potential to produce more high-quality pig iron for the country. Therefore, they put forward the competition proposal.

    武钢二号高炉倡议为夺钢战立奇功
    四大高炉开展友谊赛
    新华社武汉20日电　武钢二号高炉全体职工最近向鞍钢十号高炉、包钢一号高炉倡议：全国四座现代化的巨型高炉（包括武钢一号高炉）开展友谊竞赛，决战第四季度，为完成和超额完成全国一千二百万吨钢的任务共同奋斗。二号高炉职工在倡议书中提出了第四季度的分月生产指标：他们保证在全部采用天然矿石的条件下，使10月份的生铁日产量接近设计指标，达到两千一百吨；11月份超过设计指标，达到两千两百五十吨；12月份在部分采用烧结矿石的条件下，比11月份再增加三百吨。倡议书中提出要使高炉利用系数在12月份提高到一点七八，生铁质量合格率第四季度达到95％以上，每炼一吨生铁的焦炭消耗量在12月份降低到零点七吨。倡议书中还提出实现这些指标的具体措施。
    武钢二号高炉从今年7月中旬投入生产以来，全体职工在党的领导下，克服了设备新、工人技术不熟练等困难，月月超额完成生产计划，10月上旬的平均日产量又比9月份提高了8％。职工们认为武钢、鞍钢、包钢这四座巨型高炉是全国炼铁生产中的主力军，具有共同特点，都是最近一年来新投入生产的，设备条件和操作技术相差不远，有必要建立联系制度，在竞赛中互通情报，交流先进经验，共同发挥生产潜力，为国家生产更多的优质生铁，因此提出了竞赛倡议。
