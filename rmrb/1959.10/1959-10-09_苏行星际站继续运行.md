Xinhua News Agency, October 8th dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, at 20:00 Moscow time on October 7th, the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket continued operation, located near the sixth star in the constellation Ophiuchus, with a declination of minus eleven degrees and thirty-six minutes, and a right ascension of sixteen hours, thirty-one minutes, and thirty-seven seconds.

    The determination of the operational elements of the automatic interplanetary station, carried out by the adjustment calculation center, shows that the interplanetary station continues to operate strictly according to its predetermined orbit.

    The automatic interplanetary station passed the closest point to the moon, then curved around the moon, flying further and further away from both the Earth and the Moon. As of 20:00 Moscow time on October 7th, the distance of the interplanetary station from the moon was 126,000 kilometers, and the distance from the Earth was 417,000 kilometers.

    During the continued operation, the distance of the automatic interplanetary station from the Earth will become increasingly larger, reaching a maximum distance of 470,000 kilometers on October 10th. Then, at its furthest point, the interplanetary station will begin to approach the Earth. It will pass by the Earth from north to south on October 18th. The shortest distance from the Earth's surface will be about 40,000 kilometers.

    The data obtained by the ground telemetry station when it contacted the automatic interplanetary station on October 6th proved that the scientific measuring instruments, temperature adjustment system, and energy system of the interplanetary station continued to work normally.

    The next time the automatic interplanetary station sends measurement data and operational parameter measurement data to the ground will be between 17:00 and 18:00 Moscow time on October 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, October 7th dispatch: According to TASS reports, Varvarov, Director of the Astronomical Department of the Soviet Voluntary Association for Supporting the Army, Navy, and Air Force, said in an article published in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on the 7th, that the speed of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket was already low as it orbited the Moon. When it started running towards Earth from the farthest point on its orbit from Earth, its speed was only a few hundred kilometers per hour. Therefore, the time it spends near the Moon will account for about one-third of the total flight time.

    Varvarov pointed out that the latest intelligence sent by the interplanetary station shows that it is strictly operating according to its original orbit.

    苏行星际站继续运行
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科时间10月7日二十时，苏联第三个宇宙火箭继续运行，位置在蛇夫座的第六个星附近，赤纬为负十一度三十六分，赤经为十六时三十一分三十七秒。
    调整计算中心对自动行星际站的运行要素进行的测定表明，行星际站继续严格按照预定的轨道运行。
    自动行星际站通过了离月球的最近点，并弯过来绕过月球飞行，离地球和月球越来越远。截至莫斯科时间10月7日二十时，行星际站离月球的距离为十二万六千公里，离地球的距离为四十一万七千公里。
    自动行星际站在继续运行中，离地球的距离将越来越远，10月10日将达到最大距离四十七万公里。然后，行星际站在最远的地方开始接近地球。并在10月18日由北向南从地球旁边通过。离地球表面的最短距离将为四万公里左右。
    地面遥测站在10月6日与自动行星际站联系时获得的资料证明，行星际站的科学测量仪器、温度调整系统和能源系统继续正常工作。
    自动行星际站下次向地面发送测量资料和运行参数测量资料的时间将在莫斯科时间10月8日十七时至十八时。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会天文部主任瓦尔瓦罗夫7日在苏联“共青团真理报”上发表的一篇文章中说，苏联第三个宇宙火箭在绕月球飞行时，速度已经不大了。当它从它轨道上距地球最远的一点上开始向地球运行时，每小时的速度只有几百公里。因此，它在月球附近的时间将约占全部飞行时间的三分之一。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫指出，行星际站发来的最后几次情报说明，它在严格地按照原定的轨道运行。
