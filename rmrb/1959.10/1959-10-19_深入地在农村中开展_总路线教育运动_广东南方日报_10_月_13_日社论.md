Conduct a Thorough General Line Education Movement in Rural Areas
—Southern Daily Editorial, Guangdong, October 13

In Guangdong Province, rural areas, from now until the end of this month or the beginning of next month, will comprehensively and thoroughly carry out a large-scale education movement on the general line of socialist construction. Whether this nationwide ideological education movement can be carried out vigorously and effectively, and whether it can promote the rural grassroots cadres and peasant masses to consciously raise their political awareness and deeply and thoroughly solve ideological problems, is of decisive significance for further implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction, for realizing a new great leap forward this winter and next spring and next year, and for further consolidating the people's communes.

As everyone knows, the current rural situation is extremely good. Since the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee was implemented some time ago, the evil winds and noxious influences in the countryside have been suppressed, and the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants have greatly increased. Production work and various tasks of the people's communes have embarked on a path of healthy development and are developing vigorously. However, we must also soberly see that ideological obstacles still exist on the road to continued great leap forward in the rural areas of the province. Among the rural grassroots cadres, especially the cadres at the production brigade level of the people's communes, many have varying degrees of right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions, and a very small number of them have even become stumbling blocks to the continued leap forward. The ideological situation of the peasant masses should also be analyzed concretely. According to surveys, on the one hand, the poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for 80% of the rural population, as well as some wealthier middle peasants with higher awareness, resolutely support the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes; but on the other hand, a considerable number of them, because they have been affected by evil winds and noxious influences, and also because they have shortcomings in their understanding of objective things, still have some vague views on the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. A portion of wealthier middle peasants with relatively serious capitalist ideas, seeing that some poor and lower-middle peasants also have some ideological problems, believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, and thus use the method of attacking one point without considering the rest, arbitrarily exaggerating some shortcomings in rural work since 1958, and spreading negative thoughts and discontent among the masses. These situations show us that the general line education movement for socialist construction must be carried out on a large scale and resolutely throughout the province, and it is by no means dispensable. Only through such a large-scale, vigorous, and mass-based self-education movement can the rural areas of the province further strengthen the Party's leadership, that is, putting politics in command, under the new historical conditions of socialist construction. Specifically, only through such a movement can the fighting units of the people's communes—the Party organizations of the production brigades and each of its cadres—raise even higher the brilliant banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and lead the masses with full confidence to continue the leap forward; only then can the broad masses consciously dispel various forms of ideological knots, achieve a state of universal well-being, and, on this basis, thoroughly sweep away evil winds and noxious influences; only then can the masses be inspired with greater enthusiasm and promote production work from one upsurge to another. There is no doubt that if these three goals are achieved in this ideological education movement, the work throughout the province will be very active, and a new great leap forward situation this winter and next spring and next year will definitely arrive.

To carry out the general line education movement deeply and thoroughly within a short period of two or thirty days, and to resolutely prevent the phenomenon of going through the motions and doing things simply, it is necessary to adopt correct working methods. First of all, it is necessary to arm the cadres with ideology, strengthen the leadership core, and rectify the Party and League organizations. The purpose of doing so is not only to enable each production brigade to have strong leadership when carrying out the movement, but also to improve and purify the entire grassroots cadre team, so that the Party organization of each production brigade can play a true role as a fighting fortress in future work. To this end, each people's commune should especially strengthen its leadership over those backward brigades in this movement, establish a strong leadership core there, in order to lay a solid foundation for rapidly changing the backward situation in the future. Secondly, the masses must be allowed to fully speak out and fully expose their thoughts, and then adopt the method of recalling, comparing, and accounting to make the broad masses, especially the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, educate themselves first. Only in this way can the goal of raising the majority of the masses be achieved. It is the most important task in the entire movement and must be done with the greatest effort. However, some local leading cadres are currently worried that if the masses are allowed to fully expose their thoughts, it will cause a lot of trouble. This is a manifestation of not believing in the majority of the masses and is therefore completely wrong. Again, on the basis of universally raising the political awareness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, individual wealthier middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas should be selected, and their series of erroneous remarks should be analyzed and criticized. The purpose of doing so is to further educate the broad masses in a vivid and concrete way, and also to educate the wealthy middle peasants who are being criticized. When conducting this analysis and criticism, the method of presenting facts and reasoning should be adopted, that is, the method of persuasion should be adopted, rather than the method of coercion, in order to correctly resolve this internal contradiction between the broad masses and the wealthier middle peasants with capitalist ideas. Some local cadres believe that as long as the erroneous ideas of some wealthy middle peasants are criticized, the entire purpose of the general line education movement can be achieved, and therefore they do not actively guide the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out self-education. This simplification method is not in line with reality and should therefore be corrected and prevented.

To thoroughly solve the ideological problems of the masses, raise the ideological awareness of the broad masses, and thoroughly refute the erroneous remarks of some wealthy middle peasants, the key lies in accounting. Using the method of accounting to recall the past and compare it with today, using the method of accounting to analyze each specific problem, and making concrete answers to specific problems, this is the method of treating problems historically, comprehensively, and specifically, which is the method of Marxism-Leninism. In every ideological education movement since liberation, the peasants of the province have adopted this method, and the result has always been successful in raising their awareness, which repeatedly and vividly illustrates this point. Some comrades in some places are currently worried that the result of accounting will become more and more complicated and will not be able to solve ideological problems. This is a groundless and unnecessary worry. In the ten years since liberation, our Party has led the people to do countless earth-shattering things, especially since 1958, the people of the province have made leaps and bounds in all aspects of their undertakings under the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and have significantly improved their living standards, and it is strange that a Communist Party member or a revolutionary cadre is afraid of calculating these accounts, isn't it? The experience of many pilot communes and pilot teams in the province's general line education movement proves that the more you calculate, the more obvious the achievements become, the happier the masses become, and those who have confused ideas also suddenly understand. For example, the results of accounting in many places show that the hard work of one year did not result in little gain, but a lot of gain, which not only greatly improved the current life, but also completed a large number of basic construction projects, which will play a long-term role; this makes the peasants deeply realize the truth of "hard work for a few years, benefiting for ten thousand years." Some places used the method of accounting to analyze the superiority of the people's communes, so that the masses unanimously recognized that the transition from advanced cooperatives to people's communes was not "doing something unnecessary," but "icing on the cake," and it had to be done. Various places have used the method of accounting to analyze the improvement of living standards, the increase in the consumption of daily necessities, the benefits of the collective economy, the benefits of the supply system component of the commune, the benefits of public canteens and nurseries, etc., which have also solved the ideological problems of a portion of people with unclear understanding. The result of doing so will only make the so-called "complicated" problem become a simple and clear problem, and will only make the masses more firmly support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, isn't it obvious? The experience of the pilot projects shows that when accounting, we must first calculate the accounts of the entire commune and the entire brigade, both the accounts since communization and the accounts of the past ten years, and then every household should calculate the accounts, and everyone should calculate the accounts. For those who have different ideological understandings, we can specifically calculate the accounts for their specific problems, so as to "open a lock with a key." Of course, while affirming the great achievements after accounting, we should also point out the shortcomings in the work, so that the masses can correctly understand the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. In this way, those who attempt to exaggerate the shortcomings by attacking one point will have no market, and the masses will consciously criticize their erroneous remarks.

May all localities immediately strengthen their leadership and conduct the socialist construction general line education movement deeply and thoroughly!

　　深入地在农村中开展  总路线教育运动
　　——广东南方日报10月13日社论
    广东省各地农村，从现在起到本月底或下月初这段时间以内，将要全面地深入地进行一次大规模的社会主义建设总路线教育运动。这个全民性的思想教育运动，能不能够有声有色地进行，能不能够促使农村基层干部和农民群众自觉地提高政治觉悟，又深又透地解决思想问题，对于进一步贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线、对于实现今冬明春和明年的新的大跃进、对于进一步巩固人民公社，都具有决定性的意义。
    大家知道，目前农村形势极为良好。自从前一段时间贯彻了党的八中全会决议的精神以后，农村中的歪风邪气已经被打下去，贫农和下中农的政治积极性和生产积极性大大高涨起来，生产工作和人民公社的各项工作走上了健康发展的道路，正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。但是，也要清醒地看到，在全省农村的继续大跃进的道路上，仍然存在着思想障碍。在农村基层干部特别是人民公社的生产大队一级干部中间，有不少人存在着程度不同的右倾思想和右倾情绪，他们中的极少数人甚至已经成为继续跃进的绊脚石。对于农民群众的思想情况，也应当进行具体的分析。根据调查，一方面，占农村人口80％的贫农和下中农以及一部分觉悟较高的富裕中农，对于社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社，是坚决拥护的；但是，另一方面，他们中间的相当一部分人，因为受到歪风邪气的影响，也因为他们在认识客观事物的时候，存在着片面性的毛病，这就使得他们对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社，仍然存在着某些模糊观点，一部分具有比较严重的资本主义思想的富裕中农，他们看见一部分贫农、下中农也存在着若干思想问题，便认为有机可乘，因而用攻其一点、不及其余的办法，任意夸大1958年以来农村工作中的某些缺点，在群众中散布着消极思想和不满情绪。这些情况向我们说明，社会主义建设总路线教育运动，是一定要在全省范围内大规模地坚决地进行，决不是可有可无的。只有通过这样大规模的声势猛烈的群众性的自我教育运动，才能够使全省农村，在社会主义建设的新的历史条件下，进一步加强党的领导即政治挂帅。具体地说，只有通过这样一个运动，才能够使全省人民公社的战斗单位——生产大队的党组织和它的每一个干部，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，信心百倍地领导群众继续跃进；才能够使广大群众自觉地打消各种不同形式的思想疙瘩，做到人人心情舒畅，并且在这个基础上彻底扫除歪风邪气；才能够使群众鼓起更大干劲，推动生产工作从一个高潮走向另一个高潮。毫无疑问，在这一次思想教育运动中，达到了这三个目的，全省的工作就会十分主动，今冬明春和明年新的大跃进的局面就肯定会到来了。
    要在短短的二、三十天以内，把总路线教育运动搞深搞透，坚决防止可能出现的走过场和简单从事的现象，这就必须采取正确的工作方法。首先，必须武装干部思想，健全领导核心，整顿党团组织。这样做的目的，不仅是为了要使每一个生产大队在开展运动的时候，都有坚强的领导，而且是为了提高和纯洁整个基层干部队伍，使每一个生产大队的党组织都能够在今后的工作中发挥真正的战斗堡垒作用。为此，每一个人民公社，应当在这次运动中特别加强对那些落后大队的领导，在他们那里建立坚强的领导核心，以便为今后迅速改变落后面貌打下牢靠的基础。其次，必须让群众充分鸣放，充分暴露思想，然后采取回忆、对比和算账的办法，使广大群众首先是广大贫农和下中农自己教育自己。只有这样，才能够达到提高大多数群众的目的。它是整个运动中最重要的一项工作，必须用最大的力量把它做好。但是，目前有些地方的领导干部，担心如果让群众充分暴露思想，会引起许多麻烦。这是不相信群众大多数的表现，因而是完全错误的。再次，在普遍地提高了广大贫农和下中农的政治觉悟的基础上，应当选择个别具有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，针对他的一系列错误言论进行分析批判。这样做的目的，是为了使广大群众进一步受到生动和具体的教育，同时也为了使被批判的富裕中农本人得到教育。在进行这种分析批判的时候，应当采取摆事实、讲道理的办法，这就是说，应当采用说服的办法，而不是采用压服的办法，以便正确地解决广大群众同具有资本主义思想的富裕中农之间的这种人民内部矛盾。有些地方的干部，认为只要批判某些富裕中农的错误思想，就可以达到总路线教育运动的全部目的，因而不积极引导广大贫农和下中农进行自我教育的工作。这种简单化的作法是不符合实际的，因而是应当加以纠正和防止的。
    要透彻地解决群众的思想问题，提高广大群众的思想觉悟，彻底批驳某些富裕中农的错误言论，关键在于算账。用算账的办法回忆过去，对比今天，用算账的办法分析每一个具体问题，对具体问题作出具体的回答，这是历史地、全面地、具体地对待问题的方法，也就是马克思列宁主义的方法。全省农民在解放以后的每一次思想教育运动中，都采用了这种方法，结果总是成功地提高了自己的觉悟，这就反复地生动地说明了这一点。目前有些地方的同志担心算账的结果会越算越复杂，越算越不能解决思想问题，这是毫无根据的杞人忧天的想法。解放十年来，我们党领导人民做了无数惊天动地的大事，特别是1958年以来，全省人民在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜下，使各方面的事业有了飞跃的发展，使人民生活更显著地得到改善，而一个共产党员或者一个革命干部，竟然怕算这些账，难道不是很奇怪的吗？全省总路线教育运动的许多试点社、试点队的经验证明，越算账成绩就越明显，群众就越开心，有糊涂思想的人也因而恍然大悟。例如，许多地方算账的结果表明，苦战一年不是所得不多，而是所得很多，不仅已经大大改善了眼前生活，而且还完成了大量基本建设，将长远地起作用；这就使农民深刻地认识到“苦战几年，造福万年”的道理。有的地方用算账的办法，分析了人民公社的优越性，使群众一致认识到，高级社转为人民公社，绝不是“多此一举”，而是“锦上添花”，非办不可。各地用算账的办法，去分析生活水平的提高、日用品消费的增加、集体经济的好处、公社的供给制成分的好处、公共食堂和托儿所的好处等等，也都使一部分认识不清的人的思想问题迎刃而解。这样做的结果，只会使所谓“复杂”的问题变成简单明了的问题，只会使群众更坚决地拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社，不是很明显的吗？试点的经验表明，算账的时候，必须先算全公社、全大队的账，既算公社化以来的账，也算十年以来的账，然后应当家家算账，人人算账。对于那些有不同的思想认识的人，可以针对他们的具体问题专门算账，做到“一把钥匙开一把锁”。当然，在经过算账，肯定了伟大的成绩的同时，也应当指出工作中的缺点，使群众正确理解九个指头和一个指头的关系。这样，那些企图用攻其一点的办法来夸大缺点的人，也就没有市场了，群众就会自觉地批判他们的错误言论了。
    愿各地立即加强领导，把社会主义建设总路线教育运动搞深搞透！
