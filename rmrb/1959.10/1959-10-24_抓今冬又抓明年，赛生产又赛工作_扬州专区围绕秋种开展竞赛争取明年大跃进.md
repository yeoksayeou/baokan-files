Grasp This Winter and Next Year, Compete in Production and Work
Yangzhou Prefecture Launches Competition Centered on Autumn Planting to Strive for a Great Leap Forward Next Year

(Reported by this newspaper) The CPC Yangzhou Prefectural Committee is using revolutionary spirit to carry out autumn planting, prompting various localities to plan next year's production around autumn planting, and comprehensively launching a competition to strive for a great leap forward next year. Currently, Taizhou, Xinghua, Jingjiang, and Baoying counties have respectively initiated individual competition proposals on autumn sowing, rapeseed, green manure, and diversified operations. The seven different types of regions in the prefecture have also launched classified competitions. The competition opponents are evenly matched. The competition content includes indicators and measures, competing both in the present and the future; competing both comprehensively and individually; competing both in production and distribution; competing both in work and leadership methods and style. The competition opponents also expressed mutual support and cooperation. Xinghua and Taizhou decided to transfer cadres and masses with rapeseed planting experience to support areas newly expanding rapeseed planting this year; Jingjiang decided to transfer some leading backbone personnel and production experts to support areas newly expanding green manure planting. Various localities also conduct regular inspections and evaluations by region.

After ten years of construction, especially the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the agricultural production landscape in Yangzhou Prefecture has undergone significant changes. This year's autumn harvest crops are also a bumper harvest. However, to strive for a great leap forward next year on the existing foundation, it is necessary to further solve the following problems: change the cropping system, ensuring both the expansion of wheat acreage and the increase in rapeseed and green manure acreage; ensuring both a good harvest in the first crop and increased production in the second crop. Farmland capital construction and water conservancy facilities must adapt to the irrigation needs of wheat in winter and spring, fertilization methods must adapt to the needs of high yield, and the level of cultivation and tools must adapt to the requirements of high-speed development of production, and so on. To solve these problems, it is first necessary to further establish the idea of a continued Great Leap Forward among cadres and the masses. As the autumn harvest was about to end and the autumn sowing season was approaching, the prefectural committee and the county committees of various counties sent capable cadres deep into the grassroots to summarize the experiences created by the masses. After a period of work, advanced models were discovered in various places. The prefectural committee then gathered the first secretaries of the county committees and commune party committees, and through traveling on-site meetings, discussed theory based on practice, watching and discussing simultaneously. This on-site meeting was well organized, with a prominent focus, rich content, and clear models, which promoted autumn planting and other work.

Everyone first visited the autumn planting model in Taizhou County. The autumn planting in this county not only had good specifications and quality, but also, in response to the characteristics of having more people and less land, concentrated and developed the experience of local areas and other places such as Jingjiang, Yangzhou, and Haimen, based on the original intercropping and multiple cropping. They arranged crop rotations reasonably from the perspective of year-round production, considering both the present and the future, in three different types of regions. The main practices promoted were the "intercropping of beans and wheat, mixed planting of wheat and grass (grass seeds), multiple cropping of cotton, early corn, and early soybeans in wheat fields, and rotation of rice and cotton, and paddy and dry land" cropping systems. The advantage of doing this is that single cropping can be changed to multiple cropping, successive cropping can be changed to rotation, winter fallow land can be used for wheat and grass (grass seeds) cultivation, dry land can be used for paddy fields, and late crops can be changed to early crops, which can achieve both high yield and cultivate soil fertility; it can expand planting area, improve land utilization rate, and facilitate the arrangement of crop rotations, as well as the interlacing and adjustment of farm work, ensuring that agricultural time is not missed and timely sowing is carried out. For example, intercropping wheat and green manure, wheat can help green manure resist the cold and overwinter, and green manure can add nutrients to wheat, promoting each other's growth. Another example is that in the past, cotton was often planted in wheat stubble fields, especially wheat stubble fields, which often resulted in late planting and reduced production. After intercropping, green manure can be cut and cotton can be intercropped before the wheat harvest, so that timely sowing can be achieved. In the past, winter fallow land had to be reserved to plant early autumn crops, but after intercropping and multiple cropping, the early autumn crop rotation was expanded. After Taizhou County promoted this cropping system, the area of three wheat crops increased from 600,000 mu to 800,000 mu, and the area of green manure was also increased.

Can some farmland capital construction be carried out in conjunction with autumn planting? After visiting the sites in Gaoyou and Baoying, everyone learned from the experience of making water conservancy plans centered on autumn sowing. In the water conservancy planning of these two counties, the projects that directly benefit wheat season and next year's autumn harvest production were arranged specifically. In autumn planting, the main focus is on building branch canals and farm canals, and reserving space for small and medium-sized ditches that must be repaired this winter and spring. The advantage of doing this is that it saves land and labor, and avoids wasting resources by planting first and then digging. This can also ensure the quality of the canals, because the channels made in autumn are consolidated through winter and spring, and the embankment is firm, which can avoid leakage and collapse. After the visit, everyone believed that the irrigation and drainage problems of wheat this winter and spring must be solved vigorously, and a good irrigation and drainage canal system must be established; they expressed their willingness to do as much farmland water conservancy as possible based on the existing labor force, while ensuring the area, quality, and season.

Everyone also visited the sideline industry exhibition hall in Baoying County and listened to the introduction of the Baoying County Party Committee, believing that their guiding ideology for preparing production funds for next year's Great Leap Forward was very clear, and the slogans were very good: "Ensure the marshal of grain, develop diversified operations; promote a great leap forward in both agricultural and sideline production, improve both self-sufficiency production and commodity production; grasp both grain and money, and improve both production and life; exceed quotas for all indicators, and achieve full success in every commune and team." The approach is also correct: first, "to make the land produce more treasures," that is, to widely plant terrestrial cash crops, which will increase threefold this year compared to last year; second, "to cleverly obtain treasures from the water's embrace," that is, to vigorously develop aquatic animals and plants, which will increase by 50% this year compared to last year; third, "to vigorously develop household treasures," that is, to develop animal husbandry, which will increase by 60% to 70% this year compared to last year; and fourth, "to create more treasures from treasures," that is, to engage in more processing of agricultural and sideline products, which will increase by 10% this year compared to last year. The measures are very specific, mainly comprehensive planning, unified arrangement, organizing professional teams, vigorously developing bases, and achieving comprehensive blooming. The total output value of sideline industries in the county will double this year compared to last year.

Jiangdu County's vigorous promotion of tool reform around autumn harvest, autumn planting, and winter farmland capital construction also gave everyone a deep inspiration.

The facts of advanced areas have promoted leaders at all levels to see the current new situation clearly. Everyone realized that this year's autumn planting must not remain at the old level, but must be done better than in previous years; realizing that it is necessary to grasp both the present and the future; grasp both grain, cotton, and oil, and diversified operations; realizing that the experience of the existing advanced models lays the foundation for vigorously developing diversified operations in winter, comprehensively carrying out farmland capital construction, and vigorously reforming agricultural tools. The results of the winter's vigorous efforts will provide conditions for a greater leap forward next year. Unanimously reflected: the current situation is excellent, it is a new high tide, determined to work hard for the Great Leap Forward next year. The entire region is divided into seven different types of regions, such as two crops of rice and wheat, one crop of paddy fields, etc., classified and divided into blocks, adapting to local conditions, and comprehensively planning next year's production, discussing and formulating indicators and basic measures for agricultural and sideline production. The area of three wheat crops determined by the entire region was expanded from the original 5.5 million mu to 5.7 million mu, rapeseed was expanded from 100,000 mu last year to 530,000 mu this year, and green manure increased sharply from 500,000 mu last year to 1.25 million mu. The entire autumn sowing area increased by 34.8% compared to last year.

In order to realize the leap forward plan, leaders at all levels deeply exposed and criticized new complacency, fear of hardship, determinism, middle-of-the-roadism, the impossibility of a further leap with a large base, and other right-leaning conservative ideas. Currently, the competition to strive for a great leap forward next year is vigorously unfolding in various parts of the region. The autumn planting movement is sweeping forward like a broken bamboo, with 1.21 million athletes fighting intensely. (Attached image)

    抓今冬又抓明年，赛生产又赛工作
    扬州专区围绕秋种开展竞赛争取明年大跃进
    本报讯　中共扬州地委用革命精神搞秋种，促使各地围绕秋种规划明年生产，全面开展争取明年大跃进的竞赛。现在，泰州、兴化、靖江、宝应等四县，已分别就秋播、油菜、绿肥、多种经营等发起了单项竞赛倡议。全区七个不同类型地区的公社，也已分类开展了竞赛。竞赛对手，旗鼓相当。竞赛内容，有指标，有措施，既赛当前，又赛明年；既赛全面，又赛单项；既赛生产，又赛分配；既赛工作，又赛领导方法和作风。竞赛对手并表示互相支持，互相协作。兴化、泰州决定调出有种油菜经验的干部和群众，支持今年新扩种油菜的地区；靖江决定抽调一部分领导骨干和生产能手，支持新扩种绿肥的地区，各地并以片为单位，定期检查，定期评比。
    扬州专区经过十年建设、特别是两年大跃进，农业生产面貌有了很大变化。今年秋熟作物又是大丰收。但是要在现有基础上争取明年大跃进，还必须进一步解决以下几个问题：改变耕作制度，既要保证扩大麦子面积，又要增加油菜、绿肥面积；既要上熟丰收，又要下熟增产。农田基本建设、水利设施要与麦子冬春灌溉需要适应，施肥方法要与高产需要适应，耕作水平、工具要与高速度发展生产的要求适应等等。要解决这些问题，首先必需在干部和群众中进一步确立继续大跃进的思想。当秋收将要结束，秋播季节就要到来以前，地委和各县县委都派了得力干部深入基层总结群众创造的经验。经过一段时间的工作，各地先后发现了一些先进标兵。地委即集中了各县县委、公社党委第一书记，通过旅行现场会议，就实论虚，边看边议。这次现场会议开得好，中心突出，内容丰富，标兵鲜明，促进了秋种和其它工作。
    大家首先参观了泰州县的秋种样板。这个县的秋种不仅规格质量好，而且针对人多地少的特点，在原有间作套作基础上，集中和发展了本地和靖江、扬中、海门等外地的经验。他们分别三种地区，从全年生产出发，瞻前顾后，合理安排了茬口。主要是推行了“豆麦间作、麦草（草子）混种，麦地套作棉花、早玉米、早大豆，稻棉、水旱轮作”的耕作制度。这样做的好处是，可以变单作为套作，连作为轮作，冬闲田为麦、草（草子）田，旱田为水田，晚茬为早茬，既可以高产，又培养了地力；既扩大了种植面积，提高了土地利用率，又有利于茬口的安排，以及农活的穿插和调剂，保证不误农时，适时播种。例如，麦子与绿肥间作，麦子可以帮助绿肥御寒过冬，绿肥又为麦子增加养料，互相促使生长。又如，过去麦茬田、特别是小麦茬田种了棉花，往往造成迟种减产。间作以后，可以在麦收前割绿肥套棉花，做到及时播种。过去要种早秋，非留冬闲田不可，间作套作后，就扩大了早秋茬口。泰州全县推广这一耕作制度后，三麦面积由六十万亩扩大到八十万亩，又增加了绿肥面积。
    能不能结合秋种进行一部分农田基本建设？大家看了高邮、宝应两个现场后，学习了围绕秋播中心做好了水利规划的经验。这两个县在水利规划中，首先对麦季和明年秋熟生产直接发挥效益的工程安排得具体。在秋种中，主要是修建斗渠、农渠，对今冬明春非修不可的中小沟，则预留位置。这样做的好处是：节省土地、劳力，避免先种后挖，造成浪费。这样又能保证渠道质量，因为秋季做好渠道，经冬春沉实，堤身牢固，可以避免漏水溃决。参观以后，大家认为今冬明春麦子的灌排问题必须大力解决，建立好灌排渠系；纷纷表示要在保面积、保质量、保季节的前提下，根据现有劳力的可能，尽量多搞农田水利。
    大家还参观了宝应县的副业展览馆，听了宝应县委的介绍，认为他们为明年大跃进准备生产资金的指导思想很明确，口号很好：“确保粮食元帅，开展多种经营；农副业生产齐跃进，自给性生产和商品性生产同提高；既抓粮食又抓钱，生产生活都搞好；项项指标超定额，社社队队满堂红。”路子也很对头：一是“要叫土地多出宝”，就是广种陆地经济作物，今年比去年增长三倍；二是“智取水母怀中宝”，就是大搞水生动植物，今年比去年增产五成；三是“大力发展农家宝”，就是发展畜牧饲养，今年比去年增加60％到70％；四是“更要宝中再出宝”，就是多搞农副产品加工，今年比去年增加一成。措施很具体，主要是全面规划，统一安排，组织专业队伍，大搞基地，全面开花。全县今年副业总产值将比去年增加一倍。
    江都县围绕秋收秋种和冬季农田基本建设，大搞工具改革，也给大家很深的启发。
    先进地区的事实，促进各级领导看清了当前的新形势，大家认识到今年秋种绝不能停留在旧的水平上，而是要比往年搞得更好；认识到要既抓当前，又抓今后；既抓粮棉油，又抓多种经营；认识到已有的先进标兵的经验，为冬季大兴多种经营、全面展开农田基本建设、大搞农具改革打下基础。而冬季大干的结果，又为明年更大跃进提供了条件。一致反映：目前是大好的形势，是新高潮的形势，决心为明年大跃进而大干一场。全区共分稻麦两熟、一熟水田等七种不同类型地区，分类分块，因地制宜，全面规划了明年的生产，讨论制定了农副业生产的指标和基本措施。全区确定三麦面积由原定的五百五十万亩扩大到五百七十万亩，油菜由去年的十万亩扩大到今年的五十三万亩，绿肥由去年的五十万亩猛增到一百二十五万亩。整个秋播面积比去年扩大了34.8％。
    为了实现跃进规划，各级领导深入揭发和批判了新的麻痹自满、怕苦畏难、定局论、中游论、基数大再要大跳不可能等等右倾保守思想。目前，全区各地争取明年大跃进的竞赛正轰轰烈烈展开。秋种运动势如破竹，一百二十一万健儿紧张战斗。（附图片）
