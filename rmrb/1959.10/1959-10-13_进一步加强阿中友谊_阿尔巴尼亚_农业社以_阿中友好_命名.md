    阿尔巴尼亚—农业社以“阿中友好”命名
    新华社地拉那11日电　为了增进中国和阿尔巴尼亚的友谊，阿尔巴尼亚莱希区马巴农业生产合作社今天命名为“阿中友好”农业合作社，并举行了命名仪式。
    参加命名仪式的有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党莱希区委员会书记罗波和区执行委员会主席狄布拉等当地的党政机关领导人。我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆一等秘书王栋等也前往祝贺。
    今天，马巴村呈现了一片欢乐的节日气氛。村子的进口处，用长青的松柏搭起了一座高大的牌楼。村中心飘扬着阿中两国国旗，在小学校的门前举办了介绍中国的小型图片展览。穿着民族服装的男女社员们欢乐地忙着迎接这一喜庆的日子。
    这天中午，举行了命名仪式。当农业合作社社长丘尼宣布该社以“阿中友好”命名时，全场响起了热烈的掌声和欢呼声。丘尼说，我们全体社员都以这一友好的名字感到光荣。我们决心办好农业社，以进一步加强阿中友谊。

    以“阿中友好”命名的马巴合作社是在1956年建立的。三年多来，合作社的生产发展很快，社员从十八户发展到了七十五户，谷物产量比土地改革前增加了一倍半。过去，全社只有四头牛，而今天已有四十五头乳牛，二百只羊和一百十三口猪。
