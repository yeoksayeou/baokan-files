Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th: Winter sowing in Zhejiang is progressing rapidly with high quality. The province's winter sowing area has exceeded ten million mu, with sowing time ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years, laying a good foundation for striving for a bumper harvest of spring flower crops next year.

At the start of winter sowing, Cixi and Xiaoshan counties, high-yield areas for spring flower crops, launched a socialist high-yield competition to the whole province to strive for a special leap forward in spring flower production next year. The two counties put forward the targets of "1,000 catties of wheat, 500 catties of rapeseed, 800 catties of broad beans, and 10,000 catties of grass seeds (green manure)", and various specific measures to achieve these targets. After the news spread, more than fifty counties and cities in the province responded, formulated leap forward targets, proposed strong measures, and actively participated in the competition.

In the high-yield competition, various places further seriously summed up the experience of large-scale high yields of spring flower crops this year, established advanced models, and, through displaying yields, comparing high and low, finding reasons, and grasping measures, carried out mass-based big blooming, big contending, and big debate, criticized right-leaning conservative ideas such as "living in the middle reaches," "reporting actual figures," and "losing money in planting rapeseed," and raised the consciousness of the vast number of cadres and members to strive for the upstream. Many cadres and members in Yuyao, Jinhua, Longyou and other counties analyzed many favorable conditions for striving for high yields of spring flower crops in the big blooming, big contending, and big debate. Therefore, the indicators in winter planting production in these counties were advanced, the measures were strong, and the sowing of wheat and rapeseed was fast and good, and the high-yield competition quickly and vigorously developed.

People's communes in various places also formulated spring flower technical operating procedures according to the leap forward targets and high-yield experience, established technical training courses, and established inspection and acceptance systems to guarantee the quality of winter planting. Rural cadres in various places took the lead in hard work, practical work, and skillful work in the high-yield competition movement, universally carried out high-yield experimental fields, adopted advanced technologies, and timely summarized and promoted them.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 20th: The prelude to the winter planting upsurge in Guangxi has begun. Millions of members throughout the autonomous region are tilling and sowing in the mountains and fields, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, with people and vehicles coming and going, as busy as spring plowing production. This year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to plant 10,840,000 mu in winter, an increase of 1.25 times over the actual winter planting area last year. According to statistics as of the 16th, 2,510,000 mu of overwintering crops have been planted in various places.

Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the movement to increase production and practice economy in the entire autonomous region is like a spring tide, rising higher and higher, and the leap forward situation is different every day. In early October, Xincheng County took the lead and issued a winter planting competition proposal to the counties in Liuzhou Prefecture. The county plans to plant 255,000 mu in winter, and strive to harvest 130 catties of grain per person in addition to radishes and rapeseed. Subsequently, all parts of the autonomous region put forward inspiring slogans: "Strive to harvest one more season of grain" and "Carry out a movement of 150 catties of grain and 300 to 500 catties of vegetables per person." In the movement, various places universally carried out big debates and big summaries, criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas, and therefore the target of the autonomous region's plan to plant 10,840,000 mu in winter was quickly broken by the 14 million mu reported by various counties and communes.

In order to over fulfill the winter planting plan and strive for a bumper harvest of winter crops, various places have been racing against time since the beginning of winter planting. Guilin, Liuzhou and other prefectures began plowing and planting twenty days to a month earlier than last year. Xinglong Commune in Mashan County divided into two teams, one harvesting rice and the other engaging in winter planting. The commune harvested 812 mu, and quickly planted 544 mu with wheat crops. The majority of winter crops in Yulin Prefecture are planted in paddy fields. At present, the late rice has not yet been harvested, and the members are seizing this gap to accumulate and create the fertilizer needed for winter planting.

With the expansion of the winter planting area, various places have also adopted various methods to solve the seed problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th: Various places in Guangdong have launched a large-scale winter planting campaign just after the autumn planting has ended and before the late rice harvest.

This year, the planned winter planting area in Guangdong Province is 18 million mu to 20 million mu, which is larger than the winter planting area in any previous year. At present, more than 3 million people in the province are engaged in fertilizer accumulation and rush planting activities every day. According to preliminary statistics, more than 750 million dan of various local miscellaneous fertilizers have been accumulated and produced; Shaoguan and Shantou Prefectures, which started the winter planting season earlier and acted faster, have rushed to plant more than 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes and winter crops such as barley and wheat.

Early arrangement and rapid action are the characteristics of winter planting work in Guangdong this year. Guangdong, which has three crops a year, has always had the habit of winter planting, but in the past, some places did not really treat it as a production season, and often only planned winter planting after the late rice was harvested, planting as much as they could. This year, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and party committees at all levels have seriously grasped winter planting, and began planning and making arrangements as early as last month. People's communes in various places have launched mass discussions when specifically arranging winter planting land, seeds, fertilizers, and labor, overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas such as "winter planting is not cost-effective," "no fertilizer," and "it's still early," and started early to carry out various preparatory work. In the winter planting planning, people's communes in various places have tried every possible means to expand the planting area. The major teams of Jingdu Commune in Chaoyang County mobilized the masses to fully discuss and found many ways to expand the winter planting area, such as intercropping, interplanting, rotation, and wasteland expansion, so that the planned winter planting area was expanded from the original 10,000 mu to more than 16,000 mu.

Accumulating sufficient fertilizer is the key to completing the winter planting plan and ensuring a bumper harvest. Various places have quickly launched a large-scale mass movement to attack the fertilizer barrier by going up the mountains and down the waters. More than 1.1 million people in Shantou Prefecture are mobilized to accumulate fertilizer every day, and more than 57 million dan of various local miscellaneous fertilizers have been accumulated in a few days. In Wengyuan County, Shaoguan Prefecture, more than 50% of the members participated in accumulating fertilizer, and now each mu has more than 40 dan of fertilizer.

While vigorously carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement, various places also implemented preparation and rush planting at the same time, and rushed to plant all the wasteland and land that could be intercropped.

    反右倾　破保守　树新风　让春花遍地红
    南方三省冬种势如春潮
    浙江五十多个县市开展丰产竞赛　广西广东及早动手扩大冬种面积
    据新华社杭州20日电　浙江各地冬播进度快，质量高。全省冬播面积已超过一千万亩，播种时间比往年早十天到半月，为争取明年春花作物大丰收打下良好基础。
    冬播一开始，春花作物高产县慈溪和萧山两县就向全省各县发起了争取明年春花生产特大跃进的社会主义丰产竞赛。这两个县提出了“千斤麦、五百斤油菜籽、八百斤蚕豆、万斤草子（绿肥）”的指标，和实现这些指标的各项具体措施。消息传出后，全省五十多个县市纷纷响应，制订跃进指标，提出有力措施，积极参加竞赛。
    各地在丰产竞赛中，进一步认真总结了今年春花作物大面积高产的经验，树立先进标兵，通过摆产量，比高低，找原因，抓措施，开展群众性的大鸣大放大辩论，批判了“安居中游”、“实报实销”、“种油菜亏本”等右倾保守思想，提高了广大干部和社员力争上游的自觉性。余姚、金华、龙游等县很多干部和社员在大鸣大放大辩论中，分析了争取春花作物高产的许多有利条件，因此，这些县在冬种生产中指标先进，措施有力，小麦、油菜播种又快又好，丰产竞赛很快就轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    各地人民公社还根据跃进指标和高产经验，因地制宜地订出春花技术操作规程，举办技术训练班，建立检查验收制度，用这些办法来保证冬种的质量。各地农村干部在丰产竞赛运动中纷纷带头苦干、实干、巧干，普遍搞高产试验田，采用先进技术，并且及时总结推广。
    据新华社南宁20日电　广西冬种高潮序幕已揭开。全自治区数以百万计的社员，正在山野田间整地播种，积肥送肥，人来车往，繁忙有如春耕生产。今年，广西僮族自治区计划冬种一千零八十四万亩，比去年实际冬种面积增加一点二五倍。到16日统计，各地已经种下越冬作物二百五十一万亩。
    在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，全自治区的增产节约运动，势如春潮，节节高涨，跃进形势，日日不同。10月初，忻城县一马当先，向柳州专区各县发出冬种竞赛倡议，全县计划冬种二十五万五千亩，除萝卜、油菜外，争取每人收粮一百三十斤。接着，全自治区各地都提出了振奋人心的口号：“争取多收一季粮”，“开展每人一百五十斤粮，三百至五百斤蔬菜运动”。在运动中，各地普遍进行了大辩论，大总结，批判各种右倾保守思想，因此自治区计划冬种一千零八十四万亩的指标，很快就被各县社自报的一千四百万亩所突破。
    为了超额完成冬种计划，争取冬种作物大丰收，冬种一开始，各地就分秒必争地抢季节。桂林、柳州等专区都比去年提早二十天到一个月左右开犁下种。马山县兴隆公社分做两套人马，一套收水稻，一套搞冬种，全社收了八百一十二亩，很快就有五百四十四亩种上了麦类作物。玉林专区的冬种作物绝大部分是种在水田里，目前晚稻尚未收割，社员们便抓住这个空隙大积大造冬种需要的肥料。
    随着冬种面积的扩大，各地还采取了多种多样的办法解决了种子问题。
    据新华社广州20日电　广东各地在秋种刚结束和晚稻收割前夕，已经展开了规模巨大的冬种活动。
    今年，广东省冬种计划面积为一千八百万亩至二千万亩，比以往任何一年的冬种面积都大。目前，全省每天有三百多万人投入积肥、抢种等活动。据初步统计已积制各种土杂肥七亿五千多万担；冬种季节较早、行动较快的韶关、汕头两专区，已抢种了番薯和大麦、小麦等越冬作物五十多万亩。
    安排得早、行动迅速，是广东各地今年冬种工作的特点。一年三熟的广东，历来有冬种习惯，但过去有些地方，并没有真正把它作为一造生产来抓，往往在晚稻收割以后才规划冬种，种多少算多少。今年，中共广东省委和各级党委都认真地抓了冬种，早在上月就开始进行规划，并作了安排。各地人民公社在具体安排冬种土地、种子、肥料和劳动力时，都展开了群众性的大讨论，克服了“冬种不合算”、“无肥料”、“时间还早”等右倾保守思想，及早动手，展开各项准备工作。在进行冬种规划中，各地人民公社都千方百计扩大种植面积。潮阳县井都公社各大队发动群众充分讨论，找到了许多扩大冬种面积的办法，如间种、套种、轮种、开荒扩种等等，使冬种计划面积由原来的一万亩，扩大到一万六千多亩。
    积足肥料是完成冬种计划和保证丰收的关键。各地都迅速掀起了声势浩大的群众运动，上山下水大战肥料关。汕头专区每天有一百一十多万人出动积肥，在几天内就积了各种土杂肥五千七百多万担。韶关专区翁源县，50％以上的社员参加了积肥，现在，每亩已有肥料四十多担。
    各地在大搞积肥运动的同时，还实行边准备、边抢种，把开荒扩种和可以间种的土地，都抢先种下。
