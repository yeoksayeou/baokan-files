Picking New Cotton to Pile Up Like Mountains
—Celebrating the Great Cotton Harvest of Huanglu People's Commune

	In the deep autumn season on the northern bank of Chaohu Lake, cotton plants stand closely together, stretching to the horizon. This cotton sea in the autumn colors, illuminated by the October sun, resembles the sparkling stars of a summer night. This is a true portrayal of the large-scale high-yield cotton of Huanglu People's Commune (formerly Fuxing Commune) in Chaoxian County, a newly developed high-yield cotton area in Anhui Province.

	Huanglu People's Commune began trial planting the fine cotton variety "Dai Zi Cotton" in 1954. In just five short years, the yield has increased year after year. In 1958, there was a special Great Leap Forward, with the commune's more than 21,000 mu of cotton fields achieving an average yield of up to 525 jin of ginned cotton per mu! This year's 23,003 mu of cotton, after actual measurement, will reach 630 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 20% over last year. This yield is eighty-two times higher than before liberation in 1948, and more than sixty times higher than when native cotton was planted in 1952.

	The great harvest has attracted many visitors from far and wide. To allow those who do not have the opportunity to come to the shores of Chaohu Lake to share the joy of the cotton farmers of Huanglu People's Commune, we are introducing a group of photos here.

	The commune members call the cotton they cultivate "cotton trees," which is really not an exaggeration. Look at that twenty-three-year-old female commune member standing on a stool, still unable to reach the top of the cotton plant. (Picture 3) The children were so happy to see this scene that they jumped and clapped their little hands, singing a children's song:

	"Cotton so high, can't reach, can't reach, need a little table; little table low, need a big ladder, sisters still think it's not enough, zoom, zoom, fly up in a small plane; give me a flower to take to Beijing, silver flowers to give to Chairman Mao."

	How much cotton can such a tall cotton tree produce? The young girl Zhang Xiuyin stayed here picking basket after basket, and there are still so many silver flowers blooming. She smiles, sings, and picks flowers. How could she not like such high-yielding cotton?! (Picture 1)

	How much cotton can the commune harvest this year? A commune member put it well in a poem: "Looking from afar, the cotton piles on the threshing ground are white, one would suspect it is snow on the Kunlun Mountains..." This photo (Picture 2), taken on just one threshing ground, can certainly prove this point to everyone.

	These days, the gongs and drums of Huanglu People's Commune are getting louder and louder. Unable to restrain the joy in their hearts, the cotton farmers, carrying red flags, amidst the enthusiastic sounds of gongs and drums, stride swiftly to the purchasing station with load after load of the whitest and best cotton, selling it to the state (Picture 4).

	Seeing this, you may ask: Why is the speed of the leap forward so fast in this newly developed cotton area? My first answer is that the commune's Party committee adheres to putting politics in command, and with the spirit of continuous revolution, vigorously carries out mass technical innovation movements. The mass upsurge of learning technology has risen even higher since the Great Leap Forward. From the secretary to the commune members, everyone wants to create miracles, and everyone is showing their talents. Now, more than 90% of the cadres and masses in the commune have mastered the complete set of cotton planting techniques, and a large number of cotton planting experts and thirty-eight local experts have emerged.

    摘下新棉堆座山
    ——喜庆黄麓公社棉花大丰收
    深秋时节的巢湖北岸，棉树一株紧挨一株，远接天边。在10月阳光照耀下的这片棉海秋色，宛如夏夜闪烁的繁星。这便是安徽省新近成长的一个高产棉区——巢县黄麓公社（原复兴公社）大面积丰产棉花的真实写照。
    黄麓公社在1954年开始试种良种棉花“岱字棉”，时间只有短短的五年，产量却连年增加。1958年来了个特大的跃进，全社两万一千多亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉高达五百二十五斤！今年的两万三千零三亩棉花，经过实测，将达到亩产皮棉六百三十斤，又比去年增加20％。这个产量比1948年解放前增加八十二倍，比1952年种土棉时也高六十多倍。
    大丰收，引来了远近许许多多前来参观的人。为了让没有机会来到巢湖之滨的人，也能分享到黄麓公社棉农们的喜悦，我们特地介绍一组照片在这里。
    社员们把自己培植的棉花称作“棉花树”，真的不算是夸张，你看那二十三岁的女社员站在凳子上伸手还够不到棉花顶心哩。（图3）小朋友们见了这种情景乐的直是蹦，拍着小手唱起儿歌来：
    “棉花高，够不着，够不着，搭小桌；小桌低，搭大梯，姐姐还嫌不济事，呼呼驾起小飞机；给我一朵上北京，银花送给毛主席。”
    这样高大的棉花树，能收获多少棉呢？年青姑娘张秀银，呆在这里拾了一兜又一兜，盛开的银花还有这么多。她笑着，唱着，摘着花。这样高产的棉花，怎能叫她不喜欢！？（图1）
    今年公社能收多少棉花？社员有一句诗说得好：“远看场上棉堆白，疑是昆仑山上雪……”这张仅仅在一个场基上拍下的照片（图2），当然可以向大家证明这点。
    这些天，黄麓公社的锣鼓越敲越响。抑制不住心头喜悦的棉农们，扛着红旗，在热烈的锣鼓声中，健步如飞地把一担担最白最好的棉花送到收购站，出售给国家（图4）。
    看到这里，也许你要问：这个刚刚成长起来的新棉区，跃进的速度为什么这么快？我回答的第一条，便是公社党委坚持政治挂帅，以不断革命精神，大搞群众性的技术革新运动的结果。群众性的学技术的热潮，大跃进以后更高涨，从书记到社员，人人都想创奇迹，个个都在显神通。现在全社90％以上的干部和群众，掌握了植棉的全套技术，并且出现了大批植棉能手和三十八位土专家。
