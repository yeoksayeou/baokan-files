　　The Mudanjiang Hardware and Electrical Appliance Factory Mobilizes the Masses to Promote Advanced Experience
　　One Month's Plan Completed in Eleven Days
    Our newspaper, Harbin, 15th dispatch: The Mudanjiang Hardware and Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory in Heilongjiang Province uses the mass line method to summarize and promote advanced experience. This method of mass summarization and mass promotion and application has brought about a new situation of comprehensive upsurge in the factory's production.
    At present, the factory has summarized more than 140 advanced experiences created by the masses themselves, and more than 900 people have successively caught up with the production level of the creators of advanced experiences. After comprehensively overfulfilling the third quarter plan, the production plan for October was comprehensively completed ahead of schedule on October 11.
    In August, after the factory's workers opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted their energy, their labor enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, but the phenomenon of simply relying on physical strength also appeared among some workers. In order to improve this situation in a timely manner, the factory's Party committee put forward the call to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, while vigorously promoting advanced experience, guiding the enthusiasm of the masses to learn from the advanced and compete in wisdom. It also organized the trade union to cooperate with the administration, adopting the "five-side" method of summarizing and appraising, mobilizing and educating, publicizing and promoting, examining and testing, and consolidating and improving, to mobilize all the factory's employees to conduct a large-scale investigation and summary of advanced experiences from the bottom up. At the beginning, some young workers were unconvinced about summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of others, thinking it was almost the same and there was nothing to learn; individual old workers felt it was not honorable to learn the advanced experience of apprentices. The factory's Party committee immediately carried out extensive education and self-education activities among all the factory's employees, so that everyone further realized that advanced experience is social wealth. A trend of learning from whoever is advanced was universally established among the employees.
    This factory organized various production teams to use the methods of three investigations, five comparisons, and one finding (investigate political thought, investigate original records, investigate operation methods; compare thought, compare quality, compare output, compare discipline, compare safety; find advanced experience) to summarize various production experiences. In order to systematize the discovered bits and pieces of experience, the mass line method was adopted for summarization, with the creator introducing, the masses supplementing, and the leadership reviewing. Due to the comprehensive mobilization of the masses, the first batch summarized more than 140 advanced experiences, including not only 127 locally-grown advanced experiences, but also 10 advanced experiences learned from other factories; not only advanced experiences in production technology, but also experiences in management work and service work. It achieved that every line of work has advanced experience to learn from. At the same time, due to the adoption of methods such as marking, visiting, testing, and the combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians for appraisal in the summary, the experience itself not only comprehensively implemented the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, but was also recognized and understood by the masses, making it extremely easy to promote. For example, the electromechanical workshop's pressing and sorting team promoted the comprehensive advanced experience of "one inspection, four diligences, and three combinations," and the team's daily output quickly increased thirtyfold.
    After the advanced experience was summarized, the factory leadership further grasped the promotion work. In addition to organizing observation and demonstration performances, advanced experience dissemination teams, and activities such as sending people out to learn and inviting people in to teach, they also organized an advanced experience learning "great training" activity week, launching a large-scale study, large-scale publicity, large-scale visits, and large-scale performances throughout the factory, forming a booming upsurge in promoting advanced experience. In the welding rod workshop, 70% of the workers reached the advanced level in just one week.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the advanced experience promotion work, the factory headquarters and workshops also established advanced experience promotion work committees, and each team (section) established advanced experience promotion teams, adopting the "five combinations" approach, that is, combining learning from the advanced experience of others with summarizing and applying their own experience, combining promoting advanced experience with innovation and creation; combining promoting advanced experience with strengthening management; combining promoting advanced experience with competition; and combining promoting existing experience with continuously planning, summarizing, and promoting new experience. This ensures the consolidation and improvement of existing advanced experience.

　　处处离不了群众运动事事离不了群众运动  哪里群众发动起来了哪里就搞得热气腾腾
　　牡丹江五金电器厂发动群众推广先进经验
　　一个月计划十一天完成
    本报哈尔滨15日电　黑龙江省牡丹江五金电器制造厂运用群众路线的方法总结推广先进经验。这种群众总结、群众推广运用的方法，使全厂生产出现了全面高涨的新局面。
    目前，全厂已总结出一百四十多项群众自己创造的先进经验，九百多人陆续赶上了先进经验创造者的生产水平。在全面超额完成三季度计划之后，10月份的生产计划又提前在10月11日全面完成。
    8月，这个厂的职工经过反右倾鼓干劲以后，劳动热情空前高涨，可是在部分工人中也出现了单纯拼体力的现象。工厂党委为了及时改进这种状况，就提出了大闹技术革新和技术革命的号召，同时大力推广先进经验，把群众的干劲引导到学先进、赛智慧的大比大赛上来。并组织工会协同行政，采取边总结鉴定、边动员教育、边宣传推广、边考试测验和边巩固提高等“五边”的方法，发动全厂职工自下而上地对先进经验进行大普查、大总结。在开始的时候，有些青年工人对总结推广别人的先进经验不服气，认为差不多，没啥可学；个别老工人认为学习徒工的先进经验不光彩。工厂党委随即在全厂职工中广泛开展了教育和自我教育活动，使大家进一步认识到先进经验是社会财富。在职工中普遍树立了谁先进向谁学的风气。
    这个工厂组织各生产小组运用三查、五比、一找（查政治思想、查原始记录、查操作方法；比思想、比质量、比产量、比纪律、比安全；把先进经验找出来）的做法，总结各项生产经验。为了使发现的点滴经验系统化，又采取群众路线的办法进行了总结，由创造者作介绍、群众补充，领导审查。由于全面发动了群众，第一批就总结了一百四十多项先进经验，其中不仅有土生土长的先进经验一百二十七项，还有十项是学习外厂的先进经验；不仅有生产技术方面的先进经验，还有管理工作和服务工作等各方面的经验。做到行行有先进经验可学。同时，由于在总结中，采取了标定、访问、试验及领导干部，工人和技术人员三结合鉴定等做法，经验本身既全面贯彻多快好省的精神，又为群众所公认了解，极便于推广，如机电车间压选组推广了“一检、四勤、三结合”的综合先进经验，小组日产量迅速提高了三十倍。
    在先进经验总结出来之后，工厂领导又进一步抓住了推广工作。除组织观摩表演、先进经验传播队传播，以及派出去学、请进来教等活动外，还组织了学习先进经验“大炼兵”活动周，在全厂发动了大学习、大宣传、大参观、大表演，形成了轰轰烈烈的推广先进经验的热潮。电焊条车间仅一周时间内，就有70％的工人达到先进水平。
    为加强对先进经验推广工作的领导，这个厂厂部和车间还成立了推广先进经验工作委员会，各小组（工段）建立了推广先进经验小组，采取“五结合”的做法，即学习别人的先进经验与总结运用自己的经验相结合，推广先进经验和革新创造相结合；推广先进经验和加强管理相结合；推广先进经验与竞赛相结合；推广现有经验与不断规划总结推广新经验相结合。这样就保证了已有先进经验的巩固和提高。
