Fully Utilize the Experience of Leading Production During Last Year's Great Leap Forward
Hubei's Autumn Planting Progresses Quickly and with Good Quality
Combine Autumn Plowing and Planting with Large-Scale Water Conservancy and Diversified Operations

(Reported by our newspaper) As of October 18th, various autumn crops in Hubei Province had been sown on 28,980,000 mu, reaching 67% of the plan, including over 19,660,000 mu of grain crops, reaching 65% of the plan. This year's autumn planting progress is also much faster than last year's; the current sown area of various autumn crops is four times that of the same period last year. Judging from deep plowing, close planting, and fertilization, the quality of this year's autumn planting is also better than last year's. The province has already autumn-plowed over 32,000,000 mu of land, of which more than 80% has been deep-plowed to a depth of six inches or more; the sowing amount is generally around 17 to 20 jin; the province has accumulated 6 billion dan of fertilizer, which, calculated according to the planned sown area for grain and rapeseed, averages 150 dan per mu.

This year, the following experiences have been gained in leading the autumn plowing and planting campaign:

First, thoroughly criticize right-leaning thought, boldly mobilize the masses, resolutely implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and boldly carry out technical reforms. The eighth production team leader of Gaoqiao Commune in Xingshan County announced a "discipline" during winter planting: only broadcast sowing was allowed; anyone who row-sowed would have work points deducted. He called the broadcast-sown fields "anti-struggle fields." The Xingshan County Party Committee seized upon this erroneous practice as a typical example and launched a large-scale debate in the county (in which 70% of adults participated). The debate was lively and forceful, leaving no hiding place for conservative ideas, and quickly set off a new upsurge of autumn planting technical reforms throughout the county. In autumn planting, Public Security County, through summarizing evaluations and rectification in the fields, had 170,000 people participate, posted nearly 90,000 big-character posters, established more than 130 red-flag units, and evaluated more than 4,300 model individuals, criticizing a group of people with serious right-leaning conservative ideas, thereby accelerating the autumn planting progress and improving quality. The province promptly promoted the experience of Xingshan and Public Security, emphasizing the presentation of facts and reasoning in the debate, convincing people with reason, establishing healthy tendencies, and suppressing unhealthy trends.

Second, vigorously develop high-yield experimental fields and vigorously conduct high-yield competitions. In Jingzhou Prefecture, 130,000 cadres planted 1,200,000 mu of high-yield experimental fields (including those jointly planted with the masses). In Zaoyang County's 1,200,000 mu of wheat, high-yield experimental fields accounted for more than 400,000 mu, and the indicators of these fields were much higher than those of ordinary fields. Driven by the cadres, the high-yield competition movement between regions, communes, production teams, and individuals was in full swing. The people of the famous old revolutionary base area of ​​Hong'an County have launched a friendly challenge to the entire province to do a good job in winter planting. The people of Macheng County immediately stepped forward to accept the challenge and sent a declaration of war to Xinzhou County. The people of Zaoyang County in the hilly area of ​​northwestern Hubei attacked from both sides, battling Xiangyang to the west and competing with Suixian to the east.

Third, vigorously strengthen inspections and evaluations. Recently, various places have organized mass-based, large-scale quality inspections of autumn plowing and planting, which has played a huge role in ensuring quality. However, the phenomena of rough autumn planting, shallow plowing, insufficient fertilizer, sparse planting, and broadcast sowing still continue to appear in various places, but due to close inspections and evaluations, rework and rectification have generally been achieved. In order to ensure quality, Xiangyang County organized a comprehensive evaluation and inspection when autumn planting of coarse grains was about to end, rectifying deficiencies, summarizing experience, and proposing improvement measures to guide wheat sowing work.

Fourth, vigorously level land, improve soil, and vigorously promote garden-style farming, terracing, and terraced fields. Of the 1,500,000 mu of autumn planting area in Zaoyang County, more than 900,000 mu have been leveled, and more than 400,000 mu have basically achieved garden-style farming. In Hong'an County, 80,000 mu of dead yellow soil have been improved, and 70,000 mu of winter-idle mud fields are being improved by means of ditching, adding sand, and adding soil.

Fifth, organize visits and learning, and promote each other. The Huji Commune in Zhongxiang County organized 650 cadres to visit Puhe Commune in Yicheng, conducting rectification while visiting. After returning, they held a mass oath-taking rally of more than 30,000 people, loudly proposing the slogan "Learn from Puhe, surpass Puhe." Currently, various places are widely adopting this experience to promote production.

Sixth, comprehensively arrange work, taking autumn plowing and planting as the center to drive a comprehensive leap forward in other work. In addition to the autumn planting upsurge that has already formed, a water conservancy construction upsurge has also begun in Xiangyang region. Some places in Yidu and Huanggang regions have also begun to construct water conservancy projects, and diversified operations, especially fishing and harvesting various domestic and wild plants, are also progressing rapidly.

    充分运用去年大跃进中领导生产的经验
    湖北秋种进度快质量好
    结合秋耕秋种大兴水利大搞多种经营
    本报讯　湖北各地截至10月18日为止，全省各种秋种作物已播种二千八百九十八万亩，达到计划的67％，其中粮食作物一千九百六十六万多亩，达到计划的65％。今年秋种的进度也比去年快得多，目前已播种的各种秋种作物面积为去年同期的四倍。从深耕、密植、施肥来看，今年的秋种质量也比去年好。全省已经秋耕土地三千二百多万亩，其中深耕六寸以上的占80％以上；播种量一般十七斤到二十斤左右；全省已积肥料六十亿担，按播种粮食、油菜计划面积计算，每亩平均有一百五十担。
    今年领导秋耕秋种运动有以下几点经验：
    第一，彻底批判右倾思想，放手发动群众，坚决贯彻“八字宪法”，大胆进行技术改革。兴山县高桥公社第八生产队队长在冬播中宣布一条“纪律”：只准撒播，谁条播要扣工分。他把撒播田叫做“对抗田”。兴山县委抓住这个错误做法作为典型事例，在全县开展大辩论（有70％的成年人参加），辩得有声有色，使保守思想无处躲藏，很快就在全县掀起了一个秋种技术改革的新高潮。公安县在秋种中通过总结评比、在田头进行整风，全县有十七万人参加，贴出大字报近九万张，树立了一百三十多个红旗单位，评出四千三百多个模范人物，批判了一批有严重右倾保守思想的人，秋种进度因此加快，质量提高。全省及时推广了兴山、公安的经验，在辩论中强调摆事实、讲道理，以理服人，树立了正气，压倒了歪风邪气。
    第二，大搞丰产试验田、大搞丰产竞赛。荆州专区有十三万名干部，种了一百二十万亩丰产试验田（包括和群众合种的）。枣阳县一百二十万亩小麦，其中丰产试验田就占四十多万亩，这些田的指标都比一般田高得多。在干部带动下，各地区、各公社以及生产队之间、人与人之间的丰产竞赛运动更是风起云涌，如火如荼。著名的革命老根据地红安县人民，已向全省发起搞好冬播的友谊挑战，麻城县人民马上挺身迎战，并向新洲县投下战表；在鄂西北岗地上的枣阳县人民左右开弓：西战襄阳，东赛随县。
    第三，大抓检查评比。最近，各地都组织了群众性的、大规模的秋耕秋种质量大检查，对保证质量起了巨大作用。但是秋种粗糙，浅耕、肥不足、稀植、撒播的现象在各地仍不断出现，但是由于抓紧检查评比，一般都做到了返工补火。为了保证质量，襄阳县在秋种杂粮将要结束时组织全面评比检查，一面补火，一面总结经验，提出改进措施来指导小麦播种工作。
    第四，大抓平整土地，改良土壤，大搞园田化、梯田化、梯地化。枣阳县一百五十万亩秋种面积，其中有九十多万亩平整了土地，有四十万亩基本实现了园田化。红安县十万亩死黄土地已改良了八万亩，七万亩冬闲烂泥田正在用开沟、加沙、加土的办法加以改良。
    第五，组织参观学习，互相促进。钟祥县胡集公社组织六百五十个干部到宜城蒲河公社边参观，边整风，回来以后开了三万多人的群众誓师大会，响亮提出“学蒲河、超蒲河”的口号。目前各地广泛采用这条经验推进生产。
    第六，全面安排工作，以秋耕秋种为中心带动其他工作全面跃进。襄阳地区除已形成秋种高潮外，兴修水利高潮也已开始出现；宜都、黄冈两个地区也有些地方开始动手兴修水利，多种经营，特别是捕鱼和收获各种家生、野生植物的进展也很快。
