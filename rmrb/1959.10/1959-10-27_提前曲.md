　　Among the gifts presented by construction heroes from various fronts to the "Conference of Heroes," the most numerous and best are undoubtedly those of "completing this year's production targets ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota." Drums and gongs resound to the skies, and good news is constantly reported. Everywhere, one only hears the cheers of aheadness, aheadness, aheadness.
　　Look! This project has just been completed ahead of schedule, and that new factory has been put into production ahead of schedule. Listen! The sound of gongs announcing that a batch of units have completed their monthly plans ahead of schedule has just rung out, and the sound of drums announcing that another batch of units have completed their quarterly plans ahead of schedule closely follows. The leaping tide has no end, and people always use even greater efforts to strive for a leap that is even greater than the last. If a project is completed ahead of schedule, it is imperative to seize the opportunity to ensure that the next project is also completed ahead of schedule; if monthly and quarterly plans are completed ahead of schedule, it is imperative to strive to continue to advance into the new year ahead of schedule.
　　Aheadness, aheadness, and more aheadness! This is the revolutionary upsurge ignited by the Party's general line for socialist construction; this is the revolutionary philosophy of Marxists. During the democratic revolution, we pushed the semi-feudal and semi-colonial, poor and backward old China onto the path of a prosperous and strong socialist new China ahead of schedule; during the period of national economic recovery, we healed the severe wounds of the national economy, ruthlessly destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionary government, ahead of schedule; after entering the period of socialist construction, we also completed the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Now, the Party is leading us to fight valiantly with full confidence to complete the main targets of the second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. We can proudly and unreservedly declare: We Communists are precisely proponents of aheadness!
　　Aheadness, aheadness, and more aheadness! This is the inevitable characteristic of the vigorous development of our socialist construction cause. Our cause is the rising sun, we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao grasping the direction of progress, we have more than 600 million people who have broken free from their shackles, and we have the support of the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.... All of this has converged into a huge torrent, which is riding the wind and waves to destroy all obstacles in the way forward, advancing at full speed towards the predetermined goal.
　　Aheadness, aheadness, and more aheadness! Like spring thunder, it shakes the earth, it urges all new things to grow quickly, and it makes all old things die quickly. All of this has frightened all right-leaning opportunists out of their wits. They suddenly panicked and gesticulated with pale faces: This is not good! That is terrible! In their view, there is a bottomless abyss ahead of us, and if we do not stop, we will cause a catastrophic disaster that will be difficult to bear! However, it is precisely they who, like Belikov in Chekhov's novel "The Man in a Case," wear cotton overcoats in warm weather, hold umbrellas in the sunshine, and close their eyes in fear of the growth of new things.
　　We pay no attention to this wailing, and still stride forward with full confidence, using the pace of greater leaps forward, using even more boiling enthusiasm, using even greater achievements in completing various planned targets ahead of schedule even more outstandingly, to compose a more thrilling symphony of the Great Leap Forward: "Aheadness, aheadness, and more aheadness!" "Aheadness, aheadness, and more aheadness!" It is in the sound of this unprecedentedly loud symphony that our cause is galloping forward at a thousand miles a day!

    提前曲
    黄秉忠
    各个战线上建设英雄们献给“群英会”的礼物中，最多也最好的，要算得是“提前和超额完成今年的生产指标”了。锣鼓喧天，捷报频传，到处只听得提前，提前，提前的欢呼声。
    看！这一项工程刚刚提前竣工，那一个新建工厂又提前投入了生产。听！一批单位提前完成月计划的锣声刚刚敲响，另一批单位提前完成季计划的鼓声又紧紧跟上。跃进浪潮无止境，人们总是用更大的干劲，去争取一次更比一次大的跃进。一项工程提前竣工了，就定要夺取下一项工程也提前完成；月计划、季计划提前完成了，就定要争取继续提前跨进新的一年。
    提前，提前，再提前！这是党的社会主义建设总路线点燃起来的革命热潮，这是马克思主义者的革命哲学。在民主革命时期，我们提前把半封建半殖民地的贫穷落后的旧中国，推上了走向繁荣富强的社会主义新中国的轨道；在国民经济恢复时期，我们提前医治好了被国民党反动政府无情破坏了的国民经济的严重创伤；进入社会主义建设时期以后，我们又提前完成了第一个五年计划。现在，党领导着我们正在信心百倍地为提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而英勇奋斗。我们可以自豪地、毫不隐讳地宣布：我们共产主义者正是提前主义者！
    提前，提前，再提前！这是我国社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展的必然特征。我们的事业是初升的朝阳，我们有共产党和毛主席掌握着前进的方向，有六亿多挣脱了枷锁的人民，有以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的支持……。所有这一切，汇集成了一股巨大的洪流，它正在乘风破浪地冲毁前进道上的一切障碍，朝着预定的目标，兼程前进。
    提前，提前，再提前！像春雷一样，震撼着大地，它催促着一切新生的事物快快生长，它使得一切陈旧的东西快快死亡。这一切吓昏了所有右倾机会主义分子的头脑。他们顿时惊慌失措、脸色苍白地出来指手划脚：这也不好！那也糟了！在他们看来，我们的前面就是无底深渊，再不止步就会闯下滔天大祸，灾难难当！然而，正是他们自己像契呵夫小说“装在套子里的人”中的别里科夫一样，在顶暖和的天气穿着棉大衣，在阳光下打着雨伞，闭起眼睛害怕新生事物的成长。
    我们丝毫不理会这种惨叫，依然信心百倍地阔步向前，用更大跃进的步伐，用更加沸腾的干劲，用更出色地提前完成各项计划指标的更大成绩，合奏成更加惊心动魄的大跃进的交响曲：“提前，提前，再提前”“提前，提前，再提前！”就在这亘古未有的响亮的交响曲声中，我们的事业正日行千里地向前奔驰！
