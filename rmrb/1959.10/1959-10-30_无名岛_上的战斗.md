    Battle on "Nameless Island"
    Qiu Yang
    I think the most prominent feature of this film is that within its thrilling style, it clearly contains a relatively profound philosophical point: why are we destined to win in the battle between the enemy and us, while the enemy is destined to lose?
    The situation on "Nameless Island," on the surface, is obviously unfavorable to us. We have only two people and one gun. Of the two, one is wounded, and there is also a wavering prisoner; the enemy has six people, with complete firearms and communication equipment. However, in this situation of numerical inferiority, the result of the battle is our complete victory. Why? The film answers this question without ambiguity, and not simply.
    The just and unjust nature of the war, the socialist relationship between people and the capitalist relationship of mutual deceit and oppression, are the fundamental factors determining the victory or defeat of this battle.
    The film's depiction of this profound and complex political struggle is very concise. There are only ten people and one island, but what it wants to illustrate is full and credible.
    The contrast technique is even more evident in the development of the plot, yet it doesn't feel repetitive at all, because each contrast further completes the essential task of praising heroes and exposing the enemy. Not to mention the behavior depicted at the beginning of our army ramming enemy ships with wounded torpedo boats, causing them to burn, demonstrating fearlessness and heroism, but also the relationship between people in times of adversity, which fully depicts the truth that we are bound to win and the enemy is bound to lose.
    Our people, sharing the same boat, share weal and woe, and even allow the enemies who have laid down their weapons to share the only bit of fresh water and food; while the enemy, the officers would rather wash their faces with fresh water than give it to the soldiers to quench their thirst, and they also collect the little food the soldiers have for themselves, regardless of whether the soldiers are hungry or not.
    Compared with the published literary script, the film is more distinct and reasonable in grasping the essential difference between the enemy and us and embodying the characters' personalities, especially in the handling of Sun Gui.
    Sun Gui was the enemy ship's gunner. He was captured by us and received some inspiration, but he was still in a state of wavering. While the enemy and we were facing each other, and the enemy had been unable to figure out how many people we had, he escaped, intending to return to the enemy, and the danger of immediately exposing our actual situation arose; however, on his way back, he was frightened back by witnessing the enemy's brutal treatment of subordinates. In the ensuing battle, he also played an appropriate role.
    This is a very brilliant portrayal. From the development of the plot, his departure played a role in making the situation extremely tense; however, his return best illustrates the essential difference between the enemy and our army. His choice of whether to stay or leave very centrally showed the truth that we are bound to win and the enemy is bound to lose. In this way, there is both a tense plot and distinct character development, as well as profound political content. This change is successful.
    However, I also feel a bit of regret, that is, the introduction to the geographical environment of Nameless Island is still slightly unclear. In other plays, this may be a minor detail, but in this play, it is very important, because this is precisely the important factor that caused the enemy not to understand us (and later the enemy could not figure out our bottom line).
    It is worth applauding "Nameless Island," because it not only quickly allowed us to see the heroic deeds of the naval warriors, but also allowed us to see many profound truths.

    “无名岛”上的战斗
    丘扬
    我觉得，这部片子最突出的一个特点是：在惊险的样式当中，很明确地包含着比较深刻的哲理——敌我战斗中，为什么我们是必胜的，而敌人却是必败的？
    “无名岛”上的情势，就其表面来看显然对我方不利，我们只有两个人一支枪，两个人中还有一位伤号，此外还有一个在动摇中的俘虏；敌方是六个人，枪械通讯器材俱全。然而就在这个敌众我寡的局面中，战斗的结果是我们全胜，为什么？影片在回答这个问题时毫不含糊，而且也不简单。
    战争的正义和非正义的性质、社会主义的人与人之间的关系和资本主义尔虞我诈欺上压下的关系，是决定这场战斗胜负的根本因素。
    影片在反映这个深刻复杂的政治斗争时，笔墨是很精炼的，人不过十个，地不过一岛，然而所要说明的东西却是饱满可信的。
    对比的手法，更见于情节的发展之中，然而丝毫也不使人觉得重复，因为每一个对比，都更深一步地完成着歌颂英雄、揭露敌人的本质任务。且不说在开头处所描绘的我军以负伤的鱼雷艇撞击敌舰使之焚毁的行为，表现了临危不惧，英勇无畏的气概，就在人与人之间在患难中的关系上，也使得我必胜、敌必败的真理得到充分的描绘。
    我们的人，同舟共济，祸福与共，即使对放下武器的敌人，也让他分享仅有的一点淡水和食物；而敌人却是当官的宁把淡水洗了脸，也不分给士兵解渴，还把士兵仅有的一点食物都搜罗来自己吃，管他士兵饿不饿。
    比起已发表的文学剧本说来，影片在掌握敌我的本质差别，体现人物性格上，都是更鲜明和更顺乎情理的，特别表现在对孙贵的处理上。
    孙贵是敌舰的炮长，被我们俘虏了，受到一些感召，但仍处在动摇之中。而就在敌我双方对峙，敌人一直摸不清我们到底有多少人的情况下，他逃跑了，要回到敌方去，我们的实际情况有立即暴露的危险；但他回去途中，却因为目睹敌人虐待下级之惨，又吓得跑回来了，在以后的战斗中他还起了适当的作用。
    这是很精彩的勾抹。从情节的发展上讲，他的走，起了使情势紧张异常的作用；然而，他的回，却是再好也没有地说明了敌我军队的本质区别。从他的抉择去留之中，很集中地显示了我必胜、敌必败的真理。这样，既有了紧张的情节，又有了鲜明的性格发展，更有了深刻的政治内容，这改动是成功的。
    不过，也感到有点缺憾，那就是关于无名岛地理环境的介绍还稍欠清楚。在别的戏里也许这是末节，然而在这出戏里就很重要，因为这正是造成敌我不了解（后来则是敌人摸不清我们底）的重要因素。
    值得向“无名岛”鼓掌，因为它既很迅速地让我们看到了海军战士们的英雄业迹，又使我们看到了许多深刻的道理。
