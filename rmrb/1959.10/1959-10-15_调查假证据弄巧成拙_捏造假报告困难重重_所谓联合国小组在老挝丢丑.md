　　Investigating False Evidence Backfires; Fabricating False Reports Proves Difficult
　　The So-Called UN Team Disgraced in Laos

　　(Dispatch from this newspaper) The illegally established United Nations Security Council "Sub-Committee on the Investigation of the Laotian Situation" announced on October 10th that its "investigation" mission had concluded. Some members remained in Laos, while others departed for New York on the 13th. They will submit a so-called "investigation report" to the UN Security Council. Since the false evidence fabricated by the Sananikone group to smear the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos has been exposed one by one, how to compile this "investigation report" has become a problem for the "committee."

　　The establishment of this illegal "Sub-Committee on the Investigation of the Laotian Situation" was due to the failure of the Lao Phoui Sananikone group's trick of slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "invading" Laos. The United States, at its behest, requested the United Nations to conduct an "investigation" in Laos in order to create a pretext for US imperialist armed intervention in Laos and escalating tensions in the Indochina region. Since September 15th, after more than twenty days of "investigation" activities, it not only failed to find any evidence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "invading" Laos, but also thoroughly exposed the shameful acts of the Lao Sananikone group in racking its brains to fabricate "witnesses and material evidence," thus making this "investigation" a ridiculous farce.

　　The Phoui Sananikone group desperately promoted that it could produce "Viet Minh prisoners" as evidence. To this end, it adopted despicable means such as offering huge rewards for capturing "Vietnamese people." It also sent agents and armed forces to villages to arrest people, threatening innocent villagers who were arrested with hanging, extermination of their entire family, and burning down the entire village if they confessed to being so-called "Lao combat forces personnel" trained by the "Viet Minh." Not long ago, a general of the Lao Royal Army, Anka Soukhavong, confessed: "We still don't have a single Viet Minh prisoner of war. This is our biggest problem."

　　The "prisoners" handed over by the Lao authorities to the "investigation sub-committee" for interrogation were completely fabricated. According to a report by "Lao Patriotic News" on the 6th, the Sam Neua Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently received many letters and protests from people from all walks of life, accusing the US-Sananikone group of such despicable behavior. People from a village in Xieng Khouang County wrote in a letter on September 29th: "When the Phoui Sananikone army carried out 'sweeps' in Xieng Khouang and Muang Hiem, they arrested ten people from this village and said they would take them to Sam Neua to hand them over to the United Nations 'investigation sub-committee.'"

　　A person from Xiangkhouang County who was arrested wrote a letter exposing how the Sananikone group arrested people, how they used special agents to force the arrested people to participate in "study," and threatened them with hanging and killing their entire families if they admitted during "interrogation" that they had been trained by the "Viet Minh." Even Agence France-Presse's dispatches had to admit that the "prisoners" "interrogated" by the "investigation sub-committee" during the "investigation" "did not seem to belong to regular forces," "looked very young, one of whom was less than fourteen years old," and "these prisoners were not even Lao guerrillas carrying weapons, but residents of various villages accused of cooperating with Laos." What the Phoui Sananikone group presented as "evidence" were only lengthy documents they had fabricated and so-called "captured weapons and materials" of unknown origin.

　　Although this farce of an "investigation" has been thoroughly exposed, and the "investigation sub-committee" has had to announce the "end of its mission," it seems that it has not really ended. A portion of the members and secretarial staff of this "sub-committee" continue to remain in Laos. According to the statement it issued on October 10th, the "sub-committee" personnel will remain in Laos indefinitely, saying, "We will stay as long as necessary." Recent signs indicate that US imperialism may use this illegally established "sub-committee" as a tool for sabotaging the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos and replacing the International Commission. A Reuters dispatch on October 9th said: Some Western countries are requesting the establishment of a "semi-permanent UN monitoring agency" in Laos. It is reported that Aoki Shigeo, a Japanese representative on the "sub-committee," may be the person in charge of the remaining personnel. The chairman of this "sub-committee" is Shibusawa Shinichi, the Japanese representative.

　　While using the United Nations to illegally establish the "investigation sub-committee," US imperialism has been continuously transporting military personnel and weapons into Laos, and directing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which it cobbled together, to intensify preparations for armed intervention in Laos at its recent three meetings, further expanding the civil war in Laos. This series of conspiracies by US imperialism to undermine the Geneva Accords and create tension in the Indochina region has been strongly condemned by the people of Laos and the people of Southeast Asia.

### 调查假证据弄巧成拙　捏造假报告困难重重  所谓联合国小组在老挝丢丑

　　调查假证据弄巧成拙　捏造假报告困难重重
    所谓联合国小组在老挝丢丑
    本报讯　非法成立的联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”，于10月10日宣布“调查”任务已经结束，一部分成员继续留在老挝，一部分成员已于13日启程返回纽约。他们将向联合国安理会提出所谓“调查报告”。由于萨纳尼空集团为诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝而制造的假证据已经一一被揭穿，如何编制这个“调查报告”，已经成为“委员会”的难题。
    这个非法的“调查老挝局势小组委员会”的成立，是因为老挝培·萨纳尼空集团诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的伎俩破产，美国指使它要求联合国到老挝去进行“调查”，以便为美帝国主义武装干涉老挝和加剧印度支那地区紧张局势制造借口。自从9月15日以来，经过二十多天的“调查”活动，它不仅丝毫没有找到越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的证据，反而彻底暴露了老挝萨纳尼空集团挖空心思捏造“人证物证”的种种可耻行径，从而使这次“调查”成为贻笑天下的一幕丑剧。
    培·萨纳尼空集团拼命宣传说它可以拿出“越盟俘虏”作为证据。为此，它采取了悬赏巨款捉拿“越南人”等卑鄙手段。它还派出特务和武装部队到乡村去抓人，用绞死、满门抄斩和烧光整个村庄来威胁被抓的无辜村民承认是所谓受“越盟”训练的“寮国战斗部队人员”。不久前，老挝王国军队的一个将军安卡·苏卡冯就曾供认说：“我们仍然没有一名越盟战俘。这是我们最大的问题。”
    而被老挝当局交给“调查小组委员会”去审讯的“俘虏”，完全是假造的。据“老挝爱国新闻”6日报道，老挝爱国战线党桑怒省委员会最近收到各界人民的许多来信和抗议书，控诉美国—萨纳尼空集团这种卑鄙的行为。川库县一个村庄的人民在9月29日写的一封信中说：“培·萨纳尼空军队在川库和芒艾进行‘扫荡’的时候，把这个村里的十个人抓去，并且说要把他们带到桑怒交给联合国的‘调查小组委员会’。”
    桑德县的一个被抓去的人来信揭露了萨纳尼空集团如何抓人，如何利用特务人员强迫被抓的人参加“学习”，并以绞死和全家杀光来威胁他们在受“审问”时承认受过
  “越盟”的训练。连法新社的电讯，都不得不承认“调查小组委员会”在“调查”期间“审问”的“俘虏”“似乎不是属于正规部队的”，“看上去都很年轻，其中有一个还不到十四岁”，“这些俘虏甚至还不是拿武器的寮国游击队员，而是被控告同寮国合作的各村居民”。培·萨纳尼空集团提出作为“证据”的，只是他们自己编造的冗长文件和来历不明的所谓“缴获的武器和物资”。
    这场“调查”的丑剧虽已彻底被揭穿，而“调查小组委员会”也不得不宣布“任务结束”，但是看来它还没有真正收场。这个“小组委员会”还有一部分成员和秘书人员继续留在老挝。据10月10日它所发表的声明说，“小组委员会”人员勾留老挝是没有限期的，它说：“需要留多久”就留多久。最近有迹象表明，美帝国主义有可能利用这个非法成立的“小组委员会”作为破坏恢复老挝国际委员会的活动并取代国际委员会的阴谋工具。路透社10月9日电讯说：有些西方国家正在要求在老挝设立一个“半永久性的联合国监视机构”。据报道，“小组委员会”的一个日本代表青木盛夫可能是留守人员中的负责人。而这个“小组委员会”的主席是日本代表涩泽信一。
    美帝国主义在利用联合国非法成立“调查小组委员会”的同时，不断向老挝运进军事人员和武器，并且指使它拼凑的东南亚条约集团在最近三次开会加紧准备武装干涉老挝，进一步扩大老挝的内战。美帝国主义这一连串的破坏日内瓦协议和在印度支那地区制造紧张局势的阴谋，已遭到老挝人民及东南亚人民的强烈的谴责。
