The Friendship Between the Chinese and Japanese People Must Develop
By our commentator

Following the visit to our country by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation headed by Inejiro Asanuma on March 17 of this year and the joint statement issued with Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, on October 21st, the Japanese delegation from all walks of life celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, headed by former Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama, and the Chinese seven people's organizations represented by Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, Liao Chengzhi, Cai Chang, Zhang Xiruo, Chu Tunan, and Liu Xiyuan issued a joint statement. During its stay in China, the delegation participated in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of China and visited Beijing, as well as Northeast, Southwest, and Northwest China. The head of the delegation, Tetsu Katayama, the deputy heads, Tadashi Obata, Ban Shiraishi, and Masato Honda, paid visits to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Premier Chen Yi; and held cordial talks with Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou Enlai received all members of the delegation. The delegation and the responsible persons of Chinese people's organizations such as the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the All-China Youth Federation, fully exchanged views on world peace, peaceful coexistence, Sino-Japanese friendship, promotion of non-governmental exchanges and cultural exchanges between China and Japan, and the issue of Chinese and Japanese fishing boats encountering storms in the East China Sea and taking shelter in designated seaports.

The joint statement of the Chinese seven people's organizations and the Japanese delegation from all walks of life celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China clearly stated that the people of China and Japan should join hands in promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and make contributions to eliminating the Cold War, preventing nuclear weapons wars, and maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The joint statement pointed out that in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, the Japanese people must use their own strength to free the Japanese government from American control, prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and further abolish this treaty; withdraw American troops stationed in Japan, and eliminate all military bases on Japanese territory; and realize Japan's complete independence, democratic freedom, and permanent peace and neutrality. American troops must also be completely withdrawn from the Taiwan area in order to ease the tensions in the Far East. At a time when the American reactionaries are stepping up the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, plotting to establish an open U.S.-Japan military alliance, threatening our country's security, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world, the signing and publication of this joint statement is of great significance.

The Japanese delegation from all walks of life celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was elected by more than seventy Japanese people's organizations. The joint statement reflects the urgent desire of the broad masses of Japanese people to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and restore normal relations between the two countries. It is only because the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government insists on implementing reactionary policies that violate the will of the Japanese people that the relations between the two countries are still in an extremely abnormal state. The Japanese people can no longer tolerate this state of affairs. The joint statement issued by Zhang Xiruo and Inejiro Asanuma as early as March this year pointed out the way to resolve the current deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations; condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's reactionary policy of being hostile to China, participating in the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and hindering the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations; and unanimously believed that the American and Japanese reactionaries were carrying out new military collusion, driving the Japanese people into the abyss of war, and endangering the peace of China and Asia. To achieve the above goals, the Chinese and Japanese people must join hands and fight together. This statement, as well as the joint statement between the delegation headed by Tetsu Katayama and the seven Chinese people's organizations, has played a positive role in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding world peace. Recently, the 16th Congress of the Japanese Socialist Party also passed a resolution, deciding to do everything possible to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty; and issued a declaration, calling on all members of the Japanese Socialist Party to rise up and fight to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and realize Japan's neutrality. The Chinese people support this appeal from our Socialist Party friends, which is in line with the interests of the Japanese nation.

Recently, the voices of the broad masses of the Japanese people defending peace, opposing American aggression, and improving Sino-Japanese relations have become louder and louder, resonating in all strata of Japanese society. People from all walks of life in Japan, including insightful people within the Liberal Democratic Party, are also working to change the current state of Sino-Japanese relations and restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible. Not long ago, former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, who visited our country, also stated in a joint communique with Premier Zhou Enlai that knowledgeable people in Japan "have not tolerated in the past" and "cannot tolerate in the future" the Kishi Nobusuke government's thinking and actions of following the United States, creating "two Chinas," and being hostile to the Chinese people. Ishibashi Tanzan agreed that the development of political and economic relations between the Chinese and Japanese people must be combined and cannot be divided; and stated that the greatest efforts should be made to change the unsatisfactory current situation in Japan and the existing international relations as soon as possible. Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi's visit to our country made a beneficial contribution to promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Now, Mr. Kenzo Matsumura, advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, has come to our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. Mr. Matsumura, like Mr. Ishibashi, advocates promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. Mr. Matsumura supports the joint communique issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Tanzan Ishibashi. The Chinese people welcome Mr. Matsumura's visit to China to contribute to improving Sino-Japanese relations and maintaining peace in Asia, and also hope that this visit, like Mr. Ishibashi's, will make a valuable contribution to enhancing mutual understanding and developing friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, who have a long history, cannot be destroyed by the American and Japanese reactionaries. The widespread struggle of the Japanese people against Kishi Nobusuke's policy of following the United States and being hostile to China, as well as the above-mentioned visits by people from all walks of life and politicians in Japan, all show that the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people will break through all artificial obstacles and develop further.

    中日两国人民的友好一定要发展
    本报评论员
    继今年3月17日以浅沼稻次郎为首的日本社会党代表团访问我国，并和中国人民外交学会会长张奚若发表共同声明以后；10月21日，以日本前首相片山哲为首的日本各界庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年代表团和郭沫若、刘宁一、廖承志、蔡畅、张奚若、楚图南、刘西元代表的中国七人民团体发表了共同声明。代表团在中国期间，参加了中国建国十周年庆祝典礼后，曾在北京和到东北、西南、西北地方参观。代表团团长片山哲、副团长小畑忠良、白石凡、本多正登拜会了毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和陈毅副总理；并和周恩来总理进行了亲切的会谈。周恩来总理接见了代表团全体团员。代表团同中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国妇女联合会、中国人民外交学会、中国人民对外文化协会和中华全国青年联合会等人民团体的负责人，就世界和平、和平共处，中日友好以及促进中日两国民间来往，文化交流和东黄海上中日双方渔船遭遇风暴等危险时到指定的海港避风避难等问题，充分交换了意见。
    中国七人民团体和日本各界庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年代表团的共同声明明确表示，中日两国人民应该携起手来按照和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则，促进中日关系正常化，并且为排除冷战、防止核武器战争、维护远东和世界和平作出贡献。共同声明指出，为了实现上述目的，日本人民必须用自己的力量使日本政府摆脱美国控制，阻止修改日美安全保障条约，并进一步废除这一条约；撤退美国驻在日本的军队、取消在日本领土上的一切军事基地；实现日本的完全独立、民主自由，永久的和平、中立。美国军队还必须从台湾地区全部撤退，远东的紧张局势才能得以缓和。在目前美国反动派加紧修改日美安全保障条约、阴谋建立公开的美日军事同盟、威胁我国安全、威胁远东和世界和平的形势下，这一共同声明的签署和发布是有着重大的意义的。
    日本各界庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年代表团，是由日本七十多个人民团体推选出来的。共同声明反映了日本广大人民对促进中日两国人民友好、恢复中日两国正常关系的迫切愿望。只是由于日本岸信介政府坚持执行违反日本人民意志的反动政策，两国关系至今处于极不正常的状态中。日本人民对于这种状态再也不能容忍下去了。张奚若和浅沼稻次郎早在今年3月发表的共同声明，就指出了解决目前中日关系僵局的途径；谴责了岸信介政府敌视中国、参加美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋、阻挠中日关系正常化的反动政策；并一致认为美日反动派进行新的军事勾结、把日本人民驱向战争深渊、危害中国和亚洲的和平。为实现上述目标，中日人民必须携起手来，共同奋斗。这一声明和以片山哲为首的代表团同我国七人民团体的共同声明，同样地对促进中日友好和保卫世界和平起了积极的作用。最近，日本社会党第十六次代表大会又通过决议，决定全力阻止修改日美安全保障条约；并发表宣言，号召日本社会党全体党员为阻止修改日美“安全条约”、争取恢复日中邦交和实现日本的中立而奋起斗争。中国人民支持社会党朋友们的这一符合日本民族利益的呼吁。
    最近以来，日本广大人民保卫和平、反对美国侵略、改善中日关系的呼声已一天比一天高昂，在日本社会各阶层中都引起了共鸣。日本各界人士包括自由民主党内部的有识之士，也在为改变中日两国关系的现状、早日恢复两国的正常关系而努力。不久以前，来我国访问的日本前首相石桥湛山在同周恩来总理发表的会谈公报中也表示，日本有见识的人士对岸信介政府追随美国、制造“两个中国”与中国人民为敌的思想和行动，“过去未曾容忍”、“今后也是不能容忍的”。石桥湛山同意中日两国人民政治和经济关系的发展必须结合起来不能予以分割；并表示，应该尽最大努力对于有不能令人满意之处的日本现状和现存的国际关系，早日加以改变。石桥湛山先生这次访问我国，对促进中日两国人民的友好，是作出了有益的贡献的。
    现在，日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三先生又应周恩来总理的邀请，来到我国进行友好访问。松村先生和石桥先生一样，是主张促进中日友好、保卫远东和世界和平的。对于周恩来总理和石桥湛山发表的会谈公报，松村先生是支持的。中国人民欢迎松村先生这次访问中国能对改善中日关系和维护亚洲和平作出贡献，也希望通过这次访问，和石桥先生同样地对增进中日两国人民间的相互了解和友好关系的发展作出宝贵的贡献。
    我们坚定的相信，具有悠久历史的中日两国人民之间的友谊，不是美日反动派所能破坏的。日本人民为反对岸信介追随美国、敌视中国的政策而进行的广泛斗争以及上述日本各界人士和政治家的来访，都说明中日两国人民的友好关系必将冲破一切人为的障碍而得到进一步的发展。（附图片）
