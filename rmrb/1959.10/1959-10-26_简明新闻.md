Brief News

	Collecting Tree Seeds
	The Party committees at all levels in the Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Region of Inner Mongolia arranged seed collection work when the tree seeds were about to mature. The broad masses of commune members, employees' families, employees, and students have set off a high tide of seed collection. Workers engaged in felling, gathering, and transporting timber have also launched a "no empty-handed" movement.
	By mid-October, more than 34,000 kilograms of pure seeds of Dahurian larch, Scots pine, white birch, black birch, oak, hazel, and other trees had been collected, overfulfilling the annual seed collection plan.

	Balanced Pig Raising
	The Suqiao People's Commune in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, develops pig production in a planned and balanced manner. Based on the law that sows give birth to two litters a year, they classify and rank all sows, use artificial control, and mate them in batches and in rotation to implement planned and balanced development. In March of this year, they achieved daily births of piglets every month, with 50 to 60 piglets born every day, changing the previous situation of one period in the first half of the year and one period in the second half of the year.

	Storing Grain and Grass for Pigs
	Songjiang County in Shanghai has launched a mass movement to collect and store feed. As of early October, the county had ensiled and dried more than 310 million catties of feed. Based on the average number of pigs, each pig has stored more than 2,000 catties, enough for half a year of "grain and grass" for this winter and next spring.
	The county is now continuing to push this upsurge forward, preparing to work hard for fifteen days, and striving to complete and overfulfill the task of 500 million catties of silage feed.

	High Yield of Hongyu Apples
	The Deli Temple Production Farm in Fuxian County, a local state-owned enterprise in Liaoning, has achieved high yields in its Hongyu apple experimental fields, breaking the theory that "Hongyu apples have low yields." This year, the average yield of Hongyu apples in the experimental fields reached 14,630.9 catties per mu, and the highest reached 17,006 catties per mu.
