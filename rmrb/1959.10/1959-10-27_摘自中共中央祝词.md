Man is the most active factor in the productive forces. The masses of the people are the creators of history. Whether it is revolution or construction, only by mobilizing the masses of the people most extensively and giving the fullest play to their enthusiasm and creativity can we achieve victory most rapidly and thoroughly. The reason why our country has been able to develop its national economy at a speed unmatched by all capitalist countries in the past ten years, especially in the last two years, and has achieved unprecedented achievements in the history of our country, is, in the final analysis, the great victory of the mass movement led by the Party and the great victory of the Party's mass line.

    人是生产力的最积极的因素。人民群众是历史的创造者。无论是革命或者建设，唯有最广泛地动员人民群众，最充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，才能最迅速、最彻底地取得胜利。我国在过去十年中特别是最近两年中之所以能够以所有资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度发展国民经济，获得了我国历史上空前未有的成就，归根到底，是党所领导的群众运动的伟大胜利，是党的群众路线的伟大胜利。
