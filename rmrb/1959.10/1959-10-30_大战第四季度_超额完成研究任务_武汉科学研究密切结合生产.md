	Great Battle in the Fourth Quarter: Exceeding Research Tasks
	Wuhan Scientific Research Closely Integrated with Production
	(Our Wuhan Dispatch, October 29) Under the situation of continued leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, scientific research units in the Wuhan area are more closely integrating with actual production, and are launching a "great battle in the fourth quarter to overfulfill the annual scientific research tasks."
	Based on the various problems currently emerging in industrial and agricultural production, various scientific research units have made arrangements according to their respective specialties. In industry, relevant research institutes have strengthened scientific and technological research work in steel production, mechanical casting, etc., to assist production units in solving key problems in current steel production and mechanical casting. In agriculture, relevant research units have sent a large number of scientists to delve into the communes, conscientiously summarize the high-yield experiences of cotton, rice, sesame, peanuts, etc., and prepare to systematically summarize the high-yield technologies of major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, and oil, in order to improve agricultural production technology next year. Various relevant scientific research units are also cooperating with winter agricultural production, water conservancy, fertilizers, tool reforms, and diversified operations, strengthening scientific research activities. In addition to conscientiously summarizing the masses' experiences in building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and reforming tools, they are also concentrating their efforts on researching chemical fertilizers, new agricultural tools, and the utilization of wild plants, helping rural areas improve technology and develop diversified operations. The scientific workers in the various research institutes are all highly enthusiastic. Although the Agricultural Science Research Institute has transferred a large number of staff to the countryside for investigation and summary work, the small number of staff remaining in the institute have voluntarily undertaken the systematic analysis and summary work of various crops. They are determined to overcome difficulties with the spirit of hard work and clever work, doing the work of two people with one person, and completing the annual scientific research plan.
	Since the beginning of this year, scientific research units in the Wuhan area have conscientiously implemented the policy of scientific research serving production, and have achieved remarkable results. Many scientific research workers have thoroughly changed the past habit of conducting experiments behind closed doors and finding topics in books, and have begun to delve into production units such as communes and factories, combining with industrial and agricultural production, and the results of research work have been very significant. According to statistics from the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from January to September alone, 254 scientific research projects have been completed, accounting for more than 80% of the annual plan, most of which were carried out in conjunction with actual production.
	Since August and September, the Party's call for anti-rightist sentiment and encouraging vigor has further inspired scientific workers, and a new situation has also emerged in Wuhan's scientific community. Scientific workers are more enthusiastic and energetic in serving production. Problems that were previously considered unsolvable for a long time have also been solved due to boosting energy and fully utilizing the wisdom of the masses. When the Surveying and Mapping Research Institute encountered the difficulty of welding quartz filaments with metal when trial-producing a small gravimeter with high precision, no progress was made after 40 days of research. However, under the Party's call to combat right-leaning tendencies and encourage hard work, they improved their working methods, convened a "Zhuge Liang Meeting," and fully utilized the strength of all members of the group, and the problem was quickly solved. The small gravimeter was successfully trial-produced, and the quality also met the specifications, shattering the erroneous arguments of a few people that "scientific research cannot be fast and good at the same time, and if it is to be good, it cannot be fast." Many research units conscientiously implemented the mass line and carried out communist large-scale collaboration. The units under the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences alone have established cooperative relationships with hundreds of relevant production units, schools, etc., and working methods have been continuously improved. Therefore, many units completed a quarter's work in September, achieving fruitful scientific research results. These have laid the foundation for the scientific community's great battle in the fourth quarter and found a way to develop the scientific cause faster and better.

    大战第四季度　超额完成研究任务
    武汉科学研究密切结合生产
    本报武汉29日电　在工农业生产继续跃进的形势下，武汉地区科学研究单位更紧密地结合生产实际，正在掀起一个“大战第四季度，超额完成全年科学研究任务”的热潮。
    各科学研究单位根据当前工农业生产出现的各种问题，分别结合自己的专业进行了安排。在工业方面，有关的研究所加强了钢铁生产、机械铸造等科学技术研究工作，协助生产单位解决当前钢铁生产和机械铸造中的关键性问题。在农业方面，有关的研究单位派出了大批科学家深入公社，认真总结棉花、水稻、芝麻、花生等丰产经验，准备对稻、麦、棉、油等主要农作物的丰产技术进行系统的总结，以便用来改进明年的农业生产技术。各有关科学研究单位还配合冬季农业生产、水利、肥料、工具改革和多种经营等，加强了科学研究活动，除了认真总结群众兴修水利、积肥、工具改革等经验外，还集中力量对化学肥料、新式农具和野生植物的利用进行了研究。帮助农村改良技术和发展多种经营生产。各研究所的科学工作者工作情绪都很高涨，农业科学研究所虽然抽调了大批工作人员下乡调查总结，留在所内的少部分工作人员自动地担任了各种作物的系统分析总结工作，他们决心以苦干巧干的精神来克服困难，一人作二人工作，完成全年的科学研究计划。
    今年以来，武汉地区科学研究单位认真贯彻科学为生产服务的方针，并且取得了显著的成绩。许多科学研究工作者彻底地改变了过去关门搞试验、从书本上找题目的习惯，开始深入到公社、工厂等生产单位，与工、农生产相结合，研究工作成绩十分显著。仅据中国科学院武汉分院一到九月份统计，已完成科学研究项目二百五十四项，占全年计划的80％以上，其中绝大部分是结合生产实际进行的。
    8、9月以来，党的反右倾、鼓干劲的号召进一步鼓舞了科学工作者，武汉科学界也出现了崭新的局面。科学工作者为生产服务热情更加高涨，干劲更足了，过去认为长期不能解决的问题，也由于鼓足干劲，充分发挥群众智慧获得了解决。测量制图研究所在试制精密度较高的小型重力仪时，曾遇到石英丝与金属焊接的难题，研究了四十天没有进展，但在党的反右倾、鼓干劲号召下，他们改进了工作方法，召开了“诸葛亮会”，充分发挥全组人员的力量，就很快地得到了解决，试制成功了小型重力仪，质量也合乎规格，粉碎了少部分人的所谓“科学研究要快不能好，要好不能快”的错误论调。许多研究单位认真贯彻群众路线，开展了共产主义大协作，仅中国科学院武汉分院所属各单位就和有关的成百个生产单位、学校等建立了协作关系，工作方法不断得到改进。因此，不少单位在9月内完成了一个季度的工作，取得丰硕的科学研究成果。这些都为科学界大战第四季度打下了基础，为更快更好地发展科学事业找到了途径。
