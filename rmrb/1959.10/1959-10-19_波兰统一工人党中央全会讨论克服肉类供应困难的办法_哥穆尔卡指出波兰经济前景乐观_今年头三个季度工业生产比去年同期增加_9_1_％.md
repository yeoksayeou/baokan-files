Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 18th: According to a Polish Press Agency report on the 17th, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held its third plenary session on the 17th, discussing the difficult situation in the meat market and ways to overcome these difficulties.

　　The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, delivered a report on this issue at the meeting.

　　After discussion, the plenary session passed a corresponding resolution.

　　In his report, Gomulka analyzed the difficult situation in the meat market and talked about the domestic economic situation. He said that our prospects are very optimistic. With a significant increase in people's purchasing power, the supply of daily necessities, except for meat, is generally satisfactory.

　　He pointed out that contrary to the clamoring of the enemies of socialism and people's Poland, bourgeois newspaper reporters, and traitors of the motherland acting as Western pawns, our economy is built on a healthy foundation and is constantly developing. In the first three quarters of this year, industrial production increased by 9.1% compared with the same period last year.

　　When talking about measures to solve the problem of insufficient meat supply, Gomulka said that people should consume according to production. He said that the basic principle of Poland's economic policy is to consistently maintain a trade surplus.

　　He suggested increasing the prices of meat, animal fats, and other meat products by an average of 25%; the prices of other food and industrial products remain unchanged.

　　Gomulka emphasized that we are now eliminating, and will continue to eliminate in the future, all obstacles hindering our development. We are now and will continue to be closely linked with the working class and the working people to achieve this.

　　波兰统一工人党中央全会讨论克服肉类供应困难的办法
    哥穆尔卡指出波兰经济前景乐观
    今年头三个季度工业生产比去年同期增加9.1％
    新华社华沙18日电　据波兰通讯社17日报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会17日举行了第三次全体会议，讨论了肉类市场上的困难情况和克服这些困难的办法。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在会上就这一问题作了报告。
    经过讨论后，全体会议通过了相应的决议。
    哥穆尔卡在报告中分析了肉类市场上的困难情况，并谈到了国内的经济形势。他说，我们的前景非常乐观。在人民的购买力有很大提高的情况下，日用必需品的供应，除了肉类以外，一般是令人满意的。
    他指出，同社会主义和人民波兰的敌人、资产阶级报刊的记者以及充当西方走卒的祖国叛徒的叫嚷相反，我们的经济建立在健康的基础上，并且正在不断发展。在今年的头三个季度，工业生产比去年同期增加了9.1％。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到解决肉类供应不足问题的措施时说，人们应当根据产量来消费。他说，波兰经济政策的基本原则是经常保持贸易顺差。
    他建议将肉类、动物油脂和其他肉制品的价格平均提高25％；其他食品和工业品的价格照旧不变。
    哥穆尔卡强调说，我们现在正在消除、而且将来还要继续消除一切阻碍我们发展的障碍。我们现在和将来都密切同工人阶级、同劳动人民的联系，以实现这一点。
