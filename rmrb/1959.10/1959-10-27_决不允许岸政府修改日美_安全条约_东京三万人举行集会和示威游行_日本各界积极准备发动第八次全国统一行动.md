Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch from Tokyo: As the Japanese Diet convened its extraordinary session today, 30,000 people from various circles in Japan held a rally in Tokyo, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "enterprise rationalization" involving massive layoffs of coal miners.

The rally was jointly organized by the National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 organizations, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo).

The resolution unanimously adopted at the rally stated that the Japanese people will absolutely not allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to aggravate international tensions in Asia.

The resolution demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government halt negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," cease its hostile policy towards China, and abandon its plan to transport "Sidewinder" missiles into Japan.

The resolution also demanded that the United States halt its plan to conduct "Nike-Hercules" missile launching exercises on Okinawa and withdraw U.S. troops from Okinawa.

The resolution expressed the Japanese working class's determination to hold a strike in the Eighth National Unified Action against the "Security Treaty" to be held on November 27.

The resolution also expressed resolute opposition to the massive layoffs of coal miners, the implementation of a "performance appraisal" system for teachers, and rising living costs, and strive for a nationally unified minimum wage of 8,000 yen per month.

The rally also unanimously adopted a declaration. The declaration emphasized that at this critical moment when the nation's destiny is at stake, the working class is determined to strive with all its might for peace, neutrality, democracy, and improved living standards.

When speaking at the mass rally, Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to revise the "Security Treaty" as running counter to the general trend of the world, and called on the people of the whole country to make active efforts in the struggle to change the government's foreign policy.

Central Committee Member of the Japanese Communist Party, Ichizo Suzuki, called on all democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, to unite and rescue the Japanese people from the national crisis.

Akira Kazami, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, said that history teaches us that if the people of the whole country stand up in anger, the government cannot be maintained. He also said: "Let us promote our struggle with confidence and smash the 'Security Treaty,' the root of all national disasters."

After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration in Tokyo. Leading the march were coal miners wearing miner's lamps.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th Dispatch from Tokyo: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" decided at its steering committee meeting on the 24th to fully launch preparations in order to launch the Eighth National Unified Action on November 27.

The meeting decided to strengthen propaganda work, post five million slogans across the country, and organize as many lectures as possible by its member organizations. It also decided to hold a mass rally including representatives from all walks of life on November 1 in order to expand the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" among all strata of the country.

The various member organizations of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are currently strengthening preparations in order to ensure the victory of the Eighth National Unified Action. The Women's Agreement to Protect National Human Rights is conducting propaganda work among women workers, including those from the All Japan Trade Union Conference (which is not a member of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"). The Japan Mothers' Congress Liaison Committee will also submit a petition to the Diet requesting the cessation of negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" on November 30.

The "Farmers Liaison Council to Implement Farmers' Demands and Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" (composed of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and other farmers' groups) is organizing farmer struggles in agricultural areas. As of the 24th, twenty-five localities in thirteen prefectures had decided to hold farmers' conferences in November. A signature campaign among farmers against the revision of the "Security Treaty" will also be launched in the near future. (Attached picture)

    新华社26日讯　东京消息：今天在日本国会临时会议开幕的时候，日本各界共三万人在东京举行大会，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”和实行大批解雇煤矿工人的“企业合理化”。
    这次大会是由一百四十多个团体组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议和日本工会总评议会主持举行的。
    大会一致通过的决议说，日本人民决不允许岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”来加剧亚洲的国际紧张局势。
    决议要求岸信介政府停止关于修改“安全条约”的谈判，停止敌视中国的政策和放弃把“响尾蛇式”导弹运入日本的计划。
    决议还要求美国停止在冲绳岛进行“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹的发射演习的计划，并且把美军撤出冲绳岛。
    决议表示日本工人阶级决心要在11月27日举行的第八次反对“安全条约”全国统一行动中举行罢工。

    大会还一致通过了宣言。宣言强调说，工人阶级决心在国家命运处于危急的重要关头，全力争取和平、中立、民主和改善生活。
    社会党主席铃木茂三郎在群众大会上讲话时谴责岸信介政府修改“安全条约”的企图是同世界的总趋势背道而驰的，并且号召全国人民在争取改变政府外交政策的斗争中作出积极的努力。
    日本共产党中央干部会委员铃木市藏号召包括共产党和社会党在内的一切民主力量团结起来，把日本人民从民族危机中拯救出来。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章说，历史教导我们，如果全国人民愤怒地站起来的话，政府是不能维持下去的。他又说：“让我们满怀信心地推动我们的斗争，把作为一切民族灾难的根源‘安全条约’打得粉碎。”
    散会后，大会参加者们在东京市内举行示威游行。走在游行队伍最前面的是头戴矿灯的煤矿工人。
