    Developing Beekeeping
    The beekeeping industry in Keqeda Farm, Huocheng County, Xinjiang, has developed rapidly. The farm had only 50 beehives two years ago, but now it has increased to more than 400. This year, in order to support the development of beekeeping in the People's Communes, Keqeda Farm has transferred more than 300 of its bee colonies to the People's Communes in Huocheng County; at the same time, it has also donated a batch of honey and beehives to the communes for beekeeping purposes.

    发展养蜂
    新疆霍城县可克达农场养蜂业发展很快，该场二年前只有五十多只蜂箱，现已增加到了四百多箱。今年可克达农场为了支援人民公社发展养蜂业，已将自己的蜂种出让三百余箱给霍城县各人民公社；同时还把一批蜂蜜、蜂箱赠送给公社以供养蜂使用。
