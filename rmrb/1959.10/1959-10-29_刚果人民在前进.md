    The Congolese People Are Moving Forward
    Tao Kai
    Since the large-scale struggle against colonial rule erupted in the Congo at the beginning of January this year, the national revolutionary forces in the Congo have developed, the people's awareness has increased, and unity has been strengthened. Their struggle for independence and freedom has been continuous.
    According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the half-year from mid-January to mid-July alone, there were more than 30 large-scale mass demonstrations, strikes, protest rallies, and clashes between the military police and the people in various parts of the Congo. In June, when the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, Van Hemelryck, went to the Congo, almost every city he visited was met with organized demonstrations and protests by the local people. The Belgian news agency had to admit that the Congolese people's anti-colonial sentiment was still in a "boiling state." In Lower Congo, the focus of the struggle against colonial rule at the beginning of this year, the growth of people's power has been even faster. The Senegalese weekly "New Africa" recently reported that the entire Lower Congo region is in a state of non-violent rebellion. Everything from Europe is rejected without exception. Belgian power is ineffective everywhere: residents refuse to attend any gatherings and boycott all elections held to establish local administrative organizations. Even in the Falls region, local police require armed protection, and some city authorities have begun to doubt the reliability of local police. Not long ago, an official wrote in his report, "In Central Congo and Lower Congo, we are in danger of being drawn into an Algerian-style war." The rapid growth and strengthening of national revolutionary forces is the result of the Congolese people's continuous strengthening of unity and the active participation of the Congolese working class in the struggle.
    After the national anti-colonial rule struggle at the beginning of this year came to an end, many political parties sprang up like mushrooms after rain in the Congo. From April 10th to 12th, the Congolese National Movement, the Congolese Alliance, the Congolese Democratic Party, and other African political parties held their first joint conference in Luluabourg. The meeting unanimously demanded the establishment of a Congolese government in 1961. In a memorandum to the Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, Van Hemelryck, and the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo on June 24, ten Congolese political parties explicitly demanded that general elections be held in 1961 and then an independent Congolese government be established. The leaders of several major Congolese parties all regarded strengthening national unity and opposing the colonial government's divisive conspiracy as an important task of struggle.
    The development of the Congolese workers' movement is another important factor in the vigorous development of the national independence movement. The Congo has more than 1.14 million wage earners, second only to the Union of South Africa, and is the country with the largest number of employees in the sub-Saharan region. Among these more than one million workers, almost half are employed in modern industrial and mining enterprises. However, for a long time, because the Congolese trade union organizations have been controlled and influenced by the Belgian colonial forces, the Congo has not been a country where the workers' movement is active. In the large-scale anti-colonial rule struggle at the beginning of this year, the Congolese workers were tempered and improved, and urgently demanded the establishment of their own trade union organizations. At the end of April, they established the first African workers' organization in Leopoldville, the "Congolese National Workers' Union." Since then, the Congolese workers' movement has seen a significant upsurge. On October 5, more than 10,000 African workers in the Congolese transportation sector held their first organized large-scale strike, forcing the colonial authorities to agree to their demand for increased wages.
    With the rising tide of the Congolese national independence movement, the Belgian colonial authorities have fallen into a dilemma.
    For several months, the Belgian colonial authorities have been carrying out bloody suppression of the Congolese people on the one hand, and repeatedly making promises of so-called "political reforms" on the other. Following the Belgian government's statement on January 13 that it "allows the Congo to move towards independence," a series of decrees were issued in April and August announcing that it would "expand the powers and functions of mayors," "develop news agencies," "end racial discrimination," and "guarantee freedom of speech, assembly, and association." However, these promises have failed to deceive the Congolese people, and the national independence movement has continued to develop by leaps and bounds, while sharp contradictions have erupted within the Belgian ruling group as a result. Several ministers, led by Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny, representing the interests of the local colonial group in the Congo, believe that the method of "political reform" cannot permanently protect Belgium's colonial interests, and therefore firmly oppose any "concessions" in politics. In June, this contradiction had become public. Not long ago, the Belgian government had to hold three cabinet meetings in a row to specifically discuss the Congo issue. On September 2, Van Hemelryck was forced to resign, and De Schrijver, who represented the interests of the local colonial group in the Congo, took over as Minister of Colonial Affairs.
    As soon as De Schrijver came to power, he immediately strengthened the bloody suppression of the Congolese people. In one suppression of petitioning workers in late September alone, the colonial military police killed and injured more than 180 people. In mid-October, the colonial authorities again created ethnic disputes in the Lower Congo region, taking the opportunity to massacre African people. The colonial authorities' frenzied suppression activities were met with resolute resistance from the Congolese people. Five leaders of the ABAKO party and the African Solidarity Party lodged a solemn protest in a letter to De Schrijver. They wrote in the letter: "It is useless for you to stubbornly insist on taking these measures and imposing threats and intimidation." "Our people want to fight for independence at all costs, and January 1960 is the date of independence we are fighting for." Lumumba, the chairman of the influential Congolese National Movement, wrote in an open letter that the policy pursued by the new minister may make the Congo another Algeria. He said, "The Congolese National Movement cannot agree to the dangerous policy of Belgium's forever maintaining control and exploitation." People in many regions of the Congo have also held rallies, demonstrations, and strikes to protest the Belgian authorities' colonial rule and bloody suppression. The whole situation is in intense turmoil.
    Under this situation, the Belgian authorities once again raised the banner of so-called "political reform." On October 16, Belgian Colonial Affairs Minister De Schrijver announced a so-called phased "independence" plan for the Congo. According to his plan, the Congo will gain "independence" in 1964. This so-called "independent" Congo will have a governor-general as president, and his position will not be "transferred by a vote of the two houses." Moreover, even if "independent," the Congo cannot "separate" from Belgium, and a so-called "joint system" should be established between the two countries. The deceptive nature of this plan is obvious. Because even if this plan is fully implemented, the current colonial status of the Congo will not change in the slightest, and all power will still be in the hands of the colonial authorities. De Schrijver's so-called "independence" is just a new form of colonial rule.
    From violent suppression to political deception, then to violent suppression, and then to political deception, this is the method that the Belgian colonialists have repeatedly used in the past few months. This repetition fully reflects the weakness and incompetence of Belgian colonial rule and the growing strength of the Congolese people's anti-colonial rule struggle. The Congolese people have been tempered and become stronger in this struggle against violent suppression and political deception. At present, the Congolese people are rising up to oppose De Schrijver's plan and boycott the municipal "elections" to be held in December. The Belgian colonial authorities announced menacingly that if the Congolese people continue to boycott the "elections," it will take measures to "maintain order." But this still cannot scare the Congolese people, and new anti-colonial rule struggles have unfolded in many regions. As the date of the "elections" approaches, the struggle will become more and more intense, and a new storm of the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle is faintly visible.

    刚果人民在前进
    陶恺
    今年1月初刚果暴发大规模的反对殖民统治的斗争以来，刚果民族革命力量有了发展，人民的觉悟更加提高，团结日益加强。他们争取独立自由的斗争，此起彼伏，从未间断。
    据极不完全的统计，仅1月中旬到7月中旬半年内，刚果各地发生大规模的群众示威游行、罢工、抗议集会和军警冲突事件即达三十起以上。6月间，比利时的刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣范埃梅里克去刚果时，几乎每到一个城市，都引起当地群众有组织的示威和抗议。比利时通讯社不得不承认，刚果人民反对殖民主义的情绪，仍然处于“沸腾状态”。在今年年初反对殖民统治斗争的重点地区——下刚果，人民力量的成长更迅速。塞内加尔出版的“新非洲”周刊最近报道说，人们发现整个下刚果地区都处在非暴力叛乱状态中。一切来自欧洲的东西都无例外地遭到拒绝。比利时的权力到处行不通：居民们拒绝参加任何集会，抵制为建立地方行政组织而进行的各种选举。甚至在瀑布地区，地方警察都要求武装人员保护，而某些城市当局也开始怀疑地方警察的可靠性。不久以前一个官员在他的报告中写道，“在中刚果和下刚果，我们有卷入一场阿尔及利亚式战争的危险”。民族革命力量迅速成长壮大，是刚果人民不断加强团结、刚果工人阶级积极参加斗争的结果。
    今年年初，全国性的反对殖民统治斗争告一段落以后，刚果曾经像雨后春笋一样建立了许多政党。4月10日到12日，刚果民族运动党、刚果联盟、刚果民主党等非洲人政党在路路阿堡举行了第一次联合大会。会议一致要求在1961年成立刚果人政府。6月24日十个刚果政党在致比利时殖民事务大臣范埃梅里克和比属刚果总督的备忘录中，明确提出1961年举行普选然后成立独立的刚果政府的要求。几个刚果主要党派的领导人都把加强民族团结、反对殖民政府的分化阴谋作为一项重要斗争任务。
    刚果工人运动的发展，是民族独立运动蓬勃发展的另一个重要因素。刚果工资收入者共达一百一十四万多人，仅次于南非联邦，是撒哈拉沙漠以南地区职工人数最多的国家。在这一百多万工人中，几乎有一半是受雇于近代工矿企业的。但是，长期以来由于刚果的工会组织一直受到比利时殖民势力的控制和影响，刚果并不是工人运动活跃的国家。在今年初的大规模反殖民统治斗争中，刚果工人得到了锻炼和提高，迫切要求成立自己的工会组织。4月末，他们在利奥波德维尔成立了第一个非洲工人组织——“刚果全国工人联合会”。此后，刚果的工人运动有了显著高涨。10月5日，刚果交通运输部门一万多名非洲工人并举行了第一次有组织的大规模的罢工，迫使殖民当局同意他们增加工资的要求。
    随着刚果民族独立运动的高涨，比利时殖民当局已经陷入了进退维谷的困境。
    几个月来，比利时殖民当局一方面对刚果人民不断进行血腥的镇压，另一方面也多次提出了进行所谓“政治改革”的诺言。继1月13日比利时政府发表“容许刚果走向独立”的声明以后，在4月和8月间发布了一连串法令，宣布要“扩大市长权力和职能”、“发展新闻机构”、“结束种族歧视”、“保证言论、集会、结社自由”。但是，这些诺言并未能欺骗刚果人民，民族独立运动继续大步发展，而比利时统治集团内部却因此爆发了尖锐矛盾。以比利时外交大臣维涅为首的代表刚果当地殖民集团利益的几个大臣，认为“政治改革”的手法并不能永保比利时的殖民利益，因此坚决反对政治上的任何“让步”。6月间，这一矛盾已经趋于公开化。不久前，比利时政府曾不得不连续召开三次内阁会议专门讨论刚果问题。9月2日，范埃梅里克被迫辞职，由代表刚果当地殖民集团利益的德舒里弗就任殖民事务大臣。
    德舒里弗一上台就立即加强了对刚果人民的血腥镇压。仅9月下旬一次镇压请愿工人的事件中，殖民军警就杀伤了一百八十多人。10月中旬，殖民当局又在下刚果地区制造种族纠纷，乘机大肆屠杀非洲人民。殖民当局的疯狂镇压活动遭到了刚果人民坚决反击。阿巴科党和非洲团结党的五位领袖在写给德舒里弗的信中，义正词严地提出了抗议。他们在信中写道：“你顽固地硬要采取这些措施以及施加威胁和恐吓，都是无济于事的”。“我国人民要不惜代价争取独立，1960年1月就是我们所争取的独立的日子”。有影响的刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴在一封公开信中写道：这位新大臣奉行的政策，可能使刚果成为又一个阿尔及利亚。他表示，“刚果民族运动党不能同意比利时的永远保持控制和剥削制度的危险政策”。刚果许多地区人民也纷纷举行了集会、示威、罢工，抗议比利时当局的殖民统治和血腥镇压。整个局势处于激烈的动荡中。
    在这种形势下，比利时当局又再度抬出了所谓“政治改革”的幌子来。10月16日，比利时殖民事务大臣德舒里弗发表了一个所谓刚果分阶段“独立”计划。按照他的计划，1964年刚果将获得“独立”。这个所谓“独立的”刚果，将由总督担任总统，他的职务将不“随两院投票为转移”。而且，即使“独立”，刚果也不能和比利时“分离”，两个国家之间应当建立所谓“联合制度”。这个计划的欺骗性是显而易见的。因为，即使这个计划全部实现，刚果目前的殖民地地位也不会有丝毫变化，一切大权将仍然操在殖民当局手中。德舒里弗所谓“独立”，只不过是殖民统治的新形式罢了。
    从暴力镇压到政治欺骗、再到暴力镇压，然后又进行政治欺骗，这就是最近短短几个月来比利时殖民主义者所反复使用的手法。这一反复，充分反映了比利时殖民统治的虚弱无能和刚果人民反殖民统治斗争力量的壮大发展。刚果人民从这一反对暴力镇压和政治欺骗的斗争中，得到了锻炼，变得更加坚强起来。目前，刚果人民正在纷纷起来反对德舒里弗的计划，抵制12月即将举行的市镇“选举”。比利时殖民当局杀气腾腾地宣布，假如刚果人民继续抵制“选举”，那么它将要采取措施来“维护秩序”。但这依然吓不倒刚果人民，许多地区展开了新的反殖民统治斗争。随着“选举”日期的临近，斗争将越来越为激烈，刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的新风暴隐约可见。
