Xinhua News Agency, 9th - Ben Youssef Ben Khedda, head of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation, told Xinhua reporters today: The Algerian people's war for national liberation over the past five years has proven that France is militarily incapable and unable to defeat the Algerian people. This war will enter its sixth year this November.

    In an interview with Xinhua reporters, he said that the Algerian People's Liberation War is a revolutionary war. It is also a war relying on the people. This explains why the enemy, concentrating powerful forces and with the support of other Western imperialist countries, especially US imperialism, has failed to achieve victory.

    After summarizing the failures of the French government in military, political, and economic fields, Head of Delegation Ben Youssef Ben Khedda pointed out that all this forced De Gaulle to issue the September 16th statement. He pointed out that De Gaulle's statement still ignores the existence of the Algerian nation and the Algerian people's desire for national independence. "Therefore, the Algerian people, who urgently demand to control their own destiny and manage their own political and economic affairs, will not consider such a statement at all. They will continue to fight for liberation and national independence, no matter how long this struggle lasts."

    He emphasized that the Algerian people are seeking peace, but they are not seeking peace within the colonial system, nor peace imposed by French imperialism, but a free, democratic peace, a peace that respects their independence and dignity.

    He told reporters that French imperialism had recently concentrated 80,000 to 100,000 troops in a specific area of central Algeria in an attempt to wipe out a National Liberation Army unit of only over 400 people in the area, but this conspiracy failed shamefully. At the same time, French imperialism politically attempted to incorporate Algeria into the French Community and issued the so-called "Constantine Plan" in an attempt to divert the Algerian people's attention from the revolution, but this trick also failed without exception.

    When talking about another conspiracy of French imperialism – attempting to transfer Saharan natural resources to foreign capital, Head of Delegation Ben Youssef Ben Khedda said: The Algerian people do not recognize any agreements between the French government and Western capital regarding the Sahara.

    Head of Delegation Ben Youssef Ben Khedda enthusiastically talked about the delegation's visits to Northeast China and Beijing. He said: "We have seen that the Chinese people have made great progress in industry, agriculture, and cultural education. All this proves that the Great Leap Forward led by Chairman Mao Zedong has achieved brilliant success. In the factories, we saw the workers working enthusiastically because they believed they were working for the people."

    He said that the Chinese people's communes themselves are a revolutionary action, which is related to the lives of more than 500 million people. The delegation saw in the communes that agricultural production and the living standards of the farmers have been improved. He said that in less than a year, two Algerian Provisional Government delegations and a military delegation have visited China, which proves that the friendship between the two governments and peoples is growing day by day.

    Head of Delegation Ben Youssef Ben Khedda finally expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their warm reception of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation. He said that this reception is also a support and sympathy for the Algerian people who are fighting for national independence.

    本·优素福·本·赫达团长在京发表谈话
    阿尔及利亚人民决心斗争直到胜利
    中国的大跃进已取得了辉煌的成就
    新华社9日讯　阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团团长本·优素福·本·赫达今天对新华社记者说：五年来阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的战争已经证明，法国在军事上是没有能力也不可能战胜阿尔及利亚人民的。到今年11月，这场战争将进入第六周年。
    他在新华社记者的一次访问中说，阿尔及利亚人民解放战争是革命的战争。也是依靠人民的战争。这就说明为什么敌人集中了强大的兵力，并且有其他西方帝国主义国家特别是美帝国主义的支持，却无法取得胜利。
    本·优素福·本·赫达团长在综述了法国政府在军事、政治、经济等方面的失败以后，指出是这一切迫使戴高乐发表了9月16日的声明。他指出戴高乐这个声明仍然无视阿尔及利亚民族的存在和阿尔及利亚人民对于民族独立的渴望。“因此，迫切要求掌握自己的命运、掌握自己的政治、经济事务的阿尔及利亚人民根本不会考虑这样的声明。他们将继续为解放和民族独立而斗争下去，不管这个斗争将持续多久。”
    他强调说，阿尔及利亚人民是要求和平的，但他们所要求的不是在殖民地体系内的和平，不是法帝国主义强加于身的和平，而是自由、民主的和平，是尊重他们的独立和尊严的和平。
    他告诉记者们说，法帝国主义在不久前曾经在阿尔及利亚中部的一个特定区域内集中八至十万的兵力，企图消灭这个地区的只有四百多人的民族解放军部队，但这个阴谋却可耻的失败了。同时，法帝国主义在政治上企图把阿尔及利亚并入法兰西共同体中去，并且发表了所谓“君士坦丁”计划，企图转移阿尔及利亚人民对革命的注意力，这个诡计也都毫无例外地遭到了失败。
    在谈到法帝国主义的另一个阴谋——企图把撒哈拉自然资源转让给外国资本时，本·优素福·本·赫达团长说：阿尔及利亚人民不承认法国政府与西方资本关于撒哈拉的一切协议。
    本·优素福·本·赫达团长热情地谈到代表团在中国的东北和北京的访问。他说：“我们看到中国人民在工业、农业和文化教育事业上都取得了巨大的进展，这一切证明毛泽东主席所领导的大跃进已经取得了辉煌的成就。在工厂里，我们看到工人们热情地劳动，因为他们相信他们是在为人民劳动着。”
    他说，中国的人民公社本身是一个革命的行动，它关系到五亿多人民的生活。代表团在公社里看到，农业生产和农民的生活水平都已经提高。他说，在不到一年的时间内，就有两个阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团和一个军事代表团访问中国，这证明两国政府和人民间的友谊正在日益发展。
    本·优素福·本·赫达团长最后表示感谢中国人民对阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团的热情接待，他说，这种接待同时也是对正在为民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的支持和同情。
