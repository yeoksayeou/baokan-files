Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Ministry of Commerce called on workers on the national commercial front to seize the current favorable opportunity and further launch a Red Flag Movement centered on fulfilling and overfulfilling the procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products and actively supporting the people's communes in developing diversified operations, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's commercial work tasks ahead of schedule, and making preparations for the continued Great Leap Forward in the first quarter of next year. This battle call was made by the Ministry of Commerce at a telephone conference held on the 12th.

The meeting was chaired by Cheng Zihua, Minister of Commerce. Hebei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Henan and other provinces reported on the progress of the Red Flag Movement in the commercial system. Cheng Zihua analyzed the current situation of commercial work at the meeting. He said that since the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the broad masses of commercial workers have been in high spirits and high morale, and a new high tide of the Red Flag Movement has emerged on the commercial front, sweeping away right-leaning ideas, fiercely attacking conservatism, and focusing on completing the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products. The characteristics of this mass movement are: grand scale, rapid development, significant economic results, both vigorous and down-to-earth. Due to the development of the mass movement, the purchase volume of major agricultural products such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea has continued to rise, and more and more units have completed and overfulfilled their plans. As of October 5, compared with the same period last year, the national purchase volume of major agricultural products increased by 73% for cotton, 19% for jute, 78% for new flue-cured tobacco, and 11.21% for tea. Counties and cities such as Anren in Hunan, Wuwei in Gansu, Fanshi, Ningwu, Wutai, Yicheng, Datong in Shanxi, and Gaocheng and Huailai in Hebei have all completed the annual procurement plans for various agricultural products or individual agricultural products a quarter ahead of schedule.

Cheng Zihua said that the current situation on the commercial front is extremely favorable. The industrial front is vigorously carrying out the movement for high yield, high quality, and low cost, striving for a special Great Leap Forward in industrial production; the agricultural front's intensive "Three Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn sowing) activities and diversified operations have been fully launched, and the current market situation is also very good. The supply situation of some small products that were once lacking in the market has fundamentally improved. These are extremely favorable conditions for doing commercial work well, and commercial departments in various places must seize this favorable opportunity, grasp ideology, grasp tasks, grasp policies, and grasp measures, vigorously carry out the Red Flag Movement, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's commercial work tasks ahead of schedule.

In order to successfully complete this task, Cheng Zihua asked all localities to do the following tasks well:

In terms of procurement: (1) Seize the opportunity, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized, and strive to complete and overfulfill the procurement plan for cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea ahead of schedule. (2) Actively support and organize people's communes to vigorously develop diversified operations, especially to assist communes in doing a good job in the "small autumn harvest" of various wild raw materials, and do a good job in the procurement of wild raw materials. Some wild products should be planned for a longer term, and harvesting and production and reproduction should be arranged uniformly to protect production. (3) Actively and proactively cooperate with aquatic product departments to do a good job in the production, procurement, processing, and transportation of fisheries. (4) Further improve industrial and commercial cooperation, and actively assist light industry and handicrafts in solving the problems of raw materials, materials, and fuel. If industry completes its plan ahead of schedule, commerce will purchase ahead of schedule; if industry overproduces, commerce will over-purchase. In short, we must do everything possible to support production and meet the needs of all parties.

While vigorously grasping procurement, we must carry out processing and transportation as soon as possible, striving to achieve procurement and transportation simultaneously; we must also vigorously do a good job in storage to prevent goods from being damaged.

In terms of supply: (1) Do a good job in the supply of agricultural means of production, and do everything possible to support the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, and support the construction of farmland water conservancy this winter and next spring. (2) Strive to do a good job in the supply of living materials in industrial and mining areas and rural areas, go to the front line of production to supply, ensure that workers and the masses eat well and dress well, and can buy daily necessities in a timely manner. We must continue to implement the policy of "priority supply of industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas to the countryside" to meet the needs of farmers.

In order to transfer agricultural and sideline native products to the cities in a timely manner, and to transport industrial products to the countryside quickly, commercial departments must assist relevant departments in actively developing mass short-distance transportation, help people's communes to uniformly arrange labor, and establish and improve professional transportation teams. Continue to carry out return-trip transportation, and do everything possible to utilize all available transportation forces.

Cheng Zihua also asked commercial departments to comprehensively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, improve enterprise management, reduce commodity circulation costs, and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of saving 800 million yuan in the national commercial system.

　　商业战线红旗运动起高潮
    全力提前收足农副产品  支持公社发展多种经营
    商业部发出战斗号召  抓时机、抓思想、抓任务、抓政策
    据新华社13日讯　商业部号召全国商业战线职工，抓紧当前有利时机，进一步开展一个以完成和超额完成农副产品收购计划和积极支持人民公社发展多种经营为中心的红旗运动，力争提前和超额完成今年的商业工作任务，并且为明年第一季度的继续大跃进作好准备工作。这个战斗号召是商业部在12日召开的电话会议上提出的。
    会议由商业部部长程子华主持。河北、福建、江苏、河南等省汇报了目前商业系统红旗运动开展的情况。程子华在会上分析了当前商业工作的形势。他说，自从党的八届八中全会决议公布后，广大商业职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，商业战线上出现了一个横扫右倾、猛攻保守，以完成农副产品采购任务为重点的红旗运动新高潮。这个群众运动的特点是：规模壮阔，发展迅速，经济效果显著，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。由于群众运动的开展，棉、麻、烟、茶等主要农产品收购量不断上升，完成和超额完成计划的单位越来越多。到10月5日，全国主要农产品的收购量与去年同期比较，棉花增长73％，黄麻增长19％，新烤烟增长78％，茶叶增长11.21％。湖南安仁、甘肃武威、山西繁峙、宁武、五台、翼城、大同、河北藁城、怀来等县、市，都提前一个季度完成了全年的各项农产品或单项农产品的采购计划。
    程子华说，当前商业战线上的形势是极为有利的。工业战线上正在大力开展高产优质低成本运动，争取工业生产特大跃进；农业战线上紧张的“三秋”（秋收、秋耕、秋种）活动和多种经营已经全面展开，当前市场情况也很好，过去市场上一度缺少的一些小产品的供应情况已经根本好转。这些都是做好商业工作极为有利的条件，各地商业部门必须抓住这一有利时机，抓思想、抓任务、抓政策、抓措施，大搞红旗运动，力争提前和超额完成今年的商业工作任务。
    为了胜利完成这一任务，程子华要求各地做好以下几项工作：
    在收购工作方面：（一）要抓住时机，动员一切可以动员的力量，力争提前和超额完成棉、麻、烟、茶的收购计划。（二）积极支持和组织人民公社大搞多种经营，特别要协助公社搞好各种野生原料的“小秋收”，做好野生原料的收购工作。有些野生产品要作出较长远的规划，把采摘和生产繁殖统一安排，以保护生产。（三）积极主动地配合水产部门，做好渔业的生产、收购、加工、调运工作。（四）进一步搞好工商协作，积极协助轻工业和手工业解决原料、材料、燃料问题。工业提前完成计划，商业就提前收购；工业超产，商业就超收。总之，要尽一切力量支持生产，满足各方面的需要。
    在大抓收购的同时，要尽快地进行加工调运，争取做到随收随运；还要大力做好保管工作，不让商品受到损失。
    在供应工作方面：（一）作好农业生产资料的供应工作，千方百计地支持秋收、秋耕、秋种，支援今冬明春的农田水利建设。（二）努力做好工矿区和农村的生活资料供应工作，到生产前线去供应，保证职工群众吃好、穿好，并且能及时买到日用品。要继续贯彻“城乡都需要的工业品优先供应农村”的方针，以满足农民需要。
    为了把农副土特产品及时调进城市，把工业品迅速运送下乡，商业部门必须协助有关部门积极开展群众性的短途运输，帮助人民公社统一安排劳动力，建立和健全专业运输队。继续开展回空捎脚运输，千方百计地把可以利用的运输力量都利用起来。
    程子华还要求商业部门全面地开展增产节约运动，提高企业管理水平，降低商品流转费用，为完成和超额完成全国商业系统节约八亿元的任务而奋斗。
