    The reactionary forces at home and abroad have viciously slandered the people's communes. It is inevitable that a dog's mouth cannot produce ivory. It is also not surprising that right-leaning opportunists have shamelessly vilified the people's communes, because the rapid development of the revolution will always frighten some people. But they put on a look of being concerned about the world and its people, being righteous, and acting on behalf of Heaven, and this appearance is really disgusting.

    I once worked and trained in the countryside and established a good relationship with a "five-guarantee household." This old couple, both in their seventies, had lost their ability to work, and even their ability to move was almost gone. I went to see them during the Spring Festival this year, and they cooked dumplings for me. I was surprised why they could still cook dumplings at this time (the third day of the Lunar New Year). They said that the public canteen gave them each three jin of white flour, one jin of pork, one jin of fish, and five jin of cabbage for the Spring Festival. They also told me that the canteen always sends their meals to them first every day, so they eat their fill, stay warm, and eat well. In the advanced cooperative, they still worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt, but now this trouble is also saved, and they live a more peaceful and happy old age. During the National Day, I went to see them again. At this time, the old man had passed away. The old woman talked about his funeral and was very grateful to the commune. She said that the commune bought the coffin and took care of the burial with the help of cadres and commune members. She never thought that someone without children would have such a good ending. I saw her wearing a clean new outfit, and there was a new quilt on the kang. She smiled and said, "This is also new, and I'm still reluctant to use it!" She also told me that the commune would also give her twelve yuan for pocket money before the New Year. "I never thought that someone who is about to die would enter the commune, this lucky nest!" When I asked her, "Some people advocate disbanding the communes and canteens. What do you think?" She burst into tears, "How can this be done! What are these people up to? What do they want to do to us?"

    Listen to the voice of this ordinary old woman: the people's commune is the people's "lucky nest"!
    "The people's commune is good!" Hundreds of millions of our people say this in unison. Although right-leaning opportunists think they are shouting for the people, this shout is welcomed by imperialists but not by the people. Listen to the old woman's question: "What are you up to?!"

    人民的“福窝”
    千里人
    国内外反动派对人民公社进行了恶毒的谩骂，狗嘴里吐不出象牙，这是必然的。右倾机会主义分子也对人民公社进行了无耻的污蔑，这也不足为奇，因为革命的急速发展，总会使一些人吓昏头脑。但他们装出一副悲天悯人、理直气壮、替天行道的样子，这神气着实叫人恶心。
    我曾在农村劳动锻炼，跟一个五保户建立了很好的关系。这户老两口，都七十多岁，失去了劳动能力，甚至活动的能力也几近失去了。今年春节的时候我去看望他们，他们为我煮了饺子。我惊奇为什么这时（初三）还能煮饺子。他们说过春节时公共食堂给他们每人三斤白面，一斤猪肉，一斤鱼，五斤白菜。他们还告诉我，平时食堂每天做好饭总是先给他们送去，吃得又饱又暖又好。在高级社时还操心柴米油盐，现在这种麻烦也省了，过着更平静而又幸福的晚年生活。国庆节时，我又去看望他们，这时大爷已去世了，大娘谈起他的丧事，对公社感激不尽。她说公社给买了棺材，在干部和社员们的照料下安葬了，想不到没儿没女会有这样好的收场。我看她穿着一身干净的新衣服，炕上还有一床新被子。她笑着说：“这也是新的，还舍不得盖哪！”她还告诉我，社里年前还要给她十二块钱零花。“想不到快死的人又进了公社这个福窝！”当我问她：“有人主张解散公社、食堂，你看怎样？”她顿时老泪横流起来，“这怎么能行啊！这些人安的什么心，他们想把我们怎样办？”
    听听这位普通老人的声音吧：人民公社是人民的“福窝”！
    “人民公社好！”我们亿万人民齐声这样说。尽管右倾机会主义分子自以为在为人民叫喊，无奈这叫喊恰恰为帝国主义者所欢迎，而不受人民的欢迎。听听这位老大娘的质问吧：你们“安的什么心？！”
