    On "Striving"
    Chen Tao
    The word "striving" is very significant. The same word "striving" is treated with two different attitudes and two different positions.
    Some people love to strive, they strive for fame, status, and enjoyment, and this desire only increases, truly "a short man climbing stairs" - step by step, already very high, but still not satisfied, inevitably falling from a high place, even if not smashed to pieces, they will end up with a broken head and bleeding, fractured bones and injured tendons.
    Recently, I listened to a report from a responsible comrade, who called these people "reaching-out faction." This metaphor is truly vivid and lifelike. These people do not "bow their heads and willingly be oxen for the children," serving as docile tools of the people, but instead, they regard themselves as meritorious officials and masters of the people, reigning above the Party and the people, reaching out to the Party and the people for this and that, striving for this and that. Although they are in the revolutionary camp, their thinking has not been thoroughly transformed, and their buttocks are still sitting on the side of the bourgeoisie, so in this stormy socialist revolution, they inevitably reveal their true colors and have difficulty passing the test.
    "The reaching-out faction is unacceptable!" This is absolutely true. To be a true revolutionary fighter, one must serve the people wholeheartedly, and never reach out to the people to strive for this or that. If you have made contributions to the revolutionary cause, the people will naturally respect you and give you the honor and due status, and these cannot be obtained by reaching out. On the contrary, if you insist on reaching out to strive, it only proves that you are not worthy of the respect and love of the people, and people will not hesitate to cut off your outstretched hand!
    To not reach out, one must dispel the idea of reaching out, one must undergo a complete transformation and thoroughly reform one's thinking; otherwise, once encountering suitable soil and climate, that hand will be ready to move again, reaching out to want this and strive for that, which would be too dangerous.
    However, the reaching-out faction is, after all, a minority among us. The vast majority of people have a completely different style.
    Everyone also values the word "striving," and strives greatly and specially, but what everyone strives for is very different from the so-called striving of the reaching-out faction. Everyone strives for how to increase production, do a good job in construction, and rapidly change the poor and blank state of our country; strives for who has the highest communist style, who serves the people better, and who contributes the most to the work of increasing honor for the motherland. …Our general line is: go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. What everyone strives for is also this "aim high," and the purpose of striving is nothing more than to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to make our motherland more prosperous and strong, and the people's lives happier and better.
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the general line, hundreds of millions of our people went all out, aimed high, worked hard and skillfully, each showing their talents, and achieved great results on various fronts such as industry and agriculture. And this year, especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great fighting call, everyone's confidence is even stronger, their enthusiasm is even higher, each one is vigorous and determined to strive to complete this year's magnificent three major goals. Everyone has made a grand aspiration: to add glory to the motherland.
    Two kinds of striving, two positions, the boundaries are clear, and it is clear at a glance.
    However, what the "reaching-out faction" strives for is, after all, something that cannot be exposed to the sun, and can only do tricks in secret. When their desires are not satisfied, they tear off their disguise and reveal their true colors. Because they stand on the bourgeois position, they do not care about the masses, do not care about the interests of the revolution, and are utter backward elements. Therefore, they are extremely dissatisfied with the masses' soaring enthusiasm and the booming revolutionary activities, regard them as thorns in their eyes, and slander that this is wrong and that is terrible, constantly making sarcastic remarks, as if they have always been correct. As the saying goes, "A bad person has difficulty traveling everywhere, and a night bat is afraid of seeing the sun." Who is right and who is wrong, isn't it all clear now? We resolutely oppose the "striving" of the "reaching-out faction"; and the spirit of "going all out and aiming high" of the revolutionary promoters should be greatly promoted. We must continue to strive, striving for one victory after another, so that the infinitely beautiful communist society will arrive sooner!

### 谈“争”

    谈“争”
    陈涛
    一个“争”字，大有讲究。同一个“争”，人们对待它却有两种不同的态度，两种不同的立场。
    有一种人很爱争，他们争的是名誉，地位，享受，而且这种欲望有增无已，真是“矮子爬楼梯”——步步登高，已经很高了，却还不满足，终于不免从高处摔将下来，即使不粉身碎骨，也会弄得头破血流，骨折筋伤。
    最近听了一个负责同志的报告，他把这种人叫做“伸手派”。这个比喻真是形象、生动极了。这种人不“俯首甘为孺子牛”，作人民驯服的工具，而是以人民的功臣和老爷自居，驾临党和人民之上，向党和人民伸手要这，要那，争这，争那。他们虽身在革命阵营，思想却未得到彻底改造，屁股还坐在资产阶级那边，于是在这暴风骤雨的社会主义革命关头，就不免现出原形，难过关隘。
    “伸手派做不得”！这是千真万确的。要想做一个真正的革命战士，就得全心全意为人民服务，千万莫向人民伸手争这要那。你对革命事业立了功，人民自会尊敬你，给你荣誉和应有的地位，而这些靠伸手是争不来的。相反，你硬要伸手来争，那只证明你是一个不配受人民尊敬和爱戴的人，人们将毫不客气地把你伸出来的手斩断！
    要不伸手，就得打消伸手的念头，就得脱胎换骨，彻底改造思想，不然的话，一遇到适当的土壤和气候，那双手又会蠢蠢欲动，伸出来要这争那，那可就太危险了。
    然而，伸手派在我们这里毕竟是少数。绝大多数人却具有完全不同的另外一种风格。
    大家也看重这个争字，而且是大争特争，但所争者和伸手派的所谓争大不相同。大家争的是如何增加生产，搞好建设，迅速改变我们国家一穷二白的面貌；争的是谁的共产主义风格最高，谁为人民服务得更好，谁在为祖国增加荣誉的工作中贡献最大。……我们的总路线是：鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。大家所力争的也就是这个“上游”，争的目的无非是要多快好省地建设社会主义，使我们祖国更加富强，人民的生活更加幸福美好。
    在去年的大跃进中，我们亿万群众在总路线的光辉照耀之下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，一个个苦干巧干，各显才能，在工业、农业等各条战线上争得了巨大的成绩。而今年，尤其是在党的八届八中全会发出伟大的战斗号召以后，大家的信心更足，干劲更高，一个个生龙活虎，决心为争取完成今年宏伟的三大目标而奋斗，大家都立下了一个宏愿：要为祖国增光，
    两种争，两个立场，界限鲜明，一目了然。
    然而，“伸手派”所争的毕竟是见不得阳光的东西，只能暗地弄鬼，当欲望没有得到满足的时候，他们撕下伪装原形毕露了。因为他们站在资产阶级立场，不关心群众，不关心革命利益，是十足的促退派，因而他们对群众的冲天干劲和轰轰烈烈的革命活动极为不满，视为眼中之钉，污蔑说这也错了，那也糟了，风凉话说个不完，似乎他们倒是一贯正确的了。俗话说得好：“坏心人难走四方，夜蝙蝠怕见太阳”，谁是谁非，现在不都一清二楚了么？“伸手派”的那种“争”，我们坚决反对；而革命的促进派那种“鼓足干劲，力争上游”的“争”的精神，还要大大发扬，我们要一直争下去，争到一个又一个的胜利，使无限美好的共产主义社会早日到来！
