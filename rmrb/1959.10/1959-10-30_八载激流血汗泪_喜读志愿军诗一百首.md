Eight Years of Torrential Blood, Sweat, and Tears
——Delighted to Read "One Hundred Poems of the Chinese People's Volunteers"
Wei Chuantong

In mid-September of 1958, I heard the talks of the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) delegation who were bidding farewell in various counties and cities. Many of them used poetic language to describe the deep friendship between the heroic Korean people and their army and the CPV over the past eight years. Truly: Though people bid farewell to the land of heroes, their hearts are connected forever.

During the severe war, they shared life and death together, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and defeated the invading army headed by U.S. imperialism, proving to the world that U.S. imperialism is not terrifying and can be defeated. This paper tiger has been punctured!

After the armistice, they rebuilt their homeland together, carrying out enormous reconstruction work. The soldiers said: "Use our sweat to irrigate the flowers of combat friendship."

After the news of the CPV's withdrawal and return home spread, a labor upsurge for the construction of North Korea was set off in the troops, engaging in production and preparing farewell gifts. Most were a gift accompanied by a poem, such as: "Mother and son of one mind, tied a pumpkin to send to friends," "Small stool, the gift is small, my heart you represent," and so on. The gifts made by the soldiers with their labor and wisdom were truly touching. The closer the time of their farewell, the more tears of enthusiasm burst forth.

From the above, I cannot help but think:

	"Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland,
	Share life and death to eliminate the root of disaster;
	Eight years of torrential blood, sweat, and tears,
	China and North Korea, people forever close!"

At the same time, I also suggest:

	To think after departure, to leave for eternity,
	Glorious CPV, finely select three hundred poems.

Now "One Hundred Poems of the Chinese People's Volunteers" has met with the vast readership. Although this collection of poems does not have three hundred poems, it is indeed a selection of the best from the vast poems. I very much agree with Comrade Guo Moruo's preface, which praises "the most beloved people and the most beloved poems," and it is also an "epic of heroes." I am convinced that it will be passed down forever. Just as the great righteous struggle to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland will be recorded in history and forever shine brightly.

This collection of poems is solid proof. It proves that the aggressive wars waged by the imperialist aggressive blocs are unjust and have no future. U.S. imperialism is the culprit of the aggression against North Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to strive for peace in the Far East and the world, took the initiative to completely withdraw from North Korea, which will be a full year, while the U.S. aggressors are still clinging on and refusing to leave, which will inevitably end up lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet.

In concluding this short article, I recall the scene when the CPV headquarters left North Korea:

	Finally, bidding farewell to the CPV,
	Heroic Pyongyang is all new;
	People like rivers, flowers like the sea,
	Friendship deeper than flesh and blood, intentions even deeper.

This collection of poems—"One Hundred Poems of the Chinese People's Volunteers"—is the crystallization of the blood, sweat, and tears of the people of China and North Korea. Reading it, we can gain new insights into enhancing patriotism and internationalism.

    八载激流血汗泪
    ——喜读志愿军诗一百首
    魏传统
    1958年的9月中旬，我听到赴各道郡市告别的志愿军代表团的同志们的谈话。他们很多人都用诗一般的语言，来描述英雄的朝鲜人民及其军队：八年来与志愿军亲密相处的深情厚谊。真是：人虽告别英雄地，两心相伴永相连。
    在严酷的战争时候，他们一同出生入死，并肩作战，打败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军，向全世界证明了美帝国主义并不可怕，是可以打败的。这只纸老虎已被戳穿了！
    停战以后，他们一同重建家园，进行巨大的恢复建设工作。战士们说：“用自己的汗水来灌溉战斗友谊之花。”
    志愿军撤军归国的消息传出以后，在部队里掀起了为朝鲜人民进行建设的劳动热潮，一面从事生产，一面准备告别的礼品，并作到大多数是一件礼品，一首诗，如说：“母亲儿子一条心，结成南瓜送友人”，“小板凳，礼物小，我的心意你代表”等等，战士们用自己的劳动和智慧所制作出来的礼物实在令人感动。他们离告别的时间越近，迸发出来热情的泪珠就越多。
    由上所述，不禁使我想到：
    “抗美援朝保家园，
    同生共死除祸根；
    八载激流血汗泪，
    中朝人民永相亲！”
    同时，我也建议：
    作到去后思，留得万世知，
    光荣志愿军，精选三百诗。
    现在“志愿军诗一百首”已经与广大读者见面了。这本诗集虽然没有三百篇，但它确是广大的诗篇中精选出来的。我很赞成郭沫若同志的代序所歌颂的，是“最可爱的人呵最可爱的诗”，而且它又是“英雄诗史”。我确信，它会永远流传下去的。正如伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的正义斗争，载诸史册而永远焕发光辉一样。
    本诗集是一个铁证。它证明帝国主义侵略集团所进行的侵略战争是非正义的，没有前途的。美帝国主义是侵略朝鲜的祸首，中国人民志愿军为了争取远东和世界和平，主动全部撤出朝鲜，将满周年，而美国侵略者至今仍赖住不走，这终必是搬起石头打自己的脚的。
    在结束这篇短文时，我又忆起志愿军总部离开朝鲜时的情景，正是：
    最后送别志愿军，
    英雄平壤色色新；
    人如江河花如海，
    情逾骨肉意更深。
    这本诗集——志愿军诗一百首，是中朝两国人民的血汗和热泪的结晶。我们阅读它，对于增强爱国主义与国际主义即可获得新的启示。
