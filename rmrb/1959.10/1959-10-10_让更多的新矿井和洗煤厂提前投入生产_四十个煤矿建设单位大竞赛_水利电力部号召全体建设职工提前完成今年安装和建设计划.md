Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th: The Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union recently held a national conference of coal mine capital construction cadres in Pingdingshan, Henan Province, calling on coal mine construction workers across the country to further accelerate the pace of capital construction so that more new mines and coal washeries can be put into production as early as possible and overfulfill this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule.
    The conference summarized the significant achievements and experiences in coal mine capital construction in the first eight months of this year. The conference pointed out that this year, coal mine capital construction has continued to move forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, and the amount of work completed and the production capacity of mines transferred to production have greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year. The construction period of various projects has been generally shortened. The construction period of the Haotang Mine in Pingdingshan, with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal, took only twenty months; the Matou Coal Washery, currently the largest in the country with an annual washing capacity of 2 million tons, took only twenty-four months. These projects were completed and put into production several months and more than a year ahead of the design requirements. The three simple coal washeries in Fengfeng Mine took only four months from the start of construction to the transfer to production, shortening the construction period of similar-scale coal washeries by about one year compared to the past.
    The conference pointed out that this year's coal mine capital construction plan stipulates that the production capacity of mines transferred to production will increase by 35% compared to last year, and the production capacity of coal washeries transferred to production will increase by eleven times compared to last year. Completing this year's capital construction tasks is of great significance for ensuring the realization of this year's production plan of 335 million tons of coal, promoting the development of the steel industry, and for the continued Great Leap Forward of the coal industry next year. The conference proposed that the coal industry front must achieve a double leap forward in production and construction, continue to deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy and the socialist labor competition, and vigorously promote mass movements. Coal mine construction should continue to promote various advanced experiences, strengthen planning management, implement investment contracting, team economic accounting, and quality acceptance systems, and comprehensively achieve leap forward targets and large-scale bumper harvests.
    During the conference, representatives from various regions enthusiastically launched head-to-head competitions and linked competitions between provinces, bureaus, and districts. Heilongjiang Province proposed to compete with Henan Province under the condition of completing the annual plan one month ahead of schedule; Fengfeng Capital Construction Bureau of Hebei Province proposed to compete with the No. 1 well in Pingdingshan (designed annual output of 1.5 million tons), which is under construction, at the speed of building the Xiecun large-scale mine (designed annual output of 900,000 tons) in sixteen months. More than forty units proposed to compete with each other at the meeting.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently issued instructions, requiring all capital construction sites to advance victoriously in the fourth quarter, complete the original annual plan of installing 2.3 million kilowatts of power generating equipment one month ahead of schedule, and strive to overfulfill this year's capital construction tasks by 20% by the end of the year.
    The instruction pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the capital construction of China's power industry has maintained a high rate of development. From January to August, the installed capacity of power generating equipment put into production nationwide reached 710,000 kilowatts, 18% more than the capacity of power generating equipment built during the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. After September, encouraged by the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, an even greater leap forward situation has emerged in the capital construction of the national power industry. Many power station construction sites have launched vigorous mass movements to increase production and practice economy, the cooperation between various departments has been unprecedentedly strengthened, new production records have emerged one after another, and the construction progress has been greatly accelerated. In September alone, the newly installed capacity of power generating equipment nationwide reached 570,000 kilowatts, equivalent to 80% of the capacity of power generating equipment put into production in the previous eight months. Now, this movement to increase production and practice economy is continuing to move forward with the force of ten thousand horses galloping. Based on this situation, coupled with the favorable conditions that the plant buildings of most power generation projects have been built and the main equipment has arrived, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power believes that it is entirely possible to continue the Great Leap Forward in the fourth quarter and strive to complete the annual installed capacity plan ahead of schedule and greatly exceed it. The key lies in thoroughly overcoming the right-leaning and slackening sentiments among a few cadres, continuing to vigorously promote mass movements, vigorously carry out technical revolutions, and continue to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power requires all capital construction units to focus on the following links in the fourth quarter: strengthen equipment matching and unified allocation of important materials. Leading cadres must continue to strengthen leadership on the front line of production, discover problems, and solve them immediately. While focusing on the construction of power stations, it is necessary to seize the construction of corresponding power transmission and transformation projects, and strengthen the training of new machine operators so that the new power generation projects can be put into production and the power can be safely transmitted in a timely manner.

### 让更多的新矿井和洗煤厂提前投入生产  四十个煤矿建设单位大竞赛  水利电力部号召全体建设职工提前完成今年安装和建设计划

    让更多的新矿井和洗煤厂提前投入生产
    四十个煤矿建设单位大竞赛
    水利电力部号召全体建设职工提前完成今年安装和建设计划
    新华社郑州9日电　煤炭工业部、煤矿工会全国委员会最近在河南省平顶山召开全国煤矿基本建设干部会议，号召全国煤矿建设职工进一步加快基本建设速度，使更多的新矿井、洗煤厂及早投入生产，提前超额完成今年基本建设计划。
    这次会议总结了今年头八个月煤矿基本建设取得的重大成就和经验。会议指出，今年煤矿基本建设在去年大跃进的基础上继续向前迈进，完成的工作量和移交生产的矿井生产能力，都大大超过了去年同期的水平。各种工程的建设工期普遍缩短。年产煤九十万吨的平顶山郝堂矿矿井，建设工期只用了二十个月；目前国内最大的年洗煤二百万吨的马头洗煤厂，建设工期只用了二十四个月。这些工程都比设计要求提前几个月和一年多建成投入生产。峰峰矿的三座简易洗煤厂，从开工到移交生产，只用了四个月，比过去同样规模洗煤厂的建设工期缩短一年左右。
    会议指出，今年煤矿基本建设计划规定，移交生产的矿井生产能力将比去年增长35％，移交生产的洗煤厂生产能力将比去年增长十一倍。完成今年的基本建设任务，对于保证实现今年三亿三千五百万吨煤的生产计划，促进钢铁工业的发展，为明年煤炭工业的继续大跃进，都有重大意义。会议提出当前煤炭工业战线必须生产建设双跃进，要继续深入地开展增产节约运动和社会主义劳动竞赛，大搞群众运动。煤矿建设要继续推广各种先进经验，加强计划管理，实行投资包干，班组经济核算和质量验收等制度，全面实现跃进指标和大面积的丰产。
    会议期间，各地代表热烈地开展了省与省、局与局、区与区的对手赛，挂钩赛。黑龙江省提出了提前一个月完成全年计划的条件同河南省竞赛；河北省峰峰基本建设局提出，要以十六个月建成薛村大型矿井（设计年产量九十万吨）的速度，同正在建设的平顶山一号井（设计年产一百五十万吨）竞赛。会上提出相互竞赛的有四十多个单位。
    据新华社9日讯　水利电力部最近发出指示，要求各基本建设工地在第四季度中乘胜前进，提前一个月完成原定全年安装二百三十万瓩发电设备的计划，并且争取到今年年底，超额20％完成今年的基本建设任务。
    这个指示指出，今年以来，我国电力工业基本建设一直保持着高速度的发展。1月至8月，全国投入生产的发电设备容量达七十一万瓩，比大跃进的1958年同期建成的发电设备容量还多18％。9月以后，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，全国电力工业基本建设出现了更大的跃进局面。许多电站建设工地掀起了声势浩大的增产节约群众运动，各部门之间的协作空前加强，新的生产纪录一个接着一个出现，施工进度大大加快。9月份一个月内，全国新安装的发电设备容量就达五十七万瓩，相当于前八个月投入生产的发电设备容量80％。现在，这个增产节约运动还在以万马奔腾之势继续向前发展。根据这一形势，加上目前大部分发电工程的厂房已经盖起，主要设备已经到齐等有利条件，水利电力部认为在第四季度内继续大跃进，争取提前和大大超额完成今年的装机容量计划是完全可能的。关键在于必须彻底克服少数干部中的右倾松劲情绪，继续大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，把增产节约运动继续深入地开展下去。
    水利电力部要求各基本建设单位在第四季度中必须抓好以下几个环节：加强设备配套和重要器材的统一调配工作。领导干部要继续加强生产第一线的领导，发现问题，立刻解决。在大抓电站建设工程的同时，必须抓紧与之相适应的送变电工程的建设，加强新机运行人员的培养训练工作，使新发电工程投入生产以后，能够及时安全地把电力输送出去。
