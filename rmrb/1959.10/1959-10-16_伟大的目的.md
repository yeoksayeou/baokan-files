Great Goal
　　Yang Qi

    Based on the discussions of cadres and masses in various localities, the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has set such a plan: next year's total grain output will increase by 30% compared to this year; among them, the total summer grain output will increase by 65.8% compared to this year. Nantong area is an economic crop area, why should it greatly increase grain production? In order to support the country's socialist construction with greater strength. In the past, this area relied on the state for grain supply; they made a great ambition to change this situation. This year, due to the great leap forward in grain production, the grain transferred from other places has been reduced by half compared to the past. Next year, it will achieve grain self-sufficiency with surplus. Of course, doing so does not mean abandoning economic crops, but to make cotton and other economic crops also achieve comprehensive high yields. - In any case, the Nantong area's Party committee and the masses have set a great goal. From their plan, we can see a soaring socialist spirit. From such a great goal, great strength will inevitably be generated.
    Can such a plan be realized? Let's see how their plan was made! Let's see what their drive and measures are! Their plan was not fantasized in the room, but the result of mass discussion, the result of examining the conditions of soil, water conservancy, stubble, and so on. After the plan was announced, a large-scale mass movement to ensure comprehensive high yields of summer crops immediately emerged. The mass movement is so vigorous, so down-to-earth, so high, and so meticulous. There are comprehensive high-yield competitions, and there are also single high-yield competitions for various crops; compete to improve production, and also compete to care for the lives of the masses; compete for hard work, and also compete for clever work; compare agriculture, and also compare community-run industry and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery; the competitors are also the collaborators. It is particularly meaningful that they have launched the "poor team to turn over" competition, the marginal area competition, and the elimination of "three types of seedlings" competition, which can make the mass movement form a climax in the weakest places, and it is these places that have particularly great potential. In order to ensure the elimination of "three types of seedlings" and ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest, they have tightly grasped from the sowing stage, established a "one-line" organization, implemented "three guarantees", formed professional teams for various crops, and did not relax every link, from planting to harvesting, grasping to the end, and set clear and specific evaluation items for each stage. - From these situations, there is sufficient reason to say that their plan is a truly implemented plan.
    Some people think that "the lower the target, the better, is the implementation". They have not even started to walk and have already lost their spirit, and they can't say anything else; as a result, they can only go to the opposite of implementation - failure. Why do they think that "the lower the target, the better"? Some are afraid of being "too nervous"; some are afraid of "more production and more purchase"; some are afraid of "losing face if the plan is not completed" ... In short, what dominates the mind is the small personal interest. Once separated from the collective interest, the ultimate result is that personal interests will inevitably fail. In our era, in our society, any behavior that deviates from the collective interest will not have good results. Setting the target to a level that can be achieved without much effort is a practice that violates the fundamental interests of the masses, is a practice that destroys one's own ambition, and is a practice that directly violates the general line of socialist construction, and will inevitably be opposed by the masses.
    Great achievements arise from great perseverance; great perseverance arises from great goals; great goals arise from great reality. The drive to go all out is an objective existence, and striving for the upstream is also an objective existence. Right-leaning thought obscures one's vision, and one cannot see the great reality that exists objectively, and naturally there will be no great goal. Therefore, all right-leaning thoughts must be "swept away" with the momentum of autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. To formulate plans, we must "sweep away right-leaning", and to implement plans, we must continue to "sweep away right-leaning"; sweep away until it is clean, and never leave a little bit. The Nantong area's big broom of "sweeping away right-leaning" can be borrowed by all localities.

　　伟大的目的
　　杨弃
    中共南通地委根据各地干部和群众讨论的结果，定出了这样的规划：明年粮食总产量要比今年增加30％；其中夏收粮食总产量要比今年增加65.8％。南通地区是经济作物区，为什么要大量增产粮食？为了用更大的力量支援国家的社会主义建设。这地方过去历年依靠国家供应粮食；他们立下大志要改变这个局面。今年，由于粮食产量大跃进，从外地调进的粮食已经比过去减少了一半。明年，就要做到粮食自给有余。当然，这样做并不是要放弃经济作物，而是要使棉花和别的经济作物也都全面高产。——无论从哪方面来说，南通地区的党委和群众定下的都是一个伟大的目的。从他们的规划中，可以看到一股冲天的社会主义正气。从这样的伟大的目的中，必然会产生伟大的力量。
    这样的规划能实现吗？且看他们的规划是怎样做出来的吧！且看他们的干劲和措施是怎样的吧！他们的规划并不是坐在屋子里空想出来的，而是群众讨论的结果，是考察了土壤、水利、茬口等等条件的结果。规划宣布以后，就立即出现了确保夏熟作物全面高产的声势浩大的群众运动。群众运动是那么轰轰烈烈，又那么踏踏实实，那么高涨，又那么细致。有全面高产竞赛，又有各种作物的单项高产竞赛；赛改进生产，也赛关心群众生活；比苦干，也比巧干；比农业，还比社办工业和林、牧、副、渔；竞赛的对手，也就是协作的对手。特别有意义的是他们开展了“穷队翻身”竞赛，边缘地区竞赛，消灭“三类苗”竞赛，这就能使群众运动在最薄弱的地方也形成高潮，而又正是这些地方有特别巨大的潜力。他们为了确保消灭“三类苗”，确保全面大丰收，从播种阶段开始就紧紧抓住，建立“一条线”组织，实行了“三包”，组成了各项作物的专业队伍，每个环节都不放松，从种到收，一抓到底，每个阶段都订出了鲜明的具体的评比项目。——从这些情况来看，有充分的理由说，他们的规划是真正落实的规划。
    有些人认为“指标越低越好，才是落实”。他们还没有开步走就先泄了气，别的就什么也说不上了；其结果，只能走向落实的反面——落空。为什么会认为“指标越低越好”？有的是怕“太紧张”；有的是怕“多产多购”；有的是怕“完不成计划丢人”……总之，支配着思想的是渺小的个人利益。既离开了集体利益，其最终的结果，个人利益也必然落空。在我们的时代里，在我们的社会里，任何脱离集体利益的行为都是不会有好结果的。把指标定到不费多大力气也能达到的程度，是违反群众的根本利益的做法，是灭自己志气的做法，是直接违背社会主义建设总路线的做法，终必遭到群众的反对。
    伟大的成果产生于伟大的毅力；伟大的毅力产生于伟大的目的；伟大的目的产生于伟大的现实。鼓足干劲的干劲是客观的存在，力争上游的上游也是客观的存在。右倾思想一叶障目，就看不见客观存在的伟大的现实，自然就不会有伟大的目的。因此，对于一切右倾思想，必须以秋风扫落叶之势“横扫”之。制订规划要“横扫右倾”，实现规划还要继续“横扫右倾”；扫清为止，决不稍留。南通地区“横扫右倾”的大笤帚，各地都不妨借来一用。
