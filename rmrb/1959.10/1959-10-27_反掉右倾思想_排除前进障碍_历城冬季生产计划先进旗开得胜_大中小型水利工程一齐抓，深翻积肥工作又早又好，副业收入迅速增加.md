(Our Dispatch from Jinan, October 26th) The winter situation in Licheng County, Shandong is excellent, the masses are highly enthusiastic, and production is advancing rapidly. On the agricultural front, the county's grain crops are expected to increase by 33% compared to last year's 450 jin per mu; from January to September, diversified economic income reached 13 million yuan, an increase of 46% over the same period last year. Particularly encouraging is the significant achievement in autumn plowing and sowing. The wheat planting area has expanded from 350,000 mu last year to 540,000 mu, and sowing was completed ten days earlier than last year. Early sown wheat is already green. More than 70,000 mu of wheat has been watered and more than 80,000 mu has been fertilized. This has laid a good foundation for achieving a per-mu yield of 400 jin of wheat next year (this year's per-mu yield is 208 jin).

The 300,000 working farmers of Licheng County, with their spirit of continuous revolution and grand aspirations, after basically completing wheat planting, have expressed their determination to "work hard this winter, not do a little; to work continuously, not take a break; and to finish this winter what can be done, not postpone it to next spring." They did not remove their armor and did not halt their horses as they threw themselves into the winter production battle.

However, at this time, a small number of people with serious right-leaning thoughts emerged. They advocated that this winter should be carried out on a small scale, with production brigades or teams as units, and were unwilling to have the county or commune make unified plans for comprehensive and large-scale work. They emphasized that each team should take care of its own affairs and disagreed with large-scale collaboration. They emphasized only carrying out small projects that would benefit that year and were unwilling to engage in large and medium-sized capital construction projects. In distribution, they only cared about the current interests of small collectives and opposed increasing public accumulation. Some even said that after the three autumn tasks were completed, there was still a long time until next year, and we could take a break before continuing.

The Licheng County Party Committee believed that this was a manifestation of new right-leaning thought in the current movement and was the main ideological obstacle to striving for a great leap forward in agriculture next year. Therefore, before the three autumn tasks were completed, the county committee seized on three issues, organized commune members to discuss them, and effectively shattered right-leaning thought, promoting the continuous advancement of the production upsurge.

First, during the major production inspection and comparison, linking it to the work of the past year and the winter production plan, they raised questions such as "Is it better to work hard this winter or to do a little? Is it better to start early or to take a break before continuing?" and organized commune members to discuss them. The broad masses used irrefutable facts to criticize various erroneous opinions, further deepening the socialist ideology and the spirit of the General Line in people's hearts. For example, last winter, the entire Liubu Commune engaged in large-scale collaboration, working hard and diligently, and built four reservoirs, including the Badaling and Sanlongtan reservoirs, with a capacity of one million cubic meters each. The area of paddy fields expanded from 3,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu. This year, they resisted a rare drought in history and achieved a remarkable per-mu grain yield of more than 700 jin. In contrast, the Nanjiao Commune basically had each team working on its own last winter, and no large-scale water conservancy projects were built. This year, due to the drought, production was greatly reduced. In the discussion in the Beiyuan Commune, everyone also compared the experience and lessons learned from the Dayangzhuang Production Team, which engaged in deep plowing and close planting last winter, increasing production by 30%, and the Biaoshan Production Team, which did not work hard enough and only plowed the land in the spring and planted sparsely, resulting in a 10% reduction in production. From a large number of factual comparisons, people deeply realized that the hard work of Liubu and Dayangzhuang was beneficial to both the commune and the teams, and beneficial to both the present and laying the foundation for next year's production.

Second, they organized the masses to discuss and analyze the relationship between the good or bad production of the production team and the commune, further establishing the concept of the whole and the idea of loving the commune as a home. The Dahui Production Brigade of Liubu Commune, always putting the commune first, obeying the commune's leadership and plans, and conscientiously implementing advanced yield-increasing measures, increased grain production this year from 600 jin per mu to 800 jin, the grain purchase from 160,000 jin to 200,000 jin, and handed over 100,000 jin of reserve grain to the commune. In addition to retaining enough seeds and rations, the team also reserved 400,000 jin of grain. The Tangjia Production Brigade did not respect the commune's leadership, did not conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and some cadres were not active in their work, with the result that grain production still remained at the level of 240 jin per mu, and the purchase task was not completed. People put the situation of these two production teams together for comparative analysis and further realized the relationship between small collectives and large collectives.

Third, through distribution work, the masses deeply discussed: "Is it better to divide and spend all the harvest this year, or is it better to appropriately increase accumulation?" The Zhudian Brigade of the Dongjiao Commune had very good production this year, with the total agricultural output value increasing from 300,000 yuan last year to 600,000 yuan, an average of 233 yuan per person. When formulating the distribution plan, the production team leader actively advocated distributing more and deducting less. The commune members launched a debate on this idea and carefully calculated two accounts: one was that 100 yuan per person exceeded the life of a prosperous middle peasant, and they already had enough to eat and more than enough, and public accumulation should be increased; the other was that the existing funds (only 140,000 yuan) were far from meeting the needs of initially realizing agricultural electrification and mechanization in early next year. This calculation made the team leader suddenly realize that he had forgotten the more distant goal of realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. Everyone deeply realized that only caring about life and not caring about production, only caring about the present and not looking to the future, was in essence a dangerous right-leaning thought that did not want to continue the Great Leap Forward. When this truth was grasped by the broad masses, the winter production upsurge surged higher and higher.

The characteristics of Licheng's winter production this year are: advanced plans, large scale, strong momentum, and all armies winning victories. The Licheng County Party Committee plans to mobilize 150,000 people this winter to engage in large-scale water conservancy projects, grasping large, medium, and small projects simultaneously, working hard throughout the winter and spring, basically realizing water conservancy, and ensuring that 450,000 mu of the 540,000 mu of wheat will have a guaranteed harvest even without rain. Now 60,000 people have gone into battle, and seven larger projects with a capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters each, and more than 20 small water conservancy projects and more than 70 motorized wells have all started. Fifty thousand mu of ridge fields have been built in the 540,000 mu of wheat fields, of which more than 200,000 mu have reached the standards of garden fields. The wheat field management armies of the people's communes are formulating wheat management plans, implementing management plans to the fields, universally irrigating twice in winter (around the roots and before freezing), and universally applying fertilizer once. Plowing and manure accumulation are all more and better than in the same period last year. On this day last year, they were still planting wheat, and now they have winter plowed more than 20,000 mu, accumulating more than 500 million jin of fertilizer for winter topdressing of wheat.

Diversified management is also very active on the front. The County Party Committee plans to engage in large-scale sideline production in the fourth quarter, so that the total output value of sideline production will reach more than 14 million yuan, and the average income of the county's 600,000 people will increase by nearly 24 yuan per person. In the first half of October alone, the income was 1.6 million yuan, double the income in the first half of September. The county currently has 110,000 pigs and plans to increase it to 140,000 by the end of the year, and more than 4,200 pigs were added in the first half of October alone.

This continuous leap-forward situation has solved some difficulties that seemed insurmountable. According to the county's production plan for this winter, there is still a shortage of more than 8 million workdays. However, the people of Licheng County have not reduced the plan because of this, but have instead used it as a driving force to promote tool reform, launching a new upsurge of tool semi-mechanization and improvement.

    反掉右倾思想　排除前进障碍
    历城冬季生产计划先进旗开得胜
    大中小型水利工程一齐抓，深翻积肥工作又早又好，副业收入迅速增加
    本报济南26日电　山东历城县冬季形势很好，群众情绪高涨，生产一日千里。在农业战线上，全县粮食作物预计可比去年亩产四百五十斤增产33％；1至9月份多种经济收入达一千三百万元，比去年同期增加46％。特别鼓舞人心的是秋耕秋种工作获得很大成绩。种麦面积由去年的三十五万亩扩大到五十四万亩，并比去年提前十天种完，现在早播麦已经青青一片。有七万多亩小麦已浇过盘墩水，八万多亩追了肥。这就为实现明年小麦亩产四百斤打好了根基（今年亩产二百零八斤）。
    历城县具有不断革命精神和宏伟志愿的三十万劳动农民，在种麦基本结束以后，纷纷表示“今冬要大干不要小干，要紧接着干不要歇歇再干，能在今冬干完的事不推到明春去干”的战斗决心，人不解甲，马不停蹄地投入了冬季生产战斗。
    但是在这时候，也出现了一小部分右倾思想严重的人，他们主张今冬以生产大队或小队为单位小干，不愿意由县或公社统一规划全面大干；他们强调各队顾各队，不同意大协作；强调只搞当年受益的小工程，不愿意搞大、中型基本建设。在分配上，他们只顾小集体的当前利益，反对增加公共积累。还有人说：三秋工作结束后，离明年还远，可以歇歇再干。
    中共历城县委认为这是新的右倾思想在当前运动中的表现，是争取明年农业大跃进的主要思想阻力。因此，在三秋工作尚未结束时，县委就抓住三个问题，组织社员讨论，有效地粉碎了右倾思想，推动了生产高潮不断前进。
    第一，在生产大检查大评比当中，联系一年来的工作和冬季生产规划，提出“今冬大干好，还是小干好？早动手好，还是歇歇再干好？”等问题，组织社员讨论。广大群众以千真万确的事实，批判了各种错误意见，使社会主义思想和总路线精神更加深入人心。例如去冬柳埠公社全社大协作，大干苦干，修起八大岭、三龙坛等容水百万方的水库四个，水田面积由三千亩扩大到二万多亩，今年抗御了历史上罕见的旱灾，获得亩产粮食七百多斤的显著成绩。而南郊公社去冬基本上是各队干各队的，大型水利工程一个也没建成，今年因为受旱大大减产。北园公社在讨论中，大家还对比了去冬大杨庄生产队大搞深翻、密植，增产30％，而标山生产队干劲不足，春天才翻地、又是稀植，结果减产10％的经验教训。人们从大量事实对比中，十分深刻地认识到，像柳埠、大杨庄大干苦干的作法，既有利公社，也有利各队；既有利眼前，也为明年生产打下基础。
    第二，组织群众讨论和分析生产队的生产好坏与公社的关系，进一步树立了整体观念和爱社如家的思想。柳埠公社大会生产大队，处处以社为家，服从社的领导和计划，认真贯彻先进增产措施，今年粮食生产由亩产六百斤增长到八百斤，征购粮由十六万斤增至二十万斤，交给公社十万斤储备粮，本队除留足种子口粮外，还储备了四十万斤粮食。而汤家生产大队不尊重公社领导，不认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，有些干部工作不积极，结果粮食生产仍然停留在亩产二百四十斤的水平上，征购任务也没有完成。人们把这两个生产队的情况摆在一块对比分析，进一步认识到小集体和大集体的关系。
    第三，通过分配工作，让群众深刻地讨论了：“今年丰收了是分光花净好，还是适当增加积累好？”东郊公社祝甸大队今年生产很好，农业总产值由去年三十万元增长到六十万元，平均每人二百三十三元。在制定分配方案时，生产队长积极主张多分少扣。社员们就这个思想展开一场辩论，细算了两笔账：一算每人一百元就超过了富裕中农生活，已经有吃又有余，应当增加公共积累；二算现有资金（仅十四万元）和明年初步实现农业电气化、机械化的需要还相差很远。这一算，使这个队长恍然大悟，原来是自己忘记了更远大的目标——实现农业机械化、电气化。大家深刻地认识到只顾生活、不顾生产，只管眼前、不看将来，实质上是不要继续大跃进的一种危险的右倾思想。当这个真理被广大群众掌握以后，冬季生产高潮一浪高一浪。
    历城今年冬季生产的特点是：计划先进，规模大，来势猛，各路大军旗开全胜。历城县委计划今冬动员十五万人大兴水利，大中小型工程一齐抓，大干一冬春，基本实现水利化，使五十四万亩小麦保证有四十五万亩无雨保丰收。现在已有六万人上阵，有七处容水量一亿方以上的较大工程和二十处小型水利工程、七十多眼机井工程全部开工。五十四万亩麦田已修好畦田五十万亩，其中达到园田化标准的二十多万亩。各人民公社的麦田管理大军正在制定小麦管理计划，实行管理计划到田，冬季普浇两次水（盘墩、封冻），普追一次肥。翻地积肥等等都比去年同期更多更好。去年今日还在种麦，现在已冬翻地二多万亩，为小麦冬季追肥积了五亿多斤肥料。
    多种经营战线上也十分活跃。县委计划第四季度大搞副业，使副业总产值达到一千四百万多元，全县六十万人口平均每人增加收入将近二十四元。而10月上半月即收入一百六十万元，比9月上半月增加一倍。全县现有十一万头猪，计划到年底增加到十四万头，而10月上半月即增加了四千二百多头。
    这种连续跃进的形势，使一些看来是无法克服的困难迎刃而解。这个县按今冬的生产规划计算，尚缺八百多万个劳动日。但是历城县人民并未因此缩小计划，反而把它作为推进工具改革的动力，展开了一个工具半机械化、改良化的新高潮。
