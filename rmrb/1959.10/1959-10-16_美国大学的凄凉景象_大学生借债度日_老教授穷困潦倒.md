　　The Bleak Scene of American Universities
    College Students Living on Debt, Old Professors Impoverished
    According to a recent report in "U.S. News & World Report," the amount of loans taken out by American college students has tripled in the past four years. In the 1955-1956 academic year, it was $40 million, and in the 1959-1960 academic year it will increase to $120 million. It is estimated that in the 1962-1963 academic year, this figure will increase to $300 million.
    Taking Harvard University as an example, in the 1948-1949 academic year, the number of loans taken out by students at the school was $10,000, in the 1952-1953 academic year it was $76,000, and in 1958 it increased to $400,000.
    In addition to the federal government and some schools, most of the lenders to college students are banks that see college students as investment targets. The interest rate on loans is 4%, sometimes as high as 6.5%. College students who borrow money usually have to repay it within three years after graduation.
    "U.S. News & World Report" claims that the prevalence of long-term loans for college students will cause tuition to rise, and for college students, more and more people are already heavily indebted when they leave school.
    The American "Christian Science Monitor" recently published an article entitled "Economic Tendency; The Impoverished Life of Professors After Retirement," stating that according to a survey of 3,617 retired professors, 78% of them had an average monthly income of less than $100 - many with an average of only $40 per month, others $61 per month, and the better off $166 per month. The newspaper listed some of the statements of those surveyed:
    "We cannot live on a monthly income of $100. We only eat one meal a day. Sometimes I cry alone. I taught for twenty-four years, shouldn't I be better rewarded?"
    "After teaching for twenty years, my monthly retirement pension is sixty dollars... With prices so high and no other income, I don't know how I can get enough money to survive." (Le Shan)

### 美国大学的凄凉景象  大学生借债度日　老教授穷困潦倒

　　美国大学的凄凉景象
    大学生借债度日　老教授穷困潦倒
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”最近报道，四年以来，美国大学生借款的数额增加了三倍。1955—1956学年，为四千万美元，1959—1960学年将增为一亿二千万美元。估计1962—1963学年，这个数字将增为三亿美元。
    以哈佛大学为例，1948—1949学年，该校大学生借款数目为一万美元，1952—1953学年为七万六千美元，1958年增为四十万美元。
    向大学生贷款的除了联邦政府和若干学校以外，大多数是以大学生为投资对象的银行。贷款的利息为4％，有时高达6.5％，借款的大学生通常应于毕业后三年以内偿清。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”称，大学生长期贷款的盛行，将造成学费的上涨，而对大学生说来，愈来愈多的人在离开校门的时候，就已经成为一个债台高筑的负债者了。
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”不久以前在一篇题为“经济倾向；教授们退休后的贫困生活”的文章说，根据对三千六百一十七名退休教授的调查，其中78％每月平均收入不到一百美元——有许多人每月平均仅四十美元，其他一些人每月六十一美元，较好的每月一百六十六美元。该报列举了一些被调查者的陈述：
    “我们无法靠每月一百美元的收入维持生活。我们每天只吃一顿饭。有时我一个人哭泣，我教了二十四年的书，难道我不应该得到较好的报酬。”
    “在教了二十年书以后，我每月退休养老金是六十美元……物价这样高而别无其他收入，我不知道怎样能够获得足够的钱，来维持生活。”　（乐山）
