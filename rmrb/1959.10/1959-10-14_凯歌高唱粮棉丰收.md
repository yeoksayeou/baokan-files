	(Our dispatch from Changsha, October 13th) Hunan Province has entered the busy season of autumn harvest. About five to six million male and female commune members across the province are engaged in the intense autumn harvest battle and preparations to ensure a successful final battle for this year's overall bumper harvest.
	Currently, from the plains of Dongting Lake to the foothills of the southern Wuling Mountains, a joyful scene of celebrating the harvest prevails everywhere. Nearly half of the province's five million mu of single-season late rice has been harvested and stored, with an average yield per unit exceeding that of this year's mid-season rice. Yiyang County, which suffered more than 100 days of drought, has harvested more than 30,000 mu of single-season late rice, with an average yield of 576 jin of dry rice per mu, an increase of 20 percent over last year's relatively good harvest. The Xintianhu Production Team of the Ya Hongqiao Commune in You County harvested 32 mu of single-season late rice, with an average yield of 1,200 jin per mu. In Chen County and Hengyang Prefecture, more than 20,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes have been harvested, generally yielding more than 3,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per mu. In addition, good news of bumper harvests has been reported for cash crops such as cotton and jute, autumn miscellaneous grains such as corn and sorghum, and oil crops such as oil tea. Most of the province's 13 million mu of double-season late rice has also begun to ripen, and a full harvest is expected in mid-October. This year, the output of double-season late rice in the province is expected to greatly exceed that of previous years. The slogan "Late rice surpasses early rice" has become a reality in many places. This is the first miracle of its kind in the history of Hunan rice.
	This year, Hunan's late autumn crops are growing well, with many varieties, a large harvesting area, and a very arduous harvesting task. In the one-month period from now until the first half of November, the province needs to harvest more than 50 million mu of late autumn grain crops, oil tea, tung oil, and cash crops. The proportion of output recovered in this month to the annual output is: grain crops account for nearly half, oil crops account for about 80%, cotton accounts for half, and other cash crops are almost entirely harvested during this period. To this end, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee jointly issued instructions on doing a good job in the autumn harvest, requiring Party committees at all levels to take the autumn harvest as the central task of rural areas in the next month or so, implement political leadership, mobilize the vast number of cadres and masses, and immediately devote themselves to the autumn harvest battle to ensure the crops that should be processed are harvested, stored, and handled well, achieving careful harvesting and threshing, and ensuring that every grain is stored in granaries. It also requires all localities to give full play to the great superiority of the people's communes in unifying and allocating labor on a larger scale, ranking crops, comprehensively planning, and uniformly arranging labor, and organizing necessary large-scale labor cooperation in a planned manner to achieve timely harvesting. At present, the people's communes in many areas are ready and fully engaged in the intense autumn harvest battle.
	According to Jiangxi Daily, good news of the bumper harvest of more than 6.8 million mu of single-season late rice in Jiangxi Province has been pouring in. As of October 6, the province had harvested more than 740,000 mu of single-season late rice, with a much higher yield per mu than last year.
	This year's single-season late rice generally has large heads, long ears, and full grains, surpassing any previous year. Gao'an County, which used to have low yields of single-season late rice, has 210,000 mu of single-season late rice this year, all growing three feet tall with long ears and full grains. The harvested rice has a per mu yield more than double that of last year. Pingxiang County has harvested 15,000 mu of late rice, which, after threshing and acceptance, has a per mu yield 60% higher than last year. The 324 mu of late rice in the Baizhu Commune of this county yielded 688 jin per mu. The 193 mu of late rice harvested by the Tefeng Brigade of the Longmen Commune in Yongxin County, located in the deep mountains, yielded 480 jin per mu, more than three times the yield before liberation. At present, commune members in all people's communes across the province are joyfully continuing to carefully harvest single-season late rice, striving for high yields and bumper harvests, ensuring that every grain returns home.
	According to Ningxia Daily, with abundant millet harvests and piles of rice stacks, the first battle of the autumn harvest in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been won. On October 5, good news came that all 800,000 mu of rice in the irrigation area of ​​Pingchuan, known as the land of fish and rice, had been harvested; the early autumn crops in the southern mountainous area, which is rich in millet, had also been basically harvested. While continuing to rush to harvest, the vast number of Hui and Han commune members have turned to the battle of rushing to transport and thresh crops, determined to thresh quickly and carefully, achieving both high yield and a bumper harvest, and realizing complete success throughout the year. According to the harvesting and threshing situation in twelve counties and cities in the Yinchuan, Yongning, and Jinji irrigation areas, it is estimated that the total rice output can increase by more than 40% compared with last year.
	The great autumn harvest once again demonstrates the strong vitality of the people's communes. As early as before the autumn harvest, the farm tool repair factories, workshops, or groups of people's communes in various places manufactured and repaired a large number of tools such as sickles, vehicles, ropes, and pitchforks. At the same time, all labor and animal power were organized into specialized teams for harvesting, transporting, and threshing. After the autumn crops gradually matured, yellow fields were immediately ranked, and the method of "harvesting as soon as it turns yellow, harvesting in September and October" was adopted to fully engage in the autumn harvest battle. Following closely behind the army of harvesting and threshing, teams for re-harvesting and re-threshing were active in the fields and threshing grounds, launching a climax of re-harvesting and re-threshing, striving not to lose a single grain and to bring back all the abundant grain.

　　凯歌高唱粮棉丰收
　　湖南五百万男女社员奔驰秋收战场保证打好最后一仗
　　江西农民喜气洋洋细收六百万亩谷粒饱满的一季晚稻
　　宁夏各族社员紧张抢收抢运抢打力争实现全年满堂红
    本报长沙13日电　湖南省进入秋收大忙季节。全省每天约有五、六百万名男女社员投入紧张的秋收战斗和秋收准备工作，保证打好今年全面丰收的最后一仗。
    现在，从洞庭湖滨平原到南部五岭山麓，到处洋溢着一片喜庆丰收的欢腾景象。全省五百多万亩一季晚稻，已将近有一半收割进仓，平均单位产量超过今年中稻产量。曾连续遭受一百多天干旱威胁的益阳县已收割的三万多亩一季晚稻，平均每亩收干谷五百七十六斤，较大丰收的去年又增产两成。攸县丫红桥公社新田湖生产队三十二亩一季晚稻，平均亩产一千二百斤。郴县、衡阳两专区收割的两万多亩夏红薯，一般每亩产鲜薯三千多斤。此外，棉花、黄麻等经济作物，玉米、高粱等秋杂作物和油茶等油料作物，大都在收割中传来丰收喜讯。全省一千三百多万亩双季晚稻也大部分开始黄熟，10月中旬即将全面收割。今年全省双季晚稻产量，预计可以大大超过往年。“晚稻赛早稻”的口号，在许多地方已成为事实。这在湖南水稻史上，还是第一次出现的奇迹。
    今年湖南晚秋作物生长好，项目多，收割面积大，收割任务很艰巨。从现在起到11月上半月的一个多月时间内，全省需要收回的晚秋粮食作物和油茶、油桐、经济作物总共有五千多万亩。在这一个多月内收回的产量占全年产量的比重是：粮食作物将近占一半，油料约占80％，棉花也占到一半，其他经济作物几乎是全部集中在这个时期收割。为此，中共湖南省委、湖南省人民委员会联合发布了关于作好秋收工作的指示，要求各级党委在最近一个多月内以秋收作为农村中心工作，实行政治挂帅，发动广大干部和群众，立即投入秋收战斗，保证收好、藏好、处理好应加工的作物，做到细打细收，颗粒归仓。并要求各地充分发挥人民公社能在更大范围内统一调配劳动力的巨大优越性，进行作物排队，全面规划，统一安排劳动力，有计划地组织必要的劳力大协作，做到适时收割。现在，许多地区的人民公社已经准备就绪，全力投入紧张的秋收战斗。
    据江西日报消息　江西省六百八十多万亩一季晚稻丰收捷报频传。到10月6日，全省已经收割了七十四万多亩一季晚稻，亩产量比去年大大增长。
    今年的一季晚稻，普遍长得兜大穗长，谷粒饱满，赛过以往任何一年。过去一季晚稻产量不高的高安县，今年二十一万亩一季晚稻，都长得株高三尺，穗长粒饱，已经收下来的稻谷，亩产量比去年增长一倍以上。萍乡县已收割的一万五千亩晚稻，经过脱粒验收，亩产比去年增长六成。这个县的白竺公社的三百二十四亩晚稻，亩产达六百八十八斤。地处深山的永新县龙门公社特丰大队收割的一百九十三亩晚稻，亩产四百八十斤，比解放前增产三倍多。目前，全省各个人民公社社员正喜气洋洋地继续精心收割一季晚稻，力争丰产丰收，颗粒回家。
    据宁夏日报消息　糜谷丰登，稻垛成山，宁夏回族自治区秋收第一个战役已经获胜。10月5日传来捷报，被称为鱼米之乡的灌区平川八十多万亩水稻已经全部登场；盛产糜谷的南部山区早秋作物也基本收完。广大回汉族社员在继续抢收的同时，转入了抢运抢打战斗，决心打快打细，做到丰产又丰收，实现全年满堂红。根据银川、永宁、金积等灌区十二个县市收割打场情况估计，水稻总产量可比去年增长四成以上。
    秋田大丰收，再一次显示了人民公社强大的生命力。早在秋收前，各地人民公社的农具修配厂、车间或小组，就制做和修理了大批镰刀、车辆、绳子、叉丫等工具。同时还把所有的劳畜力组成了收割、拉运、打场等专业队。秋季作物陆续成熟以后，立即进行了黄田排队，采取“随黄随收、九黄十收”的办法，全力投入了秋收战斗。紧跟在收割碾打大军之后，复收复打的队伍又活跃在田间、场上，掀起了一个复收复打的高潮，争取颗粒不丢，把丰产的粮食全部拿回来。（附图片）
