The old cotton-growing region is striving for grain self-sufficiency with guaranteed yields. The Nantong Special District is carrying out a multi-party joint emulation campaign for high yields of summer crops.

(By our newspaper) News: In Nantong Special District, Jiangsu Province, various regions are launching autumn sowing multi-party joint emulation campaigns, striving for overall high yields in the next summer harvest and laying the foundation for the old cotton-growing region to have a surplus of grain for the entire year. The people of Nantong Special District are filled with enthusiasm and high spirits, and are now enthusiastically throwing themselves into the autumn sowing movement under the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

Nantong Special District has a large proportion of land dedicated to cotton and other special economic crops, and has historically relied on the state for grain supply. This year, thanks to the implementation of the policy of giving equal importance to grain and cotton, grain production has seen a great leap forward, and grain imports have been reduced by half compared to the past. Recently, inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of Nantong Special District have widely discussed the leap forward plan for next year. Everyone has expressed their determination to strive for grain self-sufficiency with a surplus next year, with grain and cotton taking the lead and driving the overall high yields of other economic crops, in order to support the country's socialist construction with greater strength. Based on the results of discussions among cadres and the masses in various places, the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has planned to increase total grain output by 30% next year compared to this year. To this end, the area sown to summer crops will be increased by more than 1.3 million mu this autumn, requiring a 65.8% increase in total summer grain output. Based on the soil, water conservancy, and stubble conditions in the entire district, it has been decided that about 30% of the area will be used as basic fields, with a yield of 450 jin per mu, and the remaining large fields will yield 260 jin per mu.

In order to realize the grand plan for a greater leap forward in the next summer harvest, the Prefectural Committee and the County Committees of various counties have summarized the experience of carrying out mass movements in the past and decided to launch a multi-party joint emulation campaign throughout the district. This joint emulation was initiated by fifteen people's communes in Nantong, Rudong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Haian and other counties. Their slogan is "Sweep away Rightism, boost morale, ensure overall high yields in the summer harvest, and win the district championship." Two hundred and twenty-eight communes throughout the district quickly and enthusiastically responded to this initiative, and, based on their specific circumstances, determined different measures and invested in the autumn sowing joint emulation. Units participating in the overall competition can also participate in separate competitions for high yields of wheat, naked barley, barley, broad beans, rapeseed, and green manure, depending on the circumstances; in addition, there are boundary competitions between neighboring counties and communes, competitions for poor teams to turn themselves around, competitions to eliminate third-class seedlings, competitions to implement the "Eight-Character Charter," competitions to care for the lives of the masses, competitions for tool reforms, competitions for breeding and maintaining draught animals, competitions for running community-run industries well, competitions for comprehensively developing forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and competitions for autumn sowing on farms. There are a total of twelve competition items. Each item has one or several communes with roughly the same conditions participating and jointly issuing a proposal, hence the name joint emulation. Because this kind of competition is based on the conditions and needs of each commune to participate in different competition items, it enables people to learn from each other's strengths, cooperate with each other, help each other, and improve together in their respective competition items. In the "poor team turnaround" competition, poor teams in Caiyan, Huzhi, and other communes in Rugao County put forward the slogan "Poor people have high aspirations" and resolved to strive for a multiple increase in the summer harvest and surpass the rich teams. They engaged in deep plowing, soil improvement, and large-scale fertilizer accumulation in the autumn sowing. After launching a boundary competition in the edge areas of the county and commune, some remote areas that were often overlooked in the past have also strengthened their leadership and are determined to catch up with and surpass the central areas in the autumn sowing. In the past, an important factor affecting the overall high yield of the summer harvest was third-class seedlings. The reasons for the third-class seedlings are: first, poor soil quality; second, late stubble and late sowing; and third, lack of fertilizer. In the competition to strive for overall high yield, each commune also made "eliminating third-class seedlings in the sowing stage" a competition item.

In the multi-party joint emulation, various places have further studied the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, greatly boosted their morale, and engaged in mass movements on a large scale. Technical promotion groups were established, and professional teams for various summer harvest crops were organized to tightly link each link in accordance with technical operating procedures, leaving no room for error, and grasping from sowing to harvesting to the end. From now until next wheat harvest, each commune and the targets of the hookup competition will be divided into four stages for inspection and comparison. The first stage, which starts now, mainly inspects whether the autumn sowing area implements the national plan, whether the three guarantees are implemented, whether the arrangement of base fertilizer, seeds, tools, and stubble meets the requirements, and whether the technical operating procedures are reasonable. The second stage is to carry out the "Six Goods" assessment of autumn sowing: first, compare whether seed treatment is good, emergence is complete, and germination rate is high; second, compare whether deep plowing is fast and of good quality; third, compare whether sufficient base fertilizer is applied and the fertilizer quality is good; fourth, compare whether stubble is reasonably matched and the specifications and quality are good; fifth, compare whether many improved agricultural implements are used and the work efficiency is good; and sixth, compare whether labor is reasonably organized and the equivalent exchange cooperation is good. The third and fourth stages will promote field management in the main production stages of summer crops through "three checks and three comparisons."

At present, communes throughout the district have held cadres and members' meetings, established competition command organizations, discussed specific competition measures, and carried out on-site promotion of autumn sowing. After launching a single competition to compare tool reforms, Huilong Commune in Qidong County immediately repaired 240 winches and held two consecutive on-site deep plowing meetings, greatly improving the efficiency of deep plowing. Every three people pushing a winch can deep plow one mu in six hours, with a depth of more than seven inches. It is estimated that the commune's autumn sowing can be completed ten days earlier than last year. After the competition was launched by Shijie Commune in Nantong, the base fertilizer for each mu of wheat field has increased from more than 100 dan to more than 300 dan, and seed soaking with lime water is commonly used. In order to compete with other communes to implement the "Eight-Character Charter," Caiyan Commune in Rugao insisted on the quality specifications of autumn sowing, planted six specifications of wheat, and organized each team to visit the site to criticize Right-leaning ideas in technology. At the same time, many counties, communes, and teams have launched large-scale cooperation in the competition. The areas in Haian County that sow rice early are lagging behind in labor and tools, and the cotton areas that sow late have taken the initiative to provide support. Chengxi Commune in Rugao has signed a specific autumn sowing cooperation contract with its competition opponent, Caiyan Commune.

　　老棉区力争粮食自给确良
    南通专区开展夏熟作物高产多项联名竞赛
    本报讯　江苏南通专区各地掀起秋播多项联名竞赛运动，力争明年夏熟全面高产，打下老棉区全年粮食自给有余的基础。南通专区人民热情洋溢，意气风发，目前正在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面大红旗下，轰轰烈烈地投入秋播运动。
    南通专区种植棉花和其他特种经济作物比例很大，历年依靠国家供应粮食。今年由于执行了粮棉并举的方针，粮食产量大跃进，调进的粮食比过去减少一半。最近，南通专区人民在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，普遍讨论了明年的跃进规划，大家都表示要在粮棉带头，带动其他经济作物全面高产的方针下，力争明年粮食自给有余，用更大的力量支援国家的社会主义建设。中共南通地委根据各地干部群众讨论的结果，规划明年粮食总产量比今年增加30％。为此，今年秋种增加夏熟作物面积一百三十多万亩，要求夏熟粮食总产量增加65.8％。根据全区的土壤、水利和茬口等条件，决定以30％左右的面积，作为基本田，亩产四百五十斤，其余的大田亩产二百六十斤。
    为了实现明年夏熟更大跃进的宏伟规划，地委和各县县委总结了过去大搞群众运动的经验，决定在全区范围内，开展一个多项联名竞赛运动。这个联名竞赛是由南通、如东、海门、启东、如?、海安等县十五个人民公社联名发起的。他们的口号是“横扫右倾、大鼓干劲，确保夏熟全面高产，夺取全区冠军。”全区很快就有二百二十八个公社热烈响应这个倡议，分别根据自己的具体情况，确定不同的措施，投入了秋播联名竞赛。参加全面竞赛的单位，还可以根据不同情况分别参加小麦、元麦、大麦、蚕豌豆、油菜、绿肥等单项高产的分项竞赛；此外还有邻县邻社之间的边界竞赛、穷队翻身竞赛、消灭三类苗竞赛，比执行“八字宪法”、比关心群众生活、比工具改革、比繁殖保养耕畜、比办好社办工业、比全面发展林牧副渔、比农场秋播等竞赛。一共有十二个竞赛项目。每个项目都有一个以至几个条件大体相同的公社参加，联名发出倡议，所以叫联名竞赛。由于这种竞赛是根据各个公社的条件和需要，参加不同项目的竞赛，就可以使人能在各自不同的竞赛项目中取长补短，彼此协作，相互帮助，共同提高。在“穷队翻身”的竞赛中，如?县蔡炎、胡芝等公社的穷队提出“人穷志气高”的口号，决心争取夏熟增产幅度成倍上升，并超过富队。他们在秋播中大搞深翻，改良土壤，大积肥料。在县、社边缘地区开展边际竞赛后，一些地处偏远过去常被人们忽视的地区，也都加强了领导，决心在秋播中赶上并超过中心地区。历年来，影响夏熟全面高产的重要因素是三类苗。造成三类苗的原因，一是土质差，二是茬口晚、播种迟，三是缺肥。在争取全面高产的竞赛中，各公社又将“消灭三类苗在播种阶段”作为一个竞赛项目。
    各地在多项联名竞赛中，又进一步学习了八届八中全会精神，大鼓干劲，大搞群众运动。建立技术推广团，组织夏熟各项作物的专业队伍，按照技术操作规程，环环扣紧，一步不让，从种到收，一抓到底。从目前起到明年麦收止，各公社以及挂钩竞赛的对象之间，划分四段进行检查评比。第一段，目前就开始，主要是检查秋播面积是否执行国家计划，三包是否落实，基肥、种子、工具、茬口安排是否合乎要求，技术操作规程是否合理。第二段，开展秋播“六好”评比；一比种子处理好，出苗齐，发芽率高；二比深翻速度快，质量好；三比基肥下得足，肥料质量好；四比茬口搭配合理，规格质量好；五比改良农具用得多，提高工效好；六比合理组织劳力、等价交换协作好。第三、第四段将通过“三查三比”，促进夏熟作物各主要生产阶段的田间管理。
    目前全区各公社都分别召开了干部社员大会，建立了竞赛指挥机构，讨论了竞赛的具体措施，进行了秋播工作的现场促进。启东县汇龙公社在开展比工具改革的单项竞赛后，立即整修了二百四十部绞关犁，并连续举行二次深翻现场会议，大大提高了深翻工效，每三个人推绞关犁，六小时就可深翻一亩，深度在七寸以上，预计全社秋播可比去年提早十天完成。南通石港公社发起竞赛后，每亩麦田基肥已由一百多担增积到三百多担，并普遍用石灰水浸种。如?蔡炎公社为了和别的公社比赛执行“八字宪法”，坚持秋播质量规格，播了六种规格的麦子，组织各队实地参观，通过参观，批判技术上的右倾思想。同时，有许多县、社、队已在竞赛中展开了大协作，海安县早播种的水稻区劳力工具跟不上，迟播种的棉区就主动进行支援，如?县城西公社并和竞赛对手蔡炎公社具体签订了秋播协作合同。
