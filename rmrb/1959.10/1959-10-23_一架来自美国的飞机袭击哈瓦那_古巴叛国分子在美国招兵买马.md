Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 21st - On the evening of the same day that Cuban armed forces crushed the counter-revolutionary plot led by Matos in Camagüey Province on the 21st, a plane from the United States attacked Havana.

This plane, coming from Florida in the United States, scattered reactionary leaflets over Havana, dropped shrapnel bombs, and strafed the city. Simultaneously, terrorist activities occurred in some areas of the capital, with terrorists throwing bombs from jeeps and shooting at residents. The plane attack resulted in two deaths and twenty-eight injuries among Havana residents. Revolutionary Air Force planes engaged the attacking plane in aerial combat and drove it away. The reactionary leaflets were signed by the traitor and former Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz, who is in the United States. He used the pretext that the Cuban government is a "communist" government to incite anti-government activities. Havana residents collected the leaflets and burned them in piles.

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st - Havana News: According to a New York dispatch published in the Cuban "National Daily" on the 20th, the former police chief of the dictatorship, Folcon, has, under the protection of the US authorities, established a headquarters in New York and is engaged in recruiting personnel.
