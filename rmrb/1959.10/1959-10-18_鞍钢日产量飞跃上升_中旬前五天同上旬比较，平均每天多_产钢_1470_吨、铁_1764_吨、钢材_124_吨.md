Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 17th. After achieving a flying start in production in the first ten days of October, Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) saw another sharp increase in the production of steel, pig iron, and steel products from the 11th to the 15th. During these five days, the average daily increase in steel was 1,470 tons compared to the first ten days, pig iron increased by 1,764 tons, and steel products increased by 124 tons.

In order to complete the new struggle targets of increasing national production by 250,000 tons of steel and 400,000 tons of steel products this year, all the iron and steel forces of An'gang have further set off a vigorous upsurge in technical performance competitions. The An'gang Party Committee decided to launch a joint technical performance competition week throughout the company from October 15th to 21st. On the first day of the Great Performance Competition Week—the 15th—the workers were full of energy, and production was victorious across the board. Steel exceeded the daily production plan by 1,572 tons, pig iron exceeded by 297 tons, and steel products exceeded by 1,427 tons. Zhan Jiangong, a furnace technician from the Ironmaking Plant, came to the No. 9 blast furnace and performed rapid iron tapping technology with the workers. In the past, it took one hour to tap a furnace of iron, but this performance took only 37 minutes. On this day, the No. 9 blast furnace produced 2,421 tons of pig iron, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient reached 2.565. The first, second, and third shifts of the First Thin Plate Mill selected 57 outstanding steel rolling experts to launch a great technical performance competition on the No. 2 rolling mill, and the effect was very significant. The third shift overproduced by 36%, the first shift overproduced by 28%, and the second shift leapt to overproduction by 97%. The Party Secretary and Director of the Second Steelmaking Plant went deep into the site to participate in and direct the performance. Director He Jin performed with the workers on the No. 16 open-hearth furnace, learning from the advanced experience of the First Steelmaking Plant in exchanging molten iron, expanding the furnace's charge capacity from 340 tons to 380 tons.

Before the start of the performance competition week, the Party committees of various factories and mines in An'gang held various meetings to make full preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and material foundation. All units and systems have formulated specific measures in conjunction with the key points of their respective departments.

　　鞍钢日产量飞跃上升
    中旬前五天同上旬比较，平均每天多
    产钢1470吨、铁1764吨、钢材124吨
    新华社鞍山17日电　鞍钢在10月上旬实现了生产开门红以后，从11日到15日，钢、生铁、钢材的产量又有了猛烈上升。这五天，钢平均每天比上旬增长一千四百七十吨，生铁增长一千七百六十四吨，钢材增长一百二十四吨。
    为了完成今年为国家增产二十五万吨钢和四十万吨钢材的新的奋斗指标，鞍钢各路钢铁大军进一步掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术表演赛的热潮。鞍钢党委决定从10月15日到21日，在全公司范围内开展一个联合技术大表演竞赛周。在大表演竞赛周开始的第一天——15日，职工们干劲冲天，生产全线告捷，钢超过日产计划一千五百七十二吨，生铁超过二百九十七吨，钢材超过一千四百二十七吨。炼铁厂炉前技师詹建功来到九号高炉上，和工人一道进行快速出铁技术表演，过去出一炉铁需要一小时，这次表演只用三十七分钟就出完了。这一天，九号高炉生产生铁二千四百二十一吨，高炉利用系数达到二点五六五。第一薄板厂甲、乙、丙班选出五十七名优秀轧钢能手，在第二号轧钢机上展开了技术表演大竞赛，效果十分显著。丙班超产36％，甲班超产28％，乙班一跃超产97％。第二炼钢厂党委书记、厂长都深入现场实地参加表演和指挥表演。厂长何进在十六号平炉上和工人一道表演，学习第一炼钢厂兑铁水的先进经验，使这个炉装入量由三百四十吨扩大到三百八十吨。
    在表演竞赛周开始以前，鞍钢各厂矿党委都分别召开了各种会议，从思想上、组织上和物质基础上作了充分准备。各单位和各系统都结合本部门的关键订出具体措施。
