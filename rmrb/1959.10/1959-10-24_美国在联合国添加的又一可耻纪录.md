Another Shameful Record Added by the United States at the United Nations
Xinhua News Agency Commentary

Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the United Nations General Assembly illegally passed the so-called "Tibetan Question" proposal on the 21st. The international reactionaries, headed by U.S. imperialism, have added another shameful record to the United Nations of grossly interfering in China's internal affairs and trampling on the United Nations Charter.

The United States, holding a group of its puppet states, created the so-called "Tibetan Question" in the United Nations and vigorously attacked China. However, everyone knows that Tibet is an integral part of China's sacred territory, and no foreign country has the right to interfere in China's internal affairs. The imperialists want to instigate opposition to China on this issue, which is purely China's internal affair. This obviously cannot be justified. Even at the United Nations General Assembly, some representatives of Western countries, while attacking China together with the United States, also felt guilty and openly admitted that the United Nations' discussion of the so-called "Tibetan Question" violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter that prohibit interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and that the United Nations has no right to discuss this issue.

In order to incite hostile actions against China, the imperialists deliberately disguise themselves as "humanitarians." In their speeches and adopted proposals, they loudly clamor that China is "forcibly depriving basic human rights and freedoms" in Tibet, "destroying traditional ways of life," and disrupting "a just world order." However, they dare not say a word about what kind of "way of life" and "world order" they are opposing the destruction of, and what kind of "human rights" and "freedom" they are defending. The fact is that after China put down the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, the Tibetan people are eliminating the most backward, cruel, and barbaric serf system that has been weighing on them for generations, and are gaining the right and freedom to truly be human beings. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, those big serf owners, have sought refuge with imperialism and foreign reactionaries and betrayed their motherland, precisely in an attempt to forever maintain their "rights" and "freedom" to oppress and slaughter serfs in an extremely barbaric and cruel manner, but they have failed. U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept this. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Wilcox publicly instructed the Tibetan rebel group to continue its activities on October 18, declaring that the United States hopes that the United Nations' discussion will help Tibet "continue its efforts to maintain their way of life." The imperialists are wholeheartedly trying to maintain the serf system in Tibet and their "freedom" to interfere in the local Tibet of China. This is merely an extension of their barbaric racial discrimination at home and their brutal colonial oppression policies in other parts of the world. These talks about "human rights" and "freedom" by the imperialists can only further demonstrate that they are the enemies of the true liberation of all ethnic groups in China, especially the Tibetan people, and they are supporters of all the darkest cannibalistic systems. Recently, when the international situation is showing a tendency to ease, U.S. imperialism has used all kinds of despicable means to force the so-called "Tibetan Question" onto the UN agenda, forcing the United Nations General Assembly to discuss it. This clearly shows that certain powerful groups in the United States are making every effort to continue to incite and exacerbate the "Cold War" in order to resist the easing of the international situation. Faced with the strong emotions of world public opinion demanding the easing of international tensions, U.S. government officials have recently made some gestures expressing their desire to thaw the Cold War ice. Based on this, a British "Daily Express" blamed the United States and other Western countries for initiating the so-called "Tibetan Question" discussion, calling it "a foolish and ill-timed debate." In fact, imperialism is imperialism, and it always does stupid things. The shameless acts in the United Nations can only expose the true colors of the imperialists. What the United States has done in the United Nations is a link in its conspiracy to intensify the creation of new tensions in the East.

At this United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries conducted a righteous and stern struggle, powerfully exposing the reactionary attempts and ugly faces of those who raised the so-called "Tibetan Question," causing the United States and its followers to go bankrupt politically.

The United States put a lot of effort into arranging this discussion in the United Nations, but the result did not create the "momentum" it had originally envisioned, but reflected its isolation and weakness. The United States' initial activities to find American pawns to put forward the so-called "Tibetan Question" proposal were not smooth. It had to use Ireland and Malaya as vanguards, and they themselves felt unjustified and lacking confidence. Irish Foreign Minister Aiken himself admitted that doing so was "unfavorable" to the current more favorable international atmosphere. Because the proposal was opposed and coldly received, it had to be revised repeatedly. The United States spent a lot of effort, repeatedly exerting pressure behind the scenes, and finally the proposal was passed with more than twenty countries abstaining.

The so-called "Tibetan Question" proposal passed by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States is completely illegal and invalid. All actions hostile to the Chinese people will only end up hurting themselves and will only arouse greater hatred and opposition from the Chinese people towards imperialism. Some countries that have diplomatic relations with China, such as Britain, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, voted to support the Irish and Malayan proposals in the United Nations during the discussion and voting process of including the so-called "Tibetan Question" on the agenda and passing the resolution. This action cannot but make the Chinese people feel regret and indignation. However, Tibet is China's Tibet. No matter what kind of slander and interference in China's internal affairs the United States and its followers use the United Nations to pass, it will not change the inevitable process of historical development in Tibet and the simple fact that Tibet belongs to China in the slightest. No matter how the international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism clamor, backwardness and darkness will be eliminated in the great reform movement of the Tibetan people, and happiness and light will shine all over Tibet!

    美国在联合国添加的又一可耻纪录
    新华社记者述评
    在美帝国主义的操纵下，联合国大会21日非法通过了所谓“西藏问题”的提案。以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，给联合国添加了又一个粗暴干涉中国内政、践踏联合国宪章的可耻纪录。
    美国挟持一批仆从国家，在联合国里制造所谓“西藏问题”，大肆攻击中国。但是，谁都知道，西藏是中国神圣领土的一部分，任何外国都无权干涉中国的内部事务。帝国主义要在这个纯属中国内政的问题上鼓动反对中国，显然是立足不住的，甚至在联合国大会上，也有某些西方国家代表，一面同美国一道攻击中国，一面又作贼心虚，公开承认联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”是违反联合国宪章里不得干涉各国内部事务的规定的，联合国没有权力讨论这个问题。
    帝国主义者为了煽惑起敌视中国的行动，故意把自己装扮成为“人道主义者”，在他们的发言和通过的提案中，大事叫嚷中国在西藏“强行剥夺基本人权和自由”，“摧毁传统生活方式”，破坏“公正的世界秩序”。然而，他们根本一句话也不敢谈到他们是在反对摧毁什么样的“生活方式”和“世界秩序”，又是在维护什么样的“人权”和“自由”。事实是，在中国平息西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱以后，西藏人民正在消灭世世代代压在他们身上的最落后、最残酷、最野蛮的农奴制度，正在获得真正做人的权利和自由。西藏上层反动集团，那些大农奴主们，投靠帝国主义和外国反动派，背叛祖国，便是企图永远保持他们那些极其野蛮残酷地压迫和屠杀农奴的“权利”和“自由”，不过他们失败了。美帝国主义对这一点是不甘心的。美国助理国务卿威耳科克斯10月18日还公然指使西藏叛匪集团继续活动，宣称美国希望联合国的讨论有助于使西藏“保持他们的生活方式的努力”“继续下去”。帝国主义一心想保持西藏的农奴制度以及他们干涉中国地方西藏的“自由”，这只不过是他们在自己国内实行野蛮的种族歧视和对世界其他地区实行残酷的殖民压迫政策的延伸而已。帝国主义这些“人权”、“自由”的谈论，只能更进一步说明，他们是中国各族人民，特别是西藏人民真正自由解放的敌人，他们是一切最黑暗的吃人制度的支持者。最近国际局势正在出现缓和倾向的时候，美帝国主义竟使用种种卑鄙手段，不顾一切地强把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程，强使联合国大会进行讨论。这清楚地表明，美国有势力集团为了抵制国际局势缓和，正在竭力继续煽动和加剧“冷战”。美国政府人士最近在世界公众要求缓和国际紧张局势的强烈情绪面前，曾作出过一些表示愿望融解冷战冰块等等的姿态。基于这一点，英国有一家“每日快报”责怪美国等西方国家发起所谓“西藏问题”的讨论，是“进行一场愚蠢的时机不对头的辩论”。其实，帝国主义就是帝国主义，它总是要干蠢事的。在联合国里的无耻行径，只能使帝国主义者原形毕露。美国在联合国里所干的勾当，是它加紧在东方制造新的紧张局势的阴谋里的一个环节。
    在这次联合国大会上，苏联和其他社会主义国家进行了义正辞严的斗争，有力地揭露了提出所谓“西藏问题”者的反动企图和丑恶面貌，使得美国及其跟随者在政治上完全破产。
    美帝国主义在联合国里安排这次讨论是煞费心机的，然而结果并没有能够造成它原先设想的“声势”来，却反映出它的孤立和虚弱。美国起初寻找出面提出所谓“西藏问题”提案的美国走卒的活动，就不顺利，只好用上爱尔兰和马来亚充当马前卒，而它们自己也感到理不直、气不壮的。爱尔兰外长埃肯本人就承认这样做是对当前比较有利的国际气氛“不利的”。这个提案由于遭到反对和冷遇，又不得不再三修改。美国费了九牛二虎之力，在幕后一再施加压力，最后才使提案在二十多个国家弃权的情形下获得通过。
    美国操纵联合国通过的所谓“西藏问题”提案，完全是非法的，无效的。一切敌对中国人民的做法，只会搬起石头来砸自己的脚，只能激起中国人民对帝国主义更大的仇恨和反对。一些同中国有着外交关系的国家如英国、荷兰、巴基斯坦、挪威、丹麦和瑞典，这次在联合国里讨论和表决把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程和通过决议的过程中，投票支持爱尔兰和马来亚提案，这个行动不能不使中国人民感到遗憾和愤慨。但是，西藏是中国的西藏，不管美国及其跟随者利用联合国通过什么样诬蔑和干涉中国内政的提案，它丝毫也变动不了西藏历史发展的必然进程和西藏属于中国这一个简单的事实。不管以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派如何叫嚣，落后黑暗将在西藏人民的伟大改革运动中消灭，幸福光明将普照西藏！
