Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator: This reporter learned from the Mongolian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry that Mongolian state farms have achieved a bumper harvest of grain this year. As of mid-October, state farms across the country have completed the autumn harvest on more than 102,000 hectares of cultivated land, harvesting a total of 99,962 tons of grain, an increase of nearly 10,000 tons over the original planned output.

The actual yield per unit area of grain from state farms is also higher than the original target. The average yield per hectare of grain harvested this autumn reached 9.7 quintals, an increase of more than 1 quintal over the original plan. The farms will over fulfill their original planned target of submitting more than 43,000 tons of grain to the state by over 17,000 tons.

State farms have also achieved bumper harvests of potatoes and vegetables. According to statistics, the output of potatoes and vegetables from just four farms has already reached the total planned output of all original farms. Some farms also trial-planted crops that had not been grown in Mongolia in the past. For example, the Zhonghala Farm has achieved bumper harvests in trial plantings of hemp, tobacco, and beets this year.

This year's bumper harvest of crops from Mongolian state farms is the result of the Mongolian Party and government attaching greater importance to the development of agricultural production. Since the beginning of spring this year, large areas of wasteland have been reclaimed throughout Mongolia, and the cultivated area of farms has been expanded. The Mongolian government has sent a large number of agricultural technicians to farms to strengthen technical guidance and management. Soviet experts have also played an important role in the production of Mongolian farms.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, October 25th: According to a report in the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper on October 25th, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers sent a telegram to the experts and workers of state farms, congratulating them on the bumper grain harvest this year.

The telegram stated that with the fraternal and tremendous economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union, and with the active participation of the broad masses of workers in various farms, state enterprises, and students at all levels, the autumn harvest work has been successfully completed. State farms have completed the grain production plan by an average of 123.6%, with wheat production reaching more than 80,000 tons and an average yield of 11 quintals per hectare.

The telegram stated that state farms have achieved great success in the first year of wasteland reclamation, reclaiming a total of 99,672 hectares, exceeding the state-prescribed plan.

The telegram expressed warm congratulations to the farm workers and Soviet experts who achieved the bumper grain harvest and called on the workers to further consolidate their achievements, do a good job in grain storage and autumn plowing, and strive for greater achievements next year.

    蒙古国营农场谷物丰收
    蒙古党和政府电国营农牧场职工祝贺
    新华社乌兰巴托电　本社记者从蒙古农牧业部获悉，今年蒙古国营农牧场的谷物获得丰收。到10月中旬为止，全国国营农牧场已经在十万二千多公顷耕地上完成了秋收工作，共收获谷物九万九千九百六十二吨，比原计划产量增加近一万吨。
    国营农牧场的谷物实际单位面积产量也高于原订的指标。今年秋收的谷物每公顷平均产量达到九点七公担，比原计划增加一公担多。农牧场原计划向国家上交的四万三千多吨粮食，它们将超过一万七千多吨完成任务。
    各个国营农牧场播种的马铃薯、蔬菜也得到丰收。据统计，单是四个农牧场的马铃薯和蔬菜产量就已经达到原来所有农牧场的计划总产量。有些农牧场今年还试种了蒙古过去没有种植过的作物，如中哈拉农牧场今年试种麻类、烟草和甜菜，都获得丰收。
    今年，蒙古国营农牧场农作物获得丰收，是蒙古党和政府更加重视发展农业生产的结果。今年开春以后，蒙古各地大量开垦荒地，农牧场的耕地面积扩大了。蒙古政府派遣大批农业技术人员到农牧场去，加强了农业的技术指导和管理工作。苏联专家对蒙古农牧场的生产也起了重要的作用。
    新华社乌兰巴托25日电　据蒙古“真理报”25日报道，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和部长会议打电报给国营农牧场职工的专家，祝贺他们今年获得了谷物丰收。
    电报说，在苏联兄弟般的巨大的经济技术援助下，在各农牧场职工、国家企业的广大职工以及各级学生积极参加劳动的条件下，秋收工作顺利结束了。各国营农牧场平均以123.6％完成了谷物生产计划，其中小麦生产量达八万多吨，每公顷平均产量达十一公担。
    电报说，国营农牧场在开垦荒地的第一年取得了巨大成就，共开垦荒地九万九千六百七十二公顷，超额完成了国家规定的计划。
    电报向获得谷物丰收的农牧场职工和苏联专家表示热情祝贺，并号召职工们进一步巩固成绩，作好谷物的保管和耕地秋翻工作，争取明年取得更大成就。
