    Life Gets Better and Better
    Yasheng Kurban, Miner of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    Right-leaning opportunists slander that our Party's General Line is wrong and that the Great Leap Forward is a mess. They are just lying through their teeth! We workers know what's really going on. Without the General Line, without the Great Leap Forward, we wouldn't have the happy life we have today.

    I am in my fifties this year and have been working in the mines for twenty years. Before liberation, working in the coal mines was like being a slave. Digging and carrying coal meant no rest. The money we earned wasn't enough to eat. If you got sick or crushed to death, no one cared. After liberation, this old tree of mine was nourished by the spring breeze and blossomed with happy flowers. In the past few years, under the care of the Party and with the patient help of Han comrades, I quickly learned all the new technologies from being an ordinary coal miner, was promoted to a seventh-grade worker and fire extinguishing team leader, and was repeatedly rated as an advanced producer by everyone. Life gets better and better. In the old society, I couldn't even feed myself, how could I have the strength to start a family! I never imagined that I would get married at the age of forty-four after liberation and build a happy family. Before liberation, we people who lived in coal pits and slept on stone blocks now live in new houses with carpets. In order to protect the safety of every miner, the Party also issued work clothes, safety helmets, and rubber boots. If you get sick, you get timely medical treatment.

    Looking at the happy life we have before us, and then looking at the right-leaning opportunists' slander against our Party, I can't help but feel anger in my heart. What are these people up to!

    生活越过越幸福
    新疆维吾尔自治区矿工  牙生·库尔班
    右倾机会主义分子污蔑我们党的总路线错了，大跃进搞糟了，真是睁眼说瞎话！我们工人懂得实际是怎么一回事，没有总路线，没有大跃进，就没有我们今天幸福的生活。
    我今年是五十多岁的人了，在矿井下作了二十年工。解放前在煤窑里劳动就和奴隶一样，挖煤背煤就没有个休息时间，挣的钱还吃不饱肚子，病死、砸死了也没有人过问。解放后，我这棵老树才受了春风的滋养，开出了幸福的花朵。几年来在党的关怀和汉族同志的耐心帮助下，我由一个普通的挖煤工很快地学会了全套新技术，升为七级工和灭火组长，并几次被大伙评为先进生产者，生活越过越幸福。旧社会里我自己的肚子还填不饱，哪有力量成家啊！想不到解放后四十四岁那年我结了婚，建立了幸福家庭。解放前我们这些住煤窝子枕石块的人，现在住上了铺着地毯的新房子。党为了保护每个矿工的安全，还发了工作服、安全帽、胶靴，一有病就及时医疗。
    看着我们眼前幸福的生活，再看看右倾机会主义分子对我们党的污蔑，我就止不住心头的愤怒，这些人到底安的什么心呢！
