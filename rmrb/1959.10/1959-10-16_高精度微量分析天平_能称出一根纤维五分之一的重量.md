　　High-Precision Microbalance
    Can Weigh One-Fifth of a Fiber

    (Our report) China's first millionth-grade high-precision microbalance has been born at the Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory.

    The Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory was formed last year by merging nine small factories and had no engineers. However, all the workers in the factory were full of energy and bold in their ideas. They overcame difficulties such as insufficient data and poor equipment, and finally succeeded in the trial production. It is now on display at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition.

    A millionth-grade microbalance is rarely seen even abroad. This high-precision balance, uniquely designed and manufactured by the Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory, is equipped with a double-layered shell. All operating knobs are installed on the outside of the shell. When in use, the knobs can be rotated, and the relevant device can work automatically, overcoming the shortcomings of the old-fashioned balance, which required opening the shell and using hands to send the substance to be weighed to the weighing pan during operation. This makes the operation easier and reduces the influence of external air vortices, temperature, and humidity on the balance. The maximum weighing capacity of this balance is five grams, and the sensitivity is 0.001 milligrams. Experiments using cotton fibers have shown that if a one-milligram, one-decimeter-long cotton fiber is divided into two hundred fibers, and one-fifth of a single fiber is placed on the weighing pan of the balance, its weight can be read on the projection differential scale. This balance is an indispensable instrument for scientific research institutions, testing units, and universities to conduct highly precise microanalysis and physical experiments.

　　高精度微量分析天平
    能称出一根纤维五分之一的重量
    本报讯　我国第一台百万分之一高精度微量分析天平在上海天平仪器厂诞生。
    上海天平仪器厂是去年由九个小厂合并成立的，没有一个工程师。但全厂职工鼓足干劲、大胆设想，克服了资料不足、设备差等困难，终于试制成功。现已在全国工业交通展览会展出。
    百万分之一微量分析天平在国外也不多见。上海天平仪器厂独创设计、制造的这种高精度天平，设有双层外壳，所有操纵旋钮都安装在外壳外面，使用时旋动旋钮，有关装置即可自动工作，克服了老式天平操作时必须打开外壳，用手把要称的物质送到秤盘上的缺点，这样既便于操作，又可减少外来气涡、温度和湿度对天平的影响。这架天平的最大称量为五克，感量为零点零零一毫克。用棉花纤维作试验证明：把一毫克重一分米长的棉花分成二百根纤维后，取一根纤维的五分之一放在天平的秤物盘上，即可在投影微分标尺上读到它的重量。这种天平是科学研究机关、试验单位和高等学校进行高度精密的微量分析和物理性试验不可缺少的仪器。
