    The Unknown Arsonist
    In one of the states of India, a forest suddenly caught fire one day. People searched for a long time for the culprit who started the fire, but without success. An old forest dweller said that it was a small fragrant flower that caused it. At first, people dismissed his words as a "joke." However, researchers in the laboratory really caught this "culprit." It turned out that this small fragrant flower is a volatile plant, and its stems, leaves, and flowers contain a lot of flammable oil. Therefore, in hot weather, they become arsonists for forest fires. In this way, the old man's words were confirmed.

    不知名的纵火者
    在印度的一个州里，一天，忽然森林起了大火。人们很久没有找到这次纵火的凶手。有一位老林人说，这是一种小小的香花干出的事。起初，人们都把他的话视为“玩笑”。但是，实验室的研究人员真的抓住了这个“凶手”。原来，这种小小的香花是一种挥发性植物，它的茎、叶、花都含有很多易燃的油，于是，在炎热的天气里，它们就会成为森林失火的纵火者。这样，那位老人的话得到了证实。
