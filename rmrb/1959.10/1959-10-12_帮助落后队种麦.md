　　Helping Backward Teams Plant Wheat
    Songcun Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, paid attention to helping backward teams in autumn planting, so that the commune's autumn planting work developed in a balanced manner.
    The commune has a total of eighteen production brigades. At the beginning of the autumn planting season, the four production brigades of Shanhou, Dazetou, Xiaotan, and Nanqiao lagged behind the other production brigades. After discovering this situation, the commune party committee believed that the main reason for the backwardness of these four brigades was that they had suffered varying degrees of flooding this autumn, so some cadres and commune members had developed negative and fearful emotions. In order to help these four teams overcome their fear of difficulties, the commune party committee first analyzed the agricultural production situation this year together with the responsible cadres of the four brigades, so that these four brigades realized that although some crops had suffered from flooding this autumn, the year as a whole was still a harvest year. Through this analysis, the leading cadres of the four brigades had a clear picture in their minds. Next, the commune party committee organized the cadres and commune members of these brigades to visit Songcun Brigade. They saw that the commune members of this brigade were working with great enthusiasm, and the leading cadres were eating and working with the commune members. Songcun Brigade also had difficulties in autumn planting, such as insufficient labor and livestock, but they did not bow to the difficulties. Instead, they relied on the masses and mobilized the masses to overcome the difficulties in every possible way, so the wheat was sown quickly and well.
    With the help of the commune party committee and through on-site visits, the leading cadres of the four brigades, including Dazetou, consciously examined and criticized their right-leaning conservative thinking, and expressed their determination to go all out and lead the masses to catch up with the advanced teams and plant the wheat in a timely and appropriate manner. Cadres at all levels of the brigade went deep into the grassroots to strengthen leadership, and transferred all available labor from all aspects to strengthen the autumn planting front. These four brigades also launched a "seven comparisons" red flag competition movement between teams and between people to compare enthusiasm, attendance, work efficiency, quality, progress, timely sowing, and leading cadres. The labor attendance rate of Dazetou Brigade increased from 80% to 120%, and the two brigades of Nanqiao and Xiaotan increased from the original 85% attendance to 110%. The work efficiency of the lowest also increased by 50% compared with the original, and the more increased by more than one time.
    Due to the above measures, the entire commune had sown 19,000 mu of wheat by September 26, completing 98.5% of the early and mid-season wheat.

　　帮助落后队种麦
    山东文登县宋村公社在秋种中注意帮助落后队，使全社秋种工作平衡发展。
    这个社共十八个生产大队，秋种一开始就有山后、大泽头、硝滩、南桥四个生产大队落后于其他生产大队。公社党委发现这一情况后，认为这四个大队落后的主要原因是由于今年秋季遭受了不同程度的水灾，因此有些干部和社员，产生了消极畏难情绪。为了帮助这四个队克服畏难情绪，公社党委首先同四个大队的负责干部在一起分析了今年的农业生产情况，使这四个大队认识到今秋虽有一部分作物遭受了水灾，但全年来说还是丰收的。通过这一分析，四个大队的领导干部心里有数了。接着，公社党委又组织这些大队的干部和社员参观了宋村大队，看见这个大队的社员冲天干劲，领导干部都和社员同吃、同劳动，宋村大队在秋种中也存在着劳畜力不足的困难，但他们并没有向困难低头，而是依靠群众，发动群众千方百计克服了困难，因而小麦播种得又快又好。
    在公社党委的帮助和通过现场参观，使大泽头等四个大队的领导干部都自觉地检查和批判了右倾保守思想，表示一定要鼓足干劲，带领群众迎头赶上先进队，把小麦适时种足种好。大队的各级干部层层深入，加强领导，并从各方面抽调了一切可以抽调的劳力加强秋种战线。这四个大队又开展了队与队、人与人之间比干劲、比出勤、比工效、比质量、比进度、比适时播种、比干部带头的“七比”红旗竞赛运动。大泽头大队劳动出勤率由80％提高到120％，南桥和硝滩两个大队由原来出勤85％提高到110％。工作效率最低的也比原来提高了50％，多者提高一倍以上。
    由于以上措施，全社到9月26日，已播种小麦一万九千亩，完成了早中茬小麦的98.5％。
