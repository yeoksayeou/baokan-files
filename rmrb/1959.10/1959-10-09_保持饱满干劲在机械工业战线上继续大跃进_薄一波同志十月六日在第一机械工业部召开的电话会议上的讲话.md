Comrades Directors, Deputy Directors, Party Secretaries, and Factory Directors of all bureaus and factories:

Today, the First Ministry of Machine Building is holding a telephone conference for the mechanical industry system. The purpose is to discuss how to better fulfill the production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and strive to complete the annual mechanical production and construction tasks fully ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. It also serves as preparation for a continued Great Leap Forward in production next year, especially for the first quarter of next year. Here, I would like to begin by congratulating you comrades on the great achievements made on the mechanical industry front over the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic, and congratulate you on the new and glorious victories achieved in the continued Great Leap Forward of 1959.

Currently, China's political and economic situation is very good. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and following the victorious path of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, have achieved new and great victories in all aspects of national construction in the continued Great Leap Forward of 1959. In the past nine months of this year, the production situation from January to May has been consistently good, with production increasing month by month. The only shortcoming was that the targets were somewhat high, so although production gradually increased, the plans could not be completed, which somewhat affected the production morale. Between May and June this year, we carried out work to implement the targets, which was absolutely necessary. During the adjustment of targets, it was reasonable for production to decline somewhat, but the decline was excessive. This was because a small gust of Right-leaning cold wind blew in during June and July, and the Right-leaning thoughts existing among a small number of cadres grew, resulting in insufficient enthusiasm and a significant decline in production. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was transmitted and implemented, the Right-leaning thoughts existing in some cadres, some enterprises, and some regions were criticized. This renewed our enthusiasm and quickly launched a new mass campaign to increase production and practice economy, sweeping away the Right-leaning cold wind, and production continued to rise, forming the current extremely favorable situation for production. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee proposed opposing Right-leaning tendencies and boosting enthusiasm, which has once again educated us, making all comrades more deeply aware that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the most important, most valuable, and most powerful weapons in China's socialist construction. All of this provides extremely reliable guarantees for the completion and over-fulfillment of the 1959 national economic plan, and creates extremely favorable conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward in the national economy in the years to come.

Now, a new situation of large-scale mass movements and continuous production increases has emerged on the steel industry front, the coal industry front, and the transportation front. Similarly, on the mechanical industry front, the production situation is also very good. Like other sectors of the national economy, the mechanical industry, although production declined temporarily in June and July during the first three quarters, the overall completion of the plan is still very good. By the end of September, 77% of the total annual output value plan has been completed, an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year. Many products, such as metallurgical equipment, combine harvesters, water pumps, irrigation and drainage machinery, and machine tools, have completed their annual plans three to four months ahead of schedule, calculated by total tonnage, total number of units, or total horsepower. Other products, such as power generation equipment, power machinery, and bearings, have also completed about 80% of their annual production plans. This situation is unprecedented in previous years. Great achievements have also been made in the trial production of new products. Many important new products with advanced levels have been successfully trial-produced, and some have already begun mass production. These include a 650mm blooming mill, a 50,000 kW hydrogen-cooled turbine generator, a 72,500 kW hydroelectric generator, and precision machine tools, as well as many complex new telecommunications, television, broadcasting, and various electrical control equipment used in the Great Hall of the People and other National Day projects, and high-end sedans, etc. Some products even participated in the National Day parade in front of Tiananmen Square. The quality of many old products has also been significantly improved. This shows that new and significant progress has been made in the development of mechanical industry production and the improvement of technical level this year.

The capital construction work of the mechanical industry has completed more than two-thirds of the total annual workload in the first three quarters, which is also better than the completion situation in the same period in previous years.

The mass campaign for increasing production and practicing economy has also been carried out very well in the mechanical industry. Although the time has been short, the broad masses of workers, under the call of the Party, have devoted themselves to the movement with unparalleled enthusiasm. The movement has developed relatively quickly, and its characteristics are speed, momentum, widespreadness, and depth. Many regions and enterprises have adopted forms such as competition between opponents, competition within the same industry, and competition between upstream and downstream processes to launch a hot and lively upsurge of socialist labor emulation. Many enterprise leaders, workers, and technical personnel have combined efforts to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a larger scale, and have organized, planned, summarized, and promoted mass creations. For example, the Shenyang Water Pump Factory organized the effective mass initiatives after testing, arranged them into 357 sets according to the processes, and incorporated them into the process documents, so that the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution were consolidated and developed. The practice of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory is worthy of praise and learning for everyone. We have also gained more experience in leading mass movements and organizing production, so that not only is the movement lively and vigorous, but the measures are also relatively solid. Not only is the output value and output increasing month by month, and the product quality is continuously improving, but also great achievements have been made in saving materials and reducing costs, better achieving an all-round leap forward. For example, the 3,000-ton cargo ship recently manufactured by the Hudong Shipyard has a dock cycle that is two-thirds shorter than the same cargo ship manufactured in the past, taking only nineteen days, and saving a lot of materials and improving the welding quality. The above are just a few examples, and there are many similar situations. In short, this shows that the current situation of the mechanical industry is very good. This is the result of the broad masses of workers resolutely defending and conscientiously implementing the General Line under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. This situation shows that the 1959 plan of the mechanical industry can definitely be completed, and can be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

The current situation is very good, but does this mean that the tasks for the fourth quarter of this year can be completed easily? We cannot say that. If we now begin to be proud of the initial victory, and if we do not consolidate and continue the already high mass movement, please think about what the situation will be like? I think it will be very bad. Comrades, it should be seen that there are still many difficulties in the mechanical industry that need to be overcome. For example, some products within the plan and within the contract have not been completed well, especially some large and heavy products; there are also some difficulties in product matching, material supply, and large-scale processing capacity. These problems must be faced squarely.

In order to complete the fourth quarter and the annual tasks of the mechanical industry better, to provide more and better equipment to various departments of the national economy earlier, and to prepare for a better continued Great Leap Forward in the mechanical industry next year, we should now pay attention to two important issues: One is to complete the tasks within the plan and within the contract well in the fourth quarter of this year, and strive to complete the annual tasks before December 15. One is to prepare conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. Starting from now, we should make good arrangements for next year's work, so that next year's tasks, especially the first quarter's tasks, will be completed better, changing the phenomenon of relaxation at the beginning of the year in the past.

Now, I will talk to you about the following issues:

First, seize all specific measures and strive to increase production under the condition of first ensuring the completion of the tasks within the plan and within the contract. As you know, the products within the plan and within the contract are all urgently needed by the state and are indispensable conditions for various departments of the national economy to realize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960. Therefore, comrades in the mechanical industry departments should regard the completion of these product plans as the most important task. It should be completed not only as an economic task, but also as a political task. The First Ministry of Machine Building requires all regions and enterprises to check the completion of tasks within the plan and within the contract, and strive to complete the annual tasks half a month in advance. I think this is necessary and correct. Many enterprises have already made inspections and taken measures. We should not relax for a moment, and try every possible means to complete and strive to complete ahead of schedule. The comrades in Shanghai put forward the slogan "Do not let the contract pass the New Year." I think this slogan is very good, and all regions should do the same. We should first meet the needs of planned and contracted products, especially key products, in terms of material supply and coordinated cooperation. Under the condition of first completing the tasks within the plan and within the contract, we should spare no effort to increase the production of various products needed by the state and local areas, as long as there are materials and capabilities. Recently, the First Ministry of Machine Building will soon arrange a batch of 1960 production tasks. As long as it does not hinder the completion of this year's planned and contracted tasks, and there are materials and capabilities, we should organize production as much as possible as products increased in 1959.

We must further mobilize the masses, cadres must take the lead in person, and adopt methods such as "three combinations" to try every possible means to overcome some weak links existing in production as soon as possible. For example, in product matching, many regions have solved many problems after adopting methods such as organizing increased production and strengthening regulation. In terms of material supply, on the one hand, we have already asked the raw material departments to vigorously organize increased production and strive to supply them as early as possible, especially the varieties and specifications that are relatively short in steel currently. On the other hand, the mechanical industry departments are also required to vigorously carry out regulation and saving. In the past two months, the mechanical industry has internally regulated more than 200,000 tons of various materials, which shows that the potential for material regulation is great. In terms of strengthening management and practicing strict economy, many regions and enterprises have made great achievements. Other weak links must also rely on the masses, take various measures, strengthen scheduling, organize balance, and promote the style of cooperation in every possible way to overcome them. In order to achieve this, leading comrades at all levels should do their work more deeply and meticulously, constantly conduct inspections, find out the key problems, and think of solutions with the broad masses of workers. Comrades, in all these measures, his soul is still the mass line, and cadres take the lead in participating in labor. "Thousands of strategies and hundreds of plans, the mass line is the first plan," "Thousands of articles and ten thousand items, cadres taking the lead in participating in labor is the first item."

In the capital construction work of the mechanical industry, we should also actively take various measures to strive to complete this year's plan more, faster, better, and more economically, so that each project can be completed and put into production as early as possible.

Second, continue to carry out mass movements on a large scale and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution.

Currently, the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy has been carried out more widely and deeply in the mechanical industry, but there are still a few units that have not carried out it enough, and there are also unbalanced and incompletely consolidated phenomena in the places that have already been carried out. Therefore, units that are still relatively backward must catch up; places where the climax of the mass movement has not been consolidated must strengthen all aspects of work to consolidate and continue it. We must mobilize all the broad masses of workers and consolidate and continue the movement. To fully mobilize the masses, the most crucial issue is that cadres participate in labor, conscientiously strengthen political leadership, continue to criticize the Right-leaning thoughts that still remain in some cadres, and do a good job in meticulous organizational work. In carrying out mass movements, we must further implement the idea of an all-round leap forward, not only striving to increase output, but also continuing to improve product quality, and practicing strict economy in all aspects to further reduce product costs. Therefore, every enterprise and every workshop should have indicators for an all-round leap forward, and should have measures for an all-round leap forward.

The Great Leap Forward must not only rely on hard work and solid work, but also rely on skillful work. Therefore, we must more vigorously organize the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. All the difficult problems in production should be handed over to the masses to discuss, study, think of solutions, and strengthen organizational leadership. The various technical creations of the masses should be organized for careful testing, summarization, and promotion. In this work, we must organize management cadres, technicians, and workers well, and adopt the method of "three combinations."

The field for technical innovation and technical revolution in the mechanical industry is very broad. Not only should some temporary difficulties in production be solved through mass technical innovation and technical revolution, but also many long-term topics in the development of production technology, and the mastery of the production technology of many new products must also mobilize the masses and give full play to collective wisdom to solve, rather than relying only on a few experts (relying on experts is completely necessary, and experts have the responsibility of experts, but do not "rely only on a few people"). Countless examples in the Great Leap Forward have fully proved that this is a broad road for developing technology more, faster, better, and more economically. Therefore, we must persist in carrying out mass technical innovation and technical revolution as a long-term and important task, and continuously develop and improve it.

When the masses have high enthusiasm for production, plus the tasks are relatively tight, the leaders of various regions and enterprises must also pay attention to safe production, combine work and rest, and must do a good job in the lives of the masses.

Third, while striving to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, we must create conditions for a better continued Great Leap Forward in the mechanical industry in 1960. In order to welcome a better Great Leap Forward next year, and to make a good start in the first quarter of next year, preventing the possible slack mood at the beginning of the year, we should make all necessary production and technical preparations in the fourth quarter. The First Ministry of Machine Building can arrange the first batch of production tasks for next year soon, which creates a very good condition for everyone to prepare for next year's work.

In order to overfulfill this year's production tasks, we must take effective measures to consolidate and continue the current upsurge of mass movement. This requires a lot of work. I will now put forward four points for the leaders of various regions and factories to pay attention to: (1) We must continue to strengthen political work, implement political command, and keep the masses always full of enthusiasm; (2) We must continue to improve enterprise management, so that production and safety are combined, work and rest are combined, and political mobilization and material incentives are combined, etc.; (3) Ensure the timely supply of raw materials and materials; (4) Arrange production tasks in a timely manner, especially the production for the first quarter of next year, etc.

    保持饱满干劲在机械工业战线上继续大跃进
    薄一波同志十月六日在第一机械工业部召开的电话会议上的讲话各位厅局长、各厂的党委书记和厂长同志们：
    今天，第一机械工业部召开机械工业系统的电话会议，目的是讨论如何更好地完成今年第四季度的生产任务和争取提前十天到十五天全面完成今年机械生产和建设的任务，并且准备好明年生产的继续大跃进，首先是明年第一季度的生产，在这里，我首先祝贺建国十年来同志们在机械工业战线上取得的巨大成就，祝贺同志们在1959年的继续大跃进中取得的新的辉煌胜利。
    当前，我国的政治、经济形势都很好。全国人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，沿着1958年大跃进的胜利道路，在1959年的继续大跃进中，在国家建设事业的各方面都取得了新的巨大的胜利。在今年已经过去的九个月里，一至五月份的生产情况一直是良好的，生产是逐月上升的，缺点只是指标偏高了些，虽然生产逐步上升，却完不成计划，多少影响了些生产情绪；今年五、六月间我们进行了指标落实工作，这是完全必要的，在调整指标的时候，生产下降一些也是合理的，但下降的多了些，这是由于在六、七月间，吹来了一小股右倾冷风，少数干部中存在着的右倾思想滋长起来，干劲不足，生产显著下降；在党的八届八中全会决议传达并贯彻执行以后，批判了部分干部、部分企业和部分地区所存在的右倾思想，又重新鼓足了干劲，很快地又掀起了一个新的群众性的增产节约运动的高潮，横扫了右倾冷风，生产不断上升，形成目前对生产极为有利的形势。八届八中全会提出的反右倾、鼓干劲，又一次地教育了我们，他使全体同志更加深刻地认识了总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国社会主义建设事业中最重要、最宝贵也是最有力的武器。所有这一切都为完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划提供了极为可靠的保证；并且为今后的年代里国民经济继续大跃进创造了极为有利的条件。
    现在，在钢铁工业战线上、煤炭工业战线上、运输战线上都出现了大搞群众运动、生产不断上升的新形势。同样，在机械工业战线上，生产的形势也同样是很好的。机械工业和国民经济的其它部门一样，在前三个季度中，虽然六、七月间生产曾经一度下降，但是总的完成计划的情况还是很好的。到九月底止，全年总产值计划已经完成了77％，比去年同期增长一倍还多。许多产品，例如冶金设备、联合收割机、水泵、排灌机械、机床等，按照总吨位、总台数或总马力数计算，已经提前三个月到四个月完成了全年计划；其他产品如发电设备、动力机械、轴承等产品也完成了全年产量计划的80％左右。这种情况是历年来所没有过的。在试制新产品方面，也已经取得了巨大的成绩。许多重要的、具有先进水平的新产品已经试制成功，有的并且已经开始成批生产，其中有650毫米的初轧机、5万瓩的氢冷却汽轮发电机、72500瓩水轮发电机和精密机床，有人民大会堂及其他国庆工程上使用的许多复杂的新式电讯、电视、广播、各种电器控制设备等产品，有高级小轿车等等。有的产品还参加了庆祝建国十周年天安门前的检阅。许多老产品在质量上也有了显著提高。这说明今年机械工业生产的发展和技术水平的提高上又取得了新的、巨大的进展。
    机械工业的基本建设工作，前三个季度已经完成了全年工作量的三分之二以上，也比往年同一时期完成的情况好。
    群众性的增产节约运动，在机械工业中也开展得很好。虽然时间不长，但是广大职工群众在党的号召下，都以无比的热情投入了运动。运动开展得比较迅速，它的特征是很快，来势汹涌，很普遍、很深入，许多地区和企业采取对手竞赛、同行业竞赛、上下工种一条龙竞赛等等形式，开展了热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛的热潮。许多企业的领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”，更大规模地开展了技术革新和技术革命，并且有组织、有计划地总结和推广了群众的创造。例如沈阳水泵厂把经过试验行之有效的群众倡议，按工序整理成三百五十七套，纳入工艺文件，使技术革新和技术革命的成果得到了巩固和发展。沈阳水泵厂的做法是值得表扬的，也是值得大家学习的。我们在领导群众运动和组织生产上也有了更多的经验，因而不但运动的局面轰轰烈烈，在措施上也比较扎实。不但产值、产量月月上升，产品质量不断提高，在节约材料、降低成本方面也有很大成绩，更好地作到了全面跃进。例如沪东造船厂最近制造的三千吨货轮，船台周期比过去制造的同样货轮缩短了三分之二的时间，只用了十九天，并且节约了许多材料和提高了焊接质量。以上只不过举几个例子，类似情况还很多。总之，这说明当前机械工业的形势很好。这是广大职工在党和毛主席的英明领导下，坚决保卫和认真贯彻执行总路线的结果。这一形势说明，机械工业1959年的计划是一定能够完成的，而且可以提前和超额完成。
    目前形势很好，但这是不是说今年第四季度的任务可以轻而易举地完成呢？不能这样说。如果我们现在就为初步的胜利而开始骄傲，如果不把已经高涨的群众运动巩固地持续下去，请大家想一想，情况会是怎样呢？我想会是很不好的。同志们，应该看到现在机械工业中还存在着不少的困难，需要我们去克服。例如有些计划内、合同内的产品完成得不够好，特别是其中的一些大型、重型产品完成得不够好；产品配套、材料供应和大型加工能力等方面也还有些困难。这些问题都必须予以正视。
    为了使机械工业第四季度和全年任务完成得更好，给国民经济各部门更早地提供更多、更好的设备，并且为明年机械工业更好地继续大跃进作好准备，我们现在要注意两个重要的问题：一个是在今年第四季度要把计划内、合同内的任务很好地完成，力争在十二月十五日以前完成全年的任务。一个是要为明年的继续大跃进准备条件，从现在开始，就要很好地部署明年的工作，使明年的任务首先是明年一季度任务完成得更好，改变过去年初松劲的现象。
    现在，我和大家再谈谈以下几个问题：
    第一，抓紧一切具体措施，在首先保证完成计划内任务和合同内任务的条件下，力争增产。大家知道，计划内、合同内的产品都是国家迫切需要的产品，是国民经济各部门为实现1960年继续大跃进所不可缺少的条件。因此，机械工业部门的同志们应该把完成这些产品的计划作为最重要的任务。不但是当作经济任务，而且也当作政治任务来完成。第一机械工业部要求各地区、各企业对计划内、合同内的任务完成情况进行检查，并且力争提前半个月完成今年任务，我认为这样做是必要的，也是正确的。现在许多企业已经作了检查，并且采取了措施。我们应该不放松一时一刻的时间，千方百计地去完成和力争提前完成。上海市的同志提出“不让合同过年”的口号，我看这个口号提得很好，各地区都应该这样做。应该在材料供应、配套协作等方面，首先满足计划内、合同内特别是其中的重点产品的需要。在首先完成计划内、合同内任务的条件下，行有余力，只要有材料、有能力，就应该千方百计地努力增产国家和地方需要的各种产品。最近，第一机械工业部即将把1960年的生产任务先布置一批，只要不妨碍今年计划内、合同内的任务的完成，又有材料和能力，就应该尽可能地组织生产，作为1959年增产的产品。
    我们必须进一步发动群众，干部必须亲自带头，采取“三结合”等方式，千方百计，争取尽快地克服生产中存在着的一些薄弱环节。例如产品配套，许多地区采取了组织增产、加强调剂等办法以后，解决了不少问题。在材料供应上，一方面我们已经要求原材料部门大力组织增产，力争及早供应，特别是目前钢材中比较短缺的品种、规格。另一方面也要求机械工业部门大力进行调剂和节约。近两个月来机械工业内部已经调剂了各种材料二十多万吨，这说明材料调剂的潜力是很大的。在加强管理、厉行节约方面，许多地区和企业都做出了很大成绩。其他方面的薄弱环节也必须依靠群众，采取各种措施，加强调度、组织平衡，大兴协作之风，千方百计地加以克服。为了作到这一点，各级领导同志应该把工作做得更深入、更细致，不断地进行检查，摸清关键性的问题，和广大职工群众一起想办法。同志们，在这一切措施中间，他的灵魂还是走群众路线，干部带头参加劳动，“千计百计，走群众路线第一计”，“千条万条，干部带头参加劳动第一条”。
    在机械工业的基本建设工作中，也应该积极地采取各种措施，力争更加多快好省地完成今年的计划，使各个工程项目及早地完成并且投入生产。
    第二，继续大搞群众运动，大力开展技术革新和技术革命。
    目前，群众性的增产节约运动在机械工业中已经比较普遍的深入的开展着，但是还有少数单位开展得不够，已经开展起来的也存在着不平衡不完全巩固的现象。因此，还较落后的单位，必须迎头赶上；群众运动高潮还没有巩固的地方，一定要加强各方面的工作，使之巩固和持续下去。一定要把所有的职工群众发动起来，并且把运动巩固和持续下去。要充分发动群众，最关键的问题就是干部参加劳动，认真地加强政治领导，继续批判一部分干部中还残存着的右倾思想，并且作好细致的组织工作。在开展群众运动中，要进一步贯彻全面跃进的思想，不但要力争提高产量，还要继续提高产品质量，并且从各方面厉行节约，进一步降低产品成本。因此，每一个企业，每一个车间都应该有全面跃进的指标，都应该有全面跃进的措施。
    大跃进不但要依靠苦干、实干，还必须依靠巧干。因此，必须更加有力地组织群众进行技术革新和技术革命。所有生产中的困难问题，应该交给群众去讨论、研究、想办法，并且加强组织领导，对群众的各项技术创造应该组织认真地试验、总结和推广。在这项工作中，一定要把管理干部、技术人员和工人群众很好地组织起来，采取“三结合”的办法进行。
    机械工业中进行技术革新和技术革命的园地是非常广阔的。不但生产中存在的一些临时性的困难，要通过群众性的技术革新和技术革命去解决，在生产技术发展中的许多带有长远意义的课题，许多新产品的生产技术的掌握，也必须发动群众，充分发挥集体的智慧去解决，而不能只依靠少数专家去解决（依靠专家是完全必要的，专家有专家的责任，但不要“只依靠少数人”）。大跃进中的无数事例，充分证明这是多快好省地发展技术的一条康庄大道。因此，我们就必须把开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命作为长期的重要任务坚持下去，并不断地发展提高。
    在群众生产热情很高的情况下，加上任务又比较紧，各地区、各企业的领导还必须注意安全生产，劳逸结合，必须搞好群众的生活。
    第三，在力争提前和超额完成今年计划的同时，要为1960年机械工业更好地继续大跃进创造条件。为了迎接明年更好的大跃进，使明年第一季度旗开得胜，防止年初可能出现松劲情绪，第四季度应该作好各种必要的生产技术准备。第一机械工业部最近就可以把明年第一批生产任务布置下去，这就为大家作好明年的准备工作创造了一个很好的条件。
    为了超额完成今年的生产任务，就必须采取有效措施，把目前已经掀起的群众运动高潮巩固和持续下去。这就要做很多工作，我现在提出四点，请各地区、各厂领导同志注意：（一）必须继续加强政治工作，实行政治挂帅，使群众经常保持饱满的干劲；（二）必须继续改善企业管理工作，使生产和安全结合，劳逸结合，政治鼓动和物质鼓励结合等；（三）保证原料和材料的及时供应；（四）及时布置生产任务，首先是明年第一季度的生产，等等。
