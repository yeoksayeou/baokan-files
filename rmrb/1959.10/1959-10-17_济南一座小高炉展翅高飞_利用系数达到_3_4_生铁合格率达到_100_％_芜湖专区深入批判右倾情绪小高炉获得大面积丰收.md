　　Jinan’s Small Blast Furnace Takes Off
　　Utilization Coefficient Reaches 3.4, Pig Iron Qualification Rate Reaches 100%
　　Wuhu Region Deeply Criticizes Right-Leaning Sentiments, Small Blast Furnaces Achieve Large-Scale Harvest
　　(Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th) Who says small blast furnaces cannot produce good iron? Who says small blast furnace iron smelting is "not worth the effort"? The outstanding achievements of many small blast furnaces in Shandong Province, especially the three-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, which achieved high yield, high quality, low consumption, and stable production, provide strong evidence. Since August 7th, this small blast furnace has not only been producing normally, but its output has also been increasing linearly. In early September, the daily output of pig iron was 4.643 tons, in mid-September 8.61 tons, and in late September 9.582 tons. Entering October, it reached a new level. By the 9th, the daily output of pig iron was 10.33 tons, the utilization coefficient was as high as 3.4, the pig iron qualification rate was 100%, the coke consumption per ton of iron smelted was 730 kg, and the unit cost was 201 yuan and 25 fen, which was 18 yuan and 75 fen lower than the state-stipulated ex-factory price per ton of iron.
　　The Shandong Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to the new record created by the factory's smelting workshop. On the morning of October 10th, Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, inspected the entire production process of this small blast furnace, listened to the reports of Liu Xuegong, Secretary of the factory's Party General Branch, Wang Fenglin, Deputy Secretary, Zhang Xiaoqin, Secretary of the Smelting Workshop Branch, and others, and had cordial conversations with the furnace workers. The responsible cadres of the factory reported to Comrade Shu Tong that the reason why this small blast furnace has created such outstanding achievements in the past month or so is the result of conscientiously implementing the Party's instructions to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage vigorous efforts.
　　After listening to the report, Comrade Shu Tong praised this small blast furnace, saying that it is the best red flag on the metallurgical front in Shandong Province. He called on all blast furnaces in the province to learn from this small blast furnace. He said that the entire staff and workers of the smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory are not only models of vigorous efforts and striving for excellence, but also models of learning from advanced experiences and surpassing advanced experiences; they are not only models of daring to think and daring to act and technological innovation, but also models of business management.
　　The comrades from the industrial departments of the Provincial Party Committee who accompanied Comrade Shu Tong to inspect the factory calculated together with the cadres of the factory that if the current more than 500 small blast furnaces in Shandong Province that have been put into production all reach this level, they can produce 3,000 tons of pig iron more for the country every day, and save more than 30 million yuan for the whole year. Therefore, Comrade Shu Tong praised them as models for implementing the Party's general line with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
　　Comrade Shu Tong's speech gave great encouragement to all the staff and workers in the factory's smelting workshop. They are determined to stride forward at a flying speed and march towards a utilization coefficient of 4.5!

　　(Our newspaper, Hefei, 16th) The small blast furnace production in Wuhu Region, Anhui Province, has achieved a large-scale harvest of high yield, high quality, and low consumption. On the basis of overfulfilling various plans in the third quarter, from October 1st to 13th, the average utilization coefficient of the eight-cubic-meter to twenty-eight-cubic-meter small blast furnaces put into production in the entire region increased to 1.448, and the coke ratio decreased to 1.1 tons. The qualification rate of pig iron reached 95% in September.
　　The achievement of this success is due to the large-scale mass movement and the continuous opposition to right-leaning tendencies and the encouragement of vigorous efforts. When the average utilization coefficient of the small blast furnaces in the entire region reached one, some cadres developed the idea of ​​being satisfied with the status quo, believing that "small blast furnaces can reach this level, which is about the same" and "there are no more ideas to think about in terms of utilization coefficient." In response to this situation, the Wuhu Municipal Party Committee took various measures to criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking among some cadres. Methods such as teaching, learning, checking, and comparing were used to educate cadres and workers. "Teaching" means grasping high-yield blast furnaces with the same conditions for education; "calculating" means starting from finding the gap between high-yield furnaces and low-yield furnaces to conduct detailed calculations. The use of these methods greatly improved the ideological understanding of cadres and workers. Through a mass competition movement in which you chased me and I chased you, the production level of small blast furnaces was rapidly improved, and many small blast furnaces reached the peak of high quality and high yield. Now, there are thirty-seven small blast furnaces in the entire region with a utilization coefficient of more than 1.7, of which twelve have reached more than 2, and the highest has reached 2.194.

　　济南一座小高炉展翅高飞
    利用系数达到3.4　生铁合格率达到100％
    芜湖专区深入批判右倾情绪小高炉获得大面积丰收
    本报济南16日电　谁说小高炉不能炼出好铁？谁说小高炉炼铁“得不偿失”？担负生铁重要生产任务的山东省许许多多的小高炉尤其是济南印染厂冶炼车间的三立方米小高炉创造的高产、优质、低耗、稳定生产的优异成绩，提供了强有力的证据。这座小高炉8月7日以来，不仅生产正常，而且产量是直线上升。9月上旬日产生铁四点六四三吨，中旬八点六一吨，下旬九点五八二吨。进入10月份更上一层楼，到9日日产生铁十点三三吨，利用系数高达三点四，生铁合格率为100％，每炼一吨铁的耗焦量为七百三十公斤，单位成本二百零一元二角五分，比国家规定的每吨铁出厂价格还低十八元七角五分。
    中共山东省委非常重视这个工厂冶炼车间创造的新纪录。省委第一书记舒同同志在10日上午视察了这座小高炉的全部生产过程，听取了工厂党总支书记刘学功、副书记王凤林、冶炼车间支部书记张孝钦等的汇报，并和炉前工人进行了亲切的交谈。这个厂的负责干部向舒同同志汇报说，这座小高炉所以能在最近一个多月以来创造如此优异的成绩，是认真贯彻党的反右倾、鼓干劲指示的结果。
    舒同同志在听取汇报后，赞扬了这座小高炉，说这是山东全省冶金战线上最好的一面红旗。他号召全省所有高炉向这座小高炉学习。他说，济南印染厂冶炼车间的全体职工，既是鼓干劲、争上游的模范，又是学先进、超先进的模范；既是敢想敢干、技术革新的模范，又是经营管理上的模范。
    随同舒同同志一起到该厂视察的省委工业部门同志和这个厂的干部一起算了一笔账，假如目前山东全省已投入生产的五百多个小高炉都达到这样水平，每天就可以多为国家生产三千吨生铁；全年就可节省三千多万元。因此，舒同同志赞扬他们又是多快好省执行党的总路线的模范。
    舒同同志的讲话，给予这个厂冶炼车间全体职工极大的鼓舞，他们决心以飞跃的速度阔步前进，向利用系数四点五进军！

    本报合肥16日电　安徽省芜湖专区小高炉生产获得了高产、优质、低消耗的大面积丰收。在三季度超额完成了各项计划的基础上，10月1日至13日，全专区投入生产的八立方米至二十八立方米的小高炉，平均利用系数提高到一点四四八，焦比降低到一点一吨。生铁的合格率在9月份便达到了95％。
    这一成就的取得是由于大搞群众运动，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。当全专区的小高炉利用系数平均达到一的时候，在部分的干部中就产生了满足现状的思想，认为“小高炉能达到这个水平就差不多了”和“在利用系数上没有点子可想了”。针对这一情况，中共芜湖市委采取了各种办法批判了部分干部中的右倾保守思想。采用教、学、查比等办法，向干部和职工进行教育。“教”就是抓住条件相同，产量高的高炉进行教育；“算”就是从找高产炉和低产炉的差距入手，进行算细账。采用这些方法，大大提高了干部职工的思想认识，通过群众性的你追我赶的竞赛运动，使小高炉的生产水平迅速的提高，许多小高炉都登上了优质高产的高峰。现在，全专区利用系数在一点七以上的小高炉有三十七座，其中达到二以上的有十二座，最高的达到了二点一九四。（附图片）
