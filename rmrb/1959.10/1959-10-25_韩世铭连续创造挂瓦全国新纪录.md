Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 24th: Han Shiming, the leader of the No. 501 Production Team of the Xuzhou Construction Engineering Company, has continuously set new national records for tile hanging three times since last year. The production team he leads has overfulfilled its production tasks month after month and year after year since 1954. During the great leap forward in August and September this year, they overfulfilled their leap forward plan by more than double.

In recent years, Han Shiming has successfully innovated more than 100 advanced operating methods and tools of significant value, increasing production efficiency by several or even dozens of times. In March of this year, during the construction of the Xuzhou Boiler Factory's workshop, he hung 1,060 square meters of tiles with both hands in two hours, breaking the national record of 850 square meters he set last year. However, Han Shiming was not satisfied with his existing achievements because he had not yet achieved the guaranteed target of 1,400 square meters he had proposed to the Party. With the help of Party Branch Secretary Zhou Chunsheng, he identified the redundant movements in tile hanging and the lack of hanging lines as factors affecting further improvements in efficiency. From then on, he got up early every day to practice running and doing exercises to increase his physical strength. After more than a month of diligent study and hard practice, his tile hanging movements made greater progress. On April 17th, he hung 1,636 square meters of tiles in two hours, averaging more than 200 tiles per minute, setting a new national tile hanging record for the third time.

Han Shiming is not only a tile hanging expert, but also has a high bricklaying efficiency, which is more than seven times higher than the quota. At the same time, he has also mastered more than ten technologies such as carpentry, stonework, and plumbing.

    韩世铭连续创造挂瓦全国新纪录
    新华社南京24日电　徐州市建筑工程公司五○一生产队队长韩世铭，从去年以来连续三次创造挂瓦全国新纪录。他领导的生产队从1954年以来年年月月超额完成生产任务，在今年大战8、9月中，他们又超额一倍以上完成了跃进计划。
    几年来，韩世铭革新成功了一百多种具有重大价值的先进操作方法和工具，生产效率都是几倍、几十倍的提高。今年3月间，他在徐州锅厂厂房的施工过程中，两小时内双手挂瓦一千零六十平方米，突破了去年他自己创造的八百五十平方米的全国最高纪录。但韩世铭并不满足自己已有的成绩，因为还没有实现向党提出的一千四百平方米的保证指标。在党支书周春生的帮助下，他找出了挂瓦多余动作和挂线少这两个影响进一步提高效率的原因。从此他每天一早就起身练习跑步做操，增强体力。经过一个多月的勤学苦练，他的挂瓦动作有了更大的进步。4月17日，他两小时内挂瓦一千六百三十六平方米，平均每分钟挂瓦二百多块，第三次创造了全国挂瓦最高纪录。
    韩世铭不仅是一个挂瓦能手，砌砖效率也很高，比定额提高七倍多。同时他还掌握了木工、石工、水工等十多种技术。
