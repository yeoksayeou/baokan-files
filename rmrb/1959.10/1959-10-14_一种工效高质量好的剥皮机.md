To utilize pigskins for leather production, leather industry workers have created many new machines and accumulated new experiences.

During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, Zhang Deyuan, a slaughterhouse worker in Chengdu, Sichuan, created an electric pigskinning machine. Its skinning efficiency is thirty times higher than manual labor. One machine can skin 1,500 pigskins in eight hours. This skinning machine can peel the whole skin or just a portion of the pigskin's core. The peeled pigskin is free of fat and meat, with good quality. The machine's structure is not complex. Except for a few high-speed transmission wheels, the other transmission parts operate at low speed. Therefore, the frame and handle can be made of wood, allowing even small and medium-sized cities to manufacture it. This creates extremely favorable conditions for the mass skinning of pigskins everywhere.

　　一种工效高质量好的剥皮机
    为了利用猪皮制革，皮革工业职工们曾经创造了不少新的机器和新的经验。
    1958年的大跃进中，四川成都市屠宰工人张德元创造的电动剥猪皮机，剥皮效率比手工提高三十倍，一台机器八小时可剥一千五百张猪皮。这种剥皮机可以剥全皮，也可以单剥猪皮的皮心一部分，剥下的猪皮不带油肉，质量良好。这种机器结构也不复杂，除了几个传动轮转速较高外，其他传动部分都是在低速下运行，因而机架和把手等都可以用木材做，中小城市也能制造。这就为各地大量开剥猪皮创造了极为有利的条件。
