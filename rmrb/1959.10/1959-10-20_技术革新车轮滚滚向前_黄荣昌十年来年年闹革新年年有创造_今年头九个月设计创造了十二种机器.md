Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th. Huang Rongchang, an old technical innovation expert from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company with a background as a carpenter who has been holding high the red flag and marching forward for ten years, has recently been selected as an advanced producer representative to attend the National "Conference of Heroes."

Huang Rongchang designed and created eight machines in the third quarter of this year. Adding the four machines created in the first half of this year, the total is twelve. Calculating only five of these, including the large riverside double-arm crane, the blast furnace hoisting machine, the large double-arm gantry magnet crane, and the large automatic tipping slag remover, the annual savings can reach more than 1.55 million labor days.

Saving more manpower and material resources for the country, and solving major key problems in production in the fastest possible time, this is the remarkable characteristic of Huang Rongchang and his dozens of comrades in the mechanization workshop in technical innovation over the years. Since the proposal of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, Huang Rongchang has been carefully observing the key problems in production everywhere, and carefully calculating everywhere. The fifteen large-scale automatic transportation equipment he successfully created since the Great Leap Forward last year have all met the requirements of being both suitable and economical.

After the Zhongshan Hall converter plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company adopted a large amount of indigenous iron smelting, the slag in front of the furnace often piled up like a mountain. Every time a furnace layer was dismantled and replaced, the factory had to mobilize a large number of people to clear the slag. Each slag removal would delay production for more than ten hours. Moreover, operating next to the slag pile with scorching heat and flying slag ash was very harmful to health. Seeing this situation, Huang Rongchang decided to reform the slag removal method. After thinking day and night, he finally designed a machine that could automatically transport and dump slag, based on the principle of the converter slewing arm charging machine he had successfully created not long ago. With the help of the workers, after ten days of hard work, a large automatic tipping slag remover was put into production on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The successful creation of the slag remover greatly shortened non-production time. Originally, it took twelve to twenty-four hours to remove a furnace of slag; with the slag remover, it only takes a maximum of eight hours. At the same time, it can save more than 27,500 labor days per year, saving more than 48,000 yuan in value.

In the third quarter of this year, Huang Rongchang encountered such a thing: every time he went to the converter plant, he always heard the amplifier shouting for the blast furnace to send molten iron quickly. One day, he went to the blast furnace and saw a machine moving as slowly as a tortoise feeding materials, unable to meet the needs of the blast furnace. Someone told him that because the blast furnace could not supply the molten iron for the converter smelting, it had delayed production for more than 2,000 minutes in a month. Huang Rongchang also learned from the company's technical department that the company had decided to adopt the blast furnace inclined bridge charging hopper, which is also commonly used abroad. A budget was made, and the company was prepared to order a machine worth 35,000 yuan from the outside. He calculated, no way! Although this machine is good, it's like fetching water from afar to put out a fire. Ordering from the outside would take at least three or four months before delivery; during installation, some of the blast furnace equipment would have to be dismantled and reassembled, which would affect production. Therefore, it was not cost-effective in terms of time or money. Therefore, he proposed to the Party committee to rely on his own efforts and volunteered to undertake this task. After receiving the support of the leadership, he quickly found his old comrades Tang Liangneng, Zhang Shicun and others to study together. They proposed to make the created machine not only play the role of the inclined bridge charging hopper, but also be fast, good, and economical. They held many "Zhuge Liang meetings" and finally designed a large and clever machine, and it only took eighteen days to manufacture the machine. The workers named this machine the simple vertical lifting feeder. After it was put into production, it immediately changed the material feeding situation of the blast furnace, increasing efficiency by more than double, and the material was evenly distributed, without damaging the furnace lining, reducing the caking phenomenon of the furnace, and also benefiting the extension of the furnace life. Because this machine was used instead of the inclined bridge charging hopper, it saved the country more than 110,000 yuan.

In the ranks of advanced producers in Chongqing, Huang Rongchang has been holding high the red flag and taking the lead in marching forward for ten years. Before liberation, he was an ordinary carpenter who didn't even know his own name; after liberation, under the education and cultivation of the Party, he developed the excellent qualities of the working class of daring to create, not being afraid of difficulties, working hard, and learning modestly. In the past ten years, he has not only learned eleven techniques such as turning, fitting, planing, and milling, but also personally designed and manufactured seventy-one machines that play a major role in production.

　　技术革新车轮滚滚向前
    黄荣昌十年来年年闹革新年年有创造
    今年头九个月设计创造了十二种机器
    新华社重庆19日电　十年来一直高举红旗大踏步前进的老技术革新能手、重庆钢铁公司木工出身的机械工程师黄荣昌，最近已被推选为出席全国“群英大会”的先进生产者代表。
    黄荣昌在今年第三季度自己设计创造了八种机器，加上今年上半年创造的四种机器，共计十二种。仅以其中大型江边双臂起重机、化铁炉提升机、大型双臂龙门磁铁起重机和大型自动翻斗出渣机等五种计算，全年就可以节省一百五十五万多个劳动日。
    为国家节约更多的人力物力，以最快的时间解决生产上的重大关键问题，这是黄荣昌和他的机械化车间的几十名战友，多年以来在技术革新中的显著特色。党的社会主义建设总路线提出以后，黄荣昌更是处处留心观察生产中的要害问题，处处精打细算。他在去年大跃进以来创造成功的十五部大型自动运输设备，都达到了既适用又经济的要求。
    重庆钢铁公司中山堂转炉厂大量采用土铁炼钢以后，炉前的渣子经常堆积如山，拆换每层炉子，厂里都要动员大批人力清除渣子，每清除一次渣子，要耽误十几小时的生产，而且在热气炙人、渣灰乱飞的渣子堆边操作，对身体健康也很有影响。黄荣昌见到这种情形，决心改革清渣方法，经过日思夜想，终于根据他不久前创造成功的转炉旋臂加料机的原理，设计一种既能自动运输又能翻倾渣子的机器。在工人们的帮助下，经过十天的苦战，一部大型自动翻斗除渣机在建国十周年的那一天投入生产了。除渣机的创制成功，大大缩短了非生产时间。原来要用十二小时到二十四小时才能出完一炉的渣子；采用除渣机以后，最多只要八小时。同时，每年可以节约二万七千五百多个劳动日，节约价值在四万八千元以上。
    今年第三季度，黄荣昌遇到这样一件事情：每走到转炉厂，总听见扩大器在喊化铁炉快送铁水。一天，他去化铁炉一看，只见一个像乌龟爬行一样慢的机器在那里进料，不能适应化铁炉的需要。有人告诉他，由于化铁炉供应不上转炉吹炼的铁水，在一个月里就耽误了两千多分钟的生产时间。黄荣昌又在公司技术部门了解到，公司已决定采用一般在国外也常用的化铁炉斜桥料盅，造好预算，准备在外面订制一部价值三万五千元的机器。他一算，不行！这种机器虽然好，但是远水救不得近火，向外面订货至少也得再等三、四个月才能交货；安装时，还要把化铁炉的一些设备拆掉重新装过，会影响生产。因此，无论时间上、资金上都很不合算。于是，他向党委提出要自力更生，并且自告奋勇地承担这项任务，得到领导上支持以后，他赶紧找老战友唐良能、张石村等人共同研究，提出要使创造的机器既能起到斜桥料盅的作用，又要多快好省，他们开了多少次“诸葛亮会”，终于设计出一种大型灵巧的机器，而且仅用十八天的时间就把机器制造出来了，工人们将这部机器命名为简易直升进料机。它投入生产以后，即刻改变了化铁炉的进料状况，效率比原来提高一倍以上，而且布料均匀，不打坏炉膛，减少了炉子结瘤现象，对延长炉子寿命也很有好处。由于没有采用斜桥料盅而采用了这种机器，便为国家节省了十一万多元。
    在重庆市的先进生产者行列中，黄荣昌十年来一直高举红旗，带头迈步前进。解放以前，他是一位连自己名字也不认识的普通木工；解放以后，在党的教育培养下，发扬了大胆创造，不怕困难，刻苦钻研，虚心学习的工人阶级的优良品质。十年来，他不仅学会了车、钳、刨、铣等十一种技术，而且亲手设计和制造出了七十一部在生产上起重大作用的机器。
