Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: At the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 20th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetzov, delivered a lengthy speech, sharply exposing the conspiracy of the international reactionaries, led by US imperialism, to force the UN General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Tibet problem." He declared that the Soviet delegation firmly opposes discussion of the so-called "Tibet problem" in the United Nations and will vote against the slanderous proposal put forward by the Irish and Malayan delegations.

Kuznetzov said that placing the so-called "Tibet problem" on the agenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, and an illegal step that violates one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. Kuznetzov said that we, like many other delegations, are willing to study truly important issues aimed at consolidating peace and developing international cooperation, rather than discussing non-existent problems that poison the international atmosphere and damage the prestige of the United Nations.

Kuznetzov emphasized that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and any attempt by imperialist groups to separate Tibet from the People's Republic of China is doomed to failure. It is strange that the representatives of precisely those countries are playing the role of conductors, countries that are known as the inspirers of the most reactionary systems and the main supporters of the disintegrating colonial system.

Kuznetzov exposed the hypocritical attempts to accuse China of "destroying Tibet's religious and cultural autonomy." He pointed out that these baseless and ridiculous accusations come from the vicious and absurd slanders of Tibetan reactionaries, fabricated by the initiators who are clamoring about the "Tibet problem."

Kuznetzov said, why are some people once again urging the General Assembly to violate the United Nations Charter and use the General Assembly to incite hostility and hatred towards the great Chinese people? He said that we are fighting here against the stupid practice of trying to return the United Nations to the dark days of the "Cold War." The masterminds who raised the "Tibet problem" want to obstruct the recent positive and constructive efforts taken to improve international relations. The masterminds who put the "Tibet problem" on the agenda are those groups who are not interested in easing international tensions and stopping the arms race. The Irish and Malayan delegations are merely playing the role of expressing the will of these groups, playing clowns in a farce directed by those who are keen to exacerbate international tensions.

Kuznetzov continued, the aggressive groups also created this conspiracy in an attempt to undermine cooperation between the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries, and to weaken the unity of the people of Asian and African countries in their struggle to consolidate national independence and lasting peace.

Kuznetzov said that in recent years, certain imperialist groups have been trying every possible means to intensify tensions in Asia and the Far East; to expand the war activities and sabotage activities of aggressive groups, and even extend such activities to neutral countries; to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Indochina, etc. The following facts can also prove this point: Although the Chinese People's Volunteers have long since completely withdrawn from North Korea, American troops still remain in South Korea, Taiwan and other Chinese islands are still occupied, and are used to carry out aggression against the Chinese people and maintain tension in the Far East. The South Vietnamese authorities, under foreign instigation, have refused to implement the decision of the Geneva Conference regarding elections in North and South Vietnam. South Vietnam and Laos, Taiwan and South Korea are all being used to create threats to the peace and security of Asian countries.

Kuznetzov emphasized that the newly launched vicious attacks on the People's China will never affect the Chinese people's march towards socialist victory, nor can they stop the continued enhancement of the international prestige of the People's Republic of China.

    库兹?佐夫在联大痛斥干涉中国内政的阴谋
    不容殖民卫士?造“西藏问题”
    不许回到“冷战”的黑暗时期去
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫，20日在联合国大会全体会议上作了长篇发言，尖锐地揭露了以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派强使联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”的阴谋，并且声明苏联代表团坚决反对在联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”，并将投票反对爱尔兰和马来亚代表团提出的诽谤中国的提案。
    库兹?佐夫说，把所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程是粗暴干涉中华人民共和国内政的企图，是破坏联合国宪章基本原则之一的非法步骤。库兹?佐夫说，我们像其他许多代表团一样，愿意研究目的在于巩固和平和发展国际合作的真正重要的问题，而不是去讨论那些毒化国际气氛和损害联合国威望的根本不存在的问题。
    库兹?佐夫着重指出，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，帝国主义集团使西藏脱离中华人民共和国的任何企图注定要失败的。奇怪的是，正是这样一些国家的代表扮演指挥者的角色，这些国家是作为最反动的制度的鼓舞者和分崩离析的殖民体系的主要支持者而闻名的。
    库兹?佐夫揭穿了指责中国“破坏西藏宗教和文化自治”的伪善的企图。他指出，这些毫无根据的令人发笑的指责来自西藏反动分子的恶毒而荒谬的诽谤，是叫喊“西藏问题”的发起者?造出来的。
    库兹?佐夫说，为什么有人再一次促使大会破坏联合国宪章和利用大会来煽动敌视和仇恨伟大的中国人民呢？他说，我们在这里正在同想使联合国回到“冷战”黑暗时期的愚蠢作法进行斗争，提出“西藏问题”的主谋者想阻挠最近为了改善国际关系所采取的一些积极的建设性的努力。把“西藏问题”列入会议议程的主谋者就是那些对缓和国际紧张局势和停止军备竞赛不感兴趣的那些集团。爱尔兰和马来亚代表团只是扮演这些集团的意志的表达者，在热中于加剧国际紧张局势的人导演的一出丑剧中扮演丑角。
    库兹?佐夫继续说，侵略集团所以要制造这种阴谋，还由于企图打击中华人民共和国同其他亚洲国家之间的合作，削弱亚非国家人民在他们争取巩固民族独立和持久和平斗争中的团结。
    库兹?佐夫说，近年来，某些帝国主义集团一直在千方百计地加剧亚洲和远东地区的紧张局势；扩大侵略集团的战争活动和破坏活动，甚至把这种活动扩展到中立国家；阻挠关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的实现等等。就是下面这样的事实也可以证明这点：虽然中国人民志愿军早就全部撤出了北朝鲜，而美国军队至今还留在南朝鲜、台湾和中国其他岛屿仍然被占领着，并被用来对中国人民进行侵略活动和保持远东的紧张局势。南越当局在外来的唆使下拒绝履行日内瓦会议关于在北越和南越进行选举的决定。南越和老挝、台湾和南朝鲜都被用来制造对亚洲国家和平和安全的威胁。
    库兹?佐夫着重指出，新发起的对人民中国的凶恶的攻击绝不会影响中国人民向社会主义胜利迈进，也不能阻挡中华人民共和国国际威望的继续增强。
