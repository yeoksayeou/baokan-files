Xinhua News Agency, October 8th dispatch from Cairo: As the People's Republic of China celebrated its tenth anniversary, newspapers in the United Arab Republic launched a fierce campaign to defame the new China. UAR officials even boycotted the National Day receptions held by the Chinese Embassy in Cairo and the Consulate General in Damascus.

The excuse used by the UAR side to launch this anti-China campaign was that the Chinese Communist Party invited Comrade Baghdadsh, General Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party Central Committee, to attend the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and that he spoke at the meeting.

This time, many UAR newspapers and news agencies mobilized together, using a large amount of space and the most vicious language to slander the new China. The stock-in-trade of these newspapers in slandering China is fabricating rumors, because they cannot produce any facts to prove their accusations against the new China. The Cairo "Al-Ahram" fabricated a rumor on October 3rd, saying that "the Chinese government prohibited the delivery of the telegram from the UAR Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Chargé d'affaires in China," and that the Chinese authorities "conducted internal and external surveillance" of the UAR embassy. This newspaper also claimed on the 4th, without any basis, that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the UAR Ambassador to fly back to Beijing "to report the situation to the government." "Al-Ahram" and other newspapers also made threatening noises, saying that the UAR government would recall the UAR Chargé d'affaires in China, close the Chinese Consulate General in Damascus, and shut down the UAR people's group promoting UAR-China friendship (prior to this, the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association had already been closed). Although government leaders from Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, and Morocco attended the National Day receptions held by the Chinese embassies in those countries, this newspaper insisted that all Arab capitals "boycotted" the celebrations at the Chinese embassies. "Al-Ahram" also fabricated a rumor on October 3rd, saying that China was the "mastermind" of the Mosul "terrorist massacre," and that "China plays a leading role in directing the Iraqi Communist Party."

The Cairo "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial on October 1st written by Sela Salem, director of the Liberation Publishing House. This editorial also fabricated some rumors to incite discord between China and its neighboring countries, saying that China was "concentrating troops on the Indian border, intimidating India" and "blatantly carrying out armed aggression," and that China was "launching battles" on the Burmese border. Salem wrote another editorial for "Al-Gomhouria" on the 3rd, even more viciously saying that China had "continuously carried out aggression against certain Eastern and Western countries" in the past two years and "rudely interfered in the internal affairs of other countries."

    造谣诬蔑　挑拨离间
    阿联报刊发动反华运动
    阿联官员竟抵制我使馆国庆招待会
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联合共和国的报刊在中华人民共和国庆祝建国十周年的时候发动了一个猛烈的诽谤新中国的运动。阿联官员竟然抵制中国驻开罗大使馆和驻大马士革总领事馆举行的国庆招待会。
    阿联方面发动这次反华运动的借口，是中国共产党邀请了叙利亚共产党中央委员会总书记巴格达什同志参加中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝大会和他在会上讲了话。
    这次，阿联的许多报刊和通讯社一齐动员，用大量篇幅和最恶毒的语言来诽谤新中国。这些报刊诽谤中国的看家本领就是捏造谣言，因为它们拿不出任何事实来论证它们对新中国的指责。开罗“金字塔报”10月3日造谣说“中国政府禁止把阿联外交部的电报交给驻中国的代办”，中国当局对阿联使馆“进行内外监视”。这家报纸4日还毫无根据地说中国外交部要求驻阿联大使飞返北京“向政府提出形势报告”。“金字塔报”等还虚声恫吓地说，阿联政府要召回阿联驻中国代办、封闭中国驻大马士革总领事馆和阿联人民促进阿联和中国友好的团体（在此以前，叙中友好协会已被封闭）。尽管伊拉克、也门、苏丹和摩洛哥等国政府领导人都出席了中国驻这些国家的使馆所举行的国庆招待会，这家报纸却硬说什么阿拉伯各国首都都“抵制”中国使馆的庆祝活动。“金字塔报”3日还造谣说中国是摩苏尔“恐怖屠杀”的“策划者”，它说什么“中国在指挥伊拉克共产党方面起着领导作用”。
    开罗“共和国报”10月1日发表了解放出版社社长赛拉·萨勒姆所写的社论。这篇社论也造了一些谣言来挑拨中国同邻国的关系，说中国在印度边境“结集军队，恐吓印度”和“明目张胆地进行武装侵略”，说中国在缅甸边境上“发动战斗”。萨勒姆在3日又为“共和国报”写了另一篇社论，更加恶毒地说中国在过去两年内“对某些东方和西方国家不断进行侵略”和“粗暴地干预其它国家的内政”。
