Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 7th: In the first five days of October, Tianjin's steel production leaped to a new level. The average daily output from October 1st to 5th reached 1,856 tons, an increase of 318 tons compared to the average daily output in September, the month with the highest production. The qualification rate of steel ingots on October 5th increased by 3.07% compared to the previous month.

    Encouraged by the slogan "Go all out in Red October, surpass September in October," the average hourly output of each steelmaking team at Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant in the first five days of October reached 10.87 tons, an increase of 26% compared to the average hourly output in the third quarter. Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant launched a "Five-Day Red Short-Distance Competition." The Yang Desheng Youth Steelmaking Team and the Zhuo Yuncheng Pig Iron Furnace Team cooperated closely to ensure a sufficient supply of molten iron, producing fifteen heats of steel in one day, exceeding the plan by six heats. The First Branch of this plant achieved an average daily output of more than 700 tons from October 1st to 5th, an average daily increase of more than 150 tons of steel compared to the same period in September.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 6th: Coal miners in Liaoning Province achieved a great victory in the first battle of October. From the 1st to the 5th, the average daily completion of the production plan was 111%, increasing the national coal production by more than 14,400 tons per day. Among them, Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, the four major state-owned coal mines, all exceeded the state production plan every day. On October 1st and 2nd, the vertical and inclined shafts of the Fuxin Mining Bureau overhauled machinery and equipment, and the three open-pit coal mines completed the overall coal production task. By the 3rd, all the mining machinery and equipment of the bureau were put into production, exceeding the plan by more than 6,900 tons of coal that day.

    Since the beginning of October, leading cadres of many coal mines in Liaoning have been on the front line of production, working with the workers to seize high yields and high quality. Some mines have also organized comfort groups to arrange amateur cultural and recreational activities for the workers. At present, coal miners in Liaoning Province are advancing victoriously, determined to achieve daily red in October and a completely red month.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 7th: The Zhongliangshan Coal Mine organized workers to surpass the end of the month at the beginning of the month and for the night shift to catch up with the day shift, so that the average daily output of raw coal in the first five days of October greatly exceeded the end of September. In the first five days of October, the average daily output of the entire mine increased by 13.3% compared with the average daily output in the last five days of September, and 31.2% compared with the average daily output in the first five days of September.

    At the beginning of October, the leadership of the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine firmly grasped high production at the beginning of the month, tightening up every day, every shift, and every moment, changing the past situation where the output at the beginning of the month was lower than at the end of the previous month, and the output of the night shift was lower than the day shift. Leading cadres at all levels of the entire mine went down to the mine shafts in shifts, working with the workers on-site to solve key problems in production in a timely manner. In order to solve the key problem of transportation not keeping up, the mine's leading cadres, together with workers and technicians, studied and promptly changed the original shunt transportation to circular transportation, eliminating the phenomenon of empty cars waiting for loaded cars, and doubling transportation efficiency. Subsequently, one-ton mine cars were changed to three-ton mine cars, and the track gauge was changed from 600mm to 900mm, increasing transportation efficiency by two times. With the strengthening of the transportation link, coal mining volume increased significantly at the beginning of October.

    In order to ensure that every shift is tightened and every shift achieves high production, the mine's leading cadres paid special attention to grasping the night shift, which had the lowest output among the three shifts each day. Each night shift had a responsible cadre from the mine or shaft level on duty to direct production, and at the same time, workers were mobilized to carry out a competition for the night shift to catch up with the day shift. Therefore, the night shift production situation has improved significantly compared to the past. The output of the South Mine Shaft of this mine during the night shifts in the first five days of October increased by 25.5% compared to the night shift output in the last five days of September.

    天津各钢厂　辽宁四煤矿　中梁山煤矿
    十月开门红天天大增产
    新华社天津7日电　10月份头五天，天津市的钢产量跃进到了一个新的水平。1日至5日的平均日产量达到一千八百五十六吨，比产量最高的9月份平均日产量增长三百一十八吨；10月5日的钢锭合格率比上月提高了3.07％。
    在“大干红10月，10月超9月”的口号鼓舞下，天津第一钢厂各个炼钢小组，10月份头五天的平均小时产量达到十点八七吨，比第三季度的平均小时产量提高了26％。天津第二钢厂开展了“五日红短距离竞赛”，杨德生青年炼钢小组和化铁炉卓云成小组密切配合，作到了铁水充分供应，一天就炼出十五炉钢，比计划多生产了六炉钢。这个厂的第一分厂，1日至5日的平均日产量达到七百多吨，和9月份同期比较，每天平均多产一百五十多吨钢。
    新华社沈阳6日电　辽宁省煤矿职工10月首战大捷。从1日到5日，平均每天完成生产计划111％，每天为国家增产煤炭一万四千四百多吨。其中抚顺、阜新、本溪和北票四大国营煤矿，矿矿天天都超额完成国家生产计划。10月1日和2日，阜新矿务局的竖井、斜井都检修机器设备，三个露天煤矿便完成了全局的煤炭生产任务；到3日，全局的矿井机械设备都投入生产，这天比计划超产了六千九百多吨煤。
    进入10月以来，辽宁许多煤矿的领导干部都亲临生产第一线，同职工一道夺高产，夺优质；有的矿还组织了慰问组，给工人安排好业余的文化娱乐活动。目前，辽宁省煤矿职工正在乘胜猛进，决心作到10月日日红、全月满堂红。
    新华社重庆7日电　中梁山煤矿组织职工月初超月底、夜班赶白班，使10月份头五天的原煤平均日产量大大超过了9月底。10月份头五天，全矿平均日产量比9月份后五天平均日产量增长了13.3％，比9月份头五天平均日产量增长了31.2％。
    10月份一开始，中梁山煤矿领导方面就狠狠地抓月初高产，天天抓紧，班班抓紧，时时抓紧，改变过去月初产量比上月底低、夜班产量比白班低的状况。全矿各级领导干部都下矿井轮流值班，到现场同职工群众一起，及时解决生产中的关键问题。为了解决运输跟不上的关键问题，矿的领导干部同工人、技术人员一起研究，及时把原来的岔道运输改为循环运输，消除了空车等重车的现象，使运输效率提高一倍；接着，又把一吨矿车改为三吨矿车，把运输轨道由六百轨距改为九百轨距，使运输效率提高了两倍。随着运输环节的加强，10月初采煤量便显著提高了。
    为了保证班班抓紧、班班高产，这个矿的领导干部特别注意抓每天三班中产量最低的夜班。每个夜班都有矿或井一级的负责干部值班指挥生产，同时发动职工群众开展夜班赶白班的竞赛。因此，夜班生产情况比过去有了显著好转。这个矿南矿井10月份头五天夜班的产量，就比9月份后五天的夜班产量提高了25.5％。（附图片）
