Bring Back Every Last Sweet Potato
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Frost has fallen, and now is the crucial period for harvesting sweet potatoes. This year, thanks to the people's communes in various regions exerting their utmost efforts and striving for excellence, overcoming severe natural disasters, sweet potatoes have grown better than in any previous year. How to mobilize the vast number of commune members to harvest and store the abundant sweet potatoes well has become a major event on the agricultural production front.

This year, harvesting and storing sweet potatoes well has even more favorable conditions: under the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, a new upsurge in agricultural production has been formed; the labor organization and production responsibility system of the people's communes are more sound; the broad masses of commune members and cadres have a deeper understanding of the losses caused by the rough autumn harvest last year and the benefits of careful harvesting this year; and the tools for harvesting, digging, transporting, and slicing sweet potatoes are more abundant than in the past. As long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized, this year's sweet potatoes can definitely be harvested and stored well. However, some people just don't see these advantages, but only see that sweet potatoes have high moisture content, are afraid of frost, not resistant to storage, and difficult to transport, emphasizing that "it is impossible to harvest all the sweet potatoes in a very short time without any losses."

It is true that sweet potatoes have high moisture content, are afraid of frost, not resistant to storage, and difficult to transport. However, as long as we think of more ways, losses can still be avoided. There is evidence for this. The Xicao Village Production Team of the Dongchangshou People's Commune in Xinle County, Hebei Province, has created a record of storing sweet potatoes in cellars that do not rot for twenty years. This is because they have taken various corresponding measures according to the characteristics of sweet potatoes themselves. For example, sweet potatoes have high moisture content and are not resistant to frost, so people seize the time to dig them out as much as possible before "Frost's Descent"; even if they cannot be dug out before "Frost's Descent," they try their best to run ahead of the severe frost, harvest them in time, and prevent the sweet potatoes from being frozen. Sweet potatoes have high moisture content, thin skin, are easily broken, and not resistant to storage, so they are particularly careful when harvesting and digging sweet potatoes, so as not to cause the sweet potatoes to be dug, scratched, or bumped, and not to break the potato tubers; when loading and transporting, they handle them gently, load them gently, transport them gently, and place them gently; when storing them, they pick out the ones that have broken skin, diseased potato tubers, insect-eaten ones, and potato tubers exposed to the ground, and do not put potato tubers stained with wet mud, soaked in water and rain, or exposed to wind and frost into the cellar, and also make sure to put them into the cellar on the same day they are harvested to avoid the dug-out sweet potatoes from getting cold and freezing. Especially for seed potatoes, they must not only be harvested in time, but also be kept by special personnel.

It can be seen from this that whether losses can be avoided depends on our thinking and work. If we are not intimidated by difficulties such as high moisture content and fear of frost, but instead boost our morale and overcome difficulties, "it is up to man to conquer nature," we will definitely be able to harvest and store sweet potatoes well. On the contrary, if we think that losses are inevitable and do not make subjective efforts, then losses will really be inevitable.

At present, many places are paying attention to solving the problem of slicing tools while harvesting sweet potatoes intensively. According to statistics from four provinces and cities, Hunan, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, more than 33,000 sweet potato slicers and shredders have been manufactured and promoted by mid-September; Sichuan and Hunan have vigorously repaired and modified existing slicers and shredders to give full play to their role, which is good. The role of manual slicing and shredding tools should not be ignored either, and they must be fully utilized. A sweet potato grater can grate more than 500 jin of slices a day, and such tools can be said to be available in every household in concentrated sweet potato producing areas, and the potential is great. In the work of slicing and drying sweet potatoes, it is also necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs," not only to grasp the large-scale slicing tools with high efficiency, but also not to relax the small-scale manual slicing tools, and to mobilize all available slicing tools to go all out. In areas where there is no habit of slicing and drying in the past, publicity and demonstration work should also be done well to explain to the masses the importance of slicing and drying for harvesting well, storing well, and giving full play to the utilization value of sweet potatoes. The canteens of the people's communes should also try their best to study various ways of eating sweet potato slices, and truly achieve meticulous processing of coarse grains, so that they will never get tired of eating them.

When harvesting sweet potatoes, we should also pay attention to harvesting all parts of the sweet potatoes. The whole sweet potato is a treasure. The potato tubers are grain, feed, and industrial raw materials, the vines can be used as feed, and the "拐子" (the connection part between the potato vines and the potato tubers) can be used to make wine. These useful things should not be discarded in the fields as waste.

Time is pressing and fleeting. It is hoped that the Party committees at all levels will seize the opportunity, lead the masses to boost their morale, harvest and store sweet potatoes well, win the final battle of this year's autumn harvest, and make agricultural production a complete victory!

    把甘薯一块不丢地收回来
    本报评论员
    霜降已过，目前正是收获甘薯的紧张时期。今年由于各地人民公社鼓足干劲，力争上游，战胜了严重的自然灾害，甘薯长得比以往任何一年都要好。如何动员广大社员把丰产的甘薯收好、藏好，这已成为当前农业生产战线上的一件大事。
    今年收好、藏好甘薯，有着更为有利的条件：在反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的伟大号召下，新的农业生产高潮已经形成；人民公社的劳动组织和生产责任制更加健全；去年秋收粗糙带来的损失和今年细致收打的好处，广大社员和干部已体会得更加深刻；今年甘薯收、刨、运输、切片工具都比过去充裕等等。只要充分利用这些有利条件，就一定可以把今年的甘薯收好、藏好。但是，有些人恰恰看不到这些，而只看到甘薯水分多、怕霜冻、不耐贮存、不好运输等等，强调“要在很短的时间里把甘薯全部收回，不遭损失是办不到的。”
    甘薯的确是水分多、怕霜冻、不耐贮存、不好运输。但是，只要多想办法，损失还是可以避免的。这有事实为证。河北新乐县东长寿人民公社西曹村生产队就创造了二十年不烂窖的贮存甘薯的成绩。这是因为他们根据甘薯本身的特点，采取了各项相应的措施。比如甘薯水分多、不耐霜冻，人们就抓紧时间在“霜降”前尽量把它刨完；即使不能在霜降前刨完，也想尽办法跑在严霜的前面，及时收完，防止甘薯受冻。甘薯水分多、皮薄易破、不耐贮存，他们在收刨甘薯的时候就特别仔细，不使甘薯受到刨伤、擦伤、撞伤，不折断薯块；在装运的时候做到轻拿、轻装、轻运、轻放；在贮藏的时候，把已经破皮的、病薯块、虫蚀的和露出地面的薯块都挑出，沾有湿泥的、水泡雨淋的、受过风霜的薯块也不入窖，而且做到当天收获当天入窖，以免刨出的甘薯受冷受冻。特别是对于种薯，不仅要及时收回，而且要有专人保管。
    由此可见，损失能不能避免，决定于我们的思想和工作。如果我们不为水分大、怕霜冻等困难所吓倒，而是鼓足干劲战胜困难，
  “事在人为”，就一定能够把甘薯收好、藏好。相反，如果我们认为损失是难免的，不作主观努力，那损失就真是难免的了。
    目前已有不少地方在紧张收获甘薯的同时，注意解决切片工具的问题。据湖南、安徽、北京、上海四个省、市统计，到9月中旬已制造推广薯类切丝、切片机三万三千多部；四川、湖南大力修理改装现有切片、切丝工具，使其充分发挥作用，这是好的。对于手工切片、切丝工具的作用，也不可忽视，必须充分利用起来。一个刨薯的擦板一天可以擦片五百斤以上，这样的工具在薯类集中产区可以说是家家都有，潜力很大。在甘薯切片晒干工作上，也要认真贯彻两条腿走路的方针，既要抓效率高的大型切片工具，又不能放松小型的手工切片工具，要动员一切可以利用的切片工具，全力以赴。在过去没有切片晒干习惯的地区，还要作好宣传、示范工作，向群众说明切片晒干对于收好，贮好，充分发挥甘薯利用价值的重要意义。人民公社的食堂也要千方百计钻研薯干的多种食用方法，真正作到粗粮细作，百吃不厌。
    在收获甘薯的时候，还要注意把甘薯的各部分都收获回来。甘薯混身都是宝，薯块是粮食、饲料和工业原料，蔓叶可以作饲料，“拐子”（薯藤和薯块的连接部分）可以酿酒。这些有用的东西，不能当做废物抛弃在地里。
    时机紧迫，稍纵即逝，希望各级党委紧紧把握时机，领导群众鼓足干劲，收好、藏好甘薯，打胜今年秋收的最后一仗，使农业生产获得全胜！（附图片）
