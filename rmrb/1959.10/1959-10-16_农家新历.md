　　New Farmer's Almanac
　　By our staff reporter Wang Huandou
　　Before dawn on the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan, if you listen carefully on the silent highway, the roaring torrents from Dujiangyan, coupled with the rhythmic hum...hum... of the hydropower stations, sound like a train starting up in the impenetrable morning mist across from you... Just as you're engrossed in listening, the rising sun shoots out its rays, and then the emerald green rice paddies, newly built residential areas, and the people working in the fields are displayed with exceptional clarity. This is no ordinary train; this is a train speeding towards a happy life, racing swiftly on the broad road of collectivization...

　　Entering the Twelfth Management District of the Hongguang Commune in Pixian County, passing through a bamboo forest to the left of the Seventh Public Canteen, we arrived at Qiu Erniang's home. Her family currently has nine members. Before the establishment of the commune, these nine people were originally two households: Qiu Erniang and her husband, second son, and youngest daughter were one household; the eldest son, daughter-in-law, and their three children were another. After the commune was established, the two households became one family again. From this change in the family, one can see the subtle influence that the people's commune is already having on the depths of people's lives.

　　Six years ago, the eldest son, Qiu Licong, got married. His wife, Li Shuhua, was determined to escape the complicated household chores and participate in the work and labor of the agricultural cooperative, insisting on separating the family. Unexpectedly, she gave birth to three children in a few years. Those young women who had elderly people at home to take care of household affairs happily went to the fields to produce, while she herself had to stay at home to take care of the babies. She once hoped that the family would reunite. Qiu Erniang sympathized with her daughter-in-law, but the old lady was then the production team leader and was also afraid of getting involved in housework and leaving the field labor. With the establishment of the commune, the dining hall took care of meals and the nursery took care of the children, so these old problems were solved, and the family reunited.

　　The day we visited her home, just as we walked into the bamboo forest next to the house, we heard a chorus of clucking. Stepping into the gate, lo and behold! Several women of Qiu Erniang's family were laughing non-stop in the yard catching chickens. Eight or nine roosters and hens were crowing and flying, stirring up dust all over the yard.

　　"The menfolk have been harvesting and planting day and night, busy for months. I want to kill a chicken to nourish them—besides, this is the first year of our people's commune, and we've had such a great harvest, we should celebrate it well," Qiu Erniang said with a squinting smile, welcoming us. Although she had lost a few teeth, her spirits were extraordinarily high.

　　Now that the chicken had been caught and sent to the kitchen, Qiu Erniang smiled again and told us about the origin of eating chicken. It turned out that Qiu Erniang had raised nine chickens. When they had just jumped out of their shells, Qiu Erniang said to her husband, sons, and daughter-in-law, "Whoever works actively and becomes a model worker, I will kill a chicken for them when they grow up!" Later, the eldest son, Qiu Licong, who worked at the bee farm, managed the newly established business entrusted to him by the commune very well. He not only harvested tens of thousands of pounds of honey, but also planned to increase the existing two thousand or so swarms of bees several times by the end of this year. The commune members praised his tireless work enthusiasm and his spirit of hard study and drilling, and elected him as the vice-chairman of the Hongguang Commune. A few days ago, Qiu Erniang heard that he was going to put bees in the field for honey production, so she caught a big rooster to kill, but hesitated for a long time, unwilling to do it. "Let's sell it first to support the city, and kill that rooster with the flowery tail when he comes back." The old lady fried a plate of eggs for her son as a farewell gift. Then, the second son, Qiu Liyang, who was a tractor driver in the commune, was named the head of an advanced machine; the daughter-in-law, Li Shuhua, was named a "Five-Good Cook"; the old man, Qiu Bingzhang, was no simpleton either. He was over sixty years old this year, and the commune had long asked him to retire at home, but he disregarded everyone's advice and participated in the construction of the residential area. In the past two months, he also supported the rush harvesting and planting. Needless to say, if you were to bring this old man of advanced age to compare, he would also meet Qiu Erniang's conditions for killing a chicken. This made the old lady embarrassed; one "debt" was not repaid, and new "debts" were added one after another. She never expected that so many active workers would appear in their family within a year of the establishment of the commune. Now, "we can't delay any longer." When the commune decided to take a day off, Qiu Erniang decided to fulfill her promise.

　　Just as we were talking with great interest, Li Shuhua walked out of the kitchen. She had already cooked the chicken in the pot and was carrying a bottle to buy condiments. Qiu Erniang took out fifty cents and asked her to take it with her. Li Shuhua smiled and patted her pocket, indicating that she had money with her. The old lady sighed to herself: the current women are different from those of the older generation. Everyone has their own salary, and they can take out money to buy whatever they want. Qiu Erniang's family of five adults earns a total of about thirty-eight yuan a month in wages, excluding meals. On the day the salary is issued each month, Qiu Erniang talks about the previous month's expenses and the next month's spending plan. After everyone puts together the daily expenses, the vast majority of the remaining salary is controlled by themselves. In order to make it easier to keep track of work hours, the second son, Qiu Liyang, wanted to buy a watch, so everyone enthusiastically pooled money to help him. Since the establishment of the commune, every member of the family, young and old, has added at least two pieces of clothing and many daily necessities. Among them, some things are given to each other as gifts: the eldest son bought a cloth shirt for his father, the daughter-in-law often paid to buy cigarettes for her mother-in-law, and the mother-in-law also made new clothes for her grandchildren... Qiu Erniang said: "In the past, even if you had this kind of heart to care for your relatives, it would be a vain dream without money."

　　A rush of footsteps came from far to near, and the youngest daughter, wearing a red scarf, pulled her second brother, Qiu Liyang, home to eat chicken. Qiu Liyang was wearing a work uniform full of grease stains, and he was carrying a bottle of wine that he had just bought for his parents. As soon as he came back, he was busy washing his hands and face, and changed into the clothes that Qiu Erniang had washed clean and ironed. The old lady squinted her eyes and looked at her neatly dressed son for a long time: "To this day, the mother hasn't even seen your girlfriend yet!" Qiu Liyang said repeatedly, "No, there really isn't!" and quickly ran into the kitchen to help with the cooking. Qiu Erniang told us that she had entrusted someone in the cooperative management area to find a pretty good girl for her son. She was twenty years old this year, had gone to elementary school, and was better than the young men when it came to working. The old lady had spent a lot of effort to invite the girl to her home as a guest, wanting to show her to her son. But Qiu Liyang refused to come back no matter what. A shrewd and strong girl was unwilling to wait long, and the old lady couldn't keep her no matter how hard she tried, so she had to send the girl back. But she firmly believed that when the girl passed by the edge of the field Qiu Liyang was working on, her son would be moved when he saw her. Unexpectedly, Qiu Liyang just greeted her indifferently and casually, jumped on the machine, twisted the "steering wheel" with both hands, and the tractor turned its rear end and ran away. Qiu Erniang went home angrily, only to be blamed by her old husband: "I told you a long time ago to mind your own business. Today is a new era, why are you still doing things according to the old almanac, trying to arrange your children's marriage?" Qiu Erniang was very unhappy about this matter. Later, a young man who was on good terms with Qiu Liyang secretly said to her: "Aunt Qiu, you don't have to worry too much, your daughter-in-law is probably..." As he said this, he made a gesture of manipulating the steering wheel. The old lady suddenly understood.

　　The work in the kitchen was already finished, and Li Shuhua and Qiu Liyang were sitting in the yard chatting with us. The old man was also called back by his young grandson. Qiu Erniang said to everyone: "The chicken has been killed, and the promise that was made has finally been fulfilled."

　　"What promise?" someone asked.

　　"Have you forgotten? That day when these chickens were just hatched..."

　　"If that's the case, we wouldn't dare to eat Mom's chicken. Who can do better than Mom!" Li Shuhua said with a smile. She was telling the truth. The old lady had not been idle for a single day since last autumn. At night, she was a welfare committee member, busy leading everyone to rectify the canteen and nursery; during the day, she was the director of the Respect for the Elderly Home in the management area, taking care of lonely old people and leading them to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens, striving for self-sufficiency; late at night, she often went to the public canteen to take night shifts for Li Shuhua. Therefore, on the night Li Shuhua was named a "Five-Good Cook," she said passionately to people: "This is all because I have a good mother-in-law, and she is also our good leader!"

　　农家新历
　　本报记者　王焕斗
    黎明以前的川西平原，在寂静的公路上侧耳细听，来自都江堰的咆哮的激流，加上一个个水力站有节奏的轰?轰?的声音，就像列车在那对面不见人的晨雾中开动……。正当你听得入神，初升的太阳射出了光芒，这时，碧绿的稻田、新修建的居民点以及在田间劳动的人群，便格外清晰地展示出来。这不是普通的列车，这是奔向幸福生活的火车，在公社化的大道上飞快地奔驰着……
    进入郫县红光公社第十二管理区，穿过第七公共食堂左边的一片竹林，我们到了丘二娘家里。她家现有九口人。这九口人在公社成立以前本来是两户：丘二娘夫妇和二儿子、小女儿是一户；大儿子、儿媳妇和他们的三个小孩又是一户。公社成立以后两户又合成一家了。从家庭这种变化中，可以看出人民公社已经在人们的生活深处发生着的微妙影响。
    六年前，大儿子丘立崇结婚了，媳妇李淑华一心要摆脱繁杂的家务事情，去参加农业社的工作和劳动，闹着分了家。不料她在几年之内一连生了三个娃娃，那些家里有老人照料家事的青年妇女，都欢欢乐乐地下田生产，而她自己却只好闷在家里抱娃娃。她曾希望一家人重新合居。丘二娘对于媳妇是同情的，但是老太太当时担任生产队长，同样也害怕沾上家务、脱离了田间劳动。公社一建立，吃饭有食堂，娃娃有托儿所，这些老问题都解决了，于是一家人又合在一起了。
    我们到她家访问那天，刚走进宅旁的竹林，就听见一片咯咯咯咯的鸡叫声。跨进大门一看，嗬！丘二娘一家几个妇女正笑个不住地在院子里捉鸡，八、九只公鸡和母鸡叫着飞着，闹得满院里尘土飞扬。
    “他们爷儿几个连宵带夜又收又种，整整忙了几个月啦，我要杀只鸡给他们补补身子——再说，我们人民公社成立的头一年，就得到了这么大的丰收，也应当好好庆贺一下。”丘二娘眯笑着接待了我们。她虽然掉了几个牙齿，精神却异常饱满。
    现在，鸡捉到手里，送到厨房去了，丘二娘又笑着和我们讲起一段吃鸡的来历。原来，丘二娘喂了九只鸡，在它们刚刚从蛋壳里跳出来的时候，丘二娘就向老伴、儿子和媳妇说：“你们谁的工作积极，谁当了模范，等鸡长大了，我就给谁杀一只！”后来，在养蜂场工作的大儿子丘立崇，把公社交给自己领导的这项新办的事业经营得十分出色，不仅收了成万斤蜂蜜，而且要在今年年底以前使现有的两千多群蜂子增加几倍。社员们都称赞他那种不倦的工作热情和苦学苦钻的精神，并且把他选拔为红光公社的副社长。前些日子，丘二娘听说他要到外地放蜂制蜜了，便捉了一只大公鸡要杀，可犹豫了半天没舍得下手。“还是先卖了支援城市吧，等他回来再杀那只花尾巴的公鸡。”老太太给儿子炒了一盘鸡蛋饯行。接着，在本社当拖拉机手的二儿子丘立扬被评为先进机车的车长；儿媳妇李淑华被评为“五好炊事员”；老头子丘秉章也不简单，今年六十多岁了，社里老早就叫他在家休养，可他不顾大家的劝阻，参加了修建居民点的工作，近两个月他又支援抢收、抢种。不用说，要把这大年纪的老头子找来评比一下，他也够上了丘二娘杀一只鸡的条件。这可叫老太太为难了，一笔“债”没有还，接二连三地又添了新“债”。她绝没想到，公社成立不到一年，她们家里会出现这么多积极工作的人物。现在，“不能再拖了”，当社里决定放假一天的时候，丘二娘决定实现自己的诺言。
    正谈得津津有味，李淑华从厨房走出，她已经把鸡煮在锅里，提着瓶子去买调料。丘二娘掏出五角钱叫她带去，李淑华笑着拍拍衣袋，表示身边有钱。老太太感叹地自言自语地说：现在的妇女可跟老一辈的景况不同了，每个人都有自己的工资，买什么东西伸手就掏出钱来。丘二娘家五个大人，每月伙食除外，工资共收入三十八元左右。每月发工资那天，由丘二娘讲讲上月的开销和下月的开支计划，大家凑出日用开支后，余下的绝大部分工资都由自己支配。二儿子丘立扬为了便于掌握工作时间想要买一只表，大家就热情地凑钱帮助他。自从公社建立以来，全家大小每人至少添了两件衣裳和不少日用品。其中，有些东西是互相赠送的：大儿子给父亲买过布衫，媳妇经常出钱给婆婆买烟，婆婆也给孙儿缝制新衣……。丘二娘说：“过去，就是有这份体贴亲人的心肠，没有钱也是空想。”
    一阵急迫的脚步声由远而近，系着红领巾的小女儿拉着她二哥丘立扬回家吃鸡来了。丘立扬穿着一身满是油垢的工作服，手上提着刚刚给爸爸妈妈打的一瓶酒。他一回来就忙着洗手洗脸，换上丘二娘给洗净、压平的衣裳。老太太眯起眼睛把收拾得干净整齐的儿子望了半天：“到今天，当妈妈的还没看见过你的对象呢！”丘立扬一边连说：“没得，硬是没得！”连忙拔脚躲进厨房帮炊去了。丘二娘给我们说，她曾经托人在合作管理区给儿子物色到一个漂漂亮亮的好姑娘，今年二十岁，上过小学，干起活来连小伙子都比不赢她。老太太费了很大心机才把那姑娘请到家里作客，想叫儿子看看她。偏偏丘立扬说什么也不回来。一个精明要强的姑娘哪肯久等，老太太再三挽留不住，只好送姑娘回去。但她深信，当姑娘从丘立扬耕作的田边路过时，儿子看了一定会心动。没想到，丘立扬只是不冷不热、一般化地招呼了几句，就跳上机车，两只手一扭“圆盘盘”，拖拉机掉过屁股就跑了。丘二娘生着气回到家里，又遭到老伴的埋怨：“我早就劝你少管闲事，今天是新时代了，你怎么还按照老皇历办事，想包办儿女的亲事？”丘二娘为了这件事闹了个满心不痛快。后来，跟丘立扬相好的一个小伙子悄悄对她说：“丘大婶，你不用多操心，你的儿媳妇恐怕是……”说着，两手比了个操纵方向盘的架式。老太太这才恍然大悟。
    灶房里的事情已经忙完，李淑华、丘立扬都坐在院子里跟我们闲谈来了。老头子也被小孙儿找了回来。丘二娘就向大家说：“鸡儿杀啦，许下的愿总算还了。”
    “许的什么愿？”有人接着问。
    “你们忘啦？这批鸡儿刚孵出那天……。”
    “要是这样，我们可不敢吃妈妈这只鸡，谁能做的比妈妈还好！”李淑华笑着插了一句。她讲的是实话。老太太从去年秋天开始，没有一天清闲，晚上是福利委员，忙着领导大家整顿食堂和托儿所；白天是管理区的敬老院的院长，要照顾孤独的老人，还要领着他们种菜、养猪、养鸡，争取自给自足；深更半夜还常去公共食堂，替李淑华值夜班。因此，李淑华在被评为“五好炊事员”那天晚上，满怀激情地对人说：“这都是因为我有一个好婆婆，她也是我们的好领导！”
