    The Anhui and Sichuan Provincial Party Committees Deploy Combat Missions for Industrial Departments
    Resolutely Complete This Month's Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Hunan's Heroes Gather, Determined to Overfulfill the Great Leap Forward Plan and Prepare for Next Year's Production
    Xinhua News Agency report: Anhui Province's broad masses of workers, on the basis of comprehensively overfulfilling the September production tasks, are determined to raise the level of industrial production in October another step. According to preliminary plans, steel production in October should increase by 69.4% compared to September, pig iron production increase by 28.9%, copper production increase by 23.1%, and coal increase by 5.8%. Workers throughout the province are also striving to complete the October production tasks three to five days ahead of schedule.
    In order to ensure the early completion of the October industrial production plan, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recently convened a telephone conference of secretaries of regional and municipal committees to conduct specific research and deployment. The Provincial Committee believes that the major achievements in industrial production in September are mainly the result of conscientiously implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and resolutely opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. In October, all localities must continue to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, and launch a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. After achieving great achievements in September, some people may become complacent, develop a slack attitude of "taking a breather," and may also develop the idea of "production reaching its peak." These ideas must be prevented in a timely manner. Leading cadres at all levels must go to the forefront of production, personally direct operations, and especially strengthen the leadership of night and early shifts. All factories and mining enterprises must conscientiously do a good job in the third quarter's circular red flag evaluation work, and through evaluation and inspection, push the "ten comparisons" red flag competition movement further forward. At the same time, vigorously summarize and promote various advanced experiences.
    The key to completing the October industrial production tasks lies in whether transportation can keep up. In this regard, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee has taken some specific measures. First, strengthen scheduling, organize close cooperation between various departments, and speed up the turnover of vehicles and ships. Second, increase the carrying capacity of vehicles and ships, strive for more full loads, and eliminate the phenomenon of empty tonnage. Third, vigorously carry out a mass movement of short-distance transportation.
    Xinhua News Agency report: "Seizing every second, fighting for every ounce, completing the annual production plan and each month's production plan ahead of schedule," this is the combat mobilization slogan recently put forward by the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee on the production front.
    On October 1, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee convened a telephone conference on steel, iron, and coal. Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, spoke at the meeting. After analyzing the situation in September, where steel, iron, and coal all overfulfilled the production plans, he said: The production situation of steel, iron, and coal in the province is very good, and can be summarized in two sentences: full of vigor, all lines are victorious. Full of vigor is the result of opposing right-leaning tendencies. Opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale have accelerated the progress of all fronts. He said that the future task is to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule; there should only be overfulfillment and no deficits. After National Day, we must prevent complacency. All aspects and all units must seize every second and fight for every ounce to complete the production plan ahead of schedule as much as possible.
    In order to ensure the early and overfulfillment of the annual production plan, all aspects, all units, and all enterprises, down to the workshops, furnaces—converters, open hearth furnaces, blast furnaces—must formulate indicators and measures for early and overfulfillment of the annual production plan, as well as indicators and measures for early and overfulfillment of monthly production plans. In this way, there is a guarantee for the early and overfulfillment of the annual production plan. All aspects and all units should fully utilize their enthusiasm according to their own conditions and strive to overfulfill as much as possible. The more we overfulfill, the greater our contribution to the country, and the faster we can accelerate the country's construction speed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 5th: Hunan Province held its Fourth Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in late September, extensively exchanging advanced experiences in industry, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, etc., since the Great Leap Forward. It elected representatives of seventy-six advanced collectives and one hundred and fourteen advanced producers as representatives of Hunan Province to attend the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, Finance, and Trade.
    During the meeting, Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, Secretary Li Ruishan, and Chen Yufa, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, made reports to the representatives, calling on them to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, fight a great battle in the fourth quarter, comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's Great Leap Forward plan, and create conditions for next year's Great Leap Forward. After listening to the reports, the representatives discussed them in light of the conditions in their localities and units. Through discussion, everyone was full of confidence, and they expressed that under the leadership of the Party, they would hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, fight a great battle in the fourth quarter, create more outstanding achievements, and accelerate socialist construction.
    All the representatives attending the meeting passed a letter to the province's workers, calling on all workers in the province to adhere to putting politics in command, muster revolutionary vigor, and under the leadership of the Party, work together, strengthen unity, adhere to the Party's general line of socialist construction, support the People's Communes, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and with the vigor of running steel in a big way last year, fight a great battle in the fourth quarter, further launch a vigorous new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, ensure the comprehensive early and overfulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan in the fourth quarter, and prepare for next year's Great Leap Forward.

    安徽四川省委部署工业部门战斗任务
    坚决提前完成本月计划
    湖南群英集会决心超额完成跃进计划作好明年生产准备
    本报讯　安徽省广大职工在全面超额完成9月份生产任务的基础上，决心把10月份的工业生产水平再提高一步。根据初步计划，10月份钢的产量要比9月份提高69.4％，生铁产量提高28.9％，铜产量提高23.1％，煤炭提高5.8％。全省职工还争取提前三天到五天，完成10月份的生产任务。
    为了保证提前完成10月份的工业生产计划，中共安徽省委最近召开地、市委书记电话会议，进行了具体的研究和部署。省委认为：9月份工业生产上取得的重大成就，主要是认真贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议，坚决反右倾鼓干劲的结果。10月份各地要继续深入贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，继续反右倾鼓干劲，掀起一个更大的增产节约新高潮。在9月份取得了巨大的成就以后，有些人可能产生自满情绪，产生“歇一口气”的松劲思想，也可能产生“增产到顶”的思想。对这些思想必须及时防止。各级领导干部一定要到生产第一线去，亲自指挥作战，特别要加强夜班和早班的领导。各厂矿企业都要认真搞好第三季度的循环红旗评比工作，通过评比检查，把“十比”红旗竞赛运动再向前推进一步。同时，要大力总结和推广各种先进经验。
    要完成10月份各项工业生产任务，关键还在于交通运输能否跟上去。在这方面，中共安徽省委已采取了一些具体措施。首先，加强调度，组织各部门紧密配合，加快车船周转。其次，提高车船的载重量，争取多装满载，消灭虚吨位现象。第三，大力开展短途运输的群众运动。
    本报讯　“分秒必争，斤两必争，提前超额完成全年生产计划以及每个月的生产计划”，这是中共四川省委最近提出的生产战线上的战斗动员口号。
    10月1日，中共四川省委召开了钢、铁、煤电话会议。省委第一书记李井泉同志在会上讲了话。他在分析了9月份钢、铁、煤全都超额完成生产计划的情况以后说：全省钢、铁、煤的生产形势很好，可以用两句话概括：干劲十足，全线皆捷。干劲十足是反右倾的结果。反右倾、鼓干劲，促使各个战线加快速度前进。他说，今后的任务是要提前超额完成全年的生产计划，只能超额，不要欠账。国庆节以后，要防止松懈。各个方面、各个单位要分秒必争，要斤两必争，尽量提前超额完成生产计划。
    为了保证提前超额完成全年生产计划，各个方面、各个单位、各个企业一直到车间、炉子——转炉、平炉、高炉，都要订出提前超额完成全年生产计划的指标和措施，以及提前超额完成每月生产计划的指标和措施。这样，提前超额完成全年生产计划才有保证。各个方面、各个单位要根据自己的条件，充分发挥积极性，尽量多超额。超额越多，对国家的贡献就越大，就越能加快国家的建设速度。
    据新华社长沙5日电　湖南省在9月下旬举行了第四次先进集体和先进生产者代表会议，广泛交流了从大跃进以来在工业、交通、基本建设、财政贸易等方面的先进经验，选举了七十六个先进集体的代表和一百一十四名先进生产者为湖南省出席全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会的代表。
    会议期间，中共湖南省委第一书记张平化、书记李瑞山和湖南省总工会主席陈郁发，向代表们作了报告，号召代表们深入贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，大战第四季度，全面地完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，并且为明年的跃进创造条件。代表们在听了报告以后，结合本地和本单位的情况进行了讨论。通过讨论，人人信心百倍，纷纷表示要在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，大战第四季度，创造更出色的成绩，加速社会主义建设。
    出席会议的全体代表通过了给全省职工的一封信，号召全省职工坚持政治挂帅，鼓足革命干劲，在党的领导下，同心同德，加强团结，坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，支持人民公社，进一步巩固工农联盟，以去年大办钢铁的劲头，大战第四季度，进一步掀起轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮，保证在第四季度全面提前超额完成今年的跃进计划，并且为明年的跃进作好准备。
