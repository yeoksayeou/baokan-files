Politics is Always in Command
Persist in the policy of putting politics in command

Putting politics in command is our Party's long and glorious revolutionary tradition, and it is the fundamental guarantee for our people to continuously achieve victories in the cause of revolution and construction.

Putting proletarian politics in command is achieved through the leadership of the proletarian political party. Only by adhering to the leadership of the Party can we adhere to the proletarian political direction and realize the historical task of the proletarian revolutionary struggle. Since last year, the Party's general line for socialist construction has emitted immense radiance, the revolutionary mass movement has surged, and it has increasingly proved the great role of putting proletarian politics in command in socialist construction. The policy of "putting politics in command" has become increasingly popular. However, this does not mean that all our comrades understand and are good at adhering to this policy in all their work. Nor does it mean that no one doubts or even opposes putting politics in command. Those who doubt and oppose putting politics in command have put forward some erroneous arguments. We must thoroughly criticize these erroneous arguments and adhere to the policy of putting politics in command.

Some people say: "Putting politics in command cannot replace objective economic laws." They oppose putting politics in command to economic laws, and under the pretext of emphasizing the objective nature of economic laws, they negate the decisive role of putting politics in command in understanding, grasping, and applying economic laws. In fact, only by truly establishing the proletarian world outlook (that is, the dialectical materialist world outlook) and looking at problems from the Marxist standpoint and viewpoint can we discover and understand objective laws. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is a correct reflection of the objective laws of our country's socialist economic construction. Some people oppose "objective laws" to "putting politics in command," in fact, they regard "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" as the "economic laws" in their imagination. A very small number of right-leaning opportunists attempt to fundamentally negate the general line that truly reflects the laws of socialist construction, and they simply want to replace proletarian politics in command with bourgeois politics in command. There are also some people who are well-intentioned, but they do not understand the importance of putting politics in command in understanding, grasping, and applying objective laws, one-sidedly emphasizing objective conditions, and belittling the subjective initiative of people. Therefore, at one time, they had right-leaning and lax emotions to varying degrees. They did not do things that could be done through hard work, and they did not overcome difficulties that could be overcome through all means. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly put forward the instruction of "opposing right-leaning and encouraging hard work." This instruction reflects the requirements of the vast majority of cadres and the masses. We act in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, and with politics in command, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been further boosted, and production has been rising linearly by the ten-day period and by the month. Does this not exactly show how important putting politics in command is for understanding objective laws and promoting the development of production?

Some people say: "Putting politics in command cannot replace professional work." They do not see that there are two kinds of professional work, one is professional work that serves socialist politics, and the other is professional work that serves capitalist politics. No professional work can be commanded by anything other than politics. If it is not commanded by proletarian politics, it will be commanded by bourgeois politics. All our economic work, cultural and educational work, and military work are tools used by the proletariat to carry out revolutionary and construction struggles, and they are for the revolutionary interests of the proletariat and for the service of proletarian politics. We must put the positions of politics and professional work in the right place and put politics in the first place. Comrade Lenin said: "Politics is the concentrated expression of economics... politics cannot but take precedence over economics. To fail to affirm this is to forget the most elementary ABC of Marxism." As early as 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to us: "Thinking that military and politics are opposed to each other, and not admitting that military is only one of the tools to complete political tasks. Some even say 'If the military is good, politics will naturally be good; if the military is not good, politics will not be good,' which further believes that the military leads politics." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that if this kind of thinking develops, there will be a danger of deviating from the masses and leaving the leadership of the proletariat. In the field of literary and artistic work, he pointed out: "The position of the Party's literary and artistic work in the Party's entire revolutionary work has been determined and put in place; it is subordinate to the revolutionary tasks stipulated by the Party in a certain revolutionary period. To oppose this kind of placement will inevitably lead to dualism or pluralism, and its essence is like Trotsky's: 'Politics - Marxist; art - bourgeois.'" Either proletarian politics or bourgeois politics, it is either one or the other, so how can we not adhere to the Party's leadership and raise the banner of proletarian politics high? Of course, in order to do a good job, we should pay great attention to the improvement of professional skills and technology. But at any time, we must never let go of the leading aspect, that is, to use politics as the soul of professional work and to use politics to guide professional work and guide daily work. Without a clear political direction and without conscientiously doing political work and ideological work, then professional skills and technology are out of the question.

Some people say that "putting politics in command is contradictory to the principle of 'material incentives'." Our Party has always advocated combining political education of the masses with material incentives. Only by adhering to putting politics in command can we more correctly implement the principle of "material incentives." What is the greatest interest of the working people? This is to establish the most happy and beautiful socialist-communist society. Only with proletarian politics in command, resolutely and thoroughly implementing the general line of socialist construction, and building socialism in our country at the fastest speed, and further transitioning to communism, can we care for the masses from the most fundamental interests. Only by using such a political ideal to encourage and educate the masses can they work selflessly in the Great Leap Forward, regardless of remuneration. Some people think that only economic stimulation can encourage the enthusiasm of workers, and the socialist consciousness of the masses is placed in an extremely unimportant position. Therefore, what they call caring for the material interests of the masses is actually relaxing or abandoning political and ideological education for the masses. We adhere to putting politics in command, not only politically guiding the masses to fight for their fundamental and greatest interests, but also caring for the masses meticulously in daily life; not only caring for the masses in material life, but also caring for the masses comprehensively in politics and ideology. Since liberation, the continuous deepening of the Party's ideological and political work and the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life have made the broad masses increasingly see that personal and immediate interests depend on collective and long-term interests, and personal happiness depends on the consolidation and development of the socialist system. Communist consciousness and labor enthusiasm have greatly improved, so they more consciously subordinate immediate interests to long-term interests and carry out socialist construction with greater enthusiasm. Isn't this high degree of labor enthusiasm of the people the result of adhering to proletarian politics in command and adhering to the combination of political and ideological education and material incentives?

Criticizing the Fallacy of Opposing Putting Politics in Command
Marxism-Leninism has always emphasized putting politics in command. Putting politics in command is one of the fundamental symbols that distinguishes the Marxist-Leninist party from trade unionism, petty-bourgeois socialism, and all kinds of opportunist factions.

Right-leaning opportunists oppose the Party's policy of putting politics in command, and they rant that emphasizing putting politics in command violates the principle that the base determines the superstructure and that it does not respect economic laws. In fact, the weapon they found to attack putting politics in command is not Marxism, but the fallacy of Second International right-leaning opportunists.

We know that Lenin put forward a famous principle: "Politics is the concentrated expression of economics." This means that the basic economic interests of various classes must be concentrated and expressed as political demands, and the economic struggle between various classes must develop into political struggle; its highest form is the struggle to consolidate or oppose a certain regime. Therefore, political struggle is also a reflection of the economic movement law in the economic field in the superstructure.

During the period of socialist construction, there is still a class struggle between two roads, that is, there are still two political forces that play a fundamentally opposite role in economic development: one is the political demands of the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, and its ideological system, which "acts against the direction of economic development," it resists the realization of the socialist economic movement law; the other (which is the basic and dominant one) is the political demands of the proletariat and other working masses under the leadership of the proletariat - concentrated in the Party's political line and the proletarian dictatorship, which acts along the direction of economic development, it paves the way for the economic movement law. Therefore, putting politics in command is to give full play to the role of the socialist superstructure in paving the way for economic laws; of course, it is also to overcome the resistance of the remaining parts of the bourgeois superstructure to socialism. Obviously, putting proletarian politics in command and respecting socialist economic laws are not only not contradictory, but are precisely necessary to ensure the smooth realization of socialist economic laws.

For example, after the land reform, realizing collectivization is the requirement of objective economic laws. However, the proletariat and the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants under the leadership of the proletariat promote the realization of this law; while the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie resist the realization of this law, and after the realization of collectivization, the stubborn rich peasants still want to sabotage it. May I ask, is it beneficial to the realization of this economic law and considered respecting economic laws if we only see things but not people, bury ourselves in the technical business of sprayers and double-wheeled double-share plows and "do not talk about justice (socialism)"? Or is it beneficial to the realization of this law and considered respecting economic laws to implement putting politics in command, emphasize political work, and "constantly instill socialist ideas into the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies"?

For example, our Party implemented the nationwide rectification movement in 1957, implemented the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and correctly handled the contradictions among the people, paving a broader road for the law that socialist relations of production promote the development of productive forces. However, the bourgeois rightists resisted this law and launched a wild attack on the Party and socialism. Our Party led the people of the whole country to smash the rightists and implemented the nationwide rectification, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts achieved a decisive victory; thus, a vigorous upsurge of the Great Leap Forward was set off. May I ask, is it beneficial to the realization of the law that socialist relations of production promote the development of productive forces and considered respecting economic laws to implement the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts? Or is it beneficial to the realization of this economic law and considered respecting economic laws to close our eyes and not ask about politics, let the bourgeois rightists attack, let them usurp leadership, and transform the political life of our country according to the bourgeois model?

For example, there is also the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy. In formulating correct economic plans that reflect the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy, can we not consider the international environment? Can we not proceed from the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, not proceed from the 600 million population, not fully estimate the great subjective initiative of the people and the requirements of letting go of the masses...? In a word, without the Party's general line in command, what correct proportion of socialist economic development can there be? In addition, to make the national economic plan smoothly realized, is it not necessary to establish a national overall view? Is it not necessary to criticize departmentalism, localism, and capitalist management thinking? May I ask: is it respecting the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy to criticize departmentalism, localism, and capitalist management thinking, strengthen socialist, collectivist, and take-into-account the overall situation thinking, or to take the opposite approach?

The proletariat's politics - the Party's political line, is a concentrated reflection of the fundamental interests of the proletariat and other working people, and it is a concentrated reflection of their requirements for the realization of socialist economic laws. Therefore, the Party's policy of putting politics in command is by no means disrespectful of economic laws. On the contrary, it provides the necessary political conditions and ideological conditions for the realization of this economic law, and clears away the capitalist ideology and politics that hinder it.

Why do we say that the problem of putting politics in command is ultimately a problem of the Party's leadership? Because "classes are usually led by political parties," and the political program and political line of each class, which reflect their fundamental economic interests, are formulated by their political party (or political group). This is even more true for the proletariat. If the bourgeois political viewpoint can spontaneously arise from the prevailing phenomenon, then the proletarian political viewpoint cannot arise spontaneously, because it is science. Lenin taught us: "The working masses themselves can never create an independent ideological system in the process of their movement," so socialist ideas must be instilled into the working masses from the outside. Everyone knows that since Marx and Engels turned utopian socialism into scientific socialism, correctly stipulated the program of the proletarian political struggle, and organized the party leading the proletariat to carry out the revolution - the Communist Party, the proletariat has become a class for itself from a class in itself; that is to say, it has its own independent political program and direction of political struggle.

The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat, "in practice, it is... the most determined and always promotes the progress of the movement, and in theory, they are better than the rest of the proletariat in understanding the conditions, process, and general results of the proletarian movement." Therefore, the proletarian political program and the political line of each period are and must be formulated by its political party - the Communist Party. Obviously, without the leadership of the Party, there would be no proletarian politics in command. Therefore, putting politics in command is ultimately the Party in command. And opposing putting politics in command means not letting the Party's political program and political line grasp the masses and lead the movement, so it is actually denying the Party's leadership.

Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no revolutionary movement of the proletariat, and no victory of the proletarian revolution. Similarly, without the leadership of the Party, there would be no socialist construction, and no victory of socialist construction. However, a few people have confused ideas on this issue. They do not deny the Party's leadership in words, but they think that politics is not as important in the period of socialist construction as it was in the period of revolution. It is said that in the period of socialist construction, since the importance of technology has been raised to the most important position, politics is not so important. This is a wrong and simple technical point of view.

Yes, in the period of socialist construction, technical work has been raised to an important position. Socialist construction cannot be done without technology, just as revolutionary war cannot be done without guns. However, in the period of revolutionary war, it was precisely Comrade Mao Zedong, who attached great importance to armed struggle, who put forward: "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and we will never allow the gun to command the Party." This means that the Party and politics must be in command in the army and in military struggle, not the "gun." It was precisely this policy of putting politics in command that ensured that the army was the Party's and a docile tool of political struggle, and ensured the victory of the revolution. In the period of socialist construction, the relationship between politics and technology is, in principle, also like this: does the Party command technology or does technology command the Party? Does the politician lead the technical expert or does the technical expert lead the politician? The question is posed so sharply. If it is not the Party that commands technology, but technology that commands the Party, not the politician leading the technical expert, but the technical expert leading the politician, then it is not politics in command but "technology in command," which means that the direction and line of socialist construction will be lost, and it will spontaneously retreat to capitalism. Attaching great importance to technology is one thing, whether it can be in command is another, just as attaching great importance to "guns" is one thing, and whether it can be in command is another. Technology in command is the same as "the gun commanding the Party," that is, bourgeois politics in command, that is, denying the Party's leadership. Then, like "the gun commanding the Party," there will be no revolutionary proletarian army, and there will be no socialist construction.

### 政治永远是统帅

专栏：报刊文摘

　　政治永远是统帅
　　坚持政治挂帅的方针
    政治挂帅，是我党悠久而光辉的革命传统，是我国人民在革命和建设事业中不断取得胜利的根本保证。
    无产阶级政治挂帅，是通过无产阶级的政党的领导来实现的。只有坚持党的领导，才能坚持无产阶级的政治方向，实现无产阶级革命斗争的历史任务。去年以来，党的社会主义建设总路线发出了万丈的光芒，革命的群众运动汹涌澎湃，愈益证明了无产阶级的政治挂帅在社会主义建设中的伟大作用。“政治挂帅”的方针，越来越深入人心了。但是，并不是说，我们所有的同志都懂得并且善于在一切工作中坚持这一条方针了。更不是说，没有人怀疑、甚至反对政治挂帅了。那些怀疑和反对政治挂帅的人提出了一些错误的论调。我们必须彻底地批驳这些错误论调，坚持政治挂帅的方针。
    有些人说：“政治挂帅不能代替客观经济规律”。他们把政治挂帅同经济规律对立起来，在强调经济规律的客观性质的借口下，否定政治挂帅对认识、掌握和运用经济规律的决定作用。实际上，只有真正树立了无产阶级的世界观（即辩证唯物主义世界观），从马克思主义的立场、观点来看问题，才能够去发现客观规律和认识客观规律。党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，正是我国社会主义经济建设的客观规律的正确反映。有些人把“客观规律”同“政治挂帅”对立起来，其实是把“少慢差费”作为他们想像中的“经济规律”。极少数的右倾机会主义分子是企图由此从根本上否定真正反映了社会主义建设规律的总路线，他们无非是想用资产阶级的政治挂帅来代替无产阶级的政治挂帅。也有一些人，他们的心是善良的，但是他们不懂得政治挂帅对认识、掌握和运用客观规律的重要意义，片面强调客观条件，贬低人的主观能动作用，因而有一个时候他们在不同程度上产生了右倾松劲情绪，对于一些经过努力可以做到的事情，也不去动手做了，一些经过千方百计可以克服的困难，也不去克服了。党中央和毛泽东同志及时提出了“反右倾、鼓干劲”的指示，这一指示是反映了最广大干部和群众的要求的，我们按照这个指示的精神去做，政治挂了帅，干部和群众的干劲就进一步鼓起来，生产就按旬、按月地直线上升。这不是正好说明政治挂帅对认识客观规律、对促进生产的发展具有多么重大的意义吗？
    有些人说：“政治挂帅不能代替业务工作”。他们看不到：有两种业务工作，一种是为社会主义政治服务的业务，一种是为资本主义政治服务的业务。任何业务工作都不能不由政治来挂帅。不由无产阶级政治挂帅，便由资产阶级政治挂帅。我们一切经济工作、文化教育工作、军事工作都是无产阶级用以进行革命和建设斗争的工具，是为无产阶级的革命的利益，为无产阶级的政治服务的。我们都必须把政治和业务工作的位置摆正，把政治放在第一位。列宁同志说过：“政治是经济的集中表现，……政治同经济相比不能不占首位。不肯定这一点，就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。”毛泽东同志早在1929年的时候就向我们指出：“认为军事政治二者是对立的，不承认军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一。甚至还有说‘军事好，政治自然会好，军事不好，政治也不会好’的，则更进一步认为军事领导政治了。”毛泽东同志指出，这种思想发展下去，便有脱离群众，离开无产阶级领导的危险。在文艺工作方面，他指出：“党的文艺工作，在党的整个革命工作中的位置，是确定了的，摆好了的；是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。反对这种摆法，一定要走到二元论或多元论，而其实质就像托洛茨基那样：‘政治——马克思主义的；艺术——资产阶级的。’”或者无产阶级的政治，或者资产阶级的政治，非此即彼，又如何能不坚持党的领导把无产阶级的政治帅旗高高举起呢？当然，为了把工作搞好，我们应该十分注意业务和技术的提高。但是在任何时候，都决不能放掉主导的一方面，就是要以政治作为业务的灵魂，以政治来指导业务，指导日常工作。没有明确的政治方向，不认真做好政治工作和思想工作，那么业务也好，技术也好，一切都无从谈起的。
    有的人说“政治挂帅是同‘物质利益鼓励’原则相矛盾的”。我们党一贯主张把对群众的政治教育同物质鼓励结合起来。只有坚持政治挂帅，才能更正确地贯彻“物质鼓励”的原则。什么是劳动人民最大的利益呢？这就是建立人类最幸福、最美好的社会主义——共产主义社会。只有无产阶级政治挂帅，坚决彻底地执行社会主义建设总路线，以最快的速度在我国建成社会主义，并且进一步过渡到共产主义，才是从最根本的利益上关心群众。也只有以这样一种政治理想去鼓舞教育群众，他们才能在大跃进中奋不顾身、不计报酬地忘我劳动。有些人以为只有靠经济上的刺激，才能鼓励劳动者的积极性，至于群众的社会主义觉悟，则放在极不重要的地位，因而他们所说的关心群众的物质利益，实际上就是放松或者放弃对群众的政治思想教育。我们坚持政治挂帅，不仅从政治上引导群众，去为自己根本的最大的利益而斗争，而且在日常生活中无微不至地关怀群众；不仅从物质生活上关心群众，而且从政治上、思想上全面地关心群众。解放以来，党的思想政治工作的不断深入，人民物质文化生活的逐步改善，使广大群众日益看到个人的和眼前的利益依存于集体的和长远的利益，个人的幸福依存于社会主义制度的巩固和发展，共产主义觉悟和劳动积极性大大提高，从而更自觉地使眼前利益服从长远利益，以更高的热忱来进行社会主义建设。人民群众的这种高度的劳动热忱，难道不是坚持无产阶级政治挂帅、坚持政治思想教育和物质鼓励相结合的结果吗？
          （摘自上海“解放”第十九期陈丕显：“坚持政治挂帅，加强党对社会主义建设的领导”）
　　斥反对政治挂帅的谬论
    马克思列宁主义，从来就是强调政治挂帅的。政治挂帅，这是马克思列宁主义的党和工联主义、小资产阶级的社会主义、各色各样的机会主义派别区别开来的根本标志之一。
    右倾机会主义分子，反对党的政治挂帅的方针，胡说什么强调政治挂帅，就是违背了基础决定上层建筑的原理，就是不尊重经济规律。其实，他们找到的攻击政治挂帅的武器，不是什么马克思主义，而是第二国际右倾机会者的谬论。
    我们知道：列宁提出了一个有名的原理：“政治是经济的集中表现”。这就是说：各个阶级的基本的经济利益必然集中表现为政治要求，各个阶级之间的经济斗争必然发展为政治斗争；它的最高形式就是巩固或反对某种政权的斗争。所以政治斗争也就是经济领域内经济运动规律在上层建筑中的反映。
    在社会主义建设时期，还存在着两条道路的阶级斗争，就是说，还有两种政治力量，对经济发展起着根本相反的作用：一种是资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的政治要求，它的思想体系，这是“逆着经济发展方向起作用”的，它抵抗社会主义经济运动规律的实现；另一种（这是基本的占统治地位的）是无产阶级和在无产阶级领导之下的其他劳动群众的政治要求——集中为党的政治路线和无产阶级专政，这是沿着经济发展方向起作用的，它为经济运动规律开辟道路。所以，政治挂帅，也就是高度发挥社会主义上层建筑为经济规律开辟道路的作用；当然，也是克服资产阶级上层建筑残余部分对于社会主义的抵抗。很显然，无产阶级的政治挂帅和尊重社会主义经济规律不但毫无矛盾，而且恰恰是保证社会主义经济规律得以顺利实现所必需的。
    例如在土地改革之后，实现合作化这是客观的经济规律的要求。但是，无产阶级和在无产阶级领导之下的贫农、下中农促进这个规律的实现；而资产阶级、上层小资产阶级则抵抗这个规律的实现，在合作化实现之后，顽固的富农还要进行破坏。请问，我们还是只见物而不见人、埋头于喷雾器、双轮双铧犁的技术业务而“言不及义（社会主义）”有利于这个经济规律的实现、算作尊重经济规律呢？还是实行政治挂帅，强调政治工作，“向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”有利于这个规律的实现、算作尊重经济规律呢？
    例如，我们党于1957年实行全民整风运动、实行政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，正确地处理人民内部矛盾，为社会主义生产关系推进生产力这个规律开辟更广阔的道路。可是资产阶级右派却抵抗这个规律，发动了向党、向社会主义的猖狂进攻。我们党领导全国人民粉碎了右派，实行了全民整风，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利；于是就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产大跃进高潮。请问是实行政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命，有利于社会主义生产关系推进生产力这个规律的实现、算作尊重经济规律呢？还是闭眼不问政治、听凭资产阶级右派进攻，让它篡夺领导权、按资产阶级样式改造我们国家的政治生活有利于这个经济规律实现、算作尊重经济规律呢？
    再例如国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的规律。制订正确的反映国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律的经济计划，难道可以不考虑国际环境？可以不从巩固工农联盟、不从六亿人口出发，不充分估计人民群众的伟大主观能动性和放手发动群众的要求？……一句话，不以党的总路线挂帅，那能够有什么社会主义经济发展的正确比例可言呢？另外，使国民经济计划顺利实现，难道不需要树立全国一盘棋的全局观点？难道不需要批判本位主义、地方主义、资本主义经营思想？请问：是批评本位主义、地方主义、资本主义经营思想，加强社会主义、集体主义、照顾大局的思想，还是采取相反的作法，算是尊重国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的规律呢？
    无产阶级的政治——党的政治路线，是无产阶级及其他劳动人民根本利益的集中反映，是它们要求社会主义经济规律实现的集中反映，所以党的政治挂帅的方针，决不是不尊重经济规律，相反的是给这种经济规律发生作用以必要的政治条件、思想条件，扫清阻碍它的资本主义的思想和政治。
    为什么说，政治挂帅问题归根到底是党的领导问题呢？因为“阶级通常是由政党领导的”，各个阶级，反映它们的根本经济利益的政治纲领、政治路线，都是由它们的政党（或政治集团）制定的。对于无产阶级说来更是这样。如果说资产阶级的政治观点可以从流行的现象形态中自发产生出来，那末无产阶级的政治观点却不可能自发的产生，这就是因为它是科学。列宁教导我们说：“工人群众自己决不能在他们运动过程中创造独立的思想体系”，所以必须从外边向工人群众灌输社会主义思想。大家知道：从马克思、恩格斯把空想社会主义变成科学的社会主义，正确地规定了无产阶级的政治斗争纲领，组织了领导无产阶级进行革命的党——共产党，无产阶级才从自在的阶级成为自为的阶级；也就是说，有了自己的独立的政治纲领，政治斗争方向。
    共产党是无产阶级的先锋队，“在实践方面是……最坚决的、始终推动运动前进的部分，而在理论方面，他们比其余无产阶级群众优长于了解无产阶级运动的条件、进程及一般结果”。所以无产阶级的政治纲领和每个时期的政治路线，都是而且必须由它的政党——共产党制定出来。很清楚，如果没有党的领导，就没有无产阶级的政治挂帅。所以，政治挂帅，归根到底也就是党挂帅。而反对政治挂帅，就是不要党的政治纲领、政治路线去掌握群众、领导运动，所以实际上也就是否认党的领导。
    没有党的领导就没有无产阶级的革命运动，没有无产阶级革命的胜利。同样，没有党的领导就没有社会主义的建设，没有社会主义建设的胜利。但是，有少数人在这个问题上有糊涂观念，他们在口头上并不否认党的领导，但是他们认为在社会主义建设时期，政治不像在革命时期那样重要了。据说在社会主义建设时期，由于技术的重要性提高到最重要的地位，所以政治就不那么重要了。这是一种错误的单纯技术观点。
    不错，在社会主义建设时期，技术工作提到了重要地位，社会主义建设时期没有技术不行，就同革命战争时期没有枪杆子不行一样。但是，在革命战争时期，不是别人，正是高度重视武装斗争的毛泽东同志提出：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党。”这就是说，党、政治要在军队中和军事斗争中挂帅，而不是由“枪杆子”挂帅。正是这条政治挂帅的方针，保证了军队是党的、政治斗争的驯服工具，保证了革命胜利。在社会主义建设时期，政治和技术的关系，在原则上也是这样的：是党指挥技术还是技术指挥党？是政治家领导技术专家还是技术专家领导政治家？问题就是这样尖锐地摆着的。如果不是由党指挥技术，而是由技术指挥党，不是政治家领导技术专家，而是由技术专家领导政治家，那么就不是由政治挂帅而是由“技术挂帅”了，也就是说就失掉了社会主义建设的方向和路线，而要自发地退到资本主义去。高度重视技术是一回事，它能不能挂帅是另一回事，这正如同高度重视“枪杆子”是一回事，它能不能挂帅是另外一回事一样。技术挂帅就同
  “枪杆子指挥党”一样，就是资产阶级政治挂帅，就是否认党的领导。那样就同“枪杆子指挥党”就没有革命的无产阶级的军队一样，没有社会主义的建设。
