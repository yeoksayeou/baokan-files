   "Tender as Water, Fierce as Frost"
    ——Watching the Chao Opera "Cizhou Island"
    Wang Jisi
    In the coastal area of Chaozhou, Guangdong, there is a small island called Cizhou Island, where the story of the female poet Chen Biniang has been circulating for over six hundred years. Chen Biniang was the wife of Zhang Da, the Commander-in-Chief of Chaozhou during the late Southern Song Dynasty. When the Yuan army advanced southward and Zhang Da went to Yaishan to serve the king, Chen Biniang wrote a "Farewell to Husband Ballad" to send him off: "My husband knows there is a Song Emperor, leaving me to go to the vast sea; if villains come, your concubine will resist, see how the wind and frost fly like sword blades. Husband, go now, do not look back, the north wind whistles through the tiger gate trees; quickly send out proclamations to secure the road to Chaozhou, recover the Central Plains and spread the news. Husband, dedicate your body to the country, do not seek revenge for the family; concubine, dedicate my body to you, do not say that the military spirit will not uplift me. Wash away the feminine appearance of a thousand years, tear stains are gone, blood stains remain. Whip your horse, send off your boat; the country's hatred can be avenged, what does your concubine seek?"
    This is a moving and excellent poem, especially rare as it was written by a female poet nearly seven hundred years ago. Due to the incompleteness of historical materials, we don't know much about the deeds of this female poet today. Zhang Da once launched a night attack on the Yuan camp five days before the Song army was annihilated at Yaishan, as recorded in "Continuation of Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance." "Yaishan Chronicles" says that Zhang Da died for his country after the fall of the Song Dynasty, probably around that time. "Chaozhou Chronicles" says that Chen Biniang continued to lead righteous soldiers to fight against the Yuan army after bidding farewell to Zhang Da. These fragmented historical materials are the original sources for the Chao Opera "Cizhou Island" performed by the Guangdong Chao Opera Academy.
    "Cizhou Island" is a newly created historical drama. Based on these fragmented historical materials, the playwrights and performers have boldly imagined and carefully artistically arranged a series of perfect stage art images centered around Chen Biniang. Chen Biniang is a female poet and a patriotic person. She was so tender and affectionate when she sent Zhang Da to serve the king, and she must have been considerate and closely connected with the righteous soldiers around her. This is why she continued to unite her fellow villagers to fight against the Yuan army when the Song Dynasty had fallen, Zhang Da had died, and the situation was extremely unfavorable. Furthermore, judging from the lines "If villains come, your concubine will resist, see how the wind and frost fly like sword blades," and "The country's hatred can be avenged, what does your concubine seek?" she must have resolutely fought to the end against the traitor Zhang Hongfan and the foreign invaders of that time. The comrades of the Guangdong Chao Opera Academy, through the "Farewell to Husband Ballad" and the related scattered legends about Chen Biniang, grasped the characteristics of her personality, carried out artistic creation, and made her worthy of being placed alongside some brilliant patriotic female images in our classical opera, such as Hua Mulan, Mu Guiying, and Liang Hongyu.
    The personality traits embodied in Chen Biniang can be described by the two commonly used ancient Chinese phrases, "Tender as water, fierce as frost." The scene where she cuts her hair to bid farewell to her husband concentrates on showing her "tender as water" side. Precisely because she loved her heroic husband so deeply and cherished her happy married life so much, she hated the foreign invaders who destroyed her happy life and took her husband's life so intensely. Although Chen Biniang's character later developed to a higher level, even sacrificing herself to protect the righteous soldiers; however, as a housewife in the feudal era, her love for her righteous and patriotic husband must have been the starting point for her subsequent series of heroic actions. The playwright grasped this point, expressing Chen Biniang's deep affection for her husband when Zhang Da went to war, and carrying it through to the subsequent scenes, which is a relatively successful aspect of the author's handling.
    Chen Biniang's "fierce as frost" personality was already manifested when she strongly urged Zhang Da to go to war to serve the king. As the invaders' arrogance grew and the righteous soldiers' resistance became more and more difficult, this aspect of her personality became more and more prominent. Until she avenged the country, raised troops towards Yaishan, sang loudly "Mountains and rivers help me with a thousand pounds of strength," and slashed Zhang Hongfan three times in a row, she brought this aspect of her personality to a climax. However, the playwright and actors did not simplify this scene. When she saw a lock of her own hair that she had given to her husband in the hands of the enemy, she could not help but foresee that her husband might have already sacrificed himself, causing inner turmoil. However, in the face of this cruel reality, she did not waver or submit, but became even stronger. This highlighted the character's personality through a series of stage art images, giving her self-sacrifice in the next scene a solid ideological foundation, and the audience did not feel it was abrupt at all.
    The final scene is the final completion and high unity of these two aspects of Chen Biniang's personality. When Chen Biniang wanted to stay behind for a decisive battle to cover the retreat of the righteous soldiers, and the entire army knelt down together to ask her to retreat with them, when Chen Biniang saw that the entire army firmly refused to retreat and also knelt down to ask them to retreat as soon as possible, when Chen Biniang sacrificed herself to cover the entire army, still holding her sword upright and pointing one hand at the enemy, her moving image of sacrificing herself for the country left a deep impression on the audience.
    Chao Opera is a local opera formed by accepting the influence of Southern Opera of the Song and Yuan dynasties, as well as the Yiyang tune of the Ming Dynasty. Its characteristics are more singing and less dialogue, rich dance movements, and the music and singing retain many ancient melodies, and have the characteristics of the Yiyang tune's chorus. Chao Opera was on the verge of dying before the national liberation. The cruel child actor system caused many promising artists to be driven out of the art garden just as they were budding. In just ten years since the national liberation, Chao Opera has made great progress. I believe that in the warm sunshine of the Party, it will bloom even more brightly in the future.

   “柔情似水，烈骨如霜”
    ——看潮剧“辞郎洲”
    王季思
    在广东潮州沿海的地方有个小岛叫作辞郎洲，六百多年来流传着女诗人陈璧娘的故事。陈璧娘是南宋末年潮州都统张达的妻子。当元兵南下、张达出兵到厓山勤王时，陈璧娘写了一首“辞郎吟”送他：“丈夫知有宋天王，别吾去者海茫茫；后有奸宄妾抵挡，试看风霜飞剑铓。郎兹行，勿回顾，北风萧萧虎门树；传檄早定潮州路，恢复中原驰露布。郎有身，身许国，无以家为仇可复；妾有身，身许郎，勿谓兵气不我扬。一洗千秋巾帼态，泪痕乌在血痕在。策郎马，送郎舟；国仇可复，妾身何求。”
    这是一首激动人心的好诗，它出于近七百年前一个女诗人的手笔，尤其难得。由于历史资料的残缺，我们今天对这位女诗人的事迹知道得不多。张达在厓山宋军复没前的第五天，曾出兵夜袭元营，“续资治通鉴”有记载。“厓山志”说张达在宋亡后死难，大约就在这个时候。“潮州志”说陈璧娘在辞别张达后还督率义兵跟元兵作战。这些零星历史资料就是广东潮剧院演出的“辞郎洲”的原始素材。
    “辞郎洲”是新创作的历史剧，剧作者和演出的同志们根据这些零星的历史资料，加以大胆的想像和细致的艺术安排，塑造了一连串以陈璧娘为中心的完善的舞台艺术形象。陈璧娘是女诗人，又是爱国志士。她在送张达出兵勤王时是那样柔情脉脉，她对围绕在自己周围的义兵也必然是多方体贴，血肉相关，这才能在宋室已亡、张达已死、形势极其不利的时候，还继续团结乡亲跟元兵作战。再从“后有奸宄妾抵挡，试看风霜飞剑铓”，“国仇可复，妾身何求”等诗句看，她对汉奸张宏范以及当时的外来侵略者必然是坚决斗争到底的。广东潮剧院的同志们通过“辞郎吟”，以及有关陈璧娘的零星传说，掌握了她性格上的特征，进行艺术创造，使她可以跟我国古典戏曲里一些光辉的爱国妇女形象如花木兰、穆桂英、梁红玉等并列而毫无愧色。
    体现在陈璧娘身上的性格特征，可以用我国古代两句习用语“柔情似水，烈骨如霜”来形容。剧中比较集中地表现她“柔情似水”的一面的是她割发辞郎的一场。正由于她这样热恋她的英雄夫婿，这样爱重她的美满的夫妇生活，她才那样痛恨那破坏她的美满生活、夺去她丈夫的生命的外来侵略者。尽管陈璧娘的性格后来有更高的发展，最后甚至为保全义兵，牺牲自己；然而作为封建时代的一个家庭妇女，她对那具有正义感和爱国心的丈夫的爱情，不能不是她后来一连串英勇行为的出发点。剧作者抓住了这一点，在张达出征时，表现陈璧娘对丈夫的一往深情，而且把它贯串到后面各场去，这是作者处理得比较成功的地方。
    陈璧娘性格上“烈骨如霜”的一面在她开始力劝张达出兵勤王时就已经表现出来。跟着侵略者气焰的愈来愈嚣张，义兵抗战的愈来愈艰苦，她这一面的性格也愈来愈突出。直到她为国报仇、起兵向厓山、高唱“山河助我千斤力”、连砍张宏范三剑时，才把她性格的这一面引向了高峰。然而剧作者和演员并没有把这场戏简单化，当她从敌人手里看到自己赠给丈夫的一绺青丝时，她不能不预感到她丈夫可能已经牺牲而引起内心的震动。然而在这残酷的现实面前，她没有动摇、屈服，反而更坚强了。这就通过一连串的舞台艺术形象突出了人物性格，使她下一场的为国牺牲有了坚实的思想基础，观众一点也不觉得突兀。
    最后一场是陈璧娘这两方面性格的最后完成和高度统一。当陈璧娘要留后决战掩护义兵退却、而全军一齐下跪求她一同撤退时，当陈璧娘看到全军坚不肯退、也下跪求他们尽快撤退时，当陈璧娘为掩护全军、最后牺牲、还抱剑兀立、一手指向敌人时，她为国牺牲的动人形象给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    潮剧是接受了宋元南戏，以及明代弋阳腔的影响而形成的地方戏曲。它的特点是唱多白少，舞蹈身段丰富，音乐、唱腔里保存了许多古乐曲，而且带有弋阳腔帮腔的特点。潮剧在全国解放以前已经奄奄一息。残酷的童优制使许多有培养前途的艺人在刚刚爆出蓓蕾的时候就被从艺术园地上撵出去了。全国解放不过十年，潮剧有了很大的发展，我相信今后在党的温暖的阳光照耀下，一定会开出更鲜艳的花朵。
