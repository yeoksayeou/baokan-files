The Tenth Year of Harvest
The Rich Dujiangyan Irrigation Area is in the Midst of the Autumn Harvest
By Our Correspondent Sun Yuedong

	Now is the autumn harvest season in the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area. On the hundreds of miles of fertile land, there are boundless fields of golden crops everywhere. The mature rice stalks in the fields, divided into pieces by spiderweb-like channels, are drooping with heavy ears, crowded together. A few rice plants are bent over by the heavy ears. The farmers say with a smile, "The fallen rice fills the granary; the falling of the ripe rice is a sign of a bumper harvest."
	In the fields, the rush to harvest is everywhere. At daybreak, millions of laborers are already engaged in the harvesting battle. The sound of sickles, the rumble of threshing machines, and the sound of rice tumbling in threshing drums rise and fall. This is a wonderful symphony of harvest. The farmers threshing rice say happily, "This year, just listening to the sound of the threshing drum, 'pong dong, pong dong,' you know the harvest is pretty good." On the ridges of the fields, small sheds are built with mats, with bright red papers pasted on them reading: "High Efficiency Competition," and prizes for the winners of the high efficiency competition of the day are displayed on the table. The threshing drum with the red flag of "High Efficiency and High Quality Pace-Setter" is the winner of the most recent competition. After passing on good experiences to others, they are creating even better results. In many places, the harvest progress has doubled and the quality is finer and better due to the high efficiency competition. The grain-gleaning teams, composed of the elderly and children, are not to be outdone, following closely behind the threshing drums, searching for any lost rice ears. In order to reduce scattering and waste during transportation, commune members in various places pull mats to spread in the fields as temporary drying grounds, and the rice dried on the same day is immediately sent to the granary.
	Dujiangyan, an ancient water conservancy project with a history of more than 2,000 years, is already well-known at home and abroad. But what did the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area look like before liberation? During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this water conservancy project became a tool for the ruling class, landlords, and local bullies to make fortunes. They embezzled construction funds, causing Dujiangyan to be in disrepair for many years. As a result of infighting, Dujiangyan was in a dilapidated state, and the irrigated area shrank year by year. On the eve of liberation, the irrigated area shrank from three million mu to 1.9 million mu, and the number of farmland suffering from floods increased year by year.
	The day after the liberation of western Sichuan, a large number of People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately helped the farmers carry out large-scale renovation projects. The projects completed in the first three years alone were equivalent to the total of the projects renovated during the twenty-eight years of Kuomintang rule. The Fuquyan expansion and irrigation project, which had been clamoring to be built since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, was never seen. However, it was completed in the winter of 1952. After years of expansion, this main canal, more than 140 kilometers long, now irrigates an area of 1.45 million mu. Like the Fuquyan irrigation area, the Xiheyan, Dongshanyan, and Tongjiyan were successively built. The irrigation area was expanded from the original fourteen counties and cities to twenty-four counties and cities. The water of Dujiangyan flows through the western Sichuan plain, crossing mountains and ridges, irrigating vast hilly areas, expanding from the original three million mu of irrigated farmland to more than six million mu, increasing the irrigated area by more than double. Many places that were previously threatened by drought, many drylands, and rice paddies lacking water have all been transformed into high-yield fields that are guaranteed against drought and flood, increasing rice yields by about half.
	This year is the tenth year since the liberation of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area, and also the tenth year of bumper harvest. Although the harvesting of more than five million mu of mid-season rice is still in progress, and it is not possible to give a comprehensive and accurate figure at the moment, a bumper harvest is certain. Xinfan County, the banner of large-scale rice production last year, has increased production by another 10% to 20% this year on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Four communes have achieved a high-yield record of an average yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu on more than 20,000 mu of harvested land. This is indeed an extraordinary harvest because it reaped an unprecedented harvest last year, increasing the unit area yield of rice by 40%-50%, reaching 700 to 800 jin per mu, more than double that before liberation.
	During the autumn harvest season, I came to a place called Honglingge in Yongxing Commune, Wenjiang County. What appeared before me was a good field of crops, with each mu of rice yielding more than 750 jin. However, this place used to be a well-known low-yield area because the terrain was low-lying and the water could not be drained. It was only possible to harvest one crop of rice each year. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the farmers were full of energy, striving for the top, and increased the yield to 500 jin. In the past, farmers also wanted to transform the low-yield features of this place, but the agricultural cooperative had few people and little strength, and the land was scattered, so it had never been done. Last year, after the communalization, the entire commune mobilized 500 people, dug ditches to drain water, thickened the soil layer, and in one go, transformed the bad fields in half a month. Like these low-yield fields, more than one million mu were transformed in the first winter after the communalization last year, increasing production by 30%-40% in one season of rice alone. After the universal establishment of communes throughout the irrigation area, work was also started to reorganize and transform the chaotic canal system, implement shallow water irrigation, timely release of water to dry the fields, and rotating water use between upstream and downstream areas, so that the water of Dujiangyan can fully play its role in production. Last autumn, the communes extensively deep-plowed the land and applied fertilizer in layers, making the fertile land even more fertile. The rice planting density was further increased, increasing by 70% compared to last year. This summer, it encountered particularly heavy rainstorms and floods, but the flood prevention army promptly carried out dike protection and drainage, helping the fallen seedlings, overcoming the disaster, and achieving a bumper harvest.
	The farmers of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area have created brilliant achievements in continuing the Great Leap Forward this year. In addition to the bumper harvest of rice, the summer crops of wheat and rapeseed also achieved a bumper harvest this year, with both total output and unit area yield increasing by 50%. The previously low-yielding wheat also reached more than 400 jin per mu, catching up with the rice yield in the past, and increasing by more than double compared to the early days of liberation. The farmers are not complacent about these achievements. They continue to improve the multiple cropping index, treating one mu of land as two or three mu of land to cultivate. At present, the late autumn crops being planted while harvesting in various places have reached more than one million mu.
	During the harvest days, the farmers throughout the irrigation area put forward the slogan of harvesting, drying, and sending grain to the granaries at the same time. On the main roads and small roads, vehicles transporting grain are constantly running day and night. In order to speed up the progress of warehousing, many communes are harvesting during the day and sending grain to the granaries by moonlight at night. Chongqing, Dayi, Xinjin, and other counties have completed only 60% to 70% of the harvesting area, but have completed the task of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain ahead of schedule. The total amount of grain stored in the entire region has increased more than two times compared to the same period last year.
	With the increase in production, the lives of farmers have also undergone tremendous changes. More than five million farmers throughout the region have forever escaped the poverty of the pre-liberation days. The average person has more than 400 jin of grain per year, eats free in the canteen, and receives wages on time. The children are sent to nurseries and kindergartens, and the helpless elderly enter the nursing homes. The purchasing power of farmers has increased more than double that in the early days of liberation. Liu Shaoqing, secretary of the Zhenzi Commune Party Committee in Wenjiang County, told reporters that last year, about 10% of the farmers in this township did not have enough work points in the agricultural cooperative to cover the cost of food because they had few laborers and many people. This year, there is no such situation. Many communes have already started building some new residential houses for commune members, and the living conditions of farmers are improving. More than 250 small hydropower stations have been built successively on the crisscrossing rivers and canals in the irrigation area, adding countless night pearls to the rural night. This electricity is not only used for lighting in farmhouses, but also for rushing to harvest and plant, controlling rice stem borers, and engaging in sideline processing.
	This rich "granary" has transported more than 3.7 billion jin of grain in the more than five years from 1954 to the first half of this year alone, and the amount of grain transferred out in the first half of this year exceeded three times the amount transferred out in the entire year of 1952. People in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country have eaten the rice produced in the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area. With this year's bumper harvest, the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area will supply more grain to various places, powerfully supporting the socialist construction of the motherland.
	Dear readers, let me tell you a piece of good news. The Dujiangyan Management Office has recently made a new irrigation area plan: two new main canals will be built, and the irrigated area will be expanded from the current six million mu to 26 million mu, including the main production areas of grain, cotton, sugar cane, and other crops in the entire province. The Zipingpu and Yuzui hydropower stations, which are under construction, will also be completed successively around next year and 1961, with a power generation capacity of more than 300,000 kilowatts, supplying the electricity needs of industry and agriculture in the entire irrigation area and nearby areas. The future Dujiangyan Irrigation Area will be more vast, more prosperous, and more beautiful!

　　第十个丰收年
　　富饶的都江堰灌区在秋收大忙中
　　本报记者　孙跃冬
    现在，正是都江堰灌区的秋收时节。在纵横数百里的沃野上，无边无际，到处是一片金黄的庄稼。被蛛网般的渠道分割成一块块的农田里，成熟的稻谷秆垂着沉甸甸的穗子，在一起挤得密密麻麻。少数稻谷被沉重的穗子压得倒伏下来了。农民们笑着说：“谷（稻）倒装满仓，黄熟的稻谷倒了，是丰收年的征兆。”
    田野上，到处是抢收的战场。天刚亮，数百万劳动大军已经投入收割战斗。镰刀嚓嚓，打谷机轰隆隆和拌桶的拌禾声，此起彼落。这是一首绝妙的丰收交响乐。打谷子的农民高兴地说：“今年，只要听听打谷子的拌桶声，蓬冬蓬冬的，就知道这收成挺不错。”田坎上，用席子搭的小棚上，贴着的大红纸写着：“高工效擂台”，桌上摆着当日奖给高工效优胜者的奖品。拌桶上插着“高工效高质量标兵”红旗的，是最近一次评比中的优胜者。他们在把好经验传授给别人以后，又在创造着更优异的成绩。许多地方由于开展了高工效竞赛，使收割进度加快了一倍，而且质量更细更好。老人和孩子组成的拾粮队也不示弱，紧跟在拌桶后面，搜索着漏掉的稻穗。为了减少运进运出沿途抛撒，浪费损失，各地公社的社员把晒席拉来铺在田里作为临时晒场，当天晒干的稻谷立即送往粮库。
    都江堰，这个有两千多年历史的古代水利工程，早已驰名国内外。但是，解放前都江堰灌区是怎样一个面貌呢？在国民党反动统治时代，这个水利工程变成了统治阶级、地主、恶霸发财致富的工具。他们贪污修建经费，使都江堰年久失修；由于你争我夺的结果，把都江堰弄得破烂不堪，灌溉面积一年年缩小。解放前夕，灌溉面积由三百万亩缩小到一百九十万亩，遭受洪灾的农田一年年增加。
    川西解放后的第二天，大批解放军战士立即帮助农民进行大规模的兴修工程。仅最初三年完成的工程，就相当于国民党统治时期二十八年以来兴修工程的总和。从清朝光绪年间就嚷着要修建的富渠堰扩灌工程，一直不见踪影；但在1952年的一个冬天就修成了。经过逐年扩建，这条长一百四十多公里的干渠，现在扩灌面积达一百四十五万亩。像富渠堰一样的扩灌区，陆续又修成了西河堰、东山堰和通济堰，灌溉范围由原来的十四个县市，扩大到二十四个县市。都江堰的水通过川西平原，翻山越岭，灌溉了广大丘陵地区，由原来灌溉农田的三百万亩扩大到六百多万亩，增加灌溉面积一倍以上。许多过去受干旱威胁的地方，许多旱地和水源缺少的稻田，都一变而为旱涝保丰收的丰产田，稻谷的产量增加一半左右。
    今年是都江堰灌区解放后的第十年，也是第十个丰收年。虽然五百多万亩中稻的收割工作还在进行，一时还说不出全面确实的数字，但丰收是肯定了的。去年水稻大面积丰产的旗帜新繁县，在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又增产一成到两成，有四个公社在已收的两万多亩田地上，获得了平均亩产一千斤以上的高产纪录。这的确是一次不平凡的收成，因为去年这里获得了一次空前大丰收，水稻单位面积产量增加了40％—50％，每亩达到七、八百斤，比解放前增加一倍。
    秋收时节，我来到温江县永兴公社一个叫红陵阁的地方，眼前出现的是一片好庄稼，每亩水稻都收到七百五十多斤。但是，过去这里是有名的低产区，因为地势低洼，水排不出去，每年只能收一季水稻。去年大跃进中，农民鼓足干劲，力争上游，把产量提高到五百斤。过去农民也想改造这地方的低产面貌，但是农业社人少力量小，土地又分散，一直没有办到。去年公社化以后，全社出动五百人，开沟排水，加厚土层，一鼓作气，半个月就把坏田改好。像这样的低产田，去年公社化后的第一个冬天就改造了一百多万亩，仅一季水稻就增产30％—40％。全灌区普遍建立公社以后，还着手整理改造紊乱的渠系，实行了浅水灌溉、适时放水晾田和上下游间轮流用水，让都江堰的水，在生产上充分发挥它的作用。去年秋天各公社大量深耕土地，分层施肥，使肥沃的土地更加肥沃。水稻密植程度又进了一步，比去年增加70％的苗。今年夏天遇上特大的暴雨和洪水，但防洪大军及时进行了护岸排水，扶救倒伏的禾苗，战胜了灾害，取得了丰收。
    都江堰灌区的农民，在今年继续大跃进中，创造了光辉的成就。除了水稻大丰收之外，今年夏收作物小麦和油菜也都获得了大丰收，总产量和单位面积产量都增产50％。一向低产的小麦也达到每亩四百多斤，赶上了过去的水稻产量，比解放初期增产一倍以上。农民们对这些成绩并不自满，他们仍然不断地提高复种指数，把一亩地当成二亩、三亩地来种，现在各地边收边增种的晚秋作物已有一百多万亩。
    在丰收的日子里，全灌区的农民提出边收、边晒、边送粮食进仓的口号。大路上、小路上，送粮的车辆一天到晚不断。为了加快入仓进度，许多公社都是白天抢收，晚上趁着月光送粮入仓。崇庆、大邑、新津等县，收割面积才完成60％到70％，交公粮和出售余粮任务便提前超额完成了，全区粮食入库数字比去年同期增加两倍多。
    随着生产的增加，农民生活也发生了巨大变化。全区五百多万农民永远摆脱了解放前那种贫困的日子。每人平均一年有口粮四百多斤，在食堂里吃饭不要钱，还按时领取工资。孩子们送进了托儿所，幼儿园，无依无靠的老年人进了敬老院。农民的购买力比解放初期增长一倍以上。温江县镇子公社党委书记刘少清告诉记者，去年这个乡还有10％左右的农民，因为劳力少人口多，在农业社做的工分不够口粮钱，今年就没有这种情况了。许多公社已经着手修建了一部分新的社员住宅，农民的居住条件正在改善。在灌区纵横交错的河渠上，已陆续修建成小型水电站二百五十多处，为农村的夜晚增添了无数夜明珠。这些电力不仅供农家照明，还用来进行抢收抢种，治螟和从事副业加工。
    这个富饶的“粮仓”，仅从1954年到今年上半年的五年多时间内，调运出去的粮食达三十七亿多斤，而今年上半年粮食外调数量超过1952年全年外调数的三倍。全国有二十多个省市的人民吃到了都江堰灌区出产的大米。今年的大丰收，都江堰灌区将供给各地更多的粮食，有力地支援祖国的社会主义建设。
    亲爱的读者，让我告诉你们一个喜讯吧。都江堰管理处最近作出一个新的灌区规划：新修两条干渠，灌溉面积将由现在六百万亩扩大到二千六百万亩，包括全省粮、棉、蔗等作物主要产区。而正在修建中的紫坪铺、鱼嘴两个水电站，也将要在明年和1961年左右陆续建成，发电量可达三十多万瓩，供应整个灌区和附近地区工农业用电需要。未来的都江堰灌区将更辽阔、更富饶、更美丽！
