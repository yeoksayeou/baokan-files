Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The automatic interplanetary station launched by the Soviet Union will exist for a long time, and in any case not shorter than the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite.

The automatic interplanetary station, while continuing to operate, will pass through the Earth zone at a distance of at least two thousand kilometers from the Earth.

This was said by Dobronravov, a well-known Soviet scientist and Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, in a speech. On the occasion of the successful launch of the third cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union, many Soviet scientists have made speeches to clarify the role and significance of this cosmic rocket and the automatic interplanetary station.

Academician Barbarashov, a famous scientist and astronomer, said that the Soviet Union's launch of the third cosmic rocket proves that the Soviet Union has entered a period of planned conquest of cosmic space.

He said that the automatic interplanetary station is equipped with sophisticated instruments that can obtain information about the far side of the moon that observers on Earth have never seen. Special centers on Earth can control the instruments loaded on the automatic interplanetary station. The automatic interplanetary station can also be observed from the Earth when it returns.

Ponayaetov, a physicist from Leningrad, said that the flight route of the new spacecraft successfully launched by the Soviet Union today is very important for obtaining scientific intelligence about the moon. He said that the complete set of scientific instruments makes it possible to obtain materials on the shape of the moon and the distribution of matter inside the moon, which is of great significance for future human spaceflight.

When talking about the operation of the automatic interplanetary station, Feiinsky, a famous scientist and Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, said that specialized centers on Earth can control the instruments installed in the automatic interplanetary station, and this control can be carried out within a distance of 400,000 kilometers.

Abdullayev, President of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences and winner of the Lenin Prize, said that from the launch of the third cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union, we can boldly say that all roads to the universe are open in front of Soviet science and technology. The flight of the automatic interplanetary station, launched on the second anniversary of the launch of the world's first Earth satellite by the Soviet Union, proves the Soviet Union's strong potential in completing interplanetary flights.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th dispatch: The news of the successful launch of the third cosmic rocket with an automatic interplanetary station by the Soviet Union spread early this morning, and the people of Moscow felt exceptionally joyful and encouraged.

Today is Sunday. After hearing the news, Muscovites immediately got up, turned on the radio, and listened to the announcement repeatedly broadcast by the radio station. People excitedly pointed out that the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket equipped with an interplanetary station less than a month after the launch of the moon rocket, which shows that the Soviet Union has taken another big step forward in automatic control technology and cosmic exploration.

Today is the second anniversary of the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union, and people here excitedly pointed out that the progress of Soviet science and technology in the past two years is really amazing.

Today, "Pravda" published a commemorative article on the second anniversary of the launch of the first artificial satellite, saying that the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union opened a new era for mankind to conquer nature. The historical significance of this victory lies in the fact that it showed the world the powerful creative power of the socialist system. This victory of the socialist country encouraged people all over the world. The enemies of socialism were frightened and disappointed by this victory of the Soviet Union. This victory proved that Soviet science, technology and industry have reached a very high level.

Today, "Izvestia" also published an article saying that only two years have passed since the first artificial satellite of the Soviet Union was launched, and during this period, people have already seen artificial planets rise into space, and this is just the beginning. Reality is moving forward so quickly that even the most courageous fantasies cannot predict how mankind will become the master of the solar system and its resources after hundreds or thousands of years.

    苏联进入有计划征服宇宙空间时期
    苏联科学家谈胜利发射第三个宇宙火箭的意义
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联发射的自动行星际站将会存在很久，无论如何也不会比苏联的第三个人造地球卫星存在的时间短。
    自动行星际站在继续运行中将在离地球至少二千公里的地方经过地球区。
    这是苏联著名科学家、物理数学博士多勃隆拉沃夫在发表谈话时说的。在苏联成功地发射第三个宇宙火箭之际，苏联许多科学家纷纷发表谈话，阐明这个宇宙火箭和自动行星际站的作用和意义。
    著名科学家、天文学家巴尔巴绍夫院士说，苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭证明，苏联已经进入了有计划地征服宇宙空间的时期。
    他说，自动行星际站上装载有复杂的仪器，这种仪器可以得到地球上的观察家从来没有看到过的月球背面的资料。地球上的特殊中心可以控制自动行星际站上装载的仪器。自动行星际站在返回时，还可以从地球上观测到。
    列宁格勒物理学家波纳耶托夫说，苏联今天发射成功的新的宇宙飞船的飞行路线对获得有关月球的科学情报是非常重要的。他说，整套的科学仪器使得能够获得有关月球的形状和月球内部物质分布情况的材料，这对未来人类的宇宙飞行具有极其重大意义。
    著名科学家、物理数学博士费金斯基在谈到自动行星际站的工作情况时说，地球上的专门中心可以操纵自动行星际站中装置的仪器，这种操纵能够在四十万公里的距离内进行。
    乌兹别克科学院院长、列宁奖金获得者阿卜杜拉耶夫说，从苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭我们可以大胆地说：在苏联科学和技术面前，通向宇宙的一切道路都是敞开的。在苏联发射世界上第一个地球卫星两周年之际发射的自动行星际站的飞行，证明了苏联在完成星际飞行方面的雄厚潜力。
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联成功发射带有自动行星际站的第三个宇宙火箭的消息在今天早上传出后，莫斯科人民感到异常欢欣鼓舞。
    今天是星期天，莫斯科市民听到这个消息后，立刻起床，打开收音机，收听电台一再广播的公报。人们兴奋地指出，苏联在离月球火箭的发射还不到一个月的时间，就发射装有行星际站的宇宙火箭，这说明苏联在自动控制技术和宇宙探测方面又前进了一大步。
    今天是苏联第一个人造地球卫星发射两周年，这里的人们兴奋地指出，在这两年间，苏联科学技术的进步，实在令人惊叹不已。
    “真理报”今天就第一个人造卫星上天两周年发表纪念文章说，苏联第一个人造地球卫星的发射开辟了人类征服自然的新纪元。这个胜利的历史意义在于，它向全世界显示了社会主义制度强大的创造力量。社会主义国家的这一胜利鼓舞了全世界的人们。社会主义的敌人却因苏联这一胜利而引起恐惧和失望。这个胜利证明了苏联的科学技术和工业已经达到极高的水平。
    “消息报”今天也发表文章说，苏联第一个人造卫星上天后只过了两年，在这段时间，人们就已经看到人造行星升上太空，而这不过是一个开始。现实是这样快地向前飞奔，即使是最勇敢的幻想，也无法预定经过了几百年、一千年以后，人类将会怎样变成太阳系和它的资源的主人。
