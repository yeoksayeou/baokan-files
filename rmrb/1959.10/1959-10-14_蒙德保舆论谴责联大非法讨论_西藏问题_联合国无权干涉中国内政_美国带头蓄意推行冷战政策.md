Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 13th: The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published a commentary today, exposing and condemning the international reactionaries headed by US imperialism for their despicable conspiracy to discuss the so-called "Tibet issue" at the United Nations General Assembly. The commentary stated that Soviet government leader Khrushchev's visit to the United States was an important step in eliminating the "Cold War" and created a new atmosphere for international relations. However, some Westerners who have lost their minds and are unwilling to abandon the "Cold War" are trying hard to obstruct the improvement of the international atmosphere and are attempting to have the United Nations General Assembly discuss the so-called "Tibet issue."

　　The commentary said that the sole purpose of the slanderous proposal put forward by international reactionaries is to divert people's attention from major international issues and manipulate the United Nations to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

　　The commentary emphasized that imperialism has no right to interfere in China's internal affairs, and their slander against China will not cause any loss to the People's Republic of China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 13th: "Neues Deutschland" published a commentary today entitled "Abusing the United Nations Platform," condemning the United Nations General Assembly's attempt to discuss the so-called "Tibet issue."

　　The commentary said: "Cold War" creators are currently attempting to use their position in the United Nations to stir up new unrest. The resolution to include the "Tibet issue" on the agenda of this session of the United Nations General Assembly is illegal because Tibet has always been an indisputable territory of China. No interference in the internal affairs of other countries is clearly stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

　　The commentary said that the motivation of those countries that proposed discussing the "Tibet issue" is to deliberately continue to implement a Cold War strategy. The commentary called for a complete stop to this continuous violation of the United Nations Charter. This behavior damages the reputation of the United Nations and threatens peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 13th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary today stating that the recent resolution passed by the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to include the so-called "Tibet issue" on the UNGA agenda is a shameless resolution. It is not only illegal but also a rude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

　　The commentary pointed out that this shameless resolution was passed under the manipulation of "Cold War" forces. They are attempting to use this to divert the UNGA's attention from truly important and urgent issues related to easing international tensions, and to further intensify the tense situation in Southeast Asia.

　　The commentary concluded by saying that this resolution tarnishes the United Nations, this world organization, and puts it on a path that is fundamentally opposed to the purpose for which it was established, the beginning of the easing of international tensions, and the interests of the people of all countries.

　　蒙德保舆论谴责联大非法讨论“西藏问题”
    联合国无权干涉中国内政
    美国带头蓄意推行冷战政策
    新华社乌兰巴托13日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表评论，揭露和谴责以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派企图在联合国大会上讨论所谓“西藏问题”的可耻阴谋。评论说，苏联政府领导人赫鲁晓夫访美是消除“冷战”的一个重要步骤，为国际关系创造了一种新的气氛。但是，西方的一些失去理智和不愿意放弃“冷战”的人却竭力阻挠改善国际气氛而企图使联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    评论说，国际反动派提出这个诽谤性的提案的目的只有一个，就是转移人们对重大国际问题的视线，操纵联合国粗暴地干涉中华人民共和国的内政。
    评论强调说，帝国主义根本无权干涉中国的内政，他们对中国进行的污蔑不会给中华人民共和国带来任何损失。
    新华社柏林13日电　“新德意志报”今天发表了题为“滥用联合国讲坛”的评论，谴责联合国大会企图讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    评论说：“冷战”制造者，目前正在企图利用他们在联合国中的地位来掀起新的不安。把“西藏问题”列入本届联合国大会议程的决议是非法的，因为西藏历来就是中国的不容置疑的领土。不许干涉各国内政，这是联合国宪章所明文规定的。
    评论说，那些提出讨论“西藏问题”的国家的动机，是蓄意继续执行冷战的策略。评论要求完全制止这种连续违反联合国宪章的行为。这种行为损害了联合国的声誉和威胁着和平。
    新华社索非亚13日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”今天发表评论说，联合国大会总务委员会最近通过的把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程的决议是一个无耻的决议，它不仅是非法的，而且是对中华人民共和国内政的粗暴干涉。
    评论指出，这个无耻的决议是在“冷战”势力的操纵下通过的。他们企图以此来转移联大对与缓和国际紧张局势有关的真正重要的和刻不容缓的问题的注意，更加加剧东南亚的紧张局势。
    评论最后说，这个决议沾污了联合国这个世界组织，使它走上了同它建立的目的、同国际紧张局势的开始缓和以及各国人民的利益根本对立的道路。
