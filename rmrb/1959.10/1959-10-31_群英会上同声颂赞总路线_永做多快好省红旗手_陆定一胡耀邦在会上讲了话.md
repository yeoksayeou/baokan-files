Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: The National "Heroes' Meeting" continued its plenary session today. The speeches of representatives and specially invited representatives from light industry, handicrafts, culture, education, health, science, and technology showed that, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the broad masses of workers in all walks of life in our country are striving for progress and advancing bravely, and various construction undertakings are flourishing and leaping forward in an all-round way.

Representatives from cotton mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shaanxi reported on their achievements in the struggle for the high-speed development of the textile industry. Zhang Ming, a representative from Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, said that although most of the factory's equipment was old machinery from 1914, thanks to the ideological liberation, breaking with the old and establishing the new, the speed of the machines had increased rapidly. After increasing the speed of spinning 21-count yarn from more than 200 revolutions to 400 revolutions, they increased it sharply to 500 revolutions in September this year. Now, the output of one spindle is close to the output of two spindles before the Great Leap Forward, and one worker is doing the work of one and a half people. While the machine speed has doubled, they have also transformed the old factory, which originally could only produce a dozen ordinary products, into a multi-variety factory that mainly produces high-grade products. The factory's product variety reached 242 kinds. The highest count is 200-count high-grade cotton yarn.

The speeches of Sun Guizhen, a weaving worker from Tianjin State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, and Zhao Mengtao, a fine yarn doffer from Northwest State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill, vividly demonstrated the indomitable will of Chinese textile workers to strive for the high-speed development of the textile industry. Sun Guizhen said: "Implementing high speed is a good way to develop the textile industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. I am determined to always be a red flag bearer for more, faster, better, and more economical results." In order to overcome the difficulties of not being able to keep up with the operation in the early stage of accelerating the speed of the loom, Sun Guizhen secretly got up late at night after her mother, brother, and sister were asleep, and used the room as a workshop to explore new patrol routes that meet the needs of high speed and high output, thus increasing the ability to watch from ten machines to twelve, and the output per shift from 31.21 yards to 39.7 yards. Zhao Mengtao is also a brave and persistent pursuer of high speed. In order to master new splicing experience, she practiced again and again on the car, and insisted on hard practice even when her fingers were worn out. In this way, she finally increased the speed of splicing from 15 roots per minute to 20 roots. From May 1952 to September this year, she comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan on a monthly and balanced basis, saving more than 12,000 taels of cotton, and helped 12 people become advanced producers. Zhao Mengtao said heroically at the meeting today: "The Party's General Line has illuminated my heart. As long as it is for the realization of the General Line, I will take the lead in doing even the most difficult work."

China's silk and embroidery production, which are famous at home and abroad, have also released their brilliance under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, just like the textile industry. Ma Zugen, a designer from Hangzhou Victory Silk Sample Factory, and Gu Wenxia, director of the Embroidery Experimental Workshop of Suzhou Arts and Crafts Research Institute, who spoke today, are advanced producers with outstanding achievements in silk weaving and embroidery.

Ma Zugen said that from 1956 to now, with the cooperation and help of his comrades, he has successfully designed 102 new varieties of silk. In order to create higher-grade and more exquisite products, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and this year, he designed many new products with novel patterns. The Dongfeng Silk, which combined printing, weaving, and digging flowers and woven last year, has won high praise in the international market. In order to design the pattern of Dongfeng Silk, he traveled around, observed in many ways, and looked for design themes from the motherland's magnificent construction and magnificent mountains and rivers.

The speech of embroidery worker Gu Wenxia at the conference today aroused great interest among the representatives. When Chinese handicrafts were exhibited in London, England in 1956, she went there to perform embroidery on the spot, and her skillful hands caused a sensation throughout London. She introduced that with the development of the motherland's economic construction, the Suzhou embroidery production, which was on the verge of extinction before liberation, has achieved rapid development after liberation, especially in the Great Leap Forward. From January to August this year, the output of Suzhou embroidery has reached 81,900 pieces, an increase of 125% compared with the same period last year; in the mass technical innovation movement, they have also improved and created more than ten new needle methods and new varieties, such as double-sided hair embroidery, virtual needle double-sided embroidery, and a variety of borrowed color embroidery, all of which have reached a very high artistic level. Their products have been exhibited in more than 50 countries, including the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Italy, and have been widely praised. Gu Wenxia said that in the future, they will create more new products that can reflect the new era on the basis of inheriting the original style of Suzhou embroidery, so that Suzhou embroidery can shine more brilliantly.

The food industry, which is closely related to people's lives, has also achieved rapid development in the Great Leap Forward. Gong Yingduan, deputy director of Jieyang Sugar Factory in Guangdong Province, and Buren, deputy director of Hailar Dairy Factory in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, introduced the development of the sugar industry in Guangdong and the dairy industry in Inner Mongolia to the conference today. Gong Yingduan said that under the guidance of the Party's policy of giving equal importance to heavy industry and light industry, the sugar industry in Guangdong has developed rapidly. In the sugar pressing season from 1958 to 1959 alone, the province's increased pressing capacity reached more than 10,000 tons, exceeding the total of the 17 years before liberation. In 1958, the province produced more than 430,000 tons of sugar, equivalent to five and a half times that of 1949, accounting for about 47% of the country's sugar production. Now Guangdong has become a sugar industry base in my country. Buren introduced that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an important animal husbandry base in the motherland, but there was no dairy processing plant before liberation, and a large amount of milk could not be used, and even spoiled in vain. Now Inner Mongolia has newly built 56 dairy processing plants and many animal product processing plants, and has built the Yakeshi milk powder factory, which is automated from production to packaging, and the Hailar dairy factory, which can process 100 tons of milk a day. In the Great Leap Forward, the dairy industry in Inner Mongolia not only developed extremely rapidly in quantity, but also the quality of products has rapidly improved. The quality of the cream produced by some factories has exceeded the national standard for top-quality products and is sold at home and abroad, winning praise.

Chen Xingchu, the head of the condensation section of Shanghai Limin Pharmaceutical Factory, said in his speech that their factory was originally a "lane" factory with only 44 people, but since the Great Leap Forward, it has developed from producing ordinary tablet medicines to manufacturing synthetic raw material medicines in less than a year, and has successfully manufactured the powerful bactericide "Furacilin," which is widely used, for the first time in China.

Hou Debang, the head of the Central Culture, Education, Health and Science Department Delegation attending the meeting, said in his speech that under the situation of the national comprehensive leap forward with steel as the key link, science, culture, education and health undertakings serving socialist production and construction have also gained rapid development. Through successive political and ideological education movements, through going down to the countryside for training and various labor practices, the broad masses of science, culture, education, and health workers have initially formed and are forming a new type of team armed with Marxism-Leninism.

Shen Jie, a photographer from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, a specially invited representative to the conference, reflected the soaring enthusiasm of Chinese cultural workers to strive to serve socialism. Since 1958, Shen Jie has accompanied my country's mountaineers and mountain survey teams several times, and has climbed more than a dozen snow-capped mountains and glaciers with an altitude of 4,000 meters to 7,000 meters above sea level, and recorded many precious and unforgettable images for the people of the country. During the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary ruling clique in Tibet, Shen Jie was in Lhasa, and he risked his life to film the criminal activities of the rebels at that time. Shen Jie said that if he has any courage in his work, it is first of all the result of the Party's education and training.

Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at today's meeting.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Dawa, a blacksmith from Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory of the Tibet Transportation Bureau, Gao Fengqin, deputy director of the Family Committee of Shenyang Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory, Hao Fengtang, deputy director of Delingha Farm in Qinghai Province, Li Zhiming, physician from the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Ministry of Health, Li Jinglan, teacher from Lanzhou Workers' Children's Primary School in Gansu, Wang Jinyu, leader of the coal mining team of Ningxia Shitanjing Open-pit Coalfield Construction Company, and Zhou Fengming, director of Beijing Electronic Tube Factory.

The conference will continue tomorrow.

    群英会上同声颂赞总路线
    永做多快好省红旗手
    陆定一胡耀邦在会上讲了话
    据新华社30日讯　全国“群英会”今天继续大会发言。来自轻工业、手工业、文教卫生、科学技术等各个战线上的代表和特邀代表的发言表明，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国各行各业的职工群众人人力争上游，奋勇前进，各项建设事业正在百花齐放，全面跃进。
    来自上海、天津、陕西棉纺厂的代表，在会上汇报了他们在为高速度发展纺织工业的斗争中取得的成就。上海国棉二厂代表张明说，他们的工厂虽然大部分设备是1914年的老机器，但是由于广大职工在大跃进中解放思想，破旧立新，机器转数飞快提高。他们把纺二十一支纱的转速从二百多转提高到四百转以后，今年9月又猛加到五百转。现在，一个纱锭的产量接近了大跃进以前两个纱锭的产量，一个工人做着一个半人的工作。在机器转速成倍提高的同时，他们还把原来只能生产十几种普通产品的老厂，改造成为以生产高级产品为主的多品种的工厂。全厂的产品品种达到二百四十二种。最高支数有二百支高级棉纱。
    天津国棉二厂织布工孙桂珍和西北国棉一厂细纱挡车工赵梦桃的发言，生动地表明了我国纺织工人力争高速度发展纺织工业的顽强意志。孙桂珍说：“实行高速化，正是多快好省发展纺织工业的好办法。我决定永远做一个多快好省的红旗手。”孙桂珍为了克服布机转速加快初期操作一时跟不上的困难，她曾深夜里等妈妈、弟弟和妹妹都睡了，悄悄爬起来，把房间当车间，探求适应高速高产需要的新的巡回路线，因而使看台能力从十台增加到十二台，台班产量从三十一点二一码提高到三十九点七码。赵梦桃也是一位高速的勇敢坚持者。她为了掌握新的接头经验，在车上练了又练，手指磨破了还在坚持苦练。这样她终于使接头的速度由原来每分钟十五根提高到二十根。她从1952年5月到今年9月，按月均衡全面地超额完成国家计划，节约棉花一万二千多两，并且帮助十二个人成为先进生产者。赵梦桃今天在大会上豪迈地说：“党的总路线照亮了我的心，只要为了实现总路线，再困难的工作我也带头去干。”
    名闻中外的我国丝绸、刺绣生产，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，同纺织工业一样放出了异采。今天发言的杭州市胜利丝绸试样厂设计员马祖根、苏州市工艺美术研究所刺绣实验工场主任顾文霞，就是丝织、刺绣方面成绩卓越的先进生产者。
    马祖根说，从1956年到现在，他在同志们的合作和帮助下，已经设计成功一百零二种丝绸新品种。为了创造更高级更精美的产品，在大跃进的1958年和今年，他又设计出了许多花样新颖的新产品。去年织成的印花、织花、挖花三者合一的东风绸，博得了国际市场很高的评价。为了设计东风绸的图案，他曾到处奔走，多方观察，从祖国的宏伟建设和壮丽山河中寻找设计题材。
    刺绣女工顾文霞今天在大会的发言，引起了代表们很大的兴趣。1956年中国手工艺品在英国伦敦展出时，她曾到那里当场表演刺绣，以她的一双巧手轰动过整个伦敦。她介绍说，随着祖国经济建设的发展，解放前奄奄一息的苏绣生产，在解放后特别是在大跃进中获得了飞速发展。今年1至8月份，苏绣产量已经达到八万一千九百件，比去年同期增长125％；在群众性的技术革新运动中，他们还改进和创造了十多种新针法、新品种，其中如双面发绣、虚针双面绣和多种借色绣，这些都达到很高的艺术水平。他们的产品曾经先后在苏联、德意志民主共和国、英国、瑞士、意大利等五十多个国家展出，得到普遍赞扬。顾文霞表示，他们今后要在继承苏绣原有风格的基础上，创造出更多的能够反映新时代面貌的新产品，使苏绣放出更加灿烂的光采。
    同人民生活有着密切关系的食品工业在大跃进中也获得了迅速发展。广东省揭阳糖厂副厂长龚应端和内蒙古自治区海拉尔乳品厂副厂长布仁，今天向大会介绍了广东制糖工业和内蒙古乳品工业的发展情况。龚应端说，在党的重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针指引下，广东的制糖工业发展很快。单是1958年到1959年的榨糖季节中，全省增加的压榨能力就达到一万多吨，超过了解放前十七年的总和。1958年全省产糖四十三万多吨，相当于1949年的五倍半，约占全国产糖量的47％，现在广东已经成为我国一个糖业基地。布仁介绍说，内蒙古自治区是祖国一个重要畜牧业基地，但是解放前没有一个乳品加工厂，大量的牛奶不能利用，甚至白白坏掉。现在内蒙古已经新建了五十六座乳品加工厂和许多畜产品加工厂，并且建成了从生产到包装都是自动化的牙克石乳粉厂和一天就能处理一百吨牛奶的海拉尔乳品厂。在大跃进中，内蒙古的乳品工业不仅在数量上发展极快，并且产品质量也迅速提高，有的厂生产的奶油，质量超过了国家规定的特级品标准，远销国内外，博得好评。
    上海利民药厂缩合工段长陈性初在发言中说，他们的工厂原来是一家只有四十四人的“弄堂”工厂，但是大跃进以来，不到一年就从生产普通片剂药品发展到制造合成原料药品，并且在国内第一次制造成功了用途很广的强力杀菌剂“呋喃西林”。
    出席大会的中央文教、卫生、科技部门代表团团长侯德榜在发言中说，在全国以钢为纲、全面跃进的形势下，服务于社会主义生产建设的科学、文化、教育、卫生事业，也获得了飞跃的发展。广大科学、文化、教育、卫生工作者通过历次政治思想教育运动，通过下放锻炼和各种劳动实践，已经初步形成和正在形成为一支马克思列宁主义武装起来的新型队伍。
    大会特邀代表、中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师沈杰的发言，反映了我国文化工作者努力为社会主义服务的冲天干劲。从1958年以来，沈杰曾几次随同我国的登山运动员和爬山勘察队，历经艰险，爬登了十数座拔海四千米到七千多米高的雪山和冰山，为全国人民纪录下许多珍贵的、令人难忘的镜头。西藏上层反动集团发动武装叛乱期间，沈杰正在拉萨，他曾冒着生命危险，拍摄下了当时叛匪们的罪恶活动。沈杰说，假若说他在工作中还有一点勇敢的话，那首先是党的教育和培养的结果。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理陆定一，共青团中央书记处第一书记胡耀邦，在今天的大会上讲了话。
    在今天大会上发言的，还有西藏运输局拉萨汽车修配厂锻工达娃，沈阳东北机器制造厂家属委员会副主任高凤琴，青海省德令哈农场副场长郝丰堂，卫生部中医研究所医师李志明，甘肃兰州职工子弟小学教员李景兰，宁夏石炭井代开煤田建井公司采煤组长王进玉，北京电子管厂厂长周凤鸣。
    明天，大会将继续举行。
