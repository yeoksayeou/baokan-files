    The German Democratic Republic – A Bulwark of Peace and Socialism in Germany
    ——Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the German Democratic Republic
    Wilhelm Pieck, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, President of the German Democratic Republic

    Today, the people of the German Democratic Republic, together with the peace-loving and patriotic forces of West Germany, celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of their nation. The working people of the German Democratic Republic, filled with pride in the great achievements they have obtained through enthusiastic productive labor and scientific and cultural activities, celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of their nation together with the peace-loving and patriotic forces of West Germany, celebrating October 7, 1959.
    The German working class, under the leadership of its party, has established a bulwark of peace on a portion of German soil. The world-transforming ideas of the geniuses of scientific socialism, the experience of decades of struggle by the German and international proletariat, have become a reality in our country. Thus, the German Democratic Republic has become a shining example of a peaceful, happy, and prosperous nation for all Germans.
    Thanks to the wise and principled policies of the workers' party, the peace policy of our government, and the achievements of the working people, the German Democratic Republic enjoys a lofty prestige among peace-loving people throughout the world. The German Democratic Republic, together with all socialist countries, is advancing victoriously on the road to socialism-communism, contributing to the struggle to defend peace and to the peaceful competition with capitalist countries.
    The great socialist Soviet Union and all socialist countries have provided fraternal assistance to the construction of our peaceful nation. Therefore, on the tenth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, we express our heartfelt gratitude for the friendly support of the working people of the Communist Parties of various countries and of the fraternal socialist countries. The world-historic victory of the Soviet Union over Hitlerite fascism in May 1945 and the complete military defeat of German imperialism opened the path to a peaceful future for our people. It was necessary to settle the towering crimes committed by the fascists against the people of Europe, to settle accounts with the instigators of the two devastating world wars. It was necessary to clear away the spiritual and material ruins left by the fascists and to build a new life in the spirit of peace and understanding among nations. Leading the solution of these tasks were those Germans who had stood on the side of the peace-loving people of all countries to fight against Hitler, who had resisted the fascist barbarians together with the enslaved people of Europe in prisons and concentration camps, and who had proven their loyalty to socialist ideals and proletarian internationalism with the blood of their finest members.
    In its historic appeal of June 11, 1945 (which was endorsed by the Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party), the German Communist Party put forward a concrete program to overcome chaos, famine, and poverty, and for the democratic reconstruction of Germany. It demanded the complete political and economic deprivation of power of the German wreckers, the confiscation of all property of Nazi backbone elements and war criminals, and the transfer of their enterprises to public ownership, the elimination of the system of large landholdings and the distribution of the land of the Junker landlords, and the removal of all fascists from administrative organs, the economy, the judiciary, education, and cultural life. This program was in the interests of all peace-loving Germans. In the struggle to realize these demands, the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party consolidated the unity of action between the two parties, and all patriotic forces established cooperation in the anti-fascist and democratic alliance of parties.
    The workers of eastern Germany drew the correct conclusion: only united would they be strong enough to finally defeat the enemy.
    The merger of the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in April 1946 was an event of great national significance. This was a victory for Marxism-Leninism in the German workers' movement, laying the foundation for the development of a new type of unified Marxist-Leninist party in Germany. The working people of our country, united around the unified working class, set about realizing the tasks put forward in the German Communist Party's June appeal. These tasks were in line with the interests of peace-loving people of all countries and the demands of justice. They demanded guarantees to prevent German imperialism and militarism. In the area of today's German Democratic Republic, the working people, under the leadership of their unified party, through arduous class struggle, achieved the greatest revolution in German history. The initial administrative organs formed under the leadership of the working class already revealed the revolutionary essence of our new democratic regime.
    Under the leadership of representatives of the working class and other anti-fascist forces, new democratic self-governing organs were established in the townships, counties, and states, as well as new judicial and public security organs. Through democratic land reform, the land of the reactionary, militaristic Junker landlords was distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. The enterprises and economic power of the Konzern bosses and monopoly giants were deprived. In the June 1946 plebiscite in Saxony, three-quarters of the voters, through secret ballot, approved the confiscation of the property of war criminals and Nazi backbone elements, turning it into public property. A strong state-owned sector emerged in the economy. This struggle eliminated the socio-economic foundations of the imperialist big bourgeoisie and militarism, and of the large landowners.
    The democratic educational reform shattered the educational privileges of the wealthy. This reform, along with other measures aimed at eradicating the poison of fascism and militarism and educating the masses in a progressive and humanitarian spirit, became an important component of the democratic cultural revolution. During this period, an important task for consolidating the anti-fascist and democratic system was the creation of a new work ethic and the improvement of labor productivity. In the first stage of our revolutionary development, the anti-fascist and democratic revolution, significant changes in socio-economic relations and class forces were achieved on a peaceful path without civil war, utilizing parliamentary institutions. In the process of revolutionary change, the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship was established with the participation of other people's strata.
    Despite the painstaking efforts of the reactionaries, they have never been able to shatter the anti-fascist and democratic alliance in which all parties participated, or simply paralyze it. Under the leadership of the workers' party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—all democratic forces united and mobilized the people to carry out these enormous tasks. In this regard, they received the friendly support of the socialist Soviet Union.
    Just as a steadfast democratic development was being realized in eastern Germany, the imperialist countries, immediately after signing the Potsdam Agreement, began to pursue a policy in West Germany aimed at restoring the forces of German imperialism and militarism. They hindered the development of popular democratic forces and incited forces who wanted to restore the rule of monopoly capital and maintain a reactionary regime to unite.
    The aim of this policy was to develop western Germany into a reactionary bulwark against the democratic movement in Europe and a military base for attacking the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
    The collusion between the imperialist occupying powers and the German reactionaries to divide Germany and hinder democratic development once again showed that German imperialists, militarists, and Junker landlords were only interested in the nation, the fatherland—Germany—when their rule and maximum profits were guaranteed. These people once again chose the path of betrayal in 1945. They regarded relying on the United States imperialism as the only possibility to regain their old power and position. These forces, who had more than once brought war and destruction to the people of Europe, were once again preparing to exercise power and prepare for new wars in West Germany.
    This development ran counter to the will of the people of West Germany. Like the people of our republic, the people of West Germany also wanted to deprive the enemies of our people of their power and establish a peace-loving, democratic country after 1945. Regrettably, the right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party did not learn from the past. They once again embarked on the path of anti-communism and maintaining the division of the working class. In this regard, they were supported by the Western occupying powers. The Western occupying powers suppressed the massive movement of workers demanding unification. Using the alluring rhetoric of a so-called third way to socialism, the right-wing Social Democratic leaders hindered the establishment of the unity of the West German working class, incited the revival of German imperialism and militarism, and the reactionary, anti-national policy of dividing Germany. Through the establishment of the divided state of West Germany in September 1949, the monopoly capitalist-imperialist forces completed the division of Germany. They established the Bonn divided state in order to safeguard their class rule in West Germany and, from this base, attempted to restore the dictatorship of financial capital, monopoly capitalists, and militarists throughout Germany.
    The people of eastern Germany, united in the National Front of Democratic Germany, responded to the crimes of the imperialist divisionists by establishing the German Democratic Republic. The National Front of Democratic Germany arose from the massive People's Congress movement for unity and a just peace.
    The establishment of a worker-peasant regime in eastern Germany was the most severe blow suffered by predatory German imperialism and militarism after its devastating defeat in 1945. The founding of the German Democratic Republic was a turning point in the history of Germany and Europe.
    A peaceful country was born. Through this country, one-third of German territory was freed from the influence of German and foreign imperialists, blocking their path eastward.
    Thus, the cornerstone was laid for a future unified, peace-loving, and democratic German state. A new stage began in the German people's struggle to establish unity and conclude a peace treaty. As a bulwark of democracy and peace in Germany, the German Democratic Republic is the only legitimate German state, because for the first time in German history the principle of "all power emanates from the people" has been realized, and the working class, in alliance with the working peasants, intellectuals, and other working strata, exercises power. The German Democratic Republic is the legitimate German state because it represents the peaceful interests of our people and strives to restore German unity through the path of a confederation of the two Germanies. In our worker-peasant state, the immediate material rights of the working people, such as the right to work, the right to rest, and other basic rights, are guaranteed.
    With the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the working class assumed the main responsibility for the economic, political, and cultural development of the country. Previously, central power had been held by the Soviet Military Administration. The working class faced new problems. Correctly solving these problems was of decisive significance for the further development of Germany. Socialist components had already formed during the anti-fascist and democratic transformation. With the establishment of the worker-peasant state, it became necessary to transition to a socialist planned economy and develop the state-owned components of our economy into socialist components. This became even more urgent when the imperialist monopoly capital, starting from their Bonn state base, did everything possible to eliminate the fruits of the anti-fascist and democratic transformation. Only by transitioning to a socialist revolution could the fruits of the anti-fascist and democratic transformation be guaranteed, making the restoration of monopoly capital, Junker landlords, and militarists in the German Democratic Republic forever impossible. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working people achieved great successes in economic construction. Through the upsurge of activist movements and competition movements, and thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, our 1949-1950 two-year plan was completed ahead of schedule, industrial production exceeded pre-war levels, and the state-owned components in the economy were consolidated. This made it possible for our party to announce the guidelines for the first five-year plan for the further development of the national economy in July 1950. This five-year plan greatly accelerated the development of our economy, culture, and science.
    The rapid development of productive forces is of particular significance for our republic, because it must engage in economic competition with the imperialist system within the territory of a country that is open to the imperialist border.
    In this regard, it must be taken into account that, due to certain objective reasons, such as more severe war damage and economic imbalances caused by division, the lack of hard coal and heavy industry, the foundation of our republic is much more difficult than that of the western region, so that capitalism in West Germany has been able to achieve great advantages temporarily in some aspects. With enormous efforts and sacrifices, the working people of our country strive to increase production with their own strength, thereby safeguarding the sovereignty of our republic and the future of our nation.
    The liberation of all the creative forces of our people promoted a sharp increase in industrial and agricultural production. The state-owned components have become the dominant factor in the economy. In agriculture, the working peasants began to organize agricultural production cooperatives on a voluntary basis. The new attitude of the working people of our country towards labor is also reflected in the widespread activist movements, competition movements, and innovator movements. These achievements and the increasing awareness of the people of all strata made it possible for the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to make the historic resolution at its Second Party Congress in 1952 to systematically establish the foundations of socialism in the German Democratic Republic. This opened up a happy and beautiful prospect for all working people.
    The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union initiated a new stage in the international revolutionary movement and are of great significance for the policies of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Better application of the Leninist norms of inner-party life, closer relations between the party, state organs and the masses, and the fight against dogmatism—these are important lessons that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has learned from the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
    The German Democratic Republic is the westernmost part of the socialist camp, and it shares a border with capitalist West Germany and the imperialist sabotage center West Berlin. During this period, the imperialists attempted to intensify their sabotage from within and drag it into the sphere of influence of the Western European imperialist forces. These attempts were defeated due to the clear leadership of the workers' party, the strength and invincibility of the people's democratic system of the German Democratic Republic.
    All conspiracies to undermine our close unity with the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been resolutely repelled. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany organized a struggle against various revisionist theories. These theories aimed at weakening the party and eliminating the worker-peasant regime, the main tool of the working class in socialist construction. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany shattered all revisionist influences and phenomena that would hinder the speed of socialist development in the political and economic spheres. These struggles have united the working people more closely around the workers' party, consolidated the moral and political unity of our people, promoted a further upsurge in the spiritual and cultural life of the republic, and achieved new and outstanding production achievements. In this way, the German Democratic Republic has made a significant contribution to shattering the international reactionaries' widespread conspiracies to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, undermine the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the international workers' movement, and eliminate the people's democratic system in socialist countries. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany was consolidated and strengthened during this most severe period of class struggle, and it is more closely united under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism.
    In contrast to the peaceful development of our worker-peasant state, the imperialists rapidly revived German militarism in West Germany. West Germany was dragged into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, important figures of the fascist state were restored to honor, and were placed in leadership positions in the state, economy, and army.
    Compulsory military service was implemented in West Germany, and the West German mercenaries began atomic armament. The peace-loving and peace-supporting people of West Germany who opposed this destructive development were persecuted and suppressed. The German Communist Party—the only party in West Germany that represents the interests of the working class—was banned. Today, it is once again secretly waging an unwavering struggle against militarism and to defend peace. Bonn's main politicians openly admit that they regard the militarization and atomic armament of West Germany as a prerequisite for restoring their rule in the German Democratic Republic, the western regions of Poland, and parts of Czechoslovakia. Our continuous efforts to peacefully resolve the German question through negotiations have been rudely rejected by the Bonn government. These efforts are specifically manifested in the proposal to form a confederation of the two Germanies at the current stage. Whoever is unwilling to negotiate, but declares rearmament as the path to restoring German unity, is pursuing nothing more than war. Therefore, the Bonn government is so desperately opposed to easing international tensions and ending the "Cold War." Through provocative policies and the sabotage activities of the countless spy and special agent organizations it has incited against the German Democratic Republic and socialist countries, the Bonn government is attempting to ignite the flames of a "hot war." It is enough to point out here the role of West Berlin as a center of espionage and sabotage in the heart of the German Democratic Republic.
    The Adenauer government is the only government in Europe that has made territorial demands on other countries. Under its incitement and support, about one thousand two hundred fascist German Armed Forces traditional associations have been established in West Germany, including forty-five associations of bloodstained SS executioners and fifty former immigrant associations. The purpose of these associations is to conduct chauvinistic and revanchist provocations against the people of Eastern countries.
    The Bonn government feels it is once again powerful enough to reprimand the leaders of Western European countries if they support measures of international understanding. Fifteen years after the end of World War II, the West German imperialists have once again become the most dangerous and active instigators of war in Europe. Therefore, restraining German imperialism and militarism and establishing peace and democracy in West Germany is the main task of peacefully resolving the German question.
    The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in 1958, put forward a program to strive for peace, strive for the victory of socialism in a short historical period, and strive for the rejuvenation of the German nation to become a peace-loving and democratic country. This is possible because of the political, economic, and cultural achievements made during the period of establishing the foundations of socialism, and the friendly assistance and support given by the socialist countries. Our people's democratic regime has been further developed. In accordance with Lenin's instruction that the strength of a socialist country lies in its unbreakable close connection with the masses of the people, the working people are being increasingly absorbed into the leadership of the state and the economy. The people of all strata actively participate in organizing social life through the people's representative bodies at all levels, committees and leading cores, the National Front of Democratic Germany and its institutions in residential areas and streets, trade unions and their factory committees, production discussion meetings, socialist labor teams, and labor collectives. Under the leadership of the workers' party, the extensive development of socialist democracy has consolidated the people's democratic system of the German Democratic Republic.
    In 1958, the total industrial output of the German Democratic Republic increased by two times compared with 1949, labor productivity increased by one time, and the production of socialist enterprises accounted for 88.8% of industrial production. In terms of foreign trade, our country has established normal trade relations with more than one hundred countries. Due to this economic upsurge, the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic has accounted for the fifth place in Europe. In agriculture, significant progress has been made in the socialist transformation, and the working peasants have established more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives, which cultivate about 40% of the agricultural cultivated land area. If the cultivated land area of the state-owned farms is added, then more than 50% of the agricultural cultivated land area of the German Democratic Republic is socialist-operated. The voluntary organization of the vast number of working peasants has made it possible to widely utilize science and technology in agriculture, greatly increase labor productivity and the living standards of cooperative farmers. Agricultural production cooperatives play the greatest role in greatly increasing our agricultural production. The seven-year plan, approved in principle by the Fifth Party Congress, stipulates that by 1965, industrial production will be further increased by 88% compared with 1958, and agricultural production will be greatly increased. Labor productivity will increase by 85%. Real wages will increase by 60% to 65%, and preferential treatment will increase by 55%. Working hours will be further shortened. These are huge tasks. We firmly believe that we will solve these tasks. The resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany have aroused the tremendous creative enthusiasm of the working people, which has already enabled them to achieve significant successes in implementing this plan.
    The development speed of many sectors of our national economy currently exceeds the planned targets. The total industrial production growth rate in the first half of 1959 was 12%. It increased to 14% in the last two months. Labor productivity in socialist industry increased by 10.1% in the past eight months. On August 15, 81.3% of production workers participated in socialist competition, and 24.5% of all work teams in socialist industry participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."
    They are leading the struggle to overfulfill the plan. The working class has become the conscious builder of a new life. The most outstanding members among them—activists, labor heroes, and production innovators—are the vanguards in completing our socialist construction.
    In socialist construction, further consolidating the alliance formed by the working class and the working peasants and other working strata is of particular significance. We have also made great efforts to raise the ideological awareness of certain strata, who have formed a strong bourgeois ideology due to the habits of the petty bourgeoisie and the traditions of small-scale industrial production inherited for thousands of years. The most significant thing for the working class in establishing the foundations of socialism is the further development of its policy of alliance with the working peasants, which is manifested in helping individual working peasants to voluntarily organize agricultural production cooperatives. Intellectuals have also developed into a new stratum, and they are closely united with the working class and actively participate in socialist construction. They have obtained all possible conditions to engage in creative labor. For private owners of means of production, our party strives to peacefully resolve their existing contradictions with the working class.
    Through handicraft production cooperatives, through consignment contracts signed between state-owned commercial enterprises and private retailers, and through public-private joint ventures, these strata have a future in socialist society. Under the mobilization of the National Front of Democratic Germany and the various parties participating in the alliance, these people are also participating in the cause of rapidly completing our socialist construction.
    The creative actions of the working people show that the slogan of "working together, planning together, managing together" put forward by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the National Front of Democratic Germany has become the pointer in the thinking and action of our people, just as their ideological awareness has changed in the development process after 1945.
    In enterprises and institutions, in agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives, new relationships of comradely mutual assistance and cooperation have emerged between people. New attitudes of citizens towards labor and towards socialist property, a new national consciousness, and new moral and ethical principles have formed. The socialist revolution has made good progress in the ideological and cultural fields. Under the leadership of the struggle-tested Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the people of the German Democratic Republic are marching forward on the road to socialism with full of confidence in victory.
    The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and the completion of our great seven-year plan are of great national significance. The situation in Germany urgently requires resolving the fundamental contradiction between the atomic war policy of the imperialist countries in West Germany and the peaceful policy of the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic. Further strengthening the people's democratic regime and building socialism is the main prerequisite for the struggle to restore German unity and become a peaceful and democratic country. These are changing the balance of power in favor of peace and democracy, and are inspiring the working people of West Germany to fight against atomic armament and the clerical rule of militarism. While West Germany wants to complete atomic armament in 1961, we will prove more convincingly through the completion of our main economic task—catching up with and surpassing West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of important food and consumer goods by the working people—that our socialist social system is superior to the imperialist rule in West Germany. The German Democratic Republic will prove by realizing the seven-year plan that without monopoly capital and militarists, without border demands and revenge policies, the German people can also live in peace and prosperity.
    The German Democratic Republic, in the ten years since its founding, has won high respect and admiration from all over the world through its political and economic achievements and through its peace policy. It has become a solid component of the world socialist camp. It is fraternally united as an equal party with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Albanian People's Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic. Our common path to socialism, our common Marxist-Leninist worldview, the leadership of our countries by the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the common nature of our countries are the sources of our strength and the unity of our camp. A new type of relationship has formed between the socialist countries, which is a relationship of fraternal cooperation, friendly assistance, and joint efforts for peace and improving the lives of our peoples. The planned cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields has brought great benefits to all participating countries, especially the smaller countries. This cooperation shows the new things in the foreign policy of socialist countries and is a brilliant manifestation of the application of the principles of proletarian internationalism in the relations of socialist countries.
    The German Democratic Republic has particularly close relations with the Soviet Union in all aspects (the liberator who liberated our country from fascism and enslavement, the selfless helper in the construction of our worker-peasant state), and has unlimited gratitude towards it. After the end of the terrible war (which caused such serious sacrifices to the people of our two countries), the relations between the Soviet Union and the German people opened a new page. The friendship and closest cooperation with the Soviet Union, deeply imprinted in the hearts of our people, is the unchangeable principle of our policy. The friendship between all the German people and the first socialist country is a major contribution to ensuring peace in Europe and to the prosperity of our politics, economy, and culture. The German Democratic Republic has consistently attached particular importance to maintaining close and friendly cooperation with its close neighbors, the Czechoslovak Republic and the Polish People's Republic. These two countries have long been the open targets of the aggressive policy of German imperialism and militarism.
    These two countries were the first victims of the fascist war policy, and they paid the greatest sacrifices in the Second World War other than the Soviet Union. It is of particular significance that these countries maintain friendly relations with Germany, which is one of the prerequisites for maintaining peace in Europe. The German Democratic Republic has won the sympathy of the people of these countries by solemnly recognizing the Oder-Neisse River boundary as a peaceful boundary and by fighting against West German revenge attempts. Today, they are fighting against West German imperialism's atomic war policy together with our country.
    In addition, the German Democratic Republic also maintains friendly relations with all countries that wish to establish relations with us on an equal footing. This relationship is conducive to maintaining peace and understanding among the peoples of all countries. On the basis of peaceful coexistence, respect for sovereignty, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs, it is developing increasingly close cooperation with nationalist countries that oppose imperialism and with the people of all countries who are fighting for liberation from colonial enslavement. The international status of the German Democratic Republic has been consolidated.
    Despite the Bonn government's attempt to undermine it at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Western powers have also had to de facto recognize the German Democratic Republic. Without the cooperation of the worker-peasant state of the German Democratic Republic, the German question cannot be resolved. The national policy we have adopted to peacefully resolve the German question, which has received the full support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, is being increasingly implemented. The draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government, which has been supported by the people of all strata and parties in our country, has pointed out a realistic path to ensure peace and restore the unification of the two Germanies for all countries concerned with concluding a peace treaty.
    More and more Germans are beginning to understand that concluding a peace treaty, restraining German militarism, and forming a confederation of the two Germanies are the only ways to revive Germany as a peaceful and democratic country under the existing conditions. The advocates of the "Cold War" have fallen into a dead end in Germany. The policy of consultation and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is increasingly popular among the German people. Especially when Comrade Khrushchev made a successful visit to the United States, the "Cold War knights" of Bonn and their hired literati are increasingly desperately defending their outdated position. The people of the German Democratic Republic and the millions of people in West Germany correctly regard this visit as a hopeful beginning of a new era in the relations between the socialist and capitalist camps, as the beginning of a stage of consultation and guaranteed peace. Through the world-historical proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by Comrade Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet government has once again pointed out a path to lasting peace and unprecedented prosperity for mankind. This proposal is in line with the demands and hopes of all peace-loving people. We believe that the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for understanding and disarmament have brought mankind a big step closer to peace. The people of the German Democratic Republic support this policy, which has opened up a bright prospect for mankind, and will dedicate all their strength to peace, to international disarmament, and to achieving victory in the peaceful competition with the capitalist system.
    The ten years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic have been ten years of tireless and fruitful struggle for the happiness and prosperity of the people, for maintaining peace, and for building a peaceful and democratic Germany. Through the common hard work of all the working people and the cooperation of all the socialist countries over the past ten years, we have created the conditions for greater achievements. The working people are implementing the tasks of the seven-year plan with joy and are beginning to comprehensively unfold our socialist construction. This is a great plan to ensure peace, complete our main economic tasks, and achieve socialist victory. The unity of our people in the National Front of Democratic Germany under the tested leadership of the workers' party, and the friendly support of the socialist brother countries, give us the confidence that we will certainly achieve our lofty goals. The German Democratic Republic will open up a path to a bright future for all the German people. The existence and prosperity of the German Democratic Republic guarantees to the people of Europe that peace will triumph in Germany.

    德意志民主共和国——德国和平和社会主义的堡垒
    ——庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十周年
    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员德意志民主共和国总统
    威廉·皮克
    今天，德意志民主共和国人民，同西德爱好和平和爱国的力量一起，庆祝他们国家成立的十周年。德意志民主共和国劳动人民怀着对他们通过欢欣鼓舞的生产劳动和科学文化活动而获得的伟大成果的自豪心情，同西德爱好和平和爱国的力量一起，庆祝他们国家成立的十周年，庆祝1959年10月7日。
    德国工人阶级在它的政党的领导下，在德国的一部分土地上建立了和平的堡垒。科学社会主义天才的奠基者改变世界的思想、德国和国际无产阶级数十年斗争的经验，在我国已经变成了现实。这样，德意志民主共和国就成为一个和平和所有德国人幸福和富裕的国家的光辉榜样了。
    由于工人阶级政党英明的和忠于原则的政策，由于我国政府的和平政策和劳动人民的成就，德意志民主共和国在全世界爱好和平的人民中享有崇高的威望。德意志民主共和国和所有社会主义国家一起，在通向社会主义—共产主义的道路上胜利前进，在保卫和平的斗争中，在同资本主义国家进行的和平竞赛中作出自己的贡献。
    伟大的社会主义苏联和所有社会主义国家，对我们和平的国家的建设给予了兄弟般的援助。因此，在德意志民主共和国十周年的时候，我们衷心地感谢各国共产党和社会主义兄弟国家的劳动人民的友好支持。1945年5月，苏联战胜希特勒法西斯的世界历史性的胜利和德国帝国主义在军事上的全面失败，给我国人民打开了通向和平未来的道路。必须清算法西斯分子对欧洲各国人民的滔天罪行，清算两次毁灭性的世界大战的发起者。必须清除法西斯分子留下的精神上和物质上的废墟，并本着和平和各国人民谅解的精神建设新生活。领导解决这些任务的是这样的一些德国人，他们曾站在爱好和平的各国人民一边向希特勒进行斗争，他们曾和欧洲各国受奴役者在监狱和集中营里共同抵抗法西斯野蛮人，他们曾用他们最优秀分子的鲜血来证明他们对社会主义理想、对无产阶级国际主义的忠诚。
    德国共产党在1945年6月11日的历史性号召（这个号召得到德国社会民主党中央委员会的赞同）中，提出了克服混乱、饥馑和贫困以及德国民主的新建的具体纲领。它要求从政治上和经济上完全剥夺德国破坏者的权力，没收纳粹骨干分子和战犯的全部财产，并把他们的企业转为全民所有，清除大地产占有制度和分配容克地主的土地，并把所有法西斯分子从行政机关、经济、司法、教育事业和文化生活中清除出去。这个纲领是符合所有爱好和平的德国人的利益的。在争取实现这些要求的斗争中，德国共产党和德国社会民主党巩固了两党行动的一致，所有爱国力量在反法西斯和民主政党联盟中建立了合作。
    德国东部的工人作出了正确的结论：只有团结起来，他们才强大得足以最后地战胜敌人。
    1946年4月，德国共产党和德国社会民主党合并成为德国统一社会党，这是具有重大民族意义的事件。这是马克思列宁主义在德国工人运动中的胜利，它为在德国发展一个新型的统一的马克思列宁主义政党奠定了基础。我国劳动人民团结在统一的工人阶级的周围，着手去实现德国共产党6月号召所提出的任务。这些任务符合爱好和平的各国人民的利益和正义的要求。他们要求取得防止德国帝国主义和军国主义的保证。在德意志民主共和国今天的地区，劳动人民在他们统一的政党的领导下，通过艰巨的阶级斗争，实现了德国历史上的最大的一次革命。在工人阶级领导下组成的最初的行政机关，就已显露了我们新的民主政权的革命本质。
    在工人阶级的代表和其他反法西斯力量的领导下，各乡、县和州新建了民主自治机关，并新建了司法机关和公安机关。通过民主土地改革，把反动的、军国主义的容克地主的土地分配给了无地和少地的农民。康采恩老板和垄断巨头的企业和经济权力受到了剥夺。在1946年6月萨克森人民的公决中，四分之三的选民通过秘密投票方式，赞成剥夺战犯和纳粹骨干分子的财产，把它变成全民所有。在经济中出现了强大的国营成分。这一斗争消灭了帝国主义大资产阶级和军国主义、大地主的社会经济基础。
    民主教育改革粉碎了有钱人的教育特权。这一改革同其他旨在根除法西斯主义和军国主义流毒、用进步的和人道主义的精神教育群众的措施一起，成为民主文化革命的重要组成部分。在这个时期内，巩固反法西斯和民主制度的一个重要任务就是：创立新的劳动道德和提高劳动生产率。在我们的革命发展的第一个阶段，即反法西斯和民主革命中，在没有内战的和平道路上，利用议会机构对社会经济关系和阶级力量实现了重大的变化。在革命变革过程中，建立了有其他人民阶层参加的工农民主专政。
    尽管反动派费尽心机，但从来没有能够粉碎所有党派都参加的反法西斯和民主联盟，或者只是使它陷于瘫痪。在工人阶级政党——德国统一社会党的领导下，所有民主力量都一致起来，动员人民执行这些巨大的任务。在这方面，他们得到社会主义苏联的友好支持。
    正当德国东部实现坚持不渝的民主发展的时候，帝国主义国家在签订波茨坦协定后，立即就在西德开始推行一种旨在恢复德国帝国主义和军国主义势力的政策。他们阻挠人民民主力量的发展，并怂恿那些想要恢复垄断资本统治和保持反动政权的势力联合起来。
    这种政策的目的是把德国的西部发展成为一个对付欧洲民主运动的反动堡垒和进攻苏联及其他社会主义国家的军事基地。
    帝国主义占领国和德国反动派勾结在一起，分裂德国和阻挠民主发展，这再一次表明德国帝国主义者、军国主义者和容克地主只有在他们的统治和最大利润得到保障的时候，才对民族、祖国——德国感到兴趣。这些人在1945年又选择了叛国的道路。他们把仰仗美国帝国主义鼻息看作是夺回他们的旧的势力和地位的唯一可能。过去曾不止一次地给欧洲各国人民带来战争和破坏的这些势力，在西德重又准备行使政权和准备新的战争。
    这种发展是和西德人民的意志背道而驰的。西德人民和我们共和国的人民一样，在1945年后，也想剥夺我国人民公敌的权力和建立一个爱好和平的民主的国家。遗憾的是，西德社会民主党右翼领袖没有从过去吸取教训。他们又走上了反共和保持工人阶级分裂的道路。在这方面，他们受到西方占领国的支持。西方占领国镇压了工人要求统一的声势浩大的运动。右翼社会民主党领袖用所谓走向社会主义的第三条路的笼络人心的言论，阻挠西德工人阶级统一的建立，怂恿复活德国帝国主义和军国主义，以及分裂德国的反动的反民族的政策。通过1949年9月西德分裂的国家的成立，垄断资本主义—帝国主义势力完成了德国的分裂。他们建立了波恩分裂的国家，为的是保障他们在西德的阶级统治，并从这个基础出发，力图在整个德国恢复金融资本、垄断资本家和军国主义者的独裁政权。
    德国东部人民团结在民主德国全国阵线中，用成立德意志民主共和国来回答帝国主义分裂主义者的罪行。民主德国全国阵线是从声势浩大的争取统一和公正和平的人民代表大会运动中产生的。
    在德国东部建立工农政权，是掠夺成性的德国帝国主义和军国主义在1945年的毁灭性失败后所受到的最沉重的打击。德意志民主共和国的成立是德国和欧洲历史的转折点。
    一个和平的国家诞生了。通过这个国家，德国有三分之一的土地摆脱了德国和外国帝国主义者的影响，堵塞了他们东进的道路。
    这样就为一个未来的统一、爱好和平和民主的德意志国家奠下了基石。德国人民争取建立统一和缔结和约的斗争开始了一个新的阶段。作为德国民主和和平的堡垒，德意志民主共和国是唯一合法的德意志国家，因为在德国历史上第一次实现了“一切政权从人民出发”的原则，工人阶级同劳动农民、知识分子和其他劳动阶层结成联盟，行使着政权。德意志民主共和国是合法的德意志国家，因为它代表着我国人民的和平利益，并努力争取通过两个德国成立邦联的道路恢复德国的统一。在我们的工农国家中，劳动人民的切身的物质权利，如劳动权、休息权和其他基本权利得到了保障。
    随着德意志民主共和国的成立，工人阶级对国家的经济、政治和文化发展承担了主要的责任。在这以前，中央政权还是由苏联军管会掌握的。工人阶级面临着新的问题。正确地解决这些问题，对德国的进一步发展具有决定性的意义。在反法西斯和民主变革期间就已形成了社会主义成分。随着工农国家的成立，向社会主义计划经济过渡和把我国经济的国营成分发展成为社会主义成分就成为必要的了。当帝国主义垄断资本从他们的波恩国家基地出发，竭尽全力想要消灭反法西斯和民主变革的成果的时候，这就显得更为迫切了。只有向社会主义革命过渡，反法西斯和民主变革的成果才能得到保障，才使得垄断资本、容克地主和军国主义者在德意志民主共和国复辟永远不可能。劳动人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，在经济建设中取得了巨大的成就。通过积极分子运动和竞赛运动的高涨，由于苏联和各人民民主国家的援助，我们的1949—1950年两年计划提前实现了，工业生产超过了战前水平，经济中的国营成分得到了巩固。这就使我们的党有可能在1950年7月宣布关于进一步发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的方针。这个五年计划使我们的经济、文化和科学的发展速度大大加快。
    迅速发展生产力对我们的共和国具有特殊的意义，因为它必须在一个国家的领土上对帝国主义边界开放的情况下，同帝国主义制度展开经济竞赛。
    在这方面必须考虑到，由于某些客观的原因，例如较严重的战争破坏和由于分裂而造成的经济不平衡，缺乏硬煤和重工业，我们共和国的基础比西部地区要困难得多，以致西德的资本主义在某些方面暂时能够取得很大的优势。我国劳动人民以巨大的努力和牺牲争取用自己的力量来提高生产，从而保障我们共和国的主权和我们民族的未来。
    我国人民的一切创造性力量的解放，促使工业和农业生产急剧增长。国营成分在经济中已成了占统治地位的因素。在农业中，劳动农民开始在自愿的基础上组织农业生产合作社。我国劳动人民对劳动采取了新的态度，这也表现在广泛开展的积极分子运动、竞赛运动和革新者运动上。这些成就和各阶层人民日益提高的觉悟，使德国统一社会党有可能在1952年第二次党代表会议上作出了在德意志民主共和国有计划地建立社会主义基础的历史性决议。这就给所有劳动人民打开了幸福的美好的远景。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，开始了国际革命运动中的新阶段，并且对于德国统一社会党的政策具有重大的意义。更好地运用党内生活的列宁准则，使党、国家机关和群众之间的关系更加密切，向教条主义进行斗争，——这是德国统一社会党从苏共第二十次代表大会中吸取的重要教训。
    德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营最西的部分，它同资本主义西德和帝国主义的破坏中心西柏林有着共同的边界。在这个时期，帝国主义者企图加紧从内部对它进行破坏，并把它拉入西欧帝国主义势力范围。这些企图由于工人阶级政党的目标明确的领导、德意志民主共和国人民民主制度的强大和不可动摇而遭到了失败。
    一切破坏我们同苏联和苏联共产党的紧密团结的阴谋，都被坚决地击退了。德国统一社会党组织了反对各种修正主义理论的斗争。这些理论的目的在于削弱党和消灭工人阶级在社会主义建设中的主要工具——工农政权。德国统一社会党粉碎了在政治和经济方面会阻碍社会主义发展速度的一切修正主义的影响和现象。这些斗争使劳动人民更紧密地团结在工人阶级政党的周围，巩固了我国人民的道义上和政治上的一致，促使共和国精神和文化生活的进一步高涨，取得了新的卓越的生产成就。这样，德意志民主共和国就为粉碎国际反动派破坏社会主义阵营的团结、破坏苏联共产党在国际工人运动中的领导作用和消灭社会主义国家的人民民主制度的广泛的阴谋，作出了重大的贡献。德国统一社会党在这个最严酷的阶级斗争时期获得了巩固和增强，它更紧紧地团结在不可战胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜之下了。
    与我们工农国家的和平发展相反，帝国主义者在德国西部迅速地复活了德国军国主义。西德被拉入侵略性的北大西洋公约，法西斯国家的重要人物恢复了名誉，并且被安插在国家、经济和军队的领导岗位上。
    西德实行了义务兵役制，西德雇佣军开始了原子武装。反对这种毁灭性发展、热爱和平和拥护和平的西德人民受到迫害和镇压。德国共产党——西德唯一代表工人阶级利益的政党被禁止了。今天它重又秘密地展开反对军国主义和保卫和平的坚定不移的斗争。波恩的主要政客公开地承认，他们把西德军国主义化和原子武装看作是在德意志民主共和国、波兰西部地区和捷克斯洛伐克的部分地区恢复他们统治的前提。我们的通过谈判和平解决德国问题的不断努力，一直被波恩政府粗暴地拒绝了。这些努力在目前阶段具体表现在两个德国组成邦联的建议上。谁要是不愿谈判，而宣布重新武装为恢复德国统一的道路，那么他所追求的不过是战争而已。因此，波恩政府也就如此拼命地反对缓和国际紧张局势和结束“冷战”。波恩政府通过挑衅性的政策和它所怂恿的无数间谍和特务组织反对德意志民主共和国和社会主义国家的破坏活动，企图燃起“热战”的火焰。这里只要指出作为在德意志民主共和国心脏的间谍和破坏中心的西柏林的作用就够了。
    阿登纳政府是欧洲唯一向其他国家提出领土要求的政府。在它的怂恿和扶植下，在西德成立了约一千二百个法西斯主义国防军传统协会，其中有四十五个双手沾满鲜血的党卫军刽子手的协会和五十个前移民者协会。这些协会的目的就是要向东方各国人民进行沙文主义和复仇主义的挑衅。
    波恩政府觉得自己重又强大到足以训斥西欧国家领导人的地步了，如果他们拥护国际谅解的措施的话。第二次世界大战结束十五年后，西德帝国主义者在欧洲又成了最危险和最积极的战争挑衅者。因此，约束德国帝国主义和军国主义、在西德建立和平和民主，是和平解决德国问题的主要任务。
    德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，在1958年提出了争取和平、争取社会主义在短短的历史时期内取得胜利、争取德国民族复兴成为爱好和平和民主国家的纲领。这之所以可能，是由于在建立社会主义基础的时期取得了政治、经济和文化的成就以及各社会主义国家给予了友好的援助和支持。我国人民民主政权已进一步发展了。根据列宁的指示，即社会主义国家的强大在于和人民群众的不可分割的紧密联系，劳动人民愈来愈多地被吸收参加国家和经济的领导。各阶层人民通过各级人民代表机构、委员会和领导核心、民主德国全国阵线和它在住宅区和街道的机构、工会和它的工厂委员会、生产讨论会、社会主义劳动队和劳动集体，积极地参加组织社会生活。在工人阶级政党的领导下，广泛地发展社会主义民主，巩固了德意志民主共和国的人民民主制度。
    1958年德意志民主共和国的工业总产量比1949年增加了两倍，劳动生产率增加了一倍，社会主义企业的生产占工业生产的88.8％。在对外贸易方面，我国已和一百多个国家建立了正常的贸易关系。由于这种的经济高涨，德意志民主共和国的工业产量已占欧洲第五位。在农业方面，社会主义改造取得了重大的进展，劳动农民建立了一万多个农业生产合作社，这些合作社耕种着约40％的农业耕地面积。如果再加上国营农场的耕地面积，那么德意志民主共和国农业耕地面积有50％以上是社会主义经营的。广大的劳动农民自愿组织起来，就有可能在农业中广泛地利用科学技术，大大地提高劳动生产率和合作社农民的生活水平。农业生产合作社对大大提高我国农业生产起着最大的作用。第五次党代表大会原则上通过的七年计划规定，到1965年使工业生产比1958年进一步提高88％，并大大增加农业生产。劳动生产率将提高85％。实际工资将提高60％到65％，优抚金将提高55％。工作时间将进一步缩短。这些都是巨大的任务。我们坚信，我们一定会解决这些任务。德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的决议，唤起了劳动人民的巨大的创造积极性，这种积极性已经使得他们在执行这个计划时取得了重大的成就。
    我国国民经济许多部门的发展速度目前已超过计划指标。1959年上半年工业总生产增长率是12％。在最后两个月增加到14％。社会主义工业的劳动生产率在过去八个月中提高了10.1％。8月15日，81.3％的生产工人参加了社会主义竞赛，社会主义工业中所有的工作队，有24.5％参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。
    他们领导着争取超额完成计划的斗争。工人阶级成为新生活的自觉的建设者。他们当中最优秀的分子——积极分子、劳动英雄和生产革新者——是完成我国社会主义建设的尖兵。
    在社会主义建设中，进一步巩固工人阶级和劳动农民及其他劳动阶层所结成的联盟有着特别的意义。我们也作了很大的努力，提高某些阶层的思想觉悟，这些阶层由于小资产阶级的习惯和数千年来因袭的工业小生产的传统而形成了浓厚的资产阶级思想。工人阶级在建立社会主义基础时意义最为重大的，是它和劳动农民联盟政策的进一步发展，这表现在帮助个体劳动农民自愿组织农业生产合作社这一点上。知识分子同样也发展成为一个新的阶层，他们和工人阶级紧密地团结在一起，积极参加社会主义建设。他们获得了从事创造性劳动的一切可能的条件。对生产资料私有者，我们的党努力用和平的方式解决他们同工人阶级的现有矛盾。
    通过手工业生产合作社、通过国营商业与私营零售商签订代销合同以及通过公私合营，这就使这些阶层在社会主义社会中有了前途。在民主德国全国阵线和参加联盟的各政党的动员下，这些人也参加了迅速完成我国社会主义建设的事业。
    劳动人民的创造性行动，显示了德国统一社会党和民主德国全国阵线所提出的“共同劳动、共同计划、共同管理”的口号，已成为我国人民思想上和行动上的指针，如同他们的思想觉悟在1945年后的发展过程中有了变化一样。
    在企业和机关中，在农业生产合作社和手工业生产合作社中，出现了人与人之间同志式的互助合作的新关系。公民们对待劳动和对待社会主义财产的新态度、新的国家意识、新的道德和伦理原则形成了。社会主义革命在思想和文化领域取得了良好的进展。德意志民主共和国人民在经过斗争考验的德国统一社会党的领导下，充满着必胜的信心，在通向社会主义的道路上迈进。
    德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设和我国伟大的七年计划的完成，有着伟大的民族意义。德国的状况迫切要求解决西德帝国主义国家发动原子战争政策与德意志民主共和国工农政权和平政策之间的根本矛盾。进一步增强人民民主政权和建设社会主义，是争取恢复德国统一成为和平和民主国家斗争的主要前提。这些正在使力量对比发生有利于和平和民主的变化，并鼓舞西德劳动人民向原子武装和军国主义教权统治进行斗争。西德想要在1961年完成原子武装，而我们将通过完成我国主要经济任务——在劳动人民对重要的食品和消费品的消费量方面按人口计算赶上并超过西德——更有说服力地证明，我们的社会主义社会制度比西德帝国主义统治优越。德意志民主共和国将要以实现七年计划来证明，没有垄断资本和军国主义者，没有边界要求和复仇政策，德国人民也能生活在和平和繁荣之中。
    德意志民主共和国成立十年来，通过它在政治上和经济上的成就，通过它的和平政策，赢得了全世界的高度尊敬和钦佩。它已成为世界社会主义阵营的一个牢固的组成部分。它作为平等的一方，和苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、波兰人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国兄弟般的团结在一起。我们走向社会主义的共同道路、我们的共同的马克思列宁主义世界观、我们各国共产党和工人党对我们国家的领导和我们各国的共同性质，是我们的力量和我们阵营的团结的源泉。在各社会主义国家之间形成了新型的关系，这就是兄弟般的合作、友好援助和为和平和改善我们各国人民生活而共同努力的关系。在政治、经济和文化方面的有计划的合作，给所有参加国、特别是较小的国家带来了很大的好处。这种合作表现了社会主义国家外交政策中的新东西，是无产阶级国际主义原则在社会主义国家关系中运用的光辉表现。
    德意志民主共和国在各方面和苏联（把我国从法西斯主义和奴役下解放出来的解放者，我们工农国家的建设的无私援助者）有着特别紧密的关系，并对它怀有无限的谢意。在可怕的战争结束以后（这次战争使我们两国人民遭受了如此严重的牺牲），苏联和德国人民的关系就揭开了新的一页。深深印在我国人民心中的同苏联的友谊和最密切的合作，是我国政策不可改变的原则。全德国人民和第一个社会主义国家的友谊，是对保障欧洲和平和繁荣我国政治、经济和文化的重大贡献。德意志民主共和国一贯特别重视和它的近邻捷克斯洛伐克共和国和波兰人民共和国保持着紧密友好的合作。这两个国家曾长时期是德国帝国主义和军国主义的侵略政策的公开目标。
    这两个国家都是法西斯战争政策的第一批受害者，它们在第二次世界大战中付出了除苏联以外的最大的牺牲。这些国家和德国保持着友好关系是有着特别意义的，这是维护欧洲和平的先决条件之一。德意志民主共和国通过庄严地承认奥得—尼斯河边界为和平疆界，通过反对西德复仇企图的斗争，赢得了这些国家人民的同情。今天他们和我国一起，共同对西德帝国主义的原子战争政策进行斗争。
    此外，德意志民主共和国还和所有希望在平等基础上和我们建立关系的国家保持着友好的关系。这种关系是有利于维护和平和各国人民谅解的。在和平共处、尊重主权、平等和互不干涉内政的基础上，它和反对帝国主义的民族主义国家、为争取从殖民奴役下解放出来而斗争的各国人民发展着越来越密切的合作。德意志民主共和国的国际地位得到了巩固。
    尽管波恩政府在日内瓦外长会议上企图破坏，西方大国也不得不在事实上承认了德意志民主共和国。没有德意志民主共和国工农国家的合作，德国问题就不能解决。我们所采取的和平解决德国问题的民族政策，受到了苏联和其他社会主义国家的全力支持，正在日益得到贯彻。苏联政府提出的对德和约草案，受到了我国各阶层人民和各党派的支持，给所有关心缔结和约的国家指出了一条确保和平和使两个德国恢复统一的现实道路。
    越来越多的德国人开始理解到，缔结和约、约制德国军国主义和两个德国组成邦联，是在现有的条件下使德国复兴为和平民主国家的唯一道路。“冷战”的拥护者在德国已陷入了死胡同。具有不同社会制度的国家协商和和平共处的政策，在德国人民中越来越得到欢迎。特别是当赫鲁晓夫同志在美国进行成功的访问的时候，波恩的“冷战骑士”及其雇佣文人，越来越拼命保卫他们的过时的地位。德意志民主共和国的人民和西德的千百万人民，把这一次访问很正确地看作是社会主义和资本主义阵营关系中的一个新纪元的充满希望的开始，当作是协商和有保障的和平的阶段的开始。通过赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国大会上提出的全面和彻底裁军的世界历史性的建议，苏联政府又一次给人类指出了一条持久和平和前所未有的繁荣的道路。这一建议符合所有爱好和平的人民的要求与希望。我们相信，苏联争取谅解和裁军的努力，使人类又向和平靠近了一大步。德意志民主共和国人民支持这一个给人类开辟了幸福远景的政策，并为和平，为国际裁军，为在与资本主义体系的和平竞赛中取得胜利而献出全部力量。
    德意志民主共和国成立以来的十年，是为人民的幸福和富裕，为维护和平和建设和平民主的德国而进行孜孜不倦的和卓著成效的斗争的十年。通过十年来全体劳动人民的共同的辛勤劳动和所有社会主义国家的合作，我们为取得更大的成就创造了条件。劳动人民怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情去实现七年计划的任务，开始全面展开我国社会主义建设。这是一个保障和平、完成我们的主要经济任务和社会主义胜利的伟大计划。我国人民在工人阶级政党经过考验的领导下的民主德国全国阵线中的团结一致，以及社会主义兄弟国家的友好支持，使我们确信，我们一定会达到我们的崇高的目标。德意志民主共和国将为全德人民开辟一条通向光明未来的道路。德意志民主共和国的存在和繁荣，向欧洲各国人民保证，和平将在德国取得胜利。
