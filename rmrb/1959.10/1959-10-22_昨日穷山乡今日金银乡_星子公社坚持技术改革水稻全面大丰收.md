    Yesterday a Poor Mountain Village, Today a Golden Silver Village
    Xingzi Commune Persists in Technical Reform, Achieving an All-Round Bumper Harvest of Rice
    The Xingzi People's Commune in the northern Guangdong deep mountain valley of the Lianyang Autonomous County, traditionally a poor area, has achieved consecutive bumper harvests of early rice and mid-season rice this year, and autumn crops are also growing very well.
    The Xingzi People's Commune has always been considered a poor and remote area with high mountains, cold water, sparse population, and abundant land, but this year it became famous throughout the province for its extraordinary leap forward in early rice production. The commune's more than 31,000 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 522 jin per mu, an increase of more than 25% compared to the same period last year; the total output increased by more than 39% compared to the same period last year. The commune's more than 41,000 mu of mid-season rice achieved an average yield of 535 jin per mu, an increase of more than 25% compared to the same period last year.
    Due to the bumper harvest, the Xingzi Commune delivered public grain and sold surplus grain of 100,000 dan this summer, providing the state with more than 25,000 dan of commercial grain than the entire year of last year. It is estimated that autumn crops will also average around 500 jin per mu. It is projected that the annual grain harvest (including miscellaneous grains) will reach about 900 jin per person, calculated by population.
    The large increase in rice production in the Xingzi People's Commune this year is the result of having the People's Commune, the continuous struggle against right-leaning thoughts, and the implementation of agricultural technical reform measures such as reasonable close planting. During the early rice transplanting, the commune's Party committee organized a mass debate, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively responded to the Party's call for reasonable close planting, eliminating the danger of regression in agricultural technical reforms. In implementing increased production measures such as rational fertilization, rational irrigation, and strengthening field management, they resolutely implemented the instructions of the higher Party committee, just like reasonable close planting, ensuring that all technical reforms were adhered to. Without such resolute technical reform, the Xingzi People's Commune's bumper harvest of grain would not have been possible.

    昨日穷山乡今日金银乡
    星子公社坚持技术改革水稻全面大丰收
    广东北部深山穷谷中的连阳各族自治县星子人民公社，今年早稻、中造水稻连续获得特大丰收，秋季作物也长得很好。
    星子人民公社向来被认为是山高水冷、地多人少的穷乡僻壤，今年却因早稻特大跃进而名闻全省。全社三万一千多亩早稻，平均亩产达到五百二十二斤，比去年同期增长25％强；总产量比去年同期增长39％强。全社四万一千多亩中稻，平均亩产达到五百三十五斤，比去年同期增产25％强。
    由于丰收，星子公社夏季交公粮、卖余粮十万担，比去年全年为国家多提供了二万五千多担商品粮。秋季作物估计平均每亩也在五百斤左右。预计全年粮食收成（连杂粮在内）按人口计算，每人将达九百斤左右。
    星子人民公社今年水稻增产幅度大，是由于有了人民公社，由于不断与右倾思想作斗争，以及实施合理密植等农业技术改革措施的结果。早稻插秧时，公社党委组织了全民性大辩论，广大贫农和下中农积极地响应党的合理密植的号召，消除了农业技术改革倒退的危险。在贯彻合理施肥、合理灌溉、加强田间管理等等增产措施方面，也都像合理密植一样，坚决执行了上级党委指示，使技术改革全部坚持下来。没有这么坚决地技术改革，星子公社粮食大丰收是不可能的。
