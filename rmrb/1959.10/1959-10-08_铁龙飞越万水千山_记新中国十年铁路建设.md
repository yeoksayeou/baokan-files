    Iron Dragons Fly Over Mountains and Rivers
    ——A Record of Railway Construction in New China over Ten Years
    By Our Correspondent Shao Tingjun
    Displayed before me are two leaf-shaped maps: one is a withered leaf—only the eastern and northeastern parts have some fragmented veins, the rest is blank; the other is a robust leaf—not only are the veins of the eastern and northeastern parts lush, but many new main and branch veins extend to the southwest and northwest, appearing to be well-connected in all directions.
    The former is a railway map of old China, and the latter is a railway map of new China. From the stark contrast between these two maps, we can clearly see how encouragingly and rapidly railway construction in new China has developed.
    In old China, from the Qing Dynasty emperors and the Northern Warlords to Chiang Kai-shek, it took seventy-three years (1876-1948) to build a total of over 20,000 kilometers of railways. However, by the time of national liberation, due to the destruction of war, only a little over 11,000 kilometers were barely passable. The distribution of these railways was deformed, mostly concentrated in the Northeast and coastal areas. These railways, built by imperialists in collusion with Chinese landlords, bureaucrats, and comprador bourgeoisie to plunder China's resources, were like blood-sucking tubes crawling on the people, endlessly draining China's wealth.
    However, what tremendous and profound changes have taken place in railway construction in the short ten years since liberation! From the day the railways were grasped by the people, they became a spirited steed, full of vitality, galloping across the vast fields of the motherland!
    In the past decade, we have not only repaired and renovated the railways destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also built more than 7,500 kilometers of new railway trunk and branch lines (excluding enterprise-dedicated lines) in the nine years from 1950 to 1958, and built and repaired more than 2,800 kilometers of double-track lines, and repaired more than 1,700 kilometers of trunk and branch lines. By the end of 1958, the total mileage of railways open to traffic nationwide had reached more than 31,000 kilometers, an increase of about 39% compared to 1950.
    According to the railway mileage built in the ten years of new China, we built an average of more than 1,300 kilometers per year, which is more than three times the annual average for the seventy-three years before liberation. Especially since 1958, railway construction has seen a vigorous and high-speed development due to the large-scale mass movement. Last year and this year alone, we have built and plan to build more than 5,000 kilometers of new lines and double tracks, averaging more than 2,500 kilometers per year. In the more than 20 years of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, only 2,600 kilometers were built throughout the country.
    Everyone knows that old China was virtually "a blank sheet of paper" in terms of railway construction. It was precisely because they saw this that the imperialists ridiculed us at the beginning of liberation, saying: The Chinese Communist Party has no experience, no technical personnel, and no railway equipment. To build railways and bridges is a dream! However, can "a blank sheet of paper" stump us? Can the ridicule of imperialism scare us? No. As early as 1950, when we started to restore the economy, we began to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in Sichuan. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, we explored design and construction on our own. In just over two years, we completed the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the reactionary rulers had clamored for forty years without ever building.
    After the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, we immediately built the Jining-Erlian line to the Mongolian People's Republic, the Litang-Zhanjiang line in Guangxi connecting to the southern trading port of Zhanjiang, the Lancun-Yantai line to the important port of Yantai in Shandong Peninsula, the Fengtai-Shacheng line to improve the throughput capacity of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, the Laibin-Munanguan line to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Tianshui-Lanzhou line in Gansu, the Duyun-Guiyang section connecting the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, and the eastern section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, another international trunk line leading to the Soviet Union. The successive completion of these railways has fundamentally changed the deformed state of railway distribution in our country. The newly built railways, like iron dragons galloping across mountains and rivers, have extended to all provinces and regions of our country except Tibet. Today, taking a train from Xinjiang in the motherland, it only takes dozens of hours to reach the coast of the East China Sea. From Manzhouli in the northeast of the motherland, you can take a train all the way to Munanguan on the southern edge of the motherland. The people in the vast mountainous and remote areas can take comfortable trains, cross high mountains and deep valleys, pass through high plateaus with thin air, or cross sparsely populated deserts and endless grasslands, and go directly to the capital of the motherland—Beijing.
    Now, when we see that the oil and fur from the Northwest, the grain, local specialties and non-ferrous metals from the Southwest, the timber from the Southeast and Northeast, and the coal from the North can all be supplied to the development needs of the country's industry and agriculture through railways, we cannot help but recall how our railway construction workers have endured hardships and overcome towering mountains and turbulent rivers to build these railways over the past ten years.
    In order to make the railway pass through the turbulent Xiamen Strait, railway construction workers, without modern construction equipment, used steel chisels and explosives to cut away half of dozens of surrounding stone mountains or level them into flat ground, and then transported more than one million cubic meters of stone materials from hundreds of miles away by flatbed trucks and sailboats to fill the sea, building two seawalls totaling five kilometers in length—the Xiamen Seawall and the Jimei Seawall. These two seawalls are magnificent projects rarely seen even in the world.
    The great desert, this is a place that people are afraid of at the mention of it. When the scorching sun shines at noon in summer, the desert is as hot as a steamer, and an egg buried in the sand can be cooked in five or six minutes, but in the morning you still have to wear a fur coat. The most annoying thing is the windy season, when a strong wind blows almost every morning, and the sand beats the face painfully. Sometimes when a black storm blows, the sandstorm moves with the wind like a giant wall dozens of feet high, and both people and animals are in danger of being buried. Our railway construction workers have controlled the wind and sand in this place and built the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway.
    The reactionary rulers of old China clamored for forty years to build the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan, but the people did not even see a shadow of the bridge until liberation. The folk song at that time said: "The water of the Yellow River cannot be harnessed, and the Yangtze River Bridge cannot be built." However, after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, construction workers took only a little over two years to tame the turbulent Yangtze River and erect the world-famous Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge on it.
    What is particularly proud is that our railway construction workers have conquered the Qin-Shu natural barrier, which has been regarded as a daunting journey since ancient times, and built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, a rare miracle in the history of world railway construction. Eighty percent of the 669-kilometer railway passes through mountainous areas such as the Qinling Mountains, Daba Mountains, and Jianmen Mountains. These mountainous areas are mostly areas with seven-level earthquakes, ancient glacial zones, large and small faults, and continuous collapse zones. In the process of building this railway, the construction heroes split thousands of mountain tops, filled countless deep valleys, pierced through the belly of the Qinling Mountains, chiseled through 304 tunnels with a total length of 84,428 meters, and excavated and filled more than 65 million cubic meters of earth and stone for the roadbed, and erected more than 990 large and small bridges.
    People often say, "Let the mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way." Over the past ten years, the railway construction workers of new China have used this tenacious spirit to make the railways cross the great rivers and lakes and climb over grasslands, deserts and plateaus.
    Of course, we are only taking the first step in a long march in railway construction, and the road ahead is still very long. However, under the leadership of the Party, Chinese railway workers have established such ambition and grand vision: to build our country's railways into the world's first-class railways in the near future. By then, the railways will be as dense as spider webs, and thousands of railway lines will extend to new steel bases with towering chimneys, to primeval forest areas with shady canopies, and to dotted towns and beautiful and fertile villages; many large bridges will fly over the deep rivers and lakes of our country. By then, electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will be towing various new types of vehicles all over the fields of the motherland! (Attached picture)

    铁龙飞越万水千山
    ——记新中国十年铁路建设
    本报记者　邵挺军
    展现在我面前的是，两张叶形的地图：一张是枯萎的叶子——只在东部和东北部分布着一些支离破碎的脉络，其余都是空白；另一张则是茁壮的叶子——不仅东部和东北部的脉络茂密了，而且向西南和西北部延伸了许多新的主脉支脉，显得四通八达了。
    前一张是旧中国的铁路图，后一张是新中国的铁路图。从这两张图的鲜明对比中，可以清楚地看到新中国的铁路建设有了多么令人振奋的飞速发展。
    旧中国，从清朝皇帝、北洋军阀到蒋介石，用了七十三年（1876—1948年）的时间，共修建了二万多公里铁路，而到全国解放时，由于战争的破坏，能勉强通车的只有一万一千多公里。这些铁路的分布是畸形的，大多集中在东北和沿海地区。帝国主义为掠夺中国的资源，勾结中国的地主、官僚和买办资产阶级修建的这些铁路，就像爬在人民身上的吸血管，无尽止地榨取着中国的资财。
    然而，在解放后短短的十年里，铁路建设发生了多么巨大而深刻的变化！铁路从掌握到人民手中的那一天起，就变成了一匹矫健的骏马，全身充满活力，在祖国广阔原野上飞奔前进！
    十年间，我们不但修复和改造了被国民党反动派破坏了的铁路，而且在1950年到1958年的九年里还新建了铁路干线，支线七千五百多公里（不包括企业专用线），新建和修复复线二千八百多公里，修复干线、支线一千七百多公里。到1958年底，全国通车里程已经达到了三万一千多公里，比1950年增加了39％左右。
    按照新中国十年修建的铁路里程计算，我们每年平均修了一千三百多公里，为解放前七十三年每年平均数的三倍多。特别是1958年以来，铁路建设由于大搞群众运动，更出现了轰轰烈烈、高速度发展的新局面。去年和今年，我们已修建和计划修建的新线和复线就有五千多公里。平均每年修建二千五百多公里。而蒋介石统治的二十多年，全国一共只修了二千六百多公里。
    谁都知道，旧中国在铁路建筑方面几乎是“一张白纸”。帝国主义者就是看准了这一点才在解放初耻笑我们说：中国共产党一无经验，二无技术人材，三无铁路器材，要修铁路、大桥，那是做梦！然而，“一张白纸”能难住我们吗？帝国主义的耻笑能吓倒我们吗？不能。还在1950年着手恢复经济时，我们就动手修筑四川的成渝铁路了。在苏联专家的热情帮助下，我们自己摸索着设计、施工。用了两年多一点的时间，就修成了反动统治者叫嚷了四十年始终没有修成的成渝铁路。
    在成渝铁路修成以后，我们紧接着修建了通往蒙古人民共和国的集宁二连线，广西黎塘通往南方贸易港口湛江的黎湛线，蓝村到山东半岛重要港口烟台的蓝烟线，提高京包铁路通过能力的丰台沙城线，通往越南民主共和国的来宾睦南关线，甘肃的天水兰州线，接通黔桂铁路的都匀贵阳段，通往苏联的又一国际干线兰新铁路东段等。这些铁路的先后建成，基本上改变了我国铁路分布的畸形状态。新建的铁路就像条条铁龙飞奔万水千山，已经伸向了除西藏以外的我国各个省区。如今，从祖国新疆乘上火车，只用几十小时就能直达东海之滨。从祖国东北的满洲里，坐火车一直能到达祖国南部边缘的睦南关。广大山区和边远地区的人民，可以乘坐舒适的火车，越过高山深谷、通过空气稀薄的大高原，或者穿过人烟稀少的大沙漠，驶过一望无际的大草原，直达祖国的首都——北京。
    现在，当我们看到西北的石油、皮毛，西南的粮食、土特产和有色金属，东南和东北的木材，北方的煤等都能通过铁路，源源供应全国工农业的发展需要的时候，我们不能不回想起十年来我们的筑路工人是怎样历尽艰险困苦，征服高山峻岭、深川恶水建筑起一条条铁路的。
    为了使铁路通过波涛滚滚的厦门海峡，筑路工人们在没有现代化施工设备的条件下，用钢凿和炸药把周围几十座石山削去一半或开成平地，再把采得的一百多万立方米的石料，用板车、帆船从百里外运来填海，筑成了两条共长达五公里的跨海大堤——厦门海堤和和集美海堤。这两条海堤即使在世界上也是少有的雄伟工程。
    大沙漠，这是人们一提到就害怕的地方。一到夏天中午烈日高照时，沙漠热得像蒸笼一样，把鸡蛋埋在沙里五、六分钟就能烫熟，但早晨却还得穿皮袄。最讨厌的是风沙季节，几乎每天上午要刮一阵大风，沙子打得脸直痛。有时刮起黑风来风沙像一道数十丈高的巨墙随风移动，人畜都有被埋没的危险。我们的筑路工人却在这种地方治住了风沙，筑成了包头到兰州的铁路。
    旧中国的反动统治者曾经叫嚷了四十年要在武汉修长江大桥，可是直到解放前人民连个桥影儿也没见。当时的民谣说：“黄河水，治不好，长江桥，修不了”。可是，解放后，在中国共产党的领导下，建筑工人们只用了两年多的时间，就驯服了波滔汹涌的长江，在它的上面架起了世界闻名的武汉长江大桥。
    尤其令人自豪的是，我们的筑路工人征服了旷古以来被视为畏途的秦蜀天险，修建成了世界铁路建筑史上不多见的奇迹——宝成铁路。这条全长六百六十九公里的铁路，有80％的线路在秦岭、大巴山、剑门等山岳地区经过，这些山区多是七级地震区域，有古代冰川地带，有大大小小的断层，有连续的崩坍地带。筑路英雄们在建筑这条铁路的过程中，曾经劈开了成千的山头，填满无数的深谷，打穿秦岭肚皮，凿穿了三百零四座总长度达八万四千四百二十八米的隧道，挖填了六千五百多万立方米的路基土石方，架起了九百九十多座大小桥梁。
    人们常说：“让高山低头，河水让路”，新中国的铁路建设职工十年来正是用这种顽强的精神，使铁路跨过了大河大江，让铁路爬过了草地、沙漠和高原。
    当然，在铁路建设上我们只是万里长征第一步，未来的路程还很长很长。然而，中国铁路工人在党的领导下，已经立下了这样的雄心和宏愿：要在不久将来把我国铁路建设成为世界第一流的铁路。到那时，铁路将密如蛛网，成千上万条铁路线，伸往烟囱林立的新钢铁基地，伸往遮天蔽日的原始森林区，伸往星罗棋布的城镇和美丽富饶的乡村；很多大桥将飞架在我国深川大河之上。到那时，电力机车、内燃机车将牵引着各种新型车辆在祖国原野上到处奔驰！（附图片）
