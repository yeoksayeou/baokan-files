Flames and Flowers
—The Ideological Struggle and Creation in Hungarian Literary and Art Circles
By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie

After the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956, Western imperialist elements clamored madly, saying, "Hungarian artists have all gone on strike, and literary and artistic creation will never recover." A small group of reactionary elements in Hungary also tried to make the world believe that as long as they did not create, there would be no literary and artistic works in Hungary. They arrogantly boasted, "The sun will not rise unless the rooster crows."

However, as Hungarian friends say, no matter how the dogs bark, the soldiers keep marching forward. Over the past three years, the broad masses of literary and art workers in Hungary, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, have achieved remarkable results in both ideological struggle and literary and artistic creation. Through fierce ideological struggle, revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois viewpoints have been refuted thoroughly. Today, in the socialist garden of art, flowers are blooming. Eloquent facts have severely ridiculed those who attempt to hinder the progress of history.

The Struggle to Eliminate Poisonous Weeds
Revisionist elements and various bourgeois representatives in Hungarian cultural circles still attempted to seize positions in the literary and artistic departments and engage in conspiracies to attack Marxism-Leninism after the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion was crushed.

Under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, revolutionary literary and art workers in Hungary reorganized their ranks and launched a resolute struggle against the enemy. In June 1957, the resolution of the National Conference of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party pointed out: "We must, through the leadership of the Communist Party members working in these fields, and by closely relying on the ranks of intellectuals loyal to the people, begin a resolute counter-offensive against the counter-revolution's current occupation of the cultural field. It is necessary to consolidate the positions of the Party and the state leadership politically and professionally, and to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements from the important positions of cultural life."

Some counter-revolutionary elements who committed heinous crimes were punished by law, and the organizations that were used to carry out anti-Party and anti-people activities were successively dissolved.

The arduous work of eliminating a large number of revisionist and various bourgeois toxins and garbage on the ideological front began!

Systematically criticizing the views of the veteran revisionist Lukács is a very important task. Lukács, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, began peddling revisionist goods as early as the 1920s. Lenin pointed out when he was alive that Lukács was only a Marxist in terms of rhetoric when it came to specific analysis of history and class analysis. Before 1956, his erroneous views had been criticized several times in Hungary, but he did not change his fundamental position. During the October counter-revolutionary rebellion, Lukács's revisionist remarks played a negative role in fanning the flames.

Since 1957, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, literary and art circles, and universities have held symposiums to expose Lukács's compromise and capitulationism.

Lukács obliterated class contradictions, distorted the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocated bourgeois democracy, opposed the working class's active struggle for the realization of communism, and advocated peaceful coexistence with bourgeois viewpoints in the ideological field. He also used idealistic "pure rationality" and "omnipotent democracy" to resist dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In literature and art, he opposed Lenin's principle of Party spirit and the creative method of socialist realism, and praised the spontaneity of creation and so-called "great realism."

Through extensive debate, Lukács's revisionist views have been bankrupt. In order to thoroughly eliminate the toxins he spread, this struggle is still continuing.

The second great victory on the Hungarian literary and art front in the past three years is the crushing of the views and cliques of reactionary "populist" writers. After the counter-revolutionary riots were defeated, the "populist" writers continued to adhere to their reactionary stance and expand their influence.

In July 1958, the Cultural Theory Working Group of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party published a program on "populist" writers, giving a detailed analysis and criticism of the literary and political activities of the "populist" writers. The working group pointed out that the basic characteristic of the "populist" writers' movement is to advocate taking the so-called "third way," a "third way" full of strong nationalism, a "third way" that does not exist in the world struggle between imperialism and socialism, namely the so-called "special Hungarian road." They opposed the leadership of the working class, and advocated that mental workers and the petty bourgeoisie should be the leaders of the country, and that the peasants are the main driving force for social development. They peddled dirty goods such as beautifully decorated "national communism," anarchism, Social Democratic reformism, and "advanced pessimism." During the October counter-revolutionary rebellion, they were the main members of the anti-socialist literary alliance headed by revisionists.

After the publication of the Party Central Committee Cultural Theory Working Group's program on "populist" writers, the literary and art circles conducted a profound criticism of the "populist" writers, causing them to suffer a crushing defeat and isolation.

The Party's Leadership Has Been Strengthened

Then, in August 1958, the Socialist Workers' Party promulgated the "Cultural Program." This program was formulated by the Party Central Committee and widely solicited the opinions of relevant personnel in the cultural departments, artists, scientists, teachers, workers, and peasants. Karoly Gyula, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Workers' Party, pointed out that this is the first time since the liberation of Hungary that a program involving all sectors of culture has been formulated through scientific analysis and principled generalization, and it is of great significance to the development of literature and art.

In this program, the Party conducted a Marxist analysis of the cultural and ideological schools of thought between the two world wars, summarized the achievements of the cultural revolution since the liberation of Hungary, criticized the revisionist and various bourgeois tendencies that still exist in literature, art, drama, and film, and pointed out that intellectuals must strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism and conduct ideological transformation; and carry out ideological struggles frequently to thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, so as to make culture face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialist construction more closely.

The Cultural Program stipulates that cultural work should become an organic part of the work of the entire Party. In the past, many Party organizations regarded cultural work only as the affair of the Party organizations in the cultural departments and a matter for intellectuals. This view had hindered the development of cultural work to a certain extent. The Party criticized this understanding, emphasizing that the cultural revolution is a part of the socialist revolution, and requiring all Party members, cadres, and the working class to actively participate in cultural activities and help the Party solve the tasks in the cultural revolution.

For more than a year, Party organizations at all levels have attached importance to cultural work, and the Party Central Committee has organized Party members and cadres to study this important document through Party education. Many local councils, factories, institutions, and school Party organizations and the masses have studied and discussed the Party's cultural policy and formulated their own departmental work plans.

This spring, the Cultural Theory Working Group of the Party Central Committee also published a "Thesis on Several Issues of Hungarian Literature after Liberation." Based on the Cultural Program promulgated by the Party half a year ago, this document detailedly analyzed and summarized the development of literature and the various problems currently existing since the national liberation, and pointed out the path for the future development of literature.

In the course of sharp ideological struggle, the ranks of progressive literary and art workers with Party members as the core have been consolidated and grown stronger day by day. They have improved their understanding, clarified their goals, gradually unified their views on certain issues and their work steps, and united to shoulder the responsibility of enlivening cultural life.

The Party and the government have shown the greatest patience to those writers, actors, musicians, and painters who have gone astray and wavered, and have had extensive contact with them, adhering to the policy of both struggle and unity, giving them time to let practical life educate them to recognize the mistakes of their views and behaviors. Due to the Party's firm Marxist-Leninist policy and the influence of practical life, these people are gradually waking up.

During this period, due to the rapid consolidation of the socialist system, constant differentiation also occurred within the ranks of hostile intellectuals. More and more people are leaning towards the people's regime and have begun to criticize their past mistakes. Only a small handful of die-hard revisionists and representatives of bourgeois ideology are still stubborn. Hungarian friends say that this is a dead pig not afraid of boiling water. But they have been isolated.

The Party pointed out that ideological struggle is a long-term process, which is currently deepening and winning victories steadily.

Flowers Blooming

Due to the rapid restoration and consolidation of Hungary's national politics and economy, and the impact of the high tide of socialist construction, on the basis of the ideological clarification process that has begun among literary and art workers, literary and artistic creation has also begun to develop healthily. Starting from the ideological standpoint of the working class, works that depict real life and the history of the working class's struggle, especially those that reflect the national people's crushing of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in 1956, are increasingly increasing.

In literature, in the works published in 1958, works with modern political themes accounted for 40%. Novels such as "October Storm" by writer Berkesi András, "Raging Waves" by Molnár Géza, and "Whirlwind" by Urbán Ernő, which described sharp issues in reality, were warmly welcomed by the majority of readers. The poetry collections "Rope Dance" by poet Károlyi István and "On the Road of Time" by Fodor József have also received high praise.

The strenuous labor of the old Communist Party writers over the past three years is particularly admirable. Boloni György serves as the chairman of the Hungarian Literary Committee. In addition to his busy work, he completed his new work "Listen, Dániel!", and is also writing a long novel reflecting the modern Hungarian proletarian revolutionary struggle. The author of the famous long novels "Carpathian Symphony" and "Tisza River is Burning," Illés Béla, recently published a collection of short stories "Crossroads" and a play "Rainbow" reflecting the heroic struggle of the Hungarian working class in 1919. Gergely Sándor wrote "Great Land," Madarász Emil wrote "Blue House"...These veterans on the literary and art front are energetic and full of energy, giving great encouragement to young authors.

A very gratifying phenomenon in the literary world is the emergence of a group of young authors. These young people all grew up in the new society, some are workers in the Csepel factory, and some are sons and daughters of peasants or fishermen on the banks of the Danube.... In the practice of life, they personally experienced everything that the new society gave them, and they are full of confidence in the future. After the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion was crushed, they responded to the Party's call and picked up the weapon of creation.

In terms of drama, the proportion of domestic scripts with modern themes performed in various theaters has greatly increased, which is a rare phenomenon since liberation. In the past year, around the issue of the essence of the October counter-revolutionary event that everyone is concerned about, theaters in Budapest have successively staged four plays, including "Blinded Eyes" by Feyer István, "Storm" by Dobozy Imre, "People of Pest" by Mesterházi Lajos, and "Dark Sky" by Darvas József. These plays profoundly analyzed the causes and nature of the October counter-revolutionary event from different perspectives, and depicted the attitudes of people from all walks of life towards this event. The performances of these plays were universally welcomed by the working people. The stage has become a political podium, and the eloquent facts brought to the stage educate thousands of viewers. The power of truth and art makes people more sober and firm, and more brave and actively fight to defend and build socialism!

There have also been significant changes in film, with more and more good films appearing day by day. Hungarian comrades believe that the recent films "39th Brigade," "Maid Anna," "Yesterday," and "Sleepless Years," which are both ideologically and artistically of a very high standard, mark a new development in the Hungarian film industry.

In terms of fine arts and music creation, many excellent works have also appeared in the past year. Especially during the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, fine arts and music creation formed a new climax.

Facing the Working Masses

Recently, the connection between Hungarian literary and art workers and the broad masses of workers and peasants has been increasingly strengthened, and a broad movement is taking shape.

As early as more than two years ago, when writer Feyer István first wrote the first play "Blinded Eyes" reflecting the October counter-revolutionary event, the Party Committee of the 13th District of Budapest presided over a discussion and study by workers. Everyone gave the author great encouragement, and also put forward many valuable opinions on the script. The author further revised and enriched his work according to the opinions put forward by the workers, making this script more profoundly and accurately reflect the objective reality.

Before "Blinded Eyes" was staged at the József Attila Theatre in the capital, some gentlemen who were obsessed with classical plays and liked to peddle Western bourgeois goods advised the theater负责人 and actors not to perform this script. They predicted that the audience would not like it. However, the situation after the performance was completely contrary to the ideas of those "prophets." The audience expressed their opinions with warm applause, and soon the tickets for several months were all booked.

The Socialist Workers' Party clearly put forward that literature and art must face the workers and peasants, depict the lives, struggles, and the great reality of socialist construction of the working people, and must overcome the phenomenon of literary and art workers being divorced from reality.

Most writers, actors, painters, and composers have also gradually personally realized that it is difficult to carry out meaningful creation if they are divorced from the masses and do not understand real life.

The Party, the government, and various social organizations strongly support intellectuals in connecting with workers and peasants, mobilize intellectuals to go to the countryside and factories to get close to life; and also call on the working people to actively participate in cultural life. The vast number of readers actively demand that writers write more works depicting modern life, and often organize work discussion meetings to provide authors with opinions, which also gives great encouragement to literary and art workers.

In April of this year, the Hungarian National Federation of Art Trade Unions called on the practice of strengthening the connection between artists and workers and peasants to be popularized throughout the country and to become a movement. After that, this work was further developed.

After the Seventh National Art Exhibition of Hungary, the Art Union held a forum for workers and artists. At the meeting, the workers put forward many valuable opinions on the art exhibition and invited the artists to their factories and mines to create. The trade union also provided convenience for 54 artists who went to state-owned farms and agricultural machinery stations to create.

Actors often go to the countryside and factories to visit, perform for workers and peasants, and assist the masses in carrying out recreational activities. They also often participate in workers' forums to listen to the audience's opinions on their performances. For example, the filming of the film "Sleepless Years," which depicts the life and struggle history of Csepel workers, received great help from Csepel workers.

The connection between writers and the masses is also becoming increasingly close. At the end of April this year, some famous writers and poets went to Veszprém County to visit agricultural production cooperatives and listened to reports on the cooperative movement. When Hungary held the National Book Week in early June, meetings between writers and readers were widely organized. A large number of writers from the capital went to other places to participate in the activities of Book Week and visited factories and cooperatives. Some writers have now established fixed and regular connections with factories and enterprises or agricultural production cooperatives.

With the continuous improvement of the ideological level of the vast number of literary and art workers and the deepening of their understanding of real life, more and more beautiful flowers are blooming in the Hungarian literary world.

    烈火和鲜花
    ——匈牙利文艺界的思想斗争和创作
    本报记者　王崇杰
    西方帝国主义分子在1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱后，曾疯狂地叫嚣说：“匈牙利的艺术家都罢工了，文艺创作将永劫不复”。匈牙利国内的一小撮反动分子也曾想让世界相信，只要他们不动手创作，匈牙利就不会出现文学和艺术作品。他们狂妄地吹嘘说：“只要公鸡不叫，太阳就不会升起来。”
    然而，正像匈牙利朋友们所说的，不管狗怎么叫，战士们却是不停地前进。三年来，匈牙利全国广大的文艺工作者在社会主义工人党的领导下，在思想斗争和文艺创作方面都取得了显著的成绩。经过激烈的思想斗争，修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级观点已被驳得体无完肤。今天，在社会主义的艺术园地里，朵朵鲜花怒放。雄辩的事实狠狠地嘲笑了那些企图阻挡历史前进的狂徒们。
    清除毒草的斗争
  匈牙利文化界的修正主义分子和形形色色的资产阶级代表人物，在反革命武装暴乱被击溃后，仍然企图在文学和艺术部门夺取阵地，从事阴谋活动，向马克思列宁主义进攻。
    在社会主义工人党的领导下，匈牙利革命的文艺工作者整顿了自己的队伍，向敌人展开了坚决的斗争。1957年6月，社会主义工人党全国代表会议的决议指出：“我们要通过在这些领域中工作的共产党员的领导，紧紧地依靠忠于人民的知识分子的队伍，开始向反革命目前对文化领域的侵占进行坚决的反攻。必须在政治上和在业务上巩固党和国家领导的阵地，把反革命分子从文化生活的重要阵地中清除出去。”
    一些罪大恶极的反革命分子受到了法律的惩办，被利用来进行反党反人民活动的组织机构先后被解散。
    在思想战线上清除大量的修正主义以及五花八门的资产阶级毒素和垃圾的艰苦工作开始了！
    系统地批判老牌修正主义分子卢卡奇的观点是很重要的任务。披着马克思列宁主义外衣的卢卡奇，还在二十年代便开始贩卖修正主义的私货。列宁在世时就曾指出过，卢卡奇在具体分析历史、分析阶级的时候只是词藻上的马克思主义者。1956年以前，在匈牙利曾几次对他的错误观点进行过批判，但他并没有改变自己的根本立场。十月反革命叛乱时，卢卡奇的修正主义言论起了煽风点火的恶劣作用。
    从1957年以来，匈牙利科学院、文艺界和高等学校等单位都举行了讨论会，揭发了卢卡奇的妥协和投降主义。
    卢卡奇抹煞阶级矛盾，歪曲无产阶级专政，主张资产阶级的民主，反对工人阶级积极为实现共产主义而斗争，主张在意识形态方面同资产阶级观点和平共处。他并以唯心主义的“纯理性”和“万能的民主”来抵制辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。在文艺方面他反对列宁的党性原则和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，歌颂创作的自发性和所谓“伟大的现实主义”。
    通过广泛的辩论，卢卡奇的修正主义观点已经破产了。为彻底清除他散布的毒素，这一斗争目前还在继续着。
    三年来，匈牙利文艺战线上的第二个大胜利，是粉碎了反动的“民粹派”作家的观点和小集团。“民粹派”的作家在反革命暴动被击溃后，仍然坚持他们的反动立场，扩大他们的影响。
    1958年7月，社会主义工人党中央文化理论工作组，发表了关于“民粹派”作家的纲领。对“民粹派”作家的文学和政治活动给予了详细的分析和批判。工作组指出：“民粹派”作家的运动的基本特点是主张走充满着强烈的民族主义精神的所谓“第三条道路”，一条在帝国主义和社会主义之间的世界性斗争中不存在的“第三条道路”，即所谓“特殊的匈牙利道路”。他们反对工人阶级的领导，而主张脑力劳动者和小资产阶级应当是国家的领导者，农民是社会发展的主要动力。他们卖弄装璜美丽的“民族共产主义”、无政府主义、社会民主党的改良主义和“先进的悲观主义”等肮脏货物。在十月反革命叛乱时，他们是以修正主义者为首的、反社会主义文学联盟的主要成员。
    在党中央文化理论工作组关于“民粹派”作家的纲领公布后，文艺界对“民粹派”作家进行了深刻的批判，使他们遭到了惨败和孤立。
    党的领导加强了
    接着，1958年8月，社会主义工人党又颁布了“文化纲领”。这个纲领是由党的中央委员会制定的，并广泛地征求了文化部门有关人员、艺术家、科学家、教师、工人和农民的意见。社会主义工人党政治局委员卡拉伊·久洛指出：从匈牙利解放以来，这是第一次通过科学的分析和原则性的概括而制定的、涉及到文化各部门的纲领，对文学艺术的发展也有着极大的意义。
    在这个纲领中，党对于两次世界大战之间的文化思想流派进行了马克思主义的分析，总结了匈牙利解放后文化革命所取得的成就，批判了还存在于文学、艺术、戏剧、电影中的修正主义和各种资产阶级倾向，指出知识分子必须加强马克思列宁主义学习，进行思想改造；经常开展思想斗争，彻底消除资产阶级的思想影响，以便使文化面向工农群众，更密切地为社会主义建设服务。
    文化纲领规定，文化工作应成为整个党的工作的有机组成部分。过去不少党组织把文化工作只当作文化部门党组织的事和属于知识分子的问题。这种观点曾在一定程度上阻碍了文化工作的开展。党批判了这种认识，强调指出文化革命是社会主义革命的一部分，要求全体党员、干部、工人阶级积极参加文化活动，帮助党来解决文化革命中的任务。
    一年多以来，各级党组织对文化工作都重视起来了，党中央并通过党内教育，组织党员干部学习了这个重要的文件。许多地方议会、工厂、机关和学校的党组织和群众都学习和讨论了党的文化政策，制定了本部门的工作规划。
    今年春天，党中央文化理论工作组又发表了“关于解放后匈牙利文学的几个问题”的论纲。这个文件，根据半年前党颁布的文化纲领，详细地分析和总结了全国解放后文学的发展和当前存在的各种问题，指出了今后文学发展的途径。
    在尖锐的思想斗争过程中，以党员为核心的进步文艺工作者的队伍一天天地巩固壮大起来了。他们提高了认识，明确了目标，逐步统一了对某些问题的看法和工作步调，团结一致地承担了活跃文化生活的责任。
    党和政府对那些误入歧途和动摇不定的作家、演员、音乐家、画家，表现了最大的耐心，同他们进行了广泛的接触，抱着又斗争又团结的方针，给予他们时间，让实际生活教育他们认识自己观点和行为的错误。由于党采取了坚定的马克思列宁主义政策和实际生活的影响，这些人也正在逐渐清醒过来。
    这期间，由于社会主义制度的迅速巩固，敌对的知识分子内部也不断发生了分化。愈来愈多的人向人民政权靠拢，并开始批判自己过去的错误。只有一小撮死硬的修正主义分子和资产阶级思想的代表人物，还在顽固不化。匈牙利朋友们说，这是死猪不怕热水烫。但是他们已经被孤立起来了。
    党指出，思想斗争是一个长期过程，目前正在日趋深入，节节胜利。
      朵朵鲜花盛开
    由于匈牙利全国政治和经济上的迅速恢复和巩固，以及社会主义建设高潮的影响，在文艺工作者开始了思想澄清过程的基础上，文学艺术创作也开始了健康的发展。从工人阶级的思想立场出发，描写现实生活和工人阶级的斗争历史，特别是反映全国人民1956年粉碎反革命叛乱的创作，正在日益增多。
    在文学方面，1958年出版的作品中，以现代政治题材为内容的作品就占到40％。作家别尔凯西·安德拉什的“十月的暴风雨”、莫尔纳尔·格佐的“怒海狂涛”、乌尔邦·艾尔诺的“旋风”等很多描述现实中尖锐问题的小说，受到了广大读者热烈欢迎。诗人卡拉伊·伊斯特万的“绳索舞”、福多尔·尤惹夫的“在时间的道路上”等诗集，也得到了很高的评价。
    三年来，老共产党员作家们紧张的劳动是特别值得钦佩的。波仑尼·捷尔吉担任匈牙利文学委员会主席，在繁忙的工作之余，他完成了新作“听，丹契奇！”，还正在写作反映近代匈牙利无产阶级革命斗争的长篇小说。著名长篇小说“喀尔巴阡山交响曲”和“蒂萨河在燃烧”的作者伊莱什·贝拉，最近又出版了短篇小说集“十字路口”和反映1919年匈牙利工人阶级英勇斗争的剧本“虹”。盖尔盖伊·山道尔写了“伟大的土地”，马达腊什·埃米尔写了“蓝房子”……。这些文艺战线上的老战士们精力充沛，干劲十足，给予年青作者很大的鼓舞。
    文坛上非常令人可喜的现象是一批年青作者的出现。这些青年都是在新社会中成长起来的，有的是切佩尔工厂的工人，有的是农民或多瑙河畔渔夫的儿女……。在生活的实践中，他们亲身体验到新社会给予他们的一切，对未来满怀信心。在反革命武装叛乱被粉碎后，他们便响应党的号召，拿起了创作的武器。
    戏剧方面，各剧院上演现代题材的本国剧本的比重大为增加，这是解放以来少有的现象。一年来，在布达佩斯各剧院围绕着这个大家关心的反映十月反革命事件的本质的问题，先后上演了费耶尔·伊斯特万写的“被蒙蔽的眼睛”、多博济·伊姆雷的“暴风雨”、迈什泰尔哈济·拉约什的“佩斯的人们”和达尔瓦什·尤惹夫的“阴暗的天”等四个剧本。这些剧本从不同的角度深刻地分析了十月反革命事件的起因和性质，描绘了社会各阶层人民对这一事件的态度。这些剧的演出受到劳动人民普遍欢迎。舞台变成了政治讲台，搬上舞台的雄辩的事实教育着千千万万的观众。真理和艺术的力量使人们更加清醒和坚定起来，更勇敢更积极地去为保卫和建设社会主义而奋斗！
    电影方面也有了显著的变化，好影片一天比一天多。匈牙利同志们认为最近一年来上演的思想性和艺术水平都很高的影片“第三十九旅”、“女仆安娜”、“昨天”和“不眠的年代”，标志了匈牙利电影事业的新发展。
    在美术和音乐创作方面，一年多来也出现了许多优秀的作品。特别是在纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年时，美术和音乐创作形成了一个新的高潮。
    面向劳动群众
    最近，匈牙利文艺工作者与广大工农群众的联系日益加强，并且正在形成一个广泛的运动。
    还在两年多前，当作家费耶尔·伊斯特万首先写成第一个反映十月反革命事件的剧本“被蒙蔽的眼睛”时，就曾由布达佩斯第十三区党委会主持，召集工人进行了讨论研究。大家给予作者很大的鼓励，同时也对剧本提出了很多宝贵的意见。作者根据工人们提出的意见进一步修改和充实了他的作品，使这个剧本更深刻和准确地反映了客观现实。
    “被蒙蔽的眼睛”在首都尤惹夫·阿蒂拉剧院上演之前，一些迷恋古典剧和喜欢搬弄西方资产阶级货色的先生们曾劝剧院负责人和演员们不要演出这个剧本。他们预言观众是不会喜欢它的。可是演出后的情况完全和那些“预言家”们的想法相反，观众们以热烈的掌声表达了他们的意见，很快地几个月的票就都被预订一空。
    社会主义工人党明确提出了文艺必须面向工农，描写劳动人民的生活、斗争和社会主义建设的伟大现实，必须克服文艺工作者脱离实际的现象。
    大部分作家、演员、画家、作曲家也逐渐亲身体会到：脱离群众，不了解现实生活，是很难进行有意义的创作的。
    党、政府和各社会团体都大力支持知识分子同工农联系，动员知识分子下乡下厂接近生活；同时也号召劳动人民积极参与文化生活。广大读者积极要求作家们多写描绘现代生活的作品，并且经常组织作品讨论会，对作者提供意见，也给予了文艺工作者以很大鼓励。
    今年4月，匈牙利全国艺术工会联合会号召把加强艺术家同工农联系的作法普及到全国各地，并使之成为一个运动。以后，这项工作得到了进一步的开展。
    在匈牙利第七次全国美术展览会之后，艺术工会召开了一次工人和美术家的座谈会，会上工人们对画展提出了很多宝贵的意见，并且邀请美术家到他们的工厂和矿山去创作。工会也对五十四名到国营农场和农业机器站去进行创作的美术家提供了便利条件。
    演员们经常下乡下工厂参观，为工人农民演出，协助群众开展文娱活动。他们也经常参加工人的座谈会，听取观众对他们演出的意见，如描写切佩尔工人的生活和斗争史的影片“不眠的年代”的摄制，就得到切佩尔工人很大的帮助。
    作家同群众的联系也日益密切。今年4月末，一些著名作家和诗人都到维斯普雷姆州去参观了农业生产合作社，听取了关于合作化运动情况的报告。6月初匈牙利举行全国图书周时，广泛组织了作家同读者的会见。首都大批作家到外地参加了图书周的活动，参观了工厂和合作社。现在已有一些作家同工厂企业或农业生产合作社建立了固定的经常的联系。
    随着广大文艺工作者思想水平的不断提高和对现实生活了解的加深，匈牙利文坛上开放出越来越多的艳丽的花朵。
