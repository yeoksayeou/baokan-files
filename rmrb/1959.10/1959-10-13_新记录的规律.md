　　The Law of New Records
　　Henan Luoyang　Huang Bingzhong
    Zhang Jiying is a nationally renowned typesetting expert, and I am a news reporter. Whenever we meet, we inevitably talk about production, asking about his recent production records. Over time, I discovered that each new record he achieved was not accidental but closely linked to the high tide of the overall social leap forward. 1958 was a period of comprehensive great leap forward in various undertakings in our country. From April to September alone, he created four national records in a row. This year, Luoyang City experienced two upsurges in the leap forward, and Comrade Zhang Jiying also created two new records. The previous time was 6,384 characters per hour, and the second time was 6,648 characters per hour.
    From the law of Comrade Zhang Jiying's creation of new records, we can see that every new production record has its unique process of conception and growth. His creation of new records is phased. After a new record is produced, it must go through a period of diligent study, hard practice, and repeated research, or innovate tools and improve operating methods, or improve the level of operational proficiency, in order to conceive another new and higher production record. However, it also needs the nourishment of the climate of the Great Leap Forward. Only with a suitable climate, coupled with the gardener's diligent soil loosening and fertilization, can the embryo of this new record grow and spring up vigorously.
    Our social system is precisely a high-quality and fertile nursery,孕育着无穷无尽的新的生产记录的胚芽,催促着一切新事物的迅速成长. As long as we are determined to be a diligent gardener, boost greater enthusiasm, and carefully cultivate, then in our hands, we will inevitably be able to continuously create unprecedented miracles.

　　新记录的规律
　　河南洛阳　黄秉忠
    张继英是全国闻名的排字能手，我是新闻记者，见面之间，总得谈到生产情况，问问他新近的生产记录。久而久之，就发现他的每一次新记录的出现，并非偶然，而是与整个社会跃进的高潮紧密结合。1958年是我国各项事业全面大跃进的时期，仅在4到9月中，他就连续创造了四次全国最高纪录。今年，洛阳市出现过两次跃进高潮，张继英同志也两次创造了新的记录。前一次每小时拣字6，384个，第二次每小时拣字6，648。
    从张继英同志创造新纪录的规律里，可以看到每一项新的生产记录，都有它独特的孕育和成长过程。他创造新记录是有阶段性的，一项新记录产生以后，必须经过一段勤学苦炼、反复钻研，或则革新工具、改进操作方法，或则提高操作熟练程度，才能孕育出另一项新的、更高的生产记录。但是，它又需要大跃进的气候的滋润。只有具备了适宜的气候，再加上园丁的辛勤的松土、施肥，这种孕育着的新记录的胚芽，才会出土、猛长。
    我们的社会制度，正是一块土质优良、肥沃的苗圃，孕育着无穷无尽的新的生产记录的胚芽，催促着一切新事物的迅速成长。只要我们下决心做一个辛勤的园丁，鼓起更大的干劲，精心栽培，那么，在我们的手里，就必然能够不断地创造出前无古人的奇迹。
