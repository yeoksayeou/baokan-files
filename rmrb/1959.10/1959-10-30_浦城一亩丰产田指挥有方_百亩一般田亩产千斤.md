Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th -- The single-season rice in the Village Head Brigade of the Suburban Commune of Pucheng County, Fujian Province, has achieved high yields over large areas. The brigade's one-mu "command field" harvested 1,503 jin of dry grain, an increase of 2.82 times compared to last year. The surrounding 167 mu of single-season rice with poorer soil yielded an average of 1,039 jin per mu, an increase of 1.6 times compared to last year.

　　Using the experience of high-yield fields to guide ordinary fields to achieve high yields is an important experience of this brigade in leading agricultural production. The Village Head Brigade has 168 mu of sticky yellow mud fields with low yields. In order to transform these low-yield fields into high-yield fields, the Party branch decided that the branch secretary, the brigade leader, and other cadres, experienced farmers, technicians, and commune members, a total of 37 people, would form a specialized team to conduct high-yield and large-area high-yield experiments. They planted one mu of "command field" in the 168 mu of yellow mud fields, adopting the method of "command field" taking the lead in experiments, gaining experience, and then guiding the remaining 167 mu to strive for large-area high yields.

　　In the high-yield experiment, they found out the reasons why the yields of these fields were not high in the past. In addition to the poor soil quality, the main reason was the relatively extensive cultivation. The basic method of increasing production is to exert great effort, improve the soil, and earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Therefore, they first deep-plowed, changed furrow irrigation to rotation irrigation, rationally densely planted, applied sufficient base fertilizer, and cultivated strong seedlings in the command field to set an example, and then promoted it to the surrounding areas. The quality of cultivation in the surrounding fields has been generally improved. More than 160 mu of fields have been ploughed three to four inches deeper than last year. Combined with deep ploughing, more than 100 dan of fertilizer were applied per mu in layers. All "September Freeze" improved varieties were selected, rational close planting was implemented, five cultivations, weeding and topdressing were carried out, and rational irrigation and timely drying of the fields were ensured... Through the planting of the "command field," the cadres more timely guided the commune members to overcome drought and pests.

    浦城一亩丰产田指挥有方
    百亩一般田亩产千斤
    新华社福州29日电　福建浦城县城郊公社村头大队单季稻大面积高产。这个大队的一亩“指挥田”收了一千五百零三斤干谷，比去年增产二点八二倍；它周围的一百六十七亩土质较差的单季稻平均亩产一千零三十九斤，也比去年增产一点六倍。
    运用丰产田的经验指导一般田获得丰产，是这个大队领导农业生产的一项重要经验。村头大队有一百六十八亩粘性黄泥田，产量较低。党支部为了把这些低产田变为高产田，决定由支部书记、大队长等负责，吸收其他干部、老农、技术员和社员共三十七人，组成专业队，进行高产和大面积丰产试验。他们在一百六十八亩黄泥田中种了一亩“指挥田”，采取“指挥田”先走一步进行试验的办法，取得经验，再指导其余一百六十七亩争取大面积丰产。
    在丰产试验中，他们找出了过去这些田产量不高的原因，除了土质不好外，主要是耕作比较粗放。增产的基本办法是鼓足干劲，改良土壤，认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”。于是他们首先在指挥田里深耕、改串灌为轮灌、合理密植、施足基肥、育壮秧等，作出样子，然后向周围推广。周围田地的耕作质量普遍提高，一百六十多亩田都比去年深翻了三寸到四寸，结合深翻每亩分层施肥一百多担，全部选用了“九月冻”良种，实行合理密植，进行了五次中耕除草和追肥，作到合理灌水和适时烤田……。通过种植“指挥田”，干部更加及时地指导社员战胜了旱灾和虫害。
