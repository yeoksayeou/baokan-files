Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: Shanghai's million industrial workers are offering grand gifts to the National Conference of Heroes. In the middle ten days of October, the city's total industrial output value (excluding suburban areas) increased by 59% compared to the first ten days. Among the major products, the output of twelve types of products, including mining equipment, heavy transport equipment, metal cutting machine tools, bicycles, and fountain pens, exceeded the planned output by more than double.

Since the Fifth Steel Plant's converter workshop created a method for shortening the furnace repair cycle and compressing the furnace construction time, various factories in Shanghai's metallurgical industry have launched a wave of learning from the Fifth Plant and catching up with the Fifth Plant, increasing steel production by 11.9% in the middle ten days compared to the first ten days. The Sixth Steel Plant's average daily steel output was around 400 tons in the past. Since the middle ten days, it has continuously created seven new records, with the highest reaching more than 530 tons. The steel qualification rate in the middle ten days reached 98%, and the first-class product rate accounted for about 85%.

Shanghai's electromechanical industry has launched a production increase and savings campaign to "not let the contract pass the New Year." According to the execution of delivery contracts, each machinery factory classifies products, ranks them, and formulates measures to complete the state plan ahead of schedule, ensuring that all delivery contracts for this year are fulfilled.

With the deepening of the competition and technical innovation movement, many factories have a group of production workers who have completed their October production tasks ahead of schedule. In the fifteen working days of the first and middle ten days of the month, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant put forward 450 large and small innovation proposals. By the 20th, nearly 200 workers in the plant had completed their entire month's workload. The Shanghai Boiler Factory also had 61 workers who completed their entire month's production tasks.

The production of light industry, the chemical industry, and the textile industry is also constantly rising. For example, the paper industry continuously achieved new high-yield records on the 15th and 16th, and the amount of paper produced also broke through 1,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th: On the eve of the opening of the National "Conference of Heroes," the production on Tianjin's industrial front continues to rise comprehensively. The total industrial output value exceeded the mid-ten day plan by 1.46%, an increase of 12.8% compared to the first ten days. The output of many important products has increased significantly: steel increased by 4%, steel products by 25%, soda ash by 20%, paper and paperboard by 56%, and cotton yarn by 8%. The quality of products has also risen rapidly. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the standard product rate in the middle ten days was 100%, and the top-grade first-class product rate increased from 90.43% in the first ten days to 93.92%.

Since the middle ten days, the city's employees have been inspired by the upcoming National Conference of Heroes. Many factories, workshops, teams, and individuals have repeatedly increased their production plans. The competition movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, and the technical innovation movement are vigorously developing, powerfully promoting production. The entire staff of the Fourth Internal Combustion Engine Factory carried out technical innovations to address the problem of insufficient equipment after the production tasks were added. On the 17th, 21 innovation proposals were implemented in one day. Among them, the reform of the punching die increased production efficiency by 54 times.

    新华社上海24日电　上海百万产业工人向全国群英大会献厚礼，10月中旬，全市工业总产值（不包括郊区）比上旬增加59％；在主要产品中，产量超过计划一倍以上的有矿山设备、超重运输设备、金属切削机床、自行车、自来水笔等十二种。
    上海冶金工业自第五钢铁厂转炉车间创造缩短修炉周期及压缩砌炉时间以后，各厂纷纷掀起了学五厂、赶五厂的热潮，使中旬钢产量比上旬提高11.9％，第六钢铁厂以往钢的平均日产量是四百吨左右，中旬以来连续创造了七次新纪录，最高达到五百三十多吨。中旬钢的合格率达到98％，一级品率占85％左右。
    上海机电工业掀起了“不让合同过年”的增产节约运动。各机械厂根据交货合同的执行情况，按产品分类排队，逐项拟订提前完成国家计划的措施，保证全部履行今年交货合同。
    随着竞赛和技术革新运动的深入展开，不少工厂都有一批生产工人提前完成了10月份的生产任务。上海机床厂在上中两旬的十五个工作日里，提出了大小革新建议四百五十条，到20日止，全厂已有近二百个工人完成了全月工作量。上海锅炉厂也有六十一个工人完成了全月的生产任务。
    轻工业、化学工业、纺织工业生产也不断高涨，如造纸工业15、16两天连续出现高产新纪录，抄造量也突破千吨。
    新华社天津24日电　全国“群英会”开幕前夕，天津市工业战线生产持续全面上升。工业总产值超额1.46％完成了中旬计划，比上旬提高12.8％。许多重要产品的产量都有大幅度的增长：钢增长4％，钢材25％，纯碱20％，纸和纸板56％，棉纱8％。产品的质量也迅速上升，以棉纱为例，中旬标准品率为100％，上等一级品率由上旬的90.43％上升到93.92％。
    中旬以来，全市职工为群英大会的即将召开所鼓舞，许多工厂、车间、小组和个人，一次再次增订生产计划，学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛运动和技术革新运动风起云涌，有力地推动了生产。第四内燃机厂全厂职工针对生产任务追加后设备不足的问题大搞技术革新，17日一天就实现革新建议二十一件。其中改革冲眼模具，将生产效率提高了五十四倍。
