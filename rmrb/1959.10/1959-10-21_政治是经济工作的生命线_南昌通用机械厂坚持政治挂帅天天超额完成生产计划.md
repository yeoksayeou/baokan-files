Politics is the Lifeline of Economic Work
Nanchang General Machinery Factory Adheres to Putting Politics in Command and Exceeds Production Plans Daily

(Our Dispatch) Nanchang General Machinery Factory's Party committee constantly conducts political and ideological education for its employees, enabling them to maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit. Despite outdated equipment and weak technical strength, for nine months and twenty days this year, they have exceeded their production plans every month and every day. The total output value has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, and the finished product rate has reached 97% to 99%. This fact vividly illustrates that adhering to putting politics in command on the industrial front is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a great leap forward in production.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, all employees of the Nanchang General Machinery Factory worked hard and cleverly, achieving great results. The total output value increased by more than three times compared to 1957. This year, according to the requirements of the state plan, without increasing equipment or technical strength, the total output value is required to double again compared to last year, and many products are new varieties with complex technology, precise structure, and large volume. The factory's Party committee believes that the more difficult the situation, the more important it is to put politics in command, boost the revolutionary enthusiasm of employees, and mobilize the masses to overcome various difficulties in order to ensure the completion of the state plan.

The factory first educated employees to recognize the favorable situation, establish a belief in victory, and arouse soaring enthusiasm. At the beginning of this year, in order to meet the upcoming production and processing tasks of five major sets of equipment, including smelting, steel rolling, coking, power stations, and agricultural water pumps, the Party committee, while mobilizing the masses to prepare for production, deeply understood and analyzed the ideological situation of the employees at that time, and found that some employees had insufficient confidence and were afraid of difficulties and slackening. The Party committee organized cadres and workers to study the resolutions and relevant documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and guided employees to clearly understand the political and economic significance of continuing the Great Leap Forward this year and recognize the current favorable situation through airing views, debates, and discussions. At the same time, by summarizing the achievements and typical examples of the Great Leap Forward last year, it criticized the fear of difficulties and slackening mood. Many employees said, "The achievements last year were great, but socialism cannot be built in one year. How can we stop after taking the first step well!" Some employees discussed the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year and the situation of manufacturing 411 large Roots No. 5 blowers with simple equipment in one week last year, and said, "Thinking about last year, we are motivated this year. What could be done last year can be done even better this year." On this basis, the Party committee immediately organized a rally for all employees to take a leap forward oath, and resoundingly put forward the fighting slogan of "Re-boost our efforts, strive for excellence together, ensure that the output value doubles, and vow to win the red flag of a greater leap forward," quickly setting off a production upsurge. Many difficulties that seemed insurmountable were successfully overcome. The factory completed the production task for the first quarter in an all-round way thirteen days ahead of schedule, with a total output value more than five times higher than the same period last year.

The factory Party committee also paid attention to educating employees to avoid arrogance and continue to boost their enthusiasm and advance victoriously when production was going smoothly. Because the plan for the first quarter was completed ahead of schedule, some employees developed a complacent and relaxed mood at the beginning of the second quarter. In fact, at that time, there was a big problem to be solved in completing the water pump production task - insufficient working hours, which needed to be solved urgently. Through enlarged meetings of the Party committee, mass meetings, and forums, the Party committee presented tasks, favorable conditions, and difficulties to cadres and the masses, and universally carried out the education of "Strategically despise difficulties, and tactically pay attention to difficulties." Next, the Party committee put forward the fighting call of "Fight hard in the second quarter, complete the water pump task, support the agricultural bumper harvest, and present a gift to the Party's birthday" to all employees, boosting the greater enthusiasm of all employees in the factory. The employees of the metalworking workshop, the key workshop for producing water pumps, held a meeting to discuss the work of the workshop and found that there was a gap of more than 130,000 working hours between the actual working hours of the metalworking workshop and the working hours required for producing water pumps. The mood of slackening and resting immediately disappeared. Everyone brainstormed and tried to find ways to modify old lathes, improve the utilization rate of lathes, and carry out the "1,500 hours" movement (to increase the working hours of a lathe from 600 to 1,500 hours per month). At the same time, experienced master craftsmen led apprentices in shifts to make up for the shortage of technicians. As a result, the problem of working hours was solved. The Party committee, on the one hand, organized all workshops in the factory to promote the experience of the metalworking workshop, and on the other hand, organized all employees in the factory to carry out an increase production and save resources campaign centered on high output and high quality, comparing high output, high quality, enthusiasm, and more, faster, better, and more economically. The water pump production task for the second quarter was also completed ahead of schedule.

In the third quarter, the production task was large, the time was tight, there were many new products, and there was the threat of hot summer. Some employees developed new fears of difficulties. The Party committee, on the one hand, strengthened the work of preventing heatstroke and cooling down, and on the other hand, carried out political and ideological education for the workers, explaining the decisive role of completing the third quarter plan in the annual production and the political significance of presenting gifts to the National Day. All employees of the factory were full of fighting spirit and put forward rationalization proposals. The cooling work was quickly launched; the difficulties such as the large volume of the gears of the sugar pressing machine were overcome. The production plan for July was completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. In early August, the Party committee organized employees to study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Emotions and Strictly Practice Increasing Production and Saving Resources," carried out extensive airing of views, full-scale debates, and proposed a new fighting slogan of "Fight hard in August and September to welcome the National Day." This further boosted the enthusiasm of employees. Each workshop, team, and individual formulated leap forward plans and enthusiastically carried out labor competitions. In August, the factory again overfulfilled the production plan.

The publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party gave the factory's Party committee a more powerful ideological weapon. The Party committee organized all employees in the factory to earnestly study and discuss the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, and conducted a profound criticism of the right-leaning and slackening emotions of some employees, which made all employees full of more vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. Taking advantage of the momentum, the Party committee put forward the slogan of "Advance victoriously, fight hard in September, and present a generous gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," and organized a matching competition between workshops, teams, and individuals throughout the factory. A greater upsurge of increasing production and saving resources quickly arose throughout the factory. As a result, the factory completed the output value plan for the third quarter 37% ahead of schedule and completed more than 2,000 National Day gift projects. At the same time, the factory Party committee timely studied and arranged the work after the National Day and in the fourth quarter, and put forward the fighting slogan of "Fight hard in the fourth quarter and strive to complete the annual plan 40 days ahead of schedule and overfulfill it." All employees were well prepared ideologically. As soon as the National Day holiday was over, all workshops in the factory created a brilliant achievement of "a red start." By October 20, the factory had overfulfilled the plan every day.

    政治是经济工作的生命线
    南昌通用机械厂坚持政治挂帅天天超额完成生产计划
    本报讯　南昌通用机械厂党委不断对职工进行政治思想教育，使职工群众始终保持着旺盛的革命干劲，在设备陈旧、技术力量薄弱的情况下，今年九个月零二十天，月月、日日都超额完成了生产计划，总产值比去年同期增长一倍以上，成品率达到97％到99％。这一事实生动地说明：在工业战线上坚持政治挂帅，是实现生产大跃进的根本保证。
    南昌通用机械厂在去年大跃进中，全体职工苦干巧干，取得了很大成绩，总产值比1957年增长三倍以上。今年，这个厂按照国家计划的要求，在不增加设备和技术力量的条件下，总产值要比去年再翻一番，许多产品又是技术复杂、结构精密、体积庞大的新品种。这个厂的党委认为：越是在这种比较困难的情况下，越要政治挂帅，鼓足职工的革命干劲，发动群众去克服各种困难，才能保证完成国家计划。
    这个厂首先教育职工认清有利形势，树立必胜的信念，鼓起冲天的干劲。今年一开始，党委为了迎接行将下达的冶炼、轧钢、炼焦、电站和农业水泵等五大设备的生产加工任务，在发动群众进行生产准备的同时，深入了解和分析了当时的职工思想情况，发现有的职工存在着信心不足和畏难松劲情绪。党委组织干部和工人学习了党的八届六中全会决议和有关文件，通过鸣放辩论，引导职工明确认识了今年继续大跃进的政治和经济意义，认清当前的有利形势；同时，通过总结去年大跃进的成就和典型事例，批判了畏难松劲情绪。许多职工说：“去年成绩是大，但社会主义不是一年就能建成的，刚走好了第一步就要歇气，怎么行呢！”有些职工讨论了去年大跃进的成就和去年在一个星期内用简陋的设备制造出四百一十一台大型罗茨五号鼓风机的情况以后说：“想想去年，今年就来了劲。去年可以办到的，今年更能办到。”在这个基础上，党委立即组织了全厂职工的跃进誓师大会，响亮地提出了“再鼓干劲，齐争上游，确保产值翻一番，誓夺更大跃进红旗”的战斗口号，迅速掀起了生产高潮。许多看来难以克服的困难都顺利克服了。全厂提前十三天全面完成了第一季度的生产任务，总产值比去年同期增长五倍多。
    厂党委还注意在生产顺利的情况下，教育职工闻胜勿骄，继续鼓足干劲乘胜前进。由于第一季度提前完成了计划，一部分职工在第二季度开初产生了骄傲自满的松劲情绪。其实，当时要完成水泵生产任务，有一个很大的问题——工时不足，急需解决。党委通过党委扩大会、群众大会和座谈会等，向干部、群众摆任务，摆有利条件，摆困难，普遍开展了“在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难”的教育。接着，党委向全体职工提出了“大战二季度，完成水泵任务，支援农业大丰收，向党的生日献礼”的战斗号召，鼓起了全厂职工的更大干劲。生产水泵的重点车间金工车间的职工开会讨论了本车间的工作，发现金工车间实有工时与生产水泵所需工时相差十三万多个，松劲歇气情绪立即消除了。大家纷纷动脑筋，想办法，改装旧车床，提高车床的利用率，开展“千五台时”运动（使一台车床一个月工作的工时由六百个提高到一千五百个），同时由老师傅分班带领徒工上阵，弥补技工的不足。结果，工时问题解决了。党委一面组织全厂各车间推广金工车间的经验，一面组织全厂职工开展了以高产优质为中心的增产节约运动，比高产、比优质、比干劲、比多快好省。第二季度的水泵生产任务又提前完成了。
    第三季度生产任务大，时间紧，新产品多，面临着炎夏高温的威胁。某些职工又产生了新的畏难情绪。党委一面加强防暑降温工作，一面向工人进行政治思想教育，说明完成三季度计划对全年生产的决定性作用和向国庆节献礼的政治意义。全厂职工斗志昂扬，纷纷提合理化建议。降温工作迅速展开；制糖压榨机齿轮体积大等困难克服了。7月份的生产计划又提前超额完成。8月上旬，党委组织职工学习了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，提出了“大战8、9月，迎接国庆节”的新的战斗口号。这就进一步鼓舞了职工的干劲。各车间、各小组和个人都制订了跃进计划，热烈开展了劳动竞赛。8月份，全厂又超额完成了生产计划。
    党的八届八中全会文件的公布，给了这个厂的党委以更有力的思想武器。党委组织全厂职工认真学习和讨论了八中全会的文件，并对部分职工的右倾松劲情绪进行了深刻的批判，使全体职工鼓起了更加旺盛的革命干劲。党委“趁热打铁”提出了“乘胜前进，奋战9月，厚礼献给建国十周年”的口号，并在全厂组织了车间、小组、个人之间的对口赛。一个更大的增产节约高潮迅速在全厂兴起。结果，全厂提前七天超额37％完成了第三季度的产值计划，并且完成了两千多项国庆献礼项目。与此同时，厂党委及时研究和安排了国庆节后和第四季度的工作，提出了“大战四季度，力争提前四十天超额完成全年计划”的战斗口号。全体职工作好了思想准备。国庆节假日一过，全厂各车间就创造了“开门红”的辉煌战果。到10月20日，全厂日日超额完成了计划。
