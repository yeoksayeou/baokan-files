Great Leap Forward speed race rocket: Five-year journey completed in just over a year.
Power generating equipment output reaches 1962 target.

    (Our report) The staff and workers of the national electrical machinery manufacturing industry, opposing Rightist tendencies and encouraging greater effort, achieved a major victory in September. The output of power generating equipment in September was 298,000 kilowatts, an increase of 41.2% compared to August. From January to September, a total of 1,454,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment was produced, completing 80% of the annual plan. Thus, China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry has victoriously realized the call of the Party Central Committee, reaching the output target of the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan—1962—three years and three months ahead of schedule.

    In September, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry also trial-produced many significant new products, such as a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, a 2,500-kilowatt complete mobile train power station, a 60,000 kVA 220 kV power transformer, a 252 kHz 64-channel carrier communication cable, and so on. The creation of these significant new products powerfully demonstrates that the production technology of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry is continuously making a Great Leap Forward.

    The advance achievement of the 1962 target for power generating equipment output is a victory for the Party's General Line, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a victory for launching mass movements and major technological revolutions and innovations. Last year, the national electrical machinery manufacturing industry achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, with the output of power generating equipment increasing sharply from less than 200,000 kilowatts in 1957 to 800,000 kilowatts. This year, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry continues to make a Great Leap Forward. Especially after the publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, leading cadres of electrical machinery manufacturing plants across the country went to the front line of production, focusing on progress and measures, and many difficulties and key problems in production were quickly resolved. The broad masses of staff and workers were full of energy and enthusiasm, extensively carried out "competition between opponents," "relay races," "competition between the same types of work," and "competition between upstream and downstream processes" between workshops, production teams, vigorously carried out technical innovations, and promoted advanced experiences, which rapidly improved the level of production. When discussing the September plan, the staff and workers of the Shanghai Boiler Factory proposed more than 4,000 measures, focusing on key points and meticulously implementing measures, so that the mass movement developed vigorously and steadily. As a result, the factory completed its annual production task ahead of schedule at the end of September. Under the slogan of "Focus on quality, meticulous in every detail; focus on output, racing against every second," the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory saw a wave of mass movements centered on technological innovation rising higher and higher. The key to this factory's early completion of its annual production task was the heavy task of the turbine component—the diaphragm. One-third of the factory's workers formed 28 production commando teams to vigorously carry out technological innovations and fiercely attack this weak link. In just over a month, they produced diaphragms that used to take nearly three months to produce, ensuring that the annual plan was completed ahead of schedule at the end of September. The Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory and Steam Turbine Factory opposed Rightist tendencies, encouraged greater effort, vigorously launched mass movements, and promoted each other, advancing hand in hand. On September 27, they jointly achieved the 1962 production target ahead of schedule. Now, all the staff and workers of the electrical machinery industry are advancing victoriously, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.

    大跃进速度赛火箭　五年途程一年多走完
    发电设备产量达到1962年指标
    本报讯　全国电机制造工业部门的职工反右倾，鼓干劲，9月份取得重大胜利。发电设备的产量，9月份完成二十九点八万瓩，比8月份增长41.2％。1至9月份共生产发电设备一四五点四万瓩，完成年计划80％。至此，我国电机制造工业已经胜利地实现了党中央的号召，提前三年零三个月使发电设备的产量达到了第二个五年计划最后一年——1962年的指标。
    电机制造工业部门在9月份还试制出了不少重大的新产品，如五万瓩汽轮发电机，二千五百瓩成套移动式列车电站，六万千伏安二十二万伏电力变压器，二百五十二千周六十四路载波通讯电缆，等等。这些重大新产品的制成，有力地说明了我国电机制造工业的生产技术在不断大跃进。
    发电设备产量提前达到1962年的指标，是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，是大搞群众运动、大搞技术革命和技术革新的胜利。全国电机制造工业去年实现了空前大跃进，发电设备的产量由1957年的不到二十万瓩猛增到八十万瓩。今年，电机制造工业继续大跃进。特别在党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，全国电机制造工厂的领导干部亲临生产第一线，狠抓进度，狠抓措施，许多生产中的困难和关键问题迅速解决。广大职工干劲充沛，深入开展了车间之间、生产小组之间、同工种之间、上下工序之间的“对手对口赛”、“连环赛”，大搞技术革新，推广先进经验，使生产水平迅速提高。上海锅炉厂职工在讨论9月份计划时，提出了四千多条措施，抓紧关键，细抓措施，使群众运动既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实地向前发展。结果这个厂在9月底就提前完成了全年产量任务。上海汽轮机厂在“抓质量，一丝不苟，抓产量，分秒必争”的口号下，以技术革新为中心的群众运动一浪高过一浪。这个厂提前完成全年产量任务的关键，是汽轮机的部件——隔板任务大。全厂三分之一的工人，组成二十八个生产突击队，大搞技术革新，猛攻这一薄弱环节。仅仅一个多月的时间，就生产出了过去需要近三个月才能生产出的隔板，保证全年计划在9月底就提前完成了。哈尔滨电机厂和汽轮机厂反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，并且互相促进，携手跃进。9月27日，他们就共同提前达到了1962年的生产指标。现在，电机工业的全体职工正乘胜前进，力争提前全面完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。
