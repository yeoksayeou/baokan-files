According to Zhejiang Daily news: With the thorough implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses in rural Zhejiang is becoming increasingly high. An exciting and excellent situation of everyone striving to be advanced and red banners everywhere has emerged on the agricultural front. Local production victories continue to pour in. Agricultural production is continuing to leap forward with the force of ten thousand horses galloping!

    Opposing right-leaning opportunism is an important prerequisite for boosting morale, striving for the upstream, and continuing the Great Leap Forward. Various regions have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and have seriously criticized various right-leaning thoughts, thereby greatly encouraging the cadres and masses to continue the Great Leap Forward. Huangyan County recently thoroughly criticized the "advanced suffer losses" theory at a three-level cadre conference using the method of presenting facts and reasoning. The cadres attending the meeting believed that the saying "advanced suffer losses" is groundless. It is merely the clamor of wealthy peasants, a concrete reflection of their opposition to the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. Because some cadres harbor this extremely harmful thought, their determination to strive for the upstream has declined; if one does not strive for the upstream, one will inevitably fall to the middle or even downstream. By refuting the fallacy of "advanced suffer losses," the cadres and masses throughout the county have further boosted their morale and put forward the slogan of "Humbly learn from Qingtian, determined to surpass Qingtian, everyone strives to be number one." A comprehensive leap forward situation has emerged in various rural tasks throughout the county. Linhai County seriously criticized the ideas of "content with the middle stream," being complacent and self-satisfied, and not seeking progress at a three-level cadre conference. They launched a vigorous mass movement of "Learn from Shuanggang, catch up with Shuanggang, surpass Shuanggang." Cui Zhenhua, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Yan Rujing, the Secretary of the Secretariat, also led a group of cadres to learn from Huangyan and Xianju counties. Now, a production upsurge has generally appeared throughout the county. They are determined to advance victoriously, "October must be better than September, and each month will be redder than the last!"

    The emergence of a production upsurge is the result of vigorously carrying out mass movements. Various regions have generally established pacesetters and enthusiastically carried out socialist labor competitions, visiting the wise and learning from experience everywhere, a grand occasion unprecedented. Fenghua County went to Shaoxing three times and Xiangshan once. The county's communes competed with each other, and teams were linked together, greatly promoting current production. Grass seed sowing and rapeseed seedling cultivation were completed ahead of schedule before National Day, and other production tasks and various rural tasks were also carried out very well. Twelve communes in the suburbs of Ningbo City sent 1,250 people to visit and study at the Shaoxing Donghu Farm, a rice pacesetter unit in the Ningbo Special Zone. The city's grass seed sowing and rapeseed seedling cultivation were also completed by the end of September. After learning from the experience of Jinyun County in carrying out the "Learn from Shuangkeng" movement, Jiangshan County summarized the experience of the Victory Production Team of the Yutou Commune, which had the best production in the county, and launched a movement of "Learn from Victory, catch up with Victory, surpass Victory" throughout the county. Of the 313 production teams in the county, 250 teams have now caught up with and surpassed the Victory Production Team, and more than 6,600 "five-good" commune members have emerged. Current production is also in full swing.

    Under the glorious light of the General Line, various counties are continuing to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and strive for high-speed development of production, so that the production upsurge is getting higher and higher.

    According to Zhejiang Daily news: Huangyan County, Zhejiang, conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and thoroughly criticized the erroneous idea of the "advanced suffer losses" spread by a few peasants with capitalist ideas at the three-level cadre meeting. As a result, a lively situation has emerged in which the whole party is united from top to bottom, everyone is striving to be advanced, and everything is striving to be number one. After the advanced experience of Qingtian County was transmitted, it greatly encouraged the cadres and masses of the county, who unanimously expressed that they would learn from Qingtian, surpass Qingtian, and push the "red, diligent, and skillful" socialist competition movement to a greater climax, striving for number one in everything.

    The right-leaning thoughts of "the advanced suffer losses" and "content with the middle stream" existing among some cadres in Huangyan County have greatly affected the county's production. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, some cadres and masses are not striving for the upstream in their thinking, but are content with the middle or downstream. They relax leadership in their work and do not actively promote mass line work methods for leading production movements that have been effective in the Great Leap Forward. The meeting presented a large number of advanced examples, illustrating that being advanced does not "suffer losses" but has great benefits. For example, Jinqing Commune, due to the cadres' and commune members' sufficient enthusiasm, increased early rice production by 21%. Every team has sufficient food rations. After completing the state procurement tasks, 96% of the production teams still have surplus grain. Another example is the Huijiang Production Team of Chengjiang Commune. Because of the correct implementation of the production policy of taking grain as the key link, emphasizing both grain and livestock, comprehensively developing, and achieving comprehensive balance, production has increased year by year, and income has increased year by year. The total grain output in 1958 increased by 64% compared to 1952, citrus production increased by 156%, and pig raising increased by 705%. Other diversified economies have also developed greatly. In 1958, the income of each commune member household was more than 780 yuan. This year, the total early rice output increased by 24% compared to last year, and citrus production is also very good. It is estimated that each household can earn 1,200 yuan this year. After presenting these facts, everyone believed that being advanced has six major benefits: ① political honor; ② more production increase; ③ greater contribution to supporting national construction; ④ more income for commune members themselves; ⑤ good relationship between cadres and masses; ⑥ active in all tasks. At the same time, they believed that to thoroughly solve the contradiction between production not catching up with the improvement of living standards, it is necessary to boost morale and comprehensively develop production. It is wrong to require the state to reduce tasks and unilaterally emphasize reducing costs. At the same time, it also presented examples of production and commune members' economic losses due to the burden of "advanced suffer losses." The Xiacao Production Team of Chengjiang Commune believed that they had "suffered losses" because they sold 40,000 jin more grain due to increased production last year. They did not listen to the Party's words and did not accept advanced technical measures. As a result, the early rice unit yield this year decreased by 6% compared to last year. In the distribution in the first half of the year, each commune member household's income decreased by 20 yuan. After the comparison, the branch secretary shed tears and confessed: I was afraid that being advanced would "suffer losses." I did not believe in the leadership of the Party above, nor did I believe in the awareness of the masses below. I did not learn advanced experience, and my production enthusiasm was insufficient. I really suffered a great loss.

    On the basis of improving understanding, further analysis was made as to why this kind of thinking arose. Everyone believed that the "advanced suffer losses" thing does not exist at all. This is the clamor of some peasants with bourgeois ideas and a reflection of their opposition to the unified purchase and sale of grain and their unwillingness to accept advanced technology. Everyone unanimously agreed that it must be thoroughly criticized and those erroneous ideas must be resolutely corrected, and that efforts should be made to push production to a further climax. The county party committee itself also criticized the idea of "advanced suffer losses" existing in the county party committee, believing that this idea has a great impact on the county's production. Early rice production this year is already in the "middle stream," and this idea must be resolutely criticized and overcome.

    Through this study and discussion, everyone expressed that they must be consistent from top to bottom, united in one heart and one mind, united under the leadership of the Party committee, resolutely defend the General Line, and resolutely implement the Party's policies, resolutions, and tasks. Everyone further developed the spirit of doing whatever they say. For example, after the county party committee put forward the fighting call to fully realize the transformation of soft pig and cattle pens to hard pens in three days, although there was arduous and meticulous ideological work to be done, and a large number of materials (slate, bricks, yellow mud, clam ash) needed to be prepared, the party organizations at all levels and all cadres were full of confidence and resolutely implemented the call. For example, Comrade Mu Shunfa, deputy secretary of the Yuanqiao Commune Party Committee, personally carried slate in the mountains and set a good example. He convened an on-site meeting, and the entire commune quickly renovated more than 10,000 pig pens. Sanjia Commune is located along the coast, lacking slate and yellow mud. They organized more than 100 boats and mobilized more than 1,200 people to transport yellow mud from more than 20 miles away overnight. Now the task of renovating pig and cattle pens has been fully completed. The county has overfulfilled the nine tasks of expanding the planting of autumn vegetables and accumulating fertilizer, etc., put forward before National Day. The preparation for autumn harvest and winter planting has also been fully launched. The county has sown a batch of grass seeds and rapeseed. Fertilizer has been accumulated to a standard of 19.4 million dan, an average of 38 dan per mu. 215,500 pieces of large and small farm tools have been repaired, accounting for 81% of the number that should be repaired. 473 production teams have been arranged for labor organization, accounting for 67%.

    According to Zhejiang Daily news: Linhai County, Zhejiang, conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Under the slogan of reversing right-leaning thoughts and boosting revolutionary enthusiasm, it set fire to the idea of "content with the middle stream" and launched a vigorous mass-based autumn production increase and frugality competition. In the September campaign, it won fifteen "red banners" in sowing, late-stage management of late rice, and other tasks. Now, with a heroic spirit, it has put forward the fighting slogan of "Make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, October must be better than September, and each month will be redder than the last!" and launched a competition craze throughout the county of you chasing me, me catching up with you, everyone striving to be advanced, and red banners everywhere.

    After the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county party committee immediately organized the vast number of cadres and masses to study and carried out extensive publicity activities. In late September, the county party committee summarized a large number of deeds at the county party committee's enlarged meeting and the three-level cadre meeting, focusing on criticizing the "content with the middle stream" idea. This kind of thinking is manifested in being not as good as the upper level and more than enough than the lower level, and not being convinced by the advanced. For example, compared with Huangyan County, it is believed that Huangyan has good soil quality and good conditions, and it cannot compare; compared with Xianju County, it is not convinced by some of Xianju's advanced deeds. It is believed that the county is neither advanced nor backward in grain production, procurement, and completion of various tasks, and is somewhat complacent and self-satisfied. The atmosphere of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced is not strong between communes, and some are even unconvinced by the advanced pacesetters. Therefore, even with advanced pacesetters, they cannot bloom everywhere in the county. In order to overcome this "content with the middle stream" idea and strive for high-speed development of production, the county party committee summarized the typical example of Shuanggang Commune surpassing the plains in mountainous areas and achieving a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The commune's wheat yield per mu increased by 51% compared to last year, the barley yield per mu increased by 41%, the total rapeseed yield increased sevenfold, the early and mid-rice yield per mu increased by 36.5%, the soybean yield per mu increased by one time, the number of six livestock per household reached fourteen, including 2.49 pigs, the industrial output value increased threefold, and the silkworm cocoons increased twofold. At the same time, the procurement and transfer tasks of grain, live pigs, bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, tea, and other agricultural and sideline products have been overfulfilled. The meeting also introduced the advanced deeds of the Shuao Production Team of Datian Commune in running the commune diligently and frugally. Through debate, everyone consciously examined and criticized complacency, dissatisfaction, inferiority, and the lack of enthusiasm for advanced things. At the meeting, Liuao Commune, which had the same conditions as Shuanggang Commune and had always "contented itself with being downstream," proposed a competition to Shuanggang Commune, determined to "learn from Shuanggang, catch up with Shuanggang, surpass Shuanggang." Huayuan Commune, which was always advanced but is now behind Shuanggang, also proposed to strive for the upstream and surpass Shuanggang Commune in a short period of time. In this way, a competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced immediately formed. After the news spread, it immediately stirred up a response outside the meeting and quickly set off a production upsurge. During the meeting, the county party committee also organized more than 150 cadres above the brigade general branch secretary, led by Cui Zhenhua, the first secretary of the county party committee, and Yan Rujing, the secretary of the secretariat, to learn from Huangyan and Xianju respectively.

    Now, 320,000 people in the county are invested in the production battle every day. In the three days from October 1st to 3rd, more than 10 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated. Of the 1,078 production teams in the county, more than 800 teams have implemented winter planting plans to the fields. The county's spring flower and green manure area will increase by 170,000 to 180,000 mu compared to last year. The mass competition movement for striving for 1,000 jin of wheat, 500 jin of rapeseed, and 20,000 jin of grass seeds has also initially formed.

    浙江农村万马奔腾齐争大跃进
    “先进吃亏”论和“安居中游”思想受到严肃批判
    据浙江日报消息　随着党的八届八中全会精神的深入贯彻，浙江全省农村广大干部、群众的革命干劲愈来愈高涨，农业战线上出现了人人争先进、处处满堂红的令人兴奋的大好形势。各地生产捷报不断涌来。农业生产正以万马奔腾之势，继续向前大跃进！
    反对右倾机会主义，是鼓足干劲，力争上游，继续大跃进的一个重要前提。各地认真贯彻了八届八中全会决议的精神，对各种右倾思想进行了严肃的批判，从而大大地鼓舞了干部、群众继续大跃进的干劲。黄岩县最近在三级干部大会上用摆事实、讲道理的方法，彻底批判了“先进吃亏论”。到会干部认为，“先进吃亏”的说法是毫无根据的，这只是富裕农民的叫嚣，是他们反对总路线、大跃进的具体反映。由于部分干部存在这种极其有害的思想，力争上游的斗志便低落了；不是力争上游，就一定会退居中游甚至下游。反掉了“先进吃亏”的谬论，全县干部、群众就进一步鼓足干劲，提出了“虚心学青田，决心超青田，个个争第一”的口号，全县各项农村工作都出现了全面跃进的局面。临海县在三级干部大会上认真批判了比上不足、比下有余，自满自足，不求上进的“安居中游”思想，开展了轰轰烈烈的“学双港，赶双港，超双港”的群众运动。县委第一书记崔振华、书记处书记严汝京还带领一批干部，分别到黄岩、仙居两县取经。现在，生产高潮已在全县普遍出现，他们决心乘胜前进，“十月定要胜九月，一月更比一月红”！
    生产高潮的出现，是大搞群众运动的结果。各地普遍树立标兵，热烈开展社会主义劳动竞赛，到处访贤取经，盛况空前未有。奉化县三上绍兴，一下象山，全县社社竞赛，队队挂钩，大大推动了当前生产，草子播种、油菜育秧都已在国庆节前超额完成，其他各项生产、各项农村工作也都搞得很出色。宁波市郊区有十二个公社派出一千二百五十人到宁波专区的水稻标兵单位——绍兴东湖农场参观学习。全市草子播种、油菜育秧也都在9月底全部完成。江山县在学习缙云县开展学“双坑”运动的经验之后，总结了全县生产搞得最好的淤头公社胜利生产队的经验，在全县开展了“学胜利，赶胜利，超胜利”的运动。全县三百十三个生产队，现在已有二百五十个队赶上和超过了胜利生产队，涌现了六千六百多个“五好”社员，当前生产也搞得十分起劲。
    各县在总路线的光辉照耀下，正在继续反右倾，鼓干劲，力争高速度发展生产，使生产高潮愈来愈高。
    据浙江日报消息　浙江黄岩县认真贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，在三级干部会议上彻底批判了少数有资本主义思想的农民散布的“先进吃亏”论的错误思想。因而，出现了全党上下团结一致，个个争先进，样样争第一的你追我赶的生动局面。青田县的先进经验传来之后，对全县的干部和群众起了很大的鼓舞作用，一致表示要学习青田，超过青田，把“红、勤、巧”社会主义竞赛运动推向更大高潮，争取样样第一。
    黄岩县部分干部中存在的“先进吃亏论”和“甘居中游”的右倾思想，大大影响了全县的生产。由于这种思想的指导，部分干部、群众思想上不是力争上游，而是甘居中游或下游。在工作上放松领导，对大跃进中一些行之有效的领导生产运动的群众路线工作方法，也不积极推行。会上摆出大量先进典型，说明先进并不“吃亏”，而是有很大好处。例如金清公社，由于干部、社员干劲足，早稻增产21％，队队口粮留足，完成了国家征购任务后，还有96％的生产队有余粮。又如澄江公社汇江生产队，由于正确执行以粮为纲，粮畜并重，全面发展，综合平衡的生产方针，生产年年提高，收入年年增加，粮食总产量1958年比1952年增加64％，柑桔增产156％，生猪增加705％，其他多种经济也有很大发展，1958年每户社员收入七百八十多元，今年早稻总产量比去年增加24％，柑桔生产也很好，预计今年每户可收入一千二百元。摆出这些事实后，大家认为先进有六大好处：①政治上光荣；②增产多；③支援国家建设贡献大；④社员自己收入多；⑤干部、群众关系好；⑥各项工作主动。同时认为要彻底解决生产赶不上生活水平提高的矛盾，只有鼓足干劲，全面发展生产。要求国家减少任务，片面强调降低成本，都是不对的。同时，也摆出了由于背了“先进吃亏”的包袱，使生产上与社员经济上受到损失的典型。澄江公社的下曹生产队，由于去年增产，多售了四万斤粮食，就认为“吃亏”了，不听党的话，不接受先进技术措施，结果今年早稻单位产量比去年减少6％，上半年分配中，社员每户收入减少二十元。对比以后，支部书记掉下眼泪检讨说：我怕先进“吃亏”，上不相信党的领导，下不相信群众的觉悟，先进经验不学习，生产干劲不足，真正吃了大亏。
    在提高认识的基础上，进一步分析了为什么会产生这种思想。大家认为“先进吃亏”的事情是根本不存在的。这是一部分有资产阶级思想的农民的叫嚣，是他们反对粮食统购包销、不愿接受先进技术的思想反映。大家一致认为必须彻底批判，坚决改正那些错误的思想，鼓足干劲，把生产进一步推向高潮。县委本身也批判了县委存在的“先进吃亏”的思想，认为这个思想对本县生产影响很大，今年早稻生产已处于“中游”，必须坚决批判克服这种思想。
    通过这次学习、讨论，大家表示一定要上下一致，同心同德，团结在党委的领导下，坚决保卫总路线，坚决执行党的方针政策、决议和任务。大家进一步发扬了说干就干的精神，例如县委提出了三天全部实现猪牛栏软栏改硬栏的战斗号召后，尽管有艰苦细致的思想工作要做，大量的物资（石板、砖块、黄泥、蜊灰）需要准备，可是各级党组织、全体干部都满怀信心，坚决执行。如院桥公社党委副书记牟顺法同志亲自到山里抬石板，做好样子，召开现场会议，全公社迅速改好了一万多个猪栏。三甲公社地处沿海，缺石板、缺黄泥，他们就组织了一百多条船，发动了一千二百多个人连夜到二十多里路外运黄泥，现在改建猪牛栏的任务已全部完成。全县在国庆前提出的扩种秋菜、积肥等九项任务均已超额完成。秋收冬种准备也已全面展开。全县已播下一批草子、油菜。肥料已积标准肥一千九百四十万担，每亩平均三十八担。已修大小农具二十一万五千件，占应修数的81％。劳动组织已安排好的有四百七十三个生产队，占67％。
    据浙江日报消息　浙江临海县广大干部认真贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议，在反掉右倾思想、鼓足革命干劲的口号下，火烧“安居中游”的思想，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性的秋季增产节约竞赛运动，在9月大战中，夺得了播种、晚稻后期管理等十五个满堂红。现在又以豪迈的气概，提出了“再接再厉，乘胜前进，十月定要胜九月，一月更比一月红”的战斗口号，在全县范围内掀起了你追我，我赶你，人人争先进，处处满堂红的竞赛热潮。
    党的八届八中全会文件公布后，县委立即组织广大干部、群众进行了学习，大张旗鼓地开展宣传活动。9月下旬，县委在县委扩大会议和三级干部会议上，总结了大量的事迹，重点批判了“安居中游”思想。这种思想表现为比上不足、比下有余，对先进不服气。例如和黄岩县比，认为黄岩土质好、条件好，比不上；和仙居县比，又对仙居的一些先进事迹不服气。认为全县在粮食生产、征购和在完成各项任务中，既不先进，也不落后，有点自满自足。公社与公社之间，学先进、赶先进、超先进的空气也不浓厚，有的甚至对先进标兵不服气。因此，有了先进标兵，也不能在全县普遍开花。为了克服这种“安居中游”的思想，力争高速度发展生产，县委总结了双港公社山区超平原，样样大跃进的典型。这个公社的小麦亩产比去年增加51％，大麦亩产增加41％，油菜籽总产量增加七倍，早、中稻亩产增加36.5％，黄豆亩产增加一倍，六畜每户达十四只，其中猪二点四九头，工业产值增加三倍，蚕茧增加二倍。同时，粮食、生猪、竹木柴炭、茶叶和其它农副产品的征购、上调任务都已超额完成。会上还介绍了大田公社鼠岙生产队勤俭办社的先进事迹。通过辩论，大家都自觉地检查与批判了自满自足、不服气和自卑情绪，以及对待先进事物缺乏热情的原因。会上，与双港公社条件相同、一向“甘居下游”的六岙公社向双港公社提出竞赛，决心“学双港，赶双港，超双港”。一向先进而现在落在双港后面的花园公社，也提出要力争上游，在短时间内超过双港公社。就这样，一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛高潮立即形成。消息传开后，会外立即奋起响应，迅速掀起了生产高潮。在会议期间，县委还组织大队总支书记以上干部一百五十多人，由县委第一书记崔振华、书记处书记严汝京带领，分别到黄岩、仙居取经。
    现在，全县每天有三十二万人投入生产战斗。10月1日到3日的三天中就积肥一千多万担，全县一千零七十八个生产队，已有八百多个队的冬种规划落实到丘。全县春花、绿肥面积将比去年增加十七万到十八万亩。力争千斤麦、五百斤油菜籽、二万斤草子的群众竞赛运动也已初步形成。
