    Unveiling a New Chapter in Astronomical Science
    Chinese Scientists Discuss the Achievements of the Soviet Union's Launch of a Cosmic Rocket

    Xinhua News Agency, October 5th – Scientists in China's capital are celebrating the Soviet Union's launch of a third cosmic rocket carrying an automatic interplanetary station. Scientists spoke enthusiastically about the significant scientific achievements of the Soviet Union in launching this cosmic rocket.

    Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket hit the moon, and the third cosmic rocket is designed to bypass the far side of the moon at a distance of 10,000 kilometers and then return to the vicinity of the Earth. To achieve these goals, although it is not yet necessary to use reverse rocket power to brake and reduce the speed when the rocket approaches the moon, it is essential that the rocket has a very accurate direction and speed at the time the last stage rocket stops, that is, at the beginning of the free flight phase. To this end, the second and third cosmic rockets of the Soviet Union have controllable direction and overcoming last stages, which means precise control of a high-speed flying object at a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers from the launch point, with the speed accurate to one or two ten-thousandths. Therefore, the successful launch of the second and third cosmic rockets demonstrates that Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers have reached a new peak in remote measurement and remote control technology and have reached a new stage in the entire rocket technology. He also said that this is the Soviet Union's scientific and technological workers and the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, advancing from victory to greater victory on the road to the cosmos.

    Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: It has been less than a month since the Soviet Union successfully launched a lunar rocket, and now it has successfully launched a cosmic rocket orbiting the moon. Through the television equipment in the interplanetary station, we can photograph the far side of the moon, which we have never seen before, which is of great significance for studying the surface structure of the moon. The Soviet Union's repeated successful launches of lunar-hitting rockets and cosmic rockets orbiting the moon indicate that Soviet science has made great progress in automatic control, radio communication transmission, and telemetry technology. With such a high level of science and technology, it is entirely believable that they can launch cosmic rockets into any designated orbit, which indeed marks a new stage in conquering the universe. The abundant power supply of the interplanetary station and radio transmission equipment will collect scientific data from interstellar space more extensively. According to the information released by the Soviet Union, the orbit of this rocket will allow us to receive these scientific signals when the interplanetary station approaches the Earth, which is also a new innovation in high-altitude detection technology. He said that the constant stream of inspiring scientific innovations from the Soviet Union makes people more convinced of the superiority of the socialist system.

    Cheng Maolan, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Beijing Observatory, said: The successful launch of these giant rockets by the Soviet Union has opened a new era for mankind's conquest of the universe and has also unveiled a new chapter in astronomical science, marking a great epoch-making achievement of Soviet science and technology. The automatic interplanetary station sent up by this cosmic rocket will, for the first time, photograph the far side of the moon, which mankind has never seen before in history. The information obtained by the automatic interplanetary station will further provide more powerful assistance for the conquest of the moon and interstellar navigation. We can fully expect that in the near future, we humans will be able to personally go to other planets, which is of decisive significance for solving problems such as the structure of the universe and the origin and evolution of celestial bodies. He said that undoubtedly, this great achievement of the Soviet Union demonstrates the strength of the peace forces of our socialist camp, which will further guarantee world peace.

    Lu Yuanjiu, a researcher at the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: In the past two years, the Soviet Union has launched three Earth satellites and three cosmic rockets, and the third cosmic rocket is also equipped with an automatic interplanetary station. This shows that in just two years, Soviet science and technology has made amazing progress, and it also shows that the Soviet Union has entered an era of planned conquest of outer space. Sending a rocket into a predetermined orbit requires strict control of the rocket's speed and direction of movement. When launching Earth satellites, the speed control error is generally no more than 50 meters per second, that is, an accuracy of six thousandths, while when launching lunar rockets, the speed control error is no more than 3 meters per second, that is, about two ten-thousandths. When launching Earth satellites, the error in the direction of movement is no more than one degree, while when launching lunar rockets, the error in the direction of movement is no more than 0.1 degrees. And when launching automatic interplanetary stations orbiting the moon and Earth, the accuracy of control must be further improved. Therefore, in the past two years, the accuracy of the Soviet rocket automatic control system has increased by at least tenfold. This high-precision automatic control system requires the comprehensive application of many new achievements in scientific and technological fields, including automatic control theory, new control components, navigation equipment, radio measurement, radio communication, precision machinery, and semiconductor computers. He said that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third cosmic lunar rocket and automatic interplanetary station marks that the Soviet Union has greatly left capitalist America behind in many scientific fields.

    揭开天文科学新的一章
    我国科学界人士谈苏联发射宇宙火箭的成就
    新华社5日讯　我国首都科学界人士欢庆苏联发射了带有自动行星际站的第三个宇宙火箭。科学家们热烈地谈到了苏联在发射这个宇宙火箭中的科学方面的重大成就。
    中国科学院力学研究所所长钱学森说：苏联第二个宇宙火箭打中了月球，第三个宇宙火箭是要在距月球的一万公里的地方绕过月球背面，再回到地球附近来，要能做到这些事虽然还不需要火箭接近月球时候用反向火箭动力来刹车，减低飞行速度，但是必需在最后一级火箭停车时候，也就是在自由飞行阶段开始的时候，火箭具有非常准确的方向和速度。为此，苏联的第二个宇宙火箭和第三个宇宙火箭都具有可控制方向和克服的最后一级，这就意味着在距发射点一千公里以外的地方来精确地控制一个高速飞行体，速度得准到万分之一、二。所以第二个宇宙火箭和第三个宇宙火箭的发射成功，说明了苏联的科学家、工程师和工人登上了遥远测量和遥远控制技术中的新高峰，在整个火箭技术方面到达了一个新的阶段。他又说，这是苏联的科学技术工作者和苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在通往宇宙的大道上，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长赵九章说：苏联成功地发射月球火箭，还不到一个月的时间，现在又成功发射了一个围绕月球的宇宙火箭。通过行星际站中的电视装备，可以拍摄我们从来没有见到的月球的背，这对于研究月球的表面结构是有很大意义的。苏联一再成功发射命中月球，以及围绕月球的宇宙火箭，标志着苏联科学在自动控制、无线电讯传送、遥测技术等方面有了极大的进展，有了这样的高度科学技术水平，完全可以相信他们已经能把宇宙火箭发射到任意指定的轨道上去，这对于征服宇宙的确是进入了一个新的阶段。行星际站电源的充沛和无线电传送设备等装置，将更广泛地收集到星际空间的科学资料。按照苏联公报发的资料，这次火箭的轨道可以使我们在行星际站接近地球的时候收到这些科学的信号，这在高空探测技术上也是新的创举。他说，从苏联方面不断地传来令人振奋人心的科学创举，使人们更坚信社会主义制度的优越性。
    北京天文台筹备处主任程茂兰说：苏联成功地发射了这些巨型火箭，开创了人类征服宇宙的新纪元，也揭开了天文科学的新的一章，标志着苏联科学技术划时代的伟大成就。这个宇宙火箭所发送上去的自动行星际站将第一次拍下月球有史以来人类从未见到过的月球另一面。自动行星际站所获得的资料将进一步地对征服月球和星际航行提供更有力的帮助。我们完全可以预料在不久的将来我们人类定能亲自到别的星球上去，这对于解决宇宙构造、天体的起源和演化等问题有着决定性的意义。他说，无疑地苏联这个伟大的成就显示出我们社会主义阵营和平力量的强大，从而世界和平将更有保障。
    中国科学院自动化研究所研究员陆元九说：两年来苏联发射了三个地球卫星，三个宇宙火箭，而在第三个宇宙火箭上还安装有一个自动行星际站。这表明在短短的两年内苏联科学技术方面又有着惊人的进展，亦表明苏联已经进入有计划的征服宇宙空间的时代了。把火箭送入预定轨道，需要严格的控制火箭的速度及运动的方向。发射地球卫星时，速度的控制误差，一般不超过每秒五十米，即千分之六的准确度，而发射月球火箭时，速度的控制误差不超过每秒三米，即万分之二左右。发射地球卫星时，运动方向的误差不超过一度，而发射月球火箭时，运动方向的误差不超过零点一度。而发射围绕月球及地球的自动行星际站时，控制的精度还要提高。所以两年来，苏联火箭自动控制系统的精确度至少提高十倍。在这种高精度的自动控制系统中要综合采用许多科学及技术部分的新成就，这包括自动控制理论、新型控制元件、导航设备、无线电测量、无线电通讯、精密机械、半导体计算机等。他说，苏联第三个宇宙月球火箭及自动行星际站的成功发射，标志着苏联在许许多多科学领域方面把资本主义美国大大地抛在后面了。
