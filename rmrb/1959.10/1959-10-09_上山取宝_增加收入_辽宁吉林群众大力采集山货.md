　　Going Up the Mountains to Gather Treasures, Increasing Income
　　Liaoning and Jilin Masses Vigorously Collect Mountain Products
　　(Our report) During the autumn harvest in Liaoning Province, various regions are fighting on two fronts, simultaneously harvesting crops and collecting mountain goods and wild fruits.

　　This year, mountain pears, wild grapes, hazelnuts, yuan dates, hawthorns, crabapples, mushrooms, walnuts, and other mountain products have seen unprecedented harvests in the mountainous areas of Liaoning. Suizhong, the main pear-producing area, harvested 36,000 tons in 1957, a bumper year, while this year's estimated production is over 50,000 tons, an increase of approximately 40% compared to 1957. Dalian City has already collected more than 350,000 jin of mountain pears and more than 105,000 jin of yuan dates. Kuandian County estimates that it will harvest 16 million jin of mountain fruits this year, and has already collected 12.5 million jin.

　　Currently, vehicles and people are transporting mountain products from the mountainous areas to railway lines and purchasing departments; the traffic is constant and bustling.

　　In order to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops and mountain wild fruits, various regions generally arrange for the main labor force to engage in the autumn harvest, and organize women and students to collect mountain products in their spare time. In Fengcheng County, when pears, fruits and hazelnuts were ripening in large quantities, many production teams used the gap before the autumn harvest to give commune members two days off to rush-harvest more than 4.55 million jin of mountain fruits. In order to achieve a bumper harvest, various regions, in addition to organizing the timely supply of the harvested good fruits to the market, are also vigorously organizing processing. Kuandian County's communes have opened more than 60 wineries, producing more than 244,000 jin of wine.

　　The people's communes have demonstrated tremendous superiority in this year's autumn harvest. Not only is the autumn crop harvesting progressing quickly and with good quality, but also great achievements have been made in the collection of mountain goods and wild fruits. Liaoyang City has already earned more than 583,000 yuan. Luanjia Commune collected more than 100,000 jin of hazelnuts, with the highest income for a single commune member reaching more than 130 yuan. Many communes, by vigorously collecting mountain goods and wild fruits and developing diversified operations, will increase commune members' income by 50% to 100% compared to 1958, laying a material foundation for improving commune members' lives and for continuing the Great Leap Forward in production next year. Due to the bumper harvests of apples, pears, and mountain wild fruits, various regions have strengthened the transportation of fruits to prevent frost damage.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: While carrying out the agricultural "over-production quota" movement, people's communes in various parts of Jilin Province have transferred a large number of manpower and livestock to launch a mass movement to collect and purchase agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. According to statistics as of September 28, the total purchase amount of agricultural and sideline local products in the province has reached 100,859,200 yuan, completing 57.9% of the procurement task for the second half of the year, an increase of 29.2% over the same period last year.

　　Since the beginning of autumn, various wild plants in Jilin Province, from the eastern mountainous areas to the western grasslands, have generally had bumper harvests. Wild grapes and various fruits in the mountainous areas are bearing heavily, hanging full on the branches. The wild grass and reeds on the grasslands are particularly lush, and a large number of medicinal materials are found everywhere. In order to fully collect wild plants, without losing any small-scale sideline businesses, the people's communes in various regions have given full play to the superiority of large organizational scale and wide range of activities. They have uniformly arranged production and labor, organized a sideline force of 1,180,000 people, and launched a competition in sideline production between regions, counties, communes, production teams, and individuals, comparing enthusiasm, measures, quantity, quality, progress, and safety under the slogan of finding raw materials for industry, finding sources of goods for commerce, creating wealth for the country, increasing accumulation for the commune, and increasing income for commune members. By mid-September, various regions, taking advantage of the gap between the end of autumn field management and the beginning of the autumn harvest, launched another mass assault. At present, the province has collected more than 2 million tons of various wild plants.

　　In order to guide the smooth development of the mass sideline production movement in a timely and effective manner, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee convened a telephone conference. Various cities and counties have strengthened specific leadership, organized a large number of cadres to enter the mountains and grasslands to survey resources, and led the masses to fight together.

    上山取宝　增加收入
    辽宁吉林群众大力采集山货
    本报讯　辽宁省在秋收中，各地分两路兵马进行战斗，一面收割庄稼，一面采收山货野果。
    今年辽宁山区出产的山梨、山葡萄、榛子、元枣、山楂、山里红、蘑菇、核桃等山货获得空前丰收。主产梨果区绥中，1957年大年收获三万六千吨，而今年预计可产五万多吨，比1957年提高40％左右。旅大市已采收山梨三十五万多斤，元枣十万五千多斤。宽甸县预计今年能收山果一千六百万斤，目前已采收一千二百五十万斤。
    目前，各地车辆人马正由山区向铁路沿线和收购部门运输山货，每天车水马龙，络绎不绝。
    各地为了大秋作物和山货野果获得全面大丰收，一般都安排主要劳力投入秋收，组织妇女学生利用业余时间采收山货。凤城县在梨果榛子大量成熟时期，很多生产队都利用秋收前的空隙给社员放两天假，突击抢收山果达四百五十多万斤。各地为了作到丰产丰收，除了将采收的好果及时组织供应市场外，并大力组织加工。宽甸县各公社已开办六十多处造酒厂，已造酒二十四万四千多斤。
    人民公社在今年秋收中发挥了巨大优越性，不仅大秋作物收割进度快，质量好，在采收山货野果方面也获得很大成就。辽阳市目前已收入五十八万三千多元，栾家公社采收十万多斤榛子，最多一户社员收入一百三十多元。许多公社由于大力采收山货野果开展多种经营生产，社员收入将比1958年增加半倍到一倍以上，对提高社员生活和为明年生产继续大跃进，都打下了物质基础。由于苹果、梨及山货野果获得大丰收，各地都加强对水果的运输工作，防止遭受霜冻损失。
    据新华社长春讯　吉林省各地人民公社在农业超包产运动的同时，抽调大批人力、畜力，掀起了一个群众性的农、副、土、特产品的采集和收购运动。到9月28日的统计，全省农副土特产品的收购总额已达一亿零八十五万九千多元，完成下半年采购任务的57.9％，比去年同时期增加29.2％。
    入秋以来，吉林省从东部山区到西部草原，各种野生植物普遍丰收。山区的野葡萄和各种果品结实累累，挂满枝头。草原上的洋草、芦苇特别繁茂，大宗药材遍地皆是。为了把野生植物完全采集到手，小宗副业样样不丢，各地人民公社充分发挥了组织规模大，活动范围广的优越性，统一安排了生产和劳动力，组织了一百十八万人的副业大军，在为工业找原料，为商业找货源，为国家创造财富，为公社增加积累，为社员增加收入的口号下，掀起了地区与地区、县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队、人与人之间以比干劲、比措施、比数量、比质量、比进度、比安全为内容的副业生产竞赛。到9月中旬，各地乘秋田管理结束、秋收尚未开始的间隙，又开展了一次群众性的大突击。目前，全省采集的各种野生植物已达二百多万吨。
    为了及时有力地指导群众性副业生产运动顺利开展，中共吉林省委和省人民委员会曾召开了电话会议，各市、县都加强了具体领导，并且组织大批干部进山进草原勘察资源，领导群众一起奋战。
