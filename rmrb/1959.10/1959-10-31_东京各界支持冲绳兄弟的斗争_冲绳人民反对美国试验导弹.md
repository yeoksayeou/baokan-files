    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th. According to the "Okinawa Times," the Okinawa Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs recently decided to launch a large-scale campaign to oppose the United States conducting tests of "Nike" missiles on Okinawa Island, accusing it of preparing for nuclear war.
    According to the resolution passed by the council, a large-scale mass rally will be held at the launch site in Yomitan Village, north of Naha, to prevent the missile launch plan, and marches will be organized from villages, towns, and cities to Yomitan. The council also decided to call on fishermen to unite in the struggle against this plan.
    If the United States disregards strong public protests and forcibly conducts the tests, a hunger strike will be held at the launch site.
    Meanwhile, in Tokyo, representatives of twelve political parties and mass organizations held a meeting on the 28th and decided to immediately launch a campaign to oppose the testing of "Nike" missiles.
    The meeting decided to request the ongoing extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet and local assemblies to protest to the US and Japanese governments and to encourage the people of Okinawa Island to fight against missile testing. (Attached picture)
    The Okinawan people are engaged in an unyielding struggle against the US military authorities and the Japanese government, which is subservient to the United States. The slogan on the flag in the picture is: "Defend the Motherland! Defend Okinawa!"

    东京各界支持冲绳兄弟的斗争
    冲绳人民反对美国试验导弹
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：据“冲绳时报”报道，冲绳禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会最近决定开展大规模的运动来反对美国在冲绳岛进行发射“奈克”式导弹的试验，指责这是准备核战争。
    根据协议会通过的决议，将在那霸以北读谷村的发射地点举行大规模的群众集会来阻止导弹发射计划，并且将组织从乡村、市镇和城市到读谷去的游行。协议会还决定号召渔民联合进行斗争来反对这个计划。
    如果美国不顾公众的强烈抗议，强行进行试验，那末将在发射场举行绝食斗争。
    同时，在东京，十二个政党和群众组织的代表28日举行会议，决定立即开展运动来反对发射“奈克”式导弹的试验。
    会议决定要求正在举行的日本国会临时会议和地方议会向美国和日本政府提出抗议，并且鼓励冲绳岛人民进行反对导弹试验的斗争。（附图片）
