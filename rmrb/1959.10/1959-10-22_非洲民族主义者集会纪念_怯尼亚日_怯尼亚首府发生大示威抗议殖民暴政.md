Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th - African nationalists in Cairo gathered tonight to commemorate "Kenya Day," protesting British colonial rule in Kenya.

Seven years ago today, British colonialists declared a "state of emergency" in Kenya, which has not yet been lifted.

Ambiiso, Secretary of the Kenya African Association office in Cairo, reviewed the struggle of the Kenyan people over the past seven years and shouted the motto of Kenyan nationalists: "Always forward, never backward!"

He told those attending the meeting that due to various abuses suffered over the past seven years, Kenyan nationalist movement leader Kenyatta is said to be on his deathbed in Lodwar, the desert where he has been exiled, six days ago.

Ambiiso called on Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people and governments around the world to support the Kenyan national independence movement.

Speakers at the meeting also included Sibai, Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, John Keir, representative of Ugandan nationalists, Alis, representative of Cameroonian nationalists, Abdul Aziz Ishaq, Secretary-General of the African Association, and Mohammed Hamad Mahmoud, representative of the United Arab Republic National Union. The speakers expressed their support for the cause of Kenyan independence and praised the struggle of the Kenyan people.

The conference passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to the state of emergency in Kenya; permission for the Kenya Independence Movement Party to register; the unconditional and immediate release of Kenyatta; the opening of the Kenyan Highlands, currently exclusively occupied by white immigrants, to African residents; allowing Kenya to become autonomous next year, and the swift withdrawal of British military bases.

The conference also sent telegrams to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the British Governor of Kenya, and the British Colonial Secretary, protesting colonial oppression in Kenya.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - Nairobi News: In Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, about four thousand Africans demonstrated in front of the court on the morning of the 20th to protest the British colonial authorities' trial of six Kenyan African members of parliament, including Kenya Independence Movement Party leaders Odinga and Mboya.

It is reported that these six African members of parliament planned to hold a mass demonstration in front of the colonial government on "Kenya Day," October 20th, to demand the lifting of the "state of emergency" in Kenya and the immediate release of Kenyan African leader Kenyatta. The colonial authorities therefore accused them of "attempting to disrupt peace" and persecuted them.

October 20th marks the seventh anniversary of the British colonialists' declaration of a "state of emergency" in Kenya. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Council declared this day as "Kenya Day" in February this year to express support for the Kenyan people's struggle for freedom and independence.

The colonial court, intimidated by the momentum of the African demonstration, released the five African members of parliament being tried, but still sentenced Mboya to sign a promissory note for one hundred pounds, guaranteeing "no trouble" within three months. The execution of this sentence was suspended pending appeal. When these African members of parliament walked out of the court, the demonstrating crowd shouted "Freedom" to them and sang nationalist songs.

Police wearing steel helmets used clubs and other weapons to attack the demonstrators six times on this day, injuring some Africans and arresting others.

It is reported that while the colonial authorities were trying the African members of parliament, thirty-two African representatives from all over Kenya held a meeting in Nairobi. The representatives unanimously passed a petition to Walter Coutts, the acting Governor of Kenya, which demanded the immediate declaration of an end to the "state of emergency," the release of Kenyatta and other arrested African leaders, and condemned the court's trial of the six African members of parliament. While six representatives were on their way to the colonial government to deliver the petition, three of the representatives were arrested by the police.

The colonial authorities had declared the day the "state of emergency" was implemented as a "special day." On this day, Africans were not allowed to use transportation, nor were they allowed to smoke or drink alcohol. On the 20th, the colonial authorities also dispatched armored vehicles and a large number of police officers to patrol the streets of Nairobi, ready to suppress Africans demanding freedom at any time.

    非洲民族主义者集会纪念“怯尼亚日”
    怯尼亚首府发生大示威抗议殖民暴政
    新华社开罗20日电　在开罗的非洲民族主义者今晚集会纪念“怯尼亚日”，抗议英国在怯尼亚的殖民统治。
    七年前的今天，英国殖民者在怯尼亚宣布了“紧急状态”，一直到现在还未取消。
    怯尼亚非洲人协会驻开罗办事处秘书安比索在会上回顾了怯尼亚人民在过去七年中所进行的斗争，并且高呼怯尼亚民族主义者的座右铭：“永远前进，决不退后”！
    他对参加集会的人们说，由于过去七年中受到种种虐待，据说怯尼亚民族运动领袖肯雅塔六天前在他被流放的荒漠的洛德瓦尔已经奄奄一息。
    安比索呼吁亚非国家和全世界爱好和平的各国人民和政府支持怯尼亚的民族独立运动。
    在大会上讲话的还有亚非人民团结理事会总书记西巴伊、乌干达民族主义者代表约翰·凯耳、喀麦隆民族主义者代表阿利斯、非洲人协会总书记阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·伊沙克和阿联民族联盟的代表穆罕默德·哈马德·马哈茂德。发言者表示支持怯尼亚的独立事业，并且赞扬怯尼亚人民的斗争。
    大会通过决议，要求立即结束怯尼亚的紧急状态；准许怯尼亚独立运动党登记；无条件地立即释放肯雅塔；向非洲居民开放现为白种移民独占的怯尼亚高地；让怯尼亚在明年自治，并且迅速撤销英国的军事基地。
    大会还致电联合国大会主席、英国在怯尼亚的总督和英国殖民大臣，抗议在怯尼亚的殖民压迫。
    新华社21日讯　内罗毕消息：在怯尼亚首府内罗毕，20日上午大约有四千名非洲人在法院门前举行示威，抗议英国殖民当局审讯六位怯尼亚非洲人议员，其中包括怯尼亚独立运动党领袖奥廷加和姆博亚。
    据报道，这六位非洲人议员计划在10月20日“怯尼亚日”，在殖民政府门前举行群众示威游行，要求取消在怯尼亚的“紧急状态”和立即释放怯尼亚非洲人领袖肯雅塔。殖民当局因而指控他们“企图破坏和平”，加以迫害。
    10月20日是英国殖民者在怯尼亚宣布“紧急状态”七周年的日子，亚非人民团结理事会曾在今年2月宣布这一天为“怯尼亚日”，以表示支持怯尼亚人民争取自由和独立的斗争。
    殖民者法院慑于非洲人示威的声势，释放了被审讯的五位非洲人议员，但仍然判处姆博亚签署一张一百英镑的期票，保证三个月内“不肇事”，这项判决在上诉期间暂缓执行。当这些非洲人议员走出法院时，示威的群众向他们高呼“自由”，并高唱民族主义的歌曲。
    头戴钢盔的警察在这一天用棍棒等武器对示威者进行了六次袭击，有一些非洲人受伤，还有一些人被捕。
  据报道，当殖民当局正在审讯非洲人议员时，来自怯尼亚各地的三十二名非洲人代表在内罗毕举行会议，代表们一致通过一份给怯尼亚代理总督华尔特·考茨的请愿书，其中要求立即宣布结束“紧急状态”、释放肯雅塔和其他被捕的非洲人领袖，并谴责法院审讯六位非洲人议员。当六名代表前往殖民政府送交请愿书途中，有三名代表被警察逮捕。
    殖民当局曾宣布，“紧急状态”施行日为“特别日”。在这一天，非洲人不得使用交通工具，也不得抽烟和喝酒。20日，殖民当局还派出了装甲车和大批警察在内罗毕街头巡逻，随时准备镇压要求自由的非洲人。
