According to the Henan Daily, based on harvested and predicted results, the average yield of sweet potatoes in Henan Province's 18 million mu of land is expected to reach over 767 jin (converted to grain), an increase of more than 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

This year, Henan Province overcame a severe drought, and the harvested sweet potatoes have all achieved a bumper harvest, with a good harvest also expected for those yet to be harvested. Kaifeng Special District has planted a total of 5 million mu of sweet potatoes, of which 490,000 mu have been harvested, with an average yield of 880 jin (converted to grain). There are 630,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes, with an estimated yield of 5,402 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per mu. In Huaiyang County, 70,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes have been harvested, with an average yield of 1,224 jin (converted to grain). In Taikang County, 36,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been harvested, with an average yield of 1,250 jin (converted to grain). In six counties, including Ningling, Xiayi, and Weishi, the sweet potato yield is expected to exceed 1,000 jin (converted to grain). High-yield plots and fields with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu have also appeared in various places. In Taqiao People's Commune in Shangcai County, there are 3,382 mu of high-yield sweet potato plots, with a single-yield that can reach 15,000 jin. In the Luji Brigade of Huaiyang County, a two-mu high-yield field, according to the digging and inspection of plants, large plants yielded 23 jin each, and general plants yielded 14 jin each, with a single-yield that can reach more than 39,000 jin.

At present, the sweet potato harvest season is approaching, and all localities are learning from last year's experiences and lessons, and have made specific arrangements for the harvesting, storage, and processing of sweet potatoes. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Grain recently held an on-site meeting in Huaiyang County for various special districts, cities, and 35 key sweet potato producing counties, to visit and exchange experiences in sweet potato storage, processing, and comprehensive utilization, and studied measures for storage, processing, and comprehensive utilization. The meeting requested that, while planting wheat well, a vigorous mass "six-good" movement for sweet potatoes should be launched, namely "harvest well, store well, reserve seeds well, slice and dry well, comprehensively utilize well, and eat well," to ensure that "not a piece is lost, not a piece rots, not a slice is moldy, and not a sweet potato leaf or vine is thrown away." When harvesting, efforts should be made to ensure that the sweet potato tubers are harvested cleanly, the sweet potato vines are harvested cleanly, the sweet potato leaves are harvested cleanly, and the sweet potato crowns are harvested cleanly, to ensure the quality of the harvest and ensure a bumper harvest. The Kaifeng Prefectural Committee also held an on-site meeting in Shangqiu County with more than 300 people to study sweet potato storage, requiring that 69.3% of the total sweet potato production in the district be sliced and dried; 24.3% be stored as fresh sweet potatoes; 6.2% be processed; and 610 million jin be comprehensively utilized. Dancheng County has organized a professional team for storing sweet potatoes, and has vacated 15,200 rooms in warehouses, and the sweet potato processing plants in 13 communes are also actively preparing for sweet potato processing.

    河南红薯大增产
    据河南日报消息  河南省一千八百万亩红薯根据已经收获和预测的结果，平均单产可达七百六十七斤以上（红薯折粮），比大跃进的1958年将增产四成多。
    今年，河南省战胜了特大旱灾，已收的红薯都获得了大丰收，未收的也丰收在望。开封专区共种红薯五百万亩，已收的四十九万亩，平均单产八百八十斤（折粮），有六十三万亩春红薯，预计每亩可产鲜红薯五千四百零二斤。淮阳县已收的七万亩春红薯，平均单产一千二百二十四斤（折粮），太康县已收的三万六千亩红薯，平均单产达一千二百五十斤（折粮）。宁陵、夏邑、尉氏等六个县，红薯单产都可超过千斤以上（折粮）。各地还出现很多亩产万斤以上的丰产方、丰产田。上蔡县塔桥人民公社，有三千三百八十二亩红薯丰产方，单产可达一万五千斤。淮阳县鲁集大队二亩丰产田，根据挖棵检查，大棵每棵二十三斤，一般的每棵十四斤，单产可达三万九千多斤。
    目前，红薯大收季节已快到来，各地都接受去年的经验教训，对红薯的收、藏、加工作了具体部署。农业厅、粮食厅最近在淮阳县召开了各专、市和三十五个红薯生产重点县现场会议，参观交流了红薯收藏、加工、综合利用等方面的经验，研究了收藏、加工和综合利用的措施。会议要求，在种好小麦的同时，迅速掀起一个声势浩大的群众性的“收好、藏好、种留好、切片晒干好、综合利用好、吃好”的红薯“六好”运动，保证达到“一块不丢，一块不烂，一片不霉，一个红薯叶和秧不扔”的要求。收时作到薯块收净、薯秧收净、薯叶收净、薯龙头收净，保证收获质量，确保丰产丰收。开封地委也在商丘县召开了三百多人的现场会议，研究红薯收藏工作，要求全区切片晒干的红薯占红薯总产的69.3％；贮存占鲜红薯的24.3％；加工占6.2％；综合利用六亿一千万斤。郸城县已组织收藏红薯的专业队伍，并已腾出仓房一万五千二百间，十三个公社的红薯加工厂也在积极筹备红薯的加工工作。
