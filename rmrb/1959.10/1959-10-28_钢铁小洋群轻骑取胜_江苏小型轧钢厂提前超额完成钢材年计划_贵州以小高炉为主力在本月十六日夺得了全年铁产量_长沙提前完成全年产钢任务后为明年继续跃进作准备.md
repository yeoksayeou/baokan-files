Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 27th: Jiangsu Province had completed its annual steel production plan ahead of schedule by October 20th, exceeding the target by 16.2%.

Jiangsu Province's steel rolling industry developed from scratch during the Great Leap Forward last year. At present, the province has built a total of fifteen small steel rolling mills, and three more are under construction. The number of steel rolling technicians has grown to more than three thousand.

Since the beginning of this year, steel rolling units in Jiangsu Province have vigorously carried out technological innovations and improved equipment to meet the needs of production and construction. For example, due to insufficient billet opening capacity, the cadres and workers of the Nanjing Jianye Steel Rolling Mill, known for their hard work and self-reliance, conscientiously implemented the "walking on two legs" policy, successfully opening billets with 4-inch steel ingots on a 190 mm small rolling mill, breaking through the difficulty of rolling 4-inch steel ingots on rolling mills below 250 mm. Most of the province's steel rolling mills are small rolling mills pieced together from old machine parts, and only three rolling mills above 300 mm undertake the task of billet opening, which cannot produce slightly larger specifications of steel. Therefore, the steel rolling workers adopted the method of "attacking the big with the small" and rolled 28.32 mm screw steel and 3.5 gauge angle steel on a 190 mm small rolling mill. Due to the relative difficulty in supplying rolls and spare parts, they actively promoted the experience of roll surfacing and re-turning old rolls into small rolls. Workers in steel rolling mills in Suzhou, Wuxi, Jianye and other places also vigorously developed local cold beds, land rollers, and forward and reverse enclosures to overcome weak links in production.

This year, Jiangsu Province has also increased the variety and specifications of steel, and improved the quality of steel. At present, the variety and specifications have increased from more than 30 kinds at the beginning of the year to about 100 kinds; the steel qualification rate has increased from about 70% at the beginning of the year to more than 90%.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 27th: After completing its annual steel production task ahead of schedule, Guizhou Province also completed its annual iron production plan on the 16th, exceeding the target.

Last year's mass iron smelting campaign in Guizhou Province laid a good foundation in terms of manpower, material resources, and technology for the continued leap forward this year. This year, the construction of small blast furnaces in the province has been faster, better, more and more economical. In addition to the construction of five small iron and steel joint enterprises in Guiyang, Zunyi, Duyun, Shuicheng and Fuquan, seventy small blast furnaces with a total volume of 800 cubic meters have also been built in Zhenyuan, Panxian, Wengan and other places rich in mineral resources. Among them, small blast furnaces with a total volume of more than 500 cubic meters have been built and put into production one after another, becoming the main force in the province's iron smelting production line this year.

With the successive putting into production of a large number of small blast furnaces, leadership departments at all levels have adopted the method of grasping construction on the one hand and grasping production on the other, transferring a large number of cadres to the production front line to strengthen leadership and vigorously grasp production management and technical management. After many iron smelting units replenished their leadership backbone, they quickly established and improved many systems such as operating procedures, raw material management, product inspection, equipment maintenance, and post responsibility systems, which quickly brought pig iron production onto the right track, and the output increased sharply.

After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, a vigorous socialist labor emulation campaign was quickly launched on the iron smelting front. The qualification rate of pig iron in September rose to 86.5%. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has reached 0.947. Coke ratio and cost have also been significantly reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 27th: Changsha City, Hunan Province, has completed this year's steel production task ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. As of the 19th, the qualified steel ingots produced by the city had exceeded the annual plan by 0.64%, an increase of more than three times compared with the city's steel output last year.

At present, the cadres and workers on the city's steelmaking front are taking advantage of the excellent situation to continue to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely oppose right-leaning tendencies, encourage hard work, and launch a greater upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy, in order to overfulfill the steel ingot production increase plan for the fourth quarter and prepare for continued leaps forward next year.

### 钢铁小洋群轻骑取胜  江苏小型轧钢厂提前超额完成钢材年计划  贵州以小高炉为主力在本月十六日夺得了全年铁产量  长沙提前完成全年产钢任务后为明年继续跃进作准备

    钢铁小洋群轻骑取胜
    江苏小型轧钢厂提前超额完成钢材年计划
    贵州以小高炉为主力在本月十六日夺得了全年铁产量
    长沙提前完成全年产钢任务后为明年继续跃进作准备
    据新华社南京27日电　江苏省到10月20日止已提前超额16.2％完成了全年的钢材生产计划。
    江苏省轧钢工业是在去年大跃进中从无到有地发展起来的。目前全省已经建成的小型轧钢机共有十五套，还有三套正在建设。轧钢技术工人已经发展到三千人以上。
    江苏省各轧钢单位今年以来大搞技术革新，改进设备，以适应生产建设的需要。例如开坯能力不足，以穷办苦干著称的南京建邺轧钢厂职工就认真贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，用四吋钢锭在一百九十毫米的小轧机上开坯成功，冲破了二百五十毫米以下轧机轧四吋钢锭的难关。全省轧钢机绝大部分是用旧机零件凑成的小型轧机，仅有三套三百毫米以上的轧机承担开坯任务，不能生产稍大规格的钢材。于是，轧钢工人就采用“以小攻大”的办法，在一百九十毫米的小型轧机上轧出了二十八点三二毫米的螺丝钢和三点五号角钢。轧辊、备件供应比较困难，他们就积极推行了轧辊堆焊、旧轧辊重车小轧辊等经验。苏州、无锡、建邺等轧钢厂职工还大搞土冷床、土地辊、正反围盘等，克服了生产薄弱环节。
    今年，江苏省还增加了钢材品种、规格，提高了钢材的质量。目前品种规格已由年初三十多种增加到一百种左右；钢材合格率，已由年初的70％左右提高到90％以上。 
    据新华社贵阳27日电　贵州省继提前完成全年产钢任务之后，又在16日提前超额完成了全年产铁计划。
    贵州省去年群众性的炼铁运动，为今年的继续跃进在人力、物力和技术方面打下了良好的基础。今年全省小高炉的建设又多又快又好又省，除了建设贵阳、遵义、都匀、水城和福泉等五个小型钢铁联合企业以外，还在狰猿、盘县、瓮安等矿藏丰富的地方兴建了总容积达八百立方米的七十座小高炉，其中有容积共五百多立方米的小高炉已先后建成投入生产，成为今年全省炼铁生产战线的主力军。
    随着大批小高炉陆续投入生产，各级领导部门采取一手抓建设一手抓生产的办法，把大批干部调到生产战线上来，加强领导，狠抓生产管理和技术管理。许多炼铁单位充实了领导骨干以后，都迅速建立和健全了操作规程、原料材料管理、产品检验、设备维修和岗位责任制等许多制度，使生铁生产迅速走上正规，产量急剧上升。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，炼铁战线上迅速展开轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。9月份生铁合格率已上升到86.5％。高炉的利用系数已达到零点九四七。焦比和成本也已显著下降。
    据新华社长沙27日电　湖南长沙市已经提前超额完成了今年的产钢任务。到19日止，全市生产的合格钢锭已经超过全年计划0.64％，比去年全市钢产量增长三倍多。
    目前，全市炼钢战线上的职工正在乘大好形势，继续深入贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，坚决地反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起增产节约更大高潮，为超额完成第四季度增产钢锭计划，为明年继续跃进作好准备。（附图片）
