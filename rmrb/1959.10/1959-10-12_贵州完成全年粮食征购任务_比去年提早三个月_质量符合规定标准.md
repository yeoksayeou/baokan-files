Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 11th October: Guizhou Province completed its annual grain purchase task by October 8th this year. Compared to last year, the completion was three months ahead of schedule. The grain already stored in warehouses throughout the province has been inspected by local grain departments, and the quality meets the standards stipulated by the state.

This year, Guizhou Province suffered an unprecedented severe drought. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, members of all ethnic groups achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain crops generally increasing by 10% to 30%. In the days of the bumper harvest, especially inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a mass movement for autumn grain storage was rapidly launched throughout the province. Jinping County in the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture exceeded its grain storage task on September 16th. Other counties in the prefecture followed closely, also exceeding the annual grain purchase task by 2% on the 28th, taking the lead in the province. On September 30th, Anshun Prefecture organized 680,000 commune members and more than 30,000 ox carts to store 43.06 million jin of grain in one day, breaking all previous storage records. On average, more than one million people throughout the province participated in grain transportation every day.

While striving to deliver grain, the broad masses of commune members paid close attention to grain quality, ensuring that each commune delivered good grain. All counties in the Bijie Prefecture adhered to the principle that grain should not leave the team if it is not dry and clean, and should not enter the warehouse if it is not dry and clean. The moisture content of the stored grain was within the safe storage standard. The Fengyan Management Area of the Juren Commune in Nayong County inspected the receiving, threshing, drying, and roasting work every day. Before entering the warehouse, the transportation tools were also inspected. Therefore, all the stored grain met the safety standards. Miao commune members in the Zhenfeng Commune of Xingren County, in order to dry the grain for storage, voluntarily contributed more than 13,000 items, such as sleeping mats, oilcloths, and bedsheets, from their homes as grain drying tools when the drying mats and threshing grounds were insufficient. People's communes in various places also organized and utilized tobacco curing rooms and iron pots to dry and roast grain, ensuring that dry grain could be stored even on rainy days.

The people's communes have demonstrated their unparalleled superiority in completing this year's grain purchase task ahead of schedule. The communes, due to overall arrangements in all aspects, implemented the method of assigning agricultural tools to the fields, dividing labor to the plots, assigning responsibility to individuals, harvesting and threshing as soon as a piece of land was ripe, and focusing on the "Three Autumns" production during the day and fully delivering grain at night, ensuring that production and storage were not delayed. The People's Communes of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture organized a 500,000-strong grain transportation army composed of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and delivered grain by land and water. Many communes also carried out labor cooperation internally, speeding up the progress of grain storage. The Shuangjing People's Commune in Huangping County organized production teams with late maturing autumn grain to support the transport of public grain from teams with early maturing grain, completing the task 176 days earlier than last year. The Xinpu Management Area of the Yongning Commune in Zhenning County organized more than 1,100 people and more than 100 packhorses to concentrate their support for the Zhaode Production Team, which lacked labor, to rush the delivery of grain.

The early and tight grasp of the task by Party committees at all levels is the fundamental guarantee for the early completion of this year's grain purchase task in the province. As early as mid-August, meetings were held at all levels to study and deploy this year's autumn grain purchase task, implement the "Three Fixes" policy, and implement the purchase task to the production teams. At the same time, grain purchase offices were established in various places, with the Party Secretary personally taking charge. Many commune Party committees and branch secretaries also personally participated in the grain delivery, further inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for grain delivery.

　　贵州完成全年粮食征购任务
    比去年提早三个月　质量符合规定标准
    新华社贵阳11日电　贵州省到10月8日为止已完成了今年全年的粮食征购任务。同去年相比，时间提早了三个月。全省已入库的粮食，经过各地粮食部门检查，质量符合国家规定的标准。
    今年贵州全省遭受空前严重的旱灾，但是由于各族社员在党的正确领导下，发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，夺得空前丰收，粮食作物一般增产一成到三成。在丰收的日子里，特别在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，全省各地迅速掀起了秋粮入库的群众运动。黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏县，在9月16日超额完成粮食入库任务之后，全州其他各县奋起直追，也在28日超额2％完成全年粮食征购任务，在全省领先。安顺专区9月30日组织六十八万社员、三万多部牛马车，一天入库粮食四千三百零六万斤，打破历年入库纪录。全省参加运粮的人数，平均每天有一百多万人。
    广大社员在争先送粮中，十分注意粮食质量，社社保证送好粮。毕节专区各县坚持了粮食不干不净不出队、不干不净不入仓的原则，入库粮食水分都在安全保管标准以内。纳雍县居仁公社风岩管理区，按日检查收、打、晒、烘、炕等项工作，入库前又对运粮用具进行检查，因此入库粮食全部符合安全标准。兴仁县贞丰公社的苗族社员，为了把粮食晒干入库，在晒席、晒坝不足的情况下，自动拿出各人家里的睡席、油布、被单等一万三千多件，作为晒粮工具。各地人民公社还组织、利用烤烟烘房和铁锅等设备来烘炕粮食，保证雨天也有干粮入库。
    在提前完成今年粮食征购任务中，人民公社显示了它的无比优越性。各公社由于从各方面进行了通盘安排，实行农具到田、分工到丘、责任到人，熟一块收一块打一块，白天突击三秋生产、晚上全力送粮的办法，保证了生产、入库两不误。黔东南苗族侗族自治州各人民公社组织由工农商学兵五十万人参加的运粮大军，分水陆两路突击交售粮食。有许多公社内部还开展了劳力协作，加快了粮食入库进度。黄平县双井人民公社组织秋粮成熟晚的生产队和成熟早的队互相支援运送公粮，使完成任务时间比去年提早一百七十六天。镇宁县永宁公社新铺管理区组织一千一百多人和一百多匹驮马，集中支援劳力不足的招德生产队突击送粮。
    各级党委抓得早、抓得紧，是今年全省粮食征购任务能提前完成的根本保证。早在8月中旬，各地就层层召开会议，研究布置了今年的秋粮征购任务，贯彻了“三定”政策，把征购任务落实到生产队。同时，各地都成立粮食征购办公室，由党委书记亲自挂帅。许多公社党委和支部书记，还亲自参加送粮，更加激发了群众的送粮热情。
