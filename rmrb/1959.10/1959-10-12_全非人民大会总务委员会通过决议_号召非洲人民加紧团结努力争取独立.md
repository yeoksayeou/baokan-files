Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 9th October: The General Affairs Committee of the All-Africa People's Conference concluded its three-day meeting this evening. A resolution passed at the meeting called on the African people to further strive for independence and unity.

　　The General Affairs Committee decided to hold the next plenary session of the All-Africa People's Conference in Tunis from January 26th to 29th, 1960. The committee also elected Guinean Minister Resident in Ghana, Diallo, as Secretary-General.

　　The resolution passed at the meeting expressed satisfaction with the evolution of the struggle for independence and unity in Africa since the Accra Conference in 1958. The resolution stated that the "people in all parts of Africa are intensifying their efforts to achieve independence, despite the brutal repression they are suffering." The resolution called on all African organizations to further strengthen their organizations and strive for overall unity, as this is the most reliable guarantee of victory. The resolution also "appealed to independent African countries and the United Nations for further support for the cause of African independence and unity."

　　The resolution called on the national organizations of the Belgian Congo to "unite their forces into a united liberation front." The resolution demanded that the Belgian government "establish parliaments at all levels and a government elected through democratic elections (in the Congo), in accordance with the demands put forward by the national organizations of the Congo."

　　The resolution "strongly condemned the consistent policies of repression, discrimination, and disregard for human rights in Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, South West Africa, Angola, Mozambique, and other places," and demanded "the lifting of the state of emergency in territories such as Kenya, Nyasaland, Rhodesia, and Uganda."

　　In referring to Cameroon, the resolution demanded "an immediate end to the repressive measures in this territory, the repeal of the laws prohibiting the activities of the Cameroon People's Union, the maintenance of democratic freedoms, the implementation of a comprehensive and unconditional amnesty, and the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations before declaring independence."

　　The resolution stated, in referring to Algeria, that it "reiterates its full support for the heroic Algerian people, its full support for the constructive proposals contained in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria's response (to the de Gaulle Plan), and demands that the French government begin negotiations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria."

　　The resolution condemned France's intention to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara and strongly supported the proposal for an immediate cessation of all nuclear tests and for the research and manufacture of nuclear weapons, the destruction of all stockpiled nuclear weapons, and the removal of all rocket bases.

　　In his closing remarks, Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah welcomed the convening of the meeting and the various resolutions passed at the meeting. He said, "Our demand for freedom is a demand for justice. There is no room for compromise on this demand." He emphasized, "We are fully aware of the dangers and pitfalls we will face on the road ahead, but we are moving forward courageously, without retreating or hesitating, and no resistance can stop us from moving forward."

    新华社阿克拉9日电　全非人民大会总务委员会今天晚上结束了它的历时三天的会议。会议通过的一项决议号召非洲人民进一步努力来争取独立和统一。
    总务委员会决定于1960年1月26日到29日在突尼斯举行下届全非人民大会全体会议。委员会还选举了几内亚常驻加纳部长迪亚洛为秘书长。
    会议通过的决议对于自从1958年阿克拉会议以来非洲争取独立和统一的斗争形势的演变表示满意。决议说，非洲各地的“人民都在加紧努力争取独立，尽管他们遭受着残酷的镇压”。决议号召所有非洲组织进一步努力加强自己的组织，争取实现全面的团结，因为这是取得胜利的最可靠的保证。决议还“呼吁非洲独立国家和联合国进一步支持非洲的独立和统一事业”。
    决议号召比属刚果的全国性组织“把自己的力量团结到一个联合解放阵线中去”。决议要求比利时政府“根据刚果的全国性组织提出的要求，（在刚果）建立各级议会和一个通过民主选举产生的政府”。
    决议“强烈谴责在怯尼亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀、尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、南非、西南非、安哥拉、莫三鼻给等地一贯奉行的镇压、歧视和无视人权的政策”，要求“撤销在怯尼亚、尼亚萨兰、罗得西亚和乌干达等领地实行的紧急状态”。
    决议在谈到喀麦隆时，要求“立即制止在这个领地的镇压措施，废除禁止喀麦隆人民联盟活动的法律，维护民主自由，实行全面的无条件的大赦，在宣布独立以前，举行在联合国监督之下的自由选举”。
    决议谈到阿尔及利亚时说，它“重申完全支持英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，完全支持包含在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府（对戴高乐计划）的答复中的建设性建议，并且要求法国政府开始同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府举行谈判”。
    决议谴责法国打算在撒哈拉进行核试验，并且竭力支持关于立即停止一切核试验和关于核武器的研究与制造、销毁所有储存的核武器和撤除一切火箭基地的主张。
    加纳总理恩克鲁玛在闭幕词中表示欢迎这次会议的召开和会议所通过的各项决议。他说，“我们争取自由的要求，是正义的要求。对这个要求没有妥协的余地”。他强调说，“我们充分认识到在前进道路上我们所将面临的危险和陷阱，但是我们在勇往直前地迈进着，决不会后退，也不犹豫不决，没有任何阻力能够阻挡我们前进。”
