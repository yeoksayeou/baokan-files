Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch:

    "Wherever the Party points, we will fight there! We must respond to the great battle call issued by the Party Central Committee with even more outstanding achievements!" This was the unanimous determination expressed by the more than six thousand delegates participating in the "Heroes' Conference" during their group meetings.

    On the evenings of the 26th and 27th, all the delegates held group discussions on the congratulatory message from the Party Central Committee and the reports given to the conference by Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo. They enthusiastically poured out their inner emotions, saying that only in today's society could they, as the Party Central Committee said, become the Party and the country's most valuable asset and be respected by the Party and the country. The delegates regarded the days they spent with the Party and state leaders as the happiest and most unforgettable moments of their lives. Many veteran workers, when talking about their happiness today in the group meetings, could not help but recall their suffering in the old society. Shi Chuanxiang, a Beijing sanitation worker elected as a member of the conference presidium, said, "In the old society, we ate the roads, slept on the roads, covered by the earth and sky, with half a brick as a pillow. But today, the Party and state leaders shook my hand and encouraged me to study culture well. This is the highest honor for me!" Liu Guangjin, a stoker from the boiler workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant, said, "All the honor should be attributed to the Party and to Chairman Mao. Without the Party and Chairman Mao, where would we be today?" Many delegates were moved to tears by the earnest exhortations of the central leaders. They kept in mind the words of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo: "There should be no backward people next to advanced producers," "One flower does not make a spring; a riot of color is spring," and "One person's advancement is just a lone soldier; everyone's advancement can move mountains and overturn seas." They expressed their determination to wholeheartedly help their comrades catch up to their level after returning to their units.

    At the group meetings, the delegates also used their own personal experiences to prove the complete correctness of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, refuting the slanders of right-leaning opportunists. In a group meeting of the Shanghai electrical machinery system, lathe operator Wang Bingxiang angrily said, "The right-leaning opportunists say that the Great Leap Forward has ruined things, and that engaging in mass movements has ruined things. This is sheer nonsense! Our factory's production last year was several times higher than the year before, and this year, in just nine months, it has greatly exceeded the entire year of last year. I created a machine for processing screws, which has increased efficiency hundreds of times. Is this what they call the Great Leap Forward ruining things?!"

    The battle call issued by the Party Central Committee at the Heroes' Conference touched the hearts of the heroes, word by word. Full of vigor, they enthusiastically expressed in the group meetings their determination to respond to the Party's call with practical actions of completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and striving for continued leaps forward next year. A competitive spirit of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced was fully revealed in the group discussions. Meng Tai, a veteran model worker from the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, vowed to seize the national red banner for medium-sized blast furnaces from the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel. He said, "Now we have already won the national red banner for large blast furnaces! This is not enough. We must take the national red banner for medium-sized blast furnaces from Benxi!"

    Many delegates put forward new leap forward plans on the spot at the group meetings. Li Zhentian, a veteran technician from the Fourth Engineering Office of the Qinghai Xining Railway Bureau, proposed to break the national record of 150 meters of monthly progress in earthen tunnels, guaranteeing to reach 170 meters and striving for 180 meters. The Ding Qingyun Concrete Youth Shock Brigade, which made outstanding achievements in the construction of the Great Hall of the People, is already working on the tasks of 1962. Ding Qingyun, the leader of the brigade, said at the group meeting that participating in this conference has made us even more energized, and we must complete the work volume of the second five-year plan in the first quarter of next year.

    The delegates also expressed their determination to carry out technical revolution on a large scale to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee. Wang Tuliang, a young worker from the Shanghai Machine Tool Electrical Appliance Factory, excitedly said at the group meeting, "Thirteen workers in our group have organized a 'Tiger Hunting Team.' We guarantee to bring down two hundred big and small tigers in the fourth quarter, that is to say, to achieve two hundred technical innovations." The loudspeaker paper cone group of the Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory has already changed from manual operation to mechanized and automated operation, reducing the number of workers from forty-eight to eight. Recently, they also plan to further realize radio control in 1961, requiring only one worker. Gong Hanchao, the delegate of this advanced group, said at the group meeting, "Now, I feel that this plan is too slow. We must realize it in the second quarter of next year."

    The reports of the Party and state leaders pointed out that industry and transportation should support the technical transformation of agriculture, which gave the delegates great inspiration. Zhang Yanrong, a female lathe operator from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, said, "Our workers have a heavy task. After returning, I must work hard with everyone to ensure that the diesel engine is successfully trial-produced by the end of the year and produce more combine harvesters to support agriculture." Representatives from the railway sector stated: Supporting agriculture is to develop industry. In conjunction with our work, we must transport more and faster and transport more materials to support agriculture. Representatives from the commercial sector all expressed their willingness to assist agricultural departments in realizing the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agricultural production.

    Representatives from the financial and trade front guaranteed to make outstanding achievements in procurement and supply work to respond to the call of the Central Committee. Jia Tianwen, a commercial representative from Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, said, "Gaocheng County has completed the annual procurement plan for fresh eggs, waste products, medicinal materials, and other agricultural and sideline products. We are determined to fight hard in the fourth quarter and comprehensively complete the procurement plan for various agricultural and sideline products one month ahead of schedule, striving for a full house of red banners in the county." You Qibin, a representative of the Koutou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinle County, Hebei, which has achieved remarkable results in promoting diversified operations in rural areas, expressed that they must work hard in the three winter months to realize the "Thousand Item Economy" production plan they recently proposed, achieving the goal of 100 yuan income per commune member.

    The delegates expressed at the group meetings that they all held an attitude of contributing treasures and learning from experience and wanted to bring the rich harvest of this conference back to their own units. Many people have already arranged specific plans for "learning from experience." Some representatives are looking for peers to exchange experiences during the conference's brief rest periods. Zhang Baifa, the famous steel bar youth shock brigade leader in Beijing, and his roommate each kept a copy of the newspaper from these days, preparing to take them back and study them carefully. Many delegates couldn't wait to write letters, make phone calls, and send telegrams to their teams, reporting the spirit of the conference and asking them to quickly send new good news about production and construction.

    用出色成绩响应党的伟大号召
    群英会分组讨论中六千英雄倾吐内心激情
    据新华社28日讯　“党指向哪里，我们就战斗在哪里，一定要以更加出色的成就来响应党中央发出的伟大的战斗号召。”这是参加“群英会”的六千多个代表在小组会上一致表示的决心。
    26、27日晚上，全体代表分组讨论党中央的祝词和国务院副总理李富春、薄一波向大会所作的报告。他们热情地倾吐内心激情，他们说，只有在今天的社会里，我们才会如党中央所说的，成为党和国家最宝贵的财产，受到党和国家的尊重。代表们把自己和党和国家领导人一起度过的日子，作为一生中最幸福的时刻，最难忘的时刻。许多老工人在小组会上一谈到今天的幸福，就不禁联想起在旧社会的痛苦。被选为大会主席团成员的北京粪便清洁工时传祥说：“在旧社会里我们吃马路，睡马路，铺着地，盖着天，脑袋枕着半块砖。而今天，党和国家的领导人和我握手，勉励我要好好学文化，这是给我最崇高的荣誉！”石景山发电厂锅炉车间司炉刘光金说：“一切荣誉都要归功于党，归功于毛主席。没有党和毛主席，那有今天？”不少代表对中央负责同志的谆谆嘱咐，激动得流下了眼泪。他们把李富春、薄一波副总理所说的：“先进生产者的旁边不应当有落后的人”，“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”，“一人先进只是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海”等话牢记在心，表示回去以后一定要以满腔热情帮助同伴赶上自己的水平。
    代表们在小组会上，还纷纷用自己亲身的事实来证明总路线、大跃进的完全正确，驳斥右倾机会主义分子的诬蔑。在上海电机系统的一个小组会上，车工王秉祥愤怒地说：“右倾机会主义分子说大跃进跃坏了，大搞群众运动搞坏了，真是胡说八道！我们厂去年生产比前年翻了几番，今年只九个月又大大超过了去年全年。我创造了加工螺丝的机器，使效率提高了好几百倍，这难道是大跃进跃坏了吗！？”
    党中央在群英大会发出的战斗号召，一字一句地打动着英雄们的心。他们意气风发，在小组会上热烈地表示要以提前完成今年计划、力争明年继续跃进的实际行动，来响应党的号召。一股比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛劲头，在小组讨论中就充分表露出来了。鞍钢第一炼铁厂老劳动模范孟泰，立志要夺取本溪第一炼铁厂的全国中型高炉红旗。他说：“现在我们已经拿到了全国大型高炉红旗啦！这还不行，非得把全国中型高炉红旗从本溪夺过来！”
    许多代表在小组会上当场提出了新的跃进计划。青海西宁铁路局第四工程处老技师李振田，提出要刷新土质隧道月进一百五十米的全国最高纪录，保证达到一百七十米，力争一百八十米。在建筑人民大会堂中作出出色成绩的丁庆云混凝土青年突击队现在已经在做1962年的工作了。队长丁庆云在小组会上说，参加这次大会，使我们更绷紧了劲儿，第二个五年计划五年的工作量，一定要在明年第一季度完成。
    代表们还表示要大搞技术革命，来响应党中央的号召。上海机床电器厂青年工人王土良，在小组会上兴奋地说：“我们小组里有十三个工人组织了一个‘找虎队’，我们保证在第四季度要打下两百只大小老虎，也就是说，要实现两百项技术革新。”上海广播器材厂扬声器纸盆小组已经把手工操作改为机械化自动化操作，使四十八个工人减少到八个人。最近，他们又打算在1961年进一步实现无线电操纵，只要一个工人。这个先进小组的代表龚汉超，在小组会上说：“现在，我又感到这个打算太慢了，一定要在明年第二季度实现。”
    党和国家负责人在报告中指出工业、交通运输要支援农业技术改造，给代表们很大的启发。北京农业机械厂女车工张艳荣说：“我们工人的任务重大，回去后我一定和大家好好的干，保证到年底把柴油发动机试制成功，生产更多的联合收割机支援农业。”铁路部门的代表表示：支援农业就是为了发展工业，结合我们的业务，就是要多拉快跑，更多地运送支援农业的物资。商业部门的代表都纷纷表示要协助农业部门实现农业生产的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。
    财贸战线上的代表保证在收购和供应工作方面做出出色成绩来响应中央的号召。来自河北省蒿城县的商业代表贾天文说，“蒿城县已经完成了鲜蛋、废品、药材等农副产品全年的收购计划，我们决心大战第四季度，提前一个月全面完成各项农副产品的收购计划力争全县满堂红。促进农村多种经营获得显著成绩的河北新乐县口头供销部代表尤歧彬表示，一定要大干冬三月，实现他们最近提出的发展“千项经济”生产计划，达到公社社员每人收入一百元的奋斗目标。
    代表们在小组会上纷纷表示，他们都抱着献宝又取经的态度，要把这次大会上的丰富收获，带回本单位去。很多人已经安排好了“取经”的具体计划，有的代表在大会短暂的休息时间，就在寻找同行交流经验。北京著名的钢筋青年突击队长张百发，和他同房的代表，把这几天的报纸各人保存一份，准备带回去好好学习。许多代表还迫不及待地写信、打电话、拍电报给自己的队组，报告大会的精神，要求他们赶快传来生产建设的新捷报。（附图片）
