　　Oh, Clear Well Water!
　　——Observations from a Pastoral People's Commune
　　Zhang Changgong
　　If water had a personality, it would be unpredictable. In mighty rivers, it sometimes flows peacefully, while at other times it surges and roars with fury. Yet, on the arid grasslands, it is so scarce – finding a drop of water in the Gobi Desert is harder than finding gold in sand!

　　However, the personality of water can be changed. Let's not even talk about building bridges across the Yangtze or damming the Yellow River; let's just talk about how Mongolian herdsmen on a stretch of grassland, using the power of the people's commune, used their dragon-taming, tiger-subduing hands to build water conservancy projects.

　　The Yihe Nuoer Grassland is located in the southeastern part of the Balin Right Banner. On this more than 1,000-square-kilometer pasture, the Yihe Nuoer People's Commune grazes more than 88,000 head of livestock. But there are too many livestock and not enough pasture. Due to poor water and grass, livestock suffered from epidemics every year. In 1957, the worst year, more than 14,000 head of livestock died.

　　In 1958, the clarion call of the Great Leap Forward resounded across the skies, and the Party called for large-scale water conservancy projects in pastoral areas to eliminate waterless grasslands. The herdsmen's eyes lit up and their hearts blossomed as they looked towards the peaks of Aolun Taolagai (Multi-Headed Mountain) and thought of Hariba Zhao at the foot of the mountain.

　　Hariba Zhao, forty li from north to south and fifty li from east to west, is located between the two peaks of Aolun Taolagai Mountain and Hariba Mountain. Here, half-man-high mountain alfalfa and the sheep's favorite Tana grass grow. Standing on the summit of Aolun Taolagai Mountain and looking far into the distance, you can see the boundless Hariba Zhao wilderness, with green grass like a carpet stretching to the horizon, as flat as a mirror, as smooth and soft as satin. How wonderful it would be to develop this pasture! But, the difficulties! This place is a notorious arid land. In the vast grasslands, there is not a single drop of water! Due to drought, no one has grazed here for a long time.

　　People said: There is no water in Hariba Zhao. Digging a well there is a waste of effort. Even if you dig a hundred zhang, you won't find water. Even if you dig for a hundred years, you won't find water! Hariba Zhao, you mysterious arid grassland, who can unlock your secrets?

　　In the era of the Great Leap Forward, the hearts of the herdsmen were like unbridled steeds, able to traverse high mountains, ridges, deserts, and swamps with a single bound; with a wave of their hands, they could embrace the entire grassland…Let's do it! Wild winds cannot stop the high flight of wild geese, and difficulties cannot scare the people of the grasslands. The Sumu Party Committee decided to draw on manpower and materials from various Gacha to carry out communist large-scale collaboration and make every effort to open up Hariba Zhao.

　　Whenever such a large project was encountered, people felt that the size of the primary cooperative was too small and the labor force was insufficient. Especially in pastoral areas, where the population is small and the land is vast, the strength of the primary cooperative alone cannot completely defeat the drought demon. With the need to develop production, people longed for large-scale cooperatives and looked forward to a new organizational form that could further liberate the productive forces. Just at this time, people's communes were being established in agricultural areas one after another. As soon as it appeared, it shone like the rising sun in the east. The people of the grasslands saw the various advantages of the people's commune with their own eyes, and they cheered in unison: "Aridinigetele Saimu! (People's Commune is good!)"

　　In December, seven Gacha and thirty-two Yingzi joined together, and the Yihe Nuoer People's Commune was born. Due to the improved production organization and the establishment of various specialized teams, the shortage of labor was quickly reversed, and 180 strong laborers were drawn out to form a large water conservancy construction army to declare war on the arid grasslands.

　　At this time, good news came from the neighboring village: the Baori Wusu People's Commune had a Tamuhan Zhao, which was also an arid grassland with the same characteristics as Hariba Zhao. Yang Shuying, a 58-year-old female communist party member in their commune, led eight women in a hard battle for 25 days and dug a five-zhang-deep well there. The facts were before the people, and the gurgling spring water of Tamuhan Zhao brought encouragement and strength to the people of the Yihe Nuoer Commune.

　　In the depths of winter, snow filled the sky, the north wind was biting, and the ground was as hard as stone… The commune members camped all over Hariba Zhao, and this vast and desolate wilderness suddenly became boiling.

　　Once the power of the masses is mobilized, they can truly move Mount Tai with their hands and kick the East Sea with their feet. In the blink of an eye, the construction site was like an avalanche and earthquake, instantly making you unable to recognize that this was the desolate Hariba Zhao. Many problems in the construction were readily solved: If there were no well-building stones, the commune mobilized eighty wooden carts to transport them; if there were no houses to live in, people dug "underground houses"; the required timber was brought out from their own homes by the masses; lacking tools, iron and woodworking artisans in the commune were organized to build them on the spot; the herdsmen lacked well-digging techniques, and technicians were transferred from the Mazongshan agricultural team….

　　Nima, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Xiribu, the director of the commune, also often took turns going to the construction site. Nima was tall, spoke slowly, behaved quietly, and smiled sweetly. Director Xiribu was a burly man, a decisive and resolute person. As soon as they came to the construction site, the commune members felt energetic, as if they would never tire.

　　The construction site was filled with loud songs, laughter, and the sound of shovels and picks everywhere, and the sound of labor horns everywhere… Boom! The explosives blasted through layers of slate, and the wasteland that had been sleeping for so many years awakened in the explosion. These herdsmen were good at raising livestock, but they had never done the work of holding shovels and picks since they were little! However, listen to the heroic oath:

　　Draw water from the sky to dig the Milky Way,
　　Dig underground to the Dragon King's Palace,
　　If the well does not produce water, we will not retreat,
　　We will not go down the mountain without a complete victory!

　　The Commune Party Committee paid special attention to the commune members' clothing, food, housing, and other aspects. When a young man wore a blister on his hand, the secretary of the Party Committee immediately put down his own pickaxe and bandaged it for him. While bandaging, he thought, "It would be great to have a pair of sheepskin gloves to wear!" So he hurried back to the commune and mobilized the sewing group to rush to make gloves for the water conservancy commando team. Immediately, more than twenty sewing machines started operating, and the girls used their skillful hands to sew many pairs of sheepskin gloves overnight with dense stitches.

　　The entire commune was supporting the well-digging construction site, and everyone was vying to go to Hariba Zhao.

　　Stones were encountered during well-digging. Although the stones were hard, they were not as strong as the will of the commune members; quicksand was encountered. Quicksand was difficult to treat, but the commune members had more solutions… They dug twenty-three wells in one go, the deepest reaching twelve zhang, with an average well depth of eight and a half zhang. They were all built with stone and equipped with waterwheels. From summer to autumn, more than 54,000 head of livestock were grazed in Hariba Zhao. Houses were built, and warm sheds were set up to prepare to concentrate all the commune's horses and sheep there as winter camps.

　　Hariba Zhao produced water! The herdsmen couldn't help but cup the water in their hands and drink a few mouthfuls. It was sweet, sweet all the way to their hearts. Sweet well water, clear and bright well water, look, the reflection of Multi-Headed Mountain is reflected in the water surface, and the colorful clouds, flowing clouds, stars, and the Milky Way in the sky are also reflected in the water surface!

    清亮亮的井水呀
    ——牧区人民公社见闻
    张长弓
    假如水也有性格的话，水的性格该是变幻莫测的。在滔滔的江河里，它有时平静地流淌，有时却浪涛汹涌，暴跳如雷；在干旱的草原上，它却又那么吝啬——戈壁滩上寻找一滴水比沙里淘金还难啊！
    然而，水的性格是可以改变的。且不说长江建桥，黄河截流，只讲一段草地的蒙古牧民运用人民公社的力量，用他们那擒龙伏虎的双手兴修水利的故事吧。
    益和诺尔草原，在巴林右翼旗的东南部，在这一千多平方公里的牧场上，放牧着益和诺尔人民公社的八万八千多头牲畜。但，牲畜多草场却不够用。由于水草不好，牲畜每年都发生疫病，1957年最厉害时，死亡牲畜达一万四千多头。
    1958年，大跃进的号角响彻云霄，党号召在牧业区大搞水利，消灭无水草原。牧民们眼睛亮了，心花开了，他们遥望着敖伦陶拉盖（多头山）的山峰，想起了山下的哈日巴召。
    哈日巴召，南北四十里，东西五十里，在敖伦陶拉盖山和哈日巴山两峰之间，这里生长着半人深的山苜蓿和羊子最爱吃的塔那草。登上敖伦陶拉盖山的顶峰纵目远眺，但见哈日巴召原野一望无际，绿草如茵，一直向天边伸展，像镜子一样平，像缎子一样光滑、柔软。开辟这片草场该有多么好呵！可是，困难哪！这地方是出名的干旱之地，茫茫草原，没有一滴水！由于干旱，长久以来没有人在这里放牧过。
    人们说：哈日巴召没有水，在那儿打井白搭工，挖一百丈也出不了水，挖一百年也出不了水！哈日巴召呀，你这谜一样的干旱草原，有谁能揭开你的奥秘？
    在大跃进的年代里，牧民的心像撒缰骏马，一躬身就能踏遍高山峻岭、沙漠、水沼；一举手就可以把整个大草原搂入怀抱……干哪！狂风挡不住鸿雁高飞，困难吓不倒草原的人们。苏木党委决定在各嘎查里抽调人力、物力，开展共产主义大协作，全力开辟哈日巴召。
    一遇到这样的大工程，人们就觉得初级社规模太小、劳动力太不够用了。特别是在牧业区，人口少，地片大，单凭初级社的力量是无法彻底战胜旱魔的。随着发展生产的需要，人们渴望着办大社，期待着有一个新的能够进一步解放生产力的组织形式。正在这时候，农业区纷纷建起了人民公社。它一出现，就像东方升起的太阳一样光芒四射。草地的人们亲眼看到了人民公社的种种优越性，他们齐声欢呼：“阿日迪尼格特勒赛音！（人民公社好）”
    12月，七个嘎查、三十二个营子联合起来，益和诺尔人民公社诞生了。由于改进了生产组织，建起了各种专业队，迅速扭转了劳动力不足的局面，抽调出了一百八十名强壮劳动力，组成了兴修水利大军，向干旱草原宣战。
    这时，邻村传来了喜讯：宝日勿苏人民公社有个他木罕召，也是和哈日巴召性质相同的干旱草场。他们公社里五十八岁的女共产党员杨树英带领着八名妇女苦战二十五天，在那里打出一眼五丈深的水井。事实摆在人们面前，他木罕召的淙淙泉水声给益和诺尔公社的人们带来了鼓舞和力量。
    隆冬数九，雪花满天，朔风刺骨，地硬如石……社员们在哈日巴召遍地扎营，这个广阔而又荒漠的原野一下子沸腾起来了。
    群众的力量一发动起来，真可以手搬泰山，脚踢东海。眨眼之间，工地上就像雪崩地震一样，立刻使你认不出这儿就是荒凉的哈日巴召。施工中的许多问题都迎刃而解了：没有砌井石，公社里调出八十辆木车运送；没房子住，人们挖了“地窨子”；所需的木材群众都从自己家里拿出来了；缺少工具，组织起公社里的铁木工就地打造；牧民们缺乏打井技术，从马鬃山农业队里调来了技术员……。
    公社党委书记尼玛和社长希日布也经常轮流到工地。尼玛，高高的身材，说话慢悠悠，举止文静，笑起来甜蜜蜜的。社长希日布却是个彪形大汉，是个说干就干，雷厉风行的人。他们一来到工地，社员们就浑身长劲，好像永远也不会疲倦。
    工地上歌声嘹喨，笑语喧哗，到处是锨镐声，到处是劳动号子声……轰隆隆！炸药爆破了层层石板，多少年来一直沉睡着的荒原在爆破声中苏醒了。这些牧民，若论经养牲畜倒是一把好手，若讲拿锨动镐的活儿，他们是从小长这么大也没干过呵！然而，你听听英雄的誓言：
    上天引水掘银河，
    地下挖到龙王殿，
    井不出水不收兵，
    不获全胜不下山！
    公社党委对社员们的衣、食、住等方面都特别加以照顾。一个小伙子手上磨出了血，党委书记马上撂下自己的镐头给他包扎起来。他一面包扎一面想：“这要做双羊皮手套戴上该多好呵！”于是他急忙赶回公社，发动缝纫组给水利突击队的人们赶制手套。立刻二十余台缝纫机开动起来了，姑娘们用她们的巧手密针密线连夜做出了许多羊皮手套。
    全公社都在支援打井工地，人人都争着抢着要到哈日巴召去。
    打井中遇到了石头，石头虽硬却没有社员的意志坚强；碰到了流沙，流沙难治，但社员们的办法更多……他们一气打了二十三眼井，最深的达十二丈，平均井深八丈五，并且都用石头砌好，安装上了水车。从夏到秋，在哈日巴召放牧着五万四千多头牲畜，并盖上了房子，搭上了暖棚圈，准备将全公社的马和羊都集中到那儿，作为冬营地。
    哈日巴召出水了！牧民们情不自禁地捧起水来喝上几口，甜丝丝，一直甜到心窝。甜甜的井水呀，清亮亮的井水呀，你看，多头山的倒影映进水面，天上的彩霞，流云，星星，银河也映进了水面！
