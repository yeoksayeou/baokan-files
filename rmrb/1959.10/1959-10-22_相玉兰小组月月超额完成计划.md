Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st - The Xiang Yulan group of the fine yarn workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, which has exceeded the state production plan every month for six consecutive years, exceeded the state production plan by 20% in the first half of October.

This fine yarn group is a "model soldier" of the "Five-Good" (good production, good study, good management, good unity and cooperation, good safety and hygiene) groups in Tianjin. From October 1956 to September 1959, they increased the production of cotton yarn by 80,985 pounds and saved 3,212 pounds of cotton for the state. It is an advanced collective that has maintained the title of municipal model group for several years. All 21 female workers in the group have reached the standard of municipal textile experts. The speed of yarn piecing by the doffers has generally increased from 13 or 14 yarns per minute at the beginning of the year to 18 to 21 yarns, the doffing time has been shortened from 40 seconds to 30 seconds, the roving change time has been shortened from about 8 seconds to about 6 seconds, and the phenomenon of empty spindles has been basically eliminated. Since entering October, the workers of the group have been full of energy and determined to complete the annual plan one month ahead of schedule. They have further strengthened patrols and machine maintenance, and the daily output has increased sharply, with an average daily increase of 200 pounds of cotton yarn. At the same time, the group workers are also actively preparing conditions for a greater leap forward next year, and have launched a wave of learning advanced operation methods and researching the automation of cleaning work in order to further increase the speed of the machines.

Thorough and meticulous political and ideological education for the workers, helping the workers establish collectivist ideas, is the main reason why this group has become an advanced unit. In March of this year, in order to shorten the doffing time, the doffers were divided into two groups to start a competition. At the beginning, they picked on each other's faults, which affected the quality of work. The group leadership immediately organized the workers to discuss how to treat the competition problem. Through discussion, everyone improved their understanding, and from then on they cooperated with each other in the competition. For those workers who are temporarily lagging behind, the group adopts the method of "one key opens one lock" to patiently and sincerely help them. At the same time, they also often organize workers to study political current events to help workers broaden their horizons. In this way, all the workers in the group have made rapid progress. At present, seven people in the group have joined the Communist Party, ten have joined the Communist Youth League, and one has been rated as a municipal labor model. In this year alone, twelve people have been elected as advanced producers in the entire factory.

Seriously learning advanced experience inside and outside the group and inside and outside the factory has become a trend in this group. As soon as they hear that someone or some workshop or factory has advanced experience, they immediately send someone to learn from it. They often forget to eat and sleep in order to learn advanced experience. At the same time, the workers of this group also enthusiastically help others catch up with themselves. The workers of the fifth group of fine yarn class B are energetic, but their output is not well completed, and the workers are very anxious. After the workers of the Xiang Yulan group learned about this situation, they immediately sent the group leader Xiang Yulan to help. After Xiang Yulan arrived in the fifth group, she shook the car, doffed yarn, and held meetings with the workers of the fifth group. She found that the main reason for the low output of the fifth group was that the doffers and doffers did not cooperate well enough. After her help, the workers of the fifth group strengthened their cooperation, and they also completed the production plan.

While actively participating in the competition between groups in the factory, the workers of this group also pay attention to carrying out various forms of short-distance key competitions within the group. Such as the "opposite car" competition of the doffers and the "reducing the empty spindle rate" competition, which promoted the workers of the group to learn from each other and catch up with each other, so that the key production problems were broken through one by one, the operation level was improved step by step, and the group was guaranteed to exceed the state production plan every month for six years.

### 相玉兰小组月月超额完成计划

    相玉兰小组月月超额完成计划
    新华社天津21日电　连续六年月月超额完成国家生产计划的国营天津第四棉纺织厂细纱车间相玉兰小组，10月上半月又超额20％完成国家生产计划。
    这个细纱小组是天津市“五好”（生产好、学习好、管理好、团结协作好、安全卫生好）小组的“标兵”，她们从1956年10到1959年9月，共为国家增产棉纱八万零九百八十五磅，节约棉花三千二百一十二磅，是个几年来一直保持市级模范小组称号的先进集体。小组二十一名女工都达到了市级纺织能手的标准。挡车工接头速度普遍由年初的每分钟接十三、四根，提高到十八根到二十一根，落纱时间由四十秒缩短到三十秒，换粗纱的时间由八秒左右缩短到六秒左右，并基本上消灭了空锭现象。进入10月以来，小组工人更是干劲十足，决心提前一个月完成全年计划。她们进一步加强了巡回和机器检修，日产量骤增，每天平均增产棉纱二百磅。同时，小组工人还为明年的更大跃进积极准备条件，为进一步提高车速，掀起了学习先进操作方法和研究清洁工作自动化的热潮。
    深入细致地向工人进行政治思想教育，帮助工人树立集体主义思想，是这个小组成为先进单位的主要原因。今年3月，为了缩短落纱时间，落纱工分成两组展开竞赛。开始时，她们互挑毛病，影响了工作质量。小组领导上立即组织工人讨论怎样对待竞赛问题，通过讨论，大家提高了认识，从此在竞赛中互相协作。对于那些暂时还处于落后状态的工人，小组采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，耐心诚恳地对她们进行帮助。同时还经常组织工人学习政治时事，帮助工人开阔眼界。这样，全组工人进步很快，目前全组有七个人参加了共产党，十个人参加了共青团，还有一人被评为市级劳动模范，仅今年内就有十二人当选为全厂先进生产者。
    认真地学习组内外、厂内外的先进经验，在这个小组内已形成风气。她们一听说那个人或那个车间、工厂有先进经验，就马上派人去学习，她们常常为了学习先进经验废寝忘食。同时，这个小组的工人也热情帮助别人赶上自己。细纱乙班五组的工人干劲足，就是产量完成得不好，工人们很着急。相玉兰小组工人知道这个情况后，立即派组长相玉兰去帮助。相玉兰到五组后，同五组工人一块摇车、落纱、开会，发现五组产量低主要因为落纱工和挡车工团结协作不够好。经过她的帮助，五组工人加强了协作以后，也完成了生产计划。
    这个小组工人一面积极参加厂里小组之间的竞赛，同时也注意在组内开展各种形式的短距离关键竞赛。如落纱工的“对面车”竞赛和“降低空锭率”的竞赛，都促使小组工人互相学习，互相追赶，使生产关键问题一个个被突破，操作水平步步提高，保证了小组六年来月月超额完成国家生产计划。
