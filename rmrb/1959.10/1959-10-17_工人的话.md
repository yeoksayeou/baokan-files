Words of the Workers

	No Laggards Beside Advanced Producers
    "Strive harder and aim higher," we must always follow the Party's teachings, hold high the red flag of the General Line, overcome all difficulties, learn with humility, constantly summarize and accumulate experience, and continue to deeply develop the "compare, learn, catch up" emulation drive for increased production and thrift, ensuring that "there are no laggards beside advanced producers"; and wholeheartedly devote ourselves to the final battle of the fourth quarter, to fulfill and overfulfill the state plan even more excellently.
      Northwest No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, Cao Guifang

	Strive for First Place in Work
    Everyone should strive to be the best and aim for "first place" in their work; this can be included in one's plan; however, personal fame, rewards, and such things should not be included in the plan and should not be the purpose of our work. Only those who put personal fame, rewards, treatment, and even life aside, and wholeheartedly work for the Party and contribute all their strength to the revolutionary cause, should receive honor and can maintain honor for a long time. We should have this attitude when striving to be advanced producers.
      Shijingshan Power Plant, Liu Guangjin

	Perpetual Leap Forward
    Forever listen to the Party's words, forever advance in the direction pointed out by the Party; I want to advance perpetually together with all the workers in the group. On the basis of having already completed two and a half years' worth of work, we will complete another half year's worth of work by the end of the year, entering 1962.
        Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Hao Fu

    工人的话
　　先进生产者旁边没有落后人
    “干劲要一鼓再鼓、上游要一争再争”，我们要永远听从党的教导，高举总路线红旗，排除万难，虚心学习，不断地总结积累经验，继续深入开展“比、学、赶”增产节约竞赛，做到“先进生产者旁边没落后的人”；同心协力地投入第四季度决战，更出色地完成和超额完成国家计划。
      西北国棉一厂　曹桂芳
    在工作上争取第一名
    每个人都应该争上游，在工作上应该争取“第一名”，这都可以列入自己的计划；但是个人的名利、奖励这些东西却不列入计划，不能作为我们工作的目的。只有那些把个人名利、奖励、待遇以至于生命都置之度外，一心一意为党工作，为革命事业贡献自己全部力量的人，才应当得到荣誉，也才能长期保持荣誉。我们争取做先进生产者，应该抱这种态度。
      石景山发电厂　刘光金
    永远跃进
    永远听党的话，永远照着党所指引的方向前进；我要和小组全体工人一起，永远跃进。在目前已完成两年半工作量的基础上，到年底再完成半年工作量，跨入1962年。
        山西机床厂　郝福
