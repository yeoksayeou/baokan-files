Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Agricultural Ministry, Forestry Ministry, Water Conservancy and Electric Power Ministry, Agricultural Reclamation Ministry, Agricultural Machinery Ministry, Aquatic Products Ministry, and the Central Meteorological Bureau jointly invited more than 1,300 representatives of advanced units and labor model representatives on the agricultural front from various regions who came to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, to hold a three-day symposium from the 5th to the 7th. The symposium exchanged views on the current three autumn harvests, winter production and farmland capital construction, and striving for a greater leap forward next year.

Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave speeches. The representatives showed vigorous enthusiasm for the new upsurge of farmland capital construction and winter production that will be launched this winter, and on this basis, striving for a greater leap forward next year.

In his speech, Tan Zhenlin requested the agricultural front to strive for a great bumper harvest in the summer of next year and continue to walk in the forefront by raising the red flag of the Great Leap Forward. He pointed out that the Great Leap Forward since 1958 has been led by the bumper harvest of agricultural production, especially summer crops. Next year's summer wheat harvest will also be the key to the great leap forward in agricultural production next year, and will also promote the continued great leap forward in industry, culture, education, science, health, and other aspects. He also pointed out that in the task of striving for a great bumper harvest in the summer of next year, the south mainly strives for a bumper harvest of early rice. It is also very important for all regions to strive for a bumper harvest of summer miscellaneous grains and rapeseed. Regarding the current autumn harvest, he requested that all regions must accept last year's experience and achieve a bumper harvest. All crops must be harvested cleanly, dried well, and stored well, complete the requisition tasks well, and manage and use them well. When allocating grain, the production teams of all people's communes must reserve sufficient feed like they reserve sufficient rations, to ensure the great leap forward of large and small livestock and poultry next year. In addition to doing a good job in the three autumn tasks, he also requested that people's communes across the country vigorously develop diversified economy and sideline production in the fourth quarter, and further strive to increase income and increase the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries on the basis of the original plan. Regarding the issue of further improving the people's communes, he requested that all regions continue to conscientiously implement the provisions of the Central Committee's resolutions at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee last year to the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee this year, and hold the first member representative assembly this winter. Through airing views and ideological education, further improve the work style of cadres and further raise the consciousness of the masses.

Deng Zihui pointed out in his speech that the new year starting from now in agricultural production will achieve a greater and better leap forward than the past two years. He analyzed in detail the current "very good" political and economic situation in the country, and analyzed the origin of the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the people's communes. He said that farmland capital construction has greatly developed compared with 1957, the material foundation for developing production is much stronger, the people's communes are much superior to the advanced agricultural cooperatives at that time, and the experience accumulated in all aspects since the Great Leap Forward is also much richer. After the Eighth Plenary Session, through anti-rightist and boosting morale, rural cadres and the vast number of commune members have high morale. Continuing to eliminate right-leaning and negative emotions, it can be affirmed that next year's Great Leap Forward will be greater than in 1958. Then, he requested that the people's communes in all regions, starting this winter, vigorously carry out farmland capital construction such as water conservancy, pig raising, manure accumulation, and soil improvement. Water conservancy should ensure that each mu of paddy field has 800 to 1,000 cubic meters of water throughout the year, and dry land has 300 to 500 cubic meters; pig raising should reach one pig per person; do a good job in the current three autumn production work; do a good job in the long-term and next year's production plans for the communes; further improve agricultural tools for gradually realizing mechanization; and do a good job in autumn harvest distribution, running canteens and nurseries well, implementing democratic commune management and thrift commune management, and carrying out future education for the masses. In addition, he also requested that all regions strive to run advanced, state-owned farms under the ownership of the whole people well.

At the meeting, Li Shunda, Wang Guofan, Xu Jianchun, Hao Fengtang, Wu Fengqi, Zaxiang Jiji (Tibetan), Lu Weichuan, Li Molin, and other 23 representatives of advanced units and labor model representatives spoke successively, and more than 40 representatives made written speeches. They unanimously expressed their firm response to the call of the Party Central Committee, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they will implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose right-leaning and boost morale, and raise the red flag of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune even higher and forge ahead victoriously. They also firmly expressed that they will follow the opinions of Vice Premiers Tan Zhenlin and Deng Zihui, exert greater efforts, vigorously develop mass movements, grasp the current three autumn tasks well, achieve a bumper harvest, cultivate and sow well, vigorously develop animal husbandry, make animal husbandry rise faster, develop diversified operations, increase public accumulation and commune member income, and ensure the overfulfillment of this year's leap forward indicators for agricultural and sideline industries. They also stated that this winter, they will carry out a large amount of water conservancy construction, a large amount of fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing, and soil improvement work, laying a foundation for a greater leap forward next year and in the future.

Li Shunda, the famous national agricultural labor model and director of the Jinxing People's Commune in Pingshun County, Shanxi, said that under the encouragement of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all members of their commune have more confidence and greater enthusiasm. They have launched a vigorous three autumn production movement and have formulated a plan for a comprehensive leap forward next year. They are determined to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out capital construction, comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture," vigorously grasp tool reform, ensure the overfulfillment of this year's various production increase targets, and ensure the realization of a comprehensive leap forward next year.

Wang Guofan, the nationally famous agricultural labor model and director of the Jianming People's Commune in Xipu, Zunhua County, Hebei, said that the people's commune is doing extremely well. Last year, all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries achieved a great leap forward, and this year there will be a greater leap forward than last year. Recently, their commune, in the spirit of giving full play to their efforts and seeking truth from facts, formulated a three-year development plan for the future. He also expressed his determination to use the same energy as last year's large-scale steel production to launch a farmland water conservancy movement once again, and proposed to launch a friendship competition with all the people's communes in the country to see who will create greater achievements this winter and who will achieve a greater leap forward in production next year.

Xu Jianchun, the director of the Xiyou People's Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, said that they will continue to give full play to their efforts, strive for the upstream, and be determined to sow autumn wheat in a timely manner with good quality and quantity, and strengthen field management to strive for an average yield of 600 jin per mu next year, doubling the increase compared with this year.

Hao Fengtang, the representative of the Qinghai Delingha Farm, which has maintained the title of wheat yield per mu for two consecutive years, said that they will be neither arrogant nor impetuous, humbly learn from the advanced experiences of other units, and strive for a greater leap forward in wheat next year. Zaxiang Jiji, a Tibetan worker at the Lhasa July 1st Agricultural Experiment Station, said that the Party turned her from a serf into the master of the country. This time, she participated in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country and this symposium in Beijing, and personally saw the brilliant achievements of the great leap forward of the motherland, which encouraged her even more. She expressed that she will learn the advanced experience of all fraternal ethnic groups well and work hard to build the new Tibet of the motherland. Wu Fengqi, the director of the Shuguang People's Commune in Jilin, said that they must do a good job in the current three autumn tasks, harvest carefully, achieve a bumper harvest, and implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, improve management, do a good job in income distribution, and complete the requisition task well. Xu Xiuying, a labor model in Inner Mongolia, said that they will make all preparations for livestock to survive the winter and spring, and strengthen feeding management to achieve full fatness, and supplement the unfertilized female livestock to strive for full pregnancy, and ensure that the net increase of large and small livestock reaches 55% by the end of June next year. Lu Weichuan, the director of the Ant People's Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang, expressed his determination to produce more fish to support socialist construction and supply the needs of the urban people. Li Molin, the deputy director of the Sijiqing People's Commune in Beijing, said that they must better play the superiority of the people's commune and increase the production of more vegetables in the fourth quarter to supply the needs of the people in the capital.

Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, Wang Zhen, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation, Feng Zhongyun, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, Hui Zhongquan, Vice Minister of Forestry, Li Yu, Vice Minister of Agricultural Machinery, Jin Cheng, Vice Minister of Aquatic Products, and Rao Xing, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, also spoke at the meeting. Liao Luyan encouraged the representatives to give full play to their efforts, better play the superiority of the people's commune, and strive to overfulfill the planned targets for the total output value of agriculture this year, and make all preparations for a greater leap forward next year. To this end, he requested that political and ideological work, distribution work, labor management organization work, and life and welfare work of the people's commune be done well. Wang Zhen said in his speech that the Party and the state require the reclamation area and state-owned farms to increase the commodity rate and increase the quantity and variety of various commodities. Therefore, he requested that all state-owned farms strengthen the leadership of the Party, vigorously develop mass movements, carry out technological revolution, increase labor productivity, increase the commodity rate of agricultural and livestock products, and actively reclaim wasteland to expand the cultivated area and increase the yield per unit area. Feng Zhongyun said in his speech that a new upsurge of water conservancy construction will be launched this winter and next spring. In this upsurge, areas with fewer water conservancy projects should actively build a batch of new projects, and areas that have built many water conservancy projects should pay attention to improving and upgrading existing water conservancy facilities so that they can give full play to their benefits and ensure the leap forward in agricultural production. Hui Zhongquan said that the present is a good time for autumn afforestation, and we must promptly do a good job in the planning of afforestation land, preparation of seedlings, and arrangement of labor, and quickly launch a mass afforestation movement, fight hard in autumn and winter and next spring, and strive to overfulfill this year's afforestation tasks and next year's afforestation and replanting plans for previous missing seedlings and dead plants. Li Yu said that the agricultural machinery industry has made great progress in recent years, but it is still far from meeting the needs of agricultural development. Therefore, it is necessary to speed up the development of agricultural machinery, make a big fuss about technological revolution, resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs, and focus on improving agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools in the recent three or four years, while striving to continuously expand the production of modern agricultural machinery. Jin Cheng said that the task of aquatic product production in the fourth quarter is very arduous. Therefore, he requested that we vigorously grasp marine and freshwater fishing production, concentrate our efforts on grasping the production of large fishing seasons, and strengthen the later management of mature fish so that they can grow quickly and increase production. Rao Xing requested meteorological workers to improve the quality of their work, forecast the weather accurately and timely, and pay attention to giving full play to the role of the people's commune meteorological posts and sky-watching groups to ensure that the meteorological service for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing is done well so that the three autumn tasks can be carried out better.
