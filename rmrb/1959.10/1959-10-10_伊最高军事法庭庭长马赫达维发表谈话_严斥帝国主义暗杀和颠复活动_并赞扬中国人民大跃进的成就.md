Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Iraqi Supreme Special Military Court President, Colonel Fadhil Abbas Mahdawi, today in Beijing, strongly condemned the despicable acts of imperialism in attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Qasim and subvert the Republic of Iraq.

He told the Xinhua News Agency reporter who interviewed him, "We know that imperialists, spies, secret agents, saboteurs, and conspirators are carrying out assassination plots and activities to subvert the Republic of Iraq, and we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance. We are fighting for the liberation of our nation, the independence of our country, and the freedom of our people. We are not afraid of death. We will stand firm and exist forever."

Colonel Mahdawi emphasized that in the face of imperialism, the Iraqi people should unite into a strong force. He said that the various democratic forces in Iraq, standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, should be further strengthened.

He said: "There must be no tolerance for reactionary forces. No matter where in our country, conspirators should be monitored day and night, to help the government hunt down the criminals in this incident and defend our only leader Qasim and the Republic of Iraq."

Colonel Mahdawi recounted the endless subversive activities carried out by imperialism against Iraq since the establishment of the Republic of Iraq on July 14 last year. He listed the treasonous events of Arif, Gailani, Shawwaf, and others. He said: "We have crushed these conspiracies. They suffered shameful defeats."

Colonel Mahdawi pointed out that victory belongs to the people, not to any imperialism; that the people of all countries have the right to determine their own destiny; and that the friendship between the people of all countries in the world and sincere cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit should endure forever.

Colonel Mahdawi deeply thanked the Chinese leaders for their deep concern about Prime Minister Qasim's assassination attempt and injury. He said: "I have seen the great concern shown by the great and friendly Chinese people for this matter, a concern that is revealed on people's faces. Some Chinese friends have also called me to express their concern."

Colonel Mahdawi highly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. He said that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind and will continue to prevail over the West Wind in the future. He said, "This is the East Wind for all of us, it brings together our hearts, our thoughts, and our noble humanitarian spirit."

He said that during this visit to China, he "personally witnessed your amazing Great Leap Forward, saw your efforts to go all out, aim high, and achieve brilliant results in all aspects of heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, science, culture, and technology. From these aspects, I clearly know how much wealth you have created and how much power you have exerted. You are striding forward continuously, like the rising sun."

Colonel Mahdawi said, "I would especially like to mention the People's Communes, which have completely liberated women, who today work alongside men."

Colonel Mahdawi said enthusiastically, "I admire the tremendous progress you have made in all aspects since liberation, I admire your noble qualities and infinite power, and I admire your boundless loyalty to the national leaders and the people."

He expressed his firm belief that the friendship, cooperation, and unity between Iraq and China will continue to develop and consolidate in the future, and this friendship, cooperation, and unity will be manifested in economic, cultural, scientific, and other fields.

    严斥帝国主义暗杀和颠复活动
    并赞扬中国人民大跃进的成就
    新华社9日讯　伊拉克最高特别军事法庭庭长法齐勒·阿巴斯·马赫达维上校今天在北京严厉斥责帝国主义企图暗杀卡塞姆总理、颠复伊拉克共和国的卑鄙行径。
    他对访问他的新华社记者说：“我们知道帝国主义、间谍、特务分子、破坏分子、阴谋分子在进行暗杀阴谋和颠复伊拉克共和国的活动，我们要永远保持高度的警惕。我们为了我们民族的解放、祖国的独立、人民的自由而进行斗争。我们不怕死。我们将屹立不动地存在着。”
    马赫达维上校强调，在帝国主义面前，伊拉克全国人民应该结成一支强有力的队伍。他说，站在反帝斗争前列的伊拉克国内各种民主力量都应该进一步加强。
    他说：“对于反动势力，决不能宽容。无论在我国什么地方，都应该日夜监视阴谋分子，帮助政府搜捕这次事件的罪犯，保卫我们唯一的领袖卡塞姆和伊拉克共和国。”
    马赫达维上校追述了自从去年7月14日伊拉克共和国成立以来，帝国主义对于伊拉克所进行的层出不穷的颠复活动。他列举了阿里夫、盖拉尼、沙瓦夫等叛国事件。他说：“我们粉碎了这些阴谋。他们遭到了可耻的失败。”
    马赫达维上校指出，胜利是属于人民的，而不属于任何帝国主义；各国人民有权决定自己的命运；世界各国人民之间的友谊以及在平等互利的基础上进行真诚的合作应该永存。
    马赫达维上校深深感谢中国领导人对于卡塞姆总理遇刺受伤所表示的深切关怀。他说：“我看到了伟大的、友好的中国人民对这件事情所表示的很大的关心，这种关心流露在人们的脸上。还有些中国朋友打电话给我，表示关心。”
    马赫达维上校十分赞扬中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。他说，东风已经压倒了西风，而且今后要继续压倒西风。他说：“这是我们大家的东风，它把我们的心、我们的思想、我们的崇高的人道主义的精神汇聚在一起。”
    他说，这次到中国来，他“亲眼看到了你们惊人的大跃进，看到了你们鼓足干劲、力争上游，在重工业、轻工业、农业、科学、文化、技术等各方面都取得了辉煌的成绩。从这些方面，我清楚地知道你们创造了多么丰硕的财富，你们发挥了何等巨大的力量。你们在大踏步不断前进，如旭日东升。”
    马赫达维上校说：“我特别要提到的是人民公社，它使妇女得到了彻底的解放，她们今天同男子并肩劳动。”
    马赫达维上校热情地说：“我敬佩你们在解放后所获得的各方面的巨大进步，我敬佩你们崇高的品质和无穷的力量，我敬佩你们对国家领导人和人民的无限忠诚。”
    他表示深信伊拉克和中国的友谊、合作与团结在今后将会不断地发展和巩固，这种友谊、合作与团结表现在经济、文化、科学等各个方面。
