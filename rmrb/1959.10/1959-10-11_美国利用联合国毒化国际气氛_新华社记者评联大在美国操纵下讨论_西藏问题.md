　　The United States Uses the United Nations to Poison the International Atmosphere
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the UN General Assembly Discussing the "Tibet Issue" Under US Manipulation
    Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: A commentary by a reporter from this agency:
    The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed the recommendation on the 9th to include the so-called Tibet issue on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. Another ugly farce directed by US imperialism, slandering and interfering in China's internal affairs, and poisoning the international atmosphere, has begun at the United Nations.
    It was Ireland and Malaya who raised the so-called Tibet issue at the United Nations, but in reality, their main behind-the-scenes wire-puller was the US State Department, which is no longer a secret. Since the quelling of the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local upper-class reactionary clique in March this year, powerful groups in the United States have been planning to use the United Nations again to oppose China. Before the opening of the 14th United Nations General Assembly, the United Press International repeatedly reported from Washington that US government officials repeatedly expressed in late August and early September their "hope that an Asian country would raise the Tibet issue to the United Nations." These officials also explained that the United States dared not come forward itself because it feared that the United States itself "taking the initiative" would "cause the people of neutralist countries to regard this matter as merely a means of Cold War propaganda and not pay attention to it." In order to find mouthpieces, the United States launched very intense activities inside and outside the United Nations. On September 17, US Secretary of State Herter clamored at the 14th United Nations General Assembly that the United Nations "must express its attitude in clear terms" on the so-called Tibet issue. On the 22nd, Herter told the United Nations Correspondents Association that this issue "is likely to be put on [the UN General Assembly agenda]" and must be "arranged properly" first. On September 28, Ireland and Malaya formally raised this issue to the United Nations, and the spokesperson for the US delegation to the United Nations immediately expressed full support. Although the representatives of Ireland and Malaya, who acted as pawns, evaded and tried their best to deny that their actions were "dependent on any group," US imperialism has already made everything so nakedly obvious. British imperialism, which had long invaded Chinese Tibet, also actively participated in the US's dirty tricks.
    The imperialists are doing everything possible to stir up anti-China clamor in the United Nations, which makes people see even more that the armed rebellion of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet has a broad international background. After the end of World War II, US imperialism actively attempted to intervene in the Chinese Tibet region, which was originally invaded by British imperialism. In 1948 and 1949, when the Chinese People's Liberation War was winning a complete victory, the US and British imperialists colluded with Tibetan upper-class reactionaries to create the so-called "Tibetan independence" conspiracy, attempting to split Tibet from the motherland and turn it into an imperialist colony. After the Chinese people began to march into Tibet in 1950, the United States instructed El Salvador to raise the so-called Tibet issue to the Fifth United Nations General Assembly, attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory. However, these despicable tricks of the imperialists did not succeed. After the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet launched an armed rebellion in March this year, the US State Department impatiently issued several statements in succession, expressing "deep sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels. After the rebellion was quickly quelled, Parsons, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, also declared with gnashing teeth on June 28 this year that the US government "will continue to seek some practical ways to assist" the Tibetan rebels.
    However, all of this cannot change the historical fact that Tibet belongs to China and the historical inevitable trend of the Tibetan people's urgent need for development. The UN Charter clearly stipulates that it shall not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The UN's discussion of such a purely Chinese internal affair is a blatant trampling on the Charter. The United States has long tarnished the banner of the United Nations in the Korean War, and the United States has already created many shameful records of being hostile to the Chinese people in the United Nations. If the United Nations Organization allows the United States and its accomplices to run amok, it will only make the United Nations Organization even more discredited.
    At a time when the international situation has recently shown a trend of relaxation, the US arrangement to discuss the so-called Tibet issue in the United Nations particularly clearly shows that powerful groups in the United States are preventing the relaxation of the international situation and are doing everything possible to intensify the "Cold War." The US's behavior in the United Nations, the US's behavior in instigating and expanding the civil war in Laos, and the US's behavior in slandering China everywhere and provoking discord in the relations between Asian and African countries all show that although some people in the United States have recently been paying lip service to wishing for peace and wishing to melt the ice, they are actually continuing to create tension.
    The imperialists' manipulation of the United Nations to discuss the so-called Tibet issue will not get them anything except to thoroughly expose their faces. All self-respecting member states of the United Nations should distinguish between right and wrong, weigh the pros and cons, and not put themselves in a position that is contrary to the UN Charter and antagonistic to the Chinese people.

### 美国利用联合国毒化国际气氛  新华社记者评联大在美国操纵下讨论“西藏问题”

　　美国利用联合国毒化国际气氛
    新华社记者评联大在美国操纵下讨论“西藏问题”
    新华社10日讯　本社记者述评：
    联合国大会总务委员会在9日通过把所谓西藏问题列入联大议程的建议。美帝国主义一手导演的又一出污蔑和干涉中国内政、毒化国际气氛的丑剧，在联合国里粉墨登场了。
    在联合国里提出所谓西藏问题的是爱尔兰和马来亚，但实际上它们的主要幕后牵线人是美国国务院，这早已不是秘密。从今年3月中国平定西藏地方上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱以后，美国有势力集团一直策划要再次利用联合国来反对中国。在第十四届联合国大会开幕以前，合众国际社接连从华盛顿报道，美国政府官员们在8月底和9月初一再表示“希望有亚洲国家向联合国提出西藏问题”，这些官员并且解释美国不敢自己出面提出，是由于担心美国自己“采取主动”
  “会使中立主义国家的人民认为这件事仅仅是一种冷战宣传手段而不予重视”。美国为了找寻传声筒，在联合国内外展开了十分紧张的活动。9月17日，美国国务卿赫脱在第十四届联合国大会上叫嚷联合国在所谓西藏问题上“必须以明确的措词表明自己的态度”，22日赫脱在联合国记者协会又声称这个问题“很可能会列进（联大议程）去”，要先“安排妥当”。9月28日，爱尔兰和马来亚便正式向联合国提出这个问题，美国出席联合国代表团发言人马上表示完全支持。尽管充当走卒的爱尔兰和马来亚代表躲躲闪闪，竭力否认他们的行动“是对任何集团的依附”，但是美帝国主义却已经把一切都弄得如此赤裸裸的了。长期侵略过中国西藏的英帝国主义，也积极参与了美国的龌龊勾当。
    帝国主义者千方百计地要在联合国里掀起反对中国的叫嚣，使人们更加可以看到，西藏上层反动集团的那场武装叛乱是有着广泛的国际背景的。美帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束以后，就积极企图插足原来受英帝国主义侵略的中国西藏地方。1948年和1949年中国人民解放战争全面胜利的时候，美英帝国主义曾经勾结西藏上层反动分子，制造过所谓“西藏独立”的阴谋，想把西藏从祖国割裂出去，变为帝国主义殖民地。1950年中国人民开始进军西藏以后，美国又曾经指使萨尔瓦多向第五届联合国大会提出过所谓西藏问题，妄图阻止中国人民解放自己的领土。但是，帝国主义这些卑鄙伎俩都没有得逞。到今年3月西藏上层反动集团发动武装叛乱后，美国国务院又急不可待地连续发表好几个声明，对西藏叛乱分子表示“深切的同情”。在叛乱被迅速平息下去后，美国负责远东事务助理国务卿帕森斯今年6月28日还咬牙切齿地宣称，美国政府“将继续寻求一些实际可行的办法来援助”西藏叛乱分子。
    然而，所有这些都丝毫也不能改变西藏属于中国这一历史事实和西藏人民迫切要求发展的历史必然趋势。联合国宪章明确规定不得干涉各国内部事务，联合国讨论这样纯属中国内政的问题就是对宪章的公然践踏。美国在侵略朝鲜战争中早就玷污了联合国的旗帜，美国在联合国里已经制造了不少与中国人民为敌的可耻记录。联合国组织如果听任美国及其帮凶胡闹下去，只会使得联合国组织更加威信扫地。
    在国际局势最近出现缓和趋向的时候，美国安排在联合国里讨论所谓西藏问题，特别明显地说明，美国有势力集团在阻止国际局势缓和，竭力加剧“冷战”。美国在联合国里的行为，美国在老挝挑动和扩大内战的行为，美国到处诬蔑中国、挑拨离间亚非国家关系的行为，这一切都说明，美国一些人士最近虽然口头上说着愿望和平、愿望融解冰块一类的漂亮话，实际上正在继续制造紧张局势。
    帝国主义者操纵联合国讨论所谓西藏问题，除了彻底暴露他们的面目以外，他们是什么也不会得到的。一切自重的联合国会员国应当明辨是非，权衡利害，不要使自己处于同联合国宪章相违背、同中国人民相对立的地位。
