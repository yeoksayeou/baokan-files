　　The Dead Soul of Washington
　　By a commentator of this newspaper
    The Ministerial Council meeting of the Central Treaty Organization concluded on the 9th after three days of meetings. The so-called Central Treaty Organization is actually the resurrected corpse of the Baghdad Pact group without Baghdad. As everyone knows, the Baghdad Pact was an aggressive tool cobbled together in the Middle East by the US and Britain in 1955 and manipulated behind the scenes by the United States. This notorious group, under the guise of opposing "communist infiltration," specialized in suppressing national independence movements in the Middle East and splitting the unity of Arab countries. Not long ago, the United States replaced it with the signboard of the "Central Treaty Organization." The first Council meeting after the treaty was renamed was held in Washington, the capital of the United States, indicating that the United States' control over this treaty organization even exceeds its control over the already dissolved Baghdad Pact. Although the United States nominally did not participate in the Central Treaty Organization, it sent a large delegation headed by Secretary of State Herter to attend the Council meeting, actually becoming the master of the meeting. Member states of the treaty did not shy away from this. British Ambassador to the United States, Caccia, openly declared that "the United States' connection with this organization is no different from the connection it would have maintained if it had signed the original treaty."

    During this meeting, US Secretary of State Herter and the US's vassal states tried their best to reiterate the clichés of so-called "communist threats and aggression." Herter, using the excuse that the communists "want to undermine" the "security and independence" of Middle Eastern countries, incited member states of the Central Treaty Organization to continue to follow the US's policy of arms expansion and war preparation. Central Treaty Organization Secretary-General Begh also, at the behest of his master, greatly slandered the Soviet Union's so-called "subversive activities" in Iran, and so on, at the meeting. All of this shows that US imperialism is intensifying the Cold War atmosphere in this part of the world and hindering the situation from moving towards détente.

    However, the facts are the most stubborn. The people of the Middle East and Arab countries can see very clearly, who has been and still is undermining the "security and independence" of the Middle East and Arab countries? Isn't it the United States and Britain and other Western colonial countries that are seizing the oil wealth of the Middle Eastern countries? And isn't it US imperialism itself that has established aggressive military bases on the territories of Middle Eastern countries? The United States is re-hanging the tattered "anti-communist" black flag, picked up from the ruins of the Baghdad Pact organization, on the new signboard of the Central Treaty Organization to cover up the essence of this treaty organization, which is obviously a futile effort. Central Treaty Organization Secretary-General Begh admitted in his opening remarks at the meeting that the main task of the treaty organization is to defend the "free world's" oil interests in the Middle East. This should be said to be a relatively frank confession. As is well known, the United States, starting at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century, has been waving the banner of the "Open Door" policy. For decades, especially after the Second World War, it has gradually squeezed out British colonial forces in the Middle East and seized the vast majority of the Middle East's oil wealth. The United States' share of oil in the Middle East now accounts for more than 60%. And Britain still maintains a portion of oil interests in the Persian Gulf. Every year, staggering profits from hundreds of millions of tons of oil flow into the pockets of US and British oil monopoly capitalists. Therefore, the so-called "defense" of Middle Eastern oil actually means: in order to prevent colonial countries such as the US and Britain from losing their oil profits in the Middle East, it is necessary to carry out destruction and suppression of the national liberation movements of the people of the Middle Eastern countries. The so-called Central Treaty Organization is exactly the same in nature as the Baghdad Pact Organization, and is still a sinister tool for US imperialism to carry out plunder and expansion in the Middle East.

    Although this Washington meeting of the Central Treaty Organization Council was conducted in secret, it can be seen from the disclosed news and the meeting's communiqué that the main issues discussed by the planners of this treaty organization and its servants were how to organize a new offensive against the national independence of Middle Eastern countries, especially Arab countries. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes proposed at the meeting to establish a "command headquarters" within this aggressive group, which will become the main military organization at a certain time. The meeting communiqué has announced the establishment of a "permanent military representative group," which will begin operations in Ankara on January 1 next year. And this military institution will have an American general as chief of staff. This means that US imperialism is conspiring to unify the army of this aggressive group under the direct control of the United States, turning it into cannon fodder for the United States to launch aggressive wars in the Middle East. At the same time, under the cry of the so-called "subversive threat," the meeting communiqué revealed that US imperialism is painstakingly planning new conspiracies to subvert the legitimate governments of Middle Eastern countries that safeguard national independence and suppress the movements of the people of Middle Eastern countries to strive for national independence. At this very moment, an assassination attempt occurred against Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim on the streets of Baghdad, which of course was no accident. Baghdad Radio on October 11 has pointed out that the people who shot at Prime Minister Qasim a few days ago were a group of traitorous imperialist agents. The gunshots fired by these conspirators on the streets of Baghdad fully demonstrated the aggressive group's mad hostility towards the newly born Republic of Iraq.

    The people of the Middle East have long recognized from their own experiences in the past few years that the Baghdad Pact is a shackle on the Arab people. Now this dead soul, which disappeared due to the victory of the Iraqi People's Revolution, has reappeared in Washington. This Washington meeting of the Central Treaty Organization Ministerial Council is a signal of the US's new conspiracy against the people of the Middle East and Arab countries, and therefore cannot but arouse a hundredfold vigilance among the people of the Middle East and Arab countries.

　　华盛顿的死魂灵
　　本报评论员
    中央条约组织部长理事会会议在经过了为时三天的会议以后，已于9日结束。所谓中央条约组织，其实就是没有了巴格达的巴格达条约集团的借尸还魂。谁都知道，巴格达条约集团是在1955年由美英在中东拼凑起来、而由美国在幕后操纵的侵略性工具。这个以所谓反对“共产主义渗透”为名、专门镇压中东民族独立运动和分裂阿拉伯国家团结的臭名昭彰的集团，不久以前才被美国换上“中央条约组织”的招牌。条约改名后的第一次理事会会议在美国的首都华盛顿举行，表明了美国对于这一条约组织的控制甚至超过了它对已经解体的巴格达条约的控制。尽管美国名义上没有参加中央条约组织，它却派了以国务卿赫脱为首的庞大的代表团出席了这次理事会会议，实际上成为会议的主宰。条约的成员国家对此并不讳言。英国驻美大使加西亚公开宣称“美国同这个组织的联系已经不差于如果它签订原先的条约情况下保持的联系。”
    在这次会议中，美国国务卿赫脱和美国的仆从国竭力重弹所谓“共产主义威胁和侵略”的滥调，赫脱以共产党“想要破坏”中东各国的“安全和独立”为借口，鼓动中央条约组织成员国继续追随美国的扩军备战政策。中央条约组织秘书长贝格也在会议上按照他的主子的意图大肆污蔑苏联对伊朗的所谓“颠覆活动”等等。这一切都说明，美国帝国主义正在世界的这一部分地区加剧冷战空气，阻挠局势走向缓和。
    但是，事实是最顽强的，中东和阿拉伯各国人民看得很清楚，究竟是谁已经而且仍在破坏中东和阿拉伯各国的“安全和独立”呢？难道不是美国和英国等西方殖民国家霸占着中东各国的石油财富；又难道不是美帝国主义自己在中东国家的领土上建立了侵略性的军事基地的吗？美国把在巴格达条约组织的废墟上捡起来的这面破烂的“反共”黑旗重新挂在中央条约组织的新的招牌上，以掩盖这个条约组织的实质，显然是枉费心机的。中央条约组织的秘书长贝格在会议的开场白中就承认，条约组织的主要任务是要保卫“自由世界”在中东的石油利益。这应该说是比较坦率的招供。如所周知的，美国从上世纪末和本世纪初开始打起“门户开放”的旗号，数十年来，特别是在第二次世界大战以后，已经逐步地排挤掉英国在中东的殖民势力，而攫取了绝大部分中东的石油财富。美国在中东的石油分额现在已经占到60％以上了。而英国在波斯湾还保持着一部分石油利益。每年，上亿吨石油的惊人利润流进美英石油垄断资本家的腰包。因此，所谓“保卫”中东石油，其真实的含意即是：为了防止美英等殖民国家丧失在中东的石油利润，必须对中东各国人民的民族解放运动实行破坏和镇压。所谓中央条约组织同巴格达条约组织的性质完全一样，仍然是美帝国主义在中东进行掠夺和扩张的一个罪恶的工具。
    尽管这次中央条约组织理事会的华盛顿会议是秘密进行的，但从已经透露的消息和会议的公报也可以看出，这个条约组织的策划者和它的仆从们所讨论的主要问题是如何组织对中东各国，尤其是阿拉伯各国的民族独立的新的进攻。土耳其总理曼德列斯在会议上就提出要在这个侵略集团内成立一个“司令部”，并且它到一定时候将成为主要军事组织。会议公报已经宣布成立一个“常设军事代表小组”，将在明年1月1日在安卡拉开始活动。而这个军事机构将由一个美国将军充当参谋长。这就是说，美帝国主义正阴谋把这个侵略集团的军队统一在美国的直接控制之下，变成美国在中东发动侵略战争的炮灰。同时，会议公报在所谓“颠覆威胁”的叫嚷下，透露了美帝国主义正在处心积虑策划颠覆中东维护民族独立国家的合法政府和镇压中东各国人民争取民族独立的运动的新的阴谋。正在这个时候，巴格达街头发生了阴谋刺杀伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆的事件，这当然不是偶然的。10月11日巴格达电台已经指出，前几天开枪射击卡塞姆总理的就是一群叛国的帝国主义特务分子。这些阴谋分子在巴格达街头发出的枪声，充分地表明了侵略集团对于新生的伊拉克共和国的疯狂的敌意。
    中东人民早从过去几年切身的经历中，认识到巴格达条约是阿拉伯人民的枷锁。现在这个由于伊拉克人民革命的胜利而消声匿迹的死魂灵又重新在华盛顿出现了。这次在华盛顿举行的中央条约组织部长理事会会议，正是美国对中东和阿拉伯各国人民新阴谋的信号，因此不能不引起中东和阿拉伯各国人民的百倍警惕。
