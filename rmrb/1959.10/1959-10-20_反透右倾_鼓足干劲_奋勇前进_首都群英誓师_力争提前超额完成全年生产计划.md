Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: More than 6,200 representatives of advanced units and advanced producers on the capital's economic front gathered today at the Great Hall of the People to pledge their determination. They unanimously expressed their resolve to fight hard in the final seventy days of this year, joining with all the city's workers to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the annual production tasks fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule, and to actively prepare conditions for an even greater leap forward next year.

The Beijing Municipal Conference of Representatives of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade lasted for one day and closed this afternoon. Responsible persons from various factories, mines, and enterprises, representatives from the cultural, educational, and health sectors, family members of workers, and representatives of capitalists from joint state-private enterprises, totaling more than 2,000 people, attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Mayor of Beijing.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, a large number of advanced units and advanced producers have emerged on all fronts of production and construction in the capital. With high levels of enthusiasm and creativity, they have made brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, more than 7,700 advanced collectives and nearly 60,000 advanced producers have emerged throughout the city this year, plus youth red banner bearers, totaling more than 110,000 people.

At today's Leap Forward rally, twenty-one representatives of advanced production units and advanced producers stated in their speeches that they would resolutely guarantee the completion of this year's production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule, and dedicate even more brilliant production achievements to the National "Conference of Heroes." The representative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company Casting Plant, which won the title of Beijing's Red Flag in the Casting Industry, said that in the first nine months of this year, the plant completed 130.1% of the state plan for cast iron pipes and iron castings, and the scrap rate dropped from 3.13% at the beginning of the year to 1.52%. All the plant's workers are now moving forward at full speed, determined to complete the annual plan two months and five days ahead of schedule, and to increase the production of high-quality cast iron pipes by 10,000 tons for the country. Zhou Fengming, representative of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, said that all the factory's workers have expressed their determination to remain modest and prudent, to learn from fraternal factories with humility, and to complete the fourth quarter's production tasks twenty days ahead of schedule. Zhong Youzhi, representative of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Locomotive Crew No. 1588 of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, said that under the slogan of "fighting hard in the fourth quarter, overcoming wind, snow, and severe cold, and comprehensively overfulfilling the October transportation tasks," all the crew members have already taken active action, proposing to guarantee a cumulative safe driving distance of more than 1.12 million kilometers in October, saving more than 50 tons of coal, and hauling more goods faster, to prepare a good "starting point" for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. Cui Guangcheng, representative of the Tianqiao Department Store, a red flag on the national commercial front, said that all employees have launched a new upsurge of red flag competition with greater enthusiasm, determined to strengthen business and technical learning, comprehensively improve service quality, and strive to have seventeen salespersons reach the city's highest level in technical aspects such as measuring cloth and bundling by the end of the year. Zhang Baifa, a pacesetter on the basic construction front who made great contributions to the great project of the Great Hall of the People, introduced his experiences in the Great Leap Forward. He said that as long as we continue to liberate our minds, promote the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, establish a communist attitude towards labor, and promote the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, we can guarantee the continued leap forward at high speed. He, on behalf of all the shock troops in the team, guaranteed to the Party and the people: we will definitely listen to the Party's words, learn from fraternal teams and groups with humility, and continuously improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, so as to create greater achievements in the struggle to build the capital into a modern industrial city.

Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report at the meeting. After detailing the excellent situation on the city's economic front, the report pointed out: the fourth quarter is a decisive quarter. All employees must further implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly oppose Rightist tendencies, and exert full energy; prevent and overcome complacency and slackness, adhere to putting politics in command, and continuously develop the current city-wide movement of increasing production and practicing economy, to guarantee the completion of the annual production plan half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule. At the same time, we must also actively make full preparations for production in the first quarter of next year, and try every possible means to ensure that the production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year, and strive to exceed the fourth quarter of this year. In order to achieve this goal, we must continue to carry out the socialist competition movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Our slogan is: compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and make ourselves advanced. We must further carry out large-scale technical revolution and technical innovation movements, and promote effective advanced experiences at the fastest speed.

The report pointed out that advanced producers in the city should further play their roles as backbones, leaders, and bridges. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to make progress, whereas conceit makes one lag behind." The National "Conference of Heroes" will be held in Beijing soon. We must make full use of this opportunity to learn from all advanced units and advanced figures across the country, and greatly improve the ideological and technical levels of all employees in Beijing.

The meeting finally elected 182 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers to attend the National "Conference of Heroes."

During the meeting, employees on all fronts of production and construction in the city listened to the live broadcast of the meeting. The call of the Municipal Party Committee and the pledges of the advanced producers added new encouragement to the millions of employees in the city. All employees were invigorated and full of energy, determined to launch a new upsurge of even greater leaps forward with practical actions to break personal quotas and overfulfill plans.
