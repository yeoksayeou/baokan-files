    匈足球队——河北足球队
    一比一踢成平局
    新华社天津2日电  一万一千多名欢度国庆节假日的天津观众，今天观看了匈牙利国家足球队第二队和河北省足球队进行的友谊比赛，结果两队以一比一踢成平局。
    河北省足球队是第一届全国运动会足球亚军，今天比赛开始后即展开了猛烈的进攻，前七分钟曾几次逼近客队的禁区，并连发两次角球，但对方的后卫和守门员防守严密，没有奏效。技术熟练的匈牙利国家足球队第二队随即发动反攻。上半场一比零，客队领先。
    下半场，客队攻势仍然很猛，河北队门前几次出现险球，都经守门员曾雪麟救出。以后河北队积极进行反攻，双方形成拉锯战。结果，主客以一比一踢和。
    今天在比赛前，举行了欢迎匈牙利国家足球队第二队运动员的仪式。球赛结束后，河北省副省长高树勋接见了两国运动员。
