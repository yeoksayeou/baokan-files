    I Also Celebrate
    [Nepal] Xidi·Jialan·Xileishi
    Ah, China, I am filled with joy,
    With congratulations as a gift,
    Watching the golden dawn
    Breaking through the darkness.
    Your smiling face
    Radiates the light of world peace,
    Having shed the old and tattered shell,
    You have put on a new appearance,
    Filling every heart with confidence.
    Now you have stood up,
    Becoming messengers of world peace,
    What happy songs you sing
    —melodious and endlessly resounding.
    Ah, China, how dearly you cherish
    This liberation—
    It was a treasure lost for a long time,
    Regained only after many hardships.
    Ah, your liberation has shone brightly,
    You even forget to eat and sleep, abandoning enjoyment,
    To multiply the brilliant achievements,
    Astonishing the whole world.
    Your joyous celebration,
    Displays the freedom gained and the strength enhanced,
    It stirs echoes in every heart,
    Bringing an evergreen spring.
    Your celebration,
    Is a source of unparalleled joy,
    Because you are advancing on the road of labor, each doing their part,
    Bringing the bright goal ever closer.
    Today, every Asian heart is greatly broadened,
    The night of weeping and despair has passed,
    The morning song of hope is already singing.
    Why should I not regard this festival as my own victory?
    I want to sing in unison with you,
    And dance in step with you.
    In the wave of your celebratory victory,
    Standing like a leader such as Mao Zedong,
    Who has been tested for a long time and dedicated himself to the masses,
    I also obtained joy and happiness in this wave.
            (Translated by Chen Yaoguang)

    我也庆祝
    〔尼泊尔〕　西狄·嘉拉恩·希雷士塔
    啊，中国，我满怀喜悦，
    以祝贺作为礼物，
    注视着冲破黑夜的
    金色的黎明。
    你那满脸笑容，
    焕发着世界和平的光芒，
    脱去了破旧褴褛的外壳，
    你已换上了新的容貌，
    使每颗心里充满了信心。
    现在你们已经站立起来，
    成为世界和平的信使，
    你们唱着多么幸福的歌曲
    ——婉转动听，回响不绝。
    啊，中国，你是多么珍爱
    这次解放——
    它曾是一颗丢失了很久的珍宝，
    历尽艰辛才又获到。
    啊，你的解放已显出光芒，
    你们甚至废寝忘餐，撇弃享受，
    使辉煌的成就成倍地增大，
    震惊了全世界。
    你们这场欢乐的庆祝，
    显示着所获得的自由和增强的力量，
    它在每一颗心中激起回音，
    带来了长青不逝的春天。
    你们的这场庆祝，
    是无比欢乐的泉源，
    因为你们是在各尽其职的劳动的道路上前进，
    使光明的目标越临越近。
    今天每一个亚洲人胸怀都大为宽广，
    哭泣和绝望的黑夜已经逝去，
    希望的晨歌已在歌唱。
    为什么我不应该把这个节日当作我自己的胜利？
    我要和你们同声歌唱，
    和你们齐步舞蹈。
    在你们欢庆胜利的浪潮中，
    站着像毛泽东那样的领袖，
    他久经考验，献身给人民大众，
    我也在这浪潮中获得了欢乐和幸福。
            （陈尧光译）
