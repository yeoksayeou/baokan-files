The two governments' cultural cooperation plan for the fourth quarter of 1959 was signed at the same time.

Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, signed the agreement on behalf of the Chinese government, and Barry Diawandou, Minister of Education of the Republic of Guinea, signed the agreement on behalf of the Guinean government.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the signing ceremony.

The agreement states that the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Republic of Guinea, having decided to establish formal diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level, are willing to establish and develop cultural relations and cooperation between the two countries. To this end, the two governments have decided to sign a cultural cooperation agreement in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of mutual respect for national cultures.

The agreement stipulates that the two countries will cooperate in education, culture and art, news and broadcasting, science, medicine and health, sports, and other fields.

This agreement will come into effect after being ratified by the two governments and notified to each other.

According to the two governments' cultural cooperation plan for the fourth quarter of 1959, the Chinese government will accept ten students sent by the Guinean government in 1959 and grant them scholarships. The Guinean government will send a mass education study group to visit China. China will send an acrobatics troupe to Guinea for a performance tour in December 1959.

Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke at the signing ceremony, warmly congratulating the new development of friendly relations between China and Guinea on behalf of the Chinese government. He said that the peoples of China and Guinea have always been concerned with each other, supported each other, and closely linked together in the struggle to win and safeguard independence and freedom. Now that China and Guinea have formally established diplomatic relations, this has brought the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea into a new stage.

He also said that China's cultural exchanges and cooperation with other countries are carried out and developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit. Cultural exchanges and cooperation based on this spirit are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of all countries, conducive to the development and prosperity of each other's national cultures, and conducive to the consolidation of world peace, which is in the interests of the peoples of all countries. The cultural cooperation agreement signed by the governments of China and Guinea is formulated in accordance with this spirit.

Minister Diawandou said in his speech that he was pleased that the agreement was signed during the celebration of the national days of the two countries. He pointed out that this agreement is the first diplomatic action after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. This agreement opens a new era of cooperation between the people of Black Africa and the Chinese people.

He warmly congratulated the Chinese government and Chairman Mao Zedong on the great achievements China has made in the past ten years. He said that this provides an example for countries that have already achieved sovereignty but are still backward.
