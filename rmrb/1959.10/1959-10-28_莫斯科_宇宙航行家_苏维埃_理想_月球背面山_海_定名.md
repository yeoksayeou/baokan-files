Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: News from Soviet scientific circles states that Soviet scientists have named some mountains, "seas," and other features on the far side of the moon.

The "annular sea" located north of the lunar far side equator (between 20 and 30 degrees latitude, and between 140 and 160 degrees west longitude), with a diameter of approximately 300 kilometers, has been named "Mare Moscoviense" (Sea of Moscow). The bay in the southern part of this sea has been named "Cosmonauts Bay."

In the southern hemisphere of the far side of the moon, there is an annular mountain with a diameter of over 100 kilometers, which has been named "Tsiolkovsky Crater." This annular mountain has a central hill.

North of the lunar equator, almost at the boundary between the visible and invisible sides of the moon, there are two large annular mountains, which have been named "Lomonosov Crater" and "Joliot-Curie Crater" respectively. To the south of these two annular mountains, close to the equator, extends a large mountain range, which has been named "Soviet Mountains."

A sea on the southern hemisphere of the lunar far side, near the edge of the lunar surface, has been named "Mare Desiderii" (Sea of ​​Ideal).

These first names were decided after the Earth received photos of the far side of the moon sent back by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station. These photos were taken on October 7th. Scientific circles pointed out that only objects that could be confidently identified during the initial study of the photos were named.

The Soviet Academy of Sciences has established a committee for naming annular mountains, mountain ranges, and other objects on the far side of the moon.

According to scientists, a small part of the visible side of the moon was also seen on the photos taken in space and sent back to Earth.

In this way, for some objects that could previously only be partially seen on the visible side of the moon, people have, for the first time, been able to see their entire picture.

In the future, scientific circles will have a complete concept of the true shape of objects such as the Mare Australe (Southern Sea), because a large part of the Mare Australe is located on the hemisphere invisible from Earth.

### “莫斯科”“宇宙航行家”“苏维埃”“理想”……  月球背面山“海”定名

    “莫斯科”“宇宙航行家”“苏维埃”“理想”……
    月球背面山“海”定名
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社自苏联科学界获悉消息：苏联科学界已给月球背面的一些山、“海”等对象确定了名称。
    位置在月球背面赤道以北（纬度二十度和三十度之间、西子午线一百四十度和一百六十度之间）、直径约为三百公里的“寰形海”已被命名为“莫斯科海”。这个海南部的海湾已被命名为“宇宙航行家海湾”。
    在月球背面的南半球上，有一座直径为一百多公里的寰形山，被命名为“齐奥尔科夫斯基寰形山”。这座寰形山中有一个中央丘。
    月球赤道以北、几乎在月球的可见面和不可见面的交界处，有两座大寰形山，它们分别被命名为“罗蒙诺索夫寰形山”和“约里奥—居里寰形山”。在这两座寰形山的南面、紧靠近赤道的地方，伸延着一条大山系，它的名字已定为“苏维埃山系”。
    月球背面南半球、靠近月面边上的一个海，已命名为“理想海”。
    这第一批名称是在地球收到从苏联自动行星际站发回的月球背面的照片以后决定的，这些照片是在10月7日拍摄的。科学界指出，命名的仅仅是那些在初步研究照片时有把握确定的对象。
    苏联科学院已成立了月球背面寰形山、山系和其他对象命名委员会。
    据科学家说，在宇宙中拍摄下来的、并且已经发回地球的照片上，还看到了月球可见面的一小部分。
    这样一来，有些以前只能在月球可见面看到其一部分的对象，人们第一次有可能看到它们的全貌了。
    今后，科学界对南海等对象的真正形状，就会有一个完整的概念，因为南海有很大一部分位于地球上看不到的半球上。
