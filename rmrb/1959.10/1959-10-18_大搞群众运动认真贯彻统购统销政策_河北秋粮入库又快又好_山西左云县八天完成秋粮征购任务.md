Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th. Hebei Province, on the basis of a bumper harvest of autumn grain crops, is launching a mass grain sales campaign. The amount of autumn grain entering storage in the province is increasing day by day. The average daily storage amount in late September was about 70 million jin, and the daily storage amount on October 10 rose to more than 190 million jin. Eight counties and cities in the province, including Ci County, Nangong, Yongnian, Yutian, Xinle, Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, and Xingtai, have successively completed their grain sales tasks. The Handan Special District has completed its annual grain procurement task three months earlier than last year. The amount of grain stored in the province this year has increased more than four times compared with the same period last year, and the storage time is one and a half months earlier than last year.

The reasons for the fast pace, early timing, and good quality of this year's autumn grain procurement work in Hebei Province are: adhering to putting politics in command; vigorously launching mass movements. Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the province's farmers for production is high and their energy is soaring. Many moving deeds have emerged in grain sales. The Huowangzhuang Production Team in Ci County organized 486 laborers and 450 stone rollers to rush to thresh 350,000 jin of grain on the threshing ground overnight. The next day, the team members happily sang mountain songs and sent 186,000 jin of grain to the grain station, selling it to the state, and exceeding the sales task in one fell swoop. The members of the Chengguan Commune in Daming County were full of energy and completed the sales task in just one day and one night.

In the grain sales campaign, red flags were planted, pacesetters were established, on-site meetings were held, and visits and comparisons were organized, which greatly accelerated the speed of delivery.

Conscientiously implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale, actively organizing storage on the one hand, and properly arranging the lives of commune members on the other, implementing the method of collecting, threshing, drying, storing, and distributing as they go along, correctly handling the relationship between the state, the commune, and the individual, has also greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to sell grain.

This newspaper, Taiyuan, 17th. Zuo Yun County, Shanxi Province, has victoriously completed the task of procuring 28 million jin of autumn grain for 1959.

The county's autumn grain delivery work started on October 8 and was completed on the 15th, taking only eight days, about 120 days earlier than in 1958. Now, they are advancing victoriously, striving to complete an additional 14 million jin of increased production and purchase in the next few days to support cities and disaster areas.

Zuo Yun County is a well-known low-yield and impoverished county in Shanxi Province. In the past, the average yield per mu was only fifty or sixty jin. In 1952 and 1955, the county not only had no procurement task but also ate more than 40 million jin of state relief grain. In 1953, 1954, and 1957, 5 million jin were delivered each year; in the bumper harvest of 1956, only 11 million jin were delivered; and in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, only 25 million jin were reached, while this year it reached 28 million jin, plus the 14 million jin of increased production and purchase, which is 60% more than the total of the four years 1953, 1954, 1956, and 1957. It is 68% more than in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Calculated on the basis of the county's 130,000 agricultural population, each person sells an average of 300 jin of grain, which is rare in Shanxi Province. Even so, after completing the procurement task and deducting seeds and feed, each person can still have an average of 577 jin of grain left.

　　大搞群众运动认真贯彻统购统销政策
    河北秋粮入库又快又好
    山西左云县八天完成秋粮征购任务
    据新华社天津16日电　河北省在秋季粮食作物丰收的基础上正在掀起了群众性的售粮运动。全省秋粮入库数量与日俱增，9月下旬平均日入库量七千万斤左右，10月10日的日入库量上升到一亿九千多万斤。全省已有磁县、南宫、永年、玉田、新乐、石市、正定、邢台等八个县、市，先后完成了售粮任务；邯郸专区已比去年提前三个月完成了全年粮食征购任务。全省今年入库数量比去年同期提高四倍多，入库时间比去年提前一个半月。
    河北省今年秋征工作进度快、时间早、质量好的原因是：坚持政治挂帅；大搞群众运动。全省农民在党的八届八中全会的号召鼓舞下，生产情绪高涨，干劲冲天，在售粮中出现很多动人事迹。磁县霍王庄生产队组织了四百八十六名劳动力、四百五十个磙子，突击一夜打完场上三十五万斤粮食，第二天队员们喜气盈盈地唱着山歌，把十八万六千斤粮食送到粮站，卖给国家，一举超额完成了交售任务。大名县城关公社社员干劲冲天，只用一天一夜的时间就完成了交售任务。
    在售粮运动中，插红旗、树标兵，召开现场会，组织参观评比，大大加快了交售速度。
    认真贯彻了统购统销政策，一面积极组织入库，一方面妥善安排社员生活，实行随收、随打、随晒、随入库、随分配的办法，正确地处理了国家、公社、个人之间的关系，也大大鼓舞了农民的售粮热情。
    本报太原17日电　山西省左云县1959年度秋粮征购二千八百万斤的任务已经胜利完成。
    这个县的秋粮交售工作，从10月8日开始，至15日完成，只用了八天时间，比1958年提前了一百二十天左右。现在正乘胜猛进，争取在今后几天，再完成增产增购部分一千四百万斤，支援城市和灾区。
    左云县是山西省有名的低产贫困县。过去平均亩产只有五、六十斤。1952年和1955年两年，这个县不仅没有征购任务，还吃了国家救济粮四千多万斤。1953年、1954年、1957年三年，每年交售五百万斤；大丰收的1956年也只交售了一千一百万斤；大跃进的1958年才达到了二千五百万斤，而今年则达到二千八百万斤，加上一千四百万斤的增产增购部分，比1953、1954、1956、1957四年征购的总和多60％。比大跃进的1958年要多68％，按全县一十三万农业人口计算，每人平均售粮三百斤，这在山西省是少有的。就是这样，除去完成征购任务和扣除籽种、饲料以外，每人还可平均有留粮五百七十七斤。
