    The new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement, marked by high output, high quality, and overall leap forward, is advancing with overwhelming momentum on the Tianjin industrial front. Mass technical revolution and technical innovation activities are springing up like mushrooms after a rain, and labor productivity has significantly improved.

    Under the brilliant illumination of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers are in high spirits, production is renewed daily, and rises every ten days. In terms of total industrial output value, August increased by 20.99% compared to July, and increased by 17.21% compared to the same period last year. Entering September, the first ten days increased by 78% compared to the first ten days of August, and the middle ten days increased by 24.25% compared to the first ten days, making it the month with the highest output value in the first and middle ten days since 1958. The total output value for the entire month of September exceeded the plan by 15.25%, and increased by 42.58% compared to August. The output of various major products also continuously broke records: the daily output of steel has risen from about 1,200 tons in August to about 2,000 tons; the daily output level of steel products has jumped from about 1,400 tons in August to about 2,500 tons, both of which have created new records in history. The output of other products such as soda ash, sulfuric acid, metal cutting machine tools, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, and rubber shoes has also increased significantly. While achieving high output, the quality has continued to improve and consumption has been reduced. According to statistics from the metallurgical, light industry, textile, and chemical industry bureaus, among the fifty-eight major products, the quality of thirty-two products continued to improve, and the rest were mostly stable. Taking cotton spinning factories as an example, after implementing high-speed spinning, the quality did not decline but continued to rise. In the first ten days of September, the standard product rate of cotton yarn in seven of the city's eight major cotton spinning factories reached 100%; the rate of first-class superior products reached 87%, which are both unprecedented highest levels. The labor productivity of each industrial bureau increased by an average of 25% in August compared to July; the comparable cost also decreased by 1% to 5% compared to the same period last year.

    The emergence of this new upsurge in Tianjin's increase production and practice economy movement is the result of implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, and greatly boosting revolutionary enthusiasm. Experience has proven that the more thoroughly the central instructions are studied and the more deeply the right-leaning slackening mood is criticized, the better the masses can be mobilized. As early as the beginning of August, in accordance with the central government's call to overcome right-leaning emotions and vigorously increase production and practice economy, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted publicity and mobilization among the city's workers. At the end of August, the city also dispatched more than 1,400 leading cadres at all levels to form inspection teams to carry out mass "five checks" work: checking the implementation of the anti-rightist struggle, checking indicators, checking measures, checking the development of mass movements, and checking enterprise management. Starting with ideological work, a large-scale debate was launched to promote practical work, discovering and solving problems simultaneously. Many leading cadres, through study, discussion, and major inspections, improved their understanding, became more motivated, actively supported the creative behavior of the masses, and worked with the masses to overcome all difficulties in every possible way, holding high the red flag of the General Line, and advancing bravely. The broad masses of workers also absorbed infinite ideological strength from the call of the Party Central Committee, and their revolutionary enthusiasm became even higher. In the face of the powerful mass movement, all right-leaning thoughts that hindered the progress of the movement were like withered weeds being swept away, and production advanced by leaps and bounds. Steel industrial enterprises throughout the city successively convened party member meetings and worker representative meetings to mobilize the masses to discuss plans, find key problems, and propose measures, and output rose day by day. Some cadres in the textile industry criticized the slackening mood, and many problems that were previously considered unsolvable were readily solved. It was originally thought that the annual plan would be 2% short of completion, but now not only is it guaranteed to be completed, but it will also be increased by 2% to 4%.

    The combat style that leading cadres at all levels in the city demonstrated during the steel production battle last year has been greatly developed again after criticizing right-leaning slackening emotions. They have gone deep into the front line of production, leading production in a down-to-earth manner, and have also "explained" the tasks to the workers on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis from top to bottom, so that every worker clearly understands their tasks.

    Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and attacking key production issues such as insufficient equipment, raw materials, and manpower are the distinct characteristics of this upsurge. This technical innovation and technical revolution movement has come with great force and progressed rapidly, quickly forming a wave of enthusiasm in various industries. After mobilizing the masses of workers, many factories saw a surge of innovation proposals, like mushrooms after a rain. In August, the city proposed more than 39,000 innovation proposals, an increase of 1.87 times compared to July; and since September, it has increased greatly again, with more than 34,000 proposals in the first ten days alone. Most of these surging technical innovation proposals revolve around solving the current key production problems, and they are quickly implemented and have significant effects. Many factories treat the innovation proposals of the masses in a hierarchical manner, implementing them as they are proposed, which doubles production efficiency, breaks through weak links one by one, and powerfully promotes the continuous leap forward of production.

    The competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and surpass the advanced is in full swing. From large factories with tens of thousands of people to small factories with dozens of people, there is an atmosphere everywhere where everyone is striving to be upstream and everyone is striving to be advanced. Pair competitions in the same industry, the same type of work, the same process, and the same business; opponent competitions for the same furnace, the same machine, and the same product; and hook-up competitions between upper and lower processes, production workshops and auxiliary workshops, and departments and workshops are varied in form and rich in content, with everyone chasing each other and not giving in. In mid-September, the average shift output of the roving workshop of the No. 4 Cotton Mill was 62 pieces. Entering the last ten days, Team A created a new record of 63.9 pieces. The workers of Team B immediately chased after them with 65.8 pieces. After the workers of Team A learned about this, they made another effort and reached 66 pieces, surpassing Team B again. With the deepening of the competition, advanced units, advanced individuals, and advanced experiences have emerged in large numbers. As of September 15, more than 520 young workers and 25 groups and workshops in the city had already started working on the tasks for 1960 ahead of schedule. Various districts and bureaus have also widely organized on-site meetings, technical experience exchange meetings, as well as visits and demonstrations between factories and between workshops within factories, so that technical innovations and advanced experiences can "bloom in one place and bear fruit everywhere" and "turn the experience of one group into the experience of the whole factory, and turn the experience of one factory into the experience of the entire industry," thereby achieving a large-scale harvest, and the competition is becoming more and more in-depth.

    天津工业战线反右倾鼓干劲成效卓著
    新的生产高潮又广又猛又稳
    高产优质节约齐头并进　主要产品产量连破纪录
    本报讯　天津市工业战线上的高产、优质、节约全面跃进的增产节约运动的新高潮，正以波涛滚滚之势向前推进。群众性的技术革命和技术革新活动，有如雨后春笋，劳动生产率显著提高。
    在党的八届八中全会的光辉照耀下，广大职工意气风发，生产日日翻新，旬旬上升。从工业总产值来看，8月份比7月份增长了20.99％，比去年同期增加17.21％。进入9月份，上旬又比8月上旬增长78％，而中旬又比上旬提高了24.25％，是1958年以来各月上、中旬产值最高的一个月，9月全月的总产值超额15.25％完成了计划，比8月份又增长了42.58％。各种主要产品产量也不断刷新纪录：钢的日产量已由8月份的一千二百吨左右，上升到二千吨左右；钢材的日产水平由8月份的一千四百吨左右跃到二千五百吨左右，都创造了有史以来的新纪录。其他如纯碱、硫酸、金属切削机床、棉纱、棉布、纸张、胶鞋等绝大多数产品产量都有了显著提高。在高产的同时，继续提高了质量，降低了消耗。据冶金、轻工、纺织、化学等四个工业局的统计，在五十八种主要产品中，质量继续提高的有三十二种，其余大部稳定。以棉纺工厂为例，在实行纺纱高速化以后，质量没有下降反而继续上升。9月上旬的棉纱标准品率，全市八大棉纺厂中，有七个厂达到了百分之百；上等一级品率达到了87％，这都是史无前例的最高水平。各个工业局的劳动生产率8月比7月平均提高了25％；可比成本也比去年同期降低1％至5％。
    天津市的增产节约运动出现这个新高潮，是贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，批判右倾保守思想，大鼓革命干劲的结果。经验证明，凡是认真学习了中央指示，对右倾松劲情绪批判的越深透，群众就能发动得越好。中共天津市委早在8月初，就根据中央关于克服右倾情绪、厉行增产节约的号召，向全市职工进行传达动员，8月底，全市又抽调各级领导干部一千四百多人组成检查团，开展群众性的“五查”工作：查反右倾斗争的贯彻情况、查指标、查措施、查群众运动的开展情况、查企业管理，从务虚入手，开展大鸣大放大辩论，以虚带实，边发现问题，边解决问题。许多领导干部，通过学习讨论和大检查，提高了认识，干劲更足了，主动的支持群众的创造行为，和群众一道千方百计的克服一切困难，高举总路线的红旗，勇猛地前进。广大职工也从党中央的号召中，吸取了无穷的思想力量，革命干劲更加高涨。在雷霆万钧的群众运动面前，一切障碍运动前进的右倾思想有如摧枯拉朽，生产突飞猛进。全市钢铁工业企业纷纷召开党员大会、职工代表大会，发动群众讨论计划，找关键，提措施，产量日日上升。纺织工业的一些干部批判了松劲情绪，许多过去认为无法解决的问题，迎刃而解，原来认为全年计划差2％完不成，现在不但保证完成，还要提高2％到4％。
    全市各级领导干部去年在夺钢大战时表现出来的那种战斗作风，在批判右倾松劲情绪以后，又大大发扬起来，他们纷纷深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地领导生产，并且一杆子插到底地向职工按日、按旬、按月的“交底”，使每一工人明确自己的任务。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，猛攻设备、原料、人力不足等生产关键是这个高潮的鲜明特点，这次技术革新和技术革命运动来势很猛，进展迅速，很快在各个行业形成了热潮。许多工厂在发动职工群众以后，革新建议来势凶猛，有如雨后春笋。全市8月份提出的革新建议就有三万九千多件，比7月份增加一点八七倍；而9月以来又大大增加，仅上旬就提出了三万四千多件。在这些风起云涌的技术革新建议中，大部分是围绕着解决当前的生产关键，实现得也快，效果也很显著，许多工厂对待群众的革新建议进行分级处理，边提边实现，使生产效率成倍提高，薄弱环节一一突破，有力地促进了生产的不断跃进。
    比先进，学先进，超先进的竞赛热火朝天，从上万人的大工厂到几十人的小工厂，到处是人人争上游，个个争先进的气氛。同行业，同工种、同工序、同业务的对口赛，同炉、同机台、同产品的对手赛，上下工序、生产车间与辅助车间、科室与车间之间的挂钩赛，形式多种多样，内容丰富多采，你追我赶，互不相让。棉纺四厂细纱车间9月中旬的平均班产量是六十二件，进入下旬，甲班创造了六十三点九件的新纪录，乙班工人立刻追成六十五点八件，而甲班工人知道后，又使一把劲，达到了六十六件，又超过了乙班。随着竞赛的深入，先进单位、先进人物和先进经验大量涌现，到9月15日止，全市已经有五百二十多名青年工人和二十五个小组、车间提前干1960年的活儿了。各区、局还广泛地组织了现场会议、技术经验交流会，以及各厂之间、厂内各车间之间参观访问、观摩表演，使技术革新和先进经验“一处开花、处处结果”“把一个组的经验变为全厂的经验，把一个厂的经验变为全行业的经验”，从而获得大面积丰收，竞赛也越来越深入。
