Editor's Note: As the Chinese people celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, friends from many fraternal countries have written articles to this newspaper to congratulate the Chinese people. We are now publishing excerpts of these articles here and expressing our heartfelt thanks to them.

Glory Belongs to the Chinese People

Dubrovina, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Council, wrote: The People's Republic of China! This is victory. This is the first and most recent goal of the great people's revolutionary struggle. Achieving national independence, establishing national sovereignty, and completely liberating themselves from foreign enslavement have opened a new page in Chinese history—starting socialist construction and paving the way for the ultimate goal—communism.

Ten years… Compared to thousands of years of history, or even the history of the people's lives in the last hundred years, this is such a short period! Yet it powerfully proves what the strength of a people who are liberated, who are the sole masters of their country, is. The scene of China not long ago: a semi-colonial state, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, humiliation, trampled national self-esteem, plundered national wealth, words written at the gates of parks: "Chinese are not allowed to enter"... All of this has been sent to the ancient museum.

Could the heads of the British capitalist groups have imagined a few years ago that China, which they had so shamelessly trampled on not long ago, had set the task of catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major products within fifteen years! Could they have imagined that China would complete this task in an even shorter period of history—ten years? Moreover, the People's Republic of China is currently successfully solving this task.

In May 1958, the Chinese Communist Party put forward: "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." These words express the Party's general line at the current stage. This general line has blossomed and borne fruit.

The Chinese people have concluded their first ten years with great victories in economic, cultural, and political fields. They have accumulated rich experience, cultivated their own national cadres, and changed the face of their land. With the selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Chinese people are building a new life. They are guided by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese people are striving for world peace and security, and making practical contributions to the struggle for democracy and socialism. Before them, truly, "mountains must bow their heads, and rivers must give way."

Glory belongs to you, the Chinese people!

China Stands Tall

Odrich Shvestka, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Editor-in-Chief of "Red Rights," wrote: Everyone who goes to China, as long as he is not blind, a complete negationist, or an enemy, will see at a glance the new China, the major changes that have taken place in China in a very short period, and everything that the Chinese working people have created with their own hands. Therefore, how ridiculous are those who attempt to erase China and the existence of new China from the map of the world, those who have not yet awakened from their deep sleep! It is futile to bury your head in the sand. Great socialist China stands tall!

We have had many opportunities to see the creativity and selflessness of Chinese workers and peasants, their desire to learn, and their heroic actions to overcome the backwardness left over from a long period and build their own new motherland. In Yunnan, we saw farmers building dams using indigenous and foreign methods; in Shanghai, we saw workers using small machines to produce new, large, modern equipment; in Wuhan, we saw members of people's communes and voluntary laborers using manpower to draw water to irrigate drought-threatened rice fields. Only free people, only those who are liberated from capitalist and feudal exploitation and oppression and led by the Communist Party, can have such creativity, selflessness, wisdom, and love for labor.

A Galloping Steed

Pavel Matev, Secretary of the Bulgarian Writers' Association, wrote:

Please allow me to take this opportunity to say a word about a piece of luck I encountered. That is, this spring I saw the dawn of new China. It is difficult to say at once where its most dazzling brilliance lies: is it in the factories, where workers weave textiles that are as colorful and radiant as flower beds; is it in the magnificent steel joint enterprise, where steel flowers bloom, like the rising sun; is it on the dam on the Yellow River near Sanmenxia, which has tamed the turbulent waves; is it in the beautiful, fertile, and carefully cultivated land of Xinhui County in Guangdong Province; is it in the chapters of modern Chinese poetry and prose; is it on the stage of the opera and the screen of the film? It is difficult to answer this question, but if you want to find the source of this brilliance, you can always find it in the people. This is the Chinese people of today, the Chinese people educated by the Chinese Communist Party. They thank the Party for giving them happiness, they are as modest, simple, and diligent as nature, and as strong and courageous as the small rock in the Yellow River that people call "the mainstay in the middle of the river."

New China has the best symbol: a galloping steed. This image can be seen everywhere, whether at the gate, on the fence, on posters, or on the stone walls of new construction projects. This image shows their confidence in the future of the motherland and their grand ideals for the future. Let that radiant galloping horse fly faster and higher, achieving ever-changing goals!

Forever With the Chinese People

Hungarian writer Maishtinrhazi Lajos wrote: My journey in China lasted more than eight thousand kilometers, and fresh and interesting things were everywhere, leaving me with a deep impression. What is particularly touching is the diligence of the Chinese people.

When I talked to every Chinese, they were all very clear that their country is a vast and resource-rich but also very poor country; they all understood that there is still a great distance between today's reality and their ideal vision; they also knew the great significance of China's rapid development for world peace, for promoting world revolution, and for the future of all mankind. They also hope to live more comfortably in the future and work less. It is precisely for this purpose that they are going all out to strive for a brighter future to come sooner. Therefore, no one complains about being busy with work.

I love the Chinese people, and no matter what happens in the world, I will always stand with the Chinese people. I love the Chinese people, not so much because the Chinese people are very kind to me, but more importantly because the Chinese people are doing good things for everyone.

My Heart Has Flown to Tiananmen Square

Park Kyung-joon, Deputy Head of the Korean News Delegation to China, wrote: Now, although I am thousands of miles away from Beijing, my heart, along with the hearts of 600 million Chinese brothers, has flown to Tiananmen Square to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

I still clearly remember that when we met the mother of martyr Huang Jiguang, a martyr of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in Beijing, she said to us: "Korea and China are brothers, we are of one heart. Just as the Korean people respect Chairman Mao, the Chinese people also respect Premier Kim Il-sung." Mother Huang Jiguang's words are the unanimous feelings of all the Chinese people towards the Korean people, and also the unanimous feelings of all the Korean people towards the Chinese people.

Ideals Will Surely Be Realized

Vietnamese journalist Liu Guiqi wrote: During the journey in China, when we saw the drought in the North China Plain, the fields cracked and the soil was as hard as iron, while at the same time the fields in South China were suffering from floods, we felt anxious; we knew how much difficulty this would bring to the Chinese comrades. But at the same time, we were optimistic. I think that 650 million Chinese people will stand up and repel these droughts and floods... Because I have a belief in my mind: "Not to mention encountering this kind of natural disaster, even if more serious disasters come, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong will surely be able to completely overcome it and continue to move forward at a rapid pace on the road to realizing their most lofty ideals and goals."

The lion of the East has awakened, and has broken the chains of oppression and enslavement, and is leaping forward rapidly. It has the support of the Soviet big brother and other fraternal countries; at the same time, it has the sympathy of people from all over the world. In this way, what ideal cannot be realized?

Ten Years Equals Ten Centuries

Romanian "Spark" editor Victor Beletianu wrote:

In the past, China stagnated under feudal rule and later under imperialist rule. However, the recent ten years in Chinese history—ten years in which the free, self-reliant Chinese people have advanced bravely, ten years of great socialist construction—can be completely compared with the past ten centuries. I personally experienced this change during my three trips to China in 1951, 1953, and 1957.

I will never forget the surprise I felt one day during my third trip when I walked towards the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. I saw endless cities and new, bright buildings stretching for kilometers. In just four years, a new area of Shenyang, no, in fact, a new city of hundreds of thousands of people, seemed to emerge from the ground.

### 热情的祝贺  伟大的友谊

    热情的祝贺  伟大的友谊
    编者按：当我国人民庆祝建国十周年的时候，许多兄弟国家的朋友们撰文寄给本报，向我国人民祝贺。现在，我们将这些文章摘要发表在这里，并且对他们表示衷心的感谢。
    光荣属于中国人民
    苏中友好协会理事会副主席杜布罗维娜写道：中华人民共和国！这就是胜利。这就是伟大人民革命斗争的第一个最近的目标。取得了民族独立，建立了国家主权，由外国奴役下彻底获得解放，这就揭开了中国历史崭新的一页——开始社会主义建设，为走向最终的目标——共产主义开辟道路。
    十年……同几千年的历史，甚至同近百年人民生活的历史比较起来，这是多么短暂的时期啊！然而它有力的证明了，什么是解放了、成为国家全权的、唯一的主人的人民的力量。不久以前的中国的情景：半殖民地状况，贫困、文盲、失业、屈辱、被蹂躏的民族自尊心、被掠夺的民族财富，在公园门口写的字：“中国人禁止入内”……这一切已经送到古代博物馆。
    难道英国资本主义集团首脑在几年以前能够设想，就是他们不久以前所无耻蹂躏的中国，已经提出任务：十五年内，在主要产品产量方面赶上和超过英国！他们难道能想到，这项任务中国要在更短的历史期间——十年完成吗？而且，中华人民共和国目前正在顺利地解决这项任务。
    1958年5月，中国共产党提出了：“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”。这几句话表达了党在现阶段的总路线。这个总路线已经开花结果。
    中国人民以经济、文化和政治各方面的伟大胜利结束了自己的头十年。他们积累了丰富的经验，培养了自己民族的干部，改变了自己土地的面貌。中国人民在苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家无私的兄弟般的援助之下，建设着新的生活。他们以伟大的马克思列宁主义的思想为指南。中国人民正在争取世界和平与安全、争取在民主和社会主义的斗争中作出实际的贡献。在他们的面前真是“高山也要低头，河水也要让路”。
    光荣属于你，中国人民！
    中国巍然屹立着
    捷共中央候补委员、“红色权利报”总编辑奥得里赫·什维斯特卡写道：每一个到中国去的人，只要他不是瞎子，十足的否定论者或敌人，他一眼就会看到新的中国，看到在很短的几年内中国所发生的重大变化，以及中国劳动人民所亲手缔造的一切。因而，那些企图从世界的地图上抹掉中国和新中国的存在这个事实的人们，那些至今还未从沉梦中醒来的人们，显得是多么的可笑！把头藏在沙堆中是徒劳无益的，伟大的社会主义的中国巍然屹立着！
    我们有过许多机会看到中国工人、农民的创造性和忘我精神、学习的渴望以及克服长期遗留下来的落后状态和建设自己的新的祖国的英雄行动。在云南，我们看到农民用土法和洋法修建水坝；在上海，我们看到工人利用小型机器生产新的大型的现代化设备；在武汉，我们看到人民公社的社员和义务劳动的人们用人力抽水灌溉受干旱威胁的稻田。只有自由的人们，只有从资本主义和封建的剥削和压迫下解放出来并在共产党领导下的人们，才能有这样的创造性、忘我精神、智慧和对劳动的热爱。
    飞驰中的骏马
    保加利亚作家协会书记巴维尔·玛代夫写道：
    请允许我利用这个机会说一说我遇到的一个幸运。这就是今年春天我看到了新中国的曙光。很难一下子说出它的最耀眼的光辉在哪里：是在工厂吧，那里的工人织出了五彩绚烂的花坛一般的纺织品；是在宏伟的钢铁联合企业吧，那里钢花怒放，像初升的朝阳；是在三门峡附近黄河上的大坝吧，是它驯服了汹涌的狂澜；是在广东省新会县那美妙丰饶、精心耕耘过的土地上吧；是在现代中国诗歌和散文的篇章上吧；是在歌剧的舞台和电影的银幕上吧？很难回答这个问题，但是你要是去寻找这个光辉的泉源，那末总可以在人的身上找到。这就是今天的中国人，是中国共产党教养下的中国人。他们感谢党给了他们幸福，他们像大自然一般谦逊质朴勤劳，而且坚强果敢好似黄河上那块被人们称为“中流砥柱”的小山岩。
    新中国有一个最好的象征：飞驰中的骏马。无论是在大门口、篱笆上、招贴画上或是新建筑工程的石壁上都可以看到这个形象。这个形象表明他们对祖国明天的信心以及未来的远大理想。让那光芒四射的飞马飞得更快、更高，达到日新月异的目标吧！
    永远同中国人民在一起
    匈牙利作家迈什秦尔哈济·拉约什写道：我在中国的旅途长达八千余公里，新鲜有趣的事物到处都是，给我留下了深刻的印象。特别令人感动的是，中国人民的勤劳。
    我同每个中国人交谈时，他们都非常清楚自己的国家是一个地大物博但又非常贫困的国家；他们都懂得，今天的现实和他们理想的远景还有很大的距离；他们也知道中国的迅速发展对世界和平、对推动世界革命和对整个人类未来的伟大意义。他们也希望将来生活得更舒适，劳动时间更少些。也正是为了这一目的，他们才鼓足干劲力争美好的未来早日到来。因此，谁也不因为工作繁忙而埋怨。
    我爱中国人，无论世界上发生什么事情我永远同中国人民站在一起。我热爱中国人，远不是因为中国人对我很好，而更重要的是中国人在为所有的人做好事情。
    我的心飞到了天安门前
    朝鲜访华新闻代表团副团长朴景埈写道：现在我虽然远离北京几千里，但是，我的心却同六亿中国弟兄们的心一道飞到天安门前，共同庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年。
    我还清楚地记得，当我们在北京会见志愿军烈士黄继光烈士的母亲的时候，她对我们说：“朝鲜和中国是兄弟，我们是一条心。正如朝鲜人民尊敬毛主席一样，中国人民也尊敬金日成首相。”黄继光母亲的这句话，是全体中国人民对朝鲜人民的一致的心情，也是全体朝鲜人民对中国人民的一致的心情。
    理想一定能实现
    越南记者刘贵淇写道：在中国旅行的过程中，当我们看到华北平原遭受旱灾，田地龟裂、土硬如铁，而同时华南田野却又遭受洪水灾害的时候，我们感到焦灼；我们知道，这种情况会给中国同志带来多大的困难。但同时，我们却又是乐观的。我想，六亿五千万中国人民将会站起来，击退这些旱灾和洪水……。因为我脑中有一个信念：“不用说遭遇这种天灾，纵然更严重的灾害临头，在共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，也必然完全能够把它克服，并继续以飞快的步伐，在实现自己最崇高的理想和目的的道路上前进”。
    东方的雄狮已经苏醒了，并且已经挣断了压迫、奴役的锁链，正在迅速地向前跃进。它有苏联老大哥和其他兄弟国家的支援；同时，还得到全世界各国人民的同情。这样，又有什么理想不能实现呢？
    十年等于十世纪
    罗马尼亚“火花报”编辑维克多尔·柏勒蒂亚努写道：
    从前，中国在封建统治以及后来的帝国主义统治下停滞不前。然而，在中国历史的最近十年——自由的、自己当家作主的中国人民勇猛直前的十年，伟大的社会主义建设的十年，完全可以和过去的十世纪相比。我在1951年、1953年和1957年三年在中国的三次旅行，亲身体会到了这个变化。
    我永远也不会忘记在我的第三次旅行中有一天我走向沈阳第一机器制造厂时产生的惊异心情。我看到无尽头的城市和一幢幢新的、光亮亮的建筑物一公里、一公里的延伸着。仅仅四年，沈阳的一个新区，不，事实上是一个几十万人的新城市，就像从地下冒出来的一样。
