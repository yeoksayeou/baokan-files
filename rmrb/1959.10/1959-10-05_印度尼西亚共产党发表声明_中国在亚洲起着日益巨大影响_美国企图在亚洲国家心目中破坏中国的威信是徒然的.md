Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 1st: The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on September 29th, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The statement said that the brilliant victory of the Chinese revolution was the most serious defeat suffered by international imperialism since the great October Revolution of 1917. This is clear evidence of the decline of the colonial rule of imperialists over the countries under their control, a great victory for the people of the East over Western colonialism; this is a decisive victory of international significance, changing the balance of power between imperialist and war forces and the forces of socialism, democracy, and peace.

The statement said that the amazing achievements of the People's Republic of China in ten years of socialist construction prove that socialism is superior to capitalism, and once again confirm the universal truth that Marxism-Leninism is the scientific guiding principle for the struggle for independence and freedom, for the struggle for democracy, progress, peace, and socialism. The achievements of the People's Republic of China once again demonstrate the correctness and greatness of the Communist Party as the revolutionary vanguard and leader in the struggle to establish an independent, free, democratic, just, and prosperous society. For the colonial and semi-colonial people fighting for national independence, the Chinese revolution is an inexhaustible source from which to draw valuable experience.

The statement said that, besides the Soviet Union and the United States, the People's Republic of China is the most powerful country in the world. Whether you admit it or not, this is a fact. In overall international politics, especially in Asia, it plays an increasingly decisive influence and role. The historical fact that the Korean people won victory several years ago with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the great contribution of the People's Republic of China in striving for the victory of the Asian-African Conference, prominently demonstrate the increasingly decisive influence and role of the People's Republic of China in international affairs. Now, no Asian or international issue can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. In Asia, the People's Republic of China is a factor for stabilizing the situation and a defender of peace and security in this region of the world.

The statement condemned the conspiracy of the US imperialists to alienate China from Asian and African countries. The statement said that the United States and other imperialists have repeatedly engaged in instigation and slander, attempting to undermine China's prestige, particularly in the eyes of Asian countries, and to sow discord between China and other countries engaged in the struggle for national independence. The statement said that, under any circumstances, the Indonesian people will continue to maintain and strengthen close and friendly relations with the government and people of the People's Republic of China.

The statement said that the People's Republic of China is a socialist country, a country that opposes colonialism and ardently upholds peace, and all historical facts and actions prove that it faithfully adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The statement said that on the occasion of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian Communists and the entire working people of Indonesia extend congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and their leaders, congratulating China on the various achievements it has made in socialist construction and in the struggle to defend peace in Asia, the Pacific region, and the world. China's achievements are also the achievements of progressives in Indonesia and progressive people who love peace all over the world.

The statement concluded by hailing: Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the long-tested and outstanding vanguard of the heroic and great Chinese working people! Long live the People's Republic of China, the main defender of peace and security in Asia! Long live the great friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people! Long live the friendship of the people of all countries in the world!

    印度尼西亚共产党发表声明
    中国在亚洲起着日益巨大影响
    美国企图在亚洲国家心目中破坏中国的威信是徒然的
    据新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在9月29日发表声明，庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年。
    声明说，中国革命的辉煌胜利，是自从1917年伟大十月革命以来国际帝国主义所遭受的最严重的失败。这是帝国主义者对在他们宰割之下的国家的殖民统治的衰败的明证，这是东方人民对西方殖民主义的巨大胜利；这是改变帝国主义和战争势力同社会主义和民主与和平力量之间的力量对比的具有国际意义的决定性胜利。
    声明说，中华人民共和国在十年社会主义建设中取得的惊人成就，证明了社会主义比资本主义优越，并且再一次证实了这样一个普遍真理：马克思列宁主义是争取独立和自由的斗争，争取民主、进步、和平与社会主义的斗争的科学指导原则。中华人民共和国的成就再一次显示了作为争取建立独立、自由、民主、正义和繁荣的社会的革命先锋队和领导者的共产党的正确和伟大。对于为争取民族独立而斗争的殖民地和半殖民地人民来说，中国革命是可供吸取宝贵经验的取之不尽的泉源。
    声明说，除了苏联和美国而外，中华人民共和国是世界上最强大的国家。不管你承认或者不承认，这是一个事实。在总的国际政治中，特别是在亚洲，它起着越来越具有决定性的影响和作用。几年前在中国志愿军的帮助下朝鲜人民赢得胜利的史实，中华人民共和国竭力争取亚非会议胜利方面的伟大的贡献，突出地证明了中华人民共和国在国际事务中日益具有决定性的影响和作用。现在，任何一个亚洲问题或者国际问题，没有中华人民共和国的参加就不能获得解决。在亚洲，中华人民共和国是稳定局势的一个因素，也是世界上这一地区的和平和安全的保卫者。
    声明谴责了美帝国主义者离间中国和亚非国家的阴谋活动。声明说，美国和其他帝国主义者一再进行挑拨和毁谤，试图特别在亚洲国家心目中破坏中国的威信，并在中国和从事民族独立斗争的其他国家之间散布不和。声明说，在任何情况下，印度尼西亚人民将继续保持和加强同中华人民共和国政府和人民的密切和友好的关系。
    声明说，中华人民共和国是一个社会主义国家，是一个反对殖民主义、热烈拥护和平的国家，全部史实和行动都证明它是忠实地奉行和平共处五项原则的。
    声明说，在庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年之际，印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚全体劳动人民，向中国共产党和中国全国人民和他们的领袖们表示祝贺，祝贺中国在社会主义建设和保卫亚洲、太平洋地区和世界和平的斗争中所取得的各种成就。中国的成就，也是印度尼西亚的进步人士和全世界爱好和平的进步人士的成就。
    声明最后欢呼：英勇伟大的中国劳动人民的久经考验的杰出的先锋队中国共产党万岁！亚洲和平和安全的主要保卫者中华人民共和国万岁！印度尼西亚和中国人民之间的伟大友谊万岁！全世界各国人民的友谊万岁！
