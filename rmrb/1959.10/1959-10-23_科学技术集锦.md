    Photoelectric Tracing Remote Control Automatic Cutting Machine

    Shipbuilding is like making clothes, first you have to cut, and then weld the pieces together. But shipbuilding is much more complicated than making clothes.

    Cutting a steel plate requires so many procedures: first, the design drawings must be enlarged to the original size of the ship, however big the ship is, that is how big the enlargement will be. The ship's lofting platform is like a huge drawing board, and the lofting workers spend all day crawling around on the ground lofting; according to the enlarged drawings, sketch the part sketches and templates; then carry out nesting, and copy the templates onto the steel plate, marking the spots. In this way, the marking work is completed, and then cutting, shearing or gas cutting is carried out.

    In order to improve shipbuilding technology and speed, the Shanghai Ship Scientific Research Institute, the Machine Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute, and the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard and other units cooperated to research and trial-produce China's first highly automated photoelectric tracing remote control cutting machine. To cut steel plates with this cutting machine, you only need to put the drawing of the part under the photoelectric head of the operating machine, turn on the button, and the photoelectric head can automatically follow the lines of the drawing. Due to the different light reflections of black and white, the light energy is converted into pulse electrical energy through the phototube, and the cutting machine is controlled remotely, and the steel plate is cut in accordance with a certain magnification ratio, just like the graphics on the drawing. The previous series of complicated work of lofting, making templates, nesting, marking, and punching is no longer needed.

    Automatic Bricklaying Machine Replacing the Work of Dozens of People

    Long Wenzhong, a famous worker inventor from the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory, with the care and support of the Party, and in cooperation with technicians, after eight years of unremitting painstaking research, has developed an automatic joint bricklaying machine.

    This old worker, who was a mud worker at the age of twelve, suffered all kinds of oppression and the pain of manual labor as a construction worker in the old society, began to engage in technical innovation in 1952. At first, he only made some simple single-piece machines in each process to replace manual operation, such as ash spreaders, continuous mixers for mixing mortar, and electric ash spraying machines for plastering walls. Later, he began to study comprehensive bricklaying machines, until 1958, after thirteen failures and improvements, he finally developed a semi-mechanized bricklaying machine. But he was not satisfied with this and continued to improve his research. After more than half a year of effort, he trial-produced the current fully automated joint bricklaying machine.

    The joint bricklaying machine has two dexterous and powerful arms. During operation, it can automatically push the bricks on the brick row rack into the bricklaying machine. The frame moves along the wall, and the ash spreading machine follows closely behind to spread the ash. Each time a layer is spread and a layer is laid, the elevator rises a layer until the laying is completed.

    This bricklaying machine is most suitable for laying large prefabricated blocks for prefabricated houses. It can lay 30,000 bricks a day, which is equivalent to the work of dozens of people.

    Automated Fish Processing Machine

    The teachers and students of Shanghai Fisheries College have developed a "Large Yellow Croaker Automatic Processing Machine," which has mechanized and automated the killing of fish.

    One by one, foot-long large yellow croakers are first sent to a barrel equipped with countless multi-faceted knives that are constantly rolling, and after a few rolls, the scales on the yellow croaker are completely gone. Then, two saw-shaped knives cut off the head and tail exactly, without wasting a bit. Along with the conveyor belt, sections of yellow croaker bodies without heads and tails are pushed under the gutting machine. The flying knives open the belly without deviation, not too deep or too shallow, and a pair of tweezer-shaped tools pull out all the internal organs, leaving only the fresh fish meat. The rushing tap water immediately washes down, cleaning the fish thoroughly.

    Using this machine to kill fish, more than 14,000 large yellow croakers can be killed a day, which can greatly reduce the manual labor of fishermen. According to the same principle, different fish can be designed with various automatic fish processing machines according to their different body curves and internal organization.

      Electric Automatic Postage Stamp Vending Machine

    The eight-fen and four-fen electric automatic postage stamp vending machines made by the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Center Bureau's Tool Repair Shop can truly be regarded as the most excellent ticket vendors. You give it eight-fen or four-fen coins, and it will immediately give you a stamp, refunding one fen if you give it one fen too much, and two fen if you give it two fen too much, never making a mistake. And it's very fast, only one and a half seconds in total. If you forget and put in less than eight fen, it will very "politely" return the money in full and ask you to make up the difference. Only if you deliberately send nine one-fen coins will it think that this is not necessary, but since you sent them, it has to accept them. If you are dishonest and put in counterfeit money, it can clearly distinguish it and politely return the fake. When the stamps are sold out, it will automatically light up "Stamps Sold Out" and ring the bell to tell the staff to add stamps.

    The vending machine is about the size of an ordinary mailbox. It is most afraid of children playing tricks on it. If you put in a piece of iron, it can stop you and ring the bell for help, but if you put in a piece of paper or a non-magnetic piece, it can't do anything about it and has to stop operating.

    科学技术集锦
    光电跟图遥控自动切割机
    造船像做衣服一样，先要剪裁，然后再一块块焊接起来。但造船就比做衣服复杂得多了。
    剪裁一块钢板要经过这么多手续：先将设计图纸按船原样放大，船有多大就放多大。船的放样台就像一张巨大的图纸，放样工们整天在地上爬来爬去放样；根据放大的图样，画出零件草图、样板；然后进行套料，把样板依样画胡芦画到钢板上，冲上眼子。这样，划样工作才告结束，然后进行剪裁、剪切或气割。
    为了提高造船技术和速度，上海船舶科学研究所、机器制造与工艺研究院和上海沪东造船厂等单位协作，研究试制成我国第一台高度自动化的光电跟图遥控切割机。用这种切割机切割钢板，只要将零件的图纸放到操纵机的光电头下，开动电钮，光电头能自动地跟着图纸的线条跑，由于黑白不同的光线反射，通过光电管，光能变成脉冲电能，并且控制在远处的切割机，在钢板上按照一定的放大比例，和图纸的图形一样把钢板剪裁好。过去的放样、制样板、套料、划线、冲眼一系列繁复的工作都不需要了。
    代替几十人工作的自动砌墙机
    上海建筑机械厂著名的工人发明家龙文忠，在党的关怀和支持下，和技术人员合作，经过八年坚持不懈地刻苦钻研，研究制成一台自动联合砌墙机。
    这位十二岁就作泥水工、在旧社会受尽了压迫吃够建筑工人手工劳动痛苦的老工人，1952年开始搞技术革新。最初，只是在一个个工序上搞些简单的单件机械来代替手工操作，如铺灰器、拌灰浆的连续搅拌机，粉墙的电动喷灰机等。以后开始研究综合的砌墙机，直到1958年，前后经过十三次失败和改进，终于研究出一台半机械化的砌墙机。但他并不以此为满足，继续研究提高，经过半年多努力，试制成现在这台完全自动化的联合砌墙机。
    联合砌墙机有两只灵巧而有力的臂膀，工作时，能自动地把排砖架上的砖头推送到砌墙机内，机架就沿着墙壁移动，铺灰机紧跟着铺灰。每铺好一层，砌好一层，升降机就升高一层，直到砌完为止。
    这台砌墙机最适宜为装配式房屋砌制大型预制块，一天砌砖达三万块，抵几十个人工作。
    自动化的鱼类处理机
    上海水产学院师生研究制成一台“大黄鱼自动处理机”，使得杀鱼也机械化自动化了。
    一条条尺把长的大黄鱼，先被送到一个装有无数多面刀、不停地滚动着的圆桶里，打上几个滚，黄鱼身上的鳞，一片不剩了。接着两把锯形的刀不多不少正好把头尾割下，一点也不浪费。随着传送带，一条条没头没尾的黄鱼身段被推到破肚机下面，飞转的刀不偏不倚、不深不浅把肚破开，一把镊形的器具把内脏全部扒出，只剩鲜嫩的鱼肉，沙沙的自来水马上冲下，把鱼洗得干干净净。
    用这种机器杀鱼，一天可杀大黄鱼一万四千多条，可以大大减轻渔民们的手工劳动。根据同样的原理，不同的鱼，可按它不同的鱼体曲线和内部组织，设计出各种自动的鱼类处理机。
      电动自动售邮票机
    上海邮电中心局工具修配厂制成的八分、四分电动自动售邮票机，真可以算是一位最优秀的售票员。你给它八分或四分硬币，它马上给你一张邮票，多一分找一分，多两分找两分从不出错。而且很快，全部只有一秒半钟。如果你忘了，投入的不足八分，它就很“礼貌”地把钱原数送还请你补足。只有你故意送九只一分的，它认为本来这没有必要，但既然送了，它只好收下。如果你不老实而把伪币投入，它能清楚地分辨出，不客气地退给你假的。邮票售完了，它会自动亮出“邮票售完”，并响铃告诉工作人员加邮票。
    售票机和普通邮箱差不多大小。它最怕小朋友和它开玩笑，放了铁片子它还可以阻止你，并响铃求救，但如投入纸片，或非磁性的片子它就毫无办法，只好停止经营了。　（新华社）
