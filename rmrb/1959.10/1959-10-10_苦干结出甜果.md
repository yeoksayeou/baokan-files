Editor's Note

    Hard Work Bears Sweet Fruit
    Under the blazing sun, ponds and weirs dried up, small rivers stopped flowing, and seedlings withered... The worst drought in seventy years threatened the land of Hubei. No, the people of Hubei were not intimidated. In the eighty or ninety days of the great drought, they were full of fighting spirit, fighting harder and harder, draining the water from ponds and weirs, small ditches, and small rivers, and then turned to rivers and lakes, borrowing water from the Yangtze River and large lakes... People said heroically: "What is there to fear from a hundred days without rain!" This was not boasting. The drought demon finally surrendered to the heroic people of Hubei. In a year of severe drought, Hubei Province's crops did not decrease, nor were they merely maintained, but achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton! This is grain and cotton watered with sweat; hard work finally bore sweet fruit.
    Without the strong leadership of the Party and the collective strength of the people's communes, it would have been unimaginable to overcome this drought!
    The decisive victory in Hubei Province's fight against drought also illustrates a truth, that is, in the face of difficulties, one must never be afraid, slacken, or lose heart; on the contrary, the more difficult it is, the more one must muster full energy, and then all difficulties will be defeated by us. Difficulties only bow to those with fighting spirit, while those who bow their heads will always be subjugated by difficulties.

    苦干结出甜果
    烈日当头，塘堰干涸，小河断流，禾苗枯萎……，七十年未遇的大旱，威胁着湖北大地。不，湖北人民没有被吓倒，他们在延续八、九十天的大旱中，斗志昂扬，越战越强，车干了塘堰、小沟、小河的水，转战江河湖泊，向长江、大湖借水……。人们豪迈地说：“百日无雨又何愁！”这并非夸口，旱魔终于向英勇的湖北人民降服了。在大旱年头，湖北省的农作物没有减产，也不是保产，而是获得了粮棉的丰收！这是汗水浇灌出来的粮食和棉花，苦干终于结出了甜果。
    没有党的坚强领导，没有人民公社的集体力量，要想战胜这场干旱，那真会是不可想像的事呵！
    湖北省的抗旱斗争取得决定性的胜利，还说明一个真理，那就是在困难面前绝不能畏难、松劲、泄气；相反地，越困难越要鼓足干劲，那么一切困难就会被我们打倒。困难只会向有斗志的人低头，而低头的人永远要被困难所屈服。
