Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yongho, told Chinese and foreign journalists here today that the struggle to promote the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea is one of the most pressing issues in the cause of defending and consolidating world peace. He called on all fair-minded people around the world to uphold justice and support the Korean people's struggle.

Ambassador Li Yongho met with Chinese and foreign journalists today on the occasion of the letter sent by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to parliaments of various countries on October 27th. This letter to parliaments of various countries is to call on parliaments of all countries to uphold justice, promote the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, and eliminate the source of new war in Korea, in order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Ambassador Li Yongho said at the press conference that because U.S. imperialism occupied South Korea, our country has been in a state of national division since the first day of liberation. The United States military remains in South Korea to this day, and has always wanted to resolve the Korean issue by war. They have shipped large quantities of destructive weapons, such as atomic weapons and missiles, into South Korea. This intensification of the tense situation is seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. He appealed: "The people of the world are against war and demand peace. Regardless of whether countries have diplomatic relations with us or not, the peace-loving people of all countries will not reject our just proposal."

Finally, in answering a question raised by a Chinese reporter, he spoke warmly about the friendship between the people of Korea and China. He said: "For nearly a hundred years, the people of Korea and China have shared weal and woe in the struggle for independence and freedom. They fought side by side to achieve victory in the national liberation struggle, and side by side they repelled U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that, as the Chinese people supported us in the past, they will certainly give us their full support in all aspects in this struggle for the peaceful reunification of our country."

    李永镐大使在京举行中外记者招待会
    呼吁支持朝鲜和平统一斗争
    促使美军撤出南朝鲜是当前保卫和平的迫切任务
    据新华社29日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐今天对这里的中外记者说，促使美军撤出南朝鲜，争取朝鲜和平统一的斗争，是当前保卫和巩固世界和平事业中最迫切的问题之一。他呼吁全世界的公正人士主持正义，支持朝鲜人民的这一斗争。
    李永镐大使今天是为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在10月27日致世界各国议会的信件而会见中外记者的。这封给各国议会的信，是为了呼吁世界各国议会主持正义，促使美军撤出南朝鲜，铲除朝鲜的新战争根源，以实现朝鲜的和平统一而发出的。
    李永镐大使在记者招待会上说，由于美帝国主义侵占了南朝鲜，我们的国家从解放开始的一天起就陷于民族分裂的局面。美国军队至今赖在南朝鲜不走，而且一直想用战争的方法来解决朝鲜问题，他们向南朝鲜运进了原子武器和导弹等大批毁灭性武器，这种紧张局势的加剧，正严重地威胁着远东和世界和平。他呼吁说：“全世界的人民都反对战争，要求和平，世界各国不管同我们有无外交关系，各国爱好和平的人民是不会拒绝我们这个正义的建议的。”
    最后，他在答复中国记者所提出的一个问题时，热情地谈到朝中两国人民的友谊。他说：“朝中两国人民近百年来在争取独立自由的斗争中，曾经同甘苦，共患难，他们并肩取得了民族解放斗争的胜利，又并肩打退了美帝国主义，我们完全相信，过去中国人民支持我们，这次在和平统一祖国的斗争中，一定也会在各方面全力支持我们。”
