The quick realization of agricultural technical transformation in our country, that is, the mechanization, irrigation, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture. In a country like China, with a large population and vast territory, agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. We must combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. Quickly realizing agricultural technical transformation is of paramount importance to accelerating the speed of socialist construction. This requires industry to arm agriculture with powerful modern technology. This is also the glorious task of the Chinese people, especially the working class. – Excerpt from the CPC Central Committee's congratulatory message

    (本报讯) This newspaper reports that in order to quickly realize agricultural technical transformation and support the continued leap forward in agricultural production, the broad masses of workers in the national agricultural machinery industry and chemical industry production departments have this year produced more agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides with unparalleled enthusiasm and soaring drive, arming agriculture.

    As of September this year, among the eleven products produced by the agricultural machinery sector this year, seven products including irrigation and drainage machinery, tractor-drawn plows, cultivators, motorized sprayers, combine harvesters, power threshers, and pasture harvesters have completed their annual planned targets ahead of schedule or exceeded them. Currently, various production departments are striving to comprehensively complete this year's production plan half a month ahead of schedule.

    Since the beginning of this year, the national agricultural machinery industry production has continued to leap forward greatly on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. According to preliminary statistics, from January to early September, the national production of irrigation and drainage power machinery was equivalent to 150% of the total output for the entire last year; motorized sprayers, combine harvesters, etc. increased by about 100% compared to last year; and tractor production also reached 118% of the total output for the entire last year. These machines have played a significant role in supporting this year's agricultural production and drought and flood control.

    Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the broad masses of agricultural machinery industry workers widely launched an increase production and practice economy movement and socialist labor emulation, and production increased significantly month by month. For example, comparing August production with September, the increase in harrows was 260%, plows increased by 184%, seeders increased by 570%, and tractors increased by 200%. Along with the increase in products, the quality has also improved significantly. For example, the scrap rate of castings in Shandong Weifang Diesel Engine Factory has dropped from 10%-20% in the past to 5%.

    At present, agricultural machinery industry workers in various regions are launching a production upsurge for the fourth quarter, striving to enter 1960 ahead of schedule, doing everything possible to improve technology and increase production; vigorously grasping the matching work of tractors, tractor-drawn agricultural implements, and irrigation and drainage machinery, and striving to complete the urgent matching tasks of the existing 25% of tractors and more than 40% of irrigation and drainage machinery. The Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Industry requires all enterprises to vigorously grasp material supply, vigorously grasp cooperation, and vigorously grasp the preparation for the trial production and production of new varieties next year, to ensure the realization of completing and over fulfilling this year's production plan half a month ahead of schedule, and to create favorable conditions for continued leap forward next year.

    The national chemical production system has increased the production of a large number of fertilizers and pesticides this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Chemical Industry, by the end of September, the country had produced more than 886,000 tons of fertilizer, an increase of 24.5% over the same period last year, and more than 91,000 tons of pesticides, an increase of 58% over the same period last year.

    To ensure the increase in fertilizer production, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has taken many effective measures: giving full play to the potential of existing key enterprises, balancing equipment, allocating materials, and overcoming weak links; grasping the four key sulfuric acid capital construction projects (because the key to increasing fertilizer production is sulfuric acid), ensuring that they are put into production before the end of the year; grasping the sulfuric acid production of small and medium-sized factories, and by the end of September, 443 small sulfur-connecting factories with an annual output of 400 tons had been built nationwide; grasping the production of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer and promoting the use of simple native blast furnaces for trial production; grasping maintenance and repair, which is now being actively carried out in various chemical plants to ensure that January next year's production is higher than December this year.

    Due to specific leadership and the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the mass movement in various chemical plants has been unprecedentedly high, and the national fertilizer production has been rising month by month. The daily output in July was 3,575 tons, 3,579 tons in August, and a sharp increase to 4,466 tons in September. This year's pesticide production is also more than last year in quantity, and the varieties have increased and the production is timely. From seed dressing agents used at the time of sowing to fumigants used to protect grain after harvest, they were supplied to the countryside in a timely manner, ensuring that there were fungicides when crop fungi appeared, and insecticides when pests appeared. Eight new pesticide varieties have been added this year. For various technical crops, such as cotton and fruit trees, the required pesticides have also been prepared. In addition to this, rubber factories also produced rubber pipes required for water conservancy irrigation, rubber accessories required for agricultural machinery and rural transportation, and so on.

    At present, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is specifically arranging the work of supporting agricultural production this winter and next spring.

    以强大的现代技术武装农业
    七项农业机械产品提前完成全年计划
    化肥、农药比去年同期增产二至五成
    我们要尽快地实现我国的农业技术改造，就是说使农业实现机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。在我们中国这样一个人口众多、地大物博的国度里，农业是国民经济发展的基础。我们必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。尽快地实现农业技术改造，对于加快社会主义建设的速度有着头等重要的意义。这就要求工业以强大的现代技术武装农业。这也是我国人民特别是工人阶级的光荣的任务。——摘自中共中央祝词
    本报讯　为了尽快地实现农业技术改造，支援农业生产继续跃进，全国农业机械工业和化学工业生产部门的广大职工，今年以无比的热情和冲天的干劲，增产了各种农业机械和化肥、农药，武装农业。
    截至今年9月，农业机械部门今年生产的十一项产品中，已有排灌机械、机引犁、中耕机、机动喷雾机、联合收割机、动力脱粒机和牧草收割机等七项产品，提前或超额完成了今年计划指标。目前，各生产部门正力争提前半月全面完成今年生产计划。
    今年以来，全国农业机械工业生产又在去年大跃进的基础上，继续向前大大地跃进了一步。据初步统计，1至9月上旬，全国生产的排灌动力机械相当于去年全年产量的150％，机动喷雾机、联合收割机等，比去年增长一倍左右，拖拉机生产也达到去年全年产量的118％。这些机械，在支援今年农业生产和抗旱排涝中都起了不小的作用。
    在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，广大农业机械工业职工广泛地开展了增产节约运动和社会主义劳动竞赛，生产月月显著增长。如以8月份生产和9月份相比，耙的增长为260％，犁的增长为184％，播种机增长为570％，拖拉机增长为200％。与产品增长的同时，质量也有显著提高。如山东潍坊柴油机厂的铸件废品率已由过去的10％—20％降到5％。
    目前，各地农业机械工业职工正在掀起大战第四季度、力争提前跨进1960年的生产热潮，千方百计地改进技术，提高生产；大抓拖拉机、机引农具和排灌机械的配套工作，努力完成现有25％的拖拉机和40％以上的排灌机械的急切配套任务。农业机械工业部要求各企业大抓材料供应，大抓协作，大抓明年新品种试制和生产的准备工作，保证实现提前半月完成和超额完成今年的生产计划，并为明年继续跃进创造有利条件。
    全国化工生产系统今年增产了大量化肥、农药，据化工部统计，到9月底，全国已生产化肥八十八万六千多吨，比去年同期增长24.5％，农药九万一千多吨，比去年同期增长58％。
    为保证化肥增产，化工部采取了许多有力措施：发挥现有重点企业的潜力，平衡设备，调拨材料，克服薄弱环节；抓四个重点硫酸基本建设工程（因为增产化肥的关键是硫酸），保证年前都投入生产；抓中小型厂硫酸生产，全国到9月底已建成年产四百吨的小接硫厂四百四十三个；抓钙镁磷肥的生产，推广利用设备简单的土高炉试验生产；抓维护检修，现在各化工厂正积极进行，以保证明年1月份生产高于今年12月。
    由于领导具体和贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针，各化工厂经过反右倾、鼓干劲，群众运动空前高涨，全国化肥产量月月上升。日产7月份为三千五百七十五吨，8月份三千五百七十九吨，9月份猛增到四千四百六十六吨。今年的农药生产也比去年数量多，而且品种增加，生产及时。从播种时用的拌种剂到收获后保护粮食用的熏蒸剂，都及时供应了农村，做到了农作物有菌出现，即有杀菌剂，有害虫出现即有杀虫剂。今年新增加的农药品种有八种。对于各种技术作物，如棉花、果树等，也都准备了所需的农药。除此而外，橡胶厂还生产了水利灌溉所需的橡胶管道、农业机械和农村运输所需要的橡胶配件，等等。
    目前，化工部正在具体安排今冬明春支援农业生产的工作。
