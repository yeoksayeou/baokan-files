The sun at eight or nine in the morning
Liu Di

Red October is a month of joyous occasions. We have just joyfully celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, and now another joyous event is upon us: On the 26th, the National Congress of Heroes from the industrial, transportation, and other fronts opened in Beijing. From the magnificent ranks of heroes, from the vivid and moving model deeds, we have seen a thriving scene across the country and heard the resounding footsteps of the 600 million people marching forward in the Great Leap Forward. In our country, there is vitality and strength everywhere. New things are growing rapidly with strong vitality, like surging tides and the rising sun in the East.

In this heroic team, there are many veterans who have fought for a long time and made outstanding achievements, but even more are the emerging new forces. On all fronts of socialist construction, new armies are emerging, and this new scene is thought-provoking. I was reminded of a passage by Chairman Mao to Chinese students in the Soviet Union: "The world is yours, and it is ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and are in a period of prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." Repeatedly reciting the teachings of our great leader, I deeply feel that our generation of young people is the happiest. The Party places its hope on the youth, and the youth listen to the Party the most. A bright and splendid new world will surely belong to us. Look at the youth of our country! Only ten years after the founding of the country, a new generation has grown up vigorously like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Under the nurturing of the Party, they have made tremendous contributions to the prosperity and strength of our motherland. The new generation is creating new achievements, how can we not be proud of these young masters of our country?

Look! Recently, young workers in various places have actively responded to the Party's call, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching a new upsurge of production to "enter 1960 at high speed." As soon as the movement started, it was magnificent and raging like a prairie fire. In less than a month, thousands of young people in various provinces and cities have completed this year's workload ahead of schedule and leaped into 1960. Some young people are running faster and further, they have already entered 1961, 1962... and even 197x. In the casting workshop of the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory, there is a youth leap forward team. In order to over fulfill the plan, they carried out technical revolution and changed manual operation, winning 271,000 work hours with 271 innovations, and completed 15 years and four months of workload. All the workers in the group entered 1974 together. Such deeds are emerging one after another. The young people hold high the red flag of the general line and stride forward, taking bigger and faster steps. From their leaping strides, from their firm revolutionary will, we feel the vitality of youth, the warmth of enthusiasm and the dazzling fire. Seeing these, isn't it like seeing the future of our country, like seeing the sun at eight or nine in the morning?

New forces are unstoppable. The sun is about to rise, and the water of the Pacific Ocean cannot submerge it. The waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves ahead, and a new generation surpasses the old. Veterans teach novices, and novices surpass veterans. The advanced become more advanced, and the backward must catch up with the advanced. Not to advance is to retreat. This is the law of the development of things. In our country, heroes emerge in large numbers, and new things grow like hundreds of flowers blooming everywhere, colorful and vibrant. This is an inevitable phenomenon, and there is no need to be surprised. Fertile soil, shining sunshine, good climate, sufficient water and fertilizer, all these nurture the growth of new things, and all these come from our country's superior social system and the wise leadership of our Party. Our younger generation, with the Party's motherly care and cultivation, and with the leadership of experienced advanced fathers and brothers, will bravely move forward in the correct direction pointed out by the Party, and will surely accomplish great things that no one has done before. Isn't it a truth that blue comes from indigo and surpasses it, and the later generation surpasses the earlier one, which has been constantly proven since ancient times?

The sun at eight or nine in the morning will gradually rise to the sun at twelve o'clock, and the younger generation will grow up, and the strong seedlings will blossom and bear fruit. In the same way, all new things in the world are invincible. This is the truth of Marxism, and it is the inevitable law of historical development. This is exactly the case. A hundred years ago, Marx declared to the world that communism would defeat capitalism. Today, the ideological radiance of communism shines on the earth like the sun. Although our socialist system has only a few decades of history, it has already replaced the decadent capitalist system in the regions of half of the world's population, and it will surely achieve victory throughout the world. Our great country has been born in the world for ten years, isn't this also a great witness to the inevitable victory of new things? When we had just stood up from our own land, the imperialists predicted that we would fall. However, for ten years, we have not only not fallen, but have become stronger and more powerful, and will become even stronger in the future. For ten years, the imperialists have not spent a single day without cursing us, plotting against us, and trying every means to bring us down, but they have ultimately failed. Haven't some right-leaning opportunists in our country also been afraid of and opposed the growth of new things? But they have also failed. The people's communes have not been overthrown by their scolding, but have become stronger; the Great Leap Forward has not been retreated by their scolding, but has leaped forward even more; the red flag of the general line has not been shaken, but has been raised higher and higher.

Always remember one point: all those in the world who do not recognize new things will fail, and this is the inevitable result that cannot be changed in any way. Because "in history, the later comers always surpass the former, and the seemingly weak, representing progress, and new things always defeat those that seem powerful on the surface, representing conservatism, and tending to death." (Liu Shaoqi: Work Report of the CPC Central Committee to the Eighth National Congress, Second Session).

The rising sun is rising, and as the sun rises to the zenith, the sunlight will be more brilliant. The future is not very pleasant for all those who are afraid of the sun.

    早晨八、九点钟的太阳
    柳笛
    红十月，是个喜事临门的月份。我们刚刚欢欣鼓舞地度过了建国十周年这个喜庆的日子，又一件喜事临门了；二十六日，全国工业、交通运输等战线上的群英会在北京开幕。我们从浩浩荡荡的英雄队伍中，从生动感人的模范事迹里，看到了全国一片欣欣向荣的景象，听到了六亿人民大跃进的雄壮的脚步声。在我们国家里，真是到处充满了生机、充满了力量，新生事物以强大的生命力迅速成长起来，如海涛汹涌，如东方旭日。
    在这支英雄的队伍中，有许多久经战斗，屡建奇功的老将，但更多的是不断涌现出来的新生力军。建设社会主义的各条战线上，到处新军突起，这番新的景象是颇引人深思的。我想起了毛主席对我国留苏学生说的一段话：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”反复吟咏着我们伟大领袖的教诲，深深感到我们这一代青年人是最幸福的。党把希望寄托在青年的身上，青年也最听党的话，一个光辉灿烂的新世界一定是属于我们的。看看我国的青年吧！建国才十年，一代新人就像雨后春笋一样茁壮地成长起来了。他们在党的哺育下为我们的祖国的繁荣富强贡献了巨大的力量。新的一代创造着新的成绩，我们怎能不为我国这些年轻的主人们感到骄傲呢？
    看吧！最近以来，各地青年工人积极响应党的号召，反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起了“高速度跨进1960年”的新的生产高潮。运动一起，就气势磅礴，如火如荼，不到一个月的时间，各省市都有成千上万的青年提前完成今年的工作量，飞跃进入1960年，有些青年跑得更快更远，他们已经进入1961年、1962年……，甚至197×年了。南昌柴油机厂铸工车间有个青年跃进小组，他们为了超额完成计划，大搞技术革命，改变手工操作，以二百七十一项革新赢得二十七万一千多个工时，完成了十五年四个月的工作量，全组工人一起跨进了1974年。这样的事迹层出不穷。青年们高举总路线的红旗，昂首阔步前进，步子愈迈愈大，愈来愈快。我们从他们跃进的步伐里，从他们坚定的革命意志里，感到了青春的活力，感到了暖人的热气和耀眼的火光。看到了这些，不正是像看见了我们国家的未来，像看见了早晨八、九点钟的太阳一样吗？
    新生力量势不可挡。太阳要升起来，太平洋的水是淹没不了它的。长江后浪推前浪，一代新人胜旧人，老将教新手，新手胜老将，先进的更先进，落后的要赶过先进，不进则退，这是事物发展的规律。在我们的国家里，英雄辈出，新生事物像百花一样遍地丛生，万紫千红，这更是必然的现象，一点也用不着大惊小怪。肥沃的土壤，普照的阳光，大好的气候，充足的水分和肥料，这一切都润育着新事物的成长，这一切都来自我国优越的社会制度和我们党的英明领导。我们青年一代有了党像母亲般的关怀和培育，有了久经锻炼的先进父兄们的带领，按照党指出的正确方向勇猛前进，必然会做出一番前人所没有做出的伟大事业。青出于蓝，后来居上，难道不是自古以来就不断证明了的真理吗？
    早晨八、九点钟的太阳会逐渐上升为十二点钟的太阳，青年一代要成长起来，茁壮的幼芽会开花结果。和这个道理一样，世界上一切新生的事物都是不可战胜的。这是马克思主义的真理，是历史发展的必然规律。事情正是如此。一百年前马克思就向世界宣布：共产主义要战胜资本主义，如今，共产主义的思想光芒就像太阳一样普照着大地；我们的社会主义制度虽然才有几十年的历史，可是已经在世界的一半人口的地区代替了腐朽的资本主义制度，而且也一定会在全世界取得胜利。我们伟大的国家在世界上诞生已经十年了，这不也是新生事物必然胜利的一大见证吗？当着我们刚刚从自己的土地上站立起来的时候，帝国主义者就预言我们要倒下去，可是，十年了，我们不仅没有倒下去，反而更加健壮有力了，而且今后还会更加强大起来。十年以来，帝国主义者没有一天不在咒骂我们，暗算我们，千方百计地要把我们搞垮，可是他们终久是失败了。我们国内的一些右倾机会主义分子不是也在害怕和反对新生事物的成长吗？但是他们也失败了。人民公社没有被他们骂垮，反而更加壮大了；大跃进没有被他们骂退，反而更加跃进了；总路线的红旗没有动摇，反而愈举愈高了。
    永远记住一点：世界上凡是不承认新生事物的人都要失败，这是无论如何也改变不了的结果。因为“在历史上，永远是后来者居上，永远是暂时显得弱小的、代表进步方面的、新生的事物战胜那些表面上似乎强大的、代表保守方面的、趋向死亡的事物。”（刘少奇：中共中央向八大二次会议的工作报告）。
    旭日正在升起来，日升中天，阳光会更加灿烂。一切害怕阳光的人，前途是很不美妙的。
