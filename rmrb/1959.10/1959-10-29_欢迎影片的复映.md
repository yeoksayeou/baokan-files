Title: Encore Screenings of Welcomed Films

Column: From the Readers

    Recently, cinemas in Beijing and other places have been screening many excellent Chinese and foreign films that were shown in the past decade. The audience welcomes this very much.
    In the past, the screening time of a new film was relatively short. Within a few days, it would "disappear" in a city, and might never be shown again. In this way, many viewers inevitably lose the opportunity to appreciate it. I suggest that cinemas make appropriate arrangements for new and old films, Chinese and foreign films, and even "popular" and "unpopular" films: conduct encore screenings in a planned and purposeful manner.

    欢迎影片的复映
    北京等地影院最近上映了近十年来曾经映出过的许多部中外优秀影片。观众们都很欢迎。
    过去一部新片上映的时间较为短促，几天之内，便在一个城市中“消失”，甚至永不再现。这样就不免要有不少观众失掉欣赏的机会。我建议影院对新的与旧的；中国的与外国的；甚至“热门的”与“冷门的”影片都要适当安排：有计划、有目的地进行复映。
