Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 11th. (Reporters Hu Mingjun and Lin Pinglan) "Full of Enthusiasm, Universal Victory in the Province," this is the excellent situation currently appearing on the Sichuan industrial front.

The entire province's steel, coal, electricity, light industry, chemical industry, transportation, capital construction and other fronts, under the great call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have seen a moving situation of rising production and sustained high yields since August and September. The production of many industries in September did not increase by a few percent or a dozen percent, but by tens of percent, creating the highest monthly output record this year. Compared with August, the province's steel production in September increased by 62.77%, iron production increased by 43.6%, and coal and coke production increased by 22.59% and 33.6% respectively. The output of steel, iron, and coal in September was higher every ten days; the highest daily output of iron has broken through the 8,000-ton mark, and the daily output of coal has reached 125,600 tons, both setting the highest daily output records this year. The total output value of the province's machinery industry in September increased by 53% compared with the average monthly output level from January to August this year, becoming the highest month this year. Employees on the province's transportation front also created the highest monthly output record this year in September. Compared with August, the volume of iron, grain, and commodity materials transported increased by 26.68% to 34%.

As a result of the province's employees' major battle in August and September, many departments and enterprises have shown a new atmosphere of comprehensive leaps forward in all aspects such as output, quality, cost, and safety. Units and individuals that have completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule are also emerging continuously. After the major battle in August and September, the province's machinery industry had more than 60 major machinery factories that comprehensively completed the five major indicators for the third quarter, including total output value, commercial output value, cost, labor productivity, and major product output. By the end of September, the Wenjiang and Daxian special districts in the province had completed this year's raw coal production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Jiangjin, Leshan, Neijiang, Nanchong, Wenjiang and other five special districts and Chengdu City have all completed the annual coke production plan ahead of schedule. In Chongqing City, the employees of the machinery system alone had more than 4,000 workers who completed their annual tasks and entered 1960.

The excellent situation of "full of enthusiasm and universal victory" on the province's industrial front is the result of the vigorous struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking launched by employees on all fronts under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. After the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, the work style of leading cadres at all levels on the industrial front has undergone great changes. They have gone to the steelmaking furnaces, down the mines, to the mines, and to the forefront of production, adhering to working with the masses and leading production in production. The leading cadres of many units have grasped production every day, every moment, and every shift, which has greatly promoted production and encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. Leading cadres at all levels of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company took shovels in one hand and mobilized the masses in the other, persevering day and night in front of the steelmaking furnace, working with the workers to study and solve key production problems, and leading the workers to break through the weak links in production. Many problems were easily solved. Therefore, since September, the entire company has repeatedly created new daily output records that have never been seen in the company's history.

Since August and September, the province's industrial workers have been high-spirited and ambitious, putting forward a large number of technical innovation proposals and creating a large number of new production records around the key to production. In Chongqing alone, employees created more than 30,000 new production records in September alone, and realized more than 190,000 technical innovation proposals. This very high creative labor of the broad masses of employees has made the production upsurge higher than the last, and since August and September, a new production situation has emerged that is higher month by month and higher every ten days.

"Strive for every second, strive for every ounce, resolutely exceed the target, and never be in debt," is the common combat slogan of the province's four million employees. After achieving a comprehensive victory in September, as soon as they entered October, they pushed production to a higher production level. Compared with the average daily output level from the 1st to the 8th with the daily output level in September, steel increased by 9.89%, steel products increased by 36.36%, and pig iron increased by 16.75%; compared with the same period in September, raw coal increased by 14.2% and coke increased by 45.6% in the first week of October.

The recently held province-wide industrial and transportation front broadcast mobilization meeting to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the annual plan sounded the bugle call for a final battle in the fourth quarter more loudly throughout the province. Employees on all fronts have now put forward new goals and various specific measures to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the fourth quarter and the annual plan. Employees in the province's steel industry have proposed to resolutely guarantee that the average daily steel production level will be consolidated above 4,000 tons; coal mine employees have proposed to resolutely consolidate the daily output of raw coal at the level of 110,000 tons; employees in the transportation department have also proposed to fight the final battle in the fourth quarter and complete the transportation tasks stipulated by the state 10 days to half a month ahead of schedule.

At present, employees throughout the province are racing against time, aiming at the requirements of high yield, high quality, low cost, and safe production, and are carrying out more extensive and enthusiastic competitions between shifts, groups, furnaces, wells, machine tools, vehicles, ships, and individuals, striving for each unit, each equipment, and each individual to complete the plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

　　跃进形势无限好　生产热潮月月高
    四川工业战线全面告捷
    新华社重庆11日电　记者胡明俊、林平兰报道：“干劲十足，全省皆捷”，这是当前四川工业战线上出现的大好形势。
    全省钢铁、煤、电、轻工业、化学工业、交通运输、基本建设等各个战线，在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，8、9月份以来出现了生产节节上升和持续高产的动人局面。许多行业9月份的生产不是提高百分之几或十几，而是百分之几十，创造了今年以来最高月产纪录。9月份同8月份比较，全省钢的产量就猛增了62.77％，铁的产量增长了43.6％，煤和焦的产量分别提高了22.59％和33.6％。9月份钢、铁、煤的产量，都一旬比一旬高；铁的最高日产量已经突破八千吨大关，煤的日产量达到了十二万五千六百吨，都创造了今年的最高日产纪录。9月份全省机械工业的总产值，比今年1月到8月份的平均月产水平提高了53％，成为今年最高的一月。全省交通战线职工9月份也创造了今年以来最高的月产纪录，同8月份比较，生铁、粮食、商品物资的调运量，增长了26.68％到34％。
    全省职工大战8、9月份的结果，许多部门和企业单位出现了产量、质量、成本、安全等各方面全面跃进的新气象，提前完成今年全年国家计划的单位和个人也不断涌现。全省机械工业经过大战8、9月，有六十多个主要机械厂全面完成了第三季度的总产值、商业产值、成本、劳动生产率和主要产品产量等五大指标。到9月底，全省已有温江、达县专区提前超额完成了今年原煤生产计划。江津、乐山、内江、南充、温江等五个专区和成都市，都提前完成了全年的焦炭生产计划。在重庆市，仅机械系统职工，就有四千多工人完成了全年任务，跨进了1960年。
    全省工业战线出现的这种干劲十足、全线皆捷的大好形势，是在中共四川省委的领导下，各个战线职工展开轰轰烈烈的反右倾保守思想斗争的结果。经过反右倾保守思想的斗争，各工业战线各级领导干部的作风有了很大的转变，他们纷纷到炼钢炉边、到井下、到矿山，到生产的最前线去，坚持同群众一道劳动，在生产中领导生产。许多单位的领导干部对生产作到了天天抓、时时抓、班班抓，这就大大推动了生产，鼓舞了群众的生产热情。重庆钢铁公司各级领导干部一手拿铁锹，一手发动群众，日夜坚持在炼钢炉前，同工人一起研究解决生产上的关键问题，领导工人突破生产上的薄弱环节，许多问题迎刃而解。因此，全公司9月份以来，接连数次创造了公司历年来所未有的日产量新纪录。
    8、9月份以来，全省工业战线职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，围绕生产关键提出了大批的技术革新建议和创造了大批的生产新纪录。只是重庆一地职工，在9月份一个月就创造了三万多次生产新纪录，并且实现了十九万多件技术革新建议。广大职工群众的这种十分高涨的创造性的劳动，使生产热潮一浪比一浪高，8、9月份以来出现一月比一月高、一旬比一旬高的生产新局面。
    “分秒必争，斤两必争，坚决超额，决不欠账”，这是全省四百万职工共同的战斗口号。他们在9月份取得全线大捷之后，一进入10月就把生产推向了一个更高的生产水平。1日到8日的平均日产水平同9月份日产水平比较，钢增长9.89％，钢材增长36.36％，生铁增长16.75％；10月份第一周同9月份同期比较，全省原煤增长14.2％，焦炭增长45.6％。
    最近召开的全省工业交通战线保证提前超额完成全年计划的广播动员大会，在全省范围内更加响亮地吹起了决战第四季度的号角。各个战线上的职工，现在又提出了新的奋斗目标和各种具体措施，保证提前超额完成第四季度和全年的计划。全省钢铁职工提出，要坚决保证把炼钢的平均日产水平巩固在四千吨以上；煤矿职工提出，要坚决把原煤日产量巩固在十一万吨的水平上；运输部门的职工也提出，要决战第四季度，提前十天到半个月全面完成国家规定的运输任务。
    目前，全省职工正在围绕着高产、高质、低成本和安全生产的要求，争分夺秒，更加广泛、更加热烈地开展了班与班、组与组、炉与炉、井与井、机床与机床、车与车、船与船之间的，以及个人与个人之间的对手竞赛，争取各个单位、各项设备、各个人都能提前超额完成计划。
