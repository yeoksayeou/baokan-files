    Heroic Train
    The Story of the March 8th Youth Red Banner Car Crew of the Shenyang Train Section Overcoming the Flood
    The March 8th Youth Red Banner Car Crew was formed in the summer of 1958 and is responsible for the train service of the special express passenger train between Shenyang and Beijing. The team has a total of forty-seven employees. Except for the train police inspector and a baggage handler who are male comrades, the rest are female comrades, with an average age of about twenty. The car crew has a Party and Youth League branch. Under the leadership of the Party, and because all members of the team warmly and thoughtfully serve the passengers, they have basically achieved the service requirement of treating guests like friends. Therefore, before the March 8th Women's Day this year, they were awarded the glorious title of March 8th Youth Car Crew.
        Fighting the Flood
    On the night of July 21, the train set off from Shenyang Station in heavy rain, heading for the capital of the motherland, Beijing. The rain grew heavier and heavier. As the train entered Xingcheng Station, it received a notice: Due to continuous rain erosion, the roadbed was softened. The train slowly moved to the Shihe River Bridge between Qianwei and Gaoling. A track maintenance foreman told the driver that the roadbed ahead had been turned into slurry by the rain and some parts had been hollowed out, making it impossible to proceed! The train stopped on the bridge. At this time, Deputy Train Chief Li Guiqin woke up the off-duty train Party branch secretary, police officer Li Riku, and reported the situation of the train stopping on the bridge. Comrade Li Riku got out of the car and saw that the river water under the bridge continued to surge, and the lives and property of the six hundred passengers on the train were seriously threatened. So he and the conductor decided, and with the consent of the dispatcher, to reverse the train back to Qianwei Station. Only sixteen minutes later, the Shihe River Bridge was destroyed by the flood. When all the passengers on the train learned of this news, they were all thankful that they had escaped danger. Many passengers excitedly said: If we had been a quarter of an hour slower, we would have gone with the flood.
    Not long after the train returned to Qianwei Station, a militiaman was suddenly seen running and shouting: The reservoir has burst…! Immediately afterward, a white flood was seen rushing towards the train from the northwest. In the face of this flood, the passengers were all shouting: "Start the train! Start the train quickly!" The train quickly retreated backward. At this time, residents on both sides of the line, supporting the old and carrying large and small packages, ran to the train one after another, shouting for help. Could they just stand by and watch them die? Comrade Li Riku shouted: "Stop the train to rescue people!" The driver immediately braked the train. He also notified the crew and passengers through the broadcasting system to quickly open the car windows and doors to rescue people. Although the flood was already impacting the train at this time, people's first thought was not of themselves, but of their suffering compatriots under the train. Communist Party member and train baggage handler Liang Guozhi and many crew members and passengers jumped out of the train to rescue the victims. The flood had submerged the roadbed, rails, and wheels, and a huge flood peak was approaching. In order to ensure the safety of passengers' lives and property, the train had to continue to retreat, but there were still many victims waving to the train for help, so the train stopped again to rescue the victims. The driver accurately controlled the train, retreating and stopping like this, stopping three times and rescuing more than three hundred and fifty fellow countrymen who had been affected by the disaster. When the train entered the Gaopo Changhe Bridge, they found an old lady sitting on the roof, spinning in the whirlpool of the flood. Train attendant Ma Yulin and passenger Zhao Fuxiang, an officer of the People's Liberation Army, jumped into the flood one after another and rescued the old lady from the deep water. At this time, a beam of the house floated over from a distance, with an old man sitting on it. Little Ma didn't have time to rest, and jumped into the water again and swam straight to the old man. When he swam halfway and approached the rapids, he was about to be blocked by the waves, and his life was in serious danger, so people on the shore pulled him back. When Little Ma came up, he saw that the old man was about to be swept away by the rapids, waving his hands wildly, in extreme danger. Although Little Ma's ears were buzzing, his head was swollen and painful, and his whole body was exhausted, but when he thought of the heroic deeds of Xiang Xiuli and An Yemin, a burst of courage surged from his heart, and he felt full of strength. He jumped into the water for the third time, but the old man had already been swept into the rapids by the waves. Comrade Li Riku, train attendant Chen Baozhi, and the passengers standing at the head of the bridge threw a large number of ropes into the rapids. The old man grabbed the rope, and the people on the shore pulled together with force, finally rescuing the old man. In this way, the crew and passengers together rescued nine more victims who were about to be drowned.
      Organize and Fight On
    After such a battle of life and death, although the flood peak had passed, the threat had not been eliminated. Whether the train could start earlier, advance or retreat, became the most concerning thing for the passengers. Based on this situation, the branch secretary convened an emergency meeting and made estimates of both good and bad situations. The meeting made three resolutions: First, Communist Party members must be resourceful, brave, and unafraid of any difficulties, and lead the masses to fight the flood; second, rely on all passengers to organizedly take shelter on both sides of the railway; and third, actively contact the higher authorities to obtain instructions. Then, Train Chief Zhang Minhuan and police officer went to each carriage to mobilize passengers to elect representatives to assist in maintaining order in the carriage and ensuring passenger safety. Soon, a representative group of forty passengers was formed to assist the crew in their work on and off the train, ensuring that the train was in good order.
    Whether the flood would continue to rise, and when the line would be repaired, were unknown. What about the passengers' meals? ...There were a lot of questions. How urgently they needed instructions from their leaders! Train Chief Zhang Minhuan and baggage handler Liang Guozhi connected the mobile telephone to the temporary telephone equipment next to the railway, but despite shouting until their voices were hoarse, they were unable to get a response, proving that communication had been interrupted. All possible attempts had failed. Unable to contact the higher authorities, the train branch had to bravely take on all responsibilities. At this time, the crew and passengers had not eaten for a day and a night; however, the crew members took out the bread and sausages they had brought from Shenyang and gave them to Soviet experts and children. When the passengers saw this, they opened their packages one after another and took out biscuits, snacks, eggs, etc. In a short while, the food sent from each carriage was piled up. How sublime the friendship contained in these foods!
    However, the problem of eating was still a serious problem at the moment. The Party branch decided that branch secretary Li Riku should lead the crew and some passengers out to find food. They ran to Suijialing, three miles away from the train, to contact the Party Committee of the People's Commune. The commune Party committee immediately allocated eighteen bags of white flour; but they needed to carry it from a place five miles away. More than fifty passengers and crew members volunteered for this task. After the flour was carried back, a cooking team was immediately formed. But where did the cooking utensils come from? The 12th train did not have a dining car, so the crew ran back to the Suijialing People's Commune to borrow ten large pots. Some commune members took out their only bundles of firewood, and the crew and passengers jointly formed ten pancake-making groups. After more than half a day of labor, fragrant pancakes were cooked. The crew members, fearing that there would not be enough to eat, let the passengers eat first. One passenger put a large pancake in Li Riku's hand, but Li Riku declined, saying he was not hungry, and sent the pancake back. After pushing back and forth, Li Riku finally had to tear off a small piece of pancake and eat it.
          Party's Concern
    On the morning of July 23, the sky was still misty, the train still could not move, and they had not been able to contact the leaders. Six hundred passengers needed to eat and drink water, and many patients were waiting for treatment. However, besides a few white flour pancakes left over from yesterday and an empty first-aid kit, there was nothing else on the train. At this time, a sudden motor sound came from far and near. "Airplane!" People shouted in unison and ran to the outside of the car. A silver-white plane circled over the train. People waved towels and hats, unable to restrain the excitement in their hearts, and raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" Amidst the cheers of the people, the plane dropped many parachutes, landing on the ground. Ah! There were forty large packages of biscuits, with the words "High-grade biscuits to comfort passengers" written on them. The passengers collected the biscuits together, and no one was willing to eat them. In the end, the crew had to distribute them to the passengers. Eating these sweet biscuits, many passengers were moved to tears.
    The Party's concern came from all directions. The Party Committee of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, after discovering that the 12th train was missing, sent a team of seven people, carrying a thousand baked wheaten cakes, braving the wind and rain, and walking along the railway line for a night and a morning to find the train. They were tired and hungry, but they did not eat any of the wheaten cakes they brought to the passengers. After learning the news, the Jinzhou Railway Administration and the district committee immediately sent doctors from Shanhaiguan to set up a temporary clinic on the train to treat sick passengers. The local government also sent flour, vegetables and more than a thousand eggs. With the Party's concern and the people's support being so kind and thoughtful, they felt that their fighting strength was even more abundant.
    Originally, it was already tiring enough for a service person to be solely responsible for the work in one carriage, but they took the initiative to become the best nannies for the children on the train, and also nurses for the patients. After a day of intense and tiring work, they quietly chased away flies and mosquitoes for the passengers, took care of the patients, and looked after the children. Train attendant Xia Wenying and others had not slept for a day and a night, their eyes were red, and their bodies were tired, but they never even thought about these things.
        Moving Forward in the Early Morning Glow
    July 24 was another beautiful day, and the people on the train were even more active. Suddenly, the car inspector shouted: "The Director is here!" The crew members happily jumped out of the carriage. Yang Guohui, the acting director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and the deputy secretary of the Shenyang Railway Bureau Party Committee personally rushed to the scene to express their condolences and greatly encourage all the crew members for their heroic deeds in fighting the flood, preserving the train and the lives of more than six hundred people on board, and rescuing the victims. The crew members were extremely excited, and the fatigue and thirst of several days and nights had long since disappeared.
    The train was scheduled to return to Shenyang the next morning. In order to eliminate the traces of the flood and return to Shenyang clean, the crew members decided to conduct a major cleaning on the train. Who knew that the passengers learned of this news, and more than eighty passengers in the ninth carriage joined the crew in washing the inside and outside of the car. When this was known to other carriages, it immediately set off a climax of a full train sanitation clean-up. After more than two hours of work, all eleven carriages were washed and refurbished, looking as beautiful as if they had just come out of the warehouse.
    In order to celebrate the victory over the flood, the train Party branch decided to organize a joint celebration party. In the evening, hundreds of passengers sat in a circle on an open space by the side of the road, and a rich and colorful joint celebration party began. Songs, piano music, joyful applause and laughter rose and fell, creating an extraordinary atmosphere.
    On the morning of July 25, the 12th train headed towards Shenyang in the early morning glow.
    The Shenyang Railway Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shenyang Railway Bureau awarded them the honorary title of "March 8th Youth Red Banner Car Crew" to commend their heroic spirit. The Minister of Railways personally met them and presented them with a certificate of merit. (Attached picture)

    英雄列车
    沈阳列车段三八青年红旗包车组战胜洪水的事迹
    三八青年红旗包车组是1958年夏季组成的，担负着沈阳——北京间特别旅客快车的列车乘务工作。全组共有四十七名职工，其中除乘警检车员和一名行李员是男同志以外，其余的都是女同志，平均年龄为二十岁左右。包车组有党团支部。在党的领导下，由于全组人员热心周到地为旅客服务，基本实现了待客如友的服务要求，因此在今年三八节前夕，荣获三八青年包车组的光荣称号。
        同洪水搏斗
    7月21日夜间，列车冒着瓢泼的大雨从沈阳站开车，奔向祖国的首都北京。雨越下越大。当列车跨进兴城车站时，接到通知：因连日雨水冲刷，路基松软了。列车慢行到前卫——高岭间的一座石河桥上，一位工务工长告诉司机说：前方路基被雨水灌成浆，还有的掏空了，不能前进！列车停在桥上。这时，副列车长李桂琴就叫醒了休班的列车党支部书记、民警李日奎同志，汇报了列车停在桥上的情况。李日奎同志下车一看，桥下河水继续暴涨，列车上六百名旅客生命财产受到严重的威胁。于是他便和运转车长一道决定并征得调度同意，把列车退回前卫车站。仅隔十六分钟，石河桥便被洪水冲毁了。全列车的旅客得知这个消息，无不庆幸自己脱险，许多旅客激动地说：再慢一刻钟我们就和洪水一块走了。
    列车退回前卫车站不久，忽见一位民兵边跑边喊：水库决口了……！随之发现西北方向白亮亮一片洪水向列车奔腾而来。在这洪水袭击面前，旅客都在呼喊：“快开车！开快车！”列车迅速向后退着。这时，线路两旁的居民扶老携幼，背着大小包裹纷纷奔向列车，呼喊求救。能见死不救吗？李日奎同志大喊：“停车救人！”司机立刻刹住车。又从广播机中通知乘务员和旅客们快把车窗门打开抢救人。这时虽然洪水已向列车冲击，但是人们首先想到的不是自己，而是车下受难的同胞。共产党员、列车行李员梁国治和许多乘务员、旅客都跳下车去把灾民救上来。洪水已经淹没了路基、钢轨、车轮，巨大的洪峰来到眼前。为了确保旅客生命财产安全，列车只得继续往后撤退，但是还有不少灾民向列车招手求救，列车又停下来抢救灾民。司机准确地操纵着列车，就这样退退停停，停了三次，抢救上来三百五十多名受灾的同胞。当列车进入高坡长河桥时，发现一个老太太坐在房盖上，在洪水的旋涡中打转转。列车员马玉林和旅客——解放军军官赵福祥先后跳进洪水中，把老太太从深水中救了出来。这时又从远处漂过来一根房梁，上面坐着一位老大爷。小马没顾得休息一下，又跳入水中直往老大爷游去。他游到半道接近急流时，眼看就被浪涛挡住，生命受到严重的威胁，岸上的人就把他拉回来了。当小马上来后，看到老大爷快被急流冲走，双手乱抓，危急万分。这时小马耳朵虽然嗡嗡直叫，头脑又胀又疼，混身已是筋疲力尽，但他一想到向秀丽、安业民的英雄事迹，从心里就涌出一股勇气，感到混身是劲。他第三次又跳进水中，但老大爷已被浪涛卷到急流中去了。站在桥头的李日奎同志，列车员陈宝志同志和旅客们就把大批绳子投入急流中，老大爷一把抓住绳子，岸上的人一起用力拉，终于把老大爷救上来了。就这样，乘务员和旅客一起又救出了九名将要被水淹死的灾民。
      组织起来战斗下去
    经过这样一场生死关头的战斗，洪峰虽然过去了，可是威胁并未消除，列车能否早些开动，前进或后退，又成为旅客最关心的事。支部书记根据这种情况召开了紧急会议，对好坏两种情况都做了估计。会议做了三项决议：一、共产党员要机智英勇不怕任何困难，带领群众与洪水搏斗；二、依靠全体旅客有组织地向铁路两旁躲避；三、积极与上级联系以便得到指示。接着，列车长张敏缓就和乘警到每节车厢发动旅客选派代表，协助维持车内秩序和保证旅客安全。很快地组成了一个包括四十名旅客的代表小组，在车上车下协助乘务员工作，使车内秩序井然不乱。
    洪水是否继续上涨，线路不知何日修通，旅客吃饭怎么办？……问题一大堆。多么迫切需要领导给予指示啊！列车长张敏缓和行李员梁国治把活动电话机接在铁路旁临时通话设备上，但是尽管喊哑了嗓子，也没能得到一声回答，证明通讯已经中断了。一切可能的尝试都失败了。不能与上级取得联系，列车支部只好勇敢地担起一切责任来。这时，乘务员和旅客已经有一天一夜没吃饭了；但是，乘务员们都把由沈阳出发时带的面包和香肠拿出来，送给苏联专家和小孩吃，旅客们看到这种情况，纷纷把自己包裹打开，把饼干、点心、鸡蛋等都拿了出来。不一会，各车厢送来的食品集成了一堆。这些食品包含多么崇高的友情啊！
    然而，吃饭问题仍然是当前的严重问题，党支部决定由支部书记李日奎带领乘务员和一些旅客外出找粮食。他们跑到距列车三里地的隋家岭去和人民公社党委联系，公社党委立即拨出十八袋白面；但需要到五里地以外的地方去扛。五十多名旅客和乘务员志愿担任了这项工作。面粉扛回来以后，立即组成了炊事小组，但是，那里来的做饭家具呢？十二次列车没有餐车，于是乘务员又跑回隋家岭人民公社借来十口大锅，有的社员把仅有的几捆干柴也拿出来，乘务员和旅客共同组成十个烙饼小组，经过多半天的劳动，香喷喷的大饼烙熟了。乘务员怕不够吃，让旅客先吃，一位旅客把一张大饼塞在李日奎手中，李日奎推说不饿，又把饼送了回去。这样推来推去，最后，李日奎只得撕下一小块饼吃了。
          党的关怀
    7月23日早晨，天还是雾气沉沉，列车仍不能行进，和领导联系也没有接上头。六百名旅客要吃饭要喝水，不少病人等待治疗。可是车上除了还剩几张昨天吃剩的白面饼和空空的救急箱之外，再没有什么了。这时，突然一阵马达声由远而近。“飞机！”人们不约而同地喊了出来，纷纷向车外跑去。一架银白色的飞机在列车上空盘旋。人们舞动着毛巾、帽子，按捺不住内心的激动，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”在人们的欢呼声中飞机投下许多降落伞，落在地下。啊！是四十大包饼干，上面写着“高级饼干慰问旅客”。旅客把饼干搜集在一起，谁也不肯吃，最后只好由乘务员分给旅客吃。吃到这香甜的饼干，感动得许多旅客流出了热泪。
    党的关怀来自四面八方，锦州铁路局党委发现十二次列车失踪后，派了七人小组，背着一千个烧饼，冒着狂风暴雨，沿铁路线走了一夜零一个早晨才把列车找到。他们又疲劳又饥饿，但带给旅客的烧饼，他们一个也没有吃。锦州铁路管理局和区委得知消息后，马上从山海关派来医生，在车上开办了临时诊疗所，给患病旅客治病。当地政府也给送来了面粉蔬菜和一千多个鸡蛋。党的关怀，群众的支持，是这样亲切周到，她们感到战斗力量更加充沛了。
    本来一个服务员专负一节车厢的工作，就已经够累了，可是她们主动地当起车上孩子们的最好的保姆，又兼患者的护士。白天紧张劳累一天，晚上又悄悄为旅客赶苍蝇、蚊子，照料病人，看护小孩。列车员夏文英等已有一天一夜没入睡了，眼睛熬得通红，身子也疲累不堪，可是这些她们连想也没想。
        迎着早霞前进
    7月24日又是个美好的天气，列车上的人更活跃了。突然检车员喊：“局长来了！”乘务员都高兴地跳下车厢，锦州铁路局杨国辉代局长和沈阳铁路局党委副书记亲自赶到现场慰问，对全体乘务员向洪水斗争、保全列车和车上六百多条生命、抢救受灾同胞的英勇事迹给予很大的鼓励。乘务员们异常兴奋，几天几夜的劳累饥渴早已无影无踪了。
    列车第二天早晨就要开回沈阳了。为了消除被洪水浸袭的痕迹，干干净净返回沈阳，乘务员们决定在列车上进行一次大清扫。那知这个消息被旅客知道了，第九节车厢的八十多名旅客就同乘务员一起把车内外全部洗刷干净。这事被其他车厢知道了，立即掀起一个全列车的卫生大扫除高潮。经过两个多小时劳动，十一节车厢全部洗刷一新，简直像刚出库一样漂亮。
    为了庆贺战胜洪水，列车党支部决定组织联欢晚会。傍晚，几百名旅客团团坐在路旁的一片空地上，一个丰富多彩的联欢晚会开始了。歌声、琴声、欢乐的掌声和欢笑声此起彼落，热闹异常。
    7月25日清晨，第十二次列车迎着早霞奔向沈阳。
    中共沈阳铁路局委员会和沈阳铁路局为了表扬她们的英勇精神，授给她们“三八青年红旗包车组”的光荣称号，铁道部长亲自接见她们并授给了奖状。（附图片）
