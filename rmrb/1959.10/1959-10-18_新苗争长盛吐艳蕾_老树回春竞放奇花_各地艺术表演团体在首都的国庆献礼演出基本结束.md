Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A summary by our reporter: The art troupes from various regions participating in the National Day performance gala in the capital to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China have now basically concluded their performances. This performance was a concentrated art exhibition, vividly demonstrating the leap-forward development of China's literary and artistic undertakings and the significant improvement of artistic standards over the past decade.

This performance gala was grand in scale, rich in content, and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. Starting from late September, in addition to the professional and amateur art units from Beijing and more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as the People's Liberation Army system and the trade union system, holding gala performances in the capital, major cities across the country also held National Day performance galas, forming a nationwide upsurge in artistic performances. In the capital, more than 3,000 artists from over a dozen ethnic groups participated in the performances. The Peking Opera, music, and dance evening held on October 3rd in the Great Hall of the People in the capital, with the participation of more than 2,500 people, was a concentrated expression of this performance. From September 21st to October 10th, during the 20 days, nearly 80 art units in Beijing performed a total of more than 410 shows, with an audience of more than 450,000 people. The attendance rate of most of the repertoire has consistently been 100%.

This performance fully demonstrated the correctness and victory of the Party's policy of "literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialist construction" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." The gala performance in Beijing included various art forms such as opera, drama, new opera, dance drama, music, folk dance, quyi (folk art forms), acrobatics, and puppet shows, concentrating on various themes, different forms, and styles of repertoire, as well as the most famous actors of various schools in China, truly a gathering of heroes where a hundred flowers bloomed in competition. From this performance, people can see both China's traditional national and folk art, and the new artistic flowers that have grown up since liberation—such as new opera, dance drama, and so on. The operas participating in this performance included more than a dozen types of opera from Beijing and Hebei, Shanghai, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, and other provinces and cities. The ethnic song and dance troupes from 13 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions performed songs and dances reflecting the joyful lives of the various ethnic groups, with distinct ethnic characteristics, showing the vigorous development of art in all ethnic groups in China.

This performance gala showcased the tremendous achievements of China's opera reform work, as well as the fruitful results of the diligent cultivation of drama, music, and dance workers, indicating that China's art has leapt to a new level. Opera programs such as Peking Opera's "Generals and Ministers Make Peace" and "The Drunken Concubine," Henan Opera's "The Matchmaker," Han Opera's "Twice Blooming Plum," Hunan Opera's "Life and Death Token," Qinqiang Opera's "Touring West Lake," and Sichuan Opera's "Forced Marriage" have all been refined and processed by veteran artists and new literary and art workers over the years, making them more ideologically elevated and artistically more complete. The Peking Opera "Eliminating the Three Evils," which was welcomed by Chinese and foreign audiences during the performance, was reorganized and improved from the "Hat Play," which was only sung after jumping the promotional official at the beginning in the past. Among the gala repertoire, there are also many treasures rescued from old paper piles and lost for many years. "On the Wall," the masterpiece of the great Yuan Dynasty playwright Bai Pu, which had been silent for three or four hundred years, has been reorganized and adapted this time, and has regained the appreciation of the majority of the audience with its anti-feudal theme and healthy, lively, and lyrical comedic style. "Mu Guiying Takes Command," adapted from the Henan Opera of the same name and starring the famous performing artist Mei Lanfang, although it depicts the story of a historical figure, the audience can learn from the middle-aged female hero Mu Guiying and the superb performance of this old artist a kind of progressive spirit of "the old tree does not age, the red flower is even more red."

From this performance, we can see that opera, drama, and music and dance have made new achievements in expressing revolutionary historical themes and the current lives and struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Peking Opera's "The White-Haired Girl" and Ping Opera's "Jinsha River" have taken solid steps in using opera art to express real life. A new prosperous situation has emerged on the drama stage. In addition to outstanding repertoires that express the past lives and struggles of the people, such as "Cai Wenji," "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," and "Rickshaw Boy," "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger" and "Blazing Red Heart," which reflect the Great Leap Forward in 1958, "Locust Tree Village," which depicts the great changes in rural areas in the past decade since liberation, and Lao She's new work "Family Portrait" were also performed this time. "The People's Commune Chorus," composed by Lin Shu'an and other students of the Central Conservatory of Music, is full of the momentum of a galloping horse in the Great Leap Forward. The common feature of these works is that they are not only ideologically strong but also shape the artistic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers with flesh and blood, which is a double harvest of ideological art achieved by literary and art workers after going deep into life. The reason why the drama "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger" is praised as "an ode to the Party's general line of socialist construction and a pastoral song depicting the strong and simple character of the working people" is mainly because the author of this play spent more than a year laboring, living, and breathing with the heroic people in the mountainous areas. The authors of "The People's Commune Chorus" lived with the people of the commune during the high tide of the people's commune last year. Many of the poems and musical phrases in this chorus were written by the authors in the footsteps of the peasants' Great Leap Forward and in the cornfields where they worked together with the peasants.

Many of the programs in this performance have significantly improved in terms of artistic level in creation, directing, performance, music, and stage art. Comparing the past and the present, the appearance of some types of operas and repertoires has changed beyond recognition. Old audiences who are familiar with Cantonese opera, after enjoying the "Guan Hanqing" that exudes the fragrance of the southern country and listening to the unforgettable "Butterfly Pair Flying," and then reminiscing about the vulgar atmosphere on the Cantonese opera stage before liberation, how can they not be grateful to the Party for making this "Southern Red Bean" shine again! The audience believes that many repertoires in this performance, such as Peking Opera's "The Orphan of Zhao," "Legend of the White Snake," Fujian Puxian Opera's "Father and Son's Hatred," and Yue Opera's "Dream of the Red Chamber," have greatly surpassed the past levels in terms of script structure, literature, performance, and directing. Young composer Luo Zhongrong used symphonic form to express huge political and historical themes. This symphony is magnificent in style and has national characteristics. It is recognized by Chinese and foreign audiences as a relatively excellent work. Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony," performed jointly by the Central Philharmonic Orchestra and other units, as well as many foreign dramas and musical works of world level performed this time, all demonstrate the perseverance and talent shown by the artistic workers of New China in learning world excellent art.

As the playwright Tian Han described in his new "Huanxi Sha," this performance is indeed "talented men and women of all ages." The actors participating in this performance range in age from twelve to sixty years old, which can be regarded as "five generations under one roof." Not only are the senior artists as strong as ever, but what is even more gratifying is that the audience has seen the brilliant prospects of China's socialist art from the excellent performances of many young actors.

The fundamental reason why this performance has achieved such great success is due to the correct leadership of the Party. The literary and art workers have been tested and tempered through the anti-Rightist and rectification movements and have strengthened their direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao once pointed out that a political situation with both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and individual ease of mind and lively vigor has begun to appear in the literary and art ranks. Under the guidance of the Party's general line of building socialism, the entire process of this performance gala is full of an atmosphere of great leap forward and great unity. The artistic workers showed a high degree of discipline and hard work in their tense work. At the same time, they also seized the time to study, exchange experiences, and learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses during the busy performances. After watching each other, everyone felt that others were making rapid progress and must catch up quickly and learn from others' advantages. The communist style of cooperation and mutual assistance has been greatly promoted. With infinite excitement, the artistic workers cheered for the great achievements of the motherland and thanked the Party's wise leadership and the people's kind care. They are determined to work hard to improve their ideological and artistic level and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and socialist construction. "Work hard to forge ahead and advance to new peaks, and dedicate more and better works to the Party and the people!" This is the determination and wish expressed by many artists participating in the gala performance at the symposium held a few days ago. (Attached photo)

　　新苗争长盛吐艳蕾　老树回春竞放奇花
    各地艺术表演团体在首都的国庆献礼演出基本结束
    新华社讯　本社记者综述：各地艺术表演团体在首都参加庆祝建国十周年的文艺献礼演出，目前已经基本上结束。这次演出是一次集中的艺术展览会，它生动地体现出十年来我国文艺事业的飞跃发展和艺术水平的显著提高。
    这次献礼演出规模盛大、内容丰富多采，受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。从9月下旬开始，除北京和来自二十多个省市、自治区以及中国人民解放军系统、工会系统的专业、业余艺术单位在首都举行献礼演出外，全国各大城市也分别举行了国庆献礼演出，形成了一个全国性的文艺演出高潮。在首都，参加演出的有十多个民族的三千多名艺术人员。10月3日在首都人民大会堂举行的二千五百多人参加的京剧音乐舞蹈晚会是这次演出的一次集中表现。从9月21日到10月10日的二十天里，在北京的近八十个艺术单位共演出了四百一十多场，观众达四十五万多人次。大部分剧目的上座率，一直是百分之百。
    这次演出充分表现出党的“文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务”以及“百花齐放、推陈出新”方针的正确和胜利。在北京参加献礼演出的有戏曲、话剧、新歌剧、舞剧、音乐、民间舞蹈、曲艺、杂技、木偶剧等各个艺术品种，集中了各种题材、不同形式和风格的剧目以及我国各派最著名的演员，真是一次百花争妍的群英会。人们从这次演出中，既可以看到我国传统的民族、民间艺术，也可以看到解放后才成长起来的新的艺术花朵——如新歌剧、舞剧等等。参加这次演出的戏曲，有北京和来自河北、上海、广东、陕西、四川、湖南、湖北、福建、河南、云南等省市的十多个剧种。来自十三个省、市、自治区的民族歌舞团演出的各民族歌舞，反映了各族人民的欢乐生活，具有鲜明的民族特点，显示出我国各族艺术的蓬勃发展。
    这次献礼演出显示了我国戏曲改革工作的巨大成就，以及话剧、音乐、舞蹈工作者等辛勤耕耘的丰硕成果，表明我国的艺术已经跃进到一个新的水平线上。戏曲节目如京剧的“将相和”、“贵妃醉酒”，豫剧的“红娘”，汉剧的“二度梅”，湘剧的“生死牌”，秦腔的“游西湖”，川剧的“拉郎配”等，都是经过老艺人和新文艺工作者几年来千锤百炼的整理加工，使它们思想性更提高，艺术上更加完整。演出中受到中外观众欢迎的京剧“除三害”，就是根据过去只在开场跳加官以后唱一唱的“帽儿戏”整理提高而成的。献礼剧目中，还有不少是从故纸堆中抢救出来的、失传多年的珍品。绝响三四百年、元代大剧作家白朴的名作“墙头马上”，这次经过整理、改编，又以它反封建的主题和健康、明快、抒情的喜剧格调，重新获得了广大观众的赞赏。根据同名豫剧改编、由著名表演艺术家梅兰芳主演的“穆桂英挂帅”，虽然描写的是历史人物的故事，但是，观众可以从中年挂帅的女英雄穆桂英和这位老艺术家的精湛表演中领会到一种“老树树不老、红花花更红”的跃进精神。
    从这次演出，可以看到戏曲、话剧和音乐舞蹈等在表现革命历史题材和工农兵当前的生活和斗争方面取得了新的成就。京剧“白毛女”、评剧“金沙江畔”在运用戏曲艺术表现现实生活的道路上迈出了坚实的一步。话剧舞台上出现了新的繁荣局面，除去表现过去人民的生活和斗争的优秀剧目“蔡文姬”、“雷雨”、“日出”、“骆驼祥子”等以外，这次还演出了反映1958年大跃进的“降龙伏虎”、“烈火红心”，描写解放十年来农村巨变的“槐树庄”以及老舍新作“全家福”等。中央音乐学院学生林树安等创作的“人民公社大合唱”洋溢着万马奔腾的跃进气势。这些作品的共同特点是不仅思想性强，而且塑造出有血有肉的工农兵艺术形象，这是文艺工作者深入生活以后取得的思想艺术双丰收。话剧“降龙伏虎”所以被誉为“党的社会主义建设总路线的颂歌、描绘劳动人民刚毅淳朴性格的牧歌”，主要是由于这个剧的作者曾经以一年多的时间，和山区的英雄人民同劳动、同生活、共呼吸。“人民公社大合唱”的作者在去年人民公社化高潮中，同公社人民生活在一起。这个大合唱的许多诗词和乐句就是作者在农民大跃进的脚步声中，在他们和农民共同劳动的玉米田里写下来的。
    这次演出的许多节目在创作、导演、表演、音乐、舞台美术的艺术水平方面都有了显著的提高。今昔对比，有些剧种和剧目的面貌已经变得使人不敢认了。熟悉粤剧的老观众，当欣赏了散发着南国香气的“关汉卿”，听过那令人难忘的“蝶双飞”以后，再回味一下解放以前粤剧舞台上的庸俗风气，怎能不感激党使这颗“南国红豆”重放光彩！观众认为，这次演出的京剧“赵氏孤儿”、“白蛇传”、福建蒲仙戏“父子恨”、越剧“红楼梦”等许多剧目，在剧本结构、文学性和表演、导演等方面都大大超越了过去的水平。青年作曲家罗忠熔运用交响乐形式，表现了巨大的政治、历史主题。这部交响乐的气魄雄伟，具有民族特色，是中外观众公认的一个比较优秀的作品。中央乐团等单位联合演出的贝多芬“第九交响乐”以及这次演出的许多具有世界水平的外国话剧、音乐作品，都显示出新中国的艺术工作者在学习世界优秀艺术方面表现的毅力和才能。
    正如剧作家田汉在他新作的“浣溪沙”中所描绘的，这次演出确是“老少男坤饶俊才”。这次参加演出的演员从十二岁到六十多岁，可以够得上“五世同堂”。不仅前辈艺人们老当益壮，更可喜的是，观众们从许许多多青年演员的优异表演中，看到了我国社会主义艺术的灿烂前景。
    这次演出所以取得这样巨大的成就，根本原因是由于党的正确领导。文艺工作者经过反右派和整风运动的考验、锻炼，坚定了为工农兵服务的方向。毛主席曾经指出过的，又有集中又有民主的，又有纪律又有自由的，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面，开始在文艺队伍中出现了。在党的建设社会主义总路线的照耀下，这次献礼演出的整个过程，充满着大跃进、大团结的气氛。艺术工作者们在紧张的工作中表现了高度的纪律性和刻苦耐劳的精神，同时在繁忙的演出中还抓紧时间进行学习，交流经验，取长补短。经过互相观摩，大家都感到别人进步很快，必须急起直追，学习别人的优点。协作互助的共产主义风格大大发扬。艺术工作者们以无限兴奋的心情欢呼祖国的伟大成就，感谢党的英明领导和人民的亲切关怀，他们立志要努力提高自己的思想和艺术水平，更好地为工农兵、为社会主义建设服务。“发奋图强，向新的高峰挺进，把更多更好的作品献给党和人民！”这就是参加献礼演出的许多艺术家在几天前举行的座谈会上表示的决心和愿望。（附图片）
