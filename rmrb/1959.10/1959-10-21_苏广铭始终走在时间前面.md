Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th: Su Guangming, a well-known pacesetter on the industrial front in Harbin, has once again been selected as an advanced producer representative to attend the National "Conference of Heroes."

Su Guangming is an old milling worker at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant. According to production quota calculations, he completed seventeen years' worth of work in the six years and nine months from January 1953 to September this year. Currently, he is working at an even faster pace to ensure he fulfills his promise of completing 9 months of work in the fourth quarter.

In the past few years, Su Guangming has continuously innovated more than seventy technologies, increasing production efficiency by one to twenty times respectively. The fifteen technical innovations he achieved in the first three quarters of this year have played a significant role in the plant's completion of the task of increasing the production of three hundred newly built freight cars this year. His newly created "template" for milling "saddle plates" has increased the production capacity of milling machines by thirty-one times. He added an "auxiliary tool holder" to the gantry planer, reducing the idle time of the planer, so that one renovated planer can be used in place of the original two.

Su Guangming's ability to always stay ahead of time and overfulfill his tasks ahead of schedule is the result of his close reliance on the masses and his willingness to learn from advanced experiences under the leadership of the Party. Over the past few years, he has studied more than forty advanced experiences, both domestic and foreign. He never misses any opportunity to learn advanced experiences.

    苏广铭始终走在时间前面
    据新华社哈尔滨20日电　哈尔滨工业战线上的著名的标兵苏广铭，又被评选为出席全国“群英会”的先进生产者代表。
    苏广铭是哈尔滨机车车辆厂的老铣工。按照生产定额计算，他在1953年1月到今年9月的六年多时间内，共完成了十七年的工作量。目前，他正在以更快的速度，保证实现在第四季度完成9个月工作量的诺言。
    在过去的几年里，苏广铭连续革新了七十多项技术，分别提高生产效率一倍到二十倍；他在今年的前三个季度中实现的十五项技术革新，对于全厂今年完成增产三百辆新造货车的任务，起了很大作用。他新创造的铣制“从板座”的新“胎型”，使铣床的生产能力提高了三十一倍；他给龙门刨床增加了一个“辅助刀架”，减除了刨床跑空的时间，一台革新了的刨床能顶原来的两台使用。
    苏广铭能够一直走在时间前面、提前超额完成任务，是他在党的领导下，紧紧依靠群众、虚心学习先进经验的结果。几年来，他学习的国内外先进经验，共有四十多项。他从不放过任何能够学到先进经验的机会。
