　　Starting from "Hand"
　　Cheng Maolin
　　One use of the hand is to grasp. We often hear people say: so-and-so grasps a certain problem well, they are a good hand at it; so-and-so is showing their skills in grasping a certain task, and so on. It is evident that how well something is grasped is the basis for evaluating a hand. The Journey to the West says that Sun Wukong could travel 108,000 miles in one somersault, but he still couldn't jump out of the Buddha's palm; that was also a giant hand. But that's just a myth! However, our Party's leadership in socialist construction has already surpassed that.
　　The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, as soon as it met the masses, turned into a huge driving force, and our country immediately presented a new scene of soaring industrial production and a green expanse signaling a bumper harvest in agricultural production. In Shandong, where the author is located, naturally, like all parts of the country, a new upsurge of the magnificent and vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy is surging. On all fronts of socialist construction, the battle drums are beating in unison, and good news is pouring in. In early August, the average daily output of iron in the province was still at a record of 3,411 tons, rising to 3,750 tons in mid-August, soaring to 4,021 tons in late August, and breaking through the 5,000-ton mark on September 6. In October, the momentum was maintained with a good start. The average daily output of steel is also increasing day by day and with each passing moment. These are not just numbers, but great epics. It is these rapidly changing achievements that have created the flower garden of socialist construction in the motherland; it is these triumphant songs that have composed the symphony of socialist construction; it is these achievements that have built the magnificent socialist construction edifice; it is these achievements that have equipped the train of the times, speeding towards communism; it is these achievements that inspire the people of the whole country to be full of spirit, singing and advancing triumphantly; and all these achievements are created by the working people under the leadership of the Party with their own hands.
　　The power of the Party's resolutions is enormous. Where does this power come from? It lies in the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's ability to perceive the situation and grasp the demands of the people of the whole country, reflecting the magnificent aspirations of the 600 million people; it lies in the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao standing in front of the mass movement of 600 million people to carry out socialist construction, leading the masses to open up a new era. The masses say it well: the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are truly wise, as if they have seen into our hearts. Eliminate rightism, and our enthusiasm is endless. If the leaders can go to the sea, we dare to capture the dragon. If we are united from top to bottom, socialism can be built early. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have the hands of Marxism-Leninism, so they grasp socialist construction well; this is the fundamental reason why people praise the Party and its leaders as wise helmsmen.
　　However, the right-leaning opportunists are short-sighted, failing to recognize Mount Tai, and inevitably stumble. Even if they also have a pair of hands, they are just the hands of right-leaning opportunists, who can only run to the Dragon King to search for those so-called "materials" that cannot be seen or touched, pouring cold water on the mass movement of 600 million people to carry out socialist construction, attempting to prevent the wheel of history from moving forward, creating ideological confusion, and achieving their goal of muddling the waters. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize rightism, boost our energy, break the hands of right-leaning opportunists, promote the hands of Marxism-Leninism, hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and in the boiling ocean of socialist construction, let us have an Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, each displaying their abilities!

　　从“手”谈起
　　程茂林
    手有一用谓之抓，我们经常听到人们讲：某人某个问题抓得好，是把好手；某人在抓某件工作上大显身手等。可见抓得如何是评价手的根据。西游记上说孙悟空一个筋斗十万八千里，还跳不出佛祖的手掌，那也是一只巨手。但只不过是神话故事而已！可是我们党在对社会主义建设的领导上，却已有过之无不及了。
    党的八届八中全会的决议，一和群众见面，便变成了巨大的动力，我国就立刻呈现出工业生产青云直上，农业生产一片绿野兆丰年的新的景象。笔者所在的山东，自然和全国各地一样，一个波澜壮阔的增产节约运动的新高潮，正汹涌澎湃地掀起来了。在社会主义建设的各条战线上是战鼓齐鸣，捷报频传。在8月上旬，全省铁的平均日产量还在三千四百一十一吨的纪录上，中旬上升到三千七百五十吨，下旬急升到四千零二十一吨，到9月6日就突破了五千吨大关，到10月份就保持开门红了。钢的平均日产量也是与日俱增，与时俱增。这不是数字，乃是伟大的史诗。就是这些日新月异的成就绘成了祖国社会主义建设的花坛；就是这些凯歌组成了社会主义建设的交响曲；就是这些成就筑成着光辉灿烂的社会主义建设大厦；就是这些成就配成了时代的列车，朝着共产主义飞奔而去；就是这些成就鼓舞着全国人民意气风发，高歌猛进；而这些成绩，无一不是党领导着劳动人民用自己的双手创造出来的。
    党的决议的力量是巨大的，这力量的源泉在哪里呢？在党中央和毛主席善于洞察形势，抓住了全国人民的要求，反映了六亿人民的宏伟志愿；在党中央和毛主席站在六亿人民大搞社会主义建设的群众运动的前面，领导人民群众开拓新的纪元。群众说得好：党中央和毛主席真英明，就像到咱心里看过一样。扫除右倾，干劲无穷，领导能下海，我们敢擒龙，上下一致，团结无间，社会主义就能早建成。党中央和毛主席有马列主义之手，所以对社会主义建设抓得好；这也就是为什么人们把党和党的领导人称颂为英明的舵手的根本原因。
    可是右倾机会主义者鼠目寸光，有眼不识泰山，不相信党的领导和群众的力量，因此免不了要跌跤。他们纵然也有一双手，不过是右倾机会主义者之手，只能跑到龙王那里去搜罗那些看不到、摸不着的所谓“材料”，向六亿人民大搞社会主义建设的群众运动大泼冷水，妄图阻止历史的车轮向前，制造思想混乱，达其混水摸鱼之目的。因此，我们必须把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，破右倾机会主义者之手，兴马列主义之手，高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，在沸腾的社会主义建设的海洋里，来一个八仙过海，各显其能！
