Your Excellency:

It is a great pleasure for me to take this opportunity to write to Your Excellency to express my friendship and love, and to have a friendly delegation from our country deliver this letter to you, at this historic moment of celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China. This delegation has been appointed to join the great Chinese people in this great historic anniversary in the name of the Republic of Iraq, and to extend to Your Excellency and the friendly Chinese people my warmest congratulations on behalf of myself and the Iraqi people who admire and praise your remarkable achievements.

While celebrating your National Day, we also celebrate the great achievements made by the Chinese people in these ten years. In each of these ten years, the Chinese people have achieved greater achievements than the previous year. In their efforts, in organization and production, they have adopted such clever and ingenious methods as to be worthy of emulation by those revolutionary and emerging countries. These countries are racing against time in this liberated world to catch up with the ranks of the liberated world civilization.

We are convinced that the spirit of friendly cooperation is very important for us to complete our noble cause, ensure the happiness of the people of both countries, and strengthen the sincere and beautiful ties that already exist between our two countries. Therefore, it is very beneficial to our two countries and helps us to defeat evil forces and achieve victory in the cause of world peace.

Another thing that makes me very happy is that the Embassy of the Republic of Iraq was established in Beijing shortly before your great National Day. The establishment of the embassy may better promote our joint efforts to consolidate the friendship and fruitful cooperation between our two countries. Undoubtedly, you will take care of and assist our embassy in all aspects, just as we have always tried our best to support your embassy, which is very dear to us.

In today's advanced scientific century, when we are laying the foundation for relations between two emerging countries, we are in fact restoring the flourishing and long-standing cultural and economic relations that existed between our two countries when mankind was still in a state of backwardness and ignorance. Since in ancient times, two countries with a long history could cooperate and exchange experiences with each other despite the long distance, it is more possible to carry out this work in today's era of widespread knowledge, cultural dissemination, and shortened distances.

Finally, I am very pleased to once again express our cherishment of our friendship with your great country, and once again extend my sincere congratulations to you and the esteemed Chinese people.

Qassem, Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq
Baghdad, September 23

    伊拉克总理卡塞姆给周总理的贺信阁下：
    在庆祝中华人民共和国光荣十周年的历史性的时刻能借此机会写信给阁下表达我对您满怀的友情和热爱，并由我国的一个友好代表团把信转上，这对我来说是莫大的愉快。这个代表团被委派来以伊拉克共和国的名义同伟大的中国人民在一起参加这个伟大的历史性的周年纪念，并代表我个人和对你们所取得的卓越成就钦佩和赞扬的伊拉克人民，向阁下和友好的中国人民致以最热忱的祝贺。
    在庆贺你们国庆的时候，我们同时也庆贺中国人民在这十年中所取得的伟大成就。在这十年的每一年中，中国人民都获得了比前一年更大的成就。他们在努力的过程中，在组织和生产上，采用了如此聪明巧妙的方法，以致值得为那些革命和新兴的国家所仿效。这些国家正在这解放的世界上紧紧地和时间赛跑，在赶上解放了的世界文明的行列。
    我们确信友好合作的精神对于我们完成崇高的事业、保障两国人民的幸福和加强我们两国间现已存在的诚挚美好的联系都是很重要的，因而，对于我们两国是十分有利的，并且有助于我们击退恶势力和在争取世界和平的事业中取得胜利。
    另外一件事使我感到非常愉快的是，在贵国伟大的国庆节前不久，在北京建立了伊拉克共和国大使馆，大使馆的建立有可能更好地促进我们共同的努力来巩固我们两国之间的友谊和卓有成效的合作关系。无疑的，您一定会在各方面关怀和协助我国大使馆，正像我们一贯尽力支持贵国大使馆一样，它对我们来说是非常亲切的。
    在今天这个先进的科学世纪里，当我们在奠定两个新兴国家之间关系的基础时，事实上是在恢复那当人类还处在落后愚昧无知状态时就在我们两国间存在的蓬勃发展的悠久的文化和经济关系。既然在久远的年代里，两个历史悠久的国家能不顾路途的遥远而相互进行合作和交流经验，那么处在今日知识大量普及、文化传布和距离缩短的时代里，是更有可能来开展这一工作了。
    最后，我再次十分愉快地表示我们对你们伟大国家的友谊的珍视，并再次向您和尊贵的中国人民致以诚挚的祝贺。
                            伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆
                                      9月23日于巴格达
