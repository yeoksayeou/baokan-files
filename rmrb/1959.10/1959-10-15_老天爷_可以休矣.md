“Old Man Heaven” Can Retire
　　Yang Qi
　　There are people with the strangest way of thinking: When many places have bumper harvests, they attribute it to "Old Man Heaven," saying it's because of "favorable weather"; when some places suffer from disasters and reduced harvests, they attribute it to the People's Communes, saying it's because "the communes are run poorly." The root of this way of thinking is deeply embedded in the soil of a reactionary stance. It seems that the two ways of accounting are different in form, but in essence, they are the same—opposing the people and failing to see the power of the people.

　　Do natural conditions have an impact on agricultural production? It cannot be denied that they have some impact. However, natural conditions will never only work when "heavenly timing and geographical advantages" are good, and not work when "heavenly timing and geographical advantages" are bad. More importantly, "human harmony" plays a decisive role in any situation. With "human harmony," good "heavenly timing and geographical advantages" can be fully utilized, and bad "heavenly timing and geographical advantages" can also be changed accordingly. The higher the degree of "human harmony," the more it can master and apply the laws of nature and conquer "heaven" and "earth."

　　Many People's Communes have achieved unprecedented and comprehensive bumper harvests this year, and Kangjinjing Commune in Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, is one of them. This commune has bumper harvests in everything, on every piece of land. The average yield of grain crops per mu can reach more than 300 jin, an increase of more than three-quarters compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The commune members smile at the grain in their hearts, and their enthusiasm is higher than ever. Where did the bumper harvest come from? Some people say: This is "Old Man Heaven opening his eyes," it is the result of "favorable weather." The broad masses of commune members launched a counterattack against this statement. A good counterattack!

　　There was a time when people almost entirely "relied on heaven for food," but that era has long passed. That was an era when there was no "human harmony" to speak of at all, an era when exploiters like Li Yunge of Kangjinjing Commune called "Zhang Bapi" rode on the heads of the working people. In the best "heavenly timing" conditions of that era, in good years like 1932 with "favorable weather"; and with the best "geographical advantages," like the prime land occupied by "Zhang Bapi"; how much could one mu yield? No more than 150 or 160 jin. In 1952, a few years after the land reform, the mutual aid and cooperation movement began to develop; the conditions for "human harmony" began to appear, but it was only a smaller "human harmony." In the "favorable weather" years of that time, like 1952, the yield of the best land in the area was only over 200 jin. Last year, large communes were merged and communes were established, and an unprecedentedly high degree of "human harmony" appeared in the history of the countryside. This year, the local "heavenly timing" is similar to 1932 and 1952, and even encountered more than 30 days of spring drought. However, on a large area of hundreds of square kilometers, averaging good and bad land, the grain yield per mu is more than 300 jin. What is the reason? The best answer is a single sentence from the commune members: "It cannot be done without the People's Commune." In the past, people asked fortune-tellers to determine their "fate," looking at the "annual luck" and calculating the "eight characters"; now, people rely on the powerful strength of the commune and use a completely different "eight characters"—the "Eight-Character Charter" determines the "fate" of the bumper harvest of crops: tens of thousands of acres of land are turned over, thousands of jin of fertilizer per mu, underground spring water sprays upwards, low-yield and inferior seeds are eliminated, narrow ridges and increased rows make for good close planting, pests are eradicated, cultivation management is refined and meticulous, and tool reform is even newer. Also: political command improves labor efficiency by about 30%; collective welfare undertakings liberate 90% of the female labor force; commune-run industry saves the commune tens of thousands of man-days and animal-days in just one aspect of grain processing...

　　The People's Commune members have a heroic slogan: "Strangle Old Man Heaven!" "Old Man Heaven" has always been opposed to the working people, and the working people have never had a good impression of "Old Man Heaven." In the era of small-scale farming, farmers could only helplessly "respect and keep away" from "Old Man Heaven." Now, it is the era when "Old Man Heaven" surrenders, relinquishes power, and makes way for the working people. "I am the Jade Emperor, I am the Dragon King!" The new "Old Man Heaven" is the entire body of commune members who have become giants standing under the red flag of the People's Commune. Even if the year is bad, we will have a bumper harvest; if the year is good, we will have an even greater bumper harvest. Who still wants to paint the original "Old Man Heaven" with gold to scare the working people? Still want to rely on that "Old Man Heaven" who is dedicated to opposing the working people to protect their "good days" of bullying the working people? Still want to use "Old Man Heaven" as a talisman to cover up their attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism? Don't even think about it!

### “老天爷”可以休矣

　　“老天爷”可以休矣
　　杨弃
    有这样一种人，他们有一种最奇怪的思想方法：许多地方大丰收了，他们要把这算在“老天爷”的账上，说是因为“风调雨顺”；有些地方遭灾歉收了，他们却要把这算在人民公社的账上，说是因为“公社办糟了”。这种思想方法的根，是深深地扎在反动立场的土壤上的。看起来，两种算账的观点，形式上是两样；其实，两者的实质是相同的——反对人民，看不到人民的力量。
    自然条件对农业生产有没有影响呢？不能否认，有一定的影响。可是，自然条件决不会只在“天时、地利”好的情况下起作用，在“天时、地利”不好的情况下就不起作用。更重要的是，“人和”在任何情况下都起决定性的作用。有了“人和”，好的“天时、地利”才能充分地发挥作用，不好的“天时、地利”也能够相应地发生变化。“人和”的程度越高，越能掌握和运用自然规律，征服“天”“地”。
    许许多多人民公社今年得到了空前的、全面的大丰收，黑龙江呼兰县康金井公社就是其中的一个。这个社样样丰收，块块丰收。粮食作物平均亩产可达三百多斤，比大跃进的1958年又增加了四分之三以上。社员们瞅着粮食心里笑，一个比一个干劲高。大丰收是从哪里得来的？有人说：这是“老天爷睁了眼”，是“风调雨顺”的结果。广大社员群众对这种说法展开了反击。反击得好！
    几乎完全“靠天吃饭”的时代是有的，可是，那样的时代早已过去了。那是根本说不上“人和”的时代，是像康金井公社社员李云阁说的“张扒皮”之类的剥削者骑在劳动人民头上的时代。在那时代的最好的“天时”条件下，像1932年那样“风调雨顺”的好年头；又有最好的“地利”，像“张扒皮”占有的那样的头等地；一亩打多少？不过一百五、六十斤。1952年，土地改革以后几年了，互助合作运动开始发展了；“人和”的条件开始出现了，可是，还只是较小的“人和”。那时的“风调雨顺”的年头，像1952年，当地最好的土地的产量也只有二百多斤。去年，并大社，办公社，在农村历史上出现了空前的高度的“人和”。今年，当地的“天时”同1932年、1952年相差不多，甚至还碰到了三十多天的春旱。可是，在几百平方公里的大面积上，好地坏地平均起来，粮食亩产量却是三百多斤。原因何在？社员们的一句话就是最好的回答：“没有人民公社是办不到的。”过去，人们决定自己的“命运”要请算命先生，看“流年”，算“八字”；现在，人们依靠公社的强大力量，运用一种完全不同的“八字”——“八字宪法”决定了庄稼大丰收的“命运”：万顷土地大翻身，肥料一亩几千斤，地下泉水向上喷，低产劣种绝了根，缩垅增行密植好，还叫害虫断子孙，耕耘管理精又精，工具改革更翻新。还有：政治挂帅使劳动效率提高大约30％；集体福利事业解放了90％的妇女劳动力；社办工业仅在加工粮食一个方面就使公社节省了数以万计的人工、畜工……
    人民公社社员们有一个豪迈的口号：“气死老天爷！”“老天爷”一向是与劳动人民作对的，劳动人民对“老天爷”向来没有好感。在小农经济时代，农民对“老天爷”也只是莫可奈何地“敬而远之”。现在，是“老天爷”向劳动人民投降、交权、让位的时代了。“我就是玉皇，我就是龙王！”新的“老天爷”就是站在人民公社红旗下变成顶天立地的巨人的全体公社社员。年头不好也要丰收；年头好就要更大丰收。谁还想给原先的“老天爷”粉刷金身来吓唬劳动人民吗？还想靠那专和劳动人民作对的“老天爷”保住他们欺负劳动人民的“好日子”吗？还想拿“老天爷”当护身符掩护他们向党向人民向社会主义进攻吗？休想！
