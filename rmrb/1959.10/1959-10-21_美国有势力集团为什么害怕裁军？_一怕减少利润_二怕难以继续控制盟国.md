Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch:

    The new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government has received widespread attention from world public opinion. This proposal opens a new and realistic path for resolving the disarmament issue. Gradually implementing this proposal can greatly ease international tensions, eliminate the threat of war, and establish a reliable guarantee for world peace. Peace-loving people around the world warmly welcome and support this significant new peace initiative from the Soviet Union.

    Within the imperialist aggressive bloc, however, a severe "peace phobia" has erupted. The day after Khrushchev proposed complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations on September 18, Associated Press reporter Hightower reported from Washington that U.S. State Department officials admitted that the proposal was deeply popular. They said privately, "The terrible thing about this is that you can't oppose it." Then they tried their best to publicize how difficult it would be "to advance an inch toward this (complete and thorough disarmament) goal." Why is it so "terrible"? Why make such an effort to prevent "advancing an inch"?

    The root cause lies in the American monopoly consortium that has been profiting from the arms race. People remember that after the heads of the Soviet and American governments announced mutual visits in early August, the New York stock market experienced a major plunge, with capitalists worried that "the Cold War might thaw" and "might lead to a reduction in the U.S. military budget." After Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament in September, the stock prices of American arms companies fell again. The "New York Times" pointed out that this was due to the Soviet proposal increasing the fear "that has been closely following Wall Street since Khrushchev's visit to the United States was still in the planning stage." The tendency towards easing international tensions is also occurring at a time when the United States is mired in serious financial difficulties due to long-term, frantic arms buildup. The U.S. budget deficit for the 1959 fiscal year reached 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, and the national debt has now exceeded 290 billion U.S. dollars. There is tremendous pressure on finances to cut government spending. American newspapers recently reported that various international and domestic factors may cause the United States to make "the largest scale reduction in next year's military budget since the Korean armistice." The monopoly consortium, watching this possibility of reduced profits, is truly terrified.

    It is from this mentality that American newspapers have been spreading the argument that "the Cold War is far from over" in recent days. Some powerful figures in the United States have also personally come forward to continue inciting the "Cold War." On October 7, Vice President Nixon called on Western military bloc countries not to "relax their efforts" in expanding their armaments. On October 13 and 14, Defense Secretary McElroy repeatedly emphasized that "the West must maintain its military strength," and that U.S. military spending next year will continue to remain at the current level of 41 billion U.S. dollars. On October 18, Assistant Secretary of State Wilcox clamored that the Western world "must not relax their defenses." Washington officials are thus busy giving Wall Street bosses a reassurance.

    Another fear of the powerful groups in the United States is that an easing of the international situation will make it more difficult for the United States to steer its allies to continue on the path of arms expansion and war preparations. The United States will no longer be able to rely on this path to control its allies. A "study report" on U.S. policy toward Western Europe, released by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on October 15, worriedly pointed out that current developments may affect "the morale and determination of Western European countries" and may "cause disunity and disintegration within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The report advocated that the United States should "exercise stronger leadership," send more American troops to Western Europe, and urge Western European countries to establish a larger number of "nuclear forces." The United States has recently passed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and Central Treaty Organization council meetings one after another to further tighten the screws on these military machines, apparently implementing the same "leadership."

    It is also worth noting that recently, the United States has been accelerating its pace of establishing missile bases around the world and conducting military exercises everywhere. According to reports, the United States has reached an agreement with Turkey to establish missile bases in Turkey, and American missiles equipped with nuclear warheads will be shipped to Italy in December this year. Before the end of this year, the United States will give more than 30 missile units to the armies of West Germany, Britain, and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, and the Japanese army will soon receive a batch of American missiles. After the North Atlantic Group held nearly ten large-scale naval exercises in the vast sea area from the western Atlantic to the eastern Mediterranean in less than a month, the Central Treaty Organization will hold naval exercises in the Arabian Sea, and the United States will also conduct missile tests in Okinawa. All of these are rampant provocations against the good wishes of people of all countries to ease the international situation, and are also steps taken by the United States to deliberately strengthen its control over its allies.

    U.S. government leaders have recently said a lot about wishing to melt the ice of the Cold War. When the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, U.S. representative Lodge also stated on October 14 that he would "conduct the most serious study" of the Soviet proposal. However, actions speak louder than words. How can the United States' various actions of inciting the "Cold War" and intensifying military deployments be reconciled with those peaceful words? These practical actions can only show that there is still a significant force in the United States that stubbornly prevents the easing of the international situation, opposes ending the "Cold War" and achieving disarmament, and is using various methods to try to maintain and exacerbate international tensions.

### 美国有势力集团为什么害怕裁军？  一怕减少利润　二怕难以继续控制盟国

    美国有势力集团为什么害怕裁军？
    一怕减少利润　二怕难以继续控制盟国
    新华社20日讯　苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军的新建议，受到世界舆论的广泛重视。这个建议为解决裁军问题打开了一条新的、现实的道路，逐步实现这个建议，能够大大和缓国际紧张局势，消除战争威胁，为世界和平建立可靠的保证。全世界爱好和平的人民都热烈欢迎和支持苏联这个新的重大和平倡议。
    而在帝国主义侵略集团里，却又发作起严重的“和平恐惧症”来。在赫鲁晓夫9月18日在联合国提出全面彻底裁军建议后的第二天，美联社记者海托华从华盛顿报道，美国国务院官员承认这个建议深得人心，他们私下说，“在这方面可怕的是你无法反对”，接着他们又竭力宣传很难“朝着这个（全面彻底裁军）目标前进一寸”。为什么会这样“可怕”呢？为什么要这样拼命阻止“前进一寸”呢？
    根源在于一直从军备竞赛中谋取暴利的美国垄断财团。人们记得，今年8月初苏美两国政府首脑宣布相互访问后，纽约股票市场发生过一场大跌风，资本家纷纷担心“冷战可能解冻”，“可能导致美国军事预算的减少”。9月间赫鲁晓夫访问美国以及苏联提出全面彻底裁军建议以后，美国军火公司的股票价格又形下跌，“纽约时报”指出，这是由于苏联建议增加了“在赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问还处于计划阶段以来就一直紧跟着华尔街”的恐惧。国际局势中出现缓和的趋向，也正是在美国由于长期疯狂备战而陷入严重的财政金融困难的时候。1959财政年度美国预算赤字高达一百二十五亿美元，国债目前已经超过二千九百亿美元。财政上有着巨大的压力，要求削减政府开支。美国报纸最近报道，国际和国内种种因素，可能使得美国要对明年军事预算“作朝鲜停战以来的大规模削减”。垄断财团注视着这种减少利润的可能性，真是惊恐万状。
    正是从这种心理出发，美国报刊近些日子来又在大肆散布“冷战远不会结束”的论调。美国一些有权势的人物又亲自出马继续煽动“冷战”。10月7日，副总统尼克松号召西方军事集团国家在扩军上不能“放松努力”。10月13日和14日，国防部长麦克耳罗伊一再强调“西方一定要保持它的军事力量”，明年美国的军事开支仍将继续保持在目前四百一十亿美元的水平。10月18日，助理国务卿威耳科克斯又叫嚷西方世界“决不能放松它们的防务”。华盛顿的官员们便是这样忙着在给华尔街的老板们吃定心丸。
    美国有势力集团恐惧的另一方面是，国际局势缓和，会使美国更难于驾驭它的盟国继续在扩军备战的轨道上前进，美国便不能再依仗这条轨道控制住盟国。美国参议院外交委员会10月15日公布的一份美国对西欧政策“研究报告”就忧虑地指出，目前局势发展可能影响“西欧国家的士气和决心”，可能“引起北大西洋公约组织的人心涣散和分崩离析”。这个报告鼓吹美国要“实行更有力的领导”，增派美国军队去西欧，督促西欧国家建立更多数量的“核部队”。美国最近接连通过东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织理事会会议，进一步扭紧这些军事机器上的螺丝钉，显然也就是在实施着同样的“领导”。
    还值得注意的是，最近一个时期来，美国正加快步伐，在世界各地建立导弹基地，并且到处进行军事演习。据报道，美国已同土耳其达成在土耳其建立导弹基地的协议，美国装备核弹头的导弹今年12月将运入意大利。今年年底以前美国将给予西德、英国等北大西洋集团国家军队三十多个导弹单位，日本军队即将获得一批美国导弹。北大西洋集团刚刚在不到一个月的时间内，在大西洋西部到地中海东部的广阔海面上举行过近十次大规模海军演习后，中央条约组织又将在阿拉伯海举行海军演习，美国还将在冲绳岛举行导弹试验。所有这些，都是对各国人民缓和国际局势善良期望的猖狂挑衅，也是美国蓄意加强控制它盟国的步骤。
    美国政府领导人最近是说过不少愿望融解冷战冰块之类的话，在联合国大会政治委员会讨论苏联全面彻底裁军建议时，美国代表洛奇10月14日也表示要对苏联建议“进行最严肃的研究”。但是，行动比语言更有份量。美国种种煽动“冷战”，加紧军事部署的行动，又怎么能同那些和平言词相协调呢？这些实际行动只能说明，美国还有着一股不小的势力，顽固地阻止国际局势缓和，反对结束“冷战”和实现裁军，并且在使用各种办法企图保持和加剧国际紧张状态。
