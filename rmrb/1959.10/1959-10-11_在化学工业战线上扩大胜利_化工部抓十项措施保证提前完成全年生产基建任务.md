　　To further consolidate and develop the current mass movement for increased production and economy in the chemical industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is focusing on ten measures. After all ten of these measures are implemented, all 216 major chemical products included in the state plan for this year will be overfulfilled ahead of schedule by five days, ten days, half a month, twenty days, and one month respectively. The fifty capital construction projects scheduled to be completed or partially completed this year will also be put into production ahead of schedule or on schedule. Among these projects are the sulfuric acid project of Sichuan Chemical Plant, Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 2, Tongguanshan Smelter, and Kaifeng Ammonia Plant, the caustic soda workshop of Zhuzhou Chemical Plant, the methanol workshop of Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, as well as the expansion project of Shanghai Solvent Plant, which is currently the largest in China, the expansion project of Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory, and the organosilicon workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant, etc.

The ten measures are:

　　(1) To further thoroughly criticize and overcome the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres, so as to better arouse the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of cadres and workers, and to carry out in depth the socialist competition with the goals of high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safe production, and to carry out the current surging mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy in a sustained and consolidated manner.

　　(2) Strengthen the specific leadership over production and capital construction. It is stipulated that leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the workshops and construction sites to help solve key problems in production or construction. Each production unit must set specific goals every month, check them on a daily and shift basis, and take timely measures to overcome weak links. Each construction unit must also formulate a project progress plan according to the established completion date; at the same time, it must do a good job in preparing for the production of the new factory, to ensure that it is put into production quickly after the project is completed.

　　(3) Vigorously carry out mass technological revolution and technological innovation movements, especially emphasizing the close combination of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers, so as to jointly break through the current technical bottlenecks and weak links in the production of sulfuric acid, fertilizers, etc.

　　(4) Thoroughly check inventory and strengthen the supply of materials needed for the great leap forward in production and capital construction. Recently, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has allocated a batch of steel from various sources to the most needed units, and is organizing cooperation between various localities and enterprises to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials.

　　(5) Cooperating with the mass movement of short-distance transportation being carried out in various places, we will seize the increase in production and transportation of chemical ores. It is required that in a short period of time, the raw materials for chemical products such as sulfuric acid, fertilizers, pesticides, and borax, which currently need a large increase in production, can maintain a certain reserve, so as to prepare conditions for stable and sustained high production in the future.

　　(6) Practice strict economy and vigorously reduce the consumption quota of various products. According to the survey, the potential for savings in various chemical enterprises is very large. If only the seventeen rubber enterprises can promote various advanced experiences affirmed at the National Rubber Technology Exchange Conference held not long ago, more than 800 tons of raw rubber can be saved this year, and these raw rubber can increase the production of 30,000 sets of car tires.

　　(7) Continue to strengthen the technical management of enterprises, strengthen the inspection system of finished products and semi-finished products, and vigorously promote the experience of improving product quality that is effective in the rubber, pharmaceutical, dye and other industries, so as to continuously improve product quality while maintaining high output.

　　(8) Strengthen the maintenance and repair of equipment so that machinery and equipment can maintain regular and safe operation.

　　(9) Rely on our own efforts to manufacture some chemical machinery and equipment. It is required that the machinery factories of various chemical enterprises should manufacture as many pipes and valves as possible, which are in great demand, to meet the needs of production and capital construction this year and next year.

　　(10) Resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs and give play to the role of "small local groups" and "small foreign groups" chemical enterprises. Within this month, the Ministry of Chemical Industry will hold technical experience exchange meetings for small sulfuric acid plants, small synthetic ammonia plants, and small soda ash plants respectively, and is helping various places to summarize the experience of producing fertilizers and pesticides by indigenous methods, so as to open up a broader road for accelerating the development of the chemical industry in the future.

### 在化学工业战线上扩大胜利  化工部抓十项措施保证提前完成全年生产基建任务

　　在化学工业战线上扩大胜利
    化工部抓十项措施保证提前完成全年生产基建任务
    新华社10日讯　为了进一步巩固与发展当前化学工业战线上的群众性的增产节约运动，化学工业部正在抓十项措施。这十项措施全部实现以后，今年列入国家计划的二百一十六项主要化工产品，都将分别提前五天、十天、半月、二十天、一个月超额完成；要求在今年建成或部分建成的五十个基本建设工程，也都将提前或按期投入生产。在这些工程中，有四川化工厂、抚顺石油二厂、铜官山冶炼厂、开封氨厂的硫酸工程，株洲化工厂的烧碱车间，太原肥料厂的甲醇车间，以及我国目前最大的上海溶剂厂的扩建工程，东北制药厂的扩建工程和沈阳化工厂的有机硅车间等。
    这十项措施是：
    （一）进一步彻底批判、克服某些干部的右倾思想，以便更好地鼓起广大干部和职工群众的革命干劲，深入开展以高产、优质、低耗和安全生产为目标的社会主义竞赛，把当前汹涌澎湃的增产节约群众运动持久巩固地开展下去。
    （二）加强对生产和基本建设的具体领导。规定各级领导干部必须深入车间和施工现场，帮助解决生产或建设中的关键问题。各生产单位要每月订出具体的奋斗目标，按日按班进行检查，及时采取措施，克服薄弱环节。各建设单位也要根据已定的竣工日期；排出工程进度计划，同时要做好新厂的生产准备工作，保证工程完成后迅速投入生产。
    （三）大力开展群众性的技术革命和技术革新运动，特别要强调领导干部、工程技术人员和工人三者的紧密结合，以便共同突破当前硫酸、化肥等生产上的技术关键和薄弱环节。
    （四）彻底清查库存，加强对生产和基本建设大跃进需要的物资供应工作。最近，化工部已经从各方面拨出一批钢材分配给最需要的单位，并且正在组织各地方、各企业之间的协作，以克服原料材料不足的困难。
    （五）配合各地正在开展的短途运输群众运动，抓紧化学矿石的增产和外运工作。要求在短时期内，使目前需要大量增产的硫酸、化肥、农药、硼砂等化工产品的原料材料，都能保持一定的储备，为今后稳定而持久的高产准备条件。
    （六）厉行节约，大力降低各种产品的消耗定额。据调查，目前各化工企业的节约潜力很大。仅是十七个橡胶企业，如能推广不久前召开的全国橡胶技术交流会议上肯定的各种先进经验，今年就可节约八百多吨生胶，这些生胶可增产三万套汽车轮胎。
    （七）继续加强企业的技术管理，加强成品和半成品的检验制度，大力推广在橡胶、医药、染料等行业中行之有效的提高产品质量的经验，做到在高产的同时，不断提高产品质量。
    （八）加强设备的维护检修工作，使机械设备能保持经常安全运转。
    （九）自力更生地制造一部分化工机械设备。要求各化工企业的机械厂，尽可能多造一些需要量极大的管路和阀门等，以适应今年和明年生产及基建的需要。
    （十）坚决贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，发挥“小土群”、“小洋群”化工企业的作用。在本月内，化工部将分别召开小型硫酸厂、小型合成氨厂和小型纯碱厂的技术经验交流会，并且正在帮助各地总结土法生产化肥和农药的经验，以便为今后加快发展化学工业开辟更广阔的道路。
