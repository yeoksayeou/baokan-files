　　Making the Best Products and Delivering Them to the Farmer Brothers as Quickly as Possible
    Beijing Sends Large Quantities of Farm Tools, Fertilizers, and Pesticides to the Countryside
    Fuzhou Rushes to Produce 150,000 Fast Reaper Blades to Support the Autumn Harvest
    (Our report) Beijing’s agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide factories are doing everything possible to support agricultural production in the suburbs. In September and October, the city has produced more than 1,000 agricultural machines and vehicles, more than 35,000 pieces of farm tools, and more than 8,000 tons of self-made and processed chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

    In response to the increased demands of the suburbs for industrial support due to the continued leap forward in agricultural production, Beijing established an Agricultural Machinery Bureau to comprehensively arrange the production of twenty-eight agricultural machinery factories. By the end of this year, the city will produce more than 8,000 various agricultural machines and vehicles for cultivation, tilling, and threshing, more than 140,000 pieces of machine-plow accessories and tractor accessories, and more than 20,000 tons of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The total output value of agricultural machinery and farm tools in the city in the fourth quarter will increase by 18% compared with the average quarterly output value of the previous three quarters.

    At present, the workers of agricultural machinery factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories throughout the city are working enthusiastically, expressing their determination to complete their tasks ahead of schedule and exceed quotas, and to deliver the best products to their farmer brothers to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, who completed the third quarter's production plan twenty days ahead of schedule, had already produced more than 760 combine harvesters from January to September this year. Recently, they are determined to complete this year's production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule, and to increase the production of more than 130 combine harvesters by the end of the year. The workers of the Chaoyang Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory are determined to complete this year's agricultural machinery production task twenty days ahead of schedule, and to successfully trial-produce large agricultural machinery such as three-five furrow plows and bulldozing shovels. After more than twenty days of experimentation, the Beijing Chemical Experiment Factory has recently preliminarily built a blast furnace with an annual output of 10,000 tons of potassium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, which will soon be officially put into production.

    In order to ensure the quality of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, all relevant departments and factories have strengthened the inspection of product quality. Now, various brand-new farm tools have begun to be continuously transported from various factories to the vast rural areas of the suburbs.

    According to the Fujian Daily, more than 10,000 workers on the industrial front in Fuzhou rushed to produce 120,000 blades, enough to assemble 60,000 fast reapers, and successively transported them to Nanping, Longyan, Fuan, and other regions to support the autumn harvest battle in the countryside.

    The fast reaper is an urgently needed autumn harvest tool. Its efficiency is about three times faster than manual rice cutting. Promoting one reaper can save 45 labor days of manual rice cutting during the autumn harvest. After full promotion, it can save six or seven million labor days in this year's autumn harvest. Therefore, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and agricultural departments requested the Fuzhou machinery departments to rush to produce the blades needed for 150,000 fast reapers before October 15. This task was undertaken by nine units, including the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute Pilot Factory, the Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory, the Fuzhou Electrical Appliance Factory, and the Fuzhou General Factory. The workers of these factories enthusiastically and energetically took on this glorious task, universally launched mass movements, and rushed to produce quickly. The entire staff of the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute Pilot Factory, which undertook the main task of producing fast reapers, formed four groups according to the manufacturing process, each responsible for and contracting to the end. Under the slogan of "people don't stop, machines don't stop," they persisted in production during the National Day holiday and completed the task of 100,000 blades one day ahead of schedule, and voluntarily added tasks to make another 50,000 blades.

　　用最快的速度制成最好的产品送给农民兄弟
    北京大批农具化肥农药下乡
    福州赶制十五万部快速收割器的刀片支援秋收
    本报讯　北京市农业机械、化学肥料、农药工厂，千方百计地支援郊区农业生产。9、10月来，全市已生产农业机械、车辆一千多台（辆），农具三万五千多件，自制和加工化学肥料、农药八千余吨。
    根据郊区农业生产继续跃进对工业部门提出更多的要求，北京市成立了农业机械局，对二十八个农业机械工厂作了全面的生产安排。今年年底全市将生产出耕作、整地、脱粒等各种农业机械和车辆八千多台（辆），机用犁配件和拖拉机配件十四万多件和化肥、农药两万多吨。第四季度全市农业机械、农具的生产总产值，将比前三个季度的平均季产值增长18％。
    目前，全市各农业机械厂、化肥厂、农药厂的职工，个个干劲冲天，纷纷表示要提前超额完成任务，以最好的产品送给农民兄弟，支援农业生产大跃进。提前二十天完成第三季度生产计划的北京农业机械厂职工，今年1至9月已经生产出七百六十多台康拜因联合收割机。最近，他们决心要提前两个半月完成今年的生产计划，到年底再增产一百三十多台康拜因联合收割机。朝阳农业机械修配厂职工，决心提前二十天完成今年的农业机械生产任务，并且要试制成功三五铧犁和推土铲等大型农业机械。北京化工实验厂经过二十多天的试验，最近初步建成了年产万吨的钾镁磷肥高炉，不久即将正式投入生产。
    为了保证农业机械、化肥、农药的质量，各有关部门和工厂都加强了产品质量的检查工作。现在，各种崭新的农具已开始从各工厂源源不断地运往郊区广大农村。
    据福建日报消息　福州市工业战线上一万多名职工，突击赶制成足以装配六万部快速收割器的刀片十二万片，陆续运往南平、龙岩、福安等专区，支援农村秋收大战。
    快速收割器是当前迫切需要的秋收工具，它的效率比人工割稻快三倍左右，推广一部收割器在秋收期间可比人工割稻节约四十五个劳动日，全面推广后，今年秋收中即可节省六、七百万个劳动日。因此，福建省委和农业部门要求福州机械部门在10月15日以前赶制好十五万部快速收割器所需要的刀片。这一任务由福建省农业机械研究所试制工厂、农械厂、福州汽车修配厂、福州电器厂、福州通用厂等九个单位承担。这些工厂的职工兴高采烈、干劲百倍地担当起这一光荣的任务，普遍开展了群众运动，快速赶制。担负生产快速收割器主要任务的福建省农业机械研究所试制厂全体职工按制造工序，分别成立四个小组，专门负责、包干到底，在“人停、机不停”的口号下，国庆节期间坚持生产，提前一天完成了十万个刀片的任务，并主动追加任务，再制五万个刀片。
