　　Not an Inch of Land Idle, Expand Wheat Sowing Area
    The Jiatan People's Commune in Luyi County, Henan Province, following the principle of "planting more and harvesting more," has been making every effort to save land, reclaim wasteland, and expand the wheat sowing area.
    In addition to reclaiming 3,129 mu of land, the commune also launched a "three-to-the-edge," "three-to-the-end," and "seven-side" expansion movement to strive to ensure that not an inch of land is left idle. The so-called "three-to-the-edge" means: ① Plowing to the edge: each of the 2,896 wheat fields in the commune plows one more furrow; calculating five furrows as one fen of land, this can expand the area by 579 mu; ② Ditch digging to the edge: each of the 1,245 large ditches in the commune plants one fen of land more, which can expand the area by 124 mu; ③ Sowing to the edge: each field is sown with one more row, with every five rows equal to one fen of land, which can expand the area by 579 mu. "Three-to-the-end" means: ① Plowing to the end: every twenty wheat fields in the commune plow one fen of land more, which can expand the planting area by 62 mu; ② Sowing to the end: every twenty fields are sown with one fen of land more, which can expand the planting area by 145 mu; ③ Digging horizontal ditches to the end: every fifty ditches are planted with one fen of land more, for a total of 62 mu. In addition, "seven-side", that is, land along roadsides, pond sides, pit sides, grave sides, river sides, well sides, and house sides, can be expanded by 1,345 mu. Including reclamation, the entire commune can save and tap land potential totaling 7,762 mu.

　　寸土不闲，扩大麦播面积
    河南鹿邑县贾滩人民公社按照“多种多收”的方针，千方百计节约土地、开垦荒地，扩大了麦播面积。
    这个公社除开荒三千一百二十九亩土地外，还掀起了“三到边”、“三到头”和“七旁”的扩种运动，争取做到寸土不闲。所谓“三到边”就是，①犁到边，全社二千八百九十六块麦地，每块多犁一犁子，按五犁子折一分地计算，可扩大五百七十九亩；②垅沟打到边，全社一千二百四十五条大垅沟，每条多种一分地，可扩大面积一百二十四亩；③耩到边，每块多耩一垅，每五垅折成一分地，可扩大面积五百七十九亩。“三到头”是：①犁到头，全社每二十块麦地多犁一分地，可扩大播种面积六十二亩；②耩到头，每二十块地多耩一分地，可扩种一百四十五亩；③横垅沟打到头，每五十条垅沟多种一分地，共可多种六十二亩。另外在“七旁”，即在路旁、塘旁、坑旁、坟旁、河旁、井旁、宅旁可扩种一千三百四十五亩。连同开荒，全公社可节约和挖出土地潜力共七千七百六十二亩。
