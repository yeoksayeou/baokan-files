　　Five Years' Work in Three Years
　　By our reporter, Jun Qiang
　　It was late summer when we traveled and visited Bulgaria. Whenever we drove along the road, the scenery on both sides always made us look around, almost overwhelmed. Vineyards and orchards stretched almost continuously. The short grape trellises were arranged neatly, stretching as far as the eye could see, with transparent bunches of grapes appearing and disappearing. The apple trees were even more eye-catching; from a distance, you might mistake them for willows because the branches were weighed down to the ground by the fruit. And the black plum trees along the roadside were laden with plums, ripe and purple, so that walking along such roads, you would feel many desires: to touch those apple trees that were unable to bear any more weight, to take a closer look at those glistening grapes, to taste the delicious plums… and even more to get to know the people who cultivated these fruit trees.
    Our wish came true. We visited the Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative not far from Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria. This is a rich land of fruits and vegetables.
    Winter-Spring of Last Year: A Great Leap Forward Clarion Call
    As the sun set, the chief agronomist of the cooperative, Mikhalkov, led us to the banks of the Maritsa River. The river reflected the evening glow, the water and sky the same color, all red. Under the weeping willows on the bank, several children had just come out of the river after swimming, and a herd of cows slowly returned from the pasture. The surroundings were quiet and beautiful. However, the chief agronomist led us here not to admire this beautiful scenery. He pointed to a large area of corn of about 900 decares (each decare equals 1.5 mu in China) and said: "Last year this was a wasteland overgrown with weeds, interspersed with many large tree roots left after logging. Last winter and spring, in the severe cold, we built a three-and-a-half-kilometer dyke, removed the tree roots, and reclaimed this land from the banks of the Maritsa River. Look how well this corn is growing! Our plan to double the income of the cooperative this year will definitely be completed!" Speaking of this, he smiled proudly.
    In the Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative, "Doubling this year's income" has become the goal to which the members are devoting all their efforts, the driving force for everyone to move forward, or rather, it has become the soul of all the cooperative's activities. And when the members talk about this, they always cannot help but mention how things were "last winter and spring." Last winter and spring was precisely the time when the Bulgarian Communist Party put forward the great call to complete the five-year plan for agriculture in three years, a call that shook the Balkans from north to south like a spring thunder. The Ivanovo cooperative was also inspired by this spring thunder and made many changes, strengthening the pace of progress. Last winter, four small cooperatives from four villages merged into the current large cooperative, and a new cooperative chairman was elected. This new chairman, Comrade Shikov, could immediately be seen as a shrewd and capable head of household. He was also transferred from the county in response to the Party's call last winter; he was originally the deputy chairman of the county People's Committee. Talking about this new job, Comrade Shikov said with a smile that in the past, he mainly sat in the office attending meetings and making phone calls in the county. Now that he has come to the front, he has to do everything himself, which is not so easy! As he spoke, he invited the chief agronomist and animal husbandry specialist to accompany us to visit the family business he led.
    Large Family Business, Doubled Income
    The Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative is a large and prosperous fruit and vegetable land. The following numbers are very eloquent. The cooperative has 68,000 decares of land, of which one-third is used for growing grains and feed crops, 6,000 decares of orchards, mostly apples, 4,600 decares of vineyards, 6,000 decares of vegetable gardens, mainly tomatoes. There are 2,000 decares of strawberries, as well as tobacco, hemp, watermelon, and so on. Not to mention herds of cattle and sheep, nearly 400 dairy cows, more than 7,000 sheep, more than 3,000 pigs, and more than 30,000 chickens. In addition, there are 40 tractors, 23 cars....
    Like other parts of Bulgaria, this cooperative cultivates three types of tomatoes, namely early-maturing, mid-early-maturing, and late-maturing tomatoes. The host first took us to see the newly matured mid-early-maturing tomatoes. Then he took us to see the vineyards, orchards, cowsheds, pigsties, chicken coops, etc. As we visited, we enjoyed the grapes, plums, and tomatoes picked by the host, and the enthusiastic host regretted that we could not taste the apples because we came early. However, the host focused on showing us the cooperative's water conservancy construction. This is a product of the Great Leap Forward last winter and spring. Like the newly reclaimed wasteland on the banks of the Maritsa River, it is a symbol of the members' great leap forward in production, and the pride of the cooperative.
    The irrigation canal of the newly completed Batak water conservancy hub passes by this cooperative. From far away, we could hear the sound of the engine, which is one of the two newly built pumping stations of the cooperative. The power is supplied by an old steam engine. As soon as we saw the shadow of the pumping machine from a distance, a whistle sounded there, it turned out that the member in charge of the machine specifically sounded the whistle to welcome Chinese friends. The water pumped out by the pumping machine flows into the fields and orchards along the winding new canals. Comrade Shikov, chairman of the cooperative, said: "Last winter and spring, in the past two months of winter leisure, our cooperative newly dug 71 kilometers of canals, plus more than 30 newly drilled wells, the irrigated area suddenly increased by more than 20,000 decares. The land will not let the water down, this is the guarantee of doubling the income of our cooperative this year."
    The Ivanovo cooperative is an old cooperative. Two of the four cooperatives before the merger were established in 1945. After the merger last winter, it coincided with the Bulgarian Party issuing a call to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule. The members then tried their best to carefully calculate, and after considering it again and again, they decided to increase the income of 43 million leva last year to 86 million, exactly double. Although the manpower and financial resources have been stronger than before after the merger, it is not so simple to double the income in one year. They decided to reclaim wasteland, greatly repair water conservancy, and accumulate fertilizer, while adjusting the planting area and expanding the area of crops with high yields. For example, they expanded the famous early-maturing tomatoes in this area from the original 1,000 decares to 2,100 decares. Everything must be done bit by bit, and there should be no delay, it must be done as soon as it is said. Although it was the severe winter season, the Great Leap Forward began.
    Winter Work, Early-Maturing Tomatoes
    As the saying goes, everything is difficult at the beginning. Comrade Tobanov, secretary of the Party branch of Mallo-Konare village in the cooperative, told us that in those freezing days of reclaiming wasteland and digging canals, difficulties were also encountered at first. The main thing was to mobilize female members to work. It was not that the female members were not active in the Great Leap Forward, but they were not used to working in the fields in winter in the past, and it was difficult to change that for a while. The Party group leader Gasheva and two other female Party members took the lead and worked with the men. Other women saw that women were working the same way in sub-zero weather, and gradually came out with shovels. Among them, not only did all the female members of the Tonyeva group participate in digging canals, but also completed the task ahead of schedule. In this way, under the mobilization and leadership of the Party, with the help of machines, the members of the Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative, in addition to digging 71 kilometers of canals, also reclaimed more than 1,900 decares of wasteland, some of which were terraces. Coupled with more than 30 drilled wells, the cooperative's irrigated area was expanded from 23,000 decares to 46,000, another doubling!
    The members of the Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative spent the two months of winter in heroic labor, in the sound of the Great Leap Forward.
    Reclaiming wasteland and digging canals is the beginning of the Great Leap Forward. Land with water still needs careful cultivation and nurturing. The members deeply understand this. When we visited, the apple orchard had been sprayed eight times and watered four times. Comrade Shikov, chairman of the cooperative, told us that through fertilization, irrigation, and intertillage, the cooperative has gradually reduced the difference in the annual harvest of apples, that is to say, gradually let the so-called large and small years of apples no longer play a role. Take tomatoes as an example. Bulgarian tomatoes occupy a major position in exported vegetables. The main ones used for export and the biggest income are early-maturing tomatoes, which can compete with France and Italy in the international market. Because everyone knows that the price of tomatoes is high when they first come on the market in early summer, and the earlier the tomatoes mature, the more income can be earned. Take the youth group led by the Communist Youth League member Mishov as an example. These young people were assigned to be responsible for the tomato fields this year, and it was still a barren land. But they were not afraid of the new task and did not worry about the thin land. Despite the cold and hot weather this spring, they were the first to cultivate the seedlings. Mishov led a dozen young people, rising early and sleeping late, working hard. They applied fertilizer more diligently than other groups, and it goes without saying that they applied enough fertilizer. They also broke the Bulgarian habit of not applying farm manure, and unprecedentedly accumulated five tons of farm manure per decare. As a result, the tomatoes in their group matured the earliest in the cooperative and grew large and well. In this way, each decare earned 7,500 leva, double the quota. The group was therefore rated as the first place among the youth groups in the cooperative and received a bonus of 1,000 leva.
    Unfortunately, we did not see Mishov and his group. We came to the cooperative on Sunday, and the cooperative's football team went to the city to participate in the state championship. Everyone in the cooperative who could spare the time went to the city to cheer for the football team. Comrade Tobanov, secretary of the Party branch of Mallo-Konare village, was taken away by a group of young people after accompanying us to visit the vineyard and went to the city to watch the game. Speaking of the football game, the chairman of the cooperative took us to see a stadium that the cooperative was building itself, which could accommodate 7,000 spectators. The stands, the track, and the football field covered with green grass were truly quite large!
    The Karlovo-Ivanovo cooperative is one of the 975 cooperatives in Bulgaria. This year, the 975 cooperatives announced like one person: doubling income, doing five years of work in three years, and completing the five-year plan in three years. Whether it is the "Oriental Red" cooperative near Sofia or the "Road to Communism" cooperative near the ancient city of Tarnovo in the northern Balkan Mountains, they are all of one heart with the Ivanovo cooperative and are working hard with full confidence to increase production by one time this year. The farmers of Dimitrov's motherland are in a Great Leap Forward! (Attached picture)

　　五年的事三年办
　　本报记者　君强
    正是夏末时节，我们在保加利亚旅行访问，每当乘汽车沿公路行驶时，路旁的景色总是把我们引得左顾右盼，应接不暇。那葡萄园和果园几乎一个接着一个。矮矮的葡萄架排得整整齐齐，一望无际，透明的大串葡萄时隐时现。苹果树更惹人注目，远看你简直会把它们误认为杨柳，因为树枝被果子压得都垂到地上来了。而公路两旁的黑李子树上，一束束的李子已经熟得紫里透亮，走在这样的路上，你会产生很多欲望：想去抚摸一下那不胜负荷的苹果树，想仔细看看那亮晶晶的葡萄，想尝尝鲜美的李子……更想认识一下培植这些果树的人们。
    我们的愿望实现了，我们访问了保加利亚南方距普罗夫迪夫市不远的卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社，这是个富饶的水果和蔬菜之乡。
    去冬今春　跃进号角
    夕阳西下的时候，合作社总农艺师米哈尔科夫领我们来到马里查河边。河水映着晚霞，水天一色，都是红的，岸边垂柳下几个孩子刚从河里游泳上来，一群奶牛慢悠悠地从牧场回来。四周宁静而美丽。不过，总农艺师领我们到这儿来，却不是要我们来欣赏这优美的景色，他指着岸边那一大片达九百狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合我国一市亩半）的玉米地说：“去年这儿还是一片荒草，中间夹杂着许多伐后剩下的大树根。在去冬今春的严寒时节，我们筑了三公里半的堤，拔掉了树根，从马里查河滩上夺出了这块地。你们看，这玉米长得多么好！我们社今年收入增加一倍的计划一定能够完成！”说到这里，他自豪地笑了笑。
    在卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社，“让今年的收入翻一番”，已经成为社员们全力以赴的目标，成为大家前进的动力，或者说，已成为合作社一切活动的灵魂了。而社员们谈起这件事时，却总又离不开“去冬今春”曾如何如何。去冬今春，正是保加利亚共产党提出用三年时间提前完成农业方面的五年计划的伟大号召的时候，这个号召像春雷一样震动了巴尔干山南北。伊万诺夫合作社也在这声春雷的激动下有了许多变化，加强了前进的步伐。去冬由四个村子的四个小社并成了现在的这个大社，选举了新的社主席。而这位新主席什科夫同志一眼就看得出是个精明强干的好当家人，他也是去冬响应党的号召从县里下放来的，他原是县人民委员会副主席。谈到这新的工作时，什科夫同志笑着说，过去在县里主要是坐在办公室开会、打电话，现在来到了前方，一切都要亲自干，不那么容易呀！他一边说着，一边邀了总农艺师和饲畜师陪我们去参观他领导的家业。
    家大业大　收入加倍
    卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社是个家大业大的水果蔬菜之乡。下面这几个数字是非常雄辩的。合作社有六万八千狄卡尔土地，除三分之一种谷物和饲料作物外，有六千狄卡尔果园，苹果最多，四千六百狄卡尔葡萄园，六千狄卡尔菜园，主要是番茄。有二千狄卡尔的草莓，还有烟、麻、西瓜等等。牛羊成群更不用说了，奶牛近四百头，羊七千多只，猪三千多头，鸡三万多只。此外，拖拉机有四十台，汽车二十三部……。
    这个社同保加利亚其他地方一样，培育有三种番茄，即早熟、中早熟和晚熟番茄。主人带我们先看了刚刚成熟的中早熟番茄。然后带我们看葡萄园、果园、牛棚、猪圈、鸡舍等等。我们一边参观，一边尽情享受着主人摘来的葡萄、李子和番茄，热情的主人却还因为我们来的时间早，不能尝到苹果而惋惜。但是，主人着重让我们看的还是合作社的水利建设。这是去冬今春的跃进产物。同马里查河畔新垦的荒地一样，是社员们生产大跃进的标记，是合作社的骄傲。
    新落成的巴塔克水利枢纽的灌溉干渠从这个合作社旁经过。离干渠老远就听得见发动机的响声，这是合作社最近新建的两个抽水站之一。用作动力的是一个旧蒸汽机。我们刚远远地看见抽水机的影子，那儿就鸣起了汽笛，原来是管机器的社员特地鸣笛欢迎中国朋友的。抽水机抽出来的水，顺着曲曲弯弯的新渠道流到田地和果园中去。合作社主席什科夫同志说：“去冬今春，在过去是冬闲的两个月内，我们社新挖了七十一公里渠道，加上新打的三十多口井，灌溉面积一下子增加了两万多狄卡尔。土地是不会辜负水的，这是今年我们社收入增加一倍的保证。”
    伊万诺夫合作社是个老社。合并之前的四个社中两个是1945年成立的。去冬合并后，正赶上保加利亚党发出提前完成五年计划的号召。社员们于是想尽一切办法精打细算，考虑来考虑去，结果决定把去年四千三百万列弗的收入提高到八千六百万，不多不少整整增加一倍。并社后虽然人力财力都较前雄厚了，但是一年之间使收入翻一番也不那么简单。他们决定开荒、大修水利、积肥，同时调整播种面积，把收益多的作物面积扩大。例如，他们把这一带有名的早熟番茄从原有的一千狄卡尔扩大到二千一百狄卡尔。一切都要一点一滴地作，而且事不宜迟，必须说干就干。虽然正是严冬季节，大跃进开始了。
    冬季出工　番茄早熟
    俗语说得好，万事开头难。社里的马洛·科纳列村党支部书记托巴诺夫告诉我们说，在那天寒地冻的日子开荒挖渠，最初也遇到了困难。主要是动员女社员出工。女社员并不是对大跃进不积极，只是过去没有冬天在地里干活的习惯，一时扭转不过来。党的小组长加舍娃和另外两个女党员带头和男人们一道干了起来，其他妇女看到女人在零下的天气也一样干，才逐渐扛起铁锹出来了。其中托涅娃小组不但全组女社员都参加了挖渠，而且提前完成了任务。就这样，在党的动员和领导下，卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社的社员们在机器的帮助下，除挖了七十一公里渠道外，还开了一千九百多狄卡尔的荒地，其中一部分是梯田。加上打的三十多口井，把社的灌溉面积从二万三千狄卡尔扩大到四万六千，又是一倍！
    卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社的社员们就这样在英勇的劳动中，在跃进声中度过了冬季的两个月。
    开荒挖渠是大跃进的开端。土地有了水还需要精心的耕作和培育。社员们深深懂得这一点。当我们访问的时候，苹果园已经喷过八次药、浇过四遍水了。社主席什科夫同志告诉我们，社里通过施肥、灌溉和中耕，已逐渐缩小了苹果每年收获量的差别，就是说，逐渐让苹果的所谓大、小年不再起作用。再拿番茄来说吧。保加利亚的番茄占出口蔬菜的主要地位。用来出口和收益最大的主要是早熟番茄，它在国际市场上可以同法国、意大利竞争。因为大家知道，初夏番茄刚上市的价格是高的，番茄早熟一天就可以收入更多些。就拿共青团员米什夫领导的青年小组为例吧。这些青年是今年才被分配负责番茄地的，而且那还是块薄地。可是他们不怕新任务也不担心地薄，仅管今春气候忽冷忽热，他们还是最早把苗儿育出来了。米什夫带领着十几个青年人，早起晚睡，勤劳苦干。打尖时比别的组打的勤，肥料上的足自不必说，还打破保加利亚不施厩肥的习惯，破天荒为每狄卡尔积了五吨厩肥。结果，他们组的番茄在社内熟的最早，长的又大又好。这样，每一狄卡尔收入了七千五百列弗，比定额高出一倍。小组因此被评为社内青年组中的第一名，得了一千列弗奖金。
    可惜，我们没有看见米什夫和他的小组。我们来到合作社正是星期天，合作社的足球队到城内参加全州冠军赛去了。社里凡是能抽出身来的人都为足球队助兴去了。马洛·科纳列村党支部书记托巴洛夫陪着我们参观了葡萄园后就被一群青年人拉走，到城里看球去了。提起足球赛，社主席又领我们去看了合作社自己正在建筑的一个可容七千观众的体育场。那看台、跑道和铺着绿草的足球场，真是颇具规模呢！
    卡拉依·伊万诺夫合作社是保加利亚九百七十五个合作社中的一个。今年，九百七十五个社像一个人一样宣布：把收入翻一番，五年的事三年办，一定要在三年内完成五年计划。我们访问过的索非亚附近的“东方红”合作社也好，巴尔干山北部梯尔诺沃古城附近的“走向共产主义之路”合作社也好，都同伊万诺夫合作社是一条心，也正在信心百倍地为今年增产一倍而奋战。季米特洛夫祖国的农民正在大跃进啊！（附图片）
　　这是伊万诺夫合作社的苹果园，看，累累的果实把枝条都压下来了。
