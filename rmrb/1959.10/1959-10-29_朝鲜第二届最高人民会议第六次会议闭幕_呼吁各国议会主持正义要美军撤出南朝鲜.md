Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th. The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea closed this morning.

This morning's session continued the discussion of the second item on the agenda – the issue of reorganizing the people's education system. All deputies unanimously approved the report on this issue made by Li Il-kyeong, Minister of Education and Culture and deputy, and passed the decree of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly on reorganizing the people's education system.

At today's meeting, the decrees issued by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly since the last Supreme People's Assembly were also approved.

At today's meeting, Ko Chun-taek was removed from the post of Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and Kang Ryang-uk was elected as Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and Pak Mun-gyu as Secretary-General. In addition, members of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly were re-elected.

At today's meeting, Heo Jeong-suk was elected as President of the Supreme Court, and Kim Ha-eun was removed from the post of President of the Supreme Court.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 27th. The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unanimously passed a letter in the name of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea to the parliaments of all countries of the world regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea. The full text is as follows: To the Members of Parliaments of All Countries in the World:

The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based on its consistent desire to end the suffering of the long-term national division and to realize the reunification of Korea as soon as possible, and recognizing that the issue of eliminating the threat of war and maintaining and consolidating peace in Korea is an urgent issue inseparable from the cause of world peace, sends this letter to the parliaments of all countries of the world.

Korea has been trapped in the tragic fate of national division for more than fourteen years.

More than six years have passed since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which created new possibilities for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but reunification has still not been achieved.

The continuation of the division continues to bring increasingly heavy and incalculable misfortune and suffering to our entire country and society, and even to every family.

Due to the continuation of the division, the tense situation in Korea, which threatens world peace, especially Asian peace, has not been eliminated, and the root of war, which breeds seeds of serious disaster, is growing day by day.

There has never been any reason why our nation should be divided into North and South. Since ancient times, our people have lived harmoniously on this peninsula as a single nation inheriting the blood of the same ancestor, as brothers of the same family. This single nation with a long tradition has been artificially divided, making it impossible for us to utilize the rich natural resources and economic potential of the North and South of our country in a unified manner, and also making it impossible to prosper our national culture in a unified manner.

In the fourteen years that our country has been divided, South Korea has completely become a market for dumping foreign surplus commodities, losing its independence. The national industry has gone bankrupt across the board, the total industrial output value has decreased to about half of what it was before liberation, the countryside is desolate, and South Korea, which used to export grain, has become a region of chronic famine. Political chaos is extreme, hunger, poverty and moral degradation have also spread throughout South Korea, and millions of unemployed people and begging children wander the streets.

In the northern half, where political power is in the hands of the Korean people themselves, despite the difficult environment of the country being divided into two parts, it has rapidly transformed from a backward colonial agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country with a solid foundation for an independent national economy in a short period of time.

Today, the northern half, which has embarked on the road of an independent country, has entered a period of brilliant prosperity in the lives of the people, unprecedented in our country's history.

However, due to the division of the country, the people of the northern half cannot share the fruits of their creative labor with their suffering brothers in the southern half. Due to the division of the country, even dear parents, wives, brothers, sisters, relatives and friends who are separated in the North and South are unable to meet or exchange letters.

We believe that all who love justice and truth will agree that this abnormal state in Korea caused by the division of the country should not continue.

Today, the armistice situation in Korea is in a state of constant tension and instability, contrary to the hopes of the people of the world when the sound of gunfire had just stopped.

Many clauses of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which was signed at the cost of the blood of the Korean people and the persistent efforts of peace-loving forces around the world, have been unilaterally abrogated by the US side.

The Rhee Syngman army had sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice, and now it has been expanded to thirty-one divisions. The personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission inspection teams, who were responsible for supervising and ensuring the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, have long been driven out of South Korea.

In South Korea, a large number of destructive weapons - atomic weapons and missiles - have been shipped in from the United States.

Rhee Syngman is still clamoring for a "northward advance," and the US military and the Rhee Syngman army are frequently conducting atomic maneuvers near the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, constantly creating provocative acts of invasion against North Korean territory.

We believe that no one can deny the fact that the escalating tension in Korea is seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. If this dark cloud is not eliminated, the people of the world can never rest easy.

For the sake of peace in Korea, and for the sake of peace in the Far East and the world, the Korean issue must be resolved as soon as possible, and the root of a new war in Korea must be eradicated as soon as possible.

The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, out of its obligation to the fate of its own nation, and out of the interests of world peace, solemnly declares to the world once again: The end of the artificial division of Korea and the eradication of the root of a new war can only be achieved through peaceful means.

As is well known, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently put forward a reasonable and just plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea before the outbreak of the Korean War.

However, the United States and the Rhee Syngman authorities responded to our peaceful proposal by provoking war.

These two diametrically opposed paths of peace and war for resolving the Korean issue have continued to this day after the armistice.

After the signing of the armistice agreement, in order to lead the armistice to a consolidated peace and create favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we once suggested that North and South Korea reduce their armed forces to a minimum, and that the North and South Korean authorities declare that they would not take any military action. At the same time, we unilaterally reduced 80,000 troops, setting an example in practical action.

We also suggested that after all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, free elections should be held throughout Korea on a democratic basis to peacefully achieve the reunification of the motherland.

In accordance with our proposal, the Chinese People's Volunteers had already taken the initiative to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of October 1958.

In order to promote the realization of the peaceful reunification plan of the motherland, and in order to eliminate the wall of distrust that stands in the way of North and South Korea, we once suggested that extensive economic and cultural exchanges should be carried out between North and South Korea, that postal services and the free movement of peaceful residents should be realized, and that consultations should be held between North and South Korea to discuss all these issues.

However, none of our just and reasonable peaceful reunification plans has been realized due to the complete rejection of the United States and the Rhee Syngman authorities.

It has been more than a year since the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea, but the US military continues to remain in South Korea. The continued division of Korea and the continued threat of war in Korea are all rooted in the continued presence of US troops in South Korea.

It is obvious that the resolution of the Korean issue, if not by the so-called "policy of strength," but by truly peaceful means, must begin with the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

The resolution of the Korean issue must not be placed on two parallel lines of peace and war that can never be united.

The method of war can never be a way to resolve the Korean issue, nor can it open up a way out for anyone, as the experience of the Korean War has clearly shown.

If one does not want to suppress the Korean people by force, and does not want to impose anything on the Korean people, then no one will oppose the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea.

The US military no longer has any basis to continue to remain in South Korea. It is our unwavering desire to peacefully reunify our country ourselves. We have consistently maintained, and continue to maintain, that no external forces should be allowed to interfere in the resolution of our own problems.

We have sufficient capacity and all the conditions to solve our own problems ourselves.

We want to realize the reunification of our country after all foreign troops withdraw from South Korea, based on the unanimous will of the 30 million Korean people, on a democratic basis, through free general elections including the North and South.

However, because the United States has stolen the lofty name of the United Nations and made it a belligerent party in the Korean War, the United Nations has long since lost its qualifications to even talk about "supervising" this election. The United Nations now needs to pay attention to this. The United Nations should restore its authority as a peace organization and discuss the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops, led by the US military, from South Korea. The Americans must abandon the absurd claim that the 38th parallel of Korea, thousands of miles away from US territory, is the US "defense line."

Members of Parliaments of All Countries in the World!

All peace-loving people of the world!

The current situation urgently requires the resolution of the Korean issue. For the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the primary issue under the current conditions is: the withdrawal of all foreign troops, led by the US military, from South Korea. If foreign troops withdraw from South Korea, then all the crux of the Korean issue will begin to be unraveled.

We believe that our peace-loving national desire - to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea without the interference of foreign troops - will surely be supported by peace-loving people all over the world.

In order to prevent the tragedy of the Korean War, which endangered the world by dragging it into a new world war, from happening again on this land, we hope that the parliaments of all countries around the world, representing the will of their people, should support our peaceful reunification plan and demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

We also hope that the parliaments of all countries that have sent troops to South Korea will discuss the issue of withdrawing their own troops and demand that their governments immediately withdraw their troops from South Korea.

Today, in the entire international life, the ice of the "Cold War" has begun to melt, and a new trend of solving disputes through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to force and coercion is surging.

The withdrawal of US troops from South Korea is in line with the international trend and is in line with the spirit of comprehensive and thorough disarmament that has matured.

The roots of tension and conflict should be eradicated in all parts of the world.

Today, supporting our just proposals for consolidating peace in Korea and for peacefully resolving the Korean issue is a noble action taken for the vital interests of the people of all countries.

Peace is the common great cause of the people of the world!

Korea should belong to the Korean people!

All foreign troops withdraw from South Korea!

For the sake of peace and the security of the people, we appeal to the parliaments and political figures of all countries in the world, including the United States, and to all peace-loving people: actively support our national aspiration.

The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
October 27, 1959, Pyongyang

   朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第六次会议闭幕
    呼吁各国议会主持正义要美军撤出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤28日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天上午闭幕。
    今天上午会议继续讨论了第二项议程——改组人民教育体制的问题。全体议员最后一致同意了教育文化相、议员李一卿就此问题所作的报告，并通过了最高人民会议常任委员会关于改组人民教育体制的法令。
    在今天的会议上还批准了自上次最高人民会议到本次会议期间内最高人民会议常任委员会发布的法令。
    在今天的会议上，免去了高峻泽的最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长的职务，选出康良煜为最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长，朴文圭为书记长。另外还补选了最高人民会议常任委员会委员。
    在今天的会议上，选出许贞琡为最高裁判所所长，免去了金夏云的最高裁判所所长的职务。
    新华社平壤27日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天上午一致通过了以朝鲜最高人民会议的名义就朝鲜的和平统一问题给世界各国议会的信。全文如下：世界各国议会议员们：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议从解除长久的民族分裂的痛苦，早日实现朝鲜的统一的一贯愿望出发，并根据在朝鲜消除战争威胁、维护和巩固和平问题是同世界和平事业不可分割的迫切问题之一这一认识，向世界各国议会发出这一封信。
    朝鲜陷入民族分裂的悲惨命运已经十四年多了。
    为朝鲜问题的和平解决造成了新的可能性的朝鲜停战协定的签订到今天已经过了六年多，但是统一仍然没有实现。
    分裂局面的持续，给我们整个国家和社会以至每个人的家庭，继续带来愈益加重的不可估量的不幸和痛苦。
    由于分裂局面的持续，威胁着世界和平特别是威胁着亚洲和平的朝鲜紧张局势还没有消除，而且孕育着严重灾祸种子的战争祸根正在日益成长。
    从来没有任何理由我国民族要被分裂为南北两部分。自古以来，我国人民一直作为继承同一祖先血统的单一民族，作为同一家庭的兄弟在这个半岛过着和睦的生活。这个具有悠久传统的单一民族被人为地分裂，使我们不可能统一地利用我国南北部丰富的自然资源和经济潜力，也不可能统一地繁荣我国的民族文化。
    在我们祖国被分裂的十四年中，南朝鲜完全沦为丧失了独立的、外国剩余商品的倾销市场。民族工业全面破产，工业总产值约减少到解放前的一半，农村荒芜不堪，往日出口粮食的南朝鲜变成慢性饥馑地区。政治上极度混乱，饥饿、贫穷和道德堕落也蔓延南朝鲜全境，数百万失业者和乞食儿童彷徨在街头。
    政权被掌握在朝鲜人民自己手中的北半部，虽然处于国土被分裂为两部分的困难环境中，但在短暂的时间内，却已经由落后的殖民地农业国家迅速转变为具有巩固的独立民族经济基础的工业—农业国家。
    今天走上了独立国家道路的北半部，人民生活进入了我国历史上从未有过的灿烂繁荣时期。
    但是，由于国土的被分裂，北半部人民不能同遭受痛苦的南半部兄弟共享自己用创造性劳动取得的幸福果实。由于国土的被分裂，甚至分居在南北半部音信断绝的亲爱的父母妻子、兄弟姊妹、亲戚朋友既不能相会，也不能互通书信。
    我们相信：凡是一切热爱正义和真理的人都会一致认为，因国土被分裂而造成的朝鲜这种不正常状态不应当再继续下去。
    今天朝鲜的停战局面和在炮火刚停止时全世界人民所抱的希望相反，处于不断紧张和不安定的状态。
    由于朝鲜人民付出了血的代价和全世界爱好和平的力量作出了坚持不懈的努力而签订的朝鲜停战协定，它的许多条款已被美方片面废除。
    李承晚军队在刚停战时有十六个师，现在已扩大到三十一个师。负责监督和保证朝鲜停战协定得以履行的中立国监察委员会视察小组人员早已被从南朝鲜赶走。
    在南朝鲜，从美国运进了大批毁灭性武器——原子武器和导弹。
    李承晚至今还在大肆叫嚣“北进”，美军和李承晚军队还在军事分界线和非军事区附近频繁地进行原子机动演习，对北朝鲜地区不断地制造挑衅性的侵犯行为。
    我们认为，任何人也不会否认在朝鲜的加剧的紧张局势正严重地威胁着远东和世界和平这个事实。假如不消除这块乌云，那么全世界人民绝不能高枕无忧。
    为了朝鲜的和平，为了远东和世界的和平，朝鲜问题必须早日解决，朝鲜的新战争根源必须早日铲除。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议从对自己民族命运的义务出发，以及从世界和平的利益出发，再次严肃地向全世界宣告：朝鲜的被人为分裂局面的终结和新战争祸根的铲除，只有经过和平途径才有可能实现。
    如所周知，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在朝鲜战争爆发以前，始终一贯地提出了和平统一朝鲜的合理而公正的方案。
    但是，美国和李承晚当局却以挑起战争来回答我们的这个和平建议。
    解决朝鲜问题的和平和战争这两条截然相反的路线，一直延长到停战后的今天。
    停战协定签订后，我们为了使停战导向巩固的和平，创造和平解决朝鲜问题的有利条件，曾经建议南北朝鲜把武装力量裁减到最少限度，由南北朝鲜当局宣布不采取一切武力行为，同时，我们单方面裁减了八万名兵力，以实际行动对此作出了榜样。
    我们还建议，在一切外国军队撤出朝鲜后，在民主的基础上举行全朝鲜的自由选举，和平实现祖国的统一。
    根据我们的建议，中国人民志愿军在1958年10月底，已经主动地全部撤离了朝鲜。
    为了促进祖国和平统一方案的实现，为了消除横阻在南北朝鲜的不信任的障碍墙壁，我们曾经建议广泛地进行南北朝鲜的经济和文化的交流，实现通邮和和平居民的自由来往，并且建议为了讨论这一切问题，由南北朝鲜之间进行协商。
    但是，我们的这些公正合理的和平统一方案，由于美国和李承晚当局的完全拒绝，没有一项能够得到实现。
    中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜已经一年多了，可是美军还继续留驻在南朝鲜。朝鲜继续分裂和在朝鲜继续产生战争威胁，所有这一切，其根源都在于美军继续驻扎在南朝鲜。
    朝鲜问题的解决，如果不是用所谓“实力政策”，而是用真正和平方法的话，那么首先要从一切外国军队撤出朝鲜开始，这是十分明显的事实。
    朝鲜问题的解决，决不能放置在永远不能合而为一的和平和战争这样两条平行线上面。
    战争的方法决不能成为解决朝鲜问题的途径，这也不能给任何人打开出路，过去朝鲜战争的经历清楚地说明了这一点。
    假如不想用暴力压制朝鲜人民，不想把任何东西强加于朝鲜人民头上的话，那么任何人都不会反对一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜。
    美军现在再没有任何根据继续留驻在南朝鲜了。由我们自己来和平统一我们的国土——这是我们始终不渝的愿望。我们一贯主张，并继续主张：对于我们自己问题的解决，不许有任何外部势力的干涉。
    我们有足够的能力和一切条件，由我们自己来解决自己的问题。
    我们要在一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜以后根据三千万朝鲜人民的一致意志，在民主的基础上，通过自由的包括南北部的普选来实现我国的统一。
    但是，由于美国盗用了联合国的崇高名义使它成了朝鲜战争的交战一方，联合国就连谈论“监督”这个选举的资格都早已丧失了。联合国现在正需要注意这一点。联合国应该恢复它作为和平机构的权威，讨论有关以美军为首的一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜的问题。美国人必须放弃把远离美国领土数千英里的朝鲜三八线说成是美国“防御线”的荒唐无稽的主张。
    世界各国议会议员们！
    世界一切爱好和平的人民！
    目前形势迫切要求朝鲜问题的解决。为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，在目前条件下首要的问题是：以美军为首的一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜。如果外国军队撤出南朝鲜，那么解决朝鲜问题的一切症结都将开始解开。
    我们相信：我们爱好和平的全民族的愿望——在没有外国军队的干涉下实现朝鲜的和平统一，必将受到全世界尊重和平的人们的支持。
    为了在这块土地上不再重演使世界卷入新的世界战争危险的朝鲜战争的惨祸，我们希望全世界各国议会代表本国人民的意志，应当支持我们的和平统一方案，要求美军撤出南朝鲜。
    我们还希望所有向南朝鲜派遣军队的国家的议会，讨论撤回自己军队的问题，要求本国政府从南朝鲜立即撤回自己的军队。
    今天，在整个国际生活中，“冷战”的冰块已经开始融化，不用诉诸武力和强迫的方法而用和平谈判的方法来解决纠纷问题的新潮流，正在滚滚奔流。
    美军撤出南朝鲜，是符合国际潮流的，是符合已经成熟的全面彻底裁军的精神的。
    应该在全世界所有的地方铲除造成紧张局势和冲突的根源。
    今天，支持我们巩固朝鲜和平以及和平解决朝鲜问题的正义建议，就是为了所有国家人民的血肉相关的利益而采取的崇高行动。
    和平是世界人民的共同的伟大事业！
    朝鲜应该属于朝鲜人民！
    一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜！
    为了和平和人民的安全，我们向包括美国在内的全世界一切国家的议会和政治活动家以及全体爱好和平人民呼吁：积极支持我们的这一民族愿望。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议
