The benefits of the People's Commune are endless. Today, let's not talk about anything else, but only about the kindergarten of the Nan Zhangfeng Production Brigade of the Suicheng People's Commune in Xushui County.

	Breaking Through Difficulties

In the early winter of 1958, the kindergarten had just been established for three months, with a total of ninety-two children, all full-time. Within one day, six children developed high fevers, and the situation was very severe. The head of the kindergarten, Wang Guizhi, was so worried that she couldn't eat. She hurriedly cleaned up an isolation room in the small hospital and sent Li Shuhua, the most conscientious and patient, to take care of the sick children.

Every time Secretary Chen of the commune party committee asked the village branch secretaries to report, he first asked about the kindergarten's situation, from the illness, treatment, food, clothing, and shelter, all the way to how many songs they had learned, whether they were polite, showing real and meticulous concern. Zhang Kerong, the village branch secretary, said to all the nannies: "This is the first year we are running the kindergarten. Whether we can consolidate it depends on this illness." After speaking, he immediately brought the best rice and flour to the sick children, and personally went to Beijing and Baoding to buy white sugar and fruit. He repeatedly told the doctor: "We must cure every child's illness. We are running the commune and making the Great Leap Forward entirely for them." He went to the ward four or five times a day, and even went once in the middle of the night, patiently patting the crying children to sleep. He said to Li Shuhua: "You must show a high degree of communist spirit and treat these children as your closest relatives. Don't be careless at all. Whatever you need, just say it, and we will try our best to solve it."

Li Shuhua was moved by the words of the branch secretary and felt the burden was indeed heavy. She was twenty-three years old. Although she had been married for several years, she had no children and had never taken care of sick children. Taking care of these sick children in front of her was indeed not an easy task. She boiled six doses of traditional Chinese medicine for them every day. For those who wouldn't eat, she dripped water into their mouths drop by drop. If one wet the bed, and another soiled the quilt, she immediately cleaned it up very cleanly, leaving no unpleasant smell. Someone said:
"Shuhua, you are usually such a clean and neat person. Can you stand grabbing poop all day long?" She said: "I only want the children to get better, and I can't smell any bad smell." A girl named Xiaojing had a high fever, and Li Shuhua held her for three days and three nights. Her arms ached so much that she couldn't stretch them for half a month. One day, her mother-in-law ran to her and said: "Don't do this. What will you do if something happens to the children?" These words made Li Shuhua feel very scared. She wanted to ask the head of the kindergarten to replace her, but she suddenly realized something. She said to her mother-in-law: "Mom! Don't worry. I will do my best to take care of these children. If I leave them at this time, I will feel uncomfortable."

After her careful care, all fourteen sick children recovered in a month. Xiaojing's mother, Li Aiqin, said: "If this child hadn't been in the kindergarten, she would have died long ago. I and my child will never forget this kindergarten in our lifetime." Wang Laoqi's family had six children. The mother's legs were disabled, and there was only one labor force. Every year, they were a grain-deficient household. This time, her two children in the kindergarten developed measles and pneumonia. When the children returned home for the first time after recovering, she touched their heads and said: "If it weren't for the People's Commune, if it weren't for the kindergarten, the sun would have never shone on your heads again." Hearing these words, Li Shuhua cried. She thought: Kindergarten! You have finally overcome difficulties for the first time.

	Good Cafeteria

The seven elderly people in the home for the elderly and the children are in the same cafeteria. Once, an inspection team came and said: "This is the best cafeteria. Even the county doesn't eat as many varieties as they do." The leaders of the brigade gave them the best grain to eat. The milk from two big dairy cows was used to make dry food for them. In the experimental field, a piece of land was specially planted for them to grow vegetables. They couldn't finish eating every day, and they sold the rest to buy oil and salt to eat. People all said: "Look! The children in the kindergarten are like balls blown up in one breath."

Wang Yang'er's family had five children. The mother didn't care about them. She didn't care if they slept on the street. The fourth child, who was five years old, ate broken melons and jujubes and drank cold water every day. His belly was very big, but his face was yellow and thin. After coming to the kindergarten for less than three months, he became a very healthy child. Wang Guixiang's youngest daughter was very weak, but she became red and fat soon after coming to the kindergarten.

Shi Laoru, who cooked for them, was fifty-six years old. His beard was all white, but he was so conscientious and responsible. Even when cooking coarse grains, he made them very carefully. He used scallions, garlic, soy sauce, and star anise to make the dishes flavorful. He picked up the leftover dry food crumbs from the children little by little and made them into sauce. They had never spent money to buy sauce.

During the Spring Festival, the children all had holidays and left. In this large courtyard, only the seven elderly people in the home for the elderly were left, all of whom had been long-term workers for a lifetime and had no relatives. Lao Ru couldn't bear to leave them. He only went home for a meal and hurried back to celebrate the New Year with them.

This spring, Shi Laoru's cousin came from Baoding to find him to work as a cook, with a salary of more than thirty yuan a month. Deputy Brigade Commander Shan Jingyan said: "You can't go there. These children and old people are entrusted to you." Someone secretly said to Lao Ru: "Throw this mess away and sneak away on the train in the middle of the night." Lao Ru said: "I would rather not spend a penny in my life than do something that would let down the old people and children." The children said repeatedly: "Grandpa, I like this grandpa."

	The Last Night

When the children first entered the kindergarten, they wouldn't listen even if the nannies shouted themselves hoarse. The nannies said: "These little trees really have a lot of branches." In less than three months, the children changed. If any nanny was a little unhappy, they would surround her and say: "What's wrong, Auntie? Let's persuade her." As soon as the nanny swept the floor, they hurriedly grabbed the broom. The quilts they folded themselves were neater and prettier than those folded by new brides. After the older children put on their clothes, they hurried to the younger class to help the nannies button up the younger children's clothes and tie their belts. If their mothers gave them something delicious, they always brought it back for the other children to eat. Over the year, they learned more than forty songs and dances. They liked this song the most:

Kindergarten is my home, Auntie is my dear mother,
She teaches us to sing and dance, to nurture us to grow up quickly.

This year, after the wheat harvest holiday, primary school was about to start. More than twenty children in the kindergarten's senior class were going to school. This was the first group of children in history to go to school from kindergarten, and the nannies were particularly excited. Like mothers sending their daughters to get married, they washed their clothes, gave them baths, and cut their hair two days in advance. The children said: "Can we go to school and come back to the kindergarten to sleep?" The nannies said: "If you miss the kindergarten, you can come here anytime. This is always your home." Originally, the children should have moved their quilts back home to sleep before school started, but they didn't. They slept there until the last night. This night was a clear summer night. It was already past ten o'clock, but the children were still unwilling to go inside to sleep. They held the nannies' hands tightly, pulled on the nannies' clothes, looked at the bright little stars in the sky, and sang, sang, singing all the songs they had learned in the past year. How could anyone forget how the nannies had taken care of them and taught them over the past year? The next day, just as dawn broke, they all got up. The nannies dressed them in clean clothes, combed their hair, and put fragrant powder on each little girl, and a red dot on their foreheads. Grandpa Shi Laoru cooked the most fragrant noodles for them. Just as they put down their bowls, Jia Huilan, the first-grade teacher at the primary school, came to pick them up. They said in trembling little voices to the old people and Shi Laoru: "Goodbye, Grandpa, Goodbye, Grandma." The old people couldn't help but shed tears. All the children and nannies, in neat formation, sent them to the school. When the nannies returned to the kindergarten, it felt like a big piece was missing from their hearts. Recalling this year, how they were naughty, how they got sick, how they became so good, how they went to school...

The next day, just as school was dismissed, the nannies were already waiting at the school gate. Teacher Jia asked: "What are you doing?" The nannies said: "The village gave a cart of watermelons. We're taking them back to eat."

	Good Children

Jia Huilan was teaching first grade for the first time. She understood that it was only by laying a good foundation in first grade that it would be easier to teach later. Some of the newly enrolled children were very naughty. While the class was in session, they would say: "I'm hungry. I'm going home to get food." So Jia Huilan was very afraid of teaching first grade. However, Wang Jichen, who came from the kindergarten, mysteriously said to the teacher after school for the first time: "Teacher, I'm not leaving." "Why?" "Wait a bit!" When Teacher Jia sent all the students away and returned to the classroom, she saw that he was sweeping the floor with a big broom. She stood quietly outside the door watching him, feeling touched and thinking: "This is the first time I've seen a first-grade student like this. He's really a child who came from kindergarten." After that, he did this every day. Whenever the principal talked about part-time work and study and selling grass, he would come to school at noon carrying a full basket of grass. His mother said: "Every day when he comes home, he puts down his books and goes to cut grass. He doesn't come back to eat until the basket is full, and then it's time to go to school." Children who hadn't been to kindergarten always said when they saw others sweeping the floor: "Clean up my area a bit." The children who came from kindergarten had forgotten the word "I." They shared their pens and paper with whoever didn't have them, and they were very disciplined. Their average score was over ninety points. Several who got all hundred points were all children from the kindergarten. Six group leaders were all from among them. They could criticize, praise, and reason. They were truly little backbones among the children. They took time to discuss with each other: "Are you going to see Auntie?" "Yes!" In this way, they had to go to the kindergarten first after school every day before they were willing to go home.

	Mothers

When the kindergarten children performed songs and dances at a mass meeting for the first time, the mothers all stood up, gesturing and saying: "Hey! That one is from our family." "Look, the third one is mine." "How can our child do this?" Five-year-old Huang Xiufen, who had four sisters, only had a younger brother who was the apple of her mother's eye. Now, not only did she beat the rhythm to conduct the kindergarten children's singing, but when the Liberation Army uncles invited her, she also stood in front of their dignified ranks to conduct them in singing "Socialism is Good." Her mother said: "Oh! I never thought of her as a person. She has such great abilities. She has truly taken the socialist road well."

When the kindergarten was first established, a very dirty child came. Her name was Wang Shuping, five years old, with a face full of snot and eye mucus, and her hair was tangled and stuck to her scalp, taking a long time to comb through. Someone asked: "Whose child is this?" People who knew the details sarcastically said: "This is the child of the head of the sanitation team. How can she be so dirty?" It turned out that this was the dirtiest family in the village. The man's name was Wang Gang'er, and the woman's name was Li Shufang. Li Shufang never went to work in the fields. Her house and courtyard were so messy that outsiders couldn't find a place to step. The couple fought all day long, and the villagers gave her the nickname "Head of the Sanitation Team." At first, she was a little embarrassed to answer, but later she became thick-skinned, and she answered whoever called her that, and this became her nickname. Since the commune was established, her older children went to school, and the younger ones entered the kindergarten. The village leaders bought her children a set of single clothes and a cotton-padded coat. Every time the children came back from the kindergarten, they were white and clean all over, and they had the smell of soap. She looked at the children, then looked down at herself, and looked at this home, and her face flushed red. From then on, she went to work in the fields every day, and when she came back, she cleaned the house, washed clothes, and also raised a piglet. She planted tobacco leaves, sweet potatoes, and scallions in the yard, and managed them very well, like a small garden. From the beginning of spring to the wheat harvest, in five months, the couple earned 2,700 work points. In addition to eating grain, they also divided thirty yuan and six cents. She first bought a bright white mat to lay on the bed, bought five yards of cloth, made a new set of clothes for each member of the family, bought two lamb's wool scarves, and also bought five pieces of farm tools. She put on sky-blue pants, a white blouse with green flowers, and covered her head with a white scarf. When she looked in the mirror, she suddenly remembered: "Oh! I'm only twenty-eight years old. I'm still young! In the past, people said I was forty years old. It's true." She came out of the house carrying a hoe, and the villagers immediately surrounded her: "Oh! She's really become the head of the sanitation team now. Head of the sanitation team, hey—" She answered loudly "Here!", and her eyes immediately turned red. Thinking about the past, she was really ashamed. In the past, because she didn't go to work in the fields, they quarreled all day long. Every time there was a meeting of commune members, she was criticized. Whenever a meeting was mentioned, her heart would beat like a drum. The road to the meeting place, which was originally very short, she would always go forward and backward, and she couldn't reach it for a long time. Now, as soon as a meeting is mentioned, she runs there as if her feet don't touch the ground, because she is always the object of praise. When the couple came home from work, the woman said: "You quarrel, you scold me again, why don't you scold me?" The man covered his face: "It's like I married a new wife." When little Shuping stood on the street, someone said: "This is the child of the head of the sanitation team." Only admiring smiles remained on people's faces.

Now, the old people are talking behind their backs: "Every child is a pearl in the mother's heart. The adults don't have time to follow them all the time. These pearls are scattered all over the village. With the kindergarten, it's like they've been strung together with a red thread, stringing the adults' hearts together too, and they'll never be lost again." "Tell me, what kind of thread should this thread be?" "The general line for building socialism." "Yes! This is truly a line of happiness."

    红线穿珍珠
    刘真
    人民公社的好处说不尽道不完，今天咱们不说别的，只说说徐水县遂城人民公社南张丰生产大队的幼儿园。
      突破难关
    1958年的初冬，这个幼儿园刚成立三个月，共有九十二个孩子，都是全托，在一天之内，就有六个孩子发起高烧来，来势很凶。园长王桂芝，急的吃不下饭了，忙在小医院里收拾了一间隔离室，派最认真负责、最有耐心的李淑华去照管病孩子。
    公社党委会的陈书记，每次找村支部书记们汇报，首先问幼儿园的情况，从病情，治疗，吃穿住，一直问到学会了几个歌，是不是懂礼貌了，关心的真是周到。村支部书记张克荣，对全体保育员说：“这是我们办幼儿园的第一年，能不能巩固下去，这次病就是考验。”说完，他立刻给病孩子拿来最好的大米白面，还亲自跑到北京、保定去买来了白糖、水果。并再三对医生说：“一定要把每个孩子的病都治好。咱们搞公社，大跃进全是为了他们。”他每天跑到病房来四、五次，半夜还要来一趟，耐心的把哭着的孩子拍睡着。他对李淑华说：“要拿出高度的共产主义精神来，把这些孩子看成是自己最亲的人，不要有一点的粗心大意，需要什么，只要说话，都尽量想法解决。”
    李淑华听了支部书记的话，又感动又觉得实在是沉重。她二十三岁，虽然结婚几年了，却没有孩子，更没有照护过生病的孩子。把眼前这些病孩子照料好，确是一件不容易的事。她一天给他们熬六服中药，不吃东西的，她一滴滴的往他们嘴里灌水。这一个尿了，那一个拉了一被子屎，她立刻就洗刷的很干净，一点不好的气味也不留下。有人说：
  “淑华呀，你平常是那么干净俐落的人，现在整天抓屎巴巴，受的了吗？”她说：“一心一意只想叫孩子们好，什么脏味也闻不着了。”有一个叫小静的女孩发着高烧，李淑华直抱了她三天三夜，她的胳膀疼的半月伸不开。有一天她婆婆跑来对她说：“你别干这个啦，孩子要是出个好歹，你怎么办？”这话使李淑华觉得很害怕，她想让园长换个人，可是她猛然醒悟了，她对婆婆说：“妈呀！你就放心吧，我就是把心血使尽了，也要照顾好这些孩子，要是在这样的时候我离开他们，我心里难受。”
    经过了她的细心照顾，十四个病孩子，一个月的时间，全都好了。小静的妈妈李爱琴说：“这孩子要是没有幼儿园，早死了，这个幼儿园，我和我的孩子一辈子也忘不了。”王老歧家有六个孩子，妈妈两腿残废，只一个劳动力，每年都是缺粮户，这次，她的两个孩子都在幼儿园生了麻疹加肺炎，孩子好了第一次回家看她的时候，她摸着两个孩子的头说：“要不是人民公社，要不是幼儿园，老爷爷（太阳）早晒不着你小哥儿俩的头了。”听了这些话，李淑华哭了，她想：幼儿园呀！你总算是第一次从困难中走出来了。
        好食堂
    敬老院的七个老人，和孩子们是一个食堂。有一次检查团来了说：“这是个最好的食堂，县里也不如他们吃的花样多。”大队领导上，把最好的粮食给他们吃，两只大奶牛挤了奶，给他们和面做干粮，在试验田里，专门给他们种了一块菜，每天吃不完，还卖了买油盐吃。人们都说：“看！幼儿园的孩子，像一口气吹起来的皮球一样。”
    王羊儿家有五个孩子，妈妈不拿她们当回事，他们睡在大街上她也不管。第四个孩子五岁了，天天吃破瓜乱枣，喝凉水，吃的肚子很大，脸却又黄又瘦，来到幼儿园不到三个月，就变成了一个很健康的孩子。王桂祥的小女儿很瘦弱，来幼儿园不久，变得又红又胖。
    给他们做饭吃的石老如，五十六岁，胡子都白了，却那么认真负责，吃粗粮，他也做的很细致。他用葱蒜，酱油，花椒大料，把菜做的有滋有味。孩子们吃剩的干粮渣，他一点点的捏起来做成酱，他们没有用钱买过酱。
    春节，孩子们都放假走了，在这个大院子里，只剩下七个敬老院的老人，都是当了一辈子长工的，没有亲人。老如不忍离开他们，只回家吃顿饭，就急忙跑回来，同他们一块儿过年。
    今年春天，石老如的表弟从保定来找他去当炊事员，一个月三十多元的薪金。副大队长单景严说：“你那里也不能去，这些孩子和老人就交给你了。”有人偷偷对老如说：“把这摊子一扔，半夜偷偷坐火车溜了。”老如说：“我宁愿一辈子不花一分钱，也不干那对不起老人和孩子的事。”孩子们口口声声说：“爷爷，我喜欢这个爷爷。”
      最后一夜
    孩子们刚入幼儿园的时候，阿姨把嗓子喊哑了他们也不听，阿姨们说：“这些小树，杈杈可真多。”三个月不到，孩子们都变了，哪个阿姨稍有点不高兴，他们就围上来说：“阿姨怎么啦？咱们劝劝她吧。”阿姨一扫地，他们急忙夺条帚，他们自己折的小被子，比新媳妇折的还整齐好看哩。大班穿好衣服，急忙到小班来帮助阿姨给小朋友扣扣子，扎腰带。妈妈给点好吃的，总要拿回来给小朋友吃。一年来，他们学会了四十多个歌舞。他们最喜欢这个歌：
    幼儿园是我家，阿姨是我的亲妈妈，
    教我们唱歌又跳舞，培养我们快长大。
    今年放完了麦假，小学要开学了，幼儿园大班有二十多个孩子要入学，这是有史以来第一批从幼儿园到学校去的孩子，阿姨们特别兴奋。像妈妈送姑娘出嫁一样，头两天，就给他们洗好了衣服，洗了澡，理了发。孩子们说：“我们在学校上学，回到幼儿园来睡觉行不？”阿姨说：“你们要是想幼儿园，什么时候来了这里也是你们的家。”本来在入学以前，孩子们就该把被子搬回家去睡觉，可是他们不，他们一直睡到最后一夜。这一夜，是夏天晴朗的夜，已经十点多了，孩子们还不肯进屋去睡觉，他们紧紧拉着阿姨的手，拉着阿姨的衣服，看着天上明亮的小星星们，唱啊，唱啊，把一年多学的歌统统唱了一遍。这一年多来，阿姨怎样带他们，教他们，谁能忘得了啊？第二天刚黎明，都起来了，阿姨给他们穿上干净衣服，梳洗完了，每个小姑娘都擦上香粉，眉头上点上红点儿，石老如爷爷给他们做熟了最香的面条儿。刚放下碗，小学一年级的贾慧兰老师就来接他们了。他们颤抖着小声音，对敬老院的老人和石老如说：“爷爷再见，奶奶再见。”老人们忍不住的流了热泪。全体小朋友，阿姨，排着整齐的队伍，把他们送到学校里。阿姨们回到幼儿园，好像心里少了一大块，回想这一年，他们调皮，他们生病，他们又变的这样好了，他们入学去了……。
    第二天小学刚放学，阿姨们早就在学校门口等着了，贾老师问：“干什么？”阿姨说：“村里给了一车西瓜，接他们回去吃。”
      好孩子
    贾慧兰，是第一次教一年级，她懂得，只有在一年级打好基础以后才好教。有些刚入学的孩子，很顽皮，正上着课他们就说：“我饿啦，回家拿饽饽。”所以贾慧兰很怕教一年级。可是，从幼儿园来的王季晨，第一次放学就神秘的对老师说：“老师，我不走。”“为什么？”“待会儿呗！”等贾老师送走了所有的同学，回到教室一看，他正拿着大条帚扫地哩。她悄悄的站在门外看着他，感动的想：“我第一次看见这样的一年级生，真是幼儿园出来的孩子。”以后，他每天都这样。校长一说要勤工俭学、打草卖，他中午来上学，都是提着满满一篮子草。他妈妈说：“他每天回到家，放下书就去打草，打满了篮子才回来吃饭，吃了饭就到上学的时候了。”没入过幼儿园的孩子，一看见别人扫地，总是说：“把我这个地方扫干净点。”幼儿园出来的孩子，都把“我”字忘了，他们的笔、纸，谁没有了就给谁用，非常守纪律，平均分数都是九十多分。有几个全一百分的，都是幼儿园的孩子。六个小组长，都是他们当着，他们会批评，会表扬，会说理，真是儿童中的小骨干。他们抽空互相商量着：“你去看阿姨不？”“去！”这样，他们每天放了学，一定要先去瞧瞧幼儿园，才肯回家去。
        妈妈们
    当幼儿园的孩子们第一次在群众大会上表演歌舞的时候，妈妈们都站起来了，指手划脚的说：“咦！那一个是我们家的。”“看，第三个是我的。”“怎么我们那孩子还会这个呀。”五岁的小黄秀芬，姐妹四个，只有一个小弟弟是她妈的心肝宝贝儿。现在，她不但打拍子指挥幼儿园的小朋友唱歌，解放军叔叔请她，她也站在他们威严的队前，指挥他们唱社会主义好。她妈说：“哟！我就没把她当成一个人，她有这么大的本事呀，她可是走好了社会主义路了。”
    幼儿园刚成立的时候，来了一个最脏的孩子，她叫王淑平，五岁，满脸是鼻涕，眼屎，头发乱七八糟的贴在头皮上，老半天也梳不通。有人问：“这是谁家的孩子？”知底细的人就讽刺地说：“这是卫生组长的孩子呗，怎么还会不干净。”原来，这是村里最脏的一户人家，男的叫王刚儿，女的叫李淑芳。李淑芳从来不下地干活，她屋里、院里，叫外人没法下脚，两口子整天打架，乡亲们给她起了个外号叫“卫生组长”，开始她有点不好意思答应，后来就皮了，谁喊也答应，这就变成她的大号了。自从公社化以后，她的大孩子上学，小孩子入了幼儿园，村领导上给她的孩子买了一身单衣，一件棉大衣。孩子每次从幼儿园回来，全身又白又干净，还有香皂的气味。她看看孩子，又低头看看自己，看看这个家，脸上腾的一下红了。从此，她每天下地劳动，回来就打扫屋子，洗衣服，还喂了一个小猪。把院子里种上烟叶、甘薯、小葱，都管理的很好，像个小花园一样。从开春到麦收，五个月的时间，两口子做了两千七百分，除了吃粮，还分了三十元零六分。她首先买了一张白亮亮的炕席铺上，买了五丈布，给全家每人做了一套新衣服，买了两条羊肚手巾，还买了五件农具。她穿上了天蓝裤，白地绿花褂儿，蒙上白手巾，到镜子面前一照，这才忽然想起来：“哟！我才二十八岁，我还年青着哩！从前，人家都说我有四十了，真是的。”她扛着锄从家里出来，乡亲们立刻围住了她：“唉哟！这可真变成卫生组长了，卫生组长哎——”她响亮的答应一声“到！”，眼圈立刻就红了，想起过去，真是臊死人了。从前，因为她不下地干活，整天吵架，每次开社员会，她都是受批评，一提开会，她心里就打鼓，到会场去的路，本来很短，她老是前走走后倒倒，半天走不到。现在，一说开会，她像脚不沾地一样就跑到了，因为她每次都是表扬的对象。他们两口子下班回到家来，女的说：“你吵哇，你再骂我呀，怎么不骂啦？”男的把脸一捂：“我好像娶来了一个新媳妇。”当小淑平站在大街上，有人说：“这是卫生组长家的孩子。”人们的脸上，只剩下赞美的笑容了。
    现在，老人们背后谈论着：“那个孩子都是妈妈心里的珍珠宝贝，大人们没空光跟着他们，这些珠子，满村的散乱着，有了幼儿园，就像是用一条红线把他们穿起来了，把大人的心也穿起来了，永远失散不了了。”“你说说，这条线该是一条什么线呢？”“建设社会主义的总路线呗。”“是啊！这可真是一条幸福的线。”
