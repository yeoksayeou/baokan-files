Talking About Friendship on the Tenth Anniversary of National Day
President of the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, Zhu Kezhen

Ten years is but a brief moment in the history of mankind. However, these ten years—from 1949 to 1959—are ten years of great historical significance, ten years of glory, and ten years filled with victories for the people of China and the people of the German Democratic Republic. On October 1st, ten years ago, the first five-star red flag was raised in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and the Chinese people stood up ever since. On October 7th, ten years ago, the German Democratic Republic was founded, and from then on, a worker-peasant regime appeared in the homeland of Marx and Engels. In the past decade, despite the constant curses, slanders, and all kinds of conspiracies and sabotages by imperialism and all reactionaries, the German Democratic Republic, standing at the western forefront of the socialist camp, and the People's Republic of China, standing at the eastern forefront of the socialist camp, have stood tall and are increasingly moving towards prosperity and strength. As we proudly look back on these glorious ten years, we naturally think that all our achievements are inseparable from the friendly unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

As early as during the First Revolutionary Civil War in our country, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and massacred the Chinese people, Ernst Thälmann, the outstanding leader of the German workers' movement, called on the German people to hold demonstrations to oppose the transportation of weapons and ammunition to the reactionaries; he also called for other actions to support the Chinese revolution. On November 7, 1931, the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of China was held in Ruijin, and the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government headed by Chairman Mao was established. On November 14th, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, headed by Thälmann, sent a warm congratulatory telegram, considering the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government as "the only legitimate government of the Chinese people" and closely linking the Chinese people's revolution with the German workers' struggle against imperialism.

The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic has brought the friendship between our two countries into a new historical stage. In these ten years, our two countries have signed the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and various agreements on trade, culture, science and technology, post and telecommunications, health, and broadcasting. These treaties and agreements are the bonds of friendly unity and mutual assistance between our two countries. In these ten years, the leaders of the German Democratic Republic's party and government, Ulbricht, Grotewohl, Dieckmann, Matern, Stoph, and others, have visited our country successively. The leaders of our party and government, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, and others, have also visited the German Democratic Republic successively. The mutual visits of leaders of the two countries have made significant contributions to the development of the friendly relations between our two countries. The Chinese people fully support the German Democratic Republic in its struggle against West German militarization, the abolition of the West Berlin occupation system, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

In the past decade, the economic cooperation between our two countries has also been developing, and the trade volume between the two countries is constantly increasing. The development of this economic cooperation is not only conducive to the economic construction of the two countries, but also shows the profound friendship between our two countries. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have given fraternal and enthusiastic assistance to our country's socialist construction, and we sincerely thank the German Democratic Republic for its selfless assistance.

The cultural cooperation between our two countries has also made great progress in the past decade. Up to now, our country has had 137 delegations with 1,306 scientists, artists, journalists and other cultural figures visiting the German Democratic Republic, and the German Democratic Republic has sent 117 delegations with 843 scientists, artists, journalists and other cultural figures to visit our country. The Chinese people hold the German people, who have made great contributions to world science and culture, in high esteem. The music of composers such as Beethoven, Handel, Schumann, Strauss, etc., has never been unfamiliar to the Chinese people. The excellent works of famous German classical and modern writers such as Goethe, Heine, Schiller, Anna Seghers, and Willi Bredel have a large number of readers in our country. Cultural cooperation over the past decade has played a positive role in strengthening mutual understanding between our two countries and promoting the prosperity of our socialist culture.

Our two countries are brotherly countries born in the same year and the same month. Although geographically separated by thousands of miles, our common cause and common ideals closely link us together. The glorious decade has passed, and new and greater victories are greeting us.

While celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, the Chinese people extend warm congratulations to the people of the German Democratic Republic, who are advancing bravely on the road of socialist construction and are also celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of their country. We highly cherish and care for the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between our country and the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This great proletarian internationalist friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation is a strong guarantee for the socialist construction of our brother countries, and it cannot be shaken by any force. Victory will always belong to us.

    十周年国庆话友谊
    中华人民共和国德意志民主共和国友好协会会长　竺可桢
    十年，这在整个人类历史上只是短暂的一瞬，可是这十年——1949年到1959年——对我们中国人民和德意志民主共和国的人民说来，是具有重大历史意义的十年，光辉的十年，充满着胜利的十年。十年前的10月1日，北京天安门广场上升起了第一面五星红旗，中国人民从此站起来了。十年前的10月7日，德意志民主共和国成立，从此在马克思、恩格斯的故乡出现了工农政权。十年来，尽管帝国主义和一切反动派在不断地咒骂、诽谤和千方百计地阴谋破坏，但是站在社会主义阵营西方最前哨的德意志民主共和国和站在社会主义阵营东方最前哨的中华人民共和国巍然地矗立着，并且日益走向繁荣富强。在我们充满自豪地回顾这光辉的十年的同时，我们很自然地联想到，我们的一切成就是和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友好团结分不开的。
    早在我国第一次国内革命战争的年代里，当蒋介石叛变革命、大肆屠杀中国人民的时期，德国工人运动的杰出领袖恩斯特·台尔曼就号召德国人民用游行示威来反对运送武器和弹药给反动派；他还号召采取其他的行动来支持中国的革命。1931年11月7日我国第一次工农兵代表大会在瑞金召开，产生了以毛主席为首的中央工农民主政权。11月14日以台尔曼为首的德共中央拍来热烈的贺电，认为中国工农民主政府是“中国人民的唯一合法政府”，并且把中国人民的革命与德国工人反对帝国主义的斗争紧密地联系起来。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的成立，使我们两国之间的友谊进入一个新的历史阶段。在这十年中，我们两国之间签订了中德友好合作条约和贸易、文化、科技、邮电、卫生、广播等各种协定。这些条约和协定是我们两国之间友好团结和相互援助的纽带。在这十年中，德意志民主共和国的党和政府的领导人乌布利希、格罗提渥、狄克曼、马特恩、斯多夫等都先后访问了我国。我国的党和政府的领导人周恩来、朱德、董必武、陈毅等也先后访问了德意志民主共和国。两国领导人的相互访问对发展我们两国的友好关系作出了重大的贡献。中国人民全力支持德意志民主共和国为反对西德军国主义化、废除西柏林占领制度和缔结对德和约所进行的斗争。
    这十年来，我们两国之间经济上的合作也日益发展，两国之间的贸易额正在不断增长，这种经济合作的发展不仅有利于两国的经济建设，而且显示了我们两国之间的深厚友情。德意志民主共和国政府和人民在我国建设社会主义的事业中给予了兄弟般的热情援助，我们衷心地感谢德意志民主共和国给予我们的无私援助。
    我们两国的文化合作在这十年中也有了很大的发展。到目前为止，我国已有一百三十七起一千三百零六位科学家、艺术家、新闻工作者和其他文化界人士访问德意志民主共和国，德意志民主共和国共派遣了一百一十七起八百四十三位科学家、艺术家、新闻工作者和其他文化界人士到我国进行访问。我国人民对向世界科学、文化作出了重大贡献的德国人民怀着崇高的敬意。贝多芬、亨德尔、舒曼、斯特劳斯等作曲家的乐曲对我国人民来讲素来不是陌生的。歌德、海?、席勒、安娜·西格斯、威利·布莱德尔等德国著名的古典和现代作家的优秀作品在我国拥有大量的读者。十年来的文化合作，对加强我们两国之间的相互了解，促进我国社会主义文化的繁荣，起了良好的作用。
    我们两国是同年同月诞生的兄弟国家，在地理上虽然相隔万里，可是共同的事业，共同的理想把我们紧紧地联结在一起。光辉的十年过去了，新的更大的胜利正在迎向我们。
    中国人民在庆祝自己建国十周年的同时，向正在社会主义建设大道上勇往直前的，并且也在欢庆建国十周年的德意志民主共和国人民致以热烈的祝贺。我们十分珍视和爱护我国与以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的友好团结和互助合作。这种伟大的无产阶级国际主义的友好团结和互助合作是我们兄弟国家进行社会主义建设的有力保证，是任何力量都不能动摇的。胜利永远属于我们。
