The State Council's directive issued on October 11th regarding mobilizing the masses to widely collect and fully utilize wild plant materials calls on all regions to seize the opportunity, fully mobilize the masses, and launch a "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign. This involves collecting all usable wild plant materials and treating the collection, processing, purchasing, and utilization of wild plant materials as an important component of the entire autumn harvest and procurement of agricultural products. The collection, purchase, and utilization of wild plant materials are of great significance for increasing social wealth, ensuring the continued great leap forward of the national economy, and increasing the income of the people's communes and their members.

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the people throughout the country to build socialism. A new high tide of the Great Leap Forward has emerged on all fronts of the national economy, and production is advancing by leaps and bounds. The continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy requires the countryside to provide a larger quantity and a greater variety of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties as raw materials for industrial production. Judging from the current situation, this year's agricultural production and the production of general agricultural and sideline local specialties will be a bumper harvest, and the amount of procurement will also increase greatly. These can all be affirmed. However, measured against the greater needs put forward by the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, agricultural raw materials are still not sufficient to fully meet the needs of industrial production and people's lives.

The solution is to do a good job in the production and procurement of agricultural and sideline products on the one hand; and to fully mobilize the masses to vigorously collect wild plant materials to supplement the insufficiency of cultivated plant materials on the other hand. Widely collecting, purchasing, and utilizing wild plant materials is one of the important measures to promote the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy, and this is precisely the significance of the State Council's directive.

Our country is extremely rich in wild plant materials, and more than a thousand important raw materials have been discovered. Among them, there are more than 400 kinds of wild oil plants, more than 300 kinds of wild fiber plants, more than 100 kinds of wild starches and fruits, more than 80 kinds of wild chemical raw materials, and more than 200 kinds of wild medicinal plants. If all the wild plant materials are fully utilized, they can provide the country with a large amount of industrial raw materials, consumer goods, and export goods, and can increase the income of the people's communes and farmers by a large amount. Many regions have calculated that if the work of collecting wild plants is done well, each farmer's household can increase its income by an average of more than ten or even dozens of yuan. This is a material resource with great potential, and all localities should further implement the policy of "investigation and research, overall planning, full utilization, and active development" put forward by the State Council in April 1958, and earnestly do a good job in this area.

At present, to complete the task of collecting and processing wild plant materials, it is necessary to organize a mass short-term shock campaign. Wild plant materials are widely distributed, production is relatively dispersed, and seasonality is very strong. In addition, the season for collecting wild plant materials is also the season when various rural tasks are very busy, which determines that the collection work has great dispersion, mass participation, and a shock nature. Based on these characteristics, all localities should, under the overall arrangement of various rural tasks, seize the season when wild plant materials are ripe, use all production gaps, allocate the necessary labor force, mobilize and organize all idle labor forces in the countryside, and go to the mountains, forests, and grasslands in a planned and organized manner for ten days, half a month, or twenty days to carry out a mass shock campaign to collect wild plant materials. Only by organizing short-term mass shock campaigns can we seize the opportunity and collect all usable wild plant materials. At the same time, we must also see that in addition to the current season for collecting large quantities of wild plants, there are also some wild plants that should be collected in spring, summer, and other seasons. Therefore, we must also pay attention to the regular collection and purchase of wild plant materials and be good at combining shock work with regular work.

The collection of wild plant materials must implement the policy of collective operation and individual operation at the same time, and adopt a system of more work, more gain, and appropriate rewards. According to the experience of some localities, those wild plant materials with large production volume, concentration, high income, large investment, strong technical requirements, and a large labor force should generally be operated by the production team or production brigade, and some can also be operated uniformly by the commune; otherwise, the collection, processing, and purchase work cannot be carried out smoothly, and even affect the development of the collective economy. For some varieties, it is also necessary to establish temporary or permanent specialized production teams (groups) for collection, processing, and cultivation. Scattered wild plant materials should generally be operated by individual members, mobilizing individual members to use the time before and after work, during breaks, and on holidays to collect, and mobilizing the old, weak, and semi-able-bodied to collect. In this way, all idle manpower can be fully mobilized and organized without affecting the normal progress of agricultural production. Experience has proven that fully mobilizing both collective and individual enthusiasm to widely collect wild plant materials has two indispensable important conditions. One is putting politics in command; the other is rationally assessing work points and correctly distributing income. Relying solely on economic incentives and not putting politics in command will make it difficult for the collection work to form a mass shock campaign, or will allow the masses to collect freely, which will affect the arrangement of agricultural production.

However, while adhering to the Party's leadership and putting politics in command, we must also appropriately take care of the individual economic interests of the members. The so-called appropriate care for the individual economic interests of the members means that in collective operation, the principle of more work, more gain must be implemented and supplemented with necessary reward systems; in individual operation, the production team or commune should, according to the actual situation, implement the principle of whoever collects gets or public-private sharing in the distribution. In short, whether it is collective operation or individual operation, no matter what specific method of distribution according to labor is adopted, the Party organizations of the production team and commune must strengthen leadership and make unified arrangements.

When mobilizing the masses to collect wild plant materials in large quantities, farmers should be educated to pay attention to protecting and cultivating wild plants. In order to prevent the phenomenon of some wild plant materials with greater economic value or wider uses from being collected less and less, on the one hand, the masses should be educated to pay attention to not harming the vitality of wild plants, and not to exhaust the source for the sake of temporarily increasing income; on the other hand, artificial cultivation should be promoted under possible conditions to improve variety quality, change wild plants into cultivated plants, so as to ensure reproduction, increase production, and meet needs.

Relevant departments must adopt a policy of actively supporting the collection and utilization of wild plant materials. Specifically: First, commercial departments and local processing departments must actively organize the purchase and processing of wild plant materials collected by the people's communes, production teams, and farmers. Second, commercial departments must clarify the varieties and plans for purchase to the communes, production teams, and farmers in advance, so that farmers can concentrate their efforts on collecting wild resources needed by the state, so as to avoid farmers collecting wild plants that are not needed by the state and cannot be utilized at present, resulting in waste and dampening the enthusiasm of the masses for collection. Third, industrial departments should cooperate with commercial departments, fully utilize wild plant materials, process and sell products made from wild materials. It is necessary to overcome negative ideas such as emphasizing difficulties, fearing trouble, fearing stockpiling, and fearing losses, vigorously tap the potential in this area, and actively solve technical problems in order to increase raw materials and expand production. Fourth, commercial, local industrial, agricultural, forestry, scientific research, and other departments should earnestly strengthen technical guidance for the collection and processing of wild plants, and actively organize the supply of production tools and production equipment. Wild plants are of uneven quality, and it is necessary to gradually stipulate simple and easy-to-implement standards and specifications, and tell the masses as early as possible, so as to facilitate collection and purchase. Fifth, for newly discovered useful wild plant materials, collection, processing, and sales should be actively and selectively organized, but before large-scale production and large-scale purchase, a trial production and sales process must be carried out, and then gradually promoted.

Now, many wild plant materials have matured or are about to mature, and the season for collecting and purchasing wild plant materials has arrived. The Party committees and people's committees of all localities should, in accordance with the State Council's directive, combine the "Directive of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Doing a Good Job in the Procurement of Agricultural Products in 1959" issued on September 23, 1959, and the "Directive of the State Council on the Utilization and Collection of Wild Plant Materials in Our Country" issued on April 7, 1958, immediately make a comprehensive plan and unified arrangement for the collection, processing, purchase, transfer, and utilization of wild plant materials, organize close cooperation between various relevant departments, especially between supply, production, and sales, oppose right-leaning ideas, encourage hard work, and launch a short-term mass "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign to collect wild plant materials all over the mountains and plains.

### 大家都来“小秋收”

　　大家都来“小秋收”
    国务院10月11日发布的关于发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示中，要求各地抓紧时机，充分发动群众，开展一次“小秋收”运动，把一切可以利用的野生植物原料统统采集起来，把野生植物原料的采集、加工、收购和利用工作作为整个秋季农产品收获和收购工作的重要组成部分。野生植物原料的采集、收购和利用，对于增加社会财富、保证国民经济的继续大跃进以及增加人民公社和社员的收入，都有重要意义。
    党的八届八中全会的号召，极大地鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义的热情。国民经济各个战线都出现了新的大跃进高潮，生产在一日千里地向前发展。国民经济的继续大跃进，要求农村提供数量更大、品种更多的农副产品和土特产品作为工业生产原料。根据目前情况看来，今年的农业生产和一般农副土特产品的生产都将丰收，收购数量也将会大大增加。这些都是可以肯定的。但是，同国民经济大跃进所提出的更大的需要来衡量，农业原料就还不能充分满足工业生产和人民生活的需要。
    解决的办法是一方面做好农副产品的生产和收购工作；一方面充分发动群众，大力采集野生植物原料，以补充家生植物原料之不足。广泛采集、收购和利用野生植物原料，这是推动国民经济继续大跃进的重要措施之一，这也正是国务院的指示的意义所在。
    我国野生植物原料极为丰富，已经发现的重要原料有一千多种。其中野生油料四百多种，野生纤维三百多种，野生淀粉、水果一百多种，野生化工原料八十多种，野生植物药材二百多种。如果把所有的野生植物原料都充分利用起来，就可以为国家提供大量的工业原料、消费资料和出口货源，可以给人民公社和农民增加大笔的收入。许多地区都曾作过计算：如果收集野生植物的工作作得好，平均每一个农户可以增加十几元甚至几十元的收入。这是一项有巨大潜力的物资资源，各地方应当进一步贯彻1958年4月国务院所提出的“调查研究、全面规划、充分利用、积极发展”的方针，切实做好这方面的工作。
    目前要完成野生植物原料的采集和加工任务，必须组织一个群众性的短期突击运动。野生植物原料分布很广，生产比较分散，季节性很强，加上采集野生植物原料的季节也正是农村各项工作十分繁忙的季节，这就决定了采集工作具有很大的分散性、群众性和突击性。根据这种特点，各地应当在各项农村工作统筹安排的条件下，抓紧野生植物原料的成熟季节，利用一切生产间隙，调配必要的劳动力，把农村所有的闲散劳动力都动员和组织起来，用十天、半月、二十天的时间，有计划有组织地上山、入林、进草原，开展群众性的采集野生植物原料的突击运动。只有组织短期的群众性的突击运动，才能不失时机，把一切可以利用的野生植物原料统统采集起来。同时，也要看到，除了目前是大量采集野生植物的季节以外，也还有一些野生植物，应当在春、夏等季节采集。因此还必须注意野生植物原料的经常采集和收购工作，善于把突击工作和经常工作结合起来。
    采集野生植物原料，必须实行集体经营和个人经营同时并举的方针，并且采取多劳多得和适当奖励的制度。根据一些地方的经验，那些生产量大、集中、收入多、投资大、技术性较强、需要劳动力较多的野生植物原料，一般应该由生产队或者生产大队经营，有些也可以由公社统一经营，否则采集、加工和收购工作就不能顺利地进行，甚至影响集体经济的发展；对其中某些品种，还必须建立临时的或经常的专业生产队（组），以便进行采集、加工和培育。而零星分散的野生植物原料，一般应由社员个人经营，发动社员个人利用上工前、下工后、工休、假日的时间进行采集，发动老弱以及半劳动力进行采集。这样就能够把一切闲散的人力都充分动员和组织起来，而不致影响农业生产的正常进行。经验证明，把集体的和个人的积极性都充分动员起来，广泛地采集野生植物原料，有两个不可缺少的重要条件。一是政治挂帅；一是合理评工记分、正确分配收益。单纯依靠经济刺激，不实行政治挂帅，采集工作就难以形成群众性突击运动，或是听任群众自由采集，而影响农业生产的安排。
　　但是，在坚持党的领导和政治挂帅的条件下，也必须适当照顾社员个人的经济利益。所谓适当照顾社员个人的经济利益，在集体经营方面是指必须实行多劳多得原则，并且辅之以必要的奖励制度；在个人经营方面，是指生产队或公社应当根据实际情况，在分配上实行谁采谁得或公私分成的原则。总之，不管是集体经营还是个人经营，不管是采取什么样的按劳分配的具体办法，生产队和公社的党组织，都必须加强领导，统一安排。
    在发动群众大量采集野生植物原料的时候，应当教育农民注意保护和培育野生植物。为了防止某些经济价值较大或者用途较广的野生植物原料发生越采越少的现象，一方面要教育群众注意不要伤害了野生植物的生机，不要为了一时增加收入而枯本竭源；另一方面，还要在可能条件下提倡人工培育，改进品种质量，变野生为家生，以保证繁殖，增加生产，适应需要。
    有关部门对于野生植物原料的采集和利用，必须采取积极扶持的方针。具体地说：第一，对于人民公社、生产队和农民采集的野生植物原料，商业部门和当地加工部门一定要积极组织收购和加工。第二，商业部门一定要事先把收购的品种和计划向公社、生产队和农民交代清楚，使农民集中力量采集国家需要的野生资源，免得农民把国家不需要的、目前无法利用的野生植物采集下来而不能出售，形成浪费并挫伤了群众采集的积极性。第三，工业部门应当同商业部门互相协作，充分利用野生植物原料，加工并销售野生原料的制品。必须克服强调困难、怕麻烦、怕积压、怕赔钱等消极思想，大力挖掘这方面的潜力，积极解决技术上的问题，以增加原料，扩大生产。第四，商业、地方工业、农业、林业、科学研究等部门，应该切实加强采集和加工野生植物的技术指导，积极组织生产工具和生产设备的供应。野生植物良莠不齐，有必要逐步规定简单易行的标准、规格，及早告诉群众，以利于采集和收购。第五，对于新发现的有用的野生植物原料，应该积极地有重点地组织采集、加工和销售，但是在大量生产大量收购之前，必须经过一个试产试销的过程，然后逐步推广。
    现在，许多野生植物原料已经成熟或即将成熟，采集和收购野生植物原料的季节已经到来。各地党委和人民委员会，应该根据国务院的指示，结合1959年9月23日中共中央、国务院关于做好1959年度农产品收购工作的指示和1958年4月7日国务院关于利用和收集我国野生植物原料的指示，立即对野生植物原料的采集、加工、收购、调运和利用作出全面规划和统一安排，组织各有关部门之间特别是供产销之间的密切协作，反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起一个短期的群众性的满山遍野的采集野生植物原料的“小秋收”运动。
