　　On the banks of the Daye Reservoir in Laiwu County, Shandong Province, twenty-one peculiar multi-tillering wheat plants were discovered. One of them had as many as one hundred and sixty-four tillers, and the fewest had one hundred and five tillers. All were effective tillers, with an average of 51.3 grains per ear, and a maximum of 67 grains, each seed being full and plump.

　　The average plant height of these wheat plants was 96.6 centimeters, with the tallest reaching 107 centimeters.
