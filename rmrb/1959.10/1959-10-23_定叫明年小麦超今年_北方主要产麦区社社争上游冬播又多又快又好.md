    Definitely Surpass This Year's Wheat Output Next Year
    Major Wheat Producing Areas in the North Compete to Be the Best; Winter Planting is More, Faster, and Better
    (Reported by our newspaper) Major wheat-producing areas in the north, taking advantage of the victories of the summer harvest and the autumn harvest, are exerting great effort to seize winter planting, striving for continued great leaps forward next year. Currently, wheat planting in Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces has been a complete success.
    This year, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, these four provinces have completed wheat planting faster, more extensively, and better. According to statistics, Shandong has completed 87.2% of its wheat planting task, expanding the area by 18.4 million mu compared to last year. Henan has completed over 92%, with many areas exceeding their planned targets. Shaanxi has sown more than 21.1 million mu of wheat, and 20 million mu has already sprouted, appearing as a green expanse. Shanxi has expanded its planting area by 2 million mu compared to last year, completing 98% of its plan. This year, these four provinces have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and paid attention to cultivating large areas of high-yield fields, striving to surpass this year's output next year.
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, October 22nd) Winter wheat planting in Shandong Province this year has been carried out more extensively, faster, and better. As of the 17th of this month, 87.2% of the province's 70 million mu of winter wheat planting task has been completed.
    This year, the winter wheat planting area in Shandong Province has been expanded by 18.4 million mu compared to last year. The planting time and progress have also been advanced by ten days to half a month compared to last year. Currently, more than 30 million mu of early-sown wheat seedlings have already taken root, appearing green everywhere. The late-sown wheat is being planted even more meticulously in various places.
    The winter wheat planting work in Shandong Province is being carried out by the people of the entire province under the inspiration of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, holding high the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. A socialist labor competition to win a greater bumper harvest of wheat next year has been launched throughout the province. At the start of the wheat planting campaign, nine counties, including Shou Zhang, five people's communes, including Licheng Eastern Suburb, and thirteen brigades, including the Taiqian Brigade of the Shou Zhang Taiqian Commune, respectively proposed to all counties, communes, and brigades in the province to launch a wheat high-yield competition. Subsequently, more than eighty counties and cities, more than one thousand communes, and more than ten thousand production teams across the province quickly responded and participated in this competition. In order to ensure that the wheat is planted well, ten million people involved in autumn planting and hundreds of thousands of cadres are living and eating in the fields. Tents are erected in the fields, red flags are fluttering during the day, and lights are shining brightly at night. The people are invincible in their efforts to win a greater bumper harvest next year.
    Now, all parts of Shandong are beginning to carry out field management tasks such as checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, controlling pests, and applying top dressing to wheat fields.
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, October 22nd) Wheat planting in Henan Province has basically ended.
    According to statistics on the 20th, the autumn planting area in Henan Province has reached more than 72 million mu, accounting for 90.4% of the autumn and winter planting plan. Among them, 62.52 million mu of wheat has been sown, completing more than 92% of the wheat planting task. Kaifeng and Xinxiang prefectures, which have made rapid progress, have greatly exceeded their wheat planting plans.
    This year, wheat planting in various parts of Henan Province has generally been advanced by ten days to half a month compared to previous years, and most wheat fields have been deeply ploughed. The province's autumn ploughed land (including those already sown) has reached more than 79.4 million mu, of which nearly 80% has been deeply ploughed to a depth of eight inches or more, greatly exceeding the provincial party committee's original target of deeply plowing 40 million mu. The area where base fertilizer was applied reached more than 74.6 million mu, with an average application rate of about 8,500 jin per mu. Land leveling this year is also very good. According to local plans, high-yield areas generally account for 20%-25%.
    During the wheat planting period, the autumn drought continued to expand. The 20 million agricultural army that had been fighting the summer drought for eighty or ninety days immediately plunged into the high tide of drought-resistant wheat planting without removing their armor or unsaddling their horses. According to statistics on the 20th, more than 21.25 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been planted in drought-resistant conditions. In the process of drought-resistant wheat planting, in accordance with the principle of building and using at the same time, the province also mobilized more than 3 million laborers to engage in large-scale water conservancy construction. Since October, more than 10 million mu of irrigation area has been improved and newly expanded.
    Now, there are still more than 10 million mu of late-sown wheat in the province that are being planted in a timely manner to ensure that the late-sown catches up with the early-sown. Areas where wheat seedlings have already emerged are transitioning to seedling management, heavily watering and applying root fertilizer, checking seedlings and replanting patches to ensure full stands per mu without any broken ridges.
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, October 22nd) The amount of wheat sown by various sowing machines in Shaanxi Province this year has greatly increased compared to last year, and the sowing quality is good. At present, more than 20 million mu of wheat in the province, including those sown with other agricultural tools, has emerged, showing a tender green.
    This year, the province plans to sow 25 million mu of wheat, an increase of 14% compared to last year. As of October 18th, the province had sown more than 21.1 million mu, of which more than 8 million mu were sown with tractor-drawn and animal-drawn sowing machines. It is estimated that the province's area sown by machines this year can exceed 10 million mu, reaching about half of the total wheat field area. In the Guanzhong Plain, the main wheat-producing area, the increase in the area sown by machines is particularly large due to the fertile land and flat terrain. For example, the area sown by machines in Hancheng County this year has doubled compared to last year; the area sown by machines in Xianyang City accounts for 80% of the total wheat field area; and Pucheng County accounts for 66%.
    The fact that the area sown by machines has increased significantly once again demonstrates the great superiority of the people's communes. Before communization, Shaanxi had very few agricultural machines. The province had a total of twenty-one tractor stations and more than two hundred tractors. At present, the number of tractor stations in the province has also increased to one hundred and fifty-five, with seven hundred and thirty-nine tractors, an increase of more than two and a half times compared to before communization, and the number of large tractor-drawn sowing machines has increased nearly five times.
    The large-scale use of various sowing machines for sowing wheat has not only expanded the area of dense planting, but also greatly improved the quality of wheat sowing, reduced the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows, and also promoted garden-style farming. At present, many wheat fields in the province sown with sowing machines have achieved garden-style farming.
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, October 22nd) Winter wheat planting in Shanxi Province has been a complete success, with a planting area of 15.66 million mu, completing 98% of the plan, an increase of 2 million mu compared to last year.
    The quality of wheat planting this year is unprecedentedly good. The average fertilizer application per mu in wheat fields throughout the province is 85 dan, an increase of more than 20 dan compared to last year. Autumn plowing in wheat fields has generally achieved both extensive plowing and deep plowing, with more than 11 million mu undergoing deep plowing. Early-stubble wheat fields generally undergo three plowings and four harrowings, while returned-stubble wheat generally undergo two plowings and three harrowings, an increase of one plowing and one harrowing compared to previous years. At the same time, the area of irrigated wheat fields has been expanded by 1 million mu.
    Following closely on the heels of the wheat planting upsurge, a high tide of field management has been launched in rural areas everywhere. In order to truly achieve full ridges and full seedlings, a general campaign of checking seedlings and replanting seedlings has been launched. Many areas are determined to achieve "no broken ridges per mu, no missing seedlings per ridge," and "ten percent seedlings this year, ten percent harvest next year." They have organized professional teams for checking and replanting seedlings to check, inspect, and replant as seedlings emerge, ensuring that all corners of the land are checked and replanted without omission. To date, replanting has been carried out in 570,000 mu of wheat fields throughout the province, accounting for 73% of the total area of wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken ridges. Most areas are now applying top dressing and watering.
    The excellent situation in autumn planting in Shanxi Province is emerging after local areas have conscientiously studied and implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This year, various localities have opposed rightist tendencies, boosted their spirits, and fully utilized the superiority of the unified leadership and unified arrangement of the people's communes, which not only ensured that the winter wheat planting period this year was shortened by about half a month compared to last year, and the phenomenon of planting wheat after "frost fall" was eliminated for the first time. At the same time, the area of wheat fields in the province that has reached the standard of garden-style farming has reached 2.25 million mu, an increase of three and a half times compared to last year.

    定叫明年小麦超今年
    北方主要产麦区社社争上游冬播又多又快又好
    本报讯　北方主要产麦区乘夏收之胜秋收之捷，鼓足干劲，大抓冬种，力争明年继续大跃进。目前，山东、河南、陕西、山西等四省小麦播种全面告捷。
    今年，这四省在八中全会决议精神鼓舞下，小麦播种完成得又快又多又好。据统计，山东完成麦播任务百分之八十七点二，比去年扩大一千八百四十万亩。河南完成百分之九十二以上，许多地方已超额完成计划。陕西已播种小麦二千一百一十多万亩，两千万亩已经出苗，一片碧绿。山西比去年扩大二百万亩，已完成百分之九十八。今年，这四省都认真贯彻了“八字宪法”，并注意培植大面积丰产方，力争明年超今年。
    本报济南22日电　山东省今年冬小麦播种工作进行得又多又快又好。到本月17日为止，全省七千万亩冬麦播种任务已完成了87.2％。
    今年，山东省冬小麦播种面积比去年扩大了一千八百四十万亩。播种时间和进度也比去年提前了十天到半月。目前全省三千多万亩早茬麦苗，已经盘墩倒股，遍野碧绿。各地晚茬麦种得更是细致。
    山东省冬小麦播种工作是全省人民在党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，更高地举起了总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，并且在全省范围内开展了夺取明年小麦更大丰收的社会主义劳动竞赛。种麦运动开始，就有寿张等九个县、历城东郊等五个人民公社、寿张台前公社台前大队等十三个大队分别向全省各县、社、队倡议开展小麦丰产竞赛，此后，全省很快就有八十多个县市，一千多个公社，一万多个生产队响应和参加这个竞赛。为了保证把麦种好，全省一千万秋种大军和数十万干部都吃住在田间，田野里战篷林立，白天红旗招展，夜晚灯火辉煌，人们为了夺取明年更大丰收，所向无敌。
    现在山东各地都开始进行查苗、补苗、治虫、追肥等麦田管理工作。
    本报郑州22日电　河南省小麦播种基本结束。
    到20日统计，河南省秋播面积已达七千二百多万亩，占秋冬播种计划90.4％。其中播种小麦六千二百五十二万亩，完成麦播任务92％以上，进度快的开封、新乡两专区，都大大超额完成了小麦播种计划。
    河南省今年各地麦播比往年普遍提前十天到半个月，绝大部分麦田都做到了深翻。全省秋耕地（包括已经播种的在内）已达七千九百四十多万亩，其中将近80％深翻八寸以上，大大超过了省委原计划深翻四千万亩的指标。施底肥面积七千四百六十多万亩，每亩平均施肥量达到八千五百斤左右。今年平整土地也非常好。据各地规划，今年丰产方面积一般都占20％—25％。
    在麦播期间，秋旱继续扩大。和夏季干旱鏖战了八、九十天的两千多万农业大军，都人不解甲、马不卸鞍，立即投入了抗旱种麦高潮中。截至20日统计，全省麦田抗旱播种的达二千一百二十五万多亩。在抗旱种麦中，根据边建设、边使用的方针，全省还抽出三百多万劳力，大搞水利建设，10月份以来，就改善和新扩大灌溉面积一千多万亩。
    现在，全省还有一千多万亩晚茬麦正在抢时播种，保证晚茬赶早茬。麦苗已经出土的地区，正转入苗期管理，大浇压根水，大施压根肥，查苗补块，做到亩亩全苗，无一寸断垅。
    本报西安22日电　陕西省今年用各种播种机播种的小麦比去年大量增加，播种质量良好。目前，全省包括用其他农具播种的两千万亩小麦已经出苗，一片嫩绿。
    今年，全省计划播种小麦二千五百万亩，比去年增长14％。到10月18日，全省已播种二千一百一十多万亩，其中用拖拉机牵引和畜力牵引播种机播种的面积达八百多万亩。预计今年全省的机播面积可以超过一千万亩，达到麦田总面积的一半左右。主要的产麦区关中平原，由于土地肥沃，地势平坦，机播面积增长的幅度特别大。如韩城县今年的机播面积比去年增长一倍；咸阳市的机播面积占麦田总面积的80％；蒲城县占66％。
    机播面积大量增长的事实，又一次显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。公社化前陕西的农业机械很少，全省共有二十一个拖拉机站，二百多台拖拉机。目前全省拖拉机站也已发展到一百五十五个，有拖拉机七百三十九台，比公社化前增长了二倍半以上，机引大型播种机增长近五倍。
    大量运用各种播种机播种小麦，不仅扩大了密植播种的面积，而且大大提高了小麦播种的质量，减少了缺苗断条现象，同时也促进了园田化。目前，全省许多用播种机播种的麦田，都已实现了园田化。
    本报太原22日电　山西省冬小麦播种工作全面告捷，播种面积已达一千五百六十六万亩，完成计划的98％，比去年扩大了二百万亩。
    今年小麦播种质量空前的好。全省麦田平均每亩施肥八十五担，比去年增加了二十多担。麦田秋耕普遍作到了普耕和深耕双管齐下，有一千一百多万亩进行了深耕。正茬麦田一般作到三犁四耙，回茬小麦一般作到两犁三耙，比往年增加了一犁一耙，同时扩大了水地麦田一百万亩。
    紧接着种麦高潮之后，各地农村又掀起了田间管理高潮。为了切实做到垅满苗全，普遍展开查苗补苗活动。许多地区决心做到“亩不断一垅、垅不缺一苗”、“今年十成苗、明年十成收”，组织了查苗补苗专业队，随出苗，随检查，随补种，所有地角地边地头都查补不漏。到目前为止，全省已在五十七万亩麦田里进行了补苗，占有缺苗断垅现象的麦田总数的73％。大部分地区现在正在追肥浇水。
    山西省秋种工作的大好形势，是在各地认真学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议以后出现的。今年，各地反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发挥了人民公社统一领导、统一安排的优越性，不仅保证今年冬小麦播种期比去年缩短了半月左右，首次消灭了“霜降”以后种麦现象。同时全省达到耕作园田化标准的麦田已有二百二十五万亩，比去年扩大了三倍半。
