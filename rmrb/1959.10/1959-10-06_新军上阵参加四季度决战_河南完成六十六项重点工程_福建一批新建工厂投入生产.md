Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th. Henan Province's construction workers fought hard in August and September, victoriously realizing the plan to present gifts for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. The province originally planned sixty gift projects, but actually completed sixty-six. In addition, the one hundred and forty-six gift projects arranged by various special districts, cities, and departments were also completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. Now, the relevant departments in Henan Province have decided, on the basis of successfully completing the gift projects, to concentrate efforts in the fourth quarter to build seventy-six key projects in order to ensure the early and overfulfillment of the province's basic construction tasks.

These gift projects are mostly key projects above the quota, which can increase the production of raw materials, materials, fuels, and electricity. Their early completion can not only guarantee the completion of the province's production increase and conservation plan for this year, but also, after this year's production adjustment and trial production stage, will prepare good conditions for the continued leap forward next year.

The rapid completion and commissioning of these key projects is the result of Henan Province's basic construction front conscientiously implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Like the Three Gate Gorge dam concrete pouring task, Zhengzhou Cable Factory's 16,000 square meter metalworking workshop, Anyang Iron and Steel Company's converter workshop with an annual output of 60,000 tons of steel, Luoyang Thermal Power Plant's 25,000 kilowatt generator unit, Pingdingshan Mining Bureau's No. 7 mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons, Hebi Mining Bureau's Zhangzhuang mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons and Zhangliugou mine with an annual output of 210,000 tons, Luoyang Textile Factory's 10,000 spindles of fine spinning workshop, the final project of the Zhengzhou-Lijiazhai railway double track, and the Zhaopingtai Reservoir, which can intercept 677 million cubic meters of floodwater, were all completed five to fifteen days ahead of schedule under the call to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, and ensure that key projects are presented as gifts for National Day, with good project quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 5th. A large number of newly built and expanded factories in Fujian Province have recently been put into production one after another.

Among the iron and steel industry projects completed ahead of schedule and put into production are the Sanming Iron and Steel Plant's No. 1 blast furnace with a volume of 255 cubic meters; the Fuzhou "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel and 45,000 tons of steel products; and eight small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 to 28 cubic meters.

In terms of the power industry, the first phase of the Sanming Thermal Power Plant, the expansion project of the Fuzhou Power Plant, and the affiliated power plants of the Quanzhou Power Plant and the Houmen Sugar Factory have been put into production ahead of schedule. They can generate 96 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is fifteen times more than the peak power generation in the province before liberation, and more than 39 million kilowatt-hours more than the total annual power generation in the province in 1957. In many mountainous areas, batches of small power stations have also been put into production before National Day. These small power stations with a power generation capacity of 40 to 100 kilowatts have added cheap power for the development of industrial and agricultural production in mountainous areas. In terms of the chemical industry, the Fuzhou Antibiotic Factory, the Fuzhou No. 1 Chemical Factory, and a batch of newly built workshops in chemical factories have been put into production ahead of schedule.

In terms of light industry, a batch of newly built salt farms, small sugar refineries, paper mills, cigarette factories, etc., have also been put into production one after another.

    新军上阵参加四季度决战
    河南完成六十六项重点工程
    福建一批新建工厂投入生产
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省建筑业职工大战8、9月，胜利实现了向建国十周年献礼的计划。全省原定六十项献礼工程，实际完成了六十六项；另外各专区、市和各厅局自行安排的一百四十六项献礼工程，也都按期或提前竣工。现在河南省有关部门决定在胜利完成献礼工程的基础上，在第四季度再突击建成七十六项重点工程，以保证提前超额完成全省的基本建设任务。
    这些献礼工程，多数是限额以上的，能增产原料、材料、燃料和电力的重点工程。它们的提前建成，不仅能够保证完成全省今年的增产节约计划，而且经过今年的生产调整和试生产阶段，将为明年的继续跃进准备下良好的条件。
    这些重点工程的迅速建成和投入生产，是河南省基本建设战线认真贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议的结果。像三门峡大坝混凝土浇筑任务，郑州电缆厂一万六千平方米的金工车间，安阳钢铁公司年产六万吨钢的转炉车间，洛阳热电厂二万五千瓩的发电机组，平顶山矿务局年产九十万吨的七号矿，鹤壁矿务局年产三十万吨和二十一万吨的张庄矿与张六沟矿，洛阳纺织厂细纺车间的一万纱锭，郑州至李家寨铁路复线的收尾工程，以及可以拦蓄洪水六亿七千七百万立方米的昭平台水库等，在反右倾、鼓干劲、保证重点向国庆献礼的号召下，都提前五天至十五天完成了献礼任务，工程质量良好。
    据新华社福州5日电　福建省大批新建和扩建的工厂在最近纷纷投入生产。
    提前建成并投入生产的钢铁工业工程项目中，有三明钢铁厂的二百五十五立方米的一号高炉；有年产五万吨钢、四万五千吨钢材的福州八一钢铁厂；还有八座八到二十八立方米的小高炉。
    在电力工业方面提前投入生产的有三明热电厂一期工程、福州发电厂扩建工程，以及泉州电厂和后门糖厂的附属电厂。它们每年能发电九千六百万度，比解放前全省最高峰发电量还多十五倍，比1957年全省全年发电量的总和还多三千九百多万度。在许多山区，成批的小型发电站也在国庆节前夕投入生产。这些发电能力为四十至一百多瓩的小型发电站，为山区发展工农业生产增添了廉价的动力。在化学工业方面，提前投入生产的有福州抗菌素厂，福州第一化工厂，以及一批化工厂的新建车间。
    在轻工业方面，一批新建的盐场、小型糖厂、纸厂、卷烟厂等，也都陆续投入生产。
