Xinhua News Agency, 21st. Comrade Nozaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and head of the Japanese Communist Party delegation, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio address to the Japanese people on the evening of the 20th. The full text of the speech is as follows:

To everyone in Japan:

I am Nozaka from the Japanese Communist Party. This time, when the People's Republic of China celebrated its tenth anniversary, we were invited by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to visit China.

Today, our Japanese Communist Party delegation and the Chinese Communist Party delegation issued a joint statement. The Communist Parties of Japan and China also issued a joint statement in March of this year. This time, based on the development of the international situation since the last statement, we further discussed the relations between the two countries and the relations between the two Communist Parties, and the opinions were completely unanimous. In the current international situation, especially in the situation related to Japan and China, this joint statement has great significance.

Fourteen years ago, that is, until the autumn of the year the war ended, I lived in Yan'an, a mountainous area in Shaanxi Province in northwestern China, for nearly six years. There, I shared weal and woe with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, living in cave dwellings, leading an almost self-sufficient life, and fighting against Japanese imperialism's invasion of China.

This time, after our Communist Party delegation participated in the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China held in Beijing, we visited Yan'an and visited various parts of China, and we felt deeply moved. For example, when we went to Yan'an, we saw that Yan'an, which had been almost turned into ruins due to the destruction by the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek's troops, had been built into new streets, and modern factories had also been established. At that time, it was not easy to get even candles, but today, electric lights illuminate the city of Yan'an, and energetic people welcomed us.

Recalling the scene fourteen years ago, seeing the prosperous scene of China today, I feel like I am in a dream.

China is now in the midst of a great leap forward in socialist construction. The backward China, which had no decent industry in the past, is now being transformed into a modern industrial country. Steel production this year will reach the level of Japan. The Chinese people are producing jet planes and machine tools in large quantities with their own hands.

Going to the countryside, the peasants who had lived almost like slaves not long ago have become masters of the country together with the workers, and now they have established people's communes, living a stable life, and making a great leap forward in agricultural production.

It is truly amazing that China, with a population of 650 million, has no unemployed people. Of course, there are no beggars either. Those who are able to work are guaranteed work, and the elderly, children, and those who have lost their ability to work are guaranteed a life. People who are familiar with China's former dirty streets can no longer recognize today's clean streets.

The celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The Great Hall of the People, facing Tiananmen Square, is a large building with a hall that can accommodate 10,000 people, a banquet hall that can accommodate 5,000 people, and many halls. In order to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people completed this marble palace from design to interior decoration in just ten months. In contrast, the Japanese Diet Building took nearly twenty years to build. From this comparison, one can imagine the rapid speed of socialist construction in China.

In the great leap forward of socialist construction, the Chinese people are advancing forward with full confidence and vigor.

The amazing development of the new China that I have said above is due to the fact that China has become a socialist country.

Wherever I traveled in China, I could see that the Chinese people sincerely hoped to be friendly with the Japanese people and eagerly hoped to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible. The Japanese people also sincerely hope to be friendly with the Chinese people and to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible. Nevertheless, more than fourteen years have passed since the end of the war, and today the two countries have not yet restored diplomatic relations, which is completely unnatural and unreasonable.

So, who is hindering the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China? Needless to say, it is due to the politics of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is succumbing to the United States, colluding with the United States, and adopting a policy of hostility towards China.

However, recently, among the Japanese people, public opinion demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and holding the Kishi Nobusuke government accountable is becoming increasingly strong. Therefore, Prime Minister Kishi is desperately declaring that they are not implementing a policy of hostility towards China, and saying that they are taking a "wait-and-see" attitude, etc. This statement is truly shameless. Since the establishment of the Kishi Cabinet, Kishi Nobusuke's remarks and actions of hostility towards China have been well known, and I do not need to list them one by one here.

At present, the Kishi Cabinet is negotiating with the United States on revising the Security Treaty, which is the most blatant policy of hostility towards China. As you all know, revising the Security Treaty is to strengthen the open U.S.-Japan military alliance that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union. This means pointing the gun at China. If this is not a policy of hostility towards China, then what is it?

As long as the Kishi Cabinet continues to adopt this policy, China will not be able to cooperate well with the Japanese government.

The responsibility for obstructing the friendship between the people of Japan and China and the restoration of diplomatic relations should be entirely borne by the Japanese government. The joint statement of the Communist Parties of Japan and China issued today also clearly pointed out that as long as the Japanese government abandons its policy of hostility towards China, the Sino-Japanese trade that the Japanese people and Japanese capitalists hope for will develop normally, and cultural exchanges between the two countries will also be able to develop smoothly.

The normalization of relations between Japan and China and the cooperation between the people of the two countries are not only very beneficial to the people of the two countries, but also very beneficial to the peace of Asia and the world. From this point of view, we Japanese people must resolutely stop the Kishi Cabinet's conspiracy to revise the Security Treaty, and further abolish the Security Treaty. As clearly pointed out by the Tokyo District Court's judgment on the Sunagawa Incident, the Security Treaty violates the Japanese Constitution. Because of this Security Treaty, U.S. troops are stationed in Japan - the territory, territorial waters, and airspace of our motherland are controlled by the U.S. military. Moreover, the United States controls the political and economic lifeline of Japan, and the Japanese people are suffering from all kinds of hardships and humiliations. Not only that, if the Security Treaty is revised, then Japan will also have to bear the obligation to participate in U.S. military operations. At that time, Japan may be dragged into a nuclear war planned by the United States at any time.

It is only natural that the Japanese people feel extremely uneasy about revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Now, the struggle of a wide range of people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, intellectuals, citizens, women, youth, and students, against revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is rising. Joint struggle organizations including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to stop the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty are becoming popular in urban and rural areas throughout the country. With the rise of the people's movement, insightful people within the conservative forces are also increasingly expressing dissatisfaction and opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policy of revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Not only in Japan, the people of China and the Soviet Union go without saying, the foreigners we met in China, especially the people of Asian countries, feel great unease about Japan once again becoming an aggressive militarist country, and are very concerned about revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. They very much hope that we Japanese people can stop the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and have great expectations for our Japanese people's struggle. If the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is revised and the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance is further strengthened, Japan will become an orphan in Asia.

At present, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is very anxious. They and the United States are trying to sign a new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty this year, and require Congress to approve it in early next year. The situation surrounding the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has now entered a serious stage. These one or two months are the most important moment. Let the people of the whole country unite to stop the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. First of all, stop the signing that the U.S. and Japanese governments are about to carry out. Despite different political views, different parties supported, and different organizations belonged to, patriotic people who demand national independence and love peace should unite closely and resolutely fight to stop the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

Compatriots of the motherland! Fight resolutely! We will soon return to Japan and fight with everyone!

    日共中央主席野坂参三同志向日本人民发表广播演说
    号召团结起来制止修改日美安全条约
    岸信介内阁敌视中国的政策妨碍了日中邦交的恢复
    中国在工农业生产大跃进中正朝气蓬勃地向前迈进
    新华社21日讯　日本共产党中央委员会主席、日本共产党代表团团长野坂参三同志应中央人民广播电台的邀请，20日晚上在中央人民广播电台向日本人民发表了广播讲话。讲话的全文如下：日本的各位：
    我是日本共产党的野坂，这次当中华人民共和国庆祝建国十周年的时候，我们受到中国共产党中央委员会的邀请，访问了中国。
    今天我们日本共产党代表团和中国共产党代表团发表了联合声明。日中两国的共产党在今年3月间也发表了联合声明，这次根据上次声明以后的国际形势的发展，进一步商讨了两国的关系和两国共产党的关系，意见完全一致。在现在的国际形势中，特别是同日本和中国有关的形势中，这个联合声明具有巨大的意义。
    我在十四年前，也就是一直到战争结束的那一年的秋天为止，在中国西北陕西省山区的延安住了将近六年。在那里，我和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导人同甘共苦，住在窑洞里，过着几乎是自给自足的生活，而对日本帝国主义侵略中国进行了斗争。
    这次我们共产党代表团参加了在北京举行的建国十周年的隆重的庆祝典礼以后，访问了延安，并且参观了中国各地，感受很深。例如到延安一看，过去由于受到日本和蒋介石军队的破坏而几乎变成了废墟的延安，已建设了新的街道，现代化的工厂也建立起来了。在当时连洋蜡都不容易得到手，而今天却是电灯光照耀着延安城，朝气蓬勃的人们欢迎了我们。
    回想起十四年前的情景，看到中国今天欣欣向荣的景象，我觉得好像在梦境里。
    中国现在正处在社会主义建设的大跃进当中，过去连像样的工业都没有的、落后的中国，现在正在变为现代化的工业国家。钢铁生产今年将达到日本的水平。中国人民用他们的双手大批地生产着喷气式飞机和机床。
    到农村去一看，不久以前还过着近乎奴隶般生活的农民，已经和工人一起成为国家的主人，现在建立了人民公社，过着安定的生活，使农业生产大跃进。
    具有六亿五千万人口的中国竟没有失业者，这真是令人惊奇的。当然，也没有乞丐，有劳动能力的，工作得到保证，对于老人和小孩以及丧失劳动能力的，生活都有保证。熟悉中国以前肮脏的街道的人们看到今天清洁的街道，他们已认不出来了。
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的典礼，是在北京人民大会堂举行的。面对着天安门广场的人民大会堂是一个拥有可以容纳一万人的大礼堂、可以容纳五千人的宴会厅以及许多大厅的大建筑物。中国人民为了迎接建国十周年，从设计到内部装饰在仅仅十个月的时间内，完成了这座用大理石筑成的大宫殿。而日本国会议事堂却花了将近二十年的时间才建完，相比之下可以想像中国社会主义建设速度的飞快。
    在社会主义建设的大跃进中，中国人民满怀信心，朝气蓬勃地向前迈进。
    上面我所说的新中国的惊人的发展，就是由于中国已经成为社会主义的国家。
    我在中国各地旅行到处都可以看到，中国人民衷心希望同日本人民友好亲善并且热望早日恢复中日两国的邦交。日本人民也衷心希望同中国人民友好亲善并且早日恢复日中两国的邦交。尽管如此，大战结束以后已经过了十四年多，今天两国邦交还没有恢复，这完全是不自然的，不合理的。
    那么，究竟是谁在妨碍日本和中国的邦交的恢复呢？这不用说，是由于岸信介内阁的政治，岸信介内阁屈从于美国，和美国勾结在一起，采取敌视中国的政策。
    但是最近以来，在日本人民中间，要求恢复日中邦交，对岸信介政府追究责任的舆论是愈来愈强烈了。因此，岸首相拼命声明，他们并没有执行敌视中国的政策，又说什么采取“静观”的态度等等。这种说法真是恬不知耻。自从岸内阁成立以来，岸信介敌视中国的言论和行动，是大家共知的，我在这里不必一一列举。
    目前，岸内阁正同美国进行关于修改安全保障条约的谈判，这就是最露骨的敌视中国的政策。各位也知道，修改安全保障条约就是为了加强以中苏为敌的公开的日美军事同盟。这也就是说把枪口对准中国。如果说这不是敌视中国的政策，那又是什么呢？
    只要岸内阁继续采取这种政策，那么中国是不可能和日本政府很好地合作的。
    阻挠日中两国人民的友好和邦交的恢复的责任，完全应该由日本政府负责。今天发表的日中两国共产党的联合声明也明确地指出了，只要日本政府放弃敌视中国的政策，那么日本人民和日本的资本家所希望的日中贸易就会正常地开展，两国之间的文化交流也能够顺利地发展。
    日中两国关系的正常化和两国人民的携手合作，不仅是对两国人民十分有利，同时对于亚洲和世界的和平也是非常有利的。就从这一点意义来讲，我们日本人民无论如何要坚决地制止岸内阁修改安全保障条约的阴谋，进而废弃安全保障条约。正如东京地方法院对砂川事件的判决中所清楚地指出的，安全保障条约是违反日本宪法的。由于这个安全保障条约，美国驻军在日本——我们祖国的领土、领海和领空被控制在美军手里。而且美国控制了日本的政治、经济的命脉，日本人民遭受着种种的苦难和屈辱。不仅如此，如果修改了安全保障条约，那么，日本还要担负参加美国的军事行动的义务。到那时候，日本任何时候都有可能被卷进美国策划的原子战争中。
    日本人民对于修改日美安全保障条约感到极大的不安，这是理所当然的。现在，以工人为首的、包括农民、知识分子、市民、妇女、青年、学生在内的广泛的各阶层人民反对修改日美安全条约的斗争日益高涨。包括共产党、社会党在内的制止修改、争取废除日美安全保障条约的共同斗争组织正普及全国各地的城乡。随着人民的运动的高涨，保守势力内部有识之士也越来越对岸信介内阁修改日美安全保障条约的方针表示不满和反对。不仅是日本国内，中国和苏联的人民固不待言，我们在中国会见的外国人特别是亚洲各国的人民，对日本再一次成为侵略性的军国主义国家感到很大的不安，并且对于修改日美安全保障条约十分关心。他们非常希望我们日本人民能够阻止修改日美安全保障条约的阴谋，并且对于我们日本人民的斗争抱着很大的期望。如果修改了日美安全保障条约，侵略性的日美军事同盟进一步加强，日本更将成为亚洲的孤儿。
    目前，岸信介内阁很焦急。他们同美国企图在今年内签署新的日美安全条约，并且在明年年初要求国会批准。围绕着修改日美安全保障条约的局势，现在已经进入严重阶段。这一两个月是最重要的时刻，让全国人民以团结的力量来阻止修改日美安全保障条约。首先阻止日美政府将要进行的签署。尽管政治见解不同，所支持的党派不同，所属的团体不同，但是爱国的、要求民族独立的、爱好和平的人们应该紧紧地团结起来，坚决地为阻止修改、争取废除日美安全保障条约而斗争。
    祖国的同胞们！坚决奋斗吧！我们不久也将回到日本，同大家一起斗争！
