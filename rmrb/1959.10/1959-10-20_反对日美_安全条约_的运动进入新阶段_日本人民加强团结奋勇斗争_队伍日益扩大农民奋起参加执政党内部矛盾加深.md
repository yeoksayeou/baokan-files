Xinhua News Agency, October 19th – Our correspondent reports: The Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has lasted for a year since the U.S.-Japan reactionaries began negotiations on October 8th last year. Over the past year, this movement to strive for independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy has flourished, and its scale has now surpassed last year's movement against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," which achieved a major victory. The "Security Treaty" issue has become the focus of the struggle between two paths: the democratic forces of Japan and the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

A notable feature of the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" is the extensiveness of the movement. Currently, all forty-six prefectures in Japan have established joint struggle organizations that include the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and mass organizations from all walks of life. In cities, towns, and villages below the prefectural level, more than three hundred such joint struggle organizations have been established. Under the unified leadership of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," which consists of more than one hundred forty mass organizations and progressive political parties, these joint struggle organizations have formed a broad united front against the "Security Treaty." Since April 5th of this year, people from all walks of life in Japan have held six large-scale unified actions against the "Security Treaty" nationwide. In each unified action, millions of people held rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and class boycotts in hundreds of cities and regions. The Japanese people's resolute struggle has forced Nobusuke Kishi to postpone the date of signing the new "Security Treaty" four times.

The Japanese Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of the struggle, uniting all democratic forces and promoting the development of the movement. The Japanese Communist Party has called on the Japanese people to strengthen their joint struggle and strive to build a national democratic united front.

As more and more people recognize the dangerous conspiracy of Nobusuke Kishi to revise the "Security Treaty," the ranks of the movement against the "Security Treaty" are growing, absorbing people from a wide range of social strata. In recent developments, it is particularly significant that this struggle movement has begun to mobilize rural areas, which are more tightly controlled by conservative political parties. The largest nationwide farmers' organization in Japan, the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, recently passed a resolution at its national congress stating that "Japanese farmers must unite with workers to launch a struggle to prevent the revision of the Security Treaty until Japan's peace, democracy, and independence can be ensured." Representatives of farmers and workers from ten prefectures in the Tohoku and Hokuriku regions took the lead in establishing the Ten Prefecture Worker-Farmer Joint Struggle Conference on October 5th. Currently, the establishment of such joint struggle organizations is also brewing in rural areas in other regions. Japanese farmers will also hold a national conference against the "Security Treaty" in November. It is believed that with the rise of Japanese farmers, who account for 40% of the national population, the Japanese struggle against the "Security Treaty" will be further strengthened.

Moreover, the struggle against the "Security Treaty" has also extended to the bourgeoisie. The National Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations, with eighty thousand small business owners, recently passed a resolution stating that they want to stand with workers and farmers to oppose the U.S.-Japan "security system" that hinders the prosperity of their enterprises.

In the past year's struggle, the Nobusuke Kishi government has used various despicable means such as threats, slanders, and suppression in an attempt to undermine the movement against the "Security Treaty." However, their conspiracies have met with shameful failure. The people have responded with greater unity and greater resistance. For example, the Nobusuke Kishi government once attempted to obstruct the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese Mothers' Conference from discussing the issue of opposing the "Security Treaty." As a result, both conferences not only passed resolutions and declarations firmly opposing the "Security Treaty," but also, before the World Conference, the Japanese people held a large-scale march against the "Security Treaty" and nuclear armament, in which more than ten million people participated, traversing six thousand three hundred kilometers of mountains and rivers. The number of participants in the march was ten times the number of participants in last year's peace march. This fully demonstrates the Japanese people's heroic and unyielding fighting will and the irresistible trend of the movement against the "Security Treaty."

Due to the influence of the development of the people's struggle, the contradictions within the Japanese ruling party surrounding the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" are also deepening. People from the "anti-mainstream" faction, such as Ichiro Kono, Tanzan Ishibashi, and Takeo Miki-Kenzō Matsumura, have expressed dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's actions. Nobusuke Kishi has so far failed to unify the divisions within the party. With Ishibashi's visit to China and the relaxation of the international situation, those who are dissatisfied with Nobusuke Kishi are gathering strength and brewing an anti-Kishi movement.

However, the Nobusuke Kishi clique is unwilling to give up. It has basically reached an agreement with the United States in its negotiations and is now strengthening measures to undermine the movement against the "Security Treaty" in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to sign a new treaty within this year. Therefore, the struggle against the "Security Treaty" has begun to enter a new and serious stage. The heroic and unyielding Japanese people are about to hold their seventh unified action on October 20th and have decided to continue holding the eighth and ninth national unified actions. Cultural figures have also actively launched a movement to counter the deceptive propaganda of the Nobusuke Kishi government. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with three million six hundred thousand members, has also decided to hold a general strike to fight the Nobusuke Kishi government to the end. The domestic and international situation is conducive to the Japanese people's struggle. The Japanese people are confidently strengthening their unity, expanding their ranks, and persisting in their struggle.

### 反对日美“安全条约”的运动进入新阶段  日本人民加强团结奋勇斗争  队伍日益扩大农民奋起参加执政党内部矛盾加深

　　反对日美“安全条约”的运动进入新阶段
    日本人民加强团结奋勇斗争
    队伍日益扩大农民奋起参加执政党内部矛盾加深
    新华社19日讯　本社记者报道：日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争自从去年10月8日美日反动派开始谈判以来，到现在已经持续了一年之久。一年来，这一争取独立、和平、中立、民主的运动蓬勃发展，现在规模已经超过了去年取得重大胜利的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的运动。“安全条约”问题已经成为日本民主力量同美日反动派之间两条道路斗争的焦点。
    日本人民反对“安全条约”斗争的显著特点是运动的广泛性。现在，日本全国四十六个都道府县全部成立了包括日本共产党、社会党和各界群众团体的联合斗争组织，在县以下的市、镇、村里，这种联合斗争组织已经建立了三百多个。这些联合斗争组织在全国一百四十多个群众团体和进步政党组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的统一领导下，形成了反对“安全条约”的广泛的统一战线。从今年4月5日开始，日本各阶层人民在全国范围内共举行了六次规模浩大的反对“安全条约”统一行动。在每次统一行动中都有数百万人在数百个城市和地区举行了集会、游行、罢工、罢课等。日本人民的坚决斗争，已经迫使岸信介四次推迟签订新的“安全条约”的日期。
    日本共产党始终站在斗争的最前列，并且团结着所有民主力量，推动着运动的发展。日本共产党号召日本人民加强联合斗争，并为建立民族民主统一战线而奋斗。
    由于越来越多的人认识了岸信介修改“安全条约”的危险阴谋，反对“安全条约”运动的队伍日益壮大，吸收了广泛阶层的人民。在最近的发展中，特别有着重要意义的是，这个斗争运动已经开始推动保守政党控制较严的农村。日本最大的全国性农民组织——全日本农民协会联合会不久前在全国代表大会上通过决议表示：“日本农民要同工人们联合起来，展开阻止修改安全条约的斗争，直到能够确保日本的和平、民主、独立的时候为止”。东北和北陆地方十个县的农民和工人代表在10月5日率先成立了十县工农联合斗争会议。现在这种联合斗争组织也正在其他地区的农村酝酿成立中。日本农民还将在11月举行全国性反对“安全条约”大会。可以相信，随着占全国人口40％的日本农民的奋起，日本反对“安全条约”的斗争将进一步壮大。
    不仅如此，反对“安全条约”的斗争还扩展到资产阶级内部。有八万名小工商业主参加的全国商工团体联合会最近通过决议，表示要同工人、农民一起，反对阻碍他们的企业繁荣的日美“安全体系”。
    在一年来的斗争中，岸信介政府曾经施用威胁、诬蔑、镇压等各种卑鄙手段企图破坏反对“安全条约”运动。但是它们的阴谋都遭到了可耻的失败。人民回答他们的是更大的团结和更大的反抗。例如，岸信介政府曾经企图阻挠禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会和日本母亲大会讨论反对“安全条约”问题。结果，两个大会不仅都通过了坚决反对“安全条约”的决议和宣言，而且在世界大会前，日本人民还举行了共有一千多万人参加、共跋涉山川六千三百公里的反对“安全条约”和核武装的大游行。参加游行人数等于去年和平游行人数的十倍。这充分表示了日本人民英勇不屈的斗争意志和反对“安全条约”运动的不可阻挡的趋势。
    由于人民斗争发展的影响，日本执政党内部围绕修改“安全条约”问题的矛盾也在加深。“反主流派”中的河野一郎、石桥湛山、三木武夫—松村谦三等派人士都对岸信介的作法表示不满。岸信介直到如今未能统一党内分歧。随着石桥访华和国际形势的缓和，不满岸信介的人们正在集结力量，酝酿反岸运动。
    但是，岸信介集团死不甘心。它同美国的谈判已经基本达成协议，现在正在加强破坏反对“安全条约”运动的措施，企图实现在今年内签订新条约的阴谋。因而，反对“安全条约”的斗争开始进入新的严重阶段。英勇不屈的日本人民即将在10月20日举行第七次统一行动，并且决定要继续举行第八、第九次全国统一行动。文化界人士也积极展开了反击岸信介政府欺骗宣传的运动。拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会还决定要举行总罢工，同岸信介政府斗争到底。国内外形势有利于日本人民的斗争，日本人民正在信心百倍地加强团结，扩大队伍，坚持斗争。
