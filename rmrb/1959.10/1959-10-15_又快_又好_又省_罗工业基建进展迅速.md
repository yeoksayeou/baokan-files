Fast, Good, and Economical

Rapid Progress in Romanian Industrial Infrastructure

    This paper, Bucharest, 14th—Romania's national industrial infrastructure construction is accelerating under the slogan of "fast, good, and economical." The total industrial investment for this year is 17.4 billion lei (Romanian currency), an increase of 15% compared to 1958.

    Projects that have been completed and put into production this year include a steel rolling workshop with an annual output of 550,000 tons of steel and a coking oven with an annual output of 210,000 tons at the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, three Martin furnaces and a large workshop for manufacturing diesel locomotives at the Reșița United Factory, and a synthetic fiber factory in Săvinești with an annual output of 2,000 tons.

    Three thermal power plants have been newly built and expanded this year, increasing the total generating capacity by 125,000 kilowatts. The "Lenin" hydroelectric power station is installing power generating equipment and will be partially put into production next year. A thermal power plant is currently being built in Ploiești, and a thermal power plant with a larger generating capacity than the "Lenin" hydroelectric power station is also planned to be built in Craiova. Electricity networks are being built in the northern and northwestern regions of the country this year. By next year, these power grids will be integrated into the national power system.

    罗工业基建进展迅速
    本报布加勒斯特14日电　罗马尼亚全国的工业基本建设正在“快、好、省”的口号下加速进行。今年工业总投资为一百七十四亿列伊（罗币），比1958年增加15％。
    在今年内已经建成并投入生产的工程有胡乃道拉冶金联合企业一个年产五十五万吨钢材的轧钢车间、年产二十一万吨的炼焦炉，累希察联合工厂的三座马丁炉和一个制造柴油机车的大型车间、年产二千吨的塞维内斯蒂合成纤维厂等等。
    今年已新建和扩建了三个火力发电厂，增加的发电能力共计十二万五千瓩。“列宁”水电站已在安装发电设备，明年可部分投入生产。目前正在普洛耶什蒂建立一个火电站，还准备在克拉约瓦建立一个发电能力比“列宁”水电站更大的火电站。今年正在国家北部和西北部地区建立电力网。到明年这些电力网将纳入全国电力系统。
