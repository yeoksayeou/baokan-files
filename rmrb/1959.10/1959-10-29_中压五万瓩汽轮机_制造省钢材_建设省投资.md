    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Telegram: The first domestically designed medium-pressure 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine was successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory in early October.
    Compared with high-pressure steam turbines, this medium-pressure steam turbine has a simpler structure, with eight fewer impellers than a high-pressure steam turbine of the same size. Therefore, it can save 30% to 40% of alloy stainless steel and other steel materials, and the processing time is reduced by about 33% compared with high-pressure steam turbines of the same size. Because this type of steam turbine uses less alloy steel, requires less processing time, and requires fewer auxiliary equipment, using this type of steam turbine to build a power station can save 15% to 20% of the investment compared to using high-pressure equipment.

    中压五万瓩汽轮机
    制造省钢材　建设省投资
    据新华社哈尔滨电　我国自行设计的第一台中压五万瓩汽轮机10月初在哈尔滨汽轮机厂试制成功。
    这台中压汽轮机同高压汽轮机比较，由于结构简单，比同样大的高压汽轮机少八个叶轮，因此可以节省30％到40％的合金不锈钢及其它钢材，加工时间也比同样大的高压汽轮机减少33％左右。由于这种汽轮机用的合金钢少，加工时间少，所需辅助设备较少，所以采用这种汽轮机建设发电站，比采用高压设备可以节省15％到20％的投资。
