Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, after two court sessions, the Casablanca court rejected on the morning of the 29th the demand of the King's prosecutor, representing the Moroccan government, to dissolve the Moroccan Communist Party. In its reasoning for the verdict, the court declared that it had no authority to make decisions on religious matters, and that there was no evidence to prove that the Moroccan Communist Party opposed the monarchy.

The Moroccan government ordered the prohibition of the activities of the Moroccan Communist Party on September 10. On October 8, the Casablanca court began hearing the lawsuit to ban the activities of the Moroccan Communist Party. The King's prosecutor, representing the government, accused the Moroccan Communist Party of "opposing the monarchy and opposing religion," and that the Communist doctrine was "incompatible with Islam."

Communist Party leaders said in court that the Communist Party did not oppose the monarchy, but demanded the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Morocco; moreover, no one could provide any example to prove that the Communist Party opposed Islam. The accusations against the Moroccan Communist Party were groundless.

The Moroccan Communist Party issued a statement on October 15 saying, "No event can change our great mission, which is to unite and organize a wider range of masses in order to fully and completely liberate our country in economic, political and social aspects."

The statement said, "In our country, the King's patriotic actions have earned him a high prestige, which is why we are striving for a constitutional monarchy and including the constitutional monarchy in our party constitution."

The statement pointed out, "Those who attack us and threaten to ban our activities are actually afraid of us. They are afraid of our doctrine, afraid of our loyalty to the national cause and the people's cause. They are afraid of our correct line and the continuous influence of our ideas on the Moroccan working class, some intellectuals and the middle class..."

    摩洛哥法庭判决
    驳回国王解散摩共的要求
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：经过两次开庭审理之后，卡萨布兰卡法庭在29日上午驳回了代表摩洛哥政府的国王的检察官关于解散摩洛哥共产党的要求。法庭在判决理由中宣布，它无权就宗教问题作出决定，同时没有任何证据证明摩洛哥共产党反对君主政体。
    摩洛哥政府是在9月10日下令禁止摩洛哥共产党活动的。10月8日，卡萨布兰卡法庭开始审理禁止摩洛哥共产党活动的诉讼。代表政府出庭的国王的检察官指控摩洛哥共产党“反对君主制、反对宗教”，共产党的学说是“同伊斯兰教不相容的”。
    共产党领导人在法庭上说，共产党并不反对君主政体，而是要求在摩洛哥建立君主立宪政权；此外，没有人能提出任何例证来证明共产党反对伊斯兰教。对摩洛哥共产党提出的控诉毫无根据。
    摩洛哥共产党10月15日曾发表声明说，“没有任何事件能够改变我们伟大的任务，这就是，团结和组织更广泛的群众，以便全部和彻底地在经济、政治和社会等方面解放我们的国家。”
    声明说，“在我们的国家里，国王的爱国行动使他享有很高的威望，这就是为什么我们争取君主立宪制，而把君主立宪制列在我们的党章里。”
    声明指出，“那些攻击我们、威胁要禁止我们活动的人，实际上是害怕我们。他们害怕我们的学说，害怕我们对民族事业和人民事业的忠诚。他们害怕我们正确的路线和我们的思想对摩洛哥劳动阶级、某些知识分子和中产阶级……的不间断的影响。”
