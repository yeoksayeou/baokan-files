Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: The workers in Suzhou and Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, have completed their October leap forward plans ahead of schedule. By the 21st, Suzhou City had exceeded its October total output value plan by 5.88%, and the output and quality of major products had greatly improved compared to September. By the 26th, Wuxi City had completed its entire month's production plan ahead of schedule, with a total output value increase of 34.7% compared to the same period last month.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th: The Second Steelmaking Department of the Daye Steel Plant overfulfilled its October production plan four days and sixteen hours ahead of schedule. From the 1st to the 26th, the daily steel output increased by 6.74% compared to the average daily output in September, which was already a high-yield month. The quality of the steel also significantly improved, with the qualified rate of electric furnace steel ingots reaching 99.38%, creating the highest quality record this year.

The workers in this steelmaking department launched a more enthusiastic competition in October. The Red Flag No. 1 electric furnace, whose representative attended the National Hero Conference, surpassed the No. 6 electric furnace, which had once exceeded it, in the competition, producing one more furnace of steel per day than planned starting from the 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th: The Tianjin Tractor Factory, an advanced collective that attended the National Hero Conference, produced almost half of its first-half output of tractors in October. The factory's October tractor production plan has been completed four days ahead of schedule.

The convening of the National Hero Conference further inspired the enthusiasm of the factory's workers. The testing group of the assembly workshop implemented cross-operations, testing a total of eleven tractors on the 26th, setting a new record for tractor production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th: The Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory, a representative of the advanced collective that attended the National Hero Conference, completed its October production plan on the 24th, with a total output value increase of nearly 30% compared to September. Currently, all factory workers are continuing to deeply engage in a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced models, determined to complete another 25% of the October plan by the end of the month and prepare for November production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th: The Shenyang Fan Factory carried out a mass movement centered on technical demonstration competitions, completing the October national plan comprehensively four days ahead of schedule.

The Shenyang Fan Factory's workers learned from the experiences of the Anshan Iron and Steel Technical Demonstration Competition, resulting in many technical innovation projects and solving many key production problems. From the 11th to the 25th, a total of 2,121 innovation proposals emerged in the factory, and 2,084 were quickly implemented, with an average increase in production efficiency of 46.63%. This rate of growth is unprecedented in the factory's history.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 28th: The workers of the Guangxi Mugui Manganese Mine, an advanced collective that attended the National Hero Conference, had already completed their October manganese ore production task on the 22nd, exceeding it by 4.3%.

When the news that the Mugui Manganese Mine was selected as an advanced collective to attend the Hero Conference was announced, all the mine's workers redoubled their efforts, proposing new leap forward targets. Many work teams guaranteed to complete their monthly plans ahead of schedule and above quota as a gift to the National Hero Conference. More than thirty mining teams in the mine launched a red banner competition for pacesetters, continuously increasing output. Since the middle of the month, the output has been 11.92% higher than the same period in high-yield September.

Currently, all the mine's workers are determined to seize every minute and second to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of this year's total output value plan and the leap forward plan to double output one month ahead of schedule. On this basis, they will transport tens of thousands more tons of manganese ore to support the national and autonomous region's steel industry. (Attached picture)

    十月未终凯歌四起
    苏州、无锡提前完成工业总产值计划
    大冶、天津、沈阳等地一批厂矿报喜讯
    据新华社南京29日电　江苏省苏州、无锡两市职工已提前完成10月份跃进计划。苏州市到21日止，超额5.88％完成了10月份的总产值计划，主要产品的产量、质量都比9月份有很大提高。无锡市到26日止，提前完成了全月生产计划，总产值比上月同期增长34.7％。
    新华社武汉29日电　大冶钢厂第二炼钢部提前四天零十六小时超额完成了10月份的生产计划。1日到26日钢的日产量，比高产的9月份的平均日产水平又提高6.74％，钢的质量也显著提高，其中电炉钢锭合格率达到99.38％，创造今年以来的质量最高纪录。
    这个炼钢部的工人们10月份更加热烈地展开对手竞赛。派了代表出席全国群英会的红旗一号电炉，在对手赛中又赛过了一度超过它的六号电炉，从21日起每天比计划多炼了一炉钢。
    据新华社天津29日电　出席全国群英会的先进集体——天津市拖拉机制造厂，10月份生产的拖拉机差不多相当于上半年产量的一半。全厂10月份的拖拉机生产计划已经提前四天完成。
    全国群英会的召开进一步鼓舞了这个厂职工群众的干劲。装配工段试车组实行交叉作业，在26日一共试完了十一台拖拉机，创造了生产拖拉机以来的最高纪录。
