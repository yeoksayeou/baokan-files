Xinhua News Agency, October 27th, Moscow, October 26th (TASS dispatch): TASS published a communiqué regarding the photos of the far side of the moon taken by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station. The full text is as follows:

The first batch of photos of the far side of the moon, obtained after preliminary processing, will be published in Moscow newspapers on Tuesday, along with necessary explanations. Lunar photography lasted approximately forty minutes, resulting in a large number of lunar photographs.

The processing of the photographic film (development and fixing) was carried out automatically on the interplanetary station.

According to the planned scientific research program, the equipment on the automatic interplanetary station for taking photos of the far side of the moon and transmitting them to Earth began operating at 6:30 AM Moscow time on October 7th.

To photograph the moon, the automatic interplanetary station was equipped with an orientation system and facsimile equipment with automatic film processing capabilities.

The shooting time was chosen when the interplanetary station, orbiting along its trajectory, was located between the moon and the sun, with 70% of the far side of the moon illuminated by the sun. At this time, the interplanetary station was 60,000 to 70,000 kilometers from the surface of the moon.

The orientation system on the automatic interplanetary station issued a special command to align the camera lens of the interplanetary station with the far side of the moon and issued a command to start the camera.

The photography of the moon lasted approximately forty minutes, resulting in a large number of lunar photographs in two sizes.

The processing of the photographic film (development and fixing) was carried out automatically on the interplanetary station.

The transmission of lunar image signals back to Earth was carried out using a specialized radio technology system. This system simultaneously ensured the transmission of scientific measurement data, the determination of orbital elements, and the transmission of commands from Earth to the interplanetary station to control its operation. The facsimile equipment ensured the transmission of intermediate-tone images with high analytical resolution.

The first batch of photos of the far side of the moon, obtained after preliminary processing, along with necessary supplementary explanations, will be published in the "Pravda" and "Izvestia" newspapers on October 27th. These photos will also be published in scientific journals in the future.

A committee has been established by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to name the craters, mountain ranges, and other features on the far side of the moon.

The automatic interplanetary station was also equipped with instruments for conducting scientific exploration in interplanetary space. The obtained scientific exploration results have been recorded on magnetic tape by ground observation stations and are currently being processed.

The first orbit of the automatic interplanetary station indicates that:

    The flight of the cosmic body along a complex, pre-calculated orbit has been successfully guaranteed;
    The task of determining the direction of the object in cosmic space has been solved;
    Radio telemetry communication and facsimile image transmission at various cosmic distances have been achieved;
    Images of the far side of the moon and many other scientific results, which could not be explored by various exploration methods until now, have been obtained.

At 20:00 on October 27th, the coordinates of the interplanetary station above the Earth's surface were 38 degrees 6 minutes west longitude and 6 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, and the distance from the center of the Earth was 484,000 kilometers.

Studies of the orbital characteristics of the automatic interplanetary station indicate that it will exist for about half a year (from the time of launch), during which it will orbit the Earth eleven to twelve times. Then, the interplanetary station will enter the Earth's dense atmosphere and burn up. (Attached images)

    塔斯社发表关于月球背面照片的公报
    行星际站巧夺天工
    距月球六七万公里时摄影　摄影历时四十分钟
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社莫斯科26日电：塔斯社发表了关于苏联自动行星际站拍摄月球背面照片的公报。全文如下：
    经初步整理所获得的关于月球背面的第一批照片，将于星期二在莫斯科报纸上发表，并附以必要的说明。月球摄影持续的时间约四十分钟，获得了大量的月球照片。
    照片胶卷的加工（显影和定影）是在行星际站上自动进行的。
    根据预定的科学研究计划，自动行星际站上拍摄月球背面照片和向地球发送照片的仪器，在10月7日莫斯科时间六点三十分，开始工作。
    为了拍摄月球照片，自动行星际站上装备有定向系统和带有自动加工胶卷的专门设备的传真仪器。
    拍摄时间选择在沿轨道运行的行星际站位于月球和太阳之间、而太阳照射月球背面70％的时候。这时，行星际站距月球表面六万到七万公里。
    自动行星际站上的定向系统发出特别号令，使行星际站的照像机镜头对准月球的背面，并发出开动照像机的号令。
    对月球摄影的时间持续了约四十分钟，获得了两种尺寸的、大量的月球照片。
    照片胶卷的加工（显影和定影）是在行星际站上自动进行的。
    向地球发回月球影像信号是用专门的无线电技术系统进行的。这个系统同时保证了：发回科学测量资料，确定轨道要素，同时，也保证了从地球向行星际站发送号令，以操纵行星际站的工作。传真仪器保证了能以很高的分析能力传回中间色调的影像。
    经过初步整理所获得的月球背面的第一批照片和附加的必要说明，将在10月27日登载在“真理报”和“消息报”上，这些照片今后还将在科学刊物上发表。
    为了给月球背面的寰形山、山系和其它特征命名，苏联科学院成立了一个委员会。
    自动行星际站上还装有在行星际空间进行科学考察的仪器。所获得的科学考察结果已由地面观测站用磁带记录下来，目前正在整理中。
    自动行星际站运行第一圈的情况表明：
    宇宙体沿着复杂的、事先计算好的轨道飞行，已经得到了顺利的保证；
    确定宇宙空间中实体的方向的任务已经解决；
    在各种宇宙距离中的无线电遥测联系和传真影像的播送，已经实现；
    至今用各种考察方法无法探索的月球背面影像和许多其它科学结果，已经获得。
    10月27日二十时，行星际站在地球表面上空的座标是，西经三十八度六分，北纬六度三十分，与地球中心的距离是，四十八万四千公里。
    对自动行星际站的轨道特征的研究表明，它将一直存在约半年（从发射时算起），在这期间，它将围绕地球飞行十一圈到十二圈。然后，行星际站将进入地球的稠密大气层而焚毁。（附图片）
