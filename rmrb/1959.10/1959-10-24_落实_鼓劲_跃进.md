    Implementation, Encouragement, Leap Forward
    Qing Ming
    The implementation of a plan requires that the plan conforms to objective reality and is based on a foundation that is both advanced and reliable. Implementation is to better encourage the masses' enthusiasm and achieve continued leap forward. Because a plan that is implemented has, on the one hand, an advanced nature, requiring jumping or even climbing a tree to pick the fruits of the leap forward. This can stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and encourage their drive. On the other hand, it is a practical and reliable plan that can be fully realized as long as we muster our efforts and make every possible effort. Under the guidance of such a plan, the masses will become more and more effective, more and more confident, and more and more enthusiastic, and can always maintain a strong revolutionary drive to fight heroically to achieve advanced indicators. If the plan is not implemented, either too high or too low, it will not be conducive to encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses. Because an overly high plan exceeds the possibility of objective reality, even after great efforts, it cannot be realized, which will damage the enthusiasm of the masses. An overly low plan, "within easy reach" and "easily obtained," will inevitably slacken the fighting spirit of the masses and cannot stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm and drive of the masses to achieve continued leap forward. Therefore, we advocate the implementation of the plan, which requires both appropriately raising the excessively low targets and appropriately lowering the excessively high targets, so as to achieve both advanced and reliable results, which is both an implemented plan and a plan to encourage enthusiasm and achieve a leap forward. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party made appropriate adjustments to this year's four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton based on the new situation. The adjusted targets: steel production is 12 million tons, an increase of 50% over last year's actual performance (native steel); coal production is 335 million tons, an increase of 24% over last year's actual performance; and grain and cotton production will each increase by about 10% over last year. Obviously, this is a plan for continued leap forward, and it is also a practical plan that can be fully realized through efforts. It is an example of how to deal with the implementation of plans. It can be seen that the implementation of the plan is unified with encouraging enthusiasm and achieving leap forward.
    People with right-leaning ideas mistakenly view the issue of implementation, opposing implementation to encouraging enthusiasm and leap forward. They do not talk about advancement, only about so-called "reliability," actually distorting implementation into backwardness and turning implementation into a synonym for backwardness. When formulating or revising plans, these people only look back, not forward, simply taking the production tasks that have been achieved in the past as planning indicators, even suppressing the plan below the level that has been reached, stagnating, or even regressing. They are afraid of difficulties and seek comfort, and when they encounter difficulties, they do not mobilize the masses to find solutions, find tricks, and tap potential to overcome difficulties in every possible way, but instead shout about difficulties, sigh and sigh, and passively rely on waiting. They only see things and not people, only calculate the possibility of material conditions, not the subjective initiative of people, only calculate dead accounts, not live accounts. They say that the potential has been exhausted, even though there is a lot of potential to be tapped. If the higher authorities assign new production tasks, they emphasize: to increase the tasks, it is necessary to increase equipment, materials, and manpower, otherwise it will not be implemented and the task cannot be completed. In short, they believe that the implementation of the plan means that the lower the target, the better, that there is no need for hard work, no need to encourage enthusiasm, and no need for leap forward. They even call this "proceeding from reality"! These people not only lack enthusiasm themselves and succumb to difficulties, but also spread negative and pessimistic sentiments, pour cold water on the masses, slacken the masses' enthusiasm, and vent the masses' anger.
    Obviously, this kind of thinking and practice runs counter to the Party's general line. It is not to exert efforts to go upstream, but to slacken and collapse and be content with being downstream; it is not to be vigorous, but to be cold and clear; it is not to be more, faster, better, and more economical, but to be less, slower, worse, and more expensive. These people's way of looking at problems is wrong. They look at problems with the isolated, static, and one-sided viewpoints of metaphysics, "picking up the cover is the letter" and "grabbing the tail is the cow." What they call "starting from reality" is actually divorced from reality. Isn't it? Repeating past facts in the planning targets would erase many favorable conditions brought about by the development of things? Starting only from the existing material conditions would ignore the subjective initiative of people? Reality should see both material factors and human factors, both emphasize objective conditions and emphasize subjective conditions even more. "The subjective initiative of the people is a great driving force." (Liu Shaoqi) Machines are manufactured and launched by people, and the production of material resources is realized through human activities. On the one hand, people's subjective initiative can fully utilize material conditions to give them a greater role. On the other hand, they can create new material conditions, turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and turn difficulties into victories. Marx said: "The most powerful productive force is the revolutionary class itself." Lenin said: "Workers and laborers are the primary productive force of all mankind." It can be seen that the role of people is the biggest and most important reality in all reality. And how can "only seeing things and not people" and ignoring the subjective initiative of people be called "proceeding from reality"? Things are constantly developing and changing, and objective reality is also constantly developing and changing. Those who only look at the past, not the present and the future, and only seize the outdated reality (the level of production that has been reached), not the reality that is moving, developing, changing, and advancing, are not falling behind objective reality and deviating from reality? Implementation should be based on advanced reality, on the reality of the masses' strength, and on the reality of encouraging enthusiasm. It is necessary to consider material conditions, but also to fully estimate the subjective initiative of people. It is necessary to consider the level that has been reached, but also to fully estimate the new favorable conditions. It is necessary to see the existing actual situation, but also to face the future and see the development and changes of things. Only in this way, by conducting a comprehensive examination of the objective situation and basing the indicators on a foundation that is both advanced and reliable, in line with or close to the laws of the development of things, can we achieve true implementation. Truly proceed from reality. At present, we must recognize that the situation we are in is a situation of continued leap forward, and there is a bright future ahead of us. Difficulties are only local and temporary, and are non-essential and non-mainstream aspects, while the essential and mainstream aspects are favorable situations and factors to overcome difficulties. Therefore, we must resolutely criticize and overcome right-leaning thoughts and emotions, muster our efforts, rely on the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of people, overcome the difficulties on the road to advancement, and achieve continued leap forward.
    Implementation, encouragement, and leap forward are interrelated. The implementation of the plan can further encourage the masses' enthusiasm and maintain a strong revolutionary will. The more enthusiastic the work, the faster and better we can achieve leap forward targets and obtain fruitful leap forward results. In this process, enthusiasm is the decisive factor. If there is a lack of enthusiasm, it is impossible to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations and research, conduct scientific analysis, make the plan conform to or be close to the objective laws of the development of things, and formulate advanced indicators that can be achieved, so as to achieve the true implementation of the plan. And the implemented plan is only a realistic possibility. To turn this possibility into reality still depends on mustering our efforts to work hard. If there is a lack of enthusiasm and we retreat in the face of difficulties in the process of implementing the plan, the plan cannot be realized, and it is impossible to achieve the goal of leap forward. Therefore, people's enthusiasm is extremely valuable. With enthusiasm, there is a spirit of perseverance, and there is a combination of hard work and clever work. Enthusiasm leads to advanced indicators and measures, and enthusiasm leads to leap forward results. We must always muster our enthusiasm. Right-leaning thoughts and emotions are the opposite of mustering our enthusiasm. We must oppose right-leaning and muster our enthusiasm.

    落实·鼓劲·跃进
    晴明
    计划落实，就是要求计划合乎客观实际，落在既先进又可靠的基础上。落实，是为了更好地鼓足群众的干劲，实现继续跃进。因为落实的计划，一方面具有先进性，需要跳一跳甚至爬上树才能把跃进的果子摘下来，这就能激发群众的革命热情，鼓足群众的干劲；另方面它又是切实可靠的计划，只要鼓足干劲，经过千方百计地努力就完全能够实现。在这种计划指导下，群众就越干越有成效，越干信心越足，越干劲头越大，就能经常保持旺盛的革命干劲，为实现先进指标而英勇奋战。如果计划不落实，或则过高，或则过低，都不利于鼓足群众的干劲。因为过高的计划，超越了客观现实可能性，虽然经过很大努力也不能实现，结果将会损害群众的积极性；过低的计划，“伸手可及”，“垂手可得”，必然松懈群众的斗志，不能激发群众的革命热情和干劲，实现继续跃进。所以，我们提倡计划落实，既要把过低的指标适当地提高，也必须把过高的指标适当地降低，以达到既先进又可靠，既是落实的计划，又是鼓足干劲，实现跃进的计划。党的八届八中全会，根据新的情况，对今年的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标作了适当地调整。调整后的指标：钢产量为一千二百万吨，比去年实绩（洋钢）增长50％；煤产量为三亿三千五百万吨，比去年实绩增长24％；粮食和棉花的产量，比去年各增产10％左右。显然，这是一个继续跃进的计划，同时也是合乎实际的、经过努力完全能够实现的计划。它是处理计划落实问题的范例。由此可见，计划落实与鼓足干劲、实现跃进三者是统一的。
    有右倾思想的人，错误地看待落实的问题，把落实与鼓干劲对立起来，与跃进对立起来。他们不讲先进，只讲所谓“可靠”，实际上是把落实曲解为落后，把落实变成落后的同义语。这种人在制订或修订计划的时候，只向后看，不向前看，把过去已经实现的生产任务，简单地拿来作为计划指标，甚至把计划压在已达到的水平之下，踏步不前，甚至后退；他们畏难苟安，遇到了困难不是发动群众想办法、找窍门、挖潜力，千方百计地战胜困难，而是叫喊困难，唉声叹气，消极地依赖等待；他们只见物不见人，只计算物质条件的可能性，不计算人的主观能动作用，只算死账，不算活账，本来有许多潜力可挖，他说潜力已挖光了，如果上级布置新的生产任务，他就强调：要增加任务，就要增加设备、材料和人力，否则就是不落实，任务就无法完成。总之，他们认为：计划落实就是指标越低越好，就是不再需要苦干了，不再需要鼓足干劲了，不再跃进了。这样做，他们还美其名为“从实际出发”呢！这种人不仅自己干劲不足，向困难屈服，而且散布消极悲观情绪，给群众泼冷水，松群众的劲，泄群众的气。
    显然，这种想法和做法是同党的总路线背道而驰的，不是鼓足干劲，力争上游，而是松劲疲塌，甘居下游；不是轰轰烈烈，而是冷冷清清；不是多快好省，而是少慢差费。这种人看问题的方法不对，他们以形而上学的那种孤立的、静止的、片面的观点看问题，“拣到封皮就是信”“抓住尾巴就是牛”。他们所讲的“从实际出发”，其实正是脱离了实际。不是吗？计划指标重复过去已经发生的事实，不就抹去了随着事物的发展所带来的许多有利条件吗？仅仅从现有物质条件出发，不就忽视了人的主观能动作用吗？实际，应当既看到物的因素，也看到人的因素，既重视客观条件，更重视主观条件。“人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。”（刘少奇语）机器是由人来制造和发动的，物质资料的生产是经过人的活动来实现的。人的主观能动作用，一方面可以充分利用物质条件，使其发挥更大的作用；另方面可以创造新的物质条件，变不利条件为有利条件，化困难为胜利。马克思说：“最强大的一种生产力是革命阶级本身。”列宁说：“工人、劳动者是全人类的首要生产力。”可见，人的作用正是一切实际中最大最重要的实际。而“只见物不见人”，忽视人的主观能动作用，还能叫“从实际出发”吗？事物是不断发展变化的，客观实际也是不断发展变化的。那种只看过去，不看现在和将来，只抓住已经过时的实际（已达到的生产水平），不抓正在运动、发展、变化、前进着的实际，不正是落在客观实际的后面而脱离了实际吗？落实，应当落先进之实，落群众力量之实，落鼓足干劲之实。既要考虑物质条件，也必须充分估计人的主观能动作用；既要考虑已达到的水平，也必须充分估计新的有利条件；既要看到现有的实际情况，也要面向将来，看到事物发展变化的情况。只有这样，对客观情况进行全面地考察，把指标奠定在既先进又可靠的基础上，符合或接近于事物发展的规律，才是真正的落实。真正的从实际出发。目前，我们必须认清：我们所处的形势，是继续跃进的形势，我们面前是一片光明，困难只是局部的、暂时的，是非本质非主流的方面，而本质的主流的方面是有利形势和战胜困难的因素。从而坚决地批判与克服右倾思想和情绪，鼓足干劲，依靠广大群众的智慧和力量，战胜前进道路上的困难，实现继续跃进。
    落实、鼓劲、跃进，三者是互相联系的。计划落实，就能够进一步鼓足群众干劲，经常保持旺盛的革命斗志；干劲愈足，也就能更快更好地实现跃进指标，获得丰硕的跃进果实。这中间，干劲是决定性的因素；如果缺乏干劲，就不可能进行深入细致的调查研究、进行科学分析，使计划符合或接近于事物发展的客观规律，订出可能实现的先进指标，达到计划的真正落实；而落实的计划，也还只是有了现实的可能性，要把这种可能性变为现实，仍然决定于鼓足干劲去干，如缺乏干劲，在实现计划的过程中畏难退却，计划就不可能实现，也就不可能达到跃进的目的。所以，人们的干劲是极其可贵的，有了干劲，就有钻劲，就有苦干和巧干的结合。干劲出先进指标和措施，干劲出跃进果实。任何时候都要鼓足干劲。右倾思想和情绪是鼓足干劲的对立物。我们必须反掉右倾，鼓足干劲。
