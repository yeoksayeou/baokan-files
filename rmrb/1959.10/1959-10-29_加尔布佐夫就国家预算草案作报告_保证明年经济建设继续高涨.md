Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: According to TASS, Soviet Deputy Minister of Finance Garbuzov stated in a report on the draft 1960 Soviet national budget to the Soviet Supreme Soviet on the 27th that the Soviet economy is in a new period of vigorous development. He said that the draft stipulates a total revenue of 772.1 billion rubles and a total expenditure of 744.8 billion rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 27.3 billion rubles. The new budget revenue exceeds the 1959 budget revenue by 48.8 billion rubles.

The reporter emphasized that, as in previous years, the income of the socialist national economy plays a decisive role in budget revenue. In 1960, this income will exceed 700 billion rubles.

The reporter said that in the state budget's revenue, the proportion of residents' tax payments will decrease from 7.8% in 1959 to 7.4%, and the total amount of residents' tax payments will decrease by 12 billion rubles within a year.

Garbuzov said that the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government have entrusted the State Planning Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the State Committee on Labor and Wages, and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions to draft a major measure—a proposal to stop taxing residents in the coming years.

The draft stipulates an allocation of 575.2 billion rubles to develop the national economy and social and cultural undertakings, which is 6.3% more than in 1959.

The total amount of expenditures for the national economy from enterprise budgets and funds is 522.4 billion rubles, an increase of 37.9% compared to 1959. The allocation for industry is 279.1 billion rubles, for transportation and postal and telecommunications industries is 57.4 billion rubles, and for agriculture is 50.6 billion rubles.

The reporter emphasized that the Soviet Union has greatly reduced its armed forces and reduced defense expenditures in recent years. The defense expenditure in the 1960 national budget is stipulated to be 96.1 billion rubles, which is the same as in 1959. The proportion of defense expenditure in the budget is gradually decreasing, accounting for 12.9% in 1960, while it accounted for 19.9% in 1955.

Garbuzov said that the Soviet government is taking all measures to ease international tensions and strengthen peace and friendship between all peoples. The new proposal on complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the head of the Soviet government, Khrushchev, at the UN General Assembly proves this point.

The reporter pointed out that in the draft 1960 Soviet national budget, investment in heavy industry has greatly increased. The total investment in the entire national economy has increased by about 11%, of which investment in the chemical industry has increased by more than 30%, investment in the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by nearly 30%, investment in the metallurgical industry has increased by 20%, and investment in the oil and gas industry has increased by more than 15%. Investment in light industry and the food industry has increased by 13.6%.

The budget draft stipulates that the allocation for developing social and cultural undertakings is 247.4 billion rubles, which is 15.2 billion rubles more than in 1959.

The funds for developing science will increase by 15.4% compared to this year.

The allocation for housing construction is stipulated to be 47.7 billion rubles. In addition, about 6 billion rubles will be allocated from enterprise funds, extra-plan profits, and other sources of economic organizations for housing construction.

Garbuzov concluded by saying that the 1960 national budget reflects the Soviet government's peaceful policy, and its task is to ensure the further upsurge of all sectors of the socialist economy and culture, and to improve the material welfare of the residents.

In addition to the draft 1960 budget, the meeting was also submitted for approval regarding the execution of the 1958 Soviet national budget. In 1958, the revenue was 672.3 billion rubles and the expenditure was 642.7 billion rubles.

    加尔布佐夫就国家预算草案作报告
    保证明年经济建设继续高涨
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联财政部副部长加尔布佐夫27日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上就1960年苏联国家预算草案所作的报告中指出，苏联经济正处在新的蓬勃发展中。他说，草案中规定收入总额为七千七百二十一亿卢布，支出总额为七千四百四十八亿卢布，收入超过支出二百七十三亿卢布。新的预算收入额比1959年预算收入额增加了四百八十八亿卢布。
    报告人强调说，像往年一样，社会主义国民经济的收入在预算收入中具有决定性意义，在1960年这笔收入将超过七千亿卢布。
    报告人说，在国家预算的收入中，居民纳税的比重，将从1959年的7.8％降低到7.4％，居民纳税总额在一年内减少一百二十亿卢布。
    加尔布佐夫说，苏共中央和苏联政府已经委托国家计划委员会、财政部、国家劳动和工资问题委员会以及全苏工会中央理事会起草一项重大措施——在最近几年内停止向居民征税的建议。
    草案规定拨款五千七百五十二亿卢布来发展国民经济和社会和文化事业，这比1959年增多了6.3％。
    从企业的预算和资金中拨来用于国民经济开支的总额为五千二百二十四亿卢布，即比1959年增加37.9％，对工业的拨款为二千七百九十一亿卢布，对运输业和邮电业的拨款为五百七十四亿卢布，对农业的拨款为五百零六亿卢布。
    报告人着重指出，苏联最近几年大大裁减了武装部队和缩减国防开支。1960年国家预算中的国防开支规定为九百六十一亿卢布，即和1959年相等。国防开支在预算中的比重正在逐渐减少，在1960年占12.9％，而1955年则占19.9％。
    加尔布佐夫说，苏联政府正在采取一切措施来缓和国际紧张局势，加强和平和各国人民之间的友谊。苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在联大会议上提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的新建议就证明了这点。
    报告人指出，在1960年苏联国家预算草案中，重工业投资大大增加。整个国民经济投资总额约增加11％，其中化学工业投资增加30％以上，机器制造业投资增加将近30％，冶金工业投资增加20％，石油和瓦斯工业投资增加15％以上。轻工业和食品工业投资增加13.6％。
    在预算草案中规定，用于发展社会和文化事业的拨款为二千四百七十四亿卢布，即比1959年增加一百五十二亿卢布。
    用于发展科学的经费将比今年增加15.4％。
    住宅建设的拨款规定为四百七十七亿卢布。此外，还将从企业基金、超计划利润和经济组织的其他来源中拨出约六十亿卢布来用于住宅建设。
    加尔布佐夫最后说，1960年的国家预算反映了苏联政府的和平政策，它的任务是保证社会主义经济各个部门和文化的进一步高涨以及提高居民的物质生活福利。
    除了1960年的预算草案之外，提交会议批准的还有关于1958年苏联国家预算的执行情况。1958年，收入为六千七百二十三亿卢布，支出为六千四百二十七亿卢布。
