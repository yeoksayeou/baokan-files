Taking Production as the Center, Carry the Spirit of Anti-Rightism and Exerting Efforts to Every Corner, Completing This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule to Prepare for Next Year's Great Leap Forward
Henan Provincial Party Committee and Hunan Provincial Party Committee Held Enlarged Meetings Respectively to Analyze the Current Situation and Arrange Future Tasks

(Our Dispatch) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened its First Plenary Session, the Fourteenth Meeting, from August 23 to September 25; during this period, a meeting of cadres at the provincial, district, and county levels was also held simultaneously.

The meeting was chaired by Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, who conveyed the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and earnestly studied the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session. The comrades present received a profound education, enhanced their ideological level, and unanimously agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session was of great historical significance. In the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, the comrades present examined and criticized right-leaning thoughts, further strengthened their confidence in implementing the General Line, consolidating the People's Communes, and continuing the Great Leap Forward. On the premise of correctly analyzing the current favorable situation, they mustered even greater efforts to strive for the upstream and determined the main targets for Henan Province's production and construction next year, resolving to strive forward to overfulfill this year's plan.

The meeting pointed out that the overall situation in Henan Province is very good. Last year, a Great Leap Forward was achieved, and this year is still a situation of continuing the Great Leap Forward. Last year's total industrial output value increased by 173.71% compared to 1957, equivalent to four times the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period; investment in capital construction increased by more than two times compared to 1957; total grain output increased by 62%, cotton increased by 58.6%, and coal increased by more than one and a half times. On the basis of great development in production, the people's living standards have also greatly improved. Henan, a province with no iron and steel in history, produced 413,000 tons of good iron and 31,662 tons of good steel after vigorously developing iron and steel last year. The proportion of the province's total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value rose from 26.1% in 1957 to 36.1% last year, and will rise to 40% this year. The development of industries such as metallurgy, chemicals, and machinery manufacturing is beginning to change Henan Province's historically backward industrial face, accelerating the process of realizing industrialization and agricultural mechanization. The meeting also focused on analyzing the superiority of the People's Communes. Last year, six million people vigorously developed iron and steel, water conservancy construction greatly developed, and industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, culture and education, and collective welfare undertakings leaped forward, as well as the grand in scale, long-lasting, and remarkably effective drought resistance struggle this year, all of which demonstrated the infinite vitality of the communes. Since last year, the province has built many water conservancy projects, with an irrigation area of more than 70 million mu. The province's People's Communes already own more than 10,000 sets of power machinery, and 14% of the communes have tractors. Communes have established more than 4,000 industries. From January to August this year, new and great achievements have been made on all fronts throughout the province. The total industrial output value increased by 119.78% compared to the same period last year. Pig iron, raw coal, electricity, machinery, chemicals, and transportation have all greatly developed. The total grain output is expected to increase by 12.5% compared to last year, and cotton will increase by 33.3%. This is a great harvest achieved in the context of a major drought. Retail sales of commodities have also greatly increased compared to the same period last year, and new developments have been made in culture and education and political and legal work. Due to the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production last year and in the first eight months of this year, it is expected that the main indicators of the province's Second Five-Year Plan can be completed and overfulfilled this year. These major achievements determine that the development prospects for industrial and agricultural production next year will be even more brilliant. This series of vivid leap forward facts shows that the Party's General Line is completely correct.

After analyzing the province's industrial and agricultural production situation and summarizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, the meeting emphasized that this year's production targets must be completed and overfulfilled, and at the same time, preparations must be made for the continued leap forward next year. The meeting requested that this winter and next spring, we must deeply implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Provincial Party Committee's plan on implementing the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party "Resolution on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy," resolutely oppose right-leaning thoughts, muster greater efforts, and extensively and deeply launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, pushing industrial and agricultural production to a new and greater climax. Strive for a great overproduction in industry and a great harvest in agriculture. In terms of industrial production, we must resolutely implement the policy of combining strengthening management with vigorously developing mass movements, to achieve high quality, high output, multiple varieties, high efficiency, low consumption, low cost, and complete and overfulfill the national plan according to quality, quantity, monthly, and decadal basis, especially to seize the production of steel, coal, timber, and cement. In terms of capital construction, we must continue to implement the policy of "one game of chess," ensure key projects, promote rapid construction experience, ensure quality and quantity, and quickly exert investment effects. In terms of agriculture, we must fight the drought to the end, grasp the management of autumn fields, achieve autumn harvest with all grains in storage, ensure the completion of 80 million mu of autumn sowing tasks, and on the basis of successfully completing the three autumn tasks and autumn distribution work, vigorously develop water conservancy construction to ensure that before next year's wheat harvest, the province's effective irrigation area reaches 90 million mu, striving for 100 million mu. In terms of transportation, we must first do a good job in the transportation of iron, coal, timber, grain, export goods, and building materials, and tap the potential of railways, highways, and shipping. In terms of finance and trade, we must earnestly do a good job in the procurement and supply of agricultural products such as cotton and tobacco leaves. The meeting proposed the savings targets for coal, pit wood, fuel oil, and the three major materials (steel, timber, and cement) in capital construction before the end of the year.

The meeting believed that in order to continuously achieve victory in the revolutionary cause, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the unity and unification of the Party. We must regard the regular maintenance of Party unity as the sacred duty of every Party member.

In order to thoroughly overcome right-leaning opportunist thoughts within the Party, further consolidate Party unity, better implement the General Line, and accelerate socialist construction, the meeting called on all Party cadres and members to launch a new rectification movement in accordance with the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Chairman Mao, actively participate in the struggle against right-leaning opportunism, eliminate their own right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions, improve their political and ideological awareness, strengthen Party spirit training, and hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, to heroically struggle to achieve the goals of increasing production and practicing economy and the new production and construction plan during the Second Five-Year Plan period. (Zhang Jianhong)

(Our Dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged plenary meeting from August 22 to September 15. After conveying, studying, and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the comrades present unanimously believed that they had received an extremely profound education in Marxism-Leninism and an extremely profound education in the Party's General Line for socialist construction. In accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the meeting analyzed the excellent situation in the province in 1959, deployed the current work, and conducted a serious criticism of the right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning activities of a small number of cadres. The meeting called on all Party members and cadres in the province to oppose right-leaning, exert efforts, deeply mobilize the masses, vigorously develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, and implement the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in all aspects of work, setting off a larger-scale leap forward upsurge.

The meeting believed that the current situation in Hunan Province, like other parts of the country, is one of brightness. All sectors of the national economy and all aspects of socialist construction have achieved tremendous achievements on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In agriculture, this year is another year of great harvest. Although the planting area of ​​early rice and middle rice decreased by more than 4 million mu, and middle rice suffered from a large area of ​​drought, the total output is not less than last year. The season for transplanting late rice seedlings was greatly advanced compared to previous years, and the recent drought resistance struggle has also achieved great victories. The sown area of ​​cash crops such as cotton, hemp, oil crops, and sugar crops has been expanded compared to last year, and the total output will exceed last year. The annual output of livestock and aquatic products such as pigs, fish, chickens, and ducks will all exceed last year, and the timber felling plan of 2.5 million cubic meters can also be realized. This year, the average income per person in rural areas will increase by 20% to 30% compared to last year. In industry, compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value increased by one time. County and commune industries have been consolidated and improved through rectification and have embarked on a path of healthy development. The volume of freight transportation increased by 77.62% compared with the same period last year. In commerce, the purchase volume of agricultural and sideline products in the first half of the year increased by 41.05% compared with the same period last year, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 34.14% compared with the same period last year. In particular, the supply of means of production exceeded any previous year; the market supply situation in the first half of the year was stable. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed and improved greatly. After opposing right-leaning and exerting efforts, and further developing the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, since August, all kinds of production are advancing at a leaping pace that greatly exceeds the growth rate in the first half of the year. The most fundamental reasons for achieving these major achievements are the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the correctness and greatness of the Party's General Line, the superiority of the People's Communes, and the soaring efforts of the entire Party and the entire people.

The meeting pointed out that this excellent situation is the mainstream of the current situation. However, some right-leaning opportunists in Hunan Province vilified the Great Leap Forward movement and the People's Commune movement as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." The meeting refuted and criticized the various fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists who criticized and attacked the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes with a large number of irrefutable facts. The meeting pointed out that, like other parts of the country, Hunan Province achieved unprecedentedly great achievements in all aspects of the Great Leap Forward movement last year. The realization of the people's commune on the basis of advanced agricultural cooperatives was the inevitable result of the Great Leap Forward last year. As early as the spring and summer seasons of last year, and even before 1958, the broad masses spontaneously merged large cooperatives, established nurseries and canteens, and many practices of the People's Communes had already appeared in many places without prior consultation, and by the summer of 1958, an unstoppable trend had formed. The great leap forward in agricultural production, the large-scale steelmaking, the large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy, and the great upsurge of the communist thinking of the peasants demanding expanded cooperation led to the rapid realization of the people's communes. Since the establishment of public canteens throughout the province last year, they have been deeply welcomed by the broad masses, and the vast majority have been well-run and consolidated. They have played a great role in saving materials, implementing planned grain consumption, saving labor, especially liberating women's labor and participating in production. More than 9 million women were liberated from housework throughout the province and participated in agricultural and industrial production, more than twice as many as in 1957. The People's Communes implemented a semi-wage and semi-supply system, which played an extremely great role in liberating productive forces, giving play to the enthusiasm of the working masses, and ensuring the Great Leap Forward, and was warmly supported by the broad masses, especially the poor peasants and the new and old lower-middle peasants. These iron facts prove that all the fallacies and slanders spread by the right-leaning opportunists can only prove that they have left the socialist and people's standpoint and are actually a sinful act against the cause of socialist construction.

The meeting called on all Party members in the province to unite under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, to defend the Party's General Line, oppose right-leaning opportunism, exert efforts, strive for the upstream, unite the people of the province, hold high the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and work with the people of the whole country to build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

The meeting requested that all levels of Party organizations in the province resolutely and swiftly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, take production as the center, and focus on production, consistently implement the spirit of opposing right-leaning and exerting efforts, and carry out a re-education movement on the socialist General Line among all Party members and the masses.

The meeting also made rough arrangements for the work this winter and next spring. The meeting requested that all levels of Party organizations seize the excellent situation that has emerged through opposing right-leaning and exerting efforts, lead the people of the province to work hard, do practical work, and work skillfully, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill this year's leap forward plan and continue to realize next year's leap forward.

    以生产为中心把反右倾鼓干劲的精神贯彻到每个角落去
    提前完成今年计划为明年大跃进做好准备
    河南省委、湖南省委分别举行扩大会议分析当前形势安排今后任务
    本报讯　中共河南省委于8月23日至9月25日召开了第一届第十四次全体会议；在此期间，同时召开了省、地、县三级干部会议。
    会议由省委第一书记吴芝圃同志传达了党的八届八中全会的精神，认真学习了八中全会的决议。与会同志都受到了一次极为深刻的教育，提高了思想水平，一致认为八届八中全会具有重大历史意义。到会同志本着八中全会的精神，检查批判了右倾思想，进一步坚定了贯彻执行总路线，巩固人民公社和继续大跃进的信心，并且在正确分析当前有利形势的前提下，鼓足更大干劲，力争上游，确定了明年河南省的生产建设主要指标，决心为超额完成今年的计划而奋勇前进。
    会议指出，河南省的整个形势是很好的。去年实现了大跃进，今年仍然是一个继续大跃进的局面。去年的工业总产值比1957年增长了173.71％，相当于第一个五年计划期间增长总和的四倍；基本建设投资比1957年增长了两倍以上，粮食总产量增长了62％，棉花增长了58.6％，煤增长一倍半以上。在生产大发展的基础上，人民生活水平也有了很大的提高。河南这个历史上无铁无钢的省份，去年大办钢铁以后生产了好铁四十一万三千吨，好钢三万一千六百六十二吨。全省工业总产值占工农业总产值的比重，由1957年的26.1％上升到去年的36.1％，今年将上升到40％。冶金、化学、机械制造等工业的发展，开始改变着河南省历来工业落后的面貌，加速了实现工业化和农业机械化的进程。会议还着重分析了人民公社的优越性。去年六百万人大办钢铁，水利建设大发展，工业、农业、交通、财贸、文教、集体福利事业飞跃进展，以及今年规模宏伟、时间持久、成效卓著的抗旱斗争，都体现了公社无穷的生命力。去年以来，全省兴修了许多水利工程，灌溉面积达七千余万亩。全省人民公社已拥有动力机械一万多部（台），14％的公社有了拖拉机。社办工业达四千多个。今年1月到8月，全省各个战线上又取得了新的巨大成就。工业总产值比去年同期增长119.78％。生铁、原煤、电力、机械、化工、交通运输等都有了很大的发展。粮食总产量预计将比去年增长12.5％，棉花将增长33.3％。这是大旱情况下获得的大丰收。商品零售量也比去年同期有很大增长，文教、政法工作方面，都有了新的发展。由于去年和今年前八个月工农业生产的高速度发展，预计今年就可以完成和超额完成全省第二个五年计划的主要指标。这些重大的成就决定了明年工农业生产的发展前景更加灿烂。这一系列生动的跃进事实表明：党的总路线是完全正确的。
    会议在分析了全省工农业生产形势，总结了大跃进的成就以后，着重指出：今年的生产指标必须完成和超额完成，同时要为明年的继续跃进作好准备。会议要求今冬明春，必须深入地贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议和省委关于贯彻执行党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”的方案，坚决反对右倾思想，鼓足更大干劲，广泛深入地开展增产节约的群众运动，把工农业生产推向新的更大高潮。争取工业大超产，农业大丰收。工业生产方面，要坚决贯彻执行加强管理与大搞群众运动相结合的方针，作到优质、高产、多品种、高效率、低消耗、低成本、按质、按量、按月、按旬地完成与超额完成国家计划，特别要抓紧钢铁、煤炭、木材、水泥的生产。基本建设方面，要继续贯彻“一盘棋”的方针，保证重点项目，推广快速施工经验，保质保量，迅速发挥投资效果。农业方面，要抗旱到底，抓秋田管理，做到秋收颗粒还仓，保证完成八千万亩秋播任务，并在胜利完成三秋工作和秋季分配工作的基础上，大搞水利建设，保证明年麦收前，全省有效灌溉面积达到九千万亩，争取一亿亩。交通运输方面，首先要作好铁、煤炭、木材、粮食、出口物资和建筑材料的运输，挖掘铁路、公路、航运的潜力。财贸方面，要认真做好棉花、烟叶等农产品的采购和供应工作。会议提出了年底以前煤炭、坑木、燃料油，以及基本建设中三大主材（钢材、木材、水泥）的节约指标。
    会议认为，要不断取得革命事业的胜利，必须不断地加强党的团结与统一。要把经常维护党的团结看作是每个党员的神圣职责。
    为了彻底克服党内的右倾机会主义思想，进一步巩固党的团结，更好地贯彻总路线，加速社会主义建设，会议号召全党干部和党员根据党的八届八中全会决议和毛主席的指示，开展一次新的整风运动，积极参加反对右倾机会主义的斗争，清除自己的右倾思想、右倾情绪，提高政治思想觉悟，增强党性锻炼，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，为实现增产节约指标和第二个五年计划期间新的生产建设计划而英勇奋斗。　（张健虹）
    本报讯　中共湖南省委从8月22日到9月15日举行扩大的全体会议。经过传达、学习和讨论党的八届八中全会的决议，到会同志一致认为受到了一次极其深刻的马克思列宁主义的教育，受到了一次极其深刻的党的社会主义建设总路线的教育。会议根据八届八中全会决议的精神，分析了全省1959年的大好形势，部署了当前的工作，对于一小部分干部的右倾思想和右倾活动进行了严肃的批判。会议号召全省党员、干部反右倾、鼓干劲，深入发动群众，大搞增产节约运动，把党的八届八中全会决议的精神贯彻到各方面的工作中去，掀起更大规模的跃进高潮。
    会议认为：湖南省当前的形势和全国各地一样。是一片光明，国民经济的各个部门和社会主义建设的各个方面，都在1958年大跃进的基础上取得了巨大的成绩。在农业方面，今年又是一个大丰收的局面，虽然早稻和中稻的种植面积减少四百多万亩，中稻又遭受了大面积的干旱，但总产量不少于去年。晚稻插秧季节比往年大大提前，最近的抗旱斗争也已经取得了很大的胜利。棉、麻、油料、糖料等经济作物播种面积比去年扩大，总产量将超过去年。猪、鱼、鸡、鸭等畜牧水产的全年产量，都将超过去年，二百五十万立方米的木材采伐计划，也可以实现。今年农村每人平均收入，将比去年增长20％到30％。在工业方面，今年上半年和去年同期比较，工业总产值增长一倍，县、社工业经过整顿，已经巩固提高，走上了健康发展的道路。交通运输的货运量，比去年同期增长了77.62％。商业方面，上半年农副产品采购量比去年同期增长41.05％，社会商品零售总额比去年同期增长34.14％，特别是生产资料的供应量，超过以往任何一年；上半年市场供应情况是稳定的。文教卫生事业也有了很大发展和提高。经过反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展增产节约的群众运动，8月份以来，各项生产正以大大超过上半年增长速度的跃进步伐前进。取得这些重大成就的最根本的原因，是党中央和毛主席的英明领导，党的总路线的正确伟大，人民公社的优越性和全党全民发挥了冲天干劲。
    会议指出：这个大好形势，是当前形势的主流。但是，湖南省的某些右倾机会主义者把大跃进运动和人民公社运动，诬蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”。会议用大量的无可辩驳的事实，驳斥和批判了右倾机会主义者非难和攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社的各种谬论。会议指出：湖南省和全国各地一样，去年大跃进运动在各方面取得的伟大成就是史无前例的。在农业高级合作社的基础上实现人民公社化，是去年大跃进的必然结果。早在去年春夏两季，甚至早在1958年以前，广大群众就自发地并大社，办托儿所和食堂，人民公社的许多作法早就在许多地方不谋而合地出现了，到1958年夏季就形成了不可阻挡的趋势。农业生产大跃进，大炼钢铁，农田水利大建设，农民要求扩大协作的共产主义思想的大高涨，就使人民公社化迅速实现了。公共食堂从去年在全省建立以来，一直深受广大群众的欢迎，绝大多数是办得好的、巩固的。在节约物资、实行计划用粮、节约劳动力、特别是解放妇女劳动力参加生产等方面，都起了很大的作用。全省从家务劳动中解放出九百多万名妇女，参加了农业、工业生产，比1957年增加两倍多。人民公社实行半工资半供给制，在解放生产力、发挥劳动群众积极性、保证大跃进方面，发挥了极其伟大的作用，受到广大群众特别是贫农和新老下中农的热烈拥护。这些铁的事实证明，右倾机会主义者散布的一切谬论和诬蔑，都只能证明他们已经离开了社会主义和人民的立场，实际上是一种对于社会主义建设事业的罪恶行为。
    会议号召全省党员在党中央和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下，团结一致，保卫党的总路线，反对右倾机会主义，鼓足干劲，力争上游，团结全省人民，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，和全国人民一道，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    会议要求全省各级党组织坚决地迅速地贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议，以生产为中心，围绕生产，自始至终贯彻反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，在全体党员和群众中开展一次社会主义总路线的再教育运动。
    会议对今冬明春的工作，也作了大体安排。会议要求各级党组织抓紧通过反右倾、鼓干劲出现的大好形势，领导全省人民苦干实干巧干，为全面超额完成今年的跃进计划，继续实现明年的跃进而奋勇前进。
