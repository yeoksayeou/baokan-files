　　A Pearl Under the Swan's Neck
　　Lǚ Qí'ēn
    Unfold the map of China, and in its northeast corner, there is a lithe swan, which is the "Land of Abundance" north of the Great Wall – Heilongjiang Province. Harbin, this important industrial city in northern China, is like a sparkling pearl, hanging under the swan's neck, nestled on the banks of the rich and beautiful Songhua River. In the long history of the motherland, she is still a young city, with only sixty years since its opening as a port. In the long years before liberation, she experienced the ravages of war, endured wind and frost, suffered the oppression of Tsarist Russia, the slaughter of warlords, and also tasted the bitterness of the Japanese imperialist invasion. Here, there was once filled with sharp national and class contradictions.
    From 1925, Harbin had underground organizations of the Chinese Communist Party. The Party, like a lighthouse in the vast night sea, awakened people's hope and illuminated their hearts. Under the leadership of the Party, the heroic Harbin ignited the flames of struggle against the enemy, and the flames of struggle tempered her into steel.
    Harbin was the first major city in the country to be liberated. During the Liberation War, she supported the "Three Down to Jiangnan and Four Defenses of Linjiang" campaign, shipping out batches of strategic materials, powerfully supporting the struggle for national liberation. In the period of peaceful construction, Harbin was even more full of youthful vitality, speeding forward by leaps and bounds, fundamentally changing its past appearance.
    More than ten years ago, Harbin was still a purely consumer city with only a few "oil, wine, rice, and flour" processing industries, but today it has become one of the motherland's important industrial cities with strong production capacity. Before liberation, there were only two factories with more than a thousand people, but now it has increased to seventy-eight. The total industrial output value before liberation was only 40 million yuan, but by the end of this year, it will be 4 billion yuan, an increase of nearly one hundred times. The city's population and housing area have also doubled since liberation. Magnificent modern factories have sprung up one after another. On Anle Street, nine miles long in the southwest of Harbin, there are factories connected to factories. Here are the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Steam Turbine Plant, which are the famous "Power Homeland" of the country. The three major power plants of the "Power Homeland," as well as the Electric Carbon Plant, Electric Meter Instrument Plant, Electric Wire Plant, Insulation Material Plant, and Battery Plant, constitute a powerful electric power industry system. Here, it is possible to produce power station equipment weighing thousands of tons, power station boilers as tall as seven-story buildings, and 72,500-kilowatt hydro-generators that can simultaneously drive four large trucks. The giant power station equipment produced here has supplied the needs of key national construction projects such as Xin'anjiang, Foziling, Shizitan, and Liulangdong. The power station equipment from the "Power Homeland" has begun to generate heat and light throughout the motherland. On both sides of "Peace Road," a wide asphalt road newly built after liberation, stand Harbin's "two darlings" like twin sisters—the modern Flax Textile Factory and the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory. Such "ocean fleets," group after group, are all over the beautiful city of Harbin. Here, not only can giant power generation equipment be produced, but also drills finer than hair and precision bearings as small as rice grains. When you stand in the magnificent workshops of the major factories, hear the heroic music intertwined with the sound of overhead cranes and the roar of motors, and see towering objects like small mountains such as high-pressure boilers and hydro-generators and various precision tools being produced continuously, you will feel a strong youthful atmosphere and hear the footsteps of the great leap forward of the motherland.
    Harbin not only has brand-new "ocean fleets" but also many important technical creations. The Jiulian Machine Factory, in the "four without" situation of "no large factory buildings, no large machine tools, no large cranes, and no large cast steel equipment," created "building block" machine tools and used the "ants gnawing at bones" method, like the "ocean fleets," to manufacture a batch of large products, opening up a new path for the development of the machinery manufacturing industry. Now Jiulian's advanced experience and the experience of the "four without" buildings that do not use cement, steel, wood, bricks, or tiles have been spread throughout the country.
    Under the sunshine of the people's communes, the suburbs of Harbin present a scene of jubilation and prosperity. In the wheat harvest season, the fertile fields are shining with golden wheat waves, and vegetables and fruits exude an enticing fragrance. On the boundless fields, herds of cattle and sheep are grazing everywhere. The Songhua River's big white fish and mandarin fish are even more popular. In the severe winter when snow is flying, the mercury column of the thermometer can drop to more than thirty degrees below zero, but in the more than 200,000 square meters of greenhouses in the suburban people's communes, fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and chives can still be produced in large quantities as usual. From 1959, Harbin has reversed the situation of transporting vegetables from the south to the north and has begun to transport vegetables from the north to the south.
    Harbin is an industrial city, but also a city of science and culture. After liberation, not only were fifty-three modern scientific research institutions such as civil engineering, veterinary medicine, agriculture, and forestry established, but there were also thousands of mass scientific research organizations. Now, the city has more than 10,000 people specializing in scientific research. Armed with Marxism-Leninism, they are exploring the mysteries of nature and bravely climbing the peaks of science and technology. The number of universities in the city has developed from three in the past to twenty. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," a large number of new construction talents have been trained here.
    Harbin is also a pleasant and beautiful city with beautiful scenery. This is not only because it has undulating terrain, wide streets, and unique architectural complexes, but also because it is nestled on the banks of the beautiful and rich Songhua River. Whether it is residents who have lived in Harbin for a long time or new visitors, no one can help but be fascinated and amazed by the beautiful scenery of the Songhua River. The "Long Dyke Green Willow" on the south bank of the river is one of the famous scenic spots in the city. On the long dyke, there are dense poplars and weeping willows, colorful brocade flower beds, and various styles of artistic sculptures and pavilions, which are even more unique. The riverside pavilions attract countless tourists every day. Inside the railings, there are clear songs and graceful dances, and outside the railings, there are gurgling rivers and brocade-like waves. The north bank of the river is a summer resort and convalescent area. On the famous Sun Island, the trees are lush and green, and under the island, the white sand and blue water are a natural bathing pool for "washing feet for thousands of miles."
    The Songhua River is charming, lovely, tranquil, and graceful. When you see this beautiful scenery, how can people not recall the past, and how can they not be filled with endless emotion? The people of Harbin will never forget the tragic year of 1932. In that year, because Harbin was under the rule and enslavement of Japanese imperialism, floods savagely and unhinderedly ravaged most of Harbin. During the flood, how many people wandered the streets, how many families were separated, how many houses were destroyed, and how many people were deprived of their lives. This deep disaster still makes people feel lingering fear. After liberation, in 1953, 1956, and 1957, floods struck again and again, and were getting bigger year by year. In 1957, the highest water level reached 120.3 meters, which was 58 centimeters higher than the water level when Harbin was flooded in 1932. However, times have changed, and Harbin is no longer the Harbin of 1932. In front of the Party and the heroic people of Harbin, floods can no longer run rampant. The majestic hundred-mile long dyke will forever suppress the wind and waves. What the flood leaves to the people is not disaster, but the Flood Control Heroes Memorial Tower pointing to the clear sky, and another scenic spot in Harbin—"The Tower Suppresses the River Sky."
    Today, how many people go to see the copper wall and iron wall-like long dyke with a feeling of pride, and how many people come to admire this Flood Control Heroes Memorial Tower with a feeling of admiration. Because this is the glory and pride of the people of Harbin, and this is a symbol of the Party leading the people to a great victory.
    The summer in Harbin is beautiful, with streets, squares, and courtyards all lush and green, with shady trees and fragrant flowers, which are refreshing. The winter in Harbin is even more beautiful. In the season of "thousands of miles of ice and thousands of miles of snow," people skate and bathe in the snow, intoxicated and fascinated. The city, like green pines and cypresses, stands proudly in the wind and snow, revealing strength in its gracefulness and fortitude in its beauty, making it even more "wrapped in red and white, extraordinarily enchanting."
    Harbin—this industrial city on the banks of the Songhua River, the water of the Songhua River is flowing under her feet, and she is also moving forward non-stop. When you finish reading this short article here, she has already sped along the road leading to communism, dashing forward for hundreds of miles.

　　天鹅项下的一颗珍珠
　　吕其恩
    展开我国地图，在他的东北角上有一只矫健的天鹅，这是塞北的“天府之国”——黑龙江省。哈尔滨这座祖国北方的重要工业城市，如同一颗光华闪烁的珍珠一般，挂在天鹅的项下，镶嵌在富饶美丽的松花江之滨。在祖国悠久的历史上，她还是座年轻的城市，从开埠至今，不过只有六十几年。在解放前的漫长岁月里，她经历兵燹，饱受风霜，经受过帝俄的压榨，军阀的宰割，也备尝过日本帝国主义蹂躏的酸辛。在这里曾经充满了尖锐的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾。
    从1925年起，哈尔滨就有了中国共产党的地下组织。党像茫茫夜海中的灯塔，唤起了人们的希望，照亮了人们的心。英雄的哈尔滨在党的领导下，燃起了对敌斗争的火焰，斗争的烈火把她百炼成钢。
    哈尔滨是全国最早解放的第一座大城市。在解放战争年代，她支援三下江南四保临江，从这里运出了一批批的战略物资，有力地支援了全国解放的斗争。在和平建设时期，哈尔滨更是充满了青春活力，一日千里地向前飞驰，从根本上改变了过去的面貌。
    十多年以前，哈尔滨还是一个仅有几家“油酒米面”加工工业的纯消费城市，而今天却已经成为具有强大生产能力的祖国重要工业城市之一。千人以上的工厂，解放前只有两个，现在已经增加到七十八个，工业总产值，解放前只有四千万元，而到今年年底，就将完成四十亿元，增加几近一百倍。城市人口和房屋面积，也都比解放前成倍增加。气势宏伟的现代化工厂，一座又一座地连袂而起。在哈尔滨西南端九华里长的安乐街旁，更是厂房连着厂房。这里有哈尔滨电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂，这就是举国闻名的“动力之乡”。“动力之乡”的三大动力厂和电炭厂、电表仪器厂、电线厂、绝缘材料厂、电池厂，构成了强大的电力工业的体系。在这里能够生产重达千吨的电站设备，能够生产像七层楼房一样高大的电站锅炉和可以同时开进四辆大卡车的七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机。从这里生产出的巨型电站设备，供应了新安江、佛子岭、狮子滩、六郎洞等国家重点建设的需要。出自“动力之乡”的电站设备，已经开始在祖国各地发热发光。在“和平之路”这条解放后新建的、宽阔的柏油马路的两侧，像孪生姊妹一样矗立着哈尔滨的“两娇”——现代化的亚麻纺织厂和量具刃具厂。这样的大洋群，一群又一群布满了哈尔滨这座美丽的名城。在这里不仅能生产巨型的发电设备，也能生产比头发丝还细小的钻头和像米粒一样大小的精密轴承。当你站在各大厂的宏伟车间里，听到由天车运转声、马达轰鸣声所交织成的豪迈乐章，看到高压锅炉，水轮发电机等小山一般的庞然大物和各种精密工具源源生产出来的时候，就会使你感觉到浓郁的青春气息，谛听到祖国大跃进的足音。
    哈尔滨不仅有全新的“大洋群”，还有许多重要的技术创造，机联机械厂在一无大厂房、二无大机床、三无大吊车、四无大铸钢设备的“四无”情况下，创造出了“积木式”机床，用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，也和“大洋群”一样制造出了一批大型产品，给机械制造业的发展开辟了一条新途径。现在机联的先进经验和不用水泥、钢筋、木材、砖瓦的四不用大楼的经验，已经传播到全国各地。
    在人民公社的阳光普照下，哈尔滨郊区呈现一片欢腾和繁荣景象。在麦秋季节，肥沃的田野里闪耀着金黄色的麦浪，蔬菜瓜果散发着诱人的清香，在一望无际的原野上，到处牧放着成群的牛羊。松花江的大白鱼、鳌花鱼更是脍炙人口，在白雪纷飞的严冬，寒暑表的水银柱尽可降到零下三十多度，但是在郊区人民公社二十余万平方米的温室里，鲜嫩的黄瓜、西红柿、韭菜却照常可以大批大批地生产出来。从1959年起哈尔滨已经扭转了南菜北运的局面，开始了北菜南运。
    哈尔滨是座工业城，也是一座科学、文化城。解放后不仅建立起了五十三所土木、兽医、农林等现代化的科学研究机关，而且还有上千个群众性的科学研究组织。现在，全市专门从事科学研究工作的人员已达万余名。他们在马列主义的武装下，探索着自然界的奥秘，勇敢地向科学技术尖端攀登。全市高等学校已经由过去的三所发展到二十所。在党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针指导下，从这里培养出了大批新型建设人材。
    哈尔滨也是一座景色宜人，风光优美的城市。这不仅是因为它有着丘陵起伏的地形、宽阔的街道和独具风格的建筑群，而且因为她正是傍偎在美丽、富饶的松花江边。无论是久住哈尔滨的居民，还是新来这里的客人，谁也不能不为那美丽的松花江景色而留恋、赞叹。江南岸的“长堤绿柳”是全市著名的风景区之一，在长堤上，有茂密的白杨、垂柳，五光十色的锦绣花坛，各种式样的艺术雕塑、凉亭，更是别具风格。江上亭阁，每天都吸引着无数的游人。栏内清歌曼舞、人影婆娑，栏外则是潺潺的江流，波光似锦。江北岸是避暑和疗养胜地，在著名的太阳岛上绿树苍郁，岛下白沙碧水，是“濯足万里流”的天然浴池。
    松花江妩媚可爱而又恬静多娇。当看到这优美风光，人们怎能不回想过去，怎能不因此而引起无限感慨。哈尔滨的人永远不会忘掉悲惨的1932年。那一年，由于哈尔滨正处在日本帝国主义的统治奴役之下，洪水凶残地、毫无阻拦地洗劫了大半个哈尔滨。洪水期间，多少人流浪街头、多少人妻离子散、多少间房屋被冲毁、多少人被夺去了生命。这场深重的灾难，使人们至今犹心有余悸。解放后，1953年、1956年、1957年，洪水又连续袭来，而且是一年大过一年。1957年最高水位达到了一百二十点三米，比1932年淹没哈尔滨时的水位还高出五十八公分。但是，时代变了，哈尔滨已经不是1932年的哈尔滨了，在党的面前，在英雄的哈尔滨市人民面前，洪水再也不能肆虐了。巍峨的百里长堤永远镇住了风浪，洪水留给人们的不是灾难，而是指向睛空的防洪英雄纪念塔，而是哈尔滨市的又一名景——“塔镇江天”。
    今天，多少人怀着自豪的激情去看那铜墙铁壁般的长堤，多少人怀着敬慕的心来瞻仰这座防洪英雄纪念塔。因为这是哈尔滨市人民的光荣和骄傲，这是党领导人民走向伟大胜利的象征。
    哈尔滨的夏天是美丽的，街道、广场和庭院一片葱茏，绿树荫浓、花香馥郁，沁人心肺。哈尔滨的冬天就更加美丽，在“千里冰封，万里雪飘”的季节，人们滑冰、浴雪，心醉神陶。城市像苍松翠柏一样，傲然挺立在风雪里，婀娜中露出刚健、苍劲中带有俊秀，越发显得“红妆素裹，分外妖娆”。
    哈尔滨——这座松花江畔的工业城，松花江的水在她脚下不停地流着，她也在不停地前进。当你在这里读罢这篇短文的时候，她却已经沿着通向共产主义的大道，昂首疾驰，又向前冲出了百里以外。
