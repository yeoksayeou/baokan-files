Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: Staff on the commercial front in Hebei Province are combating Rightist tendencies and boosting morale, cooperating with people's communes in cotton-producing areas to launch a mass cotton purchase campaign of quick picking, quick harvesting, and quick transport. In September, they purchased over 2.06 million dan of ginned cotton, exceeding the month's plan by one-fold and increasing by three and a half times compared to the same period last year. The quality of the cotton has generally improved by half to one grade.

This year, Hebei Province has seen a general bumper harvest of cotton. Since September, more than 35,700 cotton purchasing personnel from commercial departments have gone deep into cotton-producing areas to carry out cotton purchase work. In order to support industrial production, people's communes have generally implemented the practice of picking, drying, selling, and transporting as soon as the cotton bolls open. More than one million people across the province, reaching a maximum of 1.7 million, are involved in cotton picking, selling, and transporting. Commune members have widely adopted methods such as double-bag cotton picking, separate picking by spray, and grading selection, which have improved the quality of the cotton. In order to ensure timely transportation, all available transportation tools in cotton-producing areas have been organized to participate in short-distance transportation, and methods such as using returning empty vehicles and incidental transportation have been adopted.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th: The first picking of cotton from Henan Province's more than 12 million mu of cotton fields has been basically completed, and various localities are now launching a concentrated effort to pick the second crop. Communes are quickly picking, drying, ginning, selling, and transporting. As of October 2nd, they had sold more than 2.53 million dan of ginned cotton to the state. The new ginned cotton is being continuously transported to Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and other places to supply cotton mills for spinning and weaving.

This year, the harvest of the first picking of cotton in Henan Province has generally exceeded previous years. Encouraged by the bumper harvest, communes are combating Rightist tendencies and boosting morale, vigorously engaging in mass movements to sell more, sell quickly, and sell good cotton to the state. In Zhecheng County, each commune organized two teams: one to pick good cotton during the day and the other to pick lower-quality cotton at night, separating the picking and selling. In the first ten days of September, among the 2.15 million jin of first-grade cotton sold to the state, 85% was grade four and 15% was grade three, with no cotton below grade five.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th: Farmers in the Guanzhong cotton region of Shaanxi are enthusiastically selling new cotton. As of October 2nd, communes across the province had sold 152,500 dan of ginned cotton to the state, greatly exceeding the purchase volume of the same period last year.

Communes are resolutely implementing the system of separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, separate ginning, and separate selling. They have also changed from picking cotton with the boll to picking cotton in the field and from drying cotton on the ground to drying cotton with mats. As a result, the grade of the cotton has generally improved by one grade compared to last year, generally being grade three or four or above. Cotton-producing area farmers have also devised many ways to speed up cotton ginning and selling. Commune members of the Liangcun Management District of the Liangcun Commune in Qian County fought day and night, converting all twenty-three manual cotton gins into animal-powered cotton gins, increasing ginning efficiency from 2,900 jin per day to 9,500 jin.

Various purchasing departments have taken many measures to accelerate the progress of cotton purchases. Relevant departments have also recently rushed to install 270 small saw-tooth cotton gins and distributed them to the communes to help them achieve quick ginning and quick selling. (Attached picture)

    快摘　快晒　快轧　快售　快运
    冀豫陕农民踊跃售新棉
    据新华社天津7日电　河北省商业战线职工反右倾、鼓干劲，配合棉区各人民公社展开了群众性的快摘、快收、快运的棉花收购运动，9月份收购皮棉二百零六万多担，超过这个月的计划一倍，比去年同期多三倍半，棉花质量普遍提高半级到一级。
    今年河北省的棉花普遍丰收。从9月份以来，商业部门三万五千七百多个棉花采购人员深入到产棉区去开展棉花收购工作。各人民公社为了支援工业生产，普遍实行随开、随摘、随晒、随交售、随运送。全省投入摘棉、售棉、运棉工作的每天有一百多万人，最多达到一百七十万人。社员们普遍推行了双袋摘棉、一喷分摘、按级选择的方法，提高了棉花质量。为了及时调运，各产棉区组织了一切可以利用的运输工具参加短途运输，并且采取了回空车运、捎脚运输等办法。
    据新华社郑州7日电　河南省一千二百多万亩棉田的头道花已经基本收摘完毕，各地正在突击采摘二道花。各公社快摘、快晒、快轧、快售、快运，到10月2日为止，已卖给国家皮棉二百五十三万多担。新皮棉正不断运往上海、郑州等地，供棉纺织厂纺纱织布。
    今年，河南省的棉花头道花的收摘量普遍超过往年。在大丰收的鼓舞下，各公社反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，多卖快卖好棉给国家。柘城县各公社组织两套人马，白天摘好棉，夜晚摘次质棉，分摘分售，9月上旬出售给国家的二百一十五万多斤头道花中，85％是四级、15％是三级，没有五级以下的棉花。
    据新华社西安7日电　陕西关中棉区农民踊跃出售新棉。截至10月2日，全省各公社已经卖给国家十五万二千五百担皮棉，大大超过去年同期的收购量。
    各公社坚决贯彻分拾、分晒、分存、分轧、分售的制度，并且改带壳摘花为田间拾花，改地上晒花为用席箔晒花，因此棉花的品级比去年普遍提高了一级，一般都在三、四级以上。棉区农民们还想了很多办法，来加快轧棉和售棉的速度。乾县梁村公社梁村管理区社员们日夜奋战，把二十三辆人力轧花车全部改成畜力轧花车，轧花效率由日轧二千九百斤提高到九千五百斤。
    各地收购部门采取了很多措施加快棉花收购进度。有关部门还在最近赶装了二百七十部小型锯齿轧花机，发到各公社，帮助各公社实现快轧快售。（附图片）
