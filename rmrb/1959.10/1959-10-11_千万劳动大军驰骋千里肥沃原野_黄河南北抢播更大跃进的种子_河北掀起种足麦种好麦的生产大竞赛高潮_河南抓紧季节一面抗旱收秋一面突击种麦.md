Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 10th: This year's winter wheat planting work in Hebei Province is proceeding early, quickly, and well. By October 5th, the province had sown over 23.3 million mu of wheat, accounting for more than 70% of the planned planting area, more than double the amount compared to the same period last year.

Since the joint initiative from five counties, including Anguo and Ningjin, to the entire province to plant wheat well, people's communes throughout the province have rapidly launched a production competition craze focused on planting enough wheat and planting it well. Platforms are being established everywhere, measures are being taken, and resolutions are being made, all competing for high yields. Many counties, such as Shulu, Ningjin, Xushui, Hengshui, Jixian, and Huailai, immediately engaged in county-to-county competitions, and more than 2,800 communes and production teams launched commune-to-commune and team-to-team competitions. The development of the competition movement has led to new scenes in many areas: high political enthusiasm, high production enthusiasm, high labor efficiency, and more attendance from commune members, more participation in production from cadres, and more advanced deeds, prompting wheat sowing to be both fast and good. In the Handan area, more than one million people launched a competition to plant wheat well and plant enough of it. The entire area quickly completed sowing more than 6.6 million mu of wheat, accounting for 74.1% of the planting plan. The vast majority of the wheat sown met the required specifications.

To achieve an even greater harvest next year, all communes and production teams have established ambitious goals, determined to plant all wheat on irrigated land. To this end, cadres and commune members from many communes have camped in the fields, fighting day and night. Currently, a larger-scale water conservancy construction upsurge centered on wheat planting is forming throughout the province. Before planting wheat, a specialized water conservancy construction team of more than 70,000 commune members in Ningjin County had drilled 458 mechanized wells, 920 brick wells, repaired 200 old wells, and opened 31 canals, transforming 130,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. This county plans to plant 930,000 mu of wheat this year, with a yield requirement doubling that of this year.

In wheat planting, all localities not only pay attention to planting enough wheat but also take various measures to plant wheat well. The people's communes in many areas have uniformly allocated labor and organized specialized teams for plowing, fertilizer delivery, and sowing. Many lands are deeply plowed to six or seven inches, and some are deeply plowed to eight or nine inches. Many low-lying alkaline lands have been improved while being deeply plowed. Because all localities seized fertilizer accumulation in advance, the base fertilizer for wheat fields generally reached about 5,000 jin per mu, with some reaching more than 10,000 jin per mu, and the quality of fertilizer has also improved significantly. On the basis of summarizing the experience of large-area, high-yield fields last year, various localities also carried out meticulous land preparation and square-area ridging. According to statistics from five special districts and cities, including Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Handan, the area of ​​large-area, high-yield demonstration plots reached 11.87 million mu, accounting for 36% of the wheat field area of the five special districts and cities. In order to further improve the quality of wheat planting, many areas held symposiums with experienced farmers before sowing, formulated sowing regulations, and trained a large number of drill operators and technicians. They used the method of contracting teams and plots of land to check one (check preparation) and sow one, sow one and accept one, and immediately solve any problems found to ensure that the application of base fertilizer and rational close planting meet the requirements.

Currently, fifteen counties (cities) in the province have completed the planting plan, and general counties and cities are also close to completing the plan. While planting wheat, many areas have also launched a "five check" campaign to check every plot and every ridge, fill one ridge if one is missing, and fill one seedling if one is missing (checking water, fertilizer, density, implementation of the three responsibilities, and large-area high-yield plots). They are determined to eliminate the three types of seedlings during the sowing stage and lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 10th: Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commune members in various parts of Henan Province are seizing the season to carry out a shock campaign to plant wheat. Every day, more than 20 million laborers in the province are simultaneously seizing drought resistance to protect autumn crops and harvest them, and are also seizing autumn plowing to plant wheat. As of October 8th, the province's wheat planting area has reached 34,722,000 mu, accounting for 51.2% of the planned area. Kaifeng and Xinxiang special districts, which planted early, have completed more than 70% of the planting plan.

This year's wheat planting work in Henan Province began in the context of a great harvest achieved after a arduous struggle against drought to protect autumn crops. Under this excellent situation, various localities actively expanded the wheat planting area, increased the yield per unit area, and strived to increase the total wheat output next year. The province guarantees an autumn sowing area of 80 million mu, striving for 82 million mu, an expansion of 5 million mu compared to last year's 75 million mu.

In order to plant enough and plant well, all localities not only started early and prepared adequately, but also adopted measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density progressing simultaneously, so that the quality of sowing was generally improved. Especially after the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency instruction in August to further develop water conservancy construction to ensure a bumper autumn harvest and plant wheat well without rain, all communes adopted different measures according to local conditions and tried every possible means to expand the irrigation area. More abundant and sufficient water sources were prepared for wheat sowing. From mid-July to the end of September, more than 370,000 canals were excavated and renovated throughout the province, 3,840 reservoirs were built, 1,394,000 spring eyes were dug, more than 125,000 river-blocking dams were renovated, and more than 163,000 new waterwheels and more than 7,100 power irrigation machines were added, improving and expanding the irrigation area by a total of more than 21 million mu. Currently, in addition to the Xinyang, Nanyang, and Xinxiang regions, where there is moisture due to rainfall and they are seizing the moisture to plant quickly, there are still 25 million mu of wheat in the province that need to be planted while fighting drought. The broad masses are searching for water sources everywhere on the mountains and down the gullies, and launching a drought-resistant wheat planting campaign with the same energy as drought-resistant autumn crop protection. The masses in Zhenping County proposed: "Store all the water above ground, dig out the underground springs, fiercely attack the eight major rivers, and fight the Funiu Mountains, to ensure a good wheat planting season!" The whole county sends out more than 91,000 laborers every day to excavate water springs, canals, and build river-blocking dams, expanding the irrigation area by more than 70,000 mu within half a month. In the Kaifeng special district, which irrigates with the Yellow River, 1.7 million laborers have been mobilized every day since September to actively open canals, build sluice gates, and dig wells. As of October 6th, the entire district has improved and expanded the irrigation area by more than 3.7 million mu.

The quality of deep plowing, fertilization, and prevention of underground insects is also very good. The province has already autumn-plowed 63,992,000 mu, with 74% being deeply plowed to more than eight inches, and an average of about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer is applied per mu. In deep plowing and fertilization, the superiority of the people's commune has been fully utilized. Large-scale operations have been universally implemented in various localities, and socialist large-scale cooperation has been combined with specialized labor. At the same time, tool reforms have been carried out in a big way, achieving simultaneous harvesting, fertilization, deep plowing, and sowing.

The area of ​​garden-style fields in various places has expanded compared to last year, and the quality is also high. This is a prominent feature of this year's wheat planting work. The province has already leveled and ridged 38,968,000 mu. The Xinxiang special district requires that the area of ​​garden-style fields account for 80% of the 13 million mu of autumn sowing area in the entire district; advanced garden-style fields should reach 50%. Of the 13 million mu of autumn sowing area in the Xuchang special district, 6 million mu must achieve advanced garden-style fields, and mountainous areas must achieve terraced fields, and concave areas must achieve ditch and ridge terraced fields, truly achieving drought irrigation and flood drainage, uniform irrigation and thorough irrigation, and achieving guaranteed harvests in both drought and flood.

Eliminating the three types of seedlings during the sowing period is an important measure taken by Henan Province to ensure increased wheat production. This year, the province's late-stage autumn sowing area accounts for about one-quarter of the autumn sowing plan. In order to change the situation that late-stage yields have been lower than early-stage yields in the past, many counties have proposed the requirement that late-stage yields exceed early-stage yields. For example, the Sui County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed: For late-stage land, we must simultaneously clear stubble, fertilize, deep plow, prepare land to make ridges, and sow. It is required that all land be deeply plowed to more than one foot to achieve garden-style fields. Every mu should apply 3,000 to 5,000 jin more fertilizer than early-stage land, and 310,000 jin of seed dressing agents have been prepared. (Attached Pictures)

Henan launches autumn sowing battle, and party secretaries at all levels personally come to the front line to direct operations.

　　千万劳动大军驰骋千里肥沃原野
    黄河南北抢播更大跃进的种子
    河北掀起种足麦种好麦的生产大竞赛高潮
    河南抓紧季节一面抗旱收秋一面突击种麦
    据新华社天津10日电　河北省今年的冬麦播种工作进行得又早又快又好。到10月5日，全省已播种小麦二千三百三十多万亩，占播种计划70％以上，比去年同期快一倍多。
    全省各地人民公社自安国、宁晋等五县联合向全省发出种好小麦的竞赛倡议后，就迅速掀起了以种足麦、种好麦为内容的生产竞赛高潮，到处立擂台，抓措施，比决心，赛高产。束鹿、宁津、徐水、衡水、蓟县、怀来等许多县立即投入县与县的竞赛，还有二千八百多个公社和生产队展开社与社、队与队的竞赛，竞赛运动的开展使许多地区出现了政治热情高、生产积极性高、劳动效率高和社员出勤多、干部参加生产多、先进事迹多的新气象，促使小麦播种得既快又好。邯郸地区有一百多万人展开了种好麦、种足麦的竞赛，全区很快完成播种小麦六百六十多万亩，占播种计划的74.1％，播种的小麦绝大部分都达到了规格要求。
    各个公社和生产队为了实现明年的更大丰收，都树立了雄心大志，决心把全部小麦播种在水浇地里，为此许多公社的干部和社员都到田间扎营，日夜奋战。目前一个以种麦为中心的更大规模的水利建设高潮正在全省各地形成。宁晋县七万多社员组成的水利建设专业队，在种麦以前，就打好机井四百五十八眼，砖井九百二十眼，修旧井二百眼，开渠三十一道，使十三万亩旱地变成水浇地。这个县今年计划种小麦九十三万亩，亩产要求比今年增加一倍。
    各地在小麦播种中，不仅注意把麦种足，还采取各种措施把麦种好。许多地区的人民公社都统一调配劳力，组织了翻地、送肥、播种专业队，许多土地深翻达到六、七寸，有的深翻八、九寸。不少的洼碱地在深翻地的同时，进行了土壤改良。由于各地事先就大抓积肥，现在麦田的底肥一般都达到了每亩五千斤左右，多者有的每亩达到万斤以上，肥料的质量也都有显著提高。在总结去年大面积高额丰产田的经验基础上，各地还进行了精细的整地和划方作畦等工作。据天津、保定、石家庄、唐山、邯郸等五个专区、市的统计，建立大面积高额丰产方的面积达一千一百八十七万亩，占五个专区、市麦田面积的36％。许多地区为了进一步提高种麦的质量，在播种前都召开了老农座谈会，制定播种规程，并且训练了大批的耧把手、技术员，他们用包队、包地块办法，查一块（查准备）播一块，播一块验收一块，发现问题立即解决，保证在施底肥和合理密植等工作方面都合乎要求。
    现在，全省已经有十五个县（市）完成了播种计划，一般的县市也都接近完成计划。许多地区在播种小麦的同时，还掀起了一个块块到、垅垅查，缺一垅、补一垅，缺一棵、补一棵的五查（水、肥、密、三包落实、大面积丰产方）运动，他们决心要把三类苗消灭在播种阶段，给明年大丰收打下良好基础。
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省各地人民公社社员，在党的八届八中全会决议鼓舞下，正抓紧季节开展突击种麦高潮。全省每天都有两千多万劳动大军，一面大抓抗旱保秋和收秋，一面大抓秋耕种麦。到10月8日止，全省小麦播种面积已达三千四百七十二万二千亩，占计划面积51.2％。播种早的开封、新乡两专区，已完成播种计划70％以上。
    河南省今年的种麦工作，是在经过艰巨的抗旱保秋斗争获得大丰收的形势下开始的。在这个大好形势下面，各地积极扩大小麦种植面积，提高单位面积产量，努力增加明年的小麦总产量。全省保证秋播面积八千万亩，争取八千二百万亩，比去年的七千五百万亩扩大五百万亩。
    为了种足种好，各地不仅动手早、准备充分，而且都采取了水、肥、土、种、密等齐头并进的措施，使播种质量普遍提高。特别是在中共河南省委、河南省人民委员会8月发出进一步开展水利建设，保证秋季丰收和无雨种好小麦的紧急指示以后，各公社都因地制宜地采取不同措施，千方百计地扩大灌溉面积，为小麦播种准备了更多更足的水源。从7月中旬到9月底止，全省开挖和整修渠道三十七万多条，修水库三千八百四十座，挖泉眼一百三十九万四千多个，整修拦河坝十二万五千多处，新添水车十六万三千多部、动力灌溉机械七千一百多台，共改善和扩大灌溉面积两千一百多万亩。现在，除信阳、南阳、新乡地区因降雨有墒，趁墒抢种以外，全省还有二千五百万亩小麦需要抗旱播种。广大群众都以抗旱保秋的劲头，上山下沟，到处寻找水源，展开抗旱种麦运动。镇平县群众提出：“蓄尽地上水，挖出地下泉，猛攻八大河，大战伏牛山，保证过好小麦播种关！”全县每天出动九万一千多劳力开挖水泉、渠道和筑拦河坝，在半月之内扩大灌溉面积七万多亩。引黄灌溉的开封专区，9月份以来，每天出动一百七十万劳力，积极开渠、建闸、打井，到10月6日，全区已改善和扩大灌溉面积三百七十多万亩。
    在深翻、施肥、防治地下虫方面，质量也都很好。全省已秋耕六千三百九十九万二千亩，深翻八寸以上的占74％，每亩平均施底肥一万斤左右。在深翻、施肥中，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，各地普遍实行了大兵团作战的方法，开展社会主义大协作与专业劳力结合，同时大搞工具改革，做到了边收、边施肥、边深翻、边播种。
    各地园田化面积都比去年扩大，质量也高。这是今年小麦播种工作中的一个显著特点。全省已平地整畦三千八百九十六万八千亩。新乡专区要求全区一千三百万亩秋播面积中，园田化面积占80％；高级园田化达到50％。许昌专区的一千三百万亩秋播面积，要有六百万亩实现高级园田化，山岗地区实现梯田化，凹地实现沟洫台田化，真正达到旱能浇，涝能排，浇匀浇透，实现旱涝保丰收。
    把三类苗消灭在播种期间，是河南省保证小麦增产的一项重要措施。今年，全省晚茬秋播面积约占秋播计划的四分之一，为了改变历年来晚茬不如早茬产量高的情况，许多县都提出了晚茬超早茬的要求。如中共睢县县委提出：晚茬地要做到边腾茬、边施肥、边深翻、边整地打畦、边播种，要求全部深翻一尺以上，达到园田化，每亩要比早茬地多施三千至五千斤肥，并准备了拌种药剂三十一万斤。（附图片）
