    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th: "Lao Patriotic News," published on October 22nd, carried the "Letter to the Lao People" from the recently concluded Third National Congress of the Lao Patriotic Front, calling on all Lao people who love their country and peace to unite wholeheartedly and wage a national salvation struggle against American interference and the traitorous policies that harm the country and the people of the Phoui Sananikone clique and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

    The Letter to the People emphasizes that "The struggle for peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, national harmony, national unification, and against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is a long-term, arduous, and self-reliant struggle. However, in this struggle, we have the united strength of the people of the whole country, wise leadership and a correct line, and the strong support of the peace-loving people of the world. Final victory will surely belong to us."

    In the Letter to the People, the Third National Congress of the Lao Patriotic Front demands the strict and thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and Vientiane Agreements, the immediate cessation of the civil war, the immediate cessation of mopping-up operations, the burning of houses and villages, and the killing of people, and the immediate restoration of the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

    The Letter to the People once again demands the resumption of the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos, the reconvening of the conference of participating countries in the 1954 Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Lao issue, opposes the dispatch of a "Fact-Finding Sub-Committee" to Laos by the United Nations Security Council, opposes the interference of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in Laos, and demands that U.S. military personnel and weapons be removed from Laos.

    The Letter to the People demands an immediate end to interference in the Lao People's Liberation Army and the suppression, retaliation, and discrimination against former resistance personnel, the immediate release of cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front and former resistance personnel who are being imprisoned, the guarantee of the people's democratic freedoms, the restoration and safeguarding of the open and legal activities of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Peace and Neutrality Committee, respect for the National Assembly and the current constitution, the establishment of a coalition government with representatives from the Lao Patriotic Front, all progressive parties, and all ethnic groups, respect for and strict implementation of the regulations on the administrative organization of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces as stipulated in the agreements reached by both sides, the sincere implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality, and the establishment of friendly relations with countries of different political and social systems on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and mutual assistance in the spirit of Bandung, the improvement of the lives of the people of all ethnic groups, the abolition of orders for conscription, requisition, plunder, forced labor, and press-ganging, opposition to the policy of economic dependence on U.S. imperialism, the abolition of the trade privileges of pro-American groups, the construction of an independent and prosperous economy, and the acceptance of economic assistance from all countries willing to help Laos without any constraints, opposition to American-style decadent culture, the development of national culture, respect for Buddhism, and respect for the traditional customs of the nation.

    In the Letter to the People, the Congress of the Lao Patriotic Front also expresses respect and mourning for the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the glorious cause of the nation; expresses heartfelt thanks and utmost trust to Prince Souphanouvong, the beloved leader of the Lao people and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, who is being imprisoned by the U.S.-Sananikone clique; and extends cordial greetings to the Lao compatriots and suffering families who have been arrested and persecuted by the U.S.-Sananikone clique. The Letter to the People also praises the resolute and unyielding fighting spirit of the cadres, soldiers, militiamen, guerrillas, and all the people.

    The Letter to the People exposes the crimes of the U.S.-Sananikone clique in provoking the Lao civil war in an attempt to eliminate the revolutionary forces in Laos and turn Laos into a military base and new colony of U.S. imperialism. The Letter to the People points out that U.S. imperialism has openly dispatched hundreds of officers to Laos to directly train and command the Lao army, while transporting large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies into Laos to expand the Lao civil war.

    Recently, they fabricated the lie of "communist aggression," presented the Lao issue to the United Nations, and introduced a "Fact-Finding Sub-Committee" into Laos, plotting to prepare conditions for the armed intervention of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Laos.

    The Letter to the People goes on to say that, in the past period, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people's struggle movement has grown and strengthened throughout the country. Wherever the U.S.-Sananikone clique carries out suppression and massacres, the masses rise up in fierce struggle. Many soldiers in the Royal Government army who love their country and peace have joined the ranks of the people to oppose the U.S.-Sananikone clique. Therefore, in this struggle, the Lao people have already achieved great victories in many ways.

    The Letter to the People emphasizes that "At present, everyone can see that our nation has two paths to choose from: one is to expand the civil war, allow U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to strengthen their military intervention in Laos, destroy the Geneva Accords and Vientiane Agreements, and eliminate the Lao forces that love their country and peace, in order to turn our country into a war base of U.S. imperialism. This is the road to national subjugation and national annihilation; the other is the road of struggling for the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and Vientiane Agreements, the road of peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, national harmony, and national unification; the road of liberating the Lao nation from the scourge of war and bringing happiness to the people.

    The Letter to the People points out that the second path is the path of struggle that the Lao Patriotic Front has always followed and is also the path of our people. Despite the full efforts of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to undermine the peace and sovereignty of the Lao people, the Lao Patriotic Front, loyal to the interests of the motherland, firmly stands its ground and strives to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos on the basis of national harmony and national unification.

    The Letter to the People earnestly calls on people throughout the world who love peace and justice to support the just struggle of the Lao people, to oppose U.S. imperialist intervention in Laos, and to oppose the policies of the Phoui Sananikone clique that harm the country and the people.

    老挝爱国战线党代表大会发出响亮号召
    坚决反对美萨集团的罪恶政策
    要求彻底履行日内瓦协议和万象协议
    新华社河内28日电　10月22日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”发表了最近闭幕的老挝爱国战线党第三次全国代表大会告老挝人民书，号召所有爱祖国、爱和平的老挝人一心一意团结起来，进行反对美国干涉、反对培·萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们的卖国殃民政策的救国斗争。
    告人民书强调说，“为和平、中立、独立、民主、民族和睦、国家统一、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争是长期的、艰巨的、自力更生的斗争。但是，在这个斗争中，我们有全国人民的团结力量，有英明的领导和正确的路线，有世界爱好和平人民大力的支持，最后的胜利一定属于我们。”
    老挝爱国战线党第三次全国代表大会在告人民书中，要求严正和彻底履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，要求立即停止内战，立即停止扫荡、焚烧房屋和村庄以及杀害人民的行动，要求立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由。
    告人民书再一次要求恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议以和平解决老挝问题；反对联合国安全理事会向老挝派遣“调查小组委员会”；反对美帝国主义和它的帮凶对老挝的干涉，要求美国军事人员和武器运出老挝。
    告人民书要求立即停止对寮国战斗部队的干涉和前抗战人员的镇压、报复和歧视，立即释放正被监禁的老挝爱国战线党的干部和前抗战人员；要求保证人民的民主自由，恢复和保障老挝爱国战线党和保卫和平中立委员会的公开和合法的活动；要求尊重国民议会和现行宪法；要求成立有老挝爱国战线党、各进步政党和各民族的代表参加的联合政府；要求尊重和严正履行双方达成的协议中有关桑怒、丰沙里两省行政组织规章的规定；要求真诚地实行和平中立的政策，在平等的、互相尊重独立主权、本着万隆精神互相帮助的基础上同不同政治、社会制度的国家建立友好关系；要求改善各族人民的生活，废除征收、征用、掠夺、拉夫、抓丁等命令；反对在经济上依附美帝国主义的政策，取消亲美集团的贸易特权，建设独立的、繁荣的经济，在不受任何约束的条件下接受愿意帮助老挝的所有国家的经济援助；反对美国式的堕落文化、发展民族文化；尊重佛教，尊重民族的淳风美俗。
    老挝爱国战线党代表大会在告人民书中还向那些为了民族的光荣事业而英勇牺牲的烈士表示敬意和哀悼；向正被美—萨集团监禁的老挝人民的敬爱领袖、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王表示衷心谢意和无比信任；向被美—萨集团逮捕、迫害的老挝同胞和受难的家庭致以亲切的慰问。告人民书还赞扬了干部、战士、民兵、游击队和全体人民的坚决不屈的斗争精神。
    告人民书揭露了美萨集团为了企图消灭老挝的革命力量、把老挝变成美帝国主义的军事基地和新的殖民地而挑起老挝内战的罪行。告人民书指出，美帝国主义已经露骨地派遣数百名军官到老挝，直接训练和指挥老挝军队，同时把大批武器、弹药和军用物资运进老挝，扩大老挝内战。
    最近，他们制造所谓“共产党侵略”的谎言，向联合国提出老挝问题，把“调查小组委员会”引进老挝，阴谋为美帝国主义和它在东南亚条约组织中的走狗武装干涉老挝准备条件。
    告人民书接着说，在过去期间里，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，老挝人民在全国范围内的斗争运动日益发展和壮大。美萨集团在哪里进行镇压、屠杀，哪里的群众就起来进行激烈的斗争。王国政府军队中的许多爱祖国、爱和平的士兵已经投向人民的队伍里来，反对美萨集团。因此，在这个斗争中，老挝人民已经在许多方面获得了巨大胜利。
    告人民书着重指出，“当前每个人可以看到我们民族有两条道路可走：一条是扩大内战，让美帝国主义和它在东南亚条约组织中的走狗加强对老挝的军事干涉，破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，消灭老挝爱祖国、爱和平的力量，以便把我国变成美帝国主义的战争基地。这是亡国的、民族灭亡的道路；另一条是为严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议而斗争的道路，和平、中立、独立、民主、民族和睦、统一国家的道路；使老挝民族摆脱战争灾祸，给人民带来幸福的道路。
    告人民书指出，第二条道路是老挝爱国战线党一向遵循的斗争道路，也是我国人民的道路。尽管美帝国主义及其走狗全力破坏老挝人民的和平和主权，但是，忠于祖国利益的老挝爱国战线党坚信无疑地站稳自己的立场，为在民族和睦和国家统一的基础上，建设和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而斗争。
    告人民书恳切地呼吁世界爱好和平和公理的人士支持老挝人民的正义斗争，反对美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，反对培·萨纳尼空集团的祸国殃民的政策。
