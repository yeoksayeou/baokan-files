Qinghai Lake is located in the northeastern part of Qinghai Province. It is a plateau lake with an area of more than 4,200 square kilometers, and it is also the largest saltwater lake in China. Its water surface is more than 3,000 meters above sea level.

Qinghai Lake is rich in naked carp (scaleless, with tender and delicious meat and rich in fat). According to preliminary investigations, its reserves, not including the amount of breeding, can be fished at 50,000 tons per year for more than 40 years. This year, the Qinghai Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has established fishing grounds at the mouths of rivers around the lake, such as the Dalamage River, Buha River, and Liusha River.

At present, the autumn is crisp, and it is the season when the water of Qinghai Lake is clear and the fish are fat. On the lake, boats come and go, and songs of celebration of the harvest rise and fall.

This year's catch of naked carp is already equivalent to four times the amount caught last year, far exceeding the total amount of beef and mutton supplied to the Qinghai Province market last year; at the same time, a large number of naked carp are transferred to Beijing, Tianjin, Gansu, Liaoning and other places.

    青海湖水产事业的青春
    青海湖位于青海省东北部，是一个四千二百多平方公里的高原湖泊，也是我国最大的咸水湖，她的水面拔海三千米以上。
    青海湖盛产湟鱼（无鳞、肉味鲜嫩、脂肪丰富），据初步调查，它的蕴藏量如果不把繁殖量计算在内，每年捕捞五万吨，可以捕捞四十多年。今年青海省水产局在湖周围的大喇嘛河、布哈河、流沙河等河口建立了渔场。
    目前秋高气爽，正是青海湖水清鱼肥季节。湖上，船只往来如梭，欢庆丰收的歌声此起彼落。
    今年湟鱼的捕获量已经相当于去年捕获量的四倍，远远超过了去年青海省市场上供应牛羊肉的总量；同时有大批湟鱼调往北京、天津、甘肃、辽宁等地。（附图片）
