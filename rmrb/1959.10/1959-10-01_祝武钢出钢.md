    Congratulating Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation on Producing Steel
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    On the eve of the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the No. 1 open-hearth furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) produced its first batch of molten steel. This is the best gift from all the workers of WISCO to this solemn national holiday. This new victory in the construction of WISCO marks a new stage in both construction and production, indicating that the foundation of its steelmaking system has been initially established. It has moved from iron production to steel production, and the second large-scale iron and steel production base in our country has begun to take shape. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace is a modern large-scale 250-ton open-hearth furnace with an annual steel output of more than 200,000 tons. In its construction, the requirements of high speed, good quality, and low cost were achieved. The completion and commissioning time was more than nine months ahead of the original plan, and more than 30 days ahead of the Great Leap Forward construction plan. The construction cost, just for the foundation sand and gravel cushion project, saved 4.5 million yuan compared with the general concrete piling method, equivalent to 35% of the original design investment. WISCO has achieved high-speed construction achievements, which is the glory of all WISCO builders and the glory of the people from all over the country who supported WISCO. One reason why WISCO's construction was relatively fast was the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union. Here, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the Soviet experts!
    Since WISCO officially started construction in 1956, the No. 1 blast furnace was completed and produced iron in September 1958. The construction time of the No. 1 blast furnace was fourteen months and thirteen days, more than ten months ahead of the state plan, and the quality was excellent. In July of this year, the No. 2 blast furnace was also completed and put into production. The construction time of the No. 2 blast furnace was only 140 days, which was an even greater leap forward. Now, WISCO's No. 1 open-hearth furnace has produced steel more than nine months ahead of schedule. WISCO's continuous leap forward proves that we can completely develop socialist construction at a high speed. The engineering of WISCO's steelmaking system is arduous and complex. It is equipped with the world's latest technology and has a high degree of automation. The furnace roof temperature, furnace pressure, and the adjustment of the reversing system are all automated. The operating procedures for construction and installation are very strict. However, most of those participating in the construction of the open-hearth furnace were novices. At the same time, they also encountered problems of insufficient raw materials and equipment. Obviously, all these were serious difficulties. However, the builders of WISCO did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. Especially under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the workers were even more motivated, and finally overcame the difficulties, enabling the No. 1 open-hearth furnace to produce steel ahead of schedule. Under the education and encouragement of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party's general line has been further deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people is soaring, and the wave of the Great Leap Forward is getting higher and higher. The example of WISCO's high-speed construction also proves that difficulties can be completely overcome. The key issue lies in opposing right-leaning ideas and encouraging greater efforts.
    We have just congratulated Baotou Iron and Steel Corporation (Baogang), the steel city beyond the Great Wall, on the production of iron from its No. 1 blast furnace, and now we are pleased to hear that WISCO's No. 1 open-hearth furnace in the south of the Yangtze River has produced steel. Good news from Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel Group Corporation) and other steel plants is frequently reported. All these indicate that the situation on the iron and steel front in our country is extremely good. However, our future tasks are still very heavy. Comrades of WISCO, all comrades on the iron and steel front, let us, under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously sum up experience, continue to oppose right-leaning thinking, hold high the red flag of the general line, muster greater efforts, and complete the plan to produce 12 million tons of steel this year ahead of schedule!

    在伟大的建国十周年的前夕，武钢一号平炉流出了第一炉钢水。这是武钢全体职工向这个庄严的全民节日的最好的献礼。武钢建设中的这个新的胜利，标志着武钢在建设和生产方面都跨进了一个新阶段，说明它炼钢系统的基础已初步建成，由产铁走向产钢，我国第二个大型钢铁生产的基地，已经初具规模了。一号平炉是个二百五十吨的现代化的大型平炉，年产钢二十多万吨。在建设中，实现了速度快、质量好、成本低的要求。建成和投入生产的时间，比原定计划提前了九个多月，比大跃进的施工计划提前了三十多天，建设成本仅基础沙石垫层工程即比一般用的混凝土打桩方法节约了四百五十万元，相当于原设计投资的35％。武钢取得了高速度建设的成就，这是武钢全体建设者的光荣，也是支援武钢的各地人民的光荣。武钢的建设所以能比较快的一个原因是伟大苏联的无私援助，在这里我们向苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联专家致衷心的感谢！
    自从1956年武钢正式动工兴建以来，1958年9月，一号高炉建成出铁。一号高炉的建设时间是十四个月零十三天，比国家计划提前了十个多月，而且质量优良。今年7月，二号高炉又建成投入生产，二号高炉的建成时间仅一百四十天，是个更大的跃进，现在，武钢一号平炉又提前九个多月出钢。武钢这种不断的跃进，证明了我们完全可以高速度地发展社会主义建设。武钢的炼钢系统的工程艰巨复杂，它是采用世界最新技术装备起来的，自动化程度很高。炉顶温度、炉膛压力，以及变向系统的调整等等都是自动化的。建筑和安装的操作规程要求十分严格。但参加建设平炉的大都是新手，同时，他们还遇到了原材料和设备不足的问题。显然，所有这些都是严重的困难。但是武钢的建设者没有在困难面前低头，特别是党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，全体职工的干劲更足，终于克服了困难，使一号平炉提前出钢。在党的八届八中全会精神的教育和鼓舞下，党的总路线进一步深入人心，广大群众干劲冲天，大跃进的浪潮越来越高。武钢高速度建设的事例也证明：困难是完全可以克服的，关键的问题在于反右倾鼓干劲。
    我们刚刚祝贺过塞外钢城——包钢一号高炉出铁，现在又喜闻江南的武钢一号平炉出钢。鞍钢和其他一些钢厂的生产捷报频传，所有这些说明我国钢铁战线上的形势极为良好，但是我们今后的任务仍然很大，武钢的职工同志们，钢铁战线上的全体同志们，让我们在党的领导下，认真总结经验，继续反对右倾思想，高举总路线红旗，鼓起更大干劲，提前完成今年产钢一千二百万吨的计划！
