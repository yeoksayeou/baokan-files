Ode to the People's Commune
A round of rising sun ascends gradually from the East,
Look at the rosy clouds filling the sky and the joyous surging of the sea;
Gazing at the beautiful scenery on the eastern horizon of Asia,
The People's Commune is truly an unfading star.

The People's Commune has the force of thunder and boundless power,
It rumbles and the earth trembles;
Along the Yangtze River and tracing the Yellow River, songs fill the air,
Driving away the poor ghosts and seeing off the plague gods, ten thousand banners greet the wind.

Lofty mountains are always continuous,
The mighty rivers and lakes accommodate thousands of streams;
The historical giant wheel of the Great Leap Forward rolls forward,
The steeds running abreast are prancing and leaping.

The People's Commune is definitely not falling from the sky,
Life and aspirations are the soil that nurtured it;
The Party and the leader affirmed this correct direction,
Thus, it is like the clang of metal and stone, like the soaring of an eagle.

The People's Commune is the east wind bringing spring back to the earth,
Under the caress of the east wind, people's enthusiasm surges:
Sharp silver hoes split the solid strata of the earth,
Deep ploughed land reveals a patch of moisture;
Timber from the mountains floats down the swift currents,
Swift currents bring ten thousand bright lights to the mountains;
The raging fire of the blast furnace makes the evening glow pale,
Birds circling in the sky lose their way home;
Silver hairpins reflect the green waves as women go out to sea to fish,
Planting fruit trees on the top of the mountain, borrowing white clouds as a ladder;
Unlimited talent and labor burst forth together,
Raising a glass to invite Li Bai, peasant poets compete in a contest.

The People's Commune has established its footing in China,
It is a giant with a sound mind and body,
Its hands are creating wondrous miracles,
Iron shoulders bear the heavy responsibility of opening up history.

Facing the overwhelming momentum of the people,
Those who vainly try to stop the chariot with a mantis's arm, or an ant trying to shake a big tree,
Their fate of failure is already doomed,
The People's Commune has luxuriant branches and leaves and a solid foundation!

Imperialism initially cursed the oriental dragon,
Later, they said Party member poets fabricated myths,
Go take a breath or chirp and chatter,
We want to sing and add flowers to the brocade for the commune.

    颂人民公社
    韩北屏一轮旭日从东方冉冉地上升，看霞光满天海涛欢乐地奔腾；仰望亚洲东部地平线上丽景，人民公社方才是不落的星辰。人民公社势如雷霆威力无穷，他轰隆隆而来大地为之震动；沿长江溯黄河一片歌声载道，赶穷鬼送瘟神万面旌旗迎风。巍峨的山岳总归是连绵不断，浩荡的江湖容纳了万水千川；大跃进的历史巨轮滚滚向前，并肩齐辔的骏马正扬鬃飞跃。人民公社绝对不是从天而降，生活和愿望是培育他的土壤；党和领袖肯定了这正确方向，于是像金石铿锵像雄鹰飞翔。人民公社是东风使大地回春，东风吹拂下人们的干劲陡增：锋利的银锄劈开坚实的地层，深翻的土地展现出一片滋润；山间的林木顺急湍飘流而下，急湍给山间带来了万盏明灯；高炉的烈火使晚霞黯然失色，盘旋天际的飞鸟迷失了归程；银簪映碧波是妇女捕鱼出海，山顶栽果树借白云作个梯阶；无限的才情和劳动一起迸发，举杯邀李白农民诗人摆擂台。人民公社在中国站定了脚跟，是一个智慧体魄健全的巨人，他的双手创造着神妙的奇迹，铁肩上担负开辟历史的重任。面对着人民排山倒海的声势，螳臂妄想当车蚍蜉摇撼大树，他们失败的命运早已经注定，人民公社枝繁叶茂根基永固！帝国主义最初诅咒东方巨龙，后来又说党员诗人编造神话，去你的歇口气或是吱吱喳喳，我们要歌唱为公社锦上添花。
