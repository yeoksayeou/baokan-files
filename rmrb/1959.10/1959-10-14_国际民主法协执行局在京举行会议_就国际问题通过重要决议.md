Shen Junru delivered an opening speech at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to the leaders of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, headed by Mr. Pritt, for attending the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country and holding the Executive Bureau meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Beijing. He expressed his admiration for the significant achievements made by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in its work.

During the three-day meeting, the Executive Bureau extensively exchanged views on major events occurring around the world from a legal perspective.

The meeting adopted the "Resolution on Colonialism," "Declaration on Threats to Civil Liberties," "Resolution on Laos," "Resolution on the Issue of Tibet in China," "Resolution on Disarmament," "Resolution on Manolis Glezos," "Resolution on Helou," "Statement on the Khrushchev-Eisenhower Talks," and "Resolution on Japan."

The "Statement on the Khrushchev-Eisenhower Talks" issued by the meeting stated that the talks and their results played a positive role in eliminating the Cold War and restoring international law regarding the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations. The "Resolution on Colonialism" pointed out that the colonial countries are currently striving to maintain and even develop the colonial system using their economic, military, and political weapons. Their actions seriously undermine the right of all peoples to enjoy independent national lives and create obstacles to promoting world peace and cooperation. The "Resolution on Laos" expressed concern about the situation in Laos and called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to take the necessary steps to "withdraw the 'United Nations Investigation Committee,'" while also requesting the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and members of the Lao Joint Committee and the International Supervisory and Control Commission to handle the Lao issue immediately in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreement in order to restore peace in Laos and eliminate existing tensions. The "Resolution on Disarmament" welcomed the new Soviet proposal on complete disarmament put forward by Khrushchev to the United Nations. It believes that the realization of this proposal will guarantee lasting world peace and usher in a new era in human history. The "Resolution on Japan" welcomed and supported the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, including the Japanese legal community, against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and against the establishment of military bases in Japan. The "Declaration on Threats to Civil Liberties" analyzed the increasingly serious situation of infringing upon civil liberties, especially infringing upon freedom of speech, assembly, association, and personal freedom, in certain countries, and called on legal workers around the world to pay attention to this continuing serious situation and asked them to cooperate in taking all effective measures to protect and reaffirm those individual and collective rights that conform to modern international law. The "Resolution on Manolis Glezos" and the "Resolution on Helou" called on all upright legal workers in the world to rescue the Greek national hero Glezos and the Lebanese people's fighter Helou, who are being illegally persecuted, in order to safeguard democratic freedom and guarantee basic human rights.

After the meeting, the representatives of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers visited various parts of our country.
