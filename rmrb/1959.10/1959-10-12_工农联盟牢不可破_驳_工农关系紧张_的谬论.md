　　The worker-peasant alliance is unbreakable
　　——Refuting the fallacy of "tense worker-peasant relations"
　　Sha Ying

    Our country is a proletarian dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. According to Lenin, the alliance between the working class and the working peasants is a special alliance and the highest principle of the proletarian dictatorship. Especially in our country, which is a large country with more than 500 million peasants, the attitude of the peasants is extremely important to the fate of our country. Domestic issues are essentially peasant issues. Therefore, it is extremely important to correctly establish the relationship between the two classes and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached great importance to this issue. If the working class does not maintain a good relationship with the peasants, its most reliable ally, and does not obtain the support of the peasants, the socialist revolution and socialist construction cannot succeed. Whoever does not understand this issue will make extremely serious political mistakes. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The extreme importance of the peasant ally is the same in the revolutionary period as it is in the construction period. At any time, political errors are always related to this issue."

    Because the worker-peasant relationship is so important, domestic and foreign reactionaries are always planning to make a big deal out of it, attempting to provoke relations between workers and peasants, undermine the worker-peasant alliance, and thereby shake the foundation of our socialist country. For example, in the early stages of the rectification movement, bourgeois rightists made a lot of fallacies about the lives of workers and peasants, clamoring that "the peasants' lives are too bitter," "the peasants' lives are on the verge of starvation," and "the lives of workers and peasants are too different!" And so on. It was as if they were very concerned about the lives of the peasants and represented the interests of the peasants. Later, after a great debate, they were exposed in their true colors before the people and were completely isolated. Their conspiracy to provoke relations between workers and peasants completely went bankrupt, and our worker-peasant alliance was further consolidated and developed on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle.

    Now, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists, influenced by the bourgeoisie and representing the interests of the bourgeoisie, have launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the people's socialist cause. Naturally, they have not let go of such an extremely important issue. So they spoke up: "Imbalances have caused tensions in all areas," "The development of this situation has affected the relationship between workers and peasants...and is therefore political." In addition, they said a lot of sensational and slanderous things that were "serious," "dangerous," "great losses," and "destroyed the worker-peasant alliance," a whole bunch of bad words that smeared the workers, the peasants, and our Party. According to their point of view, the current worker-peasant relations in our country are "extremely tense," the domestic situation is "pitch black," and the proletarian dictatorship is in a "state of crisis." As for the reasons for the non-existent situation they described, they attributed it to the Great Leap Forward of the people across the country and the people's communes of hundreds of millions of peasants. This is actually opposing our Party's general line for building socialism.

    Is the real situation like this? Are worker-peasant relations really so tense?

    Indeed, as Premier Zhou said in his "Report on Adjusting the Main Targets of the 1959 National Economic Plan and Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement," in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, due to our lack of experience in the Great Leap Forward, some shortcomings and errors did occur, causing certain imbalances in individual links of the national economy, and making the supply of a small portion of non-staple foods and a small number of daily necessities in cities relatively tight. In the early stages of the people's commune movement, due to a lack of experience, there were indeed some phenomena of excessive concentration of management power, some egalitarianism in distribution, and some waste. These shortcomings and errors were produced in the course of great development, were local and temporary, were difficult to avoid in mass movements, and have now been rapidly corrected and are being rapidly corrected. However, this is by no means what the right-leaning opportunists said, that it has caused worker-peasant relations to become "extremely tense" and "terrible." Obviously, this is their deliberate distortion of the facts, exaggerating some of the shortcomings and errors in our work, treating the local as the main body, describing the tributary as the mainstream, pouring cold water on the masses and cadres, spreading feelings of slackening, discouragement, complaining, and pessimism, attempting to create ideological and political confusion.

    The right-leaning opportunists seize on the temporary phenomenon of imbalance in individual links, attacking our Party for not respecting economic laws, not understanding comprehensive balance, and "destroying the worker-peasant alliance." However, as early as three years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "Ten Major Relationships," several of which talked about the issue of proportional development. Later, in his work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out the basic contradictions in socialist society and important guidelines such as "overall planning and comprehensive consideration" and "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture." In particular, in 1958, our Party put forward the general line for building socialism and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, including the five "simultaneous developments," all of which were formulated based on objective economic laws and were comprehensive balances of strategic significance. In the above-mentioned documents, the relationship between industry and agriculture was prominently pointed out, believing that this was the fundamental issue in building socialism under the conditions in our country. The so-called worker-peasant relationship, in the final analysis, depends on the interrelationship between industry and agriculture. Stipulating an appropriate proportional relationship between the development speed of industry and agriculture is a necessary prerequisite for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. If we want to make the worker-peasant relationship develop healthily, we must first ensure that industry and agriculture have a correct proportional relationship, prevent and overcome the decoupling phenomenon between the two, and closely integrate them, support each other, and help each other. The facts of the ten years since the founding of the country prove that we have not only made great progress in industry, but also made corresponding great progress in agriculture. In 1958, although there were imbalances in individual links, the main proportional relationships in the national economy were coordinated and correct. For example, the total industrial output value increased by 66% compared to 1957, and the total agricultural output value increased by 25% compared to 1957. The growth rate of both was unprecedented; the proportional relationship of both was coordinated and normal. The economic situation in the first half of 1959 was good, and the imbalance in individual links has been gradually overcome. At the same time, we can foresee that under the guidance of the Party's general line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, it can be guaranteed that the industry and agriculture and the entire national economy of our country will continue to advance at a high speed in the future, and it can be guaranteed that our worker-peasant alliance will continue to consolidate and develop. However, the right-leaning opportunists just can't see this overall situation and bright future, and are alarmed and speak nonsense about the illusions they subjectively create, which is really absurd.

    Lenin pointed out that after the working class seizes power, it must do its utmost to develop socialist industry so that industry can re-equip agriculture and transfer agriculture to a new technological foundation; it must establish economic cooperation between urban and rural areas and between industry and agriculture through commodity circulation. Everyone knows that if we want to develop agriculture and realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, we first need steel. Only with steel can we manufacture new-style agricultural tools and agricultural machinery to support the technological transformation of agriculture. The mass movement of great steelmaking last year enabled us not only to win the high speed of steel development, increasing the production of a large amount of steel, but also to drive the leap-forward development of the entire industrial production and capital construction "with steel as the key link." Because steel is the foundation of industry, only with the high-speed development of the steel industry can there be the high-speed development of the entire industry and the entire national economy, so that our industry has the strength to support agriculture. Facts have proved that the indigenous iron and indigenous steel produced in the Great Leap Forward movement last year played a great role in this year's agricultural production. Many simple machines and agricultural tools used in rural areas were made of indigenous iron and indigenous steel. Without this batch of indigenous iron and indigenous steel, relying solely on foreign steel would not have been able to meet the needs of agricultural production development. It is precisely because our steel industry has developed and promoted the development of the entire industry, the support of industry to agriculture has greatly increased. For example, according to the statistics of the five suburban districts of Beijing, Chaoyang, Fengtai, Haidian, Mentougou, and Changping, the total value of agricultural production materials supplied by the state to these suburban districts in 1952 was 990,000 yuan, while in 1958 it was 20,990,000 yuan, an increase of 20.2 times. In 1958, the main production materials that the people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing received from the city's industrial support included 3,250 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery (a total of 39,334 horsepower), 14,544 new-style agricultural tools, 29.71 million jin of chemical fertilizers, 7,565 sets of pesticide machinery, and 4.59 million jin of pesticides, which basically met the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing in 1958 and played a great role in production. For example, in order to support the leap forward of agriculture in various places, Shanghai's industrial departments manufactured nearly 120,000 horsepower of power machinery such as diesel engines and locomotive boilers, more than 3,300 agricultural water pumps, more than 2,000 tons of agricultural agents, more than 8,400 tons of chemical fertilizers, and a large number of cultivation machinery and pesticide spraying machinery in the first half of this year. The power machinery and water pumps can be used for irrigation and drainage of more than 10 million mu of farmland. If we look forward to the future, as long as we adhere to the mass movement of vigorously developing steel and the "walking on two legs" policy, it will inevitably lead to the high-speed development of our industry and accelerate the pace of our agricultural mechanization. Isn't this very clear? However, the right-leaning opportunists are short-sighted and have a limited understanding, do not understand the role of the mass movement of great steelmaking in agricultural development, and cannot see its promotion of worker-peasant relations.

    Due to the establishment, consolidation, and sound development of the people's communes, which have greater superiority than advanced agricultural production cooperatives, promoting the great development of agricultural production and diversified operations, this is of great significance for agriculture to support industry and guarantee the supply of cities, and promote the development of worker-peasant relations and urban-rural relations. In 1958, the total grain output in our country reached 500 billion jin, an increase of 35% compared to 1957; the total cotton output reached 42 million dan, an increase of 28% compared to 1957. In addition to the total agricultural output value increasing by 25% compared to 1957, the forestry output value increased by 193.2%, the total fishery output value (referring to the artificial breeding part) increased by 128%, the animal husbandry output value increased by 5.2%, and the sideline output value also maintained the level of 1957. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the commodity circulation volume has also developed by leaps and bounds. In 1958, the total value of agricultural and sideline products sold in rural areas reached 22 billion yuan, exceeding any year in history, and compared with the small-scale peasant economy of 1952 before cooperation, it almost more than doubled, and compared with 1956 when advanced production cooperatives were realized, it also increased by 27.6%. In the first half of this year, the total value of agricultural and sideline products sold by communes and peasants increased by 1.4 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. This shows that the people's communes have provided more agricultural products to the cities, and the economic ties between urban and rural areas have been further developed.

    After the people's communes, with the development of agricultural production, the expansion of commodity circulation, and the increase in peasants' monetary income, the lives of the peasants have also improved significantly. In 1958, the income level and living standards of each peasant increased by about 10% compared to 1957. To improve so much in one year is also unprecedented. After the purchasing power and self-sufficiency consumption of peasants increased, some non-staple foods supplied to cities relatively decreased, such as if the peasants eat one jin two liang more meat per person, the urban residents will eat six jin less per person. However, the lives of peasants have always been very low. It is appropriate to let the hardworking peasants eat a little more and wear a little more, so that the gap between the lives of urban and rural people can be narrowed.

    Due to the mutual support of industry and agriculture, cities and villages, the economic and productive ties between the working class and the working peasants are closer, and the worker-peasant alliance is more consolidated on the basis of socialist production relations. At the same time, their political and cultural ties are also increasingly close. For decades, the workers and peasants of our country, in the flames of long-term revolutionary struggles, under the leadership of the party of the working class, have been interdependent and fought side by side, and finally achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the peasants have obtained land and freedom. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the working class has continued to help the peasants, overcome their spontaneous capitalist tendencies, and led them on the road of socialism through the agricultural cooperation movement, and they have made significant contributions to the cause of socialist construction. In the nationwide rectification movement and the struggle against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, a fierce struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology was launched, and the peasants were once again given a huge socialist education, greatly raising their political consciousness, and making their determination and confidence in taking the socialist road more firm. Especially after the Party put forward the general line of socialist construction, through the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, due to the strengthening of the Party's political and ideological education, due to the joint labor, mutual assistance and cooperation, mutual visits, and visits between workers and peasants under new conditions, the friendship between workers and peasants and political ties have developed even more. On the basis of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, cultural and educational undertakings in urban and rural areas have also greatly developed. In the past year or so, a massive literacy campaign has been launched throughout the country, with literacy work carried out among approximately 60 million people, exceeding the total number of literacy campaigns in the past eight years. Many cities and counties across the country have basically universalized primary education, and the enrollment rate of school-age children across the country has reached more than 85%. Tens of thousands of spare-time primary schools, spare-time middle schools, red and expert schools, and cultural and technical schools have been established in the vast rural areas, and public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, health centers, cultural centers, clubs, amateur theatrical troupes, etc. have been universally established. This shows that the cultural ties between workers and peasants have also been strengthened.

    All these facts are invisible to the right-leaning opportunists. They do not understand the real situation between workers and peasants at all. They underestimate the awareness of the worker-peasant masses in our country. They cannot feel the deep feelings of the people of our country for the Party and for the motherland. They are blinded by some local and temporary shortcomings and obsessed with their minds. This is because they are too deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology and are seriously divorced from the masses.

    Of course, the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas still exist. Whether in terms of production technology, science, culture, etc., cities are more developed than rural areas; in terms of living standards and living conditions, there are also certain differences between urban and rural people; especially in terms of ownership, the people's communes in rural areas are still collectively owned, while in cities, the main form of ownership is ownership by the whole people, and ownership by the whole people is more advanced than collective ownership. However, everyone knows that these differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas are the result of the old division of labor and class opposition in human history, and cannot be eliminated for a while. Our task is to seek appropriate ways and methods, continuously develop social productive forces, make products increasingly abundant, gradually narrow this gap, and create conditions so that this gap can be eliminated in the future. And now we have begun to find these ways and methods, which should be said to be a very important issue. The facts of the past year prove that the people's communes not only guarantee the universal improvement of the output per unit area of agricultural units, but also exerted great efforts in afforestation, road construction, large-scale water conservancy, large-scale steelmaking, and overcoming natural disasters. It has undergone severe tests. At the same time, we must also see that due to the consolidation and sound development of the people's communes, the accumulation fund and public welfare fund controlled by the communes will continue to increase (the communes can extract accumulation from the production teams every year), the commune-run industry and commune-run undertakings will continue to develop (the profits of commune enterprises will also continue to increase the accumulation), coupled with the state's investment and assistance, this can not only realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture faster, but also make the commune ownership develop quickly. Take the commune-run industry as an example, according to the statistics of 17 provinces across the country, in 1958, the people's communes built approximately 9,000 cement plants, producing more than 290,000 tons of cement; more than 500,000 fertilizer plants, producing more than 50 million tons of indigenous fertilizer; nearly 80,000 agricultural tool manufacturing and repair plants, producing and repairing 100 million agricultural tools; and more than 600,000 steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces, producing more than 2.4 million tons of indigenous iron and 530,000 tons of indigenous steel. According to the latest statistics, the total industrial output value of the people's communes across the country has increased by approximately two times compared to the same period last year, accounting for approximately 10% of the total industrial output value of the country. In 1958, the accumulation of the people's communes reached 10.1 billion yuan, more than doubling the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in 1957. The increased accumulation of the communes this year greatly exceeded the scale and growth rate during the past few years of agricultural cooperatives. Due to the great increase in commune accumulation, the number of machinery and new-style agricultural tools in rural areas has greatly increased. Compared with the end of 1957, at the end of 1958, the power of the communes' irrigation and drainage machinery increased from 570,000 horsepower to 1.6 million horsepower, the power of hydroelectric generating equipment increased from 20,000 kilowatts to 150,000 kilowatts, the number of tractors increased from 26,000 standard units to 45,000 standard units, the number of combine harvesters increased from more than 1,600 units to more than 3,500 units, and the number of double-wheel double-furrow plows increased from 1.64 million units to 2.14 million units. Everyone knows that since commune ownership already contains certain elements of ownership by the whole people, with the development of production and the gradual expansion of commune ownership, the elements of ownership by the whole people will also gradually increase. If we look further ahead, with the development of agricultural mechanization and the gradual increase of the elements of ownership by the whole people, with the increasing improvement of the living standards and cultural level of the rural people, industry and agriculture, cities and villages will inevitably be more closely integrated, which will open up the way for gradually narrowing the gap between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, and even gradually create conditions for the disappearance of these gaps in the future. That is to say, under the conditions in our country, the people's commune is the best social organizational form for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and it is also the best social organizational form for the future transition from socialism to communism. Marx and Engels put forward the brilliant ideal of "combining agriculture with industry and gradually eliminating the antagonism between town and country" as early as in the "Communist Manifesto," and Lenin also made a great prediction about this in the article "A Great Beginning." However, as for how to realize this ideal, now our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have found the specific path and form of the people's commune, which is a great creation that combines Marxist theory with our country's practical experience and has epoch-making significance. This is even more incomprehensible to the stubborn minds of the right-leaning opportunists!

    In summary, under the guidance of the Party's general line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, due to the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, the cooperation and mutual assistance between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas have developed. Not only has the worker-peasant alliance been further consolidated, but also the great unity of the people across the country has been further developed. Since our Party implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, schools run factories and farms, factories and communes run schools, schools and factories and farms are mutually linked, moving towards the direction of intellectualizing workers and peasants, and workerizing and peasantizing intellectuals; and implemented the policy of cadres going down to participate in physical labor, officers becoming soldiers, factory directors becoming workers, commune cadres becoming commune members, implementing "two participations and three combinations" in factories, and implementing democratic management in communes, etc., in this way, the relations between urban and rural workers, students, intellectuals, and worker-peasant laborers are closer, and the relations between cadres and the masses and between the army and the residents are more improved. Except for a small number of people such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the vast majority of the people in our country are united in heart and mind, and the Party's general line and the policies, guidelines, and working methods that embody the general line have been welcomed by the vast number of Party members, cadres, and the masses of the people. From this, it can be seen that the right-leaning opportunists' fallacy about the "tense" relationship between workers and peasants and between all strata is completely rumor-mongering, slandering, inverting black and white, and provoking discord, and its purpose is to shake people's hearts and disintegrate morale! If their conspiracy succeeds, it can only deflate the morale of cadres and the masses, cause division in the revolutionary ranks, and cause a major "saddle shape" in the cause of socialist construction. Of course, in the face of the great unity of our entire Party and the great unity of the people across the country, their conspiracy will not succeed, and will only end up with their heads broken and bleeding!

　　工农联盟牢不可破
　　——驳“工农关系紧张”的谬论
　　沙英
    我国是一个在工人阶级领导下的、以工农联盟为基础的无产阶级专政的国家。按照列宁的说法，工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，是无产阶级专政的特式联盟和最高原则。特别是我国是有五亿多农民的大国，农民的态度如何，对于我国的命运关系极大。所谓国内问题，实质上是农民问题。因此，正确地建立两个阶级之间的关系，巩固工农联盟，是极端重要的问题。我们党和毛泽东同志从来都是非常重视这个问题的。工人阶级要是不把同农民这个最可靠的同盟军的关系搞好，得不到农民的支持，社会主义革命和社会主义建设是不能成功的。谁要是不懂得这个问题，谁就要在政治上犯极大的错误。刘少奇同志在党的八大第二次会议的工作报告中说：“农民同盟军问题的极端重要性，革命时期是这样，建设时期仍然是这样。无论在什么时候，政治上犯错误，总是同这个问题相关联的。”
    正因为工农关系如此之重要，所以国内外的反动派总经常打算在这方面大做文章，妄图挑拨工农之间的关系，破坏工农联盟，从而动摇我们社会主义国家的基础。例如在整风运动初期，资产阶级右派分子曾经在工农生活方面大发谬论，口口声声说“农民生活太苦了”，“农民生活已濒于饥饿的边缘”，“工农生活相差太大了”！如此等等。好像他们是很关心农民生活和代表农民利益的。以后，经过一场大辩论，他们在人民面前原形毕露，彻底地被孤立起来，那种挑拨工农关系的阴谋诡计完全破产了，我们的工农联盟在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上进一步获得了巩固和发展。
    现在，一小撮右倾机会主义分子受资产阶级的影响，代表资产阶级的利益，向党向人民的社会主义事业发动了猖狂的进攻，自然他们也没有放过这样一个极端重要的问题。于是他们说话了：“由于比例失调而引起各方面的紧张”，“这种情况的发展已影响到工农之间……的关系，因此也是具有政治性的。”此外，他们还说了许多“严重”、“危险”、“损失很大”、“破坏了工农联盟”等等耸人听闻的、污蔑工人农民和我们党的一大堆坏话。按照他们的观点看来，我国现时的工农关系是“紧张的不得了”，国内形势是“漆黑一团”，无产阶级专政是处于“危机之中”。至于产生如他们所说的这种莫须有的状况的原因，他们则归罪于全国人民的大跃进和几亿农民的人民公社化。这实际上是反对我们党的建设社会主义的总路线。
    真实的情况是这样的吗？工农关系是如此之紧张吗？
    诚然，正如周总理在“关于调整1959年国民经济计划主要指标和进一步开展增产节约运动的报告”中所说的，在大跃进的高潮中，由于我们缺乏大跃进的经验，曾经发生过一些缺点和错误，使国民经济在个别环节上出现了某些失调现象，使城市一小部分副食品和少数日用品的供应比较紧张。在人民公社化运动的初期，也同样是由于缺乏经验，的确曾经出现过某些管理权集中过多、分配上某些平均主义和某些浪费的现象。这些缺点和错误是大发展中产生的，是局部的和暂时性的，是在群众运动中难以避免的，而且现在已经迅速地纠正了和正在迅速地纠正着。但是，这绝不是像右倾机会主义分子所说的，已引起了工农关系紧张的“不得了”，“糟得很”，显然，这是他们故意歪曲事实，夸大了我们工作中的某些缺点和错误，把局部当作主体，把支流说成主流，向群众和干部大泼冷水，散布松劲、泄气、埋怨和悲观的情绪，企图制造思想上和政治上的混乱。
    右倾机会主义分子抓着一时的、个别环节上的比例失调现象，攻击我们党不尊重经济规律，不懂得综合平衡，“破坏了工农联盟”。可是，远在三年之前，毛泽东同志曾作过关于“十大关系”的报告，其中有好几条都是讲的有关按比例发展的问题。以后毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的著作中，也曾指出了社会主义社会中的基本矛盾和“统筹兼顾，适当安排”、工农业并举等重要的方针问题。特别在1958年我们党提出了建设社会主义的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，其中规定的五个“并举”，都是根据客观的经济规律而制定的，带有战略意义的综合平衡。在以上这些文件中，都突出地指出了工业和农业的关系问题，认为这是在我国条件下建设社会主义的根本问题。所谓工农关系，归根到底，是依赖于工业和农业的相互关系。规定工业和农业发展速度之间的适当比例关系，是进一步巩固工农联盟的必要前提。我们要使工农关系得到健康的发展，首先就要使工业和农业有正确的比例关系，防止和克服两者的脱节现象，使两者密切结合起来，互相支援，互相帮助。建国十年来的事实证明，我们不仅在工业方面有了很大的发展，同时在农业方面也相应地有了很大的发展。1958年，虽然发生过个别环节上的比例失调现象，但是国民经济中主要的比例关系是协调的正确的。例如，工业总产值比1957年增长了66％，农业的总产值比1957年增长了25％。两者增长的速度，是史无前例的；两者的比例关系，是协调的正常的。1959年上半年的经济情况是良好的，个别环节上的失调现象已逐步克服。同时，我们可以预见，在党的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针的指导下，可以保证我国的工农业和整个国民经济在今后继续高速度地前进，可以保证我们的工农联盟继续巩固地发展。可是，右倾机会主义分子偏偏看不到这种整个的形势和光明的前途，而为自己主观所制造的幻象大惊小怪，胡言乱语，实在是非常荒谬的。
    列宁指出，在工人阶级夺取了政权以后，必须竭尽全力发展社会主义工业，使工业能够重新装备农业，把农业转到新的技术基础上去；必须通过商品流转，建立城乡间和工农业间的经济合作。谁都知道，我们要发展农业，实现农业机械化、电气化，这首先就需要钢铁，只有有了钢铁，才能制造新式农具和农业机器，支援农业的技术改革。去年大炼钢铁的群众运动，使我们不仅赢得了钢铁发展的高速度，增产了大批的钢铁，而且“以钢为纲”带动了整个工业生产和基本建设的飞跃发展。因为钢铁是工业的基础，有了钢铁工业的高速度发展，才能有整个工业和整个国民经济的高速度发展，才能使我们的工业有力量去支援农业。事实证明，去年在大炼钢铁运动中所生产的土铁、土钢，在今年的农业生产中发挥了很大的作用，许多农村用的简易机械和农具，都是用土铁、土钢制造的，没有这批土铁、土钢，仅靠洋钢，就不能供应农业生产发展的需要。正因为我们的钢铁工业发展了，并推动了整个工业的发展，所以工业对农业的支援有了很大的增长。例如，据北京市所属的朝阳、丰台、海淀、门头沟、昌平五个郊区的统计，1952年国家向这些郊区供应的农业生产资料总值是九十九万元，而1958年是二千零九十九万元，其增长倍数为二十点二。1958年北京郊区各人民公社得到城市工业支援的主要生产资料，有排灌机械三千二百五十台（共三万九千三百三十四马力），新式农具一万四千五百四十四件，化学肥料二千九百七十一万斤，药械七千五百六十五架，农药四百五十九万斤，这基本上满足了京郊1958年农业生产大跃进的需要，在生产中发挥了很大的作用。再例如上海工业部门为支援各地农业的跃进，在今年上半年为农村制造的柴油机、锅驼机等动力机械近十二万马力，农业水泵三千三百多台，农业药剂二千多吨，化学肥料八千四百多吨，还有大批耕耘机械和喷射农药的机械。其中的动力机械和水泵，可供一千多万亩农田灌溉和排涝之用。如果展望将来，只要我们坚持贯彻执行大办钢铁的群众运动和“两条腿走路”的方针，必然导致我们的工业高速度地发展，必然促使我们的农业机械化加快步伐。这难道不是很明白的吗？可是，右倾机会主义分子鼠目寸光，见识短浅，不理解大炼钢铁的群众运动对于农业发展的作用，看不到它对于工农关系的促进。
    由于人民公社的建立、巩固和健全的发展，比高级农业生产合作社具有更大的优越性，促进了农业生产和多种经营的巨大发展，这使农业支援工业和保证城市的供应，促进工农关系和城乡关系的发展，都有很大的意义。1958年我国粮食总产量达到五千亿斤，比1957年增长35％；棉花的总产量达四千二百万担，比1957年增长28％。除了农业总产值较1957年增长25％以外，林业产值增长193.2％，渔业总产值（指人工养殖部分）增长128％，牧业产值增长5.2％，副业产值也保持了1957年的水平。在农业生产大跃进的基础上，商品流通量也有飞跃的发展。1958年农村出售农副业商品的总值达到二百二十亿元，超过历史上的任何一年，与合作化前的1952年的小农经济相比，几乎超过了一倍，与实现高级生产合作社的1956年相比，也增加了27.6％。今年上半年公社和农民出售的农副产品总值，又比去年同期增加了十四亿元。这是说明，人民公社为城市提供了更多的农产品，城乡之间的经济联系有了进一步的发展。
    在人民公社化以后，随着农业生产的发展，商品流通量的扩大和农民货币收入的增加，农民的生活也显著地改善了。1958年每一个农民的收入水平和生活水平，比1957年大约提高百分之十左右。一年提高这样多，还是空前未有的。当农民购买力和自给性消费提高以后，某些供应城市的副食品就相对地减少一些，如农民每人多吃一斤二两肉，城市居民每人就少吃六斤。但是农民的生活一向是很低的，让勤劳的农民多吃一点，多穿一点，使城乡人民的生活的差距缩小一些，也是应当的。
    由于工业和农业、城市和乡村的互相支援，工人阶级和劳动农民在生产上和经济上的联系更加密切了，工农联盟在社会主义生产关系的基础上更加巩固了。同时，他们在政治上和文化上的联系也日益密切了。几十年来，我国的工人和农民，在长期革命斗争的烈火中，在工人阶级的政党领导之下，相依为命，并肩作战，建立了战斗的联盟，终于取得了中国革命的胜利，农民取得了土地和自由。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，工人阶级又继续帮助农民，克服了他们的资本主义自发趋势，经过农业合作化运动，引导他们走上了社会主义的道路，他们对社会主义建设事业作出了重大的贡献。在全民整风运动和反对地、富、反、坏、右的斗争中，开展了一场社会主义思想和资本主义思想的激烈的斗争，对农民又进行了一次巨大的社会主义教育，大大提高了他们的政治觉悟，使他们走社会主义道路的决心和信心更加坚定了。特别是在党提出了社会主义建设的总路线之后，经过大跃进和人民公社化，由于党的政治思想教育的加强，由于工人和农民在新的条件下共同劳动，互助协作，互相参观、访问，使工人与农民的友谊和政治上的联系更加发展了。在工农业各项生产迅速发展的基础上，城乡的文化教育事业也有了很大的发展。一年多以来，全国各地先后掀起了声势浩大的扫盲运动，大约在六千万人口中进行了扫盲工作，超过了过去八年的扫盲总数。全国许多市、县基本上普及了小学教育，全国学龄儿童入学的达到85％以上。在广大的农村建立了数以万计的业余小学、业余中学、红专学校和文化技术学校，普遍地设立了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、卫生所、文化馆、俱乐部、业余剧团，等等。这是说明工人和农民在文化上的联系也加强了。
    所有这些事实，都是右倾机会主义分子看不见的，他们根本不理解工农之间的真实情况，他们对我国工农群众的觉悟估计过低，他们体会不到我国人民对于党、对于祖国的深厚的感情，他们是被一些局部的暂时的缺点蒙蔽了眼睛，迷住了心窍，这是因为他们受资产阶级的思想影响太深和严重地脱离群众的缘故。
    当然，现在工农差别、城乡差别还是存在的。不论在生产技术、科学文化等方面，城市都比乡村发达；就生活水平和居住条件来说，城乡人民也存在着一定的差别；特别是就所有制来说，现在农村的人民公社还是集体所有制，在城市中主要的是全民所有制，全民所有制是比集体所有制更进步的。不过，谁都知道，工农之间和城乡之间的这些差别，是人类历史上的旧式分工和阶级对立所造成的结果，是一时不能消灭的。我们的任务，是寻求适当的途径和方法，不断发展社会生产力，使产品日益丰富起来，逐渐缩小这种差别，并创造条件，以便在将来消灭这种差别。而现在我们已开始找到了这种途径和方法，这应该说是很重要的问题。一年来的事实证明，人民公社不仅保证了农业单位面积产量的普遍提高，而且在造林、修路、大搞水利、大炼钢铁和战胜自然灾害等方面，都出了大力。它已经受了严重的考验。同时我们还要看到，由于人民公社的巩固和健全的发展，由公社支配的公积金和公益金将不断增加（公社每年可由生产队提取积累），社办工业和社办事业将不断发展（公社企业的利润也不断增加积累），再加上国家的投资和帮助，这不仅可以较快地实现农业的机械化、电气化，而且会使公社所有制很快地发展起来。就以社办工业来说，根据全国十七个省的统计，1958年人民公社大约举办了水泥厂九千多个，生产水泥二十九万多吨；化肥厂五十多万个，生产了土化肥五千多万吨；农具制造厂和修理厂近八万个，生产和修理了农具一亿件；炼钢、炼铁炉六十余万个，炼出土铁二百四十多万吨，土钢五十三万吨。根据最近的统计，目前全国人民公社的工业总产值比去年同期增长了约两倍，占全国工业总产值的比重10％左右。1958年人民公社的积累达一百零一亿元，比1957年农业合作社的积累增长一倍多，这一年公社增加的积累，大大超过了过去几年农业合作社期间的规模和增长的速度。由于公社积累的大大增加，农村的机械和新式农具是大量地增加了。同1957年末比较，1958年末公社的排灌机械由五十七万马力增加到一百六十万马力，水力发电设备由二万瓩增至十五万瓩，拖拉机由二万六千标准台增加到四万五千标准台，联合收割机由一千六百多台增加到三千五百台，双轮双铧犁由一百六十四万部增加到二百一十四万部。大家都知道，由于公社所有制已经包含着某种全民所有制的成分，随着生产的发展和公社所有制的逐步扩大，全民所有制的成分也将逐步增长。如果再把眼光看远一点，随着农业机械化的发展和全民所有制成分的逐步增长，随着农村人民生活和文化水平的日益提高，势必使工业和农业、城市和乡村更加紧密地结合起来，这就为逐步缩小工农差别和城乡差别开辟了道路，甚至为将来这些差别的消失逐步创造条件。这就是说，在我国的条件下，人民公社是由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的最好的社会组织形式，而且是将来由社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好的社会组织形式。马克思和恩格斯早在“共产党宣言”中提出了“将农业同工业结合起来，促使城乡对立状态逐渐消灭”的光辉的理想，列宁也在“伟大的创举”一文中对此作过伟大的预言，但是，如何实现这种理想，现在我们党中央和毛泽东同志找到了人民公社这个具体的途径和形式，这是把马克思主义理论结合我国实际经验的伟大创造，具有划时代的意义。这更是右倾机会主义分子的顽固脑袋所无法理解的！
    总起来说，在党的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针指导之下，由于大跃进，由于人民公社化，发展了工农之间和城乡之间的协作互助，不仅工农联盟是更加巩固了，而且全国人民的大团结也有了进一步的发展。由于我们党实行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，学校办工厂、办农场，工厂、公社办学校，学校与工厂、农场互相挂钩，向知识分子工农化、工农知识化的方向前进；并且实行了干部下放参加体力劳动，军官当兵，厂长当工人，公社干部当社员，在工厂中实行“两参、三结合”，在公社中实行管理民主化，等等，这样一来，城乡中的职工、学生、知识分子和工农劳动人民的关系更加密切了，干部和群众、军队和居民的关系更加改善了。除了地、富、反、坏、右等少部分人以外，我国绝大多数的人民是同德同心，团结一致的，党的总路线和体现总路线的方针、政策、工作方法，受到了广大党员广大干部和广大人民群众的欢迎。由此可见，右倾机会主义分子关于工农关系和各阶层关系“紧张”的谬论，完全是造谣诬蔑，颠倒黑白，挑拨是非，其目的是为了动摇人心，瓦解斗志！如果他们的阴谋得逞，只能泄干部和群众的气，引起革命队伍的分裂，使社会主义建设事业出现大的“马鞍形”。当然，在我们全党大团结和全国人民大团结的面前，他们的阴谋是不会得逞的，只能碰得头破血流而已！
