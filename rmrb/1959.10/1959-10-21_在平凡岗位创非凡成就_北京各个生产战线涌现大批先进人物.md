Creating Extraordinary Achievements in Ordinary Positions
    A Large Number of Advanced Individuals Emerge on Various Production Fronts in Beijing

    (Our report) Amidst the upsurge of the vigorous increase production and practice economy movement, a large number of advanced production units and advanced producers have emerged in Beijing's industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts. Their common characteristics are: adhering to the Party's general line for socialist construction, daring to think and act, studying diligently, striving for progress, and doing everything possible to make production new every month and new every day. In production and work, they serve the people with utter devotion and diligence, creating extraordinary achievements in ordinary positions.

    The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, an advanced collective, mobilized workers to participate in management and established a complete set of advanced enterprise management methods on the basis of vigorously developing mass movements. At the same time, they carried out vigorous technical innovation, continuously improving labor productivity. From 1956 to the present, they have consistently overfulfilled the state plan on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, and have maintained a monthly increase in output and output value, with continuous improvement in product quality. In the first nine months of this year, their output increased more than twofold compared with the same period last year, and their output value increased more than four and a half times compared with the same period last year. In the first half of October, the entire factory broke quotas every day, completing 75.8% of the monthly plan in terms of output value. Advanced producers are constantly emerging throughout the factory, and more than 300 employees have now entered 1960 ahead of schedule. The steel reinforcement team of Zhang Baifa of the Third Construction Company has been continuously learning to be versatile and innovating technically since its establishment in 1954. They over fulfill the basic construction plan every month while ensuring quality. In October, to present a gift to the meeting of heroes, all team members launched a technical competition. On the first day of production after the National Day holiday, team member Chu Zhentang won the championship by bending 1,838 stirrups. The next day, Han Zhenxue caught up and bent 2,037, surpassing Chu Zhentang. As a result of vigorous technical competitions, the entire team completed the monthly task by the 15th. All qualities reached first class standards. The Tianqiao Department Store, after being named a red flag unit on the national commercial front during the Great Leap Forward last year, continued to leap forward without stopping. By the end of September this year, 85% of the salespersons in the entire store could serve customers according to the requirements of the five-item service standards. Now, they propose to continue in-depth study to improve the quality of service, and by the end of the year, all salespersons will be able to serve customers according to the five-item service standards. The technical level of seventeen salespersons in seven items such as cloth measurement and bundling has reached the highest record created during the first technical performance of financial and trade employees in the city.

    Daring to innovate and create, and trying every means to implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, this excellent quality is very prominent in advanced producers. Chen Fa, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, has demonstrated soaring enthusiasm since liberation, and has worked with workers to solve and overcome countless major technical keys in locomotive repair and manufacturing. For example, the overheating of the main axle after the Friendship-type locomotive was converted to a different track gauge was a difficult technical problem encountered in the factory's production. Chen Fa worked hard day and night, and put forward three suggestions, finally breaking through this key, shortening the time the locomotive spent in the factory from fourteen days to four days, making a contribution to meeting transportation needs. Gu Yanming, Secretary of the Party General Branch and Director of the Taipingzhuang Brick and Tile Factory in Beijing, led employees in five months of hard work to create a double-cylinder rotary kiln that dries and bakes at the same time. This type of rotary kiln uses waste heat instead of natural drying, ending the history of brick and tile kilns "relying on the weather" for thousands of years, turning seasonal brick and tile kilns into factories that produce all year round, increasing output by more than 50%. The daily output per cubic meter of the rotary kiln has reached the national first-class level.

    These advanced producers have a high sense of responsibility for the cause of socialism, and many people have worked diligently and selflessly for the past ten years. Li Jiude, a coal miner at the Chengzi Coal Mine, has never missed a shift in the past ten years. His home is twelve miles away from the mine. Regardless of winter or summer, no matter how strong the wind or rain, he is always early to work and late to leave. Under his influence, his team has already achieved monthly overproduction. Dai Fengchen, the foreman of the sand casting workshop at the Changxindian Communications Factory, has never produced defective products or had personal or mechanical accidents in the past ten years, except for one time when the weather was extremely cold (minus twenty-six degrees), and the factory building did not have heating equipment, causing the sand molds to freeze and scrapping a dozen electric bells. In the seven years since 1953, he has never missed a shift.

    These advanced producers, who have emerged from the masses, inspire and drive the surrounding employees with their advanced ideas and advanced deeds, promoting a socialist labor competition upsurge in various units to learn from and catch up with the advanced, so that new advanced producers continue to emerge and production levels continue to improve.

    在平凡岗位创非凡成就
    北京各个生产战线涌现大批先进人物
    本报讯　在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动高潮中，北京市工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上，涌现出大批先进生产单位和先进生产者。他们共同的特点是：坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，敢想敢干，顽强学习，力争上游，千方百计地使生产月月新、日日新。在生产和工作中，他们忠心耿耿、勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，在平凡的岗位上创造了非凡的成绩。
    先进集体北京电子管厂，发动工人参加管理，在大搞群众运动的基础上，建立了整套先进的企业管理方法，同时大闹技术革新，不断提高劳动生产率，从1956年到现在，始终按月、按季、按年地超额完成国家计划，并且保持了产量、产值月月增长，产品质量不断上升。今年头九个月，他们完成的产量比去年同期增长了一倍多，产值比去年同期增长了四倍半以上；10月上半月，全厂又天天突破定额，产值完成月计划的75.8％。全厂先进生产者不断涌现，现在已有三百余名职工跨进了1960年。第三建筑公司钢筋工张百发青年突击队，1954年建队以来，由于队员不断学习多面手和革新技术，在保证质量的前提下，月月超额完成基本建设计划。10月份为了向群英会献礼，全体队员又展开了技术比武竞赛。国庆节后开始生产第一天，队员褚振堂弯套篐一千八百三十八个获得了冠军；第二天，韩振学猛赶直追，弯了二千零三十七个，超过了褚振堂。大搞技术比武的结果，全队到15日就完成了全月任务。质量全部达到了一级品。天桥百货商场去年大跃进中被评为全国商业战线的红旗以后，马不停蹄地继续跃进。到今年9月底，全商场已有85％的售货员可以按五项服务标准的要求接待顾客。现在，他们提出要继续深入学习，提高服务质量，到年底作到全体售货员都能按照五项服务标准接待顾客，有十七个售货员的量布、捆扎等七个项目的技术水平，赶上全市财贸职工第一次技术表演时创造的最高纪录。
    勇于革新创造，想尽一切办法贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，这一优良品质在先进生产者身上表现得十分突出。长辛店机车车辆工厂“二七”老工人陈发，解放以来发挥了冲天的干劲，和工人们一道解决和攻破了机车修理和制造中的无数重大技术关键。例如，友好型机车改轨后大轴发热，是这个厂生产中遇到的一个技术疑难问题。陈发昼夜苦心钻研，提出了三条建议，终于突破了这一关键，使机车在厂时间由十四天缩短到四天，对满足运输需要作出了贡献。北京市太平庄砖瓦厂党总支书记兼厂长顾延明带领职工苦战五月，创造了干燥与焙烧同时进行的双筒轮窑。这种轮窑利用废热代替自然干燥，结束了几千年来砖瓦窑“靠天吃饭”的历史，把季节性生产的砖瓦窑变成了常年生产的工厂，提高产量50％以上，轮窑每立方米日产量达到了全国第一流水平。
    这些先进生产者对社会主义事业抱有高度责任感，许多人勤勤恳恳、忘我劳动的精神十年如一日。城子煤矿采煤工人李九德十年以来，从没缺过一次勤。他的家离矿井有十二里地，不论冬夏，不管多大的风雨，他每天都是早上班，晚下班。在他的影响下，他所在的小组已经达到月月超产。长辛店通讯工厂翻砂工长戴风臣，十年来除了一次因为天气严寒（零下二十六度），厂房没有保暖设备，将砂型冻结，报废了十几个电铃以外，从来没有出过废品和人身、机械事故；从1953年以来的七年当中，他从来没有缺过一次勤。
    这些从群众中产生出来的先进生产者，以他们的先进思想和先进事迹鼓舞和带动着周围的职工，促进了各单位学先进、赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛热潮，使新的先进生产者不断出现，生产水平不断提高。
