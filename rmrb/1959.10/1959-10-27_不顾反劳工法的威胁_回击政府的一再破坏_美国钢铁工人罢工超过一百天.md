Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: Despite facing the serious threat of the U.S. government's declared invocation of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to immediately halt the strike, half a million U.S. steelworkers are currently persisting in their strike.

U.S. President Eisenhower, in order to protect the interests of monopoly capital, announced on the 9th of this month his decision to invoke the reactionary Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to end the strike. He first pretended to appoint a three-person "investigation" committee to conduct a "final mediation" between labor and management. In this "mediation," the large steel industry capitalists, relying on their strength, stubbornly rejected the union's demands for wage increases and improved benefits, even though the union had already reduced these demands. Labor-management negotiations therefore broke down again. Following this, Eisenhower instructed the Justice Department on the 19th to petition the court to issue an order quickly forcing workers to return to work. To deceive public opinion, Eisenhower himself issued a statement at a press conference held on the 22nd, talking at length about how the steelworkers' strike had "endangered the health and safety of the nation." Using the excuse that the strike had affected American "missile production" and caused unemployment among workers in other industries, he hypocritically said that although the Taft-Hartley Act "is not necessarily a good or adequate law," he had "no other choice" but to invoke this law. He completely failed to mention why he did not advise or urge the capitalists to accept the workers' reasonable demands.

On the 21st, the Pittsburgh District Court, the center of the U.S. steel industry, issued an order forcing striking workers to return to work for eighty days under the Taft-Hartley Act. However, the union fought through legal procedures. It immediately appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. In this situation, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals had to announce a temporary suspension of the court order until the Court of Appeals had heard the appeal. It is generally expected that the Court of Appeals will quickly reject the union's appeal.

David McDonald, president of the United Steelworkers of America, issued a statement on the 19th condemning the Eisenhower administration's policy of serving monopoly capital. He said, "The power of the government is being used to obtain something that the wealthy and powerful steel industry could never obtain. That is, to force steelworkers to return to work without getting the fair and reasonable settlement they are entitled to." (U.S.) International Electrical Workers Union President Carey pointed out on the 21st that this once again proves that Eisenhower is clearly "standing with" the big monopoly groups "and is sworn to their 'profits above all' philosophy." The steel strike has now exceeded one hundred days and is the longest steel strike in the United States since the war. (Attached picture)

### 不顾反劳工法的威胁　回击政府的一再破坏  美国钢铁工人罢工超过一百天

    不顾反劳工法的威胁　回击政府的一再破坏
    美国钢铁工人罢工超过一百天
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：尽管面临着美国政府已经宣布引用塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法立即制止罢工的严重威胁，美国五十万钢铁工人目前仍然在坚持罢工。
    维护垄断资本利益的美国总统艾森豪威尔在本月9日宣布决定援引反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法以制止罢工以后，首先装模作样地任命了一个三人“调查”委员会来对劳资双方作“最后一次调解”。在这场“调解”中，有恃无恐的大钢铁工业资本家蛮横地拒绝了工会方面的提高工资和改善福利的要求，虽然工会已经降低了这种要求。劳资谈判因而再度决裂。在这以后，艾森豪威尔在19日指示司法部向法院提出要求，要它迅速发出命令强迫工人复工。为了蒙蔽舆论，艾森豪威尔本人又在22日举行的记者招待会上发表声明，大谈钢铁工人罢工已经“危及国家的健康和安全”。他以罢工已经影响美国的“导弹生产”和引起其他行业工人失业为借口，假惺惺地说虽然塔夫脱—哈特莱法“并不一定是良好的或充分的法律”，但是他除了引用这一法律以外“别无他法”。他完全不谈他为什么不劝告或促使资方接受工人的合理要求。
    21日美国钢铁工业中心匹兹堡区法院发布命令，强迫罢工工人根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法复工八十天。但是工会通过法律程序进行了斗争。它立即向美国上诉法院提出上诉。在这种情况下，美国第三上诉法院不得不宣布暂缓执行法院的命令，直到上诉法院听完上诉为止。一般预料，上诉法院将迅速驳回工会的上诉。
    美国钢铁工人联合会主席麦克唐纳在19日发表声明，谴责艾森豪威尔政府这种为垄断资本效劳的政策。他说，“政府的行动力量正在被利用来取得富有的、强大的钢铁工业永远得不到的某些东西。这就是迫使钢铁工人在没有得到他们有权得到的公平合理的解决情况下复工。”（美国）国际电气工会主席凯雷在21日指出，这再一次证明艾森豪威尔明显地同大垄断集团“站在一起”，“并且宣誓效忠于他们的‘利润高于一切’的哲学”。钢铁罢工目前已经超过了一百天，是战后以来美国最长的一次钢铁罢工。（附图片）
