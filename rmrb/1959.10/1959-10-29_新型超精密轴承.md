    New Ultra-Precision Bearings
    (Our dispatch) The Harbin Bearing Factory recently successfully trial-produced China's first batch of C7132 tapered ultra-precision bearings and C8120 thrust ultra-precision bearings. After evaluation, the quality of these two types of bearings has fully reached the advanced international level.
    These two types of ultra-precision bearings are cutting-edge products in the bearing industry. They are bearings used on the spindles of ultra-precision machine tools. After ultra-precision machine tools are equipped with these bearings, the processing accuracy can be doubled.
    The birth of these two types of ultra-precision bearings is the result of the Harbin Bearing Factory adhering to the general line and opposing right-leaning tendencies and going all out. Two years ago, users requested the factory to produce these two types of bearings, but some cadres were daunted by the difficulties and did not dare to accept. After last year's Great Leap Forward and the recent opposition to right-leaning tendencies and going all out, the workers are in high spirits, full of fighting spirit, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally successfully trial-produced them.

    新型超精密轴承
    本报讯　哈尔滨轴承厂最近试制成功了我国第一批C7132圆锥型超精密轴承和C8120推力型超精密轴承。经过鉴定，这两种轴承的质量完全达到了国际先进水平。
    这两种超精密轴承，是轴承工业的尖端产品。它是用在超精密工作母机主轴上的轴承。超精密机床装上这种轴承以后，加工的精度可以提高一倍。
    这两种超精密轴承的诞生，是哈尔滨轴承厂坚持总路线和反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。两年前，就曾有用户要求这个厂生产这两种轴承，当时部分干部畏难不敢接受。经过去年大跃进和最近反右倾鼓干劲以后，职工们意气风发，斗志昂扬，克服了重重困难，终于试制成功。
