　　Cultural Workers Gather at Ministry of Culture Event
    Unanimously Praising the Victory of Mao Zedong's Literary and Artistic Thought
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Culture recently held a reception to express gratitude to the famous actors of various ethnic groups from all over the country and cultural and artistic figures from Beijing who participated in the National Day performance celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. More than 300 cultural and artistic workers gathered together, unanimously cheering the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and enthusiastically praising the wise leadership of the Party and the glorious victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

　　Among those attending the reception were famous actors and directors from various operas and films, well-known artists from the music, dance, and fine arts circles, as well as experts from the cultural relics and publishing fields. They came from more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as professional and amateur art units from the Chinese People's Liberation Army system and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions system, including more than a dozen ethnic groups.

　　Before the dinner, a discussion was held. Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture, expressed his gratitude to all the actors and staff who participated in the National Day performance for their hard work and outstanding achievements, and encouraged everyone to continue their efforts and make more contributions to the motherland. Then, Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui spoke, pointing out that the National Day performance and the exhibitions of films, cultural relics, fine arts, etc. during the National Day period were actually a review of China's literary and artistic achievements over the past ten years, and a concentrated expression of the great leap forward in the literary and artistic cause. The national model workers, representatives of ethnic minorities, representatives of overseas Chinese, and foreign guests who participated in the National Day celebrations gave high praise to the National Day performance and various exhibitions. They praised these performances and exhibitions for demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese people and the thriving picture of blooming flowers and innovation in the literary and artistic garden. Qian Junrui said that the achievement of these accomplishments is the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction in the literary and artistic field, and the victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought.

　　Lao She, Mei Lanfang, Cui Wei, Ma Shizeng, Shi Lemeng, Jiang Zhaohe, Chang Xiangyu, Guo Baojun, Fang Xiaotian, Yu Zhenfei and others spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their boundless excitement and excitement for the motherland's brilliant achievements and great future. And with their own experiences and feelings, they explained that only under the shining light of the Party's general line for socialist construction and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought can the cultural and artistic cause achieve such vigorous development.

　　Lao She said: The development of the motherland is progressing rapidly. Seeing so many new achievements, I can only use the phrase "shocked" to express my excitement. He said: The people's great leap forward inspires artists to move forward. Writers and artists can only write rich in content and noble in style works by being with the people. Mei Lanfang pointed out: In the past ten years, thousands of lost repertoires have regained their brilliance, the art of famous masters of various schools has been inherited and developed, and a large number of new forces have emerged. This situation fully proves the correctness of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and the superiority of the socialist system. Yu opera actress Chang Xiangyu said: Yu opera was a "rough clapper opera" that was looked down upon before liberation. At that time, the better the female actors sang, the greater the possibility of being insulted and devastated. After liberation, with the leadership and care of the Party, we stood up straight and became actors serving the people. She thanked the Party for giving her the opportunity to perform on the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in the border areas, in factories, and in the countryside, so that she could clarify the purpose of art in revolutionary struggle and artistic practice, embark on the correct path of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become a glorious Communist Party member. Kunqu Opera actor Yu Zhenfei said: Under the Party's meticulous care and encouragement, not only was Kunqu Opera, which was almost extinct before liberation, revived, but it also gained new life. For example, "Qiang Tou Ma Shang", which was performed this time for the National Day celebration, is an excellent traditional repertoire that has been lost for three or four hundred years. It was only compiled under the suggestion and inspiration of a responsible comrade of the Party. Cantonese opera actress Hong Xiannu wrote a poem after the meeting, enthusiastically praising the grand occasion of sunshine shining all over the motherland's great garden, with spring colors filling the garden and a myriad of colors. She thanked the gardeners for their diligent cultivation and thanked the Party for its correct leadership of literary and artistic work.

　　Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Yang, spoke at the meeting. Zhou Yang said that from this National Day performance and the publications and exhibitions, we can see the achievements of the great leap forward in the cultural and artistic circles, and we can see a vigorous revolutionary spirit. This spirit comes from communist consciousness and demonstrates the communist style. This spirit enables our literary and artistic workers to work day and night, regardless of remuneration, and cooperate in unity under the great goal of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialist construction. No matter how superior the material conditions and technology of bourgeois artists are, they can never understand our spirit. Zhou Yang then focused on expounding the Party's general line for building socialism and the Party's literary and artistic line. He said that the Party's line shines on the direction of progress for our country's literary and artistic workers. The current task of the people of the whole country is to build our country into a strong socialist country with a high level of industry and a high level of culture. Zhou Yang said that we must make all the people of the country have culture, and we must also make our science and culture reach the most advanced level in the world, and produce many outstanding writers and artists who are worthy of the great era. This task is more glorious and arduous than at any time in the past. All literary and artistic workers should have this national confidence and class confidence, work hard, and in the long-term revolutionary struggle and labor life, combine with the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers and working people, and create a new era of socialist and communist culture and art in China.

　　During the dinner, many actors and singers sang impromptu, and the venue was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Also present at the reception were Vice Ministers of Culture Xia Yan, Hu Yuzhi, and Lin Mohan, Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Jiang Siyi, and heads of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Lü Ji, and Cai Ruohong.

　　文化部盛会上文化艺术工作者济济一堂
    同声歌颂毛泽东文艺思想的胜利
    新华社讯　文化部最近举行招待会，慰劳在首都参加庆祝建国十周年献礼演出的各地各族著名演员和北京的文化艺术界人士。三百多位文化艺术工作者济济一堂，同声欢呼祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就，热情歌颂党的英明领导和毛泽东文艺思想的光辉胜利。
    参加这次招待会的有各剧种和电影方面的著名演员、导演，有音乐、舞蹈、美术界的知名艺术家，还有文物、出版界的专家们。他们来自二十多个省、市、自治区，以及中国人民解放军系统和中华全国总工会系统的专业和业余艺术单位，包括十多个民族。
    在聚餐以前，举行了座谈，文化部长沈雁冰代表文化部对参加国庆献礼演出的全体演员、工作人员的辛勤劳动和优异成就表示感谢，并鼓励大家继续发挥干劲，为祖国作出更多的贡献。接着文化部副部长钱俊瑞讲话指出，这次献礼演出和国庆期间电影、文物、美术等方面的展览，实际上是我国十年来文艺成就的检阅，是文艺事业大跃进的集中表现。参加国庆观礼的全国劳动模范、少数民族代表、华侨代表以及各国外宾对这次献礼演出和各种展览给予很高的评价，他们盛赞这些演出和展览表现了中国人民的英雄气概和文艺园地中百花齐放、推陈出新的兴旺图景。钱俊瑞说，这些成就的取得，是党的社会主义建设总路线在文艺领域中的胜利，是毛主席文艺思想的胜利。
    老舍、梅兰芳、崔蒐、马师曾、时乐蒙、蒋兆和、常香玉、郭宝钧、方晓天、俞振飞等在会上作了发言，他们一致为祖国的灿烂成就和伟大前途感到无限的激动和兴奋。并且用他们切身的经验和感受，说明了只有在党的社会主义建设总路线和毛主席文艺思想的光辉照耀下，文化艺术事业才能得到这样蓬勃的发展。
    老舍说：祖国的发展一日千里，看到许多新的成就，只能用“吓一跳”这句话来表现自己激动的心情。他说：人民的大跃进鼓舞着艺术家们的前进。作家艺术家只有同人民在一起，才能写出内容丰富、风格高尚的作品来。梅兰芳指出：十年来千百个失传的剧目重放光芒，各派名家的艺术得以继承和发扬，新生力量大批涌现出来，这种情况充分证明了党的百花齐放推陈出新方针的正确和社会主义制度的优越性。豫剧名演员常香玉说：豫剧在解放前是被人看不起的“粗梆子”，那时的女演员戏越唱的好，受污辱受摧残的可能性就越大。解放后，有了党的领导和关怀，我们才挺起了胸膛，成了为人民服务的演员。她感谢党给她到抗美援朝前线、边疆、工厂、农村演出的机会，使她在革命斗争和艺术实践中明确了艺术的目的，走上为工农兵服务的正确道路，并且成为一个光荣的共产党员。昆曲名演员俞振飞说：在党的无微不至的关怀和鼓励下，不但使解放前几乎断了种的昆曲得以复苏，而且获得了新的生命，如这一次献礼演出的“墙头马上”是湮没三四百年的优秀传统剧目，就是在一位党的负责同志的建议和启发下，才整理出来的。粤剧名演员红线女在会后作了一首诗，热情地歌颂祖国的大花园中阳光照遍，春色满园，万紫千红的盛况。她感谢园丁的殷勤培育，感谢党对于文艺工作的正确领导。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬在会上讲了话。周扬说，从这次国庆献礼演出和出版、展览中，可以看出文化艺术界大跃进的成就，可以看出一股蓬蓬勃勃的革命干劲。这种干劲来自共产主义的觉悟，表现出共产主义的风格。这种干劲使我们的文艺工作者在为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务的伟大目标下，夜以继日地工作，不计报酬，团结协作。资产阶级的艺术家不论他有多么优越的物质条件和技术，但是他们永远也不可能理解我们的这种精神。周扬接着着重阐述了党的建设社会主义总路线和党的文艺路线。他说，党的路线照耀着我国文艺工作者的前进方向。当前全国人民的任务是要把我国建设成为一个具有高度工业水平和高度文化的社会主义强国。周扬说，我们要使全国人民都有文化，还要使我们的科学文化达到世界最先进的水平，产生许许多多无愧于伟大时代的出色的作家和艺术家。这个任务比过去任何一个时期都更为光荣和艰巨，全体文艺工作者应该有这种民族的信心和阶级的信心，发奋图强，在长期的革命斗争和劳动生活中，同工农兵广大劳动人民相结合，在中国开创社会主义、共产主义文化艺术的新时代。
    在聚餐过程中，许多演员和歌唱家即兴演唱，会场上充满了欢乐的气氛。出席这次招待会的还有文化部副部长夏衍、胡愈之、林默涵，中国人民解放军总政治部宣传部部长姜思毅，中国文联和各协会负责人阳翰笙、田汉、吕骥、蔡若虹等。
