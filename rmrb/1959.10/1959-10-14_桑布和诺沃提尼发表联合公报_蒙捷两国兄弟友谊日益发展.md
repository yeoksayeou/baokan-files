The joint communiqué stated that the friendly visit of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic to the Mongolian People's Republic was conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity, understanding, and solidarity. The visit greatly promoted the fraternal friendship between the two peoples and consolidated the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The communiqué pointed out that the talks held between the party and government leaders of Mongolia and Czechoslovakia demonstrated that the two sides held completely identical views on further promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries and on the current international situation.

The communiqué stated that Mongolia and Czechoslovakia fully supported the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and praised the results of the visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States. The peaceful foreign policy resolutely pursued by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has created favorable conditions for promoting the resolution of all international issues through negotiation.

The communiqué stated that Mongolia and Czechoslovakia unanimously condemned the acts of imperialist countries in interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and that the formation of military blocs by imperialism threatens many Asian countries.

The communiqué stated that Mongolia and Czechoslovakia believe that the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored immediately, and expressed support for China's policy of returning its inseparable territory of Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland.

Both sides expressed full support for the desire of the Korean and Vietnamese peoples to peacefully resolve the Korean and Vietnamese issues, and support the policies pursued by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Czechoslovak Republic reiterated that the Mongolian People's Republic should become a member of the United Nations.

The delegations of the two parties pointed out that this development is inseparable from the new and great upsurge of international communist forces that emerged after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
