    The Secret of the Far Side of the Moon Unveiled
     Xinhua News Agency Commentary
    The photographs of the far side of the moon taken by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station have been published. The secret of the far side of the moon has been unveiled. This is not only a major event in the scientific community but also a major event in human history.
    Since the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket to the moon, the moon has entered the scope of human activity. Never before have people around the world paid so much attention to this beautiful celestial body that has illuminated our nights for thousands of years. However, until now, people have never "peeked" at its full appearance. It has always been like a "pipa player half concealing her face." From ancient astrologers to astronomers who can use the most modern telescopes, they have observed and compared the moon for thousands of years. Whenever the moon shines on earth, they always find that its face never turns around. That is to say, they can only see one side of it and never see its far side.
    Originally, the moon revolves around the earth on one side and rotates around its own axis on the other. If the time it takes for the moon to revolve around the earth is not the same as the time it takes for it to rotate on its own axis, then people on earth can gradually see all parts of the moon's surface during the moon's rotation. But the fact is not the case. The time it takes for the moon to revolve around the earth is exactly the same as the time it takes for it to rotate on its own axis. Therefore, we can only see one side of it.
    However, due to the moon's "wobbling" (libration), the side of the moon seen by humans from Earth is not exactly half, but 59% of it. There are several reasons for this.
    First, because the moon's orbit is an ellipse, the Earth is not at the center of the ellipse but at one of its foci. The moon's speed during its revolution is not uniform, while the moon's rotation rate is uniform. Therefore, it inevitably leans slightly to the east or west when revolving around the Earth. Seen from Earth, when the moon leans slightly to the side during its orbit, people can see a little bit more of the scenery on its east and west sides. Astronomically, this wobble is called "longitudinal libration."
    Secondly, because the moon's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane but has an inclination of about six degrees. Therefore, during its rotation, it inevitably lowers its head or raises it slightly for the Earth, allowing us to see a little bit more of the back side beyond the lunar north pole or a little bit more of the back side beyond the lunar south pole. This wobble is called "latitudinal libration."
    Adding other reasons for the "wobbling" has increased the knowledge of the lunar surface accumulated by astronomers for thousands of years by 9%. The other 41% of the secrets, the moon has never revealed to mankind, and mankind suffers from not having a neck more than 380,000 kilometers long to explore the true face of Lushan Mountain.
    Now, this age-old mystery has been solved. This is the outstanding achievement of Soviet scientists and another milestone in mankind's conquest of the universe. Understanding the entire true face of the moon brings the great moment when human footprints will set foot on the moon closer.
    The Soviet Union launched the first automatic interplanetary station in human history and took the first batch of photographs of the far side of the moon in human history, demonstrating the advanced nature of Soviet science and technology and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This event made progressive people all over the world rejoice, while the American ruling clique was greatly shocked and discouraged. They blamed each other and quarreled. York, the director of scientific research at the Pentagon in the United States, said that the United States' backward state would last for at least seven years. Everyone still remembers that von Braun, the former German rocket expert regarded as the "trump card" by the US government, said not long ago that the United States was five years behind the Soviet Union, and in just a few months the gap had increased by another two years. This expert, in addition to lamenting that the United States is "greatly behind," is also complaining because he has not received appropriate attention in the US Army system and is preparing to resign. Medaris, the director of the US Army Intercontinental Missile Research Bureau, also intends to resign. This news caused US President Eisenhower and the US Department of Defense a great headache. Eisenhower hurriedly declared on the 21st that he would ask Congress to approve the transfer of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency to the US Interstellar and Space Navigation Agency for management. Changing the soup but not the medicine, the result is still the same old routine. Johnson, another expert at the Pentagon, has seen through everything and announced that he will devote himself to art work in the future.
    The Soviet Union's publication of the scientifically valuable photographs of the far side of the moon illustrates the Soviet Union's selfless spirit of seeking benefits for all mankind. This once again exposes the slander of the American reactionaries who clamor that the Soviet Union does not publish the scientific data of rockets and artificial satellites. When Soviet scientist Fyodorov recently refuted this slander by the American reactionaries, he mentioned many facts showing that it is the United States itself that does not publish scientific data. But despite the American bourgeoisie's belief in monopolizing scientific data, Soviet science, using its own strength, has left it far behind.

    月球背影的秘密揭开了
     新华社记者述评
    苏联自动行星际站拍摄的月球背面的照片已经公布。月球的背影的秘密揭开了。这不但是科学界的一件大事，也是人类历史的一件大事。
    自从苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭以来，月球已经进入了人类活动的范围。全世界的人从来也没有今天这样注意这个千百年来为我们照亮黑夜的美丽的天体。但是，到现在，人们还从没有“窥见”过它的全貌呢，它始终是“犹抱琵琶半遮面”似地对着我们。从古代的星象家起一直到能使用最现代化的望远镜的天文学家，对月球进行了千百年的观测和比较，他们在每当月球照临人间的时候，总是发现它脸庞老不转过来。就是说只能看到它的一面，始终看不到它的背影。
    原来月球一面绕着地球公转，一面又绕着自己的轴心自转。假如月球绕地球公转一周的时间和它自转一周的时间不相同，那末，在地球上的人就可以在月球的运转过程中，陆续地看到月球表面的各个部分了。但事实并不是这样，月球公转一周的时间恰恰和它自转一周的时间一样。因此，我们始终只能看到它的一面。
    但是，由于月球运行有些“摆动”（天平动），人类从地球上所看到的月球一面，并不是恰好一半，而是它的59％。这有好几个原因。
    第一，因为月球的公转轨道是一个椭圆，地球不在椭圆的中心，而在椭圆的一个焦点上，月球在公转过程中的速度并不均匀，而月球自转速率却是均匀的。因此，绕地球运转时不免向东或者向西侧过一点身子。从地球上看，月球在运行周期中侧过一点身子时，人们便可以多看到它东西边的一点点背面的情景。天文学上称这种摆动为“经天平动”。
    其次，因为月球自转轴与轨道面并不是垂直的，而有六度左右的倾斜。因此，它在转动过程中，对地球来说，不免头有时低一点，有时仰一点，使我们可以多看到月球北极以外一点点或南极以外一点点背面。这种摆动称为“纬天平动”。
    加上其他一些原因引起的“摆动”，使天文学家千百年来积累的月球表面的知识增加了9％。其它的41％的秘密，月球始终不向人类吐露，人类苦于没有三十八万多公里长的颈项，能够一探庐山的真面。
    现在，这个千古哑谜揭开了。这是苏联科学家的旷世功勋，是人类征服宇宙的又一个里程碑。了解了月球的全部真面目，人类的足迹踏上月球的伟大时刻更临近了。
    苏联发射了人类史上第一个自动行星际站，摄得了人类史上第一批月球背面的照片，显示了苏联科学技术的先进和社会主义制度的无比优越性。这件事使全世界进步人类欢欣鼓舞，而美国统治集团却大为震惊，灰心丧气。他们互相埋怨，吵作一团。美国五角大楼的科学研究主任约克说，美国的落后状态至少要持续七年。大家还记得，被美国政府视为“王牌”的前德国火箭专家布劳恩在不久前还说美国比苏联落后五年，在短短几个月内落后距离又增加了两年。这位专家现在除了惊叹美国“大大的落后了”以外，又因在美国陆军系统中得不到适当的器重而大发牢骚，准备掼纱帽不干了。美国陆军洲际导弹研究局局长梅德里斯也有辞职之意。这个消息使美国总统艾森豪威尔和美国国防部大伤脑筋。艾森豪威尔慌忙在21日宣称，他将要求国会通过，把陆军弹道导弹机关移交美国星际和空间航行局管理。换汤不换药，结果还是老一套。五角大楼另一专家詹逊已看穿了一切，宣布今后准备致力于美术工作了。
    苏联公布月球背面的具有重大科学价值的照片，说明了苏联为整个人类谋福利的大公无私的精神。这又一次揭穿了美国反动派叫嚣的所谓苏联不公布火箭和人造卫星的科学资料的谰言。苏联科学家费奥多罗夫不久前批驳美国反动派的这种污蔑的谰言时，曾经提到许多事实说明，不公布科学资料的正是美国自己。但尽管美国资产阶级抱着垄断科学资料的信条，苏联科学运用自己的力量，已经远远地把它抛在后面了。
