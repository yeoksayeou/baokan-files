Let Socialism Take Root Deeply in People's Hearts
Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang Launch Mass Self-Education Movements

(Our report) A massive and magnificent socialist construction general line education movement, centered on publicizing and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, is being widely and deeply carried out in the vast rural areas of Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang and other provinces.

Since the previous period of publicizing and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the unhealthy trends and evil practices in the rural areas of these provinces have been suppressed, and the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants have been further increased, and the production work and the various tasks of the people's communes have been put on the road of sound development. The vast majority of cadres and masses are delighted with this thriving and prosperous situation and are full of confidence in striving for a greater harvest. However, a few cadres and masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the leaping development situation, and have varying degrees of right-leaning thoughts and emotions. Some wealthy peasants with more serious capitalist thoughts are taking the opportunity to spread negative thoughts and dissatisfaction among the masses. In view of this situation, these provinces have launched a socialist construction general line education movement since the beginning of October. Through education, the vast number of commune members have drawn a clear line between the two roads, further raised their political and ideological awareness, and are determined to raise the banners of the people's communes, the general line, and the great leap forward even higher and forge ahead courageously, thereby more forcefully promoting the in-depth development of the autumn increase production and economize movement.

Local experiences have proved that to carry out the socialist education movement, it is first necessary to carry out airing of views and debates among the vast number of cadres and masses, so that everyone can express their opinions and speak freely, so that all kinds of opinions can be fully exposed, so that all kinds of problems can be carefully solved one by one. Wherever this is done, the effect is very good. When the Zhende Brigade of the Guizhou Commune in Fanshun County, Guangdong Province, started the movement, it paid attention to dispelling the ideological concerns of cadres and masses, and let everyone fully expose their thoughts, so that everyone spoke their minds. Some upper-middle peasants said: "Last year's Great Leap Forward only focused on agricultural production, squeezed out sideline production, which is equivalent to a daughter-in-law running away from home." Poor peasants said: "It's not that a daughter-in-law ran away, but that a daughter-in-law was married into the family." Everyone also cited the facts: last year, not only did the crops increase significantly in the entire brigade, but also many sideline productions increased by one and a half times, and the number of live pigs increased from 944 in 1957 to 2,380. Upper-middle peasant Huo Yao said: The Great Leap Forward destroyed more houses than it built. Everyone argued with him: last year, only twelve small mud houses that were dilapidated and uninhabitable were demolished, but thirteen large brick houses were newly built, and three large bungalows were rebuilt, so that the team had public canteens, children's playgrounds, as well as silkworm houses and pigsties. How can it be said that more were demolished than built? With such full airing of views and debates, the truth will naturally become clearer and clearer, so that the vast majority of people will be educated and the line between right and wrong will be drawn. In the early stage of the movement in some communes in the Foshan area of Guangdong Province, some cadres did not dare to let go of mobilizing the masses to air their views and debates, fearing that it would be difficult to solve the problems if the opinions were aired, and the movement could not be carried out smoothly.

Experience has also proved that adopting the method of recollection, comparison and accounting is a very important task in carrying out the socialist education movement, and it must be done with the greatest effort. When calculating accounts, first calculate the accounts of the entire commune and the entire brigade, both the accounts since the communization and the accounts of the past ten years, and then calculate the accounts of each household and everyone. In this regard, various places have created many extremely effective methods. Ruyi Brigade of Shaoshan Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, and Shatou Commune in Fanshun County, Guangdong Province, focused on calculating the advantages of the people's commune. Some wealthy middle peasants in Shatou Commune believed that the achievements of communization were not great, and everyone presented the facts and calculated the detailed accounts: more than ten factories were newly built in the entire commune, and twenty-six highways were built, with a total length of sixty-seven kilometers, making the remote areas have a transportation network. Under the conditions of convenient transportation, the work of transforming backward fields was also accelerated, and more than 5,700 mu of backward fields have been transformed into good fields. After communization, nurseries and public canteens were also established, liberating women's labor force. Everyone said: If it weren't for communization, who could afford to do so many things? People who say that the commune has no achievements are lying with their eyes open. Each production team of Ruyi Brigade summarized the advantages of the commune from their own practical experience, listing more than ten or twenty advantages, of which Shishan Production Team can be their representative. Before liberation, only two households had enough to eat and surplus, and one household could basically maintain food and clothing, except for landlords and rich peasants. The other thirty households depended on loans and begging. After liberation, although the living conditions have improved, due to the too thin foundation, they could not withstand natural and man-made disasters, and some even sold the fruits of victory divided by the land reform. During the advanced cooperative, more than thirty households still could not get back all the rations every year. After the people's commune, the commune members no longer worry about eating, and everyone is in a happy mood and actively participates in production, so their income increases. According to the annual distribution budget per household, the average income per person in the entire team can be more than 68 yuan, an increase of 58.28% compared with 1957. When they summarized the advantages of the commune's large scale and high degree of public ownership, they particularly praised: in the past year, they have established basic construction such as two mines, seven factories, four farms, two stations, and two warehouses, including silica sand mines, coal mines, machinery factories, fertilizer factories, reservoirs, pastures, forest farms, hydropower stations, automobile tractor stations, etc. Among them, the Youth Reservoir irrigates more than 20,000 mu of fertile land in the entire commune, and more than 3,000 mu of land in this brigade benefits from it. Even in the case of continuous drought for more than 50 days, there was no disaster, and the commune members called it the "Happiness Reservoir." When they talked about the people's commune establishing public welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, fully exploiting labor potential, many female commune members described that going to work in the past was "locking the door when going out, and no fire when entering the door," but now it is "hot food and hot dishes, eating happily," "food is cooked and the mouth is open, eat and leave," and can concentrate on production. In terms of animal husbandry production, expanding the planting of cash crops, the integration of government and commune, and the development of cultural, educational and health undertakings, the commune members all talked about the many benefits of the people's commune, and said in unison: From land reform to mutual aid groups to agricultural cooperatives, it is a step-by-step promotion, and from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes, it is an even greater promotion.

Some places, such as Tancheng County in Shandong, conducted extremely vivid self-education for the vast number of cadres and commune members by summarizing the changes in the past ten years through village-by-village exhibitions and household-by-household recollections and comparisons. Baihe Commune used the examples of the changes in the lives of 161 commune member households to hold an exhibition of comparisons between the past and the present, displaying more than 1,500 pieces of real objects such as broken jackets, broken clothes, begging sticks, begging bowls, and carrying poles and baskets used for fleeing famine before liberation, while displaying new agricultural machinery such as walking plows, buffaloes, water pumps, and tractors. The comparison exhibition of the past and the present is explained by the parties concerned. This educational method, which combines the virtual and the real, and sees both people and objects, is clear about right and wrong, lively and vivid, and touches people's hearts. The people who visited all reflected: "If you don't think about it and don't look at it, you are confused. Once you think about it and look at it, you are clear." Li Guangsheng, the former production team leader of Fan Village, originally doubted the Great Leap Forward and was passive in his work. After visiting, he recalled the pain of being a hired worker and begging in the past, and looked at the changes now. He made a self-criticism on the spot and said: "I am not aware of the blessings I am in, and I really have no conscience." The next day, before dawn, he personally led the commune members to the sweet potato field to apply fertilizer. After visiting the real object exhibition, Xie Lansong, a commune member of Qianpang Village in Honghua Commune, brought out a carrying pole, two baskets, a begging stick, and five cotton quilts, leather shoes, and new clothes used when fleeing famine before liberation, introduced himself to everyone, and raised his hands and shouted "Long live the Communist Party, long live the People's Commune!" Donghu Commune in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, recalled the changes in the past ten years and found out the reasons for the changes through group discussions, general meetings, photo exhibitions, and real object visits. The masses generally reflected: the more they think about it, the more interesting it is, the more they look at it, the happier they are, and the brighter the road becomes.

Experience also proves that in the socialist education movement, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's class line in the rural areas and clearly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. According to a survey in Guangdong Province, the poor and lower-middle peasants, who account for 80% of the rural population, resolutely support the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. In this airing of views and debates, they firmly stood their ground and argued理直气壮ly with some people with serious capitalist thoughts. Therefore, by relying closely on them, the movement can achieve complete victory.

　　让社会主义深入人心
    山东湖南广东浙江开展群众自我教育运动
    本报讯　一个声势浩大、波澜壮阔的以宣传贯彻党的八届八中全会为中心内容的社会主义建设总路线教育运动，正在山东、湖南、广东、浙江等省广大农村广泛深入地开展起来。
    这几个省自从前一时期宣传贯彻了党的八届八中全会的精神以后，农村中的歪风邪气已经被打下去，贫农和下中农的政治积极性和生产积极性进一步高涨起来，生产工作和人民公社的各项工作更加走上了健全发展的道路。绝大部分干部和群众对这种蒸蒸日上的繁荣局面欢欣鼓舞，对争取更大丰收充满了信心。但也有少数干部、群众对跃进形势认识不足，存在程度不同的右倾思想和右倾情绪，一部分具有比较严重的资本主义思想的富裕农民，更乘机在群众中散布消极思想和不满情绪。根据这种情况，从10月上旬开始，这几个省都先后开展了社会主义建设总路线教育运动。通过教育，广大社员划清了两条道路的界限，进一步提高了政治思想觉悟，决心更高地举起人民公社、总路线、大跃进的旗帜奋勇前进，从而更有力地推动了秋季增产节约运动的深入开展。
    各地经验证明：开展社会主义教育运动，首先要在广大干部、群众中开展鸣放、辩论，让各人抒发己见，畅所欲言，使各种言论充分暴露出来，才能够细致地把各种问题一一加以解决。凡是这样做的地方，效果就很好。广东省番顺县桂洲公社振德大队在运动开始时，即注意打消干部、群众思想顾虑，让大家充分暴露思想，大家心里话都说出来了。有些上中农说：“去年大跃进只抓了农业生产，挤掉了副业生产，等于家里跑了一个媳妇”。贫农说：“不是跑了个媳妇，而是娶了个媳妇”。大家还举出事实：去年全大队不仅农作物显著增产，许多副业生产也增加一倍半，生猪就由1957年的九百四十四头增至二千三百八十头。上中农霍耀说：大跃进破坏的屋多，新建的屋少。大家和他争论：去年只不过拆去了十二间风雨飘摇不能住人的小泥屋，却新建了十三间大砖屋，改建了三间大平房，使队里有了公共食堂、儿童乐园，还有蚕房、猪舍，怎么能说是拆的多、建的少了呢？像这样充分鸣放、辩论，道理自然会越辩越明白，从而使极大多数人受到了教育，划清了是非界限。广东省佛山专区个别公社在运动开展初期，有部分干部不敢放手发动群众鸣放、辩论，担心把意见鸣放出来，不好解决，运动就不能顺利开展。
    经验还证明：采取回忆、对比和算账的办法，是开展社会主义教育运动中一项极为重要的工作，必须用最大的力量把它做好。算账时，先算全公社、全大队的账，既算公社化以来的账，也算十年来的账，然后户户算账，人人算账。在这方面各地都创造了许多极为有效的办法。湖南省湘潭县韶山公社如意大队和广东省番顺县沙头公社着重算人民公社优越性的账。沙头公社部分富裕中农认为公社化成绩不大，大家摆事实，算细账：全公社新建了工厂十多间，修筑了公路二十六条，全长六十七公里，使偏僻地区有了交通网。在交通运输方便的条件下，又加快了改造落后田的工作，前后已把五千七百多亩落后田改造成良田。公社化后，还办了托儿所、公共食堂，解放了妇女劳动力。大家说：不是公社化，谁能办得起这样多事情，说公社没有成绩的人是睁着眼睛说瞎话。如意大队各个生产队都从各自的实际体会出发，总结出公社的优越性，一数就是十多条、二十多条，狮山生产队可作他们的代表。这个队解放前除地主、富农外，只有两户有吃有剩，一户基本上能维持温饱，其他三十多户都靠借贷、讨乞度日。解放后，生活虽有所改善，但由于底子太薄，经不起天灾人祸，有的又把土改分的胜利果实变卖了，到高级社时，每年还有三十多户拿不回全部口粮。人民公社化后，社员们不再为吃饭问题发愁了，个个心情舒畅，生产积极，因而收入增加。据全年分配预算到户，全队平均每人可收入六十八元多，比1957年增加58.28％，他们在总结公社一大二公的优越性时，特别赞美地提到：一年来兴办了两矿、七厂、四场、两站、两库等基本建设，包括矽砂矿、煤矿、机械厂、化肥厂、水库、牧场、林场、水电站、汽车拖拉机站等，其中的青年水库，灌溉着全社二万多亩良田，这个大队就有三千多亩田受益，在连续干旱五十多天的情况下，也没有成灾，社员们叫它“幸福水库”。他们谈到人民公社兴办了公共食堂、托儿所等公共福利事业，充分挖掘了劳动潜力时，许多女社员形容过去出工是“出门一把锁，进门没得火”，现在是“热饭热菜，吃得心爱”，“饭熟口开，吃了走开”，可以一心一意搞生产。在畜牧生产、扩种经济作物、政社合一、发展文教卫生事业等方面，社员们都谈了人民公社的许多好处，异口同声地说：从土改到互助组到农业社，是步步高升，从农业社到人民公社，更是大大高升。
    有些地方如山东郯城县通过村村展览，户户回忆、用对比的办法总结十年来的变化，对广大干部和社员进行极为生动的自我教育。白河公社利用一百六十一户社员生活变化的实例，举办了今昔对比展览会，一边陈列着解放前穿的破烂不堪的破袄、破衣和用过的要饭棍、要饭瓢以及逃荒用的担子、筐子等一千五百多件实物，一边陈列着步犁、水牛、抽水机、拖拉机等新式农械。今昔生活的对比展览，都由当事人讲解。这种虚实并举、既见人又见物的教育方法，是非分明，生动活泼，打动人心。参观的人纷纷反映：“不想不看糊里糊涂，一想一看清清楚楚。”凡村生产队长李广胜原来怀疑大跃进，工作消极疲沓，经过参观后，回忆起个人过去当雇工、要饭的痛苦，看看现在的变化，当场检讨说：“我是身在福中不知福，真是没有良心了。”第二天天还不亮就亲自带领社员下地向地瓜地里追肥。红花公社前?口生产队，社员谢兰松参观实物展览后，回家将解放前逃荒时用的一条扁担、两个筐篮、一根要饭棍和现在的五床棉被、皮鞋、新衣等实物搬出来一边向大家自我介绍，一边举手高呼“共产党万岁，人民公社万岁！”浙江省绍兴县东湖公社城东生产队通过小组座谈、大会发言、图片展览、实物参观等形式，回忆十年变化，找出变化原因。群众普遍反映：越想越有味，越看越高兴，道路越走越光明。
    经验同时证明：在社会主义教育运动中，必须坚决贯彻党在农村的阶级路线，明确依靠贫农和下中农。根据广东省的调查，占农村人口80％的贫农和下中农对于社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社是坚决拥护的。在这次鸣放、辩论中，他们坚决站稳立场，理直气壮地和部分有严重资本主义思想的人进行争辩，因此，紧紧依靠他们，运动就可以取得全胜。
