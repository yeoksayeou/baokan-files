　　Four Academic Masterpieces of Utopian Socialists Recently Published by The Commercial Press

　　The Commercial Press, whose main task is to translate and publish famous foreign academic works, both ancient and modern, has recently published four Western European Utopian Socialist works: "Selected Works of Fourier" Volumes 1 and 2 (the complete book has four volumes), Francis Bacon's "New Atlantis," Jean Meslier's "Testament" Volume 1 (the complete book has three volumes), and William Godwin's "Concerning Property." Except for "New Atlantis," which had a translation before liberation and has now been re-translated, the rest are translated into Chinese for the first time. The quality of the translation is relatively good.

　　"New Atlantis" is an unfinished work written in his later years by Bacon (1561-1626), the founder of modern British materialism and a great scientist and thinker, and published in 1627, the year after his death. Bacon grew up in the era of the "prelude to the British bourgeois revolution." The rise of capitalist production promoted the development of natural science. The ideal society described by Bacon in "New Atlantis" extends human control over nature to the extreme. The social reform plan he proposed in his ideal plan reflected the real struggle of the society at that time, which was the struggle of the emerging bourgeoisie against the British autocratic regime.

　　This work occupies a special place in the early utopian works. Although Bacon's new science and technology were intended to serve social liberation and eliminate poverty, in reality, they only served to strengthen the power of capital. Such ideals can only be truly realized in our socialist-communist country.

　　"Testament" is an outstanding work written by Jean Meslier (1664-1729), the pioneer of French Utopian Socialism in the 18th century and the most resolute atheist. This book was circulated in manuscript form after Meslier's death. Voltaire published an abridged version in 1762, and it was not fully published until 1864.

　　Meslier was born into a family of rural textile workers. After graduating from a church school, he served as a priest. Because he lived with poor peasants in the countryside for a long time, sympathized with the tragic situation of the working people, and realized that religion was only a tool used by the exploiting classes to oppress the people, he wrote this book to expose the superstition, fallacies, and deception of religion. He indignantly told people that they should resolutely abandon their harmful beliefs in religion and actively engage in the struggle against exploitation and oppression. He advocated the establishment of a new society based on the public ownership of property—a commune alliance; in the commune, everyone participates in labor and shares the fruits of labor together. Meslier's thought reflected the social aspirations and political views of the working masses at that time, especially the poor peasants. His social outlook has a petty-bourgeois egalitarian color. "Testament" is not only a famous Utopian Socialist work, but also an outstanding document of militant atheism. Engels and Lenin both instructed us to translate the documents of militant atheism of the 18th century one by one and "widely disseminate them to the people." The publication of the Chinese translation of "Testament" is a beginning of our work in this regard.

　　William Godwin (1756-1836), the author of "Concerning Property," was a radical writer in 18th-century England. He was engaged in literary activities throughout his life, and his main works were novels, and he also wrote some political and historical works. "Concerning Property" is an essay in his political essay "Political Justice and Its Influence on Morality and Happiness" written during the French Revolution in 1793. In this essay, Godwin sharply criticized the private property system, especially the capitalist private property system, from the principle of reason. He pointed out that private ownership is the root of all evils, and a society based on private ownership is a society of violence and deception. In order to uphold human reason and justice, he demanded the establishment of an ideal society without private ownership. In this society, distribution should not be based on ownership, nor should it be based on the quantity and quality of labor. Because Godwin believed that people's labor ability would not be equal, the ideal distribution system should implement the principle of "distribution according to need." Godwin firmly believed that his ideal society was a hundred times higher than the real society in which he lived, and he believed that he should spare no sacrifice and pain, and even take violent revolution to realize it. Nevertheless, Godwin was not a communist. He opposed large-scale machine production and opposed social organization of production and consumption. He imagined that there could be a technology that would allow the workers who are now united into a collective to be re-dispersed into individual small producers, thereby returning to individual small-scale production.

　　Because there are many brilliant factors in Godwin's thought, he has also been respected and valued by scientific communists. One of the characteristics of his work is that it runs through a passionate humanitarian spirit from beginning to end. There is no dry preaching. His writing style is commendable.

　　The great French Utopian Socialist Fourier (1772-1837) in the 19th century is a well-known thinker of socialist pioneers. His theory not only runs through a profound analysis and sharp criticism of the capitalist system, but also contains a genius insight into the future society. Marxist classic writers have a very high evaluation of his theory and thought, and also criticized his utopian social and political views.

　　"Selected Works of Fourier" is compiled by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Fourier's main works have been selected. The Chinese translation is translated from the Russian text. The whole book has four volumes. Volumes 1 and 2 collect Fourier's three works "The Destiny of the World and Mankind," "Criticism of the Civilization System," and "The Road to the Future," and some excerpts from "Theory of Four Movements." Volumes 3 and 4 collect the book "The New World" and the two articles "Economic and Scientific Anarchy" and "Declaration of the New World."

　　The immature theories of Utopian Socialists adapt to the immature capitalist relations. Their socialist theories have both genius predictions and mysterious illusions. They criticize capitalism, curse it, and dream of eliminating it, but they can never discover the essence and development laws of capitalism, and they cannot find the social forces to create a new society. With the development of class struggle in capitalist society, their theories even hindered the workers' movement. Therefore, "the significance of critical utopian socialism and communism is inversely proportional to the historical development process" ("Communist Manifesto"). However, as Engels said: "Although its theory contains very mysterious and very utopian nature, it is still the greatest sage from ancient times to the present and a thinker who brilliantly predicted the countless truths that we now prove to be correct by scientific methods" ("Preface to the Book German Peasant War"). Therefore, if we treat the works of Utopian Socialists historically, we can still get a lot of useful inspiration.

　　From Thomas More's "Utopia" to Thompson and Whitling's works on the eve of the birth of Marxism, there are no less than dozens of Western European Utopian Socialist works. In addition to the above four, our country has translated and published "Utopia," "Code of the Community" (Dessamy), "A New View of Society" (Owen), and "The Persecution of Labor and Its Remedy" (John Bray) and other books. The Commercial Press is currently translating the remaining volumes of the two works "Testament" and "Selected Works of Fourier." In addition, it is also translating Campanella's "The City of the Sun," Morelly's "Code of Nature," and selections of Mably, Saint-Simon, Owen and others. These works will be published successively from the end of this year to the first half of next year. In order to help readers understand the life and theories of these authors, the editorial department of The Commercial Press has written prefaces or translated research papers by Soviet scholars for each book.

　　商务印书馆最近出版
    空想社会主义者四种学术名著
    以翻译、出版外国古今学术名著为主要任务的商务印书馆，最近出版了西欧空想社会主义著作四种：“傅立叶选集”第一、二卷（全书共四卷）、弗兰西斯·培根的“新大西岛”、让·梅叶的“遗书”第一卷（全书共三卷）和威廉·葛德文的“论财产”。除“新大西岛”在解放前已有过译本，这次是重新翻译了的外，其余都是第一次译成中文。译文质量较好。
    “新大西岛”是近代英国唯物主义始祖、伟大的科学家和思想家培根（1561—1626）在晚年所写的一本未完成的著作，在他死后的第二年1627年出版。培根生长在“英国资产阶级革命序幕”的时代，资本主义生产的兴起，促进了自然科学的发展。培根在
  “新大西岛”中所描写的理想社会，把人类对于自然的控制扩展到极度。他的理想计划中所拟制的社会改革方案，反映了当时社会的真实斗争，这就是新兴的资产阶级反对英国专制政体的斗争。
    这部著作在早期乌托邦的作品中占有一个特殊的地位。培根所展示的新科学和新技术，虽然设想是为社会解放和消灭贫困服务的，但实际上，它只是为加强资本的权力服务。这样的理想，只有在我们建设社会主义——共产主义的国家才能真正获得实现。
    “遗书”是十八世纪法国空想社会主义的先驱者、最坚决的无神论者梅叶（1664—1729）所写的一部杰出的著作。这本书在梅叶死后才以手抄本流传出来，1762年伏尔泰把它删节发表，1864年才全部公诸于世。
    梅叶出身于乡村纺织工人的家庭，从教会学校毕业后一直担任神甫。由于他长期在乡村和贫苦农民相处，同情劳动人民的悲惨境遇，认识到宗教只不过是剥削阶级用以压迫人民的工具。他写这部著作，就是为了揭露宗教的迷信、谬论和欺骗。他愤慨地告诉人们应该坚决摒弃对宗教的有害信仰，积极起来进行反剥削、反压迫的斗争。他主张建立一个以财产公有制为基础的新社会——公社联盟；在公社中，人人参加劳动，共同享有劳动成果。梅叶的思想反映了当时劳苦群众、特别是贫农的社会愿望和政治观点。他的社会观带有小资产阶级平均主义的色调。“遗书”不仅是一部空想社会主义的著名著作，而且是战斗无神论的杰出文献。恩格斯和列宁都指示过我们，要把十八世纪的战斗无神论的文献一一翻译过来，将其“广布到民间去”。“遗书”中译本的出版，正是我们在这项工作上的一个开端。
    “论财产”的作者威廉·葛德文（1756—1836），是十八世纪英国的急进作家，他一生从事文学活动，主要作品是小说，此外也写过一些政论和历史著作。“论财产”是他在1793年法国大革命时期撰写的一部政论“政治的正义及其对于道德和幸福的影响”中的一篇。在这篇论文中，葛德文从理性原则出发，对私有财产制、特别是资本主义私有制作了尖锐的批判。他指出私有制是一切罪恶的根源，以私有制为基础的社会是暴力和欺骗的社会。为了伸张人类的理性和正义，他要求建立一个没有私有制的理想社会。在这个社会里，分配固然不应该以所有权为依据，也不应该以劳动的数量和质量为依据。因为葛德文认为人的劳动能力不会是均等的，理想的分配制度应该是实行“按需分配”的原则。葛德文坚信他理想的社会比他生活在其中的现实社会要高出百倍，他认为应该不惜一切牺牲和痛苦，甚至采取暴力革命来实现它。尽管如此，葛德文并不是一个共产主义者，他反对大机器生产，反对由社会组织生产和消费，他幻想着可以有一种技术，使现在这些联合成集体的工人重新分散成各别的小生产者，从而返回到个体小生产去。
    由于葛德文的思想中，有许多光辉夺目的因素，所以也受到了科学共产主义者的尊敬和重视。他的作品有一个特色，就是从头至尾都贯穿着热情洋溢的人道主义精神。没有干巴巴的说教。他的文风堪可称道。
    法国十九世纪的伟大空想社会主义者傅立叶（1772—1837），是大家熟知的一位社会主义前驱的思想家。在他的学说中不但贯穿着对于资本主义制度的深刻分析和尖锐批判，而且还包藏着对于未来社会的天才洞见。马克思主义经典作家对他的学说和思想有极高的评价，同时对他的空想的社会政治观点也作过批判。
    “傅立叶选集”是苏联科学院出版社编选的，傅立叶的主要著作都已选入。中译本是从俄文本转译的。全书共四卷。第一、二卷收集了傅立叶的“世界和人类的命运”、“文明制度的批判”、“未来的道路”三部著作和“四种运动论”中若干片断文章。第三、四两卷收集了“新世界”一书和“经济上和科学上的无政府状态”、“新世界宣告书”两篇文章。
    空想社会主义者不成熟的理论适应着不成熟的资本主义关系，他们的社会主义学说，既有天才预测又有玄虚幻想的成份。他们批判资本主义，咒骂它，梦想消灭它，但是他们始终不能发现资本主义的本质和发展规律，他们找不到创造新社会的社会力量，并且随着资本主义社会阶级斗争的发展，他们的学说甚至起了阻碍工人运动的作用。所以说，“批评的空想的社会主义和共产主义的意义是与历史发展进程成反比例的”（“共产党宣言”）。但是，正如恩格斯说的：“虽其学说含有十分虚玄和非常空想的性质，但终究是自古迄今最大智士并英明地预示了现在我们用科学方法证明其正确的无数真理的思想家”。（“德国农民战争一书序言”）因此对于空想社会主义者的著作如果历史地对待它们，仍能得很多的有益的启迪。
    西欧空想社会主义著作从托马斯·莫尔的“乌托邦”到马克思主义诞生前夕的汤普生、惠特林的著作，不下数十种，我国已经翻译、出版的除上述四种外，还有“乌托邦”、“公有法典”（德萨米）、“新社会观”（欧文）和“对劳动的迫害及其救治方案”（约翰·勃雷）等书。商务印书馆目前正在翻译“遗书”和“傅立叶选集”两部著作余下的卷次，另外还在翻译康帕内拉的“太阳城”摩莱里的“自然法典”和马布里、圣西门、欧文等人的选集，这几部著作将在今年年底至明年上半年陆续出版。商务印书馆编辑部为了帮助读者了解这些作者的生平和学说，在各书的前面均分别撰写了序言或译载了苏联学者的研究论文。　（高崧）
