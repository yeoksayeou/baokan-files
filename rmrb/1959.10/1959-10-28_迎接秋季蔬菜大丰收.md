    Welcoming the Autumn Vegetable Harvest

    Frost has fallen, and winter is approaching. The autumn vegetable harvest season has arrived. This year's autumn vegetable production, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, has also, like autumn grain production, shown a great picture of a bumper harvest. From the suburbs of cities to the vast countryside, fields upon fields of vegetable plots are filled with all kinds of abundant vegetables; in the non-staple food stores in towns and cities, on vegetable stalls and carts, are piled up green and red, inexpensive and good-quality vegetables; in the public canteens in the countryside, on people's dining tables, are placed a variety of vegetables. What a beautiful season of vegetable harvest this truly is!
    The current issue is to persevere and strive to complete the arduous tasks of harvesting, processing, and storing autumn vegetables brought about by the bumper autumn vegetable harvest. Completing this task is of great significance. On the one hand, the planting area of vegetables, especially autumn vegetables, this year has been greatly expanded compared with previous years. According to preliminary statistics from eleven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the north, the sowing area of autumn vegetables this year has increased by more than double compared with last year. Due to the increase in water conservancy facilities, the increased application of fertilizers, the promotion of vegetable high-yield experiences, and the overcoming of various natural disasters, the yield per unit area of many vegetable fields has also increased. Therefore, the output of vegetables in many areas this year is historically unprecedented. With such a huge increase in output, the harvesting, processing, and storage work must keep up to avoid losses and ensure a bumper harvest. On the other hand, with the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production over the past year or so, due to the increase in the urban population, the improvement of meals in rural public canteens, and the development of pig raising requiring more vegetables as feed, the demand for vegetables has greatly increased, whether in cities or in the countryside. With such a large increase in the demand for vegetables, it is also necessary to do a good job in harvesting, processing, and storing to ensure the needs of all parties as fully as possible, so that both urban and rural people can improve their meals, increase nutrition, and save a portion of staple food, increasing the grain reserves in the hands of the state and the masses. In short, from whatever aspect, it is necessary to do a good job in the harvesting, processing, and storage of autumn vegetables to achieve both high yield and a bumper harvest.
    According to past experience, the key to harvesting autumn vegetables well is, first, to prevent freezing and rotting before the harvest, and second, to allocate sufficient labor to carry out a concentrated rush harvest. Vegetable stems and leaves are tender and have a high moisture content. If these two tasks are not grasped, great losses will be caused. Therefore, in addition to continuing to organize the masses to do a good job in the late-stage field management of autumn vegetables, all localities must also treat the harvesting of autumn vegetables as a major matter, make arrangements in advance, grasp the timing, mobilize the masses, and rush to harvest in a timely manner. In cities, it is also possible to organize a group of cadres, workers, troops, and street residents to help the people's communes in the suburbs rush to harvest vegetables. Some cities have implemented the method of self-harvesting and self-transporting by consumers, that is, the commercial departments uniformly organize collective catering units such as factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, schools, etc., that consume vegetables, and directly link them with the people's communes or production teams that produce vegetables, so that the collective catering units help the communes or production teams harvest the vegetables and transport them back to their own units for storage and consumption, with the price calculated appropriately lower than the market price. This approach not only mobilizes the labor and transportation capacity of government agencies and enterprises to support vegetable harvesting, easing the tension in labor and transportation capacity during the large harvesting season, but also reduces the links in vegetable allocation and supply, alleviating the burden on consumers. This is a very good method of socialist cooperation. Wherever conditions permit, it is worthy of study and promotion.
    After the autumn vegetables are harvested, what follows is the storage and processing of vegetables, including fresh storage, sun-drying, and pickling. Vegetable production in many areas has differences between peak and off-peak seasons. Summer and autumn are the peak seasons, with a large supply of vegetables and many varieties; winter and spring are the off-peak seasons, with low vegetable yields and low supply. However, people's consumption of vegetables is needed every day, and it is required to be supplied evenly. The way to solve this contradiction, in addition to increasing some solar greenhouses and greenhouses as much as possible and striving to increase the production of some vegetables in winter, according to the current conditions, the most important thing is to supplement the off-peak season with the peak season, so that the off-peak and peak seasons are connected, that is, to do a good job in the processing and storage of autumn vegetables so that the needs of the people can be continuously supplied even in the off-peak season of vegetable production.
    The storage and processing of autumn vegetables is something that everyone is very familiar with, but if preparations are not made in advance, it is easy to miss the opportunity and cause waste. Now the autumn vegetables are stored for a long time, in large quantities, and require a lot of equipment and materials. These are the three major characteristics of autumn vegetable storage. In various places, autumn vegetables are eaten for three or four months or even more than half a year, so the storage time is long. Autumn vegetables occupy a major position in the annual vegetable production, and everyone eats one or two hundred catties or more, so the storage quantity is large. Precisely because of the long time and large quantity, the jars, basins, urns, pots, and wood used for sun-drying, pickling, and cellaring are needed in particularly large quantities. At the same time, pickling, sun-drying, and cellaring vegetables require the arrangement of a considerable amount of labor to cut, wash, transport, and store, and cellared vegetables also need to be arranged for labor to frequently turn them over to avoid rotting. All of this shows that the task of processing and storing autumn vegetables is very heavy, and meticulous preparation and organization must be fully made. The most fundamental way to do a good job in preparation and organization is to rely on the masses and widely mobilize the masses in all aspects. It is not only necessary to mobilize and use the manpower and equipment of vegetable operating departments to engage in processing and storage, but more importantly, it is necessary to mobilize communes, production teams, farmers, government agencies, enterprises, schools, troops, and urban consumers to process and store. Not only should collective canteens process and store, but households and urban residents should also be mobilized to process and store. In this way, the manpower and material resources of all parties can be fully mobilized to store, keep, and process a large number of autumn vegetables well. At present, many places have already carried out this work. For example, after mobilizing the masses in Anshan City, 120,000 people from government agencies, schools, troops, and shops have dried and pickled vegetables, and have now processed more than 500,000 catties of dried vegetables and pickles. The vegetable retail department of Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, processes all the vegetables left over from daily sales, and the consumer units put forward the slogan of "everyone eats vegetables, everyone does it," and some use holidays to organize voluntary labor to rush to build pickle ponds, and now each person has processed an average of about 30 catties of dried vegetables and pickles. Facts have proved that consumers, especially collective consumption units, can store and process a large number of vegetables, which can guarantee their own long-term needs and reduce the difficulties in centralized storage by commercial departments and people's communes, which is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone.
    In order to minimize the loss of stored vegetables and to improve processing efficiency and quality, the masses should be mobilized to carry out technical reforms in a big way. For traditional and folk excellent processing techniques, experience exchanges should be organized and promoted to make the processed vegetables more fresh, delicious, and colorful. Local agricultural and commercial departments should assume the responsibility of technical promotion and technical guidance for autumn vegetable storage and processing.
    Whether it is the harvest, processing, or storage of autumn vegetables, we should pay attention to saving and avoiding waste. The autumn vegetable production in the fourteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the north, only Chinese cabbage, can harvest a total of about 25 billion catties this year. However, in the past years, the loss of cabbage leaves during the harvesting and storage process has accounted for about 20% of the total output. According to this estimate, the loss of only Chinese cabbage this year may reach 5 billion catties. What a huge loss this is. At the same time, it also shows that we can still greatly reduce the losses in the harvesting and storage process as long as we are more careful. Other vegetables also have varying degrees of loss. Therefore, in the process of harvesting, storing, and processing autumn vegetables, all localities should widely carry out publicity on saving vegetables to the masses, educate the members of the people's communes and the sales staff of vegetable stores to cherish vegetables very much, advocate eating coarse and fine food mixed, eat as much as possible what can be eaten, process as much as possible what can be processed, and use what is not suitable for human consumption as feed, and do not throw it away casually. For urban consumers, we should carry out education on saving vegetables and thrifty housekeeping, so that everyone can save vegetables as much as possible.
    The harvesting, processing, and storage of autumn vegetables are related to the market supply in this long period of this winter and next spring, to meeting the needs of the people in life, to saving staple food and increasing feed. This is a matter of great importance and must not be ignored. Now that the harvest season has arrived, the agricultural and commercial departments in various places should immediately take action under the leadership of the Party committee, actively make preparations, so as to be ready to devote themselves to the rush harvesting movement and the processing and storage work at any time. There may be some difficulties in doing this work well, but as long as we continue to implement the spirit of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, and fully mobilize the masses, we will surely be able to truly enjoy this rich fruit after the bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.

    迎接秋季蔬菜大丰收
    霜降已过，立冬将至，秋季蔬菜收获的季节来到了。今年的秋菜生产，在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的号召下，也和秋粮生产一样，出现了一个大丰收的大好景象。从城市郊区到广大农村，在大片大片的菜田里挤满了各种丰硕的菜蔬；在城镇的副食品商店里，在菜摊和菜车上，堆满了碧绿的和鲜红的而且价廉物美的菜蔬；在农村的公共食堂里，在人们的饭桌上，摆上了多种多样的菜蔬。这真是一个多么美好的蔬菜丰收季节啊！
    当前的问题是，再接再厉，努力完成由于秋菜大丰收而带来的繁重的秋菜收获、加工和储存的任务。完成这个任务，有很重要的意义。一方面，今年蔬菜特别是秋菜种植面积比往年扩大了很多。据北方十一个省、市、自治区的初步统计，今年秋菜播种面积，比去年增加一倍以上。由于增加了水利设施，增施了肥料，推广了蔬菜丰产经验，战胜了各种自然灾害，很多菜田的单位面积产量也有了增长。因此，许多地区今年蔬菜的产量之大都是历史上空前的。在产量有了巨大增长的情况下，收获和加工储存工作必须跟上，才不至于造成损失，才能保证丰产丰收。另一方面，随着一年多来工农业生产的继续跃进，由于城市人口的增加，由于农村公共食堂伙食的改善，还由于养猪事业的发展要求更多的蔬菜作饲料，无论城市或农村，对于蔬菜的需要量都大大增加了。在蔬菜需要这样大量增长的情况下，也必须把收获和加工储存工作做好，才能尽可能充分地保证各方面的需要，才能使城乡人民既可以改善伙食，增加营养，又能够节约一部分主食，增加国家和群众手中的粮食储备。总之，无论从哪一方面来说，都必须做好秋菜的收获和加工储存工作，做到丰产而又丰收。
    根据历年来的经验，收好秋菜的关键，一要在临收之前防冻、防烂，二要调配足够的劳力进行突击抢收。蔬菜的茎叶嫩、水分多，如果不抓紧以上两项工作，就会造成很大损失。因此，各地除了应当继续组织群众做好秋菜的后期田间管理以外，还必须把秋菜的收获当作一件大事情来对待，事先作好安排，紧紧掌握时机，发动群众，及时抢收。在城市还可以组织一批干部、职工、部队和街道居民，帮助郊区人民公社抢收蔬菜。有些城市实行了消费者自收自运的办法，就是由商业部门统一组织消费蔬菜的厂矿企业、机关、学校等集体伙食单位和生产蔬菜的人民公社或生产队直接挂钩，由集体伙食单位帮助公社或生产队把蔬菜收获起来，运回自己的单位中去储存和食用，在计算价格时适当低于市场价格。这种做法，不但动员了机关企业劳动力和运输力支援蔬菜收获，缓和了大量收获季节劳动力和运输力紧张的状况，而且减少了蔬菜调运、供应的环节，减轻了消费者的负担。这是一种很好的社会主义协作的办法。凡是有条件的地区，值得加以研究和推广。
    秋菜收获以后，接踵而至的是蔬菜的储存和加工工作，包括鲜藏、晒干和腌制。蔬菜生产在许多地区都有旺季和淡季的差别。夏、秋为旺季，蔬菜上市量大，品种多；冬、春为淡季，蔬菜产量少，上市量也少。但人们对蔬菜的消费，却是天天需要，是要求均衡地供应的。解决这个矛盾的办法，除了尽可能增加一些阳畦和温室，在冬季生产中努力增产一部分蔬菜以外，根据目前的条件，最主要的是要以旺补淡，使淡季旺季衔接，也就是说，要做好秋菜的加工和储存工作，以便在蔬菜生产的淡季，也能够不间断地供应人民的需要。
    秋菜的储存和加工，是大家很熟悉的一件事情，但是，如果事先不做好准备工作，也很容易错过时机，造成浪费。现在秋菜储存的时间长、数量大、需要设备材料多，这是秋菜保管的三大特点。各地秋菜食用时间达到三、四个月甚至半年以上，所以储存的时间长。秋菜在全年蔬菜生产中占主要地位，每个人要食用一、二百斤或者更多，所以储存的数量大。正由于时间长、数量大，因此晒干、腌制、窖藏所用的缸、盆、坛、罐和木料等等也就需要得特别多。同时，腌晒和窖藏蔬菜需要安排相当多的劳动力来切洗、搬运和存放，窖藏的蔬菜还需要安排劳力经常翻倒，避免腐烂。所有这些，都说明秋菜加工储存任务很繁重，必须充分作好细致的准备和组织工作。做好准备和组织工作，最根本的道路是依靠群众，广泛发动各方面的群众。不仅要动员和使用蔬菜经营部门的人力和设备来从事加工储存工作，而且更重要的是要发动公社、生产队、农民、机关、企业、学校、部队和城市消费者进行加工和储存。不仅要集体食堂加工储存，还应当发动农户和城市住户加工和储存。这样，才能充分调动起各方面的人力和物力，把大量秋菜储存好、保管好和加工好。目前许多地方都已经进行了这个工作。例如，鞍山市在发动群众以后，仅机关、学校、部队和商店就有十二万人晒腌蔬菜，到现在已经加工干菜和咸菜五十多万斤。陕西省宝鸡市蔬菜零售部门把每天卖剩的蔬菜全部加工起来，消费单位提出“人人吃菜，人人动手”的口号，有的利用假日组织义务劳动赶修腌菜池，现在平均每人已经加工干菜和咸菜三十斤左右。事实证明，消费者特别是集体消费单位能够把大量蔬菜储存和加工，既可以保证本身长时期的需要，又减少商业部门、人民公社集中保管的困难，是一举两得的好事。
    为了尽量减少储存蔬菜的损耗，为了提高加工效率和加工质量，应该发动群众大搞技术改革。对传统的和民间流传的优良加工技术，应该组织经验交流，加以推广，使加工出来的蔬菜更加鲜嫩味美，丰富多采。各地农业和商业部门，应当担负起秋菜储存和加工的技术推广和技术指导的责任。
    无论秋菜的收获、加工或储存，都应该切实注意节约，避免浪费。北方十四个省、市、自治区的秋菜生产，仅大白菜一项，今年就可以总共收获二百五十亿斤左右。但历年来大白菜在收获和储存过程中，菜叶的脱落损失约占总产量的20％，依此推算，今年仅仅是大白菜一项的损失量就可能达到五十亿斤。这是一个多么巨大的损失。同时这也说明，我们在收获和储存过程中，只要更加细心爱护，可能减少的损失还是很大很大的。其他蔬菜也有程度不同的损耗。因此，各地在收获、储存和加工秋菜过程中，要广泛地向群众进行节约蔬菜的宣传，教育人民公社社员和蔬菜门市部营业人员要十分爱惜蔬菜，提倡粗细混吃，能吃的就尽先吃，能加工的就努力加工，不宜于人吃的就用来作饲料，不要随便扔掉。对于城市消费者，更应该进行节约蔬菜的教育和勤俭持家的教育，使人人都能够尽量节约蔬菜。
    秋菜的收获、加工和储存工作，关系到今冬明春这一长时期市场的供应，关系到满足人民在生活上的需要，关系到节约主食和增加饲料，这是一件关系重大的事情，决不能忽视。现在已届收获季节，各地农业和商业部门应当在党委领导下立即行动起来，积极作好准备，以便随时投入抢收运动和加工储存工作。作好这项工作，可能会遇到一些困难，但是只要继续贯彻反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，充分发动群众，就一定能够在秋菜大丰收以后使我们能够真正享受到这个丰硕的果实。
