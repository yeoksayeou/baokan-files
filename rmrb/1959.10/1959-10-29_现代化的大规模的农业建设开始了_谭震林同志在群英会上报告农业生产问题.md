Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke on the 28th at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade.

    He first said: The 500 million-plus farmers across the country are using practical actions to win the victory of the autumn harvest to express their congratulations to this conference. On behalf of them, I congratulate the conference on its success.

    Tan Zhenlin said: Simultaneously with the victories on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts, our agricultural production front has also achieved great victories this year. Grain crops are expected to increase by about 10%, reaching about 550 billion jin. Cotton production is likely to increase by more than 10%. Crops such as tobacco, hemp, sugar, tea, and oilseeds have all increased compared to last year. Diversified operations have seen the largest increase. The total output value of agricultural and sideline industries has had a greater increase.

    This year's victory was achieved on the basis of overcoming huge natural disasters. This year's disasters, including droughts, floods, wind disasters, and insect pests, were the largest since liberation. The drought centered in Hubei was not recorded in seventy years; the spring rain in Guangdong was also unseen in decades; the floods north of Beijing also exceeded records of several decades; the typhoons centered on the Fuzhou and Xiamen line were as high as level 12 or above, a destructive disaster; the insect pests, especially locusts, that came with the water and drought disasters were also much larger than in previous years. If such disasters had occurred in old China, it would have meant thousands of miles of barren land, no harvest, vast expanses of water, families broken and destroyed, and wives and children scattered. In the great drought in Henan in 1942, three million people starved to death. If it were a drought like this year's, more than ten million people would have disappeared. But such a tragic scene is gone forever in our socialist country. We have overcome the disasters and replaced the tragic scenes of history with beautiful scenes of abundant harvests.

    The countryside is now engaged in the intense "Three Autumns" work of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and at the same time, a large-scale "small autumn harvest" campaign is being carried out, with tens of millions of people going to the mountains, beaches, and riveræ»©s to harvest wild plants, collect wild medicinal materials and wild fruits, with a harvest volume much larger than last year. The water conservancy construction movement has already begun, with more than 30 million people already at work. The winter manure accumulation movement is about to begin, and the winter soil improvement movement is also underway.

    Our country's irrigated area has reached 1.007 billion mu. From the perspective of engineering construction, it has reached about two-thirds, but if we consider the irrigation benefits, there are still many projects to be done. If we want to completely control the harm of floods, there are still more projects to be done, and the amount of soil and water conservation work is still very large. Every winter, we must use tens of millions of manpower to invest in basic water conservancy construction. Soil improvement is also a major measure to increase agricultural production. After improvement, it often doubles the yield per mu. In the past ten years, nearly 200 million mu have been initially improved, and more than 300 million mu have not yet been improved. These cultivated lands are stumbling blocks to increasing crop yields, and their yield per mu is usually 50% or more lower than the average yield. The winter manure accumulation campaign is a key to ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Without fertilizer, there will be no increase in production.

    This winter, a "Five Winters" movement of winter plowing, winter repair, winter improvement, winter accumulation, and winter management will be carried out, which is directly related to agricultural production next year. If most of the spring-sown arable land can be plowed once this winter, not only will the soil structure undergo changes that are conducive to crop growth, but also many pests will be frozen to death, which will reduce pest damage next year. Winter is a great time to build water conservancy projects, which will directly serve winter irrigation and spring watering. Winter is a favorable time to improve the soil; improving one more mu will increase production by one time. Accumulating one more dan of fertilizer in winter will result in one more jin of grain next year. The quality of field management in winter directly affects the summer harvest next year. Whether there are missing seedlings or broken ridges, whether there is excessive growth, and whether there is a lack of water and fertilizer all depend on careful field management.

    Tan Zhenlin said: At present, more than 500 million farmers across the country are working with the greatest determination to do a good job in the "Five Winters" work, and at the same time, they are doing a good job in winter sideline production to ensure that agricultural production next year continues to leap forward and have another bumper harvest, in coordination with the continued leap forward of the entire national economy.

    This year's agricultural production has two new characteristics: one is the large-scale high-yield movement, and the other is to increase the commodity volume of agricultural products. The large-scale high-yield production developed on the basis of the satellite field movement in 1958. This is a very meaningful phenomenon. It is a key for us to rapidly increase the total output of agricultural products. It can harvest two to three mu of agricultural products on one mu of cultivated land. For example, this year the average yield of ginned cotton per mu is only fifty-seven or eight jin, but the high-yield cotton in large areas yields one hundred and fifty to two hundred jin of ginned cotton per mu. The amount of commodity that agricultural products can provide is an important condition for the development of the entire national economy. The larger the commodity volume of agricultural products, the faster the development of the entire national economy. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, the commodity rate of agricultural products was not high, and this situation could not meet the requirements of the great leap forward of the entire national economy. The large-scale development of industrial production, the increase in urban employees, and the large number of rural laborers entering cities, and the expansion of the industrial, transportation, and capital construction teams all require more agricultural products, more supplies of grain, oil, meat, fresh fish, chickens, ducks, eggs, vegetables, and fruits, and more supplies of cotton, tobacco leaves, hemp, sugar crops, tea, and silk. If the commodity volume of these products cannot be rapidly increased, even if the total output increases, it will still drag down the entire national economic leap forward. The establishment of people's communes has begun to solve this problem. This year is the first production year of people's communes, and it has begun to show its increasingly great role in the high-speed development of the entire national economy. Improving the commodity rate of agricultural products and increasing the commodity volume of agricultural products is one of the central tasks of people's communes at present and in the future. At present, people's communes across the country are focusing on rapidly completing the state's purchase tasks and further increasing the commodity rate of agricultural products as the main criteria for checking their production achievements. Striving to do a good job in production, greatly increasing the commodity rate of agricultural products, and supporting the construction of the entire national economy in order to rapidly build our country into a strong socialist country, this is the feeling of more than 500 million farmers, and this feeling is the gift of the farmer comrades to the conference.

    Next, Tan Zhenlin profoundly analyzed the superiority of the people's communes. He said: Since the establishment of people's communes across the country, not one has collapsed. After rectification, they are consolidating and developing soundly. People's communes have demonstrated their far superior advantages over agricultural production cooperatives in last year's Great Leap Forward, in the deep plowing work, in the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, in the mass steel-making movement, in this year's struggle to overcome natural disasters, in running commune industries, and in improving the commodity rate of agricultural products. Last year's deep plowing and this year's struggle to overcome natural disasters are two important conditions for the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, and the achievements of these two tasks were obtained on the basis of great collaboration; during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, sixteen large-scale reservoirs were built, and in the first year of people's communes, thirty-three large-scale reservoirs were built. Only eleven large-scale reservoirs were built before the end of 1957. From the comparison of this quantity, we can see the superiority of people's communes; the total industrial output value of people's communes reached 7 billion yuan from January to June, and it may reach more than 10 billion yuan by the end of the year. This would not be possible if it were not for the people's communes. Last year's mass steel-making movement was an important key to the high-speed development of our entire national economy. Tens of millions of people in rural areas went to the mountains, regardless of commune boundaries, township boundaries, county boundaries, and even breaking through provincial boundaries, and demonstrated a high degree of communist style, writing a glorious page in our country's history. These are the direct reasons for the birth of our country's people's communes.

    Tan Zhenlin emphasized that the emergence of people's communes is the result of China's political and economic development. He said: As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, agricultural production organizations in the form of plowing teams and work exchange groups appeared. During the Anti-Japanese War, more mutual aid teams appeared. By 1953, mutual aid teams had generally developed, and by the summer and autumn of 1955, cooperativization formed a climax. In 1956, advanced cooperatives were completed, and in 1958, people's communes were realized. From plowing teams, work exchange groups, and mutual aid teams to cooperatives and people's communes, this process of organizing and developing production from low to high levels is the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, the process of transitioning from individual agricultural economy to collective agricultural economy, and also the process of developing from small collective agricultural economy to large collective agricultural economy.

    Tan Zhenlin pointed out that the development process of people's communes is also the struggle process of two roads in rural areas. Then he emphatically pointed out: Comrade Mao Zedong has always been the commander and leader of this struggle. He said that from the Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan in 1926, he has been constantly fighting to clear the way for building a socialist countryside, from summarizing the experience of plowing teams and work exchange groups to discussing organization and issues of agricultural cooperativization, etc., making profound elaborations in politics, ideology, and policies. On the one hand, he guided the continued progress and development of the movement, and on the other hand, he sharply and severely launched a fierce struggle against the ideas and people who yearned for the capitalist road. This struggle is linked to our country's entire socialist revolution and socialist construction and is a major component of the entire socialist revolution.

    Tan Zhenlin finally said: Now it should be said that the road to socialist construction in rural areas has been basically cleared, and a modern, large-scale agricultural construction has begun. Our agricultural economy will normally maintain a leap forward pace in this construction process. Here, I would like to ask the advanced producer comrades attending the meeting to make greater efforts to provide more and better agricultural machinery for our country's agricultural modernization and to provide more and stronger technical talents with modern scientific knowledge. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The high-speed development of agriculture will greatly promote the high-speed development of the entire national economy. Without the support of strong technical equipment, it is unimaginable for agriculture to develop at a greater speed. Now is the time for us to raise this issue, and it is also the time for us to emphasize this issue. I believe that all the heroes attending the meeting, and the worker brothers and sisters across the country, will do their best to support the development of agriculture and will meet the requirements of the 500 million-plus farmer brothers.
