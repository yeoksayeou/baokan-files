Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke on the 28th at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade.

    He first said: The 500 million-plus farmers across the country are using practical actions to win the victory of the autumn harvest to express their congratulations to this conference. On behalf of them, I congratulate the conference on its success.

    Tan Zhenlin said: Simultaneously with the victories on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts, our agricultural production front has also achieved great victories this year. Grain crops are expected to increase by about 10%, reaching about 550 billion jin. Cotton production is likely to increase by more than 10%. Crops such as tobacco, hemp, sugar, tea, and oilseeds have all increased compared to last year. Diversified operations have seen the largest increase. The total output value of agricultural and sideline industries has had a greater increase.

    This year's victory was achieved on the basis of overcoming huge natural disasters. This year's disasters, including droughts, floods, wind disasters, and insect pests, were the largest since liberation. The drought centered in Hubei was not recorded in seventy years; the spring rain in Guangdong was also unseen in decades; the floods north of Beijing also exceeded records of several decades; the typhoons centered on the Fuzhou and Xiamen line were as high as level 12 or above, a destructive disaster; the insect pests, especially locusts, that came with the water and drought disasters were also much larger than in previous years. If such disasters had occurred in old China, it would have meant thousands of miles of barren land, no harvest, vast expanses of water, families broken and destroyed, and wives and children scattered. In the great drought in Henan in 1942, three million people starved to death. If it were a drought like this year's, more than ten million people would have disappeared. But such a tragic scene is gone forever in our socialist country. We have overcome the disasters and replaced the tragic scenes of history with beautiful scenes of abundant harvests.

    The countryside is now engaged in the intense "Three Autumns" work of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and at the same time, a large-scale "small autumn harvest" campaign is being carried out, with tens of millions of people going to the mountains, beaches, and river滩s to harvest wild plants, collect wild medicinal materials and wild fruits, with a harvest volume much larger than last year. The water conservancy construction movement has already begun, with more than 30 million people already at work. The winter manure accumulation movement is about to begin, and the winter soil improvement movement is also underway.

    Our country's irrigated area has reached 1.007 billion mu. From the perspective of engineering construction, it has reached about two-thirds, but if we consider the irrigation benefits, there are still many projects to be done. If we want to completely control the harm of floods, there are still more projects to be done, and the amount of soil and water conservation work is still very large. Every winter, we must use tens of millions of manpower to invest in basic water conservancy construction. Soil improvement is also a major measure to increase agricultural production. After improvement, it often doubles the yield per mu. In the past ten years, nearly 200 million mu have been initially improved, and more than 300 million mu have not yet been improved. These cultivated lands are stumbling blocks to increasing crop yields, and their yield per mu is usually 50% or more lower than the average yield. The winter manure accumulation campaign is a key to ensuring the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Without fertilizer, there will be no increase in production.

    This winter, a "Five Winters" movement of winter plowing, winter repair, winter improvement, winter accumulation, and winter management will be carried out, which is directly related to agricultural production next year. If most of the spring-sown arable land can be plowed once this winter, not only will the soil structure undergo changes that are conducive to crop growth, but also many pests will be frozen to death, which will reduce pest damage next year. Winter is a great time to build water conservancy projects, which will directly serve winter irrigation and spring watering. Winter is a favorable time to improve the soil; improving one more mu will increase production by one time. Accumulating one more dan of fertilizer in winter will result in one more jin of grain next year. The quality of field management in winter directly affects the summer harvest next year. Whether there are missing seedlings or broken ridges, whether there is excessive growth, and whether there is a lack of water and fertilizer all depend on careful field management.

    Tan Zhenlin said: At present, more than 500 million farmers across the country are working with the greatest determination to do a good job in the "Five Winters" work, and at the same time, they are doing a good job in winter sideline production to ensure that agricultural production next year continues to leap forward and have another bumper harvest, in coordination with the continued leap forward of the entire national economy.

    This year's agricultural production has two new characteristics: one is the large-scale high-yield movement, and the other is to increase the commodity volume of agricultural products. The large-scale high-yield production developed on the basis of the satellite field movement in 1958. This is a very meaningful phenomenon. It is a key for us to rapidly increase the total output of agricultural products. It can harvest two to three mu of agricultural products on one mu of cultivated land. For example, this year the average yield of ginned cotton per mu is only fifty-seven or eight jin, but the high-yield cotton in large areas yields one hundred and fifty to two hundred jin of ginned cotton per mu. The amount of commodity that agricultural products can provide is an important condition for the development of the entire national economy. The larger the commodity volume of agricultural products, the faster the development of the entire national economy. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, the commodity rate of agricultural products was not high, and this situation could not meet the requirements of the great leap forward of the entire national economy. The large-scale development of industrial production, the increase in urban employees, and the large number of rural laborers entering cities, and the expansion of the industrial, transportation, and capital construction teams all require more agricultural products, more supplies of grain, oil, meat, fresh fish, chickens, ducks, eggs, vegetables, and fruits, and more supplies of cotton, tobacco leaves, hemp, sugar crops, tea, and silk. If the commodity volume of these products cannot be rapidly increased, even if the total output increases, it will still drag down the entire national economic leap forward. The establishment of people's communes has begun to solve this problem. This year is the first production year of people's communes, and it has begun to show its increasingly great role in the high-speed development of the entire national economy. Improving the commodity rate of agricultural products and increasing the commodity volume of agricultural products is one of the central tasks of people's communes at present and in the future. At present, people's communes across the country are focusing on rapidly completing the state's purchase tasks and further increasing the commodity rate of agricultural products as the main criteria for checking their production achievements. Striving to do a good job in production, greatly increasing the commodity rate of agricultural products, and supporting the construction of the entire national economy in order to rapidly build our country into a strong socialist country, this is the feeling of more than 500 million farmers, and this feeling is the gift of the farmer comrades to the conference.

    Next, Tan Zhenlin profoundly analyzed the superiority of the people's communes. He said: Since the establishment of people's communes across the country, not one has collapsed. After rectification, they are consolidating and developing soundly. People's communes have demonstrated their far superior advantages over agricultural production cooperatives in last year's Great Leap Forward, in the deep plowing work, in the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, in the mass steel-making movement, in this year's struggle to overcome natural disasters, in running commune industries, and in improving the commodity rate of agricultural products. Last year's deep plowing and this year's struggle to overcome natural disasters are two important conditions for the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, and the achievements of these two tasks were obtained on the basis of great collaboration; during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, sixteen large-scale reservoirs were built, and in the first year of people's communes, thirty-three large-scale reservoirs were built. Only eleven large-scale reservoirs were built before the end of 1957. From the comparison of this quantity, we can see the superiority of people's communes; the total industrial output value of people's communes reached 7 billion yuan from January to June, and it may reach more than 10 billion yuan by the end of the year. This would not be possible if it were not for the people's communes. Last year's mass steel-making movement was an important key to the high-speed development of our entire national economy. Tens of millions of people in rural areas went to the mountains, regardless of commune boundaries, township boundaries, county boundaries, and even breaking through provincial boundaries, and demonstrated a high degree of communist style, writing a glorious page in our country's history. These are the direct reasons for the birth of our country's people's communes.

    Tan Zhenlin emphasized that the emergence of people's communes is the result of China's political and economic development. He said: As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, agricultural production organizations in the form of plowing teams and work exchange groups appeared. During the Anti-Japanese War, more mutual aid teams appeared. By 1953, mutual aid teams had generally developed, and by the summer and autumn of 1955, cooperativization formed a climax. In 1956, advanced cooperatives were completed, and in 1958, people's communes were realized. From plowing teams, work exchange groups, and mutual aid teams to cooperatives and people's communes, this process of organizing and developing production from low to high levels is the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, the process of transitioning from individual agricultural economy to collective agricultural economy, and also the process of developing from small collective agricultural economy to large collective agricultural economy.

    Tan Zhenlin pointed out that the development process of people's communes is also the struggle process of two roads in rural areas. Then he emphatically pointed out: Comrade Mao Zedong has always been the commander and leader of this struggle. He said that from the Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan in 1926, he has been constantly fighting to clear the way for building a socialist countryside, from summarizing the experience of plowing teams and work exchange groups to discussing organization and issues of agricultural cooperativization, etc., making profound elaborations in politics, ideology, and policies. On the one hand, he guided the continued progress and development of the movement, and on the other hand, he sharply and severely launched a fierce struggle against the ideas and people who yearned for the capitalist road. This struggle is linked to our country's entire socialist revolution and socialist construction and is a major component of the entire socialist revolution.

    Tan Zhenlin finally said: Now it should be said that the road to socialist construction in rural areas has been basically cleared, and a modern, large-scale agricultural construction has begun. Our agricultural economy will normally maintain a leap forward pace in this construction process. Here, I would like to ask the advanced producer comrades attending the meeting to make greater efforts to provide more and better agricultural machinery for our country's agricultural modernization and to provide more and stronger technical talents with modern scientific knowledge. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The high-speed development of agriculture will greatly promote the high-speed development of the entire national economy. Without the support of strong technical equipment, it is unimaginable for agriculture to develop at a greater speed. Now is the time for us to raise this issue, and it is also the time for us to emphasize this issue. I believe that all the heroes attending the meeting, and the worker brothers and sisters across the country, will do their best to support the development of agriculture and will meet the requirements of the 500 million-plus farmer brothers.

    现代化的大规模的农业建设开始了
    谭震林同志在群英会上报告农业生产问题
    新华社28日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理谭震林28日在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上讲话。
    他首先说：全国五亿几千万农民都正在以夺取三秋大战胜利的实际行动来对这次大会表示祝贺，我代表他们这种心情祝贺大会成功。
    谭震林说：和工业、交通、基建、财贸战线上的胜利同时，今年我国农业生产战线也获得了巨大的胜利。粮食作物预计可能增产10％左右，即达到五千五百亿斤左右。棉花增产可能超过10％。烟、麻、糖、茶、油料等等作物都比去年增产。多种经营的增产幅度最大。农副业总产值有更大的增长。
    今年的胜利，是在战胜巨大自然灾害的基础上取得的。今年的灾害，包括旱灾、涝灾、风灾、虫灾，是解放以来最大的一次灾害。以湖北为中心的旱灾是七十年来找不到记录的；广东春雨也是几十年来没有过的；北京以北的水灾同样是超过了几十年的记录；以福州、厦门一线为中心的台风大到十二级以上，这是一种带有毁灭性的灾害；随着水旱灾害而来的虫灾特别是蝗虫也比往年大得多。如果在旧中国碰到这样的灾害，那就是赤地千里，颗粒无收，一片汪洋，家破人亡，妻离子散。河南在1942年的大旱中饿死三百万人，如果是今年这样的大旱，一千多万人就会不见了。但是这种惨象在我们这个社会主义国家里已经一去不复返了。我们战胜了灾害，用丰收的美景代替了历史上的惨象。
    现在农村正在进行紧张的秋收秋耕秋种的三秋工作，同时开展了一个规模宏大的“小秋收”运动，成千万人上山岗、下海滩河滩，收获野生植物，采集野生药材、野生果品，收获量比去年多得多。兴修水利运动已在展开，已经上工的达到了三千多万人。冬季积肥运动即将开始，冬季土壤改良运动也正在开展。
    我国水利灌溉面积已达到十亿零七千万亩，从工程建设来说，已达到三分之二左右，如果从发挥灌溉效益来说，就还有很多工程要作。如果要从全部控制洪水危害来说，就还有更多的工程要作，水土保持工作量也还很大。每年冬季，我们都必须使用几千万人力投入兴修水利的基本建设。土壤改良工作同样是农业增产的一项重大的措施，经过改良后，往往是成倍地提高亩产量，十年来已初步改良了近二亿亩，还有三亿多亩尚未改良，这些耕地是提高农作物产量的绊脚石，它的亩产量通常低于平均产量的50％到50％以上。冬季积肥运动更是保证农业生产继续跃进的一个关键，没有肥料，就没有增产。
    今年冬季要开展一个冬耕、冬修、冬改、冬积、冬管的“五冬”运动，这是直接关系到明年农业生产的。如果我们大部分春播耕地都能在今年冬季耕翻一遍，不仅土壤结构会发生有利于作物生长的变化，而且许多害虫也就被冻死，这就减轻了明年的虫害。冬季是兴修水利的大好时期，它将直接为冬灌春浇服务。冬季是改良土壤的有利时期，多改一亩，这一亩就会多增产一倍。冬季多积一担肥，明年就多收一斤粮。冬季田间管理的好坏，是直接影响明年夏季收成的，是否存在缺苗断垅，是否发生徒长，是否缺水缺肥，都有赖于细心的田间管理。
    谭震林说：目前，全国五亿多农民正在以最大决心作好“五冬”工作，同时作好冬季副业生产，保证明年的农业生产以继续跃进的步伐，再来一个大丰收，配合着整个国民经济继续跃进。
    今年的农业生产有两个新的特点：一个是大面积的高额丰产运动，另一个是提高农产品的商品量。大面积高额丰产是在1958年卫星田运动的基础上发展起来的，这是一个十分有意义的现象，它是我们迅速提高农产品总产量的一个关键，它能够在一亩耕地上收获二亩到三亩的农产品。例如今年的棉花平均亩产皮棉只有五十七、八斤，但大面积的丰产棉花，亩产皮棉就有一百五十斤到二百斤。农产品能够提供多大的商品量，是整个国民经济发展的一个重要条件，农产品商品量愈大，整个国民经济发展就愈快。在农业合作社时期，农产品的商品率是不高的，这种情况不能适应整个国民经济大跃进的要求。工业生产大发展，城市就业人员的增加，农村大量的劳动力进入城市，工业、交通、基本建设的队伍的扩大，都要求更多的农产品的供应，要求有更多的粮食、油料、肉类、鲜鱼、鸡、鸭、蛋品、蔬菜、水果的供应，要求有更多的棉花、烟叶、麻类、糖料、茶叶、蚕丝的供应。如果这些产品的商品量不能迅速提高，即使总产量增长了，它还会拖着整个国民经济大跃进的后腿。人民公社的建立已经开始解决这个问题，今年是人民公社化第一个生产年度，就开始显示出它在整个国民经济高速度发展中起着日益巨大的作用。提高农产品的商品率，增加农产品的商品量，是人民公社当前的和今后的中心工作之一。目前全国各地的人民公社，都在围绕着迅速完成国家的收购任务，更多的提高农产品的商品率，作为检查自己生产成就的主要标准。努力搞好生产，大大提高农产品的商品率，支援整个国民经济的建设，以便迅速地把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家，这就是五亿多农民的心情，这个心情也就是农民同志们向大会的献礼。
    接着，谭震林深刻地分析了人民公社的优越性。他说：全国的人民公社建立以来，没有垮掉一个，经过整顿后，正在巩固地、健全地向前发展。人民公社在去年大跃进中，在深耕工件中，在修建大型水利工程中，在大办钢铁运动中，在今年克服自然灾害的斗争中，在兴办公社工业中，在提高农产品商品率的工作中，都表现出远远优越于农业生产合作社。去年的深耕和今年克服自然灾害的斗争，是今年农业生产仍然能够继续跃进的两个重要条件，这两个工作的成就，都是在大协作的基础上得到的；大跃进的1958年兴修了十六座大型水库，人民公社化的第一年兴修了三十三座大型水库，1957年底以前只修建十一座大型水库，从这个数量的比较上就可以看出人民公社化的优越性；人民公社的工业总产值，1至6月份已达到七十亿元，到达年底可能有一百多亿元。如果不是人民公社化，这是不可能的。去年大办钢铁运动是我国整个国民经济能够高速度发展一个重要关键。农村几千万人上山，不分社界、乡界、县界、甚至突破了省界，发挥了高度的共产主义风格，在我国历史上写上了光荣的一页。这些，就是我国人民公社出生的直接原因。
    谭震林强调指出人民公社的产生是我国政治经济发展的结果。他说：远在第二次国内战争时期就出现耕田队、变工组等形式的农业生产组合，在抗日战争期间就有更多的互助组出现，到了1953年互助组已经普遍的发展起来，到了1955年夏秋之间合作化形成了高潮，1956年完成了高级合作社，1958年实现了人民公社化。从耕田队、变工组、互助组到合作社、人民公社，这个由低级到高级组织起来发展生产的过程，就是农业社会主义改造的过程，就是由个体的农业经济过渡到集体的农业经济的发展过程，也是由小集体农业经济发展成为大集体农业经济的发展过程。
    谭震林指出人民公社的发展过程也就是农村两条道路的斗争过程。接着他又着重指出：毛泽东同志始终是这个斗争的统帅和领袖。他说，从1926年的湖南农民运动考察报告开始，他就一直不停的为着建设社会主义农村扫清道路进行不断地斗争，从总结耕田队、变工组的经验到论组织起来、关于农业合作化问题等等，在政治上、思想上，在方针、政策上都作了深刻的阐明。一方面指导运动的继续前进，继续发展，另方面尖锐地严厉地向那些向往资本主义道路的思想、人物展开了激烈的斗争。这个斗争是和我国整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设相联系的，是整个社会主义革命的主要组成部分。
    谭震林最后说：现在应当说农村社会主义建设的道路已经基本上扫清了，一个现代化的大规模的农业建设已经开始了，我国农业经济将在这个建设过程中，正常地保持着跃进的步伐前进。我在这里向到会的先进生产者同志提出要求同志们以更大的努力，为我国农业现代化提供更多更好的农业机械，提供更多更强的具有现代科学知识的技术人材。农业是国民经济的基础，农业高速度地发展会大大地促进整个国民经济高速度发展。没有强大技术装备的支援，农业更大速度地发展是不可想像的。现在是我们提出这个问题的时候了，也是我们必须强调这个问题的时候了。我相信全体到会英雄们，全国的工人弟兄姊妹们是会以全力来支援农业的发展的，是会满足五亿几千万农民兄弟的要求的。
