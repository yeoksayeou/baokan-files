　　Tangier
    Tangier is located in the northwest corner of Africa and is an important seaport of Morocco, with an area of approximately 583 square kilometers. It has a population of 120,000, including approximately 25,000 Europeans and 10,000 Jews.
    In 1923, France, Britain, and Spain concluded the "Paris Convention," and Tangier was jointly administered by these three countries. In November 1952, Tangier became an international city controlled by eight Western countries: the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, and Spain.
    The Moroccan people have always opposed foreign control of Tangier. After Morocco's independence in March 1956, it demanded the return of Tangier, but this demand was rejected by the Western countries. It was not until the nine-nation conference held in Fedala, Morocco, in October 1956 that an agreement was reached. According to this agreement, the eight countries agreed to transfer administrative, legislative, and judicial institutions from their control to Morocco. However, the financial system remained unchanged.
    The Moroccan government promulgated the "Tangier Charter" in August 1957. The charter stipulates the maintenance of freedom of trade. (Shan)

　　丹吉尔
    丹吉尔在非洲的西北角，是摩洛哥的一个重要海港，面积约有五百八十三平方公里。居民有十二万，其中约有二万五千名欧洲人，一万名犹太人。
    1923年，法、英、西三国订立“巴黎公约”，丹吉尔由这三国共管。1952年11月，丹吉尔成为美、英、法、比、荷、葡、意、西等八个西方国家控制的国际城市。
    摩洛哥人民一直反对外国控制丹吉尔。摩洛哥在1956年3月独立以后，要求归还丹吉尔，但是这个要求遭到西方国家的拒绝。直到1956年10月，在摩洛哥菲达拉举行的九国会议上才达成了一项协议。根据这项协议，八国同意把行政、立法和司法机构从八国手中移交给摩洛哥。但是财经系统仍保持不动。
    摩洛哥政府在1957年8月颁布了“丹吉尔宪章”。宪章规定维护贸易往来的自由。　（珊）
