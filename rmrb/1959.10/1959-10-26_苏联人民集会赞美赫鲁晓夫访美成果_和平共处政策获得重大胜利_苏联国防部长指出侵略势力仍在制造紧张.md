Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, rallies have been held in many cities and villages across the Soviet Union in recent days to discuss the results of Khrushchev's visit to the United States. The Soviet working people warmly support Khrushchev's visit to the United States, calling it a great visit of peace and friendship.

    Zolotikh, a veteran worker at the "Cutter" factory in Moscow, said at a general meeting of all employees that we believe Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States is a great contribution to easing international tensions. As a result of this visit, the international situation has warmed up, and the supporters of the "Cold War" have been dealt a blow.

    At a general meeting of all employees in the assembly workshop of the United Machine Factory in Tula, a suburb of Moscow, fitter Vasily Popov emphasized in his speech that Khrushchev's visit to the United States is a major event not only in the lives of the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also in the lives of all mankind, because it is an outstanding contribution to consolidating universal peace.

    Many enterprises in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, held mass rallies. At a meeting of employees of the locomotive and rolling stock repair factory, speakers pointed out that the Soviet Union's disarmament plan marks the victory of human reason over the forces of war.

    The Lugan Locomotive Factory in Ukraine held a rally of thousands of people. Steelworker Voloshin said at the meeting that the American people now know the true situation of our peace-loving motherland. All progressive mankind welcomes Khrushchev's words: The time has come to melt the stockpiled weapons in open-hearth furnaces.

    Representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union also adopted many resolutions at various meetings, large and small, all of which emphasized the historical significance of Khrushchev's visit to the United States in further easing tensions in international relations, eliminating the "Cold War," and improving Soviet-U.S. relations.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 24th, Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union Malinovsky, said that Khrushchev's visit to the United States has created a realistic possibility to improve Soviet-U.S. relations, eliminate the "Cold War," and ensure international peace.

    Marshal Malinovsky made a report on the results of Khrushchev's visit to the United States at a meeting of activists of the Soviet Ministry of Defense in Moscow on the 23rd.

    Marshal Malinovsky said that the Soviet people and the soldiers of the Army and Navy unanimously endorse the results of this visit and sincerely thank Khrushchev for his tireless work for the happiness of mankind.

    Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that one cannot fail to consider that there are influential aggressive forces in the world, which are trying by all means to maintain or even exacerbate international tensions and do not want to remove bases on foreign territories.

    Malinovsky said that precisely because of this, the Soviet people are fighting to eliminate the "Cold War" and consolidate peace, concerned about strengthening the defense capabilities of the Soviet state, and maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces, in order to resolutely and thoroughly defeat any enemy who dares to invade the Soviet Union.

    Attendees expressed their support for the government's peaceful foreign policy in a letter to the CPSU Central Committee, which was unanimously adopted.

    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在苏联许多城市和乡村中，连日来纷纷举行集会，讨论赫鲁晓夫访问美国的成果。苏联劳动人民热烈拥护赫鲁晓夫访问美国，并称这次访问是伟大的和平与友好的访问。
    莫斯科“铣刀”工厂老工人佐洛蒂赫在全体职工大会上说，我们认为赫鲁晓夫对美国的历史性访问是对缓和国际紧张局势的一个极大贡献。由于这次访问，国际局势转暖，“冷战”拥护者遭到了打击。
    在莫斯科郊区图拉城联合机工厂装配车间全体职工会议上，钳工瓦西里·波波夫在讲话中强调指出，赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问不仅在苏联和美国两国人民的生活中，而且在全人类的生活中都是一桩大事件，因为它是对巩固普遍和平的杰出贡献。
    格鲁吉亚首都第比利斯的许多企业都举行了群众大会。在机车机辆修理厂职工会议上，讲话的人指出，苏联关于裁军问题的方案标志着人类理智对战争势力的胜利。
    乌克兰鲁干机车制造厂举行了数千人的大会。炼钢工人沃洛申在会上讲话说，美国的老百姓现在知道了我们这个爱好和平的祖国的真实情况。全体进步人类都欢迎赫鲁晓夫所说的这样的话：把储备起来的武器放在马丁炉里熔化掉的时候已经到了。
    苏联各界代表在各种大小会议上还通过了许多决议，这些决议都着重指出了赫鲁晓夫访美一事对进一步缓和国际关系中的紧张局势、消除“冷战”、改善苏美两国关系的历史意义。
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基说，赫鲁晓夫的访问美国，创造了现实的可能来改善苏美关系，消除“冷战”和保障国际和平。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅23日在莫斯科苏联国防部积极分子大会上作了关于赫鲁晓夫访问美国成果的报告。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，苏联人民、陆海军军人一致赞同这次访问的成果，衷心感谢赫鲁晓夫为人类幸福而进行的孜孜不倦的工作。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，不能不考虑世界上存在着有影响的侵略势力，这种势力正在用一切手段来企图维持甚至加剧国际紧张局势，不想撤除在别国领土上的基地。
    马利诺夫斯基说，正因为如此，苏联人民为消除“冷战”和巩固和平而斗争，关心加强苏维埃国家的国防力量，保持武装部队的战斗准备，以便坚决彻底地击溃胆敢进犯苏联的任何敌人。
    到会者在一致通过的致苏共中央的信中表示拥护政府的和平外交政策。
