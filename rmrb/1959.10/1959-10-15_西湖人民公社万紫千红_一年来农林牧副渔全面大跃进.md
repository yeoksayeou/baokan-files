　　West Lake People's Commune: Myriad Purples and Thousands of Reds
　　All-round Leap Forward in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations and Fishery in the Past Year
　　(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th dispatch) Since the establishment of the West Lake People's Commune in Hangzhou City a year ago, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fishery have all made a great leap forward, and the lives of the commune members have greatly improved.
　　The total output of spring grain in the West Lake Commune this year increased by 66% compared with last year, and the output of rapeseed doubled. The total output of early rice also increased by 25% compared with last year. The famous Longjing tea, both at home and abroad, has an average yield of 123.9 jin of dried tea per mu in spring and summer alone, and the total output increased by 30.8% compared with last year. The actual income of commune members increased by about 40% compared with last year.
　　The natural conditions of the West Lake Commune are suitable for the all-round development of production, but before communization, agricultural cooperatives were difficult to develop comprehensively due to their small organizational scale and business scope. After the establishment of the commune, according to the different characteristics of each production team, the content of key production of each production team was determined. For example, the tea area focuses on tea production and also develops animal husbandry and mountain forest fruit tree production; the semi-mountainous area implements grain and tea simultaneously, and comprehensively develops animal husbandry, vegetables, spices and other production items; production teams with more paddy fields take grain as the key link and develop diversified operations at the same time. Comprehensive arrangements have also been made for the labor force, with leaders dividing up the work and the labor force specializing in different industries. 85% of the labor force is engaged in grain and tea production; the remaining labor force is engaged in diversified operations.
　　In the West Lake tea area, the problem of severe labor shortages during the spring and summer tea picking seasons has not been solved for a long time. In the past, it was generally necessary to hire more than 100,000 temporary tea pickers every year. However, this year, after communization, the total tea output increased by more than 30%, but the number of tea pickers hired from outside this year decreased by more than 50,000 compared with last year. What is the reason? Because the commune established public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, freeing more than 1,600 women laborers from tedious housework and putting them into production. Also because the commune has strong funds, it has purchased new agricultural machinery and transportation equipment, such as the number of tea kneading machines increased from 42 to 56, and 37 electric motors were purchased to replace the original manual operation with electric operation, which saved a lot of manpower.
　　The commune's animal husbandry has developed greatly in just one year. The average number of pigs raised per household is more than five, and the number of poultry has more than doubled compared with the same period last year. The commune has established 38 large-scale livestock farms. In order to closely integrate agriculture and animal husbandry, the commune has established 24 large-scale livestock farms on tea mountains. The commune has also developed 227 dairy cows and dairy goats, and released a large number of fish.
　　In terms of mountain forest fruit and wood production, in addition to planning to close mountains for afforestation and protecting and developing scenic forest trees, the commune invested more than 40,000 yuan to plant nearly 500 mu of various fruit and wood gardens, with a total of more than 600,000 plants; more than 200 mu of spice crops such as osmanthus, rose, spearmint, and geranium were planted, which beautified, greened, and scented the beautiful West Lake, and increased the income of commune members.
　　The commune-run industry has also embarked on a path of consolidation and development after rectification. The agricultural tool machinery factory produced more than 18,000 pieces of large and small agricultural tools in the first half of the year. During the busy farming season, the factory workers went to the villages to repair and assemble agricultural tools, which strongly supported agricultural production.
　　With the continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of commune members has been rapidly improved. The commune has established hospitals and schools, all children are enrolled in school, and each production team has wired broadcasting, clubs, and libraries, and some even have amateur theater troupes and sports fields. This year, the commune allocated 80,000 yuan from the collective welfare fund to build new "farmers' villages" in five teams including Lingyin. On the eve of the National Day, more than 200 commune members moved into bright and spacious new houses.

　　西湖人民公社万紫千红
    一年来农林牧副渔全面大跃进
    本报杭州14日电　杭州市西湖人民公社成立一年来，农林牧副渔全面大跃进，社员生活大大改善。
    西湖公社今年春花粮食总产量比去年增加66％，油菜籽的产量翻了一番。早稻总产量也比去年增加25％。闻名国内外的龙井茶叶，仅春、夏两季平均亩产干茶就达一百二十三斤九两，总产量比去年增加30.8％。社员实际收入比去年增加40％左右。
    西湖公社自然条件适于全面发展生产，但在公社化以前，农业社由于组织规模、经营范围较小，很难综合发展。公社成立后，根据各个生产队的不同特点，确定各个生产队重点生产的内容，如茶区就以茶为主，同时发展畜牧和山林果木生产；半山区就实行粮、茶并举，全面发展畜牧、蔬菜、香料等项生产；水田较多的生产队就以粮为纲，同时发展多种经营。对劳力也作了全面安排，实行领导分工、劳力分业，占85％的劳力从事粮、茶生产；其他的劳动力从事多种经营。
    西湖茶区，每年春夏茶采制时期，劳动力奇缺的问题是长期没有解决的。历年来，一般每年要雇临时采茶工十万多工。而公社化后的今年，茶叶总产量增加三成以上，但是今年聘请外来的采茶工却比去年减少五万多工。原因在哪里呢？因为公社兴办了公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿班，使一千六百多个妇女劳动力，从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，投入了生产。也因为公社资金雄厚，购买了新式的农业机械和运输工具，如茶叶揉捻机从四十二架增加到五十六架，买了电动马达三十七台，用电动操作代替原来的手工操作，这样就节省了大量的人力。
    全社的畜牧业，在短短的一年中，得到很大发展。猪的饲养量平均每户达五头多，家禽比去年同期增加一倍多。全社已建立了大型畜牧场三十八个，为使农业和畜牧业紧密结合，公社把二十四个大型畜牧场建立在茶山上。全社还发展了奶牛、奶羊二百二十七只，放养了大量的鱼。
    在山林果木生产方面，公社除了有计划地封山育林、保护和发展风景林木以外，投资四万多元，种植各种果木园近五百亩，共六十多万株；种植桂花、玫瑰、留兰香、天竺香等香料作物二百多亩，既美化、绿化、香化了美丽的西湖，又增加社员的收入。
    社办工业，经过整顿，也走上了巩固发展的道路。农具机械厂上半年就生产出大小农具一万八千多件，农忙时节，厂里工人就下村去修配农具，有力地支援了农业生产。
    随着生产的不断发展，社员的物质和文化生活迅速得到提高。公社办起了医院、学校，儿童全部入了学，各个生产队都有有线广播、俱乐部、图书室，有的还有业余剧团和运动场。今年，公社从集体福利基金中拨出八万元，在灵隐等五个队新建了“农民新村”，国庆前夕，二百多户社员搬进了明亮、宽敞的新宅。
