    The Reality of Details
    The movie "The Song of Youth" is a good film. Probably because people love to watch it, it's easy to pick on small flaws.
    I'm thinking of two small shots that have issues with "small props."
    One is when Lin Daojing is reading Gorky's "Mother" borrowed from Lu Jiachuan. The white cover has Gorky's woodcut portrait in the upper right corner. This kind of binding was the first edition of Kaiming Bookstore in 1936. When Lin Daojing reads it in the film, such a version didn't exist yet.
    The other is in the countryside of Ding County. When Teacher Zhao receives a magazine, he glances at the cover, looking from left to right, but very few magazines at that time were printed horizontally. If Teacher Zhao were holding a progressive publication from that time, it would better illustrate the characteristics of the era and the personality of the character.
    Although they are details, I would like to bring them up for the reference of comrades in the film industry.

    细节的真实
    电影“青春之歌”是一部好影片。大概正因为人们很爱看它，也就容易挑小毛病了。
    我想到有两个小镜头，是属于“小道具”上的问题。
    一处是林道静在看从卢嘉川处借来的高尔基的“母”，白色封面的右上方是高尔基的木刻像，这种装帧的版本，是开明书店一九三六年初版。影片里林道静读它的时候，当时还没有这样的版本。
    另一处是在定县乡下，赵老师收到一本杂志时，他把封面看了一眼，是从左看到右的，但当时的杂志，很少有横排的。如果在这儿赵老师手里拿的是一本当时的进步刊物，那就更有助于说明时代特征和人物的性格了。
    虽是细节，但我也愿意提出来，供电影界同志参考。
