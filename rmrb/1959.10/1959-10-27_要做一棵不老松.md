To Be an Evergreen Pine
Luó Dōng, Director of the Food and Sundries Warehouse, Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

I am seventy-one years old this year. I joined the Red Seventh Army as a soldier in 1929. Before participating in the revolution, I wasted forty-one years. When I was seven years old, my father died because he had no money for medical treatment. Only my mother and my two brothers were left in the family. Because we had no land, we could only rely on my mother to work, and the family's life was unsustainable. I had to take my three-year-old brother to beg for food. At the age of seventeen, I worked as a long-term laborer in a landlord's house, often not having enough to eat and being beaten and scolded. In 1929, my mother passed away, and my younger brother also went to work for others. In order to escape the oppression of the landlord, I went to Baise County and joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—the Red Seventh Army. From the first day I joined the revolution, the Party educated me and cared for me like a mother. In 1937, we crossed the Yellow River to North China to resist Japan. At that time, the division commander Comrade Yang Chengwu saw that I was old and asked me to pay more attention to my health and assigned me to do logistics work. In 1945, the leaders advised me to rest. But when the motherland was not completely liberated, how could I not work? Wouldn't that betray the Party's education and cultivation of me?

In 1949, the whole country was liberated. In order to take care of my old age and frailty, in 1950, the Party transferred me from the army to the Yulin Trading Company's branch as director in my hometown of Guangxi. After twenty-one years of combat life as a rough soldier, it was not a simple matter to transfer to the commercial front to learn how to do business. Of course, there were many difficulties, and I was determined to learn everything from scratch. Being already sixty years old, starting from scratch again, I also felt it was very difficult, but I was not intimidated by the difficulties. At first, I was not familiar with the grades and prices of the goods and could not keep the accounts. So I put a box behind each kind of goods and put the money earned from sales into these boxes separately. At night, I took the money out to count and asked other comrades to help me record the accounts according to the types of goods. I couldn't use an abacus. When I rested at night, I would ask the comrades "for jins and taels" to learn abacus and bookkeeping. In less than a year and a half, I learned how to use the abacus and keep simple accounts. In 1953, I entered the workers' spare-time school held by the county trade union to study. In two years, thanks to the patient teaching of the teachers and the enthusiastic help of the comrades, I mastered simple arithmetic operations, recognized more than a thousand characters, and basically reached the level of elementary school. Now I have a higher elementary school education level, and I can read articles in newspapers and general documents, and I can also write some simple articles and folk songs. I have subscribed to a copy of the Guangxi Daily for a long time. If there is important news or instructions from the Party, I also introduce them to the comrades.

When I first arrived at the Yulin Trading Company's branch, the young comrades who had just joined the revolution felt very strange, and many comrades talked about me behind my back. Some said that I was a veteran cadre of the Long March and should be a director of something. Some said that I had been working for the revolution for so many years, and I was old, so I should enjoy the fruits of the revolution! Once, a comrade surnamed Huang asked me: "Comrade Luo, you are a veteran cadre, you have really worked hard and made great contributions, why don't you become an official?" I was really a little angry when I heard this, but I thought that this was a new comrade who had just joined the revolution, so I couldn't blame him. I solemnly told him: "Comrade, you are wrong. We who are engaged in the revolution are all servants of the people. We are not here to become officials. Can you underestimate the matter of selling oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar? This is also a glorious thing to serve the people!"

In 1955, the organization transferred me to the food and sundries warehouse as director, half-recuperating and half-working. But I can't stay idle. Every day, as soon as it dawns, I get up to check the goods, dry the goods, and clean the warehouse. Whenever there is a gale and heavy rain in the middle of the night, I always get up to check every corner of the warehouse. During the Great Leap Forward last year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country made a flying leap forward, and of course I was unwilling to lag behind. In order to create a "four-no" warehouse, I led the workers to work hard day and night, drying and transporting goods, cleaning the environment, and tidying up the warehouse all day long in the hot sun. But to achieve "four-no," it is not enough to rely on hard work alone, but also to think of clever ways. For example, the day lily in the warehouse, the past preservation method was to dry it frequently, once every half month, each time requiring more than ten temporary workers, costing forty workdays, and an annual expenditure of four hundred and eighty yuan, which was very uneconomical. I worked with the warehouse staff to use some old wooden boards to make several sealed warehouses, and the day lily was placed inside, which only needed to be dried once to be stored for a year, saving expenses. In addition, for a large pile of goods that are easily damp and infested with insects, such as biscuits, dried bean curd, and brown sugar, I also studied with the comrades based on the principle of sealed warehouses and created sealed storage methods for biscuits, etc., to achieve product safety. I work in the warehouse the same way as the young people. Sometimes the leaders don't want me to work, and the comrades also want me to rest more, but I have a strange temper. I feel uncomfortable if I don't work for a day. If I don't work during the day, I can't sleep at night. I have to work to the end, and I won't feel at ease if I don't complete the task.

I cherish all goods, big and small, and I pick up even small commodities such as sesame seeds and soybeans. All packaging materials, big and small, even a nail, I collect. Some packaging materials are broken and I repair them. If they can't be repaired, such as burlap bags, I use them to cover the goods. Once, I found that some fertilizer was still attached to the empty fertilizer bags. I picked up two burlap bags and shook and swept them. One yielded half a jin, and the other yielded twelve liang. I thought that if all the fertilizer bags were shaken and swept clean, wouldn't it be a huge amount? From then on, whenever I had time, I would shake and sweep the empty burlap bags clean one by one, and I also motivated the workers to do the same. In this way, in just two years, we recovered several thousand jins of fertilizer for the country. In 1953, when I bought goods, I found that the raw oil bought was all packed in large barrels. When retailing to customers, no matter how hard you try, the remaining oil at the bottom could never be completely poured out. Later, I thought of a way to tie a clean white towel to one end of a stick, put it into the oil barrel to absorb the raw oil, wring it into a small bucket, and put it in the sun to dry, and pour out the clear layer to sell. In two years, using this method, I produced more than 10,000 jins of accumulated oil. In June of this year, I was hospitalized due to illness. Seeing that it was raining every day, I thought that the goods in the warehouse might be moldy. I felt more uncomfortable living in the hospital for a day than for a year. Before I was completely healed, I resolutely requested to be discharged from the hospital and return to the warehouse to take care of the goods, so that there was no mold in the warehouse goods.

I am living a very good life now. My monthly income, in addition to supporting two nephews to go to school, has a surplus. I respond to the Party's call to increase production and practice economy with practical actions of thrift and diligence in managing the family, and I deposit the surplus money in the bank. Since my hometown was collectivized into a people's commune, the life has been greatly improved compared to before. My younger brother, cousins, sister-in-law, nephews, nieces-in-law, and grand-nephews are all living a carefree and happy life. If it were not for the Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people to achieve the victory of the revolution, how would we have today? Thinking of these, I feel younger and younger, and looking forward to the future, our future is even more brilliant, which is really exciting! "It is rare to live to seventy since ancient times." I am already over seventy years old, but I still refuse to admit that I am old. I want to cherish my twilight years even more, and I want to be an evergreen pine, and contribute my meager remaining strength to the Party and the country, and make greater achievements to counter the slanders and attacks of domestic and foreign hostile elements and right-leaning opportunists against our country's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

    要做一棵不老松
    广西僮族自治区玉林县食杂仓库主任　罗东
    我今年七十一岁了，1929年参加红七军当战士，未参加革命前虚度了四十一年。我七岁的时候，父亲无钱医病死去，家里只剩下母亲和我两兄弟。因为无田无地，只靠母亲做活，一家生活无法维持，我只好带着三岁的弟弟讨饭。十七岁的时候，我到地主家打长工，经常吃不饱，还要挨打受骂。1929年，我母亲去世了，弟弟也给人家打工去了。我为了挣脱地主的压迫，走到了百色县，参加了中国工农红军——红七军。从参加革命的第一天起，党就像亲娘一样教育着我，关怀着我。1937年，我们跨渡黄河到华北抗日，当时分区司令员杨成武同志见我年纪大，要我多注意身体，并分配我搞后勤工作。1945年，领导上又劝我休息。但在祖国尚未完全解放的时候，我怎能不工作呢？这样岂不辜负了党对我的教导和培养吗？
    1949年全国解放了，为了照顾我年老体弱，1950年党让我从部队转业到家乡广西玉林贸易公司门市部当主任。经过了二十一年战斗生活的大老粗，一旦转入商业战线学做买卖，这可不是一件简单事。困难当然很多，我下决心，一切从头学起。年纪已经六十来岁了，再从头学起，自己也感到很不容易，但我没有被困难所吓倒。起初不熟悉商品的等级和牌价，记不上账，我就在每种商品的背后放上一个盒子，把卖得来的钱分别投入这些盒子里，晚上把钱掏出来数，请别的同志帮助按商品种类记上账。我不会打算盘，晚上休息时，我就向同志们“问斤求两”，学珠算，学记账。不到一年半的工夫，就学会了打算盘和记简单的账。1953年我进了县工会举办的职工业余学校学习，两年中，由于教师的耐心教学和同志们的热心帮助，使我掌握了简单算术运算，认识了一千多字，基本上达到了初小程度，现在已经有高小文化程度，报纸上的文章和一般文件也都可以阅读了，并能写些简单的文章和山歌。我长期订了一份广西日报，有重要新闻或党的指示，我还向同志们介绍。
    我初到玉林贸易公司门市部，那些新参加革命的年轻同志都觉得很奇怪，许多同志在背后议论我。有的说我是长征老干部，应该当上一个什么长才合适。有的说我干了革命这么多年，年纪老了，应该坐享革命福啦！有一次一个姓黄的同志问我：“罗同志，你是一个老干部，真是劳苦功高，为什么不当个什么官？”我当时听了真有点冒火，但我一想，这是一个刚参加革命的新同志，不好责怪。我严肃的告诉他：“同志你错了，我们干革命的，都是人民的勤务员，我们不是为当官而来的。你能小看卖油盐酱醋的事吗？这也是为人民服务的光荣事情啊！”
    1955年组织上调我到食杂仓库当主任，半休养半工作。但我总闲不住，我每天天一亮，就起床检查商品，翻晒商品，打扫仓库。遇到半夜里刮风下大雨，我总要起床检查仓库的每一个角落。去年大跃进中，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下向前飞跃迈进，我当然也不愿落后。为了搞“四无”仓库，我带领职工日夜苦战，整天在炎热的阳光下翻晒、搬运商品，打扫环境卫生，整理仓库。但是要实现“四无”，单靠人勤还不行，还要想点巧办法。如仓库里的黄花菜，过去保管方法是经常翻晒，每半月一次，每次要请十多名临时工，一次要四十个劳动日，全年要支出四百八十元，这样非常不合算。我就和仓库职工一起利用一些旧木板，做成了几个密封仓，黄花菜放在里面，只需翻晒一次即可保管一年，节约了支出。另外对饼干、腐竹、黄糖等一大堆容易潮湿虫蛀的商品，我都根据密封仓的原理，与同志们研究，又创造了饼干等密封保管办法，达到了商品安全化。我在仓库也和年轻人一样的干。有时领导要我不干，同志们也要我多休息，可是我有一个怪脾性，我一天不干活，就一天不舒服，白天不干活，晚上就睡不着觉，干活要干到底，不完成任务心里也不安宁。
    我对大大小小的商品都很爱惜，连芝麻、黄豆等小商品我也颗粒拾起来。所有大小包装用品，那怕是一只钉子，我都收集起来，有些包装用品破了就补，补到不能再补如麻包等，就拿来盖商品。有一回我发现装化肥的空麻包里还沾着一些化肥，我拣起两个麻包来抖抖扫扫，一个得半斤，一个得十二两。我想如果把所有的化肥包都抖扫干净，不就是一个巨大的数目吗？从此一有空就一个个的把空麻包抖扫净，还带动了职工也这样做，这样仅在两年内，就为国家收回了几千斤化肥。1953年，我买商品发现买进来的生油都是用大桶装着，零售给顾客，卖到最后，剩下的油尾怎么也倒不净，后来想了一个办法，把一条干净的白毛巾缚在棍子的一头，伸入油桶去把生油吸出来，拧到一个小桶里，拿到日光下晒，把清净的那一层倒出来卖，两年当中用这个办法，搞出来一万多斤积油。今年6月，我生病住在医院，看到天天下雨，想起仓库里的商品可能发霉，我住在医院一天比一年还难受，病还未全部好，我便坚决要求出院回仓库保管商品，使仓库商品没有任何霉变情况。
    我现在生活得很好，每月收入除负担两个侄子入学外，都有节余。我以勤俭持家的实际行动响应党的增产节约号召，余钱都存入银行。老家在人民公社化以后，生活比以前有了更大的改善，我的弟弟、堂弟、弟媳、侄儿、侄媳、侄孙都过着无忧无虑的幸福生活。如果不是党和毛主席领导中国人民取得革命的胜利，我们那会有今天呢？想到这些，我就感到越活越年轻，展望未来，我们的前途更是光芒万丈，真是令人激奋不已！“人生七十古来稀”，我已经是七十开外的人了，但是我仍不服老，要更加珍惜我的晚年的时光，要做一棵不老松，好好地为党为国家贡献出我的一点微薄的余力，做出更大的成绩来反击国内外敌对分子、右倾机会主义分子对我国总路线、大跃进、人民公社的诬蔑和攻击。
