    On the Cotton Procurement Front
    Jiangsu Exceeds September in October
    The people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, selling new cotton, have realized the bold promise of "October exceeding September, actual results exceeding targets." In the first and middle ten days of October, the communes across the province exceeded the state's monthly new cotton procurement plan by more than 40%, with the average daily sales volume more than double that of September. Now, commercial departments in various places are continuing their efforts to purchase, striving to double the monthly procurement volume compared to the plan.
    Xinjiang Hastens to Harvest Frost-Resistant Cotton
    The 2,265,000 mu of cotton in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has entered the flourishing period of silver blossoms like the sea. Full of joy of harvest, members of the communes are picking, loading, and transporting day and night, selling to the state. Commercial departments are also adding personnel and establishing more purchasing points, improving purchasing methods, and vigorously purchasing. The current purchasing volume has greatly exceeded the same period last year.
    This year, the boll-opening period of cotton in Xinjiang is early, and the frost period is late, so pre-frost cotton can reach more than 80%. Under the slogan of picking more pre-frost cotton, picking less post-frost cotton, and eliminating peach-picking, the work of picking and gleaning cotton is progressing rapidly. Now, the first picking has been completed, and the second picking and gleaning are underway.
    Hebei Seizes Short Fiber Production
    In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, after the new cotton is stored in warehouses, the method of simultaneously grasping ginning and delinting is adopted. While processing cotton, they vigorously grasp the production of short fiber. As of October 16, a total of more than 22,900 dan of short fiber have been processed, an increase of more than six times compared with the same period last year.
    Cotton short fiber has a wide range of uses. It can be spun into coarse yarn, woven into flannel shirts and trousers, and beautifully patterned flannel. It can also be made into medicinal cotton, clothing wadding, rayon, and artificial wool. It is also an important chemical raw material, which can be used to make artificial glass, photographic film, spray paint, transparent paper, etc.

    在棉花收购战线上
    江苏十月超九月
    江苏省各产棉区人民公社出售新棉，实现了“10月超9月，实绩超指标”的豪迈诺言。10月上、中两旬，全省各公社超额40％以上完成了全月国家新棉收购计划，每天的平均售棉量比9月份增加两倍。现在各地商业部门正在继续努力收购，争取全月的收购量比计划翻一番。
    新疆赶收霜前花
    新疆维吾尔自治区的二百二十六万五千亩棉花，已进入银花如海的盛开期。各公社社员正满怀丰收喜悦，日夜采摘装运，出售给国家，商业部门也添人设点，改进收购方法，大力收购，目前的收购量已大大超过去年同期。
    今年新疆的棉花吐絮期早，降霜期迟，霜前花可达80％以上；在多摘霜前花，少摘霜后花，消灭剥桃花的口号下，全区的摘花拾花工作进展很快，现在，头遍花已经摘完，正摘、拾二遍花。
    河北大抓短绒生产
    河北省邯郸专区，在新棉入库后，采取轧花和脱绒一齐抓的方法，在加工棉花的同时，大抓短绒生产，到10月16日止，共加工了短绒二万二千九百多担，比去年同期增加六倍多。
    棉花短绒用途很广，可以纺粗纱，织成绒衣绒裤和图案美丽的绒布，还能制成药用棉、衣服絮棉、人造丝、人造毛；它又是重要的化工原料，能制人造玻璃、照像用胶卷、喷漆、透明纸等。
