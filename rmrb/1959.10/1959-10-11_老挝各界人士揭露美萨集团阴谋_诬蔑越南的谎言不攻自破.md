Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th -- According to a report from "Lao Patriotic News" on the 6th, the Lao Patriotic Front's Sam Neua Provincial Committee recently received many letters and protest letters from people from all walks of life, accusing the U.S.-Sananikone group of despicable acts of grabbing ordinary people to use as prisoners and handing them over to the United Nations' "Investigation Subcommittee" on the Lao situation for interrogation.

A letter written on September 29 by the people of a village in Khoune District stated, "When Phoui Sananikone's troops were carrying out 'mopping-up' operations in Khoune and Muong Ai, they arrested ten people from this village and said they would take them to Sam Neua to hand them over to the United Nations' 'Investigation Subcommittee.'"

A letter from someone in Samteu District said that he was arrested on September 20 and later escaped from Sam Neua. He said, "I was detained in Sam Neua together with fifty people from Khoune, Samteu, Houamuang, Muongxoi, and other districts, including children aged fourteen or fifteen. The personnel of the 'Civic Affairs' (Note: a kind of Lao special agent organization) made us participate in 'study' every day. They said that when the United Nations' 'Investigation Subcommittee' came to interrogate us, we had to confess that we had been trained by the Viet Minh and had attacked the Lao fighting forces in Khoune and Muong Ai strongholds, otherwise we would be hanged and killed."

A person named Tao Bun said in a letter, "We did not see any Vietnamese troops or artillery at all. All we saw in Sam Neua were American planes and Sananikone troops wearing American uniforms and carrying American weapons. That's how I answered those foreigners who asked me."

"Lao Patriotic News" said that the above facts shattered the slanderous arguments of the Phoui Sananikone group against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　老挝各界人士揭露美萨集团阴谋
    诬蔑越南的谎言不攻自破
    新华社河内9日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”6日报道，老挝爱国战线党桑怒省委员会最近收到各界人民的许多来信和抗议书，控诉美国—萨纳尼空集团卑鄙地把老百姓抓去充当俘虏交给联合国的老挝局势“调查小组委员会”审讯。
    川库县一个村庄的人民在9月29日写的一封信中说，“培·萨纳尼空军队在川库和芒艾进行‘扫荡’的时候，把这个村里的十个人抓去，并且说要把他们带到桑怒交给联合国的‘调查小组委员会’。”
    桑德县一个人来的信说，他在9月20日被抓，后来从桑怒逃出来。他说，“我和川库、桑德、霍芒、芒水等县的五十个人一起被关在桑怒，其中有十四、十五岁的孩子。‘公民务’（按：老挝一种特务组织）的人员天天要我们参加‘学习’。他们说，联合国的‘调查小组委员会’来审问时，必须供认是受过越盟的训练和曾经向川库、芒艾据点进攻的寮国战斗部队，不然就要被绞死，被杀光。”
    署名陶本的人在信中说，“我们根本没有看到越南部队和大炮。我们在桑怒所看到的只是美国的飞机，穿着美国服装和带着美国武器的萨纳尼空军队官兵。我是这样回答那些问我的外国人的。”
    “老挝爱国新闻”说，上述事实粉碎了培·萨纳尼空集团对越南民主共和国诬蔑的论调。
