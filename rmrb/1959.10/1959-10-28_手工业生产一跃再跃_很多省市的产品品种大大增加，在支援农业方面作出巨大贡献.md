Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: In recent months, the broad masses of handicraft cooperative members and workers, under the leadership of the local Party committees, have deeply carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy, enabling production to leap forward again and again, resulting in brilliant achievements in the third quarter.

In provinces and autonomous regions such as Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Anhui, Inner Mongolia, and province-level cities such as Tianjin, Changsha, Nanning, Taiyuan, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, and Shijiazhuang, the current variety of handicraft products (including new varieties) has exceeded the original highest level. In Hunan Province, the output of more than 2,900 handicraft products has reached or exceeded the level of the same period last year, accounting for 85% of the total variety. According to statistics from Jinshi, Changde, Xiangxiang, Ningyuan, Shaodong and other counties and cities in the province, the variety of products produced in the third quarter increased by 28.8% compared with the same period last year, and the output increased by 79%. In Anhui Province, by the end of September, the variety of handicraft products had developed from more than 1,400 in June to more than 3,100. In Hohhot, Baotou, Tongliao and other eight regions of Inner Mongolia, the output of felt, leather clothing, leather shoes, leather hats, and hemp ropes in September this year increased by 22% to 45% compared with August last year. The output of stoves and stovepipes increased by one to three times, and the output of clothing, wool sweaters, cloth shoes, felt boots, carts, iron and wooden farm tools also increased by 4% to 16%.

Handicraft departments in various regions attach great importance to the production of tools needed for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing) in agriculture. For example, in Xin Jin, Anshan and other 20 counties and cities in Liaoning Province, by the beginning of September, a total of more than 40 types of tools for harvesting, threshing, threshing, storing, processing, autumn plowing and autumn planting, as well as harnesses for vehicles and horses, totaling more than 1.81 million pieces, accounting for about 50% of the number of tools needed for the "Three Autumns" in agriculture. Handicraft workers in various regions have trial-produced, reformed, and promoted more than one hundred types of new agricultural machinery and tools, such as harvesters, corn threshers, sweet potato slicers, shredded potato machines, peanut threshers, rice threshers, deep plows, and rope traction machines. From July to September, Guizhou Province produced a total of more than 7.71 million iron and bamboo farm tools, 3 million drought-resistant tools, and more than 2,800 vehicles.

The quality of handicraft products has also greatly improved recently, and the cost of products has decreased to some extent.

With the development of production, the amount of handicraft products on the market is increasing day by day. Around National Day, many handicraft products in Shanghai, such as furniture, cookware, daily necessities, women's and children's clothing and accessories, were abundant in supply, meeting the needs of consumers.

At present, under the leadership of the local Party committees, handicraft enterprises in various regions are further opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and deeply carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy with "high output, high quality, low cost, and many varieties" as the center.

    手工业生产一跃再跃
    很多省市的产品品种大大增加，在支援农业方面作出巨大贡献
    据新华社27日讯　近几个月来，广大手工业社员、职工，在当地党委的领导下，深入地开展增产节约运动，使生产一跃再跃，第三季度生产成绩辉煌。
    在河北、吉林、浙江、安徽、内蒙古等省、区和天津、长沙、南宁、太原、福州、郑州、青岛、石家庄等省辖市，现有手工业品种（包括新品种）都已超过原有最高水平。湖南省已有二千九百多种手工业品的产量达到或超过去年同期的水平，占品种总数的85％。据这个省的津市、常德、湘乡、宁远、邵东等县、市的统计，第三季度生产的产品品种比去年同期增长28.8％，产量增长79％。安徽省到9月底，手工业产品品种已由6月份的一千四百余种发展到三千一百余种。内蒙古呼和浩特、包头、通辽等八个地区，今年9月份毛毡、皮衣裤、皮鞋、皮帽、麻绳等比去年8月增产22％到45％，火炉、炉筒增产一倍到三倍，服装、毛衣裤、布鞋、毡靴、大车、铁木农具等也增产4％到16％。
    各地手工业部门很重视生产农业三秋所需要的工具。如辽宁省的新金、鞍山等二十个县、市，到9月初共生产了收割、脱谷、打场、贮藏、加工、秋耕秋种等工具和车马挽具四十多种共一百八十一万余件，约占农业三秋需要工具数量的50％左右。各地手工业工人试制、改革和推广了收割机、包米脱粒机、薯类切片机、切丝机、花生脱粒机、打稻机、深翻犁、绳索牵引机等新式农业机具不下百余种。贵州省7至9月，共生产铁、竹农具七百七十一万余件，抗旱工具三百万件，车辆二千八百余部。
    手工业产品的质量近来也有很大提高，产品成本有所下降。
    随着生产的发展，手工业产品的上市量正日益增多。上海市在国庆节前后，许多手工业产品，如家具、炊具、日用杂品、妇女儿童服装和饰品等货源充沛，满足了消费者需要。
    目前，各地手工业企业正在当地党委领导下，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，深入开展以“高产、优质、低成本、多品种”为中心的增产节约运动。（附图片）
