Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 23rd: The second bridge over the Yangtze River – the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing – has been basically completed more than ten months ahead of schedule. At 5:30 PM on the 22nd, the bridge construction workers erected the last steel beam on the south bank, completing the steel beam assembly task, which was originally planned to take 150 days, 50 days ahead of schedule.

The Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge is a double-track bridge connecting the Chengdu-Chongqing and Sichuan-Guizhou railways, with a total length of 820 meters, consisting of 19 piers reaching tens of meters in height and twelve spans of plate girders, four spans of truss girders, and one span of combined girder. In September of last year, when the bridge construction workers received the task of building the Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge, they were determined to build the bridge quickly, well, and economically. Sure enough, they realized their wish: the bridge, which was originally planned to be completed in two years, was basically completed in just one year and one month, and the quality was very good.

In the construction of the bridge, the Party committee of the bridge has always adhered to the spirit of the General Line, fully relying on the masses. In particular, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call, all bridge construction workers launched a surge of enthusiasm for opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and striving for trains to cross the river in October, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of bridge construction.

    重庆长江大桥基本建成
    据新华社重庆23日电　长江上第二座大桥——重庆白沙沱长江大桥，已经提前十个多月基本建成。22日下午五点三刻，架桥工人把全桥最后一孔钢梁架到了南岸，提前五十天完成了原计划需要一百五十天的钢梁拼装任务。
    白沙沱长江大桥是连接成渝和川黔两条铁路的双线桥，全长八百二十米，有十九个高达几十米的墩台和十二孔钣梁、四孔桁梁、一孔结合梁。去年9月份，当建桥职工接受白沙沱长江大桥修建任务的时候，就下定决心要把大桥又快又好又省地建成。果然，他们实现了自己的愿望：原来打算两年建成的大桥，只花一年零一个多月就基本建成了，而且质量很好。
    大桥党委在大桥修建中，始终坚持贯彻总路线的精神，充分依靠群众。特别是党的八届八中全会号召发出以后，全体建桥职工又掀起了反右倾、鼓干劲，争取10月份让火车过江的竞赛热潮，从而大大加快了建桥进度。（附图片）
