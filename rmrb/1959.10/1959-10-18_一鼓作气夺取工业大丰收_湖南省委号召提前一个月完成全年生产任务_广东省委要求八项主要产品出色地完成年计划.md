　　Hunan Provincial Party Committee Calls for Completing the Annual Production Task One Month Ahead of Schedule

　　Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Requires Excellent Completion of the Annual Plan for Eight Major Products

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Communist Party of Hunan Province issued a battle call to all workers in the province at the industrial secretaries meeting of the city and prefectural party committees held from October 5th to 10th, striving to complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule and making preparations for production in the first quarter of next year.

　　Since August, Hunan Province has been implementing the Central Committee's instructions to oppose rightism, boost morale, and practice increasing production and economizing. A new situation of a comprehensive leap forward has emerged on the industrial and transportation fronts, rapidly reversing the decline in production that occurred in June and July due to the influence of right-leaning thought. Everyone is working with soaring enthusiasm, overfulfilling production plans everywhere. The total industrial output value of the province increased by 18% in August compared to July, and increased by another 20.4% in September compared to August. This excellent situation has created extremely favorable conditions for comprehensively completing and overfulfilling this year's production plan ahead of schedule and for a major leap forward next year.

　　After analyzing the current situation and reviewing the implementation of the three-quarter plan, the meeting unanimously agreed that it is entirely possible to complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule in terms of total industrial output value, output of major products, and general production units. The meeting proposed that the current overall task of the industrial and transportation fronts is to continue to thoroughly implement the struggle against rightism, fight decisively in the fourth quarter, ensure comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of this year's plan ahead of schedule, and create conditions for a greater leap forward next year. The meeting called on the vast number of cadres and workers in the province to continue to leap forward and resolutely complete the above tasks. The meeting made preliminary arrangements for the main production targets for next year.

　　In order to complete this year's tasks ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, the meeting required all localities to tightly grasp the current production, overcome the phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and rushed at the end, and fight a bigger and more beautiful victory on the basis of the complete victory in September. The specific methods are: (1) Deepen the struggle against rightism, boost morale, and launch a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy. The struggle against rightism must be thoroughly implemented to the end, with production as the center, closely combined with production, opposing rightism while boosting morale and engaging in production, so that the two promote each other. At present, special attention should be paid to overcoming the blindly optimistic and complacent mood existing among some cadres, thoroughly eliminating the poison of right-leaning opportunist thought, and continuing to engage in large-scale battles, competitions, and technical innovation and revolution, pushing production to a continuous climax. Special personnel should be responsible for increasing production, supplying, adjusting, and storing raw materials, increasing and conserving electricity, and mass movements for short- and long-distance transportation, and they should be completed within a time limit. It is required to continue to improve management and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. Leading cadres at all levels should insist on participating in labor and integrating with workers.

　　(2) Give top priority to supporting agricultural production. The tools needed for agricultural production should be arranged for production one quarter earlier than in previous years to ensure timely supply. The farm implements, machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides needed for next year's spring plowing should be arranged and produced in the fourth quarter of this year. At present, we must cooperate with the autumn harvest and do a good job in processing agricultural and sideline products. We must arrange steel picks, hoes, explosives, and cement for this winter's water conservancy and railway construction, as well as iron and wood hybrid mechanical tools for excavation, transportation, and tamping that have been identified and can be promoted, in order to improve work efficiency and reduce labor intensity. In order to meet the needs of producing agricultural tools, it is also necessary to appropriately increase the production of some local iron and local steel.

　　(3) In order to prepare for next year's production and ensure that the production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year, in addition to preparing production and capital construction plans for next year (especially the first quarter), we must vigorously develop mine construction. Coal and iron bases that need to be put into production next year are required to clarify resources, complete designs, and prepare for construction before the end of this year. We must use the spare time of farmers to vigorously develop transportation construction. The transportation construction tasks of key factories and mines must be basically completed before February next year. Provide equipment and technical preparations for factories and mines that will undergo technical transformation next year. Strive to put capital construction projects with production tasks in the first quarter and the first half of next year into production ahead of schedule.

　　(4) The meeting required the first secretaries of the municipal and prefectural party committees and the county party committees with more industries to grasp agriculture and industry with one hand. Within the province, conduct a major inspection of the movement to increase production and practice economy, ensuring that leaders go deep into the grassroots, grasp typical examples, hold on-site meetings, summarize and exchange experiences, discover problems, help solve them, and launch a new upsurge in production to complete this year's production plan one month ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, in order to greet 1960 with greater achievements.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Communist Party of Guangdong Province successively held provincial industrial and transportation meetings and telephone conferences of prefectural and county party secretaries on October 8th and 9th, conducting item-by-item research on the eight major products included in the national production plan for the province this year: timber, sugar, salt, steel, iron, coal, rosin, and non-ferrous metals. After analyzing the favorable conditions and unfavorable factors for the production of these eight products before the end of this year, the meeting was determined to continue to boost morale, use favorable conditions, face up to difficulties, and take practical measures, determined to comprehensively complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule. Among them, timber strives to complete the annual plan one month ahead of schedule, steel, iron, and coal to complete the annual plan ten days ahead of schedule, and sugar, salt, and non-ferrous metals to ensure completion of the annual plan before the end of the year.

　　Guangdong's timber, which occupies a certain position in our country, is planned to produce (referring to transportation to traffic lines) 2.2 million cubic meters this year. By the end of September, 1.704 million cubic meters have been completed. Considering that the late rice harvest will begin at the end of October, and some of the commune members who were transferred to cut and transport timber may be transferred back, and the main transportation line for transporting timber in October - inland river shipping - will enter the dry season, but most waterways can still be navigable. As long as the production level in November is not lower than that in September, it is certain to complete the annual production plan of 2.2 million cubic meters of timber one month ahead of schedule.

　　Guangdong's sugar industry, which occupies an important position in our country, has a production task of 500,000 tons this year. Before September, 354,000 tons have been completed. The machine maintenance work to welcome the next pressing season has been basically completed, and pressing can be started in early November. Because many small and medium-sized sugar factories have been built in the province in recent years, especially after the communization, in terms of sugar pressing production capacity and technical level, Guangdong has no problem completing the sugar production task this year.

　　Guangdong's salt making industry, which occupies a certain position in the country, plans to produce 1.02 million tons this year. Due to the particularly heavy rainfall since the summer, the salt making industry has been greatly affected, but after people's day and night struggle, 490,000 tons have been completed by the end of September. The Provincial Party Committee believes that although the salt production task is large, from October onwards, except for Hainan Island, the autumn is high and the air is crisp in various places, and the recent climate is dry, which is conducive to salt field evaporation. It is the best season for salt production. If another batch of small salt fields are developed, it is possible to complete the salt production plan by the end of the year.

　　The steel, iron, and coal projects have a production plan of 40,000 tons, 150,000 tons, and 5.5 million tons respectively in Guangdong Province this year. From January to the end of September, 17,200 tons of steel, 131,000 tons of iron, and 3.345 million tons of coal have been completed. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the production capacity is large, and there are conditions for completing the annual pig iron task ten days ahead of schedule. For coal, we must carry out a mass movement on a large scale. Existing coal mines can produce more, and another batch of small coal kilns can also be built to complete this year's production plan. Although the fuel for steel is more difficult, the Provincial Party Committee believes that it is entirely possible to take other specific measures to strive to complete the annual plan of 40,000 tons of steel ten days ahead of schedule.

　　By the end of September, nearly half of the annual plan for non-ferrous metals has been completed. The Provincial Party Committee believes that as long as there is labor, the mining of non-ferrous metals is not a problem. The Provincial Party Committee has confidence in completing this year's production plan and has taken measures for this purpose. The most difficult is rosin. Guangdong Province plans to produce 35,500 tons of rosin this year, which accounts for about 60% of the national production plan. In the first half of this year, due to insufficient attention from various places and shortcomings in the organization of labor, the average monthly output was only 300 tons. In September, it soared to 4,210 tons. November and December are the off-season for tapping rosin. However, the Communist Party of Guangdong Province, considering the importance of rosin in supporting the whole country, decided to take all measures to strive to complete the annual production plan.

　　一鼓作气夺取工业大丰收
    湖南省委号召提前一个月完成全年生产任务
    广东省委要求八项主要产品出色地完成年计划
    本报讯　力争提前一个月完成全年生产计划，并为明年一季度的生产做好准备工作。这是中共湖南省委在10月5日到10日召开的地市委工业书记会议向全省广大职工发出的战斗号召。
    湖南省自8月上旬贯彻执行中央反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的指示以来，工业、交通战线出现了一个全面大跃进的新形势，迅速扭转了6、7月间由于右倾思想的影响所出现的生产一度下降的局面，人人干劲冲天，处处超额完成生产计划。全省工业总产值8月比7月增长18％，9月又比8月增长了20.4％。这种大好形势，对全面提前和超额完成今年生产计划以及明年的大跃进创造了极为有利的条件。
    会议经过分析当前形势和检查三个季度计划的执行情况，一致认为，在工业总产值方面，主要产品的产量方面，以及一般生产单位方面，提前一个月完成全年生产计划是完全可能的。会议提出，当前工业、交通战线总的任务是：继续深入贯彻反右倾的斗争，决战四季度，保证全面提前和超额完成今年的计划，并为明年更大跃进创造条件。会议号召全省广大干部和职工，继续跃进，坚决完成上述任务。会议对明年的主要生产指标作了初步安排。
    为了提前超额完成今年的任务，会议要求各地紧紧抓住当前的生产，克服前松后紧的现象，在9月的全胜基础上打个更大更漂亮的大胜仗。具体作法是：（一）深入反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起增产节约新高潮。反右倾斗争一定要深入贯彻到底，以生产为中心，紧密结合生产，边反右倾，边鼓干劲，边搞生产，使二者互相促进，互相推动。在目前，特别要注意克服某些干部中存在的盲目乐观和自满松劲情绪，彻底清除右倾机会主义思想的毒素，继续大搞战役，大搞竞赛，大搞技术革新和技术革命，把生产不断推向高潮；对原料、材料的增产、供应、调剂和储备，电力的增产和节约，长短途运输的群众运动等都要有专人负责，限期搞好。要求继续改进管理，注意劳逸结合；各级领导干部要坚持参加劳动，与工人打成一片。
    （二）把支援农业生产提到首要地位。农业生产所需要的工具，要比往年提早一个季度安排生产，保证及时供应。明年春耕生产需要的农具、农械和化肥、农药等，在今年第四季度内就要安排好并进行生产。当前要配合秋收，做好农副产品加工；为今冬修水利和铁路的基建安排好钢钎、锄头、炸药、水泥，以及经过鉴定可以推广的挖、运、夯土等铁木混合机械工具，以提高工效，减轻劳动强度。为了满足生产农具的需要，还需要适当增加一些土铁土钢的生产。
    （三）为了做好明年生产准备工作，保证明年一季度的生产水平不低于今年第四季度，除作好明年（特别是第一季度）的生产基建规划外，要大抓矿山建设。明年需要投入生产的煤、铁基地，要求今年年底以前，查清资源，搞好设计，作好施工准备。要利用农闲空隙大抓交通建设，重点厂矿的交通建设任务，在明年2月以前要基本完成。为明年要进行技术改造的厂矿提供设备和技术准备。明年一季度和上半年有生产任务的基建项目，力争提前投入生产。
    （四）会议要求各地市委和工业较多的县的县委第一书记，当前要一手抓农业，一手抓工业。在全省范围内，开展一次增产节约运动大检查，做到领导深入基层，抓典型，召开现场会，总结交流经验，发现问题，帮助解决，掀起一个提前一月超额完成今年生产计划的生产新高潮，以更大的成就迎接1960年。
    本报讯　中共广东省委10月8日、9日相继召开了全省工业交通会议，地、县委书记电话会议，对全省今年列入国家生产计划的八项主要产品：木材、糖、盐、钢、铁、煤、松香、有色金属进行了逐项研究。会议分析了这八项产品今年年底前生产的有利条件和不利因素后，决心继续鼓足干劲，利用有利条件，正视困难，采取切实措施，决心要全面提前完成全年生产计划。其中，木材力争提前一个月，钢、铁、煤提前十天完成全年计划，糖、盐、有色金属保证年底前完成全年计划。
    在我国占一定位置的广东省木材，今年计划生产（指运到交通线的）二百二十万立方米。到9月底已完成一百七十万零四千立方米。考虑到10月底开始收割晚稻，调来砍伐、运输木材的公社社员可能调回去一些，10月运输木材的主要交通线——内河航运开始进入枯水期，但大多数河道仍然可以航行。只要保证11月份不要低于9月份的生产水平，提前一个月完成全年二百二十万立方米木材的生产计划是有把握的。
    在我国占有重要地位的广东省制糖工业，今年生产任务是五十万吨。9月以前已完成三十五万四千吨。现在迎接下一个榨季的机器维修工作已经基本结束，11月上旬即可开榨。由于近几年特别是在公社化后，全省兴建了许多中小糖厂，按榨糖生产能力和技术水平说，广东今年完成制糖任务是不成问题的。
    在全国占一定位置的广东省制盐工业，今年计划生产一百零二万吨。由于夏季以来，雨量特多，制盐工业受到很大影响，但经过人民日夜奋战，到9月底也完成了四十九万吨。省委认为制盐任务虽大，但10月份起，除海南岛外，各地秋高气爽，近来气候干燥，便于盐田蒸发，正是产盐最好季节。如果再发展一批小盐田，年底完成产盐计划是可能的。
    钢、铁、煤三项，广东省今年的生产计划分别为四万吨、十五万吨、五百五十万吨。1月到9月底止，钢已完成一万七千二百吨、铁完成十三万一千吨、煤已完成三百三十四万五千吨。省委认为生产能力大，提前十天完成全年生铁任务是有条件的。煤要大搞群众运动，已有煤矿还能够多搞一点，再办一批小煤窑，也能完成今年生产计划。钢的燃料虽较困难，省委认为采取别的具体措施，力争提前十天完成年产四万吨钢的计划也是完全可能的。
    有色金属到9月底已完成年度计划的将近一半。省委认为只要有劳力，有色金属开采不成问题，省委有信心完成今年生产计划，为此已采取措施。困难最大的是松香。广东省今年计划生产松香三万五千五百吨，约为全国生产计划数的六成。今年上半年，由于各地重视不够，劳动力组织上有缺点，每月平均生产量仅仅三百吨，9月份猛升到四千二百一十吨，11、12两月是割松香的淡季。但是，中共广东省委考虑到松香支援全国的重要，决定采取一切办法，力争完成全年生产计划。（附图片）
