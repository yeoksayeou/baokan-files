    TASS Reporter Points Out
    Soviet Automatic Station Will Peer at the Far Side of the Moon
    Orbiting the Moon is Much More Difficult Than Landing on It
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: TASS science reporter Yevgeny Bogoyavlensky wrote on the 4th, commenting on the successful launch of the third Soviet cosmic rocket:
    The establishment of an automatic interplanetary station is the fourth remarkable event in the history of conquering the cosmos, following the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, the first artificial solar planet, and the first lunar rocket.
    The Soviet automatic station will orbit the moon and, for the first time, photograph the far side of the moon, which no one has ever seen before. It is entirely reasonable to expect that these unique photographs will be successfully transmitted by automatic radio equipment when the station returns towards Earth. The station's altitude during its orbit of the moon is 10,000 kilometers, which is sufficient to photograph the entire far side of the moon.
    The timing of the lunar orbit was not accidental. From October 2nd to 4th, the moon was closest to Earth (363,000 kilometers).
    The accuracy of the calculations for the lunar orbit far exceeds the accuracy of the calculations for launching lunar rockets. This is because: when landing on the moon, the flight speed could vary within a certain range, causing the rocket's landing time on the moon to be delayed or advanced by about half an hour.
    When orbiting the moon, the calculation of speed must take into account not only the precise time of arrival in the intended area but also the moon's gravity, which must be able to control the rapidly moving rocket, allowing it to orbit the moon and enter the Earth's gravitational field. Figuratively speaking, the moon's gravity in this case will act as a basketball hoop, allowing the rocket flying into space to return to Earth.
    The interplanetary station could also become an Earth satellite, with an unprecedentedly extended orbit. However, this issue is very complex. Some scientists believe that this is entirely possible; the interplanetary station will travel along a very long elliptical orbit. The long axis of this ellipse will reach 400,000 kilometers.
    If the interference of the moon's gravity is ignored, then this satellite could become permanent. Considering the moon's gravity, it can be predicted that the cosmic rocket will become a satellite of both Earth and the moon for a relatively short period (periodically orbiting the moon at each new moon). However, the third cosmic rocket can only become a satellite under the condition that it maintains a certain orbital speed. Otherwise (if the speed drops to zero), the rocket will fly back into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.
    The Soviet scientists' space exploration program is being implemented so rapidly that there is no doubt that in the near future, constant radio communication will be established between the Earth and the Moon. Establishing the first automatic lunar station is now a completely solvable task for Soviet science.

### 塔斯社记者指出  苏联自动站将窥探月宫背面  绕过月球运行比落到月球上困难得多

    塔斯社记者指出
    苏联自动站将窥探月宫背面
    绕过月球运行比落到月球上困难得多
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社科学记者叶夫根尼·鲍戈亚夫连斯基4日在评述苏联成功地发射第三个宇宙火箭时写道：
    建立自动行星际站是在征服宇宙的历史上，继发射第一个人造地球卫星、第一个人造太阳行星和第一个月球火箭之后的第四个卓越的事件。
    苏联自动站将绕过月球运行，并第一次拍摄下任何人还从来没有看到过的月球背面的情况。可以完全有很据地预料，这些独一无二的照片将会在这个站回向地球时由自动无线电仪器顺利地发送出来。这个站在绕过月球运行时的高度是一万公里，这个高度足够用来拍摄月球整个背面情况的照片。
    绕过月球运行的时间的选择并不是偶然的。10月2日到4日，月球距地球最近（三十六万三千公里）。
    绕过月球的飞行轨道计算的准确性，大大超过发射月球火箭时的计算准确性。这是因为：在落到月球的时候，飞行速度可能在某些范围内有变动，以致使火箭落到月球的时间推迟或提早大约半小时。
    在绕过月球飞行时，计算速度不仅要考虑到到达预定地区的准确时间，而且要考虑到月球的吸引力，这种吸引力要能够控制住疾速运行的火箭，使它绕过月球并能进入地球引力场。比喻说，月球引力在这种情况下将起着篮球筐的作用，它要能使飞入宇宙的火箭折回地球。
    行星际站也有可能变成地球卫星，并且有空前延伸的轨道。但是，这个问题是很复杂的。某些科学家认为，这完全可能；行星际站将沿着一个拉得非常长的椭圆形轨道运行。这个椭圆的长轴将达四十万公里。
    如果忽视月球引力的干扰作用，那么这个卫星就可能成为永久性的了。考虑到月球的引力，可以预测，宇宙火箭在一个比较短的时期中，将同时成为地球和月球的卫星，（每当新月时周期性地绕过月球）但是第三个宇宙火箭变成卫星只有在这种情况下才有可能，即如果它保持某种轨道速度。否则（如果速度降低到零），火箭将飞回到地球大气层而焚毁。
    苏联科学家所拟定的宇宙空间研究计划，执行得如此迅速，因而勿庸置疑，最近时期内，在地球和月球之间将建立经常的无线电联系。建立第一个自动月球站，对苏联科学来讲现在已经是完全可以解决的任务了。
