　　What Year Is It?
　　Zhuang Nong
　　I seem to hear a question and answer: A huge voice asks, "What year is it?" A very confident voice answers, "1959!" The huge voice can't help but burst into laughter... The confident tone becomes a little flustered: Isn't it 1959? But the laughter continues.

　　Let's put aside this question and answer for now and look at the following facts: The slogan "Leap into 1960 at high speed" has been enthusiastically echoed by young workers across the country. This slogan vividly embodies the spirit of the General Line, mobilizing the enthusiasm of thousands upon thousands of young workers. The broad masses of young workers are whipping their horses and racing against time to complete this year's industrial production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, rapidly forming a broad mass movement. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen cities in ten provinces, 101,274 young workers and 2,986 youth collectives have already completed this year's workload ahead of schedule and leaped into 1960. Many of them have run even further, and according to the amount of work they have completed, they have entered 1961 and 1962, and even 1974.
                      (People's Daily, October 12)
　　In this way, we see the correct answer to that question and answer: According to the Earth's orbit, it is still 1959; however, according to the progress of the lives of those hundred thousand young workers, it is already 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964…

　　The significance of this question and answer lies here. The Earth will not change its course because of human will, but human life is another matter. In the course of history, people can use their subjective initiative to transcend the conventions of time. In China's thousands of years of history, there have been many changes of dynasties and emperors. Each time a new dynasty was established, the era name was changed to mark the beginning of a new era. However, how many of them truly marked a change of era? Which one can be like us now, with millions of people displaying their talents, bravely crossing time, and jointly accelerating the wheel of history?

　　People and things that "transcend time" have appeared constantly since the founding of our new China. However, such a "large-scale" harvest as today has never been seen before. In just fourteen cities in ten provinces, there are more than 100,000 young workers (middle-aged and elderly workers are not included) striving to transcend time. How many are there in the whole country? This cannot but be said to be a brand-new aspect of the mass movement on the current industrial production front. What is the fundamental reason for this change? Obviously: The soaring flight of more than 100,000 young workers is due to the "east wind" of the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

　　I am reminded of the poem "The sky is high for birds to fly." If birds want to fly high, they must first have a vast sky. If all the birds are trapped in cages, then not a single bird can spread its wings. However, even with a high sky, there are still differences in how high and far birds can fly. The roc spreads its wings for ten thousand miles, while the dung beetle hits the wall after flying three feet. The main reason for this is that their wings are different. Therefore, to fly high, from the perspective of the bird itself, it must first have a pair of strong wings with full feathers. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party cleared the sky for us, dispelled the haze and storms, brought the east wind to help us fly, and created a great situation; now we need everyone to arm their minds, liberate their thinking, exert full effort, and fly high with all their might. We want to transcend time, earlier and earlier. When we hear the question "What year is it?" again, let us answer even louder: Nineteen sixty...!

### 今年何年？

　　今年何年？
　　庄农
　　我仿佛听到了一场问答：一个巨大的声音发问：“今年是何年？”一个非常自信的声音回答：“1959年！”巨大的声音不禁哈哈大笑……自信的声调变得有些慌乱：难道今年不是1959年吗？然而笑声仍不止。
    先按下这场问答，看看下面的事实：“高速度跨进1960年”的口号，已经得到全国青年工人热烈响应。这个口号生动地体现了总路线精神，调动了千千万万青年工人的积极性。广大青年工人为提前和超额完成今年工业生产计划，挥鞭策马，和时间赛跑，迅速形成了一个广泛的群众运动。据十个省十四个市的不完全统计，目前已经有十万一千二百七十四名青年工人、二千九百八十六个青年集体提前完成了今年工作量，飞跃进入了1960年。其中有许多人跑得更远，按其所完成的工作量计算，已经进入1961年和1962年，甚至1974年。
                      （10月12日人民日报）
    这样，我们便看到了那场问答的正确答案：按地球的运行讲，如今还是1959年；但是，按照那十万多青年工人的生活进度讲，如今却已是1960、1961、1962、1963、1964……年了。
    这场问答的意义也就在这里。地球不会因为人的意志改变它的行程，但是人类的生活却又是一会事。在历史行程中，人是可以凭借主观能动作用来跨越时间的常规的。我国几千年历史上有过不少朝代和帝王的更换，每次改朝换代，都要改一改年号，表示开始一个新的纪元。但是，真正标志了时代变化的又有几个？哪一个又能像我们现在这样，千百万人大显身手，奋勇跨越时间，并力加速推进历史的车轮？
    “跨越时间”的人和事，在我们新中国成立之后，是不断出现过的。但是，像今天这样“大面积”的丰收，却还未曾有过。仅十个省十四个市就有十万多青年工人（中、老年工人还没计算在内）努力跨越时间，全国该有多少？这不能不说是当前工业生产战线上群众运动的一个崭新的面貌。那末，这变化的根本原因何在呢？很明显：十万多青年工人的展翅高飞，是乘了党的八届八中全会决议的“东风”而起。
    我想起了“天高任鸟飞”这句诗。鸟要高飞，先要有广阔的高空。如果把所有的鸟都囚在笼子里，那末，一只鸟也展不起翅膀。但是，有了高空，鸟飞却还有高低远近的差别。大鹏展翅万里，屎壳螂飞三尺就要碰墙，这原因主要又在各自的翅膀不同。因此要高飞，从鸟本身来说，就要先有一副羽毛丰满的硬翅膀。党的八届八中全会，为我们廓清了高空，驱散了阴霾和风暴，送来了助翼东风，造成了大好形势；现在正需要每一个人都武装头脑，解放思想，鼓足干劲，奋翼高飞。我们要跨越时间，提前再提前，当我们再听到：“今年何年”的问声时，回答得更响亮：一九六……！
