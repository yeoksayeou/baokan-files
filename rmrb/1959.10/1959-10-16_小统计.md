    Small Statistics
    Shanghai is the center of China's balance industry, but in old China, the balance industry could not develop at all. According to statistics, Shanghai started producing balances in 1924, and by 1949, it had only produced a total of three or four hundred balances with an accuracy of 1/100 or 1/1000. After liberation, with the rapid development of industrial production, the balance industry has also continued to leap forward. In September alone, the Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory produced more than 2,000 units. These balances are no longer 1/100 or 1/1000, but 1/10000, 1/100000, and 1/1000000.

    小统计
    上海是我国天平工业的中心，但在旧中国天平工业根本得不到发展。据统计，上海从1924年开始生产天平，到1949年总共只生产了三、四百台百分之一、千分之一的天平。解放后，随着工业生产的突飞猛进，天平工业也不断跃进，仅上海天平仪器厂9月一个月就生产二千多台，这些天平再不是百分之一、千分之一，而是万分之一、十万分之一、百万分之一了。
