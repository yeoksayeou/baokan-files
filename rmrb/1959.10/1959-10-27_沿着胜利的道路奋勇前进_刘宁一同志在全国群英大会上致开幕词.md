Comrades and Delegates, honored guests:

The National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade is now open.

Our congress is a congress of heroes, a review of our great achievements in the Great Leap Forward to report to Chairman Mao, the Party and the country, and a rally to raise high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction and advance bravely towards new goals.

Today, leaders of the Party and the state, and responsible comrades of various people's organizations are participating in our congress, expressing their concern and support for our congress. We warmly welcome the leaders of our Party and the state and welcome the responsible persons of various people's organizations. Our congress will also hear their valuable instructions. We will definitely respond to the concern and expectations of the Party and the state with new and brilliant achievements.

Also participating in our congress are representatives of the heroic People's Liberation Army who defend our national defense, representatives of peasants who are bravely advancing by holding high the red flag of the People's Communes, representatives from the scientific and cultural circles, representatives of railway soldiers and civilian workers, representatives of staff and workers' families, and other guests. We extend a warm welcome to all the guests attending this congress.

Attending our congress are 6,576 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers, representing nearly 300,000 advanced collectives and more than 3 million advanced producers on the socialist construction front in our country's industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade. You are the heroes of our great era, the pioneers in implementing the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," and the vanguards of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. You have a high sense of responsibility as masters of the working class and vigorous revolutionary drive. For the benefit of the Party and the people, you contribute all your strength without considering personal gains or losses; you are selfless, put others first, and promote the noble spirit of collectivism and the spirit of communist cooperation; you have the revolutionary courage to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, diligently study, humbly learn, boldly innovate, and create amazing production achievements; you have a communist labor attitude that does not count rewards, working hard without complaint, serving the people wholeheartedly, and making extraordinary achievements in ordinary labor. You concentratedly embody the diligence, bravery, and wisdom of our country's working class, the fine tradition of hard struggle of our country's working class, and the high communist consciousness and fighting will of our country's working class. You deserve to be the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. With such a heroic team that is infinitely loyal to the Party, the motherland, and the people, our cause will be invincible.

Comrades! Shortly before the convening of our congress, we all joyfully celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country. We have seen the earth-shaking changes in our great motherland over the past ten years, the tremendous victory of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the brilliant achievements of our country's construction undertakings. Now, our motherland is in an era of unprecedented prosperity in history, and our country's national economy is leaping forward at a speed that no capitalist country has or could possibly have.

When our congress is convened, our socialist construction cause is in a production upsurge for a better continued leap forward. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the vast number of staff and workers on all fronts, on the basis of the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, and under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have achieved great victories in the anti-Rightist struggle, and have launched an unprecedentedly grand movement to increase production and practice economy and a new upsurge in production and construction throughout the country, and are marching towards new and more magnificent goals with the pace of the Great Leap Forward. Whether it is staff and workers in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, or staff and workers on the scientific and technological and cultural and educational fronts, everyone is full of spirit and enthusiasm. The songs of the Great Leap Forward resound through the sky, and the good news of production flies everywhere. Deeds of technological revolution and technological innovation emerge one after another, and amazing miracles appear every day. Now, we can confidently say that our country's national economy will surely continue to achieve a Great Leap Forward this year.

When our congress is convened, the Party and the state have issued new glorious combat calls to us. It requires us to fight a big battle in the fourth quarter, thoroughly criticize Rightism, boost our energy, complete and overfulfill this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and complete the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule; it requires us to fully support agriculture, and realize agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification in the shortest possible time; it requires us to strive to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and strive to complete the requirements stipulated in the National Program for Agricultural Development (1956-1967) greatly ahead of schedule; it requires us to strive for a continued Great Leap Forward in our country's national economy in the coming years, especially in 1960, on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward last year and this year, so as to thoroughly change the poor and backward face of our country in the shortest possible time, and build our country a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Comrades, this is the great and arduous glorious task placed before us.

The significance of our congress is very important, and the tasks are arduous. We must report the brilliant achievements we have made to our dear Party and Chairman Mao; sum up and exchange the rich experiences since the Great Leap Forward; listen to the instructions given to us by the responsible persons of the Party and the state; and boost greater revolutionary enthusiasm to march towards new goals. We have the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the joint efforts of all the representatives, so we will definitely be able to hold this congress well, and we must hold this congress well.

Comrades, the fact that we can hold such a grand gathering today is entirely the result of the shining of the Party's general line, and the result of the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao. The reason why our various advanced collectives and advanced producers can make advanced achievements and heroic deeds is because they have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the Party's general line. The victory of all our undertakings is ultimately the victory of the Party's general line and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, let us guarantee to our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao: We will definitely hold high the glorious red flag of the general line, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance bravely along the road of victory towards new and more magnificent goals! Advance bravely!

    今天，党和国家的领导人，各人民团体的负责同志都参加了我们的大会，表示了他们对我们大会的关怀和支持，我们热烈地欢迎我们党和国家的领导人，欢迎各人民团体的负责人。我们的大会还将听到他们的宝贵指示。我们一定以新的光辉的成就，回答党和国家对我们的关怀和期望。

    出席我们这次大会的有六千五百七十六名先进集体和先进生产者代表，代表着我国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设战线上近三十万个先进集体和三百多万个先进生产者。你们是我们伟大时代的英雄，是执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的先锋，是社会主义建设大跃进的尖兵。你们有着高度的工人阶级主人翁责任感和旺盛的革命干劲，为着党和人民的利益毫不考虑个人的得失，贡献出了自己的全部力量；你们大公无私，先人后己，发扬了崇高的集体主义精神，发扬了共产主义协作精神；你们有着敢想敢说敢做的革命胆略，顽强钻研，虚心学习，大胆革新，创造了惊人的生产成绩；你们有着不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度，任劳任怨，全心全意为人民服务，在平凡的劳动中，作出了不平凡的事业。你们集中地表现了我国工人阶级的勤劳勇敢和智慧，表现了我国工人阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统，表现了我国工人阶级高度的共产主义觉悟和战斗意志，你们不愧是中华民族最优秀的儿女。有了这样一支对党、对祖国、对人民无限忠心的英雄队伍，我们的事业就会无往而不胜。
    同志们！在我们这次大会召开前不久，我们大家都欢欣鼓舞地庆祝了建国十周年。我们看到了我们伟大祖国十年来翻天覆地的变化，看到了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大胜利，看到了我国各项建设事业的辉煌成就。现在，我们的祖国正处在历史上从未有过的欣欣向荣的时代，我国的国民经济正在以任何资本主义国家所没有的，也不可能有的速度，向前突飞猛进。
    我们这次大会召开的时候，我们社会主义建设事业正处在一个更好地继续跃进的生产高潮中。在党和毛主席领导下，各个战线上的广大职工，在1958年史无前例的大跃进和1959年继续跃进的基础上，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召下，已经取得了反右倾斗争的极大胜利，在全国范围内掀起了空前壮阔的增产节约运动和生产建设新高潮，正以大跃进的步伐，向新的更加宏伟的目标迈进。无论是工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸方面的职工，也无论是科学技术和文化教育战线的职工，人人精神焕发，个个干劲冲天。跃进歌声，响澈云霄，生产捷报，遍地飞来。技术革命和技术革新的事迹层出不穷，惊人奇迹天天出现。现在，我们完全可以有信心地说，今年我国国民经济一定会继续实现大跃进。
    我们这次大会召开的时候，党和国家又向我们发出了新的光荣的战斗号召。要求我们大战第四季度，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，提前完成和超额完成今年国家计划，提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标；要求我们全力支援农业，在最短期间实现农业机械化，水利化，化学化，电气化；要求我们争取在十年左右时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国，并争取大大提前完成农业十二年发展纲要规定的要求；要求我们在去年和今年连续大跃进的基础上，争取今后年份首先是1960年我国国民经济继续大跃进，以便在最短期内彻底改变我国贫穷和落后的面貌，把我国建成一个具有现代工业，现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。同志们，这就是摆在我们面前的伟大而艰巨的光荣任务。
    我们这次大会的意义是十分重大的，任务是繁重的。我们要向我们亲爱的党和毛主席汇报我们取得的辉煌成就；总结和交流大跃进以来的丰富经验；听取党和国家负责人给我们的指示；鼓起更大的革命干劲向新的目标进军。我们有着党和毛主席的领导，有着全体代表的共同努力，我们就一定能开好这次大会，我们也一定要开好这次大会。
    同志们，我们今天能够举行这样盛大的集会，完全是党的总路线光芒照射的结果，是党和毛主席领导和关怀的结果。我们各个先进集体和先进生产者所以能作出先进成绩，作出英雄事业，就是因为有着党和毛主席的英明领导，有着党的总路线。我们一切事业的胜利，归根到底是党的总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。在这里，让我们向我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席保证：我们一定高举总路线的光辉红旗，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，沿着胜利的道路，向着新的更加宏伟的目标，前进！奋勇前进！
