　　At the Korean Military Armistice Commission Meeting
    The Korean-Chinese Side Proposed Relief for Southern Disaster Victims
    Disregarding the Cries of a Million Starving Disaster Victims, the US Side Refused
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th -- Panmunjom Dispatch: At the meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, reiterated the proposal made at the September 28th meeting for both sides to take measures to implement the Korean government's decision to provide relief to the disaster victims in South Korea. He demanded that the US side again carefully consider the draft agreement proposed by the Korean-Chinese side, reach an appropriate agreement with the Korean-Chinese side, and enable the measures of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to provide relief to the disaster victims in South Korea to be realized.
    At the meeting, the US side again stubbornly insisted that this "exceeded the scope of the Military Armistice Commission's authority" and rejected the Korean-Chinese side's proposal.
    Major General Zhu Changjun refuted this unfounded argument at the meeting, pointing out that the measures proposed by the Korean-Chinese side were clearly stipulated in the Armistice Agreement as being within the scope of the Military Armistice Commission's authority. The Military Armistice Commission should do this, and there have been precedents in the past. Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that nearly one million disaster victims in South Korea are in an extremely miserable situation, suffering from hunger, cold, and disease, and facing the threat of death, and that providing relief to them is a matter of utmost urgency. He demanded that the US side carefully consider this issue and agree to the draft agreement proposed by the Korean-Chinese side. However, the US side still rejected this proposal.
    Major General Zhu Changjun then put forward a new proposal, that in order to get the relief supplies from the Republic to the South Korean disaster victims as soon as possible, the Korean-Chinese side would transport the relief supplies to Panmunjom and hand them over to the US side, and the US side would promptly transfer them to the South Korean disaster victims. The US side again refused.
    Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that the US side at the meeting tried to evade the reasonable proposals put forward by the Korean-Chinese side that were in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, and consistently maintained an attitude of complete indifference to the South Korean disaster victims, preventing the South Korean disaster victims from receiving relief from the Republic. He said that whether the South Korean disaster victims can receive relief depends entirely on the attitude of the US side.

　　在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上
    朝中方面建议救济南部灾民
    美方不顾百万灾民嗷嗷待哺竟加拒绝
    新华社平壤13日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会在朝中方面建议下今天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上重申了在9月28日会议上提出的双方为实现朝鲜政府关于救济南朝鲜灾民的决定而采取措施的建议，要求美方再次慎重考虑朝中方面提出的协议草案，同朝中方面达成适当的协议，使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府救济南朝鲜灾民的措施得以实现。
    美方在会上又硬说这“超出军事停战委员会的职权范围”，拒绝了朝中方面的建议。
    朱昌骏少将在会上驳斥美方这种无理论调时指出，朝中方面建议采取的措施，是由停战协定明文规定属于军事停战委员会职权范围以内的问题。军事停战委员会应该这样作，过去也有先例。朱昌骏少将指出，南朝鲜有近一百万灾民正处在极其悲惨的境地，受着饥寒和疾病的折磨，面临死亡的威胁，对他们的救济是刻不容缓的。他要求美方慎重考虑这一问题，同意朝中方面提出的协议草案。但是美方仍然拒绝这一建议。
    朱昌骏少将接着提出了一项新的建议，就是为了尽快地把共和国的救济物资送到南朝鲜灾民手中，由朝中方面把救济物资运到板门店交给美方，由美方及时地转交给南朝鲜灾民。美方又加以拒绝。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方在会上力图规避朝中方面提出的符合停战协定的合理建议，始终抱着对南朝鲜灾民毫不关心的态度，使南朝鲜灾民得不到共和国的救济。他说，南朝鲜灾民能否得到救济，完全取决于美方的态度。
