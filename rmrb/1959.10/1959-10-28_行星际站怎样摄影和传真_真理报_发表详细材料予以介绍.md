Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 27th (TASS): "Pravda" published detailed materials today about the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket. It also published photos of the far side of the moon, illustrations showing the interplanetary station in space during the photography, and a map showing the distribution of mountains, seas, and other objects tentatively identified on the far side of the moon.

    In the materials published, "Pravda" pointed out that the structure of the facsimile instruments on the automatic interplanetary station ensured the workability of the instruments under the complex conditions of space flight. At the same time, it ensured that the photographed materials remained intact under the harmful effects of cosmic radiation and that various instruments, including those processing the captured materials, worked normally under conditions of weightlessness.

    A special directional system automatically aligned the lens of the facsimile camera with the moon.

    "Pravda" indicated that cameras with two lenses, with focal lengths of 200mm and 500mm respectively, took photographs of the far side of the moon according to command signals. Photography of different sizes was carried out simultaneously using these two lenses.

    The 200mm lens captured the entire circular face of the moon. The other lens obtained a much larger image, which exceeded the size of the film, thus providing a more detailed depiction of parts of the lunar disk.

    The photography used a specially made 35mm film that could automatically adjust the exposure. The photographing took approximately 40 minutes, during which the far side of the moon was photographed multiple times.

    The method of transmitting images to Earth was similar to that used by television centers when broadcasting television programs.

    The transmission system could change the number of lines decomposing the image depending on the conditions. One lens had up to 1,000 lines with the most lines.

    The lunar images were sent from the automatic interplanetary station along a radio communication line, which also served to measure the station's operational parameters.

    The total amount of scientific information sent along this line, including the lunar images, far exceeded the total amount of information sent by the first and second Soviet cosmic rockets.

    In order to ensure that a low-power radio transmitter could broadcast images over ultra-long distances, the broadcasting speed had to be tens of thousands of times slower than that used by ordinary television centers.

    With the help of the facsimile system on the Soviet automatic interplanetary station, images were broadcast from a distance of 470,000 kilometers.

    The possibility of ultra-long-distance broadcasting of highly clear intermediate-tone images in cosmic space, without significant and special distortions of the image during radio wave propagation, has been confirmed for the first time through this experiment.

    行星际站怎样摄影和传真
    “真理报”发表详细材料予以介绍
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：“真理报”今天发表了关于苏联第三个宇宙火箭的详细材料，还刊登了月球背面的照片，说明自动行星际站摄影时在空间的状况的图片，以及初步查明的月球背面的山和海等对象的分布情况图。
    “真理报”在发表的材料中指出，自动行星际站上的传真仪器的结构保证了仪器在宇宙飞行的复杂条件下的工作能力。同时，还保证了摄得的材料能够在宇宙辐射有害影响的条件下保持完整，保证各种仪器，包括对摄得材料进行加工的仪器在失重的条件下工作正常。
    专门的定向系统可以自动使传真摄影仪器的镜头对准月球。
    “真理报”指出，带有焦距分别为二百毫米和五百毫米的两个镜头的照相机，按照指挥信号摄下了月球背面的照片。利用这两个镜头同时进行了尺寸不同的摄影。
    焦距为二百毫米的镜头把整个圆面摄入了镜头。而另一个镜头获得的影像很大，影像超出了底片的范围，因而，对月球圆面部分作了更精细的描绘。
    拍照用的是特制的三十五毫米的胶片，它可以自动改变曝光。拍摄大约历时四十分钟，在这段时间内，对月球背面进行了多次拍摄。
    把影像传送到地球上的方法就像电视中心在播送电视片时的方法一样。
    传送系统可以根据条件改变分解影像的行数。一个镜头行数最多的达到一千行。
    月球影像沿无线电通讯线路从自动行星际站上发送下来，无线电通讯线路同时还为测量行星际站本身的运行参数服务。
    沿这条线路发送的科学情报总量，包括月球的影像，远远超过了第一个和第二个苏联宇宙火箭所发送的情报量的总和。
    为了保证功率很小的无线电发射机能够超远距地播送影像，播送的速度要比一般电视中心用的播送速度慢数万倍。
    借助于苏联自动行星际站上的传真系统，影像播送的距离达四十七万公里。
    在宇宙空间可以把高度清晰的中间色调的影像作超远距的播送，而且在无线电波传播的过程中，影像不致有重大的特殊的变形。经过这次实验，上述这种可能性已经第一次被肯定下来了。
