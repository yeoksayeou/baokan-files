Vanguard in the Cultural Revolution
By our reporter Bao Chunguang

The livestock owners, leading healthy animals out of the veterinary hospital affiliated with Nanjing Agricultural College, praised with smiles: "Dean Wang is really capable, he really has a knack for it...!" The person they were praising is named Wang Yuanlin, who graduated from Nanjing Agricultural College last year and became the vice president of the affiliated veterinary hospital.

This veterinarian, who enjoys such prestige in the eyes of livestock owners, was an illiterate before liberation who couldn't even write his own name. After liberation, with the cultivation of the Party, he completed a course of study in seven years that would normally take sixteen, breaking into the gate of culture, science and technology, and becoming a model of a new type of working-class intellectual.

When the War of Liberation was won, Wang Yuanlin followed the army south in the support-the-front troops. He rode in a ten-wheeled truck for the first time, feeling like he was flying forward. He was very curious, thinking: "This thing is amazing, it would be interesting to be a driver!" Along the way, whenever the car stopped, he would approach the driver and ask questions. He asked the driver, "Is it easy to learn?" The driver told him that he had to learn the principles first. But learning the principles requires literacy. Once again, he and some comrades visited a tractor. He circled the big iron ox several times, touching it here and there, mumbling: This monster can be worth so many cows! But when he inquired "whether it is easy to learn", the answer given to him was still "literacy".

Culture, as far as Wang Yuanlin was concerned, was what he lacked the most. He was born into a family that had been begging for three generations, begging in his mother's womb, and continuing to beg on his mother's back after birth, all the way until he joined the revolution. He was only fourteen years old when he started revolutionary work. At that time, he thought that being able to shoot a gun was the most capable thing, and he would follow anyone carrying a gun around to watch. Later, when he joined the peasant theater troupe, he still loved playing with guns. But now, a gun cannot start a tractor. He recalled that on the eve of victory, the respected Chairman Mao had said: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and the things we are not familiar with are being forced to do." Since culture is so important to building socialism, then let's learn it! After making this decision, Wang Yuanlin actively studied written Chinese. With the specific help of Comrade Cai Jiaju of the Party branch, by 1951, he had already learned a lot of characters, and in the same year, he was admitted to the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School.

Wang Yuanlin, who had never been to school for a day, although he had learned some characters in the cultural troupe, still had many difficulties in coping with the school's learning tasks. In overcoming these difficulties, Wang Yuanlin created a whole set of learning methods.

The first difficulty he encountered was: not knowing enough characters. At this time, when he saw a character, he learned one character like a hungry man seeing food. This method of learning was not easy to remember, and he didn't know the use of these characters. Later, he thought of a classification method of learning characters, learning a large string at a time. When he saw daily necessities, he learned clothes, shoes, toothbrushes, toothpaste, quilts, tents... all at once. When eating, he learned words like bowl, plate, basin, vegetables. Since he used his mouth to eat, he practiced writing words like teeth, chew, swallow, and gulp. When working, he learned words like sweeping the floor, transplanting rice seedlings, and weeding. He learned whatever he did. After learning this way for a while, he learned a lot of characters. On this basis, he further put words with the same pronunciation together to learn, such as 　成、呈、陈、沉……, not only learning to recognize them, but also clarifying their meaning and usage.

Learning arithmetic was even more difficult for Wang Yuanlin than learning Chinese. When learning about decimal points, he often misplaced them. How to understand this principle? He gestured in various ways. Once, he put his hands together, and then separated them. After several times, he seemed to realize, saying that the principle was here. Putting the thumbs together is equal to two thumbs. If the thumb and index finger are put together, it is not equal to two thumbs, but only equal to one thumb and one index finger. Since then, he has not encountered any difficulties in this matter.

Three years of study required Wang Yuanlin to reach the level of high school graduation in order to take the university entrance examination. In addition to studying, he also served as the secretary of the student Party branch and was also the class monitor. With so much homework and so much work, his difficulties were unimaginable. Sometimes, he felt that the difficulties rushing towards him were like mountains, overwhelming him. With a poor foundation and busy work, Wang Yuanlin could only rest and sleep less, squeezing out as much time as possible to study. Wang Yuanlin did not enter the dormitory until long after the lights were turned off every day; he got up again before dawn. One quiet night, he once asked himself: "Can I learn well with so many difficulties?" But when he heard the rumbling of the motors in the factory, he quickly said to himself: Socialist construction is waiting for us, I must learn well. He often wrote the difficult formulas on his hands, and recited them whenever he had time. When the lights were turned off in the dormitory, Wang Yuanlin was still reciting his lessons in bed. When he encountered something he couldn't remember, he secretly went to the electric light in the toilet to read.

In the three years of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, Wang Yuanlin, who was almost illiterate, completed the coursework that ordinary students would study for twelve years. In the end, he bid farewell to the accelerated secondary school with an average score of over three.

After graduating from the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, Wang Yuanlin was admitted to the higher education institution of Nanjing Agricultural College, and first chose the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine.

On Wang Yuanlin's first day as a college student, difficulties followed him closely. Higher physics, organic chemistry... were all such "mysterious" things. In particular, learning Latin was a big storm that almost knocked Wang Yuanlin out; but to be a veterinarian, one must learn Latin.

The first time he attended a Latin class, the students read in unison, but Wang Yuanlin didn't even know how to move his mouth. Wang Yuanlin couldn't understand what the teacher was saying, what diphthongs, syllables, verb changes, etc., he had never heard of before. He was so nervous that he felt dizzy. The teacher lecturing on the stage seemed to become a foreigner. Twenty subtitles were discussed in two classes, and the teacher asked "Do you understand?" "Yes!" "Is it too fast?" "No!" The answers below were in unison. The relaxed expressions of the students made Wang Yuanlin even more afraid. Wang Yuanlin had never been to an enemy court, but he kept thinking: "Perhaps it wouldn't be more uncomfortable in an enemy court than it is now!" It was still a cold day wearing cotton-padded clothes, but Wang Yuanlin's underwear was soaked with sweat in the classroom. A question kept haunting him: "Can I learn Latin well?"

During self-study, Wang Yuanlin thought a lot. He thought of what the general branch secretary often encouraged him: "Communists are hard bones, communists are never afraid of difficulties!" He also remembered that during the period of struggle against the enemy, it was so difficult, but he never lost confidence in victory... "It's outrageous!" Wang Yuanlin began to blame himself. "I haven't been scared by the enemy in the face of life and death. Latin doesn't eat people, so why am I afraid! If I can't learn Latin well, hasn't the Party cultivated me for so many years in vain!" He picked up his book and went to find the teaching assistant.

The teaching assistant was a young man. He said to Wang Yuanlin with a smile: "I was just about to look for you. I heard that you are having a particularly hard time learning Latin. The leadership just gave me a task to help you learn Latin well." So Wang Yuanlin started learning from scratch under the individual guidance of the teaching assistant. That day, both of them were covered in sweat, the teaching assistant's throat was hoarse from teaching, and Wang Yuanlin also became hoarse from learning. From then on, Wang Yuanlin recited while walking, recited even when going to the toilet, and thought about Latin even when lying in bed. People in the same dormitory often asked him: "Why are you still muttering in your mouth when you are asleep?" It turned out that Wang Yuanlin was still reading new words in his dreams! After a forty-day sprint, Wang Yuanlin overcame Latin: he got the best score in the exam: "Five points"!

In the past few years of study life, Wang Yuanlin has developed many skills to overcome difficulties. No matter what difficulties he encounters, he can think of a way to deal with them. College students have to take their own notes in class, and Wang Yuanlin was so anxious that he was sweating, but he still couldn't write them down. He had only written a big title, and the teacher had already said a long paragraph. When he wanted to review his lessons at night, Wang Yuanlin opened his notebook, and there were only a few intermittent and meaningless sentences. When he started to overcome this difficulty, whenever he had time, he asked his classmates to read newspapers and books, and he practiced recording beside them. Later, he thought that everyone has their own study plans, and it is not a long-term solution to trouble others often. Once, when he was considering this issue, the broadcaster was transmitting the weather forecast. He dropped his troubles, quickly took out paper and pen and recorded it, every day. At the beginning, he practiced recording the forecast broadcast twice, and after remembering every word, he asked himself to record the forecast broadcast once. After being able to record the weather forecast in full, he practiced recording the news broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. After more than half a month, Wang Yuanlin's hands became skilled, and he wrote down wherever the teacher lectured. Wang Yuanlin went to practice to solve the theoretical problems that were difficult to understand in class. When the teacher talked about the "lying horse method," he talked for a long time, and Wang Yuanlin went to the livestock to touch and look, and understood it in five minutes. The teacher talked about artificial insemination for more than twenty hours, but the students still didn't know how to operate it. Wang Yuanlin participated in it once himself, and then listened to the teacher's lecture, and understood it quickly. What organs are in what positions, what bones are in what shapes, he would go to the anatomy room after class to dissect dead horses and dead pigs according to the charts. He also often went to the veterinary hospital to see sick animals and analyze medical records. This not only increased practical knowledge, but also facilitated the understanding and memory of book knowledge.

In his studies, Wang Yuanlin didn't know how many passes he had overcome, and how many difficulties he had encountered. Judging from his academic performance, he was a victorious general in the face of difficulties. In the four years of university, Wang Yuanlin's academic performance gradually improved. In the first year, some subjects failed, in the second year he eliminated the failures, in the third year all were good, and in the fourth year he rose to excellent, becoming an outstanding graduate recognized by the whole class.

Wang Yuanlin graduated from university last year, but this was not his goal, but the starting point for him to engage in socialist construction. In the year since coming to the veterinary hospital, Wang Yuanlin has been strict with himself and has lived more nervously than when he was in college. He often said: "Isn't our Party's proposal to catch up with Britain in fifteen years precisely for being strict with ourselves?" Apart from all work, he also squeezed out three hours a day to study. He has planned and regulated "time indicators" for morning exercises, sleep, and even eating and washing his face, so that every inch of precious time will not slip away from him lightly.

People admire Wang Yuanlin's learning spirit. Some people are also anxious for Wang Yuanlin, "Even gnawing on books on weekends, it's too boring!" Individual comrades even jokingly call him "big book bag".

In fact, Wang Yuanlin has his own hobbies. After a day of outpatient service, there are always some questions swirling in his mind: Is the diagnosis correct? Did I say something wrong to the interns? What things in the book did I not think of at the time? What things in the book are inaccurate or unmentioned, and need to be corrected or supplemented... This high sense of responsibility for work and the spirit of research into science makes Wang Yuanlin feel that reading books is more urgent and more interesting than strolling around Xuanwu Lake, watching movies, or playing poker.

In the veterinary hospital, he also combined production labor with outpatient service to carry out scientific research work. The projects that have been successfully researched include: ovine infectious keratitis, bovine Theileriosis, ovine necrotic bacillus stomatitis, rapid pig fattening method, oleaginous penicillin and cod liver oil and the treatment of deep suppurative sores, etc. His purpose in conducting scientific research is very clear: to serve production and to serve teaching. Wherever livestock are sick, he sleeps there to treat them, and scientific research topics are also drawn from production. In Yaohuamen People's Commune in Nanjing, 160 dairy goats suffered from infectious keratitis, threatening production and the safety of the flock. He studied ovine infectious keratitis in response to this problem.

He organized an investigation team, a treatment team, a symptom observation and recording team, a bacterial culture team, a virus isolation team, and a tissue sectioning team in the veterinary hospital. During the research period, Wang Yuanlin examined more than 50 books on ovine eye diseases. After more than a month of work, the sheep diseases in Yaohua Commune were all cured, and their research work was also successfully completed. Because Wang Yuanlin saw a large number of outpatient animals in the veterinary hospital, he discovered symptoms and treatments that had never been seen in books, greatly enriching the book knowledge.

In the work of actively carrying out pig fattening experiments in various places after the people's commune, Wang Yuanlin carried out 14 kinds of pig fattening experiments to promote the rapid fattening of pigs. He first resected the thyroid gland for pig fattening experiments, and performed more than 80 times in a row, and finally succeeded. The experimental pigs gained two catties per day, and the highest gain was twelve catties. But he was not satisfied, and continued to carry out tail cutting, ear cutting, thyroid injection with milk, cod liver oil, chicken eggs, and fed pigs with various medicinal powders for a total of 14 kinds of fattening experiments. Among them, except for the poor effect of the parotid gland, other types have the effect of gaining two catties and more than six catties per day. Recently, various agencies, farms, people's communes, schools and livestock and veterinary staff have written letters one after another, asking Wang Yuanlin to introduce his pig fattening method.

Wang Yuanlin not only studies his profession, but also loves to study politics. When he reads Party history, many exciting and magnificent scenes immediately appear in his mind, and he remembers countless heroic figures. After reading the book "The Great Creation of Ordinary People", he learned about the moving deeds of our country's skilled craftsman Lu Ban, divine doctor Hua Tuo, astronomer Zhang Heng, and also learned about the inventions and creations of world-renowned scientists such as Lomonosov, Michurin, and Edison. From books, Wang Yuanlin's horizons have been broadened, his knowledge has been enriched, he has seen many interesting stories from ancient and modern China and foreign countries, and he has also gained many useful lessons.

Wang Yuanlin studies so diligently in order to realize his wish: to become an outstanding veterinarian expert who is both red and expert within five years. He wants to move forward on the road of scientific research, just like he conquered the cultural fortress. (Attached image)

    文化革命中的闯将
    本报记者　鲍春光
    从南京农学院附属兽医院牵出一头头健康牲畜的畜主，喜笑盈盈地夸赞说：“王院长真行，他就是有一手……！”他们夸奖的这个人，名叫王元林，他去年从南京农学院毕业，并当了附属兽医院的副院长。
    在畜主心目中这样有名望的一位兽医，解放前还是一个连自己名字都写不好的文盲，解放以后，在党的培养下，他以七年时间走完别人需要十六年才能走完的学习路程，闯进了文化科学技术的大门，成为一个新型的工农劳动人民知识化的标兵。
    解放战争胜利了，王元林在支前部队里随着大军南下，他第一次乘上十轮大卡车，感到像飞一样地向前疾驶，他稀奇得很，心想：“这玩意儿真了不起，做个司机多有意思！”一路上，车一停，他就凑到司机旁边问长问短，他问司机“容易学吗？”司机告诉他要先学原理。可是，学原理是要有文化的。又一次，他和一些同志一起参观拖拉机，他围着这个大铁牛转了几个圈圈，东摸摸，西摸摸，嘴里不断地嘀咕：这个怪物，能抵上多少条牛啊！可是当他打听“是否容易学”的时候，给他的回答仍然是要“文化”。
    文化，在王元林说来，却是最缺少的。他生在一个三代要饭的人家，在娘肚里要饭，出生以后，被背在娘背上还是要饭，一直要到参加革命。他参加革命工作时，才十四岁，那时候，他认为会打枪，就是最有本领的人，他看见一个背枪的人，就跟住人家转来转去的看，后来参加农民剧团，他还是很爱玩手枪。可是，现在，用手枪却不能开动拖拉机。他想起胜利前夕，敬爱的毛主席曾经讲过：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”既然文化对建设社会主义这样重要，那就学吧！王元林下了这个决心后，就积极学习方块字。在党支部蔡家驹同志的具体帮助下，到1951年，他已经识了不少字，并在同年，考进了工农速成中学。
    一天学校门没有进过的王元林，虽然在文工团里识了一些字，但要应付学校的学习任务，还是困难很多的。在克服这些困难中，王元林创造了一整套的学习方法。
    他首先碰到的困难是：识的字不够用。这时候，他见到字，就像饿汉见食一样见到一个字就学一个字。这样学法很不好记忆，也不知道这些字的用处，后来他想了一个分类的识字方法，一学一大串。他看到日用生活用品时，就把衣服、鞋子、牙刷、牙膏、被子、帐子……等一气学完。在吃饭时，就学碗、盘、盆、菜之类的字。吃饭用嘴，他就练习写牙齿、嚼、吞、咽等字。在劳动的时候，他就学习扫地、插秧、耘草等字，做什么就学什么。这样学了一个时候以后，他学会了不少字，在这个基础上，他又进一步把字音相同的字放在一块学，如成、呈、陈、沉……，不但学会认，并且还弄清它的意思和用法。
    王元林学算术，比学语文还要困难，在学小数点时，他经常把位置弄错，怎样弄懂这个道理？他用各种方法比划着。有一次他把两只手合在一起，然后又把两手错开，几次以后，他若有所悟地说，道理原来在这里。大拇指和大拇指合在一起，就等于两个大拇指，如果大拇指和食指合在一起，就不等于两个大拇指了，只能等于一个大拇指和一个食指。从此，他在这个问题上没有碰到过什么困难。
    三年学习，要求王元林能达到高中毕业水平，去考大学。除了学习，他还担任学生党支部书记，还兼任班长。这么多的功课和这么多的工作，他的困难是难以想像的。有时候，他感到一个个向他冲过来的困难，简直像大山一样，把他压得喘不过气来。基础差，工作忙，王元林只有少休息少睡觉，挤出尽可能多的时间来学习。每天熄灯很久以后，王元林才进宿舍；早晨天还没亮，他又起来了，在一个夜深人静的夜晚，他曾经问过自己：“这样多的困难，我能学好吗？”但他听到工厂里隆隆响动的马达声时，他又很快地对自己说：社会主义建设在等待着我们，我一定要学好。他把难以对付的公式经常写在手心里，一有空就念几遍。宿舍熄灯了，王元林在床上还在背功课，遇有记不得的地方，他就偷偷地到厕所里的电灯光下去看书。
    在工农速成中学的三年，近似文盲的王元林学完了一般学生学习十二年的功课，最后他以平均三分以上的成绩告别了速成中学。
    王元林从速中毕业后，考进了高等文化学府——南京农学院，第一个选择了畜牧兽医系。
    王元林做大学生的第一天，困难就紧紧地跟着他，高等物理、有机化学……都是那样“玄”的东西，尤其是学习拉丁文一场大风浪，差点儿没把王元林打晕掉；但做一个兽医，一定要学会拉丁文。
    第一次上拉丁文课的时候，同学们读得一条声，王元林却连嘴巴也不知该怎样动。先生讲的，王元林连头也摸不到，什么二合音、音量、动词变化等等，从来就没听过。他紧张得有些晕眩，台上讲课的先生好像成了外国人。两节课讲了二十个小标题，先生问“懂不懂？”“懂！”“快不快？”“不快！”下边答成一条声。同学们那种轻松的神情，更加使王元林害怕。王元林没有上过敌人的法庭，但他老在想：“在敌人法庭上也许不会比现在更难受！”这天还是穿棉袄的寒天，王元林在课堂上却把内衣汗湿了。一个疑问老在纠缠着他：“我能学好拉丁文？”
    自习时，王元林想了很多。他想到总支书记经常勉励他的话：“共产党员是硬骨头，共产党员永远也不怕困难！”他还想起在对敌斗争时期，那样困难，对胜利也没失掉信心……“真不像话！”王元林开始责备自己了。“在生死关头都没被敌人吓倒过，拉丁文又不吃人，怎么就害怕起来呢！要学不好拉丁文，党不是白培养我这么多年吗！”他拿起书本就去找助教。
    助教是个小青年。他笑嘻嘻地对王元林说：“我正想去找你。听说你学拉丁文特别费劲，领导上刚才交给我一个任务，要我帮助你学好拉丁文。”于是王元林就在助教个别辅导下从头学起。这一天，两人都出了一身汗，助教喉咙教哑了，王元林也学哑了。从那以后，王元林除正课时间以外，走路念，上厕所也念，睡在床上还想着拉丁文。同宿舍的人常问他：“你睡着了嘴里怎么还在叽叽咕咕的？”原来王元林在梦中还在读生字呢！经过四十天突击，王元林战胜了拉丁文：考试时得了最优秀的成绩：“五分”！
    这几年的学习生活，王元林练出了许多克服困难的本领，不论什么困难，他都能想出一套对付的方法。大学生听课，要自己记笔记，王元林急得直冒汗，还是记不下来。他才写好一个大题目，教师又讲了一大段。晚上要复习功课，王元林翻开笔记本，上面只有几个断断续续地不成意思的句子。他开始克服这个困难时，一有空就请同学读报、念书，他在旁边练习记录。后来他想，大家都有自己的学习计划，经常麻烦别人总不是长久之计。有一次他正在考虑这个问题，播音器在传送天气预报，他丢掉了烦恼，迅速拿出纸和笔就记录起来，每天如此。开始时，他练习记录广播两次的预报，记得一字不差以后，他又要求自己记录广播一次的预报。天气预报能够全文记录以后，他又练习记录中央人民广播电台播送的新闻。半个多月以后，王元林的手练熟了，教师讲到那里，他就记到那里。王元林对课堂上难以理解的理论问题，就到实际中间求解决。教师讲“横卧倒马法”，讲了许多时，王元林跑到牲口旁边摸摸看看，五分钟就弄懂了。教师讲人工授精讲了二十多个钟头，学生们还不知如何操作，王元林自己参加做一次，再听老师讲课，理解很快。课堂上讲了什么器官在什么位置，什么骨头什么形状，课后他就到解剖室去，照着挂图解剖死马死猪。他还常到兽医院去看病畜，分析病历。这样既增加了实际知识，又便于理解和记忆书本知识。
    在学习上，王元林不知道闯过了多少关，遇到了多少困难，从他的学业成绩看，他是一位在困难面前的常胜将军。在大学的四年里，王元林的学习成绩是逐步上升的。第一年有些功课不及格，第二年消灭了不及格，第三年全部良好，第四年更上升到优良，成为全班公认的优秀毕业生。
    王元林去年从大学毕业，但这并不是他的目的，而是他从事社会主义建设事业的起点。来到兽医院的这一年，王元林自己紧自己，过得比读大学时还紧张。他常说：“我们党提出十五年内赶过英国不正是为了自己紧自己吗？”一切工作除外，每天他还挤出三个小时来学习。早操、睡觉、甚至连吃饭、洗脸，他都有计划地规定了“时间指标”，不使每一寸宝贵的光阴从身边轻轻溜掉。
    人们钦佩王元林的学习精神。也有些人为王元林着急，“连周末礼拜也啃书，太无味了！”个别同志甚至戏谑的叫他“大书包”。
    其实，王元林有自己的爱好，他在一天门诊以后，总有一些问题在脑子里盘旋：诊断得对不对？给实习的同学讲错了没有？书上讲的那些东西有哪些当时自己没想到？有些什么东西书上说得不确切或是没说到，需要修正或是补充上去……这种对工作的高度的责任感和对科学的钻研精神，使王元林感到看书比逛玄武湖、比看电影、比打扑克更迫切需要，更有兴趣。
    在兽医院内他还结合生产劳动，结合门诊，开展科学研究工作。已经研究成功的项目有：羊传染性角膜炎，乳牛泰氏焦虫病，羊坏死干菌口炎，快速肥猪法，油剂青霉素及鱼肝油和对深部化浓疮的治疗等。他进行科学研究的目的很明确：为生产服务、为教学服务。哪里家畜生病，他就睡在哪里治疗，科学研究题目也是从生产中提出来的。南京市尧化门人民公社里有一百六十头奶羊发生传染性角膜炎，威胁到生产和羊群安全。就这个问题他就研究羊传染性角膜炎。
    他在兽医院内组织了调查组、治疗组、病状观察记录组、细菌培养组、病毒分离组、组织切片等。在研究期间，王元林查看了五十多本有关羊眼病的书籍。经过一个多月的工作，尧化公社的羊病全部治好，他们的研究工作也出色地完成任务。王元林在兽医院由于门诊病畜头次看得多，发现了书本上从未有过的病状与治疗方法，大大充实了书本知识。
    在人民公社化后，各地积极开展生猪肥育试验的工作中，王元林进行了十四种猪的肥育试验，推动生猪快速肥育工作。他首先切除甲状腺作肥猪试验，一连进行八十多次，终于成功了，试验猪每天增重二斤，最高增重十二斤。但是他并不满足，他继续进行了切尾、切耳、用牛奶、鱼肝油、鸡蛋白注射甲状腺，颔下腺，腮腺，用多种药粉喂猪进行肥育试验共十四种。其中除耳下腺效果不好外，其他各种都有每天增重二斤及六斤以上的效果。最近各地机关、农场、人民公社、学校等单位以及畜牧兽医工作人员，先后纷纷来信，要王元林介绍他的肥猪方法。
    王元林不但钻研业务，而且也爱学习政治。他读党史时，脑子里马上就映现了许多激动人心的壮丽情景，忆起了无数可歌可泣的英雄人物。读了“平凡人的伟大创造”一书后，知道了我国巧匠鲁班、神医华佗、天文学家张衡的动人事迹，也了解了罗蒙诺索夫、米丘林、爱迪生等世界著名科学家的发明创造。从书本里，王元林的眼界开阔了，知识丰富了，看到了许多古今中外的有趣故事，并且得到了不少有益的教训。
    王元林这样勤奋的学习，是为了实现自己的心愿：五年内使自己成为一个又红又专的优秀兽医专家，他要在科学研究的道路上，也像他攻克文化堡垒那样迈步前进。（附图片）
