Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 15th: Reporter Han Wenhui reports: The leap forward situation on Xinjiang's industrial production and construction and transportation fronts is getting better and better. Currently, hundreds of thousands of people of all ethnic groups are carrying out anti-rightist struggles, boosting their energy, and fighting hard in the fourth quarter, trying every means to complete the national annual plan ten to twenty days ahead of schedule.

The current situation on Xinjiang's industrial and transportation fronts is extremely favorable for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. As of the end of September, the total industrial output value had completed more than 80% of the annual plan, and the output value completed in nine months was more than 100 million yuan more than the total output value for the entire year of last year. The production plans for major industrial products have all completed 70% to 80% of the annual plan. The plan to produce 120,000 tons of pig iron for the entire year was completed more than three months ahead of schedule on September 6th; products such as machinery, coal, cement, electricity generation, timber, and cotton yarn have all completed more than 70%. Although the crude oil production plan has been revised and leap-forwarded several times this year, it had also completed more than 70% of the annual plan by the end of September. Based on the crude oil daily production level in September, the annual oil extraction plan can be completed in November. The basic construction and highway transportation fronts have also completed about 80% of the annual plan. Steel and steel products among industrial products have a relatively poor completion rate of the plan, because the newly added equipment capacity was put into production relatively late. However, by the end of September, the number of converters put into production in Xinjiang had reached 32, and the production capacity had increased several times compared with the actual production capacity before August; in terms of steel production, the new rolling mill with an annual production capacity of 120,000 tons at the "August 1st" Steel Plant will be put into production in October. Therefore, the annual plan for steel and steel products can still be completed ahead of schedule.

A more favorable condition for overfulfilling the annual plan is that since the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the industrial and transportation fronts, the production outlook and the mental outlook of the workers have been completely renewed. The subjective initiative of the people has been universally brought into play, and the past style of empty talk about difficulties has been swept away. Cadres generally go deep into the grassroots level and actively solve difficulties by standing in the midst of them. A vigorous upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy with practical work, hard work, and clever work has already formed on all fronts.

At the beginning of October, the Autonomous Region Party Committee separately deployed the tasks for the industrial production and construction and transportation departments for the fourth quarter. Currently, all factories, mines, and enterprises are taking anti-rightism as the key, boosting their energy, mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, formulate measures, and launch a larger upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. The Metallurgical Administration Bureau proposed to complete the annual steel and steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule, and recently convened the Fifth Steelmaking Conference, organizing the third steel seizure campaign, requiring to double the steel output in October. The basic construction departments, based on the principle of concentrating forces and ensuring key projects, have sorted out various projects and are making every effort to ensure that key projects such as steel, machinery, oil, and coal are put into production as early as possible. They proposed to complete the annual plan one month ahead of schedule, and to exceed the quota by 10% by the end of the year. The workers on the petroleum industry front are pushing the oil seizure battle to a new climax. All mining areas are continuing to deepen the anti-rightist struggle, boost their energy, and launch mass movements, determined to complete the annual oil extraction plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. The workers in the Karamay mining area, who are responsible for the majority of crude oil production, have continuously increased the daily crude oil production level since October 7th after taking measures to focus on well repairs and oil collection, and transform low-yield wells into high-yield wells. The Dushanzi Refinery created an unprecedented record for daily crude oil processing volume and light oil recovery rate on October 5th, with the light oil recovery rate reaching 54.2%, exceeding the planned target. The transportation department held a telephone conference at the beginning of the month, and based on the principle of ensuring key transportation tasks such as raw materials for the steel industry, machinery and equipment, timber, grain, and market supplies, deployed the tasks for the fourth quarter, requiring all localities to conduct a red flag competition campaign for safety, economy, and ten thousand ton-kilometers per car-ton per month, and complete the annual transportation task one month ahead of schedule.

In order to meet the leap forward requirements on various fronts, the Autonomous Region Party Committee recently issued instructions requiring the immediate mobilization of 100,000 people, 30,000 trucks, and 40,000 pack animals to undertake short-distance transportation tasks throughout Xinjiang.

People's Daily, Harbin, 14th: Since the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a great situation has emerged in Heilongjiang Province. The total industrial output value in September has exceeded any month in history, an increase of more than one-third compared to August. Since October, more than one million workers in the province have further launched a vigorous competition movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced, setting off a new upsurge of comprehensive leap forward. Currently, they are fighting hard to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee believes that Heilongjiang Province has extremely favorable conditions for achieving a continued leap forward. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, party organizations and the broad masses of people throughout the province have gained extremely rich experience in achieving the Great Leap Forward. This year's Great Leap Forward has a more solid material foundation, people's communes are developing soundly, and especially after implementing the spirit of anti-rightism and boosting morale from the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of cadres and people have high enthusiasm, great drive, and sharply increased output. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that achieving this year's Great Leap Forward in the province is certainly not an easy task. Therefore, it is required that all localities in the province further and conscientiously implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee's Enlarged Meeting, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy more extensively and deeply.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee proposed that in this year's Great Leap Forward, it is necessary to fully utilize the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, not only focusing on the increase in output value and output, but also continuously improving product quality, reducing costs, and strengthening equipment maintenance, in order to achieve safe production. In organizing this year's Great Leap Forward, it is also necessary to prepare for next year's production, striving to maintain the production level of the fourth quarter of this year in the first quarter of next year; in agriculture, it is necessary to prepare for turning the land, water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, seeds, tools, and welcoming the further expansion of agricultural mechanization. In the entire national economy, it is necessary to continue to implement the requirements of ensuring key projects and leading the overall situation, strengthen cooperation and collaboration, so that all aspects can develop in a coordinated manner in the Great Leap Forward, and the province's movement to increase production and practice economy can continue to advance vigorously and steadily, laying a good foundation for the Great Leap Forward in 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th: Reporter Guo Huo reports: After carrying out anti-rightist struggles and boosting energy, the industrial and transportation fronts in Taiyuan City fought hard in August and September, and production leaped to a new level. The situation is unprecedentedly good, creating extremely favorable conditions for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment.

Now, the broad masses of workers in various industrial and mining enterprises are full of energy and high spirits. The high tide of the competition movement to complete the annual plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule is advancing wave after wave. Following the early completion of the third quarter plan by more than 190 factories and mines in September, a group of advanced factories, mines, workshops, and teams have completed the fourth quarter and annual plans ahead of schedule, and have stepped into 1960 by leaps and bounds. Since October, the output of several major products such as steel, iron, and raw coal in the city has increased in the first ten days of the month compared with the same period in September, with steel increasing by 6.05%, iron increasing by 20.95%, and raw coal increasing by 3.41%.

The rapid and comprehensive increase in the production level is the main feature of the new situation. Since August and September, the city's industrial production has exceeded each month and each ten-day period. The city's total industrial output value in August increased by 16.01% compared to July, and September increased sharply by 33.94% compared to August, overfulfilling the monthly plan by 26%. From January to September, the city's total industrial output value increased by 56.6% compared to the same period last year. Compared with August, the output of various major products in September increased: steel increased by 27.3%, pig iron increased by 17.7%, steel increased by 30.4%, raw coal increased by 13.8%, and all of them were rising in a straight line. While the output increased, various economic indicators such as product quality and cost are also making comprehensive leaps forward. In September, the pass rate of steel and steel products in the city increased by 27.1% and 0.71% compared with August, and costs continued to decrease. Seventeen factories in the city have completed the annual cost reduction plan ahead of schedule. According to statistics from 160 industrial and mining enterprises, the labor productivity in August increased by 15.86% compared with July, and in September it increased by 35.06% compared with August.

The excellent situation on the industrial and transportation fronts in Taiyuan City is the result of the earnest implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party by various industrial and mining enterprises. In August, when the Party Central Committee issued instructions on anti-rightism, boosting energy, and practicing increasing production and practicing economy, various industrial and mining enterprises immediately criticized the right-leaning and lax sentiments that had grown in some cadres. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule brought great heat to the broad masses of workers on the industrial front. Everyone raised their eyebrows and breathed easily, and had soaring energy. No matter whether it was a large factory or a small factory, everywhere was a scene of vows, competitions, performances, evaluations, setting up pacesetters, and looking for opponents. The competition movement quickly formed a climax.

In the magnificent mass movement to increase production and practice economy, the communist style of cooperation is flourishing, and has seen new developments and new creations on the basis of the past. In the competition among various factories, mines, and enterprises, there are "learning, catching up, and helping competitions" focusing on key products, "chain competitions," "one-stop collaboration competitions," and the organization of "volunteer armies," etc. The variety of forms, the scale, and the high level of communist style are unmatched by previous movements.

The development of the technical innovation movement has added rich content to the mass movement to increase production and practice economy. In September, more than 25,000 technical innovation projects were implemented in the city, including 1,026 major projects. These suggestions, when applied to production, greatly promoted the leap forward in production.

According to the deployment of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the average daily production level of various major products in the fourth quarter has greatly increased compared with the actual output in the third quarter. Among them, steel increased by 42%, pig iron increased by 14%, steel increased by 26%, and raw coal increased by 6.8%. The Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all workers in the city to thoroughly criticize right-leaning lax ideas and the style of empty talk about difficulties in the fourth quarter, boost their energy, take effective measures, and try every means to push the already formed new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy to a higher stage, ensure that the output of various major products rises steadily month by month, strive to complete the annual production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and prepare for production in the first quarter of next year.

　　鼓起最大干劲走在时间前面
    新疆黑龙江立志提前完成全年国家计划
    太原职工大搞竞赛把生产全面提高到新的水平
    新华社乌鲁木齐15日电　记者韩文慧报道：新疆工业生产建设和交通运输战线上的跃进形势越来越好。目前，数十万各民族职工正在反右倾、鼓干劲，大战第四季度，千方百计地争取提前十天到二十天完成全年国家计划。
    当前新疆工业交通战线上的形势，对提前超额完成全年计划极为有利。到9月底为止，工业总产值已完成全年计划80％以上，九个月完成的产值比去年全年产值总和还多一亿多元。主要工业产品的产量计划，都已完成全年计划的70％到80％。全年生产十二万吨生铁的计划，在9月6日已提前三个多月完成；机械、煤炭、水泥、发电、木材、棉纱等产品，都完成70％以上。原油生产计划今年虽然修订跃进了好几次，到9月底也完成全年计划70％以上。根据9月份原油日产水平计算，11月份即可完成全年采油计划。基本建设和公路运输战线上，也都完成全年计划80％左右。工业产品中的钢和钢材，由于新增加的设备能力投入生产较晚，因而完成计划较差。但是到9月底，全疆投入生产的转炉已达三十二座，生产能力比8月以前实际生产能力增加了好几倍；在钢材生产方面，八一钢铁厂新建年产能力十二万吨的轧钢车间在10月份投入生产。因此，钢和钢材的全年计划仍可提前完成。
    超额完成全年计划的更有利的条件，是工业交通战线上贯彻党的八届八中全会决议以来，生产面貌和职工精神面貌焕然一新。人的主观能动性普遍得到发挥，过去空喊困难的作风一扫而光。干部普遍深入基层，站到困难中去积极解决困难。一个实干、苦干加巧干的轰轰烈烈的增产节约的高潮，已经在各个战线上形成。
    10月初，自治区党委分别部署了工业生产建设和交通运输部门第四季度的任务。目前各厂矿企业正以反右倾为纲，大鼓干劲，发动群众讨论计划，制定措施，掀起一个增产节约的更大高潮。冶金管理局提出要提前十天完成全年钢和钢材生产计划，并且在最近召开第五次炼钢会议，组织了第三个夺钢战役，要求10月份把钢的产量增加两倍。基本建设部门根据集中力量、保证重点的方针，对各项工程进行了排队，正在全力以赴地保证钢铁、机械、石油、煤炭等重点项目提早投入生产。他们提出，要提前一个月完成全年计划，到年底再超额10％。石油工业战线上的职工，正在把夺油大战推向一个新高潮，各矿区都在继续深入反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，决心提前一个半月完成全年采油计划。担负绝大部分原油生产任务的克拉玛依矿区职工，在采取狠抓修井和收油、变低产井为高产井的措施以后，原油日产水平从10月7日以来连续上升。独山子炼油厂在10月5日创造了原油日处理量和轻质油回收率的空前纪录，轻质油回收率达到54.2％，超过了计划指标。交通运输部门在月初召开了电话会议，根据确保钢铁工业原料、机械设备、木材、粮食和市场物资等重点运输任务的方针，布置了第四季度的任务，要求各地深入开展安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里的红旗竞赛运动，提前一个月完成全年运输任务。
    为了满足各个战线上跃进要求，自治区党委最近发出指示，要求全疆立即动员十万人力、三万辆大车、四万头驮畜，担任短途运输任务。
    本报哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省在贯彻党的八中全会精神以来，全省出现了一片大好形势。9月份工业总产值已超过历史上任何一个月，比8月份增长三分之一以上。10月以来，全省一百多万职工进一步展开了轰轰烈烈的学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛运动，掀起了全面大跃进的新高潮。目前，正为提前和超额完成全年计划而奋战。
    中共黑龙江省委认为：黑龙江省实现继续大跃进，在各方面有着极为有利的条件，去年大跃进以来，全省党组织和广大群众取得了实现大跃进的极其丰富的经验，今年大跃进又有了更为雄厚的物质基础，人民公社正在健全地发展，特别是经过贯彻执行八届八中全会反右倾鼓干劲的精神，广大干部和群众热情很高，干劲很大，产量猛升。黑龙江省委同时指出全省实现今年的大跃进，当然也并不是轻而易举的事。因此，要求全省各地进一步认真贯彻执行八届八中全会和省委扩大会的精神，更加广泛深入地开展增产节约运动。
    黑龙江省委提出，今年大跃进中必须充分运用去年大跃进的经验，不仅注重产值产量的增加，还要不断提高产品质量，降低成本和加强设备维修，作到安全生产。在组织今年的大跃进中，还必须为明年的生产作好准备，争取明年第一季度保持今年第四季度的生产水平；农业方面要作好翻地、水利、积肥、种籽、工具和迎接进一步扩大农业机械化的准备工作。在整个国民经济中，要继续贯彻保重点，带全面的要求，加强配合协作，使各方面能在大跃进中协调发展，使全省的增产节约运动能够持续地既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实地不断前进，为1960年大跃进打下良好基础。
    据新华社太原15日电　记者郭活报道：太原市工业、交通运输战线经过反右倾、鼓干劲，大战8、9月，生产跃向了一个新的水平。形势空前良好，已经为提前超额完成全年计划创造了极为有利的条件。
    现在，各工矿企业的广大职工干劲冲天，意气风发，为提前十天到十五天完成全年计划而展开的竞赛运动高潮，正一浪高一浪地前进。继9月份一百九十多个厂矿提前完成第三季度计划后，已有一批先进厂矿、车间和小组提前完成了第四季度和全年计划，大踏步地跨进了1960年。10份以来，全市钢、铁、原煤等几种主要产品上旬的产量，都比9月同期有增长，钢增长6.05％，铁增长20.95％，原煤增长3.41％。
    生产水平迅速全面地增长，是新形势的主要特点。8、9月份以来，全市工业生产就一月超过一月，一旬超过一旬。全市8月份工业总产值比7月份增长16.01％，9月又比8月猛增33.94％，超额26％完成了月计划。1月至9月，全市工业总产值比去年同期增长了56.6％。9月份各种主要产品的产量和8月份比较，钢增长了27.3％，生铁增长了17.7％，钢材增长了30.4％，原煤增长了13.8％，而且都是直线上升。在产量增长的同时，产品质量、成本等各项经济指标也在全面跃进。9月份全市钢和钢材的合格率比8月份提高了27.1％和0.71％，成本续有下降，全市已有十七个工厂提前完成了全年降低成本的计划。据一百六十个工矿企业统计，8月份的劳动生产率比7月份提高15.86％，9月又比8月提高35.06％。
    太原市工业、交通运输战线上出现的这种大好形势，是各个工矿企业认真贯彻党的八届八中全会决议的结果。8月份，当党中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的指示发出后，各工矿企业立即批判了部分干部中滋长的右倾松劲情绪。党的八届八中全会关于提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的伟大号召，更给工业战线上的广大职工带来了巨大的热力。人人扬眉吐气，干劲冲天，不论大工厂小工厂，到处都在誓师比武，表演，评比，作标兵，找对手竞赛运动迅速形成高潮。
    在波澜壮阔的群众性增产节约运动中，共产主义协作之风大盛，而且在过去的基础上有了新的发展和新的创造。各个厂矿企业的竞赛中，有围绕着重点产品开展的“学、赶、帮竞赛”，有“连环赛”、“一条龙协作赛”、组织“志愿军”等，形式之多，规模之大、共产主义风格之高，为历次运动所不及。
    技术革新运动的发展，为厉行增产节约的群众运动增加了丰富的内容。9月份全市实现的技术革新项目就有二万五千多件，其中重大的项目有一千零二十六项。这些建议用于生产后，大大地推进了生产的跃进。
    按照中共太原市委的部署，第四季度各种主要产品的平均日产水平，都比第三季度的实际产量有很大增长。其中，钢增长42％，生铁增长14％，钢材增长26％，原煤增长6.8％。中共太原市委号召全市职工，在第四季度要彻底批判右倾松劲思想和空喊困难的作风，鼓足干劲，采取有力措施，千方百计地把目前已经形成的增产节约运动新高潮推向更高阶段，保证各种主要产品产量逐月稳定上升，力争提前十天到十五天完成全年生产计划，并为明年第一季度生产作好准备。
