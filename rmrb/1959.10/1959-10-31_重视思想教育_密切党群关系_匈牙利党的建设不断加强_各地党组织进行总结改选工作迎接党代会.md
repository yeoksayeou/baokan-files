Budapest Dispatch: The grassroots organizations and district and municipal party committees of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party have been conducting summary and re-election work since September 1st in a very warm political atmosphere. Because the cadres of the grassroots and local party organizations resolutely implemented the party's policies and conscientiously completed the work they were assigned, most of them were re-elected. At the end of this month and the beginning of next month, the party committees of the various states and the capital will successively hold summary and re-election conferences and elect representatives to attend the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

According to reports in "People's Freedom" over the past two months, party members across the country actively participated in the party's summary and re-election meetings, where they summarized and discussed the party's work in detail and formulated future work tasks.

The summaries of the party organizations in various regions and the speeches of party members at the meetings showed that all party members firmly supported the policies implemented by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party over the past three years. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, local party organizations have made great achievements in party building over the past three years. The party organizations, reorganized in the struggle against the counter-revolution, strictly implemented the basic principles of Lenin's intra-party life, strengthened ideological education and organizational discipline, and made the party's unity increasingly close. Although the number of party members is smaller than before the 1956 counter-revolutionary events, the party's combat effectiveness and leading role have been strengthened compared to the past. The party enjoys high prestige among the masses.

Over the past three years, the relationship between the party and the masses has become closer day by day, and the masses trust the party. The working people in factories and rural areas often consult the party's grassroots organizations on problems, and the party organizations often care about helping the masses solve various practical problems. During the summary and re-election process of local party organizations, many non-party members also actively provided many opinions and suggestions to the party organizations. The party organizations in various regions have decided to further strengthen mass work and better unite and lead the broad masses in socialist construction.

Party organizations in various regions have proposed to continue to carry out political education and ideological struggle in depth, continuously improve party members' Marxist-Leninist ideological level, and wage struggle against revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois viewpoints, nationalism, and religious influences, and overcome the remaining influences of sectarianism and dogmatism. Many party organizations have decided to continuously raise the political consciousness of the working people in the process of socialist construction, just as the director of the pharmaceutical factory in the tenth district of Budapest said in his speech at the summary and re-election meeting in this district: "Neglecting political education is a great mistake. No perfect wage system can perfectly solve all production tasks with material incentives."

The summary and re-election meetings also ran through the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined some problems existing in the work, and pointed out the methods of correction. Many party organizations have proposed to prevent complacency and continuously improve their work.

In leading socialist construction, the grassroots and local party organizations have played a significant role. In the period after the 1956 counter-revolutionary events, the revisionists most opposed the party organizations and party members "interfering" in the production of various factories and enterprises, and opposed the party's leadership over production. The party thoroughly refuted this revisionist reactionary view and strengthened its leadership over production. Party members took the lead in driving the masses to actively complete production tasks. In summarizing the work of the past few years, the party organizations pointed out the existing problems based on the production tasks of each unit, further explored the production potential, and formulated specific measures for each unit to accelerate socialist construction.

The Party Central Committee's instructions on the Seventh Party Congress and the Second Five-Year Plan are a great encouragement to all party members and the people of the whole country. The party organizations in various regions have planned their future work and production targets in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee. Party members have expressed their willingness to set an example and drive the masses to actively accelerate the construction of socialism.

    重视思想教育　密切党群关系
    匈牙利党的建设不断加强
    各地党组织进行总结改选工作迎接党代会
    本报布达佩斯30日电　在非常热烈的政治气氛中，匈牙利社会主义工人党的基层组织和各区、市党委会，从9月1日以来，进行了总结改选工作。由于基层和地方党组织的干部坚决贯彻了党的政策，认真完成了他们担任的工作，所以他们大部分又重新当选。本月底和下月初各州和首都的党委会，将先后召开总结改选大会，并选举参加匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会的代表。
    据“人民自由报”近两个月的报道，全国各地的党员都积极参加了党的总结改选会议，在会议上详细地总结和讨论了党的工作，制定了今后的工作任务。
    各地党组织的总结和党员在会议上的发言表明，全体党员都坚决支持社会主义工人党中央委员会三年来所执行的政策。在党中央的正确领导下，三年来地方党组织在党的建设方面取得了很大的成就。在同反革命的斗争中重新组织起来的党组织，严格贯彻了列宁的党内生活的基本原则，加强了思想教育和组织纪律，使党的团结日益紧密。虽然党员的人数比1956年反革命事件前少了，但党的战斗力和领导作用却比以前加强了。党在群众中享有很高的威信。
    三年来，党与群众的关系一天比一天密切，群众信任党。工厂和农村的劳动人民有问题经常向党的基层组织请教，党组织也经常关心地帮助群众解决各种切身问题。在这次地方党组织的总结改选过程中，很多非党人士也主动向党组织提供了很多意见和建议。各地党组织都决定进一步加强群众工作，更好地团结和领导广大群众进行社会主义建设。
    各地党组织都提出要继续深入进行政治教育和思想斗争，不断地提高党员的马克思列宁主义思想水平，同修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级观点民族主义及宗教影响展开斗争，克服宗派主义和教条主义的残余影响。很多党组织决定在社会主义建设过程中，要不断提高劳动人民的政治觉悟，正如布达佩斯第十区制药厂厂长在这个区的总结改选会议上发言时所说的：“忽视政治教育是极大的错误，没有一种十全十美的工资制度，能够以物质鼓励来完美地解决一切生产任务。”
    总结改选会议也贯穿了批评与自我批评的精神，检查了工作中存在的一些问题，指出了改正的方法。很多党组织都提出，要防止自满情绪，不断地改进工作。
    在领导社会主义建设方面，基层和地方党组织发挥了很大的作用。在1956年反革命事件后的一段时期内，修正主义分子最反对党组织和党员“干涉”各工厂企业的生产，反对党领导生产。党彻底驳斥了这种修正主义的反动观点，加强了对生产的领导。党员都以身作则的带动群众积极完成了生产任务。在总结几年来的工作时，党组织都根据各单位的生产任务，指出了目前存在的问题，进一步挖掘了生产潜力，制定了各单位加速社会主义建设的具体措施。
    党中央关于党的第七次代表大会和第二个五年计划的指示，对全体党员和全国人民是一个极大的鼓舞。各地党组织都根据党中央指示，规划了今后的工作和生产指标。党员都纷纷表示要以身作则，带动群众来积极加速社会主义的建设。
