Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th—A million Cubans from across the country held a massive demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace and surrounding areas today, angrily protesting the air raids against Cuba carried out by counter-revolutionaries led by Díaz Lanz from the United States with American connivance, and expressing their support for the government's severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

　　Tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded around the Presidential Palace Square, holding up placards, unanimously condemning foreign aggression and demanding the arming of workers and the thorough purging of counter-revolutionary criminals.

　　Prime Minister Castro delivered a speech at the mass rally, strongly condemning the United States for shamelessly allowing counter-revolutionaries to use its bases to send aircraft to invade Cuba. He said that the reason for this aggression was that the Cuban revolution had violated the interests and privileges of monopoly organizations, so they instigated counter-revolutionaries to invade Cuba.

　　Castro emphasized that a revolutionary nation that has stood up cannot be intimidated by any force or anyone, and anyone who attempts to seize Cuba will only receive the dust of Cuban soil soaked in blood. He expressed that Cuba will surely defeat those who attempt to destroy the revolution.

　　Castro spoke of the pressure exerted by the United States to obstruct Britain from selling defense supplies to Cuba, saying that if Britain does not sell aircraft to Cuba, the revolutionary government will go to wherever they are sold to buy them. If there is no money to buy these aircraft, the people will contribute.

　　At the rally, the Prime Minister handed over his and the President's salaries to Air Force Commander Almeida as part of the people's contribution to purchase aircraft.

　　Castro stated that Cuba's land reform will be carried out more vigorously than ever before. He also announced that the government will soon promulgate petroleum and mining laws that will affect foreign interest groups.

　　Castro exposed the conspiracies of the traitors of the revolution who, under the guise of anti-communism, were engaged in opposing the Cuban revolution. He said that they were using accusations of communism to oppose the Cuban regime because this excuse suited the monopoly groups' plans to invade Cuba.

　　When Castro asked the people to decide whether revolutionary tribunals should be reopened to try war criminals, the million people attending the rally immediately raised their hands in approval and let out cheers that resounded through the sky. The Prime Minister then announced that, in order to implement this decision, the cabinet would promulgate a law tomorrow to restore the revolutionary tribunals.

　　Castro asked the people to decide whether the invaders, the personnel who fly aircraft to bomb and strafe, the terrorists, and the traitors like the arrested traitor Hubert Matos should be shot. The masses unanimously gave the Prime Minister an affirmative answer.

　　Castro also announced that military training will be immediately conducted for farmers, workers, and all the people. He said that the people are ready to fight to defend their rights.

　　Cuban President Dorticós and other prominent revolutionary leaders also spoke at the meeting. President Dorticós said that Cubans are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend Cuba's freedom for their descendants.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th—The United States' connivance with Cuban counter-revolutionaries using its bases to send aircraft to raid Cuba has aroused condemnation from worker groups and political figures in Ecuador, Guatemala, Chile, and Brazil.

　　Ecuador's "La Tierra" newspaper published an editorial yesterday entitled "We Must Defend the Cuban Revolution," saying that the people of Latin American countries "cannot tolerate the imperialist claws returning to harm a country that is the hope and mirror of the majority of people on the entire continent." The newspaper also condemned the propaganda campaign by "international trusts" against the Cuban revolution. "La Tierra" pointed out that all this shows the imperialists' delusion to prevent Cuba's land reform and its economic development and independence.

　　Workers, students, and writers in Guatemala recently established the "Committee for the Protection of Cuban Sovereignty" in order to continue a movement in support of Cuba. The Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala wrote to Cuban Prime Minister Castro and the Cuban Workers' Confederation, expressing "the support of the Guatemalan working class for the Cuban revolution." The organization also wrote to the United Nations and the Organization of American States, expressing "protest against the air raids carried out against Cuba from abroad in recent days." The Guatemalan Patriotic Committee of Graphic Workers also issued a statement condemning the "piratical" attacks "taking off unhindered from American airports." The statement said that the laborers and people of Guatemala "have suffered the bombing and strafing of American pirate planes. We cannot but feel extreme hatred and contempt for the traitors and executioners of our people." The Chilean Unified Workers' Union telegraphed the Cuban Workers' Confederation, expressing support for the Cuban people's struggle.

　　Brazilian Republican Party leader Elio Ramos, Christian Democratic Party leader Paulo de Tarso, and others have all expressed their support for Cuba. Nationalists parliamentary front leader Mário Gonzaga Vives condemned "(the US) State Department's attempt to rebuild Batista's or other puppets' dictatorships" because the establishment of the Cuban revolutionary regime was a "fatal blow to the trusts that plunder Latin America."

　　More than 400 Dominican and Nicaraguan exiles in New York held a demonstration in front of the United Nations building on the afternoon of the 25th, holding up placards condemning the aggression against Cuba and protesting the American authorities' protection of war criminals.

    古巴百万人示威抗议美国挑衅
    卡斯特罗宣布恢复革命法庭实行全民军训
    拉丁美洲公众舆论声援古巴人民保卫革命
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　来自全国各地的一百万古巴人民今天在总统府前及其附近地区举行了巨大的示威集会，他们愤怒地抗议反革命分子迪亚斯·兰斯在美国纵容下从美国派遣飞机对古巴进行的空袭，并且表示支持政府对反革命分子实行严厉的镇压。
    拥挤在总统府广场周围的成千成万的示威者高举着标语牌，他们一致谴责外国的侵略，要求武装工人和彻底肃清反革命罪犯。
    卡斯特罗总理在群众集会上发表了演说，他强烈地谴责美国无耻地允许反革命分子利用它的基地派遣飞机侵入古巴。他说：之所以出现这种侵略行为，是因为古巴革命触犯了垄断组织的利益和特权，于是他们就嗾使反革命分子对古巴进行侵略。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，站起来的革命的民族是任何力量、任何人也吓不倒的，谁要企图强占古巴，他得到的将是浸透鲜血的古巴土地上的灰尘。他表示，古巴必将战胜那些企图摧毁革命的人。
    卡斯特罗谈到美国在阻挠英国向古巴出卖国防用品所施加的压力时说，假如英国不卖飞机给古巴，革命政府将到卖给它的地方去购买。假如没有购买这些飞机的钱，人民会拿出来。
    总理在集会上把他自己和总统的薪金交给空军司令阿尔梅达，作为人民献机捐款的一部分。
    卡斯特罗表示，古巴的土地改革将比以往任何时候更有力地进行下去。他还宣布：政府即将颁布触动外国利益集团的石油法和矿业法。
    卡斯特罗戳穿了革命的叛徒打着反共的招牌，从事反对古巴革命的阴谋。他说，他们利用对共产主义的指责来反对古巴的政权，因为这种借口适合于垄断集团准备侵略古巴的计划。
    当卡斯特罗要人民决定是否应该重开革命法庭来审判战犯时，参加集会的一百万人立即举起双手表示赞成。并且发出了响彻云霄的欢呼声。总理接着宣布：为了执行这一决定，内阁将在明天颁布恢复革命法庭的法律。
    卡斯特罗要求人民决定：是否应该枪毙那些入侵者、驾驶飞机进行轰炸和扫射的人员、恐怖分子和像已被逮捕的叛徒乌维尔特·马托斯这样的叛徒。群众一致给了总理肯定的回答。
    卡斯特罗还宣布，将立即对农民、工人和全体人民进行军事训练。他说，人民已经作好准备，为捍卫自己的权利而战。
    古巴总统多尔蒂科斯和其他一些著名的革命领袖也在大会上讲了话。总统多尔蒂科斯说，古巴人准备以牺牲生命来为自己的后代保卫古巴的自由。
    据新华社哈瓦那26日电　美国纵容古巴的反革命分子利用它的基地派遣飞机空袭古巴的罪行，引起厄瓜多尔、危地马拉、智利和巴西的工人团体和政界人士的谴责。
    厄瓜多尔“大地报”昨天以“我们要保卫古巴革命”为题发表的社论说：拉丁美洲各国人民“不能容忍帝国主义的魔爪重新来危害作为整个大陆大多数人民的希望和镜子的国家”。这家报纸还谴责“国际托辣斯”反对古巴革命的宣传运动。“大地报”指出：这一切表示了帝国主义阻止古巴土地改革及其经济发展和独立的妄想。
    危地马拉的工人、学生和作家最近成立了“维护古巴主权委员会”，以便继续开展一个支持古巴的运动。危地马拉工会自治联合会写信给古巴总理卡斯特罗及古巴工人联合会，表示“危地马拉工人阶级支持古巴革命”。这个组织还写信给联合国和美洲国家组织，表示“抗议最近几天来从国外对古巴所进行的空袭”。危地马拉图片工人爱国委员会也发表声明，谴责“从美国机场毫无阻碍地起飞的海盗式的”袭击。声明说：危地马拉的劳动者和人民“曾经遭受过美国海盗飞机的轰炸和扫射。我们不能不对我们各国人民的叛徒和刽子手感到十分憎恨和蔑视”。智利工人统一工会打电报给古巴工人联合会，表示支持古巴人民的斗争。
    巴西共和党领导人埃利奥·拉莫斯、基督教民主党领导人保罗·德塔罗斯等人一致表示支持古巴。民族主义者议会阵线领导人、马里奥·冈萨贡维斯谴责“（美国）国务院企图重建巴蒂斯塔或其他傀儡的独裁统治”，因为古巴革命政权的建立是对“掠夺拉丁美洲的托辣斯的致命打击”。
    在约纽的四百多名多米尼加和尼加拉瓜的流亡者，在25日下午高举着谴责侵略古巴和抗议美国当局庇护战犯的标语牌，在联合国大厦前举行了示威游行。
