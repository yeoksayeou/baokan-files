    Ahead, and Further Ahead
    Li Fu
    Opening the newspaper, a flood of news about early completion of production plans makes one's heart bloom with joy.

    Guizhou Province overfulfilled its annual steel production target three months ahead of schedule; Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant completed its annual total output value ahead of schedule. Zhejiang completed its production plans for twelve kinds of chemical products ahead of schedule this year...

    Ahead of schedule! What an exciting phrase! It shortens the historical process and strengthens the confidence in the Great Leap Forward.

    In the past, some people believed that industrial production was high before festivals and low after festivals, high at the end of the month and low at the beginning of the month, high in the fourth quarter and low in the first quarter. It seemed that production could not increase until the fourth quarter or the end of the month. However, the news published in yesterday's newspaper changed this "rule." On October 1st, the production of many factories and mines exceeded the daily production level of September, and many factories and mines created new production records. Today's news broke with past conventions, and many factories and mines, after completing their annual plans three months ahead of schedule, are marching towards new combat goals.

    One after another, situations of early completion of tasks on the production front reflect how much tremendous power the Party's thought of opposing right-leaning and boosting morale brings to production. It is people who make things happen; objective laws are not completely unchangeable, and people are not powerless in the face of objective laws. Before May 1, 1958, Guizhou Province did not produce a single pound of steel and was a "blank sheet." After May 1st, the Guiyang Central Foundry only produced 300 kilograms of low-carbon steel using self-made small "monkey" furnaces. Since the Great Leap Forward, Guizhou's daily steel production has ended its history of being calculated in kilograms. Now, they are no longer calculating in kilograms, but in hundreds or several hundred tons. The situation a year ago has long become a historical relic and has been replaced by new laws. In July of this year, their daily output was only 130 tons, but in early and mid-September, it increased by one times. What a high speed that is!

    Since the Great Leap Forward, people are grasping objective laws and exploring the laws of building socialism at high speed. By conscientiously implementing the Party's General Line, thoroughly implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and deeply boosting morale and opposing right-leaning tendencies, we can not only complete this year's plan, but also complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

    The situation before us is extremely good, and the tasks before us are also very arduous. We respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, not to simply complete the plan, but to be ahead, and further ahead!

    提前再提前
    黎夫
    打开报纸，一片提前完成生产计划的消息使人心花喜放。
    贵州省提前三个月超额完成全年钢产任务；洛阳矿山机器厂提前完成全年总产值。浙江十二种化工产品提前完成今年生产计划……。
    提前，是多么引人兴奋的字眼呀！它，缩短了历史进程，增强了跃进的信心。
    过去有人认为，工业生产节前高、节后低，月末高、月初低，第四季度高、第一季度低，这样一个高峰接一个低峰，似乎不到四季度、不到月底生产总是上不去。可是，昨天报上发表的消息却改变了这个“规律”。多少厂矿10月1日的生产超过了9月的日产水平，多少厂矿创造了生产新纪录，今天的消息，打破了历来常规，多少厂矿提前三个月完成了全年计划以后，又向新的战斗目标迈进。
    生产战线上一个又一个提前完成任务的情况，反映了党的反右倾鼓干劲的思想给生产带来多么巨大的力量。事在人为，客观规律并不是完全不可改变的，人们在客观规律面前并不是无能为力的。贵州在1958年5月1日以前，不产一斤钢，是一张“白纸”。5月1日以后贵阳中心铸造厂，用自造的小猴子炉才生产出三百公斤低碳钢。大跃进以来，贵州钢的日产量才结束了以公斤计算的历史。现在，他们不再是按公斤计算，而是用百吨或几百吨来计算了。一年以前的情况，早已变成历史遗迹而为新的规律代替了。今年7月，他们的日产量不过一百三十吨，而9月上旬和中旬却猛增一倍。这是多么高的速度。
    大跃进以来，人们正在掌握客观法则摸索到高速度建设社会主义的规律。认真地执行了党的总路线，认真地贯彻了党的八中全会的决议，深入地鼓足干劲反对右倾，不仅能够完成今年的计划，而且完全可以在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划。
    摆在我们面前的形势极为良好，摆在我们面前的任务也很艰巨，我们响应党中央号召，不是一般的完成计划，而是要提前、提前再提前！
