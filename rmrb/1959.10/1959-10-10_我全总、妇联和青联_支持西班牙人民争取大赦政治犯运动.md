Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said today: "Chinese workers resolutely support the Spanish people's movement against dictatorial rule, to restore all democratic freedoms, and to demand amnesty for political prisoners."

The person in charge said: "We believe that the struggle of the Spanish people is just. Although the Spanish Civil War ended twenty years ago, there are still 200,000 patriots suffering in the prisons of the Franco regime; tens of thousands of patriots have been forced into exile, and even the Spanish workers' own organization, the 'General Union of Spanish Workers,' has been declared illegal. Such wanton destruction of democracy and freedom by the Spanish authorities is intolerable to anyone.

"On June 18 this year, a peaceful general strike was held throughout Spain, demanding that the government change the above-mentioned reactionary practices. However, the authorities have instead adopted more cruel means of suppression to deal with the unarmed people, arresting a large number of striking workers and democratic progressives, including the well-known member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, Simon Sanchez Montero, and sentencing Montero to twenty years in prison. On July 28, the parliament was forced to pass the 'Social Order Law,' which allows the police to arbitrarily arrest striking workers and the army to 'rectify order' everywhere, further subjecting the Spanish people to a dark and hopeless rule.

"For justice, to oppose fascist suppression, and for peace in Europe and the world, we firmly support the current just struggle of the Spanish people; resolutely protest against the persecution of workers and people by the Spanish authorities; and resolutely demand that the Spanish authorities immediately grant amnesty to political prisoners imprisoned and exiled abroad."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today, firmly supporting the Spanish people's movement to seek amnesty for political prisoners.

The statement of the All-China Women's Federation said: "All Chinese women express great sympathy and firm support for the just struggle of the Spanish people to restore all democratic freedoms and to amnesty imprisoned and exiled political prisoners. This struggle of the Spanish people shows that the cruel persecution of kind people who have contributed to the people's freedom and happiness by the Franco government for a long time is not only resolutely opposed by the Spanish people and all fair-minded people in the world, but also shows that Spain's democratic forces cannot be eliminated by any persecution. Chinese women firmly support the just demand of the Spanish people to seek amnesty for all political prisoners imprisoned and exiled."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The person in charge of the All-China Youth Federation said today that Chinese youth warmly support the just movement launched by the Spanish Communist Party and other democratic forces not long ago to strive for "amnesty for all political prisoners imprisoned and exiled."

The person in charge said: "Today, twenty years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, at a time when the world peace movement and the national liberation movement are developing so strongly, the fact that thousands of political prisoners are still imprisoned in the prisons of the Franco regime, and thousands of Spanish patriots are still forced to live in exile for many years and cannot return to their own country, is something that Chinese youth find completely intolerable.

"What is even more infuriating is that these political prisoners have been subjected to inhuman persecution simply because they have selflessly contributed their efforts to the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Spanish people. Recently, the Franco government, ignoring the strong demands of the broad masses of people at home and abroad for amnesty for political prisoners and exiles, has continued to carry out frenzied persecution of domestic democratic forces. We express our utmost indignation at this. I, on behalf of the 130 million young people of the country, express our deepest sympathy and support for the Spanish people's movement to seek amnesty for political prisoners, and resolutely demand that the Franco government grant amnesty to all political prisoners imprisoned and exiled."

    我全总、妇联和青联
    支持西班牙人民争取大赦政治犯运动
    新华社9日讯　中华全国总工会负责人今天发表谈话说：“中国工人坚决支持西班牙人民反对独裁统治、争取恢复一切民主自由权利、要求大赦政治犯的运动。”
    负责人说：“我们认为，西班牙人民这一斗争是正义的。尽管西班牙内战已经结束了二十年，但佛朗哥政权的监狱里还有二十万爱国者在受着折磨；成千上万的爱国者被迫流亡国外，连西班牙工人自己的组织——‘西班牙工会总联合会’也被宣布为非法。西班牙当局这种对民主自由的肆意摧残，是任何人所不能容忍的。
    “今年6月18日，西班牙全国举行了和平总罢工，要求政府改变上述反动的做法。但当局反而采取了更加残酷的镇压手段来对付手无寸铁的人民。大批逮捕罢工的工人和民主进步分子，包括著名的西班牙共产党中央政治局委员西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗，并将蒙特罗判处了二十年徒刑。7月28日，又强迫议会通过了‘社会秩序法’，使警察可以任意逮捕罢工工人，军队有权到处‘整顿秩序’。使西班牙人民进一步受到暗无天日的统治。
    “为了正义，为了反对法西斯镇压，为了欧洲和世界和平，我们坚决支持西班牙人民当前的正义斗争；坚决抗议西班牙当局对工人和人民的迫害；坚决要求西班牙当局立即大赦被关在监狱和流亡在国外的政治犯。”
    新华社9日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天发表声明，坚决支持西班牙人民争取大赦政治犯的运动。
    全国妇联的声明说：“全中国妇女对西班牙人民争取恢复一切民主自由权利、大赦被囚禁的和流亡在外的政治犯的正义斗争表示极大的同情和坚决支持。西班牙人民的这一斗争，说明了佛朗哥政府对为争取人民的自由和幸福贡献力量的善良人士长期以来所进行的残酷的迫害，不仅是西班牙人民和全世界公正人士坚决反对的，同时也说明了，西班牙的民主力量是任何迫害都消灭不了的。中国妇女坚决支持西班牙人民争取大赦被监禁和流亡在外的全体政治犯的正义要求。”
    新华社9日讯　中华全国青年联合会负责人今天发表谈话说，中国青年热烈支持西班牙共产党和其他民主力量在不久前发起的争取
  “大赦所有被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯”的正义运动。
    负责人说：“在西班牙内战结束二十年以后的今天，在世界和平运动和民族解放运动如此壮大发展的今天，在佛朗哥政权的监狱里，仍然囚禁着成千上万的政治犯，数以千计的西班牙爱国者仍然被迫长年流亡国外，不能回到自己的祖国，中国青年认为这是十分不能令人容忍的事情。
    “更加使人愤慨的是，这些政治犯之所以遭到惨无人道的迫害，只是因为他们为争取西班牙人民的独立、自由和幸福而奋不顾身地贡献过自己的力量。最近佛朗哥政府不顾国内外广大人民要求大赦政治犯和流亡者的强烈呼声，仍然继续对国内民主力量进行疯狂的迫害。对此，我们表示无比的愤慨。我谨代表全国一亿三千万青年对西班牙人民争取大赦政治犯的运动表示最深切的同情和支持，并坚决要求佛朗哥政府大赦被监禁和流亡在外的全体政治犯。”
