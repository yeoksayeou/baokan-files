The joyous mood of the tenth anniversary celebrations still stirs within us, and the joyful scenes still linger before our eyes. Looking around: the motherland is thriving, the situation is very good, very good, very good! The high tide of the mass movement is surging, and the voices are rising day by day.

The working class sings the most powerful tune. With a cry of "Good Start to the Month!", the red arrows of steel, coal, and other major industrial products are all leaping in a straight line. Daily output rises every ten days, reaching new heights every step of the way. The steel army held a competition and appraisal meeting before National Day. More than a hundred units had red flags of increased production flying. In June, the daily output was only over 30,000 tons, but now the 50,000-ton mark has been broken.

The heroes on the industrial, mining, financial, and trade fronts are preparing to send good news to the "Meeting of Heroes." Tens of thousands of heroes are now even more energetic, adding fuel to the fire.

The mass movement on the industrial front has a completely new look: higher output, better quality, lower consumption of materials, and better safety. This is called: larger scale, higher enthusiasm, more solid footing, and better order. As the saying goes, "fierce but not chaotic," just like icing on the cake, everything is good.

This year, we adjusted the industrial production targets. We said we would strive to complete these new targets ahead of schedule and exceed them! But the Western masters said: Maybe not, maybe not, you think too highly of yourselves! This year is your "darkest year," "falling headfirst." People with right-leaning sentiments also shook their heads greatly: Hmm, hmm? Oh, oh? They didn't say it, but they sneered inwardly. Only two months have passed, and we can't help but laugh out loud: Listen, you self-righteous people: completing ahead of schedule is certain, and exceeding the target will definitely be done. We must work harder and free up some hands to do a better job of preparing for next year, so that next year! Will have an even greater leap forward. We want to have a "Good Start to the Month!" every month, so that the flowers of industrial production will bloom at the beginning of the month, the beginning of the season, and the beginning of the year, as well as they do at the end of the month, the end of the season, and the end of the year.

In the vast fields, the spirit of fighting for the three autumn harvests is high. Look: the fruits are abundant, the joy of harvest is always on their faces. The summer grain harvest was a great success; the quality of the early autumn harvest is even better than the summer grain; people are now blooming with joy to seize an even greater late autumn harvest, and the high-yield movement is carried out like a raging fire and a surging tide. Autumn plowing and autumn planting make people feel excited, their enthusiasm is even higher, and they vow to be better next year than this year.

Pouring cold water did not discourage us, and major disasters did not make us fall. Some people, like witches, chanted spells to make our people's communes retreat, retreat, retreat; some people wanted to strike our collective canteens with lightning, and others wanted to use the wind to blow down our canteens. Now the clouds have cleared, and the witch has fallen flat on her face. The people's communes are not "dead in name only," but are down-to-earth, standing tall with chests out, able to compare with the sky. The collective canteens are getting better and better, and the working people cannot do without them. The rural labor force has increased, the attendance rate has increased, and the cultivated area has also expanded. It is evident that this year: grain, cotton, and oil crops will all exceed the targets. Looking forward to next year! Good news has already been heard: we will carry out agricultural mechanization, and industry will protect agriculture.

The situation in the market is getting better and better. The variety of commodities has increased, the amount of goods on the market has increased, the sales volume has increased, and the inventory has also increased. The gap between the amount of commodities and purchasing power has narrowed, with a long and continuous flow, who does not rejoice. The service industry has a new look, who does not praise its convenience!

Of all the good things, nothing is better than the leap in people's spirits. In the realm of people's spirits, there is vitality, energy like a tide, the songs of the Great Leap Forward shake the nine heavens, 600 million people release their enthusiasm, and their ideological awareness is greatly improved. Having seen the great ocean, other water is hard to appreciate, what things and what forces in the world can hinder it?

The situation is infinitely good, the high tide rises day by day; to find the root cause, it is the Party's good leadership. The banner of the General Line is raised high, and the people's communes are walking on the bright road. We must muster our energy, strive for the upstream, firmly grasp the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, and leap forward bravely together! This winter, we will laugh even better!

    形势无限好
    葛德
    十年大庆的欢乐情绪还在内心激荡，欢乐景象还在眼前缭绕。放眼看：祖国大地欣欣向荣，光景是很好，很好，很好！群众运动的高潮来势汹涌，声浪日日高。
    工人阶级唱出最强力的曲调。一声“开门红”，钢、煤和其他主要工业产品的红色箭头，都在直线上跃。日产量旬旬上升，节节拔高。钢铁大军在国庆节前开过评比会。一百多个单位，增产的红旗飘飘。6月间日产量还不过三万多吨，如今是五万吨的大关都被冲破了。
    工矿财贸战线上的英雄们，正准备向“群英会”送捷报。数以万计的英雄们，如今更精神抖擞，火上把油浇。
    工业战线上的群众运动出现全新面貌：产量更高，质量更好，耗材更低，安全更好。这就叫，规模更大，热气更高，踏脚更实，秩序更好。有道是“猛而不乱”，恰似那锦上添花，面面都好。
    今年我们调整过工业生产的指标。我们说要争取提前和超额完成这新的指标！西方老爷们却说：未必，未必，你们想得倒好！今年是你们“最暗淡的年份”，“头朝下往下倒”。右倾情绪的人也大为摇头：嗯，嗯？噢，噢？口不说，心里冷笑。时间不过两个多月，我们不禁放声哈哈大笑：听着，自作聪明的人们：提前是肯定的了，超额也一定办到。我们还要再努一把力，腾出一点儿手来，把明年的准备工作做得更好，使明年啊！要有一个更大的飞跃。我们要月月都来“开门红”，要使工业生产之花，在月初，季初，年初，开得像月末、季末，年末一样好。
    辽阔田野上，奋战三秋气正高。你看啊：果实累累，丰收喜悦，终日挂眉梢。夏粮大丰收；早秋的成色比夏粮更好；人们正在心花怒放地夺取晚秋更大丰收，高产运动开展得如火如荼如浪如潮。秋耕秋种使得人们心情振奋，热劲更高，誓要明年比今年更好。
    泼冷水没有使我们泄气，大灾害没有使我们跌倒。有人曾像巫婆一样的掐诀念咒要我们的人民公社退退退；有人曾想雷打我们的集体食堂，还有人想用风把我们的食堂吹倒。如今云散烟消，巫婆子仰面朝天摔大跤。人民公社并没有“名存实亡”，而是脚踏实地，高挺胸伸展腰，能与天比高。集体食堂越办越好，劳动人民离它不了。农村劳动力有了增加，出勤率有了增高，耕地面积也扩展了。眼见得今年啊：粮食、棉花、油料，都要超过指标。展望来年啊！喜讯已经听到：要开展农业方面的机械化，工业要把农业保。
    市场上光景越来越好。商品品种增加了，上市量也增加了，销售量增加了，库存量也增加了。商品量与购买力的差距已经缩小，源远流长，谁不欢笑。服务行业有新貌，谁不称便道好！
    千好万好，好不过人们精神上的飞跃。在人们的精神领域里，生机勃发，干劲如潮，跃进之歌震九霄，六亿人热情大奔放，思想觉悟大提高。曾经沧海难为水，世界上能找到什么东西，什么力量来把它阻挠。
    形势无限好，高潮日日高；要把根源找，党的好领导。总路线的旗帜扬的高，人民公社走的阳关道。干劲要鼓足，上游要争到，多、快、好、省把握牢，勇往直前齐飞跃！要今冬啊，我们笑得更好！
