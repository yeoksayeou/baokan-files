    Soviet Scientists Name Mountains and "Seas" on the Far Side of the Moon
    The image below shows a photograph of the far side of the moon:
    After preliminary processing of the photographs received from the automatic interplanetary station, the distribution of features on the far side of the moon, which is not visible from Earth, is as follows: 1. A large ringed "sea" with a diameter of 300 kilometers - the Sea of Moscow; 2. Cosmonaut Bay in the Sea of Moscow; 3. The continuation of the Sea of South on the far side of the moon; 4. The Tsiolkovsky ringed mountain with a central hill; 5. The Lomonosov ringed mountain with a central hill; 6. The Joliot-Curie ringed mountain; 7. The Soviet Mountain Range; 8. The Sea of Dreams. The solid line across the image is the lunar equator, and the dashed line is the boundary between the visible and invisible parts of the moon from Earth. The features circled with solid lines are those that can be identified after preliminary processing; the features circled with dashed lines are those whose shapes need to be determined; the features surrounded by dots are being classified; further processing of the received photographs is underway in other areas. The features in the visible part of the moon are marked with Roman numerals: Ⅰ Sea of Humboldt; Ⅱ Sea of Crisis; Ⅲ Marginal Sea; Ⅳ Sea of Waves; Ⅴ Smith's Sea; Ⅵ Sea of Fertility; Ⅶ Sea of South.

    苏联科学家为月球背面山“海”命名
    下图为月球背面照片：
    从自动行星际站上收到的照片经过初步整理后，表明了地球上看不到的月球背面上实体的分布情况如下：1、直径为三百公里的大寰形海——莫斯科海；2、莫斯科海中的宇宙航行家湾；3、南海在月球背面的延续；4、有中央丘的齐奥尔科夫斯基寰形山；5、有中央丘的罗蒙诺索夫寰形山；6、约里奥—居里寰形山；7、苏维埃山系；8、理想海。横过图面的实线是月球赤道，虚线是从地球上看得见和看不见的月球两个部分的界线。用实线画圈的是经过初步整理后可以确定的实体；用虚线画圈的是须要确定形状的实体；用点围绕的实体正在分类；在其他部分正在对收到的照片进行进一步整理。用罗马字母标明的是月球可见部分的实体：Ⅰ洪保德海；Ⅱ危海；Ⅲ边区海；Ⅳ浪海；Ⅴ史密斯海；Ⅵ丰富海；Ⅶ南海。塔斯社传真照片（新华社发）（附图片）
