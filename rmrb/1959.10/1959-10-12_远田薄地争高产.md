　　The Xiaodian People's Commune in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, is strengthening the cultivation and management of distant and barren lands, striving to cultivate each plot well and achieve a bumper harvest on every mu.

　　This year, distant and barren lands account for 35% of the wheat fields sown in the Xiaodian Commune. In the past, due to the practice of extensive planting and low harvesting on distant and barren lands, yields were often several times lower than those of good and nearby lands. The reasons for the low yield of distant and barren lands, in addition to the poor natural conditions, are mainly: poor planting, shallow plowing with little fertilizer, sparse planting and broadcasting, sowing on unplowed land, and poor management.

　　Based on the above situation, the Commune Party Committee started by addressing ideological issues, organizing cadres and commune members to calculate accounts, make comparisons, and conduct debates. Among the commune's 109,000 mu of wheat fields, 30,000 mu are distant and barren lands. If cultivation and management are strengthened, each mu can yield at least 90 jin more, and the commune can harvest more than 2.7 million jin of grain, equivalent to 47% of last year's total summer output. The Xiaodian Brigade cited an example in the debate: the Liugang Production Team's 50 mu of distant and infertile land achieved an average yield of 136 jin per mu due to good planting and management, approaching the yield of good land; while the Huiying Production Team's 30 mu of distant land yielded only enough for seeds due to poor planting and management. Through comparison, commune members realized the principles of "success in farming depends on human effort" and "one point of effort yields one point of harvest." Based on this increased understanding, the commune adopted measures to vigorously strengthen the cultivation and management of distant and barren lands: (1) Fully implement the "three guarantees contract" of "guaranteed tasks, guaranteed time, and guaranteed output," to further implement production tasks and ensure that good and bad fields, distant and nearby fields are all cultivated and managed well; (2) Ensure that distant fields receive the same amount of base fertilizer, adopting methods such as applying fine fertilizer to distant fields, coarse fertilizer to nearby fields, accumulating fertilizer locally, and applying fertilizer to distant fields in advance, requiring 300 dan of coarse fertilizer or 25 dan of fine fertilizer per mu; (3) Plant distant fields before nearby fields. Based on the characteristics of distant fields such as poor soil fertility, slow growth, and weak seedlings, sowing should be appropriately advanced to increase the growing period and strengthen resistance to frost, promoting early maturity in distant fields. (4) Organize professional teams to carry out mutual cooperation and support teams with more distant land and insufficient manpower and animal power; (5) Adjust contracting work and labor quotas according to the labor intensity of distant fields, so as to achieve more pay for more work. After adopting the above measures, cadres and the masses began to pay attention to the cultivation of distant and barren lands. The Maji Brigade originally planned to use all 1,200 mu of distant land for spring crops, but now it has decided to convert all of it to autumn planting, organizing forces for a concentrated plowing effort. The Xiaodian Brigade had 800 mu of distant land that was originally plowed only once, but now all of it is plowed twice, determined to change the habit of sowing on unplowed land.

　　远田薄地争高产
    安徽寿县小甸人民公社加强远田薄地的耕作管理，力争块块种好，亩亩丰收。
    小甸公社今年秋种麦田中远田薄地面积占35％。由于过去对远田薄地采用广种薄收方法耕作，因而产量往往比好田近田要少几成。造成远田薄地低产的原因，除自然条件较差外，主要是：种的差，浅耕肥少，稀植撒播，白田播种，管理差。
    公社党委根据以上情况，从解决思想问题入手，组织干部和社员算账、对比，开展辩论。全社十万九千亩麦田中三万亩是远田薄地，如果加强耕作管理，每亩至少可多收九十斤，全社就可多收粮食二百七十多万斤，相当于去年夏季总产量的47％。小甸大队在辩论中举例：刘岗生产队五十亩远田瘦田，由于种得好管理得好，结果每亩平均产量达到一百三十六斤，接近好田产量；而回郢生产队三十多亩远田，由于种和管理差，收成只够种子。经过对比，使社员认识到“种地在人”、“一分功夫一分收成”的道理。在认识提高的基础上，公社采取措施，大力加强远田薄地的耕作管理工作：（一）全面推行“包任务、包时间、包产量”的三包合同，使生产任务进一步落实，保证将好田坏田、远田近田一齐种好管好；（二）保证远田同样施足基肥，采取远田施细肥、近田施粗肥、就地积造、远田肥料提前下田等办法，要求每亩施粗肥三百担或细肥二十五担；（三）先种远田后种近田。根据远田地力薄、生长慢、苗弱等特点，适当提早播种，增加生长期和加强抗霜冻能力，促使远田早熟。（四）组织专业队，开展相互协作，支援远地多、人畜力不足的队；（五）根据远田费工的程度调整包工和劳动定额，作到多劳多得。采取以上措施后，干部和群众开始重视了远田薄地的耕作。马集大队原先计划把一千二百多亩远田全部作春茬田，现决定全部改为秋种，组织力量进行突击翻犁。小甸大队有八百亩远田原来只犁一交，现都犁两交，决心改变白田下种习惯。
