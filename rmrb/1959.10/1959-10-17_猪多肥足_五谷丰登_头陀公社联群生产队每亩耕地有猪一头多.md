More Pigs, More Manure, Abundant Harvests
    Lianqun Production Team of Toutuo Commune Has More Than One Pig Per Mu of Cultivated Land

    According to a report in the Zhejiang Daily, the Lianqun Production Team of Toutuo People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, resolutely implements the production policy of taking grain as the key link and combining grain and livestock. Pig raising has developed by leaps and bounds. The production team now raises 1,429 pigs (and also 138 head of cattle and 1,768 poultry). The team has 1,247 mu of land, averaging 1.14 pigs per mu; the team has 237 households, averaging 6.02 pigs per household.

    Because of the large number of pigs, a large amount of fertilizer has been accumulated, which has promoted increased agricultural production. From October last year to July this year, the team accumulated a total of 56,000 dan of pen manure, an average of 45 dan per mu, more than double the amount of fertilizer applied in the same period last year. This year, the yield per mu of spring grain in the team increased by 63.8% compared with last year; the early rice increased by 40.4% compared with last year, and there were also 16 mu of early rice fields yielding 1,000 jin. Due to the accumulation of more pen manure, the expenditure on commercial fertilizer was reduced, and the agricultural cost also decreased from 32% of the total income last year to 22%.

    With the development of grain and livestock production, the income of the commune members has also greatly increased, and their lives have generally improved. According to the preliminary distribution of the summer harvest, the income of every commune member has increased, and the total public accumulation of the team is more than 8,000 yuan. The average deposit per commune member household is 62 yuan and 84 fen. In the first half of this year, 200 pigs were sold to the state, overfulfilling the task.

    The Zipuyang area where this team is located was a dead field before liberation. There were no rivers, the soil was barren, and it was prone to both floods and droughts. Harvests were poor nine years out of ten, and the yield per mu of grain was only about 200 jin. Sometimes there was no harvest at all, and the people lived in extreme poverty. Every year, about 30% of the people went out to work or beg for food. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the masses of Zipuyang built water conservancy projects year after year. By the spring of 1955, the team had dug a large river and seven small ditches, and built two large sluice gates. The problem of farmland water conservancy had been basically solved. After a large area was converted to double-cropping rice, the demand for fertilizer increased by about one time compared with the past. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, the Party branch led the masses to carry out a manure accumulation campaign centered on raising pigs. In March last year, deputy captain Yuan Genfu and others went out to purchase piglets. In a short period of three or four months, the number of publicly raised pigs in the team increased from more than 100 to 206 (including 28 sows). After communization, thanks to the strong support of the commune, the number of sows rapidly increased from 28 to 342. The number of meat pigs increased rapidly, and there are currently 1,429 pigs being raised, of which 474 are privately raised by commune members. Including those that have been sold and eaten, the total number of pigs raised is 2,009. With more pigs, the fertilizer problem has been solved.

    The Lianqun Production Team mainly relies on collective breeding for raising pigs. In the early days of running the pig farm, they encountered many difficulties due to lack of experience. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, the breeders were full of energy. If they didn't understand, they learned. They learned while doing, and accumulated a lot of experience after a period of practice. Now, the pig farm of this team is very well run. All the pigs, large and small, are fat and strong, and pig diseases have been completely eliminated. The Party branch has vigorously strengthened the ideological education of the breeders, and has also seized Xu Heying and other "ten-woman all-around pig raisers" as pacesetters, and launched the "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced" campaign. They have established a "four-contract (contract for work, contract for output, contract for feed, contract for cost) and four-guarantee (guarantee for output, guarantee for survival, guarantee for breeding, guarantee for fertilizer)" responsibility system, which fully mobilized the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the breeders. The breeders proposed the slogan: love the farm like home, love the animals like children, love the grass like grain, work in front of the pen, live in front of the pen, sleep in front of the pen, be red in the animal husbandry farm, and specialize in the animal husbandry farm, and fight day and night in front of the pen.

    The breeders of this team have also created many new management methods. For example, at the beginning, 30% of the pigs grew poorly, so the breeders proposed to set up a "nutrition center" and send these pigs to the "nutrition center" for careful feeding; a "piglet cafeteria" was set up. There is a clear water pool around the "cafeteria". The piglets go through the pool to eat, and their feet are washed clean, which can prevent white dysentery; a "sanatorium" was set up to isolate and treat sick pigs. In addition, various preventive injections are often given to pigs, and the pigsty stipulates a system of cleaning every five days and washing (pig troughs) every three days to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in the farm, basically achieving no bad smell and no flies.

    In terms of feed, there are more than 160 mu of feed base, and 30 to 40 mu of river and pond water surface are planted with water hyacinth, etc., to achieve "greening the water surface, no land is not green", plus green storage feed in each season, and the use of wild feed to ensure that more than 1,400 pigs have sufficient feed.

    In order to accumulate more fertilizer, all 350 soft fences in the farm have been changed to hard fences, achieving fence-by-fence transformation and ditch-by-ditch communication. After the pigsty is transformed, it can reduce the loss of pig urine and increase the amount of fertilizer accumulated, and each pig can accumulate 15 to 20 dan more fertilizer per year.

    The commune members have calculated three accounts of the benefits of raising pigs: (1) Increase income. Because the team raises many pigs, not only does the income of the commune members increase year by year, but also the public accumulation of the team has greatly increased. In the three years from 1956 to 1958, they accumulated 15,666 yuan, and this year it is estimated that they can accumulate more than 17,600 yuan. (2) Increase grain production. The team now has 1,429 pigs. If each pig increases grain production by 200 jin, it can increase grain production by more than 285,000 jin. (3) Save labor. The team has accumulated 56,000 dan of pen manure since October last year. The fertilizer effect is equivalent to 560,000 dan of ash fertilizer. Calculated at 5 dan of ash per work day, it takes 311 people to ash for one year, while the labor force serving animal husbandry in this livestock farm is only 112 people (converted to 68 full labor force), which saves more than 240 full labor force.

    After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the cadres and commune members of the Lianqun Team were all delighted. They warmly responded to the great call of the Party, held high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and forged ahead courageously. Now, under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members are working day and night with full confidence to realize "1,000 jin of late rice and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes." All 420 mu of late rice fields planned to be planted with wheat in the team have been interplanted with green manure, and more than 1 million jin of fertilizer have been accumulated, preparing more than 20 dan of fertilizer per mu for the team's 500 mu of winter crops.

　　猪多肥足　五谷丰登
    头陀公社联群生产队每亩耕地有猪一头多
    据浙江日报报道　浙江黄岩县头陀人民公社联群生产队坚决贯彻执行以粮为纲、粮畜并举的生产方针，养猪事业有了飞跃的发展，现在这个生产队养猪一千四百二十九头（还养了耕牛一百三十八头，家禽一千七百六十八只）。全队一千二百四十七亩田地，平均每亩地有猪一点一四头；全队二百三十七户，平均每户有猪六点零二头。
    由于养猪多，增积了大批肥料，促进了农业增产。自去年10月到今年7月，这个队共积了栏肥五万六千担，平均每亩田施四十五担，比去年同期施肥量增加两倍以上。今年全队春花粮食的亩产量，比去年增长63.8％；早稻比去年增长40.4％，还出现了十六亩千斤早稻田。由于多积栏肥，减少了商品肥料开支，农业成本也从去年占总收入的32％降低到22％。
    随着粮畜生产的发展，社员的收入也大大增加，生活普遍得到改善。夏收预分结果，户户社员增加收入，全队公共积累有八千多元。平均每户社员存款六十二元八角四分。今年上半年售给国家二百头猪，超额完成了任务。
    这个队所在地的梓浦垟在解放前是一片死畈垟，没有一条河道，土质贫瘠，易涝易旱，十年九歉，粮食亩产只有二百来斤，有时甚至颗粒无收，人民生活极其贫苦，每年有30％左右的人外出帮工、讨饭。解放后，梓浦垟群众在党的领导下，年年兴修水利，到1955年春，全队共挖了一条大河、七条小沟，建筑了二个大闸，农田水利问题已基本解决了。大面积改种双季稻后，肥料需要量要比以前增加一倍左右。为了解决肥料问题，党支部又领导群众开展以养猪为中心的积肥运动。去年3月，副队长袁根富等四出采购小猪，在短短的三、四个月时间，全队公养猪从一百多头发展到二百零六头（其中母猪二十八头）。公社化后，由于公社的大力支持，母猪又由二十八头迅速发展到三百四十二头。肉猪迅速增加，目前饲养的就有一千四百二十九头，其中社员私养的四百七十四头，加上已出卖和自吃的，饲养量达二千零九头。猪多，肥料问题得到了解决。
    联群生产队养猪以集体饲养为主。在初办养猪场时，因为缺少经验，曾经遇到过不少困难。但是在党支部的领导下，饲养员们干劲冲天，不懂就学，边学边干，经过一段时间的实践，积累了不少经验。现在，这个队的养猪场办得非常出色。大小猪只头头膘肥，彻底消灭了猪病。党支部大力加强了对饲养员的思想教育，还抓住了徐荷英等“十女全能养猪手”为标兵，开展“学先进、赶先进、超先进”运动；建立了“四包（包工、包产、包饲料、包成本）四保（保产、保活、保养、保肥）”责任制，充分地调动了饲养员的积极性和责任心。饲养员们提出：爱场如家、爱畜如子、爱草如粮，工作在栏前、生活在栏前、睡在栏前，红在畜牧场、专在畜牧场的口号，日夜战斗在栏前。
    这个队的饲养员还创造了许多新的管理办法。如开始时有30％的猪长得差，饲养员们就提出设立“营养院”，把这些猪送入“营养院”精心饲养；设立了“小猪食堂”，“食堂”四周有一条清水池，小猪通过水池去吃食，四脚就洗净了，可以防止生白痢病；设立了“疗养院”，把病猪隔离，进行治疗饲养。此外，还经常给猪打各种防疫针，猪栏规定五天一打扫、三天一清洗（洗猪槽）的制度，保持了场内清洁卫生，基本上达到无恶臭，无苍蝇。
    饲料方面，有饲料基地一百六十多亩，三、四十亩河塘水面种上了水浮莲等，做到“水面绿化，无地不青”，再加上每个季节青储饲料，利用野生饲料，保证了一千四百多头猪有充足的饲料。
    为了增积更多的肥料，已将全场三百五十多个软栏全部改为硬栏，达到栏栏改造，沟沟相通。猪栏改造后，能减少猪尿流失，增加积肥数量，每头猪每年能多积肥十五至二十担。
    社员们对养猪的好处，算了三笔账：（一）增加收入。这个队由于养猪多，不仅社员收入年年增加，同时队里的公共积累也大大增加了。在1956年到1958年这三年中就积累了一万五千六百六十六元，今年一年预计就可积累一万七千六百多元。（二）增产粮食。全队现有一千四百二十九头猪，每头按积肥增产粮食二百斤计算，就能增产粮食二十八万五千多斤。（三）节约劳力。全队从去年10月以来，所积的栏肥五万六千担，肥效相等于五十六万担灰肥，按每工化灰五担计算，需要三百十一个人化一年，而这个畜牧场内服务于畜牧业的劳力，只有一百一十二人（折整劳动力六十八人），这就节省了二百四十多个整劳动力。
    党的八届八中全会决议公布后，联群队干部社员个个欢欣鼓舞，他们热烈响应党的伟大号召，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗奋勇前进。现在，社员们在党支部的领导下，正在满怀信心地为实现“千斤晚稻、万斤薯”而日夜奋战。全队四百二十亩计划种麦的晚稻田已全部套种绿肥，已积肥一百余万斤，给全队五百亩冬作每亩备足二十多担肥料。（附图片）
