Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: The Tower of Sino-Korean Friendship, built by the Korean people in Pyongyang to forever commemorate the achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers and further strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Korea, was unveiled today in a solemn ceremony by Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea.

Attending the unveiling ceremony were Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-yong, Nam Il, and Lee Joo-yeon; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, and Kim Chang-man; General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defence; leaders of various democratic political parties and social organizations; senior generals of the Korean People's Army; as well as Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, Qiao Xiaoguang, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea. All members of the Chinese-Korean Friendship Association delegation also attended the ceremony.

In his speech at the ceremony, Chairman Choi Yong-kun said that the construction of this Tower of Friendship by the Korean people, symbolizing the internationalist and militant friendship between the people of Korea and China, expresses the Korean people's infinite gratitude and friendship to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that when the Korean people were in the most arduous struggle against the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism, the fraternal Chinese people, with a spirit of internationalist unity, sent the Volunteers, composed of outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean front to assist us. The result of the Korean people fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers was a decisive blow to the enemy, which finally forced U.S. imperialism to submit, defended the freedom and independence of Korea, and made a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

Choi Yong-kun said that the Chinese People's Volunteers displayed unparalleled courage and collective heroism in the Korean War and contributed everything to the victory of the Korean people. They are internationalist fighters educated by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and they cherished every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers also sincerely helped the Korean people to carry out reconstruction in the post-war period. He said that the glorious achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War are the pride of progressive mankind and will be forever recorded in history.

Choi Yong-kun said that the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw from North Korea last year, making a great contribution to promoting the peaceful reunification of North Korea and easing international tensions. However, U.S. imperialism continues to occupy South Korea and Taiwan, exacerbating tensions in these regions. He emphasized that U.S. imperialism should learn from the historical lessons of its disastrous defeat in the Korean War and immediately get out of South Korea and the Taiwan region.

Choi Yong-kun said that the militant friendship between the people of North Korea and China has been further strengthened and developed in the socialist construction carried out by the people of the two countries. The Korean people must redouble their efforts to strengthen their friendship and solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people and continue to wage a resolute struggle for the common cause.

Wei Chuantong, head of the Chinese-Korean Friendship Association delegation, then spoke. He said that the unveiling of the "Friendship Tower" marks a further development of the militant friendship between the people of China and Korea. Wei Chuantong said that the reason why the Chinese People's Volunteers were able to achieve the great victory and achievements in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was because they possessed a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, because they received the infinite care and support from the Korean Workers' Party and government and all the Korean people, and because the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were closely united, cooperated in combat, supported each other, and jointly defeated the invaders and won the victory of the war. This internationalist militant friendship will shine forever in history.

The "Friendship Tower" stands on a hilltop on the western slope of Moranbong in Pyongyang, next to Mao Zedong Street. The tower is twenty meters high, and the tower body is entirely built of white granite. The three gilded characters "Friendship Tower" on the tower body and the large gold star on the top of the tower shine brilliantly. Inside the square base of the "Friendship Tower" is a stone chamber built of marble. In a stone casket in the center of the stone chamber are stored the names of the martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The three huge murals in the stone chamber and the two bas-reliefs on the outside of the tower base depict the glorious deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army during the war and helping the Korean people to carry out reconstruction in the post-war period.

Today, the leaders of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and the Cabinet, as well as the heads of various organs and organizations, presented wreaths to the "Friendship Tower." The people of Pyongyang and officers and soldiers of the People's Army continuously went to the "Friendship Tower" to offer flowers and admire the tower.

    纪念志愿军不朽功勋　进一步加强朝中友谊
    朝中友谊塔在平壤隆重揭幕
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜人民为了永远纪念中国人民志愿军的功勋和进一步加强朝中两国人民的友谊而在平壤市兴建的朝中友谊塔，今天在一个隆重仪式上由朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健揭幕。
    参加揭幕仪式的有朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一，内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，民族保卫相金光侠大将，各民主政党社会团体的负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领，以及中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和各国驻朝使节等。中朝友好协会代表团全体团员也参加了仪式。
    崔庸健委员长在仪式上发表讲话时说，朝鲜人民兴建这座象征着朝中两国人民间国际主义的战斗友谊的友谊塔，是表示朝鲜人民对中国人民和中国人民志愿军的无限感谢和友谊。他说，朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义的武装侵略的斗争处在最艰苦的时候，兄弟般的中国人民以国际主义的团结精神，派遣了以优秀的儿女组成的志愿军，前来朝鲜前线援助我们。朝鲜人民同中国人民志愿军并肩作战的结果，给敌人以决定性的打击，终于迫使美帝国主义屈服，保卫了朝鲜的自由和独立，并且对亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大贡献。
    崔庸健说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中发挥了无比的勇敢精神和集体英雄主义，为了朝鲜人民的胜利贡献了自己的一切。他们是中国共产党和毛泽东同志教育出来的国际主义战士，他们爱护朝鲜的一山、一水、一草、一木。中国人民和中国人民志愿军在战后时期又诚心诚意地帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设。他说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中立下的光辉的功勋，是进步人类的骄傲，它将永远记载在历史上。
    崔庸健说，中国人民志愿军在去年主动地从朝鲜撤出，对促进朝鲜的和平统一和缓和国际紧张局势作出了巨大贡献。但是美帝国主义仍然继续强占着南朝鲜和台湾，加剧着这些地区的紧张局势。他强调说，美帝国主义应当记取在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的历史教训，立即从南朝鲜和台湾地区滚出去。
    崔庸健说，朝中两国人民的战斗友谊在两国人民进行的社会主义建设中进一步得到加强发展。朝鲜人民要百倍地加强同兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，为了共同事业继续进行坚决的斗争。
    中朝友好协会代表团团长魏传统接着讲了话。他说，“友谊塔”的揭幕，标志着中朝两国人民的战斗友谊的进一步发展。魏传统说，中国人民志愿军所以能够取得抗美援朝的伟大胜利和成就，是因为他们具有高度的爱国主义和国际主义的品质，是因为得到了朝鲜劳动党和政府以及全体朝鲜人民的无限关怀和支援，是因为英雄的朝鲜人民军同中国人民志愿军亲密无间、协同作战、互相支援，共同打败了侵略者，赢得了战争的胜利。这种国际主义的战斗友谊将在历史上永放光彩。
    “友谊塔”屹立在平壤市牡丹峰西麓、毛泽东大街旁的一座山岗上。塔高二十米，塔身全部用白色花岗石建成。塔身上“友谊塔”三个镏金大字和塔顶上斗大的金星闪耀着灿烂的光芒。在“友谊塔”方形的塔座内，是一个用大理石筑成的石室，在石室中央的一个石函中，存放着中国人民志愿军烈士们的名单，石室内的三幅巨大的壁画和塔座外面两侧的两幅浮雕，描绘了中国人民志愿军在战争中同朝鲜人民军并肩作战和在战后帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设的光荣事迹。
    今天，朝鲜劳动党中央、最高人民会议常任委员会和内阁的领导人以及各机关团体的负责人都向“友谊塔”献了花圈。平壤市人民和人民军官兵络绎不绝地去向“友谊塔”献花，并瞻仰这座塔。
