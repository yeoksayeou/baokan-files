    Multiple Economies Blossom
    The Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Over the past year, the multiple economy production of the Lianhua Chi Commune has greatly developed. Both the scale and the achievements of production are unprecedented. Although this area has an average of 4.4 mu of land per person, most of it is alkaline land, leading to impoverished living conditions. Before liberation, only agricultural production was undertaken here. After liberation, when mutual aid teams and primary cooperatives were established, only 11 types of sideline production, such as transportation, oil pressing, tofu making, and weaving, were initiated, with a total income of only 1.14 million yuan. During the period of advanced cooperatives, from the winter of 1957 until the communization, sideline businesses expanded to 24 types. However, in the year following communization, the number of diversified business projects increased to 41, and the total output value increased by 162% compared to the previous year. It provided the state with over 980,000 yuan of commodities and greatly increased the commune's income, powerfully supporting agricultural production.
    In the past year since its establishment, the Lianhua Chi People's Commune in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, has achieved comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. From the beginning of September last year to the end of August this year, in less than a year, the total output value of the commune's diversified economy production reached 2.2 million yuan, with a net income of 1.444 million yuan, averaging 203 yuan per agricultural household.
    The development of multiple economies has provided many commodities to support national construction and supply the people's growing needs. The commune provided the state with livestock products, saltpeter, various woven goods, vegetables, fruits, and other products, totaling 35 types, with a total value of over 980,000 yuan, an increase of 75% compared to the same period last year. The development of multiple economies has also increased the commune's income, strongly supporting the development of agricultural production. Last year, over 50,000 mu of the commune's 70,000 mu of autumn crops suffered from floods, resulting in little to no yield and a shortage of 610,000 yuan in production and living expenses. Under these circumstances, in addition to using a state loan of 59,000 yuan, the commune mainly relied on the income from developing sideline occupations such as fisheries to solve the difficulties in production and livelihood. A total of 53,200 yuan was invested in agricultural production, purchasing over 8,000 pieces of farm tools, 32 head of draft animals, 340,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, 32,000 jin of seeds, and 4.5 million jin of fodder, powerfully supporting the development of agricultural production. This year, wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, more than double that of 1958. Autumn crops are generally growing well, and the total annual output is expected to increase by 45% compared to 1958. The development of multiple economies has changed the historically poor conditions of the Lianhua Chi Commune. Twenty-seven of the commune's 46 production teams have caught up with the production and living standards of general or wealthy teams. The Congjia Production Team, with 170 households, suffered from a large amount of alkaline and silted land, and the grain produced was insufficient for consumption, relying on state relief loans every year. Over the years, it had accumulated 100,000 yuan in state loans. Therefore, the surrounding villagers called this village – Congjia – "Poor Home." After communization, sideline production such as boiling saltpeter, weaving, boiling small salt, and transportation was initiated. By August, a total of 16,120 yuan in cash had been earned, averaging 95 yuan per household, and 4,000 yuan of state loans had been repaid. This year, 1,800 mu of wheat yielded 150,000 jin, and after self-consumption, 80,000 jin of surplus grain was sold to the state. From then on, the people here changed their past views and called this team "Rich Home," and no one called it "Poor Home" anymore. The development of diversified business production has also increased the income of commune members and improved their living standards. The commune used the income from multiple economies to purchase 460,000 jin of food grain and 4.5 million jin of firewood for commune members, and distributed 210,000 yuan in wages to commune members. Last winter, 911 pieces of cotton clothing and 495 quilts were also provided to commune members with living difficulties. Thanks to the development of multiple economies, the commune not only successfully overcame the famine but also improved the living standards of commune members compared to before. Before communization, over 4,200 of the commune's 7,000 households owed state loans. Now, only 2,245 households owe loans, and the number of households with savings deposits has increased to 5,130, an increase of 52% compared to the same period last year.
    Why has the development of diversified business production in the Lianhua Chi Commune been so rapid and achieved such great results in just one year? The development and consolidation of the People's Commune is the most fundamental reason.
    The commune can more rationally utilize natural resources and promote the development of multiple economies.
    Although the Lianhua Chi People's Commune was a poor area prone to natural disasters in the past, it has abundant resources for diversified business. The commune has over 500 rivers of various sizes, with ponds scattered throughout the villages. The northern part relies on the Da Langdian, which can produce a large amount of aquatic products; it has 69,000 mu of alkaline land for boiling saltpeter and small salt; it can also produce 20 million jin of red vitex annually for weaving and firewood. It has over 20,000 mu of natural pasture for developing animal husbandry, and so on. However, before communization, these abundant resources were never fully utilized.
    Soon after the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, cadres were organized to conduct on-the-spot surveys, visits, and meetings with experienced farmers to comprehensively survey the commune's resources. Then, the commune concentrated manpower and resources to carry out comprehensive development, making use of resources that had not been utilized in the past and rationally utilizing those that were not used reasonably. The ideal of "making the best use of everything and making the most of the land," which people have been pursuing for many years, has been initially realized. During the agricultural cooperative period, there was a natural pasture of over 20,000 mu that could accommodate more than 3,000 cattle and sheep between the five cooperatives of Wujiafang, Congjia, Xiaowangzhuang, Lengxinzhuang, and Xiaoli, but only 300 sheep were grazing here. After the establishment of the commune, a livestock farm was established here, raising more than 1,500 sheep, 230 pigs, and 120 small draft animals. The Da Langdian accumulates 20,000 to 30,000 mu of water every year, owned by nine agricultural cooperatives near the bank of the marsh. The marsh is rich in fish and shrimp, but because the agricultural cooperatives had few people and few nets, they could not catch a large amount, and they did not allow agricultural cooperatives from other places to fish. Even the nine cooperatives near the marsh often caused fights and brawls during fishing due to prohibitions on fishing in the water belonging to their own cooperative, restricting the development of aquatic products in the Da Langdian. After the establishment of the commune, this restriction was broken, and the commune organized unified management. During the peak fish production season, almost all production teams in the commune went to the marsh to fish. In the past year, the Da Langdian produced 300,000 jin of fish, more than six times the amount in previous years. All 160 pits and ponds in the commune suitable for fish farming were utilized within four months after communization, with a total of 40 million fish fry, 24 mu of lotus roots, and 180 mu of reeds. Sideline businesses such as boiling saltpeter, boiling small salt, and weaving have been widely carried out on alkaline and saltpeter land.
    Reasonable arrangement and use of labor, with production every day and income every month
    In the past, agricultural cooperatives had few laborers, and multiple business operations could not be taken care of at the same time and fully developed. Often, some sideline businesses were only carried out during the spring and winter slack seasons; some agricultural cooperatives did not even carry out sideline businesses during the slack season, only doing so after suffering disasters.
    The People's Commune, with its large scale, wide range of activities, and large number of laborers, can solve this problem. First of all, the commune uniformly arranged the labor distribution ratio between agricultural production and other diversified businesses according to the needs of production development: In winter, when there is less agricultural work, the labor force engaged in sideline business production accounts for about 40% of the total labor force; in late spring and early autumn, when agricultural work is not very intensive, the labor force engaged in sideline business accounts for about 20% of the total; in summer, when agricultural work is intensive, the labor force engaged in sideline business accounts for about 15% of the total. A combination of establishing fixed professional teams and mobilizing thousands of households. For those with strong technical requirements, requiring a large amount of funds, and suitable for long-term fixed and concentrated management, such as non-staple food agricultural product processing, fisheries, sewing, woodworking, vegetable gardens, etc., 37 sideline factories and perennial professional teams were organized (one run by the commune and 32 run by production teams); for those with strong seasonality, suitable for collective management, but not permanently fixed, such as boiling saltpeter, boiling small salt, and weaving, temporary professional teams were organized; for those that are scattered, require little capital, and are not technically demanding, they are carried out by commune members, and the income belongs to the commune members themselves. Secondly, great collaboration is implemented on the basis of equivalent exchange, including collaboration between different industries, between regions, and between units. This spring, the Tama Temple Production Team had a lot of red vitex, but few weavers, and could not complete the contract task of weaving carrying baskets on time. The commune uniformly organized 42 weavers from four production teams, including Da Qibu, Xuheyang, and others, to assist the Tama Temple Production Team in weaving for ten days according to the principle of equivalent exchange, completing the weaving contract task on time.
    The reasonable arrangement of labor enables agricultural production and multiple economic productions to be fully developed, and the perennial production and seasonal production to be closely combined. Thus, it is possible to: do a little when busy with farming, do a lot when not busy, make seasonal assaults, and continue throughout the year, with production every day and income every month. The Duan Liubu Management District has a total of 2,920 laborers. During the tense season when summer harvesting, summer planting, and field management are crowded together, it still maintains 528 laborers (accounting for 17% of the total labor force) to engage in diversified business production such as fishing, vegetable growing, weaving, transportation, and herding pigs and sheep. This year, although the summer harvest, summer planting, and field management in this management district are more demanding and have larger tasks than in previous years, they are completed better and earlier than in previous years (the summer harvest and summer planting were advanced by half a month).
    Facts also prove that the rational arrangement of labor enables many skilled laborers to engage in various productions, thus achieving the goal of "those who can write write, those who can fight fight," making the best use of talent. According to surveys, about 40% of the labor force participating in diversified business production are semi-labor and auxiliary labor. Although their labor capacity is not strong, they have skills, and the value they generate is very high. The Dafangzi Production Team has 838 people, and 56 people participate in diversified business production, accounting for 7% of the total population. Among them, 25 are full laborers, accounting for 9% of the total full laborers, and 31 are semi-labor and auxiliary laborers, accounting for 55% of the total labor force participating in diversified business production. From January to August this year, they operated seven types of sideline businesses, earning more than 16,800 yuan, averaging 77 yuan per household.
    The People's Commune has more favorable conditions than agricultural cooperatives in solving the problems of funds, grain, and tools needed for the development of diversified business.
    During the period of agricultural cooperatives, there were more difficulties in engaging in diversified business. According to statistics: In the early cooperative period in 1955, 27 cooperatives engaged in sideline businesses, with insufficient funds, and borrowed 45,000 yuan. In the advanced cooperative period in 1958, 14 cooperatives engaged in sideline businesses, borrowing 32,000 yuan. In the year after communization, only 12,000 yuan was borrowed for diversified business production, and most of the investment was solved by the commune. The commune mainly solved the funds for diversified business by: concentrating the scattered surplus funds through the credit cooperative to support 28 production teams lacking funds for diversified business production; providing necessary care to production teams with difficulties, such as organizing them to engage in more diversified businesses with small investments and quick returns; in addition, the state also adopted the method of advance deposits to support diversified business production. The Fanjia Production Team of the Lianhua Chi People's Commune suffered serious disasters last year, with insufficient grain for consumption and no money to invest in sideline businesses. According to the principle of equivalent exchange, the commune transferred more than 11,000 jin of grain from the Duan Liubu Production Team to solve the problem of eating; and borrowed 560 yuan from the credit cooperative to start 31 types of production such as boiling saltpeter, weaving, and fishing. By the end of June, a net income of 9,160 yuan was obtained, not only repaying foreign debts but also buying 12 double-furrow plows and small farm tools. In addition, all 110 households in the team earned an average of 48 yuan per household.
    The combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military into one, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, is twisted into one force, further promoting the development of diversified economic production.
    In order to do a good job in supply and procurement, the Lianhua Chi Commune fully utilized the enthusiasm of the commercial sector. By adjusting the commercial network, 21 new procurement points, 18 mobile procurement teams, and 27 consignment points were established in the commune. The commercial sector also transferred five cadres to go deep into the production teams to assist in finding resources, making plans, signing procurement contracts, understanding supply needs, providing technical guidance, and sending two purchasing agents to conduct purchase and sales contacts with the production teams on a regular basis. Basically, it has been achieved that whatever is produced is purchased, whatever is lacking is supplied, and whatever is lacking is produced and supplied. In the past year, the commune's commercial sector signed a total of 164 supply and marketing contracts with the commune and production teams, with a total value of more than 34,000 yuan, an increase of 41% compared to the same period last year. More than 18,000 pieces of raw materials and small tools for diversified businesses were supplied, and 35 types of agricultural and sideline products were purchased, with a total value of more than 42,700 yuan, an increase of 47% compared to the same period last year. This not only further supported the development of diversified business production but also further incorporated diversified business into the national production plan.
    The commune-run industry produced more than 12,000 pieces of small tools such as weeding hoes, harrows, sickles, and shoe sole clamping plates needed for agricultural and diversified business production, and at the same time, it repaired the tools that needed to be repaired for agricultural and diversified business production in a timely manner, supporting the development of diversified business production.
    The commune further strengthened its leadership.
    The original agricultural cooperatives focused on developing agriculture and did not pay close attention to diversified economic production, and there was no one in charge of management. Therefore, diversified economic production was often squeezed out by agriculture. After communization, in order to strengthen the leadership of diversified economy, the commune Party committee, from the commune Party committee to the management district and the production team, divided a battle line from top to bottom, determined full-time leaders, and established specialized organizations. The commune established a diversified economic production committee, managed by a deputy secretary. The management district was managed by a director or deputy director, and the production team was managed by a deputy captain. The commune Party committee, management district, and production team Party branch can regularly inspect and study diversified economy, and strengthen political and ideological work and organize and mobilize the masses by setting up red flags, establishing pacesetters, and organizing appraisal competitions. This ensures the development of diversified economic production from the organizational leadership. In the diversified economy red flag competition and appraisal in May, the Duan Liubu Production Team was rated as a red flag unit, and a "learn from Duan Liubu, catch up with Duan Liubu" upsurge was quickly set off throughout the commune. The Fanjia Production Team transferred 35 laborers and expanded 17 diversified economic projects. In one month, the team earned more than 750 yuan, an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous month. The He Qibu basket weaving professional team increased from weaving one and a half baskets per person per day to two, and some even reached more than three.
    The Lianhua Chi People's Commune has shown strong vitality and unparalleled superiority in the fact that diversified economy has greatly developed in the past year. However, this superiority has not yet been fully utilized. Any doubts and accusations about the superiority of the People's Commune are manifestations of right-leaning thinking that cannot stand. Therefore, we must continue to implement the general line, oppose right-leaning conservatism, and better and more fully exert the superiority of the People's Commune to promote greater development of diversified economic production.

    多种经济百花开
    中共交河县委会
    一年来，莲花池公社多种经济生产有很大的发展，无论生产的规模或是生产的成绩都是空前的。这个地区虽然平均每人有地四点四亩，但大部是碱地，生活贫困。在解放前这里只搞农业生产。解放后，办互助组和初级社时只搞起了运输、榨油、作豆腐、编织等十一种副业生产，总收入才一百一十四万元；高级社时，从1957年冬至公社化前，副业扩大到二十四种。而公社化后的一年中，多种经营项目增加到四十一种，总产值比前一年增长了162％，为国家提供了总产值达九十八万多元的商品，还大大增加了公社的收入，有力地支援了农业生产。
    河北交河县莲花池人民公社，建社一年来，农、林、牧、副、渔获得了全面发展。从去年9月初至今年8月底，不到一年时间，全社多种经济生产的总产值达二百二十万元，纯收入一百四十四万四千元，全社农业户每户平均二百零三元。
    多种经济的发展，为支持国家建设和供应人民日益增长的需要，提供了很多的商品。公社为国家提供了畜牧业产品、皮硝、各种编织、蔬菜、瓜果等，共三十五种产品，总值达九十八万多元，比去年同期增长75％。多种经济的发展，还增加了公社的收入，有力地支持了农业生产的发展。去年，这个公社七万亩秋季作物，有五万多亩遭受水灾，收益无几，缺少生产、生活费六十一万元。在这样的情况下，除用了国家贷款五万九千元以外，主要是依靠发展副业渔业等生产的收入，解决了生产、生活上的困难。计用于农业生产的投资达五万三千二百元，购买了农具八千多件、耕畜三十二头、化肥三十四万斤、种籽三万二千斤、饲草四百五十万斤，有力地支持了农业生产的发展。今年小麦获得了比1958年增长一倍以上的空前大丰收。秋季作物生长一般良好，预计全年总产量比1958年可增长45％。多种经济的发展，改变了莲花池公社历年来的穷困面貌。全社四十六个生产队，有二十七个穷队赶上了一般队或富队的生产和生活水平。丛家生产队一百七十户，因碱淤地多，生产的粮食不够食用，年年依靠国家救济贷款。几年来，共欠下国家贷款十万元，因此，周围村的群众把这村——丛家叫作“穷家”。公社化后，搞起了熬硝、编织、熬小盐、运输等副业生产，到8月份共收入了现款一万六千一百二十元，平均每户九十五元，还了国家贷款四千元。今年一千八百亩麦子，打了十五万斤，除了自食外，卖给国家余粮八万斤。从此，这里的人们转变了过去的看法，都叫这队“富家”，没有人再叫“穷家”了。多种经营生产的发展，还增加了社员收入，提高了社员的生活水平。公社用多种经济的收入，给社员购买生活用粮四十六万斤，烧柴四百五十万斤，发放社员工资二十一万元。去年冬季还解决了生活有困难的社员的棉衣九百一十一件，棉被四百九十五件。由于多种经济的发展，不仅胜利地度过了灾荒，而且社员的生活比以前富裕了。公社化前，全社七千多户，有四千二百户欠国家贷款，如今欠贷款的仅二千二百四十五户，存款户增加到五千一百三十户，比去年同期增加52％。
    为什么仅仅一年时间，莲花池公社的多种经营生产的发展速度这么快，获得的成绩这么大呢？人民公社的发展和巩固是一个最根本的原因。
    公社能够更合理地利用自然资源，促进多种经济的发展
    莲花池人民公社，过去虽然是个地势低洼，经常受自然灾害危害的贫穷地区，但是，多种经营资源却很丰富。全社有大小河流五百多条，坑塘密布各村，北部靠大浪淀，能生产大量的水产；有六万九千亩碱地可供熬硝、熬小盐；还能年产二千万斤红荆条，可作编织、烧柴用。有二万多亩天然牧场，可以大量发展畜牧业，等等。但是，在公社化前，从来没有充分地利用起这些丰富的资源。
    公社成立不久，就在公社党委的统一领导下，组织干部实地勘察、访问和开老农座谈会，普查了全社的资源。然后，公社就集中人力、物力进行了全面开发，使过去没有利用起来的资源，利用起来了；利用不合理的，合理利用了。多少年来，人们追求的“物尽其用，地尽其利”的理想，初步实现了。农业社时，在吴家坊、丛家、小王庄、冷辛庄、小李五个社间，有一个能容纳三千多头牛羊的二万多亩地的天然畜牧场，但是，这五个小社只有三百多只羊在这里放牧。公社成立以后，在这里建立了畜牧场，放养了一千五百多只羊、二百三十头猪、一百二十头小耕畜。大浪淀每年积水二、三万亩，分属靠近淀边的九个农业社所有。淀内盛产鱼、虾，因农业社人少、网少，不能大量捕捞，又不让外地农业社捕捞，就是靠近淀边的九个社，在捕鱼中常常因禁止到本社所属的水面中捕捞，引起打架斗殴，束缚着大浪淀水产的发展。公社成立后，打破了这种限制，由公社统一组织经营，产鱼旺季，几乎全社各个生产队都到淀里捕鱼。一年来大浪淀产鱼三十万斤，超过往年六倍以上。全社适合养鱼的坑塘一百六十个，公社化后，不到四个月的时间，全部利用起来，共放养鱼苗四千万尾，种藕二十四亩、苇子一百八十亩。在碱硝地，已普遍搞起了熬硝、熬小盐、编织等副业生产。
    合理安排和使用劳力，日日有生产，月月有收入
    过去农业社劳力少，多种经营不能同时兼顾，全面发展。往往只是春、冬农闲时搞些副业；有的农业社甚至农闲时也不搞，只是受灾后才搞。
    规模大、活动范围广、劳力多的人民公社，就可以解决这个问题。首先，公社根据生产发展的需要，统一安排了农业生产和其他多种经营的劳力分配比例：冬季农活较少，搞副业等生产的劳力占总劳力数的40％左右；春末、秋初农活不十分紧张，搞副业等的劳力占总数的20％左右；夏季农活紧张，搞副业等的劳力占总数的15％左右。建立固定专业队和发动千家万户相结合。对于技术性较强，需要资金较多，宜于长期固定集中经营的，如副食品农产品加工、渔业、缝纫、木业、菜园等，组织了三十七个副业工厂和常年专业队（其中社营一个，生产队营三十二个）；对于季节性较强，宜于集体经营，但不能常年固定的熬硝、熬小盐、编织等，则组织临时专业队；对于零星分散、需要资金少、技术性不强的，则由社员搞，收入归社员自己。其次，在等价交换的基础上实行大协作，这里包括不同行业之间的协作、地区之间和单位之间的协作。今春，塔马寺生产队红荆条多，编织人员少，不能按期完成编织抬筐合同任务，公社统一组织了大七卜、徐和杨等四个生产队四十二名编织人员，按照等价交换的原则，协助塔马寺生产队编了十天，按期完成了编织合同任务。
    合理安排劳力，使农业生产和多种经济生产得到全面发展，常年性生产和季节性生产得到密切结合。从而作到了：农忙小搞，不忙大搞，季节突击，常年不断，日日有生产，月月有收入。段六卜管理区共二千九百二十名劳力，在夏收、夏种、田间管理三项农活挤在一起的紧张季节，仍保持了五百二十八名劳力（占劳力总数17％）搞捕鱼、种菜、编织、运输、牧放猪羊等多种经营生产。今年，这个管理区夏收、夏种、田间管理虽然较往年要求高、任务大，但是，却比往年完成的好、完成的早（夏收、夏种提前了半个月）。
    事实还证明，合理安排劳力，使许多有技术的劳力，从事多种多样的生产，这就作到了能文搞文、能武搞武，人尽其才。据调查，现在参加多种经营生产的劳力，40％左右是半劳力及辅助劳力。他们劳动能力虽然不强，但是有技术，产生的价值却很大。大方子生产队八百三十八人，参加多种经营生产的五十六个，占总人口的7％，其中整劳力二十五人，占整劳力总数的9％，半劳力、辅助劳力三十一人，占参加多种经营生产劳动总数的55％，从今年1月至8月，共经营大小副业七种，收入一万六千八百多元，平均每户七十七元。
    在解决发展多种经营所需要的资金、粮食、工具等问题中，人民公社比农业社具有更多的有利条件
    在农业社时期，搞多种经营，困难较多。据统计：1955年初级社时，有二十七个社搞副业，资金不足，贷款四万五千元。1958年高级社时期，有十四个社搞副业，贷款三万二千元。公社化后的一年，搞多种经营生产只贷款一万二千元，绝大部分投资都是依靠公社解决的。公社解决多种经营的资金主要是：通过信用社，把分散的余款集中起来，支援了多种经营生产资金缺乏的二十八个生产队；对有困难生产队给予必要的照顾，如组织他们多搞一些投资小、收益快的多种经营；此外，国家还采取预付定金的办法，支持多种经营生产。莲花池人民公社范家生产队，去年受灾严重，粮食不够吃，搞副业又没钱投资。按照等价交换的原则，由公社抽调了段六卜生产队一万一千多斤粮食，解决了吃饭问题；并从信用社贷款五百六十元，搞起了熬硝、编织、捕鱼等三十一种生产。到6月底获得纯收入九千一百六十元，不但还了外债，还买了双铧犁和小农具十二件，另外，全队一百一十户，平均每户收入了四十八元。
    工、农、商、学、兵结合成一体，在公社党委的统一领导下，拧成一股劲，进一步促进了多种经济生产的发展
    为了作好供应、收购工作，莲花池公社充分发挥了商业部门的积极性。通过调整商业网，在全社新建立了二十一个收购点，十八个流动收购组，二十七个代销点。商业部门还抽调了五名干部，深入到各个生产队，协助找资源、作规划、签订收购合同、了解供应需要，进行技术指导，并派出两名采购员，经常到各生产队进行购、销联系。基本上作到了生产什么，就收购什么，缺什么，就供应什么，缺多少就生产供应多少。一年来，公社商业部门与公社、生产队共签订了供销合同一百六十四件，总值三万四千多元，比去年同期增长41％。供应多种经营原料、小型工具一万八千多件，收购农副产品达三十五种，总值四万二千七百多元，比去年同期增长47％。不仅进一步支持了多种经营生产的发展，而且使多种经营进一步纳入了国家生产计划。
    社办工业生产了农业、多种经营生产所需要的耘锄、耠子、镰刀、鞋底板夹等小型工具一万二千余件，同时，及时修配了农业、多种经营生产需要修理的工具，支持了多种经营生产的发展。
    公社进一步加强了领导
    原来的农业社，由于着重发展农业，对多种经济生产抓得不紧，没有专人管理，因而，多种经济生产往往被农业挤掉。公社化后，公社党委为了加强多种经济的领导，从公社党委到管理区、生产队，自上而下划分了一条战线，确定了专职领导，建立了专门组织。公社建立了多种经济生产委员会，由一名副书记专管。管理区由一名主任或副主任管理，生产队一名副队长管理。公社党委、管理区、生产队党支部都能经常对多种经济检查、研究，并通过树红旗、立标兵、组织评比竞赛，加强政治思想工作，组织和发动群众。这就从组织领导上保证了多种经济生产的发展。在5月份多种经济红旗竞赛评比中，段六卜生产队被评为红旗单位，迅速在全社范围内掀起了一个“学习段六卜，赶上段六卜”的热潮。范家生产队抽调了三十五名劳力，扩大了十七种多种经济项目，一个月时间，全队收入了七百五十多元，比前一个月增加20％多。何七卜编筐专业队，由过去每人日编一个半提高到两个，多的达到三个以上。
    莲花池人民公社，在一年来多种经济大发展的事实中，已显示了强大的生命力和无比的优越性。但是，这种优越性，还远远没有发挥出来。一切对人民公社优越性的怀疑、指责，都是站不住脚的右倾思想的表现。因此，我们必须继续贯彻总路线，反对右倾保守，更好地、更充分地发挥人民公社的优越性，促进多种经济生产更大发展。
