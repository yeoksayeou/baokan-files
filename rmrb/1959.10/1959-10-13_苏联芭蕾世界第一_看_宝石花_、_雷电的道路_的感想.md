Soviet Ballet is the World's Best
——Thoughts on "The Stone Flower" and "The Path of Thunder"
Ouyang Yuqian

　　It is a universally acknowledged fact that Soviet ballet is the best in the world. The Soviet ballet school has a history of nearly two hundred years, cultivating many outstanding actors, directors, and teachers, with a deep artistic accumulation and many enduring repertoire pieces. After the October Revolution, thanks to the care and cultivation of the Soviet Communist Party, it achieved greater development and new achievements, which is not the case in other countries.

　　Soviet ballet has always closely integrated dance art with poetry, music, and fine arts, and has done so in the best way. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the ideological content of the works has been strengthened, while the artistic quality has been continuously improved, giving it a new look. We deeply feel this from some of the programs that have recently come to China to perform.

　　"The Stone Flower" is a very interesting folk tale about a mountain containing various treasures, guarded by a snake fairy. A stone carver, with his high labor enthusiasm and sincerity towards art, discovers the secret of the treasure mountain. Similar legends exist in China, and we do not feel unfamiliar when we see them, but we did not expect that performing it in the form of a ballet would have such great charm. The stonemason Danila (played by F. V. Vasilyev) is so focused on carving a malachite vase that he is still conceiving it even during his engagement ceremony; he firmly refuses to let the workshop foreman take a cup he has carved, but is willing to break it because the things carved on it are not vivid enough; in order to explore the secret of the stone flower, he disregards the danger and follows the Copper Mountain Princess (played by M. M. Plisetskaya) deep into the Snake Mountain; this spirit - through performance - moves the Copper Mountain Princess and the audience.

　　The Copper Mountain Princess is sometimes a green lizard and sometimes a malachite maiden. Plisetskaya's dance is also so unpredictable. Her body looks like transparent malachite, but it is also so soft that it can be folded at will. I think it would be difficult for a sculptor to shape her dance posture as accurately as she grasps the center of gravity, especially since many complex factors constitute the beauty of art. The various gemstone dances display the characteristics of various gemstones, with beautiful compositions, novel formation changes, and wonderful solo dances, filling the stage with the mysterious atmosphere of the treasure mountain.

　　Danila's fiancée, Katerina (played by Ye. Se. Maksimova), expresses her deep and pure love very powerfully. I especially like the scene where she stands with her back to the audience, staring blankly at the petrified Danila. Her love makes Danila return from stone to human. Katerina is an exceptionally pure and typical Russian girl image, and it is most appropriate to choose Maksimova to play the role.

　　It is very difficult to create the image of a villain in a work of art. It is necessary to show his characteristics and ugly essence, but without giving the audience unbearable stimulation, and only making an appropriate comparison with the good people. Artistic performance is to convey inner activities through external forms, so the performance of the villain should also be reasonable and empathetic. If the villainous role is excessively caricatured inappropriately, it is easy to destroy the integrity of a work of art, so it is not easy to play a villainous role well. I think the image of Severian in "The Stone Flower" is very well created. He (F. Ya. Levashov) fully utilizes the techniques of Russian folk dance, extremely reasonably selecting each movement and exaggerating it appropriately, highlighting the character's personality, which can be said to be just right.

　　Many scenes in this play use Russian folk dance, showing a strong national flavor, which is a characteristic. Another feature is that the story is a myth and legend, but the performance is full of life and makes people feel亲切.

　　"The Path of Thunder" is a play that reflects modern life and raises international political issues - the oppression of colonialism and racial discrimination. This play exposes and condemns those ugly imperialist acts, and praises class friendship and racial friendship. To express such a theme in the form of ballet, as far as I know, this is the first. It can be said with certainty that this is also a success.

　　After watching this play, I first wanted to hear the opinions of the general audience. I asked people who usually don't watch ballet very much, and they were all moved by this play. They said that this play is very meaningful and very good-looking. It seems that both the dance and the music were accepted by them, especially since they thought it had life and emotion and was easy to understand. I think their words can also be used as evidence of the success of this play.

　　The achievements of this play in artistic creation methods are also very great. Whether in dance, music, or stage art, it vividly expresses African characteristics. The composer Karayev has a deep understanding of African music. In the music of this ballet, African black folk songs are used, and African percussion instruments are used in the orchestration of symphonic music, showing the unique rhythm of African music, strengthening the national color of this ballet, and closely combining the music with the plot. A musician said to me that the layout of the music in this ballet is particularly good, and the introduction and description of the characters have distinct musical images, which is extremely rare and valuable.

　　The choreography of "The Path of Thunder" also has a unique style. African ethnic forms of dance and pointe work are cleverly coordinated, creating various character images. Whether it is group dance, solo dance, or pas de deux, it is arranged very appropriately according to the theme of the ballet. The thoughts and feelings of each character appearing on stage can be clearly seen from the dance movements. The dance and music progress very harmoniously and beautifully, and display a serious atmosphere of struggle. Sally and Lenny's tragedy generally illustrates the contradictions between races and classes, but the pas de deux in the love scene between Sally (played by O. V. Lepeshinskaya) and Lenny (played by K. M. Sergeyev) is truly beautiful! What is particularly good is that the levels of emotional development are exceptionally clear: initially there are many concerns, step by step they put aside their concerns, express sincere love to each other, and then further confide in each other regardless of everything. They bravely expressed strong resistance to the colonialists and racists. Another thing that is touching is that the black man Marco deliberately fought with the landlord's thugs to protect the lovers, resulting in his own injury. This place does not take much effort to express, powerfully showing class and racial friendship, but it is a very powerful stroke. The audience involuntarily shouted "Bravo"!

　　"The Stone Flower" and "The Path of Thunder" are two plays with completely different styles, but they have a common beauty. The first is that the music and dance achieve seamless unity - the actors, the orchestra, and the orchestra conductor are completely consistent in thought, emotion, understanding, rhythm, and technique. Second, the dance can be seamlessly and closely integrated with the theme, the life of the characters, and their emotions. As soon as the play begins, the audience unconsciously enters the play, breathing in sync with the characters and becoming one with them. That's how I felt. After watching a couple of plays, I forgot that the performance on stage was a dance, because the reality of art and the emotions of the audience were blended together, and the stage and the audience forgot each other. This is the so-called highest realm of art! To achieve the above, one must undergo rigorous technical training, and also have sufficient artistic accomplishment. Especially important is to have Marxist-Leninist thought as the backbone. The organic combination of the high ideological content and high artistic quality of Soviet ballet is a model for us to learn from. The deep accumulation of traditional heritage, the grandeur of the scale, and the superb technology are also obvious to all. Soviet ballet cannot but be said to be the best in the world.

　　苏联芭蕾世界第一
　　——看“宝石花”、“雷电的道路”的感想
　　欧阳予倩
    苏联芭蕾世界第一，是公认的事实。苏联的芭蕾舞学校已经有了将近二百年的历史，培养出来很多优秀的演员、导演和教师，有深厚的艺术积累，有许多久演不衰的保留节目。十月革命以后，由于苏联共产党的关心和培养，得到更大的发展，和新的成就，这是别的国家所没有的。
    苏联芭蕾一直是把舞蹈艺术同诗，同音乐、美术紧密结合着而又结合得最好的。由于党的正确领导，加强了作品的思想性，同时也不断提高了艺术性，使它呈现着新的面貌，我们从最近来中国演出的一些节目里，就深深地感觉到这一点。
    “宝石花”是一个很有趣味的民间故事，一座蕴藏着各种宝物的山，由蛇仙护卫。一个刻石工人凭着他高度的劳动热情和对艺术的真诚，探到宝山的秘密。类似这样的传说中国也有，我们看了也不感觉生疏，可是没想到用舞剧的形式表演出来，会有那么大的魅力。石匠达尼拉（弗·维·瓦西里耶夫扮演）为着刻一个孔雀石的瓶子，专心致志到甚至在举行订婚仪式的时候，还在一意构思；他刻好的一个杯子坚决不让工场管事拿去，可是为着上边所刻的东西不够生动，情愿把它打破；为着探寻宝石花的秘密，不顾危险跟随铜山公主（玛·米·普利谢茨卡娅扮演）深入蛇山；这种精神——通过表演——感动了铜山公主，也感动了观众。
    铜山公主忽而是一条绿色的蜥蜴，忽而又是一个孔雀石姑娘，普列谢茨卡娅的舞蹈也同是这样神化莫测，她的身体看上去就像透明的孔雀石，可是又柔软得像可以随便折叠起来，我想一个雕刻家要塑造她的舞姿，恐怕也很难像她那样准确的掌握重心，尤其是许多复杂的因素构成艺术之美。各色的宝石舞，显示着各种宝石的特性，美丽的构图，新颖的队形变化，还有精采的独舞，满台弥漫着宝山的神秘气氛。
    达尼拉的未婚妻卡捷里娜（叶·谢·玛克辛莫娃扮演）深纯的爱，表现得非常有力。我很欢喜她背对着观众呆呆地望着已经化石的达尼拉的那个场面。她的爱使达尼拉从石头复变为人。卡捷里娜是一个异常纯洁的典型的俄罗斯少女形象，挑选玛克辛莫娃来演，再适当也没有了。
    艺术作品中塑造反派人物的形象是很不容易的，要表现他的特点和丑恶的本质，但是又不能给观众难于忍受的刺激，只要跟善良人方面作适当的对比就行了。艺术表演是要通过外形传达内心活动，所以表现反派也要入情入理。演反派角色如果不适当地作了过分的丑化，是很容易破坏一个艺术品的完整的，所以要演好一个反派角色并不是容易的。我觉得“宝石花”里谢维里扬这个角色的形象，创造得非常好。他（弗·亚·列瓦绍夫）充分运用了俄罗斯民间舞的技巧，极为合理地选择了每一个动作加以适当的夸张，突出角色的性格，可说是恰到好处。
    这个戏许多场面运用了俄罗斯民间舞，表现出浓厚的民族色彩，这是个特点。还有就是故事是一个神话传说，而在表演中充满着生活气息，令人感到亲切。
    “雷电的道路”是反映现代生活的戏，提出了国际政治问题——殖民主义的压迫和种族的歧视。这个戏暴露并谴责了那些丑恶的帝国主义行为，颂扬了阶级友爱和种族友爱，用芭蕾的形式表现这样的题材，就我所知，这还是第一个。肯定的说，这也是成功的一个。
    我看完这个戏，首先想听听一般观众的意见，我问过平常不大看芭蕾的人，他们都为这个戏所感动，他们说这个戏很有意义又很好看。看上去舞蹈和音乐都为他们所接受了，尤其是他们认为有生活有感情一看就能懂。我认为他们的话，也就可以作为这个戏成功的证据。
    这个戏在艺术创造方法上的成就也是很大的，无论在舞蹈、音乐、舞台美术各方面，都鲜明地表现着非洲特色。作曲家卡拉耶夫对于非洲音乐有很深的研究，这个舞剧的乐曲当中，用了非洲黑人的民歌，在配器方面把非洲的敲击乐器用到交响乐里，显出非洲音乐特有的节奏，加强了这个舞剧应有的民族色彩，并使音乐和剧情结合得十分紧密。有一位音乐家对我说，这个舞剧音乐的布局特别好，而且对人物的介绍和描写，都有鲜明的音乐形象，这是极为难能而可贵的。
    “雷电的道路”舞蹈的编排也有独特的风格，非洲民族形式的舞蹈和脚尖舞巧妙的配合着，创造出各种人物的形象。无论是群舞、独舞、双人舞，都是根据舞剧的主题思想安排得非常恰当。每一个登场人物的思想感情都能从舞蹈动作看得清楚。舞蹈和音乐的进行非常谐和而优美，并显示了严肃的斗争气氛。沙丽和连尼的悲剧概括地说明了种族间和阶级间的矛盾，可是沙丽（奥·瓦·列皮辛斯卡娅扮演）和连尼（康·米·谢尔盖耶夫扮演）恋爱场面的一段双人舞，真是美极了！特别好的是感情发展的层次异常分明：最初有很多的顾虑，一步一步撇开了顾虑，彼此表示真诚相爱，再进一步相互倾心不顾一切，他们勇敢地对殖民主义者、种族主义者表示了强烈的反抗，还有一点令人感动的，黑人马柯故意和地主的打手搏斗，掩护了这对情人，以致自己受伤。这种地方并不多费笔墨，有力地表现出阶级和种族的友爱，却又是非常有力的一笔。观众都不自觉的同声叫“好”！
    “宝石花”和“雷电的道路”是两个完全不同风格的戏，可是有它共同之美。第一就是音乐和舞蹈做到了毫发无间的一致——演员、乐队、乐队指挥在思想、感情、理解、节奏、技巧等方面完全一致。第二、舞蹈能够跟主题思想、人物的生活、感情、毫发无间的紧密结合。戏一开场观众就不知不觉进到戏里去，同剧中人呼吸相通，打成一片。我就是这样，看了一两场戏之后就忘掉了台上是在舞蹈，因为艺术的真实和观众的感情融洽在一处，台上台下彼此相忘，这也就是所谓艺术的最高境界吧！要做到以上那样就必须经过严格的技术锻炼，还要有充分的艺术修养，尤其重要的是要有马克思列宁主义的思想为骨干。苏联芭蕾的高度思想性和高度的艺术性有机的结合，是我们学习的榜样。传统的悠久积累的深厚，规模的宏大，技术的高超，也是有目共睹的。苏联芭蕾不能不说是世界第一。
