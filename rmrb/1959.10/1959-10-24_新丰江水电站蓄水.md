Xinhua News Agency Report: The Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station in Guangdong, which is under construction, officially closed its gates to impound water on the 20th.

Impounding water is crucial to ensuring the smooth power generation of the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station next year. According to calculations, for every 5.5 cubic meters of water additionally impounded now, one more kilowatt-hour of electricity can be generated next year.

After impounding water, the construction of the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station has entered a new stage. The civil engineering work for the No. 1 turbine generator set has been largely completed, and the installation of the spiral case of the first turbine generator set is now underway. The workers have proposed to complete the installation of the first turbine generator set ten days ahead of schedule by the end of this year.

The civil engineering excavation work for the hub switch station is also being accelerated.

The Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station, a large-scale hydropower station, is one of China's key construction projects. After its complete construction, it will generate 1.172 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which can meet the industrial and agricultural electricity needs of Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Shantou, and other regions.

    新丰江水电站蓄水
    据新华社讯　建设中的广东新丰江水电站20日正式下闸蓄水。
    下闸蓄水是确保新丰江水电站在明年顺利发电的关键。据计算，现在能多蓄五点五立方米的水，明年就能多发一度电。
    下闸蓄水后，新丰江水电站建设工程又进入了一个新的阶段。一号水轮机组的土建工程已大部完毕，正在开始安装第一台水轮机组的蜗壳部分。工人们提出要提前十天在今年年底完成第一台水轮机组的安装任务。
    枢纽开关站的土建开挖工程，也正在加紧进行。
    新丰江水电站这个大型水电站是我国重点建设工程之一。它全部建成之后，每年能发电十一亿七千二百万度，可以满足广州、韶关、汕头等地区的工农业用电需要。（附图片）
