Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Dispatch: The QianDongNan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of mid-season rice. Whether on the terraced fields of the Miao Mountains or the flat, spacious banks of the QingShui River, news of mid-season rice exceeding the targets set by the "National Agricultural Development Program" and breaking the "1,000 Jin" barrier is spreading everywhere. As of September 24th, after verification by more than 7,000 acceptance groups from the prefecture, county, and commune levels, the 1,110,000 mu of mid-season rice already harvested across the prefecture averaged 903 jin per mu. JianHe County, where the Miao people are concentrated, has had a particularly good harvest of mid-season rice this year. The current harvested area already exceeds three-quarters of the total area, with an average yield as high as 1,316 jin per mu. In HuangPing, ZhenYuan, JinPing, and LiPing counties, the yield of mid-season rice is above 800 jin per mu. The average yield of these harvested mid-season rice fields has broken the contracted yield targets, generally increasing by about 30% compared to the exceptionally abundant harvest of last year. Among them, 75,462 mu yielded between 1,000 jin and 1,200 jin per mu, 67,674 mu yielded between 1,200 jin and 1,500 jin per mu, and 6,611 mu yielded between 1,500 jin and 2,000 jin per mu. In addition, some high-yield fields with yields of over 3,000 jin per mu have emerged. Based on the acceptance and harvesting situation in various places, it is estimated that the output of mid-season rice alone will approach the total grain output of the entire prefecture last year.

    In the days of celebrating the great harvest, people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture attribute the victory to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and hail the fruitful results of the people's communes. A mountain song is circulating in many places: "The people's commune is powerful, the program targets are surpassed in two years, never has there been a year as good as this, the bumper harvest is all thanks to communization."

    The QianDongNan area has poor natural conditions, large climate changes, and frequent disasters. Last year, the people's commune system was implemented, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture was fully implemented, and cultivation methods were improved. First, the prefecture organized 500,000 people to camp in the fields and fight for more than a month, generally deep plowing more than 2 million mu of paddy fields to about eight cun (approximately 10 inches), with the high-yield fields, accounting for 30% of the rice planting area, deep plowed to more than one chi (approximately 13 inches). Facts have proved that all fields that have been deep plowed to more than one chi, coupled with other effective measures, have yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. This year, rice was generally densely planted with about 15,000 seedlings per mu, about double the number of last year. In order to meet the needs of dense planting, a manure accumulation campaign was also carried out before and after transplanting, so that each mu of mid-season rice was fertilized with more than 20,000 jin of manure. These measures have all promoted high yields of rice.

    The people's communes also exerted unparalleled power in overcoming various natural disasters. The prefecture suffered from floods in the spring, droughts in the summer, and insect plagues in August. Thanks to the people's communes extensively organizing large-scale cooperation to prevent floods, fight droughts, and eliminate insects, the bumper harvest was preserved.

    This newspaper reports: In Eshan Yi Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, more than 51,000 mu of the 95,000 mu of mid-season rice have been harvested, with an average yield of 812 jin per mu, an increase of 33% compared to last year, and a large area of more than 20,000 mu has emerged with yields above 1,000 jin per mu. Eshan County, located in a mountainous area, has seen the best growth of mid-season rice this year than any other year. Generally, each ear has an average of 150 to 200 grains, and the most have 300 to 500 grains. The ChengGuan Management Area of the ChengGuan Commune in the dam area, with more than 2,200 mu, has an average yield of 1,005 jin per mu, and more than 40 mu have reached an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu.

    Eshan County established six people's communes last autumn, creating superior conditions for the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. From last winter to this spring, the communes concentrated manpower and material resources to carry out large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction, self-repairing and renovating more than 1,400 water conservancy projects, storing more than 50 million cubic meters of water, ensuring that the county's 95,000 mu of paddy fields, in the case of low rainfall, still completed transplanting two solar terms earlier than in the past. In the past, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources in the cooperatives, digging fields was generally only four or five cun deep, and 30% of the county's fields were planted with seedlings in shallow water every year. After communization, the commune coordinated labor and material resources, organized cooperation between mountainous and dam areas, ensuring that 95% of the fields were deep plowed to eight cun to one chi, and sufficient base fertilizer was generally applied, basically eliminating shallow water transplanting. In terms of variety and dense planting measures, the commune made unified plans this year, making arrangements according to local conditions. Indica rice was planted in the plains, and cold-resistant japonica rice was planted in the mountains; the density of planting was also increased by 30% to 40% compared to the past. Mid-season cultivation was grasped in a timely and meticulous manner. By the end of August, four weedings had been basically completed, and fertilizer was applied twice, achieving timely irrigation and drainage, so that the county's rice achieved a particularly abundant harvest on the basis of last year's bumper harvest.

    西南方传来中稻高产喜讯
    黔东南自治州一百多万平均亩产九百斤
    峨山自治县两万多亩亩产超过千斤大关
    据新华社贵阳电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州，中稻获得空前大丰收。不论在梯田层叠的苗岭山上，还是在平坦宽敞的清水江边、中稻超过“农业发展纲要”规定的指标、和突破“千斤”的丰收喜讯到处传来。到9月24日止，分别经过州、县公社的七千多个验收组验收，全州已收割的一百一十一万亩中稻，平均亩产九百零三斤。苗族聚居的剑河县今年中稻收成特别好，目前收获面积已超过总面积四分之三，平均亩产高达一千三百一十六斤。黄平、镇远、锦屏和黎平等县，中稻每亩单产都在八百斤以上。这些已收割的中稻，平均亩产都突破了包产指标，一般亩产比特大丰收的去年增加三成左右，其中亩产一千斤至一千二百斤的有七万五千四百六十二亩，一千二百斤至一千五百斤的有六万七千六百七十四亩，一千五百斤至二千斤的有六千六百一十一亩，此外还出现了一些亩产三千斤以上的高额丰产田。根据验收和各地收获的情况来看，预计仅中稻一项，就将接近去年全州粮食总产量。
    在喜庆大丰收的日子里，全州各族人民把胜利归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，欢呼人民公社结出了丰硕的果实，许多地方都流传这样一首山歌：“人民公社威力大，纲要指标两年跨，自古那有今年好，丰收全靠公社化。”
    黔东南地区自然条件较差，气候变化大，灾害较多。去年实现了人民公社化，充分贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，改进了耕作方法。首先，全州组织了五十万人在田间扎营，奋战一个多月，将二百余万亩水田普遍深翻八寸左右，占水稻种植面积30％的丰产田深耕一尺以上，事实证明，凡是深耕一尺以上的田，加上其他有效措施，亩产都超过了千斤。今年水稻密植一般是每亩种一万五千蔸左右，比去年约增加一倍。为了适应密植的需要，在插秧前后，还开展了积肥运动，使每亩中稻施肥达二万余斤。这些措施都促使水稻高产丰收。
    人民公社在战胜各种自然灾害中也发挥了无比威力。全州今年春天闹水灾，夏天闹旱灾，8月份又闹虫灾，由于人民公社广泛组织大协作，防洪抗旱灭虫，保住了丰收。
    本报讯　云南省峨山彝族自治县九万五千多亩中稻，已经收割五万一千多亩，平均亩产达到八百一十二斤，比去年增产33％，并出现了二万多亩亩产千斤以上的大面积丰产片。地处山区的峨山县，今年中稻的成长比任何一年好。一般平均每穗有一百五十粒到二百粒，最多的每穗有三百到五百多粒。坝区城关公社城关管理区二千二百多亩，平均亩产一千零五斤，有四十多亩达到平均亩产两千斤。
    峨山县去年秋天建立了六个人民公社，为全面贯彻实行农业“八字宪法”创造了优越条件。去冬今春，各公社集中人力、物力大搞农业水利建设、自修和整修了一千四百多处水利工程，蓄水五千多万立方，保证了全县九万五千亩稻田在少雨的情况下，仍然比过去提早两个节令结束插秧。过去合作社时由于人力、物力的限制，挖田一般只挖四、五寸深，全县每年都有30％的田栽白水秧，公社化以后，公社统筹劳力、物力，组织山区、坝区协作，保证了95％的田做到深耕八寸到一尺，普遍施足了底肥，基本上消灭了白水插秧。在品种和密植措施上，今年由公社统一规划，因地制宜地作了安排，平原地区栽种籼稻、山区栽种耐寒的粳稻良种；密植程度也比过去增加了30％到40％。中耕抓的及时细致，8月底基本上薅完了四道草，追了两次肥，做到适时灌水、排水，使全县的稻谷在去年丰收的基础上，又获得了特大丰收。
