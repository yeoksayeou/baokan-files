　　Spain Under Fascist Rule
　　Editor's Note: The American "Washington Post" published a dispatch on October 4 by French journalist Danielle Hunebelle, describing the corrupt scene in Spain under Franco's fascist rule and the suffering of people from all walks of life in Spain. A summary of this dispatch is as follows:
　　After twenty years of bloody rule, Spain has become an inhuman world where everything is turned upside down. In this country, farmers are illiterate. 70% of the machines in factories are seventy years old. Millions of dollars are spent building mausoleums, but the living can only afford beans.
　　The number of Spanish newspapers is now half of what it was in 1936. Many residents still do not know the name of the capital. Here, all explanations about life are still those from the time of St. Thomas Aquinas (13th-century Italian theologian – editor's note). Armed police—"defenders of Western and Catholic civilization"—work as bill collectors for gas companies in the afternoon and as doormen at night.
　　The express train from Barcelona to Madrid is three hours slower than in 1935. Here, football players are the highest-paid athletes in Europe. Here, people buy a little sugar or coffee whenever they have a little money to spend. Here, the mourning period for the death of Pope Pius XII is twice as long as in Italy, but the Pope's speeches are censored whenever they mention freedom.
　　Here, a Minister of Commerce can become a millionaire in just a few months. An unmarried couple has to wait ten years to get married. Sports newspapers have a larger circulation than the largest domestic newspaper. Soldiers work as waiters in theaters.
　　In this country, according to official figures, there is a shortage of 26,000 elementary schools. Here, only one woman—a nun—has the title of university professor. Spain has the lowest level of education in Europe.
　　Here, generals are also directors of boards. Here, the number of maids is five times the number of cars, and a pound of meat costs the equivalent of one and a half days' wages for a worker.
　　Here, socialites boast of dowries worth thousands of U.S. dollars when they get married—embroidered bed sheets, tablecloths, shirts, and jewelry. Poor housewives pawn their husbands' Sunday pants on Mondays and redeem them on Saturdays.
　　Here, landlords' estates stretch for thousands of hectares, three hundred people control the boards of major companies, and five banks control commerce and industry. In this country, the most expensive cars and the worst steel in the world are produced. Here, the average income per person is the lowest in Europe.
　　In theory, education is free and compulsory in Spain. In reality, the number of illiterates is very high (as high as 70% in Andalusia). In every city, there are thousands of children wandering the streets all day because there are no places in schools. Teachers' salaries are so low that 6,000 teachers requested to resign last October.
　　In the countryside, local teachers usually make some kind of arrangement with the priest or the largest shopkeeper and then go to the nearest city to teach private school. Even in Madrid, it is generally believed that children should pay teachers some money to help them barely make a living. In this "economic paradise," everyone relies on the charity of others: shop assistants rely on tips, factory workers rely on the generosity of their bosses, and school teachers rely on the voluntary help of students' parents.
　　The situation in secondary schools is even more serious. Seville has 500,000 residents, but only two public secondary schools. The school buildings of the two schools are dilapidated and in urgent need of repair. The tuition fees for all other schools (85% of education is in the hands of the church) are very high.
　　What about the quality? In Spain, many teachers either sacrificed in the civil war or are in exile. It will take one or two generations to train new teachers. Inspectors visit schools every year to carefully measure the area of the classrooms and inspect the ventilation of the toilets, but in the past twenty years, no one has ever understood the situation of the teachers.
　　As for teaching methods, they rely entirely on memory. They promote rote learning methods instead of enlightening students' minds. Everything is summarized into a limited number of fixed questions and answers. Thinking is not allowed, reasoning is forbidden, and criticism is blasphemy. Students do not write a single essay during their two years of studying philosophy.
　　In the question-and-answer teaching in the lowest class, you can see a list of fourteen nouns to avoid using: Darwinism, liberalism, socialism, positivism, etc. Religious and political training courses and examinations are compulsory, even throughout the four years of university.
　　You must not say that workers are favored in this upside-down world, although they can receive various additional subsidies, enjoy free medical treatment, and their wages are always doubled when they have children.
　　Take Pedro as an example. He has five children. He works in a cork factory in Catalonia. He earns three hundred and twenty-five pesetas (Spanish currency) per week, plus one hundred and fifty pesetas in overtime pay and a family allowance of one thousand one hundred and seventy pesetas per month from the boss.
　　For a family of seven, the total is three thousand and seventy pesetas per month, while in this city, bread is three point three pesetas per pound and beef is forty-five pesetas per pound. Pedro's entire salary is spent on food.
　　When I asked Pedro what his hopes were, he replied, "I hope to win the lottery!"
　　I forgot to mention that the most striking item on a Spanish worker's salary slip is this: "Employer's voluntary donation." This is a local custom. Because the minimum legal wage is not enough to maintain a person's livelihood, the boss practices charity.
　　I know a factory owner in Barcelona who doubles the wages of fifty workers out of his own pocket every month. He said to me, "Otherwise, they will have to find work elsewhere."
　　Even in universities, every lecturer earns one thousand five hundred pesetas per month, and professors receive an additional three hundred pesetas per month for research work. Obviously, other ways must be found to maintain their lives.
　　Therefore, in Spain, everyone has two jobs, working fifteen hours a day. To put it plainly, in Spain, work is divided into two aspects: on the one hand, it is eight hours of work to do as little work as possible in order to rest; on the other hand, it is private work, where people work like crazy in order to get a decent salary.
　　A factory worker works as a stretcher-bearer, a cafe waiter, a dance hall trumpeter, and an electrical installer; soldiers work as bookstore salespersons; surveyors design for the municipal building and teach drawing at the local high school; a factory manager manages the accounts of another factory and also manages a football team; a philosophy professor works for a publisher; a law professor practices as a lawyer; a university literature professor teaches at a middle school and works as a translator. All of this makes productivity unimaginably low, neurasthenia is very common, and people are exhausted.
　　The cost of living and wages are likely to be completely disproportionate. The greatest wishes of Spanish workers are "not having to buy shoes on credit" or "buying a bicycle to ride to work."
　　The wealthy live extravagant lives. Even now, you can still find families employing fifteen to twenty servants: three chauffeurs, two butlers, a chef, two maids, two porters, two attendants, a laundress, an ironing girl, a tailor, a nanny, a nanny for older children, and in the countryside, there is also a steward and his assistant.
　　Spaniards in the Franco era were deprived of freedom of the press (even advertisements are subject to censorship). They cannot express their opinions or listen to others' opinions. There are no accurate statistics. There is no transportation to get to work. Even with a job, you cannot live a decent life.
　　But what about the rich, the heads, and the responsible authorities? Franco did not act as an economist but as a bandit dividing the spoils among the victors of the civil war: the army specializes in maintaining order, the priests specialize in education, the landlords monopolize the land, and the bankers control commerce and industry. In the past twenty years, the profits they have gained in this economically isolated country are simply unbelievable.
　　The Ministry of Commerce is a bastion of this corruption. Corruption starts from the top—they make a fortune by black marketeering the rights to import wheat, vegetables, oil, and machinery—all the way down to retailers who play tricks on the scales.
　　But the situation is more than just this. There are tax inspectors who only earn one thousand five hundred pesetas per month but live like kings; some import companies are actually offices set up for ministers, and their main business is selling licenses; some fertilizer distribution officials supply fertilizer to the best areas in the country so that they can later sell the fertilizer to the authorities in the worst areas at three times the price.
　　Officers and soldiers in the army can buy U.S. dollars for ten pesetas and then sell them for sixty-two or sixty-three pesetas; customs personnel require bribes; licenses can be bought; there is a black market for importing cars (one hundred thousand pesetas can get you a license to import fifty cars); financial fraud—the most recent one was a transaction with the Swiss Banking Association, which involved one thousand three hundred people who smuggled millions of pesetas out of the country, including generals, senior officials, religious leaders, well-known doctors, lawyers, etc.
　　However, there is opposition. All newspapers are talking about this issue. The Spanish people are anti-Franco, and only 30% of them would support him if free elections were held.
　　Franco realizes that forced methods are not cost-effective when he has to feel uneasy about world opinion. He now wants an opposition.
　　This opposition is almost entirely made up of the middle and upper classes.
　　The peseta is worthless. The shortage of in-demand currency has brought the country to the brink of chaos. Obviously, the current situation where comedy and tragedy are separated by only a layer of paper cannot last.

### 法西斯统治下的西班牙

专栏：外论摘要

　　法西斯统治下的西班牙
    编者按：美国“华盛顿邮报”10月4日刊载了法国女记者达尼埃勒·乌内贝勒写的一篇通讯，描述了佛朗哥法西斯统治下西班牙的一片糜烂景象和西班牙各阶层人民遭受的苦难。这篇通讯摘要如下：
    二十年的血腥统治，西班牙已成为一切都颠倒了的非人世界。在这个国家里，农民一字不识。工厂中的机器有70％已有七十年高龄。数以百万计的钱用来建筑陵墓，但是活人只吃得起豆子。
    现在西班牙报纸的数量只有1936年的一半。有许多居民现在还不知道首都的名字。在这里，一切关于人生的解释还是圣·汤姆斯·阿奎纳斯（十三世纪意大利神学家——编者注）时代的解释。武装警察——“西方和天主教文明的保卫者”——下午给煤气公司当收账员，晚上当看门人。
    从巴塞罗那到马德里的快车要比1935年慢三小时。在这里，足球运动员是欧洲收入最多的运动员。在这里，人们只要有一点钱可花，就买一点点糖或者咖啡。在这里，哀悼教皇庇护十二世逝世的时间比意大利长两倍，但是，教皇发表的演说只要是谈到了自由，就要遭到删改。
    在这里，一个商业部长在短短的几个月内就能成为一个百万富翁。一对未婚夫妻要结婚得等上十年。体育报纸比国内最大的报纸销数还大。兵士在戏院中担任服务员。
    在这个国家，据官方说法，缺少二万六千所小学。这里只有一个妇女——一个修女——有大学教授的头衔。西班牙的教育水平是欧洲最低的。
    在这里，将军同时又是董事会的董事。在这里，女仆的数目为汽车的五倍，一磅肉的价格相当于一个工人一天半的工资。
    在这里，社会名媛在结婚的时候，要夸耀价值成千上万美元的嫁奩——绣花被单、台布、衬衣和首饰。而穷人家的主妇星期一把她们丈夫星期日穿的裤子拿去当掉，星期六又赎出来。
    在这里，地主的庄园连绵数千公顷，三百个人统治着各大公司的董事会，五家银行统治着商业和工业。在这个国家里，生产着世界上最贵的汽车和世界上最坏的钢。在这里，每人平均收入是欧洲最低的。
    从理论上说，在西班牙受教育是免费的和强迫的。而实际上，文盲数目很大（在安达鲁西亚高达70％）。在每一座城市里，有成千上万的儿童终日在街头游荡，因为学校没有位置。教师的薪金非常低微，以至去年10月有六千名教员要求离职。
    在乡村，当地教师通常同牧师或最大的店主做出某种安排，然后到最近的城市去教私学。甚至在马德里，人们都普遍认为，儿童应该付给教师一些钱，帮助他们勉强糊口，在这个“经济天堂”里，每一个人都仰仗别人的施舍生活：店员靠小费，工厂工人靠老板的慷慨，学校教员靠学生父母的自愿帮助。
    中等学校的状况更为严重。在塞维拉有五十万居民，但是只有两所公立中学，两个学校的校舍陈旧不堪，急需修缮。所有其他学校（85％的教育掌握在教会手里）的学费十分高昂。
    质量如何呢？在西班牙，许多教师不是在内战中牺牲，就是流亡在外。新教师还要一两代才能培养出来。督学每年都到各校巡视一番，仔细丈量一下教室的面积和视察厕所的通风状况，但是在过去二十年，从来没有人了解一下教师的情况。
    至于教学方法，他们完全凭记忆，他们是推广鹦鹉学舌的方法，而不是启发学生的智慧。每一件事情都归纳成为一些有限的固定的问答。不许思考，禁止推理，而批评就是犯亵渎罪。学生在学哲学的两年期间，连一篇文章都没有写过。
    在最低班的问答教学中，你可以看到有一张避免使用的十四个名词的表：达尔文主义、自由主义、社会主义、实证主义等等。宗教和政治训练的课程和考试都是强迫的，甚至在大学整个四年期间都是如此。
    你决不能说，在这个颠倒的世界里，工人是得宠的，虽然他们可以领取各种额外补贴，他们享受免费医疗待遇，而且当他们有了孩子的时候，工资总是加倍。
    举佩德罗为例，他有五个孩子。他在加泰罗尼亚一家软木塞工厂做工。他每周赚三百二十五比塞塔（西币），外加一百五十比塞塔的加班费和老板给的每月一千一百七十比塞塔的家庭津贴。
    一家七口，每月共三千零七十比塞塔，而在这个城市，面包是每磅三点三比塞塔，牛肉每磅四十五比塞塔。佩德罗的工资全都买了吃的。
    当我问佩德罗有什么奢望时，他回答说，“我希望中彩票！”
    我忘记提到，一个西班牙工人工资单上最令人注目的就是这个项目：“雇主自愿捐助”。这是当地的惯例。因为最低的法定工资不足以维持一个人的生计，于是老板便实行施舍。
    我认识巴塞罗那一个工厂厂主，每月掏自己的腰包加倍发给五十名工人的工资。他对我说：“否则，他们便要到别处找工作。”
    甚至在大学也是这样，在那里每一个讲师每月赚一千五百比塞塔，教授每月另有三百比塞塔做研究工作。显然，还必须想出另外的办法来维持他们的生活。
    因此在西班牙每个人有两个工作，每天工作十五小时。说得明白些，在西班牙，工作分成两个方面：一方面是尽量少做工作以便休息的八小时工作；另一方面是私下工作，人们为了取得一笔像样的工资而像疯子一样地工作着。
    一个工厂工人做担架员，咖啡馆的侍者，舞厅的喇叭手和电气安装工、士兵做书店的售书员，测绘员为市政大厦设计并在当地中学教绘画；工厂经理管理另一家工厂的账目，也管理足球队；哲学教授替出版商工作；法律教授开业当律师；大学里的文学教授在中学兼课并做翻译工作。这一切使得生产率低得不堪设想，神经衰弱非常普遍，人们疲劳不堪。
    生活费用和工资可能是完全不成比例的西班牙工人，最大的愿望就是“不必赊购鞋子”或“买一辆自行车好骑着去工作”。
    富豪们过着穷奢极侈的生活。即使现在，仍然可以找到雇有十五个到二十个仆人的家庭：三个汽车司机、两名管家、一个厨师、两名使女、两个门房、两个听差、一个洗衣妇、一个烫衣姑娘、一个裁缝、一个保姆、一位照顾大孩子的保姆，如果在乡下，还有管事和他的助手。
    佛朗哥时代的西班牙人被剥夺了新闻自由（甚至连广告都要受检查）。他们不能表达自己的意见或者听别人的意见。没有任何正确的统计。没有到工作地点去的交通设备。即使有了职业，也不能过一个像样的生活。
    但是，富人、首脑们和负责当局又怎么样呢？佛朗哥不是作为一个经济学家而是作为一个匪首把赃物分给内战的胜利者的：军队专管维持秩序，牧师专管教育，地主垄断土地，商业和工业由银行家掌管。在过去二十年中在这个经济上闭关自守的国家他们获得的利润简直令人难以相信。
    商业部是这种贪污腐化的堡垒。贪污腐化从最上面的头脑起——他们把输入小麦、蔬菜、石油和机械的权利拿来做黑市生意从而大发其财——一直到在秤上玩花样的零售商为止。
    但是情况还不止这一些。有每月只拿一千五百比塞塔的税务稽查，生活得像国王一样；有的进口公司实际上是为部长们分设的办事处，它们的主要业务是出售执照；有的化学肥料分配官员把肥料供给国内条件最好的地区，以便他们以后能够把肥料以三倍的高价卖给条件最差地区的当局。
    军队中的官兵可以用十个比塞塔买进美元，然后以六十二个或者六十三个比塞塔卖出；海关工作人员非贿赂不行；执照可以买得到；输入汽车有黑市（花十万比塞塔能弄到一张进口五十辆汽车的执照）；财政舞弊——最近的一次是与瑞士银行联合会的交易，这次舞弊案牵涉到一千三百人，他们把数以百万计的比塞塔偷运出国，其中有将军、高级官员、宗教界领袖、著名医生、律师等。
    不过反对的力量是存在的。所有报纸都在谈这个问题。西班牙人民是反佛朗哥的，如果举行自由选举的话，只会有30％的人支持他。
    佛朗哥认识到，在不得不对世界舆论感到不安的时候，强迫的办法是不划算的，他现在希望有一个反对派。
    这个反对派差不多完全是由中产阶级和上层阶级组成的。
    比塞塔一文不值。吃香的货币缺乏的程度已使这个国家处在混乱的边缘。很明显，目前这种喜剧和悲剧只隔着一层纸的局面是不能持久的。　（新华社）（附图片）
