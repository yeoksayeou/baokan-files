Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 26th. Our correspondent Li Nan reports: As the Soviet people face the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution, the scene is that the Soviet economy is developing at an unprecedented speed and scale, vigorously catching up with the United States, and soaring high.

	Industrial Production Growth Exceeds Expectations
	One Year Equals the Past Ten or Twenty Years
	The Soviet Union's industrial production plan for this year has been completed very well. According to statistics, the current completion rate is 104%, and the growth rate is 12%. According to the original plan, the growth rate this year was about 8%. This means that the actual growth rate this year will be 50% higher than the original plan.
	Not only the speed, but also the magnificence of the scale is amazing. According to materials in the Soviet press, for example, in 1952, every 1% increase in Soviet industrial products was worth 5 billion rubles; this year, every 1% increase is worth 11 billion rubles. According to this figure, this year's Soviet industrial output value will increase by more than 133 billion rubles compared to last year.
	The following statistical materials are sufficient to summarize the trend of the vigorous advancement of the Soviet economy. According to relevant materials, since the beginning of the Soviet oil industry more than 100 years ago, the total oil extraction volume has reached 113 million tons; while the oil production volume will increase by 127 million tons during the Seven-Year Plan. In the electricity industry, the annual output has only reached 233 billion kilowatt-hours in more than 100 years, but the electricity output will increase by 287 billion kilowatt-hours during the Seven-Year Plan. The increase in the production of other products such as cement, gas, and coal during the Seven-Year Plan exceeds the production achieved in the past 100 years. This means that the industrial output of one year now equals the output of the past ten or twenty years.
	The output of many important industrial products in the Soviet Union this year has increased rapidly compared to last year, and the output of oil, gas, and electricity, which are the focus of development, has increased even more rapidly. In the past nine months of this year, the output of gas, oil, electricity, and chemical products has been roughly the same as the total output of the entire year last year. In addition, steel production increased by 3.6 million tons compared to the same period last year, iron increased by 2.7 million tons, coal increased by 8.6 million tons, and cement increased by 4.2 million tons.

	Production and Basic Construction Accelerate
	Equipment and Enterprise Management Improve
	Since the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held at the beginning of this year, especially after the Sixth Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Soviet Union has achieved new development in increasing production and practicing economy, strengthening technological progress, and improving enterprise management. First, all regions complete the plan ahead of schedule every month. In order to achieve the proposed goals of increasing production and practicing economy, all regions have taken concrete measures and actions. For example, the movement to review internal potential of enterprises in the Vladimir Oblast, the movement to review the technical level of products in the Sverdlovsk Oblast, and the movement to complete the Seven-Year Plan for improving labor productivity two years ahead of schedule in the Leningrad Oblast have greatly promoted the increase in production speed. Second, all regions have strengthened the supervision of production by primary Party organizations and strengthened the promotion of technological progress by the masses of enterprise workers. Primary Party organizations in various regions have successively organized supervision committees, and large numbers of workers in various regions have also established technical promotion committees and comprehensive work teams. For example, more than 3,000 primary supervision committees have been organized in Moscow, with more than 16,000 Communist Party members participating in the supervision work at the primary level. Six hundred technical promotion committees have been organized in the Stalino Economic Region. The technical progress promotion committee of the Stalin Steel Factory has put forward suggestions for improving open-hearth furnaces, which can double the factory's steel output. Third, technological progress is being vigorously implemented, and hundreds of automated production lines have been put into production. Many exemplary fully automated factories are under construction. In the past, only two factories in Moscow produced automated production lines, but now the number has increased to five. Fourth, the speed of basic construction has been greatly accelerated compared to the past. The three blast furnaces that have been put into production this year, as well as open-hearth furnaces, coke ovens, etc., are generally completed 1 to 3 months ahead of the original plan, reaching an unprecedented speed in the history of construction. The construction period of thermal power plants has begun to be shortened to two to three years, compared to the past when it was generally five to seven years. Several large hydropower stations will also be completed one year or even more ahead of schedule. Fifth, scientific and technical design institutions are constantly strengthened, and the work of scientific institutions is increasingly closely integrated with production. All regions have transferred a large number of scientific and technical personnel to participate in design work and solve key problems in rapidly improving production.

	Workers and Peasants Work Enthusiastically
	Labor Competition Grows in Scale
	After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, coupled with specific organizational and technical measures, the magnificent development of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Soviet working people is a major feature of the new situation. At present, the forms of labor competition in the Soviet Union are diverse, and the number of participants has also increased compared to the past. More than 180,000 work teams across the country have participated in the "Communist Labor Team" competition, hundreds of thousands of people have participated in the Communist mutual assistance movement of advanced helping the backward, and millions of young people have participated in the "Communist Shock Worker" and "Youth League Shock Construction Site" movements. In addition, a large number of people also participate in the Seven-Year Plan Fund Accumulation Movement, the Youth League Savings Box Movement, and so on. Under the slogan of "Everyone occupies a position in the Seven-Year Plan," a large number of workers have formulated their own personal plans and are striving to complete the annual plan and the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.

	Economic Competition Prospects are Getting Better and Better
	Will Catch Up with the United States in Recent Years
	The speed of growth of the Soviet national economic sectors puts the economic competition of vigorously catching up with the United States in a new situation. The distance between the Soviet Union and the United States is rapidly shortening. According to Soviet press materials, the Soviet Union's industrial output in 1929 was about 62 years behind the United States; by 1957, it had been shortened to only 17 years. In 1953, the United States' industrial output was twice that of the Soviet Union, but by 1957 it had been shortened to only one time more. If calculated according to the 8.6% annual growth rate of the Seven-Year Plan, while the United States averages less than 2% annual growth, then by 1965, the United States' industrial production exceeding the Soviet Union will be shortened to a distance of less than two years. Now that the Soviet Union's industrial production growth rate has reached 12%, it is very clear that the Soviet Union will leave the United States behind in recent years. By 1965, it will not be the United States exceeding the Soviet Union by two years, but the Soviet Union exceeding the United States by many years.

    十月革命节前夕一片美好景象
    苏联工业奔腾前进猛追美国
    新华社莫斯科26日电　本社记者李楠报道：在迎接十月革命四十二周年的日子，苏联人民面临的景象是：苏联的经济正以历史上未有的速度和规模向前发展，猛追美国，展翼高飞。
    工业增产速度超过预料
  一年等于过去一二十年
    苏联今年的工业生产计划完成情况非常好。据统计，现在完成计划的情况是104％，增长速度是12％。按照原定计划，今年增长的速度是8％左右。这就是说，今年实际上达到的增长速度将比原定计划还要多50％。
    不仅速度，而且规模的宏伟也是惊人的。据苏联报刊上的材料，如1952年苏联工业产品每增长1％，产值是五十亿卢布；那么，今年每增长1％，产值就是一百一十亿卢布。按照这个数字计算，今年苏联工业产值将比去年增加一千三百三十多亿卢布。
    下面的一个统计材料足以概括说明苏联经济力量奔腾前进的趋势。据有关方面的材料，苏联自有石油工业以来到现在一百多年，石油开采量才达到一亿一千三百万吨；而七年计划期间石油产量就要增加一亿二千七百万吨。电力工业一百多年来才达到每年产量二千三百三十亿度，但七年计划期间电力产量就要增加二千八百七十亿度。其他如水泥、瓦斯、煤等产品在七年计划期间增加的产量都超过历史上一百多年来达到的产量。这就是说，现在一年的工业产量等于历史上一、二十年的产量。
    苏联今年许多重要工业产品的产量都比去年提高很快，重点发展的石油、瓦斯、电力等的产量提高得更为迅速。今年九个多月来，瓦斯、石油、电力、化学产品的产量已和去年全年的总产量相差不多。其它如钢产量比去年同期增加了三百六十万吨，铁增加二百七十万吨，煤增加了八百六十万吨，水泥增加了四百二十万吨。
    生产和基本建设加快
  设备和企业管理改善
    自苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会在今年年初举行以来，特别是苏共中央六月全会以后，苏联在增产节约、加强技术进步、改善企业管理方面都取得了新的发展。首先，各个地区都每月提前超额完成计划。为实现提出的增产节约目标，各地都采取了具体的措施和行动。例如，弗拉基米尔州的审查企业内部潜力的运动，斯维德洛夫斯克州的审查产品技术水平的运动，列宁格勒州的提前两年完成提高劳动生产率七年计划的运动，都大大促进了生产速度的提高。其次，各地都加强了基层党组织对生产的监督工作，加强了企业职工群众对技术进步的推动工作。各地的基层党组织纷纷组织了监督委员会，各地职工也大批成立技术促进委员会和综合工作队。例如，莫斯科市已组织了三千多个基层监督委员会，有一万六千多名共产党员参加了基层监督的工作。斯大林诺经济区已组织了六百个技术促进委员会。在斯大林钢铁工厂的技术进步促进委员会订出了改进平炉的建议，这个建议可以使工厂的钢产量增加一倍。第三，技术进步正在大力贯彻，上百条自动化作业线已经投入生产。许多示范性的全部自动化工厂正在兴建。过去莫斯科只有两家工厂生产自动化作业线，现在已增加到五家。第四，基本建设的速度比过去大大加快。今年已经投入生产的三座高炉，以及平炉、炼焦炉等一般都比原定计划提前1月到3月建成，达到了过去建设史上未有的速度。火力发电站的建设期限已开始缩短成二年到三年，过去一般是五年到七年。几座大水电站也将提前一年或提前更多的时间完成。第五，科学和技术设计机构不断加强，科学机关的工作人员和生产结合得日益密切。各地都抽调了大批科学技术人员参加设计工作，解决迅速提高生产中的关键问题。
    工农群众干劲冲天
    劳动竞赛规模壮大
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，配合着组织上技术上的具体措施，苏联广大劳动人民的干劲的波澜壮阔的发展是新形势中的一大特色。目前苏联的劳动竞赛形式多种多样，参加的人数也比过去增多了。全国已有十八万多个工作队参加
  “共产主义劳动队”竞赛，有上百万人参加先进帮助落后的共产主义互助运动，有数百万青年参加“共产主义突击手”、“共青团突击工地”运动。其他，如积累七年计划基金运动、共青团储蓄箱运动等也有大量的人参加。在“每人在七年计划中占一个岗位”的口号下，大批的工人订立了自己的个人计划，为提前和超额完成年度计划和七年计划而奋斗。
  经济竞赛前景越来越好
  最近几年就将赶上美国
    苏联国民经济部门的这样增长的速度，就使得猛追美国的经济竞赛处在新的形势当中。苏美两国之间的距离正在急剧缩短。据苏联报刊材料，苏联1929年的工业产量大约比美国落后62年；到1957年已经缩短成只有17年。1953年美国的工业产量比苏联多出两倍，但到1957年已缩短成只多出一倍。如果根据七年计划每年增长8.6％计算，而美国每年平均增长不到2％，那么，到1965年，美国的工业生产超过苏联将缩短成不到两年的距离。现在，苏联的工业生产增长速度达到了12％，那么很显然，苏联在最近几年就会把美国抛在后面。到1965年将不是美国超过苏联两年，而是苏联超过美国好几年了。
