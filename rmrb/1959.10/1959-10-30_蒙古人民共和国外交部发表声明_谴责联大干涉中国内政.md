Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 29th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement today saying that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic firmly protests and opposes the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue" adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, and fully supports the statement issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China on October 23 on this issue.

The statement said that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue" discussed and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly under pressure from the United States is an illegal act that violates the United Nations Charter.

The statement pointed out that just as international tensions are tending to ease due to the efforts of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries, the adoption of the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue" shows that reactionary forces are attempting to return to the "Cold War" era and undermine the credibility of the United Nations.

The statement said that Tibet is an indivisible part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. Quelling the reactionary rebellion in Tibet instigated by imperialism and carrying out democratic reforms to make the Tibetan people prosperous and progressive is the internal affair of the People's Republic of China. The adoption of the so-called "Tibetan issue" resolution is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The statement said: "The Mongolian people and their government believe that the purpose of discussing the above-mentioned provocative proposal at the United Nations General Assembly is to undermine the increasingly developing and consolidating friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Asian countries, and to undermine the ever-expanding solidarity of the people of Asian and African countries who are opposing imperialism and colonialism."

    蒙古人民共和国外交部发表声明
    谴责联大干涉中国内政
    新华社乌兰巴托29日电　蒙古人民共和国外交部今天发表声明说，蒙古人民共和国政府坚决抗议和反对联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，完全支持中华人民共和国政府10月23日就这一问题发表的声明。
    声明说，蒙古人民共和国政府认为，联合国大会在美国压力下讨论通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议是违反联合国宪章的非法行为。
    声明指出，正当由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和爱好和平国家的努力，国际紧张局势趋向缓和的时候，通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议表明，反动势力企图重新回到“冷战”时期和破坏联合国的威信。
    声明说，西藏是中华人民共和国领土不可分割的一部分。平息在帝国主义煽动下在西藏发生的反动叛乱，进行使西藏人民繁荣、进步的民主改革，是中华人民共和国的内政。通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议是粗暴地干涉中华人民共和国内政。声明说：“蒙古人民及其政府认为，在联合国大会上讨论上述挑衅性的提案的目的在于：破坏中华人民共和国和亚洲各国日益发展和巩固的友谊合作，破坏正在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的亚非各国人民的日益扩大的团结。”
