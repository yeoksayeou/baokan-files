    Red Interplanetary Station Space Facsimile
    Back of the Moon First Appears to Mankind
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet automatic interplanetary station has photographed the far side of the Moon and transmitted it back to Earth from a distance of 470,000 kilometers via a radio facsimile system. From now on, mankind has seen the entire Moon for the first time.
    In order to photograph the Moon, the automatic interplanetary station was equipped with instruments for taking pictures of the far side of the Moon and sending them to Earth. On October 7, at 6:30 AM Moscow time, when the automatic interplanetary station was operating between the Moon and the Sun, with 70% of the far side of the Moon illuminated by the sun, the orientation system on the interplanetary station issued a special command, causing the camera to aim at the far side of the Moon, beginning approximately forty minutes of continuous photography work, obtaining a large number of lunar photographs in two sizes. At that time, the automatic interplanetary station was sixty to seventy thousand kilometers from the surface of the Moon.
    The development and fixing of the photographic film was carried out automatically on the interplanetary station. The interplanetary station sent back lunar image signals to Earth through a dedicated radio technology system. The facsimile instrument transmitted intermediate tones of the lunar image with a very high analytical capability.
    After preliminary arrangement, the first batch of photographs of the far side of the Moon were published in the Soviet "Pravda" and "Izvestia" on October 27, and will be published in scientific journals in the future.
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences has established a committee to name the craters and "seas" on the far side of the Moon.

    红色行星际站太空传真
    月宫背影初现人间
    综合新华社消息：苏联自动行星际站已经拍摄下月球背面的照片，远从四十七万公里外，通过无线电传真系统播送回地球。从此，人类第一次看到了月球的全貌。
    为了拍摄月球照片，自动行星际站上装备了拍摄月球背面照片和向地球发送照片的仪器。10月7日莫斯科时间六点三十分，当自动行星际站运行于月球和太阳之间、月球背面70％被太阳照射的时候，行星际站上的定向系统发出特别号令，使照像机对准月球背面，开始了持续约四十分钟的拍摄工作，获得了两种尺寸的、大量的月球照片。当时，自动行星际站距月球表面六万到七万公里。
    照片胶卷的显影和定影是在行星际站上自动进行的。行星际站通过专门的无线电技术系统，向地球发回了月球影像信号。传真仪器用很高的分析能力传回了中间色调的月球影像。
    经过初步整理，月球背面的第一批照片，10月27日刊在苏联“真理报”和“消息报”上，今后还将在科学刊物上发表。
    苏联科学院成立了委员会，给月球背面的寰形山、寰形“海”等命名。
