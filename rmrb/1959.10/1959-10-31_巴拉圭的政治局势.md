    The Political Situation in Paraguay
    Paraguay, Eweio Luomeiluo
    The struggle of the Latin American people for democracy and against imperialist infiltration is unfolding with great momentum. In this turbulent political situation, the struggle of the Paraguayan people occupies an important position.
    The most concrete manifestations of the rising Paraguayan people's movement are: the formation of the "National Liberation Front," which includes democratic forces from all national parties; the mobilization of millions of workers from seventy trade union organizations; and the peasant movements in the north and south regions. In particular, the fact that the masses are preparing for a decisive struggle to seize power is a problem that deeply worries imperialism.
    The Paraguayan people are struggling to establish a completely democratic system, hoping to solve the economic crisis through this path and find a way out of the intolerable backwardness, poverty, and suffering. This is precisely what frightens the imperialist monopoly capitalists, landlords, and big merchants.
    On a cultivable area of 385,000 square kilometers, there are only 1.5 million people, and they cultivate less than 1% of this cultivable land.
    There are four main types of production that dominate in Paraguay: First, large-scale animal husbandry based on large estate ownership, but the annual livestock breeding rate is very low. Second, small-scale agriculture. Cultivated with primitive tools and without fertilizers, mainly producing "yucca" (note) and corn for self-sufficiency. Third, logging and yerba mate harvesting, also under large estate ownership. Fourth, the processing and export of raw materials for livestock products, agricultural products, and forestry products, operated by foreign capital (American, British, Argentine, and Brazilian) companies. These companies own leased land and privileges, as well as their own port ownership. Moreover, most companies occupy large tracts of land and exercise autocratic rule on these lands, openly subsidizing government authorities.
    Paraguay has been and still is an object of imperialist covetousness. It possesses very rich natural resources, such as the territory called Chaco, which is one of the largest oil reserves on the continent. In addition, its geographical location gives it a high strategic value, which U.S. imperialism pays close attention to in its military plans to control South America. Paraguay is located in the heart of the continent, adjacent to Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its plan to turn Paraguay into a U.S.-controlled military base, so that when the democratic movements in these neighboring countries become unstoppable, Paraguay can become a threat to these countries. In addition, the United States is also attempting to use Paraguay as a fuel base for supplying its military aircraft and fleets operating in the South Atlantic. The routes across the Chaco, the oil pipeline between Paraguay and the U.S.-controlled Bolivian oil region, the routes between Asunción and Paranaguá (a port on the Atlantic coast of Brazil), the airports in Asunción and the Paraguayan Chaco, the oil concessions that the Stroessner government leased to monopoly enterprises represented by the Rockefeller Group and the Netherlands, the "U.S. Caribbean Military Region Command," and the huge work carried out by the U.S. "Military Delegation" in Paraguay among the leaders and officers of the Paraguayan army are all aspects of this plan. Through this plan, they are turning our country into an air base, a strategic transportation point in the interior of the continent, and a fuel depot for wartime. It must also be pointed out that the U.S. government has also formulated a plan to use the power resources of Salto del Guairá, at the border of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, to establish an atomic station for war purposes. This plan is still being kept secret. In order to implement this plan, the United States is shamelessly interfering in our country's political life.
    The Paraguayan military government, currently headed by the fascist General Alfredo Stroessner, is a tool of the "U.S. Action Committee in Paraguay." This committee is an official committee used by the Washington government to interfere in all Paraguayan state organs. On the other hand, Paraguay's economy is controlled by the "International Monetary Fund," whose economic policies, as it openly declares, are to "create a suitable climate" for the investment of various trusts in Paraguay.
    The Stroessner government and its military clique were directly formed by the U.S. Embassy in order to implement the orders of the "International Monetary Fund" and the "U.S. Action Committee in Paraguay." The most direct executor of these orders is the current Governor of the Central Bank, Ingeniero Gustavo Storm, who is closely colluding with the Rockefeller oil monopoly group. He established a free exchange system on the basis of the devaluation of the Uruguayan currency, which greatly facilitated American interventionists and the big bourgeoisie engaged in import trade. This policy has led to a sharp decline in the purchasing power of the people and continuous inflation, while ensuring the stable position of American capitalists who have enterprises in our country by assuring the outflow of dollars.
    Among the military men supporting the Stroessner dictator, there is also a general like the current Commander-in-Chief, Odgar Cabello, who is also a member of the U.S. Command Intelligence Bureau. In a formal speech at the South Atlantic Conference, he said: "In order to defend the continent and oppose communism, Paraguay should become an operating base for the U.S. Air Force due to its geographical location." This statement coincides with the attempt of the U.S. Embassy.
    Despite the massive use of terror and violence by the military dictator, he still cannot prevent the people's struggle, which has reached a considerable scale in recent months. To better understand the upsurge of the people's anti-dictatorship struggle, it is best to review a series of events over the past twelve years.
    As everyone knows, under the victorious influence of the people of all countries, led by the Soviet Union, in defeating German and Japanese imperialism in World War II, there was an upsurge of people's democratic movements in Latin America. The fascist military dictatorship in power at the time was forced to make certain concessions to various democratic parties, including the Communist Party, under the joint pressure of the working class, various political parties, and a group of young military officers. However, under the pressure of the U.S. Embassy, the government regained its strength and launched a fascist-style military coup on January 13, 1947, supported by reactionary landlords, plunging the country into a new abyss of terror and persecution.
    The people's answer was the uprising that broke out on March 8, 1947, with the support of the Communist Party. This uprising had every possibility of success, but due to the lack of unity and the wavering of the bourgeoisie and landlords participating in the struggle, the uprising failed. This was followed by a period of terror of suppressing the working class, arresting and massacring its leaders.
    Nevertheless, the people's struggle restarted in new forms, and the dictatorship was not consolidated. From 1948 to 1949, there were six government changes in Paraguay. From 1949 to 1954, the landlords held power. On May 4, 1954, the U.S. Embassy launched a new coup and brought the current military clique headed by General Stroessner to power. This general is closely colluding with American enterprises and has made many concessions to them.
    However, workers and peasants continue to struggle regardless of the suppression of the police agencies of the dictatorship, and the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of people is very high. The general strike in August-September 1958 marked a new and historically significant milestone in the struggle of the working class. This strike broke out under direct pressure from the masses, regardless of the brutal suppression of the dictator. Although the strike began with demands for wage increases, it soon turned into a political struggle for democracy and against dictatorial persecution. Workers took to the streets of the capital, Asunción, fighting with the police, and the residents of Asunción also poured into the streets to fight the tyrant's henchmen.
    It must also be noted here the profound impact of the Cuban Revolution on the people of our country. The Cuban Revolution showed the people of our country that military dictatorships supported by American bayonets can be overthrown through armed struggle.
    The future belongs to the struggle of the people with a high degree of political awareness. When it has been practically proven that the dictatorial government has blocked the road to a peaceful transition to a new democratic system with violent policies, the people of our country have very clearly realized that it is necessary to first solve the problem of political power.
    The Communist Party's "Paraguayan Unity News" wrote in August: "The people personally experience that violence from below must be used to answer violence from above. Criticism from public opinion and underground newspapers is not enough, and the people are preparing to use weapons to criticize the dictatorial government's criminal offensive."
    Now we are facing the beginning of a new period of the Paraguayan revolution.

    巴拉圭的政治局势
    巴拉圭　埃维奥·罗梅洛
    拉丁美洲人民群众争取民主、反对帝国主义渗入的斗争，波澜壮阔地开展起来，在这动荡的政治局势中，巴拉圭人民的斗争占着重要的地位。
    巴拉圭人民运动高涨的最具体的表现是：包括全国各政党中民主力量的“民族解放阵线”的组成；七十个工会组织中的千百万工人群众的动员；南北各区的农民运动。特别是群众为夺取政权而准备进行决定性斗争这一事实，都是使帝国主义深深感到焦虑的问题。
    巴拉圭人民为争取建立一个完全民主的制度而斗争，渴望通过这条道路来解决经济危机，为不可忍耐的落后、贫困、苦难的状况寻求一条出路。正是这点吓的帝国主义垄断资本家、地主以及大商人们惊慌失措。
    在三十八万五千平方公里这样大的可耕面积上，仅仅居住着一百五十万人口，而他们耕种的面积还不足这可耕土地的1％。
    在巴拉圭占统治地位的生产方式有四类：第一，建立在大庄园所有制基础之上的大规模的畜牧业，但是，每年牲畜的繁殖率很低。第二，小规模的农业。用原始工具耕种，没有肥料，主要是生产自给的“尤卡”（注）和玉米。第三，原木的采伐业和采马黛茶，也是大庄园所有制。第四，由外国资本（美国、英国、阿根廷和巴西等国）的公司经营的畜产品、农产品及林业产品的原料加工与出口业。这些公司都拥有租借地和特权以及自己的港口所有权。而且大部分公司都占有大片土地，并在这些土地上实行专制统治，公开给政府当局以津贴。
    巴拉圭过去和今天一直是帝国主义唾涎的对象。它拥有非常丰富的自然财富，如叫做厦谷的领土是大陆上最大石油蕴藏地之一。除此之外，它的地理位置也使它具有高度的战略价值，美帝国主义在它的控制南美的军事计划中，非常注意这一点。巴拉圭位于大陆的心脏地带，与阿根廷、巴西和玻利维亚相邻，因此，美帝国主义加紧进行把巴拉圭变为它控制的军事基地的计划，以便当这些邻国的民主运动一发而不可抑制的时候，巴拉圭这个军事基地就可以成为对这些邻国的威胁。此外，美国还企图利用巴拉圭成为供应他的军用飞机及在南大西洋活动的舰队的燃料基地。横贯厦谷的航线、巴拉圭与受美国企业控制的玻利维亚石油区之间的油管、亚松森与帕腊讷爪（巴西在大西洋沿岸的一个港口）之间的航线、亚松森及巴拉圭厦谷的机场、斯特罗斯纳政府租借给以洛克菲勒集团和荷兰为代表的垄断企业的石油租让地、“美国加勒比军区司令部”及美国驻巴拉圭的“军事代表团”在巴拉圭军队的首领及军官中所进行的巨大的工作等等，就是这个计划的几个方面。他们通过这个计划把我国变成一个空军基地，大陆内部的战略交通点和战时的燃料仓库。还必须指出，美国政府又制定了一个计划，企图利用巴拉圭、阿根廷和巴西交界地方的萨尔多·德尔·爪依拉的动力资源来建立一个为战争目的服务的原子站，这项计划至今还在保守秘密。为了执行这一计划，美国正在无耻地干涉我国的政治生活。
    目前以法西斯将军艾尔弗雷多·斯特罗斯纳为首的巴拉圭军政府，是“美国驻巴拉圭行动委员会”的工具。这个委员会是华盛顿政府用来干涉巴拉圭所有国家机关的一个官方委员会。另一方面，巴拉圭的经济受着“国际货币基金组织”的控制，这个组织的经济政策，正如它自己公开宣布的，是为各托辣斯向巴拉圭投资“制造适宜的气候”。
    斯特罗斯纳政府及其军事集团是美国大使馆为了执行“国际货币基金组织”及“美国驻巴拉圭行动委员会”的命令所一手直接组成的。这些命令的最直接的执行者就是现任中央银行行长英赫内罗·古斯塔沃·斯托恩，这个人是和洛克菲勒石油垄断集团紧紧勾结在一起的。他在乌拉圭货币贬值的基础上建立了自由兑换制，这大大地方便了美国干涉者及搞进口贸易的大资产阶级。这一政策一方面导致人民购买力的严重下降和通货不断膨胀，另一方面使美元不断外流，保证了在我国建有企业的美国资本家们的稳定地位。
    在支持斯特罗斯纳独裁者的军人当中，也竟有像现任总司令奥德加尔·卡贝约这样的将军，他也是美国司令部情报局的成员，他在南大西洋会议的一次正式演说中曾说：“为了保卫大陆和反对共产主义，巴拉圭由于他的地理位置应该成为美国空军的行动基地”，这一说法正和美国大使馆的企图不谋而合。
    尽管军事独裁者大量使用了恐怖和暴力手段，但仍不能阻止人民的斗争，这斗争在最近几个月来达到了相当大的规模。为了更好地了解人民反独裁斗争的高涨，最好还是回顾一下近十二年来的一系列事件。
    大家知道，在以苏联为首的各国人民在第二次世界大战中击败德日帝国主义的胜利影响下，在拉丁美洲出现了人民民主运动高涨的局面。当时执政的法西斯军事独裁在工人阶级、各个政党及一群年青军人的共同压力下曾被迫向包括共产党在内的各民主党派作了一定程度的让步。但是在美国大使馆的压力下，政府又重新聚集力量，在1947年1月13日发动了一次有反动地主支持的法西斯型的军事政变，使全国陷入一个新的恐怖与迫害的深渊之中。
    人民的回答则是1947年3月8日爆发的得到共产党的支持的起义。这次起义完全有着取得成功的可能，但是由于缺乏团结和参加斗争的资产阶级和地主的动摇，使这次起义失败了。随之而来的是一个镇压工人阶级、逮捕和屠杀其领袖的恐怖时期。
    尽管如此，人民的斗争又以新的形式重新开始了，独裁政权并没有得到巩固。从1948年到1949年，巴拉圭就曾发生了六次政府变动。从1949年到1954年则是地主掌握政权。1954年5月4日美国大使馆发动了一次新的政变，把现任的以斯特罗斯纳将军为首的军事集团扶植上台。这位将军是和美国企业紧紧勾结在一起的，并向美国企业做了许多让步。
    然而工人和农民仍然不顾独裁政权的警察机构的镇压继续进行斗争，广大人民群众的政治热情非常高涨。1958年8—9月的总罢工标志着工人阶级斗争的一个新的、具有历史意义的里程碑。这次罢工是在群众直接压力下，不顾独裁者的残酷镇压的情况下爆发的。虽然这次罢工是以要求增加工资开始的，但很快就变为一个要求民主、反对独裁迫害的政治斗争。工人们走向首都亚松森的大街与警察搏斗，亚松森的居民也涌向街头与暴君的巡捕们展开战斗。
    这里还必须注意到古巴革命对我国人民的深刻影响。古巴革命向我国人民显示了：通过武装斗争就可以推翻美国刺刀所支撑的军事独裁。
    前途是属于具有高度政治觉悟的人民的斗争的。当实际证明了独裁政府以暴力政策堵塞了向新的民主的制度实行和平过渡的道路的时候，我国人民就非常清楚地了解到必需首先解决政权问题。
    共产党的“巴拉圭团结报”在8月曾这样写道：“人民亲自体验到必须用来自下面的暴力来回答来自上面的暴力。舆论与地下报刊的批评已经是不够了，人民正在准备用武器来批评独裁政府罪恶的进攻。”
    现在我们正面临着巴拉圭革命的一个新时期的开始。
