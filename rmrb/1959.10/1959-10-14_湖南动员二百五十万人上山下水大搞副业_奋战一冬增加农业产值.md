Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. In the next three months, strive to have the average rural population of the province earn ten yuan in cash income from sideline occupations. This is the battle cry that the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee put forward to the province's farmers at a recent telephone conference to vigorously grasp sideline production. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to rationally arrange labor, extract 18% of the labor force, that is, more than 2.5 million people, and invest them in winter sideline production. Timely organize labor to go up the mountains to hunt, collect rosin, dig medicinal materials, go down to the lakes to catch fish and shrimp, and carry out a variety of sideline production activities such as short-distance transportation. Try every possible means to increase the income of commune members and invigorate the urban and rural economy. Now, all localities have taken active actions in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions.

This year, while focusing on grain production, the various communes in Hunan have never interrupted sideline production activities. During the tense agricultural season of August and September, the province's sideline income reached more than 70 million yuan, an increase of about half compared with the same period last year, making more than 90% of the province's commune members increase their income compared with last year, and invigorating the urban and rural economy. Therefore, although the planned purchase amount of agricultural and sideline products in the province in the third quarter increased by 24.5% compared with last year, it was completed four days ahead of schedule on September 26. The purchase tasks of major agricultural and sideline products such as live pigs, poultry, and tea have also been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

The great development of sideline production in Hunan Province this year is the result of the comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in the people's communes. Because the people's communes can allocate labor on a larger scale and rationally solve the labor contradictions between sideline production and grain production, many seasonal sideline production activities can be grasped in a timely manner, and the number of sideline production projects has increased a lot. For example, Weishan Commune in Ningxiang County operated 217 sideline production projects this year, an increase of 122 projects compared with before the commune. By August of this year, the commune's sideline income increased two and a half times compared with the same period last year, enabling 95.5% of the commune's members to increase their income, and also accumulated more than 180,000 yuan in production funds for the commune.

Hunan Province is an area with a large population and little land, and many sideline occupations. Historically, sideline income has accounted for about half of the total income of farmers. The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee has always attached great importance to sideline production, and has implemented the policy of diversified operations with grain production as the main focus at previous meetings. It requires all localities to carry out regular sideline production activities in accordance with the principle of "vigorously grasping in slack farming seasons and grasping a little in busy farming seasons," adapting to local conditions and making every effort to increase the income of commune members. Party committees at all levels have also designated special personnel to grasp sideline production, establish professional institutions at all levels, and, according to the sideline occupation conditions in their respective regions, carry out project scheduling, unified leadership, comprehensive planning, and divide the sideline business scope of communes, production teams, and commune member households, rationally arrange labor, establish necessary production responsibility systems and reward and punishment systems, and regularly carry out evaluations and inspections.

The various communes have adopted a variety of forms of production activities based on the characteristics of many and scattered sideline production projects. For example, for regular sideline occupations, professional teams are organized to establish a production responsibility system; for seasonal sideline occupations, a combination of professional teams and shock teams is adopted to seize the opportunity and carry out shock operations; small and scattered sideline occupations are planned to be arranged for operation groups and canteens, and auxiliary labor is used to engage in them, or commune members are mobilized to carry out household sideline production during their spare time. In this way, large and small sideline production are all grasped. For example, Baolinchong Brigade of Zhishuipu Commune in Yiyang County arranged small sideline occupations such as making umbrella skeletons, weaving flower baskets, and tying brooms for commune member households to produce during their spare time. By the end of August this year, the average income of each commune member was 17.8 yuan in cash, and a large number of small bamboo goods were supplied to the market. In sideline production, all localities have also combined agricultural production and the current central work according to local conditions, and have achieved multiple benefits. Zhuguang Commune in Anren County organized commune members to go up the mountains to accumulate fertilizer, dig medicinal materials, and collect wild fibers at the same time, earning more than 15,000 yuan in one month. Commune members of Yanjiao Brigade of Yanjiao Commune in Huitong County picked bamboo shoots on the way home from work, picking more than 10,000 catties of bamboo shoots in one month, earning 480 yuan.

### 湖南动员二百五十万人上山下水大搞副业  奋战一冬增加农业产值

　　湖南动员二百五十万人上山下水大搞副业
    奋战一冬增加农业产值
    新华社长沙讯　在今后三个月内，争取全省农村人口平均每人取回副业现金收入十元。这是中共湖南省委在最近召开的一次电话会议上向全省农民提出大抓副业生产的战斗口号。省委要求各地合理安排劳动力，抽出18％的劳动力，即二百五十多万人，投入冬季副业生产。及时组织劳动力上山打猎、采松香、挖药材，下湖捕鱼捞虾，开展短途运输等多种多样的副业生产活动。千方百计地增加社员收入，活跃城乡经济。现在，各地已根据省委指示精神，积极行动起来了。
    今年湖南各公社在大抓粮食生产的同时，副业生产活动从未间断过。在大战8、9月的农事紧张季节里，全省副业收入达七千多万元，约比去年同期增加一半，使全省90％以上的社员都比去年增加了收入，并活跃了城乡经济。因此，今年第三季度全省农副产品计划收购金额虽较去年增加24.5％，但到9月26日就提前四天超额完成了。生猪、家禽、茶叶等主要农副产品的收购任务，也都提前超额完成。
    今年湖南省副业生产大发展，是人民公社农林牧副渔全面大跃进的结果。由于人民公社能在更大范围内调配劳动力，合理解决副业生产与粮食生产间的劳力矛盾问题，使许多季节性强的副业生产都能及时抓起来，副业生产项目增加很多。如宁乡县沩山公社，今年经营的副业生产项目达二百一十七项，比公社化前增加了一百二十二项。这个公社到今年8月份，副业收入比去年同期增加了两倍半，使全社95.5％的社员增加了收入，还为公社积累生产资金十八万多元。
    湖南省是一个人多田少、副业门路多的地区，历来副业收入约占农民总收入的一半。中共湖南省委一直很重视副业生产，历次会议上都贯彻以粮食生产为主的多种经营的方针。要求各地根据“农闲大抓，农忙小抓”的原则，因时因地制宜地开展经常性的副业生产活动，千方百计地增加社员收入。各级党委也都指定专人抓副业生产，层层建立专业机构，并根据本地区的副业门路情况，进行项目排队，统一领导，全面规划，并划分了公社、生产队和社员家庭的副业经营范围，合理的安排劳动力，建立必要的生产责任制和奖惩制度，定期开展评比检查。
    各公社根据副业生产项目多、分散的特点，生产活动采取了多种多样的形式进行。如经常性的副业，组织专业队，建立生产责任制；季节性强的副业，采取专业队与突击队相结合的办法，抓住时机，突击进行；零星分散的小宗副业，就有计划地安排给作业组、食堂，利用辅助劳动力去搞，或发动社员利用工余时间开展家庭副业生产。这样就把大宗小宗副业生产全都抓起来了。如益阳县治水铺公社宝林冲大队将制伞骨、织花篮、扎扫把等小宗副业安排给社员家庭利用工余时间生产，今年到8月底止平均每个社员收入现金十七点八元，还供应市场大批小篾货。各地在副业生产中，还因地制宜地结合农业生产和当前中心工作进行，收到一举数得。安仁县珠泉公社组织社员上山一边积肥，一边挖药材和收集野生纤维，一个月收入一万五千多元。会同县岩脚公社岩脚大队社员在收工时顺道捡笋壳，一个月内捡笋壳一万多斤，收入四百八十元。
