    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: People's communes throughout Anhui Province have unleashed tremendous power, relying on water conservancy projects built in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, to overcome severe drought and achieve a general bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    In the Huaihe River plains, thanks to the enormous role played by the river network projects undertaken by the people's communes in the fight against drought, the 5 million mu of land converted to rice cultivation have yielded good harvests. In the Fuyang area, nearly 3 million mu of converted rice fields have, judging from the harvested yields, produced one to two times more than dryland grain crops, with the emergence of many large-scale, high-yield fields. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 56,000 mu of high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, of which more than 37,000 mu have yields of over 2,000 jin per mu, and 660 mu have yields of over 3,000 jin per mu. The 26,100 mu of rice fields converted by Wangshi Commune in Fuyang County yielded an average of over 1,516 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 100% over last year. The rice fields along the Yangtze River in Wuhu and Anqing areas have also achieved large-scale bumper harvests. In the Huainan and Lu'an areas, although the drought was more severe, the already harvested 2.71 million mu of rice generally yielded significantly more than last year, with more than 188,000 mu yielding over 800 jin per mu, of which more than 120,000 mu yielded over 1,000 jin.

    Sweet potatoes, corn, soybeans, mung beans, and other crops throughout the province have begun to be harvested. The already harvested 90,000 mu of early sweet potatoes in Fuyang County yielded an average of over 4,000 jin per mu, with some yielding up to 10,000 jin. The 2,800 mu of high-yield soybeans in Guangwu Commune, Jieshou County, yielded over 465 jin per mu, with 250 mu yielding 821 jin.

    Good news of large-scale bumper harvests of industrial raw material crops such as cotton and tobacco are also being reported. The 1 million mu of cotton fields in seven counties and cities, including Chaohu, Xiao, Dangshan, Susong, Huaining, Zongyang, and Tongling, have largely completed the harvest of the first crop of cotton bolls, and with the addition of the autumn crop, it is estimated that the average yield of ginned cotton per mu will exceed 100 jin, achieving the highest target for cotton unit yield (average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu) in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    From late June this year, drought appeared in the Huaihe River north and south areas. By early August, the drought had spread throughout the province, with most areas experiencing 70 to 80 days without significant rainfall or with virtually no rain. The drought-affected area in the province reached a maximum of over 54 million mu, accounting for 70% of the province's cultivated land, which was more severe than the most serious drought year on record in Anhui Province in 1934. However, the situation this year is completely different. This year, as soon as the drought emerged, the Party led the broad masses of commune members, relying on the unparalleled power of the people's communes, to carry out large-scale cooperation and wage a resolute struggle against the drought. At the most critical time, more than 9 million people across the province were involved in the drought resistance and seedling protection campaign. Over the course of more than two months, more than 800,000 waterwheels and 3.16 million other water-lifting tools were used. In addition to relying on water conservancy projects built over the past decade to fight drought, large-scale water conservancy projects were also built during the drought to utilize all water sources for irrigation, ultimately providing water to 85% of the drought-affected farmland, ensuring a bumper harvest in a year of severe drought.

    Currently, the drought has not been completely eliminated in some counties, and cadres and the masses are continuing to fight the drought, determined to strive for even greater high yields.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: The autumn harvest situation in Shandong Province is infinitely good, with millions of male and female commune members joyfully harvesting bumper grain crops. By October 13, about 65% of the province's 56 million mu of late autumn grain crops such as soybeans, corn, and sweet potatoes had been harvested. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, good news of bumper late autumn harvests exceeding early autumn harvests in all aspects has been reported daily in the plains, mountains, and hilly areas.

    The more than 20 million mu of soybeans, which have always been considered low-yielding crops in the province, have grown full and plump pods this year. In the Jining area on the shores of Weishan Lake, 3.22 million mu of soybeans have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, with actual yields increasing by 20% to 30% compared to the bumper harvest of last year. Among these, there are 660,000 mu of large-scale high-yield fields with yields of over 300 jin per mu, and 200,000 mu of high-yield fields with yields of 400 to 500 jin per mu. In Yiyuan County in the Yimeng Mountains, where the land is barren and water sources are scarce, soybean yields were originally low; this year, 65,000 mu have reached 235 jin per mu, an increase of 71% over last year.

    The more than 20 million mu of sweet potatoes throughout the province have grown particularly well. In Pingdu County, which has always been considered a low-yielding grain area, mountain and hilly land accounts for two-thirds of the county's land area. This year, there are also 270,000 mu of large-scale high-yield sweet potato fields yielding 6,000 jin per mu, an increase of more than three times compared to last year.

    Corn has also increased in yield. In Laiyang County, which has always had high yields, 390,000 mu of corn have an average yield of 510 jin per mu this year, an increase of 29.4% over last year. In Zhucheng County, 110,000 mu of corn yielded 350 jin per mu, an increase of 34.5% over last year. The Jiayue Production Team of Jiayue Commune in this county has 1,750 mu of corn yielding 890 jin per mu, an increase of more than 100% over last year.

    Units achieving bumper harvests in various crops have also emerged in many places. For example, in the Taiqian People's Commune of Shouzhang County, corn production increased by 60% compared to last year; soybean production increased by 90%, and sweet potato production increased by 80%. This year's bumper harvest of late autumn crops in Shandong was seized from the jaws of the drought demon. The people's communes demonstrated unparalleled superiority in the fight against drought. In July and August, the province generally lacked rain, and people's communes in various places organized a drought resistance army of over 10 million people, persisting in a drought resistance struggle for more than 60 days. Under the slogan of "Fighting the Drought Demon and Cleverly Seizing a Bumper Harvest," the broad masses of commune members throughout the province advanced at a rate of 3 million mu of land irrigated per day. After the communes in Shouzhang County unified the arrangement of labor, they newly dug and repaired more than 11,200 channels in a very short time, irrigating 810,000 mu of land.

    The bumper harvest of late autumn crops has greatly boosted the labor enthusiasm of farmers throughout the province. During the harvest, mass-based competition campaigns to harvest well, thresh well, collect well, sell well, distribute well, and store well have been widely launched in various places. Communes have reasonably arranged labor, organized autumn harvest professional teams, and harvested, transported, and threshed crops as they ripen, achieving fast harvesting, thorough harvesting, and better quality than in any previous year.

　　依靠千万社员的干劲　凭借水利工程的威力
    从旱魔手中夺得粮棉丰收
　　安徽战胜历史上最严重的干旱，水稻、棉花、甘薯样样增产
　　山东坚持六十天抗旱斗争，平原、山区、丘陵地带处处报喜
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省各地人民公社发挥巨大威力，依靠几年来特别是大跃进以来兴修的水利工程，战胜了严重干旱，使秋收作物普遍获得丰收。
    在淮北平原，由于人民公社兴办的河网化工程在抗旱中发挥了巨大作用，改种的五百万亩水稻收成都很好。阜阳专区改种的近三百万亩水稻，从已收打的情况来看，都比旱粮增产一倍到二倍以上，并且出现了不少大面积高额丰产田。据初步统计，经过监收监打亩产千斤以上的丰产田就有五万六千多亩，其中有三万七千多亩亩产两千斤以上，有六百六十亩亩产三千多斤。阜阳县王市公社改种的两万六千一百多亩水稻，平均亩产一千五百一十六斤多，比去年增产将近一倍。沿长江两岸的芜湖、安庆两个专区，水稻都获得了大面积丰收。淮南六安专区，虽然受旱较重，但是已收割的二百七十一万亩水稻，一般仍比去年有很大增产，亩产八百斤以上的就有十八万八千多亩，其中千斤以上的有十二万多亩。
    全省甘薯、玉米、大豆、绿豆等作物，都已开始收获。阜阳县已收的九万亩早甘薯，平均亩产四千多斤，好的亩产达万斤，界首县光武公社二千八百多亩丰产大豆，亩产四百六十五斤多，其中有二百五十亩亩产八百二十一斤。
    棉花、烟叶等工业原料作物大面积丰收的喜讯，也不断传出。全省有巢县、萧县、砀山、宿松、怀宁、枞阳、铜陵等七个县市的一百多万亩棉花，伏桃已大体收获完毕，加上秋桃，预计平均亩产皮棉都可超过一百斤，将提前超额实现全国农业发展纲要的棉花单位产量的最高指标（平均亩产皮棉一百斤）。
    从今年6月下旬开始，淮北、淮南就出现了旱象。到8月初，旱情波及全省，大部分地区七、八十天没有下过透雨或基本无雨。全省受旱面积最高曾达五千四百多万亩，占全省耕地面积70％，这比安徽省历史上有纪录的旱情最严重的一年——1934年的旱情还要严重。但是，今年的情况就完全不同了。今年，旱象刚一露头，党就领导广大社员，依靠人民公社的无比威力，开展大协作，同干旱展开了坚决的斗争。最紧张的时候，全省有九百多万人投入抗旱保苗运动。两个多月中，使用了八十多万辆水车和三百一十六万多件其他提水工具，除凭借十年来兴办的水利工程进行抗旱以外，并在抗旱期间大修水利，利用一切水源灌溉，终于使85％的受旱农田得到了水，保证了大旱之年得丰收。
    目前，一部分县的旱象仍未解除，干部和群众正继续同干旱斗争，决心力争更大高产。
    据新华社济南19日电　山东省秋收形势无限好，数百万男女社员正在喜气洋洋地收割丰产粮。到10月13日，全省五千六百万亩大豆、玉米、甘薯等晚秋粮食作物已经收割了65％左右。从秋收登场以来，不论平原、山区和丘陵地区，天天传来晚秋超早秋，样样大丰收喜报。
    全省一向被称为低产作物的两千多万亩大豆，今年长得荚满粒饱。微山湖滨的济宁专区，有三百二十二万亩大豆获得全面大丰收，实打结果比大丰收的去年还增产两成到三成，其中有六十六万亩大面积丰产田，亩产在三百斤以上，还有二十万亩高额丰产田，亩产四百斤到五百斤。沂蒙山区的沂源县，土地瘠薄，水源缺乏，原来大豆产量较低；今年有六万五千亩亩产达到二百三十五斤，比去年增产71％。
    全省两千多万亩甘薯长得尤为出色。一向称为粮食低产区的平度县，山地丘陵地占全县土地面积三分之二，今年也出现了二十七万亩亩产甘薯六千斤大面积的丰产田，比去年增产三倍多。
    玉米同样增产。一向产量较高的掖县，今年有三十九万亩玉米平均亩产五百一十斤，比去年增产29.4％。诸城县十一万亩玉米亩产三百五十斤，比去年增产34.5％，这个县的贾悦公社贾悦生产队，有一千七百五十亩玉米亩产八百九十斤，比去年增产一倍多。
    各地样样作物大丰收的单位也出现很多。如寿张县台前人民公社，今年玉米比去年增产60％；大豆增产90％，甘薯增产了80％。今年山东的晚秋作物大丰收，是从旱魔手中夺得的。人民公社在抗旱斗争中显示了无比优越性。7、8月间，全省普遍缺雨，各地人民公社组织起一千多万人的抗旱大军，坚持了六十多天的抗旱斗争，在“大战旱魔，巧夺丰收”的口号下，全省广大社员每天以浇地三百万亩的速度向前挺进。寿张县各公社统一安排劳力后，在很短的时间内就新挖和整修渠道一万一千二百多条，浇地达八十一万亩。
    晚秋作物大丰收大大鼓舞了全省农民的劳动热情。在收割中，各地普遍展开群众性的割好、打好、收好、交售好、分配好、保管好的竞赛运动。各公社都把劳力合理安排，组织秋收专业队，边熟、边收、边运、边打，做到了收得快、收得净，质量比任何一年都好。
