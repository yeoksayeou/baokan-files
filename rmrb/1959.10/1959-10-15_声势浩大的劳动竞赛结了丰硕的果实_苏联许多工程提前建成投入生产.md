Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th: Soviet newspapers report that in recent months, good news of the completion of the first batch of projects in the Seven-Year Plan has frequently come from the vast industrial front of the Soviet Union. Many projects were completed and put into production far ahead of schedule.

　　On the iron and steel industry front, four of the five blast furnaces planned to be built this year have been completed. The "Komsomol No. 5" blast furnace of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Plant and a new blast furnace of the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine were completed forty days to three months ahead of schedule, respectively. The New Krivoy Rog Mining and Processing Combine began producing its first batch of iron ore in early August, shortening the construction period from the original forty months to twenty-six months. The New Lipetsk Steel Plant, a key expansion enterprise in the European part of the Soviet Union, has recently completed the world's largest cold rolling workshop, two of the Soviet Union's largest electric arc furnaces, and a coke oven. At the Karaganda Iron and Steel Combine, the Soviet Union's third iron and steel industry base, a power station and several coke ovens have been completed. The entire construction project there has now entered the decisive stage of installation work, and iron production will begin by the end of the year.

　　The achievements of the builders of power stations and chemical industrial enterprises in various places are also very encouraging. The Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the Volga River completed its increased annual construction plan ahead of schedule on September 23, and its eighth hydraulic unit has already begun generating electricity. Among the chemical industrial enterprises and equipment put into production, it is worth mentioning a giant coke oven group at the Yasinovka Coke Chemical Plant in Donbass. Both in terms of production capacity and size, this coke oven group is one of the best in the world.

　　The new victories on the Soviet industrial capital construction front are the result of the Soviet working people, inspired by the grand Seven-Year Plan, bringing into play their energy and launching a vigorous labor competition.

　　As early as the beginning of this year, a large-scale labor competition was launched in hundreds and thousands of Seven-Year Plan construction sites throughout the Soviet Union. Builders strived to accelerate the speed of capital construction in order to complete the Seven-Year Plan and this year's construction tasks ahead of schedule. They clearly realized that this was a major step in winning time in the economic competition with the United States and accelerating the march towards communism. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee held in June this year brought this competition to a new stage. After the June plenary session, the speed of capital construction in various places was further accelerated, and the targets became clearer. In July, Kherson Oblast and Nikolaev Oblast proposed to complete and put into production key construction projects that had already started one, two, or even four years ahead of schedule. Builders of many important projects across the country responded to this initiative. On the construction site of the world-renowned Bratsk Hydropower Station, a heated battle was launched to complete the hydropower station two years ahead of schedule.

　　Due to the vigorous development of the competition, the appearance of construction sites throughout the Soviet Union has been changing rapidly since the beginning of this year, and the pace of construction has been accelerating step by step. At the construction site of the Tomsk Thermal Power Station in Kuzbass, one of the key projects of the Seven-Year Plan, some work teams frequently overfulfilled their work quotas by two or three times. The construction work of another key project, the New Krivoy Rog Mining and Processing Combine, has been carried out around the clock in three shifts since the beginning of this year, without stopping. The capital construction of the power industry is flying even faster. Since the beginning of this year, power station construction workers have greatly overfulfilled the state plan for putting new generating capacity and new power grids into production, which is the first time in recent years. Compared with the same period last year, the number of turbines built and put into production nationwide in the first six months of this year (calculated by generating capacity) has almost doubled, the number of boilers (calculated by power) is almost twice as much, and the total length of newly built high-voltage transmission lines is more than three times that of the same period last year.

　　Now, the unprecedented large-scale construction work planned by the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is continuing day and night. The reinforced concrete skeletons of various tall industrial building complexes, and oil and gas pipelines stretching like giant dragons into the distance, are further and rapidly changing the face of the earth. New enterprises and new equipment are being put into production one after another at a leap forward speed, strengthening the Soviet industry's productive forces.

　　声势浩大的劳动竞赛结了丰硕的果实
    苏联许多工程提前建成投入生产
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　据苏联报纸报道，最近几个月来，苏联辽阔的工业战线上频频传来七年计划头一批工程完工的捷报。许多工程都大大提前建成并投入生产。
    在钢铁工业战线上，今年计划建设的五座高炉中，已有四座完工。第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂的
  “共青团五号”高炉和下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂的一座新高炉，分别比原计划提前四十天到三个月建成。新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业已在8月初开始生产第一批铁矿石，建设期限由原订的四十个月提前到了二十六个月。苏联欧洲地区的重点扩建企业——新利佩茨克钢铁工厂，最近已经建成了世界上最大的冷轧车间，两座苏联最大的电弧炼钢炉和一座炼焦炉。在苏联第三个钢铁工业基地上，卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂已经建成了发电站和炼焦炉多座。目前那里的整个建设工程已进入安装工作的决定性阶段，到年底就要开始出铁。
    各地电力站和化学工业企业建设者的成绩也十分令人鼓舞。伏尔加河上的斯大林格勒水电站已在9月23日提前完成了提高后的全年建设计划，它的第八台水力联动机已经开始发电。在投入生产的化学工业企业和设备中，值得提出的是顿巴斯雅西诺夫焦炭化学工厂的一座巨型炼焦炉组，不论就生产能力或外廓的大小来说，这座炼焦炉组都是世界上首屈一指的。
    苏联工业基本建设战线上的新胜利，是苏联劳动人民在宏伟的七年计划的鼓舞下，发挥干劲、展开轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛的结果。
    还在今年年初，在苏联各地成百成千个七年计划建设工地上，已经声势浩大地展开了劳动竞赛。建筑者们力争加快基本建设速度，以提前完成七年计划和今年的建筑任务。他们清楚地认识到，这是在同美国进行经济竞赛中赢得时间，加速向共产主义进军的重大步骤。苏共中央今年6月举行的全会又使这一竞赛进入了新的阶段。6月全会后，各地基本建设速度进一步加快了，指标更加明确了。刻松州和尼古拉耶夫州在7月间提出，要使已经动工建设的重点工程提前一年、两年甚至四年建成和投入生产。全国许多重要工程的建筑者，纷纷响应了这一倡议。在世界驰名的布拉次克水电站建设工地上，热烈展开了争取提前两年建成水电站的战斗。
    由于竞赛的蓬勃开展，今年以来，苏联各个建设工地的面貌瞬息间都在变化，建设的步伐一步比一步加快，在七年计划的重点工程之一——库兹巴斯的托姆斯克火力发电站建设工地上，有的工作队经常超额两三倍完成工作定额。另一个重点工程——新克里沃罗格选矿联合企业的建筑工作，从今年以来分三班昼夜进行，从不停歇。电力工业的基本建设更是展翅疾飞。今年以来，发电站的建设工人大大超额完成了使新的发电能力和新电力网投入生产的国家计划，这在最近几年中还是头一次。同去年同期比较，今年头六个月中，全国建成并投入生产的涡轮机（按发电能力计算）差不多增加了一倍，锅炉（按功率计算）几乎多二倍，新建的高压输电线的总长度等于去年同期的三倍以上。
    现在，苏联七年计划所规划的空前大规模的建设工作，正在昼夜不停地继续进行着。各种高大的工业建筑群的钢筋水泥骨架，巨龙般伸向远方的输油管和瓦斯管，正在进一步迅速地改变着大地的面貌。新企业和新设备一个接着一个以跃进的速度投入生产，加强着苏联工业的生产力量。
