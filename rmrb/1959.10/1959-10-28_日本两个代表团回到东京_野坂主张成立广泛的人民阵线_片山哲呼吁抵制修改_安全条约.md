Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th -- Two Japanese delegations, the Japanese Communist Party delegation and the Japanese representatives from various circles, who participated in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, returned to Tokyo by the same plane on the afternoon of the 26th.

About three hundred representatives from the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and other mass organizations went to Tokyo's Haneda Airport to welcome the delegations.

Nosaka Sanzō, the head of the Japanese Communist Party delegation, in his speech at the welcoming rally for the delegation's return, emphasized the necessity for Japan to establish a broad people's front in order to ensure the success of the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to restore diplomatic relations with China.

Katayama Tetsu, the head of the Japanese representatives from various circles and former Prime Minister, emphasized the importance of cooperation between the people of Japan and China in maintaining world peace in his speech at the rally. He also said, "It is necessary for the Japanese people to participate in the struggle to resist the government's plan to revise the Security Treaty and sever military ties with the United States."
