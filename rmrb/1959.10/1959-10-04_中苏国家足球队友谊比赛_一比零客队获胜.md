Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: Over 80,000 spectators celebrating the National Day holiday watched with great interest the first international football match held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium today – a friendly match between the national football teams of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet national football team won the match 1-0.

The only goal scored by the visiting team was in the first minute of the match, by left winger and Honored Master of Sports, Ilyin, who is known for his shooting skills. The shot was powerful, and although Chinese goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu made a save attempt, he was unable to keep it out of the goal. Thus, the visiting team’s “lightning” fast attack achieved results in the first minute, eliciting thunderous applause from the entire stadium.

Of the eleven players initially fielded by the Soviet team today, eight were Honored Masters of Sports and three were Masters of Sports. Each player was technically skilled, fast, and aggressive in contesting for the ball. They passed the ball quickly after receiving it, rarely dribbling, resulting in a fast-paced attack that posed a significant threat to the Chinese team. Soviet team captain and Honored Master of Sports Netto, playing in the left midfielder position today, and center forward Ivanov served as offensive organizers, while the agile left winger Ilyin frequently moved around the opponent’s penalty area, looking for opportunities to score, becoming the primary scorer. Right midfielder and Honored Master of Sports Voynov's powerful long-range shots were also very effective.

The Chinese team, conceding a goal at the very beginning, appeared somewhat nervous. Although they intensified their counter-attacks in the first half, their frequent dribbling and passing errors caused many attacks to fail midway. The Chinese team played better in the second half than in the first. The defenders strengthened their defense on the one hand and boldly ran to the midfield line to assist in the attack on the other, giving the forwards more attacking opportunities. The Chinese team's tenacious fighting spirit won waves of loud applause from the audience. However, the experienced Soviet defenders marked their opponents closely, giving the Chinese forward line, consisting of Chen Jialiang, Sun Yuanyun, Nian Weisi, Xian Dixiong, Fang Renqiu, and others, few scoring opportunities. Several "corner kicks" taken by the Chinese team were also caught in the air by the visiting team’s goalkeeper and Honored Master of Sports Ivakin, who is 1.86 meters tall.

After the 90-minute match ended, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Premiers He Long and Li Fuchun, accompanied by the head of the Soviet sports delegation, Romanov, Chairman of the Soviet Union of Sports Societies and Organizations, went to the field to shake hands with each player from both teams and take a group photo. At this moment, enthusiastic applause resounded once again from the audience.

    中苏国家足球队友谊比赛
    一比零客队获胜
    据新华社3日讯　八万多名欢度国庆节假日的首都观众，今天怀着极大兴趣观看了在北京工人体育场举行的第一场国际足球赛——中国、苏联国家足球队之间的精采友谊比赛。比赛结果，苏联国家足球队以一比零获胜。
    客队唯一得分的这一球，是在比赛开始后的第一分钟，由擅长射门的左边锋、功勋运动员伊林射入的。这个球力量很大，中国队守门员张俊秀虽然扑打了一下，仍然没有把它阻止在球门以外。这样，客队的“闪电式”的快速进攻，在第一分钟就获得了成效，博得了全场暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    苏联队今天开头上场的十一名队员中，有八名是功勋运动员，三名是运动健将，个个技术熟练，跑得快，争球积极，他们得到球后就马上传出，很少盘带，因而进攻的速度很快，并且一有机会就射门，给中国队极大威胁。苏联队队长、功勋运动员奈托今天踢左前卫的位置，他和中锋伊万诺夫起着进攻组织者的作用，而灵活的左边锋伊林，则多在对方禁区附近左右穿插，伺机射门，成为主要的得分手。右前卫、功勋运动员沃因诺夫强有力的远射，也很有威力。
    中国队今天一开始就失了一球，显得有些紧张，上半场他们虽然加紧反攻，但因为带球过多和经常传球失误，使多次攻势半途而废。下半场中国队踢得比上半场出色，后卫一方面加强防守，一方面大胆地跑到中线附近助攻，使前锋获得了更多的进攻机会。中国队的顽强奋战精神，博得了观众阵阵的响亮掌声。但苏联队有经验的后卫盯人很紧，使由陈家亮、孙元云、年维泗、冼迪雄、方纫秋等人组成的中国队的锋线很少获得射门机会。中国队发的几次“角球”，也都被客队身高一米八十六的守门员、功勋运动员伊瓦金跳起在空中接住。
    当这场九十分钟的比赛结束以后，董必武副主席，贺龙、李富春副总理由苏联体育代表团团长、苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会主席罗曼诺夫陪同，到球场上同双方队员一一握手，并合影留念。这时，观众中再一次响起了热烈的掌声。
