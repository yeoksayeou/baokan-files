    Xinhua News Agency, Xining – The newly built Xining Steel Plant, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons of steel, produced its first furnace of steel before National Day. The quality of the steel meets standards.

    In addition to the steelmaking workshop, which has already been completed, the steel plant has also installed two small rolling mills in the rolling workshop and has begun trial production of rebar.

    Except for the cranes, the equipment in the newly built steelmaking workshop was all manufactured by Qinghai Province itself.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou – Five new projects at the Banshan Steel Plant in Zhejiang have recently been put into production successively. These five projects are: a 255-cubic-meter blast furnace with an annual production of 120,000 tons of pig iron, a converter with an annual production of 40,000 tons of steel, a small rolling mill with an annual production of 120,000 tons of steel, a 6,000-kilowatt gas power station, and a coking furnace with an annual production of 40,000 tons of coke. From now on, this plant has begun to become a modern medium-sized iron and steel complex with an initial scale.

    Construction of these five projects at the Banshan Steel Plant began in September 1958. During the construction, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, all the plant's employees brought into play their soaring drive and overcame numerous difficulties, finally completing the projects victoriously within a year, and the quality of the projects is excellent. At present, all employees are continuing their efforts to further build the Banshan Steel Plant into a complete, modern, medium-sized integrated factory.

    西宁钢厂流出第一炉钢水
    半山钢铁厂五项工程竣工
    新华社西宁电　新建年产十万吨钢的西宁钢厂，在国庆节前夕流出了第一炉钢水，钢的质量合乎标准。
    这个钢厂除炼钢车间已经建成外，轧钢车间也已安装好两台小型轧钢机，开始进行钢筋的试生产。
    新建的炼钢车间，除了吊车以外，设备都是由青海省自己制造的。
    新华社杭州讯　浙江半山钢铁厂有五项新建工程最近陆续投入生产。这五项工程是：年产生铁十二万吨的二百五十五立方米高炉，年产钢四万吨的转炉，年产钢材十二万吨的小型轧钢车间，六千吨的煤气发电站，年产焦炭四万吨的炼焦炉。从此，这个厂开始成为一个初具规模的现代化中型钢铁联合工厂了。
    半山钢铁厂的这五项工程，是1958年9月开始施工的。建设中，全厂职工在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了冲天干劲，克服了重重困难，终于使工程在一年内胜利建成，而且工程质量良好。目前全体职工正在再接再厉，进一步把半山钢铁厂建设成为一个完整的现代化中型联合工厂。
