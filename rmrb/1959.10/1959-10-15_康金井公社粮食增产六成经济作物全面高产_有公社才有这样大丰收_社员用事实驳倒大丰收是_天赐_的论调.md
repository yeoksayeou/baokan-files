According to a report in the Heilongjiang Daily, how did this year's bumper agricultural harvest come about? The broad masses of commune members of the Kangjinjing People's Commune in Hulan County unanimously believe that it was not because "Heaven opened its eyes," but rather the result of the People's Commune bringing into play its superiority in organizing large-scale production.

    A Comprehensive and Unprecedented Bumper Harvest

This year's summer and autumn crop harvest of the Kangjinjing People's Commune is unprecedented and comprehensive. The 19,800 mu of wheat planted throughout the commune saw an average yield increase of 22.2% compared to 1958; the more than 23,500 mu of flax saw an average yield increase of 72.4% compared to 1958. Currently, the autumn crop harvesting work is in full swing. This year's autumn crops are growing particularly well. Each soybean plant is bearing sixty to seventy pods, with most pods containing three to four beans. The tops of the plants are also plump. Farmers are using the phrases "Sorghum heads compete with oil bottles, corn cobs are as long as clubs" to describe these two crops. The more than 14,900 mu of sugar beets are expected to yield an average of more than 2,330 jin per mu. The Yonggui Management Area, which received a state award in 1958 for its high sugar beet yield, expects its 510 mu of sugar beets to yield more than 3,300 jin per mu this year. Other miscellaneous grains, minor oil crops, and autumn vegetables also achieved rarely seen good harvests. Preliminary surveys, typical yield predictions, and some threshing results prove that this year's grain crops (including soybeans) can reach an average yield of 330 jin per mu, an increase of 78.6% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Although the grain sowing area has been reduced by 7% compared to last year, the total output will increase by 59.7%. Commune members are smiling at the sight of the grain, saying that they have never seen such a good harvest!

    Not a Gift from "Heaven"

Some people say that crops are growing well this year because of "favorable weather." The broad masses of commune members of the Kangjinjing Commune believe this view is wrong. They retorted: There have been similar years in the past, so why didn't the crops grow so well then? Older people here remember that in recent decades, 1932 and 1952 were considered good years of "favorable weather and abundant harvests," but the good crops at that time not only couldn't compare with today, but even the good crops were only in scattered patches. Such a comprehensive bumper harvest like this year has never been seen before. According to the memory of old commune member Li Yunge, in 1932 he worked for a rich peasant nicknamed Zhang the Skinner. His land was top-notch, and in ordinary years it yielded dozens of jin more per mu than others, but that year the nine mu he planted only yielded 150 to 160 jin per mu. Those households who couldn't afford the effort to cultivate the land yielded even less grain. In 1952, due to the mutual aid and cooperation movement led by the Party which improved agricultural productivity, grain yields still couldn't compare with this year. Commune member Shen Yuting said that in 1952, he planted 67 mu of land, and the average yield of grain and beans was only 160 to 170 jin per mu. At the same time, the best land only yielded more than 200 jin per mu. Why are the natural conditions almost the same, and even though this year was hit by more than 30 days of spring drought, the harvest is still so good? The farmers answered this question with their own experience: "It would not have been possible without the People's Commune."

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 brought about a leap in the development of rural productive forces. At that time, the twelve advanced agricultural production cooperatives in Kangjinjing Township, because of their small size and weak strength, could not adapt to the needs of production development. They voluntarily united to form a large cooperative. Nearby townships such as Lijing, Xubao, and Liujia also applied to join this large cooperative. After Chairman Mao proposed that "People's Communes are good," it gave them great encouragement and enabled them to find a clear direction. Therefore, on the basis of the original four townships and thirty-six advanced cooperatives, the current People's Commune was built. Because this form of commune created conditions superior to those of advanced cooperatives for developing production, it fully exerted its enormous power in the first year of its establishment, enabling agricultural production, sideline occupations, industry, animal husbandry, and the cultural and welfare undertakings of commune members to achieve comprehensive development.

    Unified Planning, Planting According to Local Conditions

Because the People's Commune implements the integration of government administration and commune management, it is convenient for unified leadership and planning and arrangement of the entire commune's production. After the Kangjinjing People's Commune was established, the Party committee, while planning the overall production of the commune, also planned the development and improvement of agricultural production. First of all, it broke the limitations of the crop planting area distribution during the period of advanced cooperatives, and implemented planting according to local conditions based on the soil quality and natural resources of each management area. The nine management areas in the west are lower-lying and prone to drought in the spring. When allocating crop planting areas, the commune determined that they should plant more wheat, flax, and rice. The twenty-four management areas in the central part are plains, mainly planting grains and beans. The three management areas located in the hilly areas with poor soil quality, in addition to planting grain crops, also paid attention to developing forestry production. This comprehensive arrangement method has already achieved significant results this year. The Yilan Management Area in the west is very suitable for growing wheat. Last year, due to the limitations of the agricultural cooperative's business scope, it only planted 960 mu. This year, the commune allocated more than 2,100 mu of wheat to them, resulting in a bumper harvest with a yield of more than 190 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to 1958. The plains of each management area in the east are suitable for soybean growth. More soybeans were planted this year, and the yield per mu increased by about 85% compared to the average yield of the entire commune last year. In line with the policy of suburban production serving the city, a professional vegetable production team was established in Kangjinjing Town, which has better soil quality and convenient transportation. The vegetable planting area has more than doubled compared to last year, so vegetable production has greatly increased this year, and the city's needs have been met in a timely manner. The commune also used the favorable conditions of unified leadership and planning of production to adjust the plots of each management area, changing small-area planting to large-area planting. The commune also made full use of the land, eliminating many barren land plots, empty land spaces, and thatch paths. The total land increased by about 2,000 mu throughout the commune as a result. The western part of the commune has tens of thousands of mu of wasteland that had been wanting to be reclaimed for many years but lacked the ability to do so. After the commune was established, it concentrated fifteen tractors and reclaimed 11,400 mu in forty days. The flax and soybeans sown on these wastelands this year have achieved good harvests.

    The "Eight-Character Charter" Bears Fruit

This year's bumper agricultural harvest is also the result of the commune being able to earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. The commune has a large population and great strength, and organizes large-scale production in deep plowing, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation, greatly improving work efficiency. Last year, as soon as the People's Commune was established, it encountered three major tasks: iron smelting, autumn harvesting, and plowing, and the time for each task was very tight. However, the People's Commune organized professional teams to smelt iron and mobilized women to participate in the autumn harvest, thereby ensuring that the entire commune could organize more than 10,000 people to carry out a surprise attack on plowing the land, enabling 71% of the land to be plowed in the autumn, which is equivalent to three times the area of land plowed in the autumn in the past. The commune uniformly organized water conservancy teams and has now drilled forty wells. The first phase of the reservoir project was completed this spring and has already irrigated more than 2,500 mu of rice fields, which have now achieved good harvests. The fertilizer accumulation campaign last winter and this spring enabled 300,000 mu of land to be fertilized once (about 4,000 jin per mu), eliminating bare land. The entire commune organized seed exchange, enabling the entire commune to realize improved varieties. In terms of cultivation, it implemented reduced ridges and increased rows, achieving reasonable close planting, and the number of plants increased by 20% compared to previous years. Great achievements have also been made in tool reform and pest and disease control.

    Women Have Made Great Contributions

The great development of various undertakings of the commune has reduced the number of male laborers engaged in agriculture by about 20% compared to the past. The implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" has greatly increased the workload of agricultural production compared to the past. Why are agricultural production and other production tasks still being completed so well? This is because after the establishment of the People's Commune, the political and ideological work has been done well, the policy of "distribution according to labor" has been implemented, and the awareness and labor enthusiasm of the commune members have been greatly improved compared to the past. After communization, 70% of the commune members achieved full attendance every month, and labor efficiency generally increased by about 30%. Welfare facilities such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and sewing groups established after communization have played a great role. Many women who were previously burdened by housework also have the opportunity to participate in production. Now 90% of the women with labor ability have participated in production. This is a force that cannot be ignored, and they have made great contributions to this year's bumper harvest.

    All Walks of Life Support Agriculture

The bumper agricultural harvest is also because the commune is an organization that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the support of agriculture from all walks of life has also played a major role. Before communization, there were only eight handicraft workshops here, which were far from being able to meet the needs of agricultural production development. Thirteen factories have been established after communization, and these factories have played a major role in serving agricultural production. In the past, repairing new-style agricultural tools had to go to the county seat sixty miles away, but now they can be repaired at the commune's farm tool factory. In the past, clumsy stone mills were used to grind rice and roll flour, wasting a lot of human and animal power. Now, the vast majority of grain in each management area is processed by rice mills, saving tens of thousands of man-days of labor. Commercial work has also actively supported agricultural production. This spring, the vegetable sowing area increased sharply, and there was a shortage of vegetable seeds. The commercial departments went out to purchase them, and finally guaranteed the needs. Middle and primary school students have also played a significant role in the work of rushing to plow land and controlling pests and diseases.

　　康金井公社粮食增产六成经济作物全面高产
    有公社才有这样大丰收
    社员用事实驳倒大丰收是“天赐”的论调
    据黑龙江日报报道　今年的农业大丰收怎样来的？呼兰县康金井人民公社广大社员一致认为不是什么“老天爷睁了眼”，而是人民公社发挥了它组织大生产的优越性的结果。
    全面的空前大丰收
    今年康金井人民公社夏、秋作物的大丰收是空前的、全面的。全社种植的一万九千八百亩小麦，平均每亩产量比1958年提高22.2％；两万三千五百多亩亚麻，平均每亩产量比1958年提高72.4％；现在，大秋作物的收获工作进行得轰轰烈烈。今年的大秋作物长得也特别好，大豆每棵结荚六、七十个，大部分荚都有三、四个粒，顶梢上也都长得鼓溜溜的；农民用“高粱穗大赛油瓶，苞米棒长赛棒槌”来形容这两种庄稼；一万四千九百多亩甜菜预计亩产达到两千三百三十多斤。1958年因为甜菜高产获得国家奖励的永贵管理区，今年的五百一十亩甜菜预计每亩产量可达三千三百多斤。其它杂粮、小油料以及秋菜，也都是历史上少有的好收成。据普查、典型地预测和打了一部分场的结果证明，今年的粮食作物（包括大豆）平均亩产可达三百三十斤，比大跃进的1958年增长78.6％，谷物播种面积虽然比去年减少7％，总产量还将提高59.7％。社员们眼瞅着粮食心里笑，都说这是从来没有过的好收成！
    不是“老天爷”的恩赐
    有人说今年庄稼长得好是因为“风调雨顺”，康金井公社广大社员认为这种看法是错误的。他们反问道：像这样的年头早先也有过，庄稼怎么没长这么好呢？这里的老年人还记得，近几十年来，1932年和1952年算是“风调雨顺，五谷丰登”的好年头了，可是那时候好庄稼不仅赶不上现在，就是有好庄稼也是一疙瘩一块的，像今年这样全面大丰收，还从未见过。根据老社员李云阁回忆，1932年他给一个外号叫做张扒皮的富农扛活，那是头等地，平常年景一亩地也比别人多打几十斤，可是那年他种的九亩地每亩也只打一百五、六十斤；那些花不起工夫侍弄不上地的户，打的粮食更少了。1952年由于党领导的互助合作运动提高了农村的生产力，可是粮食产量也还是比不上今年。社员沈玉廷说，他在1952年种六十七亩地，每亩粮豆平均产量只有一百六、七十斤，同时最好的土地亩产也只有二百多斤。为什么自然条件相差无几，甚至今年还遭到了三十多天的春旱，收成还这样好呢？农民用切身体验回答了这个问题。那就是“没有人民公社是办不到的。”
    1958年的大跃进，使农村生产力得到了飞跃的发展。当时康金井乡的十二个高级农业生产合作社，因为社小力薄不能适应生产发展的需要了，他们曾自动地联合起来组成了大社。附近的历井、许堡、刘家等乡也申请加入了这个大社。毛主席提出“人民公社好”以后，给了他们以极大的鼓舞，使他们找到了明确的方向，于是就在原来四个乡、三十六个高级社的基础上建成了现在的人民公社。由于公社这种形式为发展生产创造了优于高级社的条件，所以成立后的第一年就充分发挥了它的巨大力量，使农业生产和副业、工业、畜牧业以及社员文化生活福利事业获得了全面的大发展。
    统一规划因地种植
    由于人民公社实行政社合一，这就便于统一领导和规划、安排全公社的生产。康金井人民公社建成之后，党委在规划公社的全面生产同时，对农业生产的发展与提高也进行了规划。首先是打破了高级社时期作物种植面积分布的局限性，根据各管理区的土质、自然资源等条件实行因地种植。西部九个管理区地势较洼，春季亢旱，公社在分配作物种植面积时确定他们多种小麦、亚麻和水稻；中部二十四个管理区是平川地，以种植粮、豆为主；三个位于丘陵地带、土质较差的管理区，除了种植粮食作物以外，还注意发展林业生产。这种全面安排的方法今年已经获得了显著的效果。西部的依兰管理区种小麦很合适，去年由于农业社的经营范围的限制，只种九百六十亩，今年公社分配给他们种两千一百多亩小麦，结果获得了大丰收，亩产达到一百九十多斤，比1958年提高30％多。东部各个管理区的平川地适合大豆生长，今年多种了大豆，结果亩产比去年全社平均产量提高85％左右。本着郊区生产为城市服务的方针，在土质较好、交通方便的康金井镇建立了专业的蔬菜生产队，蔬菜种植面积比去年扩大了一倍多，因此今年蔬菜产量大大增加，及时地供应了城市的需要。公社还利用统一领导和规划生产这个有利条件，调整了各管理区的地块，改小面积种植为大面积种植。公社还充分地利用了土地，消灭了不少荒地格、空地头、茅道，全社因此增加的土地就约有两千亩。公社西部有几万亩荒地，多少年来想开垦而无力实现，公社建成后集中十五部拖拉机，在四十天内就开荒一万一千四百亩，今年在这些荒地上播种的亚麻和大豆获得了很好的收成。
    “八字宪法”开花结果
    今年的农业大丰收也是由于公社有可能认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的结果。公社人多力量大，在深耕土地、兴修水利、积肥等方面组织大生产，使工效大大提高。去年人民公社刚一成立，就遇到了炼铁、秋收和翻地三大任务，而且各项工作的时间都很紧迫。可是人民公社组织了专业队伍炼铁，发动妇女参加秋收，从而保证了全公社能够组织一万多人突击翻耕土地，使71％的土地得到了秋翻，等于过去秋翻地的三倍；公社统一组织了水利队伍，现已打机井四十眼，水库第一期工程在今年春天完工，已经浇灌两千五百多亩稻田，现在已经获得了很好的收成；去冬今春的积肥运动，使三十万亩土地都施了一次肥（亩施四千斤左右），消灭了白茬地；全社组织种子串换，使全社实现了良种化；在耕作方面，实行缩垅增行，作到了合理密植，庄稼的株数比往年增加20％；工具改革、防治病虫害等方面也作出了很大的成绩。
    妇女立下了巨大功劳
    公社各项事业的大发展，使从事农业的男劳动力比过去减少了20％左右，“八字宪法”的贯彻又使农业生产工作量比过去大大增加，为什么农业生产和其它各项生产任务还完成得这样好呢？这是因为在成立人民公社之后由于政治思想工作做得好，“按劳分配”政策的贯彻执行，以及社员们的觉悟和劳动积极性比过去大大提高了。公社化后，70％的社员达到月月满勤，劳动效率一般提高30％左右。公社化后办起来的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫组等福利设施起了很大作用，许多过去为家务事所累的妇女，也有机会参加生产了。现在90％有劳动能力的妇女都参加了生产，这是一支不可忽视的力量，她们为今年大丰产立下了大功劳。
    各行各业支援农业
    农业生产的大丰收，还因为公社是工农商学兵相结合的组织，各行业对农业的支援也起了重大作用。公社化前这里只有八家手工业作坊，远远不能满足农业生产发展的需要。公社化后建立了十三个工厂，这些工厂在为农业生产服务方面起了重大作用。过去修理新式农具必须到六十里远的县城去，现在在本社农具厂就可以修理；过去使用笨碾子磨推米轧面，浪费很多人力畜力，现在各管理区绝大部分粮食由制米厂加工，仅这一项就节省了数以万计的人马工。商业工作也积极支援农业生产，今年春天蔬菜播种面积骤增，菜籽感到不足，商业部门就四出采购，终于保证了需要。中、小学生们在突击翻地、防治病虫害的工作中也起了不小的作用。
