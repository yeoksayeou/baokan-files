Heroes' Meeting Inside and Out

    Two Skilled Workers Happily Meet; A Letter Travels a Thousand Miles
    The two girls excitedly hugged and jumped as soon as they met, their four little braids swinging around on their backs. This was the enthusiastic scene when Zhang Jinsheng, a vote-counting expert from Shanxi Province, paid a visit to Zhang Yuling, a vote-counting expert from Heilongjiang Province.
    Zhang Jinsheng is a cashier at the South City District Office of the People's Bank of China in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. She came to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Heroes. As soon as the car stopped at the Xiyuan Hotel, she noticed that the Heilongjiang delegation was also staying there. She thought, "Zhang Yuling must be here too." She had long remembered this fellow expert.
    After lunch, Zhang Jinsheng went to visit Zhang Yuling. After exchanging warm greetings, Jinsheng asked, "How much can you count now?" Yuling said, "I can count 16,000 fan-shaped stacks per hour and 14,000 single sheets per hour. How about you?" Jinsheng said, "I can count 31,400 fan-shaped stacks per hour, but only 13,800 single sheets per hour. I still have to learn from you!"
    As the lamps were lit, Zhang Jinsheng returned to her dormitory, took out the fake banknotes she had brought from Taiyuan, and sat down to count them rapidly. Someone said, "Your multi-finger counting is already the best, why are you still practicing?"
    "No, I'm still 200 sheets short on single-sheet counting! I have to catch up during the conference, or the gap will widen even further!" Jinsheng replied.
    The next day, Jinsheng sat at her desk and wrote a letter to her partners in her group. The letter said, "...I saw Comrade Zhang Yuling, a cashier from the Mudanjiang City People's Bank of China in Heilongjiang Province, here. Now her efficiency in counting single sheets has reached 14,000 sheets. This is the advanced level. You have to work harder and strive to catch up during the Congress of Heroes!"

### 两位能手喜相逢　一封家书传千里

    两位能手喜相逢　一封家书传千里
    两个姑娘一见面就兴奋地拥抱着跳起来了，四条小辫子在背上甩得滴溜溜转。这是山西省点票能手张晋生，登门拜访黑龙江省点票能手张玉苓的一个热烈场面。
    张晋生是山西省太原市人民银行南城区办事处的出纳员。这次来北京出席全国群英会，汽车刚在西苑大旅社停下，她就发现黑龙江省代表团也住在这里。她想：“张玉苓一定也来了”。她早把这位同行能手记得老熟了。
    吃过中饭，张晋生便跑去拜访张玉苓。互相亲切问候之后，晋生开口问道：“你现在能点多少啦？”玉苓说：“扇面点每小时一万六千张；点单张每小时一万四千张。你呢？”晋生说：扇面点，每小时三万一千四百张，点单张每小时才一万三千八百张。我还得跟你学习哩！”
    掌灯时分，张晋生回到宿舍，拿出她从太原带来的假钞票，坐下来就嗖嗖地点了起来。有人说：“多指点票效你算最高了，还练什么呀？”
    “不，点单张我还差二百哩！我得争取在大会期间赶上去，要不，就会拉的更远了！”晋生回答说。
    第二天，晋生伏在桌上给她组里的伙伴们写信了。信上说：“……我在这里看到了黑龙江省牡丹江市人民银行出纳员张玉苓同志，现在她点单张的效率已达到一万四千张。这才算先进水平，你们得下点苦功，争取在群英会开会期间赶上去啊！”
