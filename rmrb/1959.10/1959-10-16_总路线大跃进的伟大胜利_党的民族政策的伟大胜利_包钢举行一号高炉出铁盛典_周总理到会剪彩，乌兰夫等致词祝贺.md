　　Fomin, head of the Soviet delegation and counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, who came to celebrate the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the tapping of iron from Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace, also attended today's conference.

　　Also attending today's conference were: Kui Bi, Secretary of the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee; Wang Yilun and Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region; Major General Liu Huaxiang, Deputy Commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region; as well as heads of various departments and commissions of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and various departments and bureaus of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and Su Qianyi, Secretary of the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee and First Secretary of the CPC Baotou Municipal Committee, and other Baotou municipal party and government leaders, Baotou Steel leaders, and Soviet experts led by Styebanski who are helping with the construction of Baotou Steel.

　　More than 5,000 Baotou Steel workers participated in today's celebration.

　　Today, Baotou Steel was a scene of festive celebration, with countless red flags fluttering in the wind on the Baotou Steel construction site. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao was hung on the rostrum facing the No. 1 Blast Furnace. The two large slogans on both sides of the rostrum were: "The tapping of iron from Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a great victory of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward!" "The tapping of iron from Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a great victory of the Party's ethnic policy!" From 12:00 noon, the venue was filled with worker representatives and guests who came to participate in the conference. At about 2:00 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai and others, accompanied by Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and First Secretary of the CPC Baotou Municipal Committee, ascended the rostrum. The Baotou Steel workers participating in the conference warmly welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai to preside over the iron-tapping ribbon-cutting ceremony with thunderous applause, grateful for the infinite care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the construction of Baotou Steel.

　　After Li Chao, Deputy General Manager of Baotou Steel, delivered the opening speech, Chairman Ulanhu spoke first. Ulanhu said: Today, with extremely excited hearts, we are holding a grand ceremony here to celebrate the completion and commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace, which makes us extremely happy that Premier Zhou has personally participated in the celebration conference despite his busy schedule, bringing the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which has given us great encouragement and infinite strength. Participating in this conference are also responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Committee; responsible comrades from various fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions; and comrades from the Soviet delegation, Soviet experts, and experts from other fraternal countries. The arrival of these comrades has greatly increased our confidence and courage to continue the Great Leap Forward. On behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the People's Committee, and the people of all ethnic groups in the region, I would like to express my warm welcome. Ulanhu said that the completion and commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule is a victory of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, a victory of the Party's ethnic policy, and the result of the hard work of the builders of Baotou Steel and the Baotou industrial base. This vivid fact once again fully demonstrates the greatness, wisdom, and correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership. The reason why Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace was able to be completed and put into production ahead of schedule is also inseparable from the strong support of various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and hundreds of factories and mining enterprises across the country, and is inseparable from the selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts. Here, on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, the People's Committee, and the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks.

　　Ulanhu continued: Baotou Steel is one of the three major iron and steel joint enterprises currently under construction in China, and Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is one of the largest automated large blast furnaces in China. The high-speed construction of such a large-scale modern iron and steel joint enterprise in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which originally had a very weak industrial foundation, and the commissioning of the No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule, was something that people could not have dreamed of in the thousands of years of old China. However, in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups, the development of the Baotou industrial base centered on Baotou Steel has been victoriously realized. This huge achievement is playing and will play an increasingly important role in the greater leap forward in national socialist construction, especially in fundamentally changing the historical face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, this is a great joyous event worthy of warm celebration by the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　Ulanhu said: The completion and commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is only the beginning of our great victory in striving to build this complete iron and steel joint enterprise. The tasks of production and construction in the future are even more complex and arduous. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost our spirits, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in a sustained and in-depth manner, in order to fulfill the production plan for this year ahead of schedule and surpass it, and to bravely advance to meet the tasks of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward next year.

　　Xia Yun, Vice Minister of Metallurgical Industry, on behalf of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, paid tribute to the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee and the Baotou Municipal Committee that led the construction of Baotou Steel, to all regions and units across the country that supported the construction of Baotou Steel, to all Baotou Steel workers, and to the Soviet expert group led by Styebanski, welcomed the Soviet delegation headed by Fomin who attended today's conference, and through them expressed gratitude to the Soviet government and people. He said: Baotou Steel, like Anshan Steel and Wuhan Steel, is one of the three largest iron and steel bases in China. It occupies an important position in China's complete and powerful industrial system that is about to be formed, and will become an important backbone force in China's iron and steel industry. Every day that the construction of Baotou Steel is advanced, the country can obtain thousands of tons of steel, which is of great significance to the high-speed development of the entire iron and steel industry.

　　Xia Yun said that there had been disputes over the question of whether Baotou Steel could be built at high speed. Some people exaggerated the difficulties of objective material and technical conditions in the construction process, failed to see the infinite power hidden in the masses, and therefore lacked confidence in building Baotou Steel at high speed, adopting a passive attitude and harboring serious right-leaning thoughts. As recently as two or three months ago, some people were still skeptical about whether the No. 1 Blast Furnace could tap iron ahead of the National Day. Now, the fact that Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is tapping iron ahead of schedule vividly and powerfully refutes these right-leaning ideas. It fully demonstrates that it is entirely possible to build large-scale iron and steel bases at high speed in our country. We must advance bravely along this path of high-speed development of the iron and steel industry that has been repeatedly proven by practice, relying on the broad masses of people under the leadership of the Party, with a spirit of continuous revolution. Xia Yun concluded by saying: Now, the situation on the iron and steel front is very good. All the workers in the iron and steel industry are fighting heroically to complete the great task of 12 million tons of steel this year ahead of schedule and surpass it. We believe that all the workers of Baotou Steel will be able to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, continue to boost their spirits, vigorously increase production and practice economy, and stand at the forefront of the national iron and steel front.

　　Fomin, head of the Soviet delegation and counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, who participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the tapping of iron from Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace, also spoke at the conference. He said: We Soviet people are happy for our Chinese friends in building this great work. In a very short period of time, an iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output equal to more than three times the highest annual output of China before 1949 will be built on this grassland. From the construction of the blast furnace to the production of the first furnace of molten iron, new records of rapid construction were created without exception on every construction site. Only the blind and those who have lost their minds cannot see the victorious and magnificent steps of the Chinese people. He said that just as no one can stop the third cosmic rocket created by the wisdom of the Soviet people from flying in space, no one can stop the great Chinese people from leaping forward towards a bright future and towards socialism. At the end of his speech, Fomin presented a flag to all the workers of Baotou Steel on behalf of all the workers of the Leningrad Black Metallurgical Design Institute; he also brought a congratulatory letter from the Leningrad Black Metallurgical Design Institute's Communist Youth League organization to the Baotou Steel Communist Youth League organization.

　　Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, congratulated and said: The completion of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule is a great victory for our Party's general line for building socialism and the Great Leap Forward, and also a great victory for our Party's ethnic policy. After the national liberation, our Party has used great efforts to help develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the minority ethnic regions, so that they can reach the level of advanced ethnic groups in a shorter historical period. The establishment of Baotou Steel is a concrete embodiment of the implementation of our Party's ethnic policy. We are very happy to see that, with the establishment of Baotou Steel, the industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry production, and cultural and educational undertakings of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have undergone significant changes, and a contingent of workers of all ethnic groups with socialist consciousness and mastering modern production technology is rapidly growing. After Baotou Steel is fully completed and put into production, it will greatly promote the leap-forward development of various construction undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Baotou Steel is the first large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise built in the minority ethnic regions of our country, which not only inspires the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also greatly inspires the people of all minority ethnic groups in the country to unite closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to strive to build our great socialist country at an early date.

　　Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that the commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule eloquently demonstrates that the Chinese working class, under the wise leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, has the heroic spirit of making high mountains bow and rivers give way, and no difficulties can stop us from moving forward. He also said that the construction speed of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is fast, the quality is good, and the investment is saved. This is the result of all the workers of Baotou Steel, under the leadership of the Party, going all out, aiming high, and achieving a Great Leap Forward, and is the result of putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements on a large scale, which will play a major role in completing the great task of 12 million tons of steel this year ahead of schedule and surpassing it.

　　Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, congratulated the more than 7,000 female workers and family members of Baotou Steel, and all the workers of Baotou Steel, for making daily leap forwards, monthly leap forwards, and annual Great Leap Forwards.

　　Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: Now we not only have Anshan Steel, but also Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel; we not only have large-scale modern iron and steel joint enterprises with an annual output of several million tons of steel, but also hundreds of medium and small-sized iron and steel bases. Countless facts have proved that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the people and youth of our country have great ambitions and infinite confidence. He encouraged the Communist Youth League organization of Baotou Steel to follow the leadership of the Party, adhere to the policy of carrying out mass movements on a large scale, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost their spirits, boldly mobilize the masses, launch a competition movement to enter 1960 at high speed, and, together with all the workers, seize one victory after another in socialist construction.

　　Wang Jinzhang, Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Li Weimin, Mayor of Anshan, also spoke at the conference, congratulating the great achievements of Baotou Steel's construction.

　　At 4:00 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Ulanhu, came to the side of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace and cut the ribbon amid music. Soon, a fiery red stream of molten iron flowed out like a giant dragon, and thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue.

　　After the ribbon-cutting, Premier Zhou Enlai and the guests watched the first furnace of molten iron flowing out and continuously congratulated the workers of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups in the iron-smelting workshop. (Attached picture)

　　总路线大跃进的伟大胜利　党的民族政策的伟大胜利
    包钢举行一号高炉出铁盛典
    周总理到会剪彩，乌兰夫等致词祝贺
    新华社包头15日电　包钢第一号高炉出铁剪彩典礼大会，今天下午二时在一号高炉前面广场上隆重举行。
    中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，参加了今天的大会并亲自剪彩。
    参加今天包钢一号高炉出铁剪彩典礼大会的，还有国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅，国务院副总理、内蒙古自治区主席乌兰夫，人大常委会副委员长、中共中央统战部部长李维汉，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，和中共中央、国务院各部、委以及群众团体的负责人：程子华、刘长胜、徐冰、张执一、胡克实、康克清、刘春、萨空了、吕东、夏耘、卓雄、程明升、江明、刘裕民。
    参加今天大会的还有：北京市副市长万里，宁夏回族自治区副主席王锦章，鞍山市市长李维民，太原市副市长任善征，以及支援包钢建设的全国各地兄弟厂矿的代表。
    前来庆祝包钢一号高炉出铁剪彩典礼大会的苏联代表团团长、苏联驻华大使馆参赞符明，也出席了今天的大会。
    出席今天大会的还有：中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记奎璧，自治区副主席王逸伦、孙兰峰，内蒙古军区副司令员刘华香少将，以及内蒙古党委各部委、内蒙古自治区各厅局负责人，和中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记、中共包头市委第一书记苏谦益等包头市党政负责人，包钢负责人，及以斯捷班斯基为首的帮助包钢建设的苏联专家们。
    参加今天庆祝大会的包钢职工共五千多人。
    今天，包钢一片节日景象，无数面红旗在包钢工地上迎风招展。面向一号高炉的大会主席台上，悬挂着毛主席的巨幅画像。主席台两旁的两幅大标语是：“包钢一号高炉出铁是总路线、大跃进的伟大胜利！”“包钢一号高炉出铁是党的民族政策的伟大胜利！”大会会场上，从中午十二时起就站满了前来参加大会的职工代表和来宾。下午二时许，周恩来总理等在内蒙古党委书记、中共包头市委员会第一书记苏谦益陪同下，登上主席台。参加大会的包钢职工，以雷动的掌声衷心地欢迎周恩来总理前来主持出铁剪彩仪式，感激党中央和毛主席对包钢建设的无限关怀。
    大会由包钢副总经理李超致开幕词后，乌兰夫主席首先讲话。乌兰夫说：今天，我们怀着极其兴奋的心情，在这里举行庆祝包钢一号高炉建成投入生产剪彩典礼大会，使我们万分高兴的是，周总理在百忙中亲自参加庆祝大会，带来了党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀，给了我们莫大的鼓舞和无限的力量。参加这个大会的，还有中央各部门的负责同志们；还有来自各兄弟省、市、自治区的负责同志们；还有苏联代表团、苏联和其他兄弟国家的专家同志们。这些同志的到来，大大增加了我们继续大跃进的信心和勇气。我谨代表内蒙古自治区党委和人民委员会以及全区各族人民，表示热烈的欢迎。乌兰夫说，包钢一号高炉提前一年建成投入生产，是党中央和毛主席英明领导的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是我国社会主义建设大跃进的胜利，是党的民族政策的胜利，是包钢和包头工业基地的建设者辛勤劳动的结果。这一生动事实又一次充分说明了党和毛主席领导的伟大、英明和正确。包钢一号高炉所以能够提前建成投入生产，也是同全国各省市自治区和全国几百个厂矿企业的大力支援分不开的，是同我们伟大盟邦苏联的无私援助和苏联专家的热情帮助分不开的。这里，我谨代表内蒙古自治区党委和人民委员会以及全自治区各族人民，致以衷心的感谢。
    乌兰夫接着说：包钢是我国目前建设的三大钢铁联合企业之一，包钢一号高炉又是我国目前最大的自动化大型高炉之一。像这样大型的现代化的钢铁联合企业，能够在原来工业基础极其薄弱的内蒙古自治区高速度地建设起来，使一号高炉提前一年建成投入生产，这是旧中国几千年历史上人们所梦想不到的，然而在中国共产党和我国各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下的新中国，胜利实现了以包钢为中心的包头工业基地建设的大发展。这一巨大成就，对全国社会主义建设的更大跃进，特别是对彻底改变内蒙古自治区的历史面貌，正在发挥和将要发挥它越来越大的作用。因而，这是值得全国和内蒙古自治区各族人民热烈庆祝的一件大喜事。
    乌兰夫说：包钢一号高炉的建成投入生产，只是我们争取建设这个完整的钢铁联合企业的重大胜利的开始。今后生产和建设的任务，是更加复杂和艰巨的。我们一定要坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，更高地举起党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，反右倾，鼓干劲，持久地深入地开展增产节约运动，为提前和超额完成今年的生产计划，迎接明年更大更好更全面的跃进任务，奋勇前进。
    冶金工业部副部长夏耘，代表冶金工业部向领导建设包钢的中共内蒙古自治区党委和包头市委、支援包钢建设的全国各地区各单位、包钢全体职工，以及以斯捷班斯基为首的苏联专家组致敬，向今天到会的以符明为首的苏联代表团表示欢迎，并通过他们向苏联政府和人民致以谢意。他说：包钢和鞍钢、武钢一样，是我国最大的三个钢铁基地之一，在将要形成的我国完整的、强大的工业体系中，它占有重要的位置，并将成为我国钢铁工业的一支重要的骨干力量。包钢的建设每提前一天，国家就可以得到数以千吨计的钢铁，对于整个钢铁工业的高速度发展，有着极为重大的意义。
    夏耘说，在能不能高速度建设包钢的问题上，是曾经有过争论的。有的人过分夸大了建设过程中客观物质技术条件的困难，看不到蕴藏在群众中的无穷无尽的力量，因此对高速度建设包钢信心不足，抱着消极的态度，存在着严重的右倾思想。就在二、三个月以前，也还有人对第一号高炉能否在国庆节前夕提前出铁，抱着怀疑的态度。现在，包钢一号高炉提前出铁的事实，生动而有力地驳倒了这些右倾思想。它充分说明了在我国高速度地建设大型钢铁基地是完全可能的。我们必须沿着这条为实践所一再证明的高速度发展钢铁工业的道路，在党的领导下，依靠广大群众，以不断革命的精神奋勇前进。夏耘最后说：现在，钢铁战线上的形势十分良好。钢铁工业的全体职工，正在为提前超额完成一千二百万吨钢的任务英勇奋斗。我们相信包钢的全体职工，一定能够在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议，彻底反右倾，继续鼓干劲，厉行增产节约，站在全国钢铁战线的最前线。
    参加包钢一号高炉出铁剪彩典礼大会的苏联代表团团长、苏联驻华大使馆参赞符明，也在大会上讲了话。他说：我们苏维埃人为了我们中国朋友在建设这一巨大工作而感到高兴，在极短的期间内，在这个草原上将要建成一个年产量等于1949年以前中国最高年产量三倍多的钢铁联合企业。从建设高炉起到出第一炉铁水，在每个建筑工地上都无例外地创造了快速施工的新纪录。只有瞎子和失去理智的人，才看不见中国人民胜利的和雄壮的步伐。他说，就像不能阻止苏联人民用智慧所创造的第三个宇宙火箭在太空飞行一样，任何人也同样不能阻止向着美好的未来、向着社会主义迈进的伟大的中国人民的飞跃前进。符明在结束讲话时，代表苏联列宁格勒黑色冶金设计院的全体职工向包钢全体职工献旗；他还带来了列宁格勒黑色冶金设计院共青团组织给包钢共青团组织的贺信。
    政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉祝贺说：包钢一号高炉的提前一年建成，这是我们党的建设社会主义总路线和大跃进的伟大胜利，也是我们党的民族政策的伟大胜利。全国解放后，我们的党就以很大的力量来帮助发展各少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化事业，以便使他们能够在较短的历史时期内达到先进民族的水平。包钢的建立就是具体地体现了我们党的民族政策的贯彻执行。我们很高兴地看到，随着包钢的建立，内蒙古自治区的工、农、牧业生产和文化教育事业已经有了显著的变化，一支有着社会主义觉悟的、掌握着近代生产技术的各族工人队伍正在迅速地成长起来。包钢全部建成和投入生产后，它将更大地促进内蒙古自治区各项建设事业的飞跃发展。包钢是在我国少数民族地区建立的第一个大型钢铁联合企业，这不仅鼓舞着内蒙古自治区各族人民，也大大地鼓舞着全国各少数民族人民紧密团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，为早日建成我们伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在讲话中说，包钢一号高炉提前一年出铁，雄辩地说明在伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党英明领导下的中国工人阶级，具有让高山低头、河水让路的英雄气概，任何困难也阻挡不了我们前进。他还说，包钢一号高炉建设速度快，质量好，投资省，是由于包钢全体职工在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，实现大跃进的结果，是政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的结果，对于提前和超额完成今年一千二百万吨钢的伟大任务将起重大作用。
    全国妇女联合会副主席康克清在讲话中祝包钢的七千多名女职工和职工家属，和包钢全体职工一道日日跃进，月月跃进，年年大跃进。
    共青团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实说：现在我们不但有了鞍钢，而且有了武钢，有了包钢；我们不但有了年产几百万吨钢的大型现代化钢铁联合企业，而且有了千百个中小型的钢铁基地。无数的事实证明，在党和毛主席的领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国人民和青年有伟大的志气和无限的信心。他勉励包钢的共青团组织，一定要遵循党的领导，坚持大搞群众运动的方针，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，放手发动群众，开展高速度跨进1960年的竞赛运动，和全体职工一道，在社会主义建设中夺取一个又一个的胜利。
    宁夏回族自治区副主席王锦章、鞍山市市长李维民，也在大会上讲了话，祝贺包钢建设的巨大成就。
    下午四时，周恩来总理在乌兰夫主席的陪同下，来到包钢一号高炉旁边，在乐声中剪了彩。不久，像巨龙似的火红的铁水流了出来，霎时全场响起了雷动的掌声。
    剪彩后，周恩来总理和来宾们一道观看了流出来的一炉铁水，不断向炼铁车间的蒙汉等族职工祝贺。（附图片）
