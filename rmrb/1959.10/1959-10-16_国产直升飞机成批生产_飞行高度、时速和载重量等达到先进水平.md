Xinhua News Agency, 15th: China's first self-made helicopter—the Whirlwind Two-Five model helicopter—has begun mass production.

　　The Whirlwind Two-Five model helicopter is equipped with modern navigation and piloting equipment, enabling safe flight at night or in complex weather conditions. This type of aircraft does not require an airport; it can take off and land vertically in any relatively flat area of fifty meters square. It can take off and land on grasslands, pastures, riverbeds, forest gaps, playing fields, street parks, ship decks, and even the flat roofs of large buildings. This helicopter can fly sideways, backwards, or at extremely low altitudes—as low as seven or eight meters above the ground or water. It can also rotate in place or "hover" in the air—remaining stationary in the air.

　　The Whirlwind Two-Five model helicopter is made of domestically produced materials. In terms of flight altitude, speed, and load capacity, it has reached the advanced level of similar helicopters in the world.

　　Because the Whirlwind Two-Five model helicopter has many of the above-mentioned flight characteristics, it has a wide range of uses and can accomplish many special tasks. In high mountain areas where vehicles and horses cannot pass, this helicopter is the most ideal means of transportation, and can quickly transport geological exploration personnel and equipment from one side of the mountain to the other, and from one peak to another. When transporting heavy objects, it can lift them like a crane. Because this aircraft can "hover" in the air and fly at extremely low altitudes, it can also drop rubber boats, lifebuoys, or rope ladders to rescue people in distress at sea, in the desert, or in mountainous areas.

　　This aircraft can also be modified into a special-purpose agricultural, forestry, and fishery aircraft as needed. It can accurately spread pesticides and fertilizers on fields in any narrow mountain gully; in forest protection, it is particularly convenient for surveying forests, eliminating pests and diseases, detecting fires, and transporting firefighters and fire-fighting equipment. After installing fishery equipment, this aircraft can be used to detect fish schools, guide fishing boats, and protect fishermen at sea. The Whirlwind Two-Five model helicopter can also be used for postal services, aerial photography, and aerial surveying. (Attached picture)

### 国产直升飞机成批生产  飞行高度、时速和载重量等达到先进水平

　　国产直升飞机成批生产
    飞行高度、时速和载重量等达到先进水平
    新华社15日讯　我国自制的第一种直升飞机——旋风二五型直升飞机，已经开始成批生产。
    旋风二五型直升飞机设有现代领航和驾驶设备，可以在夜间或复杂的气象条件下安全地飞行。这种飞机不需要机场，只要有五十米见方的比较平坦的地方就可以垂直地起飞和降落。草地、牧场、河床、林隙地、球场、街心公园、舰船甲板甚至大厦平顶等，它都可以起落。这种直升飞机可以左右横飞，向后倒飞，或超低空飞行——最低可以低到离地面或水面七、八米。它还可以原地不动地旋转，也可以在空中“悬停”——悬在空中不动。
    旋风二五型直升飞机是用国产材料制成的。它在飞行的高度、时速和载重量等方面，都达到了世界上同类型直升飞机的先进水平。
    由于旋风二五型直升飞机在飞行上具有上述很多特长，所以它的用途很广，可以完成很多特殊的任务。在车不能通马不能行的高山峻岭地区，这种直升飞机是最理想的运输工具，可以把地质勘探人员和所用的器材，迅速地从大山的这边送到大山的那边，从这个山峰运到另一个山峰。它在运输笨重的东西时，可以像起重机那样吊运。由于这种飞机能在空中“悬停”和超低空飞行，它还可以放下橡皮船、救生圈或软梯，来抢救在海洋、沙漠、山区等地遇险的人员。
    这种飞机也可以根据需要改装成农业、林业和渔业专用机。可以在任何狭窄的山沟里准确地把农药和肥料撒到田里去；在护林方面对普查森林、消灭病虫害、侦察火灾和运送消防人员、消防器材等特别方便。这种飞机安装上渔业设备后，就可以在海洋中侦察鱼群、引导渔船、保护渔民。旋风二五型直升飞机还可以用于邮政、空中摄影、航空探测等方面。（附图片）
