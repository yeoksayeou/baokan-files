Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 18th: In order to win a greater wheat harvest next year, Su County, Anhui Province, based on summarizing this year's wheat harvest experience, requires that all 2.75 million mu of wheat and rapeseed sown in the county meet standards, and every field be converted into raised fields. The 1.09 million mu of wheat that has now been sown basically meets the requirements, with deep plowing generally reaching about eight inches, sufficient base fertilizer applied, seeds treated with medicine, reasonable close planting implemented, and all fields opened with ditches and ridges, realizing the conversion to raised fields.

The Su County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to win a comprehensive wheat harvest next year, had already instructed the communes to summarize wheat high-yield experiences from the bottom up at the end of the summer harvest. In early September, it also specifically convened conferences of cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to specifically discuss how to implement the summarized experience in autumn planting. After full discussion, the county party committee concentrated the opinions of the masses, and based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, put forward ten measures for comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" in this year's autumn planting, requiring all localities to conscientiously implement them in autumn planting. These ten measures are: First, deep plowing of eight inches to one foot is required, without disturbing the soil layers, leveling and harrowing finely, crushing the soil to preserve moisture, and compacting the soil. Second, the ridge width should be seven to eight feet, the ditch width one foot to one foot and two inches, and the ditch depth six to eight inches, with ditches connected to each other for irrigation and drainage. Third, apply 250 dan of base fertilizer per mu. Fourth, vigorously promote good wheat varieties such as "Nanda 2419." Fifth, dry seeds in the sun, winnow, screen, and select seeds with mud or salt water to remove impurities and inferior seeds. Sixth, use 666 powder to mix seeds to prevent underground pests, and use Xilaisheng to mix seeds to prevent wheat bunt. Seventh, reasonable close planting must be implemented. Eighth, use both indigenous and foreign fertilizers, livestock manure, and use manure rakes to sow with fertilizer. Ninth, plow and sow with the harvest, seizing the moisture and sowing, requiring completion before the frost, without missing the agricultural season. Tenth, land preparation, ridge making, fertilization, pest control, and seed treatment must be checked and accepted item by item.

In order to ensure the effective implementation of the ten measures, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels personally took charge and earnestly grasped autumn planting work. The county trained 21,627 plowing hands, 8,844 sowing hands, and 35,295 various technicians. At the same time, in autumn planting, the communes also widely adopted methods such as large-scale appraisals, large-scale collaborations, and field competitions to conscientiously implement the ten measures, which played a great role in promoting the progress of autumn planting and ensuring quality.

At the beginning of autumn planting, the county party committee deployed forces to conduct in-depth inspections in various places, requiring problems to be discovered and solved on the spot to promote autumn planting and improve quality. For example, the Renqiao Commune transferred 284 commune and team cadres to organize eleven inspection teams to conduct in-depth and meticulous inspections block by block and team by team. During the inspection, it was found that the land preparation quality was poor in some places, the sowing was rough, the ridges were of uneven width, and the base fertilizer was insufficient. On the one hand, ideological education was carried out, and on the other hand, special on-site meetings on land preparation, fertilization, and sowing were held in the brigades to correct understanding and learn technology through visits and experiments. For those that did not meet the quality requirements, forces were organized to rework and remedy them. After inspection, in just three days, the entire commune replowed 1,730 mu of land, re-harrowed 2,322 mu, newly built 925 mu of raised fields, repaired 662 mu of raised fields, and increased the application of 1,623 mu of base fertilizer.

　　提出十项具体措施  开展秋种评比协作
    宿县全面贯彻“八字宪法”
    新华社合肥18日电　安徽省宿县为夺取明年小麦更大丰收，在总结今年小麦丰收经验的基础上，要求全县播种的二百七十五万亩小麦、油菜亩亩合标准，丘丘畦田化。现在已播种的一百零九万亩小麦，基本上达到要求，深耕一般都在八寸左右，施足了基肥，种子经过了药剂处理，实行了合理密植，并全部开沟作畦，实现了畦田化。
    中共宿县县委为了夺取明年小麦全面丰收，早在夏收结束时，就布置各公社自下而上地总结了小麦丰产经验。9月初又专门先后召开了干部、老农、技术员大会，具体讨论如何把总结的经验贯彻到秋种中去。经过充分讨论，县委集中了群众意见，根据因地制宜原则，提出了今年秋种全面贯彻“八字宪法”的十项措施，要求各地在秋种中认真执行。这十项措施是：第一、要求深耕八寸至一尺，不乱土层，整平耙细，碎土保墒，沉实土壤。第二、畦宽七至八尺，沟宽一尺至一尺二寸，沟深六至八寸，沟沟相通，能灌能排。第三、每亩施基肥二百五十担。第四、大力推广南大二四一九等小麦良种。第五、晒种、风选、筛选、泥水或盐水选种，去杂去劣。第六、用六六六药粉拌种防治地下害虫，用西力生拌种防治麦类黑穗病。第七、要实行合理密植。第八、要用土洋化肥、牲畜粪，利用粪耧子带肥播种。第九、随收随耕，抢墒播种，要求霜降前结束，不误农时。第十、整地、作畦、施肥、防虫及种子处理等都要逐项检查验收。
    为了保证十项措施切实执行，各级党委第一书记都亲自挂帅，认真抓秋种工作。全县训练了犁田手二万一千六百二十七名，耩田手八千八百四十四名，训练了各种技术员三万五千二百九十五人。同时各公社在秋种中还广泛采用了大评比、大协作、田头比武等办法，认真贯彻十项措施，这些对促进秋种进度保证质量都起了很大推动作用。
    县委在秋种一开始，就部署各地组织力量进行深入检查，要求就地发现问题，就地解决，以推动秋种，提高质量。例如任桥公社抽调社、队干部二百八十四人，组织十一个检查组，逐块逐队，深入细致地进行检查，在检查中发现部分地方整地质量差，播种粗糙，畦田宽窄不一，施基肥不足，就一方面进行思想教育，一方面分别在大队召开整地、施肥、播种等专题现场会议，通过参观、试验，端正认识，学习技术。对于不合质量要求的，又组织力量重新加工补救。经过检查，仅三天时间，全社重新翻耕地一千七百三十亩，重耙二千三百二十二亩，新打畦田九百二十五亩，整修畦田六百六十二亩，增施基肥一千六百二十三亩。
