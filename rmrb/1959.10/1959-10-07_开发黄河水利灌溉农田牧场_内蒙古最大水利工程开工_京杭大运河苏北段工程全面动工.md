Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 5th: The Sanshenggong Water Conservancy Hub Project in the Yellow River Inner Mongolia Irrigation Area recently commenced construction. On the banks of the surging Yellow River, flags are flying on the construction site, and thousands of workers from various ethnic groups are working intensely on the steel reinforcement and concrete pouring of the stilling basin of the intake gate, one of the main structures.

The Yellow River Sanshenggong Water Conservancy Hub Project is one of the main projects in the first phase of controlling the Yellow River's flood hazards and comprehensively developing the Yellow River's water resources. It includes structures such as intake gates, diversion dams, sand flushing gates, sediment settling gates, spillway gates, hydroelectric power stations, control gates, and ship locks, as well as a complete irrigation canal system and drainage system. It is a large-scale water conservancy project unprecedented in Inner Mongolia's history. Upon completion of the entire project, a 350-kilometer-long modern main canal will be built along the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway from Sanshenggong in the east to the west of Hohhot. It can irrigate all the farmland in the Hetao Plain, the Sanhu River irrigation area, and the suburbs of Baotou, as well as parts of the Tumochuan and Ordos grasslands and pastures, with an irrigation area of 17 million mu. At the same time, more than 60,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment will be installed here. Its canals and dikes will become an important waterway and highway artery from Baotou to Sanshenggong.

The Sanshenggong Hub Project on the Yellow River has received enthusiastic support from relevant central departments and fraternal provinces and regions from the beginning of surveying to the early construction. Soviet experts have also provided specific guidance and assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 5th: The Northern Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal project recently fully commenced. More than 200,000 laborers who are tasked with year-round construction are gathering at the construction site. Everywhere along the 400-kilometer-long canal, one can see scenes of intense construction.

The Northern Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal project began construction last year, encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and with the strong support of the people's communes. The structures that have been built and are about to be built along the route include the Jietai Zi, Liu Shanzi, and Linjiaba three control gates and the Suqian ship lock; under construction are the Pixian Canal Grand Iron Bridge, the Shaobo ship lock, the Yangzhou and other three highway bridges, and the Xuzhou's three port coal wharves.

The Northern Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal is scheduled to be roughly completed by the end of next year. The entire section, from Linjiaba in the Xuzhou area to the mouth of the Yangtze River, is more than 400 kilometers long. After rough completion, it will not only allow the passage of 2,000-ton fleets, but also play a significant role in flood control, drainage, irrigation, and power generation.

The people of various areas in northern Jiangsu, especially those along the route, enthusiastically signed up to participate in digging this "Happiness River" after hearing the news of the canal construction. All regions and departments have promoted the spirit of great collaboration and supported a large amount of manpower and materials. (Attached picture)

    开发黄河水利灌溉农田牧场
    内蒙古最大水利工程开工
    京杭大运河苏北段工程全面动工
    据新华社呼和浩特5日电　黄河内蒙古灌区三盛公水利枢纽工程最近动工兴建。在滚滚奔流的黄河的岸边工地上，红旗招展，数千名各族职工正在紧张地进行着主体工程之一——进水闸静水池的钢筋混凝土浇灌工作。
    黄河三盛公水利枢纽工程，是根治黄河水害和综合开发黄河水利第一期工程的主要项目之一，包括进水闸、拦河闸、冲砂闸、沉砂闸、泄水闸、水电站、节制闸、船闸等建筑物，另外还有完整的灌溉渠系和排水系统。它是内蒙古历史上从未有过的一个大型水利工程。全部工程竣工以后，自三盛公以东到呼和浩特以西，沿着包兰铁路，将建成一条长达三百五十公里的现代化的总干渠，可以灌溉河套平原、三湖河灌域、包头郊区的全部农田，以及土默川、鄂尔多斯草原的部分土地和牧场，灌溉面积达一千七百万亩。同时，这里还将安装六万多瓩的发电设备。它的渠道及堤坝，将成为包头到三盛公的重要航道和公路干线。
    黄河三盛公枢纽工程从开始勘测到提前施工，得到了中央有关部门和兄弟省区的热情支援。苏联专家也给予了具体的指导和帮助。
    据新华社南京5日电　京杭大运河苏北段工程最近全面动工。担负常年施工任务的二十多万劳动大军，正陆续云集工地。在四百多公里长的运河线上，到处可以看到紧张的施工景象。
    京杭大运河苏北段工程，是在去年工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞下和人民公社的大力支持下开始施工的。沿线已经建成和即将建成的建筑物，有解台子、刘山子、蔺家坝三座节制闸和宿迁船闸；正在施工的有邳县运河大铁桥、邵伯船闸、扬州等三座公路桥和徐州的三处港埠煤码头。
    京杭大运河苏北段工程将在明年年底粗通。全段工程，从徐州专区的蔺家坝到长江口，全长四百多公里，粗通后不仅可以先航行二千吨的船队，而且在防洪、排涝、灌溉和发电等方面，将发挥巨大作用。
    苏北各专区人民尤其是沿线人民，听到修运河的消息之后，都踊跃报名，参加开挖这条“幸福河”。各地区和各部门都发扬大协作精神，支援了大批人力、物力。（附图片）
