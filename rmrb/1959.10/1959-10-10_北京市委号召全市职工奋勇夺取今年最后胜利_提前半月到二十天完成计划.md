Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Beijing Municipal Party Committee, at a meeting of leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises in the city held on the 8th, issued a battle call to all workers in the city: "Go all out, seize the opportunity, and strive to complete this year's production plan half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule, and actively prepare for production in the first quarter of next year."
    The situation on the industrial and transportation front in Beijing is currently very good. Because of the resolute implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies and inspiring enthusiasm, the city's vast number of workers have launched a widespread socialist labor emulation drive to seize high quality, strive for high output, complete plans ahead of schedule, and strive for an "all-round red" result. Technological innovation and technological revolution have become mass movements; leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the production front lines to direct production. Therefore, the city's total industrial output value in September increased by 23% compared with August and by 36% compared with the same period last year, becoming the month with the highest production level this year. From January to September, the city's cumulative total industrial output value has exceeded the total for the entire year of last year. The output of major products such as steel, steel products, pig iron, and raw coal have all reached the highest levels this year. Steel, steel products, and pig iron increased by 31%, 39%, and 21% respectively compared with August. The coal output of the Jingxi Coal Mine increased by 25% compared with August. Product quality continued to improve. The transportation front also overfulfilled its plan.
    After celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the morale of the workers in various factories and mines is even higher, and many factories have achieved a "red opening" in October. From the 1st to the 4th, the Jingxi Coal Mine planned to produce 45,000 tons of coal, but actually completed 52,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 15.88%. On the first day of production on the 4th at the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, all nine branches of the factory completed their daily plans, with the daily output value and output exceeding the plan by 55% and 16% respectively. Now, all the city's workers are bravely fighting for the goal of "daily red" and "all-month red".
    The meeting pointed out that although the city's industrial and transportation fronts had achieved great results in the first three quarters, the task for the last quarter is still quite arduous. It is necessary to seize the current favorable opportunity, advance victoriously, and strive to complete the annual plan half a month to twenty days ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter. Based on this goal, the meeting put forward specific requirements for major products such as steel, pig iron, steel products, and coal to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule. In order to achieve a greater leap forward next year and ensure that the production level in the first quarter of next year is no lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year, the meeting required all relevant departments and factories and mines to actively prepare for production in the first quarter of next year, such as ordering raw materials and equipment, repairing machinery and equipment, and stocking up on semi-finished products.
    In order to successfully complete the arduous tasks of the fourth quarter, the meeting pointed out that all factories and mining enterprises must continue to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, further mobilize the masses, oppose right-leaning tendencies, and inspire enthusiasm. All units should hold mass meetings in the next few days to talk about the situation, assign tasks, and launch a larger-scale upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy. It is necessary to further grasp technological innovation and technological revolution, grasp socialist labor emulation, promote advanced experience, and guide the masses to reach higher production levels. It is necessary to strengthen the coordination of raw materials, further tap the potential of materials, and do a good job in transportation. All factories and mining enterprises and all industrial bureaus should focus on transportation while grasping production. It is necessary to strengthen leadership, grasp measures, grasp scheduling, and seize the opportunity to solve problems. All enterprises should check the completion of production plans every day and every shift.
    The meeting finally pointed out that in the great leap forward in production, special attention should be paid to improving product quality and increasing product variety, strengthening production safety work, and paying attention to saving coal and electricity.

    北京市委号召全市职工奋勇夺取今年最后胜利
    提前半月到二十天完成计划
    新华社9日讯　“鼓足干劲，抓紧时机，力争提前半个月到二十天完成今年生产计划，积极进行明年第一季度的生产准备工作”。这是中共北京市委在8日召开的全市工矿企业领导干部会议上向全市职工发出的战斗号召。
    当前北京市工业交通运输战线上的形势非常好。由于坚决贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议，不断地反右倾、鼓干劲，全市广大职工夺优质争高产、提前完成计划、争取“满堂红”的社会主义劳动竞赛，已经广泛展开；技术革新和技术革命已经成为群众性的运动；各级领导干部深入生产前线指挥生产。因此，全市9月份工业总产值比8月份提高23％，比去年同期提高了36％，成为今年以来生产水平最高的一个月份。1月至9月全市累计工业总产值已超过去年全年的总和。钢、钢材、生铁、原煤等主要产品产量都达到了今年以来的最高水平，钢、钢材、生铁分别比8月提高了31％、39％和21％，京西煤矿煤产量比8月份提高了25％；产品质量继续提高。交通运输战线也超额完成了计划。
    欢庆建国十周年以后，各厂矿职工的斗志更加昂扬，很多工厂做到了10月生产“开门红”。京西煤矿1日至4日计划产煤四万五千吨，实际完成五万二千吨，超额15.88％。北京电子管厂4日开工生产的第一天，全厂九个分厂都完成了日计划，当天的日产值和产量分别超过计划55％和16％。现在全市职工正为“日日红”“全月红”的目标英勇奋战。
    会议指出，前三个季度全市工业交通战线上虽然取得了很大成绩，但最后一个季度的任务仍然相当艰巨，必须抓住当前的大好时机，乘胜前进，在第四季度内一鼓作气，力争提前半个月到二十天完成全年计划。会议根据这一目标，提出了钢、生铁、钢材、煤等主要产品提前完成全年计划的具体要求。为了明年更大跃进，使明年第一季度的生产水平不低于今年第四季度，会议要求各有关部门和各厂矿必须同时积极进行明年第一季度的生产准备工作，如原材料、设备订货、机器设备检修、半成品储备等。
    为了胜利完成第四季度的艰巨任务，会议指出各厂矿企业必须继续深入地贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议，进一步深入发动群众，反右倾，鼓干劲。各单位要在最近几天内召开群众大会，讲形势，交任务，发动更大规模的增产节约高潮。要进一步抓技术革新和技术革命，抓社会主义劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，引导群众达到更高的生产水平。要加强原材料的调剂，进一步挖掘物资潜力，作好运输工作。各厂矿企业、各工业局在抓生产的同时，要抓运输。要加强领导，抓措施，抓调度，抓紧解决问题，各企业要天天、班班检查生产计划的完成情况。
    会议最后指出，在生产大跃进中，要特别注意提高产品质量和增加产品品种，加强生产安全工作，并且注意节约煤电。
