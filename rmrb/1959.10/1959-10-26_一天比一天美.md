    More Beautiful Day by Day
    The national commercial system's purchase volume of native and special products in the third quarter increased more than twofold compared to the same period last year. The tea procurement plan has been overfulfilled, and the agricultural product purchase campaign centered on grain, cotton, and oil is also progressing rapidly, with purchases being both plentiful and of high quality.
    The doubled increase in commercial purchases reflects the bumper harvest in agricultural production and the development of diversified operations in the People's Communes. The People's Commune, this brand-new form of social organization, is a guarantee for the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Since the establishment of the People's Communes, China's social productive forces have had a broad field for development. The communes not only have the strength to overcome various natural disasters and ensure agricultural harvests, but also have the strength to manage small-scale, scattered, and wild products, organize strong collection teams and transportation forces, and have launched a high tide of agricultural and sideline products and native and special products purchasing with a mighty force. The facts are crystal clear. If the communes had not developed solidly and healthily, and if diversified operations had not developed, could the national purchase volume of native and special products have increased by double compared to the same period last year? All the malicious slanders made by right-leaning opportunists against the People's Communes and the market situation have once again gone bankrupt in the face of ironclad facts and amidst the sounds of triumphant news.
    The diversified operations of the People's Communes are developing day by day, the purchase volume of commercial departments is increasing day by day, industrial production records are being refreshed day by day, and the national market situation will be more prosperous day by day. This is the excellent situation on our commercial front.

    一天比一天美
    全国商业系统土特产品收购额第三季度比去年同期增长一倍以上，茶叶采购计划已超额完成，以粮棉油为中心的农产品收购运动也进展神速，收购的又多又好。
    商业收购量的成倍增长，反映了农业生产的丰收和人民公社多种经营的发展。人民公社这一崭新的社会组织形式，是促进工农业生产不断大跃进的保证。自从有了人民公社，我国的社会生产力就有了广阔发展的阵地。公社不仅有力量战胜各种自然灾害，确保农业丰收，而且有力量把小宗的、分散的、野生的产品管起来，组织强大的采集队伍和运输力量，掀起了千军万马的农副产品和土特产品的收购高潮。事实是一清二楚的。如果公社没有巩固地健康地发展，没有多种经营的发展，全国土特产的收购额能比去年同期增长一倍么？右倾机会主义者对人民公社和市场形势所进行的一切恶意的诽谤，再一次在铁的事实面前、在胜利的捷报声中破产了。
    人民公社的多种经营一天天发展，商业部门收购量一天天增长，工业生产纪录一天天刷新，全国的市场状况就会一天比一天繁荣，这就是我们商业战线上的大好形势。
