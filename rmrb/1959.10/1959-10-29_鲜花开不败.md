Flowers are loved for their lushness, vibrancy, and fragrance. Yet, people often feel a tinge of regret because they don't last long. Some with unhealthy thoughts and emotions pointlessly lament, saying "Good flowers don't bloom forever, good times don't last." Let's leave such nonsense aside.

I want to talk about flowers in a different sense, flowers that not only bloom luxuriantly, vividly, and fragrantly but also never wither, growing stronger and more vibrant over time. These are what we often refer to as "leap forward flowers." Truly: Leap forward flowers bloom red, heroes emerge from every front, the waves of the future chase the waves of the past, striving to perform great deeds for the motherland.

The National Congress of Heroes is currently being held in Beijing, with heroes from all walks of life gathered together, a true spectacle of a hundred flowers blooming in competition, a riot of color, with warm breezes and fragrance spreading throughout the country. Among these flowers, I want to especially mention the Ma Wanshui Group of the Pangjiabao Iron Mine in the Longyan Iron and Steel Company.

Since its establishment in December 1949, this group has consistently exceeded the state plan ahead of schedule every month, remaining the national champion in tunneling for black metal mines. They have also set the national record for black metal mine tunneling nine times. Truly, a decade of champions, nine ascents to the peak, flowers that never fade, blooming ever more red.

Why does this group perform so well, with its flowers blooming ever more vibrantly? There are naturally many reasons, which are worthy of our diligent study.

First, the workers in this group possess soaring enthusiasm, a spirit of diligent research, and the courage to overcome difficulties. They continuously innovate technology and create inventions. Over the past ten years, they have developed more than two hundred large and small pieces of advanced experience, some specializing in rock, others in controlling quicksand, some in drilling holes, others in loading explosives and transporting materials. Combined, they form a relatively complete set of rapid mining and tunneling experiences.

Second, the group does a good job in technical education. When new workers arrive, veteran workers immediately sign apprenticeship contracts with them, guaranteeing instruction and learning. All eighty workers in the group study diligently and practice hard, achieving proficiency in multiple skills. Truly: One person has skills, everyone comes to learn. Diligent study and hard practice, everyone has many abilities.

Third, competition is good, and the style is high. Competition has become a way of life for the workers in the Ma Wanshui Group. Competition motivates them to continuously boost their energy and strive for the top. In the competition, they not only race against the clock but also possess a noble communist style. In 1958 alone, they dispatched personnel to help other groups and teams twenty times, sending their best technicians and imparting their experience without reservation.

Fourth, and most importantly, they have strengthened the leadership of the Party and paid attention to meticulous ideological education. Whenever new workers arrive, the group focuses first on political and ideological education, raising their awareness and earnestly admonishing them to protect and carry forward the collective honor of the Ma Wanshui Group. Even stricter requirements are set for veteran workers.

It is these factors that enable the Ma Wanshui Group to continuously advance and remain a model worker group in production. Because they are always thinking about how to create wealth for the country and win honor for the collective, and not for anything else. Therefore, their flowers bloom more luxuriantly, more red, and never wither. And what is even more worthy of our learning is that they not only pay attention to making their own flowers bloom well but also want to make everyone's flowers bloom well, so that good flowers can be propagated. Over the past ten years, this group has cultivated a large number of construction talents for the country. None of the veteran workers before 1951 remain among the current eighty workers; all have been promoted to leading cadres. They have sent seventy-three workers to serve as workshop and work area-level cadres and have also trained one hundred and sixty technicians to supplement and strengthen themselves.

This kind of work spirit, this noble communist style, is truly worthy of our praise, worthy of our learning! And in our country, there are more than just thousands upon thousands of flowers that never wither like the Ma Wanshui Group!

    鲜花开不败
    易和元
    好花惹人喜爱，人们爱它开的茂盛，鲜艳，开的香气袭人。然而大家总不免多少有点遗憾，因为它们开得不那么长久。有些思想情绪不健康的人就无端慨叹，说什么“好花不常开，好景不常在”。这些胡说八道，且不去管它。
    我要说的是另外一种意义的花，它非但开得茂盛，鲜艳，香气袭人，而且永不雕零，越开越旺。这就是现在我们经常比喻的“跃进之花”。正是：跃进花开朵朵红，条条战线出英雄，后浪滔滔追前浪，争为祖国立大功。
    现在群英会正在北京召开，各路英雄济济一堂，真是百花争艳，万紫千红，煦风阵阵，香飘全国。在百花中，我想特别提一提的是龙烟钢铁公司庞家堡铁矿马万水小组。
    这个小组自1949年12月成立以来，月月提前超额完成国家计划，一直是全国黑色金属矿山掘进冠军，而且九次创造了全国黑色金属矿山掘进最高纪录。真是十年居冠军，九次登高峰，鲜花开不败，越开花越红。
    这个小组工作为什么作得这样好，花越开越红？其中自然有很多道理，而这些正是值得我们努力学习的。
    首先，这个小组的工人，具有冲天的干劲，努力钻研和勇于克服困难的精神，他们不断革新技术、创造发明。十年来，他们创造的先进经验，大大小小就有二百件以上，有专攻岩石的，也有制止流沙的，有打眼的，也有装药、运输的，加起来，便是一套比较完整的矿山快速掘进经验。
    第二是小组的技术教育作得好。新工人来了，老工人马上与他们签订师徒合同，包教包学。全组八十名工人，个个勤学苦练，做到了一人多艺。正是：一人有技术，大家都来学。勤学又苦练，人人本领多。
    第三是竞赛好，风格高。竞赛已经成为马万水小组工人的生活习惯。竞赛激励着他们不断鼓干劲，争上游。他们在竞赛中不仅是分秒必争，而且有着崇高的共产主义风格。光在1958年，就曾二十次派出人员帮助别的组、队，而且都是派最好的技术工人，无保留地传授经验。
    第四，也是最重要的一点是加强了党的领导，注意细致的思想教育工作。每逢新工人来了，小组抓的首先是政治思想教育，提高他们的觉悟，并且谆谆告诫要保护和发扬马万水小组的集体荣誉。对于老工人更是要求严格。
    正是这些，使马万水小组不断前进，一直是生产中的标兵。因为他们时刻想着的是如何为国家创造财富，为集体争取荣誉，而不是为了其他的什么。因此他们的花越开越茂盛，越开越红，永不雕零。而更值得我们学习的是，他们不仅注意使自己的花开得好，而且要使大家的花都开得好，使好花繁殖起来。十年来，这个小组为国家培养了大批建设人才。现在的八十名工人中，1951年前的老工人一个也没有了，都被提升为领导干部。输送了七十三名工人担任车间、工区一级干部，同时又培养了一百六十名技工，补充和壮大了自己。
    这种工作精神，这种崇高的共产主义风格，真是值得我们歌颂，值得我们学习！而像马万水小组这样永不雕谢的花，在我们国家里又何止千朵万朵！
