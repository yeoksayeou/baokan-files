Not Abandoning Any Technological Innovation, Not Relaxing for Even a Second
Tian Jingqi Completes Six Years' Worth of Work in a Little Over a Year

Chengdu, October 22nd (By Our Own Correspondent) Tian Jingqi, a lathe operator at the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and a representative to the National People's Congress, has completed six years and nine months' worth of work in one year and eight months. Since he returned to production in February of last year, he is now working on the fourth quarter of 1964, according to the factory's established quotas. Recently, he initiated a friendly competition with Wei Gaohou, the famous young Red Banner pacesetter and milling machine operator from the Chongqing Chang'an Machinery Factory, determined to complete three more years' worth of work in the fourth quarter of this year, responding with practical action to the Party Central Committee's great call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

Tian Jingqi is a veteran lathe operator with ten years of experience. In October 1956, he left production to serve as the foreman of the tool workshop in the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. In February of last year, after repeated requests, he was approved to return to the team as a worker. He then formulated a plan to complete the workload of the Second Five-Year Plan in three years, and he was determined to lead the masses in doing a good job in production with the exemplary actions of a Communist Party member. In the first month of participating in production, Tian Jingqi completed a quarter's worth of work. He then revised his plan twice, and this plan was realized ahead of schedule in May of this year. Since June, he has continued to make great leaps forward. In the four months from June to September, he completed another one year and nine months' worth of work. The quality of the more than 50,000 products processed in these twenty months reached 99.9%, and safe production was achieved.

Over the past year, Tian Jingqi, as an advanced producer in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City, served as a representative to the National People's Congress and a member of the factory's Party committee, and often had to participate in social activities. His actual production time was less than sixteen months, but he stubbornly improved his technology and still greatly overfulfilled the production plan. He has always been enthusiastic and energetic in production, never relaxing for even a second. In actual operation, he explored a set of "three diligences" and "four speeds" operation methods, namely: diligently check the machine, diligently check the drawings, diligently check the quality; quick in clamping workpieces and measuring workpieces, quick in grinding and mounting tools, quick in advancing and retracting the tool, and quick in lathe speed. Every day of the year, Tian Jingqi always went to work early to prepare tools, familiarize himself with drawings, inspect machine tools, and consider construction methods. After work, he devoted himself to production. His cutting efficiency is one to two times higher than that of ordinary workers, and the machine tool operates for one hour to more than one hour longer each day. Therefore, according to the workshop's regulations, he should do 480 minutes of work in eight hours every day, but he often completes about 2,000 minutes of tasks, reaching a maximum of more than 4,000 minutes, often exceeding the quota by three or four times.

With the continuous development of production, under the education and help of the Party organization, he thought that in order to ensure that the state plan was comprehensively overfulfilled, he had to constantly use his brains to find ways and tricks to make himself the master of the machine. He said: "There is no limit to the improvement of technology. We must treat production like revolutionary work, constantly revolutionize nature, and constantly improve technology." In technological innovation, Tian Jingqi was not satisfied with one or two improvements. He did not give up any large or small subjects. As long as it could improve production, he would find ways to use his brains. When processing a kind of milling cutter, he modified a special tool, and the original ability to process only one piece at a time was leaped to processing twenty pieces at a time, increasing work efficiency by 18 times. When turning 30-40 mm drill hook milling cutters, he disliked the slow lathe speed, so he gradually tested and increased the speed from 57 revolutions to 120 revolutions, 150 revolutions, and finally increased it to 360 revolutions, so that the work efficiency increased from one time, two times to six times. From February of last year to now, Tian Jingqi has innovated a total of more than 400 projects in equipment, tools, products, operations, etc., with the highest increase in work efficiency of 400 times. At the same time, with a humble and cautious attitude, he used opportunities such as visits, participating in various social activities, attending advanced experience exchange meetings, and seeking teachers and friends everywhere to learn from others' advanced experiences. At present, he has successively learned from others about his more advanced aspects in high-speed driving, heavy cutting, multi-tool and multi-blade cutting, and powerful cutting, and used others' experiences to further improve his technology. Therefore, the workers in the factory not only regard him as a production expert, but also regard him as a pacesetter in technological revolution and an example for themselves to learn from.

Tian Jingqi always remembers the Party's teachings: advanced producers should not only be advanced themselves, but also help others reach advanced levels. Under his influence and help, all 24 workers in the lathe team he leads have now completed the equivalent of the 1960 workload, and 17 Red Banner hands, clever girls, and outstanding apprentices have emerged. This year, it has been rated as an advanced collective in Chengdu City. In September, the grinder team in the tool workshop was unable to improve the efficiency of processing threaded ring gauges, which became the biggest key in the workshop's production. The workshop Party branch transferred him from the lathe team to the grinder team to serve as the team leader. After Tian Jingqi was transferred to this team, under the leadership of the Party branch, he actively mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and methods. In less than a month, this team leaped from failing to complete the plan in the past to become the first-class advanced team in the entire workshop.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session were announced, Tian Jingqi was greatly encouraged. He responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions. In September, while completing nearly six months' worth of work in twenty working days, he also actively helped brother factories and brother workshops to solve key production problems. He said that the Party Central Committee called on all employees in the country to realize the main targets stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. All factories, workshops, teams, and workers in the country must reach advanced levels, and the ranks of advanced producers must be expanded to every corner in order to accelerate China's socialist construction. In August and September, Tian Jingqi used his spare time to go to the Chengdu Electric Motor Manufacturing Factory six times. He helped all lathe workers in the factory solve a series of technical problems, increasing the workshop's production efficiency by 40% in more than a month, thus balancing the production of various workshops in the factory and promoting the factory's total output value in September to increase by one time compared with August, which was encouraged by the Party Committee of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. Recently, he and Xu Guohua, Zhong Zhigang, Zhang Zhaoan and other six pacesetters from the factory organized a "Red Flag Service Team". Wherever there are difficulties, they will go to solve them, and wherever there is a need, they will support them. In a very short period of time, the "Red Flag Service Team" helped the electromechanical workshop to break through the key to the processing of spring sheets, increasing work efficiency by 320 times. Now they are helping the steel plant to test the use of stamping machines instead of manual bricklaying, and are preparing to further help realize the mechanization of transportation, crushing and other heavy physical labor, improve work efficiency, reduce labor intensity, and liberate the labor force.

Tian Jingqi's advanced deeds and advanced thoughts have attracted the attention of the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Sichuan Province. In the competition of learning from Tian Jingqi and catching up with each other, many advanced figures have emerged in many factories. Hundreds of factories in Chengdu City, focusing on learning from Tian Jingqi and Pang Renying and actively helping the backward to catch up with the advanced communist style, put forward the heroic slogan of "no backwardness beside the advanced," and generally formulated plans to help the backward catch up with the advanced. In the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, only the measuring tool and cutting tool workshops have had 25 teams leap from poor task completion to become advanced teams in the entire factory in the competition of learning from Tian Jingqi. In the tool workshop where Tian Jingqi is located, 36 people have completed more than two years of workload this year, and 10 people have completed three years of work.

    不放弃任何技术革新　不放松一分一秒时间
    田景琦一年多干完六年活
    本报成都22日电　全国人民代表大会代表、成都量具刃具厂车工田景琦以一年零八个月的时间完成了六年零九个月的工作量，他从去年2月份参加生产，按工厂规定的定额计算现在已在做1964年第四季度的工作了。最近他又和著名青年红旗手、重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚展开了友谊竞赛，决心在今年第四季度再做完三年的工作，以实际行动响应党中央关于在今年提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召。
    田景琦是一个有十年工龄的老车工。1956年10月他脱产担任了成都量具刃具厂工具车间的工长。去年2月经过他的再三申请，被批准重新回到小组当工人时，他就制定了以三年时间完成第二个五年计划工作量的规划，并决心以共产党员的模范行动带领群众一齐搞好生产。参加生产的第一个月，田景琦就做完了一个季度的工作，接着他两次修改了自己的规划，到今年5月这个规划就提前实现了。从6月开始他又继续大跃进，6月份到9月份的四个月中又做完了一年零九个月的工作。这二十个月中加工出来的五万多件产品质量达到99.9％，并且做到了安全生产。
    一年多来，田景琦因为是四川省和成都市的先进生产者，担任了全国人民代表大会代表和工厂党委委员等职务，经常要参加社会活动，实际生产时间不到十六个月，但他顽强地改进技术，仍然大大超额完成了生产计划。他在生产上始终热情饱满，精力充沛，从不放松一分一秒时间。在实际操作中他摸索出了一套“三勤”“四快”的操作方法，即：勤检查机器、勤检查图纸，勤检查质量；卡活量活快，磨刀上刀快，进刀退刀快，车床转速快。一年三百六十天田景琦每天总提前上班，准备工具，熟悉图纸，检查机床，考虑施工方法，上班后就全神贯注在生产上。他的切削效率要比一般工人高一倍到两倍，机床每天的开动时间也要多一小时至一小时以上。因此按车间规定每天八小时应做四百八十分钟的活，他经常要完成二千分钟左右的任务，最高达到四千多分钟，经常超过定额三、四倍。
    随着生产不断发展，在党组织的教育和帮助下，他想到要经常保证做到全面超额完成国家计划，就要不断开动脑筋想办法、找窍门，使自己成为驾驭机器的主人。他说：“技术的提高是没有限度的，对待生产也要像对待革命工作一样，要不断革自然的命，不断提高技术。”在技术革新中，田景琦不满足于一次二次的改进，他不放弃任何大小课题，只要能提高生产都要想办法动动脑筋。在加工一种铣刀时，他改制了一副专用工具，由原来一次只能加工一件跃进到一次加工二十件，提高工效十八倍。车制三十—四十米厘钻头钩铣刀，他嫌车床转速太慢了，便逐步试验将转速由五十七转提高到一百二十转、一百五十转，最后提高到三百六十转，使工效由提高一倍、两倍直至提高到六倍。从去年2月到现在，田景琦在设备、工具、产品、操作等各个方面共革新了四百多个项目，最高提高工效四百倍。同时他还以谦虚谨慎的态度，利用参观访问，参加各种社会活动，出席先进经验交流会，以及到处寻师访友等机会，学习别人的先进经验。目前他已先后在开快车、吃大刀、多刀多刃、强力切削等方面学习了别人比他先进的地方，用别人的经验来进一步提高了自己的技术。因此全厂工人不但认为他是一位生产能手，而且把他当成技术革命的标兵，作为自己学习的榜样。
    田景琦时刻记住党的教导：先进生产者不仅要自己先进，还要帮助别人达到先进水平。他所领导的车工小组在他的影响和帮助下，全组二十四个工人现在都已做完了相当于1960年的工作量，并涌现出红旗手、巧姑娘、优秀学工十七人，今年已被评选为成都市的先进集体。9月份工具车间研磨器小组因为加工螺纹环规工效提不高，成为全车间生产中的一个最大关键，车间党支部把他从车工小组调到研磨器小组担任小组长。田景琦调到这个小组后，在党支部领导下，积极发动群众出主意，想办法，不到一个月这个小组就从过去完不成计划一跃而为全车间一等先进小组。
    八中全会公报和决议公布后，田景琦受到了极大的鼓舞。他用实际行动响应党中央的伟大号召，9月份在以二十个工作日做完了将近六个月工作量的同时，还积极帮助兄弟工厂和兄弟车间突击解决生产关键。他说，党中央号召全国职工提前三年在今年实现第二个五年计划所规定的主要指标，就要使全国所有的工厂、车间、小组、工人都达到先进水平，把先进生产者队伍扩大到每一个角落，才能加速我国社会主义建设。8、9两个月中，田景琦利用业余时间，曾六次赶到成都电动机制造厂。帮助全厂车工解决了一系列的技术问题，使车间生产效率在一个多月中提高40％，因而使这个工厂各个车间的生产平衡了，促进全厂9月份生产总值比
  8月份增长了一倍，受到成都量具刃具厂党委的鼓励。最近他又和全厂标兵徐国华、钟志刚、张兆安等六人组织了一个“红旗服务队”，哪里有困难就到哪里突击解决，哪里需要就支援到哪里。在很短时间中，“红旗服务队”就帮助机电车间突破了弹簧片加工的关键，提高工效三百二十倍。现在他们正在帮助炼钢厂试验用冲压机代替人工打砖，并准备进一步再帮助实现运输、破碎等重体力劳动机械化，提高工效，减轻劳动强度，解放劳动力。
    田景琦的先进事迹和先进思想，已引起四川省工业战线广大职工的注意。许多工厂在学习田景琦的你追我赶的竞赛中，已涌现出大量先进人物。成都市几百个工厂围绕学习田景琦、庞仁英积极帮助落后赶上先进的共产主义风格，提出“先进旁边无落后”的豪迈口号，普遍订出了帮助落后赶上先进的规划。成都量具刃具厂仅量具和刃具两个车间，在学习田景琦的竞赛中就已有二十五个小组由过去任务完成不好跃进为全厂先进小组。田景琦所在的工具车间，有三十六人今年已完成了两年以上的工作量，十人做完了三年的工作。
