    The Party Central Committee and the State Council Issue a Call to Battle
    Vigorously Develop "Water" and "Fertilizer" to Ensure Continued Great Leap Forward in Agriculture Next Year
    Water conservancy is still the fundamental problem in developing agricultural production at present. In the next few winters and springs, we will launch several more high tides of water conservancy construction, striving to achieve water conservancy in a relatively short period. This is a major task for the whole party and the whole people to build socialism. The current situation is very good, which is very conducive to vigorously developing water conservancy. It is entirely possible to continue to launch a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, and to make it more majestic, more organized, more efficient and of better quality than the water conservancy upsurge in 1958. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must fully recognize this situation and actively lead this movement.

    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on October 24 on continuing to launch a large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement this winter and next spring. The full text is as follows:
    Instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Continuing to Launch a Large-Scale Water Conservancy and Fertilizer Accumulation Movement This Winter and Next Spring October 24, 1959
    This year, some provinces in southern and northern China have suffered severe floods, and the vast areas in the central region are threatened by extremely severe droughts. Thanks to the encouragement of the General Line and the strong leadership of party committees at all levels, relying on the large number of water conservancy projects built over the years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, and relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, we have organized large-scale cooperation and support and large-scale operations, enabling us to achieve great victories in the fight against floods and droughts. This has not only greatly reduced the affected area and mitigated the degree of disaster, but also ensured that agricultural production this year continues to leap forward on the basis of last year's extraordinary harvest. On the other hand, although our existing water conservancy facilities are not small, they are still unbalanced in terms of region, the drought and flood resistance capacity of many projects is still low, and some projects are of poor quality or not systematic enough to fully发挥 their benefits. Judging from the drought and flood resistance situation in various places this summer, most agricultural areas still cannot guarantee high and stable yields under the attack of extremely severe drought and flood disasters. Therefore, water conservancy is still the fundamental problem in developing agricultural production at present. In the next few winters and springs, we will launch several more high tides of water conservancy construction, striving to achieve water conservancy in a relatively short period. This is a major task for the whole party and the whole people to build socialism.
    The current situation is very good, which is very conducive to vigorously developing water conservancy: the General Line shines brightly; the superiority of the people's communes is becoming more and more apparent; industry will further support farmland water conservancy construction; various places have rich successful experiences in mass-based mountain and water management; grassroots water conservancy technical forces have grown up in batches; the great victory in this year's fight against drought and flood has encouraged the masses' ambition and determination to transform nature; especially since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the anti-Rightist and morale-boosting campaign has shattered the Rightist opportunists' slanders and attacks on water conservancy construction, so the enthusiasm of the broad masses to develop production has been unprecedentedly high. Therefore, it is entirely possible to continue to launch a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, and to make it more majestic, more organized, more efficient and of better quality than the water conservancy upsurge in 1958. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must fully recognize this situation and actively lead this movement.
    1. The people's commune is the new foundation of the water conservancy movement, bringing many new characteristics to the water conservancy movement: it facilitates the undertaking of larger backbone projects, combining large, medium and small water conservancy projects; it facilitates the linking of previously scattered and isolated projects to form a relatively complete irrigation and drainage system; it facilitates the overall planning and comprehensive development of small and medium-sized rivers throughout the basin in conjunction with the management of large rivers; it facilitates the unified allocation of labor, the organization of large-scale cooperation and large-scale operations under the principles of mutual assistance and mutual benefit and equivalent exchange; it facilitates the unified allocation of water sources, the implementation of planned water use, the strengthening of irrigation management, and the realization of garden-style farming, etc. Therefore, we must make full use of and give play to the superior conditions of the people's communes, carry out the water conservancy movement this winter and next spring, and plan and organize future water conservancy construction according to the above-mentioned new characteristics, and improve one step on the existing basis.
    2. The mass water conservancy construction movement should continue to implement the policy of focusing on water storage, focusing on community-run projects, focusing on small-scale projects, and combining large, medium and small-scale projects, with overall planning and comprehensive utilization. All localities should have a relatively comprehensive water conservancy plan, pay attention to storing more water and diverting more water, and build a variety of water storage projects according to local conditions to improve drought and flood resistance capabilities. On the basis of the widespread construction of small-scale projects, actively build large and medium-sized backbone projects. Without large-scale water conservancy projects, only small and medium-sized water conservancy projects still cannot cope with extremely large floods and droughts. Large, medium and small projects must be combined to gradually form a complete water conservancy system, and water conservancy resources must be fully developed. This winter and next spring, we must seize the time to improve and upgrade existing engineering facilities, repair channels, and level land to give full play to the benefits of existing projects; on the other hand, we must seize the time to build a number of new projects, and strive to expand the irrigated area, and the newly built projects should also do their best to do the corresponding channel and land consolidation work. In some places where the proportion of irrigated area to farmland is small and the drought resistance capacity is low, it is even more necessary to seize the opportunity this winter to vigorously carry out the water conservancy movement. Water conservancy construction should actively cooperate with the construction of commodity grain bases, so that these bases can realize water conservancy one step ahead.
    3. Make labor arrangements. Water conservancy construction is highly seasonal, and 80% of the tasks for the whole year are concentrated in winter and spring. During this period, more labor should be appropriately arranged to invest in water conservancy construction, and labor organization should be strengthened to improve labor efficiency. When allocating and using labor, we must adhere to the principle of distribution according to labor and equivalent exchange, and must not transfer labor without compensation.
    In construction, strengthen technical guidance, pay attention to project quality, and establish a necessary project inspection and acceptance system. Do practical work, work hard and cleverly, vigorously promote tool reform and technological innovation, gradually realize construction mechanization and semi-mechanization, and carry out the high work efficiency movement. We must also properly arrange the lives of migrant workers and the safety and hygiene work during construction.
    Continue to implement the policy of running water conservancy diligently and thriftily. The state should provide necessary support within its capabilities for the funds and materials needed for small and medium-sized water conservancy projects. However, we still mainly rely on the strength of the masses. The main source of funds is the public accumulation of communes at all levels, and the materials are also mainly solved by taking local materials and using both indigenous and foreign methods.
    The land occupied by small and medium-sized water conservancy projects is generally adjusted and resolved by the county and commune themselves.
    4. "Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture" and is an important measure in the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. Managing and using water well to maximize its benefits is an important issue for all irrigation areas, especially new irrigation areas. We must strengthen the management of various irrigation areas, improve organizations, replenish cadres, actively improve irrigation techniques, promote planned water use and garden-style farming, and give full play to the role of water. We must also immediately start checking and repairing existing water conservancy projects, leveling land, improving the channel system, storing water and conserving water, and matching machine repairs, etc., to prepare for winter irrigation and spring irrigation.
    In the past year or two, the area of soil salinization in some irrigation areas in the north has developed to some extent, and should be given high attention. Take practical and effective measures to prevent the continued expansion of the area of salinization in irrigation areas; those that have already been salinized should be transformed within two or three years.
    5. Launch a winter fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement to obtain sufficient topdressing fertilizer for overwintering crops and prepare sufficient fertilizer for next year's spring-sown crops. All localities should formulate fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production plans according to the fertilizer requirements of next year's production increase plan, mobilize the masses, and quickly launch a fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement. The main source of farm fertilizer is to greatly develop pig raising, and further launch a pig raising upsurge in winter. At the same time, we must actively develop and utilize other fertilizer sources. All localities should also actively develop chemical fertilizer production by adopting small indigenous groups and small foreign groups according to local conditions to increase the quantity of chemical fertilizer. In the south, we should make full use of winter fallow fields to expand the green manure planting area, strengthen the field management of green manure, and increase the yield of green manure. In accumulating and producing fertilizer, do not simply pursue quantity, but pay attention to both quantity and quality, and pay attention to improving quality; we must also do a good job in preserving fertilizer and reduce the loss of fertilizer efficiency. The labor required for fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production should be unified with winter water conservancy, short-distance transportation and other winter sideline production, and do not neglect one thing and lose sight of the other.
    6. Water and soil conservation is a basic measure to develop mountain production, fundamentally control rivers and prevent flood and drought disasters, and must be actively carried out. The Yellow River Basin is the focus of water and soil conservation work, which is extremely important for the protection of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy枢纽 project. The provinces and regions in the basin must seize this winter to vigorously launch a mass water and soil conservation movement. The upstream of other large and medium-sized reservoirs that have been built or are about to be built should also focus on water and soil conservation and治理 as soon as possible. In water and soil conservation work, engineering measures and biological measures must be given equal importance, actively carry out grass planting and afforestation work, and strive to accelerate the realization of the方針 of green mountains, green waters, and terraced fields, and truly basically control water and soil loss.
    7. In pastoral areas lacking water and pastures, actively dig wells, open canals, build reservoirs, intercept undercurrents, etc., to solve the problem of drinking water for people and livestock, and actively develop the irrigation of feed bases. At the same time, pastoral areas should vigorously train water conservancy cadres of ethnic minorities, conduct a general survey of water sources, and formulate water conservancy plans.
    8. The key to carrying out the mass water conservancy movement is to first conscientiously implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely oppose Rightism, boost morale, adhere to political command, and adhere to the mass line. At the same time, conscientiously summarize the experience in water conservancy construction since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, conscientiously推广 all effective and successful experiences, and carry them forward in practice.
    Let us hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, forge ahead courageously, win greater victories in the water conservancy upsurge this winter and next spring, and ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production.

    党中央和国务院发出战斗号召
    大搞“水”“肥”保证明年农业继续大跃进
    水利仍是目前发展农业生产的根本问题。在今后几个冬春，再搞几次水利建设高潮，力争在较短时间内实现水利化。这是全党全民建设社会主义的一项重大任务。　当前形势好得很，对于大兴水利十分有利。在今冬明春继续展开一个大规模的群众性的兴修水利运动，并且比1958年的水利高潮，气势更磅礴、组织更健全、效率更高、质量更好，是完全可能的。各级党委和人委必须充分地认清这个形势，积极地把这一运动领导起来。
    新华社24日讯　中共中央和国务院于10月24日发出关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示，全文如下：
    中共中央　国务院关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示　一九五九年十月二十四日
    今年我国南方和北方一些省份，遭遇严重的洪水袭击，中部广大地区受到特大旱灾的威胁。由于总路线的鼓舞和各级党委的坚强领导，依靠历年特别是大跃进以来兴修的大批水利工程，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，组织了大规模的协作支援和大兵团作战，使我们在防洪抗旱斗争中，取得伟大的胜利。这不仅大大减少了受灾面积和减轻了受灾程度，而且保证了今年农业生产在去年特大丰收的基础上继续跃进。另一方面，我们现有的水利设施虽不算少，但是，在地区上还不平衡，许多工程的抗旱防涝能力还偏低，还有一部分工程质量差或者不成系统，不能充分发挥效益。从今年夏季各地抗旱防涝的情况来看，大部分农业地区还不能在特大旱涝灾害的袭击下保证高产稳收。因此，水利仍是目前发展农业生产的根本问题。在今后几个冬春，再搞几次水利建设高潮，力争在较短时间内实现水利化。这是全党全民建设社会主义的一项重大任务。
    当前形势好的很，对于大兴水利十分有利：总路线光芒万丈；人民公社的优越性越来越显著地发挥出来；工业对农田水利建设将有进一步的支援；各地都有了丰富的群众性的治山治水的成功经验；基层的水利技术力量已经成批地生长起来；今年抗旱防涝斗争的伟大胜利鼓舞了群众改造自然的雄心和壮志；特别是党的八届八中全会以来，反右倾、鼓干劲，粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对水利建设的污蔑和攻击，因而广大群众发展生产的积极性空前高涨。因此，在今冬明春继续展开一个大规模的群众性的兴修水利运动，并且比1958年的水利高潮，气势更磅礴、组织更健全、效率更高、质量更好，是完全可能的。各级党委和人委必须充分地认清这个形势，积极地把这一运动领导起来。
    一、人民公社是水利运动的新基础，给水利运动带来很多新的特点：它便于举办较大的骨干工程，使大中小型水利工程结合起来；它便于把过去分散的孤立的工程联结起来，形成一个比较完整的灌溉排水系统；它便于结合大江大河的治理，进行中小河流全流域的规划和综合开发；它便于在互助互利和等价交换的原则下，统一调配劳力，组织大协作和大兵团作战；它便于统一调配水源，推行计划用水，加强灌溉管理，实现园田化等等。因此，必须充分利用和发挥人民公社的优越条件，开展今冬明春的水利运动，并且根据上述新的特点，规划和组织今后的水利建设，在现有基础上提高一步。
    二、群众性的兴修水利运动要继续贯彻执行以蓄水为主、社办为主、小型为主和大中小型工程相结合的方针，全面规划，综合利用。各地都应当有一个比较全面的水利规划，注意多蓄水、多引水，因地制宜地兴建多种多样的蓄水工程，提高抗旱防涝的能力。在小型工程遍地开花的基础上，积极兴修大、中型骨干工程。只有中小型水利工程，没有大型水利工程，仍然不能对付特大的洪水和旱灾。必须使大、中、小工程结合起来，逐步形成完整的水利系统，并且充分开发水利资源。今冬明春必须一面抓紧改善和提高已有的工程设施，并且整修好渠道，平整好土地，使已有的工程充分发挥效益；另一面抓紧修建一批新工程，力争扩大灌溉面积，而新修的工程也应该尽力做好相应的渠道和整地工作。有些地方灌溉面积占农田的比例较小，抗旱能力较低，更要抓紧今冬的时机，大力开展水利运动。水利建设应该积极配合农产品商品基地的建设，使这些基地先一步实现水利化。
    三、要作好劳力安排。兴修水利季节性很强，全年80％的任务要集中在冬春完成。在这一时期，应该适当地安排较多的劳动力，投入水利建设，并且加强劳动组织，提高劳动效率。在调配和使用劳动力的时候，必须坚持按劳分配和等价交换的原则，不能无偿地大调工。
    在施工中要加强技术指导，重视工程质量，建立必要的工程检查验收制度。实干、苦干加巧干，大闹工具改革和技术革新，逐步实现施工机械化和半机械化，开展高工效运动。还要妥善安排民工生活和施工中的安全卫生工作。
    继续贯彻执行勤俭办水利的方针，中小型水利工程所需要的经费和器材，国家应该在可能范围内给予必要的支援。但是，主要还是依靠群众力量，经费的主要来源是公社各级的公共积累，器材也主要采取就地取材和土洋并举的办法来解决。
    中、小型水利工程占用的土地，一般由县、社自行调剂解决。
    四、“水利是农业的命脉”，是农业八字宪法中的一项重要的措施。把水管好、用好，使它发挥最大的效益，对所有灌区，特别是对新灌区来说是一个重要问题。必须加强各灌区的管理工作，健全组织，充实干部，积极改进灌水技术，推行计划用水和园田化，充分发挥水的作用。还要立即着手检查和修补已有的水利工程，平整土地，健全渠系，蓄水保水和机器修理配套等等工作，为冬灌和春灌作好准备。
    近一、二年来，北方有些灌区土壤盐碱化面积有所发展，应该高度予以重视，采取切实有效的措施，制止灌区盐碱化面积的继续扩大；已经盐碱化的要争取在二、三年内加以改造。
    五、开展冬季积肥、造肥运动，为越冬作物搞到充足的追肥，为明年春种作物准备足够的肥料。各地应该根据明年增产计划对肥料的要求，制订积肥、造肥计划，发动群众，迅速掀起积肥、造肥运动。农家肥料的主要来源是大量发展养猪，在冬季进一步掀起养猪高潮。同时，对其他肥源也要积极开展利用。各地还要根据当地的具体条件，积极采取小土群和小洋群的方法发展化肥生产，增加化肥数量。南方要尽量利用冬闲田扩大绿肥种植面积，加强绿肥的田间管理，提高绿肥产量。积肥、造肥，不要单纯追求数量，要数量质量并重，注意提高质量；还要做好保肥工作，减少肥效流失。积肥、造肥所需要的劳动力要与冬修水利、短途运输和其他各项冬季副业生产统一安排，不要顾此失彼。
    六、水土保持是发展山区生产、根治河流和防御水旱灾害的基本措施，必须积极进行。黄河流域是水土保持工作的重点，对保护三门峡水利枢纽工程有极为重要的意义。流域各省区，必须抓紧今年冬季，大力掀起一个水土保持的群众运动。其他已经建成或即将建成的大、中型水库的上游，也要把水土保持做为重点，尽快治理。在水土保持工作中，工程措施与生物措施必须并重，积极开展种草造林工作，为青山绿水梯田化、真正基本控制水土流失的方针加紧努力。
  七、在牧区缺水草场上，要积极打井、开渠、修水库、截潜流等等，解决人畜饮水问题，积极发展饲料基地的灌溉。同时，牧区要大力培养少数民族的水利干部，普遍查勘水源，制定水利规划。
  八、开展群众水利运动的关键首先是认真贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，坚决反对右倾、鼓足干劲，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线。同时认真地总结1958年大跃进以来水利建设方面的经验，把一切行之有效的成功的经验认真地加以推广，并且在实践中加以发扬。
    让我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，奋勇前进，在今冬明春水利高潮中，夺取更大的胜利，保证农业生产的继续跃进。
