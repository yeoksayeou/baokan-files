Xinhua News Agency, October 26th—Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
October 26, 1959

    On October 20 and 21, 1959, Indian armed personnel invaded the northwest border of China's Tibet region and carried out armed provocations. On October 23, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs made a report to the press on this incident that was inconsistent with the facts and violated the truth. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes it is necessary to publish the full facts in order to set the record straight.
    On October 20, 1959, three Indian armed personnel illegally crossed into Chinese territory in the area south of the Kongka Pass in the northwest end of China's Tibet region. Chinese border guards immediately advised them to withdraw from Chinese territory, but they refused. In order to safeguard the inviolability of the motherland's territory, Chinese border guards had no choice but to disarm them and detain them. On October 21, an Indian army of more than seventy people again invaded Chinese territory in the same area and groundlessly carried out armed provocations against the Chinese border troops patrolling there. Relying on their superior forces, they surrounded and approached the smaller Chinese patrol force in two directions. At 13:09 local time, they first opened fire on the Chinese patrol force. The Chinese patrol force used gestures to ask them to withdraw from Chinese territory and stop shooting. However, the Indian army ignored them and opened fire for the second time at 13:19. The Chinese patrol force once again made gestures to them, but the Indian army still ignored them and continued to advance, snatching horses belonging to the Chinese patrol force that were nearby, and even launched a fierce attack on the Chinese patrol force at 13:27, launching an armed assault. Under these circumstances, the Chinese patrol force had no choice but to retaliate in self-defense. In the conflict, which lasted about two hours, both sides suffered casualties, and seven Indian soldiers were captured by the Chinese patrol force. The Indian army withdrew from Chinese territory at approximately 16:00 local time, and Chinese border troops found nine Indian army corpses at the scene.
    After the Chinese government received the report on this incident, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately delivered a memorandum to Mr. Parthasarathi, the Indian Ambassador to China, on October 22, lodging a serious protest and demanding that the Indian government immediately take measures to stop Indian troops from invading the Chinese border and provoking Chinese border troops from happening again. However, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs delivered a note and issued a statement to the Chinese Embassy in India on October 23, distorting the true course of the aforementioned incident, accusing the Chinese troops of invading Indian territory and provoking armed conflict, attempting to push all responsibility for the incident onto the Chinese side. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered another note to the Indian Ambassador to China on October 24, refuting the Indian government's unfounded accusations against China, resolutely rejecting the protest raised by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in its note of October 23, and reiterating the serious protest and demands put forward by the Chinese government in its memorandum of October 22.
    The location where this incident occurred was within Chinese territory, which is indisputable. However, in its note of October 23, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, based on the one-sided and untrue drawing of the Sino-Indian border on Indian official maps, claimed that the site of the conflict was about forty to fifty miles west of the traditional Sino-Indian border, and also claimed that Indian police forces had been patrolling this entire area in the past without encountering obstacles, and that Chinese troops had only entered this area in recent months. The Chinese government cannot agree with this statement, which is inconsistent with the facts and violates the truth.
    The customary border line between China and Ladakh, formed by historical tradition, in fact, has always extended southeast through the Karakoram Pass, passed through the Kongka Pass, turned southwest, and then traveled south across the western part of Pangong Lake. The entire area east of this line has always been under Chinese administrative jurisdiction. Chinese-published maps accurately mark this section of the border based on historical tradition and Chinese administrative jurisdiction. Premier Zhou Enlai clearly explained this section of the border in his letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8. However, according to the way the border is drawn on Indian-published maps, large areas of Chinese territory have been incorporated into Ladakh. The Indian government says that the legal basis for this drawing is the treaty signed in 1842 between the Chinese Tibet local authorities and the Kashmir authorities. In fact, the 1842 treaty did not specifically define or explain the location of this border. For a long period of time, Indian officially published maps did not depict this section of the border, or marked this section of the border as an undefined boundary. In recent years, this section of the border suddenly appeared on Indian officially published maps, its location not only extending deep into Chinese territory, but also marked as a defined boundary. However, this one-sided drawing cannot change the fact that the large area of land incorporated into Ladakh on Indian maps has never been under Indian administrative jurisdiction. Therefore, as Premier Zhou Enlai said in his letter of September 8, the way the border is drawn on Indian maps is neither legally based nor consistent with the actual situation of the long-standing administrative jurisdiction of both sides.
    The entire area east of the traditional customary line between China and Ladakh, including the area east, south, and north of Kongka Pass, has always been Chinese territory and under the jurisdiction of China's Xinjiang and Tibet regions. Since the liberation of Xinjiang and Tibet, the border troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been stationed and patrolling throughout this area. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, built by China from 1956 to 1957, passes through this area. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also admitted in its note of October 23 that the Indian government has no troops in this area, but said that Indian police forces have been patrolling this entire area in the past without encountering obstacles. If this statement is consistent with the facts, how can it be imagined that China could build a highway through this area and use this highway smoothly to this day? In September 1958 and July 1959, some individual Indian armed personnel did come to this area, but they were illegally crossing the border and were immediately disarmed and detained by Chinese border troops. These Indian armed personnel were later deported and their weapons were returned. The Chinese government has expressed regret and protested to the Indian government separately regarding these two illegal border crossings.
    The facts are very clear that, according to the traditional customary line between China and Ladakh and China's jurisdiction over the area east of this border, the events of October 20 and 21 were entirely caused by the illegal intrusion of Indian armed personnel into Chinese territory and armed provocations. It is unreasonable to attempt to push the responsibility for this incident onto China.
    The Chinese government cannot but regret to point out that this incident is the second border armed conflict provoked by the Indian side in the past two months. Just as in the armed conflict in the Majitan area on August 25, the Chinese border troops once again exhausted all means to avoid armed conflict, and only when it was absolutely necessary, retaliated in self-defense. Both armed conflicts have resulted in casualties on both sides, which is extremely unfortunate, but the rights and wrongs and responsibilities of these two incidents must be clear and unambiguous, and national feelings should not be stirred up or the situation escalated because of the casualties. It is true that in both incidents, the Chinese side suffered fewer casualties, which precisely proves that the Chinese side was in a defensive position in both cases. Anyone with a little military common sense understands that the attacking side generally suffers more casualties than the defending side. It is surprising that the Indian side, after provoking the recent armed conflict incident, has expressed its right to demand full compensation from the Chinese government. If the issue of compensation is mentioned, then only the Chinese side, not the Indian side, has the right to make such a demand.
    In order to maintain peace and tranquility on the border between China and India and to safeguard the friendship between the two countries, the Chinese government has always advocated that the two countries should, based on the Five Principles, comprehensively and reasonably resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations in a prepared and step-by-step manner. Prior to this, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the long-existing status quo of the border, and should not change this status quo through unilateral actions, let alone use force. The Chinese government has always done this. Although the Indian government has also repeatedly expressed its agreement that both sides should maintain the long-existing status quo of the border, in fact, India has undermined this status quo in many places in the western and eastern sectors of the Sino-Indian border, occupied many places that have always belonged to China, and has not withdrawn them despite repeated requests from the Chinese government. If it is said that Indian troops can arbitrarily cross the traditional customary border line between China and India in the west, intrude into Chinese territory, and conduct so-called patrols, then Chinese troops have even more reason to conduct patrols in the area south of the so-called McMahon Line in the east. This is not only because the so-called McMahon Line is illegal, but also because the area south of this line was indeed under Chinese administrative jurisdiction not long ago, and the Chinese Tibet local government was still collecting taxes there until 1951. However, although the Chinese government absolutely cannot recognize this illegal boundary line, Chinese border troops have never crossed the so-called McMahon Line. This is in order to maintain harmony on the border and to facilitate the negotiation and resolution of the border issue. In recent times, the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its desire to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue peacefully and through friendly consultations, and has made unremitting efforts to improve the once-turbulent Sino-Indian relations. Under such circumstances, the Indian side has once again provoked an armed conflict incident, which cannot but cause deep regret to the Chinese government. However, the Chinese government's desire to peacefully resolve the Sino-Indian border issue will not change, and the Chinese government will not relax its efforts to improve and strengthen Sino-Indian friendly relations. Out of consideration for the traditional friendship between China and India and humanitarianism, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already notified the Indian government in its note of October 24 that the Chinese government is prepared to release the ten Indian military personnel captured in the incidents of October 20 and 21. The nine Indian army corpses have also been properly buried and are ready for the Indian side to retrieve at any time. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Indian government will also prioritize the friendship between the two countries, immediately take measures to stop Indian troops from invading the Chinese border and provoking again, prevent any further statements and actions that damage the relations between the two countries, and enable the border issue between the two countries to be resolved fairly and reasonably in a good atmosphere and along the correct path.

    公布印军越境武装挑衅的真相，驳斥印方无理指控
    希望印度政府以中印友谊为重，保持两国边界安宁
    新华社26日讯　中华人民共和国外交部声明
                                    1959年10月26日
    1959年10月20日和21日，印度武装人员侵犯中国西藏地方的西北边境并且进行武装挑衅。10月23日印度外交部对这次事件向报界作了不符事实和违反真理的报道。中国外交部认为有必要发表全部事实真相，以正视听。
    1959年10月20日，有印度武装人员三人在中国西藏地方西北端的空喀山口以南地区，非法越入了我国领土。中国边防人员当即劝告他们立即退出中国国境，但是为他们所拒绝。中国边防人员为了维护祖国领土不被侵犯，不得不将他们解除武装，予以扣押。10月21日，一支七十余人的印度军队又在同一处地方侵入中国境内，并且无端地向在该地巡逻的中国边防部队进行武装挑衅。他们仗恃优势的兵力，分两路包围和逼近人数较少的中国巡逻部队。在当地时间十三时九分的时候，他们第一次向中国巡逻部队开枪射击。中国巡逻部队用手势要他们退出中国国境和停止射击。但是，印度军队不理，又在十三时十九分第二次开枪射击。中国巡逻部队再一次向他们作出手势，印度军队仍不理会，反而继续进逼，抢走中国巡逻部队放在附近的马匹，甚至在十三时二十七分向中国巡逻部队猛烈开火，发起武装攻击。在这种情况下，中国巡逻部队为了自卫，不得不进行还击。在约两小时的冲突中，双方各有伤亡，有七名印军被中国巡逻部队俘获。印度军队在当地时间十六时左右撤出了中国国境，中国边防部队在现场发现九具印军尸体。
    在中国政府接到关于这次事件的报告以后，中国外交部立即在10月22日向印度驻华大使帕塔萨拉蒂先生递交备忘录，提出严重抗议，要求印度政府立即采取措施，制止印度军队侵犯中国边境和向中国边防部队挑衅的事件的再次发生。但是，印度外交部却在10月23日先后向中国驻印度大使馆递交照会和发表声明，歪曲上述事件的真实经过，反噬中国部队侵犯印度领土和挑起武装冲突，企图把发生事件的责任全部推在中国方面。中国外交部在10月24日再次向印度驻华大使递交照会，驳斥印度政府对中国的毫无根据的指控，断然拒绝印度外交部在10月23日照会中提出的抗议，并且重申中国政府在10月22日的备忘录中所提出的严重抗议和要求。
    这次事件发生的地点是在中国境内，这本来是无可争辩的。但是，印度外交部在10月23日的照会中，却根据印度官方地图对中印边界的片面和不真实的画法，把冲突地点说成是在中印传统边界以西大约四十到五十英里，还说印度警察部队过去一直在这整个地区巡逻，没有遇到阻碍，而中国军队是在最近几个月中才进入这个地区。这种不符事实、违反真理的说法，中国政府完全不能同意。
    由历史传统所形成的中国和拉达克之间的习惯边界线，事实上一直是通过喀喇昆仑山口以后向东南延伸，穿过空喀山口，折向西南，再南行穿越班公湖的西部。这条线以东的整个地区历来都在中国的行政管辖之下。中国出版的地图正是根据历史传统和中国行政管辖的情况标明这段边界的。周恩来总理在9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的信中对于这段边界曾经作了清楚的说明。但是，根据印度出版的地图对这段边界的画法，大片中国领土却被划入拉达克境内。印度政府说，这种画法的法律根据是1842年中国的西藏地方当局和克什米尔当局签订的和约。事实上，1842年的条约根本没有具体规定和说明这段边界的位置。印度官方出版的地图，在一个很长的时期内，没有画出这段边界，或者标明这段边界是未定界。到了最近几年，在印度官方出版的地图上突然出现了这段边界，它的位置不仅深入到中国境内，而且被标明为已定界。但是，这种片面的画法无法改变这样一个事实，那就是在印度地图上被划入拉达克境内的大片土地，从来没有在印度的行政管辖之下。因此，正如周恩来总理在9月8日的信中所说，印度的地图对这段边界的画法是既无法律根据、又不符合双方历来行政管辖的实际情况的。
    中国和拉达克之间的传统习惯线以东的整个地区，包括空喀山口以东、以南和以北的地方，从来就是中国的领土，分属中国新疆地方和西藏地方管辖。从新疆和西藏解放以来，中国人民解放军的边防部队就一直在这整个地区驻守和巡逻。1956年到1957年中国修筑的新藏公路就通过这个地区。印度外交部在10月23日的照会中也承认印度政府在这个地区没有军队，但是，却说印度的警察部队过去一直在这整个地区巡逻，没有遇到阻碍。如果这种说法是符合事实的话，怎么能够设想中国可以通过这个地区修筑公路，并且至今畅通无阻地使用这条公路呢？在1958年9月和1959年7月，的确有个别印度武装人员来到过这个地区，但是，那是非法越境的，因此立即被中国边防部队解除武装和扣押。这些印度武装人员后来被递解出境，并且发还了他们的武器。对于这两次非法越境事件，中国政府都曾经向印度政府分别表示遗憾和提出抗议。
    事实很清楚，根据中国和拉达克之间的传统习惯线和中国对这段边界以东地区的管辖情况，10月20日和21日的事件完全是由于印度武装人员非法侵入中国境内和进行武装挑衅所引起的。企图把这次事件的责任推到中国身上是毫无道理的。
    中国政府不能不遗憾地指出，这次事件已经是最近两个月内印度方面所挑起的第二次边境武装冲突。正像8月25日在马及墩地区发生的武装冲突事件中一样，中国边防部队又一次用尽一切办法力求避免武装冲突，只是到了迫不得已的时候，为了自卫，才进行还击。两次武装冲突都造成了双方的伤亡，这是极不幸的，但是，这两次事件的是非和责任所在，必须分明而不容模糊，更不应该因为遭受伤亡而煽动民族感情，扩大事态。不错，在两次事件中，中国方面的伤亡都比较少，这恰好证明中国方面两次都处于防御地位。只要有一点军事常识的人都懂得，进攻的方面一般地说，总是比防御方面遭受更多的伤亡。印度方面挑起了最近这次武装冲突事件以后，竟然表示保留要求中国政府给予充分赔偿的权利，这是令人惊异的。如果提到赔偿的问题，那么，只有中国方面而不是印度方面才有权提出这种要求。
    为了保持中印两国边界的安宁和维护两国的友谊，中国政府一直主张两国根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面地合理地解决两国边界问题。在此以前，作为临时性措施，双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动，更不应该使用武力来改变这种状况。中国政府一直是这样做的。虽然印度政府也多次表示同意双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，但是实际上，印度却在中印边界的西段和东段的许多地方破坏了这种状况，侵占了一向属于中国的许多地方，而且不顾中国政府的多次要求，至今没有撤出。如果说，印度军队可以任意越过西面的中印传统的习惯边界线，侵入中国境内，进行所谓巡逻，那么，中国军队就更有理由在东面到所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区进行巡逻。这不仅因为所谓麦克马洪线是非法的，而且因为这条线以南的地区的确在不久以前还在中国的行政管辖之下，中国西藏地方政府直到1951年还在那里收税。但是，尽管中国政府绝对不能承认这条非法的界线，中国边防部队从来没有越过所谓麦克马洪线。这是为了维持边界的和睦，以利于边界问题的谈判和解决。最近一个时期，中国政府一再表示通过和平友好的协商、合理解决中印边界问题的愿望，并且作出不懈的努力，使一度发生波折的中印关系得到改善。在这样的情况下，印度方面又一次挑起武装冲突事件，不能不使中国政府感到深切的遗憾。但是，中国政府和平解决中印边界问题的愿望是不会改变的，中国政府也不会放松改善和加强中印友好关系的努力。从中印的传统友谊和人道主义的考虑出发，中国外交部已经在10月24日的照会中通知印度政府，中国政府准备释放在10月20日和21日事件中被俘获的十名印军人员，九名印军尸体，也已妥为掩埋，随时准备印度方面领回。中国政府衷心地希望，印度政府也同样以两国友谊为重，立即采取措施制止印度军队再次侵入中国边境和进行挑衅，防止任何进一步损害两国关系的言论和行动，使两国边界问题能够在良好的气氛下，沿着正确的途径得到公平合理的解决。
