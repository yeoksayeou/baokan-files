Xinhua News Agency, 20th - A modern Beijing Bearing Factory officially began construction in the eastern suburbs of Beijing today.

　　The factory has a planned total construction area of 225,000 square meters and will build eighteen workshops, including grinding, turning, steel ball, retainer, large bearing, and precision bearing workshops. Once completed, it will be able to produce 10 million sets of various bearings annually. Among them, about 20% are precision bearings and large bearings; about 80% are ordinary bearings, used for assembling automobiles and tractors, which is of great significance for promoting the mechanization of agriculture.

　　This modern factory is designed by our own country. The factory building will also be equipped with the most advanced equipment made in our country. These equipments can manufacture more than 300 different models of ordinary bearings and precision bearings. According to the original plan, the main factory building was scheduled to start construction next year. In order to meet the needs of national agricultural mechanization, it is now decided to start construction ahead of schedule. The construction, design departments, and construction unit workers who heard the news are determined to launch a mass rapid construction movement, striving to put it into production next year. This factory will be built using industrialized construction methods, and thousands of workers are currently working on the site.

    北京兴建现代化轴承厂
    新华社20日讯　现代化的北京轴承厂今天在北京东郊正式开始动工兴建。
    这座工厂的计划建筑总面积为二十二万五千平方米，要建设磨工、车工、钢球、保持器、大型轴承、精密轴承等十八个车间。全部建成以后，每年可以生产各种轴承一千万套。其中，有20％左右是精密轴承和大型轴承；有80％左右是普通轴承，作为装配汽车、拖拉机之用，对促进农业机械化运动，有着重要的意义。
    这座现代化的工厂是我国自己设计的。厂房内还将安装我国自制的最先进的设备。这些设备能够制造三百多种不同型号的普通轴承和精密轴承。按照原计划，这座工厂的主要厂房准备在明年动工兴建。为了适应全国农业机械化的需要，现在决定提前动工。兴建这座厂房的施工、设计部门和建设单位的职工听到这个消息，决心要大搞群众性的快速施工运动，争取明年投入生产。这个工厂将采用工业化施工方法进行兴建，现在有上千名工人正在工地施工。
