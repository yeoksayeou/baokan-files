Strengthening the Collusion of Japanese and American Monopoly Capital
By Japanese Economist, Toyoda Shiro

I.

　　Currently, people say that Japan's "post-war period" has ended from various perspectives. This primarily means that the Japanese economy, dominated by domestic and foreign monopoly capital, has broken free from the "post-war period" state and has restarted to implement blatant reactionary domestic and foreign policies. Of course, this doesn't mean that the inherent contradictions of Japanese capitalism have been resolved or have disappeared, nor does it mean that the basic contradictions formed during the "post-war period" under American imperialism, such as the contradictions between the Japanese nation and American imperialism, and between Japanese monopoly capital and American monopoly capital, have been resolved. These contradictions still exist and are developing.

　　The Japanese economy has now entered a so-called "new stage of Japan-U.S. economic cooperation." Through the "post-war period" up to now, Japanese monopoly capital has, on one hand, deepened its subordination to American monopoly capital to varying degrees, and on the other hand, relied on the assistance of American monopoly capital and the support of the reactionary domestic government to accelerate the consolidation of the foundation of monopoly enterprises and implement industrial "modernization." However, this "modernized" industrial enterprise, due to its dependence on the U.S. and the particular deepening of the overall crisis of post-war capitalism, still retains the characteristic of the Japanese economy's "shallow foundation" which has been inherited from before the war. Japanese monopoly capital attempts to revive militarism in the process of deepening its dependence on the U.S., in order to relive the "old dream," and to use this as a direction to get rid of the "shallow foundation" status quo. This is the basic characteristic of the economic collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital.

　　Today, under the new Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation" system, Japanese monopoly capital, under the protection of the American Stars and Stripes, is attempting to expand into Southeast Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Middle East. Of course, the new collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital is a "marriage of convenience" with many contradictions and conflicts between them, which cannot be ignored. Obviously, the new system of "economic cooperation" they have established will first sacrifice the Japanese working people and the people of underdeveloped countries such as Southeast Asia.

II.

　　An influential figure in the Japanese financial world expressed the following views in the June 15th issue of "The Economist" magazine, which confirms the above argument. He pointed out: (1) After fourteen years since the war, the restoration process of the Japanese economy has been completed, and capital accumulation has also been strengthened. The industrial structure has changed with new-type heavy electrical machinery and the steel industry replacing the old-type textile industry and chemical industry, and American-style management methods have been absorbed. This has brought about the result of economic "modernization." (2) Now, driven by the world's technological innovation, various industrial sectors are carrying out technological innovation centering on new industries such as heavy electrical machinery, electrical, petrochemical, and atomic energy, and are using this to realize the reorganization of enterprise sectors. It is incorrect to measure the mainstream of today's financial world solely with the concept of the old-style "Zaibatsu Group." In particular, the atomic energy group composed of companies such as Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company and Hitachi, Ltd. is at the forefront as the "mainstream faction" of the financial world. (3) The international environment has also undergone new changes. The rapid economic development of the Soviet Union and China, the free exchange of currencies in Western European countries, and the establishment of the Common Market have intensified international market competition. Moreover, the United States' desire for foreign investment has recently increased significantly. In order to promote the "liberalization" of the economy, Japan must further strengthen its cooperation with the United States in capital and technology externally, and incorporate small and medium-sized enterprises into the new enterprise system internally. (4) Due to changes in the industrial structure and "economic modernization," the voice of financial figures has also begun to undergo significant changes. At the meetings of the Federation of Economic Organizations, the voice of heavy electrical machinery and the steel industry has been strengthened, while the representatives of the coal industry, etc., have lost their voice.

　　The general meeting of the Federation of Economic Organizations held on May 28 this year adopted a policy based on the above-mentioned viewpoints. In particular, the resolution stated: "Creating an economic 'constitution' sufficient to cope with the intensifying situation of international economic competition is the current task."

　　For this reason, the following requests were made to the government: (1) In order to realize the liberalization of exchange rates, fundamentally revise the "Exchange Control Law," "Anti-Monopoly Law," and "Import and Export Trade Law"; (2) In order to promote the enrichment of enterprise capital, revise the tax system starting with lowering the corporate tax; (3) Handle the input of new technologies and foreign capital flexibly. These demands from the financial world simply aim to improve international competitiveness by relying on various measures to reduce production costs, and to freely open the door to foreign capital (actually American capital) in order to strengthen the relationship of "Japan-U.S. economic cooperation." In fact, the Kishi Nobusuke government has already determined a policy of facilitating the import of foreign capital within the scope of the Foreign Capital Law, and is preparing to revise the "Exchange Control Law," "Anti-Monopoly Law," and other laws in order to implement free currency exchange.

　　Not only that, Japan has absorbed a large amount of foreign investment and imported foreign technology since this year. For example, on May 1 this year, Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company concluded a contract for the contracted processing of semiconductor products with the American International General Electric Company that was a step further than the previous absorption of shares and import of technology (the first order was approximately 800 million yen), affixed the trademark of International General Electric Company to its products, and sold them on the world market. Regarding the production of electronic computers, the company is preparing to open a joint venture with Remington Rand, but is hindered by the Foreign Capital Law, which protects domestic machinery. Oki Electric Company has concluded a contract for the contracted processing of card-punching machines with International Business Machines. This kind of activity has occurred in the sewing machine industry and the pharmaceutical industry in the past, but it is the first time that monopoly enterprises producing heavy electrical machinery, communication machinery, ball bearing insulation materials, and aluminum manufacturing have become contractors for American monopoly enterprises.

　　In addition, first-class electrical companies such as American RSE, Motorola, Dennis Company, and Admiral Radio Company are strengthening cooperation with relevant Japanese enterprises. This is because the US government, in order to effectively concentrate the power of domestic electrical industry capital to produce highly sophisticated missile weapons (a "Sidewinder" missile requires two thousand semiconductors), cannot take care of civilian electrical production, and coupled with inflation and high production costs, the competitiveness of exports is weak. Therefore, it attempts to use Japan's cheap labor and technical strength to compete with Britain and West Germany in the international market. For example, the production cost of a semiconductor is $1.80 in the United States, but only $0.80 in Japan. The US government also used state funds in May of this year to issue a large number of "special procurement" orders to Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation and New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (17,911 vehicles, totaling $48.3 million, equivalent to Japan's annual production of trucks, including additional orders, equal to twice the amount of "special procurement" orders during the Korean War). This is a link in strengthening Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation."

　　At the same time, the Defense Production Committee of the Federation of Economic Organizations and the "Arms Industry Association" are currently eager to contract American weapons production while domesticizing missile weapons. On March 5 this year, the Far East Branch of the American "Arms Industry Association" and the Japanese "Arms Industry Association" held a joint meeting. At the meeting, the Japanese side requested the early realization of the "Uemura (Kogoro) Plan." According to this plan, Japan purchases weapons from the United States with yen, and the United States uses this yen payment to purchase weapons from Japan and supply them to Southeast Asia. In addition, Japan's more than one billion U.S. dollars in war reparations and additional loans to Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Vietnam can also be regarded as disguised Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation."

III.

　　Up to June of this year, the total amount of foreign capital imported that was approved under the "Foreign Capital Law" was $676 million, and the imported technology (statistics at the end of 1958, calculated at an annual interest rate of 5%) was 807 items, $827.788 million, totaling approximately $1.4 billion. The vast majority of this $1.4 billion is American capital. Among them, American capital "participating in management" is mainly in the oil and electrical sectors, while "technical cooperation" is centered on electrical, textile, chemical, and transportation machinery, and almost affects the entire industrial sector. In addition, there are loans. Loans from the World Bank absorbed through the Development Bank totaled eighteen items by the end of last year, totaling $248.9 million.

　　The "modernization" of Japanese industry after the war has been carried out with great dependence on the United States. Therefore, a large amount of machinery and equipment relies on imports. For example, 20% to 25% of machine tools have relied on imports in recent years.

　　Of course, Japan's dependence on the United States is by no means carried out only through the above-mentioned aspects. Since American imperialism occupied Japan for fourteen years, all important links in Japan's political, military, and economic spheres have been completely controlled by the United States. The United States first disbanded Japan's old army and placed government agencies, police, courts, and major transportation agencies under direct control; then, it dissolved the old Zaibatsu, directly managed and controlled the military industry and important machinery industries, and used the assistance of the "Government Account for Relief in Occupied Areas" and the "Government and Relief in Occupied Areas" and the "Economic Rehabilitation in Occupied Areas" and the "Yen Counterpart Fund" (300 billion yen) to gradually intervene in various important industrial sectors, and made the enterprises of the old Zaibatsu and large capitalists subordinate to American monopoly capital to varying degrees. Although the old Zaibatsu (monopoly capital) were broken up into pieces and dispersed into several groups, some of them colluded with American monopoly capital to form one of the mainstreams of the financial world. Another part of monopoly capital (such as Hitachi, Ltd. and Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company) has gradually consolidated its technological and financial foundation in "cooperation" with American monopoly capital for fourteen years or even earlier.

　　Since the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the "economic cooperation" between Japanese and American monopoly capital has been strengthened year by year, and the traitorous acts of the Japanese monopoly capital group have become more and more serious. Of course, in this regard, the opposition between monopoly capital and small and medium-sized capital is deepening, and there are also differences of opinion between monopoly capital and its political spokespersons on the degree and method of "cooperation." Especially today, when the struggle of the people across the country against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is surging, these contradictions and oppositions will inevitably intensify. The new stage of Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation" is essentially a new stage in which Japanese monopoly capital further depends on the United States and the economic interests of the Japanese nation are further deprived. Broad Japanese public opinion, including some insightful capitalists who demand national economic independence, is deeply disturbed. While struggling against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Japanese people are striving to get rid of the political and economic oppression of the United States.

　　日美垄断资本加强勾结
　　日本经济学家　丰田四郎
　　一
　　现在，人们从各种不同的角度出发，说日本的“战后时期”已经结束。而这首先意味着，处于国内外垄断资本支配下的日本经济已经摆脱了“战后时期”的状态，重新开始执行露骨的对内和对外的反动政策。当然，这决不是说日本资本主义内在的各种矛盾已经解决或消失，也不意味着“战后时期”在美帝国主义占领下形成的基本矛盾，如日本民族和美帝国主义之间、日本垄断资本和美国垄断资本之间的各种矛盾的解决。这些矛盾依然存在和发展着。
    目前日本经济已经进入了一个所谓“日美经济合作新阶段”。日本垄断资本通过迄今为止的“战后时期”，一面程度不同地加深对美国垄断资本的从属关系，一面又依靠美国垄断资本的援助和本国反动政府的扶植，加紧巩固垄断企业的基础和实行产业的“现代化”。但是，这种“现代化”的工业企业，由于对美从属和战后资本主义总危机的特别深化，从战前一直继承下来的日本经济“根底浅薄”这一特点仍未消失。日本垄断资本企图在加深对美从属的过程中复活军国主义，以重温“旧梦”，并且以此作为摆脱“根底浅薄”现状的方向。这就是日美垄断资本在经济上进行勾结的基本特征。
    今天，在新的日美“经济合作”体制下，日本垄断资本在美国星条旗的庇护下，企图向东南亚、中南美、非洲和中近东各国实行扩张。当然，日美垄断资本的新勾结是“同床异梦”，它们之间的矛盾和对立是很多的，这一点不能忽视。显然，它们之间确立的这种“经济合作”新体制，首先遭受牺牲的是日本劳动人民和东南亚等各不发达国家的人民。
　　二
    日本财政界的一个有影响的人物，在今年6月15日“经济学人”杂志上发表如下的看法，证实了上面的论点。他指出：（1）经过战后十四年，日本经济的恢复过程已经完结，资本积累也加强了。以新型的重型电机，钢铁工业为中心代替了旧型的纺织工业和化学工业，使产业结构发生变化，并且吸收了美式的经营管理方法。这样做带来了经济“现代化”的结果。（2）现在，在世界技术革新的推动下，以重型电机、电气、石油化学和原子能等新型产业为中心，各产业部门正在开展技术革新，并借此实现企业部门的重新组合。仅仅以旧式“财阀集团”的观念来衡量今天财政金融界的主流是不正确的。尤其是东京芝浦电气公司、日立制作所等组成原子能集团，作为财政金融界的“主流派”而走在最前面。（3）国际环境也发生了新的变化，苏中等国的经济飞速发展、西欧各国通货实行自由兑换，以及共同市场的成立等等，使国际市场竞争也激化起来。而且，最近美国对外投资欲特别增强了。日本为了推行经济的“自由化”，必须对外进一步在资本和技术方面加强同美国的合作，对内将中小企业纳入新的企业系统。（4）由于产业结构的变化和“经济现代化”，财政金融界人士的发言权也开始有了重大的变化。在经济团体联合会的会议上，重型电机、钢铁工业的发言权加强了，而煤炭工业的代表等等则丧失了发言权。
    今年5月28日召开的经济团体联合会总会，通过了以上述观点为基础的方针，特别是在决议中说：“造成足以应付国际经济竞争激化形势的经济‘体质’是当前的任务。”
    为此，对政府提出以下的要求：（1）为了实现汇兑的自由化，从根本上修改“汇兑管理法”、“禁止垄断法”和“进出口贸易法”；（2）为了促进企业资本的充实，从降低法人税开始修改税制；（3）灵活地处理输入新技术和外国资本的问题。财政金融界的这些要求，简单说来不外是依靠降低生产费用的各种措施来提高国际竞争能力，并向外国资本（实际上是美国资本）自由开放门户，借以加强“日美经济合作”的关系。事实上，岸信介政府已经确定了在外国资本取缔法的范围内便于输入外国资本的方针，并且正在为实行货币自由兑换而准备修改“汇兑管理法”、“禁止垄断法”等法案。
    不仅如此，日本从今年以来已经吸收了大量的外国投资，输入了外国技术。例如，东京芝浦电气公司今年5月1日同美国国际通用电气公司之间比过去吸收股份和输入技术又进了一步，缔结了半导体制品的承制加工合同（第一次订货约为八亿日元），在该公司的产品上面贴上国际通用电气公司的商标，到世界市场上出售。有关电子计算机的生产，该公司准备同雷明顿兰德公司开办一个合股公司，但是为保护国产机械的外资取缔法所阻碍。冲电气公司同国际商用机器公司之间缔结了卡片穿孔用机器的承制加工合同。过去在缝纫机工业和制药工业中有过这种活动，但是生产重型电机、通讯机械、滚珠轴承绝缘材料和制铝等垄断企业成为美国垄断企业的承包企业还是第一次。
    此外，美国的亚尔西爱无线电公司、莫托罗拉公司、丹尼斯公司和艾德米拉尔无线电公司等第一流的电机公司正在加强同日本有关企业的合作。这是因为美国政府为了有效地集中国内的电机业资本的力量来生产高度精密的导弹武器（一个“响尾蛇式”导弹需要二千个半导体），民用电机生产照顾不到，加之通货膨胀，生产成本高，输出的竞争能力弱，因而企图借助日本的廉价劳动和技术力量来同英国、西德在国际市场上对抗。例如，一个半导体的生产费用，美国是一点八美元，日本只有零点八美元。美国政府还动用国家资金在今年5月向日本的丰田汽车公司、新三菱重工业公司发出大批的“特需”订货（一万七千九百一十一辆汽车，总值四千八百三十万美元，相当于日本一年生产的卡车，连追加订货计算在内等于侵朝战争期间“特需”订货的二倍）。这是加强日美“经济合作”的一个环节。
    与此同时，经济团体联合会防卫生产委员会和“军火工业会”，目前在导弹武器的国产化的同时，急于承包美国的武器生产。今年3月5日，美国“军火工业会”远东分会和日本“军火工业会”举行了联席会议。在会上，日本方面要求早日实现“植村（甲午郎）方案”。根据这个方案，日本以日元从美国购买武器，美国以这笔日元货款再从日本购买武器供给东南亚。此外，日本对缅甸、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、南越的十亿多美元的战争赔偿和附加的贷款，也可以看做是变相的日美“经济合作”。
    三
    到今年6月为止，根据“外资取缔法”认可而输入外国资本的总额是六亿七千六百万美元，输入技术（1958年底的统计，按年利5％折算）八百零七件、八亿二千七百八十八万美元，合计约为十四亿美元。这十四亿美元中绝大多数是美国资本，其中美国资本“参加经营”的主要是石油和电机部门，而“技术合作”则以电机、纺织、化学、运输机器等为中心，几乎波及整个产业部门。此外，还有借款。经开发银行吸收的世界银行贷款到去年年底为止计十八项，合计二亿四千八百九十万美元。
    战后日本产业的“现代化”是在大大依附美国的情况下进行的。因此，机器设备大量地依靠进口。如工作母机近几年来一直有20％至25％依靠进口。
    当然，日本经济对美国的从属关系决不仅仅是通过以上各个方面进行的。自从美帝国主义占领日本十四年以来，日本的政治、军事、经济的各个重要环节都完全被美国控制。美国先是解散日本的旧军队，把政府机构、警察、裁判所以及主要的交通机关置于直接的控制之下；接着解散旧财阀，直接管理和控制军需工业和重要机器工业等，并且运用“占领地区行政及救济计划基金”和“占领地区经济复兴基金”的援助和“日元对等资金”（三千亿日元）逐渐染指各重要产业部门，并且使旧财阀、大资本家的企业程度不同地从属于美国垄断资本。旧财阀（垄断资本）虽然化整为零，分散为几个集团，但其中有一部分同美国垄断资本勾结在一起，形成财政金融界的主流之一。另外一部分垄断资本（如日立制作所、东京芝浦电气公司），十四年来或是从更早的时候在同美国垄断资本的“合作”中，逐渐地巩固了技术和资金的基础。
    自从日美“安全条约”签订后，日美垄断资本的“经济合作”逐年加强，日本垄断资本集团的卖国行为变本加厉。当然，在这方面垄断资本同中小资本的对立在加深，而垄断资本和它的政治代言人之间在“合作”的程度和作法上也有意见分歧。尤其是今天当全国人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争高涨中，这些矛盾和对立也就必然会激化起来。日美“经济合作”的新阶段，实质上乃是日本垄断资本进一步依附美国、日本民族经济利益进一步遭到剥夺的新阶段。包括一部分要求民族经济自立的有见识的资本家在内的广大日本舆论，都莫不感到深深的不安。日本人民群众在为反对修改日美“安全条约”而斗争的同时，努力争取摆脱美国的政治、经济压迫而奋斗。
