　　Friendship Window

　　We Welcome Additional New Tasks
　　Some Chinese poets and writers who have visited Bulgaria always meaningfully describe the profound brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people as blossoming flowers. This metaphor could not be more appropriate. Throughout the cities and villages of Bulgaria, the heartwarming fragrance emitted by this flower is everywhere.

　　"Obligations That Must Be Fulfilled"
　　In recent years, Bulgaria has manufactured diesel locomotives, electric motors, transformers, water pumps, and other machinery for our country, providing significant support for China's socialist construction. Recently, we visited the Sofia Metal Cutting Machine Tool Factory. In the factory's assembly workshop, many exquisite and beautiful "C-9" type lathes were displayed. The lathes were also covered with transparent nylon cloth covers. "These are all made for China, a total of forty units..." two young workers enthusiastically introduced to us.

　　Before the visit to the workshop, the factory director, Mr. Chulakov, told us that this year the factory accepted an order to manufacture thirty "C-9" type lathes for China. After the factory's production plan was determined, they suddenly received instructions to add ten more units, totaling forty. Adding ten "C-9" type lathes was a rather difficult task. However, when the workers discussed this task, they unanimously expressed their willingness to accept it and guaranteed to ship the forty lathes to our country before the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

　　In the workshop, we tightly grasped the hands of the workers, thanking them for their brotherly support for our country's socialist construction. What we heard was always this answer: "This is our obligation that must be fulfilled."

　　Learning from Each Other's Strengths Bears Fruitful Results
　　Chinese ginseng, apples, peaches, pears, sweet potatoes, green peppers, cabbage, and other fine varieties have been trial-planted in Bulgaria in recent years, and some have been successful and are beginning to be promoted. The Korichim Agricultural Experiment Station of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is conducting grafting experiments on excellent varieties of apples, pears, plums, and green peppers from both China and Bulgaria. The grafting experiment of excellent varieties of green peppers from the two countries has been very successful. The original Bulgarian green peppers, which were small and had thick skins, after being grafted with Chinese large green peppers, produced very full green peppers with thin skins and fleshy pulp. A Bulgarian comrade in charge of the grafting work excitedly told us: "The friendship and cooperation between our two countries is just like grafting fruit trees and green peppers, learning from each other's strengths to bear fruitful results, becoming more and more prosperous, and more and more flourishing."

### 我们欢迎增加新任务

　　我们欢迎增加新任务
    到保加利亚访问过的一些中国诗人和作家，总是意味深长地把中保两国人民间深厚的兄弟友谊，说成是盛开的花朵。这个比喻是再恰当也没有的了。在保加利亚的城市和农村，到处都洋溢着这朵鲜花放散的感人肺腑的芳香。
    “应尽的义务”
    近几年来，保加利亚为我国制造了柴油机车、电动机、变压器、水泵等机器，给予我国的社会主义建设以很大的支援。最近我们访问了索非亚市金属切削机床制造厂。在工厂的装配车间里，摆着好多精致美观的“C—9”型旋床。旋床上还罩着透亮的尼龙布套。“这都是给中国制造的，一共有四十台……。”两个年青工人热情地向我们介绍。
    到车间参观前，厂长丘拉科夫向我们说，今年厂里接受了给中国制造三十台“C—9”型旋床的订货，在工厂生产计划确定后，忽然又接到指示：再增加十台，共四十台。增加十台“C—9”型旋床，这是一个相当困难的任务。但是，职工们讨论这一任务时，无一例外地表示愿意接受，并保证在中华人民共和国建国十周年的节日以前，把四十台旋床运往我国。
    在车间里，我们紧紧地握着工人们的手，感谢他们对我国社会主义建设的兄弟支援。我们听到的总是这样的回答：“这是我们应尽的义务。”
    取长补短结硕果
    中国的人参、苹果、桃、梨、红薯、青椒、白菜等良种，这几年在保加利亚进行了试种，有的已经成功，开始推广。保加利亚科学院科里奇姆农业实验站正在进行着中保两国的苹果、梨、李子、青椒等优良品种的嫁接实验。两国青椒良种的嫁接实验很成功。本来是又小、皮又厚的保加利亚青椒，跟中国的大青椒嫁接后，结出的青椒非常丰满，皮薄肉多。负责嫁接工作的一个保加利亚同志兴奋地对我们说：“我们两国的友谊和合作恰像嫁接果树和青椒一样，取长补短结硕果，越来越昌盛，越来越繁荣。”
