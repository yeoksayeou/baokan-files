Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 3rd. The Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Seventh Office of the State Council, and the State Scientific and Technological Commission recently jointly convened the Second Desertification Control Conference in Urumqi, with representatives from relevant departments in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. The conference decided that based on the significant achievements in desertification control this year, efforts should continue to be ramped up, and next year, a large-scale mass desertification control movement should be universally launched in all desert areas that can be immediately managed. This year, the country has completed more than 25 million mu of desertification control, which is about one-third of the area controlled in the nine years since the founding of the People's Republic of China; in addition, more than 4,600 kilometers of sand barriers have been planted.

China's deserts and Gobi deserts are mainly distributed in the six provinces (regions) of Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, accounting for more than one-tenth of the country's land area, stretching for about 4,000 kilometers from east to west. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, especially since the first desertification control conference in October last year, which issued a battle call to launch a major offensive against the desert, the people of all ethnic groups in these provinces and regions have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm and achieved great results.

In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where deserts and Gobi deserts account for one-third of the area, farmers of all ethnic groups in the counties located on the southern edge of the Junggar Desert and in some shifting sand and semi-shifting sand areas of the Tarim Basin, with the help of airplanes sent by the state, sowed saxaul, artemisia, sand dates, and planted red willow, elm, poplar, grass, etc., covering more than 520,000 mu, and set up sand barriers of 14,500 meters. In order to ensure timely sowing within half a month after the snow melts in northern Xinjiang, and without affecting spring plowing, more than 80,000 people were mobilized to set up camps in the frozen land and constantly break labor quotas. In Hutubi County, animal-powered sowing averaged 192 mu per work day, exceeding the quota by 30%; manual sowing also averaged 79 mu per work day, exceeding the quota by 48%. When sowing, the vast number of Uygur farmers in southern Xinjiang braved the high temperatures in the Gobi Desert and overcame various other difficulties to complete their tasks on time. Many areas that were originally barren Gobi deserts are now dotted with green, with two to three saxaul seedlings per square meter, and the seedling survival area is about 40%.

In the sand areas of Gansu, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions, about 30% of the labor force participated in the desertification control battle this year, and they have also created many outstanding achievements. The secretary of the Yongchang County Party Committee in Gansu Province personally led more than 20,000 people to complete 93% of this year's desertification control tasks after a month of continuous hard work. Hangjin Rear Banner in Inner Mongolia broke the conventional afforestation in winter and completed 120,000 mu of desertification control in a ten-day blitz.

In accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the conference held that it is necessary to ramp up efforts and, while vigorously carrying out mass desertification control movements next year, combine regular management with large-scale concentrated efforts. In all areas where desertification control leading bodies have not been established, desertification control agencies should be established quickly, and commune and team forest farms should be established in a big way, and state-owned forest farms should be developed. In future desertification control work, the principles of "overall planning, comprehensive management, adapting to local conditions, and preparing defenses according to the harm" should continue to be implemented, and the spirit of "easy first, then difficult, near first, then far, point first, then surface, small first, then large" should be followed in the steps. Generally speaking, the focus of desertification control should currently be placed near farmland, railways, highways, industrial and mining enterprises, and residential areas, or on the edges of large deserts. In all desert areas that can be immediately managed, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses to adopt effective measures for universal management.

After a year of investigation by the Desertification Control Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it has been proven that the vegetation (plants growing in the desert, including pasture and trees) conditions in China's large deserts are much better than previously estimated. Fixed and semi-fixed dunes account for 98% of the Xiaotenggeli Desert, which is a good pasture for the local Mongolian people. Most of the Junggar Desert is fixed and semi-fixed dunes, with shifting sand accounting for only 3%. The desert contains large reserves of firewood and pasture, as well as many salt ponds, alkali ponds, and mirabilite ponds. The Badanjilin Desert also has sparse vegetation cover. Even the Tarim Basin Desert, which was once considered lifeless, has many ancient settlements inside, and groundwater has been found in some areas. South of Mazartag, there are lush patches of reeds, and red willows and poplars grow along the banks of the four larger rivers, forming strip-shaped natural forest belts. There are also large areas of dry primeval forest in the center of the desert, some of which are still alive. Many oases are scattered around the desert, and patches of red willow bushes lie between the oases and the desert, protecting farmland from wind and sand hazards.

All of this shows that protecting existing forests and pastures, developing comprehensive utilization of agriculture and animal husbandry, rationally utilizing land, and avoiding man-made wind and sand disasters are important measures for current desertification control, and also a good way to solve the current labor shortage in desertification control work. Therefore, the conference requested that all localities attach importance to and do a good job in protecting existing vegetation.

### 全面规划　综合治理　因地制宜　因害设防  九个月治沙二千五百万亩  明年将在一切能马上治理的沙区开始大规模治沙

    全面规划　综合治理　因地制宜　因害设防
    九个月治沙二千五百万亩
    明年将在一切能马上治理的沙区开始大规模治沙
    新华社乌鲁木齐3日电　中共中央农村工作部、国务院第七办公室和国家科学技术委员会最近在乌鲁木齐联合召集陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆和内蒙古等六省区有关部门的代表举行第二次治沙会议，决定在今年治沙工作取得重大成就的基础上，继续大鼓干劲，明年在一切能马上治理的沙区普遍开展大规模的群众性治沙运动。全国今年以来共完成的治沙面积两千五百多万亩，约等于全国解放后九年来治沙面积的三分之一；并且还栽沙障四千六百多公里。
    我国的沙漠和戈壁主要分布在内蒙古、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆六省（区），约占全国土地面积的十分之一多，东西长达四千公里左右。自从去年大跃进，特别是在去年10月第一次治沙会议，发出向沙漠大举进攻的战斗号召以来，这些省、区的各族人民都发挥了冲天干劲，取得了巨大成绩。
    在沙漠戈壁面积占三分之一的新疆维吾尔自治区，位于准噶尔沙漠南缘的各县和塔里木盆地部分流沙和半流沙地区的各族农民，在国家派飞机帮助下，共播种梭梭、沙蒿、沙枣和栽植红柳、榆、杨、草等达五十二万多亩，设置沙障一万四千五百米。北疆各地为了保证在积雪融化的半个月内按时播种，又不影响春耕生产，出动了八万多人在冰天雪地里安营下寨，并且不断突破劳动定额。呼图壁县畜力播种每工日平均达到一百九十二亩，超过定额30％；人力播种每工日平均也达到七十九亩，超过定额48％。南疆各地广大维吾尔族农民在播种时，曾冒着戈壁沙漠上的高温并战胜了其它各种困难，按时完成了任务。许多原来是荒漠的戈壁上，如今部分地区已是绿茵点点，梭梭苗每平方米有二到三株，保苗面积在40％左右。
    甘肃、内蒙古等省、区的沙区，今年约有30％的人力参加了治沙战斗，并且也都创造了许多突出的成绩。甘肃省永昌县委书记亲自领导两万多群众经过一个月的连续苦战，就完成了今年治沙任务的93％。内蒙古杭景后旗冬季打破常规造林，十天内突击完成治沙十二万亩。
    会议根据党的八届八中全会的精神，认为必须大鼓干劲，明年在大搞群众性的治沙运动的同时，要把经常的治理工作和大兵团突击结合起来。在所有没有建立治沙领导机构的地区，应迅速建立治沙机构，大办社、队林场，发展国营林场。在今后治沙工作中，仍应贯彻执行“全面规划，综合治理，因地制宜，因害设防”的原则，步骤上应本“先易后难，由近及远，由点到面，由小到大”的精神。一般的说，目前治沙的重点应先放在靠近农田、铁路、公路、工矿企业和居民点的附近或大沙漠的边缘。在一切能马上治理的沙区，必须深入发动群众采取有效办法普遍治理。
    经过一年来中国科学院治沙队的考察，证明我国大沙漠中的植被（沙漠中生长的植物包括牧草树木等）条件比过去的估计好得多。小腾格里沙地固定和半固定沙丘占98％，是当地蒙族人民的良好牧场。准噶尔沙漠大部为固定、半固定沙丘，流沙只占3％，沙漠中蕴藏着蓄积量很大的柴薪和牧草，并有不少的盐池、碱池和芒硝池，巴丹吉林沙漠也有稀疏的植被覆盖。就是过去一向被人认为没有生命的塔里木盆地沙漠，内部也有许多古代居民点，部分地区挖到地下水，玛扎尔塔克以南有葱绿的片片芦苇，四条较大河流的两岸生长红柳和胡杨，形成带状的天然林带。沙漠中心也有大片的干枯原始森林，其中个别的还活着。沙漠周围更散布着很多的绿洲，绿洲和沙漠之间有着成片的红柳丛林，屏障着农田免受风沙危害。
    这一切说明了保护现有的森林、牧草，发展农业牧业综合利用，合理利用土地，避免人为的风沙灾害，是当前治沙方面的重要措施，同时也是解决目前治沙工作中劳力紧张的好办法。因此会议要求各地要重视和作好现有植被的保护工作。
