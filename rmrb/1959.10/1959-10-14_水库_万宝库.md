　　Reservoir – A Treasure Trove
　　Qiū Yáng

　　In valley after valley, along river after river, in just a few years, millions of man-made lakes, large and small – reservoirs – have appeared. These reservoirs have tamed raging floods, irrigated millions of hectares of farmland, reduced suffering for the people, and increased happiness. But the role of reservoirs is not limited to this; they contain even more potential, waiting for hardworking and courageous people to tap into. Nature's treasures are infinitely rich. To develop them, one must have sufficient strength, dare to bring forth such strength, and use that strength in the right way.

　　Since the people formed People's Communes, they have the strength to attack nature on a larger scale and also the power to attack nature more deeply. Unfolding before the people is a boundless new world. As long as we greatly liberate our thinking, so that the liberation of thought adapts to the liberation of productive forces, possess great courage and great wisdom, and make every effort to maximize the utilization and development of nature's treasure trove, we will surely be able to create even greater happiness. Since the People's Communes can build more and larger reservoirs, they will inevitably be able to make these reservoirs yield more and better wealth. There is a reservoir in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi, named "Happiness Reservoir," which truly contains an endless spring of happiness. The managers of this reservoir are indeed skilled at creating happiness for the people.

　　Happiness Reservoir is a reservoir capable of irrigating more than 100,000 mu of farmland. After its completion, in addition to ensuring irrigation needs, the reservoir management personnel adopted a policy of focusing on fish farming and engaging in diversified operations on a large scale, turning this reservoir into a commodity production base. This year, it is estimated that the reservoir's various operations will generate a total income of 300,000 yuan. After deducting approximately 100,000 yuan for investment and management expenses for the various productions operated by the reservoir itself, there are still 200,000 yuan that can be used for reservoir maintenance and expanded reproduction – they call this "using water to nurture water." If the reservoir's expenses can be self-sufficient, the production costs of agriculture can be reduced, the public accumulation of the commune and investments needed in other areas can be increased, agricultural production can develop faster, and commune members' incomes can increase even more.

　　Why is Happiness Reservoir able to do this? The main reason is that the reservoir management personnel fully recognized the possibility of using their own power to develop more treasures, possessing vision, a spirit of enterprise, and a passion for creating benefits for the people. They do not limit their vision to reservoir management work such as releasing and storing water, but rather observe in all directions, seeing the abundant natural resources for developing diversified operations within the reservoir itself and around the reservoir, and thinking of ways to allow the mountains, waters, grass, and trees to benefit the people. They also see the advantages of focusing on fish farming while simultaneously developing animal husbandry, agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations, and the relationships of mutual dependence and mutual promotion between them.

　　There are currently more than sixty large reservoirs and millions of medium and small reservoirs in the country. The locations of the reservoirs generally have good natural conditions for carrying out diversified operations. After reservoirs are built, they must be managed and maintained by dedicated personnel; and the work of management and maintenance is seasonal. Therefore, the strength of the reservoir management personnel is also a huge force for developing production. Carrying out diversified operations around reservoirs can fully utilize land and resources, and also fully utilize human resources. Let us all learn from the example of Dongxiang County and turn every reservoir into a "Happiness Reservoir"! Truly:

　　The flowers bloom better and better, the people become more and more skillful;
　　The valleys bloom with a hundred flowers, the reservoirs gather ten thousand treasures.

　　水库——万宝库
　　秋阳
    一道道峡谷里，一条条河流上，几年间，出现了几百万个大大小小的人造湖泊——水库。这些水库制服了横暴的洪水，灌溉了千万顷农田，为人民减少了祸害，增加了幸福。但是，水库的作用还不仅此，它蕴藏着更多的潜力，等待着勤劳勇敢的人们去采取。大自然的宝藏是无限丰富的。要开发出来，必须有足够的力量，也必须敢于拿出这样的力量，还要用正确的方法使用这样的力量。
    人们组成人民公社以后，有力量更大规模地向自然进攻了，也有力量更深入地向自然进攻了。展开在人们面前的，是一个无限广阔的新天地。只要思想大解放，使思想的解放适应生产力的解放，有大勇，有大智，千方百计地最大限度地利用和开发自然宝库，就一定能创造更大的幸福。人民公社既然能修建更多更大的水库，也必然能使这些水库交出更多更好的财富。江西东乡县有一座水库，名字就叫“幸福水库”，它蕴藏的真是无尽的幸福的泉水，这座水库的管理者，也的确善于为人民创造幸福。
    幸福水库是一座能灌田十多万亩的水库。在它建成以后，水库管理人员除了确保灌溉需要而外，还采取了以养鱼为主、大搞多种经营的方针，使这座水库成为一个商品生产基地。今年估计水库经营的各业共可收入三十万元，除去水库本身经营的各项生产的投资和管理费用约十万元外，还有二十万元可以用于水库维修和扩大再生产——他们把这叫做“以水养水”。水库的费用能够自给，农业的生产成本就能降低，公社的公共积累和其它方面需要的投资就能增加，农业生产就能发展得更快，社员收入就能增加得更多。
    幸福水库为什么能够这样？主要是水库管理人员充分认识了运用本身的力量开发更多的宝藏的可能性，有识见，有进取心，有为人民造福的热情。他们不把眼光限制在放水、储水等水库管理工作上，而是放眼观察四面八方，看到了水库本身和水库周围发展多种经营的丰富的自然资源，而且想方设法让山水草木都能为人民兴利。他们还看到了以养鱼为主、同时发展畜牧业、农业、林业和副业的好处，和它们之间互相依存、互相促进的关系。
    全国现有大型水库六十多个，中小型水库几百万个。水库所在之地，大都有开展多种经营的良好自然条件。水库修建起来之后，必须有专人管理、养护；而管理养护的工作又是有季节性的。因此，水库管理人员的力量，也是发展生产的一支巨大的力量。围绕着水库开展多种经营，既可以充分利用地力、物力，也可以充分运用人力。都学习东乡县的榜样，把每个水库都变成“幸福水库”吧！正是：
    花越开越好，人越干越巧；
    山谷开百花，水库聚万宝。
