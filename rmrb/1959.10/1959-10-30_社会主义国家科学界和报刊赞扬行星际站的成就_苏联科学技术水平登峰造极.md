Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Scientific research workers in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing, after seeing the photographs of the far side of the moon taken by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station, warmly praised the great achievements of Soviet science and technology.

Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing, said: "The discovery of a new continent on the moon is very different from the discovery of a new continent on Earth in the fifteenth century. On Earth, the map of the Western Hemisphere was slowly and gradually accumulated. The new continent on the far side of the moon, photographed by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station and transmitted to the human world, allows us to immediately have a clear view of the mountains and rivers of the new continent on the moon." He said: "People have always valued the first discoverer; we admire the heroes who first discovered the new continent and the North and South Poles. The far side of the moon has been a mystery for ages. Now, for the first time, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station has photographed it in its entirety and transmitted it to Earth using radio facsimile technology. This is another unprecedented and great contribution made by the Soviet Union to the scientific history of mankind." He said: "There are many theories about the birth and evolution of the moon, and they have been debated. Now, the photos of the far side of the moon have almost instantly increased all our observational data about the moon by 50%, which will certainly play a significant role in solving the problems of the moon's birth and evolution."

Lü Baowei, researcher of the Preparatory Office of the Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and assistant researchers Zhang Zhicheng and Lu Zhigang said: "The orbit of the space rocket is observed by radio. The observed data must be quickly obtained by the calculation equipment on the ground to derive the instantaneous position, flight speed, and flight direction of the rocket, and calculate the error between the actual orbit and the predetermined orbit. Then, the signal is sent by radio to control the flight of the rocket. The work of some instruments and equipment in the rocket, such as the photographing of the moon, must be automatically carried out under the control of electronic circuits. Various observed data must be transmitted to the ground by radio. We can't help but admire the clarity of the restored images we saw in the newspaper. The Soviet Union has excellently solved the problems of long-distance transmission and reception of signals, temperature control on the rocket, powerful solar and chemical batteries, and other radio components. In the future, space rockets will fly to more distant space, and manned rockets traveling in space will become a reality. These will put forward more and higher requirements and new problems for radio electronics." Gong Huiren, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Xujiahui Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "The image of the far side of the moon, which people on Earth have never seen before, has met with everyone in the newspapers. From then on, the secrets of the far side of the moon were revealed for the first time. This fully proves that the Soviet Union's science and technology has reached a very high level, and also shows that the socialist system has a strong creative power. It has only been two years from the Soviet Union launching the first artificial earth satellite to launching the third cosmic rocket with an automatic interplanetary station. In these two years, the Soviet Union has obviously made another big step forward in automatic control technology and space exploration. The Soviet Union has entered a period of planned conquest of outer space."

This newspaper's comprehensive report. According to Xinhua News Agency: Socialist countries' scientific circles and newspapers warmly praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in photographing the far side of the moon.

The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily" published an article saying that the far side of the moon is no longer invisible. We are glad that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in the race to explore outer space, and will take the lead in all aspects. "Labor Daily" published an article by Kadaví, director of the Petrřín Observatory, saying that the Soviet Union's photographs of the far side of the moon are a technical miracle. The great achievements of Soviet science are the pinnacle of human wisdom.

The Korean "Labor News" published a commentary saying that Soviet science has once again made an extraordinary contribution. The far side of the moon has revealed its true image in front of Soviet science. This is a miracle, worthy of great praise.

All major Bulgarian newspapers published editorials on the 28th, praising the Soviet Union's new scientific achievement. "Workers' Cause" said that people have been able to see the other side of the moon, which was once an unsolved mystery for mankind. This is an unparalleled scientific feat.

Romania's "Free Romania" wrote on the 28th that the new unprecedented victory of Soviet science and technology was achieved on the eve of the October Revolution, which is a matter of great significance. This victory once again powerfully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.

### 社会主义国家科学界和报刊赞扬行星际站的成就  苏联科学技术水平登峰造极

    社会主义国家科学界和报刊赞扬行星际站的成就
    苏联科学技术水平登峰造极
    新华社29日讯　上海、南京、北京的科学研究工作者看到苏联自动行星际站拍摄的月球背面照片后，热烈称赞苏联科学技术的伟大成就。
    中国科学院南京紫金山天文台台长张钰哲说：月球上发现新大陆和地球上十五世纪发现新大陆的情形，有一个很不相同的地方。在地球上是慢慢地点滴地累积起来，才绘成西半球的地图。而月球背面这块新大陆，经苏联自动行星际站拍成照片，传到人间，使我们立刻能对于月球新大陆的山川形势，一目了然。他说：人们一向重视第一个发现者，我们钦仰第一个发现新大陆和南北极的英雄；月球背面情况，是千古哑谜，现在经苏联的自动行星际站第一次把它全部拍成照片，用无线电传真技术送到地球上来，这是苏联对人类科学历史作出的又一个空前伟大的贡献。他说：月球的诞生和演化，有许多学说，一直在争论着。现在月球背面的照片几乎把我们所有的关于月球的观测数据，一下子增加了50％，这对于月球诞生和演化问题的解决，一定可以起很大的作用。
    中国科学院电子学研究所筹备处研究员吕保维和助理研究员张志诚、陆志刚说：宇宙火箭的轨道是用无线电来进行观测的，观测到的数据要经过地面上的计算设备迅速得出火箭的瞬时位置、飞行速度和飞行方向，并且算出实际轨道与预定轨道间的误差，然后用无线电把信号送去以控制火箭的飞行。火箭内一些仪器设备的工作，如月球相片的拍摄等，要用电子线路的控制来自动进行，各种观测到的数据要用无线电传送到地面。我们从报上看到还原后的图像的清晰程度，实在不能不感到敬服。苏联卓越地解决了远距离传送和接收信号的问题、火箭上控制温度的问题、强大的太阳能及化学电池和其它无线电元件的问题。今后宇宙火箭将飞向更远的太空，载人的火箭在宇宙间航行将成为现实，这些都为无线电电子学提出更多更高的要求和新问题。中国科学院徐家汇观象台副总工程师龚惠人说：地球上的人们从来没有看到过的月亮背面图型，在报纸上和大家见面了，从此第一次揭开了月亮背面的秘密，这充分证明了苏联的科学技术已经达到极高的水平，同时也说明了社会主义制度有强大的创造力量。从苏联发射第一颗人造地球卫星到发射带有自动行星际站的第三个宇宙火箭只有两年时间，在这两年内苏联在自动控制技术和宇宙探测方面显然又先进了一大步，苏联已经进入了有计划地征服宇宙空间的时期。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：社会主义国家科学界和报刊热烈赞扬苏联拍摄月球背面照片的光辉成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表文章说，月球背面已经不是看不见的了。我们高兴的是，苏联在探测宇宙空间的竞赛中占了首位，并且将在各方面占首位。“劳动报”刊登佩特尔任天文台台长卡达维的一篇文章说，苏联拍摄的月球背面的照片是技术的奇迹。苏联科学的巨大成就是人类智慧发展的顶峰。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表评论说，苏联科学这次又作出了不平常的贡献，月球的背面在苏联科学面前显出了真象。这是一个奇迹，值得大加赞扬。
    保加利亚各主要报纸28日都发表社论，赞扬苏联这个科学的新成就。“工人事业报”说，人们已能看到了曾是人类不解之谜的月球的另一面，这是无与伦比的科学功勋。
    罗马尼亚的“自由罗马尼亚报”28日写道，苏联科学技术新的空前的胜利是在十月革命节前夕取得的，这是一件具有重大意义的事。这个胜利再一次有力地表明了社会主义制度的优越性。
