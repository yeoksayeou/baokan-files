Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report entitled "Hold High the Red Banner of the Party's General Line and Strive for the Continued Leap Forward of Socialist Construction." In its congratulatory speech, the Party Central Committee extended its warmest congratulations to all the delegates to the congress and to the working class of our country, and issued an extremely glorious battle call to the working class of our country and the people of the whole country: In order to realize the long term goal of building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture in a not too long period of time, we must first catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years; at the same time, we must realize the technical transformation of agriculture in our country as soon as possible, and realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization and electrification of agriculture. The congratulatory speech called on the working class of our country and the people of the whole country to redouble their efforts to achieve this great task.

Today, the Great Hall of the People, where the heroic figures of all nationalities of our great era gather, is filled with a joyous atmosphere. On the chests of many representatives, rows of medals shimmered with dazzling brilliance, and many new heroes who emerged in the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued Leap Forward today wore their first medals on their chests. The most outstanding figures among them sat on the rostrum of the conference together with the leaders of the Party and the State. On the rostrum, ten huge red flags surrounded the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. The platform was covered with blooming flowers. In the dome of the Great Hall, hundreds of bright lights were like stars in the sky, shining together. They symbolize the brilliance and splendid prospects of our great socialist construction cause.

At 3 p.m., Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping and other Party and State leaders stepped onto the rostrum amidst thunderous and warm applause from the audience. Together with them on the rostrum were Lin Boqu, Peng Zhen, Luo Ronghuan, Li Fuchun, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Lu Dingyi, Kang Sheng, Bo Yibo, alternate members of the Political Bureau; Yang Shangkun, alternate member of the Secretariat; Nie Rongzhen and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Ye Jianying, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court; Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, as well as the heads of various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, various departments of the Central State Organs, various people's organizations, and all members of the presidium of the conference.

After Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, announced the official opening of the conference, the band played the solemn national anthem. Liu Ningyi said in his opening speech that the leaders of the Party and the State and the responsible comrades of various people's organizations have all participated in today's conference, which shows their concern and support for the conference. When Liu Ningyi called on all the delegates to respond to the care and expectations of the Party and the State with new and brilliant achievements, the audience applauded thunderously and for a long time, fully expressing the firm determination of all the delegates to achieve leap forward after leap forward on the road to victory. Liu Ningyi, on behalf of all the delegates to the conference, expressed a warm welcome to the representatives of the heroic People's Liberation Army who are defending the great motherland, the representatives of the peasants who are holding high the red banner of the People's Commune and forging ahead bravely, the representatives of the scientific and cultural circles, the railway soldiers, the migrant workers and the family members of the workers, as well as guests from other fields who were invited to attend the conference. At this time, thunderous applause resounded once again in the grand and spacious Great Hall of the People.

In his opening speech, Liu Ningyi warmly praised the representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers attending this conference as heroes of our great era, pioneers in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and vanguards in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. They concentratedly demonstrated the Chinese working class's high degree of communist consciousness and fighting will, and were worthy of being the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Liu Ningyi said: "With such a heroic team that is infinitely loyal to the Party, to the motherland, and to the people, our cause will be invincible."

Liu Ningyi hoped that all the delegates would enthusiastically respond to the series of new and glorious battle calls issued by the Party and the State to the people of the whole country, make this conference a success, and arouse greater revolutionary vigor to march towards new goals. He said: "Here, let us guarantee to the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao: We must hold high the glorious red banner of the general line, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance along the road of victory towards new and more magnificent goals! Forge ahead bravely!"

Amidst the long and thunderous applause of more than 6,000 representatives, Comrade Zhu De then delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the conference. The congratulatory speech of the Central Committee of the Party pointed out that when this conference is held, our country is in a new upsurge of the vigorous mass movement of opposing right-leaning, encouraging vigor, and practicing increased production and conservation. According to the current situation, it can be said with complete certainty that the 1959 national economic plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. This year's continued leap forward of our country's national economy on the basis of the extraordinary leap forward in 1958 eloquently shows that our country's socialist system has unlimited vitality and fully proves that the Party's general line for building socialism is completely correct.

The congratulatory speech of the Central Committee of the Party said: "The reason why our country has been able to develop the national economy at a speed unmatched by all capitalist countries in the past ten years, especially in the recent two years, and has achieved unprecedented achievements in the history of our country, is, in the final analysis, the great victory of the mass movement led by the Party and the great victory of the Party's mass line."

In its congratulatory speech, the Central Committee of the Party put forward glorious and long-term goals of struggle to the working class of the whole country and the people of the whole country, as well as the current battle tasks of completing the national economic plan this year ahead of schedule and preparing for the continued leap forward next year. The congratulatory speech then warmly praised all the delegates attending the conference, saying: "You are representatives of advanced units and advanced producers on the industrial, transportation, basic construction, financial and trade fronts, and are the most valuable assets of our Party and State. Your achievements are the glory of the people." The congratulatory speech concluded: "We hope that the representatives of advanced units and advanced producers present here will not only be modest and prudent, study diligently, and strive to maintain the title of advanced for their units and themselves, but also carry forward the communist style and help other units and other people catch up with the advanced level. The Party Central Committee believes that you will be able to accomplish this glorious task."

The congratulatory speech of the Central Committee of the Party was full of infinite care and trust in the workers of the whole country, and full of earnest encouragement and expectations. Every word of it inspired the hearts of all the delegates. Every time Comrade Zhu De finished a paragraph, the hall burst into prolonged applause like spring thunder. After the congratulatory speech, Liu Ningyi immediately guaranteed on behalf of all the heroes of the conference: The beloved Party Central Committee has put forward a great battle call to us, and we must respond to this call with practical actions. At this time, thunderous and warm applause once again shook the magnificent Great Hall of the People.

Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, then delivered a report to the conference. In his report, he explained in detail the excellent situation and future tasks on the current national economic construction front, and called on advanced producers and workers across the country to, together with the people of the whole country, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold higher the red banner of the socialist general line and fight heroically for the continued leap forward of socialist construction.

Li Fuchun pointed out that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the national economy in 1959 will definitely be able to achieve a continued leap forward. That is to say, in our country, there has already been formed a comprehensive leap forward situation with both great development of industry and great development of agriculture, both great development of central economic undertakings and great development of local economic undertakings, and both high speed and proportionality. This situation is the most basic thing in the current economic situation in our country.

In expounding the great role of the socialist general line in promoting the Great Leap Forward of our country's national economy, Li Fuchun emphasized that the Party's general line for building socialism and a set of "walking on two legs" policies give us not the leap forward of individual departments, but the leap forward of the entire national economy, not the leap forward of individual years, but the continuous leap forward. The reason why the Party's socialist construction general line can exert such great power is because it has solved the most universal and most essential problem in our country's socialist construction, that is, the problem of giving the fullest play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people.

Li Fuchun said that in order to achieve the goal put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year, strive to catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and strive to complete the requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program greatly ahead of schedule, we must strive for the continued leap forward of the national economy in the coming years, especially in 1960.

Li Fuchun emphatically pointed out that in promoting the continued leap forward of the national economy, we must first ensure the leap forward of agriculture. Supporting agricultural construction and promoting the development of agricultural production are increasingly important tasks for industrial departments in the coming period.

After separately explaining the tasks of the continued leap forward of various departments such as agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce in our country next year, Li Fuchun pointed out that to achieve the continued leap forward next year, we must first grasp the work in the fourth quarter of this year. He emphasized that we should carry the struggle against right-leaning through to the end, continue to arouse the revolutionary vigor of the broad masses of workers, and along the road of the Great Leap Forward opened up in 1958, carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy more extensively and more deeply, better complete this year's tasks, and prepare for next year's production and construction.

Li Fuchun's report was warmly welcomed by the delegates, and prolonged applause rang out in the hall time and time again.

The conference adjourned at 5:20 p.m. The conference will continue tomorrow.

    新华社26日讯　全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会，今天下午在宏伟的人民大会堂隆重开幕。这次群英大会是全国职工向毛主席、向党和国家汇报大跃进伟大成就的检阅大会，是一个高举社会主义建设总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，向着新的远大目标奋勇前进的誓师大会。
    中共中央副主席朱德代表中共中央在今天的大会上致祝词，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春在会上作了题为“高举党的总路线的红旗为社会主义建设事业的继续跃进而奋斗”的报告。党中央在祝词中向大会全体代表和我国工人阶级致以最热烈的祝贺，并且向我国工人阶级和全国人民发出了极其光荣的战斗号召：为了实现在一个不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家的远大目标，我们首先要在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国；与此同时，我们要尽快地实现我国的农业技术改造，实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。祝词要求我国工人阶级和全国人民为实现这个伟大的任务而加倍努力。
    今天，聚集着我们伟大时代各民族英雄人物的人民大会堂，洋溢着一片喜气洋洋的欢乐气氛。许多代表的胸前，成排的奖章闪烁着耀眼光辉，许多在去年大跃进和今天继续跃进中涌现出来的新英雄，胸前佩带着第一颗奖章。他们当中最杰出的人物，今天同党和国家的领导人一起，坐在大会主席台上。主席台上，十面巨幅红旗簇拥着伟大领袖毛主席的画像。台前布满竞放的鲜花。大会堂的顶空，数百盏明灯犹如满天星斗，齐放光芒。它们象征着我们伟大的社会主义建设事业光辉灿烂，一片好景。
    下午三时，刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、林彪、邓小平等党和国家的领导人，在全场暴风雨般的热烈掌声中登上主席台。同他们一起登上主席台的，还有中共中央政治局委员林伯渠、彭真、罗荣桓、李富春、刘伯承、贺龙、李先念、谭震林，政治局候补委员陆定一、康生、薄一波，书记处候补书记杨尚昆，国务院副总理聂荣臻、习仲勋，人大常委会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、程潜、林枫，国防委员会副主席叶剑英、张治中、傅作义，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，以及中共中央各部门、中央国家机关各部门、各人民团体的负责人和大会主席团的全体成员。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一宣布大会正式开幕以后，乐队奏起庄严的国歌。刘宁一在开幕词中说，党和国家的领导人和各人民团体的负责同志都参加了今天的大会，这表示了他们对大会的关怀和支持。当刘宁一号召全体代表以新的光辉成就回答党和国家的关怀和期望时，全场掌声雷动，经久不息，充分表达了全体代表在胜利的道路上实现跃进再跃进的坚定决心。对应邀参加大会的保卫着伟大祖国国防的英勇的人民解放军代表，高举人民公社红旗奋勇前进的农民代表，科学文化界、铁道兵、民工和职工家属代表以及其他方面的来宾，刘宁一在开幕词中代表大会全体代表表示热烈欢迎。这时，宏大宽敞的大会堂里再一次响起雷鸣般的掌声。
    刘宁一在开幕词中热烈称颂出席这次大会的先进集体和先进生产者代表是我们伟大时代的英雄，是执行党的社会主义建设总路线的先锋，是社会主义建设大跃进的尖兵，他们集中地表现了中国工人阶级高度的共产主义觉悟和战斗意志，不愧是中华民族最优秀的儿女。刘宁一说：“有了这样一支对党、对祖国、对人民无限忠心的英雄队伍，我们的事业就会无往而不胜。”
    刘宁一希望全体代表热烈响应党和国家向全国人民发出的一系列新的光荣的战斗号召，开好这次大会，鼓起更大的革命干劲向新的目标进军。他说：“在这里，让我们向伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席保证：我们一定高举总路线的光辉红旗，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，沿着胜利的道路，向着新的更加宏伟的目标，前进！奋勇前进！”
    迎着六千多代表长时间的暴风雨般的热烈掌声，朱德同志接着在大会上代表中共中央致祝词。党中央的祝词中指出，当这次大会召开的时候，我们的国家正处在反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的轰轰烈烈的群众运动的新高潮中。根据现在的情况，可以完全有把握地说，1959年国民经济计划将提前完成和超额完成。今年我国国民经济在1958年特大跃进基础上的继续跃进，雄辩地说明我国的社会主义制度具有无限生命力，充分地证明党的建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。
    党中央的祝词中说：“我国在过去十年中特别是最近两年中之所以能够以所有资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度发展国民经济，获得了我国历史上空前未有的成就，归根到底，是党所领导的群众运动的伟大胜利，是党的群众路线的伟大胜利。”
    党中央在祝词中向全国工人阶级和全国人民提出了光荣的远大的奋斗目标，以及提前完成今年国民经济计划和为明年继续跃进作好准备的当前战斗任务。祝词接着热烈赞扬出席大会的全体代表说：“你们是工业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易战线上的先进单位的代表和先进生产者，是我们党和国家的最宝贵的财产，你们的成就是人民的光荣。”祝词最后说：“我们希望在座的先进单位的代表和先进生产者同志们不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进的称号，而且要发扬共产主义的风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平。党中央相信你们一定能够完成这个光荣的任务。”
    党中央的祝词充满了对全国职工的无限关怀和信任，充满了殷切的鼓励和期望，它的一字一句都激励着全体代表的心。朱德同志每讲完一段，会场上就爆发出长时间的春雷般的掌声。祝词结束后，刘宁一当场代表大会全体英雄保证说：亲爱的党中央向我们提出了伟大的战斗号召，我们一定要以实际行动响应这个号召。这时，暴风雨般的热烈掌声，再一次振荡着宏伟的大会堂。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春接着向大会作报告。他在报告中详细说明了当前全国经济建设战线上的大好形势和今后的任务，号召全国先进生产者和广大职工同全国人民一道，在中国共产党和毛主席的引导下，更高地举起社会主义总路线的红旗，为社会主义建设事业的继续跃进而英勇奋斗。
    李富春指出，在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年的国民经济肯定能够取得继续跃进。这就是说，在我国已经形成了又有工业大发展又有农业大发展，又有中央经济事业大发展又有地方经济事业大发展，又有高速度又有按比例的全面跃进局面。这种局面，就是当前我国经济形势中最基本的东西。
    在阐述社会主义建设总路线在促进我国国民经济大跃进的巨大作用时，李富春强调指出，党的建设社会主义的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，给予我们的并不是个别部门的跃进，而是整个国民经济的跃进，不是个别年份的跃进，而是连续不断的跃进。党的社会主义建设总路线所以能够发挥出如此巨大的力量，是因为它解决了我国社会主义建设中的最普遍和最本质的问题，即最充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性的问题。
    李富春说，为了实现党的八届八中全会提出的在今年提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标，争取在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，并且争取大大提前完成全国农业发展纲要规定的要求，我们必须争取在今后年份首先是1960年国民经济的继续跃进。
    李富春着重指出，在促进国民经济继续跃进中，必须首先保证农业的跃进。支援农业建设，促进农业生产的发展，是工业部门在今后时期愈来愈重要的任务。
    李富春在分别说明了明年我国农业、工业、交通运输、商业等各部门的继续跃进的任务后指出，要取得明年的继续跃进，首先要抓紧今年第四季度的工作。他强调说，我们应当把反对右倾的斗争进行到底，继续鼓足广大职工的革命干劲，沿着1958年开辟的大跃进的道路，把增产节约运动更加广泛、更加深入地开展起来，更好地完成今年的任务，并为明年的生产建设做好准备。
    李富春的报告受到了代表们的热烈欢迎，场内一次又一次地响起了经久不息的掌声。
    下午五时二十分，大会休会。明天，大会将继续进行。
