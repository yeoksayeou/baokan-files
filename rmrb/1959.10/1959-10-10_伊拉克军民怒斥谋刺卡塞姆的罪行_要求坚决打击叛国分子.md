Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 8th: Since last night, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense has been receiving thousands of telegrams from military personnel and civilians expressing their anger at the assassination attempt on Qassem.

    Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General Ahmed Saleh al-Abdi's telegram condemned the "criminal attack of the criminals" and assured the Prime Minister that the army is "guarding against them."

    Colonel Abdul Karim Jidda, Commander of the Military Police and Acting Garrison Commander of Baghdad, said in a telegram that "the traitorous assassins are agents of imperialism and they have failed."

    Telegrams from the commanders of the First and Third Divisions, the acting commander of the Fifth Division, and the Garrison Commander of Mosul expressed support for Qassem, condemned the imperialists, and demanded resolute action against the traitors.

    A telegram from Jawahiri, Chairman of the Iraqi Press Syndicate, stated, "Millions of people from the depths of their pure hearts demand that you take swift action during your medical treatment to eradicate the evils and sins caused by your leniency." Telegrams from staff members of the People's Court, the General Federation of Farmers' Associations, the Teachers' Union, and members of the Student Union expressed support for Qassem, condemned the imperialists, and demanded resolute action against the traitors.

    Iraqi newspapers today expressed outrage at the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Qassem and demanded severe punishment for those traitors and reactionaries who are carrying out conspiracies against the Iraqi Republic.

    "People's Unity" newspaper said that this assassination attempt is a signal of the fourth conspiracy against the Iraqi Republic, its leader, and national independence. The newspaper pointed out that this conspiracy was jointly planned by groups abroad opposing Iraq and reactionary elements within the country. The newspaper called on the masses to maintain a high degree of vigilance.

    In a telegram to Prime Minister Qassem published on the same day, "People's Unity" newspaper said that the followers of the traitorous Shawwaf and Tabakchali are tools of the conspiracies of imperialists and groups of greedy individuals colluding with them. Their assassination attempt was aimed at destroying the achievements of the Iraqi democratic revolution and suppressing the Arab liberation movement.

    "National News" said in an editorial that imperialism and its puppets, as well as those who are angered by the order of the Republic and covet Iraq's wealth and resources, will not "stop creating conspiracies to overthrow the Republic and undermine its achievements."

    "Nation's Newspaper" and "Voice of the Free" both pointed out that the crime of attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Qassem clearly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the claims of the reactionaries and anti-communist propagandists, and that their real purpose is to divide the people, subvert the Republic, and undermine its leadership. Both newspapers demanded that resolute measures be taken against the traitors and that the enemies of the Republic no longer be given freedom.

    “人民团结报”在同一天发表的给卡塞姆总理的电报中说，沙瓦夫和塔巴克沙利这些叛国分子的党羽是帝国主义者和同他们相勾结的贪婪分子集团的阴谋活动的工具，他们进行暗杀的目的是企图摧毁伊拉克民主革命的成果和镇压阿拉伯解放运动。
