　　Everyone Innovates in Production
　　Czechoslovakia Launches Mass Technological Innovation Movement

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 13th: A movement called "Everyone Produces in an Innovative Way" is unfolding in factories and enterprises throughout Czechoslovakia. This movement is a mass technological innovation campaign. It calls on advanced workers to pass on their experiences and techniques to others, so that everyone can master the most advanced production technology, thereby universally improving production, saving materials, reducing waste, and better fulfilling the tasks assigned by the state.

　　This movement was initiated by workers at the Pissok Machinery Factory in the Slovak region. Fifty-eight technological innovators from this factory proposed that each person should be responsible for helping seven to twelve workers.

　　The development of this movement has transformed this previously backward factory. Workers Vida and Rikhnavsky, in last year's production, had scrap worth about 1,000 crowns, but this year, with the help of advanced workers, they have not produced a single piece of scrap so far. Female worker Pindosuva used to complete 180% of her quota, but in the past month, after learning advanced experience, she has reached 240% of her quota.

　　After the launch of the "Everyone Produces in an Innovative Way" movement, it was responded to by factories and enterprises across the country. Twenty-five machinery factories in the Slovak region studied the experience of promoting this movement at the Pissok factory and exchanged advanced technologies in each other's production. After a mechanical factory in Hlinik promoted this movement, the workers put forward more rationalization proposals.

### 人人都来革新生产  捷展开群众性技术革新运动

　　人人都来革新生产
    捷展开群众性技术革新运动
    据新华社布拉格13日电　一个称为“每人都以革新的方式生产”的运动正在捷克斯洛伐克全国各地的工厂企业中展开。这一运动是群众性的技术革新运动。它要求先进工作者将自己的经验和技术传授给别人，使每个人都能掌握最先进的生产技术，从而普遍提高生产，节约材料，减少废品，更好地完成国家规定的任务。
    这一运动是由斯洛伐克地区彼索克机械工厂的工人发起的。这个工厂的五十八名技术革新者提出每人要负责帮助七名至十二名工人。
    这一运动的开展使这个原来生产比较落后的工厂面貌一新。工人维达和里赫纳夫斯基在去年的生产中，曾出了价值约一千克朗的废品，而今年他们在先进工人的帮助下，至今还没有出过一件废品。女工平多苏娃从前完成定额180％，最近一个月来由于学习了先进经验，完成定额达到240％。
    “每人都以革新方式生产”的运动发起后，得到了全国各地工厂企业的响应。斯洛伐克地区的二十五个机械工厂曾在彼索克工厂学习了推广这一运动的经验，并交流了彼此生产中的先进技术。赫利尼克的一个机械工厂推广这一运动后，工人们都提出了更多的合理化建议。
