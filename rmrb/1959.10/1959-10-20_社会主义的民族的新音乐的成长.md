The Growth of New Socialist National Music
　　Lü Ji
    The Flourishing of Musical Creation
    Over the past decade, the victory of the socialist revolution and the rapid development of socialist construction have greatly changed the backward face of old China. Due to the fundamental change in production relations, completely new relationships have been established between people, with no more oppression or exploitation; the old class concepts have lost their material basis, and therefore the old moral concepts, old standards of reason, and old aesthetic viewpoints have inevitably been replaced by new ones. New social relationships and new life have given rise to new moral concepts, new standards of reason, and new aesthetic viewpoints.
    Music, as a component of socialist art, is rapidly changing its face with the growth of the new spiritual life. It can be said that socialist music precisely reflects the enormous changes in the spiritual life of the Chinese people, especially the growth of the new spiritual outlook, thus gaining a more powerful spiritual force. The new style is becoming increasingly distinct, and it is increasingly able to develop and flourish in real life.
    The victories achieved in the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the various struggles to defend socialist construction have guaranteed the development of socialist construction in our country and have also unfolded a completely new, vast, and magnificent prospect for our culture and art, allowing us to see that this era is truly a great and poetic era. Exciting creations can be seen everywhere in life, and the victory of new things over old things can be seen everywhere, which cannot but arouse many new feelings among our music workers, and everyone cannot but express these new feelings in their own creations. The growth of new life is undoubtedly the greatest driving force for the development of our music. Over the past decade, we have not only seen the rapid growth of musical creation and the improvement of performance levels, but also the development of musical theory research; especially since the Great Leap Forward movement last year, the vigorous development of all aspects of work has been very exciting; the achievements made by many young musicians are especially worthy of our joy.
    The growth of creative forces and the prosperity of creation are very significant, and this is even clearer in large-scale works such as choral works, operas, dance dramas, symphonic poems, and symphonies. Before last year, the number of large-scale creations was not very large, and some aspects were almost blank; since last year, the situation has changed greatly, and not only have many choral works and operas been created, but also many symphonic works and dance dramas. Over the past decade, we can list the following works that are well-known and that express our era: Ma Sicong's "Mountain Forest Song" Symphony, Li Huanzhi's "Festival Overture" Symphonic Suite, Shi Lemeng's "Long Live the Motherland" Chorus, Li Jiefu's "Victory Flowers Bloom Everywhere" Medley, Zheng Zhenyu's "Changbai Mountain Chorus," Xiao Bai et al.'s "Happiness River Chorus," Lu Haolin et al.'s "People's Commune is Good" Chorus—these are songs praising the motherland, praising victory, and praising the new life; Luo Zhongrong's "Ming Tombs Reservoir Symphonic Overture," He Luting's "Ming Tombs Reservoir Chorus," Qu Xixian's "Sanmenxia Chorus," Xie Gongcheng's "Yangtze River Bridge Chorus," Ma Sicong's "Huai River Chorus," and Zhang Lu's "Locking the Dragon Pool" Chorus—these are songs singing of our country's socialist construction; Qu Wei's "Monument to the People's Heroes Symphony," Luo Zhongrong's "First Symphony," Chen Zi et al.'s opera "Spring Thunder," Qu Xixian's "Red Army Base Chorus," An Bo's opera "Monument," Li Jiefu's opera "Spark," Shi Lemeng's "Long March Chorus," and Wang Yunjie's "War of Resistance Against Japan Symphony," Yan Ke et al.'s opera "Five Red Clouds"—these are all songs praising revolutionary history; Chen Zi et al.'s opera "Liu Hulan," Zhang Wengang's "Flying Tiger Mountain Chorus," Lu Yuan et al.'s dance drama "Immortal Warrior," Shi Lemeng's "Huang Jiguang Chorus," Huang Ge et al.'s opera "Dong Cunrui," Zhang Rui et al.'s opera "Red Glow"—these are all songs praising people's heroes; Luo Zongxian et al.'s opera "Song of the Prairie," Xiang Zeng et al.'s dance drama "Loulan Girl"—these are songs praising national unity; in addition, there is Ma Ke et al.'s comic opera "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," which writes about the contradictions between the old and the new, and works based on folk legends, such as Shi Yongkang's symphonic poem "The Story of the Yellow Crane," Zhang Xiaohu et al.'s dance drama "Baolian Lantern," He Zhanhao et al.'s violin concerto named after Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, etc. Of course, in addition to these, there are some very meaningful works that we cannot list one by one.
    As you can see, in large-scale works, those with revolutionary history and heroic figures as their themes account for a considerable proportion. These works shape some major events and heroic figures in people's revolutionary struggles into vivid musical images, leave them in people's memories, and encourage people to dedicate themselves to building a better future with greater enthusiasm.
    The increasing number of large-scale works shows the increase in our country's creative power, and also means the improvement of creative skills. Although some works still lack higher generalization and cannot fully utilize the strengths of large-scale works, develop dramatic contradictions, and make a more in-depth depiction of the spiritual outlook of events and characters, or have not been able to effectively combine national melodies and symphonic techniques, some works still feel that they have not boldly broken through the limitations of folk music themes, and some works lack revolutionary romanticism. But everyone tries hard to pay attention to finding characteristic materials from national music to express modern life, and strives to make the created image conform to the reality of life. All of these are worthy of our attention. Here, we must also mention that many of the authors of large-scale works are newly emerging talents, and ethnic minorities have also begun to produce some talented young composers, such as Zheng Zhenyu of the Korean ethnic group, Deboxifu of the Mongolian ethnic group, and Yu Sanjiang of the Uighur ethnic group, who have all grown up in the past decade, which cannot but make us excited about the rapid development of the music culture of these ethnic minorities.
    If some composers cannot freely use large forms to express broad life, in smaller forms, especially in songs, many composers can freely choose various themes and use various genres to express various different lives from various angles; some more experienced composers have gradually formed their own unique styles.
    In terms of songs, the past decade has produced those that are familiar to everyone: "Singing the Motherland," "People of the World Are of One Mind," "Chinese People's Volunteers Battle Song," "The Sun Rises on the Prairie," "The Liberated Era," "Singing the Erlang Mountain," and also produced "Exploration Team Song," "Glorious Military Dependent Wang Daniang," "Please Stay, Guests from Afar," "Flowers Bloom on Both Sides of the Huai River," "I Am a Soldier," "Bayonet Song," "Logging Song," "Osmanthus Blooms, Happiness Comes," etc. In recent years, "Socialism is Good," "Great Leap Forward Songs Shake the Mountains and Rivers," "People's Commune is Good," "My Motherland," "We Are Red Youths," and also produced "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Village," "It's Really Fun to Death," "Sergeant's Letter," "Now We Use Baskets to Carry Songs," "Where Did the Old Peddler Come From," "Yakexi," "Praise the Three Armies," in addition, "Little River Flows," "Pastoral Song," "Osmanthus Blooms, Happiness Comes" and other lyrical songs and lyrical choruses adapted from folk songs.
    In terms of small instrumental pieces, the past decade, especially in recent years, has produced more folk-style pieces, such as Ding Shande's "Children's Suite," Sang Tong's "Seven Pieces on Eastern Mongolian Folk Song Themes," Jiang Zuxin's "Temple Fair," Su Xia's "Northern Jiangsu Suite," Chen Peixun's "Spring Thoughts," Liu Zhuang's "Variations," Zhu Jian'er's "Theme and Variations," Guo Zhihong's "Xinjiang Dance" (all of the above are piano pieces), Ma Sicong's "Mountain Song," Li Guoquan's "Fishermen's Song at Dusk," Sha Hankun's "Pastoral Song," Mao Yuan's "New Spring Music," Jin Yanping's "Third Dance," Qin Yongcheng's "Love Song" (all of the above are violin pieces), Zheng solo "Celebrating the Harvest" adapted by Zhao Yuzhai, Yangqin solo "On the Miluo River" adapted by Wang Yifu, Flute solo "Shepherd's Flute" by Liu Chi and Liu Sen, Qin solo "Xinjiang is Good" adapted by Wu Jinglue, Ethnic orchestra ensemble "Little Mill" adapted by Yang Jieming, etc.
    The Formation of a New Style
    From these works with different themes and genres, we can easily see some common characteristics. The composers breathe the fragrance emanating from the life of building socialism together with the people, so they can give the audience a fresh feeling. Whether it is joy, hope, or fantasy, it grows from the soil of people's lives and is beautiful. Although the composers have different educations and different creative methods, everyone is striving to create a novel and expressive style that is easy for the people to understand on the basis of national melodies. Although everyone's understanding of life is basically the same, everyone strives to pursue and create a unique style according to different themes, and truthfully reflect the life of this era from various aspects. We already have some composers who can give their works a unique style. With the continuous development of the entire creative practice, especially as composers have a deeper understanding of the spiritual life of the people and a more in-depth study of the tradition of national music, and draw more lessons from the advanced music of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and world classical works, many of our composers will definitely form their own unique styles and be able to create new national characteristics.
    The Development of Opera Music
    Opera music reform work, although it cannot be regarded as musical creation, but some of it is very meaningful creative work, whether in the development and reform of singing styles, or in the reform and development of orchestra accompaniment, is of creative significance. Some local operas have already begun to use duets and choruses, and many local operas have already used multi-part accompaniment, which is obviously adapted to the creative form of opera music. In recent years, especially after opposing those crude methods that completely deviate from tradition, great achievements have been made in music reform, such as Henan Opera's "Chaoyang Ditch," Hua Opera's "Golden Wan Hairpin," Kun Opera's "Red Glow," and Yue Opera's "Dream of the Red Chamber," which are very significant examples. These successful examples show that music workers have a further understanding of the laws of opera music, and a greater understanding of the people's lives in the old era and the aesthetic viewpoints of the broad masses of people today. The reason why music reform is of great significance to opera is mainly because this reform has enabled opera to start on a new road. That is to say, it will no longer be as limited by many conditions in the past, and sometimes even making do with whatever is available; of course, we do not deny that it has found extremely economical and effective artistic methods under extremely difficult conditions, which is still worth learning in this respect; now that there are favorable conditions, of course, it can also remove some of the shortcomings of making do with whatever is available, and find more expressive forms. The new development of opera must undoubtedly be based on its own laws, but at the same time, it must also meet the requirements of this era. Today's reform has enabled us to see its higher development in the future. As long as opera musicians continue to improve their ideological level and professional level, and cooperate closely with actors and musicians, they will definitely be able to reform opera music to better meet the people's growing appreciation level, and further develop the excellent tradition of opera music, so that opera music is more perfect.
    In addition, although our film music creation, song and dance music creation, military music creation, light music creation, and acrobatics music creation have only ten years or even less than ten years of history, they have all achieved significant results, which will not be discussed one by one here.
    Several Basic Experiences
    Under the guidance of the Party's correct policy, my country's musical creation has achieved great development in the ten years since the founding of the country, mainly because composers have a further understanding of life, research on the national musical heritage, and learning from foreign music. In 1956, the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Later, with the emergence of the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism was put forward in literary and artistic creation, which has an unparalleled driving force for developing musical creation and improving the level of musical creation. However, according to the requirements of the Party for creating a new socialist national culture, we should create a new socialist and national music culture, which requires us to continue to make great efforts. Some comrades often fail to understand the great significance of the "music should serve politics," "music workers must go deep into the life of the masses," "inherit the national musical heritage," "learn from foreign music," and "must implement the policy of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend'" emphasized by the Party for the development of music culture. Here, based on our experience over the past decade, a brief narrative is provided, let us review it again, which may not be useless to our work.
　　Serving Politics Improves the Quality of Musical Creation
    We openly advocate that music, like other arts, must serve politics, but some people still harbor doubts about this view, as if there really exists in the world a kind of music that does not serve any politics, as analyzed by a bourgeois music theory propagandist in our country. In fact, this question is very clear. Can a warrior in a class society have two personalities? Can he say something here that defends the interests of his class, and then say something elsewhere that does not defend the interests of his class? Stalin once correctly analyzed that "the superstructure is produced by the foundation, but this does not mean that the superstructure only reflects the foundation, only passively, neutrally, indifferent to the fate of its foundation, the fate of the class, and the nature of the system. On the contrary, once the superstructure appears, it will become a very great positive force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its own foundation, and taking all measures to help the new system destroy and eliminate the old foundation and the old class." More than two thousand years ago, our country's music theorists also said similar things. It is said in "The Record of Music" that "rituals, music, punishment, and politics are all the same, so they unite the people's hearts and come out of the way of governing." The question is not whether music should serve politics, but what politics it should serve. We advocate that music should serve the people's politics, the revolutionary politics, and the socialist communist politics, because socialism and communism are the most progressive political ideas of mankind today, and the socialist system and even the future communist system are the most progressive social systems in the history of mankind.
    Chinese music workers have followed the Party's instructions and struggled against all erroneous bourgeois ideas that do not advocate serving politics, so they have achieved great success and created many excellent works. This is because every revolutionary or progressive musician believes that he should serve politics, always feels honored that his creation can serve socialism, socialist construction, and the working people of socialist construction, and is always willing to do his best to write better and perform better works, because they believe that they should contribute the greatest strength and the best works and best performances to the working people who are building socialism. This idea has become the main reason for the increasing prosperity of our country's music creation and performing arts. In this way, we can understand why since the Great Leap Forward movement last year, we have been able to produce many good works, and we can also understand why serving politics will not only not reduce the quality of works, but on the contrary, can improve the quality of works. Obviously, if there is no idea of serving politics, we would not have many revolutionary musicians such as Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, Zhang Shu, and Ren Guang, nor would we have patriotic and democratic Liu Tianhua and Huang Zi; there would be no "March of the Volunteers" and all the national salvation songs, nor would there be the anti-Japanese war songs and all the music of the liberated areas, such as the "Yellow River Cantata" and "Northern Shaanxi Suite." , there would be no progressive and revolutionary music in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
    "Serving politics" is the basic guideline for guiding the forward development of socialist music culture. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the tremendous development of music culture has fully proved the correctness of this guideline. Of course, some people have a narrow understanding of music serving politics, thinking that serving politics does not require lyrical music, humorous songs, and light music, and thinking that there is no need for lyrical poems describing natural scenery and imaginative music describing beautiful folk legends, which is a misunderstanding of music serving politics, and we do not approve of it.
    Going Deep into the Life of the Masses is Not a Touristic Glimpse
    Our music reflects real life. They reflect the increasingly broad lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers from various angles and to varying degrees. It should be said that we are active and successful in studying and experiencing the life of the masses, but it cannot be denied that our research on the life of the masses is still insufficient. Some comrades' understanding of life is not very clear, which requires us to continue to further solve in future practice.
    Many people feel that, as reflected in some works, many composers' lives have not been fully and deeply integrated with the lives of the working people, and the emotions expressed in the works are not so clear and strong, and cannot meet the requirements of the broad masses to a greater extent. Of course, some of this is obviously because the author lacks sufficient skills to express the ideas and feelings they experienced from the life of the masses in a concentrated and vivid manner; but it cannot be denied that many situations are because the author has certain skills, but the experience of the life of the masses is not deep, and has not yet been integrated with the masses in terms of thoughts and feelings, so in the works, it cannot be done to express both the author's own thoughts and emotions, and at the same time summarize the thoughts and emotions of the broad masses.
    Some of our composers do not have a deep understanding of the glorious title of people's composer. They think that as long as they write some works that reflect real life, it seems that it does not matter whether the thoughts and feelings expressed in the works are of the broad masses, and even such questions arise: Why can't I express my own thoughts and feelings? Am I not also a member of the people? He did not understand that we do not oppose composers expressing their own thoughts and feelings, because we know very well that only when writers are moved by life can they enter the creative process. They must express their own thoughts and feelings. The question is whether the composer's feelings about life are the same as the thoughts and feelings of the broad working people. Whether the musical image he creates and the thoughts and emotions he expresses are familiar to, understood by, and accepted by the broad masses, and whether they can meet their requirements. In a word, whether the composer and the broad masses of people are unified in thoughts and feelings, and whether they speak the words in their hearts on behalf of the millions of masses in their works. We believe that only composers who truly represent the millions of masses in their creations and are accepted by the millions of masses can obtain the glorious title of people's composer. Many great names in music history have proved this truth. Therefore, the Party always earnestly advises us to go deep into the life of the masses and be a people's musician, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only, the broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all literary and artistic raw materials, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." To put this instruction into practice, it cannot be achieved by a touristic glimpse. We must carry out comprehensive, meticulous, and arduous work. The Party instructed us to participate in labor training, mainly for the purpose of establishing correct labor views through participation in labor and fundamentally changing our relationship with the working people. This is of great practical significance for us to study the life of the masses in depth and transform our own thoughts and feelings.
    We must continue to move forward on the basis of the past ten years and continue to go deep into life. But we do not think that we must first transform ourselves and completely obtain the thoughts and feelings of millions of people before we can start creating. That is also wrong and impossible. Only by constantly going deep into life, constantly transforming ourselves, and constantly creating in the process of creative practice can we completely solve this problem.
    Inheriting and Developing the Popularity and Nationality of the National Musical Heritage
    In the past ten years, due to the music community's repeated criticism of bourgeois ideas that ignored the national musical heritage, especially after everyone had a relatively in-depth contact with various styles of national musical heritage with a strong atmosphere of life, everyone began to have a new understanding of the national musical heritage and began to pay attention to it. I felt that not only could I learn many useful things from it, but I was also deeply moved by these simple and moving sounds, and I got many inspirations and inspirations from it; therefore, the musical creation in recent years has undergone fundamental changes from the past. Music that completely deviates from the national melody is not easy to hear today, and almost every composer has adapted some folk songs more or less. Folk songs of various ethnic minorities have aroused great interest from everyone, and many musical creations have obviously been influenced by these folk songs. The heroic ode "Gada Meilin" symphony poem written by the young composer and praised by everyone was written based on the folk songs of the Mongolian ethnic group. Many popular instrumental pieces almost all choose folk tunes as themes, and those works that are not developed based on a certain folk tune are also related to folk tunes. This is a significant and gratifying change in musical creation in the past decade.
    However, some comrades' views on the purpose of inheriting the national musical heritage are not very clear. We believe that the purpose of inheriting the national musical heritage is to inherit and develop the popularity and nationality reflected in the national musical heritage, promote it in our own creation, and create a new socialist national music culture of our era.
    Some composers have not realized this, at least, their works do not show that they have such an attempt. Their understanding of the purpose of learning folk music is not deep. They think that learning the national musical heritage is the purpose itself, or that adapting folk songs is the only method. It is undeniable that adapting folk songs can help us conduct a deeper study of the national musical heritage, which is a necessary method, but we cannot be limited to this kind of work. We also do not approve of taking a method similar to compilation to develop folk music, because that kind of method cannot develop folk music, it can only make folk music weak, because folk music is mainly not developed through this method, it is mainly digested the music of the predecessors, absorbed its essence (not swallowed whole, nor cut off the head and tail), and re-created from life. In real life, songs adapted on the basis of old lyrical songs and humorous songs have emerged, which are welcomed by the broad masses. It should be affirmed that this work is meaningful. On the basis of these experiences, new lyrical songs and humorous songs can be developed, but special attention must be paid to eliminating the feudal dross. Some songs now show our tolerance for certain vulgar tendencies, which is worthy of our attention.
    The experience of the past decade has made us realize that following the Party's instructions and inheriting the national musical heritage has a good influence on the development of musical creation, not only has it gained a strong national color in appearance, but also, because it has inherited the popularity and nationality of national music to varying degrees, it has made music have a higher sense of life reality. Of course, we must continue to move forward, and we must create socialist music with higher nationality and popularity, and express the great working people who have created a new life.
    Learning from Foreign Music, Overcoming Dogmatism
    Developing a new socialist national music culture is by no means only about inheriting the national musical heritage. At the same time, we must also learn from foreign music, because the development of the music culture of any nation is not isolated. It is bound to exchange with the music culture of other nations and other countries, and exchange will inevitably promote the development of each other's music culture. Comrade Mao Zedong once instructed us, "It (referring to the new democratic culture) unites with the socialist culture and new democratic culture of all other nations, establishes a relationship of mutual absorption and mutual development, and jointly forms a new world culture; but it must never unite with the imperialist reactionary culture of any other nation, because our culture is a revolutionary national culture." In the ten years since liberation, we have followed the Party's instructions, and while criticizing the bourgeois blind worship of Western music, we have launched a study of the experience of music construction in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, which has had a beneficial influence on the development and improvement of our country's music culture.
    Our country has always paid attention to absorbing the advantages of foreign culture, but in the period from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement, due to the interweaving of the national independence movement of the broad masses of people and the bourgeois democratic revolution struggle, the ideological struggle was very fierce, which was reflected in culture, and there were many divergent opinions on developing our country's new culture. At that time, some bourgeois cultural figures advocated fully accepting Western culture to replace our own culture. In music, some bourgeois musicians also advocated fully accepting Western music. Those who advocated "complete Westernization" were completely ignorant of Chinese music, and their understanding of Western music was also very one-sided, so they planted many evil results in music theory. They not only promoted the theory that "Western music is advanced and Chinese music is backward," but also promoted "music has nothing to do with politics," "music is only form and never expresses any content," "the only standard for measuring music is technology," "music has no borders, no national distinctions, only good and bad," and so on. The spread of these ideas laid the foundation for the blind worship of Western music and the contempt for national music, and these erroneous views not only hindered us from treating the national musical heritage with a correct attitude, but also hindered us from treating Western music correctly. Until before liberation, the minds of many musicians were filled with these erroneous bourgeois musical ideas. But the Party has long had the correct policy on how to treat foreign culture. Chairman Mao pointed out in his classic work "On New Democracy" written in 1940, "But everything foreign, like our food, must be chewed through our own mouths and stomachs, sent into saliva gastric juice intestinal juice, and broken down into two parts, essence and dross, and then discharged the dross and absorbed the essence, in order to be beneficial to our body. It is absolutely impossible to absorb it raw without criticism. The so-called 'complete Westernization' is a wrong point of view." This is very clear, to absorb foreign things, must be digested. In 1942, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out again that "Therefore, we must never refuse to inherit and learn from the ancients and foreigners, even those of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. But inheritance and learning can never become a substitute for our own creation, which can never be replaced." These correct instructions helped us end the debate that lasted for more than half a century and have great guiding significance for the development of our new socialist national culture.
    After liberation, we deeply studied some of Comrade Mao Zedong's classic works in this regard, and our thoughts have greatly improved. Many people have a correct understanding of Western music. However, there are still a small number of people in higher music colleges who still lack a correct understanding even today. They think that since it is emphasized that learning foreign music must be learned well and thoroughly, there is no need to consider the situation in our country, nor is there any need to combine it with the development of our country's music culture. It should be moved over as is. And they believe that what should be learned is only Western classical music, and they are not willing to learn about the music and music construction experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. What they worship is actually only the form and technology of Western European music whose living content has been castrated by bourgeois views.
    In addition, some people still have doubts about learning foreign music. They worry that learning too much will destroy our national music tradition and will lead to dogmatism. The facts of the past decade have answered these comrades' doubts. We have learned foreign music, but we have not destroyed the national music tradition, but we have developed the national music tradition. National music has been enriched by various forms and genres, and the popularity and nationality of the national music heritage have been given higher play on a broader road. Our entire musical creation and entire performing arts not only have a certain ideological level, but also have a certain artistic level; they not only have certain modern techniques, but also have certain national characteristics. Isn't this obvious proof? Of course, in learning foreign music, some dogmatic errors have occurred in creation, performance, and music theory research. This error still exists now and will still exist in the future. But this is not the fault of learning foreign music, it is just an error that occurs due to treating learning foreign music with a dogmatic attitude. This error must be constantly overcome in the process of practice. We cannot not learn or oppose learning foreign music because we are afraid that someone will commit dogmatism. What we want to oppose is learning foreign music with a dogmatic point of view.
    In the past decade, most musicians have been able to conduct specific analysis of Western classical music based on Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, so they have established a correct attitude towards foreign music, had a clear purpose in learning foreign music, and the learning attitude and learning methods have also fundamentally changed, so they have achieved significant results and have truly played a role in learning for the development of our new socialist national music culture.
    "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a Guideline for Promoting Artistic Development and Scientific Progress
    The Party instructs us that "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is a guideline for promoting artistic development and scientific progress. Facts have proved that this guideline has played an inestimable role in the development of our country's culture and art. We have gained the following experiences in implementing this guideline in music work.
    The flourishing and development of music art must first adapt to the widespread needs of the working people of workers, peasants, and soldiers. All art can only flourish if it first meets the needs of the broad masses, and the development achieved on the basis of meeting the needs of the masses is the development we require. In a word, prosperity and development cannot be separated from the people. The lives of the broad masses of people in the socialist era are as broad as the ocean, and their requirements for music are also diverse. Therefore, to meet their requirements, we must first create musical works with different themes, genres, forms, and styles. If it is not a hundred flowers blooming, the various different requirements of the masses cannot be met.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1942: "We encourage revolutionary writers and artists to actively be close to workers, peasants, and soldiers, give them complete freedom to go to the masses, and give them complete freedom to create truly revolutionary literature and art." In our country, composers and performers fully enjoy this freedom. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" further encourages everyone to create freely based on the practice of people's lives. Everyone believes that it is not required that everyone be unified in one creative method, and they can freely choose in terms of themes, genres, forms, and styles. This can develop the personality of composers and performers and the different strengths of each in artistic creation, and it also helps composers and performers find the most suitable creative path and artistic style for themselves in artistic practice and in the process of combining with the masses. In this way, music art can achieve higher development and greater prosperity. On this basis, we will definitely be able to create the newest and most beautiful musical images of mankind, so that our country's music can stand out from the crowd and be different from the music of all other countries in the world. As for some people who want to use "letting a hundred flowers bloom" to peddle poisonous weeds, there is nothing terrible about that, because these poisonous weeds, after discussion and criticism, can only be used as negative teaching materials and cannot cause any harm to the increasingly prosperous socialist music culture of the people. On the contrary, it has further improved people's ability to distinguish.
    Under the guidance of the "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" guideline, music theory research work has achieved great achievements in the past few years. Under the leadership of the Party, we have launched a debate on major issues of right and wrong with the right-wing elements throughout the country, and we have also launched widespread discussions and criticisms on the bourgeois reactionary yellow music that once flooded certain cities. Discussions and criticisms have been launched on certain bourgeois viewpoints in music history, and how to implement "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in musical performances, develop lyrical songs and humorous songs, and sort out certain vulgar tendencies expressed in folk music have also been discussed, as well as how to correctly carry out the socialist singing movement. Through these theoretical activities, our political level and ideological level have been improved, and the victory of the socialist music line has been guaranteed. The more in-depth the analysis and the clearer the viewpoints, the more correct the solution to various problems in music theory through discussion.
    Continue to Move Forward and Push to New Heights
    In the past decade, great development has also been achieved in musical performance and music theory research. Obviously, this article cannot discuss them separately, but from the following specific examples, a general overview can be obtained. Since last year, performers from the Central Orchestra, the Central Experimental Opera House, and many other performing units have also participated in labor training in factories and rural areas with the spirit of leaping forward, and have given many performances for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This year, they have also staged many new musical works from our country, and have also introduced Soviet composer Shostakovich's historically significant Eleventh Symphony, Metus's "Young Guard" (opera), and the world-renowned Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which is full of enthusiasm and hope and always inspires progressive mankind all over the world with majestic tones to fight for peace and light, to the people of our country. These not only show their spirit of leaping forward, but they have also indeed made many efforts, overcome many technical difficulties, and improved the level of performance. The efforts made by everyone in theoretical research are also exciting. The "History of Ancient Chinese Music" and "History of Modern Music" collectively written by the Central National Music Research Institute and the Central Conservatory of Music, and the "History of Modern Music" written by teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, although they have not yet been finalized, are based on its scale, material selection, and viewpoints. Seen from the perspective, they are incomparable to any music history in the past. They all try to make a comprehensive analysis of ancient, modern, and modern music history from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, which is unprecedented in the history of music science in our country. Their work has advanced the history of music science in our country by a big step. Although the right-wing elements once slandered the Party for not understanding music and being unable to lead the music industry, and believed that the music industry had not achieved any development since liberation. That is only because the bourgeois reactionary and decadent music cannot be developed, which has aroused their hatred, which just shows their hostility to the increasingly developing socialist music industry, so they slander, slander, and attack, but the socialist music industry is developing forward on an incomparably grand scale and with incomparably huge steps.
    Our country's music culture is a component of our country's new socialist national culture, and under the correct leadership of the Party, it has embarked on a bright and broad road. Some of the achievements we have made today only show that we have a good start. We must constantly improve our ideological level and artistic level under the leadership of the Party, constantly struggle against various non-working-class musical ideas, and with the leaping development of the entire socialist construction cause, push our country's music culture to a new peak, and form a brilliant component in the new world music culture jointly formed by the music culture of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

　　社会主义的民族的新音乐的成长
　　吕骥
    音乐创作的繁荣
    十年来，由于社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设的迅速发展，已经在很大程度上改变了旧中国落后的面貌。由于生产关系的根本改变，人与人之间已经建立了完全新的关系，不再是人压迫人，人剥削人了；旧的阶级观念失去了它的物质基础，因此旧的道德观念、旧的理性标准、旧的审美观点不能不被新的代替了。新的社会关系和新的生活，就产生了新的道德观念、新的理性标准和新的审美观点。
    音乐，作为社会主义艺术的一个组成部分，随着新的精神生活的成长，迅速地在改变自己的面貌，可以说，社会主义的音乐正是反映了我国人民精神生活的巨大变化，特别是反映了新的精神面貌的成长，因而获得更加强大的精神力量；新的风格愈益鲜明，在现实生活中，就愈能得到发展和繁荣。
    社会主义革命、社会主义建设和保卫社会主义建设而进行的各种斗争所取得的胜利，保证了我国社会主义建设的发展，也为我国文化艺术展开了一幅完全新的、辽阔而壮丽的前景，使我们看到这个时代真正是伟大而富于诗意的时代。生活中到处可以看到激动人心的创造，到处可以看到新事物对旧事物的胜利，这就不可能不引起我们音乐工作者许多新的感受，大家也不可能不在自己的创作中把这些新的感受表现出来。新的生活的成长，无疑地就是我们音乐工作向前发展的最大的动力。十年来，我们不仅看到音乐创作的迅速成长，表演水平的提高，也看到音乐理论研究工作的发展；特别是去年大跃进运动以来，各方面工作蓬勃地发展，十分令人兴奋；许多青年音乐家所作出的成绩，尤其值得我们高兴。
    创作力量的成长和创作的繁荣是十分显著的，就大合唱、歌剧、舞剧、交响诗、交响乐等大型作品来看，更加清楚。去年以前，大型创作的数量不是很多的，有些方面几乎是空白点；去年以来，情况有了很大的变化，不仅创作了许多大合唱、歌剧，也创作了许多交响乐作品和舞剧。十年来，大家所熟知的，表现了我们这个时代的，我们就可以举出如下这些作品：马思聪的“山林之歌”交响乐、李焕之的“节日序曲”交响组曲、时乐蒙的“祖国万岁”大合唱、李劫夫的“胜利花开遍地红”联唱、郑镇玉的“长白山大合唱”、肖白等人的“幸福河大合唱”、陆浩林等人的“人民公社好”大合唱，这是歌颂祖国、歌颂胜利、歌颂新生活的；罗忠熔的“十三陵水库交响序曲”、贺绿汀的“十三陵水库大合唱”、瞿希贤的“三门峡大合唱”、谢功成的“长江大桥大合唱”、马思聪的“淮河大合唱”和张鲁的“锁龙潭”大合唱，这是歌唱我国社会主义建设的；瞿维的“人民英雄纪念碑交响乐”、罗忠熔的“第一交响乐”、陈紫等人的歌剧“春雷”、瞿希贤的“红军根据地大合唱”、安波的歌剧“纪念碑”、李劫夫的歌剧“星星之火”、时乐蒙的“长征大合唱”和王云阶的“抗日战争交响乐”、彦克等人的歌剧“五朵红云”，这都是歌颂革命历史的；陈紫等人的歌剧“刘胡兰”、张文纲的“飞虎山大合唱”、陆原等人的舞剧“不朽的战士”、时乐蒙的“黄继光大合唱”、黄歌等人的歌剧“董存瑞”、张锐等人的歌剧“红霞”，这都是歌颂人民英雄的；罗宗贤等人的歌剧“草原之歌”、翔曾等人的舞剧“蒌拉姑娘”，是歌颂民族团结的；此外，还有马可等人写新旧矛盾的喜歌剧“小二黑结婚”，以民间传说为题材的，如施咏康的交响诗“黄鹤的故事”、张啸虎等人写的舞剧“宝莲灯”、何占豪等人写的以梁山伯与祝英台命名的小提琴协奏曲等等。当然，除此以外，还有一些很有意义的作品，我们无法一一列举。
    大家可以看得出来，在大型作品中，以革命历史和英雄人物为题材的占了相当大的比例。这些作品，把人们革命斗争中的一些重大事件和英雄人物塑造成鲜明的音乐形象，留在人们记忆中，鼓舞着人们以更大的热情为建设更美好的未来而献身。
    大型作品越来越多地产生，显示了我国创作力量的增涨，同时也意味着创作技巧的提高。虽然目前有的作品还缺乏更高的概括力，还不能充分运用大型作品的长处，发展戏剧性的矛盾，对事件和人物的精神面貌作更深刻的描绘，或者还没有能够把民族音调和交响性手法很有效地结合起来，有些作品还令人觉得没有大胆地突破民间音乐主题的限制性，有些作品或者还缺乏革命的浪漫主义因素；但大家竭力注意从民族音乐中寻找富有特性的材料，用来表现现代生活，而且力求所创造的形象符合于生活的真实，这些都是值得我们重视的。这里我们也不能不说到，许多大型作品的作者都是初露才华的新生力量，兄弟民族也开始出现了一些有才能的青年作曲家，如朝鲜族的郑镇玉、蒙古族的德伯希夫、维吾尔族的于三江等，他们都是这十年中成长起来的，不能不使我们为这些兄弟民族的音乐文化的迅速发展而感到兴奋。
    如果说，有一些作曲家还不能自由地运用大形式来表现广阔的生活的话，在较小的形式方面，特别是歌曲方面，许多作曲家就能够随心所欲地选用多方面的题材，运用各种体裁，从各个角度去表现各种不同的生活；一些较有经验的作曲家并且逐渐形成了自己独特的风格。
    歌曲方面，十年来产生了大家所熟知的：“歌唱祖国”、“全世界人民心一条”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”、“解放了的时代”、“歌唱二郎山”，也产生了“勘探队之歌”、“光荣军属王大娘”、“远方客人请你留下来”、“淮河两岸鲜花开”、“我是一个兵”、“刺刀歌”、“采伐歌”、“桂花开、幸福来”，等等，近几年来，产生了“社会主义好”、“大跃进歌声震山河”、“人民公社好”、“我的祖国”、“我们是红色青年”，也产生了“毛主席来咱农村”、“真是乐死人”、“上士的信”、“如今唱歌用箩装”、“哪儿来了个老货郎”、“亚克西”、“赞三军”，此外，也还产生了“小河淌水”、“牧歌”、“桂花开、幸福来”这一些根据民歌改编的抒情歌曲和抒情合唱曲。
    小型器乐曲方面，十年来，特别是近几年来，产生了较多的风俗性小品，如丁善德的“儿童组曲”、桑桐的“东蒙民歌主题小曲”七首、蒋祖馨的“庙会”、苏夏的“苏北组曲”、陈培熏的“思春”、刘庄的“变奏曲”、朱践耳的“主题及变奏”、郭志鸿的“新疆舞曲”（以上均系钢琴曲），马思聪的“山歌”、黎国荃的“渔舟唱晚”、沙汗昆的“牧歌”、茅沅的“新春乐”、靳延平的“第三舞曲”、秦泳诚的“情歌”（以上均系小提琴曲），赵玉斋改编的筝独奏曲“庆丰收”、王沂甫改编的洋琴独奏曲“汨罗江上”、刘炽、刘森的笛子独奏曲“牧笛”、吴景略改编的琴独奏曲“新疆好”、杨洁明改编的民族乐队合奏曲“小磨坊”等。
    新风格的形成
    从这些题材不同、体裁不同的作品中，我们不难看出一些共同的特点，作曲者和人民一同呼吸着从建设社会主义的生活中所散放出来的芬芳，因此能够给听众以新鲜感受，不管是喜悦，是希望，还是幻想，都是从人民生活土壤中生长出来的，而且是优美的。尽管作曲者所受的教养不同，创作方法不同，大家都在努力追求在民族音调的基础上，创造一种新颖而富于表现力、又容易为人民理解的风格，却是相同的。尽管大家对于生活的理解基本上是一致的，大家却努力根据不同的题材追寻创造独特的格调，从各个侧面真实地反映这个时代的生活。我们已经有一些作曲家能够赋予他们的作品以独特的风貌，随着整个创作实践不断向前发展，特别是作曲家对于人民的精神生活有了更深的理解，对于我国民族音乐传统更深入的研究，从苏联及其他社会主义国家的先进音乐和世界古典作品中取得更多的借鉴以后，我们的许多作曲家一定都会形成自己的独特风格的，而且能够创造出新的民族特点。
    戏曲音乐的发展
    戏曲音乐改革工作，虽然不能看作是音乐创作，但其中有一部分很有意义的创作工作，不论在唱腔的发展和改革，不论是乐队伴奏的改革和发展，都是有创作意义的，有些地方戏曲中已经开始采用了二重唱、合唱，许多地方戏曲都已经用了多声部的伴奏，这些显然是适应戏曲音乐的创作形态的。近几年来，特别是经过反对那些完全脱离传统的粗暴作法以后，音乐改革中取得了很大的成就，如豫剧的“朝阳沟”、华剧的“金琬钗”、昆曲的“红霞”、越剧的“红楼梦”，都是非常显著的例子。这些成功的例子说明了音乐工作者对于戏曲音乐的规律有了进一步的认识，对于旧时代的人民生活和今天的广大人民的审美观点有了更多的理解。音乐改革对于戏曲之所以具有重要意义，主要在于这个改革使戏曲开始在新的道路上出发了。这就是说，将不再像过去由于受了许多条件的限制，有些时候甚至于是因陋就简；当然，我们也不否认，它在极端困难的条件下，也找到了极其经济而又有效的艺术方法，这一方面还是值得我们学习的；今后既有了优厚的条件，当然也就可以去掉某些因陋就简的缺点，找到更富有表现力的形式。戏曲的新的发展，无疑地，必须根据自己的规律，但同时也要符合这个时代的要求。今天的改革已经使我们看到它将来更高的发展，只要戏曲音乐家不断提高自己的思想水平和业务水平，密切和演员、乐师合作，一定能够把戏曲音乐改革得更加符合于人民日益发展的欣赏水平，更加发挥了戏曲音乐的优秀传统，使戏曲音乐更加完美。
    此外，我们在电影音乐创作上、歌舞音乐创作上、军乐等创作上、轻音乐创作上、杂技音乐创作上虽然都只有十年或者还不到十年的历史，但都取得了显著的成绩，这里就不一一论述了。
    几条基本经验
    我国音乐创作，在党的正确方针指导下，在建国十年中，得到了很大的发展，主要由于作曲家对于生活的理解，对于民族音乐遗产的研究，对于学习外国音乐都有了进一步的理解。在1956年党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，后来随着生产大跃进形势的出现，在文艺创作上，提出了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，对于发展音乐创作、提高音乐创作水平都具有无比的推动力量。但根据党所提出的创造社会主义的民族的新文化的要求，我们应该创造社会主义的、民族的新音乐文化，就需要我们继续作很大的努力。有些同志常常不能了解党所强调的“音乐要为政治服务”、“音乐工作者必须深入群众生活”、“要继承民族音乐遗产”、“要向外国音乐借鉴”、“必须贯彻‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’的方针”对于发展音乐文化的巨大意义，这里根据我们十年来的经验，略加叙述，让我们再温习一遍，对我们的工作也许不会是无益的。
　　为政治服务提高了音乐创作质量
    我们是公开主张音乐和其他艺术一样，必须为政治服务的，可是有些人对于这个观点仍然保留着怀疑，好像世界上真正存在着一种不为任何政治服务的音乐，像我国的一位资产阶级音乐理论宣传家所分析的那样。其实，这个问题很明白，一个阶级社会中的战士，可以有两重人格么？能够在这里说的是维护本阶级利益的话，在另一个地方却又说些不维护本阶级利益的话么？斯大林曾经正确地分析过，“上层建筑是由基础产生的，但这决不是说上层建筑只是反映基础，只是消极的，中立的，对自己基础的命运、对阶级的命运、对制度的性质漠不关心的。相反地，上层建筑一出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固，采取一切办法帮助新制度来摧毁和消灭旧基础与旧阶级。”我国两千多年以前的音乐理论家也讲过相似的道理，“乐记”中说过，“礼、乐、刑、政，其极一也，所以同民心而出治道也”，问题不是音乐要不要为政治服务，而是为什么政治服务。我们是主张音乐要为人民的政治、为革命的政治、为社会主义共产主义的政治服务的，因为社会主义、共产主义是今天人类最进步的政治思想，社会主义制度以至将来的共产主义制度是人类历史上最进步的社会制度。
    我国音乐工作者遵循着党的指示，和一切不主张为政治服务的错误的资产阶级思想进行了斗争，因此获得了很大的成绩，创造了许多优秀的作品。这是因为每一个革命的或进步的音乐家都认为应该为政治服务，总是把自己的创作能够为社会主义、为社会主义建设、为社会主义建设的劳动人民服务而感到光荣，总是愿意以最大的努力把作品写得更好，表演得更好，因为他们认为对建设社会主义的劳动人民应该贡献最大的力量，贡献最好的作品和最好的表演。这个思想就成为我国音乐创作、表演艺术日益繁荣的主要原因。这样，我们就可以理解为什么去年大跃进运动以来，我们能够产生了许多好作品，也就可以理解为什么为政治服务不仅不会降低作品的质量，相反能够提高作品的质量。很明显，如果没有为政治服务的思想的话，我们就没有聂耳、冼星海、张曙、任光等许多革命音乐家，也没有爱国的民主的刘天华、黄自；就没有“义勇军进行曲”和所有的救亡歌曲，也不会有抗战歌曲和所有解放区的音乐，像“黄河大合唱”、“陕北组曲”这些作品，也就没有国统区进步的音乐和革命的音乐了。
    “为政治服务”是指导社会主义音乐文化向前发展的基本方针。建国以来，音乐文化的巨大发展完全证明了这个方针的正确。当然有的人对于音乐为政治服务作了狭窄的理解，以为为政治服务就不需要抒情音乐、诙谐歌曲、轻音乐，以为就不需要描写自然景色的抒情诗和描写美丽的民间传说的富于幻想的音乐，那是对于音乐为政治服务的误解，那是我们所不赞成的。
    深入群众生活不是旅行式地走马看花
    我们的音乐是反映现实生活的。它们从各个角度、在不同的程度上，反映了工农兵日益广阔的生活，应该说我们在研究群众生活、体验群众生活上是积极的，也是有成绩的，但不能否认，我们对群众生活的研究还很不够，有些同志对生活的理解并不是非常明确的，要求我们在今后的实践中继续进一步解决。
    许多人觉得，从一些作品反映出来，许多作曲家的生活还没有完全和劳动人民的生活深刻地结合起来，作品中表现的情绪还不是那么鲜明、强烈，还不能在更大程度上满足广大群众的要求。固然，这里面有些显然是由于作者缺乏足够的技巧，不能够把他们从群众生活中体验来的思想感情集中地、生动地表现出来；但不能否认，许多情况是由于作者虽有一定的技巧，可是对群众生活体验不深，还没有在思想感情上同群众打成一片，因此在作品中还不能做到既表现了作者自己的思想情绪，同时又概括了广大群众的思想情绪。
    我们有的作曲家对于人民作曲家这个光荣的称号理解不深，以为只要写些反映现实生活的作品就行了，好像作品中所表现的思想感情是不是广大群众的并没有什么重要，而且甚至于发生这样的疑问，为什么不能表现我自己的思想感情呢？我不也是人民中的一员么？他没有理解，我们并不反对作曲家表现自己的思想感情，因为我们知道得很清楚，只有作家被生活感动了，才能进入创作，他必须表现自己的思想感情，问题是在于作曲者对于生活的感受是否和广大劳动人民的思想感情相同，他所创造的音乐形象，所表达的思想情绪是否为广大群众所熟悉、所能理解，所能接受，能否满足他们的要求。一句话，就是作曲家和广大人民群众在思想感情上是否统一了，是否在作品中代表千百万群众说出了心里的话。我们以为只有在创作上真正代表了千百万群众，又为千百万群众接受了的作曲家才能取得人民作曲家这个光荣的称号，音乐史上许多伟大的名字都证明了这个道理。所以党总是谆谆劝告我们，要我们深入到群众生活中去，作一个人民音乐家，如毛泽东同志所指出的：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”要实践这个指示，决不是旅行式地走马观花所能达到的，必须进行多方面、细致的艰苦的工作。党指示要我们参加劳动锻炼，主要目的是通过参加劳动，树立正确的劳动观点，根本改变我们和劳动人民的关系。这对于我们深入研究群众生活，改造自己的思想感情具有很大的实际意义。
    我们必须在过去十年的基础上继续前进，继续深入生活。但我们并不以为必须先改造好了，完全获得了千百万群众思想感情之后，才能动手创作。那也是不对的，也不可能。只有在创作实践过程中不断深入生活，不断改造自己，不断地创造，才能彻底解决这个问题。
    继承与发展民族音乐遗产的人民性和民族性
    近十年来，由于音乐界反复批判了忽视民族音乐遗产的资产阶级思想，特别是大家在比较深入地接触了各种不同风格的、有着强烈的生活气息的民族音乐遗产以后，大家对民族音乐遗产开始有了新的理解，开始重视起来，觉得不仅从其中可以学到许多有益的东西，而且深深地被这些朴素的、震动人心的声音所激动了，从它得到许多启示和灵感；所以这几年来的音乐创作同过去有着根本性的改变，那种完全脱离民族音调的音乐，今天已经不大容易听到了，而且几乎每一个作曲者都或多或少地改编过一些民歌。各兄弟民族的民歌更引起了大家很大的兴趣，许多音乐创作显然受了这些民歌的影响，为大家所赞扬的青年作曲家所写的英雄颂歌“嘎达梅林”交响诗就是根据蒙古族的民歌而写成的。许多受到欢迎的器乐曲几乎都是选取民间曲调作为主题，那些不是根据某一民间曲调而发展的作品，也都与民间曲调有着联系。这是十年来音乐创作上一个显著的可喜的改变。
    不过继承民族音乐遗产的目的究竟是为什么，有些同志的看法是不很明确的。我们认为继承民族音乐遗产的目的在于继承与发展民族音乐遗产中所体现的人民性和民族性，在自己的创作中加以发扬，创造出我们这个时代的社会主义的民族的新音乐文化。
    有一部分作曲家却没有认识到这一点，至少，从他们的作品中还看不出他们有这样的企图。他们对学习民间音乐的目的理解不深，以为学习民族音乐遗产本身就是目的，或者以为改编民歌就是唯一的方法。不可否认，改编民歌能够帮助我们对于民族音乐遗产进行较深入的学习，是一种必要的方式，但我们不能局限在这一种工作上。我们也不赞成采取类似集曲的办法去发展民间音乐，因为那种作法并不能发展民间音乐，只能使得民间音乐走向贫弱，因为民间音乐主要不是经过这种方法发展起来的，主要是消化了前人的音乐，吸收其菁华（不是生吞活剥，也不是切头去尾），从生活中再创造。在实际生活中，出现了在旧的抒情歌曲和诙谐歌曲基础上改编的歌曲，受到广大群众的欢迎，应该肯定，这个工作是有意义的，在这些经验的基础上，可以发展新的抒情歌曲和诙谐歌曲，但是必须特别注意剔除其中的封建糟粕。现在有些歌曲表现了我们对于某些庸俗倾向的容忍，这是值得我们注意的。
    十年来的经验使我们认识了遵循党的指示、继承民族音乐遗产对发展音乐创作有良好的影响，不仅在外貌上获得了浓厚的民族色彩，由于在不同程度上继承了民族音乐的人民性与民族性，使音乐具有更高的生活真实感。当然，我们还要继续前进，要创造民族性与人民性更高的社会主义的音乐，表现创造了新生活的伟大的劳动人民。
    借鉴外国音乐，克服教条主义
    发展社会主义的民族的新音乐文化决不是只要继承民族音乐遗产就行了，同时还必须向外国音乐借鉴，因为任何一个民族的音乐文化的发展都不是孤立的，必然要和别的民族别的国家的音乐文化发生交流，交流必然能够促进彼此的音乐文化的发展。毛泽东同志曾经指示我们，“它（指新民主主义文化）同一切别的民族的社会主义文化和新民主主义文化相联合，建立互相吸收和互相发展的关系，共同形成世界的新文化；但是决不能和任何别的民族的帝国主义反动文化相联合，因为我们的文化是革命的民族文化。”解放以后十年来，我们遵循了党的指示，在批判资产阶级盲目崇拜西洋音乐的同时，展开了对苏联及其他社会主义国家的音乐建设经验的学习，对我国音乐文化的发展和提高起了有益的影响。
    我国从来就是注意吸收外国文化的长处的，但从鸦片战争以后到五四运动前的这一段时期中，由于广大人民群众的民族独立运动和资产阶级民主革命斗争交织在一起，思想斗争十分激烈，反映在文化上，对于发展我国新的文化有许多纷歧的意见，当时，有一部分资产阶级文化人，主张全盘接受西洋文化以代替我国自己的文化。音乐上，也有一些资产阶级音乐家，主张完全接受西洋音乐，这些主张“全盘西化”的人对中国音乐完全无知，对于西洋音乐的认识也是非常片面的，因此在音乐理论上种下了许多恶果。他们不仅宣传“西洋音乐进步、中国音乐落后”的理论，也宣传了“音乐与政治无关”、“音乐只是形式，从来不表现任何内容”、“衡量音乐的标准，技术是唯一的”、“音乐是没有国界的，也没有民族的区别，只有好坏之分”，等等，这样一些资产阶级观点。这些思想的泛滥，就为盲目崇拜西洋音乐，轻视民族音乐这种思想打下了基础，这些错误观点不仅阻碍了我们以正确态度对待民族音乐遗产，同时也阻碍了我们正确地对待西洋音乐。一直到解放前，在许多音乐家头脑中充满着这些错误的资产阶级音乐思想。但是党对于如何对待外国文化，早就有了正确的方针。毛主席在1940年写的“新民主主义论”这部经典著作中曾经指出过，“但是一切外国的东西，如同我们对于食物一样，必须经过自己的口腔咀嚼和胃肠运动，送进唾液胃液肠液，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华，才能对我们的身体有益，决不能生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。所谓‘全盘西化’的主张，乃是一种错误的观点。”这里说得非常明确，吸收外国的东西，必须经过消化。1942年，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”又指出了“所以我们决不可拒绝继承和借鉴古人和外国人，那怕是封建阶级和资产阶级的东西。但是继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。”这些正确的指示帮助我们结束了长达半个世纪以上的争论，对发展我国社会主义的民族的新文化具有巨大的指导意义。
    解放以后，我们深入地学习了毛泽东同志这方面的一些经典著作，思想有了很大的提高，许多人对于西洋音乐已经有了正确的认识。但高等音乐院校里也还有一小部分人，一直到今天也还缺乏正确认识，以为既然强调学习外国音乐必须学好学透，就不需要考虑我国的情况，也不需要与我国音乐文化的发展相结合，就应该原封不动地搬过来再说；而且他们认为应该学的只是西洋古典音乐，对于苏联和其他社会主义国家的音乐和音乐建设的经验他们倒并不愿意学习。他们所崇拜的其实只是以资产阶级观点所看到的生活内容被阉割了的西欧音乐的形式和技术。
    另外，也有人对于学习外国音乐还存怀疑态度，他们耽心学得太多会破坏我们民族音乐传统，会产生教条主义；十年来的事实已经答复了这些同志的怀疑，我们学了外国音乐，并没有破坏民族音乐传统，不过发展了民族音乐传统。民族音乐被用各种形式、各种体裁所丰富了，民族音乐遗产的人民性和民族性在更广阔的道路上得到了更高的发挥。我们的全部音乐创作和全部表演艺术既具有一定的思想水平，也具有一定的艺术水平；既具有一定的现代技巧，也具有一定的民族特点，不是很明显的证明么？当然，在学习外国音乐时，不论在创作上、表演上、音乐理论研究上曾经出现过某些教条主义的错误，这种错误现在也还有，将来也还会有。但这不是学习外国音乐之过，这只是以教条主义态度对待学习外国音乐而发生的错误。这种错误在实践过程中是必须不断克服的，我们不能因为害怕有人犯教条主义而不学习或者反对学习外国音乐，我们要反对的是以教条主义观点学习外国音乐。
    十年来，大多数音乐家对西洋古典音乐能够根据马克思列宁主义观点进行具体分析，因此对待外国音乐树立了正确态度，学习外国音乐有了明确的目的，学习态度和学习方法也从根本改变了，这样就获得了显著的成绩，对发展我国社会主义的民族的新音乐文化真正起了借鉴的作用。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针
    党指示我们，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，事实证明了这个方针对发展我国文化艺术起了不可估量的作用。我们在音乐工作中贯彻这个方针，得到了如下一些体会。
    音乐艺术的繁荣发展，首先要适应工农兵劳动人民广泛的需要，一切艺术只有首先满足了广大群众的需要，才能繁荣，也只有在满足群众需要的基础上得到的发展，才是我们所要求的发展。一句话，繁荣和发展都不能脱离人民群众。社会主义时代广大人民群众的生活像海洋一样宽广，对音乐的要求也是多方面的，因此要满足他们的要求，首先要创作不同题材、不同体裁、不同形式、不同风格的音乐作品，如果不是百花齐放的话，群众各种不同的要求是得不到满足的。
    毛泽东同志早在1942年就指出了：“我们鼓励革命文艺家积极地亲近工农兵，给他们以到群众中去的完全自由，给他们以创作真正革命文艺的完全自由。”在我们国家内，作曲家和表演家完全享有这种自由。“百花齐放”更加鼓舞了大家根据人民生活实践自由创作的热情，大家认为不要求大家统一于一种创作方法，在题材、体裁、形式、风格上都能够自由选择，这样就能够发展作曲家和表演家的个性和各人在艺术创作上不同的长处，也就帮助了作曲家和表演家在艺术实践中，在和群众的结合过程中找到最适合于自己的创作道路和艺术风格；这样也就能够使音乐艺术达到更高的发展和更盛的繁荣。在这个基础上，一定能创造出人类最新最美的音乐形象，使我国音乐独树一帜，区别于世界其他各国的音乐。至于有些人想利用“百花齐放”来贩卖毒草，那也没有什么可怕，因为这些毒草经过讨论和批评，它们只能作为反面教材，丝毫不能对于人民的日益繁荣的社会主义音乐文化发生什么毒害作用，相反，更提高了人们的鉴别能力。
    音乐理论研究工作在“百家争鸣”的方针指导下，几年来获得巨大成就，我们在党的领导下，在全国范围内，和右派分子展开了大是大非的辩论，对资产阶级反动的黄色音乐在某些城市一度泛滥，也展开了广泛的讨论和批判，对音乐史上某些资产阶级观点开展了讨论和批评，也讨论了音乐表演上如何贯彻“百花齐放”和发展抒情歌曲、诙谐歌曲，以及整理民间音乐中所表现的某些庸俗倾向，也讨论了如何正确地开展社会主义歌唱运动，通过这些理论活动提高了我们的政治水平和思想水平，也保证了社会主义音乐路线的胜利。音乐理论上的各种问题通过讨论，分析愈深刻，观点愈明确，问题的解决也愈正确。
    继续前进，推向新的高峰
    音乐表演和音乐理论研究方面，十年来同样取得了巨大发展，这篇文章显然不可能分别加以论述，但从下面几个具体事例，可以概见一般。中央乐团和中央实验歌剧院和许多其他演出单位的表演家，去年以来，同样以跃进精神到工厂农村参加劳动锻炼，为工农群众作了许多演出，今年又上演了许多我国新的音乐作品，还为我国人民介绍苏联作曲家肖斯塔可维奇的有历史意义的第十一交响乐，梅图斯的“青年近卫军”（歌剧）和举世知名的、充满热情和希望、永远以雄伟的音调鼓舞着全世界进步人类为和平和光明而斗争的贝多芬的第九交响乐。这些不仅表现了他们的跃进精神，而且也的确作了许多努力，克服了许多技术上的困难，提高了表演水平。理论研究方面大家所作的努力也是令人兴奋的，中央民族音乐研究所和中央音乐学院集体撰写的“中国古代音乐史”和“近代音乐史”、上海音乐学院师生撰写的“现代音乐史”，虽然都还没有最后定稿，但从它的规模、取材和观点来看，都是过去任何一部音乐史所不能比拟的，他们都试图以马克思列宁主义观点对古代、近代、现代音乐史作全面的分析，这在我国音乐历史科学上都是空前的，他们的工作把我国音乐历史科学向前推进了一大步。尽管右派分子曾经污蔑党不懂得音乐，不能领导音乐事业，认为解放以后音乐事业没有得到什么发展。那只是因为资产阶级的反动、堕落的音乐得不到发展，因而引起了他们的仇恨，正说明了他们对于日益发展的社会主义音乐事业的敌视，因而进行污蔑、诽谤、攻击，社会主义音乐事业却以无比宏大的规模、无比巨大的脚步向前发展了。
    我国的音乐文化是我国社会主义的民族的新文化的一个组成部分，在党的正确领导下已经走上了一条光辉而广阔的道路。我们今天所取得的一些成就只说明了我们有一个良好的开端，我们一定要在党的领导下，不断提高思想水平和艺术水平，不断地和各种非工人阶级的音乐思想进行斗争，随着整个社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，把我国的音乐文化推向一个新的高峰，在以苏联为首的社会主义国家的音乐文化共同形成的世界新音乐文化中成为一个光辉的组成部分。
