Erect Banners, Promote Advanced Experiences
Beijing's 35,000 Mechanical and Electrical Workers Hold Grand Meeting

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China jointly convened the Beijing Municipal Mechanical and Electrical Industry System Advanced Experience Exchange Conference on the 22nd at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, introducing advanced technologies in turning, fitting, planing, casting, forging, and other trades, as well as advanced experiences in enterprise management, to 35,000 employees.
    The advanced producers who introduced their experiences at the meeting included Ni Zhifu, a fitter from Yongding Machinery Factory who created the "Ni Zhifu drill," Gui Yupeng, a young lathe operator from Beijing People's Machinery Factory who has achieved 497 technical innovations since last year, and Dai Fengchen, leader of the sand casting team at Changxindian Communications Factory, whose product qualification rate has remained at 100% for the past ten years, totaling 29 people.
    This advanced experience exchange conference is the beginning of a series of activities that Beijing is preparing to hold in the near future to promote advanced experiences. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that leaders of all factories and mines should make cultivating and establishing advanced banners and promoting advanced experiences one of the main tasks of leading industrial production in the future. In the near future, the city will promote the advanced experiences of 42 advanced collectives and advanced producers according to industry and type of work. The methods are: 1. Hold on-site meetings, organize workers and cadres of the same type of work to visit the site and discuss. Each unit puts forward a learning plan, and the leading organs check the learning and promotion situation according to the plan; 2. Organize advanced technology observation teams to take turns imparting experience to various units, or send people from various units to advanced units to "study as apprentices." Ensure that they learn well and never give up halfway; 3. Run technical training classes, where advanced producers systematically teach their own experience, and the relevant industrial trade unions are responsible for promotion; 4. Sign inter-factory advanced technology mutual teaching contracts to carry out inter-factory collaborative competitions with learning advanced experience as the main content. The contract content includes mutual teaching and learning projects, methods, and time. Whether the obligations stipulated in the contract have been fulfilled will be used as one of the competition conditions, with regular inspections to urge implementation.
    In order to regularize the work of establishing advanced banners, promoting advanced experiences, and carrying out mass activities of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, the Beijing Municipal Committee has also determined that in the monthly and quarterly competitions and evaluations in the future, all factories and mines and enterprises should not only report on the completion of national plans, but also report on how many advanced figures have emerged, how many advanced experiences have been promoted, and what the effect of implementation is. The effect of promoting advanced experiences will also be used as one of the competition and evaluation conditions.
    In the upsurge of continuing the Great Leap Forward this year, more than 7,700 advanced collectives and nearly 60,000 advanced producers have emerged in Beijing's factories and mines, and advanced experiences and technological innovations are emerging in an endless stream. After discovering these advanced experiences, industrial trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, and factories and mines immediately appointed special personnel or formed working groups to carefully summarize them and promote them. Experience exchange and promotion activities between factories, workshops, and work processes are very frequent, and the number of projects for promoting advanced experiences is also increasing. According to preliminary statistics from seven industrial sectors, including metallurgy, electricity, machinery, textiles, and printing, more than 540 major advanced experiences have been promoted in the past five months. After the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant promoted the experience of the "dual-drive" shock brigade for automation and mechanization in the painting section of the accessories workshop, a technical innovation craze was launched among the youth of the entire plant. From August 21 to September 10, 507 technical innovations were proposed, and 321 were implemented. Once these advanced experiences blossomed and bore fruit among the masses, production efficiency increased sharply, and the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, quickly pushing the production movement to a new climax.

    树立旗帜  推广先进经验
    北京三万五千机电职工举行大会
    本报讯　北京市机电工业局和中国第一机械工会北京市委员会，22日在北京市劳动人民文化宫联合召集北京市机电工业系统的先进经验交流大会，向三万五千名职工介绍车、钳、刨、铸、锻等工种的先进技术和企业管理方面的先进经验。
    在会上介绍经验的先进生产者，有创造“倪志福钻头”的永定机械厂钳工倪志福，去年以来实现了四百九十七项革新技术的北京人民机器厂青年车工桂育鹏，十年来产品合格率一直保持百分之百的长辛店通信工厂翻砂组长戴凤臣等共二十九人。
    这次经验交流大会，是北京市准备在最近期间举行的一系列推广先进经验活动的开始。中共北京市委决定，今后各个厂矿领导方面要把培养和树立先进旗帜和推广先进经验，作为今后领导工业生产的主要工作之一。全市在最近期间将按产业、工种推广四十二名先进集体和先进生产者的先进经验，办法是：一、召开现场会议，组织同工种的工人、干部到现场参观，讨论。各单位提出学习计划，领导机关按计划检查学习推广情况；二、组织先进技术观摩队，轮流到各单位传授经验，或由各单位派人到先进单位“就师、留学”。做到教会学好，决不半途而废。三、举办技工训练班，由先进生产者系统地讲授自己的经验，由有关产业工会负责推广。四、签订厂际先进技术互教合同，开展以学习先进经验为内容的厂际协作竞赛。合同内容包括互教互学项目、方法和时间，是否完成合同规定的义务，作为竞赛条件之一，定期检查，督促实现。
    为了使树立先进旗帜、推广先进经验、开展群众性的比先进、学先进、赶先进工作经常化，北京市委还确定今后每月、每季竞赛评比时，各厂矿、企业不仅要报告国家计划完成情况，而且要报告出现多少先进人物，推广多少先进经验，实现效果如何。并把推广先进经验的效果，作为竞赛评比条件之一。
    在今年继续大跃进的高潮中，北京各厂矿涌现出七千七百多个先进集体和近六万个先进生产者，先进经验和技术革新层出不穷。产业工会、共青团组织和厂矿发现这些先进经验后，即指派专人或组成工作组认真进行总结，加以推广。各厂矿、车间、工序之间的经验交流、推广活动十分频繁，推广先进经验的项目也日益繁多。仅据冶金、电业、机械、纺织、印刷等七个产业部门的初步统计，五个月来推广较重大的先进经验达五百四十多项。北京汽车制造厂推广了附件车间镀漆工段自动化、机械化的“双化”突击队不断革新的经验后，全厂青年就掀起技术革新的热潮，从8月21日到9月10日就提出技术革新五百零七项，实现了三百二十一项。这些先进经验一旦在群众中开花结果后，生产效率猛增，群众干劲更足，迅即把生产运动推向新的高潮。
