Xinhua News Agency, London, October 10th: The results of the British general election held on the 8th have been announced. In the 630 seats in the House of Commons, the Conservative Party won 365 seats and will continue to govern, the Labour Party won 258 seats, and the small Liberal Party won 6 seats. One seat remains to be counted.

In the previous House of Commons, the Conservative Party had only 59 more seats than the Labour Party, but now it has more than 100 more seats.

When analyzing the election results, the London Observer summarized the voters' psychology by saying, "If there is little difference between the two parties, why bother to change?" The words of an old British female voter also reflect that the general voters have long seen through this two-party game. When a television reporter handed her a microphone and asked her to comment on the election, she disdainfully said, "I don't want to help either of these two parties. Whichever party comes to power, they are all big liars."

Agence France-Presse reporter Roby commented on the election results, saying that the election results "bring as many problems to the winners as they do to the losers."

Xinhua News Agency, London, October 10th: The Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement yesterday on the results of the British general election. The statement pointed out that the reason for the Conservative Party's victory was not due to its strength, but due to the weakness of the Labour Party's policies.

The statement said, "Labour has not been an effective opposition party in Parliament in the past, and has not taken action to lead the people outside Parliament. Therefore, the Conservative Party was able to avoid defeat."

The statement pointed out that the right-wing policies of the Labour Party, represented by Gaitskell, abandoned the goal of socialism and did not answer or expose the Conservative Party's policies on the rearmament of West Germany, NATO, the Cold War, the arms race, and the use of hydrogen bombs. The Labour leaders agreed with the Conservative Party on these issues. Because they supported huge armament plans and refused to challenge the big capitalists, they could only propose the most moderate social reform plans.

The Labour Party's abandonment of socialist goals has disappointed many of its most active supporters. Therefore, the responsibility for the Conservative Party's victory should be attributed to the right-wing policies of the Labour Party leadership.

The statement pointed out that the Conservative Party's victory in the election will embolden the British bourgeoisie to launch larger-scale attacks on workers and trade unions. The election results will also benefit those who want to continue the arms race and the Cold War.

The statement called on all forces in the workers' movement to unite and fight as a response to the Conservative Party's victory in the election.

### 英国大选结果揭晓保守党继续执政  英共号召加强团结进行斗争

　　英国大选结果揭晓保守党继续执政
    英共号召加强团结进行斗争
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：8日举行的英国大选结果已经揭晓，在下院六百三十个席位中，保守党获得三百六十五席而继续执政，工党获得二百五十八席，小党派自由党获得六席。另有一席尚待统计。
    在上一届的下院中，保守党只比工党多五十九席，而现在则多了一百多席。
    伦敦观察家在分析选举结果时综述选民投票的心理说，“如果两党之间很少有区别，那何必要更换呢？”英国一个选民老太太的话也反应出一般选民早已看透了这种两党戏。当一个电视记者把扩音器递给她要她对选举发表意见时，她鄙夷地说，“对这两个政党我都不愿帮忙，不论哪一个党的政府上台，都是大骗特骗。”
    法新社记者洛比评论选举结果时说，选举的结果“给获胜者带来的问题同给失败者带来的问题同样多”。
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国共产党政治委员会昨天就英国大选结果发表声明。声明指出，保守党所以获胜并不是由于它有力量，而是由于工党政策的软弱。
    声明说，“工党过去在议会中没有成为一个有效的反对党，没有采取行动来领导议会外边的人民。因此，保守党得以免遭失败。
    声明指出，以盖茨克尔为代表的工党的右翼政策抛弃了社会主义的目标，而且没有答复或者揭露保守党对西德重新武装以及北大西洋公约组织、冷战、军备竞赛和使用氢弹等方面的政策。工党领袖在这些问题上同意保守党的看法。由于他们支持庞大的武装计划和拒绝向大资本家挑战，他们只能提出最温和的社会改良计划。
    由于工党放弃了社会主义的目标而使它的许多最积极的支持者感到扫兴。因此，使保守党获胜的责任应归于工党领导的右翼政策。
    声明指出，保守党在大选中获胜，这将使英国的资产阶级敢于对工人和工会发动更大规模的进攻。选举的结果也将使那些想继续进行军备竞赛和冷战的人得势。
    声明号召工人运动中的一切力量团结起来进行战斗，作为对保守党在大选中获胜的回答。
