I have seen many versions of "Legend of the White Snake" in various opera genres, but this time, seeing the Sichuan Opera "Legend of the White Snake" performed by the Sichuan Provincial Youth Sichuan Opera Troupe, I still had a refreshing feeling. Their performance has a unique style. Some "Legend of the White Snake" versions have a heavier lyrical component, while this "Legend of the White Snake" focuses on depicting struggle. When Wang the Taoist's talisman is broken by the White Snake with her finger blood, after comforting Xu Xian and telling him to go down to eat, she immediately orders Xiao Qing to capture Wang the Taoist, tie him to a high pole, and give him a beating, until this guy who destroys other people's happy lives cries and begs for mercy. This shows the White Snake's brightness, straightforwardness, and very untamed personality. Of course, she is very gentle and considerate in front of Xu Xian. Xu Xian offers her wine, and she reluctantly, against her own will (how much she fears the smell of realgar!), drinks it. This kind of kind, feminine feeling is touching. Many opera genres carefully describe her attachment and affection in a lyrical style, while in Sichuan Opera, the positive depiction of love is not emphasized much, but focuses on depicting her courage in fighting to protect her happy life with Xu Xian. From her desperate struggle, we see how much she cherishes the freedom and love she has just gained. When she struggles hard with Fahai but cannot win, Xiao Qing suggests flooding Jinshan Temple, and she blurts out: "I'm afraid of drowning your uncle!" This stroke highlights that the description of her brave and resolute struggle is precisely a description of her persistence in love.

You must know that she is not a goddess with high magical powers, but only a demon fairy who knows some wind and rain. Her ability is not enough to guarantee her victory in the face of those ruthless interveners, so her act of escaping to the mortal world and fighting for freedom seems even more pitiful and admirable. Sichuan Opera treats the White Snake as a "doomed soldier," which puts her struggle in a very sympathetic position. Her ability is not even as good as Wang the Taoist's talisman. She has no magic power to break it, and finally has to bite her middle finger and use blood to break it. When flooding Jinshan Temple, Sichuan Opera also depicts her being outnumbered and the disparity in strength. Among those tall, burly, and ferocious-looking heavenly soldiers and generals, she looks so weak and petite, but her courage to fight hard is commendable. Thinking of her revealing her true form after drinking the medicinal wine, and almost losing her life in the realgar array, the audience cannot but understand how much determination she had to flood Jinshan Temple and fight with her back to the wall. In those golden armor, she wears a white plain dress, which looks so pure and noble.

Sichuan Opera's performance is very dynamic, the story progresses quickly, and the layout is compact. The White Snake has just married Xu Xian, and Wang the Taoist immediately comes to spy; she has just broken the talisman and beaten Wang the Taoist, and Xu Xian is tricked to Jinshan Temple, showing that the White Snake's love life is always in the midst of storms and rarely has peaceful moments. Sichuan Opera pays great attention to stage movements, and the stage scheduling is strong and powerful. For example, when the White Snake sees Xu Xian faint, she flips the curtain and rushes out, the curtain flies into the air, and she pounces on Xu Xian, making the audience feel a shock and feel that a major accident has occurred; the several face changes of the cymbal god make people feel that this guy is sinister and unpredictable; the White Snake several times coiled on the Green Snake to peep at Jinshan Temple and was rescued from the water in the water, showing that these two snake demons depend on each other in the array of immortals. This kind of national form of "lifting" in Sichuan Opera dance is rich in variety, and it is closely combined with the plot, expressing the relationship and feelings of the characters. The White Snake is across on the back of Xiao Qing, and is clamped down, it really looks like two snakes are entangled together to escape.

Many actors in the Youth Sichuan Opera Troupe are only eighteen or nineteen years old, and their skills are very good. They can inherit the complex and difficult acting skills of Sichuan Opera in accordance with the strict requirements of the Sichuan Opera style. This is inseparable from the teachers' careful teaching and strict supervision, and it is also inseparable from their hard training, respect for teachers, and especially their high enthusiasm for the Party's drama cause. After watching various "Legend of the White Snake," I can't help but think of the phrase "Let a hundred flowers bloom." For this subject alone, we have beautiful lyrical poems, historical dramas with sharp dramatic conflicts, narrative poems that focus on depicting characters' emotions, and mythical demon legends. In the lively mythical drama of "suddenly gods and ghosts come out, and suddenly demons are revealed," the brave heart of a weak person in that society striving for freedom is highlighted, which gives the audience a good inspiration.

### 风味浓冽的川剧“白蛇传”

    风味浓冽的川剧“白蛇传”
    张真
    各个剧种的“白蛇传”我看过不少了，可是这次看到四川省青年川剧演出团的“白蛇传”，还是有耳目一新的感觉。他们的演出，有独特的风格。有些“白蛇传”抒情成份是较重的，而这个“白蛇传”却侧重在描写斗争。当王老道的灵符被白蛇用指血破掉，安慰许仙厨下去用膳以后，她立即命小青去捉王老道，绑上高杆，一顿拷打，直打得这个破坏别人幸福生活的家伙痛哭求饶。这里显示了白蛇的明快，爽直，很不驯良的性格。当然，在许仙面前她是十分温柔体贴的，许仙劝酒，她委婉地、违反着自己的意志（她多么怕闻雄黄味啊）吃下去了，这种善良的、女性的心情是令人感动的，许多剧种用抒情的笔调仔细描写了她的惓恋多情，而在川剧中，正面的爱情描写，著墨不多，却侧重描写了她为保卫她同许仙的幸福生活而斗争的勇敢，从她的拼命斗争中，我们看见她多么珍重她刚开始获得的自由和爱情。当她奋力同法海搏斗，不能取胜的时候，小青建议水漫金山，她冲口而出说：“犹恐淹坏你家姑爹！”这一笔点明，描写她斗争的勇敢、坚决，恰好是描写了她对爱情的执着。
    要知道她并不是道法高强的女神，只不过是会一些呼风唤雨的妖仙。她的本事并不足以保证她在那些无情的干涉者面前得胜，于是她那逃下凡尘，争取自由的行为，更显得可悯，可敬。川剧这样把白蛇处理为一支“哀兵”，就使她的斗争处在了十分值得同情的地位。她的本事甚至不敌王老道的一张灵符，她没有法力去破，最后只好咬破中指，用血光破了它。水漫金山的时候，川剧也描写她众寡不敌、强弱悬殊，在那些魁梧高大、面貌狰狞的天兵天将中间，她看来是那么荏弱和娇小，但她那硬拼的勇气却是好样的。想起她喝药酒现原形，雄黄阵几乎送了命，观众不能不理解她敢水漫金山是下了多么大的决心，背城一战了。在那些金光闪闪的铠甲丛中，她一身白色的素服，显得那么纯洁和高贵。
    川剧的演出，动作性十分强烈，故事进行迅速，布局紧凑，白蛇刚刚与许仙结成眷属，王老道立刻就来窥伺；刚刚破了灵符，吊打了王老道，许仙就被骗上金山，表现出白蛇的爱情生活，总是在惊涛骇浪中，很少和平宁静的时刻。川剧很讲究舞台动作，舞台调度强烈有力，如白蛇见许仙晕倒，她把帐子一掀蹿出，帐子飞向空中，她一个“窜毛”扑向许仙，使观众精神一震，感到发生了重大事故；铙钹神的几次变脸，让人感觉这家伙阴险莫测；白蛇几次盘在青蛇身上窥探金山寺和在水漫中被救下场，显示了在群仙阵中这两个蛇妖的相依为命。川剧舞蹈中这种民族形式的“托举”是花样丰富的，它紧紧结合了剧情，表现了人物关系和感情，白蛇横跗在小青背后，被夹下场，真像是两条蛇盘绕在一起逃走的形态。
    青年川剧演出团许多演员不过十八九岁，他们的功夫都很好，能够把川剧的复杂、艰难的演技，按照川剧风格的严格要求，继承下来，这与老师傅对他们的悉心教授和严加督促是分不开的，也和他们对自己刻苦锻炼，对老师尊重，尤其对党的戏剧事业的高度热情分不开的。看了形形色色的“白蛇传”，不觉令人想起“百花齐放”这句话来，单是这个题材，我们有优美的抒情诗篇，也有戏剧冲突尖锐的史剧，有偏重人物情感描写的叙事诗，也有神话味浓厚的义妖传，在“倏尔神鬼乱出，忽又妖魔毕露”的热闹的神话戏中间突出了那个社会一个弱小者争取自由的勇敢心灵，使观众得到很好的启示。
