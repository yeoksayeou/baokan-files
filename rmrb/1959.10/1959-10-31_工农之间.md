Between Workers and Peasants
		Wu Lü
	
Using modern technology to equip agriculture is a fascinating theme at the "Heroes' Assembly." At the meeting on the 28th, when Comrade Tan Zhenlin, on behalf of the more than 500 million peasants, congratulated the assembly and requested the working class to provide more and better agricultural machinery for agricultural modernization, and expressed his belief that the national workers would wholeheartedly support the development of agriculture and would meet the requirements of the hundreds of millions of peasant brothers, the entire audience expressed the determination of the Chinese working class to support the great development of agriculture with long and enthusiastic applause.

Realizing the technical transformation of agriculture is the strong desire of 500 million peasants and also the strong desire of more than 30 million workers and staff. Although industry and agriculture are two different production sectors, workers and peasants are close brothers who share weal and woe in socialist construction. They have formed a great alliance in the revolutionary struggle, and they have been encouraging and supporting each other in economic construction. Industry and agriculture are two indispensable legs of the national economy. The development of industry needs the support of agriculture. Not only does the food workers eat come from the countryside, the industrial labor force comes from the countryside, and most of the raw materials for light industry come from the countryside, and the countryside is an important market for light industry, but also the countryside is an important market for heavy industry. Experience in recent years has proved that when agriculture has a bumper harvest in the previous year and agriculture has a relatively large development, the industrial production in the next year will inevitably have a relatively large increase. This is because after agricultural harvests, industry has raw materials and markets, which promotes the development of industry. Conversely, when agricultural development is slow in the previous year, industrial production in the next year will not grow quickly. The technical transformation of agriculture will further greatly promote the development of industry, especially the development of heavy industry, such as steel, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various machinery and equipment used in rural areas. This is one aspect.

On the other hand, the development of agriculture requires the support of industry. The completion of agricultural cooperation, especially the realization of people's communes, has opened up broad roads for the development of agricultural productive forces in our country, enabling our agricultural production to be greatly developed. However, under the conditions that agriculture in our country is still basically using manual tools, the continued maintenance of faster growth in agricultural production will always be limited to a certain extent, and the improvement of agricultural labor productivity cannot be very fast. In this case, agricultural support for industry also has certain limits. Only by accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, arming agriculture with modern technology, and realizing the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, can agriculture develop faster, provide more food for cities, provide more raw materials for industry, free up more labor to support industry, and the rural market can accommodate more industrial products, especially heavy industrial products. To arm agriculture with modern technology and realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture requires the full support of industry.

The development of industry needs agricultural support, and the development of agriculture needs industrial support. The relationship between industry and agriculture is also a relationship of unity of opposites. Especially in a large country like ours with a backward economy, the development of industry is inseparable from agriculture. Experience has proved that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development in our country. The Party's proposal to combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and to implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, reflects the close relationship between industry and agriculture in our country, and is an important policy for continuing to develop our national economy at a high speed.

The guarantee of the working class is the most powerful guarantee. The applause in the Great Hall of the People will be transformed into material strength, into the sound of large tractors driving to the fields, and into a powerful action to actively and gradually promote the technical transformation of agriculture!

    工农之间

    工业要以现代技术武装农业，这是“群英会”上一个引人入胜的主题。28日的大会上，当谭震林同志代表五亿多农民向大会祝贺，要求工人阶级为农业现代化提供更多更好的农业机械，并且表示相信全国工人一定会以全力来支援农业的发展，一定会满足五亿几千万农民兄弟的要求时，全场以久久不息的热烈的掌声，表示了中国工人阶级支援农业大发展的决心。
    实现农业的技术改造，是五亿农民的强烈愿望，也是三千多万职工的强烈愿望。工业和农业虽然是两个不同的生产部门，但在社会主义建设中，工人和农民却是同呼吸，共命运的亲兄弟。他们在革命斗争中结成了伟大的同盟，在经济建设中也一直互相鼓舞，互相支援。工业和农业是国民经济缺一不可的两条腿。工业的发展需要农业的支援。不仅工人吃的粮食来自农村，工业劳动力来自农村，轻工业的原料绝大部分来自农村，农村是轻工业的重要市场，而且农村也是重工业的重要市场。几年来的经验证明，当上一个年度农业丰收，农业有了比较大的发展以后，下一个年度的工业生产必然会有一个比较大的增长。这是因为农业丰收以后，工业有了原料，有了市场，推动了工业的发展。反之，当上一年度农业发展比较慢时，下一个年度的工业生产也就增长得不快。而农业的技术改造，又将进一步大大促进工业的发展，特别是重工业的发展，如钢铁、农业机械、化肥、农药、以及各种农村用的机械设备。这是一方面。
    另一方面，农业的发展又需要工业的支援，农业合作化的完成，特别是人民公社化的实现，已经为我国农业生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路，使我国农业生产得到极大的发展。但是，在我国农业基本上仍然是使用手工工具的条件下，农业生产继续保持以更快的速度增长总会受到一定限制的，农业劳动生产率的提高也不可能是很快的。在这种情况下，农业对工业的支援也就有一定的限度。只有加速农业的技术改造，用现代技术把农业武装起来，实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，农业才能更快地发展起来，为城市提供更多的粮食，为工业提供更多的原料，才能腾出更多的劳动力来支援工业，农村市场也才能容纳更多的工业产品，特别是重工业产品。而用现代技术把农业武装起来，实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，就需要工业全力支援。
    工业的发展需要农业支援，农业的发展又需要工业支援。工业和农业的关系也是一种对立统一的关系。特别是在我国这样经济落后的大国里，工业的发展更离不开农业，经验证明在我国农业是国民经济发展的基础。党提出的必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，反映了我国工业和农业之间的密切相连的关系，是一个使我国国民经济继续以高速度发展的重要的方针。
    工人阶级的保证是最有力量的保证。人民大会堂里的掌声，将变为物质的力量，变为大队拖拉机开向田野的声音，变为积极地逐步地促进农业技术改造的强大行动！
