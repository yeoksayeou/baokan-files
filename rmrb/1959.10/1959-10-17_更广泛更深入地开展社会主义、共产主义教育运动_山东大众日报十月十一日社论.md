The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are a great call to a new victorious march, and a driving force to encourage the masses to achieve continued leap forward this year and complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. Since the publication of the communique and resolutions, Party committees at all levels in the province have, at the fastest speed and in various forms, carried out extensive and in-depth publicity, and launched a mass upsurge of studying and discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, enabling the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the masses in the province to receive a profound socialist and communist education.

Inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, a warm atmosphere of enthusiasm and joy appeared throughout the province, from cities to villages, from industrial and mining enterprises to people's communes, and a new upsurge of a large-scale increase production and practice economy movement was launched with the force of overturning the mountains and seas. On the basis of the continued leap forward in the first eight months of this year, all fronts achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in September. Industrial production soared and progressed rapidly. Steel production reached more than 27,000 tons, with an average daily output increase of 62.4% compared with August; pig iron production reached more than 169,000 tons, with an average daily output increase of 51% compared with August; raw coal production reached more than 2,060,000 tons, with an average daily output increase of 25% compared with August. In addition, the production of machine tools, motors, etc., has also increased greatly. From January to September this year, our province produced more than 125,000 tons of steel, an increase of 3.42 times compared with the same period last year; produced 980,000 tons of pig iron, an increase of more than 11 times compared with the same period last year; and produced more than 15,960,000 tons of raw coal, an increase of 1.09 times compared with the same period last year. The production of daily necessities not only basically restored the varieties of the same period last year, but also increased 1,698 new varieties, so as to better meet the needs of people's lives. New changes have also taken place in the vast rural areas, where enthusiasm is soaring and red flags are waving everywhere. After the bumper harvest of early autumn crops, good news of bumper harvests of late autumn crops has been reported one after another, and the harvest is fast and good; wheat sowing is not only fast, but also of high quality. As of now, nearly 50 million mu have been sown, which is four times faster than the same period last year. Deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting have all greatly exceeded last autumn, and many areas have also realized furrowed fields. The people's communes are continuing to move forward along the road of consolidation and improvement, and are increasingly showing their superiority and strong vitality. On the commercial front, major victories have also been achieved. The province has overfulfilled the grain requisition task of early autumn crops, and the market situation has greatly improved. Cultural, educational, health, science, sports and other work are also striding forward on the premise of serving politics and combining with production. In short, the current situation is very good, and the enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly high. As some areas have described: "The masses have risen at the sound of the wind, the activists are elated, and the production outlook has been completely renewed." This fully proves that the most resolute and rapid publicity and implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly refuting rightism, and boosting morale are the fundamental guarantee and powerful driving force for promoting the continued leap forward of various tasks, setting off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, and completing the national economic plan ahead of schedule and in excess this year, and is the general program and soul for doing all work well.

At present, after the victorious conclusion of the three-level cadre meetings, various regions are adopting the method of combining internal and external party, branch education and mass propaganda to carry out the publicity and implementation of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution among the broad grassroots cadres, party members, and the masses, so as to push the increase production and practice economy movement to a greater climax and achieve greater results. More extensive and in-depth publicity and implementation of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution among the broad cadres, party members, and the masses will surely become a large-scale socialist and communist education movement and rectification movement. Through this movement, hold even higher the victorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, thoroughly refute rightism, boost morale, advance victoriously, and forge ahead courageously; thoroughly draw a clear line between the socialist and capitalist roads, further overcome the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of a few wealthy peasants, and firmly establish the belief in taking the path of communization; straighten out the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance, urban-rural mutual assistance, and actively supporting national construction, and overcome the departmentalism, individualism, and selfishness of some cadres and the masses who only care about the collective and disregard the state, or only care about the individual and disregard the collective and the state; firmly establish the correct attitude of believing in the collective, relying on the collective, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. In this way, not only can the ideological influence of right-leaning opportunists be better eliminated, leaving them with no foothold, but also the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad cadres, party members, and the masses can be greatly improved, and greater enthusiasm can be boosted to complete the various combat tasks put forward by the provincial party committee with higher revolutionary enthusiasm: on the industrial front, ensure the completion of the annual industrial production plan half a month ahead of schedule; on the agricultural front, plant enough and well 70 million mu of wheat, harvest the late autumn crops well, and launch a winter production upsurge centered on water, fertilizer, and soil at the right time; on the financial and trade front, complete the requisition task of 7 billion jin of grain and other agricultural and sideline product procurement plans. Therefore, in the in-depth publicity and implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, there should not be any complacency or views that are opposed to the current work, but on the basis of what has already been achieved, launch a broader and deeper socialist and communist education movement centered on publicizing the Eighth Plenary Session resolutions, and further launch and organize a new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement, carry out a labor competition centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and closely combine the completion of the leap forward plan for industrial and agricultural production and the procurement plan for by-products, so as to better give play to the great role of putting politics in command, using the virtual to lead the real, and combining the virtual and the real. Use the victory on the ideological front to guarantee the victory on the economic front, and consolidate and develop the victory on the ideological front in the victory on the economic front, so that they promote each other, influence each other, push the waves, and achieve common victory.

In the in-depth publicity and implementation of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution and the launching of a large-scale socialist and communist education movement, we must be good at using the masses' self-education methods and combine the publicity of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution with the publicity of the achievements of the ten years since the founding of the country. Experience has proven that mobilizing cadres and the masses to recall and compare, trace the roots, look forward to the future, compare with real objects, speak freely and debate, compare examples, and tell personal experiences are all effective methods. Because the broad cadres and the people are direct participants and creators of the ten years of achievement and the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, their feelings are the deepest and most intimate. After people look, think, compare, and debate, their eyes are bright, right and wrong are distinguished, their consciousness is raised, and their enthusiasm arises spontaneously, and the labor attendance rate and work efficiency can be greatly improved, and production and other work can be quickly changed and improved. Through carrying out recollection and comparison, cadres and the masses of Licheng County analyzed the huge changes brought to the people by the great changes in the past ten years, especially since the communization, with their own personal experiences and feelings. At this level, we further traced the roots, summarized experience, rose to a higher level, and combined it with speaking freely and debating. In this way, vivid facts powerfully refuted the various fallacies of right-leaning opportunists; examined and criticized some people's right-leaning thoughts, right-leaning emotions, and capitalist, departmentalist, and individualist thoughts; clarified the confused views on some issues, and further drew a clear line between the two roads and the two lines. From this, it can be seen that this is a vivid, lively, profound, and concrete socialist and communist education, and also a profound and practical class education. On this basis, we established lofty ambitions, looked forward to the future, clarified the future direction, discussed and formulated long-term plans, and put forward the slogan of "ten years to see three years, three years to see one year, and one year to see the present," and organized the high enthusiasm and revolutionary drive of the masses into the current production and the completion of other tasks. Therefore, it has powerfully promoted the current production and procurement of agricultural products and other tasks, and set off a new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement with greater scale and greater drive. Tancheng County held material exhibitions in every village and combined them with recollection and comparison, which also achieved good results. Someone said well: "If you don't think and don't look, you're confused, but if you think and look, you're clear." As long as all regions make good use of these experiences, they will push the socialist and communist education movement centered on publicizing and implementing the Eighth Plenary Session resolution to a broader and deeper stage, so that the increase production and practice economy movement will develop forward wave after wave and successfully complete various tasks.

　　更广泛更深入地开展社会主义、共产主义教育运动
    山东大众日报十月十一日社论
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议，是向新的胜利大进军的伟大号角，是鼓舞人民群众实现今年继续跃进，并在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标的动力。自公报和决议公布以来，全省各级党委以最快的速度，采取各种形式，进行了广泛深入的宣传，开展了一个全民性的声势浩大的学习讨论八中全会公报、决议的热潮，使全省广大党员、干部和群众受到了一次深刻的社会主义、共产主义教育。
    在八中全会公报、决议的鼓舞下，在全省范围内，从城市到农村，从工矿企业到人民公社，出现了群情振奋、喜气洋洋的热烈气氛，并以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势，掀起了规模巨大的增产节约运动的新高潮；在今年1至8月份继续跃进的基础上，各个战线在9月份都取得了前所未有的辉煌成就。工业生产扶摇直上，进展迅速。钢产量达到两万七千多吨，平均日产量和8月份相比，增长了62.4％；生铁产量达到十六万九千多吨，平均日产量比8月份增长51％；原煤产量达到二百零六万多吨，平均日产量比8月份增长25％。此外，像机床、电机生产等，也都有很大增长。今年1至9月份，我省共生产钢十二万五千多吨，比去年同期增长三点四二倍；生产生铁九十八万吨，比去年同期增长十一倍多；生产原煤一千五百九十六万多吨，比去年同期增长一点零九倍。日用品生产不仅基本上恢复了去年同期的品种，而且又增加了一千六百九十八种新品种，从而更好地满足了人民生活的需要。广大农村也发生了新的变化，到处都是干劲冲天，红旗招展。在取得早秋作物丰收以后，晚秋作物丰收捷报相继传来，而且收得又快又好；小麦播种不仅进度快，而且质量高，截至目前已播种近五千万亩，比去年同期快四倍，深耕、施肥、密植都大大超过去秋，许多地区还实现了畦田化。人民公社正沿着巩固和健全的道路继续向前发展，并越来越大地显示了它的优越性和强大生命力。在商业战线上，也取得重大的胜利，全省已超额完成早秋作物粮食征购任务，市场情况大大好转。文教、卫生、科学、体育等项工作，在服务政治、结合生产的前提下，也在阔步前进。总之，当前形势好得很，群众的热情空前高涨。正像有些地区所形容的：“群众闻风而起，积极分子扬眉吐气，生产面貌焕然一新”。这就充分地证明了最坚决最迅速地宣传和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，是促使各项工作继续跃进，掀起新的增产节约运动高潮，并提前超额完成今年国民经济计划的根本保证和强大动力，是搞好一切工作的总纲和灵魂。
    目前，各个地区在胜利结束三级干部会议之后，采取党内党外、支部教育和群众宣传相结合的方法，正在广大基层干部和党员、群众中展开八中全会决议的宣传和贯彻，以便将增产节约运动推向更大的高潮，取得更大的成绩。在广大干部、党员、群众中更广泛更深入地宣传和贯彻八中全会决议，必将成为一次大规模的社会主义、共产主义教育运动和整风运动。通过这个运动，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利旗帜，把右倾反透、把干劲鼓足，乘胜前进，勇往直前；彻底划清社会主义和资本主义道路的界限，进一步克服少数富裕农民的资本主义自发倾向，坚定走公社化道路的信念；摆正国家、集体和个人的关系，加强工农联盟、城乡互助和积极支援国家建设的教育，克服某些干部和群众的只顾集体不顾国家，或只顾个人不顾集体和国家的本位主义、个人主义思想；牢固地树立相信集体、依靠集体和大搞群众运动的正确态度。如此，不仅能够更好地肃清右倾机会主义分子的思想影响，使之无立足之地，而且可以大大提高广大干部、党员、群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，鼓足更大的干劲，以更高的革命热情，完成省委提出的各项战斗任务：在工业战线上，保证提前半个月完成全年的工业生产计划；在农业战线上，种足种好七千万亩小麦，收好晚秋作物，并适时地掀起以水、肥、土为中心的冬季生产高潮；在财贸战线上，完成七十亿斤的粮食征购任务和其他农副产品采购计划。因此，在深入宣传和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议中，不能有任何自满情绪或和当前工作对立起来的观点，而要在已有的基础上，展开更广泛更深入地以宣传八中全会决议为中心的社会主义、共产主义教育运动，并和进一步发动和组织增产节约运动高潮，开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的劳动竞赛，完成工农业生产跃进计划以及副产品采购计划紧密结合起来，更好地发挥政治挂帅、以虚带实和虚实并举的伟大作用。以思想战线的胜利保证经济战线的胜利，在经济战线的胜利中巩固和发展思想战线的胜利，使之互相推动，互相影响，推波助浪，共同胜利。
    在深入宣传和贯彻八中全会决议，开展大规模地社会主义、共产主义教育运动中，必须善于运用群众自我教育的方法，并把宣传八中全会决议同宣传建国十年成就结合在一起。经验证明，发动干部和群众回忆对比，追根求源，展望将来和实物对比，鸣放争辩，实例对比，现身说法等，都是行之有效的方法。因为广大干部和人民群众是十年成就和大跃进、人民公社的直接参加者和创造者，他们的感受最深刻最亲切。人们经过看一看、想一想、比一比、辩一辩，眼睛明亮了，是非分清了，觉悟提高了，干劲便油然而生，劳动出勤率和工作效率就可以大大提高，生产和其他工作就可以很快变样，大有起色。历城县通过开展回忆对比，干部和群众以自己的亲身经历和亲身体会，分析十年来特别是公社化以来的巨大变化给人民群众带来的好处。在这个水平上，进而追根求源，总结经验，上升提高，并结合鸣放争辩。这样就以生动的事实，有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义分子种种谬论；检查和批判了某些人的右倾思想、右倾情绪和资本主义、本位主义和个人主义思想；澄清了在某些问题上的糊涂看法，进一步划清了两条道路和两条路线的界限。由此可见，这是一次生动、活泼、深刻、具体的社会主义和共产主义教育，也是深刻实际的阶级教育。在这个基础上，立雄心大志，展望将来，明确前途方向，讨论和制订远景规划，提出“十年看三年，三年看一年，一年看眼前”的口号，把群众高涨的热情和革命干劲组织到当前的生产和完成其他任务上来。因而有力地推动了当前生产和农产品采购等项工作，掀起了规模更大、干劲更足的增产节约运动新高潮。郯城县村村举办实物展览，并和回忆对比结合起来，也收到了很好的效果，有人说得好：“不想不看糊里糊涂，一想一看清清楚楚。”各地只要很好地运用这些经验，就会将以宣传贯彻八中全会决议为中心内容的社会主义、共产主义教育运动推向更广泛更深入的阶段，使增产节约运动一浪高过一浪的向前发展，胜利地完成各项任务。
