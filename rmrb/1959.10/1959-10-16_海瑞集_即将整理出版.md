“The Collected Works of Hai Rui” to be Published Soon

Hai Rui was a famous upright official of the Ming Dynasty who did many good things for the people. He represented the progressive forces in feudal society and fought stubbornly against the corrupt and greedy rulers throughout his life. Hai Rui's collection of writings, whether memorials and official documents, private letters, or some administrative regulations, closely reflects the political and economic situation at the time, and is therefore a good source of historical information. His "Chun'an County Governance" and the regulations he established during his tenure as governor of Jiangnan specifically record all the rules and regulations of the local government of the Ming Dynasty. From his clear stipulations on taxation, corvée labor, and administrative expenses, it can be seen that he paid so much attention to promoting benefits and eliminating malpractices, reducing the burden on the people, and preventing corruption among officials.

The "Collected Works of Hai Rui," newly re-edited by Zhonghua Book Company and soon to be published, has the following characteristics: it references several Ming and Qing versions and brings together all the articles from each version; it has collected some lost articles from local chronicles, made necessary corrections, added modern punctuation; in addition to the original attached biographies and elegies, it has also collected some relevant materials from Ming Dynasty historical books and notes for reference when reading. Therefore, this is a relatively complete edition.

　　“海瑞集”即将整理出版
    海瑞是明代著名的清官，为人民做过不少好事。他代表封建社会中的进步力量，顽强地同腐朽贪婪的统治者战斗了一生。海瑞文集中，无论是奏议公文、私人信札和一部分施政条例，都密切反映了当时的政治经济情况，因此是很好的历史资料。他的“淳安县政事”和他在江南巡抚任上所订立的条约，都具体地记载了明代地方政府的一切规章制度。从他对于税收、差役和行政开支都有明确的规定，可以看出他是那么注意兴利革弊，减轻人民负担和杜绝官吏贪污。
    现在经中华书局重编不久即将出版的“海瑞集”，有如下的特点：参考了好几种明、清的版本，集合了各本所有的文章；从县志里辑出了一些佚文，作了必要的校勘，加了新式标点；除了原来附录的传记和荣哀录以外，又从明代的史籍、笔记中辑录了一些有关资料，以供阅读时参考。因此，这是一个比较完备的本子。
