Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th: The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concluded this morning its discussion on the first item on the agenda – the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. All deputies unanimously adopted, in the name of the Supreme People's Assembly, a letter to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the people of South Korea, and a letter to the parliaments of all countries of the world, regarding the issue of peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The letters put forward suggestions for the peaceful reunification of Korea and called on South Korean parliamentarians and people from all walks of life to unite and form an anti-American national salvation united front to force the withdrawal of US troops and achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The letters call on the parliaments of all countries and peace-loving people to support the just struggle of the Korean people.

The letters state: Our nation has been divided into North and South for more than fourteen years, and the misfortunes caused by the division of the country and the nation have reached their peak today. It is now urgently required that we take national salvation measures. The time has indeed come for the entire nation to unite, launch a national salvation struggle, and dedicate all its strength, enthusiasm, and wisdom to the destiny of the country and the future of the nation.

The letters state: The critical situation in which South Korea finds itself today does not allow all Korean people who care about the future of the fatherland and the destiny of the nation to remain silent. Today, the number of factories in South Korea with smokestacks not emitting smoke is increasing. There is no independence of the national economy to be seen there, only foreign goods flooding the market; millions of able-bodied and talented young people are unemployed, and in South Korea, once known as a granary, countless farmers are groaning on the starvation line, unable to find a livelihood. National culture and art are withering day by day, and civil rights are being trampled upon. The Korean people are subjected to indescribable insults and abuses by the US invading army.

The letters point out that these are the evil consequences of US imperialism's occupation of South Korea and the implementation of colonial rule. "US imperialists, disregarding the sincere wishes of all Korean people, artificially divide our fatherland, continue to occupy South Korea, and turn South Korea into its colony, military base, and market for surplus goods."

The letters state: However, in the situation where the country is divided, we have transformed northern Korea into an industrial-agricultural country with an independent national economic foundation, laying a solid foundation for the establishment of a unified and independent country. If the people of North and South Korea can build the national economy side by side in a unified fatherland and develop national culture together, then we will surely create a happy life more quickly, more smoothly, and more satisfactorily.

The letters state: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made consistent and sincere efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. However, US imperialism and Syngman Rhee have desperately obstructed it, shipping large quantities of destructive weapons, atomic weapons and missiles into Korea, and continuing to prepare for war frantically. Syngman Rhee is madly clamoring for so-called "northward advance."

The letters say that the history of fourteen years eloquently proves that the policy consistently adhered to by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and that the Korean people should unify the fatherland themselves on a democratic basis – is correct. "Persisting in the idea of solving the problem by war is wishful thinking." "For us, there is no other way out except to immediately withdraw US troops and unify the fatherland by the Korean people themselves through peaceful consultation."

The letters emphasize: We are all a single nation that has lived on this land since ancient times. As long as it is for the struggle for the withdrawal of US troops and for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, we welcome all, regardless of their political views, party affiliation, or past, and we must move forward hand in hand with them. "Let all patriotic political parties and social organizations unite all their strength to withdraw US troops and, without any foreign interference, carry out free general elections in North and South Korea according to the will of the Korean people themselves, to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. In order to promote this great cause, a standing committee should first be formed by representatives of the North and South Korean parliaments, governments, or political parties and social organizations to discuss the issue of unifying the fatherland and practical issues such as elections. In order to effectively guarantee the elections, full freedom of political activity must be guaranteed to the various political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life in North and South Korea throughout the country."

The letters say, fight to realize the exchange of letters, mutual tourism, and free movement between North and South Korea. "Whether it is between political parties, social organizations, or individuals in North and South Korea, or between the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, regardless of the form, we must gather together, frankly and freely talk about each other's feelings. In order to realize the great cause of peaceful reunification, we must eliminate misunderstandings, distrust, stop fighting each other, and achieve consensus on different opinions."

The letters say: "In order to ease tensions and reduce the heavy burden of military expenditure on the people, the armies of North and South Korea must first be reduced to below 100,000 each."

The letters say that the mutual exchange of economy, culture, science, art, sports and other sectors in North and South Korea should be realized as soon as possible. First of all, a standing committee for North-South economic development and exchanges should be formed by economic representatives from North and South Korea in order to link and coordinate the economic development of North and South Korea, and to discuss specific issues for realizing economic exchanges.

The letters say: We are willing to share all the achievements we have made in the economic and cultural sectors with the people of South Korea. In order to restore the national economy of South Korea, we can supply electricity, coal, iron, cement, modern machinery, equipment and materials, and also supply chemical fertilizers and equipment needed for irrigation projects to the declining South Korean countryside.

The letters call: "People from all walks of life in South Korea must unite strongly and form a broad anti-American national salvation united front! Only the withdrawal of US troops and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland can free the people of South Korea from the dangerous situation they are in today."

The letters say: "The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea writes this letter to you, sincerely hoping that the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and people from all walks of life in South Korea will unanimously support our proposal. We are convinced that all patriotic people from all walks of life in South Korea, such as workers, farmers, intellectuals, youths, students, merchants, entrepreneurs, and religious figures, who cherish the future of the fatherland and the destiny of the nation, will rise up like a giant and fight to realize this lofty proposal."

    朝鲜最高人民会议向南朝鲜国会和人民发出号召
    迫使美军撤走　实现祖国统一
    呼吁各国国会和人民支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    据新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天上午结束了对会议第一项议程——关于祖国的和平统一的讨论。全体议员一致通过了就祖国的和平统一问题，以最高人民会议的名义给大韩民国国会和南朝鲜人民的信和给世界各国国会的信，信中提出了和平统一朝鲜的建议，并号召南朝鲜国会议员和各界人民团结起来，组成反美救国统一战线，迫使美军撤走，实现祖国的和平统一。信中呼吁世界各国国会和爱好和平的人民支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    信中说：我们民族被分割于南北两部分已经过了十四年多，由于国土和民族的分裂所造成的不幸，今天已经达到顶点。现在正刻不容缓地要求我们采取救国措施。全民族团结一致、展开救国斗争，为国家的命运、民族的前途而献出一切力量、热情和智慧的时机确实已经到来了。
    信中说：今天南朝鲜所处的危急情况，不容许一切关心祖国的将来和民族命运的朝鲜人民保持沉默。今天，南朝鲜烟囱不冒烟的工厂正与日俱增。在那里看不到民族经济的独立性，所能见到的只是外国商品充斥市场；几百万有能力和才智的青壮年失了业，在曾以谷仓闻名的南朝鲜，到处有找不到生计的无数农民呻吟在饥饿线上。民族文化和艺术日见萎缩，民权遭到摧残。朝鲜人民受着美国侵略军的难以形容的侮辱和虐待。
    这封信指出，这就是美帝国主义强占南朝鲜和实行殖民统治的罪恶后果。“美帝国主义者不顾全体朝鲜人民的切实愿望，人为地分裂我们的祖国，继续强占南朝鲜，并把南朝鲜变为它的殖民地、军事基地和剩余商品的市场。”
    信中说：但是，在国家被分裂的情况下，我们却把朝鲜北部转变成为有独立的民族经济基础的工业—农业国家，打下了建立统一独立国家的巩固基础。如果南北朝鲜人民能在统一的祖国内并肩建设民族经济，一起发展民族文化的话，那么我们就一定会更加迅速、更加顺利、更加圆满地创造幸福的生活。
    信中说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了实现祖国的和平统一进行了一贯的有诚意的努力。但是，美帝国主义和李承晚却拼命加以阻挠，它们把大批毁灭性的武器原子武器和导弹运入朝鲜，继续疯狂地准备战争。李承晚正在疯狂地叫嚣所谓“北进”。
    信中说，十四年来的历史雄辩地证明，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一贯坚持的方针——一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上统一祖国是正确的。“坚持想以战争方法来解决问题，这是妄想。”“对于我们来说，除了使美军立即撤走，用和平协商的方法，由朝鲜人民自己统一祖国这一条途径外，再没有其他第二条出路了。”
    这封信强调说：我们都是自古以来一直生活在这块国土上的单一民族。只要是为了美军撤走、为了祖国的和平统一而斗争，我们就不问其政治见解、政党派别及其过去如何，一律表示欢迎，并要同他们携手前进。“让我们所有爱国的政党和社会团体把一切力量都联合起来，使美军撤走，在没有任何外力干涉的情况下，根据朝鲜人民自己的意志，进行南北朝鲜的自由普选，来实现祖国的和平统一。为了促进这项伟大事业，首先要由南北朝鲜国会、政府或政党、社会团体的代表组成常设委员会，讨论统一祖国的问题和选举等实际问题。为了有效地保证选举，对南北朝鲜的各政党、社会团体和各界人士，必须保证他们在全国范围内进行政治活动的完全的自由。”
    信中说，要为实现南北朝鲜的书信来往、相互观光和自由来往而斗争。“不论在南北朝鲜的政党、社会团体或个别人士之间，或在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和大韩民国国会之间，不问其形式如何，要聚集一堂，坦率地互相畅谈各自的感情。为了实现和平统一的伟大事业，要消除误会、不信任，停止互相反目，还要使不同的意见取得一致。”
    信中说：“为了缓和紧张局势、减轻人民过重的军费负担，首先要把南北朝鲜的军队分别裁减到十万名以下。”
    信中说，南北朝鲜的经济、文化、科学、艺术、体育以及其他部门的相互交流，应当早日实现。首先要由南北朝鲜的经济代表组成南北经济发展和交流常设委员会，以便联络和调节南北朝鲜的经济发展，互相讨论实现经济交流的具体问题。
    信中说：我们愿意同南朝鲜人民一起分享我们在经济文化部门所取得的一切成就。为了恢复南朝鲜的民族经济，我们可以供应电力、煤炭、铁、水泥、现代化机械设备和器材，还可以向衰落不堪的南朝鲜农村供应化学肥料和灌溉工程所需要的器材设备。
    信中号召：“南朝鲜各界人民要坚强地团结起来，组成广大的反美救国统一战线！只有美军撤走和和平统一祖国，才能使南朝鲜人民摆脱今天这样危险的处境。”
    信中说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议给你们写这封信，衷心希望大韩民国国会和南朝鲜各界人士一致拥护我们的这项建议。我们确信：珍视祖国的将来和民族命运的南朝鲜工人、农民、知识分子、青年、学生、商人、企业家和宗教界人士等各界全体爱国人民，一定会像一个巨人似地奋起，为实现这项崇高的建议而斗争。”
