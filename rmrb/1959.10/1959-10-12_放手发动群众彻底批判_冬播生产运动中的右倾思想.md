Fully Mobilize the Masses to Thoroughly Criticize Right-leaning Thought in the Winter Planting Production Campaign

A mass-based, vigorous upsurge in the winter planting production campaign has emerged throughout the province. This upsurge is characterized by: early arrival, rapid pace, fierce momentum, large scale, and deep-rooted solidity. Among them, the Xiangyang Special District has done particularly well. Winter planting in the earlier-season mountainous areas has largely concluded; in the plains and hilly areas, the summer coarse grains have also been basically sown, and wheat is about to enter a stage of large-scale planting. Other special districts, due to the later season, although the scale of the winter planting production campaign is not as large as that of Xiangyang, they are also doing very well. All of this proves that a production upsurge centered on winter planting has formed throughout the province and is developing vigorously with overwhelming force. This creates a good start for realizing a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

The reason why this year's winter planting production upsurge has come early, quickly, and fiercely is by no means accidental. It is the result of resolutely implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, opposing right-leaning tendencies, and boosting morale to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. It is the result of conducting socialist and general line education among the broad masses of peasants, and it is the result of the increasingly full realization of the superiority of the people's communes. It is a continuation of the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, and an inevitable trend of agricultural production continuously developing at high speed in the great socialist construction cause.

However, we should also see another aspect, that is, in the current winter planting production campaign, there is still a right-leaning conservative countercurrent. This countercurrent is mainly manifested in two aspects: formulating winter planting production plans and carrying out technological reforms. What attitude should we take towards formulating this year's winter planting production plan? Should it be a positive attitude or a negative attitude? Should we formulate a leap-forward plan or a conservative plan? Obviously, it should be the former, not the latter. However, some regions, under the control of right-leaning conservative thought, have adopted a negative attitude and formulated a backward conservative, or similar backward conservative plan. It is said that the plans of several counties only intend to achieve an average wheat yield of 150 jin per mu next year, which is not even as high as the average wheat yield of the province last year. It is said that some communes and production teams have already achieved an average wheat yield of more than 300 jin or 400 jin per mu last year, but this year's plan is still 300 jin or 400 jin per mu, and even if there is some improvement, the proportion of the increase is pitifully small. How can this achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1960? Obviously, right-leaning conservative thought has gained the upper hand in their minds. They are afraid of difficulties and dare not stride forward with their heads held high, holding high the red flag of the general line. Years of experience have proved that without an advanced and reliable plan and struggle goal, it is impossible to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to a greater extent, and as a result, it is impossible to achieve greater achievements in agricultural production.

More seriously, in the current winter planting production campaign, some people in some areas oppose technological reforms. There is a small team in Dangyang County where the masses are willing to deep plow, but the team leader opposes deep plowing, ordering the masses not to exceed three inches, and saying, "I am fully responsible, you don't need to worry about it." Although this serious situation is not very common, if it is allowed to develop, the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture will not be fully implemented, technological reforms will be interrupted, and it will bring significant losses to agricultural production.

We must have sufficient estimation of this situation and should see that right-leaning conservative thought is the main obstacle in the current winter planting production, and the main obstacle to realizing a greater leap forward in 1960. Without thoroughly overcoming this right-leaning conservative thought, a vigorous production upsurge is impossible to appear in some areas. Therefore, at present, we should fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative thought, resolutely implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and carry out the technological revolution to the end. The socialist and general line education is currently being carried out in the countryside, and criticizing right-leaning conservative thought in winter planting production is an important content of socialist education. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to first launch a struggle against right-leaning conservative thought in winter planting production, and it is necessary to achieve victory in this struggle. Facts have proved that without ideological victory, there can be no production victory. If we want to launch a vigorous mass-based winter planting production campaign, we must first launch a vigorous mass-based movement to criticize right-leaning conservative thought.

In the method of criticizing right-leaning conservative thought, the most important thing is to fully mobilize the masses and carry out large-scale debates. We must criticize while acting, do not just sit in the house to criticize, but go to the fields to criticize, do not make empty criticisms, but criticize through concrete facts, use the method of contrasting good and bad typical examples to criticize, and criticize by summarizing the winter planting experience of last year. We must bring out vivid facts and persuade people with reason, and not just attach big labels. These methods are already well known to everyone and should now be put to good use.

In the countryside, two movements are currently underway, one is the ideological movement of socialist and general line education, and the other is the production movement centered on winter planting. We must link these two movements together to promote each other and cause each other. Use socialist and general line education as a driving force to promote the current winter planting production, so that winter planting production is more colorful and develops more steadily. Achieve a double harvest of ideology and production, and achieve complete victory.

### 放手发动群众彻底批判  冬播生产运动中的右倾思想

　　放手发动群众彻底批判  冬播生产运动中的右倾思想
    一个群众性的轰轰烈烈的冬播生产运动高潮，已经在全省范围内出现了。这个高潮的特点是：来的早，来的快，来的猛，规模宏大而且又深入扎实。其中特别是以襄阳专区搞得最出色。季节较早的山区的冬播工作已大部结束；平原丘陵地区的夏杂粮，也已经基本播种完毕，小麦即将进入大规模的播种阶段。其他专区，因为季节较迟，冬播生产运动的规模虽然还没有像襄阳地区那样大，但做的也很好。这一切都证明，一个以冬播为中心的生产高潮，在全省范围内已经形成，并且正以雷霆万钧之势蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。这就为实现1960年农业生产的更大跃进，创造一个良好的开端。
    今年的冬播生产运动高潮之所以来的早，来的快，来的猛，绝不是偶然的。而是坚决贯彻八届八中全会精神、反右倾鼓干劲开展增产节约运动的结果，是向广大农民群众进行社会主义和总路线教育的结果，是人民公社的优越性愈来愈发挥得更充分的结果。是1959年农业生产大跃进的继续，是农业生产在伟大的社会主义建设事业中不断以高速度向前发展的必然趋势。
    但是，我们还应当看到另一个方面，那就是在目前的冬播生产运动中，还存在着一股右倾保守的逆流。这股逆流，主要表现在制订冬播生产规划和进行技术改革两个方面。我们对制订今年的冬播生产规划，究竟应当抱什么样的态度呢？是积极的态度，还是消极的态度呢？是制订一个跃进的规划，还是制订一个保守的规划呢？显然，应当是前者而不应当是后者。但是有些地区，在右倾保守思想的支配下，竟采取了消极的态度，制订出一个落后保守的，或者是类似落后保守的规划。据说有几个县的规划，明年小麦只打算平均亩产一百五十斤，还不及去年全省小麦的平均产量高。据说有些公社和生产队，去年小麦已经达到平均亩产三百多斤或四百多斤，而今年的规划，仍是三百多斤或四百多斤，即便有些提高，而提高的比例也是小得可怜。这样怎么能实现1960年农业生产的更大跃进呢？显而易见，右倾保守思想，在他们的脑海中占了上风。他们惧怕困难，不敢昂首阔步高举总路线的红旗前进。几年来的经验证明，没有一个既先进又可靠的规划和奋斗目标，就不可能在更大的限度内调动群众的积极性，其结果也就不可能使农业生产取得更大的成绩。
    更严重的是，在当前冬播生产运动中，局部地区出现有些人反对技术改革。当阳县有一个小队，群众愿意深耕，而小队长反对深耕，命令群众不准超过三寸，并说，我完全负责，你们不要管。这种严重情况，虽然不太多，但假如任其发展下去，八字宪法将不能得到全面的贯彻，技术改革将会中断，对农业生产将会带来重大的损失。
    我们对这种情况要有足够的估计，应当看到右倾保守思想是当前冬播生产中的主要障碍，是实现1960年更大跃进的主要障碍。不把这种右倾保守思想彻底克服，在局部地区，就不可能出现轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。因此目前我们就应当放手发动群众，彻底批判与克服右倾保守思想，坚决贯彻执行八字宪法，把技术革命进行到底。目前在农村中正在进行社会主义和总路线的教育，而批判冬播生产中的右倾保守思想，正是社会主义教育的重要内容。要发动群众首先针对着冬播生产中的右倾保守思想开展斗争，而且要一定取得这一斗争的胜利。事实证明，没有思想上的胜利，就不可能有生产上的胜利。要想开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的冬播生产运动，就必须首先开展一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的批判右倾保守思想的运动。
    在批判右倾保守思想的方法上，最主要的是放手发动群众，开展大辩论。要边行动，边批判，不要光坐在房子里批判，要到田里去批判，不要空动的批判，要通过具体事实去批判，要运用好坏典型对比的方法去批判，要通过总结去年的冬播经验去批判，要拿出活生生的事实，以理服人，不要光扣大帽子。这些方法，都是大家早已熟知的，现在要很好地把它都运用起来。
    在农村中，现在正在开展两个运动，一个是社会主义和总路线教育的思想运动，一个是以冬播为中心的生产运动。我们要把这两个运动扭在一起，使其互相促进，互为因果。把社会主义和总路线的教育作为动力，来推动当前的冬播生产，使冬播生产更加有声有色，更加踏踏实实地向前发展。达到思想、生产双丰收齐胜利。
