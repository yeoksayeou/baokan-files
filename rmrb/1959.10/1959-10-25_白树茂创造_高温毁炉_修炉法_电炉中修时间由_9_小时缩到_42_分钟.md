Xinhua News Agency, 24th - Bai Shumao, a steelmaking worker at the Beijing Steel Plant, has created the "high-temperature furnace destruction" repair method, recently reducing the medium repair time for a 1.5-ton electric furnace from nine hours to forty-two minutes. Under his influence, a competition to "learn from Shumao, catch up with Shumao" has been launched throughout the plant. On October 8th and 10th, the Sun Yuzhen group and the Zhang Wenkui group shortened the electric furnace medium repair time to forty-one minutes and thirty-nine minutes, respectively. On the 16th, the Zhou Changbao group further shortened the medium repair time to twenty-nine minutes, reaching the most advanced level in the country. Bai Shumao has been selected as a representative to attend the National "Congress of Heroes."

"Only by daring to think can one figure things out, and only by daring to act can one achieve results!" This is Bai Shumao's main experience. This year, the Beijing Steel Plant has taken various measures to reduce the electric furnace medium repair time from twelve hours to nine hours. Bai Shumao, a twenty-four-year-old Communist Party member, thought to himself every time he received a furnace repair task: "Time is steel, and shortening the furnace repair time by one hour can produce more than half a furnace of steel! Since the medium repair time can be shortened from twelve hours to nine hours, why can't it be shortened even further?" Under this guiding thought, he tried every means to study techniques to further shorten the furnace repair time. After hearing that the furnace repair time at the Benxi Steel Plant was only four hours, he felt that he could no longer be satisfied with the status quo. He immediately ran to the leaders of the workshop party organization to put forward his ideas. The leadership supported his opinion and mobilized workers of all trades in the entire workshop to jointly study this issue. In the past, when repairing furnaces, workers had to wait for the temperature inside the furnace to cool down before dismantling the furnace wall for repair; however, after the furnace wall cooled down, it became very hard, which wasted a lot of time for dismantling and repairing. In order to gain speed, one day in late April, Bai Shumao operated in high temperature as soon as the molten steel was poured out, resulting in a four- to five-fold increase in the speed of destroying the furnace wall compared to after the furnace had cooled, and thus created the "high-temperature furnace destruction" repair method. Later, the Bai Shumao group also improved many tools and accelerated the hoisting work during the furnace dismantling and bricklaying process.

Since adopting the "high-temperature furnace destruction" repair method, the Bai Shumao group has saved the state 272 hours of work repair time, which can produce 105 more furnaces of steel.

### 白树茂创造“高温毁炉”修炉法  电炉中修时间由9小时缩到42分钟

    白树茂创造“高温毁炉”修炉法
    电炉中修时间由9小时缩到42分钟
    新华社24日讯　北京钢厂炼钢工人白树茂创造了“高温毁炉”修炉法，最近把一吨半的电炉中修时间由九小时缩短到四十二分钟。在他的影响下，全厂掀起了“学树茂、赶树茂”的竞赛。10月8日、10日，孙玉振小组和张文奎小组分别把电炉中修时间缩短到四十一分和三十九分钟。16日，周长保小组更把中修时间缩短到二十九分钟，达到全国最先进水平。白树茂已被选为出席全国“群英会”的代表。
    “敢想才能想得出，敢作才能作得到！”这是白树茂的主要经验。今年北京钢厂采取各项措施，把电炉中修时间由十二小时缩短到九小时。二十四岁的共产党员白树茂每次接到修炉任务时心里就想：“时间就是钢，修炉的时间每缩短一小时就能多大半炉钢！既然能把中修时间由十二小时缩短到九小时，为什么不能缩得更短一些呢？”就在这个思想指导下，他千方百计地钻研技术继续缩短修炉时间的办法。当他听到本溪钢厂修炉时间只四小时的消息以后，感到更不能安于现状了。他马上跑去找车间党组织领导人把自己的想法提出。领导上支持他的意见，发动了全车间各工种的工人共同钻研这个问题。过去修炉的时候，工人要等炉内温度冷却下来再拆炉墙修理；但是炉墙冷却之后非常坚硬，拆修起来很耽误时间。为了争取速度，4月底的一天，白树茂在钢水一倾出炉，就冒着高温操作，结果使毁炉墙速度比炉冷后提高了四、五倍，从此创造了“高温毁炉”修炉法。后来白树茂小组又改进了许多工具，加快了拆炉、砌炉过程中的吊装工作。
    采用“高温毁炉”修炉法以来，白树茂小组已经为国家节约了二百七十二小时的工修时间，可以多炼一百零五炉钢。
