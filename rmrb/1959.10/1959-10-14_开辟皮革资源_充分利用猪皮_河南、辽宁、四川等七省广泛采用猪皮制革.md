Opening up Leather Resources and Fully Utilizing Pigskin
Henan, Liaoning, Sichuan and other seven provinces widely use pigskin tanning

(Our report) There is great potential for the development of pigskin tanning. From January to September this year, the number of pigskins peeled in Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Yunnan, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan provinces alone reached 2.06 million, equivalent to 1.02 million cow hides.

In Shandong and other places in China, pigskin has long been an important leather raw material and has been fully utilized. However, due to the use of the ancient saltpeter tanning method, it is prone to water penetration, and the coarse pores of pigskin make the quality unsatisfactory. In recent years, the vast number of leather workers have rapidly mastered the properties of pigskin through vigorous technological innovation and the beautification of pig leather, so that the quality of pig leather has been significantly improved. Whether it is the abrasion resistance, aesthetics, or water resistance of the leather, it has been greatly improved compared to the past. Now, leather products made of various beautified pig leathers are not only more beautiful than cowhide but also have some varieties that cowhide products do not have. A type of pig leather called electrostatic flocking uses high-voltage direct current to implant various fibers onto the pig suede leather, and different landscapes, figures, and other patterns are implanted according to different uses. This kind of product has bright colors, flexible patterns, and is beautiful and generous. Another type of processed corrected grain leather has a surface pattern of pigskin that is as delicate and smooth as cowhide. There is also a type of embossed and color-matched leather, which first embosses the pigskin surface and then sprays different colors to make women's handbags, with coordinated and elegant colors and a three-dimensional effect. In order to solve the problem of water seepage in pigskin, a waterproof suede leather has now been developed. This type of leather is treated with a waterproofing agent and is not easily penetrated by water, improving its water resistance. With the continuous improvement of pig leather quality, the uses of pig leather are becoming more and more extensive. At present, there are 33 varieties in mass production, which are widely used in industry, agriculture, and people's daily life. Such as leather knots, leather rings, leather rollers, and shuttle belts for the textile industry, transmission belts for the mechanical industry, oil seals for automobiles, saddles for bicycles, harnesses for carts, leather shoes, leather boots, leather cases, leather bags, gloves, and various sports equipment.

The use of pigskin for tanning not only opens up new leather resources for the country and solves the raw materials for the leather industry but also saves a large amount of cowhide and rubber, so that these cowhide and rubber can be used for more needed national defense construction and industrial construction.

China is a country with extremely rich pigskin resources. If we calculate based on the number of 160 million pigs in 1958, and a slaughter rate of 60%, we can get 96 million heads. If 20% of them are peeled, 19.2 million pigskins can be obtained. (Attached picture)

### 开辟皮革资源　充分利用猪皮  河南、辽宁、四川等七省广泛采用猪皮制革

　　开辟皮革资源　充分利用猪皮
    河南、辽宁、四川等七省广泛采用猪皮制革
    本报讯　猪皮制革工作大有发展前途。今年1至9月份，仅河南、陕西、辽宁、云南、贵州、黑龙江、四川等省开剥的猪皮达二百零六万张，相当于一百零二万张牛皮。
    我国山东等地在很早以前，猪皮就成为一项重要的皮革原料充分得到利用，由于采用了古老的硝鞣法，容易透水，加以猪皮毛孔粗，在质量上不能令人满意。近几年来广大皮革职工通过大搞技术革新与美化猪革，迅速掌握了猪皮的性能，使得猪革质量有了显著的提高，不论皮革的耐磨性、皮革的美观与防水性等都比过去有了很大改进。现在用各种美化猪革制成的革制品，不仅比牛皮美观，而且有些品种是牛皮制品所没有的。一种叫静电植绒的猪皮革，利用高压直流电将各种纤维植于猪绒面革上，根据不同用途植成各种山水、人物等图案花纹，这种制品颜色鲜艳，图样灵活，美观大方。另一种经过加工的修正粒面革，猪皮的表面花纹与牛皮一样细致、平整，还有一种压花套色革，是先把猪皮面压成花纹，然后喷涂各种不同的颜色，制成的女式提包，颜色协调雅致，富有立体感。为了解决猪皮渗水问题，现在制成一种防水绒面革，这种革是经过防水剂处理后，遇水不容易渗透，提高了抗水性。随着猪革质量的不断提高，猪革的用途也越来越广阔。目前大量生产的品种已有三十三种，广泛地应用于工业、农业和人民日常生活。如纺织工业用的皮结、皮圈、皮辊、打梭皮带，机械工业用的传动用轮带，汽车上的护油圈，自行车的坐鞍，大车挽具，皮鞋、皮靴、皮箱、皮包、手套以及各种体育用具等。
    利用猪皮制革，不仅为国家开辟了新的皮革资源，解决了制革工业的原料，而且大量节约了牛皮与橡胶，使这些牛皮与橡胶用到更为需要的国防建设与工业建设上去。
    我国是个猪皮资源极为丰富的国家，如果以1958年生猪头数一亿六，按屠宰率60％计算，即可得九千六百万头，利用20％剥皮的话，可剥取猪皮一千九百二十万张。（附图片）
