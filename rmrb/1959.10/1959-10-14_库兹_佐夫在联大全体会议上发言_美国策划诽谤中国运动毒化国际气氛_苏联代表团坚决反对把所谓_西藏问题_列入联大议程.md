Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 13th, TASS dispatch: Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke at the 14th UN General Assembly on October 12th. The full text is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen:

　　The Soviet delegation firmly opposes the General Affairs Committee's decision to include the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the agenda of the 14th UN General Assembly. There is no doubt that submitting this provocative issue to the United Nations is an attempt to throw us back into the worst era of the "Cold War." The proposals put forward by the Irish and Malayan delegations under discussion are precisely with this intention. In this regard, I agree with the speech made by the Indonesian representative here. However, we must, of course, distinguish between those who merely signed the letter and those who truly initiated the proposal of this issue.

　　The Soviet delegation believes that the General Assembly must first pay attention to the following situations:

　　The United Nations' discussion of the "Tibetan issue" is a blatant violation of the UN Charter

　　First, for an objective person, it should be clear that the United Nations' discussion of the "Tibetan issue" will be a blatant violation of the organization's charter, because the charter stipulates an absolute prohibition on the United Nations interfering in matters that fall within the internal jurisdiction of any country. Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter states:

　　"7. Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter…"

　　Who doesn't know that Tibet has been organically included in China's territory since ancient times, is an inseparable part of China, and is one of China's administrative regions. Under the new historical conditions, the issue of the status of Tibet as an autonomous region of China was clearly defined as early as May 23, 1951, in the "Agreement between the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" and in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and other representatives from Tibet actively participated in the formulation and adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which stipulates the principles of national policy, namely: guaranteeing national regional autonomy in the territory of the People's Republic of China. Various democratic measures are now being implemented in this region in strict accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the provisions of the aforementioned agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. These progressive measures, aimed at meeting the fundamental aspirations of the Tibetan people, are, in all respects, disliked by certain groups in certain countries. However, the implementation of such measures is a matter for the people and government of the People's Republic, and no one (including the United Nations) has the right to interfere. It can be seen that putting the "Tibetan issue" on the General Assembly's agenda is nothing more than a blatant and rude attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, an action that is clearly contrary to the UN Charter.

　　Second, the initiators of putting the "Tibetan issue" on the conference agenda, knowing that their plan is completely illegal and without legal basis, therefore cite the Declaration of Human Rights and use various hypocritical arguments about religious freedom, civil liberties, etc., in an attempt to conceal their attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. Those who organize shameful provocations together with the bankrupt Tibetan feudal lords are now fabricating and spreading various slanderous rumors.

　　Those who raise the "Tibetan issue" are defending the most backward, darkest, and most brutal serf system in the world.

　　But here a question arises: who are those who raise the so-called "Tibetan issue" protecting? They are defending the most backward, extremely dark, and extremely brutal social system in the world today. In this case, their talk of human rights is nothing more than the false benevolence of spokespersons for serfdom enslavement, nothing more than worrying about retaining the barbaric serf system in Tibet in various ways. Everyone knows that under this system, the monks, lamas, and feudal lords, who make up 5% of the Tibetan population, controlled all the land and other means of production, while the vast majority of residents have always lived in extreme poverty, darkness, and hunger.

　　The democratic reforms planned and already being implemented in Tibet are fully in line with the spirit and principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These reforms are precisely to realize the principles of the Declaration of Human Rights in Tibet as soon as possible, to end the brutal rule of a small number of serf owners, and to end the disenfranchised situation of the vast majority of the people. Like other measures implemented in Tibet, the preparatory work for the reforms was carried out with full consideration of the special conditions historically formed in Tibet, and was implemented by the Tibetans themselves. It can be seen that the aggressive groups' attempt to use the Declaration of Human Rights to achieve their goals when raising the "Tibetan issue" is untenable, and the planners of this clamor will suffer the consequences of their own actions.

　　In this regard, it should be pointed out that, to date, there is a vast field of activity in the world to express genuine, rather than false, humanitarian feelings, and to take measures to uphold the Declaration of Human Rights. However, these fields do not exist where they are now trying to find them. For example, we can point out to the representatives of Britain, Belgium, and some other countries who voted in the General Affairs Committee in favor of including the "Tibetan issue" on the agenda, in which territories racial discrimination is rampant and those who oppose the outdated and barbaric colonial system are brutally suppressed: in these territories, hundreds of millions of people are deprived of the most basic human rights, deprived of the possibility of arranging their lives according to their own will. Some examples have already been listed in this session, and if we are to talk about this topic, the examples are countless.

　　The US State Department uses the "Tibetan issue" to plot a smear campaign against China.

　　Gentlemen, let us open our eyes and look at the facts and speak frankly. The entire inside story and essence of raising the "Tibetan issue" is not out of concern for human rights at all. Those who raise the "Tibetan issue," first and foremost the US State Department, are conspiring to launch a vicious smear campaign against the great Chinese people and their government, with the aim of undermining, or at least hindering, the warming process that has recently begun in international relations. Everyone sees that the situation that has now formed is conducive to solving the various problems that poison international relations. Obstacles on the road to lasting peace are being cleared, and a new page in the history of human development is being opened—a page of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. This development is simply not to the taste of the enemies of peace and the executors of the "Cold War" policy. They raise the "Tibetan issue" on the platform of the United Nations in order to poison the atmosphere, hinder the relaxation of international tensions, and thus hinder the rapprochement between countries.

　　They are primarily attempting to undermine the fruitful cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Asian countries, to undermine the unity of the people of Asia and Africa, and their struggle to consolidate national independence and expand the Asia-Africa peace zone. All the provocative activities of the aggressive groups are merely tricks to alienate the relationship between the People's Republic of China and its neighboring countries and to create a complex situation between the People's Republic of China and all Asian countries. At the same time, they hope to drag the people of Asian countries into the "Cold War" and make them participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and other aggressive groups. However, it is futile to deceive the people of various countries who have recently broken free from colonial and semi-colonial dependence. The people of all countries are well aware that whether it is the actions planned by reactionaries in Tibet or the clamor that is being stirred up today at the United Nations around the artificially created "Tibetan issue," it is just one of the tricks of the aforementioned groups against the Bandung spirit and against the proposition of peaceful coexistence of all countries. It would be much better for the United Nations if delegations from all countries were committed to seeking solutions to the urgent international issues that have long been awaiting resolution.

　　Those who raise the "Tibetan issue" hope to use it to obstruct people's attention to the issue of complete and thorough disarmament.

　　Those who raise the "Tibetan issue" hope that raising this issue will also obstruct the productive work of the 14th UN General Assembly session, and will distract people from the truly important issues on the agenda, primarily the issue of complete and thorough disarmament. Including the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the agenda will undoubtedly seriously damage the credibility of the United Nations. Because of this action, the people of all countries will naturally ask the question: how long will this situation continue, in which the United Nations becomes a tool in the hands of those who are keen on the "Cold War" rather than a tool for promoting the strengthening of peace and friendship between countries? Very strange phenomena are occurring. The whole world sees that relations between countries are improving. At the same time, the UN General Assembly, through the UN, is forcibly passing and inciting issues aimed at maintaining and continuing the "Cold War" policy. We want to say openly and directly: if the United Nations hopes not to disappoint the expectations of the people of all countries, hopes to strengthen and move forward, rather than return to the shameful path of the moribund League of Nations, then it should become a truly international organization that helps to maintain and strengthen peace, and promote the spirit of consultation and cooperation between countries. The United Nations should abandon everything that hinders the cause of strengthening peace. Gentlemen, before voting in favor of or against including the artificially created "Tibetan issue" on the agenda, this should be seriously considered.

　　The Soviet delegation proposes to reject the General Affairs Committee's proposal to include the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the agenda, because the purpose of the so-called "Tibetan issue" is to push the United Nations onto the path of exacerbating relations between countries and onto the path of the bankrupt "Cold War" policy.

　　库兹?佐夫在联大全体会议上发言
    美国策划诽谤中国运动毒化国际气氛
    苏联代表团坚决反对把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社纽约13日电：苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫10月12日在第十四届联大全体会议上发言，全文如下：主席先生，各位先生：
    苏联代表团坚决反对总务委员会决定把所谓“西藏问题”列入第十四届联合国大会议程。毫无疑问，把这个具有挑衅性质的问题提交联合国，是企图把我们抛向“冷战”时期的最坏时代。讨论中的爱尔兰和马来亚代表团提出的建议正是抱着这个打算。在这方面，我赞同印度尼西亚代表在这里作的发言。不过，我们当然要把只是在信上签名的人和真正倡议提出这个问题的人区别开来。
    苏联代表团认为大会必须首先注意下列情况：
    联合国讨论“西藏问题”粗暴地违犯了联合国宪章
    第一，对一个客观的人来说，应该明白，联合国讨论“西藏问题”的做法将是粗暴地违犯这个组织的宪章，因为宪章规定绝对禁止联合国干涉属于任何国家内部管辖范围的事情。宪章第二条第七款中说：
    “七、本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决……”
    谁不知道，西藏自古以来就有机地列入中国的版图，是中国不可分割的一部分，是中国的行政区之一。在新的历史条件下，作为中国自治区的西藏的地位问题早已在1951年5月23日中华人民共和国“中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”和中华人民共和国的宪法中明文确定了。1954年，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏其他的代表都积极参加了中华人民共和国宪法的制订和通过工作，宪法中规定了民族政策的原则，这就是：保障中华人民共和国领土上的民族区域自治。切实根据中华人民共和国的宪法和上述和平解放西藏办法的协议的条款，现在正在这个地区实现着各种民主措施。以满足西藏人民的根本愿望为目的的这些进步措施，从各方面看来，是某些国家的某些集团所不喜欢的。但是，实现这种措施，是中华人民共和国人民和政府的事，任何人（包括联合国在内）都没有权利去干涉。由此可见，把“西藏问题”列入大会议程，不是别的，正是粗暴无礼地企图干涉中国的内政，这种行动显然是与联合国宪章相违背的。
    第二，把“西藏问题”列入会议议程上的发起者明知自己的打算是完全非法的和无法律根据的，因而便引用人权宣言和用各种关于宗教自由、公民自由等虚伪的论调来设法掩饰自己干涉中国内政的企图。同破了产的西藏封建主一道组织可耻的挑衅的人，现在正在编造和散布种种诬蔑性的?造。
    提出“西藏问题”的人是在维护世界上最落后、最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度
    但是，这里产生一个问题：提出所谓“西藏问题”的人是保护谁呢？他们维护的是现在世界上最落后的、极其黑暗的和极其残酷的社会制度。在这种情况下，他们谈论什么人权，这无非是农奴制奴役的代言人的假慈悲而已，无非是操心着用各种方式在西藏保留野蛮的农奴制而已。大家都知道，在这种制度下，占西藏居民5％的僧俗和封建主掌握了所有的土地和其他生产资料，而绝大多数的居民却一向过着极端贫困、黑暗和饥饿的日子。
    而在西藏筹划的、并已开始实行的民主改革却完全符合人权宣言的精神和原则。这些改革正是为了尽快地在西藏实现人权宣言的主张，结束一小撮农奴主的残暴统治，终止绝大多数人民大众的无权处境。同在西藏所实行的其他措施一样，改革的准备工作是在充分考虑到西藏在历史上形成的特殊条件的情况下进行的，而且是由西藏人自己实施的。由此可见，侵略集团在提出“西藏问题”时，企图利用人权宣言来达到自己的目的，是站不住脚的，而这种叫嚣的策划者要自食恶果。
    在这方面应该指出，迄今为止，在世界上大有活动天地去表现真正的、而不是虚伪的人道感情，去采取措施维护人权宣言。不过，这些天地不是存在于他们现在企图寻找的那儿。譬如，我们可以向英国、比利时以及在总务委员会里投票赞成把“西藏问题”列入议程的一些其他国家的代表指出，在哪些领土上猖獗地流行着种族歧视、残酷地镇压着那些反对过时的野蛮殖民制度的人：在这些领土上，千百万人被剥夺了最起码的人权，被剥夺了按照自己的意志安排生活的可能性，在本届会议上已经在这方面列举了一些事例，如果要谈这个题目的话，这方面的例证是不胜枚举的。
    美国国务院利用“西藏问题”策划一场诽谤中国的运动
    先生们，让我们睁眼看一看事实并直言不讳吧。提出“西藏问题”的全部内幕和全部实质完全不是出于对人权的关心。提出“西藏问题”的人、首先是美国国务院阴谋策划对伟大的中国人民及其政府掀起一场恶毒的诽谤宣传运动，其目的是破坏、或者最低限度是阻挠国际关系中最近已经开始了的转暖过程。大家都看到，现在已经形成的局面，有助于解决毒化国际关系的各项问题。正在清除通向持久和平的道路上的障碍，正在揭开人类发展史上新的一页——不同社会制度的各国和平共处的一页。这种发展怎么也不合和平的敌人、“冷战”政策的执行者的口胃。他们在联合国的讲台上提出“西藏问题”，是为了毒化气氛，阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，从而阻挠各国之间的接近。
    他们首先是企图破坏中华人民共和国和亚洲国家之间的富有成效的合作，破坏亚非各国人民的团结，以及他们争取巩固民族独立、争取扩大亚非和平地区的斗争。侵略集团的一切挑拨活动，只不过是为了离间中华人民共和国同它的邻国的关系，并且在中华人民共和国和亚洲所有国家之间制造复杂局面。同时，他们指望把亚洲各国人民拖入“冷战”，使他们参加东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织以及其他侵略集团。但是，对不久前摆脱了殖民地半殖民地从属地位的各国人民进行欺骗，那是徒劳无益的。各国人民很清楚，无论是反动分子在西藏策划的行动，无论是今天在联合国围绕人为制造的“西藏问题”所掀起的叫嚣，这只不过是上述集团反对万隆精神、反对所有国家和平共处的主张的伎俩之一而已。如果各国代表团都致力于谋求解决早就迫待解决的刻不容缓的国际问题，这对联合国来说就会更加有好处。
    提出“西藏问题”的人指望借此阻挠人们注意全面彻底裁军的问题
    提出“西藏问题”的人指望，提出这个问题也会阻挠第十四届联合国大会会议进行富有成效的工作，会使人不去注意列入议程中的真正重要的问题，首先就是关于全面彻底裁军的问题。将所谓“西藏问题”列入议程，无疑是会严重地打击联合国的威信。由于这种行径，各国人民很自然地会提出这样的问题：联合国成为热衷“冷战”者手中的工具，而不是促进加强和平和各国友谊的工具，这种情况究竟要继续到何时何日？正在发生着非常奇怪的现象。全世界都看到各国之间的关系正在改善。而在这同时，联合国大会却假联合国之手正在强行通过和煽动目的在于维持和继续执行“冷战”政策的问题。我们要开诚布公地、直截了当地说：如果联合国希望不辜负各国人民的期望，希望加强和向前发展，而不是回到寿终正寝的国联的可耻的道路去，那么，它就应当成为真正有助于维护和加强和平、发扬国与国之间的协商精神和合作的国际组织。联合国应当抛弃一切会妨碍加强和平事业的东西。先生们，在投票赞成或者反对把人为制造的“西藏问题”列入议程之前，应当严肃认真地考虑到这一点。
    苏联代表团建议摒弃总务委员会关于把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程的提案，因为所谓“西藏问题”，其目的是要把联合国推到加剧各国之间关系的道路上，推到破产了的“冷战”政策的道路上。
