Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 24th: In 98 large and medium-sized factories in Shaanxi, 1,450 youth classes (groups) and 27,413 young workers have overfulfilled their production plans for this year and are already working on tasks for 1960. Among them, some have even started working on tasks for 1961, 1962, and 1963.

"A mighty army moves together, advancing into 1960 at high speed"—this vibrant mass movement has been launched under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In this movement, leaders at all levels have paid great attention to planting red flags and establishing pacesetters. Incomplete statistics from Xi'an and Xianyang alone show that 713 collective pacesetters and 3,565 individual pacesetters have been established, ensuring that there are pacesetters in every trade and at every level. The vast number of young workers have risen up to catch up, launching a competition to "learn from pacesetters, catch up with pacesetters, and surpass pacesetters," causing production to rise sharply. At the Northwest State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, 90% of the 1,686 young workers in the competition overfulfilled their production plans, and more than 50% of them caught up with the factory-level pacesetters.

In this competition, the vast number of workers have moved from competing in output to a comprehensive competition of high output and high quality, achieving a double leap forward in both output and quality. At the Longxi Foundry's No. 12 Workshop, young machinists Peng Youqing, Wang Diwu, Ouyang Zili, and Zhe Hengli launched a competition against each other. Peng Youqing set a new record of 36 hours without producing any defective products, Wang Diwu exceeded Peng Youqing with 47 hours without defective products, and Ouyang Zili then set a new record with 62 hours without defective products. Finally, Zhe Hengli took the lead with a record of 85 hours without defective products.

Making every effort to innovate technology is the main method for the vast number of young workers to advance into 1960 ahead of schedule. According to statistics from 33 factories in Xi'an, from January to September, a total of 1,545 "blasting teams," shock brigades, and technical innovation groups were organized, with more than 18,000 people participating. From August to now, 24,725 technical innovations have been made, breaking through 4,610 key production bottlenecks. The "May Fourth" Youth Group at the Xi'an Machinery Manufacturing Plant implemented 104 innovation projects from March to August, breaking through 15 key production bottlenecks, and improving efficiency by one to three hundred times.

In order to enable more young workers to advance into 1960 ahead of schedule, the vast number of young workers have promoted the spirit of communism, helping and supporting each other, and advancing together. Young workers in many factories have widely launched activities to help backward collectives and individuals. According to statistics from 30 factories in Xi'an, 3,212 advanced producers have helped 3,080 backward young workers, bringing them close to or up to advanced levels. Many advanced collectives and individuals have also supported fraternal units and competitors with their innovative achievements, enabling everyone to improve together.

    陕西一千多个班二万多青工
    提前跨进一九六○年
    据新华社西安24日电　在陕西的九十八个大中型工厂中，目前已经有一千四百五十个青年班（组）和二万七千四百一十三名青年工人超额完成了今年的生产计划，正在做1960年的活。其中，有些人已经开始做1961年、1962年和1963年的活。
    “千军万马齐动员，高速度跨进1960年”，这个热火朝天的群众运动，是在党的八届八中全会的决议精神鼓舞下开展起来的。在这次运动中，各级领导都非常注意了插红旗、树标兵。仅西安和咸阳两个市的不完全的统计，就树起七百一十三个集体标兵和三千五百六十五个个人标兵，做到了行行有标兵，层层有标兵。广大青年工人奋起直追，开展了“学标兵，赶标兵，超标兵”的竞赛运动，使生产直线上升。西北国棉二厂的一千六百八十六名青年工人，在竞赛中有90％的人都超额完成了生产计划，50％以上的人都赶上了厂级的标兵。
    广大职工在这场竞赛中，已由赛产量发展到高产优质的全面竞赛，做到产量质量双跃进。陇西铸造厂十二车间的青年车工彭有清、王迪武、欧阳自立、哲恒利四人在开展对手赛中，彭有清以三十六小时无废品首创新纪录，王迪武以四十七小时无废品超过彭有清，欧阳自立又以六十二小时无废品创新纪录；最后，哲恒利以八十五小时无废品的成绩领先。
    千方百计革新技术，是广大青工提前跨进1960年的主要方法。据西安市三十三个工厂的统计，1至9月份共组织了一千五百四十五个生产关键“爆破队”、突击队和技术革新小组，有一万八千多人参加。从8月份到现在，就革新技术二万四千七百二十五件，突破生产关键四千六百一十个。西安机械制造厂“五四”青年小组，3月至8月份实现了一百零四个革新项目，攻破了十五项生产关键，分别提高工效一倍至三百倍。
    为了使更多的青年工人提前跨进1960年，广大青年工人发扬了共产主义的精神，互相帮助，互相支援，共同前进。许多工厂的青年工人都广泛地开展了帮助后进集体和个人的活动。据西安市三十个厂的统计，有三千二百一十二个先进生产者帮助三千零八十个后进青年工人，接近或赶上了先进水平。还有很多先进集体和个人，把自己革新的成果支援兄弟单位和竞赛对手，使大家共同提高。
