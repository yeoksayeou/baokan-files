	Along the beautiful banks of the Jinsha River, ascending the majestic Wumeng Mountain, the autumn sky is clear and the red flags flutter. The heroic People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, on the basis of completing the road construction task for September five days ahead of schedule, are advancing victoriously and launching a great battle, "Striving for a full house in October to welcome the National Heroes Conference."
	The Wumeng Mountain, at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, is where our great leader Chairman Mao led the Red Army, and once wrote the magnificent poem "The Wumeng mountains surge, like rolling mud balls." Today, the Wumeng Mountain has become the throat of the two new railway projects in Yunnan-Guizhou and Neikun. The railway soldiers must split the Wumeng Mountain and build the railway onto the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.
	The Wumeng Tianxian - "Tiansheng Bridge," lies across the Kedu River between Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. To the east is the cliff "Lion's Mouth" and to the west is the precipice "Tiger's Jaw". Its position is such that "the peaks reaching to the sky are not an inch apart, and the dry trees hang upside down against the cliff." It makes people feel chilled! When the railway soldiers came here, the Yi elders at the foot of the mountain told them: Millions of years ago, there was a ferocious "Uncrossable River" here, which cut off traffic between the two banks, preventing young men and women from meeting even if they loved each other. Fortunately, a fairy saw the deep suffering of the people and moved mountains to fill the river, pressing the "Uncrossable River" under the mountain and turning it into the "Crossable River." The mountain was then called "Tiansheng Bridge." However, the evil god of Wumeng Mountain sent fierce lions and tigers to guard it and did not let go of pedestrians. So the fairy's efforts were in vain. However, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army flew over the Wumeng Tianxian and eliminated the guarding enemy.
	Today, the old Red Army soldier and regimental commander Liu Qingpu led the road construction army to set up a battlefield here again, fighting the "Lion's Mouth" and chiseling open the "Tiger's Jaw." The "Tiger's Jaw" has the "Fairy Cave" above it and the Kedu River below it, and it is impossible to climb. A year ago, two leopards fought on it and fell off the cliff to their deaths. The railway soldiers here have to excavate a tunnel more than 2,600 meters long and build a bridge 70 meters high and 525 meters long to allow the train to fly over the dangerous pass!
	Communist Party member and platoon leader Zhang Shengsheng led six Communist Party soldiers to climb the cliffs and take risks. This people's hero, who had made seventeen contributions on the transportation line of the Korean battlefield and during the railway construction of the motherland, was full of courage. He led his comrades, one after another, one step and one steel drill, clinging to the cliff and climbing upward. Squad leader and advanced producer He Qinxin took the lead and climbed up. Zhang Shengsheng came and went to meet them, quickly nailed the steel drills on the cliff, pulled the rope, and fastened the hanging board. So, the heroes wore safety ropes around their waists, stepped on swing boards, and swung sledgehammers to fire on the rocks. Below them were the rushing torrents with splashing waves, mountain eagles circling halfway up the cliff, and clusters of white clouds passing by them from time to time. After days of hard work, the road construction heroes finally split the Tiger's Jaw of Tianxian in half and cut out a transportation road on the thousand-foot cliff, allowing vehicles loaded with road-building and bridge-building machinery and materials to drive up the mountain in a steady stream.
	The overall project to conquer Wumeng Tianxian has been launched.
	The Yi people smiled and brought water peaches to the road-building soldiers; the Miao migrant workers sang while working: "The moon on the fifteenth is round and round, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is full of mountains; the Liberation Army has made great contributions, why build roads on high mountains?..." The soldiers climbed on the cliffs, opened their bronze-colored chests, and swung their sledgehammers in response: "You sing the moon, I sing the mountain, the mountains lock Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan; build a happy road for the people, sweat all over our bodies but our hearts are sweet!"
	In the tense engineering headquarters, we interviewed Division Commander Wang Zumei. He followed Chairman Mao on the Long March and was once the commander of the Red Army's "Vanguard Battalion" that fought here. The slogans written on the walls of the mountain villages by the Red Army in those years, the songs of the Yi people praising the Red Army, and every plant and tree in the Wumeng mountainous area all evoked his deep and happy memories. The division commander also met his landlord, Zhang Da, whom he had not seen for twenty-four years. Zhang Da was seventy years old, stroking his snow-white beard, squinting his eyes in surprise, and could hardly recognize that this was the young Red Army battalion commander. At that time, he wore a red star octagonal hat, a pair of old straw sandals, his face was full of red light, and he spoke with a Jiangxi accent. Now, he has wrinkles all over his forehead and white hair. Only those bright eyes are still the same as they were back then. The old man said with tears in his eyes: "Old Wang, you've been gone for more than twenty years. Chairman Mao and you are still thinking about us and have run back to build railways in these high mountains and ridges. I really didn't expect it!" The division commander smiled and said, "Uncle Zhang! Do you still remember how difficult the Long March was? We had already made a wish that after building a new China, we would definitely turn around and build a railway."
	The railway soldiers fought on the thousands of miles of construction site with the spirit of "moving mountains and filling the sea." At the Beikai Zhuxia construction site in Wumeng Mountain, there are several mountain peaks standing staggered, and dense clouds and fog engulf the top of the mountain. As the railway passes through this complex terrain, it is necessary to open up seventeen tunnels and build ten bridges on a fourteen-kilometer mountain road. The train will be out of the tunnel and over the bridge, and over the bridge and into the tunnel again. The soldiers set up three or four lines of defense here. Mountains and mountain bottoms, clouds and mist, are full of people, and the red flags of battle are flying. The roar of the machines and the clang of the hammers resounded through the valley. The booming of the cannons blasted the mountains, and rocks flew everywhere.
	The work of tunneling is very difficult. Standing in front of the soldiers are hard granite layers, soft soil and gravel, as well as dark coal seams and strangely shaped "caves." It is impossible to do it without carrying forward a tenacious fighting spirit and adopting advanced construction methods. The "Tiger Company," which was famous in the Taihang Mountains and the Lvliang Mountains during the Liberation War, held high the red flag of "attacking like a tiger and defending like Mount Tai," launched mechanized construction, and fought a great battle in the "Underground Corridor" on the Neikun Line - the more than 2,500-meter-long Qiewu Grand Tunnel. Since Red May, it has continuously created "Daily Red, Monthly Red" and pioneered the new record of one hundred meters per month. In the Banuo Kuai tunnel project, as soon as the "Sharp Knife Company" entered the cave, it fought bravely against coal seams, weathered rocks, and groundwater. The soldiers' clothes were wet every day, and their yellow military uniforms turned black. They successively overcame 189 collapses, still worked safely, and completed the task excellently with an overfulfillment of 44% in the "Great Battle to Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" in September.
	The soldiers who built bridges in the deep canyons are even braver than eagles, climbing on cloud ladders and speeding up construction. The famous "Yang Liandi Company" and its fraternal companies worked together to build the Miandian Bridge, which is 40 meters high and more than 150 meters long. Company Commander Hu Zhanfang, a close comrade-in-arms of the martyr Yang Liandi, the hero of climbing, led all the soldiers of the company and stated that under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they must victoriously complete the glorious task of bridge construction. A heated labor competition was launched between each class, each platoon, and individual, and major technological innovations were made. When more than 40 soldiers and migrant workers climbed the cliffs and carried sand and gravel, the supply could not meet the demand. Liu Jike, the platoon leader and Communist Party member who had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and won a great achievement for moving a time bomb on the transportation line, pondered day and night, boldly created, ran straight from the steep cliff to the bottom of the valley, and built an aerial ropeway, allowing the wooden buckets of "flying in the sky" full of sand and gravel to quickly transport the sand and gravel to the bridge piers. In this way, only eight people are needed to meet the supply of sand and gravel. Then, the advanced method of "steel tower frame pouring concrete" was adopted, which increased the engineering efficiency by 50%. The entire company completed the task of the Great September Battle thirteen days ahead of schedule.
	On the Nanpan River, the soldiers of the Fifth Company entered the water to build bridges. They wrote on the red flag: "Hold high the bright banner of Mao Zedong and build a bridge of happiness!"
	Here, the river is rolling and the river bank is steep. Squad leader and Communist Party member Peng Nanzhan and eight water-savvy comrades took off their clothes and jumped into the rapids to rush to build the cofferdam. The water was rapid and the waves were high, and they could not stand firmly. They tied one end of the rope to their waists and the other end to the stone cliff on the river bank. The biting cold current froze their teeth, and the comrades on the shore quickly pulled them ashore, lit a bonfire, warmed their bodies, and then jumped into the river again to continue the battle. Seeing that the cofferdam was about to be built, it was washed away by a heavy rain and flood. So, Peng Nanzhan and other "nine warriors" went into the water again, once, twice, three times... until the sixth time, they finally rushed to build the wooden cofferdam, resisting the "flood dragon" and making the large iron bridge across the Nanpan River successfully completed.
	The people on both sides of the Nanpan River composed a new mountain song, praising the heroic railway soldiers:
	"The moon comes out bright and bright,
	A rainbow hangs over the Nanpan River;
	Why hang the rainbow?
	Miao girls!
	Ride the rainbow to Beijing."

　　铁道兵大战云贵高原
　　新华社记者　姜庆肇　夏维扬
    沿着美丽的金沙江畔，登上巍峨的乌蒙山巅，秋高气爽，红旗飘飘。英雄的人民解放军铁道兵部队，在提前五天完成9月份筑路任务的基础上，乘胜猛进，展开大战，“争取10月满堂红，迎接全国群英会”。
    海拔两千多米的乌蒙山，是我们的伟大领袖毛主席率领红军走过的地方，曾经写下了“乌蒙磅礴走泥丸”的雄壮诗篇。今天，乌蒙山成为滇黔和内昆两大新建铁路工程的咽喉，铁道兵战士们要劈开乌蒙山，把铁路架上云贵高原。
    乌蒙天险——“天生桥”，横在云贵两省中间的可渡河上，它东有悬崖“狮子口”，西有绝壁“老虎咀”，其势“连峰去天不盈尺，枯树倒挂倚绝壁”，行人心寒！当铁道兵战士们来到这里的时候，山下的彝族老人告诉他们：在千万年前，这里有一条凶恶的“不可渡河”，隔绝两岸交通，使青年男女相爱而不得相会。幸有一位仙女见人民苦情深重，移山填河，把“不可渡河”压到山下，变成“可渡河”，大山便叫“天生桥”。可是乌蒙山的恶神派来凶狮和猛虎镇守，不放过行人，于是仙女也白费力气。可是当年工农红军就飞越乌蒙天险，消灭了把关的敌人。
    今天，老红军战士、团长刘清浦率领筑路大军，又在这儿摆下战场，大战“狮子口”，凿开“老虎咀”。“老虎咀”上面是“神仙洞”，下面是可渡河，不可攀越。一年前，曾有两只豹子在上面打架，摔到崖下跌死。铁道兵战士们在这里要开挖两千六百多米长的隧道，架起一座高七十米、长五百二十五米的桥梁，使火车飞渡天险！
    共产党员、排长张生胜，带领六个共产党员战士，攀崖走险。这位曾经在朝鲜战场的运输线上和参加祖国铁路建设中，立过十七次功劳的人民英雄，浑身是胆。他领着战友，一个跟着一个，一步一钢钎，紧贴着绝壁向上爬。六班长、先进生产者何勤心一马当先，攀登上去。张生胜往来接应，迅速地在绝壁上钉下钢钎，拉开绳索，拴上吊板。于是，英雄们腰拴保险索，脚踏秋千板，手抡大锤向岩石开火。他们的眼下是浪花飞溅的激流，崖半腰盘旋着山鹰，一团团白云不时地在他们身边掠过。经过连日奋战，筑路英雄们终于把天险的老虎咀一劈两半，在千尺绝壁上切出一条运输公路，让满载筑路架桥的机械、物资的车辆，源源开上山来。
    征服乌蒙天险的全面工程展开了。
    彝族人民笑开颜，给筑路战士送来水蜜桃；苗族民工一面工作一面唱道：“十五的月亮圆又圆，云贵高原山上山；解放大军功劳大，高山修路为哪般？……”战士们攀在悬崖上，敞开古铜色的胸膛，抡动着大锤应唱着：“你唱月亮我唱山，重山锁住滇黔川；为民修条幸福路，满身大汗心里甜！”
    在紧张的工程指挥部里，我们访问了师长汪祖美。他是跟随毛主席长征，曾经在这儿战斗过的红军“尖兵营”营长。当年红军写在山寨墙壁上的标语，彝族人民赞颂红军的歌声，乌蒙山区的一草一木，都唤起他深沉、幸福的回忆。师长还会见了他阔别二十四年的房东张大爹。张大爹七十挂零，捋着雪白的胡须，眯着惊喜的眼睛，简直认不出这就是那位当年年轻的红军营长。那时候，他头戴红星八角帽，脚穿一双旧草鞋，满面红光，操着一口江西话。现在，他满额绉纹，头有白发。只是那对明亮的眼睛，还如同当年。老人家闪着泪花：“老汪呵，走了二十多年，毛主席和你们还想着我们，又跑回来在这高山大岭修铁道，真是没有想到啊！”师长微笑说：“张大爹！还记得吗？长征的路多难走。我们早就许过愿，打出个新中国，就一定转回头来修条铁路。”
    铁道兵战士们以“移山填海”的气概，奋战在千里工地上。在乌蒙山的背开柱下工地，有好几座山峰交错屏立，浓密的云雾吞没山顶。铁路穿过这复杂的地形，要在十四公里的山路上，凿开十七条隧道，筑起十座桥梁。火车将是出了洞就过桥，过了桥又钻洞。战士们在这儿摆下三、四层阵线。山上山下，云里雾中，都布满了人群，飘扬着战斗的红旗。机器的吼叫声和铁锤的叮当声，响澈山谷。轰轰的炮声把山岭炸得乱石横飞。
    开凿隧道的工程，十分艰巨。横在战士们面前的是坚硬的英岩层，松软的土夹石，还有漆黑的煤层和奇形怪状的“溶洞”。不发扬顽强的战斗精神和采取先进的施工方法，是不行的。曾经在解放战争中扬名太行山、吕梁山上的“老虎连”，高举“攻如猛虎，守如泰山”的红旗，展开机械化施工，大战内昆线上的“地下长廊”——两千五百多米的且乌大隧道，从红五月以来，连创“日日红，月月红”，并首创一个月百米成峒的新纪录。在扒挪块隧道工程中，“尖刀连”一进洞，就和煤层、风化石、地下水英勇搏斗。战士们的衣服天天是湿的，黄军装变成黑色。他们先后战胜一百八十九次塌方，依然安全施工，在“向建国十周年献礼”的九月大战中，以超额44％，出色地完成了任务。
    在深川峡谷间架桥的战士们，更勇如雄鹰，攀登在云梯上，加速施工。著名的“杨连第连”和兄弟连队一起，架设高四十米、长一百五十多米的面店大桥。连长——登高英雄杨连第烈士生前的亲密战友胡占芳，率领全连战士，表示在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，一定要胜利完成架桥的光荣任务。各班各排和个人之间都展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛，并大闹技术革新。当四十多名战士和民工爬崖走壁，担运砂料供不应求时，曾经参加抗美援朝在运输线上搬走定时炸弹而荣立大功的排长、共产党员刘继珂，便日夜琢磨，大胆创造，从陡削的山崖直通到谷底，架起一条空中索道，让满载砂料的“天上飞”木斗，把砂料迅速地运到桥墩上。这样，只需要八个人，就满足了砂料的供应。接着，又采用“钢塔架灌注混凝土”的先进方法，又把工程效率提高50％。全连提前十三天完成了9月大战的任务。
    南盘江上，第五连的战士们入水架桥。他们在红旗上写着：“高举毛泽东的光辉旗帜，架起幸福的桥梁！”
    这儿，江水滚滚，江岸陡峭。九班长，共产党员彭南栈，和八个会水的战友，脱光衣服，跳进急流，抢筑围堰。水急浪高，站不住脚。他们便用绳索的一头拴在腰间，另一头锚到江岸石崖上，刺骨的寒流，冻得他们牙齿打颤，岸上的战友们赶忙拉他们上岸，燃起篝火，暖暖身子，接着又跳下江水，继续战斗。眼看围堰快要筑成了，却又被一场大雨和洪水冲得无影无踪。于是，彭南栈等“九勇士”再次下水，一次、二次、三次……一直到第六次，才终于把木制围堰抢筑起来，抵住“蛟龙”，使横跨南盘江的大铁桥顺利建成。
    南盘江两岸的人民，编出一首新的山歌，歌颂英雄的铁道兵：
    “月亮出来明又明，
    南盘江上挂彩虹；
    挂起彩虹为哪样？
    苗家姑娘啊！
    骑上长虹到北京。”
