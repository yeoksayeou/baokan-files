Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, New Delhi Dispatch: The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a communiqué on the 23rd, giving a distorted account of the October 20th and 21st incidents in which Indian troops invaded Chinese territory and carried out armed provocations, and attempting to shift the responsibility for the incident onto China.

In order to cover up the Indian troops' deliberate violation of the Chinese border and armed attack, the communiqué described the course of events as follows: On October 20th, the Indian police patrol sent a group to search for two policemen who had been patrolling near Kongka Pass and had not returned that afternoon. The search was unsuccessful, and on the morning of the next day, a detachment of the Indian patrol continued to patrol to continue the search. The communiqué stated, "It appears that this force was suddenly attacked by intense gunfire from Chinese troops stationed on the mountaintop. In self-defense, the Indian force retaliated, but the Chinese outnumbered them and outmatched them with grenades and mortars, resulting in seventeen deaths and three serious injuries."

According to the communiqué, "The Indian government does not station troops in this area. The Indian police force has been carrying out its normal patrol duties, and in the past few years, they have patrolled the entire area without obstruction."

The communiqué completely ignores the fact that in September 1958 and July 1959, Indian armed personnel twice illegally intruded into Chinese territory in this section of the border and were disarmed and detained by Chinese border troops, and the Chinese government expressed regret and lodged protests with the Indian government on both occasions.

The communiqué even stated, "The Indian government reserves the right to demand full compensation from the Chinese government upon learning the exact extent of the losses."

The communiqué from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also stated that the Indian government "did not accept the protests raised in the Chinese memorandum" and on the 23rd lodged a "strong protest" with the Chinese government regarding this incident.

Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, New Delhi Dispatch: Some right-wing newspapers in India have been publishing distorted reports and making attacking statements about China for days regarding the incident in which Indian armed personnel invaded the Kongka Pass area of China and carried out armed provocations.

On the 24th, these newspapers published the completely untrue communiqué issued by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on the 23rd regarding this incident on the front page with page-spanning, black and white sensational headlines. "The Statesman"'s headline was: "Chinese Massacre Indian Patrol in Ladakh". "Hindustan Standard"'s headline was: "New Aggression in Ladakh Area". "The Hindustan Times"' headline was: "Chinese Troops Kill Seventeen in Ladakh, Invade Indian Territory Forty Miles".

These newspapers also published sensational and misleading statements in an attempt to incite Indian public sentiment. "The Times of India" in a news item falsely accused "China's crossing the border is an organized action," and even said that "it seems that China is beginning to implement a deliberate plan to occupy by force what they claim is their territory in Ladakh." This newspaper also falsely claimed that "the soothing words spoken by Chinese leaders in recent weeks have proven to be deceptive."

"The Statesman," run by the British, even said, "In Ladakh, the Chinese are simply crazy, they killed personnel of the Indian police force who only had light weapons." It seized the opportunity to incite that the reaction in Delhi political circles was "both angry and anxious," and "it may trigger a movement, causing people to put pressure on the Indian government to take stronger action." This newspaper also said that the Indian government will "find it difficult to resist public pressure to break off diplomatic relations with China."

The "Hindustan Standard" also attacked China's self-defense action in repelling the Indian armed personnel's cross-border provocation in an editorial on the 25th, saying it was a manifestation of "deliberate barbarity and aggressive conspiracy" and was "adding fuel to the fire" of already strained Sino-Indian relations.

At the same time, some Indian right-wing parties and their leaders also took advantage of this incident to stir up trouble and attack China. The Bharatiya Jana Sangh held a rally in Delhi on the 25th and passed a resolution slandering China, saying that this incident was "part of a planned aggression by China along the northern border of India" and demanded "joint defense" with Pakistan.

Some leaders of the newly formed right-wing party Swatantra Party also made speeches in South India, demanding "the lifting of all restrictions on the border guards" and taking "strong action" against China.

### 印度外交部就空喀山口事件发表公报  歪曲事实真相企图转嫁责任  印度右翼报刊和政党领袖乘机攻击我国

    印度外交部就空喀山口事件发表公报
    歪曲事实真相企图转嫁责任
    印度右翼报刊和政党领袖乘机攻击我国
    新华社26日讯　新德里消息：印度外交部在23日发表了一项公报，对10月20日和21日印度军队侵入中国领土进行武装挑衅的事件，作了歪曲事实的报道，并且企图反过来把这次事件的责任推到中国身上。
    为了掩盖印度军队蓄意侵犯中国边境并且进行武装攻击，公报把事件的过程说成是：10月20日，印度警察巡逻队派出一批人去寻找在空喀山口附近进行巡逻而当天下午没有回来的两个警察。寻找没有结果，在第二天上午，印度巡逻队的一个分遣队继续巡逻以继续寻找。公报说，“看来，这支部队遭到了守在山顶上的中国军队突然发射猛烈的炮火袭击。这支印度部队为了自卫，进行回击，但是中国人由于有着占优势的兵力和使用手榴弹和迫击炮而胜过他们，使十七人死亡，另外三人受重伤。”
    据公报说，“印度政府没有在这个地区派驻军队。印度警察队一直在执行他们正常的巡逻任务，在过去几年中，他们畅通无阻地在整个地区进行巡逻。”
    公报完全无视这样的事实：在1958年9月和1959年7月，印度武装人员曾经在这一段边界两度非法侵入中国领土而被中国边防部队解除武装和扣押，中国政府还曾经为此向印度政府分别表示遗憾和提出抗议。
    公报竟然说，“印度政府保留在得知损失的确切程度时，要求中国政府给予充分赔偿的权利。”
    印度外交部的公报又说，印度政府
  “没有接受中国备忘录中所提出的抗议”，并且在23日就这一事件向中国政府提出了“强硬抗议”。
    新华社26日讯　新德里消息：印度一些右翼报刊连日就印度武装人员侵入中国空喀山口地区进行武装挑衅的事件，发表歪曲事实的报道和攻击中国的言论。
    24日，这些报刊在头版用横贯全页的颠倒黑白的标题，刊载了印度外交部23日发表的关于这一事件的完全不符合事实的公报。“政治家报”的标题是：“中国人屠杀拉达克的印度巡逻队”。“印度斯坦旗报”的标题是：“拉达克地区发生新的侵略”。“印度斯坦时报”的标题是：“中国军队在拉达克打死十七人，侵入印度领土四十英里”。
    这些报纸还刊登了耸人听闻和混淆视听的言论，企图煽动印度公众的情绪。“印度时报”在一条消息中反诬“中国越过边境是有组织的行动”，还说什么“看来中国是开始执行一项处心积虑的计划，用武力来占领他们声称是他们在拉达克的领土”。这家报纸并且诬蔑说，“中国领袖们最近几周来所讲的语气缓和的话，已经证明是骗人的东西。”
    英国人办的“政治家报”竟然说，“在拉达克，中国简直是发疯了，他们杀死了只有轻武器的印度警察队的人员。”它乘机煽动说，德里政界的反应是“既愤怒又焦虑”，“它可能引起一次运动，引起人们对印度政府施加压力，要它采取比较强硬的行动。”这家报纸还说，印度政府将“很难抵抗公众要求同中国断绝外交关系的压力。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”25日在社论中也攻击中国这次反击印度武装人员越境挑衅的自卫行动，是表现了“处心积虑的野蛮和侵略性的阴谋”，是对已经紧张的中印关系“火上加油”。
    与此同时，一些印度右翼政党及其首领也借这次事件兴风作浪，攻击中国。印度人民同盟25日在德里举行集会通过诽谤中国的决议，说这次事件是中国在印度“北部边境沿线进行的有计划的侵略的一部分”，并且要求同巴基斯坦进行“联防”。
    新成立的右翼政党自由党的一些首领也在南印度发表演说，要求“取消对边防军的一切限制”，对中国采取“强硬行动”。
