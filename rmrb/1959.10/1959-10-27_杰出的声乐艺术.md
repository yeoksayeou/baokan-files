Outstanding Vocal Art
　　Yu Yixuan
　　The debut recital of soprano Christa Maria Ziese and tenor Wieland Kluttig, singers from the German Democratic Republic, at the National Culture Palace in the capital, was unanimously praised by the Beijing audience. The two singers impressed us deeply with their outstanding talents. First of all, we thank the German artists for their enthusiasm in systematically introducing us to the classic works of German art songs. The program included works by Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Strauss. They selected the finest masterpieces from these masters' art songs. Beethoven's early work "How Splendid is Nature," which has a Mozartian style, the tenderly affectionate "I Love You," and the humorously interesting "Kiss," these three refined works were performed by Christa Maria Ziese with superb vocal technique and profound inner feelings, fully expressing the content of the works and Beethoven's sincere artistic ideas. She sang out Beethoven's love for nature and life. In the song "Kiss," she perfectly achieved subtle changes in timbre and emotion, vividly bringing to life the innocent, lovely, shy shepherdess Chloe in the song, which is rare in the performance of art songs.
　　Beethoven's sixty-seven art songs, although a small part of his vast oeuvre, are enough for the composer to occupy an immortal place in vocal works with just "Adelaide" and "To the Distant Beloved." These two works embody Beethoven's achievements in boldly exploring new methods of song writing, breaking through the old song forms of the time. Therefore, in terms of the development significance of the song form, "Adelaide" has a historical originality. And "To the Distant Beloved," which we are familiar with and love, is the first vocal song cycle in history. Wieland Kluttig perfectly sang these two historically significant vocal masterpieces with his bright voice and skillful technique, which was indeed the greatest artistic enjoyment for the Chinese audience who love music.
　　In the Schubert works in the program, the singers carefully arranged four different types of pieces: "Whither?," "The Question," "Faith in Spring," and "You Are Rest," Christa Maria Ziese accurately expressed Schubert's diversified and beautiful musical structure with her high artistic accomplishment and excellent realistic techniques. "You Are Rest" and Brahms' "Field Solitude" are typical art songs with the most technical difficulty. When Christa Maria Ziese sang the large interval movements in these two songs, she used the calmest breathing method to maintain the beautiful melody. She sang smooth legato to express a quiet atmosphere, and also mastered the larger interval leaps to express inner turmoil. To achieve the unity of these two is a great test for a singer, but Christa Maria Ziese's calm and natural performance reached a seamless, poetic realm, which is admirable!
　　In Schumann's works, the dramatic, sorrowful "I Bear No Grudge" and the folk-flavored, cheerful traveler's song "Well, Drink Up This Cup," Wieland Kluttig simply portrayed the poet's suffering in love and the traveler's broad mind. He fully revealed his outstanding artistic talent and his unique artistic creation in expressing Schumann's works.
　　In the final Strauss works, we once again felt the meticulous consideration made by the German artists in arranging the program. "Be Still, My Soul" and "Zueignung" are the two most mature works created during Strauss's fruitful middle period. Wieland Kluttig sang out the pain of a person who has experienced the hardships of the world, and the desire to obtain peace in the former song, and the poet's passion for confessing love to his lover in the latter song with clear and accurate diction, and infectious singing. In Wieland Kluttig's passionate singing, the last song on the program was perfectly ended.
　　The success of Christa Maria Ziese and Wieland Kluttig's recital is inseparable from Professor Heinz Bongartz, the conductor of the Dresden Symphony Orchestra and an outstanding artist, who played the piano accompaniment. How much music is contained in his accompaniment! The bright singing, the profound meaning of the words, and the soft and powerful piano sound harmoniously became a wonderful whole, creating the unparalleled pure artistic peak of classical chamber music! We thank the three artists and the government and people of the German Democratic Republic with the most respectful feelings for bringing the finest musical art and the most sincere friendship to the Chinese people.

    杰出的声乐艺术

    德意志民主共和国歌唱家女高音克莱斯特·玛丽亚·齐塞和男高音维尔克莱德·克路克在首都民族文化宫的首次独唱会，获得了北京听众的一致赞扬。两位歌唱家以杰出的才华给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们首先感谢德国艺术家们的热诚，他们把德国艺术歌曲的经典作品，向我们作了系统的介绍。节目中包括了贝多芬、舒伯特、舒曼、勃拉姆斯和斯特劳斯的作品，他们选择了这些大师们的艺术歌曲中的最优秀的代表作，带有莫扎特风格的贝多芬的早期作品“大自然多么壮丽”，和充满柔情蜜意的“我爱你”，以及诙谐有趣的“吻”这三首精炼的作品中，克·玛·齐塞以高度的声乐技巧，深刻的内心感受，充分地表达了作品内容和贝多芬的诚挚的艺术思想。她唱出了贝多芬对大自然和生活的热爱。在“吻”一曲中，完善地做到了音色上和感情上的细致变化，把歌曲中的那位天真可爱的、初恋的、羞怯的牧羊女克罗埃生动地活现在听众面前，这在艺术歌曲的表现上是难能可贵的。
    贝多芬的六十七首艺术歌曲，虽然是他的大量创作中的一小部分，而单是“阿达拉依达”和“致远方的恋人”就足够使作曲家在声乐作品中占有不朽的地位。这两部作品体现了贝多芬在探索新的歌曲写作方法上大胆尝试的成就，突破了当时的旧的歌曲形式，因而就歌曲形式的发展意义来说，“阿达拉依达”具有历史性的首创性。而我们所熟悉和喜爱的“致远方的恋人”又是历史上第一部声乐套曲。维·克路克以他嘹亮的歌喉和纯熟的技巧完善地演唱了这两部具有历史意义的声乐杰作，这对热爱音乐的中国听众来说，确是一次最大的艺术享受。
    节目中的舒伯特作品，歌唱家精细地安排了四个不同类形的曲子：“到哪里去”、“疑问”、“春天的信念”和“你就是安静”，克·玛·齐塞以高度的艺术修养和卓越的现实手法，准确地表达了舒伯特的多样化的美妙的曲式结构。“你就是安静”和勃拉姆斯的“田野上的寂静”是艺术歌曲中技术性最强的典型作品。克·玛·齐塞在演唱这两首歌曲上下移动很大的音程时，运用了最平静的呼吸方法来保持着优美的曲调进行。她唱出了平稳的连音来表达一种安静的气氛，又很好地掌握了跳动较大的音程来表现出内心的动荡，要做到这两者的统一，对于一个歌唱家来说是一个莫大的考验，而克·玛·齐塞从容自如的表演达到了天衣无缝的诗一般的境界，令人赞叹不已！
    舒曼作品中的戏剧性的、悲痛的“我不怨恨”，和民歌风味的、开朗的旅行者之歌“好吧，还喝干了这一杯”两曲，维·克路克都朴实地刻划了诗人在恋爱中所受到的痛苦和旅行者的开阔的心境，他在表达舒曼的作品中充分显露了他的出色的艺术才能和他的艺术创造的独到之处。
    在最后斯特劳斯的作品中，我们再一次体会到德国艺术家们在安排节目时所作出的细致考虑。“平静吧，我的灵魂”和“吉西丽娅”是斯特劳斯中年时期创作丰收时的两首最成熟的作品，维·克路克以清晰而准确的吐词咬字方法，富有感染力的歌声，唱出了前一曲中的一个历尽尘世艰辛的人的痛苦，希求得到安静的愿望，和后一曲中一个诗人对恋人倾吐爱情的热情。在维·克路克热情奔放的歌声中，完满地结束了节目单上最后的一首歌曲。
    克·玛·齐塞和维·克路克独唱会的成功，与钢琴伴奏德累斯顿交响乐团团长、杰出的艺术家海因兹·波恩格兹教授是分不开的。在他的伴奏中蕴藏着多少音乐！光亮的歌声，深刻的词意，与柔美有力的钢琴声音谐和地成为一个美妙的整体，创造了古典室内乐无比纯正的艺术高峰！我们以最尊敬的心情感谢三位艺术家，和德意志民主共和国政府和人民为中国人民带来了最优秀的音乐艺术和最热诚的友谊。
