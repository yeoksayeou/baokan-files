Xinhua News Agency, October 6th, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket is continuing its flight towards the moon. At 20:00 Moscow time on October 5th, the rocket was 284,000 kilometers away from Earth, located above the Atlantic region, with coordinates of 20 degrees 40 minutes South latitude and 21 degrees 30 minutes West longitude.

The Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket continues to accurately follow its predetermined orbit.

Preliminary analysis of telemetry data obtained from the second measurement on October 4th confirms that the temperature regulation system, power supply, and scientific investigation instruments installed on the automatic interplanetary station are working normally.

From 15:00 to 17:00 Moscow time on October 5th, the automatic interplanetary station, under ground control, broadcasted the data from this remote measurement, which has been recorded by ground stations.

The next time the automatic interplanetary station will broadcast scientific measurement data to Earth is from 17:00 to 19:00 Moscow time on October 6th.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 6th (reporter Li Nan): To understand the significance of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket launched on the 4th, the reporter interviewed Kukarkin, a well-known Soviet scientist and Vice President of the International Astronomical Union. He said that the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket stopped sending back scientific information after passing near the moon. The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket existed in space for a very short time, and it also stopped sending scientific information after reaching the moon. Both of these cosmic rockets sent back scientific information for only one and a half days. The Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket eliminates this shortcoming. As long as the automatic interplanetary station exists for one day, it will send back one day's worth of scientific information. If it orbits the moon and does not get too close to Earth when returning to the Earth region, then it will permanently exist in space and permanently send scientific information. In another day or two, its duration of existence can be determined based on its condition when returning to the Earth region.

Kukarkin said that the orbit of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket is quite complex. After it orbits the moon for the first time and returns to the Earth region, it will not orbit the moon every time on its subsequent orbits, but it will continue to return to the Earth region like an Earth satellite. The long axis of the orbit reaches 400,000 kilometers, forming a "cosmic ring" in space. This situation is very convenient for studying cosmic space.

The scope of this automatic interplanetary station's investigation of cosmic space is very broad. It will orbit the sun once a year along with the Earth, so the vast range of cosmic space around the Earth can be investigated.

This interplanetary station has powerful solar batteries, ensuring that there will always be a power supply for the needs of the various instruments it carries. Every thirteen years, in mid-November, the Earth will pass through a meteor cloud belt on its orbit, where meteor particles are as dense as rain. This situation occurred in November of 1933 and 1946. It will happen again this November. The Soviet automatic interplanetary station will pass through the meteor cloud at that time, and it will definitely collect extremely valuable scientific materials.

Kukarkin continued, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station is controlled from the ground. The ground sends signals, and the interplanetary station automatically sends back scientific data on time. Kukarkin also said that future interstellar scientific stations or spacecraft can be of various types. For example, there are those carrying living organisms, whose purpose is to study the reactions of living organisms in cosmic space; there are those launched to other planetary regions; there are those carrying instruments that land safely on the moon; there are those capable of returning to Earth, and so on.

Kukarkin said, "Launching a scientific station carrying instruments that lands safely on the moon and then works is a matter of the near future. It will not be in the near future to have a scientific station return to Earth. But you and I will obviously be able to see it happen. The scientific station can not only land on this side of the moon, but also on the other side that does not face the Earth.

Kukarkin said that for humans to go to the moon, three preconditions are required. First, to be able to land safely on the moon; second, to be able to take off from the moon; and third, to be able to land safely on Earth. Once these three conditions are met, humans can travel to the universe. Because solar radiation is very strong on the moon, the future manned scientific station on the moon will probably be located several meters below the lunar surface, like an underground streetcar line on Earth. The scientific station will have a protective layer on top, and normal air pressure and temperature can be created under the protective layer to ensure normal living conditions for people there. Only the gravity on the moon is five-sixths less than the gravity on Earth, and there is no way to change this.

    苏联行星际站在地面指挥下频频传讯
    考察范围非常广泛将会收集到极有价值的科学资料
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联第三个宇宙火箭正在继续向月球飞行。10月5日莫斯科时间二十时，火箭离地球二十八万四千公里，位置在大西洋地区上空，座标是南纬二十度四十分，西经二十一度三十分。
    苏联第三个宇宙火箭继续准确地沿着预定的轨道运行。
    初步整理10月4日第二次测量所得到的遥测资料的结果确定，安装在自动行星际站上的调节温度的系统、能源和科学考察仪器工作正常。
    10月5日莫斯科时间十五时到十七时，自动行星际站按照地面的指挥播送了这次遥控测量的资料，资料已经由地面站录音。
    自动行星际站下一次向地球播送科学测量资料的时间是10月6日莫斯科时间十七时到十九时。
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　本社记者李楠报道：为了了解苏联4日发射的第三个宇宙火箭的意义，记者访问了苏联著名科学家、国际天文学协会副主席库卡尔金。他说，苏联第一个宇宙火箭从月球附近经过后就停止发回科学情报。苏联第二个宇宙火箭在宇宙空间存在的时间很短，它到达月球后也停止发送科学情报。这两个宇宙火箭发回科学情报的时间都只有一昼夜半。苏联第三个宇宙火箭就消除了这个缺陷。自动行星际站只要存在一天，就会发回一天科学情报。如果它绕过月球，在返回地球区时不太接近地球，那么它就会永久在宇宙空间存在下去。就会永久有科学情报发来。再过一两天，根据它返回地球区时的状况就可以判定它存在的时间了。
    库卡尔金说，苏联第三个宇宙火箭的轨道是相当复杂的。它第一圈绕过月球回到地球区域后，在以后运行的轨道上，不会每次绕过月球，但仍会继续不断回到地球区域来，像一个地球卫星一样。轨道的长轴达四十万公里，在宇宙空间形成一个“宇宙环”。这种情况对于研究宇宙空间非常方便。
    这个自动行星际站考察宇宙空间的范围非常广泛。它将随着地球每年绕太阳一圈，因此地球在宇宙空间的广大范围都可以考察到。
    这个行星际站有强大的太阳能电池，保证永远有能源供应它所载各种仪器的需要。每隔十三年的十一月中旬，地球在运行的轨道上就会通过流星云带，那里流星微粒密集如雨。1933和1946年11月都曾发生过这种情况。今年11月这种情况又将发生。苏联自动行星际站到那时将会通过流星云，那时一定会搜集到极有价值的科学材料。
    库卡尔金接着说，苏联自动行星际站是从地面上控制的。地面上发出讯号，行星际站就按时自动发回科学资料。库卡尔金还说，未来的星际科学站或宇宙飞船可以有各种各样的类型。例如有载生物的，它的目的是研究生物在宇宙空间中的反应；有发射到其他行星区域去的；有带着仪器在月球上平安着陆的；有能够返回地面上来的等等。
    库卡尔金说：“发射带着仪器在月球上平安着陆，然后工作的科学站是最近将来的事。要使科学站返回地面上来还不会是最近将来的事。但我和你显然都能够看到它实现。科学站不仅可在月球的这一面着陆，也可以在不面对地球的另一面着陆。
    库卡尔金说，人类要到月球上去，还需要有三个先决条件。第一，要能在月球上平安降落；第二，要能从月球上起飞；第三，要能够在地球上平安降落。这三个条件具备后，人类就可以到宇宙中去旅行了。由于月球上太阳射线很厉害，未来的月球上有人的科学站大概要设立在月球表面若干米以下，像地球上的地下电车道那样。科学站上面有防护层，防护层下面可以创造正常的气压和气温，以保证人们在那里的正常生活条件。只是月球上的吸引力要比地球上的吸引力小六分之五，这点还没有办法改变。
