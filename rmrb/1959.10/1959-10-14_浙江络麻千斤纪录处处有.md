　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou -- Zhejiang's ramie-producing areas have fully begun harvesting and stripping ramie. Judging from the harvest situation in major ramie-producing areas such as Xiaoshan, Haining, Shangyu, and the suburbs of Hangzhou, this year's ramie has generally achieved a bumper harvest. Records of one thousand jin per mu are common everywhere. In Xiaoshan County, more than 4,000 mu of ramie fields have achieved yields of one thousand jin per mu. The 7.5 mu experimental plot jointly cultivated by the branch secretary and the team leader of the Longhu Brigade in the Gualli Commune achieved an average yield of 1,766.7 jin per mu. The Minfeng Production Team of the Jiubao Commune in Hangzhou City achieved 1,175 jin of dry ramie per mu on 37 mu of thousand-jin ramie fields.
　　This year's unprecedented bumper harvest of ramie fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. In the Shuguang and Xingfu Brigades of the Yipeng Commune in Xiaoshan County, there were 2,686 mu of interspersed ramie fields and ramie fields far from the village, including 596 mu located more than 20 li away, making cultivation and management extremely inconvenient. The ramie yield had historically been low. After communization, the land was adjusted, unfavorable cultivation conditions were changed, and cultivation management was strengthened, resulting in a significant increase in yield this year.
　　Currently, while harvesting and stripping ramie, the broad masses of commune members in the ramie-producing areas are also formulating winter planting plans, preparing to strive for an even greater harvest next year.

　　浙江络麻千斤纪录处处有
    据新华社杭州讯　浙江麻区已经全面开始收剥络麻。从萧山、海宁、上虞和杭州市郊等主要产麻地区的收获情况来看，今年络麻普告丰收。亩产千斤的纪录到处都有。萧山县有四千多亩麻田亩产千斤，瓜沥公社龙虎大队总支书记和大队长合种的七亩半试验地，平均亩产高达一千七百六十六斤七两；杭州市九堡公社民丰生产队三十七亩千斤麻田，亩产干麻一千一百七十五斤。
    今年络麻获得空前大丰收，充分显示了人民公社的无比优越性。萧山县义蓬公社曙光、幸福两个大队有二千六百八十六亩插花麻地和离村远的麻地，其中有五百九十六亩远在二十里路以外，耕作、管理极不方便，历年络麻产量都不高。公社化后调整了土地，改变了不利的耕作条件，加强了培育管理，今年产量显著提高。
    目前，麻区广大社员在收剥络麻的同时，制订了冬种规划，准备争取明年更大丰收。
