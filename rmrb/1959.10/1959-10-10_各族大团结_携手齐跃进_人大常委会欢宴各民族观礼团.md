Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held a grand banquet in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome all members of the nationalities visiting delegations and youth study groups who came to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The banquet was presided over by Lin Boqu and Panchen Erdeni, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. More than a thousand representatives from more than 50 ethnic groups gathered happily.

Vice Chairman Lin Boqu first expressed warm welcome and congratulations to the representatives of all ethnic groups on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at the banquet.

He said: The people of all ethnic groups in our country are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled joy, celebrating the great victory of our country over the past ten years. In just ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, the ethnic minorities of our country have basically completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation, and have achieved great achievements in socialist construction. In particular, in 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the people of all ethnic groups in our country achieved an all-round Great Leap Forward on all fronts of socialist construction, and basically realized the people's commune system in rural areas, enabling all ethnic groups to enter a great historical period of rapid development.

Lin Boqu pointed out: Only our socialist country can completely solve the nationalities issue. According to the provisions of the Constitution, regional autonomy is implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and the equal rights of all ethnic minorities living in scattered and mixed communities are also fully guaranteed. In the National People's Congress, the highest organ of state power, ethnic minorities occupy an appropriate number of representatives, and all ethnic groups, in the big family of the motherland, participate in the management and decision-making of state affairs with equal status and as masters of the country. This fundamentally changed the political disempowerment, discrimination, and oppression suffered by ethnic minorities in our country before liberation. With the continuous development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the realization of rural people's communes, the socialist relations between ethnic groups in our country, characterized by great unity, great collaboration, common labor, and common development, have greatly developed. On the basis of socialism, the unity of all ethnic groups and the unification of the motherland have become more consolidated.

Lin Boqu said: Imperialism and all reactionaries are extremely hostile to the unity of our country and the unity of our nationalities. They always try their best to provoke the relations between the nationalities of our country, and vainly attempt to achieve their evil goals of opposing socialism and re-enslaving the people of all nationalities in our country. All their conspiracies and sabotage are in vain. The rapid suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet in March this year under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries is the best proof. We are pleased to see that the Tibetan people, after quelling the rebellion, are launching a vigorous democratic reform movement to get rid of the reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system. We congratulate the great victory of the Tibetan people.

Lin Boqu finally said: Let us, the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work together with one heart and one mind, oppose rightism, boost morale, hold high the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, to realize this year's national economic plan, to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year, and strive in a not-too-long period of time to build our country into a great socialist country with a highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture!

Vice Chairman Panchen Erdeni raised his glass at the banquet to toast: Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the savior of all ethnic groups! Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups, as solid as a rock! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups! At this time, representatives of all ethnic groups also stood up to toast for the unity, unification, prosperity, and strength of the family of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and for Chairman Mao's health.

Meihemaiti Simayi, Deputy Head of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Visiting Delegation, spoke on behalf of the representatives of all ethnic groups. He excitedly recounted the brilliant achievements of our country's nationalities work over the past ten years, and then stated: In the future, all ethnic groups will surely unite more closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the red flag of the General Line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, and always follow the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao to forge ahead bravely. He said that we must constantly consolidate the unification of the motherland, constantly consolidate and develop the great unity of all ethnic groups with the Han nationality as the center, actively strive for the support and assistance of the Han elder brother, continue to oppose and overcome bourgeois nationalism, thoroughly overcome local nationalism among our ethnic minorities, and resolutely fight against all phenomena that endanger the unification of the motherland and the unity of nationalities. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose rightism, boost morale, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic minorities in building socialism, launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and bravely struggle for the continued Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

Wei Guoqing, Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, also attended the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were: some members of the Standing Committee of the NPC in Beijing, Bao Erhan and Xie Fumin, Deputy Chairmen of the NPC Nationalities Committee, and Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China.

Before the banquet, Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu and Panchen Erdeni met with the heads and deputy heads of the nationalities visiting delegations and youth study groups, as well as some officials from Tibet.

    各族大团结　携手齐跃进
    人大常委会欢宴各民族观礼团
    新华社9日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天晚上在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大酒会，欢宴来京参加建国十周年庆祝大典的各民族观礼团、青年学习团全体人员。
    酒会由全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠、班禅额尔德尼主持。包括五十多个民族的一千多名代表喜气洋洋，欢聚一堂。
    林伯渠副委员长首先在宴会上代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会，向各民族的代表表示热烈的欢迎和祝贺。
    他说：我国各民族人民以无比欢欣的心情庆祝建国十周年，庆祝我国十年来的伟大胜利。在短短的十年内，我国各少数民族在中国共产党和各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，基本完成了民主改革和社会主义改造，并且取得了社会主义建设的巨大成就。特别是1958年我国各族人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在社会主义建设各个战线上取得了全面大跃进，并且在农村基本实现了人民公社化，使各民族进入了一个飞跃发展的伟大历史时期。
    林伯渠指出：只有我们社会主义国家，才能够彻底解决民族问题。根据宪法的规定，我国聚居的少数民族实行了区域自治，一切散居和杂居的少数民族的平等权利也得到了充分的保障。在国家最高权力机关——全国人民代表大会中，少数民族占有适当名额的代表，各民族在祖国大家庭内，都以平等的地位和国家主人翁的姿态，参加了国家事务的管理和决定。这就从根本上改变了我国少数民族解放前在政治上无权的地位和受歧视、受压迫的痛苦境遇。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的不断发展，特别是社会主义建设全面大跃进和农村人民公社化的实现，我国各族人民大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同发展的社会主义民族关系有了很大的发展。在社会主义的基础上，各民族的团结和祖国的统一更加巩固了。
    林伯渠说：帝国主义和一切反动派，是极端仇视我国的统一和民族的团结。他们总是千方百计地挑拨我国的民族关系，妄想达到他们反对社会主义和重新奴役我国各民族人民的罪恶目的。他们的一切阴谋破坏都是枉费心机的。今年3月西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义和外国反动派策动下所发动的反革命叛乱被迅速平息，就是一个最好的证明。我们高兴地看到，西藏人民在平息叛乱后，正在为摆脱反动的、黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制度，开展了轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动。我们祝贺西藏人民的伟大胜利。
    林伯渠最后说：让我们各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同心同德，团结一致，反右倾，鼓干劲，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，为实现今年的国民经济计划，为提前三年即在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，为争取在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而奋勇前进！
    班禅额尔德尼副委员长在酒会上举杯祝颂：各民族的救星中国共产党万岁！各民族坚如磐石的伟大团结万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！各民族伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！这时，各民族代表也起立为祖国各民族大家庭的团结、统一、繁荣、昌盛，为毛主席的健康而干杯。
    新疆维吾尔自治区观礼团副团长梅合买提·司马益代表各民族代表讲话。他兴奋地讲述了十年来我国民族工作的辉煌成就，然后表示：今后各民族一定更加亲密地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，高举总路线的红旗，坚持大跃进和人民公社，永远遵循着党和毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。他说，我们必须不断地巩固祖国的统一，不断地巩固和发展以汉族为中心的各民族大团结，积极争取汉族老大哥的支援和帮助，继续反对和克服资产阶级民族主义，在我们少数民族中要彻底克服地方民族主义，同一切危害祖国统一和民族团结的现象作坚决的斗争。我们必须坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，反右倾，鼓干劲，充分发挥各少数民族人民建设社会主义的积极性，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为实现社会主义建设的继续大跃进而英勇奋斗。
    广西僮族自治区主席韦国清，西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美都出席了宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的有：人大常务委员会部分在京委员，人大民族委员会副主任委员包尔汉、谢扶民，和中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春、杨静仁、谢鹤筹等。
    宴会前，林伯渠、班禅额尔德尼副委员长曾接见了各民族观礼团和青年学习团的正副团长以及西藏的部分官员。
