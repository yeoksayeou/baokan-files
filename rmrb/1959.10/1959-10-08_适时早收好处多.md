Timely Early Harvest Has Many Benefits
Key

The sweet potato harvest season is fast approaching. Based on past experience, appropriately advancing the sweet potato harvest has many benefits.

First, early harvesting facilitates the allocation of labor and reduces losses during harvesting. The sweet potato harvest season coincides with the harvest of other grains, oilseeds, and cash crops. Since sweet potatoes have a high yield per unit area, harvesting requires a large amount of labor. Therefore, sweet potato harvesting should not be crammed together with the harvest of other crops. Appropriately advancing the sweet potato harvest can reduce the busyness of the autumn harvest, allowing for more meticulous harvesting. Generally, seed crops have certain maturity standards, and seeds should be harvested only when they reach a certain level of maturity. However, sweet potato tubers do not have a fixed maturity standard, so appropriately advancing the harvest has little impact on yield.

Second, appropriate early harvesting is conducive to processing and utilization. The main component of sweet potatoes is starch. Harvesting earlier can prevent low temperatures from promoting starch saccharification, reducing the extraction rate and flour yield during processing and utilization. According to experiments by the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau, sweet potatoes harvested on October 3rd yielded 2,955 jin per mu, while those harvested on November 3rd yielded 4,370 jin per mu, but the actual starch content decreased (the earlier harvest was 24.64%, the later harvest was 14.63%). Therefore, while late harvesting may increase the yield per mu, appropriate early harvesting is beneficial for processing and utilization. At the same time, the temperature is still high and the sunlight is strong when harvesting early, which is very beneficial for drying.

Third, appropriate early harvesting allows for the full utilization of sweet potato vines (sweet potato seedlings). Sweet potato vines are a nutritious feed, comparable to clover in pastures. If mixed with corn stalks for silage, the feeding value is even higher than that of ordinary fodder. Vines that have not been exposed to frost are not only of better quality, but also have a higher yield per unit area. According to the experience of some regions, harvesting in early October can yield more than 1,900 jin of sweet potato seedlings per mu, while harvesting in early November yields only more than 690 jin. It can be seen that early harvesting can yield a lot of good feed.

Fourth, early sweet potato harvesting can free up land in time to expand the area for replanting, and provide sufficient time for deep plowing and careful cultivation and other necessary measures, creating conditions for increasing grain production in the coming year.

In addition, sweet potatoes for long-term storage and seed retention should also be harvested early to facilitate safe storage. Because sweet potatoes are thermophilic crops, prolonged exposure to low temperatures (below 9 degrees Celsius) can cause varying degrees of cold damage. Slight damage reduces vitality and affects germination, while severe damage causes rotting after entering the cellar.

    适时早收好处多
    关键
    甘薯的收获季节快要到来了。根据历年经验，甘薯适当提前早收，好处很多。
    早收，首先是有利调配劳动力，减少收获中的损失。在甘薯收获时期，也正是其他粮食、油料、经济作物的收获时期，而薯类单位面积产量很高，在收获时需要很大的劳动力，因此收薯不宜和其他作物的收获挤在一起。适当提前早收甘薯，就能减少秋收时农活的繁忙程度，使收获工作做得更细致。一般种子作物都有一定的成熟标准，种子达到一定成熟度才宜收割；而甘薯的块根没有一定的成熟标准，因此适当提前收获对产量影响不大。
    其次，适当早收有利于加工利用。甘薯主要成分是淀粉，收获的较早，可避免因低温促进淀粉的糖化，降低加工利用的出干率和出粉率。根据北京市粮食局的试验，10月3日收获的亩产二千九百五十五市斤，11月3日收获的亩产虽达到四千三百七十市斤，但淀粉实际含量反而降低了（先收的是24.64％，后收的是14.63％）。因此晚收亩产量虽有所增加，但在加工利用上适当早收是有利的。同时早收气温尚高，阳光较强，对晒干也很有利。
    第三，适当早收对甘薯的地上茎蔓（薯秧）能充分的利用。薯蔓是营养丰富的饲料，它和牧草中的三叶草相比，不分上下；若与玉米秆等混合青贮，饲用价值比一般饲草还高。没有受霜冻的茎蔓不但性质好，而且单位产量高。据一些地区的经验，10月初收获的每亩可收薯秧一千九百多斤，11月初收获的只有六百九十多斤了。可见，早收可以多得不少良好的饲料。
    第四，甘薯早收可以及时腾出田地，扩大复种面积；并有充分的时间进行深耕细作等必要措施，为来年增产更多的粮食创造条件。
    此外，长期贮藏和留种的甘薯，也要适时早收，才有利安全贮藏。因为甘薯是喜温作物，经受较长时间低温（摄氏九度以下），便会发生不同程度的冷害。受害轻的降低生活力，影响发芽；受害重的入窖后即腐烂。
