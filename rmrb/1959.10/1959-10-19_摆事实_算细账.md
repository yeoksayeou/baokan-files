Editor's Note:

　　Are the people's communes good or not? Are they being run well, or are they a mess? In the process of carrying out the socialist education movement, the Zhenda Brigade of the Guizhou Commune improved the awareness of the broad masses of commune members by calculating accounts person by person and team by team. The brigade's calculations proved that since communization, crop yields have increased significantly, and sideline production such as pig and poultry raising has also grown many times over; in terms of living standards, the average monthly ration was more than 25 jin before communization, but increased by 9% after communization; last year, the whole brigade made more than 3,600 new clothes, an increase of 38% over the previous year; ... . Life is the best testimony. By calculating accounts and presenting vivid facts, who would dare to lie in the face of it!
    Calculating accounts is a good method for the masses to conduct self-education. Through calculating accounts, some people with vague understanding can distinguish between right and wrong; it can also force those who attempt to oppose the people's communes to bow their heads and admit their guilt in the face of the facts, and isolate them among the masses; even more, it can allow the broad masses of basic people who resolutely support the people's communes to hold their heads high, straighten their backs, muster their energy, and usher in a new upsurge of winter production.

　　摆事实　算细账
    人民公社究竟好不好？是办好了，还是办糟了？桂洲公社振德大队在开展社会主义教育运动中，通过人人算账、队队算账的办法，使广大社员提高了觉悟。这个大队算账的结果证明：公社化一年来，农作物显著增产了，生猪、家禽等副业生产也成倍增长；在生活方面，公社化以前八个月平均每月口粮二十五斤多，公社化以后增加了9％；去年全大队共做新衣三千六百多件，比前年增加38％；……。生活是最好的见证。通过算账，摆出了活生生的事实，谁还敢当面撒谎呢！
    算账是群众进行自我教育的一个好方法。通过算账，能使有些认识模糊的人分清了大是大非；也能使那些企图反对人民公社的人在事实面前不得不低头认罪，并且在群众中孤立起来；更能使坚决拥护人民公社的广大基本群众扬眉吐气，挺起腰板，鼓足干劲，掀起冬季生产新高潮。
