    Regarding Research on Foreign Literature
    The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published a series of articles from August 26th for three consecutive days, titled "Foreign Literature Research and Japanese Literature."
    The articles stated: "Japan still ranks among the top in importing foreign literature. Almost all foreign literature trends can be found in Japan, and Japan has practically become a world literature dictionary. Especially in Japan today, which lacks a literary mainstream, the demand for new foreign literature is even more urgent." The articles believe that "to study a country's literature, one needs to analyze and understand its literary works from the perspective of the people of that country." Although Japan has a strong academic atmosphere for the study of foreign literature, this basic problem has not yet been resolved.
    The articles also introduced two different views of Japanese translators regarding translated works.
    The articles believe that when introducing foreign works, attention is only paid to the ideological content, and the genre of the work is not adequately considered. This makes it impossible to produce true literature; this is why modern Japanese literature is considered abnormal, namely, that the relationship between ideological content and genre is not considered.

    关于外国文学的研究
    日本“朝日新闻”自8月26日起连续三天，以“外国文学研究与日本文学”为题发表文章。
    文章说：“日本在输入外国文学方面仍名列前茅。外国文学倾向日本几乎全部都有，日本简直成了世界文学辞典。特别在日本缺少一种文学主流的今天，对外国新文学的要求就更为迫切。”文章认为，“研究一个国家的文学，需从这一国家的人民的角度来分析和理解它的文学作品”。而日本对于外国文学的研究风气虽盛，至今却仍未解决这一基本问题。
    文章还介绍了日本翻译家对翻译作品的两种不同看法。
    文章认为，由于介绍外国作品时，只注重思想内容，而对作品的体裁却不太考虑，这样就不可能产生真正的文学；这就是日本近代文学之所以被认为不正常，即不考虑思想内容和体裁的关系的原因。
