　　Learning from Lu Xun's Revolutionary Steadfastness
　　Mei Yuan
　　Today is the 23rd anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. The fighting life of this great writer, great thinker, and great revolutionary is worthy of our eternal remembrance and study. Lu Xun's progress from a revolutionary democrat to a communist has been extensively introduced, but I think bringing it up again today will be beneficial for those right-leaning opportunists and all those with right-leaning thoughts and emotions.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong gave Mr. Lu Xun extremely high praise: a great writer, a great thinker, and a great revolutionary. This is not accidental. Lu Xun went through a long road before finally becoming a communist. He was originally from a gentry-official family, and due to seeing the decay of feudal society, he relentlessly exposed and criticized all the maladies of feudal society. The earlier Lu Xun was a rebellious son of feudal patriarchal society and a disloyal subject of the gentry class. However, before accepting Marxism, although Lu Xun was aware of the corruption of the old society and hoped for the rise of a new society, he did not know what this "new" should be. At the time, he himself felt like he was "standing at a crossroads." He once quoted a line from "Li Sao" as the title for "Wandering": "The road ahead is long and winding, I will search up and down." This precisely showed his distress and hesitation, yet also his determination to pursue the truth. After a considerable period of searching up and down, and receiving "lessons from facts" in the struggle, Lu Xun finally accepted Marxism, progressing from a rebellious son and disloyal subject of the gentry class to a true friend and fighter of the proletariat and the working masses. The greatness of Lu Xun as a revolutionary lies not only in his resolute struggle against the enemy, but more importantly, in his ability to advance with the progress of the revolution. If Lu Xun had not been able to become a Marxist, and had not been able to cross the boundaries of evolutionism and revolutionary democracy, then he would obviously not have surpassed those patriots of his time and become a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's early struggle against the enemy was certainly very resolute, but if Lu Xun had not been able to become a Marxist, then he would not have had the later stage of combat that was more clearly directed and more mature, and become a national hero charging against the enemy.

　　Lu Xun was able to advance with the progress of the revolution because he dared to "face life directly" and was good at making profound and thorough observations and analyses of historical and current social phenomena; at the same time, in the struggle to dissect and transform the objective world, he also frequently and earnestly dissected himself—transforming his own subjective world. Before mastering the Marxist worldview, how could Lu Xun not have had non-proletarian thoughts and feelings? He later criticized his previous "bias towards believing only in evolution," and also talked about the shortcomings in his previous thoughts: "I often talk about my own affairs, how I am 'bumping into walls,' how I am acting like a snail, as if all the world's troubles are concentrated on myself, as if I am suffering for the masses; it is also precisely the bad temper of the middle-class intellectuals." Lu Xun's early works, despite fiercely attacking all the maladies of feudal society, also had a dark side, underestimating and doubting the role of the people in history and the revolutionary power of the masses. He said: "Now people often scold parliamentarians, saying they take bribes, have no integrity, are sycophantic, and selfish, but aren't the majority of the people just like this? These kinds of parliamentarians are, in fact, representatives of the people." He believed that transforming society "can only start with the intellectual class, and the masses can be discussed later." However, after accepting Marxism, Lu Xun said: "Although the common people do not read poetry and books, do not understand historical methods, do not know how to find flaws in jade or find reason in dung, they can see the general picture, distinguish between black and white, and tell right from wrong, often reaching places that high-minded and enlightened scholar-officials cannot reach." "Only the emerging proletarians have a future." The Marxist Lu Xun saw the wisdom, strength, and great role of the people in history, and no longer regarded the "intellectual class" as so superior. Transforming the objective world while also transforming one's own subjective world is the most fundamental reason why Lu Xun was able to become a proletarian fighter and even a great revolutionary.

　　With the rise of every revolutionary force, the fighters generally have only one meaning in common, which is to resist the status quo, but their ultimate goals are extremely different. ... Because of the different ultimate goals, in the course of advancement, people are constantly leaving the ranks, deserting, becoming decadent, and betraying.

　　Although Lu Xun's words were spoken twenty-nine years ago, they still shine with the light of truth today. Today's right-leaning opportunists were also participants in the national democratic revolution—in the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, under the oppression of the three major enemies, the vast majority of the people, including the bourgeoisie, felt suffocating pain. Why couldn't children from non-proletarian backgrounds participate in the revolution? At the time, their resistance to the status quo and the proletariat's program of struggle were roughly the same; but now, the national democratic revolution has been completed, and the previous revolutionary targets have been overthrown. Thus, in the course of the revolution's in-depth development, they have left the ranks, deserted, become decadent, and even betrayed; in the final analysis, it is because their ultimate goals are different from ours.

　　It is not surprising that at the beginning of participating in the revolution, there was no clear and concrete communist belief and Marxist worldview; when Lu Xun participated in the Restoration Society and during the May Fourth Movement, did he have any Marxist ideas? Compared with some revolutionaries of his time, Lu Xun did not accept Marxism very early. But the reason why Lu Xun was able to become a resolute and thorough revolutionary, and the reason why some people left the ranks, deserted, and betrayed in the course of the revolution, becoming rightists or right-leaning opportunists, lies in the fact that the former advanced with the progress of the revolution, abandoning all inherited burdens, gradually and finally completely sharing life with the proletariat; while the latter always seemed to be with the proletariat but were actually estranged, with the same old things still in their bones, only exposed today.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong compared Lu Xun to a large tree standing independently amidst the darkness and violent invasion, saying that he saw the political direction clearly and fought bravely towards a goal, never surrendering or compromising midway. Lu Xun was the most resolute revolutionary.

　　Today, our era is different from Lu Xun's. There are no storms and heavy rains, but sunshine everywhere, and the harsh and bloody class struggle is basically gone. However, socialist construction has not yet been completed, and the bourgeoisie and the unreformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists still exist. Although the general trend of class struggle has eased, it has not been extinguished. Moreover, the struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward in society will always exist. Therefore, even today, or tomorrow, Lu Xun's revolutionary steadfastness, which is constantly advancing, resolute and thorough, and as firmly established as a large tree, is still worth learning for each of us. Learn from him and move forward forever! (Attached image)

　　学习鲁迅的革命坚定性
　　梅原
    今天是鲁迅先生逝世二十三周年纪念日。这位伟大的文学家，伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家的战斗的一生，是值得我们永远怀念和学习的。鲁迅由一个革命民主主义者进到共产主义者，人们对这已经介绍得很多，但我想现在再把它提出来，对于今天的那些右倾机会主义分子，和一切有着右倾思想和右倾情绪的人，是会有好处的。
    毛泽东同志给了鲁迅先生极其崇高的评价：伟大的文学家、伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家，这不是偶然的。鲁迅最后成为共产主义者，曾经经历了漫长的道路。他原是士大夫阶级的子弟，由于看到封建社会的腐朽，无情地揭露和抨击了封建社会的一切病态。先前的鲁迅，是封建宗法社会的逆子，绅士阶级的贰臣。然而鲁迅在接受马克思主义之前，虽然觉到了旧社会的腐败，希望着新的社会的起来，但他并不知道这“新的”该是什么，当时他自己也感到正“站在十字路口”上。他曾引用“离骚”中的诗句作为“仿徨”的卷首题词：“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。”这正显现他的苦闷和仿徨，然而又要坚决追求真理的心境。经过一个相当时期的上下求索，在战斗中得到“事实的教训”，鲁迅终于接受了马克思主义，从绅士阶级的逆子贰臣进到无产阶级和劳动群众的真正的友人和战士了。革命家的鲁迅之所以伟大，不仅在于他向敌人的斗争是坚决的，而且更重要的，在于他能随着革命的前进而前进。如果鲁迅没有能成为一个马克思主义者，不能跨越过进化论和革命民主主义的范畴，那他就显然不会超过和他同时代的那些爱国者，而成为一个伟大的革命家。鲁迅早期向敌人的战斗固然是十分坚决的，但如果鲁迅没有能成为一个马克思主义者，那他就不会有后期的那种方向更为明确、战斗更趋成熟的战斗，而成为向敌人冲锋陷阵的民族英雄了。
    鲁迅之所以能随着革命的前进而前进，因为他敢于“直面人生”，善于对历史和当前的社会现象作深刻透彻的观察和分析；同时在解剖、改造客观世界的斗争中，也经常认真地解剖自己——改造自己的主观世界。掌握马克思主义世界观之前的鲁迅，何尝没有非无产阶级的思想感情呢？他后来曾批判自己先前
  “只信进化论的偏颇”，而且谈到自己先前思想中的缺点：“我时时说些自己的事情，怎样地在‘碰壁’，怎样地在做蜗牛，好像全世的苦恼，萃于一身，在替大众受罪似的；也正是中产的知识阶级分子的坏脾气。”鲁迅早期的作品，尽管猛烈地抨击了封建社会的一切病态，但也有阴暗的一面，对历史上人民的作用、群众的革命力量，估计不足而且怀疑。他说：“现在常有人骂议员，说他们收贿，无特操，趋炎附势，自私自利，但大多数的国民，岂非正是如此的吗？这类的议员，其实确是国民的代表。”他认为改造社会“只好从知识阶级一面先行设法，民众俟将来再谈。”然而鲁迅在接受马克思主义后，便说：“老百姓虽然不读诗书，不明史法，不解在瑜中求瑕、屎里觅道。但能从大概上看，明黑白，辨是非，往往有决非清高通达的士大夫所可几及之处的。”“唯新兴的无产者才有将来。”马克思主义者的鲁迅，看到了人民群众的智慧、力量和在历史上的伟大作用，再也不把“知识阶级”看得那样高超了。改造客观世界，同时又改造自己的主观世界，这是鲁迅所以能成为无产阶级战士以至伟大的革命家的最根本的原因。
    每一革命部队的突起，战士大抵不过是反抗现状这一种意思，大略相同，终极目的是极为歧异的。……因为终极目的的不同，在行进时，也时时有人退伍，有人落荒，有人颓唐，有人叛变。
    鲁迅的话虽然是在二十九年前说的，但今天仍旧闪耀着它的真理的光芒。今天的右倾机会主义者，先前也曾是民族民主革命的参加者，——在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，在三大敌人的压迫下，绝大多数人民，包括资产阶级在内，都感觉着窒息的痛苦，非无产阶级出身的子弟们，何尝不可以参加革命？他们当时反抗现状，和无产阶级当时的战斗纲领，是大略相同的；然而现在，民族民主革命完成了，先前的革命对象打倒了，于是他们在革命深入发展的行进中，便退伍、落荒、颓唐，甚至叛变了；归根究底，因为他们的终极目的是和我们不同的。
    参加革命之初，没有明确具体的共产主义信仰和马克思主义世界观，这并不奇怪的；鲁迅在参加光复会时，以及五四运动开展时期，难道有什么马克思主义的思想了吗？在和同时代的某些革命者比较，鲁迅接受马克思主义，并不算很早的。但鲁迅之所以能成为一个坚决的彻底的革命家，而有些人之所以在革命行进中退伍、落荒、叛变，沦为右派分子或右倾机会主义者，就在于前者是随着革命的前进而前进，抛弃了一切因袭的重负，逐步以至最后完全地和无产阶级共同着生命的；而后者则是始终和无产阶级貌合神离，内骨子依旧是那些旧的东西，只在今天暴露出来了而已。
    毛泽东同志曾把鲁迅比喻为在黑暗和暴力进袭中的独立支持的大树，说他看清了政治方向，就向着一个目标奋勇地斗争下去，决不中途投降妥协。鲁迅是最坚决的革命家。
    我们今天和鲁迅的时代不同了，没有狂风暴雨，而是阳光普照，严酷的流血的阶级斗争基本上没有了。但社会主义建设尚未完成，资产阶级和没有改造好的地主、富农、反革命、右派分子依然存在，阶级斗争的总趋势尽管缓和了，然而是并未熄灭的。而且，社会上新和旧、先进和落后的斗争，也会永远存在。所以，即使在今天，或者明天，鲁迅那种不断前进的，坚定的彻底的，像大树那样确立不移的革命坚定性，仍然值得我们每个人学习。学习他，永远前进！（附图片）
