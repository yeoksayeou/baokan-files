Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines are advancing victoriously during the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, achieving a good start in October. In the first five days of October, pig iron exceeded the plan by 0.7%, an increase of 9.6% compared to the same period last month; steel billets exceeded the plan by 6%; steel exceeded the plan by 4.7%; and metallurgical coke also overfulfilled the state plan.

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party committees of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, generally summarized the experiences in production and work in September, further examined and overcame right-leaning emotions, and extensively and deeply mobilized the masses to organize labor competitions for high output, high quality, and low cost. The workers stated one after another: They will excellently complete the production tasks, create a good start in October, and welcome the convening of the National Conference of Heroes. During the National Day holiday, leading cadres of various factories and mines personally went to the front line to participate in and lead production, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the workers. Yang Chunfu, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, and other responsible cadres of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, all personally went to the iron and steel production front line on October 1st to celebrate the festival with the workers. They expressed their appreciation to all the workers who persisted in production during the festival and encouraged them to decisively fight the fourth quarter, ensure a good start in October, and strive to overfulfill this year's iron and steel leap forward plan.

In the battle to ensure high production during the festival, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant all participated in performance competitions, breaking through production bottlenecks. From the 1st to the 5th, the entire plant overproduced pig iron by 2,427 tons compared to the plan, and successively set the plant's highest daily production record on the 3rd and 5th. The famous No. 9 blast furnace produced 2,345 tons of pig iron on the 3rd, with a utilization coefficient reaching 2.484. The workers on the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, who pioneered the experience of performance competitions, are even more motivated. Focusing on the key to production, they continued to carry out mass performance competitions with everyone performing at all times, and produced more than 200 tons of high-quality steel more than planned on October 3rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th: The two modern large blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel achieved a double leap forward in output and quality in the first five days of October. The pig iron produced by the two blast furnaces from the 1st to the 5th was more than 3,390 tons more than in the same period in September, and the quality of the pig iron was all qualified. The smelting time of the No. 1 large open-hearth furnace, which was put into production on September 30, has also gradually been shortened to more than eleven hours, and is gradually moving towards normal production.

During the grand festival celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company were all full of energy, fighting day and night, and attended full attendance to welcome the decisive fourth quarter. The Party secretaries and factory directors of the Ironmaking Plant and Steelmaking Plant stayed at the site day and night, taking turns on duty to solve key problems in production. Under the slogan of "Fighting for three days to offer a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," the ironmaking workers launched inter-team and inter-group competitions of the same type during the National Day, and workers inside and outside the furnace were conscientious in their operations, making the furnace run smoothly.

In order to make the newly participating No. 1 open-hearth furnace quickly move towards normal production, the Steelmaking Plant took many effective measures. They assigned the best workers to operate important equipment such as ingot cranes and loaders, and inspected them at any time to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. The workers also tried every means to shorten the steelmaking time. The furnace repair workers launched a high-temperature rapid furnace repair competition, shortening the furnace repair time from one and a half hours to forty minutes.

Now, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel are working harder and fighting heroically to complete the annual state plan ahead of schedule. The workers of the two blast furnaces have signed a competition contract with each other, determined to compete with each other in October to break through the daily pig iron production level of 4,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: The workers of factories such as Harbin Boiler Factory, Bearing Factory, and Songjiang Electric Motor Factory happily spent the National Day holiday and immediately plunged into the production upsurge of "Fighting the Fourth Quarter and Seizing the Red Flag for the Whole Year." They created excellent production results on the first day after the holiday, achieving a good start.

The workers of Harbin Bearing Factory fired the first shot after the holiday on the 4th when they went to work. The daytime output exceeded the plan by 40%, an increase of 58% compared to the same period in September, and exceeded the highest daily output in September by 12%. After the workers of the Harbin Boiler Factory achieved a red opening day, they ensured that the first ten days would be red, the whole month would be red, and the whole quarter would be red, in order to achieve a red year. They will complete 62.2% of the total task volume from January to September in the fourth quarter. The annual electric motor production task of Songjiang Electric Motor Factory is 410,000 kilowatts. In the past nine months, 360,000 kilowatts have been completed. In October, the workers proposed to ensure the completion of 60,000 kilowatts, an increase of 20,000 kilowatts compared to the average monthly output of the previous nine months, and strive to complete the annual electric motor production task in October.

In order to achieve a good start in October and overfulfill the annual plan, the workers of each factory earnestly carried out production preparations during the National Day holiday. More than 1,000 workers from Harbin Bearing Factory inspected equipment and did production preparation work during the holiday. 60% of the machine tools in the factory were inspected, and hundreds of measures to ensure the completion of the fourth quarter plan were implemented. The workers of Harbin Boiler Factory are determined to turn October, which has few working days, into the month with the highest output in the factory this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th: The workers on the industrial front in Taiyuan City achieved new production achievements at the beginning of October under the slogan of "A good start in October and a full house in all seasons." From the 2nd to the 3rd, the output of steel, iron, steel, and raw coal in the city rose sharply. Compared with the same period last month, steel increased by 19.13%, iron increased by 20.7%, steel increased by 5.81%, and raw coal increased by 30.66%.

Before the National Day, the workers of various factories and mines in Taiyuan City enthusiastically discussed the new production plan and put forward the slogan of a good start in October and completing the annual task ahead of schedule. At the beginning of October, many factory and mine workers launched opponent competitions between workshops, teams, groups, and individuals. Yao Qinglan's team of No. 2 furnace in the First Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company shortened the time for smelting a furnace of steel to two hours and thirty minutes, shortening it by one hour and twenty minutes compared to the plan, creating the latest record this year. Young blast furnace workers showed their skills, making the blast furnace utilization coefficient break through more than three tons. In the past three days, the output of each factory in the company has been rising day by day. In these three days, the company's daily steel output increased by 29.68% compared to the same period last month; iron increased by 19.77%; and steel increased by 20.79%.

In order to realize the fighting slogan of "High production during the festival and a good start in October," many party and government leading cadres of various units personally fought alongside the workers in front of the furnace and underground, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. The Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Director, and Deputy Director of Xishan Mining Bureau followed shifts and went down the well, working and directing production. On the 1st, the daily output of raw coal reached more than 17,000 tons, and the total output for the three days increased by 14.11% compared to the same period last month.
