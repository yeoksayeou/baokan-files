    The Victory of the People's Commune, The Bankruptcy of Right-Leaning Arguments
    Autumn Grain Harvests in Five Provinces North and South
    Hunan's 4 Million Mu of Late Rice Exceeds 500 Jin Per Mu, Greatly Surpassing Last Year
    Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanxi Continuously Report Good News While Harvesting, Thousand-Jin Fields Emerging Everywhere
    (Reported by this newspaper) The autumn crops in five provinces, both north and south, have achieved bumper harvests, once again declaring the victory of the people's communes and the bankruptcy of right-leaning arguments. In Hunan Province, by the 19th, more than 4 million mu of late rice had been harvested, with an average yield of 505 jin per mu. Thousands upon thousands of "thousand-jin mu" have emerged, exceeding the yields of early rice, catching up with middle rice, and shattering the theory that late rice has low yields. In Jiangxi, whether in mountainous, plain, or hilly areas, both single-season and double-season late rice have achieved bumper harvests. According to Tonggu, Guangfeng, and Nanchang counties, the minimum increase was 21% over last year, and the maximum increase was 70%. In Fujian and Zhejiang, many "thousand-jin fields" have emerged as soon as harvesting began. Shanxi's more than 9 million mu of millet also generally achieved bumper harvests. In the Hongguang People's Commune of Wuxiang, one management area had two experimental plots with a yield of 2,626.5 jin per mu, creating the highest single-yield record for millet in Shanxi.

    (This newspaper, Changsha, 23rd) Hunan Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of over 13 million mu of late rice. By the 19th, more than 4 million mu of late rice had been harvested throughout the province, with an average yield of 505 jin of dry grain per mu (previously averaging only 200-300 jin), greatly exceeding the bumper harvest of last year, surpassing this year's early rice, and catching up with middle rice.

    Liling County, a well-known high-yield rice area in the province, has harvested and threshed more than 150,000 mu, with an average yield of 745 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of more than 40% in yield per unit area compared to last year's late rice, and more than 30% higher than this year's early rice. The county has also produced 70 "thousand-jin" bumper harvest brigades and 567 "thousand-jin" bumper harvest production teams. Yiyang County, on the shores of Dongting Lake, overcame more than 110 days of drought this year and achieved a bumper harvest of double-season late rice. The more than 160,000 mu of late rice that has been harvested so far has yielded an average of more than 570 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of nearly 100% compared to last year's late rice. Anren County's more than 130,000 mu of late rice yielded an average of 550 jin per mu, with one-third of the fields yielding more than 800 jin per mu. In You County, the old revolutionary base area in eastern Hunan, the more than 280,000 mu of double-season late rice that has been harvested yielded an average of 660 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of more than 40% in yield per unit area compared to this year's early rice, and more than 80% higher than last year's late rice.

    The bumper harvest of double-season late rice once again proves the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. This year, Hunan Province experienced drought in the summer followed by drought in the autumn. Many areas had no thorough rain for seven or eighty consecutive days. People's communes in various places launched large-scale cooperation, turning out together, with up to 6 million people pumping water to irrigate the fields, and finally overcoming the drought. At the same time, this year, people's communes in various places also conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" before and after the harvest, thus achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest and shattering the "low-yield theory of late rice."

    Currently, the double-season late rice harvesting work in the province has formed a high tide. Every day, more than 3 million male and female commune members are fighting in the vast fields. From the shores of Dongting Lake to the foot of the Wuling Mountains, across thousands of miles, they are celebrating the harvest.

    (This newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd) The harvesting of single-season late rice in Jiangxi Province has basically ended, and the harvesting of double-season late rice is underway. Throughout the province, whether in high mountains, plains, or hilly areas, lakeshore lowlands, both single-season and double-season late rice have achieved bumper harvests.

    The more than 80,000 mu of single-season late rice in Tonggu County, where the mountains are high and the water is cold, has an average yield of 450 jin per mu, 32% higher than the yield per unit area of this year's early rice. The more than 20,000 mu of single-season late rice in Guangfeng County, distributed in thin mountain ridges, has an average yield of 550 jin per mu, 21% higher than last year. Nanchang County, located in the lakeside low-lying area, has more than 84,000 mu of single-season late rice this year, with an average yield of 510 jin per mu, 70% higher than last year. Pingxiang County suffered severe pest attacks this year, but the average yield of the county's 110,000 mu of single-season late rice still reached 600 jin. The Xiangdong Commune in this county has more than 1,000 mu of double-season late rice with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. The Xincun Brigade has 71 mu of double-season late rice, reaching more than 1,100 jin.

    Currently, the vast number of commune members throughout the province are racing against time, meticulously harvesting the fruitful results without wasting a single grain.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd) More than 13.2 million mu of middle rice and single-season and double-season late rice in Fujian Province have gradually ripened, and nearly 4 million mu of sweet potatoes will also be harvested soon. The autumn harvest season has arrived. In the past few days, more than 3.5 million mu of middle rice and single-season late rice have been harvested throughout the province.

    Good news of bumper harvests is coming from all directions. In Guangze County, in the Wuyi Mountains area, more than 127,000 mu of single-season late rice has been harvested, with an average yield increase of about 20% compared to last year. A high-yield experimental plot of 12.5 mu jointly cultivated by the Communist Youth League branch secretary and members of the Youxi Brigade of the Hangchuan Commune in this county has an average yield of 1,334 jin per mu. In Pucheng County, a remote mountainous area bordering Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, more than 70% of the more than 300,000 mu of single-season late rice has been harvested, and the yield per unit area is generally 20% to 30% higher than last year's bumper harvest. The more than 1,003 mu of single-season late rice harvested by the Jincheng Brigade of the Linjiang Commune in this county has an average yield of 817 jin per mu, an increase of 1.1 times compared to last year. The 121 mu of single-season late rice harvested by the Guxian Brigade of the Shibei Commune in Shaowu County has an average yield of 1,090 jin per mu, an increase of 1.86 times compared to last year. The Shangyong Commune in Dehua County, located in the Daiyun Mountains in central Fujian, has harvested nearly 10,000 mu of middle rice, with an average yield increase of nearly 30% compared to last year, and many "thousand-jin fields" have emerged.

    Currently, farmers in Fujian Province are fully engaged in the autumn harvest battle. Many communes and production brigades have established autumn harvest headquarters, organized specialized teams for harvesting, drying grain, and picking up grain, formulated agreements for meticulous harvesting and threshing, and launched large-scale competitions to ensure that they harvest one piece as soon as it ripens, achieving a bumper harvest and bringing every grain home.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 23rd) More than 20 million mu of autumn grain crops in Zhejiang Province are growing well. From the foot of Tianmu Mountain to the Zhoushan Islands, from Xianxia Ridge to the shores of Taihu Lake, waves of rice are rolling everywhere, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. Areas where harvesting has begun have already reported good news of 10,000-jin sweet potatoes per mu and 1,000-jin rice per mu. The average yield of the first harvested eight-plus mu of late rice in the Wangchun Commune of Ningbo City reached more than 1,100 jin per mu. The average yield of the first batch of 26 mu of sweet potatoes harvested by the Yunzhou Brigade of the Fengao Commune all broke the 10,000-jin mark. Many large-area high-yield late rice fields have also emerged in Longquan, Yongjia, Ruian, and other counties. Currently, the entire province is conducting in-depth ideological mobilization, exchanging harvesting experiences, formulating operating procedures, and preparing to welcome the autumn bumper harvest.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd) More than 9.6 million mu of millet in Shanxi Province have generally achieved a bumper harvest.

    The total output of autumn harvest crops in the Jinbei Special Zone increased by 15% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the increase in millet production in many counties and people's communes is particularly prominent. The Jin Southeast Special Zone, which has suffered continuous natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and hail, has seen a general bumper harvest of millet and other crops thanks to the people's communes' efforts to fight disasters and protect the autumn harvest. In Qin County, famous throughout the country for its "Qin Zhou Huang" millet, the 80,271 mu of millet has an average yield of 319 jin per mu, an increase of 38% compared to last year's bumper harvest.

    Many millet experimental fields have achieved high yields this year. In Licheng County, there are more than 20,000 mu of large-area high-yield millet fields. Calculated by area, the average yield per mu reached 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively. Nearly a hundred mu of millet experimental fields in Yuci City and Yanggao and Lingchuan counties happily made it onto the "thousand-jin list." In the Wutaiping Management Area of the Hongguang People's Commune of Wuxiang County, two mu of millet experimental fields had an average yield of 2,626.5 jin per mu, creating the highest single-yield record for millet in Shanxi Province this year.

    南北五省秋粮大丰收
    湖南四百万亩晚稻亩产五百斤大大超过去年
    江西福建浙江山西边收边传喜报处处涌现千斤田
    本报讯　南北五省秋季作物都获得了大丰收，再一次宣告人民公社的胜利，右倾论调的破产。湖南省到十九日止，已收割晚稻四百多万亩，平均亩产五百零五斤，并出现了成千上万的千斤亩，超过了早稻，赶上了中稻，打破了晚稻低产论。江西不论高山、平原或丘陵地区，一季晚稻和二季晚稻都获得了大丰收，据铜鼓、广丰、南昌三县来看，最低比去年增产百分之二十一，最高增产百分之七十。福建和浙江刚刚收割，就出现了许多千斤田。山西九百多万亩谷子也普遍获得大丰收，武乡大有红光人民公社一个管理区，有两亩试验田，亩产二千六百二十六斤半，创造了山西谷子单产最高纪录。
    本报长沙23日电　湖南省一千三百多万亩晚稻空前大丰收。到19日止，全省已收割四百多万亩晚稻，平均亩产干谷五百零五斤（过去平均只有二、三百斤），比大跃进的去年大大增产，超过了今年早稻，赶上了中稻。
    全省有名的水稻高产地区醴陵县，已收割脱粒的十五万多亩，平均亩产干谷七百四十五斤，单位面积产量比去年晚稻增长四成多，比今年早稻增产三成多，全县还出现了七十个千斤丰产大队和五百六十七个千斤丰产生产队。洞庭湖滨的益阳县今年战胜一百一十多天的干旱，夺取了双季晚稻大丰收。目前已收割的十六万多亩晚稻，平均每亩收干谷五百七十多斤，较去年晚稻增产将近一倍。安仁县十三万多亩晚稻，平均每亩产五百五十斤，其中有三分之一的田亩产八百斤以上。湘东革命老根据地攸县，已收割的二十八万多亩双季晚稻，平均亩收干谷六百六十斤，比今年早稻单位面积产量增长四成多，较去年晚稻增产八成多。
    双季晚稻大丰收再一次证明了人民公社的无比优越性。今年湖南省夏旱接秋旱，有许多地区连续七、八十天没有下透雨。各地公社展开大协作，一起出动，最多时有六百万人车水灌田，终于战胜了干旱。同时今年各地人民公社收获前后还都认真贯彻“八字宪法”，因此空前大丰收，打破了“晚稻低产论”。
    现在，全省双季晚稻收割工作已形成高潮。每天有三百多万名男女社员战斗在广阔的田野上。从洞庭湖滨到五岭山麓，纵横千里，喜庆丰收。
    本报南昌23日电　江西省一季晚稻的收割已基本结束，二季晚稻的收割正在展开。全省不论是高山、平原或丘陵、湖滨洼地，一季晚稻和二季晚稻都得到了大丰收。
