    Interplanetary Station Investigation Results
    Moon's Far Side is Redder Than the Near Side
    Xinhua News Agency, Almaty, 28th. According to the assessment of the photographs of the moon's far side obtained by Soviet scientists, the color of the moon's far side is slightly redder than the near side.
    This was stated to a TASS reporter by Teifel, a scientist from the Astro-Botanical Department of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic. This scientist specializes in the study of lunar spectra and lunar surface color characteristics.
    Teifel said that the difference in brightness between the various details on the far side of the moon is almost the same as the difference in the details on the near side. Thus, there is reason to believe that its far side is slightly redder than the near side, because on the far side, the red "continents" occupy more area than the light green "seas." The scientist also pointed out that the color in the southern part of the moon's far side is darker than in the northern part. He suggested that its southern region, in terms of its characteristics, may be a so-called "swamp" area, which is an area between "continent" and "sea."
    Finally, Teifel emphasized that the photographs obtained by the Soviet automatic interplanetary station have aroused great interest among astronomers and astro-botanists.

    行星际站考察结果
    月球背面颜色比正面红
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社阿拉木图消息：根据对苏联科学家所获得月球背面照片的判断，月球背面的颜色比正面要稍微红一些。
    这是哈萨克共和国科学院天体植物学部的科学家捷伊费尔对塔斯社记者说的。这位科学家专门从事月球光谱和月面色彩特性的研究。
    捷伊费尔说，月球背面各个细部之间在亮度上的差别，和月球正面各细部的差别几乎是一样的。这样，就有根据认为，其背面的颜色比正面稍红一些，因为，在背面上红色的“大陆”比浅绿色的“海”占有更多的面积。这位科学家还指出，在月球背面南部的颜色比北部更深一些。他设想说，它的南部区域按其特性来说，可能是一个介于“大陆”和“海”之间的所谓“沼泽”区域。
    最后，捷伊费尔强调说，苏联自动行星际站所获得的照片引起天文学家和天体植物学家们的极浓厚的兴趣。
