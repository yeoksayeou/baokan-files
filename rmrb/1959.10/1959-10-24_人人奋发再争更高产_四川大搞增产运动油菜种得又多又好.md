    Everyone Exerts Themselves Again to Strive for Higher Yields
    Sichuan Vigorously Carries Out a Production Increase Movement, Planting More and Better Rapeseed
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, October 23rd) Sichuan Province, in its autumn planting, has adopted the method of universally launching a large-scale rapeseed production increase and mobilizing the masses to plant rapeseed kings, vigorously carrying out a rapeseed production increase movement, making the rapeseed planting more, earlier, and better. As of the 16th, the province has sown three million mu of rapeseed, and various places are actively carrying out transplanting and continuing sowing work.
    This year, the rapeseed sowing work in the province has been universally grasped early, tightly, and quickly. As early as August, shortly after the autumn harvest began, various places organized forces, imparted technology, and prepared materials and tools, successively launching land turning and sowing seedling cultivation work. In the main rapeseed producing areas of the province, the Chengdu Plain, once the "End of Heat" passed, they comprehensively started rapeseed sowing work, a month earlier than last year. Zhong County, a nationally renowned high-yield rapeseed county, held a symposium on production increase experience as early as July, trained more than two thousand technicians, and each commune formed a rapeseed planting technical guidance committee, and then launched deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing throughout the county. Since late August, the county has mobilized 60,000 people every day to deeply plow all the rapeseed fields. In mid-September, Zhong County, Xindu, Mianzhu and other three counties initiated a challenge for a provincial rapeseed high-yield chain competition, and thus a vigorous rapeseed production increase movement was fully launched throughout the province.
    At the same time, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a notice to the people of urban and rural areas throughout the province, requiring various places to use scattered idle land to cultivate five to ten rapeseed king plants per person. Then, a mass movement to cultivate rapeseed kings was launched in urban and rural areas. All organs, factories, mines, schools, troops, commune members, and urban residents took action, seizing every opportunity, and actively planting large rapeseed plants. Their slogan is: "Plant and manage simultaneously, seedlings are strong, every plant becomes a king, every plant produces high yield." The people of Zhong County have planted more than 600 million "rapeseed kings," with an average of eight to ten plants per person in general areas, twenty-six plants per person in Chongqing, and twenty plants per person in Nanchong Prefecture.
    This year, all localities have tried every possible means to plant more and better rapeseed. The rapeseed planting area in Daxian Prefecture has expanded by 50% compared with last year, and Nanchuan, Zhong County, Dazhu, Jiangjin, Xinjin and other counties have expanded by 40% to more than double. Various places have also designated about 20% of high-yield fields, cultivated them intensively, strengthened management, and strived for high yields. In terms of sowing technology, various places have further conscientiously implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, generally using victory rapeseed improved varieties, with the area expanded more than last year, deeply plowing the land eight inches to one foot or more, applying more base fertilizer, appropriately densely planting, and strictly checking the sowing quality. In Daxian Prefecture, 600,000 mu of rapeseed land has been universally deeply plowed eight inches to one foot, applying more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and generally planting 8,000 to 10,000 plants per mu. Zhong County also carried out soil disinfection and pest control work while deeply plowing the land, universally burning all rice roots, and spraying them once with Ceresan and lime. People's communes in various places have organized management professional teams, established a responsibility system, while tightly grasping the continued sowing, while tightly grasping field management. Zhong County organized a management army of 30,000 people, implemented the management method of special personnel management, division of responsibility, measures to the block, responsibility to the person, and management to the plant.

    人人奋发再争更高产
    四川大搞增产运动油菜种得又多又好
    本报成都23日电　四川省在秋种中采取普遍开展油菜大面积增产和发动群众人人种油菜王的办法，大搞油菜增产运动，使油菜种得多、种得早、种得好。截至16日止，全省已播种油菜三百万亩，各地正在积极进行移栽和继续播种工作。
    今年全省油菜播种工作，普遍抓的早、抓的紧、播得快。早在8月间秋收刚开始不久，各地便组织力量、传授技术、准备物资工具，陆续展开翻地、播种育苗工作。全省油菜主要产区川西平原各地，“处暑”一过，便全面动手展开油菜播种工作，比去年提早一个月。全国著名油菜高产县忠县，早在7月间就召开了增产经验座谈会，训练了二千多名技术员，各公社组成了油菜种植技术指导委员会，接着在全县展开深翻地和积肥造肥。8月下旬以来，全县每天出动六万人，深翻了全部油菜田。9月中旬，由忠县、新都、绵竹等三县发起全省油菜高产连环竞赛的挑战，于是轰轰烈烈的油菜增产运动在全省范围内全面展开。
    同时，四川省农业厅向全省城乡人民发出通知，要求各地利用零星闲散的土地，每人培植油菜王五至十株。接着，在城乡间展开群众性培植油菜王运动，各机关、工矿、学校、部队、公社社员和城镇居民，人人动手，见缝插针，积极种植大株油菜。他们提出的口号是：“边种边管、苗苗健壮、株株成王、棵棵高产”。忠县城乡人民已栽种“油菜王”六亿多株，一般地区达到平均每人八至十株，重庆市达到每人二十六株，南充专区达到二十株。
    各地今年都千方百计把油菜种得多，种得好。达县专区油菜种植面积比去年扩大50％，南川、忠县、大竹、江津、新津等县都扩大40％到一倍以上。各地还划出20％左右的高产田，精耕细作，加强管理，力争高产。在播种技术上，各地进一步认真贯彻了农业八字宪法，一般采用胜利油菜良种面积都比去年扩大，深翻土地八寸到一尺以上多施了底肥，适当密植，并严格检查播种质量。达县专区六十万亩油菜地，普遍深翻八寸到一尺，每亩施底肥一万斤以上，一般每亩栽八千到一万株。忠县在深翻地同时还作了土壤消毒和治虫工作，普遍烧毁全部稻根，并用赛力散和石灰喷撒一遍。各地人民公社都组织了管理专业队，建立责任制，一边抓紧继续播种，一边抓紧田间管理工作。忠县组织了一支三万人的管理大军，实行了专人管理、分片包干、措施到块、责任到人、管理到株的管理办法。
