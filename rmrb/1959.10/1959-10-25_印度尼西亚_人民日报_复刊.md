Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 24th: The Indonesian Communist Party's organ, "People's Daily," resumed publication today. The Jakarta local military authorities had ordered the newspaper to temporarily cease publication from October 16th. According to an announcement by the Jakarta local military authorities, the reason for ordering the "People's Daily" to cease publication was that the newspaper had reported that people from all walks of life opposed Presidential Decree No. 6 of 1959 regarding changes to the local government system. This decree stipulates that local government heads, who were previously elected by local councils, would now be appointed by the President or the Minister of the Interior.

The Jakarta local military authorities rescinded the ban on the 23rd. The South Sumatra military authorities had previously banned the distribution of the "People's Daily" within its jurisdiction from October 5th for the same reason. This ban was rescinded on October 16th.

The "People's Daily" published an editorial today stating that during its suspension, the editorial department received many letters from readers and sympathizers, expressing their sincere concern.

    印度尼西亚“人民日报”复刊
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚共产党机关报“人民日报”今天复刊。雅加达地方军事当局曾经命令这家报纸从10月16日起暂时停刊。据雅加达地方军事当局宣布，命令“人民日报”停刊的理由是这家报纸曾经报道说，各阶层人民反对关于改变地方政府制度的1959年第六号总统决定。这项决定规定，以前由地方议会选举产生的地方政府首长改由总统或内政部长任命。
    雅加达地方军事当局在23日撤销了禁令。南苏门答腊的军事当局曾经以同样的理由从10月5日起禁止在它的辖区内发行“人民日报”，这项禁令已经在10月16日撤销。
    “人民日报”今天发表社论说，在它停刊期间，编辑部收到许多读者和同情者的来信，表示了他们的热诚的关怀。
