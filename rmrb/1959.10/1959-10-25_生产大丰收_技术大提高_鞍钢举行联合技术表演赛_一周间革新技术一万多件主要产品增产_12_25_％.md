Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 24th: The Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) recently held a joint technical performance competition week which achieved great results, proving that the technical performance competition is an effective method for modern enterprises to fully tap internal potential and develop production at high speed. Through the joint technical performance competition for a week, the output of An'gang's main products increased sharply by 12% to 25%, creating an unprecedentedly good situation for completing the annual plan to increase steel and steel products.

The An'gang Joint Technical Performance Competition, which started on the 15th, was carried out on the basis of anti-rightism, boosting morale, and the experience gained in the previous stage of the technical performance competition. It is a new development from dispersed to joint of the lively form of mass movement of technical performance competition. Because it is suitable for the characteristics of large-scale joint enterprises, and a series of preparations have been made ideologically, technically, organizationally, and materially in advance, once the mass movement of this joint technical performance competition was launched, its momentum was like a prairie fire, unstoppable, and the effect was better than imagined. All departments and all kinds of personnel, from mining to steel rolling, from production jobs to auxiliary jobs, from leading cadres to workers, were all involved in the torrent of the movement. Among the hundreds of thousands of employees in the company, more than 83% of the people directly participated in the technical performance, and the number of performances reached more than 870,000, which is more than three times the number of performances in the past two months. In the performance movement, production bottlenecks were broken through in large quantities, old rules and precepts were swept away one after another, everyone was full of spirit, everyone was full of vigor, new people and new things emerged vigorously, and the face of production was changing with each passing day. The production face of the whole company has undergone fundamental changes in one week. This not only powerfully attacked right-leaning conservative thinking, but also declared the ambition of the masses and greatly boosted people's confidence in completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

In this unprecedented technical performance competition movement, the communist style of daring to think and daring to do things was greatly developed by employees, technical innovation was carried out on a large scale, and production bottlenecks were broken through in large quantities. According to incomplete statistics, within a week, the employees of various factories and mines innovated more than 11,800 technologies, promoted more than 4,100 advanced experiences, broke through more than 5,200 production bottlenecks, and created more than 24,000 new production records. Several open-hearth furnaces in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant implemented innovative measures for pouring molten iron, increasing the charging amount by more than 16%; among them, the utilization coefficient of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace has continuously maintained 13.1, creating a new steelmaking record. The No. 10 giant blast furnace in the Ironmaking Plant implemented the operating methods of rapid slag discharge, rapid air addition, and rapid material running, and the utilization coefficient also broke through the "2" mark in one fell swoop, breaking the conservative thinking of some people who believed that the utilization coefficient of such a giant blast furnace could not break through "2". The employees of the Rolling Plate Plant reduced the number of rolling passes, increased the reduction, and increased the efficiency of steel rolling by 30%. After technical innovation in many factories and mines, a large number of technical bottlenecks that had not been broken through for a long time were broken through, and production efficiency was doubled.

An unprecedented situation of large-scale collaboration emerged in the joint technical performance competition. The transportation department, which had been a weak link in previous movements, has doubled its transportation efficiency this time due to the technical performance competition carried out together with various factories and mines, thus ensuring transportation under the conditions of greatly improved production and greatly increased transportation volume in various factories and mines. The Billet Mill, due to the technical performance competition carried out together with various steel rolling mills, greatly increased the production of steel billets. In this way, even though the output of steel products from various steel rolling mills has increased sharply by 25%, the supply of steel billets is still guaranteed. Mines, sintering, beneficiation, coking and other factories and mines have also greatly improved output and quality through technical performance competitions, and have done everything possible to support the production of ironmaking blast furnaces.

The secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the manager of An'gang, along with many cadres from various factories and mines, went deep into the front line to lead this time. According to incomplete statistics, more than 4,100 leading cadres from various factories and mines directly participated in the technical performance. Their in-depth work style greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers and masses.

Compared with the 14 days before the joint technical performance competition, in the recent week, An'gang's steel output increased by an average of 13.1% per day, pig iron increased by 12.2%, steel products increased by 25.4%, steel billets increased by 14.3%, and sintered ore increased by 10%. In this week, steel production exceeded the plan by more than 7,000 tons, iron increased by more than 4,200 tons, and steel products increased by more than 7,600 tons. Not only was there a great bumper harvest in production, but the technical level was also greatly improved.

In the past week, more than 24,000 advanced individuals and more than 880 advanced collectives have emerged from various factories and mines. It is truly a situation where new people and new things are emerging vigorously, and the face of production is changing with each passing day. At present, An'gang Company and various factories and mining enterprises are summarizing the experience of the joint technical performance competition, actively making various preparations, and are determined to continue to carry out the second joint technical performance competition week on the basis of consolidating the existing achievements, and push the production level to a new peak.

    生产大丰收　技术大提高
    鞍钢举行联合技术表演赛
    一周间革新技术一万多件主要产品增产12—25％
    新华社鞍山24日电　鞍钢最近举行的联合技术表演竞赛周取得了巨大成果，证明技术表演竞赛是现代化企业充分发挥企业内部潜力、高速度发展生产的有效方法。通过一周来的联合技术表演竞赛，鞍钢主要产品产量猛增12％到25％，为完成全年增产钢和钢材的计划开创了空前良好的局面。
    从15日开展的鞍钢联合技术表演竞赛，是在反右倾、鼓干劲和取得了前一阶段技术表演竞赛经验的基础上进行的，是技术表演竞赛这种群众运动的生动活泼的形式从分散到联合的新发展。由于它适合于大型联合企业的特点，事先又从思想上、技术组织上和物质上作了一系列的准备，这次联合技术表演竞赛的群众运动一经展开，其势就如燎原烈火，猛不可挡，效果之佳超出想像之外。各个部门，各种人员，从采矿到轧钢，从生产工种到辅助工种，从领导干部到工人，都卷入了运动的洪流中。全公司十几万职工中，有83％以上的人直接参加了技术表演，表演次数达八十七万多人次，等于过去近两个月来表演次数的三倍以上。表演运动中生产关键大量突破，陈规戒律纷纷扫除，人人意气风发，个个干劲昂扬，新人新事风起云涌，生产面貌日新月异，一周之内全公司生产面貌就发生根本的变化。这不仅有力地打击了右倾保守思想，也申张了群众的志气，大大鼓舞了人们提前和超额完成全年计划的信心。
    在这次空前规模的技术表演竞赛运动中，职工们敢想敢干的共产主义风格大发展，技术大革新，生产关键大量突破。据不完全统计，一周内，各厂矿职工革新技术一万一千八百多件，推广先进经验四千一百多项，突破生产关键五千二百多个，并且创造了两万四千多次生产新纪录。第一炼钢厂几个平炉实行兑铁水的革新措施，使装入量提高16％以上；其中四号平炉利用系数更连续保持着十三点一，创造了炼钢新纪录。炼铁厂十号巨型高炉实行快速放渣、快速加风、快速跑料的操作方法，利用系数也一举突破了“二”的大关，打破了某些人认为这样的巨型高炉利用系数不能突破“二”的保守思想。轧板厂职工减少了轧制道次，增加了压下量，提高轧钢效率30％。许多厂矿经过技术革新，大量的长期没有突破的技术关键突破了，生产效率成倍地提高了。
    联合技术表演竞赛中，出现了前所未有的大协作局面。在过去历次运动中都成为薄弱环节的运输部门，这次由于同各厂矿一起开展了技术表演竞赛，运输效率成倍提高，从而在各厂矿生产大提高、运输量大增加的情况下，保证了运输。初轧厂由于同各轧钢厂一起开展技术表演竞赛，使钢坯大量增产，这样，在各轧钢厂钢材产量猛增25％的情况下，仍然保证了钢坯的供应。矿山、烧结、选矿、炼焦等厂矿，也都通过技术表演竞赛大大提高产量和质量，千方百计地支援了炼铁高炉的生产。
    中共鞍山市委书记、鞍钢经理到各厂矿的许多干部，这次纷纷深入现场领导。据不完全统计，各厂矿直接参加技术表演的领导干部有四千一百多人。他们的深入的工作作风，大大鼓舞了职工群众的热情。
    同联合技术表演竞赛以前的十四天相比，最近一周鞍钢钢的产量平均每天提高13.1％，生铁提高12.2％，钢材提高25.4％，钢坯提高14.3％，烧结矿提高10％。在这一周内，钢比计划增产七千多吨，铁增产四千二百多吨，钢材增产七千六百多吨。不仅生产大丰收，技术水平也有很大提高。
    各厂矿一周来出现的先进人物有两万四千多名，先进集体八百八十多个。真个是新人新事风起云涌，生产面貌日新月异。目前，鞍钢公司和各厂矿企业都正在总结联合技术表演竞赛的经验，积极作好各项准备，决心在巩固已有成就的基础上，继续开展第二个联合技术表演竞赛周，把生产水平再推向一个新的高峰。
