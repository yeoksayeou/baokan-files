In the oil extraction area of the No. 2 Mining Area of the Old Junmiao Oil Extraction Plant of the Yumen Petroleum Administration, one often sees a person wearing oil-stained overalls and patrolling everywhere on a motorcycle, talking to workers here for a while, and then squatting next to the machine to listen to the sound of the machine and the oil output. This is Xue Guobang, the captain of Comprehensive Team Three.

Xue Guobang is a "patrolman" and also a "scout." He knows every oil well in the team even better than a careful mother knows her own child. He knows situations that others on the construction site are unaware of or have not yet discovered. Sometimes, when an accident occurs in an oil well, he rushes to rescue it at the critical moment, so that the oil well can return to normal production. He is very serious about his work, and he discusses every task with his team members beforehand. People praise Xue Guobang as a "red pacesetter" who appears wherever there is difficulty; he steps forward wherever there is danger to overcome it.

The Comprehensive Team Three led by Xue Guobang completed the annual crude oil production task thirty-seven days ahead of schedule in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, exceeding the quota by 2.9%. From January to September of this year, it exceeded the crude oil production task by 8%, achieving daily increase in production and monthly success. Especially after the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the team members were even more high-spirited and enthusiastic, and they threw themselves into the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy. Production records were refreshed daily, and the average daily production level increased sharply by 20% compared with the first quarter. Therefore, this team was named the "Leap Forward Team" by the Party Committee of the Bureau.

Xue Guobang often goes to the well site and eats, lives, and labors with the workers, and jointly studies and solves key production problems. He implements the management method of "frequent inspection, frequent adjustment, and frequent analysis" for more than 50 oil wells in the team, and achieves a scientific management system in which each well has records, analysis data, and management measures. He assigns specific personnel to be responsible for each well so that he has a clear understanding of each well. With these data, if any problem is found in the oil well, he can immediately prescribe the right medicine. Once, a new oil well did not produce oil. Xue Guobang consulted its drilling data in detail, conducted analysis and research, and held a three-way combination meeting attended by cadres, workers, and technicians, and put forward measures to make the oil well change from no oil production to intermittent oil production, and then from intermittent oil production to continuous free-flowing oil. Because they have taken a series of effective measures in oil well management, avoiding and reducing the occurrence of failures, the crude oil output has risen steadily. In early 1958, the daily crude oil output of this team was 300 tons, and later it jumped to 500 tons, 700 tons, and 840 tons per day. By the end of the year, it broke through the 1,000-ton mark, increasing a large amount of oil for the country.

In the first quarter of this year, the edge wells of Comprehensive Team Three were threatened by water flooding. Four high-yield oil wells were flooded, and the water content of fourteen oil wells increased day by day, seriously affecting crude oil production, reducing production by more than 200 tons per day. Faced with this difficult situation, some cadres became pessimistic and lacked confidence in completing the task. Under these circumstances, Xue Guobang stepped forward, on the one hand, mobilizing the masses to criticize negative emotions as much as possible, and on the other hand, discussing with everyone and taking timely measures to remove the threat of water flooding and rising water content, reversing the situation of declining crude oil production. There are a number of long-term closed oil wells in the Old Junmiao Oil Extraction Plant that cannot produce. People call these oil wells "stubborn wells." Xue Guobang often thought: To improve crude oil production and the utilization rate of oil wells, liberating the closed wells is one of the important ways. So he often considers ways to revive these oil wells. When the Party Committee of the plant put forward the slogan of "attacking 'stubborn wells' and improving the utilization rate of oil wells," he put forward the suggestion of blasting oil pipes, making six long-term closed "stubborn wells" regain their youth and return to normal production.

Xue Guobang not only took the lead in working hard and skillfully, but also helped others to carry out technical innovation. Comrade Li Guangming, the Party General Branch Secretary, put forward an important suggestion of using wire rope to replace sucker rods. He helped to carry it out, improved work efficiency, and saved a lot of steel for the country. One day in April this year, the Gobi Desert was blowing with a bone-chilling cold wind. The Comprehensive Team Three led by Xue Guobang was intensely "fracturing" the 237 oil well, using extremely high pressure to send crude oil with fine sand to hundreds of meters underground, to make the Gobi Desert yield oil. Everyone was intently staring at the wellhead. Suddenly, the oil supply pipe came loose, and the crude oil that was injected shot out from a small seam like a torrential black rain four or five meters away. This oil, when it touched people's skin, was more painful than a steel needle prick. This unexpected accident alarmed some workers. If they stopped the fracturing, the wellbore would be blocked by sand, causing a valuable oil well to be scrapped, which would affect the completion of the production task. If they continued, the exhaust pipe of the vehicle would burst with sparks, and there would be oil and gas everywhere in the well site. Moreover, there was an oil selection station nearby, and there was a risk of fire and explosion, which would cause even greater losses. At this time, everyone was staring at Xue Guobang, thinking: The oil well must not be scrapped, and the fire must not happen. Otherwise, the entire set of oil well fracturing equipment would be destroyed, and the operators would be in danger of life. At this critical moment, the sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member made him forget everything. He took off his cotton coat and rushed to the wellhead, threw himself on the place where the oil was spraying, wrapped the pipeline with his cotton coat, and pressed his chest against the loose oil pipe. The strong pressure made him sway and stagger, his whole body numb and unconscious. At this time, the workers present came forward one after another, wanting to replace him. But when he regained consciousness, he still insisted on not letting go, determined to fight to the end. After more than an hour of struggle, he did not let go until the oil well really spewed out thick black crude oil. When he saw that the well was producing oil smoothly and the output had increased fourfold, he felt indescribable joy in his heart.

    采油尖兵薛国邦
    在玉门石油管理局老君庙采油厂二矿场的采油区里，经常看到一个身穿沾满油渍的工作服、骑着摩托车到处巡逻的人，一会儿在这里和工人谈谈，一会儿又到机器旁边蹲下来，听听机器和出油的声音。这就是综合三队的队长薛国邦。
    薛国邦是个“巡逻兵”，也是个“侦察兵”。他对队里的每一口油井，比细心的母亲了解自己的孩子还要清楚。工地上别人不知道的或者还没有发现的情况，他早就掌握了。有时，油井发生了事故，在千钧一发的紧急关头，他就奋不顾身的去抢救，使油井正常生产。他对待工作很认真，每进行一项工作，都事先和队员们商量。人们都称颂薛国邦是个“红色标兵”，哪里有困难，他就在哪里出现；哪里有危险，他就挺身而出，战胜困难。
    薛国邦领导的综合三队，在大跃进的1958年，提前三十七天，超额2.9％完成了全年原油生产任务。今年1至9月份，又超额8％完成了原油生产任务，实现了日日增产，月月满堂红。特别是党的八届八中全会的公报和决议发表后，队员们更加意气风发，斗志昂扬，投入了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，生产纪录日日刷新，平均日产水平比第一季度猛增了20％。因此，这个队被局党委命名为“跃进队”。
    薛国邦经常到井场和工人们同吃同住同劳动，一道研究解决生产关键问题。对全队的五十多口油井，实行“勤检查、勤调整、勤分析”的管理方法，并且做到井井有记录、有分析资料、有管理措施的科学管理制度，专职专责，对每一口井都做到心中有数。有了这些资料，一发现油井有问题，就能马上对症下药。一次，有口新油井不出油，薛国邦就详细地查阅了它的钻井资料，进行分析研究，又召开干部、工人、技术员参加的三结合会议，提出了措施，使这口油井由不出油变为间歇出油，再由间歇出油变为连续自喷油。由于他们在油井管理上采取了一系列有效措施，避免和减少了故障的发生，使原油产量节节上升。1958年初这个队的原油日产量是三百吨，后来节节跃进到日产五百吨、七百吨、八百四十吨，到年底就突破了千吨大关，为国家增产了大量石油。
    今年第一季度，综合三队边部油井受到水淹的威胁，四口高产的油井被水淹没，十四口油井的含水量逐日上升，严重地影响原油产量，每天要减产二百多吨以上。面临这种困难情况，部分干部产生了悲观情绪，对完成任务缺乏信心。在这种情况下，薛国邦挺身而出，一面发动群众尽力批判消极情绪，一面和大伙一齐商量，及时采取措施，解除水淹油井和含水量上升的威胁，扭转了原油日产量下降的局面。老君庙采油厂有一批长期关闭的油井，不能生产，人们把这些油井叫“顽固井”。薛国邦经常想：要提高原油产量，提高油井利用率，解放关闭井，是重要的途径之一。所以他常考虑复活这些油井的办法。当厂党委提出“围攻‘顽固井’提高油井利用率”的口号时，他提出了爆油管的建议，使六口长期关闭的“顽固井”恢复了青春，正常投入生产。
    薛国邦不仅自己带头大干巧干，而且也帮助别人大搞技术革新。党总支书记李光明同志提出钢丝绳代替抽油杆的重要建议，他就帮着搞，提高了工效，为国家节约了大量的钢材。今年4月份的一天，戈壁滩上刮着刺骨的寒风，薛国邦领导的综合三队正紧张地给237油井进行“压裂”，用极高的压力把带着细砂的原油打到几百米的地下，要戈壁献出石油。大家都聚精会神地盯着井口看。突然供油管脱了口，打进去的原油从一个小缝中像倾盆的黑雨一样地射到四、五米以外。这种油碰到人的皮肤上，比钢针刺还疼。这意外的事故使有些工人惊慌起来。当时停车吧，井道就会被砂子堵死，使一口价值巨大的油井报废，影响生产任务的完成。继续压裂吧，车子排气管爆发着火花，井场上到处都是油气，附近又是选油站，很可能发生火灾爆炸的危险，造成的损失就更大了。这时大家都眼盯着薛国邦，他们想：油井千万不能报废，火灾决不能发生，否则，油井全套压裂设备将会被毁灭，操作工人有生命危险。就在这千钧一发的时刻，共产党员的责任感使他忘记了一切，脱下棉衣，向井口冲去，扑到喷油的地方，用棉衣裹住了管线，用胸脯贴住油管脱口。强烈的压力打得人东摇西摆，满身麻木，失去知觉。这时候，在场的工人同志，都争先恐后拥了上来，都想把他换下来。但他清醒过来的时候，仍然坚持不放，决心奋战到底。经过一个多钟头的搏斗，直到油井真正喷出黑呼呼的原油的时候，他才松开身子。当他看到这口井顺利出油而且产量提高四倍的时候，心里真有说不出的喜悦。
