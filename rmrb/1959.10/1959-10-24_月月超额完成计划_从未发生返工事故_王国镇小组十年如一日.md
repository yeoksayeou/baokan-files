Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 22nd: The Kingdom Town bricklaying group of the Second Engineering Area of the First Construction Company of Qinghai Province has exceeded its work plan every year and every month since its establishment in 1949. There have never been any personal accidents, large or small, and no quality rework accidents. The quality of the projects has consistently reached the level of excellent products, and this year's production tasks were completed more than three months ahead of schedule.

The Kingdom Town Group has attended advanced producer representative conferences in Qinghai Province, Xining City, and the whole country. Recently, it was also selected as a representative of advanced collectives to attend the National "Meeting of Heroes."

The main experience of the Kingdom Town Group in maintaining its honor day after day for ten years is adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. They closely attend to the political and ideological education of the workers, so that all workers clearly recognize the relationship between the individual and the country, and establish a high sense of responsibility as masters of the country in their work. After each task is accepted, they hold a group production meeting to carefully discuss the nature, construction period, quality, and characteristics of the engineering task. On the basis of improving everyone's thinking, they study ways to ensure project quality and safe production, and conscientiously implement them.

Kingdom Town and all the workers firmly established the idea of "a project of the century, quality first." When adopting new construction techniques in each project, high-skilled workers first experimented to make a sample, and then everyone offered opinions, pooled their wisdom, and then promoted it. In the construction process, they also selected workers with high skills and a strong sense of responsibility to serve as quality inspectors, responsible for checking the quality of the project, and implemented a "quality labeling system," checking the quality of each worker's project after work every day, discovering problems in time, and solving them. Because they treated project quality seriously, no quality accidents occurred due to rushing work, no matter how urgent the task was.

The Kingdom Town Group often humbly learns from the advanced experience of others and actively engages in technical innovation, so that production efficiency is continuously improved. Kingdom Town and all the workers jointly created and improved tools such as double-bucket mortar spreaders, bricklaying tightening devices, and mortar spreading rakes, increasing work efficiency by one to two times.

    月月超额完成计划　从未发生返工事故
    王国镇小组十年如一日
    据新华社西宁22日电　青海省第一建筑公司第二工区王国镇砌砖小组，自1949年成立以来，年年月月超额完成作业计划，从未发生过任何大小人身事故和质量返工事故，工程质量均衡地达到了优级品，并且提前三个多月完成了今年的生产任务。
    王国镇小组曾经出席过青海省、西宁市以及全国的先进生产者代表会议。最近又被评选为出席全国“群英会”的先进集体的代表。
    王国镇小组能够十年如一日地保持着荣誉，主要的经验是坚持政治挂帅，对工人的政治思想教育抓得紧，使全组工人清楚地认识到个人和国家的关系，在工作中树立了高度的主人翁责任感。他们每次接受任务后，就召开小组生产会议，对工程任务的性质、工期、质量、特点等进行仔细的讨论，在人人思想提高的基础上，研究出保证工程质量和安全生产的办法，认真贯彻执行。
    王国镇和全组工人牢固地树立了“百年大计，质量第一”的思想。在每一项工程中采用新的施工技术时，都先由技术高的工人试验作出样板，然后大家提意见，集思广益，再行推广。在施工过程中，他们还推选技术高、责任心强的工人担任质量检查员，负责检查工程质量，并且实行了“质量挂牌制”，在每天下班后，对每个工人的工程质量进行检查，及时发现问题，予以解决。由于他们严肃地对待工程质量，因此无论任务怎样紧迫，都没有因为赶工而发生质量事故。
    王国镇小组经常虚心地学习别人的先进经验，大闹技术革新，使生产效率不断提高。王国镇和全组工人一起创制和改进了双斗铺灰器、砌砖挂紧器、铺灰耙等工具，提高工作效率一倍到两倍。
