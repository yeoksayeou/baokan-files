Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Forty thousand square meters of Tiananmen Square and the broad Chang'an Avenue tonight became an ocean of gathered people, with more than 1.5 million people reveling in singing and dancing.

Tiananmen Square was like a "crystal world" tonight. The surrounding buildings were fully inlaid with lights, like a sea of stars. Before sunset, people brought Chinese and Western musical instruments such as erhus, flutes, sheng, suonas, drums, accordions, and violins, and poured into the square one after another.

Workers brought thousands of programs to the square to perform. In the worker dance circle of the Changxindian Communications Factory, a group of young men and women sang songs they composed themselves, praising the heroic deeds of Liu Yajun, a young lathe operator in the factory, who took the lead in completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and builders from the Baotou Iron and Steel Company met in front of the Cultural Palace. They danced hand in hand to celebrate the early commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Workers from the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory and the Beijing General Machinery Factory, and eight other factories, formed a 100-person orchestra and a 1,000-person dance area in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes. As soon as the workers from the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory finished performing the Workers' Red Flag Dance, workers from other factories started the Youth Dance. Next to this dance area, students from Beijing No. 128 Middle School and workers from the Beijing Metal Crafts Factory celebrated the festival together. Young women performed the dance "Greeting Chairman Mao."

On both sides of the square, the song "People's Commune is Good" resounded constantly, as commune members from the suburbs sang and danced to their hearts' content. Eighty commune members from the Si Ji Qing People's Commune, dressed in new clothes, danced and sang. Fu Derong, who had been a farmhand for landlords for eleven years before liberation, was wearing a new blue cloth coat and leather shoes. He danced more and more happily, sweating profusely.

Male and female students formed countless dance circles, like beautiful garlands clustered in front of the Jade Belt River. In the dance circle of Peking University, a group of young men and women wearing various ethnic costumes, waving their long sleeves, danced the "Universal Celebration Dance." International students from eighteen countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America danced the "Friendship Dance" with students from Peking University. Zhou Junliang, a student from the Department of Industrial Economics of the Renmin University of China who had won the title of labor and study model, danced one dance after another. This 26-year-old young man was still a small electrician at a power plant in Zigong City, Sichuan, ten years ago.

The officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who bravely defended the motherland joined the dance circles of workers, students, and cadres. Among them were veteran soldiers from the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, as well as heroes from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the bombardment of Jinmen. Wherever these defenders of the motherland went, warm applause rang out. Cui Baohai, a second-class meritorious person of a certain artillery unit, and others were immediately pulled into the dance circle by students from Beijing No. 15 Girls' Middle School when they entered the celebrating crowd, and happily danced the Youth Friendship Dance.

The celebration was in full swing, when suddenly a burst of autumn rain came from Miyun, and ten thousand pearls fell into the blue and soft beam of the searchlight. After the shower cleared the dust, the celebrating crowd became even more excited and active.

Young people of all ethnic groups, dressed in festive national costumes, gathered in front of the Jinshui Bridge and sang the song "The East is Red." In the bustling crowd, Tibetan girls Ciren Yangzong, Gesang Yangjing, Ciden Zhuoma, and Nima Pengduo, faced Tiananmen and sang the song "Singing the New Life of the Tibetan People." They were all students from serf or poor peasant backgrounds. Tibetan youths Ciwang Cuomu and Ciren Yuzhen waved their long sleeves and danced a self-composed Tibetan joyful dance.

With a burst of cannon-like sounds, festive fireworks competed to bloom in the sky, and the night sky of the capital was instantly decorated with colorful lights, and the clouds after the rain were also reflected into brilliant rosy clouds. The powerful beam of the searchlight seemed to turn the sky into a "silk umbrella," with fireworks flying in it. This year's fireworks had many new patterns. Some were as beautiful as silver trees blooming, some were as ingenious as butterflies making a scene among the stars, and some were like weeping willows and wheat ears in midsummer. The red light of the fireworks was reflected on countless happy faces. There was no moment more exciting than this. White-haired old people walked onto the streets with their children and grandchildren, young couples climbed Jingshan and White Pagoda with their babies, and many tall buildings were also filled with people, looking up at the sky above Tiananmen, and sharing the spectacle of this festive night. The fireworks lasted for a total of one hundred and forty minutes.

After midnight, the people on Tiananmen Square were still singing and dancing, and the capital was brightly lit everywhere. At this time, night shift workers far away from Tiananmen were fighting by the blast furnaces, in the mines, and in front of machine tools to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. In tomorrow's continued grand celebration, they will also show their talents in singing and dancing. (Attached picture)

    在天安门广场上歌唱十年的伟绩和光辉的未来
    首都一百五十万人狂欢
    新华社1日讯　四十万平方米的天安门广场和广阔的长安街，今晚成了人群汇集的海洋，一百五十多万人在这里尽情歌舞狂欢。
    天安门广场今夜像一座“水晶世界”。周围的建筑物，满镶灯炬，像星海一片。人们在夕阳西下以前，就带着二胡、笛管、笙箫、锣鼓、手风琴、小提琴等中西乐器，陆续涌进广场。
    工人们带着数以千计的节目来广场演唱。在长辛店通信工厂的工人舞圈里，一群小伙子和姑娘们在欢唱他们自编的歌曲，歌颂本厂青年车工刘雅君带头提前完成第二个五年计划的英雄事迹。石景山钢铁公司的工人们和包头钢铁公司的建设者相逢在文化宫前，他们携手跳舞，庆祝包钢一号高炉在建国十周年前夕提前投入生产。北京新华印刷厂和北京通用机械厂等八个工厂的工人，在人民英雄纪念碑前组成了百人大乐队，千人大舞区。北京广播器材厂的工人刚表演完工人红旗舞，其他工厂的工人又跳起青年舞。在这个舞区旁边，北京市一百二十八中学的学生和北京市金属工艺工厂工人一起欢庆佳节。青年姑娘们表演了“问候毛主席”的舞蹈。
    广场两侧不断响起“人民公社好”的歌声，这是来自郊区人民公社的社员们在尽情歌舞。四季青人民公社的八十个社员，穿着新衣，边舞边唱。解放以前曾经给地主当过十一年雇工的傅德荣，身着新蓝布衣，脚穿皮鞋。他越跳越欢，跳得满头大汗。
    男女学生们围成无数个舞圈，好像美丽的花环拥簇在玉带河前。在北京大学的舞圈里，一群穿着各种民族服装的男女青年，摆动着长袖，在跳“普天同庆舞”。欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲等十八个国家的留学生，和北京大学的学生们一块儿跳着“友谊舞”。曾经获得劳动、学习模范称号的中国人民大学工业经济系学生周俊良，跳了一个舞曲又一个舞曲。这个二十六岁的小伙子十年前还是四川自贡市电厂的小电工。
    英勇捍卫祖国的陆、海、空军官兵加入了工人、学生和干部们的舞圈。他们当中有抗日战争、解放战争时代的老战士，也有抗美援朝和万炮轰金门的英雄。这些祖国保卫者走到那里，那里就响起热烈的掌声。炮兵某部二等功臣崔宝海等走进狂欢的人群时，立即被北京市第十五女子中学的学生拉进了舞圈，欢乐地跳起青年友谊舞。
    狂欢正酣，忽然密云带来了一阵秋雨，蓝色的柔和的探照灯光柱中落进了万点珍珠。欢腾的人群在阵雨洗尘过后更加兴奋活跃起来。
    各民族的青年穿着节日的民族盛装，团聚在金水桥前，高歌“东方红”歌曲。在熙熙攘攘的人群中，藏族姑娘次仁央宗、格桑央京、次登卓玛和尼玛彭多，面对天安门唱起了“歌颂西藏人民的新生”的歌曲，她们都是农奴或贫农出身的学生。藏族青年次旺错姆、次仁玉珍等挥舞长袖，跳起自编的藏族欢乐舞。
    随着连珠炮般的声响，节日的礼花凌空竞放，首都的夜空顿时被打扮得五彩缤纷，雨后的云层也被映成了灿烂的彩霞。探照灯的强大光柱好像把苍空变成一柄“绫罗伞”，礼花在其中飞舞。今年的礼花有很多是新花样。有的美如银树开花，有的巧如群蝶闹星，有的又像盛夏垂柳和麦穗。礼花的红光映现在无数的欢乐的面孔上。没有什么时刻比现在更使人兴奋了。白发苍苍的老人扶着儿孙走上街头，青年夫妇抱着宝宝登上景山、白塔，许多高大建筑物的平台上也站满了人，仰望天安门上空，共赏这节日之夜的奇景。礼花一共放了一百四十分钟。
    午夜已过，欢乐在天安门广场上的人们仍然载歌载舞，首都到处灯光辉煌。这时，远离天安门的夜班工人们，正在高炉旁、矿井下和机床前，为今年提前完成第二个五年计划而奋战，在明天的继续大狂欢中，他们又将在歌舞上大显身手。（附图片）
