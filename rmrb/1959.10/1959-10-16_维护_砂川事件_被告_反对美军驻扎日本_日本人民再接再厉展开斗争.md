Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th. Japanese democratic groups and representatives of Sunagawa town residents held a meeting on the 13th, deciding to continue their struggle to support the Tokyo District Court's ruling that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violates the Japanese constitution and that the defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" are not guilty.

The Japanese Supreme Court will make a judgment on the "Sunagawa Incident" in mid-December. The "Sunagawa Incident" occurred in the summer of 1957. At that time, the Japanese authorities arrested seven workers and students who opposed the expansion of the U.S. military's Tachikawa military base, and the Japanese procuratorial authorities had demanded that these seven patriots be sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Later, the Tokyo District Court declared the defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" not guilty. However, the Kishi Nobusuke group incited the procuratorial authorities to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held an oral argument on the "Sunagawa Incident" in mid-September.

October 13th marked the third anniversary of the large-scale launch of the struggle by the Japanese people against the expansion of the Tachikawa Air Force Base. At the meeting commemorating the third anniversary, representatives of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions, the National Liaison Council on Base Issues, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, as well as the defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident," defense lawyers, and members of the Anti-Expansion Tachikawa Base League unanimously passed a resolution to strengthen the struggle.

The meeting emphasized that the people must understand the relationship between the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the Japanese constitution. On the same day, residents and religious figures in Sunagawa town also held a gathering in Sunagawa town to commemorate the third anniversary of their opposition to the expansion of the U.S. military's Tachikawa base.

The "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) and the National Conference for the Defense of the Constitution are inviting the defendants in the "Sunagawa Incident" and their defense lawyers to report on the situation of the debates held in the Supreme Court in mid-September to various parts of Japan.

　　维护“砂川事件”被告　反对美军驻扎日本
    日本人民再接再厉展开斗争
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本民主团体和砂川镇居民的代表13日举行会议，决定继续展开斗争，支持东京地方裁判所关于宣布美军驻在日本是违反日本宪法和“砂川事件”被告无罪的判决。
    日本最高裁判所将在12月中旬就“砂川事件”作出判决。“砂川事件”发生在1957年夏季。当时日本当局对反对美军扩大立川军事基地的七名工人和学生横加逮捕，日本检查当局曾经要求对这七名爱国者判处六个月徒刑。后来，东京地方裁判所宣判“砂川事件”被告无罪。但是，岸信介集团又唆使检查当局向最高裁判所起诉。最高裁判所在9月中旬举办了“砂川事件”的口头辩论。
    10月13日是日本人民大规模地展开反对扩大立川空军基地斗争三周年。在纪念三周年的大会上，日本工会总评议会、东京地方工会评议会、全国基地问题联络会议、禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的代表，以及“砂川事件”的被告、被告辩护律师和反对扩大立川基地联盟的成员在纪念会上一致通过加强斗争的决议。
    会议着重指出，必须使人民认清修改“安全条约”同日本宪法的关系。同一天，砂川镇的居民和宗教人士还在砂川镇举行集会，纪念反对美军扩大立川基地三周年。
    “总评”和拥护宪法国民会议正在请“砂川事件”被告和被告辩护律师到日本各地报告9月中旬在最高裁判所进行辩论的情况。
