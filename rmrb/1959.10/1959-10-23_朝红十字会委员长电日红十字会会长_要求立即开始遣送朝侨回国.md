Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. Kim Ung-gi, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross, telegraphed Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross, on the 19th, expressing the expectation that the Japanese side will strictly adhere to the agreement, ensuring that the human rights of Korean residents in Japan are not violated, that they are not subjected to ethnic humiliation or any external coercion, and that measures are taken to enable them to freely return to their homeland according to their own will, so as to promote the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan without delay.

The telegram expressed deep regret that the repatriation work of Korean residents in Japan has been brought to a serious standstill due to inappropriate clauses in the so-called "Repatriation Guidelines" formulated by the Japanese side.

The telegram said: We believe that the important issue now is to immediately start the repatriation registration work for Korean residents in Japan, which has not yet begun in practice. The telegram said that Korean residents in Japan are now ready to depart, and are in a state of having no clothes, no food, and no place to live. Their repatriation work can no longer be delayed.

The telegram concluded by saying that the Korean side has made all preparations and can send ships at any time to welcome the Korean residents in Japan back to their homeland, depending on the progress of the repatriation work. (Attached picture)

October 2nd, Korean residents in Tokyo demonstrated in front of the Japanese Red Cross, protesting the delay in their repatriation.

    朝红十字会委员长电日红十字会会长
    要求立即开始遣送朝侨回国
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长金应基19日打电报给日本红十字会会长岛津忠承，表示期待日本方面严格根据协议，使旅日朝侨的人权不受蹂躏，不受民族侮辱和任何外力的强迫，采取措施使他们能够根据自己的意志自由回国，以毫不迟延地推进旅日朝侨归国的工作。
    电报对由于日本方面制定的所谓“归国指南”中的不适当的条款而使旅日朝侨的归国工作陷于严重的停顿状态表示十分遗憾。
    电报说：我们认为，现在重要的问题是立即开始事实上尚未着手的旅日朝侨的归国登记工作。电报说，旅日朝侨现在已整装待发，陷于无衣无食无处居住的境地，再也不能拖延他们的归国工作了。
    电报最后说，朝鲜方面已作好了一切准备，随着旅日朝侨归国工作的进展情况，任何时候都可以派出船只去迎接旅日朝侨回国。（附图片）
    10月2日，东京朝侨在日本红十字会门前示威，抗议拖延遣送他们回国。
