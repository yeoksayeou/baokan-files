Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th -- A new type of surveying instrument, the "Tachymeter Without Stadia Rods," which does not require running the rod to measure terrain, has recently been successfully trial-produced in Shanghai.

In the past, when surveying terrain, surveying workers had to hold heavy stadia rods and run the rod in high mountains and dense forests, which was very labor-intensive and the measurement speed was slow.

At the National Surveying Work Conference this spring, it was decided that a trial production team composed of five units, including the Shanghai Survey and Design Institute, would study and trial-produce instruments with the required precision. After great efforts, they finally overcame many problems for which calculation formulas could not be found in books and completed the design. The workers of the Shanghai Jingming Instrument Factory, who were responsible for the trial production, displayed soaring enthusiasm and successfully trial-produced the instrument before National Day.

    无标尺地形仪
    测量地形不需要跑尺
    据新华社上海9日电　一种测量地形不需要跑尺的新型测量仪器——“无标尺地形仪”，最近在上海试制成功。
    过去测量地形，测量工人要持着笨重的标尺，在高山丛树中跑尺，劳动强度很高，测量速度也慢。
    今年春季全国测量工作会议上，决定由上海勘测设计院等五个单位组成试制小组，研究试制精密度符合要求的仪器。他们经过很大的努力，终于攻克了许多书本上找不到计算公式的难题，完成了设计。负责试制的上海竞明仪器厂的工人，发挥了冲天干劲，在国庆前夕试制成功。
