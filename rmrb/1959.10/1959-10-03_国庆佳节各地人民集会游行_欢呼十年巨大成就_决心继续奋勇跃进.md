Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: On October 1st, the whole country rejoiced. All provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals, and many small and medium-sized cities across the country held grand rallies and parades on this day. People's communes in various places also held various celebration activities, warmly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    At the celebration rallies across the country, people from all walks of life happily reported to the Party and the motherland the great achievements they had created on all fronts over the past ten years. Local Party or government leaders called on people from all walks of life to resolutely implement the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and continue to forge ahead to complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule and above quota.

    Heilongjiang
    In Harbin, an industrial city in northern China, a grand parade with 200,000 people was held on the 1st. Distinguished guests from the four delegations of the Soviet Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai, Amur Oblast, and Sakhalin Oblast, who were invited to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Heilongjiang Province, as well as personnel from the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin, and Soviet and other fraternal countries' experts who are helping China's construction in Heilongjiang Province, all participated in the observation ceremony. Various charts held high by the nearly 100,000-strong workers' contingent showed that Harbin's total industrial output value has increased a full hundredfold compared to pre-liberation. These achievements are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great ally, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries. The parading crowd constantly shouted "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" and waved bouquets to thank the Soviet guests and experts from various fraternal countries. On the 1st, millions of workers, peasants, and people from other walks of life in various parts of Heilongjiang also held grand parades to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, celebrating the great victory of Heilongjiang Province's leap from the historically poor and backward "Great Northern Wilderness" to the "Great Northern Granary" rich in grain and timber and one of the country's new important industrial bases.

    Jilin
    More than 300,000 people from all walks of life in Changchun, Jilin Province, gathered for a parade. At the front of the parade was an industrial contingent. Charts, physical objects, and models carried by the workers prominently demonstrated that Changchun has transformed from a consumer city with basically no backbone industry before the founding of the country into a mechanical industry city centered on the automobile industry, including vehicles, locomotives, tractors, and other power machinery. The First Automobile Factory's contingent consisted of batches of "Red Flag" brand sedans, "East Wind" brand sedans, "Liberation" brand trucks, and three-axle off-road vehicles. This factory has developed from originally designing and producing one type of truck to now being able to produce a variety of automobiles.

Steel workers also wanted to strive to exceed 20% of the annual plan for pig iron this year. Dozens of charts carried by a contingent of 10,000 people's commune members from the suburbs showed that the province had only more than 4 million mu of irrigated land before liberation, and now it has increased to more than 20 million mu; the total grain output in 1958 increased by more than two times compared with 1949, and cotton increased by more than two times.

A year ago, there was no iron or steel produced here, but today the molten iron is flowing, and the steel flowers are blooming, and more than 600,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral tools have been manufactured using locally produced steel. The national unity contingent composed of workers, cadres, and students from Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Tu, Salar, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups is a concrete manifestation of the great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Many young Mongolian and Tibetan men and women were still oppressed and bullied by reactionary herd owners a year ago, and some were even slaves without personal freedom; now they have become the masters of the country.

    Sichuan

The workers of the newly built Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant walked at the forefront of the workers' parade. The emergence of this iron and steel joint enterprise ended the history of the western Sichuan Plain only producing grain and not steel. In the vast workers' parade, there were advanced producers in steel, machinery, electricity, light industry, and chemical industry, many of whom had completed the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan and this year's tasks ahead of schedule. Suburban farmers, coming from all directions with the joy of harvest to participate in the parade, carried the big characters "Long Live the People's Commune" and advanced with high spirits.

Since they came to Guizhou last year, they have broken through the thousands of mountains in Qian, changed the transportation conditions of Guizhou, where "there is no three miles of flat land," and laid down the steel artery for the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou. More than a thousand Han, Miao, and Bouyei commune members from the suburbs used grain and vegetables to make various bumper harvest towers and bumper harvest pavilions to participate in this solemn ceremony.
