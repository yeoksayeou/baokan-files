Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Autumn vegetables in the northern provinces, regions, and major cities are coming onto the market in large quantities. This year, northern regions have achieved bumper harvests of autumn vegetables. Currently, various localities are rushing to harvest, transport, store, and process vegetables. Regions that have not yet begun large-scale harvesting are also actively preparing for storage.

Currently, the autumn vegetable harvest in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia is basically complete, and partial harvesting is underway in North China. This year, due to the attention paid to autumn vegetable production by leaders at all levels, the planting area has been expanded, management has been improved, and growth has been excellent. As a result, autumn vegetables have generally seen significant increases in production. The quantity of vegetables for farmers' own consumption and for commercial sale has increased significantly compared to last year. Liaoning Province's 3.27 million mu of autumn vegetables are expected to yield an average of over 3,700 jin per mu, with the total output doubling compared to last year. Heilongjiang Province's total autumn vegetable production is expected to increase by approximately 25% compared to last year. Harbin City's total autumn vegetable production has more than doubled compared to last year, with commercially available vegetables reaching over 910 million jin, nearly tripling last year's figure. Based on a per capita consumption of 1.5 jin of vegetables per day, this can supply the city for over eight months without the need to import vegetables from other provinces. Employees in forest areas in the northernmost parts of Heilongjiang Province, such as Huma and Mohe, will be able to eat vegetables they have grown themselves until May of next year. The autumn vegetables produced this year in cities such as Xi'an, Xianyang, Tongchuan, Baoji, and Xingping in Shaanxi Province are expected to increase more than threefold compared to last year. Based on a per capita consumption of 2 jin of vegetables per day, this can supply these five cities for over seven months. Autumn vegetables in Beijing are also coming onto the market in large quantities, with daily market supply reaching over 4 million jin. Cabbage for cellar storage, which can only be harvested around the Beginning of Winter (approx. Nov 7), generally grows to six or seven jin per head, promising a bumper harvest. Autumn vegetables in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces are also expected to have a significant increase in production compared to last year.

Due to the large harvest volume of autumn vegetables this year, the concentrated harvesting period, and the high demand for labor, as well as the heavy transportation tasks, all regions have strengthened leadership in vegetable harvesting, processing, and storage to ensure proper harvesting and storage, guaranteeing the vegetable supply for this winter and next spring. According to relevant departments, sixty-three large and medium cities and industrial and mining areas in the north have all made plans for autumn vegetable storage and processing. In addition to actively storing vegetables themselves, commercial departments in various regions are actively organizing large-scale cooperation among communes, organizations, and residents to store large quantities of autumn vegetables. Heilongjiang Province requires all regions to store 300 jin of vegetables per capita based on the urban population. Harbin, Qiqihar, Yichun, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Hegang six cities plan to store this year more than 1.43 billion jin of vegetables, processing more than 70 million jin of processed vegetables, with storage and processing both increasing compared to last year. Harbin City alone plans to store 730 million jin, an increase of 239% compared to last year, and will also pickle an average of 20 jin of salted vegetables per person. Currently, over 95% of vegetable cellars in Harbin have been dug, and more than 126 million jin of potatoes and cabbage have been put into cellars for storage. More than 500 collective catering units such as organs, factories and schools across the city have purchased vegetables from people's communes in the near suburbs, and immediately dug cellars on land borrowed from the communes for storage. Cities such as Shenyang, Fuxin, Fushun, Anshan, Andong and Xinmin in Liaoning Province recently convened vegetable production and sales meetings, and specifically arranged autumn vegetable storage tasks. Shenyang City is launching a "One Jar of Vegetables Movement", requiring residents throughout the city to store 100 jin of vegetables per person, one jar of pickled vegetables per household. Various organizations, groups and other collective catering units have directly linked up with people's communes in the suburbs, placing signs in the vegetable fields, with the purchasing units harvesting and storing the vegetables themselves. Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan and other eight cities in Jilin Province have universally increased their vegetable storage plans by more than double compared to last year, with Liaoyuan and Tonghua increasing by fourteen and twenty-four times respectively compared to last year.

Other provinces, cities, and regions are also actively storing vegetables and preparing to store vegetables. Qinghai has already stored more than 90 million jin of green vegetables, dried vegetables, and pickled vegetables. Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Beijing are all actively carrying out vegetable storage work.

Various localities have also created many vegetable cellars that do not use wood. The corridor-style, bungalow-style, and bridge-style wood-free vegetable cellars trial-built in Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, ensure that autumn vegetables are put into cellars in a timely manner, saving a large amount of wood. In vegetable storage, people's communes in various regions have also stored many seed mother plants for replanting and harvesting seeds next spring. At the Beijing Vegetable Storage Seed Selection Exchange Meeting, experiences in seed selection and retention and mother plant storage were particularly exchanged.

    北国秋菜大丰收
    六十三个大中城市和工矿区动手贮菜
    新华社27日讯　北方各省、区、各大城市的秋菜正大量上市。今年北方各地的秋菜获得了大丰收，现在各地正在突击抢收、抢运、抢贮、加工蔬菜；还未大收秋菜的地区，也在积极准备收贮工作。
    现在，东北和内蒙古各地秋菜已经基本收完，华北各地部分秋菜也在收获。今年由于各地领导抓紧了秋菜生产，种植面积扩大，管得好，长得好，现在秋菜普遍获得大增产；农民自食菜和商品菜的数量都比去年有很大的增加。辽宁全省三百二十七万亩秋菜，预计平均亩产可达三千七百斤以上，总产量将比去年增加一倍。黑龙江全省秋菜预计将比去年增产25％左右。哈尔滨市的秋菜总产量比去年增加了一倍以上，商品菜可达九亿一千多万斤，比去年增加近三倍，按每人每日吃菜一斤半计算，可供全市吃八个多月，不需再从外省运进蔬菜。黑龙江省最北部的呼玛、漠河等林区职工自种的蔬菜可吃到明年5月。陕西省西安、咸阳、铜川、宝鸡、兴平等城市今年生产的秋菜，预计将比去年增产三倍多，按每人每日吃菜两斤计，可供五个城市吃七个多月。北京市的秋菜也已经大量上市，每日上市量达四百多万斤。到立冬才能收的窖贮白菜，一般一棵长到六、七斤，丰收在望。河北、河南、山东、山西各地的秋菜都将比去年有较大的增产。
    由于今年秋菜的收获量很大，收获期集中，需要的劳力多，运输任务繁重，各地都加强了收菜、加工、贮菜等工作的领导，保证收好、贮好，保证今冬明春的蔬菜供应。据有关部门了解：北方六十三个大、中城市和工矿区都已作了秋菜贮藏、加工的计划。各地商业部门除自己积极储菜外，正积极组织公社、机关、居民等方面大协作，大量储备秋菜。黑龙江省要求各地按城市人口每人贮菜三百斤。哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、伊春、牡丹江、佳木斯、鹤岗六城市今年准备贮菜十四亿三千多万斤，加工菜七千多万斤，贮菜和加工菜都比去年增多；仅哈尔滨市就准备贮藏七亿三千万斤，比去年增加239％，另外按人平均每人还将腌咸菜二十斤。现在哈尔滨全市已挖好菜窖95％以上，已有一亿二千六百多万斤的土豆和白菜下窖贮好。全市已有五百多个机关、工厂、学校等集体伙食单位向近郊人民公社购菜后，立即由公社借地挖窖贮藏。辽宁省沈阳、阜新、抚顺、鞍山、安东、新民等市最近都召开了蔬菜产销会议，具体安排了秋菜贮藏的任务。沈阳市正开展“一缸菜运动”，要求全市居民每人贮菜一百斤，每户腌菜一缸，各机关团体等集体伙食单位已向郊区人民公社直接挂钩，在菜地插上标志，由购买单位自己收、自己贮。吉林省长春、吉林、四平、辽源等八个城市贮菜计划普遍比去年增加一倍以上，其中辽源和通化两市分别比去年增加十四倍和二十四倍。
    其他各省、市、区也正积极贮菜和准备贮菜。青海已贮藏了青菜、干菜、腌菜等共九千多万斤。河北、河南、陕西和北京市都在积极进行贮菜工作。
    各地还创造了许多不用木材的菜窖，辽宁省新民县试建的走廊式、平房式、桥梁式三种无木菜窖，保证秋菜及时入窖，节省了大量的木材。各地人民公社在贮菜中，还贮藏了很多留种母株，以便明春复种收获种籽。北京市在蔬菜储藏选种交流会上，特别交流了选种留种及母株贮藏的经验。
