Strive to Complete This Year's Industrial Production Plan Ten to Fifteen Days Ahead of Schedule

What is the current state of our country's economy? Our answer is: very good, very good, very good! Such an economic situation, with the masses’ soaring enthusiasm and booming production, means that the 1959 national economic plan will not only be successfully completed but can also be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. This year, our national economy is likely to achieve a continued great leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward.

The most important characteristic of the current situation on the industrial front is the rapid and comprehensive growth of production. Production in August and September rose in a straight line. The total industrial output value in August increased by 14% compared to July, and the total industrial output value in September increased by about 27% compared to August. Steel production in August increased by 13.5% compared to July, and in September it increased by 20% compared to August. Coal production in August increased by 11.5% compared to July, and in September it increased by 18% compared to August. From January to September, the total industrial output value increased by 45.5% compared to the same period last year, steel production increased by 67%, and coal production increased by 72%. The output of major products such as steel, pig iron, electricity generation, metal cutting machine tools, crude oil, hydro turbines and steam turbines, power machinery, tractors, and combine harvesters from January to September this year has exceeded the total output of the great leap forward year of 1958. Petroleum, chemical products, building materials, and other industrial products have also seen significant growth. In these nine months, the national freight volume increased by 69% compared to the same period last year, the total purchase of commodities increased by 42% compared to the same period last year, the total retail sales of commodities increased by 16% compared to the same period last year, and commodity inventory at the end of September increased by 22% compared to the same period last year, presenting a prosperous scene in the market. The insufficient supply of a small number of commodities that occurred at the beginning of this year has been fundamentally improved.

Such an extremely favorable economic situation has been formed on the basis of the great leap forward since last year. The Central Committee's instructions in early August on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy have had a decisive impact on the entire economic situation. In just a few days, the call to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, vigorously increase production and practice economy" became the practical action of the broad masses. After the broad masses acted, they immediately paid attention to more, faster, better, and more economical results, and paid attention to high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety. The counterpart competitions between industries, enterprises, workshops, groups, and workers of the same type, as well as the "one-dragon" competitions between upper and lower processes, have been rapidly launched. Large-scale and small-scale comparisons, large-scale and small-scale exchanges, large-scale and small-scale visits, and large-scale and small-scale collaborations have also been carried out enthusiastically. This has made this production increase and economy drive very comprehensive and healthy, and thus able to achieve practical results extremely quickly, creating an extremely favorable economic situation. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, although our country's economic situation was also good, with a large increase in the total industrial output value each month compared to the same period last year, due to a brief right-leaning small typhoon in the middle, the output of some products in June and July decreased, forming a "small saddle shape." After the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to "oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale" was issued, the situation immediately improved rapidly. This once again proved the truth that "morale can be boosted but not discouraged," proved that the general line of socialist construction is completely correct, and proved that we must thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, hold high the banner of the general line of socialist construction, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously promote mass movements in order to achieve high-speed development of the national economy.

At present, this magnificent production increase and economy drive is still developing, and the production potential is still very large. The task before us is to continue to thoroughly expose and criticize right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning activities, thoroughly overcome the right-leaning slackening phenomenon and the empty talk style of shouting difficulties and not grasping the solution of practical problems, earnestly boost morale, and take effective measures in every possible way to consolidate the current upsurge of mass production increase and economy drive, continuously develop it, and strive to complete the year's production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and arrange the production and construction tasks for next year in the fourth quarter of this year. This is a great task. Completing the year's production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule and arranging the production and construction tasks for next year in the fourth quarter of this year will not only realize the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and create good conditions for the great leap forward next year and in the future; but also allow us to win time to do a better job of preparing for production in the first quarter of next year, strive for a "good start" next year, and strive to maintain and exceed the production level of the fourth quarter of this year in the first quarter, laying the foundation for the great leap forward in 1960. With the foundation of the three-year great leap forward from 1958 to 1960, we can strive to catch up with Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in a shorter time than ten years.

In order to better complete the tasks in the fourth quarter of this year and complete the year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target, workers on all fronts must continue to make unremitting efforts to steadily increase the output of various products. This steady increase is to be calculated by the ten-day period. This means that we not only require that the production in this quarter is higher than the production in the previous quarter, and that the production in this month is higher than the production in the previous month, but also require that the production in this ten-day period is higher than the production in the previous ten-day period. We must consolidate the existing achievements and eliminate forever the saddle shape in the past where the production level at the beginning of the month was always lower than at the end of the previous month. This saddle shape has often repeatedly appeared in many enterprises in the past, and seems to have become a "routine." Many people regard it as an inevitable "objective law" in the development of production, which seems to be unchangeable. As a result, they unconsciously relax their fighting spirit. They originally had the potential to strive to prevent the production level at the beginning of the month and the beginning of the year from falling, and to steadily improve on the basis of the level at the end of the previous month and the end of the previous year, but they did not actively strive for it. Is the saddle shape really an inevitable "law"? The production performance in August and September proves that it is not at all. On the contrary, it is caused by human factors. It is caused by the failure to organize the supply of raw materials, or by rushing to produce at the end of the month and the end of the year, failing to repair equipment in time, and failing to arrange the workers' labor and rest well. These are all man-made factors, not objective laws. This "routine" is completely changeable. In fact, many enterprises have already broken this "routine." In these enterprises, whether it is at the beginning of the year or the beginning of the month, production is a straight-line rise from one peak to another, or at least stable at the level of the end of the previous year and the end of the previous month, with no decline at all. An even more powerful proof is that in August and September this year, more enterprises generally broke this "routine," and the production of many important products eliminated the saddle shape nationwide. For example, steel and pig iron, whose daily output at the beginning of the month used to be 7%-8% lower than in the last ten days of the previous month, increased by 8%-11% respectively in the first ten days of September compared to the last ten days of August. What we were able to do in August and September, we will definitely be able to do in October, November, and December. In fact, in the few days after National Day, the workers of many enterprises have already realized their promise of "a good start after the festival." We must continue to boost morale, strive for the upstream, grasp the solution of practical problems, establish a new and true production routine of stable rise, ensure that the production at the beginning of October is stably improved on the level of the end of the previous month, ensure that the production at the beginning of November is stably improved on the level of the end of October, ensure that the production at the beginning of December is stably improved on the level of the end of November, and ensure that the production at the beginning of next January is stably improved on the level of the end of this December.

We must not only create a new routine of stable increase in production at the beginning of the month and the beginning of the year, but also establish a new routine of comprehensive leap forward in output, quality, cost, and safety. More, faster, better, and more economical results are inherently linked. More and faster must be more and faster with good quality and economy, and good quality and economy must be good quality and economy with more and faster results. They are indivisible from each other. However, in the past, many comrades believed that they could only leap forward in one or two aspects, but could not improve quality and reduce costs while increasing output. Some comrades even believed that this was also a "law that does not depend on people's will." In fact, this is not an objective law, but completely changeable. This "routine" has also been generally broken in August and September. In August and September, whether it was the production of raw materials such as steel, iron, and coal, or the production of processing industries such as machinery, not only the output increased month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period, but also the quality increased month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period, and the cost also decreased month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period, and the production was also very safe. There were fewer equipment accidents and personal accidents than at any time in the past. Since we were able to achieve comprehensive leap forward with more, faster, better, and more economical results, and safely and with appropriate labor and rest in August and September, we will definitely be able to do so in the future, and we must do so.

In order to promote the further development of the production upsurge and ensure that the production upsurge can be stable and sustainable, and comprehensively exceed the annual production plan, we must continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously promote mass movements. At the same time, we must also pay attention to doing a good job in specific organizational and technical work. First, in terms of raw materials, materials, and fuel, we must try every means to ensure timely supply and maintain a certain amount of reserves. Second, in terms of equipment maintenance, we must do it in a planned and timely manner. We must pay attention to equipment maintenance at ordinary times, and repair it in time when it needs to be repaired, and never let small problems become big problems. Third, in terms of enterprise management, we must continue to promote the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." Leading cadres must go to the front line in person, mingle with the broad masses of workers, and grasp the solution of practical problems. We must not only encourage the masses of workers to boost their morale, but also pay attention to ensuring that the masses of workers have the necessary rest; we must not only grasp production, but also pay attention to the lives of the workers; we must not only pay attention to improving efficiency, but also pay attention to safe production. Only in this way can workers carry out production persistently and energetically. The work in these aspects, following the mass line, cadres taking the lead in participating in labor, ensuring the supply of materials, carrying out equipment maintenance in a timely manner, strengthening and improving management work, etc., are all necessary conditions to ensure that the surging mass movement continues to be consolidated and sustained. And following the mass line and cadres taking the lead in participating in labor are the two most basic ones. Leading comrades on the industrial and transportation fronts must adhere to these two. "Of all the plans, following the mass line is the first plan." "Of all the measures, cadres taking the lead in participating in labor is the first measure."

In order to implement the policy of taking both industry and agriculture together, industry in the future must support agriculture more and gradually equip the people's communes technically. At present, we should immediately grasp the production of agricultural machinery, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers.

In order to ensure a "good start" at the beginning of next year, we must earnestly, timely, and comprehensively arrange industrial production for the first quarter of next year in the fourth quarter of this year. We must start from now to not only grasp the current production, but also start preparing for production in the first quarter of next year. Before the production plan for next year is determined, first refer to the estimated completion of this year's production and specifically arrange the production for the first quarter. For certain products that are currently in short supply, we must take measures as soon as possible. We must start feeding materials for production as soon as possible for those that should be fed materials early; and we must repair the equipment that should be repaired before the end of the year. In short, we must do a good job in various production preparations before the end of the year in order to ensure that the production in the first quarter of next year is steadily improved on the level of the fourth quarter of this year.

After the efforts this year, especially since August and September, the material and technical conditions for the production and construction of industry and transportation have been better, the management level of enterprises has also been improved, the experience in leading mass movements has also been enriched, and the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses have been further improved. As long as we fully mobilize all workers and masses to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, and continue to carry forward the heroic and tenacious, bold innovation, and continuous revolution spirit of the working class, we will certainly be able to make the current production upsurge higher and higher, and we will definitely be able to complete this year's leap forward plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and prepare conditions for the continued great leap forward in the first quarter of next year.

    力争提前十天到十五天完成今年工业生产计划
    当前我们国家的经济形势怎么样？我们的回答是：很好，很好，很好！这样一个群众干劲冲天、生产蒸蒸日上的经济形势，意味着1959年的国民经济计划不仅将要胜利完成，并且可以提前和超额完成。今年我国国民经济有可能在去年大跃进的基础上实现继续大跃进。
    当前工业战线形势的最主要的特点是生产迅速地全面地增长。8、9两月的生产是直线上升的。8月份的工业总产值比7月份增长了14％，9月份的工业总产值又比8月份增长了27％左右。钢产量8月份比7月份增长了13.5％，9月份又比8月份增长20％。煤产量8月份比7月份增长了11.5％，9月份又比8月份增长18％。1月到9月合计，工业总产值比去年同期增长45.5％，钢产量增长67％，煤产量增长72％。钢、生铁、发电量、金属切削机床、原油、水轮机及汽轮机、动力机械、拖拉机、联合收割机等主要产品今年1至9月的产量，已经超过大跃进的1958年全年的产量，石油、化工产品、建筑材料以及其他工业产品都有了很大的增长。这九个月中，全国的货运量比去年同期增长69％，商品收购额比去年同期增长42％，商品零售额比去年同期增长16％，9月底商品库存比去年同期增长22％，市场上一派繁荣的景象。今年年初曾经出现的一小部分商品的供应有些不足的情况已经有了根本好转。
    这样一个极为良好的经济形势，是在去年以来大跃进的基础上形成的；党中央8月初关于反右倾，鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的指示，对于整个经济形势起了决定性的影响。几乎在几天的时间内，“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召就成为广大群众的实际行动。广大群众行动起来以后，一开始就注意了多、快、好、省，注意了高产、优质、低耗、安全；行业与行业、企业与企业、车间与车间、小组与小组、同工种与同工种之间的对口竞赛以及上下工种“一条龙”竞赛迅速开展起来；大评比小评比、大交流小交流、大参观小参观、大协作小协作也进行得很热烈。这就使得这一次增产节约运动发展得很全面、很健康，因而能够极其迅速地收到实效，造成了极为良好的经济形势。八届八中全会以前，我国的经济形势虽然也是良好的，每个月的工业总产值都比去年同期有很大的增长，但是由于当中出现了一阵右倾小台风，有部分产品6、7月份的产量下降，形成了一个“小小的马鞍形”。党的八届八中全会的“反右倾、鼓干劲”的号召下达以后，形势立即迅速好转，这又一次证明了“气可鼓而不可泄”的真理，证明了社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的，证明了必须反透右倾，鼓足干劲，高举社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，才能实现国民经济高速度的发展。
    目前，这个波澜壮阔的增产节约运动还在继续发展，生产潜力仍然很大。摆在我们面前的任务是：继续彻底揭发和批判右倾思想和右倾活动，彻底克服右倾松劲现象和空喊困难、不抓紧解决实际问题的空谈作风，切实鼓足干劲，千方百计地采取有效措施，把目前正在开展的高涨的群众性增产节约运动巩固起来，持续不断地发展下去，争取提前十天到十五天全面完成今年的生产计划，并且在今年第四季度就把明年的生产和建设任务安排好。这是一个伟大的任务。提前十天到十五天全面完成全年的生产计划，并且在今年第四季度就把明年的生产和建设任务安排好，不仅将使八届八中全会提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召提前实现，不仅将为明年和今后的大跃进创造良好的条件；而且将使我们赢得时间，能够把明年第一季度的生产准备工作做得更好，争取明年“开门红”，使第一季度至少保持并力争超过今年第四季度的生产水平，为1960年的大跃进打下基础。有了1958年到1960年三年大跃进的基础，我们就可以争取用比十年更短的时间在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国。
    为了把今年第四季度的任务完成得更好，使全年的生产计划提前和超额完成，各个战线上的职工都要继续不懈地努力，使各种产品的产量稳定地上升。这种稳定地上升，是要以旬计算的。这就是说，我们不只是要求这个季度的生产高过上个季度的生产，这一个月的生产高过上一个月的生产，还要求这一旬的生产高过上一旬的生产，要巩固现有的成就，永远消灭过去月初的生产水平总要比上月末下降的马鞍形。这种马鞍形，过去经常在许多企业里反复出现，似乎已经成为一种“常规”。许多人把它看作是生产发展中不可避免的“客观规律”，似乎是不能改变的，因而不自觉地放松斗志，本来有可能争取月初、年初的生产水平不下降，并且在上月末、上年末水平的基础上稳定提高的，也不积极争取了。马鞍形是不是真是一种不可避免的“规律”呢？8、9两月的生产实绩证明，完全不是这样，相反，这是一种人为的因素造成的。是由于原材料的供应工作没有组织好，或者由于月末、年末突击生产，没有及时检修设备，没有很好地安排工人的劳动和休息所造成的。这些都是人为的因素，并非客观规律，这种“常规”是完全可以改变的。事实上，很多企业早就打破了这种“常规”。在这些企业里，不论是年初或者月初，生产都是从一个高峰到另一个高峰，直线上升，或者至少稳定在上年末、上月末的水平，根本没有下降。更有力的证明是今年8月和9月，又有更多的企业普遍打破了这种“常规”，许多重要产品的生产在全国范围内消灭了马鞍形。例如钢和生铁，过去月初的日产量总比上月下旬下降7％—8％，而9月上旬却分别比8月下旬提高8％—11％。我们能够在8、9月份做到的，在10、11、12月也一定能够做到。事实上国庆节后的几天中，许多企业的职工已经实现了自己提出的“节后开门红”的诺言。我们要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，抓紧解决实际问题，建立一种稳定地上升的新的真正的生产常规，保证10月初的生产在上月末的水平上稳定提高，保证11月初的生产在10月末的水平上稳定提高，保证12月初的生产又在11月末的水平上稳定提高，保证明年1月初的生产又在今年12月末的水平上稳定提高。
    我们不但要创造月初、年初生产稳定上升的新常规，还要建立产量、质量、成本和安全工作全面跃进的新常规。多快好省本来互相连系着的，多快必须是又好又省的多快，好省必须是又多又快的好省，它们彼此是不容分割的。但是，过去有不少同志认为只能在某一个或两个方面跃进，不能在提高产量的同时，提高质量，降低成本。有些同志并且认为这也是一种“不以人们的意志为转移的规律”。其实，这并不是客观规律，而是完全可以改变的。这种“常规”也已经在8、9月被普遍打破了。8、9两个月，无论是钢、铁、煤等原料生产，还是机械等加工工业的生产，不但是产量逐旬逐月提高，质量也逐旬逐月提高，成本也逐旬逐月降低，生产也很安全，设备事故和人身事故比已往任何时候都少。我们既然能够在8、9月份做到多快好省并且安全地有劳有逸地全面跃进，在今后也一定能够做到，而且必须做到。
    为了促进生产高潮的进一步发展，保证生产高潮能够稳定和持续下去，全面地超额完成今年的生产计划，必须继续反右倾、鼓干劲、大搞群众运动，同时还要注意做好具体的组织工作和技术工作。第一，在原料、材料、燃料的方面，要想尽一切办法保证及时供应，并且要做到有一定的储备。第二，在设备维修方面，要做到有计划地及时地进行。平时要注意设备维护，需要检修的一定及时检修，决不让小毛病变成大毛病。第三，在企业管理方面，要继续推行“两参一改三结合”的经验，领导干部一定要亲临前线，同广大职工打成一片，抓紧解决实际问题；既要职工群众鼓足干劲，又要注意使职工群众有必要的休息；既抓生产，又注意职工生活；既注意提高效率，又注意安全生产。这样才能使职工持久地精力充沛地进行生产。这几个方面的工作，走群众路线，干部带头参加劳动，保证物资供应，及时进行设备检修，加强和改进管理工作，等等，都是保证高涨着的群众运动继续巩固和持续下去的必要条件。而走群众路线和干部带头参加劳动更是最基本的两条。工业交通战线上的领导同志们，必须坚持这两条。“千计万计，走群众路线是第一计”。“千条万条，干部带头参加劳动是第一条”。
    为了贯彻执行工农业并举的方针，今后的工业要更多地支援农业，逐步把人民公社从技术上装备起来。目前即应立即抓紧农业机械、农药和化学肥料的生产。
    为了保证明年年初“开门红”，必须认真地在今年第四季度及时地全面地安排明年第一季度的工业生产。要从现在起就一面抓紧当前的生产，一面着手为明年第一季度的生产做好准备工作。在明年生产计划尚未确定之前，先参照今年的生产预计完成情况，具体安排第一季度的生产。对于某些目前供不应求的产品，要及早采取措施，该及早投料生产的一定要及早投料；该检修的设备一定要在年前修好。总之，一定在年前做好各项生产准备工作，才能保证明年第一季度的生产在今年第四季的水平上稳定提高。
    经过今年以来的努力，特别是8、9两个月以来的努力，工业、交通运输业的生产和建设的物质技术条件更好了，企业的管理水平也提高了，领导群众运动的经验也更加丰富了，广大群众的政治觉悟和劳动热情更加提高了。只要我们充分发动全体职工群众继续反右倾，鼓干劲，继续发扬工人阶级的英勇顽强、大胆革新、不断革命的精神，一定能够使目前的生产高潮一浪高过一浪，一定能提前十天到十五天全面完成今年的跃进计划，并且为明年第一季度的继续大跃进准备好条件。
