Provincial Committee Tightens Grip, Cadres Go Deep into Grassroots, Masses are High in Fighting Spirit
Guizhou Completes Annual Steel Production Task Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Dispatch) The heroes on the steel front in Guizhou Province proposed in early September to complete the province's annual steelmaking task two and a half months ahead of schedule. Now, they have realized this ambitious goal. As of noon on September 25th, the province had exceeded the annual steel production task of 30,000 tons by more than 28 tons, completing the leap forward plan twenty days and twelve hours ahead of schedule. Steelmaking workers have proposed a new goal: to produce another 12,000 tons of steel for the country in the last three months.

    Guizhou Province's steel industry developed during the Great Leap Forward last year. Before last year, the province had never produced a single catty of foreign steel. From the beginning of this year, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strengthened its leadership over steel production. In order to rapidly increase steel production and normalize production, the Provincial Committee started with equipment matching in the first quarter, mobilizing machinery factories and foundries to produce necessary equipment, and mobilizing steelmaking units to conduct detailed research on transportation and equipment layout within the factory, and made timely adjustments and improvements. Relevant departments also organized short-term training classes for steelmaking workers and technicians, training a group of technical forces for each unit. As a result, the province's steel production quickly became normal, and output rose steadily. In the second quarter, the province's steel output increased by 122% compared with the first quarter. The converter utilization coefficient also gradually increased.

    After the steel output increased, the Provincial Committee immediately issued a new call to steelmaking workers throughout the province, requiring all units to pay attention to improving steel quality while grasping the increase in steel output. From May, steelmaking workers throughout the province launched a campaign to conquer high sulfur and seize high quality. With the help of the metallurgical department, all units quickly carried out raw material fixed-point, established testing and batching systems, formulated technical operating procedures, strengthened scheduling, and further carried out technical innovation activities. In the technical innovation movement, many units promoted hot-blast alkaline iron-making furnaces and alkaline converters. Steel quality rapidly improved. In June, the pass rate of steel calculated according to one element rose to 76.18%; by July, calculated according to three elements of sulfur, phosphorus, and carbon, the pass rate of steel reached 76.75%, a great improvement compared to before.

    Entering August, all units conscientiously summarized the production before July, criticized the right-leaning emotions of a few cadres, and further launched a socialist labor competition of high quality, high yield, and low cost between factories, between shifts, between furnaces, and between people. The average daily steel output in July was only about 130 tons, while the average daily output in August reached more than 150 tons; calculated according to the three elements of sulfur, phosphorus, and carbon, the average quality of steel in August reached 88.24%, an increase of 15% compared to July.

    After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the labor enthusiasm of steelmaking workers became even higher, and they made guarantees to respond to the Party's call with practical actions to complete the national plan two and a half months ahead of schedule. In order to achieve this heroic combat task, all units revised their leap forward plans and added measures. Party secretaries and factory directors of many factories personally went to the front line to direct production, and ate, lived, and labored with the workers. The average daily steel output in the first twenty days of September reached about 260 tons, an increase of more than 100 tons compared to the average daily output in August. On September 11th, steel output also broke through the 300-ton mark, creating the highest record since the province's steelmaking. The pass rate of steel calculated according to the five elements of sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, manganese, and carbon has averaged about 90%, basically meeting the requirements of the state.

    省委环环抓紧　干部深入基层　群众斗志昂扬
    贵州全年产钢任务提前完成
    本报讯　贵州省钢铁战线上的英雄们在9月初曾提出要提前两个半月完成全省全年的炼钢任务，现在，他们这一壮志豪语已经实现了。到9月25日中午，全省已超额二十八吨多比跃进计划提前二十天零十二小时完成了全年产钢三万吨的任务。炼钢职工又提出新的奋斗目标：在最后三个月中，再为国家生产一万二千吨钢。
    贵州省的钢铁工业是在去年大跃进中发展起来的。去年以前，这个省从来没有生产过一斤洋钢。今年从年初起，中共贵州省委就加强了对钢铁生产的领导。省委为了迅速提高钢的产量，并做到生产正常化，在第一季度从设备配套入手，一面发动各机械厂、翻砂厂生产必要的设备，一面发动炼钢单位的职工对厂内的运输、设备布局等问题进行了详细的研究，并及时加以调整和改进。有关部门还开办了炼钢工人和技术人员的短期训练班，为各单位培养了一批技术力量。这样一来，全省钢的生产迅速趋于正常，产量节节上升。第二季度全省钢产量就比第一季度增长了122％。转炉利用系数也逐渐提高。
    钢产量提高以后，省委立即向全省炼钢职工提出新的号召，要求各单位在抓紧提高钢产量的同时，注意提高钢的质量。从5月份起，全省炼钢职工开展了征服高硫夺取优质的运动。各单位在冶金部门的帮助下，迅速进行了原料定点，建立了化验、配料制度，制定了技术操作规程，加强了调度，并且进一步开展了技术革新运动。在技术革新运动中，许多单位都推广了热风碱性化铁炉和碱性转炉。钢的质量迅速上升。6月份钢的合格率按照一个元素计算，上升到76.18％；到7月份按硫、磷、碳三个元素计算，钢的合格率达到76.75％，比以前有很大提高。
    进入8月，各单位都认真总结了7月以前的生产，批判了少数干部的右倾情绪，进一步开展起厂与厂、班与班、炉与炉、人与人之间的优质、高产、低成本的社会主义劳动竞赛。7月份钢的平均日产量只有一百三十吨左右，8月份平均日产量达到一百五十吨以上；钢的质量按硫、磷、碳三个元素计算，8月份平均达到88.24％，比7月份提高了15％。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，炼钢工人们的劳动热情更加高涨，纷纷提出保证，要以提前两个半月完成国家计划的实际行动来响应党的号召。各单位为了实现这一豪迈的战斗任务，都修订了跃进计划，增加了措施。许多厂的党委书记、厂长都亲临前线指挥生产，并与工人同吃、同住、同劳动。9月头二十天钢的平均日产量达到二百六十吨左右，比8月份平均日产量增加了一百多吨。9月11日，钢的产量还突破三百吨大关，创造了全省炼钢以来的最高纪录。钢的合格率按硫、磷、釸、锰、碳五个元素计算，已平均达到90％左右，基本上符合国家的要求。
