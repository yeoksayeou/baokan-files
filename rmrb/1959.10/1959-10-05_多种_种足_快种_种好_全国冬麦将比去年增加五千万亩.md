Xinhua News Agency report: A vigorous high tide of autumn plowing and wheat planting is unfolding from north to south in China's winter wheat producing areas. Inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the autumn plowing and wheat planting armies of tens of thousands of people's communes across the country are in high spirits and full of energy. Whether in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, the Yellow River basin, the Yangtze River basin, or the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, one can see the moving scenes of them deploying their forces to launch surprise attacks on autumn plowing and wheat planting. The autumn plowing and wheat planting armies in various places have put forward resounding battle slogans: Plant more, plant sufficiently, plant quickly, plant well, and fire the first shot for a bumper harvest of winter wheat next year.

Various localities have strengthened the leadership of the Party and launched mass movements for autumn plowing and planting on a large scale. Many places have launched competitions between communes, teams, and individuals, vying with each other to be the best. In Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, 166 communes and more than 6,700 teams participated in the competition. The production teams of the Suhe People's Commune in Linyi City carried out counterpart competitions and leagues. By September 18, all 26,000 mu of early-cropped land in the commune had been plowed, of which 3,985 mu had been leveled and reached the standard of garden-like fields. The No. 11 People's Commune in Wenxian County, Gansu Province, carried out a four-comparison competition, comparing enthusiasm, indicators, measures, and actual results, and organized cooperation between production teams, which greatly promoted wheat planting work.

This year, various localities started autumn plowing and planting early and made rapid progress. The winter wheat sowing period has generally been advanced by seven to ten days. Now, the provinces in the Yellow River basin have entered the high tide of wheat planting, and northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu have also begun large-scale sowing. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of September 29, fourteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Yunnan, had cultivated more than 190 million mu of land in the autumn, and sown more than 69 million mu of winter wheat.

The people's communes in various places have paid close attention to the main measures for increasing production, such as timely sowing, rational close planting, deep plowing, fertilization, and good seeds. Therefore, the quality of winter wheat sowing is good. Most of the wheat fields are deeply plowed to a depth of six to seven inches, and some reach more than one foot. The base fertilizer is generally applied at about 5,000 jin per mu, and some reach more than 7,000 jin. Due to the water conservancy construction in various places, the irrigated area of ​​winter wheat fields this winter and next spring will be expanded by more than 15 million mu compared with last winter and this spring. In Hebei and Henan provinces, more than 70% of the wheat fields have sufficient irrigation conditions. The 460,000 mu of wheat that has been sown in Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, is generally sown with 20 to 25 jin per mu, of which 100,000 mu is sown with 25 to 30 jin. More than 80% of the more than one million mu of wheat sown in Jingchuan County, Gansu Province, is using improved varieties such as Bima No. 1, No. 4, and Zaoyang wheat; in terms of sowing methods, 70% is using drilling and 30% is using row sowing, eliminating broadcasting. This year, the six provinces of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu planted more than 200 million mu of wheat, of which the fallow area accounted for 22%, and the early stubble area accounted for 56%, and the stubble was also better than last year. As of September 20, more than 80% of the 4.25 million mu of wheat that had been sown in the five prefectures and cities of Liaocheng, Yantai, Zibo, Jining, and Qingdao in Shandong Province had reached the requirements of raised field and garden-like field status.

This year, in line with the principle of planting more to harvest more and achieving high yield and more harvests on some land, various localities have expanded the area of ​​wheat planting and planned large-scale high-yield fields. This year, the national winter wheat sowing plan is more than 360 million mu, an increase of more than 50 million mu over last year and more than 10 million mu over the year before last. Shandong and Anhui provinces have expanded by more than 10 million mu compared to last year, and Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces and autonomous regions have expanded by 1 million to 5 million mu. This year, sixteen counties including Yanshi, Mengxian, Xiangcheng, and Changyuan in Henan Province plan to expand the autumn planting area by 1.29 million mu compared to the summer harvest area this year. Various localities have generally selected wheat fields with better soil and water conservancy conditions to establish large-scale high-yield fields, set relatively high yield increase targets, and conscientiously and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, in order to drive the yield increase of general wheat fields. Provinces such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hebei all plan to cultivate large-scale high-yield fields on 20% to 30% of the sown area.

With the experience of the great leap forward in wheat production last year and this year, many people's communes in various places have made early and comprehensive preparations for wheat planting in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Planting more and planting well are the two primary keys to increasing wheat production. To this end, the central government and various provinces and regions made arrangements for expanding wheat planting as early as this summer, formulated plans for expanding wheat planting from top to bottom, and began preparations for seeds and fertilizers. This year, the preparations for wheat planting in various places are better than last year and the year before last. First of all, the seed preparation is relatively sufficient, generally prepared according to the sowing amount of about 20 jin per mu, and more than 90% are improved varieties. The base fertilizer for wheat (farm manure) is generally prepared at 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, which is also more than last year. Provinces such as Anhui and Shandong have prepared to eliminate wheat diseases and insect pests before sowing. Anhui Province requires all localities to seize the opportunity of autumn plowing and sowing, carry out seed treatment, and strive to eliminate diseases before the seeds are planted, and carry out the prevention and control of underground pests, in order to eliminate underground pests.

    多种　种足　快种　种好
    全国冬麦将比去年增加五千万亩
    据新华社讯　一个声势浩大的秋耕种麦运动高潮已在我国冬小麦产区由北而南蓬勃展开。在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，各地数以万计的人民公社的秋耕种麦大军意气风发，干劲冲天，不论在天山南北、黄河流域、长江流域，还是云贵高原，都可以看到他们摆开阵势突击秋耕种麦的动人场面。各地秋耕种麦大军提出了响亮的战斗口号：多种，种足，快种，种好，打响明年冬小麦大丰收的第一炮。
    各地加强了党的领导，大搞秋耕秋种群众运动。不少地方掀起了社与社、队与队、人与人之间的竞赛，你追我赶，齐争上游。山东临沂专区参加竞赛的有一百六十六个社、六千七百多个队。临沂市涑河人民公社各生产队之间开展了对口赛和联赛，到9月18日，全社二万六千多亩早茬地已全部翻完，其中有三千九百八十五亩经过平整，达到园田化。甘肃文县十一人民公社开展了比干劲、比指标、比措施、比实效的四比竞赛，并组织各生产队之间的协作，大大推动了种麦工作。
    今年各地秋耕秋种动手早，进度快，冬小麦播种期普遍提早了七天到十天。现在，黄河流域各省已进入种麦高潮，皖北和苏北也开始大规模播种。据农业部初步统计：到9月29日止，山西、陕西、甘肃、新疆、河北、山东、湖南、安徽、江苏、湖南、云南等十四个省、市和自治区，秋耕面积已达一亿九千多万亩，播种冬小麦已达六千九百多万亩。
    各地人民公社对适时播种、合理密植、深耕、施肥、良种等主要增产措施抓得很紧，因而冬小麦播种质量好。麦地大部分深耕六寸到七寸，有的达到一尺以上，施底肥一般每亩五千斤左右，多的达七千斤以上。由于各地抓好水利建设，今冬麦田灌溉面积将比去冬今春麦田灌溉面积扩大一千五百多万亩。河北、河南两省70％以上的麦田有了充分的灌溉条件。河南开封专区已播的四十六万亩小麦，一般每亩播种二十斤到二十五斤，其中有十万亩为二十五斤到三十斤。甘肃泾川县已播的一百多万亩小麦，80％以上是用碧蚂一号、四号和早洋麦等良种；在播种方法上，70％是用耧播，30％用条播，消灭了撒播。河北、河南、江苏、山西、陕西、甘肃六省今年种麦两亿多亩，其中歇茬的面积占22％，早茬面积56％，茬口也比去年好。山东省到9月20日止，聊城、烟台、淄博、济宁、青岛五个专区和市已播的四百二十五万多亩小麦，80％以上达到畦田化和园田化的要求。
    今年各地本着多种多收和在部分土地上实现高产多收相结合的方针，扩大了种麦面积，规划了大面积丰产田。今年全国冬小麦播种计划为三亿六千多万亩，比去年扩大五千多万亩，比前年扩大一千多万亩。比去年扩大一千万亩以上的有山东、安徽两省，扩大一百万亩到五百万亩的有河南、陕西、山西、湖北、新疆、贵州、湖南、江苏、河北等省和自治区。河南偃市、孟县、襄城、长垣等十六个县今年计划秋种面积比今年夏收面积扩大了一百二十九万亩。各地普遍选择土壤和水利条件较好的麦田，建立了大面积丰产田，订出比较高的增产指标，认真全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，以带动一般麦田增产。山西、陕西、河南、河北等省，都计划在播种面积中搞20％到30％的大面积丰产田。
    有了去年和今年小麦生产大跃进的经验，各地许多人民公社都根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，及早地全面地进行了种麦准备工作。多种和种好是小麦增产的两个首要关键。为此，早在今年夏天中央和各省区就作了扩大种麦的安排，从上到下订了扩大种麦的计划，并且开始了对种子和肥料的准备工作。今年各地种麦的准备工作比去年和前年都好。首先是种子准备比较充足，一般都是按每亩播种量二十斤左右准备的，而且90％以上都是良种。种麦基肥（农家肥）一般是按每亩四、五千斤准备的，也较去年为多。安徽、山东等省都已准备把小麦的病虫害消灭在播种之前。安徽省要求各地抓紧秋耕播种时机，进行种子处理，力争在种子下地前消灭病害，进行地下害虫的防治，以消灭地下虫害。
