Shanxi Ushers in a High Tide of Diversified Economy
The total income of the communes' diversified economy has reached more than 300 million yuan, a sharp increase of more than two times over the same period last year.

    (Our report) People's communes in various parts of Shanxi Province have made full use of natural conditions, broken through regional boundaries, and concentrated manpower and funds, promoting the rapid development of diversified economy. Starting in the fourth quarter, a new upsurge in vigorously developing diversified economy has been launched.
    According to recent incomplete statistics, the total income of diversified economy in people's communes has reached more than 300 million yuan, an increase of more than two times over the same period last year, with an average income of more than 20 yuan per person, exceeding any year in history. With the increase in income, in addition to a large increase in public accumulation, more and more members have savings. According to a survey of 78 management areas in Pingshun County in the Taihang Mountains: among 12,682 households, every household has savings, totaling more than 495,000 yuan, with an average savings of more than 39 yuan per household. The phenomenon of unbalanced economic development between many management areas and production teams has also gradually been eliminated. In Changzhi Prefecture, 800 poor management areas have vigorously developed diversified economy in the past six months, and the total income has increased by about 100% over the same period last year. The management area with the lowest income has also caught up with the income level of the wealthy management areas.
    Mountainous areas account for about 70% of the total area of Shanxi Province. "Inexhaustible underground treasures, wealth everywhere on the ground," there are good conditions for vigorously developing diversified economy. During the period of agricultural production cooperatives, due to the limitations of small agricultural cooperatives and insufficient manpower and financial resources, areas with abundant resources lacked labor and funds, while areas with more labor and funds lacked resources, which affected the high-speed development of diversified economy. After communization, the people's communes had superior conditions such as large scale, large population, abundant funds, and perfect equipment, and implemented unified planning, unified leadership, and unified arrangements, breaking through the past difficulties, developing diversified economy according to local conditions, and the degree of activity in sideline production greatly exceeded that of previous years.
    People's communes in various places have generally extracted about 30% of the labor force to form professional teams, taking the method of small-scale farming during busy farming seasons and large-scale farming during slack farming seasons to carry out diversified economy without affecting agricultural overproduction. Under the unified leadership of the communes, they broke through regional boundaries, lived off the mountains and lived off the water, and made unified plans for the local resources that could be utilized. The management areas cooperated with each other to vigorously develop diversified economy. The people's communes in the mountainous areas of Taihang, Taiyue, and Lüliang and the plains of Jinzhong and Jinnan, on the one hand, organized members to go up the mountains to hunt and collect wild plants and local products, and on the other hand, used various resources to run a large number of small processing plants and workshops, and vigorously raised poultry and livestock, achieving "everyone does their best, everything is used to its full potential, four roads to wealth, eight roads to treasure." More than 50,000 members from Fanshi, Wuzhai, and Zuoyun counties formed a professional army to collect wild plants. They set up camps on the mountains and launched a blitz of large-scale collection and processing, collecting more than 21.14 million catties of medicinal materials, mountain peaches, mountain apricots, oilseeds, and feed in more than ten days. After more than 200 agricultural cooperatives in Heshun County jointly built eight people's communes, the income from timber and fruits from January to August this year increased by 2.3 times over the same period last year, sheep increased by 28%, pigs increased by 1.04 times, and chickens increased by 2.8 times. On average, each farmer in the county has one pig, four sheep, and nine chickens. The total income of diversified economy reached more than 1.9 million yuan, an increase of 2.7 times over the same period last year, with an average income of more than 24 yuan per person.
    People's communes in various places have made full use of their strong funds to newly establish a large number of small factories and workshops. In the past six months, Chishiqiao People's Commune in Qin County has directly operated and jointly operated by management areas or independently operated various wineries, sugar factories, oil presses, and small factories such as lime kilns, weaving, rabbit raising, and beekeeping, totaling more than 50. The income from these production projects alone allows each member to receive an average of more than 110 yuan.
    The people's communes have also specifically studied and stipulated the authority of the commune, management area, production team, and individual members to operate sideline production, the hierarchical management methods, and the reasonable remuneration system, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to develop diversified economy.
    Recently, after studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, the members of the people's communes in various places have further recognized the superior conditions of the people's communes suitable for developing diversified economy, and have revised their targets, opened up new production avenues, deployed troops and generals, and fought hard in the fourth quarter to strive for more income. The people's communes in Jinbei Prefecture have also organized an army of thousands of troops to collect wild plants, and they have gone up the mountains to carry out a blitz of large-scale collection, large-scale processing, and large-scale procurement, determined to fight hard for 20 days, striving to achieve an average sideline income of 30 to 50 yuan per person in the entire region; by the end of this year, strive to reach one million pigs, 2.9 million sheep, and 4 million poultry. The communes in Licheng County have revised the annual sideline income plan from the original 3 million yuan to 4.5 million yuan, and the management areas have launched a competition upsurge, determined to increase the income of each member of the 70 poor management areas to more than 40 yuan, catching up with the wealthy areas.

    今冬明春　人人动手　四路进财　八路进宝
    山西涌起多种经营高潮
    公社多种经营总收入已达三亿多元，比去年同期猛增二倍多
    本报讯　山西省各地人民公社充分利用自然条件，打破地域界限，集中使用人力和资金，促进了多种经营飞跃发展，第四季度开始，又掀起大搞多种经营的高潮。
    据最近不完全统计，目前各地人民公社多种经营的总收入已达到三亿多元，比去年同期增加二倍多，每人平均收入二十多元，超过了历史上任何一年。随着收入的增加，除了公共积累大量增多外，存款的社员越来越多。据太行山区的平顺县七十八个管理区的调查：在一万二千六百八十二户社员中，户户存款，共达四十九万五千多元，平均每户存款达三十九元多。在许多管理区、生产队之间，经济发展不平衡的现象，也逐渐消除。长治专区八百个穷管理区，半年多来大搞多种经营，总收入比去年同期增加了一倍左右，收入最低的管理区也赶上了富裕管理区的收入水平。
    山西省山区面积约占总面积的70％，“地下宝藏取不尽，地上财源到处有”，有大搞多种经营的良好条件。在农业生产合作社时期，因受农业社规模小、人力财力不足等条件的限制，资源丰富的地区缺乏劳力和资金，而劳力和资金多的地区缺少资源，影响了多种经营不能高速度发展。公社化以后，人民公社具备了规模大、人多、资金雄厚、设备完善等优越条件，并实行了统一规划、统一领导、统一安排，冲破了过去的困难，因地制宜地发展了多种经营，副业生产活跃程度大大超过了往年。
    各地人民公社，在不影响农业超产的情况下，一般都抽出了30％左右的劳力，组成专业队，采取农忙小搞、农闲大搞的方法，开展多种经营。他们在公社的统一领导下，打破了地域界限，靠山吃山，靠水吃水，把当地可以利用的资源进行了统一规划，各管理区分工协作大力发展多种经营。太行、太岳、吕梁等山区和晋中、晋南平原地区的各人民公社，一方面组织社员上山打猎，采集野生植物和土特产品，一方面利用各种资源举办了大批小型加工厂和作坊，并大力饲养家禽家畜，做到了“人尽其才，物尽其用，四路进财，八路进宝”。繁峙、五寨、左云三县五万多名社员组成的采集野生植物的专业大军，在山上安营扎寨，展开了大采集、大加工的突击活动，十多天中采集药材、山桃、山杏、油料和饲料二千一百一十四万多斤。资源丰富的和顺县的二百多个农业社联合建成了八个人民公社以后，今年1至8月份，林木、果品的收入比去年同期增加了二点三倍，羊增加了28％，猪增加了一点零四倍，鸡增加了二点八倍。全县每户农民平均有一口猪、四只羊、九只鸡。多种经营的总收入达一百九十多万元，比去年同期增加了二点七倍，每人平均收入二十四元多。
    各地人民公社充分利用雄厚的资金，新举办了大批小型工厂和作坊。半年多来，沁县赤石桥人民公社直接经营和管理区联合经营或单独经营的各种酿酒、造糖、榨油作坊和烧石灰、编造、养兔、养蜂等小型工厂共有五十多个。仅这些生产项目的收入，使每户社员平均可得一百一十多元。
    各人民公社还具体研究规定了公社、管理区、生产队和社员个人经营副业生产的权限和分级管理办法，以及合理的报酬制度，大大激发了群众发展多种经营的积极性。
    最近，各地人民公社社员在学习了八中全会的决议以后，更进一步认清了人民公社适宜发展多种经营的优越条件，纷纷修订指标，开辟新的生产门路，调兵遣将，大战第四季度，争取增加更多的收入。晋北专区的各人民公社又组织起一支千军万马采集野生植物的大军，纷纷上山，开展了大采集、大加工、大收购的突击活动，决心苦战二十天，力争全区每人平均副业收入达到三十元到五十元；到今年年底，争取猪达到一百万头，羊达到二百九十万只，家禽达到四百万只。黎城县各公社把全年副业收入的计划由原来的三百万元修订为四百五十万元，各管理区掀起竞赛热潮，决心把七十个穷管理区社员每人收入提高到四十元以上，赶上富区。
