Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 20th (TASS): The following is the full text of the speech by Kuznetsov, Head of the Soviet Delegation, on the so-called "Tibetan Question" at the 20th Plenary Meeting of the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly today:

Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:

First of all, I cannot but express my regret that the General Assembly is being forced to discuss the non-existent "Tibetan Question." Like most delegations, we would have preferred to study truly important issues aimed at strengthening peace and developing cooperation between countries, rather than being diverted to discussing issues aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere and damaging the prestige of the United Nations. The General Assembly should have taken advantage of the recent warming in the international atmosphere to strengthen its role in the struggle to safeguard universal peace. In this regard, it should be recalled that the visit of Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev to the United States, his talks with US President Eisenhower, and the joint communique issued after the talks were welcomed by the whole world, and the visit was regarded as an important step on the road to improving relations between countries and easing international tensions. As a result, a promising prospect emerged of ending the "Cold War" and guiding international affairs onto a sensible path of peaceful cooperation between countries, in the interests of maintaining peace and promoting the progress of all mankind.

However, this development of international relations is clearly not to the taste of those who are unwilling to ease international tensions. They are attempting to create acute situations in international relations and to complicate the situation in the United Nations.

	Tibet was, is, and will remain an integral part of China
Those who raise the "Tibetan Question" in the United Nations pretend that discussing this question in the United Nations is not a crude and impermissible interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. Some people openly and directly doubt the indisputable truth that Tibet is an integral part of China, while others play tricks while doing so. We might as well recall some historical facts.

Everyone knows that close ties of friendship have linked Tibet with China since ancient times. In the 13th century, Tibet was officially included in the territory of China. Since then, the political system of Tibet, including the titles, status and functions of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, has always been determined by the central government of China. Tibet was, is, and will remain a part of China, an administrative region.

In history, imperialist forces have repeatedly attempted to separate Tibet from China through direct armed intervention and by instigating their lackeys to create "Tibetan independence." In this regard, the reactionary upper strata of feudal Tibet acted as tools in the hands of the colonialists.

As the Panchen Erdeni said in April this year, what the traitors of the Tibetan people actually need is not so-called "Tibetan independence," they are merely trying to betray the motherland in the name of "independence" in order to achieve their selfish goals and maintain their reactionary rule. This so-called banner of "independence" is exactly the same as the banner of "independence" flaunted by Pu Yi, the traitor of the Manchu people who sold himself to the Japanese aggressors and proclaimed the "Manchukuo." Even when China's strength was paralyzed by warlord infighting and direct imperialist aggression, the imperialist groups' conspiracy to declare Tibet "independent" failed. Any attempt to separate Tibet from the People's Republic of China is doomed to failure.

Under the new historical conditions, it has been very clearly reaffirmed that Tibet is an integral part of China. On May 23, 1951, the Central People's Government of China and the Local Government of Tibet signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which defined the status of Tibet as an autonomous region within the unified Chinese family. The basic principles of national policy, in particular the principle of guaranteeing regional autonomy, are expressly stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and other representatives of Tibet all participated in the drafting and adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954.

	Placing the so-called "Tibetan Question" on the agenda is a
crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China
From this it can be seen that placing the so-called "Tibetan Question" on the agenda of this session is undoubtedly a crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, and therefore an illegal step that violates the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

Those who slander the People's Republic of China feel guilty and have no legal basis at all, so they try to masquerade as humanitarian enthusiasts. Listening to the speeches of some representatives, it seems as if the Tibetan people themselves are at odds with themselves, and are unwilling to change the barbaric serf system under any circumstances, and that the spirit of the Declaration of Human Rights has been observed in Tibet in the past. Of course, this has nothing to do with the truth.

In this regard, it may be useful to cite some well-known facts that can clarify the truth. Until recently, the Tibetan people had been living a life of darkness, and its social system was more barbaric and cruel than the darkest Middle Ages. All the land, forests, ponds, pastures and other land were in the hands of a small number of feudal lords, both monks and laymen. It was these few people – about 5% of the population – who controlled all the affairs of Tibet; and the vast majority of the population – farmers and herdsmen – were serfs, and until recently, tens of thousands of people were completely enslaved. As soon as the master called, the serfs had to work for the master indefinitely at any time. The time they worked for the feudal lords' land without compensation every year accounted for two-thirds or even three-quarters of their total time. In addition, they had to do all kinds of corvée labor for the feudal government, monasteries, and serf owners. Even those who cannot be suspected of sympathizing with the Chinese people admit to these facts.

The American journalist Thomas, who is known for his active participation in subversive anti-China activities, wrote after visiting Lhasa: "In Tibet, the nobility has almost become a separate race. A deep gulf separates them from the peasants, herdsmen, and other people of ordinary origin... The peasants are bound to the land of the manor, just like the peasants in feudal Europe were bound to the land. They perform corvée labor and pay tribute in kind and money."

The British Tibetologist MacDonald wrote in his book "The Land of the Lamas" on this point: "The status of peasants in large manors is slightly better than that of slaves. They are forced to work a certain number of days a month for their masters and hand over most of the grain they harvest to their masters as tribute. They spend a lot of effort cultivating their small piece of land, and the grain they harvest is barely enough for their family to make a living and survive."

Serf owners have unlimited "judicial power"; they have the right to impose any punishment on serfs, including imprisonment and the most cruel torture. Serf owners can beat serfs arbitrarily, cut off their hands and feet, and incidents of killing serfs are also common.

Let's cite a few things that happened not long ago. In 1951, in Donggarzong (near Lhasa), a serf owner demanded grain that would not be enough to harvest in several years in order to have the serf Jiangcun repay a little debt. Jiangcun was forced to flee elsewhere, and as a result, the landlord executed his wife and forced his seven-year-old son to be his slave. This child was only recently freed. For example, Pala Tudeng Weideng, one of the leaders of the rebel group, had more than 3,000 serfs and slaves. Pala's house was equipped with prisons, instruments of torture, and even tools for gouging out eyes and cutting off noses. Once, a serf named Akan talked to a serf about the issue of reform, and as a result, Pala ordered the arrest of this serf, but he could not find him.

When Akan's brother was imprisoned and beaten to death, Akan appealed to the former Tibetan local government, but the case was transferred to Pala for trial. Pala threw Akan into prison, and Akan was whipped every night until he was beaten to death. In the past, such tragedies were everywhere in Tibet.

In short, the residents of Tibet did not know what personal freedom was at all, and feudal serf owners and their servants harmed serfs as they pleased. As you can see, this is the so-called "historically formed way of life." In order to maintain this "way of life," the reactionary upper strata tried their best to prevent its change. Under the instigation of external forces, they attempted to use force against their own people and the Central People's Government.

After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the working people of Tibet began to awaken. They saw the prospect of getting rid of unimaginable exploitation and the cruel oppression of serf owners, and the possibility of finally enjoying human rights and demanding humane treatment. As the Panchen Erdeni said in his report last week, the Tibetan working people understood that "the root cause of their poverty is not their bad fate, but the bad old system of Tibet, and the cruel oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class."

	Colonialists have always used the most brutal and inhumane means to deal with
the national liberation movement of the colonial people, and what they shed on the "Tibetan Question"
are just crocodile tears
Some people shed tears for the violation of human rights in Tibet, and strangely, the representatives of some countries, which are known far and wide as the planners of the most reactionary regimes and the main pillars of the increasingly disintegrating colonial system, are acting as the conductors of this mourning band. They talk a lot about human rights, which are just crocodile tears of the colonialists. For centuries, they have brutally massacred the people of Asia and Africa who were enslaved by them, and even now they still use the most brutal and inhumane means to deal with the national liberation movements in their colonies. In the general debate of this session, representatives of Asian and African countries cited vivid and clear examples in this regard. For example, the world public is shocked by the brutal suppression carried out by the colonialists in Oman, Kenya, the Belgian Congo, and many other regions. Human rights are trampled on in these areas, and people are deprived of the most basic freedoms. Is it not clear that the colonialists talk a lot about human rights when discussing this issue in order to maintain the privileges of the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, that is, to maintain the feudal serf system there? At the same time, they want to prevent democratic reforms in Tibet, because as a result of democratic reforms, the Tibetan people can gain true freedom and true human rights for the first time.

The argument that China "destroyed Tibet's religious and cultural autonomy" is obviously fabricated. These slanders are also built on sand. They are contrary to the facts. In fact, the Chinese government strictly respects the religious beliefs, customs and habits of the Tibetan people. Apa Apei Awang Jinmei, who served in the former Tibetan local government for more than ten years, recently stated on this issue that "... the People's Liberation Army and staff members stationed in Tibet by the Central Government have always implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief in Tibet, and have not committed any offenses against any temples."

The Panchen Erdeni pointed out on April 22 this year that "for eight years, the religious system and religious beliefs in Tibet have not changed. This is a fact that is obvious to all monks and lay people in Tibet. In fact, it is not the People's Liberation Army that destroys religion, but the rebels and reactionaries in Tibet. They kill and insult monks and nuns, desecrate Buddhist statues, rob sacrificial objects, and even use temples as strongholds for rebellion. Obviously, this is not a good deed to respect religion, but an evil deed to destroy religion."

From these authoritative talks, it can be seen that only the criminal acts of reactionaries have caused a threat to certain temples. It was the reactionaries who forced the monks to take up arms in violation of Buddhist beliefs in order to maintain the serf system. They did not hesitate to take extreme measures, even slaughtering those who refused to obey them. As many religious figures in Tibet emphasized, the Chinese authorities have been protecting temples and cultural and historical sites even in the process of suppressing the rebellion.

It must be pointed out that there is complete freedom of religious belief in China. Many people who have visited China and are concerned about this situation are convinced of this. For example, U Nu, who has visited China more than once, said at a press conference in New York on April 14, 1959, that there is freedom of religious belief in Tibet, and China has greater freedom of religious belief in the communist era than under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. The Vice President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists of Nepal, Amritananda, who visited China in the summer of 1959, said: "During my visit to China this time, I not only saw the rapid improvement of industry and agriculture, but also saw that China has true freedom of religious belief."

	Those who clamor about the "Tibetan Question" are not interested in the real facts at all.
They are just repeating unfounded slanders
However, those who clamor about the "Tibetan Question" are not interested in the real facts at all. In order to make absurd slanders against the People's Republic of China, these people do not hesitate to shamelessly distort and fabricate facts about the situation in a region of China. Representatives of some countries are repeating unfounded and sometimes even ridiculous slanders. Most of the facts they cite are malicious rumors and absurd fabrications by certain reactionary exiles in Tibet, as well as false materials concocted by those who clamor about the "Tibetan Question."

In this regard, it must be noted that some representatives are trying to justify their "accusations" based on the materials of the so-called "International Commission of Jurists." Everyone knows that the establishment of this commission is for the purpose of the "Cold War." All of its activities so far have been for only one purpose – to distort and spread rumors about socialist countries. The commission also compiled materials on the Tibetan issue in the same way. To illustrate how much its investigation is worth, I would like to mention a so-called "discovery" by Mr. Trirkundas, an active member of this "commission." On June 6 this year, the New York Times quoted Mr. Trirkundas as saying that all the Dalai Lama's palaces in Lhasa were destroyed by Chinese artillery. In fact, the editors of the New York Times could easily see the falsity of this lie, because the Potala Palace is still intact. Those who are good at slandering the Chinese people obviously act according to the principle that the more lies the better.

In view of the fact that people who are hostile to China have spread many lies about Tibet, it is also necessary to talk about other aspects of Tibetan life.

	The government of the People's Republic of China has done a lot of work to develop the economy and culture of the Tibet region.
In order to develop the economy and culture of this region and to improve the material living standards of the Tibetan residents, the government of the People's Republic of China has done a lot of work. Road construction was carried out. In addition to repairing the old roads, more than 7,000 kilometers of new roads have been built. In this way, it is possible to transport a large number of industrial products and other commodities that the people of the Tibet region need. The people's regime has reduced taxes, increased the purchase prices of wool and other local products, and issued huge amounts of interest-free loans and non-refundable loans to farmers. The first industrial enterprises in Tibet have been put into production. Many primary and secondary schools have been opened. Many medical and veterinary institutions have been established. The Tibetans have seen the bright prospects of a new and better life in all aspects.

At the same time, it must be emphasized that for the entire eight years, the government of the People's Republic of China, taking into account the special conditions of Tibet, has followed a cautious approach in implementing any measures there. In this regard, the Panchen Erdeni said on April 22, 1959: "In order to wait for the reactionaries to repent, the Central Government has repeatedly made concessions and done its utmost." However, the reactionaries in the feudal upper strata of Tibet were unwilling to realize local democratic autonomy, and they tried their best to obstruct the preparations for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

In particular, in March 1959, a small group of Tibetan reactionaries, who were linked to certain imperialist groups and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, instigated by foreign forces, perfidiously attempted to prevent the inevitable collapse of the Tibetan serf system by force of arms and妄想to separate Tibet from China. However, not only did the Tibetan people not follow the reactionaries, but they fully supported the government. Therefore, order was quickly restored and the residents were able to resume peaceful labor.

The armed rebellion launched by a part of the reactionary elements in the feudal upper strata of Tibet not only once again showed that they were the running dogs of foreign forces and enemies of national unity, but also exposed that they were the deadly enemies of the progress and prosperity of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people clearly saw the true colors of these reactionaries, so the Tibetan people were able to get rid of the shackles of serfdom and realize their long-cherished wish for democratic autonomy and social progress. Not only the peasants demanded these reforms, but also a large number of patriotic and progressive people among the middle and upper class residents demanded these reforms.

The democratic reforms that are now being carried out were started after long consultations with prominent figures in Tibet and with the full support of residents from all walks of life. These reforms are carried out by the Tibetans themselves (including the upper and middle class Tibetans). The Panchen Erdeni said, "When we implement reforms, we will follow a redemption policy, that is, a policy of implementing reforms for the upper class residents of Tibet in a peaceful way." In his report on October 14 this year, the Panchen Erdeni resolutely refuted the attempt of certain groups to slander the new life of the Tibetan people by using the United Nations, saying: "The Tibetan people will never change their direction of progress because of the clamor of imperialist elements... Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we must thoroughly destroy the cruel, barbaric, reactionary and backward feudal serf system..."

From the facts listed above, it can be seen very clearly how intolerable and harmful it is to discuss the "Tibetan Question" in the United Nations General Assembly under any pretext. Here I would like to quote a few words from the People's Daily. The People's Daily wrote when expressing the Chinese people's attitude towards foreign interference in China's internal affairs: "This does not allow any foreign country or the United Nations to interfere in any form or name. Therefore, any problem in Tibet can only be solved by China, solved in China, and cannot be solved in any foreign country." ("The Tibetan Revolution and Nehru's Philosophy" People's Daily, May 6, 1959 - Xinhua News Agency note)

	The people who raised the "Tibetan Question" are those who do not want to ease international tensions and stop the arms race.
What is the reason for once again instigating the United Nations General Assembly to violate the United Nations Charter and use the General Assembly to incite hostility and hatred towards the great Chinese people?

All this shows that what we are facing here is: some people are foolishly trying to bring the United Nations back to the dark days of the "Cold War." The masterminds of this trickery want to obstruct some positive and constructive efforts that have been made recently to improve international relations. The groups that do not want to ease tensions and stop the arms race are the people who planned to raise the "Tibetan Question" at this session. The delegations of Ireland and Malaya are merely the expressers of the will of these groups, and are playing the role of clowns in a farce directed by those who are keen to exacerbate international tensions.

The aggressive groups need to do this kind of trickery because they want to take the opportunity to strike at the cooperation between the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries, and to undermine the unity of the people of Asia and Africa in their struggle to strengthen national independence and strive for lasting peace. Some groups in the West are not reconciled to the collapse of their colonial rule, so they frantically take various means to curb the further development of the national liberation struggle of the people of all countries and hinder the people of all countries from handling affairs according to their own wishes.

The people of Asia and Africa have seen with their own eyes that in recent years, certain imperialist groups have been trying every possible means to intensify the tensions in Asia and the Far East; expand the war activities and sabotage activities of aggressive groups, and even extend these activities to neutral countries; obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Agreement on Indochina, and so on. The following facts can also prove this point: Although the Chinese People's Volunteers have long since completely withdrawn from North Korea, the US troops are still stationed in South Korea, Taiwan and other islands of China are still occupied, and are used to carry out aggressive activities against the Chinese people and maintain the tensions in the Far East. The South Vietnamese authorities, under foreign instigation, refused to fulfill the decision of the Geneva Conference on holding elections in North and South Vietnam. South Vietnam and Laos, Taiwan and South Korea are all used to create threats to the peace and security of Asian countries.

Some people are obviously deliberately arranging the current clamor about the "Tibetan Question" at such a time: at this time, the 650 million Chinese people and their friends all over the world are celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy. In these ten years, the People's Republic of China has made great achievements in developing the national economy and culture, and the international prestige of the People's Republic of China has been unprecedentedly enhanced.

There is no doubt that the new malicious attack on the People's China, like all the slanders in the past, cannot affect the Chinese people's advance towards socialist victory in the slightest, and cannot stop the continued consolidation of the international prestige of the People's Republic of China in the slightest.

	The Soviet delegation firmly opposes discussing the so-called "Tibetan Question."
The emergence of the so-called "Tibetan Question" in the United Nations also proves that some people are trying to divert the General Assembly's attention from the real international problems that need to be solved urgently. No wonder, recent newspapers have reported that some delegations want to use the "Tibetan Question" as an excuse to avoid serious cooperation on other issues on the agenda of this session.

The Soviet delegation believes that the good progress made in improving the international situation has created favorable conditions for representatives of all countries to carry out broad and realistic cooperation in the United Nations. The Soviet delegation has worked hard in the past and will continue to work hard in the future to cooperate with delegations of all countries to seek solutions to major international problems on the agenda of the session that are acceptable to all member states of the United Nations. We are willing to make every effort to make this session truly a session of peace and friendship between the people of all countries and to be recorded in the history of the United Nations. Any concrete steps taken by the delegations of all countries to improve international relations will be fully supported by the Soviet delegation.

However, we cannot support any steps that are not intended to improve international relations, but to intensify international relations. The conspiracy to raise the so-called "Tibetan Question" is this kind of step. We must never advocate improving relations on the one hand, and support discussing issues such as Tibet in the United Nations on the other, because this kind of issue will undoubtedly lead to the intensification of such relations.

Striving to ease tensions and not allowing issues in the United Nations that bring us back to the "Cold War" era is our common responsibility, and it is the responsibility of the delegations of all countries. In this case, the people of all countries will not complain that the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly is creating a new dangerous "Cold War" iceberg, which has now been pushed into a promising warm current.

The Soviet delegation firmly opposes discussing the so-called "Tibetan Question" in the United Nations. Of course, the Soviet delegation will vote against the proposals on Tibet put forward by Ireland and Malaya. Any proposal on this issue is illegal because it violates the provisions of the United Nations Charter that prohibit interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

The Soviet delegation is concerned about the United Nations fulfilling its responsibilities in resolving disarmament issues and other major issues aimed at improving the international situation, and therefore hopes that the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly will not embark on a path that harms the cause of peace and harms the existence of the United Nations itself.

    在第十四届联合国大会全体会议二十日会议上
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫的发言（全文）
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社纽约20日电：苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫今天在第十四届联合国大会全体会议上关于所谓“西藏问题”的发言，全文如下：
    主席先生：先生们：
    首先，我不能不对大会被强迫讨论并不存在的“西藏问题”这件事表示遗憾。同大多数代表团一样，我们本来是宁愿研究旨在加强和平与发展国与国之间的合作的真正重要问题的，而不愿意被转移视线，来讨论那些以毒化国际气氛和损害联合国威望为目的的问题。大会本来是应该利用国际气氛中最近出现的转暖来加强自己在维护普遍和平的斗争中的作用。在这方面，应该追述一下，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的访美、他同美国总统艾森豪威尔所进行的会谈以及在会谈后发表的联合公报受到了全世界的欢迎，人们把这次访问看作是改善国与国之间的关系和缓和国际紧张局势的道路上的重要步骤。结果出现了大有希望的远景，即结束“冷战”和把国际事务引到一条各国和平合作的明智途径上，以利于维护和平和促进全人类的进步。
    但是，国际关系的这种发展显然不合那些不愿意缓和国际紧张局势的人的口胃。他们企图在国际关系中引起尖锐的局势，在联合国使局面复杂化。
      西藏过去是、今后仍然是中国的不可分割的
  一个组成部分
    在联合国提出“西藏问题”的人装模作样，好像在联合国讨论这个问题不是对中华人民共和国内政的粗暴的、不能容许的干涉。有一些人直截了当地公然怀疑西藏是中国的不可分割的一部分这一不容争辩的真理，而另外一些人在这样做的时候则是玩弄了种种手腕。我们不妨追述若干历史事实。
    人人都很清楚，自古以来，紧密的友谊纽结就把西藏同中国联系在一起。在十三世纪，西藏正式列入中国版图。自那时以来，西藏的政治制度，包括达赖喇嘛和班禅喇嘛的封号、地位和职权就一向是由中国中央政府确定的。西藏过去是，今后仍然是中国的一个组成部分、一个行政区。
    在历史上，帝国主义势力曾经多次用直接武装干涉和策动他们的走狗制造“西藏独立”，企图使西藏脱离中国。在这方面，西藏封建上层反动集团作了殖民主义者手中的工具。
    正如班禅额尔德尼在今年4月间所说的，西藏人民的叛徒实际上所需要的并不是什么西藏的“独立”，他们只不过是企图假“独立”之名背叛祖国，以达到自私自利的目的和维护他们的反动统治而已。这块所谓“独立”的招牌同卖身投靠日本侵略者的满族人民的叛徒溥仪所标榜的“满洲国”“独立”的招牌是完全一模一样的。甚至当中国的力量由于军阀混战和帝国主义的直接侵略而陷于瘫痪的时候，帝国主义集团企图宣布西藏“独立”的阴谋也未能得逞。想使西藏脱离中华人民共和国的任何企图都肯定失败了。
    在新的历史条件下，曾经极其明确地从新肯定，西藏是中国的不可分割的一部分。1951年5月23日中国中央人民政府同西藏地方政府签订了和平解放西藏办法的协议，这项协议确定了西藏作为统一的中国大家庭内的一个自治区的地位。民族政策的基本原则、特别是保证区域自治的原则在中华人民共和国的宪法中有明文规定。大家知道，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏的其他代表都曾经参加了1954年中华人民共和国宪法的草拟和通过。
      把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程是对中华人民共
  和国内政的粗暴干涉
    由此可见，把所谓“西藏问题”列入本届会议议程，无疑的，是对中华人民共和国内政的粗暴干涉，因而也就是一个非法步骤，它破坏了联合国宪章的基本原则。
    诬蔑中华人民共和国的人感到自己理亏和完全没有法律根据，于是就企图冒充人道主义的热心家。在听一些代表发言时，使人觉得，好像西藏人民自己在与自己为敌，无论如何也不愿意改变野蛮的农奴制度，似乎在西藏过去遵守了人权宣言的精神。当然，这与真实情况毫无共同之点。
    在这方面，不妨援引一些众所周知的事实，这些事实可以澄清真象。直到不久之前为止，西藏人民一直过着暗无天日的生活，其社会制度比最黑暗的中世纪时代还要野蛮和残酷。所有的土地、森林、水池、牧场和其他土地都掌握在一小撮僧俗封建主的手中。正是这些少数人——约占居民的5％——掌管了西藏的全部事务；而绝大多数的居民——农民和牧民都是农奴，就在不久以前，还有数万人完全处于奴隶地位。只要主人一声呼唤，农奴们就必须随时无限地为主人工作。他们每年无偿地在封建主的土地上工作的时间要占自己全部时间的三分之二，甚至四分之三。此外，还要为封建政府、寺院和农奴主去做各种各样的徭役。对于这些事实，甚至那些绝不能怀疑他们同情中国人民的人也都承认。
    以积极参加颠覆性的反华活动而出名的美国记者托马斯在去过拉萨以后写道：“在西藏，贵族差不多成了一个单独的种族。一道深深的鸿沟把他们与农民、牧民和其他普通出身的人分隔开来……。农民被束缚在庄园的土地上，就像封建时代欧洲农民被束缚在土地上一样。他们服劳役，贡奉实物钱财”。
    英国的西藏学家麦克唐纳在他写的“喇嘛的国度”一书中对这一点写道：“农民在大庄园中的地位稍微比奴隶的地位好一点。他们被迫给自己的主人每月干一定天数的活，并把自己收获的大部分粮食作为贡物交给主人。他们费好大力气把自己的小得可怜的一片土地种上庄稼，而收得的粮食勉强够他们一家老小糊口，苟延残喘”。
    农奴主拥有无限的“审判权”；他们有权对农奴施加任何惩罚，其中包括监禁和最残暴的酷刑。农奴主可以任意毒打农奴，砍掉他们的手和脚，而打死农奴的事件也是屡见不鲜的。
    我们举几件不久以前发生的事。1951年，在东噶宗（拉萨附近），一个农奴主为了要农奴江村偿还一点点欠债，竟索要几年也收获不够的粮食。江村被迫逃亡别处，结果地主处死了他的妻子，迫使他七岁的儿子给自己当奴隶。这个孩子最近才获得了自由。又例如，叛乱集团头目之一帕拉·土登为登曾有三千多名农奴和奴隶。帕拉的家里设有监狱、备有刑具，甚至挖眼睛、割鼻子的工具等等。有一次，一个名叫阿堪的农奴同一个农奴谈了改革的问题，结果帕拉下令逮捕这个农奴，但是没有找到他。
    当阿堪的哥哥被关进监狱并被打死的时候，阿堪向前西藏地方政府申诉，但是，这件案子又被转交这个帕拉审理。帕拉把阿堪投入监狱，阿堪每夜受到鞭笞，直到被打死为止。过去，在整个西藏这种惨象到处皆是。
    总之，西藏居民根本不知道有什么人身自由，封建农奴主及其仆从们为所欲为地残害农奴。大家看，这就是所谓“历史上形成的生活方式”，为了保持这种“生活方式”，反动上层竭尽全力阻挠它的改变，他们在外力唆使下企图用武力反对自己的人民和中央人民政府。
    西藏和平解放之后，西藏的劳动人民开始觉醒了。他们看到了摆脱难以想像的剥削和农奴主残酷压迫的前景，看到了终于享有人权和要求人道待遇的可能性。正如班禅额尔德尼在上星期的报告中所说的，西藏劳动人民明白了，“他们贫穷的根源并不是自己的命运不好，而是西藏的旧制度不好，是反动的上层统治阶级残酷压迫、剥削的结果”。
      殖民主义者一贯用最残无人道的手段来对付
  殖民地人民的民族解放运动，他们在“西藏问题”
  上流的只不过是假眼泪而已
    有人为人权在西藏遭到破坏而流眼泪，而奇怪的是，充当这种哭丧乐团指挥的正是这样一些国家的代表，这些国家是以最反动政权的策划者和日益瓦解的殖民体系的主要支柱而远近闻名的。他们大谈特谈人权，这只不过是殖民主义者的假眼泪而已，他们几世纪以来残酷地屠杀被他们奴役的亚非各国人民，而直到目前仍然不惜使用最残无人道的手段来对付在他们殖民地上的民族解放运动。在本届会议的一般性辩论中，亚非各国代表在这一方面举出了生动显明的例子。例如，世界公众感到震惊的是，殖民主义者在阿曼、怯尼亚、比属刚果以及很多其他地区进行残酷的镇压。在这些地区人权遭到蹂躏，人们被剥夺了最起码的自由。殖民主义者在讨论这个问题时大谈特谈人权，这是为了千方百计地保持反动上层集团在西藏的特权，即保持那里的封建农奴制度，这难道不是很明白吗？同时，他们想阻挠在西藏进行民主改革，因为民主改革的结果，西藏人民就可以第一次获得真正的自由、真正的人权。
    诬蔑中国“破坏西藏的宗教和文化自治”，这种论调显然是?造的。这些诬蔑也是建筑在沙滩上的。它们与事实相违背。实际上，西藏人民的宗教信仰、风俗和习惯都受到中国政府严格的尊重。曾在旧西藏地方政府供职十余年的阿沛·阿旺晋美不久以前就这个问题声明说，……“中央派驻西藏的人民解放军和工作人员在西藏一贯实行宗教信仰自由政策，对任何寺庙都秋毫无犯”。
    班禅额尔德尼今年4月22日指出，“八年来，西藏的宗教制度和宗教信仰，都没有改变。这是全藏僧俗人民有目共睹的事实，实际上破坏宗教的不是人民解放军，而是西藏的那些叛乱分子和反动分子。他们杀害和污辱僧尼，玷污佛像，抢劫供奉器物，甚至把寺院作为叛乱的据点。显然这不是尊重宗教的善行，而是破坏宗教的恶行”。
    从这些权威的谈话中可以看出，只是反动分子的犯罪行为才造成了对于某些寺院的威胁。正是反动分子为了维护农奴制而强迫僧侣违背佛教信条而拿起武器，他们不惜采取极端手段，直到屠杀那些拒绝服从他们的人。正如西藏许多宗教人士所强调指出的，而中国当局甚至在平息叛乱的过程中还一直保护寺院和文化历史古迹。
    必须指出，在中国，宗教信仰完全自由。许多访问过中国和关心这方面情况的人都坚信这一点。例如，不止一次地访问过中国的吴努先生1959年4月14日在纽约的记者招待会上说，在西藏有宗教信仰自由，中国在共产党人时代比在蒋介石统治下有更大的宗教信仰自由。1959年夏天访问过中国的世界佛教徒联谊会副会长、尼泊尔的阿姆里塔南达法师说：“我这次访问中国时，不仅看到了工业和农业的迅速提高，还看到中国有真正的宗教信仰自由”。
    围绕“西藏问题”大肆叫嚣的人对真正的事实完全不感兴趣，他们只是重复毫无根据的诬蔑
    但是，围绕“西藏问题”大肆叫嚣的人对真正的事实完全不感兴趣。为了对中华人民共和国进行荒谬的诬蔑，这些人不惜厚颜无耻地歪曲和?造关于中国一个地区的情况的事实。有一些国家的代表重复着毫无根据的、有时甚至可笑的诬蔑，他们所援引的事实大部分是西藏的某些反动流亡者的恶意的谰言和荒谬的?造以及围绕“西藏问题”大肆叫嚣的人们所泡制的假材料。
    在这方面，不能不注意到：某些代表企图根据所谓“国际法学家委员会”的材料来给自己的“控告”找理由，大家知道，这一委员会的建立是为“冷战”目的服务的。它的全部活动到目前为止只是为了一个目的——对社会主义国家进行歪曲和散布谣言。也同样用这种方法，委员会编造出来了关于西藏问题的材料。为了说明它的调查值几文钱，我想提一提这个“委员会”的积极成员特里孔达斯先生的一个所谓“发现”。今年6月6日，“纽约时报”引用特里孔达斯先生的话说达赖喇嘛在拉萨的宫殿全部被中国炮兵毁坏了。其实，“纽约时报”编辑部可以很容易看出这个谎言的虚伪性，因为布达拉宫仍然是完好无损。那些以诽谤人民中国为能事的人显然是按照撒谎越多越好的原则行事的。
    鉴于敌视中国的人散布了很多有关西藏的谎言，所以还必须谈谈西藏生活的其他方面。
    中华人民共和国政府为了发展西藏地区的经济和文化，做了许多工作
    为了发展这个地区的经济和文化，为了提高西藏居民的物质生活水平，中华人民共和国政府做了许多工作。开展了公路建设。除了修复旧有的公路外，还修筑了七千多公里长的新的公路。这样一来，就有可能给西藏地区人民运送去大批他们所需要的工业品和其他商品。人民政权削减了税收，提高了羊毛和当地其他产品的收购价格，给农民发放了巨额的无利息贷款和无须偿还的贷款。西藏的第一批工业企业投入生产了。开办了许多中小学校。设立了许多医疗机关和兽医机关。西藏人从各个方面看到了新的、更为美好的生活的光辉灿烂的前景。
    同时必须强调指出，在整整八年的时间内，中华人民共和国政府考虑到西藏的特殊条件，因此在那里施行任何措施时都遵循着谨慎的方针。关于这一点，班禅额尔德尼在1959年4月22日曾说过如下的话：“中央为了等待反动分子的悔悟，一再忍让，做到了仁至义尽”。然而，西藏封建上层中的反动分子不愿意实现地方民主自治，他们千方百计地阻挠为建立西藏自治区而进行的筹备工作。
    尤其是，在1959年3月，同某些帝国主义集团和蒋介石卖国集团有联系的一小撮西藏反动分子在国外势力的怂恿下竟背信弃义企图手执武器阻止西藏农奴制度不可避免的崩溃并妄想使西藏脱离中国。但是，西藏人民不仅没有跟着反动分子跑，而且完全拥护政府。因此，秩序很快地恢复了，居民得以恢复和平的劳动。
    西藏封建上层一部分反动分子所发动的武装叛乱不仅再一次表明自己是外国势力的走狗和民族团结的敌人，而且还暴露了自己是西藏人民进步和繁荣的死敌。西藏人民清楚地看到了这些反动分子的本来面目，因此，西藏人民能够摆脱了农奴制的枷锁和实现自己对民主自治和社会进步的夙愿。不仅农民要求进行这些改革，而且在中、上层居民中还有大批主张实行改革的爱国人士和进步人士也要求进行这些改革。
    现在进行的民主改革是经过长期同西藏著名人士进行协商并得到各阶层居民完全拥护之后才开始的。这些改革是由西藏人自己（包括上、中层的西藏居民）实行的。班禅额尔德尼说，“我们在实现改革时，将遵循赎买政策，也就是通过和平的方式对西藏的上层居民实行改革的政策。”班禅额尔德尼今年10月14日在他的报告中坚决地驳斥了某些集团利用联合国来诬蔑西藏人民新生活的企图，他说：“西藏人民是根本不会因为帝国主义分子的叫嚣而改变自己的前进方向的……我们一定要在中央人民政府的领导下，彻底破坏残酷、野蛮、反动、落后的封建农奴制度……”。
    从上面列举的事实可以十分清楚地看到，无论在什么样的借口下在联合国大会讨论“西藏问题”，那是多么令人不能容忍和多么有害。在这里我想援引中国人民日报的几句话。人民日报在表明中国人民对别国干涉中国内政的态度时写道：“这是丝毫不容任何外国或者联合国以任何名义任何形式干涉的。因此，西藏的任何问题，都只能由中国解决，在中国解决，而不能在任何外国去解决。”（“西藏的革命和尼赫鲁的哲学”1959年5月6日人民日报——新华社注）
    提出“西藏问题”的人是那些不希望缓和国际紧张局势和停止军备竞赛的集团
    再一次唆使联合国大会破坏联合国宪章并利用大会来煽动敌视和仇恨伟大的中国人民，这究竟是为什么呢？
    这一切都说明，我们在这里面临的是：有人愚蠢地企图使联合国回到“冷战”的黑暗时期。这种勾当的主谋者想要阻挠最近以来为了改善国际关系所做的一些积极的和建设性的努力。那些不希望缓和紧张局势和停止军备竞赛的集团正是策划向本届大会提出“西藏问题”的人。爱尔兰和马来亚代表团只不过是这些集团的意志的表达者、是在热中于加剧国际紧张局势的人所导演的一出丑剧中扮演丑角而已。
    侵略集团之所以需要干这种勾当，还因为想借以打击中华人民共和国和亚洲其他国家的合作，破坏亚非各国人民在争取加强民族独立、争取持久和平的斗争中的团结。西方的某些集团不甘心它们的殖民统治的垮台，因而狂热地采取各种手段来遏止各国人民民族解放斗争的进一步发展，阻挠各国人民按着自己的愿望处理事务。
    亚非人民亲眼看到，近年来，某些帝国主义集团一直在千方百计地加剧亚洲和远东地区的紧张局势；扩大侵略集团的战争活动和破坏活动，甚至把这种活动扩展到中立国家；阻挠关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的实现等等。就是下面这样的事实也可以证明这点：虽然中国人民志愿军早就全部撤出了北朝鲜，而美国军队至今还留在南朝鲜，台湾和中国其他岛屿仍然被占领着，并被用来对中国人民进行侵略活动和保持远东的紧张局势。南越当局在外来的唆使下拒绝履行日内瓦会议关于在北越和南越进行选举的决定。南越和老挝、台湾和南朝鲜都被用来制造对亚洲国家和平和安全的威胁。
    有人显然是故意把目前对“西藏问题”的叫嚣安排在这样的时候：这时，六亿五千万中国人民和他们的全世界的朋友们正欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国成立的光辉的十周年，在这十年中中华人民共和国在发展国家经济和文化方面取得了巨大成就，中华人民共和国的国际威望获得了空前提高。
    无庸置疑，对人民中国新的恶毒的攻击，就同过去的一切诽谤一样，丝毫也不能影响中国人民向着社会主义胜利前进，丝毫不能阻止中华人民共和国国际威信的继续巩固。
      苏联代表团坚决反对讨论所谓“西藏问题”
    在联合国中出现所谓“西藏问题”，还证明，某些人士企图转移大会对真正急待解决的国际问题的注意力。难怪，最近报纸有消息说，某些代表团想利用“西藏问题”为借口，以逃避在本届大会议程的其他问题上进行认真的合作。
    苏联代表团认为，在改善国际局势方面出现的良好进展为各国代表在联合国内进行广泛的实事求是的合作创造了有利的条件。苏联代表团方面过去努力，将来仍要努力和各国代表团合作，寻求联合国所有会员国都能接受的解决列入会议议程中的重大国际问题的办法。我们愿意尽一切努力，使本届会议真正作为各国人民之间的和平和友谊的会议载入联合国的史册。各国代表团在改善国际关系方面采取的任何具体步骤都将受到苏联代表团的全力支持。
    但是，我们无论如何不能支持那些不是为了改善国际关系，而是加剧国际关系的步骤。提出所谓“西藏问题”的阴谋就是这种步骤。决不能一面主张改善关系，另一面又支持在联合国讨论西藏这一类的问题，因为，这种问题无疑会导致这种关系的加剧。
    争取缓和紧张局势和不允许在联合国中出现使我们回到“冷战”时期中去的问题，是我们共同的责任，是各国代表团的责任。在这种情况下，各国人民就不会埋怨说联合国大会第十四届会议又在制造新的危险的“冷战”冰山，这种冰山现在已被推入令人寄予希望的暖流中。
    苏联代表团坚决反对在联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”。当然，苏联代表团将投票反对爱尔兰和马来亚提出的关于西藏的提案。关于这个问题的任何提案都是非法的，因为这违反联合国宪章中禁止干涉别国内政的规定。
    苏联代表团关心联合国在解决裁军问题和旨在改善国际局势的其他重大问题上履行自己的职责，因而希望联合国大会第十四届会议不要使自己走上危害和平事业和危害联合国本身存在的道路。
