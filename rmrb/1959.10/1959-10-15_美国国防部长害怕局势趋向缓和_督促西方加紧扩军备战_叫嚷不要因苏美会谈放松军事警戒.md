Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, 14th: U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy has been in Wellington for several days, advocating that the West should continue to strengthen its military preparations.

On his first day of activities in New Zealand (October 13), McElroy clamored at a press conference that Western countries should not relax their military vigilance and strength in any way because of the recent talks between Eisenhower and Khrushchev.

He had to agree that relations between East and West were beginning to achieve a relaxation. However, he emphasized that "during the talks before an agreement is reached, the West must maintain its military strength in case things do not go as hoped."

On the 14th, McElroy wantonly slandered the "threat" of the Soviet Union and China at a press conference. He said that the United States does not plan to cut its military budget for next year, and that U.S. military spending will remain at the current level of $41 billion next year.

McElroy will be active in New Zealand for three days. He held talks with New Zealand Prime Minister Nash and other cabinet ministers on the 14th.

Prior to this, McElroy held talks with Australian Minister of Defense Townley in Canberra. According to Townley, they reviewed the international treaties affecting Southeast Asia, including the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. They also discussed military equipment and missile issues.

McElroy left New York on September 20 for a "trip" to the Pacific region. He has successively carried out activities in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Continuing military expansion and preparations for war is the focus of the U.S. Secretary of Defense's propaganda and planning all the way.

    督促西方加紧扩军备战
    叫嚷不要因苏美会谈放松军事警戒
    新华社14日讯　惠灵顿消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊连日在惠灵顿鼓吹西方要继续加强军备。
    麦克耳罗伊在他到达新西兰活动的第一天（13日），就在记者招待会上叫嚷，西方国家不应该由于艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫最近的会谈而对军事警戒和力量有任何放松。
    他不得不同意，东西方之间的关系正在开始取得一种缓和。但是，他强调说，“在达成协议以前的会谈期间，西方一定要保持它的军事力量，以防万一事情并不像所希望的那样进行”。
    14日，麦克耳罗伊在记者招待会上大肆诬蔑苏联和中国的“威胁”。他说，美国并没有计划削减它的明年的军事预算，明年美国的军事开支将保持在现在的四百一十亿美元的水平。
    麦克耳罗伊将在新西兰活动三天。他在14日和新西兰总理纳许以及其他内阁部长举行了会谈。
    在这以前，麦克耳罗伊在堪培拉同澳大利亚国防部长陶恩利举行过会谈。据陶恩利透露，他们回顾了影响东南亚的国际条约，其中包括东南亚条约组织。他们还讨论了军事装备和导弹问题。
    麦克耳罗伊是在9月20日离开纽约到太平洋地区来“旅行”的。他先后在日本、南朝鲜、台湾和菲律宾等地进行活动。继续扩军备战是这位美国国防部长一路上宣传和策划的中心。
