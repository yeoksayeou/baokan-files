Expedition into the Desert

The film "Expedition into the Desert" records the experiences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' desert control team as they explored the Badain Jaran Desert in Inner Mongolia. As the desert control team ventured deeper into the desert, its ruthless and stingy nature gradually became apparent. It offered the visitors not a single blade of grass, not a drop of water, not a single inhabitant. The desert control team discovered the ruins of an ancient city called "Heichengzi" in the desert. But they were greeted by a desolate and uninhabited ruin. However, Badain Jaran still finally received them with black beetles somewhat resembling helicopters, small jumping mice that were extremely good at burrowing, precious Cistanche deserticola, and rare spring water; the most generous thing was that it allowed them to enter one of its treasures – a large salt lake that did not yet have a name. Only after helping the desert remove the wind disasters upon its body will Badain Jaran become generous. This is also the purpose of the desert control team. [Xin Xuan] (Attached image)

    远征沙漠
    影片“远征沙漠”记录了中国科学院治沙队探问内蒙古巴丹吉林沙漠的情景。当治沙队进入沙漠深处以后，它那无情吝啬的性格逐渐显露出来了。它不给来客一根草、一滴水、一个居民。治沙队在沙漠中发现了一个名叫“黑城子”的古城遗迹。但迎接他们的是一个颓败不堪杳无人迹的废墟。不过巴丹吉林总还在最后用有点像直升飞机的黑甲虫、极善于打洞的小跳鼠、名贵的肉从蓉、稀有的泉水接待了他们；最慷慨的要算它让他们进入了它的一个宝库——还没有名字的大盐池。帮助沙漠除去它身上的风灾以后，巴丹吉林才会变得慷慨起来。这也是治沙队的目的。　〔辛萱〕（附图片）
