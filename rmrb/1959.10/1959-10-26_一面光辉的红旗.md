A Glorious Red Flag
Commentator of this newspaper

In the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," Comrade Mao Zedong enthusiastically introduced the deeds of the Wang Guofan Cooperative and gave it high praise. He said:

"In the cooperative movement in Zunhua County, there was a Wang Guofan Cooperative. The twenty-three poor peasant households only had three donkey legs, and were called the 'poverty cooperative.' Through their own efforts, they 'brought from the mountains' a large number of means of production in three years, moving some visitors to tears. I think this is the image of our entire country. Can't 600 million poor people, through their own efforts, become a socialist country that is both rich and strong in a few decades? Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not avoid problems but solve them with a positive attitude, any human difficulty can be solved." The fact that the Wang Guofan Cooperative (now developed into the Jianming People's Commune) and thousands of other communes across the country have seen rapid production development in just over three years has fully proven the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of this assertion!

The era of "three donkey legs" is gone forever. In this poor mountain valley, which used to suffer frequent natural disasters, a great leap forward surge emerged last year, and the Wang Guofan Cooperative continued to undergo tremendous changes. In 1958, they established the Jianming Commune, with an average yield of 488 jin per mu, crossing the Yellow River with a tremendous leap forward; an increase of two times compared to 1952 before the cooperative, and more than 20% compared to 1957. The original "poverty cooperative" (now a team in Jianming Commune) achieved an average yield of 606 jin per mu, an increase of more than four times compared to 1952. This year, this commune is continuing to leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward. The profound changes that have taken place in Jianming People's Commune in such a short period of time are a vivid image of the ambitious and determined spirit of our hardworking and courageous people to change the face of "poverty and blankness," and a microcosm of the rapid development of rural production from poverty to wealth in our country.

The rapid development of production in the Jianming Commune, in addition to the fundamental reason that the people's commune has a large organizational scale and a wide range of operations, is also because the cadres and members of this commune have always maintained high aspirations and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. Although the Jianming Commune has developed from an agricultural cooperative with "three donkey legs" into a people's commune with some tractors, portable steam engines, water pumps, and power generation equipment in a short period of a few years, and agricultural production has increased by two times; the vast majority of members are not satisfied with these existing achievements. They actively demand a greater leap forward in agricultural production, not an increase of two times, but an increase of dozens of times; they actively demand more agricultural machinery, power generation equipment, chemical fertilizers, and chemical pesticides; they actively demand that their "poor and blank" country become a rich and strong country... Precisely because they see far and have lofty ideals, their revolutionary enthusiasm grows stronger year by year. They adhere to the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and strive to develop agricultural production. While developing agricultural production, they attach great importance to the development of animal husbandry, and therefore animal husbandry has developed rapidly. This provides agriculture with sufficient draft animal power and a large amount of high-quality fertilizer. They have also planted many trees and fruit trees, which not only preserve the soil and water in the mountains and enable the river beach land to obtain stable harvests, but also green the barren mountains and courtyards. Income from sideline occupations and handicraft production is a very important source of funds for them, thus effectively supporting the development of grain production.

On the other hand, the Jianming Commune is also very good at "managing its affairs." After communization, although agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have greatly developed, and the income of the commune and its members has greatly increased, they have not abandoned the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative during the agricultural cooperative period. In the past, they lived frugally in poverty; now, they live frugally even in wealth. They have achieved diligence and thrift in production, and diligence and thrift in life; diligence and thrift in major matters, and diligence and thrift in minor matters; diligence and thrift by cadres, and diligence and thrift by the masses. This year alone, they saved more than 100,000 yuan in production expenses and management fees. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "China is a large country, but it is still very poor. It will take decades to make China rich. Even after decades, it will still be necessary to implement the principle of diligence and thrift." This makes it very clear that we must not think that in the past one or two years, agricultural production has doubled and redoubled, and that many factories have been built, so we can eat and drink extravagantly, build buildings and repair houses, and greatly improve our lives. For the sake of a greater leap forward in agricultural production, and also for the sake of a happier life in the future, we must adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune and managing the household, spend more money on production, spend less money on life, eat a little more when busy, and eat a little less when idle.

The reason why Jianming Commune can do this is first and foremost because the party members and cadres of this commune can set an example by exerting full effort to develop production and run the commune diligently and thriftily. For example, Comrade Wang Guofan, the leading cadre of this commune, is one of the representatives. After communization, he continued to participate in production, and when producing, he worked more, faster, and better than the average member. The members reflected: Wang Guofan is a good cadre and a good laborer. This not only further strengthened the ties with the broad masses, but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

Jianming Commune is not only a red flag in Hebei Province, but also a model for people's communes across the country. People's communes across the country should, like the people's communes in Hebei Province, learn from Jianming Commune, learn from Jianming Commune's soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, comprehensively develop agricultural production, and learn from Jianming Commune's spirit of diligence and thrift in running the commune and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. Communes and production teams that are doing well or relatively well in production, and are prosperous or relatively prosperous in life, should continue to work hard to make production leap forward again and again, catching up with and surpassing Jianming Commune; communes and teams that are not doing well in production and are not yet prosperous in life should speed up, catch up quickly, muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and forge ahead bravely! Let thousands of Jianming Communes emerge across the country! Let thousands of communes across the country surpass Jianming Commune!

    一面光辉的红旗
    本报评论员
    在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书中，毛泽东同志曾经满腔热情地介绍了王国藩合作社的事迹，并给予很高评价。他说：
  “遵化县的合作化运动中，有一个王国藩合作社，二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为‘穷棒子社’。他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，‘从山上取来’了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的”。仅仅三年多一点时间，王国藩社（现在发展为建明人民公社）和全国成千上万个公社的生产飞速发展的事实，已经充分证明了这一论断的无比英明和正确！
    “三条驴腿”的时期已一去不返了。在这个过去经常遭受自然灾害的穷山沟里，去年涌现了大跃进的热潮，王国藩合作社继续发生了巨大的变化。1958年，他们建立了建明公社，全社平均亩产达到四百八十八斤，以特大跃进的步伐跨过了黄河；比合作化前的1952年增产两倍，比1957年增产20％多。原来的“穷棒子社”（现在是建明社的一个队）平均亩产达到六百零六斤，比1952年增加了四倍以上。今年，这个公社正在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。建明人民公社在短短时间内发生这样深刻变化，是我国勤劳而勇敢的人民改变“一穷二白”面貌的雄心大志发奋图强的生动形象，是我国农村生产飞跃发展由穷变富的一个缩影。
    建明公社生产的飞跃发展，除了人民公社组织规模大，经营范围广这个根本原因外，还因为这个公社的干部和社员始终保持着雄心大志和冲天的革命干劲。建明公社虽然在短短的几年内从“三条驴腿”的农业社，发展成为拥有一部分拖拉机、锅驼机、抽水机和发电设备的人民公社，农业生产增长了两倍；但是广大社员并不满足这些已有的成就，他们积极要求农业生产有更大的跃进，不是增长两倍，而是增长十几倍、几十倍；他们积极要求有更多的农业机器、发电设备和化学肥料、化学农药；他们积极要求自己的“一穷二白”的国家变成一个又富又强的国家……正因为他们看得远，有远大理想，他们的革命干劲一年大一年，他们坚持以粮为纲的农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的方针，努力发展农业生产。在发展农业生产的同时，他们极为重视畜牧业的发展，因而畜牧业发展得很快。这样，使农业有了充足的畜力和大量的优质肥料。他们又栽植了很多林木果树，不仅使山地的水土得到保持，使河滩地可以获得稳定的收成，而且绿化了荒山，绿化了庭院。副业、手工业生产的收入，是他们一项极为重要的资金来源，从而有效地支持了粮食生产的发展。
    另一方面，建明公社又很会“过日子”。公社化后，农、林、牧、副、渔虽然有了很大的发展，公社和社员的收入虽然有了很大的增加，但是他们仍然没有丢掉农业合作社时期的勤俭办社的原则。过去是穷日子穷过，现在是富日子也当穷日子过。他们做到了生产勤俭，生活也勤俭；大事勤俭，小事也勤俭；干部勤俭，群众也勤俭。只今年的生产开支和管理费两项，就节省了十多万元。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则”。这就很明白了，我们千万不能以为近一二年来，农业生产翻了一两番，而且还办起了许多工厂，可以大吃大喝了，可以起楼修房了，可以大大改善生活了。为了农业生产更大的跃进，也是为了将来获得更加幸福的生活，我们要坚持勤俭办社和勤俭持家的原则，花在生产上的钱要多一点，花在生活上的钱要少一点，忙时多吃一点，闲时少吃一点。
    建明公社所以能够做到这一点，首先因为这个公社的党员干部能够以身作则地鼓足干劲，发展生产，勤俭办社。例如这个公社的领导干部王国藩同志就是其中的一个代表人物。公社化以后，他继续参加生产，在生产时，还比一般社员干得多，干得快，干得好。社员反映：王国藩是好干部，又是好劳动力。这样，不仅更加密切了和广大群众的联系，而且大大激发了群众的积极性和创造性。
    建明公社不仅是河北省的一面红旗，也是全国人民公社的一个榜样。全国各地人民公社应当像河北省各人民公社一样，向建明公社学习，学习建明公社冲天的革命干劲，全面发展农业生产，学习建明公社勤俭办社的精神，勤俭办好一切事业。现在生产搞得好和比较好的、生活富裕和比较富裕的公社、生产队，应当继续努力，使生产跃进再跃进，赶上和超过建明社；生产搞得不太好、生活还不富裕的社、队，应当快马加鞭，急起直追，鼓足更大的革命干劲，奋勇前进！让全国出现成千上万个建明公社！让全国成千上万个公社超过建明公社！
