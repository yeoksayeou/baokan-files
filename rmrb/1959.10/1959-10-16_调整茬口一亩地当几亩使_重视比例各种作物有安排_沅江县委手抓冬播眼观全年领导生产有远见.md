　　The Yuanjiang County Party Committee Grasps Winter Planting and Keeps an Eye on the Overall Situation, Leading Production with Foresight
　　(Our newspaper, Changsha, 15th dispatch) Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, has summarized its production experience over the years, rationally arranged the area for winter crops, which not only guarantees a comprehensive increase in summer grain production but also rationally adjusts crop rotation and increases the multiple cropping index, preparing conditions for achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. At present, the communes are actively carrying out winter planting preparations.
　　How to determine the area for overwintering crops this year involves the intersection of a three-crops-a-year system and a five-crops-in-two-years system, the arrangement of double-cropping rice and rice-wheat rotation for next year, the rational allocation of grain crop area and economic crop area, and various specific issues such as fertilizer and labor. Therefore, as early as the beginning of August, the Yuanjiang County Party Committee led the people's communes in studying and formulating winter crop planting plans. Before formulating the plans, the communes held symposiums attended by commune and team cadres, production models, and experienced farmers, starting with summarizing production experience over the years, paying attention to the interrelationship between this year's production and next year's production, ensuring that the sowing seasons of the previous and next crops were connected, and analyzing the superiority of the people's commune's "large scale and high degree of public ownership" and the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production next year, and formulated their respective winter planting plans. The winter planting plans of many communes show that if dry land planned for cotton next year is planted with green manure this winter, and dry land planned for jute next year is sown with rapeseed this winter, and if grass seed (green manure) seed retention fields are converted to plant single-season late indica rice next year, this will not only not delay the planting season but also ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of cotton, jute, single-season late indica rice, green manure, and rapeseed. To benefit rice growth next year, many places have also changed the land that used to grow wheat to single-season spring potatoes, because wheat needs to be harvested until "Grain Full" or "Grain in Ear," which can easily delay the transplanting season; at the same time, wheat requires a lot of fertilizer, and if the fertilizer is not adequately supplemented when planting rice, it may cause a reduction in yield, while spring potatoes can be harvested before "Grain Full," completely avoiding the above contradictions.
　　After a comprehensive arrangement of crop rotation, some communes have also greatly increased the multiple cropping index. For example, the Chishan Commune has begun to improve the multiple cropping rotation system, adjusting the farming and cultivation methods such as continuous cropping, intercropping, relay cropping, and mixed cropping of various crops, and the multiple cropping index has been greatly increased. The area of land with three crops a year has increased from the original 8,787 mu to more than 29,000 mu, and the area of land with four crops a year has reached more than 7,000 mu, with a multiple cropping index of 285%, an increase of 97% over last year.
　　In the past, many people believed that green manure could not be planted in double-cropping late rice fields. The County Party Committee summarized the experience of the county farm in planting green manure in double-cropping rice fields for the past two years, achieving a high yield of 3,000 jin per mu, and decided to expand the planting of green manure to 280,000 mu this winter.
　　In arranging the area for winter crops, the County Party Committee found that the allocation of winter grain crops and economic crops in some communes was not entirely rational, and the rapeseed planting area was less than the state plan. It immediately requested that the communes, while complying with the state plan, take into account both yield and output value, and the rapeseed area should not be reduced, and more spring-harvested miscellaneous grain crops should be planted as much as possible. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the communes discussed and revised the winter planting plan from the bottom up, achieving more planting and more harvesting. The county has hundreds of thousands of mu of lake shore, which is mostly flooded after the rapeseed harvest every year and was rarely used in the past. This year, in order to increase oil crops and spring-harvested miscellaneous grain crops, the communes vigorously reclaimed the lake shore and planted rapeseed, wheat, broad beans, and green manure. The Sanyantang Commune alone reclaimed 5,000 mu of lake shore and barren land. In the past, the Caowei Commune only planted rice, and the total output value was very low. This year, the Commune Party Committee decided that, without affecting the completion of the total grain output, on the one hand, they would utilize the lake fields, and on the other hand, they would convert more than 36,000 mu of paddy fields in the commune into dry land and plant rapeseed and green manure in winter, and plant jute and other economic crops next year.
　　After arranging the planting area, the communes are implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" responsibility system for winter crops to the teams, based on the principle of being both active and reliable, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the members for doing a good job in winter planting. At the same time, various localities have also actively carried out winter planting technical preparations and material preparations. The communes have held symposiums for commune and team cadres and experienced farmers to summarize and exchange experiences in achieving bumper harvests of spring-harvested crops. At present, an autumn manure accumulation campaign has been launched throughout the county to prepare winter planting fertilizer in advance. To solve the problem of the shortage of green manure and other seeds, the County Party Committee led the communes, brigades, and production teams in conducting a general seed inspection, clarifying the base of seed surpluses and shortages, and then used methods such as equivalent exchange and seed-for-seed to organize inter-commune and inter-brigade exchanges, adjusting more than 110,000 jin of seeds. The County Seed Station and commercial departments have sent 37 cadres to various places to purchase more than 50,000 jin of various improved varieties.

　　调整茬口一亩地当几亩使  重视比例各种作物有安排
    沅江县委手抓冬播眼观全年领导生产有远见
    本报长沙15日电　湖南省沅江县总结历年来的生产经验，合理安排冬播作物面积，既能保证夏粮全面增产，又合理调整茬口，提高复种指数，为实现明年农业生产大丰收准备了条件。目前各公社正积极进行冬播准备工作。
    今年越冬作物面积如何确定，这涉及一年三熟制和二年五熟制的交叉进行、明年双季稻和稻麦连作的安排、粮食作物面积和经济作物面积的合理分配，还涉及到肥料、劳力等各种具体问题。因此，中共沅江县委早在8月上旬就领导各人民公社研究和制定了冬种作物播种方案。在制定方案前，各公社都召开了社、队干部、生产模范和老农参加的座谈会，从总结历年来的生产经验着手，注意今年生产与明年生产的相互关系，做到上季和下季作物播种季节互相衔接，并且分析了人民公社一大二公的优越性和明年农业生产大跃进的形势，制订了各自的冬播方案。许多公社的冬播方案表明：如把明年计划种棉花的旱地今冬种绿肥，明年种黄麻的旱地今冬播油菜，把草子（绿肥）留种田明年改插一季晚粳，这不仅不会延误播种季节，还能保证棉花、黄麻、一季晚粳、绿肥、油菜的全面丰收。为了有利于明年水稻生长，许多地方还把过去种小麦的地改种一季春马铃薯，因为麦子要到“小满”或“芒种”才收割，容易延误插秧季节；同时小麦需肥较多，如果种水稻时肥料补充不足，就可能造成减产，而春马铃薯在“小满”以前可以收完，完全可以避免上述的矛盾。
    有些公社对茬口经过全面安排后，还大大提高了复种指数。如赤山公社着手改进复种轮作制度，调整各种农作物的连作、间作、套作、混作等耕作栽培方式，复种指数大大提高。一年三熟的田土由原来的八千七百八十七亩增加到二万九千多亩，一年四熟的田土达七千多亩，复种指数达到285％，比去年提高97％。
    过去许多人认为双季晚稻田不能种绿肥，县委总结了县农场近两年来在双季稻田播种绿肥，每亩获得三千斤的丰产经验，决定今冬扩种绿肥二十八万亩。
    在安排冬播作物面积中，县委发现有的公社冬播粮食作物和经济作物面积分配不尽合理，油菜种植面积比国家计划少，立即要求各公社在服从国家计划的前提下，既算产量账又算产值账，油菜面积不能减少，还要尽量多种一些春收杂粮作物。各公社根据县委的指示，又自下而上讨论修订了冬播方案，作到多种多收。全县有几十万亩湖洲，每年涨水时期多在油菜收割以后，过去都很少利用。今年，各公社为了增加油料和春收杂粮作物，便大力开垦湖洲，种植油菜、小麦、蚕豆和绿肥。仅三眼塘公社就开垦了湖洲、荒坪五千亩。草尾公社过去单纯种水稻，生产总值很低。今年公社党委决定在不影响完成粮食总产量的前提下，一方面利用湖田，另一方面将全社三万六千多亩放水田改为旱地，在冬季播种油菜、绿肥，明年播种黄麻等经济作物。
    在安排好播种面积后，各公社正本着既积极又可靠的原则，对冬季作物实行了“三包一奖”到队的责任制，大大鼓舞了社员们搞好冬种的积极性。与此同时，各地还积极进行了冬播技术准备和物资准备，各公社都召开了社、队干部和老农座谈会，总结和交流了春收作物丰产的经验。目前，全县已掀起了秋季积肥运动，提早准备冬播肥料。为了解决绿肥等种子缺乏的问题，县委领导各公社、大队、生产队，普遍进行了一次种子检查，摸清种子余缺的底子，然后用等价交换和以种换种等方法，组织公社与公社、大队与大队之间互通有无，调剂了种子十一万多斤。县种子站和商业部门已派出三十七个干部分赴外地采购各种良种五万余斤。
