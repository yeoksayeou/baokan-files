Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Zhu De, dear comrades and friends:

    Please allow me, and also on behalf of the Chinese Party and government delegation present here, to express our heartfelt thanks to you for attending today's reception.

    Today we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The founding of the German Democratic Republic is rightly regarded as a turning point in European history. Due to the establishment of the Republic, the regime of German militarists and imperialists, who had brought profound suffering to the people of Europe, and first and foremost to the German people, was forever crushed on a part of German territory, and this regime was greatly weakened throughout Germany.

    Today, our young worker-peasant state has spent ten years of hard work, which is also the greatest revolutionary decade in German history. This revolution was completed by the masses of the people under the leadership of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, after the glorious Soviet army liberated our country.

    In this short historical period, the German Democratic Republic, as the first peace-loving German state, has developed into an important factor in European political and economic life. The German Democratic Republic has established the foundation of socialism and basically completed all other prerequisites for socialist construction in a short historical period.

    In terms of economic strength, the German Democratic Republic is one of the largest industrial countries in Europe. The seven-year plan of the German Democratic Republic, which was adopted into law by the People's Chamber a few days ago, stipulates that by 1965, our country's industrial production will be quadrupled compared with 1936. Increasing wages and lowering prices will increase the real income of the working people by 60% to 65% in the next seven years, while shortening working hours to seven hours.

    This development of the German Democratic Republic has great national and international significance. It proves that if the German people use their strength for peaceful construction and West Germany also abandons any imperialist policy of conquest, chauvinist border demands, revenge, atomic armament and militarism, the German people can live in peace, prosperity and happiness and have a great future. It proves that there is a path that can turn the whole of Germany from a dangerous hotbed of a new war of plunder into a fortress of peace and friendship among all peoples.

    The German Democratic Republic has pursued a consistent policy of peace since the first day of its founding. Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes and fully supports the bold disarmament proposal put forward by Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, which conforms to the greatest aspirations of all peoples.

    The German Democratic Republic is closely united with the fraternal countries united in the socialist camp, implementing its peaceful policies and carrying out socialist construction. The assistance of the socialist camp, its firm attitude in defending peace, and its firm and uncompromising support for the anti-colonialist liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples, as well as support for building their countries' independent national economies, have made our republic's international prestige grow. At the Geneva Six-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States, Britain and France had to de facto recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic and the fact that the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European peace cannot be resolved without its active participation. Paying attention to these historical facts will surely enable all countries that oppose war and imperialism to fully develop relations with our republic in the near future.

    On the tenth anniversary of its founding, the German Democratic Republic expresses its gratitude to all friendly countries for their assistance and support, and here it wants to express special thanks to the People's Republic of China.

    The peoples and governments of China and Germany have developed such close friendly relations on the basis of proletarian internationalism and the common goal of building socialism, which is only possible between socialist countries. Our two countries fully support each other in all basic issues of their policies.

    Today, we are especially grateful for the support given by the People's Republic of China during and after the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference on the decisive issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

    The government and people of the German Democratic Republic follow the brave and principled Marxist-Leninist policy of the People's Republic of China with the utmost admiration. They admire the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the main projects of the second five-year plan, which are scheduled to be completed this year, which were originally scheduled for 1962. They are delighted with the consolidation and development of the People's Communes. The People's Communes have fully demonstrated their superiority in the year of their existence.

    Our Republic, together with the People's Republic of China, stands firmly in the socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union. Not long ago, the Soviet Union once again shocked and inspired the whole world with the brilliant achievements of its scientists.

    The government and people of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to ensure the victory of socialism in our country, thereby making the greatest contribution to European peace and to a unified, peace-loving and democratic Germany. In this regard, the further consolidation and development of our two countries' fraternal relations into a systematic creative socialist collaboration will be a valuable support.

    Please allow me to raise my glass,

    To the great Chinese people and their leader Comrade Mao Zedong, to the unbreakable friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China,

    To the unity and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

    To friendship and cooperation between the peoples of all countries in the interest of world peace,

    To the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

    Cheers!

### 汪戴尔大使的讲话

专栏：

    汪戴尔大使的讲话亲爱的毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、朱德同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    请允许我并且同时也代表在座的我国党政代表团衷心地感谢你们出席今天的招待会。
    今天我们庆祝德意志民主共和国成立十周年。德意志民主共和国的成立，被正确地看作是欧洲历史的转折点。由于共和国的成立，这就永远在德国的一部分土地上粉碎了德国军国主义者和帝国主义者的政权并在整个德国大大地削弱了这一政权，德国军国主义者和帝国主义者曾给欧洲人民，首先也给德国人民带来了深重的苦难。
    今天我们年轻的工农国家度过了艰苦劳动的十年，这十年也是德国历史上最伟大的革命的十年。这一革命是人民群众在工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义政党——德国统一社会党的领导下，在光荣的苏联军队解放我国以后完成的。
    在这一短短的历史时期里，德意志民主共和国作为第一个爱好和平的德意志国家发展成为欧洲政治和经济生活中的一个重要因素。德意志民主共和国建立了社会主义的基础并在一个短短的历史时期内基本上完成社会主义建设的所有其他前提。
    德意志民主共和国按照经济实力来说，是欧洲最大的工业国之一。几天前由人民议院通过成为法律的德意志民主共和国七年计划，规定到1965时把我国的工业生产与1936年相比提高四倍。提高工资、降低价格，这就使劳动人民的实际收入在今后七年内在工作时间缩短为七小时的同时提高60％到65％。
    德意志民主共和国的这种发展具有伟大的民族意义和国际意义。它证明，如果德国人民把自己的力量用在和平建设上并使西德也放弃任何帝国主义征服政策、沙文主义的边界要求、复仇、原子武装和军国主义，德意志人民就能够生活在和平、繁荣和幸福之中并有着伟大的前途。它证明，有一条道路可以使全德从一个新的掠夺战争的危险温床变成和平和各国人民友好的堡垒。
    德意志民主共和国从它成立的第一天起就奉行着坚持不渝的和平政策。因此，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎并全力支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志提出的符合各国人民最大愿望的大胆的裁军建议。
    德意志民主共和国和团结在社会主义阵营中的各兄弟国家紧密地团结一起，执行其和平政策，进行着社会主义建设。社会主义阵营的援助，自己保卫和平的坚定态度和对亚非人民反殖民主义的解放斗争的坚决和毫不妥协的支持，以及对建设他们国家独立的民族经济的支持等，使我们共和国的国际威望日益增长。在日内瓦六国外长会议上，美国、英国、法国不得不在事实上承认德意志民主共和国的存在，以及没有它的积极参加德国问题和保障欧洲和平问题就不可能得到解决的事实。重视这些历史事实一定会使所有反对战争和帝国主义的国家在不久的将来充分地发展同我们共和国的关系。
    德意志民主共和国在建国十周年的时候感谢所有友好国家所给予的援助与支持，这里特别要对中华人民共和国表示感谢。
    中德两国人民与政府在无产阶级国际主义和建设社会主义的共同目标的基础上发展了如此亲密的友好关系，这种关系只有在社会主义国家之间才有可能。我们两国互相间在它们政策的所有基本问题上都是全力以赴地相互支持。
    今天我们特别感谢对中华人民共和国在日内瓦外长会议期间和以后，在有决定意义的缔结对德和约问题上所给予的支持。
    德意志民主共和国的政府和人民以极其钦佩的心情注视着中华人民共和国的勇敢的和坚持原则的马克思列宁主义政策。它们敬佩大跃进的伟大成就以及今年就要完成预定在1962年完成的第二个五年计划的主要项目。它们对人民公社的巩固与发展感到欢欣鼓舞。人民公社在存在的一年中已完全证明了其优越性。
    我们共和国与中华人民共和国一起坚定不移地站在以强大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营中。不久以前苏联又以其科学家的辉煌成就震动和鼓舞了整个世界。
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民将尽一切力量，保证社会主义在我国的胜利，从而对欧洲和平、对一个统一、爱好和平和民主的德国作出最大的贡献。在这方面，我们两国兄弟般关系的进一步巩固与发展成为一种系统的创造性的社会主义协作将是一种宝贵的支持。
    请允许我举杯，
    为伟大的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东同志，为德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结与巩固，
    为有利于世界和平的各国人民之间的友谊与合作，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康，
    干杯！
