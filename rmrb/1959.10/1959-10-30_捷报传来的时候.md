    The Good News Arrives
    On the morning of the 26th, the Tianjin representatives staying at the Xiyuan Hotel had just gotten up when Dong Fenglou, from the Tianjin Construction Trade Union, who had rushed to Beijing from Tianjin overnight to report good news, hurried upstairs. As soon as he entered the room where the construction system representatives were staying, he shouted loudly: "Comrades, the Party committee and the trade union have sent me to report good news to you!" Everyone was happy to see that it was Old Dong and gathered around him. Dong Fenglou opened the report in his hand and read aloud, word by word: "...In order to welcome and celebrate the opening of the National Conference of Heroes, the city's construction workers launched a massive 'High Production Day' competition on the 25th. On this day, the city's 2,080 production teams and groups achieved an average labor quota of 223%."
    As soon as Dong Fenglou finished reading, everyone cheered. Lu Shan, the captain of the youth shock team, who was sitting aside, rushed to ask: "Old Dong, how is the production situation of our steel bar team?" Dong Fenglou smiled and said: "Since you came to Beijing, the team members have been very motivated. They said that even though you are gone, production must not lag behind. Didn't you change a single-head spot welding machine into a four-head one? Hehe, now your team members have changed the four heads into eight heads, increasing work efficiency by one time." Lu Shan said happily: "I will definitely bring the spirit of the conference and the advanced experience I have learned back to create even more outstanding achievements."

    捷报传来的时候
    26日早晨，住在西苑旅社的天津代表们刚刚起床，从天津连夜赶来北京报喜的天津建筑工会董凤楼同志，匆匆地跑上楼来，一进建筑系统代表们住的房间，便大声地喊道：“同志们，党委和工会派我来向你们报喜啦！”大家一看是老董，都高兴地围拢过来。董凤楼打开手里的报捷书，一字一句地念道：“……全市建筑职工为了迎接和庆祝全国群英会的召开，在25日开展了一个声势浩大的‘高产日’竞赛。这一天中，全市二千零八十个生产队、组，平均劳动定额达到223％。”
    董凤楼刚一念完，大家立刻欢腾起来。坐在一旁的青年突击队队长芦珊抢着问道：“老董，我们钢筋队的生产情况怎么样？”董凤楼笑道：“打你进京以后，队员们的干劲可足啦，他们说，虽然你走了，生产决不能落后。你原来不是把一个头的点焊机改成了四个头的吗？嘿嘿，现在你的队员们又把四个头改成八个头了，提高工作效率一倍。”芦珊高兴地说：“我一定把会议精神和学到的先进经验带回去，创造出更出色的成绩。”
