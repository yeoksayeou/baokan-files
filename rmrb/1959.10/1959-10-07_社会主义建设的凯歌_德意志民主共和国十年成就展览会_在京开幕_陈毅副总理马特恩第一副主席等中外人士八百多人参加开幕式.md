To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the "Exhibition of Ten Years of Achievements of the German Democratic Republic", jointly organized by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, opened today in the Hall of Literary Glory of the Palace Museum in the capital.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Chen Yi, attended the opening ceremony and cut the ribbon for the exhibition.

The head of the German Democratic Republic Party and Government Delegation attending the tenth anniversary celebration of the founding of our country, Hermann Materne, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, attended the opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony began at 9:20 a.m.

Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He first extended warm congratulations on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, and congratulated the exhibition on its successful opening. Zhang Xiruo said that this exhibition systematically and succinctly introduces the brilliant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the fields of politics, economy, and science and culture in the ten years since its establishment under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as well as the heroic struggle for maintaining peace, building socialism, and reunifying Germany on the basis of peace and democracy.

Zhang Xiruo said that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany began long before the establishment of our two countries. After the establishment of our two countries, the fraternal mutual support and friendly cooperation have been continuously developed and consolidated. He said that our country's economic construction has received strong support from fraternal Germany, and we believe that in the future, cooperation between China and Germany in various fields will continue to be strengthened.

The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Daniel, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that the exhibition that opened today introduces the construction achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the ten years since its establishment. The exhibition shows that under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, according to the principles and doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have eliminated the extremely unfortunate legacy left by German imperialism in one part of Germany, and are victoriously building socialism. The exhibition reflects how the German Democratic Republic, as an inseparable part of the powerful socialist camp, has developed into a fortress of peace and social progress.

Wang Daniel said that in the ten years of the existence of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, the two countries have established fraternal relations. This exhibition will help promote understanding between the people of our two countries and enlighten us on how to deepen and expand our fraternal relations.

Also present at the opening ceremony today to offer congratulations were Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Ding Xilin, Qu Wu, and Luo Jun, Deputy Directors of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade; Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; Liu Aifeng and Rong Gaotang, Vice Presidents of the China-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association; Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and more than 800 people from all walks of life.

Experts from the German Democratic Republic in Beijing, some members of the Dresden Symphony Orchestra of the German Democratic Republic, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries to China also attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition.

The Exhibition of Ten Years of Achievements of the German Democratic Republic has five exhibition halls, with an exhibition area of 2,000 square meters. Hundreds of pictures, models, and objects concentrate on showing the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the fields of politics, economy, and science and culture in the ten years since its establishment. The exhibition prominently introduces the rapid development of the machinery industry and chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic. In just ten years, the shipbuilding industry has developed to the point where it can build 10,000-ton giant ships; after the aviation industry was established in a short period of time, it can now build medium-range jet passenger planes. The exhibition displayed some new, highly technical machines, including cylindrical grinders with a precision of one-thousandth of a millimeter, 300-horsepower marine diesel engines, and automatic knitting machines that knit a pair of socks in nine minutes. At present, the export volume of the machinery manufacturing industry of the German Democratic Republic accounts for more than half of the total national export volume. In the chemical industry, especially the plastics industry, the German Democratic Republic has achieved a high degree of development in the past ten years. The exhibition displays colorful plastic products and textiles made of synthetic fibers. Among the exhibits is a "Five-Star" brand car with a hood made entirely of plastic. The exhibition also displays advanced, precision optical instruments, cameras, medical equipment, and electrical equipment.

The exhibition displays a mobile film projection vehicle, which can project movies in the daytime, symbolizing the friendship between China and Germany. This is a precious gift given to the Chinese government by the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, during its visit to our country this spring.

The exhibition reflects the situation of the people of the German Democratic Republic enhancing their friendship with the people of various countries, as well as the struggle of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany against the revival of German militarism and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. The exhibition also introduces the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of the people of the German Democratic Republic under the leadership and care of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
