To conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is an important matter for the entire Party at present. Through this study, we must thoroughly criticize and correct the right-leaning thoughts and emotions of some cadres, expose and overcome the right-leaning activities of certain people; deepen the understanding of Party members and cadres regarding the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement; their understanding of the laws and situation of class struggle during the period of socialist construction; further draw a clear line in ideology between the proletarian world view and the bourgeois world view, between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries, and between Marxists and some "fellow travelers," so as to raise the ideological level and Party spirit of the entire Party a step further.

In order to make this study more effective, it is necessary to revisit and emphasize a slogan repeatedly advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, which is that all Party comrades should always be promoters of the revolution, and not be regressives.

Why must we be promoters? Fundamentally speaking, the reason why Communists carry out revolution is to make society continuously develop and progress. Therefore, revolution is also "promoting" social advancement. Throughout history, countless revolutionaries have worked to promote social development. However, they could not always be promoters. Often, they would rise up to "promote" for a period, and then stop "promoting" in another period, even going in the opposite direction and joining the ranks of "regressives." Among bourgeois revolutionaries, such figures are countless. Communists are fundamentally different from these figures. We are the most thorough promoters, the eternal promoters. We fight for a certain urgent demand of the masses in a certain period, but we do not take the realization of this demand as the ultimate goal. Once a demand is realized, we immediately fight for the next demand. For example, after the task of national liberation was achieved, the task of completing land reform throughout the country was immediately put forward; after the task of land reform was completed nationwide, the task of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas was put forward; after the task of agricultural collectivization was achieved, the tasks of joint state-private operation of capitalist industry and commerce and the collectivization of handicrafts were also achieved, that is to say, the task of changing the ownership of the means of production was basically achieved. However, the task of the socialist revolution did not end there. The Chinese Communist Party then put forward the task of continuing the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; and on the basis of the great victory of this revolution, the Party put forward an even more ambitious task, which is to implement the General Line of socialist Construction and build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture as soon as possible. Productivity is always developing, and society is always advancing, so we should always do the work of promotion, and always be promoters. We often say "carry the revolution through to the end," but in fact, as far as the eternal development of society is concerned, there is no such thing as an end to revolution. Therefore, the work of promotion can never be stopped.

Now, our country's socialist revolution has been basically completed, and socialist construction has also achieved great victories throughout the country. The situation is very good. Is it still necessary to emphasize the issue of "being a promoter" at this time? It is still necessary. Right-leaning opportunists are regressives. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, they have been spreading gloomy winds and blowing cold air, everywhere discouraging and slacking off, opposing the Great Leap Forward, opposing the People's Communes, and opposing the General Line. This is a concrete manifestation of the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and this struggle will also be reflected as a struggle within the Party. This struggle will continue, even for decades, until classes are completely eliminated. In order to defeat the regressives, we should advocate that everyone always be a promoter.

In actual work, the promotion or regression of leadership is of great importance. Taking the speed of socialist construction (which is also revolution) as an example, under certain conditions of time, place, and other factors, this speed has a limit. For example, we cannot set the task of producing 100 million tons of steel in 1959. However, differences in the degree of subjective effort can, on a certain basis, cause a great difference in the results of production—the actual growth rate of production. If we make active efforts subjectively, we are very confident that this year's steel production will exceed 12 million tons; if we slacken off subjectively, this target may not be reached. The objective conditions in 1958 were not much different from those in other years, but the rate of production growth was much greater. The objective conditions in August and September of this year were not much different from those in June and July, but industrial production increased particularly. The poor machines and equipment of a factory can limit the rate of production growth, but people's subjective efforts can improve machines and equipment and increase their efficiency. Low-lying terrain, prone to flooding, this unfavorable condition can affect agricultural production; but through subjective efforts, people can change the terrain, eliminate flooding, turn waterlogged land into fertile fields, and accelerate the growth of agricultural products.

Countless facts prove that our cause can advance at a high speed, and can be done both quickly, well, and economically, not, as some people say, only slowly, or that if you want to be fast, you cannot be good and economical. The key to the problem lies in the leadership: is it the leadership of promoters or the leadership of regressives? We cannot infinitely exaggerate the role of subjectivity and become subjectivists, utopians, and idealists. We must respect the objective laws and objective conditions of things, and we must respect science. However, we should not lie on objective laws and objective conditions and be their slaves. Man is not a general object. People can recognize and master objective laws and use them to serve themselves and accelerate the development of history. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Those who direct the war cannot seek victory in war beyond the limits permitted by objective conditions, but they can and must actively strive for victory in war within the limits of objective conditions." He also said: "Objective factors possess the possibility of this change (referring to the change in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves), but the realization of this possibility requires correct policies and subjective efforts. At this time, the subjective role is decisive." (Both are from "On Protracted War")

One of the fundamental differences between promoters and right-leaning opportunists lies here. The leadership of the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has always attached great importance to mobilizing all positive factors, giving full play to people's subjective initiative and the potential of all aspects, and limiting the scope of unfavorable conditions. This is to attach importance to taking active measures within the limits permitted by objective conditions to actively promote the development of the cause. The Chinese people have been able to quickly overthrow the reactionary rule of domestic and foreign enemies, achieve great victories in national democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and quickly achieve significant achievements in socialist construction. Especially in achieving an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1958, and continuing to leap forward this year, all these are inseparable from the correct leadership and active promotion of the Party Central Committee. If we succumb to objective conditions like right-leaning opportunists and adopt their policies of not promoting but regressing, then there would absolutely be no Great Leap Forward last year and the continued leap forward this year. This slow-moving approach will inevitably prolong China's poverty and backwardness, placing itself in a tragic position of being constantly beaten and passive, unable to control its own destiny.

How to be a promoter? One of the most important signs of a promoter is to adopt a positive attitude of support and promotion towards the revolutionary mass movement. Marxism recognizes that the masses are the masters and creators of history, and that history is the history of the people's masses themselves. A true revolution must be a conscious movement of the broad masses, and should not and cannot be created by a few heroic figures. Based on this fundamental understanding, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin all warmly praised the revolutionary movement of the people's masses. Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, has always been an enthusiastic supporter and advocate of the mass revolutionary movement, so he is also a model of a promoter. More than thirty years ago, when the Hunan peasant movement was surging and developing, knocking the feudal reactionary forces in the vast countryside to the ground and stepping on them, many people shouted "Terrible!", and even very revolutionary people could not deny the word "terrible"; Comrade Mao Zedong shouted out the voice of a true revolutionary promoter: "It's very good." The Chinese people's ability to rapidly develop and organize into a powerful revolutionary force is inseparable from the active leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Since liberation, our country has been able to very quickly solve the legacy tasks of the democratic revolution—land reform in rural areas and democratic reforms in cities, etc., effectively suppress counter-revolutionaries, eliminate the long-term bad habits of corruption and bribery formed in old China, and even smoothly solve the task of socialist transformation of the national economy, launching a surging high tide of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy since last year, all of which have been achieved by constantly launching and organizing large-scale mass movements.

In contrast, right-leaning opportunists do not actively support, lead, and promote the revolutionary mass movement, but passively draw circles and set frameworks for the movement, restricting the scale and depth of the movement, fearing that the movement will step beyond the bounds, causing a little trouble, and destroying some old order and unreasonable rules and regulations. Some of them openly oppose the mass movement, pouring cold water on the movement, believing that the masses have no knowledge, cannot understand and master the Party's policies, and that the masses' actions can only mess things up. Even if they can achieve a little success, it can only be "not worth the loss." Because they cannot see the strength and wisdom of the broad masses, they certainly cannot see the possibility of high-speed development of the socialist cause. They feel that things were like this in the past, and they can only be like this in the future. The average annual growth in the past was a few percent, and it will always only be a few percent in the future, and it cannot be more than ten or tens of percent. They do not regard the speed of a few percent as a historical phenomenon, that is, a point in the process of historical development, and that the future will surpass this point and move forward; they seem to think that this speed is given by God, it has always been like this in the past, and it will always be like this in the future.

To be a revolutionary promoter, we must resolutely oppose this right-leaning opportunism that restricts and cancels the mass movement, clear obstacles for the mass movement, open up roads, so that the masses have the opportunity to display their creativity and complete their great historical mission.

Regarding some shortcomings and deviations in the mass movement, we must stand in the midst of the masses to observe, analyze the causes of their occurrence, study methods of overcoming them, and correct them realistically together with the masses, so that the movement can develop healthily and achieve satisfactory results. Rather than, like right-leaning opportunists, pointing fingers outside the masses, treating some shortcomings and deviations in the movement as a crime, attacking them; or seeing them as completely unsolvable problems, drawing pessimistic and desperate conclusions. As a revolutionary promoter, we must require ourselves to have the ideological and theoretical armament of dialectical materialism, so that we can see the essence in complex and chaotic phenomena, see the positive in the negative, and distinguish between the mainstream and the tributaries, nine fingers and one finger. When evil winds and evil spirits attack, they should be able to withstand them, stand firm, not be confused, not waver, and have a high degree of political firmness. This can be said to be a political test. If a person does not have political firmness, and he himself shakes in the storm, hesitates, how can he still "promote" others to advance, "promote" the development of the movement?

Our country is still in the transition period from capitalism to socialism. Classes still exist. We must be soberly aware that when the socialist revolution and socialist construction are advancing rapidly, when the General Line of socialist construction is implemented and the People's Commune movement is deepening, when it is necessary to finally end bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ownership and completely dig out the roots of rich peasants and the bourgeoisie, all anti-socialist forces will inevitably rise up to resist resolutely. This situation of class struggle will inevitably be reflected in the Party and the revolutionary ranks. This is not surprising at all. A small handful of right-leaning opportunists are regressives of the revolutionary cause and representatives of the remaining forces of the bourgeoisie. This struggle against Right opportunists is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the socialist revolution of the past decade. Every one of our Party members and cadres must stand firm in this struggle against right-leaning opportunism, draw a clear line in thinking, and resolutely defend the Party's General Line and our country's great socialist cause. This is our sacred duty, and no wavering is allowed.

In our country, the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will continue for a very long period. In this long, tortuous, and complex class struggle, every revolutionary should maintain a high degree of vigilance: will you be a promoter or a regressive? At the same time, the old social struggles cease, and new social struggles arise again. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: According to materialist dialectics, contradictions and struggles are eternal, otherwise it would not be the world. Bourgeois politicians say that the Communist Party's philosophy is the philosophy of struggle. That's right. However, the form of struggle varies according to the times. Therefore, a revolutionary cannot imagine that there is no struggle in society, that it is calm and peaceful. If there is no struggle, society cannot exist. Since there are two sides to the struggle: one side is new, and the other side is old; one side is positive, and the other side is negative; one side is correct, and the other side is wrong. Since there are two sides, you must always choose one side: are you standing on the new, positive, and correct side, or are you standing on the old, negative, and wrong side? This situation will exist for ten thousand years, but the nature and form of this struggle will be different in the classless society of the future and the class society of the present. As a revolutionary, at any time, we must be with the broad masses, we must enthusiastically protect the initiative and creativity of the broad masses, we must stand on the side of new things, and we must support and encourage the growth of new things. That is to say, we must always be promoters.

    永远做革命的促进派
    理文
    认真地学习一次党的八届八中全会的文件，是当前全党的一件重要事情。经过这次学习，要彻底批判和纠正一部分干部中的右倾思想和右倾情绪，揭露和克服某些人的右倾活动；要加深党员和干部对于总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的认识；对于社会主义建设时期阶级斗争规律和形势的认识；要从思想上更进一步划清无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的界线，划清无产阶级革命家同资产阶级革命家的界线，划清马克思主义者同一些“同路人”的界线，把全党的思想水平和党性锻炼提高一步。
    为了使这次学习更有成效，有必要重新提起并着重强调一下1958年大跃进时期毛泽东同志所一再倡导的一个口号，就是要全党同志永远做革命的促进派，而不要做促退派。
    为什么一定要做促进派呢？从老根子上说，共产党人所以进行革命，就是要让社会不断地向前发展，不断进步。因此，革命也就是“促”社会前进。历史上已经有过不知多少的革命家做过促进社会发展的工作。但他们却不能永远作促进派，往往是这个时期起来“促进”了一下，另一个时期就停止“促进”，甚至走向它的反面，站到“促退”的行列之中。在资产阶级革命家当中，这样的人物不胜枚举。共产党人和这些人物根本不同，我们是最彻底的促进派，是永远的促进派。我们在一定时期为群众的某一种迫切要求而斗争，但并不以实现这种要求为最终目的。一种要求实现了，紧接着就要为下一种要求而斗争。比如全国解放的任务实现了，紧接着就提出在全国范围内完成土地改革的任务；全国土地改革的任务实现了，又提出在农村发展互助合作运动的任务；农业合作化的任务实现了，紧接着资本主义工商业的公私合营的任务，手工业合作化的任务也实现了，就是说改变生产资料所有制方面的任务基本实现了。但是，社会主义革命的任务并没有就此结束，中国共产党又提出了在政治战线和思想战线上继续进行社会主义革命的任务；而在这一革命取得伟大胜利的基础上，党又提出了更加宏伟的任务，就是执行社会主义建设的总路线，把我国尽快地建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。生产力永远在发展，社会永远在前进，就应当永远作促进的工作，永远作促进派。我们常说“把革命进行到底”，其实就社会永远在发展这一点来说，革命是无所谓底的，因此，促进工作也是永远不能停止的。
    现在，我国的社会主义革命已经基本完成，社会主义建设也在全国范围内取得巨大胜利，形势非常好，这时候还有没有必要强调“当促进派”这样的问题呢？还是有必要的。右倾机会主义分子就是促退派，他们从去年大跃进以来，就在散阴风吹冷气，处处泄气松劲，反对大跃进、反对人民公社、反对总路线。这是资产阶级同无产阶级进行的阶级斗争的一种具体表现，而且这一斗争还会反映成党内的斗争。这种斗争还要继续下去，甚至会继续几十年，直到阶级完全消灭。为了战胜促退派，就应当提倡大家永远当促进派。
    在实际工作中，领导上的促进或促退，关系甚为重大。拿社会主义建设（这也是革命）的速度来说，在一定的时间地点和其他条件之下，这个速度是有极限的。比方说，我们不能给1959年提出年产一亿吨钢的任务。但是，主观上努力程度的不同，可以在一定基础上，使生产的结果——生产的实际增长速度发生很大的差别。如果我们主观上积极努力，今年钢的产量就很有把握超过一千二百万吨；如果主观上松了劲，泄了气，这个指标就可能达不到。1958年的客观条件，同别的年度相比并无多大差别，但生产的增长速度却大得多。今年8、9月份的客观条件同6、7月份相比也无多大差别，但工业生产增长得特别多。一个工厂的机器和设备不好，能够限制生产的增长速度；但人的主观努力能够改善机器和设备，提高它们的功效。地势低洼，易遭涝灾，这个不利的条件能够影响农业增产；但人们经过主观努力，能够改变地形，消除涝灾，使涝地变成肥田，加快农产品的增长。
    无数的事实证明，我们的事业能够高速度前进，能够做得既多快，又好省，并不是像某些人说的只能慢慢来，或者要多快就不能好省。问题的关键，在于领导：是促进派的领导呢，还是促退派的领导。我们不能无限地夸大主观的作用，成为主观主义，空想主义，唯心主义者。我们必须尊重事物发展的客观规律、客观条件，必须尊重科学。但是，我们也不应当躺在客观规律和客观条件上，做它们的奴隶。人不是一般的物，人们能够认识和掌握客观规律，利用它们来为自己服务，加快历史的发展。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。”又说：“客观因素具备着这种变化（指敌我力量对比的变化）的可能性，但实现这种可能性，就需要正确的方针和主观的努力。这时候，主观作用是决定的了。”（均见“论持久战”）
    促进派和右倾机会主义者的根本分歧之一，也就在这里。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导，从来十分重视调动一切积极因素，充分发挥人的主观能动性和各方面的潜力，限制不利条件的作用范围。这就是重视在客观条件许可的限度内，采取积极的措施，能动地促进事业的发展。中国人民能够迅速地推翻国内外敌人的反动统治，取得民族民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，又在社会主义建设中很快地取得重大成就。尤其是在1958年中取得史无前例的国民经济大跃进，并且在今年继续跃进，这些，都是同党中央的正确领导和积极促进分不开的。如果像右倾机会主义者那样屈服于客观条件，采取他们那种不是促进、而是促退的方针，那就绝对不可能有去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进。这种慢腾腾的做法，必然会延长中国的贫穷落后状态，使自己经常处在挨打的被动的不能掌握自己命运的悲惨地位。
    怎样做一个促进派呢？促进派的最重要标志之一，是对革命的群众运动采取积极支持和促进的态度。马克思主义认定，群众是历史的主人和创造者，历史也就是人民群众自己的历史。真正的革命，一定是广大群众的自觉的运动，而不应当也不可能是少数英雄人物制造出来的。基于这种根本的理解，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林都热烈地歌颂过人民群众的革命运动。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，历来是群众革命运动的热烈支持者和倡导者，因此他也就是促进派的典范。三十多年以前，当湖南农民运动风起云涌地发展起来，把广大农村的封建反动势力打翻在地，又踏上一只脚的时候，许多人都大叫“糟得很”，连很革命的人也不能否认一个糟字；毛泽东同志则大声喊出了真正的革命促进派的声音：“好得很”。中国人民能够迅速地发展和组织成为强大的革命力量，是同毛泽东同志为首的党中央的积极领导分不开的。解放以来，我们国家能够非常迅速地解决民主革命的遗留任务——农村的土地改革和城市的民主改革等，有成效地镇压反革命分子，革除旧中国长时期形成的贪污行贿等恶劣风气，一直到顺利地解决国民经济社会主义改造的任务，在全国展开社会主义建设，掀起去年以来排山倒海的国民经济大跃进的高潮，所有这些，都是不断地发动和组织大规模的群众运动才达到的。
    右倾机会主义分子与此相反，他们对革命的群众运动不是积极支持、领导和促进，而是消极地给运动划圈圈，摆框框，限制运动的规模和深度，生怕运动会越出雷池一步，发生一点什么乱子，冲毁一点旧的秩序和不合理的规章制度。他们中间的有些人是明火执仗地反对群众运动，给运动泼冷水，认为群众没有知识，不能了解和掌握党的政策，群众行动起来只能把事情搞乱搞坏。即使能搞出一点成绩，也只能是“得不偿失”。因为看不见广大群众的力量和智慧，他们当然也就看不出社会主义事业高速发展的可能。他们觉得事情原来是怎么样，将来也只能是怎么样。过去每年平均增长百分之几，以后也就永远只能是百分之几，而不可能是百分之十几或几十。对于百分之几这个速度，他们不认为是历史的现象，即历史发展进程中的一点，将来历史会越过这一点奔向前去；他们似乎认为这个速度是上帝所赐与，过去从来如此，将来也永远如此。
    做一个革命的促进派，必须坚决反对这种限制和取消群众运动的右倾机会主义，为群众运动扫除障碍，开辟道路，使群众有机会施展他们的创造力，完成他们伟大的历史使命。
    对于群众运动中的一些缺点和偏向，必须站在群众中间来观察，分析它们发生的原因，研究克服的办法，同群众一起实事求是地加以纠正，使运动得以健康地发展，得到完满的结果。而不是像右倾机会主义分子那样站在群众的外面指手划脚，把运动中的一些缺点和偏向当成一种罪状，进行攻击；或者看成完全不能解决的问题，得出悲观绝望的结论。做为一个革命的促进派，必须要求自己有辩证唯物主义的思想和理论武装，使自己能够在复杂纷乱的现象中看到本质，能够透过消极的东西看到积极的东西，能够分清主流和支流，九个指头和一个指头。在妖风邪气袭来的时候，他们应当能够顶得住，站得牢，不迷惑，不摇晃，有一种高度的政治坚定性。这可以说是政治上的考验。一个人如果没有政治坚定性，在风浪中自己先动摇起来，犹疑不前，怎么还能“促”别人前进，“促”运动发展？
    我国现在还处于由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。阶级依然存在。我们必须清醒地意识到当着社会主义革命和社会主义建设飞速向前，当着社会主义建设总路线的贯彻和人民公社化运动日益深入，要最后结束资产阶级和小资产阶级所有制，要彻底挖掉富裕中农和资产阶级的根子的时候，一切反社会主义的力量，必然要起来坚决抵抗。这种阶级斗争的情况也必然会反映到党内和革命队伍中来。这是丝毫不奇怪的。一小撮右倾机会主义分子，是革命事业的促退派，是资产阶级残余力量的代表人。这一场反对右倾机会主义的斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级的生死斗争的继续。我们每一个党员和干部，在这次反对右倾机会主义的斗争中要站稳立场，划清思想界限，坚决地保卫党的总路线，保卫我国的伟大社会主义事业，这是我们的神圣职责，不容任何动摇。
    在我国，资产阶级和无产阶级的阶级斗争，还要继续一个很长的时期。在这种长期的、曲折的和复杂的阶级斗争中，我们每一个革命者都应当保持高度的警惕，是作一个促进派呢，还是作一个促退派呢？同时，旧的社会斗争止息了，新的社会斗争又起来。毛泽东同志指出：按照唯物辩证法，矛盾和斗争是永远的，否则不成其为世界。资产阶级的政治家，说共产党的哲学就是斗争哲学。一点也不错。不过，斗争形式，依时代不同而有所不同罢了。因此，一个革命者，不能幻想社会上没有任何斗争，风平浪静。如果没有斗争，社会也就不可能存在了。既然有斗争，就有两方面：一方面是新的，一方面是旧的；一方面是积极的，一方面是消极的；一方面是正确的，一方面是错误的。既有两方面，你总要选择一方面：你是站在新的、积极的、正确的方面呢，还是站在旧的、消极的、错误的方面呢？这种情况，一万年都是存在的，只不过在将来没有阶级的社会中和现在有阶级的社会中，这种斗争的性质和斗争的形式不同罢了。作为一个革命者，在任何时候都要同广大群众在一起，都要满腔热情地保护广大群众的积极性和创造性，都要站在新事物一方面，都要支持和鼓舞新生事物的成长。这就是说，要永远当促进派。
