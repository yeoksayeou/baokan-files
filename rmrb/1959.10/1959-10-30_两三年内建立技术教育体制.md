    Establishing a Technical Education System in Two to Three Years
    The reorganized education system will be: Kindergarten - Four-year People's School - Three-year Middle School - Two-year Technical School - Two-year Higher Technical School - Four to Five-year University and Four-year Graduate School. Implement the principle of combining theory and practice to cultivate well-rounded construction talents.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th. The Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea today passed a decree on reforming the people's education system.
    The decree stipulates that senior high schools will be abolished within two to three years, and a secondary technical education system that closely integrates general education and technical education will be established. This means expanding the existing two-year technical schools that admit junior high school graduates and establishing new two-year higher technical schools that admit graduates from these technical schools. From the 1962-1963 academic year, a nine-year technical compulsory education system will be implemented up to the technical school level. The reorganization of this education system will be fully completed within two to three years.
    The decree stipulates that from 1960 to 1965, each city and county should have one to two higher technical schools to prepare for the implementation of technical compulsory education.
    According to the decree, the reorganized education system will be: Kindergarten, four-year People's School, three-year Middle School, two-year Technical School, two-year Higher Technical School, four to five-year University and four-year Graduate School. In addition, efforts should be made to expand the education network of night schools, correspondence schools, and adult schools, strengthen work in this area, and make partial adjustments; strengthen the education of honored soldiers, children of martyrs, and orphans; and establish eleven-year music, dance, fine arts, and sports schools starting from the People's School. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the needs of the reorganized education system, a teacher training system will be established to cultivate a large number of teachers, especially technical education teachers.
    Korean Minister of Education and Culture, Li Il-gyong, delivered a lengthy report at the Supreme People's Assembly on the issue of reforming the people's education system. He pointed out that this reform of the education system is a historically significant measure to develop Korean people's education to a higher stage. It is a mature issue that meets the requirements of Korea's current development and is another great achievement of the Korean people in socialist construction.
    When talking about the achievements of Korea in developing education, he said that compulsory junior high school education has been implemented in northern Korea last year. Now there are 2.5 million students studying in more than 8,000 schools, including 37 universities. More than 500 technical schools have been built to prepare for the implementation of technical compulsory education, with more than 80,000 students studying in them. Schools at all levels have achieved brilliant success in implementing the Korean Workers' Party's educational policy of combining education with productive labor.
    He pointed out that Korea's people's economy has recently been developing rapidly by leaps and bounds. On the one hand, this provides a material guarantee for the development of people's education, and on the other hand, it requires people's education to improve its quality. Various economic sectors, factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives need a large number of well-rounded personnel with knowledge and modern production technology.
    He said that in the curriculum of the newly established technical schools, general education subjects occupy half of the time, and the remaining time is used to study technology and carry out production internships, and to closely integrate general subjects, technical subjects, and production internships, thoroughly implementing the principle of combining theory and practice. Graduates from technical schools will have the technical knowledge to independently participate in production activities and obtain a certain level of technician qualifications.
    He said that higher technical schools must also thoroughly implement the policy of combining education and productive labor. Graduates will learn independent production technologies in any department of modern production such as metallurgy, machinery, chemistry, and agriculture, and can obtain technician qualifications after graduation.
    He pointed out that through four years of study in technical schools and higher technical schools, students will learn general education that is no less than the current three-year high school level, and learn technology that is equivalent to the current technical school graduate level. In this way, the reorganized education system from kindergarten to university is an interconnected and organic system. Graduates from higher technical schools can participate in production and construction, and can also enter universities according to their wishes.
    He emphasized that the implementation of technical compulsory education and the establishment of higher technical schools in Korea is a brilliant policy of the Korean Workers' Party to educate future generations into well-rounded builders of socialism and communism, which has epoch-making significance in the development of Korean people's education.

    朝鲜最高人民会议通过改组教育体制法令
    两三年内建立技术教育体制
    改组后的教育体制将是：幼儿园——四年制人民学校——三年制中学校——二年制技术学校——二年制高等技术学校——四年至五年制的大学和四年制的研究院贯彻理论和实践结合原则培养全面发展的建设人材
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第六次会议今天通过一项关于改组人民教育体制的法令。
    这项法令规定，要在二、三年内废除高级中学，建立一般教育和技术教育密切结合的中等技术教育体制，这就是：要扩大现有的招收初中毕业生的二年制的技术学校，新设招收这种技术学校毕业生的二年制的高等技术学校，从1962—1963年学年度开始将实行一直到技术学校为止的九年制的技术义务教育制。这项教育体制的改组工作要在二、三年内全面完成。
    法令规定，从1960年到1965年，要达到每个市、郡有一至二所高等技术学校，为实现技术义务教育制作准备。
    根据法令，改组后的教育体制将是：幼儿园，四年制的人民学校，三年制的中学，二年制的技术学校，二年制的高等技术学校，四年至五年制的大学和四年制的研究院。另外，要大力扩大夜校、函授学校和成人学校教育网，加强这方面的工作，并且作部分的调整；加强对荣誉军人、烈士子女、孤儿等的教育工作；设立从人民学校开始的十一年制的音乐、舞蹈、造型艺术和体育学校。另外，为了适应改组后的教育体制的需要，要建立师范教育体制，培养大量的师资，特别是技术教育的师资。
    朝鲜教育文化相李一卿在最高人民会议上，就改组人民教育体制的问题作了长篇报告。他指出，这次教育体制的改组是使朝鲜人民教育发展到更高阶段的具有历史意义的措施，这是符合朝鲜现实发展要求的成熟了的问题，是朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的又一个巨大的成果。
    他谈到了朝鲜发展教育的成就时说，朝鲜北部已在去年实行了初中义务教育制，现在有二百五十万名学生在包括三十七所大学在内的八千多所学校中学习。为准备实行技术义务教育制而建设的技术学校已达到五百多所，共有八万多名学生在其中学习。各级学校贯彻朝鲜劳动党的教育和生产劳动相结合的教育方针已取得了辉煌的成就。
    他指出，朝鲜的人民经济最近在迅速地飞跃发展，这一方面从物质上保证了人民教育的发展，另一方面要求人民教育提高质量。各个经济部门、厂矿企业、农业社大量需要具有知识和现代化生产技术的全面发展的人员。
    他说，新设立的技术学校的课程中，一般教育科目占一半的时间，剩余的时间学习技术，进行生产实习，并且使一般科目、技术科目和生产实习紧密地联系在一起，彻底地实现理论和实践相结合的原则。从技术学校毕业的学生将具有能够独立参加生产活动的技术知识，并取得一定等级的技工资格。
    他说，高等技术学校也要彻底实行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，毕业生将学到冶金、机械、化学、农业等现代生产的任何一个部门的独立的生产技术，毕业后可取得技术员的资格。
    他指出，通过技术学校和高等技术学校的四年学业，学生们将学到不低于现在的三年制高中程度的普通教育，并学到等于现在的技术专科学校毕业生水平的技术。这样，改组后的从幼儿园到大学的教育体制是一个互相衔接的、有机的体制。从高等技术学校毕业的学生可以参加生产建设，也可以根据自己的希望升入大学。
    他强调说，在朝鲜实行技术义务教育制和设立高等技术学校，是朝鲜劳动党为了把后代教养成全面发展的社会主义、共产主义建设者的英明政策，这在朝鲜人民教育的发展中具有划时代的意义。
