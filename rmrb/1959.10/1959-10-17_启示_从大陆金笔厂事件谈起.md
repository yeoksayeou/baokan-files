　　From the Mainland Golden Pen Factory Incident
　　Wang Che
　　This still happened in April of this year.
　　Shanghai's various gold pen factories held their first quarter industry evaluation, and the Golden Star Gold Pen Factory won first place; this factory had a high pen nib output and the best quality.
　　The Mainland Golden Pen Factory's production wasn't doing so well, so workers went to the Golden Star Gold Pen Factory to visit. They discovered that the main technical reason for the Golden Star Gold Pen Factory's good production was the use of a mechanized device called a hexagonal tumbling barrel to grind pen nibs; and this hexagonal tumbling barrel was precisely what the Mainland Golden Pen Factory had created during the Great Leap Forward movement last year. However, the Mainland Golden Pen Factory no longer used this thing.
　　What was going on? Had the hexagonal tumbling barrel failed at the Mainland Golden Pen Factory? No. After the Mainland Golden Pen Factory used this device, one worker's daily output increased from more than six hundred nibs during manual operation to more than three thousand nibs. – This number is very large. Of course, on the other hand, a small problem arose, which was that the quality was a little worse. In early April, the entire factory began to focus on quality, and this issue was raised. What to do? The head of the technical inspection section believed that with such a high output, the quality would inevitably be problematic, and to ensure quality, meticulous work was required, and manual operation was more precise than this tumbling barrel. This opinion was agreed upon by the factory director, so the factory decided to stop using the hexagonal tumbling barrel and return to manual operation.
　　This decision greatly surprised the workers, who said: The leadership simply issued an order forbidding its use, without explaining why? If the hexagonal tumbling barrel has shortcomings, they should discuss it with us and find ways to improve it. Some workers said angrily: Last year, production couldn't go up, we worked day and night on technical revolution, and the technical staff didn't help us think of solutions at all; now that quality is being emphasized, they come out and point fingers, saying that this won't work, that won't work.
　　Although the workers talked a lot, the decision was still implemented. What was the result? The pen nib output (per person per day) suddenly plummeted from more than three thousand to more than five hundred, while the quality did not improve significantly.
　　Was it that the quality would definitely be bad after using the hexagonal tumbling barrel? Not at all. The workers at the Mainland Golden Pen Factory studied the experience of the Golden Star Gold Pen Factory and discovered the problems with their own hexagonal tumbling barrel: First, the hexagonal tumbling barrel was made too rough and too large, and the ground pen nibs were prone to burrs; second, the finishing work before the pen nibs entered the barrel was relatively rough, and there was a lack of individual responsibility system; third, the output was raised too high, exceeding the actual limit that the hexagonal tumbling barrel could normally achieve. In this way, after returning to the factory, they improved the hexagonal tumbling barrel according to the characteristics of the factory and established a personal responsibility system.
　　After this struggle by the workers, this excellent creation from last year's Great Leap Forward became more complete, both high-yielding and high-quality, fully meeting the requirements of the General Line. Now, the daily output of grinding pen nibs has recovered from five hundred to one thousand five hundred to two thousand, and the qualification rate has increased from 50% during manual operation to 97%.
　　The factory's general branch secretary said: We have received another profound education.
　　The Mainland Golden Pen Factory incident is a typical example, and this example is very illustrative. In my opinion, it illustrates at least two issues: one is the issue of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the other is the issue of going all out.
　　Are we building socialism using the method of more, faster, better, and more economical, or are we using the method of less, slower, worse, and more wasteful? – The Party Central Committee is asking the question this way. But a few people actually disagree with asking the question this way. According to their thinking, the question should be asked this way: Is it more, faster, worse, and more wasteful, or is it less, slower, better, and more economical?
　　Some cadres at the Mainland Golden Pen Factory thought this way. In their view, to have more and faster, you can't have better and more economical, and to have better and more economical, you can't have more and faster. Why was the quality poor? Because too much was being produced too quickly. To emphasize quality, it was easy: go backwards, not more, not faster, only seeking quality.
　　We cannot deny that there is indeed a contradiction between quantity and quality in production practice. The sayings "Haste makes waste" and "Slow work produces fine results" reflect this contradiction. However, truth is concrete, and it is wrong to abstractly oppose quantity and quality, and not see the connection between the two. Sometimes, "Haste makes waste" and "Slow work produces fine results" are true; at other times, "Not haste makes waste" and "Fast work produces fine results" are true. The key issue lies in the specific conditions, in how the specific stipulations of so-called "haste" and "slow" are defined. If the "haste" of "Haste makes waste" exceeds objective possibility, if it is divorced from the constraints of better and more economical, then the result will indeed be "waste," but if it refers to the fastest speed that objective conditions allow, then the result will be "success." For those who are afflicted with acute illness and want to build socialism in one morning, they need to be told "Haste makes waste"; for those who are afflicted with chronic illness and walk like a bound-footed woman, they need to be told "Not haste makes waste." – And the main problem now lies in the latter.
　　One-sidedly emphasizing the contradiction between quantity and quality and denying the unity of the two, believing that quality cannot be improved without sacrificing quantity, or that quantity cannot be increased without sacrificing quality, is a view that violates the truth proven by all of history. From the entire history of production development, the progress of production technology is precisely the process of continuously improving both the quantity and quality of products at the same time. The so-called development of productive forces is the production of more and better products in the same amount of time. In the process of production development, the quantity and quality of products are constantly in contradiction, but these contradictions are always being overcome. For example: when a new and excellent product first comes out, the quantity is always relatively small, but as long as it is truly needed by society, after a period of time, it can always transition to mass production. In this process of increasing quantity, due to the accumulation of experience, product quality will also be improved. And later, an even better new product may appear, and then it will start from small-scale production to mass production again. This is one situation. Another situation is that due to the adoption of a certain new technology, the quantity of a certain product is first increased, but the quality is somewhat poor, and it is only after improvement that the quality is also improved.
　　Taking the example of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory, the output of three thousand pieces per person per day did affect the quality, which means that this specific high quantity could not be unified with qualified quality, but after reducing the output to less than two thousand pieces, it no longer affected the quality. It can be seen that under certain conditions, there is a limit to the unification of specific quantity and specific quality. For the current production conditions of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory, this limit is two thousand pieces. But this limit is not absolute, and if the conditions change, the limit can be broken. It is believable that in the future, the workers will definitely have new improvement methods to continue to improve both output and quality. At that time, there will be a unification of higher output and higher quality.
　　In the final analysis, our method of building socialism is either more, faster, better, and more economical, or less, slower, worse, and more wasteful. Even if the phenomena of "more, faster, worse, and more wasteful" and "less, slower, better, and more economical" seem to appear temporarily, they cannot last long, because "worse and more wasteful" hinder "more and faster," and "less and slower" hinder "better and more economical." Some leading cadres of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory, seeing that "more, faster, and worse" wouldn't work, wanted to switch to "less, slower, and better," but in the end, they still ended up with "less, slower, and worse." Under the support of the Party branch, the workers of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory strived to move forward and turned "more, faster, and worse" into "more, faster, and better." Of course, needless to say, in terms of calculating costs, the former is also "wasteful," and the latter is also "economical."
　　The example of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory also illustrates how we should treat new things, and illustrates that "morale" must not be dampened. Certain leading cadres of the Mainland Golden Pen Factory poured cold water on the workers' creative enthusiasm, and the production of gold pens declined; the Party General Branch understood the workers' opinions, supported the workers' demands, criticized the technical inspection section for adopting a simply negative attitude towards the workers' creations during the Great Leap Forward, and after correcting the error, the quantity and quality of gold pens greatly increased again.
　　If you don't believe in more, faster, better, and more economical, you can't go all out; if you don't go all out, you can't achieve more, faster, better, and more economical.
　　Revolution requires a surge of morale. What is "morale"? The "辞海" (Dictionary) explains it as: "The breath that goes in and out." If a person's "breath is weak," then they must be sick; if they stop breathing, then they become a dead person. "Youthful vigor" indicates that young people have strong vitality, so they are rich in creative enthusiasm and enterprising spirit. When people inhale air, it creates oxidation in the body, generating heat energy, enabling people to labor and work, so it is called "strength." With morale, there is strength, great morale, great strength, athletes have large lung capacity, so they also have great strength. We also usually say "ambition," "ambition" is the goal, "morale" is the drive and perseverance. With "ambition," we also need "morale." Mencius said: "Ambition is the commander of morale." Our ambition is socialism and communism, as long as this great ambition is once established, it will play an extremely encouraging and mobilizing role, arousing all the "morale" within our bodies to fight for this "ambition." Right-leaning opportunists oppose putting politics in command, so what do they want to put in command? As long as a person is alive, as long as they have a breath, they will still have "ambition," that is, they will still have a goal in life, if not the ambition of communism, then the ambition of bourgeois individualism. What we mean by putting politics in command is to use the "ambition" of communism to arouse the overwhelming "morale" of the masses. Of course, relying solely on a surge of "morale" is not enough, but as long as we can make good use of objective laws, we can fully exert the role of "morale" on this basis.
　　"The shape of things that are first born must be ugly," the predecessor of the butterfly is a caterpillar, the swan is mistaken for an ugly duckling when it is first born, and Xi Shi in swaddling clothes would not necessarily have been very good-looking. The important point is not that it still has shortcomings now, that it is not beautiful enough, the important point is that it is more beautiful than old and declining things, that it has vitality, that in development it will overcome those shortcomings and become more and more beautiful. This is true from large things such as the socialist system, the People's Commune, etc., to small things such as an invention or creation.
　　During last year's Great Leap Forward movement, many new things emerged. This year, a gust of adverse wind blew, and some people talked a lot, saying that this wouldn't work, that wasn't good: the People's Commune? – A mess! Greatly developing steel? – Petty-bourgeois frenzy! Then the Great Leap Forward? – Nothing of the sort, all exaggeration! When the masses advanced with an overwhelming momentum last year, the "morale" of these people was stifled in their stomachs, but now it has "risen sharply." However, this is possession by evil spirits, not a healthy sign.
　　We must boost morale, and imperialism must also boost morale, but imperialism is already "gasping for breath," and can't boost much morale even if it tries, so they desperately want to extinguish our ambition. At this time, right-leaning opportunists come to dampen their own morale, shouldn't this be a moment for deep reflection?
　　China's six hundred and fifty million people, with the exception of a very small number of reactionaries, bourgeois rightists, and so on, are mostly "comrades" – with the same ambition for socialism, with the same ambition for communism. We are like-minded, and this "道" (way) is the General Line. With a common "ambition," with the correct "way," and with a "morale" that swallows the sun and the moon and strengthens the mountains and rivers, we will be invincible.

　　启示
　　从大陆金笔厂事件谈起
　　王彻
    这还是今年4月份的事。
    上海各金笔厂举行第一季度行业评比，金星金笔厂得了第一；这个厂笔尖产量高，质量也最好。
    大陆金笔厂的生产搞得不够好，工人就到金星金笔厂去参观。他们发现，金星金笔厂生产搞得好的主要技术原因，就是使用了一种叫做六角滚桶的磨笔尖的机械化装置；而这种六角滚桶正是大陆金笔厂在去年大跃进运动中创造的。可是，大陆金笔厂已不用这种东西了。
    这是怎么回事？六角滚桶在大陆金笔厂失败了么？没有。大陆金笔厂使用了这种装置以后，一个工人一天的产量从手工操作时的六百多只提高到三千多只。——这个数字是很大的。当然，另一方面也产生了一点问题，就是质量差了些。4月初，全厂开始大抓质量，就把这个问题提出来了。怎么办？技术检查科科长认为，产量这样高，质量总归有问题，要保证质量就得精工细作，手工操作比这个滚桶总要精细些。他这个意见得到了厂长的同意，于是厂方就决定停止使用六角滚桶，恢复手工操作。
    这个决定使工人大吃一惊，他们说：领导上简单地下个命令不准用，也说不出个为什么？如果六角滚桶有缺点，也该同我们商量商量，想办法改进呀。有些工人气忿地说：去年产量上不去，我们白天黑夜搞技术革命，技术人员一点也没有帮助我们想办法；现在一抓质量，他们就出来指手划脚，说这也不行，那也不行了。
    虽然工人们议论纷纷，但决定还是执行了。结果是怎样呢？笔尖产量（每人每天）一下子就从三千多只猛降到五百多只，而质量并没有显著改进。
    是不是使用了六角滚桶以后质量就一定不好呢？并不。大陆金笔厂的工人研究了金星金笔厂的经验，发现了自己使用的六角滚桶的毛病：一是六角滚桶做得太粗太大，磨过的笔尖容易起毛；其次是笔尖进桶前的整修工作比较粗糙，而且缺乏个人负责制；再次是产量提得过高，超过了六角滚桶正常工作实际所能达到的限度。这样，他们回厂以后，就根据本厂特点改进了六角滚桶，建立了个人责任制。
    经过工人们这一番斗争，去年大跃进中这一项出色的创造，更加完整了，既高产又优质，完全符合总路线的要求。现在，磨笔尖的日产量又从五百只恢复到一千五百至两千只，合格率从手工操作时的50％上升到97％。
    这个厂的总支书记说：我们又受到了一次深刻的教育。
    大陆金笔厂的事件是一个典型的例子，这个例子很能说明问题。据我看，它至少说明了两个问题：一是多快好省的问题，一是鼓足干劲的问题。
    我们建设社会主义是采取多快好省的方法呢，还是采取少慢差费的方法呢？——党中央是这样提问题的。但是有少数人实际上是不同意这样提问题的，按照他们的思想，问题应当是这样的提法：是多快差费呢，还是少慢好省呢？
    大陆金笔厂一部分干部就是这样想的。照他们看，要多快就不能好省，要好省就不能多快。质量为什么差了呢？就因为生产得太多太快了。要强调质量么，很好办，倒退回去，不多不快，只求质量。
    我们不能否认在生产实践中确实存在着数量和质量的矛盾。“欲速则不达”“慢工出细活”这些说法就反映了这种矛盾。可是，真理是具体的，把数量和质量抽象地对立起来，不看到两者的联系，是错误的。在有的时候，“欲速则不达”“慢工出细活”是真理；在另外的时候，“不速则不达”“快工出细活”是真理。关键问题就在具体条件，就在所谓“速”“慢”的具体规定如何。“欲速”的“速”，如果超过了客观可能性，如果是脱离了好和省的制约，那结果的确会“不达”，但如果是指客观条件允许的最快速度，那结果就是“达”。对于那害了急性病，想在一个早上建成社会主义的人，需要告诉他“欲速则不达”；对于那害了慢性病，像小脚女人摇摇摆摆走路的人，就需要告诉他“不速则不达”。——而现在的主要问题正是在后者。
    片面强调数量和质量的矛盾而否认两者的统一，认为不牺牲数量就不能提高质量，或不牺牲质量就不能提高数量，这种看法是违反了全部历史所证明了的真理的。从整个生产发展史看，生产技术的进步，恰恰就是生产品的数量和质量不断同时提高的过程。所谓生产力的发展，就是用同样多的时间，生产出更多更好的产品来。在生产发展过程中，产品的数量和质量是不断发生矛盾的，但这些矛盾又总是不断被克服的。比如：一种优良的新产品刚出来时，数量总是比较少的，但只要它真正为社会所需要，经过一段或长或短的时期后，它总能转入大量生产。在这个增加数量的过程中，由于积累了经验，产品质量也会得到改进。而以后，又可能有一种更好的新产品出现，于是又开始从少量生产发展到大量生产。这是一种情形。还有一种情形，就是由于采用了某种新技术，首先提高了某种产品的数量，但质量却差了些，只在经过改进以后才随着提高了质量。
    拿大陆金笔厂的例子说，每人每天三千只的产量，确实影响了质量，这就是说，这个具体的高数量还不能和合格的质量达到统一，但是，把产量降低到两千只以下以后，就不影响质量了。可见，在一定条件下，具体的数量要同具体的质量达到统一，是有一个限度的。对目前大陆金笔厂的生产条件来说，这个限度是两千只。但是这个限度并不是绝对的，条件改变了，限度也可以突破。可以相信，将来工人们一定能有新的改进办法，把产量和质量继续提高。那时，就会出现更高的产量和更高的质量的统一。
    归根结蒂说来，我们建设社会主义的方法，要么是多快好省，要么是少慢差费。即令暂时似乎出现“多快差费”和“少慢好省”的现象，也是不能长久的，因为“差费”妨碍着“多快”，“少慢”妨碍着“好省”。大陆金笔厂的某些领导干部，看到“多快差”不行，想换一个“少慢好”，但结果还是落得一个“少慢差”。大陆金笔厂的工人在党支部的支持下，力争上游，把“多快差”变成了“多快好”。当然，不消说，两种做法算起成本来，前者也是“费”的，后者也是“省”的。
    大陆金笔厂的例子，又说明了应当怎样对待新生事物，说明了“气”是泄不得的。大陆金笔厂某些领导干部对工人的创造热情泼了冷水，金笔的生产就下降了；党总支了解了工人的意见，支持了工人的要求，批评了技术检查科对待大跃进中工人的创造采取简单否定的态度，纠正了错误后，金笔的数量和质量又大大上升了。
    不相信多快好省就不能鼓足干劲，不鼓足干劲就不能做到多快好省。
    革命需要有一股气。“气”是什么？“辞海”的解释说：“呼吸出入之息也。”一个人要是“气息微弱”，那一定是有病；如果断了气，那就成死人了。“少年气盛”，这表示少年人生命力强，所以他们富于创造热情和进取精神。人吸进了气，在体内起氧化作用，产生热能，使人能劳动，能工作，所以叫做“气力”。有气就有力，气大力也大，运动员肺活量大，所以力也大。我们平常又说“志气”，“志”是目标，“气”就是干劲和毅力。有了“志”，还要有“气”。孟子说：“夫志，气之帅也。”我们的志是社会主义和共产主义，只要这个大志一旦确立，就会起极大的鼓舞和动员的作用，把我们身体内部的全副“气”，都唤出来，为这个“志”奋斗。右倾机会主义分子反对政治挂帅，那他们要拿什么东西挂帅呢？人只要活着，只要有一口“气”，他就还会有“志”，也就是还会有生活的目标，不是共产主义之志，就是资产阶级个人主义之志。我们说的政治挂帅，就是用共产主义之“志”，来鼓起群众的排山倒海之“气”。当然，光凭一股“气”是不够的，但只要我们能好好利用客观规律，就能在这基础上充分发挥“气”的作用。
    “始生之物，其形必丑”，蝴蝶的前身是条毛毛虫，天鹅刚生下来时会被误认为丑小鸭，襁褓中的西施想来也未见得是很好看的。重要之点不在他现在还有缺点，还不够美，重要之点在他比老衰的事物美，有生命力，在发展中它会克服那些缺点，越长越美。大至于社会主义制度，人民公社等等，小至于一项发明创造，都是如此。
    去年大跃进运动中，涌现了许多新东西。今年刮了一阵逆风，有些人议论纷纷，这也不行，那也不好：人民公社么？——办糟了！大办钢铁么？——小资产阶级狂热！那么大跃进呢？——没有这回事，全是虚夸！发这些议论的人，在去年群众以排山倒海之气势前进的时候，他们的“气”是憋在肚子里的，现在却一下“气焰高涨”了。只是这是邪气附身，不是健康的征象。
    我们要鼓气，帝国主义也要鼓气，不过帝国主义已经是“气息奄奄”了，要鼓气也鼓不起多少来，于是他们就拼命要来灭我们的志气。这时候，右倾机会主义分子却来泄自己的气，这还不应当猛省么？
    中国六亿五千万人，除了极少数反动派、资产阶级右派分子等以外，绝大多数都是“同志”——同社会主义之志，同共产主义之志。我们是志同道合的，这“道”就是总路线。有了共同的“志”，有了正确的“道”，再鼓起吞日月，壮山河的“气”，我们就能无往不胜。
