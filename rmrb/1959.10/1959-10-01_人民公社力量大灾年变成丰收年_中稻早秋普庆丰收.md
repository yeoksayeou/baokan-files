Xinhua News Agency, 30th. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Ministry of Agriculture: mid-season rice in southern provinces and regions, and early autumn grain crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum in the Yellow River basin have generally achieved bumper harvests. This is a fruitful result of the people's communes in various regions overcoming severe natural disasters such as drought.

At present, the harvest of over 150 million mu of mid-season rice planted in thirteen provinces (regions, municipalities) including Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Yunnan, Hubei, and Guizhou has basically been completed. Judging from the threshing in various places, many counties and people's communes have increased mid-season rice production to varying degrees compared to last year, generally by 10% to 30%, and in some cases by more than 40%. The average per-mu yield of Yunnan Province's more than 15 million mu of mid-season rice is estimated to increase by nearly 30% compared to last year. In the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou, the average per-mu yield of over 920,000 mu of mid-season rice that has been inspected is 909 jin, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. The more than 4 million mu of mid-season rice in the western Sichuan Plain generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. Hunan Province's more than 17 million mu of mid-season rice has generally achieved a bumper harvest. As of September 18th, the province had overfulfilled the task of purchasing and storing mid-season rice. The total output of mid-season rice in the Huanggang area of Hubei Province increased by 24% compared to last year. In the Huaibei area of Anhui Province, which was previously considered unsuitable for rice cultivation, large areas of high-yield rice fields have emerged this year due to the implementation of river network development and the conversion of dry land into paddy fields. The 4,700 mu of mid-season rice in the Liulin People's Commune of Funan, after harvesting and threshing, has been verified to have an average per-mu yield of 1,164 jin, an increase of more than 100% compared to last year.

The harvest of approximately 130 million mu of early autumn grain crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum planted in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces has also basically been completed. In the process of harvesting and threshing, news of bumper harvests continues to pour in. The total output of Jiangsu Province's more than 16 million mu of early autumn crops increased by more than 70% compared to last year, and the average per-mu yield increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Shandong Province's more than 30 million mu of early autumn crops have all been harvested, and in Tancheng County, where threshing has basically been completed, the average per-mu yield of more than 340,000 mu of early autumn crops increased by more than 20% compared to last year. The more than 25 million mu of early autumn crops that have been harvested in Hebei Province generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The more than 18 million mu of early autumn crops in Henan Province generally increased compared to last year. This year, in harvesting mid-season rice and early autumn grain crops, all localities have generally carried out ideological mobilization, planned labor, livestock, and tools in a planned manner, and carried out harvesting in a timely and meticulous manner, in accordance with the "six goods" requirements put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which require good cutting, good threshing, good harvesting, good sales, good distribution, and good storage in the autumn harvest. Many people's communes in Hebei Province have adopted the method of establishing specialized teams for different processes such as cutting, pulling, threshing, and gleaning, implementing assembly line operations, tightening the connection of processes, speeding up the harvesting progress, and improving the harvesting quality. The Jinbei area of Shanxi Province has launched a fine harvesting movement of "three harvests and three threshings," that is, harvesting again and again, threshing again and again, and winnowing again and again, so the autumn harvest work has been done particularly well.

This year's bumper harvest of mid-season rice and early autumn crops in various regions is a victory for the Party's General Line and a result of the great power of the people's communes. It is particularly worth mentioning that: in July and August, when autumn-ripe crops were setting and filling, areas producing mid-season rice and early autumn grain crops suffered severe drought. The severity of the drought was similar to the six major droughts that occurred between 1928 and 1944. However, due to the fact that the people in various regions, under the leadership of the Party, established the idea that man can conquer nature, fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, and made full use of the large number of water conservancy projects built since the Great Leap Forward, they carried out timely drought resistance and irrigation, so that drought-affected crops generally grew well, thrived, and achieved a bumper harvest. Shandong Province's farmers praised the bumper harvest, saying: "The people's communes are powerful, transforming disaster years into years of abundance." (Attached picture)

    人民公社力量大灾年变成丰收年
    中稻早秋普庆丰收
    十三省市中稻登场许多公社增产百分之十至百分之四十河北山东江苏等省早秋作物收割完毕丰收喜报不断传来
    据新华社30日讯　记者从农业部获悉：南方各省、区的中稻和黄河流域的早秋玉米、谷子、高粱等粮食作物普遍丰收。这是各地人民公社战胜严重的干旱等自然灾害所取得的丰收硕果。
    目前，四川、湖南、江苏、安徽、云南、湖北、贵州等十三个省（区、市）种植的一亿五千多万亩中稻，已基本收割完毕。从各地收打脱粒的情况看，许多县和人民公社的中稻都比去年有不同程度的增产，一般增产10％到30％，高的增产40％以上。云南省一千五百多万亩中稻平均亩产量估计可比去年增产近三成。贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州经过验收的九十二万多亩中稻，平均亩产九百零九斤，比去年约增产三成。四川川西平原四百多万亩中稻一般都比去年增产一成到二成。湖南省一千七百多万亩中稻普遍获得了大丰收，到9月18日止，这个省已超额完成了中稻征购入库任务。湖北黄冈专区中稻总产量比去年增产二成四。安徽省淮北地区过去被人们认为是不能种植水稻的地区，由于实现了河网化，把旱地改成水地，今年种植的中稻出现了大面积的高额丰产田。阜南柳林人民公社四千七百多亩中稻，经过收打脱粒核实，平均亩产一千一百六十四斤，比去年增产一倍多。
    河北、河南、山东、江苏、安徽、四川、陕西、山西等省种植的一亿三千万亩左右玉米、谷子、高粱等早秋粮食作物，目前收割工作也已基本结束。在收打脱粒的过程中，丰收的喜报不断传来。江苏省一千六百多万亩早秋作物，总产量比去年增产七成以上，平均亩产比去年增产一成以上。山东省三千多万亩早秋作物全部收完，脱粒已基本完毕的郯城县，三十四万多亩早秋作物平均亩产量比去年增产二成以上。河北省已收的二千五百多万亩早秋作物，一般都比去年增产一成到二成。河南省一千八百万亩早秋作物普遍比去年增产。今年各地在收割中稻和早秋粮食作物中，都根据党的八届八中全会提出的在秋收中要作到割好、打好、收好、交售好、分配好、保管好的六好要求，普遍地进行了思想动员，有计划地安排了劳力、畜力和工具，适时、细致地进行收打。河北省许多人民公社采取按工序建立割、拉、打、拾不同的专业队，实行流水作业，使工序衔接得紧，加快了收割进度，提高了收割质量。山西晋北专区开展收完又收再收，打完又打再打，扬完又扬再扬的“三收三打”的细收细打运动，秋收工作做得特别好。
    今年各地中稻和早秋作物的大丰收，是党的总路线的胜利，是人民公社巨大威力的成果。值得特别一提的是：7、8月间正当秋熟作物结实、灌浆的时候，盛产中稻和早秋粮食作物的地区遭受到了严重的干旱，干旱的程度同1928到1944年间发生的六次大旱相似，但由于各地人民在党的领导下，树立人定胜天的思想，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，并充分利用大进跃以来兴修的大量水利工程，及时地进行抗旱抢灌，使受干旱的农作物一般生长良好，欣欣向荣，获得了大丰收。山东省农民歌颂大丰收道：“人民公社力量大，灾年变成丰收年。”（附图片）
