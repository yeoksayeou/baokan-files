Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Chairman Zhu De said at the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic today that the Chinese government and the Chinese people have always fully supported the German Democratic Republic's just struggle against West German militarism, for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and for the maintenance of European peace and security, and support the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and end the occupation regime in West Berlin.

Tonight's celebration was jointly held by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles at the CPPCC Auditorium.

Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Dong Biwu and others attended the celebration.

H. Matern, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, head of the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, and members of the delegation also attended today's meeting.

The CPPCC Auditorium was filled with joy today. Colorful flags fluttered in the wind at the entrance of the venue. Huge banners with "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" and "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people!" were hung in the center of the hall inside the gate and opposite the rostrum in the venue, respectively. Pots of asparagus and palm trees were arranged around the rostrum. The national flags of China and Germany, hanging in front of the silver-gray sky, symbolized the close friendship between the two brotherly countries.

At 7:40, Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, announced the opening of the meeting, and the band played the national anthems of Germany and China.

Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, warmly praised the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in all aspects in the past ten years in his speech. He said that the Chinese people are extremely happy and encouraged by these brilliant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction.

Zhu De said that the German Democratic Republic has unremittingly exposed the criminal activities of West German militarism and revanchism to the people of the world, which has played a great role in helping the people of all countries correctly understand the danger of the revival of West German militarism. The Chinese people fully support the German Democratic Republic's just struggle for the bright future of Germany and the maintenance of world peace, and firmly believe that the German people will win the final victory in this struggle.

When talking about the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third cosmic rocket and the establishment of an automatic interplanetary station orbiting the moon, Zhu De said that this marked the beginning of mankind's ascent to other planets and demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. He said that Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States was another major contribution made by the Soviet government to striving for the relaxation of international tensions and maintaining world peace.

In his speech, Zhu De stated that the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's proposal for comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and will work together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving countries and people in the world, to achieve comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

Zhu De said that the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic were born in the same year and month, respectively standing on the eastern and western fronts of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as two brotherly countries. The Chinese people and the German people have always had a deep friendship, and the Chinese people are determined to unite with the German Democratic Republic forever and advance side by side for our common great cause.

Chairman Zhu De's speech was repeatedly interrupted by storm-like applause.

Matern spoke amidst warm applause, saying that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in German history, was the result of the heroic Soviet army's victory over fascist rule, which was of world historical significance. It opened up a path for Germany to develop in a new, democratic, and anti-fascist direction. The working class, as a great national force, is able to accomplish its historical task, namely, to guide the masses of the people onto a path to rebuild Germany into a peaceful and democratic country; to realize in a part of Germany the world-changing ideal of the great sons of the German people, Marx and Engels, to establish a social system that forever eliminates exploitation and oppression.

Matern said that due to the imperialist occupying powers and the original German imperialist forces, West Germany is increasingly becoming a fortress against democratic development in the whole of Germany and Europe. But the enemies of the German people, domestic and foreign imperialists, have miscalculated the development of Germany, just as the enemies have miscalculated the development of the Far East and the development of the People's Republic of China. A handful of millionaires can no longer stop the historical wheel of progress towards socialism driven by millions of workers and peasants.

Matern then detailed the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the economic field over the past decade. Currently, the foundation of socialism has been established in a wide range of areas in the Republic, and it has become the fifth largest industrial power in Europe. He said that the German Democratic Republic, as a solid component of the socialist camp in the westernmost part, is developing and prospering day by day.

In his speech, Matern repeatedly pointed out that due to the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, due to the common struggle for peace and socialism, the friendship between the Chinese and German people is unbreakable.

He thanked the Chinese people for their continuous and effective assistance to the German Democratic Republic, especially for their support in the German people's struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Matern's speech repeatedly aroused warm applause from the audience.

Also on the rostrum today were Guo Moruo and Li Weihan, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chen Yi and Tan Zhenlin, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Shi Liang, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhu Kezhen, President of the Sino-German Friendship Association, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Lao She, Member of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Mayor of Beijing.

Also on the rostrum was Wang Dair, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China.

    首都庆祝德国人民的伟大节日
    朱德委员长说，中德两国在社会主义阵营的东西方前线为共同事业并肩前进
    马特恩第一副主席指出，敌人再也不能阻挡德国向社会主义前进的历史车轮
    新华社6日讯　朱德委员长今天在德意志民主共和国成立十周年庆祝大会上说，中国政府和中国人民一贯全力支持德意志民主共和国反对西德军国主义、争取在和平民主的基础上统一德国和维护欧洲和平与安全的正义斗争，支持苏联和德意志民主共和国所提出的缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的建议。
    今晚的庆祝大会是由中华人民共和国对外文化联络委员会、中华人民共和国德意志民主共和国友好协会、中华全国总工会、全国青联、全国妇联、中国文学艺术界联合会在政协礼堂联合举行的。
    党和国家领导人周恩来、朱德、董必武等出席了庆祝大会。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团第一副主席、德意志民主共和国党政代表团团长赫·马特恩和代表团团员也出席了今天的大会。
    政协礼堂今天喜气洋溢。会场入口处彩旗迎风飘扬，大门内的大厅中央和会场内的主席台对面分别悬着“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”和“中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”的巨幅标语。一盆盆文竹和棕榈树前后簇镶着主席台。银灰色的天幕前悬挂着的中德两国国旗，标志着两个兄弟国家的亲密友谊。
    七时四十分对外文委主任张奚若宣布大会开始后，乐队奏德中两国国歌。
    中共中央副主席、全国人民代表大会常委会委员长朱德在讲话中热情地赞扬了德意志民主共和国十年中在各方面所取得的伟大成就。他说，中国人民对德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设中所取得的这些辉煌成就感到莫大的欢欣鼓舞。
    朱德说，德意志民主共和国在世界人民面前不懈地揭露西德军国主义和复仇主义的罪恶活动，对于帮助各国人民正确地了解西德军国主义复活的危险性起了极大的作用。中国人民全力支持德意志民主共和国为争取德国的美好的未来和维护世界和平而进行的正义斗争，并且深信，德意志人民在这一斗争中，必将获得最后的胜利。
    朱德在谈到苏联成功地发射了第三枚宇宙火箭、建立了围绕月球飞行的自动行星际站时说，这标志着人类攀登其他星球的开端，显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。他说，赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，是苏联政府为争取缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平事业所作的又一次重大贡献。
    朱德在讲话时表示，中华人民共和国政府和中国人民完全支持苏联政府提出的全面的彻底的裁军建议，并且将同苏联和其他社会主义国家以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，为实现全面的彻底的裁军而奋斗。
    朱德说，中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是同年同月诞生分别矗立在以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的东方和西方的最前线上的两个兄弟国家。中国人民和德意志人民一向有着深厚的友谊，中国人民决心同德意志民主共和国永远团结在一起，为了我们共同的伟大事业并肩前进。
    朱德委员长的讲话一再被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    马特恩在热烈的掌声中讲话，他说，德意志民主共和国，德国历史上的第一个工农国家的建立，是由于英雄的苏联军队战胜了法西斯统治取得了世界历史性胜利的结果。它给德国开辟了一条向新的、民主的、反法西斯方向发展的道路。工人阶级作为伟大的民族力量，能够完成它的历史任务，即把人民群众引导走上一条把德国重建为一个和平、民主国家的道路；在德国的一部分实现德国人民伟大的儿子马克思和恩格斯建立一个永远消除剥削与压迫的社会制度的改变世界的理想。
    马特恩说，由于帝国主义占领国和原来的德国帝国主义势力使西德越来越成为全德和欧洲反对民主发展的堡垒。但是德国人民的敌人，本国和外国帝国主义者对德国的发展打错了算盘，正如敌人对远东的发展，对中华人民共和国的发展打错了算盘一样。一小撮百万富翁再也不能阻拦由千百万工人和农民所推动的向社会主义前进的历史车轮。
    马特恩接着详细叙述了德意志民主共和国十年来在经济上所取得的巨大成就。目前在共和国的广大范围内已经建立了社会主义的基础，它已经成为欧洲第五个工业强国。他说，德意志民主共和国作为社会主义阵营最西方的牢固组成部分，正在日益发展和繁荣。
    马特恩在讲话中一再指出，由于马克思列宁主义的共同思想，由于为和平与社会主义的共同斗争，中德两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。
    他感谢中国人民经常给予德意志民主共和国的有效援助，特别是对德国人民争取缔结对德和约的斗争中所给予的支持。
