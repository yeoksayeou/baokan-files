Xinhua News Agency, October 21st dispatch from Moscow, October 21st (TASS): The Soviet "New Times" magazine's editorial in its forty-third issue stated that raising the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations is an intolerable violation of the UN Charter. Putting the so-called "Tibet issue" on the General Assembly's agenda makes one consider the question: where are the planners of this provocative incident preparing to push the United Nations?

The editorial pointed out that arguing about China's sovereignty over Tibet is as unfounded as arguing about the United States' sovereignty over Texas.

Referring to the events that occurred in Tibet, the editorial wrote that there, the decadent and outdated attempted to compete with the new, and as a result, were defeated. The editorial continued that some in the United Nations are trying to force the organization to defend the decadent and oppose the new; to defend the barbaric, medieval remnants and oppose the buds of new life.

The magazine wrote that it is clear that the decadent in the United Nations are also trying to compete with the new, and the believers in the "Cold War" are trying to stubbornly defend their original positions and obstruct the further normalization of international relations.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Mr. de Velasco, Vice President of the Brazilian Socialist Party and a member of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, who was invited to visit China and attend the 10th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: "The Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and no other country should interfere. The United Nations has absolutely no right to discuss this issue."

This visit is his third visit to China. He said that during this visit he saw "the Chinese people making great efforts politically and economically."

Velasco said: "During my first visit to China in 1956, I was very concerned about the production and living conditions of agricultural production cooperatives. This time, I visited many people's communes in Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. My conclusion is: the establishment of people's communes is a natural result of the development of cooperatives."

Referring to the various slanders by reactionary Western newspapers against China's Great Leap Forward, Velasco said: "China's industrial and agricultural output has increased, and the Chinese people are eating better and living better. These are all facts. China's steel production has increased from more than 5 million tons in 1957 to 12 million tons this year. If it can be called a 'leap backward,' then I would like my country to have such a 'leap backward,' and I think Britain and the United States would also hope to have such a 'leap backward.'"

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 22nd: The Indonesian National News Agency today quoted some Indonesian members of parliament as saying that the United Nations has no right to discuss the "Tibet issue."

Zordi Gondokusumo of the Progressive Nationalist faction said that according to law, Tibet is China's internal affair; historically, Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times; politically, the Tibet incident was a conspiracy of certain counter-revolutionaries in Tibet colluding with counter-revolutionaries abroad. Therefore, whether from a legal, historical, or political point of view, it is wrong to discuss the "Tibet issue" in the United Nations.

Sirajuddin Abbas, chairman of the Islamic political party Perti Islamic Party and a member of parliament, said that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of any country. If the United Nations interferes in everything, the world will fall into chaos.

Matarogawa of the Indonesian Communist Party said that after the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet, Tibetan society changed and the Tibetan people gained happiness. He refuted the United States' slander that China violated basic human rights or humanity.

    苏联“新时代”谴责联合国讨论“西藏问题”
    冷战信徒力图阻挠国际关系正常化
    巴西和印度尼西亚议员指出联合国无权讨论“西藏问题”
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联“新时代”杂志第四十三期的社论写道，在联合国中提出所谓“西藏问题”就是对联合国宪章的不能容忍的违犯。把所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程就使人们要考虑这样一个问题：这种挑衅事件的策划者准备把联合国推向何处。
    社论指出，争论中国对西藏的主权问题如同争论美国对得克萨斯州的主权问题一样是没有根据的。
    在谈到西藏发生的事件时，社论写道，在那里，腐朽的、过了时的东西企图同新生事物较量，结果遭到了失败。社论继续写道，在联合国中有人竭力迫使这个机构来保卫腐朽的东西而反对新生事物；保卫野蛮的、中世纪残余而反对新生活的萌芽。
    杂志写道，显然，在联合国中腐朽的东西也企图同新生事物较量，“冷战”的信徒们企图死守原来的立场，阻挠国际关系的进一步正常化。
    据新华社22日讯　应邀来我国访问并参加建国十周年庆祝典礼的巴西社会党副主席、巴西众议员德·维拉斯科告诉新华社记者说：“西藏问题是中国的内政，任何其他国家都不应干涉。联合国根本无权讨论这个问题。”
    这次访问是他的第三次访问中国。他说，他在这次访问中看到“中国人民在政治上和经济上都作出了巨大的努力”。
    维拉斯科说：“在1956年我第一次访问中国时，我就非常关心农业生产合作社的生产和生活面貌，这一次我又参观了北京、武汉、广州的很多人民公社。我的结论是：人民公社的建立是合作社自然发展的结果。”
    在谈到反动的西方报纸对中国大跃进的种种诬蔑时，维拉斯科说：“中国的工农业产量增加了，中国人民吃得更好、住得更好了，这一切都是事实。中国钢产量从1957年的五百多万吨上升到今年的一千二百万吨，如果它可以称作‘跃退’的话，那我愿意我国也有这样的‘跃退’，我想英、美也都会希望有这样的‘跃退’的。”
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚民族通讯社今天援引一些印度尼西亚国会议员的话说，联合国没有权利讨论“西藏问题”。
    进步民族系的佐迪·龚多古苏莫说，按法律，西藏是中国的内政；从历史上来说，西藏自古以来一直是中国的领土；从政治上来说，西藏事件是西藏某些反革命分子同在国外的反革命分子互相勾结的阴谋。因此，无论从法律、历史或政治的观点来看，在联合国中讨论“西藏问题”都是不对的。
    伊斯兰教政党白尔蒂伊斯兰党主席和国会议员西拉朱丁·阿巴斯说，联合国没有权利干涉任何国家的内政。如果联合国什么事情都干涉，世界将陷于混乱。
    印度尼西亚共产党的马塔洛加瓦说，在西藏叛乱平息之后，西藏社会发生了变化，西藏人民获得了幸福。他驳斥了美国所谓中国违反基本人权或人道的谰言。
