　　Power Line Carrier Machine
　　——"The Nervous System of the Power Grid"
    This newspaper reports that recently, the Nanjing Radio Factory has independently designed and manufactured China's first single-sideband composite power line carrier machine. The main purpose of this carrier machine is: to use high-voltage power transmission lines to transmit telephone and remote control, telemetry signals. It can also be used by the power sector to specifically adjust the power grid's workload. People call it the "nervous system of the power grid." It is a communication tool urgently needed by the power industry, including a high-frequency telephone channel and four audio remote control, telemetry channels. Through the carrier machine, two pairs of people can talk simultaneously on a pair of high-voltage transmission lines below 220,000 volts without interference, and four telegraph lines can also be connected simultaneously. All the components of the power line carrier machine are manufactured domestically.

　　电力载波机
　　——“电力网的神经系统”
    本报讯　最近，南京有线电厂自行设计制造了我国第一套单边带复合电力载波机。这种载波机的主要用途是：利用高压输电线传输电话和遥远控制、遥测讯号。还可以供电力部门专门调整电力网工作负荷之用，人们称它为“电力网的神经系统”。它是一种电力工业迫切需要的通讯工具，包括一个高频电话通路和四个音频遥远控制、遥远测量通路。通过载波机能使两对人同时在一对二十二万伏特以下高压输电线上讲话，声音互不干扰，并且同时可通四路电报。电力载波机的机件全部是国内自行制造的。
