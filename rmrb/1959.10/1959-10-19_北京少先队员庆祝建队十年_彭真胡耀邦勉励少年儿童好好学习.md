Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The magnificent Great Hall of the People became a world of joy for children today. More than 17,000 "Red Scarves" and Young Pioneer instructors from the capital gathered here to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers in Beijing. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Beijing, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and others attended the meeting.

The twelve-year-old chairman—Young Pioneer Tang Jingshen—announced the opening of the meeting. Accompanied by the crisp drum and bugle sounds of the children's band, the Young Pioneers, holding high twenty team flags, marched towards the rostrum. Then, fifty Young Pioneers collectively recited a poem celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Young Pioneers: "The First Decade." They recited excitedly:

　　The Party is even closer than parents,
　　Nurturing our growth,
　　We firmly follow the Party's lead,
　　Listening attentively to the Party's words.
　　Without the Party,
　　Everything of the past ten years would be an illusion!

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke to the enthusiastic applause of the children. He first congratulated the Young Pioneers on their tenth anniversary. He said: "Just now, your recited poem asked: What will you do in another ten years? Become standard bearers for socialist construction, become standard bearers for communism. Young Pioneers must study, study hard, train well to serve the people wholeheartedly, to serve socialism, to serve communism, study well, train well the strong will and ability to defend socialism, defend communism, defend the motherland and the people; whoever harms our motherland and socialism, opposes communism, opposes the Party and opposes the people, you must oppose them, overthrow them." At this time, thunderous applause erupted from the audience, expressing the children's great determination and will. In conclusion, Peng Zhen encouraged all Young Pioneers, under the leadership of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the Youth League, to study knowledge and skills well, and to train themselves well in work, labor, and sports to become socialist standard bearers, communist standard bearers, and good sons and daughters of the motherland and the Party.

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, extended greetings to the children on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. He said: "The Young Pioneers are a reserve force actively preparing for the construction of socialism and communism. You should think this way: Now I am a child, soon I will grow into an adult; today I am a reserve team member for the construction of socialism and communism, tomorrow I should become a shock team member for the construction of socialism and communism, and the day after tomorrow I should become a vanguard team member for the construction of socialism and communism. Your current task is to, as the Party and Chairman Mao have called on you to: study hard and make progress every day. First, you should study knowledge. Second, you should learn to work. Third, you should learn the communist spirit of serving the people." At the end of his speech, he asked the children if they had the determination, confidence, and ambition to "be ready to fight for the cause of communism," and the whole audience immediately responded loudly: "Always be ready!"

Also present to offer congratulations were Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and others.

More than one hundred Young Pioneer representatives from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in Beijing attended the meeting.

Soviet Young Pioneer representative Ina Tazova extended the most heartfelt and sincere congratulations to the Chinese Young Pioneers on behalf of the Soviet Young Pioneers. When she said, "We must consolidate the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union like our fathers and brothers," thunderous applause erupted from the audience. She also presented gifts to the Beijing Young Pioneers on behalf of the Soviet Young Pioneers. The Korean children also presented a large flower basket to the Beijing Young Pioneers.

Five hundred and eighty-five outstanding Young Pioneer collectives and four hundred and forty-seven outstanding instructors, who had emerged in Beijing in the ten years since the founding of the team, were commended and rewarded by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau at today's meeting.

After the ceremony, the Young Pioneers watched songs and dances performed by their companions and wonderful programs performed by famous artists, literary and art groups, and athletes. Suddenly, the Great Hall of the People was filled with songs and laughter from the children everywhere. Six hundred Young Pioneers performed the chorus "Make Progress Every Day." The Dongcheng District Red Scarf Philharmonic Orchestra played "New Spring Music." The China Children's Theater and the Beijing Dance School performed excerpts from the drama "Snow Queen" and the ballet "Le Corsaire" for the children respectively.

　　北京少先队员庆祝建队十年
    彭真胡耀邦勉励少年儿童好好学习
    新华社18日讯　雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂今天成了孩子们的欢乐世界。首都一万七千多名“红领巾”和少年先锋队辅导员在这里举行了庆祝北京建立少年先锋队十年大会。中共北京市委第一书记、北京市市长彭真，共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦，全国妇联主席蔡畅等出席了大会。
    十二岁的小主席——少先队员唐景身宣布大会开始。随着儿童乐队清脆的鼓号声，队员们高举二十面队旗走向主席台。接着，五十名队员集体朗诵了庆祝少先队十周年的诗篇：“第一个十年”。他们兴奋地朗诵：
    党比父母还要亲，
    抚育我们成长，
    我们坚决跟着党走，
    用心听党的话。
    如果没有党呀，
    十年来的一切都是空想！
    彭真市长在孩子们的热烈掌声中讲了话。他首先祝贺少先队诞生十年。他说：“刚才你们的朗诵诗问：再过十年你们干什么？当社会主义建设红旗手，当共产主义的红旗手。少先队员要学习，学好、锻炼好全心全意为人民服务，为社会主义服务，为共产主义服务的本领，学习好，锻炼好保卫社会主义、保卫共产主义、保卫祖国和人民的坚强意志和本领，谁要危害我们的祖国和社会主义，反对共产主义，反对党反对人民，你们就反对他们，打倒他们。”这时台下爆发出春雷般的掌声，表示出孩子们的巨大决心和意志。彭真最后勉励全体少先队员们在党、毛主席和团的领导下，好好学习知识和本领，好好在工作、劳动、体育中把自己锻炼成社会主义的红旗手、共产主义的红旗手，祖国和党的好儿女。
    共青团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦代表共青团中央向孩子们问好。他说：“少年先锋队是一支为建设社会主义和共产主义而积极进行准备的预备队。你们应该这么想：现在，我是小孩，不久我就会成长为大人；今天，我是建设社会主义和共产主义的预备队员，明天，我应该成为建设社会主义和共产主义的突击队员，后天，我还应该成为建设社会主义和共产主义的先锋队员。你们现时的任务就是像党和毛主席所号召的：好好学习，天天向上。第一，应当学习知识。第二，应当学习劳动。第三，应当学习为人民服务的共产主义精神。”他在结束讲话的时候问孩子们是否有决心、有信心、有志气“准备着，为共产主义事业而奋斗”，全场立即响亮地回答：“时刻准备着！”
    到会祝贺的，还有中共北京市委第二书记刘仁、全国妇联副主席康克清等。
    在北京的苏联和各兄弟国家一百多名少先队员代表参加了大会。
    苏联少先队员代表依娜·塔佐娃代表苏联少先队向中国的少先队员致最衷心最真诚的祝贺。当她说到“我们要像我们的父亲和哥哥一样巩固中苏两国人民的友谊”时，全场响起了震耳的掌声。她并代表苏联少先队员向北京少先队赠送了礼品。朝鲜小朋友也向北京少先队员们赠送了一个大花篮。
    北京建队十年来涌现出的五百八十五个少先队优秀集体和四百四十七名优秀辅导员，在今天的大会上受到共青团北京市委和北京市教育局的表扬和奖励。
    大会仪式结束后，队员们观看了小伙伴们表演的歌舞和著名的艺术家、文艺团体和运动员表演的精彩节目。顿时，人民大会堂里歌声不绝，到处洋溢着孩子们的欢笑。六百个少先队员表演了大合唱“天天向上”。东城区红领巾管弦乐队演奏了“新春乐”。中国儿童剧院、北京舞蹈学校分别为孩子们演出了话剧“雪女王”和芭蕾舞“海侠”的片断。已经把生产任务跨进到1963年的青年女工刘雅君、北京公共汽车公司青年司机红旗手于金印、四季青人民公社副主任李墨林等先进生产者都和孩子们在一起欢庆节日。（附图片）
