    Seize High Yields, Strive for High Quality, Compete in Thrift, Compare Safety: Mass Movement Waves Roll On
    Light Industry Departments in All Trades Gallop Forward
    Seventy Percent of Major Products Increased by More Than One-Fifth in September, Product Quality Generally Improved

    (Our Dispatch) A new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement on the light industry front is surging forward, and a great situation of comprehensive great leap forward has appeared in production, creating extremely favorable conditions for completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    The first characteristic of this new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement on the light industry front is: it comes on strong, is large-scale, and combines vigorousness with down-to-earthness. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to oppose right-leaning, encourage enthusiasm, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of workers and staff in the light industry system responded warmly and immediately took action. The publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further boosted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff. Various regions and enterprises held mobilization meetings, worker representative meetings, leap forward oath-taking meetings, and skills competitions, discussing and formulating new targets for increasing production and practicing economy, and formulating new measures. Workers and staff competed to beat the war drums and forge ahead courageously. Inter-factory competitions, same-trade competitions, counterpart competitions, and red flag competitions were carried out in full swing between enterprises, workshops, groups, and individuals. The atmosphere of "seizing high yields, striving for high quality, competing in thrift, and comparing safety" was extremely enthusiastic. Leading cadres went deep into the front line of production, worked alongside the workers, used the "three-way combination" method to study and solve problems in production in a timely manner, and adopted methods such as daily inspections, ten-day evaluations, and monthly summaries to promote the in-depth development of the movement.

    The second characteristic of the new upsurge is: high yield, high quality, low consumption, safety, and all-round development in more, faster, better, and more economical ways. According to statistics on 32 major products, the output of most products increased month by month in August and September. In September, the increase rate of 70% of the products was more than 20% compared with August. For example, the output of thermos bottles increased by 17.3% in August compared with July, and increased by 25% in September compared with August; the output of soap increased by 21.2% and 22.2% in August and September respectively; the output of cigarettes increased by 31% and doubled respectively. Some products broke the "routine" of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, making production rise steadily. For example, the output of matches and cigarettes increased by 6.6% and 46% respectively in the first ten days of September compared with the last ten days of August. By the end of September, the output of products such as clocks, cameras, film, thermos bottles, and alcohol had exceeded the total output of 1958. In terms of product quality, the quality of most products was basically stable and slightly improved, and the quality of some products increased significantly. For example, the qualification rate of newsprint and letterpress paper produced by six paper mills in Guangzhou, Jilin, Yibin, Shenyang, Shixian, and Mudanjiang was higher in August and September than in June and July, with some reaching as high as 97% to 99%, exceeding the quality level of the first half of 1958. The physical properties and appearance quality of rubber shoes have improved. The qualification rate of sneakers produced in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Harbin, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other cities has exceeded the first half of the year, and some have exceeded the quality standards stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry. According to statistics from twelve factories, the first-class product rate of thermos bottles has increased from 80% in July to 85% in September. Many enterprises, on the premise of ensuring product quality, vigorously practiced economy and reduced the consumption of raw materials. For example, the consumption of raw wood for papermaking has generally decreased. The amount of raw wood consumed per ton of sulfate wood pulp has dropped to 5.2 to 5.3 cubic meters in September, which is 11% lower than the advanced level in 1957. The unit consumption of raw wood for sulfite wood pulp (bleached pulp board) is 5.3 cubic meters, and the unit consumption of raw wood for mechanical wood pulp is 2.6 cubic meters, which is 7.8% and 7.2% lower than in 1957, respectively. The amount of raw rubber used for cotton rubber shoes has been reduced from an average of 135 to 140 centimeters per pair to 130 to 132 centimeters. The consumption of tobacco leaves for cigarettes, potassium chlorate for matches, and soda ash for glass has decreased in most factories.

    The third characteristic of the new upsurge is: the content of technical revolution and technical innovation is becoming increasingly rich, advanced experience is widely promoted, and the equipment utilization rate, labor productivity, and yield rate of various industries have been greatly improved. For example, the glass industry has improved its equipment and built a new type of fully gasified furnace, which has the advantages of high furnace temperature, good materialization, and coal saving. A gasified furnace saves 50% of coal compared with the original round furnace, and the production capacity can be increased by three times. In the leather industry, the new tanning method combining plant and mineral tanning agents is adopted, which shortens the production cycle of cowhide sole leather from sixty days to twenty to thirty days. The clock and watch industry has summarized and promoted the experience of automatic feeding of punches, mechanized assembly, etc., which generally increases production efficiency by two to three times. Changli County, Hebei Province, and Gaotang County, Shandong Province, used multi-穗 sorghum stalks to produce brown sugar, with a sugar extraction rate of about 5%. By-products can also be used for papermaking, winemaking, and feed, which not only opens up new raw materials for sugar making, but also uses one thing for multiple purposes and explores the potential of materials.

    The fourth characteristic of the new upsurge is: the communist style of collaboration has been greatly promoted. The broad masses of workers and staff not only help and support each other within the enterprise, but also widely carry out the "others first, ourselves later, outsiders first, insiders later" large-scale collaboration between industries and regions. For example, Yingkou Paper Mill took the initiative to help Jincheng Paper Mill improve its pulping capacity, and also supported the pressure controller instrument, supplementing the safety equipment that Jincheng Paper Mill had been lacking for a long time. When Andong No. 2 Paper Mill was about to shut down due to a shortage of copper mesh, No. 3 Mill resolutely took out one bed, even though it only had one in its warehouse, to support No. 2 Mill. This kind of collaboration has played a positive role in promoting production.

    At present, the light industry workers and staff across the country are further opposing right-leaning and encouraging enthusiasm, fighting a major battle in the fourth quarter, and seizing the time to prepare for the production in the first quarter of next year, so as to ensure a continuous great leap forward.

    夺高产　争优质　赛节约　比安全　群众运动波浪滔滔
    轻工部门行行业业跨骏马
    九月份百分之七十的主要产品产量增长五分之一以上，产品质量普遍提高
    本报讯　轻工业战线上增产节约运动的新高潮汹涌澎湃，生产中出现了全面大跃进的大好形势，为提前和超额完成今年计划创造了极为有利的条件。
    轻工业战线这次增产节约运动的新高潮的第一个特点是：来势猛，规模大，轰轰烈烈和踏踏实实相结合。党中央发出反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的号召以后，轻工业系统的广大职工热烈响应，马上行动起来。党的八届八中全会决议的公布，更加鼓舞了广大职工的干劲。各地区、各企业纷纷召开动员大会、职工代表大会、跃进誓师大会和比武大会等，讨论和制订了新的增产节约指标，订出了新的措施。职工们争擂战鼓，勇往直前。厂际竞赛、同工种竞赛、对口赛、红旗赛等在企业、车间、小组、个人之间热火朝天地开展起来。“夺高产，争优质，赛节约，比安全”的气氛热烈非凡。领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，跟班劳动，运用“三结合”的方法，及时研究和解决生产中的问题，并且采取日检查、旬评比、月总结等办法，推动了运动的深入发展。
    新高潮的第二个特点是：高产，优质，低耗，安全，多快好省全面发展。据三十二种主要产品的统计，8、9两月绝大部分产品的产量都逐月上升，9月份70％的产品比8月份增长幅度达20％以上。如热水瓶产量，8月比7月增长17.3％，9月又比8月增长25％；肥皂产量8月、9月分别增长21.2％和22.2％；卷烟产量分别增长31％和一倍。有些产品打破了月初松、月末紧的“常规”，使生产稳定地上升。如火柴和卷烟，9月上旬就比8月下旬分别增长6.6％和46％。到9月底止，钟表、照相机、胶卷、热水瓶、酒精等产品已经超过了1958年的全年产量。产品质量方面，多数产品是基本稳定并略有提高，部分产品质量有显著上升。如广州、吉林、宜宾、沈阳、石岘、牡丹江等六个纸厂的新闻纸、凸板纸的合格率，8月、9月都比6、7月份升高，有的高达97％到99％，超过了1958年上半年的质量水平。胶鞋的物理性能和外观质量都有提高，天津、上海、青岛、哈尔滨、广州、重庆等市产的球鞋，合格率都超过上半年，有的已经超过了轻工业部规定的质量标准。热水瓶的一级品率，据十二个厂的统计，已由7月份的80％提高到9月份的85％。许多企业在保证产品质量的前提下，厉行节约，降低了原材料消耗量。如造纸的原木消耗量普遍降低，硫酸盐木浆每吨耗用原木量9月份已降至5.2到5.3立方米，比1957年的先进水平还降低了11％，亚硫酸木浆（漂白浆板）原木单位消耗量为5.3立方米，机械木浆为2.6立方米，比1957年分别降低7.8％和7.2％。棉胶鞋的生胶用量，平均每双由135到140公分降到130到132公分。卷烟用烟叶、火柴用氯酸钾、玻璃用纯碱的消耗量，多数厂都有所降低。
    新高潮的第三个特点是：技术革命和技术革新内容日益丰富、先进经验广为推广，各行业的设备利用率、劳动生产率和出品率都有很大提高。例如，玻璃行业改进了设备新建成了一种全煤气炉，它具有炉温高、化料好、省煤的优点，一座煤气炉比原有的圆炉节约煤50％，而生产能力可以提高三倍。皮革工业中采用植物与矿物鞣料相结合的新的鞣制皮革法，使牛底革的生产周期由六十天缩短到二十到三十天。钟表工业总结和推广了冲床自动送料、装配机械化等经验，一般都提高生产效率二至三倍。河北昌黎县、山东高唐县利用多穗高粱秆制出了红糖，出糖率5％左右，副产品还可以造纸、酿酒、作饲料等，不仅开辟了制糖的新原料，而且一物多用，发掘了物资潜力。
    新高潮的第四个特点是：共产主义的协作风气大大发扬。广大职工不仅在企业内部互相帮助互相支援，而且在行业、地区之间广泛开展了“先人后己，先外后内”的大协作。例如，营口造纸厂主动帮助金城纸厂提高了制浆的能力，又支援了控制压力器的仪表，补充了金城厂长期缺乏的安全设备。安东造纸二厂缺铜网将要停机，三厂仓库中虽仅有一床，也毅然拿出来支援二厂。这种协作都对促进生产起了积极作用。
    目前，全国轻工业职工正进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，大战第四季度，并抓紧时间为明年第一季度的生产作准备，保证持续不断地大跃进。（附图片）
