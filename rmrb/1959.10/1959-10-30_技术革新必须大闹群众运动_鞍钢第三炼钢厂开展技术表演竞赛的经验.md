    Technical Innovation Must Involve Vigorous Mass Movements
    — The Experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steelmaking Plant in Carrying out Technical Performance Competitions
    Since May of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steelmaking Plant has gradually explored a working method of the mass line in its practical work to continuously promote production leaps, which is to mobilize the masses and carry out technical performance competitions.
    This kind of technical performance competition does not directly compete in production indicators such as output and quality, but focuses on key production aspects, adopting the form of on-site performance and observation, competing in enthusiasm and diligence, and competing in technical operation, working methods, cooperative assistance, and other production activities, to achieve the goals of high yield, high quality, and low cost. These performance competitions include individual and single-item performances, as well as collective operation and joint cooperation performances, and even temporary "call-up" and immediate "linking-up" performances. Advanced workers can perform, and general or even less advanced workers can also perform. In short, every position, every type of work, and every task can be performed. Veteran workers perform, and new workers learn and help; new workers perform, and veteran workers assist and guide. Not only are mature experiences performed, but wherever there are weak links, performances are held there. The technical performance competition adopts the method of speaking, doing, teaching, learning, experimenting, appraising, summarizing, and promoting simultaneously, closely combining theory with practice, and closely combining the improvement of technology with solving key production issues, truly achieving learning from each other's strengths to overcome weaknesses, and common improvement, forming a broad mass technical performance competition movement in which everyone performs, everything is performed, and every team performs. Among the factory's 2,158 employees, incomplete statistics by early September showed that there had been more than 29,900 large and small performance activities throughout the factory, with a total of more than 82,800 participants. The most active individual performed more than 110 times. Through the technical performance competition, the ideological awareness and technical level of the masses of employees have been greatly improved, enterprise management has been strengthened, leadership level has been enhanced, and production has been continuously promoted to leap forward. Since May, the production plan has been overfulfilled every month, and the average daily steel output has gradually increased from 2,701 tons in January-April to 3,965 tons in August and 4,080 tons in September; and the quality has been good every month; since June, the task of reducing costs has also been overfulfilled month by month.
          The Process of Development
    The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steelmaking Plant was gradually built and put into production starting from June 1st of last year. New workers account for 54% of the total, and veteran workers account for 46%. Even the veteran workers had never operated such large-scale fixed open-hearth furnaces before, and both new and veteran workers had to start from scratch. The management level was even more unable to keep up with the requirements of production development. Under these circumstances, although the production level had been gradually rising since the start of operations and many achievements had been made, it was always felt to be strenuous in work, and the daily output had remained at the level of 2,000 to 3,000 tons before April.
    Overcoming Right-Leaning Thoughts, Tapping Internal Potential
    Under these circumstances, the Party Committee had also proposed various methods many times to rapidly promote production, but they had not been truly resolved. In this process of repeated exploration, some comrades developed a slack and disheartened mood, believing that "the new factory, new people, and new equipment are just difficult to manage"; some complained that "the quality of refractory bricks is not good"; some emphasized that "if the crane is not installed, it will not be easy to promote production"; and some even doubted "what are the benefits of fixed large-scale open-hearth furnaces anyway." The Party Committee resolutely opposed this right-leaning thought, demanding that everyone look inward, face the masses, and make every effort to tap internal potential. After analysis, everyone believed that although "the factory is new, the people are new, the equipment is new," the equipment required by the design is not yet complete, and the quality of refractory bricks is not good are all facts, but the fundamental issue is how to rapidly improve the technical operation level of workers and the enterprise management level.
    How to quickly solve this urgent problem? Many methods had been adopted in the past: running red-and-expert schools, explaining operating procedures, inviting advanced producers to impart advanced experience, signing master-apprentice contracts, running professional technical training classes, and organizing production experts to perform operations, etc., all of which played a significant role. However, because what was taught and what was actually done were not closely combined, and technical learning could not be sustained due to tight production schedules, it could not meet the needs of rapidly improving technical level and adapting to the continuous leaps in production. Moreover, the performances at that time were only occasional performances by a few advanced producers, and did not become a mass and regular performance, so the effect was not significant. In April, two Soviet experts were invited to guide the work. On the one hand, the experts were asked to give lectures, and on the other hand, the experts were asked to perform practical operations, and cadres and workers were sent to learn from the experts' operating experience, and then give operating performances to everyone. The feedback from the masses showed that technical performance was a good method that was both popular with the masses and could rapidly improve technical level. After deliberation, on May 14th, the Party Committee decided to carry out technical performances throughout the factory.
    Breaking Mystique, Establishing Benchmarks, Encouraging Performances
    After the Party Committee decided to carry out technical performances, some cadres did not have sufficient understanding of this, believing that "workers are operating all day, there is nothing to perform," and "the work is disorganized and complicated, it is not easy to perform." Some veteran workers were also afraid of losing face by performing poorly and being laughed at. New workers generally believed that they had not yet learned general operations, so there was nothing to perform. In short, they viewed the performances as too mysterious. In response to this, the Party Committee, on the one hand, conducted extensive publicity and education inside and outside the Party, and on the other hand, encouraged Party members, League members, and activists to take the lead in performing, and established benchmarks. First, Feng Zhitai (Party member), a young assistant from the No. 22 open-hearth furnace, and Cao Xinzhi (Party member), an assistant from the No. 23 open-hearth furnace, etc., performed blocking the taphole and blowing the furnace top, which achieved good results, shortening the time by half compared to usual. After this first shot was fired, the Party Committee seized this fact and launched a vigorous publicity campaign throughout the factory, which shook every workshop. Subsequently, each workshop organized demonstrative performances, such as unloading magnesite-fire clay in the raw materials workshop, and connecting the taphole in the ingot casting workshop. All the demonstrative performances achieved good results. For example, the magnesite-fire clay unloading performance took only six hours for six people to complete the workload that used to take two shifts; the taphole connection performance was shortened from more than one hour to 25 minutes. These practical effects increased the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to lead technical performances, and encouraged new and veteran workers to participate in the courage and interest of the performances. Those who did not dare to perform were now able to perform. In this way, the mystique surrounding technical performances was broken.
    Focusing on Key Production Aspects, Organizing Everyone to Perform,
    Everything to be Performed, Every Team to Perform
    After the "mysterious" view of technical performance was eliminated, technical performance activities were initially carried out in the main positions of the open-hearth furnace and ingot casting workshops, and in some types of work in auxiliary departments, and production also increased somewhat. However, the development of the movement was not yet universal or widespread. In particular, the "furnace hurdle" of the open-hearth furnace had not yet been overcome, and the operating rate was not yet high. The Party Committee analyzed the situation of the previous stage of the movement and believed that in order to significantly increase production in June, the technical performances must be carried out more extensively and persistently. Therefore, it put forward the new slogan of "Everyone Performs, Everything is Performed, Every Team Performs, Breakthrough Key Issues." Each workshop, according to the overall requirements of the Party Committee, focused on the key issues of the entire factory, determined the key projects of the workshop, and launched a mass movement of everyone performing, everything being performed, and every team performing. In order to rapidly develop the technical performance movement, the Party Committee and each branch further strengthened their leadership of the movement. Party organizations frequently held on-site meetings to exchange performance experience; established benchmarks, organized mass observation; praised good people and deeds and publicized performance results; and in particular, strengthened the ideological work of cadres, through Party meetings, cadre meetings, individual talks, and other forms, educated cadres to keep up with the development of the movement, emphasized that administrative cadres must personally take the lead and personally grasp the work, and required shift leaders, foremen, and furnace chiefs to participate in performances and lead performances, so as to have arrangements before the shift, leadership during the shift, and inspection after the shift. In this way, the technical performance movement focusing on solving key production issues rapidly developed throughout the factory.
    From Technical Performance to Technical Performance Competition
    In the mass technical performance movement, a competitive upsurge of individuals, furnaces, and workshops chasing each other, learning from each other, and cooperating and supporting each other gradually emerged. At this time, it had become clear that through the technical performance competition, not only could the technical operation level be improved, but also the working methods, production preparation, cooperative assistance, enterprise management, and strengthening and improvement were driven forward. The Party Committee analyzed this situation in July and believed that the technical performance must be elevated a step further and closely combined with the competition. Therefore, it put forward the slogan of comprehensively carrying out the "performance competition." This slogan quickly won the support of the vast majority of cadres and workers, and a technical performance competition upsurge was launched in a vigorous manner.
    The development from technical performance by a few advanced producers to mass technical performance, and then further to technical performance competition, are all very important developments. Practice has proved that this kind of technical performance competition is indeed a major form of competition among the various forms of competition in the enterprise, and it can drive and improve other forms of competition. In the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant, when it was combined with the "opponent competition" and "one-dragon cooperative competition" between workers of the same type, there appeared "opponent performance competition," "one-dragon cooperative performance competition," and the workers' own "call-up competition" and "linking-up competition," etc. Although the names are different, they all focus on competing in enthusiasm and diligence, competing in technical operation, working methods, cooperative assistance, production organization, and preparation work, in order to achieve the goal of promoting production. The "opponent performance competition" is a relatively fixed form of performance competition in which individuals find their own opponents, soldiers face soldiers, and generals face generals; the "call-up competition" is a temporary form of performance competition in which workers of the same type mutually nominate and appoint each other in order to solve the same task. For example, the furnace tops and tapholes between furnaces temporarily "call up" each other, asking to compete with each other. This form is available in every shift, and everyone can "call up" and appoint generals, and can compete anytime and anywhere, which is very popular with the masses. The "one-dragon performance competition" is a cooperative competition over a relatively long period of time. The "linking-up performance competition" is a form of performance competition between workshops and processes to cooperate in solving a temporary and important project, and it is also a form of cooperation competition. After the technical performance was combined with the labor competition, people's enthusiasm for the performance was even greater, they learned from each other, promoted each other, learned from each other's strengths to overcome weaknesses, and the effect of solving key problems was even better.
    After the announcement of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of employees was even more encouraged, and the technical performance competition was further developed. The employees were not only competing in operation, working methods, and various indicators, but also in protecting equipment and saving materials, etc. The content of the competition was more comprehensive, the spirit of cooperation was more developed, the leadership of the competition was further strengthened, and the scale of the competition movement was broader. From the technical performance competition in on-site production, it developed to the performance competition in the departments and even to the performance competition of cooking by the canteen staff, and a regular evaluation system was established. In the technical performance competition, publicity activities were carried out in a big way, and full use was made of publicity forms and tools such as big-character posters, small-character posters, blackboard newspapers, competition signs, model worker platforms, martial arts gatherings, on-site meetings, propaganda teams, congratulatory teams, especially loudspeakers, etc., creating a lively technical performance competition momentum.
        Achievements
    After several months of the technical performance competition movement, significant results have been achieved in terms of production outlook, technical level, ideological awareness of the vast majority of people, and enterprise management.
  Improved Technical Level, Solved Key Production Issues
    The technical performance competition has universally improved the technical level. Many new workers who could not operate their positions have learned to operate their positions; many who were not skilled in their operations have become skilled workers; many who were only familiar with their own lines of work have become all-rounders. According to the statistics of 1,016 people in the open-hearth furnace, ingot casting, and furnace repair workshops in August, the number of skilled workers has increased from 341 before the competition to 671; 116 have reached a higher level of technical skill, and 181 are close to a higher level of technical skill; 48 have been promoted to foremen, furnace chiefs, first assistants, and second assistants. Due to the mass and wide-ranging nature of the technical performance competition, workers have the opportunity to contact and learn various aspects of operating technology, and therefore many people have become all-rounders. The workers' technical operation level has been improved, and it has basically adapted to the needs of current production.
    With the continuous improvement of the technical operation level, the workers have continuously innovated technology and improved operations, new operating methods have continued to emerge, and many long-standing key production problems have been solved. Poor taphole handling is the biggest headache for open-hearth furnace workers. In April, taphole alone delayed production for 71 hours, seriously affecting production. After the technical performance competition, the taphole was opened in just a few minutes. Adjusting the heat load is a long-standing problem. After the technical performance competition, the thermal engineering technology was improved, which extended the life of the furnace, improved the effective operating rate, and shortened the smelting time. Patching the front wall is one of the keys to maintaining the furnace well. In the technical performance competition of An Xuehai, the furnace chief of the No. 22 open-hearth furnace, the advantages of other people's operations were concentrated. The method of patching the front wall with one shovel was improved to patching the front wall with four shovels crossed, which shortened the operation time from about 30 minutes to 6 minutes, improving efficiency by five times and ensuring quality. Since the launch of the technical performance competition, new operating methods have emerged in almost every production link throughout the factory, technology has been innovated, work has been improved, and various technical and economic indicators have made new leaps forward. For example, the effective operating rate has gradually increased from 68% in April to 88.92% in August and 89.98% in September; the furnace bottom utilization coefficient has gradually increased from 6.1 in April to 9.15 in August and 9.25 in September. Due to the improvement of the technical level, the intensity of the workers' physical labor has also been reduced. Some workers reflected: "In the past, the furnace controlled people, but now people control the furnace."
      Improved Awareness, Boosted Enthusiasm,
              Strengthened Cooperation
    Through the technical performance competition, a upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been formed. The advanced are even more advanced, and the backward have also caught up with the advanced. Comrade Yang Derong, the general furnace chief of the No. 21 open-hearth furnace, was not proactive enough in his work and often lagged behind others. After the technical performance competition, with everyone's encouragement and help, he took active actions and reversed the backward situation of this furnace. When he completed the August production plan three days and fifteen hours ahead of schedule, he excitedly said: "The performance is like a mirror, which clearly shows who is advanced and who is backward." Some of the new workers who had never spent a summer in the steelmaking plant were not at ease in their work. After the technical performance competition, they also settled down to work, and some have become performance experts and were rated as models. The attitude of engineering and technical personnel towards the performance competition has also undergone significant changes. Jin Han, a smelting engineer, saw the creative labor achievements of the masses in the technical performance competition and believed that "the technical performance competition has great potential."
    On the basis of the improved ideological awareness of the vast majority of people, mutual assistance and cooperation have become a common practice. People to people, furnace to furnace, workshop to workshop, and inside and outside the factory, up and down, left and right, all show a communist style of selflessness and mutual support. The workers on each furnace in the open-hearth furnace, as long as they hear from the loudspeaker that a certain furnace has a collective task such as blocking a false sill, from the first assistant to the workers, they will run over at any time with a shovel in hand to provide support, and even the small repair workers and loading machine operators will also automatically assist. In this way, each blocking of a false sill has been shortened from about 30 minutes to 7 or 8 minutes. The workers praised this spirit of cooperation and said: "Cooperation has turned a few people on our furnace into dozens of people," "It's not just one first assistant, but five first assistants," "The past cooperation was reciprocity, but now it's better and better."
            Improved Management Level,
        Established and Improved Rules and Regulations
    With the widespread development of the technical performance competition, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened. In particular, administrative cadres at all levels have learned many working methods of the mass line, making their daily administrative work more closely integrated with mass movements. Many grassroots cadres felt that "the work is easier to do," "I know what's going on," and "I can do mass work," thus improving the level of enterprise management. The advanced operating methods that emerged in the technical performance competition were quickly incorporated into the rules and regulations after research. For example, 53 systems such as thermal engineering management, furnace repair quality inspection, raw material management, ladle, slag can management, and equipment maintenance inspection were established and improved in the process of technical performance competition. The establishment of these rules and regulations has played a good role in ensuring product quality and extending furnace life. At the same time, because it comes from the masses and returns to the masses, and comes from practice and returns to practice, it is relatively smooth to implement. In addition, each workshop has also established many safety operating procedures and various temporary contact contracts based on practical experience.
            Some Experiences
    What experiences has the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 3 Steelmaking Plant gained in carrying out mass technical performance competitions?
    First, continuously overcoming right-leaning thoughts and resolutely implementing the General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Building Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out the technical performance competition movement and promoting the continuous leap forward in production. The entire process of the technical performance competition movement is actually a process of opposing right-leaning, boosting enthusiasm, and using the spirit of the General Line to educate and improve the ideological awareness of the vast majority of people. Last year's Great Leap Forward achieved tremendous results, but since the beginning of this year, some cadres have had right-leaning conservative ideas and wavered about continuing the leap forward this year. In order to unify thinking and improve understanding, in the first quarter of this year, the Party Committee of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant, according to the instructions of the higher Party Committee, organized all cadres and the vast majority of employees to earnestly study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session, summarized the work of the ten months since the start of operations last year, clarified thinking, and criticized erroneous understandings, so that the spirit of the General Line was further implemented. The Party Committee also put forward the slogan of "Grasp the First Half of the Year Firmly, Catch Up Early Rather Than Late," and further established the idea of going all out and aiming high among the entire Party and employees. In April, production encountered difficulties again, and the emotions of some cadres and the masses fluctuated. At this time, right-leaning thoughts reared their heads again. Some people were frightened by this temporary difficulty, and some emphasized that "the cranes are insufficient," "the equipment is incomplete," "the quality of refractory bricks is not good," and "it is inevitable that production will not leap forward," etc. The Party Committee resolutely criticized this right-leaning thought, emphasizing that as long as we rely on the masses to tap internal potential, we can overcome difficulties and complete the production plan. In this way, in the face of difficulties, everyone not only did not lose heart, but instead stimulated greater revolutionary enthusiasm, the mass movement had new developments, the technical performance competition was launched in a vigorous manner, and production immediately appeared a new situation. After July, when production showed a situation of continuous leap forward, the Party Committee promptly put forward the prevention and overcoming of possible complacency. In August, it also earnestly studied the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and in accordance with the leap forward situation of production, put forward a new goal of guaranteeing an increase of 70,000 tons of steel, and in September and October, it continuously put forward new measures and slogans. In this way, on the one hand, complacency was prevented, and on the other hand, the enthusiasm of the employees was greatly encouraged to actively participate in technical performances, so that production continuously leaped forward.
    The process of promoting the technical performance competition is also a process of struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and a process of continuously improving the awareness, technical level, and work level of the masses. The No. 3 Steelmaking Plant has always regarded strengthening ideological work as an important link in promoting the technical performance competition movement, closely integrating political work with economic work through the technical performance competition, constantly understanding the demands of the masses, enlightening the masses to overcome various ideological concerns, and actively participating in the technical performance competition. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses, propaganda and education work has also been strengthened in many ways, creating momentum, so that everyone feels the importance of their work, feels the glory of participating in the performance, and recognizes that through the technical performance competition, they can improve their work, do a good job in production, and make contributions to the country. Because the masses are organized to observe the performances, visit each other, and through the dissemination of real people and real things, the purpose of mass self-education is achieved. At the same time, the leadership also educates the masses with the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly puts forward new struggle goals to the masses according to the development of the situation, and guides the masses to advance towards higher goals. For example, at the beginning of the technical performance, in order to quickly spread the technical performance throughout the factory, the slogan of "Everyone Performs, Everything is Performed, Every Team Performs, Breakthrough Key Issues" was put forward; when the technical performance competition was widely carried out throughout the factory, in response to the complacency of individual cadres and workers, the new slogan of "Coming from a Technical School, Being Proficient in the Profession" was timely put forward, and further put forward the new slogan of "Guaranteeing an Increase of 70,000 Tons of High-Quality Steel," encouraging the masses to move forward continuously.
    Second, grasp the main contradictions in production, and also find methods to solve the contradictions. The fundamental problem that existed in the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant for a considerable period of time was that the technical level of the employees was not adapted to the modernized technical equipment, and the situation of the Great Leap Forward required the rapid improvement of the production level. This contradiction was very sharp and prominent. Solving this fundamental problem was the most urgent requirement of the employees throughout the factory. After a period of exploration, the best way to solve this problem was found, which is the technical performance competition movement. Because the technical performance competition directly competes in technical operation methods and working methods, the goals are clear, it is easier to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and concentrate on improving the technical level, work level, and solving key problems. Because the technical performance competition has a wide mass nature, it can achieve everyone performing and everything being performed, which ensures that the production of the entire factory continuously leaps forward on the basis of the coordination and consistency of various processes and links.
    Third, strengthening the unified leadership of the Party and giving full play to the role of various organizations is the fundamental guarantee for mobilizing the masses to carry out the technical performance competition. In the early stage of the technical performance competition, the Party Committee mainly focused on grasping the unification of thinking and action, so that the forces of all aspects revolved around the technical performance competition; and when the movement was fully launched, the Party Committee focused its attention on strengthening the unified leadership of the Party, dividing responsibilities, and solving the new problems that constantly emerged in the technical performance competition, in order to ensure the healthy development of the movement.
    In the process of the technical performance competition, the Party Committee also paid close attention to improving the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee, and giving full play to the positive role of enterprise administration. Attention should be paid to giving play to the positive role of the Party's branches, groups, and individual Party members, so that they become the core force to promote the continuous progress of the technical performance competition. At the same time, the organizational role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League was also given play. Through the trade union, the masses were mobilized to conduct a major inspection, major summary, and major evaluation of the technical performance competition from bottom to top and from top to bottom, promoting the development of the technical performance competition. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the League organization also did a good job in the ideological work of the youth, established role models, and gave play to the youth's shock role.

    技术革新必须大闹群众运动
    ——鞍钢第三炼钢厂开展技术表演竞赛的经验
    从今年5月份以来，鞍钢第三炼钢厂在实际工作中逐步摸索到一个使生产不断跃进的群众路线的工作方法，这就是发动群众，开展技术表演竞赛。
    这种技术表演竞赛，不是直接比赛产量、质量等生产指标，而是针对生产关键，采用现场表演、观摩的形式，比赛干劲和钻劲，比赛技术操作、工作方法、协作互助等生产活动，来达到高产、优质、低成本的目的。这种表演竞赛，有单人、单项表演，也有集体操作和联合协作表演，还有临时“叫号”、随时“挂钩”的表演。先进工作者可以表演，一般的、甚至落后的也可以表演，总之各个岗位、各种工种、各项工作都可以表演。老工人表演，新工人学习、帮助；新工人表演，老工人协助、指导。不仅表演成熟的经验，而且那里有薄弱环节，就在那里表演。技术表演竞赛采用了边说、边做、边教、边学、边试验、边鉴定、边总结、边推广的方法，使理论与实践密切结合起来，使提高技术与解决生产关键密切结合起来，真正做到取长补短，共同提高，形成了人人表演、事事表演、班班表演的广大群众性的技术表演竞赛运动。全厂职工共有二千一百五十八人，截至9月初的不完全统计，全厂大小表演活动已进行了二万九千九百多次，参加表演的共达八万二千八百多人次，最多的一个人表演了一百一十多次。通过技术表演竞赛，使职工群众的思想觉悟、技术水平大大提高，加强了企业管理，提高了领导水平，促使生产不断跃进。5月份以来，生产计划每月都超额完成，钢的平均日产量，由1至4月份的二千七百零一吨，逐步上升到8月份的三千九百六十五吨和9月的四千零八十吨；而且各月质量都良好；6月以来又逐月超额完成了降低成本的任务。
          开展的过程
    鞍钢第三炼钢厂从去年6月1日陆续建成投入生产。全厂新工人占54％，老工人占46％，即使是老工人，也没有操作过这样的大型固定式平炉，新老工人都得从头学起；管理水平更跟不上生产发展的要求。在这种情况下，虽然从开工以来，生产水平也是逐渐上升的，并取得了不少的成绩；但是在工作中总感到吃力，日产量在4月份以前一直停留在二千多吨、三千吨的水平。
    克服右倾思想，挖掘内部潜力
    在这种情况下，党委也曾多次提出各种办法，使生产迅速跃上去，但是没有得到真正的解决。在这个反复摸索的过程中，有的同志产生松劲泄气情绪，认为“新厂子、人新、设备新，就是不好搞”；有的埋怨“耐火砖的质量不好”；有的强调“如果吊车不安上，生产就是不容易跃上去”；有的还怀疑“固定式大型平炉究竟有什么好处。”党委坚决反对了这种右倾思想，要求眼睛向内，面向群众，千方百计地挖掘内部潜力。经过分析，大家认为虽然“厂子新、人新、设备新”，按设计需要的设备还不齐全，以及耐火砖的质量不好都是事实，但是根本问题是如何尽速地提高工人的技术操作水平和企业管理水平。
    如何迅速地解决这一迫切的问题呢？过去也曾经采取过许多办法：办过红专学校，讲解操作规程，请先进生产者传授先进经验，订师徒合同，开办专业技术训练班，以及组织生产能手进行操作表演等等，虽都起了不小的作用，但是，由于讲的和实际作的结合得不够密切，又常常因为生产紧张，技术学习不能坚持，因此不能满足迅速提高技术水平和适应生产不断跃进的需要。而且，那时的表演也只是少数先进生产者偶然表演，没有成为群众性的经常的表演，因此效果也不大。4月间，请了两位苏联专家来指导工作，一方面请专家讲课，一方面请专家作实际操作表演，并派了干部和工人学习专家的操作经验，然后再给大家作操作表演。从群众的反映表明，技术表演是一种既受群众欢迎，又能迅速提高技术水平的好办法。经酝酿后，在5月14日，党委就决定在全厂开展技术表演。
    打破神秘，树立标兵，鼓励表演
    党委决定开展技术表演以后，有的干部对此认识不足，认为“工人整天在操作，没有什么好表演的”，“工作零乱、复杂，不好表演”。有的老工人也怕表演不好丢丑，被人笑话。新工人普遍认为自己一般操作还没有学会呢，没啥可表演的。总之，把表演看得过分神秘。对此，党委一方面在党内外广泛进行宣传教育，一方面鼓励党团员、积极分子带头表演，树立标兵。首先，二十二号平炉青年助手冯志太（党员），和二十三号平炉助手曹新志（党员）等，进行了堵出钢口、吹炉顶等表演，收到了良好的效果，比平时缩短了一半时间。打响了这头一炮以后，党委便抓住这个事实，在全厂大张旗鼓地展开了宣传，震动了全厂各个工段。随后各工段都组织了示范性的表演，如原料工段的卸镁火泥，铸锭工段的接出钢槽等，所有的示范表演都收到了很好的效果。例如卸镁火泥表演，六个人只用了六小时作完了过去两个班也卸不完的工作量；接出钢槽表演由过去的一小时多缩短到二十五分钟。这些实际效果，提高了各级干部领导技术表演的积极性，鼓舞了新老工人参加表演的勇气和兴趣，不敢表演的也敢于表演了。这样，技术表演的神秘思想就被打破了。
    围绕生产关键，组织人人表演，
        事事表演，班班表演
    技术表演的“神秘”观点被破除以后，在平炉、铸锭工段的主要岗位和辅助部门的部分工种中，技术表演活动便初步开展起来，生产也有所上升。但是运动发展还不普遍、不广泛。特别是平炉的“炉子关”还没有过去，作业率还不高。党委分析了前一段运动的情况，认为要使6月份生产有显著上升，必须把技术表演更加广泛持久地开展起来。因此，便提出了“人人表演、事事表演、班班表演、突破关键”的新口号。各工段都根据党委总的要求，围绕全厂的关键问题，确定了本工段的重点项目，开展了人人表演、事事表演、班班表演的群众运动。为了使技术表演运动迅速地开展起来，党委和各支部更有力地加强了对运动的领导。党组织经常召开现场会议，交流表演经验；树立标兵，组织群众观摩；表扬好人好事和宣传表演成效；特别是加强了干部的思想工作，通过党的会议、干部会议、个别谈话等形式，教育干部必须跟上运动的发展，强调了行政干部必须亲自上阵、亲自抓，要求值班长、工长、炉长参加表演、领导表演，做到班前有布置，班中有领导，班后有检查。这样，就使围绕解决生产关键问题的技术表演运动，迅速地在全厂范围内开展起来。
    由技术表演发展为技术表演竞赛
    在群众性的技术表演运动中，就逐渐出现了个人之间、炉子之间、工段之间你追我赶、互相学习、互相协作支援的竞赛热潮。这时已经看出，通过技术表演的竞赛，不只是可以提高技术操作水平，还带动了工作方法、生产准备、协作互助、企业管理的加强与改进。党委于7月份分析了这种情况，认为必须把技术表演提高一步，使它和竞赛密切结合起来，于是提出了全面开展“表演竞赛”的口号。这个口号迅速得到了广大干部和职工的拥护，一个技术表演竞赛的热潮便轰轰烈烈地开展了起来。
    由少数先进生产者的技术表演，发展为群众性的技术表演，并且又进一步发展为技术表演竞赛，这都是一些十分重要的发展。从实践中证明，这种技术表演竞赛，的确是企业内当前各种竞赛形式中的一个主要的竞赛形式，它可以带动、提高其他各种竞赛形式。在第三炼钢厂，当它与同工种之间的“对手赛”和“一条龙协作赛”结合之后，就出现了“对手表演赛”、“一条龙协作表演赛”，以及职工自己的“叫号赛”、“挂钩赛”等等。名目虽然不同，但都是着重比赛干劲和钻劲，比赛技术操作、工作方法、协作互助、生产组织和准备工作，以达到促进生产的目的。“对手表演赛”是一种自找对象、兵对兵、将对将和比较固定的一种表演竞赛形式；“叫号赛”是带有临时性的、同工种之间为了解决同一件工作的互相指名、点将的一种表演竞赛形式。如炉与炉之间的吹炉顶、堵出钢口等，临时互相“叫号”，要求与对方比一比，这种形式班班有，人人可以“叫号”点将，随时随地可以竞赛，很受群众欢迎。“一条龙表演赛”是比较长时间内的协作竞赛。“挂钩表演赛”是工段之间、工序之间为了协作解决某一个临时重要项目的表演竞赛形式，也是协作竞赛中的一种。技术表演和劳动竞赛结合起来以后，人们表演的劲头更足了，互相学习，互相促进，取长补短，解决关键问题的效果更好了。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布之后，更加鼓舞了广大职工的干劲，技术表演竞赛又有了进一步的发展，职工们不仅是比操作、比工作方法、比各种指标，还比爱护设备和节约材料等，竞赛内容更为全面了，协作之风更加发扬了，竞赛的领导更加加强了，竞赛运动的规模更为广阔了，由现场生产中的技术表演竞赛，发展到科室的表演赛以至食堂炊事人员的烧饭做菜的表演竞赛，并建立了经常性的评比制度。在技术表演竞赛中，曾经大张旗鼓地进行了宣传活动，充分运用了大字报、小字报、黑板报、竞赛牌、标兵台、比武会、现场会、宣传队、贺喜队，特别是扩音器等宣传形式和宣传工具，造成了热火朝天的技术表演竞赛声势。
        取得的成果
    经过几个月的技术表演竞赛运动，无论在生产面貌、技术水平、广大群众的思想觉悟以及企业管理等方面，都收到了显著的效果。
  提高了技术水平，解决了生产关键
    技术表演竞赛使技术水平普遍得到了提高。许多不会岗位操作的新工人，学会了岗位操作；许多操作不熟练的，变成了熟练工；许多只熟悉本行的，变成了多面手。8月份据平炉、铸锭、修炉三个工段一千零一十六人的统计，熟练工人已由竞赛前的三百四十一名，上升到六百七十一名；已经达到高一级技术水平的有一百一十六人，已接近高一级技术水平的有一百八十一人；已提拔为工长、炉长、一助手、二助手的有四十八人。由于技术表演竞赛的群众性和广泛性，工人有机会接触和学习多方面的操作技术，因此有不少人已成为多面手。工人的技术操作水平提高了，基本上适应了当前生产的需要。
    随着技术操作水平的不断提高，工人们不断地革新技术，改进操作，新的操作方法不断出现，许多长期未能解决的生产关键问题得到了解决。出钢口处理得不好，是平炉工人最头痛的事，4月份，只出钢口一项所耽误的时间就达七十一个小时，严重地影响生产。经过技术表演竞赛，只用几分钟就打开了出钢口。调整热负荷是长期没有解决的问题，经过技术表演竞赛，提高了热工技术，使炉体寿命延长了，有效作业率提高了，冶炼时间也缩短了。贴补前墙是维护好炉体的关键之一，在二十二号平炉炉长安学海的技术表演竞赛中，集中了别人操作上的优点，由过去用一铲贴前墙，改进为四铲交叉贴前墙的方法，使操作时间由过去的三十分钟左右，缩短到六分钟，提高效率五倍，保证了质量。开展技术表演竞赛以来，全厂每一个生产环节，几乎都出现了新的操作方法，革新了技术，改进了工作，使各项技术、经济指标都有新的跃进。例如有效作业率，由4月份的68％，逐步提高到8月份的88.92％、9月份的89.98％；炉底利用系数，由4月份的六点一，逐步提高到8月份的九点一五、9月份的九点二五。由于提高了技术水平，还减轻了工人体力劳动的强度，有的工人反映说：“过去是炉子掌握人，现在是人掌握炉子了。”
      提高了觉悟，鼓足了干劲，
              加强了协作
    通过技术表演竞赛，形成了学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮。先进的更加先进，落后的也赶上了先进。二十一号平炉总炉长杨得荣同志，原来工作不够主动，经常落在人家后面，经过技术表演竞赛，在大家带动和帮助下，积极行动起来，扭转了这个炉子的落后局面。当他提前三天零十五小时完成了8月份的生产计划时，激动地说：“表演好像一面镜子，谁先进、谁落后，照得一清二楚。”原来没有在炼钢厂过过夏天的新工人，一部分人不安心工作，经过技术表演竞赛，也安心工作了，有的已成为表演能手，被评为标兵。工程技术人员对表演竞赛的态度也发生了显著的变化，冶炼工程师靳汉，看到了群众在技术表演竞赛中创造性的劳动成果，认为“技术表演竞赛大有可为”。
    在广大群众思想觉悟提高的基础上，互助协作已成为普遍风气，人与人、炉与炉、工段与工段、以及厂内厂外、上下左右之间，都表现出舍己为人，互相支援的共产主义风格。平炉上各个炉子的工人，只要从扩音器里听到某一个炉子有堵假门坎等集体性的工作，就从一助手到工人，随时手持铁锹跑步前去支援，连小修理工人和装入机运转手也都自动协助。这样，每堵一炉假门坎，由过去的三十分钟左右，缩短到七、八分钟。工人们赞扬这种协作精神说：“协作使我们一个炉子上的几个人变成几十个人”，“不是一个一助手，而是五个一助手了”，“过去的协作是礼尚往来，现在是好上加好”。
            提高了管理水平，
        建立与健全了规章制度随着技术表演竞赛的广泛开展，进一步密切了干部与群众的关系。特别是各级行政干部，学会了许多群众路线的工作方法，使自己的日常行政工作与大搞群众运动更加密切地结合起来。许多基层干部都感到“工作好作了”，“心中有数了”，“会做群众工作了”，因而提高了企业管理水平。技术表演竞赛中出现的先进操作方法，经过研究以后，很快纳入了规章制度。例如热工管理、修炉质量检查、原材料管理、大罐、渣缶管理和设备维护检查等五十三项制度，就是在技术表演竞赛过程中建立和健全起来的。这些规章制度的建立，对于保证产品质量，延长炉体寿命等都起了良好的作用。同时，因为它是来自群众又回到群众中去，来自实践又回到实践中去，贯彻执行起来也比较顺利。此外，各工段还根据实际体验，建立起许多安全规程制度和各种临时性的联系合同。
            几　点　经　验
    鞍钢第三炼钢厂在开展群众性的技术表演竞赛中取得了一些什么经验呢？
    第一、不断地克服右倾思想，坚决贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是开展技术表演竞赛运动，促进生产不断跃进的根本保证。整个技术表演竞赛运动的过程，实际上是一个反右倾，鼓干劲，用总路线的精神教育、提高广大群众思想觉悟的过程。去年大跃进取得了巨大的成绩，但是，今年年初以来，一部分干部却存在右倾保守思想，对今年继续跃进摇摆不定。为了统一思想，提高认识，在今年第一季度，第三炼钢厂党委根据上级党委指示，组织全体干部和广大职工认真学习了中共八届六中全会文件，并且根据六中全会的精神，总结了去年开工以来十个月的工作，澄清了思想，批判了错误认识，使总路线的精神进一步得到了贯彻。党委又提出了“狠抓上半年、赶前不赶后”的口号，进一步在全党和职工中树立了鼓足干劲，力争上游的思想。4月份，生产上又遇到了困难，一部分干部、群众的情绪发生了波动。这时，右倾思想又抬头了，有些人为这种暂时的困难所吓倒，有的人强调“吊车不足”，“设备不全”，“耐火砖的质量不好”，“生产跃不上去在所难免”等等，党委坚决批判了这种右倾思想，强调只要依靠群众挖掘内部潜力，就可以克服困难完成生产计划。这样，在遇到困难的情况下，大家不但没有泄气，反而激发了更大的革命干劲，群众运动有了新的发展，技术表演竞赛轰轰烈烈开展起来，生产立即出现新的局面。7月以后，当生产出现不断跃进的形势，党委及时提出防止和克服可能产生的骄傲自满情绪。8月，又认真学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，根据生产跃进的情况，提出了保证增产七万吨钢的新的奋斗目标，9、10月又不断提出新的措施和口号。这样，一方面防止了骄傲自满情绪，另一方面又大大鼓舞了职工群众的干劲，积极参加技术表演，使生产不断跃进。
    推行技术表演竞赛的过程也是先进思想与落后思想斗争的过程，是不断地提高群众觉悟，提高技术水平与工作水平的过程。第三炼钢厂始终把加强思想工作作为推动技术表演竞赛运动的重要环节，通过技术表演竞赛，把政治工作与经济工作密切地结合起来，经常了解群众的要求，启发群众克服各种思想顾虑，积极地参加技术表演竞赛。为了鼓舞群众的积极性，还从多方面加强了宣传教育工作，造成声势，使人人都感到自己工作的重要性，感到参加表演的光荣，认识到通过技术表演竞赛能够提高工作，搞好生产，对国家作出贡献。由于在表演中组织群众进行观摩，互相访问，通过真人真事的传播，达到了群众自我教育的目的。同时，领导方面还以不断革命的精神教育群众，根据形势发展不断地向群众提出新的斗争目标，引导群众向更高的目标前进。如技术表演开始时，为了使技术表演在全厂迅速铺开，提出了“人人表演、事事表演、班班表演、突破关键”的口号；当技术表演竞赛在全厂广泛开展之后，针对个别干部和工人中产生的骄傲自满情绪，又及时提出“科班出身、精通本行”，并进一步提出“保证增产七万吨优质钢”等新的口号，鼓舞群众不断前进。
    第二、抓住生产中的主要矛盾，又要找到解决矛盾的方法。第三炼钢厂在相当长时间内存在的根本问题，是职工的技术水平同现代化的技术设备不相适应，而大跃进的形势又要求迅速地提高生产水平。这个矛盾非常尖锐、突出。解决这个根本问题是全厂职工最迫切的要求。经过一段摸索过程，才找到了解决这个问题的最好办法，就是技术表演竞赛运动。由于技术表演竞赛是直接比赛技术操作方法和工作方法，目标明确，就比较容易启发群众的积极性和创造性，集中到提高技术水平、工作水平和解决关键问题上来。由于技术表演竞赛具有广泛的群众性，能做到人人表演、事事表演，这样就保证了全厂生产在各个工序、各个环节协调一致的基础上不断跃进。
    第三、加强党的统一领导，充分发挥各个组织的作用，是发动群众开展技术表演竞赛的根本保证。在技术表演竞赛的初期，党委主要的是抓住了统一思想、统一行动，使各方面的力量都围绕技术表演竞赛开展工作；而当运动全面铺开之后，党委就把注意力集中到加强党的统一领导，分工负责，解决技术表演竞赛中不断出现的新的问题，以保证运动健康地向前发展。
    在技术表演竞赛过程中，党委还密切注意健全党委领导下的厂长负责制，充分发挥企业行政的积极作用。注意发挥党的支部、小组和党员个人的积极作用，使他们成为推动技术表演竞赛不断前进的核心力量。同时也发挥了工会、共青团的组织作用，通过工会，发动群众，自下而上和自上而下地对技术表演竞赛工作进行了大检查、大总结和大评比，促进技术表演竞赛的开展。团的组织也在党的统一领导下，作好青年的思想工作，树立典型，发挥了青年的突击作用。（附图片）
