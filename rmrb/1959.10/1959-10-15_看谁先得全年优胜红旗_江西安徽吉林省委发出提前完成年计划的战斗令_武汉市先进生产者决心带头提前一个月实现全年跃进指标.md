Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 13th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a broadcast conference on the 11th, calling on workers on the province's industrial, capital construction, and transportation fronts to complete this year's industrial production and capital construction plans 15 to 20 days ahead of schedule, and to complete this year's transportation plan 20 to 30 days ahead of schedule. At the same time, they should fully prepare the production, capital construction, and transportation plans for the first quarter of next year, ensuring that the production level in the first quarter of next year exceeds that of the fourth quarter of this year.

Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report at the broadcast conference. Yang Shangkui pointed out that by the end of September, the province's industrial production had completed more than 70% of the total annual output value plan. It is estimated that the speed of production development this year will increase by about 40% compared to last year. He said that the favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling the annual leap forward plans for industrial production and capital construction 15 to 20 days ahead of schedule are fully available. Yang Shangkui emphasized that in order to victoriously complete the annual leap forward plan ahead of schedule, it is necessary to continue to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, strengthen enterprise management, practice strict economy, and improve product quality. At the same time, it is necessary to further extensively and deeply carry out socialist labor emulation and strengthen the Party's leadership over the movement.

The call of the Provincial Committee expressed the wishes and determination of the broad masses of workers in the province. They are full of confidence and high morale, and have put forward new goals of struggle to resolutely ensure the realization of the Party's call. More than 90% of the classes, groups, or individuals in the Jiangxi Textile Factory have set their own merit-making projects. Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant proposed: continue to thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost energy, fight hard in the fourth quarter, strive for October to exceed September, one month higher than another, with a daily output of 500 tons of pig iron, and resolutely complete and overfulfill the production task of 54,000 tons of pig iron and 4,800 tons of steel ahead of schedule. The Fengcheng Coal Mine has been reporting good news for several days, and the daily output of coal has risen from 1,488 tons to 1,880 tons.

Our newspaper, Hefei, 14th: The broad masses of workers in Anhui Province are determined to work hard in the fourth quarter and strive to complete the leap forward plan for industrial production this year 10 days to half a month ahead of schedule.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that the workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Anhui Province have achieved great achievements this year on the basis of last year's great leap forward. The total value of industrial production from January to September this year increased by 58.8% compared to the same period last year. Pig iron production reached 1.37 million tons, an increase of 442.1% compared to the same period last year; steel was 100,000 tons, an increase of 874.6%; coal was 11.1 million tons, an increase of 94.7%. Especially after entering September, under the encouragement of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all workers were more energetic, and production quotas continued to be broken. The province's highest daily output of steel reached 1,613 tons, the highest daily output of iron reached 9,071 tons, and the highest daily output of coal reached 65,168 tons.

The situation is very good, but the task in the fourth quarter is very heavy. Therefore, the Provincial Committee requires all localities to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost energy, continue to criticize the fear of difficulties among some cadres, criticize the so-called "conditional theory" that increasing production requires increasing equipment, as well as the erroneous ideas such as "production has reached the top" and "potential has been exhausted," and further deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy. Party organizations at all levels must also adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, adhere to the working method of the mass line, and strengthen the front line of production in order to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. At the same time, the Provincial Committee pointed out that conscientiously summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of all parties is also an important key to ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's leap forward plan. It also requires all industrial departments to cooperate closely, promote each other, and make a leap forward together.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th: The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on workers on the province's industrial and transportation fronts to continue to thoroughly implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, work hard for 80 days, and strive to complete the annual national plan 15 to 20 days ahead of schedule, and prepare for the great leap forward in production and construction next year.

After the publication of the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the industrial and transportation industries in Jilin Province immediately launched a new upsurge of a magnificent mass movement to increase production and practice economy. The province's industrial production, capital construction, and transportation plans for the third quarter were all comprehensively overfulfilled. Among them, the total industrial output value plan was completed by 109%, an increase of 41.3% compared to the same period last year, and the workload of capital construction exceeded the total of the first and second quarters. After the National Day, this movement continued to develop vigorously, and major products such as steel, coal, and timber all overfulfilled the production plans for the first ten days of the month.

The development of the movement shows that the deeper and more thorough the opposition to right-leaning tendencies, the greater and more sufficient the energy, and the more significant the achievements in production and construction. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all workers in the province to advance victoriously, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost energy, and promote the upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy to develop forward persistently and deeply, wave after wave, and strive to complete the province's total annual industrial output value plan 18 days ahead of schedule, complete the annual plans for major products such as pig iron, steel, raw coal, and timber 15 to 70 days ahead of schedule, complete the railway freight volume plan 12 days ahead of schedule, and complete the highway freight volume plan 20 days ahead of schedule. At the same time, effective measures should be taken to ensure that the production level in January next year is not lower than that in December this year, and that the production level in the first quarter of next year is higher than that in the fourth quarter of this year.

In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual plan ahead of schedule, the Provincial Committee pointed out that it is necessary to adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, continue to greatly boost revolutionary energy, and more widely carry out socialist labor emulation among all workers to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced workers. The Provincial Committee also requires leading cadres at all levels to thoroughly overcome right-leaning thoughts and emotions, thoroughly change their leadership style, go deep into the masses to lead the masses, and participate in production to lead production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th: More than 1,100 representatives of advanced producers and advanced collectives in Wuhan City stated at the recently held Wuhan City 1959 Second Advanced Production (Work) Worker Congress: Determined to lead the city's workers to fight for the completion of the annual national plan one month ahead of schedule, and to complete the city's leap forward plan this year ahead of schedule, comprehensively, and overfulfill it.

Since the beginning of this year, especially after the publication of the resolution and communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, great achievements have been made on all economic fronts in Wuhan City. From January to September, the total output value of municipal industries has completed more than 78% of the annual national plan. Since October, a large number of units have achieved a good start, overfulfilled the plans for the first ten days of the month, and production has doubled.

The advanced producers enthusiastically responded to this call. Their guarantee letters and resolutions were posted all around the venue, and representatives from all walks of life launched challenges and responses at the congress.

Many advanced producers responded to the challenge. Wang Tianhou, leader of the motor group of the Changhong Automobile Assembly Plant, which had completed the production task for the first half of 1960 by the end of September, proposed in his response that he and his entire group would achieve ninety technical innovations in the fourth quarter, change all manual operations to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, do the work of ten people with one person, and do the work of ten months in one month, complete 1,000 automobile motors, and leap over 1962.

In order to make the call of the congress quickly become the action of the broad masses of workers in the city, the representatives took time to return to their units during the congress to convey the spirit of the congress and discuss the conditions for the competition. At present, a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy has unfolded in Wuhan City. (Attached pictures)

    江西安徽吉林省委发出提前完成年计划的战斗令
    武汉市先进生产者决心带头提前一个月实现全年跃进指标
    据新华社南昌13日电　中共江西省委在十一日举行广播大会，号召全省工业、基本建设和交通运输战线上的职工，提前十五天到二十天完成今年的工业生产和基本建设计划，提前二十天到三十天完成今年交通运输计划；同时，充分做好明年第一季度的生产、基本建设、交通运输计划和准备工作，保证明年第一季度超过今年第四季度的生产水平。
    中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎在广播大会上作了报告。杨尚奎指出，到9月底止，全省工业生产已经完成全年总产值计划的70％以上。预计今年生产发展的速度，将比去年增长40％左右。他说，提前十五天到二十天完成和超额完成全年工业生产和基本建设跃进计划的有利条件，是充分具备的。杨尚奎强调指出，为了胜利地提前超额完成全年的跃进计划，必须继续认真贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，必须加强企业的管理工作，必须厉行节约，提高产品质量；同时，进一步广泛深入地开展社会主义劳动竞赛，加强党对运动的领导。
    省委的号召，表达了全省广大职工群众的意愿和决心。他们信心百倍，斗志昂扬，提出了新的奋斗目标，坚决保证实现党的号召。江西纺织厂90％以上的班、组或个人，订出了自己的立功项目。南昌钢铁厂提出：继续深入反右倾，鼓干劲，大战第四季度，力争10月超9月，一月高一月，日产生铁五百吨，坚决提前超额完成五万四千吨生铁和四千八百吨钢的生产任务。丰城煤矿连日来生产捷报频传，煤炭日产量由一千四百八十八吨上升到一千八百八十吨。
    本报合肥14日电　安徽省广大职工决心大干第四季度，力争提前十天到半个月完成今年工业生产的跃进计划。
    中共安徽省委指出：安徽省工业交通战线上的职工，今年在去年大跃进的基础上又取得了巨大的成就。今年1至9月份的工业生产总值，比去年同期增长了58.8％。生铁产量达到一百三十七万吨，比去年同期增长了442.1％；钢十万吨，增长874.6％；煤炭一千一百一十万吨，增长了94.7％。特别是进入9月以后，全体职工在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，干劲更足，生产定额不断突破。全省钢的最高日产量达到一千六百一十三吨，铁的日产量最高达到九千零七十一吨，煤炭最高日产量达到六万五千一百六十八吨。
    形势是很好的，但第四季度任务很繁重，因此，省委要求各地必须继续反右倾、鼓干劲，继续批判部分干部中存在的畏难情绪，批判那些所谓增产就要增设备的“条件论”以及“增产到顶”、“潜力挖光”等错误思想，进一步深入地开展增产节约运动。各地党组织还必须坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线的工作方法，加强生产第一线，以便及时发现问题解决问题。同时省委指出认真总结推广各方面的先进经验，也是保证完成和超额完成今年跃进计划的重要关键。并且要求各个工业部门通力合作，相互促进，共同跃进。
    据新华社长春14日电　中共吉林省委号召全省工业和交通运输战线职工继续深入贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，大干八十天，争取提前十五天到二十天完成全年国家计划，并且为明年生产建设大跃进作好准备。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，吉林省工业和交通运输业战线立即掀起了波澜壮阔的增产节约群众运动新高潮。全省第三季度工业生产、基本建设和运输计划都全面超额完成了，其中工业总产值计划完成109％，比去年同期增长41.3％，基本建设工作量超过一、二两季的总和。国庆节后，这一运动继续猛烈发展，钢、煤炭、木材等主要产品都超额完成了上旬生产计划。
    运动发展的情况表明，反右倾反得越深越透，干劲就鼓得越大越足，生产建设成果也就越发显著。中共吉林省委号召全省职工乘胜前进，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，推动增产节约高潮一浪高过一浪地向前持久深入地发展，争取提前十八天完成全省全年工业总产值计划，提前十五天到七十天完成主要产品生铁、钢、原煤、木材的全年计划，提前十二天完成铁路货运量计划，提前二十天完成公路货运量计划。同时，切实采取措施，保证明年1月份的生产水平不低于今年12月份，明年第一季度的生产水平高于今年第四季度。
    为了保证提前超额完成全年计划，省委指出，必须坚持政治挂帅，继续大鼓革命干劲，在全体职工中更广泛地开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的社会主义劳动竞赛。省委还要求各级领导干部彻底克服右倾思想和右倾情绪，彻底转变领导作风，深入群众领导群众，参加生产领导生产。
    据新华社武汉14日电　武汉市一千一百多名先进生产者和先进集体的代表，在最近举行的武汉市1959年第二次先进生产（工作）者代表大会上表示：决心带动全市职工，为提前一个月完成全年国家计划，为提前、全面、超额完成今年全市的跃进计划而斗争。
    今年以来，特别是党的八届八中全会的决议和公报公布以后，武汉市各条经济战线上都取得了巨大成绩。1月至9月，市属工业的总产值已完成全年国家计划78％以上。10月以来，大批单位又实现了开门红，超额完成了上旬计划，生产成倍增长。
    根据这样的大好形势，中共武汉市委在大会上提出了今后的任务，号召全体先进生产者和全市职工，决战第四季度，为提前一个月完成国家计划，提前、全面、超额完成今年全市的跃进计划而斗争，并且积极为1960年的继续大跃进作好准备。
    先进生产者们热烈响应了这一号召。他们的保证书、决心书贴满了会场四周，各行各业代表在大会上展开了挑战应战。全市著名的红旗手、湖北拖拉机厂扳金工徐伯勋首先向全市工人提出挑战，保证在第四季度内实现重大革新五项，做到一人顶两人，提前一个半月全面超额地完成全年的工作量，并且保证全部产品达到质量标准，帮助一个到两个生产小组和本组内的三个工人达到先进水平。许多先进生产者纷纷应战。到9月下旬止已经完成1960年上半年生产任务的长虹汽车制配厂马达组组长王天厚在应战中提出，他和全组要在第四季度内实现技术革新九十项，变全部手工操作为机械化、半机械化操作，做到一人顶十人、一月当十月，完成一千台汽车马达，飞步跨过1962年。
