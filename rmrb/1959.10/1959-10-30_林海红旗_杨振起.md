    Red Banner in the Forest – Yang Zhenqi
    In the green treasure house of our motherland, the forests of the Great Khingan Mountains, countless red banners are planted, and Yang Zhenqi, a timber truck driver from the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau's motor vehicle team, is one of the most noteworthy. Since returning from the Korean War in 1953 and joining the timber transport effort, Yang Zhenqi has been diligent, selfless, unafraid of hardship, and has exceeded his plan every year. During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, he set a national record by transporting 105 cubic meters of timber per vehicle; this year, he led his contracted vehicle team to achieve overall high production, exceeding the annual plan by seven months and nineteen days ahead of schedule.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, workers across the country, inspired by the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," launched technical revolution and technical innovation, and miracles emerged everywhere, with good news constantly coming from all directions. Yang Zhenqi thought, "How can I contribute more to socialism? Others can leapfrog production again and again, doubling and redoubling it. Can't we do the same with timber transport?" Every day, he asked the loading workers to load more for him, usually hauling five cubic meters more than others, reaching thirty cubic meters. In the eyes of others, increasing by five cubic meters was already remarkable, but Yang Zhenqi was not satisfied with his existing achievements. He pondered day and night about how to increase the carrying capacity even more.
    One day, he passed by the railway and saw a long train loaded with timber speeding by like a giant dragon. This gave him a great inspiration. He thought: If trains can be fully loaded and overloaded, can automobiles also implement train-like operations and full loading with overloading? He himself had once made a bold experiment, pulling two trailers with a load of 45 cubic meters, proving that towing trailers had great potential. So, he mustered the courage to ask the leadership to approve his plan to try train-style timber transport. At that time, the Party General Branch of the motor vehicle team was studying how to break the 100-meter timber transport barrier, and immediately supported Yang Zhenqi's proposal, encouraging him to submit a proposal to the comrades in the team. However, some people began to discuss, saying, "The motor vehicle's engine power is insufficient to pull the trailers," "The Xiniqi road is a one-way street with steep slopes and narrow road surfaces, making it prone to accidents." Some individuals even ridiculed him, saying, "Talking on paper won't work. Let's see how Yang Zhenqi shows his stuff!" "If you can pull the timber back, I'll eat it." These cold words did not shake Yang Zhenqi's determination. With the help of the leadership and comrades, he loaded 60 cubic meters for the first time and pulled it back steadily. The second time, he loaded 105 cubic meters and also successfully pulled it back. This greatly strengthened his confidence and determination to fully implement "train-style timber transport." Immediately afterward, Zhao Jingguo and others from the Tulihe Forest Industry Bureau learned from his experience and quickly surpassed him. He then surpassed them again by transporting 200 cubic meters of timber at once. In this way, a competitive upsurge of catching up with each other swept across the entire Great Khingan Mountains automobile transportation line.
    In January of this year, the Great Khingan Mountains were covered in ice and snow, which was the golden season for forestry workers to seize timber from the deep mountains and dense forests. Yang Zhenqi returned from Beijing after attending the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction, and the words of the leaders were still clearly imprinted in his mind. He thought all day: How can I respond to the expectations of the Party and the people with even newer achievements? One day in March, he created a high-yield record of 361 cubic meters. But he thought again: Building socialism is everyone's business. Working alone, no matter how much you do, is not enough. We must unleash everyone's energy. At this time, the Party Committee of the Forest Industry Bureau also issued a call to popularize high-yield records. After much deliberation, Yang Zhenqi realized that using one locomotive for one contracted vehicle team could not facilitate good collaboration. So he suggested to the leadership to merge three vehicles into a mixed contracted vehicle team, implementing fixed-point operations, with each mixed contracted vehicle team contracted to transport timber from one forest farm. In this way, loading and unloading could collaborate with each other. At his suggestion, the forest farm also promoted the experience of assembly line operations. This experience involved preparing three sets of trailers for each vehicle: one set of trailers left at the mountain site for loading, one set of trailers at the lumberyard for unloading, and another set running with the vehicle. This reduced the time cars spent waiting for loading and unloading at the forest farm and lumberyard. Transport efficiency increased from being able to only make two trips a day, to four. Yang Zhenqi’s team adopted this method, strengthened its collaboration with the loading workers at the forest farm, and set a record of transporting 287 cubic meters of timber per vehicle per day – a total of 711 cubic meters among three vehicles. This was more than double the average transportation volume in the same period of 1958, ensuring the completion and surpassing of production targets ahead of schedule.
    Yang Zhenqi pays special attention to vehicle maintenance and safe operation, which is also an important reason why he can overfulfill his tasks. In practice, he has developed a set of "three-handover and four-check" protection methods and safe driving experience. The "three handovers" are handing over the vehicle, handing over the figures, and handing over the key issues. The "four checks" are checks before departure, checks during the trip, checks before leaving the site, and checks before handing over shifts. When taking over the shift, he always arrives early. If he finds any problems with the vehicle, he lets the previous shift comrades rest while he repairs it himself. But when he hands over the shift, he always checks and repairs the vehicle, handing it over to the next shift comrade without any problems. Some comrades do not pay enough attention to trailer maintenance. He uses his spare time to brave wind and snow to repair them, and tells everyone how to take care of the trailers. He also mobilized everyone to establish a dedicated management system, so that everyone pays attention to trailer maintenance. Because of his care for the locomotives, the tow-truck he drove traveled more than 180,000 kilometers safely without major repairs from December 1955 to the end of July 1959, and never had a personal or mechanical accident. According to the standard of overhauling a car every 50,000 kilometers, he has extended the major overhaul period three times, transporting more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber for the country and saving more than 30,000 yuan in major overhaul costs. Not only has his car not been overhauled, but it has only undergone intermediate repairs twice. Under his leadership, the entire car team has achieved a car and trailer operation rate of over 90%.
    Yang Zhenqi also demonstrates the working class's selfless labor, altruism, and the excellent qualities of not fearing hardship and not caring about rewards in his daily actions. In 1957, a new group of demobilized soldiers came to the car team. Because they were not familiar with driving tow-trucks for the first time, Yang Zhenqi took the initiative to join them during his breaks and taught them his experience, so that they quickly improved their skills. In winter, heavy snow covers the road, and some drivers think that the road is not easy to drive and is not safe, and they are unwilling to drive the lead car. He always signs up to drive the lead car and compacts the road first. One night in December last year, locomotive No. 30 broke down on the road, and the locomotives behind were blocked. He immediately helped to repair it and lent one of his lightbulbs to locomotive No. 30. But after locomotive No. 30 drove for a while, the lightbulb burned out, and the driver Yang Junsheng's hand was also injured by the wire cutter while repairing the car. At this time, some people advocated stopping car No. 30 on the road, but Yang Zhenqi thought that if one car pulled one less trip, it would cause losses to the country. He could not let the car stop. So he let Yang Junsheng drive his car, and he went to drive car No. 30, which lacked lighting. Because it was dark and he couldn't see the road clearly, he opened the windshield of the car. The outside temperature was minus 40 to 50 degrees Celsius. The cold wind blew in like needles, and his hands and feet were numb, but he still insisted on driving back to the lumberyard. Although Yang Zhenqi has greatly exceeded the quota for automobile timber transportation, he has always refused to accept the bonuses given to him by the state. He said: "I transport more timber just to contribute more to the cause of socialist construction."

    林海红旗——杨振起
    在祖国的绿色宝库——大兴安岭的林海中，树立着无数面红旗，西尼气林业局汽车大队运材司机杨振起是其中更加引人注意的一个。杨振起自1953年抗美援朝回国参加木材运输以来，勤勤恳恳、忘我劳动、不怕劳累、不避艰苦，年年月月都超额完成了计划。在1958年大跃进中，他创造了每车运材一百零五立方米的全国纪录；今年又带动他所在的包车组，实现了全面高产，提前七个月零十九天超额完成了全年计划。
    在去年大跃进的日子里，全国各地职工在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，大闹技术革命和技术革新，到处出现奇迹，捷报不断从四面八方传来。杨振起想：“怎样才能为社会主义多贡献一份力量呢？别人能把产量一跃再跃，番上加番，难道我们汽车运材就不行吗？”他每天总要求装车工人给他多装，每次一般都要比别人多拉五立方米，达到三十立方米。在别人看来，提高五立方米已经很了不起了，但杨振起并不满足已有的成绩，他昼夜苦思着怎样更高地提高载运量。
    有一天，他路过铁道，迎面开来一长列满载木材的火车，像一条巨龙似的飞驰而过。这给他很大启发。他想：火车可以满载超轴，汽车是不是也可以实行列车化和满载超轴呢？他自己也曾经有过一次大胆的试验，拉了两节拖车，装载量达到四十五立方米，证明搭拖拉汽车还有很大的潜力，于是他鼓起勇气向领导上要求批准他试行列车式运材的计划。当时汽车队党总支正在研究如何突破运材百米大关问题，便立即支持杨振起的倡议，鼓励他向全队同志提出倡议书。这时，有人却议论开了，说：“搭拖拉汽车机能不足，拉不了”，“西尼气的公路是单行线，坡度大，路面窄，容易出事故”。个别的人还讥讽说：“纸上谈兵不行，看杨振起怎样露一手吧！”“你能把木材拉回来，我把它吃了。”这些冷言冷语并没有动摇杨振起的决心。他在领导和同志们的帮助下，第一次装了六十立方米，稳稳当当地拉回来了；第二次又装了一百零五立方米，也胜利地拉了回来。这就大大增强了他全面推行“汽车列车式运材”的信心和决心。紧接着，图里河森林工业管理局的赵经国等学习了他的经验，很快地超过了他，他又以一次运材二百立方米赶过了他们。这样，整个大兴安岭汽车运输线上就掀起了你追我赶的竞赛热潮。
    今年1月，大兴安岭一片冰天雪地，这正是林业职工向深山密林争夺木材的黄金季节。杨振起从北京参加全国社会主义建设积极分子会议回来，首长们的每字每句还清楚地印在他的心里。他整天想：怎样以更新的成绩来回答党和人民的期待呢？3月的一天，他又创造了三百六十一立方米的高产纪录。可是他又想到：建设社会主义是大家的事，只有自己干，干得再多也不行，必须把大家的劲发挥起来。这时，森林工业管理局党委也提出普及高产纪录的号召。杨振起经过一番苦心思索，发现一台机车为一个包车组，不能很好地开展协作，便向领导建议把三台车合并为一个混合包车组，实行定点运行，每个混合包车组包运一个林场的木材。这样，装卸就可以互相协作。在他的倡议下，林场还推行了流水作业的经验。这个经验就是每台车预备三套拖车，一套拖车留在山场装车，一套拖车在贮木场卸车，另一套随车运行。这样就减少了汽车在林场、贮木场等装等卸的时间，运输效率由过去每日只能跑两趟提高到四趟。杨振起包车组采取了这个办法，并加强了与林场装车工人的协作，创造了每台车每日运材二百八十七立方米、三台车共运七百一十一立方米的纪录，比1958年同期平均载运量提高二倍多，因而保证了生产任务的提前和超额完成。
    杨振起特别注意汽车的保养和安全运行，这也是他能够超额完成任务的重要原因。在实践中，他自己摸索出一套“三交四检”保护法和安全行车经验。“三交”是交车子、交数字、交关键，“四检”是出车前检查、途中检查、出场检查、交班前检查。在接班时，他总是提前到达，发现车子有什么毛病，就让上班同志休息，自己修理。可是在他交班时，每次都把车子检查好，修理好，一点毛病没有才交给下一班的同志。有的同志对拖车保养注意不够，他便利用业余时间冒着风雪去修，同时告诉大家应该怎样爱护拖车，并且发动大家订了专责保管制度，使大家都注意保养拖车了。由于他对机车的爱护，他驾驶的搭拖拉汽车从1955年12月到1959年7月末止，安全行驶了十八万多公里无大修，也从未发生过一次人身或机械事故。按汽车出厂五万公里大修一次，他已延长了三次大修期，给国家多运了一万多立方米木材，节约大修费三万多元。他的车不仅没有大修过，中修也只有两次。在他的带动下，他的包车组全体汽车、拖车出车率都达到90％以上。
    杨振起在日常行动中也处处表现了工人阶级忘我劳动，舍己为人和不怕艰苦，不计报酬的优良品质。1957年汽车队新来了一批转业军人，因为他们初次开搭拖拉汽车，不太熟练，杨振起就利用休班时间主动跟车，把自己的经验教给他们，使他们很快提高了技术。冬天大雪复盖汽车道，有的司机嫌道不好走，不安全，不愿意开头车；而他总是报名开头车，先把道压好。去年12月的一个深夜，三十号机车在半道上坏了，后面的机车都被堵住。他马上帮助修理，还把自己的灯泡借一个给三十号机车，但三十号机车开了不大一会，灯泡就烧坏了，司机杨俊生的手也在修车时被丝刀挫伤。这时有人主张把三十号车停放在道上，但杨振起想，如果一台车少拉一趟，会给国家造成损失，他不能让汽车停下来，于是便把自己的车让杨俊生开，自己去开三十号缺少照明的汽车。黑夜看不清道路，他就把汽车的前风挡打开，外面是零下四十至五十度的气候，寒风刮进来，像针一样刺骨，手脚冻麻了，但他仍坚持开回贮木场。杨振起虽然大大超过了汽车运材定量，可是他始终拒绝接受国家给他的奖金。他说：“我多运木材只是想给社会主义建设事业多贡献一些力量。”
