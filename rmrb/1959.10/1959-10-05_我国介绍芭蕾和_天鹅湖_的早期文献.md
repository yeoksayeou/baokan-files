    Early Chinese Documents Introducing Ballet and "Swan Lake"
    A Ying
    As the Soviet State Grand Theatre Ballet comes to China, I would like to take this joyous occasion to discuss the earliest Chinese documents introducing Russian ballet and "Swan Lake," providing some historical materials for Sino-Soviet artistic relations, to express our warm welcome.
    From the discovered materials, it appears that Sino-Russian literary and artistic relations began as early as the 25th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1845). In that year, Russia sent China a copy of "Dimitri's Poetry Collection," a copy of "Krylov's Poetry Collection," sixteen volumes of "Selected Works of Russian Masters," two volumes of "Biographies of One Hundred Russian Writers," and two volumes of "Iliad's Poetry Collection."
    Records of Chinese people seeing Russian dramas appeared as early as the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign (1866). In that year, Bin Chun traveled to Russia, and his "Cheng Cha Notes" (1869) records that on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, he watched "two theatrical performances" in St. Petersburg. It is unknown what kind of plays they were, or whether there was ballet among them.
    It can be stated with certainty that Chinese people saw "ballet" in St. Petersburg as early as the 19th day of the first lunar month of the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (1879). According to Zhang Deyi, the translator of the Chinese Minister Guo Songtao, in "Si Shu Qi" (his diary of his fourth trip abroad in 1883), on the fifth day of the first lunar month, they saw dancing in the Russian palace. "Hundreds of young girls, wearing short skirts, in five colors, divided into groups and lined up in formation, forming circles. Sometimes they fly like swallows and leap like fish, sometimes they soar like swans and swim like dragons, which is very lively and interesting." This should have been ballet. The explicit mention of ballet is in the diary of the 19th day of the first lunar month:
    …That evening, there was dance without song, called "Balleta," meaning also dancing.
    This "Balleta," which is "Ballet," is the first appearance in Chinese records. The Russian Emperor was also present at both performances. The ballet performed on the latter evening had the Arctic as its background, with snowy and icy conditions and polar bears and otters. The opening scene was winter, "young girls dancing, dressed all in white." Suddenly, spring arrived, "the weather was mild, and everything was fresh, young girls dancing, dressed all in green." Then came summer, "the sun was scorching, the clouds were red, the flowers were fragrant, and the trees were dense, young girls dancing, dressed all in red." After that, autumn, "the wind blew, and the leaves fell, the land was desolate, young girls dancing, dressed all in black." Suddenly, "heavy snow and strong winds, ice floes on the sea, a large ship in distress, masts broken and flags torn, people calling for help, the audience was shocked." Finally, the whole scene was brightened up, creating a large garden, "flowers blooming, willows swaying, the water was clear, and the mountains were beautiful. Young girls changed their costumes and danced, moving their steps with the music, turning their bodies with the style, creating a new scene."
    This was clearly a large-scale ballet. As for seeing "dance drama," seeing "Swan Lake," that was in the year of Yi Wei in the Guangxu reign (1895). However, the translated name was not "Swan Lake," but "Hong Chi" (鸿池, literally "Swan Pond"). Russia only staged this play in 1893, so this was the third year. Wang Zhichun's "Shi E Cao" (使俄草, 1895) said that they saw this play at the Moscow Imperial Grand Theatre on the night of the 23rd day of the first lunar month, a snowy night. Yang Yizhi's "E Cheng Ri Ji" (俄程日记, 1905) introduced the plot of Swan Lake in the most detail:
    The famous "Hong Chi." A prince of a certain country seeks marriage with another country. The Emperor of Heaven sends a fairy maiden as his partner, transformed into a swan. Fifty or sixty attendants, all in feather costumes, perform a whirlwind dance. A demon transforms into an owl bird, wanting to force the prince into marriage, and his followers, dozens of them, wear black clothes, exhibiting extreme transformations. The stage is set with curtains, and each act ends with scenes of mountains, forests, pools, and castles, appearing illusory and strange, both real and unreal. More than a hundred musicians play, their voices reaching the sky and shaking the earth. Hundreds of electric lights shine brightly like a painting, making one feel deafened and dizzy.
    The content introduction, although with some errors, still matches the basic situation. Although not without shortcomings, it is worth commemorating these two documents, which used Chinese characters to introduce "Swan Lake" to the Chinese people for the first time. This is already sixty-five years ago. The introduction of ballet is now as long as eighty-one years ago. But the broad masses of the Chinese people were able to see performances by Soviet comrades in their own country only after liberation, in 1954. And the "Swan Lake" at this time was different from the Russian Empire, it was socialist realism, with more popular content. It was seen in the second year after the Soviet Union restaged this ballet. And because of the performances of the Moscow Musical Theatre and the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre in China, as well as the help of Soviet experts, Chinese ballet and new dance dramas have been greatly promoted and developed.
    What must also be said is that in the year of Bing Shen in the Guangxu reign (1896), Chinese people saw another dance drama at the Moscow Imperial Grand Theatre. The content was very similar to the old auspicious celebratory operas in China. That was on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month. The plot of this play, according to Wu Zonglian's "Sui Yao Bi Ji" (随轺笔记), is as follows:
    Before long, the music started, and the painted curtain on the stage was raised, revealing a stone cave with lush trees. One cave was formed of clams, corals, and other objects, colorful and unusually bright. It contained countless exquisite pearl spirits of the great ocean, who were gathering. And the white pearl spirit was in its shell, deeply asleep. Suddenly, a heavenly deity, like a handsome young man, came out of the clouds, radiating light, and slowly descended into the cave. The pearl spirits scattered and hid, and the heavenly deity was greatly disappointed. Suddenly, he saw the white pearl spirit still fast asleep, unable to help but admire it, and he walked forward. But the white pearl spirit suddenly woke up and closed its shell. The heavenly deity pleaded repeatedly, expressing his admiration. The white pearl spirit was finally moved by his sincerity and agreed to come out of its shell. Unexpectedly, the wave god reported to the Coral King, who was the most rigorous protector of the treasures in the sea, and led his troops to arrive. All the pearl spirits trembled and begged for mercy, pleading repeatedly, their words urgent, but the Coral King was stubborn and did not care. The heavenly deity was furious and struck the stone with his staff, and the stone suddenly opened, and the gold, silver, copper, and iron soldiers under the command of the earth god drilled out. Then the Coral and Gold factions fought once in the garden, and the Coral faction was defeated. Just then, the guards watching over the pearls also came to rescue, but they were still repelled. The heavenly deity then held the white pearl spirit hostage. The Coral King and his entire army did not dare to resist. The heavenly deity told the Coral King: "I came here to seek the most beautiful pearl in the world to make a crown." The Coral King then led his followers to surrender to the heavenly deity and the white pearl spirit, and the play ended.
    "Si Shu Qi" also mentioned a play, whether it was a dance drama is unknown. The content involved a farmer napping on a wooden bed, dreaming of riding a cannonball into the sky, entering the moon and meeting fairies, and even reaching Chang'e's side. Sometimes people could be put in a cannonball and fired out. This seems to be adapted from novels such as "A Trip to the Moon," but its adaptation into a play is enough to show the aspirations of the Russian people at that time, and this ideal began to be realized today, more than sixty years later. This is a great event that is worth celebrating and rejoicing, and conducive to consolidating world peace and human happiness!

### 我国介绍芭蕾和“天鹅湖”的早期文献

    我国介绍芭蕾和“天鹅湖”的早期文献
    阿英
    在苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团来到中国的时候，我愿趁这欢愉的日子，来谈谈中国最早介绍俄国芭蕾舞和“天鹅湖”的文献，为中苏艺术关系提供一点史料，借以表示我们的热烈欢迎之意。
    从已发现的资料看，中俄的文学艺术关系，至迟在清道光二十五年（1845）已经开始。这一年，俄国送给中国“底米忒里诗集”一册、“柯里噜幅诗集”一册“俄罗斯名家丛文”十六册、“俄罗斯文人百家传”二册和“依里瓦达诗集”二册。
    中国人看到俄国戏剧，在同治五年（1866），就已见诸载记。这一年，斌桩到俄国游历，他的“乘查笔记”（1869）载，中历6月初6日，他还在彼得堡看过“演剧二次”，不知是那几种戏，其间会不会有芭蕾。
    能以肯定的，是在光绪五年（1879）中历正月19日，中国人就已在彼得堡看到了“芭蕾”。据当时中国公使郭嵩焘的翻译官张德彝在“四述奇”（1883年他第四次出国的日记）里所记，中历正月初5日，他们就在俄宫里看到舞蹈。“幼女百数十人，服短裙，色分五彩，分群列队，作线成环。忽飞燕而鱼跃，忽鸿翥而龙游，殊觉热闹可观”，当是芭蕾。而明明白白注出是芭蕾的，那是正月19日的日记：
    ……是晚舞而不歌，名曰“巴蕾塔”，义亦跳舞也。
    这是“巴蕾塔”，也就是“芭蕾”，见于中国载籍之始。看这两场戏时，俄皇也都在场。后一晚演出的芭蕾，背景是北极，雪地冰天，有白熊水獭。开场是冬天，“幼女跳舞，衣履皆白”。忽然到了春天，“风和日暖，气象一新，幼女跳舞，衣履皆绿”。接着是夏，“赤日烘云，花芳树密，幼女跳舞，衣履皆红”。以后秋，“风吹木落，千里寂寥，幼女跳舞，衣履皆黑”。突然，又“大雪狂风，海浮冻块，大船遭险，桅折旗裂，人呼拯救，观众为之惊骇”。最后通场复明，作一大花园，“花明柳媚，水秀山清。幼女改装跳舞，依乐移步，随式转躯，又换一番景象”。
    这显然是一大型芭蕾。至于看到“舞剧”，看到“天鹅湖”，那是在光绪乙未年（1895）。只是译名不叫“天鹅湖”，叫做“鸿池”。俄国在1893年才排演此剧，这是第三个年头。王之春“使俄草”（1895），说他们在中历1月23日大雪之夜，在莫斯科皇家大戏院看过这本戏，杨宜治“俄程日记”（1905），介绍天鹅湖的情节介绍得最详细：
    出名“鸿池”。有某国太子求亲他国，天帝遣仙女为偶，化为鸿雁。侍女五六十人，皆羽衣，为旋风舞。有妖化鸮鸟，欲强偶储君，其从者亦数十人，衣黑衣，极尽变态。台上设帐幙，每出终，辄为山林池沼城阙之状，恍惚离奇，为真为幻。乐者百余人，其声彻霄拔地。电灯数百，辉朗如画，殊觉耳轰神炫。
    内容介绍，虽有讹误，但基本情况，却还是相符。虽不无缺点，总是用中国文字，向中国人第一次介绍“天鹅湖”的值得纪念的两篇文献。这离现在已经是六十五个年头了。至芭蕾的介绍，离现在竟已达到了八十一年之久。而广大中国人民，能以在自己国土上，看到苏联同志们演出，那是解放后，即1954年的事。而这时的“天鹅湖”，已不同于帝国时代的俄国，是社会主义现实主义，更富有人民性的内容了。并且是在苏联重排这个舞剧的第二年就已经看到。也就由于国立莫斯科音乐剧院这一回来中国的演出，以后新西伯利亚歌舞剧院来中国的演出，以及苏联专家们的帮助，中国的芭蕾、新舞剧得到了很大的推动和发展。
    还须说到的，就是光绪丙申年（1896），中国人在莫斯科皇家大戏院，还看到另外一部舞剧。内容很像中国旧时的吉日承应戏。那是中历4月初6日。这部戏的情节，据吴宗濂“随轺笔记”所述，是这样的：
    “无何乐作，戏台上画幔卷起，现出树木葱翠之石洞。一洞系蛤蜊，珊瑚等物结成，五光十色，异样鲜明。中藏大洋之绝美珠精无数，正在聚会。而白珠精在壳，睡意甚酣。忽一天神如美少年者，自云端出，光芒四射，直向洞间冉冉而下。各各珠精纷纷躲避，天神大失所望。忽见白珠精依然熟睡，不胜歆慕，遂信步向前。而白珠精忽醒，即闭其壳。天神再四央求，自伸歆慕之意。白珠精始感其诚，允即出壳。不意浪神报知珊瑚大王，王固为海中宝物防护最严者，率兵大至。各珠精无不股栗乞恩，哀恳再三，情词迫切，而珊瑚大王悍然不顾。天神大恚，以杖击石，石忽洞开，钻出地神所统之金银铜铁兵。于是珊瑚及金类两阵对园交绥一次，而珊瑚败绩。适有看守珍珠之卫队亦来救援，仍被击退。天神乃将白珠精抵住。珊瑚大王及其全军俱不敢抗。天神告珊瑚大王曰：此来系欲寻天下最美之珠以作冕旒。珊瑚大王遂向天神及白珠精率众投诚，而戏亦毕”。
    “四述奇”还说到一本戏，是否为舞剧不可知。内容系演一农民在木榻昼眠，梦驾炮弹上天，入月遇仙，还到了嫦娥身边。有时人可以放在炮弹筒里，射将出去。这似乎是根据“月球旅行”一类小说改编的，但演成戏剧，已足见当时俄国人民的一种想望，这种理想在六十余年后的今日开始实现了。这是多么值得祝贺与高兴，而有利于巩固世界和平，人类幸福的伟大事件啊！
