Formerly saline-alkali land, today's rice granary.
Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area Improves Soil, Cultivated Land Doubles, Grain Production Increases Significantly

(Our report) The Hui and Han commune members in the Yellow River Irrigation Area of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have achieved remarkable results in soil improvement, leading to a leap in agricultural production. This year, the irrigation area not only achieved a bumper harvest of summer wheat but also saw a significant increase in autumn rice production. The 800,900 mu of wheat sown by people of all ethnic groups here achieved an average yield of 410 jin per mu, an increase of 36% compared to last year. The more than 820,000 mu of rice sown achieved an average yield of over 400 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Other crops such as corn and millet have also achieved significant increases in production.

The Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area stretches over 600 li in length, and the history of Yellow River irrigation dates back more than 2,000 years. However, before liberation, due to disrepair of canals and the lack of drainage facilities, the groundwater level rose, and soil salinization became increasingly serious. Low-lying areas turned into lakes of all sizes, and many fertile fields became alkaline flats. 69% of the cultivated land had varying degrees of salinization. Some fields simply did not sprout after sowing. As a result, the cultivated land area shrank from the original 2.2 million mu to just over 1.5 million mu, and the average yield of grain per mu was only 100 to 150 jin.

After liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, people of all ethnic groups vigorously excavated drainage projects and improved the soil. Last year, the realization of people's communes in the countryside created extremely favorable conditions for fundamentally controlling saline-alkali disasters. Encouraged by the superiority of the people's communes, people of all ethnic groups were determined to turn "Yinchuan into Jinchuan, and alkaline rivers into rice granaries." From last autumn to this spring, in addition to adjusting interplanted land, adjusting crop planting according to different soils, and rationally planning and utilizing land, the people's communes mobilized hundreds of thousands of laborers to carry out a soil improvement movement centered on the construction of drainage projects and deep plowing of land. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives wanted to build a larger drainage ditch, but due to the small scope and weak strength of the cooperatives, the difficulties could not be resolved. After communization, due to the large-scale cooperation between teams and communes, people braved the severe cold, dug through frozen soil, excavated drainage projects, and carried out deep plowing of land, bringing the soil salinization improvement work into a new stage of comprehensive control. Now, in this irrigation area, 39 main and branch drainage ditches have been completed, with a total length of 842 kilometers, and more than 2,800 larger branch and capillary ditches have been completed, with a length of more than 3,000 kilometers. After these main ditches, branch ditches, and tens of thousands of large and small branch capillary ditches were completed, a relatively complete drainage network has been basically formed, lowering the groundwater level in more than 2.2 million mu of farmland, and turning 1.7 million mu of alkaline flats, lakes, and swamps into fertile fields, expanding the cultivated land area in the irrigation area by more than double compared to the early days of liberation. At the same time, large-scale deep plowing of land and increased application of fertilizer have also played a significant role in improving the soil. Last autumn and winter, more than 2 million mu of land were deeply plowed in the plains, of which half were deeply plowed to about one chi, and fertilizer application was generally increased. Many fields with very heavy salinity have experienced a leap in production, some increasing by one or two times. In the area north of Yinchuan, which had previously been low-lying and poorly drained, rice cultivation was rare. This year, after repairing channels, digging ditches for drainage, and adopting methods such as removing clear and turbid water to improve the soil, the 200,000 mu of rice that was expanded and planted all achieved increased production.

In the past, many successful experiences created by Hui and Han farmers in the struggle against soil salinization, such as spreading sand to suppress alkali, harrowing in early spring, loosening soil after rain, and crop rotation, have also been further promoted this year. In particular, after communization, in terms of irrigation, the implementation of planned water use and advanced measures such as shallow irrigation and ridge irrigation has changed the habit of flooding irrigation, which has also played a significant role in improving soil salinization.

### 昔日盐碱地　今日米粮川  宁夏黄河灌区改良土壤，耕地扩大一倍，粮食显著增产

    昔日盐碱地　今日米粮川
    宁夏黄河灌区改良土壤，耕地扩大一倍，粮食显著增产
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区黄河灌溉区的回汉族社员，在改良土壤方面已获得卓越成绩，使农业生产飞跃发展。今年这个灌溉区，不仅获得了夏季小麦大丰收，而且秋季水稻也有很大增产。各族社员在这里播种的八十万零九千多亩小麦，平均亩产达到四百一十斤，比去年增产三成六；播种的八十二万多亩水稻，平均亩产四百斤以上，比去年增产四成。其他如玉米、糜谷等作物，也都获得显著增产。
    宁夏黄河灌溉区纵长六百多里，引黄灌溉历史已有两千多年。但是解放前由于渠道失修，没有排水设施，地下水位上升，土壤盐碱化愈来愈严重。低洼的地方变成了大大小小的湖泊，许多良田变成碱滩，69％的耕地都有程度不同的盐碱化，有些田地下种后根本不出苗，因此耕地面积由原来的二百二十万亩，缩小到一百五十多万亩，粮食平均亩产量只有一百斤到一百五十斤。
    解放以后，各族人民在党和政府的领导与扶助下，大力开挖排水工程，改良土壤。去年农村实现人民公社化以后，又为根治盐碱灾害创造了极为有利的条件；各族人民在人民公社优越性的鼓舞下，决心要把“银川变金川，碱川变成米粮川”。去年秋天到今年春天，各人民公社除了调整插花地，根据不同土壤调整作物种植，合理规划和利用土地外，共出动数十万人的劳动大军，展开了以兴修排水工程和深翻土地为中心的改良土壤运动，过去许多农业社想兴修一条较大的排水沟，但由于社的范围小，力量单薄，解决不了困难。公社化以后，由于队与队、公社与公社之间展开了大协作，人们冒着严寒，掘开冻土，开挖排水工程和进行了深翻土地的工作，使土壤盐碱化的改良工作进入了一个全面根治的新阶段。现在这个灌溉区里已修成的排水干沟和支干沟有三十九条，总长八百四十二公里，修成的较大的支毛沟有二千八百多条，长三千多公里。这些干沟、支沟和数以万计的大小支毛沟修通以后，已基本上形成了一个较完整的排水网，使二百二十多万亩田地降低了地下水位，有一百七十万亩的碱滩、湖泊和沼泽变成了良田，使灌溉区耕地面积比解放初期扩大了一倍多。同时由于大规模的深翻土地和增施肥料，对改良土壤也起了很大作用。去年秋冬平原深翻土地达到二百余万亩，其中有一半深翻一尺左右，施肥量普遍增加，很多盐碱很重的田地产量飞跃增长，有的增加一两倍。银川以北地区，过去由于地势低洼，排水不利，很少种植水稻，今年经过整修渠道、开沟排水以及采取撤清澄浑等办法改良土壤，扩大种植的二十万亩水稻都获得增产。
    过去回汉族农民在和土壤盐碱化作斗争中所创造的许多成功经验，如铺沙压碱，早春耙耱、雨后松土、水旱轮作等，今年也得到进一步的推广。特别是公社化以后，在灌溉方面，由于实行了计划用水和浅灌、畦灌等先进措施，改变了大水漫灌习惯，这对改良土壤盐碱化也起了很大作用。
