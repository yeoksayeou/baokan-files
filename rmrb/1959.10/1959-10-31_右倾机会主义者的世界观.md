    Everyone knows that the bourgeoisie, like all exploiting classes in history, are extreme individualists. They always put their personal interests first when observing and considering all issues. Whatever is inconsistent with "my" interests and "my" feelings, good becomes bad, truth becomes untruth, existence becomes non-existence; conversely, whatever is consistent with "my" interests and "my" feelings, bad must become good, error must become truth, and non-existence becomes existence. In this way, one cannot but fall into the point of reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong. This attitude and viewpoint of approving what conforms to one's subjective wishes and opposing what does not, develops to the extreme and becomes solipsism.

    Why is it that when the brilliance of the General Line makes domestic and foreign enemies tremble, when the Great Leap Forward movement has achieved unprecedented victories in our country, and when the superiority of the rural people's communes has become evident and the people's communes have embarked on a path of sound development, those very few right-wing opportunists stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement are the inevitable products of social development in our country, and in their minds and eyes everything is a mess and pitch black? The fundamental problem is that they do not draw conclusions in accordance with the laws of social development based on objective analysis, but rather judge things based on their subjective wishes. Some right-wing opportunist elements, after being criticized by the Party, describe their erroneous thinking as "empiricism." In fact, the essence of their "empiricism" is to take their own feelings, experiences, and the like as the subject, and to base everything on their own feelings and experiences as the basis for judging existence and right and wrong. This kind of "empiricism" is not the kind of empiricism that materialists before Marxism believed in, that "only sensory knowledge is reliable and rational knowledge is unreliable," but is downright bourgeois subjective idealism. This kind of "empiricism" develops to the extreme, which is solipsism.

    Since the bourgeois standpoint is an individualistic standpoint, it naturally limits their vision, making it impossible for them to observe problems comprehensively and dialectically. Since the bourgeoisie is a declining class, standing on such a class standpoint and using this class's worldview to look at problems, of course, there can be no revolutionary vigor of forging ahead, and of course, they cannot be proponents of continuous revolution, and cannot always stand on the side of new emerging forces. This bourgeois standpoint makes them only see the world as a random accumulation of a large pile of things that are unconnected, isolated from each other, and never changing. Their worldview is inextricably linked to metaphysical viewpoints. Those with right-leaning thoughts are always afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, looking back every three steps, worried and anxious, so lacking in confidence. From the perspective of ideological methods, it is that they see difficulties as too serious to be overcome, and do not look at or underestimate favorable conditions, especially those favorable conditions that will appear through human efforts. However, from the aspect of worldview, this way of looking at problems precisely reflects the bourgeois metaphysical worldview. Those bourgeois revolutionaries, when the spearhead of the revolution was still directed at imperialism and its running dogs, although they also wavered, they were generally able to stand on the side of the new emerging forces and actively participate in the revolution, but once the spearhead of the revolution increasingly turned to eradicating the system of all class oppression and class exploitation and its influence, they were frightened, shouting "can't be touched," and immediately stood on the side of the decadent forces in an attempt to stop the progress of the revolution. Thus, these people who once carried the banner of revolution often fall into the quagmire of right-wing or right-wing opportunists under the domination of their class standpoint and their worldview.

    Since the bourgeois standpoint is individualistic and is in opposition to the broad masses of the working people, of course, they will not recognize that the people are the creators of history and the driving force for promoting historical progress. On the contrary, their class standpoint puts themselves above the masses, seeing the masses as a mob. They not only cannot understand the revolutionary drive and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, but they are also very afraid of this drive and enthusiasm of the masses. If the revolutionary movement of the masses is compared to sunlight, they are like owls who cannot stand a bit of sunlight. Because, if the masses are truly mobilized, their individualistic standpoint will be attacked, and they can no longer maintain their privileges. As Marx ridiculed, "The bourgeoisie cannot help but fear the stupidity of the people when the people are still conservative, but when the people become revolutionary, they fear the people's awakening." Therefore, we should not regard the behavior of some right-wing opportunists in seizing on certain shortcomings in the two great revolutionary mass movements of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958 and attacking these two great revolutionary mass movements as accidental events, but should regard them as a reflection of the bourgeois worldview and a reflection of the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

### 右倾机会主义者的世界观

    右倾机会主义者的世界观
    大家知道，资产阶级同历史上的一切剥削阶级一样，是极端的个人主义者。他们总是把自己个人的利益放在第一位来观察和考虑一切问题。凡是与“我”的利益、“我”的思想感情不相一致的，好的就变成坏的，真理就变成不是真理，存在的就变成不存在；反之，凡是与“我”的利益、“我”的思想感情相一致的，坏的要变成好的，谬误要变成真理，不存在也变成了存在。这样，当然不能不落到颠倒黑白、混淆是非的地步。这种合乎自己主观意愿就赞成，不合乎自己主观意愿就反对的态度和观点，发展到极端，就成为唯我主义。
    为什么当总路线的光辉射得国内外敌人发抖的时候，当大跃进运动取得了我国史无前例的大胜利的时候，当农村人民公社的优越性已经明显地表现出来并且人民公社已经走上健全发展道路的时候，那些极少数的右倾机会主义者却偏偏会不承认总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动是我国社会发展的必然产物，在他们的头脑里、眼睛里都是一团乱麻、一片漆黑呢？根本问题，是由于他们不是根据客观分析得出合乎社会发展规律的结论，而是根据他们的主观意愿来判断事物的。有些右倾机会主义分子，在受到党的批判以后，把自己的错误思想说成是“经验主义”。其实，他们的“经验主义”的实质，就是把自己的感觉、经验之类作为主体，一切以他们自己的感觉、经验来作为判断有无和是非的根据。这种“经验主义”，并不是马克思主义以前的唯物主义者所认为的“只有感性认识可靠、理性认识靠不住的”那种经验主义，而是道道地地的资产阶级的主观唯心主义。这种“经验主义”发展到极端，也就是唯我主义。
    资产阶级的立场，既然是个人主义的立场，当然就限制了他们的视野，使他们不可能全面地、辩证地去观察问题。资产阶级既然是一个没落的阶级，站在这样的阶级立场上，用这种阶级的世界观来看问题，当然也不可能有什么勇往直前的革命朝气，当然不可能是不断革命论者，不可能永远站在新生力量的一边。这种资产阶级的立场，使他们只能把世界看成是一大堆互不联系、各自孤立、永不变化的东西的偶然堆集。他们的世界观便和形而上学的观点也结了不解之缘。那些有右倾思想的人们，老是前怕狼、后怕虎，一步三回首，忧心忡忡，那样的缺乏信心，从思想方法上来说，是他们把困难看得过于严重以为不可克服，对于有利条件不去看或者估计太少，特别是不去估计那些经过人的努力将会出现的有利条件。但是，从世界观方面来说，这种看问题的观点，正是反映了资产阶级形而上学的世界观。那些资产阶级的革命家们，当革命的矛头还对着帝国主义及其走狗的时候，他们虽然也有动摇，一般还是能够站在新生力量这一边积极参加革命的，但是，一旦革命的矛头越来越转向要连根消灭一切阶级压迫、阶级剥削的制度及其影响的时候，他们便心惊肉跳，大叫“动不得”，立即站到腐朽力量一边来企图阻止革命的前进了。于是，这一些曾经打着革命旗帜的人们，便往往在他们的阶级立场和他们的世界观的支配之下，堕入右派或右倾机会主义者的泥坑了。
    资产阶级的立场，既然是个人主义的，既是与广大的劳动群众处于对立地位的，当然便不会承认人民群众是历史的创造者和推动历史前进的动力。恰恰相反，他们那种阶级立场，使他们把自己放在群众之上，把群众看成是群氓。他们不仅不可能理解群众的革命干劲和革命热情，而且非常害怕群众的这种干劲和热情。如果把群众的革命运动比作阳光的话，他们正像猫头鹰那样见不得一点阳光。因为，群众如果真正地发动起来，他们那种个人主义的立场，便要受到攻击，不能再保持他们的特权了。正如马克思所嘲笑的那样：“资产阶级当民众还是保守的时候，是不免要害怕民众愚钝的，而在民众一旦变得革命的时候，却又要害怕民众觉悟了”。因此，我们对于一些右倾机会主义者，抓住1958年大跃进和人民公社化两个伟大的革命群众运动中的某些缺点，大肆攻击这两个伟大的革命群众运动的行为，不应当看成是偶然的事件，而应该看成是资产阶级世界观的反映，是资产阶级与无产阶级斗争的反映。
