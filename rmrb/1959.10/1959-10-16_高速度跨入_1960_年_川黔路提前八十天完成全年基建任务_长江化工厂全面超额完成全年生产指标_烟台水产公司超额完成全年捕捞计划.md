Striding into 1960 at High Speed

　　Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Completes Annual Capital Construction Task Eighty Days Ahead of Schedule
　　Yangtze Chemical Plant Comprehensively Overfulfills Annual Production Targets　Yantai Aquatic Products Company Overfulfills Annual Fishing Plan

　　(Our report) Tens of thousands of workers, fighting day and night on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, have once again completed the annual national capital construction plan eighty days ahead of schedule with a heroic spirit that swallows mountains and rivers.

　　The construction task of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway this year is greater than in the past few years. The actual amount of earthwork alone is more than twice the total amount completed from 1956 to 1958. If these earthworks were laid into a levee one meter high and one meter wide, it could pave four lanes from Guiyang to Beijing. At present, the total earthwork of the entire line has completed 68.6%, and the tunnel project has completed 75.6%.

　　Putting politics in command, thoroughly opposing right-leaning tendencies, and carrying out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements are important reasons for completing this year's national plan ahead of schedule. At the beginning of this year, the Guiyang Railway Bureau Party Committee resoundingly put forward the slogan "Maintain the vigor and strive for the upstream." Especially after the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the enthusiasm of the workers was greatly encouraged, bringing about a new situation in capital construction work in August and September. In these two months, all engineering offices overfulfilled the national plan. This year, due to the continuous reform and creation of construction tools, the entire line has basically eliminated the phenomenon of manual carrying and lifting. Among them, there are small trains modified from old jeeps and water pumps, which increase work efficiency by 280 times, and there are more than 110 different types of tipper cars, electric and internal combustion tamping machines. Many working points have further connected these machines one after another in production to form a coordinated operation line of digging, loading, transporting, spreading, filling, and tamping, which greatly saves manpower and improves work efficiency.

　　The leap forward situation of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway this year has received attention from relevant parties. The Ministry of Railways of the Central Government held a national on-site meeting for rapid tunnel construction at Liangfengya, promoting the advanced experience of Liangfengya Tunnel and other tunnels on the Sichuan-Guizhou line.

　　Now, all the workers on the line have started working on the 1960 tasks. A production increase and economy movement with the content of "high yield, high quality, and low cost" is being carried out vigorously on the construction site.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 15th: Chongqing Yangtze Chemical Plant's production has been rising steadily this year, and it has comprehensively overfulfilled all annual production targets ahead of schedule in September. By the end of September, the plant had increased production worth more than 170,000 yuan for the country. On October 9th, the plant's workers ambitiously proposed to increase production by more than 650,000 yuan for the country in the last quarter of this year.

　　The main products of the Yangtze Chemical Plant are stearic acid and stearate salts. Last year, there were only two varieties, but this year it has increased to six, and has also increased the production of new products such as aldehyde esters and calcium carbide. At the beginning of this year, the plant resolutely implemented the policy of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," and continuously overcame right-leaning conservative ideas and slack emotions, launching an opponent competition throughout the plant. Workers chased each other, non-stop. After August, new records appeared every day. Like the three shifts in the distillation process of the stearic acid workshop, they chased each other, with each shift's output exceeding the other. Now the production efficiency of each shift in this process has increased from an average of 800 kilograms to more than 1,000 kilograms, with the highest reaching 1,242 kilograms, creating an unprecedented new record for the plant.

　　"Where there is a key, there are leading cadres; where there is a problem, it is solved in time." The leading cadres of this plant insisted on using the method of dividing up the testing fields by work type, grasping tightly step by step, and deepening layer by layer, so that production increased month by month and quarter by quarter.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 15th: Yantai Aquatic Products Company has overfulfilled this year's fishing plan eighty-five days ahead of schedule, catching a total of 29,058 tons of fish and shrimp, an increase of nearly 55% compared with the same period last year. All employees are determined to increase the production of fish and shrimp by another 7,500 tons in the last eighty days of the fourth quarter, and strive to overfulfill the October leap forward plan five days ahead of schedule, to present a gift to the National "Conference of Heroes."

　　This company implemented the Party's General Line this year and continued to carry out mass movements on a large scale. At the beginning of the year, the company's Party committee comprehensively summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and launched a "six comparisons" competition movement centered on high quality and high yield among all employees, ensuring the overfulfillment of the first quarter plan. In late August, after the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the leading cadres criticized right-leaning sentiments, further boosting the enthusiasm of the workers, and setting off a production increase competition between teams and ships, completing the task of increasing fish and shrimp production by 4,500 tons before National Day nine days ahead of schedule.

　　The employees of various factories and departments under the company have also served as "logistical soldiers" for fishery production. From January to September, the shipyard repaired 46 fishing vessels, the net factory made more than 99,000 kilograms of nets, the transportation and sales department handled more than 100 million jin of fish, and the processing factory pickled and dried more than 5,500 tons of fish. By the end of September, the company's annual output value, profit, labor productivity and other plans had also been overfulfilled. (Attached photo)

### 高速度跨入1960年  川黔路提前八十天完成全年基建任务  长江化工厂全面超额完成全年生产指标　烟台水产公司超额完成全年捕捞计划

　　高速度跨入1960年
    川黔路提前八十天完成全年基建任务
    长江化工厂全面超额完成全年生产指标　烟台水产公司超额完成全年捕捞计划
    本报讯　日夜奋战在川黔铁路上的数万名职工，又以气吞山河的英雄气概，提前八十天完成了全年国家基建计划。
    川黔铁路今年的建设任务，比过去几年都大，仅土石方一项，实际完成的数量，就比1956年到1958年所完成的总数多一倍以上；要是把这些土石铺成一米高、一米宽的长堤，可以从贵阳到北京铺四道。目前，全线土石方的总工程量已经完成了68.6％，隧道工程已完成了75.6％。
    政治挂帅，彻底反右倾，加上开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是提前完成今年国家计划的重要原因。今年年初，贵阳铁路局党委就响亮地提出了“干劲一鼓再鼓，上游一争再争”的口号；特别是在党的八届八中全会的文件公布以后，职工的干劲受到了很大的鼓舞，使8、9两月的基建工作出现了新的局面，各工程处在这两个月都超额完成了国家计划。今年由于不断改革和创造施工工具，整个线路已基本上消除了人挑、抬、背的现象。其中有提高工效二百八十倍的、用旧吉普车、抽水机改装的小火车，有不同类型的翻箱车、电动和内燃打夯机等，共达一百几十种之多。不少的工点，更进一步把这些机具在生产中一种接一种的衔接起来，形成挖、装、运、散、填、夯的联动作业线，大大节约了人力，提高了工效。
    川黔铁路今年的跃进局面，受到了有关方面的重视。中央铁道部曾在凉风垭召开了全国铁路隧道快速施工现场会议，推广了凉风垭隧道及川黔线上其他几个隧道的先进经验。
    现在，全线职工已着手干1960年的活了。工地上正轰轰烈烈地开展以“高产、优质、低成本”为内容的增产节约运动。
    新华社重庆15日电　重庆长江化工厂今年生产步步上升，9月份就已全面提前超额完成了全年各项生产指标。到9月底止，全厂共为国家增产了十七万多元。10月9日，这个厂的职工又雄心勃勃地提出，要在今年的最后一个季度为国家再增产六十五万多元。
    长江化工厂的主要产品是硬脂酸和硬脂酸盐类，去年只有两个品种，今年增加到六个，并且增加了醛酯、电石等新产品的生产。这个厂今年一开始就坚决贯彻了“一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的方针，并且不断克服右倾保守思想和松劲情绪，在全厂掀起了兵对兵、将对将的对手竞赛。职工们你追我赶，马不停蹄。8月份以后，更是天天出现新纪录。像硬脂酸车间蒸馏工序的三个班，你追我赶，班产量一个超过一个，现在这个工序各班的生产效率，已经由平均产八百公斤提高到一千公斤以上，最高的达到一千二百四十二公斤，创造了这个厂空前未有的新纪录。
    “哪里有关键，哪里就有领导干部；哪里有问题，就在哪里及时解决”，这个厂的领导干部就是这样坚持用分工种试验田的办法，步步抓紧，层层抓深，使得生产逐月逐季上升。
    据新华社济南15日电　烟台水产公司已提前八十五天超额完成了今年的捕捞计划，共捕鱼虾二万九千零五十八吨，比去年同期增产近55％。全体职工决心在第四季度最后的八十多天中，再增产鱼虾七千五百吨，并力争提前五天超额完成10月份的跃进计划，向全国“群英大会”献礼。
    这个公司今年贯彻党的总路线，继续大搞群众运动。公司党委年初全面总结了1958年大跃进的经验，在全体职工中开展了以优质高产为中心的“六比”竞赛运动，保证了第一季度计划的超额完成。8月下旬，党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，领导干部批判了右倾情绪，进一步鼓足了职工干劲，掀起了队与队、船与船之间的增产竞赛热潮，提前九天完成了在国庆节前增产鱼虾四千五百吨的任务。
    这个公司所属各厂和各科室职工也当好了渔业生产的“后勤兵”。1月至9月，修船厂修理渔轮四十六条，网厂制网九万九千多公斤，运销部门处理鱼货一亿多斤，加工厂腌制干制鱼货五千五百多吨。到9月底止，全公司的年度产值、利润、劳动生产率等计划也都超额完成。（附图片）
