Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th October. The Bulgarian national men's basketball team played a friendly match with the Hebei team in Tianjin this evening and won with a score of 72 to 62. More than 5,000 spectators in Tianjin watched the exciting basketball game with great interest. The Hebei team, with its quick and agile movements, took the offensive after the opening and initially led with a score of 4-0. The visiting team then quickly reversed the situation with lightning-fast fast breaks. With the tacit cooperation of Mirchev, who is 2.01 meters tall, and center Kanayev, they scored repeatedly. After tying the score at 5, they took the lead and continued to lead. By the end of the first half, they were leading by eight points, with a score of 37-29.
	In the second half, the Hebei team adopted a half-court zone defense and half-court man-to-man defense tactic, launching a fierce counterattack. Wang Jiazhen, who is 1.9 meters tall, jumped high and caught the ball accurately when competing for rebounds with the visiting team, constantly receiving cheers from the audience. An Yuping and Zhang Chuntai also scored repeatedly when cutting into the opponent's defense to shoot, once closing the gap to 50-55 with eight minutes remaining in the game. At this time, Savov, a player of the visiting team who was very accurate with mid-range shots, came on the court. He and G. Panov scored by using mid-range and long-range shots under the strict defense of the Hebei team. Until the last minute, although the Hebei team still stubbornly launched attacks, under the defense of the Bulgarian players whose average height was over 1.9 meters, they often did not get the opportunity to shoot under the basket, and finally lost to the visiting team by a margin of ten points.

    保篮球队在天津胜河北队
    新华社天津9日电　保加利亚国家男子篮球队，今天晚上在天津和河北队举行友谊比赛，以七十二比六十二获胜。天津市的五千多名观众，怀着极大的兴趣观看了这场精彩的篮球赛。动作快速灵巧的河北队，在开球后采取攻势，起初以四比零领先。客队接着以闪电式的快攻很快地扭转了战局。在身高二米零一的米尔契夫和中锋卡涅夫的默契配合下连连得分，打成五平以后，着着领先。到上半场结束时，以三十七比二十九领先八分。
    下半场河北队采取了半场联防半场盯人的战术，发动猛烈反攻，身高一米九的王家祯在和客队争夺篮板球时跳得高，接的准，不断受到观众的喝采。安玉平和张春泰在切进对方的防线投篮时，也屡屡得分，在距离终场八分钟时曾追到五十比五十五。这时客队中距离投篮非常准确的萨沃夫上场，他和格·帕诺夫在河北队严密防守的情况下，采取中距离和远距离投篮的方法得分。直到最后一分钟，河北队虽然仍是顽强地发动进攻，但在上场队员平均身高一米九十以上的保加利亚队员的防守下，在篮下往往得不到投篮的机会，终于以十分之差败给了客队。
