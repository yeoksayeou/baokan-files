    Strive for Greater Victories in the Second Decade
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. The people of all nationalities of our country and all our friends around the world are jubilantly celebrating this glorious festival of great historical significance.
    Ten years ago today, Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in our country, solemnly declared the birth of the People's Republic of China to the world. From then on, China entered a new era in history. Ten years, this is only a brief moment in human history, but in our newborn People's Republic, earth-shaking great changes have taken place. These are ten years of brilliant achievements made by 650 million people on the front lines of socialist revolution and socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and ten years of great victory for Marxism-Leninism in China.
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China ended the dark rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, opened up a new era in which the people of our country control their own destiny, broke through the imperialist front in the East, and greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. From this time on, China entered a new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    In the first three years after the founding of the country (1950-1952), we continued to thoroughly complete the historical tasks of the democratic revolution, liberated all the territory of the mainland, thoroughly eliminated the remnant bandits, realized land reform throughout the country, and carried out the restoration of the national economy. At the same time, the great socialist revolution began. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan from 1953 to 1957, we completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce on the one hand, and carried out the rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in 1957 on the other hand, and carried out large-scale socialist construction. Since 1958, our country has entered the period of the Second Five-Year Plan. In this year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our national economy achieved an unprecedented great leap forward, and the rural areas throughout the country realized the people's commune system. In 1959, our national economy continued to leap forward, and the people's commune movement embarked on the road of consolidation, soundness and development.
    In this way, in just ten years, the social face of our country has undergone tremendous changes. The situation in which multiple economic components coexisted has been replaced by a single socialist economy. The socialist revolution has not only achieved a complete and thorough victory on the economic front, but also achieved decisive victories on the political and ideological fronts. Our economic construction and cultural construction have already experienced leap-forward development. The preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization has already been laid. With the completion of this year's national economic plan, the total output value of industrial and agricultural production in our country will increase by 4.3 times compared with 1949, of which industrial output value will increase by 10.7 times and agricultural output value will increase by 1.5 times. Our country's steel production will increase from 158,000 tons in 1949 to a planned number of 12 million tons this year, an increase of 74 times; coal production will increase from more than 32 million tons to 335 million tons, an increase of 9.3 times; grain production will increase from 216.2 billion jin in 1949 to 550 billion jin this year, an increase of 1.5 times; cotton will increase from 8.89 million dan to 46.2 million dan, an increase of 4.2 times. The number of students in universities and colleges in 1958 increased by 4.7 times compared with 1949, the number of students in secondary schools increased by 8.5 times, primary education has been basically popularized in most counties, and the number of students has increased by 2.5 times. With the upsurge of economic construction and cultural construction, the material and cultural living standards of the people of our country have been greatly improved.
    Through the hard work of the people of our country in the past ten years, although our country has not completely gotten rid of the "poor and blank" situation, the great achievements of the past ten years eloquently show that the independent, strong, prosperous, and socialist New China has not only gained a firm foothold in the world, but is also leaping forward at a speed that capitalist countries cannot match. Imperialism and all reactionaries have cursed New China thousands of times, they have predicted and hoped that New China would neither be able to recover from the wounds of war nor be able to carry out large-scale construction, and they have always dogmatically said that New China must collapse. All of this has burst like soap bubbles. China's great revolution and great leap forward have not only fundamentally changed the face of China, but also inevitably produced a profound and increasingly strong impact in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America similar to old China, because this great revolution and great leap forward occurred in an economically and culturally backward country that was originally semi-feudal and semi-colonial. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is the greatest event in human history after the October Socialist Revolution, and its far-reaching world significance becomes increasingly clear with the passage of time. This is why our people are so jubilant when celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of their republic. This is also why all progressive mankind, all oppressed people, and all peace-loving people in the world are so excited about the victories and achievements of the Chinese people.
    When celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic, we deeply cherish the revolutionary martyrs who contributed their lives for the independence, prosperity, and progress of the motherland and for the cause of the people's liberation. The lofty ideals for which they sacrificed and struggled have been realized or are being realized today. The heroic deeds of the martyrs will always be remembered in the hearts of our sons and grandsons. The merits of the martyrs will be immortal!
    When celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic, we pay the highest respect and the greatest enthusiasm to our heroic and hardworking people of all nationalities. It is our great people who broke the heavy shackles on their bodies with their own hands, overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and opened up the road of socialism. It is our great people who build a lovable motherland and their own new life with their own hands. Today, the united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, including all nationalities, all strata of the people, and all democratic parties, is more consolidated and stronger than ever before. The great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country is more intimate and stronger than ever before. The enthusiasm and creativity of the people of our country in building socialism has never been so fully brought into play. Today, the more than 3,000 labor models, combat heroes, and advanced workers from all regions, nationalities, and industries across the country who are participating in the National Day observation ceremony in Tiananmen Square are outstanding representatives on all fronts of socialist construction. They represent the unprecedented unity of all nationalities in our country, represent the brilliant achievements of all nationalities in our country, and represent our great era. The awakened and united people are invincible. No force, whether it is the enemy of the class or the enemy of nature, can ever stop the people of our country from striding forward!
    When celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic, our hearts are with the people of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the people of all brotherly countries, and with the people of all countries who sympathize with and support the cause of our people. The assistance of the socialist forces headed by the Soviet Union is an indispensable and important condition for the victory of the people's revolution and the achievements of construction in our country. The reason why our revolutionary victory was relatively rapid and our construction was relatively smooth is inseparable from these great aids. We cherish the unity with the Soviet people, the unity with the people of socialist countries, the unity with the working people, democratic and progressive forces, communist parties and workers' parties of all countries, and the unity with all peace-loving people in the world. Today, the Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the party and government delegations of all brotherly countries, the delegations of all brotherly parties, and friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Australia have come to participate in the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country . This symbolizes the great unity of the socialist camp, the great unity of the international communist movement, and great unity of the people of the world. The Chinese people express their warm welcome, heartfelt thanks, and high respect to our distinguished guests!
    When celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic, we feel confident that the one leading the people of our country to ride the wind and waves and forge ahead courageously is our glorious, correct, and great Party and the leader of all nationalities in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong. It is precisely because we have such helmsmen as the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong that the people of our country can smoothly overcome all the difficulties on the road to advance and move from one victory to another. For more than 30 years, our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and formulated the three general lines of the Party in different revolutionary stages, namely the general line of the democratic revolution, the general line of the socialist revolution, and the general line of socialist construction. The great victory of China's democratic revolution and socialist revolution fully proved the correctness of the Party's general line. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, although it has only been proposed for more than a year, the brilliant achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, as well as this year's continued Leap Forward, have also fully proved that this general line is completely correct. It is precisely because of the correct general line that the unity of the people of our country has been strengthened day by day, and the unity of the people of our country with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity with the people of all countries in the world have been consolidated and developed day by day. It is by relying on this great unity that the people of our country have been able to capture the enemy's positions one after another, so that the revolution can continue to the end, and leap forward again and again in socialist construction. The correct line of the Party represented by Comrade Mao Zedong has encountered opposition from right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning opportunism within the Party more than once in various revolutionary stages, but victory has always belonged to the correct side represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's banner is a banner of unity and a banner of victory. The people of our country are deeply proud of having the Party Central Committee, which is headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, a long-tested and strong Marxist-Leninist party. The victory of the Chinese people on the revolutionary front and the construction front is the victory of our Party's general line and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.
    When we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic, the domestic and international situation is very favorable for the socialist cause of the people of our country. Internationally, the strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is being further enhanced, the movement of the people of all countries to strive for national independence, democratic freedom, and world peace is being further developed, and the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind. Comrade Khrushchev's tremendous achievements in visiting the United States and the victory of the Soviet cosmic rocket launched to the moon are powerful proofs that have recently occurred. Domestically, the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has become the practical action of hundreds of millions of people, and a magnificent mass movement climax of anti-rightist, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy is in full swing. We are fully confident that this year's national economic plan will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, and the great leap forward goal of completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year will definitely be achieved.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country have achieved great achievements in the past ten years that are unprecedented in the history of our country. Of course, the achievements already made are still a considerable distance away from the magnificent goal of the people of our country—to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture. We also know that various difficulties will still occur on our road to continue to move forward. However, the heroic and hardworking Chinese people will never be intimidated by any difficulties. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed the task of completing the Second Five-Year Plan within this year, and at the same time called on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. Let us unite as one and strive to realize this great call!
    "Catch up with Britain in ten years" is certainly not an easy task, but it is entirely possible. Ten years ago, our country's industrial level was almost 100 years behind Britain. When our country's First Five-Year Plan was completed, in 1957, we had shortened this distance to about half a century. After the Great Leap Forward last year and this year, when our country's national economic plan is completed this year, this distance will be even shorter. We have already surpassed Britain in the output of coal, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, and the output of pig iron will also surpass Britain this year. Facts have proved that the high speed of industrial development in our country is beyond the reach of all capitalist countries, including Britain. Even if Britain's industrial production can completely avoid decline in ten years (which is difficult under the capitalist system, especially in the current Britain), and we can even assume that Britain can grow at its average annual rate during the "post-war prosperity" period (1951-1956) (the growth rate in these years is rare for Britain in decades), within ten years (calculated from 1958), our country's industry can also catch up with Britain and run ahead of it. Because according to the average annual speed from 1951 to 1956, the level that the output of major industrial products in Britain will reach by 1967 is: more than 28 million tons of steel, more than 220 billion degrees of electricity, more than 18 million tons of cement, 3.2 million tons of sulfuric acid, 2 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, and more than 5 million tons of paper. To reach such a level in 1967, the average annual growth rate required in our country is: 11.4% for steel, 24.2% for electricity, 6.2% for cement, 16.8% for sulfuric acid, 7.6% for nitrogen fertilizer, and 12.2% for paper. The speed, no matter which one, is lower than the average growth rate of the two years of 1958 and 1959, and except for electricity, all are lower than the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan from 1953 to 1957. Therefore, we have sufficient reason to say that in about ten years, our country will be fully able to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products, and we can even be more optimistic and say that it can be achieved in less than ten years. We have already created unprecedented miracles in the past ten years, and we will and must be able to create even greater miracles in the next ten years. We have all the conditions necessary to achieve this great goal: our socialist economy is a planned and proportionate economy that develops at a high speed and never experiences recession and crisis; we have the selfless assistance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union; we have abundant natural resources, the world's largest human resources, and a domestic market; especially important is that we have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and a general line that can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the 650 million working people—go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, therefore, we will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in ten years!
    The Soviet people are striding forward to catch up with the United States in twelve years, and the people of our country will also catch up with Britain in ten years. The people of other socialist countries will also advance rapidly. There is no doubt that this will have a decisive impact on the destiny of mankind. By that time, socialist countries will completely overwhelm imperialist countries in terms of material production, and the world situation will be fundamentally changed.
    The people of our country joyfully look back on the glorious past and look forward to the bright future with full confidence. Let us hold high the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, hold high the banner of unity and victory, and forge ahead courageously! Let us shout loudly: Long live the great unity of the Chinese people! Long live the great unity of the world's people! Long live the People's Republic of China!

    为第二个十年的更伟大的胜利而奋斗
    今天是伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年的日子。我国各民族人民和我们在全世界的一切友人都欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个有伟大历史意义的光辉节日。
    十年前的今天，我国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志向全世界庄严地宣告了中华人民共和国的诞生。从此，中国进入了历史的新时期。十年，这在人类历史上只不过是短暂的瞬间，而在我们的新生的人民共和国，却发生了翻天复地的伟大的变革。这是六亿五千万人民在中国共产党和人民领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设战线上取得了辉煌成就的十年，是马克思列宁主义在中国取得了伟大胜利的十年。
    中华人民共和国的成立，结束了帝国主义和国民党反动派在中国的黑暗统治，开创了我国人民掌握自己的命运的新纪元，冲破了帝国主义在东方的战线，大大增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。从这个时候起，中国进入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期。
    在建国以后的头三年（1950—1952年）中，我们继续彻底完成民主革命的历史任务，解放了大陆的全部领土，彻底肃清了残匪，在全国范围内实现了土地改革，进行了国民经济的恢复工作，与此同时也开始了伟大的社会主义革命。在1953—1957年第一个五年计划时期，我们一方面完成了对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并且在1957年进行了整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，另一方面进行了大规模的社会主义建设。从1958年开始，我国进入第二个五年计划时期。就在这一年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国国民经济实现了史无前例的大跃进，全国农村实现了人民公社化。1959年我国国民经济继续跃进，人民公社运动走上了巩固的健全发展的道路。
    就这样，在短短的十年间，我国的社会面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。多种经济成份并存的局面已经被单一的社会主义经济代替了。社会主义革命不但已经在经济战线上取得了完全的彻底的胜利，而且在政治战线和思想战线上也取得了决定性的胜利。我国的经济建设和文化建设已经有了飞跃的发展。社会主义工业化的初步基础已经奠定了。今年国民经济计划的完成，我国工农业生产总产值将比1949年增长四点三倍，其中工业产值将增长十点七倍，农业产值将增长一点五倍。我国的钢产量将从1949年的十五万八千吨上升到今年计划数的一千二百万吨，增长七十四倍；煤产量将从三千二百多万吨上升到三亿三千五百万吨，增长九点三倍；粮食产量将从1949年的二千一百六十二亿斤上升到今年的五千五百亿斤，增长一点五倍；棉花将从八百八十九万担上升到四千六百二十万担，增长四点二倍。高等学校学生人数1958年比1949年增长了四点七倍，中等学校学生人数增长了八点五倍，初等教育多数县已经基本普及，学生人数增长了二点五倍。随着经济建设和文化建设的高涨，我国人民物质生活水平和文化生活水平已经有了很大的提高。
    经过我国人民十年来的艰苦奋斗，虽然我国还没有完全摆脱“一穷二白”的局面，但是，十年的伟大成就雄辩地表明，独立的、强大的、繁荣的、社会主义的新中国不仅已经在世界上站稳了脚跟，而且正在以资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度飞跃向前。帝国主义和一切反动派曾经对新中国进行过千百次恶毒的诅咒，他们曾经预言和指望新中国既无法恢复战争的创伤也无法进行大规模的建设，他们一直武断地说新中国一定要垮台。这一切都像肥皂泡一样地破灭了。中国人民的大革命和大跃进，不仅从根本上改变中国的面貌，而且由于这个大革命和大跃进发生在原来是半封建半殖民地的经济文化落后的国家，这就不可避免地在亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲的同旧中国相类似的许多国家中，产生深刻的越来越强烈的影响。中华人民共和国的成立是继十月社会主义革命后人类历史上最伟大的事件，它的深远的世界意义随着时间的推移而愈益明显。这就是为什么我们的人民在庆祝自己的共和国建立十周年的时候这样的欢欣鼓舞的原故。这也就是为什么全世界进步人类、一切被压迫的人民、一切爱好和平的人民，对中国人民的胜利和成就这样的兴高采烈的原故。
    在庆祝我们的人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们深深地怀念那些为了祖国的独立、富强和进步，为了人民的解放事业而贡献了自己的生命的革命先烈们。他们为之牺牲奋斗的崇高理想今天已经实现了或者正在实现中。先烈们的英雄业绩永远铭记在我们子子孙孙的心里。先烈们的功勋永垂不朽！
    在庆祝我们的人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们以最高的敬意和最大的热情来向我们的英勇勤劳的各民族人民致敬。正是我们的伟大的人民用自己的双手打碎身上的重重枷锁，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，开拓了社会主义的道路。正是我们的伟大的人民用自己的双手，建设可爱的祖国和自己的新生活。今天，我国工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、包括各民族各人民阶层各民主党派的统一战线，比任何时候都更加巩固和壮大。我国各民族人民的大团结比任何时候都更加亲密和坚强。我国人民建设社会主义的积极性和创造力，从来没有现在这样充分发挥出来。今天，在天安门前参加国庆观礼的来自全国各地区、各民族、各行业的三千多位劳动模范、战斗英雄和先进工作者，就是社会主义建设各个战线上的优秀代表。他们代表着我国各族人民的空前团结，代表着我国各族人民的辉煌成就，代表着我们的伟大时代。觉醒起来和团结起来的人民是不可战胜的。任何力量，不论是阶级的敌人或者是自然界的敌人，都绝不能阻挡我国人民阔步向前！
    在庆祝我们的人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们的心向着我们伟大的盟邦苏联人民和所有兄弟国家的人民，向着所有同情和支持我国人民事业的各国人民。以苏联为首的社会主义力量的援助，是我国人民革命胜利和建设成就的不可缺少的重要条件。我们的革命胜利之所以比较迅速，我们的建设之所以比较顺利，是同这些伟大的援助分不开的。我们十分珍视同苏联人民的团结，同社会主义各国人民的团结，同各国劳动人民、民主进步力量、共产党和工人党的团结，同世界上一切爱好和平人民的团结。今天，前来参加我国建国十周年庆祝盛典的有以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团，有各兄弟国家的党政代表团，有各兄弟党的代表团，有来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲以及澳洲的朋友们。这象征着社会主义阵营的大团结、国际共产主义运动的大团结，全世界人民的大团结。中国人民向我们的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎、衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    在庆祝我们的人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们感到信心百倍的是，领导着我国人民乘风破浪、奋勇向前的是我们的光荣、正确、伟大的党和我国各民族的领袖毛泽东同志。正是由于有中国共产党和毛泽东同志这样的舵手，我国人民才能顺利地克服了前进道路上的一切困难，从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。三十多年来，我们党和毛泽东同志创造性地使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，制定了党在不同的革命阶段中的三条总路线，即民主革命时期的总路线、社会主义革命的总路线和社会主义建设总路线。中国民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利的事实，完全证明了党的总路线的正确。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，虽然提出只有一年多，但是去年的大跃进和人民公社化以及今年的继续跃进的辉煌成就，也充分地证明了这条总路线是完全正确的。正因为有了正确的总路线，我国人民的团结才一天天地加强起来，我国人民同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、同世界各国人民的团结才一天天地巩固和发展起来。正是依靠这种伟大的团结，我国人民才能够一个又一个地攻占敌人的阵地，使革命不断地进行到底，并且在社会主义建设中跃进再跃进。以毛泽东同志为代表的党的正确路线在各个革命阶段中曾经不止一次地遇到党内右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义的反对，但是胜利最后总是属于以毛泽东同志为代表的正确方面。毛泽东的旗帜，是团结的旗帜，是胜利的旗帜。我国人民深深以有党的久经考验的坚强的以毛泽东同志为首的马克思列宁主义的党中央而感到自豪。中国人民在革命战线上和建设战线上的胜利，也就是我们党的总路线的胜利，马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    当我们庆祝我们的人民共和国成立十周年的时候，国内外形势对我国人民的社会主义事业是非常有利的。在国际方面，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和团结正在更加增强，各国人民为争取民族独立、民主自由和世界和平的运动正在更加发展，东风正在进一步压倒西风。赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国的巨大成就和苏联宇宙火箭射向月球的胜利，就是最近发生的有力证明。在国内方面，党的八届八中全会的伟大号召已经成为千百万人民群众的实际行动，一个波澜壮阔的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的群众运动高潮方兴未艾。我们完全有把握地说，今年的国民经济计划必将提前和超额完成，提前三年在今年内完成第二个五年计划的大跃进目标将一定能够实现。
    我国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，在过去十年间已经取得了我国历史上空前未有的伟大成就。当然，已取得的成就同我国人民的宏伟的目标——把我国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家——相比，毕竟还有一段不短的距离。我们也知道，在我们继续前进的道路上，还会发生各种各样的困难。但是，英勇勤劳的中国人民决不会被任何困难所吓倒。党的八届八中全会提出在今年内完成第二个五年计划的任务同时，号召全党和全国人民在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。让我们全国人民同心同德，为实现这个伟大的号召而奋斗！
    “十年赶上英国”，这当然不是轻而易举的事情，但是完全能够办得到的事情。十年前，我国的工业水平差不多落后于英国一百年。当我国第一个五年计划完成的时候，在1957年，我们就把这个距离缩短到半个世纪左右了。经过去年和今年的大跃进，到我国今年国民经济计划完成的时候，这个距离就更短了。我们已经在煤炭、棉纱、棉布的产量方面超过了英国，并且生铁的产量也将在今年超过英国。事实已经证明，我国工业发展的高速度是包括英国在内的所有资本主义国家望尘莫及的。即使英国的工业生产在十年内能够完全避免下降（这在资本主义制度下，尤其是目前的英国，是难乎其难的），而且我们甚至可以假设英国能够以它在“战后繁荣”时期（1951—1956年）的每年平均速度增长（这几年的增长速度对英国来说是几十年来罕见的），十年内（从1958年算起），我国的工业也能够赶上英国，并且跑到它的前面去。因为按照1951—1956年每年平均速度，英国主要工业产品的产量到1967年将达到的水平是：钢二千八百多万吨，电力二千二百多亿度，水泥一千八百多万吨，硫酸三百二十万吨，氮肥二百万吨，纸张五百多万吨。我国要在1967年达到这样的水平，所需要的每年平均增长速度是：钢11.4％，电力24.2％，水泥6.2％，硫酸16.8％，氮肥7.6％，纸张12.2％。这样的速度，无论那一项，都低于1958年和1959年的两年平均增长速度，而且除电力一项外，也都低于1953—1957年第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长的速度。因此，我们有充分的根据可以说，在十年左右的时间内，我国完全能够在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国，甚至还可以更乐观地说，用不着十年也能够达到这个目标。我们已经在过去的十年中创造了前无古人的奇迹，我们还要而且也一定能够在未来的十年中创造更加伟大的奇迹。我们有着为了达到这个伟大的目标所必需的一切条件：我们的社会主义经济是有计划按比例地高速度发展的永远没有衰退和危机的经济；我们有以苏联为首的社会主义各国的无私的援助；我们拥有丰富的自然资源、世界上最大的人力资源和国内市场；特别重要的是我们有以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，有一条能够充分地调动六亿五千万劳动人民的积极性和创造性的总路线——鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，因此，我们一定能够在十年内赶上英国！
    苏联人民正以豪迈的步伐要在十二年内赶上美国，我国人民也要在十年内赶上英国，其他社会主义国家人民也将向前猛进，毫无疑问，这对人类命运将发生决定性的影响。到那个时候，社会主义国家将在物质生产方面完全压倒帝国主义国家，世界形势将根本改观。
    我国人民欢欣鼓舞地回顾光辉的过去，也满怀信心地瞻望着灿烂的未来。让我们高举党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，高举团结的胜利的旗帜，奋勇前进！让我们高呼：中国人民大团结万岁！全世界人民大团结万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！
