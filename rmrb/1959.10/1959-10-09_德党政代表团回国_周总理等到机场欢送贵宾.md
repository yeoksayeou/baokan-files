Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The German Democratic Republic Party and Government Delegation led by Hermann Matern, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, left Beijing by plane this morning to return home. Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman, of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, and other party and state leaders greeted the distinguished guests at the airport.

Vice Chairman Matern delivered a farewell speech filled with friendship at Beijing Airport. He said: "Half a year ago, I had the opportunity to visit your country with the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and witnessed the great achievements of your country's socialist construction, which is fundamentally changing the face of China. I must say that China has undergone further tremendous changes in the past six months, changes that please us and anger the enemies of socialism. Because we know that every step forward that we or our friends take, any new achievement in science and technology in peaceful economic construction, as the latest Soviet cosmic rocket has once again shown, is a brick in the socialist and communist edifice we are building together.

"Therefore, we are also firmly convinced that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which are welcomed and supported by the entire Chinese people, will enable the People's Republic of China to achieve greater leaps forward.

"After spending unforgettable days, we must now bid farewell to you and return to our homeland. Our country has made a resolution on the seven-year plan and put forward the goal of ensuring the victory of socialism by 1965. You are in the east of the socialist camp, and we are in the west of the socialist camp, working hand in hand for the happiness of our two peoples and for the defense of peace."

Also present at the airport to see them off today were Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council; Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; Liu Lantao, alternate secretary of the Secretariat; Huang Yanpei and Li Weihan, vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Cheng Qian, vice chairman of the National Defense Council; Ji Pengfei and Zeng Yongquan, vice ministers of Foreign Affairs; Zhu Kezhen, president of the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association; heads of government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations; senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and representatives from all walks of life in the capital. The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dair, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries also came to the airport to see them off.

After the band played the national anthems of the German Democratic Republic and China, Vice Chairman Matern, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the honor guard of the army, navy, and air force. Young Pioneers presented flowers to all the distinguished guests.

Amidst the farewell music, Premier Zhou Enlai and others accompanied the distinguished guests all the way to the front of the plane. Vice Chairman Matern warmly shook hands with the people who came to see them off to say goodbye. At about nine o'clock, the plane took off, and Premier Zhou and other party and state leaders still stood at the airport for a long time, waving to the distinguished guests.

    德党政代表团回国
    周总理等到机场欢送贵宾
    新华社8日讯　德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团第一副主席赫尔曼·马特恩率领的德意志民主共和国党政代表团，今天上午乘飞机离开北京回国。中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来等党和国家的领导人到机场欢送贵宾。
    马特恩副主席在北京机场发表了充满友谊的书面告别讲话。他说：“半年前我就有机会和德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团一起访问了你们的国家，亲眼看到了你们国家社会主义建设的伟大成就，这一建设正在根本改变中国的面貌。我必须说，中国在这半年内有了进一步的巨大变化，这些变化使我们高兴，而使社会主义的敌人恼怒。因为我们知道，我们或者我们的朋友每前进一步，在和平的经济建设中科学和技术的任何一个新的成就，例如最新的苏联宇宙火箭所重新表明的，都是我们同心协力建设的社会主义和共产主义大厦的一块砖头。
    “因此我们也坚信，受到全体中国人民欢迎和支持的中国共产党八届八中全会的决议，将使中华人民共和国获得更大的跃进。
    “在度过了难忘的日子以后，现在我们要向你们告别回到我们的祖国。我们的国家作出了关于七年计划的决议，提出了到1965年时保证社会主义胜利的目标。你们在社会主义阵营的东方，我们在社会主义阵营的西方，为我们两国人民的幸福、为保卫和平而携手并进。”
    今天到机场送行的，还有中共中央政治局委员彭真，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅，中共中央政治局候补委员康生、书记处候补书记刘澜涛，人大常委会副委员长黄炎培、李维汉，国防委员会副主席程潜，外交部副部长姬鹏飞、曾涌泉，中国德意志民主共和国友好协会会长竺可桢，政府各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领和首都各界代表人士。德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔和各国驻华使节与外交官员，也到机场送行。
    乐队高奏德意志民主共和国和中国国歌后，马特恩副主席由周恩来总理陪同，检阅了陆海空三军仪仗队。少先队员向全体贵宾献花。
    在欢送乐曲声中，周恩来总理等送贵宾们一直到飞机前面，马特恩副主席同送行的人们一一热烈握手道别。九时许，飞机凌空起飞，周总理等党和国家的领导人仍然久久地伫立在机场上，向贵宾们挥手致意。
