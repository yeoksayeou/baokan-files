　　Wage a Great Battle in the Fourth Quarter, Break Through Weak Links, Guarantee Continuous Surge in Production
　　Launch Mass Short-Distance Transportation Campaign
　　Sichuan, Gansu, and Jiangxi Organize Teams, Deploy Vehicles and Boats to Launch a Blitz

　　(Reported by this newspaper) In order to transport the 5.7 million tons of goods to be shipped out of Sichuan Province in the fourth quarter in a timely manner, Sichuan Province is carrying out a mass movement of short-distance transportation. At present, more than 3,000 people's communes across the province have established specialized transportation teams, and more than 250,000 people have participated in the short-distance transportation teams. In addition to the professional transportation teams, a temporary assault team of 600,000 people will also be formed to participate in short-distance centralized transportation.
　　In order to strengthen short-distance transportation and adapt to the new situation of the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has been urging various places since February this year to universally organize professional transportation teams of 50 to 100 people in each people's commune. According to the different transportation situations in various communes, in addition to establishing a large number of "transportation-oriented" commune professional transportation teams, management areas and production teams have also set up "part-farming, part-transport" transportation teams and "agriculture-oriented" assault teams. The close combination of these forms enables the rational use of commune labor, ensuring both production and transportation. This new transportation force has become an important force in the national transportation network in various places. From January to September this year, the province has completed more than 40 million tons of short-distance transportation, an increase of 57% over the same period last year. Many materials that had been stockpiled in mountainous areas for a long time, such as pig iron and sulfur, have been continuously shipped out.
　　After the people's communes established transportation teams, they implemented the "five fixings" method of fixing routes, times, quantities, quality, and tools, strengthening labor management and greatly improving transportation efficiency compared with the previous temporary organization of manpower for rush transportation. For example, in Anyue County, 390,000 workdays were temporarily organized in March this year to transport grain, but only 2,030 tons were transported; while in May, after the establishment of the commune transportation team, organizational leadership was strengthened and vehicles were widely used for transportation. In only 78,000 workdays, more than 5,000 tons of grain were transported, increasing transportation efficiency by 12 times and saving 320,000 workdays.
　　In addition to strengthening the organization and management of labor, vigorously carrying out tool reforms is also an important link in improving transportation efficiency and saving labor. Jiangbei County is a mountainous area, and 70% of the districts and townships originally had no access to roads. The distribution of a large amount of materials mainly relied on manual carrying. This county, after a short-term blitz this year, built 853 kilometers of wooden tracks, 7 kilometers of iron-wood combined tracks and earthen railways, 22 kilometers of earthen winch roads, 19 kilometers of chutes, and 8 kilometers of cableways. The county has realized the track transportation of mines, factories, wharves, and market towns. According to preliminary estimates, the county can save at least 80,000 laborers this year and save more than 1.5 million yuan in transportation costs.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of transportation, grain, commerce, coal and other departments, and decided to organize 200,000 people and 100,000 non-motor vehicles to launch a mass movement of short-distance transportation, fighting for 100 days to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual transportation plan.
　　Gansu Province has been focusing on mass short-distance transportation while grasping modern transportation since the end of July. By the end of September, the people's communes in the province had established more than 1,300 professional transportation teams and more than 700 reserve teams, with more than 48,000 animal-powered vehicles and human-powered vehicles, and nearly 30,000 pack animals put into short-distance transportation. The volume of transportation increased rapidly. The volume of transportation in the first 20 days of September was more than two-thirds more than the entire month of August, and the turnover of goods also greatly improved. A large number of important materials such as coal, grain, industrial raw materials and industrial products are being transported to various destinations.
　　On this basis, the party committees at all levels are now, according to the decision of the Provincial Party Committee, universally establishing transportation headquarters, led by the party committee secretary, to strengthen specific leadership. The WuShan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and its affiliated commune party committees have adopted methods such as grasping leadership, grasping ideology, grasping business management, grasping life, and setting up pacesetters and establishing red flags, making the mass movement of short-distance transportation more vigorously developed. At present, the county has completed the annual transportation plan ahead of schedule and in excess. In addition to organizing mass transportation forces, various places have also transferred some automobiles from organs and enterprises to participate in the transportation of key materials.
　　Various places have reasonably arranged transportation routes according to the flow of goods, and vigorously promoted the advanced experience of direct transportation and subcontracting by commercial and grain departments to improve transportation efficiency. A large number of mule and horse shops, veterinary stations, vehicle repair shops, and horseshoe shops have been established along the way; 30,000 people have been put into road repair and maintenance. Various places have also universally carried out technological innovation to improve transportation efficiency. The Fanjiacun Iron Mine in Wushan, located in the deep mountains and valleys, has established a combined transportation line including automobiles, horse-drawn carts, human-powered vehicles, high-altitude cables, and chutes between the mining area and the iron smelting plant 55 miles away, which greatly improved transportation efficiency. The provincial transportation department is converting 3,000 animal-powered vehicles from two wheels to four wheels. After all the conversions are completed, the tonnage of loading can be doubled, which is equivalent to adding 200 automobiles.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. A large-scale mass movement of short-distance transportation is rapidly unfolding throughout Jiangxi Province. According to preliminary statistics, the province currently has a force of 400,000 laborers, more than 13,800 human and animal-powered vehicles, and more than 12,000 bamboo and wooden rafts engaged in this movement.
　　The fourth quarter is the most intense and busiest transportation season in Jiangxi. The province's freight volume in the fourth quarter will reach more than 14 million tons. This batch of materials must be transported over short distances and loaded and unloaded at ports and stations before it can enter the entire transportation process. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to use the agricultural slack time before the autumn harvest to mobilize and organize the manpower of the vast rural people's communes and all private transportation tools to immediately launch a vigorous mass movement of short-distance transportation to ensure the smooth completion of the entire transportation task.
　　Under the unified deployment of the Provincial Party Committee, leading cadres of party and government organizations in various parts of the province personally took charge of leading the mass movement of short-distance transportation in their respective regions. Under the leadership of Zhou Ruochang, deputy secretary of the Gannan Administrative District Party Committee, and Wang Jin, deputy director of the Administrative Office, the Gannan Administrative District adopted the methods of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, advancing by water and land, launching concentrated assaults in designated areas, and combining key points with overall planning," as well as unified leadership, unified dispatch, unified freight rates, and payment according to labor, organized 130,000 people, more than 5,000 vehicles, and more than 1,300 ships to go deep into the mountains and inland river tributaries to collect materials; in the recent ten days, they have rushed out more than 30,000 tons of grain, timber, jute, crude paper pulp, and agricultural and sideline native products. Yichun Prefecture, led by Deputy Commissioner Wu Keru, organized 70,000 laborers and a large number of various private transportation tools to participate in the short-distance transportation movement. After ten days of hard work, the 5,000 people in Fengxin County transported all 1.5 million dan of crude paper that had been stockpiled in Dongyuan Township for more than four years to transportation points 50 miles away. Jingdezhen organized an assault team of more than 5,000 people to vigorously promote vehicle-ization, carry out competitions for contracted production, transportation, and quality, and for comparing output, quality, and safety, and rushed a large amount of kiln firewood from the mountains to the kiln sides of various porcelain factories. Other prefectures such as Ji'an, Fuzhou, Jiujiang, and Shangrao have also universally launched mass movements for vigorously engaging in short-distance transportation, and have already achieved significant results.

    大战四季度  突破薄弱环节  保证生产不断高涨
    千军万马大搞短途运输
    四川甘肃江西组织队伍调集车船展开突击战
    本报讯　为了在第四季度把五百七十万吨外调物资及时运出，四川省正在开展短途运输的群众运动。目前，全省已经有三千多个人民公社建立了专业运输队，有二十五万多人参加了短途运输队伍。除专业运输队外，还将组成一支六十万人的临时突击队参加短途集运。
    为了加强短途运输，适应工农业全面大跃进的新形势，中共四川省委从今年2月份即督促各地以人民公社为单位，普遍组织五十人到一百人的专业运输队伍，根据各地公社的不同运输情况，除大批建立这种“以运为主”的公社专业运输队外，还在管理区、生产队办“亦农亦运”的运输队和“以农为主”的突击队。这几种形式密切结合，使公社劳动力得到合理使用，既搞好生产，又搞好运输。这支新的运输队伍成了各地国家交通运输网的一支重要力量。今年1至9月份，全省已完成短途运输量四千多万吨，较去年同期增长了57％。许多过去长期积压在山区的物资，如生铁、硫磺等都已源源调出。
    人民公社建立运输队后，实行了定线、定时、定量、定质、定工具等“五定”的办法，加强了劳动管理，比过去临时组织人力抢运大大提高了运输效率。如安岳县今年3月份临时组织劳动力运粮，三十九万多个劳动日，只运了两千零三十吨；而5月份建立了公社运输队后，加强了组织领导，广泛使用了车子运输，仅用了七万八千个劳动日，就外调粮五千多吨，运效提高十二倍，节约劳动日三十二万个。
    除了加强劳动力的组织、管理外，大搞工具改革，也是提高运输效率，节约劳动力的重要一环。江北县是山地，原来有70％的区、乡不通公路，大量物资集散主要靠人力肩挑。这个县今年经过一个短期突击，修建了木轨道八百五十三公里，铁木结合轨道、土铁路七公里，土绞车道二十二公里，梭槽十九公里，索道八公里，全县实现了矿山、工厂、码头、场镇运输轨道化。据初步估算，全县今年至少可以节省八万个劳动力，节约运费一百五十万元以上。
    据新华社兰州8日电　中共甘肃省委最近召集交通、粮食、商业、煤炭等部门开会，决定组织二十万人，十万辆非机动车的短途运输群众运动高潮，大战一百天，保证超额完成全年运输计划。
    甘肃省从7月底开始就在抓现代化运输的同时，大抓群众短途运输。到9月下旬，全省各人民公社已建立一千三百多个专业运输队和七百多个预备队，有四万八千多辆兽力车和人力车，近三万头驮畜投入了短途运输。运输量上升很快。9月份前二十天的运输量比8月份全月还多三分之二以上，货物周转量也有很大提高，煤炭、粮食、工业原料和工业品等大批重要物资正源源地运往各个目的地。
    在这个基础上，目前各级党委都根据省委的决定，普遍成立了运输指挥部，由党委书记挂帅，加强具体领导。中共武山县委和所属各公社党委采取了抓领导、抓思想、抓经营管理、抓生活和立标兵、树红旗等方法，使短途运输群众运动更加蓬勃开展，目前全县已提前超额完成了全年运输计划。各地除了组织群众运输力量以外，还把机关、企业的部分汽车调出参加重点物资的运输。
    各地根据货源流向合理安排了运输路线，大力推广商业、粮食部门的直线运输和分片包干等提高运输效率的先进经验。沿路建立了大批骡马店、兽医站、车辆修配厂和马掌铺；有三万人投入道路的抢修与养护工作。各地还普遍革新技术，提高运输效率。处于深山峻岭中的武山樊家寸铁矿，在矿区和五十五里外的炼铁厂之间，因地制宜地建立了包括汽车、马车、人力车、高线和溜槽等各种运输工具的联运线，使运输效率大大提高。全省运输部门正在将三千辆兽力车由两轮改为四轮，全部改装完毕后，装运吨数可以增加一倍，等于增加二百辆汽车。
    新华社南昌电　一个声势浩大的短途运输群众运动正在江西全省范围内迅速展开。据初步统计，全省目前有四十万劳动大军、一万三千八百多辆人力畜力车和一万二千多只竹木排筏投入了这一运动。
    第四季度是江西最为紧张、繁忙的运输季节，全省第四季度的货运量将达到一千四百多万吨。这批物资，大都要经过短途运输和港、站装卸，才能进入整个运输过程。因此中共江西省委决定利用秋收前的农事空隙，动员和组织广大农村人民公社的人力和一切民间运输工具，立即开展一个轰轰烈烈的短途运输群众运动，以保证整个交通运输任务的顺利完成。
    全省各地党政负责干部在省委的统一部署下，亲自挂帅来领导本地区的短途运输群众运动。赣南行政区在区党委副书记周若长、行署副主任王金的领导下，采取“土洋并举，水陆并进，分片突击，点面结合”，以及统一领导、统一调度、统一运价、按劳付酬等办法，组织了十三万人、五千多辆车子和一千三百多只船只，深入山区和内河支流集运物资；在最近的十天之内，他们已抢运出粮食、木材、黄麻、土纸浆和农副土特产品三万多吨。宜春专区由副专员吴克汝挂帅，组织了七万劳动力和大批各种民间运输工具，投入了短途运输运动。奉新县的五千人马，经过十天奋战，把东源乡积压了四年多的一百五十万担土纸，全部运到了距离五十华里的交通点。景德镇组织了五千多人的突击队，大搞车子化，开展包产、包运、包质和比产量、比质量、比安全的竞赛，把大批窑柴从山上抢运到各个瓷厂窑边。其他如吉安、抚州、九江、上饶等专区，也都普遍展开了大搞短途运输的群众运动，并且已经取得了显著效果。
