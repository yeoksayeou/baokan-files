    Statement by the Chinese Government Regarding the UN General Assembly's Discussion and Passage of the Illegal Resolution on the So-Called "Tibet Issue"
    Strongly Protesting the United States' Coercion of the United Nations to Interfere in Our Internal Affairs
    Tibet is China's Territory. Quelling the rebellion and implementing democratic reforms are entirely our internal affairs, and no country or international organization has the right to interfere. The entire Chinese people express extreme indignation at the United States' deliberate crime of intensifying international tensions; the United States' conspiracy will inevitably meet with a shameful defeat.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China Regarding the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly's Passage of the Illegal Resolution on the So-Called "Tibet Issue," October 23, 1959.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China issues the following statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's discussion and passage of the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue":

    Recently, the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly illegally discussed the so-called "Tibet issue" and passed a resolution slandering the People's Republic of China. This is another heinous act by the United States government, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and many other countries, as well as fair world opinion, to coerce the majority of countries in the United Nations to grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and deliberately intensify international tensions. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people feel extremely indignant at this and express strong protest.

    Tibet is Chinese territory. Quelling the rebellion of reactionary elements in Tibet and carrying out democratic reforms in the Tibetan region are entirely China's internal affairs, and the United States and any other country or international organization have no right to interfere. The United Nations Charter explicitly stipulates that it shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. The United Nations' discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue" is a fundamental violation of the United Nations Charter, and the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" is illegal and invalid.

    Using the pretext of respecting the basic human rights of the Tibetan people to carry out such interference is an utter irony. Everyone knows that it is the ruling class of the United States that is still cruelly massacring black people, and it is the imperialist bloc headed by the United States that is constantly undermining the human rights of the vast colonial peoples. What qualifications do they have to talk about basic human rights? As for the Tibetan region of China, it is a small number of Tibetan rebels who are trying to preserve Tibet's dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system who are attempting to permanently deprive the vast majority of the Tibetan people of their human rights. Only after the rebellion of the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet was quelled and democratic reforms were carried out did the Tibetan people obtain basic human rights and genuine freedom of religious belief. The United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" is a complete distortion of facts and fabrication of slander.

    Recently, thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the international situation has begun to ease. The United States is unwilling to accept the failure of its policy of strength and its policy of aggression, and therefore creates various pretexts to intensify the Cold War, attempting to shift the responsibility onto China and other socialist countries. Raising the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations is precisely a step by the United States to deliberately create international tensions. Everyone knows that the rebellion of a small number of upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet has long been quelled, and the democratic reforms in the Tibetan region are being carried out vigorously. It is absolutely impermissible and absolutely impossible to restore the serf owner rule in Tibet supported by imperialism and foreign interventionists. The United States' coercion of the United Nations to pass a resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" irrefutably proves to the people of the world that it is none other than the United States itself that is deliberately creating tensions and attempting to hinder the easing of the international situation.

    According to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the primary responsibility of the United Nations should be to maintain international peace and security and to contribute to the promotion of international friendship and cooperation. Unfortunately, the United Nations has repeatedly been used by the United States to serve its policies of aggression and intervention. Now, under the manipulation of the United States and its followers, the United Nations has once again acted as a tool for interfering in China's internal affairs and creating international tensions. This can only further diminish the United Nations' prestige in the eyes of the Chinese people and the people of the world. At the same time, it should be particularly pointed out that Pakistan, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, which have established or semi-established diplomatic relations with China, have taken actions that are extremely unfriendly to the People's Republic of China in the process of voting on the so-called "Tibet issue" being included on the agenda or passing a resolution. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people cannot but express deep regret over this.

    The United States' coercion of the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. For ten years, U.S. imperialism has never ceased its aggression and interference against China. However, just like the previous aggressions and interventions by the United States, this time the United States' conspiracy is bound to meet with a shameful failure. It can absolutely not affect the united advance of all ethnic groups in China, including the Tibetan people, towards the road of prosperity and happiness, nor can it hinder the struggle of the people of all countries in the world to strive for the continued easing of international tensions.

### 强烈抗议美国挟持联合国干涉我国内政

    我国政府就联大讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表声明
    强烈抗议美国挟持联合国干涉我国内政
    西藏是我国的领土。平定叛乱、实行民主改革完全是我国内政，任何国家和国际组织无权过问  全中国人民对美国蓄意加剧国际紧张局势的罪行极表愤慨；美国的阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败
    新华社23日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于联合国大会十四届会议通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明　1959年10月23日
    中华人民共和国政府就联合国大会讨论并且通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，发表声明如下：
    最近联合国大会十四届会议非法讨论了所谓“西藏问题”，并且通过了一项诬蔑中华人民共和国的决议。这是美国政府不顾苏联等许多国家和世界公正舆论的反对，又一次挟持联合国中的多数国家粗暴干涉中国内政、蓄意加剧国际紧张局势的罪恶行为。对此，中华人民共和国政府和全中国人民感到极大的愤慨，并且表示强烈的抗议。
    西藏是中国的领土。平定西藏反动分子的叛乱，和在西藏地区进行民主改革，完全是中国的内政，美国和其他任何国家或任何国际组织都无权过问。联合国宪章明文规定不得干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖的事项，联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”是根本违反联合国宪章的，联合国大会关于所谓“西藏问题”的决议是非法的、无效的。
    借口尊重西藏人民的基本人权来进行这种干涉，更是一个绝大的讽刺。谁都知道，直到现在，还在残酷虐杀黑人的是美国统治阶级，不断摧残广大殖民地人民的人权的是以美国为首的帝国主义集团。他们有什么资格来谈论基本人权？至于说到中国的西藏地区，那末，企图永远剥夺西藏绝大多数人民的人权的，正是力图保存西藏黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制度的一小撮西藏叛乱分子。只有在平定了西藏上层反动分子的叛乱并且进行了民主改革以后，西藏人民才得到了基本人权和信仰宗教的真正自由。联合国大会关于所谓“西藏问题”的决议，是不折不扣的颠倒是非和造谣诬蔑。
    最近以来，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，国际局势开始趋向和缓。美国不甘心它的实力政策和侵略政策的失败，因此制造各种借口加剧冷战，力图把责任推到中国和其他社会主义国家身上。在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”，正是美国蓄意制造国际紧张局势的一个步骤。谁都知道，西藏少数上层反动分子的叛乱早已平定，西藏地区的民主改革正在轰轰烈烈地进行，要在西藏恢复帝国主义和外国干涉主义者所支持的农奴主统治，是绝对不容许的，也是绝对办不到的。美国挟持联合国通过关于所谓“西藏问题”的决议，向全世界人民无可争辩地证明了，蓄意制造紧张局势、力图阻挠国际局势和缓的，不是旁人，正是美国自己。
    根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，联合国的首要责任应该是维护国际和平和安全，并且对促进国际友好合作作出贡献。不幸的是，联合国多次被美国利用为它的侵略和干涉政策服务。现在联合国又一次在美国及其追随者的操纵下，充当了干涉中国内政、制造国际紧张局势的工具。这只能使联合国在中国人民和世界人民心目中的威信更加下降。同时，应该特别指出，同中国已经建交或者半建交的巴基斯坦、挪威、丹麦和瑞典、英国和荷兰，在表决所谓“西藏问题”列入议程或者通过决议的过程中，采取了对中华人民共和国极不友好的行动。对此，中华人民共和国政府和中国人民不能不表示深切的遗憾。
    美国挟持联合国通过关于所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，又一次证明了美帝国主义是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。十年以来，美帝国主义从来没有停止过对中国的侵略和干涉。但是，正如同美国历次的侵略和干涉一样，这一次美国的阴谋也必然要遭到可耻的失败。它既绝对影响不了包括西藏人民在内的中国各族人民团结一致向繁荣幸福大道的前进，也阻挠不了世界各国人民争取继续和缓国际紧张局势的斗争。
