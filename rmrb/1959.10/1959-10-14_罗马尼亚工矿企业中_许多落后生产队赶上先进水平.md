Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, October 13th: The movement to help backward teams catch up with advanced ones, which is being carried out in Romanian industrial and mining enterprises, has achieved great results. Now, many backward production teams have become advanced production teams.

　　The backward production team led by Milita, a nationally renowned advanced worker from the "Nicolae Bălcescu" shoe factory, has surpassed the level of advanced production teams after a month of effort. This production team saved more than 27 square meters of leather in August, which is two square meters more than what he saved when he led the advanced production team in the past.

　　In the largest Jiu Valley coal mining area in the country, a large number of advanced workers have gone to lead backward production teams.

　　The backward production team led by Romanian Workers' Party member Cristea overproduced 25 tons of coal in two days.

　　At present, the movement to help backward teams catch up with advanced ones is being carried out in depth in various industrial and mining enterprises in Romania. Many advanced workers who lead backward production teams not only help workers improve their production techniques during working hours, but also impart technical knowledge to workers in their spare time. The technical level of many workers has greatly improved.

　　罗马尼亚工矿企业中
    许多落后生产队赶上先进水平
    据新华社布加勒斯特13日电　在罗马尼亚工矿企业中开展的帮落后赶先进的运动已取得了很大的成效，现在，许多落后生产队变成了先进生产队。
    全国闻名的“尼古拉·巴尔切斯库”制鞋厂先进工作者米利塔鲁所领导的落后生产队，经过一个月的努力已超过了先进生产队的水平。这个生产队在8月份节约了二十七平方米多的皮革，比他过去领导的先进生产队所节约的还多两平方米。
    在全国最大的纪乌煤矿区，有成批的先进工作者去领导落后生产队。
    罗马尼亚工人党党员克里斯泰亚所领导的一个落后生产队在两天当中就超计划生产了二十五吨煤。
    目前，帮落后赶先进的运动正在罗马尼亚各工矿企业部门中深入开展。许多领导落后生产队的先进工作者不但在工作时间帮助工人提高生产技术，还在业余时间向工人们传授技术知识。许多工人的技术水平已有了很大的提高。
