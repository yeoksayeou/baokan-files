　　Change and Chaos
　　Lin Wei

　　Everyone now feels that Tiananmen Square is open, comfortable, solemn, and beautiful, much better than before.

　　But this is the endpoint of a period of history. It reached this point after a certain journey. For the past ten months or so, various building materials, construction machinery, tools, and workers have been piled up and crowded here. Every passing vehicle and pedestrian felt inconvenienced and uncomfortable in one way or another. They had to breathe in some flying dust, step on some mud, the car had to bump a few times, had to detour, and so on. Some people who are content with the status quo inevitably feel: what's the point of all this! Isn't it good as it was?

　　There are always some people in the world who like to stay the same and don't like change. These are probably some people who are doing not so badly staying the same. There are also some comrades like this in the revolutionary ranks. They vaguely demand socialism and communism, but when it comes to really changing things, for example, when it comes to truly abolishing the private ownership of the means of production by the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, they start making a fuss, thinking that this is not good and that is not right. But when this private ownership is maintained for a long time, hindering the development of productive forces, they are not worried and do not make a fuss.

　　These people seem to regard revolution and change as two different things. In fact, revolution is about changing things, replacing outdated old ways with better new ways. The process of revolution is also the process of change. If nothing changes, what kind of revolution is that?

　　History walks according to its own trajectory. Of course, it will not stop and refuse to change just because some people do not want to change. In the end, history always throws the outdated old ways and its defenders, the conservatives, by the roadside and goes straight ahead. So conservatives are not that scary. But people should understand that change is inevitable, and replacing old ways with new ways is a good thing. Change is revolution. Without revolution, there can be no progress from barbarism to civilization, from pain to happiness. It can even be said that without revolution, there would be no humanity. Humans were originally similar to monkeys. Why did humans later become humans, while monkeys remain monkeys? Lu Xun once raised this question and answered: "This is because monkeys are unwilling to change—they like to walk on all fours. Perhaps there was a monkey who stood up and tried to walk on two legs, but many monkeys said: 'Our ancestors have always crawled, you are not allowed to stand!' and bit him to death. They not only refused to stand up, but also refused to speak, because they were conservative. Humans are different, they finally stood up and spoke, and as a result, they were victorious." It can be seen that the emergence of humans itself is also the result of change, the result of revolution.

　　Our era is an era of the most and fastest changes. The original rulers have become the ruled, and the original slaves have become masters. With this earth-shattering fundamental change, all old things are accelerating their pace of change, so-called "one day equals twenty years." The changes in Tiananmen Square are just a small case among countless changes. We want to build modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture on the 9.6 million square kilometers of land. We want to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution, turning poverty and weakness into prosperity and strength, and turning backwardness into advancement. Around this general direction, all corners of our country are changing non-stop, changing with each passing day. Red gullies are turning into orchards, poor mountain valleys are turning into granaries, saline-alkali land is turning into fertile fields, old disaster areas are turning into paradise, the Yellow River is turning clear, and Huaibei is turning into Jiangnan. The practical struggle to change the objective world is also changing people's subjective world, changing people themselves. Many people who only knew "laboring and eating" in the past are now focusing their attention on the whole world. They are convinced that our country can "catch up with Britain" in about ten years, and they are striving to study science and technology. Women beside the stove are now also "struggling to change the face of the motherland." Shepherds have become university professors, peasants have become researchers at the Academy of Sciences, workers have become inventors, and young students have solved problems that authoritative scholars have been unable to solve. The Great Leap Forward of hundreds of millions of people has turned a ten-thousand-mile journey into a thousand or a hundred miles, and one year of progress is equivalent to a century.

　　Even our enemies dare not openly and positively oppose this huge transformation achieved by the hard work of hundreds of millions of people, because they do not want people to see their counter-revolutionary true colors. They just subtly spread seeds of doubt by some vile means, making everyone doubt whether these changes are true. They attempt to use this to relax the people's efforts and reduce the people's confidence. However, this kind of activity will not have much effect, because people all have eyes and can see the facts for themselves.

　　The most harmful thing is that some people also praise the revolution and praise the great changes in words, but they demand that no "chaos" occur in the great changes. Wherever some chaos occurs, if there's a little trouble, they think the change is not good. Such people are actually advocating staying the same and not advocating change.

　　Revolution, changing the old ways, creating new ways, means that you can't copy, you can't imitate. Here, you need to be creative and solve the specific problems you face based on the specific situation. If it is not like this, it cannot be called a revolution. This is just like climbing an infinitely high mountain: the predecessors only climbed to a certain height, and then there is no road to go up, no trace of people. What you will encounter ahead, what will happen, is unknown. You can only take one step and look at one step, and open up new roads step by step. Because revolution is about opening up new roads, mistakes are always going to happen. In order to find so many foods that can sustain life and so many medicinal materials that can cure diseases, how many mistakes did our ancestors make, how many things that could not be eaten and poisonous things did they eat by mistake, who knows! If our ancestors were afraid of eating wrong, afraid of making trouble, and refused to taste anything, humans would never know what things could be eaten, could save lives, and would have become extinct long ago. When the workers' and peasants' armed forces began to rise up to resist the domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary armed forces, they had neither good weapons nor ready-made military experts and fighting experience, just a bunch of people. If they were not allowed to fight a defeat, if they were not allowed to make any trouble, it would be tantamount to saying don't rise up to resist, don't make revolution. This is one aspect.

　　On the other hand, revolution is a drastic action of hundreds of millions of people, not a few artists shutting themselves up to make handicrafts. The understanding of the Party's policies by hundreds of millions of people cannot be completely correct and consistent, and the new problems encountered every day are so numerous and urgent that it is impossible to submit each one to the most experienced and knowledgeable people for detailed research in advance, and can only be handled by themselves at any time. Therefore, the occurrence of such and such chaotic phenomena and troubles is absolutely inevitable. Sometimes it is a little "left", or a little right, constantly making trouble, constantly correcting, learning lessons, taking better steps than before, and taking fewer detours. This is how the revolution moves forward. There is no completely straight road that does not have any deviations. As long as the general direction is completely correct, the deviations are corrected in a timely and resolute manner, and it is not allowed to develop into a global line error, causing serious damage, then that is the best and most successful leadership. With such leadership, we will be able to reach our destination smoothly and will not lead to major failures. To demand that we never be "left" or right, never be biased, and never have any trouble, then we can only not take a step.

　　Some people say that we can carry out anti-"left" while carrying out anti-right, and carry out anti-right while carrying out anti-"left", so that we can achieve not being "left" or right. This is a fantasy. In fact, from a global perspective, in a certain period, one aspect of the problem is always the main one, and the responsibility of the leadership lies in grasping the main problem, that is, the main contradiction, and putting forward clear guidelines and policies to solve the main contradiction. If we oppose both "left" and right in the same period, it is equivalent to having no guidelines, no policies, and no leadership, and of course we cannot solve the main contradiction. We cannot advance the cause.

　　We have already made and corrected "left" deviations, and we have also made and corrected right deviations. So after a period of time, can we never make mistakes and deviations again, and never have any trouble again? Impossible. Militant materialism acknowledges objective laws and acknowledges that objective laws can be understood. Therefore, people can realize their predictions and goals step by step. However, objective laws cannot be fully understood at once. People can only understand more and more deeply in practice day by day. The road of practice never ends, and people's understanding never ends. In a certain historical segment, people do understand certain things, and this knowledge is reliable; but in terms of the infinite long journey of understanding, it can only be a small step, with relativity. Since both practice and understanding are infinite, the possibility of people's understanding making mistakes is also forever present. If we do not make mistakes on this issue, we may still make mistakes in understanding some other new things. If understanding makes a mistake, actions will follow the mistake. Therefore, it is possible for trouble to occur even ten thousand years later, and it cannot be completely avoided. Making mistakes and making trouble is a subjective phenomenon from the perspective of the person involved, and we should strive to make fewer or no mistakes; from the overall historical perspective of revolutionary development, it is an objective phenomenon, with objective inevitability, that is, inevitability.

　　It should be explained that much of the chaos that some people are particularly afraid of does not mean any mistakes in leadership, but is a normal phenomenon in the revolutionary journey. There were no mistakes in the Tiananmen Square project, but during the construction period, people always felt it was chaotic, inconvenient, and uncomfortable to pass by. This is even more unavoidable. When the revolutionary war breaks out, there is chaos and panic, sometimes you can't eat a meal a day, sometimes you march for several days and nights in a row; when the mass Great Leap Forward movement starts, men and women, old and young, some go to the mountains, some go to the plains, some go to other places to support, and they haven't reunited for many days.... Aren't these chaotic situations precisely the routine of the revolution? In order to defeat the enemy and quickly build the country well, is it possible not to experience such a little chaos? If people all live according to the old routines handed down by their ancestors, of course there will be no such chaos; but there will inevitably be another kind of chaos: we will always be bullied and unable to control our own destiny; sometimes we will be made to be separated from our wives and children, and our families will be destroyed, like during the Japanese invasion of our country. That is the chaos brought about by poverty and backwardness. It is a chaos that has no hope and no future at all. The Chinese people would rather choose revolutionary chaos, the chaos of fighting to change the "poor and blank" face. This is a kind of chaos that is full of hope and has an infinitely bright future. Only through this kind of revolutionary chaos can we achieve revolutionary governance, the governance of the people. Governance and chaos are opposing concepts, but in real life they are not mutually exclusive and completely separate. Revolutionary rules and order, that is, revolutionary governance, are always being built on the one hand, and constantly being destroyed and changed on the other hand, with new chaos occurring. This process is endless. Not allowing this kind of revolutionary chaos cannot be regarded as revolutionary governance. From this sense, governance includes chaos.

　　Of course, this does not mean that we should unconditionally praise chaos. As a routine of the revolution, chaos cannot be opposed. Where there is revolution, there is chaos. Opposing chaos is essentially opposing revolution. However, viewed as a result of lack of experience, much of the chaos that was once inevitable in the past will become avoidable things as the working experience of cadres and the masses grows and enriches. Just like a mature revolutionary team, when fighting, it will be orderly and organized. Therefore, summarizing experience and learning lessons in a timely manner is important at all times. Only in this way can we "grow in wisdom after experiencing a matter." However, even if everyone has rich experience, it is still impossible to guarantee that in the event of new and complex situations, there will absolutely be no chaotic phenomena. A revolutionary materialist must be ideologically prepared for this.

　　变和乱
　　林韦
    现在的天安门广场，谁都会觉得开阔，舒畅，庄严，美丽，比以前好得多。
    但这是一段历史的终点。它经过一定的行程才到达这一点。十来个月以来，这里堆积、拥挤着各种建筑材料、建筑机械、工具和工人。来往的车辆行人，那一个都会感到这样那样的不方便，不舒适。鼻孔里要吸点飞尘，走路要踩点泥土，车子要颠几下，要绕行，等等。一些安于现状的人不免觉得：这又何苦来！照老样子不好么？
    世界上从来总是有一部分人喜欢照老样子过，不喜欢变样子。这大概是一些照老样子也过得不坏的人。在革命队伍里面，也有一部分这样的同志。他们朦朦胧胧地要求社会主义和共产主义，但是一到真正要变样子的时候，比方说要真正取消资产阶级的和小资产阶级的生产资料私有权了，他们就吱喳乱叫起来，觉得这也不好，那也不对。而在这种私有权长久地保持着、阻碍着生产力发展的时候，他们并不着急，也不吱喳乱叫。
    这些人把革命和变样子似乎看做两回事。其实革命就是要变样子，用更好的新样子代替过了时的老样子。革命的过程也就是变的过程。什么也不变，那还算什么革命呢？
    历史是按照它自己的轨道走路的，它当然不会因为有一些人不愿意变，就该变不变，止步不前。历史最后总是把过了时的老样子和它的维护者守旧派丢在路旁，径自向前走去。所以守旧派并不那么可怕。但是人们应当懂得，变是不可免的，用新样子代替老样子是好事。变就是革命，没有革命就不能从野蛮走向文明，不能从痛苦走到幸福。甚至可以说，没有革命就没有人类。人类原来和猴子差不多，为什么后来人类成了人，猴子却老是猴子呢？鲁迅曾经提出这个问题，并且回答说：“这就因为猴子不肯变化——它爱用四只脚走路。也许曾有一个猴子站起来，试用两脚走路的罢，但许多猴子就说：‘我们的祖先一向是爬的，不许你站！’咬死了。他们不但不肯站起来，并且不肯讲话，因为它守旧。人类就不然，他终于站起，讲话，结果是他胜利了。”可见，人的产生本身也是变的结果，革命的结果。
    我们的时代，是一个变化最多也最快的时代。原来的统治者变成了被统治者，原来的奴隶变成了主人。随着这个天翻地覆的根本改变，一切旧的事物都加快脚步变化起来，所谓“一天等于二十年”。天安门广场的变化，只是无数变化中小小的一桩。我们要在九百六十万平方公里的土地上建设现代工业，现代农业，现代科学和文化。要实行技术革命，文化革命，把贫弱变成富强，把落后变成先进。围绕着这个总方向，我们国家的所有角落都在一刻不停地变，日新月异地变，红圪梁变成花果山，穷山沟变成米粮川，盐碱地变成肥田，老灾区变成乐园，黄河正在变清泉，淮北正在变淮南。改变客观世界的实践斗争，也改变着人们的主观世界，改变着人们自身。从前许多只知道“劳动一吃饭”的人，现在目光注视着全世界，他们确信我国能够在十年左右“赶上英国”，奋发起来钻研科学技术。锅台旁边的妇女，现在也要“为改变祖国面貌而斗争”。放羊的变成了大学教授，庄稼汉变成了科学院研究员，做工的变成了发明家，青年学生解决了权威学者一直解决不了的问题。几亿人民的大跃进，把万里行程变成了千里百里，一年的进步抵得上一个世纪。
    对于数亿人民奋发劳动所达到的这种巨大的变革，连我们的敌人也不敢公开正面地反对的，因为他们不愿意让人民看到他们的反革命真面目。他们只是用一些卑劣手段轻轻地散布怀疑的种子，使大家怀疑这些变革是否属实。他们企图以此松懈人民的努力，降低人民的信心。然而，这种活动是不会有很大效果的，因为人们都长着眼睛，能够自己看到事实。
    最有害的，是有些人口头上也颂扬革命，称赞伟大的变革，但他们却要求在伟大的变革中，丝毫不发生“乱”的现象。什么地方发生一些混乱，出一点乱子，他们就认为变革不得。这样的人实际上是主张照老样子过，不主张变革的。
    革命，改变老样子，创新样子，这就是说不能抄袭，不能照搬。这里需要根据具体情况，独出心裁，解决自己面对的特殊问题。如果不是这样，就不能叫做革命了。这正如同攀登一座无限高的山：前人只攀到一定的高度，再往上走就没有了路，没有了人的踪迹。前面会遇到什么东西，发生什么事情，不得而知。只有走一步看一步，一步步开辟新路。正因为革命就是开辟新路，所以走错的事总是要发生一些。人类的祖先为了找到现在那么多可以延续生命的食物，那么多可以医治疾病的药材，他们曾经发生过多少错误，错吃过多少不能吃的和有毒的东西，谁能晓得！如果我们的祖先因为害怕吃错，害怕出乱子，什么都不肯尝一口，人类就会永远不知道什么东西能吃，能活命，而且早就绝种了。工农武装开始起来反抗国内外反革命武装的时候，他们既没有好的武器，也没有现成的军事家和打仗的经验，就是一堆人。如果不允许他们打一个败仗，不允许出任何乱子，那就等于说干脆不要起来反抗，不要革命。这是一方面。
    另一方面，革命是亿万群众的剧烈行动，不是少数艺术家关起门来制作什么工艺品。亿万群众对党的政策的理解不可能完全正确和一致，而每天遇到的新问题又那么繁多而迫切，不可能每一个都事先提交最有经验最有理论知识的人们详细研究，而只能随时自作处理。因此，这样那样的一些混乱现象和乱子的发生就是绝对不可免的。有时“左”了一点，或者右了一点，不断地出点乱子，不断地纠正，吸取教训，一步比一步走得更好，弯路更少，革命就是这样前进的。完全笔直的不发生任何偏向的道路是没有的。只要总方向完全正确，对偏向纠正得及时，坚决，没有让它发展成全局的路线的错误，造成严重的损害，那就是最好的最成功的领导了。有了这样的领导，我们就能够顺利地达到目的地，不会招致大的失败。要求永远不“左”也不右，不偏也不倚，不出任何一点乱子，那就只能一步不走。
    有人说，我们可以在反“左”的同时进行反右，反右的同时进行反“左”，这样就可以做到不“左”不右。这是空想。事实上，从全局说来，一定时期总有一个方面的问题是主要的，领导的责任就在于抓住主要问题，即主要矛盾，提出明确的方针和政策来解决主要矛盾。如果在同一期间反“左”又反右，那就等于没有方针，没有政策，没有领导，当然也就不能解决主要矛盾。不能把事业推向前进。
    我们已经发生过和纠正过“左”的偏向，也发生过和纠正过右的偏向，那么以后过一个时期，是不是就可以永不再发生错误和偏向，永不再出任何乱子了呢？不可能。战斗的唯物主义承认客观规律，承认客观规律是可以认识的，因此人们能够一步步地实现自己的预想和目的。但是客观规律不可能一下子都被认识，人们只能在实践中一天天地认识得更多更深。实践的道路永远没有止境，人的认识也永远没有止境。在某一历史段落上，人们确实认识了某些东西，这知识是可靠的；但对认识的无限长途说来，它只能是一小步，具有相对性。既然实践和认识都是无穷的，人们的认识发生错误的可能性也就是永远存在的。在这一问题上不会犯错误了，在另外一些新事物的认识上仍然有可能犯错误。认识发生错误，行动就会跟着错误。所以，出乱子的事情到一万年以后也还是有可能发生，不能完全避免。犯错误出乱子从当事人说来是主观的现象，应当争取少犯不犯；从革命发展的历史总体说来则是客观的现象，有客观的必然性，即不可避免性。
    应当说明，某些人所特别害怕的乱，其中有许多并不是意味着领导上的什么错误，而是革命途程中的正常现象。天安门广场的工程中并没有什么错误，但在修建时期那几个月人们总是觉得它乱，通过时不方便，不舒适。这更是无法避免的。革命战争起来了，兵慌马乱，有时候一天吃不到一顿饭，有时候连续几天几夜行军；群众大跃进运动起来了，一家男女老少有的上了山，有的下了川，有的到外地支援，好些天没有团聚……。这些乱，难道不正是革命的常规么？为了战胜敌人，为了迅速把国家建设好，难道能够不经历这样的一点乱么？如果人们都只是按照祖先们流传下来的老规程生活，当然没有这样的乱了；但是必然会有另外一种乱：我们将永远受人欺侮，不能掌握自己的命运；有时候要被弄得妻离子散，家破人亡，像日本侵略我国时期那样。那是贫穷落后所招来的乱。是一种完全没有希望、没有前途的乱。我国人民宁愿选择革命的乱，为改变“一穷二白”面貌而奋斗的乱。这是一种充满希望的、前途无限光明的乱。只有经过这种革命的乱，才能达到革命的治、人民的治。治和乱是对立的概念，但在现实生活中并不是非此即彼，截然分开的。革命的规章制度和秩序，即革命的治，总是一方面在不断的建设，一方面又在不断的破坏，改变，发生新的乱。这过程永无止境。不允许有这种革命的乱，就不能算是革命的治。从这个意义上说，治里面就包含着乱的。
    这当然不是说我们应当无条件地颂扬乱。当做革命的常规，乱是不能反对的，有革命就有乱，反对乱实质上就是反对革命。但是，当做缺乏经验的结果来看，许多过去曾经是不可避免的乱，随着干部和群众的工作经验日益增长和丰富，将成为可以避免的东西。正像一个成熟了的革命队伍，打起仗来会秩序井然，有条不紊。所以，及时地总结经验，吸取教训，任何时候都是重要的。只有这样，才能在“经一事”之后“长一智”。不过，即使大家都有了丰富的经验，也还是不能保证在新的复杂情况发生的时候，绝对不发生任何乱的现象。一个革命的唯物主义者，对此必须有思想准备。
