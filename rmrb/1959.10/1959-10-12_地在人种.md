　　Editorial Note:

　　Land is Cultivated by People

　　"Remote fields," because they are far away and difficult to reach, and "poor land," because of poor natural conditions, have always been neglected by people. Their long-term common fate is low yield, even abandonment! The fate of these fields should be changed.

　　Through accounting, Xiaodian Commune in Shou County, Anhui Province, discovered that the entire commune has 30,000 mu of remote and poor land. As long as cultivation and management are strengthened, each mu can increase yield by at least 90 jin, and the total increase in grain is equivalent to 47% of last year's summer harvest total output. This is an increase in potential that cannot be ignored. Which commune or production team does not have its own remote and poor land (more or less)? If everyone does the math, and like Xiaodian Commune, formulates practical measures to strengthen cultivation and management, then the country can seize a large amount of grain from these lands that have always been neglected! Land is cultivated by people; more "effort" will always lead to more "harvest"!

　　地在人种
    “远田”，由于边远莫及，“薄地”，因为自然条件差，所以一向为人们所忽视。它们长期以来的共同命运是低产，甚至被荒弃！这些田地的命运应该是得到改变的时候了。
    安徽寿县小甸公社通过算账，发现全公社共有三万亩远田薄地，只要加强耕作管理，每亩至少可以增收九十斤，全部增收粮食则相当于去年夏收总产量的47％。这是一个不可被轻视的增产潜力。哪一个公社或生产队没有自己的远田薄地（或多或少罢了）？如果都来算算账，都像小甸公社那样订出切实可行的措施来加强耕作管理，那么全国就可以从这些一向被人们忽视的土地上夺取大量的粮食！地在人种，多出“一分功夫”，总会多有“一分收成”！
