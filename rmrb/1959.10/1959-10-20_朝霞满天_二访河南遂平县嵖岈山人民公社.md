　　——A Second Visit to the Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province
　　By our special correspondent Li Zhun

    New Atmosphere Under Chayashan Mountain
    It has been over a year since I left the Chayashan People's Commune. Like many people who have visited here, I have been wondering, "How is the Chayashan People's Commune now?"
    In mid-September this year, I came to Chayashan again.
    The Chayashan People's Commune established its basic organizational form as early as April 12th last year. After Chairman Mao affirmed "It is still better to establish People's Communes!", it was officially named the People's Commune.
    This commune is located in the shallow mountainous area of western Suiping County, Henan Province, a place that used to be extremely poor with "nine droughts in ten years." However, the moment the People's Commune appeared, it radiated dazzling brilliance, demonstrating its immense power.
    Henan Province encountered a major drought this year, with the south being even more severely affected. In places like Suiping County, it hadn't rained for sixty or seventy days. Yet, in the fields, clear water flowed through the crisscrossing canals, and the boundless golden rice paddies proudly swayed their heavy ears under the scorching sun. The deep green beans grew waist-high, with pods so densely packed they resembled the feathers on a rooster's neck. The sweet potato fields were also ridged and watered, with thick seedlings. On the distant mountain terraces, cotton bloomed like white snow. Further up the grazing slopes, patches of white and yellow moved like clouds - not cotton, but flocks of sheep and cattle.
    The early rice had already been harvested, and tractors were thundering through the wheat fields, plowing the soil. On the threshing grounds beside the villages, stacks of rice straw stood like city walls, shielding the villages. Shiny corn cobs, braided into long braids, hung like long dragons on tall wooden frames.
    At this moment, a convoy of large trucks loaded with grain came towards us. Comrade Guo, the County Committee Minister, pointed at the trucks and said with a smile, "In the past, whenever we encountered a slight drought, we had to transport grain here. This year, despite such a severe drought, we are able to transport grain out." He then pointed to the warehouses being built in Changhan Village and said, "This year, we have had a bumper harvest, and the warehouses are not enough. The commune alone can store several million catties of grain this year."

    Overcoming the Great Drought and Winning a Bumper Harvest
    The Chayashan People's Commune originally started with large-scale water conservancy projects and faced a severe drought this year. Last spring, during the large-scale water conservancy efforts, the people of Chayashan issued a "Hundred Days Without Rain Guarantee Bumper Harvest" challenge to the Dragon King. This year, the Dragon King came to test their strength. Well, let's see the power of our commune to turn the world upside down!
    From last year to now, the commune has repaired a total of fifty-seven large and small reservoirs, six hundred and ninety-six ponds and dams, three thousand and eighty-one wells, and seventy-nine main canals, storing a total of thirty-seven million cubic meters of water. Of the commune's one hundred and ten thousand mu of land, forty-seven thousand mu have achieved self-flowing irrigation. Every drop of sweat shed in water conservancy has been transformed into grains of rice.
    In the fight against the drought, four major battles were launched. At the peak of the drought resistance efforts, the daily labor force reached twenty-nine thousand people, irrigating fourteen thousand mu of land daily, and the entire commune's autumn seedlings were watered once every seven or eight days. Such a pace of irrigation was unimaginable during the time of advanced cooperatives.
    The great drought has led to a great harvest. This year, out of the commune's one hundred thousand mu of autumn crops, thirty-nine thousand three hundred mu have already been harvested, including five thousand three hundred and eighty-seven mu of sorghum, with an average yield of four hundred and thirty-six catties per mu, an increase of 60% compared to last year; four thousand one hundred and ninety-two mu of corn, with an average yield of five hundred and eight catties per mu, an increase of 150% compared to the average before the commune; four thousand nine hundred and sixty-six mu of millet, with an average yield of five hundred and thirty-four catties per mu, an increase of 70% compared to last year; eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-three mu of rice, with the already harvested five hundred mu of early rice averaging one thousand two hundred catties per mu.
    What is this force? This is the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune and its powerful ability to reverse the situation.

    Poor Teams Become Rich, Rich Teams Become Even Richer
    After the establishment of the People's Commune, another significant change in the commune is that poor teams have become rich, and rich teams have become even richer.
    The commune has a Yanzhuang Brigade, which was originally the Pioneer Seventh Cooperative. This agricultural cooperative was located in a poor mountain gully, with low yields, and was considered a "third-class cooperative." When merging into the commune last year, no brigade wanted to merge with it. The commune party committee was determined to help them develop production and catch up with the rich teams. The commune party committee sent a party committee member to serve as the party branch secretary, assisted in formulating a production plan, and supported them with more than thirty head of livestock, two large carts, and more than two thousand yuan in loans for developing diversified economy. In this way, the team got to work. The members proposed the slogan "Take advantage of the east wind to catch up with the advanced; resolve to get rid of poverty!" Their enthusiasm was boosted, and the production outlook quickly changed.
    This brigade has a total of one hundred and seventy-five households, seven hundred and ninety-two people, and two thousand two hundred and eighteen mu of land. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu was one hundred and seventeen catties, and the whole year was short of forty-five thousand catties of grain. One hundred and five households were short of grain, and the average income per person was only eighteen yuan and five jiao. After the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, the average grain yield per mu increased to two hundred and five catties, and they no longer lacked grain, but also sold one hundred and thirty-six thousand catties of grain to the state. In this year, diversified operations also generated an income of one thousand five hundred and twenty yuan, and the average income of the members increased to thirty-two point seven yuan. This year, the average grain yield per mu is four hundred and sixty-two catties, and the total output reached one million and twenty thousand catties, with a surplus of four hundred and twenty thousand catties for sale. The income from diversified operations throughout the year increased to nine thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine yuan, and the income of the members increased to an average of sixty-one yuan. The production and living standards of this team have caught up with the local advanced production teams.
    There is also the Changhan Brigade, with six hundred and ninety-two households and more than six thousand mu of land. Originally, it was a relatively rich team. In 1957, the total grain output of the team was one million four hundred and eighty-five thousand catties, and the average income of the members per year was thirty-two yuan. After the commune in 1958, the total grain output of the team increased to two million and eighty thousand catties, and five hundred and eighty-seven thousand catties of public grain and surplus grain were sold to the state; the commune established a dining hall, and there were no more households short of grain; the average income of the members increased to fifty-eight yuan. In 1959, this team was the rice-growing area of the commune and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output for the year can reach five million and forty thousand catties, and the average income of the members this year can reach about one hundred and ten yuan. Captain Wang Lu told me, "The supply and marketing cooperative came to our village for a walk and sold more than seven hundred yuan worth of cloth. In the past, we couldn't buy that much cloth in a year."

    All Industries Developing, Six Livestock Flourishing
    The masses affectionately call the People's Commune the "root of happiness" and the "source of happiness," and this is not without reason. Please take a look at the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Chayashan People's Commune in the past year or so!
    In terms of grain: In 1957, the total grain output was twenty-four million eight hundred and ninety thousand catties, with an average yield of two hundred and eighty-seven catties per mu; in 1958, the total grain output reached thirty-three million eight hundred thousand catties, with an average yield of four hundred and forty-eight catties per mu; this year, under the conditions of a major drought, the total output jumped to sixty-five million five hundred and seventeen thousand catties, with an average yield of seven hundred and fifty-three catties per mu. They have crossed the Huai River ahead of schedule, and are riding the wave of victory, preparing to quickly cross the Yangtze River.
    The development of industry and diversified economy is even faster. As the two lines of poetry say, "Suddenly, the east wind arrives overnight, and thousands of trees and thousands of flowers bloom in competition." After the establishment of the commune, small factories developed rapidly like "bamboo shoots after a spring rain." Now the commune has sixty-four factories, including agricultural machinery factories, paper mills, fertilizer plants, explosives factories, cement plants, medicinal material processing plants, and wineries; each production brigade has one hundred and forty-four small workshops, such as brick and tile factories, shoe factories, and sewing factories. These factories have played a great role in supporting agricultural production, liberating labor, and developing a diversified economy. Animal husbandry has also experienced rapid development. Now the commune has established eleven professional pastures, two hundred and seventy public pig farms, nineteen rabbit farms, thirteen bee farms, and forty-five professional chicken farms. According to statistics at the end of August this year, the number of livestock in the commune has increased to more than nine thousand three hundred head, an increase of more than one thousand nine hundred head compared to before the commune. The number of pigs has increased to more than thirteen thousand head, an increase of more than five thousand three hundred head compared to before the commune. The development of chickens and ducks has been even greater this year. Now the entire commune has more than one hundred and ten thousand chickens, averaging almost three chickens per person. Fish farming, which used to be a "blank spot" here, has also been greatly developed after the establishment of the commune. Now there are nine million fish being raised in the commune's fifty-seven reservoirs, with the larger ones growing to five or six catties. The income from diversified economy in the entire commune has reached one million and one hundred thousand yuan this year. Due to the rapid development of agriculture, industry, and other diversified economies, public accumulation has also increased rapidly. Last year, the commune purchased four tractors, two trailers, four harvesters, one thresher, and a planter, as well as twelve diesel engines, boiler engines, gas engines, and generators. This year, the commune is even richer, and they have the power to purchase more agricultural machinery.

    The Cradle of People's Happiness
    With the development of production, the lives of the members have greatly improved and rapidly changed. I have visited several farmers. One is called Wang Shenwei, from Wang Dingzhuang, a family of four. Apart from eating grain without paying, the three full and half laborers have a monthly salary income of seventeen yuan; the family raises nine hens, four rabbits, and one pig, with an average monthly income of nine point five yuan; including the salary portion, the annual cash income is three hundred and eighteen yuan. Because the commune implements a "cooperative medical" system, this income is mainly used to buy clothes and daily necessities. Recently, his family bought five zhang and one chi of cloth in one go.
    Talking about the public dining hall, he said that the food in the dining hall is much better than what he used to eat at home. During the wheat harvest this year, the team cadres said, "You can carry the distributed grain home and cook it yourself; if you want to eat in the collective dining hall, you can carry it to the dining hall again." Wang Shenwei's wife was immediately upset when she heard this, and she resolutely refused to cook meals separately. Now, both husband and wife go to the fields together and return home together. After returning, they can wash their faces, rest for a while, chat, and play with their children.
    I also visited a farmer named Li Zhiguo. His family has six people, including a ninety-year-old mother, a son, a daughter-in-law, a grandson, and a granddaughter. The grandson and granddaughter are studying at school, and only the son and daughter-in-law are laborers at home. His family's monthly salary income is twenty yuan and five jiao, and the monthly income from household sideline occupations such as raising chickens is fourteen yuan, with an annual net income of four hundred and fourteen yuan. Since they don't have to pay for food, this four hundred yuan is only used to buy clothes. If the food supply portion is added, the average annual income per person is one hundred and nineteen yuan, more than three times higher than his income in 1957. Old man Li Zhiguo said to me, "Now I don't feel tired when I work, and I feel more energetic as I work. This year, our beans have more than one thousand four hundred pods on one plant. Who has ever seen that before? We have already applied three layers of base fertilizer to our wheat fields this year, and with this soaking rain, you will see a bumper harvest in our hands next year! There is great hope for the future!"
    Yes, "There is great hope for the future!" Here, everything is full of hope, and everything is shining with new youthful vitality! Here, all sails are filled with wind, and all ideals have grown wings.
    The People's Commune was born in this unprecedented way, and it has grown strong in this way through storms and droughts. The people have truly become the masters of nature!

　　朝霞满天
　　——二访河南遂平县嵖岈山人民公社
　　本报特约记者　李准
    嵖岈山下新气象
    从去年离开嵖岈山人民公社，已经有一年多了。像很多在这里参观过的人们一样，“嵖岈山人民公社现在变得怎样了？”心里一直在怀念着。
    今年9月中旬，我又到嵖岈山来了。
    嵖岈山人民公社是在去年4月12日就建了它的基本组织形式，在毛主席肯定“还是办人民公社好！”以后，这里才正式叫作人民公社。
    这个公社在河南省遂平县西部，是个浅山近岭区，过去是“十年九旱”极端穷困的地方。但是人民公社一出现，她就闪射出夺目的光彩，显示出磅礴的强大威力。
    河南今年遇到了大旱灾，南部旱的更厉害。像遂平县这地方，六七十天没有下过雨，可是在田野里，纵横的渠道里淙淙流着清水，一望无边的金黄色稻子，在炎炎的赤日下，骄傲地摇摆着沉甸甸的穗子。深绿色的豆子长得齐腰深，棵上的荚子结得密的像公鸡脖子上的羽毛。红薯地也打畦浇水了，秧子厚厚的。在远远的山陂梯田上，是正绽开得像白雪一样的棉花。再往牧坡上看，一片片白色和黄色的像云朵一样移动着，那不是棉花，那是羊群和牛群。
    早稻已经收割了，拖拉机在隆隆地犁着麦田。在村子边的打谷场上，稻草垛像城墙一样，遮住了村子。耀眼闪光的玉米穗拧成的大辫子，像一条条长龙似地搭在高大的木架上。
    这时，从我们迎面来了一列载运着粮食的大卡车。县委郭部长指着大卡车笑着对我说：“以前遇上点旱灾，要往这里运粮食；今年这样大旱灾，却能往外边运粮食。”他又指着常韩村正盖的仓库说：“今年这里获得特大丰收，仓库不够用了，单是公社今年自己能储备起来的粮食，就有几百万斤。”
    战胜大旱  赢得丰收
    嵖岈山人民公社本来是从大搞水利搞起来的，今年就遇到了严重干旱的考验。去年春天大搞水利时，嵖岈山人民给龙王下“百日无雨保丰收”的战书，今年龙王来比试高低了。那么，好吧，看看我们公社翻江倒海的威力吧！
    从去年到现在，这个公社共整修了大小水库五十七个，塘坝堰六百九十六处，水井三千零八十一眼，干渠七十九条，共蓄水三千七百万方。全社十一万亩土地，有四万七千亩实现了自流灌溉化。搞水利滴下的每一滴汗水，都变成了粒粒粮食。
    在抗旱斗争中，共开展四次大的战役。在最大的抗旱高潮时，每天出动的劳力达两万九千人，每天浇地一万四千亩，七八天就把全社秋苗普灌一遍。像这样的浇地进度，在高级社时，是不可能想像的事。
    大旱却赢得了大丰收。今年全公社十万亩秋作物，已经收打三万九千三百亩，其中五千三百八十七亩高粱，平均亩产四百三十六斤，比去年增产六成；玉米四千一百九十二亩，平均亩产五百零八斤，比公社化前平均增产一倍半；谷子四千九百六十六亩，平均单产五百三十四斤，比去年增加七成；水稻八千七百八十三亩，已收打的五百亩早稻，平均每亩单产一千二百斤。
    这是什么力量呢？这是人民公社无比优越性和它的强大的回天之力。
    穷队变富　富队更富
    在人民公社化后，这个公社另一个显著变化就是穷队变富了，富队变得更富。
    这个公社有个阎庄大队，是原来的先锋第七社。这个农业社在穷山沟里，产量不高，是个“三类社”。在去年合并公社时，给它合并到哪个大队，哪个大队都不想要它。公社党委决心要帮助他们发展生产，赶上富队。公社党委派了个党委委员去作党支部书记，协助制订了生产规划，并支援了三十多头牲口、两辆大车和两千多元发展多种经济的贷款。就这样，这个队干起来了。社员们提出“乘东风，追赶先进；下决心，摆脱贫困！”的口号，干劲鼓起来，生产面貌也迅速改变。
    这个大队共一百七十五户，七百九十二人，二千二百一十八亩土地。1957年，粮食平均每亩地单产一百一十七斤，全年缺粮四万五千斤，缺粮户就有一百零五户，每人平均收入仅只十八元五角。1958年人民公社化后，粮食平均亩产提高到二百零五斤，不缺粮了，而且交售给国家粮食十三万六千斤。这一年多种经营还收入一千五百二十元，社员的平均收入提高到三十二点七元。今年平均亩产粮食四百六十二斤，总产量达到一百零二万斤，可出售余粮四十二万斤，多种经营全年收入增加到九千九百三十九元，社员的收入，平均提高到六十一元。这个队的生产和生活水平已经赶上了当地先进的生产队。
    还有个常韩大队，全队有六百九十二户，六千多亩土地，原来是个较富的队。1957年，全队粮食总产量为一百四十八万五千斤，社员每人每年平均收入为三十二元。1958年公社化后，全队粮食总产量提高为二百零八万斤，交售给国家公余粮五十八万七千斤；公社成立了食堂，缺粮户没有了；社员的平均收入提高到五十八元。1959年，这个队是公社的水稻区，获得了空前的大丰收，全年粮食总产量可达五百四十万斤，社员们今年的平均收入可达到一百一十元左右。队长王禄同志告诉我说：“供销社来我们村子里转了一圈，就卖了七百多块钱的布。在过去，一年也买不了这么多布。”
    百业发展　六畜兴旺
    群众亲切地把人民公社称作“幸福根子”、“幸福源泉”，这不是没有道理。请看看嵖岈山人民公社一年多来的巨大变化吧！
    在粮食方面：1957年粮食总产量两千四百八十九万斤，平均每亩单产二百八十七斤；到了1958年，粮食总产量达到三千三百八十万斤，每亩平均单产提高到四百四十八斤；今年，在大旱情况下，总产量一跃到六千五百一十七万斤，平均每亩单产提高到七百五十三斤。提前跨过了淮河，并且正乘胜前进，准备迅速跨过长江。
    工业和多种经济的发展更加迅速。正如两句诗所说的：“忽如一夜东风至，千树万树花竞开”。公社化后，小型工厂像“雨后春笋”一样，迅速发展起来了。现在这个公社办有农业机械厂、机制造纸厂、化肥厂、炸药厂、水泥厂、药材泡制厂、酿酒厂等六十四个工厂；各生产大队办有砖瓦厂、制鞋厂、缝纫厂等小工场一百四十四个。这些工厂对支援农业生产，解放劳力和开发多种经济方面起了极大作用。畜牧业也得到了飞跃的发展，现在全社建立专业牧场十一个，公养猪场二百七十个，兔场十九个，蜂场十三个，专业养鸡场四十五个。截至今年8月底统计，全社牲畜已发展到九千三百多头，比公社化前增长一千九百多头。生猪发展到一万三千多头，比公社化前增长五千三百多头。鸡鸭在今年有更大的发展，现在全公社有十一万多只，差不多每口人平均到三只鸡。养鱼，在过去这里是个“空白点”，公社化后也得到极大的发展，现在全社五十七个水库中养着九百万尾鱼，其中大的已长到五六斤重。全公社今年多种经济收入已达一百一十万元。由于农业、工业等多种经济的迅速发展，公共积累也迅速地增加了。在去年，这个公社就购买了四台拖拉机、两部拖车、四部收割机、一部脱粒机和播种机，另外还购买了柴油机、锅驼机、煤气机、发电机等十二部。今年公社更加富裕了，他们有力量购买更多的农业机械。
    人民幸福的摇篮
    随着生产的发展，社员们的生活有着极大的提高和迅速的变化。我曾访问过几家农民。一个叫王申渭，王丁庄人，全家四口人，除了吃粮不要钱，三个整半劳力每月薪金收入就有十七元；家里喂了九个母鸡、四个兔子、一头猪，平均每月收入九点五元；连薪金部分每年收入现金三百一十八元。由于公社实行“合作医疗”制度，因此这些收入主要是买衣服穿和生活用品。最近他家一次就买了五丈一尺布。
    谈到公共食堂，他说现在食堂比他家吃的好得多。今年麦收时，队里干部说：“把分的粮食扛到家里，可以自己做着吃；如果想在集体食堂吃饭，可以再扛到食堂。”王申渭的老婆听见了，一下子火了，她表示坚决不愿意单起火做饭。现在他们夫妇两个一块上地，一块回家，回来后还能洗个脸，休息一会儿，拉个闲话，和孩子玩玩。
    我还访问了个叫李治国的农民。他家有六口人，有个九十多岁的老娘，有儿子、儿媳、孙子、孙女，孙子和孙女在学校读书，家里只有儿子儿媳三个劳力。他家每月薪金收入二十元五角，喂鸡子等家庭副业每月收入十四元，全年纯收入四百一十四元，由于吃饭不要钱，所以这四百多元只买穿的戴的。如果加上供给伙食部分，全年每人平均收入一百一十九元，比他1957年的收入提高了两倍还要多。李治国老汉对我说：“我现在干活就不知道乏，越干越有精神。今年我们的豆子，一棵上结一千四百多个荚，过去谁见过？今年麦田我们已经上了三遍底粪了，又下了这场透雨，明年你来看吧，大丰收在手里握着的！以后呀，希望大着哩！”
    是啊，“希望大着哩！”在这里一切都充满着希望，一切都闪耀着新生的青春活力！在这里所有的帆都充满着风，所有的理想都长上了翅膀。
    人民公社就是这样破天荒的产生了，也就是这样在风雨干旱中巍然壮大，人真正作了大自然的主人！
