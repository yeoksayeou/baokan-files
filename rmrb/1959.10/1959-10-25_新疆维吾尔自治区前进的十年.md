The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been liberated for ten years. In these ten years, the Party's Marxist-Leninist ethnic policy has achieved great victories in the whole country and the autonomous region, and socialist political, economic, and cultural construction has developed by leaps and bounds.

Before liberation, due to the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties, especially the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, social production in Xinjiang stagnated, the economy and culture were backward, and there was deep mutual discrimination and estrangement among the various ethnic groups. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the reactionary rule was overthrown, national oppression was eliminated, national equality was realized, and the bourgeois democratic revolution was completed. Subsequently, on this basis, the socialist revolution was realized, and a series of socialist constructions in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects were carried out. This has brought about major changes of great historical significance in the Xinjiang region, changing the social landscape, and transforming the semi-feudal society into a socialist society. The people have escaped from poverty and backwardness and are living a free and happy life. People of all ethnic groups unite, love each other, cooperate closely, learn from each other, and help each other in the common cause of building socialism. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are advancing bravely along the socialist road together with the people of the whole country.

In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct guidance of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Autonomous Region has carried out many huge revolutionary tasks, and in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, has launched one in-depth mass movement after another.

After liberation, the Autonomous Region vigorously carried out land reform, distributing more than 7.42 million mu of land and a large number of livestock, farm tools and other means of production to more than 1.9 million landless and land-poor farmers, and eliminating feudal forces. Immediately after completing the democratic reform, socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce was implemented. After the socialist high tide in 1956, the socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory. In 1958, on the basis of the cooperative and socialist rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward movement in socialist construction, the people's commune system was realized in the agricultural and pastoral areas of the whole region, and 451 people's communes were established. This series of social reforms and mass movements changed the old relations of production, liberated the productive forces, educated the people of all ethnic groups, and raised the socialist and communist consciousness and socialist construction enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups. This laid a solid foundation for the overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in the Autonomous Region.

In conjunction with the democratic reform movement and the socialist revolution movement, according to the provisions of the Common Program and the Constitution, and in accordance with the circumstances and characteristics of the areas where various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang live, we actively promoted ethnic regional autonomy, established the Autonomous Region with the Uygur ethnic group as the main body, and the regional autonomy of various ethnic minorities within the region. A total of five autonomous prefectures and six autonomous counties have been established in the region. The realization of regional autonomy has enabled the people of all ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to realize their mastery in handling the affairs of their own ethnic areas, thereby further enhancing the patriotic ideology of the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region and further promoting the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region.

Under the leadership and assistance of the Central Government and the support of various provinces and cities, the Autonomous Region has actively developed socialist economic and cultural construction, and extensively carried out production movements and cultural and technical revolution movements. We overfulfilled the Autonomous Region's first five-year plan and are smoothly carrying out the construction of the second five-year plan. After the Party Central Committee put forward the general line for socialist construction in 1958, the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, encouraged by the general line, forged ahead bravely, thus enabling the Autonomous Region's socialist construction to achieve an overall Great Leap Forward. Before liberation, there were only fourteen small factories with outdated equipment in the region. Now, 1,166 modern large factories have been built. If we add the medium and small-sized industrial enterprises run by counties and people's communes, there are more than 18,500 industrial and mining enterprises in the region. Compared with 1949, the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 3.27 times, and the proportion of the total output value of industry (including handicrafts) in the total output value of industry and agriculture increased from 17.90% to 40.76%. In agriculture, the cultivated land area has expanded to 36.17 million mu, nearly doubled compared with before liberation. The total grain output has increased by 1.9 times, and the average grain per person has increased from 447 jin in 1949 to more than 1,025 jin; cotton output has increased by more than eleven times. Livestock increased by 87% compared with 1949, and increased by 44.17% compared with 1942, the year with the most livestock before liberation. With the huge growth of industrial, agricultural and pastoral production, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commerce have all greatly developed. In particular, education, culture, and health care have developed rapidly. The number of institutions of higher learning has increased from one before liberation to eight, the number of middle schools has increased from twenty to six hundred and twenty-eight, and the number of primary schools has increased from one thousand three hundred and thirty-five to three thousand nine hundred and fifty-two. The number of students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools has increased by 3.2 times compared with before liberation, the number of medical and health units has increased by 21.6 times, and the number of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners has increased by 28.3 times. Many diseases that endanger people's lives have been eliminated or basically controlled. The huge development of socialist industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and education, culture, and health care has greatly improved the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups, and the average income of residents has increased by more than three times compared with before liberation.

In the past ten years, the achievements we have made in social reform and socialist construction are huge, and the experience we have accumulated is also rich. Reviewing the path we have traveled and summarizing the experience of the past ten years well will be of great significance to better implement the Party's general line and accelerate the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region. In these ten years of leaping development, we have the following experiences:

First, in order for ethnic minority areas to develop along the socialist and communist road, it is necessary to earnestly implement the Party's ethnic policy, strive to enhance the unity among all ethnic groups and the unity within ethnic groups, establish, consolidate, and develop socialist ethnic relations, and resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland. Experience has proved that national unity and the unity of the motherland are an important guarantee for achieving victory in all work. In the past ten years, in order to completely eliminate the ethnic estrangement left over from the old society, our Party has conducted extensive and in-depth policy education on ethnic unity among the broad masses of cadres and people, conducted education on the Marxist-Leninist view of ethnicity, and continuously checked the implementation of ethnic policies in social reform and socialist construction, and criticized and prevented bourgeois nationalist ideas. In the early days after liberation, when Han chauvinism became a tendency that hindered ethnic unity, the Party immediately made a resolution to resolutely launch a struggle against Han chauvinism and corrected this tendency. When local nationalist elements rampantly attacked the Party and local nationalism became a tendency that hindered ethnic unity and the unification of the motherland, the Party immediately launched a rectification movement centered on opposing local nationalism, criticized local nationalist elements, educated the broad masses of cadres, and consolidated the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity. Judging from the experience of several years, overcoming the various forms of bourgeois nationalism is a long-term ideological struggle. It is necessary to constantly and repeatedly conduct Marxist-Leninist education among cadres of all ethnic groups, continuously improve their socialist and communist consciousness, and prevent the growth of bourgeois nationalism. To carry out socialist construction, it is necessary to oppose bourgeois nationalism. The more in-depth the struggle against bourgeois nationalism is carried out, the more it can improve the consciousness of cadres and promote the development of socialist construction.

Implementing ethnic regional autonomy is our Party's basic policy for solving ethnic issues by applying Marxism-Leninism. After the liberation of the Autonomous Region, while carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformations, after full preparation, investigation, and repeated consultation with relevant ethnic figures, ethnic regional autonomy was promoted. Facts in recent years have proved that the ethnic regional autonomy policy is completely in line with the actual situation in Xinjiang and the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups. It is wrong to ignore the political and economic characteristics of ethnic minority areas and to ignore the positive role of the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policy. For a period of time, a small number of local nationalist elements took advantage of the opportunity of bourgeois rightists attacking the Party to oppose ethnic regional autonomy, clamoring for the establishment of an independent republic, engaging in ethnic separation, and attempting to secede from the motherland, which was extremely reactionary. This reactionary thinking has been resolutely criticized and corrected in the struggle against local nationalism.

Second, extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformations actively and steadily is the path that ethnic minorities must take to join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups and establish a prosperous and affluent socialist society. After a series of preparations, the Autonomous Region completed the land reform in 1953 and completed the three major transformations in 1956. The methods and steps taken by the Autonomous Region to solve the problems of democratic reform and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce were basically the same as those of the whole country; however, according to the instructions of the Central Government, we fully paid attention to the characteristics of Xinjiang's ethnic, religious, and work foundation aspects, and adopted prudent and steady steps. At the same time, we earnestly strengthened the Party's united front work. On the one hand, according to ethnic and religious characteristics, during the land reform, we protected some upper-level democratic figures from crossing the border; in the socialist transformation, we adopted the method of persuasion and education for capitalist industrialists and businessmen, explaining the policy of peaceful transformation, uniting all who could be united, and striving for them to take the socialist road; on the other hand, we vigorously mobilized the masses and extensively launched mass movements in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government and the experience of the whole country. Experience has proved that through mass movements, the reform work can be carried out deeply and thoroughly, the class consciousness and political consciousness of the broad masses can be improved, activists and backbone forces can be cultivated, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses can be encouraged. In the arrangement of the steps for democratic reform and socialist transformation, we adhered to the principle of being both active and prudent. In the process of carrying out the work, whenever there were conditions to speed up the pace, we actively sped up the pace; if there were no conditions to carry out the work temporarily, we would not force it and pursue speed, but vigorously create conditions and carry it out after the conditions were met. In carrying out various reform movements, we firmly grasped the central link of promoting production development, and every measure and every working step in the movement was closely combined with production, so the various movements greatly promoted the development of production.

Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of the Autonomous Region's national economy. Therefore, we have taken more cautious and steady steps in carrying out reforms in pastoral areas. During the period of recovery of the national economy after liberation and in the first few years of the first five-year plan, we implemented the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class division" and the policy of benefiting both herders and herd owners, and took various measures in production to vigorously promote the increase in animal husbandry production. From 1956 to 1958, socialist transformation was carried out on the economy of herd owners and the individual economy of herders, and the people's commune system was basically realized after the autumn of 1958. For the transformation of the economy of herd owners, we adopted a purchase policy, organized joint state-private ranches, and herd owners' livestock were converted into shares in the ranches, and dividends were distributed according to the shares. After the people's commune system was established, it was converted into fixed interest at a discounted price, and herd owners were absorbed to participate in appropriate work in the ranches; then, after an appropriate period of time, the joint state-private ranches were gradually converted into state-run ranches. The transformation of the individual economy of herders was carried out through cooperative methods, with livestock converted into shares in the cooperative, and profits distributed according to the proportion of labor and livestock, and then converted into shares in the cooperative at a discounted price; at the same time, the handling of means of production was also broader than in agricultural areas. This approach was in line with the actual situation in pastoral areas, and therefore won the support of herders of all ethnic groups, smoothly completed the transformation of animal husbandry, prevented the destruction and loss of livestock, and promoted the great development of animal husbandry production.

Third, after the realization of democratic reform and socialist transformation, the central task of the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, like the people of the whole country, is to resolutely implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, concentrate all forces, and strive to develop socialist economic and cultural construction at a high speed. In the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region, the Autonomous Region Party Committee, according to the spirit of the general line and according to the resource conditions of the Autonomous Region, proposed to build the Autonomous Region into an industrial base for steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, textiles, sugar, etc., and a cotton planting base of the motherland. In agriculture, it put forward the policy of simultaneously increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the cultivated land area, simultaneously developing grain production and developing cotton production, and simultaneously developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry. In implementing the Party's general line and the above-mentioned policies and guidelines, the masses were extensively mobilized and a large-scale mass movement was launched. The broad masses were in high spirits and full of enthusiasm. In particular, last year's Great Leap Forward movement, the Great Steel Smelting movement, and the People's Commune movement further stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses and promoted the overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. As a result, the face of the Autonomous Region has been renewed, and at the same time, a good material foundation has been laid for this year's continued leap forward and future continued leap forward. Compared with the previous year, last year's production increased by 9.5 times in iron, including 78.2% in native iron, 1.4 times in steel, including 78.6% in native steel, 221.1% in coal, and 184% in machinery manufacturing. The cultivated land was expanded by 19.4%, grain increased by 47.5%, and cotton increased by 18.9%. In 1959, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, adhering to the policy of taking steel as the key link and grain as the key link, the leap forward is continuing. Facts have proved that the Party's general line is the driving force for promoting the great development of production. Without the Party's general line, it would have been impossible to achieve last year's overall Great Leap Forward and this year's continued leap forward. To continue to achieve a leap forward in the future, we must unremittingly and diligently adhere to the Party's general line, go all out, and aim high. Facts have also proved that the policies determined by the Autonomous Region Party Committee to build Xinjiang into one of the industrial and cotton planting bases of the motherland and several parallel policies are necessary and correct. These policies, combined with last year's Great Leap Forward movement, the People's Commune movement, and the Great Steel Smelting movement, have played a huge role. Now the Autonomous Region's steel base has taken shape. In 1957, the output of iron was 17,230 tons, and the output of steel was 14,640 tons. In 1958, the output of iron was more than 180,000 tons (including more than 30,000 tons of native iron), and the output of steel was 35,649 tons (including more than 26,000 tons of native steel). This year, it is estimated that the output of iron can be 180,000 tons, and the output of steel can be 60,000 to 70,000 tons; the petroleum, coal, machinery, and textile industries have all made great progress. In agriculture, 4.75 million mu of wasteland was reclaimed in one year last year, and it is estimated that 5 million mu of wasteland can be reclaimed this year. The yield per unit area increased by 31.4% in 1958 compared with 1957, and it is estimated that it will increase by 11.9% this year compared with last year. While developing grain crops vigorously, cotton planting has also been actively developed. Compared with 1957, the planting area of grain crops increased by 12.3%, and the cotton planting area increased by 7.7%. This year, compared with last year, the planting area of grain crops increased by 10.9%, and the cotton planting area increased by 18.9%. While vigorously developing agriculture, animal husbandry has also achieved rapid growth.

Fourth, to rapidly develop the construction cause of ethnic minority areas and rapidly change the poor and backward situation of ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to have the leadership and support of the Party Central Committee and the state, the assistance of the Han people, and the assistance of inland provinces and cities. The reason why the economic and cultural undertakings of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been able to develop so rapidly is inseparable from the leadership and support of the Party Central Committee and the state, the assistance of the Han people, and the assistance of inland provinces and cities. In the past ten years, the Central Government has sent cadres from all aspects to the Autonomous Region, allocated a large amount of construction funds and materials, established a large number of industries in the Autonomous Region, and provided huge support in terms of labor and technology. From 1950 to 1958, the total investment in capital construction in the Autonomous Region reached 2.507 billion yuan, of which the state investment reached 1.844 billion yuan. In addition, the central government's loans for developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry and commerce in Xinjiang have accumulated to 13.98 billion yuan over the years. Since the liberation of Xinjiang, there has been a financial deficit every year, and the central government has provided financial subsidies of more than 470 million yuan, enabling Xinjiang to gradually reduce the deficit and achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. In addition, the support in terms of materials is also extremely huge. These assistance has greatly enhanced the construction strength of the Autonomous Region, reduced the difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources, greatly accelerated the construction speed of the Autonomous Region, and at the same time, further enhanced the unity and friendship between the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region and the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland.

Fifth, in carrying out all reforms and all construction, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party. The leadership of the Party is the great force that encourages the people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead bravely and overcome difficulties, and it is the fundamental guarantee for our victory in revolution and construction. As early as the period of Sheng Shicai's reactionary rule, the Party Central Committee sent revolutionary leading cadres such as Chen Tanqiu and Mao Zemin to spread Marxist-Leninist ideas in the Xinjiang region, sow the seeds of red, and ignite the revolutionary "spark," so that the revolutionary movement in Xinjiang was promoted by the national people's revolutionary movement, and the Three Districts Revolution that broke out in Xinjiang is an example. In the past ten years, the Party has led the people of all ethnic groups to liberate Xinjiang and carried out the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The Party has determined the policies and guidelines according to the situation and tasks of each period, closely united the masses of all ethnic groups, and guided the masses of all ethnic groups to advance. The Party attaches great importance to the unity between the people of all ethnic groups, and since the liberation of Xinjiang, it has continuously conducted theoretical education on ethnic issues of Marxism-Leninism and education on the Party's ethnic policies among cadres and masses of all ethnic groups, and has guaranteed ethnic unity politically, organizationally, and ideologically. In carrying out various reforms and socialist construction movements, the Party has actively established and developed the Party and League organizations, and has cultivated a large number of local ethnic cadres. Now, 8,982 Party branches have been established in the region, with more than 130,000 Party members, of which local ethnic Party members account for 47.3%, and 10,280 League branches have been established, with more than 220,000 League members, of which local ethnic League members account for more than 50%. More than 72,000 ethnic cadres have been trained and promoted. These cadres have played a major role in various work positions. In carrying out various movements, the Party has carried out united front work, united democratic figures from ethnic, religious, industrial and commercial, scientific and technological circles and the broad masses of intellectuals, mobilized all positive factors, and carried out ideological transformation work. Without the leadership of the Party, it would have been impossible to achieve such brilliant achievements in socialist construction.

The development of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the past ten years proves that the road we have traveled is the only correct road for all ethnic minorities in our country to seek liberation, development, and prosperity, and it is the glorious victory of the ethnic policies of our Party and Chairman Mao. At present, the task of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang is to continue to consolidate the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, consolidate the unity of the motherland, hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to leap forward; actively respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose rightism, boost morale, and comprehensively and deeply launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, launch the technological revolution and cultural revolution movement, and strive to complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan this year! Strive for the continued Great Leap Forward in the construction cause next year!

    新疆维吾尔自治区前进的十年
    新疆维吾尔自治区主席　赛福鼎
    新疆维吾尔自治区解放已经十年了。在这十年中，党的马克思列宁主义的民族政策在全国以及自治区取得了伟大胜利，社会主义的政治经济文化建设有了飞跃的发展。
    解放前，由于历代反动统治阶级的压迫剥削，特别是国民党反动派的统治，造成新疆地区社会生产停滞，经济文化落后，各民族间互相歧视隔阂很深。解放后，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，推翻了反动统治，消灭了民族压迫，实现了民族平等，完成了资产阶级民主革命；接着，在这个基础上实现了社会主义革命，进行了一系列的政治、经济、文化等方面的社会主义建设。这就使新疆地区发生了具有伟大历史意义的重大变化，社会面貌改变了，半封建的社会变为社会主义社会。人民摆脱了贫困、落后的境地，过着自由幸福的生活。各民族人民在建设社会主义的共同事业中团结友爱，亲密合作，互学互助。现在，自治区各族人民正和全国人民一起沿着社会主义道路英勇迈进。
    十年来，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在自治区党委的直接指导下，自治区进行了许多巨大的革命工作，并按不断革命的精神，开展了一个接一个的深入的群众运动。
    解放以后，自治区大力进行了土地改革，把七百四十二万多亩土地和大量的耕畜、农具等生产资料分给一百九十多万无地、少地的农民，消灭了封建势力。随即在完成民主改革的基础上，实行对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，经过1956年社会主义高潮，社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。1958年在合作化和社会主义整风运动、社会主义建设大跃进运动的基础上，全疆农业区和牧业区实现了人民公社化，建立了四百五十一个人民公社。这一系列的社会改革和群众运动，改变了旧的生产关系，解放了生产力，教育了各族人民，提高了各族人民社会主义、共产主义觉悟和社会主义建设的积极性。这就为自治区的社会主义建设全面大跃进奠定了稳固的基础。
    结合民主改革运动和社会主义革命运动，我们根据共同纲领和宪法规定，依照新疆各少数民族聚居的情况和特点，积极推行了民族区域自治，建立了以维吾尔族为主的自治区和区内各少数民族的区域自治，全区共建立了自治州五个、自治县六个。区域自治的实现，使新疆各少数民族人民实现了对本民族地区事务处理的当家作主，从而进一步提高了自治区各民族人民的爱国主义思想，进一步推动了自治区的社会主义建设。
    在中央的领导、扶助和各省、市的支援下，自治区积极地发展了社会主义的经济文化建设，广泛地开展了生产运动和文化技术革命运动。我们超额完成了自治区的第一个五年计划，并顺利地进行着第二个五年计划的建设。1958年在党中央提出社会主义建设总路线以后，自治区各族人民在总路线的鼓舞下，奋勇前进，因而使自治区的社会主义建设实现了全面大跃进。解放前，全区只有十四个设备陈旧的小型工厂，现在已建起一千一百六十六个现代化的大工厂，若加上县办和人民公社办的中、小型工业，全区已有一万八千五百多个工矿企业单位。工农业总产值，以1958年同1949年相比，增长了三点二七倍，工业（包括手工业）总产值在工农业总产值中的比重由17.90％增加到40.76％。在农业方面，耕地面积扩大到三千六百一十七万亩，比解放前增加近一倍，粮食总产量增加了一点九倍，每人平均有粮食从1949年四百四十七斤增加到一千零二十五斤以上；棉花产量增加了十一倍还多。牲畜比1949年增长了87％，比解放前牲畜最多的1942年增加44.17％。随着工农牧业生产的巨大增长，交通、运输、邮电、商业都有了巨大的发展。特别是教育文化卫生事业发展迅速。高等院校已由解放前一所增加到八所，中学由二十所增加到六百二十八所，小学由一千三百三十五所增加到三千九百五十二所，大中小学学生比解放前增加了三点二倍，医药卫生单位增加了二十一点六倍，中西医师人员增加了二十八点三倍。许多危害人民生命的疾病已被消灭或被基本控制。社会主义的工农牧业和教育文化卫生事业的巨大发展，大大改善了各族人民的物质文化生活，居民的平均收入已比解放前提高了三倍以上。
    十年来，我们在社会改革和社会主义建设事业中所取得的成就是巨大的，我们所积累的经验也是丰富的。回顾我们已走过的道路，很好地总结十年来的经验，这对更好地贯彻执行党的总路线、加速自治区的社会主义建设，将有十分重大的意义。在这飞跃发展的十年里，我们有如下的体会：
    一、少数民族地区要沿着社会主义和共产主义道路向前发展，必须认真地贯彻执行党的民族政策，努力增强各民族之间的团结和民族内部的团结，建立、巩固和发展社会主义的民族关系，坚决维护祖国的统一。经验证明：民族的团结、祖国的统一，乃是取得一切工作胜利的一项重要保证。十年来，我们党为了彻底消除旧社会遗留下来的民族隔阂，在广大干部和群众中，广泛深入地进行了民族团结的政策教育，进行了马克思列宁主义的民族观的教育，并在社会改革和社会主义建设中不断检查民族政策的执行，批判和防止资产阶级民族主义思想。解放后初期，大民族主义成为妨害民族团结的倾向时，党即作出决议，坚决开展反对大民族主义的斗争，纠正了这一倾向。当地民族主义分子猖狂向党进攻、地方民族主义成为妨害民族团结与祖国统一的倾向时，党立即开展了以反对地方民族主义为中心的整风运动，批判了地方民族主义分子，教育了广大干部，巩固了祖国的统一和民族团结。从几年的经验看，克服资产阶级的形形色色的民族主义，是一个长期的思想斗争。必须经常地反复不懈地向各族干部进行马克思列宁主义教育，不断提高其社会主义和共产主义觉悟，防止资产阶级民族主义的滋长。要进行社会主义建设，必须反对资产阶级民族主义。反对资产阶级民族主义的斗争进行得愈深入，愈能提高干部的觉悟，促进社会主义建设事业的发展。
    实行民族区域自治，是我们党运用马克思列宁主义解决民族问题的基本政策。自治区解放后，在进行民主改革和社会主义改造的同时，在经过充分准备、调查研究和同有关民族人士反复协商后，推行了民族区域自治。几年来事实证明，民族区域自治政策是完全符合新疆的实际情况和各族人民的愿望的。忽视民族地区政治经济的特点，忽视党的民族区域自治政策的积极作用是不对的。有一个时期，少数地方民族主义分子利用资产阶级右派分子向党进攻的时机，反对民族区域自治，叫嚣搞独立共和国，搞民族分离，企图脱离祖国，这是极其反动的。对这种反动的思想已在反对地方民族主义斗争中进行了坚决批判和纠正。
    二、广泛、深入地发动群众，依靠群众，积极而稳步地进行民主改革和社会主义改造，这是少数民族跻于先进民族的行列，建立繁荣、富裕的社会主义社会所必须经过的道路。自治区在经过一系列准备工作之后，在1953年完成了土地改革，在1956年完成了三大改造。自治区在解决民主改革和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题时所采取的方法、步骤和全国大体上是一致的；但是，我们依据中央的指示，充分注意了新疆地区的民族、宗教以及工作基础等方面的特点，采取了慎重稳进的步骤。同时，认真加强了党的统一战线工作。一方面，我们根据民族宗教等特点，在土地改革中，保护了一些上层民主人士过关；在社会主义改造中，对资本主义工商业者采取说服教育的方法，讲明和平改造政策，团结一切可以团结的人，争取他们走社会主义道路；另方面，我们根据中央指示和全国经验大力发动群众，广泛展开群众运动。经验证明：通过群众运动，可以使改革工作搞深搞透，可以提高广大群众的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，培养积极分子和骨干力量，鼓舞广大群众的劳动积极性。在进行民主改革和社会主义改造的步骤安排上，我们坚持既要积极，又要稳妥的方针。在工作进行中，凡是有条件加快速度的就积极加快速度；暂时没有条件进行的，就不勉强进行，不勉强追求速度，而大力创造条件，待条件具备后再进行。在开展各项改革运动中，我们紧紧抓住了促进生产发展这个中心环节，运动中的每一措施，每一工作步骤，都密切地同生产结合，因此各项运动大大推动了生产的发展。
    畜牧业在自治区国民经济中占比重较大，因此，我们在牧区进行改革采取了更加慎重稳妥的步骤。在解放后国民经济恢复时期和第一个五年计划的前几年内，我们实行了“不斗不分，不划阶级”和牧工牧主两利政策，并在生产上采取各种措施，大力促进牧业的增产。在1956年到1958年间，对牧主经济和牧民个体经济实行了社会主义改造，并在1958年秋后基本上实现了人民公社化。对牧主经济的改造，我们采取了购买政策，组织公私合营牧场，牧主的牲畜折股入场，按股分红。人民公社化后转为折价定息，并吸收牧主参加场内适当的工作；然后经过适当时间，逐步地将公私合营牧场转为国营牧场。对牧民个体经济的改造，采取合作化的办法，牲畜折股入社，按劳畜比例分益，然后转为折价入社；同时在生产资料处理上也较农业区宽一些。这样作是切合牧区实际情况的，因而取得了各族牧民的拥护，顺利地完成了畜牧业的改造，防止了牲畜的破坏和损失，促进了牧业生产的大发展。
    三、在实现民主改革和社会主义改造之后，自治区各族人民和全国人民一样，中心任务是坚决地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，集中一切力量，力争高速度地发展社会主义的经济和文化建设。在自治区的社会主义建设中，自治区党委根据总路线的精神，并根据自治区的资源条件，提出了把自治区建设成为祖国的一个钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、纺织、制糖等等工业基地和植棉基地。在农业方面，提出了提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积同时并举，发展粮食生产和发展棉花生产同时并举，发展农业和发展畜牧业同时并举的方针。在贯彻执行党的总路线和上述方针政策中，广泛发动了群众，开展了声势浩大的群众运动。广大群众意气风发，干劲冲天。特别是去年大跃进运动，大炼钢铁运动和人民公社化运动，更加激发了广大群众的热情，推动了社会主义建设的全面大跃进。从而使自治区的面貌一新，同时为今年的继续跃进以及今后的继续跃进打下了良好的物质基础。去年的生产同前年比较，铁增长了九点五倍，其中洋铁增长了78.2％，钢增长了一点四倍，其中洋钢增长了78.6％，煤增长了221.1％，机械制造增长了184％，耕地扩大了19.4％，粮食增长了47.5％，棉花增长了18.9％。1959年在去年大跃进的基础上，坚持以钢为纲，以粮为纲的方针，正在继续跃进。事实证明，党的总路线是促进生产大发展的动力。没有党的总路线，要取得去年的全面大跃进和今年的继续跃进是根本不可能的。今后要继续实现跃进，必须毫不松懈地努力坚持党的总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游。事实又证明，自治区党委所确定的要将新疆建设成为祖国工业、植棉基地之一和几个并举的方针是必要和正确的。这些方针同去年大跃进运动，人民公社化运动和大炼钢铁运动结合起来，就发挥了巨大的作用。现在自治区的钢铁基地已经粗具规模。1957年产铁一万七千二百三十吨，产钢一万四千六百四十吨，1958年产铁十八万多吨（其中洋铁三万多吨），产钢三万五千六百四十九吨（其中洋钢二万六千多吨），今年预计可产铁十八万吨，产钢六万到七万吨；石油、煤炭、机械、纺织等工业均有巨大发展。在农业方面，去年一年即开荒四百七十五万亩，预计今年可开荒五百万亩，单位面积产量，1958年比1957年提高了31.4％，预计今年将比去年提高11.9％；在发展粮食作物的同时，积极发展了植棉， 1958年和1957年相比，粮食作物种植面积扩大了12.3％，植棉面积扩大了7.7％，今年比去年，粮食作物种植面积扩大了10.9％，植棉面积扩大了18.9％；在大力发展农业的同时，畜牧业也获得了迅速的增产。
    四、要迅速发展少数民族地区的建设事业，迅速改变少数民族地区贫困落后的面貌，必须有党中央和国家的领导和支援，必须有汉族人民的帮助，必须有内地省、市的协助。新疆维吾尔自治区经济文化事业所以能够得到如此迅速的发展，是与党中央和国家的领导和支援、与汉族人民的帮助、与内地省、市的协助分不开的。十年来，中央给自治区派来了各方面的工作干部，拨来了大批的建设资金和物资，在自治区兴办了大批的工业，并在劳力方面和技术方面给了巨大支援。从1950年到1958年自治区的基本建设投资共达二十五亿零七百万元，其中国家投资即达十八亿四千四百万元。另外，中央对发展新疆农牧业和工商业的贷款，历年累积达到一百三十九亿八千万元。新疆解放后，历年来财政上都有赤字，中央给予了四亿七千多万元的财政补助，使新疆逐年减少了赤字，达到收支平衡。此外，在物资方面的支援也是极其巨大的。这些援助大大增强了自治区的建设力量，减轻了人力和物力方面的困难，大大加快了自治区的建设速度，同时也更加增强了自治区各族人民与祖国大家庭中汉族以及其他兄弟民族之间的团结和友谊。
    五、在进行一切改革和一切建设中，必须依靠党的领导。党的领导是鼓舞各族人民奋勇前进战胜困难的伟大力量，是我们革命和建设取得胜利的根本保证。远在盛世才反动统治时期，党中央即派来了陈潭秋、毛泽民等革命领导干部，在新疆地区传布了马克思列宁主义的思想，撒布了红色的种子，燃起了革命的“星星之火”，从而新疆的革命运动随着全国人民革命运动得到新的发展，在新疆爆发的三区革命，就是例证。十年来，党领导各族人民解放了新疆，进行了资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命。党根据每一个时期的形势和任务确定了方针和政策，密切团结各族群众，指导各族群众前进。党十分重视各族人民之间的团结，从新疆解放开始，就不断地在各民族干部和群众中进行马克思列宁主义的民族问题的理论教育和党的民族政策教育，从政策上、组织上和思想上保证了民族团结。党在进行各项改革和社会主义建设运动中积极建立和发展了党和团的组织，培养了大批的本地民族干部。现在全区已建立党支部八千九百八十二个，党员十三万余人，其中本地民族党员占47.3％，建立团支部一万零二百八十个，团员二十二万余人，其中本地民族团员占50％多。培养和提拔的民族干部七万二千多人。这些干部已在各个工作岗位上发挥了重大作用。在开展各项运动中，党进行了统一战线工作，团结了民族、宗教、工商、科学、技术各界民主人士和广大知识分子，调动了一切积极因素，并进行了思想改造工作。没有党的领导，要取得如此辉煌的社会主义建设成就是不可能的。
    新疆维吾尔自治区十年来的发展，证明了我们所走过的道路是我国各少数民族求得解放、发展和繁荣的唯一正确的道路，是我们党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉胜利。当前，新疆各族人民的任务就是继续巩固各族人民的团结，巩固祖国的统一，高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，继续跃进；积极响应党的八届八中全会号召，反右倾、鼓干劲，全面深入地开展增产节约运动，开展技术革命和文化革命运动，为今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗！为明年的建设事业继续大跃进而奋斗！
