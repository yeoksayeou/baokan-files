Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The national railway transportation departments are constantly reporting "all-round red" good news: the number of freight car loadings is rising steadily, the average load capacity of each freight car is constantly increasing, and the vehicle turnover speed is getting faster and faster.

Since early August, under the great call of the Party to oppose Rightism, boost morale, and practice increasing production and practicing economy, the nation's railway transport workers have been unprecedentedly enthusiastic about production. The average number of freight car loadings per ten-day period has increased by more than 800 cars compared with the past. At the same time, the vehicle load capacity has been improved, and the vehicle turnover time has been shortened. In September, the national daily freight car loadings increased from 34,690 in August to 38,248; the average load capacity of each freight car increased from 40.1 tons in August to 40.9 tons; the vehicle turnover time was also shortened from 2.58 days in August to 2.41 days, achieving an unprecedented victory in railway transportation work; an unprecedented "all-round red" grand occasion appeared in more than 20 railway bureaus across the country. Entering October, the number of freight car loadings continued to increase rapidly, averaging 39,474 from the 1st to the 16th. During the National Day holidays, railway workers not only successfully completed the busy passenger transport tasks, but also created a new record of freight car loading higher than in September. These brilliant achievements on the railway transportation front have strongly supported the continued leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production.

At present, the situation in national railway transportation work is very favorable. The vast number of workers are bravely advancing on the basis of victory, striving to complete this year's railway transportation plan ten days ahead of schedule. To this end, all railway bureaus are vigorously launching mass movements to organize Red Flag trains, trying every means to load more and transport faster. All bureaus have proposed to shorten the freight car turnover time by another 1% in October. This alone can result in nearly 400 more cars loaded each day nationwide. In order to achieve this target, all railway bureaus are vigorously organizing direct transportation trains, further strengthening the cooperation between railway departments and factories, mines, and ports, and promoting the experience of "one-dragon transportation" within railway departments and between railway departments and other departments. During this period, the Ministry of Railways and local railway bureaus have particularly strengthened unloading work to ensure that there are always cars available for loading. The Ministry of Railways organized a labor competition among eighteen major freight stations across the country, and many regions organized loading and unloading forces to unload cars at night, which greatly improved unloading efficiency. Because coal transportation accounts for a large proportion of the total freight volume, the Ministry of Railways has also instructed local railway bureaus to take various measures to first ensure the completion of coal transportation tasks. On the Shi (Jiazhuang) Tai (Yuan) railway line, four fixed train routes have been opened to specifically transport Shanxi coal out of Niangziguan. After gaining experience, this will be promoted in other coal-producing areas.

In September, more than 20 locomotive and rolling stock factories across the country produced eleven more locomotives, two hundred and eighty-seven freight cars, and thirteen passenger cars than planned, adding a new force to railway transportation. At present, the workers in each factory have also proposed to overfulfill the national plan in October and complete the annual car manufacturing tasks fifteen days ahead of schedule. A labor competition movement and a new upsurge in production to complete the annual car manufacturing plan ahead of schedule have already been launched in various locomotive and rolling stock factories.

　　多装快跑支援生产大跃进
   铁道职工力争提前十天完成运输计划
    新华社18日讯　全国铁路运输部门不断传来“满堂红”的捷报：货运装车数节节上升，每辆货车的平均载重量不断增加，车辆周转速度越来越快。
    自从8月上旬以来，全国铁路运输职工在党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大号召下，生产热情空前高涨，每旬的平均货运装车数比过去增加了八百多车，同时提高了车辆载重量，缩短了车辆周转时间。9月份，全国每天货运装车数，由8月份的三万四千六百九十车提高到三万八千二百四十八车；每辆货车平均载重量，由8月份的四十点一吨提高到四十点九吨；车辆周转时间也由8月份的二点五八天缩短到二点四一天，取得了铁路运输工作的空前大捷；全国二十多个铁路局，出现了“满堂红”的空前盛况。进入10月份，货运装车数继续迅速增加，1日到16日平均达到三万九千四百七十四车。国庆假日期间，铁路职工在出色地完成了繁忙的客运任务的同时，还创造了高于9月份的货运装车新纪录。铁路运输战线上这些辉煌的成绩，有力地支援了全国工农业生产继续跃进。
    目前，全国铁路运输工作的形势十分有利，广大职工正在胜利的基础上奋勇前进，力争提前十天完成今年的铁路运输计划。为此，各铁路局都在大搞组织红旗列车的群众运动，千方百计地多装快运。各局提出在10月份内把货车周转时间再缩短1％，仅这一项，全国每天就可以将近多装四百车。为实现这个指标，各铁路局都大力组织直达运输列车，进一步加强铁路部门和厂矿、港口的协作，推广铁路部门内部以及铁路部门和其他部门之间的“一条龙运输”的经验。这一时期，铁道部和各地铁路局特别加强了卸车工作，保证货物随时有车可装。铁道部组织全国十八个主要货运车站开展了劳动竞赛，许多地区组织装卸力量在夜间卸车，大大提高了卸车效率。因为煤炭运输在全部货运量中占有很大比重，铁道部还指示各地铁路局采取各种措施，首先保证完成煤炭运输任务。在石（家庄）太（原）铁路线上，目前开辟了四列固定列车的运行线路，专门运山西煤炭出娘子关，在取得经验后，将在其他产煤地区推广。
    全国二十多个机车车辆工厂，9月份比计划多制造了十一台机车、二百八十七台货车和十三台客车，为铁路运输增加了一批生力军。目前各厂职工又提出，要在10月份内超额完成国家计划，提前十五天完成全年的造车任务。一个为提前完成全年造车计划的劳动竞赛运动和生产新高潮，已经在各机车车辆工厂掀起来了。
