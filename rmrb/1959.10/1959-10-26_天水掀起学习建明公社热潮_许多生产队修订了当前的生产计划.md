    Tianshui is swept by a surge of enthusiasm for learning from Jianming Commune
    Many production teams revise current production plans
    (By our own dispatch) Following the example of Jianming Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, where Wang Guofan resides, local cadres and the broad masses in Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu Province, are determined to improve the current production.

    According to statistics from the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee regarding all 107 people's communes in the prefecture, over 44,000 cadres and 780,000 commune members have studied the experience of Jianming Commune in developing production. They have also compared and discussed these experiences in light of the specific conditions of their own units. Everyone expressed admiration and respect for the transformation of Jianming Commune from a "poor stick" cooperative with "three donkey legs" to its current state, equipped with tractors and water pumps. In the course of study, many production teams are unwilling to lag behind and have respectively proposed plans to catch up with Jianming Commune within three or five years. According to incomplete statistics, over 1,500 production teams have revised their current production plans. Kangpo Production Team in Qin’an County raised its planned per-unit area grain yield for this year from 180 jin to 190 jin; sideline income from 16,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan; pigs from six to one hundred; and sheep from eighty to two hundred. The Party branch secretary of Yangwan Production Brigade, Maijishan Commune, Tianshui City, said: “Wang Guofan is a Party member, and so am I; if he can run a commune well, so can I.”

    The CPC Gansu Provincial Committee believes that the movement to learn from Jianming Commune in the rural areas of Tianshui Prefecture is proceeding very well. It has requested that all localities closely integrate this movement with the current campaign to increase production and practice economy, deeply publicize and study the production experience of Jianming Commune among the broad masses of cadres and people, arouse greater enthusiasm, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year.

    天水掀起学习建明公社热潮
    许多生产队修订了当前的生产计划
    本报讯　甘肃省天水专区基层干部和广大群众，学习了王国藩所在的河北省遵化县建明公社办社经验后，决心搞好当前生产。
    据中共天水地委对全专区一百零七个人民公社的统计，已经有四万四千多名干部和七十八万名社员学习了建明公社发展生产的经验，并且结合了自己单位的情况进行了对比和讨论。大家对建明公社由“三条驴腿”的“穷棒子”社发展为现在有拖拉机、抽水机的建明公社，一致表示羡慕和敬佩。在学习中，许多生产队都不甘落后，分别提出了争取在三年、五年内赶上建明公社的计划。据不完全统计，有一千五百多个生产队修订了当前的生产计划。秦安县康坡生产队把今年粮食单位面积产量由原订的一百八十斤提高到一百九十斤；副业收入由一万六千元提高到二万元；猪由六头发展到一百头；羊由八十只发展到二百只。天水市麦积山公社杨湾生产大队党总支书记说：“王国藩是党员，我也是党员；他能办好社，我也要办好社。”
    中共甘肃省委认为天水专区农村学习建明公社的运动进行得很好，要求各地都紧密结合当前的增产节约运动，在广大干部和群众中深入宣传和学习建明公社的生产经验，鼓起更大干劲，争取今年全面大丰收。
