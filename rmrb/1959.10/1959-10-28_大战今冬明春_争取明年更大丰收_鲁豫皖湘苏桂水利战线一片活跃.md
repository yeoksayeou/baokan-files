    Wage a Great Battle This Winter and Next Spring to Strive for an Even Greater Harvest Next Year
    The Water Conservancy Fronts in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Guangxi are a Hive of Activity
    Shandong: Striving to Achieve One Mu of Irrigated Land per Person
    Xinhua News Agency reported that after the autumn planting, Shandong Province is vigorously carrying out ridge-field construction, garden-like field construction, and canal systematization. The curtain on a magnificent and large-scale water conservancy construction movement has already been raised.
    The broad masses in Shandong Province are determined to work hard this winter and next spring to expand the province's irrigated area to 80 million mu, achieving an average of one mu of irrigated high-yield farmland per person, ensuring water is available whenever needed and in whatever quantity, and also an average of 0.6 mu of general irrigated land per person. Various regions are also preparing to transform 30 million mu of waterlogged and low-lying land, basically eliminating ordinary floods and waterlogging. In mountainous areas, they will complete 35,000 square kilometers of soil and water conservation, controlling soil erosion in most hilly areas. They will establish hydropower stations to achieve a power generation capacity of 31,564 kilowatts and water-powered stations with 21,696 horsepower. After the completion of all projects, water conservancy will be basically realized. Currently, more than 3.45 million laborers in the province have been invested in water conservancy construction. As of the 12th, more than 31.45 million mu of garden-like fields and ridge-fields have been built, and 21,000 kilometers of canals (missing data from one special district) have been dug.
    Henan: Completing Engineering Tasks for September and October Ahead of Schedule
    Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 27th. Henan Province's new high tide of water conservancy construction, which combines construction and utilization, has already created brilliant achievements. During the busy "Three Autumns," a water conservancy construction army of more than 3 million people has been maintained. After several months of continuous day and night fighting, on the 11th, it completed the water conservancy project tasks for September and October 19 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 9%. Now, the water conservancy construction army is becoming more and more enthusiastic, and a larger-scale water conservancy construction movement is developing in depth.
    From September 1st to October 11th, Henan Province's water conservancy construction army completed more than 600,000 large and small canals, dug more than 560,000 wells of various types, and completed a total of 196.98 million cubic meters of earth and stone, which is 109% of the water conservancy project plan for September and October, expanding and improving the irrigation area by more than 21 million mu.
    Anhui: To Double the Water Storage Capacity Again
    Xinhua News Agency reported that while vigorously grasping the "Three Autumns" work, the people's communes in Anhui Province have drawn more than 500,000 laborers to invest in the water conservancy construction movement, opening the prelude to large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.
    Because the people's communes can allocate labor more rationally, the preparations for water conservancy construction this year are more adequate than in previous years, and the work started earlier. For example, in the Fuyang Special District, more than 33,000 farmer water conservancy technicians have been trained, the length of rivers measured and surveyed has reached more than 10,770 kilometers, more than 270,000 pieces of various advanced water control tools have been prepared, and more than 120,000 cubic meters of stone, more than 30,000 cubic meters of yellow sand, 14.6 million bricks, and 500 tons of cement have been prepared.
    The task of water conservancy construction in Anhui Province this winter and next spring is very heavy. The overall goal is to eliminate the backwardness of water conservancy construction in waterlogged and drought-prone areas. The province's water storage capacity is required to double again, reaching more than 20 billion cubic meters, to meet the water needs of 50 million mu of rice. In the Huaibei Plain, we must continue to build a river network on a large scale. In mountainous and hilly areas, the focus is on building medium and small-sized reservoirs on a large scale, while also building pond and dam projects.
    Hunan: More Than 3,400 Water Conservancy Projects Have Started
    Xinhua News Agency reported that Hunan farmers, who have successively overcome summer drought and autumn drought and achieved a bumper harvest of grain, have begun a large-scale winter farmland water conservancy movement. Now, more than 300,000 farmers in the province are fighting on water conservancy construction sites every day, and more than 3,400 water conservancy projects have started. The people's communes have exerted tremendous power in large-scale water conservancy construction, moving mountains and overturning seas with irresistible force. Since the water conservancy projects in the province started in mid-September, 134 small reservoirs that started earlier have been completed. Now, many construction sites have put forward resounding battle slogans: "Guarantee the completion of the winter water conservancy task ahead of schedule with both quality and quantity, and fire the first shot for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year."
    This year's plan for large-scale water conservancy projects in the province was formulated under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and on the ideological basis of opposing rightism and encouraging vigor. At the recent provincial water conservancy work conference, the favorable situation for large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring was also analyzed. The meeting also proposed the main measures to realize the water conservancy leap forward plan this winter and next spring, according to the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    Jiangsu: Carry Out Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy in Combination with Autumn Planting
    Our newspaper Nanjing, 27th. More than 20 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in Jiangsu Province have started, and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects such as land leveling, dike construction, and ridge construction, which are carried out in combination with autumn planting, have generally begun. 650,000 people have been invested in the water control movement. Preparations for large-scale water conservancy construction are also underway.
    The large-scale water conservancy movement in Jiangsu Province was launched after overcoming right-leaning thoughts. The enthusiasm for water conservancy construction in various regions is very high. Special districts, counties, and communes have formulated plans for large-scale water conservancy construction at all levels. The labor force mobilized for water conservancy construction after the Spring Festival may exceed the provision of 25% of the total labor force.
    In addition to the 650,000 people who have initially invested in water conservancy projects, a portion of the sheds have been set up on the construction sites of large and medium-sized projects that are about to start, and food and grass are being transported to the construction sites, and vegetables are planted on the open space next to the sheds.
    Guangxi: The Whole Region Should Build a Long-Vine Melon-Bearing Water Conservancy Network
    This newspaper reports that the winter water conservancy project in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been fully launched, and a labor army of 250,000 has rushed to the water conservancy construction site, fighting day and night. Their slogan is: Large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, strive to basically eliminate drought next year.
    The characteristic of water conservancy construction in Guangxi this winter and next spring is that, on the basis of a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects in the past, a number of large and medium-sized backbone projects will be held. After the completion of this batch of projects, it can be linked with the original more than 200,000 small-scale water conservancy projects to regulate each other, use large-scale projects to support small-scale projects, and form a long-vine melon-bearing water conservancy network. At the same time, we must build large-scale agricultural canals, consolidate the drainage and irrigation system, and establish a large number of pumping stations in order to fully exert the effectiveness of all completed projects. The autonomous region has initially planned that there will be more than 900 water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, with an irrigation area of 9.74 million mu and a water storage capacity equal to one and a half times the total amount of water conservancy projects built in previous years.
    The 37,000 people at the Baise Chengbi River Reservoir, 16,000 people at the Linyi Qingshitan Reservoir, and 25,000 people at Laibin County, who are at the forefront of the region's projects, have launched a vigorous labor competition movement. The Qingshitan Reservoir held a 10,000-person oath-taking meeting at the construction site, and immediately launched a large-scale challenge competition movement, which significantly improved work efficiency.

    大战今冬明春　争取明年更大丰收
    鲁豫皖湘苏桂水利战线一片活跃
    山东：争取实现每人一亩水浇田
    据新华社讯　山东省各地紧接在秋种中大搞畦田化、园田化、渠道系统化之后，一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的水利建设运动的序幕已经揭开。
    山东省各地广大群众，决心大干一冬一春，把全省灌溉面积扩大到八千万亩，实现平均每人一亩水浇丰产田，作到何时用水何时有，用多少有多少，另外每人平均有六分一般水浇田。各地还准备改造涝洼地三千万亩，要求基本上解除普通洪涝灾害；山区完成水土保持面积三万五千平方公里，控制大部山丘地区水土流失；建立水电站使发电能力达到三万一千五百六十四瓩，水力站达到二万一千六百九十六马力。全部工程完成后基本上实现水利化。目前，全省已投入水利建设的劳力达三百四十五万多人，到12日的统计已搞起来的园田、畦田等有三千一百四十五万多亩，渠道（缺一个专区）二万一千公里。
    河南：提前完成九、十月工程任务
    本报郑州27日电　河南省边建设边利用的水利建设新高潮，已经创造出辉煌的成就。在大忙的“三秋”里，始终保持着三百多万人的水利建设大军，经过几个月持续的日夜奋战，在11日提前十九天，超额9％完成了9、10两个月的水利工程任务；现在，水利建设大军干劲越干越大，更大规模的水利建设运动正在向纵深发展。
    河南省的水利建设运动的大军，从9月1日到10月11日，共完成大小渠道六十多万条，打各种井五十六万多眼，共做土、石方一亿九千六百九十八万立方米，为9、10两个月水利工程计划的109％，共扩大和改善灌溉面积二千一百多万亩。
    安徽：要蓄水量再增加一倍
    据新华社讯　安徽省各地人民公社在大抓“三秋”工作的同时，已抽出五十多万劳动力投入了水利兴修运动，提早揭开了今冬明春大兴水利的序幕。
    由于人民公社能更合理地调配劳动力，因此，今年全省兴修水利的准备工作比往年做得充分，动手比往年早。如阜阳专区，已训练了农民水利技术员三万三千多人，完成测量放样的河道长度已达一万零七百七十多公里，各种先进的治水工具已准备了二十七万多件，并准备好了石料十二万多立方米、黄沙三万多立方米、砖头一千四百六十万块、水泥五百吨。
    安徽省今冬明春的水利兴修任务很大，总的奋斗目标是要消灭易涝易旱地区水利建设落后的情况，全省蓄水量要求再增加一倍，达到二百多亿立方米，满足五千万亩水稻的用水。在淮北平原，要继续大搞河网化。山区和丘陵区是以大搞中、小型水库为主，同时兴修塘坝工程。
    湖南：三千四百多处水利工程开工
    据新华社讯　今年连续战胜夏旱和秋旱、取得粮食大丰收的湖南农民，又开始了规模巨大的冬修农田水利运动。现在，全省每天有三十多万农民战斗在水利工地上，已有三千四百多处水利工程开工。人民公社在大修水利中发挥了巨大的威力，移山倒海，势如破竹。从9月中旬全省水利工程开工以来，现在已有一百三十四座动手较早的小型水库竣工。现在，许多工地都提出响亮的战斗口号：“保证如质如量地提前完成水利冬修任务，为明年农业生产更大跃进打响第一炮”。
    今年全省大修水利工程的规划，是在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，在反右倾、鼓干劲的思想基础上制订的。在最近召开的全省水利工作会议上，还分析了今冬明春大修水利的有利形势。会议还根据中共湖南省委的指示精神，提出实现今冬明春水利跃进规划的主要措施。
    江苏：结合秋播大修农田水利
    本报南京27日电　江苏省目前大、中型水利工程已有二十多处开工，结合秋播进行的平整土地、打圩筑畦等小型农田水利工程普遍开始。投入治水运动的有六十五万人。大规模兴修水利的准备工作也正在积极进行。
    江苏省大兴水利运动是在克服了右倾思想以后掀起的。各地修水利劲头很大，专区、县、公社，已层层制订了大搞水利的计划。在春节后动员投入水利建设的劳力可以超过占全部劳力25％的规定。
    全省除了六十五万人首先投入水利工程以外，即将开工的大、中型工程，工地上已搭起了一部分工棚，调运粮草运送工地，并在工棚旁边空地上种上了蔬菜。
    广西：全区要建成长藤结瓜水利网
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区冬修水利工程已经全面动工，已有二十五万劳动大军奔赴水利工地，日夜奋战。他们的口号是：大搞水利一冬春，力争明年基本消灭旱灾。
    广西今冬明春兴修水利的特点，是在过去大量兴修小型水利的基础上，再举办一批大中型的骨干工程。这批工程完工之后，就可与原有的二十多万处小型水利联结起来，互相调剂，以大养小，形成一个长藤结瓜水利网。同时，要大修农毛渠，整理排灌系统，建立大批抽水机站，以便充分发挥所有已建工程的效用，自治区初步规划，今冬明春的水利工程有九百多项，灌溉面积九百七十四万亩，蓄水量等于历年兴修水利工程总量的一倍半。
    走在全区工程最前列的百色澄碧河水库三万七千人，临桂青狮潭水库一万六千人，来宾县二万五千人，已经开展了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛运动，青狮潭水库在工地举行了万余人的誓师大会后，立即开展了一个声势浩大的打擂台比武运动，使工效显著提高。
