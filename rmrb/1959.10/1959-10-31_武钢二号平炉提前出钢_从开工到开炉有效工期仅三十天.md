Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th October: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 giant open-hearth furnace was put into operation on the 30th. At 5:35 pm, the first batch of molten steel flowed out of the furnace amidst thunderous cheers.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 open-hearth furnace was born in the excellent situation after opposing rightism and encouraging vigorous effort. It marks a new leap forward in the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel. From the start of construction on September 22nd to the smelting of the first batch of steel, the effective construction period totaled only thirty days. The amount of metal structure installation and bricklaying for the furnace body were both greater than that of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, but the construction period for these two projects was shortened by twenty-nine days and seven days respectively compared to the No. 1 open-hearth furnace. After inspection, the quality of the project is excellent. The construction cost is also lower than the budget, with the metal structure installation cost being 4% lower than the budget and the bricklaying cost being 15% lower.

During the construction of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace, the three thousand construction workers, inspired by the Party's General Line, summarized the construction experience of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, boldly innovated construction methods, and implemented a system of fixed personnel, quantity, location, and time, launching various forms of competitions, which generally improved labor efficiency.

The construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 open-hearth furnace has received assistance from many units across the country. Mechanical manufacturing plants in Shanghai, Dalian, Taiyuan, Wuhan, and other places have rushed to manufacture furnace body equipment, cranes, slag pot cars, and so on for Wuhan Iron and Steel.

Soviet experts have made outstanding contributions to the rapid and high-quality construction of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace. Experts such as Chelyshev, Nosov, and Petrenko played a significant role in the early completion and commissioning of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 open-hearth furnace.

    武钢二号平炉提前出钢
    从开工到开炉有效工期仅三十天
    据新华社武汉30日电　武汉钢铁公司二号巨型平炉在30日投入生产。下午五时三十五分，这座平炉在雷动般的欢呼声中流出了第一炉钢水。
    武钢二号平炉是在反右倾、鼓干劲后的大好形势下诞生的。它标志着武钢建设的一个新的跃进。这座平炉从9月22日开工建设到炼出第一炉钢，有效工期总共只用了三十天。它的炉体的金属结构安装量和炉体砌砖量，都比一号平炉为多，而这两项工程的建设工期却分别比一号平炉缩短二十九天和七天。经过检验，工程质量优良。建设成本也比预算为低，金属结构安装成本比预算降低4％，砌砖工程成本比预算降低15％。
    在二号平炉建设过程中，三千名建设工人在党的总路线鼓舞下，总结了一号平炉的建设经验，大胆地革新施工方法，并实行定人、定量、定位、定时的制度，展开了各种形式的竞赛，使劳动效率普遍提高。
    武钢二号平炉的建设得到全国许多单位的援助，上海、大连、太原、武汉等地的机械制造厂，都为武钢赶制炉体设备和吊车、渣罐车等。
    苏联专家们对快速优质地建设二号平炉作了卓越的贡献。捷辽申、诺索夫、彼特连柯等专家对武钢二号平炉的提前建成投入生产，都起了重大的作用。
