    Our country is filled with a scene of joy. Seeing this excellent situation, people burst forth from the depths of their hearts with praise, extolment, and love for the Party, for the Motherland, and for the people's leaders. People can't help but shout "Long Live!"—Long Live the General Line, Long Live the Great Leap Forward, Long Live the People's Communes… Long Live! The shouts of hundreds of millions of people resound throughout the country, reaching the skies!

    Long Live! This is not an ordinary sound. It expresses our revolutionary conviction, it is filled with our firm confidence, and it expresses our love and praise for the revolutionary cause. We shout "Long Live!" and stride forward towards the goal of revolution. However, what we praise is precisely what the enemy curses. Thus, our enemies feel panic and unease. The more we shout "Long Live!", the more frantically they attack, scold, and slander us. But with 600 million people united as one, the cries of "Long Live!" still thunderously shake their eardrums. The antagonistic classes have no common ground or feelings with us, no common language or voice. What the enemy hates and detests, we should love and cherish even more!

    However, within our own ranks, there are also a very few people whose cries of "Long Live!" are not loud enough, and who even mutter, "What's the use of shouting 'Long Live'? It's formalism!" "Things change, how can 'Long Live' be immortal?"

    "Long Live, Long Live, Long Live!" This is the voice of the working people from the bottom of their hearts. Feelings originate from the heart and manifest themselves externally. Without a strong love for the revolutionary cause, there would be no such loud and uplifting voice. There is rich content within the "Long Live" cry, how can it be called "formalism"!?

    For example, when we sing "Long Live the People's Heroes!" it is because the noble style and spirit of the people's heroes, whether living or dead, are immortal. People can draw great spiritual strength to overcome difficulties from their advanced deeds and thoughts at any time, and use this strength to encourage themselves to engage in revolutionary work with vigorous will. When we encounter difficulties and lack confidence, we immediately raise our heads when we think of the veteran soldiers who climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed the grasslands, and completed the 25,000-li Long March. Hasn't Liu Hulan been dead for many years? However, the living Liu Hulans are truly in the thousands. Our Party's good daughter, Xiang Xiuli, sacrificed herself to save state property, but in the process of learning from Xiang Xiuli, thousands upon thousands of Xiang Xiuli-style advanced figures have emerged among the young comrades in all parts of our motherland!

    When we cheer "Long Live the People's Leader," it is by no means because we do not believe in the principles of physiology. People cannot violate the laws of natural development, and everyone must go through the process of birth, growth, aging, and death. However, only the dead minds of bookworms would associate the principles of physiology with our shouting "Long Live!" The great role played by the people's leaders in our great era is evergreen and immortal. Although Marx and Lenin have passed away, their cause and spirit of thought are still being carried forward. We have obtained the guide to revolutionary struggle from their works, and we inherit the legacy of the revolutionary teachers, holding high the banner of communism and advancing bravely! Of course, people should respect, love, and can't help but shout "Long Live!" from the bottom of their hearts to the people's leaders who represent the truth of Marxism-Leninism, centrally embody the will of the people, and formulate and adhere to the correct line!

    There is no point in arguing about these with our enemies. The enemy curses what we praise, but we praise what the enemy curses. Let us cheer and sing to our heart's content for all that represents light, justice, truth, goodness, and beauty, and let the eulogy of "Long Live!" penetrate deep into people's hearts!

    万岁礼赞
    施展
    我们的国家里充满一片欢乐景象。眼看着这种大好形势，人们从心的深处迸发出对党、对祖国、对人民领袖的赞美、颂扬和爱戴。人们禁不住三呼万岁：总路线万岁，大跃进万岁，人民公社万岁……万岁，亿万人的呼声响遍全国，响彻云霄！
    万岁！这不是一个平常的声音。它表达了我们的革命信念，它充盈着我们的坚强信心，它抒发着我们对于革命事业的热爱和赞美。我们高呼着万岁，昂首阔步，朝着革命的目标走去。然而，我们所赞美的，正是敌人所诅咒的。于是，我们的敌人感到惶恐不安了。我们愈是高呼万岁，他们就愈加疯狂地攻讦、谩骂、诽谤我们。但是六亿人民万众一心，万岁的呼声仍旧以雷霆万钧之势震彻他们的耳鼓。敌对阶级和我们没有共同的立场和感情，没有共同的语言和声音。敌人讨厌和痛恨的，我们更应当喜欢和热爱！
    不过，在我们自己的队伍里，也有极少数人，他们的万岁呼声还不够响亮，甚至叽叽咕咕地说：“喊万岁有什么用？形式主义！”“事物是变化的，万岁——怎会是不朽的？”
    “万岁，万万岁！”，这是劳动人民发自肺腑的声音。情发于衷而形于外，没有对革命事业强烈的热爱，就没有这种响亮、昂扬的声音。万岁声中，有着丰厚的内容，怎么能说是一种“形式主义”！？
    比如我们歌颂：“人民英雄万岁！”那是因为人民英雄不管活着的、死了的，他们的崇高风格和精神都是不朽的。人们从他们的先进事迹和思想中，随时可以获取战胜困难的伟大精神力量，用这种力量鼓舞着自己意志旺盛地去从事革命工作。当我们遇到困难有些缺乏信心时，我们一想起爬雪山、过草地，二万五千里长征的前辈老战士，我们就会立刻抬起头来。刘胡兰不是死了许多年了吗？然而活着的刘胡兰，真是成千上万。我们党的好女儿向秀丽因抢救国家财产自己牺牲了，但是我们的祖国各地的青年同志在学习向秀丽的过程中，却又涌现了千千万万向秀丽式的先进人物！
    我们欢呼人民领袖万岁，也绝不是因为我们不相信生理学上的道理。人们是不能违反自然发展规律的，每个人都须经过出生、成长、衰老、死亡的过程。然而，只有书呆子的死脑筋，才会将生理学上的条条和我们高呼万岁联系起来。人民领袖在我们伟大时代所起的伟大作用是万古长青，永垂不朽的。马克思、列宁虽然逝世了，然而，他们的事业和思想精神仍然在发扬光大，我们从他们的著作中得到了革命斗争的指南，我们继承革命导师的遗志，高举着共产主义的旗帜奋勇前进！人们对于代表马列主义真理、集中体现人民意志，制订和坚持正确路线的人民领袖，当然应当从心底尊敬他、爱戴他、而禁不住高呼万岁！
    和我们的敌人辩论这些，是没有什么意思的。敌人诅咒我们所赞美的东西，我们却赞美敌人所诅咒的东西。让我们对于凡是代表光明的，正义的，真理的，好的，美的东西都尽情地欢呼和歌颂吧，让万岁的礼赞深入人们心灵深处吧！
