    Quick Picking and Quick Collection, Done in One Breath
    In the vast cotton-producing areas, a scene of bumper harvest is everywhere: silver shining, cotton bolls laden. This scene shows that this year's cotton production may increase much more than originally estimated. Thanks to the early, tight, and detailed attention of the Party committees at all levels to the cotton purchasing work, a great situation of fast progress and good quality has also emerged in the purchasing work.
    Doing a good job in cotton purchasing is of great significance for supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, increasing the supply of goods in the market, and increasing the income of communes and commune members. The characteristics of cotton growth also require that it be picked and collected as it fluffs, seizing the opportunity and acting ahead of time rather than lagging behind. This requires the people's communes in cotton-producing areas to pick, dry, and sell quickly; and requires commercial departments to collect, transport, and process quickly. The key is quick picking and quick collection.
    To achieve fast purchasing, on the one hand, the people's communes are required to adopt the method of drying cotton on the field, to achieve same-day picking and same-day sales, to combine specialized transportation with shock transportation, and to give full play to various transportation forces, so that cotton does not enter the team and the team does not store cotton; on the other hand, the commercial departments are required to do a good job in acceptance, weighing, settlement, and warehousing. In order to speed up the purchasing speed and facilitate the sale of cotton by the communes, many places have adopted the method of combining purchasing stations and processing plants, sending the cotton directly to the processing plants, and also adopted auxiliary methods of sending people to the team for acceptance and mobile purchasing, and setting up points for safekeeping. Experience shows that these methods of purchasing that are more, faster, better, and more economical are worth promoting in various places.
    Late October and November are the decisive periods for completing the cotton purchasing task. Opportunities do not come twice. We must seize the opportunity, make persistent efforts, and accomplish the task in one breath. The situation we face is very good, and the objective conditions for completing the cotton purchasing task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target are fully available. As long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, vigorously launch mass movements, continue to oppose right-leaning ideas, and inspire enthusiasm, give full play to our subjective initiative, organize labor, livestock, and transportation tools well, specifically arrange the purchasing plan to the communes, production teams, and cotton processing plants by month, ten-day period, and day, and promote the "one-stop" cotton purchasing movement of organizing picking, sales, acceptance, processing, and transportation to a greater climax, we will certainly be able to complete the cotton purchasing task ahead of schedule and exceed the target.
    The key is to mobilize the masses, boost morale, and pick and collect quickly. It is hoped that the commercial departments and the people's communes will work closely together to ensure that the cotton purchasing work is completed in one go.

### 快摘快收，一气呵成

    快摘快收，一气呵成
    在广大的产棉区，到处呈现着一派丰收景象：银光闪闪，棉桃累累。这番景象表明：今年棉花产量比原来估计的数量可能增加很多。由于各级党委对棉花收购工作抓得早、抓得紧、抓得细，收购工作也出现了进度快、质量好的大好形势。
    做好棉花收购工作对于支援工农业生产大跃进，增加市场货源，增加公社和社员的收入都有重大的意义。棉花生长的特点，也要求随吐絮，随收摘，抓紧时机，赶前不赶后。这就要求棉区人民公社快摘、快晒、快出售；要求商业部门快收、快运、快加工。而其中的关键是快摘、快收购。
    要做到收购快，一方面要求人民公社采取地头晒棉的办法，作到当日摘棉，当日交售，把专业运输与突击运输结合起来，充分发挥各种运输力量，作到花不进队，队不存棉；另一方面要求商业部门作好验收、过秤、结算、入库等工作。为了加快收购速度，便利公社售棉，许多地方采取了收购站与加工厂合一的办法，把棉花直送加工厂，还采取了派人到队验收和流动收购、设点保管的辅助办法。经验表明：这些多快好省的收购办法，值得各地推广。
    10月下旬和11月份是完成棉花收购任务的决定性时期。机不可失，时不再来。我们一定要抓紧时机，一鼓作气，再接再厉，一气呵成。我们面临的形势非常好，提前超额完成棉花收购任务的客观条件完全具备。只要我们紧紧依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发挥主观能动作用，把劳力、畜力和运输工具都组织好，把收购计划分月、分旬、分日地具体安排到公社、生产队和棉花加工厂，把组织采摘、交售、验收、加工和调运“一条龙”的棉花收购运动推向更大的高潮，就一定可以提前超额完成棉花收购任务。
    关键在于发动群众，鼓足干劲，快摘快收。希望商业部门、人民公社紧密结合起来，保证棉花收购工作一气呵成。
