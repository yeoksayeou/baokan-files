Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 15th: The first year after communization, mid-season rice in low-yield fields in Guzhang County, Hunan Province, has seen a general bumper harvest. This year, the average per-mu yield of more than 40,000 mu of low-yield fields in the county is 487 jin, an increase of 64.3% compared to the per-mu yield of the transformed low-yield fields last year, and more than double the per-mu yield of low-yield fields before liberation.

Guzhang County is surrounded by mountains, and most of the paddy fields are distributed on high mountains and steep ridges, with very poor natural conditions. Before liberation, the per-mu yield was only 100 to 200 jin. After liberation, especially from 1956 to 1958 after agricultural cooperativization, the per-mu yield of about 20,000 mu of low-yield fields increased to about 300 jin. Due to the limitations of manpower and material resources at that time, not many low-yield fields were transformed each year, and the increase in production was relatively low. After communization, the situation changed dramatically. Not only were the more than 20,000 mu of low-yield fields that had not been transformed completely transformed, with per-mu yields increasing by one to three times compared to the original, but also the approximately 20,000 mu of low-yield fields that had been transformed were re-processed and transformed, increasing from more than 300 jin per mu to 487 jin.

After realizing communization last winter, the Guzhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the principle of multiple high yields and the requirements of the various ethnic group members in the mountainous areas to produce more grain, issued a call for the comprehensive transformation of low-yield fields. More than 30,000 laborers in the county, braving wind and snow, went up the mountains to set up camps. Party committees at all levels personally took command on the mountains to vigorously transform low-yield fields. One of the main reasons these fields were low-yield in the past was the lack of water conservancy facilities. Although some paddy fields had water for irrigation, they mostly relied on temporary dam construction and water diversion, which were constantly collapsing and being repaired, and had very low drought resistance. In the year after communization, the county built 5,057 water conservancy projects, exceeding the total of the past few years. More than 40,000 mu of low-yield fields basically had water conservancy facilities, generally capable of resisting drought for 30 to 60 days. In the construction of more than 20 large-scale water conservancy projects such as Duanlong Mountain, Shahu Creek, Zexin, and Qinglong Mountain, farmers of the Tujia, Miao, and Han nationalities carried out communist cooperation, fought hard for three months, conquered fierce mountains and evil waters, and tamed mountain floods. More than 4,000 farmers of all ethnic groups fighting on Duanlong Mountain cut off the towering Monkey Ridge and opened up the steep Chang'an Mountain, leading spring water to the arid Tianjiadong area. The construction of these huge water conservancy projects could only be done by the People's Commune. Taking the Duanlong Mountain water conservancy project alone, it used a total of 180,000 labor days, blasting and excavating 199,800 cubic meters of rock and 240,000 cubic meters of sand and soil. All of this was impossible for either a senior cooperative or the original township to do. In terms of soil and water conservation, they created and promoted the "alternate plowing and turning method," while carrying out afforestation and terracing slopes, and opening water inlet ditches in 70% of the paddy fields to prevent floods and cold immersion. In this way, they controlled soil and water loss on 50% to 60% of the county's land. In the struggle against the 82-day severe drought this summer and autumn, the broad masses of commune members continued to climb mountains and drill holes, digging out more than 1,000 "underground water" sources, and newly installed 19 water pumps, persisting in drought resistance, which ensured this year's bumper harvest.

These low-yield fields are located in high mountains and far away, and the fields are scattered. Before cooperativization, they generally did not apply fertilizer. After cooperativization, due to the lack of labor for transporting fertilizer, even if a lot of fertilizer was accumulated, it could not all be transported to the fields. After communization, the commune exerted its great power, and a mass movement to accumulate and transport fertilizer, involving 70% of the labor force, was launched throughout the county. The average accumulation of fertilizer per mu was 500 dan in winter and spring, more than double the amount per mu last year, and it was done while accumulating, transporting, and applying, eliminating blank fields (fields without fertilizer).

While accumulating fertilizer, a large-scale mass movement to transform the soil was also launched. Throughout the county, about 30,000 mu of sandy fields were covered with yellow mud, cohesive soil was mixed with sandy soil, thin soil layers were thickened, and the number of plowing and harrowing was appropriately increased according to the field and soil quality. The shallow and infertile Tian Shui fields generally underwent eight plowing and eight harrowing. More than 30% of the county's fields were deeply ploughed to more than one chi.

### 公社化带来秋季大丰收  古丈四万亩中稻变高产  平均亩产量比去年增长六成多

　　公社化带来秋季大丰收
    古丈四万亩中稻变高产
    平均亩产量比去年增长六成多
    新华社长沙15日电　公社化后的第一年，湖南省古丈县低产田中稻普遍大丰收。全县四万多亩低产田，今年中稻平均亩产四百八十七斤，比去年改造的低产田亩产量增长64.3％，比解放前低产田的亩产量增长两倍以上。
    古丈县万山重叠，大部分稻田分布在高山陡岭上面，自然条件很差。解放前亩产量只有一、二百斤。解放后，特别是农业合作化后的1956年到1958年，才使两万亩左右低产田的亩产量增加到三百斤左右。由于当时人力物力的限制，每年改造的低产田还不多，增产幅度也比较低。公社化以后，形势起了大变化，不但把原来没有改造的两万多亩低产田全部改造了，亩产量比原来增长一倍到三倍，而且把原来改造过的两万亩左右的低产田也再次加工改造，从亩产三百多斤提高到四百八十七斤。
    去年冬天实现公社化后，中共古丈县委根据多种高产多收的方针和山区各族社员多产粮食的要求，发出了全面改造低产田的号召。全县三万多劳动队伍，冒着风雪，上山扎营，各级党委亲自上山挂帅，大力改造低产田。这些田过去低产的主要原因之一，是缺乏水利设施，部分稻田虽然有水灌溉，也多半依赖于临时筑坝和接流架枧，时垮时修，抗旱能力很低。公社化后的一年来，全县兴修的水利工程达五千零五十七处，超过几年来的总和，四万多亩低产田基本上都有了水利设施，一般能抗旱三十天到六十天。在兴修断龙山、杀虎溪、泽信、青龙山等二十多处巨大水利工程中，土家族、苗族和汉族农民实行共产主义大协作，奋战三个月，征服了凶山恶水，驯服了山洪。战斗在断龙山上的四千多各族农民，削去了巍峨的猴儿岭，打开了陡如屏障的长安山，把泉水引到干旱的田家洞一带。这些巨大水利工程的兴建，只有人民公社才能办到，单就断龙山水利工程来说，共用了十八万个劳动日，劈炸岩石十九万九千八百立方米，挖掘砂土二十四万立方米。所有这些，无论是一个高级社或原来的一个乡都是做不到的。在水土保持方面，他们创造和推广了“隔犁翻土法”，同时进行植树造林和坡地改梯田，在70％的稻田里开了进水沟防洪防冷浸水。这样，就控制了全县50％到60％土地上的水土流失。在今年夏秋与八十二天的特大干旱作斗争中，广大社员又继续登山钻洞，挖出“阴水”一千多处，并新安装了十九台抽水机，坚持抗旱，才确保了今年大丰收。
    这些低产田山高路远，田土分散，合作化前一般都不施肥。合作化后，由于运肥劳力少，即是积了很多肥料也不能全部运到田里。公社化后，公社发挥巨大威力，全县范围内又掀起了有70％劳力参加的积肥运肥运动，一冬一春平均每亩积肥达五百担，比去年每亩增加一倍以上，并且做到了边积边运边施放，消灭了空白田（不下肥的田）。
    在积肥的同时，并开展大规模改造土壤的群众运动。全县约将三万多亩砂田加盖了黄泥，粘性田掺进了砂土，薄土加厚了土层，并看田看土质适当地增加犁耙次数，土质瘦薄的天水田一般都进行了八犁八耙。全县有30％以上的田深耕一尺以上。
