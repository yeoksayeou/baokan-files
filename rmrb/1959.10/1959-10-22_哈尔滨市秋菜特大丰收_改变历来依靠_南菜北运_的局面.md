    Harbin Achieves Record Autumn Vegetable Harvest
    Changing the Past Reliance on "Southern Vegetables Transported North"
    This year, Harbin's suburban areas have achieved a record autumn vegetable harvest. According to actual measurements and the already harvested area, the total autumn vegetable production of the city is estimated to reach 1.5 billion jin, more than double that of last year. Based on a consumption of 1.5 jin per person per day, this is enough to feed all the people of Harbin for eight months. From now on, Harbin will fundamentally change the past situation of relying on "Southern Vegetables Transported North."
    Currently, members of the suburban People's Communes are working intensively to rush-harvest, rush-transport, and cellar autumn vegetables, striving for a bumper harvest.
    The characteristics of Harbin's bumper autumn vegetable harvest this year are high yield, good quality, and the emergence of many large-scale high-yield fields and high-yield records. For example, the 1,087 hectares of ox-heart cabbage in Jiangjia Commune, Zhaodong County, directly under Harbin City, averaged 60,000 jin per hectare. Cabbage in Changsheng Management Area, Dongfeng Commune, Taiping suburb, yielded 250,000 jin per hectare. Kohlrabi in the Democratic Production Team, First Management Area, Xinfa Commune, averaged 165,000 jin per hectare. Radishes in Wangzhao Management Area, Yuejin Commune, Nangang District, yielded 181,500 jin per hectare.
    This year's bumper autumn vegetable harvest in Harbin is the result of conscientiously implementing the policy of prioritizing vegetable production in the suburbs.

    哈尔滨市秋菜特大丰收
    改变历来依靠“南菜北运”的局面
    哈尔滨市郊区今年秋菜特大丰收。根据实测和已经收获的面积推算，全市秋菜总产量可达十五亿斤，比去年增加一倍多，以一个人一天吃一斤半计算，足够哈尔滨全市人民吃八个月。从此，哈尔滨市根本改变了历来依靠“南菜北运”的局面。
    目前，郊区人民公社社员正紧张地进行抢收、抢运和窖藏秋菜，力争丰产丰收。
    哈尔滨市今年秋菜丰收的特点是，产量高、质量好，并且出现了许多大面积丰产田和高产纪录。如哈尔滨市直属的肇东县姜家公社一千零八十七公顷多牛心菜，平均每公顷产六万斤。市郊太平东风公社常胜管理区白菜每公顷产二十五万斤。市郊新发公社第一管理区民主生产队大头菜平均每公顷产一十六万五千斤。南岗区跃进公社王兆管理区大萝卜每公顷产一十八万一千五百斤。
    今年哈尔滨市秋菜大丰收，是由于认真贯彻执行了近郊区生产以蔬菜为主的方针的结果。
