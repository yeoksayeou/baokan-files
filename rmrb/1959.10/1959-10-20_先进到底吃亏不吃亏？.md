　　Is Being Advanced Really a Disadvantage?
　　Doumen Commune uses detailed accounting to illustrate that advancement comes from the leadership of the Party and the support of the state; advanced units see increased production year after year, and commune members' incomes gradually increase, making the "disadvantage" theory baseless.

    (Our dispatch) The CCP Shaoxing County Doumen Commune Party Committee, on the basis of organizing cadres above the production team level to study the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, used the methods of presenting facts, reasoning, detailed accounting, and linking with reality to powerfully criticize the erroneous notion of "advanced units suffer" held by a few cadres, giving all cadres a profound socialist education.

    Due to the strong support of the state and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, last year the Sanjiang Production Team, like other teams, achieved bumper harvests of rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops. To support the country's socialist construction, this team sold a portion of its surplus grain. From then on, they started saying things like "being advanced is a disadvantage," and "being backward is advantageous."

    During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that this kind of thinking is essentially a reflection of the wavering of some well-to-do middle peasants towards the socialist revolution, and that in order to defend the Party's General Line, an irreconcilable struggle must be waged against this kind of argument. At the meeting, the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and detailed accounting was used to first help the Sanjiang Production Team recall and compare the tremendous changes that have taken place in all aspects over the past ten years since liberation. The Sanjiang Production Team is located at the Sanjiang estuary, with alkaline and barren soil, and is often subject to tidal invasions. Before liberation, the average rice yield per mu was only 202 jin, and the commune members' annual rations were only around 200 jin, with the vast majority of farmers living in extreme poverty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of peasants resolutely took the road of mutual aid and cooperation and people's communes, thereby guaranteeing that production increased year by year: in 1955, the average yield per mu was 565 jin, in 1957 it was 796 jin, and in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 it reached 1,013 jin. Due to the development of production, the income of commune members also increased continuously: in 1956, the average per household was 277 yuan, in 1958 it reached 415 yuan per household, excluding the supply portion, and this year, in addition to implementing the grain supply system, it is estimated that each commune member household can distribute 635 yuan in cash.

    Next, everyone discussed the question of why the Sanjiang Production Team had changed so quickly and where its advancement came from. Everyone unanimously agreed that the most important reason was the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the correctness of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. The iron facts prove that if it were not for the Party leading the peasants to thoroughly liberate themselves politically and making every effort to vigorously lead the peasants to develop production, the commune members of the Sanjiang Production Team could not have increased production year after year, no matter how hard they tried, and their lives could not have improved year after year; if it were not for the Party's General Line, the Sanjiang Production Team could not have had last year's comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Everyone also specifically helped the Sanjiang Team calculate several large accounts: over the past ten years, the state has given the Sanjiang Production Team loans totaling more than 39,000 yuan. These loans were all used wisely to help them develop production. Before liberation, the Sanjiang Production Team was simply unable to repair the seawall that suffered disasters every year, so large tracts of land were often hit by tides. After liberation, more than 15,000 workers from eight districts helped them rush to repair the seawall, thus ensuring that the seawall has been peaceful and uneventful for nearly ten years. Because the team was relatively backward in all aspects in the past, the higher-level Party committee often sent cadres to the team to mobilize the masses and lead production in recent years. Especially after communization, the land of the Sanjiang Production Team, which was originally scattered in five townships of three districts, was completely adjusted. Because distant fields became nearby fields and the land was connected into pieces, a large amount of labor was saved and invested in production. According to the commune's requirement for comprehensive economic development, the vegetable planting area of the Sanjiang Production Team alone has more than doubled, and this year's total vegetable income reached 75,000 yuan, with an average of 220 yuan distributed to each household; recently, when harvesting sweet potatoes, the Sanjiang Production Team lacked labor, and the commune mobilized a large number of laborers from all aspects to support them. This year, the state also supplied them with more than 39,000 jin of chemical fertilizers.

    "Is being advanced really a disadvantage?" In the debate, everyone unanimously believed that the output of the Sanjiang Production Team has been increasing year by year, the income of the commune members has also been increasing year by year, and their lives have been getting better year by year. The idea that being advanced is a disadvantage simply does not exist. Moreover, because of the high output, selling the surplus grain to the state makes a great contribution to socialist construction, and cannot be regarded as a disadvantage. Since 1957, the Sanjiang Production Team has been rated as an advanced unit in the county and province due to its high output, and the material rewards it has received alone include a water pump, two rice threshers, two sprayers, a deep plowing plow, a double-wheeled double-blade plow, and a universal processing machine. This is not only a great encouragement to the commune members in spirit, but also plays a great role in the development of production. During the discussion, the cadres of the Yuejin Production Team examined the so-called "advanced suffers losses" issue in light of their own leadership ideas and the actual situation of their team. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the team's average grain yield per mu reached more than 700 jin due to their hard work. However, since the beginning of this year, due to the fact that a few cadres once had the idea of "advanced suffers losses," under their influence, some of the masses also lacked strong ambition to strive for the upstream, and their energy was not boosted. Thus, the average yield of early rice this year was lower than last year, and the growth of late rice was also worse than other teams. They deeply realized that exerting great effort and striving for the upstream is not only beneficial to socialist construction, but also has direct benefits for themselves.

    Through the debate, all cadres received a profound socialist education and became more firm in the socialist direction. Everyone expressed their determination to resolutely break with all weak and passive backward emotions, and to lead the masses forward with greater effort to strive for greater leaps forward.

　　先进到底吃亏不吃亏？
　　斗门公社用算细账的办法，说明先进来自党的领导和国家支援；先进单位产量逐年提高，社员收入逐步增多，“吃亏”论毫无根据。
    本报讯　中共浙江绍兴县斗门公社党委在组织生产队以上干部学习党的八届八中全会决议的基础上，用摆事实、讲道理、算细账、联系实际的方法，有力地批判了少数干部存在的“先进吃亏”的错误论调，使全体干部受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    由于国家大力支援和发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，去年三江生产队和其他队一样，无论水稻、番薯等农作物均获得了大丰收。为了支援国家社会主义建设，这个队出售了一部分超产粮。从这开始，他们就说什么“先进吃亏”、“落后便宜”。
    在讨论中，大家一致认为，这种思想实质就是一部分富裕中农对社会主义革命动摇的思想反映，为了保卫党的总路线，必须和这种论调开展不调和的斗争。会上以摆事实、讲道理、算细账的办法，首先帮助三江生产队回忆对比了解放十年来各方面所发生的巨大变化。三江生产队地处三江海口，土质碱性瘠薄，常受潮水侵袭。解放前，平均水稻亩产只有二百零二斤，社员每年口粮只有二百斤上下，绝大部分农民过着极为贫困的生活。解放后，广大农民在党的领导下，坚决走互助合作和人民公社的道路，从而保证产量年年提高：1955年平均亩产五百六十五斤，1957年七百九十六斤，到大跃进的1958年达一千零十三斤。由于生产的发展，社员收入也随着不断增加：1956年每户平均二百七十七元，1958年不包括供给部分，每户达四百一十五元，今年除了实行粮食供给制以外，预计每户社员可分现金六百三十五元。
    接着，大家以三江生产队为什么变化这样快，先进从哪里来为题进行了讨论。一致认为，最重要的原因是由于党和毛主席的英明领导、总路线和大跃进的正确和人民公社的无比优越性。铁的事实证明：要不是党领导农民从政治上彻底翻身和千方百计大力领导农民发展生产，三江生产队的社员用再大的努力也不可能使产量年年增加，生活也不可能年年提高；要不是党的总路线，三江生产队也就不可能有去年的全面大跃进。大家还具体帮助三江队算了几笔大账：十年来，国家给三江生产队的贷款达三万九千多元。这些贷款都是用在刀口上，帮助他们发展了生产。解放以前，三江生产队根本无力整修年年闹灾的海塘，因而大片田地动不动就要遭到潮水冲击。解放后，有八个区的一万五千多个民工帮助他们抢修了海塘，这样就保证了近十年来海塘年年太平无事。由于该队过去各方面都处于较落后状态，几年来，上级党委经常派干部到该队发动群众、领导生产。特别是公社化以后，三江生产队原来分散在三个区五个乡的土地，全部进行了调整。由于远田变近田，土地连成片，就节省了大量劳动力投入了生产。根据公社全面发展经济的要求，三江生产队仅蔬菜种植面积就扩大了一倍以上，今年蔬菜总收入达七万五千元，平均每户分到二百二十元；最近收番薯时，三江生产队劳力不足，公社又从各方面调动了大批劳力来支援他们。今年国家还供应给他们三万九千多斤化学肥料。
    “先进到底吃亏不吃亏？”在辩论中大家一致认为，三江生产队的产量逐年提高，社员的收入也逐年增加，生活也一年比一年好，先进吃亏的事情是根本不存在的。再说，因为产量高，把多余的超产粮卖给国家，这对社会主义建设有着很大的贡献，更不能算是吃亏。自1957年来，三江生产队由于产量高，接连被评为县和省的先进单位，仅受到的物质奖励就有抽水机一部、打稻机两部、喷雾器两架、深耕犁一张、双轮双铧犁一张、万能加工机一部。这不仅对社员精神上是一个很大的鼓舞，对发展生产也起了很大的作用。在讨论中，跃进生产队的干部对所谓“先进吃亏”的问题，联系自己的领导思想和本队的实际情况进行了检查。在大跃进的1958年，该队由于干劲足，因而全年粮食平均亩产量达到七百多斤。但是，今年以来，由于少数干部也曾经一度产生了所谓“先进吃亏”的思想，在他们的影响下，部分群众也缺乏强烈的争上游的雄心大志，干劲始终鼓不高，这样，今年早稻平均产量就比去年有所降低，晚稻生长也比其他队差。他们深深体会到，鼓足干劲，力争上游，是既有利于社会主义建设，对自己也有着直接利益。
    通过辩论，全体干部都受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，更加坚定了社会主义方向。大家表示坚决和一切软弱无力的消极落后情绪决裂，以更大的干劲带领群众勇往直前，争取更大跃进。
