    Seeing Ghosts in Broad Daylight
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu
    News reports: A group of fascist writers in West Germany are reviving. Ivory doesn't come from a dog's mouth, and cotton yarn can't be spun in a stove. West Germany also has cultural news; could my eyes be deceiving me? The news mentions a writer who was somewhat popular more than a decade ago, Hans Grimm is his name, and today he's out shaking and swaggering again. He reprinted his work, "A People Without Space." Want to know what it's about? Please read the book's preface. Praising the Nazis is the characteristic of this article. He actually described Hitler as a "reformer"! This news is very valuable, it reminds us constantly: There are classes unwilling to die, and there will be poisonous snakes growing teeth again!

    报载：西德一批法西斯作家复活狗狗嘴里不出象牙，火炉里不纺棉纱。西德也有文化新闻，莫非我眼睛发花？新闻讲到一位作家，十几年前红过一下，汉斯·格里姆是他名字，今天又出来摇摇摆摆。他重印了他的作品，“没有空间的人民”，欲知内容如何？请看书的序文。对纳粹歌功颂德，便是此文特色。他居然把希特勒说成是“革新者”！这条新闻很有价值，它叫我们时时记得：有不甘心死亡的阶级，就会有重长牙齿毒蛇！
