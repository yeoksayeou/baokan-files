Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 17th: The 100,000 workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) have recently set new struggle goals: to complete this year's steel and coke production plans ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, to complete this year's basic construction plans fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule, and to prepare for an even greater leap forward next year. In order to achieve the above goals victoriously, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee convened a cadre meeting on the 14th to make specific arrangements for various tasks.

In the third quarter, WISCO's production and basic construction made an all-round leap forward. Since entering October, victories have been reported one after another. The newly put into production No. 1 large open-hearth furnace had exceeded its national plan for the first half of October by more than 300 tons by the 14th, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel had broken the design target seven times in succession; No. 1 and No. 2 large blast furnaces produced more than 230 tons of iron per day in the first half of October compared with September. Various key projects are advancing rapidly. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace, which started construction on September 21, had completed the installation of the main body's metal structural components by October 15 and began to build the melting chamber. The builders are striving to complete this open-hearth furnace and produce steel in November.

The fourth quarter is the decisive quarter for WISCO to complete this year's national plan. In terms of production, there are still five-fourths of the annual steel production task and 43% of the annual pig iron task to be completed in these three months. In terms of construction, five major projects, including No. 2 open-hearth furnace, No. 3 and No. 4 sintering machines, three rows of flotation machines, No. 4 coke oven, and the refractory material plant, will be completed and put into production one after another; the primary rolling mill will also complete all civil construction work within the year and begin the installation of some metal components. These projects are not only related to the early completion of WISCO's production plan this year, but also are of great significance for the continued leap forward next year.

At the cadre meeting held on the 14th, Li Yiqing, Secretary of the WISCO Party Committee and General Manager, analyzed the current extremely favorable situation and called on all cadres to seize the opportunity, mobilize the masses to make another effort, and resolutely complete the annual plan ahead of schedule. In terms of basic construction, he proposed that this year must prepare for next year's construction, submit the design of the projects to be started in the first quarter of next year as soon as possible, and prepare the leveling, construction facilities, and materials for the newly started projects as soon as possible; the five major projects, including No. 2 open-hearth furnace, No. 3 and No. 4 sintering machines, three rows of flotation machines, No. 4 coke oven, and the refractory material plant, must be completed this year to ensure that these projects are completed on schedule; hundreds of finishing projects must be completed this year, and a comprehensive and thorough mopping-up campaign must be launched on all fronts to complete all projects that can be completed. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the practice of dividing forces and dispersing strength, concentrate forces, carry out successive assaults, and complete projects in batches; we must resolutely prevent paying attention to the beginning but not the end, being tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and ensure that we have a beginning and an end and carry things through to the end. In terms of production, Li Yiqing asked all employees to have great ambitions, catch up with the advanced, and complete the daily output targets of steel and iron ahead of schedule month by month according to the original plan, completing the November target in October and the December target in November.

At the cadre meeting, the Party Committee called on all employees to thoroughly criticize the various right-leaning conservative ideas existing among some cadres, further carry out the socialist labor emulation campaign centered on high output, high quality, and low cost, learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, and struggle for the early, comprehensive, and over-fulfillment of this year's national plan.

　　武钢十万职工提出新的奋战目标
    争取提前半月完成全年生产建设计划
    新华社武汉17日电　武钢十万职工最近订出了新的奋斗目标：提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁、焦炭生产计划，提前十五天到二十天完成今年的基本建设计划，并为明年的更大跃进作好准备。为了胜利实现上述目标，武汉钢铁公司党委在14日召开干部大会，对各项工作作了具体的安排。
    第三季度，武钢生产、基本建设全面跃进，进入10月以后，更是连战连捷。新投入生产的一号大型平炉，到14日止就超额三百多吨完成了10月上半月的国家计划，每炉钢的冶炼时间先后七次突破设计指标；一、二号大型高炉10月上半月比9月份，每天要多出二百三十多吨铁。各项重点工程在飞速前进着。9月21日开工建设的二号平炉，10月15日已经完成了本体的金属结构件安装，开始砌筑熔炼室，建设者们正在力争在11月把这座平炉建成出钢。
    第四季度是武钢完成今年国家计划的决战性季度。在生产上，还有占年产量五分之四的钢产任务，占年产量43％的生铁任务，要在这三个月内完成；在建设上，二号平炉，三号、四号烧结机，三列浮选机，四号焦炉和耐火材料厂等五大工程，都要先后建成投入生产；初轧厂也要在年内完成全部土木建筑工程，并开始部分金属构件的安装。这些工程不仅关系到武钢今年生产计划的提前完成，而且对明年的继续跃进具有重要意义。
    在14日举行的干部大会上，武钢党委书记兼总经理李一清分析了当前极为有利的形势，号召全体干部抓紧时机，发动群众再鼓一把劲，坚决提前完成全年计划。在基本建设方面，他提出今年必须为明年建设作好准备，要及早交出明年一季度开工项目的设计，及早进行新开工项目的平土、施工设施和材料准备等；必须在今年内完成二号平炉、三号四号烧结机、三列浮选机、四号焦炉、耐火材料厂等五大项工程，确保这些工程按期竣工；必须在今年内完成几百项收尾工程，要在各个战场上发起全面彻底的扫荡战，把可以结尾的工程全部完成。因此，要坚决反对分兵把守、分散力量的做法，集中力量，分批突击，分批完成；要坚决防止顾头不顾尾，前紧后松，做到有始有终，一竿子插到底。在生产方面，李一清要求全体职工立大志气，赶先进，钢、铁的日产量指标要按原计划逐月提前完成，10月完成11月的指标，11月完成12月的指标。
    在干部大会上，党委会号召全体职工要彻底批判部分干部中存在着的各种各样的右倾保守思想，进一步开展以高产、优质、低成本为中心的学先进、比先进、赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，为提前、全面、超额完成今年的国家计划而斗争。
