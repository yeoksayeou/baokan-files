    "Barren Land" Yields Fragrant Rice
    Ningxia Gains Preliminary Experience in Transforming White Alkali Soil
    Yinchuan, October 27 (by our newspaper) – Scientific workers in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have taken another step forward in their work to conquer the "barren land" – white alkali soil.
    White alkali soil is distributed in areas such as Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. In the Yinchuan irrigation area of Ningxia alone, there are 700,000 mu of this type of soil, accounting for 8% of the cultivated land in the irrigation area. White alkali soil is a type of white, hard, alkaline soil with a smooth, cracked surface. When dry, the ground is like cement, so hard that it is impossible to plow; when wet, it becomes a slurry. Because of its very poor water permeability, water accumulates for a long time after rain, and nothing grows on this type of land. Foreign and Chinese experts call it "barren land," and local farmers call it "smooth cement road." Until last year, no successful improvement methods had been found for transforming this soil. After the start of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, encouraged by the Party's general line for socialist construction, the staff of the Ningxia Saline-Alkali Soil Improvement Experiment Station broke down superstitions, liberated their thinking, and boldly tried planting rice on white alkali soil. They succeeded in the same year, thus ending the history of white alkali soil as unusable land. This year, the experiment station again successfully planted rice on white alkali soil.
    The main methods used by this experiment station for planting rice on white alkali soil are as follows: ① When planting rice on this type of land, the water must be changed frequently. This can remove the alkaline water in a timely manner and reduce the "internal ions" in the white alkali soil that are most harmful to crops. However, if the water is changed too frequently, fertilizer is easily lost. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to frequently measure the changes in the acidity and alkalinity of the water in the field and the water temperature. Last year, due to a lack of experience, the water was changed too frequently (every one or two days), resulting in fertilizer loss. This year, the changes in acidity and alkalinity are strictly controlled, and the water is generally changed once every five days, with very good results. ② According to the characteristics of white alkali soil, which is highly alkaline and has poor fertility, more organic fertilizer should be applied, because acidic fertilizer can neutralize the alkalinity in the white alkali soil. ③ In order to change the hard, poorly ventilated, and poorly permeable properties of white alkali soil, the land should be deeply plowed, to a depth of about one chi (approximately one foot). In addition, silt should be added in conjunction with irrigation to thicken the soil layer, which can also improve the fertility of the white alkali soil.
    This year, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region expanded its research on white alkali soil compared to last year. In addition to planting rice, crops such as sweet clover, broad beans, millet, and spinach were also planted. Although these crops grew relatively short, they all survived. This proves that dry crops can also be planted on white alkali soil.
    Scientific activities for researching and improving white alkali soil in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have been launched in many areas. In the Chaohu area at the foot of Helan Mountain, at the junction of saline soil and white alkali soil, and around sand dunes, methods such as windbreaks, digging profiles, and installing underground observation wells are used to regularly observe and study soil changes. The Saline-Alkali Soil Improvement Experiment Station has also established a laboratory and a weather station here, analyzing soil and water quality changes on a regular basis, observing temperature, rainfall, wind direction, wind force, and other conditions, and sending a group of soil workers to conduct soil surveys in conjunction with the masses. In the Xidatan area, which has a large area of white alkali soil, traces of villages left hundreds of years ago were also found, indicating that these areas were once cultivated. Based on a large number of facts, soil workers have initially determined the nature and formation process of white alkali soil, which theoretically identifies the root cause of white alkali soil and makes it possible to purposefully improve the soil.
    Currently, the staff of the Ningxia Saline-Alkali Soil Improvement Experiment Station are summarizing the research results of the past two years and preparing to write papers to introduce the experience of transforming white alkali soil to various regions. (Attached image)

    “不毛之地”稻谷香
    宁夏改造白僵土取得初步经验
    本报银川27日电　宁夏回族自治区的科学工作者，在征服“不毛之地”——白僵土的工作上又跨进了一步。
    白僵土分布在宁夏、内蒙古、新疆等地区，仅宁夏银川灌区就有七十万亩这种土地，占灌区耕地面积8％。白僵土是一种白色坚硬的碱化土壤，表面平滑，呈龟裂状。干燥时，地面像水门汀，坚硬的不能下犁；阴湿时，又变为稀泥。由于透水性能很差，雨后长时间积水不干，这种土地寸草不长，中外专家称为“不毛之地”，当地农民叫它“光板洋灰马路”。如何改造这种土壤，直到去年以前，还找不出改良成功的资料。1958年大跃进开始后，宁夏盐碱土改良试验站的工作人员，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，破除迷信，解放思想，大胆的在白僵土上试种水稻，当年就获得成功，从而结束了白僵土不能开发利用的历史。今年，这个试验站再次在白僵土上试种水稻，也获得了成功。
    这个试验站在白僵土上种植水稻的主要办法有以下几条：①在这种土地上种植水稻要勤换水，这样可以把含碱的水及时排出去，减少白僵土中对作物危害最大的“内离子”。可是换水次数过多，肥料容易消失，解决这个矛盾，就得经常测量田中水分酸碱度的变化和水温。去年因为缺乏这种经验，换水太勤（每隔一二天换一次），结果冲失了肥料。今年严格掌握酸碱度变化，一般改成五天换水一次，效果很好。②根据白僵土碱性大、肥力差的特点，应该多施有机肥料，因为酸性肥料能够中和白僵土中的碱性。③为了改变白僵土坚硬，通气、透水差的性能，要深翻土地，深度以一尺左右为宜。此外，要结合灌水进行放淤，加厚土层，这也能提高白僵土的肥力。
    今年宁夏回族自治区对白僵土的研究工作比去年扩大，除种植水稻外，还种了香豆子、蚕豆、糜子、菠菜等作物，这些作物生长得虽然比较矮小，但都成活了。这就证明白僵土也能种植旱作物。
    宁夏回族自治区研究和改良白僵土的科学活动已经在许多地区展开。在贺兰山下的潮湖地区，在盐土和白僵土交接处，以及沙丘周围，采用风障、挖剖面及安装地下观察井等方法，定期观察，研究土壤的变化。盐碱土改良试验站在这里还设立了化验室、气象站，定时分析土壤及水质变化，观察气温、雨量、风向、风力等情况，并派出一批土壤工作者结合群众进行土壤普查。在有着大片白僵土的西大滩地区，还找到了几百年前遗留下来的村庄痕迹，这些事实说明这些地区曾经是有人耕种过的。土壤工作者根据大量事实已初步确定白僵土的性质和形成过程，这就从理论上找到了白僵土的病根子，从而有可能有目的的进行白僵土的改良工作。
    目前，宁夏盐碱土改良试验站的人员，正在总结这两年来的研究成果，准备写成论文，向各地介绍改造白僵土的经验。（附图片）
