Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: A rally of more than 1,300 Tokyo citizens against the revision of the "Security Treaty" was held in Tokyo last night.

This rally was hosted by the New Japan Literature Association. Ten well-known writers and critics, including Kenzo Nakajima, spoke at the meeting, unanimously calling on the audience to unite to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" in order to save the crisis of the Japanese nation.

Kenzo Nakajima pointed out that at a time when international tensions are easing, the issue of comprehensive disarmament has become a practical topic, and the situation is constantly changing, if Japan revises the "Security Treaty," then in the next ten years Japan will be further drawn into the US military system and will bear the task of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the American warmongers. Nakajima called on the participants to seize every opportunity to expose the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty."

In his speech, Shigeharu Nakano exposed the deceptive nature of the Kishida Nobusuke government's claim that the relationship between Japan and the United States would become "completely equal" after the treaty revision and that the new treaty stipulates that the US military would "consult in advance" with Japan when deploying from Japan to fight abroad. Nakano emphasized that relying on "Japan-US joint defense" cannot guarantee peace in the Far East, and only the withdrawal of the United States and non-interference in the Far East can maintain peace in the Far East. Nakano called on the Japanese people to unite and launch a struggle to eliminate the villains who make money by relying on armament.

Japanese well-known commentator Katsuiro Kamei published an article in the "Asahi Shimbun" on the 15th, opposing the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty." Kamei said that in the current era, military alliances are meaningless. No matter how detailed the provisions are, in fact, the US military will probably act arbitrarily.

Kamei pointed out that the "Security Treaty" takes the Soviet Union and China as imaginary enemies. Kamei further pointed out that the Japanese should not forget the responsibility for the long-term aggression against China in the past. Kamei believes that in Japan-China relations, the Japanese need to remember these two points at a minimum: do not regard China as an imaginary enemy and do not give the other party such an impression. He said that this possibility is the fundamental yardstick for deciding whether to support or oppose the "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: The Executive Council meeting of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today formulated a policy to strengthen the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and to oppose the dismissal of workers. This policy will be discussed and adopted at the Sohyo extraordinary convention to be held on the 19th.

The policy decided to hold regional general mobilization rallies in Kyushu and Hokkaido in early November under the slogans of preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and opposing the dismissal of coal miners. The policy decided to hold the eighth national unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" on November 27; to hold the ninth national unified action on December 10; and to prepare for a general strike when unified actions are held.

Sohyo also decided to raise funds from union members to support the coal miners' struggle against layoffs.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: The 14th regular convention of the National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Organizations of Japan, which was held in Sendai City from the 12th, closed yesterday. The conference passed a resolution expressing its determination to launch a resolute struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty."

The resolution passed by this group of small business owners pointed out that the root cause of the government's levying of harsh taxes on small industrialists and businessmen lies in the rearmament policy and the Japan-US "security system." Therefore, in order to reduce the tax burden, it is necessary to unite with people of other classes and launch a struggle to smash the Japan-US "security system."

The policy stipulates that in order to achieve the above goals, the Federation will unite small industrialists and businessmen who have not yet been organized and strengthen its alliance with trade unions and farmers' organizations.

　　日本人民反对“安全条约”运动走向高潮
    东京市民集会揭穿岸政府投靠美国的花言巧语
    “总评”干事会会议决定发动工人展开总罢工
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：东京昨晚举行了有一千三百多名市民参加的反对修改“安全条约”的集会。
    这个集会是由新日本文学会主持举行的。中岛健藏等十名著名作家和评论家在会上讲话，一致呼吁听众团结起来，阻止修改“安全条约”，以拯救日本民族的危机。
    中岛健藏指出，在国际紧张局势趋向缓和，全面裁军问题成为现实的课题并且形势时时刻刻在变化的时候，日本如果修改了“安全条约”，那么在以后的十年内日本将被进一步拉入美国军事体系中，并且将担负替美国战争贩子火中取栗的任务。中岛号召与会者抓住各种机会，揭露修改“安全条约”的危险性。
    中野重治在讲话中揭穿了岸信介政府所散布的所谓条约修改后日美两国关系将成为“完全平等”和在新条约里规定美军从日本开到外国作战时要同日本“事先协商”的欺骗性。中野强调指出，依靠“日美共同防卫”保不住远东和平，只有美国撤出和不干涉远东才能维护远东和平。中野呼吁日本人民团结起来展开斗争，消灭依靠备战赚钱的坏蛋。
    日本著名评论家龟井胜一郎15日在“朝日新闻”上发表文章，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”。龟井说，在目前的时代，军事同盟是没有意义的。无论把条文订得怎样详细，事实上恐怕都将由美军独断专行。
    龟井指出，“安全条约”是以苏联和中国为假想敌国的。龟井进一步指出，日本人不应该忘记的是过去长期侵略中国的责任。龟井认为，在日中关系上，日本人最低限度需要记住这两点：不要把中国看作是一个假想敌国，不要使对方获得这样的印象。他说，这一可能是决定对“安全条约”表示赞成还是反对的根本尺度。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会干事会会议今天拟定了加强阻止修改日美“安全条约”和反对解雇工人的斗争方针。这项方针将在19日召开的“总评”临时大会上讨论和通过。
    方针决定11月上旬在阻止修改“安全条约”、要求恢复日中邦交、反对解雇煤矿工人的口号下，在九州和北海道两地举行区域性的总奋起大会。方针决定，在11月27日举行阻止修改“安全条约”第八次全国统一行动；12月10日举行第九次全国统一行动；在举行统一行动时还要准备举行总罢工。
    “总评”还决定向各个工会会员募款，以支援煤矿工会的反对解雇的斗争。
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本全国商工团体联合会从12日起在仙台市举行的第十四次定期大会于昨天闭幕。大会通过决议，表示要为阻止修改日美“安全条约”而展开坚决的斗争。
    这个小企业主的团体所通过的决议指出，政府向小工商业者征收苛税的根源在于重新武装的政策和日美“安全体系”。因此，要减轻税捐负担必须同其他阶级人民团结起来，展开粉碎日美“安全体系”的斗争。
    方针规定，为了实现上述目标，联合会将团结尚未组织起来的小工商业者，并且加强同工会和农民团体的联合。（附图片）
