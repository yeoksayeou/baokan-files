    Fighting Drought and Eliminating Pests
    Jiangxi Ensures Late Rice Acreage of 12 Million Mu Exceeds Early Rice
    (Our report) In order to ensure that the late rice harvest exceeds the early rice harvest, people's communes in Jiangxi Province are launching a high tide of field management centered on preserving seedlings, preserving ears, and preserving grains for the late rice harvest.
    This year, the 12 million mu of double-cropping late rice in Jiangxi Province are generally growing well due to the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. However, drought and insect pests in some areas pose a significant threat to the late rice harvest. The drought situation continues to develop in the Jiujiang and Yichun regions. To ensure sufficient water for the late rice to flower and pollinate, all localities are focusing on the crucial stages of ear and grain development, concentrating their main efforts, and adopting various measures to combat the drought by all possible means. The Jiujiang region is implementing large-scale operations, organizing 330,000 laborers to dig rivers, build dams, sink wells, dredge streams, and tap springs, deploying over 100,000 waterwheels, over 70 tractors, and over 250 pumps, irrigating more than 200,000 mu of fields daily. In Yichun and Fengcheng counties of Yichun region, 300,000 people were organized into 3,000 shock brigades to carry out a campaign of each person carrying 100 loads of water to irrigate the rice. Currently, the vast majority of the more than 4 million mu of drought-stricken double-cropping late rice in the province has been rescued, ensuring normal growth in the later stages.
    This year, the outbreak of insect pests in late rice occurred early, with high densities and rampant damage, representing the most severe occurrence in some areas in the past two or three decades. It is currently the peak period for "three-brood borers and four-brood borers." Building on the victory of the previous stage of pest control, all localities have reorganized their fighting forces and launched a general attack on pests using methods such as chemical spraying, light trapping, manual catching, and removing withered hearts. In the struggle against pests, many communes have established pesticide factories to produce various pesticides.
    In order to achieve "increased production in every plot and a bumper harvest in every field," all localities, while vigorously focusing on drought resistance and pest control, have also comprehensively arranged labor, and universally applied an additional topdressing of ear fertilizer based on the growth of the rice seedlings. Suichuan County proposed "Rice seedlings line up, skillfully apply ear fertilizer, strive for ten more grains per ear," and launched a campaign to increase production by one liang of grain per rice clump, with 150,000 people in the county launching a fierce attack on the ear fertilizer application stage for exceeding the late rice production target. Chengguan Commune in Chongren County organized a specialized team for accumulating and applying fertilizer with 50% of the labor force, applying an average of more than 26 dan of ear fertilizer per mu.
    To prevent lodging, many areas have inspected the well-growing rice seedlings and taken various effective measures. For example, applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as ash and bone meal; ditching and sun-drying the fields; removing dew from rice leaves to reduce the load on the rice heads; and for late rice that has already shown signs of lodging, using ropes to erect rice frames, etc.
    Through a series of measures, the 12 million mu of late rice throughout the province have now generally reached the stages of jointing, heading, and flowering, presenting a scene of bumper harvest.

### 奋战干旱　扑灭虫害  江西确保一千二百万亩晚稻超早稻

    奋战干旱　扑灭虫害
    江西确保一千二百万亩晚稻超早稻
    本报讯　为确保晚稻超过早稻，江西省各地人民公社正在为晚稻丰收掀起保株、保穗、保粒为中心的田间管理高潮。
    今年江西省一千二百万亩二季晚稻，由于贯彻执行了“八字宪法”，生长普遍好。但部分地区的旱、虫灾害给晚稻丰收带来很大的威胁。九江、宜春专区，旱象仍在发展。为保证晚稻灌足吐穗扬花水，各地抓住穗、粒关，集中主要力量，采取各项措施，千方百计与干旱作斗争。九江专区实行大兵团作战，组织了三十三万劳动大军挖河、筑坝、打井、淘溪、凿泉，出动十万多部水车、七十多台拖拉机、二百五十多台抽水机，每天灌田二十多万亩。宜春专区的宜春、丰城等县，三十万人组织成三千个突击队，开展了每人挑水一百担运动，担水淋禾。现在，全省四百多万亩受旱的二季晚稻，绝大部分得到了抢救，保证了后期的正常生长。
    今年晚稻虫害发生期早、密度大、危害猖狂，在一些地区是二三十年来最严重的一次。目前正是“三化螟、四化螟”的盛发时期。各地乘前一阶段灭虫斗争的胜利，再次整顿战斗队伍，采取药杀、灯诱、捕打、拔枯心等办法对害虫发起了总攻击。在灭虫斗争中，许多公社都办了农药厂，赶制各种农药。
    为了达到“丘丘增产、兜兜丰收”，各地在大力突击抗旱、灭虫的同时，又全面安排劳动力，根据禾苗生长情况普遍增施了一次穗肥。遂川县提出“禾苗排队，巧施穗肥，争取每穗多结十粒谷”，开展了一兜禾一两谷的增产运动，全县十五万大军为晚稻超产，猛攻穗肥关。崇仁县城关公社以50％的劳动力组织了积肥、施肥专业队，平均每亩施穗肥二十六担多。
    为防止倒伏，不少地区对生长良好的禾苗进行了检查和采取各项有效措施。例如加施草木灰、骨灰等磷钾肥；开沟晒田；赶禾叶露水以减轻禾头负重；已开始呈现倒伏的晚稻，拉绳搭禾架等。
    经过一系列措施，目前全省一千二百万亩晚稻已普遍圆秆拔节，齐穗扬花，呈现一片丰收景象。
