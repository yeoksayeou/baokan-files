Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 22nd: The "Three Autumns" work in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is progressing rapidly and well. Millions of people of all ethnic groups, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are brimming with enthusiasm, and a great leap forward situation is emerging in the countryside.

Since the launch of the battle for autumn fields in August and September under the call to oppose Rightism and boost morale, a vigorous production competition movement has been launched in the vast countryside to surpass summer grain with autumn grain and vow to win a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. As a result, the field management of autumn crops has been very good, resulting in a general bumper harvest of 15 million mu of autumn crops throughout the autonomous region. According to statistics, the rice yield reached over 500 jin per mu on more than 80,000 mu, over 700 jin on more than 2,400 mu, and over 1,000 jin on 633 mu of high-yield fields; the corn yield reached over 500 jin per mu on more than 2 million mu, over 700 jin on more than 23,300 mu, and over 1,000 jin on more than 2,830 mu. The 1.3 million mu of summer-sown crops throughout the autonomous region are also ripe and full, and the pre-frost cotton bolls have also increased unprecedentedly. According to trial threshing and estimation by the autonomous region's agricultural production departments, it is estimated that this year's 9 million mu of autumn grain will increase by about 20% compared to last year; the total cotton production will increase by 47.8% compared to last year; and the total oil crop production will also increase by more than 70% compared to last year.

On the autumn sowing front, a vigorous competition to surpass the planned autumn sowing is developing vigorously. At present, the task of sowing 11 million mu of winter wheat in the autonomous region has been basically completed, with an area expansion of 2 million mu compared to last year. Winter wheat sowing in various parts of northern Xinjiang, especially along the railway line, has been completed in greater quantity, faster, and better.

Due to the early completion of autumn harvesting and autumn sowing, a large-scale autumn cultivation upsurge is about to arrive. At present, local Party committees are seizing the current good situation and continuing to carry out various production increase and economy campaigns, determined to launch a production upsurge on the agricultural production front to strive for a greater leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st: Guizhou Province has achieved a bumper harvest of economic crops. By the beginning of October, the famous Guizhou flue-cured tobacco has harvested 1 million dan, equal to the total output of last year. The output of cotton, ramie, sugarcane, tea, and other crops has also increased significantly compared to last year. In Suiyang County, the main production area of ramie, the total yield of the first harvest alone is close to last year's total output. In the past, many people believed that cotton could not be grown in Guizhou, but now many cotton-producing counties have emerged throughout the province. For example, in Yinjiang and Sinan counties, the average yield per mu is expected to be over 70 jin of ginned cotton this year. Sugar beet is a new sugar crop introduced to Guizhou from other places, and it has achieved high yields again this year, with an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu.

    新疆粮棉油特大丰收
    种麦面积扩大二百万亩，秋耕高潮即将到来
    贵州经济作物全面增产
    据新华社乌鲁木齐22日电　新疆维吾尔自治区的三秋工作进展得又快又好，数百万各族农民在党的八届八中全会伟大号召下，干劲越鼓越足，农村中呈现了一片大跃进的大好形势。
    自从8、9两月各地在反右倾、鼓干劲的号召下大战秋田以来，广大农村中就掀起了轰轰烈烈的秋粮超夏粮，誓夺粮棉大丰收的超产竞赛运动，因而秋季作物的田间管理工作十分良好，使全自治区一千五百万亩秋田作物普遍获得了大丰收。据统计：水稻亩产达到五百斤以上的有八万多亩，七百斤以上的有两千四百多亩，千斤以上的丰产田有六百三十三亩；玉米亩产五百斤以上的达到二百多万亩，七百斤以上的有两万三千三百多亩，达到一千斤的有两千八百三十多亩。全自治区一百三十万亩夏播作物也都成熟饱满，棉花的霜前花也空前增加。自治区农业生产部门根据各地试打测算，估计今年九百多万亩秋粮，总产量将比去年增加20％左右；棉花总产量比去年将增加47.8％；油料作物总产量比去年也要增加70％多。
    在秋种战线上，一个轰轰烈烈的秋种超计划竞赛正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着。现在，全自治区一千一百万亩的冬麦播种任务已经基本完成，面积比去年扩大了两百万亩。北疆各地，特别是铁路沿线地区冬麦播种工作都完成的又多、又快、又好。
    由于秋收、秋种的提早完成，大规模的秋耕热潮即将到来。现在各地党委正抓紧当前大好形势，继续开展各种增产节约的竞赛活动，决心在农业生产战线上掀起一个争取更大跃进的生产高潮。
    据新华社贵阳21日电　贵州省经济作物大丰收。到10月上旬，驰名国内外的贵州烤烟已收获一百万担，等于去年全年产量。棉花、苎麻、甘蔗、茶叶等产量也比去年大大增加。麻的主要产区绥阳县，全县仅收的头道麻就接近去年的总产量。过去很多人认为贵州不能种棉花，现在全省却出现了许多产棉县。如印江、思南等县，今年每亩平均预计可收皮棉七十斤以上。甜菜是贵州新从外地引进的糖料作物，今年又获高产，每亩平均收三千斤。
