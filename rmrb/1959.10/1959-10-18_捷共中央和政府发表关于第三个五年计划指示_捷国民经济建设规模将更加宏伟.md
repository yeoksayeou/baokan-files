Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 17th: "Red Right Newspaper" published today the instructions of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government on the formulation of the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).

The instructions stipulate that the main task of Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan is to increase the total industrial output value by at least 50% by 1965 compared to 1960, of which the production of means of production will increase by about 60% and consumer goods will increase by about 30%. The machine-building industry will still be the main link in the national economy, and the output of this sector will increase by 72% during the five years. During the Five-Year Plan period, the metallurgical and chemical industries will be rapidly developed, and the widespread chemicalization of the national economy will be promoted by greatly increasing the output of the chemical industry.

The instructions stipulate that, compared with 1960—the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan, by 1965, Czechoslovakia's anthracite production will reach 35.5 million tons, an increase of 20%; lignite will increase to 73.2 million tons, an increase of 32%; electricity—37.7 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 56%; pig iron—7.6 million tons, an increase of 61%; steel—10.5 million tons, an increase of 54%; the equipment of the chemical industry will increase by 214%, the production of the building materials industry will increase by 204%, the output of agricultural machinery will increase by 80%, the output of plastics will increase by 226%, the output of man-made fibers will increase by 66%, and the output of chemical fertilizers will increase by approximately 100%.

In terms of agriculture, the instructions pointed out that in order to develop the national economy proportionally, it is necessary to greatly increase agricultural output and adopt advanced production methods in animal husbandry. Agricultural output will increase by at least 21% during the five years. In order to increase the yield per unit area of ​​crops, it is necessary to improve the soil, effectively use fertilizers, and improve agricultural technology.

The instructions stipulate that investment in the national economy during the Third Five-Year Plan will increase by 54% compared with the Second Five-Year Plan, or approximately equivalent to the sum of investments during the ten years from 1951 to 1960. During the five years, investment in industry will increase by about 80% compared with the Second Five-Year Plan period, most of which will be used to develop the metallurgical and chemical industries, and expand the fuel and power base. The instructions point out that the struggle to improve the efficiency of the national economy must become the main means of completing the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan. To this end, science and technology must be developed in an all-round way.

The instructions point out that the growth of production must be mainly achieved through increasing labor productivity, improving production technology and improving labor organization. The instructions stipulate that in 1965, labor productivity in industry will increase by at least 40% compared with 1960, and labor productivity in agriculture will increase by 50%.

The instructions stipulate a gradual shortening of the working week during the new Five-Year Plan period. The shortening of working hours must be guaranteed by actively increasing the labor productivity of enterprises.

In terms of improving people's living standards, the instructions stipulate that compared with 1960, national income will increase by more than 42% in 1965, and personal consumption will increase by 30%.

The achievements Czechoslovakia has made so far have placed it among the most advanced industrial countries in the world. Compared with pre-war levels, in 1960 (the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan), power generation will almost increase sixfold, coal production will be two and a half times higher, steel production will be three times higher, and machinery manufacturing will be almost five times higher. In the past ten years, Czechoslovakia's industrial production has increased by 11.7% annually, while the United States is 2.5%, the United Kingdom is 3.4%, and France is 6.6%. In 1958, Czechoslovakia's coal production per capita was 4,449 kilograms, while the United States was 2,142 kilograms and the United Kingdom was 4,243 kilograms.
