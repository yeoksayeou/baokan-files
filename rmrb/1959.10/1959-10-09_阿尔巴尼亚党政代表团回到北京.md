After listening to General Manager Li Yiqing's introduction on the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, the distinguished guests visited Blast Furnaces No. 1 and No. 2, and Open Hearth Furnace No. 1, which had just produced steel a few days ago. During the visit, Chairman Shehu shook hands with the workers from time to time, and cordially inquired about their work and study.

After visiting the blast furnace, Chairman Shehu addressed the workers gathered in the square. He said: "During our short stay in China, we have seen the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which proves the correctness of the general line formulated by Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people protect the general line like they protect their own eyes." He said that the Albanian people are as happy about China's achievements as they are about their own. Finally, Chairman Shehu shouted slogans such as "Long live the Communist Party of China," "Long live the friendship between Albania and China," and "Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

    7日下午贵宾们在武汉时由湖北省省长张体学陪同到武汉钢铁公司参观，受到武钢数百职工群众的夹道欢迎。贵宾们在听了李一清总经理关于武钢建设情况的介绍以后，参观了一号、二号高炉和日前才出钢的一号平炉。在参观中，谢胡主席不时地同工人们握手，亲切地询问他们工作和学习情况。
    在参观高炉以后，谢胡主席向聚集在广场上的职工讲了话。他说：“在中国逗留很短的时间里，我们看到了中国人民在中国共产党领导下取得了很大成就，证明了毛主席制订的总路线的正确，中国人民像保护眼睛一样的保卫总路线。”他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国的成就像对自己的成就一样感到高兴。最后，谢胡主席高呼“中国共产党万岁”、“阿中友谊万岁”、“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁”等口号，这时，全场职工以雷鸣般的掌声感谢贵宾的鼓励。
