Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 10th: Wei Gaohou, the famous young red banner bearer and milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, has made extraordinary achievements at the beginning of October. From October 5th to 8th, he completed the equivalent of four months and twenty-eight days' worth of work.

Wei Gaohou was recently selected as a delegate to attend the National "Meeting of Heroes," which gave him tremendous encouragement. At the end of September, he expressed his intention to further promote technological innovation and complete the equivalent of eight months' worth of work before October 12th as a gift to the upcoming National "Meeting of Heroes." After enjoying the National Day holiday, he started working on key technological innovations on October 5th. With the enthusiastic help of factory and workshop leaders and experienced workers, he implemented sixteen major technical innovation proposals within four days. The motor housing produced by the factory originally required seven processes, including forging, die-casting, milling, and drilling, taking forty-six minutes to produce one piece. After Wei Gaohou changed it to precision casting, it only took six minutes to produce one motor housing, completing the amount of work that originally took sixty-six days in just one day. With the help of experienced workers, Wei Gaohou also changed the production of automobile parts washers from manual operation to stamping, increasing efficiency by 180 times.

After implementing sixteen technical innovation proposals, based on the actual amount of work completed, Wei Gaohou completed the equivalent of four months and twenty-eight days' worth of work in the four days of October.

Since the beginning of this year, Wei Gaohou's leap forward speed has been astonishingly fast. Especially after he started a competitive race with the famous advanced producer Liao Shigang at the end of August, his leap forward pace has become even greater. From the end of August to the end of September, he implemented 131 technical innovation proposals, completing the equivalent of nine months' worth of work, saving the country 274,000 yuan and 24 tons of steel. Now, he has put forward an inspiring goal: to complete the equivalent of two years' worth of work in the fourth quarter. (Attached photo)

　　魏高厚迈开技术革新大步
    四天完成近五个月的工作量
    新华社重庆10日电　著名的青年红旗手、重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚，10月份一开头又作出了非凡的成绩。在10月5日到8日的四天中，他完成了相当于四个月零二十八天的工作量。
    魏高厚最近被评为出席全国“群英会”的代表，这给了他巨大的鼓舞。他在9月底表示，要进一步大搞技术革新，在10月12日以前完成相当于八个月的工作量，向即将召开的全国“群英会”献礼。他在愉快地度过国庆节假期之后，10月5日一上班，就针对生产关键革新技术。在厂和车间领导干部和老师傅们的热心帮助下，他在四天之内就实现了十六项重大技术革新建议。厂里生产的马达座，原来要经过锻胚件、烘压型、铣和钻孔等七道工序，生产一件要四十六分钟；经魏高厚把它改为用精密铸造法之后，生产一件马达座只要六分钟，一天就完成了原来要六十六天才能完成的工作量。魏高厚还在老师傅们的帮助下，把汽车零件垫圈的生产由手工操作改为冲压，效率提高了一百八十倍。
    魏高厚实现了十六项技术革新建议以后，按实际完成的工作量计算，他在10月份的四天中就完成了相当于四个月零二十八天的工作量。
    今年以来，魏高厚的跃进速度快得简直惊人。特别是8月底，他同著名的先进生产者廖世刚开展对手竞赛之后，跃进步伐越来越大，8月底到9月底，他实现了技术革新建议一百三十一项，完成了相当于九个月的工作量，为国家节约资金二十七万四千元，节约钢材二十四吨。现在，他又提出令人振奋的目标：要在第四季度中，完成相当于两年的工作量。（附图片）
