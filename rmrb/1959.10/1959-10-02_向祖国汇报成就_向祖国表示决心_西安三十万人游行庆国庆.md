People carried huge character banners, charts, models, and physical objects to report their great achievements of the past decade to the motherland.

Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Shaanxi Province, spoke at the celebration rally. He called on all the people to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the great spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, eliminate right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive valiantly to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year.

Leading the parade were 120,000 heroic workers. The employees of the newly built Xi'an Steel Plant participated in the parade carrying the good news that they had overfulfilled the September production target fifteen days ahead of schedule. Currently, 104 factories in the city have completed the September production tasks ahead of schedule. In the ranks of the mechanical factory workers, the most eye-catching were 1,062 "vanguards" who had already completed this year's workload and were working on tasks for 1960. The Zhang Dalin team from the Northwest Optical Instrument Factory completed 45 months of work in eight months and twenty days, and now they are working on tasks for 1962. The banners held high by the worker parade confidently expressed their determination to comprehensively overfulfill this year's production plan by 10%.

The commune members of the suburban people's communes used vegetables, corn, cotton, and grain to build huge colorful pagodas to demonstrate the first autumn harvest after the people's communes were established. Now, the people's communes have put forward new fighting slogans, and they are determined to ensure an increase of more than 10% in grain and vegetable production this year despite the severe threat of drought.

Students from various universities and colleges in Xi'an also participated in the parade today. Before liberation, Xi'an only had two universities and colleges with 1,500 students. Now, it has 22 universities and colleges with more than 30,000 university students. Scientific workers in Xi'an also participated in the parade.

    向祖国汇报成就　向祖国表示决心
    西安三十万人游行庆国庆
    据新华社西安1日电　西安市三十万人今天举行盛大集会和游行，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年。人们抬着巨幅字标、图表、模型和实物，向祖国汇报他们十年来的伟大成就。
    中共陕西省委书记、陕西省省长赵伯平在庆祝大会上讲话，他号召全体人民要更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会的伟大精神，把右倾反掉，把干劲鼓足，开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为在今年内完成第二个五年计划各项主要指标而英勇奋斗。
    走在游行队伍最前面的是十二万英勇的工人队伍。新建西安钢厂的职工们抬着提前十五天超额完成9月份生产任务的喜报参加了游行。现在全市提前完成9月份生产任务的工厂已经有一百零四个。在机械工厂的工人队伍里，最引人注目的是一千零六十二员闯将，他们早已完成了今年的工作量，正在做1960年的活。西北光学仪器厂张大林小组，一鼓作气在八个月零二十天中，完成了四十五个月的工作量，现在，他们在干1962年的工作。工人游行队伍高举着的标语牌上，满怀信心地表示了他们要超额10％全面完成今年的生产计划。
    郊区人民公社社员们，用蔬菜、玉米、棉花、谷子等实物扎结成巨幅彩塔，来表明人民公社化后的第一个秋季丰收。现在，各人民公社又提出了新的战斗口号，一定要在干旱的严重威胁下，保证今年粮食、蔬菜增产一成以上。
    西安市各高等学校的学生，今天也参加了游行。解放前西安市只有二所高等学校、一千五百名学生，现在已经拥有二十二所高等学校、三万多名大学生。西安市的科学工作者们也参加了游行，解放前西安没有什么科学研究事业，现在全市已经有六百一十八个科学研究机构，拥有五千多名科学工作者。
    游行的行列中还有民兵、居民和文艺、体育大队。浩浩荡荡的文艺大军载歌载舞，为伟大的节日增加了无限欢乐的气氛。
