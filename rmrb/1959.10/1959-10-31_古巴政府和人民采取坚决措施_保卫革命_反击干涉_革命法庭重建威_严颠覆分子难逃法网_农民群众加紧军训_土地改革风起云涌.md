Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Cuban government and people are continuing to take various measures to safeguard the revolution and counter foreign interference.

The Cuban cabinet decided on the evening of the 28th to restore the revolutionary courts to deal with crimes committed by civilians or soldiers that are considered counter-revolutionary in nature under the law. This decision is included in a bill to amend constitutional provisions approved by the cabinet in accordance with the Fundamental Law.

Major Guevara, leader of the Cuban Armed Forces, said in "Revolución" on the 29th, when talking about the restoration of the revolutionary courts: "When the Cuban revolutionary government closed these courts, it originally thought that the enemies and slanderers would stop their hostile and distorted propaganda against our country. However, this generous action did not receive the response it deserved, so it is necessary to restore the revolutionary courts." He emphasized: "Cuba cannot become another Guatemala. Experience has proved that the tolerance of the rulers of this brotherly country towards the agents who are trying to overthrow them is enough for us to learn from."

Guevara said that military training classes are now being organized in agricultural cooperatives, and farmers will soon have enough military knowledge to cope with emergencies. We will expand this military training to other parts of the countryside until all rural residents are able to use rifles when it is necessary to defend our national sovereignty.

The Cuban government continues to take measures to eliminate elements in Camagüey province related to the Matos counter-revolutionary rebellion group. The government arrested 38 soldiers involved in the rebellion conspiracy, replaced the leaders of the Camagüey Provincial Workers' Federation who colluded with Matos, engaged with Matos in conspiratorial activities, and launched malicious propaganda, deliberately damaging the prestige of loyal revolutionary leaders. Former provincial and municipal committee members who served Matos have been forced to resign; the leading bodies of the provincial and municipal branches of the "July 26th Movement" in Camagüey province have also been reorganized. It is announced that these institutions are related to the rebellion conspiracy.

At the same time, the Cuban public is increasingly protesting against the intrusion of planes from U.S. territory into Cuba for bombing and strafing, and demanding the execution of Matos and other treasonous conspirators. In Oriente province, grand mass rallies were held in the two cities of Baracoa and Nicaro to protest the air raids on Cuba, demand severe punishment for the conspirators, and express resolute support for the revolutionary government.

Cuba's land reform movement continues to be carried out nationwide. Since the promulgation of the Land Reform Law in May this year, the Cuban government has successively distributed considerable amounts of land to Cuban farmers in many provinces across the country. According to incomplete statistics, in Camagüey province in the southeastern part of the island nation, the Cuban authorities requisitioned more than 70,000 caballerías (one caballería is equal to 201.28 Chinese mu). In Havana province, more than 132 estates have been taken over, in Las Villas province 446 caballerías of land have been requisitioned, and in Oriente province 14 large estates with more than 3,000 caballerías of land have been taken over.

The Cuban National Land Reform Institute announced not long ago that it has printed 200,000 land certificates, ready to be issued to farmers who have received land. The National Land Reform Institute has divided the whole of Cuba into 27 agricultural zones to facilitate the implementation of national land reform. According to estimates by the Cuban National Land Reform Institute, by the end of this year, 30,000 caballerías of land in Oriente province will be distributed to farmers. In addition, it is reported that 40,000 households, or 200,000 farmers, in Camagüey province will receive land in a year.

A considerable amount of land in the large number of estates that have been requisitioned or taken over was originally controlled by U.S. monopoly capitalists. For example, of the more than 70,000 caballerías of land requisitioned in Camagüey province, more than 23,000 caballerías were occupied by U.S. monopoly organizations. The requisitioned King Ranch livestock farm is the largest livestock estate in Camagüey province.

In order to change the deformed development of Cuba's long-term colonial single-product economy, while carrying out land reform, the Cuban government has instructed the National Land Reform Institute to mobilize state funds to vigorously run cooperatives for planting various crops, as well as cooperatives for animal husbandry, credit, consumption, materials, and tools. In the past three months, Cuban government cooperatives have sprung up like mushrooms in all provinces of the country. It is announced that in Pinar del Río province alone, 20 agricultural economic cooperatives have been established, which plant 23 different crops including grains, corn, beans, and tobacco. The National Land Reform Institute also announced that a large number of rice seedlings cultivated by the cooperative will be harvested before this month, preparing for large-scale development of rice production. It is estimated that rice can be self-sufficient in three to five years, while in the past Cuba had to buy 40 million U.S. dollars worth of rice from the United States every year. Potato production will be able to supply the whole country next year.

Public figures from various countries have expressed their support for the just struggle of the Cuban people. Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, wrote a letter to the Cuban Workers' Confederation on the 28th, expressing great indignation at the heinous bombing of Cuba by planes from U.S. bases.

Saillant pointed out in his letter that the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing its 95 million members, extends its sincere respect to the Cuban people and workers who are fighting unitedly and resolutely, and expresses its support for their struggle to defend their national sovereignty and the revolutionary achievements they have gained.

Luis Corvalán, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Chile, said: "News from the United States published in Santiago newspapers confirms the following condemnation of the Cuban government: the planes that attacked Cuba came from U.S. territory."

The United Workers' Confederation of Chile and the Federation of Students of Chile will launch a movement to support Cuba. Luis Figueroa, organizational secretary of the Workers' United Confederation, said that a congress inviting labor leaders from all over Latin America will be convened soon, and the issue of international support for Cuba will be discussed first.

    古巴政府和人民采取坚决措施
    保卫革命　反击干涉
    革命法庭重建威  严颠覆分子难逃法网  农民群众加紧军训  土地改革风起云涌
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：古巴政府和人民为了保卫革命和反击外来干涉，继续采取了种种措施。
    古巴内阁28日晚决定恢复革命法庭，处理平民或军人犯下的被法律认为是反革命性质的罪行。这个决定包括在内阁根据根本法批准的一项修改宪法条文的法案里。
    古巴武装部队领导人格瓦拉少校29日在“革命报”上谈到恢复革命法庭时说：“古巴革命政府在关闭这些法庭的时候原以为，敌人和毁谤者会停止他们对我国所进行的仇视和歪曲的宣传。然而，这种宽大的行动并没有得到应有的回答，因此就有必要恢复革命法庭。”他强调指出：“古巴不可能成为另一个危地马拉，经验证明：这个兄弟国家的执政者对竭力要推翻他们的代理人的忍让，足以使我们引以为戒。”
    格瓦拉说，现在正在农业合作社中组织军事训练班，农民在短期内将具备足够的军事知识，从而有能力应付意外。我们将把这种军事训练扩大到农村的其他部分，直到整个农村的居民都能在需要保卫我国主权的时候使用步枪。
    古巴政府继续采取措施，清除卡马圭省同马托斯反革命叛乱集团有关的分子。政府逮捕了三十八名参与叛乱阴谋的军人，撤换了与马托斯有勾结的卡马圭省工人联合会的领导人，他们同马托斯一起进行阴谋活动，并展开恶意的宣传，故意损害忠诚的革命领袖的威信。为马托斯效劳的前省市委员已被迫辞职；卡马圭省“7月26日运动”省市的领导机构也进行了改组，据宣布，这些机构同叛乱阴谋有联系。
    同时，古巴公众日益激烈地抗议来自美国领土的飞机侵入古巴进行轰炸和扫射，并要求枪毙马托斯等叛国阴谋分子。在奥连特省，巴拉科阿和尼凯罗两个城市举行了盛大的群众集会，抗议空袭古巴，要求严惩阴谋分子并表示坚决支持革命政府。
    古巴的土地改革运动继续在全国范围内开展。自从今年5月颁布土地改革法以来，古巴政府已经先后在全国许多省份把相当大量的土地分配给古巴农民。据不完全统计，在这个岛国东南部的卡马圭省，古巴当局征用了七万多卡瓦耶里亚（一个卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点二八中国亩）的土地。在哈瓦那省，接管过一百三十二个庄园，在拉斯维利亚斯省征用了四百四十六卡瓦耶里亚的土地，在奥连特省接受过拥有三千多卡瓦耶里亚土地的十四家大庄园。
    古巴土地改革全国委员会不久以前宣布，已经印出二十万份土地证，准备颁发给得地的农民。土地改革全国委员会已经把全古巴划分为二十七个农业区，以便于开展全国性的土地改革工作。据古巴土地改革全国委员会估计，在今年年底以前，将要把奥连特省的三万卡瓦耶里亚的土地分配给农民。另外有消息说，卡马圭省的四万户即二十万农民将在一年以后得到土地。
    在被征用或接管了的大批庄园中，有相当大量的土地是原先控制在美国垄断资本家手里的。例如，在卡马圭省被征用的七万多卡瓦耶里亚土地中，就有二万三千多卡瓦耶里亚为美国垄断组织所占有。被征用的莱资金氏牧场就是卡马圭省最大的牧畜业庄园。
    为了改变长期以来古巴的殖民地单一经济的畸形发展，在进行土地改革的同时，古巴政府责成土地改革全国委员会调动国家的资金，大力举办种植多种作物的合作社以及牧畜、信贷、消费、物资、工具等合作社。最近三个月以来，古巴政府的合作社如雨后春笋般在全国各省兴办起来。据宣布，仅仅在比那尔德里奥一省，已经办起二十个农业经济合作社，这些合作社种植了包括谷类、玉米、豆子、烟草在内的二十三种不同的作物。土地改革全国委员会并且宣布，本月以前将收获合作社培植出来的大量稻秧，准备大规模发展大米生产。估计在三、五年后大米可以自给自足，而过去古巴每年要向美国购买四千万美元的大米。土豆生产明年就能供应全国。
    各国公众纷纷支持古巴人民的正义斗争。世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬28日写信给古巴工人联合会，对来自美国基地的飞机对古巴所进行的罪恶轰炸，表示极大的愤慨。
    赛扬在信中指出，世界工会联合会代表它的九千五百万会员，向正在团结一致地坚决斗争的古巴人民和工人，致以诚挚的敬意，并且对他们保卫自己国家的主权、保卫已获得的革命胜利果实的斗争表示支持。
    智利，共产党总书记路易斯·科尔巴兰说：“圣地亚哥报纸刊载的来自美国的消息证实了古巴政府的下列谴责：进攻古巴的飞机是来自美国的领土。”
    智利工人统一工会和智利学生联合会将展开声援古巴的运动。工人统一工会的组织书记路易斯·菲格罗亚表示，不久将召开一个邀请全拉丁美洲工人领袖参加的代表大会，并将首先讨论国际支援古巴的问题。
