Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: The "Capital Hanoi Newspaper" published a commentary today, condemning the United States and its followers for bringing the so-called "Tibet issue" to the United Nations at a time when the international atmosphere is tending towards relaxation.

The commentary pointed out that this is a violation of the United Nations Charter and an interference in China's internal affairs. The commentary said, "The United States and its appendages raised the so-called 'Tibet issue' in order to divert world public opinion from major international issues such as the Soviet disarmament proposal, hoping that world public opinion would ignore the United States' ongoing interference in Laos and South Vietnam."

The commentary concluded that no matter how the US imperialists and their group clamor, "Tibet is embarking on a bright road under the leadership of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 15th: The "Burma New Times" expressed its opposition to the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue" in an editorial published today.

The editorial welcomed Indonesia's attitude of opposing the UN General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue." The editorial believes that discussing the so-called "Tibet issue" will not only fail to promote peace but will also exacerbate tensions between East and West.

The English-language newspaper pointed out that "the United Nations should deal with issues whose purpose is solely to maintain or promote harmony and peace." The newspaper also said that the underlying motive for including the so-called "Tibet issue" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly is an attempt to "stir up" "hatred, misunderstanding, and tension" towards People's China.

　　不许干涉中国内政
    越缅两国报纸斥联大讨论“西藏问题”
    新华社河内16日电　此间“首都河内报”今天发表评论，谴责美国和它的追随者在目前国际气氛正趋于缓和的时候，把所谓“西藏问题”提到联合国。
    评论指出这是违背联合国宪章和干涉中国内政的行为。评论说，“美国及其附庸提出所谓‘西藏问题’是为了转移世界舆论对苏联裁军建议等重大国际问题的注意，希望世界舆论放过美国正在干涉老挝和南越的行为”。
    评论最后说，不论美帝国主义及其集团如何叫嚣，但是，“西藏在中华人民共和国中央政府的领导下，正在走上光明的道路”。
    新华社仰光15日电　“缅甸新时代报”在今天发表的社论中，表示反对联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    社论欢迎印度尼西亚反对联大讨论所谓“西藏问题”的态度。社论认为讨论所谓“西藏问题”不但不能促进和平，而且会加剧东西方之间的紧张关系。
    这家英文报纸指出，“联合国应当处理目的只在于维护或促进和谐与和平的问题。”这家报纸还说，把所谓“西藏问题”列入联合国大会议程的潜在动机是企图“煽起”对人民中国的“仇恨、误解和紧张局势”。（附图片）
