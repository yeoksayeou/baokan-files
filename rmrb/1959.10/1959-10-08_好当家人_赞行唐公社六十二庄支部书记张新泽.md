    Good Family Manager
    — In Praise of Zhang Xinze, Secretary of the Sixty-Two Village Branch of the Xingtang Commune
    Chen Jinxin, Secretary of the Xinle County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Zhang Xinze, the branch secretary of the Sixty-Two Village Production Team of the Xingtang People's Commune in Xinle County, Hebei, is praised by the commune members as a good family manager; the branch secretaries of the various production teams in the commune also unanimously recognize Xinze as a vigorous and confident good party member and good cadre.

    "Qicun, surpass it!"
    In the spring of this year, the Xingtang Commune Party Committee convened cadres from various production teams to convey the 1959 production leap forward plan. While Zhang Xinze was thinking about his team's production increase targets and measures, he was also thinking about the target for the competition. "Xinze, how about you compete with Qicun?" Secretary Hou of the commune said bluntly, and then added with a smile: "Do you have the courage?"
    Qicun is not only the best production team in the Xingtang Commune, but also famous throughout the county. Now that the secretary has named Sixty-Two Village to compete with Qicun, Zhang Xinze felt the weight of the burden, but he answered loudly: "Qicun, surpass it, I guarantee it to the Party!"
    The news quickly spread to every corner of Sixty-Two Village. Commune member Duan Luosheng said: "Xinze has always been reliable in his work, and everything he does pleases everyone. This time, choosing an opponent is a bit reckless." Duan Luozhu also said: "Qicun is less than a mile away, and it was a joint village commune in the advanced cooperative, everyone knows each other's details. They have sixty-four large mules and horses, while we only have thirty-three, and they are all small donkeys and skinny oxen, not even worth ten of theirs; their boiler has fourteen more horsepower than ours. In my opinion, competing with Qicun is just asking for trouble, it's better to find someone with poorer conditions." Some people said: "Whether we compete or not, let's not be fools; just produce according to three hundred and sixty jin."
    Zhang Xinze felt a little uneasy after hearing these reactions. Suddenly, he remembered what Deputy Secretary Li Zengqian of the Party Committee had said: Wang Guofan changed the poor outlook because he had ambition. He blamed himself for using a simple method, why didn't he first grasp the poor peasant backbone? With reliance, even a big "wind" can be withstood!
    The poor peasant backbone meeting was held. Zhang Xinze first talked about the purpose of the production increase competition, which is to improve production, increase social wealth, and benefit the country, the community, and oneself. Choosing Qicun as an opponent is in line with the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. If we choose a team that is inferior to ourselves to compete with, then what's the point? "It is a fact that Qicun's conditions are good," Xinze emphasized, "but in my opinion, the thinking of the commune members is more important than production conditions. The Wang Guofan Cooperative was a poor cooperative with three donkey legs, but it caught up with the production and living standards of prosperous middle peasants. We must learn from their spirit. If you are poor, you must have ambition, and with determination, you can change your outlook. Listening to the Party and implementing the ‘Eight-Character Charter’ for agriculture is a guarantee for increasing production." He then said to the poor peasant Baolin: "Baolin, don't you remember that your family had nothing to eat in the old society and was forced to sell the land to the landlord Duan Luoyin? He wrote a contract but didn't pay, only giving dried vegetables at a reduced price. After you sold the land, did you eat three hundred and sixty jin? I'm afraid you couldn't even eat two hundred jin a year! In 1957, our village was a grain-deficient village, and the state supplied 15,000 jin of grain. Where did that come from? Wasn't it from other places that increased production and sold more to the state? In 1958, there was a Great Leap Forward, and we changed from grain deficiency to surplus grain, selling more than 110,000 jin to the state. What, now that we have food, we're going to produce according to three hundred and sixty jin?! Workers don't produce grain, but where do our boilers for watering the fields and our foreign cloth come from? Besides, 'store grain against famine,' we don't even have reserves yet!..." Xinze spoke with tears in his eyes, and Baolin and Luoting also cried. Baolin wiped away his tears and said: "Xinze, don't say anymore, I will produce well and surpass Qicun."
    The poor peasants formed a backbone, the Party members and Youth League members took the lead, and they led the commune members to speak out and debate in groups. A fighting team with great ambitions was organized, and they must compete with Qicun!
    Qicun, of course, would not be willing to admit defeat. Time waits for no one, the wheat was turning green and jointing, and Qicun applied twenty jin of fertilizer per mu of wheat. The commune members of Sixty-Two Village saw this and quickly told Xinze. Xinze calmly said: "Not beyond our expectations, they are pressing on us. But they have fertilizer, and we don't have that condition. We have seventy-odd stoves and sixty-odd manure pens, eight carts of coarse manure per mu, and the energy is not necessarily less than twenty jin of fertilizer."
    No sooner said than done, the movement to dismantle stoves and clear manure pens was launched overnight. Xinze dismantled his own stove first. Not even bothering to wash his face, he wore a "Bao Gong face" and delivered manure as soon as it was dug up. The whole village worked hard for three days and two nights, and the wheat was universally fertilized once. When the wheat was flowering and filling, he thought again: Fertilizer, satiety, and water must be sufficient. He also led the masses to repair the canals and solve the problem of irrigation. The wheat successfully passed the five stages of turning green, jointing, flowering, filling, and harvesting.
    In 1958, Sixty-Two Village harvested forty point nine jin less wheat per mu than Qicun. In 1959, it harvested two point four jin more wheat per mu than Qicun. It surpassed Qicun! It won the red flag of the whole commune.
    As soon as the commune members saw Xinze, they smiled and said: "Our village's red flag was won by you." Xinze said: "No, this was won by everyone! As long as the heart is as firm as iron, it is not difficult to catch up with Qicun!"

    Day and Night
    At the meeting to report the good news of the wheat harvest and the summer grain purchase, the slogan "Learn from Sixty-Two Village, catch up with Sixty-Two Village, surpass Sixty-Two Village" was shouted loudly. Secretary Hou of the commune concluded by saying: "The advanced should guard against arrogance and rashness and strive for a full harvest throughout the year; the backward should whip the horses and catch up!" These words gave Zhang Xinze tremendous encouragement and strength.
    After the meeting, Zhang Xinze first went to Qicun to look at the autumn seedlings, and it was dark before he went home. He was really tired after attending a day's meeting and traveling a lot of roads, and he couldn't even eat. He lay on the bed, but his mind was still running: He had finally won the first battle in wheat, and he had to make a greater determination to strive for a full harvest throughout the year. The autumn fields in Qicun seemed to be stronger than those in Sixty-Two Village, so he had to come up with an idea quickly. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and was struggling to find a way. Suddenly, his mind lit up. "The masses are the most capable, without the masses, it is difficult to move forward." Right, why not consult with the masses, but bitterly sulk at home?
    He jumped up, immediately convened a meeting of old farmers. At the meeting, he said with a sad face: "I'm sick today, please come and help me cure my illness." Liu Luojin said: "You are strong and vigorous, what are you talking about?"
    "The corn and cotton are not as good as those grown in Qicun, that is the biggest illness!"
    Liu Luodeng said: "Apply more fertilizer, water more, and one dose of medicine will work." Everyone laughed.
    Now that there was a prescription, where would the fertilizer come from? Xinze walked along, thinking at the same time. When he walked to the door of Liu Qinghua's house, his heart moved: Qinghua had just returned from middle school for vacation, maybe he could think of some ideas. He went in to find Qinghua, who introduced the method of spraying superphosphate on cotton to increase production. It is true that many people have many ideas, and he happily went home. As soon as he entered the door, he saw the dried cabbage leaves rustling in the wind, and his mind suddenly turned to the cabbage. The cabbage had a bumper harvest this spring because it was fertilized with potassium-magnesium fertilizer, which grew nearly knee-high. They couldn't finish eating the fresh vegetables, and everyone was given fifteen jin of dried ones. Wouldn't it be better to apply potassium-magnesium fertilizer to cotton and corn?
    Now that he had a way, the question was how much money was there. He ran to the house of accountant Liu Luohuan to find out the details. There were still 3,500 yuan deposited in the credit cooperative. He also found several cadres such as Baolin and Fuqing, and together they studied the potential for buying fine fertilizer and digging coarse fertilizer, and arranged for labor and cadre division of labor, etc., and worked until dawn. Then, he called the supply and marketing cooperative, sent twenty-one large carts to pull potassium-magnesium fertilizer, and then went home. When his wife saw that he hadn't slept all night, she gently persuaded him to sleep in the morning, but he said that when the fine fertilizer was brought back, the fertilization technique would be an important issue, and he would have to personally train the technicians.
    That night, he went home three times, and he didn't sleep any of the three times. This is only one day and night that Xinze spent racking his brains to implement the Party's decision. How many such days and nights are there?

    Do it, do it first!
    Everyone praises Xinze's vigor. It is his job to ring the bell early every day, and after ringing the bell, he goes to the fields to take a look before going to work with the commune members. The masses gave him the nicknames "Always Energetic" and "Mud Pants" (because he walked in the dew-covered fields).
    When he talked about his experience in leading production, one important point was: "Thousands of leaders take the lead." If the leader doesn't personally participate in production, he can't lead others; if he doesn't personally participate in production, it is easy to make subjective decisions on contracting work; when engaging in competitions, he must personally get involved in the movement to lead the movement. Xinze and production captain Baolin also launched a competition, competing on who participated in more labor with better quality; and seeing who led the assigned squad well. Xinze not only worked hard himself, but his whole family was also "five-good" commune members. Under his leadership, the squad leaders and squad leaders, the feeders and feeders competed against each other.
    Xinze participates in production for an average of twenty days a month. In terms of time, it is not much, but if calculated by the amount of work, it is equivalent to twenty-eight point nine days. Because he has this vigor, the autumn crops in this village are comparable to those in Qicun. Some people praised and said: "He has a mouth that can discuss things with the masses; he has a pair of hands that set an example in leading production."

    Actively Run the Canteen Well
    Another experience of Zhang Xinze in leading production is, "Thousands of hearts and minds, we must care about the lives of the commune members."
    After the wheat harvest, the Party Committee put forward the policy of "actively consolidate, voluntarily participate, and run the canteen well." He discussed with Wang Jinlan, the director of the Women's Federation, and Song Laixi, the squad leader. Xinze talked about Wang Yukun's three poor peasant households resolutely running the cooperative. He said: "Wang Yukun has become the direction for 500 million farmers. Although the canteen and the cooperative are not the same thing, I think running the canteen is also a direction. Voluntary participation should not be understood as drifting and letting things go; active consolidation and voluntary participation are consistent, and the purpose is to run the canteen well."
    At the mass meeting, Zhang Xinze explained in detail the advantages of running the canteen; at the same time, he also explained that in the past, due to lack of experience, certain shortcomings had arisen. Duan Luoyun asked at the meeting: "Is it really voluntary?" Xinze said: "There is no ambiguity on this point." Luoyun then said: "If it is voluntary, you should not promote the advantages." Xinze then said: "I said clearly that in the past, we lacked experience and the management was not good, and there were some shortcomings, that is a fact; but we must never say that the canteen is not good. I think the canteen is very good because it facilitates production and is convenient for everyone." Administrator Gao poured cold water and said: "I quit the canteen, and I will be happy to drink cold water for three days." Poor peasant Erqiu said: "I will not quit the canteen, I will resolutely not quit." After this sharp ideological struggle, thirty-nine households of the ninety-nine household canteen wanted to quit. Xinze said: "The fact that thirty-nine households want to quit cannot shake the determination to run the canteen. A gust of wind cannot confuse the direction. The canteen must be run firmly."
    From then on, Xinze ate and lived in the canteen, studied improved measures, and the commune members democratically stipulated management systems and methods, and the canteen was further consolidated. Before long, Gao, who was "happy to drink cold water," really felt that cooking alone affected production, and found Xinze and apologized: "I was short-sighted and didn't listen to you, please forgive me." He returned to the canteen again. Now, eighty-eight households have joined the canteen, and the canteen is running very well.

    好当家人
    ——赞行唐公社六十二庄支部书记张新泽
    中共新乐县委书记　陈谨信
    河北新乐县行唐人民公社六十二庄生产队支部书记张新泽，是社员们异口同声称赞的好当家人；公社各个生产队的支部书记们，也一致公认新泽是一个朝气勃勃、充满信心的好党员、好干部。
    “齐村，赶过它！”
    今年春天，行唐公社党委召集各生产队的干部传达1959年的生产跃进计划。张新泽一面寻思着本队的增产指标和措施，一面又在寻思着对手赛的目标。“新泽，你们跟齐村竞赛怎么样？”公社侯书记直截了当地说，接着又笑着加了一句：“有勇气没有？”
    齐村，不仅在行唐公社是顶好的生产队，就是在全县也是闻名的。如今书记点名要六十二庄和齐村比赛，张新泽觉得出这副担子的份量，可是他响亮的回答着：“齐村，赶过它，向党作保证！”
    这个消息很快传到了六十二庄的各个角落里。社员段洛生说：“新泽这人办事一向有底码，办出来都合大家心意。这回选对手，可有点妄动。”段洛卓也说：“跟齐村远不过一里，高级社时又是一个联村社，各家底细谁不知道。人家六十四头大骡大马，咱这儿才三十三头，还都是小毛驴、牛腿子，还顶不上人家的十头；人家锅驼机又比咱多十四马力。我看，找齐村赛是自找没趣，不如找个条件差的。”有人则说：“赛不赛，不当傻瓜；按三百六十斤生产就行了。”
    张新泽听到了这些反映，心里有些不踏实。忽然，他想起了党委副书记李增谦说的话：王国藩就是有志气才改变了穷面貌。他埋怨自己方法简单，为啥不先抓住贫农骨干？有了依靠，刮多大的“风”也能顶得住呵！
    贫农骨干会召开了。张新泽先讲增产竞赛的目的，是为了提高生产，增加社会财富，利国利社又利自己。选齐村当对手，符合总路线鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，如果选不如自己的队比赛，那还有什么劲呢？“齐村条件好，是事实。”新泽又着重地说：“可依我看，社员的思想好比生产条件好还重要，王国藩社是三条驴腿的穷棒子社，赶上了富裕中农的生产和生活水平。咱们就得学习人家那种精神。穷，就得有志气，有决心，就能改变面貌。听党的话，执行农业‘八字宪法’就是增产的保证。”他又对贫农宝林说：“宝林，你不记得你家在旧社会没吃的，被迫把地卖给老财段洛寅，他立了文契不给钱，尽是给干菜折的价。你卖了地，吃上三百六十斤没有？怕连二百斤一年也吃不上吧！1957年咱村是缺粮村，国家净供应一万五千斤粮食，是哪来的？还不是别的地方增了产多卖给国家的。1958年来了个大跃进，咱才由缺粮变余粮，卖给国家十一万多斤。怎么，咱有了吃的就按三百六十斤生产啦！？工人不生产粮食，可是咱浇地的锅驼机、穿的洋布是哪来的？再说‘积谷防饥’，咱也没有储备呀！……”新泽边说边流泪，那边宝林、洛亭也哭出了声。宝林擦擦泪说：“新泽，你别说了，俺要好好生产，要赶过齐村。”
    贫农结成骨干，党团员带头，分头领导社员鸣放辩论。有着雄心大志的一支战斗队伍组织起来了，一定要和齐村展开对手赛！
    齐村，当然不会甘拜下风。节气不等人，小麦返青拔节了，齐村每亩小麦追了二十斤化肥。六十二庄的社员看到了，赶忙告诉新泽。新泽沉着地说：“不出咱的预料，人家逼上来了。可人家有化肥，咱没这条件。咱有七十多条炕，六十多圈粪，一亩八车粗肥，劲头不见得比二十斤化肥小。”
    说干就干，拆炕、清圈运动连夜展开，新泽先拆了自己的炕，脸也顾不上洗，带着“包公脸”，随砸随送。全庄人突击干了三天两夜，小麦普遍追肥一遍。小麦扬花灌浆了，他又想：肥饱水还要足。又带动群众整修渠道，解决了灌水的问题。小麦顺利的过了返青、拔节、扬花、灌浆、收打五关。
    1958年，六十二庄的小麦每亩比齐村少收四十点九斤。1959年，每亩小麦比齐村还多收二点四斤。超过齐村了！夺得了全公社的红旗。
    社员一见到新泽就笑着说：“咱村这面红旗是你争来的。”新泽说：“不，这是大伙争来的！只要心如铁石坚，赶上齐村有何难！”
    日日夜夜
    在小麦丰收报捷和夏粮征购会议上，“学六十二庄，赶六十二庄，超六十二庄”的口号提得真响亮。公社侯书记最后的结语是：“先进者戒骄戒躁，争取全年丰收；后进者快马加鞭，迎头赶上！”这些话都给了张新泽莫大的鼓舞和力量。
    散会以后，张新泽先到齐村把秋苗看了一遍，天黑才回家去。开了一天的会，又转游了不少路，身子着实累了，连饭也吃不下去。他躺在炕上，脑子可是不停的转着：小麦总算打赢了头一仗，争取全年丰收还得下更大的决心。齐村秋田看来要比六十二庄强，得赶紧打主意。他翻来复去睡不着，苦于找不到办法。忽然他的思想明亮了。“千能万能，群众最能，离开群众，寸步难行”。对，为什么不去找群众商议、却苦苦地闷在家里？
    他一骨碌跳了起来，马上召开老农座谈会。在会上他愁眉苦脸地说：“今天俺病了，请你们来帮俺治治病。”刘洛金说：“人强马壮，你说的哪里话？”
    “玉米、棉花都不及齐村长的好，就是心腹大病呵！”
    刘洛登说：“多追肥，多浇水，一服药见好。”说得大家哈哈大笑。
    药方有了，肥从何来？新泽一面走着，又一面想着。走到刘庆华的家门口，心中一动：庆华刚从中学放假回来，也许能想些办法。他进门就找庆华，庆华给介绍了棉花喷洒过磷酸钙能增产的办法。真是人多智广，他高兴地回家去。一进门，见风吹着晒干的白菜叶飒飒作响，他的思想猛又转到白菜上。今年春天白菜丰收是追了钾镁肥，长得近膝高，吃不完鲜菜，每人又分了十五斤晒的。棉花、玉米要追上钾镁肥不更好吗？
    办法有了，到底有多少钱还是个问号。他又跑到会计刘洛焕家里，摸清底细，还有三千五百元存在信用部里。他又找到宝林、傅青等几个干部，一起研究买细肥、挖粗肥潜力，安排劳力、干部分工等问题，一直忙到天亮。接着，又打电话问了供销部，派去二十一辆大车拉钾镁肥，然后才回了家。老伴见他一夜没睡，慢言细语地劝他清早睡一觉，他说一会儿细肥拉回来，施肥技术是个重要问题，还得亲自训练技术员去。
    这一夜，他三次回家，三次都没有睡觉。这仅是新泽为实现党的决议，夜以继日费尽心机的一个日夜。像这样的事情，又何止这样一个日夜呢？
    干，干在头里！
    提起新泽的干劲，人人称赞。每天早起打钟是他的事，打钟后先到地里看一趟，然后再和社员同去干活。群众给他起的外号叫“常精神”和“泥裤腿”（在露水地里趟的）。
    他谈到领导生产的经验，重要的一条是：“千头万头领导带头”。领导生产不亲自参加生产，就没法领导别人：不亲自参加生产，包工就容易定的主观；搞竞赛，更得亲身投入运动中去领导运动。新泽和生产队长宝林也开展对手赛，比赛谁参加劳动多，质量好；看谁把分工领导的小队领导好。新泽不仅自己干在头里，他全家也都是“五好”社员。在他带动下，小队长和小队长、饲养员和饲养员之间，都兵对兵、将对将的赛起来了。
    新泽平均一个月参加生产二十天，按时间说不多，但要按工活算就合二十八点九天。由于他有这股子干劲，这个村的秋田作物跟齐村不分高低了。有人夸奖地说：“他有口一张，遇事能和群众商量；他有手一双，带头生产是榜样。”
    积极办好食堂
    张新泽领导生产的另一条经验是，“千心万心，社员生活要关心。”
    麦收以后，党委提出“积极巩固、自愿参加、办好食堂”的方针，他同妇女会主任王金兰和小队长宋来喜开会商量。新泽讲起了王玉坤三户贫农坚决办合作社的事来。他说：“王玉坤成了五亿农民的方向。食堂和合作社虽不是一回事，我看办食堂也是个方向。自愿参加可别领会成是自流和放任不管；积极巩固和自愿参加是一致的，目的是为了办好食堂。”
    在群众会上，张新泽详细地讲了办食堂的优越性；同时也解释了过去因为没有经验，产生了某些缺点。段洛云在会上问：“是不是真自愿？”新泽说：“这一点不含糊。”洛云接着说：“是自愿，你就不要宣传优越性。”新泽接着说：“我说的明白，过去没经验，管理不好，有点缺点是事实；但绝不能说食堂不好。我看食堂好得很，因为它便利生产，方便大家。”管理员高为泼冷水地说：“我退出食堂，喝三天凉水也痛快。”贫农二秋说：“我不退出食堂，坚决不退。”经过这一场尖锐的思想斗争，九十九户的食堂有三十九户要退。新泽说：“三十九户要退，也动摇不了办食堂的决心，一阵风刮不迷方向。食堂坚决要办下去。”
    从此，新泽吃住在食堂，研究改进的措施，经社员民主规定管理制度和方法，食堂更加巩固了。没有隔多久，那个“喝凉水”也痛快的高为真感到单起火响影生产了，找到新泽抱歉地说：“我鼠目寸光，没听你的话，要原谅我。”他又回到食堂来了。现在，加入食堂的有八十八户，食堂办得很好。
