　　"Old Ox Cart" Transformed into "Thoroughbred Horse"
　　——Several Scenes of Factory Director Cui Shaowu Going Down to the Workshop to Work Alongside the Workers
　　Harbin Bearing Factory Worker Cai Yuqing
　　Our factory's forging workshop had been fighting a passive battle for more than half a year, consistently ranking as the "old ox cart" on the factory's competition charts. At the end of July, in the factory's "three-way combination" appraisal meeting, it was again rated as the worst. Representatives from brother workshops also raised concerns at the meeting, saying that our workshop's failure to supply forgings was affecting the completion of the factory's large-scale product variety plan, which was truly worrying and distressing. However, the production outlook in our workshop in August was significantly different, with output increasing by 70% compared to July, and the scrap rate decreasing by 70%. The former "old ox cart" had leaped into a "thoroughbred horse"! How were these achievements made? The Party's call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost enthusiasm encouraged us. Our workers' drive became increasingly strong, and the arrival of Factory Director Cui Shaowu to our workshop to lead the way in participating in labor further boosted everyone's morale.

　　It was a clear morning in late July when Director Cui came to our workshop once again to address the issue of our failure to meet the monthly plan and the high rate of scrap. This time he was even more disappointed, with only a few products piled up beside each machine and scrap accounting for half of them. Why was the output always low and the scrap rate high? There were many reasons. Take our No. 2 four-inch flat forging machine group, for example. Five out of the six members of the group were newly recruited apprentices who were not skilled enough. Some comrades did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of forging, believing that "blacksmithing" work was strenuous, had poor working conditions, and did not earn as much as others. The team's morale was low, and they did not put enough effort into their work. During operation, they would carelessly clamp or bump the forgings; the heated steel materials were not promptly cleared of oxide scale; and the workshop had not yet installed a crane, so the forged products were piled up in the trough and immersed in water, causing cracks. As a result, the amount of scrap increased. At that time, some people thought that even if it was scrap, it was still steel that could be reused after being re-smelted, so they did not pay enough attention to it in their minds. Moreover, everyone did not take good care of the equipment, sometimes forgetting to add oil or failing to conduct thorough inspections, so the machines often broke down. Each repair took half a day or a full day, so how could the output increase?

　　That day, Director Cui didn't say anything. He was probably thinking: these young lads are wasting so much steel, and secretly felt sorry for it! When he heard Director Zhuang of the workshop say that the workshop was short of manpower, he silently walked to our machine, picked up an iron shovel, stood in front of the red-hot steel material, and began to scrape off the oxide scale. It was a hot summer, and operating in front of the furnace, the director was soon drenched in sweat. He was much older than us, but he was even more energetic than us young lads. Everyone was very moved, and felt a surge of strength. The steel bars didn't feel heavy when we lifted them, and the furnace fire didn't feel hot anymore.

　　The news of Director Cui coming to work quickly spread throughout the workshop. Everyone rushed to our machine to see the director. After scraping oxide scale for a while, the director picked up a hook and took out the red-hot forgings (bearing races) one by one from under the machine, while counting for us: "...one hundred...two hundred...good, one thousand two hundred!" That morning, we completed the workload of a whole day in the past. Moreover, thanks to the director's timely removal of oxide scale from the steel material and hooking out the forgings, scrap caused by "oxide scale" and "water cracks" was avoided, pointing out the direction for eliminating scrap.

　　When working, the director didn't wear gloves or a towel. The workshop sent someone to bring them to him, but he refused to accept them, and said kindly: "Keep these labor protection supplies for the comrades, the comrades need them more than I do." These two short sentences made us feel the meticulous care of the leadership and appreciate the Party's excellent style of caring about the lives of the masses everywhere.

　　In the afternoon, Director Cui came to our machine again. Unexpectedly, he came to ask us for leave. He said: "I have to attend the Municipal Party Congress this afternoon and cannot participate in labor. First, I am here to ask you for leave, and second, I wish you a beautiful victory and set an example for everyone to learn from." The six comrades in our machine group were greatly encouraged and said in unison: "Director, don't worry, we guarantee to over fulfill the task." That day, on the premise of ensuring quality, we over fulfilled the plan by 20%. On the same day, the free forging Xu Xianghei group also completed 192% of the plan.

　　Early the next morning, Director Cui wrote a congratulatory letter to our group, which made everyone extremely excited! We immediately held a few-minute discussion meeting, and set the leap forward plan for the day, determined to guarantee 2,800 on the basis of ensuring quality, quantity, and safety, and strive for 3,000. Because everyone was happy and motivated, we broke the highest record of the four-inch flat forging machine that day, doing 3,043 pieces, reducing scrap by seven-eighths, and having no accidents. That afternoon, Director Cui came to our workshop again to hold a staff meeting, conveying the spirit of the Municipal Party Congress, and calling on everyone to launch a competition and go to Beijing to participate in the Heroes' Assembly with outstanding achievements. Everyone was even more motivated after hearing this, and were eager to try. All the comrades immediately plunged into the vigorous competition. In just a few days, a red flag workshop section (free forging) and eleven red flag groups emerged in the entire workshop.

　　After that, Director Cui came to our workshop to work almost every day. Because he had to work in the office and attend meetings during the day, he often took the time in the early morning and evening. He would come to the workshop at five o'clock in the morning, work all day, and then come to work in the evening, sometimes not leaving until eleven or twelve o'clock at night. While participating in labor, he also studied and solved key production issues with us, such as insufficient care for equipment, frequent machine repairs, long downtime, and inadequate adjustment of forces. In response to these situations, the workshop established a system and adjusted the forces, assigning adjustment workers to each shift. The director also organized cadres from the departments to come to our workshop to work alongside us and support us.

　　Our workshop has changed since then! Now everyone loves forging. Every day, everyone comes to the machine to prepare before work, and starts the machine as soon as they start working. When encountering machine repairs, everyone works together, you move parts, I turn screws, greatly shortening the repair time. The solidarity of the group has also been strengthened, everyone is of one mind, cooperates well, and works much faster. Recently, our group also used a day off to go to the Songhua River, where we played and exchanged production experiences. We are determined to respond to the Party's call, and we must exert even greater efforts and leap forward, leap forward again, and leap forward again.

　　“老牛车”变成“千里驹”
　　 ——崔绍武厂长下车间跟班劳动的几个片断
　　哈尔滨轴承厂工人　蔡玉清
    我们厂的锻工车间一连打了半年多的被动仗，在厂内竞赛图表上一直是“老牛车”。7月末在全厂的“三结合”评比会上，又被评了个倒数第一。评比会上兄弟车间的代表还提出意见，说是因为咱们生产的锻件供不上，影响到全厂大型产品品种计划没有完成，叫人听了真是又急又难受。可我们车间8月份的生产面貌却大不同了，产量比7月份提高了70％，废品率降低了70％，过去的“老牛车”一跃而变成了“千里驹”啦！这些成绩是怎样取得的呢？党的反右倾鼓干劲的号召鼓舞着我们，咱们工人的干劲愈来愈足，再加上崔绍武厂长来到咱们车间，带头参加劳动，使大家的情绪更加高涨。
    那是7月下旬一个晴朗的早晨，崔厂长为我们月月完不成计划、废品多的事，又一次来到了咱们车间。这一回又使他很失望，每台机器旁边都只堆了寥寥无几的产品，废品占了一半。为什么总是产量少、废品多呢？原因很多。就拿我们二号四寸平锻机小组来说，全组六个人中有五个是新招的徒工，技术不熟练。个别同志对锻工的意义还认识不足，认为干“铁匠”活费力大，劳动条件差，挣的钱不比别人多。大伙心不齐，干起活来就不够劲。操作时不熟练或者不小心，把锻件夹伤、碰伤；加热后的钢料不及时清除氧化皮；加上车间还没有安吊车，锻出的产品堆在槽里，被水浸泡产生了裂纹。这样，废品就多了。可是当时还有人认为反正废了也是钢材，回炉烧一烧还能用，思想上不重视。再是大家对设备也不够爱护，有时忘了加油，检查又不周到，所以机器常出事故，一检修就得半天一天，产量怎能上去呢？
    那天，崔厂长也没说啥，可能他在想：这帮小伙子又浪费这么多钢材，暗自心疼呢！当他听到车间庄主任说车间人手不够时，就不声不响地走到我们机台，拿起铁铲，站在烧得通红的钢料面前，动手刮起氧化皮来。那时正是炎热的夏天，又在炉前操作，不一会厂长就汗下如雨，混身湿透了。他年纪比我们大得多，但干劲比我们小伙子还足。大伙都很受感动，身上不知从那儿来了一股力量，钢棒抬着不觉得沉了，炉火再旺也不觉得热了。
    崔厂长来劳动的消息，马上轰动了全车间。所有的人都争先恐后地到我们机台来看望厂长。厂长刮了一会氧化皮，又拿起钩子把火红的锻件（轴承套圈）一个一个地从机器下面钩出来，一面还给我们报数：“……一百……二百了……好，一千二百了！”这天一上午就完成了过去一天的工作量。而且由于厂长及时刮除钢料氧化皮和钩出锻件，避免了因“氧化皮”和“水裂纹”而造成的废品，给我们指出了消灭废品的方向。
    在干活时厂长没带手套和毛巾，车间派人给送来了，他不肯接受，并且和蔼地说：“这些劳动保护用品留着给同志们用，同志们比我更需要。”短短两句话，使我们感受到领导上无微不至的关怀，亲切地体会到党的处处关心群众生活的优良作风。
    下午，崔厂长又来到了我们机台，真想不到，他向我们请假来了。他说：“下午我要去参加市党代会，不能参加劳动了，一来向你们请假，二来祝你们打个漂亮仗，做出个榜样，叫大家学学。”我们机台六个同志受到极大的鼓舞，异口同声地说：“厂长放心，我们保证超额完成任务。”那一天我们在保证质量的基础上，超额20％完成了计划。同一天自由锻徐相黑小组也完成了计划的192％。
    第二天一早，崔厂长就给我们小组写了贺信，大伙兴奋极啦！马上召开了几分钟的座谈会，订出了当天的跃进计划，决心在保质保量保安全的基础上，保证二千八百，力争三千。由于大伙儿心中愉快，劲头大，那一天竟打破了四寸平锻机的最高纪录，干了三千零四十三个，废品下降了八分之七，没出任何事故。当天下午崔厂长又来我们车间召开职工大会，传达了市党代表大会的精神，号召大家展开竞赛用出色的成绩上北京参加群英会。大家听了真是劲上加劲，个个磨拳擦掌，全体同志立即投入了轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动。没有几天的功夫，全车间出现了一个红旗工段（自由锻）、十一个红旗小组。
    以后，崔厂长就几乎天天到我们车间来劳动了。因为白天要办公、开会，就经常抽早、晚的时间。清早五点钟他就来车间，白天工作一天，晚上还要来劳动，有时深夜十一、二点还不走。他一面参加劳动，一面和我们一起研究、解决生产关键，如对设备爱护不够、机修多、停工时间长、调整力量跟不上等。车间针对这些情况订立了制度，调整了力量，每班配备了调整工。厂长还组织了科室的干部到我们车间跟班劳动来支援我们。
    我们车间从此变了样啦！现在个个都热爱锻工活。每天大家不等上班，就到机台来作好准备工作，一上班就开车。碰到机修，大家一齐动手，你搬零件，我扳螺丝，大大缩短了修理时间。小组的团结也加强了，大伙一齐心，配合协作好，干活快多了。最近我们小组还利用一个休息日到松花江边，一边玩，一边还交流了生产经验。我们坚决响应党的号召，一定要鼓足更大干劲，跃进跃进再跃进。
