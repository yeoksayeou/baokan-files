Comrades:

The rapidly developing situation of the national economy requires us to convene such a representative conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers. The tremendous development of China's socialist construction, the great improvement of the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, staff, and engineering and technical personnel, the wholehearted support of the people for the Party's General Line, and the emergence of more and more advanced collectives and advanced producers on various fronts. There are now 6,576 representatives attending this conference, representing nearly 300,000 advanced collectives and more than 3.6 million advanced producers in national industry, transportation, capital construction, commerce, finance, and banking. This is an unprecedentedly grand gathering of heroes.

Today, I will report to you on the current situation of economic construction and future tasks.

We are now in a new, vigorously developing mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy and a high tide of production and construction. This movement for increasing production and practicing economy and the high tide of production and construction were launched after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. It has the characteristics of being both vigorous and down-to-earth. This movement developed unusually rapidly, widely, and deeply. From the beginning of its launch to the formation of a nationwide high tide, it took only a short time to achieve great results in production. The output of many enterprises increased day by day, ten days by ten days, and then month by month. All workshops and almost all production teams in many enterprises overfulfilled the state plan, achieving an all-round red success. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces, autonomous regions, and thirteen cities, by mid-October, more than 230,000 young workers and more than 7,600 advanced collectives had completed their 1959 tasks and started their 1960 work. In this movement, all aspects of production leaped forward simultaneously. Many enterprises not only achieved high output but also achieved high quality, conservation of materials and labor, increased labor productivity, reduced costs, and safe production. This movement is also closely linked to technical innovation and technical revolution. In August and September alone, major industrial cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Taiyuan, and Xi'an put forward millions of technical innovation proposals, some of which have been implemented, and the rest are being tested and researched. As the movement advances, the communist cooperation between enterprises and departments has been greatly strengthened, and socialist labor emulation has been newly developed. The masses have created many lively forms of competition, such as pace-setter competitions, opponent competitions, hook-up competitions, one-dragon competitions, chain competitions, technical performance competitions, etc., truly achieving "pace-setters in sets, competitions in networks, and red flags in forests." From the perspective of enterprise management, the further implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, the further implementation of cadres participating in labor, workers participating in production management, and the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations, the combination of enterprise leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel have made the organization of production more meticulous than in the past, and problems can be solved in a timely manner. It is particularly worth mentioning that the broad masses of workers have shown a higher communist style than ever before in the movement: they do not pick light or heavy work, do not distinguish between easy and difficult, and go wherever there is heavy work or difficulties; they cooperate closely and help each other, putting the collective first and the individual second; they do not fear hardship and do not haggle over remuneration. This style truly demonstrates the true qualities of the Chinese working class.

With the development of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, both industrial production, transportation, and capital construction have seen a situation of daily and monthly increases in production, thereby creating the possibility of overfulfilling this year's plan.

In terms of industrial production. As of the end of September, the output of twenty-one important industrial products, such as pig iron, steel, electricity, crude oil, synthetic rubber, mining equipment, power generation equipment, power machinery, metal-cutting machine tools, freight cars, tractors, and grain combine harvesters, has exceeded the total output of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the first half of October, the average daily output of steel reached 47,600 tons, and the average daily output of coal reached more than 1.1 million tons. It is now expected that the various tasks of industrial production will be overfulfilled.

In terms of transportation. Regarding railway freight volume, 383 million tons have been completed from January to September; the average daily freight volume in the first half of October reached 1.62 million tons. It is now expected that the task of increasing railway freight volume by 36% this year can be overfulfilled. The planned increase in freight volume for automobiles and ships this year will also be overfulfilled. Due to the development of the mass movement, the volume of short-distance transportation will also be greatly increased this year.

In terms of capital construction. From January to September, investment of 17.388 billion yuan has been completed; 244 above-norm construction units, either fully or partially completed, have been put into production. From a sectoral perspective, the Ministry of Metallurgy, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power have completed more than 60% of their annual investment, with the Ministry of Metallurgy completing more than 90%. From a regional perspective, six provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Shanghai, Guangxi, Guizhou, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, have completed more than 80% of their annual investment. It is now expected that the planned state budgetary investment of 24.8 billion yuan for capital construction this year is likely to be completed. About 600 above-norm construction units can be completed or partially completed before the end of the year.

In terms of commerce. The domestic market has seen a new scene of prosperity, with more and more goods being supplied to the market; the supply of certain commodities that were once felt to be in short supply has greatly improved. Brisk buying and selling of goods, further replenishment of inventories, and increasingly active markets are the basic situation in commerce. It can be affirmed that this year's commodity supply can roughly adapt to social purchasing power; the commodity supply is guaranteed during the peak commercial season after autumn.

In terms of finance and banking. Due to the overfulfillment of the production plan, this year's fiscal revenue will overfulfill the plan, and the amount of bank deposits and loans will also increase significantly.

In addition to the above-mentioned situation, comrades must be concerned about the situation in agriculture. Although we have had natural disasters affecting more than 500 million mu, nearly one-third of the cultivated land area, we will still achieve a bumper harvest due to the consolidation of the people's communes and the further play of their advantages. Preliminary estimates indicate that this year's grain output will increase by about 10% compared to last year, and cotton output will increase by more than 10% compared to last year. With the increase in grain and cotton production and the great development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, this year's total agricultural output value will definitely increase by more than 10% compared to last year.

What does the above-mentioned situation illustrate? It shows that this year, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, China's national economy has achieved a continued leap forward through the efforts of the people of the whole country. This makes it increasingly clear that the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, has given us not just a leap forward in individual departments, but a leap forward in the entire national economy; not just a leap forward in individual years, but a continuous leap forward. It can now be completely affirmed that as long as we continue to implement the Party's General Line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, and further give play to the advantages of the people's communes, we will be able to achieve a continued leap forward in the national economy in the years to come. The great victory of the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957 has formed a political situation in our country that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and personally comfortable and lively. Now we should say that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 have formed an economic situation in our country that is both industrially and agriculturally developing, both centrally and locally economically developing, and both rapidly and proportionally leaping forward. This situation is the most fundamental thing in the current economic situation.

The reason why the Party's General Line for socialist construction can exert such great power is that it not only solves individual problems in China's socialist construction, but also solves the most universal and essential problems in China's socialist construction, that is, the problem of giving the fullest play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, the people, and only the people, are the creators of history. Now that we want to build socialism and wage war against nature, we should continue to rely on and give better play to the great power of the 650 million people and mobilize all positive factors. Because the socialist revolution on China's economic front (in terms of the ownership of the means of production), political front, and ideological front has achieved a decisive victory, the people have been thoroughly liberated and have unprecedentedly great enthusiasm. The Party's General Line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies are precisely the lines and policies that can most effectively and fully unleash the enthusiasm of China's 650 million people to accelerate socialist construction.

The biggest mistake of the right-leaning opportunists is that they greatly underestimated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, and even when the mass movement for socialist construction under the guidance of the Party's General Line had already been launched vigorously, they still attempted to suppress the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. They placed themselves in a position opposed to the Party's General Line, that is, in a position opposed to the broad masses, and therefore, they could not but be resolutely opposed by the Party and the masses.

When we say that China's national economy is continuing to leap forward, it does not mean that we no longer need to make arduous efforts. In order to thoroughly change China's poor and backward face and build China into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, the working class, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are faced with increasingly huge tasks of economic and cultural construction. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, while proposing to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, called on the people of the whole country to strive to catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and to strive to complete the requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program greatly ahead of schedule. To achieve such a glorious and great task requires us to strive for a continued leap forward in the national economy in the coming years, especially in 1960. That is to say, in 1960, we must also develop industry, agriculture, transportation, and other economic and cultural undertakings at a leap forward pace.

Can we make the national economy continue to leap forward in 1960? The answer is yes. In addition to the many favorable conditions and factors already in place, the slogan of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and the vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy launched under this slogan, provide favorable political and ideological conditions, as well as favorable material and technical conditions, for striving for a continued leap forward in the national economy next year. After this struggle against right-leaning tendencies, the broad masses of cadres and people have more deeply realized that the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, as well as the principle of implementing political command and following the mass line, are all created by combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's specific practice, and are completely correct. Therefore, they have more firm confidence in implementing the General Line and related policies. After the practice of 1958 and 1959, the broad masses of cadres and people have accumulated much experience in developing socialist construction at a high speed. In this struggle against right-leaning tendencies, the faces of the right-leaning opportunists were exposed, and right-leaning emotions, right-leaning thoughts, and right-leaning activities were criticized, overwhelming all evil winds and greatly promoting righteousness, greatly stimulating the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of cadres and people. It is precisely because the cadres and the masses have gone all out that all the original enterprises have further exerted their production potential, and many newly built enterprises have been put into production ahead of schedule, and the production capacity of our industrial and transportation enterprises in the fourth quarter will be much larger than in the first quarter. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on all fronts is continuing to advance rapidly. Our people's communes, after rectification, have been greatly consolidated and have embarked on a path of sound development, and will play an increasingly greater role in developing production.

In promoting the continued leap forward of the national economy, we must first ensure the leap forward of agriculture. Agriculture is of extreme importance in the national economy, and this has been increasingly proven by facts. Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, pointed out in "On Coalition Government," written near the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "The peasants are the main body of China's industrial market. Only they can supply the richest grain and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." After national liberation, after economic recovery and the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, it was further proved that agriculture is the foundation and basic condition for developing industry and the entire national economy. By the spring of 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the famous policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." He said: "Our country is a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80% of the national population. The development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture, so that industry has raw materials and markets, and it is possible to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." The simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is an important basic point of the Party's General Line for socialist construction.

We emphasize first guaranteeing the continued leap forward of agriculture, because with the leap forward of agriculture, there will be a leap forward in the entire national economy. The development of agriculture not only directly promotes the development of the light industry, but also promotes the development of heavy industry, transportation, other economic undertakings, and scientific and cultural undertakings. Not only that, the rapid advance of agriculture can better guarantee that the national economy can develop at a high speed and proportionally. Heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture are the most basic material production sectors, and maintaining appropriate proportions among them fundamentally solves the proportional relationship between the production of the means of production and the production of consumer goods. With a good resolution of the proportional relationship between the two major categories, we will be able to coordinate the relationship between national construction and people's lives, on the one hand, ensuring that people's lives are continuously improved, and on the other hand, ensuring that socialist expanded reproduction is carried out at a high speed.

After the people's communes were formed, our agriculture is already highly collectivized agriculture. However, the degree of mechanization is still very low, and the amount of chemical fertilizers applied is still small. To ensure the leap forward of agriculture, it is necessary to actively promote the technical transformation of agriculture and gradually realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture. That is to say, machines should gradually replace hand tools and animal-powered tools, mechanical power and electricity should gradually replace human and animal power, and the production of fertilizers manufactured by machines should be greatly increased. We should strive to spend about ten years, according to the different conditions in various regions, to systematically transfer China's agriculture from the current backward technology to the basis of modern technology, so as to greatly improve agricultural labor productivity and greatly reduce the labor force occupied by agriculture, so as to make agricultural production multiply and several times increase.

On the basis of the comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture, light industry production should be actively developed in 1960 to supply people with more necessities of life. It should be noted that with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives, the broad masses of people have put forward more demands for necessities of life, and our light industry production should strive to meet this demand. The development of light industry production must first rely on agriculture to provide a large amount of diverse raw materials, and at the same time, efforts should be made to expand the source of raw materials from heavy industry and other aspects, and gradually increase the proportion of raw materials in these aspects.

Supporting agricultural construction and promoting the development of agricultural production are increasingly important tasks for the industrial sector in the future. After the First Five-Year Plan and the massive construction in 1958 and 1959, the industrial support for agricultural strength has been strengthened. In the future, we should supply more light industrial products to the countryside, and should provide an increasing number of machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, fuels, electricity and building materials, to promote the technical transformation of agriculture. Supporting agriculture is an obligation that the industrial sector should undertake, and it is also a glorious obligation that the working class should undertake. All employees in the industrial sector should establish a positive view of serving agriculture. As mentioned above, promoting the development of agriculture will enable the industry itself to gain enormous development, and will make the worker-peasant alliance further consolidated. The decisive victory of the socialist revolution made the political alliance between the working class and the peasantry unprecedentedly consolidated; the great victory of socialist construction has greatly strengthened the economic alliance between the working class and the peasantry. In the future, to further consolidate and develop this alliance, an extremely important task is to provide more material and technical conditions for the technical transformation of agriculture, so that agricultural production can continue to leap forward, thereby greatly improving the lives of peasants.

In order to strongly support agricultural construction, and to meet the needs of the development of other sectors of the national economy, in 1960, the industrial front should, under the policy of steel as the key link and all-round leap forward, give full play to the potential strength of heavy industrial enterprises, and appropriately carry out new construction of heavy industry, so that heavy industry production continues to leap forward. We should make the development of the iron and steel industry, coal industry, electric power industry and machinery industry adapt to the requirements of the development of the national economy, especially the requirements of the technical transformation of agriculture. At the same time, we should actively strengthen the non-ferrous metals, chemical, petroleum, wood and other industrial sectors with great efforts, so that heavy industry can achieve comprehensive and more coordinated development.

The leap forward of industrial and agricultural production cannot be achieved without the cooperation of transportation, commerce and other departments, nor can it be achieved without the cooperation of financial and banking work. All these aspects should continue to leap forward in 1960. In transportation, we should further exploit the potential of existing equipment, strengthen the construction of railways and ports, increase new transportation equipment, and vigorously organize civilian transportation forces to develop short-distance transportation, so that transportation meets the needs of the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

I would like to emphasize here that as long as we resolutely implement the above-mentioned policies for developing the national economy, combine the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture, correctly handle the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and gradually eliminate the weak links within heavy industry, we can not only ensure the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960, but also create conditions for better leap forward in the years to come. It can now be completely affirmed that the development speed of China's Second Five-Year Plan will greatly exceed the development speed of the First Five-Year Plan.

To achieve a continued leap forward next year, we must first grasp the work of the fourth quarter of this year. We should carry out the struggle against right-leaning tendencies to the end, continue to boost the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees, and launch the movement to increase production and practice economy more widely and deeply, so as to better complete this year's tasks and prepare for next year's production and construction.

Employees on the industrial front must take various effective measures to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of this year's production plan. In order to cooperate with the large-scale water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, and to promote the leap forward of agricultural production next year, we should increase the production of more mechanical equipment, building materials and transportation vehicles.

Employees on the transportation front must give full play to the potential of existing equipment and ensure the needs of production and construction for transportation and communication. The railway, highway and waterway transportation departments should achieve fast loading and unloading, and closely cooperate with the mass short-distance transportation to complete the growing transportation tasks.

Employees on the capital construction front should universally promote fast and high-quality construction methods, accelerate the construction speed, ensure the quality of projects, quickly complete finishing projects, and strive to put more key projects into production as soon as possible.

Employees on the commercial front should do a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, strive to overfulfill the purchase tasks of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton and oil, and purchase all other marketable local specialties. We should strengthen and improve the supply of consumer goods for daily life, and actively organize the supply of raw materials and other means of production needed for industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, we should do a good job in transportation, allocation, storage and agricultural product processing.

Employees on the scientific and technological front should strive to complete this year's scientific and technological research plan, especially to seize the scientific and technological tasks to accelerate agricultural technology transformation and eliminate the weak links in the heavy industry sector, and solve problems that have important effects on current production and construction.

No matter which front the employees are on, no matter what kind of job they are in, at any time, they should complete their tasks comprehensively with more, faster, better and more economical results. The right-leaning opportunists said that if we achieved more and faster, we would not achieve better and more economical, which is obviously not true at all. Most of our enterprises and most of the employees have achieved both more and faster and better and more economical. The Beijing First Construction Engineering Company, with the help of more than 30 construction units, spent only more than 10 months to build the Great Hall of the People with an area of more than 170,000 square meters. As everyone can see, this is a very magnificent and spectacular building, which shows our Great Leap Forward and more, faster, better and more economical results. I will not list here one by one how the advanced collectives and advanced producers have completed the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the state with more, faster, better and more economical results. In fact, many of the representatives attending the conference today are examples of completing tasks comprehensively with more, faster, better and more economical results. We hope that some enterprises and employees who have not yet achieved both more and faster and better and more economical results should strive to catch up.

In production and construction, we should strive to eliminate the phenomenon of being loose at times and tight at times, and being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, so that the output rises evenly. We not only need to constantly make the production of this quarter higher than the production of the previous quarter, and the production of this month higher than the production of the previous month, but also need to constantly make the production of this ten days higher than the production of the previous ten days. In the past, the phenomenon of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, being loose at the beginning of the quarter and tight at the end of the quarter, and being loose at the beginning of the year and tight at the end of the year often occurred, which was mainly caused by human factors and was not an objective inevitability, so it can be completely changed. In August, September and October this year, the production of the vast majority of enterprises has been higher every ten days and higher every month. For example, the output of pig iron, steel and steel materials of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been like this from the beginning of August to now. In order to maintain the balanced rise of production, we should strengthen enterprise management, grasp the production preparation work at any time and place, carry out equipment maintenance in a planned and timely manner, pay attention to production safety, and at the same time, always pay attention to the organization and arrangement of the labor force, so that employees can carry out production in a combination of work and rest, and work and rest.

In order to continuously develop production and construction, we must constantly push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new upsurge. In this year's high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, several million examples of technical innovation and technical revolution have appeared on various economic fronts, which are extremely valuable, and at the same time, hundreds of thousands of technical innovation experts have appeared, which are especially valuable. For example, Wang Fengen of Shenyang Transformer Factory, Huang Rongchang of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Zhang Baifa of Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, Ma Xueli of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, Li Fuxiang of Shanghai Boiler Factory, Su Guangming of Harbin Vehicle Factory, Xu Chenglong of Qingdao Wood Integrated Processing Factory, Luo Muming of Shantou Machinery Factory and other comrades are all well-known technical innovation experts. The emergence of millions of technical innovation experts shows that our working class not only has soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, but also has infinite wisdom, and can not only work hard and practically, but also work skillfully. As long as we continue to emancipate our minds, use our brains, and work hard to study science and technology, we will be able to create more miracles.

The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement must, in accordance with the principles of letting go of the masses and experimenting with everything, actively improve equipment, improve operating methods, improve technology, improve product design, adopt new raw materials, materials and find substitutes, and implement the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual labor, in order to greatly improve labor productivity, improve product quality, and reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials. At the same time, we should strive to overcome cutting-edge technologies. Small and medium-sized enterprises with outdated equipment should of course carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and large enterprises with modern equipment should also carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. In technical innovation and technical revolution, we will adopt foreign methods if we can, and we will adopt indigenous methods if we cannot, or adopt semi-foreign and semi-indigenous methods to combine foreign and indigenous methods. Enterprise leaders should be good at proposing the goals and priorities of technical innovation and technical revolution according to the tasks and key points of production at various periods, submit them to the masses for extensive discussion, then concentrate the suggestions of the masses, analyze them, and resolutely implement and promote them after they have been proven effective through experiments.

In all industrial, transportation, capital construction, commercial, financial, and banking enterprises, we must extensively carry out the competition of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward. The widespread development of this kind of competition, solving the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and transforming the level of a few advanced people into the production level of the whole society, is an important method for us to improve production in socialist society. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the Industrial Advanced Producers Conference in 1956: "Production is always in a state of development and change, and new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Therefore, in any era, in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers will learn their technology and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the entire society, and social production is improved."

"One person's advancement is just a lone rider, and the advancement of the people can move mountains and overturn the sea." At present, there are many advanced producers and advanced production units who not only maintain their advancement, but also actively help the backward catch up with or exceed their level. Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory is an advanced production unit. In the competition with the same industry, it found that Pioneer Electric Machinery Factory had many difficulties in technology and raw material supply, so it took the initiative to mobilize its employees to provide assistance in many aspects, so that this factory also smoothly completed the state plan. Here, we can also cite Comrade Zhao Mengtao, a fine yarn female worker in Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory, who has comprehensively completed her tasks every month for seven years. Under her help, the members of the group have successively reached the advanced level, so that the whole group has overfulfilled the state plan for six consecutive years and become a model for the whole factory. She also tried her best to help workers in other groups catch up with the advanced. Under her influence, the competition movement of advanced helping the backward and the backward catching up with the advanced has been launched in the whole factory. This moving story of the advanced helping the backward is universally present, and it has become the most important feature of our competition movement, which shows the noble qualities of our working class. This kind of competition is completely a socialist comrade-style competition, which is completely different from capitalist competition. We hope that all advanced producers and advanced collectives in the country will continue to improve their communist consciousness, develop the communist style, maintain their advancement, and selflessly help others, so as to promote the great leap forward of socialist construction. At present, the new competition forms created by many regions, factories and mines, many of which play an important role in inspiring advanced elements and promoting and helping intermediate and backward elements, should be widely used in the future. The technical performance competition created by the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company plays a great role in universally improving the skills of workers and developing the communist spirit of mutual assistance, and it is worth promoting.

We should not only advocate the advanced helping the backward, and the close cooperation within an enterprise, but also advocate socialist large-scale cooperation between enterprises, between industries, and between production, transportation, and supply. Under the socialist system, the socialist economic foundation determines the fundamental consistency of the interests of individuals and collectives, and enterprises and enterprises, and therefore, it must and can be done completely consciously to support each other and cooperate closely. Since the Great Leap Forward, countless examples have vividly told us that the power generated by socialist large-scale cooperation is by no means equal to the simple sum of individual productive forces. It can not only greatly improve individual productive forces, but also create new and greater productive forces. We must greatly develop the communist style of obeying the whole, taking care of the overall situation, putting others first and ourselves last, and facilitating others. The cooperation between railways, highways, ports, factories and mines, the cooperation between production, supply and sales, and the related methods and systems, which have been gradually developed in the Great Leap Forward, should be adhered to and new methods should be constantly created.

In order to successfully undertake the growing construction tasks, all employees must study hard and constantly improve themselves. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The working class must transform the entire society in the class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself. The working class must constantly study in work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and can never stop." Not only new workers and young workers should study hard, but also old workers and advanced producers should study hard. The reason why many old workers and advanced producers can constantly innovate technology is that they have developed the spirit of seeking truth from facts, daring to think, daring to speak and daring to do, and can study hard and master production technology. To transform the objective world, we must first understand the objective world. We must not only work hard to study technology, but also work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to improve our political consciousness. Being both red and expert, and being both red and deeply expert, is the requirement for revolutionary intellectuals and technicians across the country, and it is also the requirement for workers and cadres across the country. Improving cultural level is the key to mastering technology, learning politics and learning theory. Every comrade should study culture hard according to his or her own different situation. All advanced producers should especially study humbly, continue to move forward on the basis of their existing achievements, and better play their leading role, backbone role and bridge role.

The situation we are in now is very good. Everywhere in our country, there is a thriving and prosperous atmosphere of striving for the top and thriving. Internationally, the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and the forces of peace and progress are increasingly significantly surpassing the forces of war and reaction. The economic and cultural undertakings of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union are developing rapidly. The socialist construction of the Chinese people is also increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people of the world. Our future is exceptionally bright, and we are full of confidence in future victories. Let us, the advanced producers and the broad masses of employees across the country, together with the people of the whole country, under the guidance of the Communist Party of China and our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, hold even higher the red banner of the general line of socialist construction, follow the victorious road of the Great Leap Forward opened up in 1958, and strive heroically for the new victory of the national economic leap forward this year, for the continued leap forward next year and in the years to come, for catching up with the level of the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and for rapidly building our country into a great socialist country with modern industries, modern agriculture and modern science and culture!

    国民经济迅速发展的形势，要求我们召开这样一个先进集体和先进生产者的代表大会。我国社会主义建设事业的巨大发展，广大工人、职员和工程技术人员共产主义觉悟的很大提高，人民群众对于党的总路线全心全意的拥护，在各个战线上涌现出愈来愈多的先进集体和先进生产者。现在参加这次大会的代表，共有六千五百七十六人，代表着全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、商业、财政、金融等部门将近三十万个先进集体和三百六十多万名先进生产者。这是一次空前盛大的群英会。
    我今天向同志们报告当前经济建设的情况和今后的任务。
    我们现在正处在一个新的蓬勃发展的群众性的增产节约运动和生产建设高潮中。这个增产节约运动和生产建设高潮，是在党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展群众性的增产节约运动号召以后开展起来的，它有着既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的特点。这次运动开展得异常迅速、广泛而深入，从开始发动到全国性高潮的形成，经过短短的时间，就在生产上收到巨大的效果，许多企业的产量一天比一天高，一旬比一旬高，然后是一月比一月高；许多企业的所有车间和几乎全部生产小组都超额完成国家计划，做到了满堂红。据十七个省、自治区和十三个市的不完全统计，到10月中旬，已有二十三万多名青年职工和七千六百多个先进集体完成了1959年的任务，开始了1960年的工作。在这次运动中，生产的各个方面是同时跃进的，许多企业不仅做到了高产，而且做到了优质，做到了物资和劳动力的节约、劳动生产率的提高和成本的降低、以及生产的安全。这个运动又是同技术革新和技术革命密切结合着的，只是8、9两月，北京、上海、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、武汉、重庆、太原、西安等主要工业城市提出的技术革新建议就有几百万件，其中一部分已经付诸实施，其余的也正在试验和研究。随着运动的前进，企业之间、部门之间的共产主义协作有了很大的加强，社会主义劳动竞赛有了新的发展，群众创造了许多生动活泼的竞赛形式，如标兵赛、对手赛、挂钩赛、一条龙赛、连环赛、技术表演赛，等等，真正是“标兵成套，竞赛成网，红旗成林”。从企业管理工作来说，由于进一步贯彻执行了党委领导下的厂长负责制，进一步贯彻执行了干部参加劳动，工人参加生产管理，改革不合理的规章制度，企业领导干部、工人和工程技术人员三方面互相结合这些办法，就使生产的组织工作比过去更加细致，使问题能及时地得到解决。特别值得提出的是，广大职工在运动中，表现了比以往更高的共产主义风格：干活不挑轻重，不分难易，那里有重活，那里有困难，就到那里去；密切协作，互相帮助，先顾集体，后顾个人；不辞劳苦，不斤斤计较报酬。这种风格，真正表现了中国工人阶级的本色。
    随着增产节约的群众运动的发展，无论工业生产、交通运输和基本建设方面，都出现了生产日日上升、月月上升的形势，从而也就出现了超额完成今年计划的可能性。
    工业生产方面。到9月底止，生铁、钢、电、原油、合成橡胶、矿山设备、发电设备、动力机械、金属切削机床、货车、拖拉机、谷物联合收割机等二十一种重要工业产品的产量，已经超过了大跃进的1958年全年的产量。在10月上半月，钢的平均日产量达到了四万七千六百吨，煤的平均日产量达到了一百一十万吨以上。现在预计，工业生产的各项任务都将超额完成。
    交通运输方面。就铁路货运量的情况来说，1月到9月已经完成了三亿八千三百万吨；10月上半月的平均日运量达到了一百六十二万吨。现在预计，今年铁路货运量增长36％的任务是可以超额完成的。今年汽车和轮船的货运量的增长计划，也将超额完成。由于群众运动的开展，今年短途运输量也将得到巨大的增长。
    基本建设方面。1月到9月，投资已经完成了一百七十三亿八千万元；投入生产的全部建成或部分建成的限额以上建设单位有二百四十四个。从部门看，冶金部、第一机械部、石油部、建筑工程部、铁道部、水利电力部等，已经完成全年投资额60％以上，其中冶金部已经完成90％以上。从地区看，河北、上海、广西、贵州、青海、新疆等六个省、市、自治区，已经完成全年投资额的80％以上。现在预计，今年通过国家预算的基本建设投资二百四十八亿元的计划，是有可能完成的。限额以上的建设单位，在年底以前可以完工或部分完工的将达到六百个左右。
    商业方面。国内市场已经出现一片新的繁荣景象，市场上的商品供应愈来愈多；一度感到供应不足的某几种商品，供应情况已经有了很大的好转。商品购销两旺，库存进一步充实，市场日益活跃，这就是商业方面的基本情况。可以肯定，今年商品供应是能够同社会购买力大体上相适应的；秋后商业的旺季，商品供应是有保证的。
    财政、金融方面。由于生产计划的超额完成，今年财政收入将超额完成计划，银行存款和放款的数量也将有很大的增长。
    除了上面所说的情况以外，同志们一定关心农业方面的情况。我们今年虽然有五亿几千万亩、即将近三分之一的耕地面积遭受了自然灾害，但是由于人民公社的巩固和进一步发挥了它的优越性，我们将仍然取得丰收。初步预计，今年的粮食将比去年增产10％左右，棉花将比去年增产10％以上。在粮棉增产和农、林、牧、副、渔各业巨大发展的情况下，今年的农业总产值肯定可以比去年增长10％以上。
    上面所说的情况说明了什么呢？它说明了今年我国的国民经济在去年大跃进的基础上，经过全国人民的努力，争取了继续跃进。这就使人们愈来愈看得清楚，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，给予我们的并不是个别部门的跃进，而是整个国民经济的跃进；也不是个别年份的跃进，而是连续不断的跃进。现在完全可以肯定，只要我们继续贯彻执行党的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，我们就能够在以后年份取得国民经济的继续跃进。1957年全民整风运动和反右派斗争的伟大胜利，在我国形成了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。现在我们应当说，1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，在我国形成了又有工业大发展又有农业大发展，又有中央经济事业大发展又有地方经济事业大发展，又有高速度又有按比例的全面跃进的经济局面。这种局面，就是当前经济形势中最基本的东西。
    党的社会主义建设总路线所以能够发挥出如此巨大的力量，是因为它不只是解决了我国社会主义建设中的个别问题，而是解决了我国社会主义建设中的最普遍和最本质的问题，即最充分地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性的问题。从马克思列宁主义的观点来看，人民群众，也只有人民群众，才是历史的创造者。现在我们要建设社会主义，向自然界开战，就应当继续地更好地依靠和发挥六亿五千多万人民群众的伟大力量，调动一切积极因素。由于我国经济战线（生产资料所有制方面的）、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经取得决定性的胜利，人民群众得到了彻底的解放，也就具有从来没有过的巨大的积极性。党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，恰恰是能够最有效地和最充分地发挥我国六亿五千多万人民群众的积极性来加速社会主义建设的路线和方针。
    右倾机会主义分子的最大的错误，在于他们大大低估了广大人民群众的积极性，而且在党的总路线的指导下，社会主义建设的群众运动已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来的时候，还企图压制广大人民群众的积极性。他们使自己站在同党的总路线对立的地位，也就是站在同广大群众对立的地位，因此，他们也就不能不受到党和人民群众的坚决反对。
    我们说我国的国民经济正在继续跃进，这并不是说，我们不需要再进行艰苦的努力。为了彻底地改变我国贫穷和落后的面貌，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，在工人阶级、农民和革命知识分子的面前摆着愈来愈巨大的经济建设和文化建设的任务。党的八届八中全会在提出今年提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标的同时，号召全国人民争取在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，并且争取大大提前完成全国农业发展纲要规定的要求。实现这样的光荣而伟大的任务，需要我们争取在今后年份首先是1960年国民经济的继续跃进。这就是说，在1960年我们还要以跃进的速度来发展工业、农业、交通运输业及其他经济事业和文化事业。
    我们能不能够使1960年的国民经济继续跃进呢？回答是肯定的。除了原有的许多有利条件和有利因素以外，党的八届八中全会提出的反右倾、鼓干劲的口号和在这个口号下开展起来的轰轰烈烈的群众增产节约运动，为努力争取明年国民经济的继续跃进，提供了政治的思想的有利条件，也提供了物质的技术的有利条件。广大的干部和群众经过这次反对右倾的斗争，更加深刻地体会到党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，以及实行政治挂帅和走群众路线的原则，都是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国的具体实践相结合而创造出来的，是完全正确的。因此，他们对于贯彻执行总路线和有关的方针具有更加坚强的信心。经过1958年和1959年的实践，广大的干部和群众对于高速度发展社会主义建设事业已经积累了许多经验。在这次反右倾的斗争中，揭露了右倾机会主义分子的面目，批判了右倾情绪、右倾思想和右倾活动，压倒了一切歪风邪气，从而大大地发扬了正气，大大地激发了广大的干部和群众的政治热情和生产积极性。正是由于干部和群众鼓足了干劲，使所有的原有企业进一步发挥了生产潜力，使许多新建企业提前投入了生产，我们的工业企业和运输企业在第四季度达到的生产能力将比第一季度大得多。各个战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动正在继续猛进。我们的人民公社经过整顿，已经大大地巩固起来，走上了健全发展的道路，对于发展生产将愈来愈发挥更大的作用。
    在促进国民经济继续跃进中，我们必须首先保证农业的跃进。农业在国民经济中具有极端的重要性，关于这一点，已经愈来愈被事实所证明了。我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在抗日战争将要胜利的时候所写的“论联合政府”中就指出：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”全国解放以后，经过经济恢复工作和第一个五年计划的建设，更加证明了农业是发展工业以及整个国民经济的基础和基本条件。到1957年春天，毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中，提出了有名的发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举的方针。他说：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”工业和农业同时并举，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的一个重要的基本点。
    我们强调首先保证农业的继续跃进，是因为有了农业的跃进，就会有整个国民经济的跃进。农业的发展不仅直接促进轻工业的发展，而且促进重工业、交通运输业和其他经济事业及科学文化事业的发展。不只这样，农业的迅速前进，就能够更好地保证国民经济既能够高速度地发展，又能够按比例地发展。重工业、轻工业、农业是最基本的物质生产部门，它们之间保持适当的比例，也就从根本上解决了生产资料生产和消费资料生产两大部类的比例关系。两大部类的比例关系解决得好，我们也就能够使国家建设和人民生活的关系互相协调，一方面保证人民生活得到不断的提高，另一方面保证社会主义扩大再生产得到高速度的进行。
    在人民公社化以后，我们的农业已经是高度集体化的农业。但是，机械化的程度还很低，施用的化肥还很少。要保证农业的跃进，就必须积极地推进农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化。就是说，要用机器去逐步代替手工工具和畜力工具，用机械动力和电力去逐步代替人力和畜力，并且大大地增产用机械制造的肥料。我们应当争取用十年左右的时间，根据各个地区的不同情况，有计划地把我国的农业从目前的落后技术基本上转移到现代化技术的基础上来，在大大地提高农业劳动生产率、大大地减少农业所占用的劳动力的条件下，使农业生产成倍地、几倍地增长起来。
    在农业全面地、迅速地发展的基础上，1960年应当积极发展轻工业的生产，以供应人民更多的生活必需品。应当看到，随着工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善，广大人民对于生活必需品提出了更多的要求，我们的轻工业生产应当努力去适应这种要求。轻工业生产的发展，首先要依靠农业提供大量的多种多样的原料，同时应当从重工业方面和其他方面努力扩大原料的来源，逐步地提高这些方面的原料的比重。
    支援农业建设，促进农业生产的发展，是工业部门在今后时期愈来愈重要的任务。经过第一个五年计划和1958年、1959年的巨大建设，工业支援农业的力量已经加强起来。在今后，我们应当供应农村更多的轻工业品，而且应当提供日益增多的机械、肥料、农药、燃料、电力和建筑材料，促进农业的技术改造。支援农业，这是工业部门应当承担的义务，也是工人阶级应当承担的光荣的义务。工业部门的全体职工应当树立起积极为农业服务的观点。如上面所说的，促进农业的发展，也就能够使工业本身得到巨大的发展，而且将使工农联盟得到进一步的巩固。社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，使工人阶级和农民在政治上的联盟空前地巩固起来了；社会主义建设事业的伟大胜利，使工人阶级和农民在经济上的联盟大大地加强了。今后进一步巩固和发展这种联盟，一项极为重要的任务就是要为农业的技术改造提供更多的物质技术条件，使农业生产得到不断的跃进，从而大大地改善农民的生活。
    为了有力地支援农业建设，并且适应国民经济其他部门发展的需要，1960年工业战线上应当在以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针下，充分发挥重工业企业的潜在力量，适当进行重工业的新建设，使重工业生产继续跃进。我们应当使钢铁工业、煤炭工业、电力工业和机械工业的发展，同国民经济发展的要求特别是农业技术改造的要求相适应。同时，应当积极地用大力加强有色金属、化学、石油、木材等工业部门，使重工业得到全面的和更加协调的发展。
    工农业生产的跃进，不能没有交通运输业、商业等部门的配合，也不能没有财政和金融等工作的配合。所有这些方面，在1960年都应当继续跃进。运输方面，应当进一步发挥原有设备的潜力，加强铁路和港口的建设，增加新的运输设备，同时大力组织民间的运输力量，发展短途运输，使运输适应于工农业生产跃进的需要。
    我在这里要着重地指出，只要我们坚决贯彻执行上述发展国民经济的方针，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合起来，正确地处理农业、轻工业、重工业各部门之间的关系，逐步地消除重工业内部的薄弱环节，不仅可以保证1960年国民经济的继续跃进，而且可以为以后年份更好的跃进创造条件。现在完全可以肯定，我国第二个五年国民经济的发展速度，将大大地超过第一个五年的发展速度。
    要取得明年的继续跃进，首先要抓紧今年第四季度的工作，我们应当把反对右倾的斗争进行到底，继续鼓足广大职工的革命干劲，把增产节约运动更加广泛、更加深入地开展起来，更好地完成今年的任务，并且为明年的生产建设做好准备。
    工业战线上的职工，必须采取各种有效的措施，保证全面地超额完成今年的生产计划。为了配合今冬明春的大规模的水利建设运动，促进明年农业生产的跃进，应当增产更多的机械设备、建筑材料和运输工具。
    交通运输战线上的职工，必须充分发挥现有各种设备的潜力，保证生产建设对运输和通讯的需要。铁路、公路和水路各运输部门，要做到快装快卸，并且同群众性的短途运输密切配合，完成日益增长的运输任务。
    基本建设战线上的职工，要普遍地推广快速、优质的施工方法，加快建设速度，保证工程质量，迅速完成收尾工程，争取更多的重点工程提早投入生产。
    商业战线上的职工，要做好农副产品的收购工作，争取超额完成粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品的收购任务，并且把其他一切可以收购的土特产品统统收购起来。要加强和改进生活消费品的供应工作，积极组织工农业生产所需要的原材料和其他生产资料的供应。同时，要做好运输、调拨、保管和农产品加工的工作。
    科学技术战线上的职工，要努力完成今年的科学技术研究计划，特别是抓紧为加速农业技术改造、消除重工业部门的薄弱环节方面的科学技术任务，解决对当前生产建设有重要作用的问题。
    无论是哪个战线上的职工，无论站在什么样的工作岗位，在任何时候，都应当又多又快又好又省全面地完成自己的任务。右倾机会主义分子说我们做到了多快就没有好省，显然完全不是事实。我们大多数的企业和大部分的职工既做到了多快又做到了好省。北京市第一建筑工程公司，在三十多个建筑施工单位的协助下，只花了十个多月的时间，建成了十七万多平方米面积的人民大会堂。大家看到，这是一座很宏伟、很壮丽的建筑，是表现了我们的大跃进和多快好省的建筑。我在这里不一一列举哪些先进集体和先进生产者怎样多快好省地完成了党和国家交给的任务，事实上，今天出席大会的代表，许多是多快好省全面地完成任务的榜样。我们希望，现在有些企业和职工还没有做到既多快又好省的，应当努力赶上去。
    在生产和建设中，我们应当努力消除时松时紧、前松后紧的现象，使产量均衡地上升。我们不只是要经常地做到这一季度的生产高于上一季度的生产，这一个月的生产高于上一个月的生产，而且要经常地做到这一旬的生产高于上一旬的生产。过去时常发生月初松月末紧、季初松季末紧、年初松年末紧的现象，主要是人为的因素造成的，并不是什么客观必然性，因而是完全可以改变的。今年8、9、10月间，绝大多数企业的生产，都做到了一旬比一旬高，一月比一月高。像鞍山钢铁公司的生铁、钢、钢材的产量，从8月上旬到现在都是这样。为了保持生产的均衡上升，应当加强企业的管理，随时随地抓紧生产准备工作，有计划地和及时地进行设备的检修，注意生产的安全，同时经常注意劳动力的组织和安排，使职工有劳有逸、劳逸结合地进行生产。
    为了不断地发展生产和建设，必须把技术革新和技术革命运动不断地推向新的高涨。在今年的增产节约高潮中，各个经济战线上出现了几百万件的技术革新和技术革命的事例，这是极其宝贵的，同时出现了几十万名技术革新的能手，这是尤其值得宝贵的。像沈阳变压器厂的王凤恩、重庆钢铁公司的黄荣昌、北京第三建筑工程公司的张百发、武汉重型机床厂的马学礼、上海锅炉厂的李福祥、哈尔滨车辆厂的苏广铭、青岛木材综合加工厂的徐呈龙、汕头机械厂的罗木命等等同志，都是大家熟知的技术革新的能手。千百万技术革新能手的出现，表现了我们工人阶级不仅有冲天的革命干劲，而且有无穷的智慧，不仅能够苦干、实干，而且能够巧干。只要我们继续解放思想，开动脑筋，努力钻研科学技术，我们就一定能够创造出更多的奇迹。
    当前的技术革新和技术革命运动，必须按照放手发动群众、一切经过试验的原则，围绕生产中的关键问题，积极地改进设备，改进操作方法，改善工艺，改善产品设计，采用新的原料、材料和寻找代用品，并且实行手工劳动的机械化和半机械化，以大大地提高劳动生产率，提高产品的质量，降低原料、材料的消耗。同时，应当努力攻克尖端技术。设备陈旧的中小型企业固然应当进行技术革新和技术革命，现代化设备的大型企业同样应当进行技术革新和技术革命。在技术革新和技术革命中，能采用洋办法的我们就采用洋办法，不能采用洋办法的我们就采用土办法，或者是采用半洋半土的办法，把洋的和土的结合起来。企业领导者要善于根据各个时期的任务和生产上的关键，提出技术革新和技术革命的目标和重点，交群众广泛讨论，再把群众的建议集中起来，加以分析，经过试验证明有效后，坚决实施和推广。
    在所有的工业、交通运输、基本建设、商业、财政、金融的企业单位中，都要广泛开展学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮落后的竞赛。广泛地开展这种竞赛，解决先进和落后的矛盾，变少数先进者的水平为全社会的生产水平，这是我们社会主义社会中提高生产的重要方法。正如刘少奇同志在1956年工业先进生产者代表大会上所说的：“生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。”
    “一人先进只是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海”。目前有许多的先进生产者和先进生产单位，不仅自己保持先进，而且积极帮助落后赶上或超过自己的水平。上海电机厂是一个先进生产单位，在同行业的竞赛中，发现先锋电机厂在技术上和原料、材料供应上有许多困难，就主动地动员本厂的职工进行多方面的帮助，使这个厂也顺利地完成了国家计划。这里，我们还可以举出西北第一棉纺织厂的细纱女工赵梦桃同志，她七年以来月月都全面地完成任务。在她的帮助下，小组的成员都陆续地达到先进的水平，使全组接连六年都超额完成了国家计划，成为全厂的模范。她还尽力帮助其他组的工人赶上先进。在她的影响下，先进帮落后、落后赶先进的竞赛运动，已经在全厂开展起来。这种先进帮助落后的动人事迹，是普遍存在的，它已经成为我们竞赛运动中的最重要的特点，它表明了我们工人阶级的高贵品质。这样的竞赛，完全是社会主义的同志式的竞赛，完全不同于资本主义的竞争。我们希望全国所有的先进生产者和先进集体，都能够继续提高共产主义觉悟，发扬共产主义风格，自己保持先进，又无私地帮助别人，从而促进社会主义建设事业的大跃进。目前，不少地区、厂矿创造的新的竞赛形式，其中许多种对于鼓舞先进分子，推动和帮助中间分子和落后分子，有着重要的作用，今后应当广泛地加以运用。鞍钢第三炼钢厂创造的技术表演赛，对于普遍地提高工人的技术和发扬共产主义互助精神，有很大的作用，值得加以推广。
    我们不仅要提倡先进帮助落后，提倡一个企业内部的密切协作，而且要提倡企业之间、产业之间，以及生产、运输、供应各个环节之间的社会主义大协作。在社会主义制度下，社会主义的经济基础，决定了个人和集体、企业和企业之间根本利益的一致性，因而必须而且能够完全做到自觉地互相支援和密切协作。大跃进以来，有无数事例，都生动地告诉我们，社会主义大协作所产生的力量，决不等于个别生产力的简单总和。它不仅可以大大提高个别生产力，而且可以创造出新的更大的生产力。我们必须大大发扬服从整体、照顾大局、先人后己、与人方便的共产主义风格。对于在大跃进中所逐步发展起来的铁路、公路、港口、厂矿之间的协作，生产、供应、销售之间的协作，以及有关的办法和制度，应当坚持下去，并且不断创造新的办法。
    为了胜利地担负起愈来愈大的建设任务，所有的职工同志们必须努力学习，不断地提高自己。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”不但新工人、青年工人要努力学习，而且老工人、先进生产者也要努力学习。许多老工人和先进生产者所以能够不断地革新技术，就是由于他们发扬了实事求是的、敢想敢说敢做的精神，能够勤学苦钻，掌握生产技术。要改造客观世界，首先就要认识客观世界。我们不仅要努力学习技术，而且要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高政治觉悟。又红又专、红透专深，是对全国革命知识分子和技术人员的要求，也是对全国工人和干部的要求。提高文化水平，是掌握技术、学习政治和学习理论的钥匙。每个同志都应当根据自己的不同情况，努力学习文化。所有的先进生产者，尤其应当虚心学习，在已有成就的基础上继续前进，并且更好地发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。
    我们现在所处的形势是非常好的。在我们国内到处都呈现出一片力争上游和欣欣向荣的兴旺气象。在国际上，东风进一步压倒西风，和平和进步力量正在愈来愈显著地超过战争和反动力量。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的经济、文化事业正在一日千里地向前发展。我国人民的社会主义建设事业也愈来愈多地获得世界广大人民的同情和支持。我们的前景是异常光明的，我们对今后的胜利满怀着信心。让我们全国先进生产者和广大职工，同全国人民一道，在中国共产党和我们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的引导下，更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的红旗，沿着1958年所开辟的大跃进的胜利道路，为取得今年国民经济跃进的新胜利，为明年和以后年份的继续跃进，为在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平，为迅速地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家而英勇奋斗吧！（附图片）
