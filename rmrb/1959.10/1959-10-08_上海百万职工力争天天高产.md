    Shanghai's Million Workers Strive for Daily High Production

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: After a joyous holiday, over a million workers in Shanghai have returned to their production posts with even greater enthusiasm, beginning a new battle. They are determined to fight hard in October, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule in one go.

These days, workers in various steel plants are calculating backwards every day: How many days are left until the end of the year? To complete the state plan of producing 1.65 million tons of steel fifteen days ahead of schedule, how much needs to be completed each day? They are organizing daily high production according to this goal. The Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 is carrying out mass movements to set new records in all links of furnace building, steelmaking, steel pouring, pig iron furnaces, and transportation. Rapid furnace building is an important link for the plant to further increase steel production. In the past, it took them ten hours to build a converter, and the furnaces often couldn't keep up. In September, it was compressed to two hours. On October 2nd, the Zhang Zhijiang group created a new record of one hour and twenty-two seconds, which was quickly broken by other groups in succession. On the 5th, the latest record created by the Zhu Zigang group was only forty-nine minutes.

Starting from the morning of the 5th, all industries fully resumed work after the holiday. The workers were in high spirits, and everywhere was a scene of tension and joy. Workers at the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory proposed to complete ten days' worth of tasks in the six working days of early October, and they must make up for the four-day holiday deficit. They prepared enough raw materials for the post-holiday battle at the end of September; during the holiday, some advanced work sections rushed out a batch of semi-finished products. As soon as work started on the 5th, the assembly workers in the AC and DC motor workshops started three shifts, changing the usual practice of assembling less and only running one shift at the beginning of the month. The assembly team two improved its work efficiency by more than 50% in the first shift on the 5th.

Another prominent feature of post-holiday production is that technical innovation activities are being carried out with extra enthusiasm. During the holidays, workers did not forget to study innovation while visiting parks and relatives. Workers in the third medium-sized team of the metalworking workshop of the Shanghai Metallurgical Mining Machinery Factory discussed production tasks while playing in Hongkou Park during the holiday, and proposed using cyclone cutting to process screws, which could increase efficiency tenfold. The output plan for thermos bottle liners in the fourth quarter of the Jinqian Thermos Bottle Factory is 120,000 more than in the first half of the year. The main contradiction is the shortage of labor. On the 5th, the workshop was conducting time measurement to tap the potential of time, while also experimenting with a new technology to change the two processes of blowing small bottle liners into one, which can save one-third of the labor after success.

The leaders of various factories have tightly grasped the production organization work in early October, continuing to boost their energy and overcome right-leaning slack emotions. These days, many factories have successively held party committee meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings to summarize the experience of the great battles in August and September, and to arrange and discuss the more arduous production tasks for October and the fourth quarter, implementing the targets and measures to the groups. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Chemical Industry and its affiliated companies have more than 100 cadres going to factories every day to help the grassroots solve problems. The Party Committee of the State Cotton Mill No. 1 put forward specific requirements in terms of grasping ideology, grasping plans, grasping movements, grasping innovation, grasping equipment, grasping management, and grasping life, striving to reach the high-yield and high-quality level of the end of the year in advance in October.

While people were celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 280,000 workers in more than 800 factories in Shanghai's seven industrial bureaus continued to stick to their production posts, creating good conditions for the city to complete the more arduous production tasks in the fourth quarter. The 100,000 steel workers turned the holiday into a day of increased production. From the 1st to the 4th, although some equipment was being overhauled, they still produced more than 27,000 tons of steel, more than 5,000 tons more than the first four days of last month. Employees on the machinery, electrical machinery, chemical, textile, light industry, and transportation fronts also seized the time to actively carry out continuous production.

    为提前完成全年计划而奋斗
    上海百万职工力争天天高产
    据新华社上海7日电　上海一百多万职工在度过欢乐的假日以后，以更为饱满的热情，走上生产岗位，开始了新的战斗。他们决心大战10月，大战第四季度，一鼓作气地提前完成今年全年的跃进计划。
    这几天，各钢厂职工天天都在算倒流水账：距年底还有多少天？提前十五天完成全年产钢一百六十五万吨的国家计划，每天需要完成多少？他们按照这个目标，组织每天的高产。上钢五厂在砌炉、炼钢、浇钢、化铁炉、运输各个环节，开展群众性的新纪录运动。快速砌炉，是这个厂进一步增加钢产量的重要环节。过去他们砌一个转炉要十个小时，炉子常常周转不过来。9月份压缩到了两小时，10月2日张志江小组更创造了一小时又二十二秒的新纪录，这个纪录很快又被其他小组连续打破。5日，朱子淦小组创造的最新纪录只有四十九分钟。
    从5日清晨开始，各行各业节后全面开工，工人们斗志昂扬，到处是一片紧张、愉快的气氛。上海电机厂工人提出要在10月上旬的六个工作日里，完成十天的任务，一定要把四天假日的缺额补足。他们在9月底就准备足了节后大战用的原料材料；节日中，又有一部分先行工段赶出了一批半成品。5日一开工，交直流电机车间装配工人就开足三班，改变了历来月初装配少、只开一班的惯例。装配二组在5日第一班里，工作效率就提高了50％以上。
    节后生产的又一个显明特色，是技术革新活动开展得格外热烈。在节日期间，工人们游公园、串门子，也不忘研究革新。上海冶金矿山机械厂金工车间中型第三小组工人节日在虹口公园游玩时，就讨论了生产任务，提出采用旋风切削来加工螺丝，效率可以提高十倍。金钱热水瓶厂第四季度瓶胆的产量计划比上半年还多出十二万只，主要矛盾是劳动力不足。5日，车间里一面在进行工时测定，挖掘时间的潜力；一面在试验一种新的技术，把吹小型瓶胆的两道工序改为一道，成功后可以节约三分之一的人力。
    各厂领导紧紧抓住了10月初的生产组织工作，继续鼓足干劲，克服右倾松劲情绪。这几天，许多工厂纷纷召开党委会、干部会、群众大会，总结大战8、9月的经验，布置讨论10月份和第四季度更加繁重的生产任务，把指标和措施落实到小组。上海市化学工业局及其所属公司天天有一百多个干部下厂，帮助基层解决问题。国棉一厂党委会提出了抓思想、抓计划、抓运动、抓革新、抓设备、抓管理、抓生活等方面的具体要求，争取10月份提前达到年底的高产优质水平。
    在人们欢度建国十周年假日的时候，上海七个工业局中就有八百多个工厂的二十八万多工人继续坚守在生产岗位上，为全市完成第四季度更为繁重的生产任务创造良好的条件。十万钢铁工人把节日变成了增产日，1日至4日尽管有一部分设备进行检修，仍然炼出了二万七千多吨钢，比上月头四天多五千多吨。在机械、电机、化工、纺织、轻工业和交通运输战线上的职工，也都抓紧时间积极进行连续生产。
