Praising Wuhan Steel Amidst the Great Leap Forward
By our correspondent Cao Baoming

Indeed, anyone who stays in Wuhan Steel for a few days will have one prominent feeling: fast! In a large enterprise, the time between putting two main projects into production is usually three to several months. Wuhan Steel, Wuhan Steel of the Great Leap Forward, put the sintering plant, the mineral processing plant, and twenty-eight steelmaking projects of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace system into production one after another in a month and five days from the end of August to the end of September, making the ironmaking system of the first phase of Wuhan Steel's construction basically completed, and the steelmaking system also initially formed. A month ago, I personally saw the No. 1 open-hearth furnace produce steel; today, I am guarding the No. 2 open-hearth furnace—this giant open-hearth furnace known as the "King of Open-hearth Furnaces"—watching the molten iron being poured into the furnace, splashing thousands of golden flowers. The steelworkers in work clothes opened the furnace mouth, and hundreds of tons of molten steel poured out of the furnace like a waterfall.

In Chinese history, which dynasty, which government, has ever built such a steel enterprise from the ground up? None! The feudal dynasty of the late Qing Dynasty once purchased equipment from the British Heiseid Factory and spent more than three years building the Hanyang Iron Works, including two small blast furnaces and a pair of small converters, at the foot of Turtle Mountain. However, due to the sabotage of British imperialists, the steel ingots smelted from Daye's high-quality ore were cracked as soon as they were sent to the rolling mill, and they were unqualified, so they had to be reorganized and rebuilt. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government also repeatedly declared that it would build the Central China Iron and Steel Company with an "annual output of one million tons of steel" in Daye according to the design of the American McKee Company, but later it was reduced to "150,000 tons of steel," and then reduced to "3,500 tons of steel." Five years passed, and when this reactionary regime was about to collapse, the Central China Iron and Steel Company still did not produce iron or steel. However, the people living in the Mao Zedong era, the people inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, with the help of the Soviet Union, cut mountains, built roads, and built factories. In just two and a half years of formal construction, they successively put ten main factories and mines and twenty-two auxiliary workshops into production, completing nearly half of the total workload of the two phases of Wuhan Steel's construction. Wuhan Steel, which was originally scheduled to produce iron on "July 1" this year and produce steel on "July 1" next year, produced iron and steel in September last year and September this year, respectively, advancing the construction progress of various projects by nine months across the board.

"No difficulties before heroes, heroes emerge in the face of difficulties." Last year, Li Huanbo and other fourteen welders, new to the blast furnace, were burned with welding slag on their arms and necks because of lack of experience, welding a circle in eighteen hours. This year, welding the No. 2 blast furnace was shortened to eight hours, and the fastest was six hours to weld a circle. Not only that, this year the young welders of Gong Youmin's group, who were new to the blast furnace, also undertook the task of welding a 270-ton molten steel tank with the help of Li Huanbo's group, creating a miracle!

Last year, many components and equipment for Wuhan Steel's project needed to be supplied by the Northeast, and even supported by the Soviet Union. This year, Wuhan Steel's manufacturing strength has grown. In addition to complex equipment such as giant ingot cranes and charging machines still being supplied by the Soviet Union and Anshan Iron and Steel, other equipment such as the world's first-class blast furnace shell, the metal components of the "King of Open-hearth Furnaces," the world's largest welded molten steel tank (referring to the welded part), and a 1,000-kilowatt large motor were all made by themselves with the help of Soviet experts.

The Wuhan Steel Party Committee has also accumulated experience in rapid and high-quality construction such as "concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles" and "organizing large-scale construction cooperation" in the construction process, and comprehensively promoted "multi-layer cross-parallel flow operations" on the construction site. In the forty-meter-high steelmaking plant, counting from top to bottom: laying roof panels, welding roof truss tie rods, riveting crane wing plates, erecting furnace wall pipe networks, installing furnace bottom steel plates, laying underground sewers... Up and down, the arc of electric welding mixed with the sound of rivet guns, there were more than ten layers of construction at the same time, forming a magnificent three-dimensional construction scene.

In this way, the No. 1 blast furnace, which was planned to take 708 days to complete, was built with 330 days of effective construction period, and created a record of pouring the blast furnace foundation in 27 hours. The No. 2 blast furnace, however, poured the blast furnace foundation in 16 hours and completed the entire project in 140 consecutive days, becoming a model of rapid and high-quality construction in the country. Then, the No. 1 open-hearth furnace completed the installation of more than 6,000 tons of metal components in 134 days, which was one-third more than the 4,000 tons completed by the No. 2 blast furnace in the same period. The number of furnace body metal components and refractory bricks of the No. 2 giant open-hearth furnace is much larger than that of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, but it took 7 days and 29 days less than the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, respectively.

This year, on the construction site of Wuhan Steel's blast furnace, three 40-meter-high hot blast stoves rose from the ground in five days, and the more complex blast furnace body was installed in twelve days. Watching the various giant projects stretch into the air section by section, it was truly thrilling. The steelmaking construction site, which was originally under construction on the ground, was even more like "spring rain overnight, full garden of spring." Not long after the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was conveyed, the twenty-eight steelmaking projects immediately rose up and announced their simultaneous completion. Immediately afterwards, the No. 2 giant open-hearth furnace, which is 38% larger than the largest open-hearth furnace in the United Kingdom, was also built with an effective construction period of one month. Now they have started a big battle on the construction site of the future rolling mill.

As a result of such rapid and high-quality construction, Wuhan Steel has transported 700,000 tons of pig iron, 480,000 tons of coke, and nearly 70,000 tons of benzene oil, tar, and fertilizer powder to the whole country in fleets of ships and trains. The two newly built large open-hearth furnaces will also produce nearly 400,000 tons of steel in nine months. In 1949, the whole country only produced 250,000 tons of iron and 150,000 tons of steel, including local iron. What could be more in line with the socialist principle of thrift and more "worthwhile" than increasing production by millions of tons of steel?

Recently, Hubei Province has launched a general line education campaign. Many units have adopted an effective education method: organizing everyone to visit Wuhan Steel. Indeed, no matter how much trouble you have, how many things you can't figure out, when you see this magnificent construction and the workers' heroic labor, you will feel broad-minded and full of energy. Many people praise Wuhan Steel, and they all love to compare it to a steel warrior, saying that it has mounted a galloping horse; they love to compare it to a set of music, saying that it has issued the strongest voice of peaceful construction. I think it is better to compare it to a book, a textbook of the Great Leap Forward, a textbook of socialist construction, which is worth reading carefully by each of us. (Attached picture)

    跃进声中颂武钢
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    的确，谁来武钢住上几天，都会有这样一个突出的感触：快！在一个大型企业里，两项主体工程投入生产的时间，一般都得相距三几个月。武钢，大跃进的武钢，却在8月底至9月底的一个月零五天中，将烧结厂、选矿厂和一号平炉系统的二十八项炼钢工程相继投入了生产，使武钢第一期建设的炼铁体系基本建成，炼钢体系也初步形成。一个月以前，我曾亲眼看到一号平炉出钢；今天，我又守在二号平炉——这座被称为“平炉之王”的巨型平炉前面，眼望着正兑入炉里的铁水溅起万朵金花。穿着工作服的炼钢工通开炉口，立刻从炉里倾泻出瀑布般奔腾的数百吨钢水。
    在我国历史上，有哪个朝代，哪个政府，曾经从平地建起这样一座钢铁企业？没有！清代末年的封建王朝，曾经购买英国谐塞德厂的设备，花了三年多时间，在龟山脚下建起包括两座小高炉和一对小转炉的汉阳铁厂，但由于英国帝国主义者捣鬼，用大冶优质矿石炼出来的钢锭，一送上轧机就被压裂了，不合格，不得不改组重建。抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动政府也一再宣扬，要根据美国麦基公司的设计，在大冶建设“年产一百万吨钢”的华中钢铁公司，后来却缩小为“十五万吨钢”，再缩小为“三千五百吨钢”。五年过去了，这个反动政权临垮台的时候，华中钢铁公司还依然不出铁，也不出钢。但是，生活在毛泽东时代的人民，为党的社会主义建设总路线所鼓舞的人民，却在苏联帮助下，削山、筑路、建厂，正式建设只不过两年半，便先后将十座主体厂矿和二十二个辅助车间投入了生产，完成了武钢两期建设的总工作量将近一半。原订在今年“七一”出铁、明年“七一”出钢的武钢，都分别在去年9月和今年9月出铁、出钢了，将各项工程的建设进度普遍提前了九个月。
    “英雄面前无困难，困难面前出英雄”，去年，厉焕波等十四名电焊工，初上高炉，因为缺乏经验，胳膊和脖子被电焊火渣烫得斑斑点点，十八个小时焊一圈，今年焊接二号高炉，缩短到八小时，最快六小时焊一圈。”不仅这样，今年新上高炉的龚友民组的青年焊工，也在厉焕波组的帮助下，经过半年锻炼，便担负起焊接二百七十吨的钢水罐的任务，创造了奇迹！
    去年，武钢工程上的许多构件、设备，都需要东北供应，甚至苏联支援。今年，武钢的制造力量便成长起来了。除了巨型铸锭吊车和装料机这些复杂的设备仍由苏联和鞍钢供应外，其他如世界第一流的高炉炉壳，“平炉之王”的金属构件、世界上最大的焊接钢水罐（指焊接部分）和一千瓩的大型电动机，都在苏联专家帮助下由他们自己制作了。
    武钢党委也在建设中积累起了“集中优势兵力打歼灭仗”、“组织施工大协作”等快速优质施工的经验，在工地上全面推行了“多层交叉平行流水作业”。在四十米高的炼钢厂里，从上往下数：铺屋面板，焊屋架拉筋，铆吊车翼板，架炉壁管网，安炉底钢板，敷地下水道……上上下下，电焊弧光夹着铆钉枪声，共有十来层在同时施工，构成了一座雄伟的立体施工图景。
    这样，计划七百零八天工期的一号高炉，以三百三十天有效工期建成了，并创造了二十七小时浇成高炉基础的纪录。二号高炉却又以十六小时浇成高炉基础，以连续一百四十天建成全部工程，成为全国快速优质施工的典范。接着，一号平炉又在一百三十四天中完成了六千多吨金属构件安装任务，比二号高炉同时间内完成的四千吨还多三分之一。二号巨型平炉的炉体金属构件和耐火砖的数量都比一号平炉大得多，但是它又分别比一号平炉少用了七天和二十九天。
    今年的武钢高炉工地，五天就从平地升起了三座四十米高的大热风炉，十二天就安起更为复杂的高炉本体，眼望着各项巨型工程向空中节节伸展，真是惊心动魄。本来还在地面施工的炼钢工地，更是“一夜春雨，满园春色”，八届八中全会的精神下达不久，二十八项炼钢工程便立时全部升了起来，宣布同时建成。紧跟着，比英国最大的平炉还大38％的二号巨型平炉，也以一个月的有效工期建起来了。现在他们又开始大战在未来轧钢厂的工地了。
    这样快速优质施工的结果，武钢已经以成群的轮船、火车，向全国输送了七十万吨生铁、四十八万吨焦炭和近七万吨苯油、焦油、肥田粉。新近建成的两座大平炉，也将在九个月里生产将近四十万吨钢。而1949年全国连土铁在内，总共才生产了二十五万吨铁和十五万吨钢。还有什么能比这增产上百万吨钢铁更合乎社会主义节约原则，更“划得来”的事呢？
    最近，湖北省开展总路线教育运动。许多单位都采取了个有效的教育办法：组织大家到武钢参观。的确，无论你有多大烦恼，多少事情想不开，当你看到这宏伟的建设和工人们的豪迈劳动，你便会心胸开阔，干劲冲天。许多人歌颂武钢，都爱把它比做钢铁战士，说它跨上了飞腾的骏马；爱把它比做一组乐曲，说它发出了和平建设最强音。我想，还不如把它比做一本书，一本大跃进的教科书，一本社会主义建设教科书，值得我们每个人认真阅读。（附图片）
