Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: The magnificent production competition movement on the national iron and steel industry front has pushed steel production to a new level. In September, the national output of steel, iron, and steel products all exceeded the state plan. Steel production increased by more than 200,000 tons compared to August—this excess production is much greater than the total national steel production in 1949, the year of the founding of the People's Republic. Iron and steel products increased by more than 400,000 tons and about 100,000 tons respectively compared to August. This is the most precious gift that the heroic iron and steel industry workers have presented to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.

The most prominent feature of the iron and steel industry front in September is that both key and general iron and steel enterprises reported frequent successes, and production is booming. From September 1st to 25th, Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) set new daily production records for steel and iron seven times. The output of Shanghai steel plants, which ranks second only to Ansteel in steel production, is also rising steadily. The highest daily output record created on September 25th increased sharply by 75% compared to the average daily output in August. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Yunnan and Qinghai Provinces all completed the state production plan for pig iron for the whole year ahead of schedule this month. Guizhou Province also completed the state plan for steel production for the whole year ahead of schedule. What is particularly encouraging is that in recent days, the daily output of major products such as steel, iron, and steel products of many key enterprises or local iron and steel enterprises has generally been consolidated at or close to the level of new records. This is a new and gratifying situation on the steel production front, which greatly encourages the confidence of all iron and steel industry workers to complete the task of 12 million tons of steel for the whole year ahead of schedule and exceeding the plan.

Due to the strengthening of production technology measures and the in-depth development of the production increase and economy movement centered on high yield, high quality, and low cost, comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, new achievements have been made this month in open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, or converters for steelmaking, large, medium, and small blast furnaces for ironmaking, and steel rolling. In mid-September, the average utilization coefficient of Ansteel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces reached 9.9, creating the highest record since they were put into production. Since September, the average utilization coefficient of the Dongfeng large blast furnace of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has also been as high as 2.33, exceeding Ansteel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces, which are the most advanced in the country in terms of utilization coefficient for large blast furnaces. The two new forces that grew up in the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking Movement last year—steelmaking converters and small blast furnaces for ironmaking—have made rapid progress. In mid-September, the average daily output of converter steel increased by 48% compared to August. Before August, the utilization coefficient of small local blast furnaces was generally only about 0.7, but now Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have exceeded 1. The qualified rate of pig iron from small and medium-sized blast furnaces in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions increased by 1% in mid-September compared to the first ten days of the month. The consumption of coke per ton of iron smelted has also been further reduced.

At present, the national steel workers are full of joy of victory, consolidating existing achievements, advancing victoriously, and striving to achieve greater victories in October and the fourth quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: The national coal mine workers have sung triumphant songs and presented gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic with the outstanding achievement of completing the third quarter's raw coal production task ahead of schedule by nearly 500,000 tons two days in advance. As of September 28, the cumulative output of raw coal in the country this year has reached more than 255.3 million tons, completing 76.3% of the annual plan of 335 million tons. Calculated according to the current production level, it is definitely possible to over fulfill this year's production plan.

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the national coal mine workers opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted their energy, and quickly launched a new upsurge of production increase and economy movement. In addition to the characteristics of deep mass mobilization and rapid output growth that it had before, a new feature of this new upsurge of mass production movement is that production is more comprehensively leaping forward. The production plans for 140 bureaus and mines across the country in September were completed four days ahead of schedule. From the first day of entering September to the 28th, the output of these bureaus and mines exceeded the plan every day. At the same time, tunneling work also overfulfilled the plan. The national coal mine production broke the previous practice of being slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, slack in the first ten days and tight in the last ten days, and slack in tunneling and tight in coal mining, and a new situation of balanced production and comprehensive leap forward has emerged.

Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the party committee secretaries and mine managers of various mines went deep into the grassroots units, mobilized the masses, and strengthened the command of the production front line. The responsible cadres of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and a deputy director went to the Fifth Mine to serve as the party committee secretary and mine manager, and deeply mobilized the masses, turning this mine from a long-term failure to complete the plan to a mine that overproduced every day. Now, the national coal mine workers are advancing victoriously, striving to overproduce more coal for the country; at the same time, they are actively preparing for production and doing a good job in electromechanical maintenance, determined to achieve a good start, a good day, and a comprehensive good result in October.

Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: The national coal mine capital construction workers comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan for September, presenting gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic with outstanding achievements.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry, a total of 35 mines were completed and put into production nationwide in September, with a total designed annual production capacity of 9.6 million tons, exceeding the national plan by 54%. The mine capacity put into production in September alone was 920,000 tons more than the total capacity transferred in the first eight months of this year.

    钢煤战线齐奏凯歌
    九月钢产量比八月增加二十多万吨超过1949年总产量
    三季度煤炭超产近五十万吨；35处新井九月投入生产
    据新华社30日讯　全国钢铁工业战线气势磅礴的生产竞赛运动，把钢铁生产推向了一个新的水平。9月份，全国钢、铁和钢材的产量都超额完成了国家计划。钢比8月份增产了二十多万吨——这个超产的数量比建国的1949年全国钢产量的总和还多得多。铁和钢材分别比8月份增产了四十多万吨和十万吨左右。这是英雄的钢铁工业职工向伟大的建国十周年献出的最珍贵的礼品。
    9月份，钢铁工业战线的最突出的特点是，无论重点或一般钢铁企业，都是捷报频传，生产蒸蒸日上。鞍钢从9月1日到25日，钢和铁的生产就出现了七次日产新纪录。钢产量仅次于鞍钢的上海各钢厂的产量也在节节上升，9月25日创造的日产量的最高纪录，比8月份平均日产量猛增了75％。新疆维吾尔自治区、内蒙古自治区、云南和青海两省都在本月份提前完成了全年生铁的国家生产计划。贵州省也提前完成了全年产钢的国家计划。特别令人振奋的是，最近几天许多重点企业或地方的钢铁企业，钢、铁和钢材等主要产品的日产量，一般都巩固在或接近于新纪录的水平。这是钢铁生产战线上的新的可喜的形势，大大地鼓舞了全体钢铁工业职工提前超额完成全年一千二百万吨钢的任务的信心。
    由于加强了生产技术措施和深入开展以高产、优质和低成本为中心的增产节约运动，比先进、学先进和赶先进，这个月无论是炼钢的平炉、电炉或转炉，炼铁的大中小高炉或轧钢方面，都取得了新的成就。鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉，9月中旬平均利用系数达到了九点九，创造了投入生产以来的最高纪录。本溪钢铁公司东风号大型高炉，9月以来平均利用系数也高达二点三三，超过了全国大型高炉利用系数最先进的鞍钢九号和三号高炉。去年在大办钢铁运动中成长起来的两支生力军——炼钢转炉和炼铁小高炉，更是进展迅速。9月中旬，转炉钢的平均日产量比8月份增长了48％。8月以前，各个地方小高炉的利用系数一般只是零点七左右，现在山东、浙江、安徽、江苏等省已超过了一。各省、市、自治区中小高炉生铁的合格率9月中旬比上旬提高了1％。每炼一吨铁消耗的焦炭也进一步降低。
    目前，全国钢铁职工满怀着胜利的喜悦，正在巩固已有的成绩，乘胜前进，争取在10月份和第四季度取得更大的胜利。
    据新华社30日讯　全国煤矿职工高奏凯歌，以提前两天超额近五十万吨完成第三季度原煤生产任务的优异成绩，向建国十周年献礼。到9月28日止，全国今年原煤产量累计已达到二亿五千五百三十多万吨，完成全年计划三亿三千五百万吨的76.3％。按现有生产水平计算，肯定可以超额完成今年生产计划。
    全国煤矿职工在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，反右倾、鼓干劲，迅速地掀起了增产节约运动新高潮。这个群众生产运动的新高潮，除去群众发动深入、产量增长迅速等以前所具有的特点以外，一个新的特点，是生产更加全面地跃进。全国一百四十个局、矿9月份的生产计划，提前四天就完成了。这些局、矿的产量，从进入9月份的第一天起到28日止，每天都超额完成计划。与此同时，掘进工作也超额完成了计划。全国煤矿生产打破了历来月初松月末紧、上旬松下旬紧、掘进松采煤紧的惯例，出现了均衡生产全面跃进的新局面。
    在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，各矿的党委书记和矿长等负责干部纷纷深入基层单位，发动群众，加强了生产前线的指挥工作。峰峰矿务局的党委负责干部和一位副局长到五矿担任党委书记和矿长，深入地发动群众，使这个矿由长期不能完成计划的状况一跃而变为日日超产。现在，全国煤矿职工正在乘胜前进，力争为国家超产更多的煤炭；同时积极作好生产准备工作和机电维修工作，决心作到10月生产开门红，日日红，全面红。
    据新华社30日讯　全国煤矿基本建设职工全面超额完成了9月份国家计划，以优异的成绩向建国十周年献礼。
    据煤炭工业部统计，9月份全国建成投入生产的矿井共有三十五处，总设计年产能力为九百六十万吨，超额54％完成了国家计划。9月份一个月投入生产的矿井能力，比今年头八个月移交的总能力还多九十二万吨。
