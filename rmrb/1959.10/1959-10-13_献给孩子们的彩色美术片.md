    The animated films "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate" and "The Radish Returns," the puppet film "The Story of Carving the Dragon," and the paper-cut film "The Fisher Boy" are four color animated films presented in the domestic new film exhibition month celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They are all productions of the Shanghai Animation Film Studio.

    The animated film "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate" (lower left image) is a product of the Great Leap Forward. It reflects the era's characteristics of going all out and striving for the top. It has a clear theme and novel style. This year, it participated in the Moscow International Film Festival and won a silver medal. The film depicts five little carp who, after listening to Grandma Carp tell the ancient story of jumping over the Dragon Gate, decide to find the place their ancestors longed for. They overcome all difficulties and finally swim to the Dragon Gate they imagined, which is actually a reservoir.

    The film is full of realism. It uses a fairy-tale style to inspire and educate children to be brave, not to succumb to difficulties, and to have great ambitions, go all out, and strive for the top for a better future. It depicts the grand construction of socialism, allowing children to deepen their love for socialism through the achievements of the motherland. The clever, firm, and bold typical character of the little black carp sets an example for children.

    In terms of artistic treatment, the entire film is full of rich imagination and joyful interest, bringing children into a fairy-tale world. Like the scene where Grandma Carp tells the story, while she tells the story, the illusion of the Dragon Gate vividly appears, captivating the audience. In the scene where the little carp try their best to jump over the turbulent waterfall one after another, people worry about the dangers the little carp encounter and are moved by their bravery. The scene after they jump over the reservoir is beautifully handled. The river water is so clear that you can see the bottom, with exotic flowers and strange rocks changing endlessly, and bubbles are placed on the heads of the little fish, creating a spectacular sight. In another scene, they quietly look towards the shore in the water, and the shore is brightly lit, like thousands of stars, twinkling and shining, making the tall and majestic buildings even more magnificent. All these scenes fully demonstrate the brilliant light of leaping over the Dragon Gate and a bright future.

    Another animated film, "The Radish Returns" (upper left image), is also a fairy tale. It tells the story of a little rabbit who finds a big radish in the snow and, when eating it, thinks of his friends, so he takes it to Little Deer, who takes it to Little Bear... and finally everyone shares it. Although the story is so simple, it is full of genuine sincerity in the children's world, and it inspires children to get along with their friends in a friendly way. The meaning is clear and easy to understand.

    The puppet film "The Story of Carving the Dragon" is adapted from a myth popular among the Bai people in Yunnan. It describes a carpenter and his apprentices who carve a wooden dragon and fight against an evil sow dragon, suffering setbacks. Later, the carpenter and the blacksmith cooperate to equip the wooden dragon with iron scales and iron claws, and add several small wooden dragons, finally defeating the sow dragon and eliminating a major harm for the people.

    This story is vivid and tortuous, demonstrating the noble qualities of unity, cooperation, and unyielding spirit of the working people in their fight against evil. The film has made significant progress in character modeling, scenery, and color compared to many puppet films released in the past. Many shots taken with special effects are very successful. The appearance of the sow dragon, the wooden dragon coming to life, and the fighting scenes are all cleverly and naturally handled, showing the characteristics of the mythical realm. The slight shortcoming is that it still carries some terrifying atmosphere, and the dragon fighting scenes are also slightly repetitive.

    "The Fisher Boy" (lower right image) is a paper-cut film. This is a new creation in animated films. It adopts the characteristics of Chinese shadow puppetry and paper-cutting art to create a new type of animated film with a strong national flavor.

    The film's story is based on a mythical legend that was popular among fishermen in the late Qing Dynasty, which was anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. It gives the audience a strong feeling that the working people are simple and lovable, and the reactionary rulers are treacherous and hateful.

    The whole film is colorful, and many scenes are very beautiful, especially the scene where the fisher boy jumps out of the white jade fish basin, suddenly shining with golden light, dazzling and dazzling. The fisher boy sings and dances, full of magical and beautiful charm.

    This is an animated film with rich political and educational significance. Children can learn from the story how imperialism and feudal rule once colluded to oppress us, and the suffering that our ancestors endured. This contrasts with today's free and happy days, making them love the Communist Party and love our present day even more. (Attached pictures)

　　献给孩子们的彩色美术片
　　曹懋唐
    动画片“小鲤鱼跳龙门”和“萝卜回来了”，木偶片“雕龙记”，剪纸片“渔童”是为庆祝建国十周年举行的国产新片展览月中展出的四部彩色美术片，它们都是上海美术片厂的出品。
    动画片“小鲤鱼跳龙门”（左下图），是大跃进中的产物。它反映了鼓足干劲、力争上游的时代特点，主题鲜明，样式新颖，今年参加莫斯科国际电影节，曾获得银质奖章。影片描写五条小鲤鱼在听了鲤鱼奶奶讲古老的跳龙门故事后，它们决心去寻找这祖先所向往的地方，它们排除了一切困难，终于游到了想像中的龙门，也就是现实中的水库。
    影片富有现实性。它运用童话样式，来启发和教育孩子勇敢、不向困难低头，为了美好的前途，要立大志、鼓干劲、争上游。它描绘了社会主义的宏伟的建设，让孩子们从祖国的成就中，加深对社会主义的热爱。小黑鲤鱼的机智、坚定而大胆的典型性格，为孩子们树立了榜样。
    全片在艺术处理上，充满着丰富的想像力和欢乐的情趣，把孩子们带进了童话世界。像鲤鱼奶奶讲故事的那场戏，鲤鱼奶奶一边讲故事，一边就形象地出现了龙门的幻景，引人入胜。小鲤鱼努力地在浪涛汹涌的飞瀑上面一条接一条的跳过的镜头，人们为小鲤鱼遇到的惊险而担心，被它们的勇敢所激动。它们跳过水库后的画面，处理得真美，河水是那么的清澈见底，水底奇花异卉，怪石嶙峋，变化万千，水泡一个一个套在小鱼头上，蔚为奇观。另一场，它们在水中悄悄地向岸上望着，岸上则是灯火通明，像万点繁星一样，闪烁争光，那些高大的、巍峨的建筑，显得更是瑰丽非凡。所有这一些画面充分显示了跃进龙门，前途似锦的灿烂光明。
    另一部动画片“萝卜回来了”（左上图），也是童话题材。写小兔在雪堆里拣到个大萝卜，在吃的时候，想起他的朋友来，于是，就拿去送给小鹿，小鹿又拿去送给小熊……最后还是大家分吃了。这部影片尽管故事这么简单，但充满了儿童世界的真情实意，它启发孩子们应该友爱地同朋友相处。意义鲜明，容易理解。
    木偶片“雕龙记”是根据云南白族中流传的一个神话故事改编的。它描述一个木匠和徒弟们雕成了一条木龙和无恶不作的母猪龙决战，遭受挫折。后来木匠和铁匠合作给木龙装上了铁鳞铁爪，又增加了几条小木龙，终于战胜了母猪龙，为人民除了大害。
    这个故事生动曲折，表现了劳动人民在同邪恶战斗中的团结合作和不屈不挠的高贵品质。影片在人物造型、布景、色彩各方面较以往发行的许多木偶片有显著的进步。有不少运用特技拍摄的镜头很成功。像母猪龙的出现、木龙变活和搏斗等几个场面，都很巧妙自然，表现出神话境界的特点。略嫌不足的是，其中还带着一些恐怖气氛，龙的搏斗场面也稍重复。
    “渔童”（右下图）是一部剪纸影片。这是美术片的新创造。它采用我国皮影戏和剪纸艺术的特点，创制成的具有浓厚民族特色的新型美术片。
    影片故事取材于清末流传在渔民中间的一个反帝反封建的神话般的传说。它给观众一个强烈的感觉，那就是劳动人民纯朴可爱反动统治者奸恶可恨。
    全片色彩鲜艳，很多画面非常美丽，尤其是白玉鱼盆里跳出渔童来的一场，骤然金光四射，灿烂夺目。渔童载歌载舞，充满了神奇优美的情调。
    这是一部富有政治教育意义的美术片。孩子们从故事里可以了解帝国主义和封建统治曾经怎样勾结欺压我们，先辈们经受过的苦难。这对比今天自由幸福的日子，使他们更热爱共产党，热爱我们的今天。（附图片）
