Xinhua News Agency, October 12th, Buenos Aires Dispatch: The Argentine Communist Party's weekly "Our Word" published an editorial on September 25th, condemning the Frondizi government for using the Communist Party as a pretext, claiming it was the main instigator of the recent general strike, and demanding that the court revoke the legal status of the Argentine Communist Party and disband the Communist Party.

The editorial stated: There is no doubt that the Argentine Communists stood at the forefront of this great struggle. However, to distort the facts by insisting that this great and just struggle was instigated by a certain faction is a distortion of the facts. Workers of all factions in Argentina participated in this struggle, shoulder to shoulder, without exception. This strike was announced and led by the "United Workers' Movement," and the just demands of the strike and the united action of the trade unions guaranteed the victory of this strike.

The editorial stated that the main culprits responsible for the current grave situation in Argentina are the Frondizi government and its accomplices, "especially the economic groups composed of big business owners, well-known stockbrokers, and confidants of foreign companies, particularly American companies." Those preparing for rebellion and stirring up chaos, causing endless cycles of coups and counter-coups, "are the various reactionary factions, military and non-military, of the landlord oligarchy and big capitalists," and they "dare to accuse the Communists of preparing rebellion and stirring up chaos." They believe that "the united action of the working class is 'rebellious' because they clearly know that a united working class is irresistible, and if the achieved unity of action is consolidated and expanded, if the worker-peasant alliance is established, and if the various democratic and patriotic factions unite their forces and struggle together for a common goal, their starvation and surrender plans will be defeated."

The editorial stated that attempting to declare the Communist Party illegal and disband it according to the will of imperialism will "not only affect the Communist Party but also the entire working class and all democratic parties." Now it is making Communists and Peronists illegal, and later it will make any democratic force that dares to defend national property, defend human rights, and civil rights illegal. The editorial called on all democratic parties, judges who respect their duties, legal professionals, and all upright, democratic, and patriotic people to rise up against this measure. The editorial stated that they have already risen up against this measure, which proves that Argentina's democratic potential is enormous. The editorial finally demanded that the parliament abolish this unconstitutional decree.

　　阿根廷共产党周刊“我们的话”发表社论
    号召人民击败当局反共措施
    新华社12日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷共产党“我们的话”周刊9月25日发表社论，谴责弗朗迪西政府借口共产党是最近总罢工的主要发起者，要求法院取消阿根廷共产党的法人资格和解散共产党。
    社论说：毫无疑问，阿根廷共产党人站在这一伟大斗争的最前列。但是，把这一伟大的正义斗争硬说成是某一派别主使的，这是对事实的歪曲。阿根廷所有各派别的工人都毫无例外地、肩并肩地参加了这一斗争。这次罢工是由“工人联合运动”宣布和领导的，罢工的正当要求和工会的团结行动，保证了这次罢工的胜利。
    社论说，阿根廷目前严重形势的主要负责人是弗朗迪西政府及其同谋者，“特别是由大企业主、著名的股票经纪人和外国公司，特别是美国公司的心腹组成的经济集团”。准备叛乱和挑起混乱、使政变和反政变不断循环的，“是地主寡头和大资本家的军事和非军事的各个反动派别”，而他们却“胆敢指控共产党人准备叛乱和挑起混乱”。他们认为“工人阶级的团结行动就是‘叛乱性的’，因为他们清楚地知道，团结的工人阶级是不可抗拒的，如果巩固与扩大已经取得的行动团结，如果工农联盟建立起来，如果各个民主爱国派别把自己的力量团结起来为共同的目的而共同斗争，他们的饥饿和投降计划就会遭到失败”。
    社论说，按照帝国主义意旨企图宣布共产党为非法和解散共产党，这种作法将“不仅仅影响到共产党，而且影响到整个工人阶级，影响到一切民主党派。”现在是使共产党人和庇隆主义党人成为非法，以后将使任何敢于保卫国家财产、保卫人权和公民权利的民主力量成为非法。社论号召一切民主党派、尊重自己职责的法官、法律界人士和一切正直、民主和爱国的人士都起来反对这个措施。社论说，他们现在已经起来反对这个措施了，这证明阿根廷的民主潜力是巨大的。社论最后要求议会废除这条违反宪法的法令。
