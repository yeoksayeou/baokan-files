    Catching Scorpions
    In the Mancheng mountainous area of Baoding City, Hebei Province, there are two Scorpion Mountains. The mountains are full of living flagstones, and many scorpions live under the flagstones. Scorpions can be used as Chinese medicinal materials. The local people catch hundreds of thousands of scorpions every year. This year, during the season when there were many scorpions, the local school organized scorpion-catching teams. In just two days, they caught more than 25,300 scorpions and sold them to the commercial department.
