Thousands of Communes and Households Raise the Red Flag
Guangdong Rural Areas Launch General Line Education Movement

(Our report) To prepare a solid ideological foundation for this winter and next year's greater leap forward, a massive mass movement for the re-education of the general line is being launched in the vast rural areas of Guangdong Province.

Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said in an analysis of the current rural situation at a meeting of county party secretaries that, after half a year of commune consolidation, the individual shortcomings in the early stages of communization have been corrected. Now, the people's communes have "firmly established themselves and embarked on a path of sound development." The key to further consolidating the communes in the future, in addition to vigorously promoting collective production and strengthening the collective economic base of the communes, is to strengthen the socialist education of commune members and raise their political consciousness to a new level.

Since the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC in August, opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, some unhealthy trends in the countryside have been suppressed, and the broad masses of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have been elated and overjoyed, and the entire rural situation has improved, with a great improvement in production. However, this is only the beginning. The education of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is still at the level of general propaganda, and it has not yet systematically and meticulously solved the ideological problems among the peasant masses. Therefore, it was decided to immediately conduct a re-education on the socialist general line in the rural areas of Guangdong Province.

Before October 9, local party committees, county party committees, and commune party committees in Guangdong Province, while grasping production, convened cadre meetings of thousands or tens of thousands of people. While opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale among the cadres, they began pilot projects for re-education on the socialist general line in rural areas. Due to the importance attached by various localities, pilot projects were rolled out batch by batch, and pilot projects were conducted in 1,800 production brigades successively. In early October, various localities summarized the experience of the pilot projects, and the Provincial Party Committee, after inspecting the pilot projects, officially summarized the pilot projects on October 9. The pilot projects proved that it is extremely important to conduct a general line education among the peasants.

On the evening of October 9, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC convened a telephone conference of prefectural and county party secretaries. Comrade Tao Zhu, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, officially announced that all rural areas in the province should immediately and comprehensively launch the re-education movement on the socialist general line, and regard this work as the central task of the current rural areas, so as to drive other work forward. The movement requires a victorious conclusion by the end of October or at the latest by November 10. Since it is a movement, there must be momentum and atmosphere, otherwise the effect will not be great and the impact will not be deep. The large-scale debate on the two roads in the autumn of 1957 in Guangdong Province consolidated the advanced cooperatives and brought about the great leap forward in 1958, precisely because a large-scale mass self-ideological education movement was launched at that time. This time, the specific practices of that time cannot be mechanically copied, but the experience of organizing a large-scale mass movement is very valuable. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee decided that during this period, from the Provincial Party Committee down, leaders at all levels must devote their main energy to grasping the general line education firmly, and strive to thoroughly solve the problems. Most of the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee will set out to the countryside in the coming days to study and guide at the same time. Some of the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee have already set out in recent days.

How can this rural socialist construction general line education movement be considered well done? The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC put forward three standards: First, the level of awareness of cadres above the production team should be greatly improved. For the very small number of impure elements in the organization, they should be replaced after rectification. Second, the broad masses of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants who account for 70% to 80% of the rural population, should unswervingly uphold the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. The vague understanding and erroneous thinking of some of them should be resolved through systematic education. Third, the production enthusiasm of the masses should be even higher, and they should be full of soaring energy to overfulfill this year's production increase plan and realize a greater leap forward next year.

In terms of the method of this education movement, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, based on the experience of the pilot projects, particularly emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to fully exposing thoughts and fully using the method of persuasion and education. People's ideological problems cannot be solved if they are not exposed. It is also impossible to get a real solution if you are not patient in solving ideological problems. The problem now is that some poor and lower-middle peasants with vague understandings are not brave enough to expose their vague thoughts because of face-saving and other reasons, and many cadres are not very confident in solving these problems and dare not boldly mobilize the masses to speak out freely, fearing that ideological problems will be exposed and not be solved well. In this way, preventing oversimplification and going through the motions has become an extremely important issue in the current movement guidance. To this end, it is necessary to make all cadres firmly believe that the fruits obtained by the broad masses after a year of hard work last year are very rich, and the truth is completely on our side. Moreover, in order to enable all cadres to learn to master the method of fully presenting the facts, reasoning, and patiently educating, the more thoroughly ideological problems are exposed, the more thoroughly they can be solved. And the best way to solve ideological problems is to calculate accounts, compare and recall. Because the problems raised by the masses are the most specific problems, and only through specific calculation and comparison can they be effectively solved. Therefore, it is necessary to universally calculate the comparison accounts before and after communization and before and after the ten years since the founding of the country, so that everyone can universally calculate and thoroughly calculate. Such a universal and thorough calculation will vividly and vividly calculate the superiority of the socialist system and the people's communes, and people's hearts will suddenly open up, and other specific problems will be easily solved.

According to the experience of the pilot projects, the Provincial Party Committee's specific steps for carrying out the movement are: first arm the party members, cadres, and activists with thoughts, and then conduct patient education among the poor and lower-middle peasants through speaking out, calculating accounts, recalling, and comparing, so that they can understand their thoughts. The third step is to select a very few rich middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts and behaviors for typical criticism. The fourth step is to turn to formulating production plans for this winter and next spring, production plans for next year, and long-term plans, so that people can see a bright future and feel that there is a great future. The Provincial Party Committee repeatedly emphasized that the entire education movement should be a process of carefully solving ideological problems and a process of patient education from beginning to end. Everyone should open their hearts and talk, and then sit down and exchange opinions calmly, gently, and peacefully to seek correct conclusions. This should be especially true in the two steps of arming cadres with thoughts and organizing the team.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC also decided that in this socialist construction general line education movement, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the party's class line in rural areas and clearly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. It should be understood that the ideological and political class struggle has not been extinguished, and the importance of relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants has not been weakened. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously support them, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants who resolutely support the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, so that they can stand up straight, so as to unite all the peasants to do a good job in this education movement, and also in the commune distribution system, according to the party's instructions, their interests should be given due consideration.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC also decided that the rural cadre team must also be rectified. In addition to the three-level cadre meetings at the county level that have already been convened, the commune will then convene meetings of party members, league members, activists, and cadres above the production team level, and conduct a serious education and rectification in the same way, by calculating accounts, comparing and recalling. For a small group of impure elements with serious right-leaning thoughts, they should be replaced by means of education and adjustment, and at the same time, a group of firm activists should be promoted to leadership positions.

    广东农村开展总路线教育运动
    本报讯　为今年冬天和明年的更大跃进准备雄厚的思想基础，广东省广大农村正在展开一个声势浩大的总路线再教育的群众运动。
    省委第一书记陶铸同志在县委书记会议上分析当前农村形势时说，经过半年来的整社工作，公社化初期工作中的个别缺点已经纠正。现在，人民公社已经“扎实地站稳了脚跟，走上了健全发展的道路”。今后进一步巩固公社的关键问题，除了大抓集体生产、壮大公社的集体经济基础之外，就是加强公社社员的社会主义教育，将社员的政治觉悟提高到一个新的水平。
    自8月份贯彻中共八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲以来，农村的某些歪风邪气已被压下去，广大农民群众，尤其是贫农、下中农扬眉吐气，欢天喜地，整个农村情况有所好转，生产大有起色。但是这仅仅是开始。八届八中全会的教育，还停留在一般宣传上，并没有也来不及系统地细致地解决农民群众中的思想问题。因此，决定在广东省农村中，立刻进行一次社会主义总路线的再教育。
    10月9日以前，广东省各地委、县委、公社党委，在一面抓生产，一面召开几千几万人的干部大会，在干部中反右倾、鼓干劲的同时，开始了农村社会主义总路线再教育的试点工作。由于各地重视，试点工作一批批铺开，先后在一千八百个生产大队中进行了试点。10月初，各地总结了试点工作经验，省委在检查了试点工作以后，于10月9日正式总结了试点工作。试点证明：在农民中进行一次总路线教育极为重要。
    10月9日晚中共广东省委为此召开了地、县委书记电话会议。陶铸同志代表省委正式宣布：全省所有农村，立刻全面铺开社会主义总路线再教育运动，并把此项工作作为当前农村的中心工作，以此带动其它工作前进。运动要求在10月底至迟11月10日胜利结束。既然是搞运动，就要有声势，有气氛，不然效果就不大，影响就不深。广东省1957年秋季农村两条道路的大辩论，巩固了高级社，带来了1958年的大跃进，就因为当时开展了大规模地群众性的自我思想教育运动。这一回的教育，不能生搬那次的具体做法，但组织声势浩大的群众运动的经验是十分可取的。因此，省委决定，这一段，从省委起，各级领导都要用主要精力，狠狠抓总路线教育，务求彻底解决问题。省委大部分负责同志近日就要出发到农村去，边学习，边指导，部分省委负责同志已于近日出发。
    此次农村社会主义建设总路线教育运动怎样才算搞好了？中共广东省委提出三条标准：第一、生产队以上的干部，觉悟程度大大提高。对于极小部分组织不纯分子，经过整顿，加以调换。第二、广大农民群众，特别是占农村人口70％到80％的贫农和下中农，毫不动摇地坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，对于他们当中的一部分人的模糊认识和错误思想，经过系统教育加以解决。第三、群众的生产热情更加高涨，鼓足了为超额完成今年增产计划和实现明年更大跃进的冲天干劲。
    此次教育运动的方法，中共广东省委根据试点经验，特别强调：一定要坚持充分暴露思想，充分运用说服教育的方法，人们的思想问题不暴露出来，是没法得到解决的；解决思想问题不耐心，也没法得到真正的解决。现在的问题是：部分有模糊认识的贫农、下中农，因为爱面子等等原因，还不勇于暴露自己的糊模思想，而许多干部对于解决这些问题又信心不很足，不敢大胆放手发动群众鸣放，生怕让思想问题暴露出来，解决不好。这样，防止简单从事、走过场，就成为当前运动指导上的一个极为重要的问题。为此，一定要使所有的干部都坚定地相信，经过去年一年苦战，广大群众获得的果实是非常丰硕的，真理完全在我们这一边；而且，为使所有干部学会掌握充分摆事实、讲道理、耐心教育的方法，思想问题暴露得越彻底，就越能彻底地加以解决。而解决思想问题的最好办法是，算账对比和回忆。因为群众提出的问题都是最具体的问题，只有通过具体地算账对比才能有效地加以解决。所以要普遍地算公社化前后和建国十年前后的对比账，让每一个人普遍地算和彻底地算。这样普遍地彻底地一算，就把社会主义制度和人民公社优越性鲜明地生动地算出来了，人们的心窍就会豁然开朗，其他具体问题就会迎刃而解。
    运动开展的具体步骤，省委根据试点的经验是：先把党团员、干部、积极分子的思想武装好，然后经过鸣放、算账、回忆、对比，在贫农和下中农当中进行耐心的教育，让他们把思想都弄通了，第三步才选择极个别的具有严重资本主义思想和行为的富裕中农进行典型批判。第四步，转入制订今冬明春生产计划和明年生产规划以及远景规划，使人们看到美好的将来，觉得大有奔头。省委反复强调说，整个教育运动应当自始至终是细致解决思想问题的过程，耐心教育的过程；要所有的人都把心里话敞开来谈，然后大家坐下来，平心静气、和风细雨地交换意见，求得正确结论。在武装干部思想和组织队伍这两步，尤其应当如此。
    中共广东省委还决定在这次社会主义建设总路线教育运动中，一定要认真贯彻执行党在农村的阶级路线，明确地依靠贫农和下中农。应当了解，现在思想上和政治上的阶级斗争并没有熄灭，依靠贫农和下中农的重要性并没有减弱。因此，一定要大力支持他们特别是坚决拥护总路线、大跃进和人民公社的贫农、下中农，使他们挺起腰杆，从而团结全体农民搞好这次教育运动，还要在公社分配制度上，按照党的指示，使他们的利益获得应有的照顾。
    中共广东省委还决定：农村干部队伍也一定要加以整顿。除了现已召开的以县为单位的三级干部会议之外，公社接着要召开党、团员积极分子和生产小队以上的干部会议，同样以算账对比和回忆的方法，进行一次认真的教育和整顿。对于一小批右倾思想严重的不纯分子，要采取边教育、边调整的办法加以调换，同时，把一批坚定的积极分子，提拔到领导岗位上来。
