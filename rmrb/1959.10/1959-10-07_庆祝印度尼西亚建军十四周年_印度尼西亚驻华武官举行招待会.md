    Celebrating the 14th Anniversary of the Indonesian Armed Forces
    Indonesian Military Attaché in China Holds Reception
    Xinhua News Agency, October 5th. Indonesian Military Attaché in China, Lieutenant Colonel Sutono, and his wife, held a reception on the evening of October 5th to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Armed Forces.
    General Yang Chengwu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was invited to attend the reception. On behalf of all members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended warm congratulations to the Indonesian friends. General Yang Chengwu said that the Indonesian army grew up in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for national independence. The common experiences of the Chinese and Indonesian peoples and their common goal of resisting imperialist aggression and opposing colonialism have made us sympathize with and support each other, and have naturally formed a close friendship. Now our two peoples have shaken off imperialist rule and are carrying out construction work to change the backwardness of our respective countries. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their failure, and they are constantly conspiring to carry out subversion activities and undermine the independence and unity of our countries. Therefore, our two countries must remain vigilant in the future struggle to defend independence.
    General Yang Chengwu concluded by saying that our friendship will continue to consolidate and develop under the guidance of the Bandung Conference spirit, and we will continue to work hand in hand for the common goal of opposing colonialism and defending peace.
    Lieutenant Colonel Sutono spoke first at the reception. After recounting the glorious struggle of the Indonesian Armed Forces over the past fourteen years, he said that with the strong assistance of the people, the Indonesian Armed Forces have achieved great victories in the struggle to suppress domestic rebels. Lieutenant Colonel Sutono then said that the long-standing friendly relations between Indonesia and China, as well as between the two peoples, also exist between their armed forces. He firmly believes that the friendship between the armed forces of Indonesia and China will grow day by day.
    General Fu Zhong, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Xu Shenji of the Air Force, and He Ying, Deputy Director of the First Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were invited to attend the reception.
    Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.
