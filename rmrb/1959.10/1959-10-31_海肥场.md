    Seaweed Farm
    Guo Feng
    You are a small bay on the eastern side of the island shore.
    Ah, you are a bay. Yunlong Mountain on the island juts out its cliffs on one side, and extends a small hill far into the sea on the other, a hill piled with many rocks, also growing weeds and some small trees, enclosing your bay...
    Ah, the Commune Party Committee decided to build a dormitory near the foothills of your bay, where the tide doesn't reach. Ah, a long, flat-roofed house facing the boundless ocean, with glass windows, has been built:
    --Oh, the seaweed farm workers' dormitory, its glass windows and doors facing the sea, has been built there.
    I saw two workers climbing onto the roof. What are they doing there? They are cleaning the chimney. Do the workers run their own canteen here? That's right. To return to the village, to the brigade headquarters, you have to cross the cliffs, cross the high Yunlong Mountain.
    You are a small bay on the eastern side of the island shore.
    Ah, you are a bay. The ocean carries layers of verdant waves, carries strings of white pearl-like foam, carries the rushing sound of waves and tides, crashing against your rocks, crashing against that hill...
    Ah, the Commune Party Committee decided to erect a thousand, ten thousand... bamboo poles on the beach in front of your bay, where the tide ebbs and flows. Ah, countless bamboo poles, like countless lemon eucalyptus saplings that have grown very tall, grow in an orderly fashion in your bay, grow on your beach submerged by the sea.
    --Oh, the seaweed farm's bamboo poles for cultivating seaweed, like countless lemon eucalyptus saplings that have grown very tall, have their branches and leaves pruned in winter, growing in their bay-like nursery.
    I see countless white moss growing on countless lemon eucalyptus sapling-like bamboo poles, countless seaweed like white fungus in the forest...
    You are a small bay on the eastern side of the island shore.
    Ah, you are a bay. Near the foothills, there stands a workers' dormitory with glass windows. The transparent wind of the ocean, the wind carrying the spray of the waves, blows against the glass windows. The island's bright sunshine shines on the roof of the workers' dormitory and its chimney.
    Ah, you are a bay. You are the seaweed farm of the Langqi Island People's Commune. There are so many bamboo poles there, like countless tall saplings that have been pruned and are preparing for winter, growing there. Ah, the sea carries its waves, crashing against your rocks, singing loudly...
    Ah, I see many, many sailboats, returning from your bay, carrying seaweed like tiny oysters, oh, that is the sweet gift the sea offers to our fields, to our wheat and rice ears; ah, I see many, many sailboats returning carrying the gifts of the sea.

    海肥场
    郭风
    你是岛岸东边的一个小小的海湾。
    呵，你是海湾。岛上的云龙山一边突出它的悬崖，一边向大海长长地伸出它的一座小小的丘岗，一座堆叠着许多岩石，也长着杂草和一些小树的丘岗，围成了你的海湾……
    呵，公社党委会决定在你的海湾靠近山麓的地方，那里海潮涨不到的地方，建筑一座宿舍。呵，一座长长的、面向无边无尽的海洋的、开着玻璃窗的平屋已经建筑起来了：
    ——哦，海肥场的工人宿舍，它的玻璃窗和门户面向着大海，已经建筑在那里。
    我看见有二个工人爬到屋顶上，他们在那里做什么呢？他们在那里打扫烟囱。工人们在这里自己办食堂么？对了。回到村里，回到大队部，要翻过悬崖，翻过高高的云龙山。
    你是岛岸东边的一个小小的海湾。
    呵，你是海湾。海洋携带着一层一层碧绿的波浪，携带着结成一串一串的白色的珍珠似的泡沫，携带着浪和潮流的哗响，向你的岩石冲击着，向那座丘岗冲击着……
    呵，公社党委会决定在你的海湾前面的海滩上，那里海潮涌到又退回去的地方，竖立起一千根，一万根……的竹竿。呵，无数的竹竿，好像无数已经长得很高的柠檬桉的树苗，间隔有次地生长在你的海湾里，生长在你的被海水淹没的海滩上。
    ——哦，海肥场的养殖海?的竹竿，好像无数已经长得很高的柠檬桉的树苗，在冬天里剪去它们的枝叶，生长在它们的海湾一般的苗圃里。
    我看见无数柠檬桉的树苗一般的竹竿上，生长无数白色的苔藓，无数树林中的白木耳一般的海?……
    你是岛岸东边的一个小小的海湾。
    呵，你是海湾。在你的靠近山麓的地方，那里建筑一座开着玻璃窗的工人宿舍。那海洋的透明的风，带着飞溅起来的波浪的水沫的风，吹着玻璃窗。那岛上的灿烂的阳光，照耀着工人宿舍的屋顶和它的烟囱。
    呵，你是海湾。你是琅岐岛人民公社的海肥场。那里有那么多的竹竿，好像无数长得高高的、剪去枝叶准备过冬的树苗生长在那里。呵，那大海携带着它的波浪在冲击着你的岩石，哗哗地高声歌唱着……
    呵，我看见很多很多的帆船，从你的海湾里，运载着像小小的海蛎一般的海?回来了，哦，那是大海献给我们的田野，献给我们的麦穗和稻穗的甘美的礼物；呵，我看见很多很多的帆船运载着大海的礼物回来了。
