    Shǐ Liáng
    A giant dragon dances in the East, waves splash furiously in the Pacific, everyone studies the General Line, ten years of education transforms the dark and yellow, heavy machinery is all self-made, shaking off poverty and blankness turning to prosperity and strength. Steel, coal, grain and cotton all exceed quotas, the commune organization is especially excellent, enthusiasm soars to the sky, wisdom abounds, people of all ethnic groups gather together. The workers' enthusiasm is at its highest, ten years of construction are truly magnificent, the forty-year dream of Chengdu and Chongqing, the Wuhan Bridge is even more majestic. Recently, eighty thousand spectators appeared in the capital's stadium, the Great Hall of the People was completed in October, the spirit of labor penetrates the sun and moon, the people's spirit is truly magnificent. Joyfully welcoming the tenth National Day, offering a toast, a hundred birds sing, ten thousand flowers bloom, auspicious clouds and the red sun shine brightly, six hundred million people sing in unison, immortal achievements belong to the Party, Long live Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, may you be forever young, happy and healthy.

    六亿人民齐歌唱
    史良
    巨龙起舞在东方，浪花怒溅太平洋，人人学习总路线，十年教育革玄黄，重型机器皆自造，摆脱穷白转豪强。钢煤粮棉都超额，公社组织尤优良，干劲冲天智慧多，各族人民聚一堂。工人热情最高涨，十年建设真辉煌，成渝四十年愿望，武汉大桥更雄壮。最近首都出现八万观众运动场，十月完成大会堂，劳动精神贯日月，人民魄力堂哉皇。欣逢十周国庆献华觞，百鸟争鸣万花放，庆云红日烂光芒，六亿人民齐歌唱，不朽功绩归于党，毛主席、共产党，万岁长青乐而康。
