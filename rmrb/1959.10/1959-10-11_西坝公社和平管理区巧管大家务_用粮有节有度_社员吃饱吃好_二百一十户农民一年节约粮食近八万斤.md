According to Sichuan Daily: The 210 peasant households of the Heping Management Area in Xiba Commune, Leshan County, Sichuan Province, under the principle of ensuring good and sufficient food, saved more than 79,400 jin of grain from the establishment of the commune last year to August this year. This averages out to more than 90 jin of grain saved per person, and the entire management area already has more than 45,000 jin of collective grain reserves.

Last year, the Heping Management Area had a bumper harvest, with total grain production increasing by 274% compared to 1957, averaging 1,040 jin of grain per person. In addition to overfulfilling the state procurement quota and retaining seeds and feed, each person actually received 454 jin of food grain. At the beginning of the bumper harvest, due to a lack of timely attention to conservation, many canteens lacked grain usage systems, resulting in waste. After discovering these situations, the Party branch educated the masses on conserving grain and organized discussions on the question of "Should we eat grain in a planned way?" At that time, the majority of commune members supported the branch's proposal of "economical consumption."

The Management Area Party branch also remembered the lesson of more than 20,000 jin of sweet potatoes rotting in large cellars in 1957. Therefore, when digging sweet potatoes, they implemented a "three changes and one responsibility" system for sweet potato storage, that is, changing large cellars to small cellars, changing large transport to small transport, and changing centralized canteen storage to household storage. Sweet potatoes were contracted to commune members for management, and if there were any signs of spoilage, they were dealt with immediately. Commune members reflected that this method was: "A thousand-jin burden is carried by a thousand people, everyone manages the grain that everyone eats." This ensured that more than 600,000 jin of sweet potatoes were not affected by spoilage, and fresh sweet potatoes were eaten until the rice transplanting season this May. In addition, this management area adopted the method of eating difficult-to-store grains first and easy-to-store grains later, which also avoided grain spoilage. When eating sweet potatoes, small, late-dug, and hoe-damaged sweet potatoes were eaten first, while large, early-dug, and undamaged sweet potatoes were saved for later. Commune members were given work points for storing grain to strengthen their sense of responsibility. In terms of eating fine grains, they also ate less first and more later, and broken rice and unfilling corn were eaten first. In this way, commune members ate better and better, and life became sweeter and sweeter.

Over the past year, the Party branch has consistently insisted on discussing matters with the masses and has summarized and promoted many experiences in saving grain. For example, after the corn harvest, it was mixed with rice; after the sweet potatoes were dug, more sweet potatoes were eaten; in the winter months and the New Year, it was mixed with green vegetables, radishes, and cowpea leaves; in April and May, it was mixed with green beans and cabbage; and in July and August, it was mixed with cowpeas and pumpkins. During rice transplanting and harvesting, three meals a day were eaten, with more fine grains and fewer coarse grains; during slack farming seasons, two meals a day were eaten, with more coarse grains and fewer fine grains.

Last December, an effective grain usage system was formulated, implementing the method of "setting quotas per person, assigning tables per household, planning grain consumption, and whoever saves gets to keep it." "Setting quotas per person" means determining a quota standard for each period based on the busyness and labor intensity of the commune members. After implementing quotas per person, the entire management area saved more than 65,700 jin of grain in eight months. In addition, the canteens in this management area planted a lot of vegetables, and by mixing vegetables with grain, more than 20,000 jin of food grain were saved throughout the year.

　　西坝公社和平管理区巧管大家务
    用粮有节有度　社员吃饱吃好
    二百一十户农民一年节约粮食近八万斤
    据四川日报消息　四川省乐山县西坝公社和平管理区的二百一十户农民，在保证吃好吃饱的原则下，从去年办公社到今年8月，节约了粮食七万九千四百多斤，每人平均节约粮食九十多斤，全管理区已经有集体储备粮四万五千多斤。
    去年，和平管理区大丰收，粮食总产量较1957年增长274％，平均每人有粮一千零四十斤。除了超额完成国家征购和留种留饲料外，每人实分口粮四百五十四斤。丰收之初，由于没有及时注意节约，许多食堂用粮无制度，发生了浪费现象。党支部发现这些情况后，向群众进行节约粮食的教育，同时组织大家辩论“应不应该有计划吃粮”的问题。当时，大多数社员都拥护支部提出的“省吃俭用”的主张。
    管理区党支部还记取1957年两万多斤大窖红苕霉烂的教训，所以在开挖红苕时，就实行了“三改一包”的红苕储藏责任制，即改大窖为小窖，改大搬运为小搬运，改集中食堂储藏为分户储藏。红苕包干给社员管理，如有霉变象征，立即处理。社员反映这个办法是：“千斤担儿千人担，大家吃粮大家管”。这样保证了六十多万斤红苕没有受到霉烂损失，使鲜苕一直吃到今年5月栽秧子。另外，这个管理区采取先吃难于保管的，后吃易于保管的办法，也避免了粮食的霉坏。在吃红苕时也是先吃小的、迟挖的、锄口损伤的，大的、早挖的、没有损伤的留在后来吃。社员保管粮食，都评给一定工分，以便加强责任心。在细粮的吃法上也是先少吃后多吃，碎米和不饱米的包谷就先吃。这样，社员就越吃越好，日子越过越甜。
    近一年来，党支部一直坚持有事和群众商量，总结和推广了不少节约粮食的经验。例如包谷收获后，就和大米掺着吃；红苕开挖后，就多吃红苕；冬腊月和新春就掺青菜、萝卜和牛皮菜吃，4、5月掺四季豆和莲花白，7、8月掺吃豇豆和南瓜。栽秧打谷时吃三顿，多吃细粮，少吃粗粮；农闲时期一天吃两顿，多吃粗粮，少吃细粮。
    去年12月，又订出了行之有效的用粮制度，实行了“以人定量，分户编桌，计划吃粮，谁剩谁得”的办法。“以人定量”就是根据忙闲和社员的劳动强度，一个时期定一个时期的定量标准。以人定量实行后，八个月中，全管理区节约粮食六万五千七百多斤，另外，这个管理区各个食堂种了很多菜，由于掺菜吃，全年节约了两万多斤口粮。
