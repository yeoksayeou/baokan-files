Light Industry Leaps Forward Under the Radiant Illumination of the General Line
Minister of Light Industry, Li Zhuchen

As the entire nation celebrates the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, I, with immense joy, join all light industry workers in warmly celebrating the great achievements of our motherland on all fronts over the past decade, and celebrating the great achievements on our light industry front. In these joyous days, we more clearly recognize that our free and happy new life, our victory, is the result of the 650 million hardworking and brave Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, following the general line formulated by the Party. The achievements of light industry over the past decade are proof of this assertion.

Over the past decade, China's light industry production has developed rapidly: output has greatly increased, quality has greatly improved, and a large number of new products have been successfully trial-produced and put into production.

Old China's light industry was very backward, with low technical levels. Many important raw materials could not be supplied domestically, and the layout was abnormally concentrated in a few coastal cities. Imperialist and bureaucratic capital occupied an absolute advantage, and national industry could not develop at all. The existing enterprises, due to the plunder of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, coupled with the destruction of long-term war, by the time of liberation in 1949, light industrial products generally decreased by one-third to one-half compared with the highest annual output in history. After liberation, light industry, like other sectors of the national economy, underwent tremendous recovery work. By 1952, the main products of light industry had exceeded the highest annual output before liberation. During the First Five-Year Plan, the light industry sector firmly implemented the Party's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts, liberating the productive forces from the shackles of the old relations of production. At the same time, key basic construction projects were carried out, especially mobilizing the masses to increase labor productivity, and fully exploiting the potential of existing enterprises. Around this central task, the vast number of light industry workers launched a vigorous labor competition, such as the increase production and practice economy movement, the technical innovation movement, and the movement of advanced producers and advanced production units, greatly improving the technical and economic indicators of various industries. By 1957, the vast majority of products had successfully completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, with a total output value increasing more than doubled in five years, an average annual increase of 17.1%.

At the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, the vast number of light industry workers firmly implemented the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As a result, unprecedented victory was achieved in 1958. In that year, light industry (calculated according to forty-one major products) increased by 40% compared to 1957, equivalent to more than twice the average annual growth rate of the past five years. In 1959, the Great Leap Forward continued, and the planned total output value of light industry increased by 30% compared to 1958, which is expected to be overfulfilled.

One of the main products of light industry, crude salt, produced 10.4 million tons in 1958, completing ahead of schedule the task of producing 10 to 11 million tons in 1962 as stipulated in the original Second Five-Year Plan. Machine-made paper produced 1.22 million tons in 1958, and the planned output of 1.6 million tons in 1959 will also reach the planned target for 1962 this year.

While increasing production, the quality of various light industrial products has also been greatly improved. For example, a pair of sneakers could only be worn for about 100 days in the early days of the First Five-Year Plan, but in the past two or three years, they could be worn for 160 to 170 days. Some light industrial products, such as Chongqing Changjiang brand accordions, Shanghai No. 100 Hero fountain pens, Tianjin Yellow Ox sole leather, Xi'an enamel products, and Taiyuan high-grade glass, have quality levels that approach or reach advanced international standards.

According to incomplete statistics from twenty industries, about 2,000 new products have been successfully trial-produced and put into production since the Great Leap Forward. For example, in the paper industry, there are various special technical papers used in the electrical appliance industry, medical equipment, radio facsimile, analytical testing, agricultural seedling cultivation, national defense industry, automobile industry, construction industry, and high-end packaging, as well as rayon pulp for making rayon; in the ceramic industry, there are various ceramic equipment such as acid-resistant pumps and alcohol towers; in the glass industry, there are optical glass, artificial gemstones, etc.; others include cameras, black and white movie film, X-ray film, photographic film, tempered glass, glass fiber, Chinese electric typewriters, watches, new types of fountain pens, and various new canned varieties, which are unprecedented in China's industrial history.

Significant achievements have also been made in light industry basic construction, which has not only increased new production capacity but also increased the proportion of light industry in inland and minority areas.

Basic construction in light industry is also experiencing a Great Leap Forward.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in basic construction of light industry reached 1.25 billion yuan, an average of 250 million yuan per year. In 1958 alone, it reached 700 million yuan, and the planned investment for 1959 is 730 million yuan (excluding local self-raised funds). During the recovery period and the First Five-Year Plan period, the newly added capacity of machine-made paper totaled 344,000 tons, while 390,000 tons were newly added in 1958 alone. One year exceeded the past eight years, and another 260,000 tons will continue to be added in 1959. The newly added capacity of sugar in the past eight years was 633,000 tons, and 790,000 tons were newly added in 1958 and 1959. In the past few years, the newly added capacity of crude salt was 1.44 million tons, and the newly added capacity was 5 million tons in 1958 and 1959. The capacity of other industries such as alcohol, silicates, dairy products, and oils has also increased.

Basic construction has not only increased new production capacity, but also created new light industrial sectors and added new products. For example, the paper industry has added nearly 230 kinds, beginning to change the situation inherited from old China in which various high-grade papers were dependent on imports. Paper-making blankets, copper mesh, wood pulp, celluloid and iridium for fountain pens, tannins and coatings for the leather industry, malt and hops for the beer industry, etc., have all begun to move towards self-sufficiency due to basic construction.

Another result of basic construction is that the unreasonable layout historically left behind, which was concentrated in large coastal cities far away from raw materials and sales markets, has begun to be adjusted, and the proportion of light industry in inland and ethnic minority areas has begun to increase.

In the process of China's light industry construction, a light industry technical team has rapidly grown and expanded, capable of independently designing many new types of factories and mastering many new production technologies. This is inseparable from the selfless assistance of socialist brother countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union helped us build the modern Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill with the latest technology and equipment, and sent excellent experts to provide specific guidance on production, design, and installation work. Democratic Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other brother countries have also helped China establish some light industrial factories. China and various brother countries have established technical cooperation relations.

The rapid development of light industry production has greatly improved the material and cultural life of the people and strongly supported other industrial sectors.

The rapid development of light industry production over the past decade has greatly improved the material and cultural life of the people. With the continuous increase in the purchasing power of the working people, many industrial consumer goods are no longer something that only a few dignitaries can enjoy. In the nine years from 1949 to 1958, the consumption level of light industrial products by the vast majority of people increased several times. For example, edible vegetable oil increased from 2.9 market catties per person in 1949 to 6.2 market catties, an increase of one time; sugar increased from 0.7 market catties in the same period to 3.3 market catties, an increase of 3.7 times; rubber shoes increased from 5.1 pairs per 100 people to 27.3 pairs, an increase of 4.4 times; paper increased from 0.7 market catties per person to 2.3 market catties, an increase of 2.3 times (excluding news and printing paper); thermos bottles increased from 1.78 per 100 people in 1952 to 5.3 in 1958, an increase of 1.9 times; clocks increased from 0.36 per 1,000 people in 1952 to 3.9 in 1958, an increase of nearly 10 times; fountain pens increased from 5.1 per 100 people to 8.4, an increase of 65%. Other light industrial products have also increased significantly.

The development of light industry has also played a role in supporting and cooperating with other brother departments. For example, various industrial technical papers, rayon pulp, various industrial ceramics and enamel, refined alcohol, high-grade glycerin, crude salt, etc., have played an important role in supporting other industries and national defense.

The facts of the Great Leap Forward in light industry and the benefits it has brought to the national economy and the people's livelihood prove that the Party's general line for socialist construction put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, are completely correct, and prove that the Party and Chairman Mao are very concerned about improving people's lives. Hostile elements at home and abroad have tried their best to spread rumors and slander, saying: "China is squeezing out light industry to engage in heavy industry and sacrificing people's lives," as if they are really "concerned" about the development of China's light industry and the lives of the Chinese people. In fact, this is a shameful trick of provocation, an exposure of the fear of China's comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The achievements of light industry over the past decade, especially the brilliant achievements since the Great Leap Forward, eloquently prove that China's people's lives have been greatly improved, and there will be even greater improvements in the future. On the contrary, the capitalist world is "setting in the west," taking a downward path; the absolute impoverishment of the broad working people there is an undeniable fact.

Important experiences gained in the Great Leap Forward in light industry

1. Carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, practice strict economy, and increase production.

What important experiences have been gained in the Great Leap Forward in light industry? There are mainly three points: First, vigorously carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, practice strict economy, and increase production; second, vigorously carry out mass movements and implement walking on two legs; and third, and most importantly, strengthen Party leadership, put politics in command, and constantly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, and struggle to implement the Party's general line.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the focus of light industry's vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation has been on saving raw materials, opposing waste, improving tools and equipment, and increasing labor productivity. In papermaking, the promotion of grass fiber pulping has been further promoted to save the country's timber resources. The percentage of wood pulp in the total pulp production was 53% in 1949, and it has decreased to 22% in 1959. In the wood already used, actively expand tree species and use waste materials, using a large number of substandard materials, bark, branches, rotten materials to replace good wood. Through rational product design, the rubber shoe industry adopted carbon black soles, sponge soles, microporous soles, and other methods. In 1958, the industry increased production by 30 million pairs. This year, on the basis of the state-approved amount of raw rubber, more than 10 million pairs have been added. The leather industry actively promotes pigskin leather making, and now pigskin leather making accounts for about one-fifth of all leather. Daily metal products have improved product design and adopted substitutes, greatly saving good steel, and simplifying the process and saving labor. In the ceramic industry, many enterprises have switched to coal as fuel and partially switched to gas furnaces, saving the country 500,000 to 600,000 cubic meters of timber every year. The glass industry vigorously promotes semi-gas furnaces to replace direct-fired furnaces, saving 100,000 tons of coal every year. In the ceramic industry, ceramics replace steel. According to statistics from fourteen provinces (cities), more than 80 kinds of ceramic industrial equipment produced in 1958 saved the country 70,000 tons of steel.

Old China's light industry had a poor foundation, with manual operation accounting for a large proportion and a heavy labor load. Therefore, the masses of workers had unparalleled enthusiasm for improving tools and equipment and implementing mechanization and semi-mechanization. In the paper, salt, ceramic, glass, and enamel industries alone, there were more than 700 major innovation projects in tools, equipment, and technology. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, the paper industry created more than 100 advanced technical experiences, with innovations in the entire process from raw material preparation, cooking, pulping, papermaking to finished product packaging, increasing production efficiency by 20% to 50%. The glass industry is promoting automatic bottle blowing machines, which greatly improve the working conditions of workers, and can improve quality and increase production. The salt industry vigorously promotes mechanization and semi-mechanization, saving a lot of labor.

2. Vigorously launch mass movements and implement the policy of walking on two legs

The main experience of the light industry in making great achievements in the technical revolution is to liberate the mind, break the old "almanac", vigorously carry out mass movements, and implement the three-way combination of leading cadres, the masses, and technical personnel. Facts have proved that the masses of workers and some technical personnel have unparalleled enthusiasm for technical innovation and technical revolution. They do not have to worry about losing their jobs after technical reforms like in capitalist countries. Therefore, in our country, the technical revolution has a broad mass base. Since the Great Leap Forward, it is some ordinary workers, ordinary cadres, and ordinary technicians who, with the care and support of the Party, have come up with many creations and inventions. For example, the person who created a grass paper manufacturing machine that was more than 40 times more efficient than the original manual operation last year was Zhang Ruilin, a sixteen-year-old boy who braided grass bags at the Jiashan County People's Paper Mill in Zhejiang Province. The change from intermittent pulping to continuous pulping in the pulping process of the paper industry, which increased work efficiency by 15% to 30%, was the result of a young technician from the Yanjing Paper Mill in Beijing and the workers boldly reforming on the basis of Soviet experience. Jiang Sirang, a 21-year-old worker with only a junior high school education from the Xuzhou Glass Factory in Jiangsu Province, turned manual bottle blowing into machine bottle blowing. These examples fully demonstrate that the working people have infinite wisdom; and that putting politics in command, fully mobilizing the masses, and implementing the three-way combination are the main experiences for achieving technical innovation and technical revolution. Future technical innovation and technical revolution will continue to prove and develop these experiences.

Since last year, light industry has been vigorously running small and medium-sized factories and people's commune industries, which is also an important aspect of vigorously launching mass movements.

60%-70% of the raw materials of light industry come from rural areas, and its products are mainly sold in rural areas. Therefore, under the condition of agricultural raw material growth, light industry adopts the principle of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods to help people's communes vigorously run industries, which has become very necessary. This can make full use of China's scattered resources, make use of the resources of mountainous and remote areas, reduce round-trip transportation and transportation towards each other, reduce the burden of rural areas in agricultural product processing, reduce the burden of women's housework, and most effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of people's communes and provinces (regions) and cities to vigorously run local industries. The layout of light industry tends to be reasonable, so as to achieve practical results that are greater, faster, better, and more economical.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "People's communes must vigorously run industries." In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, light industry departments at all levels, under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, implemented the policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, and simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. Now there are tens of thousands of factories in people's communes across the country, scattered all over the place. More than 700 small paper mills were built last year alone, producing about 700 tons of paper per day. More than 10,000 tons have already been produced in the first half of this year, and another 30,000 to 40,000 tons can be produced in the second half of the year. In the past ten years, the equipment capacity of China's alcohol industry, the mechanized part is only 100,000 tons, but last year it adopted the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, and added 250,000 tons of capacity in one year. In addition, the proportion produced by counties and communes in sugar, oil, rattan, bamboo and wood processing, and other agricultural product processing is very large. Our experience is: strengthen leadership and make overall plans; everything should focus on the development of agricultural production and the consolidation and development of people's communes, resolutely make county and commune industries serve agricultural production, serve large industries, serve exports, and serve residents' lives; make good arrangements in raw materials to ensure the smooth completion of the state's external transfer tasks; constantly help county and commune industries implement economic accounting systems, improve product quality, reduce raw material consumption and production costs, increase labor productivity, improve operation and management, and adapt them to the seasonal production of rural areas; in this way, it will be conducive to the consolidation and improvement of local industries and commune-run industries, and provide favorable conditions for greater development.

3. Strengthen Party leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and constantly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking

Practice has proved that in order to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of policies for walking on two legs in the light industry sector, it is necessary to strengthen Party leadership, implement putting politics in command, and resolutely and constantly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking. In this regard, Party committees at all levels have played a decisive role.

In the past few years, there have been some different understandings on the issue of light industry development. For example: in the paper industry, whether to focus on grass fiber or wood; in the leather industry, whether to focus on pigskin or cowhide; in the manufacture of equipment and machinery, whether to use only steel, or both steel and ceramics and other substitutes; in terms of the scale of running factories, whether to focus on running large factories, or running small and medium-sized factories; in terms of the technical equipment of factories, whether to only run foreign factories, or "combine indigenous and foreign methods," with both "indigenous" and "foreign," and so on. These different understandings, in essence, reflect the struggle between the two construction lines of greater, faster, better, and more economical results and lesser, slower, poorer, and more expensive results. In this struggle, we correctly implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, so that the above-mentioned different understandings have been unified. In the paper industry, the development policy of focusing on grass fiber was determined; in the leather industry, the development policy of focusing on pigskin was determined; in the manufacture of equipment and machinery, both steel and a large number of non-metallic materials such as ceramics should be used; in terms of the scale of running factories, the combination of large, medium, and small should be used, with small and medium-sized ones as the main focus; in terms of the technical equipment of factories, both indigenous and foreign methods should be used, from indigenous to foreign, and so on. This has ensured the rapid development of light industry.

In the struggle between the two construction lines, the struggle between focusing on grass fiber or wood in the paper industry is representative. In the past few years, many comrades believed that only wood pulp could make good paper. They were superstitious about wood pulp and belittled grass pulp. They were unwilling to understand the amount of timber reserves and logging in our country. Although the amount of forest logging in our country has increased year by year, and the afforestation cause has developed year by year, the demand for timber in various aspects of construction has also continued to increase. In this case, should we wait for the state to allocate papermaking timber, or should we use grass fiber to make paper? Adopting the former policy will inevitably delay the development speed of the paper industry. On the contrary, adopting grass fiber (including reeds, sugarcane dregs, rice straw, wheat straw, soybean stalks, sorghum stalks, cotton stalks, dragon's beard grass, malian grass, flax stalks, etc.) will be inexhaustible and will greatly accelerate the development of China's paper industry.

Using wood to make paper will inevitably require building more large factories. A paper mill with an annual output of 50,000 tons of wood raw materials requires more than 6,000 tons of steel, more than 10,000 kilowatts of electricity, and an investment of more than 100 million yuan, and it will take more than five years. Obviously, if only such large factories are built, local industries and commune industries cannot be built. On the contrary, using grass fiber can build more small and medium-sized factories. If 150 small factories with a daily output of two tons are built in one year, the annual paper production can reach 70,000 tons, and an investment of 10 to 20 million yuan will be enough. In this way, the grass resources distributed on vast land can be utilized, the enthusiasm of local and commune industries can be mobilized, and they can cooperate with the central industry and large-scale industry, "one leg", to accelerate the development speed of the paper industry.

In the production layout of light industry, we must first pay attention to implementing the policy of combining industry and agriculture, so that light industry is increasingly closely integrated with agriculture, cities and villages. Because light industry is generally an agricultural product processing industry, since most of the raw materials of light industry come from rural areas, and its products are mainly sold in rural areas, agricultural raw materials generally have the characteristics of large volume, easy deterioration, large processing volume, and most of the by-products are feed, fuel, and fertilizer needed by rural areas, which need to be returned in time. Therefore, it is necessary to build them in a decentralized manner and build more small and medium-sized factories, so that production is close to raw material and fuel production areas and consumption areas. This can not only save transportation, reduce product costs, and facilitate solving the difficulty of insufficient labor, greatly benefit the development of light industry production; but also promote the development of local economy, especially agricultural production. It also has positive and profound effects on the transition of rural people's communes from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism. Some comrades understand the issue of combining large, medium, and small and the issue of centralization and decentralization purely from a business perspective. This understanding is very incomplete.

Some comrades also believe that small factories are "technologically backward," "costly," and "of poor quality," while large factories are "technologically advanced," "low-cost," and "of high quality." Generally speaking, large factories do have certain advantages in technology, but small factories are close to raw material production areas, and by-products and power are easy to be comprehensively utilized. Rural wages are lower, and because buildings and equipment are simple, depreciation is also very low, seasonal production is very flexible, and reducing costs is entirely possible. As for quality, it also depends on human effort. China's famous Xuan paper, Mao Bian paper, wax paper, base paper, etc., are not made from wood pulp. The No. 1 offset printing paper produced by Hanyang Paper Mill in Hubei Province with 100% dragon's beard grass basically meets the requirements in terms of general physical properties and appearance. Jiangsu Paper Mill uses 100% rice straw as newsprint. Minfeng Paper Mill in Zhejiang Province mixes rice straw into cigarette paper. They all prove that grass fiber generally meets the quality requirements, has great potential, and is worth promoting. Of course, small factories and paper mills that use grass fiber are not flawless from the beginning. We need to strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, and constantly improve the production technology and management level of enterprises, and gradually improve the "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups." Managing small and medium-sized enterprises, local enterprises, commune-run industries, and enterprises that use coarse raw materials is of great significance for correctly implementing the construction line of greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

After ideological struggle, most cadres gradually reached a consensus on the understanding of the above-mentioned issues, and therefore achieved initial success in correctly implementing the Party Central Committee's policies. More than 700 small paper mills with a daily output of one to two tons using grass fiber as raw material have been established since last year; more than 80 sets of equipment for medium-sized paper mills with a daily output of ten tons have been manufactured this year; some large paper mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhu and other places have begun to contact the neighboring rural people's communes and established their own grass pulp production bases; the proportion of wood pulp in the total pulp production in the paper industry has decreased from occupying more than half to occupying one-quarter or one-fifth in the past ten years; on certain paper varieties in the paper industry that require a certain amount of wood, a large amount of substandard materials, bark, branches and other inferior materials have also been used in the selection of wood, eating more "coarse grains" and saving "fine grains". In the leather industry, the amount of pigskin used was 1.7 million sheets in 1953, and increased to 4.2 million sheets in 1958, accounting for about one-fifth of the total leather production. The products and output of ceramics replacing steel have also increased year by year. In the oil industry, the equipment capacity relocated from large cities to small and medium-sized towns over the years has reached more than 700,000 tons, and it continues to firmly adopt the policy of decentralized layout close to rural areas. More than 60% of the 350,000 tons of capacity of alcohol factories are "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups", and they were basically established last year.

Of course, this does not mean that light industry should not build large factories in the future. In cases where raw materials are abundant and concentrated, transportation is convenient, and it is economically and technically necessary, some large factories should still be built appropriately as the backbone. The complete set of policies of combining large, medium, and small, and simultaneously developing central industry and local industry is a complete policy. Understanding them in isolation is obviously harmful.

All this shows that the light industry sector, under the leadership of the Party, is resolutely implementing the Party's general line, and the practice of light industry development has proved and continues to prove the unparalleled correctness of the general line. However, at the same time, it proves that, in order to implement the Party's general line, struggle exists, and its main danger comes from the right, so it is necessary to constantly carry out the struggle against the right and encourage efforts. Some comrades have realized from their own personal experiences that as long as they leave the Party's line for a moment, they will make right-leaning conservative errors or other errors. Therefore, they have begun to realize the great significance of constantly studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works and thoughts, constantly going deep among the masses, connecting with reality, and thoroughly transforming our world outlook.

The current situation is very favorable for the further development of light industry. A vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy has been widely launched on the light industry front. Party committees at all levels are vigorously grasping the production of light industry, and a new production upsurge has been formed. All our light industry workers are determined to continue to forge ahead under the red banner of the general line, and strive to complete and overfulfill various planned targets for this year!

    轻工业在总路线光辉照耀下飞跃发展
    轻工业部部长　李烛尘
    当举国欢庆伟大的建国十周年的时候，我怀着无比的喜悦，同全体轻工业职工一道热烈欢呼祖国十年来在各个战线上的伟大成就，欢呼我们轻工业战线上的伟大成就。在这些欢乐的日子里，我们更加清楚地认识到：我们的自由幸福的新生活，我们的胜利，是六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的中国人民在中国共产党和英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，遵循着党所制定的总路线所取得的。轻工业十年来的成就，就是这个论断的证明。
    十年来我国轻工业生产获得迅速发展：产量大大增加，质量大大提高，并且试制成功和开始生产了大量新产品
    旧中国的轻工业是很落后的，技术水平低下，许多重要的原料不能自给，布局畸形地集中在沿海少数城市，大部分轻工业品要依靠进口。就是这个破烂摊子，帝国主义资本和官僚资本还是占了绝对优势，民族工业根本得不到发展。已有的企业由于帝国主义和官僚资本的掠夺，再加上长期战争的破坏，1949年解放时，轻工业产品和历史上最高年份产量比较，一般减少三分之一到二分之一。解放以后，轻工业和其他国民经济部门一样，进行了巨大的恢复工作。到1952年，轻工业主要产品就超过了解放前最高的年产量。第一个五年计划期间，轻工业部门坚定地执行了党对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造的方针，把生产力从旧的生产关系的束缚下解放出来。与此同时，又有重点地进行了基本建设，特别是发动群众提高劳动生产率，充分发挥了原有企业的潜力。围绕着这个中心，轻工业广大职工展开了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，如增产节约运动、技术革新运动、先进生产者和先进生产单位的运动等，使各行业的技术经济指标，都大大提高了。到1957年，绝大部分产品胜利完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划，五年内总产值增长了一倍多，平均每年增长17.1％。
    第二个五年计划的一开头，轻工业广大职工就坚定地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，结果，在1958年取得了空前的胜利。这一年，轻工业（按照四十一种主要产品计算）比1957年增长了40％，相当于过去五年每年增长速度的两倍多。1959年继续大跃进，轻工业计划总产值又比1958年增长30％，这个计划将可以超额完成。
    轻工业主要产品之一的原盐，1958年生产了一千零四十万吨，提前完成了原订第二个五年计划规定的1962年生产一千至一千一百万吨的任务。机制纸1958年生产了一百二十二万吨，1959年计划产量一百六十万吨，也将在今年内提前达到1962年的计划指标。
    各项轻工业产品在增加产量的同时，产品质量也大大地提高了。例如，一双球鞋在第一个五年计划初期只能穿着一百天左右，近两三年可以穿着一百六十至一百七十天；有一部分轻工业产品，如重庆长江牌手风琴，上海一百型英雄金笔、天津黄牛底面革、西安的搪瓷制品、太原的高级玻璃等，质量都接近或达到了国际先进水平。
    根据二十个行业的不完全统计，大跃进以来试制成功并开始生产的新产品有二千种左右。如造纸工业方面有电器工业、医疗器械、无线电传真、分析化验、农业育苗、国防工业、汽车工业、建筑工业以及高级包装使用的各种特种技术用纸和作人造丝的人造丝浆等等；陶瓷工业方面有耐酸泵、酒精塔等各种陶瓷器械；玻璃工业中有光学玻璃、人造宝石等；其他如照相机、黑白电影片、X光片、照相胶卷、钢化玻璃、玻璃纤维、中文电动打字机、手表、新型号的自来水笔、各种新品种罐头等等，都是我国工业历史上从来没有过的。
    轻工业基本建设方面也取得显著成就，不仅增加了新的生产能力，而且提高了内地和少数民族地区轻工业的比重
    轻工业基本建设方面，也是一个大跃进。
    第一个五年计划期间国家对轻工业的基本建设投资达十二点五亿元，平均每年二点五亿元，而1958年一年就达七亿元，1959年计划投资七点三亿元（不包括地方自筹）。恢复时期和第一个五年计划时期，机制纸新增能力共三十四点四万吨，而1958年就新增三十九万吨，一年超过过去八年，1959年将继续新增二十六万吨。食糖过去八年新增能力是六十三点三万吨，1958年、1959年两年就新增了七十九万吨。过去几年原盐新增能力一百四十四万吨，1958、1959两年就新增能力五百万吨。其他如酒精、硅酸盐、乳制品、油脂等行业的能力都有增加。
    基本建设不仅增加了新的生产能力，而且还产生了新的轻工业部门，增加了新的产品。例如造纸工业方面增加近二百三十种，开始改变了旧中国遗留下来的对各种高级用纸依赖进口的情况。造纸工业用的毛布、铜网、木浆，自来水笔用的赛璐珞、铱金，皮革工业用的鞣料、涂饰剂，啤酒工业用的麦芽、酒花等等，都由于进行了基本建设，也开始走向自给的道路。
    基本建设的另一个结果是使历史上遗留下来的集中在远离原料和销场的沿海大城市的不合理布局，开始得到调整，内地和少数民族区域轻工业的比重开始提高。
    在我国轻工业的建设过程中，一支轻工业技术队伍迅速成长壮大起来，能够独立设计许多新型的工厂，并掌握了许多新的生产技术。这是和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的无私援助分不开的。苏联以最新的技术装备帮助我们建设了近代化的佳木斯综合造纸厂，同时派遣了优秀的专家具体指导生产和设计、安装工作。民主德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家也帮助我国建立了一些轻工业工厂。我国和各兄弟国家都建立了技术合作的关系。
    轻工业生产的迅速发展，大大改善了人民的物质文化生活；有力地支援了其它工业部门
    十年来轻工业生产迅速发展，使人民的物质文化生活得到了很大改善。随着劳动人民的购买力不断提高，许多工业消费品再不是少数权贵才能享受到的东西。从1949年到1958年的九年中，广大人民对轻工业品的消费水平成倍地提高了。例如，食用植物油由1949年每人二点九市斤增长到六点二市斤，增长一倍；食糖同期由零点七市斤增长到三点三市斤，增长三点七倍；胶鞋由每百人五点一双增长到二十七点三双，增长四点四倍；纸张由每人零点七市斤增加到二点三市斤，增加二点三倍（不包括新闻、印刷用纸）；热水瓶由1952年每百人一点七八个增长到1958年五点三个，增长一点九倍；时钟1952年每千人零点三六个，1958年增长到三点九个，增长近十倍；自来水笔由每百人五点一支，增加到八点四支，增长65％。其他各种轻工业品也都有很大增长。
    轻工业的发展还起了支援和配合其他兄弟部门的作用。例如各种工业技术用纸、人造丝浆、各种工业用陶瓷和搪瓷、精馏酒精、高级甘油、原盐等，对支援其他工业和国防都起了重要的作用。
    轻工业大跃进的事实以及它所给国计民生带来的好处，证明了中国共产党中央和毛泽东主席所提出的党的社会主义建设总路线以及一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的，证明了党和毛主席对人民生活的改善是十分关切的。国内外敌对分子极力造谣污蔑，说什么：“中国搞重工业挤掉轻工业，牺牲了人民生活”，好像他们当真“关心”我国轻工业的发展和我国人民生活似的。实际这是一种可耻的挑拨伎俩，一种对我国全面大跃进的恐惧心理的暴露。轻工业十年来的成就，特别是大跃进以来的光辉成就，雄辩地证明了我国人民生活有很大的改善，今后将要有更大的改善。相反地，资本主义世界却是“日薄西山”，走着下坡路；它们那里的广大劳动人民生活的绝对贫困化是无可掩盖的事实。
    轻工业大跃进取得的重要经验
    一、开展技术革命、技术革新，厉行节约，增加生产
    轻工业大跃进取得了什么重要经验呢？主要有三条：第一，大搞技术革命、技术革新，厉行节约，增加生产；第二，大搞群众运动，实行两条腿走路；第三，也是最重要的一条，即加强党的领导，政治挂帅，不断反对右倾保守思想，为贯彻党的总路线而斗争。
    大跃进以来，轻工业大搞技术革命、技术革新的重点在于节约原材料，反对浪费，改进工具设备，提高劳动生产率。在造纸方面，进一步推广了草类纤维制浆以节约国家的木材资源。木浆占纸浆总产量的百分率在1949年达53％，1959年已经下降到22％。在已用木材中，也积极扩大材种，使用废料，大量用等外材、板皮、枝桠材、腐朽材以代替好木材。胶鞋工业通过合理的产品设计，采用炭黑大底、海绵底、微孔大底等等办法，1958年增产了三千万双，今年在国家核定的生胶量的基础上，又增产一千多万双。皮革工业积极推行猪皮制革，现在猪皮制革占到全部皮革的五分之一左右。日用金属制品改进产品设计，采用代用品，大大节约了好钢好铁，同时简化了工序，节约了劳动力。在陶瓷工业中，不少企业改用煤作燃料、部分改用煤气炉，每年为国家节约木材达五十至六十万立方米。玻璃工业大力推广半煤气熔炉代替直火式熔炉，每年节约煤达十万吨。陶瓷工业以陶代钢，据十四个省（市）统计，1958年生产的八十多种陶瓷工业设备，使国家节省了七万吨钢材。
    旧中国轻工业的底子差，手工操作占很大比重，劳动负荷很重，因此工人群众对改进工具、设备、实行机械化半机械化有着无比热情，仅造纸、制盐、陶瓷、玻璃、搪瓷五个行业在工具设备工艺等方面的重大革新项目就有七百多项。造纸工业在大跃进的头一年，就创造了一百多项先进技术经验，从备料、蒸煮、打浆、抄纸到成品包装的整个工艺过程都有革新，使生产效率提高20％到50％。玻璃工业正在推广自动吹瓶机，大大改善了工人的劳动条件，而且可以提高质量，增加产量。制盐工业大力推行机械化半机械化，节省了大量的劳力。
    二、大搞群众运动，贯彻实行两条腿走路的方针
    轻工业大搞技术革命所以取得很大成就，主要经验是解放思想，打破旧“皇历”，大搞群众运动，实行领导干部、群众、技术人员三结合。事实证明：工人群众和一部分技术人员对技术革新、技术革命有着无比热情。他们用不着像资本主义国家那样担心技术改革之后会丢掉饭碗。因此在我们的国家里，技术革命是有广泛的群众基础的。大跃进以来，正是一些普通工人、普通干部、普通技术员，在党的关怀和支持下，搞出了很多创造和发明。例如去年创制一台比原来用手工操作效率提高四十多倍的草纸制造机的，就是浙江省嘉善县人民造纸厂一个编草包的十六岁少年张瑞林。在造纸工业打浆工序上由间歇打浆变为连续打浆，提高工效15％到30％的，就是北京市燕京造纸厂的一个青年技术员和工人们一起在苏联经验的基础上大胆改革的结果。把人工吹瓶变为机器吹瓶的，是江苏省徐州市玻璃厂一个只有高小程度的二十一岁的工人蒋思让。这些事例充分说明劳动人民具有无穷的智慧；说明政治挂帅，充分发动群众，实行三结合，是技术革新、技术革命所以取得成就的主要经验，今后的技术革新、技术革命将继续证明和发展这些经验。
    去年以来，轻工业大办中小型工厂，大办人民公社工业，也是大搞群众运动的一个重要方面。
    轻工业的原料60％—70％来自农村，产品又主要销于农村，因此轻工业在农业原料增长的条件下，采取以中小型企业为主，土洋结合的方针，帮助人民公社大办工业，就成为十分必要。这样可以充分利用我国分散的资源，利用山区和边远地区的资源，可以减少往返运输和相向运输，可以减轻农村在农产品加工方面的负担，减轻妇女家务劳动的负担，可以最有效地调动人民公社和各省（区）市大办地方工业的积极性，使轻工业的布局趋向合理，从而收到多快好省的实际效果。
    党的八届六中全会指出：“人民公社必须大办工业”。1958年各级轻工业部门在党的领导下，在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，实行了中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大型企业与中小型企业同时并举的方针。现在全国人民公社的工厂已经成千上万，星罗棋布。只小型造纸厂去年一年就建成七百多个，每天可以生产约七百吨纸，今年上半年已经生产了一万多吨，下半年还可生产三、四万吨。十年来我国酒精工业的设备能力，机制部分不过十万吨，但去年采取了土洋结合、中小为主的方针，一年间就新增了二十五万吨能力。此外，在食糖、油脂、藤草竹木加工以及其他农产品加工方面，靠县社生产的比重都很大。我们的经验是：加强领导，全面规划；一切着眼于农业生产的发展和人民公社的巩固和发展，坚决使县社工业为农业生产服务，为大工业服务，为出口服务，为居民生活服务；在原料方面作好安排，保证国家的外调任务的顺利完成；不断地帮助县社工业实行经济核算制，提高产品质量，降低原材料消耗和生产成本，提高劳动生产率，改善经营管理，并使之适应农村的季节性生产；这样，就会有利于地方工业和社办工业的巩固与提高，为更大的发展提供有利条件。
    三、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，不断反对右倾保守思想
    实践证明，要在轻工业部门贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，坚决地不断地反对右倾保守思想。这方面，各级党委起了决定性的作用。
    几年来在轻工业发展问题上，曾经存在若干不同的认识。例如：在造纸工业上是以草类纤维为主，还是以木材为主；在皮革工业上是以猪皮为主，还是以牛皮为主；在设备机械制造上是只用钢铁，还是既用钢铁也用陶瓷和其他代用材料；在办厂规模上是办大厂为主，还是办中小厂为主；在工厂技术装备上是光办洋厂，还是“土洋结合”有“土”有“洋”等等。这些不同的认识，实质上反映了多快好省和少慢差费两条建设路线的斗争。在这个斗争中，我们正确地执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，使上述不同的认识得到了统一，在造纸工业中确定了以草类纤维为主的发展方针；在皮革工业确定了以猪皮为主的发展方针；在设备机械制造上，既要用钢铁也要大量利用陶瓷等非金属材料；在办厂的规模上是大中小相结合，以中小为主；在工厂的技术装备上是土洋并举，由土到洋等。这样就保证了轻工业的迅速发展。
    在两条建设路线的斗争中，具有代表性的是造纸工业以草类纤维为主还是以木材为主之间的斗争。几年来不少同志认为只有木浆才能制造好纸，他们迷信木浆，轻视草浆，不愿意去了解我国木材蓄积量和采伐情况。虽然我国森林采伐量逐年增加，造林事业逐年发展，但是各方面建设对木材需要量也不断增长了。在这样情况下，我们还是等着国家分配造纸木材，还是采用草类纤维造纸呢？采用前一个方针，势必延缓造纸工业的发展速度，反之采用草类纤维，（这里包括苇子、甘蔗渣、稻草、麦秆、大豆秆、高粱秆、棉秆、龙须草、马连草、胡麻秆等等）那么就将取之不尽，用之不竭，就将大大加速我国造纸工业的发展。
    采用木材造纸，势必要多办大厂。一个年产五万吨的木材原料的纸厂，需用钢铁在六千吨以上，需用电力在一万瓩以上，投资在一亿元以上，时间要五年以上。显然，如果只办这样的大厂，地方工业、公社工业就办不起。反之，采用草类纤维，就可多办中、小型工厂，如果一年办日产二吨小厂一百五十个，年产纸可达七万吨，投资一、二千万元就够。这样分布在广阔土地上的草类资源就可能被利用，地方和公社工业的积极性就能够调度起来，就可以配合中央工业和大型工业这“一条腿”，加速造纸工业的发展速度。
    在轻工业的生产布局上，首先必须注意贯彻执行工农业并举的方针，使轻工业同农业、城市同乡村日益紧密地结合起来。因为，轻工业一般为农产品加工工业，既然轻工业的原料大部分来自农村，产品主要销于农村，农产原料一般又具有体积大、易变质、加工用量大，下脚大都是农村所需的饲料、燃料和肥料，需要及时返回等特点，因而必须分散建设，多办中小型工厂，使生产接近于原料、燃料产地和消费地区，这不仅可以节省运输力，降低产品成本，便于解决劳动力不足的困难，大大地有利于轻工业生产的发展；而且可以促进当地经济，特别是农业生产的发展。并且对农村人民公社从集体所有制向全民所有制过渡和从社会主义向共产主义过渡，也都有积极而深刻的作用。有些同志单纯从业务的角度来理解大中小并举的问题和集中与分散的问题，这个认识是很不完全的。
    还有的同志认为小厂“技术落后”、“成本高”、“质量差”，大厂“技术先进”、“成本低”、“质量高”。一般地说，大厂诚然在技术方面具有一定的优越性，但小厂靠近原料产地，下脚和动力便于综合利用，农村工资较低，由于建筑物设备简单，折旧费也很低，季节性生产，灵活性很大，降低成本是完全可能的。至于质量也事在人为，我国有名的宣纸、毛边纸、腊纸、原纸等等，就不是木浆做原料的。湖北省汉阳纸厂用百分之百的龙须草生产的一号胶版印刷纸，一般物理性能和外观基本上符合要求，江苏造纸厂利用百分之百的稻草作新闻纸，浙江民丰纸厂掺用稻草作卷烟纸，都证明草类纤维一般可以符合质量要求，大有可为，值得推广。当然小厂和用草类纤维的纸厂并不是一开始生产就毫无瑕隙的，需要我们加强领导，依靠群众，不断地提高企业的生产技术和管理水平，把“小土群”逐步提高为“小洋群”。把中小企业、地方企业、社办工业、使用粗原料的企业管好，对于正确地贯彻多快好省的建设路线具有重大意义。
    经过思想斗争，多数干部对上述各个问题的认识逐步达到一致，因而在正确贯彻党中央的方针政策上取得了初步成就。利用草类纤维做原料的日产一至二吨的小纸厂，去年以来兴办了七百多个；日产十吨的中型纸厂的设备今年制造了八十多台；上海、天津、芜湖等地有些大型纸厂都开始和邻近的农村人民公社联系并建立了自己的草浆生产基地；造纸工业中木浆占纸浆总产量的比率十年间由占用一半以上降到占用四分之一或五分之一；造纸工业上某些必需使用一定数量木材的纸张品种，在选用木材上，也大量采用了等外材、板皮、枝桠材等次劣材，多吃“粗粮”，节约“细粮”。在皮革工业中，猪皮用量1953年是一百七十万张，1958年上升到四百二十万张，占制革总量的五分之一左右。以陶代钢的产品和产量逐年也有所增长。油脂工业中历年从大城市迁到中小城镇的设备能力达七十多万吨，而且继续坚定地采取分散布局接近农村的方针。酒精厂三十五万吨能力中有60％以上是“小土群”和“小洋群”，而且基本上是去年兴办起来的。
    当然，这并不是说轻工业以后再不应该办大厂了。在原料丰富而集中、交通方便、经济技术上十分必要的情况下，仍应该适当举办些大厂，作为骨干。大中小并举，中央工业与地方工业并举一整套的方针是完整的方针，把它们孤立地来理解，显然是有害的。
    这一切说明，轻工业部门在党的领导下，是坚决执行党的总路线的，从轻工业发展的实践中已经证明和继续证明总路线的无比正确性。但是，同时又证明了，为着贯彻党的总路线，斗争是存在的，其主要的危险又是来自右的方面，因此必须经常地进行反右倾、鼓干劲的斗争。有些同志已经从自己切身的经历中体会到，只要须臾地离开了党的路线，就会犯右倾保守的错误或其它错误，因此已经开始觉悟到经常地学习毛泽东主席的著作和思想，经常地深入群众、联系实际，彻底地改造我们的世界观的重大意义。
    目前形势对轻工业的进一步发展十分有利，一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动已经在轻工业战线上广泛地开展起来了。各级党委正在大抓轻工业的生产，一个新的生产高潮已经形成。我们轻工业全体职工决心在总路线的红旗下，继续奋勇前进，为完成和超额完成今年的各项计划指标而奋斗！（附图片）
