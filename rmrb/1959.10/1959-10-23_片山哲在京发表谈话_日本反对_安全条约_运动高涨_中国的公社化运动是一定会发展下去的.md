Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd -- Katayama Tetsu, head of the Japanese delegation celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, told our reporter today that China's people's commune movement has not only greatly improved the level of production, but has also improved the lives of the people.

Katayama Tetsu and the delegation he led visited various parts of China extensively after participating in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. He said that China's economic development and large-scale construction work are amazing. We have personally seen the power of the Chinese people. I firmly believe that the people's commune movement will definitely continue to develop in China.

He also said: "We visitors from Japan are deeply convinced from our visit that China is a peace-loving country, especially that China is willing to coexist peacefully with Japan."

Speaking of the joint statement signed yesterday by the Japanese delegation celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and seven Chinese organizations, Katayama Tetsu said that this statement will help develop non-governmental exchanges and cultural exchange between China and Japan, as well as friendly relations between China and Japan.

He said that the strong anti-Japan-U.S. Security Treaty movement and anti-military base movement in Japan are rising. This is a force that cannot be ignored.

Katayama Tetsu said that the majority of the Japanese people are concerned about the current deadlock between Japan and China. However, the attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government has created many difficulties in breaking this deadlock. We will do everything we can to make efforts to normalize relations between Japan and China as soon as possible.

The delegation led by Katayama Tetsu will leave Beijing on the 24th to return home. Katayama Tetsu said that he hopes that after returning to Japan, through the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association he leads, he will send more representatives of Japanese non-governmental organizations, including Japanese theater groups, writers, and musicians, to China for friendly visits.

    片山哲在京发表谈话
    日本反对“安全条约”运动高涨
    中国的公社化运动是一定会发展下去的
    新华社22日讯　日本各界庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年代表团团长片山哲今天对本社记者说，中国的人民公社化运动不仅大大提高了生产水平，而且使人民的生活也有了提高。
    片山哲和他率领的代表团在北京参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝典礼后曾到中国各地进行了广泛的参观访问。他说，中国的经济发展和规模巨大的建设工作是惊人的。我们亲眼看到中国人民群众的力量。我深信人民公社化运动在中国是一定会发展下去的。
    他还说：“我们从日本来的参观者，从访问中深信中国是一个爱好和平的国家，特别是中国是愿意和日本和平共处的。”
    在谈到昨天签字的日本各界庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年代表团和我国七个团体的共同声明时，片山哲说，这个声明将有助于发展中日两国之间的民间来往和文化交流，以及中日两国的亲善友好关系。
    他说，日本国内的强有力的反对日美安全保障条约运动和反对军事基地运动正在日益高涨。这是一个不可忽视的力量。
    片山哲说，日本大多数人民对日中两国之间目前存在的僵局表示关心。但是岸信介政府的态度使打开这个局面遭到了不少困难。我们将尽一切力量来进行努力使日中两国关系早日正常化。
    片山哲所率领的代表团将在24日离开北京回国。片山哲说，他希望在回国后，通过他所领导的日中文化交流协会以及日中友好协会，更多派遣一些日本民间团体的代表，包括日本剧团、文学家、音乐家来中国进行友好访问。
