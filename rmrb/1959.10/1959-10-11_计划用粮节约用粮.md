　　The current situation on the national grain front is very good. The main signs are that grain production has increased, and the conservation of grain has attracted more attention from the masses. This year, many regions suffered from severe natural disasters. However, thanks to the full utilization of the superiority of the people's communes, the disasters were overcome. Due to the great call for anti-rightist sentiment and increased efforts put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a new upsurge in agricultural production has been set off. This year, the total grain output in the country will increase even more than in 1958, which was a year of bumper harvest. At the same time, among the urban and rural people, especially in the vast rural areas, a nationwide campaign to conserve grain is being carried out, and the spirit of planned use of grain and economical use of grain is being implemented among the masses.
    The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching a movement to increase production and practice economy pointed out that for grain and other consumer goods that are not yet abundant in supply, it is necessary to promote thrift among all residents and overcome waste. Why is it necessary to advocate saving grain when grain production has increased so greatly? This is because: First, although grain production has increased, our country's past foundation was weak, and the current level of production is still low. The average amount of grain possessed by each person is not high, and the country's grain reserves and the grain reserves in the hands of the masses are still relatively weak. Second, although our country's ability to resist disasters has greatly increased compared to before liberation, it still cannot completely get rid of the impact of natural disasters for the time being or for a considerable period. In order to guard against possible crop failures, it is absolutely necessary to strive to increase grain reserves as much as possible in years of good harvests. This year, many areas have suffered from natural disasters, and all localities should pay more attention to saving grain. Third, while grain production is rapidly increasing, the need for grain in all aspects is also growing rapidly with the high-speed development of the national economy. For example, in order to support the development of industry, the grain supply in cities and industrial and mining areas needs to be gradually increased; in order to develop animal husbandry, increase the power and fertilizer in rural areas, and increase the people's meat consumption, it is necessary to increase a portion of feed; at the same time, the personnel of projects and enterprises run by the people's communes also need a portion of grain. Due to the above reasons, even though grain production has increased, we must still use grain carefully and prevent waste.
    Saving grain does not mean lowering people's necessary rations, but making planned arrangements on the basis of ensuring the basic needs of the people, so as to achieve rational use. Grain is a multi-faceted need and an extremely important material. In addition to the part left for local farmers to eat in grain-producing areas, it is also necessary to supply grain to economic crop areas, forest areas, pastoral areas, fishing areas, salt areas, and severely affected areas, and it is necessary to supply grain to cities and industrial and mining areas. In addition to being mainly used for food, a portion of the grain must be kept for seeds, used as feed, and supplied for the needs of some industrial production. In order to ensure the rational needs of all aspects, it is necessary to distribute grain in a planned way. Grain is both a seasonal production and a perennial consumption material. Most areas in our country produce one or two seasons of grain each year, while people need grain every day throughout the year in their lives. In order to ensure that the grain produced seasonally can guarantee the needs of the whole year, and in order to prevent the uneven phenomenon of grain consumption, with more at one time and less at another, and more in autumn and winter and insufficient in spring and summer, grain should also be used in a planned way. Using grain in a planned way can lay the foundation for saving grain and prevent waste of grain.
    Based on the experience of carrying out planned use of grain and economical use of grain in some areas last year and this summer, and based on the current situation in various places, we believe that the following three points are worth paying attention to.
    First, the economical use of grain must be grasped early and tightly. The phenomenon of wasting grain often emerges immediately after the harvest of crops, and even more so in the case of a bumper harvest. Grasping the work of conservation at the very beginning, carrying out publicity and guidance early, can lay the foundation for saving grain for the year. Conversely, if you relax at the beginning, it will be difficult to tighten it up again in the middle. As the saying goes: "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality"; "Save on the top of the granary, not on the bottom of the granary," which is exactly what it means. This is true from the perspective of a commune, a management area, a production team, a public canteen, and a household, and it is also true from the perspective of the whole country. At present, the autumn harvest is about to end in most areas. This is an important time to vigorously publicize and begin to implement planned use of grain and economical use of grain. We must firmly seize this opportunity, arrange unified sales while carrying out unified purchases, and arrange grain use plans while carrying out distribution. It is better to grasp it early than to grasp it late. Now is the beginning of the grain year. We must immediately implement the spirit of conservation in order to achieve "a tighter autumn and winter, and a better spring and summer."
    Second, vigorously increasing the production of vegetables and increasing the variety of non-staple foods and substitutes are also important ways to save grain. There are many ways to produce non-staple foods and substitutes, such as growing vegetables, raising pigs, raising sheep, fishing, hunting, and collecting wild vegetables. The most important of these is to increase vegetable production. Vegetables are the main non-staple food of the Chinese people. More vegetables can regulate the diet, save grain, and benefit health. In some places, such as some grain-producing areas in the Northwest and North China, there were too few vegetables in the past. After active promotion, people now eat more vegetables, there are more varieties of food, grain is saved, and people's health has also improved. Autumn vegetables account for a large proportion of vegetable production throughout the year. In many areas, "eating vegetables in winter and spring depends on one autumn." At present, all localities should earnestly do a good job in the field management of autumn vegetables and strive to increase the yield per unit area of autumn vegetables. The area planted with autumn vegetables this year has been greatly expanded compared to last year. According to statistics from sixty-three cities in the north, it has increased by more than two-thirds compared to last year.
　　This is a very good thing. However, a large part of the vegetable fields this year are new vegetable fields. Therefore, we should seize the opportunity to do a good job in irrigation, topdressing, weeding, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area of autumn vegetables. In areas in the south where the climate still allows for the sowing of winter vegetables, we should start immediately and plant as many vegetables as possible. In addition to arable land, vegetable planting should also make full use of scattered land such as fields and field ridges to expand the planting area. Vegetables are also seasonal production and perennial consumption crops. In addition to a small portion that is eaten at the time, most of them must be dried or pickled for later use. Therefore, public canteens, the catering industry, and non-staple food stores should try their best to pickle and store some vegetables. At the same time, they should widely mobilize the masses to make full use of civilian equipment and family auxiliary labor to enable every household to pickle and store a certain amount of vegetables as much as possible.
    Third, carry out extensive publicity and mobilize the masses. Grain is needed by everyone and every day. Therefore, saving grain must also mobilize the masses so that everyone pays attention and pays attention every day. The reason why grain saving work has been done relatively well in many areas is because they have explained the truth to the masses and widely mobilized the masses. After the wheat and early rice harvest this year, some areas launched a concentrated publicity campaign, and some areas conducted meticulous political and ideological work from within the Party to outside the Party. These areas improved the awareness of the masses through methods such as recalling comparisons, typical demonstrations, and calculating grain accounts, so that the Party's call for saving grain truly became a household name. Many canteens and families automatically formulated plans for saving grain, and saving grain became a social trend. In terms of food, methods such as combining coarse and fine grains, adjusting dry and thin foods, differentiating between busy and idle times, and setting rations according to people's needs have been implemented, so that people can eat enough and eat well, save grain, and prevent waste. All localities should do this after the autumn harvest. Facts have proved that once the idea of diligence and frugality is grasped by the broad masses, it will immediately take effect and turn into a huge material force.
    We hope that all localities will further deepen the movement to save grain. We hope that all localities will promptly summarize and universally promote the experience of relying on the masses to do a good job in saving grain. For the behavior of wasting grain that has begun to appear in some units, it should be criticized and corrected at any time. Grain should be saved in bumper harvest areas, and grain should also be saved in general areas and disaster-stricken areas. Grain should be saved in cities, and grain should also be saved in rural areas. Saving grain is not a passive measure, but an active measure; it is not to reduce the necessary rations of the people, but to use them rationally, eliminate waste, and better guarantee the regular needs of the people. The more grain reserves, the better the living arrangements, and the greater the enthusiasm of the people for production. We believe that as long as we are good at planning, careful calculations, diligence and thrift, the cause of socialist construction will inevitably develop forward at a faster speed, and the people of the whole country will be able to realize a better life step by step on the basis of rapid production improvement.

### 计划用粮节约用粮

　　计划用粮节约用粮
    目前全国粮食战线形势很好。主要的标志是粮食生产增长了；粮食的节约也更加引起广大群众的注意。今年许多地区遭受到严重的自然灾害，但是，由于充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，战胜了灾害；由于党的八届八中全会提出的反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召，掀起了农业增产的新高潮，今年全国的粮食总产量比特大丰收的1958年还会增加。同时，在城乡人民中，特别是在广大农村中，正开展着全民性的节约用粮运动，计划用粮、节约用粮的精神正在贯彻到广大群众中去。
    党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议中指出，对于粮食和其他供应还不算富裕的消费品，一定要在一切居民中提倡节约，克服浪费。为什么粮食的生产已经大大增长了，还要提倡节约粮食呢？这是因为：第一，尽管粮食的产量增加了，但是我们国家过去的底子很薄、基础很差，目前的生产水平仍然是低的，每一个人平均占有的粮食数量还不算多，国家的粮食储备和群众手中的粮食储备也还比较薄弱。第二，我国农业的抗灾能力虽然比起解放以前已经有了很大的增强，但是目前以至在一个相当的时期内，还不能完全摆脱自然灾害的影响。为了防备可能发生的歉收，在丰收的年份中力争多增加一些粮食储备，是完全必要的。今年许多地区遭受了自然灾害，各地更应当注意节约粮食。第三，在粮食产量迅速增加的同时，随着国民经济的高速度发展，各方面对粮食的需要也在迅速增长。例如：为了支援工业的发展，城市和工矿区的粮食供应需要逐步增加；为了发展畜牧业，以增加农村的动力和肥料，增加人民的肉食，需要增加一部分饲料；同时，人民公社兴办的工程和企业的人员，也需要一部分粮食。由于以上种种原因，尽管粮食增产了，我们使用粮食仍然必须精打细算，防止浪费。
    节约粮食，并不是降低人们必要的口粮，而是在保证人民基本需要的基础上，有计划地进行安排，作到合理使用。粮食是多方面需要的、极其重要的物资。除了产粮地区留作当地农民食用的部分以外，还必须供应经济作物区、林区、牧区、渔区、盐区以及重灾区的吃粮，必须供应城市和工矿区的吃粮。粮食除了主要用于食用以外，还必须有一部分留作种籽、用作饲料和供应一些工业生产的需要。为了保证各方面的合理需要，就必须有计划地分配粮食。粮食既是季节性生产又是常年消费的物资，我国大多数地区每年生产一季或两季粮食，而人们生活中却是一年到头，天天需要粮食。为了使季节性生产的粮食能够保证全年的需用，为了使粮食消费不发生一时多一时少、秋冬过多春夏不足的不均衡现象，也应当有计划地使用粮食。有计划地使用粮食，才能为节约粮食打下基础，才能防止粮食的浪费。
    根据去年和今年夏天有些地区开展计划用粮、节约用粮工作的经验，根据目前各地的情况，我们认为有以下三点是值得提起注意的。
    第一，节约用粮要抓得早、抓得紧。浪费粮食的现象，往往在农作物收获以后马上就会冒头，在丰收的情况下更是这样。一开头就抓紧节约工作，及早进行宣传和指导，就可以为一年节约用粮打下基础。反之，如果一开头就放松了，中途再收紧就有困难。俗话说：“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难”；“要省在囤顶上，不要省在囤底上”，正是这个意思。从一个公社、一个管理区、一个生产队、一个公共食堂和一家一户来说是如此，从全国来说也是如此。目前大部分地区秋收快要结束，这是大力宣传和开始实行计划用粮、节约用粮的重要时机。必须紧紧地抓住这个时机，在进行统购的同时就安排统销，在进行分配的同时就安排用粮计划。迟抓不如早抓，现在正是粮食年度开始的时候，必须立即贯彻节约精神，以便做到“秋冬紧一些，春夏就好过”。
    第二，大力增加蔬菜的产量，增加各种副食品和代食品，也是节约粮食的一个重要方法。生产副食品和代食品的门路很多，如种菜、养猪、养羊、捕鱼、打猎、采野菜等等。其中首要的是增产蔬菜。蔬菜是我国人民主要的副食品，蔬菜多了，就可以调剂伙食，节约粮食，而且有益健康。有些地方，例如西北和华北的某些产粮区，过去蔬菜过少，经过积极提倡，现在吃菜多了，伙食的花样多了，粮食节省了，人们的健康也增进了。秋菜在全年蔬菜生产中占很大比重，许多地区是“冬春吃菜靠一秋”。当前各地应当切实作好秋菜的田间管理，努力增产秋菜。今年种植秋菜的面积比去年扩大很多，据北方六十三个城市统计，比去年增加三分之二以上。
　　这是一件很好的事情。但是，今年的菜地有很大一部分是新菜地，因此更应当抓紧时机，做好灌溉、追肥、锄草、防治病虫害等工作，千方百计地提高秋菜的单位面积产量。在南方气候条件还允许播种冬菜的地区，应当立即动手，尽可能多种一些蔬菜。种植蔬菜，除了耕地以外，还要充分利用田边、地埂等零星土地，以扩大种植面积。蔬菜也是季节生产、常年消费的作物，除了一小部分当时食用以外，绝大部分都要晒干或腌制，留备后用。因此，公共食堂、饮食业、副食品商店应当尽量腌晒储存一些蔬菜，同时还要广泛发动群众，充分利用民间的设备和家庭的辅助劳动力，使家家户户都尽可能腌晒储存一定数量的蔬菜。
    第三，广泛宣传，发动群众。粮食是人人需要、天天需要的，因此，节约粮食也必须发动群众，使人人注意、天天注意。许多地区粮食节约工作所以做得比较好，就是因为向群众讲清了道理，广泛地发动了群众。在今年小麦和早稻收获以后，有的地区展开了突击宣传运动，有的地区从党内到党外进行了细致的政治思想工作。这些地区通过回忆对比、典型示范和算粮食账等等方法，提高了群众的觉悟，使党的节约粮食的号召真正做到家喻户晓，许多食堂和家庭自动订立了节约用粮计划，节约粮食就形成了社会风气。在伙食上实行了粗细搭配，干稀调剂，忙闲有别，按人定量，节余归己等办法，既吃得饱、又吃得好，节约了粮食，防止了浪费。秋收以后，各地都应当这样做。事实证明，勤俭节约的思想一经为广大群众所掌握，就会立见功效，变成巨大的物质力量。
    我们希望，各地把节约用粮运动进一步深入地开展下去。对于依靠群众做好节约粮食工作的经验，希望各地及时加以总结，普遍推广。对于某些单位开始出现的浪费粮食的行为，应当随时批判和纠正。在丰收地区要节约用粮，在一般地区和受灾地区也要节约用粮。在城市要节约用粮，在乡村也要节约用粮。节约用粮不是消极的措施，而是积极的措施；不是要求减少人民必要的口粮，而是要求合理使用，杜绝浪费，更好地保证人民的经常需要。粮食的储备更多，生活的安排更好，人们生产的劲头也就更足更大。我们相信，只要善于安排，精打细算，克勤克俭，社会主义建设事业必然会以更快的速度向前发展，全国人民也就能够在生产迅速提高的基础上，一步一步地实现更加美好的生活。
