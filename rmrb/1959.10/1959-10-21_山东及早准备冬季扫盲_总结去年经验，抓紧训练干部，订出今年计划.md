Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th - Inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, educational administrative departments and grassroots cultural and educational units in Shandong are vigorously opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, seizing the current excellent situation, and actively making various preparations for launching a winter literacy upsurge. By the end of September, more than 2,520,000 people across the province had participated in literacy and spare-time learning, including more than 1,860,000 new literacy students, an increase of more than 50% compared to before the public announcement of the Eighth Plenary Session.

The characteristics of this year's winter literacy preparation work are early action and good grasp. Leaders at all levels have great enthusiasm and are launching mass movements in conjunction with autumn production. Due to the strengthening of Party leadership and effective measures, it has been quickly implemented at the grassroots level. In September, all regions successively held a series of meetings from education sections and bureaus to the vast number of grassroots cultural and educational cadres and people-run school teachers to study and deploy literacy and spare-time education work. Through studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, these meetings spoke highly of the current excellent situation in industrial and agricultural production, summarized experiences, affirmed achievements, and at the same time, profoundly examined and criticized the right-leaning thoughts that had existed among some cadres. The Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, at a ten-day literacy professional cadre meeting in the entire area attended by more than 470 people, conscientiously summarized the achievements and experiences of literacy work since last year. In 1958, this region eliminated illiteracy for more than 340,000 people, exceeding the total number of people made literate in the previous eight years. Before September of this year, more than 570,000 people continued to persist in literacy learning, and more than 70,000 people graduated from literacy classes, which is a greater achievement than the entire year of 1957. Faced with these facts, some skeptics were left speechless. At this meeting, red flags were also inserted and pacesetters were established, which greatly inspired and educated the attendees. Wulian County, which had held 32 on-site literacy meetings, convened a county-wide broadcast conference after the Eighth Plenary Session, and the number of new literacy students quickly increased from more than 27,000 to more than 47,000, accounting for more than 80% of the number of people who should participate in literacy learning.

In terms of specific preparatory work, all regions have grasped the rectification of grassroots literacy organizations and literacy teams. Most regions have trained literacy cadres. In the Changwei Special District, literacy leading groups or cultural and educational committees have been established in most communes and production teams, and each commune and production team has assigned special personnel to manage literacy work. Replacements for vacant people-run school teachers have also been selected and equipped. The Changwei Special District has now selected and equipped more than 41,000 people-run school teachers. Fan County has adopted a four-pronged approach of fixing, returning, promoting, and supplementing to equip more than 8,680 head teacher in people-run schools, and nearly 20,000 tutorial people-run school teachers. Some regions have also trained the newly selected people-run school teachers.

The work of investigating the current state of illiteracy, cultivating models, and summarizing experiences is underway in various regions. Zouping County has also ranked all young and middle-aged people, compiled classes and groups, and achieved three determinations: determining personnel, determining classes and groups, and determining teachers, and posting them publicly, so that everyone knows the situation.

Regarding the literacy plan for this winter and next spring, preparations have begun. Many places have proposed that all illiterate people who can enroll should enroll, run spare-time primary schools in a big way, and actively develop spare-time secondary schools. It is expected that an upsurge of literacy learning will be launched across the province in early November.

    山东及早准备冬季扫盲
    总结去年经验，抓紧训练干部，订出今年计划
    据新华社济南20日电　在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，山东各地教育行政部门与广大基层文教单位正在大力反右倾、鼓干劲，抓住当前大好形势，为掀起冬季扫盲高潮积极进行各种准备。到9月底止，全省参加扫盲与业余学习的已达二百五十二万多人，其中扫盲入学人数一百八十六万多人，比八中全会公报公布前增加了50％以上。
    今年冬季扫盲准备工作的特点是抓的早，抓的好。各级领导干劲大，结合秋季生产大搞群众运动。由于加强了党的领导，措施有力，已很快贯彻到基层。各地区在9月份都先后召开了由教育科、局到广大基层文教干部和民校教师的一系列会议，研究与部署扫盲和业余教育工作。这些会议通过学习八中全会文件，大讲当前工农业生产的大好形势，总结经验，肯定成绩，同时，深刻地检查与批判了曾在一部分干部中存在的右倾思想。聊城专署在全区为期十天、四百七十多人参加的扫盲专业干部会议上，认真总结了去年以来扫盲工作的成绩与经验。这个地区1958年共扫除文盲三十四万多人，超过以前八年扫除文盲数的总和；今年9月以前仍有五十七万多人坚持扫盲学习，并有七万多人扫盲毕业，比1957年全年扫盲成绩还大。在这些事实面前，一些怀疑论者都闭口无言。在这个会议上还插了红旗、树立了标兵，使到会人员受到很大的启发教育，先后开过三十二次扫盲现场会议的五莲县，在八中全会后，召开了全县广播大会，扫盲入学人数迅速由二万七千多人增加到四万七千多人，占应参加扫盲学习人数的80％以上。
    在具体准备工作上，各地都抓紧了基层扫盲组织与扫盲队伍的整顿工作。各地区对扫盲干部大都进行了训练。昌潍专区各县在绝大部分公社和生产队内建立了扫盲领导小组或文教委员会，各公社和生产队都有专人分工管理扫盲工作。缺额民校教师也进行了选拔配备，昌潍专区现已选拔配备民校教师四万一千多人，范县采取固定、归队、提拔、补选四结合的办法，配备主讲民校教师八千六百八十多人，辅导民校教师将近二万人。对新选拔的民校教师有些地区还进行了训练。
    调查现有文盲状况，培养典型，总结经验的工作，各地正在进行。邹平县还对所有青壮年进行了排队，编班划组，作到三定：定人员，定班组、定教师，并张榜公布，使每个人心中有数。
    关于今冬明春的扫盲计划，已着手制订。不少地方提出：能入学的文盲全部入学，大办业余小学，积极发展业余中学。全省预计在11月上旬即可掀起扫盲学习高潮。
