Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st: Sichuan Province has selected 432 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers to attend the National "Meeting of Heroes."

　　Among the delegates are the Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory, an advanced collective that completed its annual state plan more than three months ahead of schedule; Huang Rongchang, who transformed from an ordinary carpenter into a mechanical engineer and became the deputy director of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's converter steelmaking plant; Wei Gaohou, an innovation expert from the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory; and Huang Changhua, the captain of the Nantong Coal Mine's hydraulic mining team. They include workers, engineering and technical personnel, political work cadres, administrative cadres, and service personnel. Due to the rapid industrial development in minority areas, the number of representatives has significantly increased.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward, mass movements on Sichuan Province's industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts have surged, and heroes have emerged. In the first half of this year alone, the province saw more than 340,000 advanced producers and more than 20,000 advanced collectives. These advanced collectives and individuals, nurtured by the Party, generally possess a communist spirit of despising difficulties and daring to think and act. For example, in order to realize transportation mechanization, Huang Rongchang designed and created fifteen large machines and equipment such as gantry cranes, magnetic cranes, and large riverside double-arm cranes last year. When he first designed large-scale automated transportation equipment, some engineering and technical personnel said that his design was not in the books and lacked theoretical basis. Huang Rongchang said: "It is precisely because it is not in the books that we must create it. After it is created, it will be in the books." Wang Yuei of Chongqing Stationery Factory, in order to trial-produce "Hongyan" high-grade blue-black ink, worked hard and persevered, experimenting 4,134 times in three years and four months, and finally succeeded on the 4,135th attempt.

　　Advanced helping the backward, and common leaps forward, is also their characteristic. Tian Jingqi, an advanced producer at the Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory who has already surpassed 1962's production level, not only helped all 24 workers in his group complete their 1960 workload ahead of schedule, but also went to the Chengdu Electric Motor Factory six times to help the factory's workers improve their operating methods, increasing the output of the factory's lathe workshop by 40%. Pang Renying, an advanced producer at the Chengdu Radio Factory, was transferred to weaker groups by the factory three times to help these groups become advanced production groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st: Henan Province has selected 99 advanced producers and 113 advanced collectives to attend the National "Meeting of Heroes," and has invited 26 special representatives from science, education, culture, health, and community-run industries.

　　This year in Henan Province, over 18,000 advanced collectives and over 313,000 model individuals have emerged in the socialist labor competition. Among their representatives are Chen Shihe, a technician from the Anyang Iron and Steel Company's hydrometallurgical iron smelting plant, who actively innovated technology and created advanced experiences such as uninterrupted air supply during wind pipe combustion, steam ash removal, and uninterrupted air supply during post-flue combustion ash removal, enabling the blast furnace to maintain long life and high yield; Wang Benzhen, a fitter from the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, who has created and improved 595 kinds of tools in the past five years, including 25 with higher efficiency, which, if calculated according to production quotas and efficiency improvement multiples, can complete 76 years of work in one year; and Zhang Jiying, a national type-setting expert, who worked hard to improve operations and created an amazing achievement of type-setting 6,658 characters per hour.

　　These advanced producers not only pay attention to improving output, but also pay great attention to quality, safety, and conservation. For example, Xu Wujiang, the driver of locomotive 4005 of the Luoyang Locomotive Depot, achieved a safe driving distance of one million kilometers in mid-September due to his constant attention to the maintenance of the locomotive. Kong Qingjin, a model pig escort and advanced worker representative of the Luohe City financial and trade department, escorted more than 15,000 pigs over three and a half years, traveling more than 154,000 li, without any deaths or losses, and reduced losses by 2.5% compared to the quota, saving the state more than 37,300 yuan. Xu Quanren, a 66-year-old grain custodian, is a veteran hero who went through the 25,000-li Long March. He loves the revolutionary cause and has created the outstanding achievement of keeping 800,000 jin of grain for three years without mildewing, discoloration, or deterioration. Now he has proposed a guarantee of not allowing a single grain to mildew for ten years.

　　Among the advanced collectives are the small blast furnace of the Xinxiang City Iron and Steel Factory, which has a utilization coefficient of over 2 and a qualified pig iron rate of 100%; the Liu Jiuxue coal mining team of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, which has had safe production for ten years; and the No. 1 group of the fine yarn class of Zhengzhou No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, which has overfulfilled its production tasks every year for the past five years. There is also the No. 1 Motor Transport Team of Xuchang Highway Transportation Company, which has continuously achieved a vehicle-ton monthly output of 10,000 tons per kilometer for seven consecutive months; the Pingdingshan Haotang Coal Mine, which completed a pair of large-scale mine shafts sixteen months ahead of schedule; and the Yellow River Survey and Design Working Group, which overcame numerous difficulties and completed its annual plan three months ahead of schedule.

　　These advanced individuals and advanced collectives also have a common characteristic, which is that they all promote the spirit of advanced helping the backward, learning from each other, and improving together. For example, the Zhao Guangrong advanced tunneling team of Guanyintang Coal Mine specifically assigned veteran technicians to help the Li Shiqing group improve their skills, enabling the Li Shiqing group to catch up with them within half a month. Labor model Liu Qunzhang helped more than 30 people improve their tools and operations during the technical innovation movement, respectively increasing production efficiency by one to eighty-nine times.

　　This newspaper reports: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region held its first congress of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction in industry, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade in Yinchuan from October 12th to 18th. More than 500 representatives from all fronts reported to the Party and the people on the tremendous achievements made by the region's 130,000 workers in the Great Leap Forward, determined to fight hard in the fourth quarter, complete various plans for this year half a month ahead of schedule, fully prepare for production and construction in the first quarter of next year, and achieve continued Great Leap Forward next year.

　　The staff and workers of all ethnic groups in Ningxia, encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have seen leaps and bounds in production. According to statistics from January to September: The total industrial output value of the region has completed 85.7% of the annual plan, an increase of 161.2% over the same period last year. Compared with the same period last year, the output of major products has increased: crude coal increased by more than four times, indigenous coke increased by more than three times, power generation increased by more than two times, refractory bricks increased by more than five times, and soap increased by fifteen times. Great achievements have also been made in transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade.

　　This congress was also a mobilization meeting to further boost morale, resolutely implement the Party's general line, and complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule. The representatives exchanged advanced experiences at the meeting and discussed specific measures to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy. Many units proposed to complete the annual plan one month or forty days ahead of schedule. Representatives of the coal industry system guaranteed: To complete the production task of 2.25 million tons of raw coal for the whole year one month ahead of schedule, and strive to increase production by another 300,000 tons. The representatives of the power industry system guaranteed: To complete the annual production plan of 30.49 million kilowatt-hours of power generation prescribed by the state one month to forty days ahead of schedule, and complete the construction plan of installing 11,500 kilowatts of installed capacity one month ahead of schedule. The representatives of the commercial system guaranteed: To complete the annual procurement task of agricultural and sideline products by the end of November, and to overfulfill the annual procurement task by 10% by the end of the year.

　　Many representatives wrote letters or made phone calls to their factories during the conference, promptly conveying the spirit of the conference. Some representatives in Yinchuan even rushed back to the factory late at night to study leap forward measures. While the conference was in progress, congratulatory letters, congratulatory telegrams, proposals, resolutions, and guarantees poured in from all over the region. The workers of the whole region dedicated gifts to the conference with practical actions of continuously creating new achievements. A new mass movement to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule has taken shape on all fronts such as industry and transportation in the autonomous region.

　　The conference selected 47 representatives to attend the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade. Among the representatives is the Chen Wentong bricklaying squad, which has consistently achieved high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety for eight years. After arriving in Ningxia, the eleven projects undertaken by this bricklaying squad in nine months were all completed ahead of schedule, all of the quality reached the superior grade, and more than 59,000 bricks and more than 6,000 kilograms of cement were saved for the state, completing the task in a fast, good, economical, and efficient manner. At present, the Chen Wentong bricklaying squad has become a pacesetter in the region's construction industry. Among the representatives is also Ding Zhanrong, an old Hui boatman who has safely navigated 58,000 kilometers in the rapids of the Yellow River for ten years and created a pulley mast, increasing work efficiency by nearly a hundred times, as well as the Yinchuan Wool Textile Factory, which completed the original state plan for this year 122 days ahead of schedule, and the representatives of advanced collectives such as the Longde County Sutai Store, which helps the commune develop mountainous areas and develop diversified operations.

    人人争先进　处处出英雄
    四川河南宁夏选出出席全国“群英会”代表
    新华社成都21日电　四川省已选出四百三十二名先进集体和先进生产者代表出席全国“群英会”。
    代表中有提前三个多月完成今年全年国家计划的先进集体成都量具刃具厂，由一个普通木工变成机械工程师并且担任了重庆钢铁公司转炉炼钢厂副厂长的黄荣昌，重庆长安机器厂革新能手魏高厚，南桐煤矿水力采煤队队长黄昌华等。他们包括工人、工程技术人员、政治工作干部、行政干部和服务人员等；少数民族地区由于工业迅速发展，代表人数有了显著增加。
    大跃进以来，四川省工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸战线上的群众运动汹涌澎湃，英雄辈出。全省在今年上半年就出现了先进生产者三十四万多人，先进集体两万多个。这些先进集体和先进人物在党的培育下，普遍具有藐视困难、敢想敢干的共产主义风格。例如，黄荣昌为了实现运输机械化，去年先后设计和创造了龙门行车、磁性吊车、大型江边双臂起重机等十五部大型机器设备。当他第一次设计大型自动化运输设备时，曾有个别工程技术人员说他的设计书本上没有，缺乏理论根据。黄荣昌说：“正因为书本上没有才更要创造，创造出来以后，书本上就有了。”重庆市文具工厂王曰睿，为了试制“红岩”高级蓝黑墨水，苦心钻研，百折不挠，在三年零四个月中试验了四千一百三十四次，终于在第四千一百三十五次试验成功。
    先进帮后进，共同跃进，也是他们的特色。在生产上已经跨过1962年的成都量具刃具厂先进生产者田景琦，不仅帮助全组二十四个工人提前做完了1960年的工作量，还六次到成都电动机制造厂帮助这个厂的工人改进操作方法，使这个厂的车工车间产量提高了40％。成都市无线电厂先进生产者庞仁英，曾先后三次被工厂调到工作薄弱的小组，帮助这些小组成为先进生产小组。
    新华社郑州21日电　河南省已经选出出席全国“群英会”的先进生产者九十九名，先进集体一百一十三个，并且邀请了科学、教育、文化、卫生、社办工业等方面的特邀代表二十六名。
    河南省今年在社会主义劳动竞赛中涌现出了一万八千多个先进集体和三十一万三千多名模范人物。他们的代表中，有安阳钢铁公司水冶炼铁厂技师陈世和，他积极革新技术，创造了风管不停燃、蒸气清灰、后烟道停燃不休风清灰等先进经验，使高炉保持长寿高产；有开封机械厂钳工王本祯，他五年来创造改进工具五百九十五种，其中效率较高的二十五种，如果按生产定额和效率提高倍数计算，一年能完成七十六年的工作量；还有全国拣字能手张继英，他努力改进操作，创造了每小时拣六千六百五十八个字的惊人成绩。
    这些先进生产者不但注意提高产量，而且十分注意质量、安全和节约。像洛阳机务段四○○五机车司机长徐五江，他由于经常注意机车的维修保养，在9月中旬实现了安全行走一百万公里的指标。漯河市财贸部门先进工作者代表、模范生猪押运员孔庆金，三年半押运生猪一万五千多头，运输路程十五万四千多里，没有发生过死亡、失落等事故，损耗比定额降低2.5％，为国家节约三万七千三百多元。六十六岁的粮食保管员许全仁，是经过二万五千里长征的老英雄，他热爱革命事业，创造了八十万斤粮食保管三年不霉坏、不变色、不走味的出色成绩，现在他又提出了十年不霉坏一粒粮的保证。
    在先进集体中，有利用系数超过二、生铁合格率达到百分之百的新乡市钢铁工厂的小高炉，焦作煤矿安全生产十年的刘九学采煤队，五年来年年超额完成生产任务的郑州国棉二厂细纱丙班一组。还有连续七个月达到车吨月产万吨公里的许昌公路运输公司汽车一队，提前十六个月建成一对大型矿井的平顶山郝堂煤矿，战胜重重困难提前三个月完成全年计划的黄河勘测设计工作组等。
    这些先进人物和先进集体还有一个共同的特点，就是都发扬了先进帮助落后，相互学习，共同提高的精神。例如观音堂煤矿赵光荣先进掘进队专门抽出老技工帮助李世清小组提高技术，使李世清小组在半个月之内就赶上了自己。劳动模范刘群章在技术革新运动中帮助三十多人改进了工具和操作，分别使生产效率提高一倍到八十九倍。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区10月12日到18日在银川举行第一次工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面的社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会。来自各个战线的五百多名代表，向党和人民汇报了全区十三万职工在大跃进中取得的巨大成就，决心大战第四季度，提前半个月完成今年各项计划，充分做好明年第一季度的生产建设准备，实现明年的继续大跃进。
    宁夏各族职工在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，生产一跃再跃。根据1月至9月的统计：全区工业总产值已经完成全年计划85.7％，比去年同期增长161.2％，主要产品产量与去年同期比较：原煤增长四倍多，土焦炭增长三倍多，发电量增长二倍多，耐火砖增长五倍多，肥皂增长十五倍。交通运输、基本建设、财贸等方面也都取得了巨大的成绩。
    这次大会又是再鼓干劲、坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，提前完成全年生产计划的誓师大会。代表们在会上交流了先进经验，讨论了深入开展增产节约运动的具体措施。许多单位提出要提前一个月或四十天完成全年计划。煤炭工业系统的代表保证：要提前一个月完成全年二百二十五万吨原煤的生产任务，并力争再增产三十万吨。电业系统代表保证：提前一月到四十天，完成全年国家规定的发电量三千零四十九万度的生产计划，提前一个月完成装机一万一千五百瓩的建设计划。商业系统的代表保证：到11月底，完成全年农副产品的收购任务，到年底超额完成全年收购任务10％。
    许多代表在大会期间写信或打电话给自己的工厂，及时传达了大会的精神。银川市有的代表还深夜赶回工厂，研究跃进措施。当大会正在进行的时候，贺信贺电、倡议书、决心书、保证书纷纷从全区各地传来。全区职工用不断创造新的成绩的实际行动，向大会献礼。一个新的为提前完成全年生产计划的群众运动已在自治区的工业、交通等各条战线上形成。
    大会选出了出席全国工业、交通、运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会的四十七名代表，代表中有八年来一贯高产、优质、低耗、安全的陈文通瓦工排，这个瓦工排到宁夏以后，在九个月中所担负的十一项工程，项项都提前完成，质量全部达到优等，并为国家节约了五万九千多块砖，六千多斤水泥，多快好省地完成了任务。目前，陈文通瓦工排已成为全区建筑业中的标兵。代表中还有十年来在黄河激流中安全航行五万八千公里，并创造滑车桅，提高工效近百倍的回族老船工丁占荣，有提前一百二十二天完成今年原订国家计划的银川毛纺织厂，以及帮助公社开发山区、发展多种经营的隆德县苏台商店等先进集体的代表。
