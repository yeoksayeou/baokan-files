Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The Beijing football team, including most of the national team players, won a friendly match against the Algerian National Football Team at the Xianongtan Stadium today with a score of 4-2.

This was a very exciting friendly football match. In the first half, both sides were evenly matched, with no goals scored. The second half was fiercely contested, with six goals scored consecutively by both teams. More than 20,000 spectators frequently applauded the Beijing team's fierce attacks and the visiting team's skillful playing techniques.

In the first half, the Beijing team had a total of thirteen shots, two more than the visiting team, but the shots were either wide or too straight, and were punched out or caught squarely by the visiting team's goalkeeper Doudou, who is 1.83 meters tall and weighs 86 kilograms. The visiting team, which was good at breaking through from the middle, often shot wide or had their shots blocked by the Beijing team's defenders due to the home team's dense defense in the middle, or the ball was caught by goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu. The visiting team's center forward, Mekloufi (No. 9), was not only fast but also good at shooting. He shot seven times in the first half alone, posing a great threat to the Beijing team.

Based on the visiting team's tight containment of Beijing team's fast-running right winger Cong Zhey and right inside forward Chen Jialiang's many attacks from the right in the first half, the Beijing team changed the left winger Fang Renqiu to the left inside forward position in the second half, and Wang Lu replaced the right inside forward Sun Yuanshan to play left winger, strengthening the attack on the left. At the same time, the forwards and midfielders actively fought for the ball and used cross-switching methods, causing loopholes in the visiting team's defense, and the situation on the field immediately changed. Within less than a quarter of an hour after the kickoff, the Beijing team scored three goals in a row.

At this time, the experienced visiting team showed a unique calm spirit, which was praised by the audience. The oldest left inside forward, Alibi, had retreated from the forward line to the defense line to strengthen the defense. After intercepting the ball in the penalty area, he and other defenders did not blindly kick the ball away to clear the danger, but used their extremely skilled ball control techniques to control the ball at their feet, and then organized the attack step by step. At this time, the visiting team took advantage of the opportunity of the Beijing team's defenders often running to the midfield to assist the attack, and the defense was empty. They launched two fast-breaking attacks from the middle and succeeded. One was when the right inside forward Soukane Akarmali (No. 8) shot into the goal from ten meters in front of the Beijing team's goal in the twenty-third minute, and the other was when Soukane Akarmali shot from a distance into the net five minutes before the end of the game. These two successful shots won warm applause from the audience for a long time.

A minute later, when Wang Lu of the Beijing team shot from the left, Chaburi (No. 6), who came up to rescue, accidentally touched the ball into his own net, and the final score of four to two appeared on the field.

The Algerian National Football Team is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 23rd to prepare for a friendly match with the Hebei Provincial Football Team there on the 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: When the Czechoslovakian National Men's Basketball Team played a friendly match with the Chinese People's Liberation Army "Bayi" Men's Basketball Team tonight, they calmly and tenaciously attacked in the last three minutes, reversed the defeat and won 91-87 over the "Bayi" team, winning warm applause and praise from more than 5,000 spectators in the Beijing Gymnasium.

This friendly match was tense and exciting, with the scores of both sides remaining very close, and there were seven ties. A "shooting competition" often appeared on the field. The "Bayi" team had the advantage of leading the score for most of the time. At the end of the first half, the "Bayi" team led by four points with 49-45, and in the last three minutes of the second half, they still led by one point with 79-78.

In the second half, the visiting team once used the tactics of "double center" with Tětiva, who is 1.98 meters tall, and Tomašek, who is 1.95 meters tall, under the basket, while Bavrluk (No. 11) and Merkel (No. 12) interspersed and cut in from the left and right to score layups. The two of them played very actively and each scored 24 points in the whole game, becoming the team members with the most points for the visiting team. Among them, Bavrluk participated in the international competition for the 150th time today. In the last three minutes, the "Bayi" team was a little flustered, the number of passing errors increased, and the continuous five substitutions made it impossible for the players on the field to stabilize their emotions, and by the end of the game, the visiting team was leading by four points.

    首都两场精采国际球赛
    北京足球队四比二胜阿尔及利亚队
    捷国家男篮91比87胜“八一”队
    据新华社21日讯　包括大部分国家队员在内的北京足球队，今天在先农坛体育场同阿尔及利亚国家足球队举行的一场友谊比赛中，以四比二获得胜利。
    这是一场十分精采的足球友谊赛，上半场双方势均力敌，各无所获。下半场争夺激烈，双方连续踢进了六个球。两万多名观众不时为北京队的凌厉攻势和客队熟练的踢球技巧，报以阵阵的响亮掌声。
    上半场北京队共射门十三次，比客队多两次，但球不是射偏就是射得太正，被客队身高一米八十三、体重八十六公斤的守门员杜杜打出或抱个正着。而善于从中路突破进攻的客队，由于主队密集防守中路，多次远射球也经常射偏和被北京队后卫挡出，或被守门员张俊秀把球抱在怀中。客队中锋麦克鲁菲（九号）不仅跑得快，而且善于射门，上半场一个人就射了七次门，给北京队很大威胁。
    根据上半场客队严密封锁北京队奔跑快速的右边锋丛者余、右内锋陈家亮多次从右路进攻的情况，北京队下半场由左边锋方纫秋改踢左内锋的位置，由王陆换下了右内锋孙元山踢左边锋的位置，加强了左路的攻势，同时前锋、前卫也积极抢球和采用交叉换位的办法，使客队防线屡出漏洞，场上形势立刻发生了变化。在开球后不到一刻钟的时间内，北京队就先后攻入了三个球。
    这时，有经验的客队表现出的特有的沉着精神，受到了观众的赞扬。年纪最大的左内锋阿里比已由锋线退到后卫线加强防守，他同其他后卫在禁区内截到球后不是盲目地踢大脚解围，而是用他们极为熟练的控制球技术把球控制在脚下，然后一步步组织进攻。客队这时利用北京队后卫经常跑到中线附近助攻、后防空虚的机会，两次从中路展开快速突破的进攻获得成功。一次是第二十三分钟时由右内锋苏坎·阿卡尔马利（八号）在北京队球门前十米处射入一球，另一次是在终场前五分钟时又由苏坎·阿卡尔马利远射入网。这两次成功的射门博得了观众长时间的热烈掌声。
    过了一分钟，北京队王陆从左路射门时，客队赶上来解救的沙布里（六号）误把球碰入网内，场上出现了四比二的最后得分局面。
    阿尔及利亚国家足球队预定23日去天津，准备25日在那里同河北省足球队举行友谊赛。
    据新华社21日讯　捷克斯洛伐克国家男子篮球队今晚同中国人民解放军“八一”男子篮球队举行友谊比赛时，在最后三分钟内沉着顽强地进攻，反败为胜，以九十一比八十七赢了“八一”队，博得了北京体育馆里五千多名观众的热烈掌声和赞扬。
    这场友谊比赛打得紧张、精彩，双方比分始终很接近，并且曾经七次打成平局。场上经常出现“投篮比赛”的场面，“八一”队大部分时间占着得分领先的优势，上半场结束时“八一”队曾以四十九比四十五领先四分，下半场最后三分钟时也还以七十九比七十八领先一分。
    下半场客队一度由身高一米九十八的特蒂瓦和身高一米九十五的托马舍克在篮下打“双中锋”的战术，同时由巴夫鲁克（十一号）、麦尔克尔（十二号）左右穿插切入上篮得分。他们两人打得十分活跃，全场各得了二十四分，成为客队得分最多的队员。其中巴夫鲁克今天已经是第一百五十次参加国际比赛。到最后三分钟时，“八一”队有些慌乱，传球失误增多，加上连续五次换人，使场上队员情绪始终不能稳定下来，到终场时反被客队领先了四分。
