According to a report in the New Hunan Daily: The Liaoshi Commune Party Committee in Chen County, Hunan Province, adheres to the working method of mass-based inspections, comparisons, and competitions, which enables the vast number of cadres and members to maintain vigorous drive, wave after wave of production upsurges, and the continuous emergence of advanced units and advanced individuals.

This commune has consolidated the inspection and comparison system. Through regular inspections and comparisons, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been greatly mobilized, enabling comprehensive leaps forward in various productions and balanced development of production in various teams. Following the bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice, the commune's late rice has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with total output estimated to increase by about 30% compared to last year. The two thousand two hundred and eighty mu of oil tea produced more, was harvested earlier, and was harvested cleaner than in previous years. The progress of winter planting is also very fast, and so far 85% of the plan has been completed. In carrying out inspections and comparisons, they have gained a lot of experience, which can be summarized into four main points:

I. Adhere to regular comparisons, display red flags widely, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward strive to catch up with the advanced. The commune Party committee regards inspection and comparison as a regular task. When deploying tasks, it simultaneously proposes the conditions for inspection and comparison, and conducts regular inspections and comparisons. This year, the commune has achieved monthly inspections and comparisons; the entire commune is divided into four zones, and two fixed inspections and comparisons are carried out in the middle and end of each month; the brigades have insisted on an inspection and comparison every ten days; and the production teams have insisted on an inspection and comparison every five days. In the inspections and comparisons, red flags are widely displayed at each level, and models are established. Therefore, after each inspection and comparison, a wave of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and competing with the advanced emerges, with fierce competition between zones, teams, groups, and individuals. The Qili Brigade and the Baishu Brigade belong to the same zone and are old rivals in the competition. When rushing to harvest mid-season rice, the commune proposed completing the rush harvest in twelve days. The Qili Brigade took the lead and completed it three days ahead of schedule, while the Baishu Brigade took half a month to harvest. As a result, the Qili Brigade was awarded the red flag. Then, in rushing to plant autumn miscellaneous grains, the Baishu Brigade mobilized the masses and worked hard to catch up with the Qili Brigade, completing the sowing task in eight days, planting a total of 579 mu of autumn miscellaneous grains. Although the Qili Brigade also made great efforts, it lagged behind by two days, planting a total of 556 mu of autumn miscellaneous grains. This time, the red flag was taken by the Baishu Brigade. In this way, chasing each other, more and more advanced units and advanced individuals emerged. In the cultivation and management of late rice, the commune commended 607 red flag holders and 176 model units; but by the time of winter planting, the number of red flag holders had increased to 1,211, and the number of model units had increased to 268.

II. Put forward clear goals and set specific conditions for inspection and comparison, so that the large-scale inspection and comparison is both vigorous and down-to-earth. From October 8th, the entire commune launched a ten-day shock campaign to harvest (late rice), plant (winter crops), and manage (field management). During the shock campaign, all late rice and oil tea must be harvested, all winter crops must be planted, and field management of autumn miscellaneous grains and winter crops must be done well. According to this goal, the commune Party committee organized a high work efficiency competition movement centered on rushing to harvest and plant, and proposed three things to look at and three things to compare in the inspection and comparison: look at good labor organization and compare momentum; look at fast progress and compare work efficiency; look at high yield and compare quality. Each brigade and production team further concretized the conditions put forward by the commune Party committee according to their own situation. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses was immediately aroused, and the work proceeded smoothly. The entire commune harvested more than 6,000 mu of oil tea in only two days, completed the rush harvest of late rice in only eight days, and planted all winter crops that should be planted according to the season. As production activities are interlinked, the inspection and comparison also constantly puts forward new goals and new conditions according to the different characteristics of production activities, so that the masses' production enthusiasm continues to rise and the inspection and comparison movement continues to develop without stopping.

III. Fully mobilize the masses, turn the inspection and comparison into a mass movement, and achieve mutual inspection, mutual supervision, mutual promotion, and mutual collaboration. Before each large-scale inspection and comparison, the commune Party committee always conducts ideological mobilization from top to bottom, so that cadres and members consciously take action, thereby forming a vigorous mass movement. Therefore, each inspection and comparison can achieve great results. Recently, when carrying out winter sowing and winter planting, the progress of the Liaoshi Brigade was very fast, and the Longhu Brigade immediately sent people to visit and learn. During the visit, they learned a lot of things, and at the same time, they also found that a few people in this team disregarded quality. 40% of the rapeseed planted in the Tangchong ridge did not germinate. They wrote a big-character poster: "Your enthusiasm is really great, but the quality is poor; some rapeseed has not germinated, hurry up and replenish it to save it." The Liaoshi Brigade humbly accepted their opinions and dispatched 106 members the next day to replenish the seeds.

IV. Strengthen leadership, go deep down, discover problems, and solve them in time, so that the inspection and comparison movement can develop healthily. The commune Party committee has a total of five secretaries. The first secretary personally takes charge of the entire commune's inspection and comparison, and the other four secretaries lead the inspection and comparison of each zone separately. The Xianghua Brigade had not received a red flag from January to August and was always lagging behind. After the Party committee secretary Xie Chaohuai, who was in charge of this zone, discovered this situation, he immediately went deep into this brigade and found that there were two reasons for their backwardness: first, the cadres did not go deep enough, with more general appeals and less specific leadership; second, political and ideological work was not done enough, and the enthusiasm of the masses was not fully mobilized. Therefore, he patiently educated the brigade cadres and boosted their confidence. With his specific help, the brigade cadres overcame their shortcomings, went deep down to mobilize the masses, and quickly aroused the enthusiasm of the masses, and the pace of production rose rapidly. In the last battle of the 8th and 9th months, they were honorably rated as the red flag brigade of the whole commune.

Under the impetus of large-scale inspection and comparison, the cadres and masses of this commune are continuing to make great efforts to vigorously carry out autumn and winter production. They want to strive to overfulfill this year's production plan and create conditions for greater leaps forward next year.

    成功的工作方法保证了生产的不断高涨
    蓼市公社丰富了大评比的经验
    据新湖南报消息：湖南省郴县蓼市公社党委坚持群众性的大检查、大评比、大竞赛的工作方法，使广大干部和社员经常保持旺盛的干劲，生产高潮一浪盖一浪，先进单位和先进人物不断涌现。
    这个公社已经把检查评比作为制度巩固下来了。通过经常性的检查评比，大大调动了群众的生产积极性，使各项生产得到了全面跃进，使各队的生产得到了平衡发展。继早、中稻大丰收之后，全公社的晚稻又获得了空前大丰收，总产量估计将比去年增产30％左右。二千二百八十亩油茶，比往年产得多，收得早，而且收得干净。冬种的进度也很快，到目前为止，已完成计划85％。在开展检查评比中，他们取得了不少经验，总结起来，主要有这样四条：
    一、坚持定期评比，大插红旗，使先进的更先进，后进的奋勇赶先进。公社党委把检查评比作为一项经常性的工作抓，在布置任务时，同时提出检查评比的条件，定期进行检查评比。今年，公社作到了每月进行一次检查评比；全社分四个片，每月在月中和月尾进行两次固定的检查评比；大队坚持了每十天一检查评比；生产队坚持了每五天一检查评比。在检查评比中，逐级大插红旗，大树标兵，因此，每进行一次检查评比之后，紧接着便出现了学先进、赶先进、赛先进的热潮，片与片、队与队、组与组、人与人，开展了火热的竞赛。七里大队和白树大队属于一个片，是竞赛的老对手。在抢收中稻时，公社提出十二天完成抢收任务，七里大队一马当先，提前三天就完成了，而白树大队却收了半个月。结果七里大队评上了红旗。接着抢种秋杂，白树大队发动群众，发奋追赶七里大队，八天就完成了播种任务，共种秋杂五百七十九亩。七里大队虽然也大鼓干劲，但落后了两天，共种秋杂五百五十六亩。这次，红旗被白树大队夺走了。就这样你追我赶，先进单位和先进人物越来越多，在晚稻的培育管理中，全公社评出的红旗手有六百零七个，模范单位有一百七十六个；但到冬种时，红旗手已增加到一千二百一十一个，模范单位增加到二百六十八个。
    二、提出明确的奋斗目标，订出具体的检查评比条件，使大检查大评比既轰轰烈烈，而又扎扎实实。10月8日起，全社开展收（晚稻）、种（冬种）、管（田间管理）突击旬，在突击旬中，要把晚稻、油茶全部抢收回来，把冬种作物全部种下去，并且要搞好秋杂和冬种作物的田间管理。根据这个奋斗目标，公社党委组织了一个以抢收抢种为中心的高工效竞赛运动，提出了三看三比的检查评比条件：看劳动组织好，比声势大；看进度快，比工效高；看产量高，比质量好。各大队、生产队又根据自己的情况，把公社党委提出的条件更加具体化。这样，一下子就把群众的积极性鼓动起来了，工作进行得很顺利，全公社只有两天就把六千多亩油茶摘回来了，只有八天就完成了晚稻抢收任务，按季节应种的冬种作物也全部种下去了。随着生产活动一环套一环，检查评比也根据生产活动的不同特点，不断提出新的奋斗目标和新的条件，使群众的生产情绪不断高涨，使检查评比运动不停顿地向前发展。
    三、充分发动群众，把检查评比变成群众性的运动，作到互相检查，互相督促，互相促进，互相协作。在每次开展大检查大评比以前，公社党委总是从上到下，首先进行思想发动，使干部和社员都自觉地行动起来，从而形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动，因此每开展一次检查评比，都能收到很大的实效。最近搞冬播冬种，蓼市大队的进度很快，龙虎大队马上派人去参观和学习。在参观中，学到了很多东西，同时，也发觉这个队有少数人不顾质量，种在塘冲垅的油菜，有40％没有生芽。他们就写了一张大字报：“你们干劲真是大，但是质量搞得差；有些油菜没发芽，赶快补火挽救它。”蓼市大队虚心接受了他们的意见，第二天就出动了一百零六个社员进行补火。
    四、加强领导，深入下去，发现问题，及时解决，使检查评比运动健康地向前发展。公社党委一共有五个书记，全公社的检查评比由第一书记亲自挂帅，其他四个书记分头下片领导，掌握各个片的检查评比。香花大队从1月到8月一直没有得到过红旗，老是落在后面。掌握这个片的党委书记谢朝槐发现这个情况后，马上深入到这个大队，发现他们落后的原因有两个：一是干部深入不够，一般号召多，具体领导少；二是政治思想工作作得不够，群众的积极性没有充分调动起来，于是，他耐心地向大队干部进行教育，鼓舞他们的信心。在他的具体帮助下，大队干部克服了缺点，深入下去发动群众，很快就把群众的劲头鼓起来了，生产进度飞快上升。在大战8、9月的最后一个战役里，光荣地被评为全社的红旗大队。
    在大检查大评比的推动下，这个公社的干部和群众正在继续大鼓干劲，大闹秋冬生产，他们要争取超额完成今年的生产计划，为明年的更大跃进创造条件。
