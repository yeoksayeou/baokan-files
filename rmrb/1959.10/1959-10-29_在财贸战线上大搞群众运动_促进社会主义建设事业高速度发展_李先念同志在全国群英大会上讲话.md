Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, Finance and Trade, entitled "Launch a Mass Movement on the Financial and Trade Front to Promote the High-Speed Development of Socialist Construction."

In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian summarized the excellent situation on all fronts of production and construction in our country this year, and focused on the urgent tasks in the current financial and trade work.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of the whole country have been opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, and have further launched a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, resulting in new and tremendous upsurges on all fronts. On the basis of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the financial and trade sectors have also shown a more prosperous scene. The agricultural product purchasing campaign has already begun ahead of schedule and is currently developing vigorously; fiscal revenue has seen a huge increase; and market supply is getting better day by day.

Li Xiannian pointed out that the urgent tasks currently facing financial and trade work are to launch the broad masses, on the basis of further deepening the opposition to right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and strengthening education on the general line, to continue to carry out the agricultural product purchasing campaign and organize industrial products to go to the countryside; to continue to promote the development of non-staple food production and diversified rural economy; to continue to promote the development of industrial and handicraft production; and to continue to increase fiscal revenue and urban and rural savings, in order to strive for a comprehensive victory in financial and trade work in 1959 and to prepare good conditions for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960.

First, strive to complete the task of purchasing agricultural products. This is the center of current financial and trade work. Doing this work well is of utmost importance for promoting the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, for ensuring the needs of grain and light industrial raw materials, for further improving market supply, for meeting the people's growing needs as much as possible, and for ensuring export sources. At present, the purchasing work in the vast majority of regions has entered a high tide and has achieved great results. The current requirement is: to further boost energy, set off a greater upsurge, continue our efforts, advance victoriously, accomplish it in one go, and strive to complete and overfulfill the purchasing task quickly. In the purchasing work, it is necessary to grasp politics, grasp ideology, and vigorously publicize the general line. It is necessary to explain to the cadres and members of the people's communes that selling more agricultural products to the state can increase industrial raw materials, increase market supply, increase commune accumulation, and increase member income, achieving four benefits in one stroke. This is of great significance to the country, the collective, and the individual. The purchasing campaign should be both vigorous and solid; it should both fulfill the task satisfactorily and correctly implement policies; it should both grasp purchasing and grasp transportation and processing; it should both grasp major varieties and grasp minor varieties; it should both grasp domestic products and grasp wild products. The movement should start and end well, be implemented to the end, and leave no loose ends. After the end of the shock movement, attention should also be paid to regular purchases. In order to do a good job in purchasing work and correctly implement the Party's grain policy, it is necessary to combine the unified purchase of grain with arranging the lives of farmers, and guide the masses to implement planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption. In order to support the purchase of agricultural products and to support the continued leap forward in rural production and construction, it is necessary to do a good job in supplying the countryside with means of production and daily-use industrial products. In terms of means of production, in addition to continuing to do a good job in supplying agricultural tools needed for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, it is also necessary to actively do a good job in supplying farmland water conservancy equipment, agricultural and sideline product processing equipment, transportation tools, and various fuels. For agricultural machinery and tools, irrigation and drainage machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc. required for spring plowing, spring sowing, and spring irrigation next year, relevant parties should also cooperate to make arrangements and preparations as early as possible. The supply of daily-use industrial products should follow this principle: all that the countryside needs should be resolutely transferred to the countryside; all that both urban and rural areas need should currently give priority to meeting the needs of the countryside, so that farmers can buy more industrial products after a year of hard work. As for agricultural and sideline products, the countryside should actively support the cities. All that the cities need should be resolutely supplied to the cities as long as possible. In short, workers and farmers, industry and agriculture, should cooperate closely and support each other. At present, doing a good job in purchasing agricultural products and supplying industrial products to the countryside is of great significance for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Second, strive to promote the development of non-staple food production and diversified operations. Currently, autumn is passing and winter is coming, which is a great time to develop diversified rural operations. The superiority of the people's communes should be further brought into play, agricultural and commercial cooperation should be strengthened, and diversified operations should be greatly developed. Financial and trade departments should actively promote the development of diversified operations from the aspects of participating in production planning, supplying means of production, raising production funds, running demonstrative factories and farms, assisting in solving technical problems, concluding combined contracts, and opening up product sales channels. Special attention should be paid to the development of non-staple food production. Each city should, based on its own situation, further implement the central government's established policy of "self-reliance as the main factor, striving for external assistance as a supplement," and strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods. On the basis of increased production of non-staple foods, the vast rural areas should rationally arrange the ratio between the self-sufficient part and the commodity part, increase the commodity rate, increase the commodity volume, and actively support the cities.

Third, strive to promote the development of industrial production and handicraft production, and strengthen industrial and commercial cooperation. Financial and trade departments must do a good job in supplying raw materials, especially agricultural and sideline products, native and special products, and waste materials, and expand the use of wild plant raw materials. This is one aspect; on the other hand, financial and trade departments must also actively do a good job in purchasing industrial products and handicraft products. If industrial departments and handicraft departments complete their production plans ahead of schedule, commercial departments will purchase them ahead of schedule. If industry overproduces, commerce will overpurchase. Commercial departments should frequently reflect market needs and consumer opinions, and assist production departments in increasing varieties and improving quality, so that production is more suitable for the needs of the masses.

Fourth, on the basis of implementing policies, strive to increase fiscal revenue and increase urban and rural savings. Due to the huge growth of industrial and agricultural production and the over-planned completion of tasks, it is entirely possible for fiscal revenue to overfulfill the 1959 national budget. Finance and bank staff should actively tap potential in accordance with the policies of the Party and the state, increase accumulation from state-owned enterprises and other aspects, and guarantee the capital needs for production and construction and the capital needs for commodity circulation according to the state's plans and in accordance with the principle of thrift. In bank savings work, publicity and education should be strengthened to enable people to live a planned life, make careful calculations, and have reserves.

Li Xiannian said that we are carrying out the above tasks all around a main purpose, which is to promote the high-speed development of production and construction, and on the basis of production development, to better ensure the supply to the market. He emphasized that our financial and trade work should not only promote the national economy to develop forward at a general speed, but also promote the national economy to develop forward at a high speed and better guarantee supply. This is the fundamental task of financial and trade work. Whether it is the finance and banking departments, or the commerce, grain and foreign trade departments, they should guide the spearhead of the mass movement to promoting the high-speed development of production, and should share the same fate and breathe the same breath with industrial and agricultural production departments and the entire national economy. In financial work, we should actively mobilize the masses, increase accumulation, increase income, and rationally allocate funds, and increase investment in construction as much as possible to promote the high-speed development of production and construction; on the basis of objective possibilities, more income, more expenditure, and more construction; more income, more expenditure, and more construction. This is the correct principle of promoting the high-speed development of the national economy through fiscal revenue and expenditure. In commercial work, we should also proceed from the requirements of accelerating construction, rely on the masses, cooperate with all parties, promote production, open up sources of goods, expand purchases, rationally allocate, ensure needs, and stabilize prices; according to the requirements of the planned economy and the development of production, more purchases, more supplies, and more production; more purchases, more supplies, and more production. This is the correct way to promote the high-speed development of the national economy through commodity circulation. In promoting production development, we should first promote the high-speed development of agricultural production, promote agricultural mechanization, and promote the increase of the commodity rate of agricultural products.

Li Xiannian said that we emphasize that the fundamental task of financial and trade work is to promote the high-speed development of production and construction, but this does not mean that financial and trade departments can ignore the aspect of serving the people's lives. Serving the people's lives is also an extremely important task of financial and trade work, and cannot be ignored in the slightest. We must mobilize the staff and workers of the financial and trade departments to do everything possible to do a good job in the supply of grain, non-staple foods, and daily-use industrial products, and to do a good job in the service work of catering, bathhouses, hairdressing, tailoring, and repairs, and strive to meet the people's growing needs; do everything possible to improve service quality, improve service attitude, and serve consumers diligently. We must strive to guide and help the people to arrange their lives well, and within the possible scope, gradually improve the people's lives. People are the most fundamental and most revolutionary factor in the productive forces. Ensuring the people's living needs, making everyone strong, healthy, happy, and full of energy, is a very important condition for promoting the high-speed development of production. Production develops, then life can be improved; life is improved, then production can be better developed. This is the dialectical relationship between production and life.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphatically pointed out that in order to successfully complete the various tasks of financial and trade work, it is necessary to launch a vigorous mass movement under the leadership of the Party. Conducting vigorous mass movements with leadership is an important condition for the great achievements of financial and trade work in the past, and it is also the only correct way for financial and trade work to continue to leap forward and achieve greater achievements in the future.

Li Xiannian then talked about some issues that should be paid attention to in launching mass movements on the financial and trade front. He said that the mass movements on the financial and trade front must implement the principle of combining internal and external forces and cooperating together. It is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the staff and workers within the financial and trade system, and also to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people outside the financial and trade system. Financial and trade work is a link that combines production and consumption and combines various production departments. The nature of financial and trade work and its position determine that in order to complete the task of financial and trade work, it must rely on the joint efforts of both internal staff and external masses. In the relationship between financial and trade departments and industrial production departments, agricultural production departments, transportation departments, and other departments, it is necessary to continuously strengthen socialist cooperation between each other. In the work of purchasing agricultural products, it is necessary to always pay attention to relying on the support of rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers; in the work of purchasing industrial products, it is necessary to establish good mutual assistance relations with production departments; in the work of commodity sales and distribution, it is necessary to rely as much as possible on the assistance and supervision of the residents; in the work of commodity transportation, it is necessary to closely combine and act in coordination with railway, transportation, and other transportation departments; in the work of organizing fiscal revenue and rational use of funds, it is also necessary to obtain the support of all state-owned enterprises, people's communes, relevant units, and the broad masses, trust them, rely on them, and complete tasks through them.

The mass movement within the financial and trade departments is mainly to closely combine the leadership and the strength of the masses and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of staff and workers. In grass-roots enterprises, the system of manager responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and the system of workers' representative congress stipulated by the central government should be implemented, and the system of "two participations and one reform" (cadres participate in labor, employees participate in management, and improve business management) or the system of "three participations and one reform" (cadres participate in labor, employees participate in management, residents participate in supervision, and improve business management) should be implemented. These systems are the organizational guarantee for all grass-roots financial and trade enterprises to unswervingly implement the Party's general line and Party policies, and are the application and development of the Party's mass line working method in enterprise management, and are a good form of combining leadership and the masses. We must adhere to these systems for a long time, and continue to improve them in development. In addition, attention should also be paid to labor and rest, combining labor and rest, and advancing rhythmically in the movement.

Li Xiannian pointed out that the mass movement on the financial and trade front must strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement politics in command. This is the fundamental guarantee for the healthy development and victory of the movement. Our strengthening of the Party's leadership and the implementation of politics in command is to defeat bourgeois ideology with proletarian ideology and guide the masses to forge ahead in the direction pointed out by the Party's general line.

He said that we emphasize that the leadership of the Party must be strengthened in the mass movement and that politics must be put in command, but this does not mean that economic work, economic accounting, business issues, and technical issues can be ignored. Political work and economic work are unified. Leaving economic work, leaving specific business work, the mass movement will lose its content and become an empty thing, and political tasks will not be realized; however, business must obey politics. Seeing only business and not seeing politics will not be possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it is not possible to discern the direction, it is impossible to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and it will embark on the wrong path.

Li Xiannian said that since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, many advanced units and advanced figures have emerged in the financial and trade front in terms of implementing policies, completing tasks, improving business management, improving service quality, carrying out technical revolution, and improving leadership style. Many red flags have been erected and red flag competition movements have been launched. The comrades sitting here today are outstanding representatives of the many advanced figures in the country. Your rich experience is the result of implementing Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line in financial and trade work together with the broad masses under the leadership of the Party. Your rich experience has an extremely important role in promoting the advancement of mass movements on the financial and trade front in the future and in improving and raising financial and trade work.

Li Xiannian finally said that our purpose in cultivating advanced individuals and establishing banners is to expand advanced individuals, drive backward individuals, and promote the continuous development of work. All advanced units and advanced individuals should regard helping and driving other units and other comrades to advance together as their own glorious political task. We hope that all advanced collectives, advanced producers, and advanced workers will always maintain the fine style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and rashness, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, constantly transform their thinking, improve their awareness, master their business, improve their technology, improve their culture, and always be advanced fighters who are both red and expert.

    在财贸战线上大搞群众运动
    促进社会主义建设事业高速度发展
    李先念同志在全国群英大会上讲话
    新华社28日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念，28日在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上作了题为“在财贸战线上大搞群众运动，促进社会主义建设事业高速度发展”的讲话。
    李先念副总理在讲话中综述了今年我国各个生产建设战线上的大好形势，并着重指出了当前财贸工作方面的迫切任务。
    李先念副总理说，党的八届八中全会以来，全国人民反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，在各个战线上都出现了新的巨大的高潮。在工农业生产继续跃进的基础上，财政贸易方面也出现了更加繁荣兴旺的景象。农产品收购运动已经提前展开，目前正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展；财政收入有了巨大的增长；市场供应情况一天比一天好。
    李先念指出，当前摆在财贸工作方面的迫切任务，是在进一步深入反右倾、鼓干劲、加强总路线教育的基础上，发动广大群众，继续开展农产品收购运动和组织工业品下乡；继续促进副食品生产和农村多种经营的发展；继续促进工业生产和手工业生产的发展；继续增加财政收入和增加城乡储蓄，以争取1959年财贸工作的全面胜利，并且为1960年国民经济的继续跃进准备良好的条件。
    首先，努力完成农产品收购任务。这是当前财贸工作的中心，做好这个工作，对于促进工农业生产的继续跃进，对于保证粮食和轻工业原料的需要，对于进一步改善市场供应、尽量满足人民日益增长的需要和保证出口货源，都具有极为重要的意义。现在，全国绝大多数地区收购工作已经进入高潮，获得了很大的成绩。当前的要求是：进一步鼓足干劲，掀起更大的高潮，再接再厉，乘胜前进，一气呵成，力争迅速完成和超额完成收购任务。在收购工作中，要抓政治，抓思想，大张旗鼓地宣传总路线。要向人民公社的干部和社员说明，把更多的农产品卖给国家可以增加工业原料，增加市场货源，增加公社积累，增加社员收入，一举四得。这对于国家、集体和个人都有极大的意义。收购运动既要轰轰烈烈，又要扎扎实实；既要完满地完成任务，又要正确地执行政策；既要抓收购，又要抓调运和加工；既要抓主要品种，又要抓次要品种；既要抓家生的，又要抓野生的。运动要善始善终，贯彻到底，不留尾巴。在突击运动结束以后，还要注意经常收购。为了做好收购工作，正确贯彻党的粮食政策，必须把粮食统购同安排农民生活结合起来，指导群众实行计划用粮、节约用粮。为了支持农产品收购，为了支援农村生产建设继续跃进，必须做好生产资料和日用工业品下乡的工作。在生产资料方面，目前除了继续做好秋收秋耕秋种所需农具的供应工作以外，还应当积极做好农田水利器材、农副产品加工器材、运输工具和各种燃料的供应工作。对于明年春耕春播春灌所需要的农械农具、排灌机械、化学肥料、农药等，也要协同有关方面及早进行安排和准备。日用工业品的供应，应当遵循这样的原则：凡是农村需要的，应当坚决调给农村；凡是城乡都需要的，目前优先满足农村的需要，使农民在一年辛勤劳动以后，能够买到更多的工业品。至于农副产品，乡村应当积极支援城市，凡是城市需要的，只要可能，应当坚决供应城市。总之，工人和农民，工业和农业，应当亲密合作，互相支援。目前做好农产品收购工作和工业品下乡工作，对于进一步巩固工农联盟是有重要意义的。
    第二、努力促进副食品生产和多种经营的发展。目前秋去冬来，正是发展农村多种经营的大好时机。应当进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，加强农商协作，让多种经营来一个大的发展。财贸部门应当从参与生产规划、供应生产资料、筹集生产资金、举办示范性的工厂和农场、协助解决技术问题、订立结合合同、开拓产品销路等方面，积极促进多种经营的发展。对于副食品生产的发展，应当特别加以重视。各个城市应当根据自己的情况，进一步贯彻执行中央规定的“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，努力实现主要副食品的基本自给或者部分自给。广大农村应当在副食品增产的基础上，合理地安排自给部分和商品部分的比例关系，提高商品率，增加商品量，积极支援城市。
    第三、努力促进工业生产和手工业生产的发展，加强工商协作。财贸部门必须做好原料材料的供应工作，特别是农副产品、土特产品和废旧物资的供应工作，推广野生植物原料的使用范围，这是一方面；另一方面，财贸部门还必须积极做好工业产品和手工业产品的收购工作。工业部门和手工业部门提前完成生产计划，商业部门就提前收购，工业超产，商业超购。商业部门要经常地反映市场需要和消费者的意见，协助生产部门增加品种，改进质量，使生产更加适合群众的需要。
    第四、在执行政策的基础上，努力增加财政收入，增加城乡储蓄。由于工农业生产的巨大增长和超计划完成任务，财政收入超额完成1959年国家预算是完全可能的。财政、银行工作人员应当按照党和国家的政策，积极挖掘潜力，从国营企业和其他方面增加积累，并且根据国家的计划，按照节约的原则，保证生产建设的资金需要，保证商品流通的资金需要。在银行储蓄工作中，应该加强宣传教育，使人们有计划地过好日子，精打细算，留有后备。
    李先念说，我们进行上面这几项工作，都是围绕一个主要目的，就是促进生产建设的高速度发展，在生产发展的基础上，更好地保证对市场的供应。他强调说，我们的财贸工作不仅要促进国民经济按照一般速度向前发展，而且更要促进国民经济高速度地向前发展和更好地保障供应，这是财贸工作的根本任务。不论是财政、银行部门，也不论是商业、粮食和对外贸易部门，都应当把群众运动的矛头，引导到促进生产的高速度发展方面来，都应当同工农业生产部门，同整个国民经济同命运，共呼吸。在财政工作中应当积极发动群众，增加积累，增加收入，并且合理地分配资金，尽可能地增加建设投资，促进生产建设的高速度发展；在客观可能的基础上，多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设，这是通过财政收支促进国民经济高速度发展的正确原则。在商业工作中也应当从加速建设的要求出发，依靠群众，协作各方，促进生产，开辟货源，扩大收购，合理分配，保证需要，稳定物价；按照计划经济的要求和生产发展的情况，多收购，多供应，多生产；更多地收购，更多地供应，更多地生产，这是通过商品流通促进国民经济高速度发展的正确途径。在促进生产发展中，目前应当首先促进农业生产的高速度发展，促进农业机械化，促进农产品商品率的提高。
    李先念说，我们强调财贸工作的根本任务是促进生产建设的高速度发展，并不是说财贸部门可以忽视为人民生活服务的方面。为人民生活服务也是财贸工作的一个极为重要的任务，丝毫不能忽视。我们必须发动财贸部门的职工群众，千方百计地做好粮食、副食品和日用工业品的供应工作，做好饮食、澡堂、理发、缝纫、修理等方面的服务工作，努力满足人民日益增长的需要；千方百计地提高服务质量，改进服务态度，勤勤恳恳地为消费者服务。必须努力指导和帮助人民很好地安排生活，并且在可能的范围内，使人民生活逐步有所提高。人，是生产力中最根本的、最革命的因素，保证人民的生活需要，使人人身强体壮、心情舒畅、精神饱满、干劲十足，是促进生产高速度发展的一个十分重要的条件。生产发展了，才能改善生活；生活改善了，才能更好地发展生产，这就是生产与生活的辩证关系。
    李先念副总理着重指出，要胜利地完成财贸工作的各项任务，必须在党的领导下，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动。有领导地开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，是过去财贸工作取得巨大成就的重要条件，也是今后财贸工作继续向前跃进、取得更大成就的唯一正确道路。
    李先念接着谈到财贸战线上开展群众运动应该注意的一些问题，他说，财贸战线上的群众运动必须实行内外结合、共同协作的原则，既要充分发挥财贸系统内部职工群众的积极性，又要充分发挥财贸系统以外广大社会群众的积极性。财贸工作是结合生产和消费、结合各个生产部门间的纽带。财贸工作的性质和它所处的地位，决定了财贸工作要完成任务，必须依靠内部职工和外部群众两方面的共同努力。在财贸部门同工业生产部门、农业生产部门、交通运输部门以及其他部门的关系上，必须不断地加强相互间的社会主义协作。在农产品收购工作中，必须经常注意依靠农村干部和广大农民群众的支持；在工业品收购工作中，必须同生产部门建立良好的互助关系；在商品销售和分配工作中，必须尽可能地依靠居民群众的协助和监督；在商品调运工作中，必须同铁道、交通等运输部门密切结合协同动作；在组织财政收入和合理使用资金的工作中，也必须取得所有国营企业、人民公社、有关单位和广大群众的支持，信任他们，依靠他们，并且经过他们去完成任务。
    财贸部门内部的群众运动，主要是把领导和群众的力量密切结合起来，充分调动广大职工群众的积极性。在基层企业中，应当实行中央规定的党委领导下的经理负责制和职工代表大会制，实行“两参一改”的制度（干部参加劳动，职工参加管理，改善经营管理）或者“三参一改”的制度（干部参加劳动，职工参加管理，居民参加监督，改善经营管理）。这些制度，是一切基层财贸企业坚定不移地贯彻执行党的总路线、党的政策的组织保证，是党的群众路线的工作方法在企业管理工作中的运用和发展，是领导和群众相结合的一种良好形式。我们必须把这些制度长期地坚持下去，并且在发展中不断使它更加完善。此外，在运动中也要注意有劳有逸，劳逸结合，有节奏地前进。
    李先念指出，财贸战线上的群众运动，必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，这是运动健康发展取得胜利的根本保证。我们加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，就是要以无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想，引导群众按照党的总路线所指引的方向奋勇前进。
    他说，我们强调在群众运动中必须加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，并不是说可以忽视经济工作，忽视经济核算，忽视业务问题和技术问题。政治工作和经济工作是统一的，离开经济工作，离开具体的业务工作，群众运动就失去内容，变成空洞的东西，政治任务也就无从实现；但是业务必须服从政治，只见业务不见政治，就不可能发动广大群众的积极性，就不可能辨清方向，就无法抵抗资产阶级思想的侵蚀，就会走上错误的道路。
    李先念说，1958年大跃进和1959年继续跃进以来，财贸战线上在执行政策、完成任务方面，在改善经营管理、提高服务质量、开展技术革命和改进领导作风等各方面，都出现了许多先进单位和先进人物，树立了许多红旗，开展了红旗竞赛运动。今天在座的各位同志，就是全国许许多多先进人物中的优秀代表。你们的丰富经验，是在党的领导下，同广大群众一起，在财贸工作中执行了毛主席思想和党的总路线的结果。你们的丰富经验，对于推动今后财贸战线上群众运动的前进，对于改进和提高财贸工作，具有极其重大的作用。
    李先念最后说，我们培养先进、树立旗帜的目的，就是为了扩大先进，带动落后，推动工作不断向前发展。一切先进单位和先进人物，应当把帮助和带动其他单位和其他同志共同前进，当作自己的一项光荣的政治任务。我们希望，一切先进集体、先进生产者和先进工作者，永远保持谦虚谨慎、戒骄戒躁的优良作风，努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，不断地改造思想，提高觉悟，精通业务，提高技术，提高文化，永远作又红又专的先进战士。
