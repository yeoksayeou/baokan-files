　　These days, cotton purchasing is going very well. The national cotton purchasing progress has rapidly increased from several hundred thousand dan per day to nearly one million dan. At this moment, we received the good news that Handan Prefecture has completed its purchasing plan ahead of schedule. Hebei Province is a major cotton-producing province in the country, and Handan Prefecture is a major cotton-producing area in Hebei Province. The good news from Handan Prefecture reflects the situation of rapid progress on the cotton purchasing front.
　　The victory of Handan Prefecture in purchasing cotton once again illustrates the necessity of putting politics in command and launching a mass movement in purchasing work. Handan Prefecture implemented the Party's call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, launched a large-scale mass movement, and closely combined the strength of commercial workers and the broad masses of farmers, so that the purchasing work could make such rapid progress. The situation in Handan Prefecture proves that the broad masses of farmers are full of enthusiasm and joyfully delivering agricultural products to the state. As long as Party committees at all levels strengthen leadership, and as long as all business departments strengthen their work, on the basis of continuously improving the awareness of the broad masses of farmers, the movement to purchase agricultural products will certainly develop rapidly and more extensively.
　　This year's cotton production is higher than last year, the purchasing progress is faster than last year, and the quantity purchased is greater than last year. It seems that the total amount purchased this year will greatly exceed last year. However, we cannot be satisfied with the existing progress and achievements. Although Handan Prefecture has already completed this year's cotton purchasing plan, the Handan Prefectural Committee, in view of the fact that cotton is still continuing to bloom and fluff, and production is still continuing to increase, called on cotton farmers to continue to actively deliver cotton and strive to further over fulfill the state purchasing plan. This approach is entirely correct. All cotton-producing areas in the country should learn from the example of Handan Prefecture, advance victoriously, achieve complete victory in one go, and strive for a complete victory in this year's cotton purchasing work.

　　一气呵成争取全胜
    这些天的棉花收购情况好得很。全国棉花收购进度从每天几十万担飞速上升到近百万担。正在这个时候，我们收到了邯郸专区提前完成收购计划的捷报。河北省是全国一个主要产棉省，邯郸专区又是河北省一个主要产棉区。邯郸专区的捷报，反映了棉花收购战线日进千里的形势。
    邯郸专区收购棉花的胜利，又一次说明了收购工作中政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的必要性。邯郸专区贯彻了党的反右倾、鼓干劲的号召，大搞群众运动，把商业工作人员和广大农民群众的力量密切地结合起来，收购工作才得到这样迅速的进展。邯郸专区的情况证明：广大农民群众对于向国家交售农产品，是满怀热情、欢欣鼓舞的。只要各级党委加强领导，只要各个业务部门加强工作，在不断提高广大农民群众觉悟的基础上，农产品的收购运动，就一定可以迅速地更加广泛地向前发展。
    今年棉花的产量比去年多，收购的进度比去年快，收购的数量比去年多。看来，今年收购的总数将会大大超过去年。但是，我们不能满足于已有的进度和成绩。邯郸专区虽然已经完成了今年棉花的收购计划，但是邯郸地委鉴于棉花还在继续开花吐絮，产量还在继续增加，号召棉农继续踊跃交售棉花，争取进一步超额完成国家收购计划，这样的作法是完全正确的。全国一切产棉区，都应当学习邯郸专区的榜样，乘胜前进，一气呵成，争取今年棉花收购工作的全胜。
