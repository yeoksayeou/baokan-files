Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th: Guizhou Province has launched its largest mass "Small Autumn Harvest" movement in history. Currently, 3.4 million "treasure-gathering" troops are working hard in the mountains, bringing down a wealth of goods. The Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, as of October 15th, had collected a total of 60 million jin of tung seeds, tea seeds, Qinggang seeds, gallnuts, rosin, medicinal herbs, and wild fibers, with a total value of over 12 million yuan. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the Bijie, Zunyi, and Anshun special districts, are collecting tens of thousands of jin of mountain products every day.

This year, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou have overcome a relatively severe drought and achieved a bumper harvest of grain. In order to achieve an all-round leap forward in agriculture, the province has decided to launch the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement.

In the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, all localities have earnestly implemented the policy of simultaneously promoting collective and individual management, adapting to local conditions. For large-scale, concentrated, or technically/seasonally demanding varieties, the communes and production teams uniformly allocate labor, collectively manage, or organize specialized teams to harvest them in a concentrated manner. For small-scale or scattered varieties, members are mobilized to collect them during production breaks. After the Heishi Commune of the Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County adopted the above two methods, the income from only cork oak and medicinal herbs reached 15,000 yuan, an average of 30 yuan per laborer.

In order to cooperate with this movement, the commercial departments have transferred more than 60,000 employees to the countryside and mountains. Carrying samples, they help the masses identify varieties and explore resources during the day; they hold small material exchange meetings at night to promptly purchase mountain products. Since entering October, the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has held more than 500 various material exchange meetings, purchasing more than 40 million jin of tea seeds, gallnuts, Qinggang seeds, medicinal herbs, and various mountain products, accounting for 60% of the mountain products already collected, promoting the continuous development of the movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 24th: Anhui Province has made great achievements in collecting, purchasing, and utilizing wild plants. As of the beginning of October, the province had collected more than 2 million dan of wild fibers, oilseeds, starches, tannin extracts, medicinal materials, pesticides, and other raw materials, more than 60 million dan of feed, and 63,000 jin of wild peppercorns.

The wild plants collected by the people's communes in various places, except for pesticide raw materials and various feeds retained for their own use, have all been sold to the state. Since the beginning of this year, relevant departments in various places have used the purchased wild tannin extract raw materials to produce more than 300 tons of tannin extract, used wild oilseeds to produce more than 1 million jin of aromatic oil and more than 1,600 dan of fatty oil, used wild starch to brew more than 450,000 jin of wine, and used various wild plants to manufacture more than 100 kinds of indigenous pesticides.

The collection and utilization of wild plants has not only enriched industrial raw materials, but also increased the income of communes and members. In less than a year, people's communes and members throughout the province have earned more than 10 million yuan from the sale of wild plant raw materials and semi-finished products.

Anhui Province has always attached great importance to the collection, purchase, and utilization of wild plant raw materials. Starting in April this year, 58 counties conducted a general survey of wild plant resources; specialized organizations have been established from the province to the people's communes to lead this work. Recently, in order to seize the favorable opportunity of autumn, continue to mobilize and deeply carry out the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement to collect wild plants in a concentrated manner, and do a good job in the regular collection, purchase, and utilization of wild plants in the future, Anhui Province held a special meeting for discussion and deployment. After the meeting, a "Small Autumn Harvest" movement to collect wild plants has rapidly unfolded. Anqing Special District has more than 1 million people participating in this movement. Taiping County in Wuhu Special District collected 130,000 jin of acorns in three days. Chuxian County in Bengbu Special District has collected more than 80,000 dan of medicinal materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th: In the work of collecting and purchasing wild oilseed plants, Hebei Province has adopted the method of launching a mass movement. All localities have launched a vigorous publicity campaign to explain to the broad masses the significance of collecting wild oilseeds for national construction and their own income. All people's communes have mobilized a large number of laborers to collect them during production breaks. According to incomplete statistics from Longguan, Renqiu, Qinglong, and Zunhua counties alone, 200,000 people have participated in the work of collecting wild oilseeds and other wild plants. Currently, more than 1 million jin of wild oilseeds have been collected.

In order to facilitate the sale of goods by the masses, the commercial departments have adopted many measures. In addition to purchasing stations (stores), they have also adopted purchasing methods such as pushing carts to the countryside, going from village to village, and widely utilizing rural purchasing and sales agents.

Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 24th: The Greater Khingan Mountains area of Inner Mongolia has overfulfilled its annual seed collection plan. As of mid-October, it has collected more than 34,000 kilograms of pure seeds of larch, Korean pine, birch, black birch, oak, hazelnut and other trees.

When the tree seeds were just about to mature, the Party committees at all levels in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area arranged seed collection work. Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of commune members, family members of workers and staff, workers and students launched a high tide of seed collection. The workers of logging, collecting and transporting materials also carried out the movement of not going back empty-handed. The logging workers collect tree seeds while felling trees, and the collecting and transporting workers also pick tree seeds when they see them while working in the mountains. The workers and students carried out voluntary labor for seed collection. In the Daqilaha Forest Farm of the Ituli River Forestry Bureau, there is a women's seed collection team of more than 30 people. They go to places 20 to 30 miles away every day to collect seeds. After more than 20 days of hard work, they collected more than 1,000 kilograms of pure seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: The young people of Liaoning Province actively participate in the "Small Autumn Harvest" activities, seizing mountain treasures and wild goods from barren mountains and wild lands.

According to preliminary statistics from Andong, Luda, Yingkou and other cities, and Xifeng, Jinxi, Jin County, Suizhong, Tai'an and other counties, more than 2.6 million jin of wild oilseeds, starch plants and medicinal materials have been collected. From October 11th to 14th, Andong City mobilized more than 178,800 young people and collected 395,400 jin of wild oilseed plants. More than 38,000 young people in Xifeng County collected more than 1,266,600 jin of wild plants in a few days. The young people in Huanren County also carried out a competition for 10,000-jin communes and 1,000-jin teams. The 10,000 young people in Longtan Commune formed 420 collection commando teams, launched a competition with each other, and collected more than 25,000 jin of oil crops in four days.

In order to make the "Small Autumn Harvest" activities of young people in the province more in-depth, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently called on the young people in the rural areas of the province to universally carry out a "thousand-dou ten-thousand-basket, thousand-jin ten-thousand-dan" blitz competition to collect wild plants. It also proposed that young people, in addition to actively participating in collective collection by the commune, can also make full use of their spare time for collection.

    百万群众上山  大量财宝下山
    贵州安徽河北内蒙古辽宁
    小秋收运动迅速开展
    据新华社贵阳24日电　贵州省掀起了历年来规模最大的一次群众性“小秋收”运动，目前有三百四十万“采宝”大军正在山区大干特干，百宝滚滚下山。黔东南苗族侗族自治州截至10月15日统计，已采摘桐子、茶子、青杠子、五棓子、松香、药材和野生纤维等共六千万斤，总值达一千二百多万元。黔南布依族苗族自治州和毕节、遵义、安顺等专区，每天采集的山货都达数十万斤。
    今年，贵州山区各族人民在党的领导下，战胜了比较严重的旱灾，粮食获得大丰收。为了实现农业全面跃进，全省决定开展“小秋收”运动。
    在“小秋收”运动中，各地都因地制宜地认真贯彻执行集体经营和个人经营同时并举的方针。凡属大宗的、集中的或技术性季节性较强的品种，都由公社、生产队统一调配劳力，集体经营，或组织专业队，突击采摘。小宗或分散的，便发动社员利用生产间隙进行。威宁彝族回族苗族自治县黑石公社采用上述两种办法结合进行以后，仅栓皮栎、药材两项，收入即达一万五千元，平均每个劳力收入三十元。
    为了配合这一运动，商业部门抽调了六万多名职工下乡上山。他们带着样品，白天帮助群众辨品种，摸资源；夜间召开小型物资交流会，及时收购山货。黔东南苗族侗族自治州进入10月以来，召开了各种物资交流会五百多次，收购了茶子、五棓子、青杠子、药材及各种山货四千多万斤，占已采摘的山货60％，促使运动不断向前发展。
    据新华社合肥24日电　安徽省采集、收购、利用野生植物的成绩很大。到10月上旬止，全省各地已采集野生纤维、油料、淀粉、栲胶、药材、农药等原料二百多万担，饲料六千多万担，野生花椒六万三千斤。
    各地人民公社采集的野生植物，除农药原料和各种饲料留作自用外，其余的都已卖给国家。今年以来，各地有关部门已经利用收购的野生栲胶原料生产栲胶三百多吨，利用野生油料生产芳香油一百多万斤、脂肪油一千六百多担，利用野生淀粉酿酒四十五万多斤，利用各种野生植物制造土农药一百多种。
    野生植物的采集和利用，不仅丰富了工业原料，而且增加了公社和社员的收入。不到一年的时间，全省人民公社和社员，已从出售野生植物原料和初制品中收入了一千多万元。
    安徽省对采集、收购和利用野生植物原料一直很重视。从今年4月开始，有五十八个县普查了野生植物资源；从省到人民公社都成立专门机构来领导这个工作。最近，为了抓紧秋季有利时机，继续发动深入开展突击采集野生植物的“小秋收”运动和做好今后经常性的采集、收购、利用野生植物的工作，安徽省又召开专门会议作了讨论和部署。会后，一个采集野生植物的“小秋收”运动已迅速展开。安庆专区已有一百多万人投入了这一运动。芜湖专区太平县三天就采集橡子十三万斤。蚌埠专区滁县已采集药材八万多担。
    据新华社天津24日电　河北省各地在采集和收购野生油料植物的工作中，采取了大搞群众运动的办法。各地展开了声势浩大的宣传工作，向广大群众说明采集野生油料对国家建设和自己收入的意义。各人民公社都发动大批劳动力，利用生产空隙进行采集。仅据龙关、任丘、青龙、遵化等县的不完全统计，就有二十万人参加了采集野生油料和其它野生植物的工作。目前已采集野生油料一百多万斤。
    为了便利群众出售，商业部门采取了许多措施，除了采购站（店）收购以外，还采取推车下乡、串村串户、广泛利用农村代购代销员等收购办法。
    新华社牙克石24日电　内蒙古大兴安岭地区已超额完成全年采种计划，到10月中旬止，已采摘落叶松、樟子松、白桦、黑桦、柞、榛子等树纯种三万四千多公斤。
    大兴安岭林区各级党委在树种刚要成熟的时候，就布置了采种工作。各地广大社员、职工家属、职工和学生，在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，掀起了采种高潮。采伐、集材、运材的工人也开展了不空手运动。采伐工人边伐树边采树种，集材和运材工人在山上工作时见到树种也顺便采摘。职工们和学生们进行了采种义务劳动。在伊图里河林业局大其拉哈林场有一支妇女采种队，三十多人，她们每天到二、三十里路外去采种。经过二十多天的奋战，共采了纯种一千多公斤。
    新华社沈阳24日电　辽宁省青少年积极参加“小秋收”活动，向荒山野地夺取山珍野宝。
    据安东、旅大、营口等市和西丰、锦西、锦县、绥中、台安等县的初步统计，目前已采集野生油料、淀粉植物和药材等达二百六十多万斤。安东市从10月11日到14日出动了十七万八千多名青少年，采集野生油料植物三十九万五千四百多斤。西丰县三万八千多名青少年，几天内就采集野生植物一百二十六万六千多斤。桓仁县青少年还开展了万斤社、千斤队的评比竞赛。龙潭公社的一万名青少年，组成了四百二十个采集突击队，相互展开竞赛，在四天时间内就采集了二万五千多斤油料作物。
    为了使全省青少年的“小秋收”活动更加深入展开，共青团辽宁省委员会最近号召全省农村青少年普遍开展一个“千斗万筐、千斤万担”的采集野生植物的突击竞赛。并提出，青少年除积极参加公社集体采集外，还可以充分利用零星时间进行采集。
