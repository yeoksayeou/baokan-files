(Our newspaper from Wuhan, 28th) Hubei Province's Xinzhou County, which has suffered several severe natural disasters this year, has seen its total harvest of early rice, mid-season rice, and single-season late rice increase by more than 20% compared to last year. The yield per unit area has increased to varying degrees compared to the same season last year. The second-season late rice, which is currently being harvested, is expected to exceed last year's level in both total output and yield per unit area.

The bumper rice harvest in Xinzhou County this year is the result of the broad masses of cadres and people, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, holding high the banner of the Party's General Line, persistently struggling against right-leaning conservative thinking, and continuously leveraging the tremendous superiority of the people's communes. During the spring planting season, after the county Party committee put forward the task of expanding the replanting area and further reforming cultivation techniques, those with right-leaning conservative ideas raised various difficulties to oppose it. However, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of cadres and people roused soaring enthusiasm, overfulfilled the original plan to expand the replanting area, and technological reforms were also carried out much better than last year.

This year, Xinzhou County suffered natural disasters that were rare in history. Between spring and summer, mountain floods broke out three times, and a large number of seedlings were damaged to varying degrees. From the end of June, it suffered a severe drought lasting more than 100 days. At that time, the vast majority of cadres and the masses resolutely advocated carrying out a comprehensive drought resistance struggle to ensure a bumper rice harvest; however, some people with serious right-leaning conservative thinking advocated protecting a part and abandoning a part, and some even advocated abandoning agriculture to engage in sideline occupations. Party committees at all levels united the vast majority of cadres and the masses around themselves, seriously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and at the same time led the masses to bravely fight against the disaster. During this period, under the continuous exertion of the power of the people's communes, they moved rivers, lakes, and reservoirs with earth-shattering momentum, irrigating more than 200,000 mu of drought-stricken rice fields. In this way, people finally achieved a great victory in subduing the 100-day drought and secured a bumper rice harvest season after season.

    战胜百日大旱　反透右倾保守
    新洲县水稻季季丰收
    本报武汉28日电　今年接连几次遭到严重自然灾害袭击的湖北省新洲县，早稻、中稻和一季晚稻的总收获量比去年增长两成以上，单位面积产量分别比去年同季有不同程度的提高。正收割中的二季晚稻预计总产量和单位面积产量都可以超过去年同季的水平。
    新洲县今年水稻大丰收，是广大干部和群众在各级党委的领导下，高举党的总路线的旗帜，坚持不懈地向右倾保守思想斗争，并不断发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性的结果。春播时期，县委提出了扩大复种面积和进一步改革耕作技术的任务后，有右倾保守思想的人就曾提出这样那样的困难来反对。可是，广大干部和群众在各级党委的领导下鼓起了冲天的干劲，超额完成了原订扩大复种面积的计划，技术改革也搞得远比去年好。
    今年新洲县遭受自然灾害是历史上罕见的。春夏之间曾三次暴发山洪，大量秧苗受到不同程度的损害。从6月底起，又遭受了持续达一百多天的大旱灾。当时绝大多数干部和群众坚决主张全面开展抗旱斗争，确保水稻丰收；但一部分右倾保守思想严重的人，却主张保一部分、丢一部分，有的甚至主张丢掉农业去搞副业。各级党委把绝大多数干部和群众团结在自己的周围，严肃地批判右倾保守思想，同时领导群众奋勇地向灾害作斗争。这期间，他们在不断发挥人民公社威力的条件下，以移山倒海的气势大搬江、河、湖水，灌溉了二十多万亩受旱的稻田。就这样，人们终于取得了降伏百日大旱的伟大胜利，保住了水稻的季季丰收。
