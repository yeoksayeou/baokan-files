　　To let the friendship and unity between Asian and African countries achieve new victories, and let the imperialists' conspiracies be defeated once again.

　　Leader U Chit Tun warmly congratulated the China-Myanmar friendship for surging like a tidal wave.

Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: U Chit Tun, the leader of the Burmese Cultural Friendship Delegation, and all members of the delegation held a farewell banquet in Beijing tonight. The delegation will leave Beijing for home on the 18th.

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi attended the banquet and spoke at the banquet. He said that the Burmese government sent government representatives and a cultural friendship delegation to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is a manifestation of friendship. He expressed his gratitude to the Burmese government on behalf of the Chinese government.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that during their stay in China, Leader U Chit Tun and the distinguished guests of the Cultural Friendship Delegation visited various construction projects in our country and gave high evaluations of the achievements made by the Chinese people, the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for labor, and the organization and discipline shown by the Chinese people in construction. This represents the feelings of the broad masses of the Burmese people. He said that China's achievements were achieved by overcoming difficulties, and in the future we will overcome new difficulties, continue to move forward, and achieve greater achievements. He once again expressed his gratitude for the praise given by Burmese friends.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that it will take a long time for a large country like China with a large population to completely solve its own problems. We need a peaceful environment, and we need a continued easing of the international situation, to concentrate on domestic construction. Therefore, we need to live in peace with all our neighbors, and we need to live in peace with all countries in the world, especially with Southeast Asian countries that share common borders. Disputes between countries can be resolved completely through peaceful methods, and they must be resolved through peaceful methods.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that these disputes are legacies of history, all left over by Western colonialists and imperialists. If they are not resolved through peaceful methods, it will precisely play into the hands of the imperialists. We must let the imperialists' conspiracies be defeated once again, and let the friendship and unity between Asian and African countries achieve new victories.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Myanmar is our closest neighbor, a relative country. Historically, no major disputes have occurred between us. We can completely adopt the principles of the Bandung Conference to solve problems between our two countries and consolidate and develop the friendship between our two countries. Continuing to develop and maintain the friendship between our two countries can have a very good impact and promote friendly relations between Asian and African countries. He said that this visit to China by the Burmese Cultural Friendship Delegation has contributed to the friendship between the two countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally raised his glass and wished for the consolidation and development of the friendship between the two countries, the happiness of the Burmese people, and the prosperity of Myanmar.

U Chit Tun, the leader of the Burmese government delegation and the Burmese Cultural Friendship Delegation, spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that we sincerely thank the government of the People's Republic of China for its meticulous hospitality and care. At the same time, we are pleased that we also took the opportunity in Beijing to hold discussions with the responsible persons of the relevant departments of the People's Republic of China on the cultural and artistic situation of China and Myanmar. In addition to participating in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we also had close talks and contacts with the national leaders of China. We believe that this will enable the friendship between our two countries to achieve greater development and consolidation. The people of Myanmar greatly need the friendship between China and Myanmar, and they often congratulate the friendship between the two countries for surging like a tidal wave. When we return to Myanmar, we will definitely convey the kind and sincere wishes of the leaders of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people to the people of Myanmar.

Leader U Chit Tun said that during our visits to Beijing and Xi'an, we visited many exhibition halls, universities, and cultural and historical sites reflecting Chinese culture, which increased our knowledge. Through these visits, we have seen the brilliant progress made by the People's Republic of China in all aspects from 1949 to 1959. We are greatly excited and encouraged by this. I believe that if the Chinese people continue to work hard, diligently and thriftily, strictly observe discipline, and go all out, as we have seen, the achievements from 1959 to 1969 will be several times greater than those from 1949 to 1959. Moreover, the people of Myanmar often congratulate you on achieving these achievements.

Leader U Chit Tun said that during our visits to Beijing and Xi'an, we were able to visit many relevant departments and hold discussions with the leaders of these departments, which made us discover that we can learn many things and many methods from the People's Republic of China, which makes us feel unspeakable joy. We believe that the application of these methods by Myanmar will also promote its rapid development in all aspects.

Leader U Chit Tun said that tomorrow morning, we will bid farewell to Beijing with a heavy heart. We believe that such a farewell is like returning to our own motherland of Myanmar after visiting relatives we have not seen for many years and living happily with the host.

Leader U Chit Tun finally warmly congratulated the China-Myanmar friendship for its growth and consolidation like a tidal wave.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Deputy Directors Ding Xilin and Qu Wu, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Deputy Minister Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Liu Ruilong, Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puchu, and nearly a hundred people from Chinese cultural circles.

The Burmese Ambassador to China, Kyaw Winn, and embassy officials also attended the banquet.

The banquet was held in a friendly atmosphere for two hours. (Attached picture)

　　陈毅副总理在缅甸文化友好代表团告别宴会上说：
　　我国需要同所有国家和平共处
　　要让亚非国家之间的友谊和团结获得新的胜利，让帝国主义者的奸计再一次遭到失败
　　吴漆东团长热情祝贺中缅友谊如海潮般地高涨起来
    新华社17日讯　缅甸文化友好代表团团长吴漆东和全体团员今晚在北京举行告别宴会。代表团将在18日离开北京回国。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长出席了宴会并且在宴会上讲话。他说，缅甸政府派政府代表和文化友好代表团来参加中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝典礼，这是友谊的表现。他代表中国政府向缅甸政府表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理说，吴漆东团长和文化友好代表团的贵宾们在中国逗留期间，参观了我国的各项建设，对中国人民所取得的成就，对中国人民的劳动热情，以及中国人民在建设中表现出来的组织性和纪律性，给了很高的评价，这代表了缅甸广大人民的心情。他说，中国的成就是在克服困难中取得的，今后我们还会克服新的困难，继续前进，获得更大的成就。他对缅甸朋友给予的赞誉再一次表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理说，像中国这样一个人口众多的大国要完全解决自己的问题，需要很长的时间。我们需要一个和平的环境，需要一个继续和缓的国际局势，来安心地进行国内建设。因此，我们需要同所有邻邦和平共处，需要同世界上所有国家和平共处，在有共同边界的东南亚国家更需要和平共处。国与国之间的争端，完全可以寻求和平的方法进行解决，也一定可以用和平方法解决。
    陈毅副总理强调指出，这些争端是历史的遗留，都是西方殖民主义者和帝国主义者遗留下来的，如果不用和平方法来解决，就正好中了帝国主义者的奸计。我们要让帝国主义者的奸计再一次遭到失败，让亚非国家之间的友谊和团结获得新的胜利。
    陈毅副总理说，缅甸是我们最近的邻邦，是亲戚国家，在历史上我们之间没有发生重大的争执，我们完全可以采取万隆会议的原则来解决两国之间的问题，来巩固和发展我们两国之间的友谊。继续发展和保持我们两国之间的友谊，可以产生很好的影响，推动亚非各国的友好关系。他说，缅甸文化友好代表团这次访问中国，对两国的友谊作出了贡献。
    陈毅副总理最后举杯，祝两国友谊的巩固和发展，祝缅甸人民幸福和缅甸国运隆昌。
    缅甸政府代表、缅甸文化友好代表团团长吴漆东在宴会开始的时候讲话。他说，我们衷心感谢中华人民共和国政府所给予我们的无微不至的招待和照顾。同时，使我们感到高兴的是，我们还借着在北京的机会和中华人民共和国政府有关部门的负责人座谈了中缅两国的文化艺术情况等问题。我们除了参加中华人民共和国的建国十周年大典外，还和中国的国家领导人进行了亲密的交谈和接触。我们认为，这将使我们两国的友谊获得更大的发展和巩固。缅甸全国人民非常需要中缅两国的友谊，他们经常在祝贺两国的友谊如海潮般地高涨起来。当我们回到缅甸以后，一定把中华人民共和国领导人和中国人民对缅甸人民的亲切和善的强烈愿望转达给缅甸人民。
    吴漆东团长说，当我们在访问北京和西安期间，我们参观了许多展览馆、大学，以及反映中国文化的名胜古迹，因而使我们增加了许多见识。通过这些参观和访问，使我们看到了中华人民共和国在1949年到1959年期间各个方面都获得了辉煌的进步。对此，我们感到莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。我相信，中国人民在如我们所看到的勤俭节约、严守纪律、鼓足干劲地继续努力下去，将使1959年到1969年所取得的成就比1949年到1959年取得的成就增加数倍。而且，缅甸人民也经常在祝贺你们取得这些成就。
    吴漆东团长说，在我们访问北京和西安的时候，我们能有机会参观了许多有关部门并和这些部门的领导人进行了座谈，从而使我们发现到我们可以从中华人民共和国这里学到许多东西、许多方法，因而使我们感到有说不尽的愉快。我们认为缅甸通过这些方法的应用，也会促使它在各个方面获得迅速的发展。
    吴漆东团长说，明天早晨，我们将怀着难过的心情和北京告别。我们认为这样的告别，犹如是来到久别多年的亲戚家作客并和主人愉快共居后而重返自己缅甸祖国的告别一般。
    吴漆东团长最后热情祝贺中缅友谊如海潮般的增长和巩固。
    出席今晚宴会的，还有对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若，副主任丁西林、屈武，文化部部长沈雁冰、副部长夏衍，外交部副部长章汉夫，农业部副部长刘瑞龙，北京市副市长乐松生，中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初和中国文化界人士等近百人。
    缅甸驻中国大使叫温和大使馆官员也出席了宴会。
