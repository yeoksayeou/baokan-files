Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st: Henan Province has reaped a bumper harvest on 12.65 million mu of cotton fields. Currently, the average yield of ginned cotton is 32 jin per mu. In Xinxiang Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area, the average yield of ginned cotton has reached 40 jin per mu, and it is expected to reach 81 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. In Qingfeng, Fugou, Xinye, Zhenping, Nanyang, Xinxiang, Xiping, Shangcai, and twelve other counties (cities), 2.4 million mu of cotton are expected to yield over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Qingfeng County, where the cotton planting area has expanded year after year since liberation and the yield has increased year by year, has 210,000 mu of cotton growing particularly well, with an estimated yield of over 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. According to measurements based on what has already been harvested and the existing cotton bolls, the province's cotton production is expected to increase by more than 20% compared to last year's Great Leap Forward.

People's communes in various regions waged a tenacious struggle against severe natural disasters in cotton production. This year, insect infestations occurred in many areas, affecting more than 80% of the cotton fields. However, the people's communes seized favorable opportunities, broke down the boundaries between communes and teams, and organized five insect extermination campaigns in a concentrated and contiguous manner, eliminating the pests. A total of over 11 million mu were treated, with key cotton-producing areas generally treated more than five times, using approximately 100 million jin of various pesticides. Just as the cotton was in full bloom and bolling, when it was also severely threatened by cotton bollworms, the province experienced a severe drought. At this time, the people's communes comprehensively planned production, rationally allocated labor, and simultaneously focused on pest control and drought resistance and irrigation. Over 8 million mu of severely drought-stricken cotton fields across the province were irrigated two or three times, ensuring the normal growth of the cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st: Zhejiang Province's 1.8 million mu of cotton fields are laden with bolls, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. According to statistics up to October 8th, the eighteen key cotton-producing counties and cities have already harvested over 2.12 million dan of seed cotton, with an average yield of over 134 jin per mu, and the quality of cotton has also generally improved compared to last year.

This year, not only has the old cotton area on both sides of the Qiantang River achieved a bumper harvest, but the vast new cotton areas have also seen a bumper harvest. In Changhe Commune of Xiaoshan County, an old cotton area, the 13,000+ mu of cotton have already yielded an average of over 320 jin of seed cotton per mu, surpassing last year's total yield. In the new cotton areas of Jinhua, Yongkang, Linhai, and other counties, tens of thousands of mu of cotton fields have also exceeded the 100-jin mark for average seed cotton yield per mu, with some high-yielding cotton fields reaching over 500 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In order to ensure a high yield and bumper harvest of cotton, various cotton-producing areas have widely launched "Red, Diligent, and Skillful" high-efficiency labor competitions in cotton picking. In Cixi County, this movement is in full swing. In Xiaolin Commune, over 10,000 people are participating in the high-efficiency cotton picking competition, and over 1,100 high-efficiency experts who can pick 100 jin of cotton per day have emerged. The Cixi County Party Committee has promptly summarized and promoted the advanced experience of high-efficiency cotton picking: "Bend over and stand straight, observe in all directions, pick with both hands, step on empty spaces, and lick the cotton bract."

While picking cotton, commune members in the vast cotton-producing areas across the province sell the clean, dried, high-quality cotton to the state. In Yongkang County, nearly 3,000 people have been carrying cotton to sell to the state every day for the past half month. In September alone, they sold over 23,700 dan of seed cotton, exceeding the original plan by 58%. Cixi County organized over 5,000 commune members and dispatched over 1,500 agricultural boats to launch a concentrated campaign to sell cotton to the state. Commercial departments have universally increased the number of purchasing stations to facilitate the sale of cotton by commune members.

    河南一千多万亩棉花丰收
    浙江新老棉区棉花产量质量超去年
    据新华社郑州21日电　河南省一千二百六十五万亩棉花大丰收，目前每亩平均已收摘皮棉三十二斤。主要产棉区新乡专区，每亩平均已收摘皮棉四十斤，预计可达八十一斤，比上年增产三成多。清丰、扶沟、新野、镇平、南阳、新乡、西平、上蔡等十二个县（市）的二百四十万亩棉花，预计亩产皮棉可达百斤以上。解放后植棉面积年年扩大，产量逐年跃增的清丰县，二十一万亩棉花长得特别好，预计亩产皮棉可达一百五十多斤。根据已经收摘的和现有棉桃的测算，全省棉花产量预计将比大跃进的去年增产两成多。
    各地人民公社在棉花生产中同严重的自然害灾展开了顽强的斗争。今年，很多地区发生虫害面积占棉田面积80％以上。但是各地人民公社抓住有利时机，打破社、队界限，集中连片地组织了五次灭虫战役，消灭了虫害。先后防治面积达一千一百多万亩，重点棉区一般防治五遍以上，共用各种农药一亿斤左右。正当棉花开花结铃盛期，也是棉花受到棉铃虫严重威胁的时候，全省又发生了严重旱象。这时，各人民公社全面规划了生产，合理调配劳动力，一手抓防治虫害，一手抓抗旱浇水。全省有八百多万亩受旱严重的棉田都浇了两三遍水，保证了棉花的正常生长。
    新华社杭州21日电　浙江省一百八十万亩棉花结铃累累，一片大丰收景象。根据到10月8日止的统计，十八个重点产棉县市共已采摘籽棉二百一十二万多担，平均亩产已有一百三十四斤多，棉花质量也普遍比去年提高。
    今年不仅钱塘江两岸老棉区的棉花获得大丰收，在广大的新棉区也是丰收。老棉区萧山县长河公社的一万三千多亩棉花，现在平均每亩已收籽棉三百二十多斤，超过去年全年的产量。金华、永康、临海等县新棉区，十几万亩棉田平均亩产籽棉也已过了百斤关，有些高产棉田亩产籽棉已达到五百多斤。
    各棉区为了保证棉花丰产丰收，在收摘棉花中广泛展开了“红、勤、巧”高工效竞赛运动。慈溪县这个运动已搞得热火朝天，逍林公社参加棉花采摘高工效竞赛的有一万多人，已经出现日摘百斤棉的高工效能手一千一百多名。中共慈溪县委已及时地总结推广了“弯腰立直，眼观四方，双手齐摘，脚踏空档，舌舔花衣”的摘棉高工效先进经验。
    全省广大棉区社员一边采摘，一边就把拣净晒干的好棉花卖给国家。永康县近半个月来，每天都有三千多人挑棉花向国家投售，单是9月份就售出籽棉二万三千七百多担，超过原计划58％。慈溪县组织五千多个社员，出动一千五百多只农船，突击投售棉花。商业部门普遍增设收购点，便于社员投售。
