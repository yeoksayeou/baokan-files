    The Red Star That Never Falls
    Lei Jia
    The photographer in Yan'an, standing on the riverbank under Qingliang Mountain, is willing to serve every tourist in order to leave behind a commemorative photo.
    In the upper right of this commemorative photo is the pagoda on Jialing Mountain, and across the middle is the Yan River Bridge like a long rainbow. The pagoda, it symbolizes the beacon of revolution, standing tall and unmoving in the hearts of the people, towering in a sea of clouds. Speaking of this arch bridge, it is a newly built project in the hearts of the people of Yan'an. If you examine it further, in the lower left corner of the photo, you will see a small bridge built by the Hu Zongnan bandit gang. This bridge is really small, so small that it looks like a brick falling from the big bridge, very insignificant. This is just a reminder: How can the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive withstand the counterattack of the People's Liberation Army? It has long been swiftly and thoroughly crushed.
    This is the best angle. Anyone who comes to Yan'an first climbs the pagoda to overlook the entire city; second, steps onto the bridge to see the flowing water of the Yan River. Now, this photo captures both the pagoda and the bridge: the pagoda imprints the impression of the entire city, and the flowing water of the Yan River flows endlessly with beautiful memories.
    Strictly speaking, people who come to Yan'an do not climb the pagoda first, but rather see the pagoda first. Patriotic youths who rushed to Yan'an from the Great Rear during the War of Resistance Against Japan, or anti-Japanese soldiers who returned from the front line, traveled day and night, eager to throw themselves into their mother's embrace, and the first thing they saw was this pagoda. Don't you think there is a red star on it? It is a red star embedded in the heart that never falls. No matter where you go in the future, this red star will look at you like your mother's bright eyes.
    The bombing by Japanese planes in 1938, or the burning and killing by Hu Zongnan's bandit army in 1947, did not damage the youth of Yan'an. Because everyone who has been to Yan'an has dedicated all their youth to it, and these youthful memories decorate this ancient city like flowers that never fade.
    Do you want to find the first cave dwelling you lived in? When you open your study notes, do you remember the first open-air classroom? Do you want to recall the small path by the river where you discussed your ideals, or the meeting place where you read the oath of joining the Party? Also, you should never forget the evening party where songs fluttered, or the mountain top where you reclaimed wasteland with a hoe, right? … These countless memories can always be confirmed. Therefore, Yan'an will always be the same.
    The Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall, with a total area of about one-tenth of the entire city, has an exhibition hall that seems to have no end. I know you haven't seen it before when you were in Yan'an, but what does it matter? I dare say you are not unfamiliar with it. If you didn't come with Chairman Mao on the Long March, then you were a participant in the Weihua Uprising. Heroes who crossed the dangerous Lazikou and fighters in the Laoshan battle should have heard Chairman Mao's rectification report. The person who made the elm cannon may have become a labor model in the Great Production Movement. Or else you are a printing factory worker, a civil affairs cadre, a cultural teacher, or a medical worker… The museum records every storm and every footprint in revolutionary history.
    The Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall is a history of the Party, a school for revolutionary tradition education, and a treasure house of revolutionary weapons.
    Everyone who has lived and worked in Yan'an will ask affectionately: How are Yangjialing, Wangjiaping, and Zaoyuan now?
    The surroundings of the Yangjialing Auditorium are decorated like a garden by the afforestation youth from five provinces. A retaining slope ditch is being built, it will wash away Hu Zongnan's footprints and welcome guests of peace with applause.
    When you arrive at Zaoyuan, you will meet the old village head, Yang Chengfu. Although he could not prevent the destruction by the bandit army; he restored the original peace and order here based on his memory, as if Chairman Mao still lived here. There could be no one more cordial than him in telling the stories of Chairman Mao's life. It was the greatest joy for their entire village to have a meal with Chairman Mao during the New Year's festival. The words Chairman Mao advised them to weed and fight drought that year seem like they were just spoken yesterday. I think the reason why it is so cordial is because every memory is hidden deep in his simple feelings!
    The two stone cave dwellings in Wangjiaping were chased by Hu bandits' planes; but they were not injured. This is the last place Chairman Mao lived in Yan'an. Passing Wangjiaping is the newly built Cemetery of the April 8th Martyrs. It is in front of the former Women's University, and across the Yan River, you can see this solemn and majestic stone building. Rest in peace! Respected revolutionary martyrs! The Yan River is singing hymns of heroes for you day and night.
    A tree, an air-raid shelter here is part of the Revolutionary Museum. We meet former members of the Children's Corps, the Self-Defense Army, who are all on-the-spot narrators of this museum.
    Nanguan is still as prosperous as it used to be. Here, the dusty road of the past has been paved and widened. The road surface is often watered, and two rows of willows pour down their greenery. A police officer (please pay attention to this street woman, you may recognize her) stands in the center of the street holding a red flag, directing traffic.
    These two rows of street trees were just willow branches stuck in the ground, now they are lush and shady, and they are enthusiastically waving to you. In the city, however, are newly planted Chinese parasol trees, and the streets are wider and quieter than Nanguan. Try walking around the city! It's like going back to those days: students from Kangda (Anti-Japanese Military and Political University), students from Lu Yi (Lu Xun Academy of Arts), and cadres from government offices, they walked shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, singing to their hearts' content on the street every Sunday. They had endless songs to sing, just as they had inexhaustible enthusiasm and joy.
    Now, what I see on the street are younger students from Yanda (Yan'an University), students from Yanzhong (Yan'an Middle School), and some surveying team members wearing white cloth hats. They are the new residents and guests here. They have more happiness and fantasies, the difference is that they sing the song of builders with enthusiastic voices.
    Buses pass through the city, banks, and post office buildings stand on both sides; but at the entrance of the cinema, there are still delicious watermelons and red and big tomatoes that remind people of the past. Here, the goods are novel and the varieties are diverse, no less than those of big cities; but look at those old shops, they are still the same as before: the door panels are opened like city gates, and customers can walk in and out at will according to the habits of farmers.
    Under the Yan River Bridge, a gray donkey stands silently by the river, like you used to see, it is waiting for scoop after scoop of Yan River water to fill its buckets.
    Next to the blower, you can hear the creaking sound of the bellows. From time to time, you can see a woman in a floral cloth dress sitting on a stone bed, shaking a spinning wheel with her hands. This spinning wheel is so familiar, it seems like you used to use it. At this time, you can't help but think: Yan'an! This is the hometown of the spinning wheel.
    A new stone bridge has been built outside the North Gate, and workers are applying cement to the railings of the stone bridge. I also saw the river embankment project of the Yan River, which mostly uses the stones from the city wall. Perhaps you and I are equally surprised that this ancient city was not built of bricks, but of stones. Now, these stones have been put to practical use, making the road around the city along the Yan River wide, flat, and quiet. This is when the sun is setting in the west, the red willows are swaying gently on the city wall, and the green grass stretches forward like a green carpet, a young couple walks hand in hand, their affection is continuous. In the past, I don't know how many young men and women walked on this road on the eve of going to the front line! The breeze swept across the city wall, and the river flowed by their feet. The beautiful dusk was filled with a cup of love; but the only oath they dedicated to love was for the revolution.
    Today, the brand-new appearance of Yan'an is even more moving. 500,000 fish fry have settled down in Yan'an. A 200-mu orchard surrounds the organs, which will make this beautiful city even more fragrant. A state-owned farm was established in Dufu Chuan. The tractor station donated by the People's Liberation Army was established in Qiao'ergou in 1956.
    There is a car road under Qingliang Mountain, but I would say it is better to walk. On the way, the sweet spring water of Dingfu Spring can quench your thirst, and the famous Wanfo Cave can be visited. In addition, the Yanhui Canal, known as the source of a happy life, flows under your feet on this stone mountain.
    The Yanhui Canal runs from Diqing Prison to Ganguyi, with a total length of one hundred li, and can irrigate 30,000 mu of land. Secretary Liu of the Yan'an County Party Committee said: "Without the Great Leap Forward last year, there would be no eight self-sufficiency (self-sufficiency in cement, white lime, gunpowder, wood, etc.); without eight self-sufficiency, there would be no Yanhui Canal. Finally, we must thank the People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps for their enthusiastic support to the old area."
    The Yan'an Special District had a bumper year in 1956, and the leaping 1958 increased production by 31% compared to the bumper year. Commissioner Yang announced a continued leap forward plan, he said: "Within three years, we will make the river land in the entire special district water conservancy-ized." The unparalleled superiority of communization has brought them confidence and victory.
    The water conservancy-ization of all river lands in three years, or in other words, the total river drop difference completed in the Great Leap Forward last year, is waiting for the order of 120 generators. How can these facts not be a huge leap forward!
    In the near future, Yan'an will use its rich life and beautiful construction to welcome guests from home and abroad. Beiguan will be an industrial area. All the way to Zaoyuan, which has become a park with beautiful scenery, it is also a cultural area with countless schools. The People's Square is built at the southern end of the Yan River Bridge, and a wide street leads directly to Phoenix Mountain. Leveling the shell craters on Phoenix Mountain, it will all be greened.
    This will not be long either. Your trip will start at the passenger station in Qilipu, and this railway will pass through the tunnel of Jialing Mountain and continue north to the desert area; another branch line will also pass through the tunnel of Qingliang Mountain and go west to Ningxia. This section hub station will be built on the original airport.
    At that time, seven highway bridges and three railway bridges will tightly connect this beautiful city from both sides of the Yan River.
    However, for those of us who have been to Yan'an before, the mountain top where the fireworks celebrating the victory of the Anti-Japanese War were lit on August 15, 1945 is still there, and our footprints from here to various liberated areas are still there. On the road of advancement, we will forever sing the victory song of building socialism.

    永不降落的红星
    雷加
    延安的摄影师，站在清凉山下的河滩上，为了留下一张纪念照片，他愿为每个游客服务。
    在这张纪念照片的右上方，是嘉陵山的那座宝塔，横在中间的，是长虹一般的延河大桥。宝塔，它象征着革命的灯塔，在人民心中巍然不动，屹立在云海之中。说起这座圆拱大桥，却又是延安人心坎上的新建工程。如果再审视一下，照片的左下角，你会看见的，那里有胡宗南匪帮修的一个小桥。这桥实在小，小得像大桥上掉下来的一块砖头，很是微不足道的。这不过提醒一下：反动派的进攻，怎能禁得起解放大军的反击，它早已被迅速彻底地粉碎了。
    这是一个最好的角度。凡是来到延安的人，第一先登宝塔，俯瞰全城；第二踏上大桥，看那延河的流水。现在呢，这张照片正好留下了宝塔和大桥：宝塔上刻着全城的印象，延河流水又流不尽美好的回忆。
    严格讲起来，来到延安的人不是先登宝塔，倒是先望见了这座宝塔，抗战时期由大后方奔赴延安的爱国青年，或是由前线归来的抗日将士，他们昼夜跋涉，带着急于投入母亲怀抱的心情，第一眼望见的就是这座宝塔。你不以为上面有颗红星吗？那是一颗嵌入心中的永不降落的红星。这颗红星，不管你今后走到哪里，它都会像母亲明亮的眼睛那样望着你。
    1938年日本飞机的轰炸，或是1947年胡宗南匪军的烧杀，这都无损于延安的青春。因为每个到过延安的人，都把全部的青春奉献给它了，而这青春的回忆就像永不败落的鲜花一样地装饰着这座古城。
    你要寻找住过的第一个窑洞吗？翻开学习笔记时，你又想起了第一个露天课堂吗？你要追忆的是叙谈理想的河边小径，还是宣读入党誓词的那个会场？还有，你永远不该忘记那个歌声飘扬的晚会，或是你用镢头开荒的那个山头吧？……这无数的回忆，总能得到印证。因此，延安永远会是原来的样子。
    延安革命博物馆，总面积约占全城十分之一，它有一个似乎走不到头的展览厅。我知道你从前在延安的时候，不曾见过它，这有什么关系？我敢说你对它并不陌生。你，如果不是随同毛主席长征来的，便是渭华暴动的参加者。抢渡天险腊子口的英雄和劳山战役的战斗员，都应该听过毛主席的整风报告。那个制造榆木炮的人，也许在大生产中又成了劳动模范。再不然你就是一个印刷厂工人，一个民运干部，一个文化教员，或者是一个医务工作者……博物馆记载着革命历史中的每个风暴，每个脚印。
    延安革命博物馆是一部党史，一个革命传统教育的学校，又是一座革命武器的宝库。
    每个在延安生活过、工作过的人，都会深情地问：杨家岭、王家坪和枣园，如今怎样了？
    杨家岭大礼堂的周围，被五省造林青年装饰得像花园一样。一条护坡水沟正在砌修，它要冲掉胡宗南的脚印，鼓掌欢迎和平的客人。
    到了枣园，你会遇见当年的老乡长杨成富。他虽然不能阻止匪军的破坏；但他依据自己的记忆，在这里恢复了原来的安宁秩序，就像毛主席仍然住在这里似的。讲述毛主席的生活故事，不会有比他再亲切的了。年节时和毛主席一起聚餐，这是他们全村最大的喜事。那一年毛主席劝他们锄草抗旱的话，仿佛是昨天刚刚谈过似的。我想所以如此亲切，这是因为每一个回忆，都藏在他的朴实的感情深处呀！
    王家坪的两孔石窑，曾被胡匪的飞机追逐过；可并未受伤，这是毛主席在延安最后住过的地方。过了王家坪，就是新建的四八烈士陵园。它在从前女大的门前，隔着延河就可望见这座庄严肃穆的巨石建筑。安息吧！敬爱的革命先烈们！延河，在昼夜不息地为你们唱着英雄的赞歌。
    这里的一棵树，一个防空洞，都是革命博物馆的一部分。我们在这里遇见从前的儿童团员，自卫军，又都是这个博物馆身临其境的讲解员。
    南关，依然像过去那样繁华。这里，过去尘土飞扬的道路铺平了，展宽了。路面上经常洒水，两排柳树又把它的绿荫倾注下来。一个民警（请注意这位街道妇女，你也许会认识她的）手持红旗，站在街心指挥着。
    这两行街树，从前只是插在地上的一根根柳枝，现在茂密成荫了，并且热情地向你招手。城里却是新植的中国梧桐，街路比南关更宽，更幽静。试着在城里走一下吧！如同又回到了过去那些日子：抗大的学生、鲁艺的学生和机关干部，他们在每个星期天，肩并肩手挽手，在街上尽情地歌唱着。他们有着唱不完的歌，就像他们有着永不枯竭的热情和欢乐一样。
    现在，我在街上所看到的是更年轻的延大的学生、延中的学生和一些戴白布帽的勘察队员们。他们已是这里新的居民和客人了。他们有更多的幸福和幻想，不同的就是他们用热情的歌喉，唱着建设者之歌了。
    公共汽车穿城而过，银行、邮局大楼，矗立两边；但是在电影院门口，仍然摆着可口的西瓜和使人怀念的又红又大的西红柿。这里，商品新颖，种类繁多，比起大城市毫不逊色；可是你看看那些古老的铺面，还是从前那个老样子：门板像城门一样打开，顾客们依从农民的习惯，可以随心所欲地走进走出。
    在延河大桥下面，一匹灰色毛驴默默地站在河边上，像你过去看见的，它在等待着一杓一杓的延水装满它的水桶。
    在鼓风机旁，可以听到风箱的吚呀声。还不时看见一个穿花布衣的妇女，坐在石床上用她的手摇着纺车。这架纺车多么面熟，好像是你从前用过的。这时，你禁不住想：延安嘛！这才是纺车的故乡。
    北门外新建了一座石桥，工人们正在把水泥涂在石桥的栏杆上。我也看见了延河的砌岸工程，它大半利用了城墙上的石块。也许你和我同样感到惊奇，原来这座古城不是用砖，而是用石块砌成的。现在，这些石块派了合乎实际的用场，使延河边上这条围城马路，既宽坦，又幽静。这是夕阳西下的时候，红柳在城头上轻轻摇曳，青草如同一床绿毯向前伸展，一对青年男女手挽着手，情谊连绵地走了过去。从前，不知有多少青年男女在分赴前线的前夕，也在这条道路上漫步过呀！清风扫过城墙，河水又流过他们的脚边。美好的黄昏盛满了爱情的杯子；可是他们献给爱情的唯一誓词，却是为了革命。
    今天，延安的崭新面貌是更加动人了。五十万尾鱼苗在延安定居下来。二百亩果园围住机关，它将使这个美丽的城市，更加芳香。一个国营农场，建立在杜甫川。由解放军捐献的拖拉机站，1956年就在桥儿沟成立了。
    清凉山下有一条汽车路，依我说还是步行的好。一路上定肤泉甘美的泉水可以解渴，著名的万佛洞可以游览。此外，称为幸福生活泉源的延惠渠，就在这个石砭上从你的脚下流过。
    延惠渠由狄青牢到甘谷驿，全长一百华里，可以灌溉三万亩土地。延安县委刘书记说：“没有去年大跃进，就没有八自给（水泥、白灰、火药、木材等自给）；没有八自给，就没有延惠渠。最后，还得感谢解放军工兵团对老区的热情支援。”
    延安专区1956年是个丰收年，跃进的1958年又比丰收年增产31％。杨专员宣布了继续跃进计划，他说：“三年之内，我们要使全专区的川地水利化。”公社化的无比优越性，给他们带来了信心和胜利。
    全部川地三年水利化，或者说，去年大跃进中全部河流修成的跌差，等待着一百二十部发电机的订货。这些事实，怎能不是巨大的跃进步伐！
    不久的将来，延安要用自己丰富的生活和美丽的建设，来欢迎国内外客人了。北关将是一个工业区。一直到枣园变成了风景幽美的公园，它又是有无数学校的文化区。人民广场修在延河大桥的南端，一条宽阔的街路直通凤凰山。铲平凤凰山上那些弹坑，它要全部绿化起来。
    这也是不会很久的事。你的旅行将在七里铺走出旅客车站，而这条铁路穿过嘉陵山的隧洞，一直向北开到沙漠地带；另一条支线也要穿过清凉山的隧洞，向西开到宁夏境内。这个区段枢纽站就建设在原来的飞机场上。
    那时，七个公路桥和三个铁路桥，把这个美丽的城市从延河两岸紧紧地连系起来了。
    不过，对于我们从前到过延安的人，1945年8月15日燃起庆祝抗日胜利焰火的山头还在，我们从这里向各个解放区出发的脚印还在，在前进的大路上，我们要永远永远唱着建设社会主义胜利之歌。
