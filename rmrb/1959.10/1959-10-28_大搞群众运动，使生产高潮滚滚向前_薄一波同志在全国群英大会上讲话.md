Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech today at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the Fields of Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade, titled "Vigorously Launch Mass Movements to Drive the Production Upsurge Forward!" He analyzed the current situation and tasks on the industrial and transportation fronts and elaborated in detail on how to continuously develop the new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy through continuing to vigorously launch mass movements.

He said: The current situation in industrial production and transportation is excellent. The leaping progress continues to unfold, and the new upsurge of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy is developing vigorously, wave upon wave. Our task is to implement the Party's General Line more deeply and comprehensively, to ensure that the victorious situation already unfolded and the new production upsurge already launched continue to develop, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan ahead of schedule. At the same time, we must prepare for next year's production, striving to maintain and exceed the level of the fourth quarter of this year for industrial production (calculated by average daily output) and transportation (calculated by average daily car loadings) in the first quarter of next year. Furthermore, we must properly arrange the production of industrial products needed by agriculture this winter and next spring, vigorously support agriculture in accelerating technological transformation, so as to lay a good foundation for the joint leap forward of industry and agriculture next year.

All staff and workers on our industrial and transportation fronts must take accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture as their glorious task. Agriculture is the foundation for developing industry and the entire national economy. The development of industry and the development of agriculture must adapt to each other. Industrial support for agriculture is not only for the needs of agricultural development, but also for the needs of the socialist industrialization cause itself. The development of agriculture will not only provide industry with more raw materials, grain, and construction funds, and provide more labor, but also open up a broader market for the development of industry, which will inevitably promote the greater and more rapid development of industry.

Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of staff and workers on the industrial and transportation fronts have responded with great political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm to the Party's great call to "oppose rightism, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy," launching mass movements and vigorously unfolding a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy throughout the country. This quickly reversed the situation in June and July this year, when production declined slightly due to the stirring up trouble by right-leaning opportunists, and promoted the comprehensive rise in production in the recent three months, month by month. By the end of September this year, the total national industrial output value had reached 111.4 billion yuan, and the output value for the first nine months was already close to the total industrial output value for the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The annual industrial production plan for this year has already been completed by 76%. The total output of major industrial products such as steel, pig iron, raw coal, electricity generation, metal-cutting machine tools, crude oil, power generation equipment, power machinery, tractors, and combine harvesters from January to September has already exceeded the total output for the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The output of other major products has also increased significantly. As of October 20, railway freight volume had reached 416 million tons, accounting for 80% of the annual plan of 520 million tons, an increase of 45% over the same period last year. It can now be affirmed that the industrial production and transportation plans for this year will be completed and overfulfilled significantly ahead of schedule.

Bo Yibo pointed out that this new upsurge and new situation in production on the industrial and transportation fronts, which are rising vigorously and majestically, have unfolded on the basis of summarizing the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward and vigorous mass movements, and have many new characteristics: First, industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation are making a joint leap forward; Second, industrial production is increasing by the ten-day period. Breaking the "routine" that production at the beginning of the month always declines compared to the end of the previous month; Third, a comprehensive leap forward of more, faster, better, and more economical. Generally, high output, high quality, low consumption, high efficiency, low cost, and production safety requirements have been met; Fourth, while the production of large-scale modern enterprises is developing rapidly, the "small indigenous groups" enterprises that developed in large numbers last year have now mostly become "small foreign groups," and some have become "medium foreign groups," which have exerted great power; Fifth, the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy is closely integrated with improving enterprise management, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and the technical revolution. The organization and leadership of production work are more practical and meticulous than in the past, achieving tightness without chaos, full of energy and orderly; Sixth, combining this upsurge with the next greater upsurge, combining current production with the preparatory work for the next step in production.

Bo Yibo then pointed out: The task now facing all staff and workers on the industrial and transportation fronts is: to ensure the continued leap forward this year and to make all necessary preparations for next year's "good start" and "complete success"; to achieve a comprehensive upsurge in industrial production and to actively produce various technical equipment for accelerating the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, and to achieve a joint leap forward of agriculture and industry. The task is very glorious and also quite arduous.

Can this glorious and arduous task be accomplished? It is entirely possible. The most fundamental and most important is that the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical results is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the broad masses of staff and workers have further recognized the complete correctness and great power of the General Line, and deeply feel that the General Line is the lifeline of socialist construction. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has brought great impetus to the industrial and transportation fronts and further armed the working class ideologically. With the more in-depth implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, it will inevitably have a greater and more far-reaching impact on the industrial and transportation fronts. Secondly, under the guidance and encouragement of the General Line and the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, the new upsurge of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial and transportation fronts, with the many characteristics mentioned above, is coming like the Yangtze River, unstoppable and invincible. This is a great force. Again, material and technical conditions have also been further strengthened. It is estimated that there may be 600 industrial and transportation construction projects above the quota that will be put into production this year, and there are tens of thousands of small and medium-sized projects below the quota. The production potential of the original enterprises is also being further developed. Finally, to adapt to the new production upsurge, the arrangement and organization of industrial production and transportation tasks this year have been done earlier, faster, and more meticulously than in the past, and the command, dispatch, and management of enterprise production have also been generally strengthened. Our experience in organizing the leap forward and organizing the production upsurge is also richer. Of course, we will also encounter various temporary and partial difficulties on our road forward; however, we believe that the Chinese working class, who have never been afraid of difficulties and dare to think, act, and accomplish, will surely continue to give full play to their initiative and originality, overcome all difficulties, and seize new and greater victories.

The situation is very good, and the conditions are very favorable. How can we ride the waves to achieve the great tasks before us? It is necessary, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to thoroughly criticize rightism, boost morale, and launch a more in-depth, more extensive, and more lasting mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial and transportation fronts.

Bo Yibo said: In order to make the movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial and transportation fronts develop more magnificently, I would like to put forward several hopes and requirements to you and through you to all staff and workers.

First, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to launching mass movements, and further arm our thinking with the Party's General Line for socialist construction.

The basic spirit of the General Line is to mobilize the broadest masses, launch mass movements, to accelerate the process of socialist construction in our country. Through the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward this year, the majority of cadres and the broad masses of staff and workers on the industrial and transportation fronts have increasingly deeply understood the great significance of launching mass movements and have enthusiastically devoted themselves to this great movement. The representatives present here are the most enthusiastic leaders, supporters, and participants in the mass movement, and have made outstanding achievements, becoming advanced models. However, there are also a very small number of cadres who have adopted an erroneous attitude towards launching mass movements. They have endless worries about launching mass movements: believing that mass movements are fine for political revolution, but not for economic construction; fine for agriculture, but not for industry; fine for small industries, but not for large industries. They do not stand in the midst of the mass movement, but stand outside the mass movement, pointing fingers, making comments, and attacking the mass movement. They say that launching mass movements "disrupts production order, damages production balance, violates objective laws, and is reckless and arbitrary." The broad masses of staff and workers on our industrial and transportation fronts must thoroughly criticize these erroneous ideas and clear the way for the further in-depth development of the mass movement.

Facts are the best proof. Let us look at the facts since the Great Leap Forward. Do they prove that those who oppose launching mass movements on the industrial and transportation fronts are right? Or do they prove that the broad masses of staff and workers are right?

Can't mass movements be launched in economic construction? Not only can they be launched, but they must be launched.

Is it the case that mass movements can be launched on other economic fronts, but not on the industrial front? Practice has proved that not only is it entirely possible, but it is also entirely necessary. Launching mass movements on the industrial front has broken the mysterious view of running industries, jumped out of the narrow circle of a few people running industries, not relying solely on the state and a few leading cadres to run industries, but relying on all staff and workers, mobilizing all staff and workers to run industries; not only mobilizing the entire working class to run industries in the cities, but also mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to run industries in the countryside. This is the concrete method of following the mass line on the industrial front, a great revolution in industrialization methods. With the momentum of splitting bamboo, it quickly and thoroughly reversed the cold and desolate situation, making the socialist industrialization cause truly a vigorous mass undertaking, and thus the leaping progress situation of 66% industrial growth in 1958 and more than 25% industrial growth this year appeared. At the same time, from the perspective of industrial development this year, due to the continued launch of mass movements in the first five months, the situation of continued leaping progress has been maintained. It was only in June and July that a gust of cold wind blew up by a small number of right-leaning opportunists affected and confused the cadres of some enterprises. In these enterprises, the mass movement suffered some setbacks, and production declined accordingly. When the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose rightism, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, a new upsurge of mass movements was launched on the entire industrial front within a few days, and production rose sharply.

Then, is it only possible to launch mass movements in small enterprises, but not in large enterprises? That is not the case either. Modern large-scale enterprises have complex technology, fine division of labor, and high production continuity. These characteristics cannot be used as reasons why mass movements cannot be launched. Precisely because of these characteristics, the production and management of large-scale enterprises cannot and cannot be monopolized by a few people, and mass movements must be launched. Mobilizing all staff and workers, everyone using their brains, and doing everything possible to create new production quotas and overcome weak links can ensure the continuous leaping progress of production.

That kind of attack on launching mass movements on the industrial and transportation fronts, saying that it "disrupts production order, damages production balance, violates objective laws, and is reckless and arbitrary," is also without any basis. Since launching mass movements is a concrete way to follow the mass line on the industrial front and a great revolution in industrialization methods, it will inevitably disrupt the old and unreasonable production order. The question is, is disrupting this order beneficial or detrimental to production? We broke many unreasonable rules and regulations in the Great Leap Forward, and indeed disrupted the order of running industries solely by a few people using administrative orders in the past; disrupted the order that only emphasizes the role of material technology, only emphasizes the role of material rewards to stimulate production, does not pay attention to putting politics in command, political mobilization, and does not give full play to people's subjective initiative; disrupted the order that only emphasizes the role of experts and does not pay attention to the role of staff and workers. Both breaking and establishing, while breaking this unreasonable order, we have established a new order that conforms to the spirit of the General Line and is suitable for the needs of the Great Leap Forward, greatly improving the enthusiasm of staff and workers and greatly promoting production. What's wrong with that?

If it is said that launching mass movements damages the balance of production, it only damages the so-called balance of those who oppose launching mass movements on the industrial and transportation fronts, and disturbs their peace. In fact, launching mass movements not only does not damage the balance of production, but on the contrary, is changing the unbalanced phenomenon of "relaxing at the beginning of the month and working harder at the end of the month," with production being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, rising and falling sharply, and the new situation of "good start, every month red, complete success" in which production is rising step by step is beginning to appear. Production in the eight ten-day periods from early August to mid-October has continuously been higher than the previous period, month by month, and this trend is continuing to develop.

Launching mass movements also does not violate objective economic laws. Under the socialist system, the working people consciously and voluntarily labor actively, thus ensuring that the national economy develops forward at a speed far exceeding that of capitalist society. Isn't this an objective law of economic development? We launch mass movements to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working people to realize their own desire to develop production at high speed, which is precisely the concrete application of objective economic laws. Those who think that we violate objective economic laws do not truly understand socialist objective economic laws and do not understand how to use the superiority of socialist society. They only recognize the role of things, not the role of people, and therefore believe that since our country is poor and blank, this is not possible and that is not possible, so things can only be done less and the speed can only be slowed down, and the industrialization cause can only be monopolized by a few people, as if only in this way can objective economic laws not be violated. Our views and practices are completely opposite to theirs. Precisely because our country is poor and blank, accelerating socialist construction and quickly changing this backward situation has become the most urgent desire of the broadest masses. Based on this desire, we launch mass movements to the greatest extent possible under the material conditions, give full play to people's revolutionary drive, and achieve continuous leaping progress, which proves that launching mass movements on the industrial and transportation fronts is not reckless and arbitrary in violation of objective economic laws, but precisely conforms to the objective requirements of socialist economic development and is a great movement for the people to build their own new life.

Staff and worker comrades on the industrial and transportation fronts, let us hold high the red flag of the General Line, adhere to launching mass movements, actively participate in the mass movement, and resolutely act as promoters in the mass movement, so that the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy will continue to advance, wave after wave.

Second, carry out labor emulation more widely and deeply.

Labor emulation should have clear goals and concrete measures. The enterprise plan should become the goal of the emulation struggle. The broad masses of staff and workers should enthusiastically participate in the discussion and formulation of the plan, and actively propose various technical and organizational measures to achieve the plan. Each workshop, each team, and each work shift must understand the tasks they have to complete every year, every month, every ten-day period, and every day, and the methods to complete the tasks, and must check the completion situation daily and comprehensively.

Labor emulation is not simply about physical strength, but about improving production efficiency and reducing labor intensity through technical innovation and technical revolution. Combine hard work, practical work, and clever work. Many of the representatives present here are experts in technical innovation. We should have more innovators, and everyone should become skilled workers and technical innovators.

The forms and methods of labor emulation should be diverse. Such as inter-industry, inter-enterprise, inter-workshop, inter-team, same-work-type, and same-work-type counterpart emulation, and worker-to-worker opponent emulation. This kind of counterpart emulation and opponent emulation, because of their clear comparability, easily shows the difference between advanced and backward, which can promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to help the backward, and improve together. There is also the "one-dragon" emulation of upper and lower work types, which is convenient for strengthening cooperation in production and overcoming weak links. Labor emulation should be evaluated monthly and quarterly, and during the evaluation, political encouragement and material rewards should be combined. At the same time, organize large exchanges, small exchanges, large visits, small visits, large cooperation, small cooperation, and take measures such as "technical performance, sending treasures to the door" to promote the continuous upsurge of the emulation.

In the emulation, advanced production collectives and advanced producers should fully develop their leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. The representatives present here are all models in labor emulation. I hope that everyone will lead the masses well and learn from the masses, and constantly create new and greater achievements, like Comrade Meng Tai of Anshan, Comrade Yi Shijuan of Shanghai, and Comrade Su Guangming of Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, Comrade Xiao Peijun, driver of Hunan Shaoyang Prefecture Highway Transportation Bureau, Comrade Xu Xuehui, banker of Yunnan, and Comrade Zhang Baifa of Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, who have always stood at the forefront of the mass movement. The broad masses of staff and workers should also be more enterprising, learn from the advanced, thoroughly learn, authentically learn; catch up with the advanced, resolutely catch up, actively catch up. Let us have more advanced collectives and advanced producers.

In labor emulation, we must promote the spirit of collectivism, learn from each other, help each other, improve together, and move forward together. In this regard, advanced producers should wholeheartedly help their companions catch up to their level, which is a glorious responsibility. There should be no backward people next to advanced producers.

"One flower is not spring, a riot of color is spring." Advanced team collectives helping backward teams has formed a broad mass movement in Qingdao (and other places). In September alone this year, 2,002 advanced teams helped 2,063 teams reach the advanced level, making advanced collectives achieve a large area of harvest. This is the style of the Mao Zedong era. Every advanced collective and advanced producer should fully develop this style.

In labor emulation, pay attention to work and rest, pay attention to appropriate rest, avoid working overtime and rushing to produce, and do a good job in living welfare and cultural activities, so that the broad masses of staff and workers can always maintain vigorous energy and full energy to better carry out production. At the same time, make production safer and try to avoid accidents.

Third, vigorously launch mass movements in close combination with strengthening the Party's leadership over enterprises and improving enterprise management.

Continue to resolutely implement the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, and the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." This is our unshakable principle for managing industry. Countless facts have proved that after strengthening the Party's leadership over enterprises, cadres participating in production, and workers participating in management, the work of enterprises has greatly improved, the combination of leaders and the masses is better, the administrative work has been supported by the broad masses, and the work of administrative cadres is not worse, but better.

Bo Yibo finally said: The Party committees of our various enterprises must lead the political work and production work of the enterprises well, and always stand at the forefront of the mass movement and be good "navigators." The administrative leading cadres of enterprises must actively and continuously improve the command and organization of production under the unified leadership of the Party committee, especially the leading cadres must take turns participating in production, often go to the front line, understand the situation, discover problems, make decisive decisions, solve them in time, and often encourage the masses to strive for the upstream.

Comrades: The continued leap forward year of 1959 has reached the final decisive stage, and 1960 is also coming soon. The new year will bring us new and more glorious tasks. Time is precious, the situation is very good. I hope that after the representatives go back, they will lead more staff and workers to further implement the spirit of the General Line and the Eighth Plenary Session, muster greater enthusiasm, continue to launch mass movements, catch up ahead of everything, seize the time from the beginning, and seize the time from beginning to end, and strive to greatly advance and overfulfill this year's industrial production and transportation plan, and do all the preparatory work to strive for the continued leap forward next year!

    大搞群众运动，使生产高潮滚滚向前
    薄一波同志在全国群英大会上讲话
    新华社27日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波今天在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上作了题为“大搞群众运动，使生产高潮滚滚向前！”的讲话。他分析了当前工业、交通运输战线上的形势和任务，详细阐述了如何通过继续大搞群众运动，使增产节约的新高潮持续不断地向前发展的问题。
    他说：目前工业生产、交通运输的形势好得很。跃进的局面继续展开，增产节约群众运动的新高潮，正在一浪高一浪地蓬勃发展。我们的任务就是要更深入、全面地贯彻执行党的总路线，使已经展开的胜利局面和已经掀起的生产新高潮持续不断地向前发展，争取提前和超额完成今年的生产计划；同时做好明年生产的准备工作，争取明年第一季度工业生产按平均日产量计算、交通运输按平均日装车量计算，保持和力争超过今年第四季度的水平，并且，妥善安排今冬明春农业所需要的工业产品的生产，大力支援农业加速进行技术改造，以便为明年的工农业共同跃进打下良好的基础。
    我们工业交通运输战线上的全体职工，一定要把加速农业技术改造作为自己的光荣任务担当起来。农业是发展工业以及整个国民经济的基础，工业的发展和农业的发展必须互相适应。工业支援农业，不仅是为了农业发展的需要，而且是为了社会主义工业化事业本身的需要。农业的发展不仅将给工业提供更多的原料、粮食和建设资金，提供更多的劳动力，而且将为工业的发展开辟更广阔的市场，这也就必将促进工业的更大、更迅速的发展。
    党的八届八中全会以来，工业交通运输战线上的广大职工群众，以极大的政治热情和劳动热情，响应了党的“反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约”的伟大号召，大搞群众运动，在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地展开了一个增产节约新高潮。这就迅速扭转了今年6、7月间由于右倾机会主义分子兴风作浪使生产略有下降的状况，并且促进了最近三个月来的生产，一月比一月全面高涨。到今年9月底，全国工业总产值已经完成了一千一百一十四亿元，九个月的产值已经接近大跃进的1958年全年的工业产值；今年全年工业生产计划已经完成了76％。钢、生铁、原煤、发电量、金属切削机床、原油、发电设备、动力机械、拖拉机、联合收割机等主要工业产品1至9月份的总产量就已经超过了大跃进的1958年全年的产量。其它主要产品的产量也都有很大的增长。铁路货运量到10月20日止已经完成四亿一千六百万吨，为全年计划五亿二千万吨的80％，比去年同期增长了45％。现在可以肯定地说：今年工业生产和交通运输的计划，必将大大提前和超额完成。
    薄一波指出，这次在工业交通运输战线上，风起云涌、气势磅礴的生产新高潮、新形势，是在总结了去年大跃进、大搞群众运动经验的基础上展开的，它具有许多新的特点：第一，工业和农业、商业、运输业共同跃进；第二，工业生产逐旬增长。打破了过去月初生产总要比上月末生产下降的“常规”；第三，多快好省全面跃进。一般都达到了高产、优质、低耗、效率高、成本低和生产安全的要求；第四，在大型现代化企业生产飞速发展的同时，去年大量发展起来的“小土群”企业，现在绝大部分已经变成了“小洋群”，有些已经变成了“中洋群”，它们发挥了极大的威力；第五，增产节约的群众运动同改进企业的经营管理、大搞技术革新和技术革命密切结合。生产的组织领导工作，比过去更加踏实细致，做到紧而不乱，干劲十足而秩序井然；第六，把这个高潮同下一个更大的高潮结合起来，把当前的生产同下一步生产的准备工作结合起来。
    薄一波接着指出：现在摆在工业交通运输战线上全体职工面前的任务是：既要确保今年的继续跃进，又要为明年的“开门红”和“满堂红”做好一切必要的准备工作；既要实现工业生产的全面高涨，又要为加速农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，积极生产各种技术装备，实现农业和工业共同跃进。任务是非常光荣的，也是相当艰巨的。
    能不能完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务呢？是完全可能的。最根本、最主要的是，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，更加深入人心，广大职工进一步地认识了总路线的完全正确和伟大力量，深切感到总路线就是社会主义建设的生命线。党的八届八中全会又给工业交通运输战线带来了巨大的动力，进一步从思想上武装了工人阶级。随着八中全会决议更深入地贯彻执行，它必将在工业交通运输战线上产生越来越大、越来越加深远的影响。其次，在总路线和八中全会决议的指导和鼓舞下，工业交通运输战线上具有上述许多特点的增产节约群众运动新高潮，正像万里长江一样，滚滚而来。这是无往不胜、攻无不克的伟大力量。再次，物质技术条件也有了进一步的增强。预计在今年内投入生产的限额以上的工业交通运输建设工程，就可能有六百项，至于限额以下的中小型工程更是数以万计。原有的企业的生产潜力也正在进一步地发挥出来。最后，适应新的生产高潮，工业生产和交通运输任务的安排和组织工作，今年也比以往做得早、做得快、做得细致，企业的生产的指挥、调度和管理工作也已经普遍地加强。我们组织跃进、组织生产高潮的经验也更加丰富了。当然，在我们前进的道路上，也还会碰到这样那样暂时的局部的困难；但是，我们相信：从来就不怕困难、敢想敢作敢为的我国工人阶级，一定能够继续充分发扬主动精神、独创精神、克服一切困难，夺取到新的更大的胜利。
    形势非常好，条件又很有利，怎样乘风破浪来实现我们面前的伟大任务呢？就是要根据党的八届八中全会的精神，把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，在工业交通运输战线上更深入地、更广泛地、更持久地大搞增产节约的群众运动。
    薄一波说：为了使工业交通运输战线上的增产节约运动更加壮阔地发展，我向你们并且通过你们向全体职工同志提出几点希望和要求。
    第一，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，用党的社会主义建设总路线进一步地武装我们的思想。
    总路线的基本精神，就是要动员最广大的群众，大搞群众运动，来加速我国社会主义建设的进程。经过1958年的大跃进和今年继续跃进的实践，工业交通运输战线上的大多数干部和广大的职工群众，愈来愈深刻地理解了大搞群众运动的伟大意义，满腔热情地投入了这个伟大的运动。在座的各位代表同志就是群众运动最热烈的领导者、支持者和参加者，并且做出了出色的成绩，成为先进的标兵。但是，也有极少数干部，对于大搞群众运动采取了错误的态度。他们对于大搞群众运动有无穷的忧虑：认为大搞群众运动，政治革命可以，经济建设不行；农业可以，工业不行；小工业可以，大工业不行。他们不是站在群众运动之中，而是站在群众运动之外指手划脚，评头论足，攻击群众运动。说什么大搞群众运动“打乱了生产秩序，破坏了生产均衡，违背了客观规律，是胡搞蛮干”。我们工业交通运输战线上的广大职工，对于这种种错误思想，必须进行彻底的批判，为群众运动的进一步深入发展扫清道路。
    事实是最好的证明，让我们看看大跃进以来的事实，究竟证明是那些反对在工业交通运输战线上大搞群众运动的人对了呢？还是证明广大职工群众对了呢？
    经济建设就不可以大搞群众运动吗？不但可以，而且必须大搞群众运动。
    是不是在其他经济战线上可以大搞群众运动，在工业战线上就不可以呢？实践证明，不但完全可以，而且完全必要。在工业战线上大搞群众运动，打破了办工业的神秘观点，跳出了少数人办工业的狭小圈子，不是单靠国家和少数领导干部来办工业，而是依靠全体职工，动员全体职工来办工业；不但动员了整个工人阶级在城市办工业，而且也动员了广大农民在农村办工业。这是在工业战线上走群众路线的具体办法，是工业化方法的大革命，它以势如破竹的气概，迅速地彻底地扭转了冷冷清清的局面，使社会主义工业化事业真正成为轰轰烈烈的群众事业，因而出现1958年工业增长66％，今年工业将增长25％以上这样的跃进局面。同时，从今年工业的发展情况来看，前五个月由于继续大搞群众运动，一直保持着继续跃进的局面，只是在6、7月间由于少数右倾机会主义分子刮起了一阵冷风，影响了、迷惑了部分企业的干部，在这些企业里群众运动受到了某些挫折，生产就随着降了下来；而当党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大号召之后，整个工业战线上在几天之内就掀起了群众运动的新高潮，生产猛烈地升上来。
    那么，是不是只能在小型企业里大搞群众运动，而不能在大型企业里大搞群众运动呢？也不是。现代化大型企业技术复杂、分工细密、生产连续性高，这些特点并不能作为不可以大搞群众运动的理由。正因为有这些特点，大型企业的生产和管理，就更不是少数人可以包办的和能够包办得了的，而必须大搞群众运动。动员全体职工，大家开动脑筋，千方百计地来创造新的生产定额，克服薄弱环节，才能保证生产的不断跃进。
    那种攻击在工业交通运输战线上大搞群众运动“打乱了生产秩序，破坏了生产均衡，违反了客观规律，是胡搞蛮干”，也是没有任何根据的。大搞群众运动既然是在工业战线上走群众路线的具体做法，是工业化方法上的大革命，它就必然要破坏旧的不合理的生产秩序。问题是破坏了这种秩序，究竟对生产有利，还是不利？我们在大跃进中破了许多不合理的规章制度，的确打乱了过去那种只由少数人用行政命令办法办工业的秩序；打乱了那种只强调物质技术的作用，只强调用物质奖励刺激生产的作用，不重视政治挂帅、政治动员，不充分发挥人的主观能动作用的秩序；打乱了那种只强调专家的作用，不重视职工群众的作用的秩序。又破又立，我们在打破这种不合理的秩序的同时，建立了符合总路线精神、适合大跃进需要的新的秩序，大大提高了职工群众的积极性，大大促进了生产，这又有什么不好呢？
    如果说大搞群众运动破坏了生产的均衡，那只是破坏了那些反对在工业交通运输战线上大搞群众运动的人所谓的均衡，扰乱了他们的安宁。实际上大搞群众运动不但没有破坏生产的均衡，恰恰相反，正在改变着那种“月初松口气，月末加把劲”，生产前松后紧、骤升骤降的不均衡现象，开始出现了“开门红、月月红、满堂红”的生产步步高升的新局面。从8月上旬到10月中旬连续八个旬的生产，一旬高过一旬，一月高过一月，而且这种趋势，正在继续发展。
    大搞群众运动也并没有违背客观的经济规律。在社会主义制度下，劳动人民自觉自愿地积极劳动，因而能够保证国民经济以远远超过资本主义社会的速度向前发展。这难道不是经济发展的客观规律吗？我们大搞群众运动，充分发挥劳动人民的积极性和创造性，来实现他们自己的高速度发展生产的愿望，这正是客观经济规律的具体运用。那些认为我们违反客观经济规律的人们，他们并不真懂得社会主义客观经济规律，不懂得怎样去利用社会主义社会的优越性。他们只承认物的作用，不承认人的作用，因而认为我们国家既然是一穷二白，就这也不行，那也不行，因此事情只能少办，速度只能放低，工业化事业只能由少数人包办，好像只有这样才不违背客观经济规律。我们的看法和做法，同他们完全相反。正是由于我国一穷二白，所以加快社会主义建设，迅速改变这种落后状况，便成为最广大群众的最迫切的愿望。根据这种愿望，我们在物质条件可能的情况下，大搞群众运动，最大限度地发挥人们的革命干劲，实现了不断跃进，这就证明在工业交通运输战线上，大搞群众运动，并不是违背客观经济规律的胡搞蛮干，而恰恰是符合社会主义经济发展客观要求的，是人民群众建设自己新生活的伟大运动。
    工业交通运输战线上的职工同志们，让我们高举起总路线的红旗，坚持大搞群众运动，积极地参加到群众运动中来，并且在群众运动中坚决地当促进派，使增产节约群众运动一个高潮接着一个高潮地不断前进。
    第二，更加广泛和深入地开展劳动竞赛。
    劳动竞赛要目标明确，措施具体。企业的计划应当成为竞赛的奋斗目标。广大职工应当热烈参加计划的讨论和制定，并且积极提出实现计划的各种技术组织措施。每个车间、每个小组、每一工作班，都要了解自己在每年、每月、每旬、每日所要完成的任务和完成任务的方法，并且要逐日地、全面地检查完成情况。
    劳动竞赛不是单纯拼体力，而是要通过技术革新和技术革命，提高生产效率，减轻劳动强度。使苦干、实干、巧干相结合。在座的代表中有许多就是技术革新的能手。我们应当有更多的革新家，人人都应当成为熟练的劳动者和技术革新家。
    劳动竞赛的形式和办法应当多种多样。如行业与行业、企业与企业、车间与车间、小组与小组、同工种与同工种之间的对口竞赛，工人之间的对手竞赛。这种对口竞赛和对手竞赛，因为有鲜明的可比性，容易显出先进和落后的差别，可以促使落后赶先进，先进帮落后，共同提高。还有上下工种的“一条龙”竞赛，便于加强生产中的协作，克服薄弱环节。劳动竞赛要按月、按季进行评比，在评比的时候，要把政治鼓励和物质奖励结合起来。同时，要组织大交流、小交流、大参观、小参观、大协作、小协作，以及采取“技术表演，送宝上门”等办法，来促进竞赛的热潮不断高涨。
    在竞赛中先进生产集体和先进生产者要充分发扬带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。在座的各位代表，都是劳动竞赛中的标兵，希望大家很好地带动群众，并且向群众学习，不断创造新的更大的成绩，像在座的鞍山的老孟泰、上海的裔式娟以及哈尔滨机车车辆厂的苏广铭、湖南邵阳专区公路运输局驾驶员萧培俊、云南银行工作者徐学惠、北京市第三建筑工程公司的张百发等同志那样，一直站在群众运动的最前列。广大职工也要更加奋发勇为，学先进，彻底地学，地道地学；赶先进，坚决地赶，积极地赶。让我们出现更多的先进集体和先进生产者。
    在劳动竞赛中，要发扬集体主义的精神，互相学习，互相帮助，共同提高，共同前进。在这方面，先进生产者要满腔热情地帮助同伴赶上自己的水平，这是光荣的职责。先进生产者的旁边不应当有落后的人。
  “一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春。”先进小组集体帮助落后小组，在青岛（其他地方也有）已经形成广泛的群众性的运动。仅在今年9月份，就有二千零二个先进小组帮助二千零六十三个小组达到了先进水平，使先进集体取得了大面积丰收。这就是毛泽东时代的风格。每个先进集体和先进生产者都应当充分发扬这种风格。
    在劳动竞赛中，要注意有劳有逸，要注意适当的休息，避免加班加点突击生产，要搞好生活福利和文化活动，以便广大职工经常保持旺盛的干劲和充沛的精力，更好地进行生产。同时，要使生产更加安全，亟力避免事故的发生。
    第三，大搞群众运动要同加强党对企业的领导和改进企业管理工作密切结合起来。
    继续坚决贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，和“两参一改三结合”的制度。这是我们管理工业的不可动摇的原则。无数的事实证明，加强党对企业的领导，干部参加生产，工人参加管理以后，企业的工作大大地改善了，领导和群众结合得更好，行政工作得到了广大群众的支持，行政干部的工作不是不好做了，而是更好做了。
    薄一波最后说：我们各个企业的党委都要领导好企业的政治工作和生产工作，时刻都要站在群众运动的前列，当好“领航员”。企业的行政领导干部要在党委统一领导下，积极地不断地改进生产的指挥和组织工作，特别是领导干部一定要轮番参加生产，经常亲临前线，了解情况，发现问题，当机立断，及时解决，并且经常鼓舞群众，力争上游。
    同志们：继续跃进的1959年已经到了最后的决胜阶段，1960年也快来到了。新的年份，将给我们带来新的更为光荣的任务。时间宝贵，形势很好，希望各位代表回去以后，带动更多的职工，进一步贯彻执行总路线和八中全会的精神，鼓起更大的干劲，继续大搞群众运动，事事赶前不赶后，一开始就抓紧，从头到尾都抓紧，为大大提前和超额完成今年的工业生产和交通运输计划，为做好一切准备工作，争取明年的继续跃进而奋斗！
