Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th -- "Lao Patriotic News" published on October 8th a call to action from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front to commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Laos' declaration of complete independence.

The call to action stated, "In August 1945, after the surrender of Japanese fascism, the entire people of our country, under the wise leadership of patriots and Prince Souphanouvong, seized power from the Japanese fascists and established our country's first independent provisional government. On October 12, 1945, the provisional government declared Laos completely independent. This is an incomparably glorious day for our nation. This is the culmination of our nation's sixty years of united and heroic struggle against the enslavement of French colonialists."

The call to action stated that under the leadership of the former Lao Freedom Democratic United Front, headed by Prince Souphanouvong, and the current Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people have continuously promoted the tradition of opposing imperialism and striving for independence since October 12th, carrying out resolute struggles and achieving great victories.

The call to action pointed out that, however, American imperialism has always harbored the conspiracy to turn Laos into a colony and military base. They have increasingly intensified their interference in Laos, undermining Laos' path towards peaceful independence. In particular, since the Sanaikone government came to power, American imperialism has increasingly and blatantly interfered in Laos, especially by directing the Sanaikone clique and its lackeys to launch military offensives against Lao patriotic forces, attempting to eliminate this force and steal the revolutionary fruits achieved by the Lao people through years of arduous struggle.

The call to action stated that at present, American imperialism is strengthening military assistance to the Sanaikone government to expand the civil war and carry out brutal "sweeps" against the people. On the other hand, they are using the banner of the United Nations and the forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to attempt armed intervention in Laos.

The call to action stated that the situation in Laos is becoming extremely serious. The people of all nationalities and all walks of life in Laos must unite, resolutely struggle, and they will certainly be able to cut off the bloody hand of American imperialism, and they will certainly be able to force the government to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, return to the path of peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country, and bring a peaceful life to the people of the whole country.

The call to action concluded by saying that, based on our deep patriotic tradition and indomitable fighting spirit, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, our just struggle against American imperialism and its running dog clique will surely be victorious, just as our heroic struggle over the past fourteen years has been victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th -- TASS, Moscow, 9th: The Soviet "Izvestia," in commenting on the news that Laos is facing new threats from its close neighbors South Vietnam and Thailand, wrote that the reason for the serious civil war in Laos is none other than the result of the interference of the American imperialist bloc in Lao internal affairs.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to conceal this, so people from across the ocean are becoming more and more frantically attempting to push their "allies" onto the stage. This is necessary because the international climate has clearly warmed up recently. In this situation, it is very dangerous to openly engage in activities from a militaristic standpoint, especially since they have already been discredited in the eyes of the peace-loving public. "Izvestia" pointed out that the levers of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have recently been frantically activated. At the end of September, the advisors of this organization and the foreign ministers of the member states of this organization held meetings in Bangkok and Washington respectively. What was discussed at the meeting was not, as in the past, how to pull Laos into "the sphere of influence of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," but rather to discuss and formulate a plan for openly invading Laos, but this time not by the United States, but by some Asian countries.

It seems that the Thai ruling clique has decided to play a particularly active role in this rehashed farce. At the meeting held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, they demanded "immediate action" against Laos. This is another exposure of their warmongering ambitions. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense General Thanom Kittikachorn and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs recently demanded again that "the scope of activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization be extended to Laos." He also attempted to use Thailand's armed forces to interfere in Laos.

The formulation of plans for South Vietnamese armed forces to intervene in Laos has also become the focus of newspaper attention. A reporter for the British "Daily Telegraph" reported this news from Saigon, emphasizing that the South Vietnamese army of 150,000 men is "a more combat-effective army than the Cambodian or Lao armies." "Izvestia" concluded by writing that, obviously, this is an encouragement to the South Vietnamese ruler Ngo Dinh Diem, who is always trying to help his master sink deeper and deeper into Laos.

　　老挝爱国战线党中央发出号召
    斩断美国干涉老挝内政的魔掌
    苏联“消息报”指出帝国主义干涉是老挝内战的原因
    新华社河内10日电　“老挝爱国新闻”10月8日刊登了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会为纪念老挝宣布完全独立十四周年发表的号召书。
    号召书说，“1945年8月，日本法西斯投降后，我国全体人民在一些爱国者和苏发努冯亲王的英明领导下，从日本法西斯手中夺回政权，成立我国第一个独立的临时政府。在1945年10月12日，临时政府宣布老挝完全独立。这是我们民族的无比光辉的日子。这是我们民族六十年来为反对法国殖民者的奴役统治而团结一致地进行英勇不屈的斗争的结晶。”
    号召书说，在以苏发努冯亲王为首的过去的寮国自由民主统一战线和现在的老挝爱国战线党的领导下，十四年来，老挝人民不断地发扬了10月12日反对帝国主义和争取独立的传统，进行了坚决的斗争，并取得了巨大的胜利。
    号召书指出，但是，美帝国主义一直怀着把老挝变成殖民地和军事基地的阴谋，他们越来越加紧干涉老挝，破坏老挝走向和平独立的道路。特别是萨纳尼空执政以来，美帝国主义日益深入和明目张胆地干涉老挝，特别是指令萨纳尼空集团及其爪牙向老挝爱国力量发动军事攻势，妄图消灭这股力量，窃取老挝人民十四年来几经艰苦战斗所取得的革命果实。
    号召书说，目前，美帝国主义一方面加强对萨纳尼空政府的军事援助以扩大内战和对人民进行残酷无比的“扫荡”，另一方面他们利用联合国的旗帜和东南亚条约侵略集团的力量企图武装干涉老挝。
    号召书说，老挝局势正在变得极其严重。老挝各民族人民和各界人民团结起来，坚决进行斗争，就一定能够斩断美帝国主义的血腥魔掌，一定能够迫使政府严格履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，重新回到和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的道路上，为全国人民带来安宁的生活。
    号召书最后说，本着深厚的爱国传统和不屈的斗争意志，我们坚信，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，我们反对美帝国主义和它的走狗集团的正义斗争一定会取得胜利，正如我们十四年来的英勇斗争已经取得胜利一样。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联“消息报”在评论老挝面临着来自它的近邻南越和泰国的新威胁这个消息时写道，引起老挝严重内战的原因不是别的，正是美帝国主义集团干涉老挝内政的结果。
    掩盖这一点越来越困难，于是大洋彼岸的人也就越来越狂热地企图推自己的“盟国”登台。这样做之所以必要，还由于最近以来国际气候明显地转暖。在这种情况下，公开地站在军国主义立场上进行活动，是很危险的，何况他们在爱好和平公众的心目中本来就已声名狼籍了。“消息报”指出，操纵东南亚条约组织的杠杆最近狂热地活动起来了。9月底，这个组织的顾问们和这个组织成员国的外长分别在曼谷和华盛顿举行了会议。在会上讨论的不是像以往那样如何把老挝拉入“东南亚条约组织势力范围内”的问题，而是讨论拟定公开侵入老挝的计划，但是这次不是由美国出面，而是由一些亚洲国家出面侵入。
    看来，泰国统治集团决定在这出改头换面的丑剧中承担特别积极的角色。在东南亚条约组织举行的会议上，他们要求对老挝“立即采取行动”。这是他们好战的野心再一次暴露。泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬将军和外交部代理部长最近又要求“把东南亚条约组织的活动范围扩展到老挝”。他并且企图用泰国的武装力量来干涉老挝。
    南越武装部队干涉老挝的计划的制定也成了报纸的注意中心。英国“每日电讯报”记者自西贡报道了这一消息，他着重指出，为数十五万人的南越军队是“比柬埔寨军队或老挝军队战斗力更强的军队。”“消息报”最后写道，显然，这对南越统治者吴庭艳是一种鼓舞，他总是企图帮助自己的主子越来越深的陷入老挝。
