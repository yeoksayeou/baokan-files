　　伊拉克军事长官声明透露
    发现谋杀卡塞姆新阴谋
    新华社巴格达16日电　据巴格达电台15日晚上广播的军事长官阿卜迪的一篇声明透露，伊拉克当局已经发现另外一个企图在医院中谋杀卡塞姆的阴谋。他说，调查委员会正在调查这个谋杀案同一个星期以前暗杀卡塞姆未遂的事件之间的联系。
    阿卜迪15日在接见晚报“舆论报”记者时指责阿联在伊拉克边境集结军队。他说，在卡塞姆总理遇刺的事件发生前十天就已经得到消息说，“阿联已经派了一旅军队到伊拉克边境”。他说，“我们还收到关于在边境进行的敌对活动的充分的情报，例如训练志愿军、阴谋分子和叛徒。”他透露，在谋刺卡塞姆的阴谋发生后两天，摩苏尔当局已经逮捕了一个携带七十五包炸药和其它破坏装备的从叙利亚渗入的分子。他说，调查委员会正在加以讯问。对他进行的调查已经取得了令人满意的结果。
