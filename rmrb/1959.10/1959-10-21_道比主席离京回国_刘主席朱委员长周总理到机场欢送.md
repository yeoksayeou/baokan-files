Beijing

To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi:

    As we conclude our nearly month-long visit and leave the territory of the People's Republic of China, we want to express our gratitude, thanking you, Comrade Mao Zedong, and all the friends we have met, as well as the entire Chinese people, for your warm reception. The unforgettable days spent in China have provided us with many valuable and rich experiences, enabling us to understand the life of the Chinese people. Everywhere we felt the enthusiasm and high political consciousness of the Chinese working people, which enabled them to achieve a great leap forward and achieve unparalleled economic success last year. I believe that this visit will also help to further strengthen the friendly relations between our two peoples.

    We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, who have been tempered by decades of revolution, the Chinese people will achieve new successes in socialist construction, thereby promoting the prosperity and happiness of their motherland, which will also help strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defend the cause of world peace.

With comradely greetings,

István Dobi
Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic

    当我们作了将近一个月的访问，离开中华人民共和国国土的时候，我们要表示感谢，感谢您、毛泽东同志和所有我们会见过的朋友以及全体中国人民，感谢你们的盛情接待。在中国逗留的难忘的日子使我们得到许多宝贵的丰富的经验，使我们能够认识到中国人民的生活。我们到处都感觉到中国劳动人民的热情和高度的政治觉悟，这种热情和政治觉悟使他们去年能够实现大跃进并获得无比的经济成就。我想这次访问也有助于我们两国人民之间友好关系更进一步的加强。
    我们相信中国人民在经过几十年革命锻炼的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，将在社会主义建设中获得更新的成就，从而促进他们祖国的繁荣幸福，这也将有助于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平的事业。
    致同志的敬礼
