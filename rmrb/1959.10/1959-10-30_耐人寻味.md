Thought-Provoking
　　Zhang Shu
　　
Our ancient poets often advocated that poetry should be implicit, believing that "seeing through at a glance" is a great taboo, which is worth our reference. Please see Xu Hun's "Farewell at Xie Pavilion": "A labor song loosens the mooring rope, red trees and green hills, the water rushes swiftly, the sun sets, the wine wears off, the man is already far away, a sky full of wind and rain descends on the west tower." At first glance, this only describes the time and place, the sounds and colors, the scenery and actions, etc. However, through these, we can clearly feel the author's mood, which is not present in the words but is actually deeply contained in every line of the poem. This poem appropriately selects the heart-stirring action of "loosening the mooring rope" at the time of parting, selects the "red trees and green hills" that obscure the eyes, selects the "rushing current" that carries the boat away, selects the "wine" drunk enough to express the melancholy, and the scene of being alone "descending the west tower" in the "sky full of wind and rain." In this way, the author's emotions of parting are expressed.

　　This kind of work with "emotion beyond the scenery" and "meaning beyond the image" is indeed thought-provoking, giving people a deep impression after reading it. Some shots in movies also use this technique.

　　Let's recall the movie "The White-Haired Girl." The film reveals the essential difference between the old and new societies through a series of vivid characterizations, and these characterizations are embodied in the tortuous plot. What the audience sees on the screen are only exciting plots—Xi'er and Dachun's sincere love, Yang Bailao's suicide, Xi'er being snatched away, the Wang family being deprived of their land, Xi'er being humiliated, Dachun crossing the river to the west, Xi'er entering the deep mountains, the "fairy maiden" appearing, villagers worshiping, Dachun returning, Xi'er being saved... After watching it, in retrospect, we recognize the "Two County Chief" Huang Shiren's licentiousness and shamelessness, bullying others with power; Huang's mother's seemingly kind but actually treacherous nature; and Mu Renzhi's acting as an accomplice, flattering the rich and bullying the poor. At the same time, we also see Xi'er's tenacity and strength, Dachun's fortitude and courage, and the fine qualities of serving the people that the Eighth Route Army brought back from Hexi. After the audience recognizes these characters, they gradually grope for the above-mentioned theme. And this theme, which the audience has discovered for themselves, will firmly occupy their hearts.

　　The East German film "Colonel Colin" ruthlessly exposes the revival of Nazi forces in West Germany. However, it is done through the accidental encounters of an ordinary unemployed young man, Hopman, who has nothing to do with the Nazis, when looking for a job. The audience is led to the question of whether this unemployed young man can find a job. The audience accompanies him with sympathetic eyes as he walks down the street and enters the "Prince Hotel." Here, the audience unexpectedly sees those murderous fascist demons crawling out of the shadows, shouting wildly and drinking and making merry. As a result, the audience cannot help but be shocked and feel the seriousness of the problem. The film puts the extremely sharp problems in West German society on the "second line" of the plot, which is precisely the ingenuity of the artistic treatment. The film seems to be made specifically to describe Hopman's fate, and Hopman has no intention of believing in any fascism, he just wants to be a dining room director. It is only in the progress of the plot that the social force of fascism interferes with Hopman's personal destiny, and the film "has to" describe it. If the film had directly exposed the revival of the Nazis at the beginning, the meaning might have been diminished.

　　Turning the "first line" into the "second line," incorporating the foreground into the background, turning intentional description into objective revelation, letting the audience discover and chew for themselves, letting the audience unknowingly stand on the creator's side, loving what they love, hating what they hate, and letting the audience draw the conclusions that the artist has reached; wouldn't this be able to better achieve the purpose of ideological education?

    耐人寻味
    章抒
    我国古代的诗人往往主张写诗贵含蓄，认为“一眼望穿”是大忌，这是值得我们参考的。请看许浑“谢亭送别”：“劳歌一曲解行舟，红树青山水急流，日暮酒醒人已远，满天风雨下西楼。”乍看起来，这里只是描写了时间和地点，声音和色彩，景物和动作等等。可是透过这些，我们会清楚地感到字面上所没有而实际上诗中每一句都深深含蕴着的作者的心情。这首诗恰当地选取了别离时动人心弦的“解缆”的动作，选取了遮没眼目的“红树青山”，选取了载舟驰去的“急流”，选取了足以表现惆怅心情的“酒”醉，和“满天风雨”中独“下西楼”的情景。这样就表现了作者的离情别绪。
    这种具有“景外之情”、“象外之旨”的作品，的确耐人寻味，看了后，给人以深刻的印象。电影中的有些镜头，也运用了这种手法。
    试回想一下影片“白毛女”。影片在揭示新旧社会本质差别这一主题思想时，是通过一系列生动的人物性格来进行的，而这些人物性格又体现于曲折的故事情节中。观众从银幕上所看到的只是激动人心的故事情节——喜儿和大春的真诚相爱，杨白劳自尽，喜儿被抢，王家被夺佃，喜儿受凌辱，大春过河西，喜儿入深山，“仙姑”显灵，村民膜拜，大春归来，喜儿得救……。看过之后，回味之余，我们认清了“二县长”黄世仁的荒淫无耻，仗势欺人；黄母的貌似和善，内实奸险；穆仁智的为虎作伥，谄富欺贫。同时，也看出了喜儿的坚韧顽强，大春的刚毅果敢以及他由河西归来所带回的八路军为人民服务的优良品质。观众认识了这些人物之后，便逐渐摸索到上述的主题思想。而这个被观众自己摸索到的主题思想，便会牢牢地占据了他的心灵。
    民主德国的影片“科伦上尉”无情地揭露了西德纳粹势力的复活。但是，它是通过一个与纳粹并无瓜葛的普通的失业青年霍卜曼在寻找职业时的意外遭遇来进行的，观众被引到这失业青年能否找到职业的问题上去。观众以同情的目光伴随他走在街头，走入“太子饭店”。在这里，观众意外地看到了那些从阴影里爬出来的、杀人不眨眼的法西斯恶魔们在狂呼乱喊，饮酒作乐。于是观众不能不触目惊心，感到问题的严重。影片把西德社会中极其尖锐的问题却放到情节中的“第二线”，这正是艺术处理上的妙处。影片似乎专为描写霍卜曼的命运而拍摄的，而霍卜曼也无意于信奉什么法西斯主义，他只不过要当一个食堂的招待主任而已。只是在情节的进展中，法西斯这种社会势力搅进了霍卜曼的个人命运之中，影片才“不得不”加以描述的。如果影片开头就直截了当地揭露纳粹复活，那意味就可能逊色了。
    把“第一线”的变成“第二线”，把前景的纳入后景，把有意的描写变成客观的流露，让观众自己去发现去咀嚼，让观众不知不觉中站到创作者这边，爱其所爱，憎其所憎，让观众自己得出艺术家所达到的结论；这样不是能够更好地达到思想教育的目的么？
