Weinan, Shaanxi, October 28th (from our newspaper) - Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has overcome the most severe drought in twenty years this year, and cotton has generally achieved a bumper harvest. The 121,500 mu of "Qiuxiang Fields" cultivated by the county's 3,461 cotton planting groups achieved an average yield of about 272 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, more than 280 mu yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu.

The cotton field of more than nine mu cultivated by the cotton planting group led by Zhang Qiuxiang, a nationally renowned cotton planting expert, can produce more than 1,900 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding last year's output. Last year, only Xue Junxiu's group caught up with Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton yield. This year, Gao Zhenxian's group and Tan Chuanke's group have caught up with and surpassed Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton field yield; Xue Junxiu's group and Cao Zhuxiang's group are close to Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton yield. The one mu of "Qiuxiang Field" cultivated by Gao Zhenxian's group of Qiaoying Production Team, Huayin People's Commune, can produce 2,700 jin of seed cotton. In the competition to catch up with Qiuxiang, this cotton planting group conscientiously implemented and flexibly applied Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience. For example, Gao Zhenxian's group, based on the situation of this year's cotton fields having good inherent conditions (deep plowing, sufficient base fertilizer, and good soil moisture during seedling stage), adopted the method of "watering the bolls but not the seedlings" to effectively prevent excessive growth and boll shedding. The 1.8 mu of "Qiuxiang Field" cultivated by the cotton planting group led by Tan Chuanke of Yalin Production Team, Gushi Commune, can produce an average of more than 2,500 jin of seed cotton per mu. Tan Chuanke is an old man in his sixties. He personally sought Zhang Qiuxiang to learn cotton planting experience and conscientiously implemented these experiences in cotton field management.

In this cotton bumper harvest competition, Zhang Qiuxiang's communist spirit of helping others catch up with herself has been greatly promoted. This year, Zhang Qiuxiang traveled to nine communes throughout the county to impart cotton planting experience, and specifically helped ten groups including Xue Junxiu and Wang Hengxin, making the average yield of seed cotton per mu of these groups' high-yield cotton fields more than 1,500 jin. Zhang Qiuxiang's communist style has had a huge impact on the vast number of cotton farmers. Groups have promoted the spirit of mutual assistance. (Attached picture)

    张秋香棉田亩产1900斤
    渭南12万亩“秋香田”丰收，最高纪录亩产籽棉2700斤
    本报西安28日电　陕西渭南县今年战胜了二十年来最严重的旱灾，棉花普遍获得了丰收。全县三千四百六十一个植棉小组所培育的十二万一千五百亩“秋香田”，平均亩产籽棉二百七十二斤左右。其中亩产千斤以上的二百八十多亩。
    全国著名的植棉能手张秋香领导的植棉小组培育的九亩多棉田，每亩可产籽棉一千九百多斤，超过了去年的产量。去年只有薛俊秀组赶上了张秋香的棉花产量，今年赶上和超过了张秋香棉田产量的有高贞贤组和谭传科组；接近张秋香棉花产量的有薛俊秀组和曹竹香组。华阴人民公社桥营生产队高贞贤组所培育的一亩“秋香田”，可产籽棉二千七百斤。这个植棉小组在赶秋香的竞赛运动中，认真贯彻和灵活运用了秋香的植棉经验。例如高贞贤组根据今年棉田先天足（耕翻深、底肥足和幼苗时墒好）的情况，采取“浇桃不浇苗”的办法，有效的防止了疯长和落蕾现象。固市公社桠林生产队谭传科所领导的植棉小组培育的一点八亩“秋香田”，平均可亩产籽棉二千五百多斤。谭传科是六十多岁的老人，他亲自找张秋香学习植棉经验，并在棉田管理中认真执行这些经验。
    在这个棉花丰产竞赛运动中，张秋香帮助别人赶上自己的共产主义精神，得到了发扬光大。今年，张秋香跑遍了全县九个公社传授植棉经验，并具体帮助薛俊秀、王恒心等十个组，使这些组的丰产棉田平均亩产籽棉都在一千五百斤以上。张秋香这种共产主义风格在广大棉农中发生巨大影响，组和组之间都相互发扬了你帮我、我帮你的友爱精神。（附图片）
