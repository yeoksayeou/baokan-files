　　The Role of Astronomical Surveying in National Economic Construction
　　Xia Jianbai, Vice President of Wuhan Institute of Geodesy and Cartography

　　Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Its research objects are nature, the movement, distribution, and properties of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars, as well as the structure and evolution of the universe. Therefore, astronomy is a science with a very broad field. Now people divide it into many departments, each of which has its own independent scientific research scope. The astronomical surveying discussed here is based on two of these departments—spherical astronomy and practical astronomy.

　　Astronomical surveying arises from practical needs. For example, to develop agriculture, it is necessary to know the changes and alternations of the four seasons and the earliness or lateness of solar terms. For the convenience of transportation and navigation, it is necessary to know the longitude and latitude of ground points and the accurate time, as well as the orientation of ships at sea, and so on.

　　People usually regard astronomy as specializing in the study of celestial bodies far away from the Earth, as if this kind of research has nothing to do with our lives and economic construction. This view is incorrect. The application of astronomy is very broad and quite important. Without astronomy, the comprehensive development of human science and culture will be severely affected.

　　Providing Accurate Time

　　Soviet astronomer H.H. Pavlov once said: "Human culture could not exist without a correct and unified method of time calculation. Transportation, mail, telegraphs, wireless communications, manufacturing plants, factories, schools, academic institutions, and all citizens need to know the accurate time. In a socialist society that is already organized in a planned way, the problem of accurately measuring time is particularly important." Modern accurate time is determined by astronomical surveying; this work is called time service. Time service is to determine the recognized time standard. Time service is a huge international cooperative scientific undertaking that provides us with a standard time accurate to one-thousandth of a second. Such a standard time is not only the basis for millions of clocks and watches, but also occupies a primary position in many fields of science and technology. For example, the measurement of geographic longitude, the setting of standard frequencies, and the study of changes in the Earth's rotation rate all take time service work as the main body; other aspects such as gravity measurement, nautical and aviation astronomical positioning, similarly rely on accurate time. Accurate time is broadcast by time service stations through radio using "time signals."

　　Since liberation, the Xujiahui Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has done a lot of work in this area, equipped with large quartz clocks and a complete set of new time measurement and reception equipment. The number of time signal transmissions has increased from twice a day to eight times. The accuracy of time signal transmission, in terms of annual stability, has reached +0.0064 seconds, and in terms of stability within five days, it has reached -0.0015 seconds, which fully meets the strict requirements of our country's geodetic surveying work. In terms of organizing a national time measurement network, the Purple Mountain Observatory officially started time measurement work in 1958. The Beijing Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography are respectively preparing to build time measurement stations in Beijing and Wuchang.

　　Navigation and Piloting in Sea and Air

　　When sailing on the sea, other than water in all directions, one can only see the sun during the day and the stars at night, so navigators must observe celestial bodies to determine the position and direction of the ship. The same is true for airplanes in the sky; in clear skies, there is nothing, and pilots can only use the position of celestial bodies to determine the direction of the aircraft. Because astronomical surveying has such important uses in navigation and aviation, it has formed independent scientific departments: "Nautical Astronomy" and "Aeronautical Astronomy." Aeronautical astronomy is an emerging science that has arisen and developed on the basis of centuries of experience in using celestial bodies in navigation. Determining the position of ships or aircraft based on celestial bodies is one of the basic tasks of nautical and aeronautical astronomy.

　　With the advent of the magnetic compass, astronomical surveying has not lost its role in nautical navigation. Christopher Columbus, the famous navigator who discovered America in 1492, once said: "The only nautical calculation that is completely free of error is astronomical calculation; whoever knows the celestial phenomena is the lucky one." In 1819, Russian navigators reached the vicinity of an unknown land, determined their location according to celestial bodies, and thus discovered Antarctica.

　　In modern long-distance flights of airplanes, astronomical surveying methods must be used to ensure flight navigation. With the continuous increase in flight range, astronomical surveying methods will be used more to ensure the reliability and accuracy of flight navigation.

　　Modern radio navigation methods cannot exclude astronomical methods. The radius of action of radio methods is limited. Beyond this range, radio cannot function. At that time, pilots have to rely on astronomical methods. Astronomical methods do not rely on any ground equipment, nor do they reduce the accuracy of flight navigation with the increase of flight range. These two methods must be developed simultaneously in order to obtain a reliable guarantee of flight navigation under any flight range, altitude, and speed.

　　Exploring the Shape and Size of the Earth

　　The shape and size of the Earth are fundamental problems in geodesy and cartography. In this era, these data are also necessary foundations and bases for important theoretical research in the fields of physics, mechanics, and astronomy. This problem is solved by the mutual coordination of astronomical surveying, gravity measurement, and geodetic surveying.

　　The shape of the Earth can be studied according to astronomical surveying. This is to compare the results of astronomical and geodetic surveying to derive the deflection of the vertical. Up to now, one of the main methods for measuring and studying the geoid is by means of the deflection of the vertical.

　　Currently, research is being conducted on using artificial satellites to determine the shape and size of the Earth. The method is: first, measure the "geocentric coordinates" of many ground points according to artificial satellites, then reduce these observation results to sea level, and finally calculate the shape of the geoid from this. If the relative "geocentric coordinates" of many ground points are measured, and then the distances between them are measured using geodetic surveying methods, the size of the geoid can be determined based on the obtained two parts of data. This is the latest research direction.

　　People are now studying what kind of artificial satellite should be launched, and how far it should be from the Earth, to be most suitable for the measurement of the Earth's shape and size.

　　Very accurate measurement of the Earth's shape and size is particularly important in this era, because the aspects involved by this data are very broad, and its errors will cause serious errors in other problems.

　　Measuring the Irregular Motion of the Earth

　　The Earth's motion referred to here refers to the Earth's rotation. The study of the Earth's rotation has significant practical significance for many sciences, such as geophysics, astronomy, geology, paleontology, and geodesy.

　　The study of the Earth's rotation is generally divided into two main items: the determination of the position of the Earth's rotation axis and the study of the non-uniformity of the Earth's rotation. The former is achieved through the measurement of latitude, and the latter is achieved through time measurement. Time measurement can determine longitude and the non-uniformity of the Earth's rotation.

　　Geographic latitude is constantly changing, and these changes are caused by the change in the position of the Earth's rotation axis in the body, that is, the movement of the pole along the Earth's surface. In 1899, international organized latitude work began, using extremely strict methods and precision instruments to specifically study the fairly small polar displacement. International latitude stations are agreed to be located in the vicinity of 39°08′ north latitude and distributed across continents. China's latitude station was established in Tianjin in 1957.

　　The role of astronomical surveying in the national economy is also reflected in mapping and compiling basic star catalogs. In socialist construction, maps of various scales are the vanguard of various construction undertakings. Topographic mapping of a small area does not require astronomical surveying. However, when mapping topographic maps of larger areas, the cooperation of geodetic surveying and astronomical surveying is required to complete it. Basic star catalogs are the main tool for field astronomical surveying. The progress of science and technology has increasingly higher requirements for the accuracy of basic star catalogs. The existing star catalogs can no longer meet the new requirements, and recompiling basic star catalogs has become an urgent need in all aspects.

　　天文测量对国民经济建设的作用
    武汉测量制图学院副院长  夏坚白
    天文学是最古老的科学之一，它所研究的对象是自然界、天体日月星辰的运行分布和性质，以及宇宙的构造和演化。所以天文学是一门具有非常广阔领域的科学；现在人们把它分成许多部门，其中每一部门都有它的独立的科学研究范围。这里所谈的天文测量，是以其中的两个部门——球面天文学和实用天文学——为基础的。
    天文测量是因实际的需要而产生的。例如为了发展农业，需要知道一年四季的变化交替和节气的早迟；为了交通航行的便利，需要知道地面点位的经纬度和准确的时间，以及船只在海洋的方位等等。
    人们通常把天文学看做是专门研究那些离开地球很遥远的天体的，好像这种研究对于我们的生活和经济建设没有什么关系。这种看法是不对的。天文学的应用非常广，而且相当重要。要全面的发展人类的科学文化，没有天文学，将受到严重影响。
    供给准确的时间
    苏联天文学家H·H·巴甫洛夫曾经说过这样的话：“如果没有正确统一起来的时间计算的方法，人类的文化就不可能存在下去。运输、邮件、电报、无线通讯、制造厂、工厂、学校、学术机关以及全体公民，都需要知道准确的时间。在已经有计划地组织起来的社会主义社会中，对准确测定时间的问题尤为重要”。现代的准确时间是由天文测量决定的，这种工作叫做授时。授时就是定出公认的时间标准。授时工作是一项庞大的国际合作的科学事业，它供给我们以准确到千分之一秒的标准时刻。这样的标准时刻，不仅是千千万万个钟表的依据，而且在许多科学和技术的领域中，也都占有着首要的地位。例如地理经度的测量，标准频率的订定，地球自转速率变化的研究等，都是以授时工作作为主体；其他像重力测量、航海和航空天文定位等，同样都依靠着精确的时刻。准确的时刻是由授时台通过无线电用“时间信号”发播出来的。
    解放以来，中国科学院徐家汇观象台在这方面做了很多工作，配备了大型的石英钟以及整套的测时和收时新设备，时号播送次数由原来的一天二次增加到八次，时号发播的精度，以全年稳定度言，已达到＋0.0064秒，以五天内稳定度言已达到－0.0015秒，完全满足了我国大地测量工作方面严格的要求。在组织全国测时网方面，紫金山天文台已于1958年正式投入测时工作；中国科学院北京天文台和测量制图研究所正分别在北京和武昌筹建测时站。
    航海和航空上的领航
    在大海上航行的时候，四面八方除水以外，白天只能看到太阳，夜间则只能看见众星，所以航海者必须观测天体来决定船只的位置和方向。飞机在天空中也是这样，晴空万里，什么也没有，飞行者只能利用天体的位置来确定飞机的方位。由于天文测量在航海和航空中具有这样重大的用途，因此形成了独立的科学部门：“航海天文学”和“航空天文学”。航空天文学是新兴的科学，它是几百年以来在航海中运用天体的经验的基础上产生和发展起来的。根据天体确定海船或飞机的位置，是航海和航空天文学的基本任务之一。
    随着磁罗盘的出现，天文测量对航海领航来说，并没有失去它的作用。在1492年发现美洲的著名航海家哥伦布曾经说过这样一句话：“唯一的毫无错误的航海计算，就是天文的计算；谁知道天象，谁就是幸运者”。在1819年，俄国的航海者到了人所未知的陆地附近，根据天体确定了他们的所在地，因而发现了南极洲。
    在现代飞机的远距离飞行中，为了保证飞行领航，必须运用天文测量方法。在飞行航程不断增加的情况下，为了飞行领航的可靠和准确，将要更多地运用天文测量方法。
    现代无线电领航方法并不能排除天文方法。无线电方法的作用半径是有一定限度的，飞出了这个范围，无线电就不能起作用。那时飞行员只得依靠天文方法。天文方法不依靠任何地面设备，也不随着飞行航程的增加而减低飞行领航的准确性。这两种方法必须同时发展，才能在任何飞行的航程、高度和速度下，得到飞行领航的可靠保证。
    探求地球的形状和大小
    地球形状与大小是大地测量学和制图学中的基本问题。在这个时代里，这些数据也是物理、力学及天文学领域中重要的理论研究所必需的基础和根据。这个问题是由天文测量、重力测量和大地测量互相配合着来解决的。
    根据天文测量可以研究地球形状。这就是将天文和大地测量的结果加以比较而推导垂线偏差。到现在为止测定和研究大地水准面的主要方法之一就是借助于垂线偏差。
    现在正在研究利用人造卫星来决定地球形状和大小。方法是：首先根据人造卫星测定许多地面点位的“地心坐标”，其次把这些观测结果归算到海平面上，最后由此推算大地水准面的形状。如果测定许多地面点位的相对“地心坐标”以后，再应用大地测量方法将其间的距离量出，即可根据所得两部分的数据决定大地水准面的大小。这是一个最新的研究方向。
    现在人们正在研究放什么样的人造卫星，它应该距离地球多少远，才能最有利地适合于地球形状和大小的测定工作。
    很精确地测定地球的形状与大小，在这个时代里，格外显得重要，因为这个数据涉及的方面很广，它的误差将会引起其他问题的严重错误。
    测定地球的不规则运动
    这里所说的地球运动，是指的地球自转。地球自转的研究，对于许多科学，例如地球物理学、天文学、地质学、古生物学和大地测量学等，都有重大的实际意义。
    地球自转的研究，一般分为两个主要项目：地球自转轴位置的测定和地球自转不均匀性的研究。前者通过纬度的测定，后者则通过时间测量来达到目的。时间测量可以决定经度和地球自转的不均匀性。
    地理纬度是经常在变化的，而这些变化是由地球自转轴在本体中的位置变化也就是地极沿地球表面的移动所引起的。在1899年国际上就开始了有组织的纬度工作，采用极为严格的方法和精密的仪器，专门研究相当微小的地极位移。国际纬度站都协定设在北纬39°08′一带，并要分布在各洲。我国的纬度站于1957年设在天津。
    天文测量在国民经济上的作用，还表现在测绘地图和编制基本星表等方面。在社会主义建设中，各种比例尺的地图是各种建设事业的先锋。一个小范围的地形测图，用不着天文测量。而在测绘较大地区的地形图时，就要有大地测量和天文测量的协作才能完成。基本星表是野外天文测量的主要工具。科学技术的进步，对基本星表的精度要求日益提高。目前已有的星表已不能满足新的要求，重新编制基本星表已成为各方面的迫切需要了。
