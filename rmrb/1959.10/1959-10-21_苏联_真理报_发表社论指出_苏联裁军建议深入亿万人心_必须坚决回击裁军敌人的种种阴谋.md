Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th dispatch from TASS: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 20th entitled "Ideas That Penetrate the Hearts of Hundreds of Millions," stating that the historical significance of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, visiting the United States is becoming increasingly profound and fully apparent. Peace-loving people in all countries regard the visit of the head of the Soviet government to the United States as an outstanding contribution to easing international tensions and strengthening universal peace. In the eyes of all progressive humanity, this event is another major victory for Soviet foreign policy, a victory for all peace-loving forces, and this victory inspires the people of all countries to make new efforts to strive for a fundamental improvement in the international situation.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has won the enthusiastic approval of the people of all countries. This proposal has opened a new era in the struggle for world peace. The working people of socialist countries wholeheartedly support the new Soviet initiative. Everyone understands that true and lasting peace can only be guaranteed after the tools of war are destroyed. Therefore, complete disarmament is the best way to prevent new wars. Many politicians and commentators agree that complete and thorough disarmament will eliminate all the obstacles that arise when discussing partial disarmament and will clear the path towards establishing comprehensive and thorough supervision.

The editorial said that the expectations of peace-loving people in all countries have been particularly consolidated after the publication of the Soviet-American joint communiqué, in which the issue of complete disarmament was identified as one of the most important issues facing the world today. The leaders of the world's two major powers have expressed their willingness to do everything possible to achieve a constructive solution to this problem. During the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, the vast majority of delegations advocated the necessity of implementing complete disarmament. Currently, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has begun to discuss this issue as the first item on its agenda.

The editorial emphasized that, obviously, there are increasing signs in world politics that people are increasingly eager to realize international cooperation and to reach mutually acceptable solutions to the most important current issues.

However, peace-loving people in all countries cannot turn a deaf ear to the rampant activities carried out by those who oppose disarmament at this time. In the West, there are often some people who disregard the will of the people of all countries and put forward the old slogan of "Arm yourselves!" It is foreseeable that arms dealers, fearing that their profits from military orders will decrease, are launching a movement to obstruct the realization of the complete disarmament proposal.

The editorial concluded by saying that peace-loving people in all countries will vigilantly watch the open and secret conspiracies of the enemies of disarmament and give them a resolute rebuff.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论指出
    苏联裁军建议深入亿万人心
    必须坚决回击裁军敌人的种种阴谋
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”20日以“深入亿万人心的思想”为题发表社论说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国的历史意义日益深刻地和充分地显示出来。各国爱好和平的人民都把苏联政府首脑的访问美国看作是缓和国际紧张局势和加强普遍和平的卓越贡献。在全体进步人类的心目中，这个事件是苏联外交政策的又一重大胜利，是一切爱好和平的力量的胜利，这个胜利唤起各国人民作出新的努力来争取国际局势根本好转。
    社论指出，苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军的计划博得了各国人民的热烈赞同。这项建议为争取世界和平的斗争开创了新纪元。社会主义各国劳动人民欢欣鼓舞地支持苏联的新倡议。每个人都懂得，只有在销毁了作战工具之后，真正的持久和平才能有保障，因此，全面裁军乃是防止新战争的最好的方法。许多政治家和评论家都同意：全面和彻底裁军将会消除在讨论局部裁军问题时所出现的一切障碍，并将会扫清通向建立全面和彻底监督的道路。
    社论说，各国爱好和平的人民的期望，在苏美联合公报发表以后特别得到了巩固，关于全面裁军问题在这一公报中被确定为全世界目前所面临的一个最重要的问题。世界两大国的领导人都表示愿意尽一切力量来使这个问题得到建设性的解决。在联合国大会的一般性辩论的过程中，绝大多数的代表团都主张必须实行全面裁军。目前，联合国大会第一委员会已经把这个问题作为议程中第一个项目开始进行讨论。
    社论强调说，显然，在世界政治中出现了越来越多的征兆，证明人们日益渴望实现国际合作和就当前最重要的问题取得相互能够接受的解决办法。
    但是，爱好和平的各国人民不能对反对裁军的人在这时候进行的猖獗活动置若罔闻。在西方往往还有些人不顾各国人民的意志，提出“进行武装吧！”的老口号。可以预料，军火商由于担心从军事订货中得到的利润会减少，正在发起一个运动来阻挠全面裁军主张的实现。
    社论最后说，爱好和平的各国人民将警惕地注视着裁军敌人的公开和隐秘的阴谋，并给他们以坚决的回击。
