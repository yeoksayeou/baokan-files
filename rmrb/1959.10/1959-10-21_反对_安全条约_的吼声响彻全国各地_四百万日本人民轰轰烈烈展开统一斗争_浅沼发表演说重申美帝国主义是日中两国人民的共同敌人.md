Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: A total of four million Japanese people held an unprecedentedly large-scale seventh unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" across the country today.

Sixteen thousand coal miners and forty thousand metal mine workers took the lead in launching a 24-hour full strike starting this morning. Members of the National Chemical Industry Workers' Union and the All-Japan Seamen's Union held scheduled strikes.

Workers in national railways, private railways, postal services, telecommunications, synthetic chemicals, transportation, printing, and monopoly businesses held rallies and demonstrations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" simultaneously across the country. In addition, workers in many private enterprises and civil servants in government agencies also held protest gatherings.

Teachers stopped teaching and held conferences across the country. Students went on strike and participated in protest rallies and demonstrations held by workers in various places.

This unified action not only unfolded vigorously in the central region where there are more large cities, but also developed greatly in remote Hokkaido and Kyushu. The people of Hokkaido held rallies in seventy places, and the people of Kyushu held rallies in thirty places, against the "Security Treaty" and against unemployment and dismissal, and passed resolutions.

In Tokyo alone, people from all walks of life held gatherings and demonstrations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" in twenty-three places.

At present, the joint struggle organizations against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" formed by people in various parts of Japan have developed to more than 500.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party decided today that the Socialist Party will participate in the unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to be held across the country tomorrow.

The Socialist Party also decided to convene a meeting of trade union leaders from various industries on October 26 to strengthen the organizational structure for the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party also decided to support the coal miners' struggle against "corporate rationalization" and send a delegation to Okinawa to investigate the actual situation there.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, said in a statement today that Japan's security can only be guaranteed by severing Japan's military ties with the United States and establishing a collective security system in which the Soviet Union, China, and the United States participate.

Asanuma made this statement at a lecture held at Meiji University to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.

Asanuma told 1,500 university students that there are now 540 U.S. military bases and facilities in Japan. He said that Japan cannot be called an independent country with so many foreign military bases. He said that this situation should be ended as soon as possible.

The leader of Japan's largest opposition party also said: "The security treaty with the United States is itself a violation of the constitution. Revising this treaty means concluding a common defense treaty under the name of equality. This is to make Japanese youth shed blood for the United States."

Asanuma condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying the Japanese territory of Okinawa and the Chinese territory of Taiwan. He said: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people."

Speaking of the United Nations, Asanuma said that the United Nations should become a platform for consultation, not a place for disputes between countries. The United Nations should strive to realize Soviet Premier Khrushchev's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

    四百万日本人民轰轰烈烈展开统一斗争
    浅沼发表演说重申美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本各地共四百万人民今天在全国举行了规模空前巨大的第七次反对修改日美“安全条约”统一行动。
    十六万煤矿工人和四万名金属矿山工人从今天早晨开始率先举行了二十四小时的全面罢工。全国化学工会同盟、全日本港湾工会的会员们举行了定时罢工。
    国营铁道、私营铁道、邮政、电信、合成化学、交通运输、印刷、专卖事业等部门的工人们在全国各地一齐举行了反对修改“安全条约”的大会和示威游行。另外，许多私营企业的工人和政府机关的公务人员也举行了抗议集会。
    教员们停止授课，在全国各地举行了大会。学生们罢课，参加了各地工人举行的抗议集会和示威游行。
    这次统一行动不仅在大城市较多的中部地区轰轰烈烈地展开，而且在边远的北海道和九州也有了巨大的发展。北海道人民在七十个地方、九州人民在三十个地方举行了反对“安全条约”、反对失业和解雇的奋起大会，并通过了决议。
    仅东京一市，各界人民在二十三个地方举行了反对修改“安全条约”的集会和示威游行。
    现在，日本各地人民组成的反对日美“安全条约”的联合斗争组织已经发展到五百多个。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天决定，社会党将参加明天在全国各地举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”统一行动。
    社会党并且决定在10月26日召集各行业工会领导人会议，加强反对修改“安全条约”的斗争组织。
    社会党还决定支持煤矿工会反对“企业合理化”的斗争，并且派代表团到冲绳岛调查当地实况。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天发表谈话说：只有切断日本同美国的军事关系和建立有苏联、中国和美国参加的集体安全保障体系，日本的安全才有保障。
    浅沼是在明治大学举行的一次为纪念联合国成立十四周年的演讲会上发表这个谈话的。
    浅沼向一千五百名大学生说：现在日本全国共有五百四十个美国军事基地和军事设施。日本有这样多的外国军事基地，不能说是独立的国家。他说，应该尽早地结束这种状况。
    这位日本最大的在野党领袖还说：“同美国签订安全条约本身就是违反宪法的。修改这个条约意味着在平等的名义下缔结共同防御条约。这是要让日本青年为美国流血。”
    浅沼谴责美帝国主义霸占日本领土冲绳岛和中国领土台湾。他说：“美帝国主义是日本人民和中国人民的共同敌人”。
    谈到联合国时，浅沼说，联合国应该成为协商的讲台，而不应该成为各国争吵的场所。联合国应该努力实现苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于全面和彻底裁军的建议。
