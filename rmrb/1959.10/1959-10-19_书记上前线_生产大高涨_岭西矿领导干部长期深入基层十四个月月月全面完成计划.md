Secretaries Go to the Front Lines, Production Greatly Increases
Leaders and Cadres of Lingxi Mine Go Deep into the Grassroots for a Long Time, Completing the Plan Comprehensively Every Month for Fourteen Months

(Our report) The leading cadres of the Lingxi Coal Mine in Shuangyashan, Heilongjiang, have been going deep into the front lines of production for a long time, solving various problems of the employees and the masses in terms of ideology, production, and life at any time, making the leadership methods more lively and vigorous, so that the mine's production is often booming and constantly leaping forward. Since August of last year, this mine has comprehensively completed the state plan for fourteen consecutive months. This year, up to the beginning of October, it has produced 1,010,000 tons of raw coal, completing 87% of the annual plan.

The Party committee of this mine has firmly grasped the key to improving work style, going deep into reality, and strengthening the leadership of the team groups. Two of the three Party committee secretaries lead the heads of various departments to work in the team groups for a long time.

In order to ensure that all cadres in the mine have sufficient time to go deep into the front line of production, the mine Party committee first reduced the number of meetings. In the past, there was a small meeting every day and a large meeting every three days, so that the cadres did not have time to go deep into the front line of production. After streamlining the meetings, preparations were made before each meeting. Although the meetings were reduced, the overall work was planned every month, everything was arranged, everything was implemented, there were inspections in the middle of the month, and there were summaries at the end of the month. This ensures that cadres have sufficient time to go deep into the front line of production.

In going deep into the front line of production, they have found that grasping the advanced, grasping the weak links, strengthening the leadership of the backward team groups, and helping the backward team groups to set off a high tide of catching up with the advanced are effective ways to achieve large-scale high yield. More than 30 cadres of this mine went deep into the production teams and groups, respectively, and they adopted the method of "participating, observing, asking, listening, discussing, and linking" in the in-depth investigation (that is, participating in production, observing the production situation, frequently asking and understanding the situation of each team, listening to the opinions of the workers, constantly improving the work style, overcoming shortcomings, discussing problems with the masses to solve them, and establishing a contact system.) To discover problems in a timely manner and solve them in a timely manner. For example, when Shi Guoliang, the secretary of the mine's Party committee, and Zhao Tongli, the deputy mine manager, went deep into the seventh well, they found that a common problem existing in each coal mining team (group) was that the time for moving the chutes was long, the processes were not connected, and the coal could not be produced in three shifts, so the output could not be increased. However, the coal mining pacesetter of the entire mine—the 620 coal mining team, which had a monthly output of 10,000 tons for eight consecutive months—was able to prepare conditions for the next shift and produce coal in every shift. In response to this situation, the mine Party committee launched a climax of "learning from 620 and catching up with 620" in the entire mine.

The result of the leading cadres going deep into the front line of production, grasping the advanced, and grasping the weak links, made the advanced more advanced, the backward catch up with the advanced, the masses worked harder, and comprehensively improved the enterprise management level, realizing continuous leap forward. Because the leading cadres focused on the weak links, many long-term backward teams and groups have become advanced in one fell swoop. After the 612 tunneling team effectively solved the problem with the help of the leadership, it has increased from the original 30 meters per month to more than 70 meters. (Attached picture)

### 书记上前线　生产大高涨  岭西矿领导干部长期深入基层十四个月月月全面完成计划

　　书记上前线　生产大高涨
    岭西矿领导干部长期深入基层十四个月月月全面完成计划
    本报讯　黑龙江双鸭山岭西煤矿的领导干部，长期深入生产第一线，随时解决职工群众在思想上、生产上、生活上存在的各种问题，使领导方法更加生动活泼，从而使全矿生产经常轰轰烈烈、不断跃进。从去年8月以来，这个矿已经连续十四个月全面地完成了国家计划。今年，迄至10月上旬，已生产原煤一百零一万吨，完成全年计划的87％。
    这个矿的党委紧紧抓住了改进作风，深入实际，加强队组领导的这一关键。三位党委书记有两名书记带领各部部长长期在队组工作。
    为了保证全矿干部有充足的时间深入生产第一线，矿党委首先减少了会议。过去一天一小会，三天一大会，使干部没有时间深入生产第一线。精简会议之后，每次都做到了会前有准备。会议虽然减少了，但整个工作却做到了月月有计划，事事有安排，件件有着落，月中有检查，月末有总结。这样就保证了干部有充足的时间深入生产第一线。
    在深入生产第一线中，他们摸索到了抓先进，抓薄弱环节，加强对落后队组的领导，帮助落后队组掀起赶先进的热潮，是实现大面积丰产的有效途径。这个矿的三十余名干部，分别深入到各生产队组中去，他们在深入中采取了“参、观、问、听、商、联”的方法（即参加生产，观察生产情况，经常询问、了解每个队的情况，听取工人意见，不断改进作风，克服缺点，有问题同群众商量解决，建立联系制度。）及时发现问题，及时解决。如矿党委书记施国良和副矿长赵同利在深入七井时，发现各采煤队（组）中存在的一个普遍问题是，挪溜子时间长，工序衔接不上，不能三班出煤，因而产量上不来。但是全矿的采煤标兵——连续八个月月产万吨的六二○采煤队，却能为下班准备条件，班班出煤。针对这一情况，矿党委就在全矿掀起了一个“学六二○，赶六二○”的高潮。
    领导干部深入生产第一线，大抓先进，大抓薄弱环节的结果，使先进的更先进，后进的赶先进，群众劲上加劲，全面地提高了企业管理水平，实现不断跃进。由于领导干部大抓薄弱环节，许多长期落后的队组，一跃成为先进。六一二掘进队在领导帮助下，切实解决问题以后，已经由原来月进三十米上升到七十米以上。（附图片）
