Xinhua News Agency, 2nd October: The People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force warmly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    In Guangzhou, the leadership organs of the garrison held a grand celebration meeting. General Li Tianyou reported to all officers and soldiers the great victories of the motherland's construction over the past ten years. At the celebration meeting held by the leadership organs of the troops in the Shenyang area, Lieutenant General Shmilev, head of the delegation of the Soviet Far East Military District who was invited to Shenyang to participate in China's National Day, warmly praised China's tremendous achievements in various fields since its founding. At the celebration meetings held by various units of the troops in Beijing, Jinan, Kunming and other regions, officers and soldiers presented gifts to the Party, reported good news to their leaders, and reported on the achievements of the "Great Battle in September to Welcome National Day." The Air Force units stationed in Shanghai presented more than 700 inventions and creations from the technical innovation movement at a gift-giving meeting. At the ongoing Third Congress of Advanced Army Building Representatives of the Zhejiang Military Region, 281 representatives presented more than 100 physical objects and models of inventions and creations.
    During the festive celebrations, troops across the country joined with the local people to celebrate together. The leadership organs of the troops in the Nanjing area invited the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled and demobilized soldiers, and local Party and government leaders from Nanjing City to hold a celebration meeting. The army and navy units guarding Wusongkou joined with more than 10,000 workers, peasants, and students from the garrison, and the military and civilians rejoiced. In Zhejiang, the garrison troops on the Zhoushan Islands and the local people stated together at the celebration meeting that they would muster greater efforts to build the Zhoushan Islands into a maritime paradise and a strong fortress on the forefront of the motherland's coastal defense. The "Military-Civilian Amateur Cultural Troupe" of Dachen Island and Dongtou Island also presented brilliant performances for soldiers and residents during the festival. On the eve of the festival, the troops stationed in Guangzhou joined with more than 10,000 workers and students at the People's Liberation Army Square on the banks of the Pearl River for a celebration evening, singing and dancing together and watching fireworks. The troops on Hainan Island also joined with the local Li, Miao, Hui and other ethnic minorities to celebrate the National Day. The units where the "Tashan Hero Regiment" and the "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain" were located, while celebrating with the residents, dispatched propaganda vehicles and art troupes to the streets to publicize the victory of the general line and the achievements of the Great Leap Forward. The officers and soldiers stationed on Sanmen Island also slaughtered pigs and sheep, using their own agricultural and sideline products, to treat the militiamen and relatives who guarded the coastal defense alongside them. Many troops in Beijing, Shenyang and other regions also used the holiday to go to the farmland to help the people with the autumn harvest. A certain unit that eliminated a large number of Xiangxi bandits on the day of the founding ceremony ten years ago, went to the Changbai Mountains on the 1st, wielding sickles and joining the battle, and under the slogan of "Cut well, cut clean, and ensure a good harvest to celebrate National Day," they assisted the people in production labor all day long.
    At the same time, many troops stationed on the southeast coast were on duty with a hundredfold vigilance, protecting the people to celebrate the festival. In the unit where Air Force hero Jiang Zhelun was located, pilots were ready to take off at any time to intercept intruding enemy planes. Navy, artillery, radar soldiers, etc. were also sticking to their posts day and night. Coastal sentry He Jinbao wrote a poem during the festival saying: Holding the gun tightly in my hand, patrolling up the mountain; The top of the mountain is cold, the sea is shimmering with phosphorescence; The wind is blowing tighter and tighter, the waves are hitting the cliffs; On the festive night of the motherland, I am willing to stay up until dawn.
