Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th: The United Nations General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee concluded its discussion on the question of British Southern Cameroons on the 9th, and passed a resolution to postpone the plebiscite originally scheduled for April next year in Southern Cameroons by one year.

　　The United Nations General Assembly convened a special session last spring to discuss the future of French Cameroons and British Southern Cameroons. During this session, representatives from all walks of life in Cameroon petitioned the Assembly, demanding an early end to colonial rule and the merger of the two parts of Cameroon into a unified and independent nation. This just demand of the Cameroonian people received active support from African countries and socialist countries. Despite the obstruction and sabotage by the colonialist countries represented by the United States, Britain and France, the resolution on the question of Southern Cameroons finally adopted at the meeting agreed to hold a plebiscite in British Southern Cameroons in April 1960 to decide the future of Southern Cameroons. The previous session stipulated that the task of this session was to approve a series of questions to be submitted to the plebiscite and to decide the scope of participation in the plebiscite.

　　During this discussion, the vast majority of the committee members advocated for the rapid holding of a plebiscite, and that the residents of Southern Cameroons should be given the opportunity to express their will as soon as possible. Whether they are willing to merge into Nigeria, which will gain independence in October 1960, or merge into Cameroons, which is still under French trusteeship but will be allowed to become independent in 1960.

　　However, this effort was opposed from the outset by the representatives of colonialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. In order to safeguard the interests of British colonizers, the British representative put forward various excuses, attempting to prove that Southern Cameroons could not be granted independence now, and insisted on extending the trusteeship to 1962.

　　During the discussion, representatives from some African countries (Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Republic) put forward a compromise draft resolution stipulating that a plebiscite should be held in March 1961. Although the vast majority of representatives pointed out the shortcomings of this draft resolution, they still expressed their willingness to support it, because it was still a step forward compared with the British proposal.

　　The Trusteeship Committee finally adopted the proposal of the African countries with seventy-four votes in favor, zero votes against, and two abstentions.

　　联大托管委会讨论南喀麦隆问题
    决定推迟一年举行公民投票
    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会托管委员会9日结束了关于英属南喀麦隆问题的讨论，并且通过决议把原来决定明年4月在南喀麦隆举行的公民投票推迟一年。
    联合国大会上届会议曾在今年春召开特别会议，讨论有关法属喀麦隆和英属南喀麦隆的前途问题。在这次会议期间，喀麦隆各界人民曾派代表向大会请愿，要求早日结束殖民统治，把喀麦隆的两部分合并成为统一的独立国家。喀麦隆人民这种正义要求得到了非洲国家和社会主义国家的积极支持。尽管以美英法为代表的殖民主义国家百般阻挠和破坏，但是会议最后通过的关于南喀麦隆问题的决议中还是同意1960年4月在英属南喀麦隆举行全民投票，以决定南喀麦隆的前途问题。上届会议规定本届会议的任务是批准将要提交全民投票的一系列问题，并决定参加全民投票的范围。
    在这次讨论过程中，委员会的绝大多数委员都主张迅速举行全民投票，主张南喀麦隆居民尽快地获得机会表达自己的意志。他们是否愿意合并到将于1960年10月获得独立的尼日利亚，或者合并到现在还受法国托管，但是将于1960年被允许独立的喀麦隆。
    但是，这种努力一开始就受到了美英法等殖民主义国家代表的反对。英国代表为了维护英国殖民者的利益，提出了种种借口，企图证明现在不能让南喀麦隆获得独立，并且坚持要把托管延长到1962年。
    在讨论过程中，一些非洲国家的代表（加纳、几内亚、利比里亚、利比亚、摩洛哥、苏丹、突尼斯和阿联）提出了一项折衷的决议草案，规定在1961年3月举行全民投票。绝大多数的代表虽然指出了这个决议案的缺点，但是还表示愿意支持，因为同英国的建议比较起来它还是前进了一步。
    托管委员会最后以七十四票赞成、零票反对和两票弃权的票数通过了非洲国家的这项提案。
