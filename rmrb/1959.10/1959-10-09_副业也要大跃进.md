Sideline Occupations Must Also Leap Forward

“With the Commune's great power, there are many ways to make money. Impoverished mountain gullies are turned into gold and silver nests.” Since the establishment of the communes more than a year ago, He Shun County, which has always been relatively poor, has begun to become a wealthy mountain area. One of the most important reasons for the transformation from poverty to wealth is the great development of sideline production—sideline income has increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year. Why was sideline production able to develop greatly in this county? The most important thing is to put politics in command: Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over sideline production in various communes and production teams with sufficient strength, and have also solved ideological problems in carrying out sideline production.

Developing sideline production under the principle of not affecting agricultural production is beneficial to the country, the commune, and the individual members. However, some people cannot figure it out for a while, or they emphasize certain difficulties. For example, among some grassroots cadres and the masses, some people say: “We are too busy with agricultural production, where is the time to engage in sideline occupations?” Some people believe that: “It is enough to grow grain and cotton well, it does not matter whether or not we engage in sideline occupations.” Some people think that sideline occupations should also be carried out, but they cannot find ways to engage in sideline production, or they lack technology, etc. Some of these are ideological understanding problems, and some are practical problems.

Ideological understanding problems can be solved by reasoning and calculating detailed accounts. It is necessary to make everyone realize that: sideline occupation is one of the "five occupations" of the commune, and engaging in sideline occupations on a large scale under unified arrangements is by no means "not attending to one's proper occupation"; only by vigorously developing sideline production while vigorously developing agricultural production can we meet the diverse needs of national construction and people's lives; developing sideline production can accumulate production funds for agriculture and promote the development of agricultural production; developing sideline production can also increase income and improve living standards. He Shun County can serve as a vivid example in this regard.

Practical problems should also be addressed and resolved with targeted measures. Practical problems generally include the ways to engage in sideline production, the labor force, tools, funds, and technology for engaging in sideline occupations, the division of the scope of operation between collective and member household sideline occupations, the contradictions between agriculture and sideline occupations, the sales of sideline products, and so on. As long as we strengthen specific leadership and follow the mass line, these problems can be solved. The experience of He Shun County proves this point.

At present, the situation in the countryside is very good. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, a new upsurge of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy has been launched everywhere. The movement to achieve overproduction is being carried out vigorously in many places, and many people's communes are striving to increase agricultural and sideline production by more than 10% this year. In order to achieve this goal, on the one hand, we must put more effort into agricultural production, and on the other hand, we must mobilize all forces in sideline production. Winter is a good time to carry out sideline production. Seizing this period to engage in sideline production on a large scale can both increase this year's total output value of agricultural and sideline industries and increase the income of commune members; it can also prepare funds for next year's agricultural production and lay a material foundation for the continued great leap forward in next year's agricultural production. This is truly a good thing that achieves multiple goals. It is hoped that all counties and communes will tightly grasp sideline production like He Shun County, so that the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries will continue to leap forward, and that agriculture and sideline occupations will achieve a comprehensive great leap forward!

### 副业也要大跃进

    副业也要大跃进
    “公社神通广，进财门路多，穷山沟变成金银窝。”公社成立一年多，一向比较贫困的和顺县就开始变成了富裕的山区。由穷变富的重要原因之一，是副业生产的大发展——副业收入比去年同期增长了三倍多。这个县的副业生产为什么能够大发展？最重要的还是政治挂帅：各级党委对各个公社、生产队的副业生产用足够的力量加强领导，并且解决了开展副业生产中的思想问题。
    在不影响农业生产的原则下开展副业生产，是对国家、对公社和社员个人都有利的事情，但也有些人一时想不通，或强调某些困难。如在一部分基层干部和群众中，有人说：“农业生产都忙不过来，哪有时间搞副业？”有人认为：“只要把粮食、棉花种好就行了，搞不搞副业没关系。”有人虽然认为副业也应该搞，但是找不到副业生产门路，或者缺少技术，等等。这里面有些是思想认识问题，有些是实际问题。
    对于思想认识问题，可以采取讲道理、算细账等方法解决。要使人人认识到：副业是公社的“五业”之一，在统一安排下大搞副业，决不是“不务正业”；只有在大力发展农业生产的同时发展副业生产，才能适应国家建设和人民生活的多方面的需要；发展副业生产，可以为农业积累生产资金，促进农业生产的发展；发展副业生产，还可以增加收入，改善生活。和顺县在这方面可以作为一个生动的范例。
    对于实际问题，也要对症下药，加以解决。实际问题，大体上不外乎副业生产的门路，搞副业的劳动力和工具、资金、技术，集体和社员家庭副业的经营范围的划分，农业和副业的矛盾，副业产品的销售，等等。只要加强具体领导，走群众路线，这些问题都是可以解决的。和顺县的经验就说明了这一点。
    目前，农村的形势非常好，党的八届八中全会的决议公布以后，到处都掀起了反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的新高潮，很多地方超产运动开展得轰轰烈烈，许多人民公社都在力争今年农副业增产的幅度大大超过10％。为了达到这个目的，一方面要在农业生产方面多下工夫，另一方面要在副业生产上全线出动。冬季正是开展副业生产的好时光。抓住这段时间，大搞副业生产，既可以增加今年的农副业总产值，增加社员的收入；又能为明年的农业生产筹备资金，为明年的农业生产继续大跃进打下物质基础。这真是一举数得的好事。希望各县各个公社都像和顺县一样，紧紧地把副业生产抓起来，让农副业总产值继续大跃进，让农业和副业全面大跃进！
