At the National Day Reception of the German Ambassador to China
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Dear Comrade Matterne, dear Comrade Ambassador Wangdial, comrades, friends:

October is a month full of joyous events for the people of China and Germany. A few days ago, our dear German comrades just celebrated the Chinese people's festival with us. Today, we gather again to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, which cannot but make us feel particularly close and happy. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, to extend our warmest congratulations to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Government of the German Democratic Republic, and the German people.

The intelligent, hardworking German people, with their outstanding scientific and cultural traditions, have overcome various difficulties caused by the artificial division of Germany under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany for the past ten years, and have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism. Not long ago, the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic, proposed by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, not only pointed out to the people of the German Democratic Republic the path to carry out large-scale construction in order to achieve a comprehensive socialist victory in 1965, but also opened up a vision of prosperity and happiness for all the German people. We believe that the German people, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, will surely be able to victoriously accomplish this glorious and arduous task.

The German Democratic Republic is a peace-loving people's democratic state and an important force for maintaining peace and security in Europe. The German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Its international status is increasingly consolidated, and its international prestige is getting higher and higher. The unremitting efforts made by the German Democratic Republic to safeguard European and world peace and to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland have been praised and supported by all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the German people.

Comrades, friends: The development of the current international situation is increasingly encouraging. Three days ago, the Soviet Union successfully launched the third cosmic rocket to establish an automatic interplanetary station orbiting the moon, making new and great contributions to mankind's conquest of the universe. This is another great victory for peace and the socialist system. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and the proposal he made during his visit on general and complete disarmament, will have a positive and far-reaching impact on easing international tensions and striving for lasting world peace. We are deeply convinced that, as the entire international situation develops increasingly in a direction favorable to peace, the German question will ultimately be resolved reasonably on the basis of conforming to the interests of all the German people.

Comrades, friends:

On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our two countries, China and Germany, we are pleased to see that the fraternal friendship and cooperative relations between our two peoples have achieved extensive and comprehensive development. The people of the German Democratic Republic have provided sincere assistance to our country in its socialist construction with their superb technology. In international affairs, the government and people of the German Democratic Republic fully support the just struggle of the government and people of the People's Republic of China to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. Here, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I express my heartfelt thanks. Similarly, the Chinese people also regard supporting the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland as their unshirkable responsibility. Because we know that the stronger and more consolidated the German Democratic Republic is, the more guaranteed is peace in Europe and the world. May the friendship between China and Germany forever blossom like spring flowers on the lands of both countries.

I propose:

For the increasing prosperity and strength of the German Democratic Republic,
For the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Germany,
For the increasing consolidation and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
For lasting world peace,
For the health of Comrade Pieck,
Cheers!

    在德驻华大使国庆招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的马特恩同志，亲爱的汪戴尔大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    10月是中德两国人民喜事重重的月份。几天前，我们亲爱的德国同志，刚刚同我们一起欢度过中国人民的节日。今天，我们又来共同欢庆德意志民主共和国建国十周年，这就不能不使我们感到分外的亲切和高兴。请允许我代表中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向德国统一社会党、德意志民主共和国政府和德国人民表示最热诚的祝贺。
    聪明勤劳、具有卓越科学文化传统的德国人民，十年来，在德国统一社会党的领导下，克服了由于德国被人为地分裂所形成的种种困难，在建设社会主义的事业中，获得了光辉的成就。不久以前，由德国统一社会党提出的德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划，不仅向德意志民主共和国人民指出了开展大规模建设，以便在1965年取得社会主义全面胜利的道路，而且也为全体德意志人民开辟了繁荣和幸福的远景。我们相信，德意志人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，一定能够胜利地实现这个光荣而艰巨的任务。
    德意志民主共和国是一个爱好和平的人民民主的国家，是维护欧洲和平和安全的重要力量。德意志民主共和国一贯执行和平外交政策，它的国际地位日益巩固，国际威望愈来愈高。德意志民主共和国为维护欧洲和世界和平和为争取祖国的和平统一所作的不懈的努力，得到了世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的赞扬和支持。中国人民完全支持德国人民的正义斗争。
    同志们，朋友们：目前国际形势的发展日益振奋人心。三天以前，苏联成功地发射了建立围绕月球飞行的自动行星际站的第三个宇宙火箭，对人类征服宇宙又作出新的巨大的贡献。这是和平和社会主义制度的又一次巨大的胜利。赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，以及他在访问期间提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，对于和缓国际紧张局势和争取世界持久和平的事业将产生积极而深远的影响。我们深信，随着整个国际形势日益朝着有利于和平的方向发展，德国问题最终将会在符合全德意志人民利益的基础上得到合理的解决。
    同志们，朋友们：
    在庆祝我们中德两国建国十周年的日子里，我们高兴地看到，我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作关系获得了广泛的、全面的发展。德意志民主共和国人民在我国社会主义建设事业中，以自己精湛的技术，给予了我国真诚的援助。在国际事务中，德意志民主共和国政府和人民完全支持中华人民共和国政府和中国人民维护主权和领土完整的正义斗争。在这里，我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。同样，中国人民也把支持德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业和争取和平统一祖国的斗争，认为是自己义不容辞的责任。因为我们知道，德意志民主共和国愈加强大和巩固，欧洲和世界的和平就愈有保障。愿中德两国的友谊像春天的鲜花一样永远盛开在两国的土地上。
    我建议：
    为德意志民主共和国的日益繁荣和富强，
    为中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益巩固和强大，
    为世界持久和平，
    为皮克总统同志的健康，
    干杯！
