Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch. Yuexi County, Anhui Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of mid-season rice. 160,000 mu of the county's 210,000 mu of mid-season rice have already been harvested and threshed, with an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu. Among them, 79,093 mu have an average yield of over 1,541 jin per mu. The Xihe People's Commune has 3,000 mu of contiguous mid-season rice fields with an average yield of 2,200 jin per mu.

Yuexi County is located in a mountainous area with lower temperatures and a shorter frost-free period, so it has always had the habit of planting mid-season rice. At the beginning of this year, the county party committee seriously analyzed the new situation and favorable conditions, and strengthened the confidence of the broad masses of cadres and people in achieving a continued great leap forward this year. Then, throughout the county, a nationwide summary of the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was carried out, fully concentrating and developing the wisdom of the broad masses of the people, and further enriching the measures for increasing production. In the process of leading production, party committees at all levels paid attention not only to the specific implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, but also to grasping ideology and life, actively organizing visits and comparisons, holding on-site meetings, and carrying out production increase competitions, constantly inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, and ensuring the implementation of various production increase measures.

Yuexi County's spring plowing preparation work this year was done both early and fully. In order to prevent rice stem borers and rice leaf rollers, work such as picking up rice bags, plowing winter fields, and removing grass from field ridges was carried out last winter. While vigorously developing iron and steel, various people's communes also arranged labor to build water conservancy projects. Before spring plowing, improved varieties were also adjusted, tools were added and repaired, and a large amount of fertilizer was accumulated. As a result, time was gained, so that the rice transplanting season was advanced by 15 to 20 days compared with previous years, 800 to 1,000 dan of base fertilizer and 1,000 jin of green manure were applied per mu, and reasonable close planting of three by six inches was generally promoted.

In the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of mid-season rice, the county also overcame a drought that was rare in a century. In general areas, there was continuous drought for more than 60 days, and in a few areas it lasted for more than 80 days. The drought-affected area accounted for about 30% of the county's crop area. Under this severe drought situation, the broad masses of cadres and people, with soaring enthusiasm, fully demonstrated the superiority of the people's communes. On the one hand, they rationally regulated water use; on the other hand, they carried out large-scale labor cooperation. 75% of the county's labor force was invested in the drought resistance struggle. During this period, in addition to using the original water conservancy facilities, the county also dug more than 12,000 ditches and more than 1,000 wells, as well as other large numbers of water conservancy projects, so that the county's mid-season rice could still be irrigated in the event of a severe drought, ensuring a widespread bumper harvest.

Now, inspired by the bumper harvest of mid-season rice, the people of the county are actively strengthening the management of late autumn crops and stepping up autumn planting. They are determined to respond to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy with new and greater achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 10th. The Fude Management Area of the Xinglong People's Commune in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, achieved an average yield of 1,083 jin and 7.5 liang per mu on 548.76 mu of mid-season rice, an increase of 47.2% compared with the bumper harvest of 1958. Such a large-scale, high-yield harvest of rice is the result of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting energy, and launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party.

This year, when the leaders of the management area proposed the target of 1,050 jin per mu for mid-season rice, some people said: Before the advanced cooperative, each mu only harvested 300 to 400 jin, and last year's Great Leap Forward produced more than 700 jin per mu, and the increase in production has reached its limit. At this time, the Party branch led cadres and the masses to carry out a large-scale debate on whether production could be increased again and whether they dared to leap forward again. Everyone believed that although output had risen steadily in the years since liberation, the disparity in output between weirs and weirs, and fields and fields was very large, and there was still great potential for increasing land production. Moreover, last year there were already several mu of rice with an output of 1,056 jin per mu. As long as we work hard in this direction, we can achieve a high-yield target of more than 1,000 jin. Through large-scale debate, the 1,000-jin target began to take root in the minds of the broad masses of commune members, and everyone wanted 1,000 jin and worked for 1,000 jin. Then, the entire management area launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement led by cadres and with everyone participating, and every household accumulating fertilizer. Before summer planting, more than 160,000 dan of base fertilizer for rice fields were accumulated, an average of 260 dan per mu. Coupled with the bumper harvest of green manure, every mu had enough fertilizer. When attacking the third-class seedlings, some people were also lacking in confidence, believing that the panicles and grains had already formed, and there was no need to apply more fertilizer. Later, after calculating the increase in grain production and thoroughly breaking the "fixed situation" theory, the commune members boosted their energy and used the favorable conditions of green grass everywhere in the summer to vigorously develop green manure. More than 548 mu of rice generally topdressed three or four times, and finally eliminated the third-class seedlings.

The Fude Management Area is close to the river and has low-lying terrain. Although water conservancy projects have been built for many years, 235 mu of land in three low-lying weirs are still unable to produce high yields due to waterlogging. After communization, a large number of women participated in agricultural production, coupled with the unified allocation of labor, the management area dredged two branch ports, which greatly improved water conservancy conditions. In the past, even if 130 mm of rain fell, it would form serious internal flooding. Now, even if 300 mm of rain falls, it can be discharged in time. At the same time, due to unified planning and planting according to local conditions, the output of 104.5 mu of dead yellow soil after improvement has also increased from 500 jin per mu before communization to 990.12 jin, ensuring large-scale and substantial increases in production.

In cultivating mid-season rice, this management area has thoroughly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" from beginning to end, adapting to local conditions. They mainly focused on the following main measures: early sowing, early transplanting, early topdressing, early processing, and early baking of fields, so as not to miss the season, adhere to close planting specifications, deep plowing and sunning of the soil, and apply sufficient base fertilizer.

　　岳西十六万亩中稻亩产超千斤
    扬中出现中稻千斤管理区
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽岳西县中稻大丰收。全县二十一万亩中稻已经收割脱粒十六万亩，平均亩产一千一百斤，其中平均亩产一千五百四十一斤以上的有七万九千零九十三亩。溪河人民公社三千亩连片中稻，平均亩产二千二百斤。　　岳西县地处山区，气温较低，无霜期短，一向有种中稻习惯。今年一开春，县委就认真地分析了新的形势和有利条件，坚定了广大干部和群众实现今年继续大跃进的信心。接着又在全县范围内，对1958年大跃进的经验，进行了全民性总结，充分地集中和发挥了广大群众的智慧，进一步充实了增产措施。在领导生产的过程中，各级党委既注意具体贯彻农业“八字宪法”，又注意抓思想、抓生活，积极组织参观评比、召开现场会议和开展增产竞赛，不断鼓舞广大群众的干劲，保证了各项增产措施的贯彻实现。
    岳西县今年的春耕准备工作做得既早又充分。为防治稻苞虫、稻螟虫，去冬就进行了拾稻兜、犁冬板、和清除田埂垛草等工作。各人民公社在大办钢铁的同时，还安排劳力兴修了水利工程。在备耕前又调剂了良种，添修了工具；积造了大批肥料。因而争取了时间，使插秧季节比往年提早了十五至二十天，每亩施基肥八百到一千担，绿肥一千斤，普遍推行了三乘六寸合理密植。
    在争取中稻丰收的斗争中，全县还战胜了百年少有的干旱，一般地区连续干旱六十多天，少数地区达八十余天，受旱面积占全县农作物面积的30％左右。在这严重旱情下，广大干部、群众以冲天干劲，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，一方面合理调节用水；另方面开展劳力大协作。全县75％的劳力都投入抗旱斗争。在这一段时间，全县除动用原有的水利设施外，还开挖了一万二千多条水沟和一千多眼水井以及其他的大批水利工程，因而使全县中稻在严重干旱的情况下仍然有水灌溉，保证了普遍大丰收。
    现在，全县人民在中稻大丰收的鼓舞下，正在积极加强晚秋作物的管理和加紧秋种，他们决心用更新更大的成绩，来响应党的增产节约号召。
    新华社南京10日电　江苏扬中县兴隆人民公社福德管理区五百四十八点七六亩中稻平均亩产一千零八十三斤七两半，比大丰收的1958年增长47.2％。这样大面积的水稻高额丰收，是在党的领导下，反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动的结果。
    今年当管理区领导上提出中稻亩产一千零五十斤指标时，有些人说：高级社以前，每亩只收三四百斤，去年大跃进，亩产七百多斤，增产已经到顶了。这时，党支部就领导干部和群众开展能不能再增产、敢不敢再跃进的大辩论。大家认为，解放几年来，产量虽然节节上升，但是，圩与圩、田与田之间产量高低悬殊很大，土地增产仍有很大潜力。并且，去年已经有几亩水稻每亩产量达到一千零五十六斤，只要向这个方向努力，就能实现一千多斤的高产指标。通过大辩论，千斤指标开始在广大社员思想上扎根，人人想千斤，干千斤。接着，全管理区开展了一个干部带头，人人动手，户户积肥的声势浩大的积肥运动，在夏栽前就积了稻田基肥十六万多担，平均每亩二百六十担，加上绿肥大丰收，亩亩都上足了肥料。猛攻三类苗时，也有人信心不足，认为穗、粒已经形成，无需再追肥。后来经过算增产粮食账，大破“定局”论，社员们鼓足干劲，利用夏天遍地皆青的有利条件，大搞青草肥，五百四十八亩多水稻普遍追肥三、四次，终于消灭了三类苗。
    福德管理区靠近江边，地势低洼，虽经多年兴修水利，仍有三个低洼圩的二百三十五亩田受涝不能高产。公社化后，大批妇女参加农业生产，加上统一调配劳力，管理区开浚了两条支港，使水利条件大大改善，过去连下一百三十毫米雨就形成严重内涝，现在连下三百毫米雨也能及时排泄。同时，由于统一规划，因地种植，一百零四点五亩死黄土经过改良后产量也由公社化前的亩产五百斤提高到九百九十点一二斤，保证了大面积和大幅度的增产。
    这个管理区在培育中稻中，自始至终因地制宜地全面贯彻了“八字宪法”。他们主要抓住以下几个主要措施：早播种、早栽秧，早追肥，早加工，早烤田，做到不误季节，坚持密植规格，深翻晒垡，施足基肥。
