　　Support the Just Demands of the Spanish People
　　Editor:
　　After reading the news in the "People's Daily" on September 27th about the Spanish Communist Party and other progressive forces launching a campaign to win amnesty for political prisoners and exiles, all of us in the Spanish language group unanimously expressed our firm support for this legitimate demand of the Spanish people and protested against the inhumane persecution carried out by the Spanish authorities. We call for the Franco authorities to immediately grant amnesty to all political prisoners imprisoned and exiled abroad.
　　Since Franco seized power in 1939, he has implemented a dark fascist rule in the country, wantonly destroying democracy and freedom, and bloodily persecuting progressives, causing the Spanish people to suffer endless torment and suffering. Twenty years have passed since the end of the Spanish Civil War. Over the past twenty years, the Franco government has imprisoned thousands upon thousands of political prisoners and forced thousands of patriotic people to live in exile abroad for many years, preventing them from returning to their beloved motherland. How can this be tolerated? What is especially infuriating is that these political prisoners are being brutally harmed and thrown into prison simply because they have contributed their strength to the independence of the motherland and the freedom and happiness of the people.
　　Today's world is no longer the world of twenty years ago. Now the waves of the peace movement and the national liberation movement are growing stronger. The call for peace, democracy, and freedom resounds throughout the world. However, the Spanish authorities brazenly disregard the demands of the people at home and abroad and have adopted even more cruel means of suppression. On July 28th, they even forced the parliament to pass the even more terrifying "Social Order Law" and attempted to murder Simon Sanchez Montero, the loyal son of the Spanish people. But batons cannot extinguish the volcano of anger. More and more Spanish people have joined the struggle against terrorism. The momentum of the movement for democracy and freedom is growing stronger day by day.
　　We, all the comrades in the Spanish language group, hereby express our firm support for this just struggle of the Spanish people. We angrily protest against the bloody suppression by the Franco authorities and firmly demand amnesty for all imprisoned and exiled political prisoners.

　　支持西班牙人民的合理要求编辑同志：
    看了9月27日“人民日报”上登载的西班牙共产党等进步力量发动争取大赦政治犯和流亡者的消息以后。我们西班牙文组全体同志一致表示坚决支持西班牙人民这一合理要求，抗议西班牙当局采取的惨无人道的迫害行动。我们呼吁，要求佛朗哥当局立即大赦被监禁和流亡在外的所有政治犯。
    自1939年佛朗哥夺取政权以后，便在国内实行了暗无天日的法西斯统治，对民主自由肆意摧残，对进步人士血腥迫害，使西班牙人民受尽了折磨和苦难。西班牙内战结束至今已二十年了。二十年来佛朗哥政府囚禁了成千上万的政治犯，并迫使数以千计的爱国志士长年流亡国外，使他们不能回到自己心爱的祖国。这怎能令人容忍呢？尤其使人愤慨的是：这些政治犯之所以横遭残害，之所以被投进监狱，仅仅是因为他们为祖国的独立，为人民的自由和幸福贡献过自己的力量。
    今日世界已非二十年前的世界。现在和平运动和民族解放运动的波澜正日益壮阔。要求和平、民主和自由的呼声响彻了全世界。然而西班牙当局竟悍然不顾国内外人民的要求，采取了更加残酷的镇压手段。7月28日竟又迫使议会通过了更加恐怖的“社会秩序法”，并且企图谋害西班牙人民忠实的儿子西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗。但警棍是扑不灭愤怒的火山的。愈来愈多的西班牙人民投入了反恐怖活动的斗争。争民主争自由运动的声势更逐日壮大了。
    我们西班牙文组全体同志，在此表示坚决支持西班牙人民这一正义斗争。愤怒抗议佛朗哥当局的血腥镇压，坚决要求大赦所有被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯。
