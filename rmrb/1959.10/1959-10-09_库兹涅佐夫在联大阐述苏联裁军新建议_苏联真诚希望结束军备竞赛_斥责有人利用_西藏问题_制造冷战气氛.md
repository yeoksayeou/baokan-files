Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th: TASS reports: Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly, spoke in the general debate of the plenary session on the 6th. In his speech, he elaborated on the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, sternly condemned the conspiracy to force the General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Tibet issue," and stated that the Soviet Union would propose new suggestions on the study of outer space.

Kuznetsov said that Soviet Premier Khrushchev's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 18th profoundly analyzed the current international situation. He comprehensively argued that the most urgent and mature issue at present is disarmament, and submitted the Soviet government's declaration on complete and thorough disarmament to the United Nations for discussion. Kuznetsov said that the Soviet proposal has been warmly embraced by the broad masses of people in various countries because it expresses the desire of the people of all countries to eliminate war from human relations. However, the Soviet disarmament proposal has not evoked universally positive reactions. Those forces that advocate continuing the "Cold War" and the arms race are not only enemies of complete and thorough disarmament, but also enemies of any disarmament measures.

Kuznetsov also refuted the unfounded argument that complete and thorough disarmament would only benefit the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. Kuznetsov said that the starting point for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is a sincere hope to end the arms race and enable the people of all countries to breathe freely and free themselves from the constant threat of new destructive wars. If other countries also have a sincere desire to achieve this goal, then there is no reason to fear saying goodbye to cannons, bombs, submarines, rocket weapons, germ weapons, and chemical weapons, etc. The people of the whole world will benefit from this without exception.

Kuznetsov reiterated that the Soviet government believes that its proposed plan for complete and thorough disarmament is entirely feasible, but it is by no means operating on the principle of "either solving everything or not moving at all." If Western countries are not yet willing to completely and thoroughly disarm, then the Soviet government, as in the past, is willing to reach agreements with other countries on corresponding partial measures for disarmament and the consolidation of security. As a result of the lengthy negotiations in Geneva, the attitudes of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom towards the issue of halting nuclear weapons tests have become somewhat closer. The Soviet Union believes that all prerequisites now exist for the conclusion of an agreement on this issue in the near future. The Soviet delegation cannot but express its regret that U.S. Secretary of State Herter distorted the truth of the Geneva negotiations in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 17th.

Speaking of the so-called "Tibet issue," Kuznetsov said that the attempt to force this session of the General Assembly to discuss issues such as the so-called "Tibet issue" proves that certain groups are trying to hinder the establishment of a serious atmosphere in the United Nations. Those who secretly direct Ireland and Malaya want to maintain the "Cold War" atmosphere by all means. This is a crude trampling on the principles of the United Nations, thereby seriously undermining its prestige. The United Nations General Assembly should resist attempts to use the United Nations to exacerbate international relations. Our duty is to strive to promote the normalization of the international situation and to maintain and strengthen universal peace.

Kuznetsov continued, currently, the issue of studying outer space is attracting more and more attention. Now, the boldest ideals of flying to other celestial bodies are becoming reality. The automatic interplanetary station recently launched into space by the Soviet Union is such a step. Kuznetsov emphasized that in the study of outer space and the use of outer space for the benefit of mankind, it is necessary to ensure the broadest possible equal cooperation among countries. Considering that the exchange of experience in scientific research achievements helps to accelerate research in outer space, the Soviet government intends to propose a suggestion: to convene an international conference of scientists under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss the exchange of experience in the study of outer space.

Kuznetsov concluded by saying that recently, there has been a tendency towards easing international tensions and normalizing relations between countries, and national leaders are increasingly beginning to realize the necessity of implementing a policy of peaceful coexistence and resolving international disputes through negotiations. It should be pointed out once again that Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States and U.S. President Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union have made outstanding contributions to the cause of establishing the principles of peaceful coexistence. In the joint communiqué issued after the talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower at Camp David, both sides agreed that the resolution of all outstanding international issues should not involve the use of force, but should be resolved by peaceful means through negotiations, which undoubtedly has great significance for the future development of international relations. All countries and all peoples should make efforts to achieve a great goal - ensuring lasting and solid peace.

    库兹涅佐夫在联大阐述苏联裁军新建议
    苏联真诚希望结束军备竞赛
    斥责有人利用“西藏问题”制造冷战气氛
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国大会第十四届会议的苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫6日在大会全体会议的一般性辩论中发言。他在发言中详细地论述了苏联政府提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，严词斥责那种企图强迫大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”的阴谋，并且表示苏联将就研究宇宙空间问题提出新建议。
    库兹涅佐夫说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9月18日在联合国大会的演说中深刻地分析了当前的国际局势。他全面地论证了这样一个结论：当前最迫切的和业已成熟的问题是裁军问题，并且把苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军宣言提交联合国讨论。库兹涅佐夫说，苏联这个建议受到世界各国广大群众的热烈拥护，因为这项建议表达了各国人民的愿望——从人类关系中排除战争。但是苏联的裁军建议所引起的并不都是良好的反应。那些主张继续进行“冷战”和军备竞赛的势力，不仅是全面和彻底裁军的敌人，而且也是任何裁军措施的敌人。
    库兹涅佐夫还驳斥了那种毫无根据的论调，就是所谓全面和彻底裁军只对苏联和社会主义阵营有利。库兹涅佐夫说，苏联建议实行全面和彻底裁军的出发点是真诚希望结束军备竞赛并使各国人民能够舒畅地呼吸和摆脱经常威胁他们的新的毁灭性战争危险。如果其他国家也有达到这种目的的真诚愿望，那末就没有什么理由害怕同大炮、炸弹、潜水艇、火箭武器、细菌武器和化学武器等等告别。全世界人民都会无例外地从这里得到好处。
    库兹涅佐夫重申，苏联政府认为它提出的全面和彻底裁军计划是完全可以实现的，但它决不是本着“要么全部解决，要么丝毫不动”的原则行事。如果西方国家现在还不愿意全面和彻底裁军，那么苏联政府也像过去一样，愿意同其他国家就裁军和巩固安全的相应局部措施达成协议。由于在日内瓦举行了长时间的谈判，苏联、美国和英国对停止核武器试验问题的态度已经有了某种程度的接近。苏联认为，现在有一切前提在最近就这个问题签订协定。苏联代表团不能不表示遗憾的是，美国国务卿赫脱9月17日在联合国大会的发言中歪曲了日内瓦谈判的真相。
    谈到所谓“西藏问题”时，库兹涅佐夫说，有人企图强迫本届大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”这样一类问题，这一点证明某些集团在力图阻挠在联合国建立认真的气氛。那些暗中指挥爱尔兰和马来亚的人想用一切手段维持“冷战”气氛。这样做就粗暴地践踏了联合国的原则，从而严重地破坏了它的威信。联合国大会应该反击利用联合国来加剧国际关系的尝试。我们的职责是竭力促进国际局势正常化，维护和加强普遍和平。
    库兹涅佐夫接着说，目前，研究宇宙空间的问题引起越来越多的注意。现在，飞往其他天体的最大胆的理想正成为现实。苏联最近向宇宙发射的自动行星际站就是这样的步骤。库兹涅佐夫强调，在研究宇宙空间和利用宇宙空间为人类造福的问题上，必须尽可能广泛地保证各国平等合作。由于考虑到交流科学研究成就的经验有助于加快对于宇宙方面的研究，苏联政府打算提出一项建议：在联合国的主持下召开国际科学家代表会议，讨论在研究宇宙空间方面交流经验的问题。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说，最近出现了国际紧张局势缓和和国与国间的关系正常化的倾向，国家领导人越来越开始意识到执行和平共处政策和通过谈判解决国际争端的必要性。应该再一次指出苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问美国和美国总统艾森豪威尔即将访问苏联一事对确定和平共处政策原则的事业的卓越贡献。在赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔在戴维营会谈后发表的联合公报中，双方一致认为，一切尚未解决的国际问题的解决不应该动用武力，而应该用和平的方法，通过谈判来解决，这一点无疑地对国际关系今后的发展具有重大意义。所有国家、各国人民都应当为了达到一个伟大的目的——保证长期和牢固的和平，作出努力。
