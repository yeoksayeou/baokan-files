Why Doesn't Qiao Guizhai Keep His Accounts Anymore?
　　Shao Chuanlie

Around the National Day holiday, I read many good articles in newspapers and magazines. In one article, I read about a meaningful event:

In Jinsha City, Guizhou Province, there is an old man named Qiao Guizhai who is over eighty years old. He still keeps a very precious old ledger. This ledger does not record daily income and expenditure, nor does it record commodity transactions, but it records the accounts for a full thirty-eight years from 1912 to 1950, noting the price of grain and coal in each period.

According to the old man, in the old society, grain prices rose daily and nightly, and the poor were most afraid of grain price increases. Once grain took the lead, everything else followed. He specially recorded it to see when it would finally stop rising.

This account is well kept! This ledger is a living textbook and a vivid historical record. I think it is worth preserving. At least it can let future generations know how the older generation lived and in what environment they lived.

I haven't seen the old man's ledger, and I don't know the specific numbers. However, I have a record of grain and coal price increases in Shanghai from 1937 to 1949:

From 1937 to May 1949, prices in Shanghai rose by 360 trillion times. The money that could buy 5.5 million dan of rice in 1937 could only buy one grain of rice in 1949. The money that could buy 40 billion dan of coal briquettes in 1937 could only buy one coal briquette in 1949.

Everyone, look, what astonishing numbers, what terrible ratios!

Everyone who lived in the old society understands the full meaning of the above figures. We probably all have a ledger like Old Man Qiao's in our hearts. At that time, didn't we often have to carry a sack of "gold yuan notes" to buy a few dou of rice? Didn't we rush to queue up to exchange "big heads" and "small heads" after receiving our wages? Wasn't it true that the money that could buy three dou of rice in the morning couldn't even buy one dou of rice by noon? This kind of terrible life is probably unforgettable for anyone who has experienced it.

A kite with a broken string soars upwards with a burst of energy, but it will eventually burst when it reaches a certain height. The day that Old Man Qiao Guizhai hoped for, "when will the price increases finally stop," finally arrived! The kite exploded, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary dynasty collapsed and fell. The People's Republic of China was founded, the Renminbi was issued, and the two wings on the bodies of grain and coal briquettes were completely broken. Prices stabilized day by day, so Qiao Guizhai stopped keeping his accounts in 1950. It's not that he was lazy or lacked perseverance, but rather: "From then on, grain prices were the same every day, and there was no need to record them. If I had to record them, I might as well make a 'same as above' stamp and stamp it every day!"

This is absolutely true. From this point of view, it is reasonable for the old man to stop keeping accounts.

However, that's not entirely the case.

We don't record the "increase" in prices, but after liberation, there was an "decrease" in prices that is worth recording.

We might as well take a new ledger and add a few notes for the old man:

From March 1, 1950, to 1959, the price of medium-grade white japonica rice in Shanghai decreased from 19.68 yuan per dan to 15.15 yuan, a decrease of 23%; the price of coal briquettes decreased from 3.75 yuan per dan in 1950 to 2.8 yuan, a decrease of 25.3%...

Of course, there are many things to record, far more than these two items. However, a drop of water can reflect the sun, and a grain of rice can reveal the whole world. These two figures are enough to illustrate everything that needs to be illustrated, saving a lot of pen and ink.

Open Qiao Guizhai's ledger, and on those yellowed pages, it records the turbulence, misfortune, and suffering of the people's lives at that time... And when we open another "ledger"—no, not a ledger, but the newest and most beautiful picture album—on each page, it depicts the peace, happiness, and joy of the people's lives... Comparing the before and after, the changes over ten years are clear.

However, at this very moment, some people are shouting loudly "the present is not as good as the past," saying that "the market is completely strained," "in the past, you could buy anything, but now you can't buy anything." Among these people, except for a small number who are confused, the rest are either those who used to fatten themselves by drinking the blood and sweat of the working people or those who shared their leftovers. From Old Man Qiao's ledger, can't we see this clearly enough?

### 谯贵斋的账为什么不记了？

　　谯贵斋的账为什么不记了？
　　邵传烈
    国庆节前后，从报纸刊物中读了很多好文章，在一篇文章中，我读到这样一件有意义的事情：
    贵州省金沙城有位八十多岁的老大爷，名叫谯贵斋。他至今还保存着一册很珍贵的老账簿。这本账簿不是记着日常收支，也不是记着商品交易，而是记着从1912年到1950年整整三十八年的账目，记着每一时期的粮价、煤价。
    据这位老大爷说，在旧社会里粮价日跳夜升，穷人最怕粮价涨，粮食一领头，什么东西都跟着上去，他特地把它记下来，看看究竟涨到什么时候，才算到了头。
    这笔账记得好！这本账簿，是一本活的教科书，也是一份生动的历史资料。我看很有保留下来的价值。至少可以使后辈知道：老一辈人的日子，是怎样过的，是在什么环境下过过来的。
    老大爷这本账簿，我没见过；具体数字，也不清楚。不过手头有一份1937年——1949年上海的粮、煤上涨记录：
    从1937年到1949年5月，上海的物价，上涨了三十六万亿倍，在1937年可以买五百五十万担大米的钱，到1949年只能买一粒米；在1937年能买四百亿担煤球的钱，到1949年只能买一只煤球。
    大家看，这是多么惊人的数字，多么可怕的比数！
    每一个在旧社会生活过的人，都懂得上面几个数字的全部意义，我们心里大概都有一本谯老大爷的账簿。在那时，我们不是时常要背一麻袋“金圆券”去买几斗米吗？一发了工资，不是要急忙去排队兑换“大头”“小头”吗？早上可以买三斗米的钱，到了中午一斗米也买不到了吗？这种可怕的生活，只要经历过的人，恐怕是终生难忘的。
    断了线的气球，一股劲儿地往上窜，但升到一定高度，总要破裂的。老大爷谯贵斋所盼望的“究竟涨到什么时候才算到了头”的一天，终于来到了！气球炸了，蒋介石反动王朝崩溃倒塌了；中华人民共和国成立了，人民币发行了，粮食、煤球身上两只翅膀，彻底打掉了。物价，一天天平稳下来，因此，谯贵斋的账，记到1950年就不再记了。并不是他偷懒，没有恒心，而是：“从那以后，粮价天天一样，没有记的必要了，如果要记，倒不如刻个‘同上’的图章，天天往上盖就得了！”
    这话真是千真万确。从这方面来说，老大爷不再记账是有道理的。
    不过，又不尽然。
    不记“涨”字的账；然而解放后，又出了一笔“降”字的账，却是值得一记的。
    我们不妨拿过一本新账簿，来替老大爷补记几笔：
    从1950年3月1日到1959年，上海的中白粳每担从十九点六八元下降到十五点一五元、下降了23％；煤球，每担从1950年的三点七五元下降到二点八元，下降了25.3％……
    当然，要记的东西很多，远不止这两笔。可是，一滴水可以反映太阳，一粒粆里可以看见整个世界。这两个数字，足够说明应该说明的一切，省去了不少的笔墨与口舌。
    翻开谯贵斋的账簿，在那发黄的纸上，记下了多少当时人民生活的动荡、不幸、痛苦……而我们打开另一本“账簿”——不，不是一本账簿，是一本最新最美的画册，在每一页上，却又画上多少人民生活的安宁、欢乐、喜悦……前后对比，十年的变化，一清二楚。
    可是，也正在此时，却有人在大叫大嚷“今不如昔”，说什么“市场全面紧张”、“过去什么都买得到，现在什么也买不到”，这其中除了一小部分人是糊涂虫以外，剩下的不是过去喝劳动人民血汗以自肥的人，就是分享他们残羹剩饭的人。这个事实，从谯老大爷的账簿里，难道还不能看得清清楚楚吗？
