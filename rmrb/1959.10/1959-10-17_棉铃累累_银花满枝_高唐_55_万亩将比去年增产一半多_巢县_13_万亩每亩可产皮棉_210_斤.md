Title: Heavy Cotton Boll Harvest, Silvery Flowers Fill Branches: Gaotang's 550,000 Mu Expected to Increase Production by More Than Half Compared to Last Year, Chaoxian's 130,000 Mu Can Produce 210 Jin of Ginned Cotton Per Mu

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th: Gaotang County, Shandong Province, a major cotton-producing area, has seen unprecedented growth of its 550,000 mu of cotton this year. Judging from the cotton already harvested and the cotton bolls about to open, Gaotang County has a great hope of becoming a "hundred-jin ginned cotton county," with production increasing by more than 50% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958.

As of October 9th, Gaotang County had picked 66 million jin of seed cotton, averaging 120 jin per mu, nearly double the amount in the same period last year. Currently, the county is in a season of abundant harvests, with cotton bolls everywhere and silvery flowers filling the branches. Thousands upon thousands of cotton pickers are engaged in a cotton-picking competition with the goals of fast picking, careful picking, high quality, and large quantities. Vehicles loaded with new cotton from the various People's Communes are continuously streaming toward the cotton processing plants.

The unprecedented cotton harvest in Gaotang County vividly demonstrates the superiority of the People's Communes. The large scope of the communes, the contiguous land, and the abundant manpower and resources provide extremely favorable conditions for overcoming natural disasters and improving farming techniques. During the peak period of flowering and boll formation, the area encountered severe drought and insect pests. The communes across the county mobilized thousands of people, cooperating and supporting each other in a sustained drought resistance struggle lasting a month. Communes and teams dug water sources and built canals. The county built more than 1,300 canals of various types, totaling over 8,500 kilometers in length, diverting water from the Yellow River, allowing the vast majority of cotton fields to be irrigated two or three times. At the same time, the successively occurring insect pests were also eliminated in a timely manner through intensive control measures. This year, the cotton sowing and seedling protection work was also done well.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: Chaoxian County, Anhui, has achieved an unprecedented bumper cotton harvest in a year of severe drought. The county's more than 130,000 mu of cotton can produce more than 270,000 dan of ginned cotton, averaging 210 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 27.3% compared to last year. Currently, the mid-season bolls, accounting for more than 70% of the cotton production, have been picked and stored, and commune members are strengthening late-stage management of the cotton fields to harvest more late-season bolls.

Chaoxian County is a new cotton-growing area. This year, the Chaoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the superior conditions of the People's Commune's large scale, which allows for better rational layout of cotton and grain fields, and under the condition of balancing the income of the region and the commune members, freed up 110,000 mu of 'bangtian' fields with a certain amount of water sources to grow cotton. In this way, during the more than two months of severe drought, the general cotton fields were irrigated two to five times, so the cotton basically did not suffer losses due to drought. At the same time, labor was rationally and uniformly used, and sowing was done more than half a month earlier than in previous years. Because of the early sowing, the peak flowering and budding period of cotton had passed by the period of more than twenty consecutive days of high temperatures at the end of July and the beginning of August this year, so the cotton growth was not damaged. In terms of preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests, the county carefully selected cotton seeds when harvesting flowers last autumn, and also treated them with medicine before sowing, eliminating underground insect pests in the cotton fields. The People's Communes also set up many indigenous pesticide factories, manufacturing a large number of indigenous pesticides. When the cotton cutworm pest first appeared, the People's Communes vigorously controlled it, eliminating the pests entirely in their early stages. In addition, the county has established cotton technical research organizations at all levels, which has also played a significant role in ensuring this year's bumper cotton harvest.

　　棉铃累累　银花满枝
    高唐55万亩将比去年增产一半多
    巢县13万亩每亩可产皮棉210斤
    据新华社济南16日电　盛产棉花的山东省高唐县，今年五十五万亩棉花生长空前良好。据已经收获的棉花和即将开放的棉桃情况来看，高唐县实现百斤皮棉县大有希望，产量将比大丰收的1958年增长50％以上。
    到10月9日止，高唐县已拾籽棉六千六百万斤，每亩平均一百二十斤，比去年同期增加近一倍。目前，全县正处在棉铃累累，银花满枝的丰收季节。千千万万的拾棉人，投入了快拾、细摘、质高、量大的收棉竞赛。各个人民公社满载新棉的车辆，络绎不绝地涌向棉花加工厂。
    高唐县棉花空前丰收，生动地证明了人民公社的优越性。公社的范围大，土地连成片，人力、物力充沛，给战胜自然灾害和改进耕作技术带来了十分有利的条件。正当开花结铃盛期，这里遇到严重的干旱和虫害，全县各公社就调动千军万马，相互协作支援，持续抗旱斗争达一月之久。社社队队挖水源、修渠道，全县共修筑各种渠道一千三百多条，长达八千五百多公里，引来了黄河水，使绝大部分棉田浇了两三遍水。在此同时，先后发生的虫害，也经突击除治，及时消灭。今年棉花播种和保苗工作也都做得好。
    据新华社合肥16日电　安徽巢县棉花在大旱之年获得了空前大丰收。全县十三万多亩棉花，可产皮棉二十七万多担，平均每亩可产皮棉二百一十斤，比去年增产27.3％。现在，占棉花产量70％以上的伏桃已经采摘入仓，社员们正在为多收秋桃而加强棉田后期管理。
    巢县是个新棉区，今年，中共巢县县委根据人民公社规模大，可以更好地进行棉田和粮田的合理布局的优越条件，在照顾地区和社员收入平衡的条件下，腾出了十一万亩有一定水源的塝田种植棉花。这样，在大旱两个多月的情况下，一般棉田都浇灌了两次到五次水，使棉花基本上没有因旱而受损失。同时，合理地统一使用了劳动力，播种季节比往年提前半个多月。由于种得早，到今年7月底8月初连续二十多天的高温时期，棉花的开花现蕾盛期已过，因而棉花生长未受损害。在防治棉花病虫害方面，全县在去年秋天收花时就精选了棉种，下种前又经过了药剂处理，在棉花地消灭了地下虫害。人民公社还办了很多土农药厂，制造了大量土农药，当棉花的斜纹夜盗蛾虫害刚一露头时，各人民公社就大力防治，把虫害全部消灭在初生阶段。此外，全县都逐级建立了棉花技术研究组织，对保证今年棉花丰产也起了很大作用。
