Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 29th: Tens of thousands of rolling mill workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Ansteel) reported a resounding success to the National Congress of Heroes: They exceeded the October steel production plan three days ahead of schedule. As of the 28th, the steel production from Ansteel's thirteen rolling mills was more than 16,000 tons higher than September, which was the highest output since the beginning of this year.

Entering October, the workers of Ansteel's thirteen rolling mills launched a pledge competition, determined to create outstanding achievements to dedicate to the National Congress of Heroes. They widely carried out technical performance competitions, promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy wave upon wave. The first joint technical performance competition week, from October 15th to 21st, led to a sharp 26.3% increase in the daily steel production level compared to the first fourteen days of the month; the daily steel production level in the first four days (October 25th to 28th) of the second joint technical performance competition week continued to rise by 2%. The workers of Ansteel's No. 1 Blooming Mill, an advanced unit attending the National Congress of Heroes, launched a technical performance competition. In the recent fourteen days, they performed nearly ten operational techniques per person on average, creating a total of 427 advanced experiences. Fu Rudong, the head of the continuous rolling section, addressed the issue of increasingly large steel billet sizes by demonstrating his many years of practical operational experience, helping workers throughout the section improve their technical level, which improved the billet qualification rate by 1.95% compared to the plan; the daily output also increased rapidly, creating favorable conditions for fraternal rolling mills to complete their plans ahead of schedule.

The entire workforce on Ansteel's rolling mill front is determined to increase the country's production of high-quality steel by 40,000 tons in October as a tribute to the National Congress of Heroes.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 29th: The advanced collective attending the National Congress of Heroes, the national large-scale Red Flag Open Hearth Furnace, Ansteel's No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace, exceeded its October production plan ahead of schedule on the morning of the 29th.

Ansteel's No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace, known for "more loading, faster smelting, high temperature, and long life," had already been used 397 times by the end of September, exceeding the national plan by 29 times, entering its "old age." According to the plan, it should have been overhauled long ago. However, the workers were determined to smelt more steel with it. They used their long-accumulated furnace protection experience to maintain its furnace body very well, postponing the overhaul date to October 19th. The furnace body reached a service life of 429 times, setting the highest record for furnace roof life among national large-scale open hearth furnaces this year.

This month, the workers fighting on this open hearth furnace improved their smelting techniques through technical performance competitions, which rapidly shortened smelting time and significantly increased the loading amount. From October 1st to the morning of the 29th, they smelted 64 furnaces of steel in the time planned for 62 furnaces, with the average steel production per furnace increasing by 11.9 tons compared to September; the smelting time per furnace was shortened by 19 minutes compared to the national plan.

    鞍钢轧钢健儿捷音先传
    六号红旗平炉老当益壮昨天实现十月指标
    新华社鞍山29日电　鞍钢几万名轧钢职工向全国群英会报捷：提前三天超额完成10月份钢材生产计划。到28日止，鞍钢十三个轧钢厂生产的钢材，比今年以来产量最高的9月份还多一万六千多吨。
    一进入10月，鞍钢十三个轧钢厂的职工就誓师比武，决心创造优异成绩向全国群英会献礼。他们广泛开展技术表演赛，推动增产节约运动一浪高过一浪地前进。从10月15日到21日开展的第一次联合技术表演竞赛周，使钢材的日产水平比头十四天猛涨26.3％；第二次联合技术表演竞赛周的头四天（25日到28日）的钢材日产水平，又继续上涨2％。出席全国群英会的先进单位、鞍钢第一初轧厂的职工，展开技术表演竞赛，在最近十四天里，平均每人表演近十次操作技术，共创造了四百二十七项先进经验。连轧工段段长傅汝栋，针对轧出来的钢坯尺寸越来越大的问题，表演他多年的实际操作经验，帮助全段工人提高技术水平，使钢坯的合格率比计划提高了1.95％；日产量也迅速提高，为兄弟轧钢厂提前完成计划创造了有利条件。
    鞍钢轧钢战线上的全体职工，决心在10月份给国家增产四万吨优质钢材，向全国群英会献礼。
    新华社鞍山29日电　出席全国群英会的先进集体、全国大型红旗平炉鞍钢六号平炉，在29日上午提前超额完成了10月份的生产计划。
    以“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”著称的鞍钢六号平炉，到9月末炉顶已经使用三百九十七次，超过国家计划二十九次，进入“老年期”，按计划早就应该检修了。但是职工们决心叫它多炼钢。他们运用长期积累的护炉经验，把它的炉体维护得很好，使检修日期推迟到10月19日，炉体使用寿命达到四百二十九次，创造全国大型平炉今年以来炉顶寿命最高纪录。
    这个月，战斗在这座平炉上的工人们，通过技术表演竞赛，提高了冶炼技术，使冶炼时间迅速缩短，装入量显著增加。10月份到29日上午为止，用计划炼六十二炉钢的时间，冶炼了六十四炉钢，平均每炉产钢量比9月份每炉增加十一点九吨；每炉钢的冶炼时间，比国家计划缩短十九分钟。（附图片）
