Great Leap Forward in Water Conservancy and Power Construction
Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power Fu Zuoyi

　　Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and electricity is the vanguard of industry. However, before liberation, water conservancy and power construction in our country were very backward.

　　Our country is very rich in water resources. The average annual total flow of rivers across the country is about 2.68 trillion cubic meters. As long as half of this flow is used for irrigation, each mu of the country's existing cultivated land can receive 800 cubic meters of irrigation water to ensure high and stable yields of crops. However, in old China, water and drought disasters were very serious. According to incomplete statistics from the Yellow River Basin alone, there were more than 1,500 floods and 1,073 droughts in the past 3,000 years. Each major disaster resulted in hundreds of thousands or millions of people suffering from famine and death.

　　Although China's electric power industry had a history of 67 years before liberation, its scale was small, its development was slow, and it was an economic appendage of imperialism from the very beginning. The distribution of power stations was extremely unreasonable, with more than 90% of the equipment concentrated in the Northeast and a few large coastal cities directly controlled by imperialist countries. Not only was the equipment outdated and the models varied, but often within the same city, electricity could not be supplied by a central power station or a unified power grid. Instead, each imperialist country had its own controlled power supply area, supplying electricity of different specifications separately. This phenomenon of regional division and independent administration in the power industry fully reflected the characteristics of a semi-colonial society and created many obstacles to restoration and transformation after liberation.

　　In the ten years from the founding of the People's Republic of China to this year, China's economic construction has achieved unprecedented and tremendous development. Especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward this year, China's water conservancy and power construction have fundamentally changed the backward situation before liberation.

　　Water Conservancy Construction Has Initially Changed the Landscape

　　Before liberation, no river in our country had undergone systematic management and development throughout its entire basin. In the past ten years, we have begun to manage and develop our country's major rivers, such as the Huai River, Yellow River, Hai River, Pearl River, Liao River, Yangtze River, and Songhua River, to varying degrees. Some have been basically controlled, some are about to be basically controlled, and some have also undergone important flood control projects. At the same time, under the guidance of the "three main" policy of focusing on small-scale projects, focusing on community management, and focusing on water storage, new experiences have been created for soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, water conservancy in mountainous areas, irrigation, and the management of low-lying and waterlogged areas, and have been widely promoted. These achievements have brought about important changes in the landscape of our country.

　　The comprehensive management of the Huai River began in 1951. In the past eight years, we have built nine large reservoirs and more than a dozen lake and depression storage projects in its upper and middle reaches, and two more reservoirs are under construction. In the lower reaches, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and the Fenhuai into Yi River, two huge canals that can divert floods and irrigate, have been completed and are under construction. At the same time, the dikes of the main and tributary rivers in the upper, middle, and lower reaches have been renovated and reinforced. The Linhuaigang Reservoir currently under construction in Anhui will directly control the main stream of the Huai River, creating a new cascade above Hongze Lake, increasing the flood control capacity of the middle reaches of the Huai River to the level of defending against floods that occur once every hundred years, and can also greatly develop irrigation. The Yin Huai Ru Yi project under construction in Jiangsu will divert the Huai River northward to divert part of the flood and irrigate the vast areas north of the abandoned Yellow River in Jiangsu. In coordination with other projects, the flood control capacity of the lower reaches of the Huai River will be improved to the point where it can defend against floods that occur once every three hundred years. Since 1958, the management of the drought-prone and waterlogged areas of northern Anhui has involved the large-scale construction of river network projects, which can not only reduce drought and flood disasters but also convert some of the land to rice paddies.

　　In 1931, a huge flood occurred in the Huai River, inundating more than 70 million mu of land. According to records, the total amount of water flowing through the Hongze Lake mouth during the flood season of eighty days was 36.4 billion cubic meters. The projects we have completed and are constructing now have a total designed capacity of 29.58 billion cubic meters, of which the flood control capacity is 22.868 billion cubic meters. In addition to the role of a large number of small-scale projects and drainage projects, flood disasters like those of 1931 will never happen again. Of this 29.58 billion cubic meters of water storage capacity, approximately 8.433 billion cubic meters can be used for beneficial purposes. This creates extremely favorable conditions for large-scale development of irrigation and hydropower generation, as well as regulating the perennial water volume of navigation channels in the middle and lower reaches.

　　The Yellow River is a world-renowned river with the highest sediment content and a tendency to silt up, shift course, and breach its banks. In the past three thousand years, it has suffered an average of one breach and flood disaster every two years. When the flow at Shanzhou exceeds 10,000 cubic meters per second, there is a 90% chance of a breach in the lower reaches. Since the liberation of the lower Yellow River region in 1946, the 1,800 kilometers of dikes and embankment projects along both banks of the lower Yellow River have been renovated and rebuilt. In fourteen years, we have defended against seventeen floods with a flow rate of more than 10,000 cubic meters per second, without any breaches or disasters. The 1958 flood, with a flow rate of 22,300 cubic meters per second at Huayuankou, was similar to the 1933 flood that caused a major disaster, but was also safely discharged.

　　In 1955, the National People's Congress approved the Yellow River Basin Plan, and the management of the Yellow River entered a new stage. The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project, which controls 92% of the Yellow River's total basin area, stores 35.4 billion cubic meters of water, and accounts for 75% of the river's multi-year average total water volume, will be able to control floods next year and strive to start generating electricity. This is a key project for controlling the Yellow River and promoting benefits and eliminating harm. From next year onwards, the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River will be basically eliminated. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many cascade projects on the main stream, focusing on power generation and irrigation, such as the Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia in Gansu, the Qingtongxia in Ningxia, the Sanshenggong in Inner Mongolia, and the Weishan water conservancy hub project in Shandong, have all started construction. In order to reduce the sediment content of the Yellow River, extend the service life of these hub projects, and develop production in the vast mountainous and plateau areas, 150,000 square kilometers of the 430,000 square kilometers of the Loess Plateau region, where soil erosion is most serious, have begun soil and water conservation work, which will gradually play a role in water storage and soil conservation. Six large irrigation areas have been built in the downstream area, and a large number of siphon projects have been carried out. The mass water conservancy movement will greatly shorten the scheduled period for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. In just ten years, we have tamed the Yellow River, which has been uncontrollable, rampaging, and harmful to the people for thousands of years, making it obedient to the people's command, and we will also receive huge irrigation and power generation benefits.

　　The Hai River Basin is a region with fundamentally insufficient water volume, but because the annual rainfall is concentrated, serious floods and waterlogging disasters often occur. Our goal is to combine large, medium, and small projects to fully control the Hai River's water volume, eliminate flood and waterlogging disasters, vigorously develop groundwater, and use Yellow River water to greatly develop irrigation, hydropower, and shipping. At present, we have built and are building seven large reservoirs and two flood diversion rivers on the main rivers in the Hai River Basin, including the Miyun Reservoir, which has a total capacity of 4.1 billion cubic meters. At the same time, the Xihe sluice water storage project has been built at the confluence of the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Nanyun River, and the tidal barrier sluice project for salt resistance and freshwater storage has been built on the main stream of the Hai River.

　　To completely eliminate drought and ensure high and stable yields of crops, the total irrigation water demand in the Hai River Basin is approximately 43 billion cubic meters, while the multi-year average total water volume of the Hai River is 14.5 billion cubic meters. The total storage capacity of the large reservoirs we have completed and are constructing is approximately 9.9 billion cubic meters, and the water storage capacity of Baiyangdian and Dongdian is approximately 3 billion cubic meters, which has controlled most of the Hai River's water volume. The use of groundwater for irrigation in the Hai River Basin has also made great progress in recent years, and mechanical water lifting irrigation has been widely promoted. The People's Victory Canal and Weishan Water Diversion Sluice on the north bank of the Yellow River can divert Yellow River water directly to Tianjin through the Wei River and Nanyun River. These projects will gradually play a significant role in changing the arid face of the Hai River Basin. Due to the large number of water storage projects, flood and waterlogging disasters in the Hai River Basin will also be gradually controlled.

　　The Yangtze River is the largest river in our country, with a total discharge of approximately 1 trillion cubic meters into the sea, a hydropower potential of 230 million kilowatts, and 10,000-ton ships can navigate 1,100 kilometers. The management and development of such an influential river requires extensive preparatory work and therefore takes a long time. In order to prevent it from suffering serious floods and to buy time for fundamental management and development, we first renovated the dikes along the main and tributary rivers, and built the large-scale Jingjiang Flood Diversion and other water storage and reclamation projects in the middle reaches, where flood disasters are relatively severe. Preliminary efforts have also been made to manage Dongting Lake. At the same time, we have conducted large-scale surveys and research on the development of water resources in the entire Yangtze River Basin, and have compiled an outline of the comprehensive development plan for the basin. In 1958 and 1959, some local projects on tributaries, such as the Jiangxi Ganfu Plain Irrigation Project, the Sichuan Zipingpu, the Hunan Zhexi, and the Jiangxi Zhelang large-scale hydropower stations, have all started construction. On its largest tributary, the Han River, in addition to the Han River downstream flood diversion project that has already been built, construction of the controlling Danjiangkou Reservoir project began in 1958. This reservoir is designed to store 28.3 billion cubic meters of water. After completion, it can basically eliminate the severe flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Han River, and can also provide irrigation for 12 million mu and 900,000 kilowatts of hydropower generation, creating favorable conditions for diverting water from the Yangtze River Basin to the Yellow River, Huai River, and North China in the future. As for the great Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub, which controls the total water volume of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, active survey and design research work is underway. The magnificent vision of "high gorges creating flat lakes" will become a reality in the near future.

　　The Pearl River has an average annual water volume of 370 billion cubic meters, making it the second largest river in our country after the Yangtze River. While we are carrying out preparatory work for fundamental management and development, we have begun to construct some projects based on the urgent needs of industrial and agricultural production, such as the Liuxihe Hydropower Station and the Beijiang Flood Control Project. At the same time, we have renovated and rebuilt the complex dike projects in the delta area, and built some irrigation and drainage sluice gate projects. In 1959, construction of the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station began on the Dong River, with a storage capacity of 11.5 billion cubic meters, which will be able to control floods and generate electricity next year.

　　For the Liao River in the Northeast, we have completed the Dahuo house Reservoir on the Hun River tributary and are now building the Xinlitu Reservoir on the Qing River tributary. For the Songhua River, we have renovated the Fengman Reservoir.

　　The management of small and medium-sized rivers in various places has developed rapidly under the leadership of local party and government leaders, and some have undergone comprehensive management and development, becoming models for river management work across the country.

　　In coordination with river management work, in terms of farmland water conservancy, through the two water conservancy upsurges in 1952 and 1956 and the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a total of more than 4 million small and medium-sized reservoirs and canals, more than 15 million ponds and dams, more than 11 million wells, and more than 2.9 million horsepower of drainage and irrigation power machinery have been built. The national irrigated area has increased from 240 million mu in 1949 to approximately 1 billion mu now, equivalent to more than three times the total irrigated area accumulated over thousands of years. The proportion of irrigated area to cultivated land has increased from 16.3% in 1949 to more than 60% now. Although some irrigation areas still need to level the land, build field projects, or equip water lifting tools to fully realize their benefits, they have already demonstrated a significant role in overcoming this year's severe drought.

　　Generating Equipment Increased 3.6 Times, Power Generation Increased 8 Times

　　During the period of national economic recovery, the development of China's electric power industry, in accordance with the Party's policy of restoring and developing production, tapping potential, and practicing strict economy, mainly focused on carrying out huge restoration and transformation work on the original electric power industry. In accordance with the management principles of socialist enterprises, democratic reforms were implemented, technical management was strengthened, and restorative repairs were carried out on the original equipment, so that China's power production, without basically increasing equipment, exceeded the highest historical level of power generation by 22% by 1952. After the production reforms and large-scale construction during the First Five-Year Plan period, by the end of 1957, the national power generation had reached 19.3 billion kilowatt-hours, and the generating equipment capacity had increased to 4.635 million kilowatts. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual growth rate of power generation was 21.6%. Such a rapid rate of development is beyond the reach of any capitalist country.

　　During the First Five-Year Plan period, in order to adapt to the needs of industrial development, especially the construction of new industrial areas, in addition to actively expanding the original power stations, power stations were also built on a large scale in emerging industrial areas; at the same time, hydropower resources were vigorously surveyed, the country's major rivers were surveyed, and a number of excellent hydropower generation sites were selected, creating conditions for large-scale hydropower construction in the future. Within five years, seventy-six thermal and hydropower power stations were newly built and expanded, increasing the generating equipment capacity by 2.47 million kilowatts (1.84 million kilowatts for thermal power and 630,000 kilowatts for hydropower), exceeding the original plan by 20%. In the construction of power stations, modern new technologies were adopted, the degree of mechanization and automation was increased, and a number of thermal power stations were built in accordance with the policy of centralized supply of industrial heat. With the increase in power stations and the expansion of power supply areas, transmission lines and substations have also grown significantly. During the First Five-Year Plan period, transmission lines increased by 4,781 kilometers, and substation equipment increased by 4.06 million kilovolt-amperes, an increase of 40% and 113% respectively compared with 1949. The construction of new power stations and the formation of power grids not only ensured the electricity consumption for industrial construction, but also greatly changed the extremely unreasonable regional distribution of China's electric power industry. For example, in the Northwest region, where the electric power industry foundation was weak, by the end of 1957, generating equipment had increased by 16.8 times compared with the past, and the Southwest region had also increased by 2.7 times compared with the past. In ethnic minority areas, under the close care of the Party and the government, a number of thermal and hydropower power stations were built from scratch in new industrial areas in order to meet the needs of economic construction, and modern power bases began to take shape.

　　1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in our country. With the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the electric power industry also achieved an unprecedented leap forward. Last year, the national power generation reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 42.5% compared with 1957; the newly added generating equipment capacity reached 1.797 million kilowatts (excluding small power stations run by urban and rural masses), which was 2.4 times the newly added generating equipment capacity in 1957, approximately equal to three-quarters of the total newly added equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. During the Great Leap Forward, new achievements were made in both production and capital construction. In terms of production, through many important technical reforms, the overhaul period of major production equipment was shortened by half, and the interval between regular overhauls was also doubled; the output of most equipment was increased; and measures were taken to increase the power supply capacity by raising the voltage on some high-voltage transmission lines and widely promote live-line maintenance methods. This has led to an unprecedented increase in equipment utilization and further unleashed production potential. The annual utilization hours of generating equipment reached 5,518 hours, an increase of 15% compared with 1957, equivalent to 2.3 times that of 1949. The main economic indicators have also been significantly improved. For example, the average national consumption of standard coal per kilowatt-hour generated reached 0.559 kg, a decrease of 7.5% compared with 1957 and a decrease of 45% compared with 1949; the average annual coal consumption rate of some advanced power plants reached 0.351 kg; the average national line loss rate reached 7.57%, also a decrease of 19% compared with 1957 and a decrease of more than two-thirds compared with 1949. Due to the reduction in consumption indicators and the improvement of business management, the unit cost of electricity sales decreased by 3.2% compared with 1957. In terms of capital construction, mass movements with high speed, high quality, low cost, and safety were carried out, some excessively high construction standards were reasonably lowered, and many effective technical measures were promoted, improving engineering design and improving construction management, so that the construction cost of power stations was about half lower than that during the First Five-Year Plan period, and the construction period was generally shortened by about half. For example, the time from groundbreaking to power generation for a high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power station was shortened from 25 months in the past to 13 months; the construction period of large-scale hydropower projects, such as the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station (final capacity of 1.1 million kilowatts), will be advanced from 1962 to 1960 for flood control and strive to generate electricity; and the construction period of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station has been shortened by more than one year compared with the plan. Such a fast speed was difficult to imagine before the Great Leap Forward.

　　In 1958, while building large and medium-sized power stations, a mass power generation movement was also carried out on a large scale in rural areas and some small and medium-sized cities. Small hydropower stations built in rural areas alone reached 150,000 kilowatts, more than five times the past. The development of the mass power generation movement is a huge popularization movement of the electric power industry, giving the electric power industry a broad mass base.

　　In 1959, China's national economy is continuing to leap forward. Industrial production in the first half of the year increased by 65% compared with the same period last year, and the national power generation in the first half of the year also increased by 55% compared with the same period last year. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the great call to the people of the whole country to complete the main indicators of the last year (1962) of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year, a vigorous and magnificent production upsurge has formed throughout the country. In order to ensure the electricity needs of the rapidly growing national economy, the electric power industry will exceed the target of generating 39 billion kilowatt-hours this year. This plan is an increase of 42% compared with the power generation in 1958. After completing or exceeding this plan, the power production this year will approach or even reach the original level of 40 billion to 43 billion kilowatt-hours planned for the Second Five-Year Plan. Judging from the current trend of rapid growth in electricity consumption in national economic construction, it is entirely possible to reach or exceed the level of 40 billion kilowatt-hours, which is an even greater leap forward. The installed capacity plan for capital construction this year is expected to reach 2.3 million kilowatts by the end of the year, equivalent to more than 90% of the newly added generating equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period, and 128% of the newly added generating equipment capacity during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In order to complete this year's production and construction plan, all employees of the electric power industry are fighting with high morale and enthusiasm in the increased production and thrift movement, extensively carrying out socialist competition, and fighting with full confidence to complete this year's plan tasks of the electric power industry.

　　After the construction plan this year is completed, generating equipment will increase by 3.6 times compared with 1949, and power generation will increase by more than eight times. Twenty-five 110,000-volt or higher power systems will be formed throughout the country, including more than 80% of the country's generating equipment. The number of power systems with 100,000 kilowatts or more will increase from three in the recovery period to eighteen, and the largest power system will reach 2.7 million kilowatts; the proportion of high-temperature and high-pressure generating equipment capacity will also increase from 1% in 1949 to 27%; large steam turbine generator units with a single unit capacity of 25,000 to 100,000 kilowatts will account for 40% of the total thermal power equipment; and the proportion of hydropower equipment capacity will also increase from 8.8% in 1949 to 18%. The production technology level of China's electric power industry will be further improved.

　　The Great Development of Water Conservancy and Electric Power is a Great Victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes

　　The great victory of China's water conservancy and electric power construction in the past ten years is a victory led by the great Communist Party of China; it is a victory achieved under the brilliant illumination of the general line, under the guidance of a complete set of policies of walking on two legs and the "three main" policy of water conservancy construction, and vigorously carrying out mass movements; it is a victory for China's socialist construction and the socialist transformation of agriculture, especially the people's commune movement.

　　Our country has a vast territory and a large population, but its economy is poor and blank. It is the ardent desire of hundreds of millions of people to change this backward situation at the fastest speed. This situation is particularly evident in water conservancy. Because natural rainfall is changeable, truly the weather is unpredictable, and many water conservancy projects, as long as they are built quickly, built in large numbers, and play their benefits one day earlier, it is possible to prevent huge flood disasters, save irreplaceable loss of life, and protect the safety of large-scale agricultural production and important cities, industrial and mining areas, and transportation. The leadership of the Party concentratedly reflects this ardent desire of the broad masses of the people. The socialist transformation of agriculture led by the Party has liberated the hands and feet of 500 million peasants who have been bound for thousands of years; the Party's working method of the mass line has awakened 600 million people to change their own destiny with their own strength. Millions of Party members have played a vanguard and backbone role in every corner of the country and on the front lines of water conservancy construction. The general line put forward by the Party is even more a mobilization horn and a battle flag. Therefore, China's water conservancy construction has been developing at the fastest speed and on the largest scale in the ten years since the founding of the country. Since 1958, it has shown a heroic spirit that overwhelms mountains and seas, with a Great Leap Forward that exceeds thousands of years in one year, becoming the forerunner of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country.

　　The achievements of China's water conservancy construction in the past ten years, especially the effectiveness of these water conservancy projects in this year's severe water and drought disasters, clearly demonstrate the brilliant victory of the general line and the brilliant victory of the Great Leap Forward. In the past ten years, the Chinese people have completed 80 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work in water conservancy construction, which can be laid out in a row around the Earth's equator 1,971 times, of which 58 billion cubic meters were completed in 1958 alone. This year, seventeen provinces and regions in our country suffered severe drought during the Sanfu period when crops need the most water, and the total area affected by drought was approximately 320 million mu. The severity of the drought was similar to the six major droughts from 1928 to 1944. In 1928 and 1944, many places were barren for miles, and starving people were everywhere; but this year, more than 200 million mu of farmland have been freed from the threat of drought. The reservoirs and Hongze Lake water storage in the Huai River Basin alone irrigated 14 million mu of farmland, and the river network project and small and medium-sized reservoirs and ponds in northern Anhui ensured the bumper harvest of 27 million mu of farmland. Shandong and Henan provinces diverted water from the Yellow River to irrigate 14.89 million mu of farmland, and the 80 million mu affected by drought in Henan received irrigation to varying degrees. This year, the Hai River Basin in North China had many concentrated rainstorms, and the rainfall was equivalent to that of 1949. In the center of the rainstorm area, it was even greater than in 1949 and before liberation in 1917 and 1939. In 1949, the disaster area in Hebei Province reached more than 40 million mu. In 1917 and 1939, floods invaded Tianjin City, and some streets were two meters deep in water, lasting for about a month. But this year, due to the construction of six large reservoirs in 1958 and 1959, the flood of the Chaobai River was reduced from 3,100 cubic meters per second to 400 cubic meters per second after being blocked by the reservoirs, the Yongding River was reduced from 3,700 cubic meters per second to 627 cubic meters per second, the Shahe River in the southern branch of the Daqing River was reduced from 6,000 cubic meters per second to 4,000 cubic meters per second, the Tang River was reduced from 2,480 cubic meters per second to 310 cubic meters per second, the Ci River was reduced from 1,100 cubic meters per second to 180 cubic meters per second, and the Hutuo River was reduced from 3,000 cubic meters per second to 866 cubic meters per second. None of the floods exceeded the river channel capacity. Some small and medium-sized tributaries that had reservoirs built on them had all the floods blocked and stored, and no water was discharged. The masses said: "Of thousands and tens of thousands, the Party's leadership is the first, and of thousands of plans, the general line is the first plan." The victory of water conservancy construction fully illustrates this truth.

　　The great power of the general line and the policy of walking on two legs is also fully demonstrated in the development of China's electric power industry. From the Great Leap Forward in 1958 to the present, all employees have fully exerted the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and an average of 10,000 kilowatts of generating equipment has been put into production every two and a half days, and the power generation every forty days is equal to the total power generation in 1949. Especially after the implementation of the policy of combining the central and local governments and combining large, medium, and small projects, the enthusiasm of leaders at all levels in the local areas has been fully exerted, and many provinces across the country have rapidly developed a complete set of technical teams for design, installation, and production management. Due to the great attention and hard work of the local party committees, the leadership of construction and production is more specific and powerful, thus greatly improving the construction speed and production management level. In 1959, the Shanghai Wujing Thermal Power Plant installed a 25,000-kilowatt unit. Thanks to the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the strong support of seventeen industrial units, everything from technology to materials was available. From groundbreaking to putting into production, it only took six months, shortening the time by four-fifths compared with the past. Although this is only one of many examples, it can also be seen the general situation of the vigorous development of power construction across the country.

　　The socialist transformation of agriculture, especially the people's commune movement, is the source of strength for the rapid development of China's water conservancy and hydropower construction. Water conservancy and hydropower construction requires unified arrangements for water storage and discharge, and requires full cooperation from the people in the upper and lower reaches, and on the left and right banks. It requires a communist spirit of the minority obeying the majority, the local obeying the whole, and temporary interests obeying long-term interests to realize the rational planning of water conservancy and hydropower construction. The establishment of people's communes is the result of the Chinese peasants' demand to expand the scope of cooperation in economic construction. After its establishment, it became the backing for large-scale construction. The people's commune movement in our country first developed in Xinyang and Xinxiang in Henan, and Xushui in Hebei, and these areas are precisely the areas where water conservancy construction is extremely developed. In the upsurge of water conservancy construction, the local people deeply felt that the relatively small-scale cooperatives could not fully meet the requirements of economic construction cooperation; in addition, after the rectification and anti-rightist movement, the people's communist consciousness was raised, and the large and public people's communes came into being. For example, to build a reservoir, many lands must be submerged, and many people in the reservoir area must be relocated; to build a canal or a dike, many farmlands must also be dug and pressed. This is not an easy problem to solve in any capitalist country; but after the realization of cooperation and people's communes in our country, the private land ownership system was completely eliminated, and this difficult problem became easy, and the people in the reservoir area did not leave their land with tears in their eyes like in capitalist countries, but with gongs and drums, welcoming and sending off, one family moved safely, and thousands of families were happy. Water conservancy construction is the basic construction of agriculture, which requires funds and labor. Under the conditions of establishing cooperatives and people's communes, if labor is arranged uniformly, a huge amount of labor can be spared to engage in water conservancy construction. If land is arranged uniformly, it can be based on the conditions of suitability for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In addition to agricultural production, mountains can be managed, water can be managed, trees can be planted, and forests can be created, increasing immediate wealth and accumulating long-term wealth. To build the Miyun Reservoir, the people's communes in Hebei and Beijing invested 200,000 laborers. The river network project on the north bank of the Huai River requires digging 150,000 to 250,000 cubic meters of soil per square kilometer, creating conditions for the happiness of future generations, and at the same time, it does not delay the agricultural production of the year. Without the people's communes, these achievements would be unimaginable. Therefore, the people's communes are not something that anyone can impose on 500 million people, but what the people have seen with their own eyes. In the people's communes, the mountains have become flower and fruit mountains, the water has become long-flowing water, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery have all developed rapidly. Manual labor will gradually be replaced by mechanical operations, so they enthusiastically demand and develop them. Therefore, it has infinite vitality. No matter how the imperialists and right-leaning opportunists fabricate rumors and slander, it will inevitably emit huge heat and brilliant light more and more strongly.

　　In reviewing the achievements of China's water conservancy and electric power construction in the past ten years, we cannot but express our heartfelt gratitude to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and other brotherly countries. In the early days of our founding, when we still lacked experience in water conservancy and electric power construction, the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries provided us with important technical assistance and helped solve many mechanical equipment that our country could not manufacture at that time. Some important power plants were directly built with the help of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, enabling us to learn a complete set of experience in construction and production management in a short period of time. In the basin planning of huge rivers such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River and the design and construction of certain major projects, the Soviet Union's scientific research and design, construction, and other departments also provided us with significant assistance. These experiences have played a significant role in the management of rivers throughout the country. It should be particularly pointed out that the assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries not only solves specific technical problems, but also plays a great role in helping the development and growth of China's technical forces. Through the practice of water conservancy and electric power construction in the past ten years, China has a technical team with modern levels in water conservancy and electric power. At the same time, the broad masses of the people have exerted a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their enthusiastic labor. In terms of electricity, we have been able to completely rely on our own strength to design and build 650,000-kilowatt high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power stations and over 1 million-kilowatt hydropower stations. In terms of water conservancy and hydropower construction, we can build a sluice gate with a flow of 10,000 cubic meters per second in a few months. We can simultaneously start construction of more than a dozen dams with a height of 50 meters to 109 meters of various types of dams such as earth dams, rockfill dams

　　水利和电力建设的
　　大跃进水利电力部部长　傅作义
    水利是农业的命脉，电力是工业的先行，可是在解放以前，我国水利和电力建设都非常落后。
    我国水利资源十分丰富。全国河流的平均年总流量约有二万六千八百亿立方米，只要拿出这些流量的一半用于灌溉，就可使全国现有耕地面积每亩得到八百立方米的灌溉水量，以保证农作物的高产稳收。可是在旧中国，水旱灾害十分严重。仅根据黄河流域不完全的统计，过去三千年间，就曾发生水灾一千五百多次，旱灾一千零七十三次，每次发生巨大灾害，都有几十万、几百万人民饥馑、死亡。
    我国电力工业，在解放前虽然有六十七年的历史，但是规模很小，发展很慢，而且一开始就是帝国主义经济的附庸。电站的分布极不合理，90％以上的设备集中在帝国主义国家直接控制的东北和沿海少数大城市。不但设备陈旧，型号庞杂，而且往往在同一城市内，也不能由一个中心电站或统一的电网供电，而是各个帝国主义国家都有自己控制的供电区，分别供给不同规格的电力。电力工业的这种分区割据、各自为政的现象，充分反映了半殖民地的特点，而且为解放后的恢复和改造造成了重重障碍。
    从中华人民共和国成立到今年这十年里，我国经济建设获得了空前未有的巨大发展。特别是经过1958年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，我国水利和电力建设已经根本上改变了解放前的落后情况。
    水利建设初步改变了山河面貌
    在解放前，我国没有一条河流进行过全流域的有系统的治理开发。十年来，我们对于我国几条主要的巨大河流，如淮河、黄河、海河、珠江、辽河、长江和松花江，都已在不同程度上开始进行治理开发，有的已经受到基本控制，有的即将受到基本控制，有的也做了重要的防洪工程。同时，在小型为主、社办为主、蓄水为主的“三主”方针的指导下，对山区水土保持、山区水利化、灌溉和洼涝地区的治理，都创造了新的经验，并得到普遍的推广。这些成就已经使我国的山河面貌发生了重要的改变。
    1951年开始根治淮河。八年来，我们已经在它的上中游修筑了九座大型水库和十几处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，还有两座水库正在动工。在下游，完成了和正在修筑苏北灌溉总渠和分淮入沂两条可以分洪、可以灌溉的巨大的渠道。同时，对于上中下游干支河道的堤防，都进行了整修加固工程。目前正在安徽修筑的临淮岗水库，将直接控制淮河干流，在洪泽湖以上造成一个新的梯级，把淮河中游的防洪能力提高到防御百年一遇的洪水，并且可以大量发展灌溉。江苏正在修筑的引淮入沂工程则将把淮水北调，以分泄一部分洪水，并灌溉江苏废黄河以北的广大地区。配合其他工程，淮河下游的防洪能力将提高到足以防御三百年一遇的洪水。对淮北易旱易涝地区的治理，自1958年开始大规模修筑河网化工程以来，不但可以减免旱涝灾害，同时还改种了一部分稻田。
    1931年淮河发生巨大洪水，淹地七千多万亩，据记载，从洪泽湖口流过的汛期八十天的总水量是三百六十四亿立方米。现在我们已经修成的工程和正在兴修的工程，设计总容量为二百九十五点八亿立方米，其中防洪容量为二百二十八点六八亿立方米，加上大量的小型工程和排水工程的作用，像1931年那样的洪水灾害已经是一去不复返了。这二百九十五点八亿立方米的蓄水容积，其中有大约八十四点三三亿立方米是可以用于兴利的。这就为大规模发展灌溉和水力发电以及调节中下游航道的常年水量，创造了极为有利的条件。
    黄河是一条世界知名的含沙量最大并且善淤善徙善决的河流。在过去三千年间，它平均两年发生一次决口泛滥的灾害，陕州流量在一万秒立方米以上，下游就有90％以上的可能发生决口。从1946年黄河下游地区解放起，黄河下游两岸一千八百公里的堤防埽坝工程，就都进行了整修改建。我们在十四年间，曾经防御十七次流量在一万秒立方米以上的洪水，都没有决口成灾。其中1958年的洪水，花园口流量达到二万二千三百秒立方米，与1933年发生巨大灾害的洪水相类似，也能够安全下泄。
    1955年全国人民代表大会通过了黄河流域规划，黄河的治理开始进入一个新的阶段。控制黄河总流域面积92％、蓄水三百五十四亿立方米、占全河多年平均总水量75％的三门峡水利枢纽工程，明年就可以拦洪，并争取开始发电。这是控制黄河、兴利除害的关键性工程，从明年起，黄河下游的洪水威胁，即可基本免除。在1958年大跃进的形势下，干流上以发电灌溉为主的许多梯级，如甘肃的刘家峡、盐锅峡，宁夏的青铜峡，内蒙古的三盛公，山东的位山等水利枢纽工程，都已开始施工。为了减少黄河的含沙量，延长这些枢纽工程的使用年限，并发展广大山区高原的生产，流域内水土流失最严重的黄土高原地区四十三万平方公里，已有十五万平方公里开始做了水土保持工作，将逐步发生蓄水保土的作用。下游地区已经修筑六处大型灌区，并且做了大量的虹吸工程。群众性的水利运动，将大大缩短根治黄河的预定期限，数千年来无法制服、横冲直闯、危害人民的黄河，我们仅仅用了十年，就使它驯服地听从人民指挥，而且还要收到巨大的灌溉和发电的效益。
    海河流域是一个水量根本不够的地区，可是因为全年雨量集中，也经常发生严重的洪水和内涝灾害。我们努力的目标是大中小工程相结合，全部控制海河水量，以消除洪涝灾害，同时大力开发地下水，并且引用黄河水量，大量发展灌溉、水电和航运事业。目前我们在海河流域的主要河流上，已经修筑和正在修筑七座大型水库和两条减河，其中密云水库的总容量即为四十一亿立方米。同时还在大清河、子牙河、南运河汇流处，修筑了西河闸蓄水工程，在海河干流上修筑了拒咸蓄淡的挡潮闸工程。
    要彻底消除旱灾和保证农作物的高产稳收，海河流域的灌溉需水总量约为四百三十多亿立方米，而海河的多年平均总水量则为一百四十五亿立方米。目前我们已经完成和正在修筑的大型水库总库容约为九十九亿立方米，白洋淀和东淀的蓄水容量约为三十亿立方米，已经控制了海河的大部水量。海河流域引用地下水灌溉，这几年也有巨大的发展，并且普遍推广了机械提水灌溉。黄河北岸的人民胜利渠和位山引水闸，都可引黄河水流经过卫河和南运河直达天津，这些工程对于改变海河流域的干旱面貌，将逐步发生重大的作用。由于大量地修了蓄水工程，海河流域的洪水和内涝灾害，也将逐步受到控制。
    长江是我国最大的河流，入海总水量约达一万亿立方米，水能蕴藏量二点三亿瓩，万吨轮船可以通航一千一百公里。对于这样一条影响巨大的河流的治理和开发，需要规模很大的准备工作，因而也需要较长的时间。为了防止它发生严重水灾，并且为进行根治开发争取时间，我们首先整修了沿江的干支堤防，并且在洪水灾害比较严重的中游地区，修筑了规模巨大的荆江分洪及其他蓄洪垦殖工程。对洞庭湖也进行了初步的整理。与此同时，我们已经对长江全流域水利资源的开发进行了大规模的勘测研究，已经编成综合开发的流域规划要点。1958年和1959年有些支流上的局部性工程，如江西赣抚平原灌溉工程、四川紫坪铺、湖南柘溪、江西柘林等大型水电站，都已开始施工。在它最大的支流汉江上，除已修筑汉江下游分洪工程以外，1958年开始修筑具有控制性的丹江口水库工程。这个水库设计蓄水量二百八十三亿立方米。完成以后，可以基本解除汉江下游严重的洪水灾害，还可以得到一千二百万亩灌溉和九十万瓩的水力发电的效益，并且为将来把长江流域的水源引到黄河、淮河和华北地区创造了有利的条件。至于控制长江上游全部水量的伟大的三峡水利枢纽，则正在积极进行勘测设计研究工作。“高峡出平湖”这种宏伟的图景，在不久的将来就会成为现实。
    珠江年平均水量三千七百亿立方米，是我国仅次于长江的第二条大河。我们一方面在进行根治和开发的准备工作，同时根据工农业生产的紧急需要，开始修筑了一部分工程，如流溪河水电站、北江防洪工程等，同时对三角洲地区复杂的堤围工程，进行了整修改建，修筑了一部分灌溉排水的闸坝工程。1959年在东江开始修筑新丰江水电站，蓄水容量为一百一十五亿立方米，明年可以拦洪发电。
    对于东北的辽河，我们已经完成了支流浑河大伙房水库，现正修筑支流青河新立屯水库。对于松花江，我们整修了丰满水库。
    各地中小河流的治理，在地方党政领导下，都有迅速的发展，有的已经做全面的治理开发，成为全国江河治理工作的楷模。
    和江河治理工作相配合，在农田水利方面，通过1952和1956年两次水利高潮和1958年的大跃进，共修筑中小型水库渠道四百多万处，塘坝一千五百多万处，水井一千一百多万眼，排灌动力机械二百九十多万马力。全国灌溉面积已经由1949年的二点四亿亩发展到现在的十亿亩左右，相当于几千年来累积形成的灌溉总面积的三倍以上，灌溉面积占耕地的比例，由1949年的16.3％，发展到现在的60％以上。虽然有些灌区还需要平整土地、修筑田间工程或配备提水工具，才能完全发挥效益，但是对战胜今年的严重旱灾，已经表现出重大的作用。
    发电设备增长三点六倍，发电量增长八倍
    我国电力工业的发展，在国民经济恢复时期，根据党的恢复和发展生产、挖掘潜力、厉行节约的方针，主要是对原有的电力工业进行了巨大的恢复与改造工作。按照社会主义企业的管理原则，实行了民主改革，加强了技术管理，对原有设备进行了恢复性的检修，从而使我国的电力生产，在基本上没有增加设备的情况下，到1952年，全国发电量就超过了历史上最高年份发电量的22％。经过第一个五年计划时期的生产改革和大规模建设，到1957年为止，全国发电量已经达到一百九十三亿度，发电设备容量增加到四百六十三点五万瓩。第一个五年计划期间，发电量的年平均递增率为21.6％。这样快的发展速度是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。
    第一个五年计划时期，为了适应工业发展特别是新工业地区建设的需要，除积极扩建了原有电站外，并且大规模地在新兴工业地区进行了电站的建设；与此同时，大力地进行了水力资源的勘测工作，普查了全国的主要河流，选择了一批优良的水力发电地址，为以后大规模地开展水电建设创造了条件。五年内，新建和扩建了七十六座火力和水力发电站，增加了发电设备容量二百四十七万瓩（火力一百八十四万瓩、水力六十三万瓩），超过了原定计划的20％。在电站建设中，采用了现代的新技术，提高了机械化、自动化的程度，并且按照集中供应工业用热的方针，建设了一批热电站。随着发电站的增加和供电地区的扩大，输电线路和变电站也有了很大增长。第一个五年计划期间，输电线路增加了四千七百八十一公里，变电站设备增加了四百零六万千伏安，分别比1949年增长了40％和113％。新电站的建设和电力网的形成，不仅保证了工业建设的用电，同时也使我国电力工业原来在地区分布上的极不合理的状况，有了很大的改变。例如电力工业基础薄弱的西北地区，到1957年末，发电设备比过去增加了十六点八倍，西南地区也比过去增加了二点七倍。少数民族地区，在党和政府的密切关怀下，为了适应经济建设的需要，在新工业区从无到有地建设了一批火力和水力发电站，并开始形成现代化的电力基地。
    1958年是我国大跃进的一年，随着工农业生产的全面跃进，电力工业也获得了前所未有的跃进。去年全国发电量达到二百七十五亿度，比1957年增加了42.5％；新增加的发电设备容量达一百七十九点七万瓩（不包括城市与农村群众自办小型电站），为1957年新增发电设备容量的二点四倍，约等于第一个五年计划期间全部新增设备容量的四分之三。在大跃进中，生产和基本建设工作，都取得了新的成绩。在生产方面，通过许多重要的技术改革，把主要生产设备的检修工期缩短了一半，定期检修之间的间隔也延长了一倍；大部分设备都提高了出力；并且在一些高压输电线路上施行了升高电压增加供电能力的措施和广泛推行了不停电检修等方法。这就使设备利用率有了空前的提高，进一步地发挥了生产潜力。发电设备的年利用小时数达到五千五百一十八小时，比1957年提高了15％，等于1949年的二点三倍。主要的经济指标也都有了显著的改善。例如：每发一度电所消耗的标准煤，全国平均达到零点五五九公斤，比1957年下降了7.5％，而比1949年减少了45％；一些先进电厂的煤耗率，年平均达到零点三五一公斤；全国平均，线路损失率达到7.57％，也比1957年减少了19％，比1949年减少了三分之二以上。由于消耗指标的降低和经营管理的改善，售电单位成本比1957年降低了3.2％。在基本建设方面，开展了速度快、质量高、造价省、安全好的群众运动，合理地降低了某些过高的建筑标准，并且推行了许多行之有效的技术措施，改进了工程的设计和改善了施工管理，从而电站的建设造价约比第一个五年计划期间降低了一半左右，施工期限一般地也都缩短了一半左右。比如一座高温高压热电站从破土施工到开始发电的期限，由过去的二十五个月缩短到十三个月；大型水电工程，像三门峡水电站（最终容量一百一十万瓩），施工期限将由1962年提前到1960年拦洪并争取发电；新安江水电站的施工期限比计划缩短了一年以上。这样快的速度，是大跃进以前很难设想的。
    1958年在建设大中型电站的同时，还在农村和一部分中小城市大规模开展了群众办电运动。仅是农村建成的小型水电站就有十五万瓩，比过去增加了五倍多。群众办电运动的开展，是电力工业的一次巨大的普及运动，使电力工业取得了广泛的群众基础。
    1959年我国国民经济正在继续大跃进。上半年的工业生产比去年同期增加了65％，全国上半年的发电量也比去年同期增加了55％。最近党的八届八中全会，向全国人民提出了在今年提前三年完成第二个五年计划最后一年（1962年）主要指标的伟大号召以后，一个轰轰烈烈的、波澜壮阔的生产高潮已在全国形成。为了保证国民经济急剧增长的用电需要，电力工业今年要超额完成发电量三百九十亿度。这个计划比1958年的发电量增加了42％。完成或超额完成这一计划后，今年电力的生产就接近甚至达到第二个五年计划原定的发电四百亿度到四百三十亿度的水平。从目前国民经济建设用电急剧增长的趋势看来，达到或超过四百亿度的水平是完全可能的，这是一个更大的跃进。今年基本建设的装机计划，预计到年底可完成二百三十万瓩，相当于第一个五年计划期间新增发电设备容量的90％以上，为1958年大跃进中新增发电设备容量的128％。为了完成今年的生产和建设计划，电力工业的全体职工，正在斗志昂扬，干劲冲天地投入了增产节约运动，广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛，信心百倍地为完成今年电力工业的计划任务而斗争。
    今年的建设计划完成后，发电设备比1949年增长三点六倍，发电量增长八倍以上。在全国将形成二十五个十一万伏以上的电力系统，包括了全国80％以上的发电设备。十万瓩以上的电力系统将由恢复时期的三个增加到十八个，最大的电力系统将达到二百七十万瓩；高温高压发电设备容量所占的比重也将由1949年的1％提高到27％；单机容量在二点五至十万瓩的大型汽轮发电机组，将占火电设备总量的40％；水电设备容量所占比重，也将由1949年的8.8％提高到18％。我国电力工业的生产技术水平，将获得进一步的提高。
　　水利和电力的大发展是总路线、大跃进和人民公社化的大胜利
    十年来我国水利和电力建设的伟大胜利，是伟大的中国共产党领导的胜利；是在总路线的光辉照耀下，在一整套两条腿走路的方针和水利建设“三主”方针的指导下，大搞群众运动的胜利；是我国社会主义建设和农业的社会主义改造、特别是人民公社运动的胜利。
    我国地域广大，人口众多，而经济上却是一穷二白。用最快的速度改变这种落后的状况，是亿万人民的热烈愿望。在水利方面这种情况表现得特别显明。因为自然降雨，变化无常，真是天有不测风云，许多水利工程，只要快修，多修，早一天发挥效益，就有可能防止巨大的洪水灾害，挽救无可补偿的生命损失，保护大面积农业生产和重要城市、工矿、交通的安全。党的领导集中地反映了广大人民的这种热烈愿望。党所领导的农业的社会主义改造，解放了五亿农民几千年来被束缚的手脚；党的群众路线的工作方法，唤醒了六亿人民用自己的力量来改变自己的命运。千百万党员同志在全国各个角落，在水利建设的最前线，发挥了先锋骨干作用。党所提出的总路线，更是动员的号角，上阵的旗鼓。因而我国的水利建设，建国十年来，一直是以最快的速度、最大的规模向前发展，在1958年以来，更以排山倒海的英雄气概，出现了一年超过几千年的大跃进，成为全国工农业生产大跃进的前浪。
    我国水利建设十年来的成就，特别是这些水利工程在今年的严重水旱灾害中所发挥的效用，鲜明地说明了总路线的光辉胜利，大跃进的光辉胜利。十年来我国人民在水利建设方面共做了土石方工程八百亿立方米，平排起来，可以围绕地球赤道一千九百七十一周，其中就有五百八十亿立方米，是1958年一年所做的。今年我国十七个省区，在作物需水最多的三伏时期，遭受了严重的旱灾，受旱总面积约达三亿二千万亩，旱灾的严重情况和1928至1944年的六次大旱灾相类似。在1928和1944年，许多地方是赤地千里，饿殍载道；而在今年却有两亿多亩农田摆脱了干旱的威胁。只淮河流域所修的水库和洪泽湖蓄水就灌溉了农田一千四百万亩，淮北河网化工程和中小型水库塘坝，保证了二千七百万亩农田的丰收。山东、河南两省自黄河引水灌溉农田一千四百八十九万亩，河南受旱八千万亩，都在不同程度上得到了灌溉。今年华北海河流域下了多次集中的暴雨，雨量相当于1949年。在暴雨中心地区，还大于1949年和解放以前的1917、1939年。1949年河北省受灾面积达四千余万亩，1917和1939年，洪水侵入天津市，有些街道水深达两米，持续约一月。可是今年，由于1958年到1959年抢修了六座大型水库，潮白河的洪水经过水库拦洪，由三千一百秒立方米减为四百秒立方米，永定河由三千七百秒立方米减为六百二十七秒立方米，大清河南支沙河由六千秒立方米减为四千秒立方米，唐河由二千四百八十秒立方米减为三百一十秒立方米，磁河由一千一百秒立方米减为一百八十秒立方米，滹沱河由三千秒立方米减为八百六十六秒立方米。洪水都没有超过河道容量。有些修了水库的中小支流，洪水全部拦蓄，滴水没有下泄。群众说：“千条万条，党的领导是第一条，千计万计，总路线是第一计”，水利建设的胜利充分说明了这个道理。
    在我国电力工业的发展中，也充分地表现了总路线和两条腿走路方针的巨大威力。从1958年大跃进到现在，全体职工充分发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义精神，平均二天半就有一万瓩的发电设备投入生产，每四十天的发电量就等于1949年全年的发电量。特别是在实行中央与地方并举、大中小并举的方针以后，充分发挥了地方上各级领导的积极性，全国很多省份都迅速长成了设计、安装、生产管理一整套的技术队伍。由于各地方党委大抓狠抓，对建设和生产的领导更为具体而有力，因而大大提高了建设速度和生产管理水平。1959年上海吴泾热电厂安装一台二万五千瓩的机组，由于上海市委的领导，十七个工业单位大力支援，从技术到物资，要什么有什么，从破土开工到投入生产，只用了六个多月的时间，比过去缩短五分之四。这虽然只是许多事例中的一个，也可以看出全国电力建设蓬勃发展的一般情况。
    农业的社会主义改造，特别是人民公社运动，是我国水利水电建设迅速发展的力量的源泉。水利和水电建设需要对水的蓄泄作统一安排，需要上下游、左右岸各个地区人民的充分协作，需要有少数服从多数、局部服从整体、暂时利益服从长远利益的共产主义精神，才能实现水利和水电建设的合理规划。人民公社的成立正是我国农民在经济建设上要求扩大协作范围的结果，在它成立以后，又成为大规模进行建设的靠山。我国人民公社运动，是在河南的信阳、新乡，河北的徐水等地首先发展起来的，而这些地区正是水利建设极为发展的地区。当地人民在兴办水利的高潮中，深深感到规模比较狭小的合作社，不能充分满足经济建设协作的要求；再加上在整风反右以后，人民的共产主义觉悟提高，一大二公的人民公社就应运而生。比如要修一个水库，就必须淹没很多土地，水库区有很多人民必须迁移；要修一个渠道或一道堤防，也必须挖压很多农田。这在任何资本主义国家，都不是一个容易解决的问题；可是在我国实现合作化和人民公社化以后，彻底消灭了土地私有制度，这个困难的问题就变成轻而易举，水库区的人民不是像资本主义国家一样含着眼泪离开自己的土地，而是锣鼓喧天，欢迎欢送，一家迁安，万家幸福。水利建设是农业的基本建设，需要资金，需要劳力。在成立合作社和人民公社的条件下，劳动力统一安排，就可以富余出巨大的劳力以从事水利建设，土地统一安排，就可以根据宜农、宜林、宜牧的条件，在农业生产以外，治山治水，植树造林，增殖眼前的财富，累积长远的财富。修筑密云水库，河北和北京的人民公社投入了二十万劳动力。淮河北岸的河网化工程，每平方公里要挖土十五至二十五万立方米，一方面为子孙万代的幸福创造了条件，同时还没有耽误当年的农业生产。如果没有人民公社，这些成就是不可设想的。所以，人民公社不是任何人能够强加在五亿人民身上的，而是人民自己亲眼看见，在人民公社里，山变成了花果山，水变成了长流水，农林牧副渔都得到了迅速发展，体力劳动将逐步为机械操作所代替，因而热烈要求，发展起来的。所以它有无穷的生命力。不管帝国主义和右倾机会主义分子是怎样地造谣毁谤，它必然会越来越强烈地发出巨大的热力和灿烂的光辉。
    在回顾我国十年来水利和电力建设的成就时，我们不能不对我们伟大盟邦苏联和其他兄弟国家表示衷心的感激。在我们建国初期，水利和电力建设经验还十分缺乏的时候，苏联和其他兄弟国家就在技术方面给了我们重要的帮助，并且帮助解决了我国当时所不能制造的许多机械设备。有些重要的电厂，是由苏联和其他兄弟国家直接帮助建成的，使我们在短期内学会了建设和生产管理一整套的经验。在黄河、长江这些巨大河流的流域规划和某些重大工程的设计施工方面，苏联的科学研究和设计、施工等部门，也给了我们重大的帮助。这些经验在全国各个河流的治理中都发挥了重大的作用。特别应该指出的是苏联和其他兄弟国家对我们的援助，不只是解决具体的技术问题，而且在帮助我国技术力量的发育成长上起了很大的作用。十年来通过水利电力建设的实践，我国在水利和电力方面，都已经有了一支拥有现代水平的技术队伍。同时，广大群众在热情的劳动中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。在电力方面，我们已经能够完全依靠自己的力量，设计和建设六十五万瓩的高温高压火电站，一百万瓩以上的水电站。在水利和水电建设方面，我们几个月就可修成一座过水一万秒立方米的水闸。我们能够在一年内同时开工修筑十几座坝高五十米到一百零九米的土坝、堆石坝、重力坝、连拱坝、大头坝等各种类型的大坝。我们水利电力的技术水平在许多方面已经达到了国际水平。饮水思源，我国人民对于我们伟大盟邦的良师益友，在心灵深处滋长着一种深深的感激。这种纯真的友情，像我国的长江、黄河一样，滔滔不尽，万古长流。
    最后，我们还应该指出，十年来我国水利和电力建设的成就只是一个伟大的开端，还不能解决所有的问题。就水利方面来说，我国地域广阔，各个地区存在着极不相同的自然条件，目前我们对全国各个河流所进行的治理开发工作还是不平衡的，有些河流已经有条件控制较大的洪水，有些河流则还只能防御普通的洪水。在水源不足的地区还面临着严重的干旱的威胁。在水源较多地区，也要作更多的蓄水工程，才能调节全年水量，解决交替发生的旱涝灾害。就电力方面来说，由于国民经济的急遽发展，在某些地区电力的增长还不能完全适应工业发展的需要，不同程度的缺电现象仍然存在。但是，我们深信有党的领导，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉照耀下，全国人民高举红旗，继续前进，在水利和电力建设方面，即将掀起一个接连一个的高潮，从而以最大的速度，逐步解决上述问题，为国家的电气化和水利化做出巨大的成就。
