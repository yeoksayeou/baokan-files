Xinhua News Agency, October 8th. Vice Premier of the State Council, Ulanhu, convened a symposium today at the Cultural Palace of Nationalities with the leaders of the national minority observation groups and youth study groups who came to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

At the symposium, Ulanhu said that the achievements of the People's Republic of China in the past decade are glorious, great, and unprecedented. This is true from a national perspective, and also from the perspective of ethnic work. He said that in the past ten years, the Party's ethnic policies have achieved glorious and great victories. The establishment of the Cultural Palace of Nationalities and the content of the ethnic work exhibition over the past decade powerfully demonstrate that the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is completely correct, that the Party and Chairman Mao have consistently given the most affectionate care to the development of all ethnic minorities, that our country is unified, that all ethnic groups are closely united, that socialist ethnic relations have been established, and are constantly being consolidated and developed. The de facto inequality between ethnic groups is being gradually eliminated, and the differences between ethnic groups are gradually disappearing. The people of all ethnic groups have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Vice Premier Ulanhu pointed out that the main task of the people of all ethnic groups at present is to resolutely implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. When talking about the tasks of ethnic work in the future, he emphasized: (1) All ethnic groups must resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to realize the Great Leap Forward, and gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups in the Great Leap Forward. (2) In the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, all ethnic groups must further unite and cooperate, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, help each other, and support each other. (3) Now, whether in areas where ethnic groups live in mixed communities or in concentrated communities, the people's commune system has basically been realized. The people's commune has brought the development of ethnic relations to a new stage and has powerfully promoted the leap forward in production and construction in ethnic minority areas. In the future, all ethnic groups within the people's communes must further strengthen unity and cooperation and develop together. (4) We must vigorously carry out mass movements. Revolution and construction cannot be separated from mass movements. Ethnic minority areas must also fully mobilize the masses in the future leap forward. (5) The Tibet region should continue to fully mobilize the masses, implement the Party's various policies, thoroughly complete democratic reform, and build a new, democratic, and socialist Tibet. (6) It is necessary to strengthen the ranks of the working class in ethnic minority areas, train ethnic minority cadres needed for all aspects of socialist construction, study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works diligently, and continue to conduct in-depth patriotism and socialist education. (7) On the basis of the achievements in ethnic work over the past ten years, the people of all ethnic groups should continue to consolidate the unity of the motherland and strengthen ethnic unity, and strive for new and greater achievements under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

At the symposium, representatives of all ethnic groups spoke enthusiastically, using vivid facts from their regions and what they had seen and heard in the capital and other places to illustrate how the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have continuously brought prosperity and happiness to the socialist family of the motherland. They expressed their confidence that in the future they would hold even higher the glorious banner of the general line and continue to leap forward on the broad socialist road guided by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Bainqen Erdene Qoigyi Gyaincain, Vice Chairman Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme also attended the symposium.

Also participating in the symposium were Xie Fumin, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, and Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission.
