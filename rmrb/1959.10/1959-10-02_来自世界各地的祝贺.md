Respected Comrade Chen Yi!
On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend to you my heartfelt warm congratulations and greetings.
The founding of the People's Republic of China is a historic event of great significance in the lives of the Chinese people and in the history of mankind.
Today, the People's Republic of China plays a major role in strengthening the unity and power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and in defending peace in Asia and the world.
The traditional relationship of friendly cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China, forged in the struggle against foreign aggressors, has been further strengthened and developed through the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the armed aggression of the common enemy, US imperialism.
The Chinese people not only aided us with blood during the most difficult period of our people's Fatherland Liberation War, but also provided tremendous assistance in the post-war recovery and construction, and continue to provide great assistance to our country's socialist construction.
This active support and solidarity from the fraternal Chinese people greatly encourages the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their homeland and the construction of socialism.
I wish you greater achievements in strengthening the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Korea and China and in the noble cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Respected Comrade Soong Ching Ling! Dear Friends!
The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association sincerely congratulates you, and through you, the fraternal Chinese people, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Dear friends, the Soviet people, the people of the socialist camp, and all progressive mankind celebrate this glorious festival in the life of the Chinese people together with you.
Under the leadership of its Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved a leap from backwardness to progress in a short ten years, and are rapidly transforming People's China into a powerful socialist power.
The international prestige of the People's Republic of China has been enhanced beyond comparison. Together with the socialist brother countries, the new China resolutely implements Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence; struggles to strengthen the unity and increase the power of the socialist camp; and gives firm support to the oppressed nations. The People's Republic of China's lofty struggle for peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries has won the love and respect of all peace-loving and progressive people in the world.
The Soviet people sincerely take pride in the outstanding achievements of our friends and brothers, the Chinese people, because every victory you have achieved on the road to socialism is a victory for the entire socialist camp.
The unity and friendship between our two great powers, born out of the common struggle against common enemies and for the victory of the cause of communism, is a powerful source of our rapid progress. The relations between our two countries, based on the principles of socialist internationalism, are an example of truly fraternal and equal cooperation. The Soviet people are proud of their friendship with the Chinese people. In the future, the Soviet people will also tirelessly consolidate this friendship, because the unity of our two peoples is related to the cause of peace and the bright future of all mankind.
The multifaceted and fruitful activities carried out by our two friendship associations serve the noble purpose of strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The Soviet people express their sincere gratitude to all members of the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Chinese-Soviet Friendship Associations, and you personally, Respected Comrade Soong Ching Ling, for your efforts to promote the development of friendly ties and fraternal cooperation between our two peoples.
Dear friends! On the day of your glorious tenth anniversary, we warmly congratulate you and wish the entire Chinese people—our faithful friends, brothers, and allies—new achievements in the great cause of socialist construction.
Long live the People's Republic of China!

Telegram of Congratulations from World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
As the Chinese people celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with due pride, the World Federation of Trade Unions extends its warmest congratulations to the Chinese working people, the Chinese trade unions, and the leaders of the Chinese people. The World Federation of Trade Unions fully recognizes that under the experienced and outstanding leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, the Chinese trade unions closely participated in the magnificent work of economic and social transformation of your country. Ten years ago, the working people all over the world celebrated the founding of the Chinese workers' and peasants' state with joy, regarding it as a decisive factor in strengthening world peace and promoting the collapse of the colonialist system, and as a historically significant event. Since then, they have watched the exemplary victories achieved by the creative labor of the Chinese brothers with admiration and deep sympathy. They have expressed unbreakable solidarity with the Chinese workers, which has been increasingly strengthened with the growing influence of the Chinese trade unions in international trade union organizations. The World Federation of Trade Unions condemns the stubborn attitude of the imperialist groups in refusing to recognize the government freely elected by the 600 million Chinese people, and considers it unreasonable and contrary to the interests of world peace. The World Federation of Trade Unions, together with the workers of the world, once again rejoices in the strength of the forces of peace and the international prestige that the People's Republic of China has gained in ten years due to the close unity of the people of the whole country, the achievements in the economic field, and the socialist transformation, as well as the policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the workers of the world, congratulates the Chinese workers and trade unions for their significant achievements in the cause of strengthening international workers' friendship and unity, and wishes them new victories in building a socialist motherland!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Chinese workers and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!
Long live international workers' solidarity and peace!

    值此中华人民共和国成立十周年，我谨向您表示衷心的热烈祝贺和问候。
    中华人民共和国的成立，在中国人民的生活中，在人类的历史上，是具有巨大意义的历史性事件。

    兄弟的中国人民给予我们的这种积极支持和声援，大大鼓舞着朝鲜人民和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的斗争。
    祝您在为加强朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊，为亚洲和世界和平的崇高事业中，获得更大的成就。

    我们两个友好协会所进行的多方面的富有成效的活动，是为加强中苏两国人民友谊的崇高目的而服务的。苏联人民向中苏友好协会全体会员、中苏友好协会总会，和您个人，敬爱的宋庆龄同志，表示衷心的谢意，感谢你们竭尽全力地促使我们两国人民友好联系和兄弟般的合作的发展。

    世界工联总书记赛扬给全总的贺电
    当中国人民以应有的自豪心情庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年之际，世界工联谨向中国劳动人民、中国工会和中国人民的领导人致以最热烈的祝贺。世界工联充分认识到在光荣的中国共产党的有经验的杰出的领导下，中国工会紧密地参加了你们国家的经济和社会改造的宏伟工作。十年前，全世界劳动人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中国工农国家的成立，把它作为加强世界和平与促使殖民主义体系瓦解的决定性的因素和具有历史意义的事件。从那时以来，他们怀着赞美和深刻同情的心情注视着中国兄弟的创造性劳动所获得的模范的胜利。他们向中国工人表示了牢不可破的团结，这种团结随着中国工会在全世界工会组织中的影响不断扩大而日益加强。世界工联谴责帝国主义集团拒绝承认由六亿中国人民自由地选举出来的政府的顽固态度，并认为这是毫无道理的和违背全世界和平的利益的。世界工联和全世界劳动者在一起，再一次为和平力量的强大和中华人民共和国在十年中由于全国人民的亲密团结，在经济方面的成就和进行的社会主义改造，以及与各国人民和平友好的政策所获得的国际威望而高兴。世界工联代表全世界工人向在加强国际工人友谊与团结的事业中取得重大成就的中国工人和工会祝贺，祝他们在建设社会主义祖国中获得新的胜利！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国工人和中华全国总工会万岁！
    国际工人团结与和平万岁！
                            世界工联总书记　路易·赛扬
