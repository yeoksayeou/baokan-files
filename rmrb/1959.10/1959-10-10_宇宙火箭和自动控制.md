    Space Rockets and Automatic Control
    Yang Jiachen, Researcher at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    On the second anniversary of the Soviet Union's launch of the world's first artificial earth satellite, marking the second year of mankind's entry into the era of interstellar navigation, the Soviet Union once again successfully launched its third space rocket, less than a month after the launch of the second space rocket that hit the moon, taking another big step on the road of mankind's conquest of the universe.
    In these extraordinary two years, the launch of three artificial earth satellites and three space rockets has demonstrated that Soviet science and technology are advancing at an astonishing speed in the three aspects of high level, precision, and large scale. A comparison of the two most recently launched space rockets fully illustrates this leap in development speed. The multi-stage rocket launched this time is equipped with an automatic interplanetary station. Its orbit passes the moon at a distance of 7,000 kilometers and continues to fly, passing by the Earth from north to south on October 18. The scientific instruments installed on the automatic interplanetary station will more extensively investigate the various physical states of the cosmic space from the Earth to the Moon, thereby establishing the scientific foundation of interstellar physics. Because it bypasses the moon, it can measure the conditions on the far side of the moon and transmit them back to Earth, making important contributions to lunar physics, the origin of celestial bodies, and other sciences. The last stage of this space rocket, excluding fuel, weighs 1,553 kilograms, which is 42 kilograms heavier than the last stage of the second space rocket. Therefore, this multi-stage rocket is much heavier and has a much greater thrust than the second space rocket. The powerful rocket engine enables the Soviet Union to launch space rockets to the lunar region on any day. The precision of the orbit control system on the second space rocket had already stunned Western scientists, and this time, to make the rocket enter an orbit around the moon, the precision of the control system is even higher. Here, I would like to talk about the Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in automatic control technology related to launching rockets, based on these two launches of space rockets.
    The most outstanding achievement of the Soviet Union's second and third space rockets is undoubtedly their extremely precise orbit control system. This control system manipulates the rocket's orbit during the entire acceleration phase (approximately a few minutes). When the final stage of the rocket reaches the pre-calculated values for altitude, speed, and direction relative to the Earth, the rocket stops and enters a free-flight orbit. The control precision achieved by the Soviet Union's second space rocket ensured that the speed error at the end of the acceleration phase did not exceed one meter per second, which is one ten-thousandth of the full speed; the inclination angle error did not exceed one-tenth of a degree. The orbit chosen for the third space rocket required the speed at the end of the acceleration phase to be slightly lower than the second cosmic velocity (approximately 50 meters per second lower), allowing the space rocket to travel to the lunar region in two and a half days and nights. It requires more accurate motion parameters at the end of the acceleration phase. According to preliminary estimates, if the relative position of reaching the lunar region is to be equally accurate, the speed at the end of the acceleration phase must be four times more accurate. In order to correctly manipulate the rocket's orbit during the acceleration phase, the rocket must first have a very high-precision automatic navigation system. Based on the motion parameters measured by itself, the rocket automatically corrects its speed and direction through a fast, ultra-miniature computer on board. To prevent this system from deviating, especially in the last few seconds of the acceleration phase, it is very likely that radio waves will be used to measure the rocket's position, speed, and direction at a series of pre-arranged ground observation stations. A fast electronic computer is then used to calculate its deviation and correct it remotely. Because the space rocket is multi-stage, each stage of the rocket must detach from the advancing rocket after it is used up, and the latter must also be ignited in a timely manner. The timing of these detachments and ignitions must also be precisely controlled to ensure that the final stage rocket approaches or exceeds the second cosmic velocity and smoothly operates in the predetermined orbit. In addition to this, due to the moon's revolution around the Earth and the Earth's rotation, the predetermined orbit is only suitable for launch at a certain time, and the take-off time cannot differ by a few seconds. Launching a rocket weighing over a thousand tons is not a simple task. There must be a complete launch system, including fuel injection, final rocket verification, verification of various instruments, preparation of radio positioning and control equipment, communication with observation stations throughout the country, and the starting of the computer, etc. Without advanced automated equipment, it would be almost impossible to complete these tasks in a timely manner.
    In the entire system for launching space rockets, a malfunction in any component, whether in the rocket itself or in the ground control equipment, will affect the progress of the experiment; it may even cause the experiment to fail. These components include electron tubes, semiconductors, relays, small motors, and other control components. Several of the so-called "Pioneers" launched by the United States failed, possibly due to component failure. The Soviet Union's successful rocket launches every time prove that the reliability of the components they use far exceeds that of the United States. The control components used in rockets must be able to withstand the tests of acceleration and vibration. At the same time, the temperature in the rocket's instrument compartment and the automatic interplanetary station must be precisely regulated, which is also a necessary condition for ensuring the normal operation of the control system and scientific instruments.
    In order to obtain complete data on the rocket's motion throughout the entire flight phase, such as the rocket's position, speed, and azimuth, it is necessary to accurately measure it using an automated measurement system. This system includes measurement points arranged throughout the Soviet Union and a highly stable radio transmitter with a frequency of 183.6 megacycles on the rocket. All measurement points must have a unified time reference, and they form a linked system that effectively transmits the observed data to the calculation center for continuous processing. This complete system enables Soviet scientists to determine the precise time and location of the second space rocket's impact with the moon, with an accuracy of within 200 kilometers in measuring the position on the lunar surface.
    Various scientific instruments are installed on the automatic interplanetary station to continuously measure various scientific data on the orbit. In order to ensure that the ground receiving station can accurately receive this information, the automatic interplanetary station must record this information on magnetic tape and be remotely controlled by the ground to send it back at a faster speed. Approximately two hours are required to send back a day's worth of information. This automatic device has already been used on artificial earth satellites, but because the automatic interplanetary station is farther from the Earth, more reliable radio transceivers are required to ensure reliable use.
    Various scientific experiments and scientific exploration, like production technology, require a higher degree and requirement of automation as the technology becomes more advanced and cutting-edge. On the road of mankind's advance towards the goal of space navigation, future problems that must be further solved include the rocket's return to Earth, the establishment of unmanned scientific stations on the moon, and the automatic launching of rockets from the moon that can return to Earth. To complete these tasks, more arduous tasks will be placed on the technology of automatic control and remote control. But we cannot ignore the interrelationship between rocket propulsion technology, space science, and automatic control technology. The mutual promotion and cooperation of these cutting-edge sciences and technologies are the greatest driving force for promoting the rapid advancement of space navigation technology. Therefore, only the socialist Soviet Union can victoriously complete such a large-scale and comprehensive experimental work, making the Soviet Union far ahead of the United States in space navigation science, and will continue to lead the way.

    宇宙火箭和自动控制
    中国科学院自动化研究所研究员  杨家墀
    正当苏联发射世界上第一个人造地球卫星两周年的那天，也就是人类进入星际航行时代的第二年，苏联又一次成功地发射了第三个宇宙火箭，离开打中月球的第二个宇宙火箭的发射还不到一个月，在人类征服宇宙的道路上又迈进了一大步。
    在这不平凡的两年中，三个人造地球卫星和三个宇宙火箭的发射，每一次都显示着苏联的科学技术，在高、精、大三方面，都是以惊人的速度向前发展着。比较最近发射的两个宇宙火箭便能充分的说明这个飞跃的发展速度。这次发射的多级火箭上安装有自动行星际站，它的运行轨道在距离月球七千公里的地方绕过月球并继续飞行，将在10月18日由北向南从地球旁边通过。自动行星际站上安装的科学仪器更广泛的考察从地球到月球中宇宙空间的各种物理状态，从而建立星际物理的科学基础。由于它绕过月球，它能测得月球背面的情况，再传送回地球，对月球物理、天体起源等科学将作出重要的贡献。这个宇宙火箭的最后一级，不连燃料的重量是一千五百五十三公斤，比第二个宇宙火箭最后一级还重四十二公斤；因此这个多级火箭比第二个宇宙火箭要重得多，推力也要大得多，强大的火箭发动机使苏联能在任何一天发射飞往月球区域的宇宙火箭。第二个宇宙火箭上的轨道控制系统的精确度已经使西方科学家吃惊得瞠目结舌，而这次要使火箭进入绕月球运行的轨道，控制系统的精度更高了。这里想就这两次发射的宇宙火箭，来谈谈苏联在有关发射火箭的自动控制技术方面的卓越成就。
    苏联第二个和第三个宇宙火箭最杰出的成就无疑是它们的极其精确的轨道控制系统，这个控制系统操纵了火箭在整个加速段（约几分钟）的运行轨道，当最后一级火箭对地球的高度、速度和方向达到事前加以精确计算的数值时，火箭停车而进入自由飞行的轨道。苏联第二个宇宙火箭做到的控制精确度，保证火箭在加速段末端的速度误差不超过每秒一米，也就是全速的一万分之一；倾斜角度的误差不超过十分之一度。第三个宇宙火箭选择的轨道要求加速段末端的速度稍低于第二宇宙速度（约低每秒五十米），使宇宙火箭运行两个半昼夜到达月球区域。它要求加速段末端的运动参数更准确了。根据初步估算，如果要求到达月球区域的相对位置一样精确的话，加速段末段的速度还要准确四倍多。为了正确的操纵火箭在加速段的运行轨道，首先火箭上要有一个精度非常高的自动导航系统，根据本身测量的运动参数，通过火箭上带有的快速超小型计算机，自动地校正火箭的速度和方向。为了防止这个系统产生偏差，特别是加速段的最后几秒钟，很可能利用无线电在一系列事前布置的地面观测站测定火箭的位置、速度和方向，用快速电子计算机计算出它的偏差，并用遥控方法加以校正。因为宇宙火箭是多级的，每一级火箭用完后要脱离前进的火箭，后者也必须及时点火引燃，这些脱离和点火的时间也必须精密的控制，才能保证最后一级火箭接近或超过第二宇宙速度并顺利的在预定的轨道上运行。除此以外，由于月球对地球的公转，和地球的自转，预定的轨道只适于一定时间的发射，起飞的时间不能相差几秒钟。发射一个千吨以上的火箭不是一件简单的工作，必须有完善的发射系统，包括燃料的灌注、火箭的最后校验、各种仪器的校验、无线电定位和控制设备的准备、全国各观察站的联系、计算机的开始工作等；这些工作，如果没有高级自动化的设备，要及时完成，几乎是不可能的。
    在发射宇宙火箭的整个系统中，火箭本身和地面控制设备中，如果有一个元件发生故障就会影响试验的进行；甚至使试验失败。这些元件，包括的种类有电子管、半导体、继电器、小电机、以及其他控制元件。美国发射的所谓“先驱者”中有好几个失败，可能就是元件的失灵。苏联发射火箭每次成功，证明他们用的元件的可靠度，远远超过了美国。在火箭上应用的控制元件，必须能经受得起加速度和振动的考验。同时火箭上的仪器舱和自动行星际站中的温度必须加以精密的调节，也是使控制系统和科学仪器正常工作的必要条件。
    为了获得宇宙火箭整个飞行阶段中运动的完整资料，如火箭的位置、运动速度和方位角，必须用自动化的测量系统加以准确的测量。这个系统包括布置在苏联各地的测量点，火箭上高度稳定的频率为一百八十三点六兆周的无线电发射机。所有测量点必须有统一的时间基准，它们联合成一个联系系统，有效地把观测资料传输到计算中心，对测量资料不断的整理出来。这个完善的系统使苏联科学家能确定第二个宇宙火箭和月球相碰的准确时间和地点，在月球表面上测量位置的准确度在二百公里以内。
    在自动行星际站上安装有各种科学仪器，能连续的测得在运行轨道上的各种科学情报。为了保证地面接收站能准确的接收这些情报，自动行星际站必须将这些情报用磁带记录下来，由地面用无线电控制它用较快的速度发送回来。一昼夜的情报大约用二小时就能发送完毕。这个自动装置在人造地球卫星上已经使用了，但是由于自动行星际站离地球更远，要保证使用可靠，必须有更可靠的无线电收发报设备。
    各种科学实验、科学探测同生产技术一样，愈先进和尖端的技术，自动化的程度和要求就愈高。人类在向宇宙航行这个目标前进的道路上，今后在火箭重回地球、在月球上建立无人科学站和在月球上自动发射能返回地球的火箭等，都是进一步必须解决的问题。要完成这些任务，对自动控制和远距离操纵的技术将会提出更艰巨的任务。可是我们不能忽视火箭推进机技术、宇宙空间科学和自动控制技术三方面相互的关系。这些尖端科学技术的相互促进，相互协作，是推进宇宙航行技术发展快速前进最大的动力。因此，只有社会主义的苏联才能胜利地完成这样一个规模巨大的综合性的试验工作，使苏联在宇宙航行科学方面远远的领先于美国，并且将继续不断的领先。
