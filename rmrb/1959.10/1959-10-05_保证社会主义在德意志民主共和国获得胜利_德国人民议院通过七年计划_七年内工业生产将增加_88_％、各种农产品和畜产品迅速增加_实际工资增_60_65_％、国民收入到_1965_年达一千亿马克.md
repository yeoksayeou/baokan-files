Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd - At the meetings of the German Democratic Republic's People's Chamber held on September 30th and October 1st, the report on the Seven-Year Plan made by First Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht was heard and discussed, and the Law on the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the German Democratic Republic (1959-1965) and the Instructions on the Socialist Transformation of Industry were unanimously adopted.

In his report on the Seven-Year Plan made at the meeting on September 30th, Ulbricht said that the Seven-Year Plan is a program for the victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic, and the realization of this grand program will have a profound impact on consolidating peace in Europe and solving the national task of the German people. He also said that the Seven-Year Plan is a peace plan because: this plan clarifies in legal form the peaceful goals of the German Democratic Republic to promote prosperity and consolidate the people's democratic order. There are no military plans or appropriations for atomic armaments in this plan. It provides the possibility for a peaceful economic competition between the two Germanys, in order to gradually move towards the reunification of Germany and make it a peaceful and democratic country.

After elaborating on the Seven-Year Plan in detail, Ulbricht said: The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will have a very significant impact on resolving the fundamental contradiction between the imperialist rule in West Germany and the forces of peace under the leadership of the German Democratic Republic. Within a few years, the German Democratic Republic will show the superiority of socialism over the imperialist rule existing in West Germany.

In his report, Ulbricht also congratulated the People's Republic of China on its tenth anniversary. He said: "We congratulate the Chinese people on the great victories they have achieved in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party."

Speaking on international issues, Ulbricht expressed his gratitude to Khrushchev for his unremitting efforts in disarmament and understanding for the benefit of the people of all countries. He also said: Since the President of the capitalist United States can negotiate with the representative of a communist country, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, on easing international tensions and disarmament, then it should also be possible for the Prime Ministers of the two Germanys to negotiate.

Ulbricht also requested the People's Chamber on behalf of the Council of Ministers to submit proposals on disarmament, renunciation of atomic armament, etc., to the West German Federal Council.

After discussing Ulbricht's report, the People's Chamber adopted a resolution on the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament on the 1st.

The People's Chamber also passed an amendment to the 1955 law on the emblem and flag of the German Democratic Republic, which came into effect on October 1st. The new flag is divided into three colors: black, red, and gold, with the national emblem in the middle. The width of the flag is three-fifths of its length, and the length of the national emblem is one-third of the length of the flag.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd - The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic passed the "Seven-Year Plan (1959-1962) for the Development of the National Economy of the German Democratic Republic" on the 1st.

The Seven-Year Plan points out that the main tasks for the future are to maximize the scientific and technological level, labor productivity, and output of all industrial sectors, while minimizing production costs as much as possible in order to create a material and technical basis for the victory of socialism. It is necessary to surpass West Germany in labor productivity and show the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. On the basis of extensive international division of labor with socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union, those industrial and agricultural sectors with the best natural and economic conditions existing in the German Democratic Republic will be developed.

The plan stipulates that the following basic tasks must be solved before 1965:

	One. Industrial production must be accelerated—especially the power industry, the chemical industry, the electrical engineering industry, and those industrial sectors necessary for improving labor productivity and technical methods. The production of consumer goods in various industrial sectors must be accelerated. Technology and quality must quickly reach world standards. Between 1958 and 1965, industrial production will increase by 88%, and the total industrial output value must reach 110 billion marks. In the next seven years, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises will increase by 85%.

	Two. In agriculture, it is necessary to rapidly increase the output of various agricultural and livestock products on the basis of large-scale socialist production, in order to greatly increase the supply of domestically produced meat, butter, and eggs, and to improve the supply of raw materials to industry. This should create the necessary conditions for surpassing West German output.

	Three. The socialist industry must be extensively transformed in order to rapidly improve the technological level of industry. Production must be organized on the basis of the latest scientific and technological levels and the full utilization of workers' creativity.

New forms of socialist cooperation, especially socialist labor teams and socialist labor collectives, and research groups will be given the greatest encouragement.

	Four. Between 1959 and 1965, the total investment will be 142 billion marks, of which approximately 60 billion marks will be used for industry, 14 billion marks will be invested in transportation, 14 billion marks will be invested in agriculture, and approximately 30 billion marks will be invested in housing and urban construction, in order to overcome the consequences of war damage and capitalist living conditions by 1965.

By 1965, the mechanical engineering industry must produce high-quality machines with a value of at least 62 billion marks.

	Five. By rapidly increasing productivity and maximizing the reduction of production costs, the national income should increase from 63 billion marks in 1958 to 100 billion marks in 1965.

The output value of consumer goods must increase from 39.6 billion marks in 1958 to 66 billion marks in 1965—an increase of 67%. Between 1958 and 1965, the real wages of employees should increase by 60%-65%.

	Six. The education, training, and cultivation of all young people must be greatly improved and further developed.

The plan says that the total industrial output will increase by 9% to 10% annually. In the seven years, the production of means of production will increase by about 95%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by about 77%. During the Seven-Year Plan period, the output of lignite will increase by about 9 million tons annually. By 1965, the output should reach 278 million tons.

The plan says that by building new power stations and expanding existing power stations, the power generation will increase from 34.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 1958 to 63 billion kilowatt-hours in 1965. The per capita power generation will therefore increase from 2,010 kilowatt-hours in 1958 to 3,590 kilowatt-hours in 1965.

During the Seven-Year Plan period, research on the peaceful use of atomic energy will be accelerated. By 1962, the German Democratic Republic's first atomic power station will begin generating electricity.

The plan says that the rapid development of the chemical industry is a central task of the Seven-Year Plan. During this period, the state's investment in the chemical industry sector will be approximately 11 billion marks. The total output value of the chemical industry will increase to over 18 billion marks, more than double the 1958 figure. In the chemical industry, priority will be given to the development of plastics and synthetic fibers. By 1965, the production of synthetic fibers will increase to approximately six times.

The plan says that the output value of the metallurgical industry will increase from 18.3 billion marks in 1958 to 40 billion marks in 1965, with a growth rate faster than that of the entire industry. In the light industry sector, the total output of the textile industry will increase by 29% by 1961 and by 82% by 1965.

The plan says that the output value of the construction industry will increase from 5.7 billion marks in 1958 to 11.8 billion marks in 1965. Among them, residential construction will increase by 80%, agricultural construction will increase by 120%, and industrial construction will increase by 150%.

The plan points out that the domestic livestock products should gradually meet the needs of residents, and the agricultural raw materials in industry should be better supplied. The method is to systematically develop and consolidate large-scale socialist production in agriculture.

The plan stipulates that by 1965, the number of cattle will grow to 78 heads per 100 hectares of agricultural land, and 135.4 pigs. In terms of crops, the most important task is to increase yield per unit area. By 1965, the grain yield per hectare of cultivated land will reach 30.5 quintals, and the potato yield will reach 245 quintals.

The plan stipulates that the state will supply more chemical fertilizers and agricultural machinery. In the seven years, the state will supply more than 74,000 tractors and more than 26,000 various combine harvesters.

The plan stipulates that by 1965, the total value of foreign trade will increase from 1.45 billion marks in 1958 to 2.5 billion marks, and trade with socialist countries will still account for 75% of it.

The plan, when discussing the development of education, says that the state's investment in the national education system will reach 1.15 billion marks. In the seven years, the state will invest 940 million marks in higher education. The number of students in universities and colleges will increase by 37%, and the number of students in specialized schools will increase by 33%.

The plan points out that in 1961, the total retail sales of goods will expand from 39.6 billion marks in 1958 to 51 billion marks, and will be 66 billion marks in 1965. By 1965, the shortage of housing will be basically eliminated. 772,000 housing units will be built in the seven years, and the various city centers destroyed by the war will be basically rebuilt.

The Seven-Year Plan points out that the main task in the cultural field is to create a rich and diverse cultural life in cities and villages, and to encourage new works in socialist literature and art.

In this plan, the People's Chamber calls on all citizens to contribute their greatest efforts to complete the goals of the Seven-Year Plan. The People's Chamber will instruct the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic to formulate plans for political and economic tasks for each year in accordance with the Seven-Year Plan, and submit them to the People's Chamber for discussion.

    保证社会主义在德意志民主共和国获得胜利
    德国人民议院通过七年计划
    七年内工业生产将增加88％、各种农产品和畜产品迅速增加
    实际工资增60—65％、国民收入到1965年达一千亿马克
    新华社柏林3日电　在9月30日和10月1日举行的德意志民主共和国人民议院会议听取和讨论了部长会议第一副总理乌布利希所作的关于七年计划的报告，并一致通过了德意志民主共和国发展国民经济七年计划（1959—1965）法案和关于工业社会主义改建的指示。
    乌布利希9月30日在会上作的关于七年计划的报告中说，七年计划是社会主义在德意志民主共和国获得胜利的纲领，这个宏伟的纲领的实现将对巩固欧洲和平和解决德国人民的民族任务产生深刻的影响。他又说，七年计划是个和平计划，因为：这个计划用法律的形式阐明了德意志民主共和国关于促进繁荣和巩固人民民主秩序的和平目的。这个计划中没有军备计划，没有原子军备的拨款。它为两个德国展开和平经济竞赛提供了可能性，以便逐步走向重新统一德国，使之成为一个和平、民主的国家。
    在详细阐述了七年计划之后，乌布利希说：七年计划的付诸实施，将对解决西德的帝国主义统治和在德意志民主共和国领导下的和平力量之间的基本矛盾，起十分巨大的影响。在几年之内，德意志民主共和国将显示出社会主义对存在于西德的帝国主义统治的优越性。
    乌布利希在报告中还对中华人民共和国成立十周年表示祝贺。他说：“我们祝贺中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得巨大胜利。”
    在谈到国际问题时，乌布利希对赫鲁晓夫为了各国人民和平共处的利益而在裁军与谅解方面所作的不懈努力表示感谢。他还说：既然资本主义国家美国的总统，能同一个共产主义国家的代表、苏联部长会议主席就缓和国际紧张局势和裁军问题进行谈判，那么两个德国的总理也应该有可能进行谈判。
    乌布利希还代表部长会议提请人民议院向西德联邦议院提出关于裁军、放弃原子武装等方面的建议。
    在讨论了乌布利希的报告后，人民议院1日就苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军的建议通过一项决议。
    人民议院还通过了对1955年关于德意志民主共和国国徽和国旗的法律的修正案，并且于10月1日生效，新国旗分黑红黄三色，中间有国徽。国旗的宽度为长度的五分之三，国徽的长度为国旗长度的三分之一。
    新华社柏林3日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院1日通过“德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划（1959—1962）”。
    七年计划指出，今后的主要任务是最高限度地提高工业各部门的科学技术水平、劳动生产率和产量，同时尽可能地减少生产费用以便为社会主义的胜利创造物质和技术基础。必须在劳动生产率方面超过西德，并且显示社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。在和社会主义国家，特别是和苏联的广泛国际分工的基础上，将发展那些在德意志民主共和国存在着的自然和经济条件最好的工农业部门。
    计划规定，1965年之前必须解决的基本任务如下：
    一、必须加速进行工业生产——特别是电力工业、化学工业、电气技术工业以及那些为提高劳动生产率和改进技术方法所必需的工业部门。必须加速进行各工业部门的消费品生产。必须使技术和质量迅速达到世界水平。在1958—1965年之间工业生产将增加88％，必须使工业总产值达到一千一百亿马克。在今后七年中，国营工业企业的劳动生产率将增加85％。
    二、在农业方面，必须在大规模社会主义生产的基础上迅速增加各种农产品和畜产品的产量，以便大大增加本国生产的肉类、牛油和鸡蛋的供应量和改善对工业的原料供应。这应当为超过西德产量创造必要的条件。
    三、必须对社会主义工业进行广泛的改建，以便迅速提高工业的技术水平。必须在最新的科学技术水平和充分利用工人的创造才能的基础上组织生产。
    社会主义合作的新形式，特别是社会主义劳动队和社会主义劳动集体、研究小组将受到最大的鼓励。
    四、1959到1965年之间，总投资额将为一千四百二十亿马克，其中约有六百亿马克用于工业，一百四十亿马克投入交通业，一百四十亿马克投入农业，约有三百亿马克投入住宅和城市建筑，以便到1965年能克服战争破坏和资本主义生活条件所引起的后果。
    到1965年，机械工业必须至少生产产值为六百二十亿马克的高质量机器。
    五、通过迅速提高生产率和最高限度地缩减生产费用，国民收入应当从1958年的六百三十亿马克增加到1965年的一千亿马克。
    消费品的产值必须从1958年的三百九十六亿马克增加到1965年的六百六十亿马克——即增加67％。在1958—1965年之间，职工的实际工资应当增加60％—65％。
    六、必须大大改进和进一步发展全体青年的教育、训练和培养的工作。
    计划说，工业总产量每年将增加9％到10％。七年间，生产资料的生产将增加95％左右，消费品的生产增加77％左右。在七年计划期间，褐煤产量每年将增加九百万吨左右。到1965年，产量应达到二亿七千八百万吨。
    计划说，通过建设新发电站和扩建现有的发电站，发电量将由1958年的三百四十九亿度增加到1965年的六百三十亿度。按人口平均计算的发电量因此将从1958年的二千零一十度增加到1965年的三千五百九十度。
    在七年计划期间，和平利用原子能的研究工作将加快。到1962年，德意志民主共和国的第一个原子能发电站将开始发电。
    计划说，化学工业的迅速发展是七年计划的一项中心任务。在此期间，国家对化学工业部门的投资约达一百一十亿马克。化学工业的总产值将增加到一百八十亿马克以上，比1958年的数字多一倍。在化学工业中，将优先发展塑料和人造纤维。到1965年，人造纤维的产量将增加到大约六倍。
    计划说，冶金工业的产值将从1958年的一百八十三亿马克增加到1965年的四百亿马克，其增长速度比整个工业还快。在轻工业方面，到1961年纺织工业的总产量将增加29％，到1965年将增加82％。
    计划说，建筑业的产值将从1958年的五十七亿马克增加到1965年的一百一十八亿马克。其中住宅建筑将增加80％，农业建筑将增加120％，工业建筑将增加150％。
    计划指出，应该使国内的畜产品逐步做到满足居民的需要，并使工业中的农业原料获得更好的供应。办法是通过有系统地发展和巩固农业中的社会主义大型生产。
    计划规定，到1965年，牛的头数将增长到每一百公顷农业用地拥有七十八头，猪一百三十五点四头。农作物方面，最重要的任务是提高单位面积产量。到1965年，每公顷耕地谷物产量将达到三十点五公担，马铃薯产量将达到二百四十五公担。
    计划规定，国家将供应更多的化学肥料和农业机械。在七年间，国家将供应七万四千多台拖拉机，二万六千多台各种收割联合机。
    计划规定，到1965年，对外贸易额将由1958年的十四亿五千万马克增加到二十五亿马克，同社会主义国家的贸易仍将占其中的75％。
    计划在谈到教育的发展时说，国家在国民教育系统中投资将达十一亿五千万马克。七年间，国家将在高等教育方面投资九亿四千万马克。高等学校学生人数将增加37％，专科学校学生增加33％。
    计划指出，1961年，商品零售额将从1958年的三百九十六亿马克扩大到五百一十亿马克，1965年将为六百六十亿马克。到1965年，住房不足现象将基本消除。七年间将兴建住宅七十七万二千套，并将基本重建被战争破坏的各个城市中心。
    七年计划指出，文化方面的主要任务是在城市和乡村中创造丰富多采的文化生活，鼓励社会主义文艺中的新作品。
    人民议院在这个计划中号召全体公民为完成七年计划的目标而贡献出最大的力量。人民议院将责成德意志民主共和国部长会议根据七年计划制定每一年的政治经济任务的计划，并且提交人民议院讨论。
