Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 24th: The advanced collective attending the National Congress of Heroes – the Zhang Huaji Forging Group of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory – completed three and a half months’ worth of work in nine days, from October 5th to 14th, fulfilling their plan to present a gift to the National "Congress of Heroes."

The Zhang Huaji Group had a very heavy production task in October, with planned work hours exceeding actual available work hours by seven times. In order to support agricultural technological transformation and welcome the convening of the National "Congress of Heroes," the group decided to further innovate technology and complete the task ahead of schedule. Zhang Huaji and group worker Ma Chang'en jointly improved the processing method of the dust-proof felt pad for the mobile grain dryer, increasing the output of this part from thirty pieces per day by two people in the past to two thousand pieces per two hours by two people, increasing efficiency by more than 260 times. At the same time, the group workers, while ensuring quality, used material scraps to manufacture the output cylinder top plate components of the dryer, saving 140 thin steel plates. Recently, they have put forward a new goal: to continue to vigorously promote technological innovation, carry out competitions among themselves in the group, and complete seven and a half to eight months of work in one month in October.

The Zhang Huaji Group is a model for Jilin Province in continuously innovating technology and improving production efficiency. They spent three years and three months completing the workload for the first Five-Year Plan period, and one year and five months completing the workload for the second Five-Year Plan period. They are now doing work equivalent to the third quarter of 1963.

The characteristic of this group is their adherence to putting politics in command, never being satisfied with the achievements already made, and constantly revising backward indicators. Last year, they improved more than 110 items such as tool operation methods, increasing efficiency by one to twenty-seven times respectively. From January to September this year, they improved 74 kinds of dies, increasing efficiency by one to three hundred and nineteen times respectively. At present, the entire group has basically realized the mechanization of manual operations. At the same time, all workers in the group have generally mastered seven kinds of technologies: riveting, shearing, punching, pressing, forging, fitter work, and drilling, preparing conditions for comprehensive collaboration.

The deeds of the Zhang Huaji Group have greatly encouraged the workers in Siping City, where the factory is located, and the entire province. Many factory and mine workers have launched competitions to learn from them. In Siping City alone, more than 1,200 groups have participated in the competition, of which 49 groups have already completed the year's workload.

    先进集体——张化吉锻工小组
    九天完成三个半月工作量
    新华社长春24日电　吉林省出席全国群英会的先进集体——吉林省农业机械厂张化吉锻工小组，在10月5日到14日九天中，完成了三个半月的工作量，实现了他们向全国“群英会”的献礼计划。
    张化吉小组10月份的生产任务很重，计划需用工时超过实有工时七倍。为了支援农业技术改造和迎接全国“群英会”的召开，小组决定进一步革新技术，提前完成任务。张化吉和组内工人马长恩共同改进了移动式谷物烘干机防尘挡毡垫的加工方法，使这种零件由过去两人一天做三十个，增加到两人两小时做两千个，效率提高二百六十多倍。同时，小组工人在保证质量的前提下，利用料边制造烘干机的输出筒顶板部件，节省了一百四十张薄钢板。最近，他们又提出了新的奋斗目标：继续大闹技术革新，组内相互开展对手赛，在10月份一个月完成七个半月到八个月的工作量。
    张化吉小组是吉林省的不断革新技术提高生产效率的标兵。他们曾用三年零三个月的时间完成了第一个五年计划期间的工作量，用一年零五个月的时间完成了第二个五年计划期间的工作量，现在正在做相当于1963年第三季度的工作。
    这个小组的特点是坚持政治挂帅，永不满足已经取得的成绩，不断修订落后指标。去年他们改进工具操作方法等一百一十多项，分别提高效率一至二十七倍。今年1到9月又改进了七十四种胎具，分别提高效率一至三百十九倍。目前全组已把手工操作基本上实现了机械化。同时，全组工人普遍掌握了铆、剪、冲、压、锻、钳、钻七种技术，为全面协作准备了条件。
    张化吉小组的事迹，对工厂所在的四平市和全省职工鼓舞很大，许多厂矿职工都展开向他们学习的竞赛。仅四平市就有一千二百多个小组参加了竞赛，其中有四十九个小组已经完成全年的工作量。
