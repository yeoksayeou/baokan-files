Taking the First Step Well
By Staff Commentator

The ancients said: The key to a year lies in spring. This means that spring is the season that determines the success or failure of the entire year's plan. The person who said this would be considered prescient in ancient times. However, in this era of the Great Leap Forward, it is not entirely appropriate to act according to this saying. This is because the time that determines the success or failure of the entire year's production (especially agricultural production) is no longer just the spring of the year, but the previous winter. Last year's Great Leap Forward began with large-scale farmland water conservancy and deep plowing of the land in the autumn and winter of the previous year. To realize next year's Great Leap Forward, we must also do a good job in this year's autumn plowing and planting and winter production, strive to win a bumper summer harvest next year, and fight the first battle of the 1960 agricultural production Great Leap Forward.

Now, in the rural areas of the country, after the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a magnificent mass production upsurge has emerged. The vast number of commune members are full of energy and are not only determined to ensure this year's bumper harvest but also shouted the resounding slogan of continuing the Great Leap Forward to strive for a greater agricultural harvest next year. This is very encouraging.

In the face of this excellent situation, how leaders at all levels can stand at the forefront of the mass movement, which is rising wave upon wave, and strengthen leadership is a very important issue on the agricultural front at present. The Yangzhou Prefectural Party Committee has precisely recognized this situation and made a determination to guide the current autumn planting work with a revolutionary spirit. The so-called revolutionary spirit is the spirit of breaking with conventions and continuous leaps forward.

Last year's and this year's bumper harvests have prepared conditions in all aspects for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. For example, we have the People's Commune, such an advanced social organization with strong vitality, the ideological awareness of the masses has been greatly improved, the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture is more experienced, and more production funds have been continuously prepared for next year's bumper harvest... and so on. If we make full use of these favorable conditions, boost our energy, and speed up our pace, we will surely achieve greater success in the new year. To achieve a greater harvest next year, this means that in leadership thinking, we must not only see the summer harvest but also the autumn harvest; we must not only focus on grain, cotton, and oil but also on diversified operations and basic farmland construction. People must be far-sighted, make plans early, strive to be proactive, seize the opportunity, seize the main links, and drive the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production.

The comrades of the Yangzhou Prefectural Party Committee have such a clear guiding ideology and revolutionary spirit and have adopted an active and offensive fighting posture. They seized autumn planting as the beginning of next year's Great Leap Forward, made overall plans, and solved a series of issues related to next year's Great Leap Forward without delay. These issues in the Yangzhou Prefecture are: further changing the farming system, not only to expand the wheat area but also to increase the area of rapeseed and green manure; not only to strive for a bumper harvest in the upper crop but also to ensure increased production in the lower crop; basic farmland construction and water conservancy facilities must be adapted to the needs of wheat winter and spring irrigation, fertilization methods must be adapted to the needs of high yield, the level of cultivation and tools must be adapted to the requirements of high-speed development of production, and the preparation of production funds, etc.

In solving these key issues, the leading cadres of the Yangzhou Prefectural Party Committee went deep into the masses, summarized various types of advanced experiences, and established advanced banners in all aspects, such as the reform of the farming system and the rational arrangement of stubble in Taizhou, water conservancy construction in Gaoyou, sideline production in Baoying, and tool reform in Jiangdu. These advanced models, after the on-site promotion by the Yangzhou Prefectural Party Committee, suddenly turned into huge material forces. Cadres and masses in various places have concrete and feasible living experiences, further liberated their minds, recognized the situation, and are determined to work hard for next year's Great Leap Forward. A lively and vigorous situation of vigorous development and striving for the upstream has emerged throughout the region. Various competitions have been launched, promoting and supporting each other. The autumn sowing area this year will be expanded by 34.8% compared with last year, and new leaps forward have also been made in diversified operations, basic farmland construction, and tool reform.

Of course, from the perspective of the entire Great Leap Forward next year, the comrades in the Yangzhou area have only just taken the first step. However, this first step is very correct and very important. To win next year's bumper harvest, we must continue to make unremitting efforts. Other places should also seize the great opportunity, be good at mastering the ideological weapon of continuing the Great Leap Forward, and be good at using various favorable conditions to promote the continued Great Leap Forward in their regions in many ways.

    走好了头一步
     本报评论员
    古人说：一年之计在于春。这意思是说，春天是决定全年成败大计的季节。说这话的人，在古代要算是有预见性的了。但在这大跃进的年代里，如果还是按这句话办事，就不完全妥当。因为，现在决定全年生产（特别是农业生产）成败大计的时机已经不尽是当年的春天，而是在前冬了。去年的大跃进，就是从前年秋冬大搞农田水利和深翻土地开始的。要实现明年的大跃进，同样必须做好今年的秋耕秋种和冬季生产，奋力夺取明年夏季大丰收，打好1960年农业生产大跃进的第一仗。
    现在，在全国农村中，经过党的八届八中全会决议的贯彻，一个波澜壮阔的群众性的生产新高潮已经出现了。广大社员干劲冲天，不仅要确保今年的大丰收，而且喊出了继续大跃进争取明年农业更大丰收的响亮口号。这是十分令人鼓舞的。
    在这大好形势前面，各级领导如何站到一浪赶一浪、一浪高一浪的群众运动的前面，加强领导，是当前农业战线上一个很重要的问题。扬州地委正是认清了这种局势，下了决心，用革命精神来指导当前的秋种工作。所谓革命精神，就是打破常规、不断跃进的精神。
    去年和今年的大丰收，已经为明年的继续大跃进准备了各方面的条件。例如我们有了人民公社这样先进的有强大生命力的社会组织，群众的思想觉悟大大提高，农业八字宪法的贯彻更有经验，连续为明年的大丰收准备了更多的生产资金……等等。充分运用这些有利条件，鼓足干劲，加快步伐，就一定会在新的一年取得更大的成就。要取得明年更大丰收，这就是说，在领导思想上，不仅要看到夏收，而且要看到秋收；不仅要抓粮棉油，而且要抓多种经营和农田基本建设。人们必须高瞻远瞩，早作规划，力求主动，抓紧时机，抓紧主要环节，带动农业生产的全面跃进。
    扬州地委的同志就有这样明确的指导思想和革命气魄，并且采取了积极进攻的战斗姿态。他们抓住秋种作为明年大跃进的开始，通盘进行规划，不失时机地解决了一系列有关明年大跃进的问题。这些问题在扬州专区来说就是：进一步改变耕作制度，既要扩大麦子面积，又要增加油菜、绿肥面积；既要争取上熟丰收，又要保证下熟增产；农田基本建设、水利设施要与麦子冬春灌溉的需要适应，施肥方法要与高产需要相适应，耕作水平、工具要与高速度发展生产的要求相适应，还有生产资金的准备等等。
    在解决这些关键问题时，扬州地委的领导干部深入群众，总结了各种类型的先进经验，树立了各方面的先进旗帜，例如泰州的改革耕作制度和合理安排茬口、高邮的水利建设、宝应的副业生产、江都的工具改革等。这些先进的标兵，经过扬州地委的现场促进，顿时变成巨大的物质力量。各地干部和群众有了具体可行的活的经验，进一步解放了思想，认清了形势，决心为明年大跃进大干一场。全区出现了轰轰烈烈、齐争上游的生动活泼的局面，各种各样的竞赛开展起来了，互相促进，互相支援。今年秋播面积将比去年扩大34.8％，多种经营、农田基本建设和工具改革也有了新的跃进。
    当然，从明年整个大跃进的里程来看，扬州地区的同志还不过刚刚跨出了第一步。但是，这第一步跨得很对，跨得很重要。要赢得明年的大丰收，还要继续作不懈的努力。其他地方也要抓紧大好时机，善于掌握继续大跃进的思想武器，善于运用各种有利条件，从多方面来促进本地区的继续大跃进。
