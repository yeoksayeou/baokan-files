The Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Call for Redoubled Efforts to Deepen the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, Seize the Excellent Situation to Achieve a Comprehensive Great Leap Forward

(Our Newspaper) The Hubei Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged provincial party committee meeting from August 25th to September 15th. The meeting fully endorsed the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, calling on the vast number of cadres in the province to reject right-leaning thoughts, boost morale, deeply mobilize the masses, and set off a new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement, striving to complete and overfulfill the Great Leap Forward plan for 1959 and prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward next year.

After a detailed summary of the work since 1958, the meeting believed that under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, 1958 was a year of Great Leap Forward for Hubei Province. Compared with 1957, the total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 43%, grain increased by 11.6%, and cotton increased by 960,000 dan (1 dan = 50 kg). The rural areas of the province realized the people's commune system, creating favorable conditions for better development of production. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Great Leap Forward continued in the first half of this year. The total industrial output value increased by 76.83% compared with the same period last year, of which steel increased by 185.3% and iron increased seventeen times (excluding native steel and native iron). Although agricultural production suffered from severe drought, thanks to the tremendous superiority of the people's communes, a bumper harvest was still achieved. All these ironclad facts thoroughly shattered the shameless slanders of the right-leaning opportunists against the Great Leap Forward in Hubei Province. However, in June and July, some cadres in Hubei Province developed right-leaning thoughts. In their actual work, instead of boosting morale, striving for advancement, overcoming difficulties, and forging ahead bravely, they wavered and surrendered in the face of difficulties, believing that the lower the production targets, the better. At the same time, a small number of right-leaning opportunists also took the opportunity to launch vicious attacks on the people's communes, the General Line, and the leadership of the Party. They spread pessimistic sentiments everywhere, discouraged the masses, and loosened their efforts. Therefore, the production situation in many enterprises was not good in June and July. The meeting pointed out that the Party's General Line is like a lighthouse. Following it leads to greater enthusiasm, fewer difficulties, and more victories. Departing from it leads to less enthusiasm, more difficulties, and inevitable mistakes. Resisting the attacks of right-leaning opportunism and opposing right-leaning thoughts, defending the Party's General Line, is the most urgent political task for the entire Party and the vast number of people in Hubei Province, and it is also the basic key to continuing to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement.

Since the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was transmitted to Hubei, the vast number of cadres and the masses in the province have redoubled their efforts, their fighting spirit has been high, and a new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement has been set off, with production rising steadily. The meeting pointed out that although great achievements have been made in the anti-rightist, morale-boosting, and increase production and practice economy movement, it must be recognized that this is only the beginning. A large part of the industrial production plan still needs to be completed, agriculture must strive for an all-round bumper harvest, and commercial departments must do a good job in purchasing and supplying means of production and means of livelihood, making arrangements for the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's livelihood. The transportation tasks after the autumn harvest are particularly heavy and must be done well. At the same time, preparations must be made for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960. All this requires cadres and the masses to work hard, diligently, and cleverly. The meeting believed that these tasks are arduous, but it is possible and should be completed and overfulfilled. The key lies in deepening the struggle against right-leaning thoughts and boosting morale, and adhering to the Party's General Line for socialist construction. The meeting called for launching a large-scale General Line and socialist education movement among the Party organizations and the vast number of masses throughout the province, adopting mass line methods such as recalling comparisons, reasoning accounts, big blooming, big contending, big character posters, big debates, visits and evaluations, and on-site meetings, to draw a clear line between two roads (the socialist road and the capitalist road), two lines (the Party's General Line for socialist construction and the right-leaning opportunist line), and two ideologies (capitalist ideology and socialist ideology). Vigorously publicize the Party's General Line for socialist construction, publicize the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, help the vast number of masses learn to calculate carefully and live a good life, commend good people and good deeds, especially commend the activists who adhere to the General Line, love the people's communes, and have contributed to the Great Leap Forward. Right-leaning thoughts must be exposed and criticized in a realistic manner. In carrying out the General Line and socialist education, it is necessary to promptly expose and smash the sabotage activities of various reactionary elements, punish saboteurs, establish righteousness, eliminate evil, insert red flags, establish pacesetters, boost morale, create an upsurge, combine rectification with production, and use the General Line and socialist education as a driving force to promote a high tide of production and construction.

The meeting believed that the current situation is very good, and the future will be even better, with more and more favorable conditions and greater and greater enthusiasm of the masses. As long as we hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, advance victoriously along the direction pointed out by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we will surely be able to complete and overfulfill this year's increase production and practice economy plan and prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960.

(Our Newspaper) The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee held its First Eighth Plenary Session on September 13th, studying and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The comrades present at the meeting believed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party had far-reaching historical significance and great practical political significance, and unanimously expressed their firm support. The meeting made a resolution on resolutely implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, safeguarding the Party's General Line with practical actions, and striving to complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks ahead of schedule.

The plenary session of the provincial party committee pointed out with full confidence: The province's production and construction are just as estimated by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and the situation is very good. Since the beginning of this year, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, all fronts in the province have continued to leap forward. From January to August this year, compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value increased by 29.7%, steel increased by 2.7 times, and coal increased by 1.2 times. The people's communes, after rectification, are more sound and consolidated, and are increasingly showing their superiority. All aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have developed better than last year. On the transportation front, the volume of transportation has risen month by month, with the freight volume of trains and automobiles increasing by 45%, and fiscal revenue increasing by 20%. The total value of procurement of agricultural and sideline products and the retail sales of commodities each increased by 14%. After the promulgation of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, it stimulated the even higher labor enthusiasm of the people of the province, and production rose sharply. All this further proves the great wisdom and complete correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and proves the great power of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. It is completely believable that as long as we unswervingly advance bravely along the glorious road pointed out by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year.

The plenary session of the provincial party committee called on the Party members and people of the province to continue to safeguard the Party's General Line with practical actions and immediately push the increase production and practice economy movement, which has already been carried out vigorously, to a new upsurge.

The resolution passed by the plenary session of the provincial party committee said that the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a new great driving force, and new achievements, new records, and good news of completing plans ahead of schedule are constantly coming from all directions on various production fronts. Facts powerfully show that as long as we have full enthusiasm, lofty aspirations to strive for advancement, the courage to overcome difficulties, and properly carry out organizational work, we can not only complete this year's plan, but also greatly overproduce, and even strive for particularly large overproduction. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with generally completing and overfulfilling the plan, and we must not "sit in a well and watch the sky," and be complacent with a little achievement. We must recognize that completing and overfulfilling the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year is not only a major economic task, but also a major political task. On the industrial front, we must do everything possible to strive to greatly advance and greatly overfulfill this year's production plan, especially to seize the production of steel, iron, steel, coal, electricity, and complete sets of machinery and equipment urgently needed this year; county and commune industries must actively develop under the premise of serving agricultural production as the center; basic construction departments must ensure the timely completion and timely commissioning of key projects. On the agricultural front, we must concentrate our efforts, strengthen leadership, carry out a vigorous mass movement, complete the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks with equal emphasis on quantity and quality, do everything possible to reduce scattering, strive for more harvests, resolutely implement the small spring revolution, implement the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvests with large-area high yields, and at the same time actively prepare for winter large-scale water conservancy and farmland basic construction, as well as carrying out the winter production movement. On the transportation front, we must vigorously tap transportation potential, give full play to the transportation efficiency of all vehicles, effectively save gasoline and tires, organize civilian transportation forces, and launch a mass short-distance transportation movement after the autumn harvest to meet the needs of production and construction development. On the commercial front, we must strengthen the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and actively organize the storage of autumn grain, strengthen and improve commodity supply and the leadership and management of rural markets. On all fronts and in all departments, we must implement the principle of "building the country with diligence and thrift, managing households with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift," and earnestly practice thrift. Vigorously save raw materials, fuel, electricity, and all expenses that can be reduced. From the time when autumn grain comes on the market, we must earnestly grasp the saving of grain and planned use of grain, so that the idea of "living a rich life as if it were a poor life" is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and becomes the conscious action of the masses. For consumer goods that are currently not abundant in supply, in addition to actively organizing production, we should also advocate saving among all the people and overcome waste. This winter and next spring, we must carry out a large-scale ideological education movement of patriotism, socialism, and communism among the people of the province, extensively and deeply publicize the superiority of the General Line for socialist construction and the socialist system, in order to further improve the socialist awareness of the masses and lay a good ideological foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward.

The resolution believes that the next few months are the key to striving to complete and overfulfill the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule. We must seize the current favorable situation, seize this precious opportunity, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and make the increase production and practice economy movement rise higher and higher.

    湖北省委、云南省委号召鼓足干劲深入开展增产节约运动
    抓紧大好形势实现全面大跃进
    本报讯　中共湖北省委在8月25日到9月15日举行了省委扩大会
  议。会议完全拥护党的八届八中全会决议，号召全省广大干部反掉右倾思想，大鼓干劲，深入发动群众，掀起增产节约新高潮，争取完成和超额完成1959年的大跃进计划，并为明年的继续大跃进作好准备。
    会议详细总结了1958年以来的工作后认为：在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年是湖北省大跃进的一年。同1957年相比，1958年工业生产总值增长了43％，粮食增长了11.6％，棉花增长了九十六万担。全省农村实现了人民公社化，为更好地发展生产创造了良好条件。在1958年大跃进的基础上，今年上半年又继续实现了大跃进。工业总产值比去年同期增长了76.83％，其中钢增长了185.3％，铁增长了十七倍（不包括土钢土铁）。农业生产虽然遭到严重的干旱，但是由于人民公社发挥了巨大的优越性，仍旧获得了丰收。这一切铁的事实彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对湖北省大跃进的无耻污蔑。但是，在6、7月份，湖北省有部分干部产生了右倾思想。他们在实际工作中，不是鼓足干劲，力争上游，克服困难，奋勇前进，而是在困难面前动摇投降，认为生产指标越低越好。同时，少数右倾机会主义分子也趁机向人民公社、向总路线和党的领导展开了恶毒的进攻。他们到处散布悲观情绪，泄群的气，松群众的劲。因此，6、7月份不少企业生产情况不好。会议指出，党的总路线像灯塔一样，跟着她走干劲就大，困难就少，胜利就多，离开了她，干劲就小，困难就多，就一定犯错误。打退右倾机会主义的进攻和反对右倾思想，保卫党的总路线，是当前湖北省全党和广大人民最迫切的政治任务，也是继续深入开展增产节约运动的基本关键。
    自从党的八届八中全会的精神传到湖北以后，全省广大干部和群众干劲倍增，斗志昂扬，掀起了新的增产节约高潮，生产节节上升。会议指出，反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动虽然已经获得了很大成绩，但是必须看到这还仅仅是开始。工业生产计划还有很大一部分要继续完成，农业要争取全面丰收，商业部门要做好生产资料和生活资料的收购和供应工作，为工农业生产大跃进和人民生活做好安排，秋收后交通运输任务特别繁重，必须做好，同时要为1960年继续大跃进做好准备。这一切都要求干部和群众大干苦干巧干。会议认为，这些任务是繁重的，但是有可能也应该完成和超额完成。关键就在于深入开展反右倾鼓干劲的斗争，坚持党的社会主义建设总路线。会议要求在全省党组织和广大群众中，开展一个大规模的总路线和社会主义教育运动，采取回忆对比、说理算账、大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、参观评比、现场会议等群众路线的方法，划清两条道路（社会主义道路和资本主义道路）、两条路线（党的社会主义建设总路线和右倾机会主义路线）和两种思想（资本主义思想和社会主义思想）的界限。大张旗鼓地宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，宣传大跃进和人民公社的成就，帮助广大群众学会精打细算过好日子，表扬好人好事，特别是表扬坚持总路线、热爱人民公社、在大跃进中有贡献的积极分子。对右倾思想必须加以实事求是的揭发和批判。在进行总路线和社会主义教育中，要及时揭发和粉碎各种反动分子的破坏活动。惩办破坏分子，树立正气，肃清邪气，插红旗，树标兵，鼓干劲，搞高潮，把整风和生产结合起来，以总路线和社会主义教育为动力，推动生产建设高潮。
    会议认为，目前形势很好，今后会更好，有利条件越来越多，群众的干劲越来越大。只要高举党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗，沿着党的八届八中全会指出的方向，乘胜前进，就一定能完成和超额完成今年的增产节约计划，并且为1960年的继续大跃进做好准备。

    本报讯　中共云南省委于9月13日举行了第一届第八次全体会议，学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会的决议。到会同志都认为党的八届八中全会具有深远的历史意义和伟大的现实政治意义，一致表示坚决拥护。会议作出了关于坚决执行党的八届八中全会决议，以实际行动保卫党的总路线，力争提前和超额完成今年生产任务的决议。
    省委全体会议满怀信心地指出：全省的生产建设正像八届八中全会所估计的，情况十分良好。今年以来，在去年大跃进的基础上，全省各个战线继续跃进。今年1至8月份与去年同期对比，工业总产值增长了29.7％，钢增长了二点七倍，煤增长了一点二倍。人民公社经过整顿，更加健全巩固，正日益显著地发挥出它的优越性，农林牧副渔各个方面比去年都有了更好的发展。在交通运输战线上，运输量逐月上升，火车和汽车的货运量增长了45％，财政收入增长20％。农副产品的采购总值和商品零售额各增长了14％。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，激发了全省人民更加高涨的劳动热情，生产猛烈上升。这一切都更加证明了党中央和毛主席领导的伟大英明和完全正确，证明了党的社会主义建设总路线具有巨大威力。完全可以相信，只要毫不动摇地沿着党的八届八中全会指出的光荣道路勇往直前，就一定能够在今年内提前和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    省委全体会议号召全省的党员和人民群众，继续以实际行动，保卫党的总路线，立即把已经轰轰烈烈开展起来的增产节约运动推向新的高涨。
    省委全体会议通过的决议中说，党的八届八中全会的号召是一个新的伟大的动力，各个生产战线上新的成就、新的纪录和提前完成计划的捷报，从四面八方不断传来。事实有力地表明了：只要我们有十足的干劲，力争上游的大志，战胜困难的气魄，并且妥善地进行组织工作，就不但可以完成今年的计划，而且可以大大超产，甚至可以争取特大超产。因此，决不能满足于一般地完成和超额完成计划，更不能“坐井观天”，稍有成绩即沾沾自喜。必须认识到，在今年内提前和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，不仅是一个重大的经济任务，也是一个重大的政治任务。在工业战线上，必须千方百计力争大大提前和大大超额完成今年的生产计划，特别是要抓紧钢、铁、钢材、煤炭、电力和今年急需的成套机械设备的生产；县、社工业必须在以为农业生产服务为中心的前提下，积极发展；基本建设部门，必须保证重点工程项目的如期完成和如期投入生产。在农业战线上，必须集中力量，加强领导，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，量质并重地完成秋收秋种任务，尽一切努力减少抛撒，力争多收，坚决实行小春大革命，贯彻执行多种多收和大面积高产相结合的方针，同时积极准备冬季大修水利和农田基本建设，以及开展冬季生产运动。在交通战线上，必须大力挖掘运输潜力，充分发挥一切车辆的运输效率，切实节约汽油和轮胎，组织好民间运输力量，在秋收后开展一个群众性的短途运输运动，以适应生产和建设发展的需要。在商业战线上，必须加强农副业产品的采购和积极组织秋粮入库，加强和改进商品供应、农村市场的领导管理。在一切战线上，一切部门，都必须贯彻执行“勤俭建国，勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业”的方针，认真厉行节约。大力节约原材料、燃料、电力，以及一切可以节减的开支。从秋粮登场的时候起，就要切实抓紧节约用粮和计划用粮，使“富日子当穷日子过”的思想深入人心，并且成为群众的自觉行动。对于目前某些供应还不算富裕的消费品，除积极组织生产外，还应当在全体人民中提倡节省，克服浪费。今冬明春，要在全省人民中开展一次大规模的爱国主义、社会主义和共产主义的思想教育运动，广泛深入地宣传社会主义建设总路线和社会主义制度的优越性，以进一步提高群众的社会主义觉悟，为继续大跃进打好思想基础。
    决议认为，今后几个月，是争取提前和超额完成第二个五年计划主要指标的关键，必须抓紧当前的有利形势，抓紧这个珍贵的时机，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，使增产节约运动一浪比一浪高。
