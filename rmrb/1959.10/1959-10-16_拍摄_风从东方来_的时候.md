　　While Filming "The East is Red"
　　Gan Xuewei
    A few days ago, I watched "The East is Red" again with the audience. When I heard the audience's laughter, when I heard the people around me reacting to certain plots and scenes in the film... my heart was truly filled with gratitude. Our audience, they are so sensitive, and so strict and fair. At the same time, every shot cannot help but remind me of those exciting, tense, and unforgettable days working with Ye. Jigan, Va. Kashnikov, A. Gorchad, Yu. Teberstein, and all the comrades in the Chinese and Soviet film crews.
    "The East is Red" is an epic film full of revolutionary romanticism. The style of the film may not often be noticed by the audience, but from a creative point of view, it has important significance for our work. The epic style of the film, generally speaking, does not only express the fate and psychology of a certain individual protagonist, it requires the expression of the movement of the masses in huge historical events, it requires the expression of the rich and varied life of the masses and the shaping of a heroic group portrait of the people... The main reason why we chose this style is that the subject matter and theme we are trying to express demand that it be expressed in an epic style. What we are depicting is the immortal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, a friendship built on the basis of internationalist thought. At the same time, we chose to express this theme through the Chinese people's initial socialist construction, the struggle between man and nature, and the march towards nature. To express such a theme in this style, of course, requires magnificent scenes in the visual treatment of the film.
    I remember when we were shooting the scene of "human wall" in the film, we built a temporary dam set of hundreds of meters long on the river beach three times, and all three times it was washed away by the flood. However, we built this set for the fourth time and finally filmed this scene. This not only involved the labor of many workers and engineering soldiers from the Xin'an River Hydropower Engineering Bureau, but also Ye. Jigan and A. Gorchad, who were about sixty years old, and the Soviet actor Goki, who was over fifty years old, were with us, along with thousands of soldiers and workers, braving the artificial wind and rain, and jumping into the icy river to film the scene again and again. The Soviet chief photographer, A. Gorchad, immersed his whole body in the cold water to shoot certain shots of this scene. His expression when he was lying on the camera and the serious creative attitude of the Soviet actor Goki in performing in the cold water left a deep impression on the hearts of many Chinese comrades.
    In order to shoot certain night scenes and the image of the flood, we used to set off before dawn and not return until the moon began to rise. To make use of the light when the sun was about to rise and had just set, all the comrades in the film crew had done so much preparation. In order to shoot the scene of the Dragon King Temple being flooded, dozens of set construction workers worked day and night in three shifts in the knee-deep river water and rain to rush to build the set. Such examples not only happened in China, but also when working at the Moscow studio. In order to complete the entire production of the film before our National Day and make it a gift for the National Day, the Moscow Film Studio prepared ample working conditions for us in all our post-production work, working up to sixteen hours a day. In particular, the contributions made by the respected Ye. Jigan in the writing and shooting of this film made me think of him all the time. From the beginning of brewing the script creation in October 1957 to the completion of the film in mid-September this year, every stage has his outstanding labor. What is particularly unforgettable to me is that during the filming stage in China, in addition to working with everyone every day during the actual shooting, he often prepared for the work of the next day or the next stage, or discussed and arranged with us, or worked alone. For a long time, he worked almost fourteen hours a day or even more than fourteen hours. Often after midnight, I could still hear the "da da" sound of the typewriter from his room. The next morning, he had to set off with everyone to shoot on location. I remember when we first met, I told him that in order to work with him, I had watched his films – "Prelude to Revolution" and "We Are From Kronstadt" – four times. He said, "The most important thing in creation is friendship." The facts of the past two years have proved this sentence. Our friendship is built on common beliefs, and it has developed and been consolidated by overcoming a series of difficulties in our work. I think if there are still inconsistencies in style in "The East is Red," it is because we have had ample opportunities for contact and understanding over the past two years.
    The process of collaboration on "The East is Red" is a very precious and memorable page for the comrades of our Chinese film crew. It will remain in our hearts and be unforgettable forever. (Attached picture)

　　拍摄“风从东方来”的时候
　　干学伟
    前几天，我又一次同观众一起看了“风从东方来”。当我听到观众的欢笑时，当我听到周围的人们为影片中某些情节和场面而发出各种反应时……我心里真充满了十分感激的心情。我们的观众，他们是这样的敏感，又这样的严格、公允。同时，从每一个镜头中都不能不使我想到那些同叶·吉甘、瓦·卡什夫尼柯夫、阿·哥尔查德、尤·捷别尔斯坦以及中苏两国的摄制组全体同志们共同工作的日子，那一些使人兴奋、紧张、难忘的日子。
    “风从东方来”是一部富于革命浪漫主义色彩的史诗样式的影片。影片的样式，对于观众来说也许并不常常被注意，可是，从创作的角度来说，它却对我们的工作有着重要的意义。影片的史诗样式，一般说来，它并不是只表现某个个别主人翁的命运心理等等，它要求表现巨大的历史事件中人民群众的运动，它要求表现群众的丰富多采的生活和塑造出人民群众的英雄群像来……。我们之所以选择这种样式，主要是我们所企图表现的题材和主题思想本身要求用史诗样式来表现它。我们所描绘的是不朽的中苏人民之间的友谊，这种友谊又是在国际主义思想基础上建立起来的。同时，我们又选择了通过中国人民在社会主义建设初期、人与自然的搏斗、向自然进军来表现这样一个主题的。用这种样式来表现这样的主题当然就一定要求影片的造型处理方面具有宏伟的场景。
    记得当我们拍摄影片中“人墙”这一场戏的时候，三次在河滩上搭起一百几十米长的临时坝布景，三次都为洪汛所冲垮。可是，我们第四次又搭起了这个景，终于拍成了这场戏。这里，不仅有新安江水电工程局的许许多多工人同志们以及工兵同志们的劳动，而且，拍摄这场戏的时候，有六十岁左右高龄的叶·吉甘和阿·哥尔查德和五十多岁的苏联演员戈基同志等也同我们几千名战士和工人在一起，冒着人造的疾风暴雨，一次又一次地跳入冰凉的江水中进行了拍摄。苏联总摄影师阿·哥尔查德为拍摄这场戏的某些镜头，全身都泡在凉水中，他伏在摄影机上的神情以及苏联演员戈基在凉水中表演的严肃的创作态度，在很多中国同志心中留下了深刻的印象。
    为了拍摄某些夜景以及洪水的形象，我们曾经在天明以前就出发，一直到月亮开始上升才能回来。为了利用太阳将出未出以及太阳刚刚下山的光线，全体摄制组同志们曾经做了多少准备工作。为了拍摄水淹龙王庙这个景，几十个制景工人夜以继日地分为三班在没膝盖的江水中、风雨中赶制了布景。这样的事例不只发生在中国，在莫斯科厂工作时，也是如此。为了赶在我国国庆节前完成影片的全部制作工作，使它成为国庆节的献礼片，莫斯科电影制片厂在我们全部后期工作中为我们准备了充分的工作条件，每天工作达十六小时之多。尤其是敬爱的叶·吉甘在这部影片的剧作和拍摄中所做出的贡献更让我时时想起。从1957年10月开始酝酿剧本创作，一直到今年9月中旬影片完成，近两年的工作中，每一个阶段都有着他的卓越的劳动，特别使我难以忘记的是在中国拍摄阶段，除了每天实拍的时候，他同大家一起工作之外，他还经常地为了第二天或下一个阶段的工作作准备，或者同我们一起商量、布置，或者单独进行工作，很长的时间当中，他几乎每天都工作十四小时甚至超过十四小时，常常在子夜以后，我还听到从他房里传出打字机的“哒哒”声音。第二天一早却要同大家一起出发拍摄外景。我想起在我们初次见面的时候，我曾经告诉他，为了同他共同工作，我曾经看过四遍他所导演的影片——“革命的前奏”和“我们来自克琅施塔德”。他说：“在创作中最重要的是友谊。”两年来的事实证明了这句话。我们之间的友谊是在共同的信念上建立起来的，又由于在工作当中克服了一系列的困难而发展和巩固了起来。我认为，假如在“风从东方来”这部影片中还看不到在样式上风格上有不统一的地方的话，那就是由于在两年当中，我们之间有了充分的接触和理解的机会。
    “风从东方来”的合作过程，对于我们中国摄制组的同志们说来，是十分珍贵和值得纪念的一页，它将留在我们的心坎里永志不忘。（附图片）
