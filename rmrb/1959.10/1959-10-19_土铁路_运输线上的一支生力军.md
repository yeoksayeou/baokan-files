　　An Emerging Force on the Native Railroad Transportation Line

　　Our province's native railroads were born under the great leap forward situation of industrial and agricultural production and are the product of implementing the "combining foreign and native methods" and "walking on two legs" policies in transportation construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the rapid development of the steel, iron, and coal industries, as well as the diversified economy of the people's communes, transportation tasks have become increasingly heavy, especially short-distance transportation tasks. In order to strengthen short-distance transportation and adapt to the requirements of the objective situation, the transportation departments of the party committees at all levels in our province have implemented the policy determined by the provincial party committee of simultaneously tapping potential and increasing equipment. They have vigorously carried out mass movements, built vehicles and boats on a large scale, and attached great importance to the pioneering work of the Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County in self-repairing simple native railroads. They affirmed that the construction of native railroads is a reliable way to solve short-distance transportation in concentrated areas of coal, iron ore, and materials. A site meeting was specially convened to promote the experience of Huaiyuan County. Furthermore, taking full advantage of the favorable material conditions of our province's small blast furnaces producing a large amount of pig iron, the masses were mobilized to overcome numerous difficulties. With the help of the Railway Bureau, many technical problems such as casting rails, manufacturing vehicles, and paving roads were solved in every possible way. In the short span of half a year from April to the present, eight native railroads have been built. These native railroads are operating well, with a daily transportation capacity of more than 6,300 tons, adding a new force to the transportation front.

　　Native railroads have great potential. It should be said definitively now. However, some people used to hold skeptical attitudes or mysterious views about the construction of native railroads. They were superstitious about "foreign railroads" and doubted whether native railroads could be built successfully, and whether they could solve the problem even if they were successful. They emphasized difficult conditions such as materials, equipment, and technology, and were slow to take action, or hesitated and waited to see what others would achieve first. Now, they have seen the fact that native railroads have been successfully built, and they have seen the power of native railroads in short-distance transportation. Therefore, their doubts have been greatly dispelled, and their enthusiasm for building native railroads has been greatly increased. The eight native railroads that have been built and opened to traffic fully demonstrate the advantages of low investment, low cost, large transportation capacity, fast construction, materials that are easy to solve locally, and construction wherever needed. According to calculations by relevant departments, the line cost alone for building one kilometer of foreign railroad averages more than 300,000 yuan; while building one kilometer of native railroad, including locomotives and vehicles (excluding bridges), only costs more than 150,000 yuan. The investment is reduced by nearly half. The material and technical requirements for repairing foreign railways are very high. At present, the country's production of steel rails, locomotives and vehicles cannot fully meet the needs, and factory and mining branch lines cannot be built in large quantities in a short period of time; while native railways can be simple and crude, use local materials, and be built in large quantities. Repairing foreign railways is not cost-effective for some small coal mines and small iron mines with small reserves. The production volume of small mines is small, and the transportation capacity of foreign railways cannot be fully utilized; it is costly to transport coal and ore by manpower, flatbed trucks, and automobiles, and it occupies a lot of labor; it is more economical and cost-effective to repair native railways. Native railways have a large transportation volume and save labor, and the freight is low and unaffected by wind or rain. This is also something that cars and flatbed trucks cannot do. Here is an account: The freight for coal is 22 cents per ton-kilometer by car, one yuan per ton-kilometer by flatbed truck, and the cost of a native railroad is only five cents per ton-kilometer. These facts fully demonstrate that the construction of native railroads fully conforms to the Party's construction policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　The experience of building native railroads in various places over the past six months proves that in order to ensure the smooth progress of native railroad construction, first, the strong leadership of the party committee must be combined with the soaring enthusiasm of the masses. Second, the principle of "easy first, then difficult; short first, then long; first repairing lines in factory and mining areas and material concentrated areas mainly for coal and iron ore" must be adhered to in the construction of native railroads in order to achieve good results. Third, the principle of "self-financing and self-construction" must be implemented, and the enthusiasm of local and factory and mining enterprises for building native railroads must be fully utilized in order to rapidly develop native railroads. Finally, the spirit of communist cooperation must be highly promoted, and the strong assistance of the Railway Bureau must be actively sought to absorb their experience; and close contact with relevant departments must be strengthened to seek support from all parties.

### 土铁路—运输线上的一支生力军

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

　　土铁路—运输线上的一支生力军
    我省的土铁路是在工农业生产大跃进的形势下产生的，是交通建设上贯彻“洋土并举”和两条腿走路方针的产物。大跃进以来，由于钢、铁、煤炭工业和人民公社多种经济的飞跃发展，交通运输任务日益繁重，而运输过程中的短途运输任务尤其繁重。为了加强短途运输，适应客观形势的要求，我省各级党委的交通部门贯彻了省委确定的挖掘潜力与增加设备同时并举的方针，大搞群众运动，大造车船，并对怀远县红旗人民公社自修简易土铁路的创举极为重视，确认修建土铁路是解决煤、铁矿石和物资集中地区的短途运输的可靠办法，特地召开了现场会议，宣传推广怀远县的经验。并且充分利用了我省小高炉生产大量生铁这一有利的物质条件，发动群众，克服重重困难，在铁路局的帮助下，千方百计地解决了铸轨、造车、铺路等许多技术问题，从4月份到现在短短半年的时间内，建成了八条土铁路。这些土铁路运行良好，每天运输能力达六千三百余吨，给交通运输战线上增添了一支生力军。
    土铁路大有可为。现在应当肯定地这样说了。但是，有些人曾经对修建土铁路抱有怀疑态度或神秘观点，他们迷信“洋铁路”，怀疑搞土铁路能不能成功，成功了能不能解决问题；他们强调材料、设备、技术等困难条件，迟迟不敢动手，或者徘徊观望，等待别人搞成了再说。现在，他们亲眼看到了土铁路已经成功的事实，看到土铁路在短途运输上发挥出来的威力，因而疑团大解，大大提高了修建土铁路的积极性。已经建成通车的八条土铁路，充分地显示出投资少、成本低、运量大、建设快、材料易于就地解决，哪里需要就在哪里修建等优点。据有关部门计算，修建一公里洋铁路，仅是线路造价，平均约投资三十多万元；而修一公里土铁路，连机车、车辆等包括在内（桥梁除外），只要十五万多元。投资节约近一半。修洋铁路的材料和技术要求都很高，在目前国家钢轨、机车、车辆的生产还不能完全满足需要的情况下，厂矿支线短时间还不能大量修建；而土铁路则可以因陋就简，就地取材，大量修建。修洋铁路对一些蕴藏量不大的小煤窑小铁矿并不合算，小矿的生产量小，不能充分利用洋铁路的运输能力；用人力和平板车、汽车来运输煤炭、矿石，成本高，占用劳力多；修土铁路就比较经济合算。土铁路的运量大，节省劳力，同时运费低廉，风雨无阻。这又是汽车和平板车所不及的。这里算了一笔账：煤的运费，汽车每吨公里两角二分，平板车每吨公里一元，土铁路每吨公里的成本只需要五分钱。这些事实，充分说明了修建土铁路完全符合党的多快好省的建设方针。
    半年来，各地修建土铁路的经验证明，要使土铁路修建工作顺利进行，首先必须把党委的坚强领导和群众的冲天干劲结合起来。其次，修建土铁路必须坚持“先易后难，先短后长，先修以煤、铁矿为主的厂矿和物资集中的地区线路”的原则，这样才能收到良好效果。再次，必须贯彻“自筹自建”的原则，充分发挥地方和厂矿企业单位修建土铁路的积极性，才能使土铁路迅速发展。最后，必须高度发扬共产主义的协作精神，主动争取铁路局的大力帮助，吸取他们的经验；并加强与有关部门的密切联系，争取各方面的支持。
