Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Since the China Youth Daily reported on September 15th about the activities of Shanghai's young workers racing against time to enter 1960 at high speed, the slogan "Enter 1960 at High Speed" has been enthusiastically embraced by young workers nationwide. This slogan vividly embodies the spirit of the General Line, mobilizing the enthusiasm of millions of young workers. To complete this year's industrial production plan ahead of schedule and exceed quotas, the vast numbers of young workers are spurring their horses and racing against time, rapidly forming a widespread mass movement. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen cities in ten provinces, 101,274 young workers and 2,986 youth collectives have already completed this year's workload ahead of schedule and leaped into 1960. Many of them have run even further; based on the amount of work they have completed, they have already entered 1961, 1962, and even 1974.

The mass movement to "Enter 1960 at High Speed" emerged after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The Eighth Plenary Session issued the great call to oppose Rightism, boost enthusiasm, "complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year," and "catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years," greatly arousing the revolutionary drive of young workers. Shanghai's young workers loudly shouted the slogans "Race against time" and "Be a person who runs ahead of time," and the first group of pacesetters, such as young worker Qiu Meicai, who advanced into 1963 ahead of schedule, emerged. These slogans, because they vividly embodied the young workers' strong desire to warmly support the General Line and resolutely implement the General Line, further mobilized the young workers' enthusiasm for building socialism. As soon as it appeared, it was immediately welcomed by young workers, and various places rose up to respond. Various heroic slogans such as "Cross three seasons, leap over the whole year," "October exceeds September, one quarter equals half a year," and "Throw Father Time far behind" came from all directions, and advanced figures sprung up like mushrooms. In less than a month, a mass movement of thousands of troops striving for high speed was formed among young workers across the country. Facts have proved that the vigorous development of this movement is of great significance for encouraging the vast numbers of young people to overfulfill this year's plan, realize this year's continued Great Leap Forward, and accelerate preparations for next year's continued Great Leap Forward.

The slogan "Enter 1960 at High Speed" further stimulated the creative spirit of young workers and promoted the development of mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements. Young workers said: To surpass Father Time, we cannot rely solely on physical strength; we must put our energy into "working skillfully." With the heroic spirit of "thinking is a liberation brand, drive is a permanent brand, and determination is an invincible brand," they tried every means to reform technology and learn and promote advanced experience. In order to overfulfill the plan, the young Leap Forward group of workers in the casting workshop of the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory carried out mechanization of small-part molding and used pneumatic tools for large-part molding, changing manual operation, winning 271,127 man-hours with 271 innovations, and completing fifteen years, four months, and two days of workload. The entire group of workers flew into 1974 together. Liu Zhukun, a young milling worker in the machine repair workshop of Chengdu Radio Factory, continuously realized 28 technical innovations, such as changing the milling machine into a boring machine and changing the single-head cutting of the shaper into back-and-forth cutting, becoming the first pacesetter in the factory to enter 1960. In the race to catch up with him, the young workers of the whole factory realized more than 1,000 innovation proposals, and 498 people have already completed this year's tasks ahead of schedule. Wang Tianhou, a 19-year-old apprentice at the Wuhan Changhong Automobile Manufacturing Factory, broke the superstition that young apprentices cannot innovate, reformed 58 tool molds, and increased work efficiency by one to 180 times, entering 1960 ahead of schedule.

Young workers regard learning and popularizing advanced experience as an important method for completing plans ahead of schedule. Under the slogan of "learning from advanced workers without missing a single detail," young workers in Shanghai and Hangzhou launched the activity of "level-by-level catching up, step-by-step chasing." By finding opponents, finding gaps, and finding reasons, they identified the advanced experience of advanced producers, popularized and promoted it, and systematically and step-by-step improved technology to catch up with the advanced. Due to the promotion of driver Bi Changrong's advanced experience, six young drivers of the Hangzhou Highway Transportation Bureau have completed their annual transportation tasks ahead of schedule. The Dong Xiucai Concrete Youth Assault Team of the Second Construction Company of Hebei Province saved 184 tons of concrete and 225 cubic meters of wood for the country and increased efficiency by an average of one time due to the promotion of seven advanced experiences such as dry-hard concrete and flipping floor slabs.

The "Enter 1960 at High Speed" movement has further improved the communist spirit of young workers, and activities to catch up with the advanced and help the backward have been carried out more widely. Under the education of the Party, young workers realized that it is important to take the lead, but only a rapid advance of everyone can produce a real high speed, so they helped and encouraged each other in the competition. While taking big strides ahead of time personally, Zhang Rong, a young carpenter from the Longjiang Electric Factory in Harbin, helped the entire carpentry area to engage in mechanization, creating eight machine tools and improving seven kinds of tools, enabling the entire work area to complete three and a half years of work at once, and 29 people jointly entered 1962. According to statistics from eight factories, including Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Shenyang Transformer Factory, and Xi'an No. 4 Cotton Mill, after more than a month of activities to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward," more than 1,800 young workers have reached the level of advanced production. This has enabled the mass movement to move forward wave after wave.

In the "Enter 1960 at High Speed" activities, the Communist Youth League organizations in various places closely relied on the leadership of the Party and did their work very actively. The Shanghai League organization used the method of leaders leading the team, going deep into the grassroots, promptly discovering new things and good experiences, concentrating them, and grasping and promoting them vigorously, so that the movement rapidly formed a climax in a short period of time. The Taiyuan League organization used a variety of competition activities created by the masses in various factories and workshops throughout the city to involve 200,000 young workers in the movement. The actions of the League cadres in many other places were also very rapid. They stood at the forefront of the mass movement with full enthusiasm, planted red flags, erected pacesetters, and organized rich and colorful competitions to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, becoming a distinct feature of the League's work during this period.

Now, at the beginning of this fourth quarter, young workers in various places are seizing the opportunity and launching a decisive battle with Father Time. The good news of a good start to October production and a batch of young people entering 1960 is flying in from all over the country like snowflakes. (Attached picture)

　　反右倾　鼓干劲　争分秒　赶时间
    十万青工高速度跨进1960年
    大批先进生产者和先进集体提前完成今年工作量
　　新华社11日讯　自从9月15日中国青年报报道了上海青年工人争分夺秒高速度跨进1960年的活动以来，“高速度跨进1960年”的口号，已经得到
  全国青年工人热烈响应。这个口号生动地体现了总路线精神，调动了千千万万青年工人的积极性。广大青年工人为提前和超额完成今年工业生产计划，挥鞭策马，和时间赛跑，迅速形成了一个广泛的群众运动。据十个省十四个市的不完全统计，目前已经有十万一千二百七十四名青年工人、二千九百八十六个青年集体提前完成了今年工作量，飞跃进入了1960年。其中有许多人跑得更远，按其所完成的工作量计算，已经进入1961年和1962年，甚至1974年。
    “高速度跨进1960年”的群众运动，出现在党的八届八中全会以后。八中全会发出的反右倾、鼓干劲，“在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标”“十年左右在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国”的伟大号召，大大激发了青年工人的革命干劲。上海青年工人响亮地喊出了“和时间赛跑”“做一个跑在时间前面的人”的口号，涌现了提前迈进1963年的青年工人仇美才等第一批标兵。这些口号，由于生动地体现了青年工人热烈拥护总路线、坚决执行总路线的强烈愿望，更加调动了青年工人建设社会主义的积极性。它一出现，立即受到青年工人的欢迎，各个地方纷纷起来响应。“跨过三季，飞越全年”“10月超9月，一季顶半年”“把时间老人远远抛在后面”等各种豪言壮语从四方传来，先进人物风起云涌。不到一个月，就在全国青年工人中间形成了一个千军万马力争高速度的群众运动。事实证明，这个运动的蓬勃开展，对于鼓舞广大青年超额完成今年计划，实现今年的继续大跃进和为明年的继续大跃进加速作好准备工作，有着巨大意义。
    “高速度跨进1960年”的口号，更进一步激发了青年工人的创造精神，促进了群众性技术革新和技术革命运动的开展。青年工人们说：赛过时间老人不能单靠拚体力，要把精力放在“巧干”上。他们以“思想是解放牌、干劲是永久牌、决心是无敌牌”的英雄气概，千方百计改革技术，学习和推广先进经验。南昌柴油机厂铸工车间青年跃进小组工人为超额完成计划，大搞小件造型机械化、大件造型使用风动工具，改变了手工操作，以二百七十一项革新赢得二十七万一千一百二十七个工时，完成了十五年四个月零两天工作量，全组工人一起飞进1974年。成都无线电厂机修车间青年铣工刘祝坤连续实现了改铣床为镗床、改牛头刨床单头吃刀为来回吃刀等二十八项技术革新，成为全厂第一个进入1960年的标兵。全厂青年工人在追赶他的竞赛中，实现革新建议一千多条，已经有四百九十八人提前完成了今年任务。武汉长虹汽车制配厂十九岁的徒工王天厚打破小徒工不能革新的迷信，改革工具模具五十八件，提高工效一倍至一百八十倍，提前跨进了1960年。
    青年工人们把学习和普及先进经验作为提前完成计划的重要方法。上海和杭州青年工人在“学先进点滴不漏”的口号下，开展“级级赶、步步追”活动。他们通过找对手、找差距、找原因的办法，找出先进生产者的先进经验，加以普及推广，有计划有步骤地提高技术，赶上先进。杭州公路运输局由于推广司机毕长荣的先进经验，已有六个青年驾驶员提前完成全年运输任务。河北省第二建筑公司董秀才混凝土青年突击队，由于推广干硬性混凝土、翻转楼板等七项先进经验，为国家节约了一百八十四吨混凝土，二百二十五立方米木材，平均提高效率一倍。
    “高速度跨进1960年”运动促使青年工人的共产主义精神更加提高，赶先进、帮落后活动更加广泛地开展起来了。青年工人们在党的教育下认识到：一马当先固然重要，万马奔腾才能出现真正的高速度，因而在竞赛中互相帮助互相鼓舞。哈尔滨龙江电工厂青年木工张荣在个人大踏步走在时间前面的同时，帮助整个木工区大闹机械化，先后创制八台机床，改进七种刀具，使全工区一举完成三年半工作量，二十九个人共同跨进1962年。据重庆建设机床厂、山西机床厂、沈阳变压器厂、西安国棉四厂等八个工厂统计，经过一个多月的“学先进、赶先进、帮落后”活动，已经有一千八百多名青年工人达到先进生产水平。这样，使群众运动一浪推一浪，不断向前发展。
    在“高速度跨进1960年”的活动中，各地共青团组织紧紧依靠党的领导，把工作做得十分活跃。上海团组织运用领导带队，深入基层，及时发现新事物和好经验、集中起来狠抓猛推的方法，使运动在短时间内迅速形成高潮。太原团组织在全市各厂各车间，运用群众创造的多种竞赛活动，把二十万青年工人都卷进了运动。其他许多地方团的干部行动也都十分迅速。他们满腔热情地站在群众运动前列，大插红旗，大树标兵，组织丰富多采的学先进赶先进竞赛，成为这一时期团的工作的鲜明特色。
    现在，在这第四季度开始的时候，各地青年工人们正抓紧时机和时间老人展开大决战。10月生产开门红、成批青年跨进1960年的捷报正像雪片一般从各地飞来。（附图片）
