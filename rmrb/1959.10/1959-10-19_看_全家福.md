　　Watching "A Whole Family"
　　Feng Zi
　　"A Whole Family" is a tragedy, but it is also a comedy. As the saying goes, the old society turned people into ghosts, and the new society turned ghosts into people. Isn't the plight of Wang Renli's family a microcosm of the old society? In the old society, how many Wang Renlis and Li Zhenguis were there? How many Chinese people, burdened by the three great mountains, didn't experience the separation of families and the destruction of homes? In the new society, haven't even ghosts been turned into people: Wang Renli dared to return to Beijing alive, Wang Rende became a top cook in the people's commune cafeteria, and Li Zhengui became a street activist. But activist Li Zhengui doesn't dare to resume her real name, Wang Guizhen, doesn't dare to meet her husband in broad daylight, has to shed tears in secret, and has to secretly miss her own children... Why is this? Wang Renli and Wang Rende, brothers, become enemies, the older brother can never forgive his younger brother for being so heartless as to sell his sister-in-law; the younger brother always harbors this regret, but can't untangle the knot in his heart: What is this for? However, in the new society, everything must be handled thoroughly, and the most important thing about liberation is liberating the mind. The era of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" is gone forever. No matter what, when people see it, they will never ignore it. Old Grandma Jing, who is in her eighties, wants to take care of Li Zhengui's worries, veteran Li Tianxiang wants to take care of them, and policewoman Ping Haiyan wants to take care of them even more. "A Whole Family" not only writes about the typical evils of the old society, but also writes about the new morals and new customs of the people in the new society. This concern is right and well-handled! It gives people's thoughts and spirit a thorough cleaning, and any dirty thoughts are exposed. It uncovers the feudal consciousness remaining in the depths of people's souls from the old society, and helps those building socialism to break through this last and most stubborn fortress, so that people can achieve complete ideological liberation, which is the theme of "A Whole Family."
　　People don't easily forget bitter experiences, and those who have struggled through the old society cherish today even more. Lao She often uses the contrast between the old and new societies to deal with his subjects, reflecting the people's gratitude and love for the Party and the government from various aspects through different subjects, and reflecting the changes in people's thoughts and feelings through their judgment and understanding of the Party's policies based on their own interests, and further reflecting the changes of the times from the development of the characters' thoughts and feelings, so that the audience and readers can relate to themselves through these characters and the transformation of their relationships, and be educated and inspired by them. "A Whole Family" plays a positive role in this regard.
　　From "A Whole Family," it can be seen that the author is striving to express the characters and life he is familiar with, and it also shows that only by writing about what you are familiar with can you better accomplish the task of "serving politics," because you are more familiar with and have a deeper understanding of what you know, and what appears in your writing is also deeper, because the author has shared the joys and sorrows of the characters, which is why the protagonists of Lao She's plays are mostly urban working people.
　　The working people living in the new society, those who have truly achieved complete spiritual liberation, are so confident, optimistic, and full of vigor. The author has observed this profound change in the spiritual state of the people from life, so the comedic character images that appear in the author's pen are extremely prominent. (Perhaps this is the reason for writing three comedies in a row since the Great Leap Forward.) Take Lin San's wife in "A Whole Family" for example, inserting such a character is not just for laughs. She is so careless, but she never forgets to help others, because she has such wonderful qualities, not to mention breaking a spout, even if she broke a teapot, people would still love her. There are not many scenes with such a character, but the author has grasped the main aspect of the character's development. Similarly, the two scenes with Aunt Tang also have a good comedic effect. These characters add a lot of color to the play, and at the same time, they bring out a strong atmosphere of the times through the characters.
　　Looking at the structure of "A Whole Family" in terms of plot development, it is truly a chain of events, one buckle connected to another. The play is almost over, but things are still developing and changing. It is not until Wang Renli's second appearance that he seems to gradually get to the point. The contradictions between the brothers are revealed, the husband and wife meet, and then the question is raised. Only then does the author dig to the bottom to find the root cause: why does a living wife who has remarried hide and dare not see her husband. During the scene where the siblings Zhaodi and Xiaoma recognize each other, some audience members were so moved that they wept, and even at the end when the family is reunited, their smiling eyes are still filled with tears. What moves people is not just such a story of joys and sorrows, but what is truly moving is this society where people can live happily. From a structural point of view, the author put a lot of thought into elaborating on the theme.
　　The China Youth Art Theater's performance can well grasp the style of the work, and comrades such as Lu Xi, Wang Ban, Shi Yu, and Wu Fengyuan have painted the characters with bright colors, especially Lu Xi and Wang Ban, two activists, both of whom have unspeakable self-contradictions, and the embodiment of the characters' personalities is just right. It is not easy to play a policewoman, but Wu Fengyuan's performance is not ordinary. Ping Haiyan is a policewoman, and at the same time a liberated young woman who has had painful experiences. Her enthusiastic service is the new style of the new society's police, and at the same time, it combines her personal feelings, making people feel more cordial.

### 看“全家福”

　　看“全家福”
　　凤子
    “全家福”是悲剧，但也是喜剧。常言说旧社会把人变成鬼、新社会把鬼变成人。咱们看王仁利一家的遭遇不就是旧社会的缩影么？旧社会不知有多少个王仁利和李珍桂，顶着三座大山的中国人民，有多少不是妻离子散，家破人亡的？到了新社会，可不是把鬼也变成了人了：王仁利敢活着回到北京，王仁德成了人民公社食堂里的一把手，李珍桂成了街道积极分子。可是积极分子李珍桂不敢恢复自己的本名王桂珍，不敢光天化日下去见自己的丈夫，不得不背着人流泪，不得不偷偷的想念自己亲生的一对儿女……这为什么呢？王仁利、王仁德亲弟兄成为仇人，哥哥永远不能原谅自己的弟弟，为什么竟忍心卖掉亲嫂嫂；弟弟永远窝着这块心病，可是自己心里也解不开这个结：这是为的什么呢？可是，新社会一切都得兜底儿来，翻身贵在翻心。“各人自扫门前雪、休管他人瓦上霜”的时代，一去不复返了，任凭什么，看到眼里，决不搁在心里，李珍桂的心事，八十来岁的井老奶奶要管，复员军人李天祥要管，女民警平海燕更要管。“全家福”不但写出了典型的旧社会的罪恶，更写出了新社会人民的新的道德、新的风气。这一管，管的对，管的好！给人们思想、精神来个大扫除，任何肮脏思想都给兜露了出来。揭开旧社会残留在人们灵魂深处的封建意识，给建设社会主义的人们打破这最后的也是最顽固的堡垒，使得人们从思想上得到彻底的解放，这也就是“全家福”主题思想所在。
    人们不太容易忘记苦难的经历，从旧社会挣扎过来的人也就加倍珍惜今天，老舍较多的运用新旧社会对比的手法来处理他的题材，从不同的题材多方面的反映出人民对党和政府的感激和爱戴，通过人民对切身利益而发出对党的政策的判断和理解，从而反映出人民思想感情的变化，更从人物思想感情的发展反映出时代的变化，使观众、读者从这些人物、人物间关系的转化联系到自己，来印证自己，从中受到教育和启发。“全家福”在这一点上起到积极的作用。
    从“全家福”看出作者是努力表现自己所熟悉的人物和生活，同时也说明了只有写自己熟悉的才能更好地完成“为政治服务”的任务，因为自己所熟悉的、理解的比较深刻，出现在笔下的也较有深度，因为作者同人物共过甘苦，这也就是为什么老舍剧作的主人翁绝大多数是城市劳动人民的缘故。
    生活在新社会里的劳动人民，真正获得了彻底的精神解放的人们，是那样具有信心、乐观、朝气勃勃。作者从生活中观察到人民精神状态的这一深刻变化，所以出现在作者笔下的、喜剧性格的人物形象极其突出。（大跃进以来，连写三部喜剧其原因也许在此。）拿“全家福”里的林三嫂来说吧，穿插这么个人物，决不是为了逗笑而已，她那样粗心，但她却忘不了自己去帮助别人，因为她有这么美好的品质，别说砸掉一个壶嘴，就是打碎了个壶人们也会喜爱她。这样一个人物，戏可不多，作者却抓住了人物发展的主要的一面。同样唐大嫂的两场戏，也收到很好的喜剧效果。这些人物为戏增加了不少色彩，同时通过人物也带出来浓厚的时代气息。
    就剧情发展来看“全家福”的结构，真是一环套一环，一扣接一扣。戏都快收尾了，事情还在发展、变化。王仁利第二次上场这才似乎逐渐接触到正题。兄弟间的矛盾揭开了，夫妻见了面，问题这才提出来，作者这时候才兜底刨出了根，为什么改嫁了的活人妻，躲着不敢见自己的丈夫。招弟、小马姊弟相认一场观众有的感动到泣不成声，而最后一家团圆时在笑着的眼睛里也还都含着泪。人们感动的不止是这么一个悲欢离合的故事，真正令人感动的是人们都能幸福地生活的这个社会。从结构来看，作者对主题的阐发是费了一番设计的。
    中国青年艺术剧院的演出能很好的把握作品的风格，在人物创造上路曦、王班、石羽、吴凤媛等同志给人物涂上了鲜明的彩色，特别是路曦和王班，两个积极分子，而都有难言的自我矛盾，在人物性格的体现上是恰到好处的。女民警不好演，而吴凤媛演来不一般化，平海燕是民警，同时也是有过痛苦遭遇的翻身的女青年，她的热心服务是新社会民警的新作风，同时结合了她个人的感情，给人印象也就更亲切。
