Push the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to a New Peak
The Enlarged Meeting of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the CPC Deploys Current Work and Next Year's Production

    (Our Dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the CPC recently held an enlarged meeting of the provincial committee to conscientiously study and discuss the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The comrades who attended the meeting unanimously agreed that the various resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were completely correct and timely, and expressed their firm support. The meeting used a large number of vivid facts to refute the slanders of domestic and foreign hostile elements and a very small number of right-leaning opportunists within the Party against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the Great Steel Campaign, and the People's Communes. The meeting considered that the current central task of the Party in the province is to oppose the Right, encourage great effort, and further carry out a vigorous increase production and practice economy movement to strive to ensure the over-fulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan; and on the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward, to prepare for next year's various productions and ensure a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward next year.
    This meeting began on August 27 and ended on September 21. The meeting unanimously pointed out that Anhui Province, like all parts of the country, has achieved brilliant results in industrial and agricultural production since the Great Leap Forward situation began in the winter of 1957. In terms of agricultural production, large-scale, mass-based water conservancy construction has been carried out over the past two years, and many places in the province have basically changed their historical face of frequent disasters. This year, the province's actual irrigated water storage has reached 10.6 billion cubic meters, and the irrigated area has increased from 23.74 million mu in the early days of liberation to 61 million mu. This has greatly reduced the impact of the drought that was encountered this year, which was rare in decades. The People's Communes have played a huge advantage in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production. Therefore, the total output of summer grain crops in the province this year still reached 8 billion jin, an increase of 200 million jin compared with the summer grain output of 1958, which was a bumper harvest, despite the reduction in the sown area last autumn and the drought in some areas. Although autumn crops suffered a more severe drought than last year, the output still increased significantly compared with last year due to the cooperative spirit of the People's Communes. In addition, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed greatly. In terms of industry, the backward state of the iron and steel industry in Anhui Province has been greatly changed. During the Great Steel Campaign last year, small blast furnaces were generally established throughout the province. In just four months, 1,260 blast furnaces with a volume of 8 to 28 cubic meters were built, with a total volume of 13,525 cubic meters, and an annual pig iron production capacity of more than 3 million tons. This year, the pig iron produced by these small blast furnaces accounted for 61.4% of the total pig iron production. From January to August this year, the province has produced more than 1.15 million tons of pig iron, an increase of five times compared with the same period last year. If the production capacity of 1957 before the Great Leap Forward was used, it would take five years to produce this amount. The province plans to build and rebuild 42 three-ton converters this year. From May to now, 34 have been built and put into production. From January to August this year, the province has produced 74,000 tons of steel, an increase of 36.8 times compared with the same period last year, while the province's steel production was still blank in 1957. With the rapid development of the iron and steel industry, the overall Great Leap Forward of other industries has been driven. From January to August this year, the total industrial output value increased by 60.2% compared with the same period last year, of which coal production increased by 92% and power generation increased by 1.29 times.
    The meeting considered that the above-mentioned great achievements further proved that the Party's General Line and the policy of walking on two legs are completely correct, and further proved the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune system. The material and technical basis for continuing the Great Leap Forward in the future has been greatly strengthened, and any attacks and slanders cannot stop us from continuing to move forward by leaps and bounds. Therefore, the attendees unanimously agreed that the current situation is extremely good and is a favorable condition for realizing this year's Great Leap Forward. Guaranteeing the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan is of great significance: after the realization of this year's plan, the main indicators of the province's original Second Five-Year Plan can be completed or nearly completed three years ahead of schedule this year, and the main indicators of the twelve-year agricultural development program can be basically realized this year, and it can lay a better foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. Based on this, the meeting made arrangements for current work and next year's production:
    In terms of agriculture: at present, we must firmly grasp the field management of late autumn crops, strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops to make up for the losses caused by drought to mid-autumn crops, and we must do a good job in autumn harvesting, achieving careful harvesting and threshing, and ensuring that every grain is stored in the warehouse, striving to increase grain production by more than 12% compared with 1958 this year, cotton production by about 90%, and oil production by 40.8%, and strive to exceed these targets. In order to win a greater bumper harvest next year, we must do a good job in this year's autumn planting, expand the autumn sowing area, and complete the autumn planting plan of 58.67 million mu on time, with quality, and in quantity (an expansion of 17.72 million mu compared with last year); we must vigorously carry out water conservancy construction, vigorously accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, ensure that water storage increases by another 10 billion cubic meters, and accumulate 468.9 million dan of fertilizer; we must expand the cultivated area, expand the spring sowing area and the area of rice conversion next year, and universally promote improved varieties, and plant more high-yield and early-maturing crops, requiring the reclamation of 7.5 million mu of wasteland this winter and next spring, and the expansion of the spring sowing area from more than 24 million mu to 44.09 million mu. The area of rice conversion in northern Anhui will be expanded from 5 million mu this year to 8.8 million mu, and cotton and tobacco will all be converted to spring sowing in order to avoid disasters and increase production; we must quickly establish agricultural machinery manufacturing and management institutions, strengthen the manufacturing and management of agricultural machinery, vigorously carry out tool reform, and vigorously develop biogas, laying the foundation for the high-speed development of agriculture. Ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production next year. While vigorously developing agricultural production, we must rationally arrange labor, vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and diversify production.
    In terms of industry, we must continue to work hard to improve quality, reduce costs, accelerate the degree of mechanization, and increase labor productivity to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan of 230,000 tons of steel, 2.16 million tons of iron, and 16 million tons of coal. For daily necessities, light industrial products, and handicraft products, we must continue to tap potential, expand sources of raw materials, and increase production as soon as possible. The production plans for other industrial products must also be guaranteed to be completed and over-fulfilled. The meeting also put forward requirements for transportation, finance and trade, and science, culture, and education.
    The meeting demanded that while striving to increase production, we must practice strict economy, oppose waste, and people in both urban and rural areas should develop a good habit of saving.
    The meeting emphasized: all favorable conditions must be brought into play through people's subjective efforts, and it is impossible to do anything without a spirit of hard work. The main danger at present, as pointed out by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, is that right-leaning opportunist trends of thought exist in varying degrees in various aspects and departments in various forms. Without defeating this trend of thought, it will be impossible to muster enough energy and give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses to realize this year's Great Leap Forward plan. The experience of the past ten years proves that only by constantly overcoming the countercurrent of right-leaning opportunism can our great cause continue to move forward. Taking Anhui's steel production this year as an example, the Provincial Party Committee has repeatedly emphasized starting from the beginning of the year to muster enough energy and oppose the slack mood. It has timely carried out education and criticism targeting the right-leaning conservative ideas existing in various periods. For example, in the first quarter, it focused on criticizing the slack ideas such as "take a breather" and "take it slowly" existing among some employees, which led to a rapid increase in pig iron production; then, it criticized the newly generated wrong idea that "high output cannot be high quality, and high quality cannot be high output," and took a series of measures to significantly improve the quality of iron. Especially after the Central Committee issued instructions on opposing the Right and encouraging great effort, the Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels immediately implemented these instructions, further criticized the right-leaning ideas of a few cadres, and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees. Due to the continuous struggle against right-leaning ideas, the province's annual steel Great Leap Forward target has not declined, and a wave of Great Leap Forward has appeared on the steel front, and the province's Great Leap Forward plan is expected to be successfully realized. Many facts have proved that under the same conditions, there are two completely different effects between loosening up and encouraging great effort. For example, after Ma'anshan City criticized the fear of difficulties and slack mood among a few cadres in early August this year and mustered greater efforts, steel production in the first ten days of August increased by 33.7% compared with the same period in July. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the Bengbu area in July was 0.853 tons. After organizing employees to study the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session in late August, their enthusiasm doubled, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces increased to 1.38 tons.
    Based on the above situation, the meeting decided to launch a new rectification movement among cadres, conduct a debate on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, criticize right-leaning sentiments, right-leaning ideas, and various erroneous arguments, improve ideological awareness, make the high tide of production and construction continue to advance, make the People's Communes more consolidated and sound, and make our experience richer and work efficiency higher.
    During the meeting, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and the arrangements for production made by the Provincial Party Committee have been conveyed to various places, and a new mass production upsurge has been formed. A super-production movement centered on managing late autumn crops well, harvesting mid-autumn crops well, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and winning high yields has been launched in the rural areas of the province. By early September, 10.89 million mu of late autumn crops in the province had been weeded and top-dressed, and more than 2 million mu of seedlings had been checked and replanted. More than 7 million mu of mid-season rice has been harvested, and careful harvesting and threshing have been carried out to ensure that every grain is stored in the warehouse. Autumn fertilizer accumulation has also started in full swing, with 2.6 billion dan of various fertilizers accumulated in ten days. At present, vigorous inspections, evaluations, and competitions are being carried out everywhere, and autumn plowing and autumn planting have been carried out ahead of schedule. In terms of industrial production, the broad masses of employees throughout the province are in high spirits and have won the victory in the first round of the great battle in September. Steel production in the first ten days of September increased by 54.21% compared with the same period in August, and iron production increased by 36.24%, creating the highest record for ten-day output since the beginning of this year. After the daily output of iron broke through the 7,000-ton mark on September 9, it soared to 8,169 tons on the 20th; after the daily output of steel broke through the 1,000-ton mark, it also rose to 1,484 tons on September 14. The total coal output of the province had exceeded the 10 million-ton mark by September 12, an increase of 15.9% compared with the total output of the whole year last year.
    At the end of the meeting, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a summary, and gave detailed instructions on the province's opposition to the Right, encouragement of great effort, further development of the increase production and practice economy movement, and the continued Great Leap Forward next year. The meeting pointed out with full confidence that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as long as we hold high the brilliant red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, unite as one, and forge ahead bravely, we will surely be able to overcome any obstacles on the road ahead, and we will surely be able to win new great victories.

　　把增产节约运动推向新的高峰
    中共安徽省委扩大会议部署当前工作和明年生产
    本报讯　中共安徽省委最近召开省委扩大会议，认真学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会的文件，到会同志一致认为党的八届八中全会的各项决议是完全正确、及时的，表示坚决拥护。会议以大量的生动事实，驳斥了国内外敌对分子和党内极少数右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进、大办钢铁和人民公社的污蔑。会议认为，目前全省党的中心任务，就是反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为保证超额完成今年跃进计划而奋斗；并在今年跃进的基础上，做好明年各项生产的准备工作，保证明年更好更全面的跃进。
    这次会议从8月27日开始到9月21日结束。会议一致指出，安徽省和全国各地一样，从1957年冬开始形成大跃进形势以来，全省工农业生产获得了辉煌的成就。农业生产方面，两年来由于开展了大规模的、群众性的水利建设，全省不少地方已基本改变了历史上的多灾面貌。今年全省实际灌溉蓄水面积已达一百零六亿公方，灌溉面积已从解放初期的二千三百七十四万亩增加到六千一百万亩。在今年遇到了几十年来罕见的旱情下，大大减轻了灾情。人民公社在贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”方面，发挥了巨大优越性。因此，全省今年夏收粮食作物在去秋播种面积缩小和部分地区受旱的情况下，总产量仍达八十亿斤，比大丰收的1958年的夏收粮食产量还增加了两亿斤。秋季作物虽然遭受了比去年更为严重的干旱，但由于人民公社发挥协作精神，产量仍比去年有很大增长。此外，林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业，也都有了很大发展。在工业方面，安徽省钢铁工业的落后面貌已经大大改变。在去年大办钢铁运动中，全省各地普遍建立小高炉。在短短的四个月中，就建成了八至二十八立方米高炉一千二百六十座，容积为一万三千五百二十五立方米，生铁年产能力达三百多万吨。今年这些小高炉生产的生铁占全部生铁产量的61.4％。今年1至8月，全省已生产生铁一百一十五万多吨，比去年同期增长五倍，如用大跃进以前1957年的生产能力来生产，需要五年。全省今年计划新建和改建三吨转炉四十二座，从5月到现在，已建成三十四座，并投入了生产。今年1至8月份，全省已产钢七万四千吨，比去年同期增长三十六点八倍，而全省钢的生产在1957年还是空白。随着钢铁工业的飞跃发展，带动了其他工业的全面跃进。今年1至8月份与去年同期相比，工业总产值增长60.2％，其中煤产量增长92％，发电量增长一点二九倍。
    会议认为以上这些巨大的成就进一步证明了党的总路线和用两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的，进一步证明了人民公社制度的无比优越。今后继续跃进的物质技术基础已大大增强，任何攻击、污蔑，都不能阻挡我们继续大踏步前进。因此，到会者一致认为当前的形势极为良好，是实现今年跃进的有利条件，而保证完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划，又具有十分重大的意义：今年的计划实现后，全省原定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，就可以在今年内提前三年完成或接近完成，十二年农业发展纲要的主要指标，就可以在今年内基本实现，并且可以为明年继续跃进打下更为良好的基础。据此，会议对当前工作和明年生产作了部署：
    在农业方面：当前必须抓紧晚秋作物的田间管理工作，争取晚秋丰收，以弥补中秋作物受旱的损失，必须做好秋收工作，做到细收细打，颗粒归仓，争取今年粮食产量仍比1958年增产12％以上，棉花增产90％左右，油料增产40.8％，并力争超过。为了夺取明年更大丰收，必须做好今年的秋种工作，扩大秋播面积，按时、按质、按量完成五千八百六十七万亩的秋种计划（比去年扩大一千七百七十二万亩）；必须大力兴修水利，大搞积肥造肥，保证蓄水量再增加一百亿公方，积肥四百六十八万九千万担；必须扩大耕地面积，扩大明年春播面积和稻改面积，普遍推广良种，多种高产早熟作物，要求今冬明春开荒七百五十万亩，春播面积由二千四百多万亩扩大到四千四百零九万亩。淮北稻改面积由今年的五百万亩扩大到八百八十万亩，棉花、烟叶全部改为春播，以达到避灾增产的目的；必须迅速建立农业机械的制造和管理机构，加强农业机械的制造和管理工作，大搞工具改革，大力发展沼气，为高速度发展农业打下基础。保证明年农业生产继续跃进。在大力发展农业生产的同时，必须合理安排劳动力，大力发展林、牧、副、渔多种生产。
    在工业方面，必须继续努力提高质量，降低成本，加速提高机械化程度，提高劳动生产率，保证完成和超额完成今年钢二十三万吨、铁二百一十六万吨，煤一千六百万吨的跃进计划。对于日用必需的轻工业品和手工业品，必须继续挖掘潜力，扩大原料来源，尽速增加生产。其他工业产品的生产计划，也必须保证完成和超额完成。会议对交通运输、财贸以及科学、文教等工作也提出了要求。
    会议要求，在努力增产的同时，必须厉行节约，反对浪费、城乡人民都应养成良好的节约风气。
    会议着重指出：一切有利条件，都必须通过人的主观努力才能发挥作用，不论干什么事情，没有一股干劲是不行的。当前的主要危险，正如党的八届八中全会指出的就是右倾机会主义思潮以各种不同的形式在不同程度上存在于各个方面、各个部门，不战胜这种思潮，就无法鼓足干劲，就不能充分发挥广大群众的积极性，实现今年的跃进计划。十年来的经验证明，只有不断克服右倾机会主义的逆流，才能使我们的伟大事业不断前进。以今年安徽的钢铁生产为例，省委从年初开始，就一再强调鼓足干劲，反对松劲情绪，针对各个时期存在的右倾保守思想，及时地进行了教育和批判。例如在第一季度着重地批判了部分职工中存在的“歇口气”、“慢慢来”等松劲思想，使生铁产量迅速上升；接着又针对新产生的“高产不能优质，优质不能高产”的错误思想认识，进行批判，并采取一系列的措施，使铁的质量有了显著提高。特别是中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲的指示下达以后，省委和各级党委立即贯彻了这一指示，进一步批判了少数干部中的右倾思想，大大鼓舞了广大职工的干劲。由于不断与右倾思想展开斗争，全省全年的钢铁跃进指标一直没有下降，钢铁战线上出现了一浪高一浪的跃进局面，全省跃进计划预计可胜利实现。许多事实证明，在同样的条件下，一松劲和一鼓劲之间，就出现两种完全不同的效果。如马鞍山市今年8月初批判了少数干部中的畏难松劲情绪，鼓足更大干劲以后，8月上旬钢的产量比7月同期增长33.7％。蚌埠地区7月份的高炉利用系数为零点八五三吨，8月下旬组织职工学习八中全会公报和决议后，干劲倍增，高炉利用系数提高到一点三八吨。
    根据上述情况，会议决定必须在干部中开展一次新的整风运动，对总路线、大跃进和人民公社进行一场辩论，批判右倾情绪，右倾思想和各种错误论调，提高思想觉悟，使生产建设高潮持续前进，使人民公社更加巩固和健全，使我们的经验更加丰富，工作效率更加提高。
    在会议期间，各地都已传达了八届八中全会的决议，和省委扩大会议对生产的安排，一个新的广大群众性的生产高潮已经形成。以管好晚秋、收好中秋、大搞积肥，夺取高产为中心的超产运动，已在全省农村开展起来。到9月上旬，全省已有一千零八十九万亩晚秋作物锄了草、追了肥，查苗补苗二百多万亩。中稻已收割七百多万亩，并做到细收细打，颗粒归仓。秋季积肥也已全面动手，十天内就积了各种肥料二十六亿担。目前各地都在进行轰轰烈烈的大检查、大评比、大竞赛，秋耕秋种已提前进行。在工业生产方面，全省广大职工斗志昂扬，赢得了大战9月份第一个回合的胜利。9月上旬钢的产量又比8月份同期提高54.21％，铁的产量提高了36.24％，创造了今年以来旬产量的最高纪录。铁的日产量在9月9日突破七千吨大关以后，20日又猛增到八千一百六十九吨；钢的日产量也在突破千吨大关以后，9月14日又上升到一千四百八十四吨。全省的煤炭总产量到9月12日止，已经闯过了一千万吨大关，比去年全年总产量还多15.9％。
    会议最后由省委第一书记曾希圣同志作了总结，对全省反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展增产节约运动，和明年继续跃进等问题作了详细指示。会议满怀信心地指出：在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，只要高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉红旗，团结一致，奋勇前进，就一定能够战胜前进道路上的任何障碍，就一定能够赢得新的伟大胜利。
