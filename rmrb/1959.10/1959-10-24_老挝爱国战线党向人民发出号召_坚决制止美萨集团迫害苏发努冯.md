Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 23rd. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a call to action, urging all the Lao people to unite more closely to oppose the Phoui Sananikone government's intention to send Prince Souphanouvong and some leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front to court for trial, and demanding that the Phoui Sananikone government immediately restore their freedom and immediately stop the civil war and the "sweeps" and suppression of the Lao people.

The call also appealed to the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world to support the just struggle of the Lao people.

The call, published in the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on the 21st, pointed out that the imprisonment and preparation for the trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, trampling on the democratic and free rights of the people and the authority of members of parliament, and violates the Declaration of Human Rights in the United Nations Charter. At the same time, this behavior undermined the possibility of peaceful negotiations repeatedly proposed by the Lao Patriotic Front, and exposed the ambition of US imperialism and its running dogs to prolong and expand the Lao civil war.

The call said that the struggle for the freedom and safety of the lives of Prince Souphanouvong and other arrested leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front is essentially a struggle for justice, for humanitarianism, for the peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, national unity and national harmony of Laos, a struggle against US imperialism's interference in Laos, its attempt to turn Laos into its colony and military base, and also a struggle against the traitorous and harmful policies of the Phoui Sananikone group and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests".

The call said that no reactionary force can undermine the Lao people's spirit of loving their country, loving peace, loving progress, and the power of great unity. The Sananikone group's traitorous and harmful actions can only arouse the hatred of the Lao people and their resolute struggle, making them more isolated in the face of international public opinion, and will inevitably suffer a heavy defeat in the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 23rd. The "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" published an editorial on October 21st entitled "The Whole People Protects the Leader and Saves the Motherland," calling on the Lao people to fight to stop the clutches of the US-Sananikone group and restore freedom to Prince Souphanouvong and other patriotic fighters.

The editorial said that the US-Sananikone group's preparation to try Prince Souphanouvong and other seven leaders and attempt to impose heavy sentences is an attempt to cancel the already signed agreements, destroy the patriotic forces of the Lao people, and obstruct the path of peaceful negotiation, in order to expand the civil war and turn the Lao people into slaves and cannon fodder for the United States. This is trampling on the Lao constitution, depriving the Lao people of their human rights, and further fascistizing the Lao Kingdom's regime. This is an extremely brutal act!

The editorial said, "All of our people must rise up to protect the leader and save the motherland; we must smash the conspiracy of the aggressors and traitors! Peace-loving people all over the world are supporting us. All our people must unite more closely than ever before and fight to the end!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 23rd. The "People's Daily" published an editorial today saying that the Lao authorities' attempt to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. It is "a dangerous step forward in the path of the pro-American group in the Phoui Sananikone government and the heads of the extremely reactionary 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests,' at the instigation of US imperialism, in a conspiracy to eliminate the patriotic, peace-loving, democratic and progressive forces in Laos."

The editorial said that the Sananikone government's attempt to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front is a trampling on the current constitution of the Kingdom of Laos, and is also a provocation and attack on the national liberation movements and peace movements of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of the world.

The editorial concluded by saying that as a signatory to the Geneva Accords on the Laotian question, the Vietnamese people firmly oppose the aforementioned fascist trial. The Vietnamese people firmly support the just struggle of the Lao people to demand the immediate restoration of the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

    老挝爱国战线党向人民发出号召
    坚决制止美萨集团迫害苏发努冯
    新华社河内23日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发出号召书，呼吁老挝全体人民更加紧密地团结起来，反对培·萨纳尼空政府把苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党一些领导人送交法院审判，并且要求培·萨纳尼空政府立即恢复他们的自由，立即停止内战和对老挝人民的“扫荡”和镇压。
    号召书并且呼吁亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
    刊载在21日出版的“老挝爱国报”上的号召书指出，监禁和准备审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，是严重地违反了日内瓦协议和万象协议，蹂躏了人民的民主和自由权利和国会议员权限，违背了联合国宪章中的人权宣言。同时，这种行为破坏了老挝爱国战线党多次提出的和平协商的可能性，暴露了美帝国主义和它的走狗妄想延长和扩大老挝内战的野心。
    号召书说，为苏发努冯亲王和被捕的老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人的自由和生命的安全而斗争，实质上是为公理，为人道主义，为老挝的和平、中立、独立、民主、国家统一和民族和睦而斗争，是反对美帝国主义干涉老挝、企图把老挝变成它的殖民地和军事基地的斗争，也是反对培·萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们的叛国殃民的政策的斗争。
    号召书说，任何反动势力都不能破坏老挝人民爱祖国、爱和平、爱进步的精神和大团结的力量。萨纳尼空集团叛国殃民的行为只能激起老挝人民的仇恨和坚决地斗争，使它们在国际舆论面前更加孤立，最后必然遭到惨重失败。
    新华社河内23日电　10月21日出版的“老挝爱国报”以“全民保护领袖，拯救祖国”为题发表社论，号召老挝人民为扼住美国—萨纳尼空集团的魔爪，使苏发努冯亲王和其他爱国战士恢复自由而进行斗争。
    社论说，美国—萨纳尼空集团准备审讯苏发努冯亲王和其他七位领导人并企图加以重刑，是企图取消已经签订的协议，破坏老挝人民的爱国力量，阻挠和平协商的道路，以便扩大内战，使老挝人民变成美国的奴隶和炮灰。这是蹂躏老挝宪法，剥夺老挝人民的人权，使老挝王国政权进一步法西斯化。这是无比残暴的行动！
    社论说，“我们全体人民必须起来保护领袖，拯救祖国；必须粉碎侵略者和卖国贼的阴谋！全世界爱好和平的人民正在支持着我们。我国全体人民必须比任何时候更加紧密地团结起来，坚决战斗到底！”
    据新华社河内23日电“人民报”今天发表社论说，老挝当局企图对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人进行审判是严重地违反日内瓦协议的行为。它是“培·萨纳尼空政府中的亲美集团和极端反动的‘保卫国家利益委员会’的头目们，在美帝国主义的唆使下，在阴谋消灭老挝爱国、爱好和平、民主和进步力量的道路上前进了危险的一步。”
    社论说，萨纳尼空政府企图审判苏发努马亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的行为，蹂躏了老挝王国的现行宪法，同时也是对亚非各国人民和全世界人民的民族解放运动和和平运动的挑衅和进攻。
    社论最后说，作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方，越南人民坚决反对上述法西斯审判。越南人民坚决支持老挝人民要求立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由的正义斗争。
