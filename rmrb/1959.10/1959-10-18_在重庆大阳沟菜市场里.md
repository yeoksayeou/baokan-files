　　In the Dayanggou Vegetable Market in Chongqing

    Anyone who has been to Chongqing knows about the Dayanggou Vegetable Market. It is one of the largest and oldest vegetable markets in Chongqing. It has a complete range of goods, including vegetables, dried vegetables, fruits, flowers, and many economical snack shops for the convenience of customers. However, in my memory as a Chongqing resident, it used to be an unpleasant place: the smell of rotten fish and stale vegetables permeated the air, flies buzzed around, and on rainy days, the rotten mud underfoot was half a foot deep; the market was full of arguments and shouts....

    Today, after returning to Chongqing several years after leaving, the Dayanggou Vegetable Market has completely changed its appearance – beautiful and magnificent archways have been erected at the front and back gates, bamboo mat sheds have been built over the streets, stone slabs have been laid on the ground, news photos are displayed along the roadside, and inspiring slogans are posted on paper signs... What is particularly exciting is that after hundreds of small vendors have organized themselves, the service attitude of the staff and the sanitary environment of the market are vastly different from what they used to be!

    When I went, it was during the bustling morning market. The vegetable market was packed with people. Old men and women with canes, housewives with children, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves all came here with baskets to buy vegetables. A young woman with a child was buying fresh vegetables, picking out the ones she liked and putting them on the scale while picking out the less desirable ones from the scale. In the past, the salesperson would have frowned and said, "If you don't want to buy it, then forget it!" But today, the salesperson actually helped her pick them out. As they left, they smiled and nodded goodbye to each other, and the child waved his little hand and said, "Uncle, goodbye!"

    Many people who were tired from walking around would go to the mass service station to rest. The mass service station is an innovation created by the staff of the vegetable market since the Great Leap Forward, with the customers in mind. Five mass service stations are distributed in the gaps within the market. Customers have given it a beautiful name, "VIP Seating." The furnishings of the "VIP Seating" are very simple, with only a few long wooden chairs for customers to rest; but the staff member wearing a red armband is courteous and kind to people. If elderly people or pregnant women come to rest, he will ask them if they need help buying vegetables. After the vegetables are bought, he will ask them if they need help delivering them home. When I went, I saw a customer holding an old pumpkin and asking the service staff to peel it, because here, the market also provided processing services for customers, such as cutting vegetables, pinching vegetables, peeling melons, etc. The staff of the vegetable market told me that the market also regularly sends people to visit patients, women in confinement, disabled people, etc., to understand their needs and deliver things to their door.

    The vegetable market is kept very clean. The glass is bright and shiny, the wooden boards are washed white, and flies are almost extinct. This is due to the efforts of the market's sanitation management committee. There are dedicated people doing cleaning work, and the staff are constantly tidying up their stalls. The salesperson selling aquatic products is carefully cleaning the stone basins that are divided into grids, scooping out the dirty water and pouring in clean water. The little turtles that are shrinking their heads and the snails that are curled up into balls are leisurely wriggling, obviously very satisfied with this clean and refreshing environment.

    At ten o'clock, the customers in the vegetable market gradually thinned out. The sales staff rolled up their sleeves, picked up brooms, and began regular washing and cleaning. The bright sunlight shone through the bamboo mat shed, illuminating everywhere and making the appearance of the vegetable market even more radiant and vibrant.

　　在重庆大阳沟菜市场里
　　李素
    到过重庆的人，都知道大阳沟菜市场。这是重庆最大最老的菜市场之一。这里货色齐全，蔬菜、干菜、水果、鲜花等应有尽有，还有许多便利顾客的经济小吃店。但是在我这重庆人的印象里，过去却是个不愉快的地方：烂鱼陈菜的气味弥漫着，苍蝇嗡嗡地飞来飞去，下雨天，地下的烂稀泥有半脚深；菜场里到处是争吵、叫嚷的声音……。
    今天，在我离开重庆好几年后回来再看到大阳沟菜市场时，它的面貌却完全变了——前后门扎起了美丽壮观的牌坊，街顶上搭起了篾棚，地下铺起了石板，路边上陈列着新闻图片，纸牌上张贴着激动人心的标语……特别使人振奋的是几百家小商贩组织起来以后，营业员的服务态度和市场内的卫生环境同往年比起来，更是大不相同了！
    我去的时候，正是热闹的早市。菜市场内挤满了人。拄着拐杖的老头子，老太婆，携儿带女的家庭主妇，系红领巾的少先队员，都挎着篮子，到这里来买菜。一个带着孩子的年青妇女正在买鲜菜，她一面把中意的拣到秤盘里去，一面又把差一些的从秤盘里挑出来。这样挑挑选选，要在过去，营业员早就会扳着脸说：“你要不买就算了！”但是今天，那个营业员却反而帮助她挑。临去时，他们互相微笑点头道别，孩子也摇着小手说：“叔叔，再见！”
    许多人走来走去走累了，便到群众服务台去休息。群众服务台是大跃进以来，菜市场的工作人员开动脑筋为顾客着想的创举。五个群众服务台分布在市场内的空隙处。顾客们送给它一个美号，“雅座”。“雅座”的陈设很简单，只有几张长木椅供顾客憩坐；但是那带着红臂章的服务员对人却是殷勤而又亲切的。老年人或者孕妇来休息，他便问他们要不要他帮忙买菜。菜买好了以后，他又问他们要不要他帮忙送回家去。我去的时候，正看见一个顾客抱着一个老南瓜请服务员刨皮，原来这里还可以代买主加工，如像切菜、掐菜、刨瓜等等。菜市场的工作人员告诉我，市场还经常派人们去访问病人、产妇、残废人等，了解他们的需要，把东西给他们送上门去。
    菜市场内收拾得干干净净。玻璃擦得亮堂堂的，木板洗得白生生的，苍蝇也几乎绝迹了。这是市场内卫生管理委员会的功绩。有专人做清扫工作，营业员们也不断收拾着自己的小摊子。卖水产的营业员正细心地在清理那制成一格一格的石盆，把脏水舀出去，把清水灌进来。那里面缩着头的小乌龟和蜷成一团的螺蛳怡然自得地蠕动，显然它们也很满意这干净爽利的处境。
    十点钟，菜市场的顾客逐渐稀少了。营业员们便卷起袖子，拿起扫帚，开始了定期的冲洗和清扫。明丽的阳光从篾棚上透射进来，照得四处闪闪发亮，显得菜市场的面貌更加光彩，更加有生气了。
