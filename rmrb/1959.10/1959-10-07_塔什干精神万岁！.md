    Long Live the Tashkent Spirit!
    Mao Dun

    One year ago today, writers from Asian and African countries gathered in Tashkent, opening a new page in the history of Asian and African literature.

    This statement is by no means an exaggeration.

    Although cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries have existed for thousands of years, it was the first time that writers from Asian and African countries gathered together. What needs to be especially emphasized is that although the writers from the Asian and African countries participating in this conference had different religious beliefs and political convictions, their love for their own people, their love for their own national traditions and literary treasures, and their hatred for imperialism, colonialism, and racial discrimination united them.

    The "Letter to World Writers" unanimously adopted by the Tashkent Conference is a historic document. Every sentence in it is filled with confidence in the bright future of mankind and adheres to the determination to strive for the cause of human progress—and this is the basis for the unity of the vast number of Asian and African writers!

    This is the Tashkent Spirit! This is the Tashkent Spirit that has inspired and enlightened writers in Asia and Africa since then!

    On the first anniversary of the Tashkent Conference, we are particularly pleased to see that, thanks to the consistent and unremitting efforts of the Soviet people and the Soviet government, and especially thanks to the recent visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States, there is a tendency for international tensions to ease. Especially after the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament was put forward at the United Nations General Assembly, everyone in the world saw the dawn of lasting peace.

    The development of historical laws dictates that the small handful of die-hards in international aggressive blocs are doomed to end in failure. The more clear-headed people in the bourgeoisie have already realized this. But "they never give up until all hope is lost." The small handful of die-hards in international aggressive blocs are still unwilling to lay down their butcher knives without a struggle. In addition to adhering to the Cold War, they will also mobilize all cultural tools to conduct ideological warfare, distorting facts, deceiving the people, and preparing for hot wars. We writers from Asian and African countries can be said to be on the front lines of this ideological war. Let us carry forward the Tashkent spirit, wield our mighty pens to repel the reactionary dark currents, and resolutely serve the cause of world peace and human progress!

    The Soviet Union has successfully launched an automatic interplanetary station! This is a milestone in mankind's conquest of the universe. We admire and should learn from the courage and wisdom of Soviet scientists. Let us use the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism to write epics of the Asian and African people, to express the spiritual world of the people, and to reflect this great era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind! (Here, please do not view the famous saying "the East wind prevails over the West wind" in a geographical sense; here, from a political point of view, the East wind represents socialism and the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and anti-fascist national and democratic movements, while the West wind represents capitalism, colonialism, fascism, and other reactionary things that are doomed to decline.)

    We also hope that through the joint efforts of writers from Asian and African countries, the resolutions of the Tashkent Conference will be implemented in a timely manner, laying the necessary foundation for further unity among Asian and African writers, for cultural exchanges between Asian and African countries, and for the next Asian and African Writers Conference!

    Let us shout: Long Live the Tashkent Spirit!

    塔什干精神万岁！
    茅盾
    一年前的今天，亚非各国作家在塔什干欢聚一堂，为亚非文学史展开了新的一页。
    这句话，丝毫也不夸张。
    亚非各国间的文化交流虽然已有千百年的历史，但是，亚非各国作家欢聚一堂，这却是第一回；特别要大书特书的是：参加这次大会的亚非各国的作家们虽然宗教信仰不同，政治信念不同，但是对于自己人民的热爱，对于自己的民族传统和文学宝藏的热爱，对于帝国主义、殖民主义和种族歧视的憎恨，把他们团结在一起。
    塔什干会议所一致通过的“亚非作家会议告世界作家书”，是一个历史性的文献，它的每一句话都洋溢着对于人类的美好未来的信心，都坚持着为了人类进步事业而奋斗的决心——而这，正是广大的亚非作家团结的基础！
    这就是塔什干精神！这就是从那时起鼓舞并启发了亚非两大洲的作家们的塔什干精神！
    在塔什干会议一周年的时候，我们特别高兴看到，由于苏联人民和苏联政府一贯的不懈的努力，更由于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志新近在美国的访问，国际紧张局势有缓和的趋势，特别是苏联的彻底、全面的裁军方案在联合国大会提出以后，普天之下人人都看到了持久和平的曙光。
    历史规律的发展注定了国际侵略集团的一小撮顽固分子必以失败告终。资产阶级中间头脑清醒的人们已经认识到这一点了。可是“不到黄河心不死”，国际侵略集团的一小撮顽固分子还是不甘心不作挣扎而放下屠刀的。他们除了坚持冷战，还将动员一切文化工具来进行思想战，歪曲事实、欺骗人民，为热战作准备。我们亚非各国的作家们，在这场思想战中，可以说是处在最前线的。让我们发挥塔什干精神，挥如椽之笔击退反动的黑流，坚决地为世界和平与人类进步事业服务！
    苏联发射自动行星际站已经成功！这是人类征服宇宙的一座里程碑。苏联的科学家们的魄力和智慧值得我们钦佩，也值得我们学习。让我们用革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的精神，为表现人民的精神世界、为反映这东风压倒西风的大时代而写下亚非人民的史诗！（在这里，请勿以地理的意义来看待“东风压倒西风”这句名言；在这里，从政治意义上来看，东风代表了社会主义以及反帝、反殖民主义、反法西斯的民族、民主运动，而西风则代表了资本主义、殖民主义、法西斯主义等反动的注定了要没落的东西）。
    我们也盼望，通过亚非各国作家的共同努力，及时地实现塔什干会议的决议，为亚非作家的进一步团结，为亚非各国的文化交流，为下一次的亚非作家会议准备必要的基础！
    让我们高呼：塔什干精神万岁！
