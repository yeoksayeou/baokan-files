Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st: The Ying Zhongfa group of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, which has maintained the honor of advanced collective for nine years, has again completed the annual production task, which is 125.7% more than last year, in nine months, and has begun to stride into 1960. Entering October, the group increased the fourth quarter's task by 40% compared to the third quarter. They are determined to complete five months of work in the three months of the fourth quarter, and at the same time prepare for next year's production, so that the production in the first quarter of next year will increase by 15% compared to the fourth quarter of this year.

The Ying Zhongfa group was previously led by Lu Agou, a nationally renowned model worker. Since 1950, when the group first won the title of advanced group, it has continuously advanced under the red flag for nine years. In the past nine years, all of the group's more than 100 members have been closely united and have become stronger and stronger. From the group's planned production starting in 1953 to September of this year, they have completed the state plan every month for eighty-one consecutive months, of which seventy-eight months have comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the factory completed the production task of 350,000 spindles of textile machinery, while the Ying Zhongfa group processed parts for 600,000 spindles. This year, their labor productivity has been further improved, achieving the equivalent of one person doing the work of two people last year.

Persisting in putting politics in command and continuously planting ideological red flags is the fundamental reason why this group has achieved advancement and can maintain it. In recent years, everyone who has been transferred to this group has become more active if they were already active; those who were generally performing or relatively backward have also made progress after the group's assistance, and some have even become backbones. Therefore, people call the Ying Zhongfa group a communist "furnace." For example, when a young worker first came to the group, he was unorganized and undisciplined. When he produced defective products, he was afraid of being held accountable and secretly stuffed them into the furnace to melt them down. After the group discovered this, they severely criticized him and sent a teacher to specifically help him. With the help of the group, the young man made rapid progress and soon joined the Communist Youth League and the Party, becoming a backbone of the group. Under his influence, the other four backward workers who were originally with him, known as the "Five Brothers," also changed. In this way, the Ying Zhongfa group has cultivated a large number of new workers and backbones for the country, supported newly built factories in other places and other fraternal factories. Among them, eleven people from their group have been promoted to cadres, and twenty-eight skilled workers have been transferred out.

The Ying Zhongfa group also frequently combines political work with production work. When the group receives major production tasks, they first widely discuss the significance of these tasks for national construction. Therefore, no matter how heavy the task or how urgent the time, the group members can be full of energy and do everything possible to complete it. For example, before the Spring Festival this year, the No. 1 State Cotton Factory asked them to help punch out a part called a "sleeve" within a week, which would be used to transform the old-fashioned spinning machines into the world's most advanced super-draft fine spinning machines. At that time, there was only one week left before the Spring Festival, and the group's production tasks were very tight, so the workshop leaders were hesitant to agree. However, after the Ying Zhongfa group learned about it, they believed that it was a great initiative to support the No. 1 State Cotton Factory and was of great significance, so they resolutely demanded to accept it. They used their brains, boldly reformed the product design, and after three days and nights of hard work, they finally completed the task ahead of schedule.

The Ying Zhongfa group's production tasks have increased year by year and improved month by month, and there are often "rush" jobs, but their machines are very old, and most of them are "old-fashioned punches" driven by belts. The way they solve this contradiction is to promote the idea of "constantly making revolution, everyone making innovation" among the group members through practical examples of publicity and education, so that technological revolution and technological innovation become more and more frequent, and labor productivity increases more and more. During the first five-year plan, there were 232 documented innovation projects, 103 were realized in 1958, and 430 were proposed from January to September this year, 360 of which have been realized. They have also successfully trial-produced the cutting-edge product of textile machinery—the "spring grid" part, realizing the ideal of all parts of the spinning machine being manufactured in China.

### 应忠发小组跨进了1960年

    应忠发小组跨进了1960年
    新华社上海21日电　九年来一直保持先进集体荣誉的国营上海第二纺织机械厂应忠发小组，今年又以九个月的时间提前完成了比去年增加125.7％的全年生产任务，开始跨进了1960年。进入10月，这个小组又把第四季度的任务比第三季度提高了40％。他们决心在第四季度的三个月内干完五个月的活，同时作好明年的生产准备工作，使明年第一季度的生产再比今年第四季度提高15％。
    应忠发小组以前是由全国著名的劳动模范陆阿狗领导的。这个小组自从1950年开始，第一次获得先进小组的称号后，九年来一直高举红旗不断前进。九年来，全组一百多人紧密团结，愈战愈强，从1953年开始有小组计划到今年9月份，连续八十一个月，月月完成国家计划，其中有七十八个月全面超额完成国家计划。在去年大跃进中，全厂完成三十五万锭的纺织机械生产任务，而应忠发小组就加工成六十万锭的零件。今年，他们的劳动生产率进一步提高，做到了一个人抵上去年两个人。
    坚持政治挂帅，不断地插思想红旗，是这个小组获得先进、并能保持先进的根本原因。几年来，凡是调到这个小组来的人，原来积极的更积极了；原来表现一般的或比较落后的，经过小组的帮助，也都进步起来，有的还成了骨干。因此，人们称应忠发小组为共产主义的“熔炉”。例如有一个青年工人初到小组时，行动散漫，出了废品怕追究责任，偷偷地把废品塞到炉子里熔掉，小组发现后，一面严肃地批评他，一面派老师具体帮助他。在小组帮助下，这个青年进步很快，不久以后就入了团、入了党，成了小组的骨干。在他的影响下，原来和他在一起号称“五兄弟”的其他四个落后工人也跟着转变过来了。应忠发小组就是这样，为国家培养了大批新工人和骨干，支援外地新建工厂和其他兄弟厂，其中从他们小组中提拔为干部的有十一人，输送出去的技术工人有二十八人。
    应忠发小组还经常把政治工作和生产工作结合起来。当小组接到重大的生产任务时，首先广泛讨论这些任务对国家建设的意义。因此不论任务多么重，时间多么紧迫，小组组员们都能干劲十足，千方百计地完成。例如今年春节前，国棉一厂要求他们厂在一星期内帮助冲制一种叫做“套管”的零件，用来把旧式细纱机改为世界最新的超大牵伸精纺机。当时离春节只有一星期，小组生产任务非常紧，车间领导人不敢答应下来。但是应忠发小组知道后，认为这是支援国棉一厂的创举，意义很大，坚决要求接受下来。他们开动脑筋，大胆改革产品设计，经过苦战三昼夜，终于提前完成了任务。
    应忠发小组的生产任务年年增加，月月提高，不时还有“突击”活，而他们的机器却很陈旧，大部分是用皮带拖的“老爷冲床”。他们解决这个矛盾的办法就是：通过实例宣传教育，在组员中树立“不断闹革命，人人闹革新”的思想，使技术革命和技术革新愈闹愈多，劳动生产率愈提愈高。在第一个五年计划期间，有案可查的革新项目为二百三十二项，1958年实现了一百零三项，今年1月到9月提出四百三十项，已实现三百六十项，并且还试制成功纺织机械上的尖端产品——“弹格”零件，实现了细纱机零件全部由本国制造的理想。
