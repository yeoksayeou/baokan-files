Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: D.N. Pritt, President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, told Xinhua reporters today that the recent illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States is "very disgraceful and extremely harmful to the prestige of the United Nations." This resolution "will not produce any legal value or effect because they have absolutely no right to discuss and pass this resolution."

    Pritt said: "It is obvious that the true intention of this political action by the United States is, first, to create hostility towards China and to create another excuse to oppose China's legitimate status in the United Nations. Its purpose is specifically to continue creating a Cold War, making peace and disarmament agreements difficult to achieve."

    Pritt said: "One of the important fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter is that one should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; if this principle is not well observed, then the United Nations will only fall into chaos and create mutual distrust." He emphasized: "Historically, politically, and diplomatically, Tibet is definitely a part of China. Therefore, what we are facing is nothing more than a futile attempt by the United States to damage the socialist camp and the prestige of the United Nations."

    This democratic legal worker, who has won the Lenin International Peace Prize for his work in defending peace, further said: "From what I understand, the system in Tibet is a backward, barbaric, and cruel serf system. Why did such a backward system exist until recently? The only reason is that China's policy towards backward ethnic minorities is to make changes with the consent of the ethnic minorities, rather than using violent methods to bring about such changes."

    "The United States, which used to be a country with bourgeois democratic traditions, is now openly defending this backward system, which shows how degraded the US government has become. It can be said that frantically attacking socialist countries has become an important part of their political life." He believes that the United States and its followers are interfering in China's internal affairs in the name of protecting human rights, "which is as shameless as the United States protecting the Hungarian counter-revolution in the name of freedom. At that time, they also used the United Nations as a tool for intervention."

    He said that there is no reason to use the name of maintaining human rights to justify interference in the internal affairs of other countries, "because the real defenders of human rights stand on the side of the Tibetan people, not on the side of the serf owners." He believes that the excuse of "protecting human rights" is nothing but the biggest lie. He mocked: "About twenty years ago, Hitler said that as long as you use the biggest lie, you can succeed, or that if you lie enough, you can succeed. If you compare Hitler with American politicians after the war, Hitler can be regarded as the most truthful person."

    When Pritt talked about the US imperialist slander against China for "violating human rights" and "genocide," he said: "The atmosphere I see in China is a true socialist upward development atmosphere, which is incompatible with the violation of human rights, let alone genocide. During my travels in China, I have personally seen socialist countries treat ethnic minorities in a friendly manner. It is ridiculous to say that this country mistreats ethnic minorities. I advise American politicians, when accusing other countries of mistreating ethnic minorities, they had better look at the situation of black people in their own country!"

### 国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特在京发表谈话  联合国根本无权讨论“西藏问题”  美国企图借此制造“冷战”阻挠解决裁军问题

    国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特在京发表谈话
    联合国根本无权讨论“西藏问题”
    美国企图借此制造“冷战”阻挠解决裁军问题
    新华社28日讯　国际民主法律工作者协会主席丹·诺·普里特今天对新华社记者说，联合国最近在美国操纵下通过的所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，是“非常丢脸的和对联合国威信非常有害的”，这个决议“不会产生任何的法律价值和效果，因为他们根本没有权利来讨论和通过这个决议”。
    普里特说：“很明显，美国这一政治行动的真实意图，首先是对中国造成敌对情绪，并且制造另一个借口来反对中国在联合国取得合法地位，其目的特别是在于继续制造冷战，使和平和裁军协议难以达成。”
    普里特说：“联合国宪章的重要基本原则之一，是不应当干涉别国的内政；假如这个原则不很好遵守，那么联合国就只会陷于混乱和造成相互不信任。”他强调说：“无论从历史上、政治上和外交上来看，西藏肯定是中国的一部分。因此，我们面对的这件事情，不过是美国徒劳无益地损害社会主义阵营、损害联合国威信的行为。”
    这位在保卫和平事业中曾经获得列宁国际和平奖金的民主法律工作者还进一步说：“据我了解，西藏的制度是一个落后的、野蛮的、残酷的农奴制度。为什么这样落后的制度，不久前还存在着，唯一的理由是中国对待落后的少数民族的政策，是采取征得少数民族同意的情况下才进行改变，而不是用暴力的方法来造成这种改变。”
    “美国在过去是一个有资产阶级民主传统的国家，现在公开来维护这种落后的制度，这说明美国政府已经堕落到了什么地步。可以这样说，疯狂地攻击社会主义国家，这已成了他们政治生活中的一个重要组成部分。”他认为，美国及其追随者在保护人权的名义下干涉中国内政，“这同美国在自由的名义下保护匈牙利的反革命是一样地无耻，当时他们也是利用了联合国作为干涉的工具的。”
    他说，没有任何理由可以利用维护人权的名义来为干涉别国内政作辩护，“因为真正的人权维护者是站在西藏人民一边，而不是站在农奴主的一边。”他认为借口“维护人权”，这不过是最大的谎言。他嘲笑说：“约在二十年以前，希特勒曾经说过，只要用最大的谎言，就可以成功，或者说谎言多了，就可以取得成功。如果把希特勒和美国战后的政治家来比较，希特勒可以算是最真实的人了。”
    普里特谈到美帝国主义诬蔑中国“破坏人权”和“灭绝种族”时说：“我在中国看到的气氛是真正的社会主义向上发展的气氛，这种气氛和破坏人权是不相容的，更谈不到灭绝种族了。我在中国的旅行中，亲眼看到社会主义国家友好地对待少数民族，如果说这个国家对待少数民族有虐待的事情，那是很可笑的。我奉劝美国的政治家们，在控诉别的国家虐待少数民族时，他们最好看看自己国家里黑人的处境吧！”
