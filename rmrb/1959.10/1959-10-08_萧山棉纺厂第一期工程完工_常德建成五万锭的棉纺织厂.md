Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th - The first phase of the Xiaoshan Cotton Textile Mill in Zhejiang has been completed and put into production before National Day.

The first phase of the Xiaoshan Cotton Textile Mill consists of 50,000 spindles and construction began in August of last year. Upon completion of the entire project, this factory will have 110,000 spindles, 3,264 looms, and the capacity to print and dye 3 million bolts of cloth annually. In the sixty years before liberation, Zhejiang province had only 57,000 spindles.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha - Hunan Province's newly built Changde Cotton Textile Mill was officially put into production on October 1st.

The factory has 50,000 spindles, and all equipment is domestically manufactured using new designs. After reaching the designed production capacity, it can produce 21,000 bales of yarn and 34.05 million bolts of cotton cloth annually. Thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the workers, and the vigorous implementation of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, many difficulties in raw materials, materials, and technology were overcome. The factory took only one year and one month from groundbreaking to completion and production. Due to the use of brick and wood structure design for the factory buildings, making it easy to obtain materials locally, the entire project saved the country more than 180 tons of steel and 2,600 tons of cement.

Changde Prefecture is a key cotton-producing area in Hunan Province. In the past, ginned cotton was transported to other places for spinning and weaving. With the completion of the Changde Cotton Textile Mill, locally produced cotton can be processed into yarn and cloth locally.

    萧山棉纺厂第一期工程完工  常德建成五万锭的棉纺织厂
    据新华社杭州6日电　浙江萧山棉纺织厂第一期工程，已在国庆节前夕建成投入生产。
    萧山棉纺织厂第一期工程为五万纱锭，是去年8月动工兴建的。全部工程建成后，这个工厂就将拥有十一万纱锭，三千二百六十四台布机，以及每年印染三百万匹布的印染能力。而在解放前六十年中，浙江全省才只有五万七千枚纱锭。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省新建的常德棉纺织厂，在10月1日正式投入生产。
    这个工厂拥有五万纱锭，全部设备都是本国制造的新型机器。达到设计产量后，每年可以生产二万一千件纱和三千四百零五万匹棉布。由于职工们苦干巧干，大力贯彻土洋结合的方针，克服了许多原料、材料和技术方面的困难，这个厂从动工建设到建成生产仅用了一年零一个月的时间。由于厂房建筑采用了砖木结构设计，便于就地取材，整个工程为国家节省了一百八十多吨钢材和二千六百多吨水泥。
    常德专区是湖南省产棉重点地区，过去都是把皮棉运到外地去纺纱织布。常德棉纺织厂建成后，当地出产的棉花就可以就地加工成纱布了。
