　　To Prosper the Culture of Minority Areas
　　Vietnam's Eight Hundred Teachers Go to the Mountains

　　More than eight hundred teachers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently responding to the call of the Vietnam Workers' Party to vigorously develop education in mountainous areas, shouldered their luggage and headed for the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in northern Vietnam. These first batch of teachers, honorably approved to work in mountainous areas, come from fourteen provinces in the plains, most of whom are young people, and most of them are Party members, Youth League members, and demobilized soldiers. They all have a lofty ideal to bring their youth and strength, and the seeds of culture to their ethnic minority brothers in the mountains.
　　Since the restoration of peace, the education in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam has developed rapidly. In the 1958-1959 academic year, the number of students in mountainous areas increased five times compared with the highest number of students during the French imperialist rule. Now, there are one thousand and seventy-nine elementary schools, fifty-three junior high schools and four high schools in the mountainous areas, with nearly 70,000 students. However, the culture in the mountainous areas is still backward, and it is far from meeting the needs of the construction and development of northern Vietnam. Therefore, vigorously developing culture and education in mountainous areas so that the mountainous areas can catch up with the plains in the shortest possible time is an important task for the Vietnamese people.
　　The Vietnam Workers' Party's call to develop culture and education in mountainous areas immediately turned into practical actions of teachers and young people, and many moving events occurred. For example, Nguyen Xuan Tuc, an elementary school teacher in Song Loc Township, Cam Loc County, Ha Tinh Province, is nearly fifty years old this year and has taught in the plains for twenty-six years. When he learned that the leadership had not approved his request, he repeatedly expressed his determination to go to the leadership. Later, after a doctor's examination, it was proved that he was in good health, and the Provincial Party Committee agreed to his request. He was very happy that he could honorably go to the mountains. Huang Shi Mian, a twenty-one-year-old young female teacher, had originally agreed with her fiancé to get married recently, but when she heard the call to go to the mountains, she thought that she was so young and should contribute to the people's cause, so that she would not waste her youth. Therefore, she decided to postpone her wedding and apply for work in the mountains. Her fiancé expressed his full support for her actions after hearing the news. Huang Shi Mian excitedly told reporters that she was extremely happy to have the opportunity to work in the mountains, and said that she would definitely listen to President Ho Chi Minh's words and carry out the "revolutionary work to the end."
　　The Party gives great care to this group of teachers who are about to go to the mountains. During the short fifteen days of study in the first batch of mountain-going teacher training class, President Ho Chi Minh personally came to the training class to see them, and Party Central Committee members Zhu Wenjin and Li You, and the Minister and Deputy Minister of Education all came to see them. President Ho Chi Minh praised the students' spirit of volunteering to serve in the mountains, and encouraged them to work hard to complete their tasks. President Ho Chi Minh said that working in mountainous areas is difficult, and everyone should persevere to the end, should give full play to the spirit of perseverance, and be determined to overcome all difficulties to complete this task.
　　At the graduation ceremony of the training class, the director of the Lao Cai Provincial Education Bureau welcomed them on behalf of the people of Lao Cai Province. He said with deep affection: "I represent the ethnic minorities to welcome you home (to the mountains)." At the same time, he expressed his gratitude to the teachers for this revolutionary spirit. The mother of teacher Nguyen Thi Nhu Lien was also invited to speak to the students. She said excitedly: "Now I am giving my third child to the Party. The first child sacrificed in the war, and the second child is on the front line defending the motherland." She said: "I am really excited and honored to have my daughter in the first batch of teachers who went to work in the mountains." She also told these expeditionary children - mountain teachers, to learn from the glorious example of revolutionary martyrs, and to unite closely with ethnic minority compatriots and serve them wholeheartedly. The students all said: We must listen to the Party's words, listen to President Ho Chi Minh's words; regard the mountainous areas as their second hometown, regard ethnic minorities as their own flesh and blood brothers, and strive to overcome difficulties and complete the glorious tasks assigned to them by the Party.

### 繁荣少数民族地区文化  越南八百教师上山

　　繁荣少数民族地区文化
    越南八百教师上山
    越南民主共和国的八百多位教师，最近响应越南劳动党关于大力发展山区教育的号召，背起行装，走向越北各少数民族居住的山区。这些光荣地被批准到山区工作的第一批教师，来自平原十四个省份，大部分是青年，其中多数是党、团员和转业军人。他们都具有一个崇高的理想，要把自己的青春和力量，把文化种子带给山区少数民族兄弟们。
    自从和平恢复以来，越南北方山区的教育事业获得了迅速的发展。1958—1959年度，山区的学生人数比法帝国主义统治时期的最高学生人数增加了五倍。现在，山区已经有一千零七十九所小学，五十三所初中和四所高中，学生人数近七万人。但是，山区的文化仍然是落后的，它还远远不能适应越南北方建设发展的需要。因此，大力发展山区文化教育，使山区在最短的时间内赶上平原地区，是越南人民的一项重要任务。
    越南劳动党关于发展山区文化教育的号召，马上变成了广大教师和青年的实际行动，出现许多感人的事例。例如，河静省甘禄县双禄乡小学教师阮春足，今年已经将近五十岁，在平原地区教了二十六年书。当他知道领导上没有批准他的要求时，曾一再向领导表示坚决要去，后来经过医生的检查，证明他的身体健康，省委才同意了他的要求。他非常高兴他能够光荣上山了。二十一岁的年青女教师黄氏棉，原来已经和未婚夫约好最近结婚，但是当她听到上山的号召时，她想，自己如此年青，应该为人民的事业贡献力量，才算不虚度青春。因此，她决定推迟婚期，申请上山工作。她的未婚夫闻讯后向她表示，完全支持他的行动。黄氏棉兴奋地对记者说，她能够有机会到山区工作，感到无比高兴，并且表示，一定听胡主席的话，把“革命工作干到底。”
    党对这批将要上山的教师给予极大的关怀。在第一批上山教师训练班学习的短短十五天中，胡志明主席亲自来到训练班看望他们，劳动党中央委员朱文晋、李友，教育部部长、副部长都曾经来看望他们。胡主席对学员们自愿上山服务的精神表示赞扬，并且勉励他们要努力完成任务。胡主席说，在山区工作是有困难的，大家应该坚持到底，应该发挥坚忍的精神，决心克服一切困难完成这个任务。
    在训练班的结业式上，老街省教育局局长代表老街省的人民欢迎他们。他情意深重地说：“我代表少数民族前来迎接你们回家（上山）。”同时，对教师们这种革命精神表示感谢。教师阮氏如莲的母亲也被邀请来向学员们讲话。她激动地说：“现在我是将第三个孩子献给党，第一个孩子在战争中牺牲了，第二个孩子正在保卫祖国的战线上。”她说：“在第一批到山区去工作的教师队伍中有我的女儿，我实在感到兴奋和光荣。”她还嘱咐这些远征的孩子——上山教师，要学习革命先烈的光辉榜样，和少数民族同胞紧紧团结在一起，全心全意为他们服务。学员们都表示：一定听党的话，听胡主席的话；把山区当作自己的第二故乡，把少数民族看成自己的骨肉兄弟，努力克服困难，完成党交给他们的光荣任务。
