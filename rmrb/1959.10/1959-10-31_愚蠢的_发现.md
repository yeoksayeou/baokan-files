A Stupid "Discovery"
	Just as the Soviet Union had taken photos of the far side of the moon and made them public to the world, Dr. Garring, the Portuguese representative to the United Nations, announced his astonishing astronomical "discovery" within the UN Political Committee. He said that complete disarmament would be absolutely unfeasible, because once complete disarmament occurred, mankind would only be able to use crossbows and kitchen knives to deal with "Martian invasions," which would be quite foolish.
	This doctor's imagination is even stronger than that of the American ruling clique gazing at the moon and sighing; he even has a thorough understanding of the war-mongering of the "Martians." Even more clever is that, according to the doctor, as long as mankind has not yet entered Mars, complete disarmament can be shelved indefinitely. It is conceivable that Washington will not only appreciate the doctor's hostility towards the "Martians" but will also appreciate the ingenious plan the doctor provided for opposing complete disarmament.
	However, the doctor did not realize that his advice exposed the predicament of the "Cold War" defenders: they are being forced into a corner by the huge wave of people from all countries welcoming the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals and need to resort to hostility towards "Martians" to maintain huge arms orders. In this way, the doctor is truly quite foolish.

    愚蠢的“发现”
    正当苏联摄得月球背面照片并公布于世的时候，葡萄牙驻联合国代表加灵博士却在联合国政委会内宣布了他的惊人的天文学的“发现”。他说，全面裁军是万万不行的，因为一旦全面裁军，人类就只好用弩炮和厨刀来对付“火星人的入侵，那将是颇为愚蠢的”。
    这位博士的想像力比望月兴叹的美国统治集团还要强一些，他连“火星人”的穷兵黩武都摸透了哩。更聪明的是，按照博士的说法，只要人类还未进入火星，全面裁军就可以无限期地搁置起来。可以想见，华盛顿不仅要赏识博士对“火星人”的敌视，而且更要赏识博士提供的反对全面裁军建议的妙计。
    但是，博士没有想到，他的献计却暴露了“冷战”卫士们的窘境：他们正在被各国人民欢迎苏联裁军建议的巨浪逼到了墙角，需要求助于对“火星人”的敌视，来维持庞大的军火订单。这样一来，博士才真是颇为愚蠢了。
