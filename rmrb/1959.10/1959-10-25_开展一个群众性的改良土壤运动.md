    Launch a Mass Movement to Improve Soil
    "Soil" is the first word in the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and soil improvement is a major component of that point. In order to fully implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and strive for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production next year, the vast rural areas will launch a large-scale soil improvement movement this winter and next spring. Currently, many places are actively preparing, and soil improvement movements have already begun in some areas.
    Of the nation's existing 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land, fertile and high-yielding soil accounts for approximately 500 million mu, representing 31% of the total cultivated area; moderately fertile general soil accounts for approximately 640 million mu, representing 40% of the cultivated area; various low-yielding saline-alkali land, sandy land, clay land, rotten mud fields, cold paddy fields, barren red and yellow soil, and barren mountainous land in need of soil improvement total 470 million mu, representing 29% of the cultivated area. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 200 million mu of this land has already undergone varying degrees of improvement, leaving 270 million mu of soil that needs to be vigorously improved in the future. Among the soils that have undergone preliminary improvement, approximately 100 million mu still need to be further transformed and improved. The yields of these poor soils are very low. In the north, grain yields from sandy land, saline-alkali land, albic soil, and barren mountainous land are only around 100 jin per mu, and in some cases only dozens of jin; in the south, grain yields from low-yielding paddy fields such as rotten mud fields and cold paddy fields are only 200 to 300 jin per mu. Clearly, failure to improve the soil of these low-yielding lands is detrimental to the development of agricultural production in our country and the improvement of total agricultural output, and also detrimental to the improvement of people's lives.
    Fertile soil is the foundation for obtaining high yields. On poor soil, even if the same amount of seeds, fertilizer, and labor are spent, only a lower yield can be obtained. This is because poor soil contains factors that affect soil fertility and crop growth and development, such as soil that is too sandy or too clayey, or contains saline-alkali, or is too acidic, or has poor drainage and ventilation, etc. However, these unfavorable factors can be changed by taking various measures. Local experiences have proven that once these unfavorable factors are improved, the effectiveness of measures such as fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, management, and engineering can be better utilized, creating favorable conditions for achieving a bumper harvest.
    Implementing soil improvement to increase yields is of great significance for raising the level of agricultural production in our country. However, some people lack sufficient understanding of this point and harbor doubts about the yield-increasing effect of soil improvement. They lack confidence in soil improvement and lack enthusiasm. In fact, a large number of facts have proven that yields can be increased by several times or even several times after poor soil is improved, and the yield-increasing effect is very significant. For example, the Tianjin urban area of Hebei Province (including the former Tianjin and Cangxian special districts) is a grain-deficient area with a history of severe drought and flood disasters and very low yields. Since 1955, large-scale transformation of low-lying alkaline land has been carried out, and in recent years, 3.63 million mu of low-lying alkaline land have been transformed. The transformed low-lying alkaline land generally increased production by one to three times, and planting rice increased production by five to ten times. This fundamentally changed the historically low-yielding and grain-deficient situation and greatly improved the lives of the local people. Another example is the Yulin Special District of Shaanxi, which was originally a low-yielding area with particularly severe wind and sand. Thanks to the great ideals and strong confidence of the local people and cadres in transforming nature, they have successively adopted comprehensive measures such as diverting water to pull sand, flushing sand to build land, diverting floods to irrigate land, planting trees and grass, increasing the application of organic fertilizers, and planting rice in recent years, improving a total of 4.84 million mu of sandy land and greatly increasing yields. For example, the Jinjitan area of Yulin County used to produce only 30 jin per mu, but after soil improvement, the grain yield in 1958 immediately rose to 120 to 180 jin, an increase of three to five times. In some areas, poor land is continuously improved year by year, and each improvement increases the yield-increasing effect. The 2,600 mu of sloping cultivated land in Dengjiabao, Wushan County, Gansu Province, originally had slopes generally ranging from 5 to 25 degrees. Starting in 1952, through continuous embankment building, it was transformed into gently sloping terraces, and some parts were transformed into horizontal terraces, realizing the terracing of sloping land, preventing soil erosion and loss, and gradually enriching the soil. As a result, the yield per mu increased from 80 jin in 1952 to 318 jin in 1958, an increase of nearly three times. Soil improvement not only enables originally low-yielding soil to increase production several times over, but also enables some originally medium-yielding soil to become high-yielding. For example, the Zhao Village Brigade of Xiejiazhai Commune in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, has more than 1,000 mu of clayey loess soil, which used to produce 200 jin of wheat per mu. In recent years, sand has been used to cover the soil in winter to prevent frost and improve the soil. With the combined effect of other measures, the yield per mu of wheat in 1958 was 402 jin, and this year the average yield per mu was 550 jin. These facts fully demonstrate that no matter what type of low-yielding soil it is, the yield increase is very significant after improvement. All localities should widely publicize the typical examples of significant yield increases after the improvement of various poor soils to cadres and the masses, dispel doubts about soil improvement, encourage confidence in soil improvement, and promote the mass movement for soil improvement.
    Regarding the issue of soil improvement, there is also the argument that "although soil improvement can increase production, it costs too much labor and is not worth the effort." This actually exaggerates the difficulty of soil improvement and underestimates the achievements of increasing production through soil improvement. According to materials from various localities, due to the different types of low-yielding soil and the different measures adopted, some can be improved in one go, while others require several improvements. Therefore, the yield increase in the current year can range from dozens of jin to four or five hundred jin. The labor cost of improving one mu of low-yielding soil varies depending on the type of soil and the improvement measures adopted, ranging from three to four workdays for less labor-intensive measures to thirty workdays for more labor-intensive measures, with a general average of about ten workdays. If calculated based on the benefits of the current year, it seems that one workday only yields more than a dozen jin of grain, which is not cost-effective.
    But they do not see that once the soil is improved, it can increase production year after year. Is it not worth the effort if one year of hard work brings ten thousand years of happiness? If you want to calculate the gains and losses, it should be calculated like this: the gain is increased grain production, accelerated agricultural production development, and improved people's living standards. If the more than 400 million mu of soil in the country that needs to be improved is improved, based on an increase of 200 jin to 250 jin per mu, 80 billion jin to 100 billion jin of grain can be increased annually; and what is lost? Only a low-yield label.
    "Soil improvement can significantly increase production, but our area does not have the conditions for improvement." This is another argument that lacks confidence in soil improvement. Some people emphasize the lack of material conditions for soil improvement, while others emphasize the lack of labor. Of course, due to different regions and different natural conditions, the conditions for soil improvement in various places are indeed different. For example, improving saline-alkali land is certainly easier in areas with irrigation conditions and drainage outlets than in areas without drainage and irrigation conditions. However, does this mean that saline-alkali soil cannot be improved in areas without drainage and irrigation conditions? Of course not. Many areas without drainage and irrigation conditions adopt measures such as building terraced fields, ditch-furrow fields, building dams and embankments, leveling the land, etc., to accumulate natural rainwater to leach salt, or deep plowing and padding with wheat straw, early autumn planting, late spring planting, seed soaking, increasing the application of organic fertilizers, inter-tilling, reversing hoes, pressing sand, covering grass, and so on after rain. At the same time, according to the severity of the saline-alkali content, various salt-tolerant crops and salt-tolerant green manure forage grasses are planted to rationally utilize and improve soil fertility. This can also increase production and change the low-yield situation. Dashan Commune in Junan County, Shandong Province, is a poor mountainous area with harsh conditions. However, they opened up mountains and ridges with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to transform nature. They adopted measures such as repairing terraced fields, deep plowing, leveling, cultivating soil ridges, digging drainage ditches, and thickening the soil layer with foreign soil, improving the soil. In 1958, the grain yield per mu was 503 jin, and in 1959, the average wheat yield per mu was more than 231 jin, an increase of one to two times compared to before the transformation. Jianming Commune, led by the nationally famous agricultural model worker Wang Guofan, had very barren land, but through soil improvement, production achieved continuous leaps forward and became a model of high yield in the country. These areas were not good in terms of objective conditions and had certain difficulties, but they were not intimidated by the difficulties, but actively sought ways to overcome the difficulties and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. The situation of Dashan Commune and Jianming Commune proves that as long as the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses are fully utilized, any kind of poor soil can be improved.
    The upsurge in water conservancy construction that began in 1957 has persisted, and the fertilizer accumulation movement has also been launched one after another, and deep plowing has become a regular farming system; however, soil improvement has not yet formed a movement. This is a weak link in the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter. According to the requirements of future agricultural development, a vigorous soil improvement movement must be launched. All regions should, according to local conditions, strive to complete the improvement of all 400 million mu of land that needs to be improved and continued to be improved in stages and batches within three to five years. The current situation is very conducive to carrying out the soil improvement movement. The people's communes are more consolidated and the leadership experience is richer. Under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning, encourage enthusiasm, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the vast number of commune members are full of enthusiasm and determined to strive for a continued great leap forward in agriculture next year. The soil throughout the country has been surveyed, the soil details have been clarified, and soil improvement plans have been proposed. Party committees at all levels should make full use of the current favorable situation, seize the opportunity, adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, adhere to the working method of the mass line, and focus on the following tasks: First, classify and rank all land that needs to be improved, and combine improvement and utilization based on the principles of less labor, less investment, quick results, and high returns. Adopt the method of easy first and difficult later, and carry out improvement in stages and batches. Second, make good preparations and organizational work for the labor, tools, and materials required for soil improvement; for the labor required for soil improvement, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation movement, make overall arrangements. In areas where the task of water conservancy construction is very heavy and the labor force is indeed insufficient, water conservancy construction can be carried out first, and then soil improvement. In areas where the task of water conservancy construction is light and the task of soil improvement is heavy, soil improvement can be focused on. Third, summarize the existing soil improvement experience in various places, and widely publicize and promote it. If this is done, a vigorous mass soil improvement movement can be launched this winter and next spring, laying a more reliable foundation for the continued great leap forward in agriculture next year and in the future.

    开展一个群众性的改良土壤运动
    “土”字是农业八字宪法的第一条，改良土壤又是这一条的一项主要内容。为了全面地贯彻农业八字宪法，争取明年农业生产更大的丰收，广大农村今冬明春将掀起一个大规模的改良土壤运动。目前，许多地方正在积极进行准备，部分地区的改良土壤运动已经开展起来。
    全国现有的十六亿亩耕地中，土质肥沃的高产土壤约有五亿亩，占全部耕地面积的31％；肥力中等的一般土壤约有六亿四千万亩，占耕地面积40％；各种低产的盐碱地、沙土地、粘土地、烂泥田、冷浸田、瘠薄红黄土壤和山岭瘠薄地等需要改良土壤的土地，共有四亿七千万亩，占耕地面积29％。据不完全统计，其中已经经过不同程度改良的土壤面积约二亿亩，今后需要大力进行改良的土壤面积二亿七千万亩。在已经进行初步改良的土壤中，还需要继续加以改造提高的约有一亿亩左右。这些不良土壤的产量都很低，北方的砂地、盐碱地、白浆土地、山岭薄地等低产地的粮食亩产量只有一百斤左右，有的只有几十斤；南方的烂泥田、冷浸田等低产水田，粮食亩产也只有二百至三百斤。显然，不改良这些低产土地的土壤，对我国农业生产的发展和农业总产量的提高是不利的，对人民生活的改善也是不利的。
    肥沃的土壤是获得高产的基础。而在不良的土壤上，即使花费了同样的种子、肥料和劳力，也只能获得较低的产量。这是因为不良土壤中有影响土壤肥力和作物生长发育的因素，如土壤过沙或过粘，或含有盐碱，或酸性过大，或排水和通气不良等等。但这些不利因素是可以采取各种措施来加以改变的。各地经验证明，这些不利因素一经改良，就能更好地发挥肥、水、种、密、保、管、工几项措施的作用，成为争取丰收的良好条件。
    实行改良土壤以增加产量，对于提高我国农业生产水平意义十分重大。但是，有一些人却对这一点认识不足，对改良土壤的增产作用抱着怀疑的态度，他们对改良土壤信心不足，干劲不大。其实，大量的事实已经证明，不良土壤经过改良后产量能够成倍以至数倍地增加，增产效果十分显著。例如河北省天津市区（包括原天津专区和沧县专区）是一个历史上旱涝灾害严重、产量很低的缺粮地区，自1955年开始对洼碱地进行了大规模的改造，几年来已经改造了洼碱地三百六十三万亩。经过改造的洼碱地一般增产一倍至三倍，改种水稻增产五倍至十倍。这就从根本上改变了历史上低产缺粮的面貌，大大提高了当地人民的生活。又如陕西榆林专区原是低产区，风沙特别严重，由于当地的人民和干部有改造大自然的伟大理想和坚强信心，几年来先后采用了引水拉砂、冲砂打地、引洪漫地、种树种草、增施有机肥料和种植水稻等综合措施，共改良了砂地四百八十四万亩，大大提高了产量。如榆林县金鸡滩过去亩产仅三十斤，改良土壤后，1958年粮食产量一下就上升到一百二十到一百八十斤，增加了三倍至五倍。有些地区的不良土地是逐年连续改良的，每改良一次增产效果也就增大一次。甘肃武山县邓家堡二千六百多亩坡耕地，原来坡度一般在五度至二十五度，从1952年开始，经过连年培地埂，变成了缓坡梯田，部分变成了水平梯田，实现了坡地梯田化，使水土免于冲刷和流失，土质逐渐肥沃，因此亩产量由1952年的八十斤，增加到1958年的三百一十八斤，也增产近三倍。改良土壤不仅使原来低产的土壤能成倍增产，并且能使一些原来产量中等的土壤也变成高产。如山东省青岛市谢家寨公社赵村大队一千多亩土质较粘的黄土地，过去亩产小麦二百斤，近几年冬天用砂土压砂防冻，同时改良了土壤，加上其他措施的综合作用，1958年亩产小麦四百零二斤，今年平均亩产五百五十斤。这些事实充分说明：不论是什么类型的低产土壤，经过改良，增产都很显著。各地应当把各种不良土壤经过改良后增产显著的典型事例，向干部和群众广为宣传，打破对改良土壤的怀疑，鼓舞改良土壤的信心，推动改良土壤的群众运动。
    在对待改良土壤这个问题上，还有这样一种论调：“改良土壤虽能增产，但是花费劳力太多，得不偿失”。这实际上是夸大了土壤改良的困难，低估改良土壤增产的成绩。根据各地材料来看，由于低产土壤的类型不同和采用的措施不同，有的一次可以改好，有的需要几次才能改好，因此当年的增产幅度可以由几十斤直到四、五百斤。改良一亩低产土壤的费工情况，因为土壤类型和改良措施的不同而有多有少，少的三至四个工，多的三十个工，一般平均十个工左右。假如按当年效益计算，好像是一个劳动日只换得十几斤粮食，不合算。
    但是他们没有看到土壤一经改好，就能连年增产。难道一年辛苦万年幸福，这能说是得不偿失吗？如果要算得失账，应该这样算：得的是增产了更多的粮食，加速了农业生产的发展，提高了人民生活水平。如果全国四亿亩多需要改良的土壤经过改良以后，按每亩增产二百斤至二百五十斤计算，每年即可增产粮食八百亿斤到一千亿斤；而失的呢？只是一顶低产帽子。
    “改良土壤能显著增产，但是我们地区没有条件改良。”这是对改良土壤缺乏信心的另一种论调。有的人强调没有改良土壤的物质条件，有的强调缺乏劳动力。当然，由于地区不同，自然条件也不一样，各地改良土壤的条件的确是有差别的。譬如，改良盐碱地在有灌溉条件又有排水出路的地区，当然比没有排灌条件的地区要容易一些，但是，是不是没有排灌条件的地区就不能改良盐碱土壤呢？当然不是。很多没有排灌条件的地区采取修筑台田、沟洫畦田、打埝筑埂、平整土地等措施，积蓄天然雨水淋盐，或者是深翻垫麦秸，秋早种，春晚种，浸种，增施有机肥料，雨后中耕、倒锄、压砂、盖草等等一系列的措施，同时按照盐碱分的轻重，种植各种耐盐碱作物和耐盐绿肥牧草，合理利用并提高土壤肥力，同样能够增产，能够改变低产面貌。山东省莒南县大山公社是一个穷山恶水、条件很差的山区，可是他们以愚公移山的精神开山劈岭，改造自然，采用修整梯田、深翻、整平、培土埂、挖排水沟和用客土加厚土层等等措施，改良了土壤，1958年粮食亩产五百零三斤，1959年小麦平均亩产二百三十一斤多，比改造前增产了一倍至二倍以上。全国著名的农业劳模王国藩领导的建明公社，土地非常瘠薄，通过改良土壤，产量获得了连续跃进，成为全国丰产的模范。这些地区从客观条件来说都不好，都有一定的困难，但是他们没有被困难所吓倒，而是积极想办法战胜困难，变不利条件为有利条件。大山公社和建明公社的情况证明：只要充分发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，不管是什么样的不良土壤，都是能够改好的。
    从1957年开始的兴修水利高潮已经坚持下来，积肥运动也一个接连一个地展开，深耕也已成为经常的耕作制度；但是土壤改良还没形成运动。这是实行八字宪法中的一个薄弱环节。按照今后农业发展的要求，必须掀起一个轰轰烈烈的改良土壤的运动。各个地区根据当地的具体条件，争取在三、五年之内，分期分批地把需要改良和继续改良的四亿多亩土地全部改完。目前形势非常有利于开展改良土壤运动。人民公社更加巩固，领导经验更加丰富。广大社员在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召下，个个干劲冲天，决心争取明年农业继续大跃进。全国范围内的土壤经过了普查，已经摸清了土壤底细，提出了改良土壤的方案。各级党委要充分利用当前有利形势，抓住时机，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线的工作方法，抓紧做好以下几件事：第一，把各种需要改良土壤的土地分类排队，本着花工少、投资小、收效快、收益大的原则，把改良和利用结合起来，采取先易后难的办法，分期分批地进行改良。第二，对改良土壤所需要的劳力、工具和物资，要作很好的准备工作和组织工作；对于改良土壤、兴修水利和积肥运动所需的劳力，要统筹安排，在兴修水利任务很重、劳动力确实不足的地区，可以先修水利，后改良土壤。而在兴修水利任务轻、改良土壤任务重的地区，就可以着重改良土壤。第三，要总结各地已有的改良土壤经验，广泛地宣传和推广。这样做了，今冬明春就一定可以掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的改良土壤运动，为明年和今后的农业继续大跃进打下更为可靠的基础。
