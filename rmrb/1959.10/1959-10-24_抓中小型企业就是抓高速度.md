Grasping Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Means Grasping High Speed
Wang Pu
Many of the "small-scale indigenous groups" enterprises that developed rapidly last year have evolved into "small-scale foreign groups," and they have exerted tremendous power in this year's Great Leap Forward. In September, the pig iron and coal produced by small and medium-sized enterprises other than key enterprises accounted for 51.6% and 33% of the total output, respectively; in the first half of this year, the steel output of small converters accounted for 25% of the total steel output. This proves that the Party's policy of walking on two legs is completely correct, and those who look down on small and medium-sized enterprises are completely wrong. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the products of the Great Leap Forward. The simultaneous development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises is a great creation of the Chinese people to develop our socialist construction at high speed. On the road to realizing the continued Great Leap Forward in the future, we should place small and medium-sized enterprises in a more important position. Why should the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises be placed in a more important position? That is because, in addition to the advantages of small and medium-sized enterprises in facilitating the enthusiasm of local and broad masses in running industries, facilitating the rational utilization of resources and manpower, and facilitating the rapid change of the original unreasonable industrial layout, they also have two advantages. Which two? One is fast construction. This is not to say that the construction of large enterprises cannot be fast. When the equipment supply is timely, the construction speed of large enterprises can also be very fast. Didn't the No. 2 giant open-hearth furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company take only one month from the start of construction to completion and furnace baking? This is a complete high speed. However, the technical requirements for the equipment of large enterprises are relatively high, and the construction of many large enterprises at once will also be restricted by the supply of equipment. The construction of small and medium-sized enterprises can be free from the restriction of equipment supply. These equipments can be manufactured domestically at present. Large machinery factories can manufacture them, and small and medium-sized machinery factories can also manufacture them. When modern equipment cannot be manufactured in time, indigenous methods can be used to start first, and then technical transformation can be carried out while producing. In this way, as long as there are resources and needs, it can be done by relying on the strength of the masses. Small blast furnaces, small converters, small mines, and small coal mines, whose construction time is only one year, and whose products already account for a large proportion of the total national output, have taken this road. The metallurgical industry and the coal industry can take this road, and other industries such as the chemical industry, the building materials industry, and the light industry can also take this road, and in fact they are all taking this road, and they have all achieved achievements.

The second is that production technology is easy to master. Because of the small scale of small and medium-sized enterprises, cadres can familiarize themselves with management business in a relatively short period of time. The technology of large enterprises is complex, and it takes a relatively long time for workers to fully master and familiarize themselves with the technology. The technology of small and medium-sized enterprises is relatively simple, and workers can quickly master the technology. Taking the iron and steel industry as an example, the cadres and workers who worked in the small and medium-sized iron and steel plants built last year were almost all transferred from the countryside or other posts. Most of them had never seen ironmaking and steelmaking before, and many of them could not even distinguish between iron and ore. However, after only a few months of training, they have all grown up, laymen have become experts, and novices have become veterans. In September, the average utilization coefficient of small and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide reached 0.852 tons (0.643 tons in July, 0.701 tons in August). The utilization coefficients of provinces such as Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Zhejiang have exceeded one ton. The coefficients of Hubei, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Qinghai provinces have also exceeded 0.9 tons, approaching one ton. The utilization coefficient of the best small and medium-sized blast furnaces has exceeded or approached two tons, catching up with the technical level of large blast furnaces. The quality of iron is also rapidly improving, and the cost is gradually decreasing. It is really more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, in our country where the original industrial base is relatively weak and the technical force is relatively lacking, the large-scale development of small and medium-sized enterprises can accelerate the speed of industrial development.

Talking about the benefits of small and medium-sized enterprises does not mean belittling the importance of large enterprises. Large enterprises have the benefits of large enterprises, such as high output, high efficiency, low cost, and many varieties. They are the backbone of socialist industry and one of the "two legs". They cannot be ignored at any time. Our policy is to simultaneously develop central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, and it is the whole people running industry. While vigorously developing large-scale industries, fully utilizing the characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises such as small investment, the ability to manufacture equipment by themselves, and the ability to solve technical problems relatively easily, we can use relatively large forces to develop small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to mobilize the strength of all levels across the country and involve the people of the whole country in the upsurge of industrial construction. Only in this way can we have high speed of construction.

    抓中小型企业就是抓高速度
    王朴
    去年大量发展起来的“小土群”企业，很多已发展为“小洋群”，它们在今年的大跃进中发挥了极大的威力。9月份重点企业以外的中小企业生产的生铁和煤炭，分别占全部产量的51.6％和33％；今年上半年小转炉的钢产量，已占全部钢产量的25％。这证明党的一套用两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的，而那些看不起中小型企业的观点，则是完全错误的。中小型企业是大跃进的产儿，大型企业和中小型企业并举是我国人民高速度发展我国社会主义建设的伟大创造。在实现今后继续大跃进的道路上，我们应把中小型企业摆在更重要的位置上。为什么要把中小型企业的建设摆在更重要的位置上呢？那是因为中小型企业除了具有便于发挥地方的和广大群众的办工业积极性，便于合理地利用资源和人力，便于迅速改变原来不合理的工业布局外，还具有两个优点。哪两个？一曰建设快。这并不是说大型企业的建设不能快。在设备供应及时的情况下，大型企业的建设速度也可以很快。武汉钢铁公司二号巨型平炉从动工兴建到建成烘炉，不就是只用一个月的时间吗？这是十足的高速度。但是，大型企业的设备的技术要求比较高，一下子建设很多大型企业，还会受到设备供应的限制。建设中小型企业却可以不受设备供应的限制。这些设备目前国内都能制造，大型机械工厂能造，中小型机械工厂也能造。在现代设备来不及制造的时候，还可以用土法先上马，然后一面生产，一面进行技术改造。这样，只要有资源，又有需要，就可以依靠群众的力量办起来。建设时间不过一年，现在产品在全国的总产量中已经占着很大比重的小型高炉、小型转炉、小型矿山和小型煤矿，就是走这条道路的。冶金工业、煤炭工业能够走这条道路，其他如化学工业、建筑材料工业、轻工业等也都可以走这条道路，事实上也都在走，并且都取得了成就。
    二曰生产技术容易掌握。中小型企业由于规模比较小，干部可以在比较短的时间内熟悉管理业务。大型企业的技术复杂，工人要完全掌握和熟悉技术，需要比较长的时间。中小型企业的技术比较简单，工人可以很快地掌握技术。拿钢铁工业来说，在去年兴建起来的中小型钢铁厂里工作的干部和工人，几乎全是刚从农村或者别的岗位上转来的，绝大部分人以前没见过炼铁炼钢，不少人连铁和矿石还分不清。可是只经过短短几个月的锻炼，都成长起来了，外行变成了内行，生手变成了熟手。9月份，全国中小高炉平均利用系数，已达到零点八五二吨（7月为零点六四三吨，8月为零点七零一吨），其中安徽、山东、江苏、云南、浙江等省的利用系数已经突破一吨，湖北、广东、贵州、青海等省的也超过了零点九吨，接近一吨。最好的中小高炉利用系数已经突破或者接近二吨，赶上了大高炉的技术水平。铁的质量也在迅速提高，成本在逐步降低，真是又多又快又好又省。所以，在原来工业基础比较薄弱，技术力量比较缺乏的我国，大量发展中小型企业，就可以加快工业发展的速度。
    讲了中小型企业的好处，丝毫不意味着贬低大型企业的重要性。大型企业有大型企业的好处，产量高，效率高，成本低，品种多，是社会主义工业的骨干，是“两条腿”中的一条，任何时候都是不能忽视的。我们的方针是中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产并举，是全民办工业。在大力发展大型工业的同时，充分利用中小型企业投资小、能够自己制造设备、能够比较容易解决技术问题的特点，用比较大的力量来发展中小型企业，才能把全国各级力量都动员起来，把全国人民都卷进工业建设的高潮里来。这样才有建设的高速度。
