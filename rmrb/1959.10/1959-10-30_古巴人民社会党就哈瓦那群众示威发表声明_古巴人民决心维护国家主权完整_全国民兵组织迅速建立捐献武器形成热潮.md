Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th – The Executive Bureau of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a statement on the million-strong mass demonstration held in Havana on the 26th.

The statement said that the conference demonstrated the people's determination to safeguard the integrity of national sovereignty, defend Cuba and resist the attacks of imperialists and counter-revolutionaries; support the advancement of land reform, national industrialization and the entire revolutionary cause; support the new revolutionary laws; support military training for workers and peasants; and approve the restoration of revolutionary courts to impose the death penalty on terrorists, pilots who carry out air raids on our territory, and traitors like Matos who conspire against the revolutionary regime, against the people, and against the motherland.

The statement emphasized the huge scale of the meeting, saying that the conference showed foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries that their threats, propaganda and rebellion carried out "under the guise of a decadent anti-communist banner" cannot shake the people's support for the revolutionary regime.

The statement pointed out that this conference "is the response of the revolution, the revolutionary government, and the people." "The enemies of the revolution carry out evil and rebellious activities, and the revolutionary government will impose severe and merciless sanctions on them to cut off the claws of criminals and traitors."

The statement concluded by stating that the Cuban People's Socialist Party will fully support the oath of all the Cuban people.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th – A movement to donate funds to purchase national defense weapons and organize militias is underway across Cuba to crush counter-revolutionary offensives from home and abroad.

The donation movement has rapidly spread to factories, shops, schools and government agencies. Responding to the call of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, workers in the public works area of Pinar del Río Province, radio station employees, school teachers, and office staff have already donated a day's wages. The Las Villas Province Workers' Federation has raised more than 20,000 pesos. The forty-six trade union organizations in Santa Clara, the capital of Las Villas Province, decided that their members would donate one day's wages to purchase aircraft, and the General Secretary of the National Sugar Workers' Federation announced that all sugar workers would donate one day's wages. Many factory workers, shop employees, transport workers, and insurance company employees have made the same decision.

The first National Congress of Dealers and Distributors, attended by four hundred representatives in Matanzas, also decided that each agent would donate five pesos.

In order to further promote the donation movement, offices to oversee fundraising are being established all over the country.

At the same time, the Cuban people are accelerating the organization of militias to defend Cuba and the revolution.

More than four hundred students from the National University of Havana joined the "José Antonio Echeverría Student Force" yesterday. The Tobacco Harvesters Association supports the government's decision to train workers and peasants and announced that thousands of tobacco harvesters will join the militia. Conrado Becquer, General Secretary of the National Sugar Workers' Federation, announced that Cuba's two hundred and thirty-three sugar trade unions are prepared to establish worker militias to defend the revolution. Workers from many factories, as well as organizations such as the Cuban Lions Club and the Las Villas University Student Federation, have requested to be organized quickly for military training.
