Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: Premier Zhou Enlai held a reception tonight to welcome Mr. Matsumura Kenzo, advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, and his entourage.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the reception. He said that Mr. Matsumura Kenzo is visiting China following Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi. Mr. Matsumura, like Mr. Ishibashi, advocates that the people of China and Japan should join hands and work together for peace in the Far East and the world, and for promoting friendly relations between the people of China and Japan. We hope that Mr. Matsumura will stay in China for a longer period of time this time, talk more with friends from all aspects of China, and visit various aspects and places, so that he can better understand the New China and thus contribute more to the friendship between our two peoples and to the contribution of the two peoples to peace in the Far East and the world.

　　Premier Zhou said that recently, many Japanese friends have come to China. After Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi's visit to China, the Japanese Communist Party delegation came to China to participate in our 10th anniversary celebration of the founding of the country, and the Japanese delegation from all walks of life, headed by Tetsu Katayama, composed of more than 70 Japanese non-governmental organizations, also came to China to participate in the National Day celebration and visit. Now, Mr. Matsumura Kenzo has come to China again, and we are very happy. Frequent exchanges between the people of China and Japan are a matter of congratulation.

　　Premier Zhou finally raised his glass to congratulate the growing friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and to wish Mr. Matsumura Kenzo and his party good health and a smooth journey.

　　Matsumura Kenzo then delivered a speech at the reception, thanking Premier Zhou for holding a grand welcome reception for him. He said that we are very happy and honored to meet and exchange views with Premier Zhou and influential people from all walks of life. He said that for several years, he had been hoping to visit China and have direct talks with Premier Zhou. Now that this wish has finally come true, he is very happy.

　　Matsumura Kenzo said: "Unfortunately, many problems have occurred between Japan and China in the past, which we deeply regret. The past war caused great losses to your country. Today, I can say that no one in Japan wants to repeat the mistakes of the past. Japan should survive in a peaceful environment along with the prosperity of Asia. The Japanese people are willing to take the road of peace, and I would like to express this wish on behalf of the Japanese people."

　　Matsumura Kenzo expressed his utmost joy at the Chinese government's support for the Soviet government's new proposal on complete and thorough disarmament. He said that Japan should do its best to keep up with the world's peace trend.

　　Speaking of the Chinese people's great economic construction, Matsumura Kenzo said: "The Chinese people have stood up. The great construction carried out by the Chinese people is a historical miracle. I hope that the state of peace can continue. If this is the case, the great construction carried out by China in 20 to 30 years will change the history of the world."

　　Matsumura Kenzo finally said that he has various purposes for visiting China this time. First, he hopes to exchange views with people from all walks of life in China. Second, he wants to see the great construction of New China and also see the ancient cultural relics of China. He also said that as an old sinologist, he hopes to visit famous mountains and rivers; as someone who has worked in agriculture and education for many years, he hopes to understand China's agriculture and cultural education. He said, in a word, through this visit, he hopes to achieve genuine understanding and friendship between the two sides.

    中日人民并肩保卫和平
    松村谦三说：日本应该跟上世界的和平潮流
    新华社21日讯　周恩来总理今晚举行酒会，欢迎日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三先生及其随行人员。
    周恩来总理在酒会上首先致词。他说，松村谦三先生是继石桥湛山先生之后到中国来访问的。松村先生同石桥先生一样，都主张中日两国人民应该携起手来，共同为远东和世界和平，共同为促进中日两国人民的友好关系而努力。我们希望松村先生这次到中国来能多留一些时间，多同中国各方面的朋友谈一谈，多到各个方面各个地方去看一看，这样就可以更好地了解新中国，从而更有助于我们两国人民的友好，有助于两国人民为远东和世界和平作出自己的贡献。
    周总理说，最近，日本朋友到中国来的很多。在石桥湛山先生访问中国之后，日本共产党代表团到中国来参加了我们的建国十周年庆祝典礼，由日本七十多个民间团体组成的、以片山哲为首的日本各界代表团，也来中国参加国庆典礼和访问。现在，松村谦三先生接着又来到中国，我们感到很高兴。中日两国人民的来往频繁起来，这是一件值得庆贺的事情。
    周总理最后举杯，祝贺中日两国人民的友好关系日益发展，祝贺松村谦三先生及其一行人的身体健康和旅行顺利。
    松村谦三接着在酒会上致词，感谢周总理为他举行盛大的欢迎酒会。他说，我们能同周总理和各方面有影响的人士见面并交换意见，感到非常高兴和光荣。他说，几年来，他一直希望访问中国并同周总理进行直接的交谈，现在这个愿望终于实现了，他感到非常高兴。
    松村谦三说：“日中两国之间过去不幸发生了许多问题，这使我们深为遗憾。过去的战争使贵国遭到很大损失，今天，我可以说，日本没有一个人愿意再重复过去的错误。日本应当在和平的环境中随着亚洲的繁荣而生存下去，日本人民愿意走和平的道路，我愿意代表日本人民表达这种愿望。”
    松村谦三对中国政府支持苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的新建议表示最大的喜悦。他说，日本应该竭尽全力，跟上世界的和平潮流。
    在谈到中国人民的巨大经济建设时，松村谦三说：“中国人民站起来了，中国人民所进行的巨大建设是历史的奇迹，希望和平状态能持续下去，这样的话，在二、三十年后，中国所进行的巨大建设将改变世界的历史。”
    松村谦三最后说，他这次访问中国抱有多种目的。他首先希望能同中国各方面的人士交换意见，其次是既要看一看新中国的巨大建设，同时也看一看中国的古代文物。他还说，作为一个老汉学家，他希望游览名山大川；作为一个多年做过农业工作和教育工作的人，他希望了解中国的农业和文化教育工作。他说，总之一句话，通过这次访问，希望能够达到双方真正的理解和亲善。
    出席今晚酒会的，有各有关部门、各人民团体的负责人和各界人士郭沫若、廖承志、刘宁一、张奚若、蔡廷锴、王震、章汉夫、雷任民、胡愈之、李烛尘、楚图南、许广平、王昆仑、侯德榜、阳翰笙、连贯、吴克坚、刘西元、赵朴初、杨煜、欧阳予倩、梅兰芳、吴茂荪、周培源、谢冰心、谢南光、区棠亮、林士笑、萧方洲、丁拓等。
