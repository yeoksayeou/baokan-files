　　Fortnightly International Review
　　(October 1 to 15)
	Socialist Countries Full of Joyful Events
	The first half of October has been filled with joyful events for the socialist countries.

	In the first week of this month, both China and the German Democratic Republic celebrated the tenth anniversary of their founding. In just ten years, these two newly born countries have grown tremendously, becoming bulwarks of peace in Asia and Europe; socialism has blossomed everywhere on the land of these two countries. The development of these two countries over the past ten years has added tremendous strength to the socialist camp and the cause of world peace. History has proven how brilliant a cause the liberated people, under the leadership of the working-class party, can achieve by advancing along the path of the great October Revolution!

	On the 4th, the Soviet Union successfully launched its third cosmic rocket, sending out an automatic interplanetary station. In just two short years, the Soviet Union has successively launched three giant artificial earth satellites, offered an artificial planet to the solar system, sent another cosmic rocket to the lunar palace, and made the third cosmic rocket orbit the earth after passing the moon. These are earth-shattering events in human history! These artificial satellites and cosmic rockets have not only collected extremely valuable scientific data about outer space for mankind, opening up the path for human interstellar travel, but have also carried the glorious Soviet flag—the flag of socialism—to space and the moon, showing the unparalleled superiority of socialism to all mankind, making capitalism pale in comparison!

	Another joyful event for the socialist camp is that many countries have successively formulated plans to accelerate the construction of socialism. The German Democratic Republic passed the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 on the 1st; at the same time, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have also recently formulated new five-year plans. The main feature of these new plans is that the speed of construction has been greatly accelerated compared to the past. The seven-year plan of the German Democratic Republic stipulates that between 1958 and 1965, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 88%, and agriculture and animal husbandry will also increase significantly, and the actual wages of workers and staff will increase by 60% to 65%. Between 1958 and 1965, Czechoslovakia's industrial output will increase by 101.3%, basic construction will increase by about 80%, and agricultural output will increase by about 40%. During Hungary's second five-year plan (1961-1965), industrial production will increase by 65% to 70% compared to 1958, the average agricultural output will increase by 30% to 32% compared to the average output of 1954-1958, and national income will increase by at least 50%. The rapid economic development of socialist countries will not only enable socialism to achieve final victory in the peaceful competition with capitalism, but also have a significant impact on the future international situation.

	The United States Creates Tension in Asia
	Recently, the United States has been creating tension in many parts of the world, especially in Asia.

	First of all, in the Far East, the US aggressive bloc openly declared that it would continue to implement an aggressive policy hostile to the Chinese people. In a speech on "U.S. Policy toward the Far East" on October 7, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon completely inherited Dulles' mantle, saying that the Chinese people's determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan was "aggression," and shamelessly threatened the Chinese people, saying that if China were to liberate its territory of Taiwan, there would be "the danger of dragging the whole world into a full-scale war." On October 8, the U.S. State Department publicly violated the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, which the United States had signed, and declared that Taiwan was not part of Chinese territory. The "New York Times" bluntly admitted that the U.S. policy toward China "has not changed." This means that the United States will continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan by force, insist on interfering in China's internal affairs, and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their territory of Taiwan.

	At the same time, the US imperialists have recently cranked up the propaganda machine and frantically attacked the Chinese people's socialist construction, and manipulated the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. Under the instigation of the United States, the Irish and Malayan delegations submitted an absurd proposal to the current UN General Assembly requesting the United Nations to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue." Later, under the manipulation of the United States, the General Committee of the UN General Assembly brazenly violated the UN Charter and illegally decided to include the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the agenda. Fair-minded public opinion in various countries around the world pointed out that the United States' despicable act of wantonly slandering China and interfering in China's internal affairs in the United Nations shows that the United States continues to try to use the old trick of the "Cold War" to obstruct the international situation from moving towards genuine detente.

	In Indochina, the United States continues to ship war materials and military personnel into Laos in an endless stream, while continuing to use the United Nations and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to interfere in the affairs of Laos. The ugly farce of the so-called "Subcommittee" of the United Nations to investigate the situation in Laos, directed by the United States, was declared over on October 10. Although the United States instigated the Lao Sananikone clique to try its best to fabricate so-called "evidence" of the "aggression" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in order to facilitate the United States' further armed intervention in Laos, this conspiracy of the United States could not but suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the facts. Even the British "Daily Express" believed in an article published on October 6 that since the "United Nations Investigation Team" could not produce any reliable "evidence," it merely staged an ugly "comic opera" for the whole world. However, the US imperialists are not reconciled to their failure and still attempt to play tricks to keep the personnel of this UN "Subcommittee" in Laos indefinitely, to serve as a criminal tool for the United States to interfere in Laos and undermine peace in Indochina.

	In the Middle East, the United States gathered Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and other countries to hold the first meeting of the Central Treaty Organization Council in Washington from October 7 to 9. The Central Treaty Organization is the revival of the notorious Baghdad Treaty Organization that has been shattered by the Iraqi people, and is a criminal tool used by the United States to threaten the peace and independence of the Middle East and Arab countries. The Washington meeting of the Central Treaty Organization discussed the establishment of a "Permanent Military Representative Group" and a unified command. U.S. Vice President Nixon vigorously advocated pursuing a military bloc policy at the meeting, clamoring that the aggressive blocs under U.S. control could not "relax their efforts," and the communique issued at the meeting even advocated "maintaining strength," requiring its member states to follow the U.S. policy of arms expansion and war preparation.

	At the same time, according to a report in the "New York Times" on October 11, the negotiations between the United States and Turkey on the construction of missile bases have ended, and the United States will build medium-range missile bases on Turkish territory. The "New York Times" said in a bellicose tone that this medium-range missile "can be equipped with nuclear warheads, and its range is one thousand five hundred miles. From bases in Turkey, this missile can reach any stronghold in the European part of the Soviet Union and most parts of Central Asia."

	These "Cold War" and arms expansion and war preparation activities of the United States are taking place at a time when the peace-loving people of all countries in the world are eager to ease international tensions, which cannot but arouse people's vigilance.

	What Does the British Election Reflect?
	The British House of Commons election has come to an end, and the Conservative Party has won a majority of seats and continues to govern.

	This kind of "election" by the British bourgeois ruling group as usual is originally not worth paying attention to. Anyway, things have been arranged so that either the Conservative Party comes to power or the Labour Party comes to power, and there is no difference in essence between these two parties in serving the British monopoly capitalist group.

	In the process of the election campaign, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party attacked each other for being unable to eliminate the threat of poverty, unemployment, and inflation, and each offered empty promises to improve the living standards of the British people. The ruling Conservative Party was able to win a majority of votes to a considerable extent because of the recent artificial "recovery" in certain sectors of the British economy. The Conservative Party used this temporary, partial, and false "prosperity" to confuse voters. However, winning votes is one thing, and whether or not it can solve Britain's deteriorating economic problems is another.

	Another feature of this election struggle is that both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party boasted of their "achievements" in promoting the easing of the international situation in the process of the election campaign, and both expressed their advocacy for convening a summit meeting of the major powers of the East and the West. This reflects how strong the desire of the British people is to end the "Cold War" and maintain world peace. The British people will undoubtedly pay attention to how the Conservative government will realize its election promises to promote the easing of the international situation in its future actual actions. This will be a constant pressure on the Macmillan government that continues to govern.

	The Labour Party's failure in the election is not accidental. In fact, the Labour Party's program has no fundamental difference from the Conservative Party. On domestic economic issues, it has abandoned even the purely superficial "nationalization" policy; on the issue of the interests of the working class, it has adopted a "class conciliation" policy, and like the Conservative Party, it maintains the interests of the monopoly capitalist group; in foreign policy, it also adheres to the "Atlantic policy" like the Conservative Party. Because of this, the Labour Party cannot win the majority of votes from the Conservative Party to its side. The Labour Party's failure reflects that the reformist ideas of "socialism" advocated by the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group are increasingly unpopular in Britain. Bevan, one of the Labour Party leaders, said: "The idea that the Labour Party's failure is the collapse of British socialism has no factual basis." This is absolutely right, but it needs to be supplemented. True socialism in Britain will never collapse, but all kinds of counterfeit "socialism" will definitely collapse. The reactionary domestic and foreign policies advocated by the Conservative Party and the Labour Party will inevitably run into more and more obstacles, and the influence of the true socialist forces representing the interests of the British people will eventually expand day by day.

　　半月国际述评
　　（10月1日至15日）
    社会主义国家喜事重重
    10月上半月，社会主义国家喜事重重。
    在这个月的头一个星期中，我国和德意志民主共和国都欢庆了自己的建国十周年。仅仅十年的时间，这两个新生的国家就已经大大成长起来，成为亚洲和欧洲的和平堡垒；社会主义已经在这两个国家的土地上遍地开花。这两个国家十年来的发展，已经给社会主义阵营和世界和平事业增添了巨大的力量。历史已经证明，获得了解放的人民，在工人阶级政党的领导下，沿着伟大十月革命的道路前进，能够做出多么辉煌的事业！
    4日，苏联又成功地发射了第三支宇宙火箭，送出了自动行星际站。在短短的两年中，苏联就接连发射了三个巨大的人造地球卫星，给太阳系献上一个人造行星，把另一支宇宙火箭送进月宫，并且使第三支宇宙火箭绕过月球而围绕地球运行。这是人类历史上惊天动地的事件！这些人造卫星和宇宙火箭，不仅给人类搜集了宇宙空间极其宝贵的科学资料，打开了人类星际旅行的道路；而且把光辉的苏联旗帜——社会主义的旗帜带到太空和月球上去，向全人类显示了社会主义的无比的优越性，使资本主义暗然失色了！
    社会主义阵营的另一件喜事，是许多国家纷纷制订加速建设社会主义的计划。德意志民主共和国在1日通过了1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划；同时，最近捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利也制订了新的五年计划。这些新的计划的主要特点，是建设的速度比过去大大地加快了。德意志民主共和国七年计划规定，1958—1965年间，德意志民主共和国工业生产将增加88％，农业和畜牧业也将大大增加，职工实际工资将增加60％到65％。1958—1965年间，捷克斯洛伐克的工业产量将增加101.3％，基本建设将约增加80％，农业产量将约增加40％。匈牙利在第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，工业生产将比1958年增加65％到70％，农业平均生产量将比1954—1958年的平均产量增加30％到32％，国民收入至少要增加50％。社会主义阵营各国经济的迅速发展，不仅将使社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛中获得最终的胜利，而且对今后的国际形势具有重大的影响。
    美国在亚洲制造紧张局势
    最近以来，美国在世界许多地方，特别是在亚洲制造紧张局势。
    首先在远东，美国侵略集团公开声言继续执行敌视中国人民的侵略政策。美国副国务卿狄龙在10月7日发表的一篇关于“美国对远东政策”的演说中完全继承杜勒斯的衣钵，说什么中国人民决心解放自己的领土台湾就是“进行侵略”，并且无耻地恫吓中国人民说：如果中国要解放自己的领土台湾，那就有“把全世界卷入全面战争的危险”。美国国务院在10月8日竟公然违背美国所签字的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，声明否认台湾是中国领土的一部分。“纽约时报”露骨地承认，美国对中国的政策“没有改变”。这就是说，美国将继续用武力霸占中国的领土台湾，并坚持干涉中国内政，阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。
    与此同时，美帝国主义者最近开足宣传机器的马力，疯狂地攻击中国人民的社会主义建设事业，并操纵联合国干涉中国内政。在美国的指使下，爱尔兰和马来亚代表团向本届联合国大会提出了一项要求联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”的荒谬提案，而后，在美国操纵下，联合国大会总务委员会竟悍然违反联合国宪章，非法决定把所谓“西藏问题”列入议程。世界各国公正舆论指出，美国在联合国大肆污蔑中国和干涉中国内政的卑劣勾当，表明了美国继续力图以“冷战”故技来阻挠国际局势走向真正的缓和。
    在印度支那，美国一面仍源源不绝地把作战物资和军事人员运入老挝，一面则继续利用联合国和东南亚侵略集团干涉老挝的事务。美国导演的所谓联合国调查老挝局势“小组委员会”在老挝进行罪恶活动的这幕丑剧，已于10月10日宣布结束。虽然美国唆使老挝萨纳尼空集团竭力捏造所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”的“证据”，以便于美国进一步对老挝实行武装干涉，但美国的这个阴谋不能不在事实面前遭到可耻的失败。就连英国的“每日快报”在10月6日发表的文章中也认为由于“联合国调查团”提不出什么可靠的“证据”来，因此只不过向全世界演出了一出丑恶的“滑稽歌剧”。然而，美帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，仍然企图玩弄花招，把这个联合国“小组委员会”人员无限期留在老挝，以充当美国干涉老挝和破坏印度支那和平的罪恶工具。
    在中近东，美国纠集了土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦等国家从10月7日至9日在华盛顿举行了中央条约组织理事会的第一次会议。中央条约组织是已经被伊拉克人民打碎了的臭名昭著的巴格达条约组织的死灰复燃，是美国用来威胁中东和阿拉伯各国和平与独立的罪恶工具。这次中央条约组织的华盛顿会议，讨论了成立“常设军事代表小组”和统一的司令部的问题。美国副总统尼克松在会议上大力鼓吹奉行军事集团政策，叫嚷美国控制下的各侵略集团不能“放松努力”，会议发表的公报更鼓吹“保持力量”，要求它的成员国追随美国的扩军备战政策。
    与此同时，据“纽约时报”10月11日报道，美国和土耳其关于修建导弹基地的谈判已经结束，美国将要在土耳其的领土上修建中程导弹基地。“纽约时报”带着好战的口吻说，这种中程导弹“能够配备核弹头，它的射程是一千五百英里。从土耳其的基地，这种导弹能够射到苏联欧洲部分和中亚大部分地区的任何据点。”
    美国的这些“冷战”和扩军备战的活动，正发生在全世界爱好和平的各国人民渴望缓和国际紧张局势的时候，这不能不引起人们的警惕。
    英国选举反映了什么
    英国下院的选举已告结束，保守党获得过半数的议席，继续执政。
    英国资产阶级统治集团照例的这种“选举”其本身原是不足重视的，反正事情已经被安排成不是保守党上台就是工党上台，而这两党在为英国垄断资本集团服务本质上是并无区别的。
  保守党和工党在竞选的过程中，互相攻讦对方无力消除贫困、失业和通货膨胀的威胁，各自开出提高英国人民生活水平的空头支票。执政的保守党所以能骗得多数选票，在相当大的程度上是由于近来英国某些经济部门出现了人为的“回升”，保守党就利用这种暂时的、局部的、虚伪的“繁荣”来迷惑选民。但是，骗得了选票是一回事，能不能解决英国的日益恶化的经济问题又是另一回事。
    这次选举斗争的另一个特点是，保守党和工党在竞选的过程中，都吹嘘自己在促进国际局势的缓和方面的“功绩”，都表示主张召开东西方大国首脑会议。这反映了英国人民要求结束“冷战”和维护世界和平的愿望是何等强烈。英国人民无疑地将注视保守党政府究竟如何在今后的实际行动中实现它的关于促进国际局势缓和的竞选诺言。这对继续执政的麦克米伦政府将是一个经常存在的压力。
    工党在选举中的失败，不是偶然的。事实上，工党的政纲同保守党并无原则区别。它在国内经济问题上，连纯属表面文章的“国有化”政策都放弃了；在对待工人阶级的利益问题上，它采取了“阶级调和”政策，同保守党一样维护垄断资本集团的利益；在外交政策上，也同保守党一样坚持“大西洋政策”。正因为如此，工党就不可能把多数选票从保守党那里争取到自己这方面来。工党的失败，反映了工党右翼领导集团所鼓吹的“社会主义”的改良主义思想在英国已日益不得人心。工党领导人之一比万说：“认为工党的失败是英国社会主义的垮台的说法是没有事实根据的”。这话说得完全对，但是需要给以补充。英国真正的社会主义是永远不会垮台的，而形形色色的冒牌的“社会主义”却肯定是要垮台的。保守党和工党所主张的反动的国内外政策必将日益碰壁，而代表英国人民利益的真正的社会主义力量的影响，终将一天天扩大起来。
