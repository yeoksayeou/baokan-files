Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: Comrade He Long, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, delivered the closing speech at the First National Games. The full text is as follows:

Comrades!

The First National Games, held to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, has now come to a successful conclusion. These Games were held under the close attention of our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Party and the State. With the active support of all relevant parties and the broad masses, and the joint efforts of all personnel, the Games were very successful, implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee, and were a victorious and united gathering! Sports delegations from fraternal countries, headed by the Soviet Union, and friends from other countries also participated in this conference and celebrated the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China with us. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to them.

This Games is a great review of sports in our country, and is a large-scale, content-rich, and high-achieving sports event. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels across the country, all athletes were full of fighting spirit and energy, and created many outstanding achievements. Seven athletes broke four world records in swimming, parachuting, shooting, and model aviation. Six hundred and sixty-four people broke national records eight hundred and forty-four times in one hundred and six events including swimming, track and field, and shooting. These achievements exceeded the total number of records broken in the entire year of 1958. The highest records of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions were broken more than two thousand times. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest on the sports front, and also a concentrated manifestation of the leap in technical level of sports in our country on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. A large number of new forces have also gathered at this National Games. Among the more than 10,000 athletes, 46% were newcomers participating in national competitions for the first time, and many of them have achieved very gratifying results. For example, the three athletes who broke the women's parachuting world record had been learning to parachute for less than a year. The level of various ball games has generally improved, a large number of newcomers and veterans are close in strength, and the competition is very fierce. This reflects the vigorous scene of new people emerging in sports teams in our country, with a hundred flowers blooming, all colors vying for beauty, and flourishing prosperity.

In various competitions, the athletes demonstrated the communist style of exerting full effort, striving for the top, unity and friendship, mutual cooperation, not being arrogant in victory, and not being discouraged in defeat, and excellent moral qualities. Many teams were able to maintain full enthusiasm and confidence in the face of setbacks, and finally achieved the final victory. Many newcomers were able to break superstitions, liberate their minds, dare to think, dare to act, and strive for victory. These have deeply educated the athletes, and further made them realize that in the sports field, they must not only compete in skills, but also in politics; not only in physical strength, but also in courage, wit, and strong will. Athletes and referees regard the National Games not only as a competition arena for the communist style of striving for the top, but also as a large classroom for mutual learning and common improvement. Whether in competitions or in technical report meetings and experience exchange meetings, the spirit of humbly learning was implemented, enabling all athletes, coaches, and referees to achieve a double harvest in thought and technology.

The emergence of these achievements is another brilliant victory of the Party's General Line on the sports front; it is the result of relying on the leadership of the Party, implementing political command, implementing the policy of sports serving production and national defense, and extensively carrying out mass sports activities in sports work. This Games has also received the attention, care and encouragement of the people of the whole country. Hundreds of thousands of people visited the various competitions of the National Games. All employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company challenged the athletes with the production achievement of breaking the daily output of 2,100 tons of steel. Workers, peasants, students, and soldiers from all over the country organized competitions and actively participated in exercises to congratulate the conference. This greatly encouraged the morale of the athletes, enabling all athletes to work hard with full confidence to create new achievements.

All sports workers and athletes, I hope you will earnestly summarize the experience of this Games, continue to carry forward the communist spirit, and strive to improve your ideological awareness and technical level, and strive to become the most outstanding people's athletes and referees, so as to better serve production and construction and national defense. Athletes! You shoulder an important responsibility in developing sports in our country. I hope that while improving your skills and constantly creating new records, you will actively organize and lead the masses to participate in physical exercises and help them improve their sports skills; you must not only become excellent athletes, but also become propagandists and technical instructors of sports, and promote the sports cause of our people to a more glorious new stage.

Comrades, let us unite closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and together with the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of the whole country, hold high the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, oppose Rightism, boost our energy, and advance bravely along the road of the Great Leap Forward, from victory to greater victory.
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the General Line!

Long live the Great leap forward!
Long live the People's Commune!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people of all nationalities, Chairman Mao!

    党的总路线在体育战线上的辉煌胜利
    贺龙副总理在第一届全国运动会上的闭幕词
    新华社3日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理、国家体育运动委员会主任贺龙在第一届全国运动会上致闭幕词，全文如下：
    同志们！
    为了庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年举行的第一届全国运动会，现在胜利的闭幕了。这次运动会，是在我国各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席及党和国家领导同志的亲切关怀下进行的。在各有关方面和广大群众的积极支持和全体人员的共同努力下，使这次运动会开得很好，执行了党中央的指示，是一次胜利的、团结的大会！这次大会还有以苏联为首的兄弟国家体育代表团和其他国家的朋友们参加，并和我们一起欢度了建国十周年的伟大节日，谨向他们表示衷心的感谢。
    这次运动会，是我国体育运动的大检阅，是一次规模宏大，内容丰富，成绩优良的运动会。全体运动员在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，在全国各级党委的正确领导下，个个斗志昂扬，干劲十足，创造了许多优异成绩。有七名运动员打破游泳、跳伞、射击、航空模型等四项世界纪录。有六百六十四人，八百四十四次打破游泳、田径、射击等一百零六个单项的全国纪录，这些成绩超过了1958年全年破纪录的总和。打破各省、市、自治区的最高纪录，就有两千多次，这是体育战线上一次空前的大丰收，也是我国体育运动在1958年大跃进的基础上，技术水平飞跃提高的集中表现。这次全运会运动员中，还汇集了大批的新生力量。在一万多名运动员中，有46％的人是第一次参加全国比赛的新手，其中许多人都取得了十分可喜的成就。如打破女子跳伞世界纪录的三名运动员，学习跳伞还不到一年。各项球类水平普遍提高，大批新手老将实力接近，比赛争夺十分激烈。这反映出我国体育队伍中新人辈出，百花齐放，万紫千红，欣欣向荣的蓬勃景象。
    在各项竞赛中，运动员们表现了鼓足干劲，力争上游，团结友爱，互相协作，胜不骄、败不馁的共产主义风格，和优良的道德品质。许多球队在失利的情况下，仍能情绪饱满，信心百倍地坚持奋战，终于取得了最后的胜利，许多新手都能破除迷信，解放思想，敢想、敢干，力争胜利。这些都使运动员们受到了深刻的教育，进一步认识到，在运动场上不仅要比技术，还要比政治；不仅要比体力，还要比勇敢、机智，比意志坚强，运动员和裁判员，不仅把全运会当作力争上游的共产主义风格的比武场，还当作互相学习，共同提高的大课堂。无论是在比赛中，或在技术报告会、经验交流会中，都贯彻了虚心学习的精神，使全体运动员、教练员、裁判员在思想和技术上都获得了双丰收。
    这些成绩的出现，是党的总路线在体育战线上又一次辉煌的胜利；是在体育工作中，依靠党的领导，实现政治挂帅，贯彻体育为生产、为国防服务的方针，广泛开展群众性体育运动的结果。这次运动会，也受到全国人民的重视、关怀和鼓励，上百万人参观了全运会的各项比赛。重庆钢铁公司的全体职工，用突破日产两千一百吨钢的生产成绩向运动员挑战。各地工人、农民、学生、部队官兵纷纷组织竞赛，积极参加锻炼向大会祝贺。这大大鼓舞了运动员的斗志，使全体运动员们信心百倍地努力创造新成绩。
    全体体育工作者和运动员同志们，希望你们认真总结这次运动会的经验，继续发扬共产主义精神，努力提高自己的思想觉悟和技术水平，争取成为最优秀的人民运动员和裁判员，以便更好地为生产建设和国防服务。运动员同志们！在发展我国体育运动中，你们担负着重要的责任。希望你们在提高技术，不断创造新纪录的同时，积极组织和带动广大群众参加体育锻炼，帮助他们提高运动技术水平；你们不仅要成为优秀的运动员，而且要成为体育运动的宣传员和技术指导员，把我国人民体育事业，推向一个更加光辉的新阶段。
    同志们：让我们紧紧地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，和全国的工人、农民、革命知识分子在一起，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，反右倾、鼓干劲，沿着大跃进的道路，奋勇前进，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    总路线万岁！
    大跃进万岁！
    人民公社万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
