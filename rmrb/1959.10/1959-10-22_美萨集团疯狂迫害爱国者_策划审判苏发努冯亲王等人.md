Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 21st: Vientiane News: The Lao Ministry of Justice announced on the 20th that Prince Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front will be tried in the Vientiane court on October 26th.

　　When the Sananikone government launched a civil war this year under the instigation of the United States, it illegally arrested eight leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front headed by Prince Souphanouvong on July 28th. Now the United States and the Sananikone group are conspiring to further persecute them.

　　Lao Deputy Minister of Justice Dan Chulamontri said that the "charges" against the eight leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front will be read out during the trial. However, American news agencies have already revealed that they will be charged with "conspiracy to commit treason."

　　In commenting on the illegal trial of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, the "Lao Patriotic News" pointed out that this is a new crime of rudely violating the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

　　"Lao Patriotic News" also pointed out that the Lao authorities' illegal acts of arresting Lao patriots have already caused a wave of anger in Lao and world public opinion, and now they are preparing to illegally try these patriotic fighters, which will inevitably arouse even greater anger in world public opinion.

    美萨集团疯狂迫害爱国者
    策划审判苏发努冯亲王等人
    新华社河内21日电　万象消息：老挝司法部20日宣布，苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他七位领导人将在10月26日在万象法庭受审判。
    萨纳尼空政府今年在美国唆使下发动内战时，在7月28日非法逮捕了以苏发努冯亲王为首的八位老挝爱国战线党领袖。现在美国和萨纳尼空集团阴谋进一步迫害他们。
    老挝司法副大臣丹·朱拉蒙滴说，对老挝爱国战线党这八位领导人控告的“罪名”将在审判时宣读。但是，美国的通讯社已经透露，他们将被扣上“阴谋叛国”的“罪名”。
    “老挝爱国报”在评论非法审讯老挝爱国战线党领袖这件事时指出，这是粗暴地违反日内瓦协议和万象协议的新罪行。
    “老挝爱国报”还指出，老挝当局逮捕老挝爱国人士的非法行为已经在老挝和世界舆论中造成愤怒浪潮，现在他们又准备非法审讯这些爱国志士，这必将激起世界舆论更大的愤怒。
