    Red Flag Store on a Ten-Thousand-Ton Mine
    —Introducing the Tongjialiang Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province
    The Tongjialiang Store in Kouquan District, Datong City, Shanxi Province, includes a shopping mall, three comprehensive retail departments, two vegetable retail departments, two small canteens, and a sewing department. It has a total of 132 employees and is responsible for the supply of more than 19,000 employees and residents in the Tongjialiang mining area. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the higher-level Party and government, the employees of the Tongjialiang Store improved the supply work in many ways, powerfully supported the Great Leap Forward in coal mine production, and were warmly welcomed by factory and mine units and the masses of residents, finding the correct direction for commercial work in industrial and mining areas. In the continued leap forward of 1959, the employees of the Tongjialiang Store, with greater enthusiasm and fervent service, made miners feel convenient and warm everywhere. At the same time, they adopted the method of supplying goods down the well and participating in labor, ascertained the urgent needs of production, organized sources of goods in every possible way, powerfully supported the Tongjialiang Coal Mine in reaching the level of a "ten-thousand-ton mine" for six consecutive months, and completed the purchase and sales plans for January to August with excesses of 7.37% and 12.15% respectively, comprehensively overfulfilling the state's various task indicators.
    Improving Service Has Great Potential
      The achievements of the Tongjialiang Store were not achieved smoothly. At the beginning of this year, some salespersons believed that "last year was a year of the Great Leap Forward, what should be done has been done, and what should be improved has been improved. There is nothing to do this year." Some people lost confidence in the Red Flag movement due to the shortage of some commodities. They believed that salespersons sell goods, and without sufficient commodities, it is impossible to serve customers attentively and thoughtfully. In response to this "seeing things but not people" thinking, the Party branch organized all employees to debate. During the debate, everyone generally realized that this was a right-leaning, fearful emotion, and that the Red Flag competition could not simply emphasize the quantity of commodities, but mainly on the quality of service. In the current situation where some commodities are in short supply, it is even more necessary to strengthen publicity, try to introduce substitutes, strive for reasonable supply, use commodities where production needs them most, and serve production and the masses more attentively and thoughtfully. Later, the Party branch secretary and the manager personally went to the Bai Yuming group and sold goods with everyone. As soon as customers entered the door, they took the initiative to greet them. For out-of-stock commodities, they tried to introduce substitutes, and patiently explained if they could not be replaced. In just three days, this group received 45 written compliments from customers, including 12 from Bai Yuming himself.
    After the right-leaning ideology was more thoroughly eliminated among the employees, in order to guide everyone's soaring enthusiasm for service into specific activities to support the "ten-thousand-ton mine," the branch proposed "three accesses, ten goods, and seven satisfactions" as the content of the Red Flag competition, and put forward the slogan "What needs do the workers have, we will provide what kind of service," setting off a competition upsurge centered on supporting production and improving service quality; at the same time, "Glory Stages," "Red Flag Stages," and "Big-Character Poster Societies" were established in various retail departments, and the battle drums were sounded.
    In this way, everyone felt that the Red Flag competition was not a leap to the top and there was nothing to do, but there were many ways and great potential. After visiting factories and mines and residential areas to investigate and study the needs of production and the masses, everyone unanimously put forward the action slogan of "Sell what is needed, repair what is needed, know what to do, and do what is needed," and adopted the "four determinations" method of determining retail departments, determining groups, determining people, and determining tasks, according to the supply area of each retail department, the business scope of each business group, and the specialties of each employee, increased planned supply, appointment sales, consignment sales, consignment sales of stamps, consignment sales of books and periodicals, collection of sewing and washing clothes, and 73 service items such as repairing radios, clocks, pens, water boots, and furniture.
    After boosting enthusiasm, launching competitions, and increasing service items, now when goods come to the store, especially commonly needed goods, people can just sit at home, and salespersons will deliver the small cards or goods for appointment sales to their homes, so that every household can buy them. Single employees, couples working, and the elderly, weak, disabled, patients, and women in confinement will receive special care. Every two or three days, salespersons will visit them and deliver what they need in a timely manner. Worker Liu Jun lives alone in the mine, and seeing that the weather is getting cold, his cotton clothes have not been dismantled and washed. When salesperson Hai Shengkui learned of this situation, he immediately took his cotton clothes and handed them over to the resident sewing and washing team organized by the store to dismantle and wash them clean. Liu Jun said happily: "This time I can rest assured and guarantee to fight a beautiful battle in production!" Comrade Sun Zuoting, who was injured at work, lay in bed unable to move. Salespersons Ma Xianlong and others visited his dormitory and brought him the matches, cigarettes, and other things he needed. He said gratefully: "Money can't buy such care. I can only repay you with the practical action of producing more coal after my injury is healed." In the thousands of written commendations received by the store, many people expressed that they would use hard work in production to respond to the store's care. Workers Niu Yongchang and Liu Run wrote enthusiastically: "People say that the store is the home of customers, I think it is warmer than my own home; people say that salespersons are relatives, I think they are closer than my own relatives; seeing your service attitude, it has increased our determination to complete the production task!"
    Supply Wherever Production Goes
    In order to support the leap forward in coal mine production in a timely and effective manner, the store established a "Support Production Command" headed by the Party branch secretary. Whenever the mine organizes production campaigns, under the unified dispatch of the command, the retail departments form mobile carts and peddlers, bringing miners' favorite pastries, buns, soda, and other commodities, and go to the pit entrance, open ground, workshop, and construction site to provide mobile supply. The Party branch of the store put forward the slogan "Supply wherever production goes" to the employees, and obtained the consent and support of the coal mine Party committee. Strong salespersons took turns delivering dry food directly down the well for supply. The Sun Fu team of the 841st mining face used to produce about 110 carts of coal per shift. One day, the first half of the shift had already produced 90 carts, but because everyone was hungry and their strength was a little weak, later the store's salesperson delivered dry food. Everyone ate their fill, and then produced 80 carts, exceeding the daily production by 60 carts. The workers praised the salesperson, saying: "Dry food is delicious and delivered happily, supporting us to produce more coal. If we are on the honor roll, the store's contribution must also be counted." Salespersons Ma Xianlong, Li Zhanlong, ? Fengqing, and Qiao Fengde delivered dry food to the 823rd mining preparation team for three consecutive days. After selling the dry food, they loaded coal with the workers. As a result, in addition to completing the original preparation team's task every day, they also produced 57 more carts of coal. After leaving the well, the miners put on glory flowers and also invited them to the "General Seats" prepared for the miners who overfulfilled the task.
    Underground supply not only powerfully supported production, but the salespersons also drew strength from the miners, established a deep relationship with the miners, and established a hardworking and tenacious work style. Salesperson ? Fengqing said with emotion: "In the past, I only saw that miners had inexhaustible money, but now I know that they have endless sweat! When the coal chute rolls past, it won't work if you don't load a shovel of coal. We who stand at the counter are too comfortable, and it's even more wrong to have a bad attitude towards them." One day, a strong wind blew, and then goose feather snow fell. Pedestrians on the road could barely breathe. At this time, the time for the workers to change shifts was approaching. Salespersons Hu Kuan, Wang Xicheng, Lin Xiumei, and others, fearing that the miners would go hungry, bravely carried the goods to the wellhead with rope and levers, so that the workers could still buy what they needed as usual. The workers said with emotion: "We originally thought you couldn't come today, who knew you came after all. You are really giving charcoal in the snow, making us feel warm in our hearts when we eat it."
    Through supplying goods down the well and participating in production, the salespersons personally experienced which commodities were urgently needed for coal mine production, and naturally linked the work of organizing the source of goods with supporting coal production, fundamentally reversing the passive attitude of "selling whatever is available." The salespersons now understand that without air ducts, people can't stand being choked after blasting, so when they heard that new roadways in the coal mine could not buy air ducts, they ran around to find canvas as raw materials, and then found a sewing factory to process them, supplying more than 500 meters of air ducts. The salespersons also experienced that the miners' feet couldn't stand being soaked without water boots, so the store's bicycle repair team added the business of repairing water boots. The salespersons felt that they could not go down the well without willow hats, so the store dispatched special personnel to spend more than two months to organize 13,500 willow hats from more than a dozen counties and cities such as Hunyuan, Yingxian, Langfang, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding, meeting the urgent needs of production.
    In this way, the store employees further understood the coal mine workers, understood their labor conditions and needs, and not only could better serve production, but also better understood the great significance of their work, boosted greater enthusiasm in various tasks, and closely integrated their purchasing and sales activities with the leap forward in coal mine production, truly playing the role of "production logistics department." It is also because of this that one of the silk banners presented to the store by various factory and mine units was written with the six characters: "Stores can also produce coal!"
    Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Non-Staple Foods in the Mining Area
    Since the central government put forward the policy that the supply of non-staple foods in cities should be "mainly self-reliance, supplemented by foreign aid," the Party branch of the Tongjialiang Store, after research, organized everyone to discuss it, specifically analyzed the situation in the mining area, and realized that there are many idle labor forces among the families of factory and mine employees and residents, and employees also have spare time, and the open space in front of and behind the houses can also be used to grow vegetables and raise animals. Striving for partial self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat in the mining area and even gradually achieving basic self-sufficiency is not only necessary, but also possible.
    Therefore, the employees of the Tongjialiang Store first went deep into the residents to understand and found that most residents were willing to grow vegetables and raise chickens, and they asked the store to supply vegetable seeds and chicks; however, some residents were afraid of trouble, afraid of chicken deaths and vegetable rot causing losses, and believed that raising chickens could not grow vegetables (afraid of chickens pecking vegetables) and was not hygienic. According to this situation, the Tongjialiang Store quickly organized to return 128 kilograms of vegetable seeds and 6,700 chicks, and compiled the benefits and methods of developing vegetable growing and breeding into poetry and fast clapper as publicity materials. After contacting the street and the coal mine Party committee, the Party branch secretary of the store and the mine manager made mobilization reports at the family cadres and employee meetings, and then assigned the salespersons of each retail department to contract and publicize in different areas. The salespersons of each retail department carried publicity slogans, chicks, and vegetable seeds, and beat gongs and drums, talking and singing, to the residential areas to publicize, sell, and teach planting and breeding methods, and quickly formed a climax of planting and breeding among the residents. In this Tongjialiang mining area, which used to only see dust flying and only hear machines roaring, a new scene of connecting vegetable plots and flocks of chickens and ducks has now appeared. According to incomplete statistics, more than half of the families in the entire mining area have grown vegetables, covering an area of 156 acres, and a total of 7,400 chickens, more than 300 ducks, more than 700 rabbits, and 52 pigs are raised, which has played a supplementary role in the supply of vegetables and meat.
    Everyone is Red, Diligent, and Clever, Reaching a New Level
    The employees of the Tongjialiang Store not only support the coal mine workers materially, but also encourage each other spiritually. Whenever the coal mine organizes high-yield movements, the store employees use the lunch and evening rest time to organize artistic forms such as yangko dance, small cart clubs, and boat lights, beating gongs and drums to perform at the wellhead, and perform Shanxi opera, Errentai, songs, and fast clapper and other entertainment programs to celebrate the miners' achievements. For the teams that have created new records, they also beat gongs and drums to send congratulatory letters to them. Therefore, when workers and friends create new records, they also report good news to the store, encouraging and promoting each other.
    In the two high-yield movements in Red May, the store employees also wrote 120 letters of condolences and sent them to the well to comfort the miners, and printed publicity slogans on more than 3,000 wrapping paper. The workers and friends recited slogans while eating dry food. Worker Liu Shuanzhu recited: "Drilling is fast, blasting is fast, the store's dry food is delivered fast, the mine carts underground are loaded fast, and the whole mine achieves ten thousand tons fast." After reciting, he jumped up happily and said: "Everyone is fast, how can we not be fast? Let's go! Load coal quickly!"
    Thanks to the correct leadership of the higher-level Party and government, and thanks to the guidance and strong support of the coal mine Party committee, the Tongjialiang Store has further improved and improved in various tasks this year, powerfully cooperating with the leap forward in coal mine production. Recently, this store has been rated as a model unit in the province, city, and district in succession, and all employees have been greatly encouraged. They are determined to learn from the advanced experience of fraternal regions and stores, so as to greatly promote all tasks forward. The slogan that expresses their determination is:
    Everyone is red, diligent, and clever,
    Learn from the advanced everywhere,
    Support the coal mine to exceed ten thousand tons,
    Strive to be a model nationwide. (Attached image)

    万吨矿上的红旗商店
    ——介绍山西省大同市同家梁商店
    山西省大同市口泉区同家梁商店，包括一个商场、三个综合门市部、两个蔬菜门市部、两个小食堂和一个缝纫部，共有职工一百三十二人，担负着同家梁矿区职工和居民一万九千多人的供应任务。在大跃进的1958年，同家梁商店职工在上级党政的领导下，多方面改进了
  供应工作，有力地支援了煤矿生产大跃进，受到了厂矿单位和居民群众的热忱欢迎，找出了工矿区商业工作的正确方向。在继续跃进的1959年，同家梁商店职工鼓起更大干劲、热情服务，使矿工处处感到方便和温暖，同时采取下井供应和参加劳动的办法，摸清生产的急需，千方百计地组织了货源，有力地支援了同家梁煤矿连续六个月达到“万吨矿”的水平，并分别超额7.37％和12.15％完成了1至8月份的购进和销售计划，全面超额完成了国家的各项任务指标。
    改善服务　大有可为
      同家梁商店取得这样的成绩，并不是一帆风顺的。今年年初，有些售货员认为，“去年大跃进了一年，该作的作了，该改进的改进了，今年没啥搞头了”，有些人由于部分商品不足而对红旗运动失掉了信心，他们认为售货员是卖货的，没有充裕的商品就不可能作到殷勤周到地为顾客服务。党支部针对这种“见物不见人”的思想，组织全体职工进行辩论。在辩论中，大家普遍认识到这是一种右倾畏难情绪，而红旗竞赛不能单纯地强调商品的多少，主要看服务质量的高低，在目前部分商品不足的情况下，更需要加强宣传工作，尽量介绍代用品，力求供应合理，把商品用在生产最需要的地方，更殷勤、更周到地为生产、为群众服务。以后党支书和经理亲自到白玉明小组和大家一块卖货，顾客一进门，他们便主动上前打招呼，对脱销的商品尽量介绍代用品，实在无法代替的也耐心解释。仅三天中这个组便得到顾客书面表扬四十五件，其中白玉明本人也得到了十二件。
    在职工中比较彻底地消灭了右倾思想以后，支部为了把大家高涨起来的服务热情，及时引导到支援“万吨矿”的具体活动中去，提出了“三通、十好、七满意”作为红旗竞赛的内容，并提出了“工人有什么样的需要，我们就有什么样的服务”的号召，掀起一个以支援生产、提高服务质量为中心的竞赛热潮；同时，在各门市部建立了“光荣台”、“红旗台”、“大字报社”，敲响了战斗的锣鼓。
    这样一来，大家感到红旗竞赛不是跃进到顶、没有搞头，而是门路很多，大有可为了。经过到各厂矿和居民点登门访问，调查研究了生产和群众的需要，大家一致提出了“卖什么、修什么，会什么、干什么”的行动口号，采取定门市、定小组、定人、定任务的“四定”办法，按照各个门市部的供应区域、各营业组的经营范围和每个职工的特长，增加了计划供应，预约售货，代买代卖，代售邮票，代卖书刊，代收缝洗衣服，以及修理收音机、钟表、钢笔、水靴、家具等七十三种服务项目。
    鼓起了干劲，开展了竞赛，增加了服务项目以后，现在商店来了商品，特别是普遍需要的商品，人们只在家里坐着，便会有售货员把预约售货的小牌或货物送到家里，使家家户户都能买上。单身职工、夫妇上班的以及老弱伤残、病人和产妇，更会受到特殊的照顾，每隔两、三天就有售货员登门拜访，把他们需要的东西及时送到。工人刘俊单身住在矿上，眼看天气凉了棉衣还没有拆洗，心里正在着急，售货员海盛魁得知这个情况后，马上把他的棉衣取来，交给商店组织的居民缝洗小组拆洗干净。刘俊高兴地说：“这回我可安心了，保证在生产上打个漂亮仗！”因工负伤的孙左庭同志，躺在床上不能行动，售货员马献龙等三人到他宿舍访问，并把他需要的火柴、纸烟等东西送去，他感激地说：“花钱也买不到这样的关心，我只有在伤好后用多出煤的实际行动来报答你们。”商店收到的几千件书面表扬意见中，很多人都表示要用努力生产来回答商店的关心。工人牛永昌和刘润热情洋溢地写道：“人们说商店是顾客之家，我看比自己的家还温暖；人们说售货员是亲人，我看比自己的亲人还要亲；看到了你们的服务态度，更增加了我们完成生产任务的决心！”
    生产到哪里　供应到哪里
    为了及时有效地支援煤矿生产跃进，商店建立了以党支部书记为首的“支援生产指挥部”。每当矿上组织生产战役的时候，在指挥部的统一调度下，各门市组成流动车和货郎担，带上矿工最喜爱的糕点、包子、汽水等商品，分头到坑口、明场、车间、工地去流动供应。商店党支部向职工提出了“生产到哪里，供应到哪里”的号召，并取得了煤矿党委的同意和支持，由身强力壮的售货员轮番把干粮直接送到井下去供应。841回采孙福小队，过去每个班出煤一百一十车左右。一天，前半个班已出煤九十车，但因为大家饿了，力气有点不足，后来商店售货员送去干粮，大家吃了个饱，以后又出了八十车，比往日超产六十车。工人们称赞售货员说：“干粮好吃送的欢，支援我们多出炭，我们登上光荣榜，商店功劳也得算。”售货员马献龙、李占龙、?风清、乔凤德一连三天把干粮送到823回采准备班，卖完干粮就和工人一道装煤，结果每天除完成原准备班任务以外，还多出了五十七车煤。出井后，矿工们带上了光荣花，也请他们一同登上了为超额完成任务的矿工们准备的“将军席”。
    井下供应不仅有力地支援了生产，售货员们也从矿工那里吸取了力量，与矿工们建立了深厚的感情，树立了刻苦顽强的工作作风。售货员?风清感慨地说：“过去只看见矿工有花不完的钱，现在才知道他们有揩不完的汗！煤溜子滚过去，少装一锹煤也不成，我们站柜台的太舒服了，对人家态度不好就更不对了。”有一天，刮起了狂风，以后又飘起鹅毛大雪，路上行人顶的喘不过气来。这时工人换班的时间快到了，售货员胡宽、王希成、林秀梅等十五人，怕矿工饿肚子，奋不顾身地用杠绳把商品抬到井口，使工人仍能照常买到自己需要的东西。工人们感动地说：“我们原来以为你们今天来不了，谁想到底来了，你们真是雪里送炭，使我们吃在嘴上，暖在心上。”
    通过下井供应，参加生产，售货员们亲身体验到那些是煤矿生产急需的商品，很自然地把货源组织工作和支援煤炭生产联系了起来，从根本上扭转了“有啥卖啥”的消极态度。售货员们现在懂得了没有风筒，放炮以后就呛得人受不住，于是在听到煤矿新建巷道买不到风筒的时候，就东奔西跑去找帆布作原料，再找缝纫厂加工，供应了风筒五百多米。售货员们也体验到矿工没有水靴，脚泡得受不住，于是商店的自行车修理小组就增加了修补水靴业务。售货员们感到没有柳帽不能下井，商店便抽派专人花了两个多月的时间，到浑源、应县、廊房、石家庄、保定等十几个县市，组织来柳帽一万三千五百顶，满足了生产急需。
    这样，商店职工就进一步了解了煤矿工人，了解了他们的劳动情况和需要，不仅能更好地为生产服务，同时也能更好地了解了自己工作的重大意义，在各项工作中鼓起更大干劲，把自己的购销活动与煤矿生产跃进紧密地结合在一起，真正地起到了“生产后勤部”的作用。也正因为这样，在各厂矿单位赠给商店的锦旗中，有一面锦旗上就写着这样的六个大字：“商店也能出煤！”
    争取矿区副食品自给
    自从中央提出了城市副食品供应要以“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针以后，同家梁商店党支部经过研究，又组织大家讨论，具体地分析了矿区的情况，认识到在厂矿职工家属和居民中有不少闲散的劳动力，职工也有业余的时间，房前屋后的空地也完全可以用来种菜和饲养，在矿区争取蔬菜和肉食的部分自给以至逐步作到基本自给，不仅是必须的，而且也是可能的。
    于是，同家梁商店职工就首先深入居民中进行了解，发现大多数居民愿意种菜养鸡，他们要求商店供应菜籽和鸡娃；但也有少数居民怕麻烦，怕鸡死菜烂受损失，以及认为养鸡不能种菜（怕鸡啄菜）和不够卫生等等。根据这种情况，同家梁商店迅速组织回菜籽一百二十八斤和鸡娃六千七百只，并把发展种菜、饲养的好处和方法编成诗歌快板作为宣传材料。经与街道和煤矿党委取得联系，由商店党支部书记和矿长分头在家属干部和职工大会上作了动员报告，紧接着又责成各门市部分片包干进行宣传鼓动。各门市部的售货员们带着宣传标语、鸡娃，菜籽，敲锣打鼓，又说又唱，到各居民点边宣传、边推销、边传授种植和饲养方法，很快地便在居民中形成了种养高潮。在这个过去只见尘土飞扬，只听得机器轰响的同家梁矿区，目前已经出现了菜畦相连、鸡鸭成群的新景象。据不完全的统计：全矿区有半数以上的家属种了菜，面积达一百五十六亩，共养鸡七千四百只，鸭三百多只，兔七百多只，猪五十二口，对蔬菜和肉食供应起了补充的作用。人人红勤巧　更上一层楼
    同家梁商店职工对煤矿工人不仅在物质上支援，而且还从精神上互相鼓舞。每当煤矿组织高产运动的时候，商店职工就利用中午和晚上休息时间，组织秧歌舞、小车会、船灯等文艺形式，敲锣打鼓去井口表演，并演出山西梆子、二人台、歌曲、快板等文娱节目，给矿工们庆功，对创造了新纪录的班组，还要敲锣打鼓给他们送贺信。因此，工友们每创出新纪录也要向商店报喜，互相鼓舞，互相推动。
    在红五月的两次高产运动中，商店职工还写了一百二十封慰问信，送到井下慰问矿工，同时在三千多张包货纸上印了宣传口号。工友们一边吃干粮，一边念口号。工友刘拴柱念道：打眼快、放炮快，商店干粮送的快，井下煤车装的快，全矿实现万吨快”。他念完高兴地跳起来说：“人家都快，咱还能不快，走！快装煤去！”
    由于上级党政的正确领导，由于煤矿党委的指导和大力支持，同家梁商店今年在各项工作中得到了进一步的改善和提高，有力地配合了煤矿生产跃进。最近这个商店在省、市、区连续被评为标兵单位，全体职工都受到很大鼓舞。他们下定决心学习各兄弟地区和商店的先进经验，以便把各项工作再向前大大推进一步。表现他们决心的口号是：
    人人红勤巧，
    处处学先进，
    支援煤矿超万吨，
    力争全国当标兵。（附图片）
