According to the Hebei Daily, the Cangxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated a water conservancy construction plan, determined to work hard for a winter and a spring to completely conquer drought, flooding, and salinity, and achieve guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood.

    Large-Scale Water Conservancy Construction Transforms the Landscape

Cangxian County is located near the Bohai coast, with many rivers, depressions, and saline-alkali lands, and uneven terrain. Out of the county's 1.68 million mu of cultivated land, 1.25 million mu are saline-alkali land and low-lying areas (750,000 mu of alkaline land), and the remaining 430,000 mu of so-called high land are mostly earthen ridges, which cannot guarantee harvests every year, resulting in very low yields. To get rid of water and drought disasters and change the landscape, the only way is to engage in large-scale water conservancy. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people have been fighting against drought, flooding, and salinity. However, due to the small size of the cooperatives and their limited strength, it was impossible to build large-scale water conservancy projects. After the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes in 1958, under the radiant guidance of the General Line and encouraged by the slogan "Fight hard for three years to change the landscape," the people of the county, with the revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains and seas, reversing the universe," vigorously developed water conservancy, achieving unprecedented achievements. In just over a year, from south to north and from west to east, more than 8,000 main, branch, and minor drainage and irrigation canals were dug, totaling tens of thousands of miles in length, with over 48 million cubic meters of earth excavated. On the banks of the Yun and Jian Rivers, 21 key water intake sluices and 8 pumping stations were built. These massive water conservancy projects enable over one million mu of land in the county to be irrigated in times of drought and drained in times of flood. Of the county's 750,000 mu of large alkaline fields, more than 200,000 mu have been transformed into abundant rice granaries. Despite concentrated rainfall this year, the area of flooded land in the county has been reduced to 180,000 mu, resulting in unprecedented bumper harvests in both summer and autumn. Wheat yields, which used to be only 50-60 jin per mu, have reached an average of 110 jin per mu this year. The yields of autumn crops, both per unit and total, will greatly exceed those of any previous year.

    However, this is only the beginning of changing the natural landscape. There are still 550,000 mu of land in the county that have not been freed from salinity, 380,000 mu of high land without sufficient water sources, and 350,000 mu of low-lying areas still threatened by flooding. In addition, some drainage ditches are too shallow, and water levels are too high, causing severe waterlogging of the land next to the canals, hindering crop growth. In some areas, there are more irrigation canals than drainage canals, resulting in poor water flow. Therefore, continuing to develop water conservancy on a large scale and completely conquering drought, flooding, and salinity remains an extremely arduous task for the people of the county.

    Work Hard for Another Winter and Spring

The unprecedented agricultural harvest brought about by water conservancy construction has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses to build water conservancy. The County Committee is determined to lead the masses in working hard for another winter and spring to completely conquer drought, flooding, and salinity and increase grain production by 200 million jin next year, thoroughly changing the county's landscape. The specific plan is: 1. Vigorously repair and improve canals. Deepen and widen the original three large drainage canals and dig four new large drainage canals. Including the dredging of various canals, a total of 24.6 million cubic meters of earthwork will be involved. 2. Build large numbers of sluices, culverts, and bridges. Construct 25 large-scale intake sluices, regulating sluices, diversion sluices, and drainage sluices on large-scale irrigation canals. Strictly manage the water through sluices and culverts. 3. Build large numbers of pumping stations. In addition to appropriately expanding the existing 15 pumping stations, build 52 more pumping stations. Expand the pumping and irrigation machinery from 1,040 horsepower to 8,000 horsepower, and increase the irrigated area from 50,000 mu to 300,000 mu, basically achieving mechanization of irrigation in high-lying areas. 4. Based on the existing terraced field projects, vigorously level the land, raise low-lying areas and fill in depressions, one mu per terrace, to be completed in three years. Both low-lying and high-lying areas should be transformed into garden-like fields, achieving uniform levels, appropriate water use, and no drought or flooding. 5. Make full use of pits, ponds, and canals to develop aquaculture. 6. With the development of water conservancy construction, vigorously develop water conservancy power stations and electric pumping stations. Based on the water flow velocity, in addition to expanding the Chengguan Thermal Power Plant and the Jiedi Hydropower Station, build eight more medium and small-sized power stations on top of the existing two power stations. Expand the power generation capacity from 615 kilowatts to 7,420 kilowatts, so that 150 villages can achieve electrification, and the entire county will achieve electrification in three years, achieving lighting without oil, and replacing labor for milling and irrigation with electricity.

    Unprecedented Favorable Conditions

To realize this plan, the masses have the desire, the leadership has the determination, and the conditions are possible. First, the people's communes can mobilize manpower, materials, and financial resources; second, the water conservancy practices of the past few years have enabled the leadership to accumulate experience in many aspects, such as opening canals, repairing sluices, building pumping stations and power stations, and training a large number of technical personnel; this year's great agricultural harvest has given people great encouragement and prepared a material foundation for large-scale water conservancy construction. At the same time, the development of county and commune industries has manufactured a large number of pumping and irrigation machinery, so that the county now has 659 new and old pumping and irrigation machines, which is the mechanical power for building a large number of pumping stations. However, the most important thing is that the plan for large-scale water conservancy has a broad mass base. With the development of the water conservancy construction movement, the living reality that many grain-deficient villages have become surplus-grain villages and many old alkaline fields have become rice granaries has attracted the masses. Many production teams have made plans for large-scale water conservancy, and many cadres and commune members have jointly written letters requesting the County Committee to carry out water conservancy modernization to the end. In particular, after the County Committee put forward the draft plan for conquering drought, flooding, and salinity in one year, the broad masses of people expressed warm welcome, communes and teams formulated plans, put forward suggestions, and offered advice to revise the plan. County-level organs organized working groups to solicit opinions everywhere, consult with old farmers for surveying, and held a five-level cadre meeting, on the basis of repeated discussions, so that every project, measure, and indicator in the plan was rooted in the masses.

    Leading the Movement with Revolutionary Methods

Large-scale water conservancy is a massive mass revolutionary movement. Based on the experience of large-scale water conservancy since 1958, the following key links must be grasped in the leadership work:

    (1) Vigorously oppose right-leaning tendencies, vigorously boost morale, hold high the red flag of the General Line, and leap forward again and again. Currently, there is still a small number of people among the cadres who have right-leaning conservative ideas. They cannot see the strong demands of the masses, the superior conditions of the people's communes, or believe in the greatness of the power of the masses. Therefore, they lack confidence in the plan for large-scale water conservancy, making unfounded criticisms, emphasizing difficulties, saying that the plan's pace is too large and too fast, and even pouring cold water on the masses. This kind of thinking is a slow, poor, and wasteful way of thinking, it is a stumbling block on the road to building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and must be resolutely opposed. Among the masses, in conjunction with production, continue to widely and deeply carry out the great discussion of "Can we realize and how to realize next year's water management plan," universally carry out a perspective education for the broad masses, mobilize the masses to analyze the situation, summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy in 1958, and unify thinking. The county held a water conservancy leap forward exhibition, and the communes held large-scale water conservancy on-site visits, so that the examples of those who turned over through water conservancy and the examples of the masses eagerly requesting large-scale water conservancy could be used as living teaching materials to criticize right-leaning sentiments and conservative ideas.

    (2) Persist in carrying out mass movements on a large scale. From now until the spring plowing and sowing, three upsurges of water conservancy construction must be organized. The first upsurge is to combine with wheat planting, concentrate 150,000 people, make a concentrated effort to carry out detailed projects on wheat fields, level the land, adjust the ditches, and repair the roads, so that all wheat is planted on paddy fields, reaching the point where the ridges are as straight as lines, the ground is as smooth as a mirror, and the ditches are connected to ensure smooth drainage and irrigation. The second upsurge is that after the autumn harvest and wheat planting are basically completed, the entire county will concentrate 80,000 to 100,000 people to form a water conservancy professional corps, which will be uniformly deployed and cooperate in a unified way to completely complete the large-scale main canal project before the freezing period. The third upsurge is, from the beginning of spring cultivation to before sowing, to launch a mass movement to level the land and repair detailed ditches on a large scale. For repairing sluices and building stations (pumping stations, power stations), organize professional teams to contract the work. Through these three water conservancy upsurges, it is required that the county basically achieve water conservancy modernization and terrace farming.

    (3) In order to ensure the smooth development of this large-scale water conservancy movement, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the entire Party engaging in water conservancy and establish a strong organizational structure. The county established a command headquarters, with the First Secretary of the County Committee as the general commander, and determined seven County Committee members to be specifically responsible for this work. The communes must also organize command headquarters, led by the First Secretary. More than half of the cadres of the management districts and production teams must be drawn out to do water conservancy work, and timely summarize experience and guide the work.

    大搞群众运动　再干一冬一春
    沧县明年实现水利化
    彻底征服旱涝碱害　全部耕地亩亩保丰收
    据河北日报报道　中共沧县县委制定出水利建设规划，决心大干一冬一春，彻底征服旱涝碱害，实现旱涝保丰收。
    大办水利　改变面貌
    沧县靠近渤海海岸，河流多，洼地多，碱地多，地势高洼不平。全县一百六十八万亩耕地中，有一百二十五万亩是盐碱地和低洼地（碱地七十五万亩），其余四十三万亩所谓高地也多是土岭，年年种不保收，产量很低。要想摆脱水旱灾害，改变面貌，只有大办水利一条路。解放以来，广大人民群众在党的领导下，一直向旱、涝、碱害进行斗争。但是，由于社小，力量小，无法兴修大规模的水利工程。1958年大跃进和人民公社成立以后，全县人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，在“苦战三年，改变面貌”口号的鼓舞下，以“移山造海，扭转乾坤”的革命气概，大兴水利，取得了史无前例的成就。一年多的时间，从南到北，从西而东，开挖了排水和用水干、支、斗渠八千多条，全长万里，挖土四千八百多万公方。在运、碱河两岸，建造了二十一座枢纽进水大闸和八座扬水站。通过这些巨大的水利工程，使全县一百多万亩土地旱了能浇，涝了能排。全县七十五万亩大碱场，已有二十多万亩变成丰盛的稻谷仓。在今年雨水集中的情况下，全县涝地面积减少到十八万亩，获得了夏秋两季空前的大丰收。小麦产量过去每亩只不过五、六十斤，今年平均亩产达到了一百一十斤。秋季作物，单产和总产都将大大超过以往的任何一年。
    但是，这仅是改变自然面貌的开始。全县还有五十五万亩土地没有从碱害中解脱出来，有三十八万亩高地没有充分的水源，有三十五万亩洼地还受着水涝的威胁。此外，由于一些排水沟渠挖得过浅，水位过高，渠旁土地浸泡严重，庄稼生长不旺。也有的因用水渠多，排水渠少，水流不畅。因此，继续大办水利，彻底征服旱、涝、碱害，仍然是全县人民一项极其艰巨的任务。
    再干一冬一春
    水利建设带来今年农业的空前丰收，大大鼓舞了干部和群众兴修水利的积极性。县委决心领导群众再干一冬一春，在明年彻底征服旱、涝、碱害，增产粮食两亿斤。彻底改变全县面貌。具体规划是：一、大力修整渠道。加深加宽原有三条大型排水渠，再新挖四条大型排水渠。连同各个渠道的清淤工程，共计二千四百六十万个土方。二、大建闸涵和桥梁。在大型用水渠上，建筑大型进水闸、节制闸、分水闸、退水闸二十五座。通过闸涵把水严格管理起来。三、大建扬水站。除对原有的十五处扬水站进行适当扩建外，再建扬水站五十二处。排灌机械由一千零四十个马力，扩大到八千个马力，灌溉面积由五万亩扩大到三十万亩，使高地基本上实现灌溉机械化。四、在现有畦田工程的基础上，大搞平整土地，起高垫洼，一亩一畦，三年平完。无论洼地和高地，都要实现园田化，达到水平一致，用水适当，不旱不涝。五、充分利用坑池渠道，发展水产养殖事业。六、随着水利建设事业的发展，大办水利发电站和电力扬水站。根据水的流速，在现有二座电站的基础上，除扩建城关火电厂、捷地水电站外，再新建中、小型电站八座。发电能力由六百一十五瓩扩大到七千四百二十瓩，使一百五十个村庄实现电气化，三年后实现全县电气化，达到点灯不用油，磨面、浇水等劳动由电力代替。
    空前有利的条件
    实现这个规划，群众有要求，领导有决心，条件有可能。首先，人民公社可以调集人力、物力、财力；其次，几年来的水利实践，使领导积累了开渠、修闸、建扬水站和发电站等多方面的经验，培养了大批技术人材；今年的农业大丰收，给了人们极大的鼓舞，给大办水利准备了物质基础。同时，由于县、社工业的发展，制造了大批排灌机械，使全县现有新旧排灌机械达到六百五十九台，这就是大批建立扬水站的机械力量。不过，最重要的，还是大办水利的规划具有广泛的群众基础。随着水利建设运动的发展，很多缺粮村变成余粮村，很多老碱场变成稻谷仓的活生生的现实吸引了群众。很多生产队作出了大兴水利的规划，很多干部、社员联名写信，要求县委把水利化办到底。特别是县委提出一年征服旱涝碱害的规划草案后，广大群众表示热烈欢迎，社社、队队订计划，提建议，献计策，修订规划。县级机关组织了工作组，到处征询意见，和老农一起商量勘测，并召开了五级干部会，在反复讨论的基础上，使规划中每一个项目、措施和指标都扎根于群众。
    用革命办法领导运动
    大办水利，这是一场巨大的群众革命运动。根据1958年以来大办水利的经验，在领导工作上必须紧紧抓住以下几个重要环节：
    （一）大反右倾，大鼓干劲，高举总路线的红旗，跃进再跃进。当前在干部中还有一小部分人，有右倾保守思想，他们看不到群众的强烈要求，看不到人民公社的优越条件，不相信群众力量的伟大，因而对大办水利的规划信心不足，指手划脚，强调困难，说规划的步子大了、快了，甚至给群众泼冷水。这种思想，是一种少、慢、差、费的思想，是多、快、好、省地建设社会主义道路上的绊脚石，必须坚决反掉。在群众中，要结合生产继续广泛深入地开展“能不能实现和怎样实现明年治水规划”的大讨论，向广大群众普遍进行一次前景教育，发动群众分析形势，总结1958年水利大跃进的经验，统一思想。县举办水利跃进展览会，公社举行水利现场大参观，让那些办水利大翻身的典型和群众迫切要求大办水利的事例，做为活教材，来批判右倾情绪和保守思想。
    （二）坚持大搞群众运动。从现在开始，到明年春耕播种以前，要组织三次水利建设高潮。第一个高潮是，结合种麦集中十五万人，突击麦田细部工程，平整土地，调好沟渠，修好道路，使所有小麦都种在水田上，都达到埂直如线，地平如镜，沟渠相连，排灌畅通。第二个高潮是，秋收、种麦基本结束以后，全县集中八万到十万人，组成水利专业兵团，统一调配，统一协作，在结冻前彻底完成大型干渠的工程。第三个高潮是，从春化开始到播种以前，来一个大规模的平整土地、修整细部沟渠的群众运动。对于修闸、建站（扬水站、电站）要组织专业队，包打包干。经过这三个水利高潮，要求全县基本上达到水利化和畦田化。
    （三）为了保证这个大规模的水利运动的顺利开展，必须贯彻全党办水利的精神，确定强有力的组织机构。县成立指挥部，县委第一书记为总指挥，并确定七个县委委员专责掌握这个工作。公社也要组织指挥部，第一书记挂帅。管理区、生产队的干部要抽出半数以上力量作水利工作，并及时总结经验，指导工作。
