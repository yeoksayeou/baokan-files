Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 27th: The Vietnam News Agency reported today that Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, made a statement to Vietnam News Agency reporters on the 26th, saying, "The people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on October 23, 1959, strongly condemn the hostile acts of U.S. imperialism against the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and consider the so-called resolution on the 'Tibet issue' to be illegal and worthless." Prime Minister Pham Van Dong solemnly pointed out in his statement, "As is well known, Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory; the suppression of the rebellion and the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet are entirely China's internal affairs, and no country has the right to interfere."

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, "The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that no country or organization is allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The U.S. pressure on the United Nations General Assembly to pass the above-mentioned resolution is a serious violation of the United Nations Charter and a gross interference in China's internal affairs. This act once again proves that U.S. imperialism has still not abandoned its policy of aggression and interference in China's internal affairs and its slander against China, and is still attempting to weaken the increasingly great influence of the People's Republic of China in the world. However, the People's Republic of China continues to grow stronger, China's international influence is growing, and peace-loving people around the world are increasingly sympathetic and supportive of the Chinese people." Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, "Today, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, the international situation is trending towards relaxation, but U.S. imperialism is still trying to make the situation tense. While interfering in China's internal affairs, U.S. imperialism has been and is increasingly intensifying its interference in South Vietnam and Laos, seriously undermining the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong concluded, "The conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are bound to meet with a shameful defeat, and they will certainly not be able to stop the forward march of the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the Lao people in their struggle for the interests of their countries and for peace in Asia and the world."

    美国对中国和亚洲的挑衅必败
    范文同谴责联大通过“西藏问题”的非法决议
    新华社河内27日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同26日对越南通讯社记者发表谈话说，“越南民主共和国人民和政府全力支持中华人民共和国政府1959年10月23日的声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义对中国政府和中国人民的敌对行为，并且认为所谓关于‘西藏问题’的决议是非法的和毫无价值的。”范文同总理在谈话中严正指出，“如所周知，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分；在西藏平息叛乱和进行民主改革，完全是中国的内部事务，任何国家都无权干涉。”
    范文同总理说，“联合国宪章明确规定，不允许任何国家、任何组织干涉别国内政。美国对联合国大会施加压力使其通过上述决议的行为，是对联合国宪章的严重违反，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。这种行为再一次证明美帝国主义仍然没有放弃侵略和干涉中国内政以及诬蔑中国的政策，仍然妄图削弱中华人民共和国在世界上越来越巨大的影响。但是，中华人民共和国继续不断地壮大，中国的国际影响越来越大，世界爱好和平的人民越来越同情和支持中国人民。”范文同总理说，“今天，由于苏联和社会主义阵营各国的努力，国际局势正趋于缓和，但是美帝国主义仍然力图使局势紧张起来。在干涉中国内政的同时，美帝国主义曾经并且正在日益加紧对越南南方和老挝进行干涉，严重破坏了关于印度支那的1954年日内瓦协议，威胁越南民主共和国的安全，威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    范文同总理最后说，“美帝国主义的阴谋一定要遭到可耻的失败，他们一定无法阻挠中国人民、越南人民和老挝人民为本国的利益、为亚洲和世界和平而斗争的前进步伐。”
