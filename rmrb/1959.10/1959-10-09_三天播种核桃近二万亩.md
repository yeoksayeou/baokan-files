    Nearly 20,000 Mu of Walnut Trees Planted in Three Days
    The Changshi People's Commune in Dafang County, Guizhou Province, amidst the busy autumn harvest season, extracted labor to plant nearly 20,000 mu of walnut trees in a concentrated effort over three days.
    According to experiments conducted by the commune-run forest farm in Changshi People's Commune: fresh walnuts contain a lot of moisture, and after planting, they can sprout in about seven days, and can accelerate the growth of walnut trees. Therefore, this year, as soon as the new walnuts were harvested, labor was organized to plant them. Although it was the tense autumn harvest season, the autumn harvest was not affected at all due to the good organization of labor.

    三天播种核桃近二万亩
    贵州省大方县长石人民公社，在秋收的繁忙季节里，抽出劳力在三天时间内，突击播种近二万亩核桃。
    长石人民公社根据社办林场试验：新鲜核桃水分多，播种以后，七天左右就可出芽，并且能加速核桃树的成长。因此，今年新核桃刚下树，就组织劳力播种。虽然正逢秋收紧张季节，由于劳动力组织得好，丝毫没有影响秋收。
