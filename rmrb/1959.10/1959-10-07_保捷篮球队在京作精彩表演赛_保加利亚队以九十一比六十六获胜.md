Xinhua News Agency, October 6th. More than 6,000 spectators in the capital watched an exhibition match between two strong European basketball teams, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, for the first time tonight at the Beijing Gymnasium. As a result, the Bulgarian team, with their accurate shooting, won 91-66.

The Bulgarian team performed both bravely and steadily tonight. They were aggressive in rebounding, had a tight defense, and rarely made passing errors. Their main offensive tactic was to score through the center, with the captain, the 2.01-meter-tall center Mirchev (No. 5), moving around the basket. His left-handed hook shots were very accurate and difficult to defend against. He scored a total of 22 points, including free throws and field goals, becoming the team's highest scorer. Mirchev was also able to create shooting opportunities for other teammates on the outside, such as Savov (No. 11) and Kolev (No. 7), who were accurate from mid-range. As a result, they also scored 19 and 18 points respectively.

The Czechoslovakian team started tonight by demonstrating an excellent fast-break tactic, with one player passing the ball and another cutting in for a layup, which won warm applause from the audience. However, after playing for more than ten minutes, due to inaccurate shooting, they trailed the Bulgarian team by 15 points at the end of the first half, with a score of 34-49.

In the second half, the Czechoslovakian team adjusted their lineup and tried hard to counterattack, adopting a man-to-man defense. Tomashek (No. 14), who is 1.98 meters tall, Tetiva (No. 3), who is 1.95 meters tall, scored continuously with shots near the basket, and Bo. Lukasik (No. 6) scored with mid-range shots, narrowing the gap to just 10 points at one point, with a score of 48-58. However, the Bulgarian team also increased their offensive speed, and in the end, the Czechoslovakian team lost by 25 points.

After the match, Vice Premier He Long and others went onto the court to meet the athletes from both sides and took photos with them.

    保捷篮球队在京作精彩表演赛
    保加利亚队以九十一比六十六获胜
    新华社6日讯　首都六千多名观众今晚在北京体育馆比赛馆第一次观看了两个欧洲篮球劲旅——保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克国家男子篮球队之间的表演赛。结果投篮准确的保加利亚队以九十一比六十六获胜。
    保加利亚队今晚表演既勇猛又稳健，他们争球积极，防守严密，很少传球失误。他们主要采用通过中锋得分的进攻战术，由队长、身高两米零一的中锋米尔契夫（五号）在篮下左右活动，他左手钩手投篮很准，对方很难防守，全场一个人连罚球带投篮共得了二十二分，成为全队得分最多的队员。米尔契夫还能够及时地给外围的其他队员——中距离投篮准确的萨沃夫（十一号）和卡?夫（七号）等人制造投篮机会，结果他们两人也分别得了十九分和十八分。
    捷克斯洛伐克队今晚开头时，表演了一个人传球另一个人切入上篮投球的出色的快速进攻战术，博得了观众的热烈掌声。但打了十多分钟后，由于投篮不准，上半场结束时以三十四比四十九输给保加利亚队十五分。
    下半场捷克斯洛伐克队调整了阵容，努力反攻，并且采取了人盯人防守战术。身高一米九十八的托马舍克（十四号）、身高一米九十五的特蒂瓦（三号）的篮下投篮和博·鲁卡西克（六号）的中距离投篮连连得分，一度追到四十八比五十八只差十分。但后来保加利亚队也加快了进攻速度，最后捷克斯洛伐克队终于输了二十五分。
    比赛结束后，贺龙副总理等走到球场上接见了双方的运动员，并同他们合影。
