People clearly remember that in 1950, the Party and Chairman Mao put forward the grand plan to harness the Huai River. Chairman Mao issued the great call, "We must harness the Huai River well!" which inspired the soaring enthusiasm of millions of people. In nine years, a short period, nine large mountain valley reservoirs, one lake reservoir, fifteen polder storage projects, sixteen sluice gates were built on the Huai River. One hundred and seventy-five large and small rivers were harnessed, and a series of irrigation and drainage projects and hydroelectric power stations were built. It allows the thousand-mile Huai River to nourish more than 200,000 square kilometers of land in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, ensuring a bumper harvest every year. The Huai River, which had been a scourge for thousands of years, has fundamentally changed its appearance. (Attached pictures)

2. The Fotzuling Reservoir, located in the upper reaches of the Pi River in Huoshan County, Anhui Province, is the first large-scale reservoir built in the Huai River project, which can irrigate more than 680,000 mu of farmland.

3. The Baisha Reservoir on the Ying River, a tributary of the Huai River, can irrigate 1.2 million mu of farmland.

4. The networking of rivers has turned the arid Huaibei area into a land of fish and rice. This is a fish fry farm in Fuyang County.

5. After the Huai River was harnessed, the shipping industry also greatly developed. These are ships sailing on the upper reaches of the Huai River near Huaibin County.

6. Historical sites on the Huai River: Left picture - the "Huai Source" stone tablet at the source of the Huai River under Tongbai Mountain in Henan. Right picture - the "Town Flood" iron ox on Hongze Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River. The reactionary ruling classes of the past were incompetent in governing the Huai River and could only use superstition to fool the people.

7. The residence of Chang Duoyu, a member of the Hongqi Commune in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, was destroyed by floods several times before liberation. Now he has built a new house, and the whole family is living a stable life.

    千里淮河景色新
    人们还清楚的记得，1950年党和毛主席提出了根治淮河的宏伟方案。毛主席发出“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召，鼓舞了千百万人民的冲天干劲。九年，这一个短短的时刻，在淮河上却修起了九座大型山谷水库、一个湖泊水库、十五处洼地蓄洪工程、十六座水闸，整治了大小一百七十五条河道，并兴修了一系列灌溉排涝工程和水力发电站。让千里淮河滋润着豫、皖、苏三省二十几万平方公里的土地，保证了年年丰收。千年为害的淮河从根本上改变了面貌。（附图片）
    1　经过治理后的淮河新貌。这是禹王亭。
    2　佛子岭水库，位于安徽省霍山县淠河上游，是治淮工程中最先修建的一座大型水库，可灌溉农田六十八万多亩。
    3　淮河支流颍河上的白沙水库，可灌溉农田一百二十万亩。
    4　河网化把干旱的淮北变成了鱼米之乡。这是阜阳县的鱼苗养殖场。
    5　治淮以后，也大大发展了航运事业。这是航行在淮河上游淮滨县附近的船只。
    6　淮河上的古迹：左图——淮河源头河南桐柏山下的“淮源”石碑。右图——淮河下游洪泽湖上的“镇洪”铁牛。历代反动统治阶级无能治理淮河，只有用迷信来愚弄人民。
    7　安徽怀远县红旗公社社员常多玉的住房，解放前曾几次被洪水冲毁，现在盖起了新房，一家老小过着安定的生活。
