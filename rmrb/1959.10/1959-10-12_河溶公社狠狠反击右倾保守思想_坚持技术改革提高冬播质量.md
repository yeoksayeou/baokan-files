The Herong Commune in Dangyang County tightly twisted ideological movements and winter planting production movements into one rope, firmly grasping the eight key aspects of area, deep plowing, fertilizer, seed treatment, strip planting, ditch and ridge reform, land leveling, and continuous cropping. They fiercely counterattacked right-leaning thought in technical reform, never relaxing on any aspect and never yielding an inch, powerfully guaranteeing the quality of winter sowing. The Dangyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting here at the beginning of the month, promoting their experience throughout the county.

When Herong Commune countered right-leaning thought in winter sowing technical reform, they adopted different methods targeting different right-leaning conservative ideas; therefore, the counterattack was strong and relatively thorough.

One type of right-leaning thought was that deep plowing and strip planting could not increase production. Therefore, the commune summarized sixty-eight examples from 1959 of increased production gained from implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and cases where failure to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" resulted in little or no increased production. The people involved gave firsthand accounts, educating everyone with their personal experiences. Zheng Zhongkun, the leader of the Second Team of the Qunfeng Production Team in the Lianghe Management Area, led two middle peasants, Zheng Shitai and Zheng Shixiang, to broadcast all forty-five mu of rapeseed in their team. They said, "You believe in strip planting, we believe in broadcasting. Let's see which one can increase production." In response to this situation, the Party Branch organized eleven examples from this year's summer harvest where good implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" led to a bumper harvest, and these examples were presented firsthand throughout the area. Zhuang Youcheng, the leader of the Ninth Team of the Qunfeng Production Team, said at a mass meeting of over three hundred people: "We strip-planted all one hundred and fifty mu of wheat in our team, applying eighty dan of base fertilizer per mu and plowing to a depth of eight cun, resulting in a yield of two hundred and eighty jin per mu. The adjacent eighty mu of wheat was plowed to a depth of four cun, with only twenty dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, and it was all broadcast, resulting in a yield of only one hundred and eighty jin. Zheng Zhongkun! Why do you say strip planting cannot increase production?" Zheng had no answer and had to admit that he was right-leaning and conservative. After the meeting, he led the team members to conscientiously implement the technical measures for strip planting. Over one thousand four hundred people in the entire management area listened to the typical speeches, and added sixty-four dan of base fertilizer per mu to eight hundred and twenty mu of land that had not been fertilized with base fertilizer.

Another right-leaning thought was fear that technical reform would waste labor, saying that there was little labor, and that they desired to do more than they were capable of. In response to this right-leaning thought, they adopted the method of carrying out "three checks and three calculations" (check the season, calculate the time; check the farm work, calculate the labor; check the labor used, calculate the increase in production) to critique this idea. The Herong Management Area planned to plant 26,000 mu of winter crops this year, requiring 260,000 workdays. The 4,000 laborers in the area who were dedicated to winter planting could contribute 160,000 workdays during the sowing season. The remaining 100,000 workdays were basically addressed through tapping labor potential, launching labor competitions, carrying out mutual aid and cooperation, and vigorously reforming tools. Does strip planting use more labor? Their calculations showed that strip planting only uses one more workday per mu than broadcasting, but the future management of strip-planted fields generally only requires nine workdays per mu, while broadcast fields require fifteen workdays. Thus, after offsetting these differences, broadcasting requires five more workdays per mu than strip planting. For the entire area of 26,000 mu, this would require an additional 130,000 workdays. Facts prove that strip planting not only does not use more labor, but also saves labor.

The commune also established ten red flags, such as the Qianjin Production Team in the paddy field area vigorously engaging in drought-resistant deep plowing and strip planting, and the Xinong Production Team over fulfilling its winter sowing fertilizer task. The commune and management area seized these red flags, promptly held on-site meetings to introduce their experience, commend their enthusiasm, and combined on-site visits and typical introductions, raised the question of "Why can others do it while you cannot?" to carry out debates. After visiting the Qianjin Production Team's deep plowing and strip planting, each team in the Chenchang Management Area immediately organized manpower to "make up" the depth of nine thousand four hundred mu of land that was not deep enough.

Herong Commune plans to plant 137,000 mu of winter crops this year, an expansion of 54.4% compared to last year. It plans a grain output of 29,168,300 jin, a 2.43-fold increase over this year's actual harvest; and a total oilseed output of 1,914,000 jin, a 2.9-fold increase over this year. To achieve this plan, it is first necessary to grasp the sowing stage well. However, some right-leaning opportunists and people with serious right-leaning thoughts loudly attacked technical reform, seizing on small issues in the past agricultural technical reform movement, saying that the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" did not proceed from reality. Due to this adverse current of right-leaning conservative thought, before September 22, only 720 mu of the 2,120 mu of beans and rapeseed planted by the whole commune were strip-planted, and 1,400 mu were broadcast and spot-planted, of which 1,200 mu were planted with seeds directly in untilled fields. After firmly grasping the eight key aspects, fiercely countering right-leaning thought, and adopting methods such as leading cadres taking the lead in experimental fields, organizing large-scale inspections, appraisals, and competitions, and vigorously inserting red flags to strengthen leadership, the 65,000 mu of dry land that should be cultivated in the whole commune has been basically cultivated. River fields are generally plowed to a depth of more than eight cun, and paddy fields are generally plowed to a depth of six to eight cun. The original plan for winter sowing fertilizer was 6.6 million dan, but 7.35 million dan has been completed. The plan has now been revised to 8.5 million dan. From the current 52,300 mu of rapeseed, beans, barley, and a small amount of wheat that have been sown, all seeds have been treated, the average base fertilizer per mu has reached 114.5 dan, and all fields that should be strip-planted have been strip-planted. The sowing quality is generally up to standard. In addition, after land leveling and ditch and ridge reform, twenty-nine production teams and one hundred and fifty-five small teams in the whole commune have basically achieved continuous cropping.

　　河溶公社狠狠反击右倾保守思想
    坚持技术改革提高冬播质量
    湖北日报消息　当阳县河溶人民公社思想运动和冬播生产运动拧成一股绳，紧紧把住面积、深耕、肥料、种籽处理、条播、沟厢改革、土地平整和作物连片等八道关口，狠狠反击技术改革中的右倾思想，关关不放松，寸步不退让，有力地保证了冬播的质量。中共当阳县委月初在这里开了现场会，把他们的经验向全县范围内推广。
    河溶公社在反击冬播技术改革中的右倾思想的时候，针对不同的右倾保守思想，采取了不同的方法；因此，反得有力，反得比较彻底。
    一种右倾思想，是说深耕、条播不能增产。于是公社便总结了1959年贯彻执行农业八字宪法获得增产和不执行农业八字宪法不能增产或增产不多的六十八个典型，由当事人现身说法，用亲身经历教育大家。两河管理区群丰生产队二小队队长郑中坤领导两个中农郑世太和郑世相，将全小队四十五亩油菜全部搞撒播。他们说：“你们相信条播，我们相信撒播，到底那种能增产，就比比看。”党总支针对这种情况，组织了今年夏收作物由于贯彻农业八字宪法比较好而获得了丰收的十一个典型，在全区内进行了现身说法。群丰生产队第九小队队长庄有成在三百多人的群众会上说：“我们队里有一百五十亩小麦全部是条播，每亩施底肥八十担，深耕八寸，单产二百八十斤。相连的一块小麦八十亩，耕了四寸，每亩底肥二十担，全是撒播，结果单产只一百八十斤。郑中坤！你为什么说条播不能增产？”郑无言可答，只好承认自己右倾保守，散会后他领导社员认真执行了条播的技术措施。全管理区一千四百多人听了典型发言，将八百二十亩未下底肥的田，每亩又补下底肥六十四担。
    怕实行技术改革浪费劳动力，说劳动力少，心有余而力不足，又是一种右倾思想。针对这种右倾思想，采取了开展三查三算（查季节、算时间；查农活、算劳力；查用工、算增产账）的办法来批判。河溶管理区今年计划冬播二点六万亩，需工二十六万个。全区四千个劳力投入冬播，在播种期可出工十六万个。所欠十万个工，通过挖掘劳动潜力、大搞劳动竞赛、开展互助协作和大搞工具改革，基本上有了着落。条播是否多用工呢？他们算账的结果是：条播比撒播每亩只多用一个工，但条播的田将来培育管理每亩一般只要九个工，撒播的田要十五个工，这样两相抵以后，撒播比条播每亩田要多费五个工。全区二点六万亩田，共要多费工十三万个。事实证明，条播不仅不多用工，相反还要节省工。
    全社还树立了前进生产队水田区大搞抗旱深耕条播、新农生产队超额完成冬播肥料任务等十面红旗。公社和管理区抓住这些红旗，及时召开了现场会，介绍他们的经验，表扬他们的干劲，并结合现场参观和典型介绍，提出“同样条件为什么人家做到了而自己做不到”的题目开展辩论。陈场管理区在参观前进生产队深耕条播后，各队对九千四百亩不合深度的田，马上组织人力“补课”。
    河溶公社今年计划冬播面积十三点七万亩，比去年扩大了54.4％，计划粮食产量二千九百一十六万八千三百斤，比今年的实收产量翻二点四三倍；油料总产一百九十一点四万斤，比今年翻二点九倍。要实现这个规划，必须首先抓好播种关。但是，一些右倾机会主义分子和有严重右倾思想的人，却大喊大叫地攻击技术改革，抓住过去农业技术改革运动中的小浪花，说什么农业八字宪法是不从实际出发。由于这股右倾保守思想的逆流，9月22日前全社播种的二千一百二十亩豆类和油菜田条播的只占七百二十亩，一千四百亩是撒播和点播，其中还有一千二百亩是白田下种。经过紧紧抓住八道关口，狠狠反右倾思想，并采取干部带头搞试验田和组织大检查、大评比、大搞竞赛、大插红旗等方法加强领导以后，全社当前应耕的六点五万亩坂田已基本耕完，河田一般深耕八寸多，水田一般深耕六寸到八寸。冬播积肥原计划六百六十万担，已完成七百三十五万担，目前已将计划修改为八百五十万担。从目前已播种的五万二千三百亩油菜、豆类、大麦和少数小麦来看，种子全部经过处理，底肥每亩平均达到一百一十四点五担，应条播的田都实行了条播，播种质量一般都合乎标准。另外全社经过土地平整和沟厢改制，有二十九个生产队、一百五十五个小队基本上实行了作物连片。
