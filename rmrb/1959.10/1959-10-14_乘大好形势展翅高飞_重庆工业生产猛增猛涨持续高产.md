Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 13th: Chongqing's economic front has seen a rapid and vibrant upsurge since August and September.

　　A prominent characteristic of the city's economic front is: production is surging and rising sharply, maintaining high output, with each wave higher than the last. Comparing September to July, the city's total industrial output value increased by 46.41%. Steel, iron, machine tools, light industrial products, and chemical industrial products generally increased by more than 40%, and coal also increased by nearly 30%. In August and September, the city's production increased with each ten-day period. Taking steel and coal as examples: steel production in mid-September increased by 14% compared to the first ten days of the month, and late September increased by 20.76% compared to mid-September. The daily output of coal jumped from more than 9,000 tons in early September to more than 16,000 tons at the end of September. Since October, many enterprises have achieved high production levels again. Comparing the average daily output in the first ten days of October with the average daily output in September, the city's main products such as steel, iron, and coke increased by a minimum of 8.36% and a maximum of 34.1%.

　　Comprehensive leaps forward in all industries and blooming everywhere are another characteristic of Chongqing's economic front since August and September. In addition to the industrial production front, the city's capital construction, transportation, finance and trade, and other fronts have also made great leaps forward since August and September. One hundred and twenty-three capital construction projects were put into production in the city in September, making it the most of any month this year; these include a converter plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons of steel, two large electric furnaces, a 240-cubic-meter blast furnace, the Zhongliangshan North Mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal, and a 12,000-kilowatt generator unit.

　　The excellent leap forward situation on all economic fronts in the city is mainly due to the city's workers resolutely responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launching a vigorous new upsurge of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy. Countless facts prove that once right-leaning conservative thinking is opposed, production quickly rises. For example, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's production used to fluctuate, but after opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy, the workers were highly motivated. The average daily steel production in September increased by 40% compared to July, and by 20% compared to the highest month of this year. After the workers of Chongqing Machine Tool Factory opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted morale, their enthusiasm for production was extremely high. In September, they produced one hundred and fifteen large machine tools, more than five times that of July, and the product quality all met the requirements.

　　The tremendous achievements made by all industries in the city in August and September are also due to adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, launching a socialist emulation campaign of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, and vigorously engaging in technical innovation and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. More than 80% of the city's workers participated in the emulation campaign. In the competition, they further developed the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, realized a large number of technical innovation proposals, created many new records of high production, and promoted the continued great leap forward in production. The city's workers put forward more than 360,000 technical innovation proposals in August and September, and created more than 30,000 new records of high production in September alone. The Air Compressor Factory continuously organized technical innovation and promoted advanced experience, and realized more than 16,000 technical innovations in September, ensuring that the factory completed the third quarter plan eight days ahead of schedule.

　　Many enterprises strengthened enterprise management on the basis of vigorously carrying out mass movements, focusing on technical management, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair, improving product quality, and ensuring safe production, which created good conditions for sustained high production. All units strengthened specific leadership over production, let go and mobilized the masses, and implemented plans to each shift, group, furnace, machine, and even each worker, so that the plan became the workers' own struggle goal. During this period, most factories and mines grasped group work, and a series of activities such as making plans, proposing measures, and tackling key problems were carried out through groups, so the plans were more implemented, the measures were more specific, and the key production problems were quickly solved. Taking Jiangling Machine Factory as an example, they first summarized the experience of advanced groups, set up typical examples, and promoted them throughout the factory; then, they organized various groups to compete in a contest, striving to catch up with the advanced groups; leading cadres went deep into the groups to cultivate experimental plots, grasp typical examples, create experience, and promote the general. In this way, in just over a month, 30% of the groups in the factory reached the production level of advanced groups.

　　乘大好形势展翅高飞
    重庆工业生产猛增猛涨持续高产
    据新华社重庆13日电　重庆市经济战线上，8、9月份以来出现了突飞猛进、万紫千红的大好形势。
    全市经济战线上一个显著的特点是：生产猛增猛涨，持续高产，一浪比一浪高。以9月份同7月份比较，全市的工业总产值增长了46.41％，钢、铁、机床、轻工业品和化学工业品等，一般都猛增了40％以上，煤也增长近30％。8、9月份，全市生产一旬比一旬高。以钢、煤为例：钢9月中旬比上旬增长14％，下旬又比中旬增长20.76％；煤的日产量由9月初的九千多吨连续跃到9月底的一万六千多吨。10月份以来，许多企业又出现了高产水平。以10月上旬的平均日产量同9月份的平均日产量比较，全市的钢、铁、焦炭等主要产品，最低增长了8.36％，最高增长了34.1％。
    各行各业全面跃进，遍地开花，这是重庆市经济战线8、9月份以来出现的又一特点。除了工业生产战线之外，全市基本建设、交通运输、财贸等各个战线，8、9月份以来也同样有很大跃进。9月份全市投入生产的基本建设项目有一百二十三项，成为今年最多的一个月；其中有年产三十万吨钢的一个转炉厂，两个大电炉，一座二百四十立方米的高炉，年产九十万吨煤的中梁山北矿井，一万二千瓩的发电机组等。
    全市各个经济战线上出现的这种大好的跃进局面，主要是由于全市职工坚决响应了党的八届八中全会的号召，轰轰烈烈地掀起了一个反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的新高潮。无数事实证明，一反右倾保守思想，生产就很快上升。如重庆钢铁公司以前生产时起时伏，反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约以后，职工干劲高昂，9月份钢的平均日产水平比7月份猛增40％，比今年最高的月份也增长了20％。重庆机床厂工人反右倾、鼓干劲后，生产热情十分高涨，9月份生产了大型机床一百一十五台，比7月份猛增五倍多，产品质量全部符合要求。
    全市各行各业8、9月份获得巨大成就，还由于坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，开展了学先进、比先进、赶先进的对手竞赛，并且大闹技术革新、大力总结推广了先进经验。全市有80％以上的职工投入了竞赛热潮。在竞赛中，他们进一步发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，实现了大量技术革新建议，创造了许多高产新纪录，推动了生产的继续大跃进。全市职工8、9月份提出的技术革新建议有三十六万多件，在9月一个月内就创造了三万多次高产新纪录。空气压缩机厂不断组织技术革新和推广先进经验满堂红竞赛，在9月份就实现了技术革新一万六千多项，保证全厂提前八天完成了第三季度计划。
    许多企业在大搞群众运动的基础上加强了企业管理工作，突出地抓了技术管理，加强了设备维护检修，提高产品质量，保证安全生产，就给持续高产创造了良好的条件。各单位加强对生产的具体领导，放手发动群众，把计划落实到每个班、组，每个炉子、机台，以至每个工人，使计划成为工人群众自己的奋斗目标。这一时期，大部分厂矿企业都抓了小组工作，订计划、提措施、攻关键等一系列活动都通过小组进行，因而计划更加落实，措施更加具体，生产关键很快得到解决。以江陵机器厂为例，他们首先总结了先进小组的经验，树立典型，在全厂推广；然后，组织各小组打擂比武，力争赶上先进小组；领导干部深入小组种试验田，抓典型，创造经验，推动一般。这样，仅一个多月的时间，全厂就有30％的小组达到先进小组的生产水平。
