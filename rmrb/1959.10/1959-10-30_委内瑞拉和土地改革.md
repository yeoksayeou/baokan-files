    Venezuela and Land Reform
    Venezuela　Salvador de la Plaza
    In the early part of the last century, after a long and arduous war, the people of seventeen Latin American countries threw off the rule of the Spanish monarchy and established republics, Venezuela being one of them. Later, Brazil broke away from the Portuguese monarchy and achieved independence; Panama seceded from Colombia; and finally, Cuba also fought for its independence at the beginning of this century. At the same time, the United States, which had completely embarked on the path of imperialism, seized Puerto Rico and the Philippines from Spain. Thus, the Spanish monarchical empire came to an end in the Americas and Asia, replaced by the rule of American imperialism, which threatened the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries in Asia and the Americas.
    When the first Spaniards landed in the Americas in 1492, the indigenous residents were at different stages of development. The Indians of Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru had achieved brilliant cultural and socio-economic development, while the Indians of Venezuela were in the stage of primitive communes, mainly engaged in fishing, hunting, and primitive agriculture. Because of this, the Spaniards did not expend much effort in conquering Venezuela, and they exterminated the Indians who resisted during the war or rebelled against the harsh and heavy labor. This vast territory was occupied by "colonizers" through "division" or the king's "grant." After the indigenous residents were wiped out, these "colonizers" imported slaves from Africa to engage in agricultural labor and mining, dragging the society back to a stage of development far behind Europe. They established large-scale plantations of cocoa, sugar cane, indigo, cotton, etc., and raised cattle and horses. They used imported black slave labor or the labor of "reliable" natives to engage in these labors, thus appearing the large estates, which were respectively called "farms" and "ranches." On the other hand, the domestic population increased not only from the children born of Indian women (some of whom were raped by Spaniards, and some of whom were taken as concubines), but also from the children of black slaves and white people, as well as Spanish artisans, small farmers, unemployed vagrants, and soldiers who came to the Americas; they were also the necessary human resources for engaging in various rural construction works. By the end of the eighteenth century, Venezuela had formed a society of about 850,000 people, with various classes, composed of slaves and free people. Among the free people, there were large landowners with or without the title of "descendants of conquerors," Spanish government officials specially dispatched by the suzerain state, artisans, natives, and the lowest-level freed black slaves. Spain maintained its rule through a set of institutions such as governors, generals, judges, and the Catholic clergy. Therefore, economic, social, and political development was very slow.
    In 1811, representatives from the provinces of Venezuela signed the Declaration of Independence. All these representatives spoke in the name of the people, claiming to be spokespersons for the people's regime, but they were all large landowners and slave owners. They neither gave up any land nor gave any slaves freedom. The first republic existed for less than two years, and the Spanish monarchy restored its rule over Venezuela, thus beginning a long and brutal war of independence. After the victory, Gran Colombia was established, jointly composed of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1830, Venezuela established an independent state.
    On the economic basis of large estates cultivated by slaves, a democratic republic with separation of powers was established, with the president and legislative members elected by universal suffrage. This system has not yet stabilized. The history of the one hundred and twenty-nine years since the establishment of the new republic is only the continuation of the power struggles among the large landowners, the history of the people's participation in the civil war under the slogans of democracy and land redistribution, the history of dark and bloody tyranny, and the history of the trade union movement and the struggle to get rid of imperialist enslavement. Despite Venezuela's extremely rich resources of oil, iron, and natural gas, its people, workers, and peasants are in extreme poverty, while a small number of people monopolize huge amounts of wealth and indulge in extravagance.
    Why is it that Venezuela, one hundred and twenty-nine years after its liberation from Spanish monarchical rule, still faces the task of striving for economic and political independence and establishing a bourgeois democracy? The land system inherited from the colonial period has hindered the development of Venezuela's economy and democratic system. Slavery was legally abolished in 1854, but slaves had already begun to fight for their own liberation since the war of independence. They fled to remote frontiers to avoid police persecution or armed resistance against the police. For these reasons, in the initial years after the establishment of the republic, large farm and ranch owners lacked labor. In order to guarantee the income from land rent, they used "sharecroppers" instead of slaves on large plantations, and tenant farmers in smaller crops. Cocoa, sugar cane, indigo, and coffee plantations were rebuilt in the form of new production relations, which still exist today. Its characteristic lies in allowing farmers, that is, "sharecroppers," to develop a piece of mountain land, plant cocoa, coffee, etc., and undertake the obligation: when the fruit trees are producing, they must sell all the fruits to the landowner at half price, and they must also do all kinds of necessary labor in the farm like hired farmers. Before the beginning of this century, the method of paying wages by landlords was to issue a kind of paper ticket that could only be exchanged in the "store" of the farm. Before the fruit trees matured, if the farmer's wages were not enough to cover expenses (and this was the general rule), they could be in debt in the "store", using the future income of the fruit trees as collateral. In this way, the farmers were tied to the hands of the farm owners, forming a relationship of dependence similar to that of serfs and lords. They could not leave the farm if the debt in the "store" was not cleared. This debt was also inherited by their descendants, passed down from generation to generation.
    The grain produced by tenant farmers is subject to a monetary rent of one-fourth, one-third, or one-half to the landlord, depending on the type of crop and whether the landlord provides seeds and draft animals. The vast number of landless farmers who do not work on the farm gradually go deep into the mountains and remote areas, and maintain their lives by engaging in primitive operations in "orchards." In the countryside, petty merchants and wealthy businessmen often lend farmers small amounts of money or provide food, to be repaid after the autumn harvest, but after the harvest, they are bought at extremely low prices, while the goods they provide are charged at very high prices. The same servile form exists in the labor in "ranches." Wages are also paid in paper tickets, and there is a "store" in each "ranch." The national economy is built on the basis of this form of production, using the export of cocoa, coffee, meat, etc. to exchange for foreign exchange to pay for the import of manufactured goods or other products that are not produced domestically.
    The concentration of land in Venezuela is serious. According to the first national agricultural and pastoral population survey in 1937, private ownership accounted for more than 21.2 million hectares of the country's 90 million hectares of land, of which about 20 million hectares were engaged in animal husbandry, and only more than 3 million hectares were engaged in agriculture. Among these agricultural lands, the cultivated area was only 700,000 hectares. Agricultural land was occupied by 59,000 landlords, of which 4.4% of the landlords monopolized 78.7% of the land. That is to say, 95.6% of the farmers only occupied 21.3% of the land.
    Such a high degree of land concentration seriously shackles the productive forces and causes the decline of agriculture and animal husbandry. Coupled with the existence of a parasitic population in the countryside that does not engage in production, and the need to purchase all the necessary manufactured goods from abroad, it is impossible to realize the capital accumulation necessary for developing industry. Another fact that makes this situation worse is that the agents of the emerging Western imperialism, the new "conquerors," have entered the country, and in a very short period of time have become the country's main importers and exporters. This control is also achieved through the "store" system. But larger-scale "stores" are those that lend in advance to large farm owners and ranch owners, using the harvest as collateral. After the autumn, they buy new grains at low prices and force farm and ranch owners to buy imported goods at high prices. In this way, the surplus profits produced by the working people of Venezuela are squeezed out and carried to their own countries. Therefore, the accumulation of national capital is further reduced. They are Venezuela's first comprador class, agents of capitalist countries, whose purpose is to turn backward countries into sources of cheap raw materials and markets for dumping surplus industrial and agricultural products from their own countries, so that they will always be in an underdeveloped state. British and German consortia also invested in railway, tramway construction and coal mining, but the amount was negligible. Venezuela is gradually becoming a colony of the United States.
    The path of Venezuela's colonization has raised the urgency of seeking a way out for national liberation, national independence, and economic development. Changing the land system, enabling the dispersed masses of peasants who have fallen into poverty to participate in the production process, promoting industrial development, and liberating the productive forces have become the basic goals of the progressive forces' struggle. Land reform is no longer just an exclusive demand of peasants, but is regarded as a means and tool to solve the problem of national economic construction and to free the country from dependence on imperialism and imperialist infiltration.
    The large estate ownership and all the production relations that coexist with it should be replaced by a new structure based on small and medium-sized ownership, distributing land to landless or land-poor farmers, who will directly cultivate it with their entire families. Once the farmers who have obtained land are gathered in production units, and the state provides long-term low-interest loans, technical assistance, education, health, transportation, distribution of products, etc., they will not only be able to produce everything they need for their lives, but also have surplus products to sell to the market, and therefore be able to purchase industrial products produced by the cities. The exchange between agricultural and pastoral producers and industrialists will liberate the national productive forces and increase the accumulation of national capital, which is the foundation for achieving new economic and political development and ending dependence on imperialism.
    At present, Venezuela imports more than 500 million bolivars (Venezuelan currency) of grain every year (which the country can produce itself), which is a most direct dependence and should be eradicated from the root. Venezuela's natural resources are developed and exported abroad by international trusts; efforts should be made to enable the state to participate more extensively in this development, and the state should personally develop and export these resources. Due to the shrinking of the domestic market and the infiltration of imperialism, industrial development is very slow. Efforts should be made to develop basic industries, such as the steel industry, the petrochemical industry, oil refining, the utilization of natural gas, etc., build a railway network, and electrify the whole country. These basic constructions are closely linked to each other, and the initial driving force is land reform.
    Different from the 1945 and 1948 land reform laws that did not take effect, the current draft land reform law, on the one hand, guarantees the right of farmers, especially those in peasant-inhabited areas, to obtain land ownership, and at the same time establishes regulations for farmers to concentrate in residential areas, stipulating the state's obligation to provide loans, distribute products, and organize cooperation for small producers. However, this draft law also has serious shortcomings, that is, it does not dare to touch the interests of the large estate owners. The draft law only stipulates that distribution will be carried out when large estates are not productively efficient, and does not stipulate any restrictions on the scale of farms, nor does it stipulate any restrictions on foreigners. The draft also stipulates that when the government distributes state-owned and expropriated private wasteland to farmers, it will collect a certain amount of money from the farmers. Obviously, this bill cannot fully meet the farmers' land demands. The representatives of the Communist Party of Venezuela who participated in the formulation of the land reform bill have refused to sign the draft. Now, the parliament is debating this bill, and progressive and reactionary forces will continue to fight over the land reform issue.
    Despite the serious shortcomings of the land reform bill mentioned above, the reactionary forces, first of all imperialism, are still very afraid. They have concentrated their firepower to attack this draft and stubbornly oppose it becoming law. However, the various problems derived from the large estate land system, such as the influx of peasants into cities, the reduction of agricultural and pastoral production, the continuous increase in grain imports, and the extremely poor living conditions of the peasants, have become so acute and alarming that land reform has become the demand of an increasing number of people. At the congress held at the end of May, the National Farmers' Organization warned the country: while a small number of rich people are extravagantly enjoying the wealth of oil, the peasants can no longer continue to endure hunger. The congress declared: "Land will either be obtained peacefully through legal means, or it will be obtained through bloody means. We advocate the first method, but we do not refuse to take the other method if the situation forces us to do so." (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Xin Fei)

    委内瑞拉和土地改革
    委内瑞拉　萨尔瓦多·德·拉·普拉萨
    上个世纪初拉丁美洲十七个国家的人民群众经过长期和艰苦的战争，摆脱了西班牙君主制的统治而建立了共和国，委内瑞拉就是其中之一。后来，巴西摆脱了葡萄牙的君主统治而取得了独立；巴拿马从哥伦比亚分裂出来；最后，古巴也在本世纪初争得了自己的独立。与此同时，已经完全走上帝国主义道路的美国，从西班牙手里夺去了波多黎各和菲律宾。至此，西班牙的君主帝国在美洲和亚洲就宣告结束了，取而代之的是在亚洲和美洲威胁各国人民自由和独立的美帝国主义的统治。
    1492年，第一批西班牙人登陆美洲时，当地的土著居民是处于不同的发展阶段的。墨西哥、危地马拉、秘鲁的印第安人已经取得了辉煌的文化发展和社会经济组织的发展，而委内瑞拉的印第安人则处于原始公社阶段，以渔、猎和原始农业为主。正因如此，西班牙人并未付出很大力量就把委内瑞拉征服了，他们把在战争期间进行抵抗或不堪忍受艰苦繁重的劳动起而反抗的印第安人消灭得一干二净。这片辽阔的疆土通过“瓜分”或国王的“钦赐”被“殖民者”占有了。土著居民被消灭之后，这些“殖民者”从非洲输入奴隶从事农业劳动和采矿，把当时的社会拉向一个远远落后于欧洲的发展阶段。他们建立了大规模的可可、甘蔗、靛青园、棉花等种植园，饲养牛马。他们利用输入的黑奴劳动力或“可靠的”土人的劳动力来从事这些劳动，这样就出现了大庄园，它们被分别称为“农场”和“牧场”。另一方面，国内增加的人口不仅有来自印第安妇女（她们有的遭到西班牙人的蹂躏，有的被西班牙人纳妾）所生的子女，也有黑奴的子女和白人生的子女，同时，还有到美洲来的西班牙手工业者、小农、无业流民和士兵；他们也就是从事兴建农村的各项工作必需的人力。到十八世纪末，委内瑞拉已经形成一个约有八十五万人口、存在各种阶层的社会，它由奴隶和自由人所组成。在自由人阶层中从带有或没有“征服者”后裔称号的大土地所有者，宗主国特派的西班牙政府官员，手工业者，土人直到最低层的已获得自由的黑奴。西班牙通过总督、将军、法官和天主教派教士团等一套机构来维持其统治。因此，经济、社会和政治发展是非常迟缓的。
    1811年，委内瑞拉各省代表签订了独立宣言。所有这些代表都以人民的名义发表讲话，宣称自己是人民政权的代言人，但是他们全都是大土地所有者和奴隶占有者。他们既没有放弃任何土地，也没有给任何奴隶以自由。第一个共和国存在不到两年，西班牙君主制恢复了对委内瑞拉的统治，从而开始了长期的残酷的独立战争。胜利之后建立了由委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和厄瓜多尔联合组成的大哥伦比亚。1830年委内瑞拉建立了独立国家。
    在由奴隶耕种的大庄园制的经济基础上，建立了三权分立的民主共和国，总统和立法委员由普选产生。这种制度至今尚未稳定。新的共和国成立以来的一百二十九年的历史，只不过是大庄园主之间争权斗争的继续的历史，也是人民在民主和重分土地的口号下参加进来的内战的历史，是黑暗血腥的暴政的历史，也是工会运动和摆脱帝国主义奴役的斗争的历史。尽管委内瑞拉拥有极为丰富的石油、铁、天然气的富源，它的人民、工人、农民却处于极端的贫困中，而一小撮人则垄断着巨额的财富，穷奢极欲。
    为什么委内瑞拉从西班牙君主制统治下解放一百二十九年后的今天，仍面临着争取经济和政治独立，建立资产阶级民主的斗争的任务呢？从殖民地时期继承下来的土地制度阻碍了委内瑞拉经济和民主制度的发展。1854年奴隶制在法律上被废除了，但是，从独立战争时起，奴隶就已经开始争取本身的解放。他们为了躲避警察的迫害而逃亡到偏僻的边疆，或对警察进行武装抵抗。由于这些原因，共和国建立后的最初几年，大农牧场主是缺乏劳动力的，为了保证地租的收入，他们在大种植园中使用“共耕农”代替奴隶，在较小的农作中则使用佃户。可可、甘蔗、靛青、咖啡种植园在新的生产关系的形式上重建起来，这种形式至今依然存在。其特点就在于允许农民，即“共耕农”，开发一块山地，播种可可、咖啡等，并且承担义务：在果树生产时，必须以半价把果实全部卖给土地所有者，而且还必须像雇农一样在农场中做各种必需的劳动。在本世纪初以前，地主支付工资的办法是发一种只能在该农场的“商店”里兑换的纸票。在果树成熟之前，如果农民的工资不敷支出（而这是一般的规律），可以在“商店”赊欠，以将来果树的收入作抵。这样农民就被束缚在农场主的手里，形成类似农奴与农奴主的依附关系，他们在“商店”的债务一日不清是不能离开农场的。这种债务还要由子孙承继，一代一代地传下去。
    佃户生产的粮食，向地主缴纳四分之一、三分之一到二分之一的货币地租，比例要依照作物的种类和地主是否提供种子、耕畜而定。不在农场工作的其他无地的广大农民逐渐深入山区和偏僻地区，在“果园”里进行原始经营来维持自己的生活。在农村中，小商巨贾常贷给农民少量的钱或提供食粮，待秋后偿还，但收成后则以极低的价格收进，而他们提供的商品则收取很高的价格。在“牧场”中的劳动存在着同样奴役性的形式。工资也以纸票支付，每个“牧场”里都有“商店”。国家的经济就建筑在这种生产形式的基础之上，用可可、咖啡、肉类等的出口，换取外汇，偿付制成品或国内不生产的其他产品的进口。
    委内瑞拉的土地的集中程度是严重的。据1937年第一次全国农牧业人口调查，全国九千万公顷土地中私人占有二千一百二十多万公顷，其中有约二千万公顷经营牧业，只有三百多万公顷经营农业，而在这些农业土地中，耕地面积只有七十万公顷。农业土地由五万九千家地主所占有，其中4.4％家地主垄断了78.7％的土地。也就是说，95.6％的农民只占有21.3％的土地。
    土地如此高度集中，严重地束缚了生产力，造成农牧业的衰落。再加上农村中不事生产的寄生人口的存在，并要从国外购买所必需的一切制成品，这样，想实现发展工业所必要的资本积累是不可能的。还有一件事实更使这种状况恶化了，那就是：新兴的西方帝国主义的代理人，新的“征服者”打进了国内，他们在很短期间就一变而为国内的主要进出口商。这种控制也是通过“商店”制度取得的。但是更大规模的“商店”，也就是以收成作抵预先贷款给大农场主和牧场主。秋后他们以低价买进新谷，而强迫农牧场主以高价购买进口的商品。就这样榨取了委内瑞拉劳动人民生产的超额利润，并且把利润携往他们本国。因此，也就更加减少了民族资本的积累。他们是委内瑞拉最初的买办阶级，资本主义国家的代理人，他们的目的就是把落后国家变成廉价原料的来源和抛出本国工农业剩余产品的市场，使之永远处于不发达的境地。英国和德国财团在铁路、电车修建、煤矿开采方面也有投资，但数量却微不足道。委内瑞拉一步步地成为美国的殖民地。
    委内瑞拉殖民地化的发展道路，向人们提出了为民族解放、国家独立和经济发展问题寻求出路的迫切性。改变土地制度，使沉沦于贫困之中的分散农民群众参加生产过程，促进工业发展，解放生产力，这就成为进步力量斗争的基本目标。土地改革已经不再单是农民专有的要求，人们把它看作同时解决国民经济建设问题和使国家摆脱对帝国主义的依赖和帝国主义渗入的手段和工具。
    大庄园所有制和与它共生的一切生产关系应当被建立在中、小所有制基础上的新的结构所代替，把土地分给无地或少地的农民，由农民全家直接耕种。这样获得土地的农民一旦集合在生产单位中，由国家提供长期的低息贷款，提供技术援助、教育、卫生、运输、分配产品，等等，他们就不仅能够生产他们生活需要的一切产品，而且还会有多余的产品卖给市场，因此也就能够购买城市生产的工业产品。农牧业生产者和工业家之间的交换将解放全国的生产力，增加民族资本的积累，这是取得新的经济和政治发展，结束对帝国主义的依赖的基础。
    目前，委内瑞拉每年要输入五亿多波利瓦（委币）的粮食（这些粮食本国是能生产的），这是一种最直接的依赖，应当从根铲除。委内瑞拉的自然资源是由国际托辣斯开发和输出国外的；应当争取国家更广泛地参加这种开发，国家应当亲自开发和输出这些财富。由于国内市场的缩小和帝国主义的渗入，工业发展很迟缓，应当着手发展基本工业，如钢铁工业、石油化学工业、石油提炼、天然气的利用等，建设铁路网，使全国电气化。这些基本建设都是彼此紧密联系的，其起始的动力就是土地改革。
    同没有生效的1945年和1948年土地改革法不同，现在制定的土地改革法草案，一方面保证农民，首先在农民聚居的地区的农民有获得土地所有权的权利，同时确立农民集中在居民区的规章，规定国家给小生产者贷款，分配产品，组织合作的义务等。但是，这个法律草案还存在着严重的缺点，就是它不敢触动大庄园主的利益。法律草案只规定当大地产没有生产效能时才进行分配，对于农场的规模没有规定任何限制，对外国人也没有规定任何限制。草案还规定政府在把国有和征用的私有荒废土地分配给农民时，要向农民收回一定的价款。很显然，这个法案完全不能满足农民的土地要求。参加制定土地改革法案的委内瑞拉共产党代表已经拒绝在草案上签字。现在，议会正就这个法案进行辩论，进步力量和反动力量还将在土地改革问题上进行斗争。
    尽管土地改革法草案有着上述的严重缺点，反动势力，首先是帝国主义还是非常惧怕，他们已经集中火力来攻击这个草案，死硬地反对它成为法律。然而，大庄园土地制所派生的各种问题，如农民流入城市、农牧业生产减少、粮食进口不断增加、农民生活异常贫困等问题，已经尖锐到如此惊人的地步，以致土地改革已为越来越众多的人们的要求。全国农民组织在5月底召开的代表大会上向全国发出警告：在一小撮富人穷奢极欲地享受着石油财富的时候，农民不能再继续忍受饥饿。大会宣称：“土地要末通过法律和平地取得，要末采用流血的方式取得。我们主张第一种方式，但是我们也不拒绝采取另一种方式，如果情况迫使我们这样做的话。”　（本报特约稿　辛飞译）
