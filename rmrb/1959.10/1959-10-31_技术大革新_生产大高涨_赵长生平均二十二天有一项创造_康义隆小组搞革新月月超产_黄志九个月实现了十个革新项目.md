Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th: Zhao Changsheng, a lathe operator at the Jiangxi Tractor Manufacturing Plant, has implemented 65 major technical innovations in four years and seven months, averaging one innovative creation every 22 days. Some of his innovations have increased efficiency by dozens of times. As a result, he completed the workload of thirteen years, six months, and three days in six years and nine months, and has now started working on July 1966 tasks.

Actively and proactively finding solutions and identifying key issues are the important reasons for Zhao Changsheng's success in technical innovation. In July 1958, the factory rushed to produce 30-horsepower gas engines to support the rural fight against drought. During the production of the cylinder head, a key component of the gas engine, Zhao Changsheng worked day and night with everyone to study and eventually successfully innovated a double-wheel cylinder head drilling tool, increasing efficiency sevenfold. During the intense battle in August and September this year, problems occurred with the tractor part, the swivel joint, which failed to meet the work quota and quality standards, seriously affecting production. Zhao Changsheng worked tirelessly to repeatedly study how to break through this difficulty. Finally, with the assistance of technician Huang Zhenhua, he improved a tool, increasing efficiency nineteenfold, making the quality of this part excellent and firing the first shot in the battle of August and September.

Zhao Changsheng only has a junior elementary education and entered the factory as an apprentice in 1951. He often uses his spare time to study political theory and technical books such as "Lathe Operator's Manual," "Mechanical Worker," and "Mechanical Drawing," and asks master craftsmen and technicians for help when he doesn't understand. This has greatly improved his political and ideological awareness and cultural and technical level, and he has quickly applied it to his work.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th: The Kang Yilong Oxidation Group of the state-owned Huashan Machinery Factory, since its establishment in December 1957, has implemented more than 70 technical innovations, greatly increasing production efficiency, saving a large amount of wealth for the country, and overfulfilling production tasks every month.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Kang Yilong Group actively responded to the Party's call and carried out technical innovations targeting key production issues. At that time, the most difficult problem for the group's workers in production was that the hot oxidation method of treating parts required operation at a temperature of about 150 degrees Celsius, which easily caused burns and scalds. The evaporated odor of the rust inhibitor often made people dizzy, affecting workers' health. More seriously, it was often impossible to buy the resistance wire needed for hot oxidation, affecting the completion of production tasks. Therefore, they studied changing the hot oxidation method to a cold oxidation method. After more than 200 failures, the experiment was successful. This creation increased production efficiency threefold, saving the factory 160,000 yuan annually, greatly improving working conditions, and ensuring safe production.

From January to September this year, they continued to successfully test important innovation projects such as gas-free pickling, ball electric polishing, pickling scale, and thin oil layer. Gas-free pickling eliminated the choking smoke during production, improved workers' production conditions, improved product quality, and reduced two processes, saving the country ten tons of nitric acid a year. Adopting the advanced experience of pickling scale, changing manual operation to chemical treatment methods, increased production efficiency more than a million times. Adopting the advanced experience of thin oil layer, the country can save more than 20,000 yuan annually. Recently, they have also successfully trial-produced a rust removal solution. Products such as bearings that could only be rust-removed manually in the past can greatly improve production efficiency after being treated with the rust removal solution, and the finish is even better than that of manual polishing. They used this solution to revive a batch of bearings that were scrapped last year, saving the country nearly 100,000 yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: Huang Zhi, the technology section chief of the Guangzhou Bada Rivet Screw Factory, who attended the National "Heroes Conference," is a man who despises difficulties and is brave in innovation. In the past year, he proposed and implemented seven technical innovation projects with 59 items, creating 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of wealth for the country. From January to September this year, he continued to propose and implement ten technical innovation projects with 13 items, greatly increasing the output and quality of the factory's products. Among them, the thread rolling machine with rotary mode, the large thread rolling diameter reducing machine, and the horizontal heading machine he designed can create wealth of more than 400,000 yuan for the country every year.

Huang Zhi was originally an old technician with more than 30 years of experience. In August and September last year, he referred to the advanced experience of some screw factories in Shanghai and proposed to the leadership to use a punch press to punch holes and then use a tap to manufacture nuts. At the same time, he designed a semi-automatic feeder to replace manual feeding. After the factory implemented these two reforms, the output of nuts increased from 2,200 per day to 40,000. At the beginning of this year, Huang Zhi, in response to the difficulty that the factory did not have steel rolling equipment and had to rely on other factories to supply steel, designed a steel rolling mill that could be manufactured based on the factory's existing manpower and resources. This machine was manufactured and put into production in August this year, and can roll 600 tons of steel sheets annually, solving most of the steel required for the factory's production of daily hardware products. Not long ago, Huang Zhi successfully designed a horizontal heading machine, which can press screw heads of unlimited length. In the past, screws longer than eight feet had to be forged manually, which was both laborious and of poor quality. The creation of this machine not only replaced heavy manual labor, but also greatly increased output and quality.

The process of designing and manufacturing these machines was not smooth sailing for Huang Zhi. He only studied in a private school for a few years and in junior high school for a month, but under the education of the Party, he was brave in breaking superstitions and fighting against difficulties. He often buys a lot of Chinese and foreign technical materials to study, and asks others for help when he can't understand. Each time he makes a new design, he widely solicits opinions from the factory's technicians and modifies them, so that these designs are continuously improved and perfected.

Main Thrust
To carry out mass movements, special attention must be paid to large-scale technical innovation. Because the purpose of mass movements is to develop productivity faster, and technical innovation is precisely an important method to improve labor productivity. Workers say it well: "No matter how big the task is, we are not afraid, we will break through it with innovation!" This sentence profoundly illustrates the great role of technical innovation in completing the national production and construction tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the targets.

Mass movements must continue to surge continuously and cannot rely solely on physical strength. Human physical strength is limited, while intelligence is infinite. Closely combining hard work and clever work, and vigorously carrying out technical innovation, workers will always maintain vigorous energy, and the mass movement will advance wave after wave without end.

From countless facts, we have come to a conclusion: to rapidly increase labor productivity, achieve a balance between work and rest, ensure the increase in product output while also ensuring the improvement of product quality, and maintain the workers' soaring enthusiasm and the vigorous mass movement, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation. We sincerely hope that all enterprises will create new and more brilliant achievements in technical innovation.

    技术大革新　生产大高涨
    赵长生平均二十二天有一项创造　康义隆小组搞革新月月超产　黄志九个月实现了十个革新项目
    据新华社南昌30日电　江西拖拉机制造厂车工赵长生，在四年零七个月的时间内实现较大的技术革新六十五项，平均二十二天就有一项革新创造。在他革新的项目中，有的提高效率达数十倍，因此他在六年零九个月时间内就完成了十三年六个月零三天的工作量，现在已开始做1966年7月份的工作。
    积极主动地想办法，找关键，是赵长生取得技术革新成绩的重要原因。1958年7月，厂里赶制三十马力煤气机，支援农村抗旱。在生产煤气机的主件缸头时，赵长生不分昼夜地同大家研究，结果革新成功了双轮钻缸头的工具，提高工效七倍。今年大战8、9月中，拖拉机零件转间节发生了问题，达不到工时定额，质量也不能保证，严重地影响了生产。赵长生废寝忘食地反复研究如何突破这个难关，终于在技师黄振华协助下，改进了一项工具，提高效率十九倍，使这个零件的质量达到全优，打响了大战8、9月的第一炮。
    赵长生只有高小程度，1951年才进厂当学徒。他经常利用业余时间学习政治理论以及“车工手册”、“机械工人”、“机械制图”等技术书籍，不懂就向老师傅、技术人员请教。这样就使他大大提高了政治思想觉悟和文化技术水平，并且迅速运用到工作中去。
    据新华社西安30日电　国营华山机械厂康义隆氧化小组，从1957年12月成立到现在，实现技术革新七十多项，生产效率成倍提高，为国家节约了大量财富，并月月超额完成生产任务。
    1958年大跃进中，康义隆小组积极响应党的号召，针对生产关键开展技术革新。当时小组工人生产中感到最困难的是，用热氧化法处理零件，需要在摄氏一百五十度左右的温度下操作，很容易发生烧伤和烫伤事故，防锈剂蒸发的气味又往往呛得人头晕，影响工人身体健康。更严重的是常常买不到热氧化所需要的电阻丝，影响生产任务的完成。于是他们就研究将热氧化法改为冷氧化法。经过二百多次失败，试验成功。这项创造提高了生产效率三倍，使这个厂每年节约十六万元，并大大改善了劳动条件，保证了安全生产。
    今年1至9月份他们又继续试验成功了无气体酸洗、滚珠电抛光、酸洗氧化皮、薄油层等重要革新项目。无气体酸洗消灭了生产时呛人的烟雾，改善了工人的生产条件，提高了产品质量，还减少了两道工序，一年能为国家节约十吨硝酸。采用酸洗氧化皮的先进经验，改手工操作为化学处理方法，提高了生产效率百万倍以上。采用薄油层的先进经验，全年能为国家节约二万多元。最近他们又试制成功一种除锈溶液，过去只能用手工擦锈的轴承等产品，经过除锈溶液处理，可以大大提高生产效率，光洁度比用手工打磨的还好。他们用这种溶液复活了去年报废的一批轴承，为国家节约了近十万元。
    据新华社广州30日电　出席全国“群英会”的广州市八达铆钉螺丝厂技术股长黄志，是一个藐视困难、勇于革新的人。他在去年一年中，提出并实现了七项五十九件技术革新项目，为国家创造了六、七十万元财富。今年1至9月，他继续提出并实现了十项十三件技术革新项目，使厂里产品的产量、质量都大大提高，其中他设计的转模式滚牙机、大型滚牙轧径机、卧式打头机，每年可以为国家创造财富四十多万元。
    黄志原来是一个有三十多年工龄的老技工，去年8、9月间，他参考了上海一些螺丝厂的先进经验，向领导上提出改用冲床冲孔，再用丝攻的方法来制造丝母，同时他自己又设计了一个半自动送料机来代替人工送料。厂里实施了这两项改革后，丝母的产量由每天的二千二百只增加到四万只。今年年初，黄志又针对厂里没有轧钢设备，要靠其他工厂供给钢材的困难，设计了一部根据本厂现有人力、物力能够制造的轧钢机。这部机器在今年8月间已经制成并投入生产，每年可轧钢片六百吨，解决了这个厂生产日用五金制品所需要的大部分钢材。不久以前，黄志又设计成功了一部卧式打头机，这部机器能够压打无限长度的螺丝钉头。过去超过八尺长的螺丝就要靠人工锻打，既费力，质量又不好，制成这部机器后，不仅代替了繁重的手工操作，还大大提高了产量和质量。
    黄志在设计和制造这些机器的过程中，并不是一帆风顺的。他小时候只念过几年私塾和一个月初中，但是在党的教育下，他勇于破除迷信，同困难作斗争。他经常购买许多中外的技术资料来研究，看不懂就向别人请教。每次作出一件新的设计时，他又广泛征求厂里技工的意见加以修改，这样就使这些设计不断改进和更加完善。
    主攻方向
    大搞群众运动，要特别注意大搞技术革新。因为群众运动的目的是为了更快地发展生产力，而技术革新恰恰是提高劳动生产率的重要方法，工人们说得好：“任务大，没有啥，搞革新，突破它！”这话十分深刻地说明了技术革新对提前超额完成国家生产建设任务的巨大作用。
    群众运动要持久不断地高涨，不能单靠拼体力。人的体力有限，而智力无穷。把苦干和巧干密切结合起来，大搞技术革新，那么工人便会永远保持旺盛的精力，群众运动便会一浪高一浪地永无止境地前进。
    从无数的事实中，我们得出了一条经验：要高速地提高劳动生产率，做到有劳有逸，要保证产品产量的增长又同时保证产品质量的提高，要使工人的冲天干劲和蓬勃的群众运动持续保持下去，就必须大搞技术革新。我们衷心希望各个企业在技术革新方面创造出新的更加辉煌的成绩。（附图片）
