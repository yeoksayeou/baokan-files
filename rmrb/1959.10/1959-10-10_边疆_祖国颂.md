    Border Region
    ——Ode to the Motherland
    Han Beiping
    The mountains of the motherland's border regions are like a long rainbow,
    Winding for tens of thousands of miles from the northeast to the southwest,
    The Pamir forests are green, the Himalayas wear jade crowns,
    The Hengduan Mountains are like peacocks spreading their colorful wings.
    The waters of the four seas beat against the magnificent coastline,
    The undulating waves have built jade railings,
    The scattered islands are like handsome coral,
    The glittering pearls are Hainan Island and Taiwan.
    Two great flags fly over the motherland's border regions,
    One embroidered with peace, one embroidered with friendship;
    Hospitality is our country's fine tradition,
    White doves fly in the clear sky, carrying olive branches.
    Welcome arches made of flowers are erected on the border regions,
    Under the arches, guests from the five continents are gathered;
    Envoys from Black Africa bring equatorial passion,
    Friends from Latin America, please brush off the dust of your journey;
    Close comrades come from fraternal countries,
    Warm friendship fills their luggage;
    Warriors holding high the banner of anti-colonialism,
    They drink rich wine here.
    The motherland's border regions are sacred and inviolable,
    Embracing the motherland firmly and strongly;
    Showing smiles to guests who come from afar,
    Stretching out arms of steel to robbers.
    Robbers are like those ugly crocodiles,
    Once crawling in groups onto the beaches,
    Like those hungry and ferocious wolf packs,
    Howling and baring their teeth, scurrying in the mountains.
    Knock out their teeth, cut off their claws,
    Grab their tails and throw them into the raging waves,
    A pig's snout poking into the garden must be punished,
    There must be no forgiveness or leniency for invaders.
    The Chinese people are a diligent and courageous people,
    The Chinese leadership is the long-tested Party,
    The great Party leads the great people,
    Building and defending the motherland's border regions.
    Loudly praise you, oh, motherland's border regions,
    You safeguard the free and happy land,
    You are also a strong guarantee of world peace,
    Today you shine with even more dazzling glory.
    (Note: This group of poems, "Ode to the Motherland," consists of ten poems, and this is one of them).

    边疆
    ——祖国颂
    韩北屏
    祖国边疆的山峦像一道长虹，
    迤逦数万里从东北绕向西南，
    葱岭森林绿喜马拉雅戴玉冠，
    横断山脉孔雀展翅彩色斑斓。
    四海之水拍击着壮丽的海岸，
    起伏的波涛筑成了碧玉栏杆，
    星罗棋布的岛屿像俊美珊瑚，
    晶莹的明珠是海南岛和台湾。
    祖国的边疆飘扬着两面大旗，
    一面绣着和平一面绣着友谊；
    好客是我们国家的优良传统，
    晴空下白鸽飞翔衔着橄榄枝。
    边疆上用鲜花扎成欢迎拱门，
    拱门下簇拥着五大洲的客人；
    黑非洲的使者带来赤道激情，
    拉丁美洲的朋友请拂去征尘；
    亲密的同志们来自兄弟之邦，
    温暖的友情充实他们的行囊；
    高举反殖民主义旗帜的战士，
    他们在这里畅饮浓郁的酒浆。
    祖国的边疆呵神圣不可侵犯，
    环抱着祖国大地巩固而坚强；
    对远道而来的客人露出笑容，
    对强盗们就伸出钢铁的臂膀。
    强盗们如同那些丑恶的鳄鱼，
    曾经成群结队地爬上了海滩，
    又如同那些饥饿凶残的狼群，
    嗥叫着张牙舞爪奔窜在山间。
    打掉它们的牙齿斩断那利爪，
    抓住那尾巴扔进激怒的波涛，
    猪鼻伸进花园必须受到惩罚，
    对侵略者绝对不能宽恕轻饶。
    中国人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，
    中国的领导是久经考验的党，
    伟大的党领导着伟大的人民，
    建设着和保卫着祖国的边疆。
    高声赞美你呵，祖国的边疆，
    你维护着自由而幸福的土地，
    你又是世界和平的坚强保障，
    你今天闪耀着更夺目的荣光。
    （注“祖国颂”这一组诗，共十首，这里发表的是其中一首）。
