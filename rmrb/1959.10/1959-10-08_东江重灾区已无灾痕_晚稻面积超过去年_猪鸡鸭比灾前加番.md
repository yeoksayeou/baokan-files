    Eastern River Hard-Hit Areas Have No Trace of Disaster
    Late Rice Acreage Exceeds Last Year; Pigs, Chickens, and Ducks More Than Doubled Compared to Pre-Disaster Levels

    (Our Dispatch) The people in the Eastern River disaster area of Guangdong Province, which suffered a once-in-a-century major flood, have achieved a decisive victory in restoring production and rebuilding their homes.

  In the four hard-hit counties of Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng alone, the planting plan for more than 3.2 million mu of late rice was completed after the Beginning of Autumn, an increase of more than 100,000 mu compared to last year. At the same time, more than 600,000 mu of coarse grains were planted by making use of field edges and corners. These late rice crops are now growing very well, and it is estimated that each mu can produce 500 to 600 jin. If there are no unexpected disasters, the desire to "recover a year's grain in one season" can be realized. Diversified operations have also developed by leaps and bounds, with the number of pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese in the four hard-hit counties more than doubling compared to pre-disaster levels.

    The river embankments and water conservancy projects destroyed by the flood have long been restored to their original state, and the solidity of many large embankments after reconstruction exceeds that of the original sections. Great progress has also been made in rebuilding homes. Up to now, more than 26,000 new houses have been built in the four hard-hit counties, and a large number of disaster victims have moved into their new homes. It is expected that all houses can be built before the Spring Festival.

    The Eastern River disaster area has been able to achieve such amazing achievements in such a short period of time, in addition to the efforts of the people, it has also received huge material support from the central to provincial levels. The People's Communes have demonstrated unparalleled superiority in production self-rescue work. (Yang Wenquan)

    东江重灾区已无灾痕
    晚稻面积超过去年　猪鸡鸭比灾前加番
    本报讯　遭受百年以来特大洪水灾害的广东省东江灾区的人民，在恢复生产、重建家园的工作上，已经取得决定性胜利。
  仅惠阳、博罗、东莞、增城四个重灾县在立秋后就完成了晚稻插秧三百二十多万亩的种植计划，比去年扩大了十万多亩，同时，还利用田边地角扩种杂粮六十多万亩。这些晚稻现在长得很好，估计每亩可产五、六百斤，如无意外灾害，“一造夺回一年粮”的愿望可以实现。多种经营也飞跃发展，四个重灾县的猪、鸡、鸭、鹅比灾前增加一倍多。
    被洪水冲毁的沿江堤围和水利工程，早已恢复原状，不少大围复堤后的坚固程度都超过了原堤段。重建家园的工作也获得很大进展，到最近为止，四个重灾县已建成新居二万六千多间，大批灾民已迁进新居。预计在春节以前可以把全部房屋建好。
    东江灾区能够在这样短的时间内取得惊人的成就，除了人民群众的努力外，还得到了从中央到省的巨大物质支援。人民公社在生产自救工作中显示了无可比拟的优越性。　（杨文全）
