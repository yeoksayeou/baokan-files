Kishi Nobusuke Buys Books
　　Luo Baoqi
According to the West German newspaper "Die Welt," Japanese writer Yamaoka Sohachi wrote a biographical novel "Kishi Nobusuke," portraying Kishi Nobusuke as an "ideal politician." However, after the publication of this novel, no one cared about it. Kishi Nobusuke himself spent a lot of money to buy three thousand copies, saying he wanted to give them to his party friends as "gifts." To know what Kishi Nobusuke was feeling when buying the books, here is a poem as evidence:

　　Recently, a new book came out in Japan,
　　Its name is "Kishi Nobusuke."
　　The new book is on the market but no one buys it,
　　Cobwebs and dust bury it.
　　The news flew into the Prime Minister's Office,
　　Kishi Nobusuke was both ashamed and angry.
　　It's hateful, such a good book and no one buys it.
　　If not for the monk's sake, for the Buddha's sake,
　　We can't let "Kishi Nobusuke" become an unsalable item.
　　Is it that my name isn't popular,
　　Or are the readers "blind and don't recognize Mount Tai"?
　　Am I not an ideal politician?
　　I occupied a seat in the Tojo cabinet,
　　I planned the "Greater East Asia Holy War."
　　If I am not an ideal politician,
　　How could Uncle Sam have plucked me from Sugamo (Note 1)?!
　　Rejoicing in surviving, I vigorously promoted the "Japan Reconstruction League,"
　　Exhausting my efforts to restore the "glory of the Empire."
　　In 1957, I ascended to the throne of Prime Minister,
　　And have been working hard to open up a "new era of Japan-US relations."
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　Regardless of the condemnation of thousands of people, I want to revive the "Special Higher Police" era.
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　Amending the "Security Treaty," Japan must take the lead for the United States.
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　I opened the national treasury to help the financial groups get rich,
　　Under the protection of the Stars and Stripes,
　　I will also help them re-enter Southeast Asia.
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　Severing Sino-Japanese relations, I am a "hero"!
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　Japanese and American financial groups praised me in unison.
　　Who says I am not an ideal politician?
　　……
　　Kishi Nobusuke pondered:
　　It's not surprising that the new book is piling up,
　　But the unsalability of "Kishi Nobusuke" is no ordinary matter.
　　If others don't buy it, I'll buy it,
　　I'll buy three thousand copies of "Kishi Nobusuke" myself,
　　And give them to "party friends as gifts,"
　　Lest the "Kishi Nobusuke" that sleeps on the shelves makes me lose face!

　　(Note 1) In 1948, the United States appreciated Kishi Nobusuke and released him from Sugamo Prison for war criminals. Kishi Nobusuke was moved to tears and said: "My remaining life is a gift." He actively worked hard to revive militarism.

　　岸信介买书
　　罗葆齐
    据西德“世界报”报道，日本作家山冈庄八写了一本传记小说“岸信介”，把岸信介描写成“理想的政治家”。但是，这本小说出版后却无人问津。岸信介自己大掏腰包，买了三千本说是要送给他的党内朋友作“礼物”。要知岸信介买书的心情如何，有诗为证：
    近来日本出新书，
    名字就叫“岸信介”。
    新书上市无人买，
    蛛网烟尘把它埋。
    消息飞进首相府，
    岸信介又是羞来又是怒。
    真可恶，这样好书没人买。
    不看僧面，看佛面，
    总不能让“岸信介”变成滞销货。
    是我的名字不吃香，
    还是读书人“有眼不识泰山”？！ 
    难道我不是理想政治家？
    东条内阁班底占过交椅，
    “大东亚圣战”有我筹划。
    我若不是理想政治家，
    沙姆大叔怎肯从巢鸭（注一）把我提拔？！
    庆余生，我大搞“日本重建联盟”，
    鞠躬尽瘁要恢复“帝国荣光”。
    五七年我登上首相宝座，
    一直为开辟“日美新时代”奔忙。
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
    不顾千夫之指，我要复活“特高”天下。
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
    修改“安全条约”，要日本替美国把头阵打。
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
    我敞开国库帮财阀发家，
    在星条旗的庇护下，
    我还要帮他们重下东南亚。
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
    掐断日中关系“好汉”数咱家！
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
    日美财阀异口同声把我夸。
    谁说我不是理想政治家？
　　……
    岸信介苦思量：
    新书积压无足怪，
    但“岸信介”滞销不比寻常。
    别人不买，我来买，
    三千本“岸信介”我一人买上，
    送给“党内朋友作礼物”，
    免得那长眠货架的“岸信介”把我脸丢光！
    （注一）1948年美国赏识了岸信介，擅自从巢鸭战犯监狱释放了他。岸信介感激涕零，说：“我的余生是一种恩赐”。便积极为复活军国主义效犬马之劳。
