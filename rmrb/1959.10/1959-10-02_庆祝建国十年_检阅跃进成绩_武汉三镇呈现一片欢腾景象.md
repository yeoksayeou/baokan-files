Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 1st: Four hundred and fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Wuhan held a grand rally and parade today to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Today, Wuhan was blessed with clear autumn skies, and all the squares were decorated splendidly. At dawn, the entire city was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, as people excitedly gathered at the central venue in Hankou and the branch venues in Wuchang, Hanyang, Qingshan, and the suburbs. At about 10 o'clock, after Liu Huinong, the mayor of Wuhan, delivered a holiday speech, a vast stream of people began to parade by districts.

Leaders of Hubei Province and Wuhan City reviewed the marching columns in front of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Palace. Workers from Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (Wugang), one of China's three major iron and steel bases, marched at the forefront of the parade. The steel warriors, surrounded by tall models of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces, reported the good news to the motherland: on the eve of National Day—September 30th—the No. 1 open-hearth furnace with a capacity of 250 tons was completed nine months ahead of schedule and produced its first heat of steel; the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces created a high-yield and high-quality record of producing more than 4,000 tons per day. With this, Wugang has stepped into a new historical stage of both ironmaking and steelmaking. This good news aroused enthusiastic cheers. Today, the models of large and small blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters in the parade symbolize that Wuhan has built a relatively complete iron and steel industrial system.

The parade of mechanical workers passed before the reviewing stand. They carried models of large precision machine tools that Wuhan could not produce in the past, as well as huge models of power station boilers, steam turbine generators, rolling mills, and various industrial mechanical equipment, and carried precision instruments such as ultrasonic metal flaw detectors and radio flow meters, marching past with cheers.

Commune members from the suburban people's communes shouted "Long live the people's communes!" in the parade today. They presented the achievements made in the suburbs over the past ten years, especially since the establishment of the people's communes, as a gift to National Day. This year's total output of non-staple foods and sideline production will increase by 61% compared with before communization, including the sown area of vegetables, which has expanded from 80,000 mu before communization to the current 140,000 mu; the number of pigs has increased from 120,000 before communization to more than 170,000; and fish farming has also increased by two times compared with before communization.

Officers and soldiers of the three armed services of the Wuhan troops, strong militia teams, cadres of government organs, members of democratic parties, cultural and scientific workers, students, street residents, and sports and art workers also participated in the grand parade celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    庆祝建国十年　检阅跃进成绩
    武汉三镇呈现一片欢腾景象
    据新华社武汉1日电　武汉四十五万各界人民，今天举行盛大集会和游行，隆重庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年。
    今天，武汉秋高气爽，各个广场上打扮得灿烂辉煌。拂晓，全市锣鼓喧天，人们兴高彩烈地向汉口中心会场和武昌、汉阳、青山、郊区各分会场聚集。十时许，武汉市市长刘惠农作了节日讲话之后，浩大的人流开始分区游行。
    湖北省、武汉市的领导人在中苏友好宫门前，检阅了游行队伍。我国三大钢铁基地之一武钢的工人走在游行队伍的前列。钢铁战士们簇拥着高大的平炉、高炉模型向祖国报喜：国庆节前夕——9月30日，容积二百五十吨的一号平炉提前九个月建成，流出了第一炉钢水，一、二号高炉创造了日产四千多吨的高产优质纪录。到此，武钢已经跨进了既炼铁又炼钢的历史新阶段。这个喜讯引起了人们的热烈欢呼。今天，游行队伍里的大小高炉和平炉、转炉的模型，象征着武汉已经建成了比较完整的钢铁工业体系。
    机械工人的游行队伍走过了检阅台前。他们用汽车载了武汉市过去不能生产的大型精密机床的模型，以及电站锅炉、汽轮发电机、轧钢机等轧钢和各种工业机械设备的巨大模型，抬着超声波金属探伤仪、无线电测流仪等精密仪器，欢呼着走了过来。
    郊区人民公社社员们今天在游行队伍里举臂高呼“人民公社万岁”。他们用郊区十年来特别是成立人民公社以来所取得的成就，向国庆节献礼。今年的副食品、副业生产总产量将比公社化前增长61％，其中蔬菜的播种面积由公社化前八万亩扩大到目前的十四万亩，猪由公社化前十二万头增加到十七万多头；鱼的养殖也比公社化前增加了两倍。
    武汉部队的三军官兵、强大民兵团队、机关干部、民主党派人士、文化科学工作人员、学生、街道居民和体育文艺工作者，也参加了庆祝建国十周年的盛大游行。
