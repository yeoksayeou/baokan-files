Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The People's Liberation Army Railway Corps units, fighting on more than 20 new railway lines across the country with a total length of over 2,000 kilometers, have built on their comprehensive over-fulfillment of their railway construction tasks for September. They are now mustering even greater effort to advance victoriously and strive for a complete success in October, determined to complete this year's railway construction tasks ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Railway Corps officers and soldiers are in high spirits and working with increasing enthusiasm. Since the launch of the "Four Comparisons" red flag competition in September—comparing high output, high quality, conservation, and safety—the progress of the projects has been increasing steadily, with frequent reports of success. In September, a total of 6.39 million cubic meters of earth and stone work was completed, representing 116% of the monthly plan; 1,923 meters of bridges, 112% of the monthly plan; more than 3,220 meters of tunnels excavated, 130.8% of the monthly plan; and 80 kilometers of track laid, 104.4% of the monthly plan. For the entire month, the engineering investment tasks assigned to them by the state were over-fulfilled by 16.5%, an increase of 70% compared to August, reaching the highest level of monthly plan completion this year.

The progress of projects on all lines is advancing rapidly. The Railway Corps unit constructing the Hainan Island Ring Railway completed the 108-kilometer An(you)-Huang(liu) section ahead of schedule on National Day, and it has been officially opened to traffic. The troops working on the Lou(di)-Shao(yang) section of the Xiangqian Line are determined to "Fight hard in October to complete the Lou-Shao Road." Soldiers and civilian workers are fighting day and night to accelerate the completion of the final basic works. The Yong'an railway branch line in Fujian Province, built by a certain unit, has begun track laying. The troops fighting on the Nei(jiang)-Kun(ming) line and the Dianqian line on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau over-fulfilled their September battle tasks ahead of schedule and are striving for a "complete success in October." In the excavation of large tunnel projects such as Yanjaozhai, Qieniao, and Dingjiacun, the soldiers pioneered new records of one hundred meters and more than one hundred meters of tunnel excavation in a single hole in September.

In the heated red flag competition, all construction units have launched a socialist labor competition of "you catch up with me." A certain regiment of the Railway Corps on the Wumeng Mountain construction site of the Neikun Line launched a competition to "create sharp knife work teams," resulting in a large number of "sharp knife work teams," "excellent pneumatic drill operators," and "safe blasting experts," and the efficiency of the project has been increasing by leaps and bounds, overfulfilling the entire month's task eleven days ahead of schedule. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit building the Hangzhou-Changxing Railway adopted the method of "appointing generals to compete" in the ditching project of the Jimaling Tunnel, which increased the project efficiency to an average of 6.5 cubic meters per day, reaching 126.41% of the state quota. Under the slogan "Competition is for rivals, mutual aid is for brothers," the units have promoted the communist style. In the tunnel excavation project, the officers and soldiers of one company not only overfulfilled their tasks, but also promptly introduced advanced experience to fraternal companies and sent excellent pneumatic drill operators to participate in the construction, so that the fraternal companies quickly caught up and made progress together.

The Railway Corps units are vigorously grasping technological innovation and vigorously promoting advanced machinery and construction methods, so that hard work is combined with skillful work. According to incomplete statistics, in the past month or so, a total of 36 advanced machines and more than 6,860 pieces have been promoted, and various advanced construction methods such as "mortar rubble squeezing mortar," "full-section excavation," and "gourd cannon" have been adopted. There has also been a major technological innovation, focusing on tunnel construction, to further solve key problems such as ventilation, dust prevention, operation of pneumatic drill racks, blasting, and slag removal. A certain unit constructing the Wumeng Mountain Tunnel also created and used high-altitude lines, steel rails, wooden troughs and other transportation methods, which increased the efficiency of the project seven times. The diesel tamper modified by a certain unit can tamp 80 square meters per hour on average, which is ten times more efficient than manual tamping. At the same time, while ensuring the quality of the project, the units have also saved a large amount of cement, wood, fuel, etc. According to preliminary calculations of only seven units, the value is more than 234,000 yuan.

　　竞赛是对手　互助是兄弟
    铁道兵各部并肩赶筑新线路
    新华社13日讯　奋战在全国各地二十多条、总长两千多公里新建铁路线上的人民解放军铁道兵部队，在全面超额完成9月份筑路任务的基础上，鼓足更大的干劲，乘胜猛进，争取10月满堂红，并决心要提前十天至半月完成今年的筑路任务。
    铁道兵官兵们在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，意气风发，愈干愈有劲。从9月份开展比高产、比优质、比节约、比安全的“四比”红旗竞赛以来，工程进度节节上升，捷报频传。9月份共完成土石方工程六百三十九万立方，为月计划的116％；桥梁一千九百二十三米，为月计划的112％；开挖隧道三千二百二十多米，为月计划的130.8％；铺轨八十公里，为月计划的104.4％。全月超额16.5％完成了国家给它们的工程投资任务，比8月份增长了70％，达到今年以来完成月计划的最高水平。
    各条线路工程进度都在突飞猛进。修建海南岛环岛铁路的铁道兵某部，在国庆节提前建成了长达一百零八公里的安（游）黄（流）段，并正式通车。在湘黔线娄（底）邵（阳）段施工的部队，决心“大战10月，修通娄邵路”，战士和民工们昼夜奋战，加速完成最后的基本工程。某部修建的福建省永安铁路支线，已开始铺轨。战斗在云贵高原内（江）昆（明）线和滇黔线上的部队，提前超额完成了9月大战的任务，力争“十月满堂红”。战士们在开挖岩脚寨，且鸟和丁家村等大隧道工程中，首创9月里成峒百米和超过百米的新纪录。
    在热火朝天的红旗竞赛中，各施工部队都开展了“你追我赶”的社会主义劳动竞赛。内昆线乌蒙山工地上的铁道兵某团，开展了“创造尖刀工班”的竞赛，涌现出大批的“尖刀工班”和“优秀风枪手”、“万炮安全爆破手”，工程效率一跃再跃，提前十一天超额完成全月的任务。修建杭州—长兴铁路的某部官兵，在鸡马岭隧道拉沟工程中，采取“点将打擂竞赛”的方法，使工程效率提高到平均每日六点五立方米，达到国家定额的126.41％。在“竞赛是对手，互助是兄弟”的口号下，各部队发扬了共产主义风格。某部一连官兵在开挖隧道工程中，不仅自己超额完成了任务，而且把先进经验及时地介绍给兄弟连队，并派去优秀的风枪手参加施工，使兄弟连队也很快地追赶上来，齐头跃进。
    铁道兵各部队猛抓技术革新，大力推广先进机具和施工方法，使苦干与巧干相结合。据不完全统计，近一个多月来，共推广各种先进机具三十六项、六千八百六十多件，推广采用了“浆砌片石挤浆”、“全断面开挖”、“葫芦炮”等多种先进施工方法，并大闹技术革新，以隧道施工为重点，进一步解决了通风、防尘、操纵风枪架、爆破、出碴等关键问题。乌蒙山大隧道施工的某部，还创制和使用了高线、钢轨、木槽等运输法，使工程效率提高七倍。某部改制的柴油打夯机，平均每小时打八十平方米，比人力打夯提高工效十倍。同时，各部队在保证工程质量的前提下，还节约了大量的水泥、木料和油料等，仅七个单位的初步计算，就价值二十三万四千多元。（附图片）
