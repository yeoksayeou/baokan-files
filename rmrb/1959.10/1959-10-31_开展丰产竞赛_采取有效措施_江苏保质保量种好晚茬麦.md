    Launch a High-Yield Competition and Take Effective Measures
    Jiangsu Ensures Good Quality and Quantity of Late-Season Wheat
    Nanjing Dispatch, October 30th: A vigorous high-yield competition movement of "late-season surpassing early-season" wheat has been launched in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province.
    This year, Jiangsu Province has over 8 million mu of late-season wheat, accounting for 20% of the total sown area of the three wheats (early-maturing wheat, barley, and wheat). In the past, due to the late stubble, tight season, and insufficient labor and animal power, these late-season wheats were not sown in time, resulting in poor growth and low yields. In this year's autumn sowing campaign, rural cadres and commune members have closely implemented the requirements of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee to "ensure the season, ensure the area, and ensure the quality," seizing the crucial key to increasing production by planting and managing late-season wheat well, and launched a high-yield competition movement of "late-season surpassing early-season." In the southern Jiangsu area, where late rice acreage is large, while rushing to plant mid-season wheat, efforts are being made to free up labor to make full preparations for planting late-season wheat well. Wujiang County loudly proposed the fighting goal of "Late wheat sowing must not pass the Beginning of Winter, yield doubles!" and then rationally arranged 60,000 laborers to launch a concentrated effort to accumulate over 70 million dan of fertilizer, transporting it to the fields while accumulating it, with each mu of late-season wheat receiving over 140 dan of base fertilizer, and exchanging for improved wheat varieties such as "Ai Li Duo" and "Six Pistils" from other places. In the Xuhuai area, where the sowing season is earlier, as soon as late-season wheat sowing began, the masses were fully mobilized to discuss whether the yield of late-season wheat could catch up with early-season wheat, eliminating the erroneous ideas of some people who said "late-season has low yield" and "fast and good cannot be combined." Therefore, this year, the sowing time of late-season wheat is generally more than half a month earlier than last year.
    In the high-yield competition movement of "late-season surpassing early-season," Party committees at all levels have launched a mass movement, organizing inspection and promotion groups of ten thousand people from the county to the commune, and carrying out mass competitions, comparisons, and inspections through on-site meetings and other forms. Huaiyin City, in the rush to plant late-season crops, successively organized more than 1,000 cadres and commune member representatives from twelve suburban communes to visit the Sanshu Commune, which had a fast pace and good quality of late-season sowing, greatly promoting the development of the "late-season surpassing early-season" movement. The conditions of Jingjiang Commune in this city were better than those of Sanshu Commune, but the progress of late-season sowing was slower than that of Sanshu Commune. After visiting the progress and specifications and quality of late-season sowing in Sanshu Commune, they rationally arranged labor, organized more than 6,000 people to completely plant more than 9,500 mu of late-season wheat in four days, and the sowing quality surpassed that of Sanshu Commune. Hu She Brigade of Yinhe Commune in Siyang County had more late-season and less early-season crops, while Feng She Brigade had more early-season and less late-season crops. These two brigades signed a cooperation contract to support each other, and as a result, the early and late-season wheat of both teams were sown more than ten days earlier than in the same period last year.
    In the rush to plant late-season crops, all localities have tried every means to improve the sowing quality of late-season crops and actively implemented yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, sufficient base fertilizer, selection of improved varieties, and rational close planting. In the Xuzhou and Huaiyin special districts, where the land is vast and the population is sparse and there is more land and less labor, the broad masses of commune members have changed the past habit of planting late-season wheat in vain, and have increased from one or two plowings to three or four plowings before sowing, generally achieving specifications and quality such as intensive cultivation and fine harrowing, careful land preparation, and crushing soil to preserve moisture.

### 开展丰产竞赛　采取有效措施  江苏保质保量种好晚茬麦

    开展丰产竞赛　采取有效措施
    江苏保质保量种好晚茬麦
    本报南京30日电　江苏省农村掀起轰轰烈烈的“晚茬超早茬”的丰产竞赛运动。
    今年，江苏省共有晚茬麦八百多万亩，占三麦（元麦、大麦、小麦）播种面积的20％。过去，这些晚茬麦，由于茬口晚，季节紧，劳力、畜力不足，播种不及时，所以生长不好，产量较低。在今年的秋种运动中，农村干部和社员紧紧贯彻了江苏省委提出的“保季节、保面积、保质量”的要求，抓住了种好、管好晚茬麦这一重要的增产关键，开展了“晚茬超早茬”的丰产竞赛运动。在晚稻面积较大的苏南地区，一面抢种中茬麦，一面腾出劳力为种好晚茬麦作充分准备。吴江县响亮提出：“晚麦播种不过立冬关，产量成倍翻”的奋斗目标后，合理安排六万个劳力突击积肥七千多万担，边积边运送到田头，每亩晚茬麦基肥达到一百四十多担，并从外地换进“矮粒多”、“六柱头”等小麦良种。在播种季节较早的徐淮地区，晚茬麦播种一开始，就充分发动群众开展晚茬产量能不能赶早茬等问题的讨论，扫除了一些人所谓“晚茬低产”、“快好不可兼得”的错误思想，因此，今年晚茬麦的播种时间，一般都比去年提早了半个多月。
    在“晚茬超早茬”的丰产竞赛运动中，各级党委大搞群众运动，从县到公社组织万人检查团、促进团，通过现场会议等形式，开展群众性的大赛大比大查运动。淮阴市在抢种晚茬作物中，先后组织十二个郊区公社的干部、社员代表一千多人，到晚茬播种进度快、质量好的三树公社参观，大大促进了“晚茬超早茬”运动的开展。这个市的靖江公社的条件比三树公社好，但是晚茬播种的进度却比三树公社慢，在参观三树公社晚茬播种的进度和规格质量后，合理安排劳力，组织六千多人以四天时间全部种完九千五百多亩晚茬麦，播种质量超过了三树公社。泗阳县阴河公社胡社大队晚茬多，早茬少，冯社大队早茬多，晚茬少，这两个大队签订协作合同，互相支援，结果两个队的早、晚茬麦都比去年同期提前十多天播种结束。
    在抢种晚茬作物中，各地都千方百计提高了晚茬的播种质量，积极贯彻深耕深翻、施足基肥、精选良种和合理密植等增产措施。地广人稀、地多劳少的徐州、淮阴专区，广大社员改变了过去晚茬麦白种下田的习惯，并从过去一犁、二犁下种，提高到三犁、四犁下种，普遍达到精耕细耙、整地精细、碎土保墒等规格质量。　（姜韦才）
