Give Play to the Power of Small Cement Enterprises
Our Commentator

A new force that has emerged on the cement industry front since the Great Leap Forward last year – a large number of small cement enterprises – is flying wing to wing with large enterprises. After rectification, consolidation, and improvement, and the implementation of technological transformation and improved management, the production of small cement enterprises in various regions has greatly developed. From January to September, small-scale enterprises produced more than 810,000 tons of cement, and small-scale indigenous plants produced more than 10,000 tons of cement. According to a survey of nine provinces, costs have been reduced by 25% compared to the first half of the year, and coupled with savings in transportation costs, the difference with large-scale enterprises is almost negligible. Now, the vast majority of those that are in constant production have switched from indigenous to modern methods, achieving mechanized and semi-mechanized production. By the end of this year, the production capacity of these small-scale enterprises will reach six million tons, equivalent to one-half of that of large-scale factories. This is a great victory for the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" in the cement industry.

The achievements of vigorously developing small-scale cement industries are enormous. However, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements. In the future, China's national economy will continue to leap forward at a more magnificent pace; next year's industrial and agricultural production and capital construction will also see a great situation of continued leap forward. This situation requires the workers on the national cement industry front to produce more and better cement to meet the needs of the industrial and agricultural fronts and capital construction. This is the task facing cement industry workers. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the current favorable situation, continue to criticize right-leaning thoughts, hold high the red banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, conscientiously implement the policy of "walking on two legs," exert all efforts, consolidate and continue to develop the production upsurge that has already formed on the cement industry front; work hard for two months, and strive to complete this year's production tasks twenty to twenty-five days ahead of schedule, and make preparations for continued leap forward next year.

In order to achieve this task, on the one hand, all measures must be taken to fully tap the production potential of existing large-scale enterprises, and the accelerated construction of large-scale enterprises must be grasped, especially to ensure that capital construction projects put into production this year are completed as early as possible, so that large-scale enterprises can fully play their backbone role. On the other hand, it is necessary to grasp the production and construction work of small-scale enterprises, better play the role of small cement enterprises, and put small-scale enterprises in an appropriate position. All enterprises should launch mass movements, vigorously learn from and promote advanced experiences, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, and more widely and deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to ensure that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses continues to run high. At present, the work of small-scale enterprises in various regions is still very uneven, and it is necessary to launch a upsurge of learning from the advanced, competing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Through technological innovation, the backward should catch up with the advanced, and the advanced should become even more advanced.

Improving enterprise management and further improving the management level of small-scale enterprises is an important link in improving enterprise production. To this end, enterprise leaders should take all measures to improve the operating skills of workers, strengthen equipment maintenance, and fully utilize existing equipment capabilities; strengthen technical management and further improve cement quality; strengthen planning management, organize close connections between various production links, and ensure balanced production; strengthen cost management, improve labor organization, save expenses, implement economic accounting, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs; vigorously improve the supply and transportation of raw materials, materials, and fuel, and ensure the consolidation and sustained development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. In establishing and improving enterprise management systems, it is necessary to combine them with large-scale mass movements, conscientiously implement the "two participations, three combinations" system, and further bring into full play the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of workers.

Actively helping people's communes to run small-scale indigenous cement plants is also an important task at present. Efforts should be organized to help them summarize production experience, improve production technical level and labor efficiency, especially in those places with good resource conditions, efforts should be made to carry out tool innovation and try to appropriately improve the level of technical equipment, so as to promote the rapid transformation of small-scale indigenous enterprises into small-scale modern enterprises.

Small cement enterprises are an important force in China's cement industry. It is hoped that all regions will strengthen the leadership of large-scale enterprises while grasping the leadership of small-scale cement enterprises, so that small-scale cement enterprises and large-scale enterprises will work hand in hand to make greater contributions to completing this year's tasks ahead of schedule and over fulfilling them, and to preparing for next year's continued leap forward.

    发挥小型水泥企业的威力
    本报评论员
    水泥工业战线在去年大跃进以来突起的一支新军——大批小型水泥企业，正在和大型企业比翼齐飞。各地的小型水泥企业，经过整顿、巩固、提高，实行了技术改造，改进了管理，生产得到了很大的发展。1至9月份小洋企业共生产了八十一万吨以上的水泥，小土厂生产了一万吨以上的水泥。据九个省的调查，成本比上半年降低了25％，加上运输费用的节约，已和大洋企业相差无几。现在，凡是常年进行生产的，绝大部分都由土转洋，实现了机械化、半机械化的生产。到今年年底，这些小洋企业的生产能力，将达到六百万吨，相当于大洋厂的二分之一。这是党的两条腿走路的方针在水泥工业上的一大胜利。
    大办小型水泥工业的成绩是巨大的。但是，我们决不能满足于现有的成就。今后我国国民经济将以更雄伟的步伐继续跃进；明年工农业生产和基本建设也将出现一个继续跃进的大好形势。这个形势，要求全国水泥工业战线上的职工生产更多更好的水泥，供应工农业战线和基本建设的需要。这就是摆在水泥工业职工面前的任务。因此，必须抓住当前的大好形势，继续批判右倾思想，更高地举起总路线、大跃进的红旗，认真贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，鼓足干劲，把水泥工业战线已经形成的生产高潮，巩固和继续发展下去；大干两个月，力争提前二十天到二十五天完成今年生产任务，并做好明年继续跃进的准备工作。
    为了实现这个任务，一方面要采取一切措施，充分挖掘现有大洋企业的生产潜力，抓紧大洋企业基本建设的加速施工，特别是保证今年投入生产的基建项目尽早完工，充分发挥大洋企业的骨干作用。另一方面，就需要抓紧小洋企业的生产和建设工作，更好地发挥小型水泥企业的作用，把小型企业放在适当的地位。各个企业都应该大搞群众运动，大力学习和推广先进经验，大搞技术革新和技术革命，更广泛深入地开展增产节约运动，保证群众的革命干劲不断高涨。当前各地小型企业的工作还很不平衡，需要掀起一个学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮，通过技术革新，使落后的赶上先进，先进的更先进。
    改进企业管理，进一步提高小型企业的管理水平，是提高企业生产的重要一环。为此，企业的领导人员应当采取一切措施，提高工人的操作技术，加强设备维修，充分发挥现有设备能力；加强技术管理，进一步提高水泥质量；加强计划管理，组织各个生产环节密切衔接，保证均衡地生产；加强成本管理，改善劳动组织，节约开支，实行经济核算，提高劳动生产率，降低成本；大力改进原料、材料、燃料的供应和运输工作，保证增产节约运动巩固、持续地发展下去。在建立和健全企业管理制度时，必须和大搞群众运动相结合，认真贯彻执行“两参三结合”制度，使职工的革命积极性和创造性进一步充分发挥出来。
    积极帮助人民公社办好小土水泥厂，也是当前的一项重要工作。应该组织力量帮助他们总结生产经验，提高生产技术水平和劳动效率，特别是那些资源条件好的地方，要努力进行工具革新，设法适当提高技术装备水平，促使小土企业迅速向小洋企业转化。
    小型水泥企业是我国水泥工业中的一支重要的力量。希望各地在加强大洋企业的领导的同时，抓紧对小型水泥企业的领导，使小型水泥企业和大洋企业携手并进，为提前超额完成今年的任务，为准备明年的继续跃进作出更大的贡献。
