Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 27th. The Cuban Presidential Palace announced today that President Dorticós rejected "the hypocritical opinions and views expressed by (U.S. Ambassador) Bonsal and his government." It was revealed that the U.S. Ambassador, during a meeting with the Cuban President, stated that the U.S. government hoped Cuba would reconsider its policies and attitude towards the United States.

The Presidential Palace's statement was issued after President Dorticós received U.S. Ambassador Bonsal today.

The statement from the Presidential Palace emphasized that the U.S. government's opinions and views were unreasonable.

The statement pointed out that the Cuban Revolutionary Government is considering sending a note to the U.S. government stating Cuba's position on the issues raised by Ambassador Bonsal to President Dorticós.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 28th. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 27th saying that U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Bonsal called on Cuban President Dorticós that day, requesting the Cuban government to "re-examine its policies and attitudes toward the United States." The statement denied the responsibility of the United States for the recent series of anti-Cuban conspiracies, while at the same time putting great pressure on Cuba. It said in a threatening tone that "the U.S. government is seriously disturbed by the current relations between the U.S. and Cuba." This statement issued by the U.S. State Department amid the recent new wave of U.S. interference in Cuba further exposed the true face of U.S. interventionists.

Despite the fact that the United States blatantly violates the basic norms of international relations, condones and supports aircraft taking off from bases in Florida and Miami in the United States to continuously carry out armed violations of Cuban airspace, and U.S. officials and official agencies have already admitted these facts, the U.S. State Department's statement shamelessly accused the Cuban government's legitimate accusations against the U.S. authorities of "poisoning the atmosphere of trust in neighborly relations."

The statement further expressed dissatisfaction with Cuba's domestic land reform and economic restructuring, believing that these measures "affect the rights of U.S. citizens and U.S. companies as stipulated under international law." Everyone knows that the United States recently sent a note to the Cuban government threatening to require advance cash payment for compensation for expropriated U.S. properties, otherwise it would retaliate by reducing Cuba's sugar import quota.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 27th. The Cuban Cabinet meeting held tonight decided to amend the constitution in order to restore the Revolutionary Court to punish counter-revolutionary criminals. According to the constitution, the cabinet will continue to hold a meeting tomorrow to approve the above decision.

The cabinet meeting also passed a petroleum law abolishing all concessions, stipulating that the above-mentioned concessions are public and social wealth.

The above draft law was drafted by the advisory group appointed by Major Guevara, who is now in charge of the country's industrialization work.

Cuba's new petroleum law will affect the interests of thirty-five foreign companies, including Shell Oil, Esso Oil, and Mobil Oil. From 1938 to the present, foreign companies have invested $60 million in Cuba to drill oil wells, and a total of 227 oil wells have been drilled. Cuba's oil reserves are estimated at 2.612 billion barrels.

The petroleum concessions granted to the companies by past governments amounted to 44 million hectares, of which 20 million hectares were undeveloped, constituting so-called reserved "mining concessions." The remaining 24 million hectares are being exploited by thirty-five foreign companies.

The cabinet meeting also passed a mining law that amended the laws promulgated by Batista in the past. The new law stipulates that all minerals exported from Cuba will be subject to a 25% tax, while domestic use will only be taxed at 5%. The three major U.S. companies mining nickel, cobalt, and copper in Oriente Province are Moa Bay Mining Company, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and Nicaro Nickel Company. This law will reduce their income by a quarter.

    美国大使公然出面威胁要古巴改变政策
    古巴总统严词拒斥美国干涉
    通过石油法矿业法限制美国资本盘剥
    据新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴总统府今天宣布，多尔蒂科斯总统拒绝了“（美国大使）邦沙尔及其政府所表示的虚伪的意见和看法”。据透露，美国大使在会见古巴总统时曾经表示，美国政府希望古巴重审它对美国的政策和态度。
    总统府的这项声明是在多尔蒂科斯总统今天接见美国大使邦沙尔以后发表的。
    总统府的声明强调指出，美国政府的意见和看法毫无道理。
    声明指出，古巴革命政府正在考虑向美国政府提出照会，表明古巴对邦沙尔大使向多尔蒂科斯总统所提出的问题的立场。
    据新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院27日发表声明说，美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔在这一天拜会了古巴总统多尔蒂科斯，要求古巴政府“重新审查它对美国的政策和态度”。声明抵赖美国对最近一连串反古巴阴谋活动所应负的责任，同时对古巴大肆施加压力，它用威胁的口吻说，“美国政府对古美两国目前的关系感到严重不安”。美国国务院在美国最近掀起的干涉古巴的新浪潮中所发表的这篇声明，进一步暴露了美国干涉者的真面目。
    尽管美国公然违反国际关系的基本准则，纵容和支持从美国佛罗里达州和迈阿密的基地起飞的飞机连续武装侵犯古巴领空，美国官员和官方机构并且已经承认这些事实，美国国务院声明却无耻地反噬古巴政府对美国官方所提出的正当指责是“毒化邻国关系中的信任气氛”。
    声明进一步对古巴国内土地改革和经济改组的工作表示不满，认为这些措施“影响根据国际法所规定的美国公民和美国公司的权利”。谁都知道，美国最近曾照会古巴政府，威胁必须以现金预先支付对征用的美国地产的赔偿费，否则就要以削减古巴糖的进口份额来报复。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　今天晚上举行的古巴内阁会议决定修改宪法，以便恢复革命法庭，用来制裁反革命罪犯。根据宪法规定，内阁将在明天继续举行会议以便批准上述决议。
    内阁会议上同时通过了废除一切租让地的石油法，这项法律规定上述租让地为公共和社会财富。
    上述法律草案是由格瓦拉少校任命的顾问团起草的，格瓦拉现在负责国家工业化的工作。
    古巴新的石油法将触及三十五家外国公司的利益。其中包括壳牌石油公司、埃索石油公司和美孚油公司。从1938年到现在，外国企业投资在古巴用来开凿油井的资本达六千万美元，共开凿了二百二十七眼油井。古巴石油藏量估计达二十六亿一千二百万桶。
    过去历届政府给与各家公司的石油租让地为四千四百万公顷，其中有二千万公顷没有开发，构成了所谓储备的“矿山特许权”。其余的二千四百万公顷由三十五家外国企业进行开采。
    内阁会议还通过了矿业法，这项法律修改了过去巴蒂斯塔颁布的法律。新法律规定对古巴出口的一切矿物征收25％的赋税，本国使用则只征5％的税。在奥连特省开采镍、钴和铜的这三家主要美国公司是莫贝矿业公司、伯利恒钢铁公司和尼卡罗镍公司。这项法律将使它们的收入减少四分之一。
