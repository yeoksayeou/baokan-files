Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th - Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing, said when talking about the great significance of the Soviet Union's automatic interplanetary station taking pictures of the far side of the moon: Since the invention of powerful telescopes, humanity's understanding of the terrain of the moon's near side can be said to be clearer than that of the Earth. But no one has ever known what the situation is on its far side. Due to the moon's speed in orbit, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and the moon's axis of rotation not being perpendicular to its orbital plane, but having an inclination of more than six degrees, the lunar surface that we can see can slightly exceed half of the entire spherical area. 41% of the lunar surface, hidden on the far side of the moon, has never had the opportunity to meet the world. Now, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station has sent the photographs of the far side of the moon it took back to Earth via radio facsimile technology. The mystery of the ages, once unveiled, it is no wonder that all mankind should cheer for the Soviet Union's great scientific achievement.

Zhang Yuzhe said: The achievements of Soviet science and technology in the field of space rockets have unfolded a magnificent and brilliant prospect for mankind to conquer outer space. The far side of the moon, which could only be dreamed of in the past, can now be seen in its true form. To gather the essence of Taibai (Venus), to build an astronomical observatory like the Guanghan Palace, and to use the disparity between the heat and cold of the day and night regions of the moon to build a thermoelectric power station, these are all things that can gradually become a reality in the not-too-distant future.

    张钰哲谈苏联拍摄月球背影伟大意义
    千古哑谜　一旦揭开
    新华社南京20日电　中国科学院南京紫金山天文台台长张钰哲谈到苏联自动行星际站摄取到月球背面照片的伟大意义时说：人类自从发明了强有力的望远镜以来，它对于月球正面山谷形势的了解可以说是比对于地球还要清楚。但是它背面的情况如何，就从来没有人知道了。由于月球在轨道上运行的速度，时快时慢，月球自转轴和它的轨道平面不相垂直，而有六度多的倾斜，我们所能看到月球的表面，可以稍为超过整个球面面积之半。有41％的月球面积，隐藏在月球的背面，从来没有和世人见面的机会。现在苏联自动行星际站，把它所拍的月球背面的照片，借无线电传真的技术，送到地球上来，千古哑谜，一旦揭开，无怪乎全人类都要为着苏联这个科学上的伟大成就而欢呼。
    张钰哲说：苏联科学技术在宇宙火箭方面的成就，展开了人类征服宇宙空间一幅辉煌灿烂的前景。从前只能付诸梦想的月球背面，现在却可以看到它的真相了。采太白之精英，设广寒宫阙的天文台，利用月球昼夜区域寒热之悬殊，建立温差电站，这都是在不太遥远的将来就可以逐步变成现实的了。
