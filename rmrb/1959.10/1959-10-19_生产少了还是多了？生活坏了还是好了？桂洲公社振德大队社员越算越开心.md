　　Less Production or More? Worse Life or Better?
　　Guizhou Commune Zhen De Brigade Members Become Happier the More They Calculate
　　This newspaper reports that the Zhen De Brigade of the Guizhou Commune in Fan Shun County, Guangdong, through carrying out a socialist education movement, using the method of everyone calculating accounts and every team calculating accounts, enabled commune members to deeply recognize the great achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward, and clearly and vividly calculate the superiority of the socialist system and the people's commune. They focused on calculating twelve major accounts: Were the various productions such as economic crops, paddy fields, pigs, three birds (chickens, ducks, geese), and dairy cows better or worse? Was more construction or more destruction done? Were the public accumulation of the commune more or less? Were there more or fewer daily necessities? Did income increase or decrease? Did commune members eat more or less grain? Were there more or fewer marriages? Were more or fewer water conservancy projects undertaken? Were there more or fewer students? Were the collective welfare undertakings better or worse? Were there more or fewer births? Was the future better or worse? And so on.

　　Some upper-middle peasants said: "Last year's Great Leap Forward only focused on agricultural production, squeezing out sideline occupations. The reduction of pigs and three birds is like a daughter-in-law running away from home." But everyone calculated that not only did agricultural crops significantly increase, but pigs and three birds also increased in the whole brigade. For example, in 1957, there were 944 pigs raised, which increased to 2,380 last year, an increase of more than one and a half times; the number of three birds in the previous year was 4,500, and last year it was 6,900, an increase of more than half. The poor peasants said: "It's not a daughter-in-law running away, but marrying a daughter-in-law."

　　Upper-middle peasant Huo Yao said that the Great Leap Forward destroyed more houses and built fewer. However, everyone calculated that last year only "destroyed" twelve dilapidated small mud houses, but newly built thirteen large brick houses, rebuilt three large bungalows, and also built new-style large silkworm houses, grand pigsties, as well as public canteens and children's playgrounds. How could it be said that more were demolished and fewer were built?

　　In the calculation, the commune members also focused on calculating the living accounts. In the whole brigade of 5,369 people, from January to August before communization last year, the average monthly grain consumption per person was 25.75 jin; from November last year after communization to August this year, the average monthly grain consumption per person was 27.2 jin, and if the part of sweet potato converted into rice is added, it was 28.07 jin in total, which is an increase of 9% compared with before. In 1957, the total distribution amount of the whole brigade was 234,697 yuan, and the total distribution amount last year was 275,253 yuan (both numbers are missing for the Heping Production Team), an increase of 17% last year compared with 1957. In 1957, there were 317 households with overdrafts, which were basically eliminated last year. In terms of meat food, the whole team ate 16 pigs in the previous year and 116 pigs last year, an increase of more than six times; in terms of clothing, the whole team made a total of 2,657 new clothes in the previous year and 3,651 sets last year, an increase of 38%.

　　However, during this period, some upper-middle peasants had some reduced income because they had no speculative business to do. For example, the income of upper-middle peasant Wu Shanyou in 1957 included 279 yuan of ill-gotten wealth: he sold milk, mixing three jin of clear water for every ten jin; once, he went to Yangjiang to buy big goose flowers to sell, buying them for three yuan and five jiao each and selling them for four yuan and two jiao each, earning more than forty yuan at once. After deducting this ill-gotten wealth, his income last year was still twelve yuan more than his normal income in 1957.

　　After the members of the Zhen De Production Brigade distinguished between the major rights and wrongs of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune issues in 1958, they immediately set off a high tide of overproduction and increased harvest. During the calculation and debate, the commune members fought hard for three days and three nights, eliminating all the pests in the 1,100 mu of late rice fields, and added 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to the 378 mu of backward fields, changing the appearance of most of the backward fields. The Da Zhangshu Production Team mobilized the whole team to eliminate insects on the night after the calculation and debate, and caught all the leaf-rolling insects in more than ten mu of paddy fields overnight. The commune members also used their rest time to launch a campaign of planting 50 banana trees per person, planting more than 21,000 banana trees in three days.

### 生产少了还是多了？生活坏了还是好了？桂洲公社振德大队社员越算越开心

　　生产少了还是多了？生活坏了还是好了？
　　桂洲公社振德大队社员越算越开心
    本报讯　广东番顺县桂洲公社振德大队在开展社会主义教育运动中，通过人人算账，队队算账的办法，使社员深刻地认识去年大跃进的伟大成就，把社会主义制度和人民公社优越性鲜明地生动地算了出来。他们着重算十二笔大账：经济作物、禾田、生猪、三鸟（鸡、鸭、鹅）、奶牛等各项生产是好了还是坏了？建设多了还是破坏多了？公社公共积累多了还是少了？日用品多了还是少了？收入增加了还是减少了？社员吃的粮食增加了还是减少了？结婚的人多了还是少了？水利办多了还是少了？学生多了还是少了？集体福利事业是好了还是坏了？生孩子多了还是少了？前途是好了还是坏了？等等。
    有些上中农说：“去年大跃进只抓了农业生产，挤掉了副业。生猪、三鸟减少了，等于家里跑了一个媳妇。”但大家算出，全大队不仅农作物显著增产，就是生猪、三鸟也有增加。如1957年饲养生猪九百四十四头，去年增至二千三百八十头，增加一倍半以上；三鸟，前年是四千五百只，去年是六千九百只，也增加了一半多。贫农说：“不是跑了个媳妇，而是娶了个媳妇。”
    上中农霍耀说大跃进破坏的房屋多，新建的少了。但是大家算出：去年只不过“破坏”了十二间风雨飘摇的小泥屋，但是新建了十三间大砖屋，改建了三间大平房，还有新式的大蚕房、宏大的猪舍，还有公共食堂、儿童乐园。怎么是拆的多，建的少了呢？
    在算账中，社员们还着重算了生活账。全大队五千三百六十九人，去年公社化前的1月至8月份，平均每人每月用粮二十五点七五斤；从去年11月公社化后到今年8月，平均每人每月用粮二十七点二斤，如果加上番薯折米部分，共二十八点零七斤，即比以前增加了9％。1957年，全大队分配总金额为二十三万四千六百九十七元，去年分配总额为二十七万五千二百五十三元（两数均缺和平生产队），去年比1957年增加17％。1957年超支户三百一十七户，去年基本上消灭了。肉食方面，全队前年吃猪十六头，去年一百一十六头，增加六倍多；衣着方面，前年全队共做新衣二千六百五十七套，去年做了三千六百五十一套，增加38％。
    但是，在这期间，也有个别上中农因为没有投机取巧的买卖做而减少了一些收入。例如上中农吴善有，1957年的收入中有二百七十九元是属于不义之财：他卖牛奶，十斤就混三斤清水；有一次，他到阳江买大鹅花回来卖，买时三元五角一只，卖时四元二角一只，一次就赚了四十多元。把这笔不义之财减去以后，他去年的收入比1957年的正常收入还增加十二元。
    振德生产大队的社员分清了1958年大跃进和人民公社问题的大是大非之后，立即掀起一个超产多收运动的高潮。在算账和辩论期间，社员苦战了三日三夜，把一千一百亩晚稻田的虫害全部消灭，在三百七十八亩落后田里每亩追了两万斤肥，使大部分落后田面貌改观。大樟树生产小队，在算账辩论后的当晚，全队出动除虫，一夜之间，把十多亩禾田的卷叶虫捉个净光。社员还利用休息时间，掀起每人种五十棵蕉运动，三天之内共种了香蕉二万一千多棵。
