Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: The national winter crop sowing has been completed by more than 60%. The wheat sowing work in the main wheat-producing areas of the north has been basically completed. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of the 21st, twenty-two provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, have sown over 404 million mu of various winter crops, completing 64% of this year's autumn and winter sowing plan, and the general quality is better than any previous year.

Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the autumn and winter sowing work. After combating Right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, grasping advanced examples, and establishing pacesetters, the sowing movement in various regions has unfolded magnificently. The vast number of cadres and commune members of the people's communes are full of fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm.

Winter wheat, which accounts for more than half of this year's winter crop sown area, has already been sown on more than 262 million mu, completing 72% of the sowing plan, and the progress is twice as fast as in the same period last year. The North China and Northwest China regions, where the sowing season is relatively early, have basically completed sowing. Sowing in the winter wheat areas of the South has successively entered a high tide.

In the first and middle ten days of October this year, varying degrees of drought occurred in some areas of Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces in the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huai River basins. Under the leadership of the Party, the people in these areas gave full play to the superiority of the people's communes, used the rich experience of drought resistance in the summer of this year, and organized manpower, livestock, and irrigation machinery to carry out drought resistance and seize the time for planting.

While vigorously grasping the winter wheat sowing work, various regions have also done a better job than in previous years in the sowing of winter rapeseed, miscellaneous grains, and green manure crops. At present, over 32 million mu of winter rapeseed have been sown (including seedling area), completing 72% of the sowing plan; over 54 million mu of food grains and miscellaneous grains have been sown, accounting for 42% of the sowing plan; and over 55 million mu of green manure have been sown, accounting for 62% of the sowing plan. This year, many provinces have expanded the planting area of winter rapeseed, and many places have also launched a mass movement to cultivate large "rapeseed king" plants.

The quality of winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed sown this year is higher than in any previous year. In various regions, the wheat land is deeply ploughed, mostly to a depth of six to eight inches, and some reaching more than one foot. Fertilization is applied at about 5,000 jin per mu, and some reaching as high as 10,000 jin. The sowing amount is generally 20 to 30 jin, achieving rational close planting. Various regions are also vigorously developing high-yield plots and garden-style cultivation to drive general fields to strive for higher yields.

Now, the earlier sown wheat and rapeseed have emerged, and generally the seedlings are uniform and strong. People's communes in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other places have launched initial field management activities such as checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, irrigating, and topdressing.

    冬播进度质量胜往年
    二十二个省市已下种四亿多亩，完成计划面积一半多
    据新华社23日讯　全国越冬作物的播种工作已完成了60％以上，北方主要产麦区的种麦工作都已基本完成。据农业部不完全统计，到21日止，河南、山东、河北、安徽、江苏、陕西、湖南、湖北、四川等二十二个省、市、自治区，已经播种各种越冬作物四亿零四百多万亩，完成今年秋冬播种计划面积的64％，而且一般质量比以往任何一年都好。
    在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，各级党委都加强了对秋冬播种工作的领导，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，抓先进，树标兵，各地播种运动已波澜壮阔地展开。各地人民公社广大干部和社员斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。
    占今年越冬作物播种面积一半以上的冬小麦，已经播了两亿六千二百多万亩，完成播种计划面积的72％，进度比去年同期加快了一倍。播种季节比较早的华北地区和西北地区已基本播种完毕。南方冬小麦地区播种已先后进入了高潮。
    今年10月上中旬，长江、黄河、淮河流域的河南、湖北、江苏、安徽、山东、陕西、山西、湖南、江西等省的一部分地区又发生不同程度的旱象，这些地区的人民在党的领导下，发挥人民公社的优越性，运用今年夏季抗旱的丰富经验，组织人力、畜力和排灌机械，进行抗旱抢种。
    各地在大抓越冬小麦播种工作的同时，对越冬油菜、杂粮、绿肥等作物的播种工作也抓得比往年好。目前，冬油菜已播种三千二百多万亩（包括育苗面积），完成播种计划面积的72％；粮杂已播种五千四百多万亩，占播种计划面积的42％；绿肥已播种五千五百多万亩，占播种计划面积的62％。今年不少的省都扩大了冬油菜的种植面积，许多地方还发动群众培植大株“油菜王”运动。
    今年播种的小麦、油菜等越冬作物的质量，比过去任何一年都高。各地播种的小麦地深耕大部在六寸到八寸，部分达到一尺以上，每亩施肥在五千斤左右，高的达到万斤左右，播种量一般在二十斤到三十斤，作到了合理密植。各地还大搞丰产方和园田化，来带动一般田争取更高的产量。
    现在，播种较早的小麦和油菜已经出苗，一般苗齐、苗壮。山西、陕西、河北、山东、河南等地的人民公社已经开展了查苗、补苗、灌溉、追肥等初期的田间管理活动。
    全国越冬作物已完成播种计划面积的百分比：
