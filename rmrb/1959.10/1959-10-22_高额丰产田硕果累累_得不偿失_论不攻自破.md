This year, in Sichuan Province, cadres and the masses have cultivated over 10 million mu of various high-yield demonstration fields. The investment increased only slightly compared to ordinary fields, but the output increased exponentially. High-yield demonstration fields have become pace-setters for the high-speed development of agricultural production, playing an important role in fulfilling and overfulfilling agricultural production plans.

Through cultivating high-yield demonstration fields, the broad masses of cadres have further strengthened their close ties with the masses, improved their leadership style, and enhanced their leadership skills.

News from our newspaper: The various high-yield demonstration fields cultivated by the broad masses of cadres and people in Sichuan Province this year are shining brightly everywhere, with frequent reports of high yields. They have fully demonstrated their "pace-setting" role in the high-speed development of agricultural production, promoting high yields over large areas for various crops.

Under the guidance of the principle of "planting more and harvesting more, combined with high yields over large areas," all regions across the province have not only strived to expand the planting area by making full use of existing land, but have also taken full advantage of the superiority of the communes, cultivating over 10 million mu of high-yield demonstration fields. The more than 600,000 mu of small spring high-yield demonstration fields in the Nanchong Special District achieved an average yield per mu that was approximately double that of ordinary fields. The district also had over 1,000 mu of high-yield wheat command fields, with a per-mu yield exceeding 1,000 jin, more than twice the average yield of ordinary fields. The rice high-yield command fields of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County yielded as high as 1,200 jin per mu, with even the lowest yields increasing by more than 15% compared to the average yield of ordinary fields. In counties such as Dianjiang, Guang'an, Wusheng, and Fengdu, the yield of corn high-yield demonstration fields reached 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu, approximately double the average yield of ordinary fields. Due to the high yield and large increase in production from high-yield demonstration fields, they have played an extremely important role in fulfilling and overfulfilling agricultural production plans. Xichong County cultivated 80,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields this year, accounting for only 38% of the total area, but the output reached 56 million jin, accounting for 63% of the total wheat production. High-yield demonstration fields have become the main force for the county in completing its agricultural production plan.

Since these high-yield demonstration fields mainly rely on improving farming systems and cultivation techniques to achieve high yields, the investment is not much higher than that of ordinary fields, while the income far exceeds that of ordinary fields. According to calculations by the Xingfu Management Area of the Guihu Commune in Xindu County: the average yield per mu of the 316 mu of rapeseed fields in the area was 269 jin, with a net income of more than 31 yuan after deducting investment; the high-yield command fields yielded 501 jin per mu, with a net income of more than 45 yuan per mu after deducting investment, approximately half as much again as ordinary fields. Although the labor used in managing high-yield command fields in various regions is slightly more than that of ordinary fields, the value created per labor day is much higher than that of ordinary fields. The Sihe Management Area of the Shunjiang Commune in Neijiang County cultivated 227 mu of rice high-yield demonstration fields this year, with an average of 24 labor days used per mu, producing 810 jin of rice, with a total value of 68.1 yuan for both primary and secondary products. After deducting the investment of 11.5 yuan, the actual value created per labor day reached 2.36 yuan. Ordinary fields used an average of 19 labor days per mu, producing 559 jin of rice, with a total value of 46.04 yuan for both primary and secondary products. After deducting the investment of 9.56 yuan, the actual income per labor day was 1.92 yuan, 0.44 yuan less than the income per labor day from high-yield demonstration fields. Facts have proven that the right-leaning opportunists' claim that high-yield fields are "unprofitable" is a malicious slander without any basis.

An even more important achievement of cultivating high-yield demonstration fields on a large scale is that they have established a "pace-setter" in the high-speed development of agricultural production, powerfully promoting high yields over large areas, and forcefully shattering the right-leaning opportunists' fallacies that "the experience of high-yield demonstration fields is divorced from reality and cannot be promoted over large areas." The Zhoujia District Committee of Dianjiang County and the Party Committees of the six communes in the district cultivated over 5,000 mu of rice high-yield command fields, with an average yield of 918 jin per mu, an increase of 74% compared to last year. The sowing, management, and harvesting of these command fields were ahead of ordinary fields, and they constantly innovated management methods and cultivation techniques, setting an example for large-scale production in every important yield-increasing link. After the high-yield command fields in the district implemented strip planting and close planting, they motivated the masses to widely promote close planting specifications on a large scale. The high-yield command fields experimented with eating small and frequent meals and applying frequent topdressing with significant results, and the masses immediately learned from this, generally applying topdressing three or more times to the large fields, achieving Grade A seedlings. During harvesting, the high-yield command fields first implemented the spirit of careful harvesting and fine threshing to ensure a bumper harvest, generally adding lids to the threshing drums, reducing scattering by at least 30 jin per mu compared to previous years. This experience was also quickly promoted on a large scale. Therefore, although the district suffered severe drought this year, the more than 73,000 mu of rice in the district still achieved a high yield of 848 jin per mu, an increase of 61% compared to last year.

Through these high-yield demonstration fields and high-yield command fields, the ties between cadres and the masses have been further strengthened, the leadership style has been improved, and the leadership level has been enhanced. This year, more than 10,000 prefectural, county, district, and commune cadres in the Nanchong Special District, through working alongside the masses, were able to promptly understand the various suggestions of the masses for improving current production, quickly discover problems, provide practical guidance to production, and effectively overcome subjectivism. Cheng Zhiyuan, the First Secretary of the Xichong County Party Committee, after studying with the commune members while cultivating command fields, proposed three types of deep plowing based on different conditions such as soil thickness and soil looseness and compaction, greatly promoting the deep plowing work throughout the county. Through cultivating high-yield command fields, the cadres in the county also accumulated a lot of experience in comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," universally strengthening their leadership over production, and in the small spring production, led the people of the county to win a great harvest with an average wheat yield of 452 jin per mu.

Currently, while vehemently refuting the right-leaning opportunists' argument that "cultivating high-yield fields is unprofitable," cadres and the masses in various regions are seizing the time to summarize experiences and actively carry out planning to ensure that in the small spring production of 1960, more and better high-yield demonstration fields and high-yield command fields will be cultivated.

    高额丰产田硕果累累“得不偿失”论不攻自破
    今年，四川省广大干部和群众种植各种作物高额丰产田达一千多万亩，投资比一般田增加不多，而产量却成倍增长。高额丰产田已经成为高速度发展农业生产的标兵，对完成和超额完成农业生产计划，起了重要作用。
    通过种高额丰产田，广大干部进一步加强了和群众的密切联系，改进了领导作风，提高了领导水平。
    本报讯　四川省广大干部和群众今年种植的各种高额丰产田，处处大放光芒，遍传高产捷报，在高速度发展农业生产中充分发挥了“标兵”作用，促进了各种作物大面积高产。
    在多种多收与大面积高产相结合方针的指导下，今年全省各地一面尽力利用现有土地扩大种植面积，一面又充分发挥公社的优越性，种植了高额丰产田达一千多万亩。南充专区的六十多万亩小春高额丰产田，平均亩产比一般田高一倍左右；全区有一千多亩小麦高产指挥田，亩产超过一千斤，较一般田的平均单产高两倍多。郫县红光人民公社的水稻高产指挥田，高的亩产一千二百多斤，低的也较一般田平均产量增产15％以上。垫江、广安、武胜、丰都等县，玉米高额丰产田亩产多达一千五百斤至两千斤，都比一般田的平均产量高一倍左右。由于高额丰产田产量高，增产幅度大，因此对完成和超额完成农业增产计划起了极重要的作用。西充县今年共种小麦高产田八万亩，仅占总面积的38％，而产量达五千六百万斤，占小麦总产量的63％，高额丰产田已成为该县完成农业生产计划的主力。
    由于这些高额丰产田主要依靠改进耕作制度和栽培技术获得高产，投资比一般田增加不多，而收入却大大超过了一般田。据新都县桂湖公社幸福管理区计算：全区三百一十六亩油菜田，平均亩产二百六十九斤，扣除投资后纯收入为三十一元多；高产指挥田亩产五百零一斤，扣除投资后每亩纯收入达四十五元多，约比一般田多一半。各地经营高产指挥田所用的劳动力虽然比一般田多些，但每个劳动日所创造的价值大大高于一般田。内江县顺江公社四合管理区，今年种的二百二十七亩水稻高额丰产田，平均每亩实用劳动日二十四个，产黄谷八百一十斤，正副产品共值六十八点一元，扣除投资十一点五元后，平均每个劳动日创造的实际价值达二点三六元。一般田平均每亩实用劳动日十九个，产黄谷五百五十九斤，正副产品共值四十六点零四元，扣除投资九点五六元，平均每个劳动日实收入一点九二元，比高额丰产田每个劳动日的收入少四角四分。事实证明，右倾机会主义分子说高产田“得不偿失”是毫无根据的恶毒诬蔑。
    大种高额丰产田更为重要的成就是：在高速度发展农业生产方面树立了“标兵”，有力地促进了大面积高产，有力地粉碎了右倾机会主义分子所谓“高额丰产田的经验脱离实际，不能在大面积上推广”的谰言。垫江县周加区委和该区六个公社党委，共种水稻高产指挥田五千多亩，平均亩产九百一十八斤，比去年增产74％。这些指挥田的播种、管理、收获都走在一般田的前面，并且不断革新管理方法和栽培技术，在各个重要增产环节上都为大面积生产树立了榜样。该区高产指挥田贯彻了条栽密植后，带动群众在大面积上普遍推行了密植规格；高产指挥田试行少吃多餐、勤施追肥的效果显著，群众也立即学习，大田一般都做到了追肥三次以上，实现了一类苗化。收割时，高产指挥田首先贯彻精收细打、丰产丰收的精神，拌桶普遍加盖，每亩至少比往年少抛撒三十斤。这一经验也在大面积上迅速得到推广。因此，虽然今年该区受旱严重，但全区的七万三千多亩水稻仍然获得亩产八百四十八斤的高额丰产，比去年增产61％。
    通过这种高额丰产田和高产指挥田，还进一步密切了干部与群众的联系，改进了领导作风，提高了领导水平。今年，南充专区种高产指挥田的一万多名地、县、区、社干部，通过和群众并肩劳动，能够及时了解群众对于搞好当前生产的各种建议，迅速发现问题，切实指导生产，有效地克服了主观主义。西充县委第一书记程志远在种指挥田中，和社员一同研究后，根据土质厚薄、土壤疏松板结等不同情况，提出了三种深耕方式，大大促进了全县的深耕工作。该县干部通过种高产指挥田，对于全面贯彻“八字宪法”也积累了许多经验，普遍加强了对生产的领导，在小春生产中，领导全县人民夺得了平均小麦亩产四百五十二斤的大丰收。
    目前，各地干部群众在痛驳右倾机会主义分子所谓“种高产田得不偿失”的论调的同时，抓紧总结经验，积极进行规划，保证在1960年的小春生产中，把高额丰产田和高产指挥田种得更多更好。
