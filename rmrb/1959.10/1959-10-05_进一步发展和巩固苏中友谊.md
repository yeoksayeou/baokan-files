    Further Develop and Consolidate Soviet-Chinese Friendship
    Deputy Head of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation, Wa. Danilov
    We, the Soviet people, along with the Chinese people, are celebrating the glorious 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    Close and unbreakable friendly relations exist between our two countries and between our two peoples. The great Lenin cultivated this friendship, and he often paid close attention to the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and more than once expressed his warm sympathy for this struggle. The great writers Gorky and Lu Xun pioneered this friendship. And the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era—an era of human liberation—laid a solid foundation for our friendship. Our friendship has been strengthened and grown through the common struggle against common enemies.
    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China began a new stage in our friendship. Soon, in February 1950, our two countries' friendship was legally enshrined through the outstanding document of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    The establishment and activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in China and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in the Soviet Union are a manifestation of the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association was established on October 29, 1957, based on the widespread initiative of all sectors of Soviet society. At the inaugural meeting, prominent social activists, representatives of the glorious working class and collective farmers, well-known scholars, writers, and artists were elected to the association's council. The chairman of the council is A.A. Andreyev, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    The association's charter states: "The task of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is to widely introduce to all sectors of Soviet society the life, history, and culture of the Chinese people, the achievements of socialist construction in the People's Republic of China, and the achievements of the Chinese people in political, economic, and cultural construction, as well as in the struggle for peace. At the same time, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association also helps the Chinese people understand the Soviet Union's communist construction and the life of the Soviet people, as well as the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy."
    Factories, collective farms, scientific institutions, schools, and cultural institutions are group members of the association. Under the council, there are various departments (Propaganda Department, Image Propaganda Department, Foreign Liaison Department, Literary and Art Department). Currently, there are branches of the association in 8 union republics and ten states and border regions of the Russian Federation. Each branch unites dozens of group members. The group members in Moscow City and Moscow Oblast are under the direct leadership of the Central Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association.
    In the two years since its establishment, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association has carried out large-scale work and has gained its due prestige in broad circles of Soviet society.
    The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association commemorates the most important festivals in the history of Sino-Soviet relations and the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. For example, the eighth and ninth anniversaries of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the fortieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement have all been widely commemorated. To commemorate these days, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association has held gatherings with the participation of people from all walks of life in Moscow, Leningrad, the capitals of the union republics, and many other cities in the Soviet Union. Sino-Soviet friendship evenings have also been held in factories, scientific institutions, and schools that are group members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association.
    The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association frequently holds evenings to introduce China's achievements in culture, education, literature, and art. Evenings with the eye-catching name "We Visited China" are particularly popular. At these evenings, Soviet people who have visited China give reports introducing the achievements of China's socialist construction and the talented and hardworking Chinese people.
    Recently, many other interesting forms of work have emerged. For example, the Leningrad Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association often holds question-and-answer evenings about China.
    The Soviet people are willing to learn as much as possible about the achievements, life, and struggles of the Chinese people.
    In response to this desire, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge jointly organize lectures to introduce the history, culture, and art of the Chinese people, and the achievements of China's socialist construction. In many cities, these lectures have changed from occasional events to regular lectures. Such lectures have been organized in Moscow (at the Friendship House of the Peoples, at the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest), Leningrad, and Irkutsk.
    The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association attaches great importance to the work of image propaganda through photo exhibitions to promote Sino-Soviet friendship and the achievements of the Chinese people. Today, in the Soviet Union, it is probably impossible to find a city where there is no photo exhibition or a set of photo exhibitions introducing the achievements of China's socialist construction.
    The Soviet people welcomed their Chinese guests with great love and concern. In the past two years, three delegations from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. Chinese friends have visited many cities in the Soviet Union, visited factories and collective farms, learned about the life of the Soviet people and the experience of communist construction, and introduced the achievements of the Chinese people.
    On the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association's side, two delegations visited the People's Republic of China at the invitation of Chinese friends, learned about the life of the Chinese people and the achievements of China's socialist construction, and in their speeches during their visits, they also introduced the best friend of the Chinese people—the great Soviet Union.
    The exchange of delegations and large groups of travelers promotes the expansion of friendly contacts, helps the exchange of achievements in science, culture, and art in all aspects, and promotes the greater strengthening of the great and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association has launched very great work to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. As early as this summer, lectures introducing the ten-year achievements of the People's Republic of China began in the cultural parks of many cities in our country. Two interesting lectures ("Achievements of Socialist Construction in the People's Republic of China" and "The Cultural Revolution of People's China") have been organized in the Friendship House of the Peoples.
    From September, Sino-Soviet friendship evenings celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China have begun to be held in all cities where there are branches of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association.
    The evening held by the Foreign Liaison Department of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association at the Friendship House of the Peoples on September 22, 1959, was very significant. Those who participated in the evening were Soviet people who had helped the Chinese people at various stages of the Chinese people's struggle. Here were white-haired old men who had served as advisors to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary government, pilots who had defended the Chinese sky from imperialist air robbers, Soviet experts who had helped China restore and develop its national economy, as well as many people who had fought and worked side by side with Chinese friends to consolidate and develop the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship.
    From September 25, evenings began to be held in many of Moscow's largest industrial enterprises and schools. The activities held at the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" factory to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China were very interesting. Representatives of the Chinese Embassy and Chinese travelers came to visit the Moscow metallurgical workers. They were invited to visit the factory, and then a Sino-Soviet friendship evening was held at the factory club.
    On September 28, an exhibition called "Our Friend China" opened at the Moscow Museum of Revolution. The exhibition showcased new and interesting pictures sent by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the original exhibits of the Museum of Revolution.
    At the same time, before October 1 this year, photo exhibitions on "The Tenth Anniversary of the People's Republic of China" were also held in all cities where branches of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association had been established, and sets of photo exhibitions were held in all Soviet cities and many villages.
    On September 30, the Moscow Municipal Committee of the CPSU, the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, jointly with the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, and other social organizations, jointly hosted a celebration meeting for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the Moscow Trade Union Building. Similar celebrations were also held in the capitals of all Soviet union republics, the central cities of states, and many other cities and villages. It can be said that the entire Soviet people celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    All the work of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association is based on the spirit of initiative. The Soviet people harbor deep feelings of love and sympathy for the great Chinese people, so they actively participate in the work of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association.
    The delegation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, headed by N.S. Tikhonov, Vice Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, Soviet poet, and Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, has been paying a friendly visit to the People's Republic of China since September 24.
    The delegation attended the celebration meeting for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China held in Beijing, visited the military parade and parade on October 1, attended the celebration meeting for the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, toured the scenic spots and historical sites in Beijing and its suburbs, and visited the Tianjin Steel Plant. The delegation was warmly received and received friendly care from the staff of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the broad masses of Chinese working people everywhere.
    The delegation will set off for Sichuan Province on October 5, and then will visit Wuhan and Shanghai. The members of the delegation are eager to learn as much as possible about the achievements of China's socialist construction, and at the same time, the members of the delegation are also prepared to introduce the achievements of Soviet communist construction.
    After returning to the Soviet Union, we are prepared to write articles, give lectures and reports, to introduce the life of the Chinese people, to introduce the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to convey the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the Soviet people.
    We fully agree with what N.S. Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet Party and Government delegation, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said: "We are all proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people. We are especially pleased that these achievements have been made under the leadership of the fraternal Chinese Communist Party and under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the great son of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong."
    All the activists of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association will continue to do everything in their power to further consolidate and develop the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship.

    进一步发展和巩固苏中友谊
    苏中友好协会代表团副团长　瓦·达尼洛夫
    我们苏联人同中国人民一道庆祝中华人民共和国光荣的建国十周年，中苏友好协会成立十周年。
    在我们两国之间和两国人民之间，存在着密切的牢不可破的友谊关系。伟大的列宁培植了这种友谊，他经常关切地注意中国人民革命斗争的发展，并且不止一次地表示自己对这个斗争的热烈同情。伟大的作家高尔基和鲁迅开创了这种友谊。而开辟了新纪元——人类解放纪元的伟大的十月社会主义革命，奠定了我们友谊的巩固基础。我们的友谊，通过反对共同敌人的共同斗争而坚固和壮大起来了。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的宣告成立，开始了我们友谊的一个新阶段。不久，在1950年2月，我们两国的友谊又通过苏中友好同盟互助条约这个卓越的文件而在法律上固定下来了。
    中国的中苏友好协会和苏联的苏中友好协会的成立和它们的活动，是牢不可破的苏中友谊的一个表现。
    苏中友好协会是1957年10月29日根据苏联各界广泛倡议而成立的。在成立大会上，选入协会理事会的，有著名的社会活动家，光荣的工人阶级和集体农民的代表，知名的学者和文学家与艺术家。理事会的主席是苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员安·安·安德烈耶夫。
    协会的章程写道：“苏中友好协会的任务是，向苏联各界广泛地介绍中国人民的生活、历史与文化，中华人民共和国的社会主义建设的成就，中国人民在政治、经济和文化建设方面以及在争取和平的斗争中所获得的成就。同时，苏中友协还帮助中国人民了解苏联的共产主义建设和苏联人民的生活以及苏联的和平外交政策。
    各工厂、集体农庄、科学机关、学校和文化机关为协会的团体会员。在理事会下，设有各部（宣传部、形象宣传部、对外联络部、文学艺术部）。目前在8个加盟共和国和俄罗斯联邦的十个州和边区有协会的分会。每个分会联合着几十个团体会员。莫斯科市和莫斯科州的团体会员则在苏中友协中央理事会的直接领导下进行工作。
    苏中友协成立两年来进行了大规模的工作，并在广大的苏联各界获得了它应有的威望。
    苏中友协纪念苏中关系和中国人民革命斗争历史上的最重要的节日。如苏中友好同盟互助条约签订八周年和九周年，中华人民共和国建国九周年，五四运动四十周年等等，都举行了广泛的纪念活动。为纪念这些日子，苏中友协在莫斯科、列宁格勒、各加盟共和国的首都和苏联其他许多城市都举办了各界人士参加的大会，并在作为苏中友协团体会员的工厂、科学机关和学校，举行苏中友好晚会。
    苏中友好协会经常举行晚会，介绍中国在文化、教育、文学和艺术方面的成就。冠以“我们访问了中国”这个引人注意的名称的晚会是特别受人欢迎的。在这种晚会上，由访问过中国的苏联人作报告，介绍中国社会主义建设的成就，介绍天才的勤劳的中国人民。
    最近，又出现了许多其他饶有兴趣的工作形式。例如，列宁格勒苏中友好协会常常举行关于中国的答问晚会。
    苏联人愿意尽可能多地了解中国人民的成就、生活和斗争。
    针对这种愿望，苏中友好协会和全苏政治与科学知识普及协会共同组织讲演会，介绍中国人民的历史、文化和艺术，介绍中国的社会主义建设成就。在许多城市，这种讲演已由偶然举办而转为经常性的讲座。在莫斯科（在各国人民友谊之家，在高尔基中央文化休息公园）、列宁格勒、伊尔库次克都已组织了这种讲座。
    苏中友好协会很重视通过图片展览来宣传苏中友谊和中国人民成就的形象宣传工作。今天，在苏联，大概找不到哪个城市中是没有介绍中国社会主义建设成就的图片展览会或是成套的图片展览了。
    苏联人怀着极大的热爱和关切欢迎了自己的中国客人。两年来，有三个中苏友好协会的代表团，应苏中友好协会的邀请访问了苏联。中国朋友们访问了苏联的许多城市，到过工厂和集体农庄，了解了苏联人民的生活、共产主义建设的经验，介绍了中国人民的成就。
    在苏中友好协会方面，有两个代表团应中国朋友的邀请访问了中华人民共和国，了解了中国人民的生活、中国的社会主义建设成就，并且在访问时的讲话中，也介绍了中国人民最好的朋友——伟大的苏联。
    交换代表团以及成批的旅行者，促进着友好接触的扩大，帮助科学、文化和艺术各个方面成果的交流，促进着伟大的牢不可破的苏中友谊的更大的加强。
    苏中友好协会为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年，展开了非常巨大的工作。早在今年夏天，在我国的许多城市的文化公园中就已开始举行介绍中华人民共和国十年成就的讲演会。在各国人民友谊之家曾经组织了两个饶有兴趣的讲座（“中华人民共和国社会主义建设成就”和“人民中国的文化革命”）。
    从9月中起，在凡有苏中友好协会分会的各个城市中，就已开始举行庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的苏中友谊晚会。
    1959年9月22日，苏中友好协会对外联络部在各国人民友谊之家所举行的晚会是很有意义的。参加晚会的有，在中国人民斗争各个阶段帮助过中国人民的苏联人。这里有担任过孙中山革命政府的顾问的白发老人，有保卫过中国天空免遭帝国主义空中强盗袭击的飞行员，有帮助过中国恢复和发展国民经济的苏联专家，以及曾和中国朋友并肩战斗并肩工作从而巩固和发展了牢不可破的苏中友谊的许多人。
    从9月25日起，在莫斯科的许多最大的工业企业和学校中，开始举行晚会。在莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂举行的庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的活动是很有意思的。中国大使馆的代表和中国的旅行者们来到莫斯科冶金工作者们这里作客。请他们参观了工厂，然后，在工厂俱乐部举行了苏中友谊晚会。
    9月28日，在莫斯科的革命博物馆，名为“我们的朋友中国”的展览会揭幕。展览会展出了中苏友好协会送来的新的有趣的图片和革命博物馆原有的展品。
    同时，今年10月1日以前，在所有已经成立苏中友协分会的城市也都举办了“中华人民共和国十周年”图片展览，苏联所有城市和许多乡村进行了成套图片的展览。
    9月30日，在莫斯科工会大厦，苏共莫斯科市委、苏联对外友好与文化联系协会联合会、苏中友好协会，同全苏工会中央理事会、苏联共青团中央以及其他社会团体，联合主办了中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝大会。在苏联所有加盟共和国的首都、州的中心城市以及其他许多城市和乡村，也举办了同样的庆祝会。可以说，苏联全体人民都庆祝了中华人民共和国成立十周年。
    苏中友好协会的全部工作都是建立在主动精神基础上的。苏联人民对伟大的中国人民怀抱着深厚的爱与同情的感情，因此他们都积极参加苏中友好协会的工作。
    以苏中友好协会理事会副主席、苏联诗人、苏联保卫和平委员会主席尼·谢·吉洪诺夫为首的苏中友好协会代表团自9月24日起在中华人民共和国进行友好访问。
    代表团出席了在北京举行的中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝大会，参观了10月1日的阅兵和游行，出席了庆祝中苏友好协会成立十周年大会，游览了北京市及其郊区的名胜古迹，并参观了天津钢厂。代表团到处都受到了中苏友好协会工作人员以及中国广大的劳动人民的热情接待和友谊的关怀。
    代表团将于10月5日启程去四川省，然后将要访问武汉和上海。代表团的团员们热望尽可能多地了解中国社会主义建设的成就，同时代表团的团员们还准备介绍苏联共产主义建设的成就。
    回到苏联以后，我们准备写文章，作讲演和报告，来介绍中国人民的生活，介绍中国人民在中国共产党和它的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下在社会主义建设中取得的成就，转达中国人民对苏联人民的深厚友谊。
    我们完全同意苏联党政代表团团长、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所讲的话：“中国人民取得的成就，使我们大家都感到骄傲。尤其使我们高兴的是，这些成就是在兄弟的中国共产党的领导下，在以中国人民伟大的儿子毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下取得的。”
    苏中友好协会的全体积极分子将继续尽自己的一切力量，来进一步巩固和发展牢不可破的苏中友谊。
