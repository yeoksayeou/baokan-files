    What Does the British Election Result Show?
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
    The results of the British general election have been preliminarily announced. As of press time, out of the six hundred and thirty seats in the House of Commons, the Conservative Party has won three hundred and twenty-three seats, exceeding half, the Labour Party has won two hundred and twenty-two seats, and the Liberal Party has won five seats. According to reports, many of Labour's traditional seats have been lost to the Conservative Party, and Labour has suffered a major defeat in the general election.
    From the day the election campaign began, the entire process of the election showed that the British people were most concerned about two issues: easing international tensions and eliminating the threat of poverty, unemployment, and inflation, and raising living standards. During its time in power, the Conservative Party did many disgraceful things. Abroad, it launched the Suez War, sent troops to Jordan, armed intervention in the Middle East, and carried out repression in Central Africa... At home, it abolished the Rent Restriction Act, and prices continued to rise (during its five years in power, food prices rose by 50%)... However, one thing was done right: Macmillan visited Moscow this spring; since then, he has repeatedly emphasized the necessity of holding a summit conference. This was a very effective move in attracting voters' attention. Who would attend the summit became a highly inflammatory slogan during the election campaign. In addition, in terms of domestic economic life, the British industrial index has rebounded slightly for several months, gold and dollar reserves have maintained an upward trend, and the huge unemployment figures of last winter and this spring have declined—these objectively benefited the Conservative Party.
    The Conservative Party's continued rule reflects the British people's desire to end the Cold War and ensure a stable life. Affirming this does not negate the British people's dissatisfaction with the Conservative Party's policies, nor does it eliminate the distance or opposition between the British people's wishes and the Conservative Party's policies. Recent facts have eloquently proven this point. For example, two months ago, at the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress, in defiance of the will of the right-wing union leaders, resolutions were passed opposing the establishment of bases in Britain by the United States and opposing the arming of West Germany. During the election campaign, several unions with 3.5 million members put forward demands for wage increases and reduced working hours. These resolutions and actions were directly opposed to the Conservative Party's current policies. In addition, the Conservative Party lost seats in Scotland and Manchester. These two regions have relatively high unemployment rates. This fact reflects the voters' dissatisfaction with the Conservative Party.
    What are the fundamental reasons for the Labour Party's defeat in the election? Labour Party General Secretary Phillips explained that this was because the Labour Party's proposals to increase pensions and reduce purchase taxes would reduce the country's fiscal revenue, and were affected by the Conservative Party's counter-propaganda...
    Obviously, this is not the fundamental issue. The basic reason for Labour's failure lies in the fact that it did not put forward a platform that conformed to the wishes of the British people and had a principled difference from the Conservative Party. In its election platform, the Labour Party abandoned the "nationalization" policy that it had been touting for many years, even though the actual implementation of this policy did not harm the interests of the bourgeoisie or the capitalist system. In terms of reducing unemployment, the Labour Party could not offer any active solutions. The Labour Party remained silent on the demands of the British workers to increase wages and reduce working hours. In foreign policy, the Labour Party did not mention the issue of opposing the rearmament of West Germany, which is of great concern to the broad masses of people. On the one hand, the Labour Party expressed its intention to implement a "quarantine policy" in Europe (which is a positive aspect), but at the same time advocated extending this policy to the "China Sea," that is, creating a "two Chinas" conspiracy. On the one hand, the Labour Party advocated stopping nuclear weapons testing (which is a positive aspect), but at the same time did not oppose the United States' "deterrence policy" and demanded the consolidation of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Therefore, even some newspapers representing the major British monopoly capital groups believed that there was no difference between the policies of the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. For example, the "Banker Magazine" said: Whether in basic principles or in the methods of implementing policies, there is no fundamental difference between the platforms of the two parties. From this, it can be seen that Phillips' explanation is just an old and outdated cover-up. In fact, the Labour Party's pension, tax reduction, and other plans would only reduce government revenue by ten million pounds a year, which is less than 1% of Britain's annual military expenditure, no more than a drop in the bucket. But the Labour Party had no intention of reducing Britain's military expenditure at all. It is no wonder that the broad masses of voters expressed dissatisfaction with the political line of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders.
    The Conservative Party was able to seize Labour's seats partly due to the following factor: in many constituencies, some of Labour's basic masses voted for the Liberal Party's candidates, thereby dispersing the votes and helping the Conservative Party.
    The Labour Party's failure is also a failure of the social-democratic reformist ideology in Britain. Some people believe that the result of this election will further promote the division within the Labour Party, and this view is not without reason.

### 英国大选结果说明了什么？

    英国大选结果说明了什么？
    本报记者　潘非
    英国大选的结果已初步揭晓。截至发稿时止，在下院六百三十个席位中，保守党已获得三百二十三席，超过了半数，工党获得二百二十二席；自由党获得五席。据报道，工党的许多传统席已丧失给保守党，工党在大选中遭到了重大的失败。
    从竞选运动开始的那天起，大选的整个过程表明：英国广大人民最关心的是两个问题：缓和国际紧张局势；消除贫困、失业和通货膨胀的威胁，提高生活水平。保守党在执政期间，做了许多并不光彩的事情。在国外，它发动了苏伊士战争，进兵约旦，武装干涉中东，以及在中非进行镇压……。在国内，它取消了限制房租法案，物价不断上涨（在它执政的五年中，食品价格上涨了50％）……。但是，有一件事情是做对了：麦克米伦在今春访问了莫斯科；自此以后，他再三地强调召开政府首脑会议的必要。这是很能吸取选民的注意力的一着。谁去出席政府首脑会议，成为竞选期间带有极大煽动性的口号。另外，在国内经济生活方面，英国工业指数几个月来都稍有回升，黄金美元储备保持着上升的趋势，去冬今春庞大的失业数字已呈下降——这些，在客观上都对保守党有利。
    保守党的继续执政，反映了英国人民要求结束冷战和保障生活安定的愿望。肯定这一点，并不能抹煞英国人民对于保守党政策的不满，并不能消除英国人民的愿望和保守党政策之间的距离或对立。最近所发生的事实，雄辩地证明了这一点。例如，两个月前，在职工大会的年会上，违反工会右翼领袖的意志，通过了反对美国在英国设立基地、反对武装西德的决议。就在竞选期间，拥有三百五十万会员的几个工会，提出了增加工资、减少工时的要求。这些决议和行动，都是和保守党的现行政策针锋相对的。此外，保守党在苏格兰和曼彻斯特的席位，都有减少。这两个地区，都是失业指数比较高的。这一事实，反映了选民对保守党的不满。
    工党在大选中遭到失败的基本原因是什么呢？工党总书记菲利普斯解释说：这是因为工党提出的有关增加养老金、减低购买税等方案，将减少国家的财政收入，在这一点上受到保守党反宣传的影响……。
    显然，这不是问题的根本所在。工党失败的基本原因在于：它没有提出一个符合英国人民愿望，同保守党有原则区别的政纲。在竞选纲领中，工党放弃了多年来一直标榜的“国有化”政策，尽管这一政策的实际执行无损于资产阶级的利益和资本主义制度。在减少失业方面，工党提不出积极的方案。对于英国广大工人提高工资、减少工时的要求，工党采取缄默态度。在对外政策上，工党对于反对西德重新武装这一为广大人民十分关心的问题，只字未提。工党一方面表示要在欧洲实行“隔离政策”（这是有积极意义的一面），但同时又主张把这一政策推行到“中国海”，即制造“两个中国”的阴谋。工党一方面主张停止核武器试验（这是有积极意义的一面），但同时又不反对美国的“威慑政策”，要求巩固北大西洋侵略集团。因此，连代表英国大垄断资本集团的一些报刊，也认为工党和保守党的政策没有区别。例如“银行家杂志”说：不论在基本原则上，不论在执行政策的方法上，两党的纲领都没有根本差别。由此可见，菲利普斯的解释只是一种旧得不能再旧的掩饰。事实上，工党的养老金、减税等等方案，每年只减少政府收入一千万英镑，这还不到英国每年军事费用的1％，无异九牛一毛。但工党却没有减低英国军事费用的任何打算。这就难怪广大选民，对工党的右翼领袖的政治路线表示不满。
    保守党所以能够夺取工党的席位，部分地由于这样一个因素：在不少选区内，工党的一些基本群众，把选票投给了自由党的候选人，从而分散了选票，帮助了保守党。
    工党的失败，也是社会民主主义的改良主义思想在英国的失败。有人认为，这次大选的结果，将进一步推动工党内部的分化，这种看法不是没有道理的。
