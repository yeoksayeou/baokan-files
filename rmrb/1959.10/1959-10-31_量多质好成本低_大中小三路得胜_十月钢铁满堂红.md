Xinhua News Agency, 30th - October has been an unprecedentedly high and fruitful month for steel production. According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the national steel production plan for October was overfulfilled two days ahead of schedule on the 29th, and the production plans for pig iron and steel products were also overfulfilled one day ahead of schedule on the 30th.

The most prominent feature of national steel production in October is that it has created a new situation of overall great leap forward. Whether in terms of output, quality, or cost, or in terms of large enterprises or small and medium-sized enterprises, there are reports of production triumphs everywhere.

In terms of output, the output of steel, iron, and steel products from the 1st to the 30th increased by 14%, 13%, and 15% respectively compared with September, and in these thirty days, each ten-day period was higher than the previous one. In key iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan, Benxi, Taiyuan, and Chongqing, the utilization coefficient of eight large and medium-sized blast furnaces has reached above 2, and the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in ten provinces including Jiangsu has reached 0.9 to 1.74. These advanced indicators were only achievable by a few large and medium-sized blast furnaces and a few provincial small blast furnaces a little over a month ago. In terms of quality, the qualified rate of pig iron in seven provinces has reached over 90%, and the qualified rate of pig iron in thirteen provinces has reached over 80%, which is a big step forward compared with September; the qualified rate of converter steel in key enterprises generally reached over 93%. In terms of cost, the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces and the cost of converter steel across the country have been greatly reduced.

The vast number of steel workers across the country, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, have launched a surging production upsurge. This is the fundamental reason for the unprecedented high steel production in October. The convening of the National "Heroes Conference" has further stimulated the production enthusiasm of steel workers and promoted the production upsurge to surge forward wave after wave. In the steel capital of Anshan, the joint technical performance competition launched by hundreds of thousands of steel workers has been valued by steel workers across the country. During the joint technical performance competition week held from the 15th to the 21st, they overcame more than 5,000 key production problems, promoted more than 4,000 advanced experiences, and created more than 24,000 new production records. In just these seven days, the average daily steel output of Anshan Iron and Steel was increased by 12% compared with September, the iron output was increased by 15%, and the steel output was increased by 17%. From the 26th, they launched the second joint technical performance competition week, and new production triumphs are constantly coming from Anshan. In Shanghai, hundreds of thousands of steel workers launched a mass record-breaking movement, coupled with the vigorous iron support from various provinces, steel production also leaped forward.

November is the key month to complete the steel production plan for this year ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has instructed metallurgical enterprises in various places to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, vigorously carry out mass movements, prevent complacency, and continue to improve output and quality conscientiously, save coking coal and pig iron, do a good job in safety production and financial cost work, better realize the overall leap forward, and at the same time prepare for next year's production.

    量多质好成本低　大中小三路得胜
    十月钢铁满堂红
    同九月比钢增长14％
    铁增长13％
    钢材增长15％
    新华社30日讯　10月份是钢铁生产空前高涨的一个丰收月。据冶金工业部统计，10月份全国钢的生产计划已经提前两天在29日超额完成，生铁和钢材的生产计划，也已经提前一天在30日超额完成。
    10月份全国钢铁生产最突出的特点是，开创了全面跃进的崭新局面。不论是产量或是质量、成本，也不论是大型企业或是中小型企业，到处都是生产捷音频传。
    在产量方面，1日到30日钢、铁、钢材的产量比9月份分别增加了14％、13％和15％，而在这三十天中，也是一旬比一旬高。在鞍山、本溪、太原、重庆等重点钢铁企业，已经有八座大中型高炉的利用系数达到二以上，江苏等十个省的小高炉，利用系数达到了零点九到一点七四。这些先进的指标，在一个多月以前，还只有少数大中型高炉和少数省的小高炉能够达到。在质量方面，已经有七个省的生铁合格率达到了90％以上，十三个省的生铁合格率达到了80％以上，比9月份又跨进了一大步；各重点企业转炉钢的合格率，一般地都达到了93％以上。在成本方面，目前全国小高炉生铁的成本及转炉钢的成本，都降低很多。
    全国广大钢铁职工，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起了汹涌澎湃的生产高潮，这是10月份钢铁生产空前高涨的根本原因。全国“群英会”的召开，更加激发了钢铁工人的生产热情，推动了生产高潮一浪高过一浪，不断滚滚向前。在钢都鞍山，十几万钢铁工人展开的联合技术表演赛，为全国钢铁工人所重视。他们在15日到21日举行的联合技术表演竞赛周，一共攻克了五千多个生产关键，推行了四千多项先进经验，创造了二万四千多次生产新纪录。仅仅在这七天内，就把鞍钢每天的平均钢产量，比9月份提高了12％，铁产量提高了15％，钢材产量提高了17％。从26日开始，他们又展开了第二个联合技术表演竞赛周，新的生产捷报正从鞍山不断传出。在上海，十万钢铁工人展开了群众性的创纪录运动，加以各省大力运铁支援，钢的生产也飞跃前进。
    11月是提前和超额完成今年钢铁生产计划的关键月，冶金工业部已经指示各地冶金企业要继续反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，防止麻痹自满，要兢兢业业地继续提高产量、质量，节约焦煤、生铁，作好安全生产和财务成本工作，更好地实现全面跃进，同时作好明年的生产准备工作。（附图片）
