　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: Cotton purchasing, processing, and transportation are advancing simultaneously in Jiangsu Province, one of China's key cotton-producing areas. After overfulfilling the September target, from October 1st to 8th, the province's average daily cotton purchase volume increased by 150% compared to the previous month, the average daily ginned cotton processing volume increased by over 50%, and the new cotton transported to textile mills equaled the total transportation volume for the entire month of September. In the past month or so, the purchase, processing, and transportation volumes of new cotton have all increased exponentially compared to the same period last year.

　　The momentum, speed, and quality of this year's cotton purchasing campaign in Jiangsu Province are unprecedented in history.

　　Party committees at all levels have further emphasized early, tight, and effective management of cotton purchasing this year. Counties, cities, and communes have established cotton purchasing headquarters or offices, led by the Party Secretary, to strengthen specific leadership, fully mobilize the masses, organize specialized teams, and launch concentrated efforts, creating a high tide of cotton picking and selling. In Nantong Prefecture, a famous cotton-producing area, county Party committees recently held consecutive cadre meetings, telephone conferences, and broadcast meetings, repeatedly explaining the important significance of urgently picking and selling cotton to cadres and the masses. At the same time, they established special leadership lines for cotton, unified labor arrangements, and established 27,000 specialized teams for picking, drying, and selling cotton throughout the prefecture, with 1.2 million laborers participating in the urgent cotton picking and selling campaign. Currently, there are 2 million laborers in the province picking and selling cotton, and the sales volume is increasing daily. Thirty thousand purchasing personnel are at the forefront of cotton purchasing across the province. All powered cotton ginning mills in the province are also processing ginned cotton day and night. Communes throughout the region have formed professional and sideline transportation teams to send seed cotton to purchasing stations and processing plants, and then transport ginned cotton from the processing plants to the main lines, facilitating transportation to the cities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th: The cotton and tobacco purchasing campaign in Shandong Province has a huge momentum, and the picking, harvesting, and transportation work is advancing steadily. By the end of September, the amount of ginned cotton purchased throughout the province had exceeded the purchase amount for the same period in any previous year, exceeding the original purchase target for the third quarter by about 150%. The purchase situation of flue-cured tobacco is also very good, with the purchase volume increasing by 14% compared to the same period last year. Now, large quantities of new cotton are being continuously transferred to textile industrial cities in and outside the province, such as Shanghai and Qingdao. The task of supplying cotton wadding to Jilin Province in October began to be shipped in mid-September. Entering October, the transportation work became even busier. On the 7th, a single transfer station in Pingyuan County transported more than 2,700 dan (approximately 135,000 kg) of new cotton.

　　The cotton purchased in Shandong this year is of good quality, the warehousing procedures are clear, the figures are accurate, and all tasks are carried out both vigorously and realistically. Farmers in cotton-producing areas have universally launched a patriotic competition campaign of "seeing who picks the fastest, harvests the cleanest, has the highest grade, and sells the most." Many areas have launched a competition upsurge between communes, teams, groups, and commune members to compare work efficiency, strive for advancement, create miracles, and compare sales.

　　Due to the rapid and timely cotton picking this year, the quality of cotton has significantly improved, generally increasing by one to two grades compared to last year.

　　In order to facilitate the sale of new cotton, commercial departments in various regions have vigorously improved purchasing methods. Many regions have increased the number of purchasing points, and there are commanders in the cotton collection yards responsible for arranging order, ensuring that everything is managed by someone, and that livestock and vehicles are arranged. Reception rooms, service desks, canteens, drinking water tanks, washbasins, supervision stations, and opinion books have also been set up in the cotton collection yards, and propagandists are equipped to provide cordial and enthusiastic services to cotton farmers, which the masses are very satisfied with.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: Farmers in cotton-producing areas in Hubei are enthusiastically selling new cotton. As of October 5th, the amount of new cotton in storage throughout the province increased by 47.7% compared to the same period last year. The quality of the cotton sold by farmers is very good, and the grade is generally one grade higher than last year.

　　Although the 8 million mu (approximately 533,333 hectares) of cotton in the province suffered from relatively severe drought and pests this year, under the strong leadership of the Party, the cotton-producing farmers launched a vigorous and arduous drought resistance struggle, ensuring the normal growth of cotton.

　　The cotton-producing farmers deeply realized that this year's bumper harvest was brought about by the people's commune system and was the result of the Party's wise leadership. They are actively supporting national construction with practical actions of "selling cotton quickly, selling more cotton, and selling good cotton."

　　公社售棉花  速度空前快
    苏、鲁、鄂收购的皮棉超过历史上同期最高数量
    据新华社南京12日电　我国棉花重点产区之一的江苏省，棉花收购、加工、调运各项工作齐头并进。继超额完成9月份任务之后，10月1日到8日，全省平均每天棉花收购量又比上月增长一倍半，平均每天皮棉加工量增长50％以上，调运到纺织厂的新棉等于9月全月调运量的总和。一个多月来，新棉收购、加工、调运量和去年同期相比，都有了成倍增长。
    今年江苏省棉花采购战线上声势之大，速度之快，质量之好，都是历史上没有过的。
    各级党委今年对棉花收购工作都进一步抓早、抓紧、抓好。各县市和公社都建立了棉花收购指挥部或办公室，由党委书记挂帅，加强具体领导，全面发动群众，组织专业队伍，分头突击，掀起收摘、出售棉花的高潮。著名棉花产地南通专区，各县县委最近先后连续召开干部会、电话会、广播会，向干部和群众反复说明突击拾棉、售棉的重要意义，同时建立棉花专线领导，统一安排劳力，全专区共建立二万七千个拾花、晒花、售花专业队，有一百二十万劳动大军投入了突击拾棉、售棉运动。目前全省共有二百万劳力在拾棉、售棉，售棉量逐日增加。全省三万名收购大军正在采购前线收棉。全省所有动力轧花厂，也在夜以继日地加工皮棉。各地公社组成专业和副业运输队，把籽棉送到采购站和加工厂，又从加工厂把皮棉运到干线，便于转运到城市。
    据新华社济南12日电　山东省棉、烟采购运动声势浩大，摘收和调运工作节节推进。到9月底止，全省收购的皮棉已经超过了历史上任何一年同期的收购量，比原订的第三季的收购任务超出了约一倍半；烤烟的收购情况也很好，收购量比去年同期增长14％。现在大批新棉正源源调往上海、青岛等省内外纺织工业城市。10月份支援吉林省的絮棉任务，9月中旬就开始启运了。进入10月份，调运工作更加繁忙，7日一天仅平原县一个中转站就运出新棉二千七百多担。
    今年山东收购的棉花，质量好，入库手续清楚，数字准确，各项工作进行得既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实。产棉区农民普遍开展了“看谁拾得快、摘得净、品级高、交售多”的爱国主义竞赛运动。许多地区掀起了公社与公社，队与队，组与组，社员与社员之间的比工效、争上游，创奇迹、比交售的竞赛高潮。
    由于今年棉花摘拾得迅速及时，使棉花质量有了显著提高，一般都比去年提高一级到两级。
    为了便利出售新棉，各地商业部门大力改进了收购方法。许多地区增设了收购点，在收棉场设有指挥员，负责安排秩序，做到事事有人管，畜、车有安排。在收棉场还设立有招待室、服务台、小卖部、饮水缸、洗脸盆、监督台、意见簿等，配备了宣传员，亲切热情地为棉农服务，群众感到非常满意。
    据新华社武汉12日电　湖北各产棉区农民踊跃出售新棉。到10月5日止，全省入库的新棉比去年同期增长47.7％。农民交售的棉花质量很好，品级一般比去年提高一级。
    今年全省八百万亩棉花虽然受到比较严重的旱灾和虫害，但是在党的坚强领导下，棉区农民展开了轰轰烈烈的艰苦的抗旱斗争，保证了棉花的正常生长。
    棉区农民们深刻体会到今年的丰收是人民公社化以后给他们带来的好处，是党英明领导的结果，纷纷以“快卖棉、多卖棉、卖好棉”的实际行动，支援国家建设。
