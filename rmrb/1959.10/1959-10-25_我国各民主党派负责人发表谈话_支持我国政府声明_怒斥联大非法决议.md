Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued the following statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's discussion and adoption of the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution:

Under the planning and coercion of the United States, the United Nations has openly discussed and adopted the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution. We feel immense anger and express strong protest against this crime of the U.S. imperialism of brazenly interfering in our internal affairs and intensifying international tensions.

The U.S. imperialists, using the name of the United Nations to slander our country and provoke the 650 million Chinese people, have once again exposed their ugly face of adhering to the Cold War and persisting in aggression before the people of the world, demonstrating that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The U.S. imperialists vainly attempt to weaken our country's growing international prestige by this means, but the result will inevitably only make themselves more isolated in the world. We believe that the peace-loving people of the world will further recognize the hideous face of U.S. imperialism from this farce staged by the United Nations, strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and defend peace, and resolutely smash its conspiracy to intensify international tensions.

Tibet is Chinese territory. Quelling the rebellion and implementing democratic reforms are entirely our internal affairs, and no country or international organization has the right to interfere. The United Nations resolution is completely illegal and invalid. This illegal resolution cannot damage the great People's Republic of China in the slightest, but only adds another shameful record to the history of the United Nations. The statement issued by our government severely condemns the crimes of U.S. imperialism and fully expresses the will and determination of our people. We express our complete support. Our only response to U.S. imperialism is to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, fully support the democratic reforms of our Tibetan compatriots, strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and completely smash all U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracies. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the Chinese people of all nationalities under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said:
	
	U.S. Imperialist Slander and Provocation Will Achieve Nothing
	
Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued the following statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution:

Recently, U.S. imperialism, at the instigation of its servant countries, coerced the United Nations organization, directing some servant countries to raise the so-called "Tibet issue," grossly interfering in our internal affairs. The Chinese people express extraordinary indignation at this. Yesterday, our government issued a solemn statement, strongly refuting it, reflecting the will and demands of our people. This is entirely correct. I and all members of the China Democratic League fully agree with and support this statement.

Tibet is an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The suppression of the rebellion in Tibet and the democratic reforms carried out by the Tibetan people are entirely internal matters of our country, and the Chinese people will never allow any foreign interference. U.S. imperialism, utilizing its servant countries, actually raised the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations, and manipulated the United Nations voting machine, distorting facts, reversing right and wrong, and passing illegal resolutions. This is something that the Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize and is unanimously opposed by all peace-loving, justice-upholding, and fairness-advocating people throughout the world.

Our government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is to eliminate the extremely barbaric, reactionary, and dark serf system in Tibet, liberating millions of Tibetan compatriots from this system and allowing them to begin living a happy life of democracy, equality, and freedom like other ethnic groups in our country. This great victory of the Tibetan revolution is a major event in our history and is sympathized with and supported by peace-loving and progressive people all over the world. U.S. imperialism's reversal of right and wrong, provocation, and slander will achieve nothing and will only expose it as the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. This action of U.S. imperialism is intended to intensify the Cold War and hinder the relaxation of the international situation. Therefore, not only the Chinese people resolutely oppose it, but all people throughout the world who are concerned about peace will express extreme indignation.

    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction, said:

    Our Internal Affairs Allow No Interference from Any Country or International Organization

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction, issued the following statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution:

Recently, the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, discussed and adopted the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution, which makes us feel extremely indignant. All members of our All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose this illegal resolution of the United Nations and strongly protest the despicable actions of U.S. imperialism in coercing the United Nations to interfere in our internal affairs.

Tibet is the territory of our country. Just as no one can change history, this is an ironclad fact that no one can deny. Within our own territory, suppressing rebellion and implementing democratic reforms, enabling the vast majority of the Tibetan people to be liberated from the dark, cruel, and backward serf system, is entirely our internal affair, and no country or international organization has the right to interfere. In order to intensify the Cold War, U.S. imperialism, disregarding the opposition of peace-loving people and progressives all over the world, colluded with a small handful of rebellious elements in Tibet, manipulated its voting machine in the United Nations to pass absurd and shameless resolutions. This is something the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The intention behind U.S. imperialism's engagement in such a conspiratorial farce is to re-intensify the currently easing international situation in order to achieve the aims of those warmongers in expanding armaments and preparing for war and seizing huge military profits. This is not only intentionally making itself an enemy of the Chinese people but also frantically making itself an enemy of peace-loving people all over the world.

We want to warn U.S. imperialism and its followers: The Tibetan people have stood up, no longer willing to be slaves. They want to live human lives. They are personally destroying the man-eating serf system and establishing a democratic, socialist new Tibet. That small handful of rebellious elements are just some useless dregs. No matter how they collude with U.S. imperialism, they cannot hinder the advance of the Tibetan people in the slightest. To be honest, even if U.S. imperialism starts its voting machine in the United Nations to pass a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand resolutions slandering China, it will not harm us Chinese people who have stood up, the Chinese people who are on the side of justice, by even a hair. On the contrary, it will only make people all over the world see more clearly the hideous face and bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism! Awaiting U.S. imperialism is only another shameful failure!

    Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said:

    The United States Attempts to Make the Easing International Situation Tense Again

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued the following statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution:

We, the national industrialists and businessmen, together with the people of the whole country, feel immense indignation at the U.S. imperialism coercing the United Nations to pass the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution. We express firm support for our government's statement regarding the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations on the so-called "Tibet issue."

U.S. imperialism openly violates the United Nations Charter and grossly interferes in our internal affairs. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. Tibet is the sacred territory of our country. Suppressing the rebellion of a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet is entirely our internal affair, and U.S. imperialism is absolutely not allowed to spread rumors and slander and interfere. Our government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet and its implementation of democratic reforms, liberating millions of Tibetan compatriots from the cruel enslavement of the serf system and gradually leading them onto the bright path of socialism, is the urgent demand of the Tibetan people and the firm will of the people of the whole country. The lies of U.S. imperialism, such as so-called maintenance of the "basic human rights" of the Tibetan people and so-called "sympathy for the Tibetan people," are attempts to preserve the dark, reactionary serf system in Tibet and to re-intensify the easing international situation. This once again exposes U.S. imperialism as the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are more united than ever, advancing on the socialist road, and will further unite with the people of the world to thoroughly smash the shameless conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and resolutely struggle to ease international tensions and defend lasting world peace.

    Wang Shaoyu, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said:

    The United States' Base Tricks Expose Its Own Ugly Face

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Wang Shaoyu, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, issued the following statement regarding the United States' coercion of the United Nations to pass the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution and its interference in our internal affairs:

Recently, under the planning and manipulation of the United States, the United Nations actually discussed and passed the so-called "Tibet issue" illegal resolution at its General Assembly meeting. This is an illegal action that grossly interferes in our internal affairs, seriously violates the United Nations Charter, and endangers international peace and security. The Chinese people express extraordinary indignation and resolute opposition to this.

The armed rebellion launched by a small number of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet in March of this year has already been quickly suppressed. Under the leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Tibet region is carrying out democratic reforms in a step-by-step manner with the enthusiastic demands and efforts of the vast majority of monks and laypeople, and has already achieved great successes. More than one million serfs who had no personal freedom have been liberated from the dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system and have embarked on the bright and free road from the abyss of suffering. The vast majority of monks and laypeople in Tibet are joyfully and enthusiastically advancing for their own happy future. This is already a fact that everyone has witnessed. The U.S. government is using the banner of so-called "respect for the basic human rights of the Tibetan people" to reverse right and wrong and confuse black and white. This is completely a malicious slander against great China. This base trick is only enough to expose its own imperialist ugly face before the people of the world. It cannot have the slightest impact on the liberation and progress of the people in the Tibet region of our country.

It must be pointed out that this sinful activity of the U.S. government is another frenzied manifestation of its intensification of international tensions and adherence to its policy of aggression. Today, with the unprecedented strength of the peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union, the unprecedentedly strong aspirations of peace-loving people throughout the world, and the unprecedented unity of the 650 million people of all nationalities in China, the tricks of U.S. imperialism will in no way succeed.

All members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy firmly support our government's statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and are determined to work with the people of the whole country to smash the aggressive conspiracy activities of U.S. imperialism with all our strength.

    Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said:

    Any Interference Conspiracy of International Reactionaries Is Doomed to Failure

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, issued the following statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly:

Recently, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly illegally discussed the so-called "Tibet issue" and passed a resolution slandering the People's Republic of China. This is another sinful act by the international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism, grossly interfering in our internal affairs, trampling on the United Nations Charter, and deliberately intensifying international tensions. All members of our Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, like the people of the whole country, feel great indignation at this, express strong protest, and fully support our government's statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Tibet is a part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. Our people's suppression of the rebellion of a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet and the implementation of democratic reforms in the Tibet region are purely internal affairs of our country, and no foreign country or international organization has the right to interfere. This time, U.S. imperialism coerced some countries to openly create the so-called "Tibet issue" at the United Nations General Assembly and pass a so-called "Tibet issue" resolution, which is completely illegal and invalid. This sinful act of grossly interfering in our internal affairs once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of our people. The people of the whole world have also seen once again that, in order to resist the easing of the international situation, the U.S. imperialists are making every effort to continue to incite and intensify the "Cold War." This approach, which endangers world peace and makes itself an enemy of the Chinese people, has aroused greater hatred and opposition from our people towards imperialism.

Any slander or conspiracy of interference by the international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism cannot change the inevitable course of historical development in Tibet and the fact that Tibet belongs to China in the slightest, nor can it stop the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, from advancing along the happy road of socialism. It can be affirmed that, just like the previous aggressions and interferences of U.S. imperialism against our country, this conspiracy will inevitably suffer a shameful failure, while the Tibetan people of our country are thoroughly shaking off the shackles of the backward, dark, and cruel serfdom and moving towards the bright road of happiness and freedom.

    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Zhi Gong Party, said:

    The Chinese People Are Not Afraid of Any Slander or Threats

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Zhi Gong Party, issued the following statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly:

Tibet has been the territory of our country for thousands of years. Our Central People's Government's suppression of the armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet and the implementation of democratic reforms are entirely internal affairs of our country, and no country or international organization has the right to interfere. This is a very clear thing. However, the warmongering group in the United States, in order to intensify the international "Cold War" and prevent the international tension from easing, recently disregarded the firm opposition of the Soviet Union and socialist countries and the dissatisfaction of other peace-loving countries, and disregarded the principle clearly stipulated in the United Nations Charter that it should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, coerced its servant countries Ireland and Malaya to come forward and raise the so-called "Tibet issue" for discussion in the United Nations, and passed the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" under the manipulation of the United States. This is an extremely absurd and sinful act. Every Chinese person feels great indignation and immense hatred towards this crime of U.S. imperialism in antagonizing our people and interfering in our internal affairs.

The U.S. imperialists say that the basic human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people have been forcibly deprived. This is truly the utmost in rumor-mongering and slander. The fact is that the Tibetan people have lived inhuman lives under the serf system for thousands of years. Their basic human rights have been completely deprived by the ruling class, and there is no freedom of religious belief at all. Only after our government implemented the suppression of rebellious elements and quelled the rebellion, and implemented democratic reforms, did the Tibetan people gain basic human rights and gain true freedom of religious belief. As everyone knows, the imperialist camp headed by the United States is truly carrying out colonialism throughout the world, encouraging racial discrimination, exploiting and slaughtering colonial people, and invading and violating the basic human rights and culture of colonial people. May I ask what qualifications U.S. imperialists have to talk about safeguarding basic human rights? It is truly the utmost in shamelessness.

We fully support the statement issued by our government on October 23, 1959, regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" discussed and passed by the United Nations General Assembly. All members of our party are extremely indignant at the slander of U.S. imperialism and strongly condemn it, and pledge to fully support all foreign policies of our government. We express our deep regret that the United Nations, which is controlled by the United States, has once again taken extremely unfriendly and extremely dishonorable actions against the Chinese people, thus lowering its own prestige. We also want to solemnly tell the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices that the 650 million people of the People's Republic of China are not afraid of any slander or threats. Your any attempt to interfere in our internal affairs will, like all previous conspiracies, end in a shameful failure. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that the illegal resolution adds a stain to the history of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, issued the following statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly:

U.S. imperialism, in order to deliberately intensify international tensions, undermine international peace, and manipulate and coerce the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss and pass the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue," our government issued a solemn statement expressing strong protest. All members of our Jiusan Society feel great indignation at the sinful act of U.S. imperialism, flying the banner of the United Nations, grossly interfering in China's internal affairs, and creating tension in the Far East. We express our firm support for our government's statement.

The resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States is completely illegal and invalid. Tibet is the territory of our country. Suppressing the rebellion and implementing democratic reforms are entirely internal affairs of our country, and the United Nations and any foreign country have no right to interfere. U.S. imperialism wants to incite opposition to China on this issue, which is purely China's internal affair. This just shows that it is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. It still clings to the aggressive policy of hostility towards China. It can only further arouse the hatred and opposition of the Chinese people towards U.S. imperialism. It cannot change the inevitable course of historical development in Tibet or the strong will of the Tibetan people to demand democratic reforms, nor can it affect the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country, including the Tibetan people, in the slightest.

The United Nations Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The United States coerced the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution interfering in China's internal affairs, directly violating this clear provision of the United Nations Charter. This matter adds a stain to the history of the United Nations and once again exposes the sinful act of the United States in using the United Nations to create tension.

In order to incite some countries to be hostile to China and poison the international atmosphere, U.S. imperialism chanted the so-called "humanitarian principles" in the passed illegal resolution. This just shows that the so-called "humanitarianism" of U.S. imperialism is to maintain the serf system of skinning people and gouging out their eyes. The "humanitarianism" in the mouth of U.S. imperialism is the enslavement and torture of people. The enslavement and torture suffered by the Tibetan people is praised by U.S. imperialism as a beautiful system. Tibet is undergoing democratic reforms to abolish enslavement and torture, but U.S. imperialism is hindering it under the banner of "humanitarianism." This just shows that U.S. imperialism is an enemy of humanitarianism and human rights. We want to solemnly tell the U.S. imperialists: Your clamoring is futile. The democratic reforms in Tibet cannot be hindered by anyone.

    Responsible Person of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said:

    Once Again Proves That U.S. Imperialism Is the Sworn Enemy of the Chinese People of All Nationalities

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. The responsible person of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued the following statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly:

Our government's statement regarding the illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibet issue" passed by the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly expresses the solemn position and great indignation of the entire Chinese people. All members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League fully support this statement and express strong protest against the sinful actions of U.S. imperialism in being hostile to the Chinese people.

Tibet is a part of China's sacred territory. No foreign country or any international organization has the right to interfere in China's internal affairs. The so-called "Tibet issue" proposal passed by U.S. imperialism through the United Nations is a fundamental violation of the United Nations Charter and an intolerable act of interference in China's internal affairs. It is illegal and invalid. This is another provocation against the Chinese people by U.S. imperialists flying the flag of the United Nations. This matter undeniably shows that U.S. imperialism, regardless of the universal desire of the people of the world to eliminate the "Cold War," continues to adhere to the "Cold War" policy, using the United Nations as a tool of the "Cold War," deliberately creating tension, and trying to hinder the easing of the international situation.

This sinful act of U.S. imperialism once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people of all nationalities, especially the Tibetan people, in their true freedom and liberation. For ten years, U.S. imperialism has never stopped its aggression and interference against China. U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory Taiwan with armed force, actively engaged in conspiracies to create "two Chinas," and even attempted to threaten with some kind of "all-out war" to hinder our people's sacred cause of liberating their own territory Taiwan. But the conspiracies of the United States can only further arouse the righteous indignation of the Chinese people against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference. There is no doubt that this conspiracy of the United States is doomed to failure. Despite the rumors, slander, interference, and aggression of U.S. imperialism, the great Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, will certainly be able to advance on the happy road of socialism! Taiwan will surely be liberated! The struggle of the people of all countries in the world to continue to ease international tensions will surely be victorious.

    我国各民主党派负责人发表谈话
    支持我国政府声明　怒斥联大非法决议
    民革负责人说联大非法决议丝毫不能损害中华人民共和国
    新华社24日讯　中国国民党革命委员会负责人就联合国大会讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    联合国在美国策划和挟持之下，公然讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议；我们对美帝国主义这种蛮横干涉我国内政和加剧国际紧张局势的罪行，感到无比的愤怒，表示强烈的抗议。
    美帝国主义者盗用联合国的名义来诬蔑我国，向六万万五千万中国人民进行挑衅，这就在全世界人民的面前再一次暴露了它的坚持冷战、坚持侵略的丑恶面目，说明美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义者妄图以此来削弱我国在国际上日益增长的威望，而结果必然只会使它自己在全世界更加陷于孤立而已。我们相信全世界爱好和平的人民一定会从联合国所上演的这一丑剧中进一步认清美帝国主义狰狞面目，加强反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的斗争，坚决粉碎它加剧国际紧张局势的阴谋。
    西藏是中国的领土，平定叛乱，实行民主改革完全是我国的内政，任何国家和国际组织都无权过问，联合国的决议完全是非法的，无效的。这个非法的决议绝对不能丝毫损害伟大的中华人民共和国，只是在联合国的历史上又增加了一次可耻的纪录而已。我国政府发表的声明，严厉谴责了美帝国主义的罪行，充分表达了我们全国人民的意志和决心，我们表示完全拥护。我们对美帝国主义的唯一回答，就是更加紧密地团结在中国共产党周围，全力支持西藏同胞的民主改革，加强解放台湾的斗争，彻底粉碎美帝国主义一切侵略阴谋，世界上是没有任何力量能够阻挡中国各族人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下胜利前进的。
              民盟主席沈钧儒说
    美帝国主义挑拨诬蔑不会达到任何目的
    新华社24日讯　中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    最近美帝国主义指使它的仆从国家，挟持联合国机构，指使一些仆从国家提出所谓“西藏问题”，对于我国内政进行粗暴的干涉。我国人民对此表示异常愤慨。昨天我国政府发表严正声明，痛加驳斥，反映了我国人民的意志和要求，这是十分正确的。我和中国民主同盟全体盟员完全同意并拥护这一声明。
    西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的领土。关于西藏平乱和西藏人民进行民主改革，完全是我国的内政问题，我国人民决不容许任何外国横加干涉。美帝国主义利用它的仆从国家，竟在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”，并且操纵联合国的表决机器，歪曲事实，颠倒是非，通过非法决议，这是我国人民所万不能承认的，也是全世界一切爱好和平、维护正义、主张公道的人士所一致反对的。
    我国政府平定西藏叛乱，是消灭西藏极端野蛮、反动、黑暗的农奴制度，使千千万万的西藏同胞从这种制度下解放出来，开始过着像我国其他各族人民一样的民主、平等、自由的幸福生活。这次西藏的革命取得伟大的胜利，是我国历史上的一件大事，是全世界和平和进步人士所同情和支持的。美帝国主义颠倒是非，挑拨诬蔑，是不会达到任何目的，只能暴露了它是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义这种行动，其用意在于加剧冷战，阻碍国际局势的缓和，所以不但我国人民坚决反对，凡是全世界一切关心和平的人士都将表示极端的愤慨。
        民建主任委员黄炎培说
    我国内政不容任何国家和国际组织干涉
    新华社24日讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    最近联合国大会在美帝国主义的操纵下，讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，使我们感到极大的愤慨。我们中国民主建国会的全体成员同全国人民一道坚决反对联合国的这一非法决议，强烈抗议美帝国主义挟持联合国干涉我国内政的卑鄙行径。
    西藏是我国的领土，正同任何人不能改变历史那样，这是任何人不能否认的铁一般的事实；在自己的领土上，平定叛乱、实行民主改革，使西藏绝大多数人民能够从黑暗、残酷、落后的农奴制度下解放出来，这完全是我国的内政，任何国家和国际组织都无权过问。美帝国主义为了加剧冷战，竟不顾全世界爱好和平人民和进步人士的反对，同西藏一小撮叛乱分子勾结起来，操纵它在联合国的表决机器通过荒谬无耻的决议，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。美帝国主义所以搞这种阴谋把戏，居心就是为了要使目前正在趋向和缓的国际局势重新紧张起来，以达到那些战争贩子扩军备战、攫取巨额军火利润的目的。这不仅蓄意同中国人民为敌，也是疯狂地同全世界爱好和平的人民为敌。
    我们要警告美帝国主义和它的追随者：西藏人民已经站起来了，不愿再做奴隶了，他们要过人的生活，他们正在亲手摧毁那吃人的农奴制度，建立民主、社会主义的新西藏。那一小撮叛乱分子只是一些没有丝毫用处的渣滓，不管他们如何同美帝国主义勾结，丝毫也不能阻挡西藏人民前进的步伐。老实说，即使美帝国主义开动它在联合国的表决机器通过一百个、一千个、一万个诬蔑中国的决议，对于站起来了的中国人民，对于站在正义这边的中国人民，损害不了我们的一根毫毛，反之，只会使全世界人民更加看清美帝国主义的狰狞面貌和强盗行径！等待着美帝国主义的只是又一次可耻的失败！
      全国工商联主任委员陈叔通说
  美国企图使正在缓和中的国际局势重新紧张
    新华社24日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    我们全国工商业者和全国人民一起，对于美帝国主义挟持联合国，通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，感到无比的愤慨；对于我国政府关于联合国通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明，表示坚决的拥护。
    美帝国主义公然违反联合国宪章，粗暴地干涉我国内政，这是我们决不能容忍的。西藏是我国神圣的领土，平定西藏一小撮上层反动分子的叛乱，完全是我国的内政，决不允许美帝国主义造谣诬蔑，进行干涉。我国政府在西藏平定叛乱，进行民主改革，使西藏百万同胞从农奴制的残酷奴役下解放出来，逐步走上社会主义的光明大道，是西藏人民的迫切要求，也是全国人民的坚决意志。美帝国主义所谓维护西藏人民的“基本人权”，所谓“同情西藏人民”等谎言，是妄图保存西藏黑暗的反动的农奴制，并且使正在缓和中的国际局势重新紧张起来。这又一次暴露了美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民最凶恶的敌人。我国各族人民在中国共产党领导下，更加团结一致，在社会主义道路上迈步前进，并且进一步团结全世界人民，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的无耻阴谋，为缓和国际紧张局势，保卫世界持久和平而坚决奋斗。
          民进副主席王绍鏊说
    美国的卑劣伎俩暴露了自己的丑恶面目
    新华社24日讯　中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊就美国挟持联合国通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，干涉我国内政事件发表谈话如下：
    最近联合国在美国策划和操纵下，竟然在大会会议上讨论并通过了所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，这是粗暴干涉我国内政、严重违反联合国宪章、危害国际和平与安全的非法行动。中国人民对此表示异常愤慨和坚决反对。
    今年3月间，西藏少数上层反动分子发动的武装叛乱早已迅速平息。西藏地区在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导和关怀下，在广大僧俗人民热烈要求和努力下，有步骤地进行着民主改革，已经取得了巨大成就，一百多万没有人身自由的农奴从黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制度下得到解放，从苦难的深渊走上了光明自由的道路。西藏广大僧俗人民正在欢欣鼓舞，为着自己的幸福前途，奋勇前进。这已经是众目共睹的事实。美国政府抬出所谓“尊重西藏人民的基本人权”的幌子，来颠倒是非，混淆黑白，这完全是对伟大的中国进行恶毒的诬蔑。这种卑劣的伎俩适足以在世界人民面前暴露它自己的帝国主义的丑恶面目。对于我国西藏地区人民的解放和前进是起不了丝毫影响的。
    必须指出，美国政府的这种罪恶活动，是它加剧国际紧张局势，坚持侵略政策的又一次疯狂表现。今天以苏联为首的和平民主力量的空前强大，全世界爱好和平人民的愿望空前强烈，中国六亿五千万各民族人民空前团结一致，美帝国主义的鬼蜮行径无论如何是不会得逞的。
    中国民主促进会全体会员坚决支持我国政府关于联合国大会十四届会议通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明，并决心和全国人民一道，用一切力量粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋活动。
      农工民主党主席团主席季方说
    国际反动派的任何干涉阴谋注定失败
    新华社24日讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会主席团主席季方就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    最近在美帝国主义的操纵下，联合国大会十四届会议非法讨论了所谓“西藏问题”，并且通过了一项诬蔑中华人民共和国的决议。这是以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派又一次粗暴干涉我国内政、践踏联合国宪章和蓄意加剧国际紧张局势的罪恶行为。我们农工民主党全体成员和全国人民一样，对此感到极大的愤慨，表示强烈的抗议，并完全支持我国政府关于联合国大会十四届会议通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明。
    西藏是中华人民共和国神圣领土的一部分。我国人民在自己的领土上平息西藏一小撮反动分子的叛乱，在西藏地区进行民主改革，纯属我国内部事务，任何外国或任何国际组织都无权过问。这次美帝国主义挟持一些国家公然在联合国大会上制造所谓“西藏问题”，通过所谓“西藏问题”的决议，完全是非法的，无效的。这种粗暴地干涉我国内政的罪恶行为，再一次证明了，美帝国主义是我国人民最凶恶的敌人；全世界人民也再一次看到，美帝国主义者为了抵制国际局势的缓和，正在竭力继续煽动和加剧“冷战”。这种危害世界和平和与中国人民为敌的做法，激起了我国人民对帝国主义更大的仇恨和反对。
    以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派的任何诽谤、任何干涉阴谋，丝毫也变动不了西藏历史发展的必然进程和西藏属于中国的事实，阻挡不了包括西藏人民在内的中国人民沿着社会主义的幸福大道向前迈进。可以肯定，正如同美帝国主义对我国历次的侵略和干涉一样，这一次的阴谋也必然要遭到可耻的失败，而我国的西藏人民却正在彻底摆脱了落后黑暗残酷的农奴枷锁而走向幸福和自由的光明大道。
            致公党主席陈其尤说
        中国人民不怕任何诬蔑和威胁
    新华社24日讯　中国致公党主席陈其尤就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    西藏千百年来就是我国的领土，我中央人民政府平定西藏上层反动分子发动的武装叛乱和实行民主改革，完全是我国的内政，任何国家和国际组织都无权过问，这是非常明白的事。然而美国的好战集团为了加剧国际“冷战”以免国际紧张局势有所和缓，最近竟然不顾苏联和社会主义各国的坚决反对和其他爱好和平的国家的不满，不顾违背联合国宪章明文规定不得干涉别国内政的原则，挟持它的仆从爱尔兰、马来亚两个国家出面提出所谓“西藏问题”在联合国进行讨论，并在美国操纵之下通过了所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议。这是极大的荒谬绝伦的罪恶行为，每一个中国人民对于美国帝国主义这种敌视我国人民，干涉我国内政的罪行，感到极大的愤慨和无比的仇恨。
    美帝国主义者说什么西藏人民的基本人权和自由被强行剥夺，这真是极尽造谣诬蔑之能事。事实是西藏人民千百年来在农奴制度之下，过着惨无人道的生活，他们的基本人权被统治阶级剥夺得一干二净，宗教信仰的自由更根本谈不到。只有在我国政府对叛乱分子实行讨伐，并平息叛乱之后，实行了民主改革，才使西藏人民获得基本人权获得真正宗教信仰的自由。大家知道，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营才真正是在全世界执行殖民主义，鼓励种族歧视，剥削和屠杀殖民地人民，侵略和侵犯殖民地人民的基本人权和文化的凶犯，请问美帝国主义者有什么资格谈维护基本人权。真是无耻至极。
    我们完全拥护我国政府1959年10月23日就联合国大会讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表的声明。我党全体成员对美帝国主义的诬蔑万分愤恨，予以强烈谴责，并誓以全力支持我国政府的一切外交政策。我们对联合国被美国所操纵再一次对中国人民做下极不友好和极不光彩的行动，因而使自己的威信下降，表示深深的遗憾。我们还要正告美国帝国主义者和它的帮凶们，中华人民共和国六亿五千万人民是不畏任何诬蔑和威胁的，你们的任何干涉我国内政的企图都将与以前的一切阴谋一样，归于可耻的失败。九三学社主席许德珩说非法决议使联合国历史上增一污点
    新华社24日讯　九三学社主席许德珩就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    美帝国主义为了蓄意加剧国际紧张局势、破坏国际和平、操纵并挟持联合国大会第十四届会议讨论并通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，我国政府为此发表严正声明，表示强烈的抗议。我们九三学社全体社员对于美帝国主义打着联合国旗帜，粗暴干涉中国内政，制造远东紧张局势的罪恶行为，表示极大的愤慨。我们对于我国政府的声明表示坚决的拥护。
    美国操纵联合国通过的所谓“西藏问题”的决议，完全是非法的、无效的。西藏是我国的领土，平定叛乱、实行民主改革完全是我国的内政，联合国和任何外国都无权干涉。美帝国主义要在这个纯属中国内政的问题上煽动反对中国，正好说明它是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。它仍然死抱着敌视中国的侵略政策，它只能更加激起中国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨和反对，它丝毫也变动不了西藏历史发展的必然进程和西藏全体人民要求民主改革的坚强意志，更丝毫影响不了包括西藏人民在内的我国各族人民的大团结。
    联合国宪章规定：联合国不得干涉任何国家的内政。美国挟持联合国大会第十四届会议通过干涉中国内政的非法决议，直接违背了联合国宪章的这一明确规定。这件事使联合国历史上增加了一个污点，再一次暴露了美国利用联合国制造紧张局势的罪恶行径。
    美帝国主义为了煽动一些国家敌视中国并毒化国际气氛，在通过的非法决议中，叫嚷所谓“人道原则”。这正好说明了美帝国主义所谓“人道”，就是维护剥皮挖眼的农奴制度。美帝国主义口里的“人道”，就是对人的奴役和酷刑。西藏人民遭受的奴役和酷刑，美帝国主义赞美为美好的制度。西藏正在进行民主改革来废除奴役和酷刑，美帝国主义却打着“人道”的招牌来阻挠，这正好说明美帝国主义是人道和人权的敌人。我们要正告美帝国主义者：你们的叫嚣是徒劳无功的，西藏的民主改革是任何人也阻挠不了的。
                台盟负责人说
  又一次证明美帝国主义是中国各族人民死敌
    新华社24日讯　台湾民主自治同盟负责人就联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议发表谈话如下：
    我国政府关于联合国大会十四届会议通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议的声明，表达了全中国人民的严正立场和极大的愤慨。台湾民主自治同盟全体成员完全拥护这一声明，并对美帝国主义敌视中国人民的罪恶行为表示强烈的抗议。
    西藏是中国神圣领土的一部分，任何外国或任何国际组织都无权干涉中国的内部事务。美帝国主义挟持联合国通过的所谓“西藏问题”的提案，是根本违反联合国宪章，是对中国内政的不可容忍的干涉行为，是非法的、无效的。这是美帝国主义者打着联合国的旗子对中国人民的又一次挑衅。这件事无可争辩地表明了，美帝国主义不顾全世界人民要求消除“冷战”的普遍愿望，继续坚持“冷战”政策，把联合国作为“冷战”的工具，蓄意制造紧张局势，力图阻挠国际局势的和缓。
    美帝国主义的这种罪恶勾当，又一次证明了美帝国主义是中国各族人民，特别是西藏人民真正自由解放的最凶恶的敌人。十年来美帝国主义从来没有停止过对中国的侵略和干涉。美帝国主义用武装霸占了我国领土台湾，积极从事制造“两个中国”的阴谋，以至企图用什么“全面战争”来相威胁，阻挠我国人民解放自己的领土台湾的神圣事业。但是美国的阴谋活动，只能更加激起中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的义愤。美国这次阴谋，毫无疑问注定要失败。尽管美帝国主义的造谣、诽谤、干涉和侵略，包括西藏人民在内的伟大的中国人民一定能够在社会主义幸福大道上迈步前进！台湾一定会解放！全世界各国人民争取继续和缓国际紧张局势的斗争一定能够取得胜利。
