    More than 600 congress preparatory staff members from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, the Science and Technology Association, and various central and Beijing municipal organs have been working together since after the National Day. The venue for the congress will be in the Great Hall of the People, and dozens of workers and staff are making arrangements inside.

The newly built Beijing Railway Station has also established a reception station, and has begun to warmly welcome delegates from all over the country who have arrived in Beijing one after another.

The film "Seize the Red Flag and Go to Beijing" has now been completed, and two other films reflecting the selfless labor of the broad masses of workers in our country to welcome the gathering of heroes are being produced.
