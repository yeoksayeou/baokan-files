　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th -- Our correspondent reports: Nearly ten million peasants in the plains and some mountainous areas of northern Vietnam have launched a heated debate about the "two roads." As of early October, Ninh Binh, Hung Yen, Thai Binh, Kien An, Phu Tho and other provinces have successively concluded the debate.

　　This debate was launched under the call and leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party. Through the debate, the peasants further distinguished the boundary between capitalism and socialism, recognized that taking the road of collectivization is the only path to happiness for the peasants, and thus further strengthened their determination to take the socialist road. The original cooperatives have been further consolidated. Mutual aid teams and individual farmers have requested to join the cooperatives one after another. After the debate in An My, My Hao, Kim Dong, and Van Giang counties in Hung Yen province, one hundred and twenty-three agricultural cooperatives were developed. The number of people participating in cooperatives in Kim Dong County has accounted for 43% of the total number of farmers. Many townships have realized collectivization throughout the township. Through the debate, the enthusiasm of farmers in production has also been further improved. At present, in the rural areas of northern Vietnam, great achievements have been made in striving for a bumper harvest of late rice, strengthening field management, and preparing for agricultural production this winter and next spring.

　　Since last winter, the collectivization movement in northern Vietnam has formed a mass movement. According to statistics in August this year, 16,150 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in northern Vietnam, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 21.5% of the total number of peasant households; in addition, 250,000 mutual aid teams have been established, and the number of peasant households joining the mutual aid teams accounts for 69.1% of the total number of peasant households. Agricultural cooperatives are increasingly showing their superiority, thereby setting an example for mutual aid teams and individual farmers and pointing out the direction of progress. However, some farmers still have concerns about joining cooperatives, and capitalist ideology still has a considerable influence in rural areas. In order to consolidate and develop the cooperatives, after piloting and gaining experience, local labor party organizations actively led the debate on the "two roads." Not only mutual aid teams and individual farmers participated in the debate, but also cooperative members. The debate adopted the method of fully stating the facts and reasoning. The vast number of peasants enthusiastically participated in this debate concerning their future. According to statistics, the number of people participating in the debate in various places generally accounts for more than 65% to 70% of the rural population. In many places, almost everyone except children, the sick, and the elderly participated in the debate. Farmers also used the "two roads" issue as a topic of conversation in the market and in the fields.

　　In the debate, cooperative members used their personal experiences and life comparisons to illustrate the superiority of the socialist system, and that only by listening to the words of the Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh and taking the road of collectivization can they get rid of poverty and obtain a happy life. Cadres also conducted sincere inspections and patient explanations of the problems existing in the cooperatives and the questions raised by the masses.

　　In villages and villages where the development of cooperatives was slow, mutual aid teams and individual farmers were also organized to visit the cooperatives.

　　越南农村展开“两条道路”大辩论
    广大农民更坚定了走社会主义道路的决心
    新华社河内16日电　本社记者报道：越南北方平原地区和部分山区广大农村的近一千万农民掀起了一个“两条道路”的辩论热潮。截至10月上旬为止，宁平、兴安、太平、建安、富寿等省已经先后结束辩论。
    这场辩论是在越南劳动党的号召和领导下展开的。经过辩论的地方，农民们进一步划清了资本主义和社会主义的界线，认清了走合作化道路才是农民唯一幸福的道路，因而更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。原有的合作社更加巩固了。变工组和单干的农民纷纷要求参加合作社。兴安省的安美、美豪、金洞、文江等县经过辩论，发展了一百二十三个农业社，金洞县参加合作社的人数已经占总农户的43％，许多乡已经全乡实现了合作化。经过辩论，还进一步提高了农民生产的积极性。目前，在越南北方农村，争取晚稻丰收、加强田间管理的工作和今冬明春农业生产的准备工作，都取得了很大的成绩。
    去冬以来，越南北方的合作化运动已经形成了群众性运动。根据今年8月份的统计，越南北方已经建立了一万六千一百五十个农业生产合作社，入社农户占农户总数的21.5％；此外，还建立了二十五万个变工组，加入变工组的农户占农户总数的69.1％。农业合作社日益显示出它的优越性，从而为变工组和单干农民树立了榜样，指出了前进的方向。但是，也还有些农民对加入合作社仍然存在着顾虑，资本主义思想在农村还有相当的影响。为了巩固和发展合作社，各地劳动党组织经过试点取得经验后，积极领导了“两条道路”的辩论。辩论不仅有变工组和单干农民参加，而且也在合作社社员中间展开。辩论采取了充分摆事实、讲道理的方法。广大农民热情地参加这个有关他们的前途的辩论。根据统计，各地参加辩论的人数，一般占农村人口的65％到70％以上，许多地方除了小孩、病人和高龄老人以外，几乎所有的人都参加了辩论。农民们上市场、在田间也把“两条道路”问题作为话题。
    在辩论中，合作社社员们以亲身的经历和生活的对比，说明社会主义制度的优越性，说明只有听劳动党和胡志明主席的话，走合作化的道路，才能摆脱穷困获得幸福的生活。干部们对于合作社存在的问题和群众提出的疑问，也进行了诚恳的检查和耐心的解释。
    在合作社发展较慢的乡、村还组织变工组和单干农民参观了合作社。
