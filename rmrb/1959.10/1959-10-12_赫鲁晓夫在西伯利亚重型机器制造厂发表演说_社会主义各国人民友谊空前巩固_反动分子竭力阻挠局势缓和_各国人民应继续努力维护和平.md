Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech on the 9th at a mass meeting of workers at the Siberian Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Krasnoyarsk. He said that after his visit to the United States, there had been some warming in relations between countries, and some reactionary elements were trying their best to harm the positive results recently achieved in easing international tensions.

Khrushchev emphasized that it is still necessary to wage a tenacious struggle for peace. He said that the imperialists are afraid that once the "Cold War" is eliminated and international tensions are eased, it will affect their profits. Because they have a large number of military orders to make money and get rich.

Khrushchev briefly talked about some of his conversations with Americans during his visit to the United States. Khrushchev said that in these conversations, some Americans had mentioned the so-called free dissemination of ideas more than once. They advised me that we must widely disseminate their specially selected books and movies in our country, and freely conduct broadcasting. They wanted to force us to accept all kinds of garbage that would poison the minds of the Soviet people. Can we do this? Of course not. We Soviet people do not want to enjoy harmful food poisoned by bourgeois ideological toxins.

I said to the Americans: Please establish our relationship according to the principle that we will buy from you what we need, and you will buy from us what you need. We take out the good things from each other and exchange the good things, and let ourselves eat the moldy things.

Khrushchev pointed out that for us Soviet people, there is nothing more sublime than the ideals of Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that decadent capitalism must be replaced by the victorious, advancing new system of socialism and communism. The sublime communist ideal is penetrating into the consciousness of the working people.

Khrushchev condemned some Americans' attempts to insist that the Soviet Union was interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Khrushchev said that they wanted to blame us for everything that went wrong (including the large-scale workers' strikes that occurred there). Khrushchev pointed out in response to this that the practice of blaming the communists for all the difficulties and contradictions of capitalism would not succeed. Since the existence of private ownership of the means of production and since the existence of classes, there has been a constant struggle between labor and capital, and this struggle will continue until those who create all the material wealth in life achieve final victory.

Khrushchev recalled that when we were in the United States, people often asked me if we were planning to launch a rocket to the moon when I visited the United States? I replied: You can do this too. Why didn't you launch your own rocket to the moon on the eve of my visit?

Khrushchev pointed out that our launching of artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets is a great event. The Soviet people received their graduation certificate in front of the whole world.

Khrushchev said that we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. He said that we have done a lot of work, but we have to do more work. Only when factories, collective farms, state farms, every scientific institution and school work hard and selflessly can we guarantee new achievements.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union can not only complete the Seven-Year Plan, but also overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan.

He pointed out that in order to ensure the rapid development of the national economy and the smooth realization of the transition from socialism to communism, we should do everything possible to develop science and technology and train more skilled experts. What surprised the Americans was that last year our country trained 94,000 engineers, while at the same time, their country only trained 35,000 engineers. We trained almost twice as many engineers as the United States. Khrushchev said that whoever can raise the level of science higher and train more experts will achieve greater achievements.

Khrushchev recalled that when US Vice President Nixon visited the Soviet Union, he had many conversations with Soviet people, including young people. Later, Nixon said that when he talked to Soviet young men and women, almost everyone told him that they were studying in a specialized school, or in a technical school, or in a non-boarding night school.

Khrushchev said that some of our enemies abroad comfort themselves with this idea, saying that the more educated people there are in the Soviet Union, the more people want to return to capitalism. Khrushchev said that only a person who has lost his mind can think like this. Does educating the people stifle socialism? The more educated people there are in our country, the more enthusiastic supporters of socialism they will become.

Khrushchev pointed out that everyone knows that the imperialists are vigorously publicizing that they are helping underdeveloped countries. But what do they actually give people? What they do is just as the saying goes, "Of course, you are willing to give others what is useless to you." They have been plundering in a big way in the past and are still plundering now, and they give a little bit of it to others. They are exploiting the people of economically underdeveloped countries. It can be seen that their approach is: first give you a kopek, and then take back a ruble.

Khrushchev continued, in the past, they also plundered our country. However, this era is gone forever, but now the imperialists are short-sighted and cannot see the facts of the past.

Khrushchev said that the reason why our achievements are so great is because we are not isolated today. The powerful socialist camp is growing and consolidating. The friendship between the peoples of socialist countries is unprecedentedly consolidated. All socialist countries help each other and confidently move towards our common great goal—socialism and communism.

Khrushchev said that when the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary attempted to overthrow the people's power, we believed that we had the internationalist responsibility to accept the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government to help the Hungarian working class and help the Hungarian working people crush the counter-revolutionary rebellion. And we completed this task. When I was in Hungary, I saw how deeply grateful and thankful the Hungarian people were to the Soviet Union for this brotherly assistance.

Khrushchev continued, the fraternal relations linking our country and Poland are being strengthened day by day. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the working people of Poland are confidently advancing along the road of building socialism.

He said that consolidated and unbreakable fraternal and friendly relations link the Soviet Union with the great People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and all countries in the powerful socialist camp. This friendship is our strength and one of the great sources of our common victory.

We have established good relations with peace-loving countries such as India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. The Emperor of Ethiopia visited the Soviet Union not long ago.

Khrushchev emphasized that we should continue to strengthen friendly relations with all countries in the future, consistently implement the principles of peaceful coexistence, and strive to consolidate peace in the world.

　　赫鲁晓夫在西伯利亚重型机器制造厂发表演说
    社会主义各国人民友谊空前巩固
    反动分子竭力阻挠局势缓和　各国人民应继续努力维护和平
    新华社11日讯　塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，9日在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克的西伯利亚重型机器制造厂职工举行的群众大会上发表了演说。他说，在他访问美国以后，国与国之间的相互关系有了一定的暖和，一些反动分子竭力来损害最近在缓和国际紧张局势方面所取得的积极结果。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，仍然必须进行顽强的斗争来争取和平。他说，帝国主义者害怕，一旦消除了“冷战”，消除了国际紧张局势，就会影响他们的利润。因为，他们有大批军事定货，靠此发财致富。
    赫鲁晓夫简短地谈到了一些关于他在美国同美国人士交谈的情况。赫鲁晓夫说，在这些交谈中，美国某些人士曾不止一次地谈到所谓自由地传播思想。他们劝我，在我国必须广泛传播他们特为挑选好的书籍、电影，自由地进行广播。他们想强迫我们接受毒化苏联人们意识的各种垃圾。难道我们能这样做吗？当然不能。我们苏联人不想享受为资产阶级思想毒素所毒化的有害的食物。
    我向美国人士说：请你们根据这样的原则来建立我们的关系，即我们将向你们购买我们所需要的东西，而你们向我们购买你们所需要的东西。我们彼此拿出好的东西，交换好的东西，而发霉的东西让自己吃吧。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，对我们苏联人民来说，没有比马克思列宁主义的理想更崇高的了。他指出，没落的资本主义一定被胜利前进的、新的社会主义、共产主义制度所代替。崇高的共产主义理想正深入到劳动人民的意识中。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责了美国某些人士想硬说苏联干涉别国内政的这种企图。赫鲁晓夫说，他们想把一切倒霉的事情（其中包括他们那里发生的工人大规模罢工）都归咎于我们。赫鲁晓夫针对这一点指出，把资本主义的各种困难和矛盾的责任都推到共产党人身上的做法是不能得逞的。自从有了生产资料私有制，自从有了阶级，劳资之间就在进行不断的斗争，而且这种斗争一直要进行到创造生活中一切物质财富的人取得最后胜利为止。
    赫鲁晓夫回顾说，我们在美国的时候，常常有人问我，我们是不是预定乘我前往美国访问的时候向月球发射火箭？我回答说：你们也可以这样做呀。为什么你们不在我来访问的前夕向月球发射自己的火箭呢？
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们发射人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭，这是伟大的事件。苏联人民在全世界面前拿到了毕业证书。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不能满足于现有的成就。他说，我们已经做了许多工作，但是还要做更多的工作。只有工厂、集体农庄、国营农场、每个科学机关和学校顽强地和忘我地劳动，我们才能有取得新的成就的保证。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联不仅能完成七年计划，而且能超额完成七年计划。
    他指出，为了保障国民经济的迅速发展，顺利地实现由社会主义到共产主义的过渡，应当尽一切可能来发展科学和技术，更多地培养熟练的专家。使美国人惊奇的是，去年我国培养了九万四千名工程师，而同一时间，在他们的国家只培养了三万五千名工程师。我们培养的工程师几乎比美国多二倍。赫鲁晓夫说，谁能把科学水平提得更高，能培养更多的专家，谁就能获得更大的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫追述说，当美国副总统尼克松访问苏联的时候，他曾经多次同苏联人们交谈过，也同青年交谈过。后来尼克松说，当他同苏联男女青年谈话时，几乎每个人都告诉他，他们在专科学校，或是在技术学校，或是在不脱产的夜校学习。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们国外的一些敌人以这种想法自我安慰，他们说，在苏联，受教育的人越多，表示希望回到资本主义去的人也就越多。赫鲁晓夫说，只有丧失理智的人才能这样推想。难道使人民受教育就会扼杀社会主义？我国受教育的人越多，他们就会成为社会主义的更加热情的拥护者。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，大家知道，帝国主义者大肆宣扬，说什么他们在援助不发达国家。可是他们实际上给人家的是什么呢？他们的所作所为正如俗语说的“对自己没有用处的东西当然舍得给别人”。他们过去和现在一直在大肆掠夺，而把其中的一点点给人家，他们是在剥削经济上不发达的各国人民。可见他们的做法是：先给你一个戈比，而后拿回一个卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，过去，他们也掠夺过我国。可是，这种时代已经一去不复返了，而现在帝国主义者却鼠目寸光，看不见过去的事实。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的成就之所以宏伟，是因为今天我们不是孤立的。强大的社会主义阵营正在成长和巩固。社会主义各国人民的友谊空前巩固。所有社会主义国家彼此互助，满怀信心地走向我们共同的伟大目标——社会主义、共产主义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当匈牙利的反革命势力企图推翻人民政权的时候，我们认为，我们负有接受匈牙利工农革命政府的请求帮助匈牙利工人阶级、帮助匈牙利劳动人民粉碎反革命叛乱的国际主义责任。而我们完成了这个任务。当我在匈牙利的时候，我看到，为了这种兄弟援助，匈牙利人民对苏联是怀着多么深厚的感激和谢意。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，把我国和波兰联结在一起的兄弟关系在日益加强，波兰的劳动人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下正在满怀信心地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。
    他说，巩固的、牢不可破的兄弟般的友好关系把苏联同伟大的中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚，同强大的社会主义阵营中的所有国家联结在一起。这个友谊是我们的力量、是我们共同胜利的伟大泉源之一。
    我们同印度、阿富汗、印度尼西亚、埃塞俄比亚这样一些爱好和平的国家建立了良好的关系，埃塞俄比亚的皇帝不久前还访问过苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，我们今后仍然应当同一切国家加强友好关系，始终如一地实现和平共处的原则，为巩固全世界的和平而斗争。
