How Can One Not Be Moved By Qin腔 Opera
Actor Liu Yuzhong

During the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, I was honored to participate in the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing as a tribute. On the way to Beijing, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. One moment I would stick my head out of the train window to look at the ever-changing construction scenes across the motherland. The next, I would lie on my bunk contemplating my past and present, filled with indescribable excitement and emotion.

I am sixty-four years old this year. Counting from the second year of the Republic of China when I began to learn opera, I have been on the stage for forty-seven years. But I should truly say that I have only been a person, an actor of the people, since 1949. In the old society, under feudal rule and warlord autocracy, we were only called "stinky actors," treated as inferiors, and forbidden from being buried in the ancestral graves after death. On October 1, 1949, the five-star red flag was raised for the first time in the sky over our motherland. Under the glorious light of the red five-star, we artists finally raised our heads and straightened our backs. This old artist, once called a "stinky actor," is now a provincial people's representative who manages state affairs, the vice-chairman of the provincial Drama Association, and the vice-president of the historically renowned troupe, the Xi'an Yisu Society, a Qin腔 opera actor beloved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Thinking of all this, how can one not be excited, how can one not be moved!

Everything has changed since arriving in Beijing. Especially meeting with colleagues from Han opera, Sichuan opera, Cantonese opera, Yue opera, Northern and Southern Kunqu opera, Peking opera, Ping opera, Yu opera, Hebei Bangzi opera, Gansu Daoqing opera, as well as song and dance dramas, spoken dramas... everyone gathering together has created a flourishing scene of vibrant colors and a hundred flowers blooming in the people's capital arts scene. I remember when I came to Beijing in 1952 to participate in the first National Opera Festival, I was extremely excited because after performing for decades in the old society, all I knew was Qin腔 opera and Mei Hu opera. I went to Wuhan in the tenth year of the Republic of China and learned about Han opera and Chu opera. When I met Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's Nantong Linggong Academy in Wuhan, I learned about Peking opera. Wow! At the 1952 festival in Beijing, I saw twenty-three different types of opera, and realized that our China has so many local operas. After watching the performances, each had its own strengths and unique features. Everyone observed and learned from each other, exchanging experiences. This was an unprecedented grand gathering that had never occurred since the beginning of time. I learned a lot and broadened my horizons at that festival. In particular, the Party lit a bright lamp in the hearts of us artists, which was the eight-character policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao at the festival. Seven years have passed, and we have come to Beijing again to celebrate the tenth anniversary of our great motherland's founding, meeting with even more colleagues from more types of opera. Moreover, each type of opera has seen new developments and improvements. This is the victory of the Party's correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." Seeing all this, how can I not be excited, how can I not be moved?

Our Qin腔 opera is an ancient flower in the great garden of the motherland. Because it is closely linked with the broad masses of working people (in the Northwest, especially the Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi, almost everyone can sing and loves it), it has a history of over a thousand years. However, because the feudal ruling class in the old society regarded opera as a vulgar pastime, it suffered all sorts of persecution. Since I can remember, I have personally witnessed how many diligent and hardworking artists who inherited and enriched the art of Qin腔 opera became displaced, and some even starved to death. Take myself as an example. I performed for thirty-seven years in the old society, and there was no way to talk about art. I was always worried about making a living, running around and joining troupes everywhere, suffering all kinds of torture. Diligent study and hard work were only for winning applause from the audience and gaining personal fame, so that my livelihood would be more secure. And so it went until before liberation, when I saw Qin腔 opera gradually wither and become nearly exhausted, with no one to succeed it. The artists of my generation either grew old, or the troupe owners kicked them out when they could no longer make money. Large numbers of people became unemployed. Some pulled rickshaws, some worked as tea servers, some watched bicycles, some stoked the fire for tea stoves... It was a heartbreaking sight. In the spring of 1949, a thunderclap rang out, and Xi'an was liberated. The artists also stood up. In 1950, I returned to the Yisu Society led by the Party. My life became stable. The Party and the government cared for the artists in every possible way. They sent cadres to the society to teach us politics and culture, which brightened our eyes and made it clear that opera only has a broad future if it serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In art, they taught us to grasp the theme of the play, understand the plot, and analyze the characters' personalities, and how to arrange the singing and performance according to the plot and characters' personalities. This gave us a youthful artistic life and made us truly actors of the people. Since the Party put forward the correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," our Qin腔 opera art has become even more prosperous. Old artists "returned to the ranks." For example, I know that the famous artist Wang Wenpeng, who was forced to leave the stage due to poverty before liberation and wandered around unable to maintain his livelihood, the famous Qin腔 opera actress An Hongyin (fifty-eight years old) who worked as a tea server and stoked fires, and the displaced veteran artists Tian Denian (seventy-one years old) and Jin Fuchang (sixty-eight years old), all returned to the troupe. They not only regained their artistic youth and returned to the stage, but also enthusiastically imparted their years of accumulated artistic wealth to the younger generation without compensation. The Party and the government attached great importance to cultivating new forces for Qin腔 opera, recruiting students every year and continuously expanding the ranks. Over the past few years, they have trained thousands of young actors, among whom many rising stars have emerged, such as Ma Lanyu, Li Jizu, Li Yingzhen, Chen Miaohua, Xiao Ruolan, and Li Aiqin, who came to Beijing this time to present tribute performances. They have all inherited many valuable legacies to varying degrees. Moreover, through the Party's cultivation and education and their own diligent study and hard work, Qin腔 opera art has become more rich and colorful. In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic, our Qin腔 opera has unearthed more than two thousand traditional plays. In accordance with the spirit of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," we have discarded the dross, refined the essence, and adapted and reorganized a large number of excellent plays. The traditional plays "Tour of West Lake," "Three Drops of Blood," and "The Orphan of Zhao" performed by our Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe in Beijing this time are part of the plays that have been repeatedly revised and adapted. It shows the rebirth and prosperity of our Qin腔 opera art. This is just the beginning of the first ten years! I believe that in the future, under the correct guidance of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," our Qin腔 opera art will become increasingly youthful and prosperous like other types of opera. Thinking of all this, how can one not be excited, how can one not be moved!

    怎能叫人不激动秦腔
    演员　刘毓中
    在庆祝建国十周年节日的时候，我荣幸地参加了陕西省戏曲演出团，到首都北京来作献礼演出，进京的路上，我辗转不能入睡，一忽儿把头伸向列车窗外，看看祖国各地日新月异的建设图景，一忽儿躺在睡铺上沉思自己的过去和今天，内心里有说不出的兴奋和激动。
    我今年六十四岁了，从民国二年我开始学戏算起，舞台生活已经四十七年了，但我真正作为一个人，作为一个人民的演员，却应该说是从1949年算起，因为在旧社会封建统治和军阀专横下，别人只叫我们是“臭戏子”，见人低三辈，死了入不了祖坟。1949年的10月1日，五星红旗第一次在祖国的天空中升起，在红五星的光辉照耀下，我们艺人才抬起了头，伸起了腰，我这个被称为“臭戏子”的老艺人，如今成了管理国家大事的省人民代表，省剧协的副主席和历史悠久的剧团——西安易俗社的副社长，成为工农兵群众热爱的秦腔演员了。想起了这些，怎能叫人不兴奋，怎能叫人不激动！
    到了北京，一切变了样，特别是见到了汉剧、川剧、粤剧、越剧、南北昆曲、京剧、评剧、豫剧、河北梆子、甘肃道情，还有歌舞剧、话剧……的同行们，大家欢聚在一起，使人民首都艺坛上呈现出了万紫千红、百花齐放的繁荣景象。记得1952年我来北京参加第一届全国戏曲会演时，心情是十分激动的，因为我在旧社会演了几十年戏，就只知道有个秦腔、郿鄠，民国十年到过武汉，知道还有个汉剧、楚剧，在武汉遇见欧阳予倩先生领导的南通伶工学社，才知道还有个京剧。嗨呀！1952年会演到了北京，见到了二十三个剧种，才知道我们中国有这么多的地方戏曲，看了戏后，各有所长，都有独到之处，大家在一起相互观摩学习，彼此交流经验。这是盘古至今从来没有过的空前盛会。我在那次会演中，学了不少东西，长了许多见识，特别是党在我们艺人心上点燃了一盏亮堂堂的明灯，那就是在会演中我们伟大领袖毛主席给我们提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”八个大字的方针。时过七年，在我们伟大祖国建国十周年的节日里，我们又来到了北京，同更多剧种的更多同行们会见了，而且各个剧种都有了新的发展和提高，这是党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的正确方针的胜利，见到这些，我怎能不兴奋，怎能不激动。
    我们的秦腔，是祖国大花园中一枝古老的花朵，因为它和广大劳动人民紧紧结合在一起（在西北，特别是陕西关中平原，差不多人人会唱，个个喜爱），已有上千年历史了。但是由于旧社会封建统治阶级把戏曲当作下流的消遣品，遭到了无奇不有的迫害，从我记事的时候起，亲眼见到了多少位勤学苦练、继承和丰富了秦腔艺术的艺人流离失所，甚至还有饿死的。就拿我个人来说，旧社会演了三十七年戏，那里说得上搞什么艺术，整天为饭碗担心，东奔西跑，到处搭班，受尽了折磨，勤学苦练也只不过是为了争取观众叫个好，混点个人名声，好使自己的饭碗牢靠些。就这样直到解放前，眼见秦腔这朵花由逐渐枯萎到快要枯竭了，后继无人，同辈的艺人们有的老了，箱主们见他们不能挣钱了就一脚踢开，大批人失业了，有的拉胶皮车，有的当茶房，有的看自行车，有的给茶炉拉风匣烧火……令人触目伤心。1949年春天，一声春雷响，西安解放了，艺人们也翻身了。1950年我回到了由党领导的易俗社，生活固定了，党和政府无微不至的关怀艺人，给社里派来了干部，教我们学政治，学文化，使我们眼睛亮了，使我们明确了戏曲只有为工农兵服务才有广阔的前途。在艺术上教我们掌握戏的主题思想，领会剧情和分析角色性格，如何根据剧情和角色性格去安排唱腔和表演，使我们有了青春的艺术生命，真正的成为人民的演员，自从党提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的正确方针后，我们秦腔艺术更加欣欣向荣，老艺人“归队”了，例如我所知道的在解放前为生活所迫退出舞台、到处流浪、无法维持生活的名艺人王文鹏、当茶房拉风匣的秦腔名旦安鸿印（五十八岁）、流离失所的名老艺人田德年（七十一岁）、晋福长（六十八岁）等，都回到了剧团，他们不仅恢复了艺术青春，重新登台演出，而且热忱地把自己多少年积累的艺术财富，无偿的传授给青年一代。党和政府对培养秦腔新生力量极为重视，年年招收学生，不断地壮大队伍，几年来培养了数以千计的青年演员，其中也出现了不少的后起之秀，如这次来京献礼演出的马兰鱼、李继祖、李应真、陈妙华、萧若兰、李艾琴等，他们都不同程度的继承了许多宝贵的遗产。而且经过党的培养教育及自己的勤学苦练，刻苦钻研，使秦腔艺术更加丰富多采了。建国十年来，我们秦腔挖掘出了二千多个传统剧目，根据“推陈出新”的精神，经过去芜存菁，加工整理出了大批的优秀剧目，我们陕西省戏曲演出团这次来京献礼演出的传统剧“游西湖”、“三滴血”、“赵氏孤儿”等，就是经过反复修改加工剧目中的一部分，它显示了我们秦腔艺术的新生和繁茂。这还仅仅只是开头的十年啊！我相信我们秦腔艺术今后在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针正确指导下，将会和其他剧种一样日益青春繁茂。我想起了这些，怎能叫人不兴奋，怎能叫人不激动！
