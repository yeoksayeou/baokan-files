The Glorious and Great Ten Years
Cheng Qian, Vice-Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

(I)
In the first fifty years of the twentieth century, three of the most significant events in human history occurred: the victory of the Russian October Revolution in 1917, the victory of the world's democratic forces in the anti-fascist war in 1945, and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

"The victory of the October Revolution is a fundamental turning point in human history, a fundamental turning point in the historical destiny of world capitalism, a fundamental turning point in the world proletarian liberation movement, and a fundamental transformation in the methods and organizational forms, habits and traditions, culture and thought of the struggle of the exploited masses of the world." (Stalin: "The International Character of the October Revolution") The October Revolution pointed out a path: the proletarians and all the exploited and oppressed laborers, under the leadership of their own political party, unite their own class and all the forces that can be united to fight, can smash the heavy shackles on themselves and achieve liberation.

The victory of World War II was a victory for the world's democratic forces, a victory for the people. It shattered the vast aggressive plans of the German, Italian and Japanese "anti-communist axis" to annex the world. It saved human civilization. "Those who play with fire will burn themselves," therefore, it is actually a severe warning to all war maniacs who want to follow in the footsteps of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. The direct result of the victory of the anti-fascist World War II is: it strengthened the socialist forces, and after the war, a series of socialist countries were born in Eastern Europe; it strengthened the national revolutionary forces, and the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America erupted vigorously; it strengthened the forces of peace, and the kind-hearted people of the world, regardless of skin color or race, united unprecedentedly under the great banner of defending peace.

The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, and the announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China, is a fundamental turning point in the long history of a five-thousand-year-old civilized country. It ended the rule of China's last reactionary regime and ended the era of profound suffering for the Chinese people. The era that Sun Yat-sen dreamed of, of "leaping forward with the times," "elevating China to the realm of wealth and strength, and bringing peace and happiness to its people" has arrived. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has made the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp far greater than the strength of the imperialist aggression camp. The era of imperialism's decline has arrived, and the era of all roads leading to communism has arrived. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has set a victorious example of the liberation struggle for the people of the colonies and semi-colonies. The era of oppressed and enslaved people breaking free from colonial chains has arrived, and the era of the total collapse and complete disintegration of the colonial system has arrived. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is a new victory for Marxism-Leninism in a large country with a population of 650 million. It demonstrates the power of Marxism-Leninism, and it also greatly enriches and develops the theoretical arsenal of Marxism-Leninism. The great era of the flourishing of Marxism-Leninism, with its mighty and unstoppable powerful vitality, grasping and arming the minds of the working people of the world has arrived.

The victory of the October Revolution, the victory of the anti-fascist World War, and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. This is the continuous development of the cause of human progress, the beginning of which began with the October Revolution. Without the October Revolution, without the powerful defense and economic strength of the Soviet Union, the anti-fascist forces of World War II could not have achieved victory. Without "the sound of the October Revolution bringing us Marxism-Leninism" (Mao Zedong: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"), the great Chinese Communist Party could not have been born, and without the Chinese Communist Party leading the entire Chinese people in twenty-eight years of arduous and unyielding struggle, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution would not have been possible. The Chinese people are advancing victoriously along the path of the October Revolution, and the Chinese people regard their own revolution and construction as a continuation of the October Revolution. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist construction over the past ten years have been achieved under the illumination of the path of the October Revolution and the guidance of the Soviet Union's construction experience.

Celebrating the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we firmly and proudly say: we, the Chinese people, will continue to hold high the red flag of the October Revolution and bravely advance along the path of the October Revolution opened up by the heroes of Petrograd!

(II)
October 1, 1949, is a watershed in Chinese history, dividing two completely different eras.

The old China was an era of boundless darkness in which demons held power and ghosts danced wildly, an era of boundless suffering in which the broad masses of the people were plunged into deep water and scorching fire. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, thousands upon thousands of people with lofty ideals, including Mr. Sun Yat-sen, had engaged in long-term and repeated struggles for the fate of the motherland and the nation. Their struggles had achieved partial victories and had to some extent promoted the advancement of the wheels of history. However, from the overall perspective, their struggles all ended in failure. And contrary to expectations, the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang faction of Chiang Kai-shek was produced, which was a joint rule of international imperialism, Chinese feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and was the most reactionary, darkest, cruelest, and most ferocious dynasty in Chinese history. This bloody dynasty inherited all the experience of the anti-revolutionary rule of the feudal rulers of modern China, such as Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, etc. This dynasty and its representatives felt that "nothing under heaven is poison to me," and plunged the Chinese people into a sea of ​​deep disaster. Political corruption, secret agents rampant, arbitrary destruction, harming the people to indulge in; cultural backwardness, epidemic diseases rampant, greed and extravagance, corruption and injury; exorbitant taxes and levies, clever robbery and seizure, economic carving, inflation, starvation everywhere, people do not live: All of these are the tragic and bleak picture of the old China. It is necessary to end this old era and create a new era for the people; it is necessary to overthrow this old China and create a new China in which the people are the masters: This is the conclusion drawn by the Chinese people from the lessons of long-term real life.

The new China of the new era forms a sharp contrast with the old China of the old era.

Ten years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong solemnly declared to the world: "Our nation will no longer be a nation that is insulted, we have stood up." Later, when our country's economic construction entered a period of upsurge, Chairman Mao Zedong said again: "The working people of 9.6 million square kilometers of the People's Republic of China have now truly begun to rule this place." Once the power of the state is in the hands of the organized and led people who have stood up, it will exert a huge and invincible force, and it will be possible to create a large amount of material wealth, end the people's tragic and occasionally scarce life, and enable the country and society to leap forward. On September 29, 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference formulated a "Common Program." This "Common Program" played the role of a temporary constitution. The preface to the "Common Program" pointed out: "The Chinese people have changed from the oppressed position to become the masters of the new society and the new country, and replaced the Kuomintang reactionary rule of feudal comprador fascist dictatorship with the people's democratic dictatorship republic. The Chinese People's Democratic Dictatorship is the people's democratic united front regime of the Chinese working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie and other patriotic democratic elements, based on the alliance of workers and peasants and led by the working class." On September 20, 1954, the First Session of the First National People's Congress solemnly adopted the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China." The "Constitution" stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." "The People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, to ensure the gradual elimination of the exploitation system and the establishment of a socialist society." The "Common Program" and the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" developed on the basis of the "Common Program" fundamentally affirmed the national character and political system of our country, which made our country end the state of people's lack of power in a very wide range and promoted a high degree of democracy. The "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" pointed out: "Eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society," which solves a fundamental issue that people have long debated in modern Chinese history - the issue of China's way out. Taking the socialist road is the only correct road. All attempts to reverse the giant wheel of history and reverse the car run counter to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and will inevitably be spurned and opposed by the Chinese people.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, over the past ten years, the Chinese people have relied on the people's democratic dictatorship regime and the power of the broadest and fullest mobilized masses to completely and victoriously complete the tasks left over from the bourgeois democratic revolution. We carried out the struggle to clear bandits and oppose hegemony, and eliminated the pests such as "East Tyrant" and "West Tyrant" who rode on the people's heads and bullied the people. We carried out the land reform movement to eliminate the root cause of China's poverty and backwardness for thousands of years - the feudal exploitation system. We carried out democratic reform movements in factories and mines to abolish and revise the old rules and regulations that bound social productive forces. We carried out the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and basically eliminated the hidden counter-revolutionaries and special agents. We respected the history of dozens of fraternal ethnic groups, established autonomous regions, states, and counties, and equally and effectively developed their economies and cultures, uniting them as solid as a rock. When the young People's Republic of China had just been established for a year, the ferocious American imperialism launched a military aggression against Korea. The American aggressor troops pressed towards the Yalu River, seriously threatening our country's security. The Chinese people held high the righteous banner of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Country," organized a powerful Chinese People's Volunteer Army, "valiant and spirited, crossing the Yalu River," and together with the Korean People's Army, dealt a heavy blow to the American modernized army. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, after two years and nine months of victorious battles in Korea, frustrated the American aggression plan and forced the American aggressors to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. The myth of "American invincibility" was broken from then on, and the essentially weak nature of the American paper tiger was exposed before the people of the world. After completely and victoriously completing the bourgeois democratic revolution, the people of our country carried out and are continuing to carry out the socialist revolution. We carried out the great Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, smashing the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks. In 1956, our country basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in terms of the private ownership of the means of production. The individual economy of 120 million peasant households and more than 6 million handicraftsmen was transformed into a collective economy; 70,000 private industrial enterprises were transformed into joint state-private enterprises; nearly 2 million private stores of all sizes were transformed into joint state-private stores, cooperative stores, cooperative groups, or directly into state-owned stores. The private ownership of the means of production for thousands of years has been transformed into socialist public ownership, which is a great socialist revolution. In 1957, we carried out the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist revolution is still continuing to develop in depth, and it can be predicted with certainty that it will further adjust and transform the relations of production under our country's socialist system, further liberate the minds of the working people, further improve the socialist and communist consciousness of the whole people, and further liberate the inexhaustible and endless social productive forces inherent in our society and our working people, so that our country's socialist construction will show an ever-changing situation of leaping forward even more.

Our country's socialist construction is carried out simultaneously with the socialist revolution. On the one hand, we are revolutionizing the social relations between people, and on the other hand, we are revolutionizing the relations between people and nature. Before 1953, we successfully carried out the arduous task of healing war wounds and restoring the national economy. Starting in 1953, we carried out a magnificent First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which was successfully completed and overfulfilled in 1957. On the basis of the victories achieved on the economic, ideological, and political fronts in 1957, under the illumination of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" formulated by the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, promoted the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and engaged in selfless, tense, and joyful labor with soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of bold innovation, creating an unprecedented national economic great leap forward. The actual grain harvest in 1958 was 500 billion jin, an increase of 35% over 1957. The actual cotton harvest in 1958 was 42 million dan, an increase of 28% over 1957. During the First Five-Year Plan, our country's steel production increased by a total of 4 million tons (from 1.35 million tons in 1952 to 5.35 million tons in 1957), an average annual net increase of 800,000 tons, with an average annual growth rate of 31.7%. In 1958, our country's "foreign steel" production reached 8 million tons, an increase of 49.5% over 1957. In 1958, our country's coal production was 270 million tons, more than double that of 1957. In 1958, our country's living standards increased by 6.7% compared with 1957, of which farmers increased by 9.7%. In 1959, a new high tide of the Great Leap Forward has taken shape, and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a great battle call: this year, in terms of major industrial and agricultural products, to complete the main targets originally scheduled to be completed in the last year (1962) of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Under the encouragement of this great call, under the illumination of the general line, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country are holding high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward and marching forward to realize a new and greater leap forward in 1959.

After briefly comparing the situations of the old and new eras and the old and new China, and after briefly reviewing the brilliant and magnificent achievements of the new China over the past ten years, we look forward to the future with revolutionary optimism and feel very excited. Our hearts are filled with pride in yesterday and confidence in tomorrow. Ten Years ago, the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out: "China's economic heritage is backward, but the Chinese people are brave and hardworking. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, plus the assistance of the proletariat of all countries in the world, mainly the assistance of the Soviet Union, the speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in a short time. There is no basis for the pessimistic view of China's economic recovery." The Marxist-Leninist scientific prediction of the Chinese Communist Party has been proven by the historical facts of the past ten years and will continue to be proven by future facts. The Chinese people are eagerly demanding to quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness" and strive to build their country into a prosperous, happy, and strong socialist country after several five-year plans. The entire Chinese people, armed with this noble ideal, will surely move from one victory to another. No difficulties can scare us. The attacks of all reactionary forces at home and abroad cannot stop our progress.

(III)
During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, a new form of social organization - the People's Commune - appeared in China, Asia. Immediately afterwards, a great battle of the whole people refining steel began. These two great revolutionary mass movements have achieved very great results: 120 million peasant households throughout China have been organized into more than 26,000 people's communes with large scale, integration of government and commune, integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fishery; the workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises and transportation lines in large, medium, and small cities across China and 90 million farmers have invested in the upsurge of the whole people refining steel, which made the steel production in 1958 skyrocket to 11.08 million tons (including 3 million tons of indigenous steel suitable for making agricultural tools), an increase of more than double that of 1957.

People have had some discussions on these two great revolutionary mass movements. We are not afraid of discussions. Chairman Mao said, "More people, more discussions, and higher enthusiasm," which is indeed a good thing. The problem is: these discussions come from reactionary and hostile forces at home and abroad. They "attack one point without considering the rest." They turn a blind eye to brilliant achievements, hold strange minds of hunting for novelty and seizing differences, and rack their brains to find shortcomings, and describe these two great revolutionary mass movements as "pitch black." We believe that, from an objective point of view, pouring cold water on the revolutionary mass movement and venting energy is as criminal as wantonly slandering and defaming the great creations of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, and they are all serving the reactionaries. Therefore, it is necessary for us to counterattack them, in order to increase the ambition of the revolutionary masses and destroy the prestige of hostile forces at home and abroad.

The People's Commune movement wants to "cut off the root of thousands of years of private ownership," the mass steel refining movement wants to greatly advance the realization of our country's industrialization plan, and all revolutionary mass movements want to make our country prosperous and strong, which will inevitably make the imperialist elements abroad panic and foolishly slander us; this will inevitably arouse the resistance from the class instinct of the reactionary bourgeois forces at home. We are full of enthusiasm to care for, love, support, and cultivate the sprouts of all new things, and we are full of enthusiasm to cheer for all revolutionary mass movements, but our hostile forces at home and abroad hold a deep-seated attitude of abhorrence towards this. The colors of emotion are so distinct that we cannot help but come to the conclusion: Whatever the enemy "hates and wants to die," we must "love and want to live"; whatever things the enemy slander and defame wantonly are the common interests of our people, and we must be determined to do it, and move forward without hesitation until complete success.

The People's Commune is a thing with vitality, a product of the Great Leap Forward, the direction of historical development, and the great creation of the people. Its superiority has been greatly demonstrated in the past year's steel refining, autumn harvest and sowing, this year's spring harvest and sowing, summer harvest and autumn planting, and the struggle against drought in summer and autumn, and it is moving forward along the road of consolidation and sound development. The People's Commune is not only a great force that can pool wisdom and efforts to fight against nature, but also a good foundation for farmers to transform from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism. The people's steel-making has increased national wealth, identified national geological resources, trained a large number of technical talents, and exercised people's minds. It is a great gain and no loss. Hostile forces at home and abroad want to make an article on these two issues, which only gives us another opportunity to recognize that this is a futile and ugly act, and increases our revolutionary drive.

While celebrating the glorious and great ten years, let us shout loudly:
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party
Long live Chairman, the Great Leader of the Chinese People!

    光辉和伟大的十年
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席　程潜
    （一）
    二十世纪的前五十年，在人类历史上发生了三个最伟大的事件：1917年俄国十月革命的胜利，1945年全世界民主力量反法西斯战争的胜利，1949年中国人民大革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立。
    “十月革命的胜利是人类历史中的根本转变，是世界资本主义历史命运中的根本转变，是世界无产阶级解放运动中的根本转变，是全世界被剥削群众的斗争方法和组织形式、生活习惯和传统、文化和思想上的根本转变。”（斯大林：“十月革命的国际性质”）十月革命指出了一条道路：无产者和一切被剥削、被压迫的劳动者，在自己的政党领导下，团结本阶级的以及一切可以团结的力量，进行斗争，就能够粉碎压在自己身上的沉重枷锁，获得解放。
    第二次世界大战的胜利，是全世界民主力量的胜利，是人民的胜利。它粉碎了德、意、日“反共轴心”吞并世界的巨大侵略计划。它拯救了人类的文明。“玩火者必自焚”，因此，它对于一切想步希特勒、墨索里尼、东条后尘的战争狂人们，实际上又是给了一个严厉的警告。反法西斯的第二次世界大战胜利的直接结果是：它壮大了社会主义势力，战后，东南欧一系列社会主义国家诞生了；它壮大了民族革命势力，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动风起云涌地爆发了；它壮大了保卫和平的力量，全世界不分肤色种族的善良人类，在保卫和平的大纛下空前地团结起来了。
    占世界人口四分之一的中国人民革命的伟大胜利，中华人民共和国的宣告成立，是五千年文明古国的悠久历史的根本转折。它结束了中国最后一个反动政权的统治，结束了中国人民苦难深重的时代。孙中山先生梦寐以求的“乘时一跃”、“登中国于富强之域，跻斯民于安乐之天”的时代已经到来。中国人民大革命的胜利，使世界和平民主阵营的力量大大超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，帝国主义走下坡路的时代已经到来，条条道路通往共产主义的时代已经到来。中国人民大革命的胜利，为殖民地半殖民地的人民大众，树立了解放斗争的胜利榜样。被压迫、被奴役的人们挣脱殖民锁链的时代已经到来，殖民主义体系总崩溃和全盘瓦解的时代已经到来。中国人民大革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义在一个六亿五千万人口的大国的新胜利，它显示了马克思列宁主义的威力，它同时也大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的理论武库。马克思列宁主义学说大兴大旺，以沛然莫之能御的强大生命力，掌握和武装全世界劳动人民头脑的伟大时代已经到来。
    十月革命的胜利，反法西斯世界大战的胜利，中国人民大革命的胜利。这是人类进步事业的连续发展，其发端则始于十月革命。没有十月革命，没有强大的苏联的国防力量和经济力量，第二次世界大战反法西斯力量就不可能取得胜利。没有“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”（毛泽东：“论人民民主专政”），就不可能诞生伟大的中国共产党，而没有中国共产党领导全中国人民进行二十八年艰苦卓绝的战斗，中国人民大革命的胜利也就不可能取得。中国人民是沿着十月革命的道路胜利前进的，中国人民把自己的革命和建设事业，看成是十月革命的继续。中国人民大革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，我国十年来社会主义建设事业的光辉成就，正是在十月革命道路的照耀下和苏联建设经验的指引下取得的。
    庆祝中国人民大革命的胜利，庆贺中华人民共和国建国十周年，我们坚定地自豪地说：我们中国人民将继续高举十月革命的红旗，沿着彼得格勒英雄们开辟的十月革命的道路奋勇前进！
          （二）
    1949年10月1日，是中国历史的一个分水岭，它划分了两个迥然不同的时代。
    旧时代的中国，是一个恶魔当权、群鬼乱舞的无边黑暗的时代，是广大人民群众陷于水深、火热的无边苦难的时代。中华民族的优秀儿女，成千上万的仁人志士，包括孙中山先生在内，曾经为了祖国的、民族的命运，进行过长期反复的斗争。他们的斗争取得过局部的胜利，在一定程度上也推动了历史车轮前进。但是，从总的方面来看，他们的斗争都是以失败而告终的。并且适得其反，产生了蒋介石国民党反动派的统治，它是国际帝国主义、中国的封建主义和官僚资本主义的联合统治，是中国历史上最反动的、最黑暗的、最残酷的、最凶恶的王朝。这个血腥王朝，继承了中国近代封建统治者西太后、袁世凯、段祺瑞、曹锟、吴佩孚等反革命统治的全部经验，这个王朝及其代表人物觉得“天下莫予毒”，把中国人民纳入了灾难深重的血海之中。政治腐败，特务横行，恣睢灭裂，残民以逞；文化落后，病疫猖獗，贪奢淫佚，败俗伤风；横征暴敛，巧劫豪夺，经济雕敝，通货膨胀，饿莩遍野，民不聊生：所有这些，就是旧时代旧中国的悲惨黯淡的画面。必须结束这个旧时代，创造人民的新时代；必须推翻这个旧中国，创造人民当家作主的新中国：这就是中国人民在长期现实生活的教训中得出来的结论。
    新时代的新中国，和旧时代的旧中国，形成了鲜明的对比。
    十年前，毛泽东主席庄严地向全世界宣告：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。”以后，当我国经济建设进入高涨时期，毛泽东主席又说：“中华人民共和国九百六十万平方公里上面的劳动人民，现在真正开始统治这块地方了。”国家的权力，一旦掌握在有组织有领导的站立起来了的人民手里，就发挥出巨大无敌的力量，就有可能创造大量的物质财富，结束人民的悲惨的、时虞匮乏的生活，就能使国家和社会飞跃进步。1949年9月29日，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议制定了一个“共同纲领”。这个“共同纲领”起了临时宪法的作用。“共同纲领”序言指出：“中国人民由被压迫的地位变成为新社会新国家的主人，而以人民民主专政的共和国代替那封建买办法西斯专政的国民党反动统治。中国人民民主专政是中国工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子的人民民主统一战线的政权，而以工农联盟为基础，以工人阶级为领导。”1954年9月20日，第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议庄严地通过了“中华人民共和国宪法”。“宪法”规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”“共同纲领”以及在“共同纲领”基础上发展起来的“中华人民共和国宪法”，从根本上将我们国家的国体和政体肯定了下来，这就使我国在极广泛的范围内结束了人民无权的状态，发扬了高度的民主主义。“中华人民共和国宪法”指出：“通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会”，这就解决了我国近代历史中人们长期争论的一个根本问题——中国的出路问题。走社会主义道路，这是唯一正确的道路，一切企图扭转历史巨轮的开倒车的想法和作法，都背离了中国人民的根本利益，必将为中国人民所唾弃和反对。
    在中国共产党领导下，十年来，中国人民依靠人民民主专政的政权，依靠最广泛、最充分地发动起来了的人民群众的力量，把资产阶级民主主义革命遗留下来的任务彻底地胜利地完成了。我们进行了清匪反霸的斗争，把骑在人民头上作威作福的“东霸天”“西霸天”之类的蠹物清除了。我们进行了土地改革运动，把几千年来中国穷困落后的根源——封建剥削制度消灭了。我们在厂矿企业进行了民主改革运动，把束缚社会生产力的旧的规章制度废除和修改了。我们进行了镇压反革命运动，把潜藏的反革命分子和特务分子基本肃清了。我们把几十个兄弟民族，尊重它们的历史，成立了自治区、州、县等，平等地有效地发展了它们的经济文化，把它们团结得坚如磐石。当年青的中华人民共和国建国刚刚一年的时候，凶恶的美帝国主义发动了对朝鲜的军事侵略。美国侵略军进逼鸭绿江边，严重威胁我国的安全。中国人民高举“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的义旗，组织了强大的中国人民志愿军，“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江”，和朝鲜人民军一道，痛击美国的现代化军队。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜经过了两年零九个月的胜利战斗，挫败了美国的侵略计划，迫使美国侵略者在朝鲜停战协定上签字。“美国无敌”的神话从此破灭了，美国纸老虎的外强中干的本质在全世界人民面前暴露无遗了。在彻底地、胜利地完成了资产阶级民主革命之后，我国人民又进行了并正在继续进行着社会主义革命。我们进行了伟大的三反五反运动，粉碎了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。1956年，我国基本上完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业在生产资料私有制方面的社会主义改造。一亿二千万农户和六百多万个手工业者的个体经济变为集体经济；七万户的私营工业企业变为公私合营企业；将近二百万户的私营大中小商店，变为公私合营商店、合作商店、合作小组或者直接变为国营商店。几千年来的生产资料私有制，变为社会主义的公有制，这是一个伟大的社会主义革命。1957年，我们进行了全民整风和反右派斗争，取得了政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利。社会主义革命现时还在继续深入向前发展，可以肯定地预料，它将进一步地调整和变革我国社会主义制度下的生产关系，进一步地解放劳动人民的思想，进一步地提高全民的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，进一步地解放蕴藏在我国社会和我国劳动人民当中的永不枯竭、无穷无尽的社会生产力，使我国的社会主义建设事业出现跃进更跃进的日新月异的局面。
    我国的社会主义建设是和社会主义革命同时进行的。我们一方面在革人与人之间的社会关系的命，另一方面又在革人与自然界之间的关系的命。1953年以前，我们胜利地进行了医治战争创伤、恢复国民经济的艰巨工作。从1953年开始，我们进行了一个规模宏伟的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，这个计划在1957年已经胜利完成和超额完成。在1957年经济战线、思想战线、政治战线所取得的胜利的基础上，在中国共产党制定的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的照耀下，我国人民破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，以冲天的干劲和锐意革新的精神，从事忘我的紧张愉快的劳动，创造了史无前例的国民经济的全民大跃进。1958年的粮食实际收获量为五千亿斤，比1957年增长35％。1958年的棉花实际收获量为四千二百万担，比1957年增长28％。第一个五年计划期间，我国钢的产量总共增加了四百万吨（从1952年的一百三十五万吨至1957年的五百三十五万吨），平均每年净增八十万吨，平均每年增长的速度是31.7％。1958年我国“洋钢”产量就达到八百万吨，比1957年增长49.5％。1958年，我国煤炭产量为二点七亿吨，比1957年增长一倍以上。1958年，我国人民生活水平比1957年提高6.7％，其中农民提高了9.7％。1959年，一个新的大跃进高潮已经形成，中国共产党八届八中全会发出了伟大的战斗号召：在今年内，在工农业主要产品方面，提前完成原定第二个五年计划最后一年（1962年）完成的主要指标。全国人民在这个伟大号召的鼓舞下，在总路线的照耀下，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，举起大跃进的红旗，正在大步前进，实现1959年的新的更大跃进。
    当我们简略地对比了一下新旧两个时代、新旧两个中国的情况之后，当我们简略地回顾了一下十年来新中国的光辉灿烂、气象万千的成就以后，我们怀着革命乐观主义的心情，瞻望将来，感到十分兴奋。我们的心里，充满了对昨天的自豪和对明天的自信。十年前，中国共产党七届二中全会决议曾经指出：“中国的经济遗产是落后的，但是中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民革命的胜利和人民共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导权，加上世界各国无产阶级的援助，其中主要是苏联的援助，中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。对于中国经济复兴的悲观论点，没有任何的根据。”中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的科学预见，已经为十年来的历史事实所证明，还将为未来的事实所继续证明。中国人民如饥如渴地要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的面貌，争取在几个五年计划之后，把自己的国家建设成为一个繁荣的、幸福的、强大的社会主义国家。为这种崇高理想所武装起来的全中国人民，必将从一个胜利走向一个胜利。一切困难吓不倒我们。国内外一切反动势力的攻击，不能停止我们前进的脚步。
          （三）
    在1958年的大跃进当中，一种新的社会组织形式——人民公社——在亚洲的中国出现了。紧接着，一场全民大炼钢铁的伟大战斗开始了。这两个伟大的革命群众运动，都取得了十分伟大的成绩：全中国一亿二千万农户，组织成为二万六千多个规模大、政社合一、工农商学兵相结合、农林牧副渔综合发展的人民公社；全中国大中小城市的工矿企业和交通运输战线上的职工、九千万农民投入了全民炼钢的热潮，使1958年的钢产量猛翻到一千一百零八万吨（包括适合制农具的土钢三百万吨在内），比1957年增长一倍以上。
    对于这两个伟大的革命群众运动，人们曾经有过一些议论。我们并不害怕议论，毛主席说过，“人多，议论多，热气高”，这的确是好事。问题是：这些议论来自国内外的反动的敌对势力，他们“攻其一点，不及其余”，他们对辉煌的成就熟视无睹，抱着猎奇夺异的古怪心情，挖空心思来寻找缺点，并且把这两个伟大的革命群众运动描绘得“漆黑一团”。我们认为，从客观效果来看，对革命群众运动大泼冷水，大泄干劲，如同对中国人民在大跃进中的伟大创造滥施诽谤和诬蔑一样，都是为反动派效劳，都是一样的罪恶。因此，我们有必要回击他们，才能长革命群众的志气，灭国内外敌对势力的威风。
    人民公社化运动要“斩断千年私有根”，全民大炼钢铁运动要使我们国家工业化的计划大大提前实现，一切的革命群众运动要使我们国家兴隆昌盛、日臻富强，这就必然使国外帝国主义分子心惊肉跳，对我们进行愚蠢的诽谤；这也就必然激起国内反动的资产阶级势力的发自阶级本能的反抗。我们满腔热情地关心、爱护、支持、培育一切新生事物的萌芽，我们满腔热情地欢呼所有的革命群众运动，而我们的国内外的敌对势力，对此却抱着深恶痛绝的态度。感情的色彩如此鲜明，这不能不使我们得出结论：凡是敌人“恶之欲其死”的东西，我们一定要“爱之欲其生”；凡是敌人横加诽谤、诬蔑的事物，就是我们人民群众共同的利益所在，我们就一定要立志做下去，一往无前地做下去，不做到完全成功不止。
    人民公社是有生命力的东西，是大跃进的产物，是历史发展的方向，是人民群众的伟大创造。它的优越性已在去年大炼钢铁、秋收秋种、今年春收春种、夏收秋播、夏秋抗旱斗争中大大显示出来，它正在循着巩固、健全的道路向前发展。人民公社不仅是个能够群策群力与自然作斗争的伟大力量，而且是农民从集体所有制转变为全民所有制，从社会主义转变为共产主义的良好基础。全民大炼钢铁增加了国家财富，探明了全国地质资源，培养了大批技术人材，锻炼了人们的思想，是大有所得，毫无所失。国内外敌对势力想在这两个问题上做文章，只是使我们又一次有机会认识到这是徒然心劳日拙的丑恶行为，而愈益增长我们的革命干劲而已。
    在庆祝光辉和伟大的十年的时候，让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
