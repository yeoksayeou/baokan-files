Chairman Liu Shaoqi's Speech

Respected Comrade Chairman Dobi, Dear Hungarian Guests, Comrades, and Friends:

Comrade Dobi came to our country this time, both as the head of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation and as the Chairman of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic. He participated in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country and paid cordial visits to various parts of our country, leaving a deep impression on the Chinese people. Today, Comrade Dobi has returned to Beijing after visiting various parts of our country. We are here to once again warmly welcome Comrade Dobi to visit our country.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers's Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the Hungarian people have made great achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. Today's Hungary is stronger and more prosperous than ever before. The Chinese people are infinitely delighted and encouraged by this. Recently, the Hungarian Socialist Workers's Party put forward a great call to the Hungarian people to accelerate socialist construction. We believe that the heroic and hardworking Hungarian people will surely be able to achieve even more outstanding and greater achievements in their creative labor.

The Hungarian People's Republic is a loyal member of the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Hungarian Socialist Workers's Party has waged a resolute struggle against modern revisionism in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to maintain the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. The Hungarian government and people have made great contributions to easing international tensions, safeguarding world peace, and developing friendship with the people of all countries. The Chinese people highly appreciate these efforts of the Hungarian people.

China and Hungary are fraternal countries closely linked by the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. In the past ten years, our two countries have established extensive relations of mutual assistance and cooperation, which have been fixed by the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in May this year. The friendly visit of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation and Comrade Dobi once again vividly demonstrates the ever-growing close friendship between the people of our two countries.

The people of China and Hungary are both confidently building their own countries. The current international situation is further developing in a favorable direction for peace, democracy, and socialism. Although the reactionary group headed by U.S. imperialism is still trying its best to carry out cold war and conspiracy activities all over the world, creating tensions, their sinister conspiracies will inevitably suffer shameful failures as in the past in the face of the great unity of the people of socialist countries and the great unity of the people of all countries in the world. Our just cause will surely achieve final victory.

Comrades and friends, please raise your glasses,

    For the prosperity of the Hungarian People's Republic,
    For the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of China and Hungary,
    For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For world peace,
    For the health of Comrade Kádár, Comrade Münnich, and other Hungarian Party and Government leaders,
    For the health of Comrade Dobi, cheers!

Chairman Dobi's Speech

Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Dear Comrades and Friends:

We are very happy to have stayed in China for nearly a month at the invitation of Comrade Chairman. Allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you on behalf of all of us.

This month will be a time of rich experience that we will be happy to recall often in the future. Wherever we went, we received cordial and friendly receptions. While making our stay here enjoyable, Chinese comrades did everything possible to allow us to see their daily lives and work. They talked very modestly about their creations and achievements, even the most outstanding ones. In order to be able to work better in the future, they often solicit our opinions. Our stay here is short, and it is difficult for us to talk about deep opinions, but if you allow me, I would like to briefly talk about our impressions.

Everywhere we felt, heard, and saw that the Chinese working people are working tirelessly with great enthusiasm and a high degree of consciousness to carry out socialist construction. In order to enable China to enter the ranks of the world's most advanced countries in industry in a relatively short period of time, pioneering work is being carried out in many new factories. Abundant natural resources, the hard work of the people, and the close cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union make this possible. In order to eliminate the backwardness of Chinese agriculture, the farmers of the People's Commune united to launch a struggle to overcome natural disasters and have already achieved world-renowned achievements. The scale of your construction is astonishing, especially in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, and other places we have visited.

We clearly see that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are successfully realizing and overfulfilling the magnificent plans they have put forward. The foreign policy of the People's Republic of China is also to realize this task. In accordance with the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the Chinese people have always unswervingly strived to develop friendly relations between the people of all countries. At the same time, they are always ready to defend the fruits of their peaceful construction work, oppose any enemy's attacks, and most resolutely oppose all interventionist conspiracies planned by imperialism. In implementing this policy, the Chinese people can always count on the support of the socialist camp and all progressive mankind.

We thank you once again for your friendly reception and sincerely wish you greater success in your outstanding work for the prosperity and happiness of the Chinese people and the safeguarding of peace. Please allow me,

    For the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Hungary,
    For the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the People's Republic of China and its leading force, the Communist Party of China,
    For the health of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi,
    For world peace, cheers!

    朱德委员长、周恩来总理等国家领导人，都出席今晚的宴会作陪。
    刘少奇主席首先在宴会上致词欢迎贵宾。
    道比主席在热烈的掌声中发表了充满友谊激情的讲话。
    刘少奇主席和道比主席的讲话，激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。他们讲话以后，乐队分别高奏匈中两国国歌。
    周恩来总理在宴会上举杯致词，祝贺中匈两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊进一步发展。
    出席今晚宴会作陪的，还有国务院副总理陈毅、谭震林，人大常委会副委员长沈钧儒、彭真，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，外交部副部长章汉夫、曾涌泉，中央国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领和北京市的负责人。
    匈牙利驻中国大使诺格拉第和各国驻华使节，应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会在热烈的友好气氛中进行了两个多小时。
    刘少奇主席的讲话尊敬的道比主席同志，亲爱的匈牙利贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    道比同志这次来到我国，先后以匈牙利党政代表团团长和匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席的名义，参加了我国建国十周年的庆祝大典，并且到我国各地进行了亲切的访问，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。今天，道比同志在我国各地访问之后又回到北京。我们在这里再一次对道比同志来我国访问表示热烈的欢迎。
    近年来，匈牙利人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了巨大的成就。今天的匈牙利要比过去任何时候都更加坚强和繁荣。中国人民对此感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。最近匈牙利社会主义工人党向匈牙利人民提出了加速社会主义建设的伟大号召。我们相信，英勇勤劳的匈牙利人民在自己的创造性劳动中，一定能够取得更加出色、更加伟大的成就。
    匈牙利人民共和国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中的忠实成员。匈牙利社会主义工人党为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为维护社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，同现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。匈牙利政府和人民在和缓国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平，以及发展同各国人民的友谊方面作出了巨大的贡献。中国人民对匈牙利人民的这些努力给予崇高的评价。
    中匈两国是由马克思列宁主义的思想和无产阶级国际主义的原则紧密联结在一起的兄弟国家。在过去十年中，我们两国已经建立了广泛的互助合作关系，这种关系已被今年5月签订的中匈友好合作条约固定下来。这次匈牙利党政代表团和道比同志的友好访问，再一次生动地表现了我们两国人民之间日益发展的亲密友谊。
    中匈两国人民都正在满怀信心地建设着自己的国家。目前国际形势正在进一步朝着有利于和平、民主和社会主义的方向发展。尽管以美帝国主义为首的反动集团还在千方百计地在世界各地进行冷战和阴谋活动，制造紧张局势，但是，在社会主义各国人民的伟大团结的面前，在世界各国人民的伟大团结的面前，他们的罪恶阴谋必将同过去一样遭到可耻的失败。我们的正义事业必将取得最后的胜利。
    同志们，朋友们，请大家举杯，
    为匈牙利人民共和国的繁荣昌盛，
    为中匈两国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为卡达尔同志、明尼赫同志和其他匈牙利党政领导人的健康，
    为道比同志的健康，干杯！
　　道比主席的讲话亲爱的刘少奇同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们应主席同志的邀请在中国逗留了将近一个月，这使我们感到非常高兴。请允许我代表我们大家向你表示衷心的感谢。
    这一个月将是我们今后愿意常常回忆的一段富有经历的时间。无论我们走到那里，我们都受到亲切的、友好的接待。中国同志们在使我们在这里过得愉快的同时，尽一切努力让我们能够看到他们的日常生活和工作。他们对于自己的创造和成就，即使是最出色的创造和成就，也谈得很谦虚。为了以后能够工作得更好，他们常常征求我们的意见。我们在这里逗留的时间很短，要我们来谈很深刻的意见是有困难的，但是如果你们允许的话，我愿意简单地来谈一下我们的印象。
    我们到处都感到、听到和看到中国劳动人民正在以巨大的热情和高度的自觉性，不知疲倦地进行着社会主义建设。为了使中国能够在比较短的时间内，在工业上进入世界最先进的国家的行列中去，在许多新的工厂里正在进行着开路先锋的工作。富饶的自然资源、人民的勤劳以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的密切合作使这一点有可能做到。人民公社的农民为了消除中国农业的落后状态，团结在一起，展开了战胜自然灾害的斗争，并且已经取得了举世闻名的成就。你们的建设规模之大是惊人的，特别是在北京、上海、西安、武汉以及我们到过的其他地方。
    我们很清楚地看到，中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正在成功地实现，并且超额完成自己所提出的宏伟的计划。中华人民共和国的外交政策也是为了实现这个任务。中国人民本着著名的和平共处五项原则始终不渝地为发展各国人民的友好关系而努力。同时，随时准备着保卫自己的和平建设工作的成果，反对敌人的任何进攻，并且最坚决地反对帝国主义所策划的一切干涉阴谋。中国人民在执行这个政策中永远可以指望社会主义阵营和全体进步人类的支持。
    我们再一次感谢你们的友好接待，并且衷心地祝你们在为中国人民的繁荣、幸福以及保卫和平的卓越工作中取得更大的成就。请允许我，
    为中匈两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结，
    为中华人民共和国及其领导力量中国共产党，
    为毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志的健康，
    为世界和平，干杯！（附图片）
