Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Su Changfu, a driver from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps who set a national record of 500,000 kilometers without major overhaul, stated on the eve of the "National Congress of Heroes" that he would respond to the Party's call for increased production and economy, make another leap forward, and strive to achieve 600,000 kilometers of safe and economical driving without major overhaul by 1960.

Since July 1951, when he started driving a GAZ-51 (JIS-150) truck, Su Changfu has driven over 500,000 kilometers without any accidents or major overhauls. Over the past eight years, he has completed over 1,680,000 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks, saving 23 sets of tires, over 5,800 kilograms of gasoline, and turning over 180,000 yuan in profits. He has attended the advanced producer representative meetings of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region multiple times and has been awarded the titles of "Outstanding Communist Party Member" and "Special-Grade Labor Model" by the Corps' Party Committee. In 1958, the Likhachev Automobile Plant in the Soviet Union awarded him a certificate of honor and a prize to commend him for setting a new record for extending the time between major overhauls for GAZ-51 trucks.

Su Changfu's ability to achieve such outstanding results is due to his enthusiasm for the cause of socialist construction under the education of the Party. He often says, "Not cherishing the vehicle will not only fail to maximize its effectiveness but will also damage it and shorten its lifespan, which is a loss to the country." For eight years, he has adhered to the maintenance system every day, not only checking the vehicle before starting, stopping, or returning to the team, but also checking every 30 to 50 kilometers along the way. His ears are always listening to the sounds of the components, and if he hears anything unusual, he will crawl under the vehicle to check it, whether on snow or in the Gobi Desert, and tighten even a loose screw before continuing. He says, "A vehicle is like clothing; if you don't fix a small hole, it will become a big tear." When driving an empty vehicle, he uses ropes to tie the cargo box to the frame to prevent the box from shaking. When a loaded vehicle stops, he uses wooden blocks to prop up the rear of the vehicle. When loading the vehicle, he always stays nearby to supervise and guide the workers to load the goods evenly. When the vehicle is being repaired, he always stays with the vehicle and the repairmen to familiarize himself with the parts, making it easier to maintain. Therefore, the body of the vehicle he drives still has like-new paint, the engines and chassis are in excellent condition, the tools are complete and intact, and the entire vehicle does not lack even a small screw.

Su Changfu strictly abides by traffic regulations. Every time he drives, he is as vigilant as a soldier going to the battlefield, always alert to accidents. In the cab, he always pays attention to pedestrians, vehicles, and horses, never driving "absentmindedly." If he feels tired, he stops immediately to rest before continuing. He says that accidents often occur due to negligence and violations of traffic regulations. On the road, he always "rather stop for a minute than rush for a second," proactively yielding to other vehicles and never cutting in front. In eight years, he has not had any accidents, large or small. Some people say, "If you stand by the river long enough, you're bound to get your shoes wet." He criticized these people's views, saying: Vehicles and materials are the property of the people. The people entrust them to me because they trust me, and I must be responsible to the end and never cause losses due to negligence.

In his work, Su Changfu is a person who never bargains when accepting tasks and leads by example when encountering difficulties. During the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year, he transported ore and coke in the Tianshan Mountains, often getting up at four in the morning to cross ice slopes and steep cliffs 4,000 meters high, and returning late at night. When he saw that the tents were full, he preferred to sleep in the open air. The materials he transported were all intact, and there were never any losses or damages.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Many automobile transportation units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are learning from Su Changfu's advanced experience, extending the interval mileage between major overhauls, saving fuel and tires, ensuring safe driving, and striving to complete this year's transportation tasks ahead of schedule and above quota.

Recently, a certain automobile unit in the Beijing area launched a surge to study Su Changfu, catch up with Su Changfu, and strive for new achievements. The drivers, taking Su Changfu as an example, have set out leap forward plans and strengthened vehicle maintenance. In the past, cadres rarely took action, but now cadres take the lead in repairing vehicles, and they also personally check the vehicles before each trip. Some drivers who only cared about driving in the past and did not pay attention to maintenance now inspect and repair vehicles whenever they have free time. Many vehicles have achieved iron without rust and wood without mud, eliminating accidents, greatly extending the service life of vehicles, and saving more than 600 kilograms of fuel while completing more than 34,000 kilometers of transportation tasks ahead of schedule.

### 争取创造六十万公里无大修新纪录  苏长福决心再跃进  汽车部队司机纷纷学习苏长福经验

    争取创造六十万公里无大修新纪录
    苏长福决心再跃进
    汽车部队司机纷纷学习苏长福经验
    据新华社20日讯　创造行车五十万公里无大修全国最高纪录的新疆生产建设兵团汽车驾驶员苏长福，在“群英会”前夕表示，响应党的增产节约号召，跃进再跃进，争取到1960年安全、节约六十万公里无大修。
    苏长福从1951年7月驾驶吉斯——一五零型汽车起，行驶了五十多万公里，既没有发生事故，也没有经过大修。八年来，他完成了一百六十八万多吨公里的运输任务，并节约轮胎二十三套，汽油五千八百多公斤，上缴利润十八万元。他多次出席了新疆生产建设兵团和新疆维吾尔自治区先进生产者代表会议，并获得兵团党委授予的“优秀共产党员”和“特级劳动模范”的称号。1958年，苏联里哈乔夫汽车制造厂，为了表彰他创造吉斯——一五零型汽车延长大修间隔里程的新纪录，授给他荣誉证书和奖品。
    苏长福能够创造出这样优异成绩，是他在党的教育下，对社会主义建设事业充满了热情。他常说：“不爱护车，不仅不能发挥它的效能，而且会使它损坏以至缩短寿命，这对国家是一个损失。”他八年如一日，每天都坚持保养制度，不仅做到出车、停车或回队检查，途中每隔三、五十里都检查一次。他的两耳随时都注意机件的响声，遇有音障，不论在雪地上或戈壁滩，都要爬到车底检查，那怕是一个螺丝松了也要拧紧再走。他说：“车子如衣服，小洞不补，大洞一尺五”。他在空车行驶时，用绳子将车箱与大梁捆紧，防止车箱震动。载重车停下时，他用木棒将车子后部顶起。装车时，他一向在旁照应，指导工人把货装匀。车子修理时，他都跟着车子和修理工一起干，熟悉机件，便于保养。因此他驾驶的汽车车身至今油漆如新，发动机和底盘两大系的机器都很好，随车工具完整无缺，全车连一个小螺丝也不缺。
    苏长福非常遵守交通规则。他每次出车，都像战士上战场一样，时时刻刻警惕事故，在驾驶室里他随时注意行人、车马，从不开“迷糊车”，自己觉得有些疲倦赶快停下来，休息一下再走。他说，事故的发生常常是因为疏忽大意，违犯了交通规则。路上他还总是“宁停一分，不抢一秒”，主动让车，从不抢先。八年来他没有发生大小事故。有人说：“常在河边站，那会不湿鞋”，他批判了这些人的看法，他说：车辆和物资是人民的财产，人民交给自己是信任自己，自己要负责到底，决不能因疏忽大意而造成损失。
    在工作中，苏长福是一个接受任务从不讲价钱、遇到困难以身作则的人。去年大炼钢铁时，他在天山山区运矿石、焦炭，经常是早晨四时起床，翻越四千米高的冰坡陡壁，深夜才回来，看到帐篷住满了人，自己宁愿睡在露天。他所运的物资都完好无损，从未发生过遗失和损伤。
    据新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军许多汽车运输部队，纷纷学习苏长福的先进经验，延长汽车大修间隔里程，节约油料、轮胎，保证安全行车，力争提前和超额完成今年的运输任务。
    北京地区某汽车部队最近掀起了一个学苏长福、赶苏长福、力争新成绩的热潮。驾驶员们以苏长福为榜样订出跃进计划，加强了车辆的保养工作。过去干部动手少，现在干部带头修车，每次出车也都亲自检查。有些过去只管开车，不注意保养的驾驶员，也都一有空就检修。许多车辆做到了铁无锈、木无泥，杜绝了事故，大大延长了车辆使用年限，并在提前完成三万四千多公里的运输任务中，节约油料六百多公斤。
