    Our Newspaper Reports: Shanxi Heshun County has vigorously developed sideline production. This year, sideline income reached more than 770,000 yuan, an increase of 3.69 times compared with the same period last year.
    The great development of sideline production in Heshun County has not been smooth sailing. Some leading comrades, especially at the grassroots level, previously had serious ideas of neglecting sideline occupations, generally using the excuse that farm work was busy and there was no time for sideline occupations. In response to these ideas, Party committees at all levels adopted the method of "debate, compare, calculate, and see" to unify the understanding of leaders. It is a fact that farm work is busy, but can sideline production be taken care of at the same time? The cadres of various communes adopted the methods of "excavating, managing, reforming, and making breakthroughs" to find a large amount of labor. "Excavating" means fully organizing women, family members of staff and workers, cadres, the elderly, and feeders who can participate in production and invest them in sideline production; "managing" means promoting the contracting method and strengthening labor management to improve labor efficiency; "reforming" means actively reforming tools; and finally, seizing the production season, making the most of every moment, and launching a large-scale sideline production shock movement. Through the above measures, Li Yang Commune alone can extract more than 1,000 laborers (accounting for 17.2% of the total labor force) to specialize in sideline production. Some people think that there is "no way" to engage in sideline occupations, but this commune found 50 production opportunities at one time, with an annual income of 410,000 yuan, an average income of 98 yuan per household.
    In the debate, various communes also conducted comparative education with units that did well in sideline occupations and those that did not. For example, Xinzhuang suffered disasters almost every year after liberation, but due to the vigorous development of sideline production, the income of the masses increased year by year; while Pingdichuan Village, which had better conditions, did not increase the income of its members much in recent years due to neglecting sideline production, and 81 households in the village owed national loans. These facts eloquently educated the cadres and the masses, making them realize that while vigorously developing grain production, taking out a certain amount of strength to develop sideline production is the only way to quickly change from poverty to wealth. The Heshun County Party Committee also held on-site meetings in communes with good sideline production to promote the experience of these communes in developing sideline production.
    Developing sideline production must also mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast number of members. Because some members were unclear about the scope of collective and individual operations, income distribution, and price policies, Party committees at all levels conducted publicity among the masses based on national policies. Livestock that had been taken into collective ownership were paid for at appraised prices; private plots were allocated according to regulations; the scope of operations was divided; and it was reiterated that the sideline income of members' individual operations belongs entirely to the individual. These policies greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of members to engage in sideline occupations.
    In developing sideline production, Heshun County also adopted the methods of "one unification" and "six combinations." "One unification" is unified leadership, overall planning, and proper resolution of various contradictions in the development of sideline production. "Six combinations" means that the development of various economies must be combined with national plans; collective production must be combined with individual production; professional teams must be combined with mass shock movements (sideline professional teams account for about 20% of the total labor force); agriculture must be combined with sideline occupations; long-term interests must be combined with current interests; and industry, agriculture, and commerce must be combined. This not only guarantees agricultural production but also grasps sideline production.
    In order to ensure the full development of sideline production, there are special leaders at all levels from the county to the production team, and they have adhered to "six grasps": grasp the plan, implement the plan to the management area and production team, and help members formulate a plan for the development of household sideline occupations; grasp the inspection, check the completion of the plan and contract; seize the season, organize shock production according to the season; grasp the material exchange meeting, open up sales channels; grasp the backward, send cadres to help some areas with poor sideline production; grasp technical guidance, and draw technically skilled cadres from the county to guide production in various communes.
    With the development of sideline production, the economic landscape of Heshun County has undergone tremendous changes, which are manifested in: First, it has strongly supported industrial and agricultural production. Due to the fact that sideline occupations have provided a large amount of raw materials for industry, the total industrial output value of the county has reached 2.25 million yuan, an increase of 2.75 times compared with the same period last year. This year, Heshun County has manufactured more than 800,000 pieces of various agricultural implements, which not only fully meets the needs of agricultural production in the county but also supports other places. The increase in income from sideline production has expanded investment in agricultural production. This year, investment in the purchase of production materials has increased by 38.7% compared with last year. Most management areas can issue wages quarterly and monthly, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of members. Second, the income of the masses has increased and their lives have been improved. The average income per household in the county is 111 yuan, an increase of 3.85 times compared with the same period last year, and the total amount of farmers' savings has reached more than 350,000 yuan. Third, the market economy has been enlivened, and the total purchase amount of agricultural and sideline local specialties in the county has reached 1.29 million yuan, an increase of 1.83 times compared with the same period last year.

    统一思想认识　全面进行规划　及时检查指导
    和顺今年副业收入增三倍
    本报讯　山西和顺县大搞副业生产，今年副业收入达七十七万多元，比去年同期增长了三点六九倍。
    和顺县副业生产的大发展并不是一帆风顺的。在部分领导同志，特别是在基层干部中，原来存在着严重的轻视副业的思想，一般都借口农活忙，没时间搞副业。针对这些思想，各级党委采取了“辩、比、算、看”的方法，统一了领导思想认识。农活忙是事实，但是究竟能不能兼顾副业生产呢？各公社的干部采用“挖、管、改、突”的办法，找到了大量的劳动力。“挖”，就是充分组织能参加生产的妇女、职工家属、干部、老人、饲养员等投入副业生产；“管”，就是推行包工办法，加强劳动管理以提高劳动效率；“改”，就是积极改革工具；最后，便是抓住生产季节，见缝插针，大搞副业突击运动。通过以上几项办法，仅李阳公社就可以抽出一千多个劳动力（占总劳力17.2％），专门从事副业生产。有人认为搞副业“没门路”，但是这个公社一次就找到了五十项生产门路，全年能收入四十一万元，每户平均收入九十八元。
    在辩论中，各公社还以副业搞得较好的和搞得不好的单位进行对比教育。如新庄在解放后几乎连年遭灾，但由于大搞副业生产，群众收入逐年增加；而条件较好的平地川村，由于忽视副业生产，几年来社员收入增加不多，全村有八十一户欠了国家贷款。这些事实，雄辩地教育了干部和群众，使他们认识到在大力发展粮食生产的同时，拿出一定力量发展副业生产是迅速由贫变富必由之路。和顺县委还在副业生产搞得好的公社召开了现场会议，推广这些公社开展副业生产的经验。
    开展副业生产还必须调动广大社员的生产积极性。由于部分社员对集体与个人的经营范围，收益分配，价格政策等问题认识不清，各级党委都根据国家政策在群众中进行了宣传，凡已经收归队养的家畜进行了作价付款；按规定拨给自留地；划分了经营范围；重申社员个人经营的副业收入完全归个人所有。这些政策大大鼓舞了社员经营副业的积极性。
    在开展副业生产上，和顺县还采取了“一统”、“六结合”的方法。“一统”就是统一领导，全面规划，妥善地解决发展副业生产中的各种矛盾。“六结合”就是发展各种经济必须与国家计划相结合；集体生产与个人生产相结合；专业队和全民突击相结合（副业专业队占总劳力的20％左右）；农业与副业相结合；长远利益和当前利益相结合；工、农、商相结合。这样既保证了农业生产，也抓住了副业生产。
    为了保证副业生产得到充分的发展，从县到生产队层层有专人领导，并坚持了“六抓”：抓计划，把计划落实到管理区、生产队，并帮助社员制定了发展家庭副业计划；抓检查，检查计划和合同的完成情况；抓季节，按季节组织突击生产；抓物资交流会，畅通销路；抓落后，对一些副业生产搞得较差的地区，派干部帮助；抓技术指导，全县抽有技术的干部分别到各公社指导生产。
    随着副业生产的发展，和顺县的经济面貌已经发生了巨大的变化，这表现在：第一，有力地支援了工农业生产。由于副业给工业提供了大量的原料，使全县工业总产值达到二百二十五万元，比去年同期增长二点七五倍。今年和顺县自制各种农具八十多万件，不但充分满足了本县农业生产的需要，还支援了外地。副业生产的收入增加，扩大了农业生产的投资，今年购买生产资料的投资比去年增加了38.7％。大部管理区能按季按月发放工资，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。第二，群众收入增多，生活得到改善。全县每户平均收入一百一十一元，比去年同期增加三点八五倍，农民的储蓄总额达三十五万多元。第三，活跃了市场经济，全县农副土特产品收购总额已达一百二十九万元，比去年同期增长了一点八三倍。
