Carefully Play Each Move, Strive for Total Victory
    Shu Jia

    Those who play chess must try their best to play each move well, because they know that one wrong move can lose the entire game. The same is true in agricultural production. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is an interconnected whole. Each "character" must be implemented well in order to achieve substantial increases in production. "Sowing, managing, and harvesting" also form a whole. Neglecting any one link will affect the harvest. The experience of this year's summer harvest powerfully proves this point. This year's summer crops were not only of high sowing quality, but also tightly managed in the fields, and attention was paid to the quality of harvesting and threshing. Therefore, despite suffering from severe droughts and floods, a good harvest was still achieved.

    The quality of this year's autumn sowing is generally better than last year, and the seedlings in some fields that have already emerged are neat, uniform, and robust. This can be said to be sowing well. After sowing well, it is also necessary to manage well. After sowing, field management should be immediately grasped tightly to play the second move well. Taking winter wheat as an example, good management before winter, with sufficient fertilizer and water, can make the wheat seedlings strong, deeply rooted, and produce more tillers. Strong seedlings and deep roots can enhance the wheat seedlings' ability to resist frost and pests, and reduce the possibility of the appearance of third-class seedlings, creating favorable conditions for next year's high wheat yield. However, some areas have become complacent because of good sowing and have relaxed field management. This is detrimental to striving for a bumper summer harvest next year. We must immediately grasp field management after sowing well, and use our greatest efforts to first protect the summer crops to survive the winter well. From the entire growth process of crops, sowing well is the first move in striving for a bumper harvest; from the field management process, winter field management is the first move in the entire field management. Grasp the first move, play the first move well, and then there are the second, third moves..., each move must be played well, not letting go of any move, in order to achieve total victory. If, after playing the first move well, one becomes complacent and no longer diligently and attentively continues to work hard, then even if the desire to strive for total victory is strong, it will still be impossible to achieve the goal. Therefore, maintaining a full spirit at all times, without arrogance or impetuosity, and working hard in a down-to-earth manner is of great significance for striving for total victory.

    Whether or not each link can be tightly linked, each move played well, and victory achieved in the entire game, depends on whether the leadership has a spirit of continuous revolution. This can be clearly seen from the news from Yancheng County published in today's newspaper. The Yancheng County Party Committee immediately put forward the slogan "Sow wherever you manage, manage well from the beginning, manage to the end" before the autumn sowing was even finished, and grasped field management tightly, determined to play the second and third moves well. Because the Yancheng County Party Committee leadership was full of energy and did not slack off, the masses also followed up with high morale and full of energy, and put forward more than 100,000 suggestions, not only offering advice for the winter management of summer crops, but also proposing ten basic measures for the entire field management of summer crops. Subsequently, a mass movement to vigorously accumulate fertilizer and carry out high-standard field management of summer crops was launched. The facts in Yancheng County fully demonstrate that it is very important to establish the idea of "not letting go of any move, playing each move well, and striving for total victory in the entire game" among cadres and the masses. With this idea, followed immediately by action, there is great confidence in a bumper summer harvest next year.

    着着走好　争取全胜
    蜀嘉
    会下棋的人，在走每一着棋的时候，都要想方设法走好，因为他们深知一着棋不对，就可能输了满盘棋。在农业生产上也是如此，农业“八字宪法”是一个互相关联的整体，每一个“字”都必须贯彻得很好，才能够大量增产；“种、管、收”也是一个整体，忽略了任何一环，都会影响到收成的。今年夏季丰收的经验，十分有力地证明了这一点。今年夏熟作物不但播种质量高，而且田间管理工作抓得紧，收获时又注意了收打质量，因此在遭受了严重水旱灾害的情况下，还是得到了丰收。
    今年秋播的质量，普遍比去年还好，一部分已出苗的田，幼苗整齐均匀、茁壮。这可以说是种得好。种好了，还需要管好。在播种之后应该立即抓紧田间管理，走好第二着棋。以冬小麦来说，冬前管理得好，肥、水充足，就能使小麦苗壮、根深、分蘖多；苗壮、根深就可以增强麦苗抵抗冻害、虫害的能力，减少三类苗出现的可能性，为明年小麦高产创造良好条件。但是，有些地区因为种得好而产生了自满情绪，放松了田间管理。这对争取明年夏熟大丰收是不利的。我们一定要在种好之后，立即抓住田间管理，用最大的努力，首先保护夏熟作物过好越冬关。从作物的整个生长过程来说，种好是争取丰收的第一着；从田间管理过程来说，冬季田间管理又是整个田间管理的第一着。抓住了第一着，走好了第一着，紧接着的还有第二、第三着……，必须着着走好，一着不让，才能获得全胜。如果在走好了第一着棋以后就沾沾自喜，不再兢兢业业、专心致志地继续努力，那末，即使争取全胜的愿望很强烈，也仍然不可能达到目的。因此，时时刻刻保持饱满的情绪，不骄不躁，踏踏实实地实干苦干，对争取全胜有十分重大的意义。
    能不能环环扣紧，走好每一着棋，获得满盘棋的胜利，关键在于领导有没有不断革命的精神。这一点，从今天本报发表的盐城县的消息就可以看得很清楚。中共盐城县委在秋播还没有结束的时候，就立即提出了“种到哪里，管到哪里，从头管好，一管到底”的口号，抓紧了田间管理，下决心走好第二着、第三着棋。因为盐城县委领导上干劲十足，毫不松懈，群众也就斗志昂扬、干劲十足地跟了上来，提出了十多万条意见，不但对夏熟作物的越冬管理献计献策，而且对夏熟作物的整个田间管理提出了十大基本措施。接着，一个群众性的大搞积肥、大搞夏熟作物高标准田间管理的运动开展起来了。盐城县的事实充分说明，在干部和群众中树立“一着不让、着着走好、争取满盘棋全胜”的思想十分重要。有了这种思想，又立即继之以行动，明年夏季大丰收就大有把握。
