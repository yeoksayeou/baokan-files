The notice stated: After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the broad masses of workers and staff throughout the country enthusiastically responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year. They opposed Right-leaning tendencies, boosted their enthusiasm, and further set off a high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement. We must cherish and care for the labor enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers and staff in every possible way. We should also actively take effective measures to earnestly ensure their safety and health in production, and strive to avoid all preventable casualties, so that the production upsurge that has already formed can be consolidated and continuously developed. The notice requires all regions, departments, and factory and mining enterprises to continue to strengthen the leadership of labor protection work in the increase production and practice economy movement on the basis of the tremendous achievements made in the major safety production inspection this year, to ensure safe production, make proper work and rest arrangements, vigorously carry out technological revolution, and combine hard work with clever work; prevent the practice of simply relying on extending working hours and increasing labor intensity to increase production. At the same time, continue to consolidate and implement various rules and regulations related to safe production, regularly conduct safe production education for workers and staff, organize labor protection training for production management cadres, vigorously launch mass movements, establish safe production red flags, promote advanced experiences, and earnestly resolve major issues left over from the major safe production inspection.

After putting forward specific requirements for preparing for cold protection and warmth preservation, eliminating fire accidents, and strengthening explosion-proof and anti-poisoning work, the notice pointed out:

Caring for the lives of workers and staff, preventing diseases, and ensuring attendance are important parts of winter protection work. The winter climate is dry, and the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is large, which can easily cause colds and affect workers' attendance. In order to reduce such diseases, simple workshops and workers' living rooms should be repaired in a timely manner to repair doors and windows and plug leaks to ensure that they are not drafty or leaky. Field operations and open-air operation units should have places for workers to take breaks and keep warm, and equipment for heating food.

The notice requires all enterprises and institutions to vigorously carry out patriotic health campaigns, and earnestly do a good job in environmental and personal hygiene. Winter sports activities should be widely carried out, and workers and staff should be guaranteed to eat well, sleep well, and rest well, so that they can engage in production healthily and energetically.

    做好冬季劳动保护工作  保证生产高潮不断高涨
    经委建委全总等单位发出联合通知
    据新华社讯　中华人民共和国国家经济委员会、国家基本建设委员会、公安部、劳动部、卫生部和中华全国总工会，在10月20日联合向各省、自治区、直辖市有关部门发出“关于做好冬季劳动保护工作的联合通知”。
    通知说：党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，全国职工群众热烈地响应党中央提出的在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的伟大号召，反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步掀起了增产节约运动的高潮。对于职工群众这种劳动热情和革命干劲，必须百般地珍惜和爱护；并且应该积极采取有效措施，切实保障他们在生产中的安全和健康，力争避免一切可以避免的伤亡事故，使目前已经形成的生产高潮，巩固地、持续不断地发展下去。通知要求各地区、各部门和各厂矿企业单位，在今年安全生产大检查取得巨大成果的基础上，继续加强增产节约运动中劳动保护工作的领导，保证安全生产，做好劳逸安排，大搞技术革命，把苦干与巧干结合起来；防止单纯依靠延长工作时间和增加劳动强度来增产的作法。同时，继续整顿和贯彻有关安全生产的各项规章制度，经常向职工进行安全生产教育，组织对生产管理干部的劳动保护训练，大搞群众运动，树立安全生产红旗，推广先进经验，并且认真解决安全生产大检查所遗留下来的重大问题。
    通知对防寒保暖准备、消灭火灾事故、以及加强防爆防毒工作方面，提出具体要求以后指出：
    关心职工生活、预防疾病、保证出勤，是冬季保护工作中的一项重要内容。冬季气候干燥，室内外温度相差很大，极易引起伤风感冒，从而影响职工出勤。为了减少此类疾病，对简易车间和工人生活用室，应该及时作好修缮门窗和堵塞漏隙的工作，做到不透风不漏雨。野外作业和露天作业单位应该设有供工人间歇取暖的处所和食物加热设备。
    通知要求所有企业单位应该大力开展爱国卫生运动，切实搞好环境卫生和个人卫生。应该广泛开展冬季体育锻炼活动，并且保证职工吃好、睡好和休息好，使他们能够健康地、精力充沛地从事生产。
