Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 30th. The Tongjialiang Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, has made good achievements in serving the workers in the mining area. The Ministry of Commerce recently held a national on-site conference on supply services in industrial and mining areas in Datong City to promote their experience.

The Party organization of the Tongjialiang Store adheres to putting politics in command, educates the store staff to firmly establish the viewpoint of serving production, and launched a competition campaign of "Everything for More Coal Production." Their slogans are: supply whatever the coal mine needs; supply wherever production goes; supply whenever it is needed. All business activities of the store revolve around one center: ensuring that workers live well, rest well, and have plenty of energy to produce more coal. In order to allow workers living in scattered areas to travel less and rest more, the store mobilized family members of employees to organize consignment shops, so that workers could buy oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea as soon as they went out. Workers produce in three shifts day and night, and the store also established a three-shift system, open day and night, so that workers can eat something even at midnight. This store originally only supplied goods. The store staff saw that single workers had difficulty washing clothes, and workers had to travel more than ten miles to get haircuts and repair furniture, which delayed production, so they established service units such as washing and mending departments, barber shops, and repair shops. Salespersons often carry snacks to the working face in the mine. At the beginning of this spring, several thousand workers opened an open-pit mine on Qifeng Mountain, more than ten miles away from the store. At that time, the ground was covered with ice and snow, and the winding paths were as slippery as mirrors. However, the salespersons did not avoid hardships and delivered various goods to the mountain. The workers were very moved and composed a jingle to thank them, saying: The comrades of the store are energetic, pushing carts and carrying burdens, tofu soup and shredded pork noodles, cigarettes, wine, and all kinds of goods are available, eat and drink enough to have strength, and return in triumph to thank the store.

The Tongjialiang Store not only prepares procurement plans according to the needs of coal mine production, but also tries every possible means to organize sources of goods to meet the urgent needs of coal mine production, so as to "send charcoal in the snow." This year, the Tongjialiang Coal Mine urgently needed safety willow hats, but the coal mine material supply department could not find the source of goods anywhere. In addition to sending telegrams, making phone calls, and writing letters to contact other places, the Tongjialiang Store also sent people to more than a dozen counties and cities such as Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Hunyuan to purchase, and bought back a total of 13,500 willow hats. From February to September this year, the store organized 210 kinds of commodities urgently needed for production in this way, which promoted the production of coal mines to a certain extent.

The unity of the mine and the store, mutual disclosure, and unified arrangements have played a decisive role in the store's supply and service work. The Tongjialiang Coal Mine regards the store as a component of the mine and provides support in terms of manpower, equipment, and housing. The store staff also believe that they are members of the coal mine and often take the initiative to report their work and thoughts to the mine's Party committee.

In his concluding speech at the on-site meeting, Cheng Zihua, Minister of Commerce, pointed out that the task of the stores in industrial and mining areas is to comprehensively organize the economic life of the people, and the operating principles of the stores should be: everything for production, supply wherever production goes; supply whatever is needed; supply whenever it is needed. When he talked about the Party's leadership and the mass line in the stores in industrial and mining areas, he said that while accepting the leadership of the Kouquan District Party Committee of Datong City, the Tongjialiang Store took the initiative to report and ask for instructions from the Coal Mine Party Committee, actually forming a dual leadership relationship between the District Committee and the Coal Mine Party Committee over the store's Party branch, and the effect was very good. In terms of implementing the mass line's working methods, the "three participations and one change" of the Tongjialiang Store are well implemented, which is prominently manifested in organizing the family members of employees to supervise and participate in the management of the store's work, which helps to continuously improve the political awareness of the family members of employees, enhance unity and friendship, and is conducive to production. In his speech, he asked all localities to combine the experience of Tongjialiang Store with the advanced experience of commercial work in local industrial and mining areas to promote it.

More than 500 people attended the meeting, including heads of commercial departments of provinces and autonomous regions across the country, heads of commercial departments of key industrial and mining areas and forest areas in various provinces, and representatives of relevant central state agencies. They passed a proposal, advocating that commercial units in various industrial, mining, and forest areas learn from Tongjialiang, catch up with Tongjialiang, and surpass Tongjialiang, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and fully support the continued leap forward in the production of steel, coal, oil, and timber industries.

### 同家梁商店挑起组织矿区人民经济生活的担子  生产到哪里　供应到哪里  商业部大力推广他们一切为生产服务做好供应工作的经验

    同家梁商店挑起组织矿区人民经济生活的担子
    生产到哪里　供应到哪里
    商业部大力推广他们一切为生产服务做好供应工作的经验
    据新华社太原30日电　山西大同市同家梁商店在为矿区职工服务方面做出了良好成绩。商业部最近在大同市召开全国工矿区供应服务现场会议，推广了他们的经验。
    同家梁商店党组织坚持政治挂帅，教育商店工作人员坚定地树立为生产服务的观点，展开了“一切为了多出煤”的竞赛运动。他们的口号是：煤矿需要什么，供应什么；生产到哪里，供应到哪里；什么时候需要，什么时候供应。商店的一切业务活动都围绕着一个中心：保证职工生活好、休息好，精力充沛，多出煤炭。为了使分散居住的工人少跑路，多休息，商店发动职工家属组织代售店，工人一出门就可以买到油盐酱醋茶。工人按三班日夜轮流生产，商店也建立三班制，日夜营业，使工人在午夜也可以吃到东西。这个商店原来只供应商品，商店职工看到单身工人拆洗衣服困难，工人理发、修理家具要跑十几里路，耽误生产，就建立了拆洗缝补门市部、理发店、修理店等服务单位。售货员们还常常背着点心送到井下工作面去。今年初春，有几千名职工在离商店十几里远的七峰山上开露天矿。当时冰雪盖地，羊肠小道上冻的像镜子一样滑。但是，售货员们不避艰辛，把各种商品送上山。工人们十分感动，编出顺口溜感谢说：商店同志干劲大，推着小车担上担，豆腐汤、肉丝面，烟酒百货样样全，吃饱喝足力气大，夺煤凯旋谢商店。
    同家梁商店不仅根据煤矿生产需要编制采购计划，还千方百计地组织货源，满足煤矿生产的迫切需求，做到“雪里送炭”。今年同家梁煤矿急需安全柳条帽，煤矿材料供应部门到处找不到货源。同家梁商店除了拍电报、打电话、写信到外地联系以外，还派人到石家庄、保定、浑源等十几个县市去采购，共买回了柳条帽一万三千五百顶。从今年2月到9月，商店组织这样生产上急需的商品达二百一十种，在一定程度上促进了煤矿的生产。
    矿店一家，互相交底，统一安排，对商店搞好供应服务工作起了决定作用。同家梁煤矿把商店当作矿的一个组成部分，在人力、设备、住房等方面，给予支援。商店人员也认为自己是煤矿的一员，经常主动地向矿党委汇报工作和思想。
    商业部部长程子华在现场会议的总结发言中指出，工矿区商店的任务是全面地组织人民经济生活，商店的经营原则应该是：一切为了生产，生产到哪里，供应到哪里；需要什么，供应什么；什么时候需要，什么时候供应。他在谈到工矿区商店党的领导和群众路线的问题时说，同家梁商店在接受大同市口泉区党委的领导的同时，主动地向煤矿党委汇报和请示工作，实际上形成了区委和矿党委对商店党支部的双重领导关系，这样做的效果很好。在贯彻群众路线的工作方法上，同家梁商店的“三参一改”实行得好，突出地表现在组织职工家属对商店工作进行监督和参加管理方面，这有助于使职工家属的政治觉悟不断提高，增强团结友爱，有利于生产。他在发言中，要求各地把同家梁商店的经验与本地工矿区商业工作的先进经验结合起来推广。
    参加这次会议的有全国各省、自治区商业厅、各省的重点工矿区林区商业部门负责人和有关中央国家机关的代表共五百多人。他们通过一项倡议，倡议各工矿林区的商业单位学同家梁、赶同家梁、超同家梁，大战第四季度，全力支持钢铁、煤炭、石油、木材工业生产的继续跃进。（附图片）
