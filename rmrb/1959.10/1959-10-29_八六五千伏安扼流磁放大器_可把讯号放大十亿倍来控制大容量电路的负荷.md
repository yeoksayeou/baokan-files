    Eight Six Five KVA Saturated Reactor Magnetic Amplifier
    Can Amplify Signals by a Billion Times to Control the Load of High-Capacity Circuits
    (Our Dispatch) China's first self-designed 865 KVA saturated reactor magnetic amplifier has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Pioneer Electric Motor Factory. This significant achievement has opened up new avenues for the widespread application of magnetic amplifiers in automatic adjustment and control systems in the modern motor industry.
    Due to the continuous progress of science and technology, the adjustment and control equipment of many motors and machines currently requires various amplifiers to amplify the input signals to control the load of high-capacity circuits. The multiple between this load and the signal is usually called the amplification factor. A magnetic amplifier is a new type of amplifier with an amplification factor of up to one billion times, capable of controlling DC signals with power as small as 0.0000000000000000001 watts. It is also highly reliable, durable, and can withstand extreme impacts and vibrations. Although its external structure is relatively simple, its principle involves the non-linear circuit problem where voltage and current are disproportionate, making it a complex and cutting-edge technical subject. In the past, it had not been possible to use magnetic amplifiers for controlling aspects like the constant power requirement of carborundum electric furnaces, where the furnace resistance changes.
    At the end of last year, after the Pioneer Electric Motor Factory accepted the task of manufacturing carborundum equipment, a young technician, using the general principles of magnetic amplifiers, proposed using magnetic amplifiers to control the voltage and furnace temperature of the carborundum electric furnace. The factory's Party organization actively supported his suggestion and decided to immediately design and trial-produce it.
    During the trial production process, various difficulties were overcome by convening "Three-Combination Zhuge Liang Meetings" multiple times and concentrating the wisdom of the masses. After evaluation, the finished product was proven to fully meet the requirements.

    八六五千伏安扼流磁放大器
    可把讯号放大十亿倍来控制大容量电路的负荷
    本报讯　我国第一套自行设计的八百六十五千伏安扼流磁放大器，最近在上海先锋电机厂试制成功。这一重大成就，为在现代电机工业的自动调整和控制系统中广泛应用磁放大器开创了新的道路。
    由于科学技术的不断进步，目前许多电机、机械的调整和控制设备都需用各种放大器把输入的讯号放大，以控制大容量电路的负荷。这种负荷与讯号之间的倍数通常就称为放大系数。磁放大器是一种新的放大器，它的放大系数高达十亿倍，控制功率可小到0.0000000000000000001瓦的直流讯号，同时可靠性高，经久耐用，可承受极大的冲击和震动。它的外形结构虽比较简单，而原理则涉及到电压与电流成不正规比例的非线性电路问题，因此是一个繁复而尖端的技术课题。过去一直没有能把磁放大器用于如同金钢砂电炉这一类要求恒定功率的、炉电阻变化的控制方面。
    去年年底，先锋电机厂接下制造金钢砂设备的任务后，一位青年技术人员运用一般磁放大器的原理，提出改用磁放大器来控制金刚砂电炉的电压和炉温的建议。工厂党组织积极支持他的建议，决定立即设计试制。
    试制过程中，经过多次召开“三结合诸葛亮会”等，集中了群众的智慧，克服了各种困难。成品经过鉴定，证明质量完全合乎要求。
