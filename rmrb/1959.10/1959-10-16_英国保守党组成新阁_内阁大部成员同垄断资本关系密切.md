Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th Dispatch: The Conservative Party, which won the British general election on the 9th, has formed a new cabinet, with the list formally announced on the 14th.

Most of the key members of the new cabinet are from the previous cabinet. Harold Macmillan continues as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, Selwyn Lloyd as Foreign Secretary, Heathcoat Amory as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Richard Butler as Home Secretary, and Home as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The retention of the same personnel in these key positions is seen as an indication that the Macmillan government will continue to pursue its basic policies from before the election.

Some of the more significant changes in personnel in the new cabinet are the departure of Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd, replaced by former Minister of Labour and National Service Iain Macleod. This is seen as a step taken by Macmillan to appease public opinion regarding the bankrupt British colonial policies in Africa. The post of Defence Minister has been transferred from Sandys to Harold Watkinson, the former Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. Sandys assumes the newly created position of Minister of Aviation, responsible for developing new weapons such as missiles.

The British weekly magazine "Tribune" published an article entitled "Who Owns Britain?" exposing the relationship between the British government and the upper echelons of the Conservative Party and British monopoly capital. The article pointed out that most of the members of Macmillan's cabinet come from aristocratic families or are major capitalists. Macmillan himself comes from an aristocratic family and served as a director of the former Great Western Railway Company, Automatic Coil Winder and Electrical Equipment Co., and Macmillan Publishers. Lloyd served as a director of Alliance Assurance Company, Heathcoat Amory served as a director of Heathcoat & Co. and Lloyds Bank, Home served as a director of the Bank of Scotland and Scottish Union and National Insurance Company, Butler served as a director of Courtaulds, and Maudling served as a director of Planet Assurance Company and Land Improvement Company.

　　英国保守党组成新阁
    内阁大部成员同垄断资本关系密切
    据新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：在9日的英国大选中获胜的保守党已经组成新内阁，内阁名单在14日正式宣布。
    新内阁的主要成员大部分都是上届内阁的人马。哈罗德·麦克米伦继续担任首相兼首席财政大臣，塞尔温·劳埃德任外交大臣，希思寇特—埃默里任财政大臣，理查德·巴特勒任内政大臣，霍姆任联邦关系大臣。新内阁这几个主要席位由原班人马担任，这一事实被认为说明了麦克米伦政府仍将继续推行它在大选前的基本政策。
    在新内阁中人员有更动的一些较重要的职位是，原殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德去职，由前任劳工和国民兵役大臣伊安·麦克劳德接任。人们认为，这显然是麦克米伦为了敷衍舆论对破产的英国在非洲的殖民政策的指责而采取的一个步骤。国防大臣由前任交通和民用航空大臣哈罗德·沃金森调任，原国防大臣桑迪斯出任新设的航空大臣，并负责发展导弹等新武器。
    英国“论坛”周刊曾经刊载一篇题为“英国属于谁？”的文章，揭露英国政府和保守党上层同英国垄断资本的关系。这篇文章指出，在麦克米伦的内阁中，大部分成员都出身于大贵族家庭或者是大资本家。麦克米伦本人就出身于大贵族家庭，并曾任前大西铁路公司、自动排浇机公司、麦克米伦公司的董事，劳埃德曾任联盟保险公司的董事，希思寇特—埃默里曾任希思寇特公司、劳埃德银行的董事，霍姆曾任苏格兰银行、苏格兰联合和国家保险公司的董事，巴特勒曾任考陶尔德公司董事，莫德林曾任星球保险公司、土地改良公司董事。
