　　Launch a "Ghost Busting" Campaign
　　——Written Before Tales of Not Fearing Ghosts
　　Wang Renzhong
　　There are many stories in history about people who were not afraid of ghosts. Those who are timid might gain some courage from reading these stories. Perhaps some people, after reading ghost stories, will have nightmares. We Communists are materialists and do not believe in ghosts and gods. However, people have heard many ghost stories since childhood, and the fear is still difficult to completely eliminate. This is similar to the psychology of some Chinese people who fear foreign devils. Fear of ghosts and fear of foreigners are both a kind of inferiority complex, a manifestation of slavishness. To change this state of mind, it is very helpful to read stories of not fearing ghosts.
　　Are there ghosts in real life? The kind of ghosts described in books do not exist. But there are many other ghosts that often appear around us. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are all ghosts; bourgeois ideology is also a ghost; right-leaning opportunism is also a ghost. Various natural disasters are ghosts; encountering difficulties or setbacks is said to be "meeting a ghost." Some shortcomings and mistakes that occur in our progress can also be said to be "ghosts appearing." Ghosts all want to cause trouble. Causing trouble means creating chaos, and all kinds of ghosts create trouble for us. The most skillful kind of ghost is the young and beautiful female ghost. "Ghosts have three tricks: first, bewitching; second, obscuring; third, scaring." This kind of ghost is what we often call bourgeois individualism. This ghost often wanders around us, using fame, status, money, and beauty to bewitch you; it uses indecisive hesitation and worries about gains and losses to obscure your path forward. When you encounter difficulties or make mistakes in your work, it uses all kinds of ugly appearances (fear of criticism, fear of losing face, fear of punishment, etc.) to scare you. The ghost of individualism tries every possible means to make communists half-hearted towards the Party, leading you down the path of opposing the Party and ruining your own political life. This is a hanging ghost. When the noose of individualism tightens around your neck, isn't it political suicide?
　　No ghost is to be feared. As long as you have righteousness and courage. The story of Chen Pengnian blowing air to repel the strangling ghost narrates: "Chen privately thought, 'Ghosts still have energy, do I alone have no energy?' So he also mustered energy and blew at the woman, and where he blew, a hollow formed, first piercing the abdomen, then the chest, and finally the head disappeared. In an instant, it scattered like light smoke and was no longer seen." We can also say: The ghosts of bourgeois individualism and right-leaning opportunism still have energy, do Marxists-Leninists alone have no energy?! We must muster energy and blow them until their abdomen is pierced, their chest is pierced, their head disappears, and they scatter like smoke before stopping.
　　"I am good at cultivating my noble spirit." Communists must have a "noble spirit"—a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Being arrogant is not right, but we must be more arrogant towards ghosts. A forefather of Dai Dongyuan once said: "If you overpower it with your spirit, then the spirit will be strong and the ghost will not encroach; if you give in slightly, then the spirit will weaken and the ghost will take advantage." Those who lack the courage to overcome difficulties and show wavering towards the Party's general line, if they do not quickly firm up, then the ghost of right-leaning opportunism will take advantage.
　　Comrades with bourgeois individualistic thoughts, please read the "Mr. Broad-minded" story. That young female hanging ghost was looking for a substitute (what is commonly called a scapegoat). This is like the bourgeoisie being unwilling to die and wholeheartedly wanting to restore their position, wanting communists to die for them so that they themselves can be "reincarnated." Mr. Broad-minded was not afraid of the female ghost's bewitching, obscuring, or scaring, and did not help the female ghost to be reborn, but sang loudly: "What a great world, without obstruction or hindrance, death and rebirth, what is there to replace? If you want to go, then go, isn't it pleasant!" The final fate of capitalism's death has already been determined, and socialism has been generated, developed, and grown stronger on our land. The only way out for bourgeois elements is to obediently accept socialist transformation. All kinds of troublemaking ghosts will absolutely not get any benefit.
　　The old society was a world where demons were in power. Now the rule of demons has been overthrown, and night has turned into day. Ghosts are afraid of light. But in those dark corners, there are still ghosts hiding. Don't be afraid of ghosts, go and catch ghosts. Our task is to fight against ghosts, eliminate them completely, and make our world "forever free of trouble-makers."
　　Read stories of not fearing ghosts, think about what ghosts you have encountered, check for ghosts around you, and launch a "ghost busting" campaign.

　　〔Appendix〕Mr. Broad-minded
　　Cai Wei'gong, a Xiucai, often said: "Ghosts have three tricks: first, bewitching; second, obscuring; third, scaring." Someone asked what the three tricks were. He said: My cousin Lu, a Lin Sheng from Songjiang, has a bold personality and calls himself Mr. Broad-minded. He once passed through the western countryside of Maohu Lake. As it grew dark, he saw a woman with powdered face running in a flustered manner, holding a rope. Seeing Lu, she ran to hide under a large tree, and the rope she held fell to the ground. Lu picked it up to look at it and it was a grass rope. Smelling it, it had an aura of death. Knowing that it was a hanged ghost, he took it and hid it in his bosom and went forward. The woman came out from under the tree and blocked his way, moving left when he moved left, and right when he moved right. Lu knew this was what people commonly call "ghost blocking the wall." He charged straight ahead. The ghost had no choice but to let out a long howl and transform into a disheveled, bleeding figure with a tongue a foot long, jumping towards him. Lu said, "You first applied makeup to bewitch me; then you blocked me to obstruct me; now you make this ugly appearance to scare me. These are all your tricks and I am not afraid. I don't think you have any other tricks to use. Do you also know that I am known as Mr. Broad-minded?" The ghost returned to her original form and knelt on the ground, saying, "I am a woman named Shi from the city. I had an argument with my husband and hanged myself in a moment of shortsightedness. Now I heard that a woman in a family east of Maohu is also having trouble with her husband, so I went to find a substitute. I didn't expect to be stopped by you halfway, and you also took my rope. I am really at my wit's end, I only ask you to help me be reborn." Lu asked how to be reborn. She said, "Tell the Shi family in the city to hold a Daoist ceremony and ask high monks to chant the Rebirth Mantra more, and I can be reborn." Lu laughed and said, "I am a high monk. I have a Rebirth Mantra, I will recite it for you." Then he sang loudly: "What a great world, without obstruction or hindrance, death and rebirth, what is there to replace? If you want to go, then go, isn't it pleasant!" After hearing this, the ghost suddenly realized, prostrated herself again, and ran away. Later, the locals said, "This place was never peaceful, but since Mr. Broad-minded passed through, there have been no more troubles."
　　Chen Pengnian Blows Air to Repel Ghosts
　　When Chen Gong Pengnian was not yet successful, he was on good terms with his fellow villager Li Fu. One autumn evening, he took advantage of the moonlight to visit Li for a chat. Li was a poor scholar, and said to Chen, "I discussed getting wine with my wife but couldn't. Please sit for a while, I'll go out and buy wine to enjoy the moon with you." Chen held his poetry scroll and sat waiting for him. A woman in blue clothes with disheveled hair opened the door and entered, and then backed away upon seeing Chen. Chen suspected that she was a relative of Li and was avoiding him as a guest, so he sat sideways to avoid the woman. The woman brought something in her sleeve and hid it under the threshold, then walked inside. Chen wondered what it was, so he looked at the threshold and saw a rope, smelling of blood. Chen realized that this was a hanging ghost, so he took the rope and put it in his boot, and sat as before. After a while, the disheveled woman came out, and was angered to find the rope she had hidden was missing. She rushed directly in front of Chen and shouted, "Return my thing!" Chen said, "What thing?" The woman did not answer, but stood tall and blew at Chen, a gust of cold wind like ice, making his hair and teeth chatter, and the lamp flickered a ghostly green color and was about to go out. Chen privately thought, "Ghosts still have energy, do I alone have no energy?" So he also mustered energy and blew at the woman, and where he blew, a hollow formed, first piercing the abdomen, then the chest, and finally the head disappeared. In an instant, it scattered like light smoke and was no longer seen. After a while, Li came in with the wine and shouted that his wife had hanged herself on the bed. Chen laughed and said, "It's nothing, the ghost's rope is still in my boot." He told him what had happened, and they both went in to untie and rescue her. They gave her ginger soup to drink, and she awoke. When asked why she wanted to die, his wife said, "My family is poor, and my husband keeps entertaining guests. I only have one hairpin left on my head, and he took it to sell for wine, which made me very sad. The guest is outside, so I can't complain. Suddenly, a woman with disheveled hair, claiming to be the left neighbor, told me that my husband did not take the hairpin for the guest, but to go to gamble. I felt more depressed, and thought that it was late at night, my husband would not return, and the guest would not leave, and I had no face to dismiss the guest. The woman with disheveled hair made a circle with her hand and said, 'Entering through this is the Buddhist kingdom, with boundless joy.' I entered through this circle, but my hand was not tight, and the circle repeatedly broke apart. The woman said, 'Take what my Buddha brought, and you will become a Buddha.' I went out to take it, but she did not come back for a long time. I was drowsy as if in a dream, and then you came to save me." Upon asking the neighbors, they said that a village woman had indeed hanged herself several months ago.

　　来一个“打鬼”运动
　　——写在不怕鬼的故事前面
　　王任重
    历史上有许多不怕鬼的故事。那些胆小的人看了这些故事，可能会长点胆量。也许有的人看了鬼的故事，夜晚会做恶梦。我们共产党人是唯物主义者，是不相信鬼神的。但是人们从小听说过许多鬼的故事，害怕的心理一时还难以完全消除。这和一部分中国人怕洋鬼子的心理是相同的。怕鬼，怕洋人都是一种自卑感，是一种奴隶性的表现。为了改变这种精神状态，看看不怕鬼的故事很有好处。
    现实生活当中有没有鬼呢？书上说的那种鬼是没有的。可是有另外的许多鬼，却常常出现在我们身边。地、富、反、坏、右都是鬼；资产阶级思想也是鬼；右倾机会主义也是鬼。各种自然灾害都是鬼；遇到困难或挫折，说是“碰了鬼”。我们前进当中发生的某些缺点、错误，也可以说是“出了鬼”。鬼都是要作祟的。作祟就是捣乱，各种鬼都给我们找麻烦。技巧技术最高明的一种鬼，是年轻貌美的女鬼。“鬼有三技：一迷、二遮、三吓”，这种鬼就是我们常说的资产阶级个人主义。这种鬼常常在我们的身边游荡，她用名誉、地位、金钱、美女来迷你，她又用优柔寡断患得患失的障碍，遮住你前进的道路。当你在工作中遇到困难或者犯了错误的时候，她又用种种恶状（怕批评、怕丢脸、怕处分等等）来吓唬你。个人主义之鬼，千方百计地要使共产党员对党三心二意，一直使你走上反党的道路，使你自己断送自己的政治生命。这是一种吊死鬼。当个人主义的鬼索套住你的脖子的时候，难道不就是政治生命的自杀吗？
    什么鬼都不可怕。只要你有正气和勇气。陈鹏年吹气退缢鬼，这一篇里叙述道：“陈私念：‘鬼尚有气，我独无气乎？’乃亦鼓气吹妇，妇当公吹处，成一空洞，始而腹穿，继而胸穿，终乃头灭。顷刻，如轻烟散尽，不复见矣。”我们也可以这样说：资产阶级个人主义之鬼，右倾机会主义之鬼尚且有气，马克思列宁主义者独无气乎？！必须鼓气而吹之，使其腹穿、胸穿、头灭、烟散而后止。
    “吾善养吾浩然之气”。共产党人必须有“浩然之气”——敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。盛气凌人不对，但是必须盛气凌鬼。戴东原的祖辈有个人说：“以气凌之，则气盛而鬼不逼；稍有牵就，则气馁而鬼乘之矣。”对于克服困难缺乏勇气，对于党的总路线表现动摇的人，如不迅速坚定起来，则右倾机会主义之鬼将乘之矣。
    有资产阶级个人主义思想的同志，请读“豁达先生”篇。那一位年轻的女吊死鬼是要找替代的（俗话说的替死鬼）。这就像资产阶级不甘心死亡、一心想要复辟一样，让共产党人替他们死，好让他们自己去“托生”。豁达先生既不怕女鬼的迷、遮、吓，又没有替女鬼超生，而高唱曰：“好大世界，无遮无碍，死去生来，有何替代？要走便走，岂不爽快！”资本主义最后死亡的命运已经注定了，社会主义在我国的土地上产生和发展壮大起来了。资产阶级分子只有乖乖地接受社会主义改造才有出路。各种作祟的鬼，都是绝对得不到什么好处的。
    旧社会是魔鬼当道的世界。现在魔鬼的统治是被打倒了，黑夜变成了白昼。鬼是怕光明的。但是在那些阴暗的角落里，还藏着有鬼。不要怕鬼，要去捉鬼。我们的任务是要和鬼作斗争，把鬼消灭干净，使我们的世界“永无为祟者”。
    看看不怕鬼的故事，想一想自己遇见过什么鬼，查一查身边有什么鬼，来一个“打鬼”运动。
                      〔原载“七一”杂志1959年第十期〕
   〔附〕豁达先生
    蔡魏公孝廉常言：“鬼有三技，一迷、二遮、三吓。”或问三技云何？曰：我表弟吕某，松江廪生?。性豪放，自号豁达先生。尝过泖湖西乡，天渐黑，见妇人面施粉黛，贸贸然持绳索而奔。望见吕，走避大树下，而所持绳则遗坠地上。吕取观，乃一条草索，嗅之，有阴霾之气。心知为缢死鬼，取藏怀中，径向前行。其女出树中，往前遮拦，左行则左拦，右行则右拦。吕心知俗所称“鬼打墙”是也，直冲而行。鬼无奈何，长啸一声，变作披发流血状，伸舌尺许，向之跳跃。吕曰：“汝前之涂眉画粉，迷我也；向前阻拒，遮我也；今作此恶状，吓我也。三技毕矣，我总不怕，想无他技可施。尔亦知我素名豁达先生乎？”鬼仍复原形跪地，曰：“我城中施姓女子，与夫口角，一时短见自缢。今闻泖东某家妇，亦与其夫不睦，故我往取替代，不料半路被先生截住，又将我绳夺去，我实在计穷，只求先生超生。”吕问作何超法。曰：“替我告知城中施家作道场，请高僧多念往生咒，我便可托生。”吕笑曰：“我即高僧也，我有往生咒，为汝一诵。”即高唱曰：“好大世界，无遮无碍，死去生来，有何替代？要走便走，岂不爽快！”鬼听毕，恍然大悟，伏地再拜，奔趋而去。后土人云：“此处向不平静，自豁达先生过后，永无为祟者。”
    陈鹏年吹气退鬼
    陈公鹏年未遇?时，与乡人李孚相善。秋夕，乘月色过李闲话。李故寒士?，谓陈曰：“与妇谋酒不得，子少坐，我外出沽酒，与子赏月。”陈持其诗卷，坐观待之。门外有妇人，蓝衣蓬首开户入，见陈便却去。陈疑李氏戚也，避客，故不入，乃侧坐避妇人。妇人袖物来，藏门槛下，身走入内。陈心疑何物，就槛视之，一绳也，嗅有血痕；陈悟此乃缢鬼，取其绳置靴中。坐如故。少顷，蓬首妇出，探藏处失绳，怒。直奔陈前，呼曰：“还我物！”陈曰：“何物？”妇不答，但耸立张口吹陈，冷风一阵如冰，毛发噤齘，灯荧荧青色将灭。陈私念：“鬼尚有气，我独无气乎？”乃亦鼓气吹妇，妇当公吹处，成一空洞，始而腹穿，继而胸穿，终乃头灭。顷刻，如轻烟散尽，不复见矣。少顷，李持酒入，大呼妇缢于床。陈笑曰：“无伤也，鬼绳尚在我靴。”告之故，乃共入解救。灌以姜汤，苏?。问何故寻死，其妻曰：“家贫，其夫君好客不已，头止一钗，拔去沽酒，心闷甚，客又在外，未便声张。旁忽有蓬首妇人，自称左邻，告我以夫非为客拔钗也，将赴赌钱场耳。我愈郁恨，且念夜深，夫不归，客不去，无面目辞客。蓬首妇手作圈曰：‘从此入即佛国，欢喜无量。’余从此圈入，而手套不紧，圈屡散。妇人曰：‘取吾佛带来，则成佛矣。’走出取带，良久不来。余方冥然若梦，而君来救矣。”访之邻，数月前，果缢死一村妇。
                        （原载清袁枚著：“子不语”）
    〔注〕?在封建时代科举制度时学生得到政府发给的廪禄（粮食等）待遇的，叫作“廪膳生员”，简称廪生。
          ?未遇，还没有被人赏识的意思。
          ?寒士，贫苦的读书人。
          ?苏，苏醒。
