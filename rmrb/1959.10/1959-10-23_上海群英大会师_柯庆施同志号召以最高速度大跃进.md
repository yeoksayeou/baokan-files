Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 22nd: The grand Shanghai Municipal Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade opened yesterday. Over 10,000 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from grassroots units across the city attended the congress. This congress is a review of the brilliant achievements of Shanghai since the Great Leap Forward, a conference to commend the advanced and exchange experiences, and also a mobilization meeting to continue opposing right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and strive for continued Great Leap Forward. At yesterday's meeting, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor of Shanghai, called on all workers and people of the city to hold high the red flag of the General Line, continue to advance bravely at the highest speed, not only to complete the state industrial production plan for this year ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter, but also to make all preparations so that Shanghai's industrial production will continue to achieve a high-speed Great Leap Forward next year.

Ke Qingshi said: The current situation is very good. It is extremely good, unprecedentedly good. As of the end of September, the city's total industrial output value had reached 16.75 billion yuan, an increase of 47.1% over the same period last year, and 73% of the annual state plan had been completed. It is estimated that Shanghai's industrial output value this year can increase by more than 40% compared to last year. The Great Leap Forward this year is definitely beyond doubt. The current task is to strive to fully complete the state plan for this year ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter, and to make all preparations for the goal of ensuring that the production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that of the fourth quarter of this year. Achieving this task will enable us to produce more equipment to support the urgent needs of production and construction in various regions, and to produce more commodities to meet the needs of the national market. Achieving this task will not only secure a complete victory in continuing the Great Leap Forward this year, but also create favorable conditions for continuing the Great Leap Forward next year.

Ke Qingshi said that, like the rest of the country, Shanghai will definitely have another year of continued Great Leap Forward next year. On the basis of the two years of Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, even though the base figure for industrial output value is getting larger and larger, the growth rate of Shanghai's industrial output value in 1960 should still strive to continue to advance at a speed similar to this year. Developing our industry at such a high speed is entirely possible, whether viewed from the perspective of the mass conditions, technical conditions, or equipment conditions in Shanghai, as long as we adhere to the implementation of the General Line and mobilize all positive factors.

Ke Qingshi said: Reactionaries at home and abroad once wantonly attacked our country's Great Leap Forward. Later, they had to admit that our Great Leap Forward last year was a fact, but they insisted that our Great Leap Forward had only a one-year fate, and that we could have a Great Leap Forward last year, but we could not continue the Great Leap Forward this year. Now, they have failed once again. We have continued the Great Leap Forward this year on the basis of last year, and it can be predicted that we can still achieve victory in the Great Leap Forward next year. The current situation once again proves the complete correctness of the General Line of socialist construction formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with China's actual conditions.

Ke Qingshi proposed that, in order to complete this year's state plan ahead of schedule and make all preparations for continuing the Great Leap Forward next year, all cadres and the working class in Shanghai must earnestly do the following:

First, adhere to putting politics in command. The entire Party, all cadres, the working people of the city, and the people of the city must profoundly recognize the correctness of the General Line, resolutely repel the attacks of right-leaning opportunists, consciously support the General Line, defend the General Line, and unswervingly fight to the end to realize the General Line. Do not bow our heads in the face of any difficulties, and do not waver in the face of any storms. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the red flag of the General Line, if everyone thinks alike, understands alike, and turns thousands of hearts and tens of thousands of hearts into one heart, the Great Leap Forward will have a reliable guarantee.

Second, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution more deeply and more extensively. We must adopt the method of "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and "three combinations" of large, medium, and small enterprises, carry out major innovations, find small tips, involve everyone, and enable technical innovation and technical revolution to blossom everywhere and bear fruit everywhere. We should have the determination and ambition to catch up with the world's most advanced level in the shortest possible time. Therefore, we must arm ourselves with the idea of continuous revolution, constantly break superstitions, liberate our minds, and advance again and again.

Third, the broad masses of cadres must adhere to the working method of the mass line. Every cadre must become an ordinary worker, be like family with the masses, and speak from the heart. We must have a democratic style, earnestly consult with the masses, treat the masses with sincerity, modesty, and patience, and must also communicate from the heart. Difficulties, no matter how great, will be easy to handle as long as everyone takes them on together.

Ke Qingshi said: Under the leadership of the Party, the working class in Shanghai has a glorious historical tradition of revolutionary steadfastness and revolutionary pioneering spirit forged through long-term revolutionary struggles. The advanced collectives and advanced producers have inherited and developed the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Shanghai working class, and have a noble revolutionary style and excellent class qualities. You are the essence of the Shanghai working class, the backbone of the Great Leap Forward, and the warriors who defend the Party's General Line. Our Party, our country, and our era need a large number of people like you who dare to speak, dare to think, and dare to act. Dare to break superstitions, break through all conventions, and overcome all difficulties; dare to continuously revolutionize, continuously leap forward, and continuously strive for the top; dare to adhere to the truth, charge into battle for the truth, withstand the sarcasm of cold words, withstand the impact of great storms, see through the true colors of right-leaning opportunists, refute the fallacies of right-leaning opportunism, and repel the attacks of right-leaning opportunism. Relying on such people, uniting the broad masses, we will certainly be able to unswervingly defend the Party's General Line and implement the Party's General Line, and build our country into a prosperous, advanced, and great socialist country at the highest speed.

At the congress, representatives to the national "Conference of Heroes" were selected, and awards were presented to more than 3,000 advanced collectives and advanced producers at the municipal level.

    上海群英大会师
    柯庆施同志号召以最高速度大跃进
    新华社上海22日电　盛大的上海市工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面的先进集体和先进生产者代表大会昨天开幕。出席这个大会的有全市基层单位的先进集体代表和先进生产者一万多人。这次大会是上海市大跃进以来辉煌成就的检阅大会，是表扬先进、交流经验的大会，也是继续反右倾鼓干劲，争取继续大跃进的誓师大会。在昨天的大会上，中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施，号召全市职工和全市人民高举总路线的红旗，继续以最高速度奋勇前进，不仅要在第四季度提前十天到十五天完成今年国家工业生产计划，而且要作好一切准备，使明年上海的工业生产继续高速度大跃进。
    柯庆施说：当前的形势好得很。是非常的好，空前的好。到9月底为止，全市工业总产值已达到一百六十七点五亿元，比去年同期增长47.1％，已经完成了全年国家计划的73％；预计今年上海工业产值可以比去年增加40％以上。今年大跃进是肯定无疑的。当前的任务是：要力争在第四季度内提前十天到十五天全面完成今年的国家计划，并且为明年第一季度生产水平不低于今年第四季度的目标做好一切准备。实现这个任务，我们就可以生产更多的设备支援各地生产建设的迫切需要，就可以生产更多的商品供应全国市场的需要。实现这个任务，不但能够取得今年继续大跃进的全胜，而且能够为明年继续大跃进创造良好的条件。
    柯庆施说，上海和全国一样，明年肯定将是继续大跃进的一年。在1958、1959两年大跃进的基础上，尽管工业产值的基数越来越大，1960年上海工业产值的增长速度仍然应该力争同今年相差不多的速度继续前进。用这样的高速度发展我们的工业，不论从上海的群众条件、技术条件、设备条件等方面来看，只要坚持贯彻执行总路线，调动一切积极因素，是完全可能的。
    柯庆施说：国内外反动派曾经大肆攻击我国大跃进，后来他们不得不承认我国去年大跃进是事实，但又咬定我国大跃进只有一年的命运，去年能够大跃进，今年不能继续大跃进。现在，他们又一次失败了。我们今年又在去年的基础上继续大跃进，可以预料明年仍然可以取得大跃进的胜利。当前的形势再一次证明了党中央和毛泽东同志根据马列主义的普遍真理结合中国的实际情况制订的社会主义建设总路线的完全正确。
    柯庆施提出，为了提前超额完成今年国家计划，做好明年继续大跃进的一切准备工作，全体干部和上海工人阶级，必须认真做好以下几点：
    一、坚持政治挂帅。全党、全体干部、全市劳动人民和全市人民，要深刻地认识到总路线的正确性，坚决击退右倾机会主义者的进攻，自觉地拥护总路线、保卫总路线，坚定不移地为实现总路线而奋斗到底。在任何困难下不低头，在任何风浪下都不动摇。在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，在总路线的红旗之下，大家思想一致、认识一致，千条心万条心变成一条心，大跃进就有了可靠的保证。
    二、更深入、更广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命。必须采用领导干部、工人、技术人员“三结合”和大中小“三结合”的方法，大革新要搞，小窍门也要找，人人动手，个个逞能，使技术革新和技术革命遍地开花、到处结果。应当有决心、有志气，在尽可能短的时期内迎头赶上世界最先进水平。因此，一定要以不断革命的思想武装自己，不断地破除迷信，解放思想，前进再前进。
    三，广大干部必须坚持群众路线的工作方法。每个干部要成为普通劳动者，同群众是一家人，讲知心话。要有民主作风，认真同群众商量，同群众相处要诚心、虚心、耐心，而且还必须交心。天大的困难只要大家挑起来就好办了。
    柯庆施说：上海工人阶级在党的领导下，经过长期的革命斗争的锻炼，富有革命坚定性和革命首创精神的光荣历史传统。先进集体和先进生产者继承和发展了上海工人阶级光荣的革命传统，具有高尚的革命风格和优秀的阶级品质；你们是上海工人阶级的精华，是大跃进的中坚，是保卫党的总路线的战士。我们的党、我们的国家，我们的时代，需要大批像你们一样敢说、敢想、敢做的人。敢于破除迷信，突破一切陈规，战胜一切困难；敢于不断革命、不断跃进、不断力争上游；敢于坚持真理，为真理冲锋陷阵，经得起冷言冷语的讽刺，顶得住大风大浪的冲击，看得穿右倾机会主义分子的真面目，驳得倒右倾机会主义的谬论，打得退右倾机会主义的进攻。依靠这样的人，团结广大群众，一定能够坚定不移地保卫党的总路线和贯彻党的总路线，最高速度地把我国建设成为富强的、先进的、伟大的社会主义国家。
    在大会上，选出了出席全国“群英会”的代表，并且向三千多个市一级的先进集体和先进生产者授奖。
