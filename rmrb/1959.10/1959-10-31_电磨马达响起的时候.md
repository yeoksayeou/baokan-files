    When the Electric Mill Motor Sounds
    Xue Yugui, Da Hanji Village Production Team, Fangshan People's Commune, Zhoukoudian District, Beijing

    Our production team recently installed an electric mill, and its motor runs many times every day.
    Every time the motor of that electric steel mill starts, I always think of how our whole family used to laboriously push the millstone. Back then, to get food, our family had to push the millstone every few days. Every time we pushed the millstone, everyone was extremely busy, especially my mother and sister-in-law, who were often too busy to even cook. Before liberation, we peasants lived a life of semi-starvation. My mother and sister-in-law worked diligently in the fields all day, and when they returned home in the evening, they often hadn't even had a chance to rest their feet or have a drink of cold water before they had to rush to grind the grain they had brought back from the fields. After pushing all night, half of it would be eaten in one meal. In winter, our hands and feet were frozen stiff, and everyone used all their strength, yet we could only grind forty or fifty pounds of grain a day. After liberation, from joining mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, life improved day by day. The days of being poorly clothed and not having enough to eat were gone forever. But to eat, we still had to push the millstone. My sister-in-law and I pushed, while my mother swept and sifted. After pushing all day, we were so tired that our backs ached, our legs were sore, and we saw stars. Really, pushing the millstone and grinding grain didn't seem any easier than working in the fields or driving carts! "When will we not have to push the millstone anymore?" I often thought to myself at the time.
    Who would have believed that less than a year after the people's communes were established, a poor production team like ours would install an electric mill? Normally, a woman and a livestock could grind at most a hundred or so pounds of grain a day with a stone mill. In a village like ours with more than 1,600 people to feed, we didn't know how much manpower and animal power had to be spent on pushing the millstone every day. Now that we have installed such a 7.5 horsepower electric mill, the electric mill can grind more than 8,000 pounds of wheat in a day and night. If it grinds corn, it can grind more than 15,000 pounds. The amount of grain ground by the electric mill in one day is more than our whole family grinding for more than five months. After the installation of the electric mill, the entire production team can free up at least twenty women and twenty livestock laborers every day to participate in farm work. The electric mill has liberated people from the extremely tiring millstone. How can this not make people happy?
    If we had relied solely on the strength of our poor production team (during the advanced cooperative period last year, we could only get 16 cents for each workday), we could hardly have accumulated the funds to install an electric mill, even if we had exhausted all our efforts in spring plowing, summer planting, autumn harvesting, and winter storage. But with the people's commune, relying on the collective strength, everything is easy to handle. The "poor and blank" production team really did install a 7.5 horsepower electric mill! There are many more things to be happy about. The offices and several public canteens of our production team have also installed twenty-odd electric lights, shining brightly; since the communization, although our whole village has transferred ninety-odd male full laborers to support the country's various construction projects (such as building the Miyun Reservoir), the per-mu yield of wheat has increased by 147.2% compared with the advanced cooperative period. At the same time, we have also reclaimed more than one hundred mu of wasteland. Aren't all these miracles? But these are all facts! These are all brought about by the people's commune!
    Our production team is just a drop of water in the ocean of people's communes across the country. But from this drop of water, one can also see the picture of the vast ocean, and see the surging waves in the ocean! When I hear a small handful of right-leaning opportunists viciously slander "the people's communes were established too quickly," "there was no objective necessity for the establishment of the people's communes," and "people's lives are hard after the establishment of the people's communes," my heart cannot help but be filled with anger, because from our poor production team, we have indeed seen the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, which cannot be erased by any lies!
    From the window came the sound of the newly installed electric mill motor in the production team again. My heart couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. Looking back on the hard days of pushing the millstone and grinding grain, and looking forward to the future, who can not be happy for the happy present and the infinitely beautiful tomorrow? I am sincerely delighted for our ever-improving and ever-changing poor production team, and I, like many men, women, old and young in the village, have a greater love for the people's commune, which is like a rising sun.

    电磨马达响起的时候
    北京周口店区房山人民公社大韩继村生产队　薛玉贵
    我们的生产队新近安装了电磨，它的马达每天要响好多回。
    每一次当那只电力钢磨马达声响起的时候，我总是要想起从前我们全家辛辛苦苦推碾子的样儿。那时，我们家为了吃饭，隔几天就得推一次碾子。每逢推碾子，大家忙得团团转，特别是母亲和嫂子，时常忙得连饭都顾不得做。在解放以前，咱农民过的是半饥半饱的生活，母亲和嫂子整天辛辛苦苦地在地里劳动，晚上回到家，往往还没站住脚，喝口凉水就得赶紧把从地里弄来的一些粮食拿到碾子上去磨。推一大晚上，一顿饭就吃去一大半。冬天，手脚都冻僵了，大伙儿用尽全身力量，一天也不过磨四五十斤粮食。解放以后，从加入了互助组、初级社到高级社，生活一天天有了改善。衣不遮体，食不饱肚的日子已经一去不复返了。可是，要吃饭，还得推碾子。我和嫂子推，母亲连扫代筛。推一天累得腰痛腿酸，眼睛冒金星。真的，推碾推磨看来并不比在地里的活儿和赶大车来的容易呀！“什么时候才可以不推碾子呢？”我当时时常这么想。
    谁相信人民公社化还不到一年，像我们这么一个穷生产队就安上了电磨？平常，一个妇女一头牲口一盘磨推一天最多不过磨一百来斤粮食。像我们这样有一千六百多人吃饭的村子，为了推碾子，每天不知道要花费掉多少人力和牲畜力。现在安上了这么一个七点五马力的电磨以后，电磨一动，一昼夜就能磨出八千多斤小麦，如果磨玉米，可以磨到一万五千多斤。电磨一天磨的粮食，比我们全家都来推磨五个多月磨的还多。安装电磨之后，全生产队每日至少可以腾出二十几个妇女劳力和二十来匹牲口参加农活。电磨使人们从极端劳累的碾台上解放了出来。这怎么不叫人高兴呢？
    如果光凭我们这个穷生产队（去年高级社时期，我们每个劳动日只能得到一角六分）的力量，那怕竭尽股肱之力，春耕，夏种，秋收，冬藏，也不容易积累下安装电磨的资金，可是，有了人民公社，靠着集体的力量，什么都好办了。“一穷二白”的生产队，可真就安装上了一个七点五马力的电磨呀！叫人高兴的事儿还多着呢。我们生产队的办公室和几个人民食堂也安装上了二十几盏电灯，大放光明；公社化以后，我们全村虽然调出九十几个男整劳力，支援祖国的各项建设（如到密云修水库等），而小麦亩产量却比高级社时期增加了147.2％，同时，还开垦了一百多亩荒地，所有这些，不都是奇迹吗？但这都是事实呀！这都是人民公社给带来的呀！
    咱这个生产队，不过是全国范围内人民公社海洋里的一滴水。而从这一滴水，也可以看到汪洋浩海的图景，看到了浩海里澎湃奔腾着的大浪！当我听到一小撮的右倾机会主义分子恶毒地污蔑“人民公社搞快了”、“人民公社成立没有客观必然性”，“人民公社成立后人民生活苦”这些胡说的时候，我的心不能不充满了忿怒，因为从咱这个穷生产队，的的确确看到了人民公社的无比优越性，这是任何谎言抹煞不了的呀！
    从窗口又传来了生产队新安装的电磨的马达声。我心里不禁发出一阵阵热，回想过去辛辛苦苦推碾推磨的日子，展望将来，谁能不为幸福的今天和无限美好的明天而高兴呢？我为我们蒸蒸日上、日新月异的穷底子生产队而感到衷心的喜悦，我也像村里的许多男女老少一样，对于初升太阳般的人民公社更加热爱了。
