Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 10th: The delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, at the invitation of the Indonesian Parliament, arrived here this afternoon aboard a Tu-104 jet for a two-week visit. The head of the ten-member delegation is Nuritdin Mukhitdinov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet.

In a brief speech at the airport, Mukhitdinov said that the visit would strengthen the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries, which would benefit the people of both countries and world peace. He said that the two countries have traditional friendly relations, and since Indonesia's independence, the friendly relations between the two countries have been further developed.

He pointed out that the parliaments of both countries had once made such decisions: all foreign troops should return to their countries and nuclear weapons testing should be banned. He said that the parliaments of the two countries are active fighters for the ideal of peaceful coexistence among all countries, and that peaceful coexistence is the only path to world peace. He also said that the two countries' desire for peace is the foundation for the development of friendly relations between the two countries.
