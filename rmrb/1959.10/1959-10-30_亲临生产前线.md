    Going to the Production Front Lines

    At present, it is very necessary to conduct a thorough inspection of the production increase and conservation campaign to promote its further development. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the local city and county committees, have formed inspection teams of hundreds of thousands of people and sent them to the forefront of production. By eating, living, and working alongside the masses, they are conducting a comprehensive inspection of the work, discovering problems, solving them in a timely manner, and summarizing experiences for immediate promotion. This has already yielded significant results.

    Leaders going to the front lines and taking the lead in work is an excellent tradition of our Party's cadres. Forever maintaining and promoting this style will enable our cause to advance by leaps and bounds forever. Especially when a mass production upsurge is about to be launched or has already formed, leading cadres at all levels should go to the production front lines to assist grassroots cadres in directing operations. This will give the masses tremendous encouragement, further boosting their already high production enthusiasm, and ensuring that problems in the work are resolved more promptly. Furthermore, after cadres go deep into the masses, they will be inspired by the masses' ever-increasing labor enthusiasm, gaining enlightenment and further increasing their drive and confidence, as well as enriching their work experience. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The example of the masses inspires the cadres, and the example of the cadres also inspires the masses." The drive and enthusiasm of leading cadres and the masses, the wisdom and experience of leading cadres and the masses, mutually cooperating and promoting each other, will generate new and greater strength, pushing the already formed new high tide of production forward with wave upon wave of vigorous advance!

    亲临生产前线
    在目前深入地开展一次增产节约运动的大检查，对于推动增产节约运动的进一步发展，很有必要。中共湖南省委以及各地、市、县委，组成了有几十万人参加的检查团，开到生产最前线去，在和群众同吃同住同劳动中，对工作进行全面的大检查，发现问题，及时解决，总结经验，随即推广，已经收到显著的效果。
    领导上前线，工作带头干，这是我们党的干部的优良作风。永远保持和发扬这种作风，就能使我们的事业永远大步前进。特别是在群众的生产热潮就要掀起或者已经形成的时候，各级领导干部亲临生产前线，协助基层干部指挥作战，就会给群众以极大的鼓舞，使群众高涨的生产热情更加高涨，使工作中的问题更加及时的得到解决。而干部深入下去以后，也会被群众日益高涨的劳动热情所激动，从中得到启示，从而进一步增长自己的干劲和信心，丰富自己的工作经验。正如刘少奇同志所说的：“群众的榜样激动了干部，干部的榜样也激动了群众”。领导干部和群众的干劲和热情，领导干部和群众的智慧和经验，互相配合，互相促进，就会产生出新的更伟大的力量，推动已经形成的生产新高潮，一浪高过一浪地勇猛前进！
