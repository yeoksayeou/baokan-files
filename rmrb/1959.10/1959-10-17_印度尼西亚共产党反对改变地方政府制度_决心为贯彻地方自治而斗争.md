Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 13th: A resolution passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party states that the Indonesian Communist Party has decided to reject Presidential Decree No. 6 of 1959, drafted by Minister of Interior and Local Autonomy Ipiq Gandamana. "People's Daily" today published this resolution issued by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party.

Presidential Decree No. 6 of 1959 is a decree recently issued by the government regarding changes to the local government system. This decree changes the heads of local governments, who were previously elected, to being appointed by the government instead of being commissioned by local councils. Ipiq intends to use this decree to replace the local autonomy laws that have been in effect since 1957, which were passed by the popularly elected parliament.

The resolution states that this presidential decree runs counter to the 1945 Constitution and Sukarno's political manifesto, and is anti-democratic and anti-cooperative. It restores the personal dictatorship of the colonial period, thereby abandoning local autonomy. It does not protect the rights of local councils; on the contrary, it will create local despotism.

The resolution states that the Indonesian Communist Party insists on Law No. 1 of 1957 regarding local autonomy and will fight for its implementation.

Opposition to the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 6 has become one of the central issues in the current Indonesian political situation. The Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Islamic Teachers Association, and the Indonesian Communist Party are all opposed to the implementation of this decision. The Masyumi Party has not yet come out against this decision, but its members in the central and local councils are opposing the implementation of this decision along with other political parties. Although these parties all oppose this decision, their motives and determination vary.

The Speaker of the Central Java Regional Council, Imam Sofian, met with Ipiq yesterday and handed him a resolution from the Central Java Council. The resolution recommends postponing the implementation of this decision. Sofian said that the Central Java Regional Military Commander has ordered the Central Java local authorities to temporarily postpone the implementation of Decree No. 6 until after the Indonesian first-level administrative district conference is held in Bandung.

Many provincial, municipal, and county local councils have held meetings separately or jointly to express their opposition to Decree No. 6. The Solo City Council recently unanimously passed a resolution rejecting this decision and demanding that the central government allow the Supreme Advisory Council and Parliament to discuss this issue.

At the same time, the government is preparing to implement this decision. Ipiq has also announced several specific regulations related to the implementation of this decision. Minister of Defense and Security Nasution recently said that during his inspection tour of West Java, "he did not see any plans to postpone the implementation of Decree No. 6." He also said that the spirit of the 1945 Constitution is that the orders issued by the top leadership must be implemented.

There are indications that orders have been issued in some places to implement the presidential decree in advance. The West Java Provincial Council has issued notices to its members based on Ipiq's circular, requiring them to take the oath again on October 20. If they do not take the oath by the 28th, they will no longer be members of the council.

### 印度尼西亚共产党反对改变地方政府制度  决心为贯彻地方自治而斗争

　　印度尼西亚共产党反对改变地方政府制度
    决心为贯彻地方自治而斗争
    据新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会通过的一项决议说，印度尼西亚共产党决定拒绝由内政和地方自治部长伊皮克·甘达曼纳拟订的1959年第六号总统决定。“人民日报”今天刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处发表的这项决议。
    1959年第六号总统决定是政府最近发表的关于改变地方政府制度的法令。这个法令使以前由选举产生的地方政府首长改由政府任命，而不由地方议会委任。伊皮克决定用这个法令来代替1957年以来已经实行的地方自治法令，地方自治法令是由民选的国会通过的。
    决议说，这个总统决定同1945年宪法和苏加诺的政治宣言是背道而驰的，是反民主和反合作的。它恢复了殖民地时期个人独裁的政府制度，从而抛弃了地方自治。它不保护地方议会的权利，相反，它将造成地方专制。
    决议说，印度尼西亚共产党坚持1957年第一号关于地方自治的法令，并且将为贯彻执行这个法令而斗争。
    反对执行第六号总统决定已成为印度尼西亚当前政局的中心问题之一。印度尼西亚国民党、伊斯兰教师联合会和印度尼西亚共产党都反对执行这个决定。马斯友美党还没有出来反对这个决定，但是它在中央和地方议会的议员同其他政党一起反对执行这个决定。这些政党虽然都反对这个决定，但是它们的动机和坚决程度是不同的。
    中爪哇地方议会议长伊马姆·索菲安昨天会见了伊皮克，将中爪哇议会的一份决议交给他。决议建议延期执行这个决定。索菲安说，中爪哇地方军事首长已命令中爪哇地方当局暂时延期执行第六号决定，直到印度尼西亚一级行政区会议在万隆举行以后。
    许多省、市和县的地方议会都分别或联合举行会议表示反对第六号决定。梭罗市议会最近一致通过一项决议，拒绝这个决定，并且要求中央政府让最高谘询委员会和国会讨论这个问题。
    同时，政府还在为执行这一决定进行准备。伊皮克还宣布了有关执行这一决定的若干具体条例。国防和安全部长纳苏蒂安最近说，当他在西爪哇进行视察旅行期间，“他看不到延缓执行第六号决定的任何计划”。他又说，1945年宪法的精神，是最高领导所发出的命令，必须加以执行。
    有迹象说明，在某些地方已经下令预先执行总统决定。西爪哇省地方议会已经根据伊皮克的通告向议员们发出通知，要他们在10月20日再一次宣誓。如果他们到28日还不宣誓，他们就将不再成为议员。
