　　Making People Fly Like Birds

　　For many generations, enthusiasts have designed and manufactured wings, attempting to fly into the sky using the strength of their own muscles, but all their attempts have failed.

　　Recent scientific and technological achievements have provided the possibility of seriously studying the laws of bird flight and finding ways to replicate it. New plastics enable people to create particularly lightweight and strong wings. In the Soviet Union, research and manufacturing work has begun on ornithopters—aircraft with two flapping wings. What is attracting designers to create such machines?

　　Simply mentioning the following point highlights the practical benefits of ornithopters: their lift is three to four times greater than that of ordinary airplanes and seven to nine times greater than that of helicopters. This superior flight quality allows them to carry much heavier loads with less engine power.

　　Ornithopters can take off without a run and land gliding, one of the most important conditions for flight safety. Bird-like aircraft do not need airports. They can safely take off from cliffs or rooftops, something gliders cannot do. Ornithopters will not be damaged in a spiral flight.

　　The economy and safety of ornithopters provide the possibility of establishing new, mass-scale air transport. They could be as common as bicycles and motorcycles. Mass production of ornithopters will open up broad possibilities for the development of gliding, air travel, and aviation sports.

　　In the Soviet Union, there is a social organization dedicated to the design and creation of ornithopters: the Ornithopter Flight Committee affiliated with the Central Aviation Club of the Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of this committee include aerodynamists, ornithologists, aviation designers, test pilots, and young students. Ornithopter Flight Committee branches have been established in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and other Soviet republics.

　　At the beginning of this year, a scientific and technological conference on ornithopter flight was held in Moscow, attended by one hundred and eighty people. Over five days, the research and design work carried out in the construction of ornithopters was discussed and summarized.

　　The materials already obtained allow enthusiasts working on ornithopter flight to proceed to devise methods for creating flyable models and actual ornithopters. Experimenters are conducting experiments in two areas: one is to build aircraft powered by human hands or feet, and the other is to build aircraft that convert the rotational movement of an engine into the flapping motion of wings.

　　The earliest style of ornithopter wing was made in the Soviet Union by designer Datlin from vines and whalebone, according to the formal dimensions of a flapping wing. Datlin's wing was very effective.

　　Not long ago, amateur inventor Serebryakov-Zheblikov conducted tests of a foot-powered ornithopter in Sestroretsk near Leningrad. With a wind force of 4-6 meters per second, he flew forward ten meters from a small height. In Frunze, Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic, another teacher and inventor, Grabovsky, sitting in the ornithopter-helicopter (an aircraft combining the principles of helicopters and bird-like aircraft) he built, flew by his own muscle power and flew fifteen meters.

　　Soviet inventors pay close attention to the manufacture of ornithopters with light engines. In 1954, designer Monatskov's ornithopter glider made its first flight. As compressed air from the compressor burst out like accumulated wind, the glider's wings unfolded and flapped. This experiment solved many problems related to the manufacture of motor-powered ornithopters. In 1957, Odessa tested a wind-powered ornithopter model made by designer Silman. This model, weighing about six kilograms, flew fifteen meters high, made horizontal flights, and glided well.

　　Ilyin, a former pilot and now a middle school teacher in Babushkin near Moscow, is conducting interesting research on experimental ornithopter aircraft. He thoroughly studies the movement of membrane and elastic flapping wings, hoping to use a lightweight three-horsepower pocket engine to fly into the air.

　　Bicycle-style and motorcycle-style ornithopters are also being trial-produced throughout the Soviet Union. For example, designer Ferasov in Syzran is manufacturing an ornithopter using a twenty-horsepower motorcycle engine. (Su Zi)

　　让人像鸟一样飞翔
    许多世代的热心家们设计和制造了翅膀，企图利用自己肌肉的力量飞上天空，但他们的一切尝试都遭到了失败。
    最近科学和技术的成就提供了认真研究鸟类飞行规律和找出复制鸟类飞行方法的可能。新的塑料使人们能够制出特别轻巧和牢固的翅膀。在苏联已经展开了研究和制造扑翼机——一种有着两个扑动的翅膀的飞行器——的工作。是什么东西吸引设计师们来创造这种器械呢？
    只要说到下面一点，就可以想到扑翼机的实际好处了：它的提升力比普通飞机大三到四倍，比直升飞机则大七到九倍。这样优越的飞行质量使它能在发动机功率较小的条件下载运重得多的装载物。
    扑翼机可以不跑就起飞，并且能滑翔着陆，这是飞行安全最重要的条件之一。鸟式飞机不需要机场。它可以完全安全的做到滑翔手做不到的从悬岩上或屋顶上飞下来。扑翼飞机不会在螺旋飞行中损毁。
    扑翼飞机的经济性和安全性为建立新的、群众性的空运提供了可能。它可以像自行车和摩托车一样普遍。大批制造扑翼机，将能为滑翔运动、空中旅行和航空运动的发展开辟广阔的可能性。
    在苏联，有一个社会组织进行扑翼机的设计和创造工作，那就是陆海空军志愿支援协会中央航空俱乐部附属扑翼飞行委员会。这个委员会的成员包括航空动力学家、鸟类学家、航空设计师、试飞飞行家和青年学生。乌克兰、立陶宛、拉脱维亚和苏联其他加盟共和国里，都建立了扑翼飞行委员会分会。
    今年年初，莫斯科举行过一次扑翼飞行科学技术代表会议，有一百八十个人参加。用了五天的时间，讨论和总结了建造扑翼机方面所进行的研究和设计工作。
    已经获得的材料使在扑翼飞行方面工作的热心家们可以进而设法制造能飞的模型和真正的扑翼机了。实验家们分两方面进行实验：一方面建造用人的手或脚带动的飞行器，另一方面则建造使发动机旋转运动变成双翼挥扑运动的飞行器。
    扑翼机扑翼最早的式样是在苏联由设计师达特林用藤蔓和鲸须按照正式扑翼的尺寸做成的，达特林的扑翼非常有效。
    不久以前，业余发明家谢列布里亚可夫—节布利可夫在列宁格勒附近的谢斯特罗列茨卡市进行了脚踏扑翼机的试验。在每秒4—6米的风力下，他从一个小小的高地上向前飞了十米。在吉尔吉斯苏维埃社会主义共和国伏龙芝市，另一个教师兼发明家格拉波夫斯基坐着他制造的扑翼直升飞机（兼用直升飞机和鸟式飞机原理的飞行器）用自己肌肉的力量飞了起来，并且飞了十五米。
    苏联发明家们非常注意制造带轻发动机的扑翼机。1954年，设计师莫纳茨可夫的扑翼滑翔机作了第一次飞行。由于压气机里压缩空气像蓄着的风一样一阵阵冲出来，滑翔机的翅膀便舒展的挥动着。这一试验解决了许多有关制造摩托扑翼机的问题。1957年，敖德萨试验了设计师西尔曼制造的风动扑翼机模型。这只全重约六公斤的模型飞了十五米高，作了水平飞行，并且滑行情况良好。
    莫斯科附近巴布施金市的一位从前的飞行员、现在是中学教师的伊里英正在进行试验扑翼飞行器的有趣的研究工作。他彻底研究膜式和弹性扑翼的动作，希望利用轻巧的三马力袖珍发动机飞入空中。
    苏联各地也在试制自行车式和摩托车式的扑翼机。例如，塞兹兰市设计师费拉索夫正在制造采用二十马力摩托车发动机的扑翼机。　（苏资）
