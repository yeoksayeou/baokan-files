　　Jiangxi Masses Launch Winter Planting Overproduction Competition

    This dispatch from Nanchang, October 15th: To ensure an even greater bumper harvest of spring and summer crops next year, Jiangxi Province has launched a high tide of winter planting production competition. Currently, all localities are striving to complete and overfulfill their winter sowing plans, while also ensuring good planting and management to achieve multiple high-yield harvests.

    Jiangxi Province plans to sow a total of 29.5 million mu of various winter crops, an expansion of 3.9 million mu compared to last year. Guaranteeing multiple plantings, high yields, and multiple harvests of winter crops is a continuation of this year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture, and also the beginning of striving to achieve next year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture. Therefore, all localities attach great importance to winter planting work. After deeply studying the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of rural cadres and commune members unanimously proposed: "Don't relax for a moment, don't let go in any season, leap again and again, and strive for victory in winter planting!" Subsequently, a heated winter planting overproduction competition unfolded between counties, communes, and teams. Now, this wave of competition has swept across the entire province. Through establishing pace-setters and catching-up-with-the-advanced movements, the Yichun Special District saw mutual challenges and responses among all fifteen counties, launching a "three exceed" great competition of "rapeseed exceeding Yichun, green manure exceeding Pingxiang, and wheat exceeding Jinxian," which further increased the area and yield targets for winter planting. The planned winter planting area for the entire district was expanded by 118% compared to last year. Ten counties including Yichun, Pingxiang, and Wanzai have all proposed targets of exceeding 100 jin per mu for rapeseed, 200 jin per mu for wheat, and 7,000 jin per mu for green manure.

    Nanchang County is a high-yield green manure county. This year, it initiated a competition with Fengcheng, Xinjian, Linchuan, and Boyang, striving to become a county with a green manure yield of 10,000 jin per mu. Hukou County, the first rapeseed 100-jin county in Jiangxi Province, is redoubling its efforts to ensure that the yield of rapeseed per mu in the entire county leaps to over 150 jin.

    In the competition movement, all localities are focusing on increasing production measures. Counties and people's communes have continuously held winter planting technical training classes, symposiums, and mass field meetings with the participation of experienced farmers and technicians to summarize and formulate production-increasing technical measures for winter crops, and together with winter planting area and yield targets, have implemented them level by level to grassroots contracted production units and every plot of land.

    In order to plant winter crops on time, with good quality, and according to plan, all localities have now strengthened the leadership of winter planting, allocated appropriate labor forces, and are simultaneously seizing the sowing of green manure crops while preparing for the sowing of rapeseed, wheat, broad beans, and peas. Up to the present, according to incomplete statistics, 9.3 million mu of green manure have been sown in late rice fields and idle land in various places. In order to ensure the timely sowing of rapeseed, wheat, broad beans, and peas, all localities have launched a campaign to clear warehouses and check seeds, select and retain good seeds as early as possible, and carry out seed drying and treatment. Various tools for sowing, plowing, and land preparation are also being manufactured at an accelerated pace. In addition, all localities are also seizing the opportunity to vigorously accumulate and create fertilizer for winter planting. The "crash month" for preparing fertilizer for winter planting launched by various counties in Shangrao Special District is now progressing at an average rate of over 4 million dan of fertilizer accumulated per day.

### 江西群众大搞冬种超产竞赛

　　江西群众大搞冬种超产竞赛
    本报南昌15日电　为保证明年春夏季作物更大丰收，江西省掀起了冬种生产竞赛高潮。现在各地正力争完成和超额完成冬播计划，同时做到种好、管好，实现多种高产多收。
    江西省计划播种的各种冬种作物共二千九百五十万亩，比去年扩大三百九十万亩。保证冬种作物多种、高产、多收，是今年农业大跃进的继续，同时又是争取实现明年农业大跃进的开始。因此，各地对冬种工作都很重视，广大农村干部和社员在深入地学习中共八届八中全会决议的基础上，一致提出：一步不松，季季不放，一跃再跃，力夺冬种的胜利。接着，县与县、社与社、队与队之间展开了热烈的冬种超产竞赛。现在这个竞赛的热潮已经席卷全省。宜春专区通过立标兵、赶先进运动，全区十五个县相互挑战应战，展开了油菜超宜春、绿肥超萍乡、小麦超进贤的“三超”大竞赛，使冬种的面积和产量指标一再加码，全区冬种计划面积比去年扩大118％。宜春、萍乡、万载等十个县都提出要油菜亩产超百斤、小麦亩产二百斤、绿肥亩产七千斤的指标。
    南昌县是绿肥高产县，今年以争取实现绿肥亩产万斤县向丰城、新建、临川、波阳发起了竞赛。江西省第一个油菜百斤县——湖口县，再鼓干劲，保证全县油菜每亩产量跃进到一百五十斤以上。
    在竞赛运动中，各地大抓增产措施。各县和各人民公社都连续举办了有老农和技术人员参加的冬种技术训练班、座谈会，以及群众性的田头会，总结并制定了冬种作物的增产技术措施，连同冬种面积、产量指标逐级落实到了基层包产单位和每丘田地。
    为了按时、按质、按计划地种好冬季作物，现在各地都已加强了冬种的领导力量，调配了适当的劳动力，一面抓紧进行绿肥作物的播种，一面进行油菜、小麦和蚕、豌豆播种前的准备工作。到最近为止，据不完全统计，各地在晚稻田里和闲土空地中已播种绿肥九百三十万亩。为了保证油菜、大小麦和蚕、豌豆及时的播种，各地已经展开清仓查种运动，及早选留好种，进行种子翻晒处理；播种、翻田、整地用的各种工具也在加紧制造。此外，各地还抓紧为冬种大力积肥造肥。上饶专区各县开展的为冬种备肥突击月，现在每天积肥进度平均达四百万担以上。（马钟明）
