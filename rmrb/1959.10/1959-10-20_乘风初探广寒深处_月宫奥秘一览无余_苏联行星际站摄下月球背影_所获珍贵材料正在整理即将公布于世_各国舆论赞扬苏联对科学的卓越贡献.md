Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: The Soviet automatic interplanetary station has completed its first orbit around the Earth and the Moon. While circling the Moon, the automatic interplanetary station captured images of the far side of the Moon, which is invisible from Earth, and has transmitted them back to Earth. These images are currently being processed.

The chairman of the Lunar and Planetary Physical Conditions Research Committee of the Astronomical Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Mr. Barabashov, published an article in "Pravda" on the 19th, discussing the significant implications of this event. The article stated that we can only see about three-fifths of the Moon's surface. The remaining two-fifths are beyond our view and can only be seen from an interplanetary spacecraft. We have only had knowledge of the side of the Moon facing Earth. The other side has been completely unknown until today. Various hypotheses have existed regarding this. Some astronomers believe that there are very few seas on the far side of the Moon, and they are not large. Some believe that there is water, and even air, on the far side of the Moon. But this possibility is very small. Now Soviet scholars will have accurate scientific materials regarding this. Astronomers all over the world are eagerly awaiting the publication of the photographic results of the unseen far side of the Moon. Thanks to the labor of Soviet scholars, engineers, and workers, mankind will see for the first time in history the part that was previously considered invisible.

Based on the materials obtained, it will be possible to study the formation history and laws of the Moon's uneven surface in more detail. A possibility has now emerged to come closer to solving the question of the origin of the Moon and the geological processes that caused the formation of the lunar surface.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to TASS: At 19:50 (Moscow time) on October 18th, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station will complete its first orbit around the Earth.

The interplanetary station conducted scientific exploration of the cosmic space near the Earth and the Moon; while circling the Moon, it photographed the far side of the Moon, which is invisible from Earth.

The materials obtained from the scientific exploration and photography are being processed, and the results will be published. After the automatic interplanetary station completes its first orbit around the Earth, it will move further and further away from the Earth. It will not be visible in the Soviet Union for approximately two days and nights.

The next time the interplanetary station will transmit scientific materials is from 15:00 to 16:00 Moscow time on October 21st. At this time, the automatic interplanetary station will be nearly 327,000 kilometers away from the Earth, and its coordinates above the Earth's surface will be: 38 degrees east longitude, 23 degrees south latitude.

This newspaper’s comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in various countries attaches great importance to the news that the Soviet interplanetary station photographed the far side of the Moon.

Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic published the news that the Soviet automatic interplanetary station successfully completed its first orbit around the Moon and photographed the far side of the Moon on the 19th in prominent positions.

"Neues Deutschland" wrote that for two weeks, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station has used radio signals to send back to Earth some extremely valuable materials about the space around the Earth and the Moon.

"Tribune" believes that the Soviet automatic interplanetary station's photographing of the far side of the Moon is the greatest experiment in human history.

"Junge Welt" said that this event is an outstanding contribution made by the Soviet Union to science.

Japanese scientists and newspapers have published comments one after another, unanimously believing that the development of Soviet science and technology is very rapid.

Professor Miyamoto, a famous Japanese scientist, said, "I am very happy to hear that the Soviet interplanetary station photographed the far side of the Moon." He said: "This is a great achievement in human history."

Professor Miyaji, director of the Tokyo Observatory, said that the launch of the Soviet third cosmic rocket is a brilliant scientific achievement.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" wrote that the research work carried out by the automatic interplanetary station proves the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists.

"Asahi Weekly" wrote that while launching cosmic rockets, the Soviet Union has also achieved new achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and has built the world's first atomic icebreaker.

The Vice-Chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, Mr. Gatland, said that the fact that the Soviet third lunar rocket photographed the "backside" of the Moon is "remarkable".

He said: "After correctly launching a probe to a place very close to the Moon, and then entering the path that returns it close to the Earth, that is especially 'remarkable'."

He went on to say: "One might suggest that the US Air Force attempted several times last year to shoot a probe into orbit around the Moon, and the probe also carried a camera. But they failed several times, and of course the camera was also useless."

West Germany's "Neue Rhein Zeitung" wrote on the 19th while reporting on the operation of the Soviet third cosmic rocket: The dreams of generations of mankind have been realized. For the first time, a photograph of the far side of the Moon has been taken, and this was taken by the Soviet "third little moon."

Other newspapers in West Germany also reported on this new achievement of Soviet science and technology with great length.

According to the "Westfälische Rundschau", the Bochum Observatory received radio signals from the Soviet automatic interplanetary station when it was close to Earth.

### 乘风初探广寒深处　月宫奥秘一览无余  苏联行星际站摄下月球背影  所获珍贵材料正在整理即将公布于世  各国舆论赞扬苏联对科学的卓越贡献

　　乘风初探广寒深处　月宫奥秘一览无余
    苏联行星际站摄下月球背影
    所获珍贵材料正在整理即将公布于世  各国舆论赞扬苏联对科学的卓越贡献
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联自动行星际站已绕完地球和月球第一圈。在绕过月球时，自动行星站已摄取了在地球上看不见的月球的另一面的照片，并已发送到地球上，目前正在整理中。
    苏联科学院天文学委员会月球和行星物理条件研究委员会主席巴拉巴绍夫19日在“真理报”上发表文章，谈到了这件事的重大意义。文章说，我们只能看到月球表面的五分之三左右，其余五分之二处在我们视线之外，只有从行星际飞船上才能看到它。我们一直只有月球向着地球这一面的知识，它的另一面在今天以前毫无所知。在这方面存在着各种假设。有些天文学家认为，月球的另一面海很少，而且面积不大。有人认为，在月球另一面有水，甚至有空气。但这种可能性是很小的。现在苏联学者手中将拥有关于这方面的精确科学材料了。全世界天文学家正在急不可待地等待着人们所看不见的月球另一面的摄影结果的公布。由于苏联学者、工程师和工人的劳动，人类将在历史上第一次看到过去认为从来看不到的那一部分。
    在已获得的材料基础上，将能更详细地研究月球凹凸面的形成的历史和规律。现在已经出现了一种可能，使解决有关月球的起源的问题和解决有关引起月球表面形成的地质过程的问题的时候，更加接近了。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社讯：10月18日十九时五十分（莫斯科时间），苏联自动行星际站将完成绕地球的第一周运转。
    行星际站对地球和月球附近的宇宙空间进行了科学考察；在绕过月球时，对地球上看不见的月球背面进行了摄影。
    正在对科学考察和摄影所获得的材料进行整理，整理后的结果将予公布。自动行星际站完成绕地球的第一周运转后，将离地球越来越远。苏联境内大约有两昼夜的时期将看不到它。
    行星际站下次发送科学材料的时间是莫斯科时间10月21日十五时到十六时。这时，自动行星际站将距离地球将近三十二万七千公里，它在地球表面上空的座标是：东经三十八度，南纬二十三度。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论重视苏联行星际站拍摄到月球背面照片的消息。
    德意志民主共和国的报纸19日用显著的地位刊登了苏联自动行星际站胜利完成绕月球的第一圈飞行，并拍摄了月球背面照片的消息。
    “新德意志报”写道，两周以来，苏联自动行星际站利用无线电讯号向地面发回了若干关于地球、月球周围空间的极其珍贵的材料。
    “论坛报”认为，苏联自动行星际站拍摄了月球背面的照片，这是人类历史上最巨大的实验。
    “青年世界报”说，这一事件是苏联对科学所作出的卓越功绩。
    日本科学家和报纸纷纷发表评论，一致认为苏联科学技术的发展是非常迅速的。
    日本著名科学家宫本教授说，我很高兴地听到，苏联行星际站拍摄了月球背面的照片。他说：“这是人类历史上的伟大成就。”
    东京天文台台长宫地教授说，苏联第三个宇宙火箭的发射是辉煌的科学成就。
    “读卖新闻”写道，自动行星际站进行的研究工作证明了苏联科学家的出色成就。
    “朝日周报”写道，苏联在发射宇宙火箭的同时，在和平利用原子能方面也取得了新的成就，第一个在世界上建造成了原子破冰船。
    英国星际协会副主席加特兰德说：苏联第三个月球火箭拍摄到月球“背面”情况的照片这件事是“了不起的”。
    他说：“在正确地发射一个探索器到非常接近月球地方以后，再进入它回到靠近地球的那条道路，那格外是“了不起的。”
    他接着说：“人们可能提出，美国空军在去年曾几次企图把探索器射入围绕月球的轨道，探索器上也曾携有摄影器。但是，他们几次都失败了，摄影器当然也归于无用。”
    西德的“新来因报”19日在报道苏联第三个宇宙火箭运行情况时写道：人类世世代代的梦想实现了。第一次拍摄到月球背面的照片，这是苏联的“第三号小月亮”拍摄的。
    西德其他报纸也用很大篇幅报道了苏联科学技术的这一新成就。
    据“威斯特伐利亚评论报”报道，在苏联自动行星际站靠近地球时，波鸿天文台收到了它的无线电讯号。
