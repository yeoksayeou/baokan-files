Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Our correspondent reports: Prominent Chinese cultural figures and artists from the Soviet State Bolshoi Theatre Ballet Company gathered at the Overseas Chinese Mansion today at noon to celebrate the prosperity and flourishing of the great socialist cultures of China and the Soviet Union.

At 1:00 PM, the ballet company's artists arrived at the venue. Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, Chen Kehan, Lin Mohan, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Yang Hansheng, Vice Chairmen of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Zhixiang and Qu Wu, and others greeted the arrival of their Soviet friends with beaming smiles. Famous writers, poets, playwrights, dancers, musicians, artists, and actors stepped forward with smiles, accompanying their counterparts to their seats.

After a burst of warm applause subsided, Shen Yanbing delivered a speech welcoming the guests. He said, "What we are holding here today is both a tea party and a social gathering. Some of us are old friends, and some have just forged deep friendships. Let us take this opportunity to drink and talk to our hearts' content." At that moment, applause rolled across the venue like thunder.

The head of the ballet company, Arkhipenko, excitedly stood up and spoke.

Deep friendship closely linked the people together. The emotions of the hosts and guests blended like milk and water. Mei Lanfang and Tian Han spoke with Ulanova to their hearts' content.

The poet Yuan Shuipai recited a poem he had written for Ulanova on the spot, wishing the Soviet ballet master eternal youth. The old painter Jiang Zhaohe painted a traditional Chinese ink portrait for Ulanova, and Ulanova signed the painting with ink. The painters Ye Qianyu and Yu Feng were even busier, painting portraits for many Soviet artists. Playwright Tian Han wrote a poem and presented it to all the comrades of the ballet company. In this joyous gathering of friendship, Xiao San, Zhao Shuli, Lao She, Dai Ailian, Lü Ji, Ma Sicong, Ouyang Yuqian, Chen Qitong, Cai Chusheng, Xiao Bai Yushuang, and Li Shaochun, among others, all had hearty conversations with the Soviet artists.

    据新华社10日讯　本社记者报道：著名的中国文化界人士和苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团的艺术家们今天中午欢聚在华侨大厦，共庆中苏两国伟大的社会主义文化的昌盛和繁荣。

    沈雁冰在一阵热烈的掌声平息以后致词欢迎客人。他说，我们今天在这里举行的是茶话会也是联欢会。有的人早就是老朋友，有的人刚结下了深交，让我们借这个机会尽情地畅饮深谈吧。这时候，掌声像春雷似的卷过了会场。
    芭蕾舞团团长阿列欣科兴奋地起立讲了话。
