Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower said yesterday at a press conference in Washington that he was as willing as before to meet with the heads of government of other Western countries at any time and in any place in order to find a common Western position before holding a top-level meeting with the Soviet Union.

Eisenhower said that the heads of government of Britain, West Germany, and France had also expressed their willingness to hold such a meeting in mid-December.

He said that his personal view was that the heads of Western governments should hold a preliminary meeting on the issue of adopting a common position before December. At the same time, Eisenhower hinted that he agreed to postpone such a meeting. He said that the common "desire" of the heads of Western governments to hold talks should not be interpreted as a certainty that such talks would be held in mid-December.

A reporter asked Eisenhower what his attitude was toward West German Chancellor Adenauer's position that the upcoming top-level meeting with the Soviet Union should be limited to discussing disarmament issues and should not involve the German question. Eisenhower replied that it was not yet certain how the agenda of the top-level meeting should be. He said that progress on disarmament would be a step towards easing international tensions and ensuring peace. He also said that he did not understand how disarmament could be seriously discussed if the German question was not mentioned.

On the issue of disarmament, the U.S. President repeated his past statement that any agreement on disarmament should be predicated on resolving the issue of establishing a monitoring system.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: According to Western news agency reports, the French and British governments expressed different opinions on the issue of convening an East-West summit meeting yesterday.

The French government's statement on foreign policy in parliament emphasized that, in principle, the French government has never opposed convening an East-West summit meeting. However, the French government still "believes that next spring will definitely be a suitable time to hold a summit meeting."

Since the French government's communique on the 21st advocated postponing the summit meeting to next spring, it has been criticized by many Western countries (especially Britain) newspapers.

The French government's statement, referring to Khrushchev's invitation to visit France, said that this visit "is indispensable for the future of the summit meeting, and this visit will be extremely beneficial no matter what." The statement also announced that West German Chancellor Adenauer will visit France on December 1st and hold talks with de Gaulle.

On the same day, British Prime Minister Macmillan said at the opening meeting of the new British Parliament that the British government "hopes to hold a summit meeting as soon as possible." British government spokesmen said after the French government's communique on the 21st that Britain had always believed that the summit meeting should be held before next spring.

Macmillan attempted to imply that Britain was more active than the United States in convening an East-West summit meeting. He said that Eisenhower only agreed to hold a Western summit meeting as soon as possible, followed by an East-West summit meeting, after Khrushchev's visit to the United States.

Macmillan avoided directly addressing France's attitude. However, Reuters quoted British sources as saying that the views of the British and French governments were "extremely contradictory."

    在召开最高级会议问题上
    美英法各有打算态度不一
    艾森豪威尔强调西方首脑要先找到共同立场
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上说，他像从前一样愿意在任何时间和任何地点同其他西方国家政府首脑会谈，以便在举行有苏联参加的最高级会议之前找到西方共同的立场。
    艾森豪威尔说，英国、西德和法国政府首脑也表示愿意在12月中旬举行这种会谈。
    他说，他个人的看法是，西方国家政府首脑应该在12月以前就采取共同立场问题举行预备会议。同时，艾森豪威尔暗示，他同意推迟这种会谈。他说，不应该把西方国家政府首脑举行会谈的共同“愿望”解释成为这种会谈肯定要在12月中旬举行。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，西德总理阿登纳认为，即将召开的有苏联参加的最高级会议应当只限于讨论裁军问题，而不涉及到德国问题，他对阿登纳的这种立场抱什么态度。艾森豪威尔回答说，现在还不能肯定说最高级会议的议程应当如何。他说，在裁军问题上获得进展将是走向缓和国际紧张局势和保障和平的步骤。他又说，他不明白，如果德国问题不有所提及，如何能认真地讨论裁军问题。
    在裁军问题上，美国总统重复了他过去的说法，即有关裁军问题的任何协议，都应当以解决建立监督系统的问题为前提。
    据新华社28日讯　据西方通讯社消息，法国和英国政府昨天在同一天内就召开东西方最高级会议问题发表了态度不同的意见。
    法国政府在议会中发表的有关外交政策的声明强调，在原则上，法国政府从来不反对召开东西方最高级会议。但是，法国政府仍然“认为明年春天肯定是举行最高级会议的合适的时间”。
    自从21日法国政府发表的公报主张把最高级会议拖延到明年春天举行以来，它一直遭到许多西方国家（特别是英国）的报纸的指责。
    法国政府的声明谈到赫鲁晓夫将应邀访法时说，这一访问“对于举行最高级会议的前途是不可缺少的，这一访问无论怎样将是极为有益的”。声明还宣布，西德总理阿登纳将在12月1日到法国访问并同戴高乐会谈。
    同一天，英国首相麦克米伦在英国新议会开幕会议上说，英国政府“希望尽早举行最高级会议”。英国政府发言人在法国政府21日的公报发表后曾说，英国始终认为最高级会议应在明年春季以前举行。
    麦克米伦企图暗示英国对召开东西方最高级会议比美国积极。他说，在赫鲁晓夫访美后，艾森豪威尔才赞成尽早举行西方最高级会议，并随即举行东西方最高级会议。
    麦克米伦避不直接谈到法国的态度。但是路透社引用英国人士的话认为，英法两国政府的意见“极为相反”。
