　　The Eagles on the Motherland's Seas
　　——After Watching the Film "Sea Eagle"

　　More than a year ago, the storm stirred up by the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in the Taiwan Strait is still vivid in our minds. Today, seeing the film "Sea Eagle," which reflects the heroic struggle of our People's Navy in the Jinmen naval battle, we feel particularly close and delighted.
　　We clearly remember that at that time, the US imperialists vainly attempted to ignite a war of provocation at the southeastern gateway of our country. Seventh Fleet Commander Bilek clamored arrogantly: his fleet was "ready to expand the war at any time." After being severely punished by our powerful artillery fire, the Chiang's army on Jinmen Island shamelessly relied on the escort of the US fleet; thinking that this would break through our army's blockade... The story of the film "Sea Eagle" unfolds in such a complex and contradictory reality. Through the mouth of Chiang's army Captain Sun, the film reveals their wishful thinking: "This time, when the Allied forces arrive at the Jinmen sea, they will show the Communists a thing or two. If we fight, it won't work... if we don't fight, we can't get off the stage..." Another cunning Captain Li revealed the contradictions between the US and Chiang, expressing doubt about the "Allied forces"' loyalty and reliability. Then, the film vividly shows the US warships fleeing in panic under the bombardment of our army's artillery fire. When we saw US Colonel James shouting the order "Return" with sweat all over his face, and our torpedo boat squadron leader Zhang Min shouting "Full speed ahead," it was truly heartening! This "Full speed ahead" is the voice of the real master of the motherland's seas, a voice that makes the sea robbers tremble. The US imperialist paper tiger was once again exposed by the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait, and the US imperialists put a noose around their own necks.
　　What is particularly touching is that, through this thrilling naval battle, the film shows the heroism of the officers and soldiers of the People's Navy. When the torpedo boat squadron returned victoriously after sinking the enemy's transport ship, one of the boats, 909, was hit by enemy fire, its communication was cut off, and the hull quickly sank. At this time, the captain of the last enemy ship shouted wildly: "Take them alive! Surrender!" Unfortunately, the enemy was blind. Our torpedo boat squadron leader Zhang Min promptly ordered the torpedo man to manually launch the last torpedo, answering the enemy's shameless clamor. As boat 909 gradually sank, when the sea water reached their waists, the sailors looked at their beloved torpedo boat with reluctance and solemnly lowered the five-star red flag. Zhang Min said with heroic tears, "Comrades, don't be sad. Now we have lowered the national flag, and tomorrow on the new boat, we will raise it even higher!" This boundless love and loyalty to the motherland made them brave and tenacious in battle, and still full of confidence when leaving the boat.
　　The predicament of drifting at sea for dozens of hours, and the life-and-death struggle at sea, made the noble qualities of the characters in the film shine like gold. When the seriously injured engine room chief Liu Tao asked his comrades not to worry about him, Zhang Min immediately announced the convening of an enlarged party group meeting. The wind and waves were howling, and there were only nine of them in the vast sea, but the voice of the Party resounded here. Zhang Min said loudly: "Comrades, we are a whole on the boat, and we are also a whole in the water. We came out together, and we must go back together!... The Party requires us to return victoriously, and no matter how big the storm is, it cannot stop us from moving forward!" When Liu Tao was shivering with cold, Zhang Min used his own body to warm his comrade's body; the life jacket of gunner Xiao Ma was broken, and the squadron leader immediately took off his own life jacket and insisted that he wear it... It is the strength of the Party and the strength of the collective that makes this group of sea eagles never break their wings.
　　The film reflects Chairman Mao's strategic thinking on people's war from beginning to end. Whether it is coastal artillery operations or naval vessel operations, we can see the supporting role of the masses, especially the maritime militia. This not only reflects the reality of severely punishing the Chiang army in Jinmen, but more importantly, it shows the essence of the People's Army.
　　Our People's Navy is still very young, but under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and together with fraternal units, it has undergone many combat tests and has proven itself worthy of being a group of eagles on the motherland's seas. The film "Sea Eagle" reflects this essential aspect, and it should be said that it is a gratifying achievement.

　　祖国海洋上的雄鹰
　　——影片“海鹰”观后
　　卢连春　裴俊有
    一年多以前，美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派在台湾海峡掀起的风浪犹历历在目，今天，看到了反映金门海战中我们人民海军英勇斗争的影片——“海鹰”，感到特别亲切和喜悦。
    我们清楚地记得，当时美帝国主义妄图在我国东南大门口燃起挑衅的战火，第七舰队司令比利克狂妄叫嚣：他的舰队已经为“随时扩大战争作好了准备”。金门岛上的蒋军在遭到我强大的炮火严惩之后，无耻地依靠美国舰队护航；以为这样就可以冲破我军的封锁……。影片“海鹰”的故事正是在这样错综复杂的现实矛盾中展开的。影片通过蒋军孙舰长的口，说出了他们的如意算盘：“这次盟军一到金门海面，就要共产党个好看，打也不行……不打吧，又下不来台……”另一个老奸巨猾的李舰长又道出了美蒋的矛盾，对“盟军”的忠实可靠表示怀疑。接着，影片生动地表现了美国军舰在我军炮火轰击下仓惶逃窜的狼狈相。当看到美军上校詹姆斯吓得满脸虚汗地喊出“返航”的口令，而我军鱼雷艇中队长张敏高呼“全速前进”的场面的时候，的确是人心大快的！这一声“全速前进”，是祖国海洋上的真正主人的声音，是使海上强盗听了发抖的声音。美帝国主义这只纸老虎，在台湾海峡又一次被中国人民戳穿了，美帝国主义者拿绞索套住了自己的脖子。
    特别感人的是，影片通过这场惊心动魄的海战，表现了人民海军官兵的英勇。鱼雷艇队在击沉敌人运输舰之后胜利返航时，其中909艇被敌舰炮火击中，电讯中断，艇身迅速下沉。这时，最后一艘敌舰舰长狂叫着：“抓活的！投降吧！”可惜敌人有眼无珠，我鱼雷艇中队长张敏及时命令鱼雷兵用手击发射出了最后一支鱼雷，回答了敌人的无耻叫嚣。这时909艇渐往下沉，当海水浸到他们腰部的时候，水兵们恋恋不舍地看着自己亲爱的鱼雷艇，庄严地降下了五星红旗。张敏含着英雄的眼泪，高声地说：“同志们，别难过，现在我们降下了国旗，明天在新艇上，我们要把它更高地升起来！”这种对祖国的无限热爱和忠诚，使他们在战斗中英勇顽强，在离艇时仍然信心百倍。
    数十小时海上漂游的困境，历尽艰险的海上生死斗争，使影片中人物的崇高品质闪现出金子一样的光辉。当受重伤的轮机长刘涛要求同志们别管他的时候，张敏立即宣布召开一个党小组扩大会。风浪在呼啸着，茫茫的大海里只有他们九个人，可是，这里却响彻着党的声音。张敏大声地说：“同志们，我们在艇上是一个整体，在水里也是一个整体。我们一起出来，也要一起回去！……党要求我们胜利返航，再大的风浪也挡不住我们前进！”当刘涛冻得浑身发抖的时候，张敏用自己的身体去温暖战友的身体；枪炮手小马的救生衣被打破了，中队长立即把自己的救生衣脱下来一定让他穿上……。正是党的力量，集体的力量，才使这群海鹰永远不会折断翅膀。
    影片自始至终反映了毛主席的人民战争的战略思想。不论是海岸炮作战或是舰艇作战，都可以看出人民群众、特别是海上民兵的支援作用。这不仅反映了严惩金门蒋军战斗的现实，而且更主要的是表现了人民军队的本质。
    我们人民海军还很年青，但是在党和毛主席领导下，和兄弟部队一起，经历了多次战斗考验，已经证明无愧为祖国海洋上的一群雄鹰。影片“海鹰”正是反映了这个本质方面，应该说是可喜的收获。
