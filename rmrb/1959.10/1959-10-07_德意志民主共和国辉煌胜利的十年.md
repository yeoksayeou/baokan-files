    Ten Years of Glorious Victory of the German Democratic Republic
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, a brotherly country born in the same year and month as our own. The people of our country, along with the people of all socialist countries, are celebrating this glorious festival with the people of the German Democratic Republic, congratulating them on the brilliant achievements they have made in the past ten years in maintaining peace, building socialism, and striving for the reunification of their motherland on the basis of peace and democracy.
    After the great Soviet army crushed the Nazi rule, a new page was opened in German history. After the war, the Soviet Union strictly fulfilled the Potsdam Agreement, implemented a series of democratic reforms in the Soviet occupation zone, eliminated monopoly capital, war criminals, and the landlord class, so that this region of Germany could develop along the democratic path. However, Western countries, headed by the United States, actively supported West German militarism and engaged in conspiracies to split Germany. On September 20, 1949, the United States, Britain, and France illegally merged their occupation zones and established the Federal Republic of Germany, completely dividing Germany. Under these circumstances, on October 7, 1949, the German people in the Soviet occupation zone, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, established the German Democratic Republic as a response to the Western countries' division of Germany. The birth of the first worker-peasant state in German history marked a turning point in German and European history.
    Our people are deeply pleased with the great achievements made by the people of the German Democratic Republic in the past ten years. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German people, in a short historical period, have transformed the eastern region of Germany, which was once the source of two world wars, into a fortress for maintaining European peace, and have established a solid foundation for the magnificent socialist edifice on this land. The ideals of Marx and Engels have blossomed and borne fruit for the first time on the land of their own motherland. As sung in the national anthem of the German Democratic Republic: "The sun has never shone so beautifully, illuminating Germany."
    From the first day of its founding, the German Democratic Republic has been building according to socialist principles. Over the past ten years, it has made tremendous achievements in this regard. The national economy of the German Democratic Republic has been developing rapidly. By the end of the first five-year plan in 1955, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic had more than doubled compared to the pre-war year of 1936. The second five-year plan, which began in 1956, is also being implemented smoothly. In 1958, the German Democratic Republic achieved new and significant successes in socialist construction and socialist transformation: total industrial output value increased by 10.9% compared to 1957, and the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives increased by 42% compared to 1957, now accounting for 40.9% of the country's total cultivated land area. In the first half of this year, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic increased by another 12.4% compared to the same period last year. By the end of this year, the people of the German Democratic Republic will have completed the total output value targets of the second five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. The industrial output of the German Democratic Republic ranks fifth in Europe and seventh in the world. The absolute output of lignite ranks first in the world, and the output of the chemical industry and electricity, calculated per capita, ranks second and fifth in the world, respectively. The absolute output of uranium ranks first in Europe. Today, the German Democratic Republic is already one of the major industrial countries in Europe. With the rapid development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the people of the German Democratic Republic has also been significantly improved.
    The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held last July, put forward the main economic tasks of the German Democratic Republic for the next three years: by the end of 1961, the German Democratic Republic should catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of important food and consumer goods. Recently, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic adopted the seven-year plan (1959-1965) for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. The main task of this plan is to maximize the scientific and technological level, labor productivity, and output of all industrial sectors, while minimizing production costs as much as possible in order to create a material and technical basis for the victory of socialism. The plan stipulates that from 1958 to 1965, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 88%. Over the next seven years, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises will increase by 85%. In agriculture, agricultural and livestock production will be rapidly increased on the basis of large-scale socialist production.
    This magnificent plan is a plan for peace, a program for the complete victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic. The realization of this seven-year plan will be a new and important contribution of the German Democratic Republic in the peaceful competition between the socialist camp and the capitalist countries. As Comrade Ulbricht pointed out, the realization of this magnificent program will have a profound impact on consolidating European peace and resolving the national tasks of the German people.
    The history of the German Democratic Republic is a history of safeguarding European and world peace, opposing imperialist policies of aggression and war. After the war, Western countries, headed by the United States, brutally violated the Potsdam Agreement, consistently insisted on dividing Germany and rearming West Germany, and dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Currently, West Germany is playing an increasingly important role in this aggressive bloc and has become a base for conducting the Cold War and launching atomic warfare. For ten years, the German Democratic Republic has stood at the forefront of the socialist camp, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, resolutely opposing the aggressive policies and war policies of the United States; and has waged unremitting struggles to ease European tensions, to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and to reunify Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. The just struggle of the German Democratic Republic has been warmly supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The German Democratic Republic has become a strong fortress for maintaining European peace and an important force against the Western aggressive forces launching war in Europe.
    The peace-loving German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship with all countries. Its international ties are constantly expanding and strengthening; its international prestige is also constantly increasing. Although Western countries, headed by the United States, have been clamoring about not recognizing the German Democratic Republic, not long ago, at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France had to sit down with the foreign minister of the German Democratic Republic to discuss issues related to Germany. This fact powerfully demonstrates that the existence of the German Democratic Republic and the increasingly important role it plays in international affairs cannot be denied by international reactionaries.
    The great achievements of the German Democratic Republic over the past ten years have been achieved by the heroic people of the German Democratic Republic under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, guiding the people of the German Democratic Republic onto the socialist road. It constantly cares about the connection between the Party and the masses, carries out socialist construction and socialist transformation, and persists in the struggle against West German militarism. At the same time, it follows the spirit of the declaration of the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, and is committed to enhancing the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The successive births of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are events of important historical significance in Asia and Europe. For ten years, our two peoples, in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, have forged an eternal and unbreakable friendship on the basis of common ideals and common goals. For ten years, the friendly relations between our two countries have been constantly consolidated and developed. The "Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation" concluded in 1955 is an important milestone in the development of the friendly relations between our two countries. Our two peoples, standing at the eastern and western outposts of the socialist camp, have waged a common struggle to safeguard world peace. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic against West German militarism and for the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. Our two countries also help each other and cooperate in the cause of building socialism, and advance side by side. Over the past ten years, the German Democratic Republic has dispatched excellent experts, provided many equipment, and vigorously supported our country's socialist construction. The people of our country express their heartfelt gratitude for this!
    The Chinese people have just celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and are now happily celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people regard the victory of the German people as our own victory, and regard the festival of the German people as our own festival. Let us cheer for the great victory achieved by the German Democratic Republic in the past ten years! We wish the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic a thousand miles a day! We wish the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and German peoples would last forever! May the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union be as constant as the sun and the moon, and as solid as a rock!

    德意志民主共和国辉煌胜利的十年
    今天是和我国同年同月诞生的兄弟国家德意志民主共和国成立的十周年。我国人民同所有社会主义国家人民都和德意志民主共和国人民一起，欢庆这个光荣的节日，祝贺德意志民主共和国人民十年来在维护和平、建设社会主义和在和平民主的基础上争取重新统一祖国的斗争中所取得的辉煌成就。
    伟大的苏联军队粉碎了纳粹的统治以后，德国历史开始了新的一页。战后，苏联严格履行波茨坦协定，在苏联占领区内实行一系列民主改革，消除了垄断资本、战争罪犯和地主阶级，以便德国这一地区能够沿着民主的道路发展。但是，以美国为首的西方国家却积极扶植西德军国主义和进行分裂德国的阴谋活动。1949年9月20日，美、英、法三国又非法合并了他们的占领区，并且成立德意志联邦共和国，使德国完全陷于分裂状态。在这种情况下，1949年10月7日，苏联占领区内的德国人民，在德国统一社会党的领导下，成立了德意志民主共和国，作为西方国家分裂德国的答复。德国历史上第一个工农国家的诞生，标志着德国历史和欧洲历史的转折点。
    我国人民深深为德意志民主共和国人民在过去十年中所建立的伟大的功勋感到高兴。德国人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，在短短的历史时期里，使曾经是两次世界大战策源地的德国的东部地区变成维护欧洲和平的堡垒，并且在这块土地上建立起宏伟的社会主义大厦的牢固基础。马克思和恩格斯的理想第一次在自己祖国的大地上开花结实。正如德意志民主共和国国歌中所歌颂的：“太阳从来没有这样美丽，照耀着德意志”。
    德意志民主共和国从成立的第一天起，就按照着社会主义原则进行建设。十年来，在这方面已取得了巨大的成就。德意志民主共和国的国民经济一直在迅速发展。1955年第一个五年计划结束时，德意志民主共和国的工业总产值已比战前1936年增加了一倍以上。从1956年开始的第二个五年计划也在顺利地执行。1958年，德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设和社会主义改造方面又取得新的重大成绩：工业总产值比1957年增加10.9％，农业生产合作社的耕地面积比1957年增加42％，现在已占全国耕地面积的40.9％。今年上半年，德意志民主共和国的工业生产又比去年同期增加12.4％。今年年底，德意志民主共和国人民将提前一年完成第二个五年计划总产值指标。德意志民主共和国的工业产量在欧洲占第五位，在世界占第七位，褐煤的绝对产量占世界第一位，化学工业产量和电力产量按人口平均计算分别占世界第二位和第五位，铀的绝对产量占欧洲第一位。今天，德意志民主共和国已是欧洲的主要工业国家之一。随着国民经济的迅速发展，德意志民主共和国人民的物质和文化生活也已经获得了显著的提高。
    去年7月召开的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会提出了德意志民主共和国最近三年中主要的经济任务：到1961年底，德意志民主共和国在按人口平均计算的重要食品和消费品的消费量方面赶上和超过西德。最近，德意志民主共和国人民议院通过了德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划（1959—1965年）。这个计划的主要任务是：最高限度地提高工业各部门的科学技术水平、劳动生产率和产量，同时尽可能地减少生产费用以便为社会主义的胜利创造物质和技术基础。计划规定，从1958到1965年，德意志民主共和国的工业生产将增加88％。在今后七年中，国营工业企业的劳动生产率将提高85％。在农业方面，将在大规模社会主义生产的基础上迅速增加农产品和畜产品的产量。
    这个宏伟的计划是和平的计划，是社会主义在德意志民主共和国获得完全胜利的纲领。这个七年计划的实现，将是德意志民主共和国在社会主义阵营同资本主义国家的和平竞赛中新的重要贡献。正如乌布利希同志指出的，这个宏伟的纲领的实现，将对巩固欧洲和平和解决德国人民的民族任务产生深刻的影响。
    德意志民主共和国的历史是一部维护欧洲和世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的历史。战后，以美国为首的西方国家粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，一贯坚持分裂德国和重新武装西德，并且把西德拉入北大西洋公约集团。目前，西德在这个侵略集团中正扮演着越来越重要的角色，并且成为进行冷战和发动原子战争的基地。十年来，德意志民主共和国站在社会主义阵营的前哨，同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起，坚决反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策；为缓和欧洲紧张局势，为争取缔结对德和约，并在和平民主的基础上重新统一德国进行了坚持不懈的斗争。德意志民主共和国的正义斗争，受到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈支持。德意志民主共和国已成为维护欧洲和平的坚强堡垒，成为反对西方侵略势力在欧洲发动战争的重要力量。
    爱好和平的德意志民主共和国，一贯执行着和平和同各国友好的政策。它的国际联系正在不断的扩大和加强；它的国际威望也在不断的提高。尽管以美国为首的西方国家一直叫嚣着不承认德意志民主共和国，可是，不久前在日内瓦外长会议上，美、英、法三国外长也不得不同德意志民主共和国外长一同坐下来讨论有关德国的问题。这一事实有力地说明了德意志民主共和国的存在和它在国际事务中所起的越来越重要的作用，是国际反动派所抹煞不了的。
    德意志民主共和国十年来的巨大成就，是英雄的德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党的领导下所取得的。德国统一社会党高举着马克思列宁主义旗帜，引导德意志民主共和国人民走上社会主义道路。它不断地关心党和群众的联系，进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，坚持反对西德军国主义的斗争。同时，它遵循社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议宣言的精神，致力于增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的先后诞生，是亚欧两洲具有重要历史意义的事件。十年来，我们两国人民，在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，在共同理想和共同目标的基础上，结成了永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。十年来，我们两国的友好关系不断巩固和发展。1955年缔结的“中德友好合作条约”，是我们两国友好关系发展的重要里程碑。我们两国人民站在社会主义阵营的东方和西方前哨，为维护世界和平曾进行了共同的斗争。中国人民坚决支持德意志民主共和国人民反对西德军国主义、争取在和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国的斗争。我们两国在建设社会主义的事业中也互助合作，并肩前进。十年来，德意志民主共和国派遣了优秀的专家，提供了许多设备，大力支援了我国的社会主义建设。我国人民对此表示衷心的感激！
    中国人民刚刚庆祝了中华人民共和国建国十周年，又欣逢德意志民主共和国建国十周年。中国人民把德国人民的胜利，看成我们自己的胜利，把德国人民的节日，看成自己的节日。让我们为德意志民主共和国的十年来所取得的伟大胜利而欢呼！祝德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业一日千里！祝中德两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青！祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结恒如日月，坚如磐石！
