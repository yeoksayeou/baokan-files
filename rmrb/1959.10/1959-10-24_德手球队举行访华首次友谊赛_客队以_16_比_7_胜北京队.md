Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Nearly ten thousand spectators in the capital watched the brilliant performance of the German Democratic Republic's national men's handball team, which is of world-class level, for the first time today. In the first friendly match of their visit to China, held at the Xiannongtan Stadium, the guest team defeated the Beijing men's handball team with a score of 16-7.

The German Democratic Republic's national men's handball team is the first foreign handball team to visit our country. The guest team was established in 1950 and has not been defeated since 1953, having competed in many countries. Among the fifteen players, seven are members of the All-German handball team that won the World Handball Championship this year. The players are tall and strong, run quickly, have diverse tactics, and shoot powerfully.

Handball is still an emerging sport in our country, only starting to develop in 1957. The Beijing handball team, which played against the guest team today, was the fourth-place winner of the First National Games. They played actively and tenaciously in the face of the experienced guest team.

The German Democratic Republic's national men's handball team will play against our country's handball champion, the People's Liberation Army handball team, in Beijing on the 25th.
