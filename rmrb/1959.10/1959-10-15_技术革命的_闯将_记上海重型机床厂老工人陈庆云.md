　　Technical Revolution's "Pioneer"
　　——Remembering Chen Qingyun, an Old Worker at the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant
　　Ding Hongyuan

　　In the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant, whenever Chen Qingyun is mentioned, everyone praises him by saying, "He is truly an old worker who can be described as constantly revolutionary, daring to speak and daring to act." Some people simply call him the "Pioneer" of the technical revolution.

　　Chen Qingyun is a worker in the assembly workshop and is over fifty years old this year. He has gray hair and slightly furrowed brows, as if he is always thinking. Over the years, he has made many suggestions for technical innovations. The following are just a few stories of major reforms he initiated.

　　Striving Day and Night to Produce a "Foreign Egg from a Native Chicken"

　　Last year, the factory accepted the task of trial-manufacturing a 4.5-meter vertical lathe. This vertical lathe was two stories high (7.5 meters), and the base and faceplate alone weighed more than ten tons each.

　　To prepare for manufacturing the 4.5-meter vertical lathe, the factory asked engineers to design a native vertical lathe to process the base and faceplate. However, the solution proposed by the engineers was "native" in name but actually foreign. Leaving aside other things, the pig iron alone would require thirty to forty tons, plus a fifty-horsepower motor and the processing of a faceplate with an outer diameter of more than five meters. Such a design was not only impossible due to the shortage of pig iron and motors at the time, but even processing the five-meter faceplate for this "native" vertical lathe was impossible to solve in the factory.

　　When Master Chen Qingyun heard that the factory was going to trial-manufacture such a large machine tool, he happily told everyone he met: "The bigger the machine tool is made, the stronger the country will be, and the heavier the responsibility of our workers will be." He knew the factory had the difficulty of not being able to process large machine tools without large equipment. No one asked him to solve this difficulty, but he took the initiative to use his brain. When he returned home, he picked up a pencil and drew on paper, but he couldn't draw it right, so he cut paper with scissors, pieced it together after cutting, and when eating, he held chopsticks and drew here and compared there; sometimes he held a few old parts and pieced them together like a child building blocks. In this way, he had a preliminary prototype of a native vertical lathe in his mind. When everyone at the meeting rejected the plan proposed by the engineers, Chen Qingyun expressed his own ideas, speaking while gesturing. However, the engineers shook their heads repeatedly after listening, and said coldly: "This kind of idea does not meet the standards. It is not only ugly in appearance, but even if it is successful, it can only be rough processed..." But everyone supported the "old man's" plan, and finally the factory director decided to give it a try.

　　Through everyone's hard work and ingenuity, a native vertical lathe was finally built. Four cement pillars were erected on the ground, and two intersecting I-beams were placed on top. A tool was installed in the central shaft hole of the 4.5-meter faceplate. The test officially began. As soon as the motor started, the car slowly rotated, and the "old man" kept his eyes fixed on the place where the tool passed. After a while, the car stopped, and people scrambled to watch the machined surface. "No, no, the smoothness does not meet the requirements," someone shouted in the crowd. The engineer bent down to look at the plane and shook his head and said, "I said long ago that this thing can only be roughly processed." Another group of workers at the scene supported Chen Qingyun, saying: "Rough processing can be done, and precision processing can definitely be done." The factory director then said: "Everything is difficult at the beginning, and success comes naturally. Old Chen, you must have the confidence to continue."

　　The first time failed. That night, Chen Qingyun tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep for a long time. He thought about the test run during the day, the native vertical lathe that the workers of the factory were looking forward to, and the encouragement from the factory director. He recalled what the responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee said at a municipal advanced producer representative conference: "As long as a person has confidence, any difficulty can be overcome. If it fails once, try again the second time. After several failures, it can be done eventually." He was not discouraged, on the contrary, he was more motivated and more confident. The next day, he and the young worker Shi Liansheng, like embroidery girls embroidering, carefully looked for the reasons without missing a stitch, so nervous that they didn't even bother to eat. They looked for "ways" from failure and repeatedly experimented, discovering that the angle of the tool was wrong, the screws were not tightened, and the tool arrangement was not correct, which affected the smoothness of the processing. After several adjustments and experiments, it finally succeeded. The smoothness of this native vertical lathe not only met the requirements after the test run, but also, when processing the base, it could both bore holes and cut up and down at the same time, reducing the handling process, shortening the processing time, and also saving metal materials for the country and reducing manufacturing costs. A foreign vertical lathe has more than 10,300 parts, weighs more than 60 tons, and costs about 500,000 yuan. This native vertical lathe has less than one hundred parts when put together, weighs less than 10 tons in total, and costs only 5,000 yuan, which is almost a hundred times different. Those superstitious views that simple equipment cannot manufacture heavy machine tools conceded defeat in the face of iron facts.

　　Daring to Think and Act to Break Through the Old "Fortress"

　　FA5 universal milling machines were assembled one after another. However, after leaving the factory and arriving at the new unit, they would have to ask the factory's old masters to repair them in a few days. The repair requests all said: "Oil circuit blockage, feed box seizure." The feed boxes being produced in the factory had several scrapped for every few made, and very few could meet the specifications. To solve this problem, a total of three hundred suggestions for improvement were put forward inside and outside the factory, before and after, but they were never completely resolved. The machine tools still failed the inspection, and the repair requests continued.

　　Chen Qingyun used to assemble feed boxes in this workshop. Later, due to work needs, he was transferred to work as a repairman. Although he left this workshop, he was always thinking about the quality problems of the "feed box."

　　One day, Chen Qingyun went to the assembly workshop as usual after get off work, and happened to see the workshop director worried about the fact that fourteen feed boxes were to be scrapped. As soon as Chen Qingyun entered the workshop, he bent down and, together with the workshop director, diagnosed the machine like a doctor diagnosing a patient, touching here and looking there, and listening to the machine's running sound with his ears against the machine. After listening for a while, Chen Qingyun raised his head and said to the workshop director: "This feed box cannot use oil pipes, and another oil circuit should be opened..."

　　Before he could finish speaking, someone next to him said: "How can you not use oil pipes? This is a foreign design!"

　　Based on his more than thirty years of repair experience, Chen Qingyun remained calm and said to the workshop director: "The oil circuit is like a person's meridians. If the meridians are not clear, the person will get sick; if the oil circuit is not clear, the machine cannot operate." He told the workshop director his plan to modify the oil circuit, which he had been thinking about for a long time. The workshop director nodded repeatedly. In order for Chen Qingyun to directly participate in this work, the Party decided to transfer him back to the assembly workshop. In order not to disappoint the Party's support and expectations, he was determined to take down this "fortress." So he thought hard at night and discussed with everyone during the day, repeatedly researching. After one failure, he tried again. After several experiments, another oil circuit was finally realized. The gears in the feed box rotated evenly, and the car oil flowed smoothly into the box. The old problem of more than two years was solved, and the shelved machine tools were put on the production post one by one.

　　Helping Others Demonstrates a High Style of Collaboration

　　Since the factory manufactured heavy machine tools, the manual operation of lifting and transportation was really too inconsistent. Moving a part required twelve or thirteen people, who laboriously rocked the hand-cranked car, sweat dripping from their bodies. It was not uncommon to spend half a day or a day moving it from the factory gate to the workshop, a distance of only a few hundred meters. The crane workers also wanted to carry out technical revolution, but they failed several times.

　　One day, Chen Qingyun passed by the crane team, and the crane worker Zhou Hongchuan said to him: "Help us think of a solution!" When Chen Qingyun saw this situation, he felt it was a problem, but if he wanted to help modify it, his current task was very heavy, and he couldn't spare any time day and night. When he remembered that the Party often told him to promote the communist spirit, he suddenly said to himself: "What's the difference between you and me, everyone is for socialism." In this way, he took this matter to heart very seriously. To mechanize the hand-crank, materials were needed. Chen Qingyun paid attention everywhere, and even when he went to the dining hall to eat, he squatted down and pondered for a long time when he encountered waste materials on the road. Once he found a set of old cranes that had been scrapped in the dark corner of the workshop. Master Chen picked it up like a treasure and took a look. Although the outside was not good, the inside was a complete set of "China Gate gearboxes." He happily said: "Isn't it just right to use it to modify the hand-cranked car?" Just then, a crane team came from another factory, and this crane team brought an electric hand-cranked car. After Chen Qingyun knew about it, he quickly ran to the rocker and watched it carefully, carefully. Suddenly a thought flashed through his mind: "Isn't it very good to modify the hand-cranked car according to this method?" So he discussed with Shi Liansheng, and the two of them started preparing. As long as they had free time, they ran around everywhere, almost turning over the dark corners of the entire workshop, looking for waste materials to use as substitutes. On March 5th of this year, in order to welcome the factory's Great Leap Forward Conference, he and Shi Liansheng fought hard all night and finally converted a hand-cranked car into an electric one. Now, as long as you press the button, the motor turns, and objects weighing dozens of tons run obediently like tamed tigers. However, Chen Qingyun was not satisfied with this. Recently, he also modified a hand truck for the transportation workers and modified a double-cylinder electric rocker. This rocker can top seven laborers and improve work efficiency. In this way, Chen Qingyun helped the lifting and transportation workers, who had been doing heavy labor, become relaxed and happy.

　　So, how were these achievements obtained? Over the years, in the process of countless technical innovation experiments—failure—re-experiment, and finally success, Chen Qingyun gained a deep understanding, that is, "resolutely follow the Party, listen to the Party, rely on the organization, rely on the masses, and all difficulties can be solved." He said: "The things in the world are all made by our workers, and the things made by the workers can be used. However, it is impossible to succeed in one attempt. As long as we resolutely rely on the Party and rely on the masses, if it fails once, try again the second time; if it fails twice, try again the third time, and there will always be one time when it will succeed. With such confidence, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome."

　　It was this belief that Chen Qingyun established that prompted him to constantly innovate.

　　技术革命的“闯将”
　　——记上海重型机床厂老工人陈庆云
    丁鸿元
    在上海重型机床厂，一提起陈庆云，大家就用赞美的口吻说：“他啊！真是一个称得上不断革命、敢说敢作的老工人”。有些人就干脆称呼他为技术革命的“闯将。”
    陈庆云是装配车间的工人，今年已经五十开外了。他，头发斑白，微皱着眉头，好像老是在动脑筋。几年来，他提出的技术革新建议很多。这里记述的只是几项进行重大改革的故事。
    日夜苦思“土鸡生洋蛋”
    去年，厂里接受了试制四米五立式车床的任务。这台立式车床有二层楼高（七米五），单单一只底座和花盘，就各有十几吨重。
    厂里为了做好制造四米五立车的准备工作，曾请工程师设计一台土立车来加工底座和花盘。但是工程师提出的方案，名义是“土”，实际还是洋的。别的不说，单生铁一项就要三、四十吨，还要五十马力的电动机和加工一只五米多外圆的花盘。这样的设计，不仅因为当时生铁原料和电动机都很缺乏，就是要加工这部“土”立车的五米花盘，在厂里也无法解决。　　陈庆云老师傅听说厂里要试制这样大的机床，乐呵呵地逢人就说：“机床做得越大，国家就越强，我们工人的责任也越重。”他知道厂里没有大设备不能加工大机床的困难，没有谁叫他解决这个困难，但是他主动地开动了脑筋。回到家里，他就拿起铅笔在纸上画，但是画来画去画不像，他就用剪刀剪纸，剪好后再拼起来，吃饭的时候，他握着筷子东画画西比比；有时拿着几个废旧零件，像小孩堆积木似地拼拼凑凑。这样，他的脑中初步有了一台土立车的雏形。当大家在会上否定了工程师提出的那个方案后，陈庆云就说出了自己的想法，他一边说，一边比划着。可是工程师听后，连连摇头，冷淡地说：“这种想法不合标准，不仅样子难看，即使成功也只能粗加工……”但大家都支持“老头”的方案，最后厂长决定试试看。
    经过大家的苦干、巧干，一台土立车终于造成功了。在地上竖起了四根水泥柱子，上边搁了两根交叉的工字铁，一把刀具安在四米五花盘的中心轴孔里。试验正式开始了。马达一开动，车子缓缓地转动起来，“老头”两只眼睛更紧紧地盯住了车刀车过的地方。不一会，车子停了下来，人们争着观看切削好的平面。“不行，不行，光洁度达不到要求”，人群里有人这样的叫喊。工程师弯下身子看了一下平面，也摇了摇头说：“我早就说过，这东西只能粗加工。”在场的另一部分工人，都支持着陈庆云说：“粗加工能行，精加工一定也能行”。厂长也接着说：“凡事开头难，功到自然成，老头，你要有信心继续搞下去”。
    第一次失败了。这一夜，陈庆云躺在床上翻来复去，久久不能入睡，他想着白天试车的情况，想着全厂工人期望着的那台土立车和厂长的鼓励。回想到自己在一次市先进生产者代表大会上，听市委负责同志说的“一个人只要有信心，任何困难都是可以克服的，一次搞不成，第二次再来，几次失败后，终能搞成的”。他并没有灰心，相反干劲更足了，信心更强了。第二天就和青年工人史连生一起，像绣花姑娘绣花，一针不漏地认真找原因，紧张得连饭都顾不上吃。他们从失败中找“门路”，反复试验，发现了刀的角度不对，螺丝没紧好，刀排装法不对头，而影响了加工的光洁度。几次的调整和试验终于成功了。这台土立车经过试车不仅光洁度达到要求，而且在加工底座时，既能搪眼，又能上下同时吃刀，减少了搬运的工序，缩短了加工时间，也为国家节省了金属材料，降低了制造成本。一台洋立车有一万零三百多个零件，重达六十多吨，成本约需五十万元。而这台土立车全部零件拼起来还不满一百件，总重量不到十吨，造价成本只有五千元，两者几乎相差一百倍。那些认为设备简陋不能制造重型机床的迷信观点，在铁的事实面前认输了。
    敢想敢作攻破老“堡垒”
    一台台FA5型万能铣床装配成了。可是，出厂后到了新单位，没几天就要请厂里老师傅去修理。一张张报修单上都是写着：“油路阻塞、走刀箱咬杀”。厂里在生产着的走刀箱，做几只报废几只，很少能合乎规格。为了解决这一问题，厂内厂外，前前后后共提出了三百多条改进意见，可是总没有彻底解决，机床照样检验通不过，检修单仍旧不断。
    陈庆云原来在这个车间装配走刀箱。后来因工作需要，调做检修工。他虽然离开了这个车间，但心里老是想着“走刀箱”的质量问题。
    一天，陈庆云下班后，照例到装配车间去，正好遇到车间主任在为十四只走刀箱要报废的事情发急。陈庆云一进车间就弯下身子与车间主任一起，像医生为病人诊断一样，摸摸这里看看那里，又用耳朵贴在机器上面，静听机器的转动声。听了一会，陈庆云抬起头来，对车间主任说：“这个走刀箱不能用油管，应该另打油路……”
    没等他说完，旁边就有人说：“怎么能不用油管？这是外国设计的啊！”
    陈庆云凭着他三十多年的修理经验，仍旧不慌不忙地对车间主任说：“油路就像人的脉络，脉络不通，人要生病；油路不通，机器也不能运转”。他把自己想了好久的修改油路的打算一一告诉了车间主任。车间主任连连点头。为了使陈庆云能直接参加这个工作，党决定把他调回装配车间。他为了不辜负党的支持和期望，下定决心坚决攻下这个“堡垒”。于是晚上苦思苦想，白天就和大家一起商量，反复研究。一次失败了再来一次，经过几次的试验，另打油路终于实现了。走刀箱内的齿轮均匀地转动着，车油畅通地流进了箱内。两年多的老问题解决了，搁起来的机床也一台一台地走上了生产岗位。
    帮助别人协作风格高
    厂里自从制造重型机床以后，一向用手工操作的起重运输实在太不相称了。搬动一只零件，十二、三个人，大家吃力地摇着手摇车，混身上下流着汗，从厂门口搬到车间，短短几百米的距离，用上半天、一天并不希奇。起重工也想搞技术革命，但搞了几次未成功。
    一天，陈庆云路过起重队，正在工作的起重工周洪川向他说：“帮助我们想想办法吧！”陈庆云见了这种状况，心里感到是个问题，可是要帮助改吧，目前自己任务很重，日日夜夜抽不出身来。当他想起了党经常告诉他要发扬共产主义精神，他忽然自言自语地说：“分什么你我，大家都是为了社会主义。”就这样，他很认真地把这件事记在心里。手摇要实行机械化，就得要材料，陈庆云处处留意着，甚至去饭厅吃饭的时候，路上遇到废旧料，也蹲下去琢磨个半天。有一次他在车间里的暗角处翻到了一套已经报废了的旧吊车，陈师傅当宝贝似的拣回来一看，外面虽不像样，里面却是一套完整的“华门牙齿箱”。他高兴地说：“用它来改手摇车不是正合适吗？”正好这时候外厂来了个起重队，这个起重队带来了一台电动手摇车。陈庆云知道后，连忙跑到摇车旁认真地看着、看着，突然闪过一个念头：“按照这个办法来改手摇车不是很好吗？”于是他和史连生一商量，二人着手准备起来，只要一有空就到处跑，几乎翻遍了整个车间的暗角，寻找废旧料来代用。在今年3月5日为了迎接厂里的跃进大会，与史连生苦战一个通宵，终于将一台手摇车改成了电动。现在只要一按电钮马达一转，几十吨重的物件就像被驯服了的猛虎一样，乖乖地跑了。可是陈庆云并不以此为满足，最近他又为运输工改制一台手板车，和改制一台双筒式电动摇车，这台摇车可顶上七个劳动力，又提高了工作效率。陈庆云就这样帮助了沉重劳动的起重运输工变得轻松愉快。
    那么，这些成就是怎么得来的呢？几年来，陈庆云在无数次的技术革新试验——失败——再试验，最后获得成功的过程中，得到了一个深刻的体会，就是“坚决跟着党走，听党的话，依靠组织，依靠群众，一切困难都可解决”。他说：“世界上的事情都是我们工人做出来的，工人做出的东西都能用。但是，想搞一次能成功，是不可能的。只要我们坚决依靠党，依靠群众，一次搞不成第二次再来；二次又不成再搞第三次，总有一次能成功的。有了这样的信心，天大的困难也就可以克服了”。
    陈庆云就是树立了这样的信念，促使他不断革新。
