    Classic Works Require Repeated Study
    ——Reflections on Learning
    Wang Che
    The longer I study Marxist theory, the more I feel that to truly grasp the rich content of classic works, repeated study is essential.

    Many articles and books, when read at the time, seem very enlightening and provide some insights; however, after a year or two, rereading them often feels bland. Classic works are different. The first time you read them, you may not fully understand them, feeling only a vague comprehension. But after a period of time, with more knowledge and experience accumulated, when you pick up the book again, you will find some gains. If you read it again after another period, you will gain new insights. It's like eating olives, the more you eat, the better they taste. Some classic works, especially some of Chairman Mao's articles, are written in a very accessible and easy-to-understand style, but it is by no means possible to fully understand all their content by studying them only once or reading them superficially a few times. These articles conceal extremely rich and profound content beneath their simple and approachable form. Speaking for myself, when the People's Daily republished "On Practice" in 1951, I studied it carefully and read it intensively many times. I studied it again not long after. At the time, I thought that having studied it so many times, it was probably enough. But later, when I encountered practical problems in my work and theoretical problems when writing articles, I felt the need to revisit "On Practice" and see what Chairman Mao had said. Of course, I remembered the general meaning, but that was not enough. I needed to carefully ponder the original text. In doing so, I found that although I seemed to have read it very carefully before, some sentences had slipped past me, and I hadn't grasped their meaning, or my understanding was not deep enough. This rereading allowed me to further appreciate the content of "On Practice." Thus, for the past eight or nine years, I have reread "On Practice" several times each year, and I believe I will continue to rely on it in the future.

    This is significantly different from learning certain natural sciences. For example, learning mathematics is very clear-cut; you either understand or you don't. Once you understand a theorem in mathematics, you can't understand it "more." All students who understand the theorem have a very hard time showing differences in their understanding. Philosophical principles are different. You may understand it literally, but not understand the content; even the understanding of the content can vary in depth, and the difference in depth can be very significant.

    Hegel said more than once: "The same maxim, when spoken by a young man (even if he understands it perfectly correctly), never has the meaning and breadth possessed by the wisdom of a seasoned adult, who is able to express the full force of the content contained in the maxim." In "Philosophical Notebooks," Lenin wrote next to this passage: "A very good comparison."

    Indeed, it is a very good comparison. Although maxims are brief, they often summarize many life experiences and lessons. A young person lacking life experience, although they can interpret a maxim correctly in terms of the words, can only have a limited understanding of its rich content. As for an elderly person, the maxim is no longer an abstract truth, but contains the meaning they have discerned in their own decades of life experience.

    Therefore, there are young mathematicians, but there are no young philosophers. The reason is that the understanding of philosophy must be based on a considerable amount of life experience and knowledge. In mathematics, one is one, and two is two; all concepts can be expressed by a simple, clear, and definite definition. The content of a theorem can be completely and exhaustively expressed in its statement. Therefore, reviewing a mathematics textbook is usually only to avoid forgetting, and it is difficult to talk about "reviewing the old to learn the new." In philosophical works, concepts are much more complex, and definitions are much more difficult to formulate. Sometimes, a paragraph or even a sentence, if discussed and elaborated in detail, can become an entire book. Our understanding of classic works grows with the growth of our life experience, knowledge, and comprehension abilities.

    Cows have the habit of ruminating, and I think we also need to "ruminate" when reading books. We should repeatedly chew on classic works, "ruminating" every once in a while, so that we can slowly digest and absorb their nutrients. Many of our comrades often have this feeling: they have read some classic works, but they can't remember them. Therefore, the following situation often occurs: in study discussions, everyone argues about a problem, and after arguing for a long time, they don't reach a conclusion; someone checks the book and finds that the problem has already been discussed in classic works, and it has been solved very well. But everyone has read this book, only they have forgotten it. Why do we forget? I think this is because we don't understand it deeply enough, and at the time of reading the book, the problem had not yet arisen in our minds, so we didn't pay attention to it. It can be seen that it is necessary to read it again after a period of time and repeatedly chew on it. If we now reread Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and relate it to the current mass movements, we will definitely have a deeper understanding.

    Classic works should be read carefully, word by word and sentence by sentence. Regarding the relationship between the words and spirit of classic works, we should have a comprehensive understanding. It is right that we should learn from classic works not their words but their spirit and essence. But this does not mean that we can ignore the words when studying. Generally speaking, the spirit is not outside the words, but is expressed by the words. Classic writers use words and sentences very accurately and rigorously. If we completely abandon the words of classic works, how can we learn its spirit? The problem is that we should not stay on the words of classic works, but should be able to "infer the other three corners from one," not only learn some specific knowledge, but more importantly, learn the viewpoints, positions, and methods. Individual words and sentences in classic works that express individual conclusions or individual principles may be outdated. Holding on to these words is dogmatism. But opposing dogmatism does not mean that we should be careless and superficial in our study. It is impossible to learn Marxism well without reading classic works carefully and repeatedly. Classic works are classic because they have the most correct, richest, and most profound content. Such works summarize the practice of the broad masses of the people, and the achievements of human knowledge over many generations, so they can withstand the test of time and are immortal. Let us abandon that impetuous attitude to learning and deeply and continuously draw wisdom from classic works.

    经典著作要反复学习
    ——学习杂感
    王澈
    学习马克思主义理论的时间长了，就会越来越感到：要真正掌握经典著作的丰富内容，不反复学习是不行的。
    有许多文章和书籍，当时读了，也觉得很有启发，得到了一些东西；过一两年再拿起来读，往往就觉得索然无味了。经典著作不一样。初读时也可能不大了然，似懂非懂，待到经过一段时期，多增长了一些知识，多积累了一些经验，再拿起这本书来看时，就觉得有些收获了。如果再过一段时期来读，又会得到新的教益。这就像吃橄榄一样，越吃越有味。也有的经典著作，特别像毛主席的一些文章，写得很通俗，很好懂，但也决不是学习一次，粗读几遍就能把它们的全部内容都了解得很透的。这些文章在平易浅近的形式下蕴藏着极其丰富深刻的内容。以笔者个人来说，1951年人民日报重新发表“实践论”时，我曾仔细地学习过，精读过不少遍。不久以后又重新学习过。当时也曾经想，学了这么多遍，大概也差不多了吧。可是以后做工作碰到一些实际问题了，写文章碰到一些理论问题了，又觉得需要去重翻“实践论”，看看毛主席是怎么说的。当然，大致的意思我是记得的，可是这不够，我需要就原文作仔细的琢磨。这样一来，就发现先前尽管似乎读得很仔细，但有些句子还是在我眼前滑过去了，并没有体会到其中的含义，或者虽有所体会而不深，而这一次的重读又使自己对“实践论”的内容有了进一步的体会。这样，八九年来我差不多每年都要重读几遍“实践论”，而且我相信我以后也离不开它。
    这和学某些自然科学的情况有显著的不同。比如学数学，就是层次分明的，懂就是懂，不懂就是不懂。对于数学上的某一条定理，你一旦懂了，就不能更多懂一些；所有懂得这一条定理的学生对这一条定理的理解很难说有什么深浅的差别。哲学的道理就不一样。可能从字面上说你已经了解了，但对内容并不了解；就是对内容的了解也有深有浅，而深浅的相差是可以非常之大的。
    黑格尔不止一次地说过这样的话：“同一句格言，从年轻人（即使他对这句格言理解得完全正确）的口中说出来时，总是没有那种在饱经风霜的成年人的智慧中所具有的意义和广袤性，后者能够表达出这句格言所包含的内容的全部力量。”在“哲学笔记”里，列宁在这段话旁边批着：“很好的比较”。
    的确是很好的比较，格言虽然简短，但是它里面常常概括了许多生活的经验和教训。缺少生活经验的少年，尽管可以从字面上把某一句格言解释得正确无误，但是这格言的丰富内容他却只能有很少的体会。至于对一个老年人，这个格言已经不是一个抽象的真理，而包含着他自己在几十年的生活经验中所体察到的意义了。
    所以有年幼的数学家，但不会有年幼的哲学家。原因就在对哲学的理解必须以相当多的生活经验和知识为基础。在数学中，一是一，二是二，所有的概念都可以用一个简单、清楚而确定的定义来表明。一个定理的内容，可以在它的表述形式里表达得完尽无遗。所以复习数学教科书，通常只是为了不致遗忘，而很难谈到“温故知新”。在哲学性的著作中，单是概念就复杂得多，定义也难下得多。有时，一段话甚至一句话的内容，如果加以详尽的讨论和发挥，可以变成一整本书。我们对于经典著作的理解，是随着我们的生活经验、各种知识和理解能力的增长而增长的。
    牛有反刍的习惯，我觉得我们读书也需要“反刍”。对于经典著作要反复咀嚼，隔一个时期“反刍”一回，这样总可以慢慢消化，吸收它的养料的。我们许多同志常有这样一个感觉：经典著作读是读了一些，就是记不住。所以常发生这样的情况：在学习讨论会上大家争论一个问题，争来争去得不到结果；有人查了查书，结果发现这个问题在经典著作中已经谈到了，而且解决得很好。可是这本书大家也都看过，只是忘记了。为什么会忘记呢？我想这是由于体会得不深，而且在看书的当时自己心中还没有出现这个问题，所以也没有注意。可见隔一个时期读一遍，反复咀嚼，这是必要的。假如我们现在重新读一读毛主席的“湖南农民运动考察报告”，联系到当前的群众运动，一定会有深一层的体会。
    经典著作是要逐字逐句精读的。关于经典著作的字句和精神的关系，我们应该有全面的了解，我们要从经典著作中学习的，不是它的字句而是它的精神实质，这是对的。但是不能因此就认为在学习时可以不重视字句。一般说来，精神并不在字句以外，而正是用字句来表现的。经典作家的用词造句，都是十分准确严密的，如果完全抛开经典著作的字句，又怎么能学到它的精神呢？问题只是，我们不要停留在经典著作的字句上，要能够“举一隅则以三隅反”，不只是学到一些具体的知识，更重要的是学到其中的观点、立场、方法。经典著作中的个别字句所表述的个别结论或个别原理是可能过时的，死抱住这些字句，那是教条主义。但是反对教条主义并不意味着我们学习时应该粗枝大叶，浅尝即止，不认真地、反复地阅读经典著作，是学不好马克思主义的。经典著作之所以为经典著作，就因为它有最正确最丰富最深刻的内容。这样的著作是概括了广大人民的实践，概括了人类多少世代认识的成果，所以是经得起时间考验的，是不朽的。让我们抛开那种浮躁的学习态度，深入地、反复不断地从经典著作中吸取智慧吧。
