　　Talking about Exerting Full Effort and Objective Laws
　　Xu Feiguang
　　Right-leaning opportunists, who fear mass movements as if they were fires, in order to negate the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune movement, and the mass steel production campaign, cannot help but criticize the revolutionary actions of the masses in every possible way and pour cold water on them. They smear the revolutionary drive of the masses as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," "blind actions that violate objective laws," and so on. A few people with right-leaning thoughts are also often wavering on this issue, with a lot of muddled ideas. They lack drive, are spiritually萎靡 (wěimǐ - dispirited), and believe that the lower the targets are set, the more they conform to objective laws.

　　According to the logic of these people, it seems that "exerting full effort, striving for the top" will inevitably lead to "rash advances" and inevitably violate objective laws. If we want to prevent deviations from occurring in mass movements, we should abolish the slogan of "exerting full effort, striving for the top." However, we know that without "exerting full effort, striving for the top," there would be no mass movements. In this way, the General Line would become empty words, and the Great Leap Forward would not have occurred at all.

　　Does "exerting full effort, striving for the top" really have an irresolvable contradiction with objective laws? The fact is not so. As Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report at the Fifth Session of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress, the General Line not only does not conflict with objective laws, but "itself requires us to maximize subjective initiative based on objective conditions, follow objective economic laws, and pay attention to various proportional relationships." "Exerting full effort, striving for the top" is an important component of the General Line, and this slogan itself correctly embodies the dialectical relationship between objective laws and subjective initiative.

　　What is drive? The revolutionary drive we are talking about refers to the masses' "revolutionary perseverance, revolutionary creativity, and revolutionary pioneering spirit," which refers to their "actions of actively creating world history regardless of personal safety" (Lenin). Exerting full effort means maximizing the subjective initiative of the broad masses. What is "the top"? This refers to the best possibility that objectively exists. There is a distinction between the top, the middle, and the bottom in everything, which means there are all kinds of possibilities. And striving for the top means that, in practical activities, we should use our greatest efforts to strive to achieve the best possibility allowed by objective conditions.

　　Materialists admit that human actions cannot go beyond the scope allowed by objective laws. But at the same time, we believe that within the scope allowed by objective laws, different subjective initiatives of people can produce completely different results. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The stage for the activities of military strategists is built on top of objective material conditions, but with this stage, military strategists can direct many vivid, magnificent, and heroic plays." A ship cannot sail in the water against the laws of water, otherwise, it will sink. But there can be two different attitudes towards observing this law. One person thinks that since the law cannot be violated, it is better to put the ship in the water and let it drift. Another person creates oars, builds sails, and organizes all the manpower on the ship to work together to quickly reach the destination. Right-leaning opportunism belongs to the former, and they will never reach the other side of the ocean. The broad masses of working people belong to the latter. In their view, as long as they act according to the laws, the laws will not become ropes that restrict people's subjective initiative. On the contrary, it provides a broad space for people's subjective initiative to play its role. And the meaning of the slogan "exerting full effort, striving for the top" itself is to maximize the subjective initiative of the revolutionary masses on the basis of understanding objective laws, to strive to realize the best possibility that objectively exists.

　　Is it that the greater the drive, the more likely it is to violate objective laws, and the smaller the drive, the lower the targets are set, the less likely it is to violate objective laws? The fact is not so. Whether objective laws are violated does not depend on the size of the drive, but on whether people estimate objective laws in their actions and strictly abide by objective laws. Of course, if you act against objective laws, the greater the drive, the more severely you will be bumped into in the face of objective laws. Wasn't Hitler's counter-revolutionary drive very great throughout his life? But because his drive was a drive that violated the laws of historical development, he could not but enter the tomb with failure. But we must never conclude from this that a smaller drive, setting the targets as low as possible, will not violate the law. A person who is not water-savvy and cannot swim, no matter how low he sets the swimming speed target, he will inevitably suffer the disaster of being submerged. If you don't act according to the laws, you will inevitably run into obstacles, regardless of the size of the drive. But if people can strictly act according to objective laws, then the greater the drive, the greater the results may be obtained. The more and deeper people understand objective laws, the more they can make their subjective initiative play a greater role. The so-called "there is no end to the top, and there is no limit to the drive" is what it means.

　　Right-leaning opportunists will come out again and say after hearing what we have said, since this is the case, then you should first understand objective laws, and then鼓干劲 (gǔ gànjìng - encourage effort). Don't some people complain that our Great Leap Forward has not passed the test? These people have forgotten: the understanding of objective laws must be gradually clarified and gradually deepened in the process of practice. The length of this process also depends to a certain extent on the size of people's drive. For example, swimming, we must never fully grasp the laws of swimming on land before we go into the water, but we must gradually master the technique of swimming in the process of actual swimming. Everything passes through experimentation. This does not mean that the stage of experimentation and the stage of practice should be absolutely separated, but a process of constant experimentation and constant promotion interwoven with each other. Through this process, people can grasp more objective laws.

　　For the broad masses of revolutionary people, understanding objective laws, the more they understand these objective laws, the clearer they will be about their direction of progress, the more confident and courageous they can be about their actions, and therefore they can be more motivated. But right-leaning opportunists are terrified and helpless in the face of objective laws. For us, understanding objective laws is to use them to serve us, but right-leaning opportunists, after understanding the laws, turn them into ropes that restrict people's progress. In fact, they completely use a fatalistic view to treat objective laws, thinking that people are helpless and pitiful bugs in the face of objective laws. They seem to respect objective laws very much, but in fact, they have completely fallen into the quagmire of idealism.

　　Why do they fall into this quagmire of idealism? Their pitiful thing is that they can't see the masses, they can't see the endless creative power contained in the broad masses of working people, this power, once it erupts, can "turn the world upside down." They see things but not people, and they don't believe in the truth that the working masses create the world. Therefore, they cannot but lose confidence and be pessimistic and disappointed in the face of objective laws. Comrade Mao Zedong often told us to trust the masses and rely on the masses. He fully believed that the working people, with their full efforts, can not only overthrow the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, but also use their own strength to quickly change the poor and blank situation left over from old China. But in the minds of right-leaning opportunists, the 600 million working people of China are still a pitiful slave appearance, so they cannot but have a pessimistic view of China's rapid construction into a great socialist power. This view of the working masses is actually a bourgeois master attitude. Therefore, it is not surprising that they stand by, gesticulate, pick faults, and don't look at the achievements in the great mass movement. But 600 million people will never abandon the great revolutionary heroism of "exerting full effort, striving for the top" because of this. They will continue to carry forward the revolutionary drive and implement the general line of socialism to the end. But all right-leaning opportunists cannot but face a historical choice, either to wake up in the vigorous revolutionary mass movement, abandon the bourgeois point of view, re-estimate the power of the broad masses of working people, and stand among the masses and advance side by side with them, or be submerged by this surging mass movement and become a pitiful bug crying in the corner. They must choose an attitude. This is a question that cannot be avoided.

　　谈鼓足干劲和客观规律
　　徐非光
    害怕群众运动好像害怕火灾一样的右倾机会主义分子，为了否定大跃进、人民公社运动和大办钢铁运动的伟大成绩，就不能不对群众的革命行动多方责难，向他们大泼冷水。把群众的革命干劲污蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热”，“违反客观规律的盲目行动”等等。少数有右倾思想的人，在这个问题上也往往是摇摇摆摆，存在着一大堆糊涂观点。他们干劲不足，精神萎靡，认为指标订得愈低，就愈符合客观规律。
    根据这些人的逻辑，似乎“鼓足干劲、力争上游”就必然会发生“冒进”，必然会触犯客观规律性。要想防止群众运动发生偏差，就应当取消“鼓足干劲、力争上游”这个口号。然而我们知道，没有了“鼓足干劲、力争上游”，也就不会出现什么群众运动。这样一来，总路线就变成了空文，大跃进也根本不会产生。
    难道“鼓足干劲、力争上游”真的与客观规律存在着不可解决的矛盾吗？事实并不如此。正如周恩来同志在第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第五次会议上的报告中指出的，总路线不仅不与客观规律相抵触，他“本身就要求我们根据客观的条件，最大限度地发挥主观能动性，遵从客观经济规律，注意各种比例关系”。“鼓足干劲、力争上游”是总路线的重要构成部分，这个口号本身就正确体现了客观规律性和主观能动性的辩证关系。
    什么是干劲？我们所说的革命干劲就是指的群众的那种“革命毅力、革命创造力、革命首创精神”，就是指的他们那种“奋不顾身积极创造世界历史的行动”（列宁）。鼓足干劲，就是要最大限度地发挥广大群众的这种主观能动作用。什么是“上游”？这是指的客观存在的最好的可能性。干什么事情都存在着上游、中游、下游之分，就是说有各种各样的可能性。而力争上游，也就是说，要在实践活动中用最大的努力争取实现客观条件所允许的最好的可能性。
    唯物主义者承认人的行动不可以超越客观规律所允许的范围。但是我们同时却认为在客观规律所允许的范围内，人的不同主观能动作用可以产生完全不同的结果。毛泽东同志说过：“军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来”。船不能违背水的规律在水里行走，否则他要沉没。可是对于遵守这条规律，却可以有两种不同态度，一种人认为既然不能违反规律，那就把船放在水里任其漂泊好了。另一种人创造了桨，造了帆，把全船人力组织起来同心协力，使船迅速达到目的地。右倾机会主义就属于前者，他们永远无法达到大海的对岸。而广大劳动人民则属于后者，在他们看来，只要按照规律去办事，规律就不会成为限制人的主观能动性的绳索。恰恰相反，它给人的主观能动性提供了发挥作用的广阔场所。而“鼓足干劲、力争上游”这个口号本身的含义，就是要在认识客观规律的基础上，最大限度地发挥革命群众的主观能动作用，来争取实现客观存在着的最好的可能性。
    是不是干劲大了就会触犯客观规律，干劲小一些、提出的指标低一些，就可以不触犯客观规律呢？事实并不如此。是否触犯客观规律，并不决定于干劲大或干劲小，而决定于人们是否在其行动中估计到客观规律，并严格地遵照客观规律办事。当然，违反了客观规律去行动，干劲愈大，便会在客观规律面前碰得越厉害。希特勒的一生中，反革命的干劲不是很大吗？但是由于他的干劲是违背历史发展规律的干劲，所以他不能不带着失败走进坟墓。可是绝不能因此得出结论说，干劲小一些，指标订得尽量低一些，就不会触犯规律了。一个不识水性，不会游泳的人，把游泳速度的指标订得再低，他还是免不了遭到没顶之灾。不按照规律办事，不管是干劲大小，都免不了要碰壁的。但是如果人们能严格按照客观规律去行动，那么干劲愈大，就可能得到愈大的成果。人对客观规律认识得愈多、愈深刻，就可能使人的主观能动作用发挥更大的作用，所谓“上游无止境，干劲没有顶”，就是这个意思。
    右倾机会主义者听了我们的话又会出来说，既然如此，那么你们就先去认识客观规律，然后再来鼓干劲吧。不见有些人埋怨我们的大跃进没有通过试验吗？这些人忘掉了：对客观规律的认识是要在实践过程中逐步明确、逐步深刻的。这个过程的长短在一定的意义上也决定于人的干劲大小。譬如游泳，我们决不能在陆地上把游泳的规律完全掌握了以后才下水，而是要在实际游泳的过程中逐步掌握游泳的技术。一切通过试验，这绝不是说要把试验的阶段和实践的阶段绝然分离开来，而是不断试验，不断推广的互相交错的过程。通过这个过程，人们才能更多的掌握客观规律性。
    对于广大的革命群众来说，认识客观规律，对这种客观规律认识得愈多，他们对自己的前进方向就会愈明确，他们对自己的行动就可以更有信心和勇气，因此就可能把干劲鼓得更足。但是右倾机会主义者却在客观规律面前胆战心惊，束手无策。对于我们来说，认识了客观规律是为了利用它为我们服务，但右倾机会主义者认识了规律，却使它变成限制人们前进的绳索。实际上他们完全是用宿命论的观点来看待客观规律，以为人在客观规律面前是无能为力的可怜虫。他们看来好像非常尊重客观规律，实际上却完全堕入了唯心论的泥坑。
    为什么他们会堕入这种唯心论的泥坑呢？他们的可悲之处，就在于看不见群众，看不见广大劳动群众中蕴藏的无穷无尽的创造力量，这种力量一旦爆发出来，就可以“把世界翻过来”。他们见物不见人，根本不相信劳动群众创造世界的真理。因之他们就不能不在客观规律面前丧失信心，悲观失望。毛泽东同志经常告诉我们要相信群众，依靠群众，他完全相信，劳动人民鼓足了干劲，不仅能够推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，而且能够用自己的力量，迅速改变旧中国所遗留下来的一穷二白的状况。但是在右倾机会主义者的心目中，中国的六亿劳动人民却仍然还是一副可怜的奴隶相，这样，他们就不能不对中国迅速建成一个伟大的社会主义强国抱悲观主义的看法。这种对待劳动群众的看法，实际上是一种资产阶级的老爷式态度。因此，他们在伟大的群众运动中，站在旁边，指手划脚，专挑毛病，不看成绩，就完全不是什么奇怪的事情了。但是六亿人民决不会因此就抛掉“鼓足干劲、力争上游”的伟大革命英雄主义气概。他们将继续发扬革命的干劲，把社会主义的总路线贯彻到底。但是一切右倾机会主义者却不能不面临一次历史的抉择，或者是在轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动中惊醒过来，抛掉资产阶级的观点，重新估计广大劳动人民的力量，并站在群众之中与他们并肩前进，或者是被这种汹涌澎湃的群众运动所淹没，去做向隅而泣的可怜虫，他们必须选择一种态度，这是不能回避的问题。
