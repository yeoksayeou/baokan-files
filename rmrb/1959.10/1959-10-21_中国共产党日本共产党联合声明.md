Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: The delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party signed the Joint Statement of the Communist Party of China and the Japanese Communist Party in Beijing this afternoon. The joint statement was signed by Liu Shaoqi, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of China, and Sanzo Nosaka, head of the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party, on behalf of their respective parties.

The following comrades were present from the CPC side at the signing of the joint statement: Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Peng Zhen, Wang Jiaxiang, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, and Wu Xiuquan.

The following comrades were present from the JCP side: Ritsumi Hakamada, Koreto Kurahara, Ichizo Sunama, Masao Iwama, and staff member of the delegation, Tsutomu Hoshino.

The delegation of the Japanese Communist Party, headed by Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, came to China on September 26, 1959, at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also made visits to various parts of China.

Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party and held warm and cordial talks.

The delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party held talks in Beijing.

The following participated in the talks from the Chinese Communist Party side: Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, Wang Jiaxiang, and Liao Chengzhi.

The following participated in the talks from the Japanese Communist Party side: Sanzo Nosaka, Ritsumi Hakamada, Koreto Kurahara, Ichizo Sunama, and Masao Iwama.

The talks were conducted in a fraternal and extremely friendly atmosphere. The two sides reviewed the development of the international situation since the joint statement issued by the Communist Parties of China and Japan in March this year, conducted further exchanges on issues concerning the relations between China and Japan and between the two parties, and reached completely unanimous agreement.

The delegations of the two parties unanimously believe that the development of the international situation in the past six months has confirmed the assessment made in the joint statement of the Communist Parties of China and Japan, that is, the forces of socialism, national independence, peace, and democracy are increasingly overwhelming the forces of imperialism. At present, the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are accelerating the construction of their economies and cultures, the movements for national independence, democratic freedom in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are continuing to move forward, and the struggles of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace and democracy have also made great progress. It is precisely under such a situation that the peace policy of the socialist camp is increasingly receiving the warm support of the people of the world, while the policy of strength of the imperialist camp headed by U.S. imperialism has suffered a shameful bankruptcy. The socialist camp is a powerful peace bastion that cannot be destroyed by any imperialist united forces, and the peace policy of this camp will continue to defeat the aggressive activities and cold war policies of the imperialist camp.

Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States gave a heavy blow to the cold war forces in the United States, and it was a great contribution to easing international tensions and the cause of world peace. It will have a positive and far-reaching impact on the development of the international situation in the future. The two parties unanimously support the Soviet Union's initiatives to ease international tensions, end the Cold War, implement peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and the recent proposal for complete disarmament.

The delegations of the two parties continue to emphasize that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of China and Japan. Under the current favorable situation, continuing to oppose the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism and safeguard world peace, especially peace in the Far East, remains one of the fundamental tasks of the peoples and the Communist Parties of China and Japan. It must be seen that the U.S. warmongering clique is unwilling to face the general trend of the world, unwilling to abandon the Cold War, and on the contrary, is now strengthening its military bases and various military treaty organizations abroad, continuing to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and carrying out provocations to intensify international tensions. In the Far East, U.S. imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces, are still stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, attempting to strengthen their rule and plunder of the Japanese people by revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and to strengthen the open military alliance hostile to China and the Soviet Union. This is a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world.

The delegation of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that today, in Japan, the Nobusuke Kishi government, as an agent of monopoly capital, disregards the strong opposition of the Japanese people, violates the interests of the Japanese nation, and willingly acts as a tool of U.S. imperialism. Recently, it has intensified its efforts to quickly revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, further making Japan a militarist and imperialist country again, expanding into Southeast Asian countries, and threatening the security of China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. In order to implement this traitorous policy, the Nobusuke Kishi government is constantly depriving the Japanese people of their democratic rights. The Japanese Communist Party soberly estimates that if this policy succeeds, the Japanese people will be in danger of once again serving as cannon fodder in aggressive wars, which will bring unprecedented and profound disasters to the Japanese nation. The Japanese Communist Party has always believed that the path the Japanese people should take is the path of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality. This means achieving complete independence for the Japanese nation externally, abolishing military alliances concluded with foreign countries, withdrawing foreign troops and their military bases from Japan, not participating in any military blocs, and establishing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries; internally, it means guaranteeing the people's democratic rights and the people's livelihood. The current urgent task of struggle for the Japanese people is to stop U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government from revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and to further abolish this treaty. In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese Communist Party has always been full of confidence, fighting unremittingly with the broad masses of the people, and doing its utmost to unite all patriotic and democratic forces led by the working class to establish a united front including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

The Communist Party of China expresses its complete support for the just propositions of the Japanese Communist Party and expresses its boundless respect for the heroic struggle waged by the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. The struggle of the Japanese Communist Party to get rid of U.S. imperialism's rule and establish an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral Japan proves that it is the staunch defender of the interests of the Japanese nation and people. The delegations of the two Communist Parties discussed the current Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides unanimously believe that all abnormal phenomena in the current relations between the two countries should be entirely blamed on U.S. imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces. The delegation of the Communist Party of China pointed out that China has suffered decades of aggression from Japanese imperialism, and the Chinese people have suffered incalculable damage due to this foreign aggression. However, since its founding, the People's Republic of China has consistently adopted a policy of friendship and amity towards the Japanese people. The basic principle of China's foreign policy is to unswervingly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China opposes any foreign aggression and will never invade others. Communism is absolutely incompatible with aggression. The Chinese people hope that the Japanese people can get rid of their subordinate status to the United States as soon as possible and achieve full independence. The Chinese People also hope that the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Japan can break through all artificial obstacles and develop. The delegations of the two parties expressed unanimous condemnation of the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China. As long as the Japanese government abandons and changes this reactionary policy, does not participate in the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and does not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, then normal trade relations and cultural exchanges between the two countries will definitely develop smoothly. The conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries, resulting from the restoration and development of such normal relations, is precisely the common desire of the people of both countries.

The delegation of the Japanese Communist Party stated that the Japanese people fully support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan. The delegation of the Communist Party of China also stated that the Chinese people fully support the Japanese people's struggle to demand the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

During its visit to China, the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party saw with its own eyes that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and developed Marxism-Leninism. After leading the Chinese people to realize the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts in a very short period of time, the Communist Party of China put forward the general line of building socialism, relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people to build socialism, opened up a situation of great leap forward in the national economy, and realized the people's communeization of the Chinese countryside, thereby achieving great achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The delegation of the Japanese Communist Party expresses its admiration for all the achievements made by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people.

The delegations of the two parties believe that safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the unity of the communist ranks is the sacred duty of all communists. In order to undermine the unity of the communist ranks, imperialists not only use various means of instigation, but also use modern revisionists and Trotskyites to intensify their ideological attacks on Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, in order to defend Marxism-Leninism and to defend the unity of the proletarian ranks, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle against modern revisionists and Trotskyites.

The delegations of the two parties are convinced that the visit of the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party to China and the talks between the two parties of China and Japan will help to enhance the friendship between the two parties and will also be conducive to the development of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. The peoples and the Communist Parties of China and Japan will certainly work together with the people of all countries in the world to make greater contributions to defending peace in the Far East and the world, safeguarding the national independence of all countries, and promoting the cause of democracy and social progress.

    新华社20日讯　中国共产党代表团和日本共产党代表团今天下午在北京签署了中国共产党、日本共产党联合声明。联合声明是由中国共产党代表团团长刘少奇、日本共产党代表团团长野坂参三分别代表两党签署的。
    签署两党联合声明时，中共方面在场的有：周恩来、朱德、彭真、王稼祥、廖承志、刘宁一和伍修权同志。
    日共方面在场的有：袴田里见、藏原惟人、砂间一良、岩间正男同志和代表团随员星野力同志。
    以日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三同志为首的日本共产党代表团，应中国共产党中央委员会的邀请，于1959年9月26日前来中国，参加了中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆祝典礼，并且在中国各地进行了参观访问。
    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，会见了日本共产党代表团，进行了热烈的、亲切的谈话。
    中国共产党代表团和日本共产党代表团，在北京举行了会谈。
    中国共产党方面参加会谈的有：刘少奇、周恩来、彭真、王稼祥、廖承志。
    日本共产党方面参加会谈的有：野坂参三、袴田里见、藏原惟人、砂间一良、岩间正男。
    会谈是在兄弟般的极其友好的气氛中进行的。双方回顾了今年3月中日两国共产党发表联合声明以来国际形势的发展，就中日两国和两党的关系问题进行了进一步的交谈，并且取得了完全一致的意见。
    两党代表团一致认为，半年来国际形势的发展，证实了中日两国共产党联合声明所作的估计，这就是社会主义的力量、民族独立的、和平的、民主的力量愈来愈压倒了帝国主义的力量。现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国正在加速地发展着经济文化的建设，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立、民主自由的运动正在继续向前发展，世界各国人民保卫和平民主的斗争也取得巨大的进展。正是在这样的形势下，社会主义阵营的和平政策愈来愈得到世界人民的热烈拥护，而以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的实力政策遭到可耻的破产。社会主义阵营是任何帝国主义联合力量所不可摧毁的强大的和平堡垒，这个阵营的和平政策必将继续使帝国主义阵营的侵略活动和冷战政策归于失败。
    不久以前，赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，又给了美国冷战势力以沉重的打击，对于缓和国际紧张局势和世界和平事业，是一个巨大的贡献，它将对今后国际局势的发展产生积极的深远的影响。两党一致支持苏联缓和国际紧张局势、结束冷战、实行不同社会制度国家的和平共处以及最近提出的全面废除军备的创议。
    两党代表团继续强调，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。在当前的良好形势下，继续反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，保卫世界和平、特别是远东和平，仍然是中日两国人民和中日两国共产党的基本任务之一。必须看到，美国好战集团不愿正视世界的大势所趋，不愿放弃冷战，相反地，最近又正在加强在外国的军事基地和各种军事条约组织，继续干涉别国内政，实行挑衅来加剧国际紧张局势。而在远东方面，美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力仍在加紧复活日本军国主义，企图通过修改日美安全保障条约，加强对日本人民的统治和掠夺，增强以中国、苏联为敌的公开的军事同盟。这是对于远东和世界的和平的严重威胁。
    日本共产党代表团指出，今天，在日本，作为垄断资本代理人的岸信介政府，不顾日本人民的强烈反对，违背日本民族的利益，甘为美帝国主义的工具；最近更变本加厉，企图迅速修改日美安全保障条约，进一步使日本再次成为军国主义的帝国主义国家，向东南亚各国进行扩张，威胁中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家的安全。岸信介政府为着实行这种卖国政策，正在不断地剥夺日本人民的民主权利。日本共产党清醒地估计到，如果这种政策得逞，那么，日本人民就有再一次充当侵略战争的炮灰的危险，这将给日本民族带来空前深重的灾难。日本共产党一贯认为，日本人民应该走的道路，是和平、独立、民主、中立的道路。这就是对外取得日本民族的完全独立，废除同外国缔结的军事同盟，撤除在日本的外国军队及其军事基地，不参加任何军事集团，同一切国家建立和平友好关系；对内则是保障人民的民主权利和人民的生活权益。日本人民当前迫切的斗争任务，是制止美帝国主义和岸信介政府修改日美安全保障条约，并进一步来废除这个条约。日本共产党为了实现这个目的，始终满怀信心，同广大人民在一起，进行坚持不懈的斗争，并且竭尽全力为团结以工人阶级为首的一切爱国民主力量，建立包括共产党和社会党在内的统一战线进行着斗争。
    中国共产党对于日本共产党的正义主张表示完全支持，对于日本共产党和日本人民所进行的英勇斗争表示无限的敬意。日本共产党为摆脱美帝国主义的统治，建立一个独立、和平、民主、中立的日本而进行的斗争，证明它是日本民族和人民的利益的坚决保卫者。两国共产党代表团讨论了当前的中日关系问题。双方一致认为，目前两国关系中的一切不正常现象，应该完全由美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力负责。中国共产党代表团指出，中国曾经遭受日本帝国主义几十年的侵略，中国人民由于这种外来的侵略而受到了难以估计的损害。但是，中华人民共和国自从建国以来，对日本人民一贯采取了友好亲善的政策。中国对外政策的基本方针，是始终不渝地信守和平共处五项原则。中国反对任何外来的侵略，也决不侵略别人。共产主义同侵略是绝不相容的。中国人民祝望日本人民能够早日摆脱从属美国的状态，取得完全的独立。中国人民也希望中日两国人民之间具有历史传统的友谊，能够冲破一切人为的障碍而得到发展。对于岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，两党代表团表示了一致的谴责。只要日本政府放弃和改变这种反动政策，不参加美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，那么，两国的正常贸易关系和文化来往一定能够得到顺利的发展。随着这种正常关系的恢复和发展而导致两国之间互不侵犯条约的缔结，正是两国人民的共同愿望。
    日本共产党代表团表示，日本人民充分支持中国人民为解放自己领土台湾而进行的斗争。中国共产党代表团也表示，中国人民充分支持日本人民要求收回冲绳和小笠原群岛的斗争。
    日本共产党代表团在中国访问期间亲眼看到，中国共产党在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下，创造性地把马克思列宁主义应用于中国革命和建设的实际，并且发展了马克思列宁主义。中国共产党在很短时间内，领导中国人民实现了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命以后，提出了建设社会主义总路线，依靠广大人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，开创了国民经济大跃进的局面，实现了中国农村的人民公社化，从而取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。日本共产党代表团对于中国共产党和中国人民所取得的一切成就，表示钦佩。
    两党代表团认为，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁和共产主义队伍的团结，是一切共产党人的神圣职责。帝国主义者为了破坏共产主义队伍的团结，不仅使用各种挑拨离间的手段，并且利用现代修正主义者和托洛茨基分子，从思想意识方面加紧向马克思列宁主义进攻。因此，为了保卫马克思列宁主义，为了捍卫无产阶级队伍的团结，就必须加强同现代修正主义者和托洛茨基分子作斗争。
    两党代表团确信，日本共产党代表团的访问中国，中日两党之间的会谈，将有助于增强中日两党的友谊，也有利于发展中日两国人民的友好关系。中日两国人民和两国共产党，一定将同世界各国人民一道，为保卫远东和世界和平、维护各国的民族独立、推进民主和社会进步事业，作出更大的贡献。中国共产党代表团团长
