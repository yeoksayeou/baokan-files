Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th. Jiangxi has unveiled the prelude to winter water conservancy construction, with 300,000 laborers投入 into the winter construction movement, striving to complete the winter and spring water conservancy construction tasks ahead of schedule, and preparing early for the great leap forward in agricultural production next year.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated the province's winter and spring water conservancy construction plan as early as early August this year, deciding to build 41,000 new water conservancy projects of various types (including 357 large-scale projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu). After these projects are completed, the irrigated area will be expanded and improved by 10 million mu. At present, more than 100 large-scale projects irrigating more than 10,000 mu have been fully started, and more than 140 medium-sized projects and thousands of small-sized projects have been started at the same time. The winter construction movement in various counties of Shangrao, Ji'an, and Yichun prefectures has been fully launched. In Shangrao Prefecture, Yushan and Boyang counties alone have 60,000 laborers engaged in water conservancy construction. In Ji'an Prefecture, Jishui, Taihe, and Yongxin counties have arranged for more than 40,000 laborers to participate in winter construction. In Yichun Prefecture, Qingjiang, Fengcheng, Pingxiang, Yichun and other twelve counties have started 200 water conservancy projects, with 70,000 laborers fighting on the construction sites. The 15 large-scale projects planned to be completed this winter and next spring in the Gannan Administrative Region have been surveyed and designed, and are about to be fully started.

With the development of the winter construction movement, Party committees at all levels have promptly strengthened their leadership, mobilizing the people to launch a vigorous red flag competition and technological innovation upsurge. The Yichun Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred more than 100 cadres to lead technical personnel to guide the winter construction work at various construction sites. The first secretaries of the county Party committees in Ji'an Prefecture personally took command and dispatched county Party committee members to be stationed at the construction sites to lead the winter construction. On the more than 200 water conservancy construction sites in Shangrao Prefecture, a "double comparison" red flag competition upsurge has emerged, comparing speed and quality, and the average work efficiency has increased from 0.8 cubic meters to 2.8 cubic meters.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient equipment, various water conservancy construction sites have tried every means to set up thousands of small-scale factories for cement, explosives, and tool repair, using local materials to produce various equipment needed for water conservancy construction in large quantities. The more than 100 cement plants and explosive factories set up by the water conservancy construction sites in Jiujiang Prefecture have produced 100 tons of cement and 10,000 jin of explosives. The tool repair factories set up by the water conservancy construction sites in Fuzhou Prefecture have the production capacity to fully bear the task of repairing and producing medium and small-sized tools for various construction sites.

After the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee determined the plan, the prefectures, counties, and communes in Jiangxi Province held water conservancy work conferences at all levels, analyzed the favorable situation for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, and unanimously agreed that: the superior organization of the people's communes, the rapid development of commune-run industries, and the rich experience in water conservancy construction over the past ten years are very favorable conditions for completing the water conservancy construction tasks this winter and next spring. The conferences at all levels determined the tasks of water conservancy construction in their respective regions and formulated specific measures. The main measures taken in various places are: 1. Continue to implement the principle of "water storage as the main focus, small-scale as the main focus, and commune-run as the main focus," and give full play to the role of the commune's manpower, materials, and financial resources. 2. Rationally arrange labor. This winter and next spring, various places plan to arrange 30% of the total labor force to repair water conservancy; unify the organization of various professional teams, and implement large-scale corps operations. At the same time, widely carry out cooperation based on the principle of equivalent exchange, and mutually adjust labor and equipment. 3. Carry out technological innovation movement. On the one hand, vigorously engage in tool reform, mobilize the masses to create new tools, improve work efficiency, and strive for an average work efficiency of 3 cubic meters; on the other hand, build a large number of small factories on the construction site, using local materials and local production, basically solving the needs of equipment by themselves. 4. Strengthen leadership. Party committee secretaries at all levels personally took command, full-time cadres were specially responsible, and cadres went to the construction site to eat, live, and work with the laborers, and directed operations on the spot.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. The prelude to large-scale water conservancy construction in Gansu Province this winter and next spring has been unveiled.

All parts of the province are preparing tools, forage, wood, stone, lime, cement, and gunpowder and other materials for water conservancy construction; most of the prepared materials have been transported to the construction site. A large number of survey, design, and planning teams composed of cadres, peasants, and technicians in various places completed the survey, design, and planning of the main water conservancy projects to be built this winter and next spring in mid-September, and have submitted planning design drawings and construction data. Now, peasants in Pingliang, Tianshui, Zhangye, Dingxi four prefectures and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture and other places have entered the water conservancy construction site by the thousands. In Shandan County, which started the earliest, the leadership personally went to the front line, went deep into the construction site, and mobilized the masses to carry out appraisal and competition, and the work efficiency per person per day increased by nearly one and a half times compared with the initial start of construction, and in the first five days, 23 water canals were repaired. Tianshui City mobilizes more than 40,000 people every day, and has newly built more than 17,600 mu of irrigated land.

Gansu Province plans to build and renovate 8 million to 10 million mu of irrigated land in the 1960 water conservancy year, of which more than 75% will be completed by the people's communes. It is planned to mobilize 40% to 60% of the province's labor force, work hard for 100 days, and strive to complete about 80% of the tasks this winter and next spring. After the completion of this plan, the province will have an average of more than three mu of irrigated land per person.

    英雄儿女揭开冬修水利序幕
    江西各级干部领导三十万民工大闹竞赛
    甘肃赶调大量人力和物力投入水利前线
    据新华社南昌9日电　江西揭开水利冬修序幕，三十万民工投入冬修运动，力争提前完成今冬明春水利兴修任务，为明年农业生产大跃进早日做好准备。
    中共江西省委早在今年8月上旬就制定了今冬明春的全省水利兴修计划，决定新建各种水利工程四万一千座（其中灌溉万亩以上的大型工程三百五十七座）。这些工程完工后，将扩大与改善灌溉面积一千万亩。目前，全省已经有一百多座灌溉万亩以上的大型工程全面开工，一百四十多座中型工程和数千座小型工程同时开工。上饶、吉安、宜春等专区各县冬修运动已经全面展开。上饶专区仅玉山、波阳两县就有六万民工在兴修水利。吉安专区吉水、泰和、永新县已安排了四万多民工参加冬修。宜春专区清江、丰城、萍乡、宜春等十二个县开工的水利工程达二百座，战斗在工地上的民工达七万人。赣南行政区计划今冬明春建成的十五座大型工程，已经勘探、设计就绪，即将全面开工。
    随着冬修运动的开展，各级党委对运动及时加强了领导，发动民工掀起了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛和技术革新热潮。中共宜春地委抽调了一百多名干部带领技术人员分别到各工地巡回指导冬修工作。吉安专区各县县委第一书记亲自挂帅上阵指挥作战，并派出县委委员常驻工地领导冬修。在上饶专区的二百多个水利工地上，已出现比速度、赛质量的“双比”红旗竞赛热潮，平均工效由零点八立方米提高到了二点八立方米。
    为了解决器材不足的困难，各个水利工地千方百计地办起了成千上万座水泥、炸药、工具修造等小型工厂，就地取材，大量生产水利建设需要的各种器材。九江专区各水利工地兴办的一百多个水泥厂、炸药厂，已生产了一百吨水泥和一万斤炸药。抚州专区各水利工地兴办的工具修造厂，生产能力可以完全负担各工地修配和生产中、小型工具的任务。
    江西省各专区、县、公社在省委确定计划之后，层层召开了水利工作会议，分析了今冬明春兴修水利的有利形势，一致认为：人民公社的优越组织，社办工业的飞速发展，十年来兴修水利的丰富经验，是完成今冬明春水利兴修任务的十分有利的条件。各级会议确定了本地区兴修水利的任务，并且制订了具体措施。各地的主要措施是：一、继续贯彻“蓄水为主、小型为主、社办为主”的方针，充分发挥公社人力、物力、财力的作用。二、合理安排劳力。今冬明春各地计划安排占总数30％的劳力修水利；统一组织各种专业队，实行大兵团作战。同时，根据等价交换的原则广泛开展协作，互相调剂劳力、器材。三、开展技术革新运动。一面大闹工具改革，发动群众创制新的工具，提高工效，争取平均工效达到三立方米；一面大量兴建工地小型工厂，就地取材，就地生产，基本上自己解决器材的需要。四、加强领导。各级党委书记亲自挂帅，专职干部专门负责，干部上工地与民工同吃同住同劳动，现场指挥作战。
    新华社兰州8日电　甘肃省今冬明春大修水利的序幕已经揭开。
    全省各地正在为兴修水利准备好工具、草料、木材、石料、石灰、水泥和火药等物资；大部分准备好的物资已经运到施工现场。各地由干部、农民、技术员组成的大批勘查设计规划队，在9月中旬就把今冬明春要兴修的主要水利工程勘查、设计、规划完毕，已交出规划设计图和施工资料。现在，平凉、天水、张掖、定西四个专区和临夏回族自治州等地农民，已成千上万地进入水利建设工地。动手最早的山丹县，由于领导亲上火线，深入施工现场，发动群众开展评比竞赛，每人每天工效比初开工时提高近一倍半，在最初五天内修水渠二十三条。天水市每天出动四万多人，已新修水地一万七千六百多亩。
    甘肃省规划在1960年水利年度兴修和整修水地八百万到一千万亩，其中75％以上将由人民公社完成。计划动员全省40％至60％的劳动力，大干一百天，力争在今冬明春完成任务80％左右。完成这一计划以后，全省平均每人便有水地三亩多。
