    Let Mountain Products and Crops Both Have a Bumper Harvest
    Autumn, a colorful season, a season of harvest. In the fields, the rice is golden, the cotton is white as snow, and the millet, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and sesame emit a sweet fragrance; on the hillsides, purple grapes hang precariously, yellow pears, red apples, and haws bend the branches with their heavy weight... Crops and fruits are ripe, calling people to harvest them.
    Harvest, everything that is ripe must be harvested. Rice, cotton, corn, peanuts, sesame... are the material strength of national construction and the necessities of people's lives. We must strive for high yields and bumper harvests, and collect everything without losing a single bit. Wild mountain products such as wild grapes, mountain pears, haws, walnuts, etc., are also indispensable to people's lives and should also be collected completely. Collecting these mountain products can not only increase industrial raw materials and non-staple food for the country, enrich people's lives, but also increase income for the commune and individual members.
    In the busy season of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, how can we ensure that all crops and mountain products are harvested? The key issue is still the rational arrangement and use of labor. When arranging and using labor, we must take into account two situations: one is that after mountain products are ripe, they must be picked immediately, otherwise the fruits will rot and fall; the other is that the "three autumns" work is very heavy and urgent, requiring a large amount of labor to complete the task. According to this situation, the best way to achieve both goals is to "seize every opportunity," that is, after a certain task of the "three autumns" comes to an end, seize the time, and immediately organize labor to go to the mountains to pick ripe mountain products in a concentrated effort. At the same time, we can also adopt a combination of short-term concentrated efforts and regular picking. Before and after large numbers of laborers go to the mountains for short-term concentrated efforts, organize a part of the labor force to regularly go to the mountains to pick. By adopting these two methods, we can ensure that both crops and mountain products can be harvested in a timely manner, and neither side will be delayed due to labor shortage.
    Seizing every opportunity requires leaders to be good at discovering and seizing gaps in work. Only by discovering and seizing the gaps can we organize forces in a timely manner and accurately insert the "needle." For this reason, we must have a comprehensive understanding of the "three autumns" work and the maturity of mountain products, and we must have a global perspective of recovering everything that is ripe. In this way, we can immediately organize another battle after the basic end of one battle without losing time. The Xinbin County Party Committee of Liaoning is doing just that. Xinbin County has already achieved great results in the concentrated picking of mountain products, and is now carrying it out in depth; it is estimated that this year's mountain product income will increase the income of the people of the county by more than 400,000 yuan. This is a huge wealth! It is hoped that all mountainous areas and areas with mountain product income can seize the source of wealth and increase wealth like Xinbin County.

### 让山货同庄稼一齐丰收

    让山货同庄稼一齐丰收
    秋天，多彩的季节，收获的季节。田地里，稻子一片金黄，棉花遍地雪白，谷子、玉米、甘薯、花生、芝麻发散出阵阵甜香；山坡上，紫色的葡萄摇摇欲坠，黄色的梨、红色的苹果和山里红沉甸甸地压弯枝条……。庄稼、果子都成熟了，召唤着人们去收获。
    收获，一切成熟了的东西都要收获回来。稻子、棉花、玉米、花生、芝麻……，是国家建设的物质力量，是人们生活的必需品，要丰产丰收，一个不丢地收回来；野葡萄、山梨、山里红、核桃等等野生山货，也都是人们生活中不可缺少的东西，也应当一个不丢地收回来。收回这些山货，不但可以给国家增加工业原料和副食品，丰富人们的生活，而且可以为公社和社员个人增加收入。
    在繁忙的秋收秋种秋耕季节，怎样才能保证庄稼和山货全部收回来呢？关键的问题仍然是合理安排、使用劳动力。在安排、使用劳动力的时候，要照顾到两个情况：一个是山货成熟以后，必须立即采摘，不采摘，果子就会腐烂掉落；另一个是“三秋”工作很繁重、紧迫，需要投入大量劳力才能完成任务。根据这种情况，两全其美的最好的办法便是“见缝插针”，即在“三秋”的某一项工作告一段落之后，抓紧时间，立即组织劳力上山突击采摘成熟的山货。同时，还可以采取短期突击和经常采摘相结合的办法，在大批劳力上山短期突击前后，组织一部分劳力，经常上山采摘。采取这两种办法，就可以保证庄稼和山货都能适时收获，两方面都不致因劳力紧张而耽误。
    见缝插针，需要领导者善于发现并抓住工作中的间隙。发现和抓住了间隙，才能及时地组织力量，准确地把“针”插下去。为此，必须对“三秋”工作情况和山货成熟情况有全面的了解，而且要有把一切成熟了的东西都收回来的全局观点。这样，才能在一次战役基本结束之后立即组织另一次战役，不失时机。辽宁新宾县委正是这样做的。新宾县突击采摘山货已经取得了很大的成绩，现在还在深入开展；预计今年的山货收入将为全县人民增加收入四十多万元。这是一笔巨大的财富！希望所有的山区和有山货收入的地区，都能像新宾县一样抓住财源，增加财富。
