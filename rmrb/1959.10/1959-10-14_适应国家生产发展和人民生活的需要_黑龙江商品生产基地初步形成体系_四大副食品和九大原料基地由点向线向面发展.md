Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 13th - In order to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people for non-staple foods, and to provide more raw materials and commodities for the development of light and chemical industries and national exports, Heilongjiang Province, while developing the diversified economy of people's communes and the self-sufficient production of organs and enterprises, is taking the approach of mobilizing all levels of the province, special districts, cities, counties, and people's communes to establish commodity production and supply bases for four major non-staple foods (pigs, vegetables, poultry, fish) and nine major raw materials (rosin, alkali nitrate, grass and reed pulp, iron pyrite, fur, silk, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, woven goods).

At present, Heilongjiang Province's commodity production base has initially formed a complete system and is developing towards the direction of connecting various bases into lines and linking large and small bases into networks. The province currently has more than one hundred and ninety state-owned commodity production bases established by the province, cities, and counties at all three levels. Among them, there are one hundred and fourteen pig and poultry farms mainly engaged in the development of non-staple food production by commercial departments, twelve state-owned vegetable farms, ten aquaculture farms mainly raising fish and ducks, as well as wildlife farms raising valuable animals such as nutrias and sables; there are also livestock bases engaged in diversified operations such as pigs and poultry based on the original state-owned farms by the agricultural departments; and there are also bases for forest chemical raw materials, etc., run by the forestry departments.

Among the more than one hundred and ninety state-owned commodity production bases, there are thirteen large-scale pig and poultry production bases and ten aquaculture farms directly under the province. These bases were proposed to be newly built and expanded at the Non-Staple Food Production Base Planning Conference convened by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee in August this year. These twenty-three non-staple food bases directly under the province, such as the Xigemu Livestock Farm in Jiamusi, the Xi'an Farm in Fujin County, the Limin Livestock Farm in Baiquan County, as well as the Maoxing Lake, Wudalianchi and other aquaculture farms, have built a number of pigsties and fish ponds, basically equipped with cadres, and started preparing materials and training personnel to manage pigs and poultry. Arrangements have also been made for the breeding livestock and feed needed by each base, and the fish fry needed by the aquaculture farms are being hatched themselves or captured in rice fields and shallow waters, and can be stocked in the farms in October.

All cities and counties in the province are also actively establishing non-staple food bases according to their own conditions and characteristics. For example, Qiqihar City has successively established seven pig and poultry bases in the suburbs of the city since 1957, raising more than 50,000 pigs, and has also built more than ten fishing grounds. In addition to the original seven large-scale vegetable bases, Jiamusi City has established three large pig farms this year under the responsibility of the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and the Bureau of Commerce. The cities and counties in the Mudanjiang area have also established thirty-nine non-staple food production bases.

The province has also established dozens of base counties for the production of non-staple foods and industrial raw materials. These base counties are determined according to the resource conditions and production characteristics of each place. They are commodity production bases collectively operated by the people's communes, but the commercial departments provide support and guidance in terms of funds, means of production, and production technology. In addition to self-sufficient production, the base counties can provide a certain amount of non-staple foods and industrial raw materials for the needs of the market and national exports every year. For example, ten pig-raising base counties such as Baiquan can provide 50,000 to 100,000 commercial pigs per county next year; this year, Heilongjiang Province successfully raised tussah silkworms, castor silkworms, and mulberry silkworms on a large area for the first time, harvesting 150,000 dan of silkworm cocoons, most of which were produced by seventeen silkworm raising base counties such as Mishan, Ning'an, Huachuan, and Zhaoyuan.

In recent years, these established commodity production bases at the provincial, municipal, and county levels have increasingly demonstrated their huge superiority in stabilizing the market and ensuring supply. This year, the commodities they provided accounted for 11% of the province's total purchases of pork, 33.5% of poultry, and about 10% of fish. Some non-staple food production bases in the suburbs of cities, because they can organize supply in a planned way and regulate the surplus and shortage of commodities in the market, have played the role of "living warehouses."

Heilongjiang Province began to establish commodity production bases at the end of 1956. Due to the rapid formation of Heilongjiang Province as one of the important industrial bases in the country after liberation, the urban population has increased sharply, and at the same time, the large-scale development of rural production has also improved the consumption level of farmers. Therefore, the needs of urban and rural people for non-staple foods have increased day by day. In order to adapt to this situation, the commercial departments started with the establishment of vegetable base counties, and successively started commodity production bases for non-staple foods such as pigs, poultry, and fish, as well as export materials such as fur and industrial raw materials, from 1957 to 1958 to ensure market supply and meet the needs of the people. Now, Heilongjiang Province is actively formulating a three-year development plan for the establishment of production and supply bases for four major non-staple foods and nine major raw materials with great ambition.

　　适应国家生产发展和人民生活的需要
    黑龙江商品生产基地初步形成体系
    四大副食品和九大原料基地由点向线向面发展
    据新华社哈尔滨13日电　为了满足城乡人民对副食品日益增长的需要，并为轻化工业的发展及国家出口提供更多的原料和商品，黑龙江省在发展人民公社的多种经营和机关企业自给性生产的同时，正采取省、专区、市、县和人民公社各级一齐动手的办法，建立四大副食品（猪、菜、禽、鱼）和九大原料（松香、碱硝、草苇纸浆、硫化铁矿石、毛皮、蚕、烤烟、麻、编织品）的商品生产供应基地。
    目前，黑龙江省的商品生产基地，已初步形成一个完整体系，并正在向着各种基地联成线、大小基地结成网的方向发展。全省现有省、市、县三级建立的国营商品生产基地共一百九十余处。其中有商业部门搞的以发展副食品生产为主的一百一十四处猪禽畜牧场，十二个国营蔬菜农场，十个以养鱼鸭为主的水产养殖场，以及饲养海狸鼠、紫貂等珍贵兽的野生动物场；有农业部门搞的以原有国营农场为基础，发展猪禽等多种经营的畜牧基地；也有林业部门搞的林产化工原料等基地。
    在一百九十余处国营商品生产基地中，有省属的规模较大的十三个猪禽畜牧生产基地和十个水产养殖场，这些基地，是今年8月中共黑龙江省委召开副食品生产基地规划会议中提出新建和扩建的。这二十三个省属副食品基地，像佳木斯西格木畜牧场、富锦县西安农场、拜泉县利民畜牧场等，以及茂兴湖、五大莲池等水产养殖场，都已建成了一批猪舍、鱼池，基本上配齐了干部，开始备料及培养训练管理猪禽的人员。各基地所需的种畜和饲料等也都作了安排，水产养殖场所需的鱼种正在设法自孵或在稻田、浅水面采捕，可以在10月份放养入场。
    全省各市、县也正在根据各自条件、特点，积极建立副食品基地。像齐齐哈尔市从1957年以来就陆续在市郊建立了七处猪禽基地，养猪五万余头，还建渔场十余处。佳木斯市除原有七处规模较大的蔬菜基地外，今年由市农业局、商业局负责又建立起三个大型养猪场。牡丹江地区各市县也已建立了三十九处副食品生产基地。
    全省还建立了几十个生产副食品和工业原料的基地县，这些基地县都是根据各地资源条件以及生产特点确定的。它们是由人民公社集体经营的商品生产基地，但商业部门在资金、生产资料和生产技术上给以扶植和指导。基地县每年除自给性生产外，能够为市场和国家出口需要，提供一定商品量的副食品和工业原料。像拜泉等十个养猪基地县，明年每县可提供五万到十几万头商品猪；今年黑龙江省第一年大面积放养柞蚕、蓖麻蚕、桑蚕成功，收获蚕茧十五万担，其中绝大部分就是依靠密山、宁安、桦川、肇源等十七个养蚕基地县生产的。
    几年来，这些已经建立的省、市、县各级商品生产基地，在稳定市场、保证供应等方面都愈来愈显示出它们的巨大的优越性。今年它们提供的商品，猪肉就占全省收购总数的11％，禽肉占33.5％，鱼占10％左右。有些市郊区的副食品生产基地，由于能够有计划地组织供应，调剂市场商品余缺，已经起到“活仓库”的作用。
    黑龙江省建立商品生产基地是从1956年底开始的。由于解放后，黑龙江省迅速形成为全国重要工业基地之一，城市人口急剧增长，同时农村生产大发展也提高了农民的消费水平，因此，城乡人民对副食品的需要量日益增长。为了适应这个情况，商业部门就从建立蔬菜基地县开始，在1957年到1958年陆续又搞起了猪、禽、鱼等副食品和毛皮等出口物资及工业原料的商品生产基地，以保证市场供应，满足人民需要。现在，黑龙江省正怀着雄心大志在积极制定建立四大副食品和九大原料生产供应基地的三年发展规划。
