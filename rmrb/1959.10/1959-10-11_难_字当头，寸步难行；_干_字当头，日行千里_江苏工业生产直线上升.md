Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 10th: The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of industrial secretaries, calling on all workers in the province to thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, continuously boost their enthusiasm, and strive to complete the annual industrial output value plan half a month ahead of schedule. Furthermore, they were urged to complete the leap forward plans for major products such as steel, coal, machinery, and pig iron five, ten, fifteen, and thirty days ahead of schedule, respectively.

Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xu Jiatun, Secretary, spoke at the meeting.

According to the meeting's analysis, the situation on Jiangsu's industrial front has been very good since August and September, and the potential is still great. After two months of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting enthusiasm, the workers' labor enthusiasm has risen to an unprecedented level, and production has risen straight upward, showing a continuous great leap forward situation of being higher each month and each ten-day period. The province's total output value in August increased by 17.7% compared to July, and in September it increased by 50% compared to August; the production of major products such as steel, iron, and coal has increased significantly. This thriving and vigorous situation has further inspired the high morale of cadres and workers in factories and mines throughout the province. They have summarized a valuable experience from the practice of these two months: When "difficulty" takes the lead, it's hard to move an inch; when "action" takes the lead, one travels a thousand miles. Therefore, on the basis of the great leap forward in September, various regions have continued to spur themselves on and put forward higher leap forward targets: the guaranteed total output value for the fourth quarter should be equivalent to 52.5% of the first three quarters.

The meeting emphasized that to complete the larger leap forward targets in the fourth quarter, it is necessary to continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly expose and criticize right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning activities, and thoroughly overcome right-leaning slackening. This remains an important task on the industrial and transportation fronts. The meeting cited a large number of facts to show that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, earnestly and thoroughly sweep away right-leaning thoughts, and summarize the experience of continuous leap forward, we can constantly find new potential. Take the comparison between Changzhou and Suzhou as an example. Historically, Changzhou's total industrial output value has always been much higher than Suzhou's; however, since the beginning of this year, due to Suzhou's full enthusiasm and the activation of cadres' and masses' initiative and creativity, industrial production has risen step by step and improved month by month. In May and June, it even broke the usual situation and caught up with Changzhou. These vivid facts powerfully criticized the right-leaning thoughts of a few cadres who believed that "potential has been exhausted, and the leap forward has reached its peak" and "October can only be a small jump, not a big jump," and strengthened the confidence and determination of all cadres attending the meeting to complete the leap forward plan ahead of schedule and above quota.

In order to seize the opportunity and strive to complete the annual leap forward plan half a month ahead of schedule, the meeting proposed several measures. First, launch a large-scale mass movement. In the fourth quarter, it is necessary to complete larger leap forward targets without increasing the number of workers. Therefore, the focus of the mass movement should be on improving enterprise management, improving operating techniques, and improving equipment, and mobilizing the masses to carry out a comprehensive technical revolution and technical innovation. Second, take effective measures, seize the solution of practical problems, oppose empty talk of difficulties and shrinking back, and advocate vigorous and practical work. In particular, it is necessary to grasp the supply of raw materials and fuels, emphasize the spirit of self-reliance, rationally organize comprehensive utilization, and do everything possible to increase production and practice economy. Third, further strengthen leadership over transportation work. Improve transportation efficiency by organizing rational transportation, strengthening cooperation between departments, strengthening the loading and unloading capacity of stations, ports, factories, and mines, and accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships. The materials needed for the first quarter of next year should be shipped as early as possible in the fourth quarter, so that transportation work can keep up with the pace of the great leap forward. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership over short-distance transportation work, and carry out mass short-distance blitz transportation campaigns in a planned and led manner. Fourth, universally use the method of comparison and ranking to organize large-scale competitions, continuously promote and continuously organize new upsurges in production and construction.

Regarding the issue of industry better supporting agriculture, the meeting put forward the following specific requirements. From now on, it is necessary to seize the time to prepare the necessary agricultural machinery, farm tools, pesticides, and fertilizers for winter and spring water conservancy construction and spring sowing and planting next year. The agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment that needs to be repaired in rural areas should be arranged immediately and repaired and assembled in advance. It is necessary to actively develop commune-run industries to better serve the great development of agricultural production.

The meeting also made preliminary studies on how to prepare for production next year, especially in the first quarter. The meeting requested that the production plan for the first quarter of next year be prepared in advance, and the allocation and production of materials and equipment be specifically arranged. It is necessary to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair. All conditions that can be prepared should be prepared in November. For some products with long production cycles, materials should be put into production as early as possible, and it should be resolutely ensured that the production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year.

The industrial secretaries of the local party committees, municipal party committees, and county party committees who attended the meeting enthusiastically responded to the call of the provincial party committee and expressed that they would use a faster speed and complete the plan 20 days to one month ahead of schedule to ensure the realization of the provincial party committee's call.

　　“难”字当头，寸步难行；“干”字当头，日行千里
    江苏工业生产直线上升
    新华社南京10日电　中共江苏省委最近召开了工业书记会议，号召全省职工彻底反右倾、不断鼓干劲，力争提前半个月完成全年工业产值计划，并且分别提前五天、十天、十五天、三十天，完成钢、煤、机械、生铁等主要产品的跃进计划。
    中共江苏省委第一书记江渭清、书记许家屯，在这次会议上讲了话。
    根据会议分析，8、9月以来，江苏省工业战线上的形势十分好，潜力仍然很大。经过两个月来的反右倾、鼓干劲，职工群众的劳动热情空前高涨，生产直线上升，出现了一月比一月高、一旬比一旬高的继续大跃进局面。全省8月份总产值比7月份增长17.7％，9月份又比8月份增长50％；钢、铁、煤等主要产品的生产，都有大幅度的增长。这种蒸蒸日上、蓬勃发展的形势，更加激励了全省厂矿干部和职工的昂扬斗志。他们从这两个月的实践中，总结出了一条宝贵的经验：“难”字当头，寸步难行；“干”字当头，日行千里。因此，在9月份大步跃进的基础上，各地又继续加鞭，提出了更高的跃进指标：第四季度保证完成的总产值要相当于前三个季度的52.5％。
    会议强调指出，要在第四季度完成更大跃进的指标，必须继续贯彻党的八届八中全会决议精神，彻底揭发和批判右倾思想和右倾活动，彻底克服右倾松劲现象。这仍然是目前工业交通战线上的一项重要任务。会议列举大量事实，说明只要坚持政治挂帅，认真地彻底地扫清右倾思想，总结继续跃进的经验，就可以不断找到新的潜力。以常州与苏州两个市的对比为例。历年来常州市的工业总产值一向比苏州市高得多；可是今年以来，由于苏州市鼓足了干劲，发挥了干部和群众的积极性、创造性，工业生产步步上升，月月提高，5、6两月份甚至突破历来的常情，赶到了常州市的前面。这些鲜明的事实，有力地批判了少数干部认为“潜力挖尽，跃进到顶”“10月份只能小跳，不能大跳”的右倾思想，坚定了全体到会干部提前和超额完成跃进计划的信心和决心。
    为了抓紧时机，力争提前半个月完成全年跃进计划，会议提出了几项措施。一，大搞群众运动。第四季度要在不增加工人的条件下，完成更大的跃进指标。因此，群众运动的重点应放在提高企业管理水平、改进操作技术、改进设备这三个主要的方面，并且发动群众全面进行技术革命和技术革新。二，采取有效措施，抓紧解决实际问题，反对空喊困难、畏缩不前，提倡轰轰烈烈、切切实实地干。特别要抓好原料材料和燃料的供应工作，强调发扬自力更生精神，合理组织综合利用，千方百计地厉行增产节约。三，进一步加强对交通运输工作的领导。从组织合理运输，加强各部门的协作，加强车站、港口、厂矿的装卸力量，加速车船周转等方面，提高运输效率。明年第一季度需要的物资，尽可能提早在第四季度启运，使运输工作也跟上大跃进的步伐。与此同时，还要加强对短途运输工作的领导，有计划、有领导地开展群众性的短途突击运输运动。四，普遍地运用对比排队的方法，组织大比大赛，不断促进，不断地组织新的生产和建设高潮。
    关于工业更好地支援农业的问题，会议提出了以下具体要求。从现在开始，要抓紧为今冬明春兴修水利和明年春播春种，准备好必需的农业机械、农具、农药和化肥，对于农村需要修配的农业排灌设备，要立即安排，提前把它们修理、配套好。要积极发展社办工业，更好地为农业生产的大发展服务。
    会议对于如何做好明年特别是第一季度的生产准备工作，也作了初步研究。会议要求提前编好明年第一季度的生产计划，具体地安排物资和设备的调拨生产。要加强设备维护检修。凡是能准备好的条件，都争取在11月份准备好。有些生产周期长的产品，要及早投料，坚决做到明年第一季度的生产水平不低于今年第四季度。
    到会的各地委、市委和县委的工业书记，都热烈地响应省委的号召，纷纷表示要用更快的速度，以提前二十天到一个月完成计划的成绩，来保证省委号召的实现。
