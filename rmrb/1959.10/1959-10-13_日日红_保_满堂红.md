　　“Daily Red” Guarantees “All-Round Red”
　　Chu Xue
　　Before National Day, many factories and mines put forward the slogan of "Good Start, Daily Red, All-Round Red." Now, many enterprises have broken the "routine" of high output at the end of the month and low output at the beginning of the month, and have fought a beautiful battle in early October, realizing the bold promise of a "Good Start." The current task is to advance victoriously, ensure "Daily Red," and achieve "All-Round Red"—to overfulfill the October plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill the annual plan ahead of schedule.
　　"All-Round Red" is built on the foundation of "Daily Red." To achieve "All-Round Red" in October, we must rely on 31 days of daily overproduction and daily high quality. To complete this year's production plan ten to fifteen days, or even more, ahead of schedule, we must ensure that the output of various products rises steadily by ten-day periods. Daily overproduction is the basis for guaranteeing overproduction by ten-day periods; only with daily overproduction can we have an absolutely reliable guarantee of completing the monthly and annual plans ahead of schedule. Now there are only two months left until the end of the year. We must not have the slightest slack; the situation requires us to seize every minute and second, to achieve high output and high quality every day, so that each ten-day period's production is higher than the last, and each production upsurge is higher than the last.
　　Some people worry: Isn't it too tense to fight for every minute and second every day? These comrades do not understand that it is truly tense when the daily plan is not completed and production is in arrears. One of the characteristics of industrial production is that "one step leads to the next, one link is connected to the next." Completing the plan ahead of schedule today creates conditions for better completion of the plan tomorrow; falling behind today will increase the burden on tomorrow's production. In the past, some enterprises did not seize the beginning of the month and then rushed at the end of the month. Wasn't everyone up and down very nervous? To avoid this kind of tense situation, we must take "striving for the front and not falling behind, striving to take the initiative" as our guiding ideology. We must seize the beginning of the month and seize every day. If every shift in this ten-day period does not fall behind and overproduces every day, we can take the initiative in the next ten-day period and overproduce even better; if we complete the plan ahead of schedule this month, we can leap forward more actively next month; if we complete the annual plan ahead of schedule this year, we can prepare for next year's production in a timely manner, so that next year we can continue to make a great leap forward.
　　Whether it is tense or not also depends on whether the working methods are correct. We advocate striving for daily overproduction, not to have everyone exert physical strength. The main means of overproduction is to adhere to putting politics in command and mobilizing the masses to carry out technological innovation. As long as everyone opposes right-leaning tendencies, boosts energy, uses their brains, finds tricks, and improves equipment and production technology, and at the same time, makes clever arrangements in terms of progress and is diligent in inspection and comparison, output will be multiplied several times, so what "tension" is there?
　　The workers on the industrial front have never been willing to slack off, but prefer the tense and happy struggle of seizing every minute and second. As long as the enterprise leaders firmly grasp the daily plan, we can certainly complete the annual plan ahead of schedule in one go and achieve "All-Round Red" for the whole year excellently.

### “日日红”保“满堂红”

　　“日日红”保“满堂红”
　　楚雪
    国庆节前，许多厂矿企业提出了“开门红、日日红、满堂红”的口号。现在，很多企业打破了月末高、月初低的“常规”，在10月上旬打了漂亮仗，“开门红”的豪言壮语实现了。当前的任务是要乘胜前进，确保“日日红”，实现“满堂红”——提前超额完成10月份的计划，提前超额完成全年的计划。
    “满堂红”建立在“日日红”的基础上。10月份的“满堂红”，要靠三十一天日日超产，天天优质。要提前十天到十五天、甚至更多的时间完成今年的生产计划，就要使各种产品的产量按旬稳定地上升。而日日超额是保证按旬超额的基础；只有日日超额，提前完成月计划和年计划才有绝对可靠的保证。现在到年底，只有两个多月的时间了。我们决不能有丝毫的松懈，形势要求我们争分夺秒，日日高产优质，使一旬的生产高过一旬，使生产高潮一浪高过一浪。
    有人担心：天天争分夺秒，岂不太紧张？这些同志不了解，日计划完不成，产量欠下来，那才真紧张。工业生产的特点之一，就是“一步连一步，一环扣一环”。今天超额完成了计划，就为明天更好地完成计划创造了条件；今天欠了账，会为明天的生产增加负担。过去有的企业月初不抓紧，到了月末再突击，不是上上下下都很紧张吗？要避免这种紧张现象，就要以“赶前不赶后，努力争主动”作为指导思想。月初就要抓紧，天天都要抓紧。这一旬班班不欠账，天天都超产，下一旬就能主动出击，更好地超产；这个月提前完成了计划，下个月就能更加主动地跃进；今年提前超额完成了年计划，就能及时为明年的生产做好准备，使明年继续大跃进。
    紧张不紧张，还要看工作方法是否对头。我们主张力争天天超产，并不是要大家拼体力，超产的主要手段在于坚持政治挂帅，发动群众大闹技术革新。只要人人反右倾、鼓干劲，动脑筋，找窍门，改进了设备和生产技术，同时，在进度上巧作安排，勤于检查和评比，产量就会几成、几倍地翻上去，这还有什么“紧张”呢？
    工业战线上的职工们从来不愿意松懈，而是喜欢争分夺秒的紧张愉快的斗争的。只要企业领导人员紧紧地抓日计划，我们肯定无疑地可以一鼓作气大大提前超额完成年计划，出色地实现全年“满堂红”。
