    The golden sunlight shines on the capital's art scene, with a riot of colors and a garden full of fragrance. The Liberation Army Amateur Performance Team, along with professional artists from art groups in Beijing, participated in the tribute performances celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

    In this amateur performance team, there are officers and soldiers, from different combat posts, from all directions. The programs they perform are excellent programs selected from the All-Army Second Literary and Art Performance, and are the results of the great leap forward in mass amateur literary and art activities in the army. Their performances are full of combativeness and mass character, overflowing with full political enthusiasm and a strong atmosphere of military life. In general, they use rich and varied art forms to compose a paean to the Great Leap Forward.

    Their dance programs include the powerful "Celebrating the General Line" and the inspiring "Leap Forward War Drums." "Giant Dragon Galloping" makes people feel as if they are in a magnificent and heroic steel line, singing and dancing for the flow of molten steel; the red lantern dance "People's Commune Flowers Bloom" leads people into a beautiful poetic realm, with light singing and dancing, expressing the happy and joyful mood of the working people. Several dances reflecting military life strongly display the heroic spirit and brave and tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Army. "Red Flag Planted on Height 424" portrays fearless heroic figures and shows a victorious battle scene. "Military Saber Dance," with flashing sabers and galloping horses, recreates the majestic posture of the mighty cavalry galloping on the vast grasslands. "Morning on the East Sea" cleverly shows the fierce air battle. Teams of "Silver Swallows," facing the bright morning glow, swiftly and fiercely annihilate enemy planes, defending the clear skies of the motherland. In the imaginative dance "Night at the Reservoir," countless lights, like stars in the sky, reflect the tense and joyful flow of people, as if it were a labor lyric poem, writing about the passion of the Chinese people in building socialism.

    The music programs include magnificent choruses and lyrical folk songs. There is the versatile one-person performance of "Blowing, Hitting, Pulling, and Singing," as well as the instrumental ensemble "East Sea Fisherman's Song" with reed pipes and drums sounding together. The performance singing: "Our Company Clerk is Extremely Busy," vividly depicts the leap forward scene of the company; "Always Smiling" humorously sings the comfortable mood of the working people. In the self-written and self-performed "Six Great Members," the announcer, hygienist, telephone operator, typist, and childcare worker, use their own experiences to sing about their glorious duties; in the Uyghur song "Welcoming the National Day," ethnic minority soldiers cheerfully sing about the motherland and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and wish him boundless longevity.

    "Battlefield Music" is an even more unique and wonderful program. The heroic soldiers of the Volunteer Army, during the breaks in battle, used wine bottles, iron boxes, bullet casings, and captured enemy steel helmets to form a victory symphony containing endless power. The sound is like gold and jade, and the spirit runs through the rainbow, making the entire theater resonate with the strongest sound of revolutionary optimism. At the sound of an attack order, the heroic soldiers, with the belief in victory, throw themselves into a new battle. This extraordinary performance aroused strong resonance from the audience.

    The performance team's programs also include humorous crosstalk "A Riot of Color Around the Barracks," "A Letter," and antiphonal dialogue "Ten Years on the Island," vividly reflecting the army's Great Leap Forward and expressing the people's soldiers' determination to defend and build the motherland. You can also see: the "Singing the Commune During Festivals," with folk art colors, singing and dancing, showing a prosperous scene of abundant harvests and longevity; the statue performance "Fighting at the Ming Tombs," like beautiful oil paintings, depicts the construction site scene of soldiers and civilians uniting and working together.

    There is also a form of collective recitation, which is a combination of poetry and drama, and is a deeply moving program. "Unforgettable Voyage" tells the story of Chairman Mao living with the sailors on the voyage, truly expressing the soldiers' love for the leader. "Under the Old Pear Tree" reflects the internationalist friendship between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people, as close as flesh and blood. "Remembering General Yang Jingyu" describes the inseparable relationship between the "Anti-Japanese United Army" and the people of Northeast China, profoundly expressing the glorious tradition of unity between the army and the people. These moving poems all have a high artistic conception, sincere feelings, vivid images, and lively language, full of passion and revolutionary romanticism, and are very popular with the audience.

    In short, after watching their performances, I was encouraged in the appreciation, which naturally reminded me of the beautiful poem "Sun-facing flowers and trees are easy to usher in spring." The reason why the Liberation Army Amateur Performance Team's tribute programs are so rich and varied is that the army has implemented the Party's policy of literature and art serving proletarian politics, serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy, which has achieved victory. It is the flower and fruit that the Party's literary and art policy has opened and borne, and it is the Party's rain and dew that nourishes and irrigates the flowers of amateur literature and art, which are flourishing and exuding a rich fragrance.

　　跃进人唱跃进歌
　　——赞解放军业余演出队的献礼演出
　　虞棘
    金色的阳光照耀着首都艺苑，百花斗艳，满园芬芳。解放军业余演出队，和在京艺术团体的专业文艺工作者一道，参加了庆祝建国十周年的献礼演出。
    在这支业余演出队伍里，有军官，有士兵，来自不同的战斗岗位，来自四面八方。他们演出的节目，是全军二届文艺会演选拔出来的优秀节目，是部队群众性业余文艺活动大跃进的成果。他们的演出，富有战斗性、群众性的特色，洋溢着饱满的政治热情和浓郁的部队生活气息，总的看来，他们是用丰富多采的艺术形式组成了大跃进的颂歌。
    他们的舞蹈节目：有气势磅礴的“欢庆总路线”；有振奋人心的“跃进战鼓”。“巨龙飞奔”，使人宛如置身于雄伟豪迈的钢铁行列，为钢水奔流而纵情歌舞；红灯舞“人民公社鲜花开”，又把人引进了优美的诗一般的意境，轻歌曼舞，表达了劳动人民幸福愉快的心情。几个反映部队生活的舞蹈，强烈地展示了人民军队的英雄气概和勇敢顽强的战斗精神。“红旗插上四二四高地”，刻划了大无畏的英雄群像，展现了胜利的战斗图景。“军刀舞”，刀光闪闪，万马奔腾，再现了威武的骑兵驰骋在广阔草原上的雄姿。“东海的早晨”，巧妙地表现了激烈的空战，但见：队队“银燕”，迎着灿烂的朝霞，风驰电掣地痛歼敌机，捍卫着祖国的万里晴空。在富有想像力的舞蹈“水库的夜晚”里，数不尽的灯火，犹如天上繁星，掩映着紧张而愉快的人流，仿佛是一首劳动抒情诗，写出了中国人民建设社会主义的激情。
    音乐节目，有雄壮的大合唱，也有抒情的民歌。有多面手一人表演的“吹、打、拉、唱”，也有笳鼓齐鸣的器乐合奏“东海渔歌”。表演唱：“咱连的文书忙得不得了”，生动地描绘了连队的跃进景象；“永远乐呵呵”，富有风趣地唱出了劳动人民的舒畅心情。在自编自演的“六大员”里，广播员、卫生员、电话员、打字员、保育员，现身说法，歌唱着自己的光荣职务；在维语演唱“迎接国庆”里，少数民族战士欢快地歌唱祖国、歌唱各民族的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。
    “战地音乐”，更是一个具有独特风格的精采节目。志愿军的英雄战士们，在战斗的空隙，利用酒瓶、铁盒、弹壳和缴获敌人的钢盔，组成了蕴含着无穷力量的胜利交响乐，声如金玉，气贯长虹使整个剧场回荡着革命乐观主义的最强音。一声出击令下，英雄的战士们，又带着胜利的信念投入了新的战斗。这场不平凡的演奏，引起观众强烈的共鸣。
    演出队的节目，也有幽默的相声“万紫千红绕营房”、“一封信”和对口词“进岛十年”，生动地反映了部队的大跃进和表达了人民战士保卫祖国、建设祖国的决心。还可以看到：具有民间艺术色彩的“时逢佳节唱公社”，载歌载舞，展现了人瑞年丰的繁荣景象；塑像表演“战斗在十三陵”，像一幅幅美妙的油画，把军民团结共同劳动的工地场景描绘了出来。
    还有一种集体朗诵的形式，是诗和戏剧的结合，是感人至深的节目。“难忘的航行”，叙述了毛主席和水兵们在航程中一起生活的故事，真实地表达了战士们热爱领袖的心情。“老梨树下”，反映了志愿军和朝鲜人民情同骨肉，亲如手足的国际主义友谊。“怀念杨靖宇将军”，描写了当年“抗联”部队和东北人民血肉不可分离的关系，深刻地表现了军民一致的光荣传统。这些动人的诗篇，都有着较高的意境，真挚的感情，鲜明的形象，生动的语言，充满着激情和革命浪漫主义的色彩，深受观众欢迎。
    总之，看了他们的演出，在欣赏中得到鼓舞，使我自然地联想到“向阳花木易为春”这句美丽的诗。解放军业余演出队的献礼节目之所以如此丰富多采，是部队贯彻执行党的文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务和“百花齐放”的方针所取得的胜利，是党的文艺方针开的花、结的果，是党的雨露滋润着、灌溉着业余文艺的花朵，欣欣向荣的散发着浓郁的馨香。
