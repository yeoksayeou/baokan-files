Xinhua News Agency, 20th: More than 6,000 spectators in the capital watched a rare, intense, and tense international basketball friendly match at the Beijing Gymnasium tonight. After twelve ties, the agile and fast Beijing men's basketball team defeated the visiting Bulgarian national men's basketball team with a narrow advantage of 82 to 79, only three points ahead.

With just over a minute remaining in the game, the score was tied at 77. At this point, the Beijing team defended tightly, grabbed the ball, and launched an attack. First, Qian Chenghai scored a goal with an accurate jump shot, taking a 79-77 lead. Subsequently, Fu Ruide, the Beijing team's two-meter center, made a free throw, changing the score to 80-77. Then, Yang Boyong, a scoring expert for the Beijing team, scored again, taking an 82-77 lead by five points. Yang Boyong was very active today, scoring 23 points, accounting for more than a quarter of the team's total score. Despite the dwindling time, the Bulgarian team, with its tenacious counter-attack, finally saw newly substituted center Yagoridkov (No. 6) score a goal, resulting in the final score of 79-82.

At the beginning of the game today, the Beijing team's defensive circle was too small, and the opponent continuously scored with mid-range shots. After only three minutes, the visiting team took a commanding lead of 11-3. Later, the Beijing team strengthened its defense and launched fast breaks. Wang Lifa, Yang Boyong, Qian Chenghai, Ju Fenkang, Zhang Xishan, and others continuously scored with layups, free throws, or shots, narrowing the gap. By the fourteenth minute, they had caught up to 24-23, taking a one-point lead. However, Milchev, the Bulgarian team's two-meter-one center, was very active under the basket. The Beijing team would carelessly allow him to score or commit a foul while trying to grab the ball, resulting in free throws. The visiting team's score repeatedly took the lead (the visiting team led 56 times throughout the game, while the Beijing team led 22 times). At the end of the first half, the Bulgarian team again took a one-point lead with a score of 37-36.

The competition was even more intense in the second half. The score fluctuated back and forth. The audience applauded and cheered the wonderful performances of both sides.

The Bulgarian national men's basketball team has already played seven friendly matches in our country, resulting in five wins and two losses. They are about to go to Shanghai and prepare to hold a friendly match with the Shanghai men's basketball team there on the 22nd.

Furthermore, the Bulgarian men's basketball team defeated the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" men's basketball team in Beijing on the evening of the 18th, with a score of 70 to 66.

    保男篮在京一胜一负
    战胜“八一”队　败给北京队
    据新华社20日讯　首都六千多名观众今晚在北京体育馆观看了一场罕见的激烈、紧张的国际篮球友谊赛，灵活、快速的北京男子篮球队同保加利亚国家男子篮球队打了十二次平局以后，才以八十二比七十九仅三分的优势战胜了客队。
    在这场比赛还剩最后一分多钟时，场上的比分还是七十七平。这时，北京队严密防守，抢到球后就展开进攻，首先由钱澄海以准确的跳起单手投篮的动作投中一球，以七十九比七十七领先。随后北京队身高两米的中锋符瑞德又罚中一球，场上比分变成八十比七十七。接着北京队得分能手杨伯镛又投中一球，以八十二比七十七领先五分。杨伯镛今天打得很活跃，当时他已经得了二十三分，占全队得分总数四分之一以上。尽管离终场时间越来越短，但顽强反攻的保加利亚队最后仍然由新换上场的中锋雅戈里德科夫（6号）投入一球，形成了七十九比八十二的最后局面。
    北京队今天开头由于防守圈缩得太小，被对方连续用中距离投篮命中得分，才打了三分多钟，客队就以十一比三遥遥领先。后来北京队加强了防守并发动快攻，王利发、杨伯镛、钱澄海、鞠汾康、张锡山等人切入上篮或罚球、投篮连续得分，到第十四分钟时追成了二十四比二十三领先一分的局面。但保加利亚队身高两米零一的中锋米尔契夫在篮下十分活跃，北京队一不小心就被他投中得分或因抢球犯规被他罚中，客队得分仍然多次领先（全场客队领先五十六次，北京队二十二次）。上半场结束时，保加利亚队又以三十七比三十六取得了领先一分的优势。
    下半场双方争夺更是激烈。场上比分一会你超过我，一会我又超过你。观众不时为双方精采的表演连声鼓掌、喝采。
    保加利亚国家男子篮球队已经在我国进行了七场友谊比赛。结果五胜二负。他们即将去上海，准备22日在那里同上海男子篮球队举行友谊赛。
    又讯　保加利亚男子篮球队18日晚在北京曾战胜了中国人民解放军“八一”男子篮球队，比数是七十比六十六。
