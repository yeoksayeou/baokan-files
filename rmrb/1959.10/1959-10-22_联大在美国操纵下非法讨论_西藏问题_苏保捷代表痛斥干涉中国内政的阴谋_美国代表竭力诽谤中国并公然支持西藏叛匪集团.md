Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 21st: Under the planning and control of international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism, the United Nations General Assembly began an illegal discussion of the so-called "Tibetan issue" on the 20th. Representatives from fifteen countries, including Malaysia, Ireland, the Soviet Union, and the United States, spoke at the meeting.

    Soviet delegation leader Kuznetzov delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, sharply exposing the conspiracy to force the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue," and stated that the Soviet delegation firmly opposed discussing the so-called "Tibetan issue" at the United Nations and would vote against the slanderous proposal put forward by the delegations of Ireland and Malaysia.

    Bulgarian representative Tarabanov also spoke against the United Nations General Assembly discussing the so-called "Tibetan issue." He pointed out that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and forcing the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the "Tibetan issue" is an interference in China's internal affairs. He said that the United Nations should have enough strength to oppose attempts to use the United Nations to endanger the cause of peace.

    Czechoslovak representative Nosek pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "Tibetan issue" could only poison the international atmosphere, and he demanded that this harmful discussion be stopped.

    Nepalese representative Upadhyaya said that Nepal would not vote in favor of the proposals of Ireland and Malaysia, and believed that the United Nations' discussion of the "Tibetan issue" would only harm the improvement of international relations. He said that Tibet is currently undergoing social reforms, and demanding that the United Nations take action would in reality "be tantamount to maintaining a social status quo, which now has no merit and can no longer be maintained."

    The main organizer of this discussion, U.S. representative Lodge, made a lengthy speech at the meeting, desperately peddling the U.S. attempt to use the so-called "Tibetan issue" to stir up anti-China hysteria and poison the international atmosphere. He expressed strong support for the slanderous proposals put forward by Malaysia and Ireland, and concealed the fact that the U.S. State Department was the fabricator of this proposal. Because representatives from many countries were dissatisfied with the U.S.'s brazen violation of the United Nations Charter by forcing the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the "Tibetan issue," Lodge first distorted the United Nations Charter in his speech, refuting those who opposed and doubted, insisting that the General Assembly was "qualified" to discuss the "Tibetan issue," and said that the United States believed that the General Assembly's "power" to pass the slanderous proposal put forward by the delegations of Malaysia and Ireland was "undoubted."

    Lodge then used his habitual technique of spreading rumors and slander, desperately distorting the truth, and slandering the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion of the Tibetan traitorous upper-class reactionary group as a "movement to destroy the freedom, religion, and way of life of the Tibetan people," and "a very serious violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms." In this regard, Lodge cited the various "statements" issued in Tezpur and Mussoorie in the name of the Dalai Lama, as well as the notorious "report" of the so-called International Commission of Jurists. At the same time, Lodge also openly stated that the U.S. government "wholeheartedly" supported the Tibetan bandit group, supported the Tibetan serf owners, and whitewashed the barbaric and dark serf system, attacking the democratic reforms that freed the Tibetan people from the shackles of slavery as "deception, blasphemy, and plunder." He frantically attacked, saying, "This cannot be said to be progress, nor can it be said to be reform, but only a crime that the civilized world will not forget."

    Malaysian representative Kamil, who played the role of a clown in the U.S.-planned anti-China conspiracy, also babbled like his master in his speech, spreading the lie that "the Tibetan people are being subjected to cruel oppression and suppression." Kamil clamored that the General Assembly had a moral responsibility to record its judgment on "cruel violations of human rights in Tibet" in the name of "justice" and "humanity," and "if this General Assembly should ignore the events in Tibet, its silence on this matter can only be interpreted as condoning the destruction of those principles it guarantees to uphold." At the same time, Kamil also tried to stir up suspicion and hostility among Asian and African countries towards China, saying that "the People's Republic of China's brutal violation of human rights in Tibet is a matter for moral consideration by the Asian and African people who support the spirit of the Bandung Declaration."

    Another U.S. lackey, Irish Foreign Minister Aiken, also echoed the worn-out tune of China's "violation of human rights," and advocated that the United Nations should not "remain silent." He absurdly described the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet and the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet as "turning back the clock of the whole world," and said that "a sound world public opinion must be established, which is strong enough to stop illegal actions like those that have occurred in Tibet."

    Representatives from countries such as Pakistan, New Zealand, and Australia sang the same tune as the U.S. representative in their speeches, uttering vicious slanders against the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion in Tibet.

    Pakistani representative Ali Khan said in his speech that Pakistan felt "great unease" about the so-called "unfortunate events in Tibet." He was dissatisfied with the fact that the broad masses of the Tibetan people had risen up to overthrow the barbaric and dark serf system, and nonsensically said that "the practice of changing their traditional way of life is a violation of their basic human rights." Ali Khan expressed support for the reactionary proposals of Ireland and Malaysia.

    New Zealand representative Shanahan and Australian representative Plimsoll both uttered vicious slanders against the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion of reactionary elements in Tibet and the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet, saying that this was a "large-scale violation of human rights and insult to human dignity," and that "what happened in Tibet was brutal and was imposed on the Tibetan people." They supported the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Tibetan issue.

    Belgian representative Loridan said that the United Nations Charter did not authorize this world organization to interfere in matters that purely fall within the scope of internal affairs. However, he repeated the slanderous clichés against China, saying that "there is sufficient evidence to show that human rights in Tibet have been trampled upon." He said that Belgium would abstain from voting.

    French representative Bélar said that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Tibetan issue risked violating Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter. He said that regardless of whether using the terms sovereignty or suzerainty or other terms of China, it seemed that there was indeed a "relationship of subordination" between Tibet and China. He said that this situation had made the countries that proposed the "Tibetan issue" proposal feel embarrassed. At the same time, the French representative also said that he did not doubt the so-called "magnanimous intentions" of Ireland and Malaysia in submitting this proposal. He said that France would abstain from voting.

    Finnish representative Enckell said that, like many representatives, he also had "serious doubts" about whether the United Nations General Assembly had the right to discuss the Tibetan issue. He said that if the General Assembly voted on the proposal paragraph by paragraph, Finland would vote in favor of those "paragraphs containing general declarations, but not those containing specific references to the situation in Tibet."

    Representatives from Cuba and Brazil, in their speeches, expressed support for the proposals of Ireland and Malaysia on the grounds of safeguarding "human rights."

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session discussed the so-called "Tibetan issue," which was deliberately manufactured and forced upon the United Nations General Assembly, on the morning and afternoon of the 20th. This issue was placed on the agenda of the General Assembly under the pressure of the U.S. delegation. But although the U.S. delegation obtained a formal majority in placing the "Tibetan issue" on the agenda of the General Assembly, the discussion at the morning meeting on the 20th convincingly showed that the vast majority of representatives recognized that this was a provocative "issue."

    The U.S. delegation's attempt to invigorate the discussion was in vain. The delegations of more than a dozen countries that favored placing the "Tibetan issue" on the agenda of the General Assembly, including the delegations of Pakistan, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Panama, did not attend the morning meeting on the 20th. Most delegations sent only second-level representatives to the meeting.

    Only a few reporters were sparsely scattered in the press gallery. The representatives of Malaysia and Ireland, who proposed the "Tibetan issue" proposal, were forced to enter the empty meeting hall. Their proposal violated the United Nations Charter and brutally interfered in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. Their attempt to have the United Nations General Assembly pass this proposal was met with a cold reception.

    联大在美国操纵下非法讨论“西藏问题”
    苏保捷代表痛斥干涉中国内政的阴谋
    美国代表竭力诽谤中国并公然支持西藏叛匪集团
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：在以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派的策划和把持下，联合国大会全体会议20日开始非法地讨论所谓“西藏问题”。在会上发言的有马来亚、爱尔兰、苏联和美国等十五个国家的代表。
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫在会上作了长篇发言，尖锐地揭露了强使联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”的阴谋，并且声明苏联代表团坚决反对在联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”并将投票反对爱尔兰和马来亚代表团提出的诽谤中国的提案。
    保加利亚代表塔拉巴诺夫也发言反对联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。他指出，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，硬要联合国大会讨论“西藏问题”是对中国内政的干涉。他说，联合国应有足够的力量反对利用联合国来危害和平事业的企图。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克指出，联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”只能毒化国际气氛，他要求停止这个有害的讨论。
    尼泊尔代表乌帕德亚亚说，尼泊尔将不投票支持爱尔兰和马来亚的提案，并且认为联合国讨论“西藏问题”只会危害国际关系的改善。他说，西藏现在正处在社会改革期间，要求联合国采取行动实际上“可能等于要维持一种社会现状，而这种现状现在已毫无可取之处，而且已不能再维持下去”。
    这次讨论的主要组织者美国代表洛奇在会上作了冗长的发言。竭力兜售美国企图利用所谓“西藏问题”来掀起反华歇斯底里以及毒化国际气氛的阴谋。他表示大力支持马来亚和爱尔兰提出的诽谤中国的提案，并且掩饰美国国务院是这个提案的泡制人。由于许多国家的代表对于美国强使联合国大会讨论“西藏问题”这个粗暴违反联合国宪章的无耻行径感到不满，洛奇在发言中首先曲解联合国宪章，反驳那些反对和怀疑的意见，硬说大会“有资格”讨论“西藏问题”，并且说美国认为大会通过马来亚和爱尔兰代表团提出的诽谤中国的提案的“权力是无可怀疑”的。
    洛奇接着施展他造谣诬蔑的惯技，竭力歪曲事实真相，诽谤中国政府平定西藏卖国的上层反动集团的武装叛乱是“破坏西藏人民的自由、他们的宗教和他们的生活方式的运动”，“非常严重的侵犯人权和基本自由的行为”。在这方面，洛奇引证了以达赖喇嘛名义在提斯浦尔和穆索里发表的历次“声明”以及臭名远扬的所谓国际法学家委员会的“报告”。洛奇同时还公开表示美国政府“全心全意地”支持西藏叛匪集团，支持西藏的农奴主，并且粉饰野蛮黑暗的农奴制度，攻击使西藏人民摆脱奴隶枷锁的民主改革是“欺骗、亵渎神灵和掠夺”。他疯狂地攻击说，“这不能说是进展，也不能说是改革，而只能说是文明世界不会忘记的一种罪行。”
    在美国策划的反对中国的阴谋中充当跳梁小丑的马来亚代表卡米尔在发言中也像他的主子一样满嘴胡说，散布所谓“西藏人民遭到残酷的压迫和镇压”的谎言。卡米尔叫嚷说，大会有道义的责任，以“公理”和“人道”的名义记录下它对“在西藏残酷地侵害人权”的判决，“如果这个大会竟然忽视在西藏的事件，它对这件事的缄默只能解释为纵容破坏它保证要维护的那些原则。”卡米尔同时还力图煽起亚非国家对中国的怀疑和敌视，说什么“中华人民共和国在西藏粗暴地侵犯人权，是赞成万隆宣言精神的亚非人民进行道义上的考虑的问题”。
    美国的另一走卒爱尔兰外交部长埃肯也重弹所谓中国“侵犯人权”的滥调，鼓吹联合国不要“保持沉默”。他荒唐地把中国政府平定西藏上层反动集团的武装叛乱和在西藏进行民主改革说成是“把全世界的时钟倒转了”，并且说什么“必须建立健全的世界舆论，它强大得足以阻止像在西藏发生的那种违法行动。”
    巴基斯坦、新西兰和澳大利亚等国家的代表在发言中同美国代表一鼻孔出气，对中国政府平定西藏的武装叛乱发出恶毒的诬蔑。
    巴基斯坦代表阿里汗在发言中扬言巴基斯坦对所谓“西藏的不幸事件”感到“很大不安”，他不满意西藏广大人民群众起来推翻野蛮黑暗的农奴制度，胡说什么“改变他们的传统生活方式的做法是侵犯他们的基本人权”。阿里汗表示支持爱尔兰和马来亚的反动提案。
    新西兰代表夏纳汉和澳大利亚代表普利姆索尔在发言中都对中国政府平定西藏反动分子的武装叛乱和在西藏进行民主改革发出恶毒诬蔑，他们说什么这是“大规模的侵犯人权和污辱人类的尊严”，在西藏“发生的事情是粗暴的，并且是强加在西藏人民身上的”。他们支持联合国大会讨论西藏问题。
    比利时代表洛里丹说，联合国宪章没有授权这个世界组织来干涉纯粹属于内政范围的问题。但是，他又重复诬蔑中国的滥调说，“有足够的证据说明西藏的人权遭到了蹂躏”。他表示比利时在投票时将弃权。
    法国代表贝拉尔说，联合国大会讨论西藏问题有违反宪章第二条第七款的危险。他说，不管是用中国的主权或宗主权或者其他的名词，看来在西藏和中国之间的确存在着“附属的关系”。他说，这种情况曾使提出“西藏问题”提案的国家感到为难。同时，法国代表又说，他并不怀疑提出这个提案的爱尔兰和马来亚的所谓“豁达的意图”。他表示法国将在投票时弃权。
    芬兰代表恩克尔说，和许多代表一样，他也对联和国大会是否有权讨论西藏问题存在“严重的怀疑”。他说，如果大会对提案进行逐段表决，芬兰将投票赞成那些“包含一般性宣言的段落，而不赞成那些包含具体提到西藏局势的段落”。
    古巴和巴西的代表在发言中以所谓维护“人权”为理由，表示支持爱尔兰和马来亚的提案。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议20日上午和下午讨论了故意制造的和硬要联合国大会讨论的所谓“西藏问题”。这个问题是在美国代表团的压力下列入大会议程的。但是尽管美国代表团在把“西藏问题”列入大会议程一事上得到了形式上的多数，然而在20日上午会议上的讨论却令人信服地表明，绝大多数代表都认识到这是个挑衅性的“问题”。
    美国代表团企图使讨论活跃起来的做法徒劳无功。十多个赞成把“西藏问题”列入大会议程的国家的代表团，其中包括巴基斯坦、玻利维亚、厄瓜多尔和巴拿马等国的代表团，都没有出席20日的上午会议。大多数代表团只派了第二级代表出席会议。
    在记者席上稀稀落落只有很少一些记者。提出“西藏问题”提案的马来亚和爱尔兰的代表不得已地步入空荡荡的会场。他们提出的提案违背联合国宪章，粗暴地干涉中华人民共和国的内政。他们要求联合国大会通过这项提案的做法遭到冷遇。
