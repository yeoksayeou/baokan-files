    Patriots Are Innocent
  　Xiao San
    It's been more than twenty years. Not long after the heroic Chinese Red Army completed the 25,000-li Long March through thousands of mountains and rivers and victoriously arrived in northern Shaanxi, our Second Revolutionary Civil War had not yet ended, but a high tide of resistance against Japanese aggression was brewing and rising across the country. When the material living conditions of the border region's army and people were still very difficult, the inaugural issue of "Liberation," the organ of our Party Central Committee, published articles by our Party and army leaders, expressing solidarity with the heroic Spanish Republican Army and sympathizing with and supporting the Spanish revolutionary army and people in their unyielding struggle against the armed intervention of international fascism and the cruel oppression of domestic reactionary forces. The song "Defend Madrid" resounded throughout China. - We still remember all of this very clearly.

    Due to the disparity in strength, the Spanish Republican Army was defeated. The reactionary dictator has ruled on Spanish soil to this day. For more than twenty years, the Spanish people have been in dire straits. The whole of Spain has become a huge prison: two hundred thousand patriots are imprisoned, and the prisons are overcrowded. All domestic democracy and freedom have been completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of Spanish patriots have been forced into exile. I know many such Spanish writers, poets, and people from all walks of life who have been in exile for a long time. Seeing their children growing up, they - the older and younger generations - still cannot return to their motherland. - What an inhumane thing this is happening on our planet today!

    The reactionary forces always think that the more severe the suppression and slaughter, the more completely the revolutionary movement will be eliminated. In fact, the opposite is true. The reactionary dictatorial rulers of Spain have run rampant for more than twenty years, but the domestic revolutionary movement has not stopped. On June 18th of this year, a peaceful general strike was held throughout Spain, demanding that the ruling authorities change their policies. But the authorities have intensified their efforts, adopting even more cruel means of suppression to deal with the peaceful patriotic people, and arresting large numbers of striking workers and democratic progressive elements. Simon Sanchez Montero, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, was also arrested and sentenced to twenty years in prison. …

    We appeal to justice, we appeal to conscience. This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue. We firmly support the completely legitimate and just sacred demands of the Spanish people: - "Amnesty for all imprisoned and exiled political prisoners!" Let the Spanish people take a breath after a long period of suffocation! Patriots are innocent! Soldiers who fight for national independence and the happiness of the people are innocent! Let hundreds of thousands of Spanish exiles return to their land, their homeland - their motherland! The Chinese people, who have won independence and freedom through arduous struggle, have always stood, now stand, and will always stand with Spanish patriots and all democratic progressives. Peace-loving, just, and democratic people all over the world stand with you.

    爱国者无罪
  　萧三
    离现在二十多年了。当英勇的中国红军经过千山万水完成二万五千里长征并胜利地到达陕北之后不久，我们的第二次国内战争还没有结束、但在全国已经酝酿和掀起了抵抗日本侵略的高潮、边区军队和人民的物质生活条件还非常困难的时候，我们党中央的机关刊物“解放”的创刊号上就发表了我们党和军队领导同志们的文章，声援英雄的西班牙共和军，同情、支持西班牙革命军民反抗国际法西斯对他们的武装干涉和国内反动势力对他们的残酷压迫的不屈不挠的斗争。“保卫马德里”的歌声响遍了全中国。——这些都是到现在我们还记得清清楚楚的。
    由于力量悬殊，西班牙共和军失败了。反动独裁者在西班牙这块土地上统治直到如今。二十余年来西班牙人民处在水深火热之中。整个西班牙成为了一座庞大的监狱：二十万爱国者被关在狱里，有人满之患。国内一切民主自由都摧残尽净。成千上万的西班牙爱国者被迫流亡国外。我认识不少这样长期流亡在外的西班牙作家、诗人和其他各界人士。眼看他们的子女都长大成人了，但是他们——前辈和后代——直到现在还不能回到自己的祖国去。——这是我们今天地球上一种多么惨无人道的事情！
    反动势力总以为镇压屠杀越凶，革命运动就会完全消灭。事实上却得其反。西班牙反动独裁统治者横行了二十余年，但是国内的革命运动并没有停止。今年6月18日西班牙全国举行了和平总罢工，就是为了要求统治当局改变自己的政策。但当局反而变本加厉，采取了更加残酷的镇压手段来对付和平爱国的人民，大批逮捕罢工工人和民主进步分子。西班牙共产党中央政治局委员西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗也被捕并被判处二十年徒刑。……
    我们向正义呼吁，向良心呼吁。这种不能容忍的事不能再让它继续下去了。我们坚决支持西班牙人民完全正当的、正义的神圣的要求：——“大赦所有被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯！”让西班牙人民在长期窒息之后透过一口气来吧！爱国者无罪！为国家独立、人民幸福而斗争的战士无罪！让成千上万的西班牙流亡者回到自己的土地、自己的故乡——祖国去！经过艰苦斗争而获得独立自由的中国人民，从前、现在和将来永远和西班牙爱国者及一切民主进步人士站在一道。全世界的爱好和平、正义、民主的人们和你们站在一道。
