    When You Receive a Letter from Afar…
    Li Huiwen
    If you have a relative, an old comrade-in-arms, or an old colleague working far away, how much you must look forward to their letters! When you finally receive a letter from them, when you gaze at the familiar handwriting on the envelope with a joyful heart, preparing to open it, have you ever thought about who has quietly labored for your joy?
    In the past, people called postal workers "green-clad messengers." Today, they no longer wear green uniforms; their hearts are bright red, they are red messengers! Please take a look at the story of Luo Shuzhen, a female postal worker and young Communist Party member from the Beijing Post Office:
    In May 1951, sixteen-year-old Luo Shuzhen began riding her bicycle, going through streets and alleys to deliver letters and newspapers to people. Each time she completed her task and returned, she felt especially relaxed and happy. But the delivery work was not as simple as she had imagined, and a small test came. One day, she was delivering the last batch of letters when it suddenly turned dark and a fierce storm broke out. She didn't have a raincoat, and her clothes were immediately soaked, and the bicycle light was blown out by the wind. She hid in a doorway, hesitating. What to do? Go back? There were still letters that hadn't been delivered, how could she explain? Not go back? How could she bear to ride a bicycle in such a stormy, dark night to deliver letters? But when she thought about how people were waiting for her to deliver the letters, and that perhaps there was something important in those letters, she finally gritted her teeth, braved the wind and rain, and, using the light of the street lamps, went through alley after alley, delivering the last few letters.
    After Luo Shuzhen experienced this storm test, she began to realize that delivery work was not simple, but very arduous. In the future, she would often have to go out in wind and rain, and no matter what the situation, she would have to deliver letters and newspapers several times a day, as accurately as a clock. Therefore, she felt a burden in her mind. At this time, the Party branch encouraged her, telling her that doing revolution means overcoming difficulties, not being afraid of difficulties, and that difficulties can be overcome. Luo Shuzhen listened to the Party's words, her confidence increased, her courage grew, and she felt full of strength. She plunged into the intense work with vigor again.
    Some young delivery workers who had just started working were not settled in their jobs, were emotional, and said that delivery work, even if done for a lifetime, was just about memorizing street numbers, delivering letters, and delivering newspapers, without any prospects. This argument impacted Luo Shuzhen, causing her to question herself: How do I view delivery work? Am I willing to do delivery work for a lifetime? She felt that her thoughts were not very clear. However, the experience of actual work helped her obtain the correct answer.
    Day after day of hard work, frequent contact with all kinds of people, gradually made Luo Shuzhen realize how important the delivery work is in socialist construction, in people's work and life. When she delivered newspapers to the office and saw several cadres waiting for the newspapers at the door, when she delivered letters to an old lady and saw a comforting smile on her wrinkled face, she increasingly felt her responsibility was great. Letters and newspapers in her eyes were no longer simply black words on white paper, but gradually became living things, "A letter is a heart!" Luo Shuzhen linked her heart with the hearts of the people, and when she saw people happy to receive letters, she also felt happy. Once, Luo Shuzhen delivered a letter to an old lady at No. 4, Lian'er Hutong, Xijiaominxiang. The letter was sent from Tianjin. The old lady was illiterate, but she was very eager to know what the letter said. Luo Shuzhen read the contents of the letter to her, and the old lady was very happy after listening. She said gratefully to Luo Shuzhen: "You are such a good girl, always thinking of us, thank you so much!" She kept sending Luo Shuzhen to the door and watched her walk away before going back. Luo Shuzhen was very moved after returning, and kept thinking about this matter for a long time. Why do people welcome me so much? Who says delivery work is just about memorizing street numbers, without any prospects? As long as people can receive letters from their loved ones a day earlier, and see the newspapers a little earlier, knowing the new face of the motherland, which is progressing a thousand miles a day, what does it matter if I suffer a little? Giving convenience to others is my greatest happiness!
    One summer evening, when Luo Shuzhen was delivering letters halfway, it suddenly started to rain. She quickly wrapped the dozens of letters that had not been delivered tightly with oilcloth, and pedaled her bicycle forward with all her might. When she arrived at the door of a household in Xiao'ertiao, and called out "Mail," an old lady came out with an umbrella. Seeing that Luo Shuzhen was soaked, but the letters were dry, the old lady was very moved and quickly said, "Good girl, come into the house to avoid the rain, you are still delivering letters in this weather, be careful not to catch a cold." "Thank you, grandma, no need." "Or, lend you a raincoat to wear." "No. There are only a few more houses to deliver, goodbye!" She got on her bike and disappeared in a blink of an eye.
    Zhang Congyi, a coastal defense soldier, after reading Luo Shuzhen's model deeds in the newspaper, wrote a letter to Luo Shuzhen, asking her to find his old classmate Zhai Fulai, who had not been in contact for seven years. The address that Zhang Congyi could provide was only "somewhere near Nancheng Gen outside Chaoyangmen," but he believed that Luo Shuzhen would definitely find him. Luo Shuzhen accepted this commission. She realized from Zhang Congyi's sincere letter how eager this soldier defending the motherland was to find his good friend, and how eager he was to understand the situation in the capital. She was determined to find this Zhai Fulai. But where to find him? Chaoyangmen was not within her delivery area. "Finding a friend for a coastal defense soldier," this belief encouraged Luo Shuzhen. She used her spare time to ride her bicycle to Chaoyangmen again and again, braving the scorching heat, looking for one alley after another, asking residents everywhere, flipping through the household registration books of the police station, but there was no clue at all. Two or three months passed, but the three words Zhai Fulai kept turning in her mind, and she couldn't let it go. One day, Luo Shuzhen was helping another delivery worker sort out letters, and suddenly found a letter addressed to Zhai Fulai of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union. She jumped up happily and immediately called the Municipal Trade Union. Upon asking, there was indeed a Zhai Fulai there. She immediately rode her bicycle, braving the rain, and rushed to the Municipal Trade Union, handing Zhang Congyi's letter to Zhai Fulai in person. In this way, two old classmates who had not been in contact for seven years resumed contact.
    Last year, she was assigned to a group with more errors. Luo Shuzhen shared her experience in eliminating errors with everyone, and often studied and analyzed the causes of errors with everyone. She also provided key assistance to comrades who made more errors. Fu Chenglin had more than sixty errors in 1957 alone. Luo Shuzhen found that he was very flustered when working, and did not look at the address carefully when sorting letters. For example, within his section there were the "Supreme People's Procuratorate" and the "Supreme People's Court," and he often sent letters from these two units to each other by mistake. Luo Shuzhen helped him specifically analyze the causes of the errors, telling him to see the addressee's address and name at a glance. With Luo Shuzhen's patient help, Fu Chenglin's delivery quality improved quickly. In 1958, he only made three errors throughout the year, and in 1959 he has not made any errors so far.
    When she finds suspicious letters, Luo Shuzhen studies them with everyone. Once, when sorting letters, she found a letter that was clearly written "No. 29 Middle School." Everyone else said it was No. 29 Middle School, but she felt that the size of the "2" and "19" did not match, and the postmark was stamped on the "2." She suspected that a horizontal line of the "3" was covered by the postmark, so she found a magnifying glass and looked closely. It was indeed a "3."
    Dear readers, when you read letters from afar, when you read your subscribed newspapers and periodicals, please think of comrades like Luo Shuzhen. Day and night, they ride their bicycles, braving the scorching heat and severe cold, going through streets and alleys, diligently delivering the news of the motherland's Great Leap Forward, and delivering the warm greetings of relatives.

    当你收到一封远方来信的时候……
    李汇文
    如果你有一个亲人或是一位老战友、老同志在远方工作，你会多么盼望他们的来信！当你终于收到他们的一封信的时候，当你带着愉快的心情，凝视着信封上熟悉的笔迹准备拆开它的时候，你有没有想到谁曾经为你的喜悦默默地付出了劳动呢？
    过去，人们曾把邮递员称作“绿衣使者”。今天，他们已经不穿绿色的制服；他们的心是鲜红的，他们是红色的信使！请你看一下北京市邮局女投递员、青年共产党员罗淑珍的故事吧：
    1951年5月，十六岁的小姑娘罗淑珍开始骑着自行车，穿过大街小巷给人们送信送报了。每次完成了任务回来，她都感到特别轻松愉快。但是投递工作并不像她所想像的那样简单，一个小小的考验降临了。有一天，她正在送最后一班信，这时天刚黑，突然来了狂风暴雨。她没有带雨衣，身上的衣服马上就被淋湿，车灯也让风吹灭了。她躲在一个门洞里，犹豫起来。怎么办？回去吧，还有信没有送完，怎么交待？不回去吧，在这样狂风暴雨的黑夜还要骑车子送信，怎么受得了？但当她想到人们正在等着她把信送去，也许这些信里有什么要紧的事的时候，她终于一咬牙，冒着风雨，借着路灯的光芒，穿过一条条胡同，送完了最后几封信。
    罗淑珍在经过这次风雨的考验以后，开始体会到投递工作并不简单，而是很艰苦的，今后要经常风里来，雨里去，不管什么情况，都要一天几次，像钟表那样准确地给人们送信送报，因此她思想上有了负担。这时党支部鼓励了她，告诉她干革命就是要克服困难，不要怕困难，困难是能够战胜的。罗淑珍听了党的话，信心足了，勇气大了，好像浑身充满了力量。她又朝气勃勃地投入了紧张的工作。
    有一些刚参加工作的年轻投递员不安心工作，闹情绪，说投递工作做到老也是跑路数门牌，送送信，送送报，没出息，这种论调冲击着罗淑珍，使她不由得向自己提出了疑问：我是怎样看投递工作的？我是不是愿意干一辈子投递工作呢？她觉得自己的思想好像也并不很明确。但是，实际工作的体验帮助她获得了正确的解答。
    一天又一天的辛勤劳动，同各色各样的人们频繁的接触，使罗淑珍逐渐认识到投递工作在社会主义建设中，在人民的工作和生活中，具有多么重要的作用。当她送报到机关去，看到有好几个干部在门口等着报纸时，当她把信送到老太太手里看到那布满皱纹的脸上浮起宽慰的笑容时，她愈来愈感觉到自己的责任重大，信件和报纸在她的眼里，已经不单纯是白纸黑字，而逐渐变成了有生命的东西，“一封信就是一颗心啊！”罗淑珍把自己的心和人民的心联在一起了，看到人家接到信高兴，她也觉着高兴。有一次，罗淑珍给西交民巷辇儿胡同四号一位老太太送信，这封信是从天津寄来的。老太太不识字，但很急切的想知道信里说的什么。罗淑珍就把信的内容念给她听，老太太听完了很高兴，感激的对罗淑珍说：“你这个姑娘太好了，处处为我们着想，真太感谢你了！”一直把罗淑珍送到门外，看她走远了才回去。罗淑珍回去后很感动，久久地想着这件事。人们为什么这样欢迎我？谁说投递工作是数门牌，没出息，只要能让人们早一天接到亲人的信，早一点看到报纸，知道祖国一日千里的新面貌，自己吃点苦又算得了什么？给别人方便，不就是自己的最大幸福吗？
    一个夏天的傍晚，罗淑珍送信到半途的时候，忽然天下起雨来了，她连忙把没有送完的几十封信用油布包紧，又使劲蹬车前进。当她走到小二条一家住户门口，喊声“收信”时，一位老太太打着伞走了出来，看到罗淑珍浑身都湿透了，但信却是干的，老太太很感动，连忙说：“好姑娘，快到屋里避避雨吧，这天气你们还送信，看淋坏了身子。”“谢谢老大娘，不用了。”“要不，借件雨衣给你穿吧。”“不。没有几家就送完了，再见吧！”她骑上车，转眼就不见了。
    海防战士张从义，从报纸上读到罗淑珍的模范事迹后，给罗淑珍写来了一封信，请她找一找七年不通音信的老同学翟福来。张从义所能提供的地址，只是“朝阳门外南城根一带”，但他相信罗淑珍一定会找到。罗淑珍接受了这个委托。她从张从义的诚恳的信里体会到：这个保卫祖国的战士是多么渴望找到自己的好朋友，多么渴望了解首都的情况。她下决心要找到这个翟福来。但是到哪里去找？朝阳门外也不是她的投递范围。“为海防战士找到朋友”，这个信念鼓舞着罗淑珍。她利用业余时间一次又一次冒着酷热，骑车到朝阳门外，找了一条胡同又一条胡同，到处向居民打听，翻遍了派出所的户口簿，可是没有一点儿线索。时间过去了两三个月，但是，翟福来三个字却始终在她脑子里打转，怎么也放不下。有一天，罗淑珍帮助另一个投递员整理信件，忽然发现了一封寄给北京市工会翟福来的信，她高兴的跳起来，连忙打电话给市工会，一问，是有个叫翟福来的，她立刻骑上车子，冒雨赶到市工会，把张从义的信亲手交给了翟福来。就这样，两位七年不通音信的老同学又恢复了联系。
    去年，她被分配到一个差错比较多的小组工作，罗淑珍就把自己消灭差错的经验教给大家，并经常和大家一起研究分析发生差错的原因，对出差错多的同志，还进行重点帮助。傅成林1957年一年就发生六十多件差错。罗淑珍发现他在工作时很慌，排信不详细看清楚地址。比如他的段内有“最高人民检察院”和“最高人民法院”，他就老把这两个单位的信互相送错。罗淑珍帮助他具体地分析了出差错的原因，告诉他收信人地址和姓名要一眼看到底。傅成林在罗淑珍的耐心帮助下，投递质量提高很快，1958年全年只发生了三件差错，1959年到现在一直没有发生差错。
    发现有疑难的信，罗淑珍就和大家一起研究。有一次在排信时，她发现一封信上面写的很清楚是“二十九中”，让别人看也都说是二十九中，但她觉得“二”字和“十九”两字大小不相称，在“二”字上面又盖了邮戳，她怀疑是否“三”字被邮戳盖住了一横，于是找来放大镜，仔细一看，的确是“三”字。
    亲爱的读者们，当你们读着远方来信，读着订阅的报刊的时候，请你想一下罗淑珍这样的同志吧，他们朝朝夕夕，骑着车子，冒着酷热和严寒，穿过大街小巷，勤勤恳恳地传递着祖国大跃进的消息，传递着亲人们热情的问候。
