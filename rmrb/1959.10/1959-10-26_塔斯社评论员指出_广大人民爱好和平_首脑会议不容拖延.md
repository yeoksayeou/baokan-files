    TASS Commentator Points Out
    The Broad Masses of People Love Peace; Summit Meeting Cannot Be Delayed

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 25th, TASS dispatch from Moscow on October 24th: TASS commentator Yegorov writes: Soviet Minister of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev's successful visit to the United States, has had such a huge impact on the current warming of the international climate, that it has made people believe that a meeting of heads of state of East and West will open up a road to completely eradicate the "Cold War" that everyone detests. Faithful to its policy of peace, the Soviet government has repeatedly advocated convening a summit meeting, believing that such a meeting would help improve relations between countries and consolidate universal peace. Heads of government who enjoy high prestige among the people and have the necessary power can solve major international problems that hinder the peaceful and friendly coexistence of all peoples.

    The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to convene a meeting of heads of government and is prepared to participate in such a meeting. The Soviet government believes that the sooner a high-level meeting is convened, the more beneficial it will be to the cause of peace.

    The Soviet government's position is already very clear, but there have been contradictions in the Western countries regarding the date of the high-level meeting. US President Eisenhower believes that such a meeting could be held in early December this year. The French government believes that this meeting can only be held in the spring of next year. The British Foreign Office stated that the meeting should be held earlier than the spring of next year.

    France's position has been criticized by many Western newspapers. "The Times" wrote that Londoners believe that by postponing the high-level meeting by several months, "the opportunity to improve East-West relations may be missed."

    The excuse for trying to postpone the high-level meeting until the spring of next year is that "thorough preparations" must be made. Of course, it is necessary to prepare for such an important meeting. However, it must not be forgotten that there is a force in the world that opposes the emerging detente and attempts to use every opportunity to hinder the rapprochement between East and West. The broad masses of people demand peace, and they will not agree to delay such an important meeting as the meeting of heads of government of East and West.

    争取缓和局势　打击“冷战”势力
    塔斯社评论员指出
    广大人民爱好和平  首脑会议不容拖延
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社莫斯科24日电：塔斯社评论员叶戈罗夫写道：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫成功地访问美国，对目前国际气候的转暖起了如此巨大的影响，它使人们相信，东西方政府首脑举行会谈，将会开辟出一条道路来完全铲除大家都厌恶了的
  “冷战”。忠实于和平政策的苏联政府不止一次地倡议召开最高级会议，它认为，这种会见有助于改善各国之间的关系和巩固普遍和平。在人民群众中享有很高威信并拥有必要权力的政府首脑，能够解决妨碍各国人民和平友好相处的重大国际问题。
    苏联政府认为，召开政府首脑会议是必要的，它准备参加这种会议。苏联政府认为，高级会议越早召开，对和平事业就越有益处。
    苏联政府的立场已经十分明确，而西方国家在召开高级会议的日期上却发生了矛盾。美国总统艾森豪威尔认为，可以在今年12月初举行这种会议。而法国政府认为，只有在明年春天才能召开这种会议。英国外交部声明，会议应当在比明年春季更早的时候举行。
    法国的立场遭到许多西方国家报纸的批评。“泰晤士报”写道，伦敦人士认为，由于把高级会议推迟数月，“可能错过这次改善东西方关系的机会”。
    企图把高级会议推迟到明年春季举行的借口是，必须进行“周密的准备”。当然，举行这样重要的会议是必须准备的。但是，不能忘记，世界上有一种势力反对开始出现的局势的和缓，企图利用一切机会阻碍东西方接近。广大人民群众要求和平，他们不会同意拖延举行像东西方国家政府首脑会议这样重要的会议。
