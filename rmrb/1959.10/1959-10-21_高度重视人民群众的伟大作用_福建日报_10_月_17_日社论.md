Fujian Daily Editorial, October 17

Reading the recent newspapers, what unfolds before us is a picture of a sky full of red clouds and brilliant golden light, a scene of leaping progress. From the whole country to Fujian, the great battles of August and September have yielded remarkable results, and the initial battles of the fourth quarter are achieving splendid success. Our socialist construction is continuing to leap forward at a rapid pace. Here, agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest, with production increasing by several times or even doubling. There, industrial production and construction have grown exponentially compared to the same period last year, with the Five-Year Plan, this year's plan, and monthly plans being completed ahead of schedule. Where do these inspiring great achievements come from? It is because the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party brought tremendous heat, sweeping away the small gust of cold wind stirred up by a handful of right-leaning opportunists; it is because the broad masses of people, under the guidance of the Party's General Line and the call of the Eighth Plenary Session, have exerted full effort, and unleashed infinite wisdom and boundless strength. In this regard, these brilliant and enormous achievements have summarized a fundamental experience for us in building socialism, that is, in socialist construction, we must fully estimate the wisdom and strength of the people, and fully unleash the people's enthusiasm, seeing both the physical things and, more importantly, the people. After the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued Great Leap Forward this year, this important experience has been recognized and utilized by more people, becoming an important weapon for us to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The various fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists who distrusted the masses, feared the masses, and slandered the masses have been shattered by the tremendous strength displayed by the broad masses. But even today, are there still some people who underestimate the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in building socialism, who only see the physical things and not the people, or who see the physical things more than the people? Yes, for example, some places, when formulating plans or accepting tasks, only calculate the "physical" accounts, but not the immeasurable accounts of the people, saying that they lack this and that; blaming this condition for being bad and that condition for being unfavorable. Because they cannot see the enthusiasm and wisdom of the people, cannot see the subjective initiative of the people, what is placed before them is only a pile of "physical" difficulties, lacking confidence in overcoming difficulties and continuing the Great Leap Forward. Without continuing to overcome this right-leaning thinking, we cannot fully unleash the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to complete the Great Leap Forward plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and we cannot carry out socialist construction at a high speed.

The people are the creators of history, the masters of history. Fully acknowledging the great role of the people, treating revolutionary mass movements with full enthusiasm, and highly promoting the creativity and initiative of the people, this is the most important and fundamental difference between our proletarian party, proletarian revolutionaries, and bourgeois parties, bourgeois revolutionaries. Our victories in revolution and construction have been achieved under the leadership of the Party, through mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. Our Party and Chairman Mao highly value the role of the people. "Six hundred million people, all are like the sage kings of antiquity," is our leader's assessment of the great people. Chairman Mao wrote when introducing the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Henan: "Apart from the leadership of the Party, the six hundred million people are a decisive factor." Comrade Liu Shaoqi also said in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "Things are done by people, and the subjective initiative of the people is a great driving force. Ignoring this great driving force would be running counter to Marxism-Leninism." The General Line for socialist construction, formulated by the Party by concentrating the will of the broad masses of the people, has opened up an infinitely broad path for the unleashing of the enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese people in building socialism. The essence of the General Line is the high regard for the people's consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity in the cause of building socialism. "Going all out, aiming high," is to fully unleash the great subjective active role of the 650 million people.

The countless facts since the Great Leap Forward, which have shaken the world, even more eloquently demonstrate the great role of the people. Isn't it true that our Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture mainly relies on the enthusiasm of the people? Taking agriculture as an example, as everyone knows, our technical and material conditions in agriculture are very poor. Although agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers have increased with the development of industry, they are still very limited. However, the speed of our agricultural development far exceeds that of the major capitalist countries. The head of the imperialist camp, the United States, has many more times the agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers than our country, but from 1949 to 1958, the United States' grain output only increased by 25%, an average annual increase of only 2.5%, while in our Great Leap Forward year of 1958 alone, it increased by 35%, exceeding the total of the United States for ten years. To take a recent example, the early rice in Xianyou County this year only had an average of ten catties of chemical fertilizer per mu, and no tractors, but they had a bumper harvest, with the unit yield not increasing by 2% or 3%, but by a strong 22%. Such a growth rate as Xianyou's is not an isolated case in the whole province; and in many places with serious difficulties, where the "physical" conditions are extremely poor, production has also increased rapidly. Everyone can see that Pingtan County, with its undulating hills, barren land, and frequent wind and drought disasters, has such harsh natural conditions, but their early rice unit yield has increased by 57%, and due to the transformation of natural conditions and the expansion of rice planting area, the total output has increased fourfold. What do they rely on for their bumper harvest? They rely on the leadership of the Party, on the People's Communes, and on the enthusiasm of the masses; without water, they build water conservancy projects; without mechanical construction, they rely on manpower; when labor is insufficient, they think of ways to reform tools; without chemical fertilizer, men, women, old and young accumulate farm manure and create local chemical fertilizer... We have a superior social system. The transformation of the new relations of production from cooperatives to People's Communes has brought about an unprecedented liberation of productive forces, fully unleashing the role of people. And the United States' decadent social system hinders the development of productive forces, and the working people there are exploited and oppressed. Even with good "physical" conditions, they can never reach our current speed of development. Their functions are greatly restricted. The agricultural situation is like this, and so is the industrial situation. To give a small example, the Fuzhou Machine Tool Factory, last year, most of the lathes they used were old lathes left over from the Mawei Shipyard, which was established by Zuo Zongtang in 1866. Some even had the year number "Tongzhi" branded on them. In the eyes of people who "see the physical things and not the people," these conditions were too bad, and these pieces of equipment should have been scrapped long ago. However, enthusiastic workers can transform these unfavorable conditions, refitting the old lathes, and using these lathes to produce a large number of machines with quite high precision, such as machine tools, water turbines, and paper-making machines. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, although our economic situation was also good, and the total industrial output value increased greatly compared with the same period last year every month, due to the mischief of the right-leaning thinking of a small number of cadres, it once affected the enthusiasm of the masses, and the output of some products in June and July even decreased compared with the previous months. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Party called for "anti-rightism, boosting morale," and people's enthusiasm was immediately boosted. The objective material conditions hardly changed, but a huge productive force emerged from the horizon with the boosting of morale. Production rose in a straight line, and many difficulties that were previously considered unsolvable were quickly resolved. The total industrial output value of the province increased by 16.8% in August compared with July, and then surged by 56.8% in September compared with August. For example, the completion of the timber production plan had not been very good in the past few months. As soon as anti-rightism and morale-boosting began in August, production immediately increased. August increased by 34% compared with July, and September even increased by more than double compared with August, completing the annual plan more than three months ahead of schedule. Isn't this another good medicine for those with right-leaning thinking?

Enthusiasm, that is, the subjective initiative of people. The relationship between people and things is also the relationship between subjective initiative and objective laws, the relationship between the subjective and the objective, which are opposed to each other and also unified. We acknowledge objective conditions, but we also believe that people can understand, grasp, and change objective conditions. When certain objective conditions are met, the subjective active role of people, that is, people's enthusiasm, becomes the decisive factor, "Things are done by people," "Man will conquer nature." Social struggle is like this, and so is the struggle against nature. The material conditions such as tools and machines used in production are created by people, and the technology is mastered by people. Therefore, we must first see the role of people. Real life is like this: with the same conditions, different enthusiasm leads to different results; even factories with good equipment and technology, due to insufficient enthusiasm, produce things that are inferior to factories with poor equipment, technology, and sufficient enthusiasm; fertile farmland, due to the lack of enthusiasm of the owner, yields less than barren land with an enthusiastic owner. Some people, lacking enthusiasm themselves, say that they respect objective conditions, respect material conditions, and say that they proceed from reality. In fact, they only see the role of objective conditions, and ignore or underestimate the enthusiasm and role of the people; they are not the masters of objective conditions, but the slaves of objective conditions; the "reality" in their eyes only has "things," but no "people"; and the "things" in their eyes are static, rigid, and unchangeable. This is mechanical materialism and metaphysics in philosophy, and from a political point of view, it is a manifestation of distrusting the masses. Among these people, some have fallen into the quagmire of right-leaning opportunism, and one of the fundamental reasons is that they do not recognize the initiative and active role of the people in the cause of building socialism, they cannot see the strong will, great strength, and rich wisdom of the working people who have been liberated from the old system and are building a new socialist system. Our socialist construction is the cause of tens of thousands of people themselves. Without unleashing the initiative and creativity of the people, there will be no vigorous socialist construction, and there will be no true socialist cause. Of course, to do a good job in economic work, we must respect objective economic laws, but we maximize the subjective initiative of people precisely in order to fully utilize economic laws.

Seeing both people and things, considering both objective conditions and fully estimating the great role of the masses, this is the correct attitude of materialists. Comrades engaged in leadership work, when analyzing the situation, formulating plans, and completing tasks, should see the "physical" conditions, but more importantly, they should see the role of people, estimate the huge potential hidden in the masses, and treat the enthusiasm and creativity of the people with full enthusiasm; they should consider the human conditions in connection with the material conditions, and recognize that through human effort, unfavorable conditions can become favorable conditions, and favorable conditions can become even more favorable. However, fully estimating the potential of the masses is only the first step in solving the problem for leaders. Leaders should also take practical measures to fully unleash the enthusiasm of the masses, so as to produce the greatest effect. Our Great Leap Forward is an organized revolutionary action. We cannot rely on the spontaneous enthusiasm of each mass, but we need to organize and educate them to continuously improve the consciousness of the masses. Therefore, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, break superstitions, emancipate the mind, engage in mass movements, enthusiastically commend the advanced, plant red flags everywhere, organize and carry out socialist labor competitions, so that the broad masses can fully unleash their enthusiasm and creativity under the guidance and encouragement of the General Line. To unleash the role of people, political and ideological work alone is not enough, and meticulous organizational and economic work is also needed; for example, jointly formulating advanced plans and measures with the masses, so that the masses have clear goals to strive for; rationally organizing and arranging labor; continuously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, and solving problems in the work at any time; correctly implementing the socialist principle of distribution according to work, and caring about the lives of the masses, etc. Without these scientific and concrete measures in these aspects, it is easy to frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses, or to get half the result with twice the effort, or not to be sustainable.

As long as we take politics as the commander and soul, combine political work with economic work, and combine political education of the masses with material incentives, we can mobilize the enthusiasm of thousands of people and organize the strength of thousands of people, and start a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, then we can eliminate any difficulties on the road ahead, complete and over fulfill the national economic development plan ahead of schedule, and make the cause of socialist construction develop forward at a high speed.

    高度重视人民群众的伟大作用
    福建日报10月17日社论
    翻读近来的报纸，展现在我们眼前的是一幅红霞满天、金光灿烂的跃进图景，从全国到福建，大战8、9月战果赫赫，初战四季度成就辉煌，我们的社会主义建设事业正在继续飞快的向前跃进：这儿农业取得大丰收，增产几成甚至上倍；那儿工业生产建设比去年同期成倍地增长，五年计划、今年计划、月计划纷纷提前完成。这些令人鼓舞的伟大成就从何而来呢？是因为党的八届八中全会带来了巨大的热力，横扫一小撮右倾机会主义者所掀起的一小股冷风；是因为广大人民群众在党的总路线的红旗引导和八中全会的号召下，鼓足干劲，发挥了无穷智慧和无限力量。在这一方面，辉煌巨大的成就为我们总结了一条建设社会主义的根本性经验，那就是，在社会主义建设中要充分估计人民群众的智慧和力量，充分发挥人民群众的干劲，既见物更要见人。经过去年大跃进和今年继续大跃进，这条重要的经验已为更多的人所认识并且运用起来，成为我们多快好省地建设社会主义的重要武器。右倾机会主义者不信任群众、害怕群众、污蔑群众的种种论调，已为广大群众所表现出来的巨大力量所粉碎。但是，即使在今天，有没有这样一些人，他们仍然低估了人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，只见物不见人，或者见物多，见人少呢？有的，例如有的地方在制订计划或接受任务时，只算“物”的账，却不算人的无可限量的账，说缺这样，又少那样；怪这条件不好，那条件又不利。因为他们看不到人民群众的干劲和智慧，看不到人的主观能动性，结果摆在他们面前的就只是一大堆“物”的困难，对克服困难继续大跃进缺乏信心。不继续克服这种右倾思想，就不能充分发挥广大人民群众的积极性，以多快好省地完成大跃进的计划，就不能高速度地进行社会主义建设。
    人民群众是历史的创造者，是历史的主人。充分承认人民群众的伟大作用，满腔热情地对待革命的群众运动，高度地发扬人民群众的创造力和主动性，这是我们无产阶级政党、无产阶级革命家同资产阶级政党、资产阶级革命家最主要的、根本性的区别。我们革命和建设的胜利，正是在党领导下，通过发动群众、依靠群众而取得的。我们的党和毛主席高度地重视人民群众的作用。“六亿神州尽舜尧”，是我们领袖对伟大人民群众的估价。毛主席在介绍河南应举农业合作社时曾写道：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”刘少奇同志在八大二次会议的报告中也说：“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。忽视这个伟大的动力，就会同马克思列宁主义背道而驰。”党集中了广大人民群众意志而制定的社会主义建设总路线，为我国人民建设社会主义积极性创造性的发挥，开辟了无限广阔的道路。总路线的本质，就是对人民群众的在建设社会主义事业中的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的高度重视。“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，就是要充分发挥六亿五千万人民的伟大主观能动作用。
    大跃进以来的震动中外的无数事实，更雄辩地说明了人民群众的伟大作用。不是吗？我们工农业大跃进，不是主要靠人民群众的干劲吗？以农业来说，大家知道，我们农业方面的技术物质条件是很差的，随着工业的发展，农业机械和化学肥料虽有增加，但是还非常有限。可是我们农业发展速度远远超过主要资本主义国家。帝国主义阵营的头子美国，农业机械和化学肥料比我国多出不知多少倍，可是从1949年到1958年，美国粮食产量只增长了25％，平均每年仅增长2.5％，而我们大跃进的1958年一年就增长了35％，超过美国十年的总和。说近的吧！仙游县今年的早稻，平均每亩只有十斤化肥，没有一架拖拉机，可是他们大丰收了，单位产量不是增加2％或3％，而是22％强。像仙游这样的增长速度，在全省来说并不是个别的；而许多有严重困难的地方，“物”的条件极差，生产同样增长很快。大家可看看丘陵起伏、土地贫瘠、风灾旱灾频繁的平潭县，自然条件那样恶劣，可是他们早稻单位产量增加了57％，由于改造了自然条件，扩大了水稻面积，总产量增加了四倍。他们的大丰收靠什么？靠党的领导，靠人民公社，靠群众的干劲；没有水，修水利；没有机械施工，就靠人力；劳力不足，就想办法改革工具；没有化肥，男女老少就积农家肥、造土化肥……。我们有着优越的社会制度，从合作社发展到人民公社这一新的生产关系的变革使生产力获得空前的大解放，使人的作用得到充分发挥。而美国腐朽的社会制度，阻碍着生产力的发展，劳动人民在那里受剥削受压迫，即使有很好的“物”的条件，也决然达不到我们今天的发展速度。作用都大大被束缚住了。农业情况如此，工业情况也如此。举个小小的例子。福州有个机床厂，去年，他们所用的大部分车床是1866年左宗棠办的马尾造船厂遗留下来的老爷车床，有的还烙有“同治”的年号，在“见物不见人”的人看来，这条件太坏了，这些设备早该报废了。可是，有干劲的工人能改造这不利条件，改装了老爷车床，并且用这些车床生产了大批精密度相当高的机床、水轮机、造纸机等等机器。党的八届八中全会以前，我们的经济形势虽然也是良好的，每个月工业总产值都比去年同期有很大增长，但是由于一小部分干部的右倾思想作怪，曾一度影响了群众的干劲，有的产品6、7月份的产量甚至比上几月还下降了。党的八中全会号召“反右倾、鼓干劲”，人们的干劲马上鼓足了，客观物质条件几乎没有改变，但一股巨大的生产力随着鼓足干劲从地平线上冒了出来，生产直线上升，许多过去认为不能解决的困难迅速得到解决，全省工业总产值8月份比7月份增长16.8％，9月份又比8月份猛增56.8％。如木材生产，过去几个月完成计划情况一直不大好，8月份一开始反右倾、鼓干劲，生产立即上升，8月份比7月份增长34％，9月份更比8月份猛增一倍多，提前三个多月完成了年计划。这不是又给了有右倾思想的人一贴良药吗？
    干劲，也就是人的主观能动性。人与物的关系，也是主观能动性与客观规律的关系，是主观与客观的关系，它们之间是对立的又是统一的。我们承认客观条件，但我们又认为人是可以认识、掌握和改变客观条件的。当具备了一定客观条件的时候，人的主观能动作用也就是人的干劲就成了决定因素，“事在人为”，“人定胜天”。社会斗争如此，向自然界作斗争也如此。生产用的工具机器等物质条件是人创造的，技术是人掌握的，因此，首先必须看到人的作用。现实生活就是这样：条件相同，干劲不同，结果就不同；甚至设备技术好的厂，因干劲不足，生产出来的东西反而不如设备技术条件差而干劲足的工厂；土壤肥沃的良田，因主人干劲不足，产量反而低于田地瘠薄而主人干劲足的。有一些人，他们自己干劲不足，却说自己尊重客观条件，尊重物质条件，说自己从实际出发的。其实他们只看到客观条件的作用，忽视或低估了人民群众的干劲和作用；他们不是做客观条件的主人，而是做客观条件的奴隶；他们眼里的“实际”，只有“物”，而没有“人”；而且他们眼中的“物”，是静止的僵死的，不可改变的。这在哲学上是机械唯物主义和形而上学，从政治上来看则是不相信群众的表现。在这些人中间，有的已陷入右倾机会主义的泥坑，其根本原因之一也就在于他们不承认人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的主动性和积极作用，他们看不到已经从旧制度下解放出来而正在建立社会主义新制度的劳动人民的坚强意志、伟大力量和丰富智慧。我们的社会主义建设，是千千万万人民群众自己的事业，不发挥人民群众的主动性和创造力，就不会有生气勃勃的社会主义建设，就不会有真正的社会主义事业。当然，要做好经济工作，必须尊重客观经济规律，但是我们最大限度地发挥人的主观能动性，正是为了充分地利用经济规律。
    既见人，又见物，既考虑到客观条件，又充分估计到群众的伟大作用，这是唯物主义者的正确态度。作领导工作的同志在分析形势、制订计划、完成任务时，应该看到“物”的条件，但更要看到人的作用，估计到群众中蕴藏着的巨大潜力，满腔热情地对待人民群众的积极性和创造性；应该把人的条件与物的条件联系起来考虑，认识到经过人的努力，不利条件可以成为有利条件，有利条件能更为有利，但是，充分估计到群众的潜力，对于领导者来说，还只是解决了问题的第一步。领导者还应采取实际的措施，使群众干劲得到充分的发挥，从而产生最大效果。我们的大跃进是有组织的革命行动，不能指靠每个群众的自发积极性，而需要我们予以组织和教育，使群众的觉悟不断提高。因此，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞群众运动，热情地表扬先进，大插红旗，组织和开展社会主义劳动竞赛，使广大群众在总路线的引导和鼓舞下充分发挥积极性创造性。要发挥人的作用，仅仅有政治思想工作，还是不够的，还需要细致的组织工作和经济工作；例如与群众共同制订先进的计划和措施，使群众有明确的奋斗目标；合理的组织安排劳力；不断地总结推广先进经验，随时解决工作中的问题；正确贯彻社会主义按劳分配原则，关心群众的生活等等。没有这些方面科学的、具体的措施，就容易挫折群众的积极性，或者是事倍功半，或者是不能持久。
    只要我们以政治为统帅、为灵魂，把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，把对群众的政治教育和物质鼓励结合起来，我们就能把千百万群众的积极性调动起来，把千百万群众的力量组织起来，掀起轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动，那我们就能排除前进道路上的任何困难，提前和超额完成国民经济发展计划，使社会主义建设事业高速度地向前发展。
