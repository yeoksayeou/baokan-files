    Rostock New Port
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Xinmin
    Anyone who has been to Rostock is impressed by the speed of its construction. Before the war, this fishing port in the then most backward Mecklenburg region of Germany had no decent industry, and the port could only accommodate fishing boats. During the war, it suffered severe damage, with 60% of its buildings destroyed by the war. Today, apart from the seven gates and seven towers in the city that still retain their original ancient style, the entire Rostock has undergone fundamental changes. Now it is the center of the German Democratic Republic's shipbuilding, diesel engine manufacturing, and fishing combined enterprises. The ruins of war damage are hardly visible here; instead, there are newly built buildings. The urban area has expanded, and the population has increased from more than 90,000 in the early days of liberation to over 150,000. Among all the changes, the Rostock New Port, one of the major basic construction projects of the German Democratic Republic, which is being rapidly built, is particularly noteworthy.
    Before the war, there were no ocean-going ports in the Baltic Sea region of what is now the German Democratic Republic. After 1945, three ocean-going ports were opened: Wismar, Rostock, and Stralsund. Compared to the past, the throughput of these three seaports has expanded many times over. However, with the development of the national economy, especially the growth of foreign trade, these ports have long been unable to meet the needs. A large amount of materials had to be imported and exported from Hamburg in West Germany, costing more than 100 million marks in freight each year, and subject to many restrictions. The losses caused by the failure to transport materials on time were incalculable. The Party and government of the German Democratic Republic decided to expand its own ocean-going seaport, and at a plenary session of the Socialist Unity Party Central Committee in 1957, Rostock was selected as the destination for the construction of a new port.
    Rostock faces the Breitling Bay of the Baltic Sea. The existing port is on the west side of the bay, close to the city. The new port is being built on the opposite Peter village, which is closer to the sea entrance than the existing port, only five kilometers away by water, which will greatly save time for ships entering and leaving in the future. The water in Breitling Bay is shallow, and the existing port is only six meters and sixty centimeters deep, so cargo ships over 7,000 tons cannot enter. Therefore, in the construction of the new port, the excavation of a waterway that is ten and a half meters deep and sixty meters wide, and an in-bay ship dispatch yard with an area of 40,000 square meters has become its main project. In addition, the main projects of the first phase of the new port also include two cargo ship docks, an oil tanker dock, a breakwater at the sea entrance, and railway and ship repair yards connecting the mainland.
    The overall goal of the new port project is to build it into the most modern fast port on the Baltic Sea coast. The long-term plan stipulates that the annual throughput will reach 12 million tons. Specific indicators are: by the end of the first phase of the project in 1960, the commercial port will be able to berth eight 10,000-ton cargo ships at the same time, each 10,000-ton cargo ship will be required to complete loading and unloading within eight hours, and the annual throughput will reach 2.2 million tons, and the oil port will reach 1 million tons per year. By the end of the second phase of the project in 1965, the annual throughput will reach 6 to 7 million tons. In the future, it is also planned to deepen the waterway to 12 meters and build a third cargo ship dock so that the new port can receive 50,000-ton cargo ships.
    Peter village, on the east bank of Breitling Bay where the new port is located, was originally a pasture. Since the first shovel of earth was dug for the new port project on October 27, 1957, the scenery here has quickly become completely different from the original. Various machines have replaced cattle, and dredgers have become new companions for seagulls. In less than two years, the waterway has been roughly excavated, and the first dock is nearing completion, waiting for the decoration of cranes, conveyors, and other modern loading and unloading equipment. The second dock is also taking shape. The railway connecting with the mainland is under construction. The fastest progress has been made on the breakwater at the sea entrance, which was originally planned to be completed in 23 months, but was actually completed in only nine months.
    Hearing about the scale and speed of the new port construction, people always think that there must be tens of thousands of workers working here. After arriving at the new port, I realized that there are often only 2,500 to 3,000 people on the construction site. Even more unexpectedly, such a huge construction project has only 72 administrative management personnel.
    The main reason for fewer people and high efficiency is the mechanization of construction. Everywhere on the new port construction site are machines for construction, and heavy physical labor is hardly seen here. However, the mechanization of construction is not the only reason for the fast construction speed of the new port.
    In the first phase of the new port construction, the waterway, the in-bay ship dispatch yard, and several docks all require a large amount of dredging work. All dredging work relies on nine dredgers. Each dredger has twelve workers, who are divided into two shifts, working day and night. After the workers get on the ship, they live and eat on the ship. Each shift works not eight hours, but sixteen hours, and they work like this for eight days before going ashore to rest. People passing by the dredger are moved by the enthusiasm of the workers on the ship. If it were not for their day and night work, it would not have been possible for the construction speed of the new port waterway and docks to be as fast as it is now.
    The director of the new port construction site also likes to cite the example of repairing the breakwater to explain why the project is progressing so quickly here. The breakwater used a total of 900,000 cubic meters of earth and 60,000 tons of stone. Stone is particularly difficult to find in Rostock. The vicinity is a plain, and no stone can be found, so it has to be transported from other places. Under the call of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country, especially the youth, launched a voluntary labor movement to quarry stone. As a result, more than 200 train cars of stone were transported to the new port from all over the country every day. Relying on the support of the whole country, the breakwater project was completed 14 months ahead of schedule.
    The person in charge of the construction site also introduced the relationship between leadership methods and project progress. At present, the construction industry of the German Democratic Republic is promoting a method of using contract wages to speed up construction. This method was first proposed by Paul Strauss, a worker at the Rostock New Port construction site. Paul Strauss's proposal was quickly accepted by the leaders of the construction site. The person in charge of the construction site said that the implementation of contract wages not only encourages the enthusiasm of workers from the perspective of material interests, but also requires improving leadership methods and work styles, urging management personnel to step out of the office, hand over the project plan to the workers, and make the workers have a clear understanding of the plan. In this way, the implementation of the contract wage system has also become a method of realizing the slogan of "same plan, same labor, same management." Now the new port construction site is actively promoting this new system, improving leadership methods, and accelerating construction speed.
    The New Port project is a key construction project of the German Democratic Republic, led by the special zone. The special zone party committee is very concerned about the construction speed of the new port, and often studies the issue of fully tapping the potential of existing manpower and using modern technology to ensure that the new port project is completed on schedule or ahead of schedule.
    Now the red production teams and socialist labor collectives on the new port construction site are enthusiastically launching competitions. Their slogan is to build the new port into a port of peace, and their goal is to welcome the first 10,000-ton cargo ship into the new port dock by the "May Day" holiday next year. (Attached picture)

    罗斯托克新港
    本报记者　张辛民
    到过罗斯托克的人，都感到这里的建设速度真快。战前，这个在当时德国最为落后的麦格林堡地区的渔港没有像样的工业，港口也只能停些渔船。战争期间，这里遭到了严重的破坏，60％的建筑为战火所毁。今天，这里除了矗立在市内的七门七塔还保持原来的古老的风格外，整个罗斯托克却起了根本的变化。现在它是德意志民主共和国造船、造柴油发动机和捕鱼联合企业的中心。被战争破坏的遗迹在这里几乎看不到了，代替它的是一幢幢新建的楼房。市区扩大了，居民人数从解放初期的九万多人增加到十五万以上。在所有变化中，特别引人注意的还有正在迅速兴建中的德意志民主共和国主要基本建设工程之一的罗斯托克新港。
    战前，在现在德意志民主共和国沿波罗的海地区没有远洋港口，1945年以后，开辟了三个远洋港：维斯玛尔、罗斯托克和施特拉宋德。比起过去，这三个海港的吞吐量已经扩大了不知多少倍。但是随着国民经济的发展，特别是对外贸易的增长，这些港口早已不能满足需要。大量物资要从西德的汉堡进出，每年不只花费一亿以上马克的运费，而且受到许多限制，由于物资不能按时运输所造成的损失更无法计算。德意志民主共和国党和政府决心扩大自己的远洋海港，在1957年统一社会党中央的一次全会上，罗斯托克被选中为建设新港的目的地。
    罗斯托克面临波罗的海的布瑞特林湾。现有的港口在湾的西侧，靠着市区。新港建在它的对面彼得村，距离海口较现有港口还近，只有五公里水路，这样将来船只出入可以大大节省时间。布瑞特林湾水浅，像现有港口水深只六米六十公分，七千吨以上货轮就不能进口。因此，在新港建设中挖掘一条深达十米半，宽为六十米的水道和一个面积为四万平方米的湾内船只调度场就成为它的主要工程。此外，新港第一期主要工程还有两个货轮码头、一个油船码头、海口防浪堤以及连接内地的铁路、轮船修理厂等等项目。
    新港工程的总目标是建设成为波罗的海沿岸最现代化的快速港。远景计划规定每年吞吐量达到一千二百万吨。具体指标是：1960年第一期工程结束时，商港能同时停泊八艘一万吨货轮，每艘万吨货轮要求在八小时内装卸完毕，每年吞吐量达到二百二十万吨，油港每年达一百万吨。1965年第二期工程结束时，每年吞吐量达到六百到七百万吨。将来还准备加深水道到十二米，修建第三个货轮码头，使新港能接待五万吨的货轮。
    新港所在地的布瑞特林湾东岸彼得村，原来是一片牧场。自从1957年10月27日新港工程开始挖起第一铲土以来，这里的风光很快就和原来完全不同了。各种机器代替了牛群，挖泥船成了海鸥的新伴侣。不到两年，现在水道已大体挖好，第一个码头已接近完工，正等着装饰起重机、传送带等各种现代化的装卸设备。第二个码头也已具雏形。和内地连系的铁路正在加紧施工。进行得最快的是海口防浪堤，原来计划二十三个月完工，实际上只用了九个月就告成功了。
    听到新港建设的规模和速度。人们总以为一定有上万工人在这里工作。到了新港才知道工地上经常只有二千五百人到三千人。更出乎意料的是这样一个规模巨大的建设工程只有七十二个行政管理人员。
    人少而效率高，施工机械化是主要原因之一。在新港工地到处是施工用的机械，沉重的体力劳动在这里几乎是看不到了。但是，施工机械化并不是新港建设速度快的唯一原因。
    在新港建设的第一期主要工程中，水道、湾内船只调度场和几个码头都需要大量的挖泥工作。全部挖泥工作依靠九只挖泥船。每只挖泥船上是十二个工人，还要分成两班，昼夜不停地工作。工人们上船后，食宿都在船上，他们每一班工作不是八小时，而是十六小时，就这样一口气干八天才下船休息。人们经过挖泥船旁，都被船上工人的干劲所感动，如果不是他们那样夜以继日地工作，新港水道、码头的建设速度要像现在这样快，那是不可能的。
    新港工地主任还喜欢举修防浪堤的例子来解释这里的工程进展得迅速的原因。防浪堤一共用了九十万土方和六万多吨石块。石块在罗斯托克特别困难，附近是一片平原，找不到一块石头，只好从别处运来。在党和政府的号召下，全国人民特别是青年展开了一个采石的义务劳动运动。结果每天有二百多车皮的石块从全国各地运到新港。依靠了全国的支援，防浪堤的工程提前了十四个月完工。
    工地负责人还介绍了领导方法和工程进度的关系。目前，德意志民主共和国的建筑业中正在推行一种用包工工资的方法来加快建筑的速度。这个方法就是罗斯托克新港工地的工人包尔·施特劳斯首先倡议的。包尔·施特劳斯的倡议很快就被工地领导上接受了。工地负责人说，实行包工工资不只是从物质利益上鼓励工人的积极性，而首先是要求改进领导方法和工作作风，督促管理人员走出办公室，把工程计划交给工人，使工人对计划心中有数。这样，实行包工工资制也就成为实现“同计划、同劳动、同管理”的口号的一种方法。现在新港工地正在积极推行这种新制度，改进领导方法，加快建设速度。
    新港工程是德意志民主共和国重点建设项目，由专区负责领导。专区党委非常关心新港的建设速度，经常研究充分发挥现有人力的潜力和运用现代化技术的问题，保证新港工程按期或提前完成。
    现在新港工地上的红色生产队和社会主义劳动集体正在热烈地展开竞赛。他们的口号是把新港建成和平之港，他们的目标是到明年“五一”节时把第一艘万吨货轮迎进新港码头。（附图片）
