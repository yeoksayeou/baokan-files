"Three Overs and Five Comparisons" in the High-Yield and Bumper Harvest Competition

    (Our Dispatch) A mass "Three Overs and Five Comparisons" high-yield and bumper harvest campaign is vigorously unfolding in the broad countryside of Jiangsu Province. It has not only powerfully promoted the rapid development of agricultural production but also further enriched and improved the experience and methods of rural party committees at all levels in leading mass movements. The Great Leap Forward in leadership methods has driven the mass overproduction movement to a new high tide, and the face of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery is changing with each passing day.

    In carrying out the overproduction competition campaign, various parts of Jiangsu have universally used the leadership methods of on-site meetings, red flag competitions, and large-scale inspections and appraisals to promote mass movements. These leadership methods were all products of the Great Leap Forward last year. Practice has proven that these are effective methods for opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and promoting advanced experiences. According to the new situation and new characteristics of the mass movement this year, various parts of Jiangsu have further enriched and developed these leadership methods for promoting mass movements.

    On-site meetings have the characteristics of being lively, lean, economical, and highly effective. Party committees in various parts of Jiangsu have used them even more universally this year in the overproduction campaign. Last year, on-site meetings were generally held in advanced areas or units. In addition to continuing to use this form this year, creative developments have also emerged. There are two main types: mobile on-site meetings and comparative on-site meetings.

    Mobile On-site Meetings and
    Comparative On-site Meetings

    Mobile on-site meetings have a wider scope of activity. Generally, the prefectural or county party committee organizes leading cadres at the county, commune, or brigade level and above to adopt a form of activity that combines cursory observation and in-depth focus. During the visit, when advanced experiences are discovered, meetings are immediately held on the spot, red flags are planted, pacesetters are established, discussions are organized, and the experiences are promoted. For example, the mobile on-site meeting held by the Haimen County Party Committee in early August involved the county party secretary, standing committee members, and first secretaries of commune party committees walking through the entire county to inspect current production and widely contact grassroots cadres and the masses. When good experiences and methods in production and party committee leadership methods were discovered, meetings were held on the spot to organize promotion. This mobile on-site meeting greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the people throughout the county and powerfully promoted the field management of autumn-ripening crops.

    Comparative on-site meetings are a new type of on-site meeting that has emerged since the anti-rightist campaign. On the basis of in-depth large-scale inspections, two typical units (communes, brigades, or teams) with basically the same conditions but very different production levels are selected. The county party committee organizes all commune party committees or responsible cadres above the brigade level to hold on-site meetings, establish opposing sides, mobilize everyone to discuss, introduce the experience of advanced units, and create an atmosphere of advanced glory and great effort to strive for advancement. For backward units, on-site assistance and on-site consultations are carried out to promote the rapid catching up of backward units. The comparative on-site meeting held by the Xinghua County Party Committee in early September in the Zhouhuang and Qianhu production brigades of the Tangliu Commune, with the participation of commune party committee secretaries, had very good results. The Zhouhuang and Qianhu brigades are next to each other, and the fields are next to each other. In terms of conditions, Qianhu is slightly better than Zhouhuang, but in terms of production, Qianhu is far behind Zhouhuang. The main reason is that, from the branch secretary to the commune members, the Zhouhuang Brigade has a very strong sense of striving for advancement. They specifically look for advanced teams that are stronger than themselves as competition opponents, and various production measures are implemented in a timely, solid, and meticulous manner. The cadres of the Qianhu Brigade are satisfied with being better than backward teams, and ideologically they are content to be in the middle. They lack enthusiasm and, in the competition, they specifically compete with teams that have worse conditions than themselves. Through the comparative on-site meeting, advanced pacesetters were established, and a red flag competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced was launched. At the same time, the comrades present recognized the harm of right-leaning thinking from the example of Qianhu. After the on-site meeting, a new production upsurge quickly swept through the county.

    Red flag competition is an important leadership method for organizing mass movements and driving them to a climax. In the broad countryside of Jiangsu, competitions are now being held everywhere, and everywhere is bustling with activity. The content of the competition is adapted to local conditions and current needs. In larger areas, such as communes and counties, some are competing in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, while others are competing in single crops. In smaller areas, such as brigades and teams, the competition is generally based on current agricultural tasks (such as fertilizer accumulation, pest control, and harvesting). The "Three Overs and Five Comparisons" high-yield and bumper harvest competition recently launched in the province's rural areas is the most comprehensive in content, the widest in scope, and the largest in scale.

    Counterpart Competition, Joint Competition, and
    Labor Over-Quota Competition

    In the province-wide overproduction competition campaign, not only are the competition targets higher than last year, the measures are more solid than last year, and the enthusiasm is greater than last year, but also various new forms of competition have emerged. One form is the counterpart red flag competition. This means that a county, a commune, or a brigade chooses a county, commune, or team with conditions similar to its own or with better production than its own to carry out competition. The content of the competition is generally single crops. For example, in the overproduction campaign, Dongtai County challenged Siyang County, the provincial cotton champion county last year, to compete with Siyang for the provincial cotton champion this year. After the start of the competition, cadres are often organized to visit each other, exchange experiences, catch up with each other, and promote each other. Another form is joint competition. This means that several counties or several communes launch a competition to the province, the special zone, or the county. For example, in early September, seven counties including Changshu, Lishui, Haimen, and Lianshui issued a proposal to all counties in the province for a three-over (actual output exceeding contracted output, every item exceeding targets, everyone exceeding quotas) and five-comparison (comparing field management, comparing autumn harvest, comparing autumn planting, comparing procurement, comparing distribution) high-yield and bumper harvest competition, which kicked off the province's magnificent and imposing overproduction competition campaign. Recently, the Nantong Special Zone has further developed this form of joint competition. In order to better organize the current autumn planting work, the Nantong Special Zone initiated a multi-item joint competition movement for autumn planting, with the overall goal of striving for a comprehensive high yield of summer-ripening crops next year, led by fifteen relatively advanced people's communes. In addition to striving for a high yield of all summer-ripening crops, the competition content also includes eleven items such as eliminating three types of seedlings, the turnaround of poor teams, boundary cooperation, and caring for the lives of the masses. In addition to participating in the comprehensive high-yield competition, the units participating in the competition can also choose a single item and find opponents to compete with, according to their own conditions and characteristics. The characteristics of this competition are: it has both a common goal and specific requirements that meet the actual conditions of each commune and team; it has both pacesetters for comprehensive leap forward and banners for single-item high yield; it competes in both autumn planting production and leadership methods; it is both comprehensive promotion and classified promotion. In this way, under the general goal, the positive factors of all aspects can be mobilized, the strengths of each commune and team can be brought into play, and cadres and the masses in all types of regions can be mobilized and organized into a vigorous autumn planting competition. The trend will inevitably be a new situation of red flags everywhere and pacesetters for every item, thereby ensuring the complete victory of summer-ripening production next year.

    Another form is the labor over-quota competition carried out among the broad masses of commune members. The forms of competition are even more diverse. For example, in Taixing County, it is setting up a challenge platform and challenging; in Changshu County, it is the champion stage and the hero list; in Jintan County, it is defending the red flag and seizing the red flag; in Jingjiang County, it is on-site high-efficiency competition; and some are evaluating five-good commune members or advanced pacesetters, etc. Commune members put forward more specific and practical competition conditions according to the production team's short-term agricultural work plan requirements, and find competition opponents in the same type of work (such as fertilizer accumulation, pig raising, and canteens). Labor over-quota competition is an important leadership method for mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of commune members and is also a very important part of the entire overproduction competition campaign. This competition directly and powerfully promoted the development of the overproduction competition campaign. Segmented Inspection and Segmented Evaluation

    Large-scale inspections and evaluations, this leadership method continued to play an active role in this year's overproduction competition campaign. The method of segmented inspection and segmented evaluation recently proposed by the Nantong Special Zone has further developed this leadership method. According to the characteristics of the entire growth period of summer-ripening crops, the people's communes in Nantong Special Zone divide the competition into four segments and carry out inspections and evaluations: The first segment starts now, mainly to check whether the autumn planting area implements the national plan, whether the "three guarantees" are implemented, whether the arrangement of base fertilizer, seeds, tools, and stubble meets the requirements, and whether the technical operating procedures are reasonable. The second segment carries out the "six-good" evaluation of autumn planting: comparing good seed treatment and even emergence; comparing fast and high-quality deep plowing; comparing sufficient and high-quality base fertilizer; comparing reasonable stubble matching and good specifications and quality; comparing the use of more improved agricultural tools and high work efficiency; comparing the reasonable organization of labor and good equal-value exchange cooperation. The third and fourth segments also initially set out inspection and evaluation requirements according to the key periods of main growth of summer-ripening crops. This method of segmented inspection and segmented evaluation can promptly discover advanced experiences in the movement, promptly summarize and promote them, promote the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to catch up, thereby ensuring that the high tide of summer-ripening production develops wave after wave.

    拿起好武器  夺取新胜利
    江苏各级党委发展大跃进中领导群众运动的经验
    “三超五比”的丰产丰收竞赛
    本报讯　江苏省广大农村正在蓬勃开展着的群众性的“三超五比”丰产丰收运动，不仅有力地推动了农业生产飞速发展，而且进一步丰富和提高了农村各级党委领导群众运动的经验和方法。领导方法的大跃进，更把群众性的超产运动引向新的高潮，农、林、牧、副、渔五业的面貌日新月异。
    江苏各地在开展超产竞赛运动中，普遍运用了现场会议、红旗竞赛和开展大检查、大评比等大搞群众运动的领导方法。这些领导方法都是去年大跃进的产物。实践已经证明这是当前反右倾、鼓干劲，发扬先进的有效方法。江苏各地根据今年群众运动的新形势、新特点，又进一步丰富和发展了这些大搞群众运动的领导方法。
    现场会议具有活泼、精干、经济和效果大等特点，江苏各地党委在今年超产运动中运用得更加普遍。去年各地召开的现场会议，一般都是在先进地区或先进单位开的，今年除了继续运用这种形式以外，又有了创造性的发展。主要有两种，一是流动现场会议，一是对比现场会议。
    流动现场会议和
    对比现场会议
    流动现场会议活动范围较广，一般是由地委或县委组织县、公社或大队一级以上党委负责干部，采取走马看花和深入重点下马看花相结合的活动形式，在参观中发现先进立即就地召开会议，插上红旗，树立标兵，组织议论，加以推广。例如，海门县委8月初召开的流动现场会议，就是由县委书记、常委和公社党委第一书记走遍全县各地，检查了当前生产，广泛地接触了基层干部和群众，发现生产上、党委领导方法上的好经验、好方法，就地开会，组织推广。这次流动现场会议，大大鼓舞了全县人民的生产积极性，有力地推动了秋熟作物的田间管理。
    对比现场会议，这是反右倾以来出现的一种新型的现场会议形式。在深入进行大检查的基础上，选择条件基本相同而生产却相差较大的两个典型单位（公社、大队或小队），组织全县各公社党委或者大队以上负责干部开现场会，树立对立面，发动大家议论，介绍先进单位的经验，造成先进光荣和大鼓干劲、力争上游的气氛。对落后单位，进行现场帮助、现场会诊，促进落后单位猛赶先进。兴化县委9月上旬在唐刘公社的周黄、千户两个生产大队召开的有各公社党委书记参加的对比现场会议，效果很好。周黄、千户两个大队庄靠庄、田靠田，论条件，千户比周黄稍好一点，比生产，千户却比周黄差的远。主要原因是：周黄大队从支部书记到社员，力争上游的思想很强烈，专找比自己强的先进队做竞赛对手，各项生产措施贯彻得及时、踏实、细致。千户大队的干部满足于自己比落后队好，思想上甘居中游，干劲不足，在竞赛中，专门和条件比自己差的队比。通过对比现场会议，树立了先进标兵，掀起了学先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛；同时，到会同志从千户的事例中认清了右倾思想的危害。现场会议以后，全县迅速掀起了一个新的生产高潮。
    红旗竞赛是组织群众运动并把运动推向高潮的一个重要的领导方法。在江苏广大农村中，现在是处处都在搞竞赛，处处是热气腾腾。竞赛内容因时制宜，因地制宜，范围大一点的，如公社与公社、县与县，有的是农、林、牧、副、渔项项都赛，有的是单项作物竞赛；范围小一点的，如大队与大队，小队与小队，一般都是以当前农活（如积肥、治虫、收割等）为内容开展竞赛。最近全省农村开展的“三超五比”丰产丰收竞赛，则是内容最全面，范围最广，声势最大的竞赛。
    对口竞赛、联名竞赛和
    劳动超定额竞赛
    在全省性的超产竞赛运动中，不仅竞赛指标比去年更高，措施比去年更扎实，干劲比去年更大，而且也出现了各种各样的新的竞赛形式。一种形式是对口红旗竞赛。就是一个县、一个公社或者一个大队，选择条件与自己差不多或者生产上比自己好的县、社、队开展竞赛。竞赛内容一般都是单项作物。如东台县在超产运动中向去年全省棉花冠军县泗阳县挑战，与泗阳争夺今年全省棉花冠军，竞赛开始后，经常组织干部互相参观，交流经验，你追我赶，互相促进。另一种形式是联名竞赛。就是几个县、几个社向全省、全专区、全县发起竞赛。如9月上旬常熟、溧水、海门、涟水等七个县向全省各县发出三超（实产超包产、项项超指标、人人超定额）五比（比田间管理、比秋收、比秋种、比征购、比分配）丰产丰收竞赛倡议，就揭开了全省规模壮阔、气势磅礴的超产竞赛运动的序幕。最近，南通专区更把这种联名竞赛的形式发展了一步。为了把当前秋种工作组织得更好，南通专区由十五个比较先进的人民公社，以争取明年夏熟作物全面高产为总目标，发起秋播多项联名竞赛运动。竞赛内容除了争取夏熟作物项项高产外，还有消灭三类苗、穷队翻身、边界协作、关心群众生活等十一个项目。参加竞赛的单位，除了必须参加全面高产的竞赛外，还可以各按自己的条件和特点，选择单项，自找对手，挂钩竞赛。这种竞赛的特点是：既有共同的奋斗目标，又有切合各社队实际情况的具体要求；既有全面跃进的标兵，又有单项高产的旗帜；既赛秋种生产，又赛领导方法；既是全面促进，又是分类促进。这样，就可以在总的奋斗目标之下，调动各方面的积极因素，发挥每一个社、队的长处，把各类地区的干部和群众都动员组织到轰轰烈烈的秋播竞赛中来，其趋势，必将出现处处插红旗、项项树标兵的新局面，从而保证明年夏熟生产的全胜。
    还有一种形式是在广大社员中开展的劳动超定额竞赛。竞赛形式更是多种多样的。例如，在泰兴县是摆擂打擂，在常熟县是状元台和英雄榜，在金坛县是保红旗夺红旗，在靖江县是现场高工效比武；还有一些是评五好社员或者是先进标兵等等。社员们根据生产队小段农活计划要求，提出更具体、更切实的竞赛条件，在同一工种（如积肥、养猪、食堂等）内找竞赛对手。劳动超定额竞赛，是调动社员劳动积极性的重要领导方法，也是整个超产竞赛运动的一个十分重要的组成部分。这一竞赛直接地有力地推动了超产竞赛运动的发展。分段检查、分段评比
    大检查大评比，这种领导方法在今年超产竞赛运动中继续发挥了积极作用。最近南通专区提出的分段检查、分段评比的方法，又进一步发展了这种领导方法。南通专区各人民公社根据夏熟作物整个生长时期的特点，分为四段进行竞赛和开展检查评比：第一段，目前就开始，主要是检查秋播面积是否执行国家计划，“三包”是否落实，基肥、种子、工具、茬口安排是否合乎要求，技术操作规程是否合理。第二段，开展秋播“六好”评比：比种子处理好，出苗齐；比深翻速度快，质量高；比基肥足、质量好；比茬口搭配合理，规格质量好；比改良农具用得多，工效高；比合理组织劳力，等价交换协作好。第三、第四两段也根据夏熟作物主要生长的关键时期初步订出检查评比要求。这种分段检查、分段评比的方法，能及时发现运动中的先进经验，及时加以总结推广，促进先进的更先进，落后的迎头赶上，从而保证夏熟生产高潮一浪高一浪的向前发展。
