Ten Years of Progress on the Road of Self-Remolding
Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

Ten years of experience have proven that, due to the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, national industrialists and businessmen are advancing on the road of accepting socialist transformation in a tortuous and repetitive manner.

Ten years have passed since the founding of the nation! Each of us is filled with boundless enthusiasm, cheering for the victory of the motherland, and sincerely grateful for the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Everyone sees that, after only ten short years, our country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely embarked on the socialist road and has achieved extremely brilliant and astonishing achievements in all aspects. The historical experience of the past ten years tells us that only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we forever get rid of the weak, poor, miserable, and painful past; only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we have the vibrant and vigorous present; and only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao will we have a bright, beautiful, and infinitely wonderful future.

Our Chinese national industrialists and businessmen have been shouting the slogan "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road" for several years. This resounding slogan has been inspiring and guiding us to continuously advance on the road of accepting socialist transformation in every period. However, the facts have also proven that, due to the dual nature of our Chinese national bourgeoisie, we are advancing in a tortuous and repetitive manner. The teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao have always been the beacon illuminating our path forward. If we leave the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will be thrown out of the train of the times and walk into the decadent and decaying capitalist dead end; but by following the Party and Chairman Mao, we can continue to advance and join the people of the whole country in moving towards socialism and communism.

Let us briefly recall the experiences of the past ten years!

On the eve of national liberation, our righteous national industrialists and businessmen were in dire straits. Prices soared, currency values plummeted, foreign goods flooded the market, and there were countless oppressions and harassments. It was truly a state of being unable to operate, at the end of our rope, and barely surviving. If the Party had not saved us and overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, countless people would have gone bankrupt and unemployed, falling into the abyss of suffering. After the national liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the People's Government was established, and the Common Program was formulated. The policy of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital was adopted for private industry and commerce. The currency value and prices were quickly stabilized, enabling industries and businesses beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to recover and develop. At the same time, the Party educated us on the Common Program, which enabled us to begin to accept the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. However, at that time, due to the fact that liberation was not long ago, the bourgeoisie had a strong desire to develop capitalism and was not convinced by the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. The bourgeoisie's profit-seeking nature and the corrupt management style of capitalism brought negative and destructive effects to the development of the national economy, to the point of launching a frenzied attack on the working class. If the Party had not promptly unified finance and economics in 1950, stabilized prices, strengthened market management, and then carried out the great Five-Anti Campaign from 1951 to 1952, countless people would have fallen further into the mire of sin and become criminals of the people.

The Five-Anti Campaign gave us an extremely profound education, making us begin to realize the corrupt nature of capitalism, the strength of socialist forces, and the necessity of accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy, the supervision of the working masses, and the management of the People's Government. This enabled us to take a step forward in accepting socialist transformation. In 1953, the promulgation of the general line for the transition period of the state led and organized us to carry out extensive and in-depth study. Subsequently, the state formulated the constitution for the transition period, which further encouraged and educated us. At this time, under the state's policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, private industry and commerce were gradually incorporated into various forms of state capitalism. On the one hand, we industrialists and businessmen felt excited and encouraged to see the rapid recovery of the national economy. On the other hand, we were educated by the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, and many people embarked on the road of joint state-private ownership. However, in the process of advancing, various thoughts and behaviors that lingered on capitalism and sought to get rid of the leadership of the state-owned economy were stubbornly displayed, and the slogan of "Long live New Democracy," which actually hoped that the new democratic society would stagnate, was shouted out. It was not until 1955, when the socialist transformation of the countryside—the high tide of the cooperative movement—was launched, and Chairman Mao convened a forum of the Central Committee members and executive committee members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and representatives of the industrial and commercial circles on the eve of the Second Plenary Session of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and gave instructions that the industrial and commercial circles should recognize the laws of social development and master their own destiny, that a high tide of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry was launched in the industrial and commercial circles.

Joint state-private ownership of the entire industry gave us industrialists and businessmen another extremely profound socialist education. This enabled us to take a big step forward on the road of accepting socialist transformation. Through joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, the industrial and commercial circles handed over the ownership of the means of production to the state, and the Party and the state paid us fixed interest on a regular basis. Furthermore, good work arrangements and care were made for us, enabling us to participate in enterprises and other work positions as state-appointed staff members. We were also continuously subjected to socialist ideological education to help us continue to carry out self-education and self-remolding. Many people in our industrial and commercial circles personally felt the Party and the state's meticulous care, training, education, and care for the industrial and commercial circles, and further realized the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation. At the same time, they saw the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan, and their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction and accepting socialist transformation was improved to varying degrees. Some people actively participated in socialist competitions and made certain contributions. However, at this time, there were also many people who still lingered on the private ownership of the means of production and the status and unreasonable lifestyle of the past exploiting classes, believing that there was no motivation for work after the enterprise was handed over, and lamented "formerly the monarch of a small country, now a subject of a great country." They adopted a passive and sluggish attitude in their work and took an irresponsible attitude. What was particularly serious was that it was quite generally believed that after handing over the means of production, the bourgeoisie no longer had a dual nature, and there was no need to continue to carry out the fundamental transformation of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism. Due to the growth of the negative side in political ideology, a small number of bourgeois right-wingers took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to stir up trouble and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. At this time, the Party once again shouted loudly to us, led the people of the whole country, and launched a vigorous anti-rightist struggle to thoroughly smash the rightists' attack. It also led us in the industrial and commercial circles' rectification movement, with heart-to-heart talks as the main content, during the national rectification movement, so that we gradually woke up and realized that the Communist Party could not be opposed, the capitalist road could not be taken, and rightists could not be, and realized that the capitalist stance was reactionary, our own dual nature still existed, and the issue of political stance had not been resolved, and it was still necessary to carry out the fundamental transformation of political ideology.

The great anti-rightist rectification movement was a socialist education movement that was even more profound than the Five-Anti Campaign. It enabled us industrialists and businessmen to make progress to varying degrees in political ideology. It made us further realize that the only way out was to better combine our personal future with the socialist future of the country. After the rectification movement, most of us industrialists and businessmen returned to the enterprises, and the recognition of accepting the leadership of the Party and the working class was improved to a certain extent. We were closer to the Party than in the past. Our work enthusiasm also improved to a certain extent. Most people went to the counters and workshops to participate in regular and irregular labor training, and thus took another step forward on the road of self-remolding. At this time, the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was announced, and a Second Five-Year Plan that was even greater than the First Five-Year Plan was put forward, making our country's socialist construction cause reach an unprecedented scale and speed with the force of a thunderbolt. Most of us industrialists and businessmen worked in state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and other socialist work positions. Countless facts witnessed with our own eyes demonstrated the rapid progress of the motherland, and we could not but be greatly encouraged. Driven by the great situation and led by the broad masses of working people, most of us joined the movement to increase production and practice economy, and also participated in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward to varying degrees, and some people even made certain contributions. At the same time, the Party reaffirmed the "five no-change" policy, further clarified the policy of actively helping industrialists and businessmen to carry out self-education and self-remolding in their work of participating in national construction, and continued to implement the gentle breeze and fine rain, that is, the policy of persuasion and education, in the transformation of political ideology, and encouraged us industrialists and businessmen to participate in labor within our capabilities. All of these were generally supported and welcomed in our industrial and commercial circles, guiding us industrial and commercial circles to further embark on the socialist road.

The industrialists' and businessmen's various doubts and resistances to the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization prove that the struggle between the two roads has not been completely resolved among the industrialists and businessmen.

However, this does not mean that we in the industrial and commercial circles have no problems in accepting transformation and participating in construction, nor does it mean that the issue of our political stance has been resolved. It would be inconsistent with the facts if we made such an assessment. We only need to look back again to see how many of us in the industrial and commercial circles, after the announcement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, had sufficient and clear understanding of the necessity and possibility of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the general line? Didn't many people think at that time that "the general line is too tense," "greater and faster cannot be good and economical," and "the middle reaches are the best: the upper reaches are unwilling, and the lower reaches dare not"? When the people's commune movement arrived, didn't many people greatly shock, so that we wavered, hesitated, doubted, and resisted? In the Great Leap Forward, didn't many people think that the Great Leap Forward was too hard and too tiring, and often have thoughts and emotions of fearing difficulties, slackening, giving up, and complaining? When we have made slight achievements in our work, do we not often have thoughts and emotions of complacency, pride, and self-satisfaction, thinking that the transformation is almost complete, the enthusiasm cannot be further encouraged, and preparing to "take a break"? When the market temporarily experiences some shortages in the supply of non-staple foods and daily necessities, do not many people doubt or even deny the achievements of the Great Leap Forward? In the mass steelmaking and other vigorous mass movements, aren't there also some people in our industrial and commercial circles who stand aside and point fingers, exaggerate shortcomings, and make irresponsible remarks? This precisely illustrates that we still have a negative side in our political ideology, and the issue of the two roads has not been completely resolved.

At the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, recalling the path we have traveled in the past ten years has an unparalleled and profound significance for us. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we can find the direction we need to strive for today. The Party's expectations and requirements for us industrialists and businessmen are very clear. In 1945, Chairman Mao pointed out: "We Communists never conceal our political views. Our future program, or maximum program, is to advance China to a socialist society and a communist society, which is certain and unambiguous. The name of our Party and our Marxist worldview clearly indicate this future, infinitely bright, infinitely beautiful supreme ideal." This ideal, with the victory of the people's revolution, later crystallized into the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and then crystallized into the solemn Constitution of the People's Republic of China. After the national liberation, the Party and the state adopted a policy of peaceful transformation for us industrialists and businessmen, educating and guiding us step by step to take the socialist road. We should more clearly recognize that only by wholeheartedly taking the socialist road can we have a bright future. We industrialists and businessmen have accepted socialist transformation in the past ten years, made great progress, and made certain contributions to the socialist construction cause. However, practice has proven that once we leave the Party's leadership and education in any aspect on our road forward, there will be twists and turns and repetitions. Only by listening to Chairman Mao and following the Communist Party can we smoothly transition to socialism. This is the key to the whole problem.

For industrialists and businessmen, the issue of opposing right-leaning is the issue of earnestly accepting the education of the general line and strengthening the transformation of political stance and ideology.

Now, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward to the people of the whole country the great task of opposing right-leaning, inspiring enthusiasm, realizing this year's continued leap forward, and striving to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Under this great call, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the people of the whole country have already launched a surging new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy on all fronts. Facing such a great situation and task, how should we industrialists and businessmen respond to the Party's call with practical actions and truly listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road? I believe that on the one hand, each of us industrialists and businessmen must immediately take action in every work position and join the ranks of the movement to increase production and practice economy; at the same time, on the other hand, we must also seriously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in the industrial and commercial circles, conduct in-depth ideological education on the Party's general line of socialist construction, and further mobilize the positive factors that can be mobilized.

We must clearly recognize that our country's current economic situation is a situation of continued great leap forward. Our adjusted plan indicators for this year are still indicators of continued leap forward. To complete this indicator, on the one hand, there are indeed sufficient objective conditions, and on the other hand, it still depends on our great subjective efforts. The completion of this year's plan indicators marks that we will complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, and at the same time, it will enable us to surpass the UK in terms of the output of major industrial products in about ten years ahead of schedule, and it will enable us to realize the forty articles of the agricultural program greatly ahead of schedule. We industrialists and businessmen must recognize this great significance, go all out, aim high, and, together with the people of the whole country, take on this great historical task.

In order to go all out and aim high, we must seriously study and understand the spirit and essence of the general line, and strive to overcome all ideological obstacles that are not conducive to implementing the general line and not conducive to carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. If a person has doubts and resistances to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the mass movement, it is impossible to continuously go all out and aim high in the vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy. Even if we are forced by the situation to muster enthusiasm for a time, it will not be consolidated, and it is impossible to persist to the end. Therefore, whether from the perspective of serving socialism or accepting socialist transformation, we in the industrial and commercial circles must pay special attention to the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and regard this study as an important practice for our fundamental transformation of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism. We should take the spirit of the general line as our weapon to destroy capitalism and establish socialism.

The practice of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country has proven that the Party's general line of socialist construction is completely correct, is not allowed to be doubted in the slightest, and is absolutely not allowed to be shaken. The domestic and foreign enemies have always carried out various kinds of rumors, sabotage, and slander against our general line, but their lies can never cover up the ironclad facts, can never stop the wheel of history from rolling forward, and can only further prove the greatness and correctness of the general line from the opposite side. The struggle against right-leaning opportunism has educated the people of the whole country to recognize the serious harm of right-leaning thoughts, right-leaning emotions, and right-leaning activities to the socialist cause. It has further proven that only by opposing right-leaning can we inspire enthusiasm, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and only in this way can we get rid of the backward state of poverty and blankness as soon as possible and quickly build the motherland into a strong socialist country with a high degree of culture, and only in this way can we contribute our strength to the defense of world peace. Building the motherland at a high speed is the common aspiration and firm will of the 650 million people of the whole country, and it cannot be stopped by any force. We industrialists and businessmen should recognize that right-leaning opportunism is actually a reflection of the anti-socialist thoughts of the bourgeoisie within the working class. For us industrialists and businessmen, the issue of opposing right-leaning is actually the issue of strengthening the transformation of political stance and ideology. If the various erroneous and incorrect understandings of the general line that we in the industrial and commercial circles had in the past are not overcome in time, it will be extremely detrimental to the socialist cause. Therefore, while responding to the Party's call and actively joining the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must seriously accept the education of the general line and strengthen the transformation of political stance and ideology. We must never think that because the struggle against right-leaning opportunism is only carried out within the Party and the working class, it is irrelevant to ourselves, and we can relax our self-education and self-remolding. Premier Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out in the government work report he made at the recent First Session of the Second National People's Congress that "the state will pay fixed interest to capitalists according to the original schedule, and will actively help them continue to carry out self-education and self-remolding in their work of participating in socialist construction." We must abide by this instruction and continuously strengthen transformation in active service to strive for our bright future.

When the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation came, thinking about the past and thinking about the future, I could not stop the boundless excitement in my heart. People like us who have been distressed for more than seventy years in the old society have been able to accept the leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in these ten years, and have seen our country undergo such earth-shaking changes and achieve such earth-shattering achievements under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We truly feel indescribable happiness and pride. It is only in the face of such great achievements of the motherland that we feel that our efforts are too insufficient. In the future, we must encourage each other with our comrades in the industrial and commercial circles, make progress together, and follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao forever. Under the shining of the general line, we will advance towards bright and happy socialism together with the people of the whole country.

　　在自我改造道路上前进的十年
　　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员　陈叔通
    十年来的经验证明：由于中国民族资产阶级存在着两面性，民族工商业者在接受社会主义改造的道路上，是在曲折、反复中前进的
    建国已经十周年了！我们每一个人都满怀着无限的热情，欢呼着祖国的胜利，衷心感激共产党和毛主席的英明的领导。大家都看到，经过了短短十年的时间，我们的国家在党和毛主席的领导下，毅然决然地走社会主义的道路，已经在各方面取得了极其辉煌的、令人震惊的成就。十年来的历史经验告诉我们，只有跟着共产党和毛主席，我们才能够永远摆脱那种积弱贫穷、悲惨痛苦的过去；只有跟着共产党和毛主席，我们才得到气象万千、生气勃勃的今天；也只有跟着共产党和毛主席，我们才会有花团锦簇、无限美好的前途。
    我们中国民族工商业者，几年来一直高喊着“听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路”的口号，这一响亮的口号，每一个时期都在鼓舞和引导着我们在接受社会主义改造道路上不断地前进。但是，事实也证明了，由于我们中国民族资产阶级存在着两面性，我们是在曲折、反复中前进的。党和毛主席的教导，始终是照耀着我们前进的灯塔。离开了党和毛主席的领导，我们就会被抛出时代的列车，走到没落腐朽的资本主义死胡同里去；而跟着党和毛主席，我们就能够不断地前进，就可以同全国人民一道走向社会主义和共产主义。
    让我们扼要地回想一下十年来的经历吧！
    在全国解放前夕，我们正当的民族工商业者，处在水深火热之中。物价暴涨，币值惨跌，外货充斥，苛扰重重，真是到了经营无力、山穷水尽、苟延残喘的地步。如果不是党拯救我们，推翻了国民党的反动统治，不知有多少人要破产失业，跌入痛苦的深渊。全国解放了，在党的领导下，建立了人民政府，制定了共同纲领，对私营工商业采取了发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策，又迅速地稳定了币值和物价，使有利于国计民生的工商业得到恢复和发展，同时党又对我们进行了共同纲领的教育，这就使我们开始接受了党对资本主义工商业的利用、限制、改造的政策。但是，当时由于解放不久，资产阶级存在着发展资本主义的强烈愿望，对于工人阶级和国营经济的领导是不服气的。资产阶级唯利是图的本质和资本主义腐朽的经营作风，在国民经济的发展中带来了消极、破坏的作用，以至发展到对工人阶级进行了猖狂的进攻。如果不是党及时地在1950年统一财经，稳定物价，加强市场管理，接着在1951年到1952年间进行了伟大的五反运动，不知有多少人会更进一步堕入罪恶的泥坑，成为人民的罪人。
    五反运动使我们受到了一次极为深刻的教育，使我们开始认识到资本主义的腐朽本质，认识到社会主义力量的强大，认识到接受国营经济领导、工人群众监督和人民政府管理的必要，这就使我们在接受社会主义改造方面跨进了一步。1953年国家过渡时期总路线的颁布，党又领导和组织我们进行了广泛和深入的学习。接着，国家制定了过渡时期的宪法，更使我们受到了进一步的鼓舞和教育。在这个时候，在国家统筹兼顾、全面安排的政策下，私营工商业逐步纳入了各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道。我们工商业者，一方面看到国民经济的迅速恢复，感到兴奋和鼓舞，一方面受到党的和平改造政策的教育，有不少人先后走上了公私合营的道路。但是，在前进的道路中，也相当顽强的表现出各式各样留恋资本主义、摆脱国营经济领导的思想和行为，喊出了实际上希望新民主主义社会停滞不前的所谓“新民主主义万岁”的口号。一直到1955年，农村掀起了社会主义改造——合作化运动的高潮，毛主席在全国工商联召开第一届执委会第二次会议的前夕，召集了民建和工商联中央委员和执行委员及工商界代表人士进行了座谈，作了工商界要认清社会发展规律，掌握自己命运的指示，才在工商界中掀起了全行业公私合营的高潮。
    全行业公私合营，使我们工商业者又一次受到了极为深刻的社会主义教育。使我们在接受社会主义改造的道路上又前进了一大步。通过全行业公私合营，工商界把生产资料的所有权交给了国家，党和国家对于工商业者按期付给定息。并且对我们作了很好的工作安排和照顾，使我们能够以国家任用的工作人员的身份参加企业和其他工作岗位的工作。并且不断地对我们进行了社会主义的思想教育，帮助我们继续进行自我教育和自我改造。我们工商界中有不少人切身感到了党和国家对工商界无微不至的关怀、培养、教育和照顾，进一步体会到党的和平改造政策伟大和正确，同时，看到了第一个五年计划的成就，参加社会主义建设和接受社会主义改造的积极性有了不同程度的提高，有的人积极参加了社会主义竞赛并作出了一定的贡献。但是，就在这个时候，也有很多人依旧留恋着生产资料私有制和过去剥削阶级的地位与不合理的生活作风，认为企业交出了以后工作就没有了动力，发出了“昔为小国之君，今为大国之臣”的悲叹。在工作中消极疲沓，采取了不负责任的态度。尤其严重的是，相当普遍地认为交出了生产资料，资产阶级就没有了两面性，就不需要继续进行破资本主义立社会主义的根本改造了。由于政治思想上消极一面的滋长，一小撮资产阶级右派分子利用党整风的机会兴风作浪，对党、对社会主义进行了猖狂的进攻。这时，党又及时对我们大喝了一声，领导全国人民，开展了轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，彻底粉碎了右派的进攻，又领导我们在全民整风运动中进行了以交心为主要内容的工商界整风运动，才使我们逐渐清醒过来，认识到共产党反不得、资本主义道路走不得、右派当不得，认识到资本主义立场是反动的，自己的两面性依旧存在，政治立场问题并没有解决，还需要进行政治思想的根本改造。
    伟大的反右整风运动，是比五反运动更为深刻的一次社会主义教育运动。它使我们工商业者在政治思想上得到了不同程度的进步。使我们更进一步地认识到只有把个人的前途和国家的社会主义前途更好地结合起来，才是唯一的出路。在整风运动以后，我们工商业者多数人回到了企业，在不同程度上对接受党和工人阶级的领导的认识提高了一步，对党比过去有了进一步的靠拢。工作积极性也有了一定的提高，多数人上柜台、下车间，参加了定期的和不定期的劳动锻炼，因而在自我改造的道路上又前进了一步。这时党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线公布了，又提出了比第一个五年计划更为伟大的第二个五年计划，使我国的社会主义建设事业以雷霆万钧之势，达到了史无前例的规模和速度。我们工商业者绝大多数人在国营企业、公私合营企业以及其他社会主义工作岗位上工作，无数亲眼目睹的事实，说明了祖国一日千里的进展，不能不受到极大的鼓舞。在伟大的形势推动下，在广大的劳动人民的带动下，我们多数人投入了增产节约运动，也在不同程度上参加了大跃进的行列，并且有的人还做出了一定的贡献。与此同时，党又重申了“五不变”的方针，进一步明确了积极帮助工商业者在参加国家建设工作中进行自我教育和自我改造的方针，并且在政治思想改造中继续贯彻和风细雨即说服教育的方针，并且鼓励我们工商业者参加力所能及的劳动。所有这些，在我们工商界中都得到普遍的拥护和欢迎，引导着我们工商界进一步地走上社会主义的道路。
    工商业者对大跃进、人民公社化的种种怀疑和抵触，证明两条道路的斗争，在工商业者中间并没有彻底解决
    但是，这不等于说我们工商界在接受改造和参加建设等方面就没有问题了，也不是说我们的政治立场问题已经解决了。如果我们作出这样的估计，那是不符合事实的。我们只要再回顾一下，当党的社会主义建设总路线公布以后，我们中间究竟有多少人对总路线鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的必要性和可能性有足够的、明确的认识？当时不是有许多人认为“总路线太紧张”、“多快不能好省”、“上游不甘，下游不敢，中游最好”吗？当人民公社运动到来的时候，不是有很多人大为震动，以致动摇彷徨、疑惧抵触吗？在大跃进中，不是有许多人认为大跃进太苦太累，经常产生畏难、松劲、泄气、埋怨等思想情绪吗？当我们在工作中稍有成绩的时候，不就往往会产生沾沾自喜、骄傲自满的思想情绪，认为改造已经差不多了，干劲已经不能再鼓了，准备“歇一歇”吗？在市场一时发生某些副食品和日用品供应紧张的时候，不是有许多人就怀疑甚至否定大跃进的成就吗？在大炼钢铁以及其他各项轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，我们工商界中不也有一些人站在一旁指手划脚，夸大缺点，评头品足吗？这正是说明了我们在政治思想上还存在着消极的一面，两条道路的问题并没有彻底解决。
    在建国十周年的时候，回想一下十年来走过的道路，对于我们实在有着无比深刻的意义。回溯过去，展望将来，我们就可以找出我们今天需要努力的方向。党对我们工商业者的期望和要求是十分明确的。1945年，毛主席就指出：“我们共产党人从来不隐瞒自己的政治主张。我们的将来纲领或最高纲领，是要将中国推进到社会主义社会和共产主义社会去的，这是确定的和毫无疑义的。我们的党的名称和我们的马克思主义的宇宙观，明确地指明了这个将来的、无限光明的、无限美妙的最高理想。”这个理想，随着人民革命的胜利，后来结晶为中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，继而又结晶为庄严的中华人民共和国宪法。在全国解放以后，党和国家对我们工商业者采取了和平改造的方针，一步一步地教育、引导我们走社会主义的道路，我们更应当清楚地认识，唯有一心一意走社会主义的道路，才有光明的前途。我们工商业者过去十年中接受了社会主义改造，有了很大的进步，在社会主义建设事业中，也作出了一定的贡献。但是，实践证明，在我们前进的道路上，一旦在任何方面离开了党的领导和教育，就会出现曲折和反复，只有听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，才能够平平稳稳地向社会主义过渡。这是全部问题的关键。
    对工商业者来说，反右倾的问题，就是认真接受总路线的教育，加强政治立场改造和思想改造的问题
    现在，党的八中全会向全国人民提出了反右倾、鼓干劲、实现今年的继续跃进，为提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗的伟大任务。全国人民在这一伟大的号召下，在建国十周年的时候，已经在各个战线上掀起了一个汹涌澎湃的增产节约的新高潮。面对着当前这样伟大的形势和任务，我们工商业者究竟应当怎样以实际行动，来响应党的号召，真正做到听毛主席的话、跟共产党走、走社会主义的道路呢？我认为，一方面，我们每一个工商业者，必须在每一个工作岗位上立即行动起来，投入增产节约运动的行列中去；同时，另一方面，也要在工商界中，认真学习党的八届八中全会的文件，深入进行党的社会主义建设总路线的思想教育，进一步把可以调动的积极因素充分地调动起来。
    我们必须明确认识到，我们国家当前的经济形势，是继续大跃进的形势。我们今年调整后的计划指标，依旧是继续跃进的指标。对于完成这一指标，一方面固然有充分的客观条件，另一方面还有待于我们极大的主观努力。今年计划指标的完成，标志着我们将在两年内提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，同时将使我们提前在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面超过英国，将使我们大大提前实现农业纲要四十条。我们工商业者，一定要认识到这一重大意义，鼓足干劲，力争上游，和全国人民一道，把这个伟大的历史任务担当起来。
    为了鼓足干劲，力争上游，我们必须认真学习体会总路线的精神和实质，努力克服一切不利于贯彻总路线、不利于开展增产节约运动的思想障碍。一个人如果对于总路线、大跃进、群众运动有怀疑抵触，是不可能在轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动中不断地鼓足干劲、力争上游的。即使一时迫于形势，鼓起了干劲，也是不会巩固的，是不可能坚持到底的。因此，无论从为社会主义服务或者接受社会主义改造来说，我们工商界必须特别重视对八中全会文件的学习，把这一学习当做我们破资本主义立社会主义的根本改造的一次重要实践。应当以总路线的精神，作为我们破资本主义立社会主义的武器。
    我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设实践证明了，党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的，是丝毫不容怀疑的，也是绝对不能动摇的。国内外敌人从来都对我们总路线进行着各种各样的造谣、破坏和诬蔑，但是他们的谎言永远掩盖不住铁一般的事实，永远不能阻止历史的车轮滚滚向前，而且只能从反面更加证明了总路线的伟大和正确。反对右倾机会主义的斗争，教育了全国人民认识到右倾思想、右倾情绪、右倾活动对于社会主义事业的严重危害。更加证明了只有反掉右倾，才能鼓足干劲，才能力争上游，才能多快好省地建设社会主义，才能尽快地使我们摆脱一穷二白的落后状态，迅速地把祖国建设成为一个有高度文化的、现代的社会主义强国，也只有这样，才能够在保卫世界和平中贡献我们的力量。高速度建设祖国，是全国六亿五千万人民的共同愿望和坚决意志，是任何力量也不能阻止的。我们工商业者应当认识到，右倾机会主义实际上就是资产阶级的反社会主义思想在工人阶级内部的反映。对于我们工商业者来说，反右倾问题实际上就是加强政治立场和思想改造的问题。我们工商界过去对于总路线的种种错误的、不正确的认识，如果不及时克服，对于社会主义事业是极为不利的。因此，我们在响应党的号召，积极投入增产节约运动的同时，必须认真接受总路线的教育，加强政治立场和思想的改造。决不能因为反对右倾机会主义的斗争只在党内和工人阶级内部进行，就认为与己无关，就可以放松自我教育和自我改造。周恩来总理在最近二届一次人大会议中所作的政府工作报告里清楚地指出，“对于资本家，国家将按照原定的期限付给定息，并且将积极地帮助他们在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。”我们一定要遵照这一指示，不断地在积极服务中加强改造，来争取我们光明的前途。
    当建国十周年的时候，思前想后，止不住内心的无限激动。像我们这样在旧社会苦闷了七十余年的人，能够在这十年中，接受共产党和毛主席的领导和教育，看到我们国家在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，发生这样翻天覆地的变化，得到这样惊天动地的成就，真是感到无法形容的幸福和骄傲。只是在祖国这样伟大的成就中，感到自己的努力太不够了。今后，一定要和工商界同志们互相勉励，共同进步，永远跟着共产党和毛主席，在总路线的光辉照耀下，和全国人民一道，向光明幸福的社会主义前进。
