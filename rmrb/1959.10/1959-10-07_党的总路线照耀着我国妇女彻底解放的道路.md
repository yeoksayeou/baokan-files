    The Chinese women's liberation movement, from its very beginning, has been carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and is an integral part of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. Chinese women have actively participated in all the great revolutionary movements in our country, contributing to the revolutionary cause; and every victory of the revolutionary movement has also promoted the development of the women's liberation cause. In the ten years since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the complete victory of the people's democratic revolution and the great victories of socialist transformation and socialist construction, Chinese women have fundamentally ended their history of oppression and enslavement, and have realized women's liberation and gender equality. Women play a huge and positive role in the country's political, economic, and cultural life. Women's social and family status has been raised to an unprecedented level. Under the shining light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, with the continued deepening of the socialist revolution, the development of the people's commune movement, and the overall great leap forward in socialist construction, the women's movement in our country has also leaped to a new historical stage.

    The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, point out the only correct path for our country to build socialism at high speed, and also guide the only correct path for Chinese women to achieve complete liberation. This general line concentrates and reflects the will and desire of the people of the whole country to quickly get rid of poverty and backwardness. Once the general line is grasped by the broad masses, it becomes a great and invincible force. The enthusiasm, wisdom, and strength of the broad masses have converged into a torrent, surging forward with irresistible force, creating an unprecedented new situation of a nationwide and comprehensive great leap forward and rural people's communes in our country. With the leap forward development of socialist construction, the number of female workers in the country has rapidly increased to seven million, more than ten times that of the early post-liberation period. In the mass movement to vigorously develop iron and steel and vigorously develop industry, more than ten million urban housewives have participated in local industries, handicrafts, and collective welfare undertakings. In rural areas, almost all rural women with labor ability have participated in labor. They not only account for about half of the agricultural labor force in quantity, but their labor scope has also expanded unprecedentedly. The broad masses of rural women have become a main force in agricultural production from auxiliary labor in the past.

    In the mass movement of economic construction in our country, the socialist consciousness and labor production enthusiasm of the broad masses of women have been rapidly improved. Wherever the Party points, they rush there. They have promoted the communist style in various production posts, studying assiduously, working with boundless enthusiasm, fearing no hardship, regardless of remuneration, and resolutely completing production tasks. The broad masses of women pooled their wisdom and efforts, dared to think and dared to act, vigorously engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously developed experimental fields and conducted various experiments in reforming tools. Many people have already achieved outstanding results, greatly breaking down the sense of inferiority of women caused by long-term oppression in the old society. In the socialist labor competitions carried out in all walks of life, women are an active and positive force.

    Women have not only shown a huge role in the mass movement of economic construction, but also become a huge force in defending and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. From the highest state power organs to the grassroots governments, women hold key positions. Taking the people's communes combining government and commune as an example, there are already more than 5,500 female chairpersons and vice-chairpersons.

    The high tide of the cultural and technological revolution that followed the high tide of production and construction has significantly improved the cultural and technical level of women in our country. In 1958, more than 16 million women were freed from illiteracy, and the number of women engaged in scientific and technological research also increased day by day. The ranks of women engaged in education, medical services, childcare, literature and art, and sports have expanded even faster.

    With the need for a large number of women to participate in social labor, collective living welfare undertakings have also been rapidly developed. More than 3 million childcare organizations have been developed in urban and rural areas across the country, compared with only 126 in 1947, the year with the most before liberation. By the end of 1958, public canteens in rural areas across the country had been widely developed. These collective welfare undertakings have greatly reduced the heavy housework of the broad masses of women, allowing them to devote themselves to labor and production with vigorous energy.

    The large-scale participation of women in various labors in our country has not only promoted the rapid development of socialist construction; at the same time, it has also promoted the more complete liberation of women. Lenin once said: "To completely liberate women, to make her truly equal to men, there must be a public economy, and women must participate in joint productive labor, so that women can be in an equal position with men." Due to the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, this great ideal of socialists and the broad masses of women in our country has begun to become a reality in our country today. Women in our country have become a great new force in socialist construction. The greater the contribution women make to the country and the collective in labor, the higher their status in society and at home. The more developed the country's production, the better the specific problems of women can be solved. At the same time, women can only continuously improve their socialist consciousness, improve their cultural and technical level, and learn construction skills through participating in social labor, so as to make greater contributions to socialist construction. The development of the women's movement and the personal experience of the masses of women have fully proved that the women's movement can have such a new situation today, and women can play such a huge role in production, which is precisely the great victory of the Party's general line, the great victory of the great leap forward and the people's communes, and the great victory of the Party's mass line. Some people attempt to deny the achievements of the women's movement, thereby denying the achievements of the great leap forward to oppose the general line, which is completely wrong.

    These people who criticize the great leap forward also said: "The people's communes were established too early and badly." This is also completely wrong. The establishment and consolidation of the people's communes has shown great superiority in promoting the development of rural economy and culture and improving the living standards of farmers, and has been warmly supported by the broad masses. Moreover, the people's communes provide unprecedentedly favorable conditions for accelerating the complete liberation of women, so women have more reason and with more urgent feelings to call out long live the people's communes!

    Due to the large size and public nature of the people's communes, which combine government and commune, the comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries has been accelerated. This has expanded the scope of women's labor unprecedentedly, and women can be arranged more reasonably in labor production, and the strength and wisdom of women can be brought into fuller play. At the same time, the establishment of people's communes has accelerated the realization of semi-mechanization, mechanization, and electrification of agriculture. In this way, it will gradually reduce or abolish heavy physical labor, and open up a wider road for women to engage in agricultural production. This situation has begun to be realized in our actual life. Taking the Qiliying People's Commune in Henan as an example: At present, the whole commune has 16 tractors, as well as seeders, combine harvesters, etc.; the commune also has a power station, which can supply electricity for irrigation and factories and lighting for commune members; the whole commune also has 83 factories, such as machinery factories and cotton ginning factories, to serve production and life. They have begun to live a happy life of "no need for cows to plow the fields, no need for oil to light the lamps, no need for women to grind the mills, and water flowing to high places." The scope of women's labor here is extremely wide, and the arrangement is easier and more reasonable. They not only play an important role in agricultural production, especially in cotton production, but also with the rapid development of industry within the commune, women also play an important role in mastering agricultural machinery, in commune-run industries, and in various service industries. At present, there are 450 female workers in the whole commune, accounting for 21.2% of the total number of workers in the commune; women account for 40% of the cooks working in the canteens; not only many women have become female team leaders of the commune, but also many women have become factory directors and workshop directors of factories, farm managers of breeding farms, and other leading cadres. The situation of the Qiliying People's Commune is not universal in the current rural areas across the country, but it is by no means an isolated case. From here, we not only see the incomparable superiority and broad prospects of the people's communes, but also see the great role of the people's communes in liberating women and the bright future of rural women.

    The people's commune is not only the organizer of collective production, but also the organizer of collective life. Since 1958, in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of commune production and the urgent demands of the masses (especially women), collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, sewing groups, homes for the elderly, and flour mills in rural areas have been developed on a large scale, rapidly, and universally, and have begun to gradually realize the socialization of housework. This is not only conducive to production, conducive to accelerating the development of socialist construction, conducive to life, conducive to improving the collectivist ideology of the broad masses and changing social customs, but also has a profound significance for promoting the complete liberation of women. Lenin pointed out long ago: "Only in places where the trivial housework is universally transformed into a large socialist economy can there be true women's liberation, and there can be true communism." Today we are moving in this direction. Moreover, our collective living welfare undertakings have become an indispensable part of social life under the people's commune system. In 1958, a large number of collective welfare undertakings were carried out, freeing about 55 million women from heavy housework. This huge labor force put into production will inevitably create a large amount of wealth for society, and women themselves have greatly improved their ideological awareness and broadened their horizons. Some people cannot see the great role of collective living welfare undertakings in liberating women's labor force, and cannot see the urgent demands of women for the socialization of housework. In fact, they do not understand that women's participation in social production labor will be restricted when they are burdened with heavy housework. They do not understand that after collective living welfare undertakings are carried out, women can participate in production labor without any worries. This is precisely necessary for high-speed socialist construction, and women can only obtain complete liberation through large-scale participation in social labor. They do not understand that organizing housework together will save manpower, material resources, and financial resources more than individual decentralized operations; and they do not understand that by organizing together and persisting in doing a good job actively, it is possible to carry out tool reforms and gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization, and manpower, material resources, and financial resources can be saved even more. It is baseless and completely wrong for people with right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions to deny the superiority of collective welfare undertakings.

    The establishment of the people's communes and the implementation of a wage system based on work, also implement a supply system with some embryonic characteristics of distribution according to need. In the distribution system of the people's communes, due to the component of a certain supply system, this actually becomes the most reliable social insurance. For women who have lost their ability to work and mothers with many children, this system is the most reliable guarantee for their lives. At the same time, wages are directly paid to each laborer, and women can completely get rid of their subordinate status and gain economic independence. The joy and excitement shown by women after receiving their wages for the first time fully reflects the great significance of this distribution system for improving women's economic rights and family status. The feudal patriarchal system has also been further broken, and many capable women have been respected as the heads of the family by family members. Today, in the families of commune members, there is a common scene of men and women working together, studying together, helping each other, and loving each other. The family of democracy and unity has been further consolidated and developed. This happy and beautiful family life has greatly encouraged people's enthusiasm for production and labor and their love for life.

    Domestic and foreign hostile elements maliciously slander and defame us, saying that the people's communes have destroyed families. Yes, we have destroyed the patriarchal family relationship based on the exploiting class; destroyed the small family circle tightly bound by heavy housework; destroyed the old family appearance that caused the poverty and cultural backwardness of the working people; but we have obtained an increasingly rich life and a united and harmonious family full of mutual assistance and mutual love. In the eyes of the exploiting class, the people's communes are useless; but in the eyes of the working people, they are thousands of times better. The working women are the greatest beneficiaries and feel the deepest. Any rumors and slanders by domestic and foreign hostile elements cannot shake the determination of women to follow the road of the people's communes, but will only further stimulate the infinite love and trust of women in our country for the people's communes.

    Because the ownership of the people's communes actually contains a certain degree of ownership by the whole people, this part of ownership by the whole people will be gradually expanded in the future. Therefore, the people's commune is the best form of transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and it is also the best form of transition from socialism to communism in the future. The gradual realization of this transition will enable social productive forces to develop continuously at high speed; the cultural and technical level of the country will rise day by day; the lives of men and women will become increasingly prosperous and happy; and women will gradually become knowledgeable laborers. Therefore, the road of the people's communes is the road to the complete liberation of the broad masses of rural women.

    The broad masses of women have become and will always be an important force in consolidating and developing the people's communes. Women in our country will firmly follow the road of the people's communes guided by the Party and Chairman Mao to build a new socialist countryside. Just as women in Hunan enthusiastically sing:

    The general line is the sun,
    The Party's leadership is a good idea;
    Industrial and agricultural production leap forward together,
    Running the commune is better than heaven.

    Collective welfare is done well,
    Life is arranged very carefully;
    The elderly have entered the nursing home,
    Children have entered nurseries and schools.

    Happily engage in production,
    Pigs and sheep are full of circles, and grain is full of barns,
    Versatile in both culture and martial arts plus technology,
    All kinds of capable people are strong;

    Thank the Party and Chairman Mao,
    Happy life lasts forever.

    This folk song sings the feelings and experiences of women across the country.

    Historical facts have once again proved that the victorious development and great achievements of the women's movement in our country have been obtained under the correct leadership and cordial concern of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Under the shining light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, it has promoted the cause of socialist construction, thereby creating the most basic and main premise for the development of the women's movement. The Party has always attached great importance to the strength of women and cares about the interests of the masses of women. In various movements, mobilize women and emphasize the labor protection of women. Since last year, the Party has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the complete liberation of women in the entire work of organizing production and organizing life, thus enabling the women's movement to have such a vigorous and vigorous development.

    When we excitedly look back at the glorious achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and the great development and great leap forward of the women's movement in the past ten years, especially since 1958, we are more confident in looking forward to the future. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out a bright future for us, so that we can fully imagine that in the next ten years, we will achieve greater, more, and newer achievements in socialist construction; we will victoriously achieve the great ambition of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products; our country will become increasingly prosperous and strong; and the people's lives will be more happy and beautiful. Under the shining light of the general line, what unfolds before us is an infinitely broad and splendid future. Women across the country will unite more closely around the Party, and unswervingly forge ahead along the Party's general line, the great leap forward, and the road of the people's communes. Carry out the socialist revolution to the end, and resolutely implement "politics in command." In repeated and continuous struggles, completely eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and the habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. At present, it is especially necessary to resolutely oppose various right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions that hinder our victorious advance, and resolutely crush all the slanders and defamations of domestic and foreign hostile elements. We are convinced that women of all nationalities in our country, under the leadership of the Party, in the new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement, will further give full play to their role and continuously improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, and work with the people of the whole country to create more brilliant achievements with heroic and tenacious labor, realize the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, realize the main indicators of the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule this year, and strive to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture as soon as possible.

    党的总路线照耀着我国妇女彻底解放的道路
    中华全国妇女联合会主席　蔡畅
    中国妇女解放运动，从一开始就是在中国共产党的领导下进行的，就是中国人民革命运动不可分割的一部分。中国妇女积极参加了我国历次伟大的革命运动，对革命事业作出了贡献；而革命运动的每一个胜利，也促进了妇女解放事业的发展。伟大的中华人民共和国建国十年来，在中国共产党的领导下，随着人民民主革命的彻底完成，随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大的胜利，我国妇女已经从根本上结束了被压迫被奴役的历史，实现了妇女的解放和男女平等。妇女在国家的政治、经济和文化生活中，起着巨大的积极作用。妇女的社会地位和家庭地位空前提高了。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着社会主义革命的继续深入，人民公社运动的发展，和社会主义建设的全面大跃进，我国的妇女运动也跃进到一个新的历史阶段。
    党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，和一整套两条腿走路的方针，指出了我国高速度建设社会主义的唯一正确道路，也是指引着我国妇女实现彻底解放的唯一正确道路。这条总路线集中反映了全国人民要求迅速摆脱贫穷和落后面貌的意志和愿望。总路线一旦为广大群众所掌握，就成为伟大无比的力量。广大群众的热情、智慧和力量，汇成了一股巨流，奔腾澎湃，所向无敌，开创了我国史无前例的全民全面大跃进和农村人民公社化的新局面。随着社会主义建设事业的跃进发展，全国女职工迅速增加到七百万人，比解放初期增加了十倍多。在大办钢铁、大办工业的群众运动中，使城市中千万以上的家庭妇女参加了民办工业、手工业和集体福利事业。在农村中，凡是有劳动能力的农村妇女，几乎全部参加了劳动，她们不仅在数量上占到农业劳动力的半数左右，而且她们的劳动范围空前扩大，广大农村妇女已经从过去的辅助劳动成为农业生产上的一支主力军。
    我国广大妇女在经济建设的群众运动中，社会主义觉悟和劳动生产的积极性都有了迅速提高。党指向哪里，她们就奔向哪里。她们在各种生产岗位上发扬了共产主义风格，苦钻苦学，干劲冲天，不怕艰苦，不计报酬，坚决完成生产任务。广大妇女群策群力，敢想敢干，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大办试验田和进行各种改革工具的试验，许多人已经获得了优异的成绩，大大破除了妇女由于在旧社会长期被压迫而造成的自卑思想。在各行各业开展的社会主义劳动竞赛中，妇女都是一支活跃的积极的力量。
    妇女不仅在经济建设的群众运动中，显示了巨大的作用，而且我国妇女已经成为捍卫和巩固人民民主专政的巨大力量。从国家最高政权机关直到基层政权中，都有妇女担任主要职务，仅从政社合一的人民公社来看，女正副社长就已有五千五百多人。
    随着生产建设高潮而来的文化技术革命高潮，使我国妇女的文化技术水平有了显著提高。1958年有一千六百万以上的妇女摆脱了文盲状态，妇女从事科学技术研究的数量也日益增加，从事教育、医务、保育、文艺、体育事业的妇女队伍扩大得更快。
    随着妇女大量参加社会劳动的需要，集体生活福利事业也获得了迅速的发展。全国城乡中托儿组织发展到三百多万个，解放前最多的一年——1947年只达到一百二十六个。1958年底全国农村公共食堂有了普遍的发展。这些集体福利事业使广大妇女大大减轻了繁重的家务劳动，精力充沛地投入劳动生产。
    我国妇女以极大的规模参加各种劳动，不仅促进了社会主义建设的迅速发展；同时，也促进了妇女更彻底地解放。列宁曾经说：“要彻底解放妇女，要使她与男子真正平等，就必须有公共经济，必须让妇女参加共同的生产劳动，这样妇女才会和男子处于同等的地位。”由于我国社会主义建设事业高速度的发展，社会主义者和我国广大妇女多少年来的这个伟大理想，今天在我国已经开始变为现实。我国妇女已经成为社会主义建设的一支伟大的生力军。妇女在劳动中对国家和集体的贡献越大，她们在社会和家庭中的地位也就越高。国家的生产越发展，妇女的切身的特殊问题就能得到更好的解决。同时，妇女也只有通过参加社会劳动的锻炼，才能不断提高社会主义觉悟，提高文化技术水平，学会建设本领，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。妇女运动的发展和妇女群众的切身体会已经充分证明，妇女运动能够出现今天这样崭新的局面，妇女在生产上能起这样巨大的作用，正是党的总路线的伟大胜利，正是大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利，正是党的群众路线的伟大胜利。有人企图否定妇女运动的成绩，从而否定大跃进的成绩来反对总路线，这是完全错误的。
    这些非难大跃进的人，同时也说：“人民公社办早了，办糟了。”这也是完全错误的。人民公社的建立和巩固，在促进农村经济和文化的发展方面，在提高农民生活水平方面，已经显示了巨大的优越性，得到了广大群众的热烈拥护。而且，人民公社为加速实现妇女的彻底解放，提供了空前有利的条件，因此妇女有着更充分的理由和怀着更迫切的心情高呼人民公社万岁！
    由于人民公社一大二公、政社合一的特点，加快了工农商学兵，农林牧副渔的综合发展。这就使妇女的劳动范围空前扩大，在劳动生产中可以得到更合理的安排，更充分地发挥妇女的力量和智慧。同时人民公社的建立更加速了农业的半机械化、机械化、电气化的实现。这样它就将逐渐减轻或废弃笨重的体力劳动，为妇女从事农业生产开辟更宽广的道路。这种情况，在我们的实际生活中，已经开始实现了。以河南七里营人民公社为例：目前全社已经有十六台拖拉机，以及播种机、康拜因收割机等；公社还有一座发电站，能供灌溉和工厂用电及社员照明用；全社还办有机械厂、轧花厂等为生产和生活服务的工厂八十三个。他们开始过着“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油，妇女不推磨，水往高处流”的幸福生活。这里的妇女劳动范围极其宽广，安排也更易合理。她们不仅在农业生产上，特别是在棉花生产上起着重要的作用，而且随着社内工业的迅速发展，妇女在掌握农业机械，在社办工业和各种服务行业中，也起着重要的作用。现在全社已有女工四百五十人，占公社工人总数21.2％；在食堂工作的炊事人员中，妇女占40％；不仅许多妇女担任了公社的女队长，还有不少妇女成为工厂的厂长和车间主任、饲养场长等领导干部。像七里营人民公社的这种情况，在目前全国农村虽不是普遍的，但绝不是个别的。从这里我们不仅看到了人民公社的无比优越性和远大的前途，同时也看到了人民公社对解放妇女的伟大作用和农村妇女的光明前景。
    人民公社不仅是集体生产的组织者，也是集体生活的组织者。1958年以来，为了适应公社生产迅速发展的需要和群众（尤其是妇女群众）的迫切要求。农村的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院、缝衣组、敬老院、磨面房等集体生活福利事业，有了大量、迅速、普遍的发展，开始逐步实现着家务劳动社会化。这不仅有利于生产，有利于加速社会主义建设事业的发展，有利于生活，有利于提高广大群众的集体主义思想和转变社会风气，而且对促进妇女实现彻底解放，更有着深远的意义。列宁早就指出：“只有开始把琐碎的家务，普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”今天我们正沿着这个方向前进。而且我们的集体生活福利事业，已经成为人民公社制度下社会生活中不可缺少的一部分。1958年大办集体福利事业，使五千五百万左右的妇女从繁重的家务劳动中获得了解放，这样的一支巨大的劳动队伍投入生产，必然会为社会创造大量的财富，妇女本身也大大提高了思想觉悟，开阔了眼界。有人却看不见集体生活福利事业对解放妇女劳动力的这种伟大作用，看不见妇女对家务劳动社会化的迫切要求。他们实际上不了解妇女在有着繁重家务的拖累时，参加社会生产劳动会受到限制。他们不了解举办了集体生活福利事业以后，妇女就能无牵无挂的参加生产劳动，这正是高速度建设社会主义所必需，妇女也只有通过社会规模的参加社会劳动，才能获得彻底解放。他们不了解将家务劳动组织起来进行，无论如何比个体分散进行要节约人力、物力、财力；更不了解通过组织起来，坚持积极办好，就有可能开展工具改革，逐步实现半机械化、机械化，人力、物力、财力就能得到更大节约。持有右倾思想、右倾情绪的人，否定集体福利事业的优越性是没有事实根据的，是完全错误的。
    人民公社的建立，实行按劳分配的工资制度，同时也实行部分带有按需分配的萌芽性质的供给制度。在人民公社的分配制度中，由于有一定供给制的成份，这就实际上成为一种最可靠的社会保险。对于失去劳动能力的妇女和多子女的母亲来说，这种制度，更是她们生活的最可靠的保证。同时工资直接发给每个劳动者，妇女能完全摆脱从属地位，获得了经济上的独立。从妇女们第一次领到工资后所表现的欢欣鼓舞、无比兴奋的情形，就充分反映了这种分配制度对提高妇女经济权利和家庭地位的重大意义。封建的家长制也因此进一步被破除，许多能干的妇女，被家庭成员推崇为当家人了。今天，社员的家庭中，普遍出现了男女共同劳动，共同学习，互助互爱的欢乐和谐的景象，民主团结的家庭得到了进一步的巩固和发展。这种幸福美满的家庭生活，又大大鼓励了人们生产劳动的积极性和对生活的热爱。
    国内外敌对分子恶毒地诬蔑和诽谤我们，说人民公社破坏了家庭。不错，我们破坏了建立在剥削阶级基础上的家长制的家庭关系；破坏了由繁重家务劳动紧紧束缚着妇女的家庭小圈子；破坏了造成劳动人民生活贫困和文化落后的旧的家庭面貌；我们却获得了日益富裕的生活和充满着互助互爱的团结和睦的家庭。在剥削阶级眼中，人民公社一无是处；但是劳动人民看来，却是千好万好。劳动妇女更是受益最大、感受最深的，任何国内外敌对分子的造谣诬蔑，都丝毫不能动摇妇女走人民公社道路的决心，只会更加激发我国妇女对人民公社的无限热爱和信任。
    由于人民公社的所有制中，实际上已经包含着某种程度的全民所有制的成份，今后这种全民所有制部分将逐步扩大。因此人民公社是从社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制的最好形式，也是将来从社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好形式。而这种过渡的逐步实现，将使社会生产力得到不断高速度地发展；国家的文化、技术水平日益高涨；男女人民生活日益富裕和幸福；妇女们都将逐步成为有知识的劳动者。因此，人民公社的道路，就是广大农村妇女彻底解放的道路。
    广大妇女已成为而且永远将是巩固和发展人民公社的一支重要力量。我国妇女将坚定地沿着党和毛主席指引的人民公社的道路，建设社会主义的新农村。正像湖南妇女热情歌颂的一样：
    总路线是太阳，
    党的领导好主张；
    工农生产齐跃进，
    办起公社胜天堂。
    集体福利办得好，
    生活安排很周详；
    老人进了敬老院，
    小孩入托入学堂。
    欢天喜地闹生产，
    猪羊满圈谷满仓，
    文武全才加技术，
    百般能干个个强；
    感谢党和毛主席，
    幸福生活万年长。
    这首民歌，唱出了全国妇女的心情和体会：
    历史的事实也再一次证明，我国妇女运动的胜利发展和取得伟大的成就，是在毛主席和党中央的正确领导和亲切关怀下获得的。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，推动了社会主义建设事业，从而为妇女运动的发展，创造了最基本、最主要的前提。党历来是十分重视妇女的力量，关心妇女群众利益的。在各项运动中，发动妇女并强调对妇女的劳动保护。自去年以来，党在整个组织生产、组织生活的工作中，更为妇女彻底解放创造了空前有利的条件，因而使妇女运动能有这样蓬蓬勃勃、轰轰烈烈的大发展。
    当我们兴奋地回顾十年来，尤其是1958年以来祖国的社会主义建设辉煌成就和妇女运动的大发展、大跃进的时候，我们更满怀信心地展望未来。党的八届八中全会，给我们指出了光辉的前景，使我们完全可以设想在未来的十年中，我们社会主义建设将取得更大、更多、更新的成就；我们将胜利地实现在主要的工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的壮志；我们的国家将日益繁荣富强；人民的生活将更加幸福美好。在总路线的光辉照耀下，展现在我们面前的是无限宽阔的锦绣前程。全国妇女将更加紧紧地团结在党的周围，坚定不移地沿着党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的道路奋勇前进。把社会主义革命进行到底，坚决贯彻执行“政治挂帅”。在反复地、不断地斗争中，彻底消除资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响、资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力。当前特别要坚决反对阻碍我们胜利前进的各种右倾思想和右倾情绪，坚决粉碎国内外敌对分子的一切诬蔑和诽谤。我们确信，我国各民族妇女，在党的领导下，在增产节约运动的新高潮中，一定会进一步充分地发挥作用和不断地提高自己政治、文化、技术水平，和全国人民一道，以英勇顽强的劳动，创造出更辉煌的成就，实现党的八届八中全会的号召，实现在今年内提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，为尽快地把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国而努力奋斗。
