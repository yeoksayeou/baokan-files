　　From National Support to Supporting the Nation
　　By Our Correspondents Gu Feng, Sun Ruogang, Sun Minghui, Kang Guozhi
    Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and with the vigorous support of the people across the country, the vast and rich Northeast of the motherland has been built into a powerful industrial base. On this land of over 800,000 square kilometers, the south is home to Anshan, the steel capital; Shenyang, the city of machinery; Fushun, the coal capital; and Benxi, the city of coal and iron – all within Liaoning Province. Ten industrial cities in the province, each with its own unique characteristics, form an industrial base centered on heavy industries such as steel, machinery, and coal. The northern Heilongjiang Province is a newly emerging industrial area. Newly built modern large-scale industries have made it an important base for manufacturing heavy machinery and large power station equipment in our country. The precious timber from its Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the high-quality coking coal from Jixi and Shuangyashan, are shining brightly in the nation's economic construction. The central Jilin Province, with its newly built automobile, locomotive, and rolling stock manufacturing industries, and the massive Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone, has stepped into the ranks of modern industry. Northeast industry has thoroughly swept away the traces of its pre-liberation colonial past and has become an independent system. Now, the Northeast region has both a production base for various metal raw materials and a strong coal and power industry to serve it; it has both a machinery manufacturing industry including various independent production departments and a corresponding network for parts production, tool manufacturing, and machinery repair; it has both a series of production departments and a developed transportation industry to serve them; it has both a strong heavy industry sector and a relatively developed light industry. The Northeast industrial base, built with the full support of the people across the country, is now using its powerful production capacity to support the socialist construction of the entire nation.
    Currently, these modern industrial sectors are using the advanced technical equipment they produce day and night, and the thousands upon thousands of technical talents they have diligently cultivated, to arm the new industrial bases being built across our country.
    At the marshalling yards of Sujiatun Station and Jinzhou Station, the largest railway transportation hubs in the Northeast, you can see the endless stream of trains, fully loaded with various types of steel, heavy and precision machine tools, huge power generation equipment, brand-new automobiles, efficient locomotives, golden timber, shiny black coal, and batches of construction workers, heading to Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, and many construction bases across the country. Only then will you deeply feel how magnificent is the power displayed by this industrial base, nurtured by the blood and sweat of the people across the country, in socialist construction. People remember that not long after the liberation of the entire Northeast, when people were diligently healing the wounds of destruction, the wise Party issued a great call to the people of the country: we must build the Northeast into a major base for national industrialization. From that time on, batches of cadres and hundreds of thousands of workers came here from all fronts across the country, and began an unprecedented and magnificent industrial construction. Ten years have passed, and today the Northeast region is duty-bound to contribute to and repay the economic construction of the whole country. "Fully tap potential, vigorously support the nation, and gradually develop rationally" has long been the guiding principle for all work of Party committees at all levels in the Northeast for several years; "Everything for the nation" has become the action slogan of the vast number of workers and staff in the Northeast.
    It is still impossible to make accurate statistics on how many industrial products this powerful industrial base in the Northeast has supported the nation in recent years, and how many construction talents have been sent to the nation; all industrial enterprises on this base, whether modern large-scale industries or small and medium-sized local industries, are striving to support the nation and have devoted all their strength. There are endless examples of their prioritizing the nation over the locality and guaranteeing key projects with all their might. As early as December last year, when Baotou Steel's coke ovens were being heated, it was impossible to buy thermocouples anywhere, without which the ovens could not be heated. In the end, Anshan Iron and Steel provided forty thermocouples. No wonder the people building Baotou Steel often affectionately called Anshan Iron and Steel their "mother's home." Whenever they talked about Anshan Iron and Steel's enthusiastic support for Baotou Steel, they said: "Baotou Steel lacks something, and the 'mother's home' will give it to them." Recently, Anshan Iron and Steel specially rolled out a batch of alloy pipes for its own use to replace the cracking pipes in the coking plant. At this time, Baotou Steel also came to request support for this alloy pipe. On the one hand, they urgently needed to replace the cracking pipes themselves, and on the other hand, Baotou Steel urgently needed this steel pipe for construction. It seemed difficult to weigh which was more urgent, but the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel decided without hesitation to send this batch of alloy pipes to Baotou Steel. Now, there are more and more steel products supported by Anshan Iron and Steel everywhere in the country. In 1952, the iron and steel products supported by Anshan Iron and Steel to various parts of the country were only enough to load 40,000 freight cars; in 1958, the products shipped to various parts of the country required 200,000 freight cars to carry them. If all the steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel last year were used to build steel bases, it would be enough to build eight iron and steel joint enterprises of the same scale as Baotou Steel.
    "Night-shining pearl," what a precious treasure that is. Today, people compare the complete sets of generator units manufactured by the three major power machinery plants in Harbin to "pearls." At the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, we saw the joy of the people of Jiangxi in building the Shangyou Hydropower Station. To express the excitement of the people of Jiangxi and their gratitude to the manufacturers of the "pearl," they used famous Jingdezhen porcelain teacups as gifts, and wrote on the cups: "Jiangxi's First Pearl," and sent them to the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant. In the hydropower stations in Ulabo in Xinjiang, Shizitan in Sichuan, Foziling in Anhui, Liulangdong in Yunnan, Xin'anjiang in Zhejiang, Gutian in Fujian, and Liuxihe in Guangdong, you can see the waterborne "pearls" sent by the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant. Harbin Boiler Factory's power station boilers are installed in 31 thermal power plants across the country.
    New-style machine tools, heavy-duty equipment, and electrical equipment produced in industrial cities such as Shenyang, Qiqihar, and Dalian-Lushun account for a large proportion of the country's total. If the new-style machine tools supplied by Shenyang to various parts of the country last year were gathered together, it would be enough to equip 17 large factories like the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. In many iron and steel enterprises and motor manufacturing plants across the country, you can see the large vertical lathes, roll grinders, and ingot peeling lathes, weighing 40 to 50 tons, manufactured by the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
    On the banks of the Songhua River in Jilin, loaded trains rumble across the Songhua River Bridge, carrying nearly a hundred kinds of chemical products produced in the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone to various parts of the country day and night. The three kinds of dyes it produced this year alone are enough for the people of the country to dye an average of seventeen feet of cloth per person. The Dalian Chemical Plant, located on the coast, also supports chemical product manufacturing plants and other industrial production units in various places with a large amount of basic chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and soda ash every year. From Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan, the new coal cities in the northeast corner of the motherland, to Fushun, the coal capital in the south, the coal mined day and night by the top ten coal mines in the Northeast is flowing continuously to various industrial production departments. The forest resources of the Northeast are even more uniquely endowed by nature. The Greater Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains are a sea of forests. Here grow lush and flourishing precious tree species such as Korean pine and larch, which are all high-quality timber necessary for building factories, erecting bridges, manufacturing ships, freight cars, and laying railways. The Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area, known as the "hometown of Korean pine," has transported tens of millions of cubic meters of timber to the country in recent years.
    Several factories in the Northeast that manufacture new-style transportation equipment send the latest and greatest products to equip transportation enterprises every day. Today, on the long highways of our country, on the railway lines with huge carrying capacity, and on the boundless East Sea, are running automobiles, locomotives, and ships manufactured in the Northeast. Last year, the workers of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant supplied a "Construction" type locomotive to the railway every two days on average. The new type of locomotives they manufacture are running on the lines of eight railway bureaus, including Beijing, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Zhengzhou. Large batches of Jiefang brand trucks produced by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are driving on all highways from the foothills of the Himalayas to the banks of the Heilongjiang River. They undertake heavy transportation tasks in national road transportation, especially in promoting the economic development of border areas, in exploiting the rich oil resources in the Northwest, and in developing the newly discovered primitive forests in the south of the motherland... playing a glorious role.
    The Northeast, the first industrial base of the motherland, is following the Party's teaching of "producing machinery and producing talents," producing large quantities of steel and machinery equipment, and at the same time cultivating batches of excellent talents to strengthen the power of emerging industrial bases. It is like a large melting pot, making people tempered and grown; it is like a big university, making people increase their knowledge and improve their skills. Cadres and soldiers transferred from organs and troops, and young people sent from schools and rural areas, who were originally ignorant of industry, become experienced and skilled insiders after living here for two years. Then, they go to new factories in batches to shoulder the heavy responsibility of industrial construction. In recent years, Shenyang, a mechanical industrial city, has sent more than 70,000 technical workers and management cadres to various parts of the country. This number exceeds the total number of employees in Shenyang in the early days of liberation. Since 1954, Anshan Iron and Steel has been sending experienced and skilled cadres and workers to newly built factories in various places in batches. Up to now, more than 11,000 cadres and more than 60,000 technical workers have been scattered in industrial and mining enterprises in 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. They include company managers and factory directors, as well as construction site directors and team leaders, from engineers to technical workers, with iron smelters, steelmakers, and steel rollers. During the first five-year plan period, 20,000 technicians in Dalian-Lushun supported the nation. In the emerging power machinery manufacturing base, the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant is cultivating and transporting talents for hydropower equipment manufacturing plants across the country. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant sent complete sets of management cadres and technical workers to the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. The Fushun Artificial Petroleum Plant is also transporting complete sets of technical workers and cadres to a newly built giant artificial petroleum plant. The Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone are both newly built factories, but they are also sending a large number of talents to the country.
    Among the talents sent by the Northeast to the country, there are skilled engineers and technicians, nationally known model workers, and production experts who have returned from studying in the Soviet Union. They said: "New factories have many difficulties, and the beginning is difficult." Therefore, they always send the best workers and cadres to the new factories. Among those sent by the Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting Plant to Wuhan Iron and Steel were Zhou Chuandian and Li Fengen, nationally famous model workers. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant sent 31 production backbones who returned from studying in the Soviet Union to 29 locations across the country. In the year after Li Fengen was transferred away, his former assistant Zhao Zhijiu took over his work, but soon he was transferred to Baotou Steel.
    The Northeast industrial base, full of vitality, can today take her vigorous steps and walk at the forefront of socialist industrialization; with her rich and colorful industrial products, she can radiate brilliant light in the great garden of national construction. This is precisely the victory of the Party's key construction policy, and the seeds sown by the hard work of the people across the country have blossomed and borne fruit on the fertile land of the Northeast. Recalling the years when large-scale industrial construction was carried out in various parts of the Northeast, the support of the whole country for the Northeast was truly meticulous. When the construction of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel urgently needed riggers, the Hengyang Railway Administration of Hunan Province, thousands of miles away, knew about it and immediately called the railway sub-bureaus in Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places overnight to ask them to send people to Hengyang to study the problem of supporting riggers. At that time, the south-central region was carrying out the Jingjiang diversion project, and most of the riggers had gone to build bridges and sluice gates. Under such circumstances, they still extracted 120 excellent riggers and sent them to the Anshan Iron and Steel construction site. The people across the country sent 110,000 excellent children to Anshan Iron and Steel with such actions over the years. In the factories manufacturing equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel, they selected the best machine tools to process the equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel. Workers raced to do any work with the word "An" stamped on the drawings, and always completed it ahead of schedule. During the years of construction in the Northeast, people from all over the country provided people and equipment, supporting more than just one Anshan Iron and Steel. In some factories and enterprises in Shenyang and Dalian-Lushun, people will encounter cadres who were transferred from rural areas in North China to support industrial construction; in the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Jilin Chemical Industrial Zone, and the three major power plants in Harbin, people will hear the voices of producers speaking in various accents, many of whom come from distant Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangxi...
    Today, the production of this industrial base is still inseparable from the support of the whole country, and requires close cooperation from fraternal factories and enterprises in various places. Many products manufactured on the Northeast industrial base, whether it is a machine tool, an automobile, or a set of power generation equipment, can be sent to various places as complete sets of products, all thanks to the result of national production cooperation. With the cooperation of more than 70 factories across the country, the automobiles manufactured by the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant can be completely delivered from the factory and driven to various places. Although the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is currently the first factory in the country to manufacture special equipment for railway factories, its production of machine tools cannot be separated from the supply of auxiliary equipment from Shanghai, Tianjin, Luoyang, and other places. The rich ore used for smelting in Anshan Iron and Steel, the important raw material for motor manufacturing - mica, and some light industrial products used in the lives of the people in the Northeast all need the continued support of fraternal factories across the country. The people of the Northeast have personally experienced that only under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as one chess game" can the emerging industrial base in the Northeast be built quickly; and only under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as one chess game" can it play a greater role in supporting the economic construction of the country.

　　从全国支援到支援全国
　　本报记者　谷峰、孙若刚、孙铭惠、康国志
    祖国辽阔富饶的东北，在党中央英明的领导和全国人民的大力支援下，已经建成为一个强大的工业基地。在这块八十多万平方公里的土地上，南部是人民的钢都鞍山，机械名城沈阳，煤都抚顺，煤铁之城本溪的所在地——辽宁省。全省十座各具特色的工业城市，组成了以钢铁、机械、煤炭等重工业为中心的工业基地。北部的黑龙江省，是个新兴的工业区。新建的现代化的大工业，使它成为我国制造重型机械设备和大型电站设备的重要基地。它那小兴安岭的珍贵木材，鸡西、双鸭山的优质炼焦煤，在国家的经济建设中放出光辉的异彩。中部的吉林省，新建的汽车、机车、车辆等制造工业和规模巨大的吉林化工区，使它踏上了现代工业的行列。东北工业已经彻底扫除了解放以前殖民地的痕迹，成为一个独立的体系了。现在，东北地区，既有各种金属原料的生产基地，又有为其服务的强大的煤炭和电力工业；既有包括各个独立生产部门的机械制造业，又有与之相适应的配件生产、工具制造和机械修配网；既有一系列的生产部门，又有为其服务的发达的交通运输事业；既有强大的重工业部门，又有比较发达的轻工业。在全国人民全力支援下建设起来的东北工业基地，正在以它的强大的生产能力支援着全国的社会主义建设。
    现在，这些现代化的工业部门，正以日夜生产的大量先进的技术装备，和辛勤培养的成千上万的技术人材，去武装正在我国各地兴建的新的工业基地。
    从东北最大的铁路运输集结点——苏家屯车站的调车场和锦州车站上，就会看到那川流不息的列车，满载着这里生产的各种钢材，重型和精密的机床，巨大的发电设备，崭新的汽车，效率强大的机车，金黄色的木材，黑亮的煤炭，还有那一批批生产建设工人，开赴武钢、包钢和全国许多建设基地。这时候，你才会亲切地感到，这个用全国人民的心血哺育长大的工业基地，她在社会主义建设中显示的力量是多么雄伟。人们记得，还是在东北全境解放不久，人们正以奋发的劳动热情，医治破坏创伤的时候，英明的党就向全国人民发出了伟大的召唤：一定要把东北建设成全国工业化的重大基地。从那时起，一批一批的干部，成千上万的工人，从全国各个战线来到这里，开始了史无前例的规模宏伟的工业建设。十年过去了，今天东北地区正责无旁贷地去为全国的经济建设出力报效。“充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国，逐步合理发展”，几年来早已成了东北各级党委一切工作的指针；“一切为了全国”，变成了东北广大职工的行动口号。
    东北这个强大的工业基地，几年来支援了全国多少工业产品，向全国输送了多少建设人材，现在还无法作出精确的统计；这个基地上所有的工业企业，不论是现代化的大工业，还是中小型的地方工业，都在为支援全国奋勇前进，付出了自己的全部力量。它们表现出来的先国家后地方，全力保证重点的事例，是说不完道不尽的。还在去年12月，包钢焦炉烘炉时，到处买不到热电偶，没有它就不能烘炉。最后，还是从鞍钢拿到了四十支热电偶。无怪乎建设包钢的人们，常常亲切地称鞍钢为“娘家”。他们一谈起鞍钢对包钢的热情支援就说：“包钢缺什么，‘娘家’就给什么。”最近，鞍钢为了换修焦化厂的裂化管，专门轧制出一批自用的合金管。正在这个时候，包钢也来要求支援这种合金管。一面是自己急待重换裂化管，一面是包钢建设中急需这种钢管。孰急孰缓似乎难以权衡，但是，鞍钢的领导却毫不犹豫地决定把这批合金管送给包钢。现在，全国各地到处都有鞍钢支援的越来越多的钢材。1952年，鞍钢支援全国各地的钢铁产品，只够装四万个车皮；1958年运往全国各地的产品，就需要二十万个车皮载运了。如果把鞍钢去年一年生产的钢材，全都用来建设钢铁基地，足够建成八个具有包钢那样规模的钢铁联合企业。
    “夜明珠”，这是多么珍贵的宝物。今天，人们却把哈尔滨三大动力机械厂制造的全套发电机组譬作“明珠”。在哈尔滨电机厂里，我们看到了江西人民建成上犹水电站的喜悦。为了表达江西人民兴奋的心情和对“明珠”制造者的感激，他们用景德镇的名瓷茶杯作礼物，在杯上写着：“江西第一颗明珠”，送给哈尔滨电机厂。在新疆的乌拉泊，四川的狮子滩，安徽的佛子岭，云南的六郎洞，浙江的新安江，福建的古田和广东的流溪河等地的水电站里，你都可以看到哈尔滨电机厂送去的水上“明珠”。在全国三十一个火电站里安装着哈尔滨锅炉厂制造的电站锅炉。
    沈阳、齐齐哈尔和旅大等工业城市生产的新式机床、重型设备和电器设备，在全国占了很大比重。如果把沈阳去年一年供给全国各地的新式机床，集中在一起，足够装备成十七个像沈阳第一机床厂那样的大工厂。在全国各地的许多钢铁企业和电机制造厂里，都能看到齐齐哈尔第一机床厂制造的四、五十吨重的大型立式车床，轧辊磨床，钢锭剥皮车床等重型设备。
    在吉林松花江畔，满载的列车隆隆地驶过松花江大桥，把吉林化工区出产的近百种化工产品，日夜不停地运往全国。单是它今年生产的三种染料，就够全国人民平均每人染十七尺布。位于海滨的大连化工厂，每年也以大量的硫酸、烧碱和纯碱等基本化工原料，去支援各地化学产品制造厂和其它工业生产单位。从祖国东北角上的煤炭新城鹤岗、鸡西、双鸭山，南到煤都抚顺，东北十大煤矿日夜开采的煤炭，正在源源流向各地工业生产部门。东北的森林资源更是得天独厚，兴安岭和长白山是一片林海。这里生长着苍郁繁茂的红松、落叶松等珍贵的树种，都是建筑厂房、架设桥梁、制造轮船、货车和铺设铁路等必需的优质木材。素称“红松故乡”的小兴安岭林区，几年来运往全国的木材达几千万立方米。
    东北几个制造新式交通运输设备的工厂，每天都把最新的大量产品去装备交通运输企业。如今，在我国漫长的公路上，在运量巨大的铁路线上，在波涛万顷的东海面上，都行驶着东北制造的汽车、机车和船舶。大连机车车辆厂的工人，去年平均每两天就给铁路输送一台“建设”型机车。他们制造的新型机车，正奔驰在北京、太原、济南、郑州等八个铁路局所属的线路上。第一汽车制造厂出产的大批解放牌载重汽车，行驶在从喜马拉雅山麓到黑龙江边的各条公路上。在全国公路运输中，它们担负着繁重的运输任务，特别是对促进边疆地区的经济发展，在开采西北丰富的石油，开发祖国南方新发现的原始森林中……，更起着光辉的作用。
    东北，祖国的第一个工业基地，她正在遵循着党的“出机器，出人材”的教导，生产着大量的钢材和机器设备，同时培养出一批批优秀的人材，来加强新兴工业基地的力量。她像一个大熔炉，使人锻炼成长；她像一座大学校，使人增长知识提高本领。从机关、部队转来的干部、军人，从学校、农村送来的青年，原来是工业上一窍不通的门外汉，在这里住上两年，就会成了有经验有技术的内行人。于是，他们又从这里一批一批地奔赴新的工厂，担起工业建设的重担。几年来，沈阳这个机械工业城市，输送给全国各地的技术工人和管理干部就有七万多人。这个数字超过沈阳解放初期职工的总数。鞍钢，从1954年以来，就把有经验有技术的干部、工人一批批地送给各地新建的工厂。到现在，已经有一万一千多名干部和六万多名技术工人，分散在全国二十七个省、市和自治区的工矿企业里。他们，有公司的经理和厂矿长，也有工地主任和工段长，从工程师到技术工人，炼铁的、炼钢的、轧钢的应有尽有。在第一个五年计划期间，旅大市有两万名技职人员支援了全国。在新兴的动力机械制造基地的哈尔滨电机厂，正在为全国各地水力发电设备制造厂培养和输送人材。哈尔滨量具刃具厂为成都量具刃具厂送去了成套的管理干部和技术工人。抚顺人造石油厂，也在向一个新建的巨大人造石油厂，输送全套的技术工人和干部。长春第一汽车厂和吉林化工区，都是建成不久的新厂，但它们也都为全国输送着大批的人材。
    在东北送给全国的人材中，有技术熟练的工程师、技术人员，有名闻全国的劳动模范，也有从苏联学习回来的生产能手。他们说：“新厂的困难多，开头难”。所以总是把最优秀的工人和干部送给新厂。鞍钢炼铁厂送给武钢的就有全国有名的劳动模范周传典、李凤恩。无缝钢管厂把从苏联学习回来的三十一名生产骨干送给全国各地二十九名。在李凤恩调走后的一年里，他原来的助手赵志久接替了他的工作，可是不久，他又被调给了包钢。
    充满着生命活力的东北工业基地，今天能以她那矫健的步伐，走在社会主义工业化的最前列；能够以她那丰富多采的工业产品，在祖国建设的大花园里散发着灿烂的光辉，这正是党的重点建设方针的胜利，全国人民用辛勤劳动撒下的种子，在富饶的东北大地上开花结果了。回想当东北各地进行大规模工业建设的年月，全国对东北的支援，真是无微不至。当鞍钢三大工程施工中急需架工时，千里迢迢的湖南省衡阳铁路管理局知道了，连夜打电话给广州、桂林等铁路分局，让立即派人到衡阳来研究支援架工的问题。当时，中南地区正在进行荆江分洪工程，大部架工都修桥修闸去了，就在这种情况下，他们还是抽出了一百二十名优秀的架工送到鞍钢工地。全国人民就以这样的行动，几年来，给鞍钢送来了十一万优秀儿女。在为鞍钢制造设备的工厂里，都挑最好的机床加工鞍钢的设备，凡是图纸上盖个“鞍”字的活，工人们都抢着干，而且总是提前完成。在东北建设的年月，全国各地，出人出设备，何止支援了一个鞍钢。在沈阳和旅大的一些工厂企业中，人们会遇到当时从华北农村调来支援工业建设的干部；在长春第一汽车厂、吉林化工区、哈尔滨三大动力厂里，人们会听到操着各方口音的生产者中，有许多是来自远方的上海、广东、四川、江西……。
    今天，在这个工业基地的生产中，仍然离不开全国的支援，需要各地兄弟工厂企业的密切合作。东北工业基地上制造的许多产品，不论是一台机床、一辆汽车，或是一套发电设备，它能够成为完整的成套的产品被送往各地，都是全国生产大协作的结果。在全国七十多个工厂的协作配合下，长春第一汽车厂制造的一辆辆汽车，才能完整地出厂开往各地。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂，虽然是目前全国第一家制造铁路工厂专用设备的工厂，但在它生产的机床上，却离不开上海、天津、洛阳等地供给的配属设备。鞍钢冶炼用的富矿石，电机制造的重要原料——云母，东北人民生活中用的一些轻工业产品，都需要全国各地兄弟工厂的继续支援。东北人民亲身体验到只有在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，东北这个新兴的工业基地才能迅速建设起来；也只有在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，它在支援全国的经济建设中，才能发挥出更大的作用。
