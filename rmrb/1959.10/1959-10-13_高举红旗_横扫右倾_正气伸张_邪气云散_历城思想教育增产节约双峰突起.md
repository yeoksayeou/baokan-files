Hold High the Red Flag, Sweep Away Right-leaning Tendencies, Uphold Righteousness, Dispel Evil
Licheng's Ideological Education Achieves a Double Peak in Increased Production and Thrift

(Our Dispatch) Spurred by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of Licheng County, Shandong Province, are holding even higher the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, sweeping away right-leaning tendencies, and advancing bravely, rapidly pushing both the socialist and communist ideological education movement and the mass movement for increased production and thrift to new heights.

Now, Licheng County is filled with a jubilant and vibrant new atmosphere. The broad masses of people are using the facts of their own experiences to launch a sweeping battle against the erroneous words and deeds of a few right-leaning opportunists, greatly upholding righteousness and completely dispelling evil. The socialist ideological front has been further consolidated, the political vision of cadres and the masses has become sharper, the road has become clearer, and the confidence and drive for the Great Leap Forward have become greater. In production, the late autumn overproduction competition of various People's Communes is in full swing, while the three-autumn campaign (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) is also surging forward. A force of 40,000 engaged in autumn vegetable management is currently applying fertilizer and water, preventing pests and diseases, and striving for a total output of 500 million catties from 80,000 mu of autumn vegetables. A force of 230,000 engaged in autumn sowing has unanimously resolved to launch a leap forward plan for sowing 540,000 mu of wheat (compared to 350,000 mu in 1959) with an average yield of 400 catties per mu (compared to 208 catties in 1959), and has initiated a 1960 wheat bumper harvest competition proposal to all counties and cities in the province. The broad masses of commune members have launched a movement to find opponents, learn from advanced examples, catch up with advanced examples, think of solutions, and add measures, with more than 100,000 people camping in the fields every day, competing openly and secretly, working hard day and night. The scale, speed, and quality of the three-autumn campaign have greatly exceeded those of the Great Leap Forward autumn of last year. At present, the county has plowed more than 450,000 mu of land and sown 300,000 mu, two to three times more than the same period last year. The three communes of Ganggou, Zhonggong, etc., and more than 130 production teams have completed about 95% of their entire wheat planting plan. Moreover, they have generally achieved land leveling, standardized ridge fields, systematized channels, and standardized sowing specifications.

This infinitely good new situation is the glorious result of actively implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, thoroughly opposing right-leaning tendencies, and boosting morale. Licheng County has gained four vivid and powerful experiences in this movement:

First, resolutely, quickly, universally, and thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session. Experience has proven that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are the soul of all work, the general program guiding the current movement, and the concentrated expression of the will of the broad masses of people. Therefore, once it comes into contact with the masses, it becomes a huge material force. The faster it comes into contact with the masses, the earlier its effect is produced; the more thoroughly it is implemented, the higher the morale of the masses; and the less room there is for right-leaning opportunist thoughts, words, and deeds and all kinds of erroneous arguments to stand. For example, during the severe drought in August, some right-leaning opportunists took the opportunity to stir up trouble and spread pessimistic arguments, causing the drought resistance movement to progress slowly. However, when the central government's instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement for increased production and thrift were conveyed, the masses quickly launched a drought resistance struggle. Immediately following the criticism of the "fixed production theory," an unprecedented late autumn overproduction movement was launched. All 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes and 80,000 mu of autumn vegetables in the county were universally fertilized once in three to five days. In September, when Licheng County was preparing to systematically implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, some people mistakenly believed that holding meetings to implement the spirit of the central government's resolutions was in contradiction with work. They advocated doing things slowly and step by step. The Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that this was actually a lack of understanding of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a right-leaning manifestation of separating thought from work. The Licheng County Committee took the most resolute, quickest, most universal, and most thorough actions, and used the method of vigorously launching mass movements, acting swiftly and resolutely, dispatching all propaganda forces and propaganda tools day and night, so that the Party's resolutions could quickly meet the masses. The morale of the masses soared unprecedentedly, and the original planned wheat planting area was expanded to 470,000 mu. Some communes and production teams reflected that there was insufficient fertilizer and a shortage of labor, and they could not plant well. This time, everyone was invigorated and added measures one after another, expanding the wheat planting area to 540,000 mu.

During this period, the Licheng County Committee vigorously mobilized the masses on the one hand, and convened a three-level cadre meeting on the other hand, so that solving the leadership problem was combined with mobilizing the masses, and the meeting was combined with work. The more than 700 cadres who participated in the three-level cadre meeting studied and linked with their own communes and production teams. Those who were lacking in drive rushed back overnight to add fuel and code, and returned to the meeting before dawn. Later, they could no longer sit still, so the county committee simply approved their absence from the meeting for three days. The 700 people were like a group of tigers descending the mountain, and they quickly conveyed the spirit of the meeting to the people of the county. The backbone led the masses, and the masses inspired the backbone, combining from top to bottom, and promoting each other. When the meetings of cadres at all levels came to an end, the spirit of the central resolution also penetrated deeply into the hearts of the masses; when the three-level cadres launched a competition at the meeting, the county's production movement had formed a new high tide of enthusiasm.

Second, only through carrying out systematic socialist mass self-education movements by implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China can right-leaning tendencies be thoroughly eliminated and morale be boosted. After conveying and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, the Licheng County Committee paid attention to letting all cadres and the masses open up their minds, speak out freely, and debate freely. In the midst of speaking out and debating, a few right-leaning opportunists slandered the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the Great Steelmaking Movement. The broad masses of people, through recalling and comparing their own experiences, presented facts and reasoned things out, giving a crushing blow to the rumors and slanders of right-leaning opportunists, and a powerful rebuttal to all kinds of erroneous arguments. For example, at the three-level cadre meeting, someone said: "The People's Communes were established too early, the communes are not as good as the advanced cooperatives, and the small cooperatives can achieve a greater leap forward." Everyone cited the following facts to answer him: After communization, the county saw the embryonic form of mechanization and electrification. Now each commune has 20 seeders, 18 harvesters, more than 6,000 horsepower of water pumps, 7 power stations, 500 electric machines, 320 electric wells, modern means of transport such as automobiles and trailers, and a large number of tractors, threshers, and so on. These modern large-scale agricultural machinery and equipment were very rare in the advanced cooperatives. In the past year, from shaking the well sweep to operating electric water pumps, from using wooden plows to using tractors, this is such a big leap. Three years ago, people were idealizing "cultivating the land without cattle, lighting lamps without oil, watering the fields without a well sweep, and pulling on electricity to flow," and now, one year after communization, it has become a reality; after communization, in terms of grain production, the county's average yield per mu reached 450 catties in 1958, an increase of 130 catties over 1957, and it is expected to reach 600 catties this year; after communization, a large number of collective welfare undertakings have been established, women are not worried about having too many children, single men are not worried about the difficulty of eating, old people are not worried about not having children, and the sick are not worried about the difficulty of seeking medical treatment. Therefore, everyone criticized those who said the communes were not good as inverting black and white and distorting the truth. Some people also said: "Since communization is so good, why is the supply of some materials tight, such as soap, which is not as ample as last year?" Everyone immediately cited Hongjialou Village as an example. This village has a total of 540 households. In the past, they did not use soap at all for washing clothes, but used plant ash. Now, they generally use soap for washing clothes and fragrant soap for washing faces. Since the beginning of this year, the sales of fragrant soap have increased by two and a half times compared with the same period last year. This shows that it is not that there are fewer materials, but that there is more money. In 1949, the average income per person in the county was 20 yuan, which reached 70 yuan in 1958, and it is expected to reach 173 yuan this year. Some right-leaning opportunists also said: "The Great Steelmaking Movement did not pay off." In fact, Licheng County had no iron last year, and the iron materials used for repairing and manufacturing tractors, water pumps, electric motors, and more than 250,000 pieces of large and small agricultural implements this year are basically self-produced and self-sufficient. Solving a problem in one year that has not been solved for thousands of years, how can it be said that it "did not pay off"?

The broad masses of people, from recalling their own experiences in the ten years since the founding of the country, the three years of cooperativization, and the one year of communization, summed up "ten major changes," "ten major superiorities," and "five major insurances." The ten major changes are that the relations of production have changed; the productive forces have greatly developed; the production conditions have greatly changed; production has greatly developed and output has increased several times; production technology has developed by leaps and bounds; the living standards of the masses have greatly improved; there has been a great cultural revolution; collective welfare undertakings have greatly developed; the status of the working people has greatly improved; and the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of peasants has also undergone profound changes. A large number of rich, colorful, vivid, and lively facts not only made right-leaning opportunists admit defeat, and made all kinds of erroneous arguments untenable, but also provided all cadres and the broad masses with a vivid socialist education, and also an extremely practical and profound class education.

In recalling the tremendous changes, the broad masses also checked their specific performance in the past movements based on their own experience, and summed up the following lessons: First, resolutely following the Party and Chairman Mao can lead to victory after victory. Commune members in the East Suburb Commune recalled when summing up the ten years of changes: in 1954, right-leaning opportunists wanted to "shrink" cooperativization and suffered a loss. In 1955, Chairman Mao put forward the opposition to small-footed women walking, which brought about the high tide of cooperativization and the great harvest of 1956; by 1957, the Party led the great rectification movement, repelling the frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie, and achieved another unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958. This year, as soon as right-leaning tendencies emerged, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued a call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale. It seems that leaving the Party by one step has the danger of losing direction. Second, firmly taking the socialist road can lead to common development and wealth for generations. They said: The small-scale peasant economy is like peach blossoms in March, which cannot withstand wind and rain. Engaging in mutual assistance and cooperation gets rid of poverty and embarks on the road to wealth. Establishing People's Communes is like ascending to heaven, cutting off the roots of poverty. Third, holding high the red flag of the Party's General Line, forging ahead courageously is victory, and being slow, poor, and wasteful will lead to failure. The fourth team of the North Beach Head Brigade of the East Suburb Commune suffered an estimated loss of 24,000 yuan this year due to the right-leaning conservative thinking and passive work of the team leader. The tenth team leader had sufficient drive and did a good job, being able to harvest more than 20,000 catties of grain. These vivid facts profoundly educated the masses. They said, "Right-leaning tendencies must be thoroughly opposed, and the General Line must be held higher and higher." Fourth, the tremendous changes in the past ten years are inseparable from the state's support and the support of the worker brothers. It is necessary to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, urban-rural mutual assistance, and support the country. In short, everyone unanimously believes that the road in the past ten years has been correct. The faster you go, the more benefits you get, step by step higher, step by step sweeter, and being slow, poor, and wasteful is extremely harmful. In the future, we must resolutely follow this path, without wavering, without deviating, without stopping, and without taking shortcuts under any circumstances. When encountering evil winds and evil spirits, resolutely resist.

Third, integrate thought and work into one rope. In the process of implementing the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in solving the problem of combining meetings and production, ideological education and practical action, in addition to firmly grasping the problem of ideological line, so that it penetrates deeply into the current movement, the Licheng County Committee also used several specific methods to completely integrate thought and work into one rope. During the three-level cadre meeting held in the county: 1. From the county to the production team, they were divided into two fronts: meeting and production; 2. Organize three-level cadre inspection teams to go deep into the fields, discover problems, and solve them specifically; 3. Ideological meetings are combined with work meetings. At the beginning of the meeting, the cadres in charge of work at home in the county, commune, and team went to the county to listen to the report together, and then held on-site meetings. Cadres inside and outside the meeting discussed realities and theories together to help the cadres who went back to preside over the work to arrange the work specifically. In the middle, they took a break for three days to allow all cadres who participated in the three-level cadre meeting to organize current production and respond to the Party's call with practical actions; 4. The county's three-level cadre meeting and the small team leader cadre meeting of the base point commune East Suburb Commune were held at the same time, and four teams were selected at the same time to thoroughly and systematically mobilize the masses, so that the leadership and the masses were combined. When the three-level cadre meeting ended, the county committee promptly came up with a set of experiences in mobilizing the masses to arm the grassroots leaders. When the movement deepened into the masses, studying the resolution, speaking out freely, recalling and comparing, focusing on debates, planning production, organizing competitions, evaluating inspections, etc., were carried out together. Cadres went deep into the fields and factories separately, leading production on the one hand, and leading discussions on the other hand. Big discussions during rest, small discussions during labor, and discussions while watching at on-site meetings naturally integrated thought and action together. As a result of this, with the formation of an ideological upsurge, a situation of all-round Great Leap Forward in various tasks appeared. For example, September was the tense stage of the three-autumn campaign, the autumn plowing and autumn sowing progressed quickly and were of high quality, and at the same time, the tasks of purchasing live pigs and fresh eggs were completed ten days ahead of schedule. The commercial departments wanted to purchase 200,000 catties of lotus roots to support the cities, and the result was completed in two days.

Fourth, lead the movement to a climax through competition. Licheng County's experience proves that competition is the conscious demand of the masses after awakening. Through competition, the soaring political enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people can be better directed to actual movements, and the production upsurge can be pushed to a regular and lasting consolidation stage. The Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has successively organized three competitive upsurges in more than a month—drought resistance, late autumn management, and the three-autumn campaign, one wave higher than the other. The important methods of organizing the competition are: mass creation of models, inserting red flags, finding opponents, and chain linking. The consistent goal of the county: learn from, catch up with, and surpass Shouzhang in grain production, learn from, catch up with, and surpass Linqing in cotton production, learn from, catch up with, and surpass Gaotang in industrial production, and learn from, catch up with, and surpass Wulian in diversified economic production. Each commune has also established 25 advanced teams and 1,200 advanced individuals, so that there are clear and specific "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" objects among all industries and all types of people, with clear goals and specific conditions, and the competition movement is burning hotter and hotter. More than 235,000 people in the county are involved in the wave, making the competitive torrent penetrate from commune to commune and from person to person. Now, among the ten People's Communes and 585 production brigades, seven communes have participated in the inter-commune competition initiative of "600-catties wheat communes" or more, and 180 teams have participated in the inter-team competition of "800-catties wheat teams."

　　高举红旗　横扫右倾　正气伸张　邪气云散
    历城思想教育增产节约双峰突起
    本报讯　在党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，山东历城县全县人民，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，横扫右倾，奋勇前进，迅速地把社会主义、共产主义思想教育运动和增产节约群众运动同时推向新的高潮。
    现在，历城县到处是欢跃沸腾的新气象。广大群众用他们自己切身经历的事实，向少数右倾机会主义者的错误言行，展开了扫荡战，正气大为伸张，邪气烟消云散。社会主义思想阵地更加巩固了，干部和群众的政治眼光更锐敏了，道路更明确了，跃进信心和干劲更大了。在生产上，各人民公社的晚秋超产竞赛方兴未艾，而三秋运动又巨浪滔天。四万名秋菜管理大军，正在追肥加水，防治虫害，争取八万亩秋菜总产五亿斤；二十三万名秋种队伍，一致决议以种麦五十四万亩（1959年三十五万亩），平均单产四百斤（1959年二百零八斤）的跃进计划，向全省各县、市发起了1960年小麦丰产竞赛倡议。广大社员掀起了各找对手，学先进、赶先进，想办法、加措施的运动，每天有十万多人在田间安营扎寨，明争暗比，日夜苦战。三秋运动规模之大，进度之快，质量之高，都大大超过了去年大跃进的秋天。目前全县已耕翻地四十五万多亩，播种三十万亩，比去年同时增多两、三倍。港沟、仲宫等三个公社和一百三十多个生产队，已经完成整个种麦计划的95％左右。而且普遍达到了土地平整化，畦田标准化，渠道系统化，播种规格化的要求。
    这种无限良好的新形势，是积极贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，反透右倾，鼓足干劲的光辉成果。历城县在这次运动中，获得了四条生动有力的经验：
    第一、坚决、迅速、普遍、彻底地贯彻八中全会决议。经验证明：党的八中全会决议是一切工作的灵魂，是指导当前运动的总纲，是广大群众意志的集中表现。因此，一经和群众接触，就变成巨大的物质力量。越是和群众接触的快，产生的作用越早，越是贯彻的深透，群众情绪越高，右倾机会主义思想言行和形形色色的错误论调，越无立足之地。例如8月大旱时期，有些右倾机会主义分子，趁机兴风作浪，散布悲观论调，使抗旱运动进展迟缓。但是当传达了中央反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的指示以后，群众很快展开抗旱斗争。紧接着批判“增产定局论”，又掀起史无前例的晚秋超产运动。全县四十万亩甘薯，八万亩秋菜，在三、五天内，即普遍追了一遍肥。9月，历城县准备系统地贯彻八中全会决议和山东省委扩大会议精神时，有人错误的认为开会贯彻中央决议精神和工作有矛盾。他们主张按部就班的慢慢来。中共历城县委认为：这实际上是对中央八中全会精神认识不足，把思想和工作割裂开来的一种右倾表现。历城县委采取了最坚决、最迅速、最普遍、最彻底的行动和轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动的方法，雷厉风行，星夜出动所有宣传力量和宣传工具，使党的决议很快和群众见面。群众情绪空前高涨，原来准备种麦面积扩大到四十七万亩，有些公社和生产队反映肥料不足，劳力紧张，不能种好。这一来，人人振奋，纷纷加添措施，把种麦面积扩大到五十四万亩。
    在这个期间，历城县委一面大力发动群众，一面召开三级干部会议，使解决领导问题和发动群众相结合，会议和工作相结合。参加三级干部会的七百多名干部，边学习、边和本社本队联系，凡是差把劲的，星夜赶回去加油加码，天不明再返回来参加会议，后来再也坐不住了，县委就索性批准他们休会三天，七百人犹如群虎下山，一下把会议精神传达给全县人民。骨干带领着群众，群众激励着骨干，上下结合，互相促进。当各级干部会议结束之时，中央决议精神，也深透到群众的心；当三级干部在会上发起竞赛之时，全县生产运动已形成热火朝天的新高潮了。
    第二、通过贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，开展系统的社会主义群众自我教育运动，才能彻底反掉右倾，鼓足干劲。历城县委在传达贯彻八届八中全会决议和山东省委扩大会议精神以后，即注意放手发动全体干部和群众敞开思想，大鸣大放，自由争辩。在鸣放辩论中，少数右倾机会主义者污蔑大跃进、人民公社、大办钢铁运动。广大群众通过回忆对比，从切身经历中摆事实，讲道理，给右倾机会主义分子的造谣污蔑以粉碎性的打击，给各种形形色色的错误言论以有力的驳斥。例如三级干部会上，有人说：“人民公社办早了，公社不如高级社，小社更能大跃进。”大家举出下列事实回答了他：公社化后全县出现了机械化、电气化的雏型。现在各公社有播种机二十部、收割机十八部、抽水机六千多个马力、发电站七处、电力机五百台、电力井三百二十眼，现代运输工具如汽车、拖车等八十多辆，还有大批拖拉机、脱谷机等等。这些现代化的大型农业机械设备，在高级社时还很少很少。一年来，由摇辘辘头到开电动抽水机，由用木犁到使拖拉机，这是多么大的飞跃。人们头三年还理想着“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油，浇地不用辘辘头，一拉电把哗哗流”，而今，公社化一年来就变成现实了；公社化后在粮食生产上，1958年全县亩产达到四百五十斤，比1957年增加一百三十斤，今年预计能达到六百斤；公社化后办起了大量的集体福利事业，妇女不愁孩子多了，单身汉不愁吃饭难了，老人不愁没儿女，有病不愁求医难了。因此，大家斥责那些说公社不好的人是颠倒黑白，歪曲真理。还有人说：“公社化既然这么好，为什么有些物资供应紧张，如肥皂还不如去年宽裕？”大家立即举出洪家楼村为例，这个村共有五百四十户，过去洗衣服根本不用肥皂，用草木灰，而现在普遍使用肥皂洗衣，香皂洗脸，今年以来已经销售的香皂比去年同期增加两倍半。这说明不是物资少了，而是钱多了。1949年全县平均每人收入为二十元，1958年达到七十元，今年预计能达到一百七十三元。还有些右倾机会主义分子说：“大办钢铁得不偿失”，其实，历城县去年还无寸铁，今年修制拖拉机、水泵、电动机及大小农具二十五万多件所用的铁料，基本上是自产自给的。一年解决了几千年来没能解决的问题，怎么还说是“得不偿失”？
    广大群众从回忆建国十年来、合作化三年来、公社化一年来的切身经历中，共总结了“十大变化”、“十大优越”、“五大保险”。十大变化是生产关系变化了；生产力大大发展了；生产条件大大改变了；生产大发展产量增几倍；生产技术飞跃发展；群众生活水平大大提高；文化大翻身；集体福利事业大发展；劳动群众地位大大提高；广大农民精神面貌也发生了深刻变化。大量丰富多彩、生动活泼的事实，不仅使右倾机会主义分子服输，使形形色色的错误言论立不住脚，对全体干部和广大群众都是一次生动的社会主义教育，也是一次极为实际、深刻的阶级教育。
    广大群众在回忆巨大变化中，还根据自己的切身体会，检查了在历次运动中的具体表现，总结出了以下几条经验教训：一、坚决跟着党和毛主席走，才能从胜利走向胜利。东郊公社社员总结十年变化时回忆说：1954年右倾机会主义分子要“收缩”合作化，吃了一下亏，1955年毛主席就提出反对小脚女人走路，带来了合作化高潮和1956年的大丰收；到1957年党领导伟大的整风运动，打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，又取得1958年的空前大跃进，今年右倾刚一露头，党中央和毛主席就发出反右倾、鼓干劲的号召，看起来一步离开党就有迷失方向的危险。二、坚定走社会主义道路，才能共同发展，万代富裕。他们说：小农经济是三月里桃花，经不起风吹雨打，搞了互助合作，摆脱了贫困，走上富裕道路，办了人民公社，就升入天堂，斩断了穷根。三、高举党的总路线红旗，勇往直前，就是胜利，少慢差费就要失败。东郊公社北滩头大队第四小队由于队长存在右倾保守思想，工作消极，今年约计损失二万四千元。第十小队队长干劲足，搞的好，能多收两万多斤粮食。这些生动的事实，深刻地教育了群众，他们说“右倾非反透不可，总路线要举得高了再高。”四、十年巨变和国家扶持、工人老大哥的支援是分不开的，必须加强工农联盟，城乡互助，支援国家。总之大家一致认为：十年的路子走对了。走得越快，好处越多，步步登高，步步甜，少慢差费害处无穷。今后要坚决按这个路走下去，在任何情况下，不动摇，不发岔，不停脚，不走小道。遇着歪风邪气，坚决顶住。
    第三、思想、工作拧成一股绳。历城县委在贯彻八届八中全会过程中，在解决开会和生产，思想教育和实际行动相结合的方法上，除了紧紧抓住思想路线问题，使之深透在当前运动中间以外，还运用了几个具体方法，使思想、工作完全拧成一股绳，在县里召开三级干部会议期间：一、从县到生产队都分为开会和生产两条战线；二、组织三级干部检查组，深入田间，发现问题，具体解决；三、思想会套工作会，会议开始时，县、社、队在家主持工作的干部，一齐到县听报告，接着又召开现场会，会内会外干部一块就实论虚，帮助回去主持工作的干部把工作安排具体，中间又休会三天，让参加三级干部会的全体干部，组织当前生产，以实际行动响应党的号召；四、县三级干部会和基点社东郊公社的小队长以上干部会，同时召开，并同时选择四个队，深入系统的发动群众，使领导和群众结合，当三级干部会结束之时，县委及时拿出一套发动群众的经验，武装了基层领导。当运动深入到群众中间，学习决议，大鸣大放，回忆对比，重点辩论，计划生产，组织竞赛，评比检查等等，则一齐进行，干部分别深入田间、工厂，一面领导生产，一面领导讨论，休息时大论，劳动时小论，现场会边看边论，自然的把思想行动拧在一起了。这样搞的结果，随着思想高潮的形成，出现了各项工作全面大跃进的局面，如9月份正是三秋运动紧张阶段，秋耕秋种进度快质量高，而同时提前十天超额完成了生猪、鲜蛋收购任务。商业部门要收购二十万斤藕支援城市，结果两天就完成了。
    第四、通过竞赛把运动引向高潮。历城县的经验证明，竞赛是群众觉悟之后的自觉要求，通过竞赛，可以更好地把全党全民高涨的政治热情，引向实际运动中去，把生产高潮推向经常持久的巩固阶段。中共历城县委一个多月来，连续组织了三次竞赛高潮——抗旱、晚秋管理、三秋运动，一浪高一浪。组织竞赛的重要方法是：群众性的树标兵、插红旗、找对手、连环挂钩。全县一致的目标：粮食生产学、赶、超寿张，棉花生产学、赶、超临清。工业生产学、赶、超高唐，多种经济学、赶、超五莲。各社又树立了二十五个先进队，一千二百名先进人物，使各行各业各类人物之间，都有明确具体的“学、赶、超”对象，目标明确，条件具体，竞赛运动越烧越热。全县二十三万五千多人卷入浪潮，使竞赛巨流从社与社深入到人与人之间，现在十个人民公社、五百八十五个生产大队中，有七个公社参加了“小麦六百斤社”以上的社际竞赛倡议，一百八十个队参加了“小麦八百斤队”的队际竞赛。　　（胡雷）
