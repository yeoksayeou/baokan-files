The newspapers have already reported that the drought in Henan this year is the worst in decades, exceeding even that of 1942. In that year, Henan was a land of desolation, with three million lives lost and countless families selling their children. This year, however, the people of Henan have achieved a bumper harvest of 110 million mu of autumn crops. In northern Shanxi, a low-yield area plagued by barren land, wind, sand, and frost, not only has grain production increased significantly, but also oil production is more than self-sufficient. In Harbin, a city with low temperatures and short daylight hours that has always relied on southern provinces for vegetables, this year's autumn vegetable harvest alone is enough to feed the entire city for eight months. Is this a small change or a big change? Is it a small leap forward or a great leap forward? Is it the result of fearing difficulties and settling for the status quo, or is it the result of going all out and striving for progress? The reader can quickly draw their own conclusions. – Editor

Overcoming the Decades-Long Drought
Henan Reports Bumper Sweet Potato Harvest

According to harvested and projected results, the average yield of Henan Province's 18 million mu of sweet potatoes can reach over 767 jin (grain equivalent) per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

This year, Henan Province suffered an unprecedented drought in decades, but under the leadership of the Party and with the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes, a large-scale anti-drought struggle was launched, overcoming the severe drought. The harvested sweet potatoes have all yielded bumper harvests, and the unharvested ones also promise a good yield. In the Kaifeng area, the 490,000 mu of sweet potatoes already harvested have an average yield of 880 jin (grain equivalent) per mu. In Huaiyang County, the 70,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes already harvested have an average yield of 1,224 jin (grain equivalent) per mu. In six counties including Ningling, Xia邑, and Weishi, the sweet potato yield can exceed 1,000 jin (grain equivalent) per mu. Various places have also seen many high-yield plots and fields with yields of over 10,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes per mu.

The sweet potato harvesting season is approaching. Various places have mobilized the masses to summarize the experiences and lessons of last year, and have made specific arrangements for the harvesting, storage, and processing of sweet potatoes. They require that while planting wheat well, a vigorous mass "six-good" movement of sweet potatoes be quickly launched: "harvest well, store well, plant and preserve seeds well, slice and dry well, comprehensively utilize well, and eat well," ensuring that "not a piece is lost, not a piece rots, not a slice molds, and not a single sweet potato leaf or vine is thrown away," so that the bumper sweet potatoes already in hand are harvested, managed, and utilized well.

### 抗过几十年未有的大旱  河南红薯喜报丰收

    大家从报纸上已经看到，今年河南干旱程度是几十年没见过的，干旱时间超过了1942年。那年，河南赤地千里，三百万人丧失生命，千家百户卖儿鬻女。今年，河南人民却夺得一亿一千万亩秋作物的大丰收。晋北，这土地贫瘠，风沙霜冻为害的低产区，现在，不仅粮食生产显著增长，油料也自给有余；气温低、日照短，一向仰赖南方供应蔬菜的哈尔滨市，今年一季秋菜就足够全市人民吃八个月。这是小变化还是大变化？是小跃进还是大跃进？是害怕困难、安居下游的结果，还是鼓足干劲、力争上游的结果？想来读者是可以迅速得出自己的答案的。　——编　者
    抗过几十年未有的大旱
    河南红薯喜报丰收
    河南省一千八百万亩红薯，根据已经收获和预测的结果，平均单产可达七百六十七斤（折粮）以上，比大跃进的1958年增产四成多。
    今年河南省遭受了几十年来未有的大旱，但是在党的领导下，人民公社发挥了无比优越性，开展了规模巨大的抗旱斗争，战胜了特大干旱，已收的红薯都获得了大丰收，未收的也丰收在望。开封专区已收的四十九万亩红薯，平均单产八百八十斤（折粮）。淮阳县已收的七万亩春红薯，平均单产一千二百二十四斤（折粮）。宁陵、夏邑、尉氏等六个县，红薯单产都可超过千斤以上（折粮）。各地还出现很多亩产鲜红薯万斤以上的丰产方、丰产田。
    目前红薯大收季节快要到来，各地都发动群众总结去年的经验教训，对红薯的收、藏、加工作了具体部署，要求在种好小麦的同时，迅速掀起一个声势浩大的群众性的“收好、藏好、种留好、切片晒干好、综合利用好、吃好”的红薯“六好”运动，保证做到“一块不丢、一块不烂、一片不霉、一个红薯叶和秧不扔”，把已经拿到手的丰产红薯收好管好用好。
