　　Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    Resolution on Supporting the Soviet Government's Proposal for Complete and Thorough Disarmament
    Adopted at the Tenth Session of the Second National People's Congress Standing Committee on October 14, 1959

　　The Soviet government issued a declaration on the disarmament issue on September 18, 1959, and simultaneously put forward a new proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. This proposal by the Soviet government opens up a new and bright path for practically solving the disarmament issue that the vast number of people around the world are most concerned about, thereby greatly encouraging and enhancing the confidence of the world's people in safeguarding peace. This is another major contribution by the Soviet government to easing international tensions, eliminating the scourge of war, and defending world peace. It is quite natural that this peace initiative immediately won the warm welcome and widespread support of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

　　The people of the world clearly see that the Soviet government, which has steadfastly pursued a foreign policy of peace, has consistently made unremitting efforts to defend human peace, oppose wars of aggression, and achieve universal disarmament since its establishment. Especially since the end of World War II, the Soviet government has used various opportunities to put forward a series of peace initiatives regarding the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction, and the dismantling of military bases in foreign countries in order to ease international tensions. At the same time, it has also taken its own actions to promote the resolution of these issues. The Soviet government has repeatedly and substantially reduced its own armed forces, greatly reduced military expenditures, and once unilaterally suspended nuclear weapons testing. All of this fully demonstrates the sincerity of the Soviet government and the Soviet people in achieving universal disarmament and maintaining world peace.

　　However, the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States has consistently pursued a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and has done everything possible to obstruct and undermine the Soviet Union's peaceful disarmament proposals. Even whenever the Soviet Union proactively puts forward constructive proposals on the issue of disarmament, the Western countries headed by the United States retreat from their original positions. The fact is very clear that it is only due to the unreasonable obstruction and sabotage of the American aggressive bloc that the disarmament issue, which the people of the world are so concerned about, has not been resolved to this day. The warmongering group in the United States is once again maliciously distorting and attacking the new and reasonable proposal put forward by the Soviet government this time. It must be pointed out that if the ruling group in the United States continues to unreasonably refuse to reach any agreement on the issue of disarmament, it will once again expose its anti-people and anti-peace face, and at the same time, it will not be able to escape the serious responsibility of exacerbating the Cold War and obstructing the easing of international tensions in front of the people of the world.

　　The government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people have always unswervingly followed a foreign policy of peace, made every effort to safeguard peace and oppose aggression, and have consistently advocated universal disarmament, the dismantling of military bases in foreign countries, and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China fully supports the declaration and specific proposals on complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government on September 18, 1959, and believes that this new proposal fully conforms to the urgent wishes and fundamental interests of the people of all countries in the world. Its realization will fundamentally change the entire international situation, thereby establishing a reliable guarantee for world peace. The government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people will continue to work with the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples to do everything in their power to strive for the realization of complete and thorough disarmament.

　　全国人民代表大会常务委员会
    关于支持苏联政府全面彻底裁军建议的决议
    一九五九年十月十四日第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十次会议通过
    苏联政府在1959年9月18日发表了一项关于裁军问题的宣言，同时提出关于全面彻底裁军的新建议。苏联政府的这个建议为实际解决目前全世界广大人民最迫切关心的裁军问题开辟了一条新的、光明的道路，从而大大鼓舞和增强了世界人民维护和平的信心。这是苏联政府为和缓国际紧张局势、消除战争灾害、保卫世界和平的又一次重大贡献。十分自然，这个和平倡议立即赢得一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和普遍支持。
    全世界人民清楚地看到，坚持不渝地执行和平外交政策的苏联政府，从它成立的第一天开始就一贯为捍卫人类和平、反对侵略战争和实现普遍裁军进行不懈的努力。特别是自从第二次世界大战结束以来，苏联政府为了缓和国际紧张局势，曾经利用各种机会提出一系列关于裁减军备、禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器、撤消在外国的军事基地等和平倡议，同时还以自己的行动来促进这些问题的解决。苏联政府一再大量裁减自己的武装部队，大大削减军事开支，并且一度单方面停止核武器的试验。这一切充分说明苏联政府和苏联人民对实现普遍裁军、维护世界和平的诚意。
    但是，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团却一贯执行扩军备战的政策，并且对于苏联的和平裁军建议千方百计地加以阻挠和破坏。甚至每当苏联主动地就裁军问题提出建设性建议的时候，以美国为首的西方国家就从他们原来的立场上后退。事实很明显，只是由于美国侵略集团的无理阻挠和破坏，才使得全世界人民迫切关心的裁军问题一直到现在还没有得到解决。对于苏联政府这次提出的新的合理建议，美国好战集团又在进行恶意的歪曲和攻击。必须指出，美国统治集团如果仍然继续无理拒绝就裁军问题达成任何协议，那就再一次暴露他们反人民、反和平的面目，同时，在全世界人民面前绝不能逃避加剧冷战、阻挠和缓国际紧张局势的严重责任。
    中华人民共和国政府和中国人民始终不渝地遵循着和平的外交政策，全力为维护和平、反对侵略而努力，并且一贯主张普遍裁减军备、撤消在外国的军事基地、永远禁止使用核武器。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会完全支持苏联政府1959年9月18日提出的关于全面彻底裁军的宣言和具体建议，并且认为，这个新的建议完全符合世界各国人民的迫切愿望和根本利益。它的实现将使整个国际局势发生根本的变化，从而为世界和平建立可靠的保证。中华人民共和国政府和中国人民将继续同苏联以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，竭尽全力共同为实现全面彻底的裁军而奋斗。
