　　"The Biggest Victim"
　　Guo Yang, People's Commune of Julu Pingxiang, Hebei
    The Great Leap Forward was a positive action taken by us, the "common people," to rapidly become prosperous and happy! The People's Commune is the newest organization created to adapt to our leap forward! We cheer for the conditions of happiness that the People's Commune has given us, and we are proud of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward.
    Unexpectedly, our positive actions taken for our own happiness and prosperity have caused the American gentlemen to exclaim, saying that "the Chinese people will be the biggest victims of this Great Leap Forward."
    Well then, let's look at the "harm" we have suffered! Not to mention the big and distant things, let's just talk about something personal: in 1957, our production team's average yield per mu was 150 jin, and each work point was worth 4 jiao and 7 fen; while in the leaping 1958 and 1959, it jumped to an average of 380 jin and 420 jin, and each work point was worth 1 yuan 5 jiao and 2 yuan 1 jiao!
    According to what the American gentlemen say, earning 4 jiao and 7 fen is happiness, while earning 1 yuan 5 jiao and 2 yuan 1 jiao is "the biggest harm"! If that's the case, then the American people are truly "happy"!
    Are there really such stupid people who would do things that harm themselves? Alas, unintelligent American official commentators, you've fanned in the wrong direction! Not only have you failed to put out the fire, but you have instead helped to fuel it!
    Let those American parasites howl! Anyway, smart people all know: the more fiercely they shout, the more it proves that the Chinese people are happier and more prosperous!

### “最大受害者”

　　“最大受害者”
　　河北巨鹿平乡人民公社　郭暘
    大跃进是我们“老百姓”为了迅速富强、幸福起来的积极行动，人民公社是为了适应我们的跃进而产生的最新组织！我们为人民公社所给我们的幸福条件而欢呼，为大跃进的成就而骄傲。
    想不到我们为了自己的幸福和富强所采取的积极行动，却引起了美国老爷们的惊叫，说什么“中国的老百姓将是这个大跃进的最大受害者”。
    那么，请看我们受的“害”吧！大的、远的不说，就说切身的一件吧：1957年我们生产队平均亩产量是一百五十斤，每个工合四角七分；而跃进的1958年、1959年就一下子平均到三百八十斤、四百二十斤，每个工合一元五角、二元一角！
    要按美国老爷们的话来说，那就是：收入四角七分是幸福，而收入一元五角、二元一角则是“最大受害”！如此来说，那美国的老百姓倒真是“幸福”极了！
    真有那样的蠢人去干伤害他自己的事吗？哎呀，不聪明的美国官方评论家们，你们这一扇子搧错了！不但没有把火搧灭，反而有助火之势呢！
    让那些美国的蠹虫们嚎叫去吧！反正聪明的人都知道：他们愈是喊叫的厉害，那就证明中国的老百姓愈幸福、愈富强！
