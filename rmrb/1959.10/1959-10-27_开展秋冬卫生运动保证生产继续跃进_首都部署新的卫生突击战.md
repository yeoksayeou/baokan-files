Xinhua News Agency, October 26th – An autumn and winter patriotic health campaign has begun in the capital. More than 4,000 representatives from advanced health units and advanced health areas gathered on the 25th and expressed their determination to continue to exert their efforts and do a good job in pest elimination and disease prevention in the fourth quarter of this year, to ensure a great leap forward on the industrial and agricultural production fronts. At the meeting, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee awarded 357 advanced health red banner units in the city. Before the meeting, various districts had also successively rewarded district-level advanced health red banner units. The four urban districts alone had 892 district-level advanced red banner units.

The meeting was presided over by Gu De, Deputy Director of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Cui Yueli, Minister of the Health and Sports Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the meeting.

According to the laws of disease occurrence and the living habits of the "four pests," the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee decided to launch three health blitz campaigns in the fourth quarter. The first, from October 27th to 31st, will be a health blitz campaign centered on rat extermination. Vigorously eliminate house rats, sewer rats, and field rats, eliminate remaining mosquitoes and flies, and conduct publicity and inspection on the prevention of gas poisoning. The specific requirements and steps are: First, in terms of a blitz on rat extermination, the first step is from October 27th to 29th for three days. In the urban area, universally cut off rat food and water. Adopt a combination of beating and drug poisoning methods, put down poison bait, and eliminate house rats. On the afternoon of the 29th, all rat holes will be blocked to prevent the rats from running back. The second step, starting on the 30th, use sulfur smoke to fumigate sewer rats. In suburban areas, from October 27th to 31st, in conjunction with the autumn harvest and grain protection, mobilize the masses to take comprehensive measures such as poisoning, beating, and blocking to eliminate house rats. At the same time, in conjunction with the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn planting, autumn plowing), take measures such as turning over stacks, digging holes, and irrigating water to vigorously eliminate field rats. Second, in terms of eliminating remaining mosquitoes and flies, according to the situation that mosquitoes and flies are moving from outdoors to indoors or warm, sunny places to hide, and that it is now the season when the breeding capacity of mosquitoes and flies is very small, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee requires the people of the city to seize the opportunity to actively swat them. Strengthen control and treatment of mosquito and fly breeding sites. In the fourth quarter, rural areas should combine manure accumulation and fertilizer production, improve the organization of the year-round manure accumulation team, appropriately improve the management of manure pits (ponds) and toilets, and conscientiously do a good job in mud sealing and composting. Do a good job in the hygiene of collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly. Third, prevent gas poisoning.

The second health blitz campaign will start in November, launching a health campaign centered on the prevention and control of winter infectious diseases. In December, the third health blitz campaign will be launched, mobilizing the people of the city to use a combination of poisoning and beating to eliminate sparrows, overwintering mosquitoes and flies, and to carry out a major cleaning before the New Year.

In the past ten months of this year, the people of the capital have launched a total of nine health blitz campaigns. In August and September, under the slogan of "Mobilize the whole people to completely eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day cleanly," four blitz campaigns were carried out, setting off a mass patriotic health campaign upsurge. The city's sanitation has been greatly improved, and the incidence of disease has decreased significantly compared with last year, effectively ensuring the continued great leap forward on the production front.

    开展秋冬卫生运动保证生产继续跃进
    首都部署新的卫生突击战
    新华社26日讯　秋冬季爱国卫生运动在首都开始了。四千多名卫生先进单位和卫生先进地区的代表25日集会表示：决心继续鼓足干劲，做好今年第四季度除害灭病工作，保证工农业生产战线上的大跃进。会上，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会奖励了三百五十七个全市卫生先进红旗单位。会前各区也曾先后奖励了区级的卫生先进红旗单位，仅城区四个区的区级先进红旗单位就有八百九十二个。
    会议由北京市爱国卫生运动委员会副主任顾德主持。北京市副市长王昆仑、中共北京市委卫生体育部部长崔月犁都在会上讲了话。
    北京市爱国卫生运动委员会，根据疾病发生规律和四害生活习性，决定在第四季度开展三次卫生突击运动。第一次从10月27日到31日，开展一次以灭鼠为中心的卫生突击运动。大力扑灭家鼠、沟鼠、田鼠，消灭残存蚊蝇，并进行预防煤气中毒的宣传和检查。具体的要求和步骤是：第一、在突击灭鼠方面，第一步是从10月27日到29日三天中，在城区普遍做到断绝鼠粮和鼠的饮水，采取扑打和药物毒杀相结合的方法，投放毒饵，消灭家鼠。29日下午将全部鼠洞堵塞，不让老鼠回窜。第二步在30日开始用硫磺烟熏沟鼠。郊区27日到31日结合秋收保粮发动群众采取毒、打、堵等综合措施消灭家鼠。同时结合三秋采取翻垛、挖洞、灌水等办法大力消灭田鼠。第二、在消灭残存蚊蝇方面，根据蚊蝇由室外转入室内或温暖向阳地方躲藏的情况，和现在又正是蚊蝇繁殖力很小的季节，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会要求全市人民抓紧时机积极扑打。对蚊蝇孳生的场所，加强控制和处理。农村在第四季度里，结合积肥、造肥、健全全年积肥队的组织，适当地改善粪池（坑）和厕所的管理，认真作好泥封堆肥。作好食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业的卫生工作。第三、预防煤气中毒。
    第二次卫生突击运动将从11月份起，展开以防治冬季传染病为中心的卫生运动。12月份将开展第三次卫生突击运动，发动全市人民用毒杀和扑打相结合的办法，消灭麻雀、过冬蚊蝇和进行新年前的大扫除。
    首都人民今年十个月来，共开展了九次卫生突击运动。8、9两月在“全民动员起来，彻底消灭蚊蝇，干干净净迎接国庆十周年”的口号下，作了四次突击运动，掀起了群众性的爱国卫生运动高潮。全市的卫生面貌大大改观，发病率比去年显著下降，有力地保证了生产战线上的继续大跃进。
