Building an Enterprise
He Beiren

Recently, I took a trip to the northern countryside. In a famous people's commune, I not only saw the high tide of the rural mass movement, rolling like ocean waves, but also the future of the new socialist countryside. The commune's land has all been transformed into high-grade garden plots. The earth is just as the poets describe, "like brocade and embroidery." During the wheat planting season, tractors roared and raced across the fields all day long. Now, tens of miles are covered in a sea of verdant wheat seedlings. Traveling along the roads between the fields, one can constantly see the engine rooms of the machine wells standing majestically. These are like the heart chambers of the earth, with the portable steam engines thumping inside, and the clear water flows into the fields like white blood.

The degree of mechanization in this commune is so high: it has twenty-six tractors, sixteen combine harvesters, nine threshing machines, and more than four hundred other large and small machines. There are over three hundred machine wells and more than two hundred sets of irrigation and drainage machinery. Almost all of the commune's land is cultivated by tractors. Water irrigation is also fully mechanized. From October of last year to August of this year, there was no significant rainfall for ten months, but neither the summer nor autumn fields lacked water. People say, "We irrigated the summer crops to maturity and the autumn crops to maturity; this is unprecedented since the beginning of time." The commune's large plots of high-yield wheat averaged over 800 jin per mu. All the harvested wheat is threshed by threshing machines and combine harvesters. The people here happily tell jokes. They say: In the past, we used "the stone roller doesn't turn" to describe "a great famine year." This year, we will use "the stone roller doesn't turn" to describe a great harvest.

People around them admire and praise their excellent production conditions. These conditions are indeed very good, and no one can help but rejoice and be excited by them. However, what inspired me deeply was how they achieved this state.

Speaking of which, it is even more admirable. Naturally, because the people here have made outstanding achievements, they have also received special attention from the Party and the state. Therefore, the state has provided them with more assistance in terms of mechanization. However, this is not the main reason. The main reason is that the people here are striving for self-improvement and have a strong spirit of "building an enterprise."

Take the drilling of wells and the addition of irrigation machinery, for example. There is a touching history here: From the winter of 1955, a mass movement for drilling wells began here; in 1956, large-scale water conservancy construction was carried out. However, that year encountered an unprecedented flood. Eighty percent of the land was affected, and villages and houses were destroyed. Some wells were also submerged. However, in 1957, they continued to work hard. That year, they harvested an average of more than 300 jin of grain per mu, which was considered a good harvest. After the autumn harvest, two opinions emerged among cadres and the masses. Some people already felt satisfied, "We have never harvested so much grain in previous years!" They advocated that since the masses had suffered in the past two years and the harvest was good this year, everyone should get a larger share and eat better. These people were not actively expanding accumulation and developing production, but were instead eager to improve their lives and purchase non-essential items. They also advocated that the existing machine wells were enough and that fewer should be built in the future and the pace slowed down. They believed that building more would be a "waste of manpower and resources." Some advocated that if more were to be built, the state should provide more loans, and some even sent representatives to the county Party committee to request loans.

The above views were opposed by another group of people. These people advocated "even greater efforts." The reason was that the existing machinery and wells could not guarantee a safe passage through drought years, and that with a good harvest this year, they should strike while the iron was hot. With capital in hand, they should continue to make great efforts. They said: "Drilling wells to extract water is not only for increasing production in the present, but also for providing benefits to future generations; it is a hundred-year undertaking." They advocated: "To build an enterprise, first get to the root; to have a good harvest, first get water. We would rather eat less and eat worse, but first we must build the machine wells." They advocated: "The money should come from ourselves, and the work should be done by ourselves. If each labor day is distributed one or two jiao less, the money will be there; we have plenty of strength, and if we don't have the skills, we will learn." Under the leadership of the Party, a debate was launched among cadres and the masses. As a result of the debate, the vast majority favored "building an enterprise." Many people actively invested and donated materials. Some took out the money they had saved for marriage, and some donated the wood they had prepared for building houses and even the coffin boards they had prepared for their funerals. The "building an enterprise" faction achieved a complete victory, and mechanization of well construction was realized. In 1958, the yield of grain per mu increased to 406 jin, and in 1959, the yield of grain per mu increased even further to 800 jin. To this day, when people talk about the characteristics of the people here, there is always one, which is a strong "enterprise-building ideology."

The "enterprise-building ideology" is what we usually call "the enthusiasm for building socialism." If we regard transforming the land into garden plots and mechanizing cultivation and irrigation as an agricultural revolution, then the "enterprise-building ideology" is the dedication to the revolutionary cause. This is the treasure of treasures, worthy of cherishing and promoting. The development of new undertakings in this commune shows that agricultural mechanization is the most important and reliable measure for increasing production (which, of course, cannot be solved in isolation), and that the realization of agricultural mechanization mainly depends on agricultural builders accumulating funds through frugality. While continuously developing production, we should naturally pay attention to continuously improving people's lives, but we must also constantly promote the spirit of "building an enterprise" in order to continuously increase production and improve working conditions even more. This year, compared to last year, our whole country is having an even greater harvest. Next year, the major task of gradually mechanizing agriculture will be before us. While celebrating our harvest and the improvement of our lives, let us learn even better from the "enterprise-building" spirit of this heroic commune!

    治业
    何北仁
    最近，我到北方的农村走了一趟，在一个著名的人民公社里，我不仅看到了滚滚如海浪的农村群众运动的高潮，而且，看到了祖国新农村的未来。这个公社的土地全部高级园田化了。大地正像诗人们所形容的，“如锦似绣”。在种麦的那当儿，拖拉机整日在田野上咆哮奔驰。如今，几十里地内已是一片绿茸茸麦苗的海洋。穿行在田间的公路上，可以不断看到雄踞在田间的机井房，这像是大地的心房，锅驼机在它里面哒哒地转动，清清的流水，像白色的血液灌进田垅里去。
    这个公社机械化的程度是这样的高：有二十六台拖拉机，十六台康拜因机，九台脱谷机，和四百多台其它大小机械。机井有三百多眼，排灌机械二百多台。这个公社的土地差不多全部都用拖拉机耕种。水利灌溉也全部机械化了。从去年10月到今年8月，十个月没有下过透雨，但是夏田和秋田都没有缺水。人们说：“浇熟了夏也浇熟了秋，这是开天辟地以来没有的事”。这个公社大片丰产方里的麦子，每亩地平均产量八百多斤。丰收的麦子全部用脱谷机和康拜因机脱粒。这里的人们高兴地说着俏皮话。他们说：过去我们用“碌碡不翻身”形容“大荒年”，今年我们要用“碌碡不翻身”形容大丰收。
    周围的人们，都羡慕和赞扬他们优异的生产条件。这条件的确很好，没有人不为他们的这些条件而庆幸和兴奋。但是，使我深受启发的，却是他们怎样才达到了这一地步。
    说来，更是使人无限敬佩。自然，由于这里的人民作出了优异的成绩，也受到了党和国家的特别重视，因此国家在机械化方面给予他们的援助比较多一些。但是，这并不是主要的。主要的原因是这里的人民发奋自强，有坚强的“治业”精神。
    就拿打机井和添置灌溉机械来说，这里有过这样一段动人的历史：从1955年冬天起，这里就开始了打机井的群众运动；1956年又大搞水利建设。但是，这一年遇到了空前的大水灾。80％的土地遭灾，村庄和房屋被毁。有些井也被淹没了。但是，1957年他们接着大干。这一年每亩地平均收了三百多斤粮食，算是一个丰收。秋收以后，在干部和群众中，出现了两种意见。一种人已经感到满足了，“往年从来没有收过这么多粮啊！”他们主张，这两年群众生活苦，今年丰收了，应该让大家多分些，吃好些。这些人不积极扩大积累，发展生产，而是去急着改善生活，购置并不急需的用品。他们还主张：现有的机井不少了，以后少搞点，搞慢点。认为再多搞就是“劳民伤财”。他们有的主张：要多搞也行，但要国家多贷款，有的还派代表到县委会去请求贷款。
    以上这种主张，遭到了另一种人的反对。这种人主张“还要大搞”。道理是现有的机械设备和水井，还不能保证平安度过旱年，今年丰收了，更应该趁热打铁。手里有了本钱，更应该接着大搞了。他们说：“钻井取水，这不仅是眼前增产，而且是为后代儿孙置福哩，是百年大业。”他们主张：“治业先治本，丰收先取水。宁愿少吃点，吃次点，也要先把机井打成。”他们主张：“钱由自己出，事由自己办。一个劳动日少分一两角，钱就有了；力气身上有的是，没有本事就去学。”在党的领导下，在干部和群众当中展开了一场辩论。辩论的结果，赞成“治业”的人是绝大多数。有不少人，积极投资，献料，有的把结婚的钱先拿出来，有的把盖房的木料，准备善后的棺材板也献出来了。“治业”派取得了彻底胜利，机井化得到了实现。1958年每亩粮食的产量增加到四百零六斤，1959年，每亩地粮食的产量更增加到八百斤。至今，有人一谈论起这里人民的特点来，总还有一条，叫作“治业思想”强。
    “治业”思想，就是我们通常所说的“建设社会主义的积极性”。如果把土地园田化，耕作和灌溉机械化看成是一种耕作上的革命，那末，“治业”思想，就是革命的事业心。这是宝中之宝，值得珍视和发扬的。这个公社新事业的发展说明，农业机械化是增加产量的最主要最可靠的措施（这当然不能孤立地去解决），而农业机械化的实现，主要又要靠农业建设者节衣缩食积累资金。在不断发展生产条件下，自然应该重视不断地改善人民生活，但我们更要不断发扬“治业”精神，以求不断地更多增加生产和改善劳动的条件。今年，比之去年，我们全国又是一个更大的丰收；明年，农业逐步机械化的重大任务又摆在我们眼前。让我们在庆幸我们的丰收和生活改善的时候，更好地向这个英雄公社的“治业”精神学习吧！
