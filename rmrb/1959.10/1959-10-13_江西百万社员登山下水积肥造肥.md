　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 12th -- In Jiangxi Province, over a million commune members are climbing mountains and going into the water, extensively opening up fertilizer sources to make fertilizer in a rush for winter planting and next year's production. According to recent statistics, the province has already accumulated and created over ten billion dan of various fertilizers, averaging more than thirty dan of fertilizer per mu based on the planned area for winter planting. This intensive fertilizer accumulation campaign began in mid-September. The period of approximately one and a half months from mid-September to the busy autumn harvest and winter planting is a good time to accumulate and create fertilizer because there is less agricultural work, the mountains are green, and lake grasses are lush, providing abundant sources of fertilizer. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities have drawn about 20% of their labor force and, led by the secretaries of Party committees at all levels, have launched an intensive fertilizer accumulation and creation campaign.

　　Various localities have adopted a variety of methods according to local conditions, such as cutting on mountains, shoveling on flat ground, scooping in water, burning in fields, sweeping indoors, and picking in the wild, to extensively open up sources of fertilizer. In the eleven counties of the Ji'an Special District, a great competition of fertilizer accumulation and creation was launched, comparing work efficiency, quantity, and quality, with more than 260,000 commune members, led by secretaries of Party committees at all levels, going up mountains and into the water to cut green manure, shovel grass, and burn ash to make fertilizer. In the Shangrao Special District, counties implemented a responsibility system assigning fertilizer accumulation tasks to teams and individuals, specifying the time, quantity, quality, and work points, with an average daily accumulation and creation of more than four million dan of fertilizer. Counties bordering Poyang Lake, such as Boyang, Yujiang, and Yugan, organized hundreds of water-based fertilizer accumulation expedition teams to extensively harvest lake grass. In Xingguo County of the Gannan Administrative Region, each commune organized four hundred and seventy-six shock brigades for burning soil fertilizer, composed of more than 40,000 young commune members, to shovel sod and burn soil fertilizer on the mountains.

　　In the fertilizer accumulation and creation campaign, various localities promoted the method of digging cellars for composting fertilizer and building sheds to preserve fertilizer, in order to improve the quality of fertilizer.

　　江西百万社员登山下水积肥造肥
    据新华社南昌12日电　江西省各地有一百多万社员正在登山下水，广开肥源，为冬种和明年生产突击积肥造肥。据最近统计，全省已积造各种肥料十亿多担，按冬种计划面积计算，平均每亩已有肥三十多担。这次突击积肥运动是从9月中旬开始的。9月中旬到秋收冬种大忙以前约一个半月时间，农活较少，山青湖草茂盛，肥源广阔，是积肥造肥的大好时机。各地根据省委的指示，抽调了20％左右的劳力，由各级党委书记挂帅掀起了突击积肥造肥运动。
    各地因地制宜，采取了山上割、平地铲、水里捞、地里烧、屋内扫、野外拣等多种办法，广开肥源。吉安专区十一个县，开展了比工效、比数量、比质量的积肥造肥大竞赛，每天有二十六万多社员在各级党委书记率领下，上山下水，打青铲草，烧灰堆肥。上饶专区各县实行积肥任务到队、到人，定时、定量、定质、定工分的责任制，每天平均积肥造肥四百多万担。鄱阳湖滨的波阳、余江、余干等县，组织了成百上千个水上积肥远征队，大捞湖草。赣南行政区的兴国县各公社，由四万多名青年社员组成的四百七十六个烧土肥的突击队，在山上铲草皮烧土肥。
    各地在积肥造肥运动中推行了挖窖沤肥、搭棚保肥的办法，以提高肥料的质量。
