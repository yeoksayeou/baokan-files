Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The First Ministry of Machine Building has presented two major combat tasks for the fourth quarter to the workers on the national machinery industry front: to complete and overfulfill this year’s Great Leap Forward plan for the machinery industry half a month or even earlier; and to prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward in the machinery industry next year.

Thanks to opposing rightism and encouraging vigor, and launching an increase production and practice economy movement, the national machinery industry has seen an excellent situation. By the end of September, the total output value of the national machinery industry had completed 77% of the annual plan, 4.6% more than the total output value of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; the output of major products had also mostly completed more than three-quarters of the annual plan. Based on this situation, the First Ministry of Machine Building called on the nation's machinery industry workers to continue to boost their energy, advance victoriously, and strive to complete the annual plan and the tasks stipulated in the ordering contracts half a month or even earlier, and to strive to increase the production of machinery and equipment urgently needed by the country currently or next year. To this end, the First Ministry of Machine Building has put forward new production increase targets, stipulating that this year's total output value should increase by more than 10% over the original plan, and that heavy machinery power station equipment, motors, bearings, transformers and other urgently needed important products of the country should all be increased in production.

The First Ministry of Machine Building pointed out that the completion of the annual plan and the production increase plan would enable more, better, and earlier provision of machinery and equipment to the various sectors of the national economy needed for this year's Great Leap Forward and next year's continued Great Leap Forward. This is not only an economic task, but also a major political task for the nation's machinery industry workers.

The key to completing the above tasks lies in continuing to deeply develop the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. To this end, the First Ministry of Machine Building proposed: First, we must resolutely put politics in command, continue to boldly mobilize the masses, and launch socialist labor competitions. The recent upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy on the machinery industry front once again proves that only by putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, and launching various forms of socialist labor competitions can the Great Leap Forward be realized. On October 6th, all the workers in the Shanghai machinery industry put forward a competition proposal to the national machinery industry workers to complete the annual plan half a month to a month ahead of schedule and to "not let the contract pass the New Year" (that is, to ensure the completion of the delivery tasks stipulated in the contract before the New Year). The First Ministry of Machine Building called on the workers of all machinery enterprises in the country to actively respond to this proposal. Second, vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and combine hard work with smart work. This is an important condition for consolidating and continuing the development of the current upsurge of the mass movement. The First Ministry of Machine Building has already put forward the key points and measures for technological innovation and technological revolution in response to the weak links in the current production. Third, continue to achieve an all-round leap forward in high output, good quality, low consumption, and low cost. Every enterprise must formulate a plan for an all-round leap forward in the fourth quarter, and submit the various indicators of the plan to the masses for discussion. Fourth, pay attention to combining safety with production, and combining work with rest.

The First Ministry of Machine Building also requires the comprehensive strengthening of enterprise management in the large-scale mass movement.

In order to prepare for next year's Great Leap Forward in the machinery industry and to avoid the phenomenon of production at the beginning of each year being lower than the level at the end of the previous year, the First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to first issue a portion of the tasks in next year's plan to various regions and enterprises in mid-October; the materials needed for next year's production will also be striven to be allocated as early as October this year. Regarding the technical preparation work for next year's production, local enterprises should mainly seize the preparation for the trial production of new products early, the preparation for the batch production of finalized products, the design of product drawings and the preparation of process documents, the overhaul of machinery and equipment, and the storage of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and raw materials. On the basis of studying and implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the various units should also comprehensively and systematically summarize the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 in the fourth quarter, and take it as one of the important preparation work contents for realizing next year's Great Leap Forward.

The First Ministry of Machine Building convened a telephone conference on October 6th with the participation of the directors of the mechanical industry departments and bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and the responsible cadres of key enterprises, to deploy the above work. Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo participated in this meeting and delivered a speech.

    一机部提出第四季度两大战斗任务
    保证提前完成全年计划
    抓紧时间为明年大跃进作好准备
    新华社8日讯　第一机械工业部向全国机械工业战线的职工提出了第四季度的两大战斗任务：提前半个月或者更早一些时间，完成和超额完成今年机械工业大跃进的计划；并且为明年机械工业继续大跃进作好准备。
    由于反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动，全国机械工业出现了大好的局面。到9月底止，全国机械工业总产值已经完成全年计划77％，比大跃进的1958年全年总产值还多4.6％；主要产品的产量也大都完成了全年计划的四分之三以上。根据这种情况，第一机械工业部号召全国机械工业职工继续鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，争取提前半个月或者更早一些时间完成全年计划和订货合同规定的任务，并且力求增产国家当前或明年急需的机械设备。第一机械工业部为此已提出了新的增产目标，规定今年的总产值要比原计划增加10％以上，重型机械电站设备、电动机、轴承和变压器等国家急需的重要产品都要增产。
    第一机械工业部指出，完成了全年的计划和增产计划，就可以更多更好更早地向国民经济各部门提供今年大跃进和明年继续大跃进所需的机械设备。这不仅是一项经济任务，而且也是全国机械工业职工的一项重大的政治任务。
    完成上述任务的关键，在于继续深入地开展增产节约群众运动。为此，第一机械工业部提出：第一，必须坚决政治挂帅，继续放手发动群众，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。最近机械工业战线上出现的增产节约运动高潮，再一次证明，只有政治挂帅、放手发动群众和开展各种形式的社会主义劳动竞赛，才能实现大跃进。10月6日，上海机械工业全体职工向全国机械工业职工提出了提前半个月到一个月完成全年计划和“不让合同过年”（即保证在年前完成合同规定的交货任务）的竞赛倡议。第一机械工业部号召全国各机械企业的职工积极响应这一倡议。第二，大闹技术革新和技术革命，把苦干和巧干结合起来。这是当前群众运动高潮巩固和继续发展的重要条件。第一机械工业部已经针对当前生产中的薄弱环节，提出了技术革新和技术革命的重点和措施。第三，继续实现产量高、质量好、低消耗、低成本的全面跃进。每个企业都要订出第四季度全面跃进的计划，并且把计划的各种指标交给群众讨论。第四，注意使安全和生产结合，劳和逸结合。
    第一机械工业部还要求在大规模的群众运动中，全面地加强企业的管理工作。
    为了给明年机械工业大跃进作好准备，避免发生历年年初生产低于上年年末水平的现象，第一机械工业部已经决定在10月中旬先把明年计划中的一部分任务，下达到各地区和各企业；明年生产所需要的材料也力争提早在今年10月份开始分配。关于明年的生产技术准备工作，各地企业主要应早抓新产品试制的准备，定型产品成批投入生产的准备，产品图纸的设计和工艺文件的编制，机器设备的检修，以及在制品、半成品和原料材料的储备等。各单位在学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议的基础上，第四季度还要全面系统地总结1958年和1959年大跃进的丰富经验，并且把它作为实现明年大跃进的重要准备工作内容之一。
    第一机械工业部在10月6日召开了有各省、市、自治区机械工业厅局长和各重点企业负责干部参加的电话会议，部署了上述工作。国务院副总理薄一波参加了这次会议，并且讲了话。
