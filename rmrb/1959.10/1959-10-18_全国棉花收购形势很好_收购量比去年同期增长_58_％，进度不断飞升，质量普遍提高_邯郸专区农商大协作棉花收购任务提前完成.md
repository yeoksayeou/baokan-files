Xinhua News Agency, 17th: A strong momentum, large scale, rapid progress, and good quality are the biggest characteristics of this year's new cotton purchasing campaign. Currently, a vigorous and solid new cotton purchasing campaign has formed a climax nationwide. As of October 14th, the national cotton purchase volume increased by 58% compared to the same period last year. Provinces and regions such as Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Shanxi, and Xinjiang have more than doubled their purchases compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of new cotton purchasing in early September in various regions, the purchasing volume has increased every ten days. In early September, the national daily average purchase of new cotton was 130,000 dan (a unit of weight), which rose to 250,000 dan in mid-September, and further rose to 450,000 dan in late September. After the National Day holiday, from October 6th to 10th, the daily average purchase volume further rose to 550,000 dan, and on October 10th, 980,000 dan were purchased in a single day, setting a historical record for daily purchase volume. Not only is the speed of purchase and storage fast, and the quantity large, but the quality of new cotton has also generally improved. According to reports from various regions, the quality of cotton purchased this year is generally one grade higher than last year. A large amount of good quality third and fourth grade cotton has appeared, and very little cotton is below sixth grade (cotton quality is divided into twelve grades). In Zhangtai Commune, Nangong County, Hebei Province, the top-quality second and third grade cotton accounted for 98.8% of the total stored.

The significant achievements in this year's cotton purchase work are mainly due to the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels, the resolute implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, anti-rightist sentiments, boosting morale, and launching a vigorous mass movement, while also carrying out meticulous and solid organizational work, thus the development of the movement is extremely healthy. When picking new cotton, various regions have generally mobilized the masses to do a good job of "four separations" (namely, separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, and separate selling), and promoted advanced methods such as "three-pocket cotton picking" or "double-pocket cotton picking," effectively improving the quality of cotton. In order to achieve simultaneous picking, purchasing, processing, and transfer, Party committees in various regions have made meticulous arrangements in terms of short-distance transportation and processing capacity, ensuring that each link is tightly connected and completed in one go.

Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 17th: In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, a famous cotton-producing area, the speed and quality of cotton picking and selling in the cotton purchasing work exceeded any previous year due to the development of a mass movement of agricultural and commercial collaboration centered on cotton picking and selling. As of the 15th, the entire prefecture had completed the annual cotton purchasing task ahead of schedule.

The prefecture's more than five million mu of cotton fields are in full bloom in October, and the entire cotton area is a sea of ​​silver. Since October 8th, more than two million male and female commune members have been involved in the cotton picking and selling movement, with an average daily purchase of more than 50 million jin of seed cotton. As of the 15th, the seed cotton purchased and processed in the entire prefecture had increased by more than six times compared to the same period last year. The entire prefecture completed this year's annual cotton purchase task six months earlier than last year. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the members of the entire prefecture to continue to leap forward on the basis of completing this year's cotton purchase task and further overfulfill the annual purchase task.

The agricultural and commercial collaboration carried out in Handan Prefecture in cotton purchasing is centered on organizing communes and production teams to pick finely, pick quickly and transport quickly, through the close cooperation and mutual support of picking and purchasing, machine processing and folk manpower ginning, cotton picking and selling and the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing) production, short-distance transportation and special transportation, linking production, purchasing, transportation, and processing together like a chain, so as to solve the contradictions between cotton picking and selling, purchasing, processing and outward transfer, and the "three autumns" production and purchasing, greatly accelerating the progress of cotton purchasing work and ensuring the "three autumns" production.

Strengthening the unified leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command is the basic guarantee for Handan Prefecture to organize mass agricultural and commercial collaboration in cotton purchasing. As early as the end of August, the county Party committees combined the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and used the method of mass airing of views, big debates, and big character posters to criticize various forms of departmentalism and fear of difficulties, and established a unified thinking. Communes and production teams generally convened forums attended by cotton picking experts, cotton picking professional teams, and experienced farmers, using specific accounting methods to explain the benefits of early and fast picking and the promotion of "four separations" (separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, and separate transportation) to improve cotton grades. Due to the improvement of cotton grades, commune members increased their income by more than 60 million yuan. While mobilizing commune members to pick quickly, the entire prefecture's 361 cotton purchasing stations also carried out a five-comparison competition focusing on simplifying procedures and improving purchasing efficiency, achieving immediate purchase and no backlog.

Establishing a unified leadership organization and comprehensively and rationally arranging labor is another important reason why Handan Prefecture quickly completed the purchase task. This prefecture, from the prefecture, county, commune, to the production team, has established a joint cotton purchasing command, led by the Party Secretary, to uniformly command and allocate human and animal power. Production teams have organized professional teams for cotton picking, autumn plowing, and wheat sowing according to the size of cotton production and the tasks of "three autumns" production, so that cotton harvesting and the "three autumns" do not interfere with each other. The purchasing departments of various counties also drew thousands of cadres and sent them to the production teams in the cotton areas as liaison officers to help the production teams solve problems in the purchase. The counties also conscientiously implemented the principle of distribution according to work, implemented the distribution method of piece-rate wages and processing rewards, and generally paid attention to arranging the lives of the masses.

　　全国棉花收购形势很好
    收购量比去年同期增长58％，进度不断飞升，质量普遍提高
    邯郸专区农商大协作棉花收购任务提前完成
    据新华社17日讯　来势猛、规模大、进度快、质量好，这是今年新棉收购运动的最大特点。目前，一个既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的新棉收购运动已经在全国范围内形成高潮。截至10月14日，全国棉花收购量比去年同期增加了58％，河北、山东、湖南、山西、新疆等省、区，都比去年同期增加一倍以上。
    各地自9月初开始收购新棉以来，收购量逐旬上升。9月上旬全国每天平均收购新棉十三万担，9月中旬就上升到二十五万担，9月下旬又上升到四十五万担，国庆节后从10月6日到10日，每天平均收购量进一步上升到五十五万担，10月10日一天就收购了九十八万担，创造了历史上每日收购量的最高纪录。不仅收购入库的速度快，数量多，而且新棉质量普遍提高。据各地反映，今年收购的棉花普遍比去年提高了一级，质量良好的三、四级棉大量出现，六级以下的棉花很少（棉花质量共分十二个等级）。河北省南宫县章台公社质量上等的二、三级棉占入库总数的98.8％。
    今年棉花收购工作所以取得这样显著的成绩，主要是各级党委加强了对收购工作的领导，坚决贯彻了党的八届八中全会的决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起了声势浩大的群众运动，同时又进行了细致踏实的组织工作，因此运动的发展极为健康。各地在采摘新棉时，普遍发动群众做好“四分”（即分摘、分晒、分存、分售）工作，推行了“三兜摘棉”或“双兜摘棉”等先进方法，有效地提高了棉花的质量。为了做到边采摘、边收购、边加工、边调运，各地党委在短途运输和加工力量方面都作了细致的安排，做到环环扣紧一气呵成。
    新华社邯郸17日电　著名的棉产区——河北省邯郸专区，在棉花收购工作中由于开展了以摘棉售棉为中心的农商大协作群众运动，摘棉售棉的速度、质量超过以往任何一年。到15日止，全专区已经提前完成了今年全年的棉花收购任务。
    这个专区的五百多万亩棉花，进入10月正是吐絮盛期，整个棉区一片银海。从10月8日以来，全专区投入摘棉、售棉运动的男女社员已达二百多万人，平均每天收购籽棉五千多万斤。到15日止，全专区已收购和加工的籽棉，都比去年同期增加了六倍多。全专区比去年提前六个月完成了今年全年的棉花收购任务。中共邯郸地委号召全专区社员在完成今年棉花收购任务的基础上继续跃进，进一步超额完成全年的收购任务。
    邯郸专区在棉花收购中开展的农商大协作，是以组织公社生产队快摘细摘、快运送为中心，通过采摘和收购、机器加工和民间人力轧花加工、摘售棉花和三秋生产、短途运输和专途运输的密切配合互相支援，把生产、收购、运输、加工像一条锁链一样的连结在一起，使各项任务环环相扣。这样，就解决了摘棉售棉和收购、加工和外调以及三秋生产和收购之间的矛盾，大大加快了棉花收购工作的进度，又保证了三秋生产。
    加强党的统一领导，坚持政治挂帅，是邯郸专区在棉花收购中组织群众性的农商大协作的基本保证。各县县委早在8月底，就结合贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，运用大鸣大放大辩论方法，对形形色色的本位主义思想和畏难情绪进行了批判，树立了一盘棋思想。各公社生产队普遍召开了摘棉能手、摘棉专业队和老农参加的座谈会，用具体算账方法说明早摘快摘和推行四分（分摘、分晒、分存、分运）提高棉花等级的好处。由于棉花等级提高，使社员增加收入六千多万元。在发动社员快摘的同时，全专区三百六十一个收棉站也开展了以简化手续、提高收购效率为内容的五比竞赛，做到了随送随收一包不留。
    建立统一的领导机构、全面合理地安排劳动力，是邯郸专区迅速完成收购任务的另一个重要原因。这个专区从专区、县、公社一直到生产队，都建立了棉花收购联合指挥部，由党委书记挂帅，统一指挥调配人、畜力量。各生产队根据棉花产量和三秋生产的任务大小、分别组织了摘棉、秋耕种麦专业队，使收棉三秋两不误。各县收购部门还抽出几千名干部派往棉区各生产队作联络员，帮助生产队解决收购当中的问题。各县还认真地贯彻了按劳分配原则，实行了计工报酬加工奖励的分配办法，同时普遍注意了安排群众的生活。
