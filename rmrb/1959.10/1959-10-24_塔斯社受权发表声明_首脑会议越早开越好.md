    TASS Authorized to Issue Statement
    Summit Conference Should Be Held Sooner Rather Than Later
    Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd - TASS's statement on October 23rd:
    Foreign newspapers have published many contradictory reports regarding the Soviet government's position on the timing of a summit conference. The purpose of convening a summit conference is to discuss pressing issues in order to ease international tension and strengthen peace.
    TASS is authorized to issue the following statement in this regard:
    The Soviet government's repeatedly clarified position on this issue remains unchanged. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to convene a summit conference and is prepared to participate in such a conference. The Soviet government also shares the view with other countries that the earlier a summit conference is held, the better it will be for the cause of peace. Currently, the timing of the meeting is the subject of discussion among the parties concerned.
    The Soviet government also takes into account that the heads of government of various countries, enjoying high prestige and possessing the necessary authority, can and should resolve matured issues to ease international tensions. If the heads of government of various countries reach agreements on major issues, this can create favorable conditions for improving relations between countries and strengthening universal peace.

    塔斯社受权发表声明
    首脑会议越早开越好
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社23日的声明：
    外国报纸就苏联政府在召开政府首脑会议的时间上采取的立场一事发表了许多前后矛盾的消息。召开政府首脑会议是为了讨论刻不容缓的问题，以缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平。
    塔斯社受权就此发表声明：
    苏联政府对这个问题所一再阐明的立场现在仍然不变。苏联政府认为有必要召开政府首脑会议，并且准备参加这种会议。苏联政府也同其他国家一样持有这种看法，即政府首脑会议越早召开，对和平事业就越有好处。目前，关于召开会议的时间问题是有关方面讨论的对象。
    苏联政府还考虑到，享有很高威信和拥有必要权力的各国政府首脑，能够并且应当解决成熟了的问题以缓和国际紧张局势。如果各国政府首脑就主要问题达成协议，那末这就能够创造良好的条件，来改善各国之间的关系和加强普遍和平。
