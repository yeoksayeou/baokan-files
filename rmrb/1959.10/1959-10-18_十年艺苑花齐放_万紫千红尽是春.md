    "A Decade of Art Blooming: Myriad Purples and Crimson Reds Herald Spring," people use these words to describe the celebratory performances of the arts community marking the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.
    Since the announcement of the programs for the performances, long queues have often appeared in front of the ticket offices in various theaters in the capital, as well as on Wangfujing, Xidan and other major streets. People, eager to be among the first to see the shows, jostled to buy tickets. At the end of many performances, the emotions of the Chinese and foreign audiences and the actors on stage intertwined as one. Many audience members left the theater still immersed in the edification of art.
    Audiences not only appreciated traditional operas such as Peking Opera, Yue Opera, Cantonese Opera, and Kunqu Opera, but they were also inspired by some dramas, dances, and music that were full of the spirit of the times. The workers of the Beijing Chemical Factory were eager to see the drama "Taming Dragons and Tigers," which reflects the Great Leap Forward of the people in the mountainous areas, but they did not buy group tickets. When they saw the scene "Unveiling the Red List" in the play on television, they were deeply moved. Recently, at the general meeting of all employees to discuss the flying start after the National Day holiday, the workers also learned from the "unveiling of the red list" on the stage, enthusiastically beating gongs and drums, setting up a challenge stage, and posting red lists. Whichever workshop had the largest output value and highest efficiency was the challenger. This vigorous scene greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. People believe that this play has a profound appeal.
    Many art troupes have constantly received enthusiastic letters, which is the greatest encouragement to literary and art workers. A worker from the Beijing Lifting Machine Factory said in a letter to the Central Experimental Opera House that "The Lotus Lantern" is a flower, and hopes that the theater will perform more dance dramas with such unique national style. A soldier of the People's Liberation Army said in a letter to the Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe after watching Qinqiang Opera "Touring West Lake": "The Qinqiang Opera tune is rich and can express various character personalities, and I have developed a strong interest in it." Similar examples are too numerous to mention.
    Overseas Chinese and audiences from other provinces who have lived in Beijing for a long time are very concerned about whether local programs can participate in this celebratory performance. Some overseas Chinese, after watching "Guan Hanqing," felt greatly excited that this "Southern Red Bean" could compete with other brother opera genres in the motherland's art world. A Hubei native who has lived in Beijing for a long time, after watching the Han Opera "Twice Blooming Plum," repeatedly praised that under the leadership of the Party, the Han Opera has become so beautiful and rich. After the show, he sent the actors out of the theater one by one before returning home contentedly.
    The ethnic minority visiting delegations were particularly interested in ethnic song and dance. Many members of the delegations sang and clapped all the way back after watching the songs and dances each time, and were still talking about it late into the night. Some ethnic minority observers were deeply moved after seeing the leaders of the central government go on stage to shake hands and take photos with the actors after watching the performance in the CPPCC Auditorium. Representatives of the Zhuang and Dong ethnic groups said: No wonder the performance was so good, and the level of performance has improved so quickly. This has a great relationship with the Party's respect and sincere care for artists. Many representatives of the Tibetan visiting delegation believed that the Ping Opera "Along the Jinsha River" and the opera "Spring Thunder" gave them a deep education. When Tibetan youths Dunzhu and Basang watched these two plays, contrasting today's happy life with the tragic situation in which their families had been exploited and persecuted by aristocrats for generations in the past, they were so excited that they cried bitterly.
    Many foreign guests praised the celebratory performances. The famous Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén used the words "very beautiful" to describe the Yue Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber." He said that this play proves that Oriental classical art is very beautiful. Wang Wenjuan, who played Lin Daiyu, performed so realistically and movingly that one cannot help but think of Marguerite in "La Traviata." They are both typical women who protested against the evil system of the old society with their lives and youth in pursuit of a happy love. Guillén also praised China's literary and artistic policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." He believes that it is very "wise" to constantly remove the dross and extract the essence of traditional plays. Danish playwright Soja said: I have seen Peking Opera, Sichuan Opera, and Yue Opera. Although I don’t understand Chinese and it is the first time I have come into contact with such rich and colorful opera genres, I feel that it is easy to understand, as natural as young people understanding love.
    The performed dramas, dance dramas and vocal arts also aroused great interest among foreign guests. Guests from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and many other countries gave high praise to the "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony" and "Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto" performed by Chinese musicians. They also greatly appreciated the dance drama "The Lotus Lantern," which is full of national characteristics. Some foreign playwrights said to the translators while watching the drama "Sunrise" that they could understand the progress of the plot from the actors' delicate and moving facial expressions. Let every flower bloom to its heart's content! A Colombian guest, listening to the chorus "Immortal Warrior" describing Huang Jiguang's heroic sacrifice, said to the Chinese friends present with tears in his eyes: This program is not only artistic, but more importantly, it praises labor and heroes, and it serves the people's cause. Many foreign guests were very excited after listening to the "Grand Chorus" performed by the Generals Chorus, and the applause lasted for a long time. They said excitedly: "This is truly unforgettable art!"

　　十年艺苑花齐放　万紫千红尽是春
　　本报记者　朱继功　智洁纹
    “十年艺苑花齐放，万紫千红尽是春”，人们用这两句话来形容文艺界庆祝建国十周年的献礼演出。
    自从献演节目公布以后，首都各个剧院以及王府井、西单等主要街道上的售票站前，常常出现一条条“长龙”。人们抱着先睹为快的心理，争先恐后地排队买戏票。许多节目演出结束时，台下的中、外观众和台上的演员感情上交织成一片。许多观众离开了剧场，还沉浸在艺术的陶冶中。
    观众们不但欣赏京剧、越剧、粤剧、昆曲等传统剧目，他们更为一些富有时代气息的戏剧、舞蹈、音乐所激奋。北京化工厂的职工渴望着能看到反映山区人民大跃进的话剧“降龙伏虎”，可是没买到团体票。当他们从电视里看到了这个话剧中“揭红榜”一场后，受到深刻的感动。最近在全体职工讨论国庆节后开门红的大会上，职工们也学着舞台上“揭红榜”那样，群情激昂地敲锣打鼓，摆起擂台，贴起红榜。哪个车间产值大、效率高，就是擂台主。这个轰轰烈烈的场面大大地鼓舞了职工们的干劲。人们认为这出戏有很深的感染力。
    许多艺术团体不断接到热情洋溢的来信，这是观众们对文艺工作者最大的鼓舞。北京起重机器厂一位职工给中央实验歌剧院的信中说，“宝莲灯”是一朵花，希望剧院多多排演具有这样独特民族风格的舞剧。一位解放军战士看了秦腔“游西湖”以后在给陕西省戏曲演出团的信中说：“秦腔曲调丰富，能够表现各种人物性格，我已经对它发生了浓厚的兴趣”。类似这样的例子不胜枚举。
    来自海外的华侨和久居北京的外省观众十分关心本地的节目能够参加这次献礼演出。有些华侨看了“关汉卿”以后，为这颗“南国红豆”能和其他兄弟剧种一起在祖国艺坛上争妍，感到莫大的兴奋。一位长时间住在北京的湖北人看了汉剧“二度梅”以后，连连称赞在党的领导下，汉剧变得如此优美、丰富。散戏后，他把演员们一一送出剧场才满意地回去。
    少数民族参观团对民族歌舞特别感到兴趣，许多团员每次看完歌舞回来一路上边唱、边鼓掌，直到深夜还在谈论不休。一些少数民族的观礼代表在政协礼堂看完演出后，见到领导同志上台同演员握手、合影，大家感动极了，僮族、侗族的代表们说：怪不得演得这么好，演出水平提高这样快，这与党对艺人的尊重和真切的关怀，有很大关系。藏族参观团的许多代表们认为评剧“金沙江畔”、歌剧“春雷”给他们的教育很深。藏族青年顿珠、巴桑等看这两个剧时，对比今天的幸福生活和过去他们家里祖祖辈辈受贵族剥削、迫害的悲惨情景，竟激动地痛哭起来。
    很多外宾看了献礼剧目以后，都赞不绝口。著名的古巴诗人尼古拉·纪廉用“非常美妙”这几个字来形容越剧“红楼梦”。他说，这出戏证明东方古典艺术是十分优美的。饰演林黛玉的王文娟演得那么逼真动人，不由人想起“茶花女”中的玛格丽特。她们都是为追求幸福的爱情，用自己的生命和青春来抗议旧社会的罪恶制度的典型女性。纪廉还赞扬我国“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺方针。他认为，不断地使传统剧目去芜存精，这种作法是很“智慧”的。丹麦剧作家索雅说：我看了京剧、川剧、越剧，虽然我不懂中国话，又是第一次接触到这样丰富多采的剧种，但是我感到它是容易了解的，好像年轻人了解爱情那样自然。
    演出的话剧、舞剧和歌唱艺术也引起了外宾们很大的兴趣。苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他许多国家的来宾，对我国音乐家演奏的“贝多芬第九交响乐”、“柴可夫斯基钢琴协奏曲”给予很高评价。他们也很欣赏富于民族特点的舞剧“宝莲灯”。有的外国剧作家在看话剧“日出”时对翻译人员说，从演员细致动人的面部表情中，我可以了解剧情的进展。让每一朵鲜花尽情地开放吧！哥伦比亚一位贵宾在听描写黄继光英勇牺牲的大合唱“不朽的战士”时，热泪盈眶地对在场的中国朋友说：这个节目不仅具有艺术性，更重要的是歌颂了劳动，歌颂了英雄，它是为人民事业服务的。好多外宾听了将军合唱团演出的“大合唱”以后十分激动，掌声经久不息。他们兴奋地说：“这真是令人难忘的艺术！”
