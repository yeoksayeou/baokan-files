Visiting Miyun Reservoir
Now I see gulls and fish leaping.
Yesterday, deer still roamed.
Holding back floods, relying on the giant dam,
Storing water, a light boat drifts.
The pole's reflection follows the curve of the peaks,
The sound of waves gently caresses the shore.
A thousand acres of waves spread flat,
Horizontally cutting off two rivers.
The harvest is good in every commune,
Everyone's enthusiasm is excellent.
Li Bing's chiseling is pleasing,
Bo Gun's embanking is without fault.
Together, we celebrate the completion of the reservoir,
From now on, the year will have an autumn harvest.
Dragons are tamed at the bottom of the valley,
Fish and rice go up the mountain top.
Singing praises of creating the sea and moving mountains,
The South of the Yangtze and the North sing in praise.
The red flag flutters high,
A single glance takes in the water and sky.

    游密云水库
    谢觉哉今见鸥鱼跃。昨犹麋鹿游。拦洪倚巨坝。潴水泛轻舟。篙影随峰曲。涛声拍岸柔。平铺千顷浪。横截两河流。社社收成好。人人干劲优。李冰凿可喜。伯鲧堙无尤。共庆水成库。从兹年有秋。蛟龙驯谷底。鱼米上山头。造海移山颂。江南塞北讴。红旗高处颭。一望水天收。
