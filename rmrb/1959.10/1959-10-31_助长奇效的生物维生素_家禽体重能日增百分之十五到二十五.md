    Miraculous Growth-Promoting Biovitamin
    Poultry Weight Can Increase by Fifteen to Twenty-Five Percent Daily
    Soviet biochemist Bukin recently successfully developed a highly effective biovitamin B12, used to mix with feed to feed livestock and poultry. It can increase the weight of poultry by 15% to 25% every day.
    This important creation was mentioned in the materials recently announced by the Soviet News Bureau. The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences gave this creation a very high evaluation and has suggested that Soviet livestock workers widely adopt this vitamin.
    Scientist Bukin is currently leading the research work of the Vitamin Laboratory of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He is already sixty years old this year. In view of the enormous role that vitamins can play in the lives of people and animals, this old scientist began research on the manufacture of vitamin B12 nine years ago. He had extracted vitamin B12 from waste materials obtained from food industry, fish processing and other enterprises, but none of them achieved the expected results. Bukin believed that if vitamin B12 and antibiotics enter the animal's body at the same time, it will produce a greater effect. As a result, Bukin found a method to successfully obtain a drug containing vitamin B12 and chlortetracycline at the same time.
    The vitamin B12 manufactured by Bukin can not only increase the weight of poultry by 15% to 25% every day, but also save one-tenth of the feed at the same time. According to estimates by Latvian scientists, raising livestock with this vitamin can increase the republic's meat production by 30,000 tons per year.
    The manufacture of this vitamin is not complicated. It does not require any basic construction and can be produced using existing alcohol and hydrolysis industrial enterprises. Because feed-grade vitamin B12 does not require very pure crystals, as long as the semi-finished product contains a certain amount. Dry the semi-finished product of this vitamin and mix half a kilogram into each ton of feed.
    At present, the Soviet Union has begun mass production of this vitamin, and the recent output has reached 6,000 to 8,000 tons, which can fully meet the needs of the Soviet livestock industry.

### 助长奇效的生物维生素  家禽体重能日增百分之十五到二十五

    助长奇效的生物维生素
    家禽体重能日增百分之十五到二十五
    苏联生物化学家布金最近制造成功一种效果极高的生物维生素乙12，用来拌和饲料喂养牲畜和家禽。它可以使家禽体重每天增加15％到25％。
    这一重要创造是在最近苏联新闻局所公布的材料中提到的。苏联科学院主席团对这一创造，给予了极高的评价，并已建议苏联畜牧工作者广泛采用这种维生素。
    科学家布金目前正领导着苏联科学院生素化学研究所维生素实验室的研究工作，他今年已经六十岁了。鉴于维生素对人和动物的生活能起巨大的作用，这位老科学家在九年之前就开始研究制造维生素乙12的工作。他曾从食品工业、鱼类加工等企业所获得的废料中提取维生素乙12，但都没有获得预期的结果。布金认为，如果维生素乙12和抗菌素同时进入动物的机体，就会产生更大的效果。结果，布金找到了一种方法，成功地获得了含有维生素乙12并同时含有金霉素的药剂。
    布金所制造的维生素乙12不仅可以使家禽每天增加重量15％到25％，而且可以同时节省饲料十分之一。据拉脱维亚科学家估计，用这种维生素饲养牲畜，每年可为共和国多增加三万吨肉类。
    制造这种维生素并不复杂，它不需要什么基本建设，利用现有的酒精和水解工业企业就能生产。因为，饲料用维生素乙12不需要很纯的结晶，只要使半成品中含有一定的分量就行。将这种维生素乙12的半成品晒干，在每吨饲料中拌入半公斤就可以了。
    目前，苏联已经开始大批生产这种维生素，最近产量已达到六千到八千吨，能完全满足苏联畜牧业需要。
