Singing for the New China
By our correspondent Su Lan

The crimson curtains of the Prince Theatre in London slowly opened, and a tall, smiling singer appeared on stage. It was Paul Robeson.

On the evening of the 4th, this world-renowned black singer specially contributed to the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association's concert celebrating our National Day. This was no ordinary performance. He poured all his deep friendship for the Chinese people, which he had consistently held for decades, and the irrepressible joy caused by the rapid progress of New China, into his loud and deep singing. As an outstanding humanitarian, as an excellent son of the American people, as a singer of the peace movement, he sang with abandon, offering the warmest and most sincere congratulations to the Chinese people who are galloping to build socialism. His burning feelings infected the audience and quickly resonated deep in people's hearts.

When China was in the dark ages, Robeson had held many concerts for the Chinese people in London. He sang "Fengyang Flower Drum," which told of "nine years of famine out of ten," lamenting the suffering of the Chinese people. He also sang the exciting "March of the Volunteers," reflecting the Chinese people's will to resist aggression. It was he who spread this magnificent song all over the world. Today, he sang "In a faraway place, there is a good girl..." "Brother rides a horse, I ride a dragon..." These songs are full of optimism and joy.

Robeson told reporters that his grandfather had been captured from Africa and taken to America. His father still had not escaped the fate of being a slave. His life experiences made him understand the value of freedom. Therefore, when he saw a new China appearing on the stage of history, the joy in his heart was indescribable.

Robeson has a special love for Chinese culture and art. He said that he has a pretty good Chinese library in the United States, which houses all English translations of Chinese literature and many Chinese books. Some of the Chinese poetry collections and songbooks he can understand, he takes with him wherever he goes. Whenever he meets Chinese friends, he can't help but sing a passage from a Chinese song.

Many people who have heard Robeson sing in Chinese are surprised by his clear pronunciation and his ability to express emotions. And when you know that this singer, who is over sixty years old, is learning the languages of more than twenty countries, you will admire him even more. Some of the pages of Robeson's Chinese textbooks have fallen off, but every line is densely filled with annotations. He said, "I learn a few Chinese characters every day, listen to Chinese records, and write a few lines of Chinese calligraphy."

When asked about his thoughts on the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China, he used his unique baritone voice, as if reciting poetry, and said:

"On the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, people see how much incredible achievement and progress the Chinese people have made in just a few years. This achievement and progress shows the strength of socialism, and it also shows what power the people can unleash once they are free to build their own country and control their own destiny! That is why, with deep respect, emotion and love, I congratulate the People's Republic of China on its tenth anniversary."

### 为新中国歌唱

    为新中国歌唱
    本报记者　苏蓝
    伦敦太子剧院的绛色帷幕慢慢拉开了，一位身材魁伟、满面笑容的歌唱家出现在舞台上。他，就是保罗·罗伯逊。
    4日晚上，这位世界闻名的黑人歌王，特地为英中友协举办的庆祝我国国庆的音乐会贡献了节目。这不是一次普通的表演。他把自己几十年来对中国人民一贯的深厚友谊，把自己对新中国一日千里的成就所引起的压抑不住的喜悦，全部倾注在那洪亮、深厚的歌声里。他作为一个杰出的人道主义者，作为美国人民的优秀儿子，作为和平运动的歌手，纵情歌唱，向正在快马飞腾建设社会主义的中国人民，致以最热烈最衷心的祝贺。他那灼热的感情，感染着听众，在人们心灵深处迅速地引起了共鸣。
    当中国处于黑暗年代的时候，罗伯逊就曾在伦敦为中国人民举行过许多次音乐会。他唱过“十年倒有九年荒”的“凤阳花鼓”，倾诉了中国人民的苦难。他更唱过激动人心的“义勇军进行曲”，反映了中国人民反抗侵略的斗争意志。正是他，把这支雄壮的歌曲，传播到全世界。今天，他又唱着“在那遥远的地方，有位好姑娘……”“哥哥骑马我骑龙……”。这些歌声充满了乐观、欢欣的情绪。
    罗伯逊向记者说，他的祖父是被人从非洲抓到美国去的。他的父亲，仍然没有摆脱当奴隶的命运。生活的经历使他懂得自由的可贵。因此，当他看到一个新中国出现在历史舞台上的时候，他内心的喜悦是无法形容的。
    罗伯逊对中国的文化艺术特别喜爱。他说，他在美国有一个挺不错的中国图书室，那里保藏着所有的英译中国文学作品以及许多中文书籍。他能看懂的一些中国诗集和歌册，都是走到那里，带到那里。每当遇到中国朋友时，他总是情不自禁地唱上一段中国歌曲。
    许多听过罗伯逊用中文歌唱的人，都为他咬字清楚和善于表达情感而惊奇。而当你知道这位年逾六十的歌唱家，正在学着二十多个国家的语言时，就会对他更加钦佩。罗伯逊所学的中文课本，有些篇页已经脱落了，但在每一字里行间，都密密麻麻地写满注解。他说：“我每天都要学几个中国字，听一听中文唱片，写几行中文小楷。”
    当记者问到他对新中国成立十周年有什么感想时，他用那特有的男低音，像朗诵着诗句似地说：
    “在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，人们看到在短短几年里中国人民已创造了多么令人难以置信的成就和进步。这种成就和进步显示了社会主义的力量，它也表明：人民一旦获得自由来建设自己的祖国，掌握了自己的命运以后，能够发挥怎样的威力！正因为这样，我怀着深深的尊敬、情感和热爱，祝贺中华人民共和国成立十周年。”
