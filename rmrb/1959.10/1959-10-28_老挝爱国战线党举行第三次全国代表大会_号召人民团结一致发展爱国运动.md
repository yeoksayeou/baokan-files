Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th. "Lao Patriotic News" published on October 22nd released the communique of the Third National Congress of the Lao Patriotic Front Party. The full text is as follows:

Since the U.S. imperialists, the Sananikone clique, and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" provoked the civil war in Laos, the situation in Laos has become increasingly tense. In order to analyze the situation and propose working ideas and guidelines adapted to the new situation, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party convened the Third National Congress of the Lao Patriotic Front Party.

Participating in the congress were: Phay Dang, Kaysone, Thao Douang, Titham, and Me Soui, members of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party; representatives of the provincial committees of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, including representatives of all ethnic groups, strata, and religious circles; representatives of the Second Battalion; and representatives of the National People's Armed Forces.

The congress was held tensely for three days in late September 1959. The congress was conducted in an atmosphere of excitement, unity, and confidence, and it ended victoriously.

After listening to the political report of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, the congress unanimously adopted the following:

I. The congress believes that because U.S. imperialism is increasingly and blatantly interfering in an attempt to turn Laos into its colony and military base, our beloved Laos is facing a serious threat of war, and the Lao people are in dire straits.

The Sananikone clique and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," in accordance with the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, deliberately provoked the civil war. They launched military offensives in an attempt to eliminate the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces, carried out extensive sweeps, brutally persecuted the people, arrested the leaders of the Lao Fighting Forces, including Prince Souphanouvong, and undermined the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. Now they are trying their best to expand the civil war and spread the flames of war throughout Laos. They also introduced the so-called "United Nations Fact-Finding Committee" into Laos in order to create conditions for U.S. imperialist armed intervention in Laos. This is their heinous crime against the motherland and the people.

Faced with the serious threat of a civil war spreading across the country, all the Lao people hate them. All Lao people, regardless of ethnicity, class, age, or gender, whether in the mountains, plains, or cities, have risen up to struggle under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front Party. At the same time, many people in the Kingdom's army and government sympathize with and support the people, and have joined the people's ranks to jointly launch a national salvation movement against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The struggle of our people throughout the country is growing stronger and developing, and has achieved victories in all aspects.

II. The congress fully approves and supports the appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on August 2, 1959, which puts forward the working line, principles, and plans of the Patriotic Front Party. The congress believes that in the current situation in Laos, the Lao Patriotic Front Party's struggle stance has not changed. The Party's unwavering stance is to form a broad unity including all ethnic groups, classes, and religions, gather all forces that love the motherland and peace, and struggle for the strict and thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, for the restoration of the imprisoned Prince Souphanouvong and some other leaders and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, for the cessation of the civil war, and for the cessation of U.S. imperialist interference in Laos, and to carry out a brave and unremitting struggle to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos. This line fully conforms to the aspirations of our people and to the current domestic and international situation.

III. The congress believes that the only way to ease the tense situation in Laos, eliminate U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to turn Laos into a colony, and save the Lao people from war, devastation, and death is to strictly and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and to implement a policy of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unity.

For the supreme interests of the motherland, for the interests of national harmony and national unity, if the Lao Royal Government is willing to show sincerity in peacefully resolving internal problems and stopping the civil war, the Lao Patriotic Front Party is ready at any time to resolve all disputes through peaceful negotiations, so that Laos can embark on the road of peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. On the contrary, if the Phoui Sananikone government refuses to abandon its traitorous and harmful conspiracy, and blindly obeys the instructions of U.S. imperialism, expands the civil war, and brutally suppresses the people, the Lao Patriotic Front Party will have no choice but to mobilize the people of the whole country to resolutely and unremittingly struggle to the final victory.

IV. When U.S. imperialism, the Sananikone clique, and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" deliberately expand the civil war in Laos, in order to have enough strength to stop their extremely dangerous conspiracy in time, the congress calls on the people of Laos to unite closely, vigorously develop the patriotic movement against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. All Lao patriotic and peace-loving people, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, class, religion, or political views, must unite and fight together to demand that U.S. imperialism must withdraw its military personnel and weapons from Laos, abolish U.S. military bases in Laos, demand an end to the civil war, demand the restoration of the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party who are being imprisoned, release cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party and Lao patriotic people who are being detained; demand that the International Commission resume its activities in Laos; demand the strict and full implementation of the Geneva Accords and various Vientiane Agreements.

V. The congress feels honored and satisfied with the victories achieved in the struggle movement in the past period, and expresses warm praise for the resolute and heroic fighting spirit of our cadres, soldiers, and people.

The congress welcomes the position of Prime Minister Nehru, Prime Minister Sihanouk, and the governments of Asian and African countries in demanding the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos and the restoration of the International Commission's activities in Laos.

The congress welcomes the initiative of the Soviet government, one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, to reconvene the Geneva Conference in order to resolve the Lao issue through peaceful consultation on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

The congress expresses gratitude and welcomes the strong support of the World Peace Council and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council for the just struggle of the Lao people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The congress expresses respect and trust to Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee and beloved leader of all ethnic groups in Laos, and other leaders of the Central Executive Committee who are being imprisoned by U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone clique.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, so as to victoriously lead the increasingly strong and developing patriotic struggle movement of the Lao people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the congress re-elected fifteen central committee members, including Khamtay Siphandone and Boung Phommahasay, representatives of Lower Laos, Sisavath, representative of Sam Neua Province, Phouma, representative of Phongsaly Province, Sisophon, representative of Vientiane Province, Khaheng, representative of the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces, and Chuan Men, representative of Khammouane Province.

The congress unanimously elected Kaysone as the vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party.

Finally, the congress expressed its firm belief that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, based on the spirit of patriotism and love of peace of our people, as well as the tradition of unity and heroic struggle, and with the sympathy and support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, the just struggle of the Lao people will surely be victorious, and U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will surely suffer a tragic defeat.

    号召人民团结一致发展爱国运动
    公报指出：如果老挝王国政府愿意拿出诚意来和平解决内部问题和停止内战，老挝爱国战线党随时准备通过和平谈判解决一切争端；如果萨纳尼空政府不肯放弃卖国殃民的阴谋，一味听从美国的指使，扩大内战和野蛮地镇压人民，老挝爱国战线党就不得不动员全国人民坚决地、不懈地斗争到最后胜利。
    新华社河内27日电　10月22日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”发表了老挝爱国战线党第三次全国代表大会的公报。全文如下：
    自从美帝国主义、萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目挑起老挝内战以来，老挝局势日益紧张起来。为了分析局势和提出适应新形势的工作主张和方针，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会召开了老挝爱国战线党第三次代表大会。
    参加大会的有：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会委员费当、凯山、陶杜、梯丹、梅苏；老挝爱国战线党各省委员会代表，包括各族、各阶层和宗教界代表；第二营的代表和全国人民武装力量的代表。
    大会在1959年9月下旬的三天内紧张地进行，大会是在兴奋、团结和有信心的气氛中进行的，并胜利地结束了。
    在听取老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的政治报告后，大会一致通过了下列事项：
    一、大会认为，由于美帝国主义企图把老挝变成它的殖民地和军事基地而日益深入和明目张胆地进行干涉，我们可爱的老挝正在受到战争的严重威胁，老挝人民正处在水深火热之中。
    萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们按照美帝国主义的阴谋，故意挑起内战。他们进行军事进攻，企图消灭寮国战斗部队第二营，大肆进行扫荡，野蛮地迫害人民，逮捕寮国战斗部队的领导人，其中包括苏发努冯亲王，破坏了日内瓦协议和万象协议。现在他们正在竭力扩大内战，使战争火焰蔓延老挝全境。他们还把所谓“联合国调查小组委员会”引进老挝，以便为美帝国主义武装干涉老挝创造条件。这是他们对祖国、对人民的滔天罪行。
    面对着蔓延全国的内战的严重威胁，全体老挝人民都痛恨他们。不分民族、阶级的男女老少、无论在山区、平原或城市的全体老挝人民，都在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，起来进行斗争。同时，王国军队和政权中的许多人也同情、支持人民，并投向人民的队伍来，同人民联合展开反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的救国运动。我国人民在全国范围内的斗争日益壮大和发展，并在各方面取得了胜利。
    二、大会完全赞成和支持老挝爱国战线党中央1959年8月2日发表的号召书，这个号召书提出了爱国战线党的工作路线、方针和计划。大会认为，在老挝当前局势下，老挝爱国战线党的斗争立场没有改变。党的坚定不移的立场是结成包括各民族、各阶层、各宗教的广泛的大团结，集合一切爱祖国、爱和平的力量，为要求严正和彻底履行日内瓦协议和万象协议、要求恢复正被监禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他一些领导人和干部、要求停止内战、要求美帝国主义停止对老挝的干涉而斗争，为建设和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而进行勇敢的不懈的斗争。这个路线完全符合我国人民的愿望，符合当前国内外形势。
    三、大会认为，缓和老挝的紧张局势，消除美帝国主义企图把老挝变成殖民地的阴谋，使老挝人民免于战争、摧残和死亡的唯一的道路是严正和彻底履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，实行和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政策。
  为了祖国的最高利益，为了民族和睦、国家统一的政策的利益，如果老挝王国政府愿意拿出诚意来和平解决内部问题和停止内战，老挝爱国战线党随时准备通过和平谈判解决一切争端，使老挝在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上走上和平、中立、独立、民主的道路。相反的，如果培·萨纳尼空政府不肯放弃卖国殃民的阴谋，一味听从美帝国主义的指使，扩大内战和野蛮地镇压人民，老挝爱国战线党方面就不得不动员全国人民坚决地、不懈地斗争到最后胜利为止。
    四、当美帝国主义、萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目蓄意扩大老挝内战的时候，为了具备足够的力量来及时制止他们罪大恶极的危险的阴谋，大会号召老挝全国人民紧密地团结一致，大力发展反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国运动。所有的老挝爱国、爱和平人民，不分男女老少、民族、阶层、宗教和政见，一致团结奋起斗争，要求美帝国主义必须撤走它在老挝的军事人员和武器，取消美国在老挝的军事基地，要求停止内战，要求恢复苏发努冯亲王和正被监禁的老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，释放正被拘禁的老挝爱国战线党干部和老挝爱国人民；要求国际委员会恢复在老挝的活动；要求严格地和充分地履行日内瓦协议和各项万象协议。
    五、过去期间的斗争运动所取得的胜利使大会感到光荣和满意，大会对我国干部、战士和人民的坚决而英勇的斗争精神表示热烈的赞扬。
    大会对尼赫鲁总理、西哈努克首相和亚非各国政府要求履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和恢复国际委员会在老挝的活动的立场表示欢迎。
    大会对日内瓦会议的主席之一的苏联政府关于重新召开日内瓦会议，以便在日内瓦协议的基础上，用和平协商的方式来解决老挝问题的倡议表示欢迎。
    大会对世界和平理事会和亚非人民团结理事会大力支持老挝人民反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的正义斗争表示感谢和欢迎。
    大会对中央执行委员会主席、老挝各民族的敬爱的领袖苏发努冯亲王和正被美帝国主义和萨纳尼空集团监禁的中央执行委员会其他领导人表示敬爱和信任。
    为了加强老挝爱国战线党的领导力量，以便胜利地领导老挝人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的日益壮大和发展的爱国斗争运动，大会补选了十五位中央委员，其中包括有下寮地区代表坎代西番乐、布·丰马哈赛，桑怒省代表西沙瓦，丰沙里省代表丰马，万象省代表西索芬，寮国战斗部队第二营代表卡亨，甘蒙省代表川门等。
    大会一致选出凯山为老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席。
    大会最后表示坚信，在老挝爱国战线党中央委员会英明的领导下，本着我国人民爱国、爱和平的精神以及团结一致和英勇斗争的传统，并得到全世界爱好和平和主持公理的人民的同情和支持，老挝人民的正义斗争，一定会取得胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗一定会遭到悲惨的失败。
