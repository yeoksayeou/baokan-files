    Anguo Spirit
    Ge De
    Anguo, this is the most beautiful painting drawn by the Party and the people on a blank sheet of paper, the best poem written.
    People say that Anguo's cannon has been thoroughly fired. "Anguo is good" has already been universally recognized. You ask the neighbors of Anguo for directions: how to get to Anguo? The answer is always: "Go forward, and when you see the crops are different, when you see the land is particularly well cultivated, then you have entered the border of Anguo." Writers and artists who have visited Anguo said: "The land of Anguo is a piece of brocade." Anguo, in this way, meets all visitors with a distinctly different appearance.
    Anguo is galloping swiftly on the broad road, but the journey is not always smooth. The air surrounding Anguo has changed several times; anti-socialist forces have also launched several attacks.
    In 1955, Anguo achieved a complete victory in the socialist transformation of the countryside; in 1956, Anguo launched a high tide of agricultural production. Taking the lead, the surrounding air was shocked. Many places put forward the slogan of learning from Anguo and catching up with Anguo. However, soon a "saddle shape" of cooperation appeared around it; then an anti-socialist wave appeared in the countryside. Thus, there were many complaints: saying that Anguo's cooperativization had advanced rashly, and production had also advanced rashly. Therefore, among those who learned from Anguo, some also stood up to examine themselves: saying, "We were influenced by Anguo, so we were also a little rash." The anti-socialist forces took advantage of the situation to attack, saying that cooperativization had been done badly, large-scale production had been done badly, and the Communist Party could not lead. They wanted Anguo to retreat. But Anguo stood still. "We are not wrong, we want to move forward even more!" You can blame all you want, I will do good things myself; Anguo repelled the attack of the anti-socialist forces and still resolutely advanced. It has never cut down a single cooperative.
    The Great Leap Forward began, and the people's commune was realized. Anguo has always been at the forefront. The garden-like cultivation and high-yield field movement began, and the banner of "the world's first field" was erected. People began to praise Anguo again, and the atmosphere of learning from Anguo and catching up with Anguo became stronger again. However, right-leaning opportunist thinking appeared. Anguo heard all kinds of criticisms again: Anguo? Exaggerated; although the wheat is good, it is not worth the loss; building such wide roads, turning such deep soil, leveling such flat squares, applying so much fertilizer, adding so much machinery, building so much water conservancy, spending so much labor, padding so much capital... Finally, it boils down to one sentence: the rabbit's tail will not be long.
    Anguo still stood still, advancing bravely. Anguo learned to use large-scale mass movements to answer cold words. In eight months, eight production movements were carried out, and sixteen solar terms saw sixteen climaxes. The heat made the cold wind dare not approach Anguo.
    This is Anguo, which, in the case of no rain throughout the year, relied on mechanized irrigation to obtain a universal bumper harvest of wheat in the county; this is Anguo, which, in the case of unprecedented torrential rains, controlled the five rivers within its borders without causing floods, and again obtained a great autumn harvest.
    Time tested Anguo, and Anguo won; the slander of right-leaning opportunists tested Anguo, and Anguo won;
    Natural disasters tested Anguo, and Anguo won. Therefore, through Anguo's victory, people saw the heroic faces of the Anguo people, and from the heroic Anguo people, they recognized the Anguo spirit.
    The Anguo spirit is the revolutionary determination and the fearless spirit of advancing bravely. The Anguo people have the hard bones of revolutionaries and will never bow their heads to all difficulties and criticisms. The comrades in Anguo only listen to the words of the Party, and do not listen to any other idle words; the comrades in Anguo only believe in the power of the masses, and do not believe in the power of any other difficulties and obstacles. The comrades in Anguo, once they have identified the direction, will lead the masses to advance bravely, and will never retreat under any circumstances, nor will they "twist the Yangko" on the road of revolution.
    Anguo is the pride of the Party's general line and the essence of the Great Leap Forward. The comrades in Anguo said: We are wholeheartedly determined to quickly change the poor and blank face of the countryside; we are wholeheartedly determined to go all out, aim high, and build the country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The comrades in Anguo said: Some of our ideas are right and some are wrong; some of our practices are good and some are not good, but one thing is certain: we have always held high the red flag of the Party's general line, and always used Chairman Mao's instructions to examine ourselves: we must adhere to what is right, and we must change what is wrong. We will not waver on this line.
    With the development of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Anguo spirit is also expanding. Around Anguo, learning from Anguo and catching up with Anguo has now formed a broad mass movement. There is a small village in Zhuoxian County that has always been considered backward, and its farming methods have not changed much in recent years. This year it has changed. Under the impetus of the Anguo spirit, they have started large-scale high-yield fields and are determined to surpass Anguo. These spirits are valuable. This is a reflection of the Anguo spirit and a stimulation of the inherent revolutionary spirit of these regions.
    People, come to Anguo to take a look, seeing the land of Anguo is a kind of beautiful enjoyment; contacting the people of Anguo will be infected and edified by the Anguo spirit.

    安国精神
    葛德
    安国，这是党和人民在白纸上画出的最美的画，写下的最好的诗。
    人们说，安国的炮是彻底打响了。“安国好”，已经得到了普遍的公认。你去向安国的四邻问路：到安国去怎样走？回答总是：“往前走吧，你看到庄稼不一样了，看见了种得特别好的地，那就是进了安国边了。”访问过安国的作家和艺术家们说：“安国的土地一片如锦似绣”。安国，就是这样以迥然不同的面貌同一切来访的人相见的。
    安国，在康庄的大道上迅疾地奔驰着，但是，行途中却也并不一帆风顺。环绕在安国四周的空气，曾经有过几度的变化；反社会主义势力，也有过几次进攻。
    1955年，安国农村社会主义改造取得了全盘胜利；1956年，安国就掀起了农业生产的大高潮。先声夺人，周围的空气为之一震。不少地方提出了学安国、赶安国的口号。但是，不久就在四周出现了合作化的“马鞍形”；接着农村又出现了一个反社会主义的潮流。于是，烦言啧啧：说是安国的合作化冒进了，生产也冒进了。于是，学安国的人中，也有人站出来检讨：说是“我们受了安国的影响，因此也有些冒进。”反社会主义势力更是乘势攻击，合作化搞糟了，大生产搞糟了，共产党不能领导。要安国向后退。但是，安国却屹立不动。“我们没有错，我们要更向前进！”责难你自责难，好事我自为之；安国，打退了反社会主义力量的进攻，依然坚决地挺进了。它不曾砍掉过一个合作社。
  大跃进开始了，人民公社化实现了。安国始终处于上游。园田化和丰产方运动开始了，树起了“天下第一田”的旗帜。人们又开始颂扬安国，学安国赶安国的空气又浓厚起来。但是，右倾机会主义思潮出现了。安国又听到了种种非议：安国吗？浮夸；麦子虽然好，得不偿失；搞那末宽的路，翻那末深的地，整那末平的方，施那末多的肥，添那末多的机械，修那末多的水利，费那末多的工，垫那末多的本……最后归结为一句：兔子的尾巴长不了。
    安国，仍然屹立不动，勇猛向前。安国学会了用大搞群众运动来回答冷言冷语。八个月，搞了八次生产运动，十六个节气，出现过十六次高潮。热气腾腾，使得冷风不敢近安国。
    这是安国，今年在始终没有落透雨的情况下，靠了机械化浇灌，获得了全县小麦的普遍丰收；这是安国，在空前未遇的暴雨连连的情况下，境内五条河被控制得没有发生水灾，又获得了秋季大丰收。
  时间考验了安国，安国胜利了；右倾机会主义者的诽谤考验了安国，安国胜利了；
    自然灾害考验了安国，安国胜利了。于是，人们透过安国的胜利，看到了安国人的英雄面貌，从英雄的安国人民身上，认识了安国精神。
    安国精神，是革命的坚定性和勇往直前的大无畏精神。安国人有革命的硬骨头，决不向一切困难和非难低头。安国的同志们只听党的话，而不听其他一切闲言闲语；安国的同志们只相信群众的力量，而不相信其他一切困难和障碍的力量。安国的同志们认定了方向，就带领群众勇往直前，在任何情况下决不后退，也不在革命的道路上“扭秧歌”。
    安国，是党的总路线的骄子，是大跃进的精华。安国的同志们说：我们一心一意就是要迅速改变农村一穷二白的面貌；我们一心一意就是要鼓足干劲力争上游多快好省地进行建设。安国的同志们说：我们的想法，有的对也有的不对；作法有些好也有些不好，但有一点是肯定的：我们始终都高举着党的总路线的红旗，始终用毛主席的指示来检查自己：对的就一定坚持，不对的就改掉。在这个路线上我们毫不动摇。
    随着党的八届八中全会精神的发扬，安国精神也正扩展开来。在安国四周，学安国，赶安国，如今已形成一个广泛的群众性运动了。涿县有一个一直被认为落后的小村，几年来耕作方法一直没有多少变化。今年变了。在安国精神激荡下，他们搞起大面积的丰产方来，而且要决心超过安国。这些精神是可贵的。这是安国精神的反射，也是这些地区内在的革命精神的激发。
    人们，到安国来看一看吧，看到安国的土地，是一种美的享受；接触到安国的人，会受到安国精神的感染和熏陶。
