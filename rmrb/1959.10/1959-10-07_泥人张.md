    Clay Figure Zhang
    is one of the short documentaries shown during the National Day's 10th Anniversary Domestic New Film Exhibition Month. It introduces the clay sculpture masterpieces of Zhang Mingshan ("Clay Figure Zhang"), a Tianjin clay sculpture artist from the late 19th century, and his four generations of successors, as well as their vastly different experiences in the old and new societies. This wonderful flower of clay sculpture was buried in the old society, but the new society has cultivated it into a fruitful result. This photo shows the work of the fourth generation of "Clay Figure Zhang" - the Leather Worker. See how vividly he portrays the expressions and postures of the leather worker.

    泥人张
    是庆祝建国十周年国产新片展览月展出的短纪录片之一。它介绍了我国十九世纪末天津泥塑艺术家张明山（“泥人张”）以下四代的泥塑杰作，以及他们在新旧社会迥然不同的遭遇。泥塑这朵奇葩被旧社会埋没了，新社会却把它培育出了硕果。这张照片拍的就是“泥人张”第四代的作品——皮匠。你看他把皮匠工作的神情姿态，刻划得多么维妙维肖。
