Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Washington dispatch: The Central Treaty Organization Council meeting opened in Washington, the US capital, on the 7th amidst "Cold War" clamoring by US government leaders.

This is the first time this aggressive military bloc has held a Council meeting in its "non-member country" – the United States, and it is also its first ministerial meeting since its main Middle Eastern pillar, Iraq, formally withdrew and it changed its name from the "Baghdad Pact" to the "Central Treaty Organization." Attending the meeting were Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal, Pakistani Foreign Minister Qadir, British Ambassador to the United States Caccia, and US Secretary of State Herter as an "observer." The meeting is scheduled to last for three days.

US Vice President Nixon, in his opening address on the morning of the 7th, repeated the US's customary "Cold War" rhetoric, insisting that since the war, "International communism has constantly taken probing actions in an attempt to impose its ideology and its rule on others." Although it is the United States itself that is engaging in subversion everywhere in the Middle East, Nixon solemnly clamored again about the "threat" of subversive activities. He demanded that the Middle Eastern member states of this military bloc not be influenced by the trend towards easing the situation caused by Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and clamored that they must not "relax their efforts." He stated that the United States would continue to strongly support the Central Treaty Organization.

Herter, in his speech, continued to slander that there were communist "attempts" to "undermine" the security and independence of Middle Eastern countries, and he also emphasized that the United States would continue to strongly support this military bloc, and demanded that the Central Treaty Organization "accelerate the pace of its activities."

Central Treaty Organization Secretary-General Baig (Pakistan), in his speech, followed the will of the imperialists and also clamored about communist "aggression against the free world" and "subversive activities."

Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, in his speech, demanded the establishment of a headquarters within this military bloc, and that it "will become the main military organization at a certain time."

As with past meetings of this group, on economic issues, the United States and Britain sang different tunes from their Asian allies.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Washington dispatch: According to a statement issued by Central Treaty Organization Secretary-General Baig in Washington on the 8th, the United States will strengthen its control over the military institutions of this aggressive military bloc next year.

He said that the Central Treaty Organization Council decided at a closed-door meeting held on the 8th that the chairman of the military committee of this military bloc will be an American next year, and the chief of staff of the group's newly established permanent military representatives group will also be a US major general. The permanent military representatives group is scheduled to begin operations on January 1 next year in Ankara, the capital of Turkey.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Washington dispatch: The Central Treaty Organization concluded its three-day Council meeting in Washington on the 9th. The meeting issued a communiqué filled with "Cold War" rhetoric and a venomous "declaration" slandering the Soviet Union.

The communiqué clamored that the member states of this aggressive military bloc should "maintain their strength." It slandered that "the activities of the Communists have not diminished" and are a "long-standing source of disquiet." Although a major activity of this military bloc in the Middle East is to try every means to subvert those governments that resolutely maintain national independence, the communiqué also clamored about the "threat of subversion." It could not erase the huge impact of Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and therefore had to acknowledge that mutual visits between the heads of government of the United States and the Soviet Union "brought the possibility of some easing of Cold War tensions closer."

The communiqué announced that the military bloc's newly established "Permanent Military Representatives Group" will begin operations in Ankara on January 1 next year. The issue of establishing a "headquarters organization" will be studied by the military committee and submitted to the next Council meeting held in Tehran.

The communiqué also announced that three projects will be carried out in Turkey, namely the expansion of the Black Sea port of Trabzon near the Soviet Union and the Mediterranean port of Iskenderun near the Syrian region, and the construction of a new Kizile-Hakkari-Siirt highway in southeastern Turkey near Iraq.

　　美国进一步控制侵略中东的军事集团
    中央条约组织会上充斥冷战声
    增设军事机构美国独揽军权
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：中央条约组织理事会会议7日在美国政府领导人的“冷战”叫嚷声中，在美国首都华盛顿开幕。
    这是这个侵略军事集团第一次在它的“非成员国”——美国举行理事会会议，也是它自从它的中东主要支柱伊拉克正式退出和它从“巴格达条约”改名为“中央条约组织”以后的第一次部长级会议。出席会议的有土耳其总理曼德列斯、伊朗首相埃格巴尔、巴基斯坦外交部长卡迪尔、英国驻美国大使加西亚和作为“观察员”的美国国务卿赫脱。会议预定举行三天。
    美国副总统尼克松在7日上午开幕式上致词时，重复了美国惯用的“冷战”腔调，硬说战后以来，“国际共产主义一直不断地采取试探行动，企图把它的意识形态和它的统治强加于人。”尽管在中东到处搞颠覆活动的就是美国自己，尼克松却煞有介事地又在叫嚷颠覆活动的“威胁”。他要求这个军事集团的中东成员国不要受赫鲁晓夫访问美国所造成的趋向缓和局势的影响，叫嚷不能“放松努力”。他表示美国将继续大力支持中央条约组织。
    赫脱在讲话时，继续诬蔑有什么共产党“破坏”中东国家的安全和独立的“企图”，他也强调美国将继续大力支持这个军事集团，并且要求中央条约组织“加速活动的步伐”。
    中央条约组织秘书长贝格（巴基斯坦）在致词时，秉承帝国主义者的意志，也叫嚷什么共产党“对自由世界的侵略”和“颠覆活动”。
    土耳其总理曼德列斯在讲话时，要求在这个军事集团内成立一个司令部，并且它“到一定时候将成为主要军事组织”。
    这次会议同这个集团的过去会议一样，在经济问题上，美国和英国同它们的亚洲盟国唱着不同的调子。
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息，据中央条约组织秘书长贝格8日在华盛顿发表的谈话透露，美国在明年将加强对这个侵略军事集团的军事机构的控制。
    他说，中央条约组织理事会在8日举行的秘密会议上决定，这个军事集团的军事委员会主席明年将由一个美国人担任，这个集团新设立的常设军事代表小组的参谋长也将由一个美国少将担任，常设军事代表小组预定明年1月1日在土耳其首都安卡拉开始活动。
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：中央条约组织9日在华盛顿结束了它为时三天的理事会会议。会议发表了一项充满“冷战”腔调的公报和一篇恶毒诬蔑苏联的“宣言”。
    公报叫嚷这个侵略军事集团的成员国要“保持它们的实力”。它诬蔑“共产党的活动仍未减少”是“由来已久的令人不安的根源”。尽管这个军事集团在中东的一个主要活动就是千方百计地颠覆那些坚决维护民族独立的政府，这个公报竟然也叫嚷“颠覆的威胁”。它无法抹煞赫鲁晓夫访问美国所造成的巨大影响，因此也不得不承认美苏两国政府首脑互访“使冷战紧张局势得到某种缓和的可能性更为接近了”。
    公报宣布，这个军事集团新设立的“常设军事代表小组”将在明年1月1日在安卡拉开始活动。关于成立“司令部机构”的问题将由军事委员会研究提交在德黑兰举行的下届理事会会议。
    公报还宣布将在土耳其进行三项工程，即扩建靠近苏联的黑海港口特拉布松和靠近叙利亚地区的地中海港口伊斯肯德伦，以及在靠近伊拉克的土耳其东南部建造一条吉兹勒—哈卡里—西韦兰新公路。
