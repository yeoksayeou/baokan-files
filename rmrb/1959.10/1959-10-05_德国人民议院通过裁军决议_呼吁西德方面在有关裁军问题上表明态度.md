Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 3rd - The German Democratic Republic's People's Chamber passed a resolution on the 1st, stating: "The People's Chamber welcomes the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and fully agrees with the reasons presented by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, for this proposal." The resolution also calls on the West German Bundestag, West German political parties, and organizations to state their position on the following issues:

	I. Both German states should demand an immediate halt to all nuclear weapons testing and should prohibit such tests. They should guarantee that they will not participate in or endorse such tests conducted by any country.

	II. Both German states should renounce nuclear armament and should guarantee that they will not produce nuclear, chemical, or bacteriological weapons on their territory or elsewhere, and that they will not participate in the production or acquisition of such weapons from other countries.
	Both German states should express their willingness to participate in the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.

	III. Both German states should agree to an immediate cessation of arms production. They should reach an agreement on reducing armed forces and armaments after the cessation of arms production, as well as on the deployment of these forces. Both German states should renounce conscription and should guarantee that they will maintain their military strength solely through voluntary registration.
	Both German states should regard the limitation of their armed forces as a contribution to complete disarmament.

	IV. Both German states should demand the gradual withdrawal of troops of third countries stationed on their territory and should abolish foreign military bases concurrently with the withdrawal of foreign troops.

	V. Both German states should support the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty.

	VI. Both German states should guarantee that they will take the necessary measures on their own territory to prevent any form of war propaganda, territorial claims, or expressions of hatred towards other countries.

	VII. Both German states should agree to the formation of an all-German committee on an equal basis, composed of members of both German governments, which will carry out the following tasks:
	1. Issues related to the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany;
	2. Expanding and developing contacts between the two German states;
	3. Creating conditions for the reunification of Germany.

	VIII. In order to review the implementation of measures agreed upon by the all-German committee, a supervisory body should be established, which should include representatives of the governments, parliaments, parties, trade unions, and other democratic organizations of the two German states.

The People's Chamber expresses its willingness to discuss each of the above points separately or to discuss other proposals serving the same purpose. It also expresses the hope that all German people will study the Soviet proposals without prejudice, and that a broad discussion will be held on the issue of halting armament in Germany as a step towards easing tensions.

    德国人民议院通过裁军决议
    呼吁西德方面在有关裁军问题上表明态度
    新华社柏林3日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院1日通过一项决议说：“人民议院表示欢迎苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，并且完全同意苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫为这个建议所提出的理由。”决议还呼吁西德联邦议院、西德政党和组织在下列问题上表明态度：
    一、两个德国应当要求立即停止一切核武器试验，而且应当禁止进行这种试验。它们应当保证不参加这种试验或者不赞成任何国家所进行的这种试验。
    二、两个德国应该放弃原子武装，它们应该保证不在它们的领土上及其他任何地方生产核武器、化学武器和细菌武器，不参加生产或从其他国家取得这种武器。
    两个德国应当表示愿意参加在中欧建立无原子区。
    三、两个德国应当赞同立即停止军备生产。它们应该就在停止军备生产之后减少武装部队和军备数量以及关于这些部队的部署问题达成协议。两个德国应该放弃征兵，并且应该保证自己仅仅是通过志愿登记的方法来保持它们的军事力量。
    两个德国应当将限制它们的武装力量看成是对全面裁军的一种贡献。
    四、两个德国应该要求逐步撤走驻扎在它们领土上的第三国军队，应当在撤走外国军队的同时，取消外国军事基地。
    五、两个德国应该支持缔结北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国之间的互不侵犯条约。
    六、两个德国应当保证在自己的领土上采取必要的措施，来防止任何形式的战争宣传、领土要求或者对其他国家表示仇恨。
    七、两个德国应当赞同在两个德国对等的基础上，由两个德国政府的成员组成全德委员会，这个委员会将执行以下的几项任务：
    1、有关准备和缔结对德和约的问题；
    2、扩大和发展两个德国之间的接触；
    3、为德国的重新统一创造条件。
    八、为了审查经全德委员会同意的措施的执行情况，应当设立一个监察机构，这个机构应当包括两个德国的政府、议会、党派、工会和其他民主组织的代表。
    人民议院表示愿意分别讨论上述各点或者商讨关于为同样目的服务的其他建议。它还表示希望全德国人民毫无偏见地研究苏联的建议，并且希望在德国停止武装的问题上进行广泛讨论，作为缓和紧张局势的一个步骤。
