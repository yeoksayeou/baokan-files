Mobilize the Masses, Oppose Rightward Deviation, and Achieve Overall Great Leap Forward:
Shandong Institute of Technology Takes on a New Look

    Jinan, October 26th (This newspaper) — After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all teachers, students, and staff of Shandong Institute of Technology recognized the current situation of continued great leap forward and quickly took action. The entire institute has formed a vigorous and overall great leap forward new atmosphere.

    After the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the entire institute enthusiastically studied them and used the spirit of the documents to examine various right-leaning and conservative ideas. Criticisms were made against the right-leaning and conservative ideas of a few people who believed that carrying out mass movements in institutions of higher learning would reduce teaching quality and scientific research level, as well as the sense of inferiority to varying degrees that still existed among a few teachers and students. Last year, as a result of vigorously carrying out mass movements, this institute achieved a great harvest in scientific research. From August to December of last year alone, it completed 146 scientific research projects, more than three times the total number of projects completed in the past six years. These facts, after recollection and comparison, played a great educational role for teachers and students. In the past, the Cartography Teaching and Research Group excessively emphasized objective reasons such as the small number of people and weak strength, and the teaching conditions were not as good as other advanced institutions, and there was insufficient consideration for subjective efforts, so the work did not improve. After studying, the sense of inferiority was eliminated, and the situation quickly changed. On average, each two people wrote a reading report, scientific research also became active, and they also cooperated with other teaching and research groups to design an "ultrasonic processing machine tool". Some people had slack emotions such as "take a break", which have also been transformed after studying, and a new situation of making great efforts and overall great leap forward has emerged.

    Now, major changes have taken place in all aspects of Shandong Institute of Technology. Due to the mobilization of the masses, scientific research has once again shown a thriving and beautiful atmosphere. As of the eve of National Day, the entire institute had completed 38 academic papers, exceeding the original plan of 21 by more than 80%. In the trial production of new products and the research and experimentation of new technologies, 54 projects have also been completed, all of which serve current production and are closely integrated with teaching and scientific research. Many of these projects have reached or approached the advanced domestic level.

    In accordance with the Party's policies and the requirements of the education plan, each department has further arranged students' productive labor. In addition to adhering to decentralized and regular agricultural labor, new labor bases have also been planned and expanded, and concentrated labor time has been arranged. The third-year students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering humbly learned from the workers in their work and actively participated in labor. In twenty days, they produced twenty-six kinds of products with a total value of more than 20,000 yuan. Students from the Department of Metal Technology who went to the Luoyang First Tractor Factory for internship put forward more than 1,100 rationalization proposals, some of which have been adopted by the factory. Recently, the entire institute organized a labor army of 1,500 people to go to Changqing County to support the commune's autumn plowing and wheat planting in accordance with the labor plan.

    At the same time, each teaching and research group has made many improvements to every link of teaching: lesson preparation, lecturing, experiments, production practice, exercise classes, and course design. In the case of many new majors and few teachers, the teachers worked hard to overcome difficulties and opened many new courses. They have completed the compilation of 25 kinds of teaching materials and lecture notes, changing the past situation of preparing experiments only when they were needed. The Department of Metal Technology has successively opened 34 new experiments this semester, all of which are pre-assigned to be responsible for preparation, which improves the quality of teaching. A good atmosphere of serious teaching and reading has been established among teachers and students in the whole institute. Party members took the lead in reading, and students widely carried out reading report activities around current classroom learning, experiments, course design, and scientific research projects. Before the National Day, 173 reading reports had been completed. By writing reading reports, the academic atmosphere was further enlivened and the improvement of teachers' professional level was promoted.

    At present, Shandong Institute of Technology is showing an atmosphere of infinite good situation and a great leap forward with new climaxes every day. All teachers, students, and staff are full of vigor, continue to oppose rightward deviation, encourage hard work, implement the Party's education policy, and dedicate more outstanding achievements to the New Year's Day.

    发动群众　反掉右倾　全面跃进
    山东工学院气象一新
    本报济南26日电　山东工学院全体师生员工学习党的八届八中全会文件后，认清了当前继续跃进的形势，迅速行动起来。全院形成一个生气蓬勃全面跃进的新气象。
    党的八届八中全会文件公布后，全院即热烈学习，用文件的精神来检查各种右倾保守思想。对少数人认为在高等学校里搞群众运动会降低教学质量和科学研究水平，以及少数教师学生仍存在不同程度的自卑感等右倾保守思想，进行了批判。这个学院在去年由于大搞群众运动的结果，科学研究上获得了大丰收，仅去年8月至12月就完成了一百四十六个科学研究项目，比过去六年所完成的项目总和还多三倍。经过回忆对比，这些事实，对师生们起了很大的教育作用。制图教研组过去过份强调人少力量单薄，师资条件不如其它先进院校好等客观原因，对主观努力考虑不够，因此工作没有起色，经过学习，打掉了自卑感，情况很快转变，平均每两人就写了一篇读书报告，科学研究也活跃起来了，还与别的教研组合作设计了“超声波加工机床”。有些人有“歇一歇”等松劲情绪，经过学习，也已转变过来，出现了大干一场全面跃进的新局面。
    现在，山东工学院各方面都起了重大变化。科学研究由于发动群众，再度出现欣欣向荣的美好气象，到国庆前夕为止，全院已完成学术论文三十八篇，超过了原来二十一篇的计划80％多。在新产品的试制和新工艺的研究试验方面，也完成了五十四项，都是服务于当前生产并和教学科学研究密切结合的。这些项目，不少已达到或接近国内先进水平。
    各系根据党的方针和教育计划的要求，进一步安排了学生的生产劳动，除坚持分散的和经常性的农业劳动以外，还筹建和扩建了新的劳动基地，安排了集中劳动的时间。机械系三年级同学在劳动中虚心向工人学习，积极参加劳动，在二十天中生产了二十六种产品，产值达两万多元。金属工艺系去洛阳第一拖拉机厂实习的同学，提出了一千一百余条合理化建议，一部分已被工厂采纳。最近，全院组织了一支一千五百名的劳动大军，按照劳动计划开赴长清县支援公社秋耕种麦。
    与此同时，各教研组对教学的每一环节：备课、讲课、实验、生产实习、习题课、课程设计等都作了许多改进。在新专业多、师资少的情况下，教师们努力克服困难，开出了许多新课，已经完成二十五种教材和讲义的编写工作，改变了过去现作实验现准备的状态。金属工艺系在本学期陆续开出三十四个新实验，都事先指定专人负责准备，提高了教学质量。全院师生中树立了认真教书、读书的风气。党员带头读书，同学们围绕当前的课堂学习、实验、课程设计、科学研究项目，广泛地开展了读书报告活动，在国庆前已完成读书报告一百七十三篇，通过写读书报告，也进一步活跃了学术空气，促进了教师业务水平的提高。
    目前，山东工学院到处呈现出一片形势无限好、高潮日日新的跃进气氛，全院师生员工意气风发，继续反右倾、鼓干劲、贯彻党的教育方针，以更优异的成果向元旦献礼。（附图片）
