　　Bringing Back Something from Beijing
    That is New Drive!
    Early on the 8th, Wang Tonglun came to the workshop to work.
    This veteran lathe operator with thirty-five years of experience, a worker engineer at Zhongtian Electric Motor Factory, has been working on a belt-driven lathe, never producing a single defective product in ten years, and exceeding his monthly plan every month. He had just returned from Beijing after attending the National Day celebration. As soon as he stepped into the tool workshop, everyone surrounded him, bombarding him with questions: Did you see Chairman Mao? Did you see the grand buildings in Beijing? What advanced experiences did you learn?
    Master Wang smiled and said: There are many things I want to talk to you about! In a nutshell, we still have to muster our energy. I'll tell you the details after work tonight, how about we start working now?
    Knowing that he was a worker who had just returned last night, they advised him to rest and come to work tomorrow.
    He pulled this worker to his side and whispered: I'll tell you a secret, I only brought one thing back from Beijing this time for more than ten days, and that is a new drive. Do you think I can rest for a day before going to work?
    That day, coincidentally, there was no electricity in the workshop. He was making a 1,120-millimeter-long pressure mold for a plastic factory. Unable to use the lathe, he used hand tools to ream holes and grind them round.
    That evening, the workshop held a welcome party for Master Wang. He was known in the factory as someone who didn't like to talk, but that night, he talked a lot and was very excited. He said: "I am already fifty years old, and I never thought I would see airplanes, tanks, and cars produced by China itself, and attend meetings in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. I never dreamed of such things in the past! These are all brilliant achievements made by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Although I was invited to watch the ceremony, when I think of my own achievements, I am like a grain of rice in the ocean, very small. So when I was in Beijing, I wanted to come back quickly and produce more and better things. Now I guarantee to everyone that I will definitely carry out more technical innovations, train apprentices well, and better complete production tasks."
    Everyone welcomed Master Wang's new drive with thunderous applause and also expressed their determination. In this way, the next day, a production upsurge to welcome the convening of the National Congress of Heroes was launched. (Deping)

　　从北京带回来一样东西
    那就是新的干劲！
    8日一早，王同伦就到车间来上班了。
    这位已经有三十五年工龄的老车工、中天电机厂的工人工程师，在一台皮带车床上干活，十年没出次品，并且月月超额完成计划。他到北京参加国庆节观礼刚刚回来，一踏进工具车间，大家就把他围起来了，七嘴八舌地提出了许多问题：见到毛主席了吗？看了北京的大建筑了吗？学来了什么先进经验？
    王师傅笑了笑，说：要跟大伙谈的事多着呢！一句话，我们还得鼓足干劲。详细情形，晚上下班再谈，现在开始干活好不好？
    知道他是昨天晚上才回来的工人，劝他休息一下，明天再干。
    他把这个工人拉到自己的身边，小声地说：告诉你一个秘密，我这一次去北京十几天，就带回一个东西，那就是新的干劲，你想，我能歇一天才上班吗？
    这一天，碰巧车间里没有电。他给塑料厂做一千一百二十毫米长的压力模子，没法用车床干，他就用手工掏眼、磨圆。
    当天晚上，车间为王师傅举办了个欢迎会。他在厂里是有名的不爱说话的人，可是这天晚上，他谈得非常多，也很激动。他说：“我已经是五十岁的人了，想不到还看见中国自己出产的飞机、坦克、汽车，到那么壮丽的人民大会堂开会，过去真是做梦也想不到呀！这都是全国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下取得的辉煌成就。我自己虽然被邀观礼，可是想起自己的成绩，真像大海里一颗米粒一样，小得很。所以在北京的时候，我就想快些回来，生产出更多更好的东西来。现在我向大家保证，一定要多搞技术革新，带好徒弟，更好地完成生产任务。”
    大家以暴风雨般的掌声，欢迎王师傅的新的干劲，也表示了自己的决心。就这样，第二天一个迎接全国群英会召开的生产高潮又掀了起来。　　（德平）
