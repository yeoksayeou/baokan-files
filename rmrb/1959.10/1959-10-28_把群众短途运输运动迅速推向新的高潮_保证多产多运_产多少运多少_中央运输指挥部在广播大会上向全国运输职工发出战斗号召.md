Xinhua News Agency, October 27th – "Use more transport to guarantee high production, transport as much as is produced, transport immediately after production, seize every second, leave not an ounce behind." This is the call to arms issued to national transportation workers at today's National Short-Distance Transportation Radio Conference. This radio conference was held to rapidly push the mass short-distance transportation movement, which is vigorously unfolding across the country, to a new climax, and strive to complete this year's transportation plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.

The radio conference was jointly convened by the Central Transportation Headquarters and the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo attended today's radio conference and spoke at the meeting. He first elaborated on the very good situation of the current national economy as a whole, and then pointed out that strengthening transportation work, especially doing a good job in short-distance transportation work, is a key issue on the current economic front. The implementation of the policy of "walking on two legs" in my country's industrial production, the output of "small native groups," "small foreign groups," and some "medium foreign groups" is very large, and most of the transportation volume of these products must be added to short-distance transportation; coupled with the transportation of agricultural products, supplies for the market, and bricks, tiles, sand, and stones needed for large-scale water conservancy and capital construction, this further increases the task of short-distance transportation. Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that according to incomplete statistics, more than seven million people and a large number of folk transport tools have been invested in this movement, which has greatly improved the capacity of short-distance transportation, transported many industrial production, urban supply, export, etc. required materials, and consolidated a large number of goods for trunk line transportation, thus further enlivening the urban and rural economy. The current task is to consolidate the climax of the mass short-distance transportation movement that has already been formed, and to develop it more widely, more comprehensively, and more deeply and continuously.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that in vigorously developing the mass movement of short-distance transportation, we must attach importance to and make full use of folk transport tools, and vigorously carry out technological innovation of folk transport tools. At the same time, we must also pay attention to transportation construction, adopt the principle of adapting to local conditions and using local materials according to terrain and natural geographical conditions, actively improve transportation conditions, enhance transportation capacity, and build a short-distance transportation network. The factories and mining enterprises of "small foreign groups" and "small native groups" in various places should improve internal transportation conditions, do a good job in transportation work, and promote production.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that in carrying out the mass short-distance transportation, we should vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation. Various means of transportation should have a better division of labor and be organically combined. Through the mass movement of short-distance transportation, the professional transportation teams and sideline transportation teams of the people's communes should be organized, consolidated, and strengthened.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo finally said that my country's national economy is currently in an all-round leap forward, which requires transportation work to catch up. Therefore, the transportation task is very heavy, but also very glorious. To complete the current heavy short-distance transportation task, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen political and ideological work, all right-leaning thoughts must be thoroughly criticized, and revolutionary vigor must be fully aroused. He called on the national transportation workers to hold high the red flag of the General Line, vigorously carry out mass movements, and make even greater and more outstanding achievements on the transportation and short-distance transportation front.

Wang Shoudao, Deputy Commander of the Central Transportation Headquarters and Minister of Communications, gave a report on the current situation on the transportation front, the tasks of transportation work, and the measures to complete the tasks. Wang Shoudao said that since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers on the transportation front have overcome the difficulties caused by various natural disasters with great political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm, and the volume of transportation has risen rapidly. From January to September this year, the total freight volume completed by various transportation modes such as water transport, road transport, and civil aviation across the country increased by about 40% compared with the same period last year; the largest increase was in September this year, which was 31% higher than in August, and a greater increase is expected in October. Especially after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on launching a mass short-distance transportation movement in mid-September, a large-scale mass movement quickly unfolded, and has recently entered a climax, and the situation of short-distance transportation has greatly improved. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-one provinces and autonomous regions, the number of people participating in short-distance transportation has now exceeded seven million, with 3.58 million vehicles of various types, nearly 100,000 wooden sailboats, and more than 480,000 draft animals. Therefore, the volume of transportation completed by localities in September increased by 27% compared with August, and the materials backlog awaiting transportation at the end of September decreased by 35% compared with the end of August. Wang Shoudao said that the characteristics of the current mass movement of short-distance transportation are: great enthusiasm, good organization, both vigorous and down-to-earth. This shows that this year's mass movement is developing better, more comprehensively, and more healthily on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward.

Wang Shoudao said that the achievements in transportation are affirmative, but the current transportation, especially short-distance transportation, still cannot meet the needs of the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The central task of the transportation front at present is: to use more transport to guarantee high production, transport as much as is produced, transport immediately after production, seize every second, leave not an ounce behind, and strive to complete this year's transportation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, and make all preparations for continuing the leap forward next year. All employees on the transportation front must thoroughly criticize right-leaning thoughts, muster up their energy, and do everything possible to achieve daily red, monthly red, and full red on the transportation front; all accumulated coal, ore, pig iron, wood, mica, asbestos, etc. awaiting transportation must be completely transported out through shock; the procurement, sales, and transfer tasks of autumn grain, cotton, oil, and agricultural and sideline specialty products must be completed in a timely manner; in particular, the collection and transportation tasks of export goods for foreign trade must be completed quickly; and perishable products such as sugar beets and sugarcane must be actively rushed for transportation.

When talking about the measures to ensure the completion of this year's transportation plan ahead of schedule, Wang Shoudao said: First, implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on launching a mass short-distance transportation movement. According to needs and possibilities, professional and sideline transportation teams based on production teams should be organized in the people's communes. After the transportation teams are organized, they should vigorously increase transportation tools to improve transportation efficiency and save labor. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish necessary management systems. Second, strengthen transportation organization and management work, rationally utilize various transportation tools, give full play to the efficiency of various transportation tools, and pay attention to safe production, labor organization and arrangements, and the combination of work and rest. Third, vigorously carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, improve transportation conditions, and set off a climax of transportation construction such as building roads, dredging rivers, building vehicles and ships, and improving vehicles and ships in winter, laying a favorable foundation for the continued leap forward in transportation next year. This year's capital construction in various places should accelerate the construction speed and ensure the quality of the project; the new vehicles, ships, ports, equipment, etc. added this year should strive to be put into production as early as possible to quickly expand transportation capacity. Fourth, strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously promote various "one-dragon" transportation cooperation. Wang Shoudao finally pointed out that after the mass movement of short-distance transportation rises, a large number of materials will inevitably be pressed on trunk line transportation. Therefore, the employees of trunk line transportation enterprises such as water transport, road transport, and civil aviation should actively cooperate with the mass movement of short-distance transportation, and carry out the current increase in production and savings more deeply, widely, and comprehensively, so as to achieve high yield, high quality, high efficiency, low consumption, low cost, and safe production. Strive to exceed the completion of this year's transportation task and strive for a continued leap forward next year.

Zhang Bangying, Deputy Minister of the Transportation Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Ruilong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, also attended today's conference and spoke.

After clarifying the important significance of carrying out the mass short-distance transportation movement in his speech, Zhang Bangying said that the experience of various places proves that to complete the short-distance transportation task, the strength of state-owned and transportation cooperatives must be combined with the transportation strength of the people's communes. To run transportation well, the people's communes must combine the organization of professional transportation teams with the mobilization of the masses for temporary shock during agricultural gaps. He said that at present, more than half of the communes in many provinces have set up professional transportation teams, with a total of more than 2 million people participating, which has become an indispensable and huge force in the current short-distance transportation.

Zhang Bangying said that running professional transportation teams in communes not only alleviated the tense situation of short-distance transportation, but also brought great benefits to the communes: First, the commune's cash crops, industrial and sideline products, especially melons, fruits, and vegetables, can be transported out in a timely manner, and the fertilizers, fuels, raw materials, daily necessities, etc. needed by the commune can be supplied in a timely manner; second, the labor force occupied by the commune in transportation is greatly reduced, and transportation efficiency is increased by one or several times; third, the commune is able to arrange agricultural activities easily, and no longer disrupt the allocation plan of labor and animal power in each production team due to frequent temporary dispatch of vehicles and boats for transportation; fourth, the commune can often receive a considerable amount of freight, which solves many production and living expenses of the commune; fifth, during the busy agricultural season, the commune's professional transportation team is also a shock force on field transportation. Many people praised the commune's operation of professional transportation as "a great good thing that benefits the country and the whole commune." He asked Party committees and transportation departments at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the commune's professional transportation teams, so that it can develop solidly and strive to complete the short-distance transportation task quickly, well, and economically.

Yuan Chunfang, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation, Wang Changyu, Deputy Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation, and Li Qianyi, Deputy Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation, successively spoke at the meeting, introducing the momentum, experience, and gains of the vigorous mass short-distance transportation movement in these three provinces.

Yuan Chunfang said that since September, Henan Province has rapidly organized a massive and magnificent mass short-distance transportation movement. The province mobilized more than 600,000 people every day to engage in transportation and transportation construction while the "Three Autumns" work, drought resistance and wheat planting, and industrial and agricultural production were very tense. From October 1st to 20th, the province's completed freight volume increased by 27.17% compared with the same period in September, and more than 10,000 kilometers of simple railways were built; a large number of rivers were dredged, nearly 1,000 kilometers of new waterways and water conservancy canals were developed; more than 8,000 kilometers of highways were repaired; and many vehicles, ships, and loading and unloading tools were repaired and manufactured, which greatly improved transportation conditions and powerfully supported the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Wang Changyu said that the short-distance transportation team in Jiangxi Province has reached more than 600,000 people, and the amount of short-distance materials transported in the past month is nearly 2 million tons. He said that there are three reasons for the vigorous development of the mass short-distance transportation movement in Jiangxi Province: First, adhere to the leadership of the Party, the secretary takes the lead, and fully mobilize the masses. Second, long-distance trunk line transportation and short-distance transportation, modern transportation and folk transportation are carried out simultaneously, and various transportation tools are comprehensively utilized according to local conditions, and various transportation potentials are tapped in every possible way. Third, implement the "walking on two legs" policy, and in accordance with the principles of "adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," vigorously engage in transportation construction, and vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution of transportation tools to improve transportation efficiency.

In his speech, Li Qianyi talked about the five major benefits of carrying out the mass movement of shock short-distance transportation in Hunan Province: First, it has unblocked rural transportation and transported out a large number of materials that have been accumulated for a long time, which is greatly conducive to production. Second, it has enlivened the urban and rural economy, increased the income of the commune, and promoted market prosperity. Third, it has expanded transportation construction and improved transportation conditions. Fourth, it has consolidated the transportation team and strengthened the command organization. Fifth, it has concentrated abundant sources of goods for long-distance trunk line transportation, so that modern transportation tools can better complete the state plan.

In the nationwide magnificent mass short-distance transportation movement, Changli County in Hebei, Licheng County in Shanxi, Wuxian County in Jiangsu, and Junxian County in Henan have all created good experiences. The leaders of these four counties specially rushed to participate in today's conference to introduce their experiences.

Wang Huofu, Secretary of the Licheng County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, said that the transportation volume in Licheng County this year is equal to four times that of 1958. Because the whole county's communes run transportation, the districts run transportation, and the rural transportation tools are organized to connect transportation, a well-connected short-distance transportation network has been formed in the whole county, and the transportation plan from January to September this year has been successfully completed, and the annual transportation plan will also be completed ahead of schedule. The county has achieved no stagnation of commercial materials, no accumulation of industrial raw materials, promoted the production of local specialties, and increased the income of the masses.

Guo Zhenqin, Secretary of the Junxian County Party Committee of Henan Province, said that Junxian County combined the realization of water conservancy, relied on the masses to vigorously develop river network, and vigorously developed water transportation. In the past year, a total of four new major routes have been opened, plus the original waterways, with a total length of more than 200 kilometers; more than 1,300 kilometers of navigable channels in the fields have been developed; nine shipyards have been established, and 158 ships of various types have been built; the county's ten townships have achieved township-to-township access to canals, and eight townships have access to navigation, forming a new situation of crisscrossing major and minor routes and well-connected water transportation. He said that the benefits of developing water transportation are: small investment and large returns, large transportation volume and quick results, low freight and high income, and can save a large amount of labor, livestock power, and fuel.

Today, more than 6 million employees of water, land, and air transportation departments and enterprises, stations, ports, and airports, people's commune transportation stations, and ships sailing on the coast and inland rivers across the country, waited at the radio and loudspeakers to listen to the live broadcast of the conference. During the more than three hours of the conference, they sent telegrams and long-distance calls to the conference, reporting their latest achievements in the transportation work posts, expressing their determination and confidence in completing this year's transportation plan ahead of schedule. The reporting teams of four transportation units in Beijing, beating gongs and drums, and dancing lions and dragons, sent a batch of production good news into the central venue of the conference.

    把群众短途运输运动迅速推向新的高潮
    保证多产多运　产多少运多少
    中央运输指挥部在广播大会上向全国运输职工发出战斗号召
    新华社27日讯　“以多运保高产，产多少、运多少，随产随运，分秒必争，斤两不留。”这是今天举行的全国短途运输广播大会，向全国交通运输职工发出的战斗号召。这次广播大会，是为了把正在全国蓬勃展开的群众短途运输运动迅速推向新的高潮，力争提前和超额完成今年的运输计划而召开的。
    广播大会是由中央运输指挥部和中央人民广播电台联合召开的。
    国务院副总理薄一波参加了今天的广播大会，并且在会上讲了话。他首先阐述了目前整个国民经济非常好的形势，接着指出，加强交通运输工作，特别是搞好短途运输工作，是当前经济战线上的一个关键问题。我国工业生产两条腿走路的方针的贯彻执行，“小土群”、“小洋群”和部分“中洋群”的产量很大，这些产品大部分的运输量都要加在短途运输身上；再加上农产品、供应市场的物资和大修水利、基本建设所需要的砖、瓦、砂、石等的运输，就更加重了短途运输的任务。薄一波副总理说，根据不完全的统计，目前已有七百多万人和大量的民间运输工具投入了这个运动，大大提高了短途运输的能力，运出了许多工业生产、城市供应、出口等所需要的以及长期积压的物资，为干线运输集散了大量的货物，因此，更加活跃了城乡经济。当前的任务，就是要把已经形成的短途运输群众运动的高潮，巩固起来，更加广泛、更加全面、更加深入地持续不断地发展下去。
    薄一波副总理说，大搞短途运输的群众运动，要重视和充分利用民间运输工具，并且对民间运输工具大力进行技术革新。与此同时，还要注意交通建设，根据地形和自然地理等条件，采取因地制宜，就地取材的方针，积极改善交通条件，增强运输力量，建设短途运输网。各地“小洋群”和“小土群”的厂矿企业，应当改善内部的交通条件，搞好运输工作，促进生产。
    薄一波副总理说，在开展群众短途运输中，应当大兴共产主义协作之风。各种运输工具之间，应当更好地分工，有机地结合。通过短途运输的群众运动，应当把人民公社的专业运输队和副业运输队组织巩固和壮大起来。
    薄一波副总理最后说，当前我国国民经济正在全面跃进中，它要求运输工作赶上去。因此，运输任务是十分繁重、但又是十分光荣的。要完成目前繁重的短途运输任务，必须加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作，一切右倾思想必须反透，革命干劲必须鼓足。他号召全国交通运输职工高举总路线的红旗，大搞群众运动，在交通运输和短途运输战线上，做出更加伟大更加卓越的成绩。
    中央运输指挥部副总指挥、交通部部长王首道就当前交通运输战线上的形势、运输工作的任务和完成任务的措施作了报告。王首道说，自从党的八届八中全会以来，交通运输战线上的广大职工群众，以极大的政治热情和劳动热情，战胜了各种自然灾害所造成的困难，运量迅速上升。今年1至9月份，全国水运、公路和民用航空各种运输所完成的总货运量比去年同期增长了40％左右；今年9月份增长最大，比8月份增长31％，10月份预计还有更大的增长。特别是在9月中旬，中共中央和国务院发出关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示以后，大规模的群众运动迅速展开，最近已经进入高潮，短途运输的情况大有好转。根据二十一个省、自治区的初步统计，目前参加短途运输的人数已超过七百多万人，出动各种车辆三百五十八万辆，木帆船近十万艘，驮力四十八万多头。因此，9月份地方完成的运量比8月份增长了27％，9月底各地积压待运的物资比8月底减少了35％。王首道说，当前短途运输的群众运动的特点是：干劲大，组织好，既是轰轰烈烈，又是踏踏实实。这说明今年的群众运动是在去年大跃进的基础上，更好、更全面、更健康的开展起来了。
    王首道说，交通运输方面的成绩是肯定的，但目前交通运输特别是短途运输，还满足不了工农业生产持续大跃进的需要。交通运输战线当前的中心任务是：要以多运保高产，产多少运多少，随产随运，分秒必争，斤两不留，力争提前和超额完成今年的运输任务，并为明年继续跃进作了一切准备工作。交通运输战线的全体职工们，必须反透右倾，鼓足干劲，千方百计地在交通运输战线上做到日日红、月月红、满堂红；把积存待运的煤炭、矿石、生铁、木材、云母、石棉等都全部突击运输出来；及时完成秋后粮、棉、油和农副特产品的购销调运任务；特别是抓紧完成对外贸易出口物资的集运任务；积极抢运甜菜、甘蔗等易腐产品。
    王首道在谈到保证提前完成今年运输计划的措施时说：第一，贯彻执行中共中央和国务院关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示。要根据需要和可能，在人民公社内组织好以生产队为基础的专业和副业运输队。运输队组织起来以后，要大力增加运输工具，以提高运输效率，节约劳动力。同时还要建立必要的管理制度。第二，加强运输组织管理工作，合理利用各种运输工具，充分发挥各种运输工具的效率，并且注意安全生产、劳动力的组织安排和劳逸结合。第三，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，改善交通条件，掀起冬季修建道路、疏浚河道、造车造船、改良车船等交通建设的高潮，为明年交通运输继续跃进打下有利基础。今年各地的基本建设应加快建设速度，保证工程质量；今年新增加的车、船、港口、设备等都要争取尽可能地提前投入生产，以迅速扩大运输能力。第四，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大力推广各种“一条龙”运输大协作。王首道最后指出，短途运输的群众运动起来以后，大量物资必然压向干线运输。因此，各水运、公路、民用航空等干线运输企业的职工，要积极配合短途运输群众运动，把当前的增产节约更深入、广泛、全面地开展下去，做到高产、优质、高效率、低消耗、低成本和安全生产。为超额完成今年运输任务和争取明年继续跃进而奋斗。
    中共中央交通工作部副部长张邦英、农业部副部长刘瑞龙，也参加了今天的大会并且讲了话。
    张邦英在讲话中阐明开展群众短途运输运动的重要意义之后说，各地经验证明，要完成短途运输任务，必须使国营和运输合作社的力量同人民公社的运输力量结合起来。人民公社要办好交通运输，必须把组织专业交通运输队伍同利用农隙发动群众临时大突击很好地结合起来。他说，目前许多省份已有一半以上的公社办了专业运输队，参加的人员共有二百多万人，已经成为当前短途运输上的一支不可缺少的巨大力量。
    张邦英说，公社办专业运输队，不仅缓和了短途运输的紧张局面，并且给公社带来了很大的好处：一，使公社的经济作物、工业和副业产品，特别是瓜、果、蔬菜等能够及时运出，公社所需的肥料、燃料、原料、日用品等得到及时供应；二，使公社在运输上占用的劳动力大大减少，运输效率加了一番或几番；三，使公社便于安排农事活动，不再因经常临时派车、派船搞运输而打乱各生产队劳力、畜力的调配计划；四，使公社能够经常收入相当数量的运费，解决公社许多生产和生活上的开支问题；五，农业大忙的时候，公社专业运输队又是田间运输上的一支突击力量。许多群众称赞公社办专业运输是“功在国家利在全社的大好事”。他要求各级党委和交通部门，加强对公社专业运输队的领导，使它巩固地发展，为多快好省地完成短途运输任务而奋斗。
    河南省交通厅副厅长苑春芳、江西省交通厅副厅长王昌宇、湖南省交通厅副厅长李前义，先后在会上发言，介绍了目前这三个省轰轰烈烈的群众短途运输运动的声势、经验和收获。
    苑春芳说，9月份以来，河南省迅速组织了一个声势浩大、波澜壮阔的群众短途运输运动。全省在“三秋”工作、抗旱种麦和工农业生产非常紧张的同时，每天出动六十多万人大办运输和交通建设。10月1日到20日，全省完成的货运量比9月份同期增长27.17％，还修建了简易铁路一万多公里；疏浚了大批河道，开发了近一千公里新航道和水利干渠；整修了八千多公里公路；修理制造了许多车辆、船只、装卸工具，大大改善了交通条件，有力地支援了工农业生产大跃进。
    王昌宇说，江西省短途运输队伍已达六十多万人，一个月来抢运短途物资运量近二百万吨。他说，江西省群众短途运输运动蓬勃开展有三个原因：一，坚持党的领导，书记挂帅，充分发动群众。二，长途干线运输和短途运输、现代运输与民间运输同时并举，因地制宜地综合利用各种运输工具，千方百计地挖掘运输潜力。三，贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，根据“因地制宜，就地取材，土洋结合”的原则，大搞交通建设，大闹运输工具的技术革新与技术革命，提高运输效率。
    李前义在发言中谈到了湖南省开展突击短途运输的群众运动有五大好处：一，畅通了农村运输，把过去长期积压的大批物资运了出来，大大有利于生产。二，活跃了城乡经济，增加了公社收入，促进了市场繁荣。三，扩大了交通建设，改善了运输条件。四，巩固了运输队伍，加强了指挥机构。五，为长途干线运输集中了充沛的货源，使近代化运输工具能更好地完成国家计划。
    在全国波澜壮阔的群众短途运输运动中，河北昌黎县、山西黎城县、江苏吴县和河南浚县，都创造了好的经验。这四个县的负责人特地赶来参加今天的大会，介绍了他们的经验。
    中共山西黎城县县委书记王火福说，黎城县今年的运输量，等于1958年的四倍。由于全县社社办运输、区区办运输，组织农村各种运输工具衔接运输，在全县形成了一个四通八达的短途运输网，今年1到9月的运输计划已经出色的完成，全年的运输计划也将提前完成。全县做到了商业物资无呆滞，工业原料不积压，促进了土特产的生产，增加了群众的收入。
    中共河南浚县县委书记郭振勤说，浚县结合实现水利化，依靠群众大搞河网化，大力发展水上运输。一年来共新开较大航线四条，加上原有航道，共长二百多公里；发展田间通航渠道一千三百多公里；建立船厂九座，已造各种船只一百五十八只；全县十个乡已实现了乡乡通渠、八乡通航，大小航线纵横交织，水上运输四通八达的新局面。他说，发展水上运输的好处是：投资小收益大，运量大收效快，运费低收入多，能节省大批劳力畜力和燃料。
    今天，全国各地水、陆、空交通运输部门和企业、车站、港口和机场，人民公社运输站以及航行在沿海、内河的船舶的职工，共六百多万人，守候在收音机和扬声器前，收听了大会的实况广播。在大会进行的三个多小时当中，他们纷纷给大会打来电报和长途电话，报告他们在交通运输工作岗位上取得的最新成就，表示他们提前完成今年运输计划的决心和信心。北京市四个运输单位的报喜队，敲锣打鼓，舞着狮、龙，把一批生产喜报送进了大会的中心会场。（附图片）
