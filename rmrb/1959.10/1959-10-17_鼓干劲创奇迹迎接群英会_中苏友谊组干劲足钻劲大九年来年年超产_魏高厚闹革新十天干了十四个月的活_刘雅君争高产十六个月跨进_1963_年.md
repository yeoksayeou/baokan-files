　　Stir Up Enthusiasm, Create Miracles, and Greet the Gathering of Heroes
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Group Has Sufficient Enthusiasm and Diligence; Overfulfilling Production Targets Every Year for Nine Years
    Wei Gaohou Makes Innovations; Completes Fourteen Months of Work in Ten Days; Liu Yajun Strives for High Output; Enters 1963 in Sixteen Months
    (Our Newspaper reports) Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, the workers of the famous Harbin Rolling Stock Plant's Sino-Soviet Friendship Group, full of soaring enthusiasm, victoriously completed the workload of the Third Five-Year Plan on September 7th of this year and are now striding into 1968.
    Since 1950, this group has successfully completed its production tasks every year, maintaining the glorious title of Advanced Group for nine consecutive years. After completing the First Five-Year Plan in three years, during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the leadership of the Party, they advanced victoriously, achieving 101 technical innovations and completing 42 months of work. At the beginning of this year, after multiple deliberations and discussions, they formulated another leap forward plan to do five years of work in one year and increase production ninefold. In the process of completing the leap forward plan, their enthusiasm was sufficient, their diligence was great, and therefore they overcame many difficulties and fulfilled their promises.
    Their important method for completing the plan is to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously promoting technical innovation, vigorously promoting advanced experiences, and carrying out rationalization proposal activities; wherever the Party points, they strike there, and they are indomitable in the face of difficulties. In order to continuously improve production efficiency, group leader Hu Guiting and the group's workers, referring to a "foreign" threading machine in a boiler factory, spent two months and more than 50 experiments, and finally successfully manufactured a "native" threading machine, increasing production efficiency by 20 times. In addition, they also transformed and manufactured four special-purpose equipment such as thread rolling machines and threading machines, increasing production efficiency by two to eight times respectively; they manufactured two sets of pneumatic fixtures, and the efficiency of clamping increased by 50 times compared to the past. Since the beginning of this year, 15 advanced experiences have been promoted, increasing production efficiency by 75% to 15 times; more than 1,500 rationalization proposals have been put forward.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th) The famous Youth Red Banner bearer, Wei Gaohou, a milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, has been seizing every minute and second since October, relying on the masses, and repeatedly creating outstanding achievements to offer as a gift to the upcoming National "Heroes' Assembly." After completing the equivalent of four months and twenty-eight days of work in four days from October 5th to 8th, he completed the equivalent of nine months and four days of work in six days from the 9th to the 14th. Wei Gaohou originally planned to complete the equivalent of eight to ten months of work before going to Beijing to attend the "Heroes' Assembly" in late October. Now, this plan has been greatly exceeded ahead of schedule.
    The outstanding achievements of completing fourteen months of work in ten days, created by Wei Gaohou, have all been achieved by improving labor efficiency through technical innovation. One of the important reasons for Wei Gaohou's tremendous achievements in technological innovation since October is that he relies more on the collective and pays attention to seeking the help of experienced workers. Advanced pacesetters in the Chang'an Machine Factory formed a pacesetter team. Wei Gaohou first actively relied on the masters in the pacesetter team, humbly learning and asking them for advice. With the support and help of the advanced figures in the pacesetter team, he realized 41 technical innovation proposals in the ten days from October 5th to 14th.
    In order to continuously improve production efficiency, Wei Gaohou is paying attention to technical innovation anytime and anywhere. From October 12th to 14th, while attending the Chongqing Municipal Advanced Producer Representative Conference, he attended the meeting during the day and rushed back at night to fight at night. Late at night on the 12th, Wei Gaohou returned to the factory and found that apprentices Qin Yegui and Liu Jinmao were finding it very difficult to process the 16-kilogram gear rack, and the efficiency was very low. He and the apprentices studied and experimented together, changing the milling head of the rack to a saw head, and succeeded in the experiment that night, increasing efficiency 50 times.
    (Our Newspaper reports) Liu Yajun, a lathe operator and Communist Youth League member in the parts workshop of the Changxindian Communication Factory in Beijing, has completed more than 59 months of work in sixteen months since she started working independently in June last year. She is now producing for April 1963.
    A massive "Learn from Yajun, catch up with Yajun, and enter October 1960" movement is being carried out enthusiastically in the Changxindian Communication Factory. Up to now, more than 200 of the factory's more than 1,000 workers have successively overfulfilled this year's production tasks and entered 1960 or 1961. In order to commend Liu Yajun's outstanding achievements, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded her the title of Beijing High-Yield and High-Quality Youth Red Banner bearer.
    Liu Yajun is 18 years old this year. Because she has established a sense of ownership and a communist style of daring to think and act under the education and care of the Party and the glorious illumination of the General Line of socialist construction, she has mustered soaring enthusiasm, constantly learned from the advanced, and tried every means to overcome difficulties. For the past sixteen months, she has achieved high output every day and high output every ten days. In terms of quality, she insisted on checking the first piece, and then checked two or three times in the middle, and took the initiative to let the inspector check her work, so none of the more than 300,000 products she produced were defective.
    Liu Yajun often seizes various opportunities to learn from other people's good experiences. Since she became the factory's advanced pacesetter, she has been more humbly learning advanced experiences from others and constantly helping others in terms of ideology and technology to achieve the goal of jointly leaping forward. Dou Xiulin, a lathe operator in the third machine tool group of the parts workshop, was sometimes unable to complete the monthly quota in the past. Under Liu Yajun's specific help and encouragement, she had completed the annual production plan by the beginning of October and entered 1960. Now, Liu Yajun is striving to complete the workload of 1964 within the year with the practical action of completing three days' tasks in one day. (Picture Attached)

　　鼓干劲创奇迹迎接群英会
    中苏友谊组干劲足钻劲大九年来年年超产
    魏高厚闹革新十天干了十四个月的活　刘雅君争高产十六个月跨进1963年
    本报讯　著名的哈尔滨车辆厂中苏友谊小组职工，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，干劲冲天，已在今年9月7日胜利完成了第三个五年计划的工作量，现正大步跨进1968年。
    这个小组从1950年以来，每年都出色地完成了生产任务，连续九年保持了先进小组的光荣称号。他们用三年时间完成了第一个五年计划以后，在大跃进的1958年里，在党的领导下，乘胜前进，又实现了一百零一件技术革新，完成了四十二个月的工作量。今年年初，经过多次酝酿和讨论，又订出了一年干五年活、生产翻九番的跃进计划。在完成跃进计划的过程中，他们的干劲足、钻劲大，因而战胜了重重困难，实现了自己的诺言。
    他们完成计划的重要方法就是坚持政治挂帅，大闹技术革新，大力推广先进经验和开展合理化建议活动，党指向哪里就打向哪里，在困难面前百折不挠。为了不断提高生产效率，小组长胡桂庭和全组工人参照锅炉厂的一台“洋”铰丝机，经过两个月时间，五十多次试验，终于制造成功一台“土”铰丝机，提高生产效率二十倍。此外，他们还改造和制造了滚丝机、铰丝机等四台专用设备，分别提高生产效率二倍至八倍；制造了两套风动卡具，卡活效率比过去提高了五十倍。今年以来推广了十五项先进经验，分别提高生产效率75％到十五倍；提出了一千五百多件合理化建议。
    据新华社重庆16日电　著名的青年红旗手、重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚，10月份以来争分夺秒，依靠群众，一再创造出优异的成绩，向将要举行的全国“群英大会”献礼。他在10月5日到8日以四天时间完成了相当于四个月零二十八天的工作量以后，又在9日到14日的六天中完成了相当于9个月零四天的工作量。魏高厚原来计划在10月下旬到北京参加“群英大会”以前完成相当于八个月到十个月的工作量，现在，这一计划已经大大提前超额完成了。
    魏高厚创造的在十天里完成十四个月工作量的优异成绩，都是通过革新技术提高劳动效率取得的。10月份以来，魏高厚革新技术取得如此巨大的成就，重要的原因之一是他更加依靠集体，注意争取老师傅的帮助。长安机器厂的先进标兵组成了一个标兵团。魏高厚首先积极依靠标兵团的师傅们，虚心向他们学习、请教。他在标兵团先进人物的支持和帮助下，在10月5日到14日的十天中就实现了四十一项技术革新建议。
    魏高厚为了不断提高生产效率，随时随地都在注意革新技术。10月12日到14日他在参加重庆市先进生产者代表大会期间，白天参加会议，晚上还赶回来夜战。12日深夜，魏高厚回到厂里，发现学工秦业贵、刘金铆加工十六公斤重的元车齿条非常吃力，效率很低。他便和学工们一起研究试验，把齿条的铣头改为锯头，当天夜里就试验成功，工效提高了五十倍。
    本报讯　北京市长辛店通信工厂部件车间车工、共青团员刘雅君，从去年6月开始独立工作到今天，用十六个多月的时间完成了五十九个多月的工作量，现在已经在进行1963年4月的生产了。
    一个声势浩大的“学雅君、赶雅君，10月份跨进1960年”运动，正在长辛店通信工厂热火朝天地展开。截至目前，全厂一千多名工人中已有二百多名先后超额完成了今年的生产任务，跨进了1960年或1961年。为了表彰刘雅君的出色成绩，共青团北京市委授予她北京市高产优质青年红旗手的称号。
    刘雅君今年十八岁，由于她在党的教育关怀和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，树立了主人翁的思想和敢想敢干的共产主义风格，鼓足了冲天干劲，不断地向先进学习，千方百计地克服困难，十六个月来日日高产，旬旬高产。在质量方面她坚持检查第一个活，中途又检查两三次，主动地把自己的活让检查员检查，所以在她生产的三十余万件产品中，没有一个废品。
    刘雅君经常抓紧各种机会，学习别人的好经验，自从她成为全厂先进标兵后，更加虚心地向别人学习先进经验，并不断的在思想上、技术上帮助别人，达到共同跃进的目的。部件车间机床三组车工窦秀林，过去有时不能按时完成月定额，在刘雅君的具体帮助和鼓舞下，到10月初已经完成了全年生产计划，跨到1960年。现在，刘雅君正以三天任务一天完的实际行动，力争年内完成1964年的工作量。（附图片）
