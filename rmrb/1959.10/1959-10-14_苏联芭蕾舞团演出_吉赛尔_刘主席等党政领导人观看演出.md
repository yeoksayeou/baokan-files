Xinhua News Agency, 13th — The Soviet National Bolshoi Ballet performed the classic ballet "Giselle" tonight at the Beijing Exhibition Center Theater. The famous Soviet People's Artist Ulanova, who played the female lead in the ballet, perfectly created a moving image of a pure and innocent girl faithful to love with her exquisite dance and rich and profound emotion. More than two thousand spectators in the capital enjoyed the outstanding performance of this ballet art master and all the actors tonight.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Chairman Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee Lin Biao, General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, Members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Peng Zhen and Chen Yi, Secretaries of the Secretariat Wang Jiaxiang and Tan Zheng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Lin Feng, Vice Premier of the State Council Luo Ruiqing, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, all attended the performance tonight.

Antononov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China also attended the performance tonight.

The two-act ballet "Giselle" is a masterpiece by the famous 19th-century French composer Adolphe Adam, depicting a love story of a simple peasant girl. "Giselle" has been warmly welcomed by audiences in various countries for more than a hundred years since its premiere in Paris in 1841.

As the curtain rose, a tranquil village bathed in sunlight appeared on the stage. The young girl Giselle falls in love with Albert, a nobleman in disguise. Finally, when she discovers that Albert is concealing his noble status and deceiving her, her hopes and fantasies of happiness are shattered. She faints on the ground and leaves the world in despair. As the second act begins, in the middle of a quiet village cemetery, the ghosts of the Wilis appear in the moonlight. Legend has it that these are a group of brides who unfortunately died before their wedding. Unwilling to lie in the ground forever, they emerge from their graves in groups every night to dance. Any young men who pass by must dance with them until they are exhausted and die. One night, Albert, unable to forget Giselle, comes to her grave, and a group of Wilis immediately surround him. Just as Albert is about to meet his doom, the ghost of Giselle appears. She protects Albert with her pure and innocent love, saving him.

Ulanova's beautiful performance, full of poetry and simple emotion, provided the capital's audience with an unforgettable artistic experience. As the blue curtain slowly rose, Ulanova stepped onto the stage with extremely light steps. Her gentle posture and nuanced expression of joy perfectly expressed the rural girl Giselle's infinite longing for a pure and true love life. When Giselle discovers Albert's deception, Ulanova very delicately expressed the heroine's complex inner feelings of confusion, despair, and so on about love. And when Giselle's ghost comes out to save Albert in the second act, Ulanova's light dance steps and moving expressions even more deeply gripped the hearts of more than two thousand spectators. The performances of Fadeyechev and Korin, honored artists of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, who played the male lead Albert and the forest ranger Hans, were also very outstanding tonight. During the performance, the audience applauded many times, praising Ulanova and the outstanding performances of other Soviet artists. At the end of the performance, Ulanova and all the actors took bows in the warm applause as many as six times.

The conductor of the orchestra tonight was the famous Soviet People's Artist and Stalin Prize winner, Yu.F. Fayer. His excellent conducting art and the successful performance of all the musicians infused the whole play with soft music, vivid rhythms, and rich and colorful orchestral sounds, taking the audience into a poetic realm.

Famous figures from the capital's literary and art circles attended and appreciated today's wonderful performance, and they enthusiastically praised Ulanova's outstanding art. Mei Lanfang said that the performance of "Giselle" was like a beautiful poem. Ouyang Yuqian exclaimed that Ulanova was the embodiment of beauty. Dai Ailian believes that this is the best "Giselle" she has ever seen. Zhao Feng pointed out that Ulanova is a great dancer and a great actor.

After the performance, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Zhu De, Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, and others went on stage to shake hands with the Soviet actors one by one and took a group photo with them. Cultural workers in the capital presented flowers to the actors. (Attached picture)

　　苏联芭蕾舞团演出“吉赛尔”
    刘主席等党政领导人观看演出
    新华社13日讯　苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团今晚在北京展览馆剧场演出了古典舞剧“吉赛尔”。在舞剧中扮演女主角的著名苏联人民演员乌兰诺娃，以优美绝伦的舞姿和丰富深厚的感情，完美地创造了一个忠实于爱情的纯真少女的动人形象。首都两千多名观众今晚尽情地欣赏了这位芭蕾舞艺术大师和全体演员的卓越表演。
    刘少奇主席、宋庆龄副主席、朱德委员长、中共中央副主席林彪、总书记邓小平，中共中央政治局委员彭真、陈毅，书记处书记王稼祥、谭政，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、陈叔通、林枫，国务院副总理罗瑞卿，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，国防委员会副主席傅作义等，都出席观看了今晚的演出。
    苏联驻华大使馆临时代办安东诺夫以及各国驻华使节也都观看了今晚的演出。
    两幕舞剧“吉赛尔”是法国十九世纪著名作曲家阿道尔夫·亚当的杰作，它描写了一个纯朴的农家姑娘的爱情故事。“吉赛尔”自从1841年在巴黎首次公演以后，百多年来一直深受各国观众的热烈欢迎。
    幕启，舞台上出现了一个阳光熙熙的宁静村庄，少女吉赛尔爱上了一个乔装的贵族阿尔伯特，最后当她发现阿尔伯特是在隐瞒自己的贵族身分欺骗她时，她的幸福希望和幻想破灭了。她昏倒在地上，绝望地离开了人间。第二幕开始的时候，在一片静悄悄的村庄墓地的坟冢中间，一群伟利斯女鬼的幽灵在月光下出现了。据传，这是一群在结婚前不幸逝世的新嫁娘，她们不甘长眠地下，每逢夜间便从坟墓中走出来成群结队地跳舞，路过这里的青年遇到她们就不得不同她们一起跳舞，直跳到力竭身死。一个深夜，没有忘情的阿尔伯特来到了吉赛尔的墓地，一群伟利斯女鬼马上把他包围了。眼看阿尔伯特要遭到厄运。忽然，吉赛尔的幽灵出现了，她卫护着阿尔伯特，以一片纯洁无邪的爱情保护和拯救了他。
    乌兰诺娃充满诗意与纯朴感情的美妙表演，给首都观众得到了一次难忘的艺术享受。蓝色的帷幕徐徐揭开以后，乌兰诺娃以极轻快的舞步走上舞台，她那种柔和的姿态和细致入微的喜悦表情，完美地表达了农村少女吉赛尔对纯真的爱情生活的无限憧憬。当吉赛尔发现她所爱的阿尔伯特对她的欺骗行为时，乌兰诺娃又很细致地表达了女主人公对爱情的困惑、绝望等复杂的内心感受。而在第二幕吉赛尔的幽灵出来拯救阿尔伯特的时候，乌兰诺娃那轻盈的舞步和动人的表情，更深深地扣住了两千多观众的心弦。扮演舞剧男主角阿尔伯特和山林看守人汉斯的俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国功勋演员法捷耶切夫和柯林，他们今晚的表演也非常出色。在演出中，观众多次鼓掌，赞扬乌兰诺娃和苏联其他艺术家的卓越表演。在演出结束的时候，乌兰诺娃和全体演员在热烈的掌声中谢幕达六次之多。
    今晚演出的乐队指挥是著名的苏联人民演员、斯大林奖金获得者尤·菲·法耶尔。他的卓越指挥艺术和全体音乐家的成功演奏，使全剧贯串着柔和的音乐、鲜明活泼的节奏和丰富多采的管弦乐音响，它把观众带到了诗一般的境地中去。
    首都文艺界的著名人士都出席欣赏了今天的精采表演，他们热烈赞扬乌兰诺娃的卓越艺术。梅兰芳说，“吉赛尔”的演出就好像是一首美妙的诗。欧阳予倩赞叹说，乌兰诺娃是美的化身。戴爱莲认为这是她所看到的最好的“吉赛尔”。赵沨指出，乌兰诺娃是伟大的舞蹈家，又是伟大的演员。
    演出结束后，刘少奇、宋庆龄、朱德、彭真、陈毅等，上台同苏联演员们一一握手，并在一起合影。首都的文化工作者向演员们赠送鲜花。（附图片）
