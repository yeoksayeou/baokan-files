　　We are grateful to the Soviet State Grand Theatre Ballet for their series of exquisite performances, which allowed us to appreciate the ballet art that vividly reflects the broad aesthetic views of the Soviet people. They performed classical ballets composed by several classical composers such as Chopin, Gounod, Saint-Saëns, and Tchaikovsky, as well as modern ballets composed by Soviet composers such as Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian, and Potapov. They also performed Ukrainian and Spanish folk dances, as well as the distinctive "Puppet Dance" composed by the Russian composer Lyadov. These performances truly illustrate the Soviet people's very broad aesthetic viewpoints, and also powerfully demonstrate that Soviet ballet artists have truly inherited the most outstanding traditions of European classical ballet art. Everyone understands that only by truly inheriting the excellent legacy of classical ballet art is it possible to create a socialist modern ballet art with a high level. Soviet ballet artists have made outstanding contributions to ballet art worldwide in these two aspects, so Soviet ballet art truly has world significance, like Soviet literature and other arts.
　　Tchaikovsky's music is famous for deeply revealing the spiritual world of the Russian people with its beautiful, simple, and emotionally distinct melodies. His ballet music also has this characteristic, thus standing out in ballet music. Prokofiev's ballet music inherited this tradition from Tchaikovsky, but made new developments. Prokofiev's music has a distinct and unique style, is good at discovering new colors from different instrument combinations, and boldly expands the expressive power of musical language. To put it correctly, because he is proficient in classical music and has made extremely in-depth observations of people's lives, he can boldly innovate musical language, enabling him to use a unique musical language to express a broad range of people's lives. His outstanding ballet music "Romeo and Juliet" and many other large-scale instrumental and vocal works are well-known to us. The "Stone Flower" performed by the ballet troupe this time is another outstanding ballet music work of his, which has increased our further understanding of this master's ballet music. Prokofiev used several Ural folk music pieces as the basis in his works, and developed them creatively. In this way, he not only increased the local characteristics of the ballet, but also powerfully strengthened the connection between the ballet and the people's lives in the Ural region, making us feel that these legendary characters have a higher sense of reality. The music of this ballet provides us with a learning example.
　　Of course, the music of this ballet has even more important achievements, that is, it uses both realistic and romantic creative methods to deal with the struggle between good and evil in people's lives. The author passionately praises all the good people, such as the protagonists Danila, Katerina, and the Copper Mountain Princess, and utters scathing curses on the evil Severian, expressing the author's kind heart and profound people's ideology. The obvious contrast in the music gives the audience a deep impression not only from the images of the dancers and the dance, but also unforgettable images from the music. Of course, these cannot be fully explained in this short article.
　　To complete the creation of this outstanding ballet music, there are strict requirements for the orchestra, especially the conductor. The orchestra, conducted by Soviet People's Artist Yu.F. Fayer, brilliantly completed this task. The audience in our capital appreciated not only the exquisite dance performances in all their performances, but also the perfect musical performances. Under Fayer's baton, the sound emitted by the orchestra completely made us forget that it was emitted from instruments made of matter, often making us feel like it was a clear and infectious song from a human mouth, sometimes full of joy and hope, sometimes full of pain and melancholy, sometimes it almost makes people feel like they are listening to an emotionally激发的 inspired poet singing heartily, thus enhancing the power of the ballet. Whatever actions and expressions cannot achieve, the music perfectly replaces their position. Therefore, we cannot help but think that the art of the Soviet State Grand Theatre Ballet can reach such a peak, and it must be attributed to the artistic cooperation established by People's Artist Fayer and People's Artist B.S. Virsaladze with their outstanding labor and ballet master Ulanova and other artists to create perfect socialist and communist art to inspire the people. As art workers and audiences in the capital, we express our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet ballet master, People's Artist Ulanova, and the Soviet People's Artist, outstanding conductor Fayer, and other artists!

　　芭蕾舞音乐的典范
　　吕骥
    感谢苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团为我们作了一系列精美的表演，使我们能够欣赏到鲜明地反映了苏联人民广泛的审美观点的芭蕾舞艺术。他们表演了萧邦、古诺、圣·桑斯、柴可夫斯基等几个古典作曲家作曲的古典芭蕾舞，也表演了萧斯塔可维奇、普罗科菲耶夫、哈恰图良、波塔波夫等苏联作曲家作曲的现代芭蕾舞，表演了乌克兰和西班牙民间舞蹈，也表演了俄罗斯作曲家李亚多夫作曲的别具风格的“木偶舞”，这些表演，真实地说明了苏联人民十分广泛的审美观点，同时也有力地说明了苏联芭蕾舞艺术家真正继承了欧洲古典芭蕾舞艺术中最优秀的传统。大家都理解：只有真正继承了古典芭蕾舞艺术的优秀遗产，才有可能创造出社会主义的具有高度水平的现代芭蕾舞艺术。苏联芭蕾舞艺术家正是在这两个方面对全世界芭蕾舞艺术作出了卓越的贡献，因此苏联芭蕾舞艺术真正具有了世界意义，如苏联的文学及其他的艺术一样。
    柴可夫斯基的音乐是以优美、简洁而情绪鲜明的曲调深刻地揭露了俄罗斯人民的精神世界而著名的，他所写的芭蕾舞音乐同样具有这个特点，因而在芭蕾舞音乐中独树一帜。普罗科菲耶夫的芭蕾舞音乐正是继承了柴可夫斯基的这个传统，却又作了新的发展。普罗科菲耶夫的音乐具有鲜明的独特的风格，善于从不同的乐器组合中发现新的色彩，而且大胆地扩大了音乐语言的表现能力，正确地说，是由于他精通古典音乐，而对于人民生活又作了极其深入的观察，因此他能够大胆地革新音乐语言，使他能够运用一种具有独特风格的音乐语言去表现广阔的人民生活。他的杰出的芭蕾舞音乐“罗蜜欧与朱丽叶”和其他许多大型器乐曲和声乐曲都是我们所熟知的，这次芭蕾舞团表演的“宝石花”是他的另一部杰出的芭蕾舞音乐作品，通过这部作品，增加了我们对于这位大师的芭蕾舞音乐的进一步了解。普罗科菲耶夫在他的作品中采用了几首乌拉尔民间音乐作为基础，加以独创性的发展，这样，不仅增加了这部舞剧的地方特点，也有力地加强了这部舞剧和乌拉尔地区的人民生活之间的联系，更使我们觉得这些传说中的人物具有更高的真实感。这部舞剧的音乐对我们提供了一种学习的范例。
    当然，这部舞剧音乐还有更重要的成就，那就是，它以既是现实主义的，也是浪漫主义的创作方法处理了人民生活中善良与邪恶之间的斗争，而作者对于一切善良的人，如主角达尼拉、卡捷里娜、铜山公主作了热情的歌颂，对于邪恶的谢维里扬作了切齿的诅咒，表现了作者的善良的心灵和深刻的人民思想，音乐上明显的对比，使观众不仅从舞蹈艺术家的形象中、舞蹈中得到了深刻的印象，同样也从音乐中得到了难忘的形象。这些，当然不是这篇短文所能充分说明的了。
    要完成这部杰出的芭蕾舞音乐的创造，对于乐队，特别是指挥，有着严格的要求，由苏联人民演员尤·菲·法耶尔指挥的乐队出色地完成了这个任务。我们首都的观众在他们所有演出中，不仅欣赏了精湛的舞蹈表演，同样也欣赏了完美的音乐表演。在法耶尔的指挥下，乐队所发出来的声音完全使我们忘了它是发自由物质造成的乐器，常常使我们觉得像从人的口中发出来的清晰而富于感染力的歌声，时而充满着喜悦和希望，时而充满着痛苦和忧郁，有时简直令人觉得是在听一个感情激发的充满灵感的诗人在纵情歌唱，这样就增强了芭蕾舞的力量，凡是动作和表情所不能达到的，音乐便完美地代替了它们的地位。所以我们不能不这样想，苏联国家大剧院的芭蕾舞团的艺术之能达到如此高峰，不能不归功于人民演员法耶尔和人民美术家巴·西·维尔萨拉捷以他们出色的劳动和芭蕾舞大师乌兰诺娃和其他艺术家们的共同为创造社会主义的、共产主义的完美的艺术以鼓舞人民而建立的艺术合作。作为首都的艺术工作者和观众，我们对苏联的芭蕾舞大师人民演员乌兰诺娃和苏联人民演员、卓越的指挥家法耶尔和其他艺术家们表示衷心的谢意！（附图片）
