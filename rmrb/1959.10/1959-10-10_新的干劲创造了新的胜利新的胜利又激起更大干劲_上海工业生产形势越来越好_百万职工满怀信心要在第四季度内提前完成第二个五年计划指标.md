Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 7th (Reporters Zhang Jiachi and He Changhua) reported: The great victories of the nationwide anti-Rightist, boost-morale, all-out battle of August and September, and the glorious achievement of Shanghai's industrial production in the third quarter of achieving "all-round red," have created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for Shanghai to smoothly complete the more arduous industrial production plan for the fourth quarter. New drive creates new victories, and new victories inspire the masses with even greater drive. Production is booming, and the situation is getting better and better. At the beginning of October, Shanghai's millions of industrial workers, encouraged by the new victorious situation, are advancing victoriously. They not only have full confidence but also have specific measures and methods to strive to complete the year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule and complete the targets stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter.

    Over the past two months, the vast number of workers and staff in Shanghai's industrial system have responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and launched a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, enabling the third quarter to comprehensively over fulfill the plan. The city's total industrial output value completed 102.5%. The seven industrial bureaus, including metallurgy, machinery, textiles, and light industry, as well as major products such as steel, steel products, heavy machinery, paper, and cotton yarn, all over fulfilled the plan. Fifteen major products listed in the state plan, such as metal-cutting machine tools, power station boilers, steam turbines, automobile tires, and gunny sacks, have completed the annual plan three to four months ahead of schedule.

    Shanghai's industrial production tasks for the fourth quarter remain very arduous. This year, the city's total industrial output value strives to exceed the level of 22.8 billion yuan stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, requiring a further leap forward of 40% compared with last year's actual total output value, reaching 24 billion yuan. To achieve this Great Leap Forward target, more than 30% of the annual total output value plan must be completed in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 22% compared with the third quarter.

    Shanghai's new surge in the fourth quarter fully reflects the new needs for a greater leap forward after the nationwide anti-Rightist, boost-morale campaign, and also reflects the new requirements put forward by various parts of the country to maintain the production level of the fourth quarter of this year in the first quarter of next year. For example, the task of power station equipment in Shanghai's electrical machinery industry has basically completed the annual plan ahead of schedule by the end of the third quarter. Recently, various parts of the country are striving for greater victories in the fourth quarter and next year, and have requested that power station construction be launched ahead of schedule to ensure the power needs during the leap forward. Therefore, Shanghai's electrical machinery industry strives to overproduce 150,000 to 250,000 kilowatts of power station equipment in the fourth quarter, and the newly added task is almost equal to half of last year's total output.

    The result of the all-out battle in August and September has also created extremely favorable conditions for Shanghai's industry itself to complete the fourth-quarter plan. This crucial battle not only enabled Shanghai to comprehensively over fulfill the third-quarter industrial production plan, but also enabled Shanghai's industry to reach a new production level. Especially in September, the situation of the city's industrial production was even better, and the total output value completed has approached the requirements of the fourth quarter. Calculated according to the annual leap forward target, more than 2.47 billion yuan still needs to be completed each month in the fourth quarter, while the level of 2.35 billion yuan has already been reached in September. The city's workers are determined to work harder and reap the fruits of the annual Great Leap Forward ahead of schedule.

    The average daily output of steel in the steel industry was more than 3,900 tons in July, more than 5,200 tons in August; while the average daily output in the second half of September soared to more than 7,300 tons, and successively created new records of 8,661 tons and 9,236 tons per day. From this gratifying development trend, the goal put forward by Shanghai's 100,000 steel workers to complete the state plan of producing 1.65 million tons of steel for the whole year fifteen days ahead of schedule and strive to reach the leap forward target of 1.8 million tons for the whole year is promising. The plan for the textile industry in the fourth quarter is larger than that in the third quarter. By the end of September, about 90% of the cotton mills in the city had reached the production level of the fourth quarter. The paper industry requires that the average daily output in the fourth quarter must reach more than 900 tons. In the second quarter, the daily output was only 500 to 600 tons, while at the end of September, it broke through the mark of 1,000 tons per day.

    Although the industrial production task in Shanghai in the fourth quarter is unprecedentedly huge, the situation is also unprecedentedly favorable. As a result of the nationwide all-out battle in August and September, the amount of various industrial and agricultural raw materials transported to Shanghai has greatly increased, the quality has been significantly improved, and the supply trend is getting better and better. Various parts of the country have promoted the lofty spirit of communist cooperation and strongly supported Shanghai in terms of the quantity, quality, and supply time of raw materials. During this period, the atmosphere of mutual assistance, proactive cooperation, and mutual support between various regions and Shanghai has been further developed.

    Most importantly, the Party's call for anti-Rightist and boosting morale has brought tremendous heat. From top to bottom and from cadres to the masses in the city, spirits are soaring and enthusiasm is high. After criticizing the Right-leaning slackening emotions of a few cadres and the empty talk style of shouting difficulties and not solving practical problems, cadres at all levels rushed to the front line to lead production and delve into difficulties to solve them. The broad masses of workers all raised their eyebrows and exhaled, their enthusiasm soaring, determined to make a name for themselves and show those "with the surname Right." After the cadres of Hudong Shipyard issued the call for anti-Rightist and boosting morale, they proposed to build the hull of a 3,000-ton coastal freighter at a high speed with a 30-day berth cycle, but some people thought "this is impossible." The workers felt that 30 days was too long and compressed the target to 26 days. Those who were already skeptical were even more puzzled at this time and said secretly, "The ship is not made of paper, how can such a big ship be built in 26 days?" The workers ignored these discouraging words and fought day and night on the slipway. The wind and rain could not extinguish the sparks of electric welding and gas cutting, nor could they cover up the roar of the rivet guns. As a result, it only took 19 days. This unprecedented high speed shocked those who originally had Right-leaning ideas and had to admit the power of the masses. The vigorous enthusiasm of the workers and staff on all fronts can overcome all difficulties in continuing to advance and overcome the more arduous tasks in the fourth quarter. Moreover, with the further implementation of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, this enthusiasm will become more and more vigorous.

    At present, all industrial departments in the city are continuing to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously carry out mass movements based on the successful experience gained in the all-out battle of August and September, so that the production upsurge that has been formed can be consolidated and continuously developed. At the end of September and the beginning of October, many factories have seized the time to make specific arrangements for production in October and the fourth quarter, and mobilized the masses to discuss plans and implement targets and measures to the team level. Various industrial departments are also taking various effective measures based on the experience of organizing production in the previous period and the problems discovered to overcome the contradictions in the large increase in production in the fourth quarter. For example, the power supply cannot keep up with the needs of industrial production. The relevant parties are stepping up the construction of new power generation equipment and trying their best to generate electricity as early as possible; taking all measures to increase the output of existing power generation equipment; and further carrying out mass-based power saving campaigns. With the upsurge of industrial production, the city's transportation tasks are also very heavy. At present, various industrial bureaus and districts are organizing and preparing to organize the self-provided freight vehicles of factories and enterprises in the city according to lines and blocks, and use them in a unified manner to give full play to their role.

    新的干劲创造了新的胜利新的胜利又激起更大干劲
    上海工业生产形势越来越好
    百万职工满怀信心要在第四季度内提前完成第二个五年计划指标
    本报上海7日电　记者张家炽、贺昌华报道：全国各地反右倾、鼓干劲、大战八九两月的巨大胜利和上海工业生产第三季度获得
  “满堂红”的辉煌战果，已经为上海顺利完成更为繁重的第四季度工业生产计划创造了空前有利的形势。新的干劲创造了新的胜利，而新的胜利又激起了群众更大的干劲。生产蒸蒸日上，形势越来越好。10月份一开始，上海百万产业工人就在新的胜利形势鼓舞下乘胜前进，他们不仅有充分的信心，而且已经有了具体的措施和办法，要在第四季度内争取提前完成全年的大跃进计划和提前完成第二个五年计划规定的指标。
    上海工业系统广大职工两个月来响应党的八届八中全会号召，掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮，使第三季度全面超额完成了计划。全市工业总产值完成了102.5％。冶金、机械、纺织、轻工业等七个工业局，钢、钢材、重型机械、纸张、棉纱等主要产品，全部超额完成计划。全市有十五种列入国家计划的主要产品，如金属切削机床、电站锅炉、汽轮机、汽车外胎、麻袋等，已经提前三个月到四个月完成了全年计划。
    上海第四季度的工业生产任务仍然十分艰巨。今年全市工业总产值争取超过第二个五年计划规定的二百二十八亿元的水平，要求比去年实际总产值再跃进40％，达到二百四十亿元。要实现这个大跃进的指标，今年第四季度还要完成全年总产值计划的30％以上，比第三季度再提高22％以上。
    上海工业第四季度新的高涨，充分反映了全国各地反右倾、鼓干劲以后更大跃进的新需要，也反映了全国各地为使明年第一季度保持今年第四季度生产水平而提出的新要求。像上海电机工业的电站设备任务，到第三季度末已经基本上提前完成了今年全年的计划。最近，全国各地争取第四季度和明年更大的胜利，纷纷要求电站建设提前上马，保证跃进中的电力需要。因此，上海电机工业力争在第四季度内再超额生产十五到二十五万瓩的电站设备，新增加的任务几乎等于去年全年产量的一半。
    大战八、九两月的结果，也使上海工业本身为完成第四季度计划创造了极为有利的条件。这一场关键性的战斗，不仅使上海全面超额完成了第三季度工业生产计划，而且使上海工业达到了一个新的生产水平。特别是在9月份，全市工业生产的形势更好，完成的总产值已经接近第四季度的要求。按照全年跃进指标计算，第四季度每月尚需完成二十四亿七千多万元，而9月份已经达到二十三亿五千万元的水平，全市职工决心再加一把劲，提前摘下全年大跃进的果实。
    钢铁工业7月份钢的平均日产量是三千九百多吨，8月份是五千二百多吨；而9月下半月的平均日产量则猛升到七千三百多吨，并且接连创造了日产八千六百六十一吨、九千二百三十六吨的新纪录。从这样可喜的发展趋势来看，上海十万钢铁工人提出的提前十五天完成全年产钢一百六十五万吨的国家计划，并争取全年达到一百八十万吨的跃进目标大有希望。纺织工业第四季度的计划比第三季度有较大增长，到9月末，全市已有90％左右的棉纺厂达到了第四季度的生产水平。造纸工业要求第四季度的平均日产量必须达到九百多吨，第二季度还仅仅日产五、六百吨，而在9月末则突破了日产一千吨的大关。
    第四季度上海工业生产任务虽然空前巨大，但形势也空前有利。全国各地大战八、九两月的结果，各种工业和农业原材料运沪数量大增，质量显著提高，而且供应的趋势越来越好。各地发扬了崇高的共产主义协作精神，从原材料的数量、质量和供应时间上都大力支援上海。这一时期，各个地区与上海之间的和衷共济、主动协作、互相支援的风气有了进一步的发展。
    最为重要的，是党的反右倾、鼓干劲的号召带来了巨大的热力，全市从上到下、从干部到群众，精神奋发，干劲充沛。各部门在批判了少数干部的右倾松劲情绪和空喊困难，不抓紧解决实际问题的空谈作风以后，广大干部纷纷奔赴第一线去领导生产，钻进困难中去解决困难。广大工人群众个个扬眉吐气，人人干劲冲天，决心要干出个样子来，给那些“姓右的”看看。沪东造船厂的干部们在党发出反右倾、鼓干劲号召以后，提出要以三十天的船台周期，高速度建成一艘三千吨沿海货轮的船体，但有人认为“这不可能”。而工人群众还嫌三十天太长，又把指标压缩到二十六天。那些本来就怀疑的人，这时更想不通了，暗地说：“船不是用纸糊的，这样大的船二十六天哪能行？”工人们没有理会这些泄气话，日日夜夜忘我地奋战在船台上。狂风暴雨也打不灭电焊和气割的火花，掩不住鈚锘枪的吼鸣。结果，只用了十九天。这一空前未有的高速度，使原来有右倾思想的人吃惊不已，不得不承认群众的威力，各条战线上职工群众这种旺盛的热情，可以战胜继续前进中的一切困难，攻克第四季度更为繁重的任务。而且随着党的八届八中全会公报和决议的进一步贯彻，这种热情将越来越旺盛。
    目前，全市各个工业部门正在根据大战八、九两月取得的成功经验，继续反对右倾、鼓足干劲、大搞群众运动，使已经形成的生产高潮巩固地并持续不断地发展下去。9月底10月初，已有许多工厂抓紧时间对10月份和第四季度的生产作了具体安排，并且发动群众讨论计划，把指标和措施落实到小组。各个工业部门还根据前一时期组织生产的经验和发现的问题，正在采取各种有力的措施，克服第四季度大增产中的矛盾。譬如电力供应跟不上工业生产的需要，有关方面正在加紧建设新的发电设备，尽力提早发电；采取一切措施，提高原有发电设备的出力；进一步开展群众性的节约用电运动。随着工业生产的高涨，市内运输任务也很繁重，目前，各工业局、各区正在和准备把全市工厂企业的自备货运车辆，按条条块块组织起来，统一调度使用，以充分发挥它们的作用。（附图片）
