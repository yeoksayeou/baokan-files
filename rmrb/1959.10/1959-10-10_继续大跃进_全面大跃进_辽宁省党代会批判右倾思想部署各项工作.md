Continue the Great Leap Forward, Comprehensive Great Leap Forward
Liaoning Provincial Party Congress Criticizes Rightist Ideology and Deploys Various Tasks

(Our Dispatch) The First Session of the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Liaoning Province was held from September 5th to 22nd. The task of this congress was to implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, oppose rightism, boost morale, and further promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy. During the meeting, the participating comrades conscientiously studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and, in the spirit and method of rectification, conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the work of Liaoning Province, achieving the goals of raising awareness, summarizing experience, unifying understanding, and strengthening unity. The congress issued a fighting call to the entire party in Liaoning Province: Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we must unite as one, resolutely oppose right-wing opportunism, hold high the glorious banner of the Party's General Line, actively carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, seize the opportunity, concentrate our efforts, and forge ahead courageously, to fulfill and overfulfill this year's production and construction plans, and to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule!

The congress noted with satisfaction that in the three years since the First Session of the First Party Congress of Liaoning Province, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the radiant illumination of the General Line, all aspects of Liaoning Province's work have made tremendous progress. In particular, since 1958, an unprecedented Great Leap Forward has emerged on all fronts of economy, politics, culture, and education in Liaoning Province. In 1958, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 56.3% compared to 1957, of which the total industrial output value increased by 62% compared to 1957, exceeding the total increase in output value in each year during the First Five-Year Plan; railway freight volume increased by 31.2% compared to 1957; the total investment in basic construction in the province increased by 57.2% compared to the actual amount completed in 1957. On the agricultural front, the Party led the vast number of farmers to overcome the most severe drought in decades and floods in some areas, achieving a great harvest. In 1958, Liaoning Province's total agricultural output value increased by 23.8% compared to 1957. The rural areas of the province realized the people's commune system. Work in finance and trade, culture and education, science and technology, health, sports, politics and law, etc., has also achieved great success. This year, Liaoning Province's national economy continues to make a Great Leap Forward. From January to August, the total industrial output value increased by 43.2% compared to the same period last year, and railway freight volume increased by 34.5%. In agriculture, the summer harvest was unprecedentedly abundant, and the total wheat output more than doubled compared to last year. Fisheries, fruit trees, tussah silkworms, etc., have also seen great development. In terms of finance and trade, from January to August, the total value of commodity purchases increased by 57.3% compared to the same period last year, and the retail sales of social commodities increased by 23.1% compared to the same period last year.

The meeting summarized the rich experiences of a series of movements such as rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune system. The most fundamental experience is that the Party must lead everything, and the absolute leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee for the realization of the Great Leap Forward in all work; in order to strengthen the leadership of the Party, it is necessary to strengthen the unity of the Party and fight against all words and deeds that split the Party. At the same time, all work must be carried out with mass movements. The attitude towards mass movements must be to boldly guide them and enthusiastically support them; in the future, we must continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Party's mass line. We must advocate the pioneering spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, continue to liberate our thinking, and resolutely criticize all kinds of rightist ideas.

The congress pointed out that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, Liaoning Province has basically completed the construction of an industrial base centered on the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex. The future economic construction policy is: to make full use of the existing industrial base, vigorously tap the potential of enterprises, better support the whole country, and, on this premise, gradually reverse some of the imbalances in the economy, so that it can develop better in a planned and proportionate manner. In order to achieve this policy, the congress made specific arrangements in terms of production and construction.

Based on the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the congress made comprehensive arrangements for the work of the province in the next few months. The central task of the industrial front in Liaoning Province in the next few months is to continue to widely and deeply carry out the vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's production and construction plans, and to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year. In practicing rigorous production and economy, it is necessary to fully implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In terms of industrial production, we must first vigorously grasp the production of raw materials, materials, fuels, and electricity, and, on the basis of ensuring the completion of the state plan, increase the production of steel by 200,000 tons, iron by 100,000 tons, steel products by 200,000 tons, and raw coal by 2 million tons. The production of other industrial products should also be increased accordingly. The machinery industry must first produce the equipment urgently needed this year and supply it in complete sets on time. The production of light industrial products necessary for people's daily life should also be increased as soon as possible, and the production of handicrafts should be rapidly restored and developed. In terms of basic construction, we must concentrate our efforts, ensure key projects, and especially accelerate the construction of coal mines, power stations, transportation, urban water sources, and other projects that undertake this year's production tasks. In terms of transportation, we must vigorously organize the fast loading and unloading of railway transportation, and actively carry out a mass movement for short-distance transportation. In industrial production and construction, we must pay attention to improving quality, pay attention to safe production, strengthen equipment maintenance, and strengthen the preparation for next year's production. At the same time, we must practice strict economy. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, we must continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen political and ideological work, and, in the spirit and method of rectification, mobilize the masses to speak out freely, and constantly criticize and overcome rightist ideas. Leading cadres must adhere to the system of eating, living, and laboring together with the masses, go deep among the masses to lead the masses, and go deep into production to lead production. We must guide the enthusiasm of the masses to technical innovation and technical revolution, widely carry out red flag competitions between enterprises and within enterprises, and set off a mass upsurge of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced.

On the agricultural front, all current work must be centered on the autumn harvest. Party organizations at all levels in rural areas must strengthen their leadership over the autumn harvest work, mobilize the masses to widely and deeply carry out the bumper harvest red flag competition movement, improve labor efficiency, and ensure the quality of the autumn harvest. This year's autumn harvest distribution work must follow the principles of the Central Committee's instructions on summer harvest distribution, and properly handle the mutual relationships between the state, the commune, the basic accounting unit, and the commune members. This winter and next spring, we must further rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes, take production as the center, deeply carry out the socialist education movement, oppose rightism and boost morale, criticize and overcome the rightist ideas existing in a small number of cadres and the capitalist ideas among a small number of the masses, strengthen management, rectify the work style of cadres, build the people's communes better, and run the public canteens better. In order to prepare conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward in agriculture next year, we must carry out autumn plowing in accordance with local conditions, vigorously carry out the mass-based farmland water conservancy movement with "small scale as the main, commune-run as the main, water storage as the main, and benefits in the same year as the main," and carry out the mass-based manure accumulation movement. In terms of non-staple foods, we strive to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables this year and self-sufficiency in meat throughout the province next year. We must strengthen the leadership of state-owned farms, and plan to establish non-staple food bases in the suburbs of large cities and in industrial and mining areas. Develop mass livestock farming, vigorously breed pigs, and hatch poultry. Aquatic product departments should actively develop marine fishing and make full use of reservoirs and rivers to vigorously develop freshwater aquaculture. Communes should further develop diversified operations and vigorously develop the production of local specialty products.

Doing a good job in this year's peak season purchase and sales work has special significance, as it can not only further shatter the fallacies of right-wing opportunists who attack the Great Leap Forward, but also provide strong support for the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over commercial work, adhere to putting politics in command, overcome the rightist ideas existing among commercial personnel, oppose the encroachment of capitalist ideas on commercial workers, and continue to make a Great Leap Forward in commercial work. With this year's bumper harvest throughout the province, we must resolutely complete the procurement tasks. In grain work, we must implement the Central Committee's proposed policy of looking ahead and behind, using abundance to make up for deficiency, long-term planning, and leaving room for maneuver; in addition, we must regularly conduct education on thrift and frugality among the people.

The congress, in connection with various practical tasks, launched a systematic and sharp criticism of rightist ideas. The meeting required all departments to earnestly carry out the anti-rightist struggle. Party organizations at all levels in the province must take opposing rightist ideas as the center, adopt the method of carrying out rectification movements in stages and in batches, combined with current work.

Finally, the congress elected the members and alternate members of the current provincial party committee, and adopted the "Resolution on Implementing the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and Carrying out the Campaign to Increase Production and Practice Economy."

    继续大跃进　全面大跃进
    辽宁省党代会批判右倾思想部署各项工作
    本报讯　中国共产党辽宁省第二届代表大会第一次会议，于9月5日到22日举行。这次代表大会的任务是贯彻执行八届八中全会的决议，反对右倾，鼓足干劲，进一步开展增产节约运动。会议期间，与会同志认真地学习了八届八中全会文件，以整风的精神和方法，对辽宁省的工作进行了广泛深入的讨论，达到了提高思想，总结经验，统一认识，增强团结的目的。大会向辽宁省全党发出战斗号召：要在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，同心同德，团结一致，坚决反对右倾机会主义，高举党的总路线的光荣旗帜，积极开展增产节约运动，抓紧时机，集中力量，勇往直前，为完成和超额完成今年的生产建设计划，提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗！
    代表大会满意地指出，在辽宁省第一届第一次党代表大会以来的三年多时间里，辽宁省在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，各方面工作都有了巨大的发展。特别是1958年以来，辽宁省经济、政治、文化教育各个战线上，都出现了史无前例的大跃进。1958年全省工农业总产值比1957年增长了56.3％，其中工业总产值比1957年增长了62％，超过了第一个五年计划期间各年产值增长的总和；铁路货运量比1957年增长31.2％；全省基本建设投资总额比1957年实际完成额增长57.2％。在农业战线上，党领导广大农民战胜了几十年来未有的严重干旱和部分地区的洪水，取得了大丰收。1958年，辽宁省农业总产值比1957年增长23.8％。全省农村实现了人民公社化。财贸、文教、科学技术、卫生、体育、政法等工作，也取得了巨大的成绩。今年，辽宁省的国民经济继续大跃进。1至8月份，工业总产值比去年同期增长43.2％，铁路货运量增长34.5％。农业方面，夏收作物空前大丰收，小麦总产量比去年增加一倍。渔产、果树、柞蚕等也都有很大发展。财贸工作方面，1至8月份商品收购总值比去年同期增长57.3％，社会商品零售额比去年同期增长23.1％。
    会议总结了整风反右、大跃进、人民公社化等一系列运动丰富的经验。其中最根本的经验就是：党必须领导一切，党的绝对领导是一切工作实现大跃进的最根本的保证；为了加强党的领导，就必须增强党的团结，向一切分裂党的言行进行斗争。同时，各项工作都必须大搞群众运动。对待群众运动必须是大胆地去指导它，满腔热情地去支持它；今后要继续发扬党的群众路线的光荣传统。要提倡敢想、敢说、敢做的首创精神，继续不断地解放思想，坚决批判各种各样的右倾思想。
    大会指出，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在全国人民大力支援下，辽宁省已经基本上完成了以鞍山钢铁联合企业为中心的工业基地建设。今后经济建设的方针是：充分利用现有的工业基础，大力挖掘企业的潜力，更好地支援全国，并在此前提下，逐步扭转经济中的某些不协调状况，使之更好地有计划按比例地发展。为了实现这一方针，大会在生产建设方面做了具体安排。
    大会根据党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议，对全省今后几个月的工作作了全面的部署。今后几个月辽宁省工业战线的中心任务，是要继续广泛深入地开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为完成和超额完成今年的生产和建设计划、在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。在厉行增产节约中要全面贯彻执行多快好省的方针。在工业生产方面，首先要大力抓紧原料、材料、燃料和电力的生产，在保证完成国家计划的基础上，再增产钢二十万吨、铁十万吨、钢材二十万吨、原煤二百万吨，其他工业产品也都要相应地增产。机械工业要首先生产出今年急需的设备并按时成套供应。人民日常生活必需的轻工业品也要尽速增加生产，并迅速恢复和发展手工业生产。在基本建设方面，必须集中力量，保证重点，特别是加快煤矿、电站、交通运输、城市水源和担负今年生产任务的其它项目的建设速度。在运输方面，必须大力组织铁路运输的快装快卸，并且积极开展一个短途运输的群众运动。在工业生产和建设中，要注意提高质量，注意安全生产，加强设备维修，加强明年生产的准备工作。同时，要厉行节约。在增产节约运动中，必须继续加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想工作，要以整风的精神和方法，发动群众大鸣大放，不断批判和克服右倾思想。领导干部要坚持与群众同吃同住同劳动的制度，深入群众中去领导群众，深入生产中去领导生产。要把群众的干劲引导到技术革新和技术革命上去，广泛开展企业之间和企业内部的红旗竞赛，掀起群众性的比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮。
    农业战线上，当前一切工作都要以秋收为中心。农村中各级党组织都要加强对秋收工作的领导，发动群众广泛深入地开展丰产红旗竞赛运动，提高劳动效率，保证秋收质量。今年秋收分配工作，必须遵照中央关于夏收分配指示的原则，妥善处理国家、公社、基本核算单位和社员之间的相互关系。今冬明春，要进一步整顿、巩固和提高人民公社，以生产为中心，深入开展社会主义教育运动，反右倾、鼓干劲，批判和克服少数干部中存在的右倾思想和少数群众中的资本主义思想，加强经营管理，整顿干部作风，把人民公社建设得更好，把公共食堂办得更好。为了给明年农业继续大跃进准备条件，要因地制宜地进行秋耕，大力开展群众性的“小型为主、社办为主、蓄水为主、当年收益为主”的农田水利运动，开展群众性的积肥运动。在副食品方面，争取今年做到蔬菜自给，明年做到全省肉食自给。要加强对国营农场的领导，并且有计划地在大城市近郊区和工矿区建立副食品基地。发展群众性的饲养业，大力繁殖生猪，孵化家禽。水产部门应积极发展海洋捕捞，充分利用水库、江河，大力开展淡水养殖。公社应进一步开展多种经营，大力发展土副特产的生产。
    做好今年的旺季购销工作有着特殊的意义，它不仅可以进一步粉碎右倾机会主义分子攻击大跃进的谬论，而且将给工农业大跃进以有力的支持。各级党委要加强对商业工作的领导，坚持政治挂帅，克服商业人员中存在的右倾思想，反对资本主义思想对商业工作人员的侵蚀，使商业工作继续大跃进。今年全省丰收，必须坚决完成征购任务。在粮食工作上，必须贯彻执行中央提出的瞻前顾后、以丰补歉、细水长流、留有余地的方针；此外，要在人民群众中经常进行勤俭持家的教育。
    大会联系各项实际工作，对右倾思想展开了系统的尖锐的批判。会议要求一切部门都切实进行反右倾的斗争。全省各级党的组织，要以反对右倾思想为中心，采取分期分批的办法，结合当前工作，开展一次整风运动。
    大会最后选出了本届省委的委员、候补委员，并且通过了“关于贯彻执行八届八中全会决议、开展增产节约运动的决议”。
