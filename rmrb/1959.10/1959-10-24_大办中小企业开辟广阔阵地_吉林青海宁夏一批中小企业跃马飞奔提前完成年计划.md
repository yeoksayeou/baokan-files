Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Jilin Province's local coal mines have, to date, already overfulfilled their annual raw coal production plan for the year. By the end of the year, the total annual output of these local coal mines is expected to reach 1.5 million tons. This is a victory for the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods.

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, Jilin Province's local coal industry achieved rapid development by implementing the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, launching a large-scale mass movement, and widely mobilizing the masses to report and run mines. The number of locally-run mines in the province increased from a dozen or so in 1957 to over five hundred. This year, these coal mines underwent systematic technical transformation, gradually developing from indigenous production methods to foreign production methods. After the "five determinations" work of determining the type, equipment, indicators, location, and personnel, the production of small mines has become regularized and mechanized. Currently, fifty-six pairs of small mines have been finalized, of which twenty-five pairs are being expanded. These small mines have added mechanical equipment for hoisting, drainage, transportation, and ventilation, and have promoted indigenous mechanical equipment such as horse-drawn winches for coal transportation, aerial basket coal transportation, fire truck drainage, wooden fan ventilation, and double-barrel hoisting winches, which have greatly changed the face of production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Twenty-six factories in Changchun City, including the Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Plant and the Transformer Plant, as well as dozens of production teams in factories such as the Asbestos Plant and the Locomotive Plant, have, to date, already completed their annual production tasks for the year ahead of schedule and entered 1960.

    In order to ensure the early completion of this year's production plan, each factory has widely launched a red flag competition of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and the advanced helping the backward, which has vigorously promoted the rapid development of the increase production and practice economy movement. The casting workshop of the Vehicle Plant and the Li Baotong team of the casting workshop of the Power Equipment Repair Plant, due to actively learning from and catching up with You Fengtai, the provincial and municipal labor model, have significantly reduced the scrap rate and entered 1960 a quarter ahead of schedule.

    In the increase production and practice economy movement, the broad masses of workers, with a daring and capable communist spirit, made great efforts in technical innovation and broke through many key production problems. The Meteorological Instrument Factory, in response to the key problems of raw materials in the second half of the year, launched a mass technical innovation campaign and completed the annual plan a quarter ahead of schedule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xining: On the 16th, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee held a broadcasting conference in the Xining area to award prizes for the red flag competition in the industrial and transportation systems during August and September. A number of advanced units of factories and mines in the Xining area were rewarded and commended.

    All the employees of the Xining Electrical Machinery and Hardware Manufacturing Factory took measures such as saving, substituting, purchasing from other places, undertaking processing, manufacturing themselves, and collaborating with other factories to actively solve the problem of material supply, so that the plan jumped again and again. The production tasks completed in August and September were equivalent to four-fifths of the actual completion of the first seven months of this year, which is more than half of the annual leap forward plan. The factory overfulfilled the annual total output value and output, variety, and other plans more than three months ahead of schedule, and successfully trial-produced a variety of new products. In the production of August and September, the workers of the Xining Iron and Steel Plant actively rushed to repair blast furnaces, learned advanced experience, and carried out technical innovations, so that the annual production task was overfulfilled four months ahead of schedule, the quality of pig iron was improved, and the consumption of coke was greatly reduced.

    This newspaper reports: Since the beginning of this year, the Yinchuan Wool Textile Factory has adhered to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements, making production waves higher than waves, and the original annual total output value plan was overfulfilled four months ahead of schedule.

    The original total output value plan of this factory this year increased by 17.9% compared with the total output value in 1958. When this plan was first put forward, a small number of people believed that "there are few machines, the conditions are poor, and production has reached its peak," and doubted the possibility of realizing this plan. However, the workers proposed to realize this plan by increasing the speed of the machines. The factory leadership supported this opinion. As a result, the speed of the spinning machine was increased from the original 103 revolutions per minute to 150 revolutions per minute; the output per thousand spindles increased from the original 46.3 kilograms to more than 70 kilograms; and the output per shift of the weaving machine increased from 26 meters to 36 meters.

    The factory also launched a mass competition movement of high yield, high quality, and low consumption. Production has risen in a straight line since May, and the national plan has been overfulfilled every month. The quality of the products has also increased month by month. The first-class rate of uniform cloth has been maintained at more than 99%, and more and more advanced figures in production have emerged.

    After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, a new leap forward situation appeared in this factory. The production plan in August exceeded any previous month, and the cost was reduced by 9.9% compared with the average of the whole year last year, and the original total output value plan for this year was overfulfilled by 0.24% four months ahead of schedule.

    大办中小企业开辟广阔阵地
    吉林青海宁夏一批中小企业跃马飞奔提前完成年计划
    据新华社长春电　吉林省地方煤矿到目前为止，已经提前超额完成了今年全年的原煤生产计划。到年底，这些地方煤矿的全年产量预计可以达到一百五十万吨。这是洋土并举方针的胜利。
    吉林省地方煤炭工业在1958年大跃进中，由于贯彻执行洋土并举方针，大搞群众运动，广泛发动群众报矿、办矿，获得了飞跃发展。全省地方办的矿井由1957年的十几个增加到了五百多个。今年，这些煤矿进行了系统的技术改造，由土法生产逐步发展为洋法生产。经过定型、定设备、定指标、定点、定员的“五定”工作以后，小矿井生产已走向正规化、机械化。目前已经定型的小矿井有五十六对，其中正在扩建的有二十五对。这些小矿井添置了提升、排水、运输、通风等机械设备，推广了马拉绞车运煤，空中走篮运煤，消防车排水、木制风机通风，以及双筒提升绞车等等土机械设备，大大改变了生产面貌。
    据新华社长春电　长春市交通设备制造厂和变压器厂等二十六个工厂，以及石绵厂、机车厂等工厂里的几十个生产小组，到目前为止已经提前完成了今年全年的生产任务，跨进了1960年。
    各厂为了保证提前完成今年生产计划，广泛展开了学先进、比先进、赶先进和先进帮助落后的红旗竞赛，有力地促进了增产节约运动的迅速发展。车辆厂铸工车间和发电设备修造厂铸工车间李宝童小组，由于积极学、赶省市劳动模范尤凤泰，使废品率显著下降，提前一个季度跨进了1960年。
    在增产节约运动中，广大职工以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，大闹技术革新，突破了许多生产关键。气象仪器厂针对下半年原料材料方面的关键问题，开展了群众性的技术革新活动，提前一个季度完成了全年计划。
    据新华社西宁电　中共青海省委、省人民委员会16日召开西宁地区工业交通系统大战8、9两月红旗竞赛颁奖广播大会。西宁地区的一批厂矿企业先进单位受到了奖励和表扬。
    西宁电机五金制造厂的全体职工，采取节约、代替、外地采购、承揽加工、自己制造和同外厂协作等措施，主动解决材料供应问题，使计划一跃再跃，8、9两个月完成的生产任务，相当于今年头七个月实际完成数的五分之四，等于全年跃进计划的一半以上；全厂提前三个多月超额完成了全年生产总值和产量、品种等计划，并且试制成功了多种新产品。西宁炼铁厂职工在8、9两月的生产中，积极抢修高炉，学习先进经验，进行技术革新，使全年生产任务提前四个月超额完成，生铁质量有了提高，焦炭消耗也大为降低。
    本报讯　银川毛纺织厂今年以来由于坚持了政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，使生产一浪高于一浪，原定的全年总产值计划提前四个月超额完成。
    这个厂今年原定的总产值计划比1958年总产值增加17.9％。当这个计划刚提出时，有一小部分人认为：“机器少，条件差，生产到顶了”，怀疑实现这个计划的可能性。而工人们却提出用提高车速的办法来实现这个计划。厂领导上支持了这个意见。结果纺纱机的转速由原来的每分钟一百零三转，提高到一百五十转；千锭时产量由原来的四十六点三公斤，提高到七十公斤以上；纺织机台班产量由二十六米，提高到三十六米。
    这个厂里还开展了高产、优质、低消耗的群众竞赛运动，从5月以后生产直线上升，月月超额完成国家计划，产品的质量也逐月上升，制服呢一等品率一直保持在99％以上，生产中的先进人物也越来越多。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布后，这个厂又出现了新的跃进局面。8月份的生产计划超过以前任何一月，成本比去年全年平均降低了9.9％，提前四个月超额0.24％完成了今年原订的总产值计划。
