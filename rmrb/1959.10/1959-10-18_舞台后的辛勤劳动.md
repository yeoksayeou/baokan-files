　　Hard Work Behind the Stage

　　In the performances celebrating the National Day, backstage workers contributed greatly with their enthusiasm and wisdom.

　　Extraordinary Stage Work

　　The grand performance of over two thousand five hundred artists held at the Great Hall of the People in the capital on October 3rd was a rare spectacle in China's art world. More than two thousand five hundred actors and backstage workers moved in and out of the same stage within three hours. Audiences who have been to the backstage of ordinary theaters would certainly worry that the backstage of this grand performance would be chaotic. In fact, the opposite was true. The backstage of this grand performance was well-ordered.

　　Strict organization and discipline were the "magical power" that ensured the orderliness of the backstage. During rehearsals, the organizers of the evening arranged the time and specific entrances and exits for the participating art units to enter and exit the backstage in a scientific manner according to the order of performances. This required every actor and backstage worker to act punctually and nimbly. If one person disobeyed the general command and moved slightly slowly, it would affect the overall situation. Everyone showed good organization during the performance. What was most touching was that the generals who participated in the generals' chorus, like obeying military discipline, obeyed the command of the stage, arriving and leaving on time, and moving quickly up and down, which was deeply admired by the literary and art workers.

　　Despite this, it was still inevitable that "tense situations" would occur. Once, it was suddenly discovered that the steel wire rope used for hanging the curtain needed to be adjusted, and the program was in progress. So a dozen stage workers climbed onto the high frame from behind the curtain and tensely adjusted the steel rope in thirteen minutes. When this seventeen-minute program was over, the grand curtain closed on time and in good condition.

　　An Apricot Branch Extends Over the Wall

　　Many people say that the setting of the Kunqu Opera "The Wall Top and Horseback" is full of poetic and picturesque charm, and is "unspeakably wonderful." A total of seven limited-length "backdrops" provide the actors with a broad space for performance and the audience with unlimited imagination. When Li Qianjun appeared, a bright red and gorgeous peony backdrop depicted this beautiful, bold, and passionate girl. Of deep significance is the scene where Li Qianjun and Pei Shaojun recite poems on the wall top and horseback: at the opening, the "backdrop" is a slanting red apricot tree, matched with a short wall temporarily built on the side of the stage, cleverly suggesting to the audience: "An apricot branch extends over the wall," adding to the atmosphere of the plot. Later, when Li Qianjun sternly criticized Pei Xingjian's snobbishness, the audience could deeply feel Qianjun's "untainted by mud" temperament from a "blue lotus" picture behind her.

　　These ingenious designs sparkle with the light of collective wisdom. Yu Zhenfei said that when they were rehearsing this play, they thought that since it was a new adaptation of an old play, the setting should also have new creations. The first trial performance used a three-dimensional setting, which looked magnificent, but restricted the performance. Many symbolic movements in Kunqu Opera contradicted the realistic setting. After several studies, director Yang Cunbin and Sun Haoran, a teacher at the Shanghai Theater Academy, redesigned the setting, and it was painted by graduate Zhu Zhang. Many teachers and students helped to work hard for three days and three nights to rush out this set of scenery.

　　The Magic of Makeup Artists

　　The drama "The Man with a Gun" allowed the audience to see the image of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin shaped by Chinese actors. In the drama "Aesop," realistic Brazilian men and women appeared. On the stage of "Nora," people saw many blond, brown-eyed, high-nosed, and long-eyelashed Northern Europeans. This is thanks to the magic of the makeup artists.

　　Let us visit the makeup room of "Nora": the makeup artists are very busy, as long as the actor says: hairpin, comb, perfume… the makeup artist immediately sends the required things to the actor. On another makeup table, makeup artist Chang Danian is putting makeup on Wu Xue. He grabbed five or six greasepaint sticks with his left hand, his palm was covered with various colors of greasepaint, and he quickly sketched with a paintbrush in his right hand, and the outline of a Norwegian appeared on Wu Xue's face. Then put on a curly hair and a wig, and in an instant, Helmer in "Nora" appeared.

　　These wigs are the crystallization of the makeup artist's efforts. Those golden hairs are hooked into the gauze holes one by one with needles. It takes three to five days to make a wig. An unfortunate female prospector lost all her braids at work. She was very sad looking at her bald head. Later, the theater made her a suitable perm wig. After putting it on, it looked even more beautiful than real hair. The girl was overjoyed and specially took a photo and sent it to the wig maker to express her heartfelt thanks.

　　The Huge Peking Opera Orchestra

　　"Havoc in the Dragon Palace" with more than 300 people began. Just as the monkeys were somersaulting in the air, suddenly a surging sound of waves was heard, as powerful as overturning rivers and seas. This was played by an orchestra of seventy-three people. This unprecedentedly large Peking Opera orchestra was composed of the first, second, and fourth troupes of the China Peking Opera Theatre, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, and the civilian and military musicians of the China Academy of Chinese Opera. The famous Qin player Li Muliang also participated in the performance. The musicians were tireless in their rehearsals, showing the spirit of "not giving up until they have practiced well." On the day of the ensemble, more than 70 musicians gathered together, and the harmonious sound of music gave people a feeling of harmony among hundreds of schools.

　　The music of "Havoc in the Dragon Palace" was composed on the premise of inheriting tradition. These musicians who "stir up waves" behind the scenes allocated the instruments according to the needs of the plot. For example, when providing music for the Dragon Girl's appearance and dance in the second act, Yunluo and Ruluo were added to set off the atmosphere of the Dragon Palace Wonderland, enhance the sound of the sea roaring during the naval battle, and make the audience feel as if they were on the scene.

### 舞台后的辛勤劳动

　　舞台后的辛勤劳动
    在献礼演出中，后台工作者，用他们的干劲和智慧创造了很多功绩。
    不平凡的舞台工作
    10月3日在首都人民大会堂举行的二千五百多人文艺大演出，是我国艺术界少见的盛举。二千五百多名演员和后台工作者在三个小时内出入同一个舞台。曾经到过普通剧院后台的观众，一定会担心这次大演出的后台会忙乱不堪。事实恰恰相反，这次大演出的幕后却秩序井然。
    严明的组织性和纪律性就是保证后台秩序井然的“神奇力量”。在排练中，晚会的组织者根据演出顺序，科学地给参加演出的艺术单位安排了进出后台的时间和专门的出入口。这就需要每一个演员和后台工作者准时、敏捷地行动。如果一个人不服从总指挥，动作稍为缓慢，就影响全局。演出中大家表现了很好的组织性。最令人感动的是参加将军大合唱的将军们，像服从军事纪律一样，服从了舞台的指挥，来去准时，上下迅速，深受文艺工作者们的钦佩。
    尽管如此，仍然难免出现“紧张局势”。一次，忽然发现挂帷幕用的钢丝绳需要调整，而节目又在进行中。于是十几个舞台工人从幕后爬上高架去，紧张地在十三分钟内把钢绳调整好，当这个占时十七分钟的节目演完时，大帷幕准时完好地合拢起来。
　　一枝红杏出墙来
    好多人都说昆曲“墙头马上”的布景富于诗情画意，“妙不可言”。总共七堂篇幅有限的“衬景”，却给演员以广阔的表演空间，给观众以无限的想像。李倩君出台时，一幅艳红富丽的牡丹衬景写照出这个美丽、大胆、热情的少女。寓意很深的是李倩君和裴少俊在墙头马上吟诗的一场：开幕时“衬景”上是一株斜欹的红杏，配上台侧临时搭成的一堵短墙，巧妙地向观众示意：“一枝红杏出墙来”，增加了剧情的气氛。后来当李倩君严斥裴行俭的势利眼时，观众可以从她背后一幅“青莲”图上，深深感受到倩君那种“出淤泥而不染”的气质。
    这些独具匠心的设计，闪烁着集体智慧的光芒。俞振飞说，当他们排练这出戏时就想到：既是旧剧新编，布景上也要有新创造。第一次试演时，采用了立体布景，看来富丽堂皇，却约束了表演。昆曲中许多象征性动作，同写实的布景发生了矛盾。经过几次研究，导演杨村彬同上海戏剧学院教师孙浩然等重新设计，由毕业生朱章绘画。许多师生帮助苦战了三天三夜，才赶出了这套布景。
    化装师的神通
    话剧“带枪的人”，使观众看到中国演员塑造的伟大革命导师列宁的形象，话剧“伊索”里，又出现了形态逼真的巴西男女，在“娜拉”的舞台上，人们又看到许多金发、褐眼、高鼻、长睫毛的北欧人，这要归功于化装师的神通。
    让我们参观一次“娜拉”的化装室：化装师正忙得不可开交，只要演员说声：发夹、梳子、香水……化装师马上把所需要的东西送到演员手里。在另一个化装台上，化装师常大年正在替吴雪化装，他左手抓住了五六支油彩笔，手掌上涂满了各色油彩，右手拿着彩笔迅速地勾画着，吴雪的脸上出现了挪威人的轮廓。再套上一个卷发和头套，转瞬间“娜拉”里的海尔茂就出现了。
    这些头套是化装师心血的结晶。那些金黄色的头发都是一根根的用针勾进纱孔里去的。制一个头套要三、五天的时间。有一个女勘探队员不幸在工作中把发辫全部拉掉了，她看着光秃秃的脑袋悲伤万分，后来这个剧院为她作了一个合适的烫发头套，装上以后，看来比真发还美。姑娘喜不自胜，特地照了像送给头套的制作工人，表示衷心的感谢。
    庞大的京戏乐队
    三百多人的“大闹龙宫”开演了。正当群猴凌空翻腾的时候，忽听得波涛汹涌声，势如翻江倒海，这是由七十三人的乐队演奏的。这个空前庞大的京剧乐队是由中国京剧院一、二、四团，北京京剧团和中国戏曲学校的文武场面人员一起组成的，著名琴师李慕良也参加了演奏。这个乐队中有六十多岁的乐师李善卿和崇恩山，也有青年二胡能手陆松林。在排练中乐师们百弹不厌，表现出“不练好不罢手”的精神。合奏的那天，七十多名乐师云集一堂，一片和谐的乐曲声给人以百家和鸣的感觉。
    “大闹龙宫”的音乐是在继承传统的前提下编成的。这些在幕后“兴风作浪”的乐师按照剧情的需要调配了乐器。如给第二场龙女出场和舞蹈配乐时，增加了云锣和乳锣，衬托出龙宫仙地的气氛，增强了水战时大海怒吼的音响，使观众仿佛身临其境。
