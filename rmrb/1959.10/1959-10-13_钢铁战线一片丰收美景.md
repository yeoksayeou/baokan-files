A Scene of Bumper Harvest on the Steel Front
As of the end of September, the output of crude steel, steel products, and pig iron has already exceeded the total output of last year.
The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to take six measures to ensure the early achievement of the annual production targets.
Xinhua News Agency, 12th – The central task of the national steel industry front in the fourth quarter is to resolutely guarantee the completion of this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. This is the battle call issued by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to the national steel industry workers at a telephone conference held on the 11th. The heads of metallurgical industry departments and bureaus of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and the heads of key steel enterprises attended the meeting.

The meeting analyzed the current production situation of the national steel industry, pointing out that the national steel production level is rising steadily and the production situation is very good. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, after the steel industry front has undergone anti-rightist and morale-boosting campaigns, and launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, the daily steel production level has increased by nearly 20,000 tons compared with two months ago, the daily iron production level has increased by more than 20,000 tons, and the daily steel production level has increased by more than 10,000 tons. By the end of September, the national steel output had already exceeded the total output of crude steel in the entire last year, and the output of pig iron and steel products had also exceeded the total output of last year. Especially in September, the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products increased even more rapidly, and everywhere was a gratifying scene of bumper harvest. Taking pig iron production as an example, the average daily production level in September increased by more than 16,000 tons compared with August. The utilization coefficients of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in key steel enterprises and small blast furnaces in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have all been significantly improved. Among them, the utilization coefficients of small blast furnaces in eight provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Zhejiang, have all reached or approached one. The quality rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces in seven provinces has reached more than 90%, gradually approaching the high-quality level of pig iron from large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide, and the quality rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces in other provinces and regions has also reached 75% to 80% or more. The coking coal consumed by blast furnace ironmaking is also continuously decreasing. The meeting pointed out that judging from the current level of steel production, as long as we go all out in the fourth quarter and launch a vigorous mass movement, this year's steel production plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

In light of the very favorable situation on the steel industry front and some new situations that have emerged after the rapid increase in steel production levels, the meeting decided to take measures in six aspects to further increase steel production levels and ensure the completion of this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule.

First, the ironmaking department is required to fully guarantee the needs of steelmaking, so that the ironmaking department supplies as much iron as the steelmaking department produces steel. To this end, ironmaking enterprises in various places are required to do everything possible to save coking coal, reduce coke consumption, and mine, transport, and reserve various raw materials more; further promote various effective advanced experiences, improve the utilization coefficient of various blast furnaces, and tap production potential. Regarding the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, while continuing to reduce the sulfur content, various places are also required to control the appropriate silicon content of pig iron according to its different uses.

Second, in terms of steelmaking production, converter steel production accounts for a large proportion in the fourth quarter. Converter steelmaking enterprises in various places are required to conscientiously promote the twelve measures for converter production that have been summarized, further improve the converter utilization coefficient and the converter steel quality rate, and further reduce pig iron consumption. Various places are required to promote the eight measures for open-hearth furnace production summarized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the advanced experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel open-hearth furnace technology performance competition, and further tap the production potential of open-hearth furnaces.

Third, in order to increase steel production, steel rolling enterprises in various places are required to conscientiously implement the advanced experience of "feeding steel from multiple lines and rapidly rolling steel"; they are required to quickly complete the production increase measures taken on some existing rolling mills in order to increase steel production; they are required to seize the time to install and put into production as soon as possible a batch of new rolling mills built in the fourth quarter, and strengthen the scheduling of steel ingots and steel billets; they are required to organize steel rolling enterprises in Anshan, Chongqing, Tianjin, and other places to strive to increase the production of light rails, steel plates, steel pipes, and wire rods.

Fourth, metallurgical departments in various provinces and regions are required to allocate pig iron according to the national plan, with good quality, in sufficient quantity, and on schedule, to support key steel enterprises in steelmaking.

Fifth, steel enterprises are required to transfer capable cadres to be responsible for the railway transportation and factory transportation of the enterprises, greatly accelerate the loading and unloading work, and actively cooperate with the railway transportation departments to create favorable conditions for busy transportation production.

Sixth, enterprises and metallurgical departments in various places are required to make preparations for winter protection against cold and frost as soon as possible.

The meeting also studied the preparations for next year's steel production, requiring metallurgical departments and metallurgical enterprises in various places to carry out preparations such as equipment maintenance, production spare parts, and grasping weak links in a planned and prepared manner, while ensuring the completion of this year's steel production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule. We must do everything possible to ensure that the steel production level in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year.

　　抓紧有利形势大搞群众运动提倡协作互助开展技术革新
　　钢铁战线一片丰收美景
　　截至九月底洋钢、钢材和生铁的产量已经超过去年总产量
　　冶金部决定采取六项措施确保提前实现全年生产指标
    新华社12日讯　第四季度全国钢铁工业战线的中心任务，是坚决保证提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁生产计划。这是冶金工业部在11日召开的电话会议上，向全国钢铁工业职工发出的战斗号召。全国各省、市、自治区冶金工业厅、局和各重点钢铁企业的负责人参加了这次会议。
    会议分析了当前全国钢铁工业生产的形势，指出目前全国钢铁生产水平蒸蒸日上，生产形势好得很。自从党的八届八中全会以后，钢铁工业战线经过反右倾、鼓干劲和展开了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，钢的日产水平比两个月前提高了将近两万吨，铁的日产水平提高了两万多吨，钢材的日产水平提高了一万多吨。到9月底为止，全国钢产量已经超过了去年全年的洋钢产量，生铁和钢材的产量也已超过了去年全年的产量。特别是在9月份，全国生铁、钢和钢材的生产提高得更加迅速，处处都是一片令人欣喜的丰收好景象。以生铁的生产为例，9月份的平均日产水平比8月份提高了一万六千多吨，各重点钢铁企业的大中型高炉和各省、市、自治区的小型高炉的利用系数，都有十分显著的提高，其中江苏、安徽、山东、浙江等八个省小高炉的利用系数，平均都达到了一以上或接近于一。已经有七个省小高炉的生铁合格率达到了90％以上，逐渐接近了全国各大中型高炉生铁合格率的优质水平，其余各省、区小高炉的生铁合格率也达到了75％以至80％以上。高炉炼铁所耗用的焦煤，也在继续不断地降低。会议指出，从现在的钢铁生产水平看来，只要在第四季度鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，今年的钢铁生产计划一定能提前超额完成。
    会议根据目前钢铁工业战线上十分有利的形势，以及钢铁生产水平迅速上升后出现的一些新情况，决定从六个方面采取措施，进一步提高钢铁生产水平，确保提前十天到十五天完成今年的钢铁生产计划。
    第一，要求炼铁部门充分保证炼钢需要，做到炼钢部门生产多少钢，炼铁部门就供应多少铁。为此，要求各地炼铁企业千方百计地节约焦煤，降低焦炭消耗，多采、多运、多储备各种原料；进一步推广各种行之有效的先进经验，提高各类高炉的利用系数，挖掘生产潜力。对于小高炉生铁的质量，要求各地在继续降低含硫量的同时，还要按照生铁的不同用途，控制生铁适当的含矽量。
    第二，在炼钢生产方面，第四季度全国转炉钢产量占有很大比重，要求各转炉炼钢企业认真推广已经总结的十二项转炉生产的措施，进一步提高转炉利用系数和转炉钢合格率，进一步降低生铁消耗量。要求各地平炉推广冶金工业部已经总结的八项平炉生产措施和鞍钢大平炉技术表演竞赛的先进经验，进一步发挥平炉的生产潜力。
    第三，为了增产钢材，要求各地轧钢企业认真贯彻执行“多条喂钢、快速轧钢”的先进经验；要求迅速完成为了增加钢材产量在原有一些轧钢机上所采取的增产措施；抓紧把第四季度新建的一批轧钢机早日安装好并投入生产，加强钢锭、钢坯的调度工作；组织鞍山、重庆、天津等地的轧钢企业，努力增产一批轻轨、钢板、钢管和线材。
    第四，要求各省、区冶金部门根据国家计划，按质、按量、按期地调出生铁，支援重点钢铁企业炼钢。
    第五，要求各钢铁企业抽调得力干部，负责作好企业的铁路运输和厂内运输，大大加快装车、卸车工作，积极协同铁道交通部门为繁忙的运输生产创造有利条件。
    第六，要求各企业和各地冶金部门及早作好冬季防寒、防冻的准备工作。
    会议还研究了明年钢铁生产的准备工作，要求各地冶金部门和冶金企业，在保证提前十天到十五天完成今年钢铁生产计划的前提下，有计划、有准备地进行设备检修、生产备品备件、抓薄弱环节等准备工作。要千方百计地做到明年第一季度钢铁生产水平，不低于今年第四季度。
