Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 18th: People of all ethnic groups in Anshun Prefecture, Guizhou Province, are launching a winter production movement on a larger scale than in 1958 to lay the foundation for a major agricultural leap forward next year.

In order to promote the continued surge in production, Anshun Prefecture recently made timely arrangements for various productions this winter and next spring, calling on all ethnic groups in the area to boost their energy and start early. Starting from November, on the basis of successfully completing the three autumn harvests, a winter production movement on a larger scale and with greater momentum than in 1958 will be launched, striving for an even greater harvest next year.

The main features of Anshun Prefecture's arrangements for winter rural work are: seizing the main measures to increase production, such as soil, fertilizer, and water, proposing to gradually promote a basic farmland system centered on deep plowing of land; vigorously carrying out basic farmland water conservancy construction; launching a mass fertilizer accumulation movement and strengthening field management of overwintering crops. It is required to make full use of last year's experience, organize deep plowing armies, and deeply plow about one foot of the one million mu of land that can be deeply plowed this year. For land that cannot be deeply plowed and land with poor soil quality, comprehensive measures such as thickening the soil layer and increasing organic fertilizer should be taken to improve the soil. In water conservancy construction, the construction of new projects and the expansion and repair of existing projects should be carried out simultaneously, continuing to implement the principle of "saving costs and achieving great results, starting with the easy and then tackling the difficult," and quickly launching a mass movement for water conservancy construction to achieve early preparation, early start, early completion, and early benefit. It is required that various places launch a mass fertilizer accumulation movement from three aspects: accumulating more farm manure, planting more green manure crops, and producing more soil fertilizer, striving for an average of 10,000 jin of high-quality base fertilizer per mu for major autumn crops next year, and 5,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu for summer crops.

The prefecture attaches great importance to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in the People's Communes, as well as the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, when arranging winter production. It requires all localities to vigorously develop forestry and animal husbandry production, vigorously engage in diversified operations and sideline production, and develop community-run industries. The entire area plans to afforest 2.5 million mu, establish large-scale livestock farms, reserve sufficient feed, and ensure a major leap forward in animal husbandry. It is required that sideline production be done more and done quickly in order to increase the income of commune members and increase the total output value of agricultural and sideline products. For various forest and local products, it is required to organize the masses to go to the mountains to pick them, and at the same time, do a good job in the purchase, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products. Community-run industries are required to further implement the principle of mainly serving agricultural production, and strive to complete the annual output value plan ahead of schedule and above quota.

The prefecture pointed out that the center of doing a good job in the above work is to properly arrange labor. Through calculating the three accounts of living paths, time, and labor, Anshun Prefecture plans to invest 80% of the 900,000 laborers in the area in agricultural production and 20% in community-run industries, transportation, and diversified operations. At the same time, it calls on the masses to vigorously engage in technological innovation, vigorously reform tools, promote advanced experiences, and do everything possible to improve labor productivity. While arranging winter production, Anshun Prefecture requires all localities to help the masses properly arrange their lives and continuously improve collective welfare undertakings such as rural public canteens and childcare organizations. Canteens should improve their management level and service quality, do a good job in sideline production such as growing vegetables and raising pigs, build more simple dining halls as much as possible, add public properties such as cooking utensils and furniture, and prepare for the winter. In arranging winter rural work, Anshun Prefecture emphasized that leaders at all levels must adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, and continue to use the successful experience of the Great Leap Forward to ensure the comprehensive victory of winter rural work.

　　水肥土为中心开展冬季生产
    安顺专区抓住农村大好形势全面安排工作
    据新华社贵阳18日电　贵州省安顺专区各族人民开展一个比1958年规模更大的、轰轰烈烈的冬季生产运动，为明年农业大跃进打下基础。
    为了推动生产高潮继续高涨，安顺专区最近及时安排了今冬明春各项生产，号召全区各族人民鼓干劲、早动手，从11月份开始，在胜利完成三秋生产任务的基础上，开展一个比1958年规模更大、声势更壮阔的冬季生产运动，争取明年更大的丰收。
    安顺专区在安排冬季农村工作中的主要特点是：抓住了土、肥、水等主要增产措施，提出要以深翻土地为中心逐步推行基本农田制；大搞农田水利基本建设；掀起群众性的积肥运动和加强越冬作物的田间管理。要求充分运用去年的经验，组织深翻大军，在今年把一百万亩能深翻的土地，深翻一尺左右，对不能深翻的土地和土质瘠瘦的土地，要采取加厚土层、增施有机质肥料等综合措施，进行土壤改良。在兴修水利中，应当新建工程和旧有工程的扩建修补同时并举，继续贯彻“费省效宏、先易后难”的原则，迅速掀起兴修水利的群众运动，做到早准备、早上马、早完工、早受益。要求各地从大积农家肥、大种绿肥作物、大搞土化肥等三方面，掀起群众性的积肥运动，争取明年大秋作物平均每亩积一万斤优质底肥，夏收作物平均每亩有五千斤追肥。
    专区在安排冬季生产时十分重视人民公社农林牧副渔五业全面发展和工农业并举的方针，要求各地大力开展林业和畜牧业生产，大搞多种经营和副业生产，发展社办工业。全区计划造林二百五十万亩，大办畜牧场，留足饲料，保证畜牧业大跃进。要求副业搞的多、搞的快，以增加社员收入和提高农副业的总产值。对各种林木土特产品要求组织群众上山采摘，同时要做好农副产品的收购和加工、调运工作。对社办工业要求进一步贯彻主要为农业生产服务的方针，争取提前超额完成全年产值计划。
    专区指出搞好以上工作的中心是妥善安排劳力。安顺专区通过算活路、时间和劳力三笔账，计划在全区九十万个劳力中，以80％投入农业生产，20％搞社办工业、交通运输、多种经营。同时号召群众大搞技术革新，大搞工具改革，推广先进经验，千方百计提高劳动生产率。在安排冬季生产的同时，安顺专区要求各地帮助群众妥善安排生活，不断改进农村公共食堂、托儿组织等集体福利事业。食堂要提高经营管理水平和服务质量，搞好种菜、养猪等副业生产，尽可能多修建一些简易饭厅，添置炊具、家具等公共财产，做好过冬准备，安顺专区在安排冬季农村工作中，强调各级领导必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，继续运用大跃进的成功经验，以保证冬季农村工作的全面胜利。
