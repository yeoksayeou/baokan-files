    收音、电唱、录音三用
    南京无线电厂试制成功一种收音、电唱、录音三用特级“熊猫牌”落地式收音机，并已成批投入生产。这种收音机有现代流线式美和我国独特的民族风格。它有精致漂亮的木壳，色彩调和，引人喜爱。
    这种收音机共采用了十五个电子管和一个半导体管，有一个中波段、四个短波段和一个超短波段。
    为了增加机器的美观，减少噪音干扰，在设计时采用了机内天线、静电隔离罩等现代化的无线电装置。另外机内有四只高低音扬声器，声音宏亮，音质柔和，具有立体声的感觉。
    这种产品的电唱部分是一架完整的自动电唱机，它有四种转速，每次可连续放十张唱片，当唱完最后一张时，能够自动关闭。录音部分是一架新型磁带录音机，可以往复双轨录音和放音，使用方便，电性能良好。
