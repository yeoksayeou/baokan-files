    The Leaping Forward Drums Beat Louder and Louder
    Production Records Refreshed Daily
    Heilongjiang's Million Workers Propose Over 370,000 Technical Innovation Suggestions
    Hubei Proposes Several Measures to Continue Deepening the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    Guangxi Sweeps Away Rightist Tendencies and Breaks the Theory of "Production Reaching Its Peak," Production Upsurge Continues to Develop
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an industrial conference in mid-October with the participation of industrial ministers of the regional (municipal) committees and commissioners and mayors in charge of industry.
    The conference called on the province's million-plus workers to seize the current excellent situation and favorable opportunity to complete this year's production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule.
    The conference analyzed the excellent situation of mass movements and the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in the province's industrial enterprises. It unanimously agreed that the characteristics of the new upsurge are: taking anti-Rightism as the guiding principle; the movement's momentum is strong, development is rapid, production is rising in a straight line, breaking the past routine of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end; and a new situation of comprehensive leap forward that is both vigorous and down-to-earth has emerged. At the beginning of the movement in August, the province's total industrial output value increased by 9.98% compared with July; in September, the movement entered a high tide, and the total output value for the month increased sharply by 29.28% compared with August. Now the increase production and practice economy movement in the province's industrial enterprises is both vigorous and down-to-earth. More than 30,000 advanced individuals and more than 2,000 advanced collectives have emerged in the province. In August and September, workers across the province put forward more than 370,000 technical innovation and rationalization proposals.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a telephone conference of industrial secretaries of the regional, municipal, and county committees and party secretaries of large factories and mines, requesting all localities to thoroughly combat Rightism, boost morale, and strive to complete this year's total industrial output value plan one month ahead of schedule and the output plan of major products fifteen days ahead of schedule, and to prepare for production and capital construction in the first quarter of next year.
    The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party brought a huge force to industrial and transportation enterprises in Hubei Province. Right-leaning slackening thoughts were criticized, and a vigorous increase production and practice economy upsurge quickly formed throughout the province. The province's total industrial output value increased by 14.4% in August compared with July, and then surged by 48% in September compared with August, and then increased by 12.46% in early October compared with the peak in late September.
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires party organizations in industrial and transportation enterprises throughout the province to seize this great opportunity, advance victoriously, and resolutely carry the struggle against Right opportunism through to the end.
    In order to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement in a deep and lasting manner, the Hubei Provincial Committee also proposed to strengthen the education of the General Line. In terms of technological revolution and technological innovation, it is required to fully implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and moving from indigenous to foreign methods, and pay attention to the workers' slightest creations.
    In terms of strengthening enterprise management, all factories and enterprises are required to apply the successful experience of strengthening enterprise management this year, adopt the mass line method on the basis of carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and continuously strengthen enterprise management according to production needs.
    (Reported by this newspaper, Nanning, 29th) The more than 300,000 workers of all ethnic groups on the industrial and transportation front in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, on the basis of achieving brilliant achievements in the great battle of August and September, have resolutely broken the theory of "production reaching its peak," and are bravely advancing with the vigor of running iron and steel on a large scale, determined to fight the fourth quarter and strive to comprehensively complete this year's industrial production plan one month ahead of schedule.
    The masses' enthusiasm is soaring, and production is booming, which is the general summary of the economic front in the autonomous region. In terms of production and capital construction, the total industrial output value increased by 19.58% in August compared with July, and then increased by 30.61% in September compared with August. Sixty-five major products such as raw coal and pig iron overfulfilled the third quarter plan. The completed workload of capital construction increased by 13.3% in August compared with July, and by 35.8% in September compared with August. The entire production and construction has comprehensively completed the plan, and September created the highest production level since this year. Through in-depth study of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session and the spirit of the regional party committee's three-level cadre meeting, combined with summarizing the production experience of the great battle in August and September, and linking with thoughts and reality, a resolute and powerful criticism of Right-leaning conservative ideas was carried out. Many regions and factories and mines launched a big airing of views, a big debate, and debated topics such as "Do we want the General Line?", "Do we want the Great Leap Forward?", and "Do we want to complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule?". Through the debate, various erroneous ideas were swept away, and the political awareness of the workers was further raised, which not only enabled the already formed production upsurge to continue to develop, but also made the drums of the leap forward beat louder and louder, and production records were refreshed daily.
    At present, each special zone and city has hundreds and thousands of advanced teams, groups, and advanced individuals who have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics from four cities, the Liuzhou Railway Administration, and the Pinggui Mining Bureau, etc., as of October 10, 12,217 young workers have completed the annual production tasks ahead of schedule and victoriously entered 1960.

    黑龙江百万职工提出三十七万多件技术革新建议

    广西横扫右倾大破增产到顶论生产高潮持续发展
    本报讯　中共黑龙江省委在10月中旬召开了地（市）委工业部长和主管工业的专员、市长参加的工业会议。
    会议号召全省一百多万职工抓住当前大好形势和有利时机，提前十五天到二十天完成今年生产计划。
    会议分析了当前全省工业企业大搞群众运动、开展增产节约运动的大好形势，一致认为：新高潮的特点是，以反右倾为纲；运动来势猛、发展快，生产直线上升，打破了过去月初松、月末紧的常规；出现了既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实全面跃进的新局面。在8月份运动掀起之初，全省工业产值就比7月份增长了9.98％；9月份，运动进入高潮，全月产值又比8月份猛增29.28％。现在全省工业企业的增产节约运动，既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实。全省已出现了三万多个先进人物和两千多个先进集体，8、9月份，全省职工就提出了三十七万多件技术革新和合理化建议。
    本报讯　中共湖北省委在最近召开了全省地委、市委、县委工业书记和大型厂矿党委书记电话会议，要求各地深入反右倾、鼓干劲，力争提前一个月完成今年的工业总产值计划和提前十五天完成今年的主要产品产量计划，并做好明年第一季度的生产和基本建设的准备工作。
    党的八届八中全会决议给湖北省工业交通企业带来了一股巨大的力量，右倾松劲思想遭到批判，一个声势浩大的增产节约高潮迅速在全省形成。全省工业总产值8月份比7月份增长14.4％，9月份又比8月份猛增48％，10月上旬又比高峰的9月下旬增加12.46％。

    为了把增产节约运动深入持久地开展下去，湖北省委还提出要加强总路线教育，在技术革命和技术革新方面，要求全面贯彻多快好省的方针，贯彻土洋并举、由土到洋的方针，注意职工的点滴创造。
    在加强企业管理方面，要求各工厂企业适用今年加强企业管理的成功经验，在大搞群众运动的基础上，采取群众路线的方法，根据生产需要，不断加强企业管理。
    本报南宁29日电　广西僮族自治区工业、交通战线三十多万各族职工，在大战8、9月取得辉煌成就的基础上，大破“增产到顶”论，以大办钢铁的劲头奋勇前进，决战第四季度，争取提前一个月全面完成今年工业生产计划。
    群众干劲冲天，生产蒸蒸日上，这是自治区经济战线总的形势的概括。就生产和基建情况来看，工业总产值8月比7月增长19.58％，9月份又比8月份增长30.61％。原煤、生铁等六十五种主要产品超额完成了第三季度计划。基本建设完成工作量8月比7月增长13.3％，9月比8月增长35.8％，整个生产建设都比较全面的完成了计划，9月份创今年以来最高生产水平。各地通过深入地学习八中全会决议和区党委三级干部会议的精神，结合总结大战8、9月的生产经验，联系思想，联系实际，对右倾保守思想进行了坚决有力的批判。许多地区和厂矿展开了大鸣大放大辩论，辩论了“要不要总路线”、“要不要大跃进”、“要不要提前一个月完成全年生产计划”等课题。通过辩论，横扫各种错误思想，职工们的政治觉悟更加高涨，不仅使已经形成的生产高潮持续发展下去，而且跃进的锣鼓越敲越响，生产纪录日日刷新。
    目前，各专区、市都有成百上千的先进班、组和先进个人提前完成了今年生产计划，据四个市及柳州铁路管理局、平桂矿务局等不完全统计，到10月10日止，已有一万二千二百一十七名青年职工提前完成全年的生产任务后，胜利地跨进了1960年。
