Xinhua News Agency, October 8th—Guinea's government representative, Minister of Education Barry Diawandou, said in a farewell speech at Beijing Airport today: The establishment of diplomatic relations and the signing of the first cultural cooperation agreement between China and Guinea provides an example that conforms to the Bandung spirit. Other independent African countries should follow this example so that we can enter a new era of establishing friendly relations between our countries.

Minister Diawandou left Beijing by plane this afternoon to return home. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and other government officials went to the airport to see him off. In his farewell speech, Minister Diawandou said enthusiastically: "I am about to return home. At this difficult moment, at this moment of saying goodbye to you and, through you, to the united and friendly Chinese people, I would like to tell you again in the name of my country how warmly I was welcomed by people of all walks of life during my stay in the People's Republic of China! The Republic of Guinea, a black African country that once lived under foreign rule, yearns for the effective experience gained by the Chinese people!"

The Guinean guest's friendly and passionate speech aroused warm applause at the airport.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then delivered a speech to bid farewell to the distinguished guests from Africa, thanking him for coming to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on behalf of the Guinean government, and asking him to convey the Chinese people's friendship and greetings to the Guinean people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech: "During Your Excellency's stay in Beijing, we held friendly talks together and issued a joint communiqué on the formal establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors between the two countries. China and Guinea also signed a cultural cooperation agreement and exchanged views on developing trade relations between the two countries. All of these have laid a good foundation for the future development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea. I am confident that the friendly relations between China and Guinea will be further developed and strengthened in the future."

Before the speech, the band played the national anthems of Guinea and China. Minister Diawandou, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, reviewed the guard of honor. The Guinean guest received flowers presented to him by the Young Pioneers of the capital.

Those who went to the airport to see him off today included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Education Liu Aifeng, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Lu Xuzhang, heads of various government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.
