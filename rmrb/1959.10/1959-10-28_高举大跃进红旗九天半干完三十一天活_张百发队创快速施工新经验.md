Raising the Red Flag of the Great Leap Forward, Completing Thirty-One Days of Work in Nine and a Half Days
Zhang Baifa Team Creates New Experience in Rapid Construction
Their experience is: Putting politics in command, everyone is conscious; scheduling progress by the hour, not wasting a second; preparing early, acting fast, unity between upper and lower processes; launching competitions, striving for skillful work, everyone strives to be first

(By our staff reporter) The renowned Zhang Baifa steel bar youth shock brigade, in their recent two months of construction work, due to putting politics in command and fully leveraging a highly conscious sense of ownership, adopted a method of internal assessment of individual Great Leap Forward targets combined with scientific organization of production, greatly increasing labor efficiency. Entering October, they completed the entire month's production plan in nine and a half days of scheduled work time. The quality was all first-class. Now, this high-speed construction experience has been promoted among 150,000 workers on the Beijing basic construction front. The Zhang Baifa team was recently elected as a representative to the National "Heroes Conference."

The high-speed construction record created by the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade proves that a continuous Great Leap Forward can be achieved within the specified working time. The team's experience can be summarized into six points: First, emphasize tasks, boost morale, put politics in command; study blueprints, calculate detailed accounts, discuss plans. Second, divide processes, consciously set Great Leap Forward quotas; schedule progress by the hour, fight for every second. Third, start early, prepare thoroughly, be as comprehensive as possible; leave difficulties behind, offer convenience, collaborate up and down. Fourth, discuss conditions, according to specialties, rationally divide labor; soldier against soldier, general against general, launch competitions. Fifth, establish models, set standards, comply with regulations; control well, inspect diligently, quality first. Sixth, compare skillful work, learn from advanced, by all means; work like working, rest like resting, combine work and rest.

The process of creating this construction experience is as follows: In late August of this year, when the team was binding steel bars for large roof panels at the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company's component factory, the original plan was to bind 653 panels in nine days. After six days of binding, they found that only 50% had been completed. At that time, the team members were studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and everyone recognized that in order to get rid of the backward state of "poor and blank" in the economy as soon as possible, they must seize every second for socialist construction. After studying, team member Wang Zequan was determined not to waste a minute. He used a watch to determine the time required to bind each roof panel. After technical analysis and detailed calculations, he calculated that he could complete about 150 panels per day, reaching two and a half times the quota. The next day, according to the assessed time, he carefully prepared for production, accurately arranged his labor by the minute and second, and as a result, achieved a maximum record of 150 panels per day.

This matter greatly inspired all the team members. After discussion, everyone believed that this approach could strengthen everyone's sense of time, so that they would be clear in their minds and fight for every second. From then on, when they accepted each task, they first selected a few team members to experiment, using the standard of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results to determine the time required to complete the task. Then, the team members consciously formulated Great Leap Forward targets according to their own levels, treating the state-stipulated targets as the minimum requirement. After overfulfilling the tasks, they promptly raised the Great Leap Forward targets to achieve continuous leaps forward.

After consciously formulating Great Leap Forward targets, the team immediately launched a variety of competition forms according to the nature of the task, mobilizing everyone to use their brains to find tricks and carry out technical innovations on a large scale, so that the targets leaped again and again. In organizing the competition movement under the name of "Games," they organized singles matches for processes suitable for individual operation, doubles matches for processes suitable for two-person operation, and team matches for larger groups. This form made the team's morale even more vigorous, and everyone was full of energy, so that most processes had innovations. For example, in one competition, the Great Leap Forward target for bending stirrups was 1,600, 50% higher than the national quota. The first day of the competition, team member Chu Zhentang created the highest score of 1,836. The next day, Han Zhenxue, who was last, learned from Chu Zhentang's experience, improved five tools, and bent 2,037, surpassing Chu Zhentang. On the third day, another competition was organized to break the record, reaching a maximum of 3,100.

While new records were constantly emerging, the team promptly tightened the quality control gate and established the idea of quality first. On the one hand, they created and promoted some measuring tools and molds to make the products more standardized. On the other hand, they mobilized the masses to establish a quality supervision system. The quality of each task reached excellent. Because they were able to continuously leap forward within the specified working time, they greatly overfulfilled the plan. Now, the team has achieved a balance between work and rest, ensuring time for learning culture and technology. The team members said: "This way, work is like work, rest is like rest, the task is completed, and the mood is cheerful."

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to this high-speed construction experience. On the 24th, it convened a city-wide cadre meeting of basic construction departments and teams, calling on basic construction workers to learn from this construction experience and set off an even greater Great Leap Forward upsurge.

    高举大跃进红旗九天半干完三十一天活
    张百发队创快速施工新经验
    他们的经验是：政治挂帅，个个自觉；按小时排进度，分秒不让；准备早，动手快，上下工序一条心；搞竞赛，比巧干，人人争先
    本报讯　著名的张百发钢筋工青年突击队在最近两个月的施工工作中，由于政治挂帅，充分发挥了高度自觉的主人翁态度，采取队内查定个人跃进指标和科学地组织生产相结合的方法，大大提高了劳动效率。进入10月份，用九天半的规定作业时间，完成了全月的生产计划。质量全部都是一级品。现在，这项高速度的施工经验，已经在北京基本建设战线十五万职工中推广。张百发队最近又当选了全国“群英会”的代表。
    张百发青年突击队创造的高速度施工纪录，证明在规定的作业时间内能够做到持续不断的大跃进。这个队的经验归纳起来有六项：一、讲任务、鼓干劲，政治挂帅；学图纸，算细账，讨论计划。二、分工序，自觉地订跃进定额；按小时排进度，分秒必争。三、早下手，作准备，尽量周到；留困难，送方便，上下协作。四、论条件，按特长，合理分工；兵对兵，将对将，展开竞赛。五、树样板，订标准，遵守规程；把好关，勤检查，质量第一。六、比巧干，学先进，千方百计；干像干，歇像歇，劳逸结合。
    创造这项施工经验的过程是这样：今年8月下旬，这个队在北京市第三建筑工程公司构件厂绑扎大型屋面板的钢筋时，原先计划九天内绑扎六百五十三块，绑扎了六天，发现才完成50％。当时，队员们正在学习八届八中全会的决议，大家都认识到要早日摆脱经济上“一穷二白”的落后状态，必须分秒必争地进行社会主义建设。学习以后，队员王泽泉立志要做到不浪费一分一秒时间，他用手表查定每绑扎一块屋面板所需的时间，经过技术分析，算细账，计算出每天大约能完成一百五十块，达到定额的二倍半。第二天，他根据查定的时间，细致地做好生产准备工作，按分秒准确地安排自己劳动，结果达到了日产一百五十块的最高纪录。
    这件事情给全体队员很大启发。经过讨论，大家认为这种做法能够加强每个人的时间观念，做到心里有数，分秒必争。从这以后，他们在接受每一项任务时，都是先抽出几个队员作试验，用鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的标准来查定完成这项任务所需的时间，然后由队员们按照自己的水平，自觉地制定跃进指标，而把国家规定的指标当作起码的最低要求，等到超额完成任务后，他们又及时提高跃进指标，做到不断的跃进。
    在自觉地制定跃进指标以后，这个队就立刻根据任务性质，开展多种多样的竞赛形式，发动大家动脑筋找窍门，大搞技术革新，使指标一跃再跃。他们在组织“运动会”为名的竞赛运动中，适合单独操作的工序组织单打赛，适合双人操作的组织双打赛，人多的就组织团体赛。这种形式使全队的斗志更加旺盛，个个干劲冲天，做到大部分工序都有革新。比如在一次比赛中，弯套箍的跃进指标是一千六百个，比国家定额高50％。第一天比赛结果，队员褚振堂创造的最高成绩是一千八百三十六个，第二天最后一名的韩振学学习了褚振堂的经验，改进了五项工具，弯了二千零三十七个，超过了褚振堂。第三天，又组织了一次刷新纪录的竞赛，最高达到三千一百个。
    在新纪录不断涌现的同时，这个队及时把紧质量关口，确定了质量第一的思想。他们一方面创造和推行了一些量具、模具，使产品做到更加规格化。另一方面，发动群众建立了一套质量监督制度。项项任务的质量都达到了优良。由于能够在规定的作业时间内持续不断地跃进，大大地超额完成计划。现在，这个队做到了有劳有逸，保证了学文化、学技术的时间。队员们说：“这一来干像干，歇像歇，任务完成，心情舒畅。”
    中共北京市委十分重视这项高速度施工的经验，24日，召开全市基本建设部门队组干部大会，号召基本建设职工学习这项施工经验，掀起一个更大的跃进高潮。
