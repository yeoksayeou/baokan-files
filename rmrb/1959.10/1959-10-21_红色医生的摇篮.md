    Cradle of Red Doctors
    Shenyang Medical College, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, was formerly the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Health School, founded by the Party in the Jiangxi Soviet Area in 1931. For twenty-eight years, this school has consistently followed the instructions given to it by the Party and Chairman Mao: "Cultivate Red doctors who are politically firm and technically excellent." It has continuously developed and grown, and has trained nearly 20,000 health work cadres. (Photos attached)

    红色医生的摇篮
    有着光荣革命传统的沈阳医学院，它的前身是党在1931年创建于江西苏区的中国工农红军卫生学校。二十八年来，这所学校一直遵照着党和毛主席给它的指示：“培养政治坚定、技术优良的红色医生”，不断发展壮大，已培养了近两万名卫生工作干部。（附图片）
