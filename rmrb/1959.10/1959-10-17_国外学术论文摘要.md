    The Increasing Role of Mental Labor in Production
    In the history of social development, the content of the concept "producers of material goods" has undergone significant changes. If the productive forces of primitive society were all members of society, then with the emergence of the social division of labor, some members of society were no longer producers of material goods. Mental laborers, whether Greek philosophers, medieval scientists, or 17th-century mathematicians, were not included in the social productive forces. Only manual laborers were considered social productive forces. However, expending physical strength to directly act upon the object of labor, or performing physical labor to oversee machines, is no longer a universal characteristic of those who constitute social productive forces. For modern production, especially for automated production processes, this standard is insufficient because machines directly act upon the object of labor, and the processing of raw materials into finished products does not require the direct use of workers' hands.
    In large-scale industry, due to the adoption of machines and the socialization of labor, the production process inevitably generates functions that primarily require the application of human mental labor, such as monitoring the operation of machines and continuously improving them.
    Developed large-scale production includes scientific labor, which is a necessary condition for the development of the industrial production process. This labor, along with the direct physical activity of workers, creates material wealth. Scientific workers who work in industrial enterprise laboratories and scientific research institutions, serving the field of material production, are also included in the entire collective of workers.
    It can be asserted that scientific labor in some new industrial sectors already has the significance of direct productive labor. For example, controlling and monitoring nuclear processes in atomic reactors requires the use of scientific labor. The same is true for the labor used to control electronic computers. Under these conditions, scientific workers become production personnel who oversee and monitor the operation of machines.
    The increasing role of mental labor in production is related to the fundamental change in the nature of human labor that creates material goods.
    Initially, living human labor was the primary source of power. People directly performed all labor operations, using labor tools and controlling the labor process. People's physical strength was the basic factor of production. Large-scale machine industry brought great changes to labor functions. It replaced the function of directly using hand tools with machine systems, thereby making the activity of overseeing machines and controlling the production process the main form of direct labor.
    Now, human and animal power, as sources of power, account for only about 1% of the world's power production. The proportion of hand tools has been greatly reduced. Therefore, in modern highly mechanized production, labor can be reduced to two main functions: overseeing machines (the work of machine tool operators) and controlling machines and the production process. The former function is mainly physical, and the latter is mainly mental.
    The task put forward by communism is to free production from the heavy and laborious direct physical labor of overseeing machines and partly from the labor of controlling machines. To achieve this, production automation must be realized. Under the conditions of production automation, workers do not directly participate in the production process, which is carried out by automatic machine systems. Automatically working machine systems perform various production functions without direct human participation, requiring only workers to carry out repairs and adjustments. In addition, humans have a function, which is to supervise the automatons, which is essentially mental work.
    Production automation makes the manual labor of overseeing machines superfluous. The predominant role will be the labor of monitoring machine operation and adjusting instruments. Creative work of supervising and controlling automatons, as well as inventing and improving automatons, will become the field of mental labor that organizes production. Mental labor combined with slight physical labor will be "direct productive" labor.
    Of course, this activity will also require direct labor, i.e., physical labor in the original sense (although of a different nature), because even in fully automated production, a certain amount of human physical strength is needed. However, this direct living labor will no longer be the main basis of production.
    Undoubtedly, physical labor freed from purely mechanical functions and enriched by creative intellectual content will also be preserved under the communist system. We are only talking about the incomparable lightening of physical labor.
    Mental labor in production must be freed from many of the most tiring and monotonous functions and mainly engage in creative exploration. Machines that replace or lighten mental labor make it possible to expand the scale of invention and the entire scientific creation enterprise.
    Therefore, in the production process, the significance of the intellectual aspect of labor is becoming greater and greater, and the laborers who are the main productive forces of society will become engineering and technical personnel, while they must combine their activities with some physical labor.

    The Comprehensive Development of Man and the Elimination of the Division of Labor
    The mission of communism is to produce a new type of worker that cannot be produced under capitalism. The posing of this question is also required by a well-known principle of historical materialism, which is: socio-economic formations are not distinguished by what is produced, but by how it is produced, and with what means of labor it is produced.
    What new characteristics does the material and technical foundation of communism have? What are the characteristics of technological progress today? The most important direction of technological progress at this stage is comprehensive mechanization and automation, electrification, and chemicalization.
    Complete and perfect automation is only suitable for the nature of the communist system and is absolutely incompatible with capitalism. The most developed capitalist countries may temporarily surpass socialist countries in the cause of automation, but complete and perfect automation can only be implemented by communist society in the end. Complete production automation is also the most important prerequisite for cultivating comprehensively developed individuals. Automation will inevitably cause fundamental changes in the nature of labor and the type of worker because it requires not merely simple technical "adaptation" based on general experience knowledge of machinery, but requires understanding of the scientific principles of production. This means that everyone engaged in material production should become engineering and technical personnel, and thus the division of labor between manual and mental laborers should be eliminated.
    Automation will have even more far-reaching consequences. The division of labor between mental and manual labor is only one aspect of the division of labor. Marx talked about the division of labor related to the division of social production and determined the difference between general division of labor, special division of labor, and single division of labor. Marxist-Leninist classical writers have repeatedly and directly talked about the elimination of these kinds of divisions of labor. Eliminating the existing division of labor cannot be understood as everyone engaging in any kind of labor to the same extent and with the same effectiveness, that the differences between various productions will be eliminated, but should be understood as people no longer being bound to one profession, being able to combine manual labor and mental labor, combine industrial labor and agricultural labor, and combine one activity with another. The development of modern science and technology and the practice of communist construction prove that things are developing in this direction.
    Perfect automation will create a high degree of labor productivity, thus freeing up a large amount of time currently spent on material production. This creates many possibilities to engage in work in the field of material production on the one hand, and to engage in activities in the fields of art, science, education, etc. on the other hand. This phenomenon is already appearing.
    The all-encompassing knowledge of ancient people was largely based on a relatively low level of scientific development. With the development of science, science has also become increasingly divided, so that specialties have increased and become more subdivided. Under these circumstances, all-encompassing knowledge has become superficial. However, the further development of science and the continued subdivision of science today have also developed the trend of scientific synthesis. The need for all-encompassing knowledge has grown again on a new basis.
    The comprehensive development of the individual does not mean that a person becomes an omnipotent doctor, but that they have a certain breadth of knowledge so that they can engage not only in activities in the field of material production, but also in activities in the field of spiritual production. Naturally, the law of labor change, the change of functions, does not mean that a person can engage in any department of labor with the same effectiveness.

　　国外学术论文摘要
　　编者按：1959年第十期“学术译丛”今日出版，下面是其中两篇译文的摘要。
    脑力劳动在生产中的作用的增长
    在社会发展历史中，“物质资料生产者”这个概念的内容发生了重大变化。如果说原始社会制度的生产力是社会的全体成员，那么随着社会分工的产生，一部分社会成员就不再是物质资料生产者了。脑力劳动者，不管是希腊的哲学家也好，中世纪的科学家或十七世纪的数学家也好，都不包括在社会生产力之内。只有体力劳动者才是社会生产力。但是，为直接作用于劳动对象而花费体力，为看管机器而进行体力劳动，也不是构成社会生产力的人们的普遍特征。对于现代生产来说，特别是对于自动化的生产过程来说，这条标准就不够了，因为在这里是用机器来直接作用于劳动对象，把原料进行加工和变成成品也不需要直接利用工人的双手。
    在大工业中，由于采用机器和劳动社会化，生产过程必然产生一些需要主要是应用人的脑力的职能，如监督机器的工作，不断改进机器等等。
    发达的大生产包括着科学劳动，这种劳动是工业生产过程发展的必要条件。这种劳动同工人的直接的体力活动一道创造物质财富。在工业企业试验室和科学研究机关里工作的、为物质生产领域服务的科学工作者，也包括在全部的工人集体之内。
    可以断定，目前科学劳动在某些新的工业部门就已具有直接生产劳动的意义。例如，控制和监督原子反应堆里的核子过程，就需要使用科学劳动。控制电子计算机所使用的劳动也是如此。在这种条件下，科学工作者就变成看管和监督机器工作的生产人员。
    脑力劳动在生产中的作用的增长，同创造物质资料的人类劳动的性质的根本变化有关。
    起初，人的活劳动是主要的力源。人直接进行一切劳动操作，使用劳动工具和控制劳动过程。人们的体力是生产的基本因素。大机器工业给劳动职能带来很大变化。大机器工业用机器系统代替了直接使用手工工具的职能，从而使看管机器和控制生产过程的活动成为直接劳动的主要形式。
    现在，人力和畜力作为力源来说，只占世界动力生产的1％左右。手工工具的比重大大减少了。因此，在现代高度机械化的生产中，劳动可以归结为两种主要职能：看管机器（机床工人的工作）与控制机器和生产过程。其中第一种职能主要是体力职能，第二种职能主要是脑力职能。
    共产主义提出的任务是使生产摆脱看管机器的繁重费力的直接体力劳动和部分地摆脱控制机器的劳动。要达到这一点，就要实现生产自动化。在生产自动化条件下，工作者不直接参加生产过程，生产过程由自动机系统来进行。自动工作的机器系统执行着各种各样的生产职能，不要人直接参加，只要工人进行修理和调整工作，此外，人还有一个职能，就是监督自动机，这实质上是脑力工作。
    生产自动化使看管机器的手工劳动成为多余的事情。占主要地位的将是监督机器工作和调整仪器的劳动。监督和控制自动机，以及发明和改进自动机的创造性工作，就成为组织生产的脑力劳动的领域。同轻微体力劳动相结合的脑力劳动将是“直接的生产的”劳动。
    当然，这种活动也将要求有直接劳动即原来意义上的体力劳动（虽然具有不同的性质），因为即使在完全自动化生产中也需要有人的一定的体力。但是，这种直接的活劳动将不再是生产的主要基础。
    毫无疑问，摆脱了纯粹机械职能的、由创造性智力内容充实起来的体力劳动，在共产主义制度下也会保存下来。我们谈的只是体力劳动的无比减轻。
    生产中的脑力劳动要摆脱许多最累人的和单调的职能，主要是从事创造性的探求。代替或减轻脑力劳动的机器，使得有可能扩大发明事业和整个科学创造事业的规模。
    因此，在生产过程中，劳动的智力方面的意义就越来越大，而作为社会主要生产力的劳动者将成为工程技术人员，同时他们要把自己的活动同某些体力劳动结合起来。

    人的全面发展和分工的消灭问题
    共产主义的使命，是要产生资本主义条件下所不能产生的新型工作者。这个问题的提出，也是历史唯物主义的一个著名原理所要求的，这个原理就是：社会经济形态不是以生产什么来区分，而是以怎样生产，用什么样的劳动手段生产来区分的。
    共产主义的物质技术基础具有什么新的特征呢？今天技术进步的特点是什么呢？现阶段技术进步的最重要的方向，是全盘机械化和自动化、电力化和化学化。
    完全的完善的自动化只适合于共产主义制度的性质，而和资本主义绝不相容。最发达的资本主义国家在自动化的事业上能够一时超过社会主义国家，但是完全的完善的自动化终究只有共产主义社会能够实行。完全的生产自动化也就是培养全面发展的个性的最重要的前提。自动化必然会引起劳动性质和工作者类型的根本变化，因为它所要求的不是仅仅以对机械的一般经验知识为基础的单纯技术上的“适应”，而是要求通晓生产的科学原理。这就是说，一切从事物质生产的人都应该成为工程技术人员，因而也就应该消灭体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的分工。
    自动化会产生更深远的后果。脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工仅仅是分工的一个方面。马克思曾谈到与社会生产的区分有关的分工，确定了一般分工、特殊分工和单一分工之间的区别。马克思列宁主义经典著作家曾经多次地直截了当地谈到这几种分工的消灭。消灭现有的分工，不能理解为每个人都将同等程度地和同样有效地从事任何一种劳动，各种生产之间的区别将会消灭，而应当理解为人们将不再束缚于一种职业，能够把体力劳动和脑力劳动结合起来，把工业劳动和农业劳动结合起来，把一种活动和另一种活动结合起来。现代科学技术的发展和共产主义建设的实践证明，事情正向这方面发展。
    完善的自动化将会创造出高度的劳动生产率，因而会把现在从事物质生产的大量时间腾出来。这样就有很多可能一面从事物质生产方面的工作，一面从事艺术、科学、教育等等方面的活动。这种现象现在就已经出现。
    古代人的包罗万象的知识在很大程度上是建立在比较低的科学发展水平上的。随着科学的发展，科学也分得愈来愈细，因而专业也增多和分细了。在这种情况下，包罗万象就变成了浅尝辄止。可是科学进一步的发展和科学在今天的继续分细，又发展了科学综合的趋势。对包罗万象的知识的需要又在新的基础上增长起来。
    个人全面发展决不是说要人变成一个万能博士，而是说要具有一定广度的知识，以便能够不仅从事物质生产方面的活动，而且从事精神生产方面的活动。自然，劳动变更的规律，职能的变动，并不意味着一个人会同样有效地从事任何部门的劳动。（摘自加克〔苏联〕：“共产主义建设和个性的全面发展”）
