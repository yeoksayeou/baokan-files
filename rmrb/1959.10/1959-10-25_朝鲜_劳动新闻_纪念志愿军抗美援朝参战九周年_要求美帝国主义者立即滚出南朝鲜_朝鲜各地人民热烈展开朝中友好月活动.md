Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd -- The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published today an article by Korean People's Army General Choe Yong-jin: "Eternal Friendship and Solidarity Between the People of Korea and China," commemorating the ninth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

Under the banner headline "The Great Achievements of the Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army Remaining on Korean Territory Will Forever Shine," the third page of the newspaper published many reports and pictures about the friendship between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people.

General Choe Yong-jin's article recounted that on October 25, 1950, under the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, finally driving US imperialism south of the 38th parallel, staunchly defending the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and making significant contributions to defending peace in the Far East and the world.

The article said that after eight years of sharing weal and woe with the Korean people in Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on October 25 of last year, voluntarily withdrew from Korea based on the proposals of the governments of Korea and China, opening up a new situation for the peaceful reunification of Korea and making a great contribution to easing tensions in the Far East.

Choe Yong-jin said that US imperialism still occupies South Korea and Taiwan, and continues to carry out new military provocation conspiracies. It disregards the protests and condemnations of the people of the world, turning South Korea into its colony and atomic war base, destroying and trampling on the armistice agreement.

General Choe Yong-jin emphasized that US imperialists must immediately stop playing with fire in South Korea and Taiwan. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has withdrawn from Korea for a year, and it no longer has any excuse to stay in South Korea. It must get out of South Korea and Taiwan.

The article concluded that the Korean people, under the banner of proletarian internationalism, will make every effort to further strengthen the traditional friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th -- The "Korea-China Friendship Month" activities, launched by the Korean people on October 1st to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, have been unfolding in a colorful and extensive manner for more than twenty days. As the meaningful day of the ninth anniversary of the entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into Korea and the first anniversary of their victorious return home (October 25th) approaches, this activity has formed a new climax.

In recent days, Pyongyang newspapers have published articles and poems, and published special issues, praising Korea-China friendship and the achievements of the Volunteer Army in Korea. The literary and art circles of Pyongyang recently held a Chinese literature evening, a Chinese art evening, and a Korea-China friendship evening. Prominent Korean writers Han Seol-ya and Song Young, artists Lee Myeon-sang and Jeong Gwan-cheol, and composer Kim Kyung-soo all participated in the Friendship Month activities.

At these evenings, people introduced the development of Chinese literature and art over the past decade, and the cultural exchanges between Korea and China.

Starting tomorrow, the Korean music circles will also hold a week-long Chinese Music Week. Composer Kim Kyung-soo and poet Kang Rip-seok recently wrote a "Song of Korea-China Friendship," in which they enthusiastically praised the friendship between the people of the two countries and their common leap forward: "The galloping hooves of the Chollima in Pyongyang shake the earth, the light of the Great Leap Forward in Beijing shines on the sky, sing! Sing! Sing of Korea-China friendship, how happy we are to be walking on a glorious road."

The delegation of the China-Korea Friendship Association, invited to visit Korea, participated in the "Korea-China Friendship Month" activities held in various parts of Korea, and received a warm welcome.

In these days, the Korean working people, who have deep feelings for the Chinese people, are strengthening and developing their friendship with the Chinese people in various forms. The members of the Sangyang Agricultural Cooperative, which Premier Zhou Enlai visited during his visit to Korea last year, recently named their cooperative the Korea-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative. The workers of the Sinuiju Enamel Factory, built with the assistance of the Chinese people, have recently increased their output to more than four times the initial stage of the factory's construction. They wrote letters to the Shanghai workers who initially provided technical assistance to the factory, congratulating them on the festival and reporting on their new production achievements.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”纪念志愿军抗美援朝参战九周年
    要求美帝国主义者立即滚出南朝鲜
    朝鲜各地人民热烈展开朝中友好月活动
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天刊载了朝鲜人民军上将崔勇进的文章：“朝中两国人民之间的永恒的友谊团结”，纪念中国人民志愿军抗美援朝参战九周年。
    这家报纸第三版在“英雄的中国人民志愿军留在朝鲜疆土上的伟大功勋永放光芒”的通栏标题下，刊登了许多关于志愿军同朝鲜人民的友谊的通讯和图片。
    崔勇进上将的文章追述，1950年10月25日，中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝保家卫国的旗帜下，进入朝鲜同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，最后把美帝国主义赶到三八线以南，钢铁般地保卫了社会主义阵营的东方前哨，对保卫远东和世界和平作出了重大贡献。
    文章说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜同朝鲜人民经过了八年的同甘苦同患难以后，在去年10月25日根据朝中两国政府的建议，主动地从朝鲜撤出，为朝鲜的和平统一打开了新的局面，并为缓和远东的紧张局势作出了巨大贡献。
    崔勇进说，美帝国主义至今还强占着南朝鲜和台湾，并继续进行新的军事挑衅阴谋，它不顾世界人民的抗议和谴责，把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和原子战争基地，破坏和蹂躏停战协定。
    崔勇进上将强调说，美帝国主义者必须立即停止在南朝鲜和台湾的玩火行为，中国人民志愿军撤离朝鲜已经一年了，它再没有任何借口留在南朝鲜，它必须从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去。
    文章最后说，朝鲜人民将在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，尽一切努力来进一步加强朝中两国人民间传统的友谊团结。
    据新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜人民为庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年从10月1日开始举行的“朝中友好月”活动，二十多天来绚烂多彩地广泛展开。在中国人民志愿军入朝参战九周年和胜利归国一周年（10月25日）这个有意义的日子来临的时候，这个活动形成了新的高潮。
    连日以来，平壤各报都发表文章和诗歌，出版专刊，歌颂朝中友谊和志愿军在朝鲜的功勋。平壤的文学艺术界最近举行了中国文学晚会、中国美术晚会和朝中友谊晚会。朝鲜著名作家韩雪野和宋影、艺术家李冕相和郑宽彻、作曲家金京洙等都分别参加了友好月的活动。
    在这些晚会上人们介绍了中国文学艺术十年来的发展，和朝中两国的文化交流。
    从明天开始，朝鲜的音乐界还将举行为时一周的中国音乐周。作曲家金京洙和诗人姜立石最近作了一首“朝中友谊之歌”，他们热情地歌颂两国人民的友谊和共同跃进：“平壤的千里马蹄声震动了大地，北京的大跃进的光芒照耀着天空，歌唱吧！歌唱吧！歌唱朝中友谊，我们走在一条光荣的大路上多么幸福。”
    应邀到朝鲜访问的中朝友好协会代表团参加了朝鲜各地举行的“朝中友好月”活动，并且受到了热烈的欢迎。
    在这些日子里，同中国人民有深情厚谊的朝鲜劳动人民以各种形式来加强和发展同中国人民的友谊。去年周恩来总理访问朝鲜时曾经访问过的上阳农业社的社员们最近把自己的社命名为朝中友谊农业社。在中国人民的援助下兴建起来的新义州搪瓷工厂，工人们最近把产量提高到了建厂初期的四倍多，他们写信给当初来厂进行技术援助的上海工人，向他们祝贺节日并报告生产上的新成绩。（附图片）
