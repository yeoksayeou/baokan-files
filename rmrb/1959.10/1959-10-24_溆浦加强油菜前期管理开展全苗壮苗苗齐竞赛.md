    Changsha, October 23rd (This newspaper) -- After completing the rapeseed sowing task, Xupu County in Hunan Province is focusing on early-stage cultivation and management, launching a competition for full seedlings, strong seedlings, and even seedlings to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan for a rapeseed yield of 150 jin per mu.

    Having achieved rapeseed yields of 100 jin per mu for two consecutive years, Xupu County achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of an average of 130 jin per mu on the 48,000 mu of rapeseed harvested this year. Encouraged by the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the superiority of the people's commune has been brought into full play, and the county's task of sowing more than 130,000 mu of rapeseed was overfulfilled five days before "Cold Dew."

    After the rapeseed sowing acceptance, the Party committees at all levels firmly grasped the important link of early-stage cultivation and management, strengthened leadership, and established rapeseed production leading groups at all levels. More than 2,000 production teams in the county organized a rapeseed bumper harvest professional team of more than 20,000 people to contract responsibility by area, plot, and block. This ensured that each level had its focus and everyone engaged in experimentation. More than 60,000 mu of rapeseed bumper harvest fields have been identified throughout the county, and a system of overproduction rewards based on contracted work, contracted output, and contracted costs, as well as a production responsibility system of fixed people, fixed plots, fixed output, fixed work, and fixed quality have been established.

    Now, all localities are conducting comprehensive inspections, classifying and ranking the early growth of rapeseed, strengthening cultivation and management, comprehensively eliminating backward seedlings, and launching a competition to evaluate full seedlings, strong seedlings, and even seedlings.

    溆浦加强油菜前期管理开展全苗壮苗苗齐竞赛
    本报长沙23日电　湖南省溆浦县完成油菜播种任务以后，大抓前期培育管理，开展全苗、壮苗、齐苗竞赛，保证实现油菜亩产一百五十斤的跃进计划。
    连续两年获得油菜亩产百斤的溆浦县，今年全县实收的四万八千亩油菜，平均每亩获得一百三十斤的大面积丰产。在八届八中全会决议精神的鼓舞下，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，全县十三万多亩油菜播种任务，提前在“寒露”前五天超额完成。
    在油菜播种验收以后，各级党委紧紧抓住了前期培育管理的重要环节，加强领导，层层成立油菜生产领导小组。全县二千多个生产队组织了一支二万多人的油菜丰产专业队，分片分丘分块包干负责。做到了各级有重点，人人搞试验。全县已确定油菜丰产田面积六万多亩，建立了包工、包产、包成本超产奖励制度和定人、定丘、定产、定工、定质量的生产责任制。
    现在各地正在全面检查，对油菜前期生长情况分类排队，加强培育管理，全面消灭落后苗，展开全苗、壮苗、齐苗评比竞赛。（附图片）
