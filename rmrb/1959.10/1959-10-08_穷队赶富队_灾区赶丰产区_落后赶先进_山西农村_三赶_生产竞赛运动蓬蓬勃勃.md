The "Three Catch-Up" (i.e., poor catching up with rich, disaster areas catching up with bumper harvest areas, and backward catching up with advanced) production competition movement carried out in the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province is growing in scale and has achieved significant results. The development of this movement will push the countryside onto the road of common advancement, common harvest, and common prosperity.

In carrying out the "Three Catch-Up" movement, various localities focused on exceeding production and increasing income as the central content. However, due to different local conditions, the emphasis of the "Three Catch-Up" also varied. Communes, management areas, and production teams with lower grain yields, simple management, and less income focused on the poor catching up with the rich; areas severely affected by natural disasters focused on disaster areas catching up with bumper harvest areas; and grassroots units that have historically been slow in all aspects of work and have a backward production outlook mainly focused on launching mass movements to catch up with advanced units. In the competition movement, various localities have established a number of models of poverty turning into wealth, lean years turning into bumper years, and backwardness turning into advancement, as examples to encourage morale and strengthen confidence. In the competition movement, various localities have launched a vigorous opponent competition. The CPC Zuoyun County Committee, on the one hand, planted red flags in all communes throughout the county, establishing a total of twenty models in terms of farmland management, diversified operations, water conservancy construction, livestock development, and diligence and thrift in running communes, as well as political and ideological work, and mobilized from top to bottom, organizing various grassroots units to compare and check in light of local conditions. On the other hand, various grassroots units, based on their own shortcomings, mobilized commune members to pool their wisdom and efforts to determine the target of catching up and formulate specific action plans. Many management areas put forward the slogans of catching up with the advanced management area of Nanbali and catching up with the wealthy management area of Yanshanwu, specifically launching opponent competitions against these two management areas. These two management areas responded to the challenges of their brother management areas, in addition to formulating their own plans to become more advanced and more prosperous, the two advanced and wealthy management areas also launched an opponent competition of "competing for faster development and competing for more help to others." In carrying out the "Three Catch-Up" movement, the CPC Pingshun County Committee greatly utilized the positive factors of poor, disaster-stricken, and backward management areas and production teams, seized their "one red spot," praised them greatly, and boosted their morale, so that they could quickly leap from "one red spot" to "many red spots" and "overall red." As a result, not only did the movement develop vigorously, but all commune members felt happy.

The "Three Catch-Up" movement in rural Shanxi Province was launched under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. This spring, Jinbei area and parts of Jinzhong area successively proposed to carry out the movement of turning the poor into the rich and turning the backward into the advanced. In the summer, some areas suffered from drought and flood disasters, and the disaster areas launched a movement to increase production and increase income by compensating for dry land lost with irrigated land, compensating for reduced autumn harvest with late autumn harvest, compensating for grain lost with vegetables, and compensating for agriculture lost with sideline occupations, and put forward the slogan of "Small disasters should exceed production, and major disasters should guarantee production." Wujiapo Management Area of Chengguan Commune in Fushan County suffered a major drought for forty days. Commune members were not discouraged and actively expanded the irrigated area. After the rain, they rushed to replant more than 180 mu of autumn vegetables and increased the number of pigs raised by 4,000. The whole area launched a competition movement to turn a year of major disaster into a year of great harvest and catch up with disaster-free areas. In Pingshun County, management areas with an average per capita income of less than 40 yuan wanted to fight a big battle in September and October, and the average per capita income was required to increase to 60 yuan, and they launched a competition with nearby wealthy and advanced units based on this condition. Under the promotion of 41 management areas with a poor work base and low production level, all advanced and wealthy management areas in the county also took active action. On the one hand, they took the initiative to help their competition opponents catch up, and on the other hand, they tried every means to make themselves more advanced and wealthier.

Farmers in areas with less income, poorer work, and disaster-stricken areas in Shanxi Province, after establishing the ambition to "three catch-up," offering suggestions for "three catch-up," boosting their morale, and launching opponent competitions, the movement has achieved great results. In the Taihang Mountain area, Jin southeast area has made great progress in production in recent years, and the living standards of farmers have been continuously improved. However, due to the very unbalanced development of production, after communization, among the more than 4,000 management areas in the area, more than 1,600 management areas had a poor work base and low production and living standards. In the "Three Catch-Up" movement, the Party committees of various communes analyzed the reasons for backwardness and poverty, strengthened the leadership over these management areas, and the whole area transferred more than 2,000 cadres to work in backward and poor management areas, and at the same time organized advanced and wealthy management areas to help backward and poor management areas. Now, more than 800 poor and backward management areas have caught up with and approached the level of advanced and wealthy management areas. The grain output of these management areas this year is generally more than 30% higher than last year, and the income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery has also increased by about 50% compared with last year. Jinbei area, which has been known for its extensive farming and low yield in history, has seen a significant increase in grain yield during the Great Leap Forward last year. A number of communes that have turned disaster years into bumper years and caught up with the harvests of disaster-free areas have emerged in the disaster areas. Most of the poor, backward, and disaster-stricken communes, management areas, and production teams and the wealthy, advanced, and disaster-free communes, management areas, and production teams in the province have made common improvements after the opponent competition.

    穷队赶富队  灾区赶丰产区  落后赶先进
    山西农村“三赶”生产竞赛运动蓬蓬勃勃
    本报讯　山西省广大农村开展的“三赶”（即穷赶富、灾区赶丰产区、落后赶先进）生产竞赛运动，规模越来越大，并且已经取得了显著的成效。这一运动的开展，将把农村推向共同先进、共同丰收和共同富裕的道路。
    各地在开展“三赶”运动中，是以超产增收为中心内容，但由于各地的具体情况不同，“三赶”的重点也各有不同。粮食产量较低、经营单一、收入较少的公社、管理区和生产队以穷赶富为重点；遭受自然灾害损失严重的地区，以灾区赶丰收区为重点；历来各项工作进度缓慢、生产面貌落后的基层单位，主要以大搞群众运动赶先进单位为内容。在竞赛运动中，各地都树立了一批贫穷变富裕、歉年变丰年、落后变先进的标兵，作为鼓励斗志、坚定信心的榜样；在竞赛运动中，各地都开展了轰轰烈烈的对手赛。中共左云县委一方面在全县社社大插红旗，树立了农田管理、多种经营、水利建设、发展畜牧以及勤俭办社、政治思想工作等方面共二十个标兵，自上而下的层层发动，组织各基层单位联系当地情况进行对照、检查；一方面各基层单位根据自己的缺陷发动社员群策群力，确定追赶对象，制订具体行动计划。许多管理区提出赶先进管理区南八里，赶富裕管理区阎山吾的口号，指名向这两个管理区展开对手赛。这两个管理区响应兄弟管理区的挑战，除制订自己先进再先进、富裕更富裕的计划外，两个先进和富裕的管理区又相互展开了“比自己发展快、比帮助别人多”的对手赛。中共平顺县委在开展“三赶”运动中，大大发挥穷、受灾和落后管理区、生产队的积极因素，抓住他们之间的“一点红”，大表扬，鼓干劲，以便很快就从“一点红”跃进到“点点红”、“全面红”。这样做的结果，不仅运动开展的蓬蓬勃勃，而且社员个个心情舒畅。
    山西省农村“三赶”运动，是在党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的伟大号召下开展起来的。今年春季晋北地区和晋中部分地区曾先后提出开展穷变富、落后变先进的运动；夏季部分地区发生了旱涝灾害，受灾区又掀起了旱地丢了水地补、大秋减产晚秋补、粮食丢了蔬菜补、农业丢了副业补的增产增收运动，提出了“小灾要超产，大灾要保产”的口号。浮山县城关公社吴家坡管理区遭受了四十天大旱灾，社员们不灰心泄气，积极扩大灌溉面积，雨后突击补种了一百八十多亩秋菜，增养猪四千只，全区掀起了变大灾年为大丰收年的追赶无灾区的竞赛运动。平顺县平均每人收入四十元以下的管理区，要在9、10两个月大战一番，每人收入平均要求提高到六十元，以这个条件和附近富裕、先进单位展开了竞赛。在四十一个工作基础较差、生产水平低的管理区的促进下，全县所有先进、富裕管理区也积极行动起来，他们一方面主动帮助竞赛对手迎头赶上来，另一方面又多方设法使自己更加先进，更加富裕。
    山西省收入较少、工作较差和遭灾地区农民，经过大立“三赶”之志，大献“三赶”之策，大鼓干劲，大搞对手赛，使这个运动收到了很大成效。太行山区晋东南专区近几年来生产大发展，农民生活不断提高，但是由于生产发展很不平衡，公社化后，全区四千多个管理区，有一千六百多个管理区工作基础差、生产生活水平较低。在“三赶”运动中，各公社党委分析了落后、贫困的原因，加强了对这部分管理区的领导，全区共抽调了二千多名干部到落后、贫困管理区工作，同时组织先进、富裕管理区帮助落后、贫困的管理区，现在有八百多个贫困落后的管理区已经赶上和接近先进、富裕管理区的水平。这些管理区今年粮食产量一般比去年提高30％以上，林、牧、副、渔等多种经营的收入也比去年增加了50％左右。历史上耕作粗放以低产著称的晋北地区，去年大跃进中粮食产量有了显著的提高。在灾区已经出现了一批变灾年为丰年、赶上无灾区收成的公社。全省绝大部分穷困、落后、遭灾公社、管理区、生产队和富裕、先进、无灾区公社、管理区、生产队经过对手赛都有了共同提高。（杨义）（附图片）
