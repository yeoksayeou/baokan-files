In a large vat, the "Qingke barley wine," brewed by the farm association's deputy director, Jiga, and committee member, Dorje, was "hissing" and bubbling. These two girls, who were once Langsheng serfs, opened the vat, poured some wine into their palms to taste, and said with beaming smiles, "The barley wine is ready!" The joyful day that people had been waiting for a long time had finally arrived. This day marked the celebration of the victorious completion of the democratic reform by the farmers of Kaisong Township.

Early in the morning, the young women washed their hair and tied on red and green braids. The lively little Laji, looking her best, urged the young classmates to gather quickly. Now, no one could tell that this spirited thirteen-year-old girl had once worked as a "corvée laborer" and "slave" for two years.

In the large blue flower tent on the Norbulingka meadow, the national flag and Chairman Mao's portrait were hung up, and the farmers also brought the hydrangeas and oleanders from their homes to the venue. Behind the big tent was the kitchen tent, where several old men, who had volunteered to be chefs, were cutting radishes and mutton. Several large pots were set up under a big tree, where the entire township would have a feast today.

After everyone was seated, the farm association's deputy director, who came from a poor Chabpa background, spoke:

"We have achieved a great victory, and today we want to celebrate with all our hearts!" Everyone applauded enthusiastically. He continued, "Every year at this time, it is the Wangguo Festival (pre-harvest festival), but in previous Wangguo Festivals, looking at the bountiful crops, sadness and worry were intertwined, and many families ran out of food and fuel. Like today, being so happy in our hearts, everyone sitting here equally to hold a meeting, has never happened since ancient times…"

After several people spoke, everyone competed to present Hada scarves to Chairman Mao. Then, they started singing and dancing.

Light dance steps, melodious singing, swirling flower-patterned skirts, and joyous faces immersed people in happiness. Among the young men and women, Jiga led the singing. They sang:

For a thousand years slaves were emancipated.
We have the right to freedom,
We have the right to freedom,
Our hearts are filled with joy.

People sang and danced, taking turns eating and drinking barley wine. After "three rounds of wine," the enthusiastic "Guoxie" (circle dance) began. Two teams, men and women, formed a circle, and a young man in a green shirt, shaking a string of horse bells, started a duet.

The man sings:
Girls,
If you can sing, then sing!
Sing those songs that can touch our hearts.

The woman sings:
We have quite a few songs we can sing,
But to touch your hearts
I'm afraid we'll have to sing until late at night.

A burst of singing and dancing, then a sudden burst of rapid dancing. Old woman Cangjue brought a large jar and gave each sweaty singer a large bowl of barley wine, and then they sang again.

At this time, three old men over sixty years old—the former Tuipiong, Lao Lazhu, the forest ranger, Bazhu, and the poor Chabpa, Cunzhu—were drinking barley wine on the grass by the trees, discussing something. These three old men with bushy beards and deep-set eyes had suffered hardships since childhood and were always happy after their liberation. Lao Lazhu called his son (the farm association's deputy director), Awang, for "negotiations": "You are the chairman of the meeting, please allow us to dress up as 'Zhega' (those who say auspicious words) to offer congratulations!"

His son said seriously: "Now is the new era, put your old ways aside!"

The old men calmly reasoned: The three of us old men have lived the longest in the old society, suffered the most, and are especially happy today. We have the right to thank the Party and thank Chairman Mao. In the past, the "Zhega" did it to beg for food; we dress up as "Zhega" to offer congratulations and celebrate victory!

Finally, his son had to agree. So the three old men each took out a Hada scarf from their arms, parted the dancing crowd, and respectfully presented them to Chairman Mao's portrait. This was the second time they had presented Hada scarves. But as they turned around, got into position, and were about to act as "Zhega," the dancing girls pushed them aside. The three old men had to sit on the grass on the side and continue drinking barley wine.

The sun went down, and it started to rain, but the singing and dancing reached a climax. After many rounds of duets, the women always prevailed. When their singing stopped, the men couldn't come up with new songs and had to repeat what the women had sung, according to the rules.

The woman sings:
Oh, Eastern Night God!
A shining flagpole is erected on the high mountaintop;
Hardworking traveler!
I wish you a prosperous life after passing this mountain!
(The men repeat it once.)

The woman sings:
Oh, Eastern Night God!
Lush grass and trees are planted on the hillside;
Diligent shepherd!
I wish you let your cattle and sheep eat till they are round
and fat when you pass the hillside!
(The men repeat it again.)

The woman sings:
Oh, Eastern Night God!
Cool spring water is gathered at the foot of the mountain;
Foxes on the plain!
I wish you have many children and grandchildren after drinking this spring water!

No one expected that old Gesang, who used to be a little silly because he was tortured by the serf owners, had become lively and young again today. This fifty-year-old man wore new clothes and a new hat, danced, sang Tibetan opera, and acted as a clown to satirize the serf owners. Everyone laughed until their stomachs hurt. He said: I have never been so happy in my life. This old man had raised horses for the "Xidui" (manor manager) since he was fifteen, slept on top of the stable for thirty-five years, and didn't know how many beatings and scoldings he had suffered. Today, he has a house and land. When distributing livestock, the farm association cadres said: "The old man has raised horses for the lord for a lifetime and suffered a lifetime of hardship. Please choose the best horse and the best donkey!" How could such a change not restore the old man's youth!

In the middle of the night, while the Norbulingka was singing happily, someone started crying in the Zhuangzhai courtyard. It turned out that old mother Gaduo heard that the two girls from the work team, Xiaozhima and Xiaozhuoga, were leaving here tomorrow, and immediately told everyone. Adults and children all ran to look for the work team leader, old Chen, and asked these two staff members to stay. Little Laji, who was so happy in the morning, was now crying while holding the team leader's hand: "Zhima is leaving, who will teach us to sing?" As soon as she cried, the children cried, the adults cried, and old Chen asked the farm association cadres Jiga and Dorje to persuade them, but while they were persuading them, they cried themselves. Jiga said with tears in her eyes: "We have grievances to tell them, we have things in our hearts to tell them, and they taught us what we don't understand. Although the Communist Party cadres are all the same, new things are better, and old people are better!"

The singing was high in the Norbulingka, and there was crying in the courtyard. This unforgettable night! For thousands of years, who has cared about them? Who can help them stand up and care for them meticulously like the Communist Party?

It was not until the comrades of the work team explained to them clearly that two cadres had left, but there were still three left, and other cadres would come in the future, that people stopped crying. So, the farm association cadres invited the comrades of the work team to Jiga's house to offer them barley wine. The Norbulingka was singing, and the house was also singing, until dawn.

    林卡夜歌
    ——山南农村革命纪事
    林田　昂旺丁曾
    由农会副主任基嘉和委员多吉负责酿的“羌”、“青稞水酒”，在大瓮里“咝咝”冒着泡。这两个朗生出身的姑娘，打开瓮口，倒点酒在手心里尝一尝，眉开眼笑地说：“羌熟啦！”人们盼望好久的大喜日子终于来到了。这天，是凯松溪卡的农民们庆祝民主改革胜利完成的日子。
    一大早，年轻的妇女们就洗好了头，扎上了红绿辫穗儿。打扮得漂漂亮亮的小拉吉，来催小同学们快集合。现在谁也看不出来这个十三岁的活泼的小姑娘，曾经作了两年“差徭”、“奴隶”。
    林卡草地上的大蓝花帐篷里，国旗和毛主席像挂好了，农民们把家里的绣球花和夹竹桃也搬到了会场上。大帐篷后边，就是厨房帐篷，几个自报奋勇来当厨师的老头子，正在切萝卜和羊肉，一棵大树下面支起了几口大锅，今天全溪卡的人在这里会餐。
    人们都坐好以后，穷差巴出身的农会副主任说话了：
    “我们已经得到了很大的胜利，今天我们要尽情地欢乐庆祝！”大家热烈鼓掌。他接着说：“每年到这个时候，正是望果节（预庆丰收节），可是往年的望果节，看着丰收的庄稼，悲愁交织，许多人家断粮绝炊。像今天这样，心里这样高兴，大家平等地坐在这里开会，自古以来是没有的。……”
    几个人讲过话，大家都争着向毛主席献哈达。然后，就歌舞起来。
    轻快的舞步，婉转的歌声，旋转的花衣彩裙，喜盈盈的面孔，使人沉醉在欢乐里。在青年男女们中间，领唱的是基嘉，他们唱道：
    千年的奴隶解放了。
    我们有了自由的权利，
    有了自由的权利，
    心里无限欢喜。
    人们一面唱歌、跳舞，一面轮流吃饭、喝羌。“酒过三巡”，热烈的“郭谢”（圈舞）开始了。男女两队，围成一个圆圈，一个穿绿衫的小伙子抖着一串马铃，开始了对唱。
    男的唱：
    姑娘们，
    你们能唱就唱吧！
    唱那些能打动我们心的歌儿。
    女的唱：
    我们能唱的歌倒有不少，
    可是要打动你们的心
    怕要唱到深更半夜了。
    一阵高歌漫舞，又一阵急雨般的快跳。苍觉老婆婆背来一个大罐子，给汗流满面的歌手每人一大碗羌，于是他们又唱起来了。
    这时候，三个六十岁以上的老头子，过去的堆穷老拉珠，守林人巴珠，穷差巴村珠，在树丛边的草地上喝着羌，商量着一件事。这三位络腮胡子深眼窝的老人，都是从小受苦受难，翻身以后整天乐嗬嗬的。老拉珠把儿子（农会副主任）阿旺叫来“谈判”：“你是大会主席，请允许我们扮成‘者噶’（说吉祥话的）献祝词吧！”
    儿子严肃地说：“现在是新时代，把你们那老一套丢在一边去吧！”
    老人们不慌不忙讲道理：我们三个老头子在旧社会生活的时间最久，受的苦最多，今天也特别高兴，我们有权利感谢党，感谢毛主席。以前的“者噶”为了讨饭，我们扮“者噶”是献祝词，庆胜利呀！
    最后儿子只好答应了。于是三位老人每人从怀里掏出一条哈达，拨开跳舞的人群，恭恭敬敬献在毛主席像上。这是他们第二次献哈达。可是当他们回转身拿好架式，刚要扮“者噶”，跳舞的姑娘就把他们挤到一边去了。三个老人只好坐在一旁草地上继续喝羌。
    太阳落山了，下起了小雨，可是歌舞却达到了高潮。对唱了许多回合，妇女们总是占上峰。她们的歌声一落，男人们接不上新歌，只好按规矩重复妇女唱过的。
    女的唱：
    东方的夜神啊！
    在高高山顶上竖起了发光的旗杆；
    辛勤的行路人哪！
    祝你路过此山后生活富裕！
      （男人们重复一遍。）
    女的唱：
    东方的夜神啊！
    在山腰栽上了茂盛的草木；
    勤苦的牧人哪！
    祝你路过山腰时让牛羊吃得圆
      滚滚！
      （男人们又重复一遍。）
    女的唱：
    东方的夜神啊！
    在山根汇聚了清凉的泉水；
    平原上的狐狸呀！
    祝你喝了这泉水子孙满堂！
    谁也没想到，过去被农奴主折磨得有点傻里傻气的老格桑，今天变得又活泼又年青。这位五十岁的老人，穿戴了新衣新帽，跳了舞，又唱藏族戏，唱了戏，又耍活宝讽刺农奴主。惹得大家捧着肚子笑。他说：我有生以来，从没这样高兴过。这老人从十五岁给“溪堆”（庄园管理人）养马，三十五年来一直睡在马棚顶上，也不知挨了多少打骂。今天他有了房，有了地。分牲畜的时候，农会干部说：“老人家给领主养了一辈子马，受了一辈子罪，请挑一匹最好的马和一头最好的驴吧！”这样的变化，怎能使老人不恢复青春呢！
    半夜里，林卡里正欢唱的时候，庄宅大院里有人哭起来了。原来，噶多老妈妈听说工作组的两个姑娘小志玛和小卓噶明天要离开这里，就马上告诉了大家。大人、孩子都跑来找工作组长老陈，要求这两个工作人员留下。早晨还是那么高兴的小拉吉，这时拉着组长的手哭了：“志玛啦走了，谁教我们唱歌呢？”她一哭，孩子们都哭了，大人也哭了，老陈请农会干部基嘉和多吉来劝，可是劝着劝着，他们自己也哭了，基嘉落着泪说：“我们有苦向她们诉，我们心里有事向他们讲，我们不懂得的，他们教会了我们，虽说共产党的干部都一样，可是东西新的好，人是旧的好啊！”
    林卡里歌声高昂，院子里哭声一片，这难忘的夜啊！千百年来，有谁关心过他们。有谁能够像共产党这样帮助他们翻了身，无微不至地关心他们？
    直到工作组的同志向他们讲清，两个干部走了，还有三个留下，以后还会有其他干部来，人们才不哭了。于是，农会干部又把工作组同志邀到基嘉房子里，向他们敬羌。林卡里在唱，房子里也在唱，一直到天色将明。（附图片）
