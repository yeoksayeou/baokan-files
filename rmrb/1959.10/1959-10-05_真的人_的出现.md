Ode to the Decade

    The Appearance of "Real People"
    Hu Yuzhi
    When we sit in our offices, we probably don't truly see the enormous changes that have taken place in our motherland and among our people over the past decade. But once we arrive at the people's communes, at the factories and mines, as long as we are with the ordinary working people, we will feel that the world around us has been and is undergoing profound changes. The magnitude and depth of these changes sometimes far exceed our own imagination.

    In just ten short years, our steel production has increased seventy-five times, coal production has increased tenfold, and grain, cotton, and the like have increased several, dozens, or even hundreds of times. In addition, there is another kind of change that cannot be calculated in multiples or expressed as a percentage; however, it cannot be said that this change is not as great as the change in industrial and agricultural production, let alone that this change is unimportant. Here I am talking about the change in people, the change in relationships between people, the change in moral concepts, and, in general, the change in the spiritual outlook of society.

    During the nationwide steelmaking campaign last year, I was in Henan and Sichuan. In early spring this year, I was in Guangdong and Fujian, visiting many factories and people's communes. In the summer, I went to Gansu and Xinjiang in the Northwest. I saw the cliffs of the Three Gorges and the peaks of the Qinling Mountains, covered with small native furnaces and small blast furnaces. I saw countless oil wells springing up on the Gobi Desert, and I saw the diversion of the Tao River, a project that involved digging canals in high mountains. The high mountains were bowing their heads, the rivers were making way, the plains were covered with river networks, and the barren mountains were transformed into orchards. Nature is rapidly changing its face. The phenomena are indeed like this. But looking at the essence through the phenomena, the most profound change is still in people, not in nature.

    Let's not talk about the outstanding heroic figures like Huang Jiguang and Xiang Xiuli who have appeared and continue to appear every day in our country over the past decade. I just want to talk about ordinary people, ordinary workers, ordinary farmers, and ordinary young intellectuals who can be contacted anytime, anywhere.

    When we were visiting a people's commune in Henan, one of us saw a group of children panning for iron sand by a stream. He asked these children how many hours they worked each day and how much they earned. The children replied, "We are engaged in technical revolution and building socialism, not working for money." Our intellectual was put in his place and had to walk away with a red face.

    The slogan "Labor is sacred" was put forward even before the May Fourth Movement. But only after the proletariat seized state power, completed the Three Great Transformations, and changed the relations of production did people truly understand this resounding slogan. The Great Hall of the People, standing in front of Tiananmen Square, in addition to its grand scale, modern equipment, and high artistic level, was also built in large part by the communist voluntary labor of government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, school teachers and students, and citizens. On the construction sites of reservoirs, in the fields conducting deep plowing, and on the barren land at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, I saw countless workers, farmers, transferred cadres, and school teachers and students, working with such great enthusiasm and energy for the happiness of the motherland, for mankind, and for themselves and their future generations, I could not help but be moved to tears. Labor is no longer bought and sold as a commodity, but has become a glorious thing for every citizen. I believe that this is the most profound revolution that has taken place in our country in the past decade.

    Forty years ago, the author of "A Madman's Diary" could never have imagined such great changes. At that time, Lu Xun wrote with deep sorrow: "They themselves want to eat people, but they are afraid of being eaten by others, and they look at each other with extremely suspicious eyes... If this thought is gone, how comfortable it would be to work, walk, eat, and sleep with peace of mind. This is just a threshold, a turning point. But they are fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, wives, friends, teachers, students, enemies, and strangers, all forming a gang, encouraging each other, restraining each other, and refusing to take this step even to death."

    The revolution finally successfully broke through this threshold and passed this turning point. Four thousand years of "man-eating history" have been wiped out. On the railways, on buses, in hotels and guesthouses, even people who have never met treat you with warm and kind eyes. After liberation, especially after the Great Leap Forward, equal relations of mutual concern and care, cooperation, and working together have been established between leaders and the led, between cadres and the masses, between workers and peasants and intellectuals, between the elderly and the young, and between teachers and students. I visited a people's commune in Dongjiang. Before liberation, the two surnames in the township engaged in armed fights every year to compete for water channels, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Now, in one commune, they get along as well as close brothers and have forgotten the hatred of generations. In Yili, I visited the Yuqunweng People's Commune, which was organized by more than a dozen ethnic groups. Production is doing very well, and life has greatly improved. But before liberation, even communication and exchanges between ethnic groups were largely impossible.

    In the old society, the man-eating social system damaged the humanity of many people. Only in the new society, where "everyone is for the collective, and the collective is for everyone," have these people recovered their true humanity, not wanting to eat people and not being afraid of being eaten by others. Then, the "real people" that Lu Xun spoke of have appeared.

    It has only been ten years since liberation. Although the remnants of exploitation and the exploiting classes have not been completely eliminated, the victory of the revolution has already led to the emergence of "real people" in our country. This is the greatest victory among the countless victories we have achieved in the past decade. Let the poets sing praises. Let the artists sculpt vivid images. We should all cheer for the appearance of "real people"!

### “真的人”的出现

    “真的人”的出现
    胡愈之
    当我们坐在办公室里的时候，我们大概不会真切地看到祖国和人民这十年来发生的巨大变化的。但是一到了人民公社，到了工厂矿山，只要是和普通的劳动人民在一起的时候，我们就会感觉到我们周围的世界，已经并且正在起着十分深刻的变化。这种变化的巨大和深刻，有时远远超出了我们自己的想像。
    十年，仅仅是十年的短时间里，我们的钢产量增长了七十五倍，煤产量增长了十倍，粮食、棉花、诸如此类等等增长几倍、几十倍、甚至几百倍。另外还有一种变化，是不能用倍数来计算的，也无法用百分比来表达；但是，决不能说这种变化没有像工农业生产量的变化那样大，更不能说这种变化是无关重要的。在这里我说的是人的变化，人与人的关系的变化，道德观念的变化，总的说是社会精神面貌的变化。
    在去年全民大炼钢铁的时候，我在河南和四川。今年初春我在广东、福建，参观了许多工厂和人民公社。夏季我到了西北的甘肃和新疆。我看到三峡的悬崖和秦岭的高峰，上面密布着的小土炉和小高炉。我看到戈壁滩上涌现出的无数石油井，我看到在高山上开凿运河的引洮工程。高山在低头，河水在让路，平地满布着河网，荒山变成了果园，自然是在迅速改变着面貌。现象确是如此。但是通过现象看本质，起最深刻的变化的，仍然是人而不是自然。
    且不说这十年来在我国曾经出现并且还在每天出现像黄继光、向秀丽那样的杰出的英雄人物。我只想说一说普通的人，随时随地可以接触到的那些普通工人、普通农民以及普通青年知识分子。
    我们在河南参观人民公社的时候，我们之中的一个看到一群孩子们在溪边淘铁沙，他就问这些孩子们，每天做几小时工作，赚多少工资。孩子们回答：“我们在闹技术革命，搞社会主义，不是为赚钱啊。”我们那位知识分子被将了一军，只好涨红了脸走开了。
    “劳动神圣”这个口号是在五四运动以前已经提出了的。但是只有在无产阶级掌握了国家政权，完成了三大改造，改变了生产关系之后，人们对于这一响亮的口号才有了真正的认识，矗立在天安门前的人民大会堂，除了规模宏大、设备现代化和有高度艺术水平之外，更重要的是很大一部分工程是由机关干部、解放军官兵、学校师生和市民的共产主义义务劳动来建成的。在修建水库的工地上，在进行深耕的田野上，在祁连山下的荒地上，我看到了无数的工人农民、下放干部、学校师生，用那么大的热情和干劲，为祖国、为人类、为他们自己和世代子孙的幸福而进行劳动，我不禁热泪满眶。劳动不再作为商品买卖，而成为每一个公民的光荣的事情。我以为这是十年以来在我国进行的最深刻的革命。
    四十年以前，“狂人日记”的作者决想不到有这样大的变化。在当时鲁迅沉痛地写着：“自己想吃人，又怕被别人吃了，都用着疑心极深的眼光，面面相觑。……去了这心思，放心做事走路吃饭睡觉，何等舒服。这只是一条门槛，一个关头。他们可是父子兄弟夫妇朋友师生仇敌和各不相识的人，都结成一伙，互相劝勉，互相牵掣，死也不肯跨过这一步。”
    革命终于顺利地冲破了这一条门槛，通过了这一个关头。四千年的“吃人履历”，一笔勾消了。在铁路上，在公共汽车上，在旅馆和招待所里，即使是从不相识的人，也是用热情的亲切的眼光来看待你。解放以后，特别是大跃进以后，不论领导与被领导之间，干部与群众之间，工农与知识分子之间，老年人与青年人之间，师生之间，建立了平等的互相关怀、互相爱护的合作共事关系。我在东江参观了一个人民公社，解放以前，乡里的两姓的人，每年为争夺水渠，进行械斗，死伤了很多的人，现在在一个公社里，和亲兄弟一般地和好相交，把世代的仇恨都忘怀了。在伊犁我参观了愉群翁人民公社，那是由十多个民族组织起来的，生产搞得很好，生活大大改善了。但是在解放之前，各民族之间连交际往来都是不大可能的。
    在旧社会里，人吃人的社会制度，使许多人的人性都受到了损伤。只有到了新社会里，“每人为集体，集体为每人”，这些人才回复了真正的人性，不想吃人，也不怕被别人吃了，那么，鲁迅所谓的“真的人”便出现了。
    解放还只有十年，尽管剥削的残余和剥削阶级还没有被彻底消灭，但是革命的胜利，已经使我国出现了“真的人”。这是十年以来我们所取得的无数胜利之中最大的胜利。让诗人来歌颂吧。让艺术家来雕塑出生动的形象吧。我们都要为“真的人”的出现而欢呼！
