The people build a new country, already ten years past.
Summarizing the experiences, shedding the old constraints.
Three great mountains removed, a key move made first on the chessboard.
The system destroys exploitation, livelihoods still collective.
Loud thunder startles all to awaken, lightning chases away demons and fools.
The leadership makes excellent decisions, friends and comrades compete to wield the whip.
Acting decisively at the opportune moment, responding in harmony with the rhythm.
Whose power can resist the strength of the masses? With unified hearts, stone can be pierced.
Unwilling to be poor and blank, only desiring to be substantial and firm.
Flowers bloom everywhere in exuberance, soaring enthusiasm is transmitted.
Grain and cotton greatly increase production, coal and iron multiply in weight.
Consolidating the people's communes, seeing abundance in the markets.
Villages establish factories everywhere, daily learning from the immortals.
Chests are filled with clothing and food, alleys are filled with music and song.
A prosperous and peaceful scene is joyfully evident, boundless happiness.
The red sun rises in the east, dark clouds swirl on one side.
Surpassing England is expected to shorten, overtaking America is intended to extend.
All my friends are prosperous, good neighbors are closely connected.
Cheering for another great leap forward, good words linger together.
No need to heed slander, rushing straight ahead.

    祝贺建国十周年
    董必武
    人民建新国，已历十周年。
    总结诸经验，排除旧拘牵。
    山移三座去，棋下一盘先。
    制度摧剥削，营生尚集团。
    疾雷惊众醒，闪电逐魔颠。
    领导优决策，朋游竞执鞭。
    临机裁捷捷，应节响渊渊。
    群力谁能御，齐心石可穿。
    不甘穷与白，只愿实而坚。
    遍地开花闹，冲天干劲传。
    粮棉大增产，煤铁倍加权。
    巩固观公社，充盈见市廛。
    村村设工厂，日日学神仙。
    箱笥存衣食，闾阎杂管弦。
    太平欣有象，浩荡乐无边。
    红日东方出，乌云片面旋。
    超英期短缩，轻美意长延。
    我友皆兴盛，芳邻紧接联。
    欢呼再跃进，好语共流连。
    诽谤毋须顾，奔腾直向前。
