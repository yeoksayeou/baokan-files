Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia," in commenting on the work of the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote that this session is a special one because the Soviet Union submitted a solemn plan for complete and thorough disarmament for discussion at this session. "Izvestia" pointed out that before the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began to discuss this issue, a week of behind-the-scenes struggle had already unfolded.

"Izvestia" then wrote that the essence of the matter lies in the fact that those who dare not openly oppose the Soviet plan, as they have done many times before, are trying to obstruct the discussion of disarmament issues, or to confuse the Soviet proposal for complete disarmament with other insignificant proposals, or at least to delay it until the end of the session, at which time they can use the excuse of insufficient time to cancel the discussion of the Soviet disarmament proposal.

What tricks have the American diplomats and their partners not used in order to avoid immediately discussing the Soviet proposal! However, the American delegation and those who participated in its conspiracy had to retreat because most people agreed with the Soviet proposal to prioritize the discussion of the complete and thorough disarmament plan.

Referring to the General Affairs Committee of the United Nations General Assembly's illegal decision to include the so-called "Tibet issue" on the meeting agenda, "Izvestia" pointed out that just as many countries are beginning to discuss issues of concern to all mankind at the United Nations General Assembly with a positive attitude, someone is deliberately poisoning the atmosphere of the assembly.

The newspaper concluded by saying that the "people who poison the well" are not as sure of themselves in the United Nations now as they were in the past. But they are still trying to continue to use the United Nations as a bastion of the "Cold War."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 11th: The Romanian newspaper "Scinteia" published a commentary today strongly condemning the United Nations General Assembly for discussing the so-called "Tibet issue."

The commentary, entitled "An Action Against the Spirit of the Times," wrote that the UN General Affairs Committee, under the manipulation of the American voting machine, passed the decision to discuss the so-called "Tibet issue." This is an action against the great, peace-loving country, the People's Republic of China, and an action against the cause of easing international tensions and peace. The United Nations organization and world public opinion are once again faced with a serious trampling of the United Nations Charter.

The commentary pointed out that everyone knows that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Dealing with the situation in Tibet is entirely within the authority of the Chinese government. No one in the world has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. Putting this issue on the UN General Assembly agenda for discussion can only bring new and serious losses to the credibility of the United Nations.

The commentary said that it was Ireland and Malaya who raised the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations, but their commanders were the U.S. State Department. The clamor surrounding the "Tibet issue" has a more serious purpose, which is to attempt to legitimize the unrealistic and bankrupt policy towards the People's Republic of China, and to maintain and exacerbate the tense situation in Southeast Asia.

The commentary concluded by saying that any "Cold War" action rejected by the people of all countries will be resolutely opposed and condemned by all peace-loving people in the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 10th: The Albanian newspaper "Bashkimi" published a short commentary today entitled "A Plot to Poison the Atmosphere," condemning the United Nations General Assembly for discussing the so-called "Tibet issue."

The commentary said that the imperialists' raising of the so-called "Tibet issue" in the UN General Assembly is nothing more than a provocation and an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. However, this conspiracy has not and will not succeed in the past and in the future.

The commentary said that there are still a group of people in the United Nations who dream of continuing the "Cold War." They are plotting to launch a movement against the Chinese people, inciting hostility between the people of all countries, and plotting to undermine peace and poison the international atmosphere. This conspiracy does not help to establish mutual understanding between the people of all countries, but can only aggravate the political situation.

The commentary emphasized that Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs, and no one can interfere.

　　苏罗阿三国报纸揭穿美国强使联大讨论“西藏问题”的阴谋
    美国唯恐国际局势趋向缓和
    苏联“消息报”谴责美国千方百计阻挠讨论裁军问题
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：苏联“消息报”在评论联合国大会第十四届会议的工作时写道，这届会议是一次特殊的会议，因为苏联把庄严的全面和彻底裁军计划提交这次会议讨论。“消息报”指出，在联合国大会政治委员会开始讨论这个问题以前，已经展开了一个星期的幕后斗争。
    “消息报”接着写道，问题的实质在于：不敢公开反对苏联计划的人，像以前多次一样，企图阻挠讨论裁军问题，或者是把苏联的彻底裁军建议同其他意义不大的建议混为一谈，或者至少是拖到会议末尾，那时就可以借口时间不够而取消对苏联裁军建议的讨论。
    为了不立即讨论苏联建议，美国外交人员和他们的伙伴什么诡计没有用过啊！但是，美国代表团和参加它的阴谋的人不得不退却。因为大多数人都赞成苏联关于优先讨论全面彻底裁军计划的建议。
    在谈到联合国大会总务委员会非法决定将所谓“西藏问题”列入会议议程时，“消息报”指出，正当许多国家以良好的态度在联合国大会着手讨论全人类所关心的问题的时候，有人故意毒化大会气氛。
    报纸最后写道，“往井水里下毒药的人”现在在联合国的活动远不像过去那样有把握了。但是他们仍然企图继续利用联合国作为“冷战”的堡垒。
    新华社布加勒斯特11日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”今天发表了一篇评论，强烈谴责联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    这篇题为“一个违反时代精神的行动”的评论写道，联大总务委员会在美国投票机器操纵下通过了讨论所谓“西藏问题”的决定，这是反对伟大的、爱好和平的国家——中华人民共和国的行动，是反对缓和国际紧张局势与和平事业的行动。联合国组织和世界公众又一次面临着严重践踏联合国宪章的问题。
    评论指出，谁都知道，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分。处理西藏局势完全是中国政府权限以内的事。世界上任何人都无权干涉中华人民共和国的内部事务。把这个问题列入联大议程加以讨论，只能给联合国的威信带来新的严重损失。
    评论说，在联合国中提出所谓“西藏问题”的是爱尔兰和马来亚，但它们的指挥者却是美国国务院。围绕“西藏问题”的喧嚷有一个更为严重的目的，这就是企图把对中华人民共和国的不现实的和破产了的政策合法化，保持和加剧东南亚的紧张局势。
    评论最后说，为各国人民所唾弃的任何“冷战”行动，都将受到世界所有爱好和平人民的坚决反对和谴责。
    新华社地拉那10日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”今天以“毒化气氛的阴谋”为题发表短评，谴责联合国大会讨论所谓“西藏问题”。
    评论说，帝国主义者在联大提出所谓“西藏问题”，只不过是进行挑拨和企图干涉中国内政。但是，这种阴谋过去和将来都不会获得成功。
    评论说，在联合国中还有一批妄想继续进行“冷战”的人，他们阴谋掀起一个反对中国人民的运动，煽动各国人民之间的敌对情绪，阴谋破坏和平和毒化国际气氛。这种阴谋无助于建立各国人民之间的相互了解，只能使政治局势加剧。
    评论强调指出，西藏事务是中国的内政，任何人都不能干涉。
