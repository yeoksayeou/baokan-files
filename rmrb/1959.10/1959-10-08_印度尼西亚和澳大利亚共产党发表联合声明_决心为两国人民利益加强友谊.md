Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th - The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) issued a joint statement on the 6th by the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) and the Communist Party of Australia (CPA).

The statement said that the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Communist Party of Australia would like to draw the attention of their respective peoples to the danger of Japanese militarism which is currently being revived and rearmed with the help of US imperialism. The people of Indonesia and Australia affirmed their common determination to oppose and resist the danger of Japanese aggression.

The statement said that the Communist Party of Australia stated that the Australian working class opposed colonialism and in particular considered that the continued retention of West Irian as a colony by the Netherlands was a threat to peace in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. The Communist Party of Australia wholeheartedly supports the struggle to return West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia.

The statement said that the two sides also discussed the forthcoming visit and talks of Australian Prime Minister Menzies to Indonesia. Both sides believe that this opportunity should be used to strengthen peace and friendship. To this end, both sides agreed to ask their governments to study the possibility of concluding an Australia-Indonesia treaty of peace, friendship and non-aggression based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Such a treaty would guarantee mutually beneficial political attitudes between Indonesia and Australia and would allow other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region to participate in this treaty. It would be a contribution to peace in this region of the world.

The statement said that the two parties welcomed the great progress made in further consolidating the unity of the world communist movement in the past few years. The attempts of the Tito clique of modern revisionism to split and weaken the world communist movement have completely failed. The two sides assured each other that they would continue to wage a relentless struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. They are unanimously determined to strengthen their unbreakable friendship on the basis of proletarian internationalism for the benefit of the peoples of both countries. They will continue to contribute to consolidating the unity of the communist and workers' movement, and further strengthen the forces of world peace, striving for the final victory of peace and social progress. The joint statement also expressed a unanimous view on the current international situation.

This joint statement was issued after an exchange of views on a number of pressing international issues and issues of common concern to both parties in Indonesia between Maurice Hughes, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia. Maurice Hughes was invited to attend the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia and left Indonesia on September 27 to return to Australia.
