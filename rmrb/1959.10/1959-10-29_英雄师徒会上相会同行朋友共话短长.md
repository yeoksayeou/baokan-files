Inside and Outside the Gathering of Heroes

    At the National Industrial Exhibition, a crowd of visitors surrounded the model of the No. 10 Large Blast Furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel. A young man, after peering inside, exclaimed in surprise and ran to the side of the explainer, excitedly calling out, "Master Meng!" "Ah, you're here too!" The explainer turned around and grabbed the young man's hand.
    This young man was Liu Xueren, a young blast furnace foreman from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. When he was interning at Anshan Iron and Steel, he learned a lot of technology from this explainer, Meng Tai, a nationally renowned labor model. Today, old Meng Tai also came to visit, and coincidentally, when he reached the model of the No. 10 Large Blast Furnace, he was surrounded by people asking him questions. Meng Tai was so happy that he simply became a "volunteer explainer."
    The master and apprentice were overjoyed to see each other. Old Meng Tai patted the young man's shoulder and said, "Your production is good, and the utilization coefficient is very high. I still have to learn from you." Liu Xueren quickly said modestly, "We wouldn't dare say that. Anshan Iron and Steel will always be our elder brother." Old Meng Tai said seriously, "Hey! We should learn from whoever is good." When parting, old Meng Tai encouraged Liu Xueren, "Your conditions are good, you can completely catch up with Benxi, put in some effort!" Liu Xueren also sincerely replied, "I also want to find representatives from Benxi to exchange experiences."
    At noon, Liu Xueren's guests arrived. The guests were Wang Fuzhong, a blast furnace technician from Benxi, and Xie Minggui, the furnace foreman of the No. 9 Blast Furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, who were invited by old Meng Tai for him. Fellow practitioners meeting each other, deep feelings and long conversations. Liu Xueren asked Wang Fuzhong, "Our blast furnace tuyeres are damaged a lot, which seriously affects the increase in output. How did you solve it?" Wang Fuzhong immediately told him, "After we changed to inclined tuyeres, we have now eliminated the phenomenon of damaged tuyeres." Xie Minggui also chimed in, "We also used this method, which is both simple and reliable."
    When Liu Xueren saw off his guests, he had already decided to quickly report this experience to the factory Party committee. He said with confidence, "We will see the effect before the meeting is even over!"

    英雄师徒会上相会同行朋友共话短长
    在全国工业展览馆里，鞍钢十号大型高炉的模型跟前，围满参观的人。一个小伙子刚刚把头伸进去，就“嗬”了一声，往解说人的身边跑去，兴奋地叫着：“孟师傅！”“啊呀，你也来啦！”解说人回过头来一把抓住小伙子的手。
    这个小伙子是太原钢铁公司青年高炉炉长刘学仁，他在鞍钢实习的时候，就跟这位解说人、全国闻名的劳动模范孟泰，学习了不少技术。这天，老孟泰也是来参观的，可巧走到十号大型高炉模型跟前，就被人们团团围住问长问短。孟泰一高兴，就干脆当上了“义务解说员”。
    师徒俩相见，真是喜出望外。老孟泰拍着小伙子肩膀说：“你们生产情况不错，利用系数很高，我还要向你们学习哪。”刘学仁急忙谦虚地说：“可不敢那么说，到什么时候，鞍钢都是我们的老大哥。”老孟泰认真地说：“暧！谁好就向谁学习呗。”临分手的时候，老孟泰鼓励刘学仁：“你们条件好，完全可以赶上本溪，努把力吧！”刘学仁也诚恳地回答：“我还想找本溪代表交流交流经验。”
    到中午，刘学仁的客人来了。客人是老孟泰替他请来的本溪高炉技师王福忠和鞍钢九号高炉炉长谢明贵。同行见同行，情深话也长。刘学仁问王福忠：“我们高炉的风口坏得多，严重地影响了产量上升，你们是怎么解决的？”王福忠立即告诉他说：“我们改成斜风口后，现在已经消灭了坏风口的现象。”谢明贵也在一旁插言说：“我们也用了这种办法，既简便又保险。”
    刘学仁把客人送走的时候，心里已决定把这个经验迅速汇报给厂党委，他满怀信心地说：“不等开完会，就能见到效果！”
