　　　　　　The Brilliance of Taking Steel as the Key Link

　　The news has arrived: Our country's output of power generation equipment has fulfilled the original target for the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan—1962—three years and three months ahead of schedule.

　　The news of victory cannot help but bring to mind some past events. Before 1953, we did not have a decent factory for manufacturing power generation equipment, but this year, within nine months, we produced 1,454,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment.

　　In 1958, the Party put forward the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. Immediately, a situation of one horse taking the lead and ten thousand horses galloping forward appeared on the industrial front. Isn't our country's completion of the Five-Year Plan for power generation equipment more than three years ahead of schedule precisely the result of taking steel as the key link to drive everything else? However, the right-leaning opportunists cannot see the characteristics of this situation. They insist that taking steel as the key link has squeezed out everything else; that one horse took the lead, but the other horses did not follow. If these arguments were true, how would we understand the completion of the Five-Year Plan for power generation equipment more than three years ahead of schedule?

　　Industrial production is a series of closely interlinked processes. Large-scale steel production requires sufficient electricity, and power generation equipment needs to catch up. With power generation equipment, a source of power is provided for large-scale steel production; with steel, sufficient raw materials are provided for machinery manufacturing, enabling the manufacturing of more power generation equipment. This is the basis for the Party's formulation of the policy of taking steel as the key link for an all-round leap forward. Precisely because this policy correctly reflects objective reality, it will continue to shine with brilliant light.

    以钢为纲的光辉
    消息传来：我国发电设备的产量，提前三年零三个月完成了原定第二个五年计划最后一年——1962年的指标。
    胜利的消息，不由得令人想起了一些往事。在1953年以前，我们还没有一座像样的制造发电设备的工厂，而今年在九个月之内，就生产了一百四十五万四千瓩的发电设备。
    1958年，党提出了以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，工业战线上立即出现了一马当先，万马奔腾的飞跃形势，我国发电设备提前三年多完成了五年计划，难道不正是以钢为纲带动一切的结果吗？然而，右倾机会主义分子却看不到这个形势的特点，他们硬说以钢为纲是挤掉了一切；一马当先，其他的马并没有跟上来。如果这些论调是事实的话，发电设备提前三年多完成五年计划又作何理解呢？
    工业生产是一环一环紧紧相扣的。大办钢铁需要足够的电力，需要发电设备赶上去；有了发电设备，为大办钢铁提供了动力来源；有了钢铁，又为机械制造提供了充足的原料、材料，制造更多的发电设备。这是党制订以钢为纲全面跃进方针的依据。正由于这个方针是正确地反映了客观实际的，因此，它将继续闪耀着灿烂的光辉。
