Comrade, after looking at this rough statistical table at the end of the article, what are your thoughts? Perhaps you will ask: Just how low was the purchasing power of the peasants in Jilunzhai Village, Guoyang County, Anhui Province before Liberation? If we were to do a real statistic, we would only get a blank paper. From the following short stories, you will find the real answer.

A Riddle

One day in the autumn of 1947, a peasant named Manzi from the village went south of the village to collect manure and inadvertently picked up a thermos. The thermos was dropped by a remnant of the Kuomintang bandits who were fleeing in panic under the tight pursuit of our army. At that time, Manzi and the masses of the whole village did not know what it was. Manzi secretly took the thermos home, locked the door and broke the glass liner of the thermos. With great regret, he took the empty shell out to show everyone. The whole village was in an uproar, saying, "Manzi broke some kind of treasure." The young people did not believe in evil. Hearing that it was dropped by the Kuomintang army, they believed that it was an ominous thing - a bomb, or some poisonous thing. Therefore, they all sweated for Manzi: It exploded, and he was not killed!

This riddle was not solved until after Liberation. Before Liberation, almost all the daily necessities in the city were not available to the peasants. Not to mention the thermos, even a piece of foreign cloth was very rare.

A Gown Worn by More Than Thirty Grooms

There used to be a custom here that the groom had to wear a foreign cloth gown on the day he visited his father-in-law after the wedding. In this particularly poor Jilunzhai, a foreign cloth gown was simply a "priceless treasure." Except for landlords and rich peasants, even middle peasants rarely had one made. Therefore, at that time, the young people of Jilunzhai racked their brains to borrow a foreign cloth gown when they got married. Ji Baochu's father had to bite the bullet and wear a coarse cloth gown to see his father-in-law after his marriage. When Ji Mingxin's father got married, he went to the neighboring village to borrow one from Jia Zongyao, a middle peasant. This half-old, not-new foreign cloth gown of Jia Zongyao was borrowed by more than thirty grooms. At that time, it was even more difficult for a poor family's daughter to wear a foreign cloth dress when she got married. Not to mention Jilunzhai, the situation in the neighboring villages was similar. The foreign cloth jacket that Zhang Wangshi from Zhang Village wore when she got married was her mother's dowry. She wore it for a few days and then hid it to leave it for her daughter to wear when she got married. One piece of clothing was worn by three generations of grandmothers and granddaughters for sixty years.

All of this has become a historical trace. In the ten years since Liberation, the masses of Jilunzhai, while actively depositing savings (now with savings of 2,200 yuan), have added their favorite daily necessities according to their needs. There are 105 thermos bottles in 84 households in the village, and as for foreign cloth clothes, every household has them and everyone wears them, and it is difficult to count them one by one. I heard that Ji Baochu got married this spring, so I went to visit him. He said with a smile: "The dawn of my marriage is different from that of my father." He sewed a new set of clothes for himself, sewed seven clothes for his bride, and also bought two pieces of lining for the clothes, cotton clothes, lined clothes, and single clothes, all the clothes for the four seasons are complete. The red cotton pants that the bride wore were still corduroy.

Little Yun is Ten Years Old

Ten years after the founding of the country, Xiao Yun has also grown healthily for ten years. Seeing her so innocent and lively, who would have thought that her life was picked up from the wilderness?

Xiao Yun's family used to be as poor as water. Her grandmother led her father to escape famine and beg for food all year round. The whole family of six had only one tattered cotton quilt; her father was also captured by the Kuomintang and served as a soldier for two years. The family's life was still very hard in the early days of Liberation. At this time, Xiao Yun was born. Her parents could not see the good times ahead at that time, and only felt that there was another mouth to feed, and the days ahead were not easy. Thinking of the past when they escaped famine, they saw people selling their daughters, and they couldn't help but feel a chill in their hearts. So they hardened their hearts, with tears in their eyes, and threw the newly born Xiao Yun into the wilderness south of the village overnight.

Fortunately, the cadres from the county who came to carry out production and disaster relief discovered her early and rescued her from a pile of flies and brought her home. The village farmers' association also took out clothes, white flour and money, and Xiao Yun was able to stay in the world.

Xiao Yun grew up year by year, and the family's life became better day by day. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the whole family's life has become even better. The five members of the family have three good cotton quilts, in addition to foreign cloth clothes, there are also sanitary clothes, sweaters, rubber shoes, sneakers and two pens; savings of more than 20 yuan; the family also raises two pigs, one sheep, nine chickens and ducks. The commune implements eating without money, and often distributes fruits to eat.

Xiao Yun came back from herding sheep and ate fruit and affectionately called out "Dad." Her father, Ji Baozhang, the commune's breeder, was filled with emotion. He often touched his eight-year-old son's head and said to people: If it weren't for the Communist Party, not to mention Xiao Yun, even this child would not be able to live!

### 水瓶、大褂及其他

　　水瓶、大褂及其他
　　云飞扬
    同志，看了文末这张粗略的统计表，你有什么感想呢？也许你要问：解放前安徽省涡阳县纪伦寨村农民的购买力，究竟低到怎样的程度？如果真要统计，那只有交白卷。从下面几个小故事里，你会找到真正的答案。
    谜
    1947年秋后的一天，村上一个名叫蛮子的农民，到村南拾粪无意中拣到了一个热水瓶。水瓶是一支国民党残匪，在我军紧紧追击下，仓惶逃窜时丢掉的。当时，蛮子以及全村群众，都不晓得它是个啥东西。蛮子暗暗地把水瓶带回家，关起门来把水瓶胆弄坏了，怀着十分惋惜的心情，拿个空壳出来叫大家看，全村人都轰动起来，说“蛮子把个什么宝贝弄坏了”。青年人不信邪，听说是国民党军队丢掉的，认定它是个不祥之物——炸弹，或是什么有毒的家伙，因此都为蛮子捏把汗：把它弄炸了，还没被炸死！
    这个谜，一直到解放以后才揭开，解放前城市里几乎所有的生活用品，都没有农民的份，水瓶就不说了，甚至连块洋布头都很稀罕。
    一件大褂穿了三十多个新郎
    这里过去有个风俗，新郎婚后拜岳丈的那一天，要穿洋布大褂。在这个特别穷困的纪伦寨，洋布大褂简直是个“无价宝”，除了地主、富农，连中农也难得制一件，因此那时纪伦寨的青年人结婚时，为借洋布大褂伤透了脑筋。纪保初父亲婚后，只好硬着头皮，穿件粗布大褂去见老丈人。纪明新父亲结婚时，特意跑到邻村，向中农贾宗耀去借，贾宗耀这件半旧不新的洋布大褂，一共借给了三十多个新郎穿过。那时候，穷人家的闺女出嫁，想穿件洋布的衣裳，更是难上难，纪伦寨甭说了，邻村的光景也差不多。张庄张王氏结婚时穿的件洋布褂，是她母亲的嫁妆，她穿了几天又藏起来留给女儿出嫁时穿，一件衣服婆孙三代穿了六十年。
    这一切都成为历史的陈迹了。解放十年来，纪伦寨群众，在积极存款储蓄的同时（现在存款达两千二百元），根据需要添置自己心爱的生活日用品。全村八十四户就有一百零五个水瓶，至于洋布衣服已是家家有，人人穿，很难一一统计出来。听说纪保初是今年春天结婚的，我去访问他。他笑着说：“俺和爹爹结婚时的晨光不同了。”他自己缝了一身新，给新娘缝了七件衣服，还扯了两件衣裳里子，棉衣、夹衣、单衣，四季衣服俱全。新娘穿的那条红棉裤，还是灯芯绒的呢。
    小云十岁
    建国十年，小云也健康地成长十个年头了。看她那样天真活泼，谁想到她这条命，还是从荒地里拾来的呢？
    小云的家过去贫如水洗，奶奶成年累月地领着爹在外逃荒要饭，全家六口人只有一床破棉絮；爹还被国民党抓去当了两年兵。解放初期全家生活还是很苦。这时小云出世了，爹娘当时看不清未来的好光景，只觉又多了一张嘴，眼前日子不好熬，想起过去逃荒在外，见到人家卖女的事，心中不寒而栗，于是心一横，噙着眼泪，连夜把刚生下来的小云，丢到村南的荒地里。
    幸亏当时县里下来搞生产救灾的干部发现的早，把她从一堆苍蝇里救回家。村农会又拿出衣服、白面和钱，小云才算留在人世上。
    小云一岁一岁地长大了，家里的日子一天好似一天，自从办起人民公社后，全家生活更美好了。五口人就有三床好棉被，除了洋布的衣服不算，还有卫生衣、毛衣、胶鞋、球鞋和两支钢笔；存款二十多元；家里还养了两头猪、一只羊、九只鸡和鸭。公社实行吃饭不要钱，还常常分到水果吃。
    小云放羊回来，吃着水果亲切地叫声“爹”，她爹——公社饲养员纪保章，无限感慨，常常摸着八岁小儿子的头，对人说：要不是共产党，甭说小云啦，连这孩子也是活不成的啊！
