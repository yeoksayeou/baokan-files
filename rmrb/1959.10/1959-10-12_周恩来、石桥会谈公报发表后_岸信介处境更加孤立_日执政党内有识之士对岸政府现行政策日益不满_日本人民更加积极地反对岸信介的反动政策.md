Xinhua News Agency report: A commentary by our reporter: The Nobusuke Kishi group, which implements policies of subservience to the United States and hostility towards China, is not only increasingly opposed by the Japanese people, but also incurs the dissatisfaction of informed people within the Liberal Democratic Party. Nobusuke Kishi's situation today is more isolated than ever.

Since the visit to China by former Japanese Prime Minister, Tanzan Ishibashi, one of the leaders of the "anti-mainstream faction" of the Liberal Democratic Party, and the publication of the communiqué of the Zhou Enlai-Tanzan Ishibashi talks, the dividing line between the policy stances of the Kishi Nobusuke group's "mainstream faction" and some factions within the powerless "anti-mainstream faction" has become apparent. Ishibashi's reply to reporters on September 26 was a sign of this.

At this press conference, Ishibashi affirmed: China is a peace-loving country, and the hostile policy adopted towards China should be thoroughly reconsidered. He said: In order to achieve friendly relations between Japan and China, it is necessary to change Japan's relationship with the United States. In this sense, there is no need to rush to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He pointed out that if the revised "Security Treaty" is signed hastily this year, thereby making Japan heavily reliant on the United States in terms of "security relations," it will have adverse consequences for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

Ishibashi told Japanese reporters that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. He wants to work to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. Ishibashi also said: Politics and economics are inseparable, which is natural. Hostile policies and trade are contradictory. He pointed out that unless the communiqué of his talks with Premier Zhou Enlai is implemented, it will be impossible to promote Sino-Japanese friendly relations.

According to reports, when Ishibashi met with Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on September 30, he had already explained the main content of his remarks to reporters to Nobusuke Kishi and requested Nobusuke Kishi to change his policies. However, Nobusuke Kishi then stated that he could not change the policies he had consistently implemented. It is clear from this that this meeting once again exposed that Nobusuke Kishi is running counter to the wishes of the Japanese people, and he himself reaffirmed that he does not belong to the ranks of "informed people."

Informed people from the Kono faction and Matsumura-Miki faction, etc., of the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party, have expressed their support for Ishibashi's visit to China and the Zhou Enlai-Tanzan Ishibashi talks communiqué, and expressed their dissatisfaction with the current policies of the Nobusuke Kishi group. According to the "Japan News Weekly," a certain member of the Diet belonging to the Matsumura-Miki faction said: "The iceberg of the Cold War has begun to melt, and it is only a matter of time before the United States changes its world policies. I am against revising the Security Treaty." He said: Due to the fluctuations caused by the successive visits to China by Ishibashi and Kenzo Matsumura, the argument for shelving the revision of the "Security Treaty" may become the main trend within the Liberal Democratic Party. A certain member of the Diet belonging to the Kono faction said: "I personally agree with the Zhou Enlai-Tanzan Ishibashi talks communiqué. Now (Liberal Democratic Party) members are half-facing Nobusuke Kishi and half-turned away from Nobusuke Kishi. Perhaps Nobusuke Kishi only sees the half of the face facing him, and feels satisfied that the party is unified!"

The increasingly obvious political differences within the Liberal Democratic Party have greatly alarmed the Nobusuke Kishi group. They hurriedly used various means to try to obliterate the impact of the policy proposals put forward by Tanzan Ishibashi, and hurriedly wooed Ichiro Kono, plotting to disintegrate the united trend of the "anti-mainstream faction." However, things went against their wishes. On September 29, the "anti-mainstream factions" of the Liberal Democratic Party, including Ishibashi, Kono, Matsumura-Miki, Ohno, and Ishii, formed the "Kinseikai" to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi group. They expressed their dissatisfaction with the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the Nobusuke Kishi group's monopolization of important positions within the party and the government. Their dissatisfaction actually contained a demand for Nobusuke Kishi to step down. It is worth noting that members of the "Sanno Club," who are dissatisfied with Nobusuke Kishi within the Nobusuke Kishi faction, also participated in the "Kinseikai," which cannot but be seen as a phenomenon of widespread desertion for Nobusuke Kishi.

Things are still developing. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," on the 7th, Ichiro Kono and Kenzo Matsumura expressed their dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's current policies at a Liberal Democratic Party leaders' meeting hosted by Tanzan Ishibashi, and criticized the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's practice of slandering Khrushchev's proposal for complete disarmament through statements by the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Ishibashi, Kono, and Matsumura reached a consensus on issues such as welcoming the proposal for complete disarmament. The meeting also heard Tanzan Ishibashi's report on his visit to China. These three leaders of the "anti-mainstream faction" clearly stated their policy positions at this meeting, which was undoubtedly a blow to the Nobusuke Kishi group, which was blowing cold air in international relations to create public opinion for its revision of the "Security Treaty."

Encouraged by the Zhou Enlai-Tanzan Ishibashi talks communiqué, the Japanese people are more actively opposing the Nobusuke Kishi group's traitorous policies. A patriotic and democratic united front against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has united Japanese workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth to fight against the Nobusuke Kishi group. Now this mass movement is developing in depth from cities to rural areas, and its scale exceeds the momentum when the Japanese people successfully stopped the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet from revising the "Police Duties Execution Law" last year. This situation will inevitably provide favorable conditions for informed people within the Liberal Democratic Party to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi group's perverse actions, and will inevitably put the Nobusuke Kishi group in an embarrassing situation of being attacked from both inside and outside.

### 周恩来、石桥会谈公报发表后  岸信介处境更加孤立  日执政党内有识之士对岸政府现行政策日益不满　日本人民更加积极地反对岸信介的反动政策

　　周恩来、石桥会谈公报发表后
    岸信介处境更加孤立
    日执政党内有识之士对岸政府现行政策日益不满　日本人民更加积极地反对岸信介的反动政策
    新华社讯　本社记者述评：执行屈从美国和敌视中国政策的岸信介集团，不仅日益遭到日本人民的强烈反对，同时也招致自由民主党内有识之士的不满，岸信介今天的处境比以往更加孤立了。
    自从日本前任首相，自由民主党“反主流派”领袖之一的石桥湛山访华和周恩来、石桥湛山会谈公报发表以后，岸信介集团的“主流派”和不当权的“反主流派”中的一些派系之间的政策主张分界线，开始明显。石桥回国后在9月26日的答记者问，就是一个标志。
    石桥在这次记者招待会上肯定地说：中国是爱好和平的国家，对中国采取的敌视政策应当全盘加以重新考虑。他说：为了日中的友好关系，有必要改变日本同美国的关系，在这个意义上，没有必要急于修改日美“安全条约”。他指出，如果匆忙地在今年内签署修改后的“安全条约”，从而使日本在“安全关系”上紧紧依靠美国，那么这对中日关系的正常化是会产生不良后果的。
    石桥向日本记者表示，台湾问题是中国的内政问题。他要为打开日中关系的僵局而努力。石桥还说：政治和经济不可分割，这是很自然的。敌视政策和贸易是互相矛盾的。他指出，除非实现他和周恩来总理的会谈公报，否则无法增进中日友好关系。
    据报道，石桥在9月30日同岸信介首相会谈时，已经把他向记者发表谈话的主要内容向岸信介说明，并且要求岸信介改变政策。但是岸信介当时表示不能改变他一贯执行的政策。由此可见，这次会谈实际上再一次暴露了岸信介是和日本人民的愿望背道而驰，他自己再次肯定他不属于“有识之士”的行列。
    自由民主党内“反主流派”的河野派和松村—三木派等有识之士，都表示支持石桥的中国之行和周恩来、石桥湛山会谈公报，对岸信介集团的现行政策表示不满。据“日本新闻周报”报道，属于松村—三木派的某议员说：“冷战的冰山开始融化，美国改变世界政策已经是个时间问题。我反对修改安全条约”。他说：由于石桥和松村谦三的相继访问中国而引起的波动，主张把修改“安全条约”问题搁置起来的论调在自由民主党内可能成为主要趋势。属于河野派的某议员说：“我个人是赞成周恩来、石桥湛山会谈公报的。现在（自由民主党）党员是半个脸朝着岸信介，半个脸背着岸信介。也许岸信介只看到朝向自己的那半个脸，认为党内统一而感到满意呢！”
    自由民主党内的政见分歧日益明显，使岸信介集团大为惊慌。他们急忙使用各种手段企图抹煞石桥湛山提出的政策主张的影响，并且赶紧拉拢河野一郎，阴谋瓦解“反主流派”的联合趋势。然而，事与愿违。包括石桥、河野、松村—三木、大野、石井等自由民主党的“反主流派”各派，在9月29日结成了反对岸信介集团的“锦水会”。他们对修改“安全条约”和岸信介集团独占党内和政府的要职表示不满。他们的不满意见实际上含有主张岸信介下台的要求。值得注意的是，参加“锦水会”的还有岸信介派中对岸信介心怀不满的“山王会”的成员，这对岸信介来说不能不是一种众叛亲离的现象。
    事情还在发展。据“朝日新闻”报道，7日，河野一郎和松村谦三在石桥湛山主持的自由民主党首脑座谈会上，对岸信介的现行政策表示不满，并且指责了岸信介内阁用官房长官谈话方式诬蔑赫鲁晓夫的全面裁军建议的作法。石桥、河野、松村在欢迎全面裁军建议等问题上取得了一致意见。会上还听取了石桥湛山的访华报告。这三个“反主流派”的领袖在这次座谈会上明确地谈出他们的政策主张，这无疑是对在国际关系中大吹冷空气为其修改“安全条约”制造舆论根据的岸信介集团的一个打击。
    在周恩来、石桥湛山会谈公报的鼓舞下，日本人民更加积极地反对岸信介集团的卖国政策。一个反对修改日美“安全条约”的爱国民主统一战线，已经把日本的工人、农民、知识分子、妇女、青年团结起来向岸信介集团进行斗争。现在这个群众性的运动正在从城市向农村纵深地发展，它的规模超过了去年日本人民成功地阻止住岸信介内阁修改“警察官职务执行法”时的声势。这种形势必将为自由民主党内有识之士提供反对岸信介集团倒行逆施的有利条件，必将使岸信介集团面临内外夹攻的狼狈局面。
