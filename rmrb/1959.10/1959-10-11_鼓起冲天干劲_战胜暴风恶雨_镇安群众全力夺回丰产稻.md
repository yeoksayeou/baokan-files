Summoning Soaring Enthusiasm: Overcoming Storms and Torrential Rains
　　Zhen'an Masses Strive to Reclaim Bumper Rice Harvests

　　(Our dispatch) The people of Zhen'an County, residing in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi Province, with their iron will, overcame various natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and pests, and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice. Over 18,000 mu of early rice in the county have been harvested and threshed, with an average yield of 701 jin per mu, an increase of 49% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958. Among them, 456 mu exceeded 1,000 jin. The high-yield experimental plot of 1.01 mu of rice cultivated by the youth planting group of the Jinshui Team in the Fengzhen Commune averaged 2,018.8 jin per mu. The late rice, currently being harvested, is expected to yield no less than the early rice.

　　Just as the farmers here began harvesting, the sixteen communes throughout the county encountered the largest storms, torrential rains, and hailstorms in recent years. Many rice paddies were filled with water; some rice plants were flattened and shedding grains, with severe cases losing 30% to 40%. “We must not let disasters take away the fruits of our harvest.” On September 14th, the county mobilized over 50,000 laborers to engage in drainage and emergency harvesting. Comrade Shen Jingnian, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Shizhen Commune, led more than 1,500 cadres and members, working hard for three days and three nights, to dig and wash out 6,880 jin of rice and retrieve more than 1,200 corn cobs from the mud. Comrade Zhang Chenghuai, Vice Chairman of Tiechang Commune, led five cadres deep into the Lianghe Management Area, mobilizing 2,275 commune members to retrieve over 1,000 jin of rice in three days by digging, sweeping, and washing. In the struggle against storms and torrential rains, the people's communes once again demonstrated their tremendous power. Those not affected by the disaster fully supported the affected areas. The Sanlian Production Team of the Jiezhi Management Area of Yungaig Commune sent more than 1,500 members at a time to support the Taiping Team, which was affected by the disaster, and harvested more than 12,000 jin of rice in one and a half days, recovering 90% of the fallen ears. In the urgent harvesting, where every second counted, all communes paid close attention to careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain was stored in the granary. Members of the Lianhe Production Team of the Jiezhi Management Area proposed to thresh more times and shake three more times, and added a mat around the threshing barrel to avoid scattering rice. The Fengzhen Commune organized more than 300 auxiliary laborers to retrieve 1,400 jin of rice ears and fallen grains from the harvested land. The Miaogou Management Area of the Miaogou Commune organized members to re-thresh the 200 mu of harvested rice straw and harvested more than 600 jin of grain.

　　The bumper harvest of early rice greatly encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses. Now, the people of the county are actively engaged in the late autumn overproduction campaign, constantly topdressing and weeding, determined to overproduce again and again.

　　In addition, leadership cadres at all levels in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi, have gone deep into the fields, fully mobilizing the masses, and applying the experience of this year's summer harvest to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, striving to harvest an extra ten jin of grain and pick an extra ten jin of cotton flowers per mu of autumn fields.

　　According to recent statistics, more than 10,000 autumn gleaners from only six communes including Gaoling, Yongle, Chengguan, Fangli, Jingyang and Shiqiao have gleaned more than 42,800 jin of corn and 44,000 jin of seed cotton from the harvested fields and roadsides. The quality of harvesting has also greatly improved compared to the past. For example, after a general inspection at the beginning of the autumn harvest in the Xiguan Production Team of Chengguan Commune, it was found that an average of more than six jin of grain was being lost per mu. Now, the result of the inspection is that only a little more than one jin is lost per mu, and most of this one jin of grain has also been picked up by the autumn gleaning team.

　　鼓起冲天干劲　战胜暴风恶雨
    镇安群众全力夺回丰产稻
    本报讯　住在陕西秦岭山区的镇安县人民，以钢铁般的意志，战胜了旱、涝、风、雹、病虫等各种自然灾害，夺得了早稻全面大丰收。全县一万八千多亩早稻已收打结束，平均亩产七百零一斤，比大丰收的1958年增产49％，其中有四百五十六亩超过千斤。凤镇公社金水队青年种植小组一亩零一分水稻高额丰产试验田平均亩产二千零一十八斤八两。正在收割的晚稻，产量也不低于早稻。
    正当这里农民开镰收割的时候，全县十六个公社，遇到了几年来最大的暴风暴雨和冰雹灾害。不少稻田里积满了水；有些水稻倒伏落粒，严重的落粒达30％到40％。“决不能让丰收果实叫灾害夺走”。9月14日，全县就出动了五万多名劳动大军，投入排水抢收运动。石镇公社党委副书记申景年同志，带领干部、社员一千五百多人，苦战三天三夜，在泥水中挖洗出稻谷六千八百八十斤，拣回包谷棒子一千二百多斤。铁厂公社副社长张承怀同志带领了五名干部深入两河管理区，动员二千二百七十五名社员，用挖、扫、洗等办法，在三天内拣回稻谷一千多斤。在与暴风雨作斗争中，人民公社又一次显示了巨大威力，没受灾的全力支援受灾区。云盖公社结子管区三联等生产队，一次就去了一千五百多名社员，支援受灾的太平队，一天半抢收回水稻一万二千多斤，90％的落穗被夺了回来。在十万火急与天争粮的抢收中，各公社都十分注意了细收细打，颗粒归仓。结子管理区联合生产队社员提出，多打一下，多抖三下，并在拌桶四周加围席，避免了稻谷抛撒。凤镇公社组织了三百多名辅助劳力，在收割过的地里拣回稻谷穗和落粒一千四百斤。庙沟公社庙沟管理区组织社员把打过的二百多亩稻草重打了一遍，多收了六百多斤谷子。
    早稻大丰收，大大鼓舞了广大人民的冲天干劲。现在全县人民又积极投入了晚秋超产运动，不断追肥、锄草，决心超产再超产。
    又讯　陕西三原县各级领导干部深入田间，充分发动群众，运用今年夏收的经验，做到细收细打，力争每亩秋田多收十斤粮，棉田多摘十斤花。
    据最近统计，全县仅高陵、永乐、城关、方里、泾阳、石桥等六个公社的一万多名拾秋队员光从收过的地里和路边，就拾回了玉米四万二千八百多斤，籽棉四万四千多斤。收割质量也比过去大大提高。例如城关公社西关生产队开始收秋时经过普遍检查，平均每亩要丢失六斤以上的粮食，现在检查的结果是每亩只丢一斤多，而这一斤多粮食也大部分被拾秋队拾回来。
