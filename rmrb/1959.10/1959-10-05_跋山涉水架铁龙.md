Building Iron Dragons Over Mountains and Rivers
By Our Correspondent Gao Qingqi

The Lanqing Railway is open to traffic in Xining! As a witness to the construction process of this line, how can I not be filled with passion for the great achievements created by the railway construction heroes who once fought in the mountains and rivers of Sichuan and Shaanxi? It is they who, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, filled in the dotted line on the map at the fastest speed; it is they who, together with the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, overcame numerous difficulties and wrote many moving chapters in the history of China's railway construction.

Fighting the Yellow River

The first gateway of the Lanqing Railway to Qinghai is the Yellow River Bridge, nine kilometers away from the Hekou Station of the Lanxin Railway. Whether the Yellow River Bridge could be erected in time was the key to opening the line to Xining ahead of schedule. As soon as the bridge started construction in June last year, it encountered the flood season. The construction site of the Yellow River Bridge is located at the confluence of the Yellow River and the Huangshui River, where the water flow is rapid and there are many difficulties in construction. At that time, some people believed that construction could not be carried out during the flood season, because there had been no such precedent for many years. However, the vast number of employees demanded that this gate be knocked open at the fastest speed.

Make the Yellow River give way! The Party organization of the Second Engineering Department of the Xining Railway Bureau, which was in charge of the construction of this bridge, was determined to lead the vast number of employees to wage a tenacious struggle against the flood.

After the start of construction, it was continuously attacked by more than ten rare flood peaks in decades. Wooden cages weighing dozens of tons were washed away after being submerged, one difficulty after another. However, no amount of difficulty could stop these heroic people. After figuring out the flood patterns, the engineers and workers of the First Bridge Engineering Team jointly developed the construction method of "encircling with caissons to build islands, steel sheet pile cofferdams plus wooden cage protection" and advancing from both peaks to the middle, first building shallow water piers and then building deep water piers, cleverly avoiding the Yellow River flood peak.

When building the last pier – Pier No. 5 – the caisson had to sink through a layer of large cobblestones seven or eight meters thick in the riverbed. When it was about to reach the rock layer, the turbulent river water poured into the caisson. The workers turned on all thirteen pumps they had, but they could not drain the water in the caisson. Using soil bags and cotton to fill the gaps could not resist the pressure of the thirteen-meter deep water outside the caisson. Finally, after research by engineers and workers, the method of grouting in the water outside the caisson was adopted to subdue the flood and quickly sink the caisson to the rock layer.

Pier No. 5 was built out of the water in May this year. The Yellow River Bridge, 240 meters long with seven piers and eight spans, was completed in only ten months, three months ahead of schedule.

The Hearts of All Ethnic Groups

In order to make the Lanqing Railway reach Xining as soon as possible, in the winter of last year, tens of thousands of people from people's communes, troops, government offices, and schools rushed to the railway line to set up camps; among them were young men and women of all ethnic groups, including Hui, Tu, Tibetan, and Han. Under the guidance of railway workers, they ran from one hill to another, opening mountains and chiseling rocks, transporting soil and ramming. In the entire winter, the civilian workers completed more than three million cubic meters of earth and stone work.

At the Xining Hub Station, a large number of cadres, teachers and students, and soldiers from Qinghai Province pulled small wooden carts and rushed to the construction site against the harsh northwest wind. They used iron picks to break the frozen soil and level the roadbed of the station. Everywhere were joyful crowds of laborers.

The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai have been looking forward to the railway for more than just a day! Today, many people have contributed their own strength to this road to happiness.

Marching Quickly into Xining

Crossing bridges and mountains, the track-laying and bridge-building machine is advancing rapidly towards Xining. How many eyes of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai are watching the railway construction heroes!

On the morning of September 16, the bridge-building detachment arrived at the last bridge on the Huangshui River – the Huangshui No. 8 Bridge, which is twenty-eight kilometers away from Xining. The Party organization of the detachment headquarters handed over the plan to open the line to Xining ahead of schedule on October 1 to the workers for discussion. Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the forty-odd bridge-building workers unanimously guaranteed to realize the plan ahead of schedule on September 25.

Regardless of the cold autumn wind, the workers were busy day and night. After the beam-stabilizing team had completed the preparatory work at the bridgehead, they immediately ran from the bridgehead to the shore under the leadership of team leader Wu Dexin to help the beam-binding team bind the beams. Every process was closely linked. It took only three hours and seventeen minutes to erect the second span, creating an amazing record. Finally, the Huangshui No. 8 Bridge was erected ahead of schedule, and the track-laying project on the Hekou-Xining section of the Lanqing Railway was successfully completed on September 22, and the train drove into Xining ahead of schedule!

    跋山涉水架铁龙
    本报记者　高庆琪
    兰青铁路通车西宁了。作为这条线路建设过程的一个目睹者，对于曾经转战巴山蜀水之间的筑路英雄们创造的这一重大成就怎能不满腹激情？是他们，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，用最快的速度添补起了地图上的这条虚线；是他们，和青海各族人民一起，战胜了重重困难，在我国铁路建设史上写下了许多动人的篇章。
    搏战黄河
    兰青铁路通向青海的第一座门户，就是距离兰新铁路河口车站九公里的黄河大桥。能不能及时架起黄河大桥，是能否提前通车西宁的关键。去年6月份大桥一动工，碰上了洪水期。黄河大桥施工点正处在黄河和湟水的汇合点，水流湍急，施工中有许多困难。当时有人认为，在洪水期不能施工，理由是多少年来没有过这种先例。而广大职工却要求用最快的速度敲开这座大门。
    要黄河让路！指挥这座大桥施工的西宁铁路局第二工程处党组织下定决心，领导广大职工同洪水展开了顽强的搏斗。
    开工以后，连续遭到了十余次数十年来少有的洪峰的袭击。几十吨重的木笼下沉以后就被冲走了，一个困难接着一个困难。但是，天大的困难也阻挡不住英雄的人们。第一桥梁工程队的工程师和工人在摸清洪水规律以后，共同研究出“围囹筑岛钢板桩围堰加木笼防护”和从两峰向中间推进、先修浅水墩后修深水墩的施工方法，巧妙地避过了黄河洪峰。
    在修筑最后的一座桥墩——五号桥墩的时候，沉井下沉时要穿过七、八米厚的河床大孤石层。快到达岩层的时候，汹涌的河水向沉井里涌进。工人们把仅有的十三部抽水机都开动了，也抽不干沉井里的水。用土袋、棉花填堵，也抵抗不住沉井外十三米深的水的压力。最后经过工程师和工人研究，采取了在沉井外水中灌浆法，才制服了洪水，使沉井迅速下到岩层。
    五号桥墩筑出水面是在今年5月份。全长二百四十米的七墩八孔黄河大桥，仅仅用了十个月的时间就全部建成，比原计划提前三个月完工。
    各族人民的心
    为了使兰青铁路早日修到西宁，在去年冬季，人民公社、部队、机关、学校有数以万计的人群赶赴铁路沿线，安营下寨；其中有回、土、藏、汉等各族青年男女。他们在铁路工人指导下，从一个山头奔向另一个山头，开山凿石，运土打夯。在整个冬季，民工们共完成了三百多万土石方工程。
    在西宁枢纽站，青海省的广大干部、学校师生、部队官兵拉着小木车，顶着凛冽的西北风涌向工地。他们用铁镐敲破冻土，垫平车站的路基，到处是欢快的劳动的人群。
    青海各族人民盼望铁路已经不是一天了！今天，许多人都为这条幸福之路付出了自己的一份力量。
    快步进西宁
    越过一座座桥梁，跨过一重重山峦，铺轨架桥机迅速向西宁挺进。青海省各族人民多少只眼睛在注视着筑路英雄们！
    9月16日上午，架桥分队到达了湟水上的最后一座大桥——湟水八号大桥，距离西宁还有二十八公里。队部党组织把提前在10月1日通车西宁的计划交给工人讨论，四十几个架桥工人在党的八届八中全会号召的鼓舞下，一致保证在9月25日提前实现计划。
    顾不得秋夜的寒风，工人们日夜忙碌着。稳梁组做好桥头准备工作以后，紧接着就在组长吴德新带领下，从桥头跑到岸上，帮助捆梁组捆绑桥梁。个个工序衔接得十分严密。架设第二孔梁只用了三小时十七分钟，创造了惊人的纪录。最后，湟水八号大桥比原计划提前架完，兰青铁路河口、西宁段的铺轨工程在9月22日胜利结束，火车提前开进了西宁！
