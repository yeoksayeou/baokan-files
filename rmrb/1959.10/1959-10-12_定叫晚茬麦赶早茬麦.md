The CCP Xiao County Committee in Anhui Province, while ensuring the proper planting of early and mid-season wheat fields, is strengthening leadership in the preparatory work for late-sown wheat fields to eliminate low yields and achieve balanced production increases.

This year, Xiao County plans to plant 1.3 million mu of wheat, an increase of 300,000 mu over last year. Because the county has been rushing to plant many late-autumn crops this year, 60% of the wheat will be sown on late-sown fields. According to past experience, late-sown wheat planting, due to being squeezed into the late autumn planting season with concentrated agricultural work and tight schedules, often results in rough cultivation and insufficient fertilizer application. Coupled with untimely sowing and extensive management, this leads to a high proportion of Class III seedlings, resulting in low yields. After analyzing the above situation, the County Committee put forward the slogan "Late-sown catch up with early-sown, late wheat surpass early wheat, resolutely eliminate Class III seedlings," requiring all parts of the county to take effective measures to ensure the proper planting of late-sown fields while doing a good job in the planting of early and mid-season wheat fields:

(1) Arrange stubble in advance and implement it in the fields. Arrangements should be made according to the principles of early stubble, good soil quality, which is both conducive to wheat planting this year and does not delay the great autumn harvest next year. Huangzang and Xinzhuang People's Communes have adopted the method of inserting signs into the fields to arrange late-sown wheat fields, and have formulated sowing procedures according to the stubble, soil quality, and other conditions. Liutao, Dulou, and other communes have registered all stubble, and adopted the method of looking at the previous stubble, arranging the current stubble, and determining the next stubble to achieve comprehensive planning from the previous season to the next season, and from this year to next year.

(2) Grasp the late autumn to promote fast ripening, early stubble clearing, and early sowing. Huangkou Commune has adopted the method of processing and fertilizing late-autumn crops that are prepared for wheat planting to promote early ripening, making the late autumn stubble clear half a month earlier than in previous years, greatly advancing the late wheat sowing time.

(3) Arrange the sowing period according to the characteristics of the variety. For example, varieties such as Nanda 2419, Chunyu Pi, and barley, which are relatively strong spring varieties, are generally arranged in late-sown fields.

(4) Ensure that late-sown wheat has more abundant fertilizer than early and mid-season wheat. Many production teams in Jiudian Commune are carrying out the "Late Wheat Fertilizer Surpasses Early Wheat" campaign to ensure that each mu of late wheat is fertilized with more than 300 dan. In addition, all regions are also required to reserve enough late wheat seeds, and to achieve deep plowing and thorough harrowing to overcome the past habit of being rougher the later it gets. Teams with strong labor and livestock resources and teams with more early stubble and more late stubble in Huangkou Commune have signed mutual support contracts.

(5) Strengthen leadership. For communes and teams with large wheat planting tasks, shortage of labor and livestock, and concentrated late stubble, the County Committee has decided to send special personnel to strengthen leadership. Various communes have also taken the same measures to strengthen leadership over production teams to effectively ensure the proper planting of late-sown wheat.

### 定叫晚茬麦赶早茬麦

　　定叫晚茬麦赶早茬麦
    中共安徽萧县县委在保证种好早中茬麦田的同时，加强晚茬麦田播种准备工作的领导，消灭低产，达到平衡增产。
    萧县今年计划种麦一百三十万亩，比去年扩大了三十万亩。由于全县今年抢种的晚秋作物很多，有60％的小麦要播种在晚茬田上。根据过去经验，晚茬麦播种由于挤在秋种后期，农活集中，时间紧迫，往往耕作粗糙，肥料施得很少，加上播种不适时和管理粗放，所以出现三类苗最多，造成低产。县委分析了以上情况，提出了“晚茬赶早茬，晚麦超早麦，坚决消灭三类苗”的口号，要求全县各地采取有效措施，在作好早中茬麦田播种工作同时，切实作好晚茬田播种工作：
    （一）提前安排茬口，落实到田，根据茬口早、土质好，既有利今年种麦又不误明年大秋的原则进行安排。皇藏、新庄等人民公社采取插标到田的办法，安排了晚茬麦田，并按茬口、土质等情况定出播种的规程。刘套、杜娄等公社对所有茬口进行登记，采取看上茬、安排本茬、确定下茬的办法，作到上季看下季，今年看明年，全面规划。
    （二）抓晚秋，促快熟，早腾茬，早播种。黄口公社对准备种麦的晚秋作物，采取加工加肥促使早熟的办法，使晚秋比往年提早半个月腾出茬口，大大提早了晚麦播种时间。
    （三）根据品种特性安排播种期。如南大2419、春玉皮及大麦等是春性较强的品种，一般安排在晚茬田里。
    （四）保证晚茬麦比早中茬有更充足的肥料。九店公社不少生产队正在开展“晚麦肥料超早麦”运动，保证晚麦每亩施肥三百担以上。此外，各地还要求留足晚麦种，做到耕深耙透，克服过去愈晚愈粗糙的习惯。黄口公社劳、畜力强的队和劳、畜力弱的队，早茬多和晚茬多的队已签订了互相支援的合同。
    （五）加强领导。对种麦任务大，劳力畜力缺少和晚茬集中的社、队，县委决定派专人去加强领导。各个公社也采取同样办法加强对生产队的领导，切实保证种好晚茬麦。
