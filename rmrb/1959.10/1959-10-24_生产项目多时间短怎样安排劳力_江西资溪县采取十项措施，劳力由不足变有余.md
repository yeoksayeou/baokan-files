How to Arrange Labor When There Are Many Production Projects and Little Time
Zixi County, Jiangxi Province, Takes Ten Measures, Turning Labor Shortage into Surplus

Nanchang, October 23rd (Reported by this newspaper) The Zixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangxi Province, believes that although there are many winter production tasks, short time, and many projects, after comprehensive arrangements, the county's labor force can be transformed from a shortage to a surplus.

Zixi County's winter production includes more than ten items such as winter planting, winter plowing, water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and sideline occupations. The total task is one to two times more than last year. Due to the expansion of the late rice planting area, all efforts must be devoted to autumn harvesting in October, leaving only November and December for winter production, which is twenty days less than in previous years.

Zixi County is a small mountainous county. According to calculations, there is still a shortage of 220,000 workdays this winter, equivalent to 3,900 full-time laborers. The Zixi County Committee, following the principle of "ensuring key tasks and taking care of general tasks," uses 15% of the total labor force with agricultural production technology to engage in winter plowing, winter planting, and field management of winter crops; 25% of the total labor force to repair water conservancy; 25% of the total labor force to accumulate fertilizer; and 30% of the total labor force to engage in forestry and sideline production. The remaining 600 laborers are assigned to transportation, forestry and sideline processing, and collective welfare undertakings.

Based on past experience in solving labor problems, the Zixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward ten measures to solve the shortage of winter labor: First, actively reform tools to solve the most difficult transportation problems in mountainous areas. This alone can save 50,000 workdays for the entire county. Second, continue to carry out the "Three Thousand Model Workers" and "One Thousand Ingenious Sisters" high-efficiency movement. Third, run collective welfare undertakings well so that 9,000 female laborers can achieve full attendance. Fourth, mutually adjust labor resources under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. Fifth, implement the production responsibility system and strengthen labor management. Sixth, in the accumulation and manufacturing of fertilizers, promote the use of local materials and on-site accumulation and manufacturing. This can save more than 20,000 workdays. Seventh, complete the grain delivery task ahead of schedule in October, which can increase 50,000 workdays for the entire county. Eighth, combine the reclamation and repair of oil tea mountains with fertilizer accumulation, combine winter crop field management with pest control, and combine water conservancy construction with fertilizer accumulation. Ninth, organize more than 2,000 cadres and staff members from the county to support the communes in water conservancy construction. Tenth, rationally divide groups, rationally allocate tasks, and rationally mobilize labor to prevent idling.

After Zixi County comprehensively arranged winter labor, cadres and commune members felt confident and clear about the direction, which further enhanced their confidence in completing winter production tasks.

    生产项目多时间短怎样安排劳力
    江西资溪县采取十项措施，劳力由不足变有余
    本报南昌23日电　中共江西省资溪县委根据冬季各项生产任务大，时间短，项目多，但经过全面安排，全县劳力可以由缺变有余。
    资溪县冬季生产包括冬种、冬翻、修水利、积肥、造林、副业等十多项，总的任务比去年增加一倍至两倍。由于扩大了晚稻面积，10月份要全力搞秋收，只有11月、12月搞冬季生产，时间上比往年少了二十天。
    资溪县是个山区小县，根据计算，今冬尚缺少二十二万个劳动日，折合三千九百个整劳动力。资溪县委依照“保证重点，照顾一般”的原则，以占劳力总数15％具有农业生产技术的劳力，搞冬翻、冬种和冬季作物田间管理；以占劳力总数25％的人修水利；以占劳力总数25％的人积肥造肥；以占劳力总数的30％的人搞林业、副业生产。其余的六百个劳动力分别安排在运输、林副加工等生产战线上和集体福利事业中。
    中共资溪县委根据过去解决劳力问题的经验，提出了十项解决冬季劳力不足的措施：一、积极改革工具，解决山区最困难的运输问题。仅此一项全县就可节约五万个劳动日。二、继续开展“三千名标兵手”、“一千名巧姐妹”的高工效运动。三、办好集体福利事业，使九千名妇女劳动力达到出全勤。四、在互助互利的原则下互相调剂劳动力。五、实行生产责任制，加强劳动管理。六、在积造肥料中，推行就地取材、就地积造。这样可节省二万多个劳动日。七、提前在10月份完成送粮任务，全县可以增加五万个劳动日。八、做到垦修油茶山与积肥相结合、冬季作物田间管理与灭虫相结合、兴修水利与积肥相结合。九、组织全县二千多名干部、职工支援公社兴修水利。十、合理划分小组、合理分配任务、合理调动劳力，防止窝工。
    资溪县全面安排冬季劳力之后，干部和社员感到心中有数，方向明确，更加增强了完成冬季生产任务的信心。
