Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 13th. The First Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Solovyov, recently spoke to our reporter about the current tasks of the socialist labor competition vigorously unfolding in the Soviet Union and the work of the Soviet trade unions.

Solovyov said that the socialist labor competition in the Soviet Union has now entered a new period of upsurge, with tens of thousands of workers involved in various forms and contents of socialist labor competition. Up to now, 180,000 work teams across the country are striving for the glorious title of "Communist Labor Team." Several thousand work teams have already won the title of "Communist Labor Team." The Gaganova movement, with the content of "advanced helping the backward," has also expanded from mutual assistance between individual workers to mutual assistance between entire workshops, entire work sections, and entire enterprises and regions. Millions of workers are involved in this movement.

Solovyov said that the current socialist labor competition in the Soviet Union has a variety of forms: the "Communist Labor Team" movement, the "Advanced Helping the Backward" movement, the "Communist Construction Shock Worker" movement, the "Accumulate Seven-Year Plan Fund" movement, and the "Invention and Rationalization Proposal" movement. They have only one purpose, which is to strive to complete the annual plan and the seven-year plan ahead of schedule and above the quota. The main content of the competition is to increase labor productivity, promote new technologies, accelerate the mechanization and automation of the production process, improve product quality, and reduce product costs.

Solovyov said that after the reorganization of the management form of industry and construction in the Soviet Union, that is, after the establishment of national economic committees in various regions, there have been some changes in the form and content of the leadership of socialist competition. That is to say, the leadership of the competition is more specific, in-depth, and timely than before.

He said that the scope of the competition has also expanded. In the past, socialist labor competition was only carried out among workers, but now it has expanded to all personnel participating in production, especially technical personnel and designers.

He said that leading cadres of trade unions have gone deep into the competition to conduct practical leadership. Due to the strengthening of the leadership and organization of socialist labor competition, the socialist labor competition throughout the Soviet Union is now developing in an increasingly expanded, in-depth, and effective direction.

Solovyov said: The central task of the Soviet trade unions at present is: to use all forces and create all conditions to carry out socialist labor competition, that is to say, to attract all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of every factory, enterprise, construction site, and state farm into the labor competition to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule; to care about the tasks of the competitors and supervise their actions; to summarize the competition experience in a timely manner; and to help backward workers and production units to improve to the advanced level.

　　为提前完成年度计划和七年计划而奋斗
    苏联职工掀起劳动竞赛新高潮
    据新华社莫斯科13日电　全苏工会中央理事会书记处第一书记索洛维耶夫最近对本社记者谈到了正在苏联蓬勃展开的社会主义劳动竞赛和苏联工会工作的当前任务。
    索洛维耶夫说，目前，苏联的社会主义劳动竞赛已经进入了一个新的高涨的时期，成千成万的劳动者卷入了各种形式与各种内容的社会主义劳动竞赛。截至目前为止，全国已有十八万个工作队在为争取“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号而努力。有几千个工作队已经获得了“共产主义劳动队”的称号。以“先进帮助落后”为内容的加干诺娃运动，也由个别工人间的互助，扩大到全车间、全工段和整个企业和整个地区间的互助。卷入这一运动的劳动者也有成百万人。
    索洛维耶夫说，目前，苏联社会主义劳动竞赛有着多种多样的形式：“共产主义劳动队”运动、“先进帮助落后”的运动、“共产主义建设突击手”运动、“积累七年计划基金”运动、“创造发明和合理化建议”运动。它们的目的只有一个，这就是为提前和超额完成年度计划和七年计划而奋斗。竞赛的主要内容是提高劳动生产率，推广新技术，加速生产过程的机械化和自动化，提高产品质量和降低产品成本。
    索洛维耶夫说，苏联工会在工业与建筑业管理形式改组后，也就是说在各个地区成立国民经济委员会后，对社会主义竞赛领导的形式和内容，也有了某些改变，这就是说，对竞赛的领导是较以前更具体、更深入和更及时了。
    他说，竞赛的范围也扩大了，过去社会主义劳动竞赛只在工人中间进行，而现在扩大到一切参加生产的人员之间，特别是技术人员与设计人员之间。
    他说，工会的领导干部都深入到竞赛中去，对竞赛进行实际的领导。由于对社会主义劳动竞赛领导和组织工作的加强，全苏联的社会主义劳动竞赛，现在正向着越来越扩大、深入和有效的方向发展。
    索洛维耶夫说：苏联工会目前的中心任务是：要利用一切力量和创造一切条件来开展社会主义劳动竞赛，也就是说要把每一个工厂、企业、建筑工地、国营农场的一切工人、工程师、技术人员、职员吸引到为提前完成七年计划的劳动竞赛中来；关心竞赛者的任务，监督竞赛者的行动；及时地总结竞赛经验；帮助落后的工人和生产单位提高到先进的水平。（附图片）
