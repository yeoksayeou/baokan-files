    Vigorously Develop Farmland Water Conservancy and Grassland Water Conservancy
    Qinghai Will Mobilize 25% of its Labor Force This Winter and Next Spring to Build Water Conservancy Projects

    (Our Newspaper, Xining, 9th) The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires Party committees at all levels to grasp agricultural, animal husbandry, and sideline production while rapidly launching a massive upsurge in farmland water conservancy and grassland water conservancy construction.

    Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said at the Qinghai Provincial Water Conservancy Telephone Conference that from October this year to January next year, the province should mobilize 25% of its labor force to invest in water conservancy construction, implement the principle of "small-scale projects as the main focus, water storage as the main task, and commune management as the main method," and build farmland water conservancy for 1.2 million mu, completing more than 70% of the annual water conservancy plan. At the same time, it is also necessary to build grassland water conservancy for 2.25 million mu and carry out soil and water conservation work on 3,000 square kilometers of land.

    Currently, Huangzhong County has decided to basically complete the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and grain and oil procurement tasks by October 10, complete the finishing work before the 15th, and from the 15th, transfer a large number of laborers to the water conservancy front lines. Xining City, which has completed the grain procurement task, has decided to organize a labor army of 20,000 to 25,000 people in the next few days to immediately invest in the large-scale water conservancy movement. The reclamation system has decided to organize more than 80,000 people to build water conservancy projects.

    The telephone conference believes that to effectively carry out the water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, and greatly boost morale; adhere to the general line of socialist construction, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes; and use the various successful experiences of last year's large-scale water conservancy projects to widely and deeply carry out a socialist labor emulation movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. In order to do a good job in water conservancy construction, the Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to effectively arrange the lives of the masses.

    大兴农田水利和草原水利
    青海今冬明春将动员25％的劳力兴修水利
    本报西宁9日电　中共青海省委要求各级党委在抓紧农牧副业生产的同时，迅速掀起一个声势浩大的兴修农田水利和草原水利高潮。
    省委第一书记高峰同志在青海省的水利电话会议上说，从今年10月开始到明年1月的四个月中，全省要动员25％的劳动力投入水利建设运动，贯彻执行“小型为主，蓄水为主，社办为主”的方针，兴修农田水利一百二十万亩，完成本水利年度计划的70％以上；同时还要兴修草原水利二百二十五万亩，在三千平方公里的土地上搞水土保持工作。
    目前，湟中县已决定在10月10日基本完成秋收、秋翻、粮油征购任务，15日以前进行扫尾工作，从15日起，抽调大批劳动力开赴水利前线。已经完成粮食征购任务的西宁市，决定在最近几天内组织二万到二万五千人的劳动大军，立即投入大兴水利运动。农垦系统决定组织八万多人兴修水利工程。
    电话会议认为，要切实搞好今冬明春的兴修水利运动，各级党委必须加强领导，坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会精神，继续反对右倾，大鼓干劲；坚持社会主义建设总路线，充分发挥人民公社的优越性；运用去年大搞水利的各种成功经验，广泛深入地开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。为搞好兴修水利的工作，省委还要求各地必须切实安排好群众生活。
