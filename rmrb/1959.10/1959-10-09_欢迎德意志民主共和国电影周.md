    Welcome to the German Democratic Republic Film Week
    Huang Gang
    The German Democratic Republic Film Week, held in ten major cities in our country to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, opens today. We express our warm welcome. Over the past ten years, more than thirty excellent art films and dozens of combative documentaries from the German Democratic Republic have been shown to our people, with a total audience of more than 70 million. This clearly illustrates the close cooperation in cultural exchange between China and the German Democratic Republic, and the welcome and love of Chinese film audiences for the film art of the German Democratic Republic.
    The films of the German Democratic Republic have always been an active assistant in helping the German people build a new life and promote socialist revolution. Under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party, the film art of the German Democratic Republic has become a weapon for defending peace, democracy and socialism for the first time in German film history. The film workers of the German Democratic Republic took the excellent Soviet film art as an example, and inherited the excellent traditions of revolutionary film art born in the workers' movement of their own country. At the same time, the film art of the German Democratic Republic has also systematically developed in the use of film to liquidate militarism and fight against the fascist forces in West Germany. For example, "Colonel Klein" and "Teutonic Sword in Action," which were recently shown in our country, are vivid examples of outstanding contributions and novel creations in this area.
    As early as before this film week, Chinese audiences had already gained ideological enlightenment from German Democratic Republic films such as "Thälmann"; as President Pieck said in his article "A Great Film About Workers": "This film will not only win warm admiration and grateful praise among German workers, but also among peace-loving people in all countries (who all love Ernst Thälmann and have fought to save his life)." According to rough statistics, out of the more than one hundred introductory articles about German Democratic Republic films published in Chinese newspapers and film magazines so far, film reviews recommending "Thälmann" (Parts 1 and 2), "Colonel Klein" and "Teutonic Sword in Action" account for more than half (ninety-four articles). To this day, we still remember the sharp struggle between the two paths presented in the film "Daily Bread," and remember the heroic image of the worker Aells in this film, who resolutely engaged in socialist construction and abandoned illusions about capitalism. We like the DEFA films "Dangerous Cargo" and "Fighting Village" depicting the struggle of West German workers and farmers for peace, and at the same time we are happy for the achievements made by our friends in the German Democratic Republic film industry in reflecting the struggle life of the West German people. Mrs. Weiskopf's film "A Page of Suffering," adapted from Weiskopf's original work "Lissy," and the DEFA director Barlog's "Devil's Circle" adapted from the stage script of the female playwright Czenner (this is Barlog's first work as a director), have all left a deep impression on Chinese audiences.
    The films exhibited in this German Democratic Republic Film Week represent the new achievements of DEFA films in the recent period. "Sailor's Song" and the documentary "Do Not Forget November" are both works that draw on the mass revolutionary movement of German workers and soldiers against Prussian militarism and the overthrow of the feudal dynasty in November 1918, and embody the fundamental lessons of that armed uprising from the perspective of artistic literature. The November Revolution is the most educational page in German national history. It was the largest mass movement in Germany since the Peasants' War in the sixteenth century. The fundamental lesson of this revolution is that because there was a lack of a fighting party of Marxism-Leninism that could lead the proletariat to victory and transform the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, and because the leaders of the right wing of the Social Democratic Party betrayed the working class fighting for socialism, the German bourgeoisie was able to steal power again.
    "Sailor's Song" was produced by the creative collective led by Comrade Maetzig, who had directed "Thälmann" and "Council of the Gods," and won the honorary certificate awarded by the Soviet Peace Defense Committee at the Moscow International Film Festival. "Sailor's Song" begins with an exciting technique, depicting the dramatic scene of revolutionary sailors refusing to shoot their comrades in the struggle. These scenes, like a thunder, set off the revolutionary situation at that time. The film depicts that the great October Revolution greatly strengthened the revolutionary strength of the German working class, and that the break between the German Communist Party, composed of outstanding German revolutionary fighters, and the revisionists and wavering neutralists at that time was an inevitable law of history. The film ends with the experience and demands that the red sailors personally experienced in the November Revolution - resolutely stand under the banner of the Communist Party and constantly fight to expand and consolidate the party's ranks. The clear purpose of this work is obviously directed to the contemporary era, reminding the German people: they should not forget the lessons of the November Revolution, and they should apply it to the struggle against current West German militarism and monopoly capital.
    "Attention! Do not lightly believe the words of the Olengauer (Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party) faction, and judge them according to their actions!" - This is a reminder to the audience at the end of the documentary "Do Not Forget November." It also reminds: "When seizing power and defending power, you should no longer be unarmed! Hammers, sickles and guns, factories and weapons, must and can only be in the hands of the workers!"
    "A Woman" is a work of collaboration between director Barlog and female writer Czenner again. It meticulously describes the beautiful mind and demeanor of a noble German woman - a pioneer in the struggle for women's rights - and her revolutionary activities that gradually combined with the workers' movement. The background reflected in this work is Germany a hundred years ago. At that time, Germany's socio-economic development brought the bourgeois revolution to the historical agenda. And the film, in the dramatic background of the transition from handicraft production to factory machine production, allows its protagonist, the young female poet Louise, to see the workers who live in unbearable labor conditions, and from then on she has her first awakening. The film on the one hand writes about how the ruling monarchs, nobles and representatives of the free bourgeoisie opposed and persecuted the revolutionary forces of the people, on the other hand, it focuses on portraying the strong character of the female poet who grew up in the initial revolutionary launch of the working class. When the revolution suffered setbacks, the female poet mentioned in a passionate speech: "We can finally build a great, unified and free Germany from mistakes, from confusion, from fragments and rubble! Our children will complete the cause that we have not completed!" This paragraph at the end of the film also expresses the ideal of struggle of the entire German people today.
    "The Polonia Express" is a moving historical fact that expresses the fact that the German working class supported the young Soviet Republic when the imperialist armed interventionists invaded the Soviet Republic in 1920. The film expresses the righteous tide of international working class indignation at the armed invasion of the first socialist country by armed interventionists with a compact structure.
    "On the Island of Sylt," this short documentary presents the sharp political commentary style of its makers, the Sundick couple. This kind of film political commentary based on real historical materials is a sharp dagger against Bonn's war policy and the fascist elements in power in West Germany.
    Now, let us warmly congratulate all our friends in the film industry of the German Democratic Republic for the great achievements they have made in the past ten years, and wish them to better promote the new life and new things of the German Democratic Republic with the weapon of film art, and further assist and promote the German Democratic Republic in victoriously completing the great and glorious task of developing and building socialism.

    欢迎德意志民主共和国电影周
    黄钢
    为庆祝德意志民主共和国建国十周年在我国十大城市举办的德意志民主共和国电影周今天开幕了，我们表示热烈的欢迎。十年来，已有三十多部德意志民主共和国的优秀艺术片和数十部富有战斗性的纪录片陆续与我国人民见了面，观众总数已达七千多万人次。这显然说明中国同德意志民主共和国文化交流中的一种亲密合作，和我国电影观众对德意志民主共和国电影艺术的欢迎与喜爱。
    德意志民主共和国电影，一向是协助德国人民建设新生活和推进社会主义革新的积极助手。在德国统一社会党的领导下，德意志民主共和国电影艺术第一次在德国电影历史上成为保卫和平、保卫民主与社会主义的一种武器。德意志民主共和国电影工作者以卓越的苏联电影艺术为范例，并继承了本国工人运动中诞生的革命电影艺术的优秀传统。同时在将电影用之于清算军国主义和对西德的法西斯势力进行斗争的这一方面，德意志民主共和国的电影艺术又有了系统的发展。例如不久前在我国上演的“科伦上尉”和“条顿剑在行动”，就是在这方面有了突出贡献和新颖创造的鲜明例证。
    早在这次电影周举行以前，我国观众已经从“台尔曼”等德意志民主共和国影片中得到思想上的教益；这正如皮克总统在“一部关于工人的伟大影片”一文中所说的：“这部影片将不仅在德国工人中间，并且将在世界各国爱好和平的人民（他们都热爱恩斯特·台尔曼，并且为了营救他的生命，而进行过斗争）中间，赢得热烈的推崇和充满感激心情的赞美。”根据粗略的统计，到目前为止，在我国报刊和电影杂志上发表的有关德意志民主共和国电影的一百多篇介绍文章中，推荐“台尔曼”（上、下集）、“科伦上尉”和“条顿剑在行动”的影评占其中的半数以上（九十四篇）。到现在为止，我们还记得“每日的粮食”影片中所提出的有关两条道路的尖锐斗争，记得这部影片里以工人艾尔斯为代表的坚决从事社会主义建设和摒弃对资本主义幻想的英勇的形象。我们喜欢描绘西德工人农民为和平而斗争的“德发”影片“危险的货物”和“战斗的乡村”，同时为德意志民主共和国电影界的朋友们在反映西德人民斗争生活上而取得的成就感到高兴。魏斯柯普夫夫人根据魏斯柯普夫原作“丽茜”改编的电影“痛苦的一页”，还有“德发”导演巴尔豪斯根据女剧作家琴涅尔的舞台剧本改编的“魔鬼集团”（这是巴尔豪斯导演的第一部作品），都在中国观众中留下了深刻印象。
    这次德意志民主共和国电影周展出的影片，代表了近一时期“德发”影片的新成就。“水兵之歌”和纪录片“不要忘记十一月”，都是取材于1918年11月德国工人和士兵反对普鲁士军国主义和推翻封建皇朝的群众革命运动、并且从艺术文献的角度来体现那次武装起义中的根本教训的作品。十一月革命是德国民族历史上最富有教育意义的一页。它是德国自十六世纪农民战争以来，规模最大的一次群众运动。这次革命的根本教训，就是因为当时缺乏一个领导无产阶级走向胜利、能够把民主革命转变为社会主义革命的马克思列宁主义的战斗的党，就是因为社会民主党右翼的领导者们叛变了为社会主义而奋斗的工人阶级，结果就使得德国资产阶级有可能重新窃取了政权。
    “水兵之歌”是由曾经导演“台尔曼”和“群神会”的梅切格同志领导的创作集体所制作，在这次莫斯科国际电影节上获得苏联保卫和平委员会颁发的荣誉奖状。“水兵之歌”一开始就以激动人心的手法，描绘了革命水兵拒绝枪毙他们斗争中的战友的戏剧场面。这些场面像一阵雷鸣似地烘托出当时山雨欲来风满楼的革命形势。影片描写到伟大的十月革命大大加强了德国工人阶级的革命力量，描写到由德国优秀的革命战士所组成的德国共产党同当时的修正主义者和动摇的中立派分子的决裂是历史的必然规律。影片收尾时表现出红色水兵们在十一月革命中亲身体会出的经验与要求——坚决站在共产党旗帜下，不断地为扩大与巩固党的队伍而斗争。这部作品鲜明的目的性显然是指向当代，它是在提醒德国人民：不应当忘记十一月革命的教训，而且要把它应用在反对当前西德军国主义和垄断资本的斗争之中。
    “注意！不要轻信奥伦豪尔（西德社会民主党主席）那一派人的话，要根据他们的行动来判断他们！”——这是纪录片“不要忘记十一月”结束时对于观众的提醒。它还提醒说：“在夺取政权和保卫政权的时候，再不应当手无寸铁了！铁锤、镰刀和枪枝，工厂和武器，都必须也只能掌握在工人的手里！”
    “一个妇女”是导演巴尔豪斯与女作家琴涅尔再度合作的作品。纤细入微地描写了德国一个具有高尚理想的女性——争取女权的先锋战士的优美心灵和风貌，以及她那同工人运动逐步结合的革命活动。这部作品所反映的背景是在一百年前的德国。当时，德国的社会经济发展把资产阶级革命提到历史日程上来。而影片就在那种从手工场生产过渡到工厂机器的生产的戏剧背景中，让它的主角年青的女诗人露易斯看到那些在难以忍受的劳动条件下生活的工人，从此她有了最初的觉醒。影片一方面写到了当时执政的君主、贵族和自由资产阶级的代表是如何反对与迫害人民革命力量，另一方面却是着力刻划了在工人阶级最初的革命发动之中成长起来的女诗人的坚强性格。当革命遭到挫折后，女诗人在激情的演说中提到：“我们能够从错误中，从迷茫中，从一片碎片和瓦砾中终于建立起一个伟大、统一、自由的德国！我们没有完成的事业，我们的孩子们会给我们完成的！”结束影片的这一段也表达了全德人民今天的奋斗理想。
    “波罗尼亚快车”是表现1920年帝国主义武装干涉者进犯苏维埃共和国，德国工人阶级声援年青苏维埃共和国的动人史实。影片以紧凑的结构，表达了国际工人阶级愤恨武装干涉者对第一个社会主义国家进行武装侵犯的正义的怒潮。
    “在济尔特岛上”这部短纪录片，呈现出它的制作者桑戴克夫妇锐利的政论风格。这类以真实的史料为根据的电影政论是反对波恩战争政策和在西德当权的法西斯分子的锋利的匕首。
    现在，让我们热烈祝贺德意志民主共和国全体电影界朋友们在十年中已取得的巨大成就，预祝他们用电影艺术这一武器更好地宣扬德意志民主共和国的新生活和新事物，进一步协助和促进德意志民主共和国胜利完成发展和建设社会主义的伟大光荣的任务。
