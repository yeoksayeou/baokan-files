    I. The General Development Process of China's Agricultural Socialist Transformation

    Over the past ten years since the founding of the nation, China's vast rural areas, with more than 500 million farmers, like all other fronts, have achieved great historical victories under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong on the road of socialist transformation and socialist construction: completing land reform, realizing agricultural cooperativization, and on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, realizing the people's commune. The face of the countryside has undergone extremely profound and fundamental changes.

    After the national liberation, our Party immediately began to carry out land reform in the newly liberated areas. From 1950 to 1953, after three years, feudal land ownership was eliminated nationwide, and farmers' land ownership was realized, liberating the productive forces and promoting the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production and the entire national economy, while also creating preconditions for the socialist transformation of agriculture. In 1953, the Party Central Committee timely issued the general line for the transition period, which illuminated every corner of the countryside like a lighthouse. China's agricultural socialist transformation began comprehensively and systematically on the basis of the victorious completion of land reform, "striking while the iron was hot." After the basic completion of land reform in the winter of 1952, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams reached 40% of the total number of peasant households in the country, more than 3,000 elementary cooperatives were established, and supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives were also universally established. In 1953, the state began to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and other major agricultural products. By 1954, the number of elementary agricultural cooperatives nationwide had developed to more than 114,000, and in 1955, it developed to 630,000, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 14.2% of the total number of households in the country. The increasingly growing and active participation of the broad masses of farmers in agricultural cooperatives indicated that the high tide of agricultural socialist transformation had arrived. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong observed this inevitable objective situation, timely corrected the mistake of the right-leaning conservative thinking within the Party that suppressed the farmers' enthusiasm for cooperation, and called on the whole Party to actively, enthusiastically, and planfully lead this movement. Thus, the high tide of the rural socialist revolution in the second half of 1955 appeared, and in the second half of 1956, it further developed into advanced agricultural production cooperatives with a completely socialist nature. In terms of the ownership of the means of production, the socialist transformation of agriculture was basically completed, and from then on, the foundation for the growth of capitalism in the countryside was dug up, opening up the source of common prosperity for the broad masses of farmers. Then, in 1957, a rectification campaign and a large-scale socialist education movement were universally carried out in the countryside, achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, which further consolidated and developed the victory of agricultural socialist transformation, and a new situation of national socialist and communist ideological emancipation and a great leap forward in agricultural production emerged.

    The rural people's commune movement launched in the second half of 1958 was produced on the basis of the great ideological emancipation and the great leap forward in production. It is the product of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the product of China's political and economic development. It is the development of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and a reflection of the objective law that the relations of production must adapt to the development of productive forces, not an accidental occurrence. Therefore, in just a few months, on the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of the broad masses of farmers, the original more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives were merged into more than 26,000 people's communes, realizing the people's commune. The emergence of large-scale, comprehensive people's communes characterized by the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the mutual integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and the integration of government and commune is an epoch-making event of great historical significance in China and a sign that China's agriculture has entered a new stage of development. The emergence of the people's commune has even more far-reaching significance: it provides the best social organizational form for accelerating China's socialist construction and preparing for the transition to communism. "Communism is paradise, and the people's commune is the bridge." The broad masses of people regard the people's commune as a "bridge of happiness" for building socialism and thereby moving towards communism. The broad masses of farmers are leaping forward to socialism at an unprecedented speed along this broad avenue.

    II. The Great Historical Significance and Characteristics of China's Agricultural Socialist Transformation

    China is a country where the small-scale peasant economy occupies an absolute advantage. Transforming the small-scale peasant economy into a collective economy is one of the most complex tasks for our Party after winning the national democratic revolution. The reason why we need to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture rapidly and continuously after the completion of land reform has extremely significant historical significance:

    First, it is to build China into a socialist country. At that time, China's economic structure, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, was "both socialist economy, capitalist economy, and individual economy." The Party's general line for the transition period was to "transition this complex economic structure to a single socialist economic structure." And because China is an agricultural country, after the land reform, the small-scale peasant economy, which is like a "vast ocean," accounts for a very large proportion of the entire national economy. Therefore, implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture is an extremely arduous and extremely important historical task for completing the general line of the transition period. At that time, there was also a struggle between two development paths among the broad masses of farmers: on the one hand, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for mutual aid and cooperation was greatly developed, and they resolutely wanted to take the socialist road; but on the other hand, the spontaneous forces of capitalism among a few wealthy middle peasants who demanded "individual efforts to get rich and exploitation to make a fortune" were also rising. If this situation were allowed to develop freely, a new class differentiation of "one family rich, a hundred families poor" would inevitably occur, allowing capitalism to flood the countryside and making the broad masses of farmers suffer again from the exploitation of a few rich peasants. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If socialism does not occupy the rural position, capitalism will occupy it." Facts have educated the broad masses of cadres and farmers; only by organizing and taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation is it the only happy road to get rid of poverty and move towards common prosperity, and only by implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and transitioning the vast small-scale peasant economy to a cooperative socialist economy can our country embark on socialism.

    Second, it is to realize national industrialization. Industrialization is the mainstay of the socialist economy. Without socialist industry, there is no solid national defense and people's welfare, nor is it possible to transform backward agriculture into modern agriculture. However, the development of socialist industry must be based on a fully developed agriculture. Especially in China, a large agricultural country, agriculture occupies an extremely important position. The situation of agriculture has a decisive impact on the development of the entire national economy. It can be said that without a fully developed agriculture, there can be no developed industry. However, if the small-scale peasant economy is not transformed, China's agriculture cannot develop rapidly, nor can it meet the needs of industrialization. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Socialist industrialization cannot be carried out in isolation from agricultural cooperativization," "We cannot put one foot on the basis of socialist industry and the other foot on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy." Therefore, implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and striving for 500 million farmers to participate in socialist construction has become a decisive condition for China to complete industrialization.

    Third, it is to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification. According to China's situation, there are two aspects of the task of fundamentally changing the backward state of agriculture: on the one hand, to thoroughly implement the socialist transformation of agriculture from the economic system, transforming the scattered individual agriculture into collective agriculture; on the other hand, to implement the technical transformation of agriculture, using machines in all departments and places where machines can be used, and realizing the mechanization and electrification of agriculture. However, because China's industrial base is weak, it is impossible to equip agriculture with a large number of machines, fertilizers, etc. all at once. So where is the way out? Is it to wait for industry to develop and have agricultural machinery before implementing agricultural cooperativization? Or is it to implement agricultural cooperativization first, and then gradually realize agricultural mechanization with the development of national industrialization? If the first path is chosen, and the steps of agricultural cooperativization are not followed closely after the land reform, then capitalism will freely flood the countryside, which is unacceptable to the vast majority of farmers. This is an opportunistic path. There is only one way out: under the condition that a large number of machines cannot be used to equip agriculture for the time being, first implement agricultural cooperativization, and then gradually realize agricultural mechanization on the basis of agricultural cooperativization with the development of national industrialization. Facts have proved that as long as the small-scale peasant economy is united into a collective economy, due to the great development of the labor enthusiasm of the producers, even if the original manpower, livestock power, and agricultural implements are still used, agricultural production can still obtain greater development. The continuous increase in production of China's agricultural cooperatives in recent years has powerfully supported socialist industrialization, and at the same time, it is preparing preliminary conditions for agricultural mechanization and electrification. Realizing agricultural cooperativization first without agricultural machinery, and then gradually realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, this is the most suitable and only correct way for China to complete agricultural modernization.

      From the above three points, it can be seen how great the significance of our Party's agricultural socialist transformation immediately following the land reform is for realizing our national industrialization, agricultural modernization, and building China into a socialist country. However, it is not easy to complete such a great task in such an extremely backward country where the agricultural economy is the main body and the small-scale peasant economy occupies an absolute advantage. However, we were able to complete this extremely complex historical task relatively quickly and smoothly in less than five years. What is the reason? This is because:

    First, Chinese farmers have long been under the layers of exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. Hired peasants and poor peasants account for 60% to 70% of the rural population. They have no land or very little land. They are the proletarians and semi-proletarians in the countryside. They have a strong desire to get rid of poverty quickly. At the same time, our Party has long regarded the peasant issue as the central issue of our country's revolution. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "During the democratic revolution, the Chinese Communist Party went deep into the countryside and led the armed revolutionary struggle of encircling the cities from the countryside for as long as twenty-two years. The Party adopted the mass line of firmly relying on the political consciousness and organizational strength of the peasants, mobilizing the peasants to save themselves, overthrow the landlords themselves, obtain land, and defend the land (the Party's policy has continued to be implemented until the land reform after the founding of the People's Republic of China), instead of adopting the bourgeois policy of 'bestowing' land on the peasants, which enabled the Party to establish a strong and reliable revolutionary fortress in the countryside, establish revolutionary armies and revolutionary base areas, and gradually improve the revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary discipline of the broad masses of poor peasants to a level close to that of the revolutionary proletariat."

    Second, China's land reform movement is the most thorough, and it is a model of letting the masses liberate themselves. After the land reform, the broad masses of farmers truly stood up, firmly established the leading advantage of hired peasants, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants in the countryside, and then grasped political power and arms. Land reform not only eliminated the landlord class economically and greatly weakened the rich peasant economy, but also thoroughly overthrew the landlord class politically and isolated the rich peasants, which created preconditions for the socialist transformation of agriculture. The more thorough the land reform, the more beneficial it is to transition to the socialist revolution.

    Third, China's agricultural socialist transformation was carried out soon after the land reform. The basic completion of land reform nationwide was in the winter of 1952, and in 1953, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong timely put forward the Party's general line for the transition period and successively made resolutions on "developing mutual aid and cooperation" and "developing agricultural production cooperatives." Subsequently, between the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, elementary cooperatives had been basically completed nationwide, and in the winter of 1956, they quickly turned to advanced cooperatives. In this way, after the land reform, the democratic revolution was quickly transformed into the socialist revolution in the countryside "striking while the iron was hot," which prevented capitalism in China's countryside from developing greatly, reduced the resistance to the revolution, and thus ensured the smooth advance of agricultural socialist transformation.

    Fourth, China's mutual aid and cooperation movement has had a considerable history. As early as the revolutionary war period, in the revolutionary base areas, our Party had guided farmers to organize agricultural labor mutual aid organizations with socialist buds, such as the labor mutual aid societies and plowing teams in Jiangxi during the land revolution period, and the labor exchange teams and mutual assistance teams in northern Shaanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, and the mutual aid groups in North China, East China, and Northeast China. After the national liberation, this kind of mutual aid organization developed more widely, and agricultural production cooperatives were organized in batches on the basis of mutual aid groups. These mutual aid and cooperation organizations prepared experience and organizational foundation for the agricultural cooperativization movement that began in 1953.

    It is precisely because of the high class consciousness and enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation of the broad masses of farmers, the foundation of the thorough victory of land reform, and our "striking while the iron was hot" to carry out agricultural cooperativization immediately after the completion of land reform, and cooperativization has already had certain experience and organizational preparations, so China's agricultural socialist transformation movement can be realized relatively smoothly and quickly, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has always been very high during the transformation process. Production was not destroyed due to such an earth-shaking reform. On the contrary, agricultural production gradually rose with the completion of agricultural socialist transformation. This is a great victory of Marxism-Leninism in China.

    III. The Guidelines, Steps, and Policies of Agricultural Socialist Transformation

    The Party believes that after the completion of land reform, a positive transformation policy must be adopted for the small-scale peasant economy. Letting it go its own way is wrong. At the same time, the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be adhered to. Using persuasion, demonstration, and state assistance methods to make farmers voluntarily unite. Various transitional steps and transitional forms that are easily accepted by the broad masses of farmers must also be adopted to enable farmers to enter the fully socialist system with preparation and naturally. These transitional steps and transitional forms:

    The first step is simple temporary mutual aid groups of common labor and perennial mutual aid groups that implement certain division of labor and have a small amount of public property on the basis of common labor. The means of production of the members of the mutual aid group are still privately owned, and the land management is not unified, but the laborers unite and carry out collective labor, which has socialist budding factors, and the perennial mutual aid group has more socialist factors than the temporary mutual aid group.

    The second step is to advance to elementary agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of mutual aid groups. This kind of elementary cooperative implements land shares, unified management, and income distribution in proportion to land and labor on the basis of private property. The land remuneration part is distributed according to the amount of land shares of the members, and the labor remuneration part is distributed according to the quantity and quality of the members' participation in collective labor. Livestock, agricultural implements, and other means of production are entered into the cooperative for a reasonable price. The elementary cooperative has more public accumulation than the mutual aid group. Therefore, it has a semi-socialist nature and is a good transitional form for guiding farmers to transition to a completely socialist system.

    The third step is an advanced agricultural production cooperative (that is, a collective farm) of a socialist nature in which basic means of production are completely owned by the collective and distributed entirely according to labor. This kind of advanced cooperative appeared in individual areas after the land reform. By 1954, more than 500 had been developed nationwide. By the winter of 1956, advanced agricultural cooperativization had basically been realized nationwide.

    Practice has proved that this step-by-step combination, gradual transition, gradual transformation, orderly progress, and mutual connection from mutual aid groups with socialist buds to elementary cooperatives with a semi-socialist nature, and then to advanced cooperatives with a completely socialist nature is completely correct. Its benefits, as the Central Committee pointed out, "make the broad masses of farmers not feel sudden when they enter the completely socialist economic system, but have been mentally and materially prepared in advance, thus avoiding all kinds of losses that may be caused by sudden changes."

    The Party also firmly implemented the class policy of "relying on poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and consolidating the unity with upper-middle peasants" in the agricultural socialist transformation movement. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Poor peasants, lower-middle peasants in the new middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants in the old middle peasants (accounting for about 60% to 70% of the rural population), because their economic status is relatively poor or not yet rich, they have the need and enthusiasm to organize cooperatives. In the early stage of running the cooperatives, they should first be absorbed into the cooperatives in batches according to their level of consciousness to form the leading core and backbone force of the agricultural cooperatives. Rich and relatively rich middle peasants account for a small number in the countryside, but they have an important impact on the broad masses of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. They generally support the Communist Party and the People's Government, and some of them have turned over in the land reform, but because their economic status is relatively rich, they inevitably have wavering about taking the road of cooperativization. Therefore, they are generally not absorbed into the cooperatives too early, and they must wait patiently for their consciousness and conduct a longer period of education. When they see that the unit area yield of the agricultural cooperatives and the income level of the members have caught up with and exceeded them, it is unfavorable for them to continue to work independently, and it is more beneficial to participate in the cooperatives, and then absorb them into the cooperatives." At the same time, we adopted the policy of fairly and reasonably pricing production materials such as plowing cattle and agricultural implements for joining the cooperatives, which made the middle peasants not feel disadvantaged when joining the cooperatives. The state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and other major agricultural products starting in 1953, as well as the universal development of rural supply and marketing and credit cooperatives, gave a powerful restriction to the spontaneous tendency of rural capitalism, making them see that the old road of capitalism has been blocked. The fact that agricultural cooperatives are constantly increasing production has also made the relatively rich middle peasants experience that "individual work is not as good as cooperative superiority." So they finally stopped wavering and joined the agricultural cooperatives in batches during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. It is precisely because the Party adopted such a policy that it united the vast majority of the rural population and did not destroy the unity of middle and poor peasants because of the socialist revolution; on the contrary, it mobilized all positive factors. In the entire process of agricultural socialist transformation, agricultural production has also been continuously developed, and there has been no loss of reduced production due to this change.

    The historical task of agricultural cooperativization has been completed, but merely eliminating capitalism in terms of the ownership of the means of production, the victory of the socialist revolution is still not consolidated, and it is also necessary to carry out the socialist revolution on the ideological front and the political front, "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology," so that proletarian ideology occupies a dominant position. After the completion of agricultural socialist transformation, we cannot but continue to encounter the counterattacks and resistance of hostile classes and hostile ideologies. This ideological and political struggle is unavoidable. Therefore, in the second half of 1957, while opposing the rampant attacks of bourgeois rightists in the cities, a large-scale socialist education movement was also universally carried out in the countryside. Using socialist democratic methods such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, and large-character posters, the masses were boldly mobilized. The vast majority of the masses were firmly believed, and the broad masses were allowed to speak freely, fully presenting facts, reasoning, recalling, comparing, and settling accounts. With a large number of irrefutable facts, all kinds of shameless slanders against socialism were refuted. From then on, capitalist ideology was discredited, and socialist ideology radiated brightly, making the broad masses of rural cadres and people "brighten their eyes, recognize the future, and clarify the direction." The consciousness of socialism was greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production was even higher. The superiority of agricultural cooperatives has since been fully developed, and thus the prelude to China's great leap forward in agriculture has begun.

    IV. The Superiority of Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives and Their Consolidation and Development

    The completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture liberated the productive forces, fundamentally solved the contradiction between socialist industry and the small-scale peasant economy, promoted the year-by-year increase in agricultural production, and also promoted the increasing prosperity and development of the entire national economy, fully demonstrating the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

    1956 was the first year after advanced cooperativization. Although it encountered severe natural disasters, grain and other major crops still achieved large increases in production. The total grain output reached 365 billion catties, an increase of 15.4 billion catties over the bumper year of 1955, an increase of more than 148 billion catties over 1949, an increase of more than 56 billion catties over 1952, and an increase of more than 87 billion catties over the highest annual output before liberation, completing the grain production target of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The total agricultural output value reached 58.3 billion yuan, an increase of more than 2.7 billion yuan over 1955, and an increase of 78.8% over 1949. Of the more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives, except for a few that were severely affected by disasters or poorly managed and whose production increase was not significant or slightly reduced, 80% of the cooperatives and 80% of the members increased their income. Agricultural production continued to develop in 1957. In this year, 65 counties and cities nationwide had grain yields per mu that reached the targets of 400 catties, 500 catties, and 800 catties stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, respectively. Cotton yields per mu in 64 counties and cities (accounting for one-seventh of the total cotton fields) reached 60 catties, 80 catties, and 100 catties, respectively. That is to say, these places achieved the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. At the same time, with the continuous improvement and development of agricultural production, the income and material and cultural living standards of farmers have also been significantly improved. According to some incomplete statistics, in 1957, the average consumption level of the rural population nationwide increased by more than 80% compared with 1949, increased by 30% compared with 1952, and also increased significantly compared with 1955. Rural purchasing power increased by 50% compared with 1952, and increased by more than 10% compared with 1955. The economic situation of farmers has been greatly improved. The middle peasants accounted for the majority of rural households. The agricultural cooperatives whose living standards and income levels caught up with and exceeded the wealthy middle peasants before cooperativization accounted for about 20% to 30% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives at that time. The public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives, in addition to various agricultural basic constructions, the accumulated cash, grain, and the addition of various large-scale agricultural implements averaged about 66,000 yuan per agricultural cooperative, averaging more than 290 yuan per household, which prepared the material foundation for the continued development of agriculture.

    Why can China's agricultural cooperatives increase production so much without mechanization? The basic key lies in the realization of agricultural collectivization, the liberation of productive forces, the full mobilization of the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, thereby expanding the scope of labor and the scale of production, and constantly improving labor efficiency.

    Laborers are the basic productive forces of society and the most active and positive factors in productive forces. The vast rural areas of old China were long under feudal rule, and "producers were separated from the means of production." The vast majority of farmers had no land or very little land. Laborers "had no place to use their talents." Many laborers were idle or semi-idle, and there were many unemployed people in the countryside. In this case, abundant material resources could not be used, and productive forces could not be developed. After the land reform, farmers generally received land, and producers were combined with the means of production, and the production situation changed greatly. However, because the small-scale peasant economy of one family and one household as a production unit cannot adopt advanced technology, it is impossible to implement a detailed division of labor, let alone carry out large-scale farmland basic construction. The use of labor is still greatly restricted, thereby restricting the development of productive forces. The mutual aid group is a step forward than the individual economy. However, the mutual aid group is still based on private ownership. It can only engage in common labor according to the production requirements of each household and has not broken the restrictions of private ownership. Therefore, it is still impossible to expand the scope of labor and rationally use labor. Elementary cooperatives further solved this contradiction. Land, labor, and other means of production can be used uniformly, and productive forces have been developed. However, because the elementary cooperative still retains the private ownership of land by the members, a considerable part of the annual income of the cooperative must be distributed according to the land shares, which to a certain extent restricts the labor enthusiasm of the members. At the same time, the elementary cooperative cannot carry out farmland basic construction on the land, and it is impossible to make full use of natural resources to expand the scope of operation and change production conditions, which restricts the scope of use of labor and restricts the full development of productive forces.

    After the realization of advanced cooperativization, the situation has been further improved. Because the advanced cooperative is a collective economy of a socialist nature, land and other major means of production are collectively owned, breaking the shackles of private ownership. The nature of labor has also undergone fundamental changes. The fruits of labor are completely distributed according to the interests of the laborers, which further enhances the labor enthusiasm of the laborers. At the same time, the scale of the advanced cooperative is also relatively large, and the main means of production are collectively owned, which can uniformly manage the land in a planned way, plant according to local conditions, rationally organize labor, use it according to talent, and implement division of labor, multiple operations. The scale of production has been expanded, the number of operating departments has been increased, and the depth and breadth of the march towards nature have been expanded, which has greatly expanded the scope of labor, fully tapped the potential of labor, and improved the utilization rate of labor. Not only has the attendance rate of full labor and semi-labor increased, but also auxiliary labor has been used, and those who did not work in the past have also participated in labor. According to some typical investigations, after advanced cooperativization, the labor attendance rate generally increased by 20% to 30% for male labor and 35% to one time for female labor, and up to more than five times in some cases. A large number of women participated in production labor, and the total number of people participating in labor generally increased by about one-third. "Labor creates value." More labor means more production. This is the main truth of Marxism-Leninism and the root of the superiority of cooperativization.

    However, it is not enough to rely solely on the increase in labor utilization and the labor enthusiasm of the members to fully exert the superiority of the collective economy. We must scientifically organize the labor enthusiasm of the members and constantly improve their labor efficiency in order to fully exert the superiority of the collective economy. Collective labor is different from individual labor, and agricultural production is different from industrial production. It has the characteristics of decentralization. At present, China's agricultural production is also field operation, manual operation, and has strong regional and seasonal characteristics. It is greatly restricted by weather and natural conditions. Without a set of production management systems suitable for these characteristics, the division of labor is not clear, and the production responsibility system is not well established. Then, although the labor attendance rate of the members has increased, the labor efficiency cannot be improved. In this way, the superiority of collective production cannot be fully exerted. This is the reason why the productive forces of cooperatives in various places were not greatly developed in the early stage. After cooperativization, in 1956 and 1957, large-scale and detailed rectification and consolidation of cooperatives were carried out in various places. Not only was the socialist distribution policy implemented, but also a set of management systems and production responsibility systems suitable for the characteristics of agricultural production were worked out. The division of labor between the upper and lower levels became clearer, the labor organization became stricter, and the use became more reasonable, so that the labor efficiency was further improved, the superiority of the advanced cooperative was further exerted, and the productive forces were further developed. So, what problems did the rectification work at that time solve?

    First, the socialist distribution policy was implemented. The Party's principle is to maintain an appropriate ratio between accumulation and consumption, ensure that the cooperative has a certain proportion of accumulation, and strive for the cooperative to expand reproduction year by year. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure a certain distribution ratio so that the majority of members increase their income in order to maintain their lasting production enthusiasm. However, when the production of the cooperative was relatively developed, especially in 1956, the cadres of many cooperatives had an idea of "deducting more and distributing less," wanting to expand public accumulation all at once, but they did not consider that more deduction would inevitably lead to less distribution, and the result would affect the income and labor enthusiasm of the members, and affect the development and consolidation of the cooperative. In order to prevent this phenomenon, the Party Central Committee timely put forward the policy of "deducting less and distributing more" and stipulated that 60% to 70% of the total income of the cooperative should be distributed to the members to ensure that the income of more than 90% of the members increased compared with the previous year. By 1957, the production of the cooperative had further developed, and many cooperative cadres had another idea, paying more attention to increasing the consumption part of the members, while paying less attention to increasing public accumulation. The Party Central Committee timely overcame this bias and stipulated that the public accumulation fund of the advanced cooperative could be expanded from 5% to 10%, and called on the members to work more to run basic constructions such as water conservancy, afforestation, and construction of fertilizer production facilities, and strive to expand reproduction. Regarding the distribution standards of the members, the Party has always adhered to the principle of "distribution according to labor, more labor, more income," but because the family circumstances of the members are different: there are some households in difficulty among the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. They have a large population and little labor, or encounter unexpected events such as illness and funeral, and relying on labor dividends is still not enough to maintain family life; in addition, there are still a small number of widowers, widows, orphans, and disabled members who have lost their labor force and are difficult to make a living. The cooperative cannot sit idly by and do nothing about the difficulties of these people. Therefore, the principle of "mutual assistance and mutual assistance, and separate care" is adopted. Appropriate subsidies are given to the funeral and illness of households in difficulty from the public welfare fund; those with auxiliary labor in the family are helped to operate more family sideline occupations; those with special skills are allowed to engage in their original skills, such as driving carts, repairing pots, hairdressing, sewing clothes, weaving, and raising fruit trees; for widowers, widows, orphans, and disabled members, the five guarantees (guaranteed food, guaranteed clothing, guaranteed fuel, guaranteed education, and guaranteed burial) are implemented and fully covered by the public welfare fund. This kind of mutual assistance and mutual assistance measures actually has the nature of communist buds.

    Second, the system of "unified management and hierarchical management" has been established. When cooperatives were first established in various places, the power was generally excessively concentrated. No matter how big or small the matter was, the president of the cooperative had to be consulted, and the production team had no right to handle it. This made the management organization of the cooperative huge and trapped in bureaucracy. On the other hand, the production team had no right to adapt to local conditions and wasted opportunities for agricultural production measures, and increased unnecessary disputes between the cooperative and team cadres. The cooperative rectification in various places adopted the method of "dividing power between the cooperative and the team" according to the principle of "unified management and hierarchical management," clarifying the responsibilities and powers of both the cooperative and the team. It was determined that the management committee of the cooperative is the institution for unified planning, unified management, unified distribution, and unified leadership, while the production team is the basic-level unit responsible for managing agricultural production under the leadership of the cooperative, and sideline production run by the cooperative is formed into another sideline production team responsible for management. This management system is greatly conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels and promoting the great development of cooperative production.

    Third, a "layered contracted production responsibility system" has been established and improved. The production team is responsible for cultivating a certain amount of land, plowing cattle, and agricultural implements contracted from the cooperative. How many work points should be calculated, and how much yield should be handed over at harvest? How much money should be spent on fertilizer and agricultural implement repair? In the early stage of running the cooperative, some cooperatives once adopted the method of "calculating according to the actual situation," that is, how much work is done, how many work points are calculated, how much grain is produced, how much grain is handed over, how much money is spent, and how much money is reported. As a result, not only did the cooperative and the team argue about more or less and entangled endlessly, but also the teams argued with each other because the land was good or bad, the plowing cattle were strong or weak, the water sources were thick or thin, and the reporting of work and production was false or true, which affected unity. How to solve these internal contradictions? The "three guarantees (that is, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, and guaranteeing costs) and the compensation and reward system (that is, rewarding for overproduction and compensating for reduced production)" were unanimously adopted in the rectification of cooperatives in various places. After the implementation of this system, not only was the relationship between the cooperative and the team fixed, and the production responsibility was clarified; that is, because the production was fixed between the teams, overproduction could be rewarded, instead of distributing all the income regardless of whether the production was good or bad, which made the rich teams with good production and high income satisfied. Those poor teams with poor production conditions and low income worked hard to improve production conditions with the support of the cooperative and the state, striving to catch up with the rich teams, and became more active. Therefore, this system is a production responsibility system suitable for the current characteristics of agricultural production, and it is a good system to encourage members to work actively, improve technology, and improve labor efficiency. After communization, this system is still preserved, and the part of the overproduction reward is used as the basis for the partial ownership system of the production team, which further consolidates this system. Below the production team, which is the "three guarantees" unit, there are also several temporary work groups. The relationship between these work groups and the production team is generally the "contracted work system," that is, the work group contracts work to the production team in different seasons and different operations, by area or by section. After the work points are fixed, if the actual work done is less than the number of contracted work points because the work group has high technology and fast actions, the team will not deduct work points, and no additional work points will be added if more work is done; this not only reduces the trouble of arguing about more or less between the team and the group, but also promotes the work group to study technology and improve labor efficiency.

    Fourth, the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" and "running the cooperative democratically" has been implemented. The Party Central Committee instructed that "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" is the fundamental policy of socialist agricultural management.

　　中国农业的社会主义改造
　　邓子恢
    一、中国农业社会主义改造的一般发展过程
    建国十年来，拥有五亿多农民的我国广大农村，和其他各个战线一样，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的道路上，取得了具有历史意义的伟大胜利：完成了土地改革，实现了农业合作化，随着在农业合作化的基础上，又实现了人民公社化。农村面貌发生了极为深刻的根本性的变化。
    在全国解放后，我党立即着手在新解放区实行土地改革，从1950年到1953年，经过了三年时间，在全国范围内消灭了封建的土地所有制，实现了农民的土地所有制，解放了生产力，推进了农业生产和整个国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，同时，也给农业的社会主义改造创造了前提条件。1953年党中央适时的发布了关于过渡时期的总路线，像灯塔一样地照亮了农村的各个角落，我国的农业社会主义改造，就在土地改革胜利完成的基础上，“趁热打铁”，全面地有步骤地开始了。到了1952年冬土地改革基本完成之后，各地参加互助组的农户已达全国总农户40％，初级合作社也建立了三千多个，供销合作、信用合作组织也普遍建立起来，1953年国家开始对粮食及其他主要农产品实行统购统销政策；到1954年全国初级农业合作社已发展到十一万四千多个，1955年发展到六十三万个，入社农户占全国总农户14.2％。广大农民这种日益增长的、积极的参加到农业社中来的情况，表明了农业的社会主义改造高潮已经到来了。党中央和毛泽东同志观察到这种必然到来的客观形势，及时地纠正了党内抑制农民合作积极性的右倾保守思想的错误，号召全党，积极地满怀热情地、有计划地去领导这个运动。于是，出现了1955年下半年的农村社会主义革命高潮，1956年下半年又进一步发展到完全社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社。在生产资料所有制方面基本上完成了对农业的社会主义改造，从此就挖掉了资本主义在农村中生长的基础，开辟了广大农民共同富裕的源泉。接着，1957年，在农村中普遍开展了整风整社运动和大规模的社会主义教育运动，取得了在政治战线上、思想战线上的社会主义革命的决定性胜利，这就进一步地巩固和发展了农业社会主义改造的胜利，出现了全民性的社会主义和共产主义思想大解放，农业生产大跃进的新局面。
    1958年下半年展开的农村人民公社化运动，就是在思想大解放和生产大跃进的基础上产生的。它是党的社会主义建设总路线的产物，是我国政治经济发展的产物。它是高级农业生产合作社的发展，是生产关系必须适应生产力发展的客观规律的反映，而不是偶然出现的。所以，在短短几个月的时间内，在广大农民自觉自愿的基础上，由原来七十多万个农业社合并成为二万六千多个人民公社，实现了人民公社化。大型的，综合性的以农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展、工、农、商、学、兵相互结合、政社合一为特点的人民公社的出现，是我国划时代的有重大历史意义的事件，是我国农业进到一个新的发展阶段的标志。人民公社的出现，还有更深远的意义：它为加速我国社会主义建设，为向共产主义过渡作准备提供了最好的社会组织形式。“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁”，广大群众把人民公社看做是建设社会主义，并由此走向共产主义的“幸福桥”，广大农民正沿着这条宽阔的康庄大道，以空前未有的速度向社会主义飞跃前进。
    二、中国农业社会主义改造的伟大历史意义及其特点
    我国是一个小农经济占绝对优势的国家，把小农经济改造成为集体经济，是我党在取得全国民主革命胜利之后，最复杂的任务之一。我们所以需要在完成了土地改革之后，迅速地不间断地进行农业的社会主义改造，是有着极为重大的历史意义的：
    首先，是为了把我国建成为社会主义国家。当时我国的经济结构，正如刘少奇同志所说是“既有社会主义经济、又有资本主义经济、又有个体经济”，党在过渡时期的总路线，就是要把这种“复杂的经济结构，过渡到单一的社会主义的经济结构”。而由于我国是一个农业国，在土地改革之后，“汪洋大海”似的小农经济在整个国民经济中又占极大的比重，所以实行农业的社会主义改造，又是完成过渡时期总路线的极艰巨而又极重要的历史任务。当时在广大农民群众中也存在着两条发展道路的斗争：一方面，是广大贫农下中农互助合作的积极性有了极大的发扬，他们坚决要走社会主义道路；但一方面少数富裕中农要求“单干发家，剥削致富”的资本主义自发势力也在抬头；这种状况，如让其自流发展下去，必然会出现“一家富裕，百家贫穷”的新的阶级分化，让资本主义在农村中泛滥起来，使广大农民重新遭受少数富农的盘剥。正如毛泽东同志所说：“农村阵地，社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领”。事实教育了广大干部和广大农民；只有组织起来走互助合作的道路，才是摆脱贫穷走向共同富裕的唯一幸福的道路，也只有实行农业的社会主义改造，把广大的小农经济过渡到合作化的社会主义经济，我们的国家才能走上社会主义。
    其次，是为了实现国家工业化。工业化是社会主义经济的主体，没有社会主义工业，便没有巩固的国防和人民的福利，也不可能把落后的农业，改造成为现代化的农业。但是，社会主义工业的发展，必须建立在有充分发展的农业的基础之上，特别是我国这样一个大的农业国，农业占着极为重要的地位，农业的情况如何，对于整个国民经济的发展有着决定性的影响，可以说没有充分发达的农业，就不可能有发达的工业。但是，小农经济不进行改造，我国农业就不可能得到迅速的发展，也就不可能满足工业化的需要，正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“社会主义工业化是不能离开农业合作化而孤立地去进行的”，“我们不能把一只脚踩在社会主义工业的基础上，而把另一只脚踩在小农经济的基础上”。因此，实行农业的社会主义改造，争取五亿农民来参加社会主义建设，就成为我国完成工业化的决定性条件。
    再次，是为了实现农业机械化电气化。按照我国的情况，从根本上改变农业的落后状态，有两个方面的任务：即一方面，要从经济制度上，彻底地实行农业的社会主义改造，把分散的个体农业，改造成为集体农业；另一方面，要实行农业的技术改造，在一切能使用机器操作的部门和地方统统使用机器操作，实现农业的机械化和电气化。但是，由于我国工业基础薄弱，不可能一下子用很多的机械、化肥等等去装备农业，那么出路何在呢？是等待工业发展了，有了农业机械再来实行农业合作化呢？还是先实行农业合作化，然后再随着国家工业化的发展，逐步实现农业机械化呢？如果选择第一条道路，在土地改革以后，不紧跟着采取农业合作化的步骤，那么资本主义就会在农村中自由泛滥起来，这是绝大多数农民所不能忍受的，这是机会主义的道路。出路只有一条，就是：在一时还不能有大量机械来装备农业的条件下，首先实行农业合作化，进而在农业合作化的基础上，随着国家工业化的发展，逐步实现农业机械化。事实证明：只要小农经济联合成为集体经济，由于生产者的劳动积极性的大大发挥，尽管还是使用原有的人力、畜力和农具，也可以使农业生产获得较大的发展。几年来我国农业合作社的不断增产，有力地支援了社会主义工业化，同时也正为农业机械化、电气化准备了初步条件。在没有农业机械的条件下，先实现农业合作化，再在农业合作化的基础上，逐步实现农业机械化、电气化，这就是我国完成农业现代化的最适宜的唯一正确的道路。
      从上述三点，可以看出我们党在土地改革后紧跟着进行农业的社会主义改造，这对实现我们国家工业化、农业现代化，把我国建成为社会主义国家有着多么伟大的意义。但是在我国农业经济占主体、小农经济占绝对优势、这样一个极端落后的国家要完成这样一个伟大任务是不容易的，而我们前后不到五年时间，竟能够比较迅速而顺利地完成了这个极端复杂的历史任务，这是什么原因呢？这是因为：
    第一，中国农民长期处于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的层层剥削压迫之下，雇农、贫农占农村人口60％到70％，他们没有土地
  或很少土地，是农村的无产者和半无产者，他们有着迅速摆脱贫穷的强烈愿望。同时，我们党长期以来，把农民问题作为我国革命的中心问题，正如刘少奇同志所指出的：“在民主革命时期，中国共产党就深入农村，领导了农村包围城市的武装革命斗争，达二十二年之久。党采取了坚决依靠农民的政治觉悟和组织力量、发动农民自己救自己、自己打倒地主、取得土地、保卫土地的群众路线的方针（党的这个方针一直继续贯彻执行到中华人民共和国成立以后的土地改革中），而不是采取与此相反的把土地‘恩赐’给农民的资产阶级的方针，就使党在农村中建立了强大的可靠的革命堡垒，建立了革命军队和革命根据地，把广大贫苦农民的革命积极性和革命纪律性逐步提高到接近于革命无产阶级的水平”。
    第二，我国的土地改革运动是最彻底的，是放手发动群众，是“群众自己解放自己”的典范。经过土地改革，广大农民就真正的站起来了，巩固地确立了雇农、贫农、下中农在农村中的领导优势，进而掌握了政权和武装。土地改革不仅在经济上消灭了地主阶级和大大地削弱了富农经济，而且在政治上彻底地打倒了地主阶级和孤立了富农，这就为农业的社会主义改造创造了前提条件，土地改革越彻底，过渡到社会主义革命也就越有利。
    第三，我国的农业社会主义改造是在土地改革之后不久就紧接着进行的。全国基本上完成土地改革是在1952年冬，而在1953年党中央和毛泽东同志就及时地提出党在过渡时期的总路线，并先后作出“发展互助合作”和“发展农业生产合作社”的决议。随后，在1955年冬和1956年春间，就已经在全国范围内基本上完成初级化，1956年冬又迅速转到了高级化，这样在土地改革之后，就“趁热打铁”地在农村中从民主革命迅速转到社会主义革命，就使我国农村资本主义来不及大发展，就减少了革命的阻力，从而保证了农业社会主义改造的顺利前进。
    第四，我国的互助合作运动已经有了相当长的历史。早在革命战争时期，在革命根据地中，我党已经引导农民组织了带有社会主义萌芽的农业劳动互助组织，例如土地革命时期，江西的劳动互助社和耕田队，抗日战争时期陕北的变工队、扎工队，华北华东和东北各地的互助组等。全国解放之后，这种互助组织就更广泛地发展起来，并在互助组的基础上成批地组织农业生产合作社。这些互助合作组织就为1953年开始的农业合作化运动准备了经验和组织基础。
    正由于有了广大农民群众的高度阶级觉悟和互助合作的积极性，有了土地改革彻底胜利的基础，我们又是趁热打铁地在土地改革完成之后就紧接着进行农业合作化，而合作化又已经有了一定的经验和组织准备，所以我国的农业社会主义改造运动就能够比较顺利而迅速地实现，而且在改造过程中广大农民群众的生产积极性始终很高涨，并没有因为这样一个翻天复地的改革而引起生产上的破坏，相反地农业生产还随着农业社会主义改造的完成，而逐步地高涨起来。这是马克思列宁主义在中国的伟大胜利。
    三、农业社会主义改造的方针、步骤和政策
    党认为在土地改革完成之后，对小农经济必须采取积极改造的方针，放任自流是错误的，同时，也必须坚持自愿和互利的原则；用说服、示范和国家援助的方法，使农民自愿联合起来；还必须采取易为广大农民所接受的种种过渡步骤和过渡形式，使农民有准备地自然而然地进入完全社会主义制度。这种过渡步骤和过渡形式：
    第一步，是简单的共同劳动的临时互助组，和在共同劳动的基础上实行某些分工分业，并有少量公共财产的常年互助组。互助组组员的生产资料仍旧是私有的，土地经营并不统一，但是劳动者联合起来，进行集体劳动，这一点就具有社会主义萌芽的因素，常年互助组则比临时互助组有着更多的社会主义因素。
    第二步，是在互助组的基础上，进到初级农业生产合作社。这种初级合作社是在私有财产基础上，实行土地入股、统一经营、收益按土地和劳力比例分配。土地报酬部分，按社员入股土地多少进行分配，劳动报酬部分，按社员参加集体劳动的数量和质量分配。牲畜、农具及其他生产资料入社，则取得合理的代价。初级社比互助组又有了较多的公共积累，因而，它具有半社会主义的性质，是引导农民过渡到完全社会主义制度的一种很好的过渡形式。
    第三步，是基本生产资料完全归集体所有，完全按劳分配的社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社（也就是集体农庄）。这种高级社在土地改革之后，即在个别地区出现，1954年全国已发展到五百多个，到1956年冬，全国已经基本上实现了高级农业合作化。
    实践证明：这种由具有社会主义萌芽的互助组，到半社会主义性质的初级社，再到完全社会主义性质的高级合作社，逐步联合、逐步过渡、逐步改造、循序渐进，而又互相衔接的步骤是完全正确的。它的好处，正如中央所指出的：“使广大农民在他们进到完全社会主义经济制度的时候，不感到突然，而是事先有了精神的和物质的准备的，因而避免了由于突然变化所可能引起的种种损失。”
    党在农业社会主义改造运动中又坚定地贯彻了“依靠贫农、下中农，巩固的联合上中农”的阶级政策。毛泽东同志指出：“贫农、新中农中的下中农、老中农中间的下中农（约占农村人口的60％至70％），由于他们的经济地位比较贫苦，或者还不富余，他们有组织合作社的需要和积极性，在办社初期，应该首先按照他们的觉悟程度，分期分批的吸收到合作社中来，使他们形成为农业社的领导核心和骨干力量。富裕的和比较富裕的中农在农村中占很少数，但是，他们对于广大贫农、下中农有着重要的影响，他们一般是拥护共产党和人民政府的，有些还是在土改中翻身的，但是由于他们的经济地位比较富余，对走合作化道路就有不可避免的动摇性。因此，一般的不去过早吸收他们入社，要耐心等待他们的觉悟，进行较长期的教育，等他们看到农业社的单位面积产量和社员的收入水平赶上和超过了他们的时候，继续单干下去，对他们不利，参加合作社反而有利的时候，再来吸收他们入社。”同时我们采取了耕牛、农具等生产资料公平合理地作价入社的政策，又使中农入社的时候不感觉吃亏。从1953年开始的国家对粮食及其他主要农产品的统购统销政策，以及农村供销、信贷合作社的普遍发展，对于农村资本主义自发倾向给了有力的限制，使他们看到资本主义的老路已经走不通。农业合作社不断增产的事实，使比较富裕的中农也体验到“单干不如合作社优越”。于是他们才最终地停止了动摇，在农业合作化高潮中，纷纷地成批地参加到农业合作社中来。正因为党采取了这样的政策，团结了农村人口的绝大多数，并没有因为实行社会主义革命而破坏了中贫农的团结；相反地，把一切积极因素都调动起来了，在农业社会主义改造的全部过程中，农业生产也得到了不断的发展，并没有由于这种变革而引起减产的损失。
    农业合作化的历史任务完成了，但是，仅仅在生产资料所有制方面消灭了资本主义，社会主义革命的胜利还是不巩固的，还必须进行思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，“兴无灭资”，使无产阶级思想占统治地位。农业社会主义改造完成之后，不能不继续遇到敌对阶级和敌对思想的反攻和抵抗。这一场思想上、政治上的斗争是不可避免的。因此，在1957年下半年，与城市里反对资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的同时，在农村中也普遍进行了大规模的社会主义教育运动，运用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报等社会主义的民主方式，放手发动群众，坚定地相信群众的大多数，让广大群众畅所欲言，充分地摆事实、讲道理、回忆、对比、算账，以大量的无可争辩的事实，驳倒了各种反对社会主义的无耻谰言。从此资本主义思想搞臭了，社会主义思想光芒四射，使广大农村干部和群众“擦亮了眼睛，认清了前途，明确了方向”，社会主义的自觉性大大提高，生产积极性更加高涨了。农业社的优越性从此得到了充分地发挥，并从而展开了我国农业大跃进的序幕。
    四、高级农业社的优越性所在及其巩固和发展
    农业的社会主义改造的完成，解放了生产力，从根本上解决了社会主义工业和小农经济之间的矛盾，促进了农业生产的逐年高涨，也促进了整个国民经济的日趋繁荣和发展，充分地显示了社会主义制度有着无可比拟的优越性。
    1956年，是高级合作化后的第一年，虽然遇到了严重的自然灾害，但粮食及其他主要农作物都获得了大增产，粮食总产量达到了三千六百五十亿斤，比丰收的1955年还增加一百五十四亿斤，比1949年增加一千四百八十多亿斤，比1952年增加了五百六十多亿斤，比解放前最高年产量也增加了八百七十多亿斤，提前完成了第一个五年计划的粮食生产指标。农业总产值达到了五百八十三亿元，比1955年增加了二十七亿多元，比1949年增加了78.8％。七十多万个农业社，除了少数受灾严重，或者经营管理不善，增产不够显著或者略有减产之外，80％的社和80％的社员都增加了收入。1957年农业生产又获得了继续发展。这一年全国有六十五个县、市粮食亩产量分别达到了全国农业发展纲要所规定的四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标。棉花亩产量有六十四个县、市（占棉田总面积的七分之一）分别达到了六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的指标。这就是说，在这些地方提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要所规定的要求。同时，随着农业生产的不断提高和发展，农民的收入和物质文化生活水平也有显著提高。据若干不完全的统计，1957年全国农村人口平均的消费水平，比1949年增加了80％以上，比1952年增加了30％，比1955年也有显著的增加。农村购买力比1952年增加了50％，比1955年增加10％以上。农民的经济状况有了很大的改善，中农占农村户口的大多数，生活水平和收入水平赶上和超过合作化以前富裕中农的农业社，大约占当时农业社总数的百分之二十至三十以上。农业社的公共积累，除了各项农业基本建设之外，积累的现金、粮食及添置各种大型农具，平均每个农业社约合六万六千多元，平均每户二百九十多元，这就为农业的继续发展准备了物质基础。
    为什么在没有机械化的条件下，我国的农业合作社能够如此增产呢？基本关键在于实现了农业的集体化，解放了生产力，充分调动了广大农民的劳动积极性，从而扩大了劳动范围和生产规模，并使劳动效率不断提高。
    劳动者是社会的基本生产力，是生产力中最活动最积极的因素。旧中国的广大农村长期处于封建统治之下，“生产者与生产资料脱离”，广大农民没有土地或很少土地，劳动者“英雄无用武之地”，许多劳动力闲置或半闲置，农村失业群众很多，在这种情况下，丰富的物质资源无法利用，生产力得不到发展。土地改革之后，农民普遍分得了土地，生产者与生产资料结合起来了，生产情况就有了很大改变。但是，由于一家一户作为一个生产单位的小农经济，无法采用先进技术，不可能实行劳动上的细致分工，更无法进行大规模的农田基本建设，劳动力使用仍然受到极大限制，从而束缚了生产力的发展。互助组比个体经济前进了一步，但是，互助组仍是建立在私有制基础之上，它只能按照各户的生产要求，从事共同劳动，没有打破私有制的限制，因而，还不可能扩大劳动范围，合理的使用劳动力。初级社，进一步地解决了这个矛盾，土地、劳力及其他生产资料可以统一使用，生产力得到了发展。但是由于初级社还保留了社员土地私有权，合作社全年收入中有不少一部分要按照入社土地进行分配，这就在一定程度上限制了社员的劳动积极性。同时，初级合作社也不可能在土地上进行农田基本建设，不可能充分利用自然资源来扩大经营范围，改变生产条件，这样就限制了劳动力的使用范围，束缚了生产力的充分发展。
    在实现了高级合作化以后，情况进一步改善了。由于高级社是社会主义性质的集体经济，土地及其他主要生产资料都属于集体所有，打破了私有制的束缚，劳动的性质因而也发生了根本变化，劳动的成果完全按照劳动者的利益进行分配，这就进一步发挥了劳动者的生产积极性。同时，高级社的规模也比较大，主要生产资料又属于集体所有，这就可以有计划的统一经营土地，因地种植，可以合理地组织劳力，因才使用，并实行分工分业，多种经营。生产的规模扩大了，经营的部门加多了，向自然进军的深度和广度扩展了，这就大大地扩大了劳动范围，充分的发掘了劳动潜力，提高了劳动的利用率，不仅全劳力半劳力的出勤率增加了，而且辅助劳力也使用上了，过去不劳动的也参加劳动了。据若干典型调查，高级化以后，劳动出勤率比高级化以前，男劳力一般增加20％到30％，女劳力增加了35％至一倍，多的达五倍以上，大批妇女参加了生产劳动，参加劳动的总人数一般增加了三分之一左右。“劳动创造价值”，多劳动就多生产，这是马列主义的主要真理，也是合作化优越性的根源所在。
    但是仅仅依靠劳动利用率的增加，依靠社员的劳动热情，还不能充分发挥集体经济的优越性，还必须把社员的劳动热情加以科学的组织，不断提高他们的劳动效率，才可能使集体经济的优越性得到充分发挥。集体劳动不同于个体劳动，农业生产又不同于工业生产，它具有分散性的特点，目前我国的农业生产又是野外操作、手工操作，地区性、季节性很强，受到天时、自然条件的限制很大，如果没有适合于这些特点的一套生产管理制度，分工不明确，生产责任制未很好建立，那么社员的劳动出勤率虽然增加，但劳动效率不能提高，这样集体生产的优越性也就不能得到充分的发挥，各地合作社在初办时，生产力发展不很大，就是这个原因。合作化之后在1956年、1957年各地都进行了大规模的细致的整顿巩固合作社的工作，不仅贯彻了社会主义的分配政策，而且摸出了一套适合于农业生产特点的管理制度和生产责任制，上下分工更明确，劳动组织得更严密，使用得更合理，从而使劳动效率提得更高，高级社的优越性就进一步发挥，生产力也就更大的发展起来了。那么，当时的整社工作解决了些什么问题呢？
    第一，是贯彻执行了社会主义的分配政策。党的原则是保持积累与消费之间的适当比例，保证合作社有一定比例的积累，争取合作社能够逐年扩大再生产。同时又要保证一定的分配比例，使大多数社员增加收入，以保持他们持久的生产积极性。但当合作社生产得到比较发展的时候，特别是1956年，不少合作社的干部存在着一种“多扣少分”的想法，想一下子扩大公共积累，但他们没有考虑到多扣必然少分，其结果就要影响到社员的收入和劳动积极性，影响到社的发展和巩固。为了防止这种现象，党中央及时提出“少扣多分”的方针，并规定要把合作社总收入的60％至70％分配给社员，保证90％以上的社员收入比上年有所增加。到了1957年合作社生产进一步发展了，许多社干部又有另外一种想法，更多地注意增加社员的消费部分，而对增加公共积累则注意较少，党中央又及时克服了这种偏向，规定高级社的公积金可以由5％扩大到10％，并号召社员多出工，来举办兴修水利、植树造林、兴建积肥造肥设备等基本建设，力争扩大再生产。关于社员的分配标准，党一贯坚持“按劳分配、多劳多得”的原则，但由于社员的家庭情况各有不同：在贫农下中农中有一些困难户，他们人口多、劳力少，或者遇到疾病丧葬等意外事故，依靠劳动分红仍不足以维持家庭生活；此外尚有少数鳏寡孤独残废等社员，他们丧失劳动力，难以为生，合作社对这些人的困苦不能坐视不救，因而采取“互助互济、分别照顾”的原则，对困难户的丧葬疾病由公益金项下给以适当补助；对家庭有辅助劳力的，则帮助他们多经营些家庭副业；对有特殊技艺的则允许他们从事原来技艺，如赶大车、补锅、理发、缝衣、编织、养果树等；对鳏寡孤独残废等社员，则实行五保（保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬）由公益金全部包下来。这种互助互济的措施，实际上带有共产主义萌芽的性质。
    第二，是确定了“统一经营、分级管理”的制度。各地合作社初建时，一般都是权力过分集中，事无大小都得请示社长，生产队无权处理，这就使社的管理机构庞大，而又陷于事务主义。另一方面生产队无权因地因时制宜，也使农业生产措施往往贻误时机，并增加了社队干部之间不必要的纠纷。各地整社时就根据“统一经营，分级管理”的原则，采取了“社队分权”的办法，把社队双方应负的职责与权限划分清楚，确定合作社管理委员会是统一筹划、统一经营、统一分配、统一领导的机构，而生产队则是在社的领导下负责管理农业生产的基层单位，社办副业则另成副业组，负责管理。这种管理体制，大大有利于调动各级干部的积极性，促进合作社生产的大发展。
    第三，是建立和健全了“分层包干的生产责任制”。生产队向社承领了一定的土地、耕畜、农具负责耕种，究竟该算多少工分，收获时应交多少产量？所下肥料和农具修配等又要多少钱？在办社初期有些社曾经一度采取“按实计算”办法，即做多少工，算多少工，产多少粮，交多少粮，用多少钱，报多少钱，结果不仅社与队之间争多较少，纠缠不休，而且队与队之间也因为土地有好坏，耕畜有强弱，水源有厚薄，报工报产有虚有实，而互相隐瞒争吵，影响团结。这些内部矛盾如何解决呢？各地在整社中都不约而同地采取了“三包（即包工、包产、包成本）、赔奖制”（即超产提成奖励，减产者赔）。这种制度实行之后，不仅社与队之间的关系固定下来，生产责任明确了；即队与队之间也因为包产定下来以后，超产可以提奖，而不是不管生产好坏、收入高低一律拉平分配，从而使生产好收入高的富队感到满意，那些生产条件差收入低的穷队则在合作社与国家支援下努力改善生产条件，争取赶上富队，而更加积极起来。所以这种制度是适合于目前农业生产特点的生产责任制，是鼓舞社员积极劳动、改进技术、提高劳动效率的良好制度。公社化之后，仍然保存这种制度，并把超产提奖部分作为生产小队部分所有制的基础，就更加巩固了这种制度。作为“三包”单位的生产队之下还分成若干临时性的作业组，这些作业组对生产队的关系，一般是实行“包工制”：即作业组按不同季节、不同作业，分片或者分地段向生产队包工。这种工分包定之后，如果因为该作业组技术高、动作快、实际出工少于包工数，队里不扣工，出工多了也不增补；这样不仅减少队组之间争多较少的麻烦，而且可以促进作业组钻研技术，提高劳动效率。
    第四，是贯彻执行了“勤俭办社”和“民主办社”的方针。党中央指示：“勤俭办社”是社会主义农业经营的根本方针。勤，就是要充分地发动社员勤劳生产，扩大经营范围，发展多种经济，进行精耕细作。俭，就是要厉行节约，降低成本，反对铺张浪费。在整社中，农业社普遍贯彻了这个方针：在注意发展农业的同时，大力开展多种经营，增加了生产门路；在保证搞好当年生产的时候，还有计划地进行了基本建设；对于文化教育、交通运输、体育卫生等事业，则随着生产的发展逐步兴办。这样，就克服了一些农业社初办时期曾经出现的铺张浪费现象，有效地促进了生产的发展。农业社还普遍地推行了一套群众路线的民主管理的方法，这就是依靠群众，遇事和群众商量，把老农的生产经验和青年的革命精神结合起来，充分地运用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报等社会主义民主的方式，做什么，鸣放什么，辩论什么，广泛地吸收群众的意见，及时地改进领导、改进工作。实行了财政公开，经常取得群众的监督，以及干部参加生产、领导生产，干部、群众、技术人员三结合种试验田制度，……等等，这就使得广大社员真正参加了农业社的管理工作，大大提高了社员主人翁的思想，鼓舞了群众的劳动积极性。
    第五，是进行了全面规划，加强对社员的前途教育。由于各地在整社中进行了上述一系列工作，不仅大大扩大了劳动范围和社员的劳动积极性，而且大大提高了劳动效率，使高级社的优越性获得了充分发挥，农村生产力得到了进一步发展。但社员劳动力如果用得不合理，安排不适当，那生产力也不可能更大的发展。因此，党又普遍地领导各地各社从上而下，又从下而上地进行了以生产为中心的全面规划，把当年生产与基本建设、农业生产与林牧业、渔业、副业生产，生产建设与交通运输和文教卫生建设等都全面作了规划，各方面用工保持一定的比例，使劳动力安排得更适当、使用得更合理。当时党特别强调要把劳动力多用到农业基本建设方面，只有大规模的基本建设，才能扩大再生产，才能促进农副业生产的大跃进。与此同时，党又在农村中广泛地进行建设社会主义新农村的前途教育。特别是当时党中央根据毛泽东同志的建议，适时地提出“全国农业发展纲要”，展开全民讨论，给广大农民以深刻的前途教育，描绘出一幅光明灿烂的前景，这实际上是一次建设社会主义新农村的全民大动员，明确了方向，鼓舞了干劲，批判和克服了形形色色的右倾保守思想，极大地鼓舞了广大干部和群众的劳动热情，调动了一切积极因素，形成巨大的物质力量，有力地促进农业生产以及农村各项事业不断的发展。
    农民群众的生产积极性，首先就带来了农业基本建设的高潮，党的社会主义建设总路线和“苦战三年，基本改变农村面貌”的号召，又给了农民以极大的鼓舞。因此以兴修水利，积肥造肥为中心的农业生产运动，便从1957年冬季展开了农业生产大跃进的序幕。从1957年冬季开始至1958年秋季这一个农业年度中，全国农田灌溉面积就扩大了四亿八千万亩，植树造林二亿六千万亩，由于绿化造林所控制的水土流失面积达三十一万平方公里，改造低洼易涝面积二亿零六百多万亩，作为肥料主要来源的毛猪已发展到一亿六千万头，成绩之大是史无前例的。
    农民群众的生产积极性，也带来改革工具的积极性，双轮双铧犁等新式农具的推广工作在1956年就形成了高潮；1958年，群众在改良农具方面更有许多新创造，新农具的制造和使用达二亿一千多万件。事实很明显，群众的生产运动就引起了技术革新运动。
    农民群众的生产积极性，还引起了耕作技术的改进，精耕细作、合理施肥、改良种子、合理密植等等，十二年全国农业发展纲要所提出的各项增产技术措施，在1956年以来都有了更大范围的推广，到1958年大跃进中，又系统地形成了农业生产的八字宪法。
    农民群众的生产积极性，还带来了农业多种经济的发展，1957年秋后，一般高级社已从单一的农业企业，发展到兼营牧业、渔业、林业、农产加工业和其他副业生产；1958年夏，中央提倡社办工业，以及三社合一之后，许多高级社又兼营了工业、手工业、商业、交通运输和信贷事业；民兵本来就是社员中的积极分子所组成；所以这个时候，许多高级社实际上已经突破了单纯经营农业的范围，而带着农、林、牧、副、渔综合发展，工、农、商、学、兵相互结合的人民公社的性质。于是1958年秋间，便出现了我国劳动人民的伟大创举——比高级社规模更大的、公有化程度更高的、综合性的、政社合一的人民公社。这就充分说明了在1958年大跃进基础上的人民公社运动，是我国革命历史发展的必然产物，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。是生产关系必须适应生产力发展的客观规律的反映。右倾机会主义分子硬说，人民公社“办早了、办糟了”，把亿万群众的革命创举诬蔑为“小资产阶级狂热性运动”，这不仅是闭着眼睛说瞎话，而主要是他们敌视群众运动的资产阶级立场的具体表现。
    五、高举人民公社的红旗，为实现农业现代化继续奋勇前进
    人民公社这个初升的太阳，在短短的一年中，已显示出比原来的高级社具有更大的优越性和无限的生命力，人民公社仍然是集体所有制，但它已经包含有若干全民所有制的成分。它已经改变了原来高级社单一的经济组织的性质，而成为包括工、农、商、学、兵的政社合一的社会基层组织。人民公社的规模也比原来的高级社大得多，一个公社平均等于近三十个高级社。因之，人民公社可以在更大范围内和更大规模上更加科学地组织人力、更加合理地利用土地、物力和财力，使农、林、牧、副、渔一齐发展，工、农、商、学、兵共同跃进；可以大办农村工业，使工、农业同时并举，加速农村工业化；可以促进农业耕作技术的改革，可以在更大的范围内，更便利地组织人力、物力、技术等等方面的分工和协作，加强对自然灾害斗争的威力；可以更快地扩大公共积累，保证不断地扩大再生产；便于实行农业机械化和电气化；可以较快地发展农村文化福利事业，并且在各种集体的活动中，培养社员多方面的知识，使劳动和教育相结合；体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，因此，人民公社是加速社会主义建设的最好形式。我们已经依靠人民公社取得了去年工、农业生产的大跃进和今年的夏季丰收，在今年秋季对空前的自然灾害的斗争中也已经取得了决定性的胜利。今后只要我们坚决执行党的社会主义建设总路线，反对右倾，鼓足干劲，人民公社的优越性，也将愈益显著地发挥出来，继续完成今年的跃进计划和提前完成第二个五年计划的指标，是完全可能的。
    目前，我们的农业技术装备还是落后的，根本上改变农业的落后状态，还必须进行农业的技术改造，实现农业的机械化、电气化，在一切可以使用机器的部门和地方，都使用机器操作，那时，农业的生产力又将是一个新的跃进。我们要充分依靠人民公社这个社会组织形式，充分地发挥它的作用，为根本改变农业的落后面貌，加速农业的现代化继续前进。我们有党中央和毛泽东同志的领导，有鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义这条正确的总路线，有广大人民的强烈的革命意志，有经过整顿日趋巩固、优越性不断发挥的人民公社这样最好的社会组织形式。总之，有着比过去好得多的一切条件，我们完全有可能从今冬起掀起一个比1958年更大的跃进，并在较短的时间内，把我国建成为一个有现代化工业、现代化农业的伟大的繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
    我们的胜利是伟大的，我们的前途无限光明。让我们高举人民公社的红旗，坚定地沿着党的社会主义建设总路线，反右倾，鼓干劲，争上游，厉行增产节约，为加速社会主义建设，为实现农业的现代化而奋勇前进。
