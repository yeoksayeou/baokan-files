(Our dispatch from Nanchang, October 27th) Jiangxi's Yushan County conscientiously implements the principle of diligence and thrift in water conservancy. All water conservancy construction sites vigorously run on-site factories, comprehensively carry out technological innovation and high work efficiency movements, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in materials and an average work efficiency of three cubic meters of earth and stone per worker per day, in order to complete this winter and spring's water conservancy construction tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas.

Currently, 50,000 laborers are involved in winter water conservancy construction across the county, and over 100 projects have started comprehensively. A vigorous technological innovation and high work efficiency movement has been launched at various water conservancy construction sites. Average work efficiency has increased from one cubic meter last year to two cubic meters, and is continuing to improve. More than 100 small on-site factories have been established, producing 85,000 various construction tools, 30,000 tool parts, 18,000 catties of homemade explosives, and 200,000 catties of cement, basically achieving self-sufficiency in materials. In addition, more than 5,000 rain hats and 30,000 pairs of straw sandals have been produced for the laborers. Due to the technological innovation and high work efficiency movement, and having solved the difficulty of insufficient materials themselves, the daily progress of water conservancy construction in the county has increased sharply from several thousand cubic meters in the initial stage to 80,000-90,000 cubic meters.

"Three days without rain, a sea of white (drought); three days of rain, a sea of water," is a depiction of the waterlogging and drought disasters in Yushan County in the past. Before liberation, only 50,000 mu of the county's 310,000 mu of paddy fields had some water conservancy facilities. In the past decade, more than 1,200 water conservancy projects of various types have been built, expanding and improving the irrigated area by 280,000 mu, so that the vast majority of paddy fields in the county have water conservancy facilities. On this basis, the Yushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to build four projects with an irrigation area of more than 10,000 mu each, 147 medium and small-sized projects, and expand 70 projects this winter and spring. After the completion of these projects, the irrigated area will be expanded and improved by more than 100,000 mu, achieving the basic elimination of drought and control of flooding in the county.

After the county party committee determined the county's water conservancy construction tasks, the county's 22 communes immediately arranged their own commune's water conservancy construction plans for this winter and spring according to the county's plan, and organized all commune members to discuss and formulate specific measures to achieve the plans. At the beginning of the discussion, some people lacked sufficient confidence in realizing the water conservancy plan. Some people said: Winter and spring repairs are short, and there is little labor force, and there are too many construction tasks! Some people said: There are many projects and few materials. To complete the task, the higher authorities must provide sufficient materials. Through analyzing the current situation and criticizing the above-mentioned erroneous understandings during the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that: there are rich experiences in water conservancy construction over the past decade, a large number of technical personnel have been trained, there is the superior organization of the People's Commune, and there is the support of commune-run industries, which are very favorable conditions for completing the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and spring. At the same time, many people pointed out: Although the winter and spring repairs are not long, and the labor force is insufficient, the problem can be solved as long as the labor force is arranged properly and used rationally, and the experience of organizing high work efficiency competitions and carrying out technological innovation movements in the past is vigorously promoted. Regarding the lack of materials, many people said: To repair water conservancy for ourselves, we must actively and proactively find solutions, and cannot wait to rely on the state. Therefore, they put forward many ways to solve the material problem: give full play to the strength of commune-run industries, run on-site factories, save materials, and so on. After discussion and analysis of the situation, everyone unified their understanding, raised their thinking, and formulated specific measures to achieve the water conservancy construction plan with full confidence, loudly proposing: Basic self-sufficiency in materials, average work efficiency reaching three cubic meters of earth and stone, and striving to complete the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and spring ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas!

As soon as the water conservancy construction discussion meetings of the communes ended, the prelude to large-scale water conservancy construction in the county was immediately unveiled; then, a high work efficiency competition movement comparing speed and quality and a heat wave of technological innovation appeared at various water conservancy construction sites, and work efficiency immediately increased. At the county's largest project, the "July 1st" Reservoir construction site, more than 30,000 laborers formed various professional teams for transportation, mountain opening, blasting, drilling, etc., implementing large-scale corps operations and conducting "double comparison" red flag competitions with each other, comparing quantity and quality, and the average work efficiency quickly increased from one cubic meter to 2.5 cubic meters. At the Sangyuan and "November 11" Reservoir construction sites, 5,000 laborers vigorously engaged in technological innovation, creating and promoting nearly 1,000 local carts and local trains within half a month, building dozens of miles of sliding transportation roads, and erecting overhead transportation roads in the air, enabling on-site transportation to achieve "flying in the sky, running on the ground, sliding on slopes, and transporting on water," and the soil transportation efficiency was increased four times. The laborers at the Wuyang Reservoir construction site changed from digging soil to blasting, using soil saltpeter and sulfur to make explosives, blasting 2,000 cubic meters of soil in one shot, greatly accelerating the progress of construction. While carrying out technological innovation, various construction sites adopted the method of "on-site training, old leading new, learning while doing, and running schools at night" to train hundreds of junior technical personnel, solving the difficulty of insufficient technical strength. The more than ten farmer technicians trained at the Kangtou Village Reservoir construction site can all independently direct construction, and the quality of the projects they direct is good.

With the development of the technological innovation movement, various water conservancy construction sites tried every means to run on-site factories on a large scale, taking materials locally and producing a large number of water conservancy construction materials such as explosives, cement, and tools. Three water conservancy construction sites in Shuangming Commune mobilized the masses to contribute labor and materials, built simple thatched sheds on the construction sites as factory buildings, and set up seven cement plants and explosive plants, digging local "three-in-one soil," sulfur, and soil saltpeter as raw materials, and produced 2,000 catties of explosives and 5,000 catties of cement within half a month. Liudu Commune organized carpenters and blacksmiths from commune-run industrial factories to go to the construction sites, build four on-site tool factories, and use local iron and trees felled during water conservancy construction to manufacture tools such as hoes, local carts, and wooden rollers, solving the difficulty of insufficient tools at the commune's four water conservancy construction sites. At the same time, various water conservancy construction sites tried every means to save materials and widely used substitutes under the principle of ensuring project quality. If there is a shortage of iron hammers, use stones instead; if there is a shortage of culvert pipes, use tile pipes instead; this saves materials, saves funds, and the construction quality is equally good.

    玉山县勤俭修水利
    革新技术工程日进度猛增数倍　大办小型工厂工具器材自给
    本报南昌27日电　江西玉山县认真贯彻执行勤俭办水利的原则，各个水利工地大办工地工厂，全面开展技术革新与高工效运动，力争达到器材自给和每日每工平均工效三个土石方，以提前并超额完成今冬明春的水利兴修任务。
    现在，全县已有五万名民工投入水利冬修，一百多座工程全面开了工。各个水利工地上掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和高工效运动，平均工效已由去年一方跃升到两方，并且正在继续提高；工地上办起了一百多个工地小型工厂，已生产各种施工工具八万五千件、工具零件三万件，制造土炸药一万八千斤、水泥二十万斤，基本做到了器材自给。此外，还为民工生产了五千多顶雨帽和三万多双草鞋。由于开展了技术革新和高工效运动，自己解决了器材不足的困难，全县水利兴修日进度由初期几千方猛增到八、九万方。
    “三天不雨一片白（旱），三天连雨一片水”，是过去玉山县水旱灾的写照。解放前，全县三十一万亩稻田中只有五万亩田有些水利设施。十年中兴建了各种水利工程一千二百多座，扩大与改善灌溉面积二十八万亩，使全县绝大部分稻田都有了水利设施。在这个基础上，中共玉山县委计划今冬明春全县兴建灌溉万亩以上的工程四座中、小型工程一百四十七座，扩建工程七十座。这些工程完工后，将扩大与改善灌溉面积十多万亩，达到全县基本消灭旱灾和控制水灾。
    县委确定了全县的水利兴修任务之后，全县二十二个公社立即根据县的计划安排了本社今冬明春的水利兴修计划，并组织全社社员讨论，制定实现计划的具体措施。讨论开始时，部分人对实现水利计划缺乏足够的信心。有的人说：冬修春修时间短，劳动力又少，兴修任务太多啦！有的人说：工程多，器材少，要完成任务就得要上级给足够的器材。讨论中通过分析当前形势，批判了上述错误认识，一致认为：有十年来兴修水利的丰富经验，已培养了大批技术人员，有人民公社的优越组织，有社办工业的支援，是完成今冬明春水利兴修任务的十分有利的条件。同时许多人指出：冬修春修时间虽然不长，劳动力虽然不足，但是只要劳动力安排得当和合理使用，大力推行过去组织高工效竞赛和开展技术革新运动的经验，问题就可以解决。对于器材缺乏的问题，许多人说：修水利为自己，自己就要积极主动想办法，不能等待依靠国家。于是他们提出了许多解决器材问题的办法：充分运用社办工业的力量，自办工地工厂，节约使用器材，等等。经过讨论和分析形势，大家统一了认识，提高了思想，满怀信心地制定了实现水利兴修计划的具体措施，响亮地提出：器材基本自给，平均工效达到三个土石方，力争提前和超额完成今冬明春的水利兴修任务！
    各公社的水利兴修讨论会一结束，全县大修水利的序幕随即揭开；接着各个水利工地上就出现了比速度、赛质量的高工效竞赛运动和大闹技术革新的热潮，工效立即上升。在全县最大的工程“七一”水库工地上，三万多名民工组成运输、开山、放炮、打眼等各种专业队伍，实行大兵团作战，相互开展比数量、比质量的“双比”红旗竞赛，平均工效迅速由一方提高到二点五方。桑园、“十一”等水库工地上，五千名民工大闹技术革新，半月内创造与推广了近千辆土车子、土火车，修建了数十里长的滑运道，并在空中架起高空运输道，使工地运输实现了“天上飞、地下跑、斜坡滑、水上运”，运土效率提高了四倍。武阳水库工地上的民工变挖土为爆破，利用土硝、硫磺制炸药，一炮破土两千公方，大大加快了兴修进度。在开展技术革新的同时，各工地采取“工地练兵、以老带新、边学边干、夜间办学”的办法，训练了数百名初级技术人员，解决了技术力量不足的困难。康头村水库工地训练的十多名农民技术员，已经都能独立指挥施工，而且指挥施工的工程质量良好。
    随着技术革新运动的开展，各个水利工地千方百计大办工地工厂，就地取材，大量生产炸药、水泥、工具等水利建设器材。双明公社三个水利工地发动群众献工献料，在工地上搭起简单的茅棚做厂房，办起七个水泥厂和炸药厂，就地挖取“三合土”、硫磺、土硝做原料，半个月内就生产了两千斤炸药和五千斤水泥。六都公社组织社办工业工厂的木工、铁工上工地，建起四个工地工具工厂，利用土铁和修水利中砍倒的树木制造锄头、土车子、木滚子等工具，解决了全社四个水利工地工具不足的困难。与此同时，各水利工地想方设法节约使用器材，在保证工程质量的原则下广泛采用代用品。缺铁锤，用石块代替；缺涵管，用瓦器管代替；这样既省器材，又省资金，施工质量又同样好。
