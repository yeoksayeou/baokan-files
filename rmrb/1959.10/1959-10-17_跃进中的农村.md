　　The Leaping Rural Villages
　　By our correspondents Qu Jitiao and Li Cheng
　　Nikola Ganshev, the Party Secretary of the Lenin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Plevna region, leaned over and skillfully opened the sluice gate of the Marina Reservoir. The water rushed out and flowed into the green fields. Then, Ganshev turned around and said enthusiastically to the visiting guests: "Look, this is the achievement of our Lenin Agricultural Cooperative's Great Leap Forward…."
　　Since the October and November Plenums of the Bulgarian Communist Party last year, the working people of Bulgaria have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, launching a vigorous Great Leap Forward in the national economy. "Complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years!" This inspiring slogan has resounded throughout the country. To date, in less than a year, the heroic labor of the Bulgarian working people has created amazing miracles. We have once again witnessed this miracle in this ordinary agricultural cooperative in northern Bulgaria.
　　The Lenin Agricultural Production Cooperative was formed last year by the merger of four cooperatives, with a total of 2,060 households and 7,000 people. We visited here in early December last year. At that time, the Marina Reservoir, which could irrigate about 600 decares (each decare is equivalent to 1.5 Chinese mu), had just started construction. Now, it can use its stored water to nourish the land. Ganshev told us that in addition to this reservoir, the members also built 25 kilometers of canals and four pumping stations with 11 pumps last winter and this spring, braving the severe cold. Now, this agricultural cooperative, which had no irrigated land a few years ago, has leaped to have about 13,800 decares of irrigated land. The hard work of the members in building water conservancy projects has not been in vain. Although there was a severe drought this year, the average wheat yield per decare reached 171 kilograms due to deep plowing, increased fertilizer application, and other measures. The average yield per decare of 200 decares of irrigated wheat land was as high as 380 kilograms, an increase of more than 100 kilograms over last year. Irrigated corn, cotton, and other crops are also growing very vigorously. It is estimated that the average yield per decare will be 500 kilograms of corn and 140 kilograms of seed cotton. In addition to grains, this agricultural cooperative also grows sunflowers, sugar beets, grapes, vegetables, and other crops. According to the growth of these crops, it is estimated that the yield per unit area will greatly exceed last year. Last year, the average yield per decare of sunflowers was 157 kilograms, and this year it is estimated to be 220 kilograms, with irrigated land expected to yield 280 kilograms. Last year, the average yield per decare of sugar beets was more than 1,600 kilograms, and this year it is expected to be 4,000 kilograms, with irrigated land expected to yield about 6,000 kilograms.
　　When talking about the main reasons for the increase in crop production, the leaders of the agricultural cooperative said that increasing fertilizer application and expanding the cultivated land area are very important conditions. Since last winter and this spring, the members have turned waste land, barren land, and open spaces by riversides, ditches, hillsides, houses, and courtyards into cultivated land, greatly increasing the cultivated land area. This year, in addition to applying chemical fertilizers, the agricultural cooperative also applied about 4,500 tons of farmyard manure.
　　The Great Leap Forward in pig and chicken farming and the sharp increase in the number of sheep in this cooperative also aroused great interest among the guests. While visiting the pig and chicken farms, the hosts introduced that the pig farm now has more than 6,500 pigs, while last year there were only about 2,000. It is planned to supply the state with more than 500 tons of pork, more than double the amount last year. Originally, it was planned to raise 50,000 chickens by the end of this year, but this number has already been exceeded, reaching more than 57,700, while last year there were only more than 6,000. The number of sheep has also increased by nearly double compared to last year, reaching 12,596.
　　In the Great Leap Forward in production, the members looked for tricks, tapped potential, and tried every means to increase the income of the agricultural cooperative. The cooperative operates many sideline projects, including transportation, brick and tile making, willow basket weaving, canning factories for processing tomatoes, peppers, and grapes, and wineries. This year, the cooperative's sideline income will increase three times compared to last year. So far, the income from sideline occupations is almost equivalent to twice that of last year. Ganshev, the Party Secretary of the agricultural cooperative, and Petlaki Boykov, the Vice-Chairman, gave us a detailed calculation of the increase in the cooperative's total income this year: last year, the total income of the cooperative was 21,521,000 leva (Bulgarian currency), and this year it is expected to double this figure, with income from crops reaching 31 million leva, livestock——8.2 million leva, and sideline occupations——2 million leva. They affirmed that, according to the Great Leap Forward situation to date, the Great Leap Forward plan for the cooperative's income growth this year can be achieved with effort.
　　The economic leap forward of the Lenin Agricultural Production Cooperative has not been smooth sailing, but has gone through many tortuous ideological struggles. The construction process of the Marina Reservoir is one such example.
　　A small river used to flow through the village, and for thousands of years, it had flowed by in vain. After the economic leap forward movement began, the Party and agricultural cooperative leaders proposed to build an earth dam on this river to block the river water and irrigate the crops. Building an earth dam was the first time in this area, so there were many objections. Some even said that building an earth dam would not only fail to irrigate the fields, but also cause the earth dam to collapse and cause disasters when the river rose; it was believed that building this kind of reservoir to irrigate the land was a dream. Although the Party and administrative organizations of the agricultural cooperative and engineering technicians patiently explained and publicized, the members, especially the elderly members, participated in the construction project with a skeptical attitude.
　　The reservoir was built, the fields were irrigated, crop production increased, livestock and sideline occupations developed greatly, and income increased. Thus, the skeptical members became active promoters of the Great Leap Forward. Two old members who had firmly believed that an earth dam reservoir could not be built—50-year-old Bilo Yadanski and 55-year-old Baurdan Milev—now tell everyone they meet: We must listen to the Party. If the Party says build a reservoir, then a reservoir will be built... With the leadership of the Communist Party, there is absolutely no problem with the Great Leap Forward, it can be realized....
　　The words of the two old men, Yadanski and Milev, are correct. The reason why the economic leap forward of the Lenin Agricultural Production Cooperative has achieved such great achievements lies in the fact that the Communist Party members and leading cadres of the agricultural cooperative took the lead in labor and their spirit of not fearing difficulties. Since last winter and this spring, when going to the fields in the severe cold to build reservoirs, dams, dig canals, and open up open spaces, the Party members have always been at the forefront.
　　During the irrigation season this spring, when the snow melted and the water rose, one day, about two meters of the embankment of a pumping station was washed away. If the gap was not blocked immediately, it would affect the timely irrigation of 6,000 decares of cultivated land, reduce the harvest, and reduce the income of the agricultural cooperative. At this critical moment, the Vice-Chairman of the agricultural cooperative, Party member Maksim Yankov, and the Party Branch Secretary of the agricultural cooperative, Petko Guchev, passed by here. After seeing this scene, they immediately took off their clothes and jumped into the water, ignoring the cold weather and water, carrying stones and transporting soil to block the gap. At the same time, they greeted the members who were working in the nearby fields. More than a dozen members nearby heard the sound and rushed to participate in the labor of repairing the embankment. Later, the number of people working in the water increased to more than 200. The members blocked the gap in the dam in time, ensuring the smooth progress of the irrigation work. Whenever this matter is mentioned, the members praise Yankov and Guchev as good examples of safeguarding collective interests.
　　The participation of the Party and administrative leading cadres of the agricultural cooperative in physical labor has been praised by the members. The leaders of the agricultural cooperative, such as the Chairman and the Party Secretary, have all participated in 30 days of voluntary labor this year—making bricks and tiles. Ganshev said that the five leaders of the cooperative made a total of 55,000 bricks in 25 working days. While watching the cadres work, the elderly members said happily: "They can lead and work, they are really good...."

　　跃进中的农村
　　本报记者　曲季涛　李成
    普利文州列宁农业生产合作社党委书记尼古拉·甘谢夫探下身去，熟练地打开了水库闸门，玛琳纳水库的水就冲出闸门，顺着渠道滚滚流向一片葱绿的田野。这时，甘谢夫转过身来，兴致勃勃地对来访的客人们说：“呶，你们看，这就是我们列宁农业社跃进的成就……。”
    自从去年保加利亚共产党十月和十一月全会后，保加利亚全国劳动人民热烈地响应了党的号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈的国民经济跃进运动，“三、四年完成第三个五年计划！”这个振奋人心的口号响彻全国。到现在为止，仅仅经过了不到一年的时间，保加利亚劳动人民的英雄劳动已创造出了惊人的奇迹。我们在保加利亚北部这个普通的农业社里再一次亲眼看到了这个奇迹。
    列宁农业生产合作社是在去年由四个社合并而成的，共有二千零六十户，七千人。去年12月初，我们曾到这里来过。那时，这个能浇地六百狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合我国一亩半）左右的玛琳纳水库才刚刚动工兴建，而现在，它已经能用它的积水来滋润大地了。甘谢夫告诉我们，除这个水库外，社员们在去冬今春还冒着严寒，修成了二十五公里长的水渠和拥有十一部抽水机的四个抽水站。现在这个几年前还没有水浇地的农业社，一跃而拥有约一万三千八百狄卡尔水浇地了。社员们兴修水利的辛勤劳动并没有白费，今年虽然遇到了大旱灾，但是由于深耕、多施肥料等措施，平均每狄卡尔小麦产量达到了一百七十一公斤。而二百狄卡尔水浇小麦地平均每狄卡尔的产量高达三百八十公斤，比去年增加了一百公斤以上。水浇过的玉米、棉花等作物也生长得非常茁壮，估计平均每狄卡尔可收五百公斤玉米、一百四十公斤籽棉。除了谷物以外，这个农业社还种有向日葵、甜菜、葡萄、蔬菜等作物。根据这些作物的生长情况估计，单位面积产量都将大大超过去年。去年平均每狄卡尔向日葵收了一百五十七公斤，今年估计能收二百二十公斤，水浇地可望收二百八十公斤。去年平均每狄卡尔甜菜收了一千六百多公斤，今年预计能收四千公斤，水浇地可望收六千公斤左右。
    谈到农作物增产的主要原因时，农业社的领导人说，增施肥料和扩大耕地面积是一个很重要的条件。去冬今春以来，社员们已把河边、沟沿、
  山坡、宅旁、院旁等处的废地、荒地和空地变成了耕地，大大增加了耕地面积。今年，农业社除了施化肥外，还施了约四千五百吨厩肥。
    这个社养猪、养鸡业的跃进和羊的头数的猛增，同样引起客人们的很大兴趣。在养猪和养鸡场参观时，主人介绍说，现在猪场共养猪六千五百多头，而去年只有二千头左右，计划供给国家的猪肉将达五百多吨，比去年增加两倍多。原来计划到今年年底要养五万只鸡，可是现在就已超过这一数字，达到五万七千七百多只，而去年却只有六千多只。羊的头数也比去年增加近一倍，达一万二千五百九十六头。
    在生产跃进中，社员们找窍门、挖潜力，千方百计增加农业社的收入。这个社经营的副业项目很多，包括搞运输、烧砖瓦、编柳条筐子，加工西红柿、辣椒、葡萄的罐头工场和酿酒场等。今年全社的副业收入将比去年增加三倍。到目前为止，副业的收入已几乎相当于去年的两倍。这个农业社的党委书记甘谢夫和副主席别特拉基·波伊柯夫详细地给我们计算了今年全社收入的增加情况：去年全社总收入为二千一百五十二万一千列弗（保币），今年预计将这一数字增加一倍，其中由农作物获得的收入将达三千一百万列弗，畜牧业——八百二十万列弗，副业——二百万列弗。他们肯定地说，根据到目前为止的跃进情况来看，经过努力，今年全社收入增长的跃进计划是可以实现的。
    列宁农业生产合作社的经济跃进并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过了许多曲折的思想斗争过程。玛琳纳水库的修筑过程就是这种事例中的一个。
    村子附近原来有一条小河流过，千百年来，它就是那样白白地流过去了。经济跃进运动开始后，党和农业社领导提出要在这条河上修筑一条土坝，挡住河水，浇灌庄稼。修土坝，在这一带还是第一次，因此异议纷纷，有的甚至说，修土坝不但不能浇田，反而会在小河涨水时，冲垮土坝，酿成灾害；认为修这种水库浇地是梦想。虽然经过农业社党和行政组织及工程技术人员耐心的宣传解释，社员们，特别是年老的社员们，怀着将信将疑的心情参加了修建工程。
    水库修成了，田园得到了灌溉，农作物增产了，畜牧业和副业大发展，收入增加了，于是将信将疑的社员变成了跃进的积极宣传员。曾经坚决不相信能修成土坝水库的两个老社员——五十岁的比洛·雅丹斯基和五十五岁的包尔丹·米列夫，现在逢人就说：一定要听党的话，党说修水库，就修成个水库……，有共产党的领导，跃进绝没问题，能实现……。
    雅丹斯基和米列夫两位老人的话是对的。列宁农业生产合作社经济跃进之所以能取得这样大的成就，在于农业社的共产党员和领导干部带头劳动和他们的不怕艰难困苦的精神。去冬今春以来，在严寒里到田野去修水库，筑水坝，挖水渠，开空地，党员总是走在最前边。
    今春正当浇水时节，雪化水涨，有一天，一个抽水站的堤坝被冲坏了两米左右，假若不马上堵住缺口，就会影响到六千狄卡尔的耕地不能及时浇水，减少收成，减少农业社收入。正在这紧要时刻，农业社副主席、党员玛克西姆·扬科夫和农业社的一个党支部书记别特科·古切夫从这里经过，他们看到这种情景后，不顾天寒水冷，马上脱掉衣服，跳入水中，搬石运土堵缺口，同时，他们向正在附近田间劳动的社员们招呼。附近的十几个社员闻声赶来，一起投入修补堤坝劳动。后来在水中工作的人数增加到了二百多人。社员们及时地堵住了水坝的缺口，保证了浇水工作顺利进行。每当谈起这件事时，社员们都同声称颂扬科夫和古切夫是维护集体利益的好榜样。
    农业社党和行政领导干部参加体力劳动，得到了社员们的好评。农业社主席、党委书记等领导人今年都已参加过三十天义务劳动——烧砖瓦。甘谢夫说，社里五个领导人在二十五个劳动日里共烧了五万五千块砖。年老的社员们一边看干部们劳动，一边乐呵呵地说：“又能领导，又能劳动，真是好样的……。”
