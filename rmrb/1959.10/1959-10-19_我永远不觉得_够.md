I Never Feel "Enough"
　　Wang Lao Jiu

　　I am sixty-six years old this year, and I've lived almost my entire life, but only these ten years since liberation can be considered as truly living like a human being.

　　People call me a "peasant poet," and everyone knows there's a Wang Lao Jiu in Shaanxi Province. But in the old society, my heart would clench whenever someone called me "Lao Jiu." I clearly had an official name, "Jianlu," but just because I was poor, my name wasn't worth anything, and no one called me that. Now that we've turned over, my name is fragrant too. It's not that the name itself is good or bad, it's mainly because people are truly living like human beings, living with value. Now, when I hear people call me "Wang Lao Jiu," I actually feel very honored.

　　"Through Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing, no peasant ever left a poetic name. With the Chinese Communist Party, peasant poets are as numerous as the stars." Just think about it, for thousands of years we peasants were trampled underfoot, but now we also have poets, and produced "scholars." What a great change this is. I only learned to write a few rhymes, and I'm already called a "peasant poet," which is a great honor.

　　In these days of national jubilation, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, I don't want to dwell too much on the suffering in the old society. Anyway, two societies, two different experiences; without the Communist Party, without the new society, there would be no poetry from me either. If there hadn't been liberation, someone like me wouldn't have been able to live to this day, I probably would have died eight years ago. In the old society, I loved to compose clappers, but I couldn't write, so I memorized everything in my head. Back then it was: "Words in my mouth I feared to impart, composed clappers to keep in my heart." Seeing the darkness of society and the oppression of the poor, I felt injustice in my heart, so I composed clappers to sing to the masses during the slack season, to relieve the frustration in my stomach. Who knew that the big bully "Xiangqiao King" Qin Songcheng found out I could compose clappers? Once, he was celebrating his nephew's "full moon," and wanted me to perform clappers to congratulate him. I had hated this guy for a long time, so I pretended to be sick and didn't go. This guy held a grudge, and later, under the pretext of urging payment of grain taxes, beat me with a pole until I slept for half a month. I was so angry and resentful, lying in bed, thinking in my heart and composing in my mouth, and I compiled a long clapper about Qin Songcheng's evil deeds from beginning to end. I didn't dare to speak the clapper, I just kept it bottled up inside. I thought, people often say: a clay pot will inevitably break at the well, and a red flower will only bloom for a hundred days before it withers. Let's see how ferocious Qin Songcheng can be for a few days. One day, when the world turns upside down, I will always speak my clapper and let everyone know your sins. Sure enough, in the spring of 1949, a clap of thunder resounded in the sky, the Communist Party came to Guanzhong, red flags were planted along the mountains, rivers, and waterways, and the sun rose in the middle of the night. Qin Songcheng tucked his tail between his legs and scurried into the southern mountains. On October 20 of that year, at the conference in Xiangqiao to struggle against the local tyrant Qin Shijian (Qin Songcheng's older brother), I went on stage and spoke my clapper, poured out my grievances, and felt a weight lifted from my chest. From that day on, my clapper finally came out into the open.

　　In October 1950, the government arrested Qin Songcheng and executed him in Xiangqiao, which finally removed the big lump in my stomach. I was so happy, my mind became clear, and my clapper, like wheat sprouting, became more and more abundant every day. The Party was very concerned about me, sending people to help and cultivate me, to visit and learn, to hold meetings and discussions, and giving me many opportunities to study. Truly: an old horse sheds its hair and becomes a dragon, a rusty antique shines brightly. I felt that I was getting younger and younger, and composing with more and more energy. The new society has many new things, and everything cannot be separated from the Party and Chairman Mao. Without the Party, there would be no Wang Lao Jiu, and I wrote those poems praising the Party and Chairman Mao with tears in my eyes.

　　Only being able to compose with my mouth and not being able to write was my greatest distress. I thought, we have turned over, and our culture must also turn over. In the old society, we were too poor to afford school, but in the new society, there are conditions, so why not learn? If you never climb the mountain, you'll always say you can't climb it. With the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as we work hard, there is no sesame stalk that cannot be broken open. So in 1952, when I was fifty-eight years old, I finally decided to learn culture. During the day I labored, and at night I studied characters. My wife complained that I was burning the midnight oil, saying, "You're almost sixty years old, what else do you want to do?" I said, "I don't want to do anything else, I just want to recognize a few characters so that writing won't be so difficult." So, learning and writing, recognizing and practicing, I was able to slowly read books and newspapers, and I could also scribble a few strokes with a pen. Knowing how to read was like adding wings to me, I wrote more and faster. As Comrade Ke Zhongping praised in those few lines of poetry: "What a good poet Wang Lao Jiu, labor and poetry in one hand, waving red flags along the Yellow River, speaking, singing, flying, and walking..." My wife used to hate me writing, but now she also supports me. If she doesn't see me writing sometimes, she urges me, saying, "If you're idle, write more, publish more in the newspapers, it's also an honor for our whole family." In the past, I composed clappers just for fun and excitement, but after liberation, under the education and cultivation of the Party, I understood that writing poetry and making propaganda is also revolution. My pen is my weapon, attacking bad people, praising good people, singing about the new society, and defending socialism, which is my responsibility.

　　Some people see my poems published in books and newspapers, and I also went to Beijing to attend meetings and visit, and met Chairman Mao, and they all envied me, saying, "Lao Jiu, you're just a peasant, you've had enough even if you die." I said, I've just started living like a human being, how can I die? I want to live for another twenty or thirty years, I want to live to see communism. If I don't see communism, I will never feel "enough."

　　This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, and it is also the tenth anniversary of my truly being a human being. In just ten short years, the face of the motherland is truly vibrant and prosperous. Now, everyone is opposing Rightist tendencies and boosting their spirits, and various undertakings are leaping forward. I also want to leap forward again and again, adding more effort, studying diligently, improving my thinking, composing and writing more, never dying or dropping my pen, and always being a faithful people's propagandist, singing for the Party and the motherland!

### 我永远不觉得“够”
王老九

专栏：我这十年来

　　我永远不觉得“够”
　　王老九
    我今年六十六岁，活了快一辈子，只有解放后这十年，才算活成了人。
    人们都称我“农民诗人”，都知道陕西省有个王老九，可是在旧社会，一听人喊我“老九”，心里就有气。咱明明有个官名叫“建禄”，就因为咱人穷，名字也不值钱，没人叫。如今咱人翻了身，名字也香了。这不是名字有好坏，主要是人真正活成了人，活得有了价值。现在听人唤我“王老九”，我倒觉得很光荣。
    “周秦汉唐元明清，未见农民留诗名，中国有了共产党，农民诗人多如星。”只要想一想，几千年来咱们被人踩在脚底下的农民，如今也有了诗人，出了“秀才”，这是多么大的变化。我只是学着写了几句顺口溜，就被称作“农民诗人”这是很大的荣誉。
    在咱们这举国欢腾、庆祝建国十周年的大喜庆的日子里，我不愿去多提那旧社会受的苦难。反正两种社会，两种遭遇；没有共产党，没有新社会，也没有我的诗。如果不解放，我这样的人，哪能活到今天，怕早八年都死了。在旧社会，咱就爱编快板，不会写字，全用脑子记。那时是：“嘴里有话怕言传，编下快板记心间。”看到社会黑暗，穷人受压迫，心里不平，就编成快板，农闲时唱给群众听听，消一消肚里的窝囊气。谁知大恶霸“相桥王”秦颂丞知道我能编快板，有一次给他侄子做“满月”，要我去说快板贺喜，我早恨死了这家伙，装病没去。这家伙怀恨在心，后来借着催粮款，用杠子把我打的睡了半月。我气恨不过，睡在床上，心里想口里编，把秦颂丞的恶迹通前到后，编了个长长的快板。快板编成不敢说，只闷在肚子里。我想，人常说：瓦罐不离井口破，花红百日也要落。看他秦颂丞能凶几天，有朝一日，世事翻了过来，我总要把我的快板说出来，让大家知道你的罪恶。果然，1949年春上，一声春雷天空响，关中来了共产党，山川河道插红旗，半夜三更出太阳。秦颂丞狗夹尾巴窜进了南山。那年10月20日，在相桥斗争土豪秦世俭（秦颂丞的哥哥）的大会上，我上台说了我的快板，倒了苦水，肚里轻松了一节子。就从那一天起，我的快板才出头露面了。
    1950年10月，政府把秦颂丞抓回来在相桥枪毙后，这一下才除了我肚里的大疙瘩，心里高兴，脑子也灵了，我的快板，就像麦子破头一样，一天比一天多。党很关心我，派专人帮助和培养我，参观访问，开会讨论，给了我许多学习的机会。真是：老马脱毛变成龙，生锈的古董放光明。我觉得自己越活越年轻，越编越有劲。新社会，新事多，事事都离不了党和毛主席。没有党，就没有我王老九，我是流着热泪写了那些歌颂党和毛主席的诗。
    只能用口编，不能提笔写，这是我最大的苦恼。我想，咱人翻了身，文化也要翻身。旧社会凄惶的上不起学，新社会有条件为啥不学？一辈子不上山，总说山上不去，有了共产党的领导，只要咱努力，没有破不开的芝麻杆。所以1952年，在我五十八岁那年，我才下决心学文化。白天劳动，晚上学字，老伴嫌我熬油，说：“你都快六十岁的人啦，还想咋？”我说：“不想咋，就想认几个字，写作不费难。”就这样，学着写着，认着练着，书报能慢慢看下去了，提笔也能划几个道道了。识了字，就好像给我添了翅膀，写的又多又快，如柯仲平同志夸讲的那几句诗：“好一个诗人王老九，劳动作诗一把手，黄河一带打红旗，说着唱着飞着走……”以前老伴讨厌我写，现在她也支持我了，要是有些时候不见我动笔，她就催着说：“闲了把你?多写些，多登报多宣传，也是咱全家的光荣。”过去编快板，只是为了兴趣，图热闹，解放后在党的教育培养下，我才懂得写诗作宣传，也是革命。我的笔就是武器，打击坏人，表扬好人，歌唱新社会，保卫社会主义，就是我的责任。
    有人看到我的诗出书上报，又上北京开会参观，见了毛主席，都羡慕的说：“老九，你一个农民，死了也够啦。”我说，刚活成人，怎么能死？我还想再活二十年、三十年哩，要活到共产主义去，见不到共产主义，我永远不觉得“够”。
    今年是伟大祖国建国十周年，也是我真正做人的十周年。短短的十年，祖国面貌，真是万紫千红，一片繁荣。现在，人人都在反右倾，鼓干劲，各项事业都在跃进，我也要跃进再跃进，多加一把力，勤学苦练，提高思想，多编多写，不死不丢笔，永远作一个忠实的人民宣传员，为党为祖国歌唱！
