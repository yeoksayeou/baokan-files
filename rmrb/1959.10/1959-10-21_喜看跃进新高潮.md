    Joyfully Witnessing a New High Tide of the Great Leap Forward
    By Our Correspondent Sun Shikai
    The sky had just darkened when the sound of gongs and drums, like popping beans, reached the Yongding Machinery Factory in Beijing. The Communist Youth League Secretary of the Changxindian Communications Factory led a group of heroes who had advanced into 1960's production, holding high their battle pledges to challenge them. A skills competition, "soldier against soldier, general against general," to leap into 1960 commenced. Amidst the enthusiastic applause of thousands, Liu Yajun and Shi Junyu, the renowned high-yield, high-quality heroes from the two factories, met. Addressing each other as "older sister" and "younger sister," they immediately challenged each other to a competition. Liu Yajun, who had already stepped into 1963 production, was determined to fight hard for three months, accomplishing five days' work in three. Shi Junyu also brought out her spirit of completing five months' work in one, vowing to fight hard in the fourth quarter…
    From the day of the auspicious start after the National Day holiday, the resounding battle cry "Catch up with Little Shi, overtake Yajun, fight hard in Red October, and vow to win high yields to leap over 1960" reverberated throughout the Yongding Machinery Factory. The high tide of the Great Leap Forward, which had been underway for two months, thus entered a new stage. When I visited this factory, I saw vitality and enthusiasm everywhere. The "Heroes Who Have Leapt into 1960"榜 (roster) and the pacesetter platforms erected at the factory entrance had been filled with batches of new faces, and new records were being set daily on the pacesetter boards of each workshop and work section. The factory announcers constantly broadcast exhilarating news: The painting team of Workshop 1 took the lead, with the entire team leaping into 1960, resolving to complete the workload of 1961 in the fourth quarter; Workshop 11 clarified its battle direction, focused on production management, and achieved an all-around victory in early October. According to statistics up to the beginning of October, the number of young workers across the factory who had leaped into 1960 production had surged to more than six hundred.
    No one had expected that Shi Junyu, an apprentice who had only been in the factory for a year, would be running ahead of everyone. It was precisely the call of the Party that had inspired everyone. Last year's Great Leap Forward had also tempered everyone. Shi Junyu, a young girl of only sixteen, possessed a fiery heart for the Great Leap Forward. In May, when the factory assigned the task of rushing to produce belt conveyors for mining equipment, she was anxious to see that the work section was unable to complete its quota. She thought, "During last year's Great Leap Forward, as soon as I entered the factory, I saw the master workers displaying a style of daring to think and daring to do, creating new records every day. If I can't complete the task that has fallen on my shoulders this year, it would be too embarrassing. Thinking of the Party's call and encouragement, she dispelled her feelings of inferiority and was filled with energy. At a technical demonstration meeting, she saw Master Zhou Huanyu using an advanced operating method with positioning scales to process bearing seats, producing twice as much per shift as she did. This enlightened her. She thought, "To double production, we must first work skillfully. We must humbly learn and master the advanced experience of the master workers." After returning, she immediately conducted experiments, and production efficiency more than doubled. The production volume for the second and third days continued to increase, completing 262% of the production quota and making it onto the work section's pacesetter platform. Later, with the help of Master Liu Xuemei, she successfully experimented with a manual feed and automatic retraction method, which again doubled production efficiency. Subsequently, many workshops saw the emergence of "High-Yield Teams Catching up with Little Shi" and "Youth Rocket Teams Overtaking Little Shi," and the entire factory quickly became involved in a heated competition.
    Around October, the surging competition movement entered a new peak. From individual leaps, it rapidly moved towards the collective leap of the entire team, entire class, and entire workshop into 1960. Workers in each workshop carefully calculated production details and formulated Great Leap Forward plans to "leap over 1960." At this time, inside and outside the workshops, one could see workers in groups of three or five, finding dispatch orders and using abacuses to calculate each person's actual annual workload, to see if they could complete this year's annual quota ahead of schedule. How much more was needed to leap into 1960?
    Workers automatically formed many "three-helps" mutual aid groups, launching activities where quick workers helped slow workers, experienced workers helped novice workers, and skilled workers helped inexperienced workers. After calculating the figures, the Zhang Yuming production team found that the workload of six apprentices had not yet leaped into 1960. These six young people discussed it and formed a "three-helps" rocket team. When Wang Weicheng, the team member with the worst production efficiency, worked during his shift, many workmates from the previous shift were unwilling to leave after their shift ended, helping him prepare drawings and transport materials. Master Zhang Yuming helped improve the tools and fixtures, personally teaching him the technique of strong cutting. The next day, when Wang Weicheng was working on large shafts, he leaped from machining two shafts per shift to six shafts. This young man also had the confidence to leap into 1960 production. The "one-dragon" competition in Workshop 7 was also lively. Du Hongying, the high-yield, high-quality pacesetter of the entire workshop, heat-treated 175 small shafts on the first day, rising to 251 on the second day, and a few days later leaping to 336 small shafts, breaking the highest record in the history of heat treatment production in this workshop.
    The high tide of the competition surged like a heatwave. Technical innovation flourished, and advanced experiences blossomed everywhere. Many workers, focusing on key production problems, organized skillful attack teams and launched technical revolutions to encircle and suppress key production points. The workers of Workshop 11, having mustered their energy during the National Day holiday, wanted to work hard, but encountered difficulties in trial-producing new products. The new product had strict technical requirements and required specialized tools to ensure quality. However, waiting for the tool workshop to produce the tools before proceeding with production would mean suspending work and waiting for materials for at least a month, which would inevitably affect the overall assembly date of the new product. What should be done? The workshop Party branch convened an emergency meeting and immediately proposed a new battle cry: "Taking advantage of the victory in September, attacking the key issues of new products in October!" The production task was assigned to the teams, and the workers were mobilized to find solutions. The workshop quickly transformed from being quiet and deserted to lively and bustling. Everyone discussed and deliberated, and the ingenious plan they came up with was to adopt the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward and build indigenous tools and equipment themselves. The Party branch supported the masses' suggestions, launching a upsurge of attacking key production points using both indigenous and foreign methods. Workers didn't leave after work; after eating, they automatically returned, and everyone brainstormed to make tools. In less than a week, the entire workshop proposed more than 150 technical innovation projects, large and small. Chen Wencai, the labor model who was famous for making concrete molds for trial-producing tractors during last year's Great Leap Forward, once again showed his skills, rushing to make a reinforcing tool for oil tanks, which increased production efficiency by more than four times. Workshop Director Liu Shouchong, when talking about technical innovation, raised his eyebrows and pointed to the "ding-ding-dang-dang" noisy site outside the window, saying with a smile: "When the mass movement gets going, the climate of the entire factory changes dramatically. Workers can’t even be chased away when they don't finish their work for the day. Now, we're not afraid of any major difficulties in production. The masses automatically find ways to solve them. It’s no longer a matter of leadership simply issuing orders."
    I visited this factory during last year's Great Leap Forward, and this year I see again the excellent situation of continuing the Great Leap Forward here. Although I only stayed for a few days both times, I deeply felt that once the general line of the Great Leap Forward takes root in people's hearts, it will set off sky-high waves and surge forward.

    喜看跃进新高潮
    本报记者　孙世恺
    天刚眼咋黑，爆豆似的锣鼓声传进了北京永定机械厂。长辛店通信工厂的团委书记带领一群提前跨入1960年生产的英雄，高举战表来挑战。一场“兵对兵、将对将”的飞跨1960年的比武竞赛展开了。在上千人的热烈掌声中，两厂著名的高产优质英雄刘雅君和石俊玉会了面。她俩称姐唤妹，当场叫阵比武，提前跨进1963年生产的刘雅君决心大战三个月，三天干完五天活；石俊玉也拿出她一个月完成五个月活的干劲，要奋战四季度。……
    从国庆节后上班开门红这天起，“追小石，赶雅君，大战红十月，誓夺高产跨过1960年”，这个响亮的战斗口号，在永定机械厂里震荡起来了。两个月来的大跃进高潮从此进入新的阶段。当我访问这个工厂时，看见到处是生气勃勃、热气腾腾。厂门口矗立的“跨进1960年的英雄”榜和标兵台上添了成批的新人，各车间各工段的日标兵牌上天天更换新的纪录。工厂广播员不断地播出令人振奋的消息：一车间喷漆组一马当先，全组跨过60年，在第四季度决心完成61年的工作量；十一车间明确战斗方向，大抓生产管理，10月上旬获得满堂红。截至10月初的统计，全厂跨进1960年生产的青年工人猛增到六百多名。
    谁也没有想到进厂刚一年的徒工石俊玉，跑在大家的前面。正是党的号召鼓舞了所有人。去年的大跃进又锤炼了所有的人。石俊玉这个年纪才十六岁的小姑娘，有一颗火热的跃进心。5月间，当厂部交下来赶制矿山设备皮带运输机的生产任务时，她看到工段里完不成定额，心里可急坏了。她想：去年大跃进时，一进厂就看到老师傅们发挥敢想敢干的风格，天天创造新纪录。今年的活落到自己肩上就完不成任务，多丢人。再想到党的号召和鼓励，便打消了自卑心理，浑身充满了干劲。在一次技术表演会上，她看到周焕玉师傅用定位刻度的先进操作方法加工轴承座，每班生产比自己多两倍。这下子可使她的心里开窍了。她想，要生产翻番，首先要巧干，一定得虚心学习、掌握师傅们的先进经验。回去后她马上进行试验，生产效率猛翻了一番多，第二、三天的产量又继续增加，完成了生产定额262％，上了工段的标兵台。后来，在刘雪梅师傅的帮助下，她试验成功了手摇进刀、自动退刀的办法，生产效率又猛翻了一番。接着，许多车间出现了“赶小石高产小组”、“青年火箭跨小石队”，全厂很快卷入热火朝天的竞赛里。
    10月前后，汹涌澎湃的竞赛运动进入新的高峰。由个人飞跃，迅速推向全组、全班、全车间的集体跨进60年的大飞跃。各车间工人大算生产细账，制订“飞跨60年”的跃进计划。这时，在车间内外，到处都可看到工人下班后，三五成群的找出派工单，拿着算盘在计算每个人全年的实际工作量，看是否能提前完成今年全年的定额？还差多少才能跨进60年？
    工人们自动组成了许多“三帮”互助小组，展开快手帮慢手、老手帮新手、熟手帮生手的活动。章玉明生产小组一算账，发现六个徒工的工作量还没跨进1960年。这六个青年商量一下就组成了“三帮”火箭小组。全组生产效率最差的王维成上班干活时，前班许多工友下班都不肯走，帮助他准备图纸、运料，老师傅章玉明帮助改进刀具、卡具，亲手教他强力切削的技术。第二天，王维成做大轴活时，由过去每班车两根一跃提高到六根。这个小伙子也有信心跨进1960年生产了。七车间的“一条龙”竞赛也闹的欢。全车间高产优质标兵杜宏颖小组第一天热处理小轴一百七十五个，第二天上升到二百五十一个，几天后又跃进到三百三十六个小轴，打破了这个车间热处理产量有史以来的最高纪录。
    竞赛的高潮像热浪奔腾。技术革新风起云涌，先进经验遍地开花。许多工人针对生产上的关键问题，纷纷组织巧攻突击队，大闹技术革命围攻生产关键。十一车间职工过国庆节都憋足了干劲想大干一场，偏偏在生产上遇到试制新产品的难关。新产品技术要求严格，必须有专用工具作保证，可是要等工具车间作出工具再生产，非得停工待料个把月不成，这就得眼瞧着影响新产品的总装日期。怎样办呢？车间党支部召开了紧急会议，立刻提出新的战斗口号：“乘9月之胜，攻10月新产品之关。”把生产任务交到小组，放手发动工人想办法。车间里马上由冷冷清清变得热热闹闹。大家谈论来议论去，找出的一条妙计是接受去年大跃进的经验，自己动手大造土工具、土设备。党支部支持群众的建议，掀起了以土洋并举的办法围攻生产关键的热潮。工人们下班也不走，吃过饭又自动回来，大家动脑筋造工具。不到一星期，全车间提出一百五十多项大大小小的技术革新项目。在去年大跃进中试制拖拉机时，用混凝土制成压模而闻名的劳动模范陈文才，这回又大显身手，赶制出油箱压筋工具，把生产效率提高了四倍多。车间主任刘守忠谈起技术革新的事儿，眉毛一扬，手指着窗外“叮叮当当”乱响的现场，笑着说：“群众运动搞起来，全厂的气候就大变，工人们下班时没干完当天的活，你撵都撵不走。现在生产上遇到天大的困难也不怕了，群众就自动找办法去解决，再不是单向领导要办法。”
    在去年大跃进时我曾访问过这个工厂，今年又看到这里继续大跃进的好形势。尽管我两次都只住了暂短的几天，但使我深深感到，总路线大跃进一旦深入人心，那就会掀起拍天浪涛，奔腾向前。（附图片）
