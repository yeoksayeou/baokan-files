　　Connect Short-Distance and Long-Distance Transportation
　　*People's Daily* Commentator

　　Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the call to launch a vigorous mass short-distance transportation campaign, a vast and magnificent upsurge in short-distance transportation is taking shape across the country. Valuable innovations have also begun to emerge on the transportation front in various regions. These innovations have opened up broad avenues for the transportation of materials in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as for the storage and transportation of materials necessary for production and construction this winter and next spring. The "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation of production, transportation, and sales in Changli County, Hebei Province, introduced in this newspaper today, is one that deserves attention.

　　The main content of the "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation of production, transportation, and sales is to use the station as a material distribution center. Through the "six-in-one" joint office of industry, commerce, grain, railway, highway, and transportation departments, the consigning units and long-distance and short-distance transportation, modernized and folk transportation tools, professional transportation departments and mass transportation plans are closely linked. It plans and rationally organizes transportation forces, better connects production and sales departments, guarantees the planning, accuracy, and balance of transportation, thereby accelerating cargo turnover. Short-distance transportation and long-distance transportation are inseparable. Good connection between short-distance and long-distance transportation can create favorable conditions for accelerating cargo turnover. For example, short-distance transportation brings goods to the station in a timely manner, and empty cars can be loaded immediately after arrival. After heavy cars arrive, they are unloaded in a timely manner, which unlocks huge potential for long-distance trunk lines. Conversely, if the combination is not good, it will not only fail to ensure the completion of major trunk line transportation tasks, but also cause wasted labor in short-distance transportation.

　　Organizing "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation is a new topic in organizing transportation work. It is also an art. A lot of work needs to be done to organize it well, but as long as we firmly grasp the soul of "one-dragon" cooperation—establishing communist ideology among employees—all difficulties can be solved. In ancient times, there was a mythical story of "drawing the dragon and dotting the eyes." It said that a painter drew a dragon but did not draw the eyes. When asked why he did not draw the eyes, he said that if the dragon had eyes, it would take off and fly away. If we establish communist ideology, proceed from the overall situation, and possess the communist style of selflessness, putting others before ourselves, and regarding the completion of the other party's tasks as our own, and the other's difficulties as our own, then this dragon is a living dragon with its eyes dotted, and it will be full of vitality and have infinite power. The power of cooperation, when brought into play, is by no means one plus one equals two, but equals three, four, or even more. The experience of the Changli area proves that communist ideology is the foundation for doing a good job in cooperation. If in-depth ideological education is not carried out, and only a few departments are in a joint office together, then even "eight-in-one" or "ten-in-one" will not solve the problem. As some comrades in the transportation department said, even if the desks are moved together, everyone still has their own plans in mind, and perhaps the wrangling will be even more severe. Therefore, when organizing "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation, we must implement political command. Only when politics takes command will "one-dragon" cooperation have a solid ideological foundation.

　　At present, the national economic situation is very good. With the continued leap forward in industry, agriculture, and capital construction, the employees of the transportation departments are shouldering glorious and arduous tasks. In order to complete the national economic plan for the fourth quarter ahead of schedule, and to create conditions for the continued leap forward in the first quarter and the whole year of next year, strengthening transportation work is a very important link. Let us plant the red flag of "one-dragon" cooperation all over the country, from railways to highways, from oceans to inland rivers, from cities to the countryside, so that thousands of "dragons" can take off and fly, making greater contributions to completing this year's plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, and to realizing the glorious task of continued leap forward in the first quarter and the whole year of next year!

　　短途长途衔接起来
　　本报评论员
    党中央和国务院提出了开展轰轰烈烈群众性短途运输运动的号召以后，一个千军万马波澜壮阔的短途运输高潮正在各地形成；各地交通运输战线上也开始出现了一些宝贵的创造；这些创造，为今年四季度的物资运输，以及今冬明春生产建设上必需的物资贮运，打开了广阔的道路。今天本报介绍的河北省昌黎县的产运销“一条龙”大协作，就是值得重视的一个。
    产运销“一条龙”大协作的主要内容，就是以车站为物资集散中心，通过工业、商业、粮食、铁路、公路、搬运六个部门的“六合一”联合办公，将托运单位和长途、短途运输，近代化和民间运输工具，专业运输部门和群众性的运输计划紧密衔接起来；有计划地合理地组织运输力量，把生产和销售等部门更好地联系起来，保证运输的计划性、准确性和均衡性，从而加速货物周转。短途运输和长途运输是密不可分的。短途运输和长途运输衔接得好，就可以为加速货物周转创造良好的条件。比如短途运输把货物及时集中到车站，排空车到达后就可以立即装车；重车到达后，及时卸车，这就为长途干线挖掘出巨大的潜力。相反地，如果结合得不好，那就既不能保证主要干线运输任务的完成，又会造成短途运输的窝工浪费。
    组织“一条龙”大协作，是组织运输工作中的一个新的课题。也是一门艺术。要组织得很好，要做很多工作，但是，只要紧紧掌握住“一条龙”协作的灵魂——在职工中树立共产主义思想，一切困难就可以迎刃而解。古时候流传着“画龙点睛”的神话故事，说是有一个画家画了一条龙，没有画眼睛。别人问他为什么不画眼睛，他说，如果龙有了眼睛，就会腾空飞走。如果我们树立了共产主义思想，一切从全局出发，具有舍己为人、先人后己的共产主义风格，把完成对方的任务看成是自己的任务，把别人的困难当成是自己的困难，那末，这条龙就是点了眼睛的活龙，它就会生气勃勃，力大无穷。协作的力量发挥出来了，决不是一加一等于二，而是等于三、四甚至更多。昌黎地区的经验证明，共产主义思想，是搞好协作的基础。如果不进行深入的思想教育，只是几个部门在一起联合办公，那就是“八合一”“十合一”也不会解决问题；正如运输部门有些同志讲的，把办公桌搬在一起了，心里仍然各有打算，也许扯皮扯得更厉害。因此，在组织“一条龙”大协作时，必须实行政治挂帅。只有政治挂了帅，“一条龙”协作才会有巩固的思想基础。
    目前，全国经济形势十分良好。随着工农业和基本建设的继续跃进，交通运输部门的职工担负着十分光荣而艰巨的任务。为了提前完成第四季度国民经济计划，并且为明年第一季度和全年继续跃进创造条件，加强交通运输工作是一个十分重要的环节。让我们把“一条龙”协作的红旗插遍全国，从铁路到公路，从海洋到内河，从城市到农村，成千上万的“龙”腾空飞舞，为提前十天到半个月完成今年计划，为实现明年第一季度和全年继续跃进的光荣任务作出更大的贡献！
