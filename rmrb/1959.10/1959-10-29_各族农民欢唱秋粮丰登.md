Inner Mongolia: Wheat yield increased by about 30% compared to last year
Xinjiang: Total autumn grain output increased by 20% compared to last year
Ningxia: Total autumn crop output increased by more than 10%
Tibet: Harvests in major agricultural areas increased by 10-20%
Most minority areas have abundant land and sparse populations, and their farming techniques were originally relatively crude. After communization, the People's Communes played a huge superior role in unified production planning and rational allocation of labor, creating more favorable conditions for the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production, and promoting an excellent situation in agriculture in many ethnic minority areas across the country this year.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: A very good situation prevails on the agricultural front in many ethnic minority areas across the country this year. The output of grain crops in most areas has increased by 10% to 20% on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and some areas have increased by about 30%. The farmers of all ethnic groups, celebrating the bumper harvest, are actively preparing for an even greater harvest next year.

After the summer crop harvest in the minority areas of the eleven provinces and autonomous regions across the country, most of the autumn crops have also been harvested. In the vast Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, wheat production this year increased by about 30% compared to last year. Rice, which only began to be planted in large quantities in this area after liberation, has also seen high-yield fields in patches. In Alukeerqin Banner alone, 400 mu of rice yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the total output of more than 9 million mu of autumn grain crops is expected to increase by about 20% compared to last year, with more than 2 million mu of corn yielding more than 500 jin per mu. In the "Jiangnan on the Frontier" of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the total output of more than 5.8 million mu of autumn crops is expected to increase by more than 10% compared to last year, with rice production on more than 800,000 mu increasing by about 40%. The average yield per mu of more than 1 million mu of spring wheat in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province has "crossed the Yellow River," an increase of 23% compared to last year; the more than 680,000 mu of autumn crops that have been harvested have a yield of more than 510 jin per mu, an increase of 29.2% compared to last year. In the Tibetan, Yi, and other minority areas of Sichuan Province, grain crops generally increased by more than 20% compared to last year. In the remote mountainous areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, good news of bumper harvests of mid-season rice is constantly being reported. In Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County, where terraces are stacked upon terraces, more than 70,000 mu of mid-season rice have an average yield of 700 jin per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. This year's harvest in the major agricultural areas of Tibet also increased by 10% to 20% compared to previous years. Tibetan farmers who have freed themselves from the shackles of the serf system are happily harvesting their crops.

Most minority areas have abundant land and sparse populations, and their farming techniques were originally relatively crude. After communization last year, the People's Communes played a huge superior role in unified production planning and rational allocation of labor, creating more favorable conditions for the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production.

This spring, more than 30,000 members of all ethnic groups in Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County, Guangxi, dug more than 28,000 ditches on more than 70,000 mu of terraced fields, turning cold water fields into warm water fields, and achieved a bumper harvest of mid-season rice this year. The members of all ethnic groups in the Baxu Commune of Nandan County are scattered across several mountains. In the past, due to the dispersal of labor, the sowing of mid-season rice often missed the season. This year, the commune unified the allocation of labor and completed the mid-season rice sowing tasks 20 days to a month earlier than in previous years, creating conditions for a bumper harvest. Some ethnic minorities living on the Yunnan border have developed a spirit of cooperation after the establishment of the People's Communes, and spring plowing and planting are generally more than half a month earlier than last year. After the communization of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou, the backward farming methods of "human plowing" and "foot treading fields" were completely changed. Last winter, Qiandongnan organized more than 500,000 people to fight hard for a month using the method of large-scale operations, so that more than 2 million mu of rice fields throughout the state were universally deeply plowed more than eight inches, and more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied per mu, increasing the yield per mu of rice by 27% compared to last year. Some pastoral areas have engaged in agriculture for the first time after communization, achieving complete or partial self-sufficiency in grain. The three pastoral communes in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, achieved a bumper harvest of more than 33,000 mu of grain and oil crops planted this year, and grain can now be completely self-sufficient with a surplus. The harvest in some ethnic minority areas was achieved after overcoming serious natural disasters.

In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, mass movements such as deep plowing of land, accumulation of fertilizer, and construction of water conservancy projects are vigorously unfolding in various ethnic minority areas. (Attached pictures)

    各族农民欢唱秋粮丰登
    内蒙古：小麦产量比去年增长约三成
    新疆：秋粮总产量比去年增长两成
    宁夏：秋季作物总产量增长一成多
    西藏：主要农业区收成增加一二成
    少数民族地区大都地多人少，原来耕作技术比较粗放。公社化后，人民公社在统一筹划生产、合理安排劳动力等方面发挥了巨大优越性，给全面贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”创造了更加优越的条件，促成了全国许多少数民族地区今年农业战线一派大好形势。
    据新华社28日讯　全国许多少数民族地区今年农业战线一派大好形势，绝大部分地区粮食作物产量在去年大跃进的基础上增产一成到两成，有些增产三成左右。喜庆丰收的各族农民正在为明年的更大丰收积极作好准备。
    全国十一个省、自治区的少数民族地区，在夏季作物丰收以后，秋季作物也已大部分收割完毕。在辽阔的内蒙古自治区，今年小麦产量约比去年增长三成左右。水稻是这个地区解放后才开始大量种植的，今年也出现了成片的高产田，仅阿鲁科尔沁旗就有四百亩水稻亩产一千斤以上。新疆维吾尔自治区九百多万亩秋粮作物，总产量预计将比去年增产两成左右，有两百多万亩玉米亩产五百斤以上。在“塞上江南”的宁夏回族自治区，五百八十多万亩秋季作物的总产量预计将比去年增产一成以上，其中八十多万亩水稻增产约四成。甘肃临夏回族自治州一百多万亩春小麦的平均亩产量已经“跨过黄河”，比去年增产23％；已收的六十八万多亩秋季作物，亩产五百一十多斤，比去年增加29.2％。四川省藏族、彝族等少数民族地区，粮食作物一般也都比去年增产两成以上。广西僮族自治区的边远山区不断传出中稻大丰收的喜报，在梯田层叠的龙胜各族自治县，有七万多亩中稻平均亩产七百斤，比去年增产两成以上。西藏各主要农业区今年收成也比往年增加一成到两成以上，摆脱了农奴制度枷锁的西藏农民正在喜气洋洋地收割庄稼。
    少数民族地区大都地多人少，原来耕作技术比较粗放。去年公社化以后，人民公社在统一筹划生产、合理安排劳动力等方面发挥了巨大优越性，给全面贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”创造了更加优越的条件。
    广西边远山区的龙胜各族自治县三万多各族社员，今春在七万多亩梯田上开沟两万八千多条，使冷水田变成暖水田，今年获得了中稻大丰收。南丹县八墟公社各族社员散居在几个山头，过去因为劳动力分散，中稻播种常常抢不上季节；今年公社统一安排劳动力，比往年提前二十天到一个月完成中稻播种任务，为丰收创造了条件。居住在云南边疆的一些少数民族，成立人民公社以后大兴协作之风，春耕栽插普遍比去年提早半个多月。贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州和黔南布依族苗族自治州公社化以后，彻底改变了“人拉犁”和“脚踩田”的落后耕作方法。黔东南去年冬天组织五十多万人，采取大兵团作战的办法苦战一个月，使全州二百多万亩稻田普遍深耕八寸以上，每亩施足底肥两万多斤，今年水稻亩产量比去年提高27％。有些牧业地区在公社化以后第一次经营农业，就作到了粮食全部自给或部分自给。青海省海南藏族自治州的三个牧业公社，今年种植的三万三千多亩粮食和油料作物获得丰收，粮食已可以全部自给而有余。有些少数民族地区的丰收，是在战胜严重自然灾害后取得的。
    为了争取明年更大的丰收，各少数民族地区深翻土地、积肥造肥、兴修水利等的群众运动正在蓬勃展开。（附图片）
