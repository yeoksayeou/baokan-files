Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 15th: The Jakarta local military authorities ordered the "People's Daily" on the 15th to suspend publication temporarily starting from the 16th. The Jakarta local wartime authorities said that this was because the "People's Daily" published news and articles opposing Presidential Decree No. 6 of 1959 regarding the change of the local government system.

The military authorities in South Sumatra banned the distribution of this newspaper in its jurisdiction for the same reason.

Presidential Decree No. 6 was drafted by Ipiq Gandamana, the Minister of Interior and Local Autonomy. This recently published decree by the government changed the heads of local governments, who were previously elected by local councils, to being appointed by the government. Ipiq decided to use this decree to replace the local autonomy decrees that had been implemented since 1957, which were passed by the parliament.

Major parties in Indonesia believe that this decision weakens parliamentary democracy and the role of political parties. Therefore, this decision has been widely opposed. The "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 15th, requesting that the implementation of this decision be delayed and that the Supreme Advisory Council and the Parliament discuss this issue. It is reported that the Supreme Advisory Council is scheduled to discuss this issue on October 20, and many major parties in the Parliament are also preparing to discuss this issue.

　　雅加达和南苏门答腊军事当局
    令印度尼西亚“人民日报”暂时停刊
    新华社雅加达15日电　雅加达地方军事当局在15日命令“人民日报”从16日起暂时停刊。雅加达地方战时掌权者说，这是因为“人民日报”刊载了反对关于改变地方政府制度的1959年第六号总统决定的消息和文章。
    南苏门答腊的军事当局以同样的理由禁止在它辖区内发行这家报纸。
    第六号总统决定是由内政和地方自治部长伊皮克·甘达曼纳拟订的。这个政府最近发表的法令使以前由地方议会选举产生的地方政府首长改由政府任命。伊皮克决定用这个法令来代替1957年以来已经实行的地方自治法令，地方自治法令是由国会通过的。
    印度尼西亚各大党认为，这个决定削弱了议会民主和政党的作用。因此这个决定受到了普遍的反对。“人民日报”15日发表社论，要求延缓实行这个决定，并且等待最高谘询委员会和国会讨论这个问题。据报道，最高谘询委员会预定在10月20日讨论这个问题，同时，国会中许多大党也准备就这个问题进行讨论。
