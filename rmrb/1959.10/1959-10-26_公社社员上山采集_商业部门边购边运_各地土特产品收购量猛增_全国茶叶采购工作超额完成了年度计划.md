Xinhua News Agency Report: While vigorously purchasing major agricultural products such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea, commercial departments in various regions have also made great achievements in the purchase of local specialties. In the third quarter, the total purchase value of local specialties by the national commercial system reached over 800 million yuan, equivalent to 80% of the purchase total in the first half of the year, and more than doubled compared with the same period last year. Most regions overfulfilled their third-quarter purchase plans, and some special districts and counties completed and overfulfilled their annual purchase plans three months ahead of schedule.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, adhering to the spirit of "grasping both the big and the small, giving consideration to both the primary and the secondary," and giving full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, mass shock collection campaigns were launched based on the collection characteristics of various local specialties. This is the foundation for doing a good job in the purchase of local specialties. On September 10, the Yangchang People's Commune in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province, organized more than 4,000 people to collect Chinese gall on the mountains, and purchased more than 60,000 jin of fresh Chinese gall in one day, equivalent to the total purchase volume for the entire last year. Recently, Zhong County in Sichuan Province organized more than 350,000 people to collect on the mountains. As of October 16, it had purchased 26.5 million jin of various wild plant raw materials, an increase of nearly two times compared with the same period last year, and it completed and overfulfilled the annual purchase plan ahead of schedule. In the process of purchasing local specialties, various regions emphasized putting politics in command and strengthening publicity and mobilization work, while implementing the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work.

In order to achieve simultaneous production, purchase, processing, and transportation, commercial departments have strengthened procurement agencies, added purchase points, and adopted a combination of fixed purchase and mobile purchase, as well as a combination of purchasing local specialties and supplying production and living materials, which greatly facilitated the masses to sell their products. Enshi County in Hubei Province adopted the approach of grasping procurement with one hand and transportation with the other. In September alone, it transported more than 1,000 tons of local products and waste products. From July to September, Zhejiang Province transported more than twice as much Mao bamboo as in the first half of the year, supplying the needs of handicrafts, fisheries, and agricultural production in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Henan, and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: This year, the national tea procurement work has continued to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. As of October 15, the national annual tea procurement plan has been overfulfilled, with the quantity increasing by 5.9% compared to last year. Provinces with faster progress, such as Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Jiangsu, have overfulfilled their annual plans by 10% to 60%. The procurement volume in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and other provinces has increased by 20% to 100% compared with the same period last year. Now, procurement departments in various regions are striving to achieve the goal of exceeding the procurement plan by 10% ahead of schedule.

The continued Great Leap Forward in tea this year is the result of the attention and strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels. The provincial Party committees of Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Guizhou provinces personally grasped tea production. Many provinces held tea conferences presided over by provincial Party secretaries and governors. From special districts, counties, and communes to production teams in major tea-producing areas, unified leadership organizations for production, procurement, and transportation were established under the leadership of the Party committee to grasp organization, planning, measures, action, and effectiveness, thereby greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of commune members and significantly improving labor efficiency. The vigorous development of the autumn tea bumper harvest campaign is the key to overfulfilling the tea procurement plan this year. Before the campaign, some people only acted according to historical habits, believing that autumn tea had little oil and water, saying that picking autumn tea required a lot of labor and yielded little income, and it was not cost-effective. Some simply opposed picking autumn tea. Various regions launched free-airing and debate campaigns to address the conservative thinking on picking autumn tea, corrected various right-leaning emotions, and put forward the slogan of "large-scale picking and large-scale cultivation," organizing a large number of laborers to shock-pick autumn tea. While overcoming typhoons and storms in August and September, the Fu'an Special District in Fujian Province immediately launched a "thousand-dan day, ten-thousand-dan week" shock campaign, dispatching 100,000 people to pick and process tea. The unprecedented autumn tea shock campaign created a bumper harvest miracle.

In order to process in a timely manner, various regions, adhering to the principle of walking on two legs with a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, established a large number of new-type, powered tea preliminary processing factories (stations), added a large number of tea-making machines, universally promoted rapid two-handed tea picking, and trained a large number of tea-picking experts. In Anhui, Hunan, Yunnan, Hubei, and other provinces, more than 300,000 people learned to pick tea with both hands, and tea-picking efficiency generally increased by 50% to 100%.

Now, while celebrating this year's harvest, tea-producing areas are immediately launching large-scale winter ploughing and fertilizing work in tea gardens, laying a solid foundation for an even greater harvest next year. (Attached picture)

    公社社员上山采集　商业部门边购边运
    各地土特产品收购量猛增
    全国茶叶采购工作超额完成了年度计划
    新华社讯　各地商业部门在大抓棉、麻、烟、茶等主要农产品收购的同时，土特产品的收购也取得了很大成绩。在第三季度内，全国商业系统土特产收购总额达八亿余元，相当于上半年收购总额的80％，比去年同期增长了一倍以上。大部分地区超额完成了三季度收购计划，有些专区、县提前三个月完成和超额完成全年收购计划。
    在党委的统一领导下，本着“大小都抓，主次兼顾”的精神，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，根据各种土特产采集特点，开展群众性的突击采集运动，是做好土特产品收购工作的基础。贵州省镇远县羊场人民公社9月10日组织了四千余人上山采集五倍子，一天就收购了鲜五倍子六万余斤，相当于去年全年收购总额。最近四川省忠县组织了三十五万余人上山采集，到10月16日止，已收购各种野生植物原料二千六百五十万斤，比去年同期增长近二倍，提前超额完成了全年采购计划。在土特产品的采购过程中，各地强调政治挂帅、加强宣传动员工作，同时贯彻执行按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。
    为了做到边生产、边收购、边加工、边调运，商业部门充实了采购机构，增设了采购点，采取固定收购与流动收购相结合，收购土特产品与供应生产资料和生活资料相结合的方法，大大地便利群众出售。湖北恩施县采取一手抓采购、一手抓运输，仅9月份就运出土产品和废品一千多吨。浙江省7月至9月调出的毛竹比上半年增加了一倍多，供应上海、江苏、河南等地手工业、渔业和农业生产的需要。
    据新华社23日讯　今年全国茶叶采购工作在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。到10月15日为止，全国茶叶年度采购计划已超额完成，数量比去年增长5.9％。进度较快的浙江、贵州、江苏等省已超额完成年度计划的10％到60％，四川、云南、贵州、浙江等省的采购量比去年同期增长了20％到一倍。现在各地采购部门正在力争提前实现超过采购计划10％的目标而奋斗。
    今年茶叶继续实现大跃进，是各级党委重视并加强领导的结果。四川、云南、浙江、安徽、贵州等省省委亲自抓茶叶。许多省都由省委、省长亲自主持召开茶叶会议。各主要茶区从专区、县、公社直到生产队都在党委领导下建立了生产、采购、调运的统一领导机构，抓组织、抓计划、抓措施、抓行动、抓效果，从而大大鼓舞了社员劳动热情，劳动效率显著提高。轰轰烈烈的开展秋茶丰产运动，是今年超额完成茶叶采购计划的关键。运动开展前，有些人只按历史习惯办事，认为秋茶油水不大，说采秋茶花工大，收入少，不合算，有的则干脆反对采秋茶。各地针对采秋茶的保守思想展开鸣放辩论，纠正了种种右倾情绪，同时提出了“大采摘大培育”的口号，组织了大批劳力突击秋茶。福建省福安专区在战胜8、9月台风暴风的同时，紧接着开展“千担日、万担周”的突击运动，出动十万人采茶制茶。规模空前的秋茶突击运动，创造了史无前例的丰产奇迹。
    为了及时加工，各地本着土洋结合两条腿走路的方针，建立大量新型的、使用动力的茶叶初制厂（所），添置了大量制茶机械，普遍推行了双手快速采茶，培养了大批采茶能手，安徽、湖南、云南、湖北等省学会双手采茶的就有三十多万人，采茶工效普遍提高50％到一倍以上。
    现在各茶区在欢庆今年丰收的同时，紧接着展开大规模的茶园冬耕培肥工作，为明年的更大丰收有力地打下基础。（附图片）
