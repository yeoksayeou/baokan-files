    Get Ahead of the Farming Season
    By People's Daily Commentator

    "Based on the characteristics of the agricultural production season, focusing on the needs of agricultural production, getting ahead of the farming season, proactively arranging and producing in advance" is an important experience summarized by the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee's industrial departments in their practice of supporting agricultural production. This experience is a concrete manifestation of local industries implementing the policy of serving agricultural production. It is worth promoting throughout the country.

    Industrial support for agriculture must get ahead of the farming season. This is the only way to comply with the objective laws of agricultural production development. The first characteristic of agricultural production is its long production cycle and early preparation. Crops generally span seasons and years, often being sown in the previous season and harvested in the next, or sown this year and harvested next year. While industrial departments are still busy completing this year's production tasks, agriculture has already begun sowing work for next year's summer crops. The second characteristic is its strong seasonality. Agricultural activities are closely related to the seasons. Sowing and harvesting are timed, and even a day's difference can affect crop yields. If industrial departments want to better serve agricultural production, they must first consider this law when arranging their own production, and arrange and organize production ahead of the farming season. By doing so, they can provide effective support for agricultural production and greatly help farmers not miss the farming season and achieve a bumper harvest. Conversely, if industrial departments violate this law of agricultural production, even with the best of intentions, producing a large number of farm tools out of season will not have the desired effect. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee recently put forward a slogan: Complete industrial support for agriculture one quarter ahead of schedule. This slogan is very timely. It is not only to prepare for the great development of agricultural production this winter and next spring, but also should serve as a long-term guiding ideology for local industrial departments to serve agricultural production. A certain system should be established to make it a routine and adhere to it for a long time.

    The current problem is that some local industrial leadership departments have not paid attention to mastering and applying this law in supporting agriculture. As a result, industrial production sometimes lags behind the farming season, only arranging the production of seeders when agricultural production is sowing, and harvesting and threshing machines are still not installed in factories when harvesting is approaching. Falling behind by one season is equivalent to falling behind by one year, and the loss is great! There are, of course, many reasons for this lag, and a more common idea is that "producing in advance will disrupt the original plans and steps of industrial production." The experience of the Yangzhou Special Zone precisely shows that because they started early and acted quickly, they not only did not disrupt their plans, but also became very proactive, and the production of local industries truly became a powerful assistant to agricultural production. Last winter, they prepared a large number of irrigation and drainage machines for this summer, which strongly supported this year's fight against drought. At the beginning of the third quarter of this year, to date, all kinds of agricultural tools needed for autumn harvest and autumn planting have been prepared, and the mechanization of threshing in Jiangdu, Qingjiang and other counties has reached more than 80%. Now, it is not the season waiting for agricultural tools, but the agricultural tools waiting for the season. Therefore, they gained time and took the initiative, and are now organizing a large number of manpower and material resources to begin planned preparations for agricultural production this winter and next spring.

    Next year's agricultural production will be a situation of continued great leap forward. Whether greater harvests can be achieved depends on whether the industrial departments can provide timely and effective support. The time is now very tight, and all localities must seize the last two and a half months of this year, arrange in advance, and take immediate action, adopt all measures to ensure that the agricultural front achieves greater victories next year.

    赶在农时季节的前面
    本报评论员
    “根据农业生产季节的特点，围绕农业生产的需要，走在农时季节的前面，主动安排，提前生产”，这是扬州地委工业部门在支援农业生产
  的实践中总结出来的一条重要经验，这条经验是地方工业贯彻执行为农业生产服务方针的具体化。值得在全国各地推广。
    工业支援农业，必须走在农时季节的前面，这才能符合农业生产发展的客观规律。农业生产的第一个特点是生产用期长、生产准备早。农作物从种到收一般都要跨季度、跨年度，往往是上一季下种，下一季收获，或者是今年下种，明年收获。当工业部门还在抓紧完成今年的生产任务时，在农业方面，已经开始进行明年夏熟作物的播种工作了。第二个特点是季节性很强。农事活动和天时季节的关系非常密切，播种、收割都有定时，往往由于一日之差，就要影响农作物的收成。工业部门要更好地为农业生产服务，就必须在安排自己的生产时，首先考虑到这个规律，赶在农时季节前面来安排生产，组织生产。做到这一点，就能够给农业生产以有效的支援，可以在很大程度上帮助农民兄弟不误农时，夺得丰收，反之，如果工业部门违反了农业生产的这个规律，即使有再好的愿望，不合农时地生产了大批的农具，也不可能发挥应有的作用。江苏省委最近提出了一个口号：提前一个季度完成工业支援农业的任务。这个口号非常及时，这不仅是为了为今冬明春的农业生产的大发展及早做好准备，而且应该作为地方工业部门为农业生产服务的一个长远的指导思想。应该建立一定的制度，使它成为常规，把它长期地坚持下去。
    目前的问题是有一些地方的工业领导部门，在支援农业方面，还没有注意掌握和运用这个规律。因而工业生产有时就落在农时季节的后面，到农业生产播种时才来安排播种机的生产，到快要收割时，收割和脱粒机还在工厂里安装不出来。落后一个季节，就等于落后一年，这个损失是很大的！造成这种落后现象的原因当然很多，其中有一个较普遍的思想是认为“提前生产会打乱工业生产原来的计划和步骤。”扬州专区的经验，恰恰说明正由于他们动手早，动手快，不仅没有打乱了章法，而且非常主动，地方工业的生产真正成了农业生产的有力的助手。去年冬季他们就为今年夏季准备好了大批的排灌机械，有力地支持了今年的抗旱斗争。今年第三季度一开始，到目前，已经把秋收秋种所需要的各种农具准备就绪，江都、清江等县脱粒机械化已达到80％以上。现在，不是季节等农具，而是让农具等季节了。因此他们获得了时间，争取了主动，现在又组织了大批的人力和物力为今冬明春的农业生产开始了有计划的准备工作。
    明年的农业生产是一个继续大跃进的形势，能不能取得更大的丰收，一个重要环节就看工业部门能不能及时地有效地给予支持，现在时间已经非常紧迫，各地必须抓紧今年的最后两个半月的时间，提早安排，立即动手，采取一切措施，保证明年农业战线取得更大的胜利。
