　　Strive for Overproduction of Timber
    In 1958, the national output of logs exceeded the original planned target for 1962. This year, we have achieved another great victory in the continued Great Leap Forward. However, the current timber production still cannot meet the needs. The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "We must vigorously and closely grasp the production of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, especially the production of iron, steel, steel products, coal, timber, cement, and chemical raw materials, and strive to overfulfill the tasks." To ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in steel, coal, railways, papermaking, and capital construction, this year's national timber production must not only guarantee the completion of the state plan, but also strive for overproduction.
    In 1958, log production increased by 25.56% compared to 1957. With roughly the same production capacity in terms of machinery and equipment, this year's plan is to produce an additional three million cubic meters of logs compared to 1958. Achieving a significant overproduction on this basis is certainly not an easy task. But it is something that can be done. In July, some people were still worried that the timber plan would not be completed, but the timber output in August increased by 10% compared to July. As of the end of September, the national timber production has completed 84.8% of the annual plan, an increase of 29.6% over the same period last year. Eighteen forestry bureaus in Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have successively completed their annual plans, showing a good situation of a Great Leap Forward during the off-season. This is the result of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. Facts have proved that as long as we continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and mobilize the masses to deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is entirely possible to overfulfill this year's timber production tasks.
    Fully mobilizing the masses to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution is the central link to ensure the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Forestry areas should guide the enthusiasm and dedication of the masses towards solving key production issues, create and reform timber transportation tools according to local conditions, and promote all effective new timber collection and transportation tools, such as wooden rail cars, various chutes, and overhead cableways. Due to the promotion of wooden rail slides, wooden chutes, and overhead cableways, the labor productivity of the Tanghe Forestry Bureau in Jilin Province has generally increased by more than double. Timber production urgently needs to reform tools; as long as we mobilize the masses to vigorously reform tools, we will have a reliable guarantee to overfulfill this year's timber production tasks.
    In order to fully utilize the efficiency of transportation machinery and equipment and ensure the over-planned completion of this year's timber production, we must further strengthen the work of machinery and equipment maintenance. The quality of machinery maintenance work has a crucial role in improving timber production efficiency. The proportion of mechanized timber harvesting and transportation in the forestry areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia is relatively high, both around 60%, making it even more necessary to pay attention to the maintenance of machinery and equipment. In addition, while rushing to transport timber, we must also strengthen the preparation for winter transportation.
    The main task of the southern forestry areas at present is to seize the season and actively rush to transport the timber accumulated in the mountains and along the small streams. Some mountain streams can still be used for floating logs, so we must seize the opportunity, race against time, and launch a concentrated effort to release the logs. At the same time, we must also vigorously develop mountain land transportation to transport all the stored timber to the riverside as soon as possible, in order to prepare for the next stage of transportation. As for the timber stored along the highways, forestry departments need to cooperate closely with transportation departments to vigorously carry out short-distance transportation to deliver the timber to the allocation points. Properly arranging labor and organizing large-scale cooperation in timber production is also a very important issue. Although agricultural production is currently quite tense, the labor problem can be solved as long as we make overall arrangements and use labor rationally.
    Comrades on the national timber production front, as well as railway, transportation, and commercial departments, let us muster greater efforts, support and cooperate with each other, and strive to transport the timber down the mountains, support national construction, and overfulfill this year's timber production tasks!

　　力争木材超产
    全国的原木产量，1958年就超过了原定的1962年计划指标，今年又获得了继续跃进的伟大胜利。但是，目前木材的产量还不能满足需要。党的八届八中全会决议中指出：“要大力抓紧原料、材料、燃料、电力的生产，特别是铁、钢、钢材、煤炭、木材、水泥、化工原料的生产，力争超额完成任务”。为了保证钢铁、煤炭、铁路、造纸以及基本建设等方面的继续跃进，今年全国木材生产不但必须保证完成国家计划，而且要力争超产。
    1958年原木生产比1957年提高25.56％；在机械设备等生产能力差不多的情况下，今年计划又比1958年多生产原木三百万立方米，在这个基础上再大大超产，当然不是一件很容易的事情。但这是能够作到的事情。7月份还有人耽心木材计划完不成，而8月份的木材产量比7月份增长了10％。截至九月底，全国木材生产已完成全年计划的84.8％，比去年同期增长29.6％，黑龙江、内蒙古已有十八个林业局先后完成全年计划，出现了淡季跃进的良好形势。这是反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。事实证明，只要继续贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，发动群众深入开展增产节约运动，超额完成今年木材生产任务是完全可能的。
    充分发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，是保证不断提高劳动生产率的中心环节。各林区要把群众的干劲、钻劲引向解决生产上的关键问题，因地制宜地创造与改革运材工具，推广一切行之有效的各种集材、运材新工具，如木轨车、各种滑道和架空索道等。吉林省汤河林业局，由于推广了木轨滑道、木滑槽、架空索道等，劳动生产率普遍提高一倍以上。木材生产迫切需要改革工具；只要发动群众大力改革工具，超额完成今年的木材生产任务就有了可靠的保证。
    为了充分发挥运输机械设备的效能，保证今年木材生产超计划完成，还必须进一步加强机械设备维修的工作。机械维修工作的好坏，对于提高木材生产效率有着极为重要的作用。东北和内蒙古各林区木材采运的机械化比重较大，都在60％左右，更必须注意机械设备的维修工作。此外，在抢运木材的同时，还要加强冬季运输的准备工作。
    南方各林区当前的主要任务是抓紧季节，积极抢运山场和小溪边积存的木材。现在有些山区小溪水还能流送，必须抓紧时机，争分夺秒，突击放运；同时也要大搞山陆运输，以便尽快地把存材全部抢运到大河边，为下一步运输做好准备。至于在公路边的存材，需要林业部门与交通部门密切协作，大搞短途运输，把木材送到调拨地点。在木材生产中妥善安排劳力以及组织大协作，也是一个非常重要的问题。尽管当前农业生产相当紧张，只要统筹安排，合理使用，劳动力问题是可以解决的。
    全国木材生产战线以及铁路、交通、商业等部门职工同志们，鼓起更大干劲，互相支援协作，为把木材抢运下山，支援国家建设，超额完成今年木材生产任务而奋斗！
