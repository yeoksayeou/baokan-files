Today's meeting in Berlin to report successes showed that the vast majority of enterprises in all districts of the country have fulfilled their pledge to complete 80% of the year's production tasks by National Day (October 7th).

According to materials announced at the meeting, 80% of the working people in the country participated in the competition to welcome National Day. Miners at the "Wismut" mining company had completed 82.6% of the year's plan by October 5th. Workers at the Stalin Steel Factory produced 100,000 tons of pig iron in the September battle to seize steel, creating the highest record since the factory was established. The Schwerin district in the agricultural region has made great achievements in the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, summarized after the representatives of the districts reported their successes, saying that the fact that 80% of the working people in the country participated in the competition to welcome National Day vividly shows that the people of the whole country feel that they belong to the big family of the first German peaceful country and socialist builders.

Ulbricht called on all working people to master advanced science and technology. He said that in this regard, we should learn from the Soviet people and the Chinese people, and learn from their example of constantly striving to improve themselves. Everyone, from ministers to workers, must study in order to achieve the complete victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic at the predetermined speed.
