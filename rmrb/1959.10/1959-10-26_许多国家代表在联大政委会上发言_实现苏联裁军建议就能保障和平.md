Xinhua News Agency, October 24th dispatch, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament on the 16th, 19th, 22nd, and 23rd. Representatives from many countries, in their speeches, supported and welcomed this positive and significant proposal from the Soviet Union. However, some representatives also expressed doubts about it and attempted to diminish its significance.

Albanian Foreign Minister Shtylla emphasized that adopting this proposal would mark a turning point in human history. Only by achieving complete and thorough disarmament can the danger of new wars be avoided.

Romanian delegation head Brucan pointed out that the fundamental significance of the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament lies in its timely appeal to all countries to halt the harmful arms race.

Ukrainian representative Palamarchuk stressed that complete and thorough disarmament is so concrete and urgent that we have no right to obstruct and complicate it with various suggestions.

Cambodian Foreign Minister Song Shuang stated that the Cambodian government would welcome the conclusion of a disarmament agreement. He called on all countries to treat the Soviet disarmament proposal positively.

Liberian representative Cooper believed that the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament aims to realize humanity's long-standing ideal.

Greek representative Christian Palamas said that the Soviet disarmament proposal is a very important proposal and deserves serious study. He said that the Greek delegation does not agree with the claim that the Soviet proposal is merely propaganda.

Cuban representative Manuel Bisbe pointed out that the Soviet plan is a good idea.

Guinean representative Diallo stated in his speech that his country supports all measures for the rapid achievement of complete disarmament.

British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ormsby-Gore, in his speech, expressed his willingness to seriously study the Soviet proposal.

French representative Jules Moch put forward a plan with great one-sidedness, attempting to prevent the disarmament issue from being practically resolved. Moch insisted that disarmament should begin with the prohibition of satellites, rockets, submarines, long-range bombers, and aircraft carriers, as well as the elimination of rocket weapon launch sites.

    许多国家代表在联大政委会上发言
    实现苏联裁军建议就能保障和平
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会16、19、22、23日继续讨论苏联政府提出的全面、彻底的裁军建议。许多国家的代表在发言中支持和欢迎苏联这个积极的、具有重大意义的建议。同时也有些代表对它散布怀疑和企图贬低它的意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部长什图拉强调指出，采纳这个建议将标志着人类历史的转折点。只有实现全面彻底裁军，才能避免新战争的危险。
    罗马尼亚代表团团长布鲁坎指出，苏联的全面彻底裁军建议的基本意义在于，它是为停止有害的军备竞赛而向各国发出的及时的号召。
    乌克兰代表帕拉马尔楚克着重指出，全面彻底的裁军是这样的具体和迫切，我们没有权利用各种建议来阻挠和使它复杂化。
    柬埔寨外交大臣宋双说，柬埔寨政府将欢迎达成裁军协议。他呼吁所有的国家积极对待苏联的裁军建议。
    利比里亚代表库柏认为，苏联的全面和彻底裁军建议目的是实现人类多年来的理想。
    希腊代表克里斯蒂安·帕拉马斯说，苏联的裁军建议是一项十分重要的建议，值得认真研究。他说，希腊代表团不同意说什么苏联建议是一种宣传。
    古巴代表曼努埃尔·比斯维指出，苏联的计划是一个好主张。
    几内亚代表迪亚洛在发言中表示，他的国家支持迅速达成全面裁军的一切措施。
    英国协办外交事务国务大臣奥姆斯比—戈尔在发言中，表示准备认真研究苏联的建议。
    法国代表儒勒·莫克提出了一个带有极大片面性的计划，企图使裁军问题不能得到实际解决。莫克硬说，裁军应当从禁止卫星、火箭、潜水艇、远程轰炸机和航空母舰以及取消火箭武器发射场开始。
