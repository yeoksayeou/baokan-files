Adhere to the General Line and Continuously Leap Forward
	Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee Sums Up Experiences and Lessons, Proposes Goals

	(Reported by this newspaper) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from August 25th to September 27th. The meeting listened to Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, convey the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and earnestly studied and discussed the various resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, unanimously expressing their support. The meeting cited a large number of facts and criticized the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres in the Autonomous Region. Through this meeting, all the comrades present further strengthened their class stance and improved their ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to identify the direction of the wind.

	The meeting analyzed the situation in the Autonomous Region and unanimously agreed that, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the Autonomous Region Party Committee's resolute implementation of the Party's General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the national economy of the Autonomous Region had achieved rapid development. In 1959, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the Autonomous Region's national economy achieved a continued great leap forward victory. By the end of August, the total industrial output value had increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, and the output of major industrial products had greatly increased compared to the same period last year. The amount of basic construction investment completed increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year. In particular, the steel production capacity has greatly increased, with steel mills growing from one to thirty-six, and the capacity of iron smelting equipment increasing more than twenty times compared to last year. Transportation volume and turnover increased by 156% and 54% respectively compared to the same period last year. In agricultural production, the combination of increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated area, and the combination of developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry, have resulted in extremely good agricultural and animal husbandry production. Wheat increased by 30% compared to the exceptionally bumper harvest of 1958, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is a foregone conclusion. The survival rate of livestock breeding has greatly improved compared to last year. With the great leap forward in production and construction, the market situation has been consistently good, ensuring the supply of basic living materials (grain, oil, meat, cloth, etc.) for people of all ethnic groups. Retail sales of social commodities have greatly increased, prices have remained stable, and inventories have steadily increased. The four hundred and fifty-one people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated. The nearly 30,000 public canteens run by the people's communes are all well-managed and are generally supported by the masses. All of this shows that the economic and political situation in the Autonomous Region, like the whole country, has been very good.

	The meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, made some adjustments to the main production targets for the Autonomous Region this year. The adjusted main targets are: steel (excluding native steel) 60,000 tons, an increase of 1.29 times compared to last year; steelÊùê 40,000 tons, an increase of 1.2 times compared to last year; iron (excluding native iron) 120,000 tons, an increase of 2.9 times compared to last year. Grain 7 billion jin, an increase of 16.66% compared to last year; cotton 1.9 million dan, an increase of 65.22% compared to last year; oil crops 2.6 million dan, an increase of 72.18% compared to last year. Net increase of livestock 2.38 million head, an increase of 12.38% compared to last year. The adjusted targets are great leap forward targets and are very encouraging.

	The meeting pointed out that since the communication and implementation of the central government's instructions on opposing rightism, boosting morale, and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Party organizations at all levels and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have actively responded to the Party's call and have set off a new upsurge in the campaign to increase production and practice economy everywhere. As of the 20th, many units in the Autonomous Region's various national economic sectors had already completed their third-quarter plans ahead of schedule, and many units had completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. Among them, pig iron (excluding native iron) had already completed the state-allocated annual task of 120,000 tons by September 6th, an increase of more than six times compared to last year; by early September, steel production had increased by 97% compared to mid-August. The key oil production area on the oil front, the Karamay Oilfield, completed the third-quarter state oil production plan ahead of schedule on September 19th. The oil production volume on August 23rd reached 5,520 tons, exceeding the daily oil production of the Yumen Oil Mine and increasing by about double the daily production before the announcement of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution. Coal industry production in the first and middle ten days of September, compared with the same period in August, saw a 55.56% increase in raw coal, a 14.3% increase in coking coal, and a 21.56% increase in coke. As of September 25th, 440 units and individuals within the Autonomous Region's Transportation Department system had completed their annual plans. All of the 450+ people's communes across Xinjiang are making their greatest efforts to strive for bumper harvests of grain and cotton, abundant livestock, and actively preparing for agricultural and animal husbandry production next year. All of this once again proves the correctness of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. The meeting called on the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, rapidly push the campaign to increase production and practice economy to a climax, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule. To this end, the meeting requested that Party organizations at all levels continue to strengthen their leadership over the campaign to increase production and practice economy, implement political leadership, liberate thought, break superstitions, and vigorously promote mass movements. The high-yield, high-quality, low-cost red flag emulation campaign on the industrial front, the safety and economy emulation campaign on the transportation front, the large-area high-yield emulation campaign on the agricultural front, and the "five-good" movement on the commercial front should be developed more extensively and deeply. At the same time, it is required that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, relying on the wisdom and strength of the people, fully tap the internal potential for increasing production in their respective units, solve the difficulties in production, and carry forward the spirit of communism, take the initiative to support others, and do a good job in cooperative relations, and comprehensively complete the production plan.

	After analyzing the current situation in the Autonomous Region, the meeting pointed out that right-leaning thinking is also seriously present among some cadres in our Autonomous Region. On the basis of examining right-leaning thinking, the meeting refuted the various fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists against the General Line, against the Great Leap Forward, and against socialism with a large number of facts. It was unanimously agreed that the economic situation in the Autonomous Region, like the whole country, is not "very bad" as described by the right-leaning opportunists, but "very good."

	The meeting summarized the experiences and lessons learned since the Great Leap Forward last year. It pointed out:

	1.  We must adhere to the Party's General Line. The practice of the Great Leap Forward for more than a year has fully proved that the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and a whole set of two-legged walking policies put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee based on the experience of socialist construction in our country are completely correct. In the process of specifically implementing the General Line, we will inevitably encounter some temporary and local difficulties. We must not only implement the General Line when things are going smoothly, but also unswervingly advance along the path of the General Line when encountering difficulties. At any time and under any circumstances, we must improve our sense of smell, stand firm, and clarify the direction. We must resist any unhealthy tendencies against the General Line, against the Great Leap Forward, and against socialism, and we must never waver in the face of great storms, and we must never have any doubts about the General Line.

	2.  We must adhere to the Great Leap Forward. To change our country's "poor and blank" face as soon as possible and build our country into a strong socialist country, we must develop our country's socialist construction at the highest speed, and we must realize a great leap forward in all departments of the national economy. In the Great Leap Forward in the Autonomous Region last year and this year, both industrial and agricultural production have achieved tremendous growth, and the proportional relationship between the two is basically appropriate. In the Great Leap Forward, it is difficult to completely avoid individual, partial, and temporary uncoordination in the national economy, and it is not surprising that some tensions occur. As long as we can pay attention to timely adjustments, this temporary and partial uncoordination and tension can be prevented and overcome. We must never give up high speed and doubt the Great Leap Forward because we are afraid of some uncoordination and tension.

	3.  We must correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement. Since last year, the great achievements in industry, agriculture, and other fronts have been the result of vigorously carrying out mass movements. In the future, we must continue to vigorously carry out mass movements and adhere to the working method of the mass line.

	4.  We must thoroughly transform bourgeois ideology. Bourgeois individualism is incompatible with Party spirit. If bourgeois individualism is not overcome, it will still develop into anti-Party and anti-people, and eventually it will destroy itself. Every Communist Party member should not relax self-transformation at any time, and should seriously study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works, improve communist awareness, strive to overcome pride, and humbly and sincerely accept the supervision of Party organizations and the masses.

	5.  We must constantly strengthen Party unity. Party unity is the life of the Party and is the decisive key to ensuring ethnic unity in the Autonomous Region and ensuring the victory of the General Line. Without Party unity, it is impossible to build a socialist society.
