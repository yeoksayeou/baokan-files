Adhere to the General Line and Continuously Leap Forward
	Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee Sums Up Experiences and Lessons, Proposes Goals

	(Reported by this newspaper) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from August 25th to September 27th. The meeting listened to Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, convey the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and earnestly studied and discussed the various resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, unanimously expressing their support. The meeting cited a large number of facts and criticized the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres in the Autonomous Region. Through this meeting, all the comrades present further strengthened their class stance and improved their ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to identify the direction of the wind.

	The meeting analyzed the situation in the Autonomous Region and unanimously agreed that, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the Autonomous Region Party Committee's resolute implementation of the Party's General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the national economy of the Autonomous Region had achieved rapid development. In 1959, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the Autonomous Region's national economy achieved a continued great leap forward victory. By the end of August, the total industrial output value had increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, and the output of major industrial products had greatly increased compared to the same period last year. The amount of basic construction investment completed increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year. In particular, the steel production capacity has greatly increased, with steel mills growing from one to thirty-six, and the capacity of iron smelting equipment increasing more than twenty times compared to last year. Transportation volume and turnover increased by 156% and 54% respectively compared to the same period last year. In agricultural production, the combination of increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated area, and the combination of developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry, have resulted in extremely good agricultural and animal husbandry production. Wheat increased by 30% compared to the exceptionally bumper harvest of 1958, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is a foregone conclusion. The survival rate of livestock breeding has greatly improved compared to last year. With the great leap forward in production and construction, the market situation has been consistently good, ensuring the supply of basic living materials (grain, oil, meat, cloth, etc.) for people of all ethnic groups. Retail sales of social commodities have greatly increased, prices have remained stable, and inventories have steadily increased. The four hundred and fifty-one people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated. The nearly 30,000 public canteens run by the people's communes are all well-managed and are generally supported by the masses. All of this shows that the economic and political situation in the Autonomous Region, like the whole country, has been very good.

	The meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, made some adjustments to the main production targets for the Autonomous Region this year. The adjusted main targets are: steel (excluding native steel) 60,000 tons, an increase of 1.29 times compared to last year; steel材 40,000 tons, an increase of 1.2 times compared to last year; iron (excluding native iron) 120,000 tons, an increase of 2.9 times compared to last year. Grain 7 billion jin, an increase of 16.66% compared to last year; cotton 1.9 million dan, an increase of 65.22% compared to last year; oil crops 2.6 million dan, an increase of 72.18% compared to last year. Net increase of livestock 2.38 million head, an increase of 12.38% compared to last year. The adjusted targets are great leap forward targets and are very encouraging.

	The meeting pointed out that since the communication and implementation of the central government's instructions on opposing rightism, boosting morale, and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Party organizations at all levels and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have actively responded to the Party's call and have set off a new upsurge in the campaign to increase production and practice economy everywhere. As of the 20th, many units in the Autonomous Region's various national economic sectors had already completed their third-quarter plans ahead of schedule, and many units had completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. Among them, pig iron (excluding native iron) had already completed the state-allocated annual task of 120,000 tons by September 6th, an increase of more than six times compared to last year; by early September, steel production had increased by 97% compared to mid-August. The key oil production area on the oil front, the Karamay Oilfield, completed the third-quarter state oil production plan ahead of schedule on September 19th. The oil production volume on August 23rd reached 5,520 tons, exceeding the daily oil production of the Yumen Oil Mine and increasing by about double the daily production before the announcement of the Eighth Plenary Session resolution. Coal industry production in the first and middle ten days of September, compared with the same period in August, saw a 55.56% increase in raw coal, a 14.3% increase in coking coal, and a 21.56% increase in coke. As of September 25th, 440 units and individuals within the Autonomous Region's Transportation Department system had completed their annual plans. All of the 450+ people's communes across Xinjiang are making their greatest efforts to strive for bumper harvests of grain and cotton, abundant livestock, and actively preparing for agricultural and animal husbandry production next year. All of this once again proves the correctness of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. The meeting called on the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, rapidly push the campaign to increase production and practice economy to a climax, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule. To this end, the meeting requested that Party organizations at all levels continue to strengthen their leadership over the campaign to increase production and practice economy, implement political leadership, liberate thought, break superstitions, and vigorously promote mass movements. The high-yield, high-quality, low-cost red flag emulation campaign on the industrial front, the safety and economy emulation campaign on the transportation front, the large-area high-yield emulation campaign on the agricultural front, and the "five-good" movement on the commercial front should be developed more extensively and deeply. At the same time, it is required that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, relying on the wisdom and strength of the people, fully tap the internal potential for increasing production in their respective units, solve the difficulties in production, and carry forward the spirit of communism, take the initiative to support others, and do a good job in cooperative relations, and comprehensively complete the production plan.

	After analyzing the current situation in the Autonomous Region, the meeting pointed out that right-leaning thinking is also seriously present among some cadres in our Autonomous Region. On the basis of examining right-leaning thinking, the meeting refuted the various fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists against the General Line, against the Great Leap Forward, and against socialism with a large number of facts. It was unanimously agreed that the economic situation in the Autonomous Region, like the whole country, is not "very bad" as described by the right-leaning opportunists, but "very good."

	The meeting summarized the experiences and lessons learned since the Great Leap Forward last year. It pointed out:

	1.  We must adhere to the Party's General Line. The practice of the Great Leap Forward for more than a year has fully proved that the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and a whole set of two-legged walking policies put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee based on the experience of socialist construction in our country are completely correct. In the process of specifically implementing the General Line, we will inevitably encounter some temporary and local difficulties. We must not only implement the General Line when things are going smoothly, but also unswervingly advance along the path of the General Line when encountering difficulties. At any time and under any circumstances, we must improve our sense of smell, stand firm, and clarify the direction. We must resist any unhealthy tendencies against the General Line, against the Great Leap Forward, and against socialism, and we must never waver in the face of great storms, and we must never have any doubts about the General Line.

	2.  We must adhere to the Great Leap Forward. To change our country's "poor and blank" face as soon as possible and build our country into a strong socialist country, we must develop our country's socialist construction at the highest speed, and we must realize a great leap forward in all departments of the national economy. In the Great Leap Forward in the Autonomous Region last year and this year, both industrial and agricultural production have achieved tremendous growth, and the proportional relationship between the two is basically appropriate. In the Great Leap Forward, it is difficult to completely avoid individual, partial, and temporary uncoordination in the national economy, and it is not surprising that some tensions occur. As long as we can pay attention to timely adjustments, this temporary and partial uncoordination and tension can be prevented and overcome. We must never give up high speed and doubt the Great Leap Forward because we are afraid of some uncoordination and tension.

	3.  We must correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement. Since last year, the great achievements in industry, agriculture, and other fronts have been the result of vigorously carrying out mass movements. In the future, we must continue to vigorously carry out mass movements and adhere to the working method of the mass line.

	4.  We must thoroughly transform bourgeois ideology. Bourgeois individualism is incompatible with Party spirit. If bourgeois individualism is not overcome, it will still develop into anti-Party and anti-people, and eventually it will destroy itself. Every Communist Party member should not relax self-transformation at any time, and should seriously study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works, improve communist awareness, strive to overcome pride, and humbly and sincerely accept the supervision of Party organizations and the masses.

	5.  We must constantly strengthen Party unity. Party unity is the life of the Party and is the decisive key to ensuring ethnic unity in the Autonomous Region and ensuring the victory of the General Line. Without Party unity, it is impossible to build a socialist society.

　　坚持总路线　不断大跃进
    新疆维吾尔自治区党委总结经验教训提出奋斗目标
    本报讯　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会从8月25日到9月27日举行了扩大会议，会议听取了自治区党委第一书记王恩茂同志关于八届八中全会的传达，认真学习和讨论了八中全会的各项决议，一致表示拥护。会议列举大量事实，批判了自治区部分干部中的右倾思想。通过这次会议，全体到会同志进一步坚定了阶级立场，提高了明辨是非、识别风向的能力。
    会议分析了自治区的形势，一致认为由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导，自治区党委坚决贯彻执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，自治区的国民经济获得迅速发展。1959年自治区国民经济在1958年大跃进的基础上，取得了继续大跃进的胜利。到8月底，工业总产值比去年同期增长了一倍多，主要工业产品产量比去年同期都有很大的增长。基本建设投资完成的数量比去年同期增长30％以上，特别是钢铁生产能力有了很大的增长，钢铁厂从原来的一个厂发展到三十六个厂，炼铁设备能力比去年增加了二十多倍。交通运输量和周转量分别比去年同期增长156％和54％。在农业生产上，实行提高单位面积产量与扩大耕地面积相结合，发展农业与发展牧业相结合，农牧业生产情况极为良好。小麦比特大丰收的1958年增长30％，秋田作物丰收已成定局。牲畜繁殖成活率比去年有很大提高。随着生产建设的大跃进，市场形势一直良好，保证了各族人民基本生活资料（粮、油、肉、布等）的供应，社会商品零售额大大增长，物价继续稳定，库存日渐增加。四百五十一个人民公社日益巩固。人民公社举办的近三万个公共食堂办得都好，普遍受到群众的拥护。这一切都说明：自治区的经济形势和政治形势同全国一样，一直是很好的。
    会议根据八届八中全会精神，对自治区今年的主要生产指标作了若干调整。调整后的主要指标为：钢（不包括土钢）六万吨，比去年增长一点二九倍；钢材四万吨，比去年增长一点二倍；铁（不包括土铁）十二万吨，比去年增长二点九倍。粮食七十亿斤，比去年增长16.66％；棉花一百九十万担，比去年增长65.22％；油料二百六十万担，比去年增长72.18％。牲畜净增二百三十八万头，比去年增长12.38％。调整后的指标，是一个大跃进的指标，是一个十分鼓舞人心的指标。
    会议指出：自从传达和贯彻了中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的指示后，自治区各级党组织和各族人民，积极地响应党的号召，到处掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮。到20日为止，自治区各国民经济部门，已经有许多单位，提前完成了第三季度的计划，有不少单位，提前完成了今年的计划。其中生铁（不包括土铁）在9月6日已经完成国家分配的全年十二万吨的任务，比去年增长了六倍多；钢产量到9月上旬，比8月中旬增长了97％。石油战线上采油的重点——克拉玛依油区在9月19日提前完成了第三季度国家采油计划，8月23日的采油量达到五千五百二十吨，超过了玉门油矿的采油日产量，比八中全会决议公布前日产量提高一倍左右。煤炭工业9月上、中旬的生产，比8月份同期，原煤增长55.56％，炼焦煤增产14.3％，焦炭增长21.56％。自治区交通厅系统到9月25日，已经完成全年计划的有四百四十个单位和个人。全疆的四百五十多个人民公社，正在尽最大努力争取今年粮棉超产、牲畜丰收和为明年的农牧业生产积极进行准备。所有这些，都再一次证明了总路线和大跃进的正确。会议号召自治区全党和各族人民坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议，迅速把增产节约运动推向高潮，千方百计战胜困难，争取提前和超额完成今年的国民经济计划。为此，会议要求各级党组织继续加强对增产节约运动的领导，实行政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信，大搞群众运动。把工业战线上的高产、优质、低成本红旗竞赛，运输战线上的安全、节约竞赛，农业战线上的大面积丰产竞赛，商业战线上的“五好”运动等，更加广泛深入地发展下去。同时要求在增产节约运动中，依靠人民群众的智慧和力量，充分挖掘本单位内部的增产潜力，解决生产中的困难，并且发扬共产主义精神，主动支援别人，搞好协作关系，全面地完成生产计划。
    会议在分析了自治区当前的形势以后，指出：右倾思想在我们自治区一部分干部中也是严重存在的。会议在检查右倾思想的基础上，用大量的事实，驳斥了右倾机会主义分子反对总路线、反对大跃进、反对社会主义的各种谬论。一致认为：自治区的经济形势和全国一样，完全不像右倾机会主义分子所描绘的那样“糟得很”，而是“好得很”。
    会议总结了去年大跃进以来的经验教训。指出：
    一、必须坚持党的总路线。在一年多大跃进的实践中，完全证明了毛主席和党中央根据我国社会主义建设的经验，提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，和一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。在具体执行总路线的过程中，一定会遇到某些暂时的、局部的困难。不但要在顺利的时候，贯彻执行总路线，而且在遇到困难的时候，也要坚定不移地沿着总路线的道路前进。在任何时候，任何情况下，都要提高嗅觉，站稳立场，明确方向。对任何反总路线、反大跃进、反社会主义的歪风邪气，一定要顶住，决不能在大风浪中发生动摇，决不能对总路线有任何怀疑。
    二、必须坚持大跃进。要尽早地改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家，必须用最高的速度来发展我国社会主义建设事业，必须在国民经济的各部门实现大跃进。自治区去年和今年大跃进中，工业和农业的生产都有了巨大的增长，两者之间的比例关系基本上是适当的，在大跃进中，国民经济个别的、局部的、暂时性的不够协调也是很难完全避免的，发生某些紧张也是不足奇怪的。只要我们能够注意及时调整，这种暂时的、局部的不够协调和紧张是可以防止和克服的。决不能因为害怕发生某些不够协调和紧张而放弃高速度，对大跃进发生怀疑。
    三、必须正确地对待革命的群众运动。去年以来，工业、农业及其它各个战线上所以获得伟大成就，是轰轰烈烈地大搞群众运动的结果。今后我们必须继续大搞群众运动，坚持群众路线的工作方法。
    四、必须彻底改造资产阶级思想。资产阶级个人主义与党性是水火不相容的，资产阶级个人主义如果不加克服，仍然会发展到反党反人民，最后，必然会毁灭自己。每一个共产党员，在任何时候，都不要放松自我改造，都要认真学习马列主义，特别是要学习毛主席的著作，提高共产主义觉悟，力戒骄傲，虚心、诚恳地接受党组织和群众的监督。
    五、必须不断增强党的团结。党的团结就是党的生命，是保证自治区民族团结、保证总路线取得胜利的决定关键。没有党的团结，要建成社会主义社会是不可能的。
