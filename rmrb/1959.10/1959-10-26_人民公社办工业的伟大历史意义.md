The Great Historical Significance of People's Communes Running Industry
Deputy Director of the State Economic Commission Sun Zhiyuan
People's communes running industry is the inevitable product of communization, and it has ten major advantages.

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958 in our country, many new things emerged. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, the broad masses of peasants broke the superstition about running industry and started running industry themselves, which is a matter of great historical significance.
    Achieving rural industrialization is the strong desire of Chinese peasants for many years. In old China, this was, of course, an impossible fantasy. After liberation, especially during the period of agricultural cooperatives, peasants had already begun to run industry, but the number was still small. After the realization of people's communes throughout the country, the industries of the people's communes run by the peasants themselves developed universally in the vast rural areas of our country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. An engaging scene of "machines ringing everywhere, factories all over the towns and countryside" is already in sight. The vast rural areas have not only had a great leap forward in agricultural production, but also a great leap forward in industry. Agricultural tools, fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural product processing, sugar making, paper making, textile, as well as building materials, mining, metallurgy, electricity, petroleum and other light and heavy industrial production serving agricultural production and peasant life have achieved leapfrog development. Up to now, there are about 700,000 industrial production units in the people's communes nationwide. In the commune industry, self-sufficient production accounts for about 70%, and commodity production accounts for about 30%. In all products, means of production and consumer goods roughly account for half each. Although the people's commune industry has not been established for a long time, it has already made important contributions and demonstrated its far-reaching future.
    The large-scale development of people's commune industry is not accidental. It is the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the communization. Due to the guidance of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the needs of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and the communization, the great development of rural industry has become an inevitable trend. At the same time, the many advantages of rural small-scale industry can be fully brought into play. Compared with the national large-scale industry, what are the advantages of the people's commune industry? First, the investment is small, which is convenient for absorbing scattered funds; second, the construction time is short, and the investment effect is realized quickly; third, it can design and supply equipment by itself, which is convenient for utilizing various existing equipment locally in a simple and crude way; fourth, the distribution is wide, which is convenient for promoting the industrialization of the whole country, promoting the growth of technical forces in the whole country, and promoting the balanced economic development of various regions; fifth, it can produce a wide variety of products, and it is easy to change products; sixth, it is close to raw materials and markets, which can flexibly utilize resources, save transportation costs, and facilitate the combination of supply, production, and sales; seventh, the workers of commune industry can engage in industry during slack farming seasons and agriculture during busy farming seasons, being both workers and peasants, which is convenient for the rational use of labor force; eighth, it is convenient for widely organizing handicraft workers scattered in the vast rural areas, giving play to their technical talents, and gradually realizing the factoryization, semi-mechanization, and mechanization of rural handicrafts; ninth, it can promote agricultural modernization; tenth, it is an important way to gradually eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas.

    It is beneficial to promote the great leap forward in agricultural production and accelerate the process of agricultural modernization.
    The people's commune industry has powerfully promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production. According to the survey of seventeen provinces and cities, in 1958 alone, the people's commune industry manufactured and repaired more than 100 million pieces of agricultural tools, provided the agricultural sector with more than 290,000 tons of cement, more than 2.4 million tons of indigenous iron, more than 530,000 tons of indigenous steel, more than 25.3 million tons of raw coal, and 36.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Taking Hebei Province as an example, almost all the newly added industrial products such as seeders, cultivators, and indigenous fertilizers in 1958 were products of commune industry. Because commune industry provided agriculture with a large amount of means of production, it greatly improved labor efficiency, saved labor, and increased production. For example, the water conservancy project task of Sanmiaoqian People's Commune in Poyang County, Jiangxi Province last winter and this spring was originally very arduous, but because the commune-run industry reformed fifteen kinds of tools, it not only saved more than 28,000 labor days, but also completed the task half a month ahead of schedule. In the past, Jinjing Commune in Changsha, Hunan Province needed to purchase all its chemical fertilizers and pesticides from other places and could not meet the actual needs. After the development of the commune-run indigenous fertilizer factory, it produced 670 tons of indigenous fertilizer this year, applying an average of 75 kilograms of indigenous fertilizer per mu, which quickly raised more than 8,000 mu of third-class seedlings to first-class seedlings. At the same time, the industries run by the people's communes to serve the lives of the commune members not only facilitated and improved the lives of the commune members, but also greatly saved rural labor and animal power, thereby promoting the development of agricultural production. For example, from January to May this year, Lutun Commune in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, processed 600 tons of sorghum, 1,350 tons of corn cobs, 450 tons of millet, and 650 tons of rice through commune industry. Compared with the past processing by manpower and animal power, it saved 16,550 man-days and 8,375 animal-power workdays; the clothing factory processed clothing from January to May, saving more than 50,000 women's labor days. The development of the people's commune industry has only been one year, and it has made so many achievements in promoting the great leap forward in agriculture. It can be imagined that with its further development, and with the increasing support of the state's large-scale industry for agriculture, the realization of mechanization and electrification in the rural areas of our country will be greatly shortened than originally envisioned. Because we not only have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have the advanced socialist system, but also, in our march towards agricultural modernization, we have not only the modernized large-scale enterprises as the main force, but also the people's commune industry as a strong local force. Under such conditions, accelerating the modernization of agriculture in our country has a reliable guarantee. And with the realization of agricultural modernization, the rural areas of our country will not only provide our people with infinitely abundant agricultural products, but also liberate hundreds of millions of laborers. Relying on so much labor, we can develop our industry, transportation, culture and science, and other undertakings on a scale incomparably larger than now, and create endless wealth.

    It is beneficial to the great leap forward in industrial production and accelerate the process of industrialization.
    People's communes running industry on a large scale is not only beneficial to promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production and accelerating the process of agricultural modernization, but also beneficial to promoting the great leap forward in industrial production and accelerating the process of national industrialization. At present, the total output value of the people's commune industry in the country accounts for about 10% of the total industrial output value. Taking Hebei Province as an example, the proportion of commune industry in the province's industry in 1958 was: hydropower generation accounted for 76%, iron ore production accounted for 26%, manganese ore production accounted for 36.6%, coke production accounted for 16.4%, gold production accounted for 36%, simple machine tool production accounted for 16.8%, water wheel production accounted for 30.8%, ball bearing production accounted for 41.8%, brick production accounted for 43.3%, edible vegetable oil production accounted for 16%, sugar production accounted for 29%, and starch production accounted for 74.9%. It can be seen that the people's commune industry is an important part of the national industrialization. The development of the people's commune industry, on the one hand, relies on the support of the national large-scale industry, and on the other hand, creates better conditions for the development of the national industry. For example, the people's commune industry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in just a few months in 1958, mined a total of more than 1.3 million tons of various ores such as iron, copper, gold, manganese, lead, and fluorite, and produced building materials such as bricks, tiles, and lime to support the national industry. In this way, the national industry and the commune industry promote each other, and they will surely be able to accelerate the process of national industrialization and commune industrialization.
    Everyone still remembers that the industry of old China was mainly concentrated in a few coastal cities, while many resource-rich areas in the interior had little industry. Now, we have not only built the Northeast Industrial Base centered on Anshan and strengthened the industrial base in Shanghai, Tianjin, and coastal areas, but also many new industrial bases are being built in the heartland of our country. On the map of our great motherland, countless new industrial points have appeared in many places that were unknown to people in the past, and even uninhabited places. These new industrial points, in turn, link the commune industry all over the vast rural areas of the country with the industrial bases, and initially form a large-scale urban and rural industrial network. This urban and rural industrial network is a sketch of socialist industrialized New China. On the basis of this sketch, we will draw the newest and most beautiful pictures.

    It is beneficial to the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and beneficial to the elimination of the three major differences.
    People's communes running industry on a large scale also has more far-reaching significance. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The development of commune industry will not only accelerate the process of national industrialization, but also promote the realization of ownership by the whole people in the rural areas and narrow the differences between cities and villages." The most basic condition for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people is to improve the level of social production and have relatively abundant products. And the communes running industry on a large scale plays an important role in constantly enriching products. In the current people's communes, the ownership of the production team is basic, and the ownership of the commune is partial. The ownership of the commune is the enterprises and undertakings run by the commune, as well as the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund controlled by the commune. The ownership of the commune actually contains some elements of ownership by the whole people. According to the survey of 7,000 people's commune industrial production units, the industry directly led and managed by the commune management committee and jointly run by more than two communes accounts for about 58% of the total output value of the commune industry, the industry managed by the management district accounts for 23%, and the industry managed by the production team accounts for 19%. It can be seen that the further development of commune industry will greatly increase the public accumulation part of the commune and strengthen the economic strength of the commune level. In this way, it is beneficial for the people's commune to gradually transition from the current socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people.
    The establishment and development of commune industry is also greatly beneficial to accelerating the narrowing of the differences between urban and rural areas, and between workers and peasants. We know that the implementation of the combination of agriculture and industry and the gradual elimination of the differences between urban and rural areas is a great ideal that was put forward as early as the "Communist Manifesto". After our country won the victory of the socialist revolution, although the antagonistic relationship between urban and rural areas no longer exists, the major differences between urban and rural areas still exist. So, how to eliminate this difference? Some people hold a mysterious view on this. They think that this is a matter of the distant future that is "promising but unattainable." In fact, it is not so. The General Line for socialist construction and the policy of "five simultaneities" formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific conditions of our country, that is, to pave the way for gradually narrowing and eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, and between workers and peasants. And the people's communes running industry on a large scale is a very important condition for implementing the combination of agriculture and industry and gradually narrowing these differences. Because this large-scale development of rural industry can greatly promote the use of modern technology in rural areas, as well as promote the improvement of rural transportation conditions, the progress of science and culture and the development of other undertakings, thereby gradually raising the economic and cultural backward rural areas to the level of modern cities. At the same time, the large-scale industry run by the rural areas creates opportunities for the vast number of peasants to approach industry, and can popularize and improve the technical level of the vast number of peasants on a large scale. For example, after the people's commune in Zhijin County, Guizhou Province ran industry on a large scale, in the county's more than 9,800 basic industrial teams, after practical production training, more than 90% of them learned and mastered various different technologies, forming a new type of laborer who "is a peasant when going to the field and a worker when entering the factory."

    In short, people's communes running industry on a large scale is a great creation of the people of our country. The more developed the commune industry, the more it can promote the industrialization of the rural areas of our country and the consolidation of the people's commune system. At present, the industry of the people's communes is only a starting point for the great goal of realizing the industrialization of the communes, but from this starting point, people can already see its glorious and splendid future. Let us, under the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, muster even greater revolutionary zeal and constantly push forward the cause of industrialization of the people's communes!

    人民公社办工业的伟大历史意义
    国家经济委员会副主任　孙志远
    人民公社办工业是公社化后的必然产物，它有十大优点
    1958年我国大跃进中，出现了许许多多新鲜的事情。在党的总路线的照耀下，广大农民破除了办工业的迷信，自己动手办工业，就是一项具有伟大历史意义的事情。
    实现农村工业化，这是我国农民多少年来的强烈愿望。在旧中国这当然是一个不可能实现的空想。在解放以后，特别是在农业合作社时期，农民就已经开始举办工业，可是为数还不多。全国农村实现了人民公社化后，由农民自己举办的人民公社的工业，就像雨后春笋一样，在我国广大农村中普遍地发展起来了。一幅“机器到处响，工厂遍城乡”的引人入胜的景象，已经在望了。广大农村不但有了农业的大跃进，而且有了工业的大跃进，为农业生产和农民生活服务的农具、肥料、农药、农产品加工、制糖、造纸、纺织以及建筑材料、采矿、冶金、电力、石油等轻重工业生产获得了飞跃的发展。到目前为止，全国人民公社共有工业生产单位七十万个左右。在公社工业中，自给性生产约占70％左右，商品性生产约占30％左右。在全部产品中，生产资料和消费资料大体上各占一半。人民公社工业建立时间虽然不久，但是，它已经做出了重要的贡献，显示出它的远大前途。
    人民公社工业大规模的发展不是偶然的，它是总路线、大跃进、人民公社化的必然产物。由于党的社会主义建设总路线的指引，国民经济大跃进和人民公社化的需要，农村工业的大发展，就成为一种必然的趋势，同时，农村小型工业所具有的许多优点也就能够充分地发挥出来。人民公社工业同国家大工业比较起来，它有哪些优点呢？第一、投资少，便于吸收分散的资金；第二、建设时间短，投资效果发挥快；第三、可以自己设计和供应设备，便于因陋就简地利用当地各种现成的设备；第四、分布广，便于促进全国的工业化，促进全国技术力量的生长，促进各地区经济的平衡发展；第五、可以生产的品种多，改变产品也容易；第六、接近原料和市场，可以灵活地利用资源，节约运输费用，供产销也易于结合；第七、公社工业的职工可以农闲办工业，农忙办农业，亦工亦农，便于劳动力的合理使用；第八、它便于广泛地组织分散在广大农村的手工业工人，发挥他们的技术才能，使农村手工业逐步实现工厂化、半机械化和机械化。第九、它可以促进农业现代化。第十、它是逐步作到消灭城乡差别的一个重要途径。
    有利于促进农业生产大跃进和加速农业现代化的过程
    人民公社工业，有力地促进了农业生产的大跃进。根据十七个省市的调查，只在1958年一年内，人民公社工业就制造和修理了农具一亿多件，提供农业部门水泥二十九万多吨，土铁二百四十多万吨，土钢五十三万吨，原煤二千五百三十万吨，发电三千六百四十万度。以河北省为例，1958年新增加的播种机、中耕器、土化肥等工业品，几乎全部都是公社工业的产品。由于公社工业向农业提供了大量的生产资料，因而大大提高劳动效率，节约了劳动力，增加了生产。如江西波阳县三庙前人民公社去冬今春的水利工程任务本来是非常艰巨的，但是，由于社办工业改革了十五项工具，不仅节省了二万八千多个劳动日，而且还提前半月完成任务。湖南省长沙金井公社过去所需化肥、农药全部由外地购买，并且不能满足实际需要，社办土化肥工厂发展起来以后，今年就生产了土化肥六百七十吨，平均每亩施土化肥七十五公斤，使八千多亩三类苗很快的提升为一类苗。同时，人民公社所举办的为社员生活服务的工业，也不仅便利和改善了社员生活，而且大大节约了农村的劳动力和畜力，从而促进了农业生产的发展。如辽宁省盖平县芦屯公社，今年1至5月公社工业加工的高粱六百吨，苞米?子一千三百五十吨，谷子四百五十吨，水稻六百五十吨，较过去用人力和畜力加工，节约人工一万六千五百五十个，节约畜力工八千三百七十五个；被服厂1至5月加工的衣物，就节约了妇女劳动日五万多个。人民公社工业的发展才仅仅一年，就在促进农业大跃进方面做出了这么多的成绩。可以想见，它的进一步发展，以及在国家的大型工业对农业越多的支援的情况下，我国农村的机械化、电气化事业的实现必将比原来设想的时间，大大缩短。因为我们不但有中国共产党的领导，有先进的社会主义制度，而且，我们在向农业现代化进军中，既有了现代化大型企业这样的主力军，又有了人民公社工业这样力量雄厚的地方军。在这样的条件之下，加速我国农业的现代化就有了可靠的保证。而实现了农业现代化，我国农村，不但将为我国人民提供无限丰富的农产品，而且将解放出成亿的劳动力来。依靠这么多的劳动力，我们就可以在比现在大得不可比拟的规模上发展我们的工业、运输业、文化科学事业以及其它事业，就可创造出无穷无尽的财富。有利于工业生产大跃进和加速工业化的进程
    人民公社大办工业，不仅有利于促进农业生产的大跃进和加速农业现代化的进程。同时，还有利于促进工业生产的大跃进和加速国家工业化的进程。目前全国人民公社工业的生产总值约占全部工业总产值的10％左右。以河北省为例，1958年公社工业在全省工业中所占的比重是：水力发电占76％，铁矿石生产占26％，锰矿石生产占36.6％，焦炭生产占16.4％，黄金生产占36％，简易机床生产占16.8％，水车生产占30.8％，滚珠轴承生产占41.8％，砖的生产占43.3％，食用植物油的生产占16％，食糖的生产占29％，淀粉的生产占74.9％。可见，人民公社工业是国家工业化的一个重要组成部分，人民公社工业的发展，一方面，要依靠国家大工业的支援，另一方面，又为国家工业的发展创造更好的条件。如内蒙古自治区人民公社工业在1958年的几个月光景，曾开采了铁、铜、金、锰、铅、萤石等各种矿石共一百三十余万吨，并且生产了砖、瓦、石灰等建筑材料支援了国家工业。这样，国家工业和公社工业互相促进，就一定能够加快国家工业化和公社工业化的进程。
    大家还记得，旧中国的工业主要集中在少数沿海城市，而内地许多资源丰富的地区，却没有什么工业。现在，我们不但建成了以鞍山为中心的东北工业基地，加强了上海、天津和沿海地区的工业基础，而且在我国的腹心地区，许多新的工业基地正在兴建起来。在我国伟大祖国的地图上过去许多为人们所不知名的地方，甚至是荒无人烟的地方，都出现了无数的新的工业点。这些新的工业点，又把遍布全国广大农村的公社工业同工业基地联结起来，初步形成了一个规模宏大的城乡工业网。这个城乡工业网，是社会主义工业化的新中国的素描，在这个素描的基础上，我们将要画出最新最美的画图。
    有利于由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，有利于三大差别的消灭
    人民公社大办工业，还有更为深远的意义。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“公社工业的发展不但将加快国家工业化的进程，而且将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。”由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，最基本的一个条件，就是要提高社会生产水平，要产品比较丰富。而公社大办工业对于不断丰富产品起着重要的作用。在目前的人民公社中，生产队的所有制是基本的，公社所有制是部分的，公社所有制就是为公社所举办的企业、事业以及由公社支配的公积金和公益金等。公社所有制中，实际上已经包含着某种全民所有制的成份。根据七千个人民公社工业生产单位的调查，属于公社管理委员会直接领导管理和两个公社以上合办的工业，约占全部公社工业总产值58％，管理区领导管理的占23％，生产队管理的占19％。可以看出，公社工业的进一步发展必将大大增加公社的公共积累部分，加强公社一级的经济力量。这样，就有利于人民公社从目前社会主义集体所有制逐步地过渡到社会主义全民所有制。
    公社工业的建立和发展，还大大有利于加速缩小城市和乡村之间、工人和农民之间的差别。我们知道，实行农业同工业结合和逐步消灭城乡之间的差别，这是早在“共产党宣言”中就提出来了的伟大的理想。在我国取得了社会主义革命的胜利后，城乡之间的对立关系虽然不存在了，但是，城乡之间的重大差别却仍然存在。那么，如何消灭这种差别呢？有些人对此抱着神秘的观点。认为这是“可望而不可及的”遥远将来的事情。实际上，并不是如此。党中央和毛主席根据马列主义普遍真理和我国具体情况所制定的社会主义建设总路线和“五个并举”的方针，也就是为逐步缩小和消灭城乡之间、工农之间的差别开辟道路，而人民公社大办工业，就是实行农业同工业结合和逐步缩小这些差别的一个很重要的条件。因为这种农村工业的大发展既可大大推动农村对现代技术的利用、以及促进农村交通条件的改善、科学文化的进步和其他各项事业的发展，从而把经济文化落后的农村面貌逐步地提高到现代城市的水平，同时，农村大办工业，造成广大农民接近工业的机会，可以大规模地普及和提高广大农民的技术水平。如贵州省织金县人民公社大办工业后，在全县九千八百多个工业基本队伍中，经过实际生产的锻炼，其中90％以上学会和掌握了各种不同的技术，形成了“下地是农民，进厂是工人”新型的劳动者。
    总之，人民公社大办工业，是我国人民的伟大创举，公社工业愈发达，就愈能够促进我国农村工业化和人民公社制度的巩固。现时人民公社的工业，对于实现公社工业化这个伟大的奋斗目标来说，还不过是一个起点，但是从这个起点中人们已经可以看得到它的光辉灿烂的将来。让我们在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜下，鼓足更大的革命干劲，把人民公社工业化的事业不断地推向前进吧！
