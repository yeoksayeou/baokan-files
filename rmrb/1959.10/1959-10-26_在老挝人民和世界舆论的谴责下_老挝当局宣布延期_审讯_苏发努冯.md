    Under Condemnation from the Lao People and World Opinion,
    Lao Authorities Announce Postponement of "Trial" of Souphanouvong
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th – Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao Ministry of Justice announced on the 24th that the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and the other seven leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front has been postponed.
    The Lao Ministry of Justice, in announcing the postponement of the "trial" originally scheduled for October 26th, explained that this was "due to some technical reasons." According to Agence France-Presse, the judge investigating the case needs more time to "remedy the defects in the accusations against Prince Souphanouvong and the other defendants."
    The United States-Sananiqone clique's conspiracy to blatantly sabotage the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements by preparing to illegally try the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front was met with unanimous opposition from the Lao people and condemnation from world opinion as soon as it was announced. At the same time, the United States-Sananiqone clique is racking its brains to fabricate "evidence" of the "crimes" of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.
    According to the Associated Press, diplomats in Vientiane believe that the illegal trial originally scheduled for the 26th was "ill-timed." This is because the "trial" coincided with the so-called "investigation report" submitted to the Security Council by the United Nations "Fact-Finding Subcommittee on Laos." A senior diplomatic official said, "They should at least wait until the report is submitted."
    The Lao authorities are preparing to conduct an illegal trial of Prince Souphanouvong and others using extremely despicable means. According to reports, the "trial" court will be located in a "special room" next to the Prime Minister's Office. The defendants' "defense lawyers" are all appointed by the court.

    在老挝人民和世界舆论的谴责下
    老挝当局宣布延期“审讯”苏发努冯
    新华社河内25日电　万象消息：老挝司法部24日宣布，对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他七位领导人的“审讯”，已经决定延期举行。
    老挝司法部在宣布原定在10月26日举行的“审讯”延期时解释说，这是“由于一些技术上的原因”。据法新社说，调查案件的法官需要有更多的时间来“弥补对苏发努冯亲王和其他被告的控告的缺陷”。
    美国—萨纳尼空集团准备非法审讯老挝爱国战线党领导人的明目张胆破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的阴谋公布以后，立即遭到老挝人民的一致反对和世界舆论的谴责。同时，美国—萨纳尼空集团正在为编造老挝爱国战线党领导人的“罪证”煞费脑筋。
    据美联社说，万象的外交人士认为，原定在26日举行的非法审讯是“时机不当”的。因为这次“审讯”同所谓联合国“调查老挝局势小组委员会”向安全理事会提出所谓“调查报告”恰恰是在同一个时候。一位高级外交官员说，“他们至少应该等到这项报告提出之后。”
    老挝当局准备对苏发努冯亲王等人用极其卑劣的手段进行非法审讯。据报道，“审讯”的法庭将设在紧靠着首相府旁边的一个“特别房间”内。被告的“辩护律师”都是由法庭指定的。
