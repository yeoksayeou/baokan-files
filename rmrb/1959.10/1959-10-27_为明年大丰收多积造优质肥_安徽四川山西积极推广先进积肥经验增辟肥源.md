Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 26th. Anhui Province has launched an autumn fertilizer accumulation campaign. According to recent statistics, the province has already accumulated more than 21.9 billion dan of various types of farm manure.

　　Currently, many hills and lake beaches are covered with lush grass and fallen leaves. Various regions are seizing this good opportunity to massively compost green manure. Wuhu Special District launched a "Thousand Catties of Grass per Person" campaign, with more than 600,000 people throughout the district going up the mountains and down to the lakes to cut green grass and collect aquatic plants. Langxi County's people's communes organized professional green grass cutting teams, setting up camps on the lake beaches and river dikes to cut large amounts of green grass. Wuwei County sends out more than 4,100 boats every day to collect aquatic plants from the lake. By October 18th, the entire special district had collected more than 6 billion catties of aquatic plants alone.

　　In order to save labor in transporting fertilizer and improve the efficiency of fertilizer accumulation and production, many people's communes have dug fertilizer composting pits in the fields for on-site composting of green manure.

　　In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, various regions have also massively burned soil fertilizer, dug ditch and pond mud, and collected human and animal manure. Fuyang Special District organized more than 30,000 fertilizer accumulation professional teams. In addition to composting more than 1.3 billion dan of green manure, they also burned 230 million dan of soil fertilizer, dug 700 million dan of ditch mud, accumulated 1.6 billion dan of human and animal manure, and accumulated 580 million dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer. In Letu Commune, Mengcheng County, 85% of the autumn-sown fields have been burned with soil fertilizer. This not only increases soil fertility but also eliminates weeds and pests.

　　Chengdu, 23rd. More than 30,000 local fertilizer factories in Sichuan Province have launched a production upsurge to prepare high-quality fertilizer for next year's spring crops. From September 1st to October 8th, in thirty-eight days, according to incomplete statistics, the province has produced 2.2 billion catties of local fertilizer.

　　The campaign to vigorously develop local fertilizer was launched under the situation where Party organizations at all levels in rural areas throughout the province implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, opposed right-leaning tendencies, and boosted morale. When summarizing the experience of this year's spring harvest, the county and commune Party committees all mobilized the masses to calculate the need for fertilizer and the shortage of fertilizer, and criticized the lax, fearful, and right-leaning conservative ideas. This made the vast number of cadres and masses realize that without high-quality, effective local fertilizer, it would be impossible to meet the needs of crop production. In a short period of time, more than 1,500 fertilizer factories in various communes in Wanxian were put into production, producing more than 100 million catties of local fertilizer. Anle People's Commune in Hanyuan County extracted more than 150 people to vigorously restore and develop the production of local fertilizer, and produced 5.78 million catties of local fertilizer in a short period of time. Many areas also used waste, waste smoke, and waste steam from commune-run industries to recycle and produce local fertilizer. These fertilizers are low in cost and high in quality, and are extremely popular.

　　In the campaign to vigorously develop local fertilizer, local fertilizer factories at the special district and county levels also exerted great efforts to produce large quantities of fertilizer to support the countryside. The county-run fertilizer factories in Leshan, Mianyang, and Wenjiang Special Districts alone produced 15,000 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer and transported it to the countryside before October. Many county-run fertilizer factories have also broken the mysterious view of developing fertilizer and overcome the difficulties of equipment, using local methods to produce high-quality fertilizer. For example, the staff of the Datian First Fertilizer Factory used local methods to produce more than ten kinds of fertilizer, such as humic acid sodium fertilizer, phosphate bacteria fertilizer, potassium bacteria fertilizer, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th. In order to lay a good foundation for a greater harvest next year, Shanxi Province has launched a mass fertilizer accumulation campaign. As of now, the province has accumulated more than 459.27 million dan of fertilizer.

　　In the past half month, the fertilizer accumulation campaign in Shanxi Province has entered a climax. Many regions are organizing the masses to check existing fertilizer while promoting advanced experiences, opening up new fertilizer sources, and vigorously accumulating and producing fertilizer. In early October, Jincheng County held a mobile on-site meeting attended by leading cadres of various communes, visited Donggou, Zhoucun, Jin village and other communes where the fertilizer accumulation campaign was well done, and promoted the advanced experiences of these communes. Then the number of people participating in the shock fertilizer accumulation in the county increased to 80,000, setting off a fertilizer accumulation climax.

　　In order to ensure the smooth progress of the "Three Autumns" work, all people's communes have adopted a combination of professional teams and short-term shock tactics to vigorously engage in fertilizer accumulation, which not only guarantees the large amount of labor required for the "Three Autumns" work, but also ensures that fertilizer accumulation is completed on schedule.

　　Due to inconvenient transportation in the vast mountainous areas of Shanxi Province, fertilizer transportation occupies a lot of labor. Therefore, the people's communes in various mountainous areas have also promoted the method of fertilizer accumulation at the head of the field. Materials are collected locally for accumulation and used locally. Lishi County organized on-site visits and vigorously promoted the fertilizer accumulation experience of Jinluo Commune's "damming flood to compost mud pits," which was warmly welcomed by the vast number of commune members. At present, the county has already built 124,483 field composting pits, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached more than 50% of the county's planned amount, and the quality of fertilizer has also been greatly improved.

    为明年大丰收多积造优质肥
    安徽四川山西积极推广先进积肥经验增辟肥源
    据新华社合肥26日电　安徽省掀起秋季积肥运动。据最近统计，全省已积造各种农家肥料二百一十九亿多担。
    目前，很多山岗和湖滩，正是青草丛生落叶遍地的时候，各地都抓紧这一良好时机，大量沤制绿肥。芜湖专区开展了每人千斤草运动，全区有六十多万人，上山下湖割青草和捞水草。郎溪县各人民公社组织了割青草专业队，到湖滩和江堤边安营扎寨，大割青草。无为县每天出动四千一百多只船到湖里捞水草。到10月18日，全专区单是水草，已经捞了六十多亿斤。
    为了节省运肥劳力，提高积肥造肥工效，很多人民公社在田头挖了沤肥坑，就地沤制绿肥。
    各地在积肥运动中，还大烧土肥、挖沟塘泥和攒积人畜粪。阜阳专区组织了三万多个积肥专业队，除沤绿肥十三亿多担外，还烧了土肥二亿三千多万担，挖沟泥七亿多担，积人畜粪十六亿担，积土杂肥五亿八千多万担。蒙城县乐土公社85％的秋播田里都烧了土肥，这样，既增加了土壤肥效，又除去了杂草，消灭了病虫害。
    本报成都23日电　四川省农村三万多个土化肥厂掀起了生产高潮，为明年小春作物准备优质化肥。从9月1日到10月8日的三十八天中，据不完全统计，全省已制出土化肥二十二亿斤。
    大抓土化肥的运动是在全省农村各级党组织贯彻八届八中全会精神，反右倾、鼓干劲的形势下开展起来的。各地县委和公社党委在总结今年小春丰产经验时，都发动群众算需肥账、缺肥账，批判了松劲畏难情绪和右倾保守思想，使广大干部和群众认识到，没有质量高、肥效大的土化肥，就不能满足作物增产的需用。万县各公社在短时间内就有一千五百多个化肥厂投入生产，生产出土化肥一亿多斤；汉源县安乐人民公社抽出一百五十多人，大力恢复和发展土化肥的生产，短时间内制造出土化肥五百七十八万斤。许多地区还用社办工业的废物、废烟、废汽等回收利用，制出了土化肥，这些肥料成本低质量好，极受欢迎。
    在大搞土化肥运动中，各个专区和县办的土化肥厂也鼓足干劲，生产大量化肥来支援农村，仅乐山、绵阳、温江三个专区各个县的县办化肥厂就在10月以前生产了一万五千吨钙镁磷肥运到农村。许多县办的化肥厂还打破了发展化肥的神秘观点，克服了器材的困难，用土法制出质料高的化肥，如达县第一化肥厂职工用土法生产了胡散酸钠肥、磷细菌肥、钾细菌肥、固氮菌肥等十多种化肥。
    据新华社太原26日电　山西省为了给明年更大丰收打下良好的基础，掀起了群众性的积肥运动。截至目前为止，全省已积肥四亿五千九百二十七万多担。
    最近半月来，山西省积肥运动已经进入高潮。许多地区一边组织群众清查现有肥料，一边推广先进经验，开辟新的肥源，大力积肥造肥。晋城县在10月上旬召开了有各公社领导干部参加的流动现场会议，参观了积肥运动搞的好的东沟、周村、金村等公社，推广了这些公社的先进经验。接着全县参加突击积肥的人数增加到八万人，掀起了积肥高潮。
    为了保证“三秋”工作的顺利进展，各人民公社都采取了专业队伍和短期突击相结合的办法，大搞积肥，既保证了“三秋”工作需要的大量劳力，又保证了积肥按时完成计划。
    山西省广大山区由于交通不便，运肥占用劳力很多，因此各山区人民公社又推广了地头积肥法。就地取材积造，就地用。离石县组织现场参观，大力推广金罗公社“拦洪沤泥坑”的积肥经验，受到广大社员热烈欢迎，目前全县已经搞了十二万四千四百八十三个地头沤肥坑，积肥量达到全县计划数50％以上，肥料质量也有很大提高。
