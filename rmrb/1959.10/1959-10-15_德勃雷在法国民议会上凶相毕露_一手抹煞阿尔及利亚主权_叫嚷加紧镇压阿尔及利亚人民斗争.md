    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th: The French National Assembly began a three-day policy debate on the 13th. French Prime Minister Debre made a lengthy statement on behalf of the government at the start of the debate, mainly concerning policy towards Algeria.
    Debre's statement said that the only way out of the current situation in Algeria was to "restore the rule of law," which in no way meant recognizing Algerian sovereignty. He said, "Algerian sovereignty simply does not exist. It has never existed. All that Algerians currently possess and may possess in the coming generations can only be the unity created by France politically, morally, spiritually, and economically."
    Debre blatantly stated that France has absolutely no intention of abandoning its strategic position in Algeria and its colonialist plunder of the rich resources of the Sahara, thereby thoroughly exposing the complete hypocrisy of de Gaulle's promise in mid-September this year to allow Algerians to "freely" choose among three futures: "independence, autonomy, and complete integration into France."
    In his statement, Debre re-proposed de Gaulle's suggestion last October of so-called "negotiated ceasefires," which essentially demanded the unconditional surrender of Algerian national liberation fighters. He emphasized the "purely military nature" of the negotiations, insisting that "there is no room for discussion" other than "negotiating ceasefire measures related to the genuine abandonment of violence"; even de Gaulle's deceptive promise of "self-determination" could not serve as "the basis and content of negotiations."
    While reiterating the so-called "negotiated ceasefire" proposal, Debre revealed his hideous true colors, threatening to further intensify the suppression of the Algerian people's struggle for independence. He clamored that the French government was determined to step up its "pacification" actions in Algeria, and said that the fiscal budget for next year stipulates that France will maintain its troops stationed in Algeria at "maximum strength."
    In other parts of his statement, Debre also spoke about France's foreign policy. He said that the French government "favors holding a summit meeting," believing that such a meeting would provide "a great opportunity to achieve better understanding, thereby easing international tensions." He said, "France's position can be summarized in two points: first, the status quo of Germany should be maintained, and then problems that may lead to agreement should be found." Debre's statement also advocated strengthening European unity and the unity of the North Atlantic bloc. He said that, in Europe, the French government has stated that it is willing to abide by the obligations undertaken by previous French governments.

　　德勃雷在法国民议会上凶相毕露
    一手抹煞阿尔及利亚主权
    叫嚷加紧镇压阿尔及利亚人民斗争
    据新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会13日开始举行为期三天的政策辩论。法国总理德勃雷在辩论开始后代表政府作了长篇声明，主要谈的是对阿尔及利亚的政策。
    德勃雷的声明说，目前阿尔及利亚局势的唯一出路在于“恢复法治”，而这绝不意味着承认阿尔及利亚的主权。他说，“根本就不存在阿尔及利亚主权。它从来也不曾存在过。阿尔及利亚人目前所拥有以及在今后几个世代中所可能拥有的只能是由法国在政治、道义、精神和经济上所创立的统一。”
    德勃雷露骨地表示，法国绝不打算放弃它在阿尔及利亚的战略地位和对撒哈拉富源的殖民主义掠夺，从而彻底暴露了戴高乐今年9月中旬提出的所谓允许阿尔及利亚人在“独立、自治和完全并入法国”三种前途之中“自由”作出抉择的诺言的全部虚伪性。
    德勃雷在声明中重新提出了戴高乐去年10月提出的实质上是要求阿尔及利亚民族解放战士无条件投降的所谓“谈判停火”的建议。他强调谈判的“纯粹军事性”，坚持除了“谈判同真正放弃暴力有关的停火措施”之外，“没有任何讨论的余地”；甚至戴高乐关于“自决权”的欺骗性诺言都不能作为“谈判的基础和谈判的内容”。
    在重提所谓“谈判停火”建议的同时，德勃雷露出狰狞的真面目，威胁要更加紧镇压阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。他叫嚷说，法国政府决心加紧推行在阿尔及利亚的“绥靖”行动，并且说，明年度的财政预算规定法国把它驻在阿尔及利亚的军队维持“最大数量”。
    德勃雷在声明的其他部分还谈到了法国的对外政策。他说，法国政府“赞成举行最高级会议”，认为这样的会议将提供“一次取得更好谅解的巨大机会，从而缓和国际紧张局势”。他说，“法国的立场可以归结为这样两点：首先应维持德国的现状，然后寻找出有可能达成协议的问题。”德勃雷的声明还主张加强欧洲团结和北大西洋集团的团结。他说，在欧洲方面，法国政府已经表示它愿意遵守法国前几届政府所承担的义务。
