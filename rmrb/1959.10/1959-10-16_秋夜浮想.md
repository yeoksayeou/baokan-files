　　Autumn Night Thoughts
　　Xie Yi

　　Under the lamp, I opened and read a letter from my nephew in the countryside. There was this passage: "Old Grandpa next door was extremely happy today. He received two months' wages at once and went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy eight feet of blue cloth, saying he was going to make a cotton-padded coat. He also bought a new cotton quilt, and he was smiling all the way, saying to everyone he met, 'Here, here, touch it and see, try touching it, what a soft and fluffy quilt it is!' If people didn't look, he would stop them and not let them go."
    Old Grandpa used to be a lonely old man, making a living by carrying sedan chairs and doing odd jobs. His face was full of wrinkles, and he was a bit hunchbacked. He only started a family after the land reform, and life wasn't very good then. He hadn't bought new cotton clothes or a new cotton quilt for decades, but now he bought them all at once... Reading the letter, I was truly inexplicably happy. It's now the Mid-Autumn Festival, the night is cool as water, and the west wind is blowing coldly in from the window. I'm only wearing a single layer of clothing, but I don't feel cold. On the contrary, my heart is warm.
    Buying cotton quilts and making cotton clothes isn't just something Old Grandpa is doing, but millions upon millions of people. Such examples are reported a lot in the newspapers and can be seen everywhere. A few days ago, I went to Macun Brigade of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune in the suburbs of Nanning. This brigade is one of the poorer ones in the commune. Secretary Huang of the Party branch told me: "In the past, only 30% of the families in our brigade had cotton quilts for the winter. Now, hey, it's 100%. When there's a holiday, who doesn't put on new clothes and celebrate joyfully?"
    Ten years of hard work are now bearing fruit. People have basically freed themselves from the encroachment of hunger and cold and have entered a happy state of fullness and warmth. Ten years ago, from 1949 all the way back to the Tang and Song dynasties or even further, such a situation had never existed. Back then, it was: "My quilt has been cold and hard like iron for many years, my darling son sleeps badly and tears through the lining." (Du Fu: Song of the Thatched Roof Being Torn Apart by the Autumn Wind) Back then, it was: "The whole family is in the autumn wind, and the winter clothes have not yet been cut in the ninth month." (Huang Zhongze) Back then, it was: "The north wind is as sharp as a sword, and rags cannot cover the body." (Bai Juyi: Bitter Cold in a Village Dwelling) Back then, it was: "In the long summer days, I often go hungry, and on cold nights, I have no quilt to sleep under." (Tao Yuanming: A Complaint in the Chu Style Presented to Registrar Pang and Adjutant Deng) Back then, it was: "The road is lined with frozen corpses" (Du Fu). Enough, just these verses paint a bleak and painful picture of hunger and cold. Poor people trembled and groaned in the cold wind; they fell down in the snow. Despite constant changes of dynasties, with the Zhang family becoming emperors and then being replaced by the Li family, from Li Yuanhong to Chiang Kai-shek, the hunger and cold suffered by the poor never changed. They starved for thousands of years and froze for thousands of years.
    From 1949 onwards, we gradually began to change this human tragedy. By this year, we have only experienced ten years (actually less than ten years), and the situation has already changed greatly. Since ancient times, eating has been a major event, and so is clothing. Solving these major events is not easy. Think about it, 650 million people, each with a cotton coat, how much cotton and cloth would that require? Several cotton quilts per household, how many catties of cotton would the whole country need? Over the past ten years, on the one hand, production has developed and cotton production has increased. On the other hand, collectivization and the Great Leap Forward have raised people's awareness, given them enough energy, and increased their income. Therefore, we have basically changed the state of hunger and cold that had lasted for thousands of years in just ten years. This fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and demonstrates the powerful strength of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.
    "The soughing autumn wind blows again, but the world has changed!" (Chairman Mao: Lang Tao Sha) In the past, when a fallen autumn leaf dropped from a tree, people would worry about not having warm clothes. Therefore, the soughing autumn wind brought sadness and misery to the world. But now? It's all joy and happiness. Listen, isn't Old Grandpa grinning from ear to ear, and aren't the farmers in Macun bursting with joy? This is a great achievement that no one can deny or slander. People cherish this achievement as they cherish their own lives. People also understand that as long as they follow the path pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao and forge ahead bravely, they will surely have more abundant food and clothing and endless happiness. Now it is autumn again, but the world has changed. Even if the wind is as sharp as a sword and the snow is like a pointed knife, what can they do to me!

### 秋夜浮想

　　秋夜浮想
　　谢逸
　　灯下拆读侄儿从乡下寄来的信，里面有这么一段：“对门老和爷今天顶高兴，一次领了两个月的工资，就到供销部买了八尺蓝布，说是要做一件棉衣，还买了一张新棉被，一路上笑哈哈的，逢人就说：‘哪哪，你摸一摸看，试摸一摸看，多软熟的棉被哩’。人家不看，他硬拦着人家不给走。”
    老和爷从前是个寡老汉，抬轿、打零工过日子，满脸皱纹，还有些驼背，土改以后才成家，那时生活还不怎么好，几十年没有买过新棉衣新棉被，如今却一下子都买起来了……读着信，真是说不出的高兴，现在正是中秋，夜凉如水，西风从窗外冷嗖嗖的吹进来，我只穿着一件单衣，但并不觉得寒冷，反之，心里却是热呼呼的。
    买棉被做棉衣，并不只是老和爷一个人，而是千千万万个人。这样的事例，报上报道得很多，到处可以看见。前几天我到南宁郊区中苏友好公社麻村大队去走一趟，这个队是公社中比较差的一队，党支部黄书记对我说：“过去我们这个大队，只有30％的人家有棉被过冬，如今呢，嘿，是百分之百，过节放假，哪个又不穿上新衣裳，欢欢喜喜的？”
    十年的辛勤耕耘，现在是开花结果了，人们基本上摆脱了饥寒的侵袭，跨进了饱温的欢乐境地。而十年以前，从1949年直追溯到唐宋或者更远一些，都未曾有过这种情景。那时是：“布衾多年冷似铁，娇儿恶卧踏里裂。”（杜甫：茅屋为秋风所破歌）那时是：“全家都在秋风里，九月寒衣未剪裁。”（黄仲则）那时是：“北风利如剑，布絮不蔽身。”（白居易：村居苦寒）那时是：“夏日长抱饥，寒夜无被眠。”（陶渊明：怨诗楚调示庞主簿邓治中）那时是：“路有冻死骨”（杜甫）够了，就是这些诗句，已画出了一幅凄凉痛苦的饥寒图，穷苦人家是在寒风里颤抖呻吟，他们是在雪地里倒了下来。尽管不断的改朝换代，姓张的做了皇帝后来又换了姓李的，从黎元洪一直到蒋介石，但穷人的挨饥受冻，却一点也没有改变，饿了几千年，也寒了几千年。
    从1949年开始，就逐步的改变这一人间惨状，到今年，只不过经历了十年（其实不到十年）的时间，情况已经大变了。自古以来，吃饭是大事，穿衣也是大事，解决这一大事，并不是很容易的。你想，六亿五千万人，每人一件棉衣，该要多少棉，多少布？每户几张棉被，全国又该要多少斤棉花呢？十年来，一方面是生产发展了，棉花增产了，另方面是公社化和大跃进，人们觉悟提高，干劲足，收入也增加了。因此，几千年饥寒交迫的状态，我们用十年的时间就基本上使它改观了。这充分证明社会主义制度的无比优越性，也显示总路线、大跃进、人民公社的强大威力。
    “萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间！”（毛主席：浪淘沙）从前，一张秋叶从树上落下来，人们就为寒衣的无着而发愁，因此，萧瑟的秋风给人间带来了凄凄惨惨戚戚，而现在呢？却是欢欢喜喜。你听，老和爷不是在裂着咀巴大笑么，麻村的农民兄弟不是心花怒放么？这是伟大的成就，是任何人都不能加以抹杀和污蔑的，人们爱护这一成果，就像爱护自己的生命一样，人们也懂得，今后只要遵循着党和毛主席所指出的道路奋勇前进，就一定更加丰衣足食，其乐无穷的。现在又是秋风萧瑟的时候，但换了人间，即使真的风如利剑，雪似尖刀，那又岂奈我何！
