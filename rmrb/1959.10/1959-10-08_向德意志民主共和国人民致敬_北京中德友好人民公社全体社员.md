    A Salute to the People of the German Democratic Republic
    All Members of the Beijing China-Germany Friendship People's Commune
    On the joyous occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the members of our China-Germany Friendship People's Commune are filled with boundless excitement. We will forever remember Premier Grotewohl's visit to our commune on January 27th of this year, from which day our commune was honorably named "China-Germany Friendship People's Commune." This has given us tremendous encouragement.
    We are deeply grateful to our friends in the German Democratic Republic for their care and help. We are particularly moved that the staff of the German Democratic Republic Embassy in China and the students from the German Democratic Republic studying in our country come to our commune to participate in labor during holidays. Ambassador Wang Dael has also participated in labor in our horticultural team. Experts from the German Democratic Republic also spare no effort to help us repair tractors during their holidays. All of these have greatly encouraged our enthusiasm.
    Ten years is not a long time, but the world has undergone great changes. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and stronger, and the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. Take our commune, for example. Our commune was voluntarily merged in October 1958 after full discussion by more than 6,100 households of members from three advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. When the People's Commune was established, it quickly demonstrated unparalleled superiority. In 1958, we achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a grain harvest of 18.9 million jin, an average yield of 450 jin per mu, which is almost double the yield before collectivization. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, this year has continued to leap forward. The wheat harvest in the first half of the year reached 4.1 million jin, and there have been large areas of high yields. For example, the Louzizhuang management wheat professional team has 1,000 mu of wheat with an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu, of which one mu has a high yield of 1,014 jin.
    Now our commune has more than 27,000 people, more than 76,000 mu of land, two automobiles, eleven tractors, and more than 40 commune-run factories, such as agricultural product processing factories, farm tool repair factories, brick and tile factories, and so on. The total annual income of the commune is approximately 1.5 million yuan, cash income has also increased, and the income of commune members has further improved. There are 62 public canteens, more than 80 kindergartens and nurseries, and two homes for the elderly in the commune.
    We know that in the past ten year, the people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, have made brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism. All the members of our commune and the entire Chinese people regard these achievements as their own achievements and are proud of them.
    Today, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, all the members of our commune extend our warm congratulations and high respect to our brothers in the German Democratic Republic. Let us shout:
    Long live the fraternal friendship between the people of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic!

    向德意志民主共和国人民致敬
    北京中德友好人民公社全体社员
    在德意志民主共和国成立十周年的大喜的日子，我们中德友好人民公社的社员感到无比的兴奋。我们永远难忘的是，今年1月27日格罗提渥总理参观了我们公社，从那天起，我们公社就光荣地命名为“中德友好人民公社”。这给了我们极大的鼓舞。
    我们非常感谢德意志民主共和国的朋友们对我们的关怀和帮助，令人十分感动的是，德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆的工作人员和德意志民主共和国在我国的留学生，在假日的时候到我们公社参加劳动，汪戴尔大使也参加过我们园田工作队里的劳动。德意志民主共和国的专家们也不辞劳苦地利用假日来帮助我们修理拖拉机。所有这些，都大大鼓舞了我们的干劲。
    十年的时间并不算长，但是世界已经起了很大的变化，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营越来越强，东风继续压倒西风。我们的国家在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，日益繁荣富强。就拿我们公社来说吧，我们公社是1958年10月经过三个高级农业生产合作社六千一百多户社员充分讨论后自愿合并起来的。当人民公社成立后，很快就显示出无比的优越性，1958年我们获得了空前的大丰收，粮食收获量达到一千八百九十万斤，每亩平均产量合四百五十斤，这比公社化以前的产量增长将近一倍。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又继续跃进，上半年小麦收获量达四百一十万斤，并且出现了大面积丰产。例如我们楼梓庄管理小麦专业队就有一千亩小麦每亩产量平均达四百多斤，其中有一亩高产一千零十四斤。
    现在我们公社有二万七千多人、七万六千多亩土地、两部汽车、十一台拖拉机，还有社办工厂四十多所，如农产品加工厂、农具修造厂、砖瓦厂等等。全社一年收入约计一百五十万元，现金收入也增加了，社员收入也进一步得到改善。社里有六十二个公共食堂，八十多个幼儿园和托儿所，还有两所敬老院。
    我们知道，十年来，德意志民主共和国人民，在德国统一社会党的领导下，在建设社会主义的事业中取得了辉煌的成就。我们公社的全体社员和全中国人民，都把这种成就看成是自己的成就，并且为此感到自豪。
    今天，在德意志民主共和国十年大庆的日子，我们公社全体社员衷心地向德意志民主共和国的兄弟们致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青！
