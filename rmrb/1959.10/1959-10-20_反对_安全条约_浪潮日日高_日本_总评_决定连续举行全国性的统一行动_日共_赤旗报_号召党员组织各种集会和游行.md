Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with 3.6 million members, decided today to hold the 8th and 9th nationwide unified actions on or around November 27th and December 10th respectively, to prevent the Kishida Nobusuke government from revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　This decision was made at a meeting of leading cadres of the largest trade union in Tokyo. According to the decision, Sohyo will develop a nationwide struggle in the next two months as a preparatory step for a general offensive against monopoly capital. In the struggle, it will strive to overthrow the Kishida Nobusuke government and force the Liberal Democratic Party government to completely change its policies.

　　The slogans proposed by Sohyo also include: preventing the government from revising the "Security Treaty," opposing the "enterprise rationalization" of the coal industry, opposing unemployment and demanding full employment, raising wages, implementing a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 8,000 yen, and providing relief to disaster victims.

　　The meeting also decided that Sohyo should fully support the Japan Coal Miners' Union, which is taking the lead in fighting against "enterprise rationalization," and strive for the victory of the coal miners' struggle in order to strike a blow at the government and monopoly capital.

　　This nationwide trade union organization also decided to lead its local organizations to establish close relations with people from all walks of life in order to hold rallies and carry out mass activities in various regions; and to hold a large-scale conference in Tokyo in mid-November, attended by representatives from various regions, in order to exert pressure on the government and the Diet. Sohyo will also hold large-scale mass rallies in Hokkaido on November 7th and in Kyushu on November 8th to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," support the struggle of coal miners, and oppose unemployment.

　　According to the decision, Sohyo will cooperate with the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, and the National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations to hold lectures on the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the issue of "enterprise rationalization" throughout the country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on all JCP members to fight for the victory of the 7th nationwide unified action to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which will be launched on October 20th.

　　The editorial pointed out that Japanese monopoly capital and the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet are attempting to revive imperialism as quickly as possible by revising the "Security Treaty" while subordinating themselves to the United States, and at the same time launching an even more barbaric offensive against the working class. The editorial pointed out that the 7th nationwide unified action held under these circumstances is of great significance and must be regarded as the starting point for launching larger-scale struggles by the masses. The editorial said that this struggle is an important struggle being carried out simultaneously with the international joint action month launched by various countries to prevent nuclear armament.

　　The editorial called on all JCP members to widely and deeply publicize the significance of this unified action, and strive for the successful holding of various rallies and parades in the central and local areas, while striving to develop joint actions of democratic forces including the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party through unified action, and to fight for further launching large-scale struggles of the masses centered on opposing the "Security Treaty."

    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会今天决定在11月27日和12月10日或前后分别举行第八次和第九次全国性统一行动，阻止岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”。
    这个全国最大的工会在东京举行的领导干部会议上作出了这个决定。根据决定，总评议会在最近两个月内将发展全国性的斗争，作为反对垄断资本的总攻势的准备步骤，并且在斗争中要争取打倒岸信介政府和迫使自由民主党的政府全面改变它的政策。
    总评议会提出的斗争口号中还包括：阻止政府修改“安全条约”，反对煤炭工业实行“企业合理化”，反对失业和要求完全就业，提高工资，实行全国统一的最低工资为八千日元的制度，救济灾民等。
    会议还决定，总评议会要全力支持正在率先为反对“企业合理化”而斗争的日本煤矿工会，并且要努力争取煤矿工人斗争的胜利，以便给政府和垄断资本以打击。
    这个全国性的工会联合组织还决定领导它的地方组织同各界人民建立密切的关系，以便在各地区举行集会和展开群众活动；在11月中旬在东京举行大规模的由各地代表参加的大会，以便向政府和国会施加压力。总评议会还将于11月7日在北海道、11月8日在九州举行大规模的群众集会，来反对修改“安全条约”、支持煤矿工人的斗争和反对失业。
    根据决定，总评议会将同阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议、拥护宪法国民联合会、恢复日中邦交国民会议合作，在全国各地举行关于修改“安全条约”和“企业合理化”问题的演讲会。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论号召日共全体党员为争取在10月20日展开的阻止修改日美“安全条约”第七次全国统一行动的胜利而奋斗。
    社论指出，日本垄断资本和岸信介内阁企图在从属于美国的情况下通过修改“安全条约”来尽速地复活帝国主义，同时对工人阶级发动更加蛮横的进攻。社论指出，在这种情况下举行的第七次全国统一行动具有重要意义，必须把它当作掀起人民群众更大规模斗争的起点。社论说，这次斗争是和世界各国展开的阻止核武装国际共同行动月活动同时进行的一个重要斗争。
    社论号召日共全体党员广泛和深入地宣传这次统一行动的意义，并且努力争取在中央和地方成功地举行各种集会和游行，同时通过统一行动争取发展包括日本共产党和社会党在内的民主力量的共同行动，并且为进一步掀起以反对“安全条约”为中心的人民群众的大规模斗争而奋斗。
