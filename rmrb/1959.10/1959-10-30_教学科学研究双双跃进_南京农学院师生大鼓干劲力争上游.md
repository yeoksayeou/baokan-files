Teaching and Scientific Research Leap Forward Together
Nanjing Agricultural College Faculty and Students Drum Up Enthusiasm and Strive for the Top

(Our report) Nanjing Agricultural College's more than five thousand faculty and students, encouraged by the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have launched a surge of "opposing rightism, boosting enthusiasm, and striving in every way to improve teaching quality." Teachers are now earnestly preparing lessons, lecturing diligently, providing careful tutoring, diligently grading homework, and administering examinations conscientiously. For example, Professor Huang Qilin, head of the Plant Protection Department, has been teaching "Entomology" for thirty-nine years. This semester, he is responsible for teaching "Insect Taxonomy" to the graduating class and originally planned to compile teaching materials while lecturing. However, when the Party committee issued the call to "boost enthusiasm, seize the time, and ensure the availability of teaching materials before the start of the semester," he immediately responded. After a period of hard work, he completed the teaching materials before the start of classes. Professor Huang Qilin constantly supplements his lectures with new information from domestic and international literature and selects intuitive teaching materials. When he lectured on the "molting of scale insects," he repeated it twice, but the students still could not fully understand it. After class, he immediately went deep into the students to understand the situation, identified the key problems, and then conducted a third lecture. The Chemistry Teaching and Research Group of the Agricultural Chemistry Department, with the whole group participating, organized the content of the textbook, identified the problems that students found most difficult to understand in previous lectures, and used the method of preparing tasks through division of labor, individual trial lectures, and group discussions to improve the quality of lectures. Some teachers went to the classes they were teaching to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation and provide timely guidance, which was warmly welcomed by the students.

Under the slogan of "opposing rightism and boosting enthusiasm," the scientific research work of the college has taken a great leap forward. The research on "swine enzootic pneumonia" (swine viral pneumonia), led by Vice President and animal husbandry expert Professor Luo Qingsheng of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department, had once stalled. Recently, Vice President Luo convened a forum for teachers participating in this research and decided to resume the research work immediately. In addition to completing the publication of the "Research on Swine Enzootic Pneumonia" collection of papers before National Day, they have so far conducted a total of twenty-nine research trials involving seven major categories of seventeen kinds of Western medicines, ten kinds of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, acupuncture therapy, and lactic acid-anise oil vapor inhalation therapy, and have reached preliminary conclusions. The Agronomy Department is conducting large-scale research trials on more than one hundred mu of land, including selection, seedling cultivation, high yield, and crop king cultivation. After completing the "National Wheat Variety Classification Research" before National Day, they proposed a new and ambitious plan. On relatively barren land on campus, they have set a goal of achieving a wheat yield of 800 jin per mu, striving for 1,000 jin, and a rapeseed yield of 600 jin per mu, striving for 800 jin. Currently, nearly a thousand people in the department are working hard on seed selection, fertilizer accumulation, and land preparation, striving to complete this year's autumn sowing tasks ahead of schedule to create conditions for next year's bumper harvest. In their three-year plan, they also proposed to select and breed ten new varieties suitable for Jiangsu Province and southern regions that have significant economic significance and practical value for production. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the faculty and students of the Plant Protection Department have proposed six major research projects. The research plan has now been drawn up, and the tasks have been specifically assigned to individuals.

The students of this college, during their participation in manual labor, deeply felt their lack of knowledge, and therefore have a strong desire to learn. Now, each class is engaged in production labor and scientific research on the land within the school grounds, while also studying diligently. According to a survey of some classes in the Soil Chemistry Department, 93.1% of the students achieved excellent or good grades in the periodic tests.

    教学科学研究双双跃进
    南京农学院师生大鼓干劲力争上游
    本报讯　南京农学院五千多名师生，在党的八届八中全会决议精神鼓舞下，掀起了“反右倾、鼓干劲、千方百计提高教学质量”的热潮。教师们在教学中做到了认真备课、认真讲课、认真辅导、认真批改作业和认真考试。如植物保护系主任黄其林教授，教了三十九年的“昆虫学”，这学期他担任应届毕业班的“昆虫分类学”的讲课任务，本来是打算边讲课边编讲义的。但当党委提出“鼓干劲，抢时间，保证开学前拿出讲义”号召以后，他立即响应，经过一番奋斗，在开课以前编完了讲义。黄其林教授在讲课中不断补充国内外文献上的新资料，选直观教材，他讲“介壳虫脱皮”一节时，反复讲了两遍，同学仍不能彻底弄懂，下课以后，他马上深入学生中了解情况，找出了症结问题，又进行第三次课堂讲授。农化系化学教研组，全组动手，将教材内容排了队，找出了历次在讲课中学生最难理解的问题，用分工准备、个人试讲、全组讨论的办法，来提高讲课质量。有些教师到任课班级中去，深入了解情况，及时辅导，受到了同学们的热烈欢迎。
    在“反右倾、鼓干劲”的口号下，该学院科学研究工作向前跃进了一大步。畜牧兽医系由副院长、畜医专家罗清生教授主持的“猪喘气病”（猪病毒性肺炎）的研究工作，过去一度停顿，最近罗副院长又召集参加这项研究工作的教师座谈，决定把研究工作立刻恢复了起来。除在国庆以前完成了“猪喘气病的研究”论文集出刊以外，到目前为止，他们共进行了七大项十七种西药、十种中药方、针灸疗法和乳酸按叶油蒸气吸入疗法共二十九种的研究试验，并已初步得出了结论。农学系正在进行一百多亩大规模的包括选种、育苗、丰产和作物王培育等研究试验，他们在国庆前完成“全国小麦品种分类研究”以后，又提出了新的宏伟的规划。在校园内比较瘠薄的土地上，他们提出了小麦亩产八百斤，争取一千斤，油菜亩产六百斤争取八百斤的奋斗目标。目前全系近千人正在大搞选种、积肥和整地工作，力争提前完成今年秋播任务，为明年丰产创造条件。他们在三年规划中还提出要选育出适合于江苏省和南方地区的具有重大经济意义和生产实践价值的十个新品种。植物保护系师生在党总支领导下，提出了六大研究项目，现在研究计划已经订出，任务也具体分配到人。
    这个学院的学生在下放劳动中，深感知识之不足，因此都有强烈的学习要求。现在，每个班级一方面在学校园内的土地上从事生产劳动、科学研究，另方面认真读书。据土化系一部分班级调查，阶段测验，优良成绩者占93.1％。
