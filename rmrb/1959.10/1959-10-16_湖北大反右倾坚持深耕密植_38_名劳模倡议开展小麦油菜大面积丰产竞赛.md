Hubei Opposes Right Deviation and Insists on Deep Ploughing and Close Planting
38 Model Workers Propose a Large-Scale High-Yield Competition for Wheat and Rapeseed

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, October 15th) The broad masses of rural people in Hubei Province are sweeping away right-leaning tendencies and holding high the red flag of "Carrying the Technical Revolution Through to the End." The province's winter sowing preparations are good, progress is fast, and quality is high. The province originally planned a winter sowing area of 45 million mu, but after large-scale opposition to right-leaning tendencies and boosting of energy in various regions, and mobilizing the masses, the winter sowing area has been expanded to 46.82 million mu (including green manure), an increase of more than 13 million mu compared to last year. In most areas, rapeseed, green manure, and minor spring grains have basically completed sowing; wheat, which accounts for nearly half of the winter sowing area, is now in full swing.

During the winter sowing preparations, some conservative ideas emerged in some areas of Hubei. Leaders at all levels and the masses launched a major ideological debate against the right-leaning conservative arguments on the issue of deep ploughing, educating the broad masses of cadres and people, strengthening their confidence, and initiating a high tide of vigorously engaging in deep ploughing. For example, Xiangyang Prefecture originally planned to deep plough 8 million mu of land, but after the mass movement to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost energy, and vigorously engage in the technical revolution, the result was the deep ploughing of 10.46 million mu.

Various localities have continued to implement the opposition to right-leaning tendencies and boosted energy during sowing, so the winter sowing work continues to achieve victory. During sowing, some people did not pay much attention to seizing the time for sowing, saying, "The beans are only turning yellow, there's no need to rush to sow." Others opposed advanced measures such as row planting with close spacing and applying sufficient base fertilizer, emphasizing that this year's winter sowing area is large and labor is tight, and if the requirements are too high, sowing cannot be completed on time. In response to these situations, all parts of the province have further mobilized the masses to extensively launch a fierce debate on "Which can increase production: early sowing or late sowing, reasonable close planting or sparse planting, applying fertilizer or not applying fertilizer?" This rebutted right-leaning conservative ideas and quickly set off a full-scale sowing upsurge of seizing the time for sowing, sowing quickly, and sowing well. Leaders at all levels and activists among the masses first created "model fields" and "demonstration fields" at each level at the beginning of sowing, setting up examples of comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and adhering to technical reforms, and then promoted them comprehensively through on-site visits and evaluations.

This year, Hubei Province's winter sowing task is very arduous, not only has the sowing area been expanded by more than 40% compared to last year (including newly reclaimed land), but also, starting from deep ploughing, it has been carried out in drought conditions for a long time. People's communes in various localities have formed strong deep ploughing labor armies, reformed deep ploughing tools, boosted energy, and overcome all difficulties, completing the task of deep ploughing land which was both larger and better than last year as scheduled. For example, various communes in Zao Yang County vigorously carried out land leveling and the development of garden-style fields, planning to connect more than 900,000 mu of wheat land into continuous pieces, of which 320,000 mu have been made into garden-style fields. In order to achieve balanced production increases, the communes of Zhongxiang County organized more than 1,200 "expedition teams" and "shock teams" to vigorously transform backward fields in remote hilly areas.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 15th) Thirty-eight well-known agricultural labor models from Hubei Province who returned to Beijing after participating in the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, gathered on the 13th. Under the auspices of the Provincial Party Committee, after heated discussions, they issued a proposal to the people's communes and the broad masses of commune members throughout the province, proposing to launch a winter sowing production competition to strive for a large-scale high-yield in next year's summer harvest.

The main high-yield competition indicators they proposed are: On the basis of striving for balanced production increases and comprehensive harvests of winter-sown crops, vigorously carry out large-scale high yields of 1,000 jin per mu for wheat and 500 jin per mu for rapeseed, and focus on creating high-yields of 3,000 jin per mu for wheat and 1,000 jin per mu for rapeseed. Based on their own rich production experience, they specifically put forward the following five measures for increasing production and competition:

1.  Resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, thoroughly criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, comprehensively and practically implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and carry the technical revolution through to the end. In winter sowing, strive to expand the sowing area, ensure the quality of sowing, and greatly increase the yield per unit area and the total yield, and fire the first shot for a bumper summer harvest next year. At the same time, vigorously carry out experiments on 1,000-jin high-yield mu, fields, plains, and hills for wheat, as well as experiments on 1,000-jin high-yield teams and 1,000-jin high-yield communes, and vigorously carry out experiments on 500-jin mu, fields, plains, and hills for rapeseed, as well as 500-jin teams and 500-jin communes.

2.  Resolutely eliminate backward fields and achieve large-scale balanced production increases. Strive to double the total summer harvest output in 1960 compared to the total summer harvest output in 1959.

3.  Propose that each commune and each production team plant three to five mu of high-yield experimental fields of wheat with a yield of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu; plant two to three mu of high-yield experimental fields of summer harvest miscellaneous grain crops with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu; and plant one, two, or three mu of high-yield experimental fields of rapeseed with a yield of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu. Every commune member should use vacant land to cultivate rapeseed kings, wheat kings, barley kings, and broad bean and pea kings, without hindering regular field production.

4.  Resolutely implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" for increasing agricultural production, boldly carry out technological innovations, and actively promote all advanced measures for increasing production.

5.  Immediately launch a vigorous and solid production competition movement centered on winter sowing throughout the province. The backward catch up with the advanced, the poor teams catch up with the rich teams, miscellaneous grains catch up with staple grains, mountain and hilly areas catch up with plains, and the plains move forward even further. You chase me, we organize collaboration, learn from each other, support each other, achieve a comprehensive harvest, and advance together. From now on, we must also vigorously carry out water conservancy construction, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, vigorously carry out land leveling, vigorously carry out soil improvement, vigorously carry out tool reform, and vigorously carry out mass technical innovations.

　　湖北大反右倾坚持深耕密植
    38名劳模倡议开展小麦油菜大面积丰产竞赛
    本报武汉15日电　湖北省广大农村群众横扫右倾，高举“把技术革命进行到底”的红旗，全省冬播准备好、进度快、质量高。全省原计划冬播面积为四千五百万亩，经过各地大反右倾、大鼓干劲，发动群众，冬播面积已扩大到四千六百八十二万亩（包括绿肥），比去年扩大一千三百多万亩。大部地区油菜、绿肥和小春杂粮，已经基本结束播种；占冬播面积将近半数的小麦正在全面突击播种。
    在冬播准备中，湖北部分地区曾出现了一些保守思想。各级领导和群众针对在深翻问题上的右倾保守论调，展开了思想大辩论，教育了广大干部和群众，坚定信心，掀起了大闹深翻的高潮。如襄阳专区原计划深翻八百万亩地，经过群众性反右倾、鼓干劲，大闹技术革命，结果深翻了一千零四十六万亩。
    各地在播种中仍然不断贯彻了反右倾鼓干劲，因此冬播工作继续取得胜利。在播种中，有的人很不注意抢时播种，说“豆子才发黄，播种不用忙”。还有人反对条播密植、施足底肥等先进措施，他们强调说今年冬播面积大、劳力紧，如果要求高了就不能按时播种。针对这些情况，全省各地又进一步发动群众，广泛展开了以“早播与迟播、合理密植与稀植、施肥与不施肥，究竟哪样能增产？”的一场剧烈的大辩论，驳倒了右倾保守思想，迅速掀起了抢时播种、种快、种好的全面播种高潮。各级领导干部和群众中的积极分子，在播种开始首先层层搞出“样板田”、“示范田”，树立全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”、坚持技术改革的榜样，然后通过现场参观评比，全面推广。
    今年，湖北省的冬播任务十分艰巨，不仅在播种面积上比去年扩大了40％以上（包括新开荒地），而且从深翻开始，很长时间是在抗旱中进行的。各地人民公社组成兵强马壮的深翻劳动大军，改革深翻工具，鼓干劲，排万难，如期完成了比去年又多又好的深翻土地任务。如枣阳县各公社大搞土地平整，大搞园田化，计划使九十多万亩麦地连成片，其中实现园田化已有三十二万亩。钟祥县各公社为了做到平衡增产，组织了一千二百多个“远征队”、“突击队”，到边远岗地大力改造落后田。
    据新华社武汉15日电　湖北省到北京参加庆祝建国十周年大典归来的三十八名著名农业劳动模范，13日集会，在省委主持下，经过热烈讨论，向全省人民公社和广大社员发出了倡议书，倡议开展冬播生产竞赛，争取明年夏收大面积丰产。
    他们提出的主要丰产竞赛指标是：在争取冬播作物平衡增产、全面丰收的基础上，大搞小麦亩产千斤、油菜亩产五百斤的大面积丰产，和重点创造小麦亩产三千斤、油菜亩产千斤的高额丰产。他们根据自己的丰富的生产经验，具体提出了以下五项增产和竞赛措施：
    一、坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，彻底批判与克服右倾保守思想，全面地切实地执行农业“八字宪法”，把技术革命进行到底。在冬播中，力争扩大播种面积，保证播种质量，大大提高单位面积产量和总产量，打响明年夏季作物丰收的第一炮。同时，大搞小麦千斤丰产亩、畈、冲、岗，以及千斤丰产队、千斤丰产公社的试验，大搞油菜五百斤亩、畈、冲、岗，以及五百斤队、五百斤公社的试验。
    二、坚决消灭落后田，达到大面积平衡增产。争取1960年夏收总产量比1959年夏收总产量翻一番。
    三、倡议每个公社、每个生产队都种三、五亩亩产二千斤到三千斤的小麦高产试验田；种两三亩亩产二千斤的高产夏收杂粮作物试验田；种一、二、三亩油菜亩产八百斤到一千斤的高产试验田。每个社员都利用空地，在不妨碍正田生产的情况下，培育油菜王、小麦王、大麦王、蚕豆豌豆王。
    四、坚决贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”，大胆进行技术革新，积极推行一切先进增产措施。
    五、在全省范围内立即开展一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的以冬播为中心的各项生产竞赛运动。落后赶先进，穷队赶富队，杂粮赶主粮，山地岗地赶平原，平原更向前，你追我赶，组织协作，互相学习，互相支援，达到全面丰收，共同跃进。从现在起，还要大搞水利建设，大搞积肥，大搞土地平整，大搞土壤改良，大搞工具改革，大搞群众性的技术革新。
