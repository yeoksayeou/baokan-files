According to Fujian Daily: The mountainous Guangze County in northern Fujian Province reports a great harvest of single-season late rice. The county has already harvested more than 43,000 mu, with a general increase in production of 15% compared to last year. Many large areas of high-yield fields have emerged.

The characteristic of this year's bumper harvest of late rice in Guangze is that many low-yield areas have achieved significant increases in production. Pai Xia Brigade of Zhimagong Commune had historically low yields. This year, one low-yield field achieved an average yield of 410 jin per mu, more than doubling production, and two and a half mu of land achieved a yield of 1,150 jin per mu. Weijiatang Production Team of Gongtun Brigade of Huaqiao Commune is also a well-known low-yield area. This year, the already harvested 150 mu achieved an average yield of 410 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of nearly 40% compared to last year.

Guangze County's great harvest of single-season late rice is the result of further implementing the Party's General Line, fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Communes, and conscientiously implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for agricultural production. The Hejiali Production Team of Siqian Commune has always relied on rainwater irrigation for its 45 mu of mountain fields in Miaozilong and other places. They were often affected by drought, and yields were very low. This year, with the help of the commune, they built a large water channel of more than ten zhang, overcame the threat of drought, and the average yield of late rice reached 500 jin per mu, an increase of 42.8% compared to last year. In the past, the Weijialong Production Team of Huaqiao Commune had low yields because of insufficient cattle power and crude plows and harrows. This year, the commune transferred 81 head of cattle and a group of plowmen from other teams to support this team, enabling the team's 960 mu of land to be plowed and harrowed carefully. This year, the average yield of late rice reached 410 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year. (Attached picture)

　　贯彻总路线贯彻八字宪法
    光泽四万亩晚稻丰收
    据福建日报消息　福建省北部山区光泽县传来单季晚稻大丰收的捷报。全县已收割四万三千多亩，普遍比去年增产一成半，并出现了许多大面积丰产田。
    今年光泽晚稻丰收的特点是，许多低产地区都取得显著的增产。止马公社排下大队历年产量很低，今年有一片低产田平均亩产达到四百一十斤，增产一倍多，并有二亩半田地亩产达到一千一百五十斤。华桥公社宫屯大队危家塘生产队也是个著名的低产区，今年已收的一百五十亩平均亩产干谷四百一十斤，比去年增产近四成。
    光泽县单季晚稻获得大丰收，是进一步贯彻党的总路线，充分发挥人民公社优越性，认真贯彻农业生产八字宪法的结果。司前公社何家里生产队在庙子垅等处的四十五亩山田，一向依靠天水灌溉，经常受旱，产量很低，今年在公社的帮助下，修了一条十多丈的大水圳，战胜了干旱威胁，晚稻平均亩产五百斤，比去年增产42.8％。华桥公社危家垅生产队过去因为牛力不足，犁耙粗糙，产量很低，今年公社由其他队调来八十一头耕牛和一批犁手，支援这个队，使这个队的九百六十亩田普遍作到精犁细耙，今年晚稻亩产平均达到四百一十斤，比去年增产40％。（附图片）
