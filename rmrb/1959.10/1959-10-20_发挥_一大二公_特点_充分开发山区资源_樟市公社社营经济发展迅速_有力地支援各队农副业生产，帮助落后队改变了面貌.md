Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th - Reporter Zheng Shiwen reports: The development of production and the strengthening of economic power of the collectively owned production units of Zhangshi People's Commune in Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, have powerfully supported the all-round leap forward in agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production of various production teams and the various constructions of the commune, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune.

Currently, the production units owned by the Zhangshi People's Commune at the commune level include large-scale semi-mechanized logging yards and stone quarries, lime factories, forestry and sideline product processing factories, hydroelectric power stations, and other twelve enterprises that comprehensively develop and utilize various mountain resources; there are also livestock and poultry breeding farms, nurseries, farms (serving as large-scale high-yield demonstration bases and meeting the grain needs of employees of enterprises directly under the commune), and four specialized teams for infrastructure construction, transportation, fishing, and sideline occupations. From January to September this year, the total income from diversified operations of these production units directly under the commune reached more than 1,520,000 yuan, which is 80% more than the total annual income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries of the original nineteen agricultural cooperatives in 1957 before communization.

The collectively owned production units of the Zhangshi Commune, especially the twelve enterprises that develop mountain resources, were established relying on the superiority of the People's Commune. This commune is composed of nineteen advanced agricultural cooperatives, and the area under its jurisdiction includes mountainous, hilly, and plain areas. The characteristics of the mountainous area are more cultivated land, more mountain forests, fewer people, and difficult transportation. Before communization, the ten mountainous agricultural cooperatives were already struggling to manage grain production alone, and it was difficult to spare effort to develop and utilize mountain resources. On the other hand, the nine agricultural cooperatives located in hilly and plain areas, although with more labor, lacked natural resources for development. Therefore, the income from diversified operations of each agricultural cooperative was not high. In order to solve this problem, in April last year, the nineteen agricultural cooperatives jointly formed a joint cooperative (the prototype of the commune) and began to develop mountain resources and engage in diversified operations through joint management. As soon as the Zhangshi Commune was established, it immediately opened up seven roads totaling eighty li in the mountains and established hydroelectric processing plants, freeing up a large amount of labor that had been carrying goods around the winding mountain roads for years and the labor of manual grain milling, paving the way for better development of diversified mountain operations. Subsequently, under the principles of unified planning, unified utilization of resources, and unified arrangement of labor, the commune drew appropriate labor from major teams to form an army of more than 1,200 people to develop mountain resources (including more than 780 people drawn from the major teams, accounting for only 7% of the original agricultural labor of the major teams, and the rest were skilled workers such as ironworkers, carpenters, and masons from the market towns), and built the above-mentioned twelve enterprises.

Due to good management, the collectively owned enterprises and various production units have achieved great production achievements. From January to September this year, the total income from diversified operations of these directly affiliated production units of the commune was 23% more than the total income from industrial and agricultural production of all production brigades in the commune from January to July. Among the diversified operations of the commune's directly affiliated units, the production of timber, semi-finished wood products, charcoal, limestone, and lime is the largest. They can also produce trailers and carriages for automobiles in batches, continuously providing raw materials and products needed for industrial and agricultural construction for the state and the commune itself. Due to the developed diversified operations at the commune level and the increasingly strong economic strength of the commune, the commune has invested 340,000 yuan this year to purchase a batch of machinery and power equipment, and currently owns four tractors, two trucks, one steamboat, and thirteen power machines and lathes, creating preliminary conditions for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification in the entire commune.

The rapid growth of the commune-run economy in Zhangshi Commune has in turn vigorously supported the production of all production teams in the commune. Due to the continuous supply of chicks and piglets from the commune's livestock and poultry breeding farms, the livestock and poultry breeding industries of various production teams and commune members have developed significantly. At the end of September this year, the number of pigs in stock in major brigades increased by 22% compared with the same period last year, and the number of chickens, ducks, and geese in stock increased by 70% compared with the same period last year. Due to the development of large-scale diversified operations under communal ownership, the avenues for sideline occupations in major and small teams are unprecedentedly broad. At present, the automobile and steamboat transportation network equipped by the commune undertakes the transportation tasks of various production teams and carries raw materials for processing by the teams; the various large-scale enterprises of the commune need commune members to provide a large amount of raw materials. Therefore, under the principle of "major efforts in slack seasons and minor efforts in busy seasons," the commune can arrange various sideline production tasks for the teams at any time. With such favorable conditions, the income from diversified operations of major brigades has increased significantly. From January to July this year alone, the total income from diversified operations of major brigades reached 376,000 yuan, which is more than 40,000 yuan more than the total income from diversified operations of various advanced cooperatives in 1957 before communization.

Agricultural production in various production teams has also made leaps forward with the backing of the commune's economic strength and the support of diversified operations. This year, the commune-level production units produced more than 2,000 tons of lime and more than 1 million jin of granular fertilizer. The commune also purchased more than 100,000 jin of chemical fertilizer to support the agricultural production of various brigades. At the same time, the commune also organized large-scale cooperation among various production brigades under the principle of equivalent exchange. As a result, the summer grain production of major brigades this year achieved balanced growth, and the total summer grain output of the entire commune increased by 15.7% compared with the same period last year. At present, the 37,800 mu of late rice (700 mu more than the same period last year) in major brigades has begun to be irrigated and hang their heads, and the seedlings are growing generally better than last year, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

Thanks to the strong support of the commune-run economy, the six formerly economically backward production brigades of the Zhangshi Commune have also changed their appearance and gradually caught up with the rich teams. For example, Guangming Brigade used to suffer from severe drought, resulting in low grain output and few sideline occupations. Before the establishment of the commune, it owed the state a loan of 40,000 yuan. After communization, the commune party committee organized more than 2,000 people to assist the team in repairing water conservancy facilities, alleviating drought, and as a result, the early rice harvest this year was abundant, with the total output increasing from 550,000 jin last year to 800,000 jin. The commune also helped the team establish a brick and tile factory, a lime factory, a poultry and livestock farm, and regularly assigned timber transportation tasks to increase sideline income. From April to August this year, the net income from industry and sideline occupations of this team has reached 15,000 yuan. In addition to paying wages on a monthly basis, it also saved 6,500 yuan. The average monthly wage per labor force in the entire team is 5.2 yuan, catching up with the wage level of the entire commune.

With the development of the commune-run diversified operations and the promotion of the all-round leap forward in the production of various production teams, the public accumulation at the commune level has now reached 910,000 yuan, which is more than six times the cumulative total of public accumulation in the past three years of primary cooperatives and advanced cooperatives. Another result of the increasingly strong public accumulation of the commune is that the collective welfare undertakings such as culture, education, and health of the entire commune are being run better and more extensively. The commune has newly established a junior high school, two senior primary schools, twenty-eight kindergartens, and one hundred and six nurseries, and all school-age children in the commune have entered school. In terms of cultural life, a broadcasting station has been added, and more than 380 wired broadcasting loudspeakers have been added. The film projection team and amateur cultural troupe have also been established. The commune has also newly built a commune central hospital with sixty beds, two branches, five medical stations, and seventeen maternity hospitals, and implemented free medical care for all commune members.

　　发挥“一大二公”特点　充分开发山区资源
    樟市公社社营经济发展迅速
    有力地支援各队农副业生产，帮助落后队改变了面貌
    据新华社广州19日电　记者郑世文报道：广东省韶关市樟市人民公社社有生产单位生产的发展和经济力量的壮大，有力地支援了各生产队农林牧副渔业各项生产的全面跃进和公社的各项建设，充分显示了人民公社的无比优越性。
    现在，樟市人民公社社一级所有的生产单位，有采伐、运输半机械化的大型伐木场和打石场、石灰厂、林副产品加工厂、水电站等十二项综合开发利用山区多种资源的企业，有畜牧种苗场、苗圃场、农场（作为大面积高产示范基地和解决公社直属企业职工的粮食需要）和基建、运输、捕鱼、副业等四个专业队。这些公社直属的生产单位，今年1月到9月，多种经营总收入共达一百五十二万多元，比公社化前1957年原十九个农业社的全年林牧副渔总收入还多80％。
    樟市公社社有的生产单位，特别是开发山区资源的十二项企业，是依靠人民公社的优越性建立起来的。这个公社由十九个高级农业社组成，所属地区包括山区、丘陵和平原三种地区。山区的特点是耕地多、山林多、人少和交通运输困难，公社化前，十个山区农业社光经营粮食生产已很吃力，很难抽出手来开发和利用山区资源；另方面，地处丘陵和平原地区的九个农业社，劳力虽多，但又缺少自然资源可供开发。因此各个农业社多种经营收入都不多。为了解决这个问题，去年4月，十九个农业社共同组成了联社（公社的雏形），采取联合经营的办法，开始开发山区资源，大搞多种经营。樟市公社一成立，又立刻在山岭中开辟了七条共长八十华里的公路和建立起水力加工厂，解放出大量经年绕道羊肠山路挑运的劳力和人工磨谷的劳力，为更好开发山区多种经营铺平了道路。接着，公社在统一规划、统一利用资源、统一安排劳力的原则下，从各大队抽出适当劳力，组成一支一千二百多人的开发山区资源的大军（其中从大队抽来七百八十多人，仅占各大队原农业劳力的7％，其余是圩镇的铁、木、泥水匠等技术工人），建起了上述十二项企业。
    社有企业和各生产单位，由于经营管理得好，生产成就巨大。今年1月到9月，公社这些直属生产单位的多种经营总收入，比全社各生产大队1月到7月工农业生产总收入还多23％。公社直属单位的多种经营中，以生产木材、木材半制品、木炭、石灰石、石灰等为大宗，还能成批制造汽车的拖车和马车等，不断为国家为公社自己提供工农业建设所需的原料和产品。由于公社一级多种经营发达，社办经济力量越来越雄厚，公社今年已投资三十四万元购买了一批机械和动力设备，目前已拥有四部拖拉机、两部载重汽车、一艘汽船和十三部动力机和车床等，为全公社实现农业机械化和电气化初步创造了条件。
    樟市公社社办经济的迅速壮大，又反转过来有力地支援了全社各生产队的生产。各生产队的畜禽饲养场和社员，由于不断从公社的畜牧种苗场得到雏禽和仔猪的供应，畜禽饲养业有了显著发展。各大队今年9月底生猪存栏量比去年同期增长22％，鸡、鸭、鹅存栏量比去年同期增长70％。由于公社所有制的大型多种经营生产的发展，各大队、小队的副业门路空前广阔。目前公社装备起来的汽车、汽船运输网担负起各生产队的运输任务和载运原料给各队加工；公社的各项大型企业更需社员提供大量原料。因此，公社在“农闲大搞、农忙小搞”的原则下，随时能给各队安排各种副业生产任务。由于具备了这样的有利条件，各大队多种经营收入显著增加，仅仅今年1至7月，各大队的多种经营总收入就达三十七万六千多元，比公社化前1957年全年各高级社的多种经营总收入还多4万多元。
    各生产队的农业生产，由于有公社经济力量作后盾和多种经营的支持，也得到了跃进。今年公社一级生产单位，生产了二千多吨石灰、一百多万斤颗粒肥料，公社还购买了十多万斤化肥，支援了各个大队的农业生产；同时，公社还在等价交换的原则下组织各个生产大队大协作，因而今年各大队的夏季粮食生产获得了平衡增产，全公社夏季粮食总产量比去年同期增长15.7％。目前，各大队的三万七千八百多亩晚稻（比去年同期扩大七百亩）开始灌浆垂头，禾苗生长普遍比去年好，丰收在望。
    由于公社社办经济的有力支援，樟市公社原来六个经济落后的生产大队也改变了面貌，逐渐赶上了富队。如光明大队过去因受旱严重，粮食产量低，副业门路少，成立公社前欠下国家贷款四万元。公社化后，公社党委组织了两千多人协助这个队修好水利，解除了旱患，因而今年早稻获得了丰收，总产量从去年的五十五万斤增至八十万斤。公社还帮助这个队建立了砖瓦厂、石灰厂、禽畜饲养场和经常交给木材运输任务，增加副业收入。从今年4月至8月，这个队的工业、副业纯收入已达一万五千元，除按月发工资外还存款六千五百元，全队每个劳力每月平均工资五元二角，赶上了全社的工资水平。
    随着公社社办多种经营的发展和促进各生产队的生产全面跃进，公社一级的公共积累，目前已达九十一万元，等于初级社和高级社过去三年中公共积累累计总和的六倍多。公社公共积累越来越雄厚的另一结果，是全社文教卫生等集体福利事业办得更多更好了。公社新办了一所初级中学、两所高级小学、二十八所幼儿园和一百零六所托儿所，全社学龄儿童已全部进了学校。文化生活方面，增设了一所广播站，增加了三百八十多个有线广播喇叭，电影放映队和业余文工团也已建立起来。公社还新建了一所有六十张病床的公社中心医院、两所分院、五个医疗站和十七所妇产院，实行了公社全体社员的公费医疗。
