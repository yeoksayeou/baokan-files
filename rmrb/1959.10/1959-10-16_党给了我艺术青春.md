　　The Party Gave Me Artistic Youth
　　Chen Bohua
    In the past, we women often liked to hide our age. Even if we were clearly in our thirties, we would always say we were only in our twenties. I was like that. Especially for an actress, one is even more afraid of getting old, of people not coming to see your plays. Actors like Director Mei Lanfang who could maintain artistic youth at such an advanced age were extremely rare in the past. But now, I have complete confidence and courage to learn from the older generation. I am already forty-two years old, and I want to strive to continue acting for twenty, thirty, or even forty years, so that my artistic youth can continue to be maintained for decades.
    This confidence and courage were given to me by the Party. Without the Party, there would be no Chen Bohua on the stage today. The true beginning of my stage artistic life, my true understanding of what art is and who art should serve, came after liberation. Before liberation, although I acted in plays for a few years and was "popular" for a while, most of those who supported me were masters and mistresses, who merely treated me as a plaything. The cannibalistic old society forced a 16-year-old girl, an actress who was growing artistically but not yet mature, to leave the stage and live a life of dependency. For an actress, what could be more painful than this?
    After liberation, it was the Party that rescued me from the grave. The Party gave me fresh air and new vitality. From then on, I began to gradually establish deep feelings with the most respectable and lovable worker-peasant-soldier masses. In many practical struggles, the Party gave me a profound socialist and communist education; in the Korean front慰问, the Fujian front慰问, in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the anti-rightist struggle, in the flood control struggle, in short, in a series of political movements and daily work and life, I always deeply felt the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Party, felt the Party's infinite care for the art cause, and felt that the Party was cultivating and educating me. I always listened to the Party and followed the Party closely. I came from the old society, and I had many shortcomings and faults. The Party always pointed out my faults and shortcomings with great patience and love, and taught me how to overcome them. Today's me is completely different from the me of the past. It is the Party that taught me to become a useful person to the people.
    In the past, I only thought that my mother was the person who loved me most in the world. Now, I feel that the Party cares about me even more than my mother. It not only cares about my artistic life, but also cares about my political life. The day I joined the Chinese Communist Party was the happiest and most memorable day of my life.
    The great rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward have made me more deeply realize the brilliance and correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policies. The Party's policies of "literature and art serving politics, production, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new" have made the relationship between art workers and the worker-peasant-soldier masses closer, and have made art more prosperous. In the past, a play would have at most one or two thousand audience members. Last year, when we went to perform in the countryside of the Xiaogan Special District, a play often had twenty or thirty thousand audience members. The laboring masses' enthusiastic welcome to us is indescribable. When we perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or live with them as ordinary laborers, my heart is always very excited. I have never felt so warm and happy as an actor as I do today. I have never felt so young as I do today. Our Han Opera, this ancient opera genre, and many of my colleagues, are also like this, and they all seem extraordinarily young. A large number of young actors are growing vigorously. I can say with certainty that they will greatly surpass our generation. The older generation, like the famous Han Opera young male lead Li Sili, often slept in the toilet before liberation. In winter, without a quilt, he would cover himself with a tattered "padded jacket" (worn inside the costume during performances), and he looked no different from a ghost. Today, he is radiant and has added several children. When he plays roles, he is almost like a young person, truly full of life.
    At the moment of celebrating the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, I feel extremely happy to be able to come to Beijing again, and I also feel ashamed. I have nothing better to offer as a gift to the Party. I am not very satisfied with the program I brought this time. But the Party gave me artistic youth, and I want to dedicate it to the Party forever. I will work hard to perform better plays for the twentieth and thirtieth anniversaries of the founding of the nation as a gift to the Party.

### 党给了我艺术青春

　　党给了我艺术青春
　　陈伯华
    从前，我们妇女常常喜欢隐瞒自己的年龄，明明是三十几岁，总要说只二十几岁，我就是这样的。尤其是一个演员，更是害怕年纪大了，别人不来看你的戏。像梅兰芳院长那样高龄而能保持艺术青春的演员，在从前是极少有的。但是现在，我完全有信心、有勇气向老前辈学习，我已经四十二岁了，我要争取继续演二十年、三十年甚至四十年的戏，让我的艺术青春继续保持几十年。
    这种信心和勇气是党给我的。没有党，就没有现在舞台上的陈伯华。我的舞台艺术生活的真正开始，我真正懂得什么是艺术、艺术要为谁服务，是解放以后的事。解放前，我虽然演了几年戏，也“红”过一阵，但当时捧我的大都是老爷、太太们，他们不过把我当作玩物而已。吃人的旧社会，让一个16岁的少女、在艺术上正在成长、尚未成熟的演员不得不脱离舞台，去过着寄居的生活。对于一个演员，有什么比这更痛苦？
    解放后，是党把我从坟墓里拯救出来，党给了我新鲜的空气，给了我新的生命力。从此，我才开始逐步和最可敬、最可爱的工农兵群众建立了深厚的感情。在很多实际斗争中，党让我受到了深刻的社会主义、共产主义教育；在朝鲜前线慰问、福建前线慰问，在肃反、反右斗争中，在防汛斗争中，总之，在一系列的政治运动和日常工作、生活中，我总是深切地感到党的光荣、伟大和正确，感到党对艺术事业的无限关怀，感到党在培养、教育着我，我也总是听党的话，紧紧地跟着党走。我从旧社会来，身上是有很多毛病和缺点的，党总是十分耐心、十分爱护地指出我的毛病和缺点，并教导我如何克服它。今天的我与从前的我，判若两人。是党，教导我成为一个对人民有用的人。
    从前，我只认为母亲是世界上最爱护我的人，现在，我感到党比母亲更要关怀我，她不仅关心我的艺术生活，更关心我的政治生活。加入中国共产党的那一天，是我一生中最幸福、最值得纪念的日子。
    伟大的整风运动和大跃进，使我更加深刻地认识到党的文艺方针的英明和正确。党提出的“文艺为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务”和“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，使艺术工作者与工农兵群众的关系更加密切起来了，使艺术更加繁荣起来了。从前，演一场戏，最多一千、两千观众，去年我们到孝感专区乡下演出，一场戏观众常常达到两万、三万。劳动群众对我们的热情欢迎是无法形容的。当我们为工人、农民和士兵们演出或作为一个普通劳动者与他们生活在一起时，我的心情总是十分激动的，我从来没有感到作一个演员有今天这样温暖、这样愉快，我从来没有感到自己有今天这样年轻。我们汉剧这个古老剧种、我的许多同行，也是这样，都显得异常年轻。大批的青年演员蓬勃地成长起来了，肯定讲，他们将要大大超过我们这一辈。老一辈，像汉剧名小生李四立，解放前常常在厕所里睡觉，冬天没有棉被，就盖着破烂的“胖袄”（演戏时衬在戏衣里面的），那样子真和鬼相差不远。今天，他却容光焕发，而且添了几个孩子，扮起戏来和年轻人差不多，真是生龙活虎一般。
    在庆祝伟大的建国十周年的时刻，能再一次来北京，我感到无比的幸福，也感到惭愧，我没有更好的东西向党献礼，这次带来的节目自己也不十分满意。但党给了我艺术青春，我要把它永远献给党，我将努力在建国二十、三十周年演出更好的戏向党献礼。
