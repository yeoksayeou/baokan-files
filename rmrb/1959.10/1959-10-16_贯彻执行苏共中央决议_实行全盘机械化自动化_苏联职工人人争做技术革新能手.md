Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 15th: Soviet workers are launching a massive technical innovation movement to implement the resolutions of the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee. The central content of this movement is to modernize existing industrial enterprises according to modern standards, replace old machines, and implement overall mechanization and automation of production. Currently, no industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union is not participating in the technical innovation movement. Almost all workers, engineering technicians, and entire production units are involved in the movement. Communist Youth League members, young workers, and Communist Party members stand at the forefront of the movement.

Technical Innovation Movement is Unprecedentedly Extensive and Deep

This movement was launched after the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee. Unlike in the past, the movement received strong leadership from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the Communist Youth League and trade unions from the very beginning, and thus developed very rapidly. The depth and breadth of the movement have reached an unprecedented scale.

The workers of industrial enterprises in the Perm region were the first to propose the resounding slogan "Every worker should become a technical innovator" to the entire country, and put forward the conditions for the challenge. This initiative immediately received enthusiastic support from workers everywhere.

The workers of Leningrad immediately responded to this battle call, guaranteeing that every workshop and section would have a unified technical innovation plan. All employees unanimously decided to complete the task of increasing labor productivity stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan within five years on the basis of technical innovation. Now, more than 25,000 young workers there have drawn up specific plans to complete this task.

The workers of Moscow are also not lagging behind, especially the young people who are full of vigor. The city's workers decided to start renovating 27 enterprises. After the launch of the movement, the workers of the "Red Proletarian" tractor factory immediately began to study the modification of new-style lathes. As a result, they completed the "One-Two-Eighty-Three" type high-efficiency new-style automatic lathe ahead of schedule, which will soon be put into mass production.

Localities Establish General Headquarters to Unify Combat Deployment

In order to strengthen the leadership of the technical innovation movement and further promote the movement, various localities have established technical innovation "General Headquarters," "Committees for Promoting Technological Progress," "Invention and Creation Groups," and inspection organizations for new products, and held observation and competition meetings for excellent proposals for mechanization and automation of production.

The technical innovation "General Headquarters" established in Moscow is led by the director of the Technical Bureau of the Moscow and Economic Committee and the secretaries of the Party and Youth League committees of each district. Each factory has also established a technical innovation "headquarters" to comprehensively formulate technical innovation plans. The Communist Youth League technical innovation "headquarters" of the First Ball Bearing Factory has absorbed more than 50 experienced young workers to participate and divided them into nine groups. There are more than 500 invention and creation groups established in various factories in Moscow.

Recently, good news has been reported from various places about the smooth progress of the movement. Through the observation and competition of excellent proposals for mechanization and automation, the employees of the enterprises in the Moscow region put forward more than 16,000 proposals, of which 13,000 have been adopted. Through one competition, the enterprises in the Ivanovo region modernized more than 20,000 outdated equipment.

Thousands of Employees Launch a Wave of Learning New Technologies

In order to provide a reliable foundation for technological progress, a mass movement to learn new technologies has been launched nationwide. The slogan put forward by the employees is: "To better carry out technical innovation, we must first improve our technical culture."

In the "Kirov" factory in Leningrad, the Second Clock Factory in Moscow, and many other factories, one in two people is learning new technologies. The "Kalinin" factory in Moscow, the "Three Mountains" textile factory, and the National First Ball Bearing Factory have all established cultural universities and technical night schools to enable every worker to have the cultural level of a secondary school within three to five years. The Zaporozhye Steel Plant will enable all employees to receive multi-professional production technology education within three years. Currently, there are 2.5 million workers across the Soviet Union learning new professions, more than 5 million workers systematically improving their proficiency, and 3.6 million people studying part-time in various night schools, correspondence schools, technical schools, and universities.

### 贯彻执行苏共中央决议　实行全盘机械化自动化  苏联职工人人争做技术革新能手

　　贯彻执行苏共中央决议　实行全盘机械化自动化
    苏联职工人人争做技术革新能手
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联广大职工正在展开一个声势浩大的生产技术革新运动，以贯彻执行苏共中央六月全会的决议。这个运动的中心内容是按现代化水平改建现有工业企业，更换旧机器，实行生产的全盘机械化和自动化。现在，苏联没有一个工业企业不参加生产技术革新运动。几乎所有的工人、工程技术人员和整个生产单位都卷入运动之中。共青团员、青年工人和共产党员一道，站在运动的最前列。
    技术革新运动空前广泛深入
    这个运动是在苏共中央六月全会以后展开的。和以往不同的是，运动一开始就得到了苏联共产党以及共青团和工会的坚强领导，因而开展得十分迅速，运动的深度和广度都达到了空前的规模。
    白尔姆州的工业企业的职工们最先向全国提出了“要使每个工人都成为技术革新者”的响亮口号，并且提出了挑战的条件。这个创议立即得到了各地职工的热烈支持。
    列宁格勒工人们马上响应了这个战斗的号召，他们保证：要使每个车间、工段都有统一的技术革新计划。全体职工一致决定，要在革新技术的基础上，在五年内完成七年计划规定的提高劳动生产率的任务。现在，那里已有二万五千多名青年工人订出了完成这一任务的具体计划。
    莫斯科的工人们也不落后，青年们尤其是气势磅礴。全市职工决定着手改建二十七项企业。“红色无产者”拖拉机工厂的工人们在运动开展后，立刻动手研究改制新式车床，结果提前制成了“一二——八三”型高效能的新式自动车床，不久即将成批投入生产。各地成立总司令部统一战斗部署
    为加强技术革新运动的领导和把运动更向前推进，各地纷纷成立了技术革新“总司令部”、“技术进步促进委员会”、“发明创造小组”，以及新产品的监督检查组织，并举行生产机械化和自动化优秀建议观摩比赛会等。
    莫斯科市成立的技术革新“总司令部”由莫斯科和经济委员会技术局局长和各区的党、团委员会书记亲自参加领导。各工厂也成立了技术革新“司令部”，全面制定技术革新计划。第一滚珠轴承厂的共青团技术革新“司令部”吸收了五十多名有经验的青年工人参加，分成九个小组。莫斯科各工厂成立的发明创造小组已有五百多个。
    最近以来，各地纷纷传来运动顺利进展的喜讯。莫斯科州的企业的职工们通过机械化和自动化优秀建议观摩比赛，提出了一万六千多条建议，其中一万三千条已被采用。伊凡诺佛州的企业通过一次比赛，使两万多种过时了的设备现代化了。
    千万职工掀起学习新技术热潮
    为了使技术进步有可靠的基础，在全国范围内掀起了一个群众性的学习新技术的热潮。职工们为自己提出的口号是：“要更好地进行技术革新，必须先提高自己的技术文化。”
    在列宁格勒“基洛夫”工厂、莫斯科第二钟表工厂和其他许多工厂中，每两人就有一人在学习新技术。莫斯科“加里宁”工厂、“三山”纺织厂、国家第一滚珠轴承厂都专门开设了文化大学和技术夜校等，要在三、五年之内使每个工人都具有中等学校的文化水平。萨坡罗什炼钢厂要在三年内使全体职工都受到多种专业生产技术教育。现在，全苏联共有二百五十万工人在学习新的专业，五百多万工人在有计划地提高自己的熟练程度，在各种夜校，函授学校、工艺学校和高等学校中不脱产学习的有三百六十万人。
