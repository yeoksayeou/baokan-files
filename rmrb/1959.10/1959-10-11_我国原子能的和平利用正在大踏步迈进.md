　　China's Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy is Advancing by Leaps and Bounds
　　Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    While celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, it is extremely exciting to look back at the development of China's peaceful use of atomic energy.
    Over the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new force of atomic energy science and technology, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party and with the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet Union, has grown vigorously. The peaceful use of atomic energy is gradually penetrating into various aspects of industry, agriculture, medicine and health, and scientific research. Teaching, research, application, and popularization of atomic energy are being carried out vigorously throughout the country. This vigorous situation only emerged after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The formation of this situation is a victory for Comrade Mao Zedong's great thought, a victory for the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and a victory for the Party's policy of adhering to putting politics in command and following the mass line on the science and technology front.
    Before the liberation of the whole country, research on atomic nucleus science had already begun in China. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, science was only used as an ornament and could not be developed at all. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the large-scale civil war waged by the Kuomintang reactionaries with the support of American imperialism, China's originally weak scientific strength was devastated. By the eve of the liberation of the whole country, there were only about ten atomic nucleus science researchers scattered throughout the country, and there was not even a small accelerator in terms of equipment. The legacy left by old China in the atomic energy science and technology sector was very pitiful.
    After the liberation of the whole country, the Party Central Committee attached great importance to the scientific research and application of atomic energy and vigorously led it. It provided continuous support in all aspects, from equipping leading cadres and training young scientific and technical personnel to providing financial and material resources, so that this science and technology grew rapidly from scratch and became stronger. Imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain once arrogantly thought that as long as they united to implement an economic blockade against China, they could hinder the development of China's economic construction and cultural and scientific construction, but their despicable dreams completely failed. As early as before 1955, through our own efforts, we had mastered technology, established equipment, and carried out research work in several fields of atomic nucleus science. In 1955, the Soviet government assisted China in building reactors and accelerators, laying an important material foundation for the development of China's atomic energy industry. In 1956, the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries jointly established the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, uniting our scientists to conduct research on elementary particles. During the same period, Chinese scientific and technical workers and Soviet scientists in China also gave a series of lectures popularizing atomic energy science and technology, and exhibited the Soviet Union's major achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy in Beijing, and later in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. All of this vigorously promoted China's peaceful use of atomic energy. As a result, the research and education teams of atomic nucleus science grew rapidly in several central cities, and radioactive isotopes began to be applied in industry, medicine, and other fields. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, atomic nucleus science was not only no longer a blank sector in China, but had also become an important scientific and technological sector, achieving certain results.
    In 1958, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao brilliantly put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." We also resolutely implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of combining the central and local authorities and combining large, medium, and small-sized enterprises in the atomic energy industry. Because of putting politics in command, following the mass line, liberating thought, breaking superstitions, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, as well as the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, China's atomic energy science and technology ushered in a situation of Great Leap Forward and great development. From then on, it broke the bleak situation of being run by a few people and leaped into a vigorous mass movement stage of "everyone doing it." Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively established atomic energy-related research institutions; more scientific research units have planned to participate in the large-scale collaboration of atomic energy science and technology research; various industrial departments have actively supported the needs of this science and technology; many universities and colleges have set up departments or majors specializing in training atomic energy science and technology cadres; many atomic energy science and technology departments that had not been opened up in the past have now begun to be established; and the use of radioactive isotopes in geological, mechanical, metallurgical, chemical, biological, medical, agricultural and other departments has been vigorously carried out. In this way, since the Great Leap Forward, from basic disciplines such as theoretical and experimental atomic nucleus physics, cosmic rays, high-energy particle physics, and radiochemistry, to disciplines such as geology, metallurgy, chemical industry, atomic nucleus dynamics, medicine, and agronomy, a broad front for utilizing atomic energy to advance towards nature has rapidly formed on our vast socialist land. Although this atomic energy science and technology team is still young, it is full of new vitality. The achievements made in the past year have exceeded the work done in the eight years after liberation in many aspects, and far exceeded the total work done in the twenty years before liberation. Under the wise leadership of the Party, China's peaceful use of atomic energy is advancing by leaps and bounds.
    Because this science and technology involves a very wide range, it is difficult to describe the work in all aspects in a short space. Therefore, below we will only introduce a part of the achievements obtained in the basic sciences of atomic energy science and technology in the past ten years.
    I. Experimental Nuclear Physics
    Accelerators and reactors are indispensable and important equipment for the development of atomic nucleus science and technology. After liberation, China made great efforts in establishing these equipment. In June 1958, with the help of the Soviet Union, the largest heavy water research reactor in Asia with a power of 7,000 to 10,000 kilowatts, and a cyclotron that can accelerate particles to 25 million electron volts were built. Their performance is very good. The neutron flux intensity of the reactor and the ion flux intensity of the cyclotron have reached the international advanced level. Our own designed and manufactured 2.5 million electron volt proton electrostatic accelerator, high-voltage multiplier, and the electron induction accelerator supplied by the Soviet Union are also in operation. In addition, other types of accelerators such as electron electrostatic accelerators and electron cyclotrons are also being designed and manufactured. Through the installation, manipulation, and design of these accelerators and reactors, a group of new cadres engaged in the research, design, and manufacturing of reactors and accelerators have grown up. High vacuum is an indispensable and important technology for accelerators and many other sciences and technologies. In this regard, we have been able to design and manufacture large-volume metal diffusion pumps that meet the requirements. Work in atomic nucleus physics, radiation chemistry, isotope preparation, and radiobiology is being carried out intensively on reactors and these accelerators. A large number of young scientists are growing up.
    Corresponding to the particle generators described above, we have manufactured heavy particle spectrometers and several β-spectrometers. Several neutron spectrometers and crystal spectrometers have been built next to the reactor and cyclotron. Research on the β and γ energy spectra of atomic nuclei, atomic nucleus reactions, neutron energy spectra, and fission physics is being carried out on these spectrometers. In addition, the masses of light atomic nuclei have been systematically sorted out and discussed.
    In the research of detection instruments, we have also achieved achievements. We have carried out systematic research on atomic nucleus emulsion and Geiger counters. We have understood the relationship between various factors in the emulsion preparation process, and thus have made emulsions that are sensitive to protons and electrons and have relatively high efficiency in detecting neutrons. The discharge mechanism of the counter tube has been studied, and thus neutron counters and various organic gas and halogen gas β and γ counters with good performance have been made. Both of these works won the Science Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1956.
    In addition, research, manufacturing, and improvement work has been carried out on cloud chambers, scintillation crystals, ionization chambers, magnetrons, and photomultiplier tubes and other special electron tubes.
    In the aspect of atomic nucleus electronics, multi-faceted work has been carried out. Now we can not only solve the general electronic circuit problems raised by radioactive measurement, isotope application, and atomic nucleus physics, but also have laid a good foundation in multi-channel pulse analyzers and nanosecond pulse technology recently needed for atomic nucleus physics and high-energy physics.
    II. Cosmic Rays and High Energy Physics
    We built a cosmic ray laboratory at an altitude of 3,185 meters in southern China. There is very little snow throughout the year, and working and living conditions are relatively convenient. Multi-plate cloud chambers and magnetic field cloud chambers are installed there. Using these devices, more than 100,000 pairs of stereo photos were taken, 700 cases of strange particle decay were measured, and the mass and lifetime of heavy mesons θ° and hyperons ∧°, the ratio of their production rates, and the angular distribution problems when they decay and are produced were studied. These results are very consistent with the results obtained by other countries using other methods. Several relatively rare cases were also found in these cases, and the researchers analyzed these cases and gave appropriate explanations. For example, an interesting case is: a high-energy nuclear interaction occurring in a lead plate in a multi-plate cloud chamber emits a heavy meson. After this heavy meson stops in the lead plate, it emits a ∧ hyperon and a high-speed charged particle. This heavy meson is interpreted as a Kˉ meson; while this Kˉ meson is produced, another unstable heavy particle is also produced, and this unstable heavy particle also decays in the cloud chamber.
    In addition, equipment for observing cosmic ray intensity has been established, including a cubic M meson telescope, a neutron recorder, and a large-volume ionization chamber. Among these devices, the large-volume ionization chamber was donated by the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee.
    Chinese scientists have also participated in the work of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research composed of twelve countries in Dubna, Soviet Union. Using the particles generated by the world's largest 10 billion electron volt synchrophasotron and the 680 million electron volt synchrocyclotron with good performance and efficiency, the nuclear reactions of high-energy mesons and high-energy protons were studied using bubble chambers, emulsions, and Cherenkov counters. In these works, Chinese scientists have good cooperation with scientists from socialist countries. Recently, at the Ninth High Energy Physics Conference held in Kiev, reports were made on the achievements of the above cooperation, including data on the cross-section ratio and angular distribution of the interaction between high-energy π mesons and protons producing ∧ hyperons and neutral K mesons, and new results on the elastic scattering between high-energy π mesons and protons. In addition, the discovery of traces that may be new unstable particles in Dubna was also announced. This particle is named the Д particle—Д refers to the first letter of the city of Dubna and is also the first letter of the Russian word "friendship." This is the crystallization of friendship. These achievements were obtained under the guidance and encouragement of Soviet scientists and through the joint efforts of scientists from socialist countries.
    III. Atomic Nucleus and Elementary Particle Theory
    In the theoretical aspect of atomic nucleus, using the shell model concept, the calculation method was improved, and a systematic calculation of the energy levels of atomic nuclei near the lead of the full shell layer was carried out. The calculated values of more than 60 energy levels are in good agreement with the experimental data, which indicates that the interaction strength between two nucleons in the atomic nucleus is roughly close to the nuclear force.
    In terms of nuclear force, systematic work has been done on the low-energy phenomenological theory. Recently, the trial wave function has been improved, pointing out that the two-body force mixed by the central force and the tensor force may explain the binding energy problem of light atomic nuclei.
    In addition, relatively systematic exploratory work has been carried out in the comprehensive model of nuclear structure and the shell model, laying a good start for further research.
    In the theory of elementary particles. First, research was launched on the decay and capture phenomena of elementary particles centered on the universal Fermi weak interaction theory proposed by Gell-Mann and Feynman: the results applied to the angular distribution analysis of ∧ hyperon decay indicate that ∧ hyperons may be particles with a spin of 1/2; the M meson capture phenomenon radiated by protons was explored. Secondly, in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, under the guidance of Soviet scientists, Chinese and Soviet scientists cooperated to conduct relatively systematic research on how to experimentally determine the spin and relative parity of strange particles. By trying to apply kinematic considerations and avoiding using dynamic hypotheses, the results of discussing spin and parity are relatively reliable.
    In addition, work on the mathematical form of quantum field theory has been carried out. Recently, due to the development of dispersion relation theory, the analytical properties of scattering functions have also attracted the attention of Chinese theoretical physicists.
    IV. Isotope Chemistry and Isotope Application
    Among radiochemical separation methods, the ion exchange method is more commonly used. For example: using a strong acid type exchange resin with hydrochloric acid as an eluent, microcurie amounts of radium or new thorium have been separated from constant amounts of barium. Using a hydroxyl-type strongly alkaline resin as a filter precipitant, new thorium II was quickly separated from new thorium I. A series of studies have also been carried out in extraction processes and isotope exchange.
    In the aspect of stable isotopes, systematic analysis of heavy water components in water from various places has been carried out, proving that some oil fields have high heavy water content. Research on the separation of boron, oxygen, and other isotopes has been carried out, and enriched boron needed for detection technology has been obtained.
    In the year since the heavy water reactor was put into operation, we have trial-produced more than 30 kinds of isotopes such as phosphorus-32. Several kinds of labeled compounds used in biological and medical research have also been trial-produced.
    The application of isotopes has universally attracted the attention of various aspects of industry, agriculture, medicine, and scientific and technological research. This new technology is rapidly permeating into various departments of the national economy and various aspects of science and technology, and has achieved beneficial results.
    First of all, in the industrial aspect, radioactive logging methods have been applied to geological surveys of petroleum, coal, etc. These logging methods are of great help in determining the oil storage structure of oil areas and determining coal seams. The application of mechanical flaw detection methods is more common. Tens of thousands of inspections have proved that the new equipment that has passed the inspection has not experienced quality accidents. It has become an indispensable inspection procedure for the production and installation projects of several departments. The method of using radioactivity to measure and check the damage of blast furnace linings has also begun to be applied. In the chemical industry, the research work that has achieved results includes: using γ-ray irradiation to increase the effective insecticidal component of pesticide 666 (γ-isomer of hexachlorobenzene) from 14%-16% to 22% using conventional methods; using a reactor as a radiation source, it has been proved that the polymerization of styrene is relatively easy. In addition, isotopes have also begun to be applied in the cement industry and other fields.
    In the agricultural aspect, systematic research on the use of radiation for crop storage has been carried out; work on the use of radiation to irradiate various plant seeds to study the impact on plant growth and development has also achieved certain results. In addition, applications in soil moisture determination have also been carried out.
    Medical departments attach great importance to the application of isotopes, whether in diagnosis, treatment, or medical research. The works that have achieved results include: using iodine and phosphorus for clinical diagnosis, and using cobalt and phosphorus for cancer treatment. Iodine is used to treat hyperthyroidism, and antimony is used to conduct pharmacological research on the antidote for antimony preparations for the treatment of schistosomiasis.
    In the past ten years, although we have made progress and achieved some achievements, it is still far from keeping up with the ever-increasing scientific and technological needs of China's socialist construction. The rapid development of socialist industry and agriculture has led to an increasing demand for power. The completion of the Soviet atomic energy power station and the continuous new progress in the research on controllable thermonuclear reactions have shown us the infinitely broad prospects for opening up new energy sources; the research on elementary particles is exploring ways for mankind to further understand the material world and utilize material resources; the expanding scope of isotope application shows the huge potential of this cutting-edge science and technology. These have all put forward glorious and arduous tasks for our atomic energy scientists and technicians.
    On the eve of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the Soviet cosmic rocket accurately reached the moon, and the atomic icebreaker officially sailed. These world-shaking news have given us great encouragement. We must continue to forge ahead under the illumination of the Party'

　　我国原子能的和平利用正在大踏步迈进
　　中国科学院原子能研究所所长　钱三强
    在庆祝我们伟大的祖国建国十周年的时候，回顾一下我国原子能和平利用事业的发展过程，令人感到万分兴奋。
    建国十年来，一支新生的原子能科学技术队伍，在党的领导和培育下，在苏联的热忱援助下，已经茁壮地生长起来。原子能的和平利用正在逐渐地渗透到工业、农业、医药卫生和科学研究的各个方面；全国各地区都蓬蓬勃勃地进行着原子能的教学、研究、应用和普及的工作，这样轰轰烈烈的局面，是在1958年大跃进以后才出现的，这种局面的形成，是毛泽东同志的伟大思想的胜利，是党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的胜利，是党在科学技术战线上坚持政治挂帅和群众路线的方针政策的胜利。
    在全国解放前，我国原子核科学的研究工作就已开始。但是在国民党反动政府的统治下，科学只是作为装饰品，根本得不到发展。在抗日战争时期和国民党反动派在美帝国主义支持下进行大规模的内战时期，我国本来基础薄弱的科学力量又遭受到摧残。到了全国解放前夕，散在国内各地的原子核科学研究人员只有十人左右，设备方面连一台小型加速器都没有。旧中国在原子能科学技术部门留下来的遗产是非常可怜的。
    在全国解放以后，党中央非常重视原子能的科学研究和应用，并且大力加以领导，从配备领导干部、培养青年科学技术人员到提供财力、物力等各个方面都给予了不断的支持，使这门科学技术从无到有地迅速地生长和壮大起来。美英等帝国主义国家曾经狂妄地以为只要他们联合起来对我国实行经济封锁，就可以阻碍我国的经济建设和文化科学建设的发展，但是他们的卑鄙的梦想完全落空了。早在1955年以前，经过自己的努力，我们已经在原子核科学的若干领域内掌握了技术，建立了设备，开展了研究工作。1955年苏联政府援助我国建立反应堆和加速器，为我国发展原子能事业奠定了重要的物质基础。1956年苏联和社会主义阵营各个国家又共同建立联合原子核研究所，使我们各国科学工作者团结在一起进行有关基本粒子的研究。在同一时期，我国的科学技术工作者和苏联来中国的科学家们又进行了一系列的普及原子能科学技术的讲演，并且在北京，以后又在上海、广州、成都各地展出了苏联在和平利用原子能方面的重大成就。所有这一切都有力地推动了我国和平利用原子能的事业。结果在几个中心城市里原子核科学的研究和教育队伍迅速地生长起来了，放射性同位素开始在工业、医学等方面得到应用。在第一个五年计划完了时，原子核科学在我国不仅不再是空白部门，而且已经成为一个重要的科学技术部门，获得了一定的成绩。
    1958年，党中央和毛主席英明地提出了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，我们在原子能事业中也坚决地贯彻了中央和地方并举、大中小并举的“两条腿走路”的方针。由于政治挂帅，走了群众路线，解放了思想，破除了迷信，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格和共产主义大协作的精神，我国的原子能科学技术就出现了大跃进、大发展的形势，从此打破了少数人办的冷冷清清的局面，一跃而进入到轰轰烈烈的“大家办”的群众运动阶段。许多省、市、自治区纷纷地建立起了有关原子能的研究机构；更多的科学研究单位有计划地参加了原子能科学技术研究工作的大协作；各个工业部门积极地支持了这门科学技术的需要；许多大学和学院设置了专门培养原子能科学技术干部的科系或专业；不少过去没有开辟的原子能科学技术的部门现在开始建立了；在地质、机械、冶金、化学、生物、医学、农业等部门利用放射性同位素的工作更是蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。这样，自大跃进以来从理论和实验原子核物理、宇宙线、高能粒子物理、放射化学等基本学科，一直到地质、冶金、化工、原子核动力学、医学、农学等学科，一个从事利用原子能向大自然进军的广阔的战线已经在我们辽阔的社会主义国土上迅速地形成。这一支原子能科学技术队伍虽然还年轻，但是充满着新生的活力。一年来作出的成绩在很多方面超过了解放后八年多的工作，更远远地超过解放前二十年工作的总和。在党的英明领导下，我国原子能的和平利用正在大踏步地迈进中。
    由于这门科学技术涉及的范围非常广泛，很难在短短的篇幅里将各方面的工作都加以叙述，因此下面我们只介绍在原子能科学技术基本科学中十年来获得的成就的一部分。
    一、实验原子核物理
    加速器和反应堆是发展原子核科学技术不可缺少的重要设备，解放后我国在建立这些设备方面作了很大努力。1958年6月在苏联帮助下，建成了现在亚洲最大的、功率为七千至一万瓩的重水型研究性反应堆，能加速?粒子到二千五百万电子伏特的回旋加速器。它们的性能非常良好。反应堆的中子流的强度和回旋加速器的离子流强度达到了国际上先进水平。我们自己设计和制成的二百五十万电子伏特的质子静电加速器、高压倍加器和苏联供应的电子感应加速器也正在运转着。此外，电子静电加速器、电子回旋加速器等其它类型的加速器也正在设计和制造中。通过这些加速器和反应堆的安装、操纵和设计，一批新生的从事反应堆和加速器的研究、设计和制造的干部生长起来了。高度真空是加速器和其它许多科学技术不可缺少的重要技术，在这方面我们已经能设计和制造合乎要求的大体积的金属扩散泵。在反应堆和这些加速器上正在紧张地进行着原子核物理、辐射化学、同位素制备、放射生物等方面的工作。大量的青年科学工作者正在成长中。
    与上面叙述的粒子发生器相适应，我们制成了重粒子谱仪和几种β一谱仪。在反应堆和回旋加速器旁建成了几种中子谱仪和晶体谱仪。在这些谱仪上正在进行着原子核的β和γ能谱、原子核反应、中子能谱和裂变物理等方面的研究工作。此外还对轻原子核的质量作了系统的整理与探讨。
    在探测仪器的研究方面，我们也获得了成就，在原子核乳胶和盖革计数管方面进行了系统的研究。了解了乳胶制备过程中各种因素之间的关系，从而制成了对质子、电子灵敏的以及对探测中子效率比较高的乳胶。研究了计数管的放电机构，从而制成了性能良好的中子计数管和各种有机气体的和卤素气体的β、γ计数管。这两方面工作都获得了中国科学院1956年的科学奖金。
    此外还进行了云雾室，闪烁晶体，游离室，磁旋管和光电倍加管等特种电子管的研究、制造和改进工作。
    在原子核电子学方面，进行了多方面的工作。现在已经不但能解决放射性测量、同位素应用、原子核物理等方面所提出的一般的电子线路问题，并且在原子核物理和高能物理最近所需要的多道脉冲分析器和毫微秒脉冲技术等方面也打下了良好的基础。
    二、宇宙线和高能物理
    在中国南部海拔三千一百八十五米高处，我们建造了一个宇宙线实验室。终年很少有雪，工作和生活条件比较方便，在那里装置了多板云雾室和有磁场的云雾室。利用这些设备，共拍摄了十万多对立体照片，测察到奇异粒子衰变的七百个事例，研究了重介子θ°和超子∧°的质量和寿命，它们产生率的比值和它们衰变与产生时的角分布问题。这些结果同别国用其它方法得到的结果很吻合。在这些事例中还找到了几个比较稀少的事例，研究工作者们对这些事例作了分析并且给了适当的解释。比如其中的一个有兴趣的事例是：一个多板云雾室内铅板中发生的高能核作用里发射出一个重介子。这个重介子停止在铅板中后又发射出一个∧超子和一个高速带电粒子，这个重介子被解释为Kˉ介子；在产生这Kˉ介子的同时，还产生了另一个不稳定重粒子，并且这个不稳定重粒子也在云雾室内衰变。
    另外还建立了观测宇宙线强度的设备，其中有立方形M介子望远镜，中子记录器和大体积的电离室，在这些设备中，大体积电离室是苏联国际地球物理年委员会赠送的。
    我国的科学工作者还参加了在苏联杜布纳城的十二个国家组成的联合原子核研究所的工作。利用了世界上最大的一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器和性能、效率都很好的六点八亿电子伏特的同步回旋加速器产生的粒子，用气泡室、乳胶和契伦科夫计数器等进行高能介子和高能质子的核反应等的研究。在这些工作中，我国的科学工作者和社会主义各国科学工作者有很好的合作。最近在基辅召开的第九届高能物理会议上，曾就以上合作的成果作了报告，其中有高能π介子与质子发生作用后产生∧超子和中性K介子的作用截面比例和角分布等的数据，有关于高能π介子与质子间的弹性散射的新结果，除此以外还宣布了在杜布纳找到有可能是新的不稳定粒子的迹象。这个粒子被命名为Д粒子——Д指杜布纳城的第一个字母，又是俄文“友谊”的第一个字母，这是友谊的结晶。这些成就是在苏联科学家的指导与鼓励下、社会主义各国科学家们共同努力下获得的。
    三、原子核和基本粒子理论
    在原子核的理论方面，利用了壳模型观念，改进了计算方法，对满壳层的原子核铅附近的原子核的能级进行了系统的计算。已计算的六十多个能级的数值与实验的数据符合得很好，这表明在原子核内两个核子之间的相互作用强度大致上与核力相接近。
    在核力方面，曾对低能唯象理论方面进行过系统的工作。最近改进了试算波函数，指出由有心力与张量力混合的两体力有可能解释轻原子核结合能问题。
    此外在核结构的综合模型方面，壳模型方面，也曾进行了比较系统的探索性工作，为进一步研究打下良好的开端。
    在基本粒子理论方面。首先是围绕盖尔曼和范曼所提出的普遍费米弱相互作用理论展开了关于基本粒子衰变和俘获现象的研究：应用于∧超子衰变产物角分布分析的结果，指出∧超子可能是自旋为1／2的粒子；探讨了M介子为质子所辐射俘获现象。其次是在联合原子核研究所中，在苏联科学家指导下，中国和苏联的科学工作者合作进行了比较系统的关于如何在实验上测定奇异粒子的自旋和相对宇称的研究。由于尽量应用运动学的考虑，避免用动力学的假说，因而讨论自旋和宇称的结果是比较可靠的。
    另外还进行了量子场论的数学形式的工作，最近由于色散关系理论的发展，散射函数的解析性质也引起了中国理论物理工作者的注意。
    四、同位素化学和同位素应用
    在放射化学分离方法中离子交换法用的比较普遍。例如：用强酸型交换树脂以盐酸为流洗剂，曾从常量的钡中分离出微居里量的镭或新钍。用羟基型强碱性树脂作过滤沉淀剂，很快地从新钍Ⅰ中分离出新钍Ⅱ。在萃取过程和同位素交换等方面也作了一系列的研究。
    在稳定同位素方面，系统地进行了各地水中重水成份的分析，证明有些油田中重水含量较高。进行了硼、氧等同位素分离的研究，得到了探测技术所需要的浓缩硼。
    重水反应堆开动一年来，我们已经试制出了磷32等同位素三十多种。并且试制了若干种在生物和医学研究工作上应用的标记化合物。
    同位素的应用普遍地引起工业、农业、医学、科学技术研究各方面的注意，这门新技术正在迅速地渗透到国民经济各个部门，科学技术的各个方面，并且已经取得了有益的效果。
    首先是在工业方面，放射性测井的方法已经应用于石油、煤炭等地质勘测工作。这些测井方法对于确定油区的储油构造和确定煤层帮助很大。机械探伤方法的应用比较普遍。上万次的检验证明，经过检验合格的新设备没有发生过质量的事故，它已经成为若干部门生产和安装工程所不可缺少的检验工序。利用放射性测定和检查高炉炉衬的损坏的方法也已经开始应用。在化学工业方面，研究工作已经取得成果的有：用γ射线的照射，使农药666的有效杀虫成份（六氯化苯的γ体）从用通常方法的14％—16％提高到22％；用反应堆作辐射源，证明苯乙烯的聚合是比较容易的。此外，在水泥工业等方面也都开始应用同位素。
    在农业方面，开展了利用射线进行农作物贮藏的系统研究；利用射线照射各种植物的种子以研究对于植物生长发育的影响工作，也已取得了一定的效果。此外还进行了土壤水分的测定等方面的应用。
    医学部门对于同位素应用，不管在诊断、治疗或者医学研究方面都非常重视。得到成果的工作有：用碘和磷临床诊断，用钴和磷治疗癌症。用碘治疗甲状腺机能患进亢者，用锑进行了治疗血吸虫病锑剂的解毒剂的药理研究。
    这十年来，我们虽然有了进步和获得了一些成就，但是还远远赶不上我国社会主义建设中日益增长的科学技术的需要。社会主义工农业的高速发展，对动力的需求日益增加，苏联原子能电站的建成和在研究可控制热核反应方面不断取得新的进展，都为我们展示了开辟新能源的无限广阔的前景；基本粒子的研究为人类进一步认识物质世界和利用物质资源探索着途径；同位素应用范围的日益扩展，显示了这门尖端科学技术巨大的潜力。这些都给我们原子能科学技术人员提出了光荣而艰巨的任务。
    在庆祝我们伟大的祖国建国十周年的前夕，苏联的宇宙火箭准确地到达月球，原子能破冰船正式航行。这些震动全世界的消息更加给了我们莫大的鼓舞。我们一定在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线照耀下继续奋勇前进，学习苏联的先进经验，作出更多更大的贡献。
