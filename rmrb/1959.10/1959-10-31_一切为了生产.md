Everything for Production
By a Commentator of this newspaper

Setting up comprehensive stores in industrial and mining areas, implementing diversified operations, and comprehensively undertaking the task of organizing the economic life of the people in industrial and mining areas, and doing a good job in commodity supply and life services, has a great promoting effect on the development of production. The Tongjialiang Store in Shanxi has set a good example for commercial work in industrial and mining areas.

Our country's original industrial foundation was very weak, and most of the industrial and mining areas have only been developed in recent years. Compared with general cities and rural areas, they have their own characteristics. That is, they were originally sparsely populated, or even uninhabited, with few or no stores. Once production and construction start, the population increases rapidly, and everything is needed, including food, drink, clothing, use, bathing, hairdressing, repairs, etc. Some things may seem small, but if no one does them, it will cause great inconvenience to the vast number of workers in their lives, thereby affecting production. Therefore, commercial comrades in industrial and mining areas, with a concrete and profound understanding of the importance of their work in socialist construction, should do everything possible to do a good job in commodity supply and life services in industrial and mining areas in their actual work, and try every means to promote the great development of steel, coal, petroleum, timber and other production. This is an important issue related to the high-speed development of the national economy. The entire staff of the Tongjialiang Coal Mine Area Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, first found the direction and method for commercial work in industrial and mining areas across the country on this issue. Everyone takes politics as the commander, and everyone is full of energy, establishing a clear, concrete, and firm production viewpoint, serving everything for ten thousand-ton mines, and doing everything for producing more coal. This idea is not only implemented into the thinking of every commercial worker and various specific business activities, but also deeply implemented into the thinking of every family member. Therefore, they ensure that supplies reach wherever production goes, and supply whatever production and workers need, when it is needed. They leave the difficulties to themselves and provide convenience to the miners, trying everything possible to ensure that the miners eat well, dress well, use well, and rest well, so that they can be energetic and motivated to carry out the coal-winning battle.

In the production and construction of industrial and mining areas, experience has proved that the great leap forward in production has driven the great leap forward in commercial work, and the great leap forward in commercial work has promoted the great leap forward in production. From March to September this year, the Tongjialiang Coal Mine reached the level of "ten thousand-ton mine" for seven consecutive months, and the Tongjialiang Store also overfulfilled the purchase and sales tasks from January to September, reduced expenses, and increased accumulation. This is not an accidental achievement. Firmly establishing the concept of serving production, and being as close as a family between industry and commerce, is an important experience for the Tongjialiang Store to do a good job in mine area supply and service work.

If the staff of the commercial department have a firm view of serving production, and combine it with the thinking of the competent departments of industrial and mining enterprises who care about production and life, the direct role in production will be very great. From the perspective of production enterprises, to do a good job in production, we must do a good job in the lives of employees. To do a good job in the lives of employees, we must help stores do a good job in supply and service. The Tongjialiang Mine Party Committee regards the store as a component of the coal mine. When holding meetings to study work, they always absorb the store's leaders to participate, exchange information, and study together; when the store has difficulties, they try their best to provide various support. When the coal mine organizes high-yield campaigns, the store organizes propaganda and condolences; when the coal mine overfulfills its production tasks and reports good news, it also reports good news to the store. Industry and commerce encourage and promote each other. Here, it fully illustrates that adhering to political command is the prerequisite for doing a good job in production and life, and political work is the lifeline of all economic work. It is unimaginable to develop production at high speed by deviating from the party's political and ideological work.

Currently, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of workers on the industrial front are exerting soaring revolutionary vigor and are preparing to over fulfill their production tasks ahead of schedule this year and continue to leap forward next year. Under this circumstance, commercial workers in industrial and mining areas must, in accordance with the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly oppose rightism, exert full energy, and immediately launch a widespread and in-depth mass movement to learn from Tongjialiang, catch up with Tongjialiang, and surpass Tongjialiang, and strive to greatly improve the level of commercial work in industrial, mining and forest areas in a short period of time.

    一切为了生产
    本报评论员
    在工矿区设置综合性商店，实行多种经营，全面地担负起组织工矿区人民经济生活的任务，做好商品供应和生活服务工作，对发展生产有着极大的促进作用。山西同家梁商店为工矿区商业工作作出很好的榜样。
    我们国家原有的工业基础十分薄弱，工矿区大都是近几年新发展起来的，它同一般城市和农村比较起来自有其不同特点。这就是原来人烟稀少，甚至荒无人烟，没有或很少有商店，生产建设一搞起来，人口便迅速增加，吃的、喝的、穿的、用的、洗澡、理发、修修补补等等，样样都需要，缺一不可。有些看起来是小事情，但是如果没人去做，就会给广大职工在生活上造成很大的不便，从而影响生产。因此，在工矿区的商业工作同志，具体深刻地认识到自己的工作在社会主义建设中的重要性，在实际工作中，千方百计地做好工矿区商品供应和生活服务工作，想尽各种办法促进钢铁、煤炭、石油、木材等生产的大发展，是关系国民经济高速度发展的一个重要的问题。山西省大同市同家梁煤矿区商店全体职工首先是在这个问题上，为全国工矿区商业工作找到了方向和作法。他们人人政治挂帅，个个干劲冲天，树立了明确的、具体的、牢固的生产观点，一切为了万吨矿服务，一切为了多出煤炭。这一思想不仅贯彻到每个商业职工同志和各种具体业务活动中去，而且也深入地贯彻到每个家属的思想中去，因此，他们作到了生产到哪里，供应到哪里，生产和职工需要什么，就供应什么，什么时候需要，什么时候供应，困难留给自己，方便送给矿工，想尽一切办法让矿工吃饱、吃好、穿好、用好、休息好，从而使他们精力充沛、意志奋发地去进行夺煤大战。
    在工矿区的生产建设中，经验证明：生产的大跃进带动了商业工作的大跃进，商业工作的大跃进又促进了生产的大跃进。同家梁煤矿从今年3月到9月连续七个月达到了“万吨矿”的水平，同家梁商店也超额完成了1至9月的购销任务，降低了费用，增加了积累。这不是偶然的成就。巩固地树立为生产服务的观点，工商之间亲如一家，水乳交融，是同家梁商店能够做好矿区供应服务工作的一条重要经验。
    商业部门的工作人员具有坚定地为生产服务的观点，同工矿企业主管部门关心生产又关心生活的思想结合起来，直接在生产上所起的作用是很大的。从生产企业部门来说，搞好生产，就必须搞好职工生活，要搞好职工生活，就必须帮助商店搞好供应和服务工作。同家梁矿党委把商店看做是煤矿的一个组成部分，开会研究工作时，总是吸收商店领导人员参加，互通情况，共同研究；当商店有困难时，并竭力给予各种支持。当煤矿组织高产运动的时候，商店就组织宣传鼓动和慰问；当煤矿超额完成生产任务报喜时，同时也向商店报喜，工商双方互相鼓舞，互相促进。这里，充分说明了坚持政治挂帅，是搞好生产搞好生活的前提，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，脱离党的政治思想工作，要高速度发展生产，这是不可想像的。
    当前，工业战线上的广大职工，在党的领导下，发挥着冲天的革命干劲，正在为今年提前超额完成生产任务，为明年的继续跃进作好准备。在这种情况下，工矿区的商业职工，必须根据党的八届八中全会号召，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，立即开展一个学同家梁、赶同家梁、超同家梁的广泛深入的群众运动，力争在短时间内把工矿林区的商业工作水平大大提高一步。
