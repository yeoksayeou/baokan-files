    News from this newspaper: Wuhan's painters are engaging in creative work with great enthusiasm. Zhang Zhaoming, an old Chinese painter with silver hair, carried his luggage to the Danjiangkou Reservoir construction site to create works reflecting the magnificent Danjiangkou water conservancy project. He conducted careful tours and interviews on the construction site, which was full of flying sand, and lived among the working people for more than a month. After this period of effort, he collected a large amount of information and materials about the Danjiangkou Reservoir construction site, greatly enriching his creative themes. After returning to Wuhan, he immediately began intense sorting and processing work. Chinese painters Zhang Zhenduo and others also went to rural Macheng in Hubei and the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to experience life, preparing to create works reflecting China's great construction achievements and the spiritual outlook of the working people.

    Based on going deep into the masses and deep into life, a number of excellent works are constantly emerging. The oil painting "In the February 7th Old Workers' Club" by Liu Yiwen, a professor at the Wuhan Academy of Arts, vividly depicts the image of the old workers and is one of the excellent works that have appeared in Wuhan in recent years. The Chinese paintings "Myna and Broad Bean Flowers" by Zhang Zhenduo and "Weaving Rattan" by Wang Xiazhou are also excellent Chinese paintings recently completed.

    老画家的新作品
    本报讯　武汉市的画家们，正在满腔热情地从事创作。银发苍苍的老国画家张肇铭为了创造反映伟大的丹江水利工程面貌的作品，背着行李来到丹江水库工地。他在飞砂满天的工地上进行仔细的参观访问，并且深入到劳动人民中生活了一个多月。经过这一段时期的努力，他收集了有关丹江水库工地的大批资料和素材，使创作题材大为丰富。回到武汉市以后，他立即开始了紧张的整理加工工作。国画家张振铎等人也都先后深入到湖北麻城农村和长江三峡等地体验生活，准备创作出反映我国伟大建设成就和劳动人民精神面貌的作品。
    在深入群众、深入生活的基础上，一些优秀的作品正在不断地涌现出来。武汉艺术学院教授刘依闻创作的“在二七老工人俱乐部里”一幅油画，生动地描画了老工人的形象，是近年来武汉市出现的优秀作品之一，国画家张振铎的“八哥蚕豆花”、王霞宙的“扎藤”也是最近完成的优秀国画。
