　　Competition and Collaboration
    More than 300 factories in Changzhou have unleashed their potential and boosted their enthusiasm in the grand competition; the Kaishantun and Shixian paper mills have learned from each other in the competition, exchanging more than 300 advanced experiences, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. These facts vividly demonstrate that the grand competition is an important method to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, promote continuous production upsurges, and complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule.
    From the news of the competition between the Kaishantun Paper Mill and the Shixian Paper Mill, it can be seen that the process of competition is a process of mutual learning and mutual assistance. Competition, mutual learning, and collaboration are the characteristics of socialist labor competition under the guidance of communist ideology. To truly achieve competition, learning, and collaboration, both sides of the competition must give play to their initiative and enthusiasm, humbly learn from the experience of others, not wait for others to introduce it, but actively ask for advice from others, and the party that creates the experience does not wait for others to learn, but actively introduces and promotes it. When the two initiatives are combined, the advanced experience will spread. The same is true for collaboration. The two sides of the competition are opponents and brothers. To correctly handle the relationship between opponents and brothers, the two sides of the competition must be active, sincere, and cooperative. If one factory encounters difficulties, the two factories will work together to solve them with all their strength. Only in this way can they make a common leap forward and a common improvement.
    If thousands upon thousands of factories and mines promote the communist style and throw themselves into the torrent of collaborative competition, our leap forward pace will be bigger and more powerful!

　　竞赛协作
    常州市三百多个工厂在大比大赛中比出了潜力赛出了干劲；开山屯和石岘两个纸厂在竞赛中互相学习交流各种先进经验三百多条，劳动生产率因此大大提高。这些事实生动地证明：大比大赛是反右倾、鼓干劲，促进生产不断高涨，提前完成今年跃进计划的重要方法。
    从开山屯造纸厂和石岘造纸厂竞赛的消息中，可以看出竞赛的过程，就是互相学习、互相帮助的过程。竞赛、互相学习、协作，这是在共产主义思想指导下的社会主义劳动竞赛的特点。要真正作到又竞赛又学习又协作，竞赛的双方都得发挥主动性、积极性，虚心学习别人的经验，不是等着别人介绍，而是主动地向人家请教，创造经验的对方也不是坐等人家来学习，而是主动地介绍和推广，两个主动一结合，先进经验就传开了。协作也是如此，竞赛的双方是对手，又是兄弟，正确处理对手和兄弟的关系，竞赛的双方必须积极主动，真诚协作，一厂遇到困难两厂齐心全力地解决，只有这样，才能共同跃进，共同提高。
    千千万万的厂矿发扬共产主义风格，投入协作竞赛的洪流，我们的跃进步伐就会跨得更大、更有力！
