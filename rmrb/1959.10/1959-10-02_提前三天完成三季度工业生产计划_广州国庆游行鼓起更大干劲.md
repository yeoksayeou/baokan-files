Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 1st: Over 200,000 people in the central district of Guangzhou held a grand rally and parade, warmly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation. Today, the Martyr's Cemetery Square and the surrounding streets were a sea of red flags and flowers.

Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province, and other party and government leaders of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality reviewed the ranks of people from all walks of life from the rostrum in the square. Workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese, divided into more than a dozen columns, marched forward to be reviewed.

After the People's Liberation Army naval, land, and air forces stationed in Guangzhou and the militia teams passed the rostrum, tens of thousands of Guangzhou workers, with a glorious revolutionary tradition and having successfully completed their third-quarter production tasks three days ahead of schedule, marched valiantly at the front of the parade. The various charts and models they carried demonstrated the significant achievements Guangzhou has made in industry over the past decade, especially since last year. The workers of various factories who created these achievements with their own hands sang and danced during the parade, their spirits particularly high. Many factory workers shouted slogans, expressing their determination to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.

The peasant teams used various charts and physical objects to report their production achievements after communization to the Party with great joy. These members of the people's communes, who participated in the fight against the once-in-a-century flood in June this year, personally experienced that it was precisely because of the people's communes that they were able to successfully overcome the flood disaster and quickly recover. Therefore, they all shouted the slogan "Long live the people's communes!" excitedly.

Simultaneously with the rally and parade in the central square, the southern, western, central, and suburban districts of Guangzhou also held grand rallies and parades attended by tens of thousands of people. Today, the total number of people participating in rallies and parades in Guangzhou was approximately 500,000.

On the afternoon of the 30th, Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality convened a celebration meeting attended by 5,000 representatives from all walks of life, at which Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a report entitled "Cheering the Great Victory of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation." The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee also held a grand banquet to entertain foreign friends in Guangzhou.

    提前三天完成三季度工业生产计划
    广州国庆游行鼓起更大干劲
    新华社广州1日电　广州市中心区二十多万人举行盛大集会和游行，热烈庆祝建国十周年。今天，烈士陵园广场和广场附近的大街上，人山人海，织成了一片红旗和鲜花的海洋。
    中共广东省委第一书记陶铸、广东省省长陈郁和广东省、广州市其他党政负责人，在广场的主席台上检阅各界人民的队伍。接受检阅的工人、农民、革命知识分子、工商业者、华侨和侨眷，分成十几路纵队前进。
    人民解放军海陆空军驻广州部队和民兵队伍走过主席台以后，具有光荣革命传统、在三天前胜利完成第三季度生产任务的几万广州工人队伍，雄赳赳地走在游行队伍的前面。他们抬着的各种图表和模型，说明广州十年来特别是去年以来，在工业方面取得了重大的成就。去年全市的工业总产值比1949年增长近七倍，亲手创造这些成就的各厂工人，游行时载歌载舞，情绪特别热烈。许多工厂职工高呼口号，表示决心提前完成今年计划。
    农民队伍用各种图表和实物，兴高彩烈地向党汇报公社化后的生产成就。这些曾在今年六月间参加抗击百年一遇特大洪水袭击的人民公社社员们，都亲身体会到正是因为有了人民公社，才能胜利地战胜洪水灾害，并很快地恢复了元气。因此他们都激动地高呼着“人民公社万岁”的口号。
    与中心广场集会游行的同时，广州南区、西区、中区、郊区都分别举行几万人参加的盛大的集会和游行。今天广州市参加集会游行的总人数约在五十万人左右。
    30日下午，广东省和广州市召开了五千名各界代表参加的庆祝大会，由省委第一书记陶铸作了“欢呼建国十年的伟大胜利”的报告。省委和省人民委员会还举行了盛大宴会，招待在广州的外国朋友。
