Xinhua News Agency, 8th: This reporter reports: As the People's Republic of China celebrates its tenth anniversary, progressive people all over the world are elated, while the imperialists are trembling with fear.

The comments published by some important bourgeois newspapers in Western countries on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China cannot conceal their unease. American imperialists once declared that they regarded New China as a "temporary phenomenon," vainly attempting to "strangle New China in the cradle," and used all means such as military, political, and economic blockades to make New China "disappear." However, they now have to admit that their despicable attempts have failed.

An article published in the American "New York Times" on September 27 stated that ten years ago, the American idea that "the Chinese Communists were doomed to failure" was "an illusion," "the Chinese Communist government is ten years old," and "they are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs." A special article issued by United Press International on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of China also wrote that the Chinese people's "regime is strong and consolidated, and any hope that it will be overthrown in the near future is probably doomed to fail," and "contrary to the hopes of anti-communists," the "Communists will still sit firmly in power" in the future.

Bourgeois newspapers in Western countries point out with concern that New China has not only gained a firm foothold, but has also developed into a powerful country, making the balance of world power change in a way that is unfavorable to imperialism.

An editorial in the "New York Times" on October 1, entitled "Ten Years of Red China," stated that it would be "blind" to ignore the Chinese people's "government's growing military and economic power," and that the figures for China's agricultural and industrial output growth in recent years "prove the birth of a new modernized industrial country in Asia."

An article published in the British Conservative Party's organ "Daily Telegraph" on October 1 stated that "the Communist revolution of 1949 and the huge change in the concentration of world power it caused are still the main political events of the post-war era," "the first decade saw it (China) playing an increasingly important role in world affairs," and "the decisive aspect of the next decade may well be the emergence of China as a major industrial power," "for the West, the prospect is not particularly pleasant."

Although these bourgeois newspapers still try their best to mix in many distortions and slanders of China's situation in their comments, they have almost universally and helplessly admitted that tremendous changes have taken place in China's economic landscape over the past ten years. In the face of iron facts, more confusion and self-contradiction have appeared in the camp of slanderers. An article published in the "New York Times" said on the one hand that China's "production miracle in 1958 was only on paper," but on the other hand it wrote that "in material terms, the country has changed almost beyond recognition. Foreigners returning from China have found that the dangerous and interesting trips they remembered making in old China seem to belong to prehistoric times," and that "Communist China has made significant progress" in the economic field. The "Christian Science Monitor" editorial on October 2 stated that "whether we like it or not," "if we do not face the obvious fact that China's face has undergone changes to an extent that was previously considered impossible, we are seriously deceiving ourselves." A United Press International report talked a lot about the "failure of the Great Leap Forward" in China, while another report said, "The world had better pay attention" to the "speed" of China's development, "economically, the mainland has made great progress," and "what China can achieve with soaring energy in the coming years of the post-liberation era may be worth noting."

The British "Times," which still stubbornly described China's Great Leap Forward as a "Great Leap Backward" and "dim" in late August, cannot help but change its tone somewhat now. It said in its October 1 editorial that for the Chinese "who remember the past suffering, the change is tremendous. In places where they have never seen trucks or never seen electrical switches, life suddenly enters a new world of technological development," "the 'Made in China' label is affixed to goods that China could not have imagined manufacturing ten years ago," "especially the absolute need to increase food has so far been met." An article published in the "Daily Telegraph" on October 1 wrote that China's industrialization "efforts have made great progress," and "it is very likely to achieve its boast of surpassing Britain in the output of major products in ten years." The West German "Generalanzeiger" said in an editorial on October 3 entitled "The Awakened Giant" that "anyone who traveled to China before the war and still has some pictures in his memory that can be compared with the current situation of Chinese communism will be given an almost unimaginable impression. Today, the Communists have widely driven away hunger," "men and women are working for countless national construction projects, and a railway network has appeared throughout the country," "in the north, a Chinese Ruhr area has emerged." The West German "Süddeutsche Zeitung" also pointed out on October 1 that in the past ten years, "this huge country has begun to undergo unimaginable rapid changes. The driving force behind this change is the Communist Party."

### 在进步人类欢呼新中国伟大十年声中  帝国主义者胆战心惊

    在进步人类欢呼新中国伟大十年声中
    帝国主义者胆战心惊
    新华社8日讯　本社记者报道：在中华人民共和国度过它的十周年的日子里，全世界进步人类欢欣鼓舞，而帝国主义者则胆战心惊。
    西方国家一些重要的资产阶级报纸就中华人民共和国成立十周年发表的评论，无可掩饰地反映出他们的不安情绪。美帝国主义者曾经宣称把新中国看作是“暂时现象”，妄想把新中国“绞死在摇篮中”，并且使用了军事的、政治的和经济封锁等一切手段来促使新中国“消逝”。但是，他们现在不得不承认，他们的卑鄙企图失败了。
    美国“纽约时报”9月27日刊载的一篇文章说，十年前，美国人以为“中国共产党人注定要失败”的想法“是幻想”，“中国共产党政府十周年了”，“他们在国际事务中起着越来越重要的作用”。合众国际社在中国建国十周年时发出的专稿里也写道，中国人民“政权是强大的和巩固的，认为它会在最近将来被推翻的任何希望大概注定是要落空的”，“同反共人们的希望相反”，今后“共产党人还是会稳坐江山”。
    西方国家资产阶级的报纸忧心忡忡地指出，新中国不仅站稳了脚根，而且已经发展成为一个强大的国家，使世界力量对比发生不利于帝国主义的大变化。
    “纽约时报”10月1日发表的一篇题目是“红色中国的十年”的社论说，如果忽视中国人民“政权的日益增长的军事和经济力量，那是盲目的”，中国最近几年来在农业和工业产量方面增长的数字“证明亚洲的一个新的现代化工业国家诞生了”。
    英国保守党机关报“每日电讯报”10月1日刊载的一篇文章说，“1949年的共产党革命以及它所造成的世界力量的集结的巨大变化，仍然是战后年代的主要政治事件”，“在第一个十年看到了它（中国）在世界事务中起着越来越大的作用”，“今后十年的决定性方面很可能是中国作为一个重要工业强国出现”，“对西方来说，前景并不是特别令人愉快的”。
    尽管在这些资产阶级报纸的评论里仍然竭力渗杂着许多对于中国景况的歪曲和诽谤，但是它们已经几乎普遍地、无可奈何地承认，十年来中国的经济面貌发生了翻天复地的变化。在铁的事实面前，在诽谤者阵营里已经出现了更多的混乱和自相驳斥。“纽约时报”刊载的一篇文章一面说什么中国“1958年的生产奇迹只是纸上的”，另一面却写道，“从物质方面来说，这个国家改变得几乎认不得了。从中国回来的外国人发现，他们记忆中的在旧中国所作的既危险又有趣的旅行，似乎是属于史前时代的了”，在经济方面“共产党中国已经取得重大的进步”。“基督教科学箴言报”10月2日的社论说，“不管我们喜欢不喜欢”，“如果我们不正视这显然的事实，中国的面貌已经经历了在过去一直被认为不可能的那种程度的变化，我们就是严重地欺骗自己”。合众国际社在一篇报道里大谈中国“大跃进失败”，而在另外的报道里又说，“全世界最好还是注意”中国发展的“速度”，“在经济上，大陆已经取得巨大进展”，“在解放后时代的今后几年中，中国究竟能用冲天干劲取得什么成就，可能是值得注意的”。
    8月下旬还硬把中国大跃进说成是“大跃退”、“黯淡无光”的英国“泰晤士报”，现在也不能不多少改变腔调。它在10月1日的社论里说，中国“在那些记得过去苦难的人们看来，变化是巨大的。在从来没有见过卡车或者从来没有见过电气开关的地方，生活突然进入了一个技术发展的新天地”，“‘中国制’的标签贴在十年以前中国不可能想像会制造的货物上”，“尤其是增加粮食的绝对需要迄今已经得到满足”。“每日电讯报”10月1日刊载的文章写道，中国工业化的“努力已经取得了很大进展”，“它很可能实现它所夸耀的在十年内在主要产品产量方面超过英国”。西德“总汇报”10月3日在题为“觉醒了的巨人”的社论里说，“谁如果在战前去中国旅行过并且在他的记忆中还留下了几幅可以同中国共产主义现状作比较的图画，那么给他的印象简直是不可想像的。今天共产党人把饥饿广泛地驱逐了”，“男人、女人在为无数项的国家建设工作着，全国出现了一个铁路网”，“在北方，出现了一个中国的鲁尔区”。西德“南德意志报”10月1日也指出，十年来“这个巨大的国家开始发生不可想像的迅速变化。这种变化的原动力是共产党”。
