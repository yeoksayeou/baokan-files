Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th: Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commercial employees in Heilongjiang Province have launched a new upsurge in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. The total procurement value in the province in the third quarter increased by more than 14% compared to the second quarter.

Since late August, under the leadership of the Party committee, commercial departments have strengthened procurement teams, expanded procurement networks, and fully utilized the combination of regular procurement and concentrated procurement, as well as the combination of professional procurement and mass procurement, making procurement work very active. During the most intense period of procurement and the "hanging up hoes" period in the countryside, more than 50,000 professional procurement personnel were active in cities and villages, mountains and plains; approximately 500,000 people were engaged in diversified management, providing a large supply of goods for commercial departments.

Recently, Party committees in many places have further strengthened their leadership over procurement work. The Mudanjiang and Harbin Municipal Party Committees organized cadres to inspect the development of the procurement movement; Harbin also established specialized offices for peak season purchase and sale of non-staple foods, grain, coal, and vegetable transportation. These played an important role in guiding the in-depth development of the grassroots procurement movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is carrying out a mass-based concentrated purchasing campaign for agricultural products. More than 30,000 commercial cadres throughout the region went to communes and production brigades, seized the opportunity for procurement, relied on Party committees, mobilized the masses, and organized a procurement upsurge. The Dū'ān Yao Autonomous County mobilized 200,000 people to go to the mountains to launch a concentrated production effort of agricultural and sideline products, opening up a rich source of goods for agricultural product procurement. Longjin and Zuojiang counties organized mass concentrated procurement, acquiring more than 25,000 dan of charcoal, firewood, star anise, and other agricultural and sideline products, worth nearly 100,000 yuan, in just one day. To make it easier for commune members to sell, many areas have added purchasing stations along transportation routes. In the Yulin and Liuzhou prefectures alone, more than 750 were added.

While vigorously purchasing major agricultural products, commercial departments in various parts of Guangxi also seized the procurement of minor local specialties. The counties in Liuzhou Prefecture generally arranged for 15% to 20% of the labor force to go to the mountains to conduct concentrated collection of minor local specialties. As a result, they completed the third quarter's procurement plans for wild starch, tannin extract, and other wild raw materials ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th: Commercial departments in Hubei Province are vigorously purchasing local specialties during the peak season for the market entry of local specialties. The province's third-quarter procurement plans for major varieties such as tung oil and "pimu" oil (an important industrial raw material) have long been completed ahead of schedule, with procurement volume more than doubling compared to the same period last year. The Jingzhou Prefecture has also completed its annual procurement plan for local specialties ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, Party committees in various parts of Hubei, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, have further organized the masses to develop diversified management, which has further developed the production of local specialties.

Since August and September, commercial departments in various parts of Hubei have criticized the right-leaning emotions of some cadres, further boosted their energy, and adopted various measures to strengthen procurement work and improve procurement methods. In addition to increasing procurement points and using a combination of fixed-point procurement and mobile door-to-door procurement, they also universally established canteen purchasing stations and used social forces to conduct procurement on behalf of them, which not only facilitated the masses but also increased the procurement volume. While vigorously purchasing major local specialties, they also found rich wild raw material resources for industrial departments, procuring hundreds of thousands of dan of wild fibers, oils, starches, and tannin extract raw materials alone, supporting the production of papermaking, winemaking, and other daily-use industrial products.

    趁旺季大购农副产品
    黑龙江广西湖北依靠群众掀起收购新高潮
    据新华社哈尔滨5日电　黑龙江省商业职工在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，掀起了农副产品的采购新高潮。全省第三季度的采购总值，比第二季度增长14％以上。
    从8月下旬以来，商业部门在党委领导下加强了采购队伍，扩大了采购网，充分运用经常收购与突击收购相结合、专业收购与群众性收购相结合的方法，使采购工作十分活跃。在采购工作最紧张的时候和农村“挂锄”期间，全省有五万多名专业采购人员活跃在城市和乡村、山区和平原；大约有五十多万群众从事多种经营，为商业部门提供了大量货源。
    最近，许多地方的党委进一步加强了对采购工作的领导。中共牡丹江市委、哈尔滨市委都组织干部，检查了采购运动的发展情况；哈尔滨市还成立了副食品、粮食、煤炭旺季购销和蔬菜调运等专业办公室。这些对指导基层采购运动的深入发展起了重要作用。
    据新华社南宁5日电　广西僮族自治区开展群众性的农产品突击收购运动。全区有三万多名商业干部到公社和生产大队去，抓紧收购的时机，依靠党委，发动群众，组织收购高潮。都安瑶族自治县发动二十万人上山突击农副产品的生产，为农产品收购开辟了丰富的货源。龙津、左江两县组织群众性突击收购，仅一天就收购到二万五千多担木炭、木柴、八角及其他农副产品，产值近十万元。为了方便社员出售，很多地区在交通沿线增设了收购点。仅玉林、柳州两个专区就增设了七百五十多个。
    广西各地商业部门在大力收购大宗农产品的同时，也抓紧小宗土特产品的收购工作。柳州专区各县一般都安排15％到20％的劳动力上山突击采集小宗土特产品，结果，提前完成了第三季度的野生淀粉、栲胶等野生原料的收购计划。
    据新华社武汉5日电　湖北省商业部门在土特产品的上市旺季大力收购土特产品。全省桐油、皮木油（一种重要工业原料）等主要品种第三季度的收购计划，早已提前超额完成，收购量比去年同期增加一倍以上。荆州专区并且已经提前完成了全年的土特产品采购计划。
    今年以来，湖北各地党委在去年大跃进的基础上，进一步组织群众开展多种经营，使土特产品的生产又有发展。
    8、9月份以来，湖北各地商业部门批判了部分干部中的右倾情绪，进一步鼓足干劲，采取各种措施加强采购工作，改进收购方法。他们除了增加收购点，运用定点收购和流动上门收购相结合的办法以外，还普遍建立食堂代购站，运用社会力量代为收购，既便利了群众，又增加了收购量。在大力收购主要土特产品的同时，还为工业部门找到了丰富的野生原料资源，仅野生纤维、油料、淀粉和栲胶原料就收购了几十万担，支援了造纸、酿酒和其他日用工业品生产。（附图片）
