　　Display the Great Leap Forward Spirit and Vigorously Grasp the Three Autumn Tasks
　　Shandong's 15 Million Strong Army Operates on Multiple Fronts, Harvesting, Ploughing and Sowing Simultaneously
    Sichuan Advances Victoriously, Launching a Small Spring Crop Large-Area High-Yield Competition
    Anhui's Autumn Production Started Earlier, Progressed Faster and was of Better Quality than Last Year
    Jinan, October 12th (by our newspaper) - Shandong Province's Three Autumn campaign has fully reached a climax. The scale, speed, and quality of the campaign all exceed those of last year. Currently, over 30 million mu of early autumn crops in the province have been harvested, and 78 million mu of late autumn crops are beginning to be harvested; the area of autumn ploughed land has reached 50 million mu, and 40 million mu of early-sown wheat has been planted.

    From the east coast to the plains of western Shandong, from the Yimeng Mountains to the banks of the Yellow River, a scene of boiling Great Leap Forward spirit can be seen everywhere. Over 15 million able-bodied laborers throughout the province have devoted themselves to the Three Autumn campaign, operating on multiple fronts, harvesting, ploughing, and sowing simultaneously. Extensive "Seven Comparisons" red flag competitions are being launched between counties, communes, teams, groups, and even individuals, with technological innovation at the center, comparing vigor, increasing production measures, technological innovation, quality and progress, the extent of the Great Leap Forward, all incomes, and love for the country and the collective. Proposals, challenges, and pledges are plastered on walls and shelters. A surge of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced has already formed. After Shouzhang, Penglai, Licheng, and other nine counties and cities, as well as Xiyou, Taiqian and other five communes, and thirteen production brigades respectively initiated proposals for high-yield wheat competitions throughout the province, a wheat bumper harvest competition campaign spread throughout the province. Qihe, Pingyuan, Chiping, Linqing and other counties and cities, after participating in high-yield competitions between counties, in accordance with the spirit of boosting vigor and seeking truth from facts, have successively raised output targets and expanded the area of high-yield fields. These high-yield fields are all conscientiously achieving "Four-izations," namely, land leveling and paddy field-ization, standardized close planting and uniform sowing, popularization of superior varieties, and systematization of irrigation channels; and strictly implementing the "Five Guarantees," that is, guaranteeing deep ploughing and meticulous harrowing, applying ample base fertilizer, sowing over twenty catties of seeds, preventing and controlling pests and diseases during sowing, and timely sowing.

    Recently, Party committees at all levels have organized evaluation and inspection teams to go deep into the fields, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and mobilize the masses to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in a down-to-earth manner, in order to ensure the rapid development of the campaign. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held on-site meetings on wheat and water conservancy in Shouzhang County, promoting Shouzhang County's experience in wheat planting, such as leveling paddy fields, close planting and uniform sowing, selecting improved varieties, and systematizing irrigation channels, thus improving the quality of autumn sowing throughout the province.

    Chengdu, October 12th (by our newspaper) - Sichuan Province, on the basis of summarizing the experience of achieving high yields in small spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed this year, has launched a massive competition campaign for large-area high yields of small spring crops for next year. Millions of farmers are determined to further implement the policy of "planting more and harvesting more" and combining it with achieving large-area and high-yields on some land, conscientiously implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    This year, Sichuan Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of small spring crops. Compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the output of small spring food crops increased by 30%. After summarizing this year's successful experiences, the broad masses of farmers are full of confidence in achieving an even greater leap forward next year. Following the rapeseed high-yield counties of Zhongxian and Mianzhu initiating proposals for rapeseed high-yield competitions throughout the province, recently, Lezhi, Xichong, Pixian, Anyue, Nanbu and other five wheat high-yield counties have exchanged battle letters and launched a chain competition to seize high yields of wheat next year, and challenged all counties in the province. These counties plan to ensure another increase of 32.7% to 99.9% next year on the basis of increasing wheat production by 58.1% to 169% respectively this year; among them, Lezhi County also requires achieving a per mu yield of 1,000 jin on a large area. This challenge quickly aroused responses throughout the province, setting off a wave of friendly competition for high yields in small spring crops. The Mianyang Prefecture divided the 19 counties in the entire prefecture into six competition areas, with the prefectural party secretary and members going to each area to uniformly direct the competition. Led by Mianyang, Mianzhu, Zitong and Wangcang counties, the competition areas successively held Great Leap Forward mobilization rallies, revised targets, added measures, and widely launched yield increase competitions.

    In order to further implement the policy of "planting more, yielding high, and harvesting more," when formulating yield increase plans, all localities made overall plans for the production of wheat, rapeseed, and their preceding and succeeding crops, and made specific arrangements for planting plans on each piece of land according to local conditions. After mobilizing the masses for discussion and implementing them at all levels, the Xiangbi Commune in Yibin County adopted five measures, including expanding two-season fields, making full use of non-cultivated land, and expanding intercropping and relay planting, so that the planned planting area for small spring crops in the entire commune reached more than 8,300 mu, nearly three times more than last year. After mass discussions, the Nanchong Prefecture summarized specific methods for solving the problem of connecting preceding and succeeding crops by means of intercropping, strip cropping, and other cultivation methods, so as to ensure an all-round leap forward in large and small spring crops, and various crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds.

    In the high-yield competition campaign, all parts of Sichuan Province have paid great attention to using the high-yield experiences of wheat and rapeseed this year to guide next year's production, and more effectively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in light of local conditions. Lezhi, Xichong and other counties have decided to focus on several key yield-increasing links such as selecting improved varieties, deep ploughing of land, rational close planting, promoting narrow-row strip sowing, and applying sufficient base fertilizer. Many prefectures such as Wanxian, Daxian, Nanchong, and Neijiang have also summarized successful experiences in deep ploughing, rational close planting, etc. from the bottom up, and launched mass debates. They have formulated technical specifications for sowing small spring crops with close planting as the center, laying a good foundation for increasing the yield of small spring crops next year.

    At present, red flags are fluttering everywhere on the vast fields of Sichuan Province. Under the impetus of the competition campaign, various autumn planting tasks centered on deep ploughing and accumulating fertilizer have achieved great results. As of October 2nd, the autumn ploughed area in the province has reached more than 25.2 million mu, accounting for more than 60% of the area that should be ploughed, generally ploughing to a depth of eight inches to one foot. According to statistics on September 27th, 14 prefectures and cities have sown more than 2.01 million mu of rapeseed, and six prefectures and cities including Luzhou and Jiangjin have also sown more than 410,000 mu of small spring food crops.

    Hefei, October 12th (by our newspaper) - A large-scale autumn production upsurge has appeared in rural Anhui.

    This year's mid-season rice harvest in Anhui is nearing its end, and large-area bumper harvests have been generally achieved; spring sweet potatoes and soybeans have begun to be harvested; cotton is being picked. The people of all localities especially cherish the fruits of the bumper harvest seized from the "drought tiger's" mouth, so the harvesting work is done very carefully.

    Anhui Province's autumn ploughing and autumn sowing battle has also been fully launched. This year, the province's autumn planting area will expand to more than 58.8 million mu, an increase of more than 17 million mu over last year. By the end of September, the province had cultivated 17.24 million mu of land, more than 40% faster than the progress in the same period last year. Autumn sowing is earlier and faster, with more than 4 million mu already sown, more than 3 million mu more than in the same period last year. This year, due to thorough preparation and early action, the quality of autumn ploughing and autumn sowing is very good. In the main wheat-producing areas on both sides of the Huai River, preparations for autumn ploughing and autumn sowing were actively carried out two months ago. In July, the Bengbu Prefecture combined drought resistance and field management, and took measures to organize professional teams and combine them with shock tactics to prepare autumn sowing fertilizers, tools, and seeds. All localities have launched a large-scale high-yield movement as soon as autumn sowing begins, with about 30% or more of the autumn-sown fields being used as high-yield fields, and they are all connected in pieces. Shouxian plans to cultivate 730,000 mu of wheat 1,000-jin fields, accounting for 37.4% of the wheat sowing area. They organize professional teams to manage from sowing to harvesting.

    At present, a surging autumn production upsurge has begun to take shape in rural Anhui. Due to the early start of autumn ploughing and autumn sowing, a large-scale winter water conservancy campaign can be carried out ahead of schedule. While harvesting and sowing in autumn, management of late autumn crops is also strengthened, striving to exceed the original targets. (Shi Zhengzhang) (Attached picture)

　　拿出大跃进劲头　大抓三秋工作
　　山东一千五百万大军分线作战随收随耕随种
    四川乘胜前进掀起小春作物大面积高产竞赛
    安徽秋季生产比去年动手早进度快质量好
    本报济南12日电　山东省三秋运动全面形成高潮，运动的规模、速度、质量都超过了去年。现在，全省三千多万亩早秋作物已经收获完毕，七千八百万亩晚秋作物开始登场；秋翻地面积已达五千万亩，播种早茬麦四千万亩。
    从东海岸到鲁西平原，从沂蒙山到黄河边，到处是沸腾的跃进局面。全省一千五百多万名精壮劳力投入三秋运动，分线作战，随收、随耕、随种。县与县、社与社、队与队、组与组以至人与人之间，广泛地展开了以技术革新为中心内容。比干劲、比增产措施、比技术革新、比质量和进度、比跃进幅度、比各项收入、比爱国爱社的“七比”红旗竞赛，倡议书、应战书、决心书，贴满了墙壁和战棚，学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛已经形成了热潮。寿张、蓬莱、历城等九个县、市和西由、台前等五个公社以及十三个生产大队，分别向全省发起小麦高产竞赛倡议之后，小麦丰产竞赛运动遍及全省。齐河、平原、茌平、临清等县市参加县与县之间的丰产竞赛后，根据鼓足干劲和实事求是的精神，纷纷提高产量指标，扩大丰产方面积。这些丰产田都认真作到“四化”，即土地平整畦田化，密植匀播规格化，优良品种普及化，灌溉渠道系统化；并且严格执行了“五大保证”，即保证深耕细耙、多施底肥、播种量二十斤以上、播种时防治虫害、适时播种等。
    最近，各级党委都组织了评比检查组，深入田间，总结推广先进经验，发动群众踏踏实实地全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，以保证运动的迅速发展。中共山东省委在寿张县召开了小麦、水利现场会议，推广寿张县的平整畦田、密植匀播、选用良种、灌溉渠道系统化等种麦经验，使全省秋播质量有了新的提高。
    本报成都12日电　四川省在总结今年小麦、油菜等小春作物获得高产经验的基础上，掀起了声势浩大的为明年小春作物大面积高产竞赛运动。千百万农民决心进一步贯彻“多种多收”和在一部分地上实现大面积高额丰产相结合的方针，认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，力争实现明年农业生产的更大跃进。
    今年，四川省小春作物获得空前大丰收，与大跃进的1958年比较，小春粮食作物增产30％。广大农民总结今年丰收的经验后，对实现明年更大跃进充满信心。继油菜高产县忠县、绵竹向全省发起明年油菜高产竞赛倡议后，最近，乐至、西充、郫县、安岳、南部等五个小麦高产县又互下战表，开展了夺取明年小麦高产连环竞赛，并向全省各县提出挑战。这些县计划在今年小麦分别增产58.1％到169％的基础上，确保明年再增产32.7％至99.9％；其中，乐至县还要求达到大面积亩产一千斤。这一挑战迅速引起全省各地响应，掀起了小春高产友谊竞赛的热潮。绵阳专区把全区十九个县划为六个竞赛区，由地委书记、委员分别到各区统一指挥竞赛，以绵阳、绵竹、梓潼和旺苍等县为首，各竞赛区纷纷举行跃进誓师大会，修订指标，增添措施，增产竞赛广泛展开。
    为了进一步贯彻“多种高产多收”的方针，在制订增产计划时，各地对小麦、油菜及其前后作物的生产作了全面规划，因地制宜地将播种计划具体安排到每块田地。宜宾县象鼻公社在发动群众讨论、层层落实后，采用了扩大两季田、尽力利用非耕地、扩大间种套种等五项办法，使全社小春计划种植面积达到八千三百多亩，比去年增长近三倍。南充专区经过群众性讨论，总结出了套作、带作等栽培方式解决前后作物衔接问题的具体办法，以保证大、小春和粮、棉、油料等各种作物全面跃进。
    在高产竞赛运动中，四川省各地非常注意利用今年小麦、油菜高产经验，指导明年生产，更加切实地因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”。乐至、西充等县决定抓住选用良种、深耕土地、合理密植、推行窄幅条播、施足底肥等几个关键性增产环节。万县、达县、南充、内江等不少专区还从下而上地总结了深耕、合理密植等方面的成功经验，开展群众性大辩论。制订出了以密植为中心的小春作物播种技术规格，为明年小春增产打好基础。
    现在，在四川省广阔田野上，到处红旗招展。以深耕、积肥为中心的各项秋种工作，在竞赛运动推动下，已经取得很大成绩。截至10月2日止，全省秋耕面积已达二千五百二十多万亩，占应耕面积的60％以上，一般深耕八寸到一尺左右。据9月27日统计，有十四个专区和市已播种油菜二百零一万多亩，泸州、江津等六个专、市还播种了四十一万多亩小春粮食作物。
    本报合肥12日电　安徽全省农村出现了大规模的秋季生产高潮。
    今年安徽中稻收割已近尾声，普遍获得了大面积丰收；春甘薯、大豆已开始收获；棉花正在采摘。各地人民特别珍惜从“旱老虎”嘴里夺得的丰收果实，所以收打工作作得很细致。
    安徽全省秋耕秋种战役也已全面展开。今年全省秋种面积将扩大到五千八百多万亩，比去年增加了一千七百多万亩。到9月底，全省已耕地一千七百二十四万亩，比去年同期的进度快了40％以上。秋种更早更快，已种四百多万亩，比去年同期多三百多万亩。今年由于准备充分、动手早，秋耕秋种质量都很好。在淮河两岸的小麦主要产区，在两个月前就为秋耕秋种积极进行准备。蚌埠专区在7月份就结合抗旱和田间管理，采取组织专业队和突击相结合的办法，进行了秋种肥料、工具、种籽等的准备工作。各地在秋种开始就大搞大面积丰产运动，约有30％以上的秋种田作为丰产田，而且都是成片地连接起来的。寿县计划培养小麦千斤田七十三万亩，占小麦播种面积的37.4％。他们组织专业队，从种一直管理到收。
    目前，安徽农村一个万马奔腾的秋季生产热潮已开始形成。由于提早动手开展了秋耕秋种，这就可以提前进行规模巨大的冬季水利运动。在秋收秋种的同时，对晚秋作物也加强了管理，力争超过原定指标。　　　（石正章）（附图片）
