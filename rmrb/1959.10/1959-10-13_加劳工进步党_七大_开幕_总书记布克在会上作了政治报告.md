Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, October 9th: According to TASS, the Seventh Congress of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada opened in Toronto on the 9th. The Congress elected various committees and adopted the agenda.

    The General Secretary of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada, Tim Buck, delivered a political report at the congress.

    He said that the Canadian Communists are holding this congress at a time of profound and rapidly changing events in Canada and around the world. He said that the "brink of war" policy has been bankrupt, and this bankruptcy cannot be concealed. The "Cold War" is easing. New policies are emerging. There is reason to believe that we are on the road to widespread recognition of the policy of peaceful coexistence.

    Buck focused on the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States.

    Buck expressed his deep conviction that the peace-loving people of the United States and Canada are capable of defeating the advocates of the "Cold War." He said, "Peace-loving democratic people and groups can stop the 'Cold War' and achieve victory by relying on the policy of peaceful coexistence."

    "Such a policy is urgently needed in Canada today. This policy is essential to save our country. With this policy, Canadians can eliminate unemployment and end the one-sided development of the national economy caused by the 'Cold War'."

    Speaking of Khrushchev's proposal to the United Nations General Assembly for complete and thorough disarmament, Buck said that this proposal meets the urgent demands of millions upon millions of sensible people around the world, and also meets the highest ideal of mankind—a world without war.

    Buck said that Canada's policies should adapt to the new situation in international relations and the increasing changes in this relationship.

    Buck called on all Canadians to support Khrushchev's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

    In the last part of his political report, Buck talked about domestic issues and the tasks of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada in solving these problems.

    After the report, the congress read out congratulatory messages from fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam, and many other countries.

　　加劳工进步党“七大”开幕
    总书记布克在会上作了政治报告
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社多伦多9日讯：加拿大劳工进步党第七次代表大会9日在多伦多开幕。代表大会选出了各委员会和通过了议程。
    加拿大劳工进步党总书记蒂姆·布克在大会上作了政治报告。
    他说，加拿大共产党人举行这次代表大会正值加拿大国内和全世界发生深刻而迅速的剧烈变化的时期。他说，“战争边缘”政策已经遭到破产，而且这种破产是无法掩盖的。“冷战”正在缓和。新的政策正在产生。有理由相信，我们正走在和平共处政策得到广泛承认的路上。
    布克着重谈到了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在美国的具有历史意义的访问。
    布克表示深信，美加两国爱好和平的人民有能力战胜‘冷战’的鼓吹者。他说，“爱好和平的民主的人民和团体能够制止‘冷战’并依靠和平共处政策取得胜利。
    “这样的政策是加拿大目前迫切需要的。这种政策是拯救我国所必须的。有了这种政策，加拿大人就能够消除失业现象，结束由于‘冷战’而引起的国家经济的片面发展。”
    布克在谈到赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议时说，这个建议符合全世界千千万万有理智的人的迫切要求，同时也符合人类最崇高的理想——没有战争的世界。
    布克说，加拿大的政策应该适应国际关系中的新形势，适应这种关系中日益发展的变化。
    布克号召所有加拿大人支持赫鲁晓夫关于全面和彻底裁军的建议。
    布克在政治报告的最后一部分谈到了国内问题和加拿大劳工进步党在解决这些问题方面的任务。
    报告结束后，大会宣读了来自苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、印度、越南和许多其他国家兄弟共产党和工人党的贺电。
