    Waves of Struggle
    “Let them have something to eat”
    The major strike by the American steelworkers has persisted for more than three months. The steel magnates originally intended to force the workers into submission through starvation, but the steelworkers have received strong support from many brotherly trade unions and are in high spirits. Workers in thirty industries, large and small, including lead, zinc, copper, docks, and shipyards, have also launched strikes one after another. The United Automobile Workers even put forward the resounding slogan of supporting the steelworkers: “Let them have something to eat.” The Cleveland branch of the United Automobile Workers first raised a sum of money from its members, bought a large truckload of food, and delivered it to a local steelworkers' union. Many other unions have taken similar actions, which has greatly encouraged the striking steelworkers.
    “Drive the fat pigs out of the trough!”
    Thomas Patton, General Manager of the Republic Steel Corporation in the United States, slandered the steelworkers' demands for increased wages and improved welfare benefits as so-called "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs." However, the steelworkers cited figures published by Thomas Patton himself, illustrating the Republic Steel Corporation's staggering profits, and said: "We are not killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. We are just driving the fat pigs out of the trough!"
    A Reply to the "Defender"
    The newspaper "Defender," run by a large steel company in Youngstown, Ohio, spares no effort in touting the "benefits" enjoyed by workers who do not join the union. Not long ago, the "Defender" devoted its entire front page to reporting that workers at the Weirton Steel Company in West Virginia were "earning $1.8 million a week, while workers at other steel companies are idle."
    However, this so-called "benefit" of the capitalists cannot tempt anyone, and the vast majority of steelworkers scoff at it. Their response to the "Defender" is: persist in the strike! As a result, steel production has plummeted, dealing a huge blow to the steel bosses. The third quarter of the year saw the lowest steel production in the United States since 1939, with only over 8.2 million tons, while the US steel production in the first half of this year was 64.3 million tons.
          A Voice of Solidarity
    The American steelworkers' strike has raised the awareness of American workers and inspired their fighting spirit. When the Illinois AFL-CIO held its annual meeting in Chicago with 2,500 representatives from 1.25 million members, US Senator Paul Douglas delivered a lengthy speech attempting to defend anti-labor laws, but people ignored him. Some representatives righteously condemned the steel industry capitalists' consistent anti-labor conspiracy. Many representatives expressed their determination to unite and support striking workers in various industries. The annual meeting finally passed a resolution demanding that Eisenhower not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to deal with the striking steelworkers.

    斗争的浪花
    “让他们有东西吃”
    美国钢铁工人的大罢工，已经坚持三个多月了。钢铁大王原想以饥饿迫使工人屈服，但钢铁工人得到了许多兄弟工会的大力支援，斗志昂扬。铅、锌、铜业、码头、船坞等大小三十个行业的工人，也纷纷举行罢工。联合汽车工人工会还提出了支援钢铁工人的响亮口号：“让他们有东西吃”。克利夫兰的联合汽车工人工会首先从会员中募集了一笔钱，购买了一大卡车的食物，送交当地的一个钢铁工人工会。许多其他的工会都采取了同样的行动，这给了钢铁罢工工人以莫大的鼓舞。“把肥猪从槽里赶出来！”
    美国共和钢铁公司总经理汤麦斯·帕东诬蔑钢铁工人提出增加工资、改善福利待遇的要求，是所谓“杀鸡取卵”。但是，钢铁工人引用汤麦斯·帕东自己公布的数字，说明共和钢铁公司获得了惊人的利润，并说：“我们并没有杀鸡取卵。我们只是把肥猪从槽里赶出来！”
    给“辩护者”的回答
    俄亥俄州约斯顿城一家大钢铁公司举办的报纸“辩护者”，竭力吹嘘没有参加工会的工人所得到的“好处”。不久以前，“辩护者”以整个第一版报道西弗吉尼亚州威尔顿钢铁公司工人“一个星期收入一百八十万美元，而其他钢铁公司的工人都闲散着。”
    但是，资本家的这个所谓“好处”，引诱不了什么人，绝大多数钢铁工人都嗤之以鼻。他们回答“辩护者”的是：坚持罢工！结果，钢铁产量锐减，给了钢铁老板以巨大的打击。第三季度美国钢产量只有八百二十多万吨，是1939年以来产量最低的第三季度，而今年上半年美国的钢产量是六千四百三十万吨。
          团结的声音
    美国钢铁工人罢工的斗争，提高了美国工人的觉悟，鼓舞了他们的斗志。伊利诺州劳联—产联工会一百二十五万会员的二千五百名代表，在芝加哥举行年会时，美国参议员保罗·道格拉斯发表了长篇演说，企图为反劳工法进行辩护，可是人们并没有理睬他。有的代表理直气壮地抨击了钢铁工业资方反劳工的一贯的阴谋。许多代表表示要团结一致，支持各种行业的罢工工人。年会最后并通过决议要求艾森豪威尔不援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法案来对付罢工的钢铁工人。
