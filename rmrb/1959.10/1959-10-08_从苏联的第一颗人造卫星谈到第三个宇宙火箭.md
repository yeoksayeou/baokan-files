    October 4th of this year marks the second anniversary of the Soviet Union's launch of its first artificial Earth satellite. In these short two years, we have witnessed the high-speed development and brilliant achievements of Soviet science.

    The launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite marked the beginning of a new era for mankind in further conquering nature.

    Just one month after the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, on November 3, 1957, the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite went into space. Then, on May 15, 1958, the Soviet Union launched its third artificial Earth satellite.

    We know that the scientific and technological requirements for launching satellites increase dramatically with the increase in satellite weight. The weight of the three satellites increased one after the other, and the scientific research tasks became more massive and complex.

    More than half a year after the Soviet Union launched the third artificial Earth satellite, on January 2, 1959, it achieved even greater and more glorious victory, launching a huge cosmic rocket weighing about one and a half tons into space, freeing it forever from the shackles of Earth's gravity. The scope of human activity began to expand into the vast universe.

    The successful launch of the first cosmic rocket marked mankind's entry into the space age; it opened up broad prospects for interstellar travel. Its birth was by no means accidental, just as Professor Dubronravov, a Soviet scientist, said: "It is the inevitable development of some outstanding achievements made by the Soviet Union in conquering the universe in recent years."

    On September 14, 1959, the second cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union reached the surface of the moon. This was the first time in human history that a flight from Earth to another celestial body had been completed.

    The most prominent feature of the second cosmic rocket is not only that its speed exceeded the second cosmic velocity and its weight increased compared with the first rocket, but also that the last stage of the rocket was automatically controlled, and all the complex navigation equipment was installed on the last stage. This fully demonstrates the high level and rapid development of Soviet automatic control technology.

    Just as our people were celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, on October 4th, the second anniversary of the launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite, the third cosmic rocket was successfully launched, and the first automatic interplanetary station was established. This marks that the Soviet Union has reached a new stage and ascended to a new peak in rocket technology, especially in automatic control, remote measurement, and remote control, making a great contribution to mankind's conquest of the universe.

    From the communiqué about the third cosmic rocket, we can see that it was launched with a multi-stage rocket. The last stage obtained the predetermined speed and sent the automatic interplanetary station into the required orbit. The automatic interplanetary station is equipped with many scientific instruments to conduct extensive scientific research in outer space. The automatic interplanetary station weighs 278.5 kilograms, and the energy equipment and measuring instruments weigh 156.5 kilograms, so its effective weight is 435 kilograms. This automatic interplanetary station will fly past the moon and take the first pictures of the far side of the moon that anyone has ever seen.

    One of the main problems in space exploration is navigation. And accuracy is the main parameter affecting the design of the navigation system structure. As some scientists have pointed out, to put a rocket into a predetermined orbit, it is necessary to strictly control the speed and direction. To launch a satellite into an arbitrary orbit, the error requirement is about 1%; to launch a satellite with a precise orbit, the error requirement is about 0.1%. If launching a rocket flying to the moon, if it is allowed to collide with any point on the moon, the error requirement is about 0.05%. If it is required to collide with the lunar surface with a diameter of 200 kilometers, the error requirement is about 0.02%. If it is to return to the Earth's zone around the moon, its error must reach 0.005%. The automatic interplanetary station of the Soviet Union's third cosmic rocket returned to the Earth's zone around the moon. It can be seen that the Soviet Union has improved the accuracy of launching rockets by at least ten times in just two years, which is an extremely amazing achievement. As Soviet science journalists said: "The establishment of an automatic interplanetary station is the fourth most outstanding achievement in the history of conquering the universe, following the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, the first artificial solar planet, and the first lunar rocket."

    The three artificial Earth satellites and three cosmic rockets launched by the Soviet Union have made extremely important contributions to the study of the ionosphere, cosmic rays, solar radiation, Earth's magnetic field, lunar magnetic field, radiation belts around the Earth, micrometeorites, and biological physiology in the high altitude, and have achieved very rich results.

    In stark contrast to the Soviet Union is the United States' multiple failures. The United States has officially launched artificial Earth satellites as many as fourteen times, but only five launches have been successful. The weight of each satellite is very small. The total weight of the five satellites is only one-fourteenth of the weight of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite. From August 1958 to December 1958, the United States attempted to launch the "world's first" artificial lunar satellite with a medium-range rocket in the hope of luck, but the result was that four consecutive launches failed. It was not until early March of this year, that is, two months after the Soviet Union launched its first cosmic rocket, that it launched a so-called "cosmic rocket" weighing five kilograms. When passing through the lunar region, the rocket was more than 60,000 kilometers away from the moon (the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket was 6,000 kilometers away from the moon). Because of its small weight, it could only carry a few instruments, and several were malfunctioning, and the signals sent were unclear.

    In the past two years, the rapid development and brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in conquering the universe not only show that the Soviet Union's rocket technology far surpasses that of the United States and that the Soviet Union has the most powerful rocket technology in the world, but also prove the high level of the Soviet Union in many major disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, astronomy, radio electronics, automation and telemechanics, and metallurgy. Because the Soviet Union has the latest research equipment and highly theoretical scientific research work and is combined with advanced and powerful industry, three artificial Earth satellites and three cosmic rockets have been produced.

    Under the leadership and encouragement of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers have established magnificent feats, showing the world the power of the creative genius of the people, and illustrating the superiority of the socialist system.

    We fully believe that the great Soviet people and Soviet scientists will achieve more brilliant achievements and make greater contributions in conquering the universe.

    从苏联的第一颗人造卫星谈到第三个宇宙火箭
    中国科学院自动化及远距离操纵研究所筹备委员会副主任  武汝扬
    今年的10月4日是苏联发射第一颗人造地球卫星的两周年。在这短短的两年时间里，我们看到了苏联科学的高速度发展和取得的光辉成就。
    苏联第一颗人造地球卫星的发射，开始了人类进一步征服自然界的新纪元。
    第一颗人造地球卫星发射后刚过一个月，在1957年11月3日，苏联的第二颗人造地球卫星又上了天。接着，在1958年5月15日苏联又发射了第三颗人造地球卫星。
    我们知道，发射卫星对科学和技术的要求，随着卫星重量的加大而急剧增加。三颗卫星的重量一个比一个大，科学研究任务也一个比一个更加庞大和复杂。
    苏联发射了第三颗人造地球卫星以后半年多的时间，在1959年1月2日又取得了更大的、更辉煌的胜利，把一只巨大的、约一吨半重的宇宙火箭射入太空，使它永远脱离了地球引力的羁绊。人类活动的范围开始扩大到茫茫的宇宙。
    第一个宇宙火箭的发射成功，标志着人类已进入了星空时代；它为人类开辟了星际航行的广阔前途。它的诞生决不是偶然的，正像苏联科学家杜布隆拉沃夫教授所说：“它是近年来苏联在征服宇宙方面的一些卓越成就的必然发展。”
    1959年9月14日苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭到达了月球的表面。这就是人类在历史上第一次完成了从地球到另一个天体的飞行。
    第二个宇宙火箭最突出的不仅是它的速度超过了第二宇宙速度，重量比第一个火箭增加了，而且这只火箭的最后一级是自动控制的，全部复杂的导航设备都装在最后一级上，这充分显示出苏联自动控制技术的高度水平和迅速的发展。
    正当我国人民欢度伟大祖国建国十周年的时候，在苏联第一颗人造地球卫星发射两周年的10月4日又成功地发射了第三个宇宙火箭，并且建立了第一个自动行星际站。这标志着苏联在火箭技术方面，特别是在自动控制、遥远测量、遥远控制方面达到了一个新的阶段，登上了一个新的高峰，对人类征服宇宙又作了巨大的贡献。
    从有关第三个宇宙火箭的公报中可以看到，这次是用多级火箭发射的，最后一级获得了预定的速度，已经把自动行星际站送到所要求的轨道上去了。自动行星际站上装有很多科学仪器，用来在宇宙空间进行广泛的科学研究。自动行星际站重二百七十八点五公斤，能源设备和测量仪器重一百五十六点五公斤，所以它的有效重量共达四百三十五公斤。这个自动行星际站将绕过月球飞行，并第一次拍摄下任何人从未看到过的月球背面的情况。
    空间探索的主要问题之一，是导航问题。而准确度又是影响设计导航系统结构的主要参数。正像有些科学家所指出的那样，为了把火箭送入预定的轨道，要求严格控制速度和方向。要发射一个任意轨道的卫星，它的误差要求在1％左右；要发射一个具有精确轨道的卫星，它的误差要求在0.1％左右。如果发射向月球飞行的火箭，如允许与月球上的任何一点相碰时，误差要求在0.05％左右。如果要求与月球相碰在二百公里直径的月球表面，就要求误差在0.02％左右。如果要使它绕月球返回地球区，它的误差就要达到0.005％。而苏联第三个宇宙火箭的自动行星际站就是绕过月球返回地球区的。可见，苏联在短短的两年内已经把发射火箭的准确度提高了至少十倍以上，这是一个极其惊人的成就。正像苏联的科学记者所说：“建立自动行星际站是在征服宇宙的历史上，继发射第一个人造地球卫星、第一个人造太阳行星和第一个月球火箭之后的第四个最卓越的成就。”
    苏联发射的三颗人造地球卫星、三个宇宙火箭对高空中的电离层、宇宙线、太阳辐射、地球磁场、月球磁场、地球周围辐射带、微流星和生物生理等的研究都作了极重要的贡献，取得了非常丰富的成果。
    与苏联成为显明对照的是美国的多次失败。美国正式发射人造地球卫星达十四次之多，但只有五次发射成功。每颗卫星的重量都很小，五颗卫星的重量加在一起，也只有苏联第三颗人造地球卫星重量的十四分之一。从1958年8月到1958年12月美国曾企图侥幸用中程火箭发射“世界上第一个”人造月球卫星，但结果连续发射四次都遭到了失败。只在今年3月初，即在苏联发射第一个宇宙火箭两个月以后，才发射了一个五公斤重的所谓“宇宙火箭”。在通过月球区域时，火箭离月球竟达六万多公里（苏联第一个宇宙火箭距月球六千公里）。由于它的重量太小，只能携带几件仪器，还有几件失灵，发的信号也不清楚。
    两年来，苏联在征服宇宙方面的飞跃发展和所取得的光辉成就不仅说明了苏联的火箭技术远远地超过了美国，苏联拥有世界上最强大的火箭技术，而且证明了苏联在很多主要学科如数学、物理、化学、力学、天文学、无线电电子学、自动与远动学、冶金等方面的高度水平。由于苏联拥有最新研究设备和高度理论的科学研究工作并与先进的、强大的工业相结合，才产生了三颗人造地球卫星和三个宇宙火箭。
    在伟大的苏联共产党的领导和鼓舞下，苏联的科学家、工程师和工人们建立了雄伟的功勋，向全世界表明了人民的创造天才的力量，说明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    我们完全相信，伟大的苏联人民和苏联科学家将在征服宇宙方面取得更辉煌的成就，作出更大的贡献。
