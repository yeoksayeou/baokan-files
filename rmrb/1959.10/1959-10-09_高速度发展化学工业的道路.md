The Path to High-Speed Development of the Chemical Industry
Vice Minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry Wu Liping
(Continued from yesterday)

	Resolutely manage the established "small-scale, indigenous groups"; massively establish medium-sized and small chemical enterprises; vigorously develop chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" or "small-scale, foreign groups"; achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

	Currently, our task is to resolutely manage the established "small-scale, indigenous groups." For units with abnormal production, we must seize the time to resolve specific technical problems in production. If the design is incomplete, we must expedite design modifications. We must ensure that all "small-scale, indigenous groups" established are technically sound by the end of this year, creating "models" for widespread promotion next year.

	Can the "small-scale, indigenous groups" pass the economic test? The so-called "failure to pass the economic test" simply means that costs are high and profits cannot be made. It is obviously unfair to demand that the production costs of small enterprises and indigenous methods be the same as those of large enterprises and foreign methods. Because "small-scale, indigenous groups" generally use fewer machines, relying mainly on manual operations, labor productivity is relatively low, and raw material and fuel consumption quotas are relatively high, it is natural that costs are higher. Of course, it should be affirmed that the potential for "small-scale, indigenous groups" to reduce costs is still very large. As long as normal production can be guaranteed, avoiding intermittent operation, efforts are made to improve business management, sites are rationally selected, resources are comprehensively utilized, and manpower is saved as much as possible, then costs can certainly be greatly reduced. In fact, many small sulfuric acid plants originally had high production costs, but after hard work, they have been greatly reduced, turning losses into profits. At the same time, when calculating economic accounts, we should also consider the larger picture: the "small-scale, indigenous groups" require less investment, yield quick results, support industry and agriculture, develop production, and increase overall social wealth, while preparing the technical and organizational conditions for the future large-scale development of the chemical industry. We should also consider the significant benefits of "small-scale, indigenous groups" in terms of local sourcing of materials, local production, and local use, which can save transportation costs and packaging expenses. If a comprehensive account is made, it can be affirmed that the economic test of "small-scale, indigenous groups" is completely passable.

	The chemical industry is an industrial sector that serves agriculture, industry, transportation, culture, education, health, and all aspects of people's lives. Its support for agriculture is particularly prominent and important. Although China's chemical industry has made significant progress and leaps forward in the past ten years, it still appears somewhat backward compared to the rapidly increasing needs for chemical products in industry and agriculture, due to its poor foundation and has become one of the weak links in China's national economy. China's socialist construction cause is making a great leap forward this year, and it will continue to leap forward in the future. The development of agriculture requires large amounts of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and rubber products. The development of industry and transportation requires large amounts of acids, alkalis, and organic products. The increasing improvement of people's lives requires more and more chemical products. In order to meet the rapidly growing needs of all aspects, we must further exert our efforts and do everything possible to catch up with the chemical industry as soon as possible. On the one hand, we must accelerate the construction of more large-scale enterprises to establish the backbone of the chemical industry, which of course cannot be neglected in the slightest. However, the construction of large-scale enterprises generally requires a long time and requires more investment, materials, and equipment, making it difficult to solve the urgent needs of this year and next year. Moreover, relying solely on the construction of large-scale enterprises cannot completely meet the massive needs. Therefore, the fastest and most effective way to develop the chemical industry in line with the current situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture is to, under the unified arrangement of the national plan and the strong leadership of local party committees, massively establish medium-sized and small chemical enterprises, vigorously develop chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" or "small-scale, foreign groups," and continue to launch a mass movement to fully mobilize local enthusiasm and launch a new upsurge of mass-based chemical industry development throughout the country.

	Experience over the past year or so has proven that as long as the mysterious views on running the chemical industry are completely broken, and the style of daring to think, speak, and act is continued, almost all chemical products can be produced by "small-scale, indigenous groups" or "small-scale, foreign groups," even the synthetic ammonia industry and organic products with higher technical requirements are no exception. For example, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, synthetic ammonia, phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer, furfural, alcohol, calcium carbide, synthetic rubber, organosilicon, epoxy resin, polyethylene, styrene, and other important chemical products can all be produced by "small-scale, indigenous groups" or "small-scale, foreign groups." Of course, our advocacy of "small-scale, indigenous groups" does not mean that the more indigenous and smaller the better. Some products are suitable for production using the "small-scale, indigenous groups" method, while others (such as synthetic ammonia) are suitable for "small-scale, foreign groups"; some products are suitable for building small factories, while others are suitable for building medium-sized factories. In short, it is necessary to adapt to the different conditions of various products, adapt to local conditions, and correctly implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises.

	The chemical industry is an industry that can comprehensively utilize various material resources, and chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" can greatly leverage this feature. Vigorously developing "small-scale, indigenous groups" can fully utilize local agricultural product resources and industrial and agricultural by-products, and fully utilize small, dispersed mineral resources, opening up multiple sources of raw materials. For example, using rice husks to produce furfural, using rice bran to produce alcohol and acetic acid, using waste molasses from sugar factories to produce acetone and butanol, using sweet potatoes to produce glucose and alcohol, using wood dry distillation to produce calcium acetate, acetic acid, and methanol, using castor oil to produce octanol and sebacic acid (raw material for nylon), and so on. The comprehensive utilization of earth nitrate can produce six or seven chemical products. The utilization of resources such as pyrite, mirabilite, and table salt can produce a variety of chemical products. Mineral resources such as phosphate rock, serpentine, potassium feldspar, and peat are widely distributed in our country and can be widely used to produce chemical fertilizers. Running medium-sized and small calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants can be combined with self-operated low-temperature coking, which can both obtain semi-coke for the manufacture of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer and obtain products such as coal tar and synthetic petroleum. China's agricultural and sideline product resources are becoming increasingly abundant, and their comprehensive utilization can not only greatly increase the economic value of agricultural products, but also greatly increase commune income and promote the industrialization of communes. Over the past year, the mass investigations conducted to vigorously develop "small-scale, indigenous groups" have proven that chemical mineral resources are very abundant in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. The infinite abundance and wide distribution of natural resources are a very favorable condition for the widespread establishment of medium-sized and small chemical plants.

	Chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" are not just small and insignificant, but have great potential. It is not just to increase the supply of urgently needed chemical products now (of course, this is very important), but more importantly, it opens up new and broad paths for the development of China's chemical industry and greatly accelerates the development speed of China's chemical industry. The experience of vigorously developing "small-scale, indigenous groups" last year proves that mobilizing the masses to run the chemical industry is many times faster than a few people in the industrial sector running the chemical industry. The consolidated and rectified "small-scale, indigenous groups" and "small-scale, foreign groups" have become an important part of China's chemical industry. Today they are "small-scale, indigenous groups," but there is no doubt that tomorrow there will be a large number of small, medium, and even large-scale modern chemical enterprises. With a large number of "small-scale, indigenous groups" or "small-scale, foreign groups," we have a base for cultivating talents and a position for continuing to move forward. Relying on this position, we can greatly accelerate the leap forward pace of the chemical industry. The structure of China's chemical industry must not only include large-scale enterprises today, but also include medium-sized and small enterprises in the future, and must be a complete system that combines large, medium, and small enterprises. With a large number of medium-sized and small enterprises, the distribution of China's chemical industry will gradually become more reasonable. At that time, not only will there be many chemical plants in several large coastal cities, but also a large number of chemical plants will appear in the inland areas; each province, city, and autonomous region will not only have a group of backbone chemical plants, but also a group of medium-sized and small chemical plants; not only large cities will have chemical plants, but also medium-sized and small cities, special districts, counties, and people's communes will have chemical plants of varying scales. Only in this way can it be said that the policy of全民办工业, 全民办化学工业 (all people running industry, all people running the chemical industry) advocated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong has been relatively completely realized.

	We firmly believe that adhering to and implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" will not only enable us to achieve a great leap forward in the chemical industry this year, but also enable us to achieve a continuous great leap forward in the chemical industry in the future. We must seize the time to do a good job in making "models" this year, make technical preparations, and vigorously cultivate technical forces, so as to create the necessary conditions for vigorously developing chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" next year. We believe that the chemical "small-scale, indigenous groups" movement next year will definitely be better developed, so that China's chemical industry can better and more quickly adapt to the requirements of the great leap forward of China's entire national economy.

	At this time when the whole country is jubilantly and warmly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, all the employees on our chemical industry front are determined to persevere in the massive mass movement that has already formed, determined to do everything possible to ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's production and construction plans, achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and strive to complete all the chemical products included in the second five-year plan according to the 1962 targets set by the Eight Congress, First Session in 1960.

    高速度发展化学工业的道路
    化学工业部副部长　吴黎平
    （续昨）
    切实办好已经建立起来的“小土群”；大量举办化工中的中型和小型企业；大搞化工的“小土群”或“小洋群”；实现今年更大更全面的跃进
    目前，我们的任务，就是要把已经建立起来的“小土群”切实办好，对于生产不正常的单位，必须抓紧时间，解决生产技术上的具体问题。设计不完备的，就抓紧修改设计。一定要在今年年底前，使已经办起来的“小土群”过好技术关，为明年大量推广做好“样板”。
    “小土群”能不能过经济关呢？所谓“不能过经济关”，无非是指成本高了，不能赚钱。如果要求小型企业、土法生产的产品成本，同大型企业、洋法生产的产品成本一样，那显然是不公平的。因为“小土群”一般地使用机器较少，主要还是靠手工操作，劳动生产率比较低，原料和燃料的消耗定额比较高，成本比较高一些是很自然的。当然，应当肯定，“小土群”降低成本的潜力还是很大的。只要能够保证正常生产，不要时停时开，努力改善经营管理，合理选择厂址，综合利用资源，尽可能节省人力，那么成本是一定可以大大降低的。事实上，许多小型硫酸厂原来生产成本较高，经过努力，已经大大降低，由赔钱转为赚钱。同时，我们在算经济账的时候，更应该算一算“小土群”投资少，见效快，支援工业、农业，发展生产，增加社会总财富，同时为化工往后大发展开辟宽广道路准备好技术组织条件等等的大账，也要算一算“小土群”可以就地取材、就地生产、就地使用，可以节省运输力量和包装费用的重大利益。如果全面算账，可以肯定的说，“小土群”的经济关，是完全过得去的。
    化学工业是为农业、工业、交通、文教卫生、人民生活各方面服务的一个工业部门，对于农业的支援，尤为突出和重要。十年以来，我国化学工业虽已有了重大的发展和跃进，但是由于化学工业原来底子太差，并且工农业各方面对于化工产品的需要，增加得特别迅速，所以化学工业相形之下就显得有些落后，成为现在我国国民经济中的薄弱环节之一。我国社会主义建设事业，今年是大跃进，今后也将继续跃进。农业的发展，需要大量的化学肥料、农药和橡胶制品。工业和运输业的发展，需要大量的酸碱和有机产品。人民生活的日益提高，需要越来越多的化工产品。为了满足各方面迅速增长的需要，我们必须进一步鼓足干劲，千方百计使化学工业尽快地赶上去。一方面，我们必须加快建设更多的大型企业，建立化学工业的骨干，这点当然是不能丝毫忽视的。但建设大型企业，一般需要较长的时间，需要较多的投资和材料、设备，要解决今年、明年的急需，是困难的。而且单靠大型企业的建设，也还不能完全满足大量的需要。因此，同当前工业、农业大跃进的形势相适应的、发展化学工业的最快、最有效的方法，就是在国家计划的统一安排、各地党委的有力领导之下，大量举办化工的中型和小型企业，大搞化工的“小土群”或“小洋群”，就是继续大搞群众运动、充分发挥地方积极性，在全国范围内，开展一个群众性的大办化学工业的新高潮。
    一年多来的经验证明，只要彻底打破办化学工业的神秘观点，继续发扬敢想敢说敢做的风格，几乎所有化工产品都可以由“小土群”或“小洋群”来生产的，就是技术要求较高的合成氨工业和有机产品也不例外。例如硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、烧碱、纯碱、合成氨、磷肥、钾肥、糠醛、酒精、电石、合成橡胶、有机硅、环氧树脂、聚乙烯、苯乙烯等等，这样一些重要的化工产品，都可以由“小土群”或“小洋群”来生产。当然，我们提倡搞“小土群”，也并不是说越土越好，越小越好。有些产品适宜采用“小土群”的方法生产，有些产品（如合成氨）则适宜于搞“小洋群”；有些产品适宜于建小型厂，有些产品则适宜于建中型厂。总之要根据各种产品的不同情况，因地制宜，正确地贯彻执行大中小结合的方针。
    化学工业是一个最能综合利用各种物质资源的工业，化工“小土群”可以大大发挥这个特点。大搞“小土群”，可以充分利用当地农产品的资源和工业、农业的副产物，充分利用小型的分散的矿产资源，多方面地开辟原料来源。例如，利用砻糠生产糠醛，利用稻糠生产酒精、醋酸，利用糖厂的废糖蜜生产丙酮、丁醇，利用红薯生产葡萄糖、酒精，利用木材干馏生产醋石、醋酸、甲醇，利用蓖麻子油生产辛醇、癸二酸（尼纶的原料）等等。土硝的综合利用可以生产出六、七种化工产品。利用硫铁矿、芒硝、食盐等资源，可以生产多种化工产品。磷矿石、蛇纹石、钾长石、泥炭等矿产资源，在我国分布很广，可以广泛用来生产化肥。举办中、小型钙镁磷肥厂，可以同自办低温炼焦相结合，这样既取得半焦来供制造钙镁磷肥之用，又可以得到煤焦油和合成石油等产品。我国农副产品资源，越来越丰富，它的综合利用，不仅可以大大提高农产品的经济价值，同时可以大量地增加公社收入，促进公社的工业化。一年来，为了大搞“小土群”所进行的群众性调查，证明各省、市、自治区化工矿产资源是很丰富的。自然资源的无限丰富和分布很广，是普遍举办中型和小型化工厂的一个很有利的条件。
    化工“小土群”不是小有可为，而是大有可为。它绝不仅是为了增加现在迫切需要的化工产品的供应量（当然，这是很重要的），更重要的是，它为我国化学工业的发展开辟新的宽广的道路，大大加速我国化学工业的发展速度。去年大办“小土群”的经验证明，发动群众办化学工业，比工业部门少数人办化学工业不知快多少倍。巩固整顿后的“小土群”、“小洋群”已经成为我国化学工业重要组成部分。今天是“小土群”，毫无疑问，明天必将有大量的中小型甚至大型的近代化的化工企业。有了大量的“小土群”或“小洋群”，我们就有了培养人材的基地，就有了继续前进的阵地，依靠这个阵地，就可以大大加快化学工业的跃进步伐。我国化学工业的构成不仅在今天，而且在将来也必须既包含大型企业，又包含中、小型企业，必须是大、中、小相结合的完整体系。有了大量的中小型企业，就将使我国化学工业的分布逐步趋于合理，那时不仅沿海几个大城市有很多化工厂，而且在内地也将出现大量的化工厂；每个省、市、自治区不仅有一批骨干化工厂，同时还将有一批中、小型化工厂；不仅大城市有化工厂，中、小城市，专区、县和人民公社也将有规模不等的化工厂。这样才可以说是比较完全地实现了党中央和毛泽东同志所指示的全民办工业、全民办化学工业的方针。
    我们深信，坚持地贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，不仅使我们能够实现今年化学工业的大跃进，而且也使我们必然能够实现化学工业今后的继续大跃进。我们一定要争取时间，在今年做好“样板”，作好技术准备，大力培养技术力量，为明年大搞化工“小土群”创造必要的条件。我们相信明年的化工“小土群”运动一定能够更好地发展起来，从而使我国化学工业能够更好地更迅速地适应我国整个国民经济大跃进的要求。
    在这举国欢腾，热烈庆祝建国十周年的时候，我们化学工业战线上的全体职工，决心把目前已经形成的、声势浩大的群众运动坚持下去，决心千方百计，保证完成并超额完成今年的生产、建设计划，实现今年更大更全面的跃进，争取列入第二个五年计划的化工产品，在1960年全部完成八大一次大会所规定的1962年的指标。
