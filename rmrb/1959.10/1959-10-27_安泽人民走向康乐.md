The world proves that only the Communist Party can eradicate the disasters and suffering of the working people for generations to come. The people of Anze County, Shanxi Province, freed from the torment of disease, are widely spreading such verses praising the Communist Party:

For nearly a thousand years, many famous doctors appeared,
But the "Willow Cripple Disease" of Anze still flooded like a river.
Only ten years since the founding of New China, the source of the disease has dried up,
If you ask why, everyone praises the Communist Party.

Anze County has more than 88,000 people, and before liberation, 17,840 people suffered from Kashin-Beck disease (大骨节病) and goiter. "Willow Cripple Disease" mainly affected adult laborers. As the disease progressed, patients gradually changed from being fully capable to semi-capable, and then lost their ability to work, eventually leading to death.

According to a survey of 64 villages in Fan Zai Commune, 612 out of 990 people were ill. Being sick meant not being able to participate well in production. Calculating the county average, two out of ten people were unable to work, resulting in a loss of one million workdays per year. This disease has been prevalent in Anze for about a thousand years. Because the exploiting ruling classes of past dynasties did not care about the lives of the people, the disease became more prevalent and the torment more severe. Therefore, the local people were very afraid of it, saying: "Buy less jars, weave more baskets, carry everything away before you go." Many people were driven out of Anze by the disease and had to flee.

The Communist Party cares deeply about the people of Anze. As early as 1944, Comrade Liu Shaoqi noticed this matter when he passed through Anze County. Soon after Comrade Shaoqi rested in Mujiia Village, he saw a middle-aged farmer carrying a load of water up a winding mountain path on the opposite hillside. He walked very slowly, his legs bent inward, and it took a great deal of effort to take each step. Comrade Shaoqi's eyes were fixed on him. After a while, he finally climbed the hillside and walked into the courtyard. Comrade Shaoqi went to talk to him and asked kindly: "Old fellow, are you not feeling well? Is there something wrong with your legs?" The old fellow held out his hands for Comrade Shaoqi to see. The joints of all ten fingers were swollen like small radishes. He told Comrade Shaoqi painfully: "This disease is called Willow Cripple Disease. The joints will slowly swell up like this, making it difficult to work." Comrade Shaoqi asked again with concern: "Are there many people in the village suffering from this disease? Does it affect lifespan? How do you get this disease?" He replied: "I don't know how you get it. There are many people in this place who suffer from this disease! People have suffered from it for generations, and there is no way to cure it." Comrade Shaoqi said: "We must find the root cause of the disease." Comrade Shaoqi immediately followed the stream where the old fellow carried water and carefully observed it. He found that the leaves of elm and jujube trees on the hillside were blown into the stream by the wind. Some flowed away, and some had turned dark brown and emitted a moldy smell. Comrade Shaoqi said to the comrades who were with him: "Is it possible that the old fellow got this disease from drinking unclean water, that there are toxins or harmful minerals in the water, or that they are lacking certain nutrients…".

At that time, no one could answer. Comrade Shaoqi said to Bi Zhanyun, the Chief of Staff of the Taiyue Military Region Command: "Willow Cripple Disease is the pain of the masses for generations. We Communists must find a way to relieve the masses of this disaster." From then on, the local Party committee led the people to start the work of eradicating Willow Cripple Disease.

After the liberation of Anze, the County Party Committee and the County People's Government, following Comrade Shaoqi's instructions, clarified the causes of the disease. The main causes were unclean drinking water, lack of iodine and calcium in nutrition, and the presence of sickle bacteria parasitizing in the grain. They also investigated and clarified that there were more than 18,000 people in the county suffering from Willow Cripple Disease (more than 20% of the county's total population). Based on this situation, the County Party Committee determined the policy of "treating the symptoms and addressing the root causes" simultaneously. In terms of addressing the root causes, the County People's Congress made two resolutions, proposing the slogan and initiative of "digging wells, drinking rainwater, eating sea salt, and eating kelp" throughout the county. In order to support the people in overcoming "Willow Cripple Disease," the commercial departments supplied approximately 700,000 jin of sea salt and 30,000 jin of kelp each year. This approach had a significant effect on reducing the incidence of the disease and alleviating the suffering of patients. Since 1952, Songjia Ridge has dug 47 wells, and after the masses drank rainwater, only 24 out of 73 people in the village were ill, of whom 20 were old patients from 1951. Only four new cases of "Willow Cripple Disease" have occurred in the past seven years. The masses said: "The pain is reduced after drinking well water." However, it was still impossible to completely eliminate the disease. In terms of treating the symptoms, in addition to providing general training to medical personnel throughout the county to enhance their confidence in treating Willow Cripple Disease, during the Great Leap Forward last year, the County Party Committee proposed the battle cry of "controlling in one year and eliminating in two years." From top to bottom, a command headquarters for the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases was established, and a prevention and treatment army of nearly 1,000 people was organized throughout the county.

The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the CPC also strongly supported this work. The Provincial Party Committee successively drew 18 medical technicians with higher medical skills from the Provincial Health Department, Geological Department, Medical College, Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Anti-epidemic Station to form the Shanxi Provincial Resident Anze County Endemic Disease Prevention and Treatment Research Group, and allocated 100,000 yuan to help equip X-ray machines, refrigerators, and other instruments. The county implemented a system of assigning responsibility at all levels and having people responsible for each village. After half a year of hard work, according to the standards of complete disappearance of pain in patients, free movement of limbs, and flexion of curved limbs to 175 degrees, statistics to date show that 3,988 people with Kashin-Beck disease have been cured, 1,900 have been basically cured, and 1,550 have improved. The remaining patients are actively undergoing treatment. Medical personnel have all expressed that they must treat all patients well in the near future. More than 80% of those with goiter have been cured or improved, and those undergoing treatment account for more than 10% of the number of patients. In the treatment process, several effective drugs such as "Double Crow Pill" and effective treatments such as acupuncture and cupping were successfully created. After taking the medicine, most patients can be cured in half a month to twenty days. Due to the great success in eradicating diseases, production has been greatly promoted. This year's wheat harvest and the purchase and storage of 4.5 million jin of wheat were done faster and better than in any previous year. The Fifth Management District of Fucheng Commune is one of the areas most severely affected by Kashin-Beck disease. More than 40% of the 118 laborers in the entire management district are ill. Last year, only 35,800 workdays were completed throughout the year. After the disease was cured, 42,500 workdays were completed from January to August this year, and the whole year can be increased by more than double. Dong Changyi, a patient, completed 136 workdays from January to August this year after being cured, while he only completed 14 workdays in the whole year last year. This management district not only achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year, but also became the first advanced management district in the county. Director Old Ma happily said: "The Communist Party has real skills, curing the masses of Kashin-Beck disease and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production."

This year, Anze is experiencing a Great Leap Forward in production and a Great Leap Forward in eliminating pests and diseases, showing a good year of both prosperity and abundance everywhere. In this new life, everyone is radiant, smiling, and writing letters and telegrams to thank the Party and the People's Government. The entire village of Chuankou wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu after their recovery, saying: "In the past, we were in extreme pain, and we were often afraid of wolves eating us, thieves stealing us, falling into pits, and divorce. We never dreamed that we could become faster at work, faster at walking, and have a good relationship between husband and wife. We thank the Communist Party and always listen to Chairman's words. We will work hard in the commune and strive to be good pacesetters of red diligence and skill."

    安泽人民走向康乐
    梁明
    世上，只有共产党，才能为劳动人民根除世世代代的灾难和痛苦。摆脱了病魔折磨苦痛的山西安泽县人民，普遍流传着这样歌颂共产党的诗句：
    时间过了近千年，名医出现许许多，
    安泽的柳拐子病，还是洪水样泛滥。
    新中国成立才十年，疾病泉源就枯干，
    若问原因是何在，人人都赞共产党。
    安泽县有八万八千多人，解放前，就有一万七千八百四十人害着大骨节病和甲状腺肿病。“柳拐子病”患者多为成年的劳动者，患者随着病情的发展，逐渐由全劳动力变为半劳动力，再进而失掉劳动力，以致死亡。
    据范在公社六十四个村的调查，九百九十人中就有六百一十二人患病。得了病就不能好好参加生产，全县平均计算，十个人中就有两个人不能干活，全年算起来就要少做一百万个劳动日。这种病在安泽流布开来，大约有近千年的历史。由于历代剥削统治阶级不管人民死活，病越流行，折磨也越厉害，因此，当地群众对它也十分恐惧，都说：“少买缸，多编筐，临走一担担个光。”好些人就是被病魔驱逐，不得不逃出了安泽。
    共产党非常关心安泽人民。早在1944年，刘少奇同志一次路过安泽县时，就注意了这件事。少奇同志刚刚到木家村休息下来，看到了对面山坡下，一个中年农民担了一担水，沿着一条弯弯曲曲的山路，蹒跚地爬上来。他走得很慢，两条腿，向里弯着，几乎每跨上一步，都要费很大气力。少奇同志的目光一直注视着他。过了好一会儿，他终于爬上了山坡，走到院里来。少奇同志便去和他攀谈，并慈祥地问道：“老乡，你不舒服？你的腿有病吗？”老乡把双手伸出来给少奇同志看，十个手指的骨节都肿得像小萝卜一样。他痛苦地告诉少奇同志说：“这种病，叫柳拐子病，骨节慢慢地都会这样肿起来的，干活很困难”。少奇同志又关切地问：“村里害这样病的人多不多，它对寿命有没有影响？这种病怎么得的？”他回答说：“说不上是怎得的，这地方害这种病的人可多哩！祖祖辈辈都有人害，也没办法”。少奇同志说：“一定能找出得病的根源”。少奇同志立即沿着老乡担水的小溪，进行了仔细的观察，发现了山坡上的榆树、枣树的叶子随风刮落在溪水中，有的流走了，有的已变成黑褐色，散发着霉烂的气味。少奇同志对跟随他的同志们说：“老乡得了这种病，是不是喝了不干净的水，水里有什么毒素或有害的矿质。还是缺少什么营养……”。
    当时，谁也回答不出来。少奇同志对太岳军区司令部参谋长毕占云同志说：“柳拐子病是群众世世代代的痛苦，我们共产党人一定要设法给群众解除这种灾难。”从此，当地党委就领导人民开始了根治柳拐子病的工作。
    安泽解放以后，县委与县人民政府，执行少奇同志的指示，摸清了发病的原因，主要是由于饮水不洁，营养缺碘缺钙，以及粮食里寄生有镰刀菌等而发病；也调查清了全县害柳拐子病有一万八千多人（占全县总人口的20％以上）的情况。根据这种情况，县委确定了“治标和治本”双管齐下的方针。在治本方面，县人民代表大会曾两次作出决议，提出了全县“打旱井，吃雨水，吃海盐，吃海带”的口号和倡议。商业部门为了支援人民战胜“柳拐子病”，每年大约供应给海盐七十万斤，海带三万斤。这样做对降低发病率，减轻患者的痛苦，收到了显著的效果。宋家岭自1952年打旱井四十七眼，群众吃雨水后，全村七十三口人中，只有二十四个人患病，其中有二十人是1951年的老病人，七年来新发生“柳拐子病”的只有四个。群众说：“吃了旱井水，疼痛减轻了”。但是还不能彻底消灭发病。在治标方面，除了对全县的医务人员进行普训，增强他们治疗柳拐子病的信心外；在去年大跃进中，县委又提出：“一年控制、二年消灭”的战斗口号，自上而下地成立了防治地方病指挥部，全县组织起了一支近千人的防治大军。
    中共山西省委也大力支持了这个工作，省委先后从省卫生厅、地质厅、医学院、中医研究所、防疫站抽出十八名医学技术较高的人员，组成山西省驻安泽县地方病防治研究组，并拨出十万元的款项，帮助装备爱克斯光机、冰箱等仪器。全县实行了层层负责、村村有人包干的办法。经过半年的奋战，按照病人疼痛全部消失，四肢能自由活动，弯曲四肢能曲到一百七十五度的标准衡量，截至目前统计：大骨节病已痊愈者三千九百八十八人，基本痊愈者一千九百人，好转者一千五百五十人，其余患者，正在积极进行治疗。医务人员都表示一定要在最近全部把患者治疗好。甲状腺肿已痊愈或好转者在80％以上，正在治疗的占患病人数10％以上。在治疗过程中，成功地创造出了“双乌丸”等几种特效药和针灸、拔火罐等特效治疗法，患者服用后，在半月到二十天，大部可以痊愈。由于根治病害的工作获得很大成绩，大大促进了生产。今年的麦收和四百五十万斤小麦征购入库工作，都比过去任何一年做的又快又好。府城公社第五管理区，是一个患大骨节病最严重的地区，全管理区的一百一十八个劳动力中，就有40％以上的人患病，去年全年仅作劳动日三万五千八百个，在治好病后，今年1至8月就作了四万二千五百个劳动日，全年可以增加一倍多。患者董长义治好病后今年1至8月就做了一百三十六个劳动日，而去年全年只做了十四个劳动日。这个管理区，不仅今年小麦获得了特大丰收，并且成了全县的第一个先进管理区，主任老马喜欢地说：“共产党有真正的本事，治好了群众的大骨节病，推动了生产大跃进”。
    今年，安泽是生产大跃进，又是除害灭病大跃进，到处显示出人财两旺的好年景。在这新的生活里，人人精神焕发，喜笑颜开，并纷纷写信、拍电报，感谢党与人民政府。川口村全体患者，病愈后写给毛主席和刘主席的一封信说：“过去我们痛苦到极点，心里常常怕狼吃、怕贼偷、怕下坑、怕离婚，梦里也没想到还能变的干活快、走路快、夫妇感情好。我们感谢共产党，时时听主席的话，在公社里好好劳动，争取人人做个红勤巧的好标兵”。
