Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 22nd: The Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, which the people of the whole country have been eagerly anticipating, has been successfully completed and will soon be handed over to the state for acceptance inspection and put into production; during the construction period, it has already produced six hundred and thirty 54-horsepower "Dongfanghong" brand tractors.

    The completion of this factory is a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. After it is put into production, it will provide a large amount of agricultural machinery and equipment for the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country and support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture.

    The eleven main workshops of this large-scale tractor manufacturing plant, as well as the auxiliary, power, and service departments, have all been built long ago. After more than two years of equipment installation, production preparation, production adjustment, and trial production, it is now fully equipped to be handed over to the state for acceptance inspection and to be put into full production. Now, more than 20,000 employees of this factory are launching a warm socialist labor competition under the slogan "Everyone doing a good deed for the factory's acceptance inspection," and the entire factory is filled with joy, welcoming the arrival of the acceptance inspection date.

    Inside the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, more than 10,000 sets of various modern machine equipment are installed, and the entire production process is highly mechanized. All heavy transportation in the factory is also replaced by machinery. The factory has also built a complete power equipment system, including a gas station, an oxygen station, a compressed air station, and a power distribution station, as well as a complete warehouse and transportation system. The magnificent buildings constitute the newest and most beautiful picture, and are praised as "Tractor City".

    This beautiful "picture" of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant was painted at high speed by all the factory's construction workers under the brilliant light of the Party's general line. The workers who built this factory created many miracles here. After building the large workshop exterior of the engine workshop in thirty-eight working days, they built the large workshop exterior of the fuel workshop in thirty-two working days. In 1958, encouraged by the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, an even larger-scale construction upsurge immediately appeared. The amount of basic construction investment completed this year was equivalent to the total amount of basic construction investment completed in the three years before the factory was built. In order to strive for high speed, in the case of insufficient raw materials, materials, and various equipment, the factory adopted the methods of "self-reliance, arming oneself" and "building while producing," overcoming numerous difficulties. From last year to now, they have mobilized the masses to smelt more than 10,000 tons of steel and more than 4,900 tons of iron, and used these steels and the production potential of some of the machinery and equipment that has already been installed to manufacture more than 6,000 sets of various standard and non-standard machine equipment, more than 1.36 million pieces (sets) of various process equipment, and more than 3,740 electric motors. This not only accelerated the progress of factory construction, but also saved more than 50 million yuan in factory construction investment.

    Due to the large-scale mass movement and the implementation of the principle of building while producing, this factory broke the old rule of separating construction and production into two distinct stages when building large-scale enterprises in the past. This not only accelerated the construction progress, but also created favorable conditions for formal production. Before the entire completion, this factory began trial production of 54-horsepower "Dongfanghong" brand tractors in July last year; in mid-September this year, comprehensive assembly line trial production was carried out, producing 250 units in half a month, averaging one unit every fifteen minutes and twelve seconds, basically reaching the design level. Up to now, a total of 630 units have been produced, and the quality fully meets the product design standards. In addition, 534 sets of irrigation and drainage engines and more than 110 sets (units) of metallurgical equipment have been produced. At present, almost all provinces and autonomous regions in the country have used "Dongfanghong" brand tractors.

    The main workshop of the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant began construction on October 1, 1955. The construction of this factory received full assistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union manufactured many large, complex, special, and precise complete sets of machines and tools for this factory. The Soviet Union also helped train more than 150 technical backbones and sent 38 experts to provide specific guidance and assistance in the factory construction work. (International Picture)

### 一支强大的工业援军投入农业机械化的战斗  我国第一座拖拉机厂诞生  六百三十台东方红牌拖拉机陆续开赴各省区农村

    一支强大的工业援军投入农业机械化的战斗
    我国第一座拖拉机厂诞生
    六百三十台东方红牌拖拉机陆续开赴各省区农村
    据新华社洛阳22日电　全国人民殷切瞩望的洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂已经胜利建成，将在最近向国家交工验收，正在投入生产；建厂期间已经生产出六百三十台五十四匹马力的东方红牌拖拉机。
    这座工厂的建成，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是大跃进的胜利，也是中苏友谊的结晶。它投入生产以后，将为我国实现农业机械化提供大量的农业机械装备，支援农业大跃进。
    这座规模巨大的拖拉机制造厂的十一个主厂房，以及辅助、动力、服务等部门的工程，都早已建设好了。经过两年多来的设备安装、生产准备、调整生产和试生产等一系列的实践，已经具备了向国家交工验收全面投入生产的条件。现在，这个厂的两万多名职工，正在“为工厂交工验收每人作一件好事”的口号下，展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛，整个工厂喜气洋洋，迎接交工验收日期的来临。
    在第一拖拉机制造厂里，安装着一万多台各式各样的现代化机器设备，整个生产工艺过程是高度机械化的。全厂笨重的运输也全部由机械代替。这个厂还建设了煤气站、氧气站、压缩空气站、配电站等完整的动力设备系统，以及完善的仓库和运输系统。雄伟的建筑物，构成了一幅最新最美的图画，被人称赞为“拖拉机城”。
    第一拖拉机制造厂这幅美好的“图画”，是全体建厂职工在党的总路线的光辉照耀下高速度画成的。建设这个厂的工人曾经在这里创造了很多奇迹，他们以三十八个工作日建成了发动机工场的大型厂房外型以后，又以三十二个工作日建成了燃料工场的大型厂房外型。1958年，在全国工农业大跃进形势鼓舞下，又立即出现了更大规模的施工高潮。这一年完成的基本建设投资额，相当于建厂前三年完成的基本建设投资额的总和。为了争取高速度，在原料、材料以及各种设备不足的情况下，这个厂采用了“自力更生、自己武装自己”和“边建设、边生产”的办法，克服了重重困难。从去年到现在，他们发动群众炼出了一万多吨钢和四千九百多吨铁，并且利用这些钢铁和已经安装起来的部分机器设备的生产潜力，制造出各种标准的和非标准的机器设备六千多台，各种工艺装备一百三十六万多件（套），各种电动机三千七百四十部。这不仅加速了建厂进度，而且节约了建厂投资达五千多万元。
    这个厂由于大搞群众运动和贯彻执行了边生产边建设的方针，打破了以往建设大型企业时把建设和生产截然分成两个阶段的陈规，这不但加速了建设进度，还为正式投入生产创造了有利条件。在全部建成之前，这个厂在去年7月份就开始试生产五十四匹马力的东方红牌拖拉机；今年9月中旬进行全面流水试生产，半个月内生产出二百五十台，平均十五分十二秒生产一台，基本达到设计水平。到目前为止，共生产出六百三十台，质量完全达到产品设计标准。此外，还生产出排灌发动机五百三十四台，冶炼设备一百一十多套（台）。目前，几乎全国各省和自治区都使用了东方红牌拖拉机。
    洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂的主厂房是在1955年10月1日动工兴建的。这个工厂的建设得到苏联的全面援助。苏联为这个厂制造了许多大型的、复杂的、专用的、精密的成套机器和工具。苏联还帮助培训了一百五十多名技术骨干，并派来三十八位专家，具体指导和帮助建厂工作。（际图片）
