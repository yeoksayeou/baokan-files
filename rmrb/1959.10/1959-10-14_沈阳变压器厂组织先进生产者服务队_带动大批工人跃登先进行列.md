Shenyang Transformer Factory Organizes Advanced Producer Service Teams
Leads a Large Number of Workers to Jump into the Ranks of the Advanced
    Our newspaper Shenyang, October 13th (Reporter Zhao Chunlie) reports: The Shenyang Transformer Factory has extensively established advanced producer service teams, mobilizing advanced producers in a guided and organized way to actively assist workers who are temporarily lagging behind in production, promoting a new situation throughout the factory of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, the advanced helping the backward, the backward catching up with the advanced, and common advancement.
    Currently, sixteen advanced production service teams have been established in this factory. In addition to the thirteen workshops that have established such organizations, three departments have also recently been established.
    This new mass line method of relying on the vast number of advanced producers to promote a general surge in production began in June and July of this year. At that time, in order to further improve product quality, the factory analyzed quality problems and found that the low technical level of some young workers and their failure to comply with process regulations were important reasons hindering rapid quality improvement. Based on this situation, the factory leadership decided to first conduct a pilot project in the metalworking workshop, organizing advanced producers to help workers with poor quality improve their skills, implement process regulations, and pass on their experience of not producing defective products. With the help of the advanced producer service team, forty of the forty-two less productive workers in the metalworking workshop eliminated defective products in August, and average production efficiency increased by 20%. Eleven workers reached the level of advanced producers in the workshop. Due to the transformation of the backward workers, the overall production level of the workshop greatly improved. In August, the product qualification rate reached 99.97%, and the excellent product rate jumped from 60% in the past to 80%. Production efficiency increased by 26% compared to July.
    After the activities of the advanced producer service team in the metalworking workshop proved effective, the factory's Party and Youth League organizations immediately promoted it throughout the factory and expanded the service team's tasks to become the locomotive for helping the backward and improving production.
    The activities of the advanced producer service team are carried out in a planned and purposeful manner. They analyze the reasons for the backwardness of less productive workers in advance, and organize team members to provide assistance based on the shortcomings of the backward workers. In the two months since the factory launched the advanced producer service team activities, sixty-eight workers have jumped from backward to advanced production levels, two hundred and ninety-two workers have improved quality, and eight hundred and ten workers have increased efficiency by more than 10%, with the highest increase being seventy-five times. With the help of advanced producers, backward workers have achieved four hundred and sixty-seven technical innovations, more than twenty advanced experiences, and breakthroughs in seventy-nine key production areas. The advanced producer service team played a huge role in the early completion of the third quarter's tasks by the entire factory. (Attached picture)

　　沈阳变压器厂组织先进生产者服务队
    带动大批工人跃登先进行列
    本报沈阳13日电　记者赵春烈报道：沈阳变压器厂广泛建立先进生产者服务队，有领导有组织地动员先进生产者积极帮助在生产上暂时落后的工人，促使全厂出现了一个学先进、赶先进，先进帮助后进，后进赶上先进，共同跃进的新形势。
    目前在这个工厂里已经建立起十六个先进生产服务队，除了十三个车间个个都已建立了这种组织外，并且有三个科室也在最近成立起来。
    这种依靠广大先进生产者，促使生产普遍高涨的新的群众路线方法是在今年6、7月份开始的。当时，这个厂为了进一步提高产品质量，在分析质量问题时，发现部分青年工人技术水平低，有的不遵守工艺规程，这是阻碍质量迅速提高的重要原因。根据这一情况，工厂领导便决定先在金工车间试点，把先进生产者组织起来，分别帮助质量较差的工人提高技术，贯彻工艺规程，并且把自己不出废品的经验传授给他们。在先进生产者服务队的帮助下，金工车间四十二名生产较落后的工人在8月份有四十人消灭了废品，平均生产效率提高20％，有十一名工人达到了车间先进生产者水平。由于落后工人的转变，整个车间生产水平大大提高，8月份产品合格率达到了99.97％，优良品由过去的60％一跃而达到80％，生产效率比7月份提高26％。
    先进生产者服务队在金工车间的活动收到效果后，厂里的党、团组织就立即在全厂推广开来；并扩大了服务队的任务，成为帮助落后，提高生产的火车头。
    先进生产者服务队的活动是有计划有目的进行的，他们事先分析生产落后工人产生落后的原因，针对落后工人的短处组织队员去进行帮助。这个厂在开展先进生产者服务队活动的两个多月中，已经有六十八名工人由落后跃进到先进生产水平，有二百九十二名工人提高质量，有八百一十名工人提高效率10％以上，最高提高七十五倍。后进工人在先进生产者帮助下实现了四百六十七项技术革新，二十多种先进经验，突破七十九项生产关键。全厂在提前完成第三季度任务中，先进生产者服务队起了巨大作用。（附图片）
