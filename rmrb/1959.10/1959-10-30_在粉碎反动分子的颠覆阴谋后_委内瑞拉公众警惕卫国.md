Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Following the suppression of the reactionary elements' conspiracy to overthrow the current government, the Venezuelan government and patriotic people are taking further measures to suppress the reactionary elements and defend the republic.

The reactionary elements' conspiracy was launched by those loyal to the overthrown Jiménez dictatorship and the Dominican dictator. In early October, in Caracas, Maracaibo, and other cities, a large number of conspirators placed a large number of grenades and landmines near gas stations, shops, schools, cinemas, radio stations, and the residences of politicians and journalists, carrying out explosions in an attempt to create chaos. At the same time, prisoners in the Maracaibo state prison created riots and seized police guns. However, all these conspiracies were promptly suppressed by the Venezuelan government. As the government strengthened security measures, many former Jiménez officials and secret police officers involved in the conspiracy were arrested, including millionaire Holfreedo Abilahoud and an American Creole Oil Company lawyer. Thousands of soldiers and police are also patrolling day and night. After the conspiracy was suppressed, Venezuelan political parties, trade unions, professionals, and student groups issued statements condemning the terrorist activities of the reactionary elements, mobilizing all members to stop any conspiracy to launch a coup to overthrow the current government.

While Venezuela is suppressing the terrorist activities of foreign-orchestrated conspirators, the Venezuelan government's presidential envoy and foreign minister also stated during visits to Argentina and Cuba that Venezuela is willing to cooperate with Latin American countries to jointly oppose foreign aggression and defend its own economic interests. According to Argentina's "La Prensa" newspaper, Jovito Villalba, the Venezuelan presidential envoy and member of parliament from the ruling Republican Democratic Union, said at a press conference on the 20th that Latin American countries must cooperate in defending their economic interests. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ignacio Luis Arcaya, who recently visited Cuba, also expressed full support for Cuba's opposition to the Dominican dictator Trujillo's aggression at a press conference in Havana. When talking about the United States' plan to establish a Pan-American police force to suppress revolutions, Arcaya said, "We oppose all international police systems." When talking about Venezuela's oil, Arcaya said, "There is currently a basis for establishing a national company and exploiting existing oil reserves," and said that oil concessions to various countries will not be extended after their expiration.

    在粉碎反动分子的颠覆阴谋后
    委内瑞拉公众警惕卫国
    本报综合报道　委内瑞拉在镇压了反动分子企图推翻现政权的阴谋之后，委内瑞拉政府和爱国人民正在进一步采取措施对反动分子进行镇压，保卫共和国。
    这次反动分子的阴谋是由效忠于已被打倒的希门尼斯独裁政权的人和多米尼加独裁分子发动的。10月初在加拉加斯、马腊凯和其他城市，大批阴谋分子把大量手榴弹和地雷安放在汽油站、商店、学校、电影院、广播电台和政治家和记者的住所附近，进行爆炸，企图造成混乱。而同时马拉开波的国家监狱里的囚犯也制造骚动，夺走警察枪支。但是这一切阴谋都被委内瑞拉政府及时镇压了。随着政府加强了保卫措施，逮捕了许多与这次阴谋有关的前希门尼斯的官员和秘密警察，其中包括百万富翁何尔弗雷多·阿比拉胡德和美国克里奥尔石油公司的律师。数千名军队和警察也日夜进行巡逻。阴谋被镇压之后，委内瑞拉的各政党、工会组织、自由职业者和学生团体纷纷发表声明，谴责反动分子的恐怖活动，动员全体成员起来制止任何发动政变企图推翻现政府的阴谋活动。
    在委内瑞拉镇压由外国策划的阴谋分子的恐怖活动的同时，委内瑞拉政府总统特使和外长也在访问阿根廷、古巴时表示委内瑞拉愿意和拉丁美洲各国合作来共同反对外国侵略和保卫本国经济利益。据阿根廷“新闻报”报道，委内瑞拉总统特使、执政党的共和民主联盟议员霍维托·比利亚耳瓦在20日的记者招待会上曾说，拉丁美洲国家必须在保卫它们的经济利益方面进行合作。最近在古巴访问的委内瑞拉外长伊格纳西奥·路易斯·阿卡亚，也在哈瓦那的一次记者招待会上表示全力支持古巴反对多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略的侵略。在谈到美国关于成立泛美警察部队以镇压革命计划时，阿卡亚说，“我们反对一切国际警察体系”。阿卡亚在谈到委内瑞拉的石油时说，“目前有基础建立国家公司并开采现有的油藏”，并且说，对各国的石油租让期满后将不再延长。
