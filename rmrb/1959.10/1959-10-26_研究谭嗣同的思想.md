    Research on Tan Sitong's Thought

    The Japanese "Taian" monthly magazine published in July 1959 an article by the Japanese "China Culture Association" entitled "Research on Tan Sitong." This article listed various evaluations of Tan Sitong's political and academic thought by Chinese academic circles since the late Qing Dynasty, and also introduced the research situation of Japanese academic circles on Tan Sitong's political and academic thought.

    According to the introduction of this article, the works of Japanese academic circles on Tan Sitong's thought include Kojima Yuma's "Tan Sitong's Renxue" and "China's Revolutionary Thought." Yoshikawa Katsuji, in his book "The Structure of Tan Sitong's Renxue," believes that it is necessary to grasp the "Ren" as the essence of "Renxue" and the revolutionary thought developed from it. Ishizato Toshiyoshi, in "Preliminary Remarks on Tan Sitong's Renxue—Tan Sitong's Experience as a Prerequisite for Renxue Works," regards "Renxue" as a work "sufficient to express the characteristics of the modernization process of Chinese thought." Japanese academic works on Tan Sitong's thought also include Sakashita Isao's "The Meaning of Ren in Tan Sitong's Thought" and Onogawa Hideki's "Tan Sitong's Reform Theory." In addition, Shimada Kenji, in his article "On Subjective Idealism in Modern China—The Thought of Ren as the Oneness of All Things," believes that Tan Sitong's thought "belongs to the system of subjective idealism." Nomura Koichi, in his article "The Formation of the Gongyang School in the Late Qing Dynasty and the Historical Significance of Kang Youwei's Doctrine," believes that "Renxue" is the concretization of the thought of the "Datong Shu." He also believes that "in order to be applicable to the then current situation in China, it faced the modern West, striving to open up a comprehensive path of reform while tracing back to the ancient past, and thus became a theory of national revolution."

    研究谭嗣同的思想
    日本“大安”月刊1959年7月号，发表了日本“中国文化协会”的“关于谭嗣同的研究”一文。这篇文章罗列了清末以来我国学术界对谭嗣同政治学术思想的各种评价，并且介绍了日本学术界对谭嗣同政治学术思想的研究情况。
    据这篇文章的介绍，日本学术界研究谭嗣同思想的著作有小岛佑马的“谭嗣同的仁学”和“中国的革命思想”。吉川胜治在“谭嗣同的仁学构造”一书中，认为必须把握住作为“仁学”之本质的“仁”和由它发展而成的革命思想。石里俊义在“关于谭嗣同的仁学序说——作为仁学著作前提的谭嗣同的经历”中，把“仁学”看作是“足以表现中国思想近代化过程中的特点”的著作。日本学术界研究谭嗣同思想的著作还有拆下功的“谭嗣同思想中的仁的含义”和小野川秀美的“谭嗣同的变革论”。此外，岛田虔次在“关于近世中国的主观唯心论——万物一体的仁的思想”一文中，认为谭嗣同的思想是“属于主观唯心论体系”的。野村浩一在“清末公羊学派的形成和康有为学说的历史意义”一文中，认为“仁学”是“大同书”思想的具体化。他还认为，“为了适用于当时中国的现状，它面对着近代的西方，在追溯往古之中去努力开拓全面的革新道路，并进而成为一种民族革命的理论。”
