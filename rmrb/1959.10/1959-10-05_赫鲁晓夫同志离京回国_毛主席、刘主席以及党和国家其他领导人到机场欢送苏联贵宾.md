Xinhua News Agency, October 4th: Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, leading the Soviet Party and Government delegation, departed Beijing by plane this morning to return home. Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and other Party and state leaders, including Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Biao, were at the airport to see them off.

Comrade Khrushchev delivered a farewell speech at the airport. He said: "Dear Comrade Mao Zedong! Dear Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai! Dear comrades and friends!

The Soviet Party and Government delegation is about to leave Beijing. At your invitation, we participated in the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China here. During our stay in Beijing, we held cordial and friendly meetings and talks with Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

On behalf of the delegation and in my own name, I thank the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the friendly and warm reception given to us.

Your festival convincingly demonstrates the achievements of the Chinese people in building socialism and their unity around the Chinese Communist Party.

 The Soviet people regard the Chinese people as their brothers, friends, and allies. The friendship between our peoples has been consolidated in the common struggle for the victory of socialism and for world peace. The Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will continue to make every necessary effort to further strengthen this friendship and strengthen the unity and solidarity of the entire socialist camp. The friendship between the Soviet Union and China is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and the entire socialist camp, and in the interests of world peace. The unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of our two great countries and the people of all countries in the socialist camp is an indestructible bulwark of peace and security for all countries and a guarantee of the future victory of socialism and communism.

Now, the forces of peace are unprecedentedly strong. There is now a real possibility to block the road to war. Ordinary people all over the world are increasingly convinced that, with the growth of the power of the world socialist system, it will be possible to permanently eliminate war as a tool for resolving international disputes. Therefore, we Soviet Communists consider it our sacred duty and primary task to use these favorable conditions and use everything possible to eliminate the 'Cold War' and ensure the victory of the cause of world peace.

We firmly believe that the reason of all peoples and their firm will to safeguard peace will surely triumph.

As I leave your glorious capital, Beijing, I wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Chinese people new victories in socialist construction and the struggle for peace.

Dear comrades and friends, goodbye!"

Comrade Khrushchev's speech, full of friendly passion, was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

Also present at the airport to see them off today were members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Lin Boqu, Peng Zhen, Luo Ronghuan, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Tan Zhenlin, alternate members of the Political Bureau Lu Dingyi, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Wang Jiaxiang, Tan Zheng, Li Xuefeng, alternate secretaries of the Secretariat Liu Lantao, Yang Shangkun, Hu Qiaomu, vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaltsen, Lin Feng, Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Bao Erhan, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, as well as heads of various departments of state organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, and Beijing, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in China.

    赫鲁晓夫同志在机场上发表了告别演说。他说：“亲爱的毛泽东同志！亲爱的刘少奇、朱德和周恩来同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    苏联党政代表团即将离开北京市，应你们的邀请，我们在这里参加了中华人民共和国十周年的庆祝典礼。来到北京这段时期中，我们同毛泽东、刘少奇、朱德、周恩来同志和中国共产党其他领导人举行了亲切友好的会见和座谈。
    我以代表团的名义和我个人的名义感谢中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府所给予我们的友好的殷勤接待。
    你们的节日令人信服地显示了中国人民在建设社会主义中所取得的成就和他们团结在中国共产党的周围。
    苏联人民把中国人民看成是自己的弟兄、朋友和盟国。我们两国人民的友谊在争取社会主义胜利、争取世界和平的共同斗争中得到了巩固。苏联人民和苏联共产党今后仍将尽一切必要的努力进一步加强这种友谊，加强整个社会主义阵营的统一和团结。苏中两国的友谊符合我们两国和整个社会主义阵营的根本利益，符合世界和平事业。我们两个伟大国家的人民，整个社会主义阵营各国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊是各国人民和平与安全不可摧毁的堡垒，是社会主义、共产主义未来胜利的保证。
    现在，和平力量空前强大。现在完全存在着现实的可能性来堵塞战争的道路。全世界普通的人日益相信，随着世界社会主义体系威力的增长，将能够永远地排除把战争作为解决国际争端的工具。因此，我们苏联共产党人认为自己的神圣职责和首要任务是利用这些有利的条件，利用一切可能来消除‘冷战’，保证世界和平事业胜利。
    我们深深相信，各国人民的理智，他们维护和平的坚定意志必将胜利。
    当我离开贵国光荣的首都——北京市时，我衷心地预祝兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设和争取和平的斗争中取得新的胜利。
