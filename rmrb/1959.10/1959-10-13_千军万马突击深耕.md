To Make the Land Contribute More Potential to the Great Leap Forward

　　A Massive Force Plunges into Intensive Farming

　　More than 330 million mu of land have already been deeply plowed to a depth of six inches to one foot

    Fully Leveraging the Superiority of People's Communes by Rationally Organizing Manpower and Animal Power

    Vigorously Launching a Tool Reform Movement to Accelerate Speed and Ensure the Quality of Deep Plowing

    Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, rural areas across the country are seizing the current excellent situation, fully leveraging the superiority of the people's communes, and launching a large-scale and vigorous mass movement for deep plowing and deep tilling. At the same time, they are determined to set off a high tide of soil improvement this winter and next spring to lay a good foundation for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year and in the future.

    The nationwide plowing work has already achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of October 8th, eighteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, including Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Beijing, had already plowed more than 330.1 million mu of land, with most of the depth ranging from six to eight inches, and some reaching one foot.

    The extraordinary bumper harvest of crops last year and the large bumper harvest of crops this year have fully proven the enormous effect of deep plowing on increasing production. Before deep plowing this year, all localities extensively mobilized the masses to summarize the role and experience of deep plowing and deep tilling, forcefully refuting the erroneous arguments of some people who believed that deep plowing and deep tilling could not increase production, further stimulating the enthusiasm of the broad masses for deep plowing and deep tilling. Therefore, the area prepared for deep plowing and deep tilling in various localities this year has expanded compared to last year. Provinces and cities in North China are determined to sow all the wheat planted this year on land that has been deeply plowed and tilled. Various localities are also determined to achieve universal plowing and eliminate the phenomenon of sowing on unplowed stubble. In addition to planning to plant all 65 million mu of winter wheat planted this year on deeply tilled land, Shandong Province also plans to deeply till 61 million mu of winter fallow land, striving to ensure that the crops harvested next year will all grow in deeply tilled soil. Henan Province is determined to universally deeply plow all cultivated land in the province from now until next spring.

    All localities adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements in deep plowing. Currently, many counties and people's communes in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Ningxia provinces and regions are carrying out heated deep plowing competitions. The labor enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and members is unprecedentedly high. They are working in shifts day and night to rush to plow, competing to see who can plow faster and better, and who can cooperate better, all striving to be the best. People's communes in Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, have established more than 2,600 farm-busy canteens in the fields, set up more than 3,400 tents, and cadres and members are eating and living in the fields, rushing to plow and plant. People's communes in Bengbu Prefecture, Anhui Province, organized a 1.3 million-strong labor force, rushing to plow and plant day and night, basically achieving the goal of harvesting and plowing each piece of late autumn crop land. Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, organized inter-commune, inter-team, and inter-member competitions. The entire area had more than 1.4 million laborers, more than 400,000 draft animals, and more than 500 tractors invested in the battle of deep plowing. People's communes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have launched a socialist competition movement to learn from and catch up with advanced units in plowing. The Xiguo People's Commune in Meng County, Henan, established a deep plowing command, with each brigade setting up a sub-command, led by the Party Secretary, to direct the deep plowing work of all the brigades in the commune. They held plowing oath-taking rallies in the fields, and implemented ten "to the field" measures, including canteens, medical care, offices, tool repair, airing views and debating, and evaluation and competition. In ten days, they plowed all the dry land. Due to the vigorous mass movement, the progress of plowing work is fast and the quality is good. The area of land that has already been plowed nationwide has increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. In Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and other twelve provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, 73% of the land that has already been deeply plowed has reached a depth of six to eight inches or more.

    All localities are fully leveraging the superiority of the people's communes, rationally organizing labor and animal power in the deep plowing movement, and also engaging in large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equal exchange, supporting each other. People's communes in Shandong and Henan provinces have organized more than 32 million laborers and 2.7 million yoked draft animals, investing them in the three autumn tasks. Jiangsu Province organized 30% of the main labor force and 80% of the animal power to invest in the autumn plowing movement. Specialized teams for autumn plowing and leveling land have also been universally established throughout the province. Implementing fine plowing and careful harrowing according to local conditions, general leisure fields and early autumn stubble fields have all been plowed and harrowed two to three times. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, mobilized more than 80% of young people to invest in the deep plowing movement, organizing them into shock teams and combat groups, becoming the most active shock force in the deep plowing movement. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region divided leadership and labor into two fronts, rushing to harvest on one side and plowing on the other, speeding up progress and ensuring quality. People's communes in Qinghai Province carried out large-scale mountain-river cooperation based on the principle of equal exchange, accelerating the autumn plowing progress. All localities also implemented a responsibility system that specified the field, the person, the time, the quality, and the remuneration, and some places also implemented an inspection and acceptance system, thus ensuring progress and quality.

    Vigorously grasping the tool reform work, actively reforming and promoting the use of reformed tools is also an important measure to accelerate plowing speed and improve quality. Tongren County, Guizhou Province, promoted more than 10,000 new-style farm implements such as double-wheel double-furrow plows and wheel-less single-furrow plows, greatly accelerating the deep plowing progress, and the depth is generally above seven inches. Iron and wood workers in Tancheng County, Shandong Province, used old plow bodies and replaced them with improved plowshares and moldboards, making a narrow-width deep plowing plow that could plow four inches deeper than the old-style plow.

    While vigorously carrying out deep plowing, all localities are actively preparing to welcome the high tide of soil improvement this winter and next spring. All provinces and regions plan to universally improve the low-yielding land in their areas in the next two to three years. Henan Province plans to improve 12 million mu this winter and next spring, and Hebei also plans to improve more than 10 million mu this winter and next spring. Chengde Prefecture, Hebei Province, has transferred 30% of the labor force to vigorously build level terraces, and has built more than 1 million mu of level terraces in one month. Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan are actively preparing to hold soil improvement conferences to deploy the battle of soil improvement.

　　要大地为大跃进献出更多潜力
　　千军万马突击深耕
　　三亿三千多万亩地已经深翻六寸到一尺
    充分发挥人民公社优越性合理组织了人力畜力
    大抓工具改革运动加快了速度保证了深翻质量
    据新华社12日讯　在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，全国各地农村抓住当前的大好形势，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展了一个大规模的轰轰烈烈的深耕深翻地群众运动，同时决心在今冬明春掀起一个土壤改良高潮，为明年和今后农业更大的跃进打好基础。
    全国的耕翻工作已经取得很大的成绩。据农业部不完全的统计，到10月8日止，山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林、湖北、江苏、安徽、四川、贵州和北京等十八个省、自治区、市，已经耕翻了三亿三千一百多万亩地，深度大部分在六寸到八寸，部分达到一尺。
    去年农作物的特大丰收和今年农作物的大丰收，都充分证明了深耕深翻对增产的巨大作用。各地今年在深耕深翻之前，都广泛地发动群众总结了深耕深翻的作用和经验，有力地驳斥了一部分人认为深耕深翻不能增产等的错误论调，更加激发了广大群众深耕深翻的积极性，因而今年各地准备深耕深翻的面积都比去年扩大。华北各省市都决心把今年播种的小麦全部种在深耕和深翻过的土地上。各地还决心做到普遍耕翻，消灭板茬下种的现象。山东省除了计划把今年种植的六千五百万亩冬小麦全部种在深翻过的地上以外，还计划深耕冬闲田六千一百万亩，争取明年收获的农作物都生长在深翻过的土壤上。河南省决心从现在起到明春把全省的耕地普遍深耕一遍。
    各地在深耕深翻地中，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。目前，山东、河南、安徽、河北、山西、陕西、江苏、湖北和宁夏等省区，有许多县和人民公社都开展了热火朝天的深耕深翻地竞赛，广大干部和社员劳动热情空前高涨，他们日夜轮班突击耕翻，比谁耕翻的又快又好，比谁协作得好，齐争上游。山东省聊城专区各人民公社，在田间建立了二千六百多个农忙食堂，搭起三千四百多个帐篷，干部和社员吃住在田间，突击抢耕抢种。安徽省蚌埠专区各人民公社组织一百三十万劳动大军，日夜突击抢耕抢种，基本做到了晚秋作物收一块、耕一块。河北省邯郸专区组织了社与社、队与队、社员与社员的对手赛，全区有一百四十多万劳动力，四十多万头耕畜，五百多台拖拉机投入了深耕深翻地的战斗。宁夏回族自治区各人民公社掀起了学先进、赶先进的耕翻地社会主义竞赛运动。河南孟县西虢人民公社成立深翻地指挥部，各大队设立分指挥部，由党委书记挂帅，指挥全社各大队的深翻地工作，他们在田间召开翻地誓师大会，实行食堂、医疗、办公、工具修理、鸣放辩论、评比竞赛等十到田，在十天时间内，就把全部旱地翻完了。由于大搞群众运动，耕翻地的工作进度快，质量好。全国已经耕翻的土地面积比去年同期增加一倍多。河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西、江苏等十二个省、市、自治区，已经深耕深翻的土地中，有73％深度达到了六寸到八寸以上。
    各地充分发挥人民公社的优越性，在深耕深翻运动中合理地组织劳力、畜力，还本着等价交换的原则展开大协作，互相支援。山东、河南两省各地人民公社共组织三千二百多万劳动大军，二百七十万犋耕畜，投入了三秋工作。江苏省组织30％的主要劳动力和80％的畜力投入了秋耕运动，全省各地还普遍成立秋耕平整土地的专业队，因地制宜实行精耕细耙，一般休闲田和早秋茬都做到了犁耙两遍到三遍。湖北省襄阳专区各级共青团组织发动80％以上的青少年投入深翻地运动，把他们组织成突击队和战斗小组，成为深翻地运动中一支最活跃的突击力量。内蒙古自治区把领导力量和劳动力划分两条战线，一边抢收，一边耕翻，加快了进度，保证了质量。青海省各地人民公社根据等价交换原则，展开山川大协作，加快了秋翻进度。各地还实行了定田、定人、定时间、定质量、定报酬等的责任制，有的地方还推行了检查验收制度，因而保证了进度和质量。
    大抓工具改革工作，积极改制和推广使用改革的工具，也是加快耕翻速度，提高质量的一个重要措施。贵州省铜仁县推广一万多部双轮双铧犁、无轮一铧犁等新式农具，大大加快了深耕进度，而且深度一般都在七寸以上。山东省郯城县铁木工人利用旧犁身，换上一副改良犁头和犁镜，制成一种窄幅深耕犁，可以比旧式犁深耕四寸。
    各地在大闹深耕深翻地的同时，积极准备迎接今冬明春改良土壤的高潮。各省区都计划在今后两三年内普遍改良本地区的低产土地。河南省计划在今冬明春改良一千二百万亩，河北也计划今冬明春改良一千多万亩。河北承德专区已抽调30％的劳动力大搞水平梯田，在一个月内已修水平梯田一百多万亩。广东、山东、河南在积极准备召开土壤改良会议，布置改良土壤的战斗。
