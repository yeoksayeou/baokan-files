    Newly Compiled "Dai Kan-Wa Jiten"
    The "Dai Kan-Wa Jiten" (Chinese-Japanese Dictionary), compiled by Japanese scholar Dr. Tetsuji Morohashi, has released eight volumes from 1955 to the present. The remaining volumes, from the ninth to the twelfth, and the "Index," are scheduled to be completed this year.
    This is a large dictionary, containing approximately 50,000 Chinese characters. In addition to standard characters, it includes simplified characters, variant characters, and "kokuji" (Chinese characters created by the Japanese). The vocabulary included mainly consists of common idioms, historical allusions, proverbs, colloquialisms, poetic phrases, as well as personal names, place names, book titles, official titles, era names, and names of animals and plants. It also includes some common terms from law, economics, and other social sciences, as well as vocabulary commonly found in modern Chinese writing. In addition, it encompasses some Buddhist terms and Japanese vocabulary. The sources for the above vocabulary are primarily all ancient Chinese books, including the classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections, and it also references many dictionaries, including the "Gujin Tushu Jicheng," "Ciyuan," and "Cihai." At the same time, it has selected some new vocabulary from recently published newspapers and magazines.
    This is a reference book that blends ancient and modern, Chinese and Japanese, and has the nature of both a "dictionary" and an "encyclopedia." It provides Japanese Sinologists with a comprehensive and detailed tool, and it is also worthy of attention by scholars in our country.

    新编“大汉和辞典”
    日本诸桥辙博士编的“大汉和辞典”（汉日对照），从1955年至今，已出了八卷，剩下的第九卷至第十二卷和“索引”将于今年完成。
    这是一部大型的辞典，共收汉字约五万左右。所收汉字除正体字外，还有简体字、俗体字以及“国字”（日本人创造的汉字）。所收语汇以普通的成语、故事熟语、格言俚语、诗文成句以及人名、地名、书名、官职名、年号、动植物名为主，并收录了一部分常见的法律、经济等社会科学术语以及现代汉语中常见于书面的词汇，此外还包括了部分佛教用语和日语词汇在内。上述语汇的资料来源，是以包括经史子集的全部中国古籍为中心，又参考了包括“古今图书集成”“辞源”“辞海”等在内的许多辞书，同时，又从近年出版的报章杂志中选择了一些新语汇。
    这是一部杂揉古今中日，兼有“词典”和“事典”性质的参考书，它为日本的汉学研究者提供了一部既全面而又详细的工具书，同时也值得引起我国学者的注意。
