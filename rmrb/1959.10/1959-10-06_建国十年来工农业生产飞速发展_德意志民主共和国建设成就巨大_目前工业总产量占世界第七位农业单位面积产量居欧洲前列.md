Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The German Democratic Republic has achieved rapid development in industrial and agricultural production in the ten years since its founding.

Now, the German Democratic Republic stands tall in the world with a considerably influential industrial presence. Its total industrial output ranks fifth in Europe and seventh in the world. The absolute output of lignite ranks first in the world; the output of the chemical industry and power generation per capita rank second and fifth in the world respectively; and the absolute output of uranium ranks first in Europe. The proportion of its modern industry (excluding construction, handicrafts, etc.) in the total social output value has increased from 55.9% in 1950 to 64.8% in 1958.

In the past ten years, the German Democratic Republic has far exceeded capitalist countries in terms of industrial production growth rate. From 1950 to 1958, the average annual growth rate of industrial production in the German Democratic Republic was 13%, while the United States was only 3.7%, the United Kingdom was 2.9%, and France was 7.2%. This year, the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 2.5 times compared with 1949, while West Germany only increased by 1.1 times from 1950 to 1958.

As everyone knows, the industry of the old Germany was very developed. However, the Second World War, provoked by the Hitler fascists, caused serious damage to the industry in eastern Germany. In 1946, after the war, the industrial production level was only equal to 42% of the pre-war 1936 level. However, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, the heroic working class rapidly restored industrial production. Through the implementation of the two-year plan (1949-1950), industrial production reached and slightly exceeded the pre-war level by 1950.

Another significant change in the industry of the German Democratic Republic is the gradual elimination of the unbalanced development of various industrial sectors and the active efforts to establish a new industrial system. Before the war, highly industrialized Germany had a unified industrial system. After the war, this system was destroyed due to the division of Germany. According to statistics, in 1936, the industrial output value of eastern Germany was only equal to 33% of the total of Germany, and heavy industry was very underdeveloped. In terms of industrial distribution, the relatively developed areas in the eastern region were mainly processing industry, lignite mining, textile industry, optical and precision instrument manufacturing, and some departments of the chemical industry; as for industrial raw materials, they were extremely scarce. In response to this situation, the Party and the government adopted a policy of focusing on the development of the metallurgical industry and the machinery industry during the implementation of the first five-year plan (1951-1955); in the second five-year plan (1956-1960), the task of prioritizing the development of basic raw material industries (coal mining, electricity, and chemical industry) was put forward. In the past ten years, these heavy industrial sectors, which serve as the foundation of industry, have developed particularly rapidly. Among them, the machinery industry has developed the fastest, and the production of machinery manufacturing is now three times higher than in 1949.

Under the conditions of socialist countries' mutual assistance and cooperation, after ten years of hard work, heavy industry in the German Democratic Republic accounted for 60.4% of the total industrial output value in 1958, light industry accounted for 24%, and the food industry accounted for 15.6%, basically establishing a coordinated relationship among industrial sectors. Now, the industry of the German Democratic Republic has a high level of technology and possesses a strong workforce accounting for more than 80% of the country's employed population. This is a change of great significance.

While developing industry at a high speed, agricultural production has also made significant achievements.

In the past ten years, with the progress of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and due to the adoption of a series of technical measures to increase production, the yield per unit area of crops in the German Democratic Republic has rapidly increased. After the end of the war, after several years of arduous restoration work, the yield per unit area of crops nationwide had reached or approached pre-war levels by 1951. In 1950, the yield of grain per hectare was 2,070 kilograms, and now it has reached 2,520 kilograms, an increase of more than 20%. As early as 1957, the yield per unit area of ​​corn ranked third in Europe (excluding the Soviet Union), and various wheat varieties ranked fifth. Last year, the German Socialist Unity Party put forward the fighting slogan of achieving complete self-sufficiency in food for residents by 1962, which played a great role in encouraging and promoting the further upsurge of agricultural production.

In the total agricultural output value of the German Democratic Republic over the years, livestock production accounts for more than two-thirds, and farmers' income is also mainly based on livestock production. Therefore, developing the production of this sector has particularly important significance in agriculture. After the war, the total number of livestock continued to grow. In 1938, there were more than 3.6 million cattle, 5.7 million pigs, and more than 1.7 million sheep in the eastern region of Germany. By 1951, the number of livestock had exceeded this level. In the first half of this year, the total number of various livestock raised nationwide has greatly exceeded the annual number of the same type of livestock in 1938, with cattle reaching 4.4 million, pigs reaching more than 7.8 million, and sheep reaching more than 2 million. Now, the number of pigs ranks fourth in Europe, and if calculated on a per capita basis, it has exceeded West Germany.

Implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture is a basic policy of the German Democratic Republic for developing agricultural production. Since the large-scale launch of agricultural collectivization in 1952, the collectivization movement has made great progress. Up to now, there are 9,600 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, and their cultivated land area accounts for 40.9% of the total cultivated land area nationwide; together with 700 state-owned farms, almost 50% of the cultivated land nationwide belongs to the socialist sector.

Agricultural mechanization is one of the decisive steps in developing agricultural production. Now, there are 600 tractor stations across the country. At present, the cultivated land served by tractor stations accounts for 75% of the country's cultivated land, and in the cultivated land served by tractor stations, 75% of the area is plowed by machines, and the degree of mechanization of sowing and harvesting general grains reaches 37%.

    建国十年来工农业生产飞速发展
    德意志民主共和国建设成就巨大
    目前工业总产量占世界第七位农业单位面积产量居欧洲前列
    据新华社柏林4日电　德意志民主共和国建国十年来，工农业生产获得迅速的发展。
    现在，德意志民主共和国已以一个具有相当影响的工业的面貌屹立于世界。它的工业总产量在欧洲占第五位，在世界占第七位。褐煤绝对产量占世界第一位；化学工业产量和电力产量按人口平均计算分别居于世界第二位和第五位；铀的绝对产量居欧洲第一位。它的现代工业（不包括建筑业、手工业等部门）在社会总产值中的比重已由1950年的55.9％上升到1958年的64.8％。
    十年来，德意志民主共和国在工业生产增长速度方面远远超过资本主义国家。1950年至1958年，德意志民主共和国工业生产每年平均增长率为13％，而美国仅为3.7％，英国为2.9％，法国为7.2％。今年，德意志民主共和国工业产量将比1949年增加二点五倍，而西德从1950年到1958年只增加一点一倍。
    大家知道，旧德国的工业十分发达，但是，希特勒法西斯所挑起的第二次世界大战给德国东部的工业造成了严重的破坏。在战后的1946年，工业生产水平只等于战前1936年水平的42％。但是，英勇的工人阶级在党的领导和苏联的帮助下，迅速恢复工业生产，通过两年计划（1949—1950）的实施，到1950年就使工业生产达到了和略为超过战前水平。
    德意志民主共和国工业的另一个显著的变化是逐步消除了工业各部门的发展不平衡状态，积极着手建立新的工业体系。战前，高度工业化的德国有一个统一的工业体系，战后，由于德国的分裂状态，这个体系被破坏了。据统计，1936年的德国东部工业产值只等于全德的33％，重工业很不发达。在工业的分布上，东部地区比较发达的主要是加工工业、褐煤开采、纺织工业、光学与精密仪器制造业以及化学工业的一些部门；至于工业原料则极端缺乏。针对这种情况，党和政府在执行第一个五年计划（1951—1955）期间就采取了着重发展冶金工业和机械工业的方针；在第二个五年计划（1956—1960）中，又提出优先发展基本原料工业（采煤、电力和化学工业）的任务。近十年来，这些作为工业基础的重工业部门得到特别快的发展。其中，机械工业发展最快，现在机器制造业的生产比1949年提高三倍。
    在社会主义国家互助合作的条件下，经过十年奋战，德意志民主共和国的重工业在1958年已占工业总产值中的60.4％，轻工业占24％，食品工业占15.6％，基本上已建立工业部门中的协调关系。现在，德意志民主共和国的工业已具有高度技术水平，拥有一支占全国职业人口80％以上的强大职工队伍。这是一个具有重大意义的变化。
    在高速度发展工业的同时，农业生产也取得了重大的成就。
    十年来，随着农业合作化、机械化的进展，由于采取了一系列增产的技术措施，德意志民主共和国农作物单位面积产量有了迅速的提高。战争结束后，经过几年艰苦的恢复工作，1951年全国农作物单位面积产量就已经达到或接近战前水平。1950年谷物每公顷产量为二千零七十公斤，现在已达到二千五百二十公斤，即增加20％以上。早在1957年，玉蜀黍的单位面积产量就已占欧洲（不包括苏联）第三位，各种麦类占第五位。去年，德国统一社会党提出要在1962年以前实现居民粮食全部自给自足的战斗口号，这对农业生产的进一步高涨起了极大的鼓舞和推动作用。
    在德意志民主共和国历年的农业总产值中，牲畜业生产占三分之二以上，农民的收入也以牲畜业为主。因此，发展这个部门的生产在农业中具有特别重要的意义。战后，牲畜总头数不断增长。1938年，德国东部地区有牛三百六十多万头，猪五百七十万口，羊一百七十多万只。到1951年，牲畜头数就已超过这一水平。今年上半年全国饲养的各种牲畜总头数已大大超过1938年同类牲畜全年的头数，牛达到了四百四十万头，猪七百八十多万口，羊二百多万只。现在，猪的头数在欧洲占第四位，如按人口平均计算，则已超过西德。
    实行农业社会主义改造是德意志民主共和国发展农业生产的一项基本政策。自从1952年大规模开展农业合作化以来，合作化运动已取得巨大进展。到现在为止，全国已有九千六百个农业生产合作社，它们的耕地面积共占全国耕地总面积的40.9％；连同七百个国营农场在一起，则全国已有差不多50％的耕地属于社会主义成分。
    农业机械化是发展农业生产的决定性步骤之一。现在，全国各地已有拖拉机站六百个。目前，由拖拉机站服务的耕地占全国耕地的75％，在拖拉机站所服务的耕地中，有75％的面积用机器犁田，一般谷物的播种和收获工作的机械化程度达到37％。
