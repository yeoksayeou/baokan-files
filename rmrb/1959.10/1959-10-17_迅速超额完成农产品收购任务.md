Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on to continue mobilizing the masses to launch an even greater upsurge.

\tThe Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls for continued mobilization of the masses to launch an even greater upsurge.
\tRapidly Overfulfill Agricultural Product Procurement Tasks
\tComrades Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin requested in a telephone conference that all localities oppose rightism and exert great effort, grasping both procurement and sales.
\tDoing a good job in agricultural product procurement can increase industrial raw materials, increase market supply, increase commune accumulation, and increase commune members' income, achieving four benefits at once, which is of great significance to the country, the collective, and individuals.

\tRiding on the victory and making persistent efforts to launch a greater upsurge in agricultural product procurement, striving to rapidly complete and overfulfill the agricultural product procurement tasks. This is the call issued by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to party committees at all levels, financial and trade departments at all levels, rural cadres, and the broad masses of peasants at a telephone conference held on the 15th.

\tLi Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Comrade Tan Zhenlin. Responsible comrades from the relevant financial, trade, and agricultural departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as secretaries of the party committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in charge of financial and trade work and responsible comrades from agricultural departments, attended the meeting.

\tComrade Li Xiannian said at the meeting that the recent agricultural product procurement situation in various localities is very good. Encouraged by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the movement to oppose rightism and exert great effort, and the vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy have been further deepened. Party committees at all levels have universally strengthened their leadership over agricultural product procurement work, grasping it tightly, early (one or two months earlier than last year), and meticulously. While vigorously engaging in the "Three Autumns" movement, an agricultural product procurement movement centered on grain, cotton, and oil has been vigorously launched in most parts of the country. The movement is very strong, the procurement progress is rapid, the procurement quantity has greatly increased, and the procurement speed is faster than in the same period last year. Some provinces have particularly fast progress. For example, since the new grain of this year came on the market, provinces such as Guizhou, Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi have overfulfilled or are close to completing the annual grain purchase tasks. Guizhou Province has completed 103% of the annual grain purchase task, and Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces have completed more than 90%. Many counties in other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also completed or overfulfilled the procurement tasks of grain or other agricultural products.

\tAfter emphasizing the great significance of doing a good job in the current agricultural product procurement work for ensuring grain and light industrial raw materials, further improving market supply, and meeting export needs, Comrade Li Xiannian said that although the current procurement situation is very good, the work has only just begun, and the victory is only preliminary. The second half of October and November are the decisive periods for agricultural product procurement work. In order to strive for a complete victory in procurement work, strive to rapidly and overfulfill the agricultural product procurement tasks, and timely procure the agricultural and sideline products and local specialties that should be procured during this period, it is required that all localities achieve:

\tFirst, the whole party should be mobilized, ride on the victory, and launch a greater procurement upsurge.

\tThe overall procurement movement is very good, but the development is uneven. The procurement upsurge has arrived in most areas, but in a small number of areas, the upsurge has not yet formed. Some are because the harvest season of crops is later, and some have some problems in their work. These areas need to continue to mobilize the masses and quickly launch an upsurge. In areas where the upsurge has already arrived, the development of grassroots units is also uneven. According to investigations in some places, among the grassroots procurement units, those that are vigorously promoting and fully acting account for 80% to 90%, and there are still 10% to 20% of the units whose indicators are lagging behind, whose actions are slow, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. These units need to catch up quickly. The development of various agricultural product procurement work is also uneven. Cotton procurement has formed an upsurge with rapid progress; the procurement upsurge of flue-cured tobacco, jute, etc. has just formed; and the upsurge of grain and oil procurement has not yet fully formed, and needs to be accelerated. It is hoped that all provinces and regions will check the procurement progress of each county, commend the advanced, promote the backward, grasp both ends, and drive the middle. Whichever area has a problem, grasp that area, and whichever variety has a problem, grasp that variety. While doing a good job in production work such as autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn planting, deep plowing of land, and water conservancy construction, do a good job in agricultural product procurement work.

\tSecond, vigorously publicize the Party's General Line, grasp politics, grasp ideology, ensure the healthy development of the procurement movement, be both vigorous and down-to-earth; both complete the task and implement the policies.

\tThe procurement movement must be led by politics. All localities must continue to vigorously publicize the general line of building socialism, oppose rightism, and exert great effort. It is necessary to conduct political and ideological education for the broad masses of cadres, and to strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance for the peasants. The publicity and education of the General Line and the criticism of right-leaning thoughts is a class struggle on the political and ideological front. The in-depth development of this struggle is the ideological foundation for the smooth development of the procurement movement. Right-leaning conservative thoughts that hinder the procurement movement, such as the "advanced suffer losses" and "backward take advantage" theories, should continue to be criticized. Among cadres, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the fear of difficulties and slackening thoughts, launch a red flag movement, learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced.

\tSince the amount of agricultural products purchased this year is relatively large and the time is very concentrated, we must find all means to ensure that the procurement business closely follows the needs of the development of the procurement situation. Such as the inspection of product quality, the arrangement of transportation plans, the storage and processing of products, and the payment and clearing of funds, all should be done well.

\tIn the process of procurement, attention should be paid to investigation and research and the implementation of policies. It is necessary to verify grain production, purchase all the grain that should be purchased, and do not buy excessive grain. The purchase of grain should first arrange for the farmers' rations, feed, and seeds, and unify the tasks and policies.

\tThird, the procurement movement should grasp the large ones, drive the medium and small ones, take grain, cotton, and oil as the center, drive others, and strive to expand the amount of commodities on the basis of increased production.

\tIt is right for all localities to first focus on grasping the large, concentrated, and homegrown products in the procurement movement, but due attention should also be paid to the scattered, dispersed, and wild products. Wild plants have great potential, such as wild fiber, wild starch, and Chinese medicinal materials. The State Council has instructed all localities to regard it as a "small autumn harvest" or "secondary autumn harvest," and to mobilize the masses in a short-term blitz to vigorously engage in it. The current issue is to squeeze out time, organize forces, and take action. Do not miss the opportunity and do not let this great wealth rot in the mountains. Commercial departments, forestry departments, and other relevant departments should cooperate well in this work. The varieties and plans to be purchased should be explained to the farmers in advance, so that the farmers can concentrate their efforts on collecting what the country needs.

\tFourth, the movement should start well and end well, implement it to the end, and leave no tail.

\tNow the procurement movement is very strong, which is a good start. We must persist to the end and prevent the front from being tight and the back from being loose. According to the national agricultural product procurement plan, if the task is still 10% or 5% short, although it is a tail, the numbers are still considerable. According to the experience of previous years' procurement, the work tends to be more difficult in the later stages, and more in-depth and meticulous work is required. We must not take the finishing work lightly and should continue to strengthen leadership, strengthen inspection and assistance, until 100% of the task is completed or the task is overfulfilled. Of course, for some products that need to be purchased all year round, we should adhere to regular procurement and combine regular procurement with surprise procurement.

\tFifth, grasp both procurement and consumption, and combine planned grain consumption, economical grain consumption, and the procurement movement.

\tThe fundamental way to solve the grain problem is to increase production, but the distribution work is also very important. The root of grain is in the countryside. Farmers are the producers of grain, and farmers have the largest population, so they are also the largest grain consumers. If we do a good job in planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption in rural areas, and arrange the grain consumption in rural areas well, the grain problem will be half solved. Therefore, we must grasp both procurement and sales. The masses are very supportive of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions on planned grain consumption, economical grain consumption, and the principle of diligence and frugality. As long as the leadership is determined and consults with the masses, this principle will surely achieve good results. At present, all localities should also pay attention to doing a good job in the later stage field management of autumn vegetables, and doing a good job in the harvesting, processing, and storage of autumn vegetables and potatoes, and strive to reduce losses.

\tSixth, grasp the transportation, allocation, and processing of agricultural products.

\tTransportation work is still a relatively weak link in the current procurement movement. All localities should prominently grasp this work, especially short-distance transportation. It is hoped that all localities will strive to concentrate the grain, cotton, and oil that will be transferred out this winter and next spring to the traffic lines. Sichuan Province has transported two-thirds of its grain to the traffic lines because transportation is tightly grasped. Henan Province has created very good experience in direct transportation, saving a large amount of labor and expenses. Party committees in various localities should make overall arrangements for the rural labor force so that each task is assigned the necessary labor force, with both division of labor and cooperation, and both production and procurement, processing, and transportation are done well.

\tSeventh, vigorously organize the supply of industrial products to the countryside, and the People's Bank should guarantee the supply of procurement funds.

\tAfter selling agricultural products, farmers need to purchase a large number of industrial products. All industrial products suitable for rural needs should be given priority to supply to rural areas. The supply of means of production should currently focus on quickly transferring the equipment and materials needed for rural water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, as well as agricultural product processing tools, to rural areas. Party committees in various localities should lead the commercial departments to check this work. More importantly, they should also actively organize industrial departments to increase production, actively lead and help handicraft departments and commune industries increase production of various products, expand the source of goods from multiple aspects, increase supply, and strive to meet the requirements of rural areas. The supply of industrial products to the countryside is of great significance for supporting agricultural product procurement, supporting agricultural production, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

\tComrade Li Xiannian finally said that agricultural product procurement work is about to enter a decisive stage. We must seize the opportunity, ride on the victory, complete it in one go, and not lose the opportunity. Doing a good job in agricultural product procurement can increase industrial raw materials, increase market supply, increase commune accumulation, and increase commune members' income, achieving four benefits at once, which is of great significance to the country, the collective, and individuals.

\tComrade Tan Zhenlin continued, saying that to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural products, we must first do a good job in political and ideological work, and do a good job in opposing rightism and exerting great effort. The current situation is very good. Whether the procurement task can be completed or exceeded depends on whether there is right-leaning thought in the procurement work and whether the effort is great enough. Wherever ideological work is grasped tightly and right-leaning is thoroughly opposed, the procurement work will certainly be done well.

\tHe also pointed out that this year, thanks to the great victory of the people's communes in the fight against drought, grain production has increased even more than the Great Leap Forward last year. Therefore, as long as we give full play to our initiative, we have the conditions to strive to exceed the grain purchase task, but we must strive to exceed it on the basis of overall arrangement. First of all, we must do a good job in arranging the grain purchase, rations, feed, reserve grain, and living arrangements of each people's commune and each production team. If we arrange our lives well, the work will be proactive. This year, grain production has increased. In addition to completing and overfulfilling the purchase task, we should increase the feed for large livestock and pigs. We must reserve enough feed to develop large livestock and pig raising. Because this is not only related to the increase in non-staple food production, but also related to fertilizer issues and the leap forward in agricultural production next year. The principle of reserving feed is: quantify it by head, allocate it to the field, use special grain for special purposes, and do not misappropriate it. On the basis of increased grain production, this year we should also strive for each commune and production team to retain a certain amount of reserve grain, and public canteens should also have a certain amount of reserves. As for living aspects, we must continue to implement the principle of saving grain, eating more when busy, eating less when idle, eating dry food when busy, and eating thin porridge when idle.

\tIn addition, Comrade Tan Zhenlin asked all localities to vigorously engage in the processing tools for agricultural and sideline products and handicraft tools, and develop the processing industry and handicraft production of the people's communes. He also asked all localities to further grasp the "Three Autumns" work. He pointed out that there are only more than twenty days left for autumn planting, which must be grasped tightly so that the countryside can fully turn to winter production and short-distance transportation movement on the basis of successfully completing the "Three Autumns" work.

　　中共中央书记处号召继续发动群众掀起更大高潮
　　迅速超额完成农产品收购任务
　　李先念、谭震林同志在电话会议上要求各地反右倾鼓干劲既抓收购又抓销售
    把农产品收购工作做好，可以增加工业原料，增加市场货源，增加公社积累，增加社员收入，一举四得，对国家、集体和个人都有极大意义。
    新华社16日讯　乘胜前进，再接再厉，掀起更大的农产品收购高潮，力争迅速完成和超额完成农产品收购任务，这是中共中央书记处在15日召开的电话会议上，向各级党委、各级财贸部门、农村干部和广大农民发出的号召。
    中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、国务院副总理李先念，中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、国务院副总理谭震林在会上讲了话。会议由谭震林同志主持。中共中央和国务院的财贸、农业各有关部门的负责人，全国各省、市、自治区党委主管财贸工作的书记和农业部门的负责人参加了这次会议。
    李先念同志在会上说，最近各地农产品收购情况很好。在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，反右倾、鼓干劲，和轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动进一步深入开展，各级党委普遍加强了农产品收购工作的领导，抓得紧、抓得早（比去年提早一两个月）、抓得细，在大搞三秋运动的同时，一个以粮、棉、油为中心的农产品收购运动，已经在全国大部分地区蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。运动来势很猛，收购进度很快，收购数量大大增加，收购速度都比去年同期快。有些省进度特别快。如从今年新粮登场算起，已经有贵州、四川、河南、陕西等省超额完成或者接近完成全年粮食的征购任务。贵州省完成全年征购粮食任务的103％，四川、河南、陕西等省完成90％以上。其他若干省、市、自治区也有许多县完成或超额完成粮食或其他农产品的收购任务。
    李先念同志着重谈到了做好当前农产品收购工作对于保证粮食和轻工业原料、对于进一步改善市场供应和出口需要的重大意义后说，目前收购情况虽然很好，但是工作还只是开始，胜利也只是初步的。10月下半月和11月份，是农产品收购工作的决定性时期，为了争取收购工作的全胜，争取迅速和超额完成农产品的收购任务，把在这个时期应当收购的农副产品和土特产品及时收购起来，要求各地做到：
    第一、全党动员，乘胜前进，掀起更大的收购高潮。
    目前收购运动总的看来是很好的，但是发展不平衡。大部分地区的收购高潮已经到来，有一小部分地区高潮还没有形成，有的是因为农作物收获季节较晚，有的是工作上有一些问题，这些地区需要继续发动群众，迅速掀起高潮。在高潮已经到来的地区，基层单位的发展也不平衡。据有些地方的调查，在基层收购单位中，大张旗鼓、全面行动的占80％到90％，还有10％到20％的单位指标落后，行动迟缓，群众没有充分发动。这些单位需要赶快跟上去。各种农产品收购工作的发展也不平衡，棉花收购已经形成高潮，进度较快；烤烟、黄麻等的收购高潮刚刚形成；粮食、油料的高潮还没有全面形成，需要加快速度。希望各省、区检查一下各县的收购进度，表扬先进，推动落后，抓两头，带中间。那个地区有问题就抓那个地区，那个品种有问题就抓那个品种。在做好秋收、秋耕、秋种、深翻土地、兴修水利等生产工作的同时，做好农产品收购工作。
    第二、大张旗鼓地宣传党的总路线，抓政治，抓思想，保证收购运动的健康发展，既要轰轰烈烈，又要扎扎实实；既要完成任务，又要执行政策。
    收购运动一定要政治挂帅，各地要继续大张旗鼓地宣传建设社会主义的总路线，反右倾，鼓干劲，要对广大干部进行政治思想教育，要对农民加强工农联盟的教育。总路线的宣传教育和对右倾思想的批判，是一场政治思想战线上的阶级斗争，这个斗争的深入开展，是顺利开展收购运动的思想基础。对于障碍收购运动的右倾保守思想，比如“先进吃亏论”、“落后占便宜”等等，应当继续加以批判。在干部中要防止和克服畏难情绪和松劲思想，开展红旗运动，学先进，比先进，赶先进。
    由于今年农产品收购量较大，时间又很集中，必须想一切办法使收购业务紧紧跟上收购形势发展的需要。如产品质量的检查，运输计划的安排，产品的保管和加工，款项的支付和清理等，都要力求做好。
    在收购过程中，要注意调查研究，执行政策。要核实粮食产量，把应该收购的统通收购起来，也不要买过头粮。征购粮食应该首先安排好农民的口粮、饲料、种子，把任务和政策统一起来。
    第三、收购运动要抓大的，带动中小的，要以粮、棉、油为中心，带动其他，并在增产的基础上，努力扩大商品量。
    各地在收购运动中，首先以主要力量抓紧大宗的、集中的、家生的产品是对的，但对于零星的、分散的、野生的也要给予应有的注意。野生植物的潜力很大，比如野生纤维、野生淀粉、中药材等，国务院已指示各地要把它当作一次“小秋收”“副秋收”，用短期突击的方式，发动群众，大搞一下。当前的问题是挤出时间，组织力量，行动起来。不要把时机错过，不要让这一大笔财富烂在山上。商业部门、林业部门和其他有关部门要很好地配合这个工作。要把收购的品种和计划事先向农民交代清楚，使农民集中力量采集国家需要的东西。
    第四、运动要善始善终，贯彻到底，不留尾巴。
    现在收购运动来势很猛，这是一个良好的开端。必须坚持到底，防止前紧后松。从全国农产品收购计划来计算，如果任务还差10％或者5％，这虽然是个尾巴，但数字却很可观。按照历年收购的经验，往往是越到后期工作越艰巨，越需要深入和细致的工作。决不能把扫尾工作看得轻而易举，应当继续加强领导；加强检查和帮助，直到百分之百的完成任务或者超额完成任务。当然，对于某些需要常年收购的产品，应当坚持经常收购，把经常收购与突击收购结合起来。
    第五、既要抓收购、又要抓消费，把计划用粮、节约用粮和收购运动结合起来。
    解决粮食问题的根本途径是增加生产，但是分配工作也很重要。粮食的根子在农村。农民是粮食的生产者，农民人口最多，因此又是最大的粮食消费者。搞好了农村的计划用粮、节约用粮，把农村的粮食消费安排好，粮食问题就等于解决一大半了。因此，必须既要抓收购，又要抓销售。群众对党中央和毛主席指示的计划用粮、节约用粮、勤俭过日子的方针是非常拥护的，只要领导上决心大，同群众商量，这个方针一定能收到很好的效果。目前各地还要注意做好秋菜的后期田间管理工作，做好秋菜和薯类的收获、加工和贮藏工作，力求减少损耗。
    第六、抓紧运输、调拨和农产品加工工作。
    运输工作仍然是目前收购运动中比较薄弱的环节，各地要突出地把这工作抓起来，特别是短途运输。希望各地争取把今冬明春外调的粮、棉、油都集中到交通沿线。四川省由于运输抓得比较紧，已经有三分之二的粮食运到交通沿线。河南省在直线运输方面创造了很好的经验，节省了大批劳动力和费用。各地党委应当统筹安排农村的劳动力，使每项工作都分配到必要的劳动力，既有分工又有协作，既要搞好生产，又要搞好收购、加工和运输。
    第七、大力组织工业品下乡，人民银行要保证收购资金的供应。
    农民在出售农产品以后，需要购买大量工业品。凡是适合农村需要的工业品，都要优先供应农村。生产资料的供应，目前应该把今冬明春农村水利工程所需要的器材以及农产品加工工具等，迅速调到农村。各地党委要领导商业部门把这工作检查一下。更重要的，还要积极组织工业部门增加生产，积极领导和帮助手工业部门、公社工业增产各种产品，从多方面扩大货源，增加供应，努力满足农村的要求。工业品的下乡对于支持农产品收购、支持农业生产和巩固工农联盟都有重大意义。
    李先念同志最后说，农产品收购工作马上要进入决定性的阶段，要抓紧时机，乘胜前进，一气呵成，机不可失，时不再来。把农产品收购工作做好，可以增加工业原料，增加市场货源，增加公社积累，增加社员收入，一举四得，对国家、集体和个人都有极大意义。
    谭震林同志接着说，抓好农产品的收购工作，首先必须抓好政治、思想工作，抓好反右倾、鼓干劲的工作。现在情况很好，收购任务能不能完成，能不能超过，就看收购工作上是不是有右倾思想，干劲大不大？凡是抓紧了思想工作的，反右倾彻底的，收购工作也一定能够作好。
    他还指出，今年由于各地人民公社抗旱斗争取得了伟大的胜利，粮食比去年的大跃进还增产了。因而粮食征购任务只要发挥积极性，有条件争取超过，但是必须在全面安排的基础上来争取超过。首先必须作好每一人民公社、每一生产队的粮食征购、口粮、饲料、储备粮和生活的安排，把生活安排好了，工作就主动了。今年粮食增产了，除完成和超额完成征购任务外，应该增加大牲畜和猪的饲料。必须留足饲料，来发展大牲畜和养猪。因为这不仅关系到副食品的增产问题，还关系到肥料问题，关系到明年农业生产的跃进问题。留饲料的原则是：按头定量，分配到场，专粮专用，不得挪用。在粮食增产的基础上，今年还应该争取每个公社和生产队都留一定的储备粮，公共食堂也应有一定的储备。至于在生活方面，还须继续贯彻节约用粮，忙时多吃，闲时少吃，忙时吃干，闲时吃稀的原则。
    此外，谭震林同志要求各地大搞农副产品的加工工具和手工业工具，发展人民公社的加工工业和手工业生产。他还要求各地进一步抓好三秋工作。他指出秋种只有二十多天了，必须抓紧，以便农村在胜利完成三秋工作的基础上，全力转到冬季生产和短途运输运动上去。
