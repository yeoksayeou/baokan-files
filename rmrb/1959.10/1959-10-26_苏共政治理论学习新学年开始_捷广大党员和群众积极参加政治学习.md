    New Academic Year Begins for Political Theory Study in the Soviet Union

    This newspaper, Moscow, 25th -- The new academic year (1959-1960) for political theory study in the educational system of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has already begun.

    The Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee and party committees at all levels conducted various preparatory works in the first half of this year. Based on the achievements of the previous academic year, the plan is to push the study further. Soviet newspapers and periodicals have published commentaries on the new academic year, unanimously pointing out that the increased demands and high enthusiasm for political theory study among all party members and non-party members are concrete manifestations of the further enhancement of the Soviet people's consciousness and political enthusiasm in the stage of communist construction. In the new academic year, various political studies will be used to further consolidate the Soviet people's communist attitude towards labor, enhance their labor enthusiasm and political activism, improve their moral standards and habits of social self-governance, and further cultivate their spirit of collectivism, internationalism, and patriotism.

    In order to specifically improve the study in the new academic year, the Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee and the Propaganda Departments of the Party Central Committees of various republics recently held regional propaganda conferences in some areas. These conferences summarized the work of the previous academic year, exchanged experiences in organizing study, and determined the tasks and guidelines for the current academic year. Some municipal and state party committees also held plenary sessions specifically to discuss the issue of political theory study, criticizing some of the formalism in learning and the shortcomings of failing to connect with current practice that existed in some party organizations in the past. In the new academic year, party organizations in various regions have decided to greatly improve the ideological content of the study, vigorously promote and organize self-study based on individual independent study and collective discussion based on self-study. It is necessary to further revise the study syllabus and study plan to make the form and content of theoretical study more in line with the needs of the current situation. In order to specifically organize the work of the new academic year, party organizations at all levels have held training classes for propagandists responsible for leading the study, lasting from ten to fifteen days. Large grassroots party organizations stipulate that a study office should be set up in the new academic year to lead the political study of full-time cadres. Publishing houses, newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and all other propaganda organs across the Soviet Union have also launched a series of publicity activities for the new academic year and are preparing various materials to serve the future political theory study.

Czechoslovakia

    This newspaper, Prague, 25th -- Members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the broad masses of working people have shown an increasing interest in political theory study. Through various studies, the political awareness and theoretical and policy levels of the people across the country have been continuously improved, playing an active role in promoting the country's socialist construction cause.

    The CPCz has always attached importance to the political and theoretical education of party members and the masses. After liberation, party schools at all levels began to be established. At present, in addition to a senior party school in Prague, each region also has its own intermediate and primary party schools, and a large number of party members with practical work experience enter party schools every year to study theory. In addition, the CPCz also organizes cadres and the masses for political and theoretical study in various forms. The most common and important form is the annual party class study, which is organized specifically for on-the-job party member cadres and party members on the industrial and agricultural production fronts throughout the country, and also welcomes non-party members to participate. Party class study starts from October each year and ends in May of the following year. Every autumn, the CPCz Central Committee issues a resolution on the party class study for the year, pointing out the focus of the party class study for that year, and party organizations at all levels then formulate specific plans for party class study based on the actual situation in each region.

    In party class study, the CPCz Central Committee places great emphasis on the principle of linking theory with practice. For example, after analyzing the problems and shortcomings existing in agricultural production in Levice County, Nitra State, Slovakia, the county party committee decided to focus on studying the party and the state's policies for developing agricultural production in this year's party class study, so that participants can theoretically and politically and economically understand the importance of improving agricultural production to the development of the national economy and socialist construction. At the same time, in response to the remnants of the influence of bourgeois ideology still existing among farmers, communist ideological education will also be strengthened in party training study. Some factories and enterprises have also formulated specific plans for party training study based on their own specific situations.

    The basic content of party class study stipulated by the CPCz Central Committee includes the party's policies, basic issues of Marxism-Leninism, national economic issues, party building, and party work. In addition, during the year of party class study, various specialized study night schools and Marxist-Leninist night universities are also held in various states and counties.

    The CPCz's party class study system has been established for ten years, and party class study has become a powerful tool for the CPCz to educate party members and non-party masses. In addition to the voluntary and enthusiastic participation of the majority of party members in each year's party class study, more and more non-party masses have also shown a strong interest in party class study. This year, in the Slovak region alone, 100,000 non-party masses participated in this study.

    苏共政治理论学习新学年开始
    捷广大党员和群众积极参加政治学习
    本报莫斯科25日电　苏联共产党教育系统的政治理论学习的新学年（1959—1960）已经开始了。
    苏共中央宣传部与各级党委在今年上半年就进行了各种准备工作。计划在上一学年获得成就的基础上，使学习更向前推进一步。苏联各报刊关于新学年纷纷发表了评论，一致指出，全体党员和非党员对政治理论学习要求的提高和学习情绪的高涨，是苏联人民在共产主义建设阶段觉悟程度和政治热情进一步提高的具体表现。在新学年中，将要通过各种政治学习，进一步巩固苏联人民对待劳动的共产主义态度，提高苏联人民的劳动热情和政治积极性，提高苏联人民的道德水平与社会自治的习惯，进一步培养他们的集体主义、国际主义和爱国主义的精神。
    为了具体的搞好新学年的学习，苏共中央宣传部和各共和国党中央宣传部不久前曾在一些地区召开了分区的宣传会议，在这些会议上总结了上一学年的工作，交流了组织学习的经验并确定了本学年的任务和方针。在一些市委和州委还专门召开了全会讨论政治理论学习的问题，批评了过去在某些党组织中存在的一些学习的形式主义不联系当前实践的缺点。在新学年，各地党组织决定要大大提高学习的思想性，大力推广和组织在个人自修基础上的自学和在自学基础上的集体讨论。要进一步修改学习大纲与学习计划，使理论学习的形式与内容更加合乎当前实际的需要。为了具体组织新学年的工作，各级党组织举办了负责领导学习的宣传员训练班，为期十天到十五天，在大的基层党组织中规定在新学年要设立学习办公室，专职领导干部的政治学习。全苏各地的出版社、报刊、电台、电视台及其它一切宣传机关也对新学年展开了一系列宣传工作，并准备各种材料为今后的政治理论学习服务。
    本报布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党党员和广大劳动人民对政治理论学习表现了日益增长的兴趣。通过各种学习，全国人民的政治觉悟和理论、政策水平不断提高，对国家的社会主义建设事业起了积极促进的作用。
    捷共一贯重视对党员和人民群众的政治理论教育。解放后就开始建立各级党校，目前，除在布拉格有一所高级党校外，各地区还有自己举办的中级和初级党校，每年都有大批具有实际工作经验的党员进入党校学习理论。此外，捷共还以多种多样的形式组织干部和群众的政治理论学习，最普遍和最主要的一种形式是一年一度的党课学习，这是专为全国在职党员干部和工农业生产战线上的党员而组织的，同时也欢迎非党员参加。党课学习由每年10月开始到次年5月结束。每年秋季捷共中央就发出本年度党课学习的决议，指出这一年度党课学习的重点，各级党组织再根据各地实际情况订出党课学习的具体计划。
    在党课学习中，捷共中央十分强调理论联系实际的原则。如斯洛伐克地区尼特卡州列维采县党委会在分析了这个县农业生产中所存在的问题和缺点后，决定在今年的党课学习中，着重学习党和国家发展农业生产的政策，使参加学习的人从理论上和政治、经济意义上认识提高农业生产对发展国民经济和社会主义建设的重要意义。同时针对着在农民中还存在的资产阶级思想影响的残余，党训学习中还将加强共产主义思想的教育。还有一些工厂企业也都根据各自不同的具体情况订出了党训学习的具体计划。
    捷共中央所规定的党课学习的基本内容有党的政策，马克思列宁主义基本问题，国民经济问题，党的建设和党的工作等。此外在党课学习年中，各州、县还举办各种专题学习的夜校和马克思列宁主义夜大学等。
    捷共党课学习制度建立已十年，党课学习已成为捷共对党员和非党群众进行教育的一种有力工具，除了广大党员自愿地踊跃参加每年的党课学习外，愈来愈多的非党群众也对党课学习表现了浓厚的兴趣。今年，在斯洛伐克地区就有十万非党群众参加了这一学习。
