　　Competition Forms a Network, Pace-Setters Form Ranks, Experience Forms a System
    The Mass Movement on Tianjin's Industrial Front is Becoming Increasingly Widespread, Deep, Pragmatic, and Comprehensive
    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, October 19th, reporters Huang Jun and Zhao Yuxin) Like a spring breeze overnight, pear trees bloom in thousands. Under the fighting slogan of anti-rightist tendencies and boosting morale from the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the labor emulation campaign of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" among the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Tianjin is developing in a widespread, deep, pragmatic, and comprehensive direction with irresistible force. At present, a brand-new situation of "competition forming a network, pace-setters forming ranks, and experience forming a system" has emerged in various industries throughout the city. After the broad masses of workers overfulfilled the production plan for the third quarter ahead of schedule, the production level in October is higher every ten days and higher every day. It is expected that the goal of completing the annual production plan half a month ahead of schedule can be achieved. The total industrial output value of Tianjin in September increased by 42.6% compared with August, and the total output value in September was the highest month in history. Although there were fewer working days in the first ten days of October, it still increased by 17.38% compared with the first ten days of September. The output of some products even exceeded that of late September. For example, steel production increased by 15% in the first ten days of October compared with late September. The number of new products successfully trial-produced was 149 in July, 179 in August, and reached 348 in September.
    Competition Forms Blossom in a Myriad of Ways, Technical Innovation is Colorful
    With group competition as the basis, and technical innovation and technical revolution as the center, competition forms blossom in a myriad of ways, and are colorful, and intertwining the broad masses of workers in various industries, processes, types of work, large and small factories into the tide of competition, is a major feature of the current labor competition in Tianjin. From large factories with tens of thousands of people to small factories with dozens of people, a hot atmosphere of competition is everywhere. The "vertical" competition between various industries and the "horizontal" competition between regions are closely integrated. "Four-same" competitions of the same industry, the same type of work, the same product, and the same business are carried out in twelve industries such as steelmaking, steel rolling, cotton spinning, rubber, and vehicles, and three types of work such as foundry workers, electricians, and boiler workers. Inside the factory, there are "counterpart competitions" for workshops, groups, machine tools, and furnace types with comparable conditions; "opponent competitions" for workers of the same level, soldier to soldier, general to general; "hook-up competitions" for upper and lower processes, departments and workshops; some combine several connected processes into a "one-dragon competition"; there are "short-distance competitions" aimed at a sudden task or solving a key problem; there are "performance competitions" in which the masses serve as referees and announce the competition results on the spot, "skillful worker competitions" for textile workers, "coal-saving competitions" for boiler workers, as well as "no waste steel in a hundred furnaces," "no defective products in fifty pieces," and "master-apprentice competitions," and so on. This kind of competition form from the city to the district, from the industry to the group, up and down, left and right, intertwined, weaves a huge competition network, so that the workers in each factory from raw material sorting to finished product delivery, and even cooks, caregivers, and medical staff have "learning, catching up, and surpassing" competition content with each other, thus greatly stimulating the determination of the broad masses to strive for the top, and promoting continuous progress in production. In September, while overfulfilling the production plan, the workers in the city's industrial system also put forward more than 120,000 technical innovation proposals, an increase of six times compared with August.
    Slow Hands Catch Up with Fast Hands, Fast Hands Catch Up with Skilled Hands, Skilled Hands Catch Up with Pace-Setters, Pace-Setters Leap Forward Again
    In the labor competition movement in Tianjin, a prominent feature is also the establishment of pace-setters through large-scale evaluations, comparisons, and establishment of models, and the pursuit, catch-up, and "going upstairs" at all levels from the city, district to industry, factory, workshop, and group. In order not to make some workers feel that the distance to the "pace-setter" is too far, unattainable, and lose the confidence to catch up, many factories divide workers into several levels according to the type of work and technical level, and establish "pace-setters" at all levels, so that everyone has a target to catch up with, so that the broad masses of workers can confidently devote themselves to this movement, and the upsurge of "slow hands catch up with fast hands, fast hands catch up with skilled hands, skilled hands catch up with pace-setters, and pace-setters leap forward again" is surging. Up to now, among the 21,000 production groups in the city's industrial enterprises, more than 12,000 groups have become "five-good" groups with good production, good learning, good management, good collaboration, and good safety and hygiene, and more than 11,000 advanced models of factories, workshops, groups, and individuals have emerged, becoming examples for all aspects of learning and targets for catching up. The Beiyang Yarn Factory had been performing poorly in completing its production plan from January to July, and was rated as the last place in the city's inter-factory competition among the eight major cotton spinning factories. Since August, the factory has been full of energy to strive for the top, so it humbly learns from the experience of brother factories and is determined to surpass the advanced. Improving technical management and other work, the unevenness rate of branches has been reduced from 2.6% in the past to 1.8%, and the first-class product rate of cotton yarn has risen from less than 20% in July to an average of 97% in September. Recently, it has been maintained at 100%, and has entered the ranks of the advanced and surpassed some factories in the same industry. The workers in the third workshop of the third steel rolling factory, who completed the production plan for the first ten days of October ahead of schedule, took the lead in the championship competition. The workers in Class A of the pace-setter group took the lead and rolled 65 tons of steel on the 11th, creating a new record for the class output. The workers in Class C were not willing to be outdone and rose to catch up, surpassing Class A with a new score of 72 tons. Seeing that Class C surpassed Class A, the workers in Class B took a breath and achieved the latest score of 73 tons of class output. After the workers in Class A learned about it, they continued to work hard to maintain the championship. In the upsurge of learning, catching up, and surpassing at all levels, the communist style of the workers has been greatly developed, helping each other and cooperating with each other. The advanced actively help the backward, and the backward humbly learn and strive to catch up. In the learning, catching up, and surpassing movement, the Taidong Weaving Factory proposed the competition method of "old hands help new hands, skilled hands help raw hands, and advanced help backward," and 54 people in the factory originally failed to complete the plan regularly. Through "three helps," 51 people completed the plan, and 31 of them reached the advanced level.
    Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Big Results Everywhere, Production Upsurge is Higher than Another
    In the competition movement, many technical innovation achievements and advanced experiences at home and abroad have been promoted more widely. Under the slogan of "flowers bloom in one place, results everywhere," various industries have formed a mass movement to summarize advanced experiences. One person's experience quickly became the experience of the whole group and the whole factory; and the experience of one factory was promoted in the whole industry, thus obtaining a "large-area harvest." The machinery industry has promoted the experience of the North China Sewing Machine Factory in using white cast iron to transform into gray cast iron, which has basically solved the problem of mechanical castings eating native iron. The paper industry is promoting the experience of "two-stage cooking" of Tianjin No. 3 Paper Mill, which can increase pulp steaming by 40% and save caustic soda by 50%. While selecting 167 pace-setters and 11 pace-setter groups, Tianjin Knitting Factory also summarized 188 advanced experiences, 111 of which have been promoted throughout the factory.
    These experiences have been further supplemented, developed and improved in the process of summarizing and promoting them.
    This new development of the competition movement in Tianjin has powerfully promoted the continuous surge of production. The average daily output value in the first ten days of October increased by 17.38% compared with the first ten days of September. The output of many products is higher than another, and the daily production level is continuously improving. Steel production in the first ten days of October increased by 15% compared with late September. At present, the mass competition movement in Tianjin is steadily and continuously developing, and is promoting the industrial production to leap forward again and again.

　　竞赛成网  标兵成列  经验成套
    天津工业战线的群众运动日趋广泛深入踏实全面
    本报天津19日电　记者黄军、赵玉昕报道：“忽如一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开。”天津市工业战线上广大职工的“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的劳动竞赛运动，在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的战斗口号鼓舞下，正以雷霆万钧之势，向广泛、深入、踏实、全面的方向发展。目前全市各个行业出现了“竞赛成网，标兵成列，经验成套”的崭新局面。广大职工在提前超额完成了第三季度的生产计划以后，10月份的生产水平，又一旬高过一旬，一日高过一日，眼看提前半个月完成全年生产计划的奋斗目标，是可以实现的。天津市工业总产值，9月份比8月份增加42.6％，9月份的总产值，是有史以来的最高月份。10月上旬虽然工作日少，但比9月上旬还增加17.38％。有些产品的产量，还超过了9月下旬。如钢的产量，10月上旬比9月下旬增加15％。试制成功的新产品，7月份有一百四十九种，8月份有一百七十九种，9月份达到三百四十八种。
    竞赛形式百花齐放　技术革新万紫千红
    以小组竞赛为基础，以技术革新和技术革命为中心，在竞赛形式上百花齐放、万紫千红，并且纵横交织地把各行业、工序、工种，大小工厂的广大职工都卷入了竞赛的浪潮，是当前天津市劳动竞赛的一大特色。从上万人的大工厂，直到几十个人的小工厂到处呈现着热气腾腾的竞赛气氛。各行业间的“条条”竞赛，和区域间的“块块”竞赛都紧密地结合了起来，在炼钢、轧钢、棉纺、橡胶、车具等十二个行业，以及铸工、电工、锅炉工等三个工种间开展了同行业、同工种、同产品、同业务的“四同”竞赛。在工厂内部，有条件相当的车间、小组、机台、炉型的“对口赛”；有兵对兵、将对将同等级工人间的“对手赛”；有上下工序、科室与车间的“挂钩赛”；有的把几个连接工序组成“一条龙竞赛”；有以一项突击任务或解决一项关键问题为目的的“短距离竞赛”；有群众自任裁判、当场揭晓竞赛结果的“表演赛”，纺织工人的“能手赛”，锅炉工人的“节煤赛”，以及“百炉无废钢”、“五十匹无次品”和“师徒赛”等等。这种从市到区，从行业到小组，上下左右、纵横交错的竞赛形式，编织成一个庞大的竞赛网，使每个工厂从原材料整理到成品出厂的各个工序的工人，以至炊事员、保育员、医务人员之间都互相有“学、赶、超”的竞赛内容，因而大大激发了广大群众力争上游的决心，推动生产持续不断地前进。9月份在超额完成生产计划的同时，全市工业系统职工还提出了技术革新建议十二万多件，比8月份增加了六倍。
    慢手赶快手　快手赶能手　能手赶标兵　标兵再跃进
    在天津市的劳动竞赛运动中，通过大评大比，大树标兵，从市、区到行业、工厂、车间、小组层层树立、层层追赶、层层“上楼”也是一个鲜明的特点。为不使部分工人感到距离“标兵”过远，可望不可及，失去追赶信心，许多工厂按工种和工人技术水平划分若干等级，各级树立各级的“标兵”，人人有追赶对象，使广大职工满怀信心的投入这一运动，“慢手赶快手、快手赶能手、能手赶标兵、标兵再跃进”的热潮风起云涌。到目前止，全市工业企业两万一千个生产小组中，已有一万二千多个小组成为生产好、学习好、管理好、协作好、安全卫生好的“五好”小组，涌现出一万一千多个工厂、车间、小组和个人的先进标兵，成为各方面学习的榜样和追赶的目标。北洋纱厂1至7月份生产计划一直完成得不好，在全市八大棉纺厂厂际竞赛中，被评末位。这个厂自8月份以来，力争上游的劲头十足，因而虚心学习兄弟厂的经验，决心超先进。改进技术管理等工作，使支数不匀率由过去的2.6％降低到1.8％，棉纱上等品率由7月份的不足20％，接连上升到9月份平均的97％。最近又一直保持百分之百，跨进了先进的行列并超过同行业的一些工厂。提前完成10月上旬生产计划的轧钢三厂三车间职工，在冠军竞赛中，标兵小组甲班工人一马当先，在11日轧制钢材六十五吨，创造班产量的新纪录。丙班工不甘示弱，奋起直追，以七十二吨的新成绩超过了甲班。乙班工人看到丙班超过了甲班，一鼓作气取得班产量七十三吨的最新成绩，甲班工人知道后又继续努力保持冠军。在层层追赶、层层“上楼”的学、赶、超热潮中，职工们的共产主义风格大大发扬，互相帮助，互相协作，先进者主动帮助落后者，落后者虚心学习，奋起直追。泰东织布厂在学、赶、超运动中，提出“老手帮新手、熟手帮生手、先进帮后进“三帮”的竞赛方法，全厂原来有五十四人经常完不成计划，通过“三帮”，有五十一人完成了计划，其中有三十一人达到了先进水平。
    处处开花处处大结果　生产高潮一浪高一浪
    在竞赛运动中，很多技术革新的成果及国内外先进经验，更加广泛的得到推广。在“一处开花，处处结果”的口号下，各个行业都行成了一个总结先进经验群众运动。一个人的经验，很快变成了全组、全厂的经验；而一个厂的经验又在全行业中得到推广，从而获得了“大面积丰收”。机械行业推广了华北缝纫厂用白口铁变灰口铁的经验，已基本上解决了机械铸件吃土铁的问题。造纸行业正在推广天津市造纸三厂的“两级蒸煮”的经验，可以提高蒸浆量40％，节约火碱50％。天津针织厂在评选出一百六十七个标兵人和十一个标兵小组的同时，并总结出先进经验一百八十八项，其中一百一十一项已经在全厂推广。
    这些经验在总结、推广的过程中，并且得到进一步的补充、发展和提高。
    天津市竞赛运动的这一新发展，有力的促进了生产的不断高涨。10月上旬平均日产值比9月上旬增长了17.38％。许多产品产量一浪高过一浪，日产水平持续不断的提高。10月上旬钢产量比九月下旬提高了15％。目前，天津市群众性的竞赛运动，正在巩固地持续不断的向前发展，并推动着工业生产跃进再跃进。
