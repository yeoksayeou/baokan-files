Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th - People's communes have demonstrated unparalleled superiority in changing the face of the countryside. In just one short year, more than half of the relatively poor production teams in Anhui Province have caught up with the relatively wealthy or average production teams. These original "poor teams," relying on the help and support of the people's communes this year, have seen great development in production and a significant increase in the income of their members.

A year ago, when the 1,048 people's communes in Anhui Province had just been established, there were 3,150 "poor teams," accounting for 25.11% of all production teams (basic accounting units) in the province. Today, 554 of these "poor teams" have caught up with the rich teams, accounting for 17.6% of the total number of "poor teams," and their average income has increased by more than double compared to last year; another 1,082 have caught up with the average teams, accounting for one-third of the total number of "poor teams," and their income has increased by more than 60% compared to last year. This extremely huge change occurred after the people's communes were only established for one year and encountered a severe drought. This situation shows that the people's communes have a strong vitality, and that they are changing the poor face of the countryside much faster than the previous agricultural cooperatives.

In the mutual aid and cooperation movement over the years in Anhui Province, countless poor villages and poor areas have changed their poverty-stricken conditions, and the vast countryside is becoming increasingly prosperous. Some of the "poor teams" that still existed when the people's communes were established had already made great progress in production compared to the past; the lives of the farmers had also improved significantly. However, these production teams had more and greater objective difficulties, and the agricultural cooperatives were smaller in scope and weaker in strength, so it was difficult to change their situation all at once before communization.

The failure to solve the water conservancy problem is the basic reason why these "poor teams" have not changed their relatively backward production conditions for a long time. The people's communes, under the principle of equal value exchange, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, organized large-scale labor cooperation to carry out large-scale river network development and water conservancy projects. The water conservancy projects that the "poor teams" could not complete for many years were completed. In this way, they had the ability to resist drought and flood disasters and ensure a bumper harvest of crops. Taking the Bengbu area, which straddles both sides of the Huai River and is prone to both waterlogging and drought, as an example, the water conservancy conditions of the difficult teams have been greatly improved due to the construction of river networks, ditches, and ponds after communization. The Miao'an Brigade of the Caosi Commune in Su County wanted to build a water conservancy project called "Little Yellow River" in the past, but when it was a higher agricultural cooperative, the organization scale was small, and all the labor force did nothing else, specializing in digging river channels, which would take two years to dig; after the establishment of the commune, the entire commune mobilized 8,200 laborers, and after seven days of concentrated effort, they dug this "Little Yellow River." Coupled with other water conservancy construction, this team greatly strengthened its ability to resist disasters, overcame the great drought that it could not get rid of in the past, and achieved a universal bumper harvest of crops. The Yongjiu Brigade of the Weiji Commune in Lingbi County used to be: the high land was eroded by rainwater, and the soil layer was shallow; the low-lying land was also prone to waterlogging, and the crops grown were not guaranteed; after the establishment of the commune, with the support of the entire commune, they carried out water conservancy on a large scale, and a river network was initially realized in one winter and spring, with 33 large and small ditches running vertically and horizontally in the fields, with ditches connected to each other and ditches connected to rivers, so that large rains could be drained, small rains could be stored, and irrigation could be carried out in times of drought. This year, they changed to planting rice and soybeans in the low-lying land, and planted sweet potatoes in the high land, all of which significantly increased the yield per unit area and changed the backward production situation.

In order to help "poor teams" develop production and increase income, the people's communes in various places, under the unified planning of the entire commune, also appropriately allocated "poor teams" to grow more cash crops with high yields and low water requirements, according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, changing the situation in the past when agricultural cooperatives would affect grain production if they grew more cash crops. The Dengta Brigade of the Yaoji Commune in Su County will have an income of more than 43,000 yuan from cash crops alone this year, averaging more than 19 yuan per person. Coupled with water conservancy construction, which basically eliminated the drought, the grain harvested in one season this autumn averaged more than 1,900 jin per person, and this team jumped from a "poor team" to a rich team.

The economic strength of the people's communes in various places, which gave great support to the "poor teams," is an important factor for the rapid change of the "poor teams." The Shiguang Commune in Lai'an County used more than 20,000 yuan of national loans and a part of the commune's accumulation to purchase cattle, farm tools, and fertilizers to support the "poor teams." The Maochong Production Team has barren land, which the masses call "land where rabbits don't shit." The commune allocated 15,000 jin of chemical fertilizer to them, and also helped them make more than 60,000 jin of local fertilizer. The manure on the streets was also contracted to them. As a result, the crops grew well and increased by two times compared to previous years.

The people's communes also adopted the method of advanced leading the backward, and helped the "poor teams" develop diversified economies and expand income in terms of materials and technology. This is more comprehensive and more detailed than the mutual support between agricultural cooperatives in the past. The Jilunzhai Brigade, the best-based brigade in the Jilunzhai Commune in Guoyang County, has supported the "poor teams" with 880,000 saplings, more than 3,000 piglets, more than 61,000 chicks, 206 silkworm seeds, and 28.4 million fish fry in the past year, according to the principle of equal value exchange, and helped them master the technology. Now the six "poor teams" in this commune have changed their poverty-stricken conditions, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have generally increased by about 100%.

In order to change the face of the "poor teams," the Party committees of the people's communes in various places have strengthened their leadership over the "poor teams" and sent capable cadres to work in the "poor teams." This also encouraged the enthusiasm of the members of the "poor teams" and their confidence in changing their situation, so they have achieved amazing achievements in one year.

Now the remaining "poor teams" in the province account for only 12.06% of all production teams (basic accounting units). Although these teams have not been able to catch up with the rich teams or the average teams, they have generally increased production to varying degrees this year, but the increase is slightly smaller. Now, according to the experience of the past year, various places are focusing on helping the "poor teams" to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, and providing support in terms of fertilizers, livestock, and tools to help them develop diversified economies, and strive to change their situation as soon as possible.

　　人民公社无比优越性的又一铁证
    安徽半数“穷队”迅速改变贫困面貌
    554个赶上富队，收入增一倍；1082个赶上一般队，收入增六成
    新华社合肥17日电　人民公社在改变农村面貌上显示了无比的优越性。在短短的一年中，安徽省已有一半以上比较贫困的生产队赶上了比较富裕的生产队或一般生产队。这些原来的“穷队”，今年依靠人民公社的帮助和支持，生产有了很大发展，社员收入显著增加。
    一年前，当安徽省一千零四十八个人民公社刚刚成立的时候，那时共有“穷队”三千一百五十个，占全省所有生产队（基本核算单位）25.11％。今天，这些“穷队”中已有五百五十四个赶上了富队，“占穷队”总数17.6％，他们的平均收入要比去年增加一倍还多；还有一千零八十二个赶上了一般队，占“穷队”总数三分之一，收入比去年增加六成以上。这个极其巨大的变化，是在人民公社刚刚成立一年又遇到严重干旱的情况下发生的。这种情况表明，人民公社有着旺盛的生命力，它对于改变农村穷困面貌，速度比过去的农业社要快得多。
    安徽省在多年来的互助合作运动中，有无数的穷村穷乡改变了贫困面貌，广大农村日益欣欣向荣。到建立人民公社时尚存的一些“穷队”，比起过去，生产上已有很大发展；农民生活也有了明显的改善。但是，这些生产队由于客观困难较多较大，农业社又范围较小，力量较弱，所以在公社化前难以一下子改变面貌。
    水利问题没有解决，是这些“穷队”长期没有改变生产较落后状况的基本原因。人民公社在等价交换互助互利的原则下，组织劳力大协作，大搞河网化、水利化，“穷队”多年办不成的水利工程办起来了。这样，他们就有能力抗御水旱灾害，保证农作物的丰收。以蚌埠专区这个横跨淮河两岸的易涝易旱地区为例，由于公社化后兴办了河网、沟渠和塘坝等水利工程，困难队的水利条件大为改善。宿县草寺公社的苗庵大队，过去就想兴修一项名为“小黄河”的水利工程，但是在高级社时组织规模小，全部劳动力不干别的活，专门开挖河道，也要挖两年才能挖好；公社成立以后，全社调集了八千二百个劳动力，经过七天突击，就挖成了这条“小黄河”，加上其他水利建设，使这个队大大加强了抗灾能力，战胜了过去无法摆脱的大旱灾，取得了农作物的普遍丰收。灵璧县韦集公社永久大队，过去的情况是：高地受到雨水冲刷，土层浅；洼地又容易受涝，种庄稼都不保收；成立公社后，在全社支援下大兴水利，一个冬春就初步实现了河网化，有三十三条大小沟渠纵横于田间，沟沟相通、沟河相通，大雨可排，小雨可蓄，旱时可灌。今年他们在洼地改种水稻、大豆，在高地种植甘薯，都显著地提高了单位面积产量，改变了生产落后面貌。
    各地人民公社为了帮助“穷队”发展生产，增加收入，在全社统一规划下，根据因地制宜的原则，还适当地分配“穷队”多种些收益大、需水少的经济作物，改变过去农业社时若多种经济作物就要影响粮食生产的情况。宿县姚集公社灯塔大队今年仅经济作物的收入就可达四万三千多元，平均每人合十九元多。加上兴修水利，基本上免除了旱灾，今年秋季一季收的粮食，按人口平均每人合一千九百多斤，这个队就由“穷队”一跃而成了富队。
    各地人民公社社有的经济力量，给“穷队”以很大支持，是“穷队”迅速改变面貌的一个重要因素。来安县施官公社用国家的两万多元贷款和公社的一部分积累，购买耕牛、农具和肥料来支持“穷队”。毛冲生产队土地瘠薄，群众称为“兔子不拉屎的田”，公社就拨给他们一万五千斤化肥，又帮助他们自制了六万多斤土化肥，街上的粪也包给他们，结果庄稼长得好，比往年增产了两倍。
    人民公社还采取先进带落后的办法，从物质上、技术上帮助“穷队”发展多种经济，扩大收入。这比过去农业社之间的相互支援更为全面，更为细致。涡阳县纪伦寨公社基础最好的纪伦寨大队，根据等价交换的原则，一年来以八十八万株树苗、三千多头小猪、六万一千多只小鸡、二百零六张蚕种、二千八百四十万尾鱼苗支援“穷队”，并帮助他们掌握技术，现在这个公社的六个“穷队”都已改变贫困面貌，林、牧、副、渔等业一般都增产了一倍左右。
    为了改变“穷队”的面貌，各地人民公社党委都加强了对“穷队”的领导，派遣得力干部去“穷队”工作。这样也鼓舞了“穷队”社员的干劲和改变面貌的信心，因而在一年中，就获得了惊人的成就。
    现在全省剩下的“穷队”，只占全部生产队（基本核算单位）的12.06％。这些队虽然没有能赶上富队或一般队，但是今年一般也都有了不同程度的增产，只不过增产的幅度略小而已。现在，各地正根据一年来的经验，着重帮助“穷队”大修水利，并从肥料、牲畜、工具等方面给予支持，帮助他们发展多种经济，力争尽快地改变面貌。
