　　Coal Production for Nine and a Half Months Exceeds Last Year's Total
　　As of October 15th, National Coal Production Reached 274.5 Million Tons

　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th - Inspired by the Party's General Line, the national coal mine workers are moving from victory to new victory. As of October 15th, the cumulative national coal output had reached 274.5 million tons, exceeding the actual output of 270 million tons in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958 by 1.7%.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the national coal mine workers have been continuously boosting their morale, launching a magnificent large-scale high-yield red banner competition movement from the start of the year. After the announcement of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the workers was further boosted, making the movement for increasing production and practicing economy and the large-scale high-yield competition even more widespread and in-depth. After the intense battles in August and September, many mining bureaus broke the pattern of "slackness at the beginning of the month and tightness at the end," and a comprehensive leap forward situation with high-speed and sustained development of coal industrial production emerged. This is one of the new and important characteristics of the current coal industrial production movement.

　　Currently, under the leadership of local Party committees, coal mines across the country are further engaging in mass movements, vigorously promoting technological innovation, and energetically organizing various forms of labor competitions. Mining bureaus have also universally strengthened the system of leadership cadres following shifts, going deep into the front lines of production, promptly identifying and solving problems, and promoting continuous leaps forward in production. The national coal mine workers are full of fighting spirit, determined to achieve daily red, monthly red, and red to the end, striving to overfulfill the national plan of 335 million tons of coal for this year by ten to fifteen days.

　　不断跃进，力争提前十天到十五天超额完成今年计划！
    煤产量九个半月超过去年全年
    到10月15日止，全国产煤二亿七千四百五十万吨
    新华社17日讯　全国煤矿职工在党的总路线的鼓舞下，从胜利走向新的胜利。到10月15日为止，全国煤炭累计产量已完成二亿七千四百五十万吨，超过了大跃进的1958年的实际产量二亿七千万吨的1.7％。
    全国煤矿职工今年以来不断鼓干劲，从年初就开展规模壮阔的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动。党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布后，更进一步鼓舞了职工的干劲，使增产节约运动和大面积高产竞赛开展得更为广泛深入。经过大战8、9月，许多矿局打破了“月初松，月底紧”的局面，出现了煤炭工业生产水平高速持续发展的全面跃进局面。这是当前煤炭工业生产运动的新的重要特点之一。
    现在，全国煤矿在各地党委领导下，正进一步大闹群众运动，大闹技术革新，大力组织各种各样的劳动竞赛。各矿务局还普遍地加强了领导干部跟班制，深入生产第一线，及时发现问题，解决问题，推动生产不断跃进。全国煤矿职工斗志昂扬，决心作到日日红、月月红、红到底，为提前十天到十五天超额完成今年三亿三千五百万吨煤的国家计划而奋勇前进。
