Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 2nd: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on October 2nd entitled "Glorious Ten Years" to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country.

The editorial said that the people of all fraternal socialist countries, together with the Chinese people, solemnly and joyfully celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is a powerful manifestation of the unbreakable unity and indestructible strength of the socialist camp.

The editorial said that ten years ago, the great Chinese people, under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party, achieved a historic victory and overthrew the dark forces of feudalism and imperialist reactionaries. The socialist revolution triumphed in China. This revolution was the most remarkable event in human history after the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people's revolution gave a new and powerful blow to imperialism and the reactionary camp, and had a tremendous impact on the entire course of world history.

The editorial said that the establishment of the People's Republic of China and China's participation in the fraternal family of the socialist camp once again clearly proved the victory of the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and brought about a major change in the balance of power on the world stage in favor of socialism.

The editorial said that the birthday of the People's Republic of China has become a grand festival for the people of the great socialist camp and all progressive mankind. The Soviet people are happy for the great victory of their friends, the great Chinese people.

The editorial said that the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a manifestation of the vibrant strength of proletarian internationalism. The Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev, delegations from socialist countries, and delegations from many fraternal communist and workers' parties attended the National Day celebrations.

The editorial said that ancient China has undergone a great socialist revolution in the past ten years. The great Chinese people, after breaking free from generations of exploitation and taking their destiny into their own hands, have worked together with revolutionary courage and boundless energy to transform their lives in a new way, and have achieved truly remarkable achievements in this regard.

The editorial said that in a short historical period, China has basically completed the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production, and has forever eliminated the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man. Socialist relations of production have achieved a complete victory in both urban and rural areas. Socialism has also achieved decisive victories on the political and ideological fronts.

The editorial said that the Chinese people, by advancing along the path pointed out by the Party, are rapidly turning their motherland into a developed industrial-agricultural country, which pleases China's friends and frightens China's enemies.

The editorial pointed out that the People's Republic of China and all fraternal socialist countries are constantly strengthening the unity and power of the socialist camp, unswervingly defending the cause of peace and international security, and supporting the oppressed people who are fighting for freedom and independence. Now the whole world sees that the socialist camp is having a strong and positive impact on the destiny of mankind. Comrade Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States eloquently proves this, and this visit is a major contribution to consolidating the cause of world peace.

The editorial emphasized that the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is as solid as a rock. The invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism unites us, and the struggle for the common cause of socialism and communism unites us together. Imperialists and their echoers, the modern revisionists, are doing everything they can to alienate the socialist countries, but such attempts are in vain.

The editorial concluded by saying that the great Chinese people are advancing along the tested socialist road with firm and confident steps. The Soviet people sincerely hope that the Chinese brothers will achieve new and outstanding victories on this glorious road.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 1st: The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today saying: The Korean people, together with the progressive people of the world, warmly congratulate the great People's Republic of China on its tenth anniversary.

The editorial said: "The victory of the Chinese people's revolution decisively strengthened the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and gave an irreparable and heavy blow to the imperialist colonial system. It brought a new turning point to the national liberation struggles of the Eastern peoples striving for freedom and independence and gave a huge encouraging force to the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction. The historical development of the past ten years has confirmed the historical significance of the founding of the People's Republic of China and its great impact on the international situation." The editorial said: Over the past ten years, China has achieved great victories in the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. The general line of the Communist Party of China for socialist construction has driven hundreds of millions of people and generated great material strength. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the task of basically completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. This is a miracle that can only happen under the socialist system.

The editorial said: The establishment of the People's Republic of China has brought the development of the fraternal traditional friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples to a new and higher stage. The editorial emphasized the great significance of the unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The editorial said that for the victory of our common cause, the Korean people will do everything possible to strengthen the friendship and solidarity with the great Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 1st: The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today entitled "A Great Day, Glorious Ten Years," warmly hailing the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people and warmly congratulating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial said, "The establishment of the People's Republic of China is the greatest historical event in the world after the Russian October Revolution. The ten years of rapid progress of New China is a glorious process."

After outlining the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years, the editorial pointed out that today's China has become a huge and powerful country with an ever-developing modern industrial base; with people's communes that are thriving; with a splendid and rich culture; and with a social life in which people's welfare is constantly improving. The editorial said, "The international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China have also increased day by day."

    苏朝越报纸发表社论庆祝我国庆
    中国的成就增强社会主义阵营力量
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联“真理报”2日发表了题为“光荣的十年”的社论，庆祝我建国十周年。
    社论说，所有兄弟社会主义国家的人民和中国人民一道隆重和欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年，这是社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结和不可摧毁的力量的有力表现。
    社论说，十年前，伟大的中国人民，在自己亲爱的共产党的领导下，取得了历史性的胜利，打倒了封建主义和帝国主义反动派的黑暗势力。社会主义革命在中国胜利了，这次革命是继伟大的十月社会主义革命后，在人类历史上最卓越的事件。中国人民的革命给予帝国主义和反动阵营以新的强有力的打击，对世界历史的整个进程产生了巨大的影响。
    社论说，中华人民共和国的成立和中国的参加社会主义阵营各国人民的兄弟大家庭，又一次明显地证明了战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的胜利，并使世界舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的重大变化。
    社论说，中华人民共和国的生日成为伟大社会主义阵营各国人民和全体进步人类的盛大节日。苏联人民为自己的朋友——伟大的中国人民的巨大胜利感到高兴。
    社论说，中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆祝典礼是无产阶级国际主义思想的生气蓬勃的力量的体现。以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团、社会主义各国的代表团以及许多兄弟共产党和工人党代表团参加了这次国庆典礼。
    社论说，古老的中国在这十年间经历了伟大的社会主义革命，伟大的中国人民在挣断了世世代代的剥削的锁链并把命运掌握到自己手中以后，以革命的胆略和无穷的精力，同心协力地用新的方式改造了生活，并在这方面取得了真正卓越的成就。
    社论说，在短短的历史时期内，中国基本上完成了生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，永远消灭了人剥削人的现象。社会主义的生产关系在城乡取得了彻底的胜利。在政治战线和思想战线上，社会主义也取得了决定性的胜利。
    社论说，中国人民由于沿着党所指出的道路前进，正在迅速地把自己的祖国变成发达的工业—农业国，这使中国的朋友感到高兴，使中国的敌人感到恐惧。
    社论指出，中华人民共和国和所有兄弟社会主义国家正在不断加强社会主义阵营的团结和威力，坚持不渝地捍卫和平事业和国际安全，支持在为自由和独立而斗争的被压迫人民。现在全世界都看到，社会主义阵营在对人类的命运产生强烈的良好影响。赫鲁晓夫同志到美国的历史性访问雄辩地证明了这一点，这次访问是对巩固世界和平事业的重大贡献。
    社论强调说，苏中两国人民不可摧毁的友谊像磐石一样地巩固。战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜把我们联合起来，为社会主义和共产主义的共同事业的斗争把我们团结在一起。帝国主义者和他们的应声虫——现代修正主义者费尽心机要想离间社会主义国家，但这种企图是白费心机。
    社论最后说，伟大的中国人民正在以坚定的、满怀信心的步伐沿着经过考验的社会主义道路前进。苏联人衷心希望中国兄弟在这条光荣的道路上取得新的卓越的胜利。
    据新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说：朝鲜人民同全世界进步人民一道热烈地祝贺伟大的中华人民共和国成立十周年。
    社论说：“中国人民革命的胜利，决定性地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，给帝国主义殖民体系以不可挽救的沉重打击。它给争取自由和独立的东方人民的民族解放斗争带来了新的转折，给朝鲜人民为祖国的和平统一和社会主义建设斗争以巨大的鼓舞力量。十年来的历史发展证实了中华人民共和国成立的历史意义和它对国际局势的巨大影响。”社论说：十年来，中国在经济、政治和思想各个战线上取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。中国共产党的社会主义建设总路线带动了亿万群众，产生了伟大的物质力量。中国共产党八届八中全会提出了提前三年在今年内基本上完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的任务，这是只有在社会主义制度下才能发生的奇迹。
    社论说：中华人民共和国的成立，使朝中两国人民的兄弟般的传统友谊的发展进入了一个新的更高的阶段。社论强调了以马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义为基础的朝中两国人民的团结的重大意义。社论说，为了我们共同事业的胜利，朝鲜人民将尽一切力量加强同伟大中国人民的友谊团结。
