Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. Guangxi's over-production campaign is in full swing, rising step by step.

Encouraged by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the more than six million-strong field management army has an even stronger morale and higher fighting spirit. In the plains of southeastern Guangxi, people posted countless big-character posters, folk songs, and clapperdoodles, opposing rightism and encouraging enthusiasm, raising production increase targets, and guaranteeing the Party an over-production of 30%. In the old revolutionary base of Youjiang, there are crowds everywhere weeding, topdressing, picking leaves, and cutting green manure, and local fertilizer plants and local pesticide plants have started operations one after another. Currently, across the entire autonomous region, more than 1.1 million mu of late rice have undergone three rounds of weeding and four rounds of topdressing. Third-class seedlings have generally been upgraded, and first and second-class seedlings have reached 80% to 90%. Nearly ten million mu of coarse grains and cash crops are also generally growing well. In particular, the millions of mu of low-yield mountain valley fields, which are far from villages and have always been neglected, are now producing good crops under the strengthened management of the people's communes.

Guangxi's over-production campaign began in mid-July, with friendly competitions between counties and between communes in full swing. In early August, Huangtian, Xindi, Xiucheng, and four other people's communes in Wuzhou Prefecture broke through regional boundaries and took the lead in launching an over-production competition to all communes in the autonomous region. In less than two weeks, hundreds of communes in various places proposed production increase targets and specific measures, responding to the challenge. In Baise Prefecture, where the Zhuang people live in concentrated communities, communes competed to be advanced, teams competed to be the best, and everyone competed to be first, creating a lively atmosphere everywhere. In Yulin, Nanning, and Guilin prefectures, major competitions were launched in various production tasks to establish pacesetters and surpass pacesetters, with everyone chasing each other and vying for red flags. Xia Zuqun from Heng County, Xie Youqiu from Gui County, Li Jingqun from Cangwu, Liu Ruiying from Teng County, and thousands of other ordinary commune members who are at the forefront of the over-production campaign have now become well-known figures who have caused a sensation in rural areas and have become role models for farmers of all ethnic groups to learn from. Nearly one million commune members and cadres across the autonomous region have formed specialized teams, carrying luggage and tools to set up camps in the mountain valley fields, specializing in eliminating low-yield fields. In mid-to-late September, nearly 300,000 cadres and activists in Yulin, Wuzhou, Nanning, Baise, and other prefectures formed inspection teams at all levels, led by the local Party committee secretaries, and went deep into the fields to conduct large-scale inspections and evaluations, changing third-class seedlings plot by plot and field by field. Of the 1.27 million mu of third-class late rice, corn, and sweet potatoes originally evaluated in Nanning Prefecture, 1.21 million mu have now been upgraded.

Currently, Guangxi's over-production campaign continues to focus on field management, with the emphasis on accumulating fertilizer on a large scale, eliminating low-yield fields and third-class seedlings, and ensuring large-scale balanced production increases. The late rice in Rong County, Cangwu County, Yulin, and other counties is already more than three feet tall, generally better than the early rice. Some cadres and commune members believed that they could sit back and wait for a good harvest. Later, after careful inspection and evaluation, they found that there were still 10% to 20% of the seedlings that were not guaranteed to meet the over-production target. They then went into battle again, heavily fertilizing the seedlings to ensure that not a single mu of third-class seedlings would slip through the cracks. Various places have continuously adopted many new measures to eliminate low-yield fields. Commune members in Fuzhong and Zhaoping counties generally adopted the method of feeding the seedlings, putting a pinch of concentrated fertilizer under the roots of the seedlings to promote the rapid growth of weak seedlings. Now, in the Yulin, Wuzhou, and Nanning prefectures, where the season is earlier, most of the late rice has already reached the stage of pregnancy and heading. The people's communes have generally strengthened late-stage field management, and 4 million mu of late rice have now been fertilized once. Some counties have also promptly carried out five preventions: preventing lodging, preventing diseases and insect pests, preventing drought, preventing birds and animals, and preventing livestock trampling.

During the over-production campaign, many grassroots Party committees have moved their offices to the fields, and many leading cadres have gone to the front lines, participating in the battle to seize fertilizer and joining the ranks of eliminating low-yield fields. Many people's communes have generally strengthened their leadership over backward areas. Guiping County transferred more than 1,000 cadres from 28 communes to settle in backward production teams to help these teams establish a field management responsibility system, formulate labor quotas, and organize commune members to visit advanced areas. Therefore, all tasks have improved compared to the past. Under the active leadership of the dispatched cadres, 369 backward production teams in Cangwu County have entered the ranks of the advanced. The people of the entire region are full of fighting spirit and are determined to realize the over-production plan.

    群众斗志昂扬　禾苗普遍升级
    广西农村超产运动热火朝天
    据新华社南宁电　广西农村超包产运动，如火如荼，步步高升。
    在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，六百多万田间管理大军，士气更加旺盛，斗志更加昂扬。在桂东南平原地区，人们贴出无数大字报、山歌和快板，反右倾、鼓干劲，调高增产指标，向党保证超产三成。在右江革命老根据地，到处是耘田追肥和采叶割青的人群，土化肥厂、土农药厂相继开工。现在，全自治区一千一百多亩晚稻已经过三次耘田、四次追肥，三类禾普遍升级，一、二类禾已达到80％至90％。近千万亩杂粮和经济作物也普遍生长良好。特别是那些远离村庄、一向被忽视的几百万亩山冲低产田，在人民公社加强管理之下，大部分也长出了好庄稼。
    广西的超包产运动是在7月中旬开始的，县与县、公社与公社之间的友谊竞赛热火朝天。8月初，梧州专区黄田、新地、秀成等七个人民公社，突破地区范围，首向全自治区各公社发起了超包产竞赛，不到两周时间，各地就有几百个公社提出增产指标和具体措施，纷纷应战。僮族聚居的百色专区，社社争先进、队队争上游、人人争第一，到处热气腾腾。在玉林、南宁、桂林专区各项生产工作都开展树标兵、超标兵的大竞赛，你追我赶，互夺红旗。走在超包产运动前列的横县夏祖群、贵县谢有球、苍梧李景群、藤县刘瑞英等千百个普通社员，现已成为轰动农村的知名人物，成为各族农民的学习榜样。全自治区有近百万社员和干部组成了专业队，挑起行李工具奔赴山冲田头安营扎寨，专职消灭低产田。9月中下旬，玉林、梧州、南宁、百色等专区，又有近三十万名干部和积极分子，层层组成检查团，在当地党委书记率领下，深入田间开展大检查大评比，逐块逐垌改变三类禾。南宁专区原来评出的一百二十七万亩三类晚稻、玉米和红薯，如今已有一百二十一万亩升了级。
    当前，广西的超包产运动继续以田间管理为中心，重点是大量积肥，消灭低产田和三类禾，确保大面积平衡增产。容县、苍梧、玉林等县的晚稻已有三尺多高，普遍好过早稻，一部分干部和社员便认为可以坐等丰收，后来，经过认真检查评比，发现还有10％至20％的禾苗，没有把握达到超包产指标，他们又挥戈上阵，大泼禾胎肥，保证不让一亩三类苗留混过关。各地不断采取了许多消灭低产田的新措施，富钟、昭平两县的公社社员，普遍采用喂禾兜的方法，把精肥一撮一撮放在禾苗根下，促使弱苗速长快发。现在，季节较早的玉林、梧州、南宁专区，大部分晚稻已含胎抽穗，各人民公社普遍加强了后期田间管理，已经泼过一次禾胎肥的晚稻现达四百万亩。有些县还及时开展防倒伏、防病虫害、防旱、防鸟兽、防牲畜践踏等五防工作。
    在超产运动中，许多基层党委部门已先后搬到田头办公，许多领导干部亲临前线，参加夺肥大战，投入消灭低产田行列。许多人民公社都普遍加强了对后进地区的领导，桂平县二十八个公社下放了一千多干部到后进生产队落户，帮助这些队建立田间管理责任制，制定劳动定额，组织社员到先进地区参观，因此各项工作都较前有起色，苍梧县三百六十九个后进生产小队，在下放干部的积极领导带动下，已跨入了先进行列。全区人民正斗志昂扬，定要实现超包产计划。
