Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. TASS reports: In the first nine months of this year, the Soviet transportation machine manufacturing industry produced 708 diesel locomotives. The total horsepower of these diesel locomotives exceeds 1.4 million, which is more than twice the total horsepower of all diesel locomotives currently in West Germany.

According to calculations by the Soviet State Planning Committee, by 1961, the Soviet Union will exceed the highest production level achieved by the United States in previous years in the production of diesel and electric locomotives. In the last two years alone, U.S. diesel locomotive production has decreased by one-half to two-thirds, while during the same period, the Soviet Union's total diesel locomotive production has doubled to one and a half times. As a result, the Soviet Union has now actually surpassed the United States in diesel locomotive production.

In order to improve the technical level of railway transportation, the Soviet Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, 85% to 87% of the total railway freight volume should be transported by trains pulled by diesel and electric locomotives. The achievements made by the Soviet Union in the production of diesel locomotives in the first nine months of this year are a major step forward in realizing the plan for the technological transformation of railway transportation.

By the end of this year, a total of 1,200 new mainline diesel locomotives and motorized diesel locomotives will be put into use nationwide.

### 苏联内燃机车产量超过美国

　　苏联内燃机车产量超过美国
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在今年头九个月内，苏联运输机器制造业制造了七百零八辆内燃机车。这些内燃机车的总功率超过了一百四十万匹马力，这比西德目前所有的全部内燃机车的总功率大两倍以上。
    据苏联国家计划委员会计算，到1961年，苏联在内燃机车和电气机车的生产方面，将超过美国在几年以前所达到的最高生产水平。仅在最近两年期间，美国内燃机车的产量便减少了二分之一至三分之二，而在同一时期，苏联的内燃机车总产量却增加了一倍至一倍半。这样一来，在内燃机车产量方面，目前苏联实际上已经超过了美国。
    为了提高铁路运输的技术水平，苏联七年计划规定，到1965年，在铁路货运总量中，应该有85％到87％的货物用内燃机车和电气机车所牵引的火车来运输。今年头九个月中苏联在生产内燃机车方面取得的成就，是在实现铁路运输技术改造计划方面前进的一大步。
    到今年年底，全国总共将有一千二百辆新的干线内燃机车和机动内燃机车交付使用。
