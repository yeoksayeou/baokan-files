Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article today stating that a new, small "crater" (pit) has appeared among the several huge "craters" and ring mountains on the surface of the moon. This new "crater" was not formed by a small asteroid accidentally falling on the moon, but was caused by the Earth's envoy—the Soviet's second cosmic rocket—landing on the surface of the moon.

The article stated that when the Soviet's second cosmic rocket arrived at the moon, observations were conducted everywhere. Soviet and foreign scientists have obtained a lot of observation material.

Hungarian astronomer Lovas observed a small black spot and watched it spread out from the beginning until it gradually disappeared. British scholar Colbrook wrote a letter saying that he observed a bright, greenish cloud at the rocket's impact site. Letters have also come from Austria, Sweden, and many other countries.

Some observers have observed the dust and gas clouds rising when the rocket hit the moon. Others saw the shadows of the clouds. According to the observation material, it can be concluded that at that time, due to the impact of the rocket, the dust cloud raised on the lunar surface was as high as 500 to 900 kilometers. Most of the raised soil fell near the explosion site. However, some of it was even thrown to the lunar surface 3,000 kilometers away from the explosion center.

Finally, the article pointed out that the new artificial "crater" can be seen with powerful telescopes, but in the future, this small "crater" will be more easily found by using photographic instruments on interplanetary stations.

    第二个宇宙火箭飞探月宫后
    月球出现新的“火山口”
    “共青团真理报”介绍各国观测结果
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“共青团真理报”今天发表文章说，在月球表面的若干巨大的“火山口”和寰形山中，出现了一个新的小“火山口”（陷坑），这个新“火山口”不是某一个小行星偶然坠向月球所形成的，而是由于地球的使者——苏联第二个宇宙火箭在月球表面着陆时造成的。
    文章说，当苏联第二个宇宙火箭抵达月球时，各地都进行了观测。苏联和外国的科学家们已获得了许多观测材料。
    匈牙利天文工作者洛瓦什观察到了一个小黑点，看到它从开始扩散到逐渐消灭。英国学者科耳布鲁克写信来说，他在火箭坠落地点观测到了带绿色的明亮的云层。从奥地利、瑞典以及其他许多国家都有来信。
    观测者中有一些人观测到了火箭撞击月球时所升起的灰尘和气体的云层。另外一些人看到了云层的影子。据观测的材料可以得出结论说，当时，由于火箭的撞击，在月球表面所扬起的尘土云高达五百到九百公里。大部分升起来的泥土落到了爆炸地点的附近。但是有一部分甚至抛到了离爆炸中心三千公里的月球表面。
    最后，文章指出，新的人工“火山口”用强大的望远镜可以看到，但将来利用行星际站上的摄影仪器，这个小“火山口”就更容易被找到。
