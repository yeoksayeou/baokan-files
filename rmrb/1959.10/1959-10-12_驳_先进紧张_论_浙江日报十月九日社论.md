Refuting the "Advanced are Tense" Theory
--Zhejiang Daily Editorial, October 9th

Currently, under the inspiration of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the vast numbers of cadres and workers on the industrial and transportation front in our province are responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions. They are launching a vigorous and down-to-earth socialist emulation movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced throughout the province. In this movement, many advanced individuals are continuing to exert their energy and strive to be even more advanced; many backward individuals are working hard to catch up with the advanced; and a large number of those who were originally in the middle are not content to remain in the middle and are trying every means to strive for the upper reaches and surpass the advanced. A thriving scene of ten thousand horses galloping forward has emerged on the industrial front.

In our country, the advanced are greatly respected and loved. This is because the advanced represent the direction of human progress. Comrade Liu Shaoqi made it very clear in his congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the National Congress of Advanced Producers in April 1956. He said: "The history of human society, in the final analysis, is the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, and new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Therefore, in any era and in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who use relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their techniques and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society, and social production is improved. If there are major inventions in production technology, it will cause a major reform in production technology and create a huge upsurge in production. Therefore, advanced producers are the pioneers of the forward development of human economic life and also the pioneers of the forward development of human social history." Therefore, all revolutionaries should have full enthusiasm for the advanced, support it, learn from it, and promote it. The advanced should strive to be more advanced, and the backward should strive to catch up with the advanced. Everyone should seize the advanced and make the flowers of advancement bear fruit everywhere.

The advanced is one of the most positive factors in the cause of socialist construction. By developing this advanced factor, the ideological outlook and production outlook of enterprises will undergo rapid changes. Due to the promotion of the advanced, people's thinking has been further liberated, and technical innovation stories have emerged one after another. According to very incomplete statistics from only twelve counties and cities, such as Jinhua and Ningbo, there were 771 technical innovation projects realized in August, of which 56 technical innovation projects in Jinhua County that can calculate economic value can save the country more than 40,000 yuan. Due to the promotion of the advanced, the backward outlook of many enterprises has been changed, and a large number of advanced enterprises and advanced individuals have emerged; for example, among the 40 advanced units in Ningbo City in August, 9 belonged to those who caught up from behind. According to statistics from only four regions of Ningbo, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, and Jinhua, more than 1,600 advanced groups and more than 11,000 advanced individuals have emerged. Due to the promotion of the advanced, people are chasing each other, and production quotas are changing with each passing day. The "Lake Steel" eight-cubic-meter No. 2 furnace produced 21 tons of pig iron per day, with a utilization coefficient of 2.804; the semi-steel 27.5-cubic-meter No. 2 furnace produced 60.33 tons of pig iron per day, with a coke ratio of 1:0.578, both reaching the national advanced level. All of these fully illustrate how much benefit the promotion of the advanced brings to the cause of socialist construction! How significant is it to completing and overfulfilling this year's Great Leap Forward plan!

However, some people currently believe that "the advanced are tense." They one-sidedly emphasize prudence and reliability, fear taking risks, and are satisfied with being better than the bottom but not as good as the top, doing things according to their ability, and reporting and settling accounts according to the facts. This idea of being content with the middle is wrong and, in essence, reflects the small producer's idea of being content with the status quo and not seeking progress; it has nothing in common with the thinking of proletarian revolutionaries. Proletarian revolutionaries have the great ambition to realize socialism and communism, and therefore can strive for the upper reaches and bravely take the lead in any situation; while small producers hold personal plans, gain and loss, and therefore are always cautious in their progress, afraid of dragons in front and tigers behind, and become complacent and self-satisfied with a little achievement, and become afraid and waver when encountering difficulties. This kind of thinking is an important obstacle to our progress. The middle reaches are untenable. Sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat. Those who are temporarily in the middle state will inevitably be washed to the lower reaches by the advancing torrent if they do not strive for the upper reaches.

"If you become advanced, you will be pressured with tasks and become more tense," this is a major "argument" of the "advanced are tense" theorists. The reason why advanced units and advanced individuals become advanced is that they are good at hard work, practical work, and clever work, so they can make more and greater contributions to socialist construction than ordinary units and ordinary people, which should be said to be a supreme honor. In this case, the leadership's higher demands on them precisely reflect the leadership's greater expectations for them. Striving to complete tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, and accelerating the development of social productive forces is a manifestation of every revolutionary's high responsibility for socialist construction. Doing so is beneficial to socialist construction, beneficial to the people, and beneficial to the enterprise and oneself. As for tension, socialist construction is inherently tense. In order to make production rise step by step, it is necessary to become tense, try every means, use your brains, and think of ways to make one new record closely follow another, what's wrong with that? Tension also has two different kinds of tension, one is pleasant tension, and the other is unpleasant tension. Backwardness is a kind of unpleasant tension. From the perspective of the entire country, backwardness makes it easy to be beaten, and the poor life of the people inevitably brings tension; for a unit and an individual, backwardness often leads to passivity in work and production. Therefore, all those who have a sense of responsibility for the cause of socialist construction are happy to take the former kind of tension and strive to get rid of the latter kind of tension. Only those who have lost their will to move forward will covet comfort, willingly lag behind, and be afraid of "tension."

"It's more embarrassing to fall down after being advanced," this is another "argument" of theirs. There are always differences between advanced and backward in production. When the backward catch up with the advanced, under new conditions, new differences between advanced and backward will form again. Therefore, sometimes some people and some units are ahead, and at other times, other people and some units are ahead. This is a normal phenomenon in the process of production development, and there is no question of embarrassment at all. The important thing is that no matter who is in the lead, don't be arrogant, be conscientious, strive to be more advanced, and help those who are behind to catch up. Those who fall behind should not be discouraged. No matter who is in the lead, always learn from him, try to catch up, and strive to surpass. Under normal circumstances, the advanced can continue to maintain the banner of advancement as long as they are free from arrogance and rashness and make persistent efforts. For example, there are Dachang Silk Factory, which has maintained the red flag for three years, the Forging Second Group of the Oxygen Generator Factory, which has maintained the red flag for seven years, and the advanced producer Li Yuyin, who has maintained the red flag for seven years, who are familiar to everyone. However, once you are overtaken by others, as long as you are not arrogant and slack, you can still catch up, and there is nothing more embarrassing. The idea of not striving for advancement because of fear of "falling down more embarrassingly" is, first of all, not seeing that this lack of ambition and willingness to lag behind is itself very embarrassing. Secondly, they did not see that it is not enough to passively fear "falling down." To avoid falling down and always maintain advancement, you must constantly exert your energy and strive for the upper reaches.

The advanced is the red flag of exerting great effort and striving for the upper reaches, the red flag of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and the red flag of high-speed development of social productive forces. The advanced liberates people's minds and breaks all the shackles of old ideas; the advanced promotes the great upsurge of production and accelerates the process of social development; the advanced creates more wealth for mankind and continuously improves people's material and cultural life; the advanced points out the direction of progress for work and makes the entire work progress more smoothly; the advanced has great practical significance for completing this year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule, realizing the main indicators of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule, and catching up with Britain ahead of schedule. The so-called "advanced are tense" is only a reflection of those who do not have a great revolutionary cause in their minds and do not have the great ambition of the proletariat to transform the world. The attitude towards the advanced is a severe test for every revolutionary. Not striving for the upper reaches, but being content with the middle reaches and willingly staying in the lower reaches is not a true socialist. Currently, the socialist emulation movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced is sweeping the province like a prairie fire. People's determination to fight bravely, be high-spirited, and strive for the lead is like the eruption of magma, unstoppable. Let us continue to hold high the glorious banner of the General Line for Socialist Construction, repel right-leaning opportunist thoughts, sweep away bourgeois individualism, everyone leap forward, everyone strive for the lead, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule.

　　驳“先进紧张”论
　　——浙江日报十月九日社论
    目前，本省工交战线广大干部和职工群众，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，以实际行动响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，在全省范围内，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进的社会主义竞赛运动。在这个运动中，许多先进的，正在继续鼓足干劲，力争更先进；不少后进的，正在奋发图强，追赶先进；而大量本来处于中间状态的，也不安于中游，正在千方百计地力争上游，猛超先进。工业战线上呈现一片万马奔腾的兴旺局面。
    在我们国家里，先进受到人们莫大的尊敬和热爱。这是因为先进代表人类前进的方向。刘少奇同志在1956年4月全国先进生产者代表会议上代表党中央所作的祝词中，就讲得很清楚。他说：“人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。如果有重大的生产技术的发明，就要引起生产技术的重大改革，创造生产的巨大高涨。因此，先进生产者是人类经济生活向前发展的先驱，也是人类社会历史向前发展的先驱。”因此一切革命者，都应该对先进具有满腔的热情，支持它，学习它，推广它。先进的要争取更先进，后进的要猛赶先进。所有的人都应抓住先进不放，使先进之花，到处结果。
    先进是社会主义建设事业中的一种最积极的因素。发扬这种先进因素，企业的思想面貌和生产面貌，就会发生急骤的变化。由于发扬先进，进一步解放了人们的思想，技术革新事迹层出不穷。仅据金华、宁波等十二个县、市极不完全的统计，8月份已经实现的技术革新项目就有七百七十一项，其中金华县五十六个可以计算经济价值的技术革新项目就可为国家节约四万余元。由于发扬先进，改变了许多企业的落后面貌，涌现了大量先进企业和先进人物；如宁波市8月份四十个先进单位，其中有九个是属于后进赶上来的。仅据宁波、嘉兴、温州、金华四个地区统计，涌现的先进小组有一千六百多个，先进人物达一万一千余名。由于发扬先进，你追我赶，生产定额，日新月异，“湖钢”八立方米二号炉，日产生铁二十一吨，利用系数达到二点八零四；半钢二十七点五立方米二号炉日产生铁六十点三三吨，焦比1∶0.578，均达到全国先进水平。所有这些，充分地说明：发扬先进，给社会主义建设事业带来多么大的好处！对完成和超额完成今年跃进计划，有多么重大的意义！
    但是，目前有些人却认为：“先进紧张”。他们片面地强调稳妥可靠，怕冒风险，满足于比上不足，比下有余，办事情量力而为，实报实销。这种安于中游的思想是错误的，实质上是反映了小生产者安于现状，不求上进的思想；它和无产阶级革命者的思想毫无共同之处。无产阶级革命者有实现社会主义、共产主义的雄心大志，因而能够在任何情况下力争上游，奋勇争先；而小生产者抱着个人打算，患得患失，因而在前进中老是谨小慎微，前怕龙、后怕虎，稍有成绩，就自满自足，一遇困难，就害怕动摇。这种思想是我们前进中的重要障碍。中游是站不住脚的。逆水行舟，不进则退。暂时处于中游状态的，如果不力争上游，势必要被前进的激流冲到下游去。
    “先进了，要压任务，更紧张”，这是“先进紧张”论者的一个主要“论据”。先进单位、先进人物之所以成为先进，就是由于他们善于苦干、实干、巧干，因而他们能够为社会主义建设作出比一般单位和一般人更多、更大的贡献，这应该说是无上光荣的事情。在这种情况下，领导上向他们提出更高的要求，正是反映了领导对他们寄予更大的期望。力争更多更快更好更省地完成任务，加速社会生产力的发展，这是每一个革命者对社会主义建设高度负责的表现，这样做对社会主义建设有利，对人民有利，对企业对自己都有利。至于紧张，社会主义建设本来就是紧张的，为了使生产步步登高，紧张起来，千方百计，动脑筋、想办法，使一个新纪录紧跟着一个新纪录，有何不好？紧张，也有两种不同性质的紧张，一种是愉快的紧张；另一种是不愉快的紧张。落后就是一种不愉快的紧张。从整个国家来讲，落后了就容易挨打，人民生活穷困，这必然带来紧张；对一个单位和一个人来说，落后了，工作和生产就往往陷于被动。因此，凡是对社会主义建设事业具有责任感的人，都乐于取前一种紧张，而力争摆脱后一种紧张。只有那些丧失前进心的人，才会贪图安逸、自甘落后，害怕“紧张”。
    “先进了掉下来更难看”，这是他们的另一个“论据”。在生产中总是有先进和落后的差别的，当后进赶上先进的时候，在新的条件下，新的先进和落后的差别又会形成，因此，一些时候这一部分人和若干单位赶在前头，另一些时候，又一部分人和若干单位赶在前头，这是生产发展过程中的正常现象，根本不存在什么难看不难看的问题。重要的问题在于，不管谁走在前头，都不要骄傲，要兢兢业业，力争更先进，并帮助走在后头的往前赶。落在后边的人也不要气馁，不管走在前头的是谁，总要向他学习，力求赶上，争取超过。在一般的情况下，先进的只要戒骄戒躁再接再厉，是能够继续保持先进旗帜的。譬如，为大家所熟悉的就有保持三年红旗的达昌绸厂，保持七年红旗的制氧机厂锻工二小组和七年红旗的先进生产者李裕银。但是，一旦自己被别人赶上去，只要自己不骄傲、松懈，还可再赶上去，也没有什么更难看。那种怕“掉下来更难看”因而不去力争先进的想法，首先是没有看到这种缺乏志气自甘落后的思想本身就是非常难看的。其次他们没有看到光消极地怕“掉下来”是不行的，要不掉下来永远保持先进只有不断鼓干劲、争上游才行。
    先进是鼓足干劲，力争上游的红旗，是多快好省建设社会主义的红旗，是高速度发展社会生产力的红旗。先进解放人们的思想，打破一切陈旧思想的束缚；先进促进生产的巨大高涨，加速社会发展的进程；先进为人类创造更多财富，不断提高人们的物质文化生活；先进为工作指明前进的方向，使整个工作进展更为顺利；先进对提前完成今年的跃进计划，提前实现第二个五年计划的主要指标，提前赶上英国都具有巨大的现实意义。所谓“先进紧张”只不过是那些头脑中没有伟大的革命事业，没有无产阶级改造世界的雄心大志的人的反映。对待先进的态度，对每一个革命者是严峻的考验，不力争上游，而安居中游、甘居下游，就不是真正的社会主义者。目前在全省范围比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进的社会主义竞赛运动，有如野火燎原，席卷全省。人们斗志昂扬，意气风发，奋勇争先的决心，有如熔岩喷发，锐不可当。让我们继续高举社会主义建设总路线的光荣旗帜，击退右倾机会主义思潮，横扫资产阶级个人主义思想，人人跃进，个个争先，为提前完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划而奋斗。
