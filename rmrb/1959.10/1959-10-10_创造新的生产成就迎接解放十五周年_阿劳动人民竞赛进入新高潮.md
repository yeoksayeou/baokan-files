Create New Production Achievements to Greet the 15th Anniversary of Liberation
Albanian Laboring People's Competition Enters a New Upsurge

(Our correspondent, Ge Baozhi, reports from Tirana on the 8th) A socialist labor competition movement to welcome the 15th anniversary of the motherland's liberation is flourishing throughout Albania.

Whether in the capital, Tirana, or in other cities, whether in factories, mines, or in the countryside, you can see challenge bulletin boards, glorious red lists, and eye-catching competition slogans everywhere. Friendly competitions are taking place everywhere between people, teams, and factories. According to statistics from the Albanian General Trade Union, more than 390 factories, mines, and labor collectives have participated in the competition so far, and hundreds of production innovators and rationalization initiators have emerged. More than 670 production teams are striving to win the glorious title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation," with over 7,200 participants.

To welcome the national holiday of the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation on November 29, the broad masses of Albanian working people proposed as early as the end of last year to offer gifts to the motherland with a high tide of production. In January of this year, young workers at the Stalin Textile United Factory first proposed the initiative to strive for the title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation." The conditions for the competition were: all members of the production team must carry out production in a good and economical manner, and at the same time, they must continuously improve their technical and cultural level and their communist consciousness. This initiative received the active support of the Albanian Labor Party, trade unions, and youth leagues, and was quickly promoted from within the factory to outside the factory, and from the capital to all parts of the country. The number of production teams striving to win the glorious title increased day by day. In the first half of this year, it reached 347, and by the end of August, it had surged to 674, including more than 80 production teams from agricultural cooperatives, with over 7,200 participants. Good news of exceeding the original production quotas and completing the plans ahead of schedule also kept pouring in one after another. In the first six months of this year, 297 production teams completed their production plans more than ten days ahead of schedule, increasing the country's output by more than 28 million lekë (Albanian currency) and reducing costs by more than 10 million lekë. Employees in twenty-two factories in the capital, Tirana, broke the old quotas.

With the upsurge of the competition, advanced workers, based on their own labor nature, the conditions of their factories and mines, and the conditions of their competitors, put forward a variety of competition contents. Some proposed reducing costs as the main link in the competition, some proposed saving raw materials, some proposed increasing the utilization rate of tools, and some proposed not wasting time...etc. All of these enriched the socialist competition and were quickly accepted by the broad masses of working people throughout the country. The Misto Mamei production team, which advocated saving raw materials, saved raw materials worth more than 620,000 lekë in just three months. The movement to not waste time was first proposed by workers at the Durrës Tobacco Factory. They advocated cherishing every minute and second, and using time rationally and effectively, putting all their energy into production.

The rationalization proposal movement, which began last year, is even more in-depth today. By the end of June, workers and farmers across the country had put forward more than 19,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 9,000 had been reviewed and approved, and 3,391 had been adopted and implemented, creating a total value of more than 120 million lekë.

At present, the exemplary deeds of the advanced Soviet textile worker and Communist Party member, Gaganova, in helping the backward to catch up with the advanced, are inspiring workers throughout Albania. Gaganova's lofty communist style is educating thousands of workers, making them more actively contribute all their strength to the collective cause.

Many outstanding workers in Albania are asking to be transferred to backward production teams. Visar Bana is an advanced work team leader at the Stalin Textile Factory. The production team he leads completes an average of 113% of the production plan every month. In order to learn from Gaganova and seek a common upsurge in production, he does not care about personal gains and losses and voluntarily asked to go to a production team that often completes 77% of the plan to help them improve labor organization and improve technology. With his reasonable arrangements and patient help, the backward production team has rapidly risen to the level of completing 100% of its tasks. People like Bana are not isolated, and many outstanding figures and moving stories continue to emerge in the movement.

In the vast countryside, the socialist competition is also in full swing. For example, in the Borsh Agricultural Cooperative in Saranda City, at the southernmost tip of Albania, ten young people are striving to win the title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation." They worked day and night, reclaiming 17 hectares of wasteland, burning 240,000 bricks, and planting more than 500 orange trees in a short period of time. This year, each of them has reached more than 240 workdays. Therefore, the Saranda City Youth League organization not only approved their team as the "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation," but also named their team after the national hero, Qasim Llari. Workers at the Luzenze Tractor Station completed their annual plan on September 17, setting a new national record of completing the annual plan one month and twenty days ahead of schedule.

At present, workers and farmers across Albania are pushing the movement to a new climax, determined to greet the upcoming 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland with greater victories.

    创造新的生产成就迎接解放十五周年
    阿劳动人民竞赛进入新高潮
    本报地拉那8日电　本报记者戈宝植报道：为迎接祖国解放十五周年的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，正在阿尔巴尼亚全国各地蓬勃展开。
    不管在首都地拉那或者在其他城市，不管在工厂、矿山或者在农村，你到处都可以看到挑战的墙报、光荣的红榜和醒目的竞赛标语。人与人、队与队、厂与厂之间到处都在展开友谊的竞赛。据阿尔巴尼亚总工会统计，到目前为止，参加竞赛的已有三百九十多个厂矿和劳动集体，涌现出了几百个生产革新者和合理化倡议者，为争取获得“祖国解放十五周年生产队”这一光荣称号的生产队，已有六百七十多个，参加的人数达七千二百多人。
    为迎接11月29日阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年这个全民的节日，早从去年年底，阿尔巴尼亚广大劳动人民就提出了要以生产的高潮来向祖国献礼。今年1月，斯大林纺织联合工厂的青年工人，首先提出了争取“祖国解放十五周年生产队”称号的倡议，竞赛的条件是：生产队的全体成员必须又好又省地进行生产，同时必须不断地提高技术、文化水平和共产主义的觉悟。这个倡议获得了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、工会和青年联盟的积极支持，很快地就从厂内推广到厂外，从首都推广到全国各地。为争取获得光荣称号的生产队一天比一天增多，今年上半年就已达三百四十七个，到8月底，更激增到了六百七十四个，其中有八十多个是农业合作社的生产队，参加人数达七千二百多人。超过原有生产定额提前完成计划的捷报也一个接着一个传来，在今年头六个月中，有二百九十七个生产队分别提前十多天完成了生产计划，他们为国家增产了二千八百多万里克（阿币），降低成本一千多万里克。首都地拉那有二十二个工厂的职工打破了旧有的定额。
    随着竞赛热潮的高涨，先进工人根据自己的劳动性质、自己厂矿和竞赛对手的条件，纷纷提出了多种多样的竞赛内容。有的提出以降低成本为竞赛的主要一环，有的提出了节省原材料，有的提出了增加工具的使用率，有的提出了不浪费时间……等等。所有这些更丰富了社会主义竞赛，并且很快地为全国广大劳动人民所接受。倡议节约原材料的米斯托·马麦生产队，仅仅三个月内节省下的原材料，就价值六十二万多里克。不浪费时间的运动首先是都拉斯烟草厂工人提出的，他们倡议要珍惜一分一秒的时间，要十分合理、有效地利用时间，把全部的精力都用到生产中去。
    从去年就已开始的合理化建议运动，今天更加深入了。到6月底，全国各地工人、农民提出的合理化建议已达一万九千多条，其中审定的已有九千多条，被采纳实施的有三千三百九十一条，它们所创造的价值共达一亿二千多万里克。
    目前，苏联先进纺织女工、共产党员加干诺娃的帮助落后赶先进的模范事迹，正鼓舞着全阿尔巴尼亚的工人。加干诺娃崇高的共产主义风格教育着千万工人，使他们更积极地为集体事业贡献一切力量。
    阿尔巴尼亚很多的优秀工作者都要求转到落后的生产队去。维赛尔·巴纳是斯大林纺织厂的一个先进工作队队长，他领导的生产队平均每月都完成生产计划113％，为了向加干诺娃学习，求得生产的共同高涨，他毫不计较个人的得失，自愿请求到经常完成计划77％的生产队去，帮助他们改进劳动组织和提高技术。在他合理的安排和耐心的帮助下，落后生产队已迅速地提升到百分之百地完成任务的水平。像巴纳这样的人并不是个别的，许多出色的人物和动人的故事不断地在运动中涌现出来。
    在广大的农村，社会主义竞赛也同样热火朝天。例如在阿尔巴尼亚极南端的萨兰达城的鲍尔萧农业合作社，有十个青年为争取获得“祖国解放十五周年生产队”的称号，他们夜以继日地劳动，在短短的时间内就开垦了十七公顷荒地，烧出了二十四万块砖，种上了五百多棵桔子树，今年他们每人的劳动日都已达到二百四十多个，因此萨兰达城的青年联盟组织不仅批准了他们队为“祖国解放十五周年生产队”，并且以民族英雄加赛姆·拉里的名字为他们的队命名。卢森泽拖拉机站的工人在9月17日就完成了年度计划，创造了提前一个月零二十天完成年度计划的全国新纪录。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚全国工人和农民正把运动推向一个新的高潮，决心以更大的胜利来迎接即将到来的祖国解放十五周年。
