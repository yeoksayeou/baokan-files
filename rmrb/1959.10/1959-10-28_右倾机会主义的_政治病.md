    The "Political Sickness" of Right-leaning Opportunism
    Frankly speaking, our summation and propaganda regarding the great achievements of 1958 were not too “prominent,” but rather not done enough. In the future, we must further and vigorously extol the great year of 1958, let 1958 be eternally recorded in the socialist annals, and let the Party's general line for socialist construction, as stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the lives of the people throughout the country.

    Of course, in such a great mass movement as in 1958, it is impossible not to produce some temporary and localized shortcomings. All these shortcomings, when added together, are still in the relationship of one finger to nine fingers when compared with the great achievements of 1958. Even with only one finger's worth of shortcomings, the Party has never relaxed its attention to them. Under the personal leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, these shortcomings, mentioned above, were discovered and overcome in a timely manner. However, the right-leaning opportunists made a pessimistic assessment of the increasingly favorable situation and ran out to vehemently accuse our Party of "not exposing the shortcomings enough." Why are they clinging so tightly to these shortcomings that have already been resolved or simply do not exist? It seems that they simply want to exaggerate this one finger's worth of shortcomings to be thicker than a thigh, wanting to hold us back from continuing to leap forward, wanting to replace the Party's general line with their right-leaning opportunist line. They relish chewing on shortcomings so much, just like owls, who cannot survive without darkness.

    Every analogy has its limitations. Owls are afraid of light and like darkness because of physiological reasons. Right-leaning opportunists are, after all, human beings, not owls, so why are they also afraid of light and like darkness? This is because they are suffering from a political sickness, and the name of this sickness is "fear of revolutionary mass movements," especially fear of socialist revolution. In the face of revolutionary mass movements, right-leaning opportunists are afraid of "trouble" here and afraid of "trouble" there, slandering revolutionary mass movements as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." The "revolution" in their minds is a "revolution" without "trouble," a "revolution" that takes steady steps, a "revolution" like a spring breeze ruffling a stagnant pool. No, this is not the revolution that the proletariat needs; this is the cancellation of the revolution, the opposition to the revolution.

    Revolution means "rebellion," which means "making trouble." Without destroying the old, one cannot establish the new. This revolutionary order is the most normal order in history.

### 右倾机会主义的“政治病”

    右倾机会主义的“政治病”
    老实说，我们对1958年的伟大成绩的总结和宣传，不是太“突出”了，而是做得太不够了。我们今后要进一步大讲特讲伟大的1958年，要让1958年永垂社会主义之青史，要让党中央和毛泽东同志所规定的党的社会主义建设的总路线在全国人民的生活里生根、开花和结果。
    在1958年这样一个伟大的群众运动当中，当然是不可能不产生一些暂时性的、局部性的缺点的。所有这些缺点加在一起，和1958年的伟大成绩相比，也仍然是一个指头和九个指头的关系。即使只有一个指头的缺点，党对于它也从来没有放松过。在党中央和毛主席的亲自领导下，及时地发现和克服了上面所说的那些缺点。可是，右倾机会主义分子却对于目前越来越有利的形势作出了悲观主义的估计，于是跑出来声色俱厉地指责我们的党“对缺点揭发得不够”。为什么他们死啃住这些已经解决了的，或者根本不存在的缺点不放呢？看来，他们无非是想把这一个指头的缺点夸大得比大腿还要粗，想拉住我们的后腿不让我们继续跃进，想用他们的右倾机会主义路线来代替党的总路线。他们咀嚼起缺点来是那样的津津有味，就和猫头鹰一样，离开了黑暗便活不下去。
    每一个比喻，都会有它的局限性。猫头鹰之所以害怕光明，喜欢黑暗，是因为生理上的原因。右倾机会主义分子毕竟是人，并不是猫头鹰，为什么他们也害怕光明，喜欢黑暗呢？这是因为他们害了一种政治上的病，这种病的名字就叫做“害怕革命的群众运动”，特别是害怕社会主义革命。在革命的群众运动面前，右倾机会主义分子这也怕出“乱子”，那也怕出“乱子”，诋毁革命的群众运动是“小资产阶级的狂热性”。他们心目中的“革命”，是不出“乱子”的“革命”，是迈着四平八稳的步子的“革命”，是春风吹皱一潭死水式的“革命”。不，这不是无产阶级所需要的革命，这是取消革命，是反对革命。
    革命就是“造反”，就是“闹乱子”。不破坏旧的，就不能建立新的。这种革命的秩序，才是历史上最正常的秩序。
