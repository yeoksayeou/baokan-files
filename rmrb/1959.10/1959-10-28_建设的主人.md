　　Construction Masters

　　The Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade has created new experience in rapid construction, completing a month's workload in nine and a half days, demonstrating the boundless power and wisdom of construction workers.

　　“The construction site is the battlefield, the tools are the weapons; sunset is a level ground, sunrise is a factory building,” these are the bold words and actions of the vast numbers of construction workers since the Great Leap Forward. Through the amazing achievements of the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade in rapid construction, we have once again seen the tremendous power generated by the great thought of "more, faster, better, and more economical". This thought has spurred thousands upon thousands of shock brigades to gallop forward with a high degree of conscious ownership, rapidly changing the "poor and blank" face of the motherland. Therefore, a high degree of conscious ownership and firm implementation of the General Line are precisely the source of strength for the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade's creation of miracles, and precisely what makes them valuable. With this kind of thinking, they regard the state's prescribed targets as their minimum requirements, and put forward higher targets for struggle; after one target is broken through, they immediately propose new leap forward targets, leaping again and again, never satisfied. With this kind of thinking, they are able to work with a spirit of racing against time, working without regard to remuneration, and not mentioning difficulties in work, so that one person's labor efficiency is equivalent to three people.

　　The brilliant achievements and advanced experience of the Zhang Baifa Work Team prove that rapid construction is a "more, faster, better, and more economical" construction method with unlimited vitality, and a concrete manifestation of the construction industry's implementation of the General Line. With thousands upon thousands of heroic collectives like the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade on the construction front, our country's construction undertaking will speed ahead at a high rate.

    建设的主人
    张百发青年突击队创造了快速施工的新经验，九天半完成了一个月的工作量，表现了建筑工人的无穷力量和智慧。
    “工地是战场，工具是刀枪；日落是平地，日出现厂房”，这是大跃进以来广大建筑工人的豪言壮语和行动。透过张百发突击队在快速施工上取得的惊人成就，我们又一次看到了“多快好省”这个伟大的思想所产生的巨大力量。这个思想策动了千千万万突击队，以高度自觉的主人翁姿态跃马飞奔，高速度地改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌。所以，高度自觉的主人翁思想和坚定地执行总路线，正是张百发突击队创造奇迹的力量的源泉，正是他们的可贵之处。有了这种思想，他们才把国家规定的指标当作自己的最低要求，而提出更高的奋斗指标；才在一个指标突破以后又立即提出新的跃进指标，一跃再跃，永不满足。有了这种思想，他们才能够以争分夺秒的精神进行工作，劳动不计报酬，工作不讲困难，作到一个人的劳动效率相当于三个人。
    张百发工作队的光辉成就和先进经验，证明了快速施工是具有无限生命力的多快好省的施工方法，是建筑业贯彻总路线的具体表现。在建筑战线上有了成千上万个张百发突击队式的英雄集体，我们国家的建筑事业就会高速度飞驰。
