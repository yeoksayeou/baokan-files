Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch: The 16th National Convention of the Japan Socialist Party concluded at 00:07 this morning. The convention passed a resolution to fully launch a movement to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and re-elected Suzuki Mosaburo and Asanuma Inejiro as Chairman and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, respectively.

　　The resolution pointed out that the global trend of demanding the elimination of the Cold War and peaceful coexistence is expanding daily. Public opinion within Japan demanding脱離 [separation from] the U.S. military system, the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and the adoption of a neutral policy is also rising rapidly. This trend is a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

　　The resolution stated that Japan's democratic forces are preparing to launch a nationwide unified action by the end of November, on a scale even larger than last year's struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from revising the "Security Treaty." The Socialist Party will strengthen unity, strive to advance this struggle, which will determine the fate of the Japanese nation, and strive for the victorious holding of the seventh and eighth national unified actions. At the same time, in the Diet, the Socialist Party will also launch a struggle centered on preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty."

　　The declaration adopted by the convention pointed out that the Japanese people are resolutely struggling to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and to realize Japan's neutrality. The declaration stated that members of the Japan Socialist Party must rise up and fight to win the final victory.

　　The convention also passed resolutions opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of the trade union movement and support for landlords.

　　The convention elected a new Central Executive Committee composed of fifteen members.

　　In his speech at the meeting, Suzuki Mosaburo said that the Socialist Party should go among the workers and peasants, organize and mobilize people from all walks of life, and establish the party's independence, overcoming the erroneous theory of a national party. He expressed his determination to handle party affairs with the determination to eliminate factionalism within the party. He said that the entire party must concentrate all its efforts to combine mass struggles with parliamentary struggles.

　　Suzuki concluded by saying that the Socialist Party opposes Japan's subordination to the United States, opposes the Liberal Democratic Party's reactionary policies, and guarantees to launch a head-on struggle against the policy of revising the "Security Treaty."

　　Asanuma Inejiro reported on party affairs at the meeting. He pointed out that the broad masses of the Japanese people hope that the Socialist Party will do its utmost to launch struggles in preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," demanding that the government provide relief to disaster victims, opposing the dismissal of workers by coal mining monopoly capital, and striving for Japan's independence and peace. He called on all party members to unite and work hard for this.

　　Asanuma also emphasized that the so-called "Socialist Party Reconstruction Comrades Association" centered on Nishio Suehiro must be disbanded. The convention heard the report of Ino Kozo, chairman of the Socialist Party's Supervisory Committee, on giving Nishio Suehiro a censure.

    全力阻止修改日美“安全条约”
    发表宣言要求党员一致奋起斗争
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本社会党第十六次全国代表大会在今晨零时七分闭幕。大会通过了全力展开阻止修改日美“安全条约”运动的决议，并再次选出铃木茂三郎和浅沼稻次郎为社会党的委员长和书记长。
    决议指出，世界上要求消除冷战与和平共处的潮流正在日益扩大，日本国内要求摆脱美国军事体系、恢复日中邦交和采取中立政策的舆论也在迅速高涨，这种趋势是对岸信介政府和自由民主党的沉重打击。
    决议说，日本的民主力量准备在11月底展开一个比去年反对修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争规模更加宏大的全民性统一行动，来阻止岸信介政府修改“安全条约”，社会党将加强团结，努力推进这个将决定日本民族命运的斗争，争取胜利地举行第七次和第八次全国统一行动。同时在国会里，社会党也要以阻止修改“安全条约”为中心展开斗争。
    大会通过的宣言指出，日本人民正在坚决斗争，阻止修改“安全条约”，争取恢复日中邦交和实现日本的中立。宣言表示，日本社会党员要奋起斗争，争取最后的胜利。
    大会还通过了反对岸信介政府镇压工会运动和扶植地主的决议。
    大会选出了由十五人组成的新的中央执行委员会。
    铃木茂三郎在会上致词时说，社会党要进入工人和农民中间，组织和动员各阶层国民，并且要确立党的独立性，克服错误的国民政党论。他表示要以消除党内派系的决心来处理党务。他说，全党必须集中全力，把群众斗争和议会斗争结合起来。
    铃木最后说，社会党反对日本从属于美国，反对自由民主党的反动政策，保证要同修改“安全条约”的政策展开正面斗争。
    浅沼稻次郎曾在会上报告了党务工作。他指出，广大日本人民希望社会党在阻止修改“安全条约”、要求政府救济灾民、反对煤矿业垄断资本解雇工人和争取日本的独立与和平方面，竭尽全力展开斗争。他号召全体党员团结起来为此努力。
    浅沼同时强调说，以西尾末广为中心的所谓“社会党重建同志会”必须解散。大会听取了社会党监察委员会委员长猪侯浩三的关于给西尾末广以谴责处分的报告。
