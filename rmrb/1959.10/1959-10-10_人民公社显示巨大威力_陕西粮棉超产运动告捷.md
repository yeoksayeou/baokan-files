Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 8th: Shaanxi Province has achieved an initial victory in its grain and cotton overproduction campaign. After extensive post-management by the broad masses of commune members, the province is expected to harvest more than 650 million *jin* of grain and 273,000 *dan* of ginned cotton than estimated before the campaign began. Judging from the yields of over eight million *mu* of crops already harvested, many regions, despite facing various disasters this year, have achieved a bumper harvest due to the mass movement to continuously overproduce and strengthen post-planting field management. In the Hanzhong Special District, the estimated yield of 1.7 million *mu* of rice will exceed 500 *jin* per *mu*. In the deep Qinling Mountains, the Xingping Production Team of the Huotai Commune in Zhen'an County harvested 1,003.3 *jin* of dry rice per *mu* from its 427 *mu* of rice paddies, more than double the average *mu* yield of last year. The 60,000 *mu* of corn in the Huazhou Commune of Weinan is expected to yield 300 *jin* per *mu*, which is 40 *jin* more than the estimate in late August. In Bin County on the Weibei Plateau, the average *mu* yield of over 17,000 *mu* of harvested autumn crops exceeds the planned yield by 5 to 40 *jin*. In the Jinghui Irrigation Area, a major cotton-producing area, cotton bolls are generally bursting, and preliminary estimates indicate that the yield of ginned cotton will generally be around 100 *jin* per *mu*.

The victory of the grain and cotton overproduction campaign in Shaanxi Province was achieved under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, through continuous anti-Rightist efforts, boosting morale, and adding new measures. In the early stages of the movement, some cadres and masses in drought-affected or non-drought-affected areas held a “fixed outcome” mentality. To combat this, all localities organized propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside, vigorously promoting the favorable situation and the superiority of the people's communes. At the same time, they held on-site meetings in advanced areas, using methods such as observation, calculation, and debate to break down various "fixed outcome" views, enabling the overproduction movement to proceed smoothly. In the Hanzhong Special District, 1.5 million people were involved in the overproduction movement by late August, and in seven days, they watered 300,000 *mu* of drought-stricken autumn fields and weeded them once.

In the overproduction movement, the people's communes displayed immense power. Many communes and production teams engaged in large-scale collaboration under the principles of equivalent exchange and mutual assistance and mutual benefit. In the Yan'an Special District, over 100,000 people participated in collaboration during the overproduction movement. In Yan'an County, 397 production teams from various communes transferred nearly 3,000 laborers to support 193 teams lacking labor, applying fertilizer and weeding autumn fields in a timely manner. Encouraged by the slogan "Strive for Overproduction, Vow to Seize a Greater Harvest," many areas not affected by disasters fought fiercely to achieve overproduction.

Another reason for the significant achievements of the province's overproduction campaign was the launch of a vigorous competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced. On September 1st, the Caizhou Commune of Weinan proposed to all communes in the province to carry out a competition of "Universally Irrigate Abundant Harvest Water, Apply More Overproduction Fertilizer, and Produce One More *Dou* of Grain," and many communes immediately responded. After the Bin County communes accepted the challenge, over 60,000 commune members formed more than 2,300 specialized teams and invested in field management. In early September, they applied "overproduction fertilizer" to 140,000 *mu* of autumn fields and irrigated "abundant harvest water" to 28,000 *mu* of autumn fields. This large-scale competition further promoted competition between management areas, production teams, and individual commune members. In the competition, on the one hand, both sides were striving to be the best, striving for first place, and seizing red flags; on the other hand, they were also caring for and helping each other. As long as they created good methods and good experiences, they told each other without reservation.

In the competition movement, Party and government leaders at all levels went to the front lines of production, organizing thousand-person and ten-thousand-person inspection teams, further increasing overproduction measures, further boosting enthusiasm, and further surpassing production targets.

Currently, the overproduction competition movement for autumn grain and cotton is still in full swing throughout the province. Areas with more late-autumn grain crops and cotton are determined to not rest until the grain and cotton are in hand and processed, and are carrying out a concentrated effort to reapply "yield-increasing fertilizer" and re-irrigate "abundant harvest water." Areas that have already begun harvesting are paying great attention to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and have generally established re-harvesting teams, picking up what is missed in the front, and in many places, the autumn grain is threshed again and again, striving to recover 5 to 10 *jin* more grain and cotton per *mu* than in previous years.

    人民公社显示巨大威力
    陕西粮棉超产运动告捷
    新华社西安8日电　陕西省粮、棉超产运动初步告捷。经过广大社员的后期加工管理，全省预计可比超产运动开展前多收粮食六亿五千多万斤，皮棉二十七万三千担。从已经收获登场的八百多万亩作物的产量看，许多地区在今年多灾的情况下，由于大搞超产再超产的群众运动，不断加强后期田间管理，终于获得了丰收。汉中专区一百七十万亩水稻，预计亩产可达五百斤以上。秦岭深山的镇安霍台公社杏坪生产队四百二十七亩水稻，每亩实产干稻一千零三斤三两，比去年平均亩产量高出一倍多。渭南华州公社六万亩玉米，亩产可达三百斤，比8月底估计每亩多收四十斤，渭北高原的邠县已收获的一万七千多亩秋作物，平均亩产可以超过计划产量五斤至四十斤。盛产棉花的泾惠灌区，棉桃普遍吐絮，初步测产，亩产皮棉一般在百斤左右。
    陕西省的粮、棉超产运动的胜利，是在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召下，经过不断反右倾、鼓干劲、添措施得到的。运动初期受旱或不旱地区，一些干部和群众存在着“定局论”的思想，各地一面组织宣传大军，深入农村，大讲有利形势和人民公社优越性，一面在先进地区召开现场会议，通过看、算、辩等办法，打破了各式各样的“定局论”，使超产运动得以顺利开展。汉中专区8月下旬卷入超产运动的达一百五十万人，在七天内给三十万亩受旱秋田浇了一次水，锄了一次草。
    在超产运动中，人民公社显示了巨大的威力，很多公社、生产队，在等价交换和互助互利的原则下，大搞协作。延安专区在超产运动中参加协作的，有十万多人次；延安县各公社有三百九十七个生产队调出近三千个劳力，支援缺少劳力的一百九十三个队，及时给秋田施了肥、拔了草。许多没有受灾的地区，在“力争超产，誓夺更大丰收”的口号鼓舞下，紧张奋战夺超产。
    全省超产运动获得显著成效的另一原因，是开展了轰轰烈烈的学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛运动。9月1日，渭南菜州公社向全省各公社倡议开展“普浇丰收水，多施超产肥，多产一斗粮”的竞赛，很多公社立即起而响应。邠县各公社应战后，六万多社员，组成了二千三百多个专业队，投入了田间管理，在9月上旬，就给十四万亩秋田施了“超产肥”，二万八千亩秋田浇了“丰收水”。这个大范围的竞赛，又促进了管理区与管理区，生产队与生产队和社员个人与个人之间的竞赛。在竞赛中，一方面，双方都在争上游，争第一，夺红旗；一方面，又互相关怀，互相帮助，只要自己创造了好办法，好经验，就毫无保留地告诉对方。
    在竞赛运动中，各级党、政领导干部走上了生产的第一线，组织千人、万人检查团，使超产措施一加再加，干劲一鼓再鼓，产量一超再超。
    现在，秋粮和棉花的超产竞赛运动，仍在全省热烈进行。晚秋粮食作物和棉花较多的地区，以“粮棉不到手，加工不到头”的意志，突击再施“增产肥”、再浇“丰收水”。已经开始收割的地区，十分重视细收细打，普遍建立了复收小组，前边收，后边拾，许多地方把秋粮打了再打，争取每亩比往年多收回粮棉五至十斤。
